<s> i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past </s> (8230-279154-0014)
<s> they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past </s> (8230-279154-0015)
<s> in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some remembered event </s> (8230-279154-0016)
<s> there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events </s> (8230-279154-0018)

<s> if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple </s> (8230-279154-0020)

<s> in this case as in most others what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague </s> (8230-279154-0023)
<s> the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past </s> (8230-279154-0024)
<s> this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory </s> (8230-279154-0026)

<s> the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it </s> (8230-279154-0029)
<s> they give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory </s> (8230-279154-0031)
<s> it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge </s> (8230-279154-0032)
<s> it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time </s> (8230-279154-0033)
<s> whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar </s> (8230-279154-0034)
<s> thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone </s> (8230-279154-0035)
<s> a further stage is recognition </s> (8230-279154-0036)
<s> recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment </s> (8230-279154-0037)
<s> we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word </s> (8230-279154-0038)
<s> this knowledge is memory in one sense though in another it is not </s> (8230-279154-0039)
<s> there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before </s> (8230-279154-0040)
<s> the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important </s> (8230-279154-0041)

<s> of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition </s> (8230-279154-0043)

<s> consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country </s> (3570-5695-0013)
<s> among the country population its place is to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute </s> (3570-5695-0014)

<s> under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset </s> (3570-5696-0000)
<s> but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the quasi peaceable culture </s> (3570-5696-0001)

<s> the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste </s> (3570-5696-0007)
<s> but it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterized as wasteful </s> (3570-5696-0008)
