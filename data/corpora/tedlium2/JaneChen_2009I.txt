JaneChen_2009I@16.79:31.30 CLOSE YOUR EYES AND OPEN YOUR HANDS NOW IMAGINE WHAT YOU COULD PLACE IN YOUR HANDS AN APPLE MAYBE YOUR WALLET NOW OPEN YOUR EYES WHAT ABOUT A LIFE
JaneChen_2009I@31.42:43.92 WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS A PREMATURE BABY HE LOOKS LIKE HE 'S RESTING PEACEFULLY BUT IN FACT HE 'S STRUGGLING TO STAY ALIVE BECAUSE HE CAN'T REGULATE HIS OWN BODY TEMPERATURE THIS BABY IS SO TINY HE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH FAT ON HIS BODY TO STAY WARM
JaneChen_2009I@57.50:71.14 THE REASON IS BECAUSE IN THE FIRST MONTH OF A BABY 'S LIFE ITS ONLY JOB IS TO GROW IF IT'S BATTLING HYPOTHERMIA ITS ORGANS CAN'T DEVELOP NORMALLY RESULTING IN A RANGE OF HEALTH PROBLEMS FROM DIABETES TO HEART DISEASE TO LOW I Q
JaneChen_2009I@71.82:79.52 IMAGINE MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS COULD BE PREVENTED IF THESE BABIES WERE JUST KEPT WARM THAT IS THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF AN INCUBATOR
JaneChen_2009I@87.75:99.71 AS A RESULT PARENTS RESORT TO LOCAL SOLUTIONS LIKE TYING HOT WATER BOTTLES AROUND THEIR BABIES BODIES OR PLACING THEM UNDER LIGHT BULBS LIKE THE ONES YOU SEE HERE METHODS THAT ARE BOTH INEFFECTIVE AND UNSAFE
JaneChen_2009I@100.07:109.04 I'VE SEEN THIS FIRSTHAND OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON ONE OF MY FIRST TRIPS TO INDIA I MET THIS YOUNG WOMAN SEVITHA WHO HAD JUST GIVEN BIRTH TO A TINY PREMATURE BABY
JaneChen_2009I@110.24:121.41 SHE TOOK HER BABY TO THE NEAREST VILLAGE CLINIC AND THE DOCTOR ADVISED HER TO TAKE RANI A CITY HOSPITAL SO SHE COULD BE PLACED IN AN INCUBATOR BUT THAT HOSPITAL WAS OVER FOUR HOURS AWAY
JaneChen_2009I@121.57:126.03 AND SEVITHA DIDN'T HAVE THE MEANS TO GET THERE SO HER BABY DIED
JaneChen_2009I@140.91:151.94 WE NEEDED SOMETHING THAT WAS PORTABLE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE STERILIZED AND REUSED ACROSS MULTIPLE BABIES AND SOMETHING ULTRA LOW COST COMPARED TO THE TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT AN INCUBATOR IN THE U S COSTS
JaneChen_2009I@152.84:165.59 SO THIS IS WHAT WE CAME UP WITH WHAT YOU SEE HERE LOOKS NOTHING LIKE AN INCUBATOR IT LOOKS LIKE A SMALL SLEEPING BAG FOR A BABY YOU CAN OPEN IT UP COMPLETELY IT'S WATERPROOF THERE IS NO SEAMS INSIDE SO YOU CAN STERILIZE IT VERY EASILY
JaneChen_2009I@165.98:176.79 BUT THE MAGIC IS IN THIS POUCH OF WAX THIS IS A PHASE CHANGE MATERIAL IT'S A WAX LIKE SUBSTANCE WITH A MELTING POINT OF HUMAN BODY TEMPERATURE THIRTY SEVEN DEGREES CELSIUS
JaneChen_2009I@177.10:183.48 YOU CAN MELT THIS SIMPLY USING HOT WATER AND THEN WHEN IT MELTS IT'S ABLE TO MAINTAIN ONE CONSTANT TEMPERATURE
JaneChen_2009I@183.68:191.87 FOR FOUR TO SIX HOURS AT A TIME AFTER WHICH YOU SIMPLY REHEAT THE POUCH SO YOU THEN PLACE IT INTO THIS LITTLE POCKET BACK HERE
JaneChen_2009I@195.74:207.32 AND IT CREATES A WARM MICRO ENVIRONMENT FOR THE BABY LOOKS SIMPLE BUT WE'VE REITERATED THIS DOZENS OF TIMES BY GOING INTO THE FIELD TO TALK TO DOCTORS MOMS AND CLINICIANS
JaneChen_2009I@207.60:214.13 TO ENSURE THAT THIS REALLY MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES WE PLAN TO LAUNCH THIS PRODUCT IN INDIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN
JaneChen_2009I@215.03:221.94 AND THE TARGET PRICE POINT WILL BE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS LESS THAN ZERO POINT ONE PERCENT OF THE COST OF A TRADITIONAL INCUBATOR
JaneChen_2009I@222.35:229.86 OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WE HOPE TO SAVE THE LIVES OF ALMOST A MILLION BABIES BUT THE LONGER TERM SOCIAL IMPACT IS A REDUCTION IN POPULATION GROWTH
JaneChen_2009I@230.29:240.76 THIS SEEMS COUNTER INTUITIVE BUT TURNS OUT THAT AS INFANT MORTALITY IS REDUCED POPULATION SIZES ALSO DECREASE BECAUSE PARENTS DON'T NEED TO ANTICIPATE THAT THEIR BABIES ARE GOING TO DIE
JaneChen_2009I@241.24:249.15 WE HOPE THAT THE EMBRACE INFANT WARMER AND OTHER SIMPLE INNOVATIONS LIKE THIS REPRESENT A NEW TREND FOR THE FUTURE OF TECHNOLOGY
JaneChen_2009I@249.71:262.13 SIMPLE LOCALIZED AFFORDABLE SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE HUGE SOCIAL IMPACT IN DESIGNING THIS WE FOLLOWED A FEW BASIC PRINCIPLES WE REALLY TRIED TO UNDERSTAND THE END USER IN THIS CASE PEOPLE LIKE
JaneChen_2009I@274.02:281.35 IN DOING THIS I BELIEVE WE CAN TRULY BRING TECHNOLOGY TO THE MASSES AND WE CAN SAVE MILLIONS OF LIVES THROUGH THE SIMPLE WARMTH OF AN EMBRACE
