KiranBirSethi_2009I IS A GOOD WORD EVEN IN THE TIMES OF H ONE N ONE I LIKE THE WORD LAUGHTER IS CONTAGIOUS
KiranBirSethi_2009I BUT FOR ME WHAT WAS CONTAGIOUS ABOUT ALL OF THEM WAS THAT THEY WERE INFECTED BY SOMETHING I CALL THE I CAN BUG
KiranBirSethi_2009I THE QUESTION IS WHY ONLY THEM IN A COUNTRY OF A BILLION PEOPLE AND SOME WHY SO FEW IS IT LUCK IS IT CHANCE CAN WE ALL NOT SYSTEMATICALLY AND CONSCIOUSLY GET INFECTED
KiranBirSethi_2009I WHEN AS A STUDENT OF THE DESIGN COLLEGE I ENCOUNTERED ADULTS WHO ACTUALLY BELIEVED IN MY IDEAS CHALLENGED ME AND HAD LOTS OF CUPS OF
KiranBirSethi_2009I AND I WAS STRUCK BY JUST HOW WONDERFUL IT FELT AND HOW CONTAGIOUS THAT FEELING WAS I ALSO REALIZED I SHOULD HAVE GOT INFECTED WHEN I WAS SEVEN
KiranBirSethi_2009I SO WHEN I STARTED RIVERSIDE SCHOOL TEN YEARS AGO IT BECAME A LAB A LAB TO PROTOTYPE AND REFINE A DESIGN PROCESS THAT COULD CONSCIOUSLY INFECT THE MIND WITH THE I CAN BUG
KiranBirSethi_2009I AND I UNCOVERED THAT IF LEARNING IS EMBEDDED IN REAL WORLD CONTEXT THAT IF YOU BLUR THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN SCHOOL AND LIFE THEN CHILDREN GO THROUGH A JOURNEY OF AWARE WHERE THEY CAN SEE THE CHANGE
KiranBirSethi_2009I BE CHANGED AND THEN EMPOWER LEAD THE CHANGE AND THAT DIRECTLY INCREASED
KiranBirSethi_2009I TO EXPERIENCE WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A CHILD LABORER IT TRANSFORMED THEM WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS THEIR JOURNEY AND THEN THEIR UTTER CONVICTION THAT THEY COULD GO OUT AND CHANGE THE WORLD
KiranBirSethi_2009I HIS FACE CHANGES BECAUSE HE 'S BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS SHIFTED THAT
KiranBirSethi_2009I FROM TEACHER TOLD ME TO I AM DOING IT AND THAT'S THE I CAN MINDSHIFT AND IT IS A PROCESS THAT CAN BE ENERGIZED AND
KiranBirSethi_2009I BUT WE HAD PARENTS WHO SAID OKAY MAKING OUR CHILDREN GOOD HUMAN BEINGS IS ALL VERY WELL BUT WHAT ABOUT MATH AND SCIENCE AND ENGLISH SHOW US THE GRADES AND WE DID THE DATA WAS CONCLUSIVE
KiranBirSethi_2009I WHEN CHILDREN ARE EMPOWERED NOT ONLY DO THEY DO GOOD THEY DO WELL IN FACT VERY WELL AS YOU CAN SEE IN THIS NATIONAL BENCHMARKING ASSESSMENT TAKEN BY OVER TWO THOUSAND SCHOOLS IN INDIA
KiranBirSethi_2009I SO ON AUGUST FIFTEENTH INDEPENDENCE DAY TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THE CHILDREN OF RIVERSIDE SET OUT TO INFECT
KiranBirSethi_2009I BUSINESSES AND BASICALLY SAID WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO WAKE UP AND RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL THAT RESIDES IN EVERY CHILD WHEN WILL YOU INCLUDE THE CHILD IN THE CITY BASICALLY OPEN YOUR HEARTS AND YOUR MINDS TO THE CHILD SO HOW DID THE CITY RESPOND
KiranBirSethi_2009I SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN EVERY OTHER MONTH THE CITY CLOSES DOWN THE BUSIEST STREETS FOR TRAFFIC AND CONVERTS IT INTO A PLAYGROUND FOR CHILDREN
KiranBirSethi_2009I AND CHILDHOOD HERE WAS A CITY TELLING ITS CHILD YOU CAN A GLIMPSE OF INFECTION IN
KiranBirSethi_2009I ALL
KiranBirSethi_2009I IS AN ORGANIZATION WHICH HAS BEEN DOING THINGS FOR KIDS EARLIER AND WE PLAN TO EXTEND THIS TO OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY
KiranBirSethi_2009I BECAUSE OF THAT AHMEDABAD IS KNOWN AS
KiranBirSethi_2009I INDIA 'S FIRST CHILD FRIENDLY CITY SO YOU'RE GETTING THE PATTERN FIRST TWO HUNDRED CHILDREN AT RIVERSIDE THEN THIRTY THOUSAND CHILDREN IN AHMEDABAD AND GROWING IT WAS TIME NOW TO INFECT INDIA
KiranBirSethi_2009I SO ON AUGUST FIFTEENTH AGAIN INDEPENDENCE DAY TWO THOUSAND AND NINE EMPOWERED WITH THE SAME PROCESS WE EMPOWERED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN TO SAY
KiranBirSethi_2009I I CAN HOW WE DESIGNED A SIMPLE TOOLKIT CONVERTED IT INTO EIGHT LANGUAGES AND REACHED THIRTY TWO THOUSAND SCHOOLS
KiranBirSethi_2009I I MEAN IT WAS INCREDIBLE BASICALLY AGAIN REAFFIRMING THAT WHEN ADULTS BELIEVE IN CHILDREN AND SAY YOU CAN THEN THEY WILL INFECTION IN INDIA
KiranBirSethi_2009I AND
KiranBirSethi_2009I AND WRITE I
KiranBirSethi_2009I GOING OUT PRETTY DIFFICULT BUT THEY DID IT
KiranBirSethi_2009I ME THAT THEY HAD
KiranBirSethi_2009I SO TODAY WHO IS IT GOING TO TAKE TO SPREAD THE INFECTION FROM ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN TO THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION CHILDREN IN INDIA
