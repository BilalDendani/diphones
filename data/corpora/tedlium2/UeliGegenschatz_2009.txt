UeliGegenschatz_2009@18.61:19.72 I STARTED
UeliGegenschatz_2009@25.64:34.80 WITH THE POSSIBILITY TO FLY CROSS COUNTRY DISTANCE JUST WITH THE USE OF THERMALS TO SOAR ALSO DIFFERENT AEROBATIC
UeliGegenschatz_2009@35.72:43.62 POSSIBLE WITH A PARAGLIDER FROM THERE I STARTED WITH SKYDIVING IN THIS PICTURE YOU CAN SEE THERE IS A FOUR WAY SKYDIVE
UeliGegenschatz_2009@54.29:66.11 FOR THE FILM ITSELF AND ALSO FOR THE JUDGING FROM REGULAR RELATIVE SKYDIVING I WENT ON TO FREEFLYING FREEFLYING IS MORE THE THREE DIMENSIONAL
UeliGegenschatz_2009@75.47:84.09 FLYING HEAD DOWN AND THAT'S ME IN THE BACKGROUND CARVING AROUND THE WHOLE FORMATION IN FREEFALL ALSO WITH THE HELMET CAM TO FILM THIS JUMP
UeliGegenschatz_2009@86.11:95.50 FROM FREEFLYING I WENT ON TO SKYSURFING SKYSURFING IS SKYDIVING WITH A BOARD ON THE FEET YOU CAN IMAGINE WITH THIS BIG
UeliGegenschatz_2009@97.22:107.37 A SKYSURFING BOARD THERE IS A LOT OF FORCE A LOT OF POWER OF COURSE I CAN USE THIS POWER FOR EXAMPLE FOR NICE SPINNING WE CALL IT HELICOPTER MOVES
UeliGegenschatz_2009@109.29:117.76 FROM THERE I WENT ON TO WINGSUIT FLYING WINGSUIT FLYING IS A SUIT THAT I CAN MAKE FLY JUST ONLY WITH MY BODY
UeliGegenschatz_2009@118.75:128.09 PUT SOME TENSION ON MY BODY TENSION ON MY SUIT I CAN MAKE IT FLY AND AS YOU SEE THE FALL RATE IS MUCH MUCH SLOWER BECAUSE OF THE

UeliGegenschatz_2009@145.07:152.40 FROM THERE WITH ALL THE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE FROM PARAGLIDING AND ALL THE DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES IN SKYDIVING I WENT ON TO BASE JUMPING
UeliGegenschatz_2009@152.81:158.65 BASE JUMPING IS SKYDIVING FROM FIXED OBJECTS LIKE BUILDINGS
UeliGegenschatz_2009@161.21:173.59 AND EARTH MEANING MOUNTAINS CLIFFS IT'S FOR SURE FOR ME IT'S THE ULTIMATE FEELING OF BEING IN FREE FALL WITH ALL THE VISUAL REFERENCES
UeliGegenschatz_2009@174.74:185.15 SO MY GOAL SOON WAS TO DISCOVER NEW PLACES THAT NOBODY HAD JUMPED BEFORE SO IN SUMMER TWO THOUSAND I WAS THE FIRST TO BASE JUMP THE EIGER NORTH FACE IN SWITZERLAND
UeliGegenschatz_2009@185.86:193.87 TWO YEARS AFTER THIS I WAS THE FIRST TO BASE JUMP FROM MATTERHORN A VERY FAMOUS MOUNTAIN THAT PROBABLY EVERYBODY KNOWS IN HERE

UeliGegenschatz_2009@239.57:252.20 WAS FREEZING PRETTY MUCH EXCEPT ME BECAUSE IT WAS VERY COLD IN AUSTRIA WHERE WE DID THIS FILMING EVERYBODY SITTING IN A BASKET AND I WAS ON TOP OF THE BALLOON READY TO SLIDE DOWN WITH MY
UeliGegenschatz_2009@258.20:260.73 FROM A MOVING TRUCK ON THE
UeliGegenschatz_2009@279.68:282.26 OF COURSE YOU NEED TO BE IN PHYSICAL

UeliGegenschatz_2009@290.33:290.65 AND
UeliGegenschatz_2009@305.50:313.58 SO FOR TWO THOUSAND AND NINE I'M TRAINING HARD FOR MY TWO NEW PROJECTS THE FIRST ONE I WANT TO SET A
UeliGegenschatz_2009@314.99:323.01 IN FLYING FROM A CLIFF WITH MY WINGSUIT AND I WANT TO SET A NEW RECORD WITH THE LONGEST DISTANCE
UeliGegenschatz_2009@325.14:332.10 FOR MY SECOND PROJECT I HAVE A SENSATIONAL IDEA OF A JUMP THAT NEVER HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE
UeliGegenschatz_2009@335.92:345.19 FOLLOWING MOVIE YOU WILL SEE THAT I'M MUCH BETTER IN FLYING A WINGSUIT THAN SPEAKING IN ENGLISH ENJOY AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH
UeliGegenschatz_2009@602.02:609.12 PRETTY MUCH I BELIEVE THIS IS PROBABLY THE CLOSEST POSSIBILITY TO COME TO THE DREAM OF BEING ABLE TO FLY
UeliGegenschatz_2009@622.24:632.80 NOT POSSIBLE TO LAND A WINGSUIT YET JC YET BUT PEOPLE ARE TRYING ARE YOU AMONG THOSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COMMIT ARE YOU AMONG THOSE TRYING TO DO IT UE IT'S A DREAM IT'S A DREAM YEAH WE'RE STILL WORKING ON IT
UeliGegenschatz_2009@632.97:638.58 AND WE'RE DEVELOPING THE WINGSUITS TO GET BETTER PERFORMANCE TO GET MORE KNOWLEDGE AND
UeliGegenschatz_2009@656.30:669.33 NO SMOKE IS FOR TWO REASONS YOU CAN SEE THE SPEED YOU CAN SEE THE WAY WHERE I WAS FLYING THAT'S REASON NUMBER ONE AND REASON NUMBER TWO IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR THE CAMERA GUY TO FILM
UeliGegenschatz_2009@670.83:681.64 SO THE WINGSUIT IS SET UP TO DELIBERATELY RELEASE SMOKE SO THAT YOU CAN BE TRACKED ONE MORE QUESTION WHAT DO YOU DO TO TO COVER YOUR FACE BECAUSE I JUST KEEP THINKING OF GOING THAT FAST AND HAVING YOUR WHOLE FACE SMUSHED BACKWARDS ARE YOU IN A
UeliGegenschatz_2009@688.14:690.11 AND IS THAT HOW YOU USUALLY
UeliGegenschatz_2009@691.22:701.79 A HELMET IN THE MOUNTAINS I'M ALWAYS WEARING A HELMET BECAUSE OF LANDINGS USUALLY IT'S DIFFICULT IT'S NOT LIKE REGULAR SKYDIVING WHERE YOU HAVE LIKE THE BIG LANDINGS SO YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED
