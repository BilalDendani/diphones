YvesRossy_2011G@83.41:90.23 MANY OF THE TESTS ARE CONDUCTED WHILE YVES IS STRAPPED ONTO THE WING BECAUSE YVES BODY IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE AIRCRAFT
YvesRossy_2011G@182.52:185.19 AND
YvesRossy_2011G@210.35:212.24 I
YvesRossy_2011G@234.71:249.56 THE WING IS OPEN SO OUR FIRST CRITICAL MOMENT IT 'S OPEN HE IS DOWN IS HE FLYING COMMENTATOR TWO IT LOOKS LIKE HE 'S STABILIZED HE 'S STARTING TO MAKE HIS CLIMB COMMENTATOR THERE 'S THAT NINETY DEGREE TURN YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING HIM OUT HE 'S OUT OVER THE CHANNEL
YvesRossy_2011G@279.67:284.26 AND WHAT HE 'S GOING TO DO AS HE APPROACHES THE GROUND IS PULL DOWN ON THOSE TOGGLES
YvesRossy_2011G@378.57:380.41 AND THAT 'S THE

YvesRossy_2011G@556.38:575.21 THAT MEANS IF I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE FIRST ONE I PULL I STILL HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO OPEN THE SECOND ONE AND THIS IS MY LIFE THAT 'S THE REAL IMPORTANT THING ABOUT SAFETY I DID USE THAT DURING THESE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS ABOUT TWENTY TIMES

YvesRossy_2011G@686.87:705.68 AND YOU CAN ADAPT REALLY PRECISELY WITH THAT I HAVE TO ADAPT TO SOMETHING NEW THAT MEANS IMPROVISE SO IT 'S REALLY A PLAY BETWEEN THESE TWO APPROACHES SOMETHING THAT I KNOW VERY WELL THESE PRINCIPLES FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE TWO ENGINES ON AN AIRBUS
YvesRossy_2011G@712.82:721.65 THAT 'S MY EJECTION SEAT SO I HAVE THE APPROACH OF A PROFESSIONAL PILOT WITH THE RESPECT
YvesRossy_2011G@735.61:748.78 AND THEN I STABILIZE AND ACCORDING TO MY ALTITUDE I CONTINUE ON TWO OR THREE ENGINES IT 'S SOMETIMES POSSIBLE IT 'S QUITE COMPLICATED TO EXPLAIN BUT ACCORDING TO WHICH
YvesRossy_2011G@864.42:873.75 THANKS TO THE INCREASING TECHNOLOGY BETTER TECHNOLOGY IT WILL BE SAFE AND I HOPE IT WILL BE FOR EVERYBODY
