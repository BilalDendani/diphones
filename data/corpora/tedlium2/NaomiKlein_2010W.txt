NaomiKlein_2010W HAVE BEEN TRACKING THE TRAVELS OF BP 'S OIL IN THE GULF OF MEXICO
NaomiKlein_2010W THIS IS THE BOAT WE WERE ON BY THE WAY
NaomiKlein_2010W THE SCIENTISTS I WAS WITH WERE NOT STUDYING THE EFFECT OF THE OIL AND DISPERSANTS ON THE BIG STUFF THE BIRDS THE TURTLES
NaomiKlein_2010W THE DOLPHINS THE GLAMOROUS STUFF THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE REALLY LITTLE STUFF THAT GETS EATEN BY THE SLIGHTLY LESS LITTLE STUFF
NaomiKlein_2010W THAT EVENTUALLY GETS EATEN BY THE BIG STUFF
NaomiKlein_2010W WHAT THEY'RE FINDING IS THAT EVEN TRACE AMOUNTS OF OIL AND DISPERSANTS CAN BE HIGHLY TOXIC TO PHYTOPLANKTON WHICH IS VERY BAD NEWS BECAUSE SO MUCH LIFE DEPENDS ON
NaomiKlein_2010W SO CONTRARY TO WHAT WE HEARD A FEW MONTHS BACK
NaomiKlein_2010W HOW SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THAT OIL SORT OF MAGICALLY DISAPPEARED AND WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT THIS DISASTER IS STILL UNFOLDING IT'S STILL WORKING ITS WAY UP THE FOOD CHAIN
NaomiKlein_2010W SHE POINTED OUT THAT THE CONTROL MEN AS SHE CALLED THEM WHO CARPET BOMBED TOWNS AND FIELDS WITH TOXIC INSECTICIDES LIKE DDT WERE ONLY TRYING TO KILL THE LITTLE STUFF THE INSECTS
NaomiKlein_2010W NOT THE BIRDS BUT THEY FORGOT THIS THE FACT THAT BIRDS DINE ON GRUBS THAT ROBINS EAT LOTS OF WORMS NOW SATURATED WITH DDT
NaomiKlein_2010W THE TITLE SILENT SPRING
NaomiKlein_2010W THE MEANING OF THIS DISASTER WITH WHAT IT MEANT TO WITNESS A HOLE RIPPED IN OUR WORLD
NaomiKlein_2010W WITH WHAT IT MEANT TO WATCH THE CONTENTS OF THE EARTH GUSH FORTH ON LIVE TV TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY FOR MONTHS
NaomiKlein_2010W WITH OUR LACK OF CONTROL
NaomiKlein_2010W AS THE OIL BURST OUT OF EVERY ATTEMPT TO CONTAIN IT TOP HATS TOP KILLS AND MOST MEMORABLY
NaomiKlein_2010W THE JUNK SHOT THE BRIGHT IDEA OF FIRING OLD TIRES AND GOLF BALLS DOWN THAT HOLE IN THE WORLD BUT EVEN MORE STRIKING THAN THE FEROCIOUS POWER EMANATING FROM THAT WELL
NaomiKlein_2010W RECKLESSNESS WITH WHICH THAT POWER WAS UNLEASHED THE CARELESSNESS THE LACK OF PLANNING THAT CHARACTERIZED THE OPERATION FROM DRILLING TO
NaomiKlein_2010W WE HAVE BECOME FAR TOO WILLING TO GAMBLE WITH THINGS THAT ARE PRECIOUS AND IRREPLACEABLE
NaomiKlein_2010W AND TO DO SO WITHOUT A BACK UP PLAN WITHOUT AN EXIT STRATEGY
NaomiKlein_2010W AND BP WAS HARDLY OUR FIRST EXPERIENCE OF THIS IN RECENT YEARS OUR LEADERS BARREL INTO WARS TELLING THEMSELVES HAPPY STORIES ABOUT CAKEWALKS AND WELCOME PARADES
NaomiKlein_2010W YEARS OF DEADLY DAMAGE CONTROL FRANKENSTEINS OF SIEGES AND SURGES AND COUNTER INSURGENCIES AND ONCE AGAIN NO EXIT STRATEGY
NaomiKlein_2010W OUR FINANCIAL WIZARDS ROUTINELY FALL VICTIM TO SIMILAR OVERCONFIDENCE
NaomiKlein_2010W THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST REACH FOR THE FINANCIAL EQUIVALENT OF THE JUNK SHOT IN THIS CASE THROWING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MUCH NEEDED PUBLIC MONEY DOWN A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF
NaomiKlein_2010W AS WITH BP THE HOLE DOES GET PLUGGED AT LEAST TEMPORARILY BUT NOT BEFORE EXACTING A TREMENDOUS PRICE
NaomiKlein_2010W WHY WE KEEP LETTING THIS HAPPEN BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF WHAT MAY BE OUR HIGHEST STAKES GAMBLE OF ALL DECIDING WHAT TO DO OR NOT TO DO ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE
NaomiKlein_2010W A GREAT DEAL OF TIME IS SPENT IN THIS COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD INSIDE THE CLIMATE DEBATE ON THE QUESTION
NaomiKlein_2010W WHAT IF THE IPC SCIENTISTS ARE ALL WRONG
NaomiKlein_2010W A FAR MORE RELEVANT QUESTION AS MIT PHYSICIST EVELYN FOX KELLER PUTS IT IS WHAT IF THOSE SCIENTISTS ARE RIGHT
NaomiKlein_2010W BASED ON THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE
NaomiKlein_2010W THE THEORY THAT HOLDS THAT WHEN HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AT RISK AND WHEN THE POTENTIAL DAMAGE
NaomiKlein_2010W IS IRREVERSIBLE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT FOR PERFECT SCIENTIFIC CERTAINTY BETTER TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION
NaomiKlein_2010W THE BURDEN OF PROVING THAT A PRACTICE IS SAFE SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE PUBLIC
NaomiKlein_2010W THAT WOULD BE HARMED BUT RATHER ON THE INDUSTRY THAT STANDS TO PROFIT
NaomiKlein_2010W BUT CLIMATE POLICY IN THE WEALTHY WORLD TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH A THING EXISTS IS NOT BASED ON PRECAUTION BUT RATHER ON COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS
NaomiKlein_2010W SO RATHER THAN ASKING AS PRECAUTION WOULD DEMAND WHAT CAN WE DO AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO AVOID POTENTIAL CATASTROPHE
NaomiKlein_2010W WE ASK BIZARRE QUESTIONS LIKE THIS
NaomiKlein_2010W OR WE ASK HOW MUCH HOTTER CAN WE LET THE PLANET GET AND STILL SURVIVE
NaomiKlein_2010W THE WAY THE ASSUMPTION THAT WE CAN SAFELY CONTROL THE EARTH 'S AWESOMELY COMPLEX CLIMATE SYSTEM AS IF IT HAD A THERMOSTAT MAKING THE PLANET NOT TOO HOT NOT TOO COLD BUT JUST RIGHT SORT OF GOLDILOCKS STYLE
NaomiKlein_2010W THIS IS PURE FANTASY AND IT'S NOT COMING FROM THE CLIMATE SCIENTISTS IT'S COMING FROM THE ECONOMISTS IMPOSING THEIR MECHANISTIC THINKING ON THE SCIENCE
NaomiKlein_2010W THE FACT IS THAT WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WARMING THAT WE CREATE WILL BE UTTERLY OVERWHELMED BY FEEDBACK LOOPS
NaomiKlein_2010W SO ONCE AGAIN WHY DO WE TAKE THESE CRAZY RISKS WITH THE PRECIOUS
NaomiKlein_2010W A RANGE OF EXPLANATIONS MAY BE POPPING INTO YOUR MIND BY NOW LIKE GREED THIS IS A POPULAR EXPLANATION AND THERE'S LOTS OF TRUTH TO IT BECAUSE TAKING BIG RISKS AS WE ALL KNOW PAYS A LOT OF MONEY
NaomiKlein_2010W AND GREED AND HUBRIS ARE INTIMATELY INTERTWINED WHEN IT COMES TO RECKLESSNESS FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE A THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD BANKER TAKING HOME ONE HUNDRED TIMES MORE THAN A BRAIN SURGEON
NaomiKlein_2010W THEN YOU NEED A NARRATIVE YOU NEED A STORY THAT MAKES THAT DISPARITY OKAY
NaomiKlein_2010W AND YOU ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS YOU'RE EITHER
NaomiKlein_2010W AN INCREDIBLY GOOD SCAMMER
NaomiKlein_2010W AND YOU'RE GETTING AWAY WITH IT YOU GAMED THE SYSTEM OR YOU'RE SOME KIND OF BOY GENIUS THE LIKES OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN
NaomiKlein_2010W WAY TONY HAYWARD THE FORMER CEO OF BP HAD A PLAQUE ON HIS DESK INSCRIBED WITH THIS INSPIRATIONAL SLOGAN
NaomiKlein_2010W WHAT WOULD YOU ATTEMPT TO DO IF YOU KNEW YOU COULD NOT FAIL
NaomiKlein_2010W NOW THIS IS ACTUALLY A POPULAR PLAQUE AND THIS IS A CROWD OF OVERACHIEVERS SO I'M BETTING THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE THIS PLAQUE
NaomiKlein_2010W DON'T FEEL ASHAMED PUTTING FEAR OF FAILURE OUT OF YOUR MIND CAN BE A VERY GOOD THING IF YOU'RE TRAINING FOR A TRIATHLON OR PREPARING TO GIVE A TEDTALK
NaomiKlein_2010W BUT PERSONALLY I THINK PEOPLE WITH THE POWER TO DETONATE OUR ECONOMY AND RAVAGE OUR ECOLOGY WOULD DO BETTER
NaomiKlein_2010W HAVING A PICTURE OF ICARUS HANGING
NaomiKlein_2010W FROM THE WALL BECAUSE MAYBE NOT THAT ONE IN PARTICULAR BUT I WANT THEM THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF FAILURE ALL OF THE TIME SO WE HAVE
NaomiKlein_2010W WE'VE GOT OVERCONFIDENCE HUBRIS
NaomiKlein_2010W I'M NOT GOING TO BELABOR THIS POINT BUT STUDIES DO SHOW THAT AS INVESTORS WOMEN ARE MUCH LESS PRONE TO TAKING RECKLESS RISKS
NaomiKlein_2010W PRECISELY BECAUSE AS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD WOMEN TEND NOT TO SUFFER FROM OVERCONFIDENCE IN THE SAME WAY THAT
NaomiKlein_2010W SO IT TURNS OUT THAT BEING PAID LESS AND PRAISED LESS HAS ITS UPSIDES FOR SOCIETY AT LEAST
NaomiKlein_2010W THE FLIP SIDE OF THIS IS THAT
NaomiKlein_2010W BEING TOLD THAT YOU ARE GIFTED CHOSEN AND BORN TO RULE HAS DISTINCT SOCIETAL DOWNSIDES
NaomiKlein_2010W BECAUSE NONE OF US AT LEAST IN THE GLOBAL NORTH NEITHER MEN NOR WOMEN ARE FULLY EXEMPT FROM THIS MESSAGE
NaomiKlein_2010W THE NARRATIVE OF THE NEWLY DISCOVERED FRONTIER AND THE CONQUERING PIONEER THE NARRATIVE OF MANIFEST DESTINY THE NARRATIVE OF APOCALYPSE AND
NaomiKlein_2010W GOTTEN OVER THEM THEY POP UP IN THE STRANGEST PLACES FOR INSTANCE I STUMBLED ACROSS THIS ADVERTISEMENT OUTSIDE THE WOMEN 'S WASHROOM IN THE KANSAS CITY AIRPORT
NaomiKlein_2010W IT'S FOR MOTOROLA 'S NEW RUGGED CELLPHONE AND YES IT REALLY DOES SAY SLAP MOTHER NATURE IN THE FACE
NaomiKlein_2010W THIS IS A CRASS VERSION OF OUR FOUNDING STORY WE SLAPPED MOTHER NATURE AROUND AND WON AND WE ALWAYS WIN BECAUSE DOMINATING NATURE IS OUR DESTINY
NaomiKlein_2010W FROM TONY HAYWARD AGAIN
NaomiKlein_2010W THE GULF OF MEXICO IS A VERY BIG
NaomiKlein_2010W THE AMOUNT OF OIL AND DISPERSANT THAT WE ARE PUTTING INTO IT IS TINY IN RELATION TO THE TOTAL WATER VOLUME IN OTHER WORDS THE OCEAN IS
NaomiKlein_2010W SHE CAN TAKE
NaomiKlein_2010W IT IS THIS UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION OF LIMITLESSNESS THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO TAKE THE RECKLESS RISKS THAT WE DO
NaomiKlein_2010W BECAUSE THIS IS OUR REAL MASTER NARRATIVE HOWEVER MUCH WE MESS UP THERE WILL ALWAYS BE MORE
NaomiKlein_2010W MORE WATER MORE LAND MORE UNTAPPED RESOURCES A NEW BUBBLE WILL REPLACE THE OLD ONE A NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL COME ALONG TO FIX THE MESSES WE MADE WITH THE LAST ONE
NaomiKlein_2010W IN A WAY THAT IS THE STORY OF THE SETTLING OF THE AMERICAS THE SUPPOSEDLY INEXHAUSTIBLE FRONTIER TO WHICH EUROPEANS ESCAPED
NaomiKlein_2010W NOW THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE STORY WAS ALWAYS A LIE THE EARTH ALWAYS DID HAVE LIMITS THEY WERE JUST BEYOND OUR SIGHTS AND NOW WE ARE HITTING THOSE LIMITS ON MULTIPLE FRONTS
NaomiKlein_2010W I BELIEVE THAT WE KNOW THIS YET WE FIND OURSELVES TRAPPED IN A KIND OF NARRATIVE LOOP
NaomiKlein_2010W NOT ONLY DO WE CONTINUE TO TELL AND RETELL THE SAME TIRED STORIES BUT WE ARE NOW DOING SO WITH A FRENZY AND A FURY THAT FRANKLY VERGES ON CAMP
NaomiKlein_2010W HOW ELSE TO EXPLAIN THE CULTURAL SPACE OCCUPIED BY SARAH PALIN NOW ON THE ONE HAND EXHORTING US TO DRILL BABY DRILL BECAUSE GOD PUT THOSE RESOURCES INTO THE GROUND
NaomiKlein_2010W IN ORDER FOR US TO EXPLOIT THEM AND ON THE OTHER GLORYING IN THE WILDERNESS OF ALASKA 'S UNTOUCHED BEAUTY ON HER HIT REALITY TV SHOW
NaomiKlein_2010W THE TWIN MESSAGE IS AS COMFORTING AS IT IS MAD
NaomiKlein_2010W IGNORE THOSE CREEPING FEARS THAT WE HAVE FINALLY HIT THE WALL THERE ARE STILL NO LIMITS THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ANOTHER FRONTIER SO STOP WORRYING AND KEEP SHOPPING
NaomiKlein_2010W NOW WOULD THAT THIS WERE JUST ABOUT SARAH PALIN AND HER REALITY TV SHOW IN ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCLES WE OFTEN HERE THAT RATHER THAN SHIFTING TO RENEWABLES WE ARE CONTINUING WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL
NaomiKlein_2010W THIS ASSESSMENT UNFORTUNATELY IS FAR TOO OPTIMISTIC
NaomiKlein_2010W THE TRUTH IS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY EXHAUSTED SO MUCH OF THE EASILY ACCESSIBLE FOSSIL FUELS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY ENTERED A FAR RISKIER BUSINESS
NaomiKlein_2010W ERA OF EXTREME ENERGY SO THAT MEANS
NaomiKlein_2010W DRILLING FOR OIL IN THE DEEPEST WATER INCLUDING THE ICY ARCTIC SEAS WHERE A CLEAN UP MAY SIMPLY BE IMPOSSIBLE IT MEANS LARGE SCALE HYDRAULIC FRACKING FOR GAS
NaomiKlein_2010W AND MASSIVE STRIP MINING OPERATIONS FOR COAL THE LIKES OF WHICH WE HAVEN'T YET SEEN AND MOST CONTROVERSIALLY IT MEANS THE TAR SANDS
NaomiKlein_2010W I'M ALWAYS SURPRISED BY HOW LITTLE PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF CANADA KNOW ABOUT THE ALBERTA TAR SANDS WHICH THIS YEAR ARE PROJECTED TO BECOME THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF IMPORTED OIL
NaomiKlein_2010W TO THE UNITED STATES IT'S WORTH TAKING A MOMENT TO UNDERSTAND THIS PRACTICE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT SPEAKS TO RECKLESSNESS AND THE PATH WE'RE ON LIKE LITTLE ELSE
NaomiKlein_2010W THIS IS WHERE THE TAR SANDS LIVE UNDER ONE OF THE LAST MAGNIFICENT BOREAL FORESTS THE OIL IS NOT LIQUID YOU CAN'T JUST DRILL A HOLE AND PUMP IT OUT
NaomiKlein_2010W SO TO GET AT IT YOU FIRST HAVE TO GET RID OF THE TREES
NaomiKlein_2010W THEN YOU RIP OFF THE TOPSOIL AND GET AT THAT OILY SAND
NaomiKlein_2010W THE PROCESS REQUIRES A HUGE AMOUNT OF WATER
NaomiKlein_2010W NOW LOOKING AT THESE IMAGES
NaomiKlein_2010W IT'S DIFFICULT TO GRASP THE SCALE OF THIS OPERATION WHICH CAN ALREADY BE SEEN FROM SPACE AND COULD GROW TO AN AREA THE SIZE OF ENGLAND
NaomiKlein_2010W I FIND IT HELPS ACTUALLY TO LOOK AT THE DUMP TRUCKS THAT MOVE THE EARTH THE LARGEST EVER BUILT THAT'S A PERSON DOWN THERE BY THE WHEEL
NaomiKlein_2010W THIS IS NOT OIL DRILLING IT'S NOT EVEN MINING
NaomiKlein_2010W IT IS TERRESTRIAL SKINNING
NaomiKlein_2010W VAST VIVID LANDSCAPES ARE BEING GUTTED LEFT MONOCHROMATIC GRAY
NaomiKlein_2010W THAT AS I'M CONCERNED THIS WOULD BE AN ABOMINATION IF IT EMITTED NOT ONE PARTICLE OF CARBON
NaomiKlein_2010W BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT ON AVERAGE TURNING THAT GUNK INTO CRUDE OIL
NaomiKlein_2010W HOW ELSE TO DESCRIBE THIS BUT AS A FORM OF MASS INSANITY
NaomiKlein_2010W THIS IS WHERE OUR STORY OF ENDLESS GROWTH HAS TAKEN US TO THIS BLACKHOLE AT THE CENTER OF MY COUNTRY A PLACE OF SUCH PLANETARY PAIN THAT LIKE THE BP GUSHER ONE CAN ONLY STAND TO LOOK AT IT FOR SO LONG
NaomiKlein_2010W AS JARED DIAMOND AND OTHERS HAVE SHOWN US THIS IS HOW CIVILIZATIONS COMMIT SUICIDE BY SLAMMING THEIR FOOT ON THE ACCELERATOR AT THE EXACT MOMENT WHEN THEY SHOULD BE PUTTING ON THE BRAKES
NaomiKlein_2010W THE PROBLEM IS THAT OUR MASTER NARRATIVE HAS AN ANSWER FOR THAT
NaomiKlein_2010W AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE WE ARE GOING TO GET SAVED JUST LIKE IN EVERY HOLLYWOOD MOVIE JUST LIKE IN THE RAPTURE
NaomiKlein_2010W BUT OF COURSE OUR SECULAR RELIGION IS TECHNOLOGY
NaomiKlein_2010W NOW YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED MORE AND MORE HEADLINES LIKE THESE
NaomiKlein_2010W THE IDEA BEHIND THIS FORM OF GEOENGINEERING AS IT'S CALLED IS THAT AS THE PLANET HEATS UP WE MAY BE ABLE TO SHOOT SULFATES AND ALUMINUM PARTICLES
NaomiKlein_2010W INTO THE STRATOSPHERE TO REFLECT SOME OF THE SUN 'S RAYS BACK TO SPACE THEREBY COOLING THE PLANET
NaomiKlein_2010W THE WACKIEST PLAN AND I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP WOULD PUT WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A GARDEN HOSE EIGHTEEN AND A HALF MILES HIGH INTO THE SKY SUSPENDED BY BALLOONS TO SPEW SULFUR DIOXIDE
NaomiKlein_2010W SO SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF POLLUTION WITH MORE POLLUTION
NaomiKlein_2010W OF IT AS THE ULTIMATE JUNK SHOT
NaomiKlein_2010W THE SERIOUS SCIENTISTS INVOLVED IN THIS RESEARCH ALL STRESS THAT THESE TECHNIQUES ARE
NaomiKlein_2010W THE MERE MENTION OF GEOENGINEERING IS BEING GREETED IN SOME CIRCLES PARTICULARLY MEDIA CIRCLES WITH A RELIEF TINGED WITH EUPHORIA
NaomiKlein_2010W AN ESCAPE HATCH HAS BEEN REACHED A NEW FRONTIER HAS BEEN FOUND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE OUR LIFESTYLES AFTER ALL
NaomiKlein_2010W YOU SEE FOR SOME PEOPLE THEIR SAVIOR IS A GUY IN A FLOWING ROBE FOR OTHER PEOPLE IT'S A GUY WITH A GARDEN HOSE
NaomiKlein_2010W WE BADLY NEED SOME NEW STORIES
NaomiKlein_2010W WE NEED STORIES THAT HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF HEROES WILLING TO TAKE DIFFERENT KINDS OF RISKS RISKS THAT CONFRONT RECKLESSNESS HEAD ON THAT PUT THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE INTO PRACTICE
NaomiKlein_2010W EVEN IF THAT MEANS THROUGH DIRECT ACTION LIKE HUNDREDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WILL TO GET ARRESTED BLOCKING DIRTY POWER PLANTS OR FIGHTING MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL COAL
NaomiKlein_2010W WE NEED STORIES THAT REPLACE THAT LINEAR NARRATIVE OF ENDLESS GROWTH WITH CIRCULAR NARRATIVES
NaomiKlein_2010W THAT REMIND US THAT WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND THAT THIS IS OUR ONLY HOME THERE IS NO ESCAPE HATCH CALL IT KARMA
NaomiKlein_2010W CALL IT PHYSICS ACTION AND REACTION CALL IT PRECAUTION THE PRINCIPLE THAT REMINDS US THAT LIFE IS TOO PRECIOUS TO BE RISKED FOR ANY PROFIT THANK YOU
