EthanZuckerman_2010G@16.57:24.61 WHICH MEANS GENERALLY I IGNORE FOOTBALL UNLESS IT INVOLVES GUYS MY SIZE OR BRUNO 'S SIZE RUNNING INTO EACH OTHER AT EXTREMELY HIGH SPEEDS
EthanZuckerman_2010G@25.68:35.06 THAT SAID IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD TO IGNORE FOOTBALL FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS I GO ONTO TWITTER THERE ARE ALL THESE STRANGE WORDS THAT I'VE NEVER HEARD BEFORE FIFA
EthanZuckerman_2010G@36.60:44.61 WEIRD JOKES ABOUT OCTOPI BUT THE ONE THAT'S REALLY BEEN SORT OF STRESSING ME OUT THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT IS THIS PHRASE CALA A BOCA GALVAO
EthanZuckerman_2010G@44.99:56.15 IF YOU'VE GONE ONTO TWITTER IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN THIS IT'S BEEN A MAJOR TRENDING TOPIC BEING A MONOLINGUAL AMERICAN I OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PHRASE MEANS SO I WENT ONTO TWITTER AND I ASKED SOME PEOPLE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@56.41:62.13 IF THEY COULD EXPLAIN TO ME CALA A BOCA GALVAO AND FORTUNATELY MY BRAZILIAN FRIENDS WERE MORE THAN READY TO HELP
EthanZuckerman_2010G@62.50:70.81 THEY EXPLAINED THAT THE GALVAO BIRD IS A RARE AND ENDANGERED PARROT THAT'S IN TERRIBLE TERRIBLE DANGER IN FACT I'LL LET THEM TELL YOU A BIT MORE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@76.29:81.08 EVERY YEAR MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND GALVAO BIRDS ARE KILLED DURING CARNIVAL PARADES
EthanZuckerman_2010G@93.79:102.00 WHICH MEANS THAT THERE'S A TERRIBLE PROBLEM WITH GALVAO ABUSE SOME SICK AND TWISTED PEOPLE HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES SNORTING GALVAO AND IT'S TERRIBLY ENDANGERED
EthanZuckerman_2010G@102.29:110.36 THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT THIS IS THAT THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY AGAIN MY BRAZILIAN FRIENDS TELL ME IS PITCHING IN TO HELP OUT IT TURNS OUT THAT LADY GAGA
EthanZuckerman_2010G@110.71:116.95 HAS RELEASED A NEW SINGLE ACTUALLY FIVE OR SIX NEW SINGLES AS NEAR AS I CAN TELL TITLED CALA A BOCA GALVAO
EthanZuckerman_2010G@140.93:149.40 WHO 'S THE LEAD SOCCER COMMENTATOR FOR REDE GLOBO AND WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM MY BRAZILIAN FRIENDS IS THAT THIS GUY IS JUST A CLICHE MACHINE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@149.70:159.16 HE CAN RUIN THE MOST INTERESTING MATCH BY JUST SPOUTING CLICHE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN SO BRAZILIANS WENT TO THAT FIRST MATCH AGAINST NORTH KOREA PUT UP THIS BANNER
EthanZuckerman_2010G@170.40:178.95 THERE'S A COUPLE THERE'S A COUPLE OF LESSONS THAT YOU CAN TAKE FROM THIS AND THE FIRST LESSON WHICH I THINK IS A WORTHWHILE ONE IS THAT YOU CANNOT GO WRONG
EthanZuckerman_2010G@179.45:192.21 ASKING PEOPLE TO BE ACTIVE ONLINE SO LONG AS ACTIVISM JUST MEANS RETWEETING A PHRASE SO AS LONG AS ACTIVISM IS THAT SIMPLE IT'S PRETTY EASY TO GET AWAY WITH THE OTHER THING YOU CAN TAKE FROM THIS BY THE WAY IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT
EthanZuckerman_2010G@193.02:201.93 ON TWITTER THERE'S MORE THAN FIVE MILLION OF THEM AS FAR AS NATIONAL REPRESENTATION ELEVEN PERCENT OF BRAZILIAN INTERNET USERS ARE ON TWITTER THAT'S A MUCH HIGHER NUMBER
EthanZuckerman_2010G@202.26:207.98 THAN IN THE U S OR U K NEXT TO JAPAN IT'S THE SECOND MOST REPRESENTED BY POPULATION
EthanZuckerman_2010G@208.35:221.92 NOW IF YOU'RE USING TWITTER OR OTHER SOCIAL NETWORKS AND YOU DIDN'T REALIZE THIS WAS A SPACE WITH A LOT OF BRAZILIANS IN IT YOU'RE LIKE MOST OF US BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS ON A SOCIAL NETWORK IS YOU INTERACT WITH THE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO INTERACT WITH
EthanZuckerman_2010G@222.23:232.70 AND IF YOU ARE LIKE ME A BIG GEEKY WHITE AMERICAN GUY YOU TEND TO INTERACT WITH A LOT OF OTHER GEEKY WHITE AMERICAN GUYS AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE SENSE THAT TWITTER IS IN FACT A VERY HEAVILY BRAZILIAN SPACE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@233.12:244.06 IT'S ALSO EXTREMELY SURPRISING TO MANY AMERICANS A HEAVILY AFRICAN AMERICAN SPACE TWITTER RECENTLY DID SOME RESEARCH THEY LOOKED AT THEIR LOCAL POPULATION THEY BELIEVE THAT TWENTY FOUR PERCENT
EthanZuckerman_2010G@244.27:249.85 OF AMERICAN TWITTER USERS ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN THAT'S ABOUT TWICE AS HIGH AS AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE REPRESENTED IN THE POPULATION
EthanZuckerman_2010G@250.21:263.94 AND AGAIN THAT WAS VERY SHOCKING TO MANY TWITTER USERS BUT IT SHOULDN 'T BE AND THE REASON IT SHOULDN 'T BE IS THAT ON ANY DAY YOU CAN GO INTO TRENDING TOPICS AND YOU TEND TO FIND TOPICS THAT ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY AFRICAN AMERICAN CONVERSATIONS
EthanZuckerman_2010G@274.29:284.55 AND ESSENTIALLY FOUND THAT A LOT OF THESE TRENDING TOPICS WERE BASICALLY SEGREGATED CONVERSATIONS AND IN WAYS THAT YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT IT TURNS OUT THAT OIL SPILL IS A MOSTLY WHITE CONVERSATION
EthanZuckerman_2010G@284.90:295.52 THAT COOKOUT IS A MOSTLY BLACK CONVERSATION AND WHAT'S CRAZY ABOUT THIS IS THAT IF YOU WANTED TO MIX UP WHO YOU WERE SEEING ON TWITTER IT'S LITERALLY A QUICK CLICK AWAY
EthanZuckerman_2010G@296.01:306.55 YOU CLICK ON THAT COOKOUT TAG THERE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CONVERSATION WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN IT BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING MOST OF US DON 'T WE END UP WITHIN THESE FILTER BUBBLES AS MY FRIEND ELI PARISER CALLS THEM
EthanZuckerman_2010G@306.88:314.78 WHERE WE SEE THE PEOPLE WE ALREADY KNOW AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SIMILAR TO THE PEOPLE WE ALREADY KNOW AND WE TEND NOT TO SEE THAT WIDER PICTURE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@315.24:327.27 NOW FOR ME I'M SURPRISED BY THIS BECAUSE THIS WASN'T HOW THE INTERNET WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IF YOU GO BACK INTO THE EARLY DAYS OF THE INTERNET WHEN CYBER UTOPIANS LIKE NICK NEGROPONTE WERE WRITING BIG BOOKS LIKE BEING DIGITAL
EthanZuckerman_2010G@327.66:336.77 THE PREDICTION WAS THAT THE INTERNET WAS GOING TO BE AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL FORCE TO SMOOTH OUT CULTURAL DIFFERENCES TO PUT US ALL ON A COMMON FIELD OF ONE FASHION OR ANOTHER
EthanZuckerman_2010G@344.27:352.50 HE 'S AT A TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE IN FLORIDA AND HE 'S LOOKING AT SOMETHING REALLY TRULY ABSURD WHICH IS BOTTLES OF EVIAN WATER ON THE TABLE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@370.42:378.92 NOW NEGROPONTE HAS BEEN RIGHT ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS HE 'S TOTALLY WRONG ABOUT THIS ONE IT TURNS OUT THAT IN MANY CASES ATOMS ARE MUCH MORE MOBILE THAN BITS
EthanZuckerman_2010G@379.28:393.23 IF I WALK INTO A STORE IN THE UNITED STATES IT'S VERY VERY EASY FOR ME TO BUY WATER THAT'S BOTTLED IN FIJI SHIPPED AT GREAT EXPENSE TO THE UNITED STATES IT'S ACTUALLY SURPRISINGLY HARD FOR ME TO SEE A FIJIAN FEATURE FILM
EthanZuckerman_2010G@393.58:400.43 IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO LISTEN TO FIJIAN MUSIC IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GET FIJIAN NEWS WHICH IS STRANGE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@410.86:424.22 HERE 'S WHAT I THINK IS GOING ON I THINK THAT WE TEND TO LOOK A LOT AT THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF GLOBALIZATION WE LOOK AT THE FRAMEWORK THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO LIVE IN THIS CONNECTED WORLD AND THAT'S A FRAMEWORK THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@424.85:434.53 AIRLINE ROUTES IT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE THE INTERNET CABLE WE LOOK AT A MAP LIKE THIS ONE AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE ENTIRE WORLD IS FLAT BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS A HOP OR TWO AWAY
EthanZuckerman_2010G@435.00:448.27 YOU CAN GET ON A FLIGHT IN LONDON YOU CAN END UP IN BANGALORE LATER TODAY TWO HOPS YOU'RE IN SUVA THE CAPITOL OF FIJI IT'S ALL RIGHT THERE WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT WHAT ACTUALLY FLOWS ON TOP OF THESE NETWORKS YOU GET A VERY DIFFERENT PICTURE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@448.72:462.62 YOU START LOOKING AT HOW THE GLOBAL PLANE FLIGHTS MOVE AND YOU SUDDENLY DISCOVER THAT THE WORLD ISN'T EVEN CLOSE TO FLAT IT'S EXTREMELY LUMPY THERE ARE PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT ARE VERY VERY WELL CONNECTED THERE'S BASICALLY A GIANT PATHWAY IN THE SKY BETWEEN LONDON AND NEW YORK
EthanZuckerman_2010G@463.05:474.46 BUT LOOK AT THIS MAP AND YOU CAN WATCH THIS FOR YOU KNOW TWO OR THREE MINUTES YOU WON 'T SEE VERY MANY PLANES GO FROM SOUTH AMERICA TO AFRICA AND YOU'LL DISCOVER THAT THERE ARE PARTS OF THE GLOBE THAT ARE SYSTEMATICALLY CUT OFF
EthanZuckerman_2010G@474.80:488.54 WHEN WE STOP LOOKING AT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MAKES CONNECTION POSSIBLE AND WE LOOK AT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WE START REALIZING THAT THE WORLD DOESN'T WORK QUITE THE SAME WAY THAT WE THINK IT DOES SO HERE 'S THE PROBLEM THAT I'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN IN THE LAST DECADE OR SO
EthanZuckerman_2010G@489.12:498.86 THE WORLD IS IN FACT GETTING MORE GLOBAL IT'S GETTING MORE CONNECTED MORE OF PROBLEMS ARE GLOBAL IN SCALE MORE OF OUR ECONOMICS IS GLOBAL IN SCALE AND OUR MEDIA IS LESS GLOBAL BY
EthanZuckerman_2010G@500.09:511.00 IF YOU WATCHED A TELEVISION BROADCAST IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY PERCENT OF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERNATIONAL NEWS ON A NIGHTLY NEW BROADCAST THAT'S DOWN TO ABOUT TWELVE TO FIFTEEN PERCENT
EthanZuckerman_2010G@520.06:529.09 AND SHE MADE A CARTOGRAM WHICH IS BASICALLY A DISTORTED MAP BASED ON WHAT AMERICAN TELEVISION NEWS CASTS LOOKED AT FOR A MONTH
EthanZuckerman_2010G@529.43:543.08 AND YOU SEE THAT WHEN YOU DISTORT A MAP BASED ON ATTENTION THE WORLD WITHIN AMERICAN TELEVISION NEWS IS BASICALLY REDUCED TO THIS GIANT BLOATED U S AND A COUPLE OF OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH WE'VE INVADED AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT OUR MEDIA IS ABOUT
EthanZuckerman_2010G@543.41:552.79 AND BEFORE YOU CONCLUDE THAT THIS IS JUST A FUNCTION OF AMERICAN TV NEWS WHICH IS DREADFUL AND I AGREE THAT IT'S DREADFUL I'VE BEEN MAPPING ELITE MEDIA LIKE THE NEW YORK TIMES AND I GET THE SAME THING
EthanZuckerman_2010G@553.17:562.06 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NEW YORK TIMES YOU LOOK AT OTHER ELITE MEDIA WHAT YOU LARGELY GET ARE PICTURES OF VERY WEALTHY NATIONS AND THE NATIONS WE'VE INVADED IT TURNS OUT THAT NEW MEDIA
EthanZuckerman_2010G@562.39:572.61 ISN'T NECESSARILY HELPING US ALL THAT MUCH HERE 'S A MAP MADE BY MARK GRAHAM WHO 'S DOWN THE STREET AT THE OXFORD INTERNET INSTITUTE A THIS IS A MAP OF ARTICLES IN WIKIPEDIA THAT HAVE BEEN GEO CODED
EthanZuckerman_2010G@587.53:594.61 IN THE U K YOU CAN GET UP YOU CAN PICK UP YOUR COMPUTER WHEN YOU GET OUT OF THIS SESSION YOU COULD READ A NEWSPAPER FROM INDIA OR FROM AUSTRALIA FROM CANADA
EthanZuckerman_2010G@594.90:602.75 GOD FORBID FROM THE U S YOU PROBABLY WON 'T IF YOU LOOK AT ONLINE MEDIA CONSUMPTION IN THIS CASE IN THE TOP TEN USERS OF THE INTERNET
EthanZuckerman_2010G@603.15:613.87 MORE THAN NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE NEWS READERSHIP IS ON DOMESTIC NEWS SITES IT'S ONE OF THESE RARE CASES WHERE THE U S IS ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY LIKE READING YOUR MEDIA RATHER THAN VICE VERSA
EthanZuckerman_2010G@614.35:620.28 SO ALL OF THIS STARTS LEADING ME TO THINK THAT WE'RE IN A STATE THAT I REFER TO AS IMAGINARY COSMOPOLITANISM
EthanZuckerman_2010G@620.78:628.51 WE LOOK AT THE INTERNET WE THINK WE'RE GETTING THIS WIDE VIEW OF THE GLOBE WE OCCASIONALLY STUMBLE ONTO A PAGE IN CHINESE AND WE DECIDE THAT
EthanZuckerman_2010G@628.77:636.56 WE DO IN FACT HAVE THE GREATEST TECHNOLOGY EVER BUILT TO CONNECT US TO THE REST OF THE WORLD AND WE FORGET THAT MOST OF THE TIME WE'RE CHECKING BOSTON RED SOX SCORES
EthanZuckerman_2010G@646.54:658.71 THE REAL PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD THE INTERESTING PROBLEMS TO SOLVE ARE GLOBAL IN SCALE AND SCOPE THEY REQUIRE GLOBAL CONVERSATIONS TO GET TO GLOBAL SOLUTIONS THIS IS A PROBLEM WE HAVE TO SOLVE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@659.35:673.28 SO HERE 'S THE GOOD NEWS FOR SIX YEARS I'VE BEEN HANGING OUT WITH THESE GUYS THIS IS A GROUP CALLED GLOBAL VOICES THIS IS A TEAM OF BLOGGERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD OUR MISSION WAS TO FIX THE WORLD 'S MEDIA WE STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED WE HAVEN'T DONE ALL THAT WELL SO FAR
EthanZuckerman_2010G@673.92:688.38 NOR DO I THINK WE ARE BY OURSELVES ACTUALLY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT THE MORE THAT I THINK ABOUT IT THE MORE THAT I THINK THAT A FEW THINGS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED ALONG THE WAY ARE INTERESTING LESSONS FOR HOW WE WOULD REWIRE IF WE WE WANTED TO USE THE WEB TO HAVE A WIDER WORLD
EthanZuckerman_2010G@688.79:700.44 THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER IS THAT THERE ARE PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT ARE DARK SPOTS IN TERMS OF ATTENTION IN THIS CASE THE MAP OF THE WORLD AT NIGHT BY NASA THEY'RE DARK LITERALLY BECAUSE OF LACK OF ELECTRICITY
EthanZuckerman_2010G@700.71:713.11 AND I USED TO THINK THAT A DARK SPOT ON THIS MAP BASICALLY MEANT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET MEDIA FROM THERE BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE BASIC NEEDS WHAT I'M STARTING TO REALIZE IS THAT YOU CAN GET MEDIA IT'S JUST AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK AND YOU NEED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ENCOURAGEMENT
EthanZuckerman_2010G@721.56:731.33 WHO LIVE THERE AND SO THE PEOPLE WHO FOUNDED FOKO CLUB IN MADAGASCAR WEREN'T ACTUALLY CONCERNED WITH TRYING TO CHANGE THE IMAGE OF THEIR COUNTRY THEY WERE DOING SOMETHING MUCH SIMPLER
EthanZuckerman_2010G@731.72:742.09 IT WAS A CLUB TO LEARN ENGLISH AND TO LEARN COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT MADAGASCAR WENT THROUGH A VIOLENT COUP MOST INDEPENDENT MEDIA WAS SHUT DOWN
EthanZuckerman_2010G@742.40:753.05 AND THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO WERE LEARNING TO BLOG THROUGH FOKO CLUB SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES TALKING TO AN INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE ABOUT THE DEMONSTRATIONS THE VIOLENCE EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON WITHIN THIS COUNTRY
EthanZuckerman_2010G@753.48:765.40 SO A VERY VERY SMALL PROGRAM DESIGNED TO GET PEOPLE IN FRONT OF COMPUTERS PUBLISHING THEIR OWN THOUGHTS PUBLISHING INDEPENDENT MEDIA ENDED UP HAVING A HUGE IMPACT ON WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS COUNTRY
EthanZuckerman_2010G@765.70:775.91 NOW THE TRICK WITH THIS IS THAT I'M GUESSING MOST PEOPLE HERE DON'T SPEAK MALAGASY I'M ALSO GUESSING THAT MOST OF YOU DON'T EVEN SPEAK CHINESE WHICH IS SORT OF SAD IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT AS IT'S NOW THE MOST REPRESENTED LANGUAGE ON THE INTERNET
EthanZuckerman_2010G@785.55:795.08 WHICH AUTOMATICALLY DETECTS THAT THE PAGE IS IN CHINESE AND VERY QUICKLY AT A MOUSE CLICK WILL GIVE YOU A TRANSLATION OF THE PAGE UNFORTUNATELY IT'S A MACHINE TRANSLATION OF THE PAGE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@795.40:806.80 AND WHILE GOOGLE IS VERY VERY GOOD WITH SOME LANGUAGES IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY DREADFUL WITH CHINESE AND THE RESULTS CAN BE PRETTY FUNNY WHAT YOU REALLY WANT WHAT I REALLY WANT IS EVENTUALLY THE ABILITY TO PUSH A BUTTON
EthanZuckerman_2010G@807.01:814.74 AND HAVE THIS QUEUED SO A HUMAN BEING CAN TRANSLATE THIS AND IF YOU THINK THIS IS ABSURD IT'S NOT THERE'S A GROUP RIGHT NOW IN CHINA CALLED
EthanZuckerman_2010G@815.66:824.55 AND YEEYAN IS A GROUP OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS WHO GET ONLINE EVERY DAY THEY LOOK FOR THE MOST INTERESTING CONTENT IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@824.82:830.95 THEY TRANSLATE ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED ARTICLES A DAY FROM MAJOR NEWSPAPERS MAJOR WEBSITES THEY PUT IT ONLINE FOR FREE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@831.23:836.64 IT'S THE PROJECT OF A GUY NAMED ZHANG LEI WHO WAS LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES DURING THE LHASA RIOTS
EthanZuckerman_2010G@836.89:846.86 AND WHO COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW BIASED AMERICAN MEDIA COVERAGE WAS AND HE SAID IF THERE'S ONE THING I CAN DO I CAN START TRANSLATING SO THAT PEOPLE BETWEEN THESE COUNTRIES START UNDERSTANDING EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT BETTER
EthanZuckerman_2010G@847.22:855.23 AND MY QUESTION TO YOU IS IN YEEYAN CAN LINE UP ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE TO TRANSLATE THE ENGLISH INTERNET INTO CHINESE WHERE'S THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@864.85:873.88 SO EVEN IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO TRANSLATE FROM CHINESE THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND IT WHEN WE LOOK FOR INFORMATION ONLINE WE BASICALLY HAVE TWO STRATEGIES
EthanZuckerman_2010G@874.99:885.17 A LOT OF SEARCH AND SEARCH IS TERRIFIC IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT IF WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS SERENDIPITY IF YOU WANT TO STUMBLE ONTO SOMETHING THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU NEEDED
EthanZuckerman_2010G@885.66:896.62 OUR MAIN PHILOSOPHY IS TO LOOK TO OUR SOCIAL NETWORKS TO LOOK FOR OUR FRIENDS WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING AT MAYBE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IT THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU END UP GETTING AFTER A WHILE IS THE WISDOM OF THE FLOCK
EthanZuckerman_2010G@897.02:903.72 YOU END UP FLOCKING WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PROBABLY SIMILAR TO YOU WHO HAVE SIMILAR INTERESTS AND IT'S VERY VERY HARD
EthanZuckerman_2010G@903.97:916.17 TO GET INFORMATION FROM THE OTHER FLOCKS FROM THE OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE PEOPLE GETTING TOGETHER AND TALKING ABOUT THEIR OWN INTERESTS TO DO THIS AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU NEED SOMEONE TO BUMP YOU OUT OF YOUR FLOCK AND INTO ANOTHER FLOCK YOU NEED A
EthanZuckerman_2010G@917.13:922.59 SO THIS IS AMIRA AL HUSSAINI SHE IS THE MIDDLE EAST EDITOR FOR GLOBAL VOICES SHE HAS ONE OF THE HARDEST JOBS IN THE WORLD
EthanZuckerman_2010G@922.96:931.64 NOT ONLY DOES SHE HAVE TO KEEP OUR ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN CONTRIBUTORS FROM KILLING EACH OTHER SHE HAS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING TO INTEREST YOU ABOUT THE MIDDLE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@932.29:941.96 AND IN THAT SENSE OF TRYING TO GET YOU OUT OF YOUR NORMAL ORBIT AND TO TRY TO GET YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO A STORY ABOUT SOMEONE WHO 'S GIVEN UP SMOKING FOR THE MONTH OF RAMADAN
EthanZuckerman_2010G@942.39:949.14 SHE HAS TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT A GLOBAL AUDIENCE SHE HAS TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT STORIES ARE AVAILABLE BASICALLY SHE'S A DEEJAY
EthanZuckerman_2010G@949.53:959.04 SHE'S A SKILLED HUMAN CURATOR WHO KNOWS WHAT MATERIAL IS AVAILABLE TO HER WHO 'S ABLE TO LISTEN TO THE AUDIENCE AND WHO 'S ABLE TO MAKE A SELECTION AND PUSH PEOPLE FORWARD IN ONE FASHION OR ANOTHER
EthanZuckerman_2010G@959.49:968.71 I DON'T THINK THIS IS NECESSARILY AN ALGORITHMIC PROCESS I THINK WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THE INTERNET IS THAT IT ACTUALLY MAKES IT MUCH EASIER FOR DEEJAYS TO REACH A WIDER AUDIENCE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@969.02:980.38 I KNOW AMIRA I CAN ASK HER WHAT TO READ BUT WITH THE INTERNET SHE'S IN A POSITION WHERE SHE CAN TELL A LOT OF PEOPLE WHAT TO READ AND YOU CAN LISTEN TO HER AS WELL IF THIS IS A WAY THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN HAVING YOUR WEB
EthanZuckerman_2010G@981.45:995.12 SO ONCE YOU START WIDENING LIKE THIS ONCE YOU START LIGHTING UP VOICES IN THE DARK SPOTS ONCE YOU START TRANSLATING ONCE YOU START CURATING YOU END UP IN SOME REALLY WEIRD PLACES THIS IS AN IMAGE FROM PRETTY MUCH MY FAVORITE BLOG WHICH IS AFRIGADGET
EthanZuckerman_2010G@995.41:1007.98 AND AFRIGADGET IS A BLOG THAT LOOKS AT TECHNOLOGY IN AN AFRICA CONTEXT AND SPECIFICALLY IT'S LOOKING AT A BLACKSMITH IN KIBERA IN NAIROBI WHO IS TURNING THE SHAFT OF A LANDROVER INTO A COLD CHISEL
EthanZuckerman_2010G@1008.41:1020.91 AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS IMAGE YOU MIGHT FIND YOURSELF GOING WHY WOULD I CONCEIVABLY CARE ABOUT THIS AND THE TRUTH IS THIS GUY CAN PROBABLY EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU THIS IS ERIK HERSMAN YOU GUYS MAY HAVE SEEN HIM AROUND THE CONFERENCE HE GOES BY THE MONIKER WHITE AFRICAN
EthanZuckerman_2010G@1021.41:1028.81 HE 'S BOTH A VERY WELL KNOWN AMERICAN GEEK BUT HE 'S ALSO KENYAN HE WAS BORN IN SUDAN GREW UP IN KENYA HE IS A BRIDGE FIGURE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@1029.15:1038.94 HE IS SOMEONE WHO LITERALLY HAS FEET IN BOTH WORLDS ONE IN THE WORLD OF THE AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY COMMUNITY ONE IN THE WORLD OF THE AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY COMMUNITY AND SO HE 'S ABLE TO TELL A STORY
EthanZuckerman_2010G@1046.44:1056.48 ABOUT LOOKING FOR INSPIRATION BASED ON REUSING MATERIALS HE KNOWS ONE WORLD AND HE 'S FINDING A WAY TO COMMUNICATE IT TO ANOTHER WORLD BOTH OF WHICH HE HAS DEEP CONNECTIONS
EthanZuckerman_2010G@1057.25:1070.60 THESE BRIDGE FIGURES I'M PRETTY WELL CONVINCED ARE THE FUTURE OF HOW WE TRY TO MAKE THE WORLD WIDER THROUGH USING THE WEB BUT THE TRICK WITH BRIDGES IS ULTIMATELY YOU NEED SOMEONE TO CROSS THEM AND THAT'S WHERE WE START TALKING ABOUT XENOPHILES
EthanZuckerman_2010G@1071.09:1080.17 SO IF I FOUND MYSELF IN THE NFL I SUSPECT I WOULD SPEND MY OFF SEASON NURSING MY WOUNDS ENJOYING MY HOUSE SO ON AND SO FORTH POSSIBLY RECORDING A HIP HOP ALBUM
EthanZuckerman_2010G@1081.42:1087.77 JONES WHO IS THE MIDDLE LINEBACKER FOR THE CINCINNATI BENGALS HAS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE OFF SEASON
EthanZuckerman_2010G@1088.80:1101.71 HAS A TELEVISION SHOW IT'S CALLED DHANI TACKLES THE GLOBE AND EVERY WEEK ON THIS TELEVISION SHOW DHANI TRAVELS TO A DIFFERENT NATION OF THE WORLD HE FINDS A LOCAL SPORTING TEAM HE TRAINS WITH THEM FOR A WEEK AND HE PLAYS A MATCH WITH
EthanZuckerman_2010G@1102.60:1115.80 AND HIS REASON FOR THIS IS NOT JUST THAT HE WANTS TO MASTER MUAY THAI BOXING IT'S BECAUSE FOR HIM SPORT IS THE LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS HIM TO ENCOUNTER THE FULL WIDTH AND WONDER OF THE WORLD
EthanZuckerman_2010G@1116.15:1128.24 FOR SOME OF US IT MIGHT BE MUSIC FOR SOME OF US IT MIGHT BE FOOD FOR A LOT OF US IT MIGHT BE LITERATURE OR WRITING BUT THERE ARE ALL THESE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES THAT ALLOW YOU TO GO OUT AND LOOK AT THE WORLD AND FIND YOUR PLACE WITHIN IT
EthanZuckerman_2010G@1128.65:1141.84 THE GOAL OF MY TALK HERE IS NOT TO PERSUADE THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM TO EMBRACE YOUR XENOPHILIA MY GUESS GIVEN THAT YOU'RE AT A CONFERENCE CALLED TEDGLOBAL IS THAT MOST OF YOU ARE XENOPHILES WHETHER OR NOT YOU USE THAT TERM
EthanZuckerman_2010G@1142.19:1148.82 MY CHALLENGE INSTEAD IS THIS IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE THE PERSONAL DECISION THAT YOU WANT A WIDER WORLD
EthanZuckerman_2010G@1149.23:1160.33 WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REWIRE THE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE TO FIX OUR MEDIA WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET WE HAVE TO FIX OUR EDUCATION WE HAVE TO FIX OUR IMMIGRATION POLICY
EthanZuckerman_2010G@1160.65:1166.07 WE NEED TO LOOK AT WAYS OF CREATING SERENDIPITY OF MAKING TRANSLATION PERVASIVE
EthanZuckerman_2010G@1166.33:1175.68 WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO EMBRACE AND CELEBRATE THESE BRIDGE FIGURES AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CULTIVATE XENOPHILES THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO I NEED YOUR HELP
