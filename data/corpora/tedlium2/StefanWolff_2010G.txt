StefanWolff_2010G TODAY I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT ETHNIC CONFLICT AND CIVIL WAR THESE ARE NOT NORMALLY THE MOST CHEERFUL OF TOPICS NOR DO THEY GENERALLY GENERATE THE KIND OF GOOD NEWS THAT THIS CONFERENCE IS ABOUT
StefanWolff_2010G NOT ONLY IS THERE AT LEAST SOME GOOD NEWS TO BE TOLD ABOUT FEWER SUCH CONFLICTS NOW THAN TWO DECADES AGO BUT WHAT IS PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT IS THAT WE ALSO HAVE COME TO A MUCH BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT CAN BE DONE
StefanWolff_2010G TO FURTHER REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ETHNIC CONFLICTS AND CIVIL WARS
StefanWolff_2010G AND THE SUFFERING THAT THEY INFLICT
StefanWolff_2010G THREE THINGS STAND OUT
StefanWolff_2010G IN THE RIGHT WAYS THAT IS
StefanWolff_2010G HOW ALL OF US CAN CONTRIBUTE TO DEVELOPING AND HONING THE SKILLS
StefanWolff_2010G OF LOCAL AND GLOBAL LEADERS
StefanWolff_2010G TO MAKE PEACE
StefanWolff_2010G AND TO MAKE IT LAST BUT LET 'S START AT THE BEGINNING CIVIL WARS HAVE MADE NEWS HEADLINES FOR MANY DECADES NOW AND ETHNIC CONFLICTS IN PARTICULAR
StefanWolff_2010G BEEN A NEAR CONSTANT PRESENCE AS A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITY
StefanWolff_2010G FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES NOW
StefanWolff_2010G THE NEWS HAS BEEN
StefanWolff_2010G AND THE IMAGES HAVE BEEN HAUNTING
StefanWolff_2010G IN GEORGIA AFTER YEARS OF STALEMATE WE SAW A FULL SCALE RESURGENCE OF VIOLENCE IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
StefanWolff_2010G THIS QUICKLY ESCALATED INTO A FIVE DAY WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND GEORGIA LEAVING GEORGIA
StefanWolff_2010G A DECADES LONG CIVIL WAR
StefanWolff_2010G BETWEEN THE TAMIL MINORITY AND THE SINHALA MAJORITY LED TO A BLOODY CLIMAX IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE
StefanWolff_2010G IN KYRGYZSTAN JUST OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF VIOLENCE OCCURRED BETWEEN ETHNIC KYRGYZ AND ETHNIC UZBEKS
StefanWolff_2010G HUNDREDS HAVE BEEN KILLED
StefanWolff_2010G AND MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DISPLACED INCLUDING MANY ETHNIC
StefanWolff_2010G WHO FLED TO NEIGHBORING UZBEKISTAN
StefanWolff_2010G IN THE MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS CONTINUES UNABATED
StefanWolff_2010G AND IT BECOMES EVER MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW
StefanWolff_2010G A POSSIBLE SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION CAN BE ACHIEVED
StefanWolff_2010G MAY HAVE SLIPPED FROM THE NEWS HEADLINES BUT THE KILLING AND DISPLACEMENT THERE CONTINUES AS WELL
StefanWolff_2010G AND THE SHEER HUMAN MISERY THAT IT CREATES IS VERY HARD TO FATHOM
StefanWolff_2010G AND IN IRAQ FINALLY VIOLENCE IS ON THE RISE AGAIN
StefanWolff_2010G AND THE COUNTRY HAS YET TO FORM A GOVERNMENT FOUR MONTHS AFTER ITS LAST PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS
StefanWolff_2010G BUT HANG ON THIS TALK IS TO BE ABOUT THE GOOD NEWS SO ARE THESE NOW THE IMAGES OF THE PAST WELL
StefanWolff_2010G THERE IS A LONGER TERM TREND THAT DOES REPRESENT SOME GOOD NEWS
StefanWolff_2010G OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR THERE HAS BEEN AN OVERALL DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF CIVIL WARS
StefanWolff_2010G SINCE THE HIGH IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES WITH ABOUT FIFTY SUCH CIVIL WARS ONGOING WE NOW HAVE THIRTY PERCENT FEWER SUCH CONFLICTS TODAY
StefanWolff_2010G THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED IN CIVIL WARS
StefanWolff_2010G IS MUCH LOWER TODAY THAN IT WAS A DECADE AGO
StefanWolff_2010G LOWEST NUMBER OF COMBATANT CASUALTIES OCCURRED IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE
StefanWolff_2010G JUST TWENTY THOUSAND KILLED
StefanWolff_2010G DESPITE THE UP AND DOWN SINCE THEN
StefanWolff_2010G THE OVERALL TREND AND THIS IS THE IMPORTANT
StefanWolff_2010G CLEARLY POINTS DOWNWARD FOR THE PAST TWO DECADES THE NEWS ABOUT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IS ALSO LESS BAD THAN IT USED TO BE
StefanWolff_2010G A DECADE LATER THIS FIGURE STANDS AT FOUR THOUSAND
StefanWolff_2010G BUT THEN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND CIVILIANS WERE SLAUGHTERED IN A MATTER OF JUST A FEW MONTHS
StefanWolff_2010G THIS CERTAINLY IS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT MUST NEVER BE SURPASSED
StefanWolff_2010G FROM HUNGER OR DISEASE FOR EXAMPLE AND THEY ALSO DO NOT PROPERLY ACCOUNT FOR CIVILIAN SUFFERING MORE GENERALLY
StefanWolff_2010G RAPE AND ETHNIC CLEANSING HAVE BECOME HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IF OFTEN NON LETHAL WEAPONS IN CIVIL WAR
StefanWolff_2010G TO PUT IT DIFFERENTLY
StefanWolff_2010G FOR THE CIVILIANS THAT SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF ETHNIC CONFLICT AND CIVIL WAR
StefanWolff_2010G THERE IS NO GOOD WAR
StefanWolff_2010G AND THERE IS NO BAD PEACE
StefanWolff_2010G THUS EVEN THOUGH EVERY CIVILIAN KILLED MAIMED RAPED OR TORTURED IS ONE TOO MANY THE FACT THAT THE NUMBER OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES
StefanWolff_2010G IS CLEARLY LOWER TODAY THAN IT WAS A DECADE AGO IS GOOD NEWS
StefanWolff_2010G WE HAVE FEWER CONFLICTS TODAY IN WHICH FEWER PEOPLE GET KILLED
StefanWolff_2010G AND THE BIG QUESTION OF COURSE IS WHY
StefanWolff_2010G IN SOME CASES THERE IS A MILITARY VICTORY OF ONE SIDE
StefanWolff_2010G THIS IS A SOLUTION OF SORTS BUT RARELY IS IT ONE THAT COMES WITHOUT HUMAN COSTS OR HUMANITARIAN CONSEQUENCES
StefanWolff_2010G THE DEFEAT OF THE TAMIL TIGERS IN SRI LANKA IS PERHAPS THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE OF THIS
StefanWolff_2010G BUT WE HAVE SEEN SIMILAR SO CALLED MILITARY SOLUTIONS
StefanWolff_2010G THEY ARE COMPLIMENTED BY NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENTS OR AT LEAST CEASE FIRE AGREEMENTS AND PEACEKEEPERS ARE DEPLOYED BUT HARDLY EVER DO THEY REPRESENT A RESOUNDING SUCCESS
StefanWolff_2010G THE CEASE FIRE ON TUESDAY NIGHT
StefanWolff_2010G WAS REACHED JUST IN TIME FOR THE GENOCIDE
StefanWolff_2010G TO START ON WEDNESDAY MORNING
StefanWolff_2010G BUT LET 'S LOOK AT THE GOOD NEWS AGAIN
StefanWolff_2010G IF THERE'S NO SOLUTION ON THE BATTLEFIELD THREE FACTORS CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE PREVENTION OF ETHNIC CONFLICT AND CIVIL WAR OR FOR SUSTAINABLE PEACE
StefanWolff_2010G AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN
StefanWolff_2010G TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND
StefanWolff_2010G THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE KILLED
StefanWolff_2010G NINETY EIGHT SAW THE
StefanWolff_2010G WAS SKILLFULLY MEDIATED BY SENATOR GEORGE MITCHELL
StefanWolff_2010G HE IMPOSED VERY CLEAR CONDITIONS FOR THE PARTICIPATION AND NEGOTIATIONS
StefanWolff_2010G CENTRAL AMONG THEM A COMMITMENT TO EXCLUSIVELY PEACEFUL MEANS
StefanWolff_2010G INNOVATIVE AND ALLOWED ALL CONFLICT PARTIES TO SEE THEIR CORE CONCERNS AND DEMANDS ADDRESSED
StefanWolff_2010G THE AGREEMENT COMBINES A POWER SHARING ARRANGEMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND
StefanWolff_2010G WITH CROSS BORDER INSTITUTIONS THAT LINK BELFAST AND DUBLIN
StefanWolff_2010G AND THUS RECOGNIZE THE SO CALLED IRISH DIMENSION OF THE CONFLICT
StefanWolff_2010G AND SIGNIFICANTLY THERE'S ALSO A CLEAR FOCUS ON BOTH
StefanWolff_2010G THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS AND THE RIGHTS OF COMMUNITIES
StefanWolff_2010G THE PROVISIONS IN THE AGREEMENT MAY BE COMPLEX
StefanWolff_2010G MOST IMPORTANTLY
StefanWolff_2010G LOCAL LEADERS REPEATEDLY ROSE TO THE CHALLENGE OF COMPROMISE
StefanWolff_2010G NOT ALWAYS FAST AND NOT ALWAYS ENTHUSIASTICALLY
StefanWolff_2010G BUT RISE IN THE
StefanWolff_2010G WHO EVER COULD HAVE IMAGINED IAN PAISLEY AND MARTIN MCGUINNESS JOINTLY GOVERNING NORTHERN IRELAND AS FIRST AND DEPUTY FIRST MINISTER
StefanWolff_2010G THE ENDING OF LIBERIA 'S LONG LASTING CIVIL WAR IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE ILLUSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF LEADERSHIP DIPLOMACY AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN
StefanWolff_2010G AS MUCH AS THE SUCCESSFUL PREVENTION OF A FULL SCALE CIVIL WAR IN MACEDONIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE OR THE SUCCESSFUL ENDING
StefanWolff_2010G THE CONFLICT IN ACEH IN INDONESIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE
StefanWolff_2010G IN ALL THREE CASES LOCAL LEADERS WERE WILLING AND ABLE TO MAKE PEACE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY STOOD READY TO HELP THEM NEGOTIATE AND IMPLEMENT AN AGREEMENT
StefanWolff_2010G AND THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE LIVED UP TO THE PROMISE THAT THEY HELD ON THE DAY THEY WERE AGREED
StefanWolff_2010G FOCUSING ON LEADERSHIP DIPLOMACY AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN
StefanWolff_2010G ALSO HELPS EXPLAIN FAILURES TO ACHIEVE PEACE OR TO MAKE IT LAST
StefanWolff_2010G LOCAL LEADERS COMMITTED TO REVISITING THEM LATER ON
StefanWolff_2010G BY THE SECOND INTIFADA THE EVENTS OF NINE ELEVEN AND THE WARS IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ
StefanWolff_2010G THE COMPREHENSIVE PEACE AGREEMENT FOR SUDAN SIGNED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE TURNED OUT TO BE LESS COMPREHENSIVE THAN ENVISAGED AND ITS PROVISIONS MAY YET BEAR THE SEEDS OF A FULL SCALE RETURN TO WAR BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH
StefanWolff_2010G MORE OFF THAN ON INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMACY
StefanWolff_2010G AND INSTITUTIONAL FAILURES
StefanWolff_2010G ACCOUNT FOR THIS IN ALMOST EQUAL MEASURE
StefanWolff_2010G AND GENERALLY WEAK STATE CAPACITY ACROSS ALL OF SUDAN COMPLETE A VERY DEPRESSING PICTURE
StefanWolff_2010G THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN AFRICA 'S LARGEST COUNTRY
StefanWolff_2010G A FINAL EXAMPLE KOSOVO
StefanWolff_2010G THE FAILURE TO ACHIEVE A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION FOR KOSOVO
StefanWolff_2010G AND THE VIOLENCE TENSION AND DE FACTO PARTITION THAT RESULTED FROM IT HAVE THEIR REASONS IN MANY MANY DIFFERENT FACTORS
StefanWolff_2010G AN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC
StefanWolff_2010G CONCERNS OF SERBS AND ALBANIANS ALIKE
StefanWolff_2010G BY THE SAME TOKEN
StefanWolff_2010G AND HERE WE HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS AGAIN
StefanWolff_2010G THE VERY FACT THAT THERE IS A HIGH LEVEL WELL RESOURCED INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE IN KOSOVO AND THE BALKANS REGION MORE GENERALLY
StefanWolff_2010G AND INTERNATIONAL LEADERS HAVE A CHOICE
StefanWolff_2010G AND THEY CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR THE BETTER
StefanWolff_2010G AS GOOD AS A COLD PEACE
StefanWolff_2010G BUT A COLD PEACE IS STILL BETTER THAN A
StefanWolff_2010G GOOD NEWS IS ALSO ABOUT LEARNING THE RIGHT
StefanWolff_2010G SO WHAT THEN DISTINGUISHES THE ISRAELI PALESTINIAN CONFLICT
StefanWolff_2010G FROM THAT IN NORTHERN IRELAND
StefanWolff_2010G THE CIVIL WAR IN SUDAN FROM THAN IN LIBERIA BOTH
StefanWolff_2010G SUCCESSES AND FAILURES
StefanWolff_2010G IN THE SAME WAY IN WHICH ETHNIC CONFLICT AND CIVIL WAR ARE NOT NATURAL BUT MAN MADE DISASTERS
StefanWolff_2010G THEIR PREVENTION AND SETTLEMENT DOES NOT HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY EITHER
StefanWolff_2010G LEADERSHIP NEEDS TO BE CAPABLE
StefanWolff_2010G DETERMINED AND VISIONARY IN ITS COMMITMENT TO PEACE LEADERS NEED TO CONNECT TO EACH OTHER
StefanWolff_2010G AND TO THEIR
StefanWolff_2010G AND THEY NEED TO BRING THEM ALONG ON WHAT IS AN OFTEN AND ARDUOUS JOURNEY INTO A PEACEFUL FUTURE
StefanWolff_2010G AND APPLY THE RIGHT MIX OF INCENTIVES AND PRESSURES ON LEADERS AND FOLLOWERS IT NEEDS TO HELP THEM REACH AN EQUITABLE COMPROMISE
StefanWolff_2010G AND FLEXIBLE AND WELL FUNDED IMPLEMENTATION CONFLICT PARTIES NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM MAXIMUM DEMANDS
StefanWolff_2010G AND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE
StefanWolff_2010G THAT RECOGNIZES EACH OTHERS NEEDS AND THEY NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF THEIR AGREEMENT MUCH MORE THAN ABOUT THE LABELS THEY WANT TO ATTACH TO THEM
StefanWolff_2010G FOR ME PERSONALLY THE MOST CRITICAL LESSON OF ALL IS THIS
StefanWolff_2010G LOCAL COMMITMENT TO PEACE IS ALL IMPORTANT
StefanWolff_2010G BUT IT IS OFTEN NOT ENOUGH TO PREVENT OR
StefanWolff_2010G YET NO AMOUNT OF DIPLOMACY OR INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN
StefanWolff_2010G CAN MAKE UP FOR LOCAL FAILURES
StefanWolff_2010G WE MUST INVEST IN DEVELOPING
StefanWolff_2010G THAT HAVE THE SKILLS
StefanWolff_2010G LEADERS IN OTHER WORDS
StefanWolff_2010G THAT PEOPLE WILL TRUST
StefanWolff_2010G AND THAT THEY WILL WANT TO FOLLOW
StefanWolff_2010G ENDING CIVIL WARS IS A PROCESS THAT IS FRAUGHT WITH
StefanWolff_2010G IT OFTEN TAKES A GENERATION TO ACCOMPLISH
StefanWolff_2010G BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES US TODAY 'S GENERATION
StefanWolff_2010G TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
StefanWolff_2010G AND TO LEARN THE RIGHT LESSONS ABOUT LEADERSHIP DIPLOMACY AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN
