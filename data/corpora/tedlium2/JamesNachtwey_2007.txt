JamesNachtwey_2007@20.55:27.38 STANDING IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE IS A CROSS BETWEEN AN OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE AND A DEER CAUGHT IN THE HEADLIGHTS
JamesNachtwey_2007@27.57:36.97 SO PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR VIOLATING ONE OF THE TED COMMANDMENTS BY RELYING ON WORDS ON PAPER AND I ONLY HOPE I 'M NOT STRUCK BY LIGHTNING BOLTS BEFORE
JamesNachtwey_2007@44.59:62.4 I WAS A STUDENT IN THE SIXTY S A TIME OF SOCIAL UPHEAVAL AND QUESTIONING AND ON A PERSONAL LEVEL AN AWAKENING SENSE OF IDEALISM THE WAR IN VIETNAM WAS RAGING THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS UNDER WAY AND PICTURES HAD A POWERFUL INFLUENCE ON ME
JamesNachtwey_2007@62.4:73.39 OUR POLITICAL AND MILITARY LEADERS WERE TELLING US ONE THING AND PHOTOGRAPHERS WERE TELLING US ANOTHER I BELIEVED THE PHOTOGRAPHERS AND SO DID MILLIONS OF OTHER AMERICANS
JamesNachtwey_2007@73.39:92.3 THEIR IMAGES FUELED RESISTANCE TO THE WAR AND TO RACISM THEY NOT ONLY RECORDED HISTORY THEY HELPED CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY THEIR PICTURES BECAME PART OF OUR COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS AND AS CONSCIOUSNESS EVOLVED INTO A SHARED SENSE OF CONSCIENCE CHANGE BECAME NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT
JamesNachtwey_2007@93.08:104.96 I SAW THAT THE FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION REPRESENTED BY JOURNALISM SPECIFICALLY VISUAL JOURNALISM CAN BRING INTO FOCUS BOTH THE BENEFITS AND THE COST OF POLITICAL POLICIES
JamesNachtwey_2007@121.75:132.8 IT PUTS A HUMAN FACE ON ISSUES WHICH FROM AFAR CAN APPEAR ABSTRACT OR IDEOLOGICAL OR MONUMENTAL IN THEIR GLOBAL IMPACT WHAT HAPPENS AT GROUND LEVEL
JamesNachtwey_2007@133.63:135.65 FAR FROM THE HALLS OF POWER
JamesNachtwey_2007@135.67:144.84 HAPPENS TO ORDINARY CITIZENS ONE BY ONE AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT DOCUMENTARY PHOTOGRAPHY HAS THE ABILITY TO INTERPRET EVENTS FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW
JamesNachtwey_2007@145.46:159.51 IT GIVES A VOICE TO THOSE WHO OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE A VOICE AND AS A REACTION IT STIMULATES PUBLIC OPINION AND GIVES IMPETUS TO PUBLIC DEBATE THEREBY PREVENTING THE INTERESTED PARTIES FROM TOTALLY CONTROLLING THE AGENDA

JamesNachtwey_2007@171.6:185 THE PRESS IS CERTAINLY A BUSINESS AND IN ORDER TO SURVIVE IT MUST BE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS BUT THE RIGHT BALANCE MUST BE FOUND BETWEEN MARKETING CONSIDERATIONS AND JOURNALISTIC RESPONSIBILITY

JamesNachtwey_2007@205.77:219.53 SEEING THE WAR CREATED SUCH INCREDIBLY HIGH STAKES FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED AND THAT VISUAL JOURNALISM COULD ACTUALLY BECOME A FACTOR IN CONFLICT RESOLUTION I WANTED TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER IN ORDER TO BE A WAR PHOTOGRAPHER
JamesNachtwey_2007@219.53:229.55 BUT I WAS DRIVEN BY AN INHERENT SENSE THAT A PICTURE THAT REVEALED THE TRUE FACE OF WAR WOULD ALMOST BY DEFINITION BE AN ANTI WAR PHOTOGRAPH

JamesNachtwey_2007@342.74:357.7 WITHOUT THE POLITICAL WILL TO FIND COMMON GROUND THE CONTINUAL FRICTION OF TACTIC AND COUNTER TACTIC ONLY CREATES SUSPICION AND HATRED AND VENGEANCE AND PERPETUATES THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE
