JamesNachtwey_2007 STANDING IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE IS A CROSS BETWEEN AN OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE AND A DEER CAUGHT IN THE HEADLIGHTS
JamesNachtwey_2007 SO PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR VIOLATING ONE OF THE TED COMMANDMENTS BY RELYING ON WORDS ON PAPER AND I ONLY HOPE I 'M NOT STRUCK BY LIGHTNING BOLTS BEFORE
JamesNachtwey_2007 I WAS A STUDENT IN THE SIXTY S A TIME OF SOCIAL UPHEAVAL AND QUESTIONING AND ON A PERSONAL LEVEL AN AWAKENING SENSE OF IDEALISM THE WAR IN VIETNAM WAS RAGING THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS UNDER WAY AND PICTURES HAD A POWERFUL INFLUENCE ON ME
JamesNachtwey_2007 OUR POLITICAL AND MILITARY LEADERS WERE TELLING US ONE THING AND PHOTOGRAPHERS WERE TELLING US ANOTHER I BELIEVED THE PHOTOGRAPHERS AND SO DID MILLIONS OF OTHER AMERICANS
JamesNachtwey_2007 THEIR IMAGES FUELED RESISTANCE TO THE WAR AND TO RACISM THEY NOT ONLY RECORDED HISTORY THEY HELPED CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY THEIR PICTURES BECAME PART OF OUR COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS AND AS CONSCIOUSNESS EVOLVED INTO A SHARED SENSE OF CONSCIENCE CHANGE BECAME NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT
JamesNachtwey_2007 I SAW THAT THE FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION REPRESENTED BY JOURNALISM SPECIFICALLY VISUAL JOURNALISM CAN BRING INTO FOCUS BOTH THE BENEFITS AND THE COST OF POLITICAL POLICIES
JamesNachtwey_2007 IT PUTS A HUMAN FACE ON ISSUES WHICH FROM AFAR CAN APPEAR ABSTRACT OR IDEOLOGICAL OR MONUMENTAL IN THEIR GLOBAL IMPACT WHAT HAPPENS AT GROUND LEVEL
JamesNachtwey_2007 FAR FROM THE HALLS OF POWER
JamesNachtwey_2007 HAPPENS TO ORDINARY CITIZENS ONE BY ONE AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT DOCUMENTARY PHOTOGRAPHY HAS THE ABILITY TO INTERPRET EVENTS FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW
JamesNachtwey_2007 IT GIVES A VOICE TO THOSE WHO OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE A VOICE AND AS A REACTION IT STIMULATES PUBLIC OPINION AND GIVES IMPETUS TO PUBLIC DEBATE THEREBY PREVENTING THE INTERESTED PARTIES FROM TOTALLY CONTROLLING THE AGENDA
JamesNachtwey_2007 MUCH AS THEY WOULD LIKE TO COMING OF AGE IN THOSE DAYS MADE REAL THE CONCEPT THAT THE FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL FOR A FREE AND DYNAMIC SOCIETY TO FUNCTION PROPERLY
JamesNachtwey_2007 THE PRESS IS CERTAINLY A BUSINESS AND IN ORDER TO SURVIVE IT MUST BE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS BUT THE RIGHT BALANCE MUST BE FOUND BETWEEN MARKETING CONSIDERATIONS AND JOURNALISTIC RESPONSIBILITY
JamesNachtwey_2007 SOCIETY 'S PROBLEMS CAN 'T BE SOLVED UNTIL THEY 'RE IDENTIFIED ON A HIGHER PLANE THE PRESS IS A SERVICE INDUSTRY AND THE SERVICE IT PROVIDES IS AWARENESS EVERY STORY DOES NOT HAVE TO SELL SOMETHING
JamesNachtwey_2007 THERE 'S ALSO A TIME TO GIVE THAT WAS A TRADITION I WANTED TO FOLLOW
JamesNachtwey_2007 SEEING THE WAR CREATED SUCH INCREDIBLY HIGH STAKES FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED AND THAT VISUAL JOURNALISM COULD ACTUALLY BECOME A FACTOR IN CONFLICT RESOLUTION I WANTED TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER IN ORDER TO BE A WAR PHOTOGRAPHER
JamesNachtwey_2007 BUT I WAS DRIVEN BY AN INHERENT SENSE THAT A PICTURE THAT REVEALED THE TRUE FACE OF WAR WOULD ALMOST BY DEFINITION BE AN ANTI WAR PHOTOGRAPH
JamesNachtwey_2007 I 'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU ON A VISUAL JOURNEY THROUGH SOME OF THE EVENTS AND ISSUES I 'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN OVER THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS
JamesNachtwey_2007 IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE I WENT TO NORTHERN IRELAND TEN IRA PRISONERS WERE IN THE PROCESS OF STARVING THEMSELVES TO DEATH IN PROTEST AGAINST CONDITIONS IN JAIL
JamesNachtwey_2007 THE REACTION ON THE STREETS WAS VIOLENT CONFRONTATION I SAW THAT THE FRONT LINES OF CONTEMPORARY WARS ARE NOT ON ISOLATED BATTLEFIELDS BUT RIGHT WHERE PEOPLE LIVE
JamesNachtwey_2007 IN GUATEMALA THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED BY A OLIGARCHY OF EUROPEAN DECENT WAS WAGING A SCORCHED EARTH CAMPAIGN AGAINST AN INDIGENOUS REBELLION AND I SAW AN IMAGE THAT REFLECTED THE HISTORY OF LATIN AMERICA CONQUEST THROUGH A COMBINATION OF THE BIBLE AND THE SWORD
JamesNachtwey_2007 AN ANTI SANDINISTA GUERRILLA WAS MORTALLY WOUNDED AS COMMANDER ZERO ATTACKED A TOWN IN SOUTHERN NICARAGUA
JamesNachtwey_2007 AND WAS TRANSFORMED BY THE ENERGY AND SPIRIT OF A CHILD

JamesNachtwey_2007 I 'VE BEEN COVERING THE PALESTINIAN ISRAELI CONFLICT SINCE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE THIS IS A MOMENT FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND INTIFADA IN TWO THOUSAND WHEN IT WAS STILL STONES AND MOLOTOVS AGAINST AN ARMY
JamesNachtwey_2007 IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE THE UPRISING ESCALATED INTO AN ARMED CONFLICT AND ONE OF THE MAJOR INCIDENTS WAS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMP IN THE WEST BANK TOWN OF JENIN
JamesNachtwey_2007 WITHOUT THE POLITICAL WILL TO FIND COMMON GROUND THE CONTINUAL FRICTION OF TACTIC AND COUNTER TACTIC ONLY CREATES SUSPICION AND HATRED AND VENGEANCE AND PERPETUATES THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE
JamesNachtwey_2007 A MOSQUE IN NORTHERN BOSNIA WAS DESTROYED BY SERBIAN ARTILLERY AND WAS USED AS A MAKESHIFT

JamesNachtwey_2007 AT THE SAME TIME IN SOUTH AFRICA AFTER NELSON MANDELA HAD BEEN RELEASED FROM PRISON THE BLACK POPULATION COMMENCED THE FINAL PHASE OF LIBERATION FROM APARTHEID
JamesNachtwey_2007 ONE OF THE THINGS I HAD TO LEARN AS A JOURNALIST WAS WHAT TO DO WITH MY ANGER I HAD TO USE IT CHANNEL ITS ENERGY TURN IT INTO SOMETHING THAT WOULD CLARIFY MY VISION INSTEAD OF CLOUDING IT
JamesNachtwey_2007 IT WAS A VERY OLD RITUAL THAT SEEMED SYMBOLIC OF THE POLITICAL STRUGGLE THAT WAS CHANGING THE FACE OF SOUTH AFRICA
JamesNachtwey_2007 ELSEWHERE IN AFRICA THERE WAS FAMINE
JamesNachtwey_2007 IN SOMALIA THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT COLLAPSED AND CLAN WARFARE BROKE OUT FARMERS WERE DRIVEN OFF THEIR LAND AND CROPS AND LIVESTOCK WERE DESTROYED OR STOLEN STARVATION WAS BEING USED AS A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION PRIMITIVE BUT EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
JamesNachtwey_2007 PEOPLE WERE EXTERMINATED SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY
JamesNachtwey_2007 THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY RESPONDED WITH MASSIVE HUMANITARIAN RELIEF AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MORE LIVES WERE SAVED AMERICAN TROOPS WERE SENT TO PROTECT THE RELIEF SHIPMENTS BUT THEY WERE EVENTUALLY DRAWN INTO THE CONFLICT AND AFTER THE TRAGIC BATTLE IN MOGADISHU THEY WERE
JamesNachtwey_2007 I 'M A WITNESS AND I WANT MY TESTIMONY TO BE HONEST AND UNCENSORED
JamesNachtwey_2007 I ALSO WANT IT TO BE POWERFUL AND ELOQUENT AND TO DO AS MUCH JUSTICE AS POSSIBLE TO THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PEOPLE I 'M PHOTOGRAPHING THIS MAN WAS IN AN NGO FEEDING CENTER BEING HELPED AS MUCH AS HE COULD BE HELPED HE LITERALLY HAD NOTHING
JamesNachtwey_2007 HE WAS A VIRTUAL SKELETON
JamesNachtwey_2007 YET HE COULD STILL SUMMON THE COURAGE AND THE WILL TO MOVE HE HAD NOT GIVEN UP AND IF HE DIDN 'T GIVE UP HOW COULD ANYONE IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD EVER DREAM OF LOSING HOPE
JamesNachtwey_2007 AND IT WAS THE MOST UPLIFTING THING I 'VE EVER SEEN
JamesNachtwey_2007 THIS MAN HAD JUST BEEN LIBERATED FROM A HUTU DEATH
JamesNachtwey_2007 I THINK HE KNEW WHAT THE SCARS ON HIS FACE WOULD SAY TO THE REST OF THE
JamesNachtwey_2007 THIS TIME MAYBE CONFUSED OR DISCOURAGED BY THE MILITARY DISASTER IN SOMALIA THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY REMAINED SILENT AND SOMEWHERE AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE SLAUGHTERED BY THEIR OWN COUNTRYMEN SOMETIMES THEIR OWN NEIGHBORS USING FARM IMPLEMENTS AS WEAPONS
JamesNachtwey_2007 PERHAPS BECAUSE A LESSON HAD BEEN LEARNED BY THE WEAK RESPONSE TO THE WAR IN BOSNIA AND THE FAILURE IN RWANDA
JamesNachtwey_2007 WHEN SERBIA ATTACKED KOSOVO INTERNATIONAL ACTION WAS TAKEN MUCH MORE DECISIVELY NATO FORCES WENT IN AND THE SERBIAN ARMY WITHDREW
JamesNachtwey_2007 ETHNIC ALBANIANS HAD BEEN MURDERED THEIR FARMS DESTROYED AND A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FORCIBLY DEPORTED
JamesNachtwey_2007 THEY WERE RECEIVED IN REFUGEE CAMPS SET UP BY NGOS IN ALBANIA AND MACEDONIA
JamesNachtwey_2007 THE IMPRINT OF A MAN WHO HAD BEEN BURNED INSIDE HIS OWN HOME THE IMAGE REMINDED ME OF A CAVE
JamesNachtwey_2007 I FOUND A BOY FROM THE LOCAL ORPHANAGE WANDERING AROUND THE FRONT LINE
JamesNachtwey_2007 MY WORK HAS EVOLVED FROM BEING CONCERNED MAINLY WITH WAR TO A FOCUS ON CRITICAL SOCIAL ISSUES AS WELL
JamesNachtwey_2007 AFTER THE FALL OF CEAUSESCU I WENT TO ROMANIA AND DISCOVERED A KIND OF GULAG OF CHILDREN WHERE THOUSANDS OF ORPHANS WERE BEING KEPT IN MEDIEVAL CONDITIONS

JamesNachtwey_2007 I SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME WITH A MAN WHO LIVED WITH HIS FAMILY ON A RAILWAY EMBANKMENT AND HAD LOST AN ARM AND A LEG IN A TRAIN ACCIDENT
JamesNachtwey_2007 WHEN THE STORY WAS PUBLISHED UNSOLICITED DONATIONS POURED IN A TRUST FUND WAS ESTABLISHED AND THE FAMILY NOW LIVES IN A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AND ALL THEIR BASIC NECESSITIES ARE TAKEN CARE OF IT WAS A STORY THAT WASN 'T TRYING TO SELL ANYTHING
JamesNachtwey_2007 JOURNALISM HAD PROVIDED A CHANNEL FOR PEOPLE 'S NATURAL SENSE OF GENEROSITY AND THE READERS RESPONDED
JamesNachtwey_2007 I MET A BAND OF HOMELESS CHILDREN WHO 'D COME TO JAKARTA FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE AND ENDED UP LIVING IN A TRAIN STATION BY THE AGE OF TWELVE OR FOURTEEN THEY 'D BECOME BEGGARS AND DRUG ADDICTS THE RURAL POOR HAD BECOME THE URBAN POOR AND IN THE PROCESS THEY 'D BECOME INVISIBLE
JamesNachtwey_2007 THESE HEROIN ADDICTS IN DETOX IN PAKISTAN REMINDED ME OF FIGURES IN A PLAY BY
JamesNachtwey_2007 ISOLATED WAITING IN THE DARK BUT DRAWN TO THE LIGHT
JamesNachtwey_2007 I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT PEOPLE WERE BEING HELPED WHETHER BY INTERNATIONAL NGOS OR BY LOCAL GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS SO MANY CHILDREN HAVE BEEN ORPHANED BY THE EPIDEMIC THAT GRANDMOTHERS HAVE TAKEN THE PLACE OF PARENTS AND A LOT OF CHILDREN HAD BEEN BORN WITH HIV

JamesNachtwey_2007 A PRISONER ON A CHAIN GANG IN ALABAMA WAS PUNISHED BY BEING HANDCUFFED TO A POST IN THE MIDDAY SUN

JamesNachtwey_2007 I DIDN 'T SEE EITHER OF THE PLANES HIT AND WHEN I GLANCED OUT MY WINDOW I SAW THE FIRST TOWER BURNING AND I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT
JamesNachtwey_2007 A FEW MINUTES LATER WHEN I LOOKED AGAIN AND SAW THE SECOND TOWER BURNING I KNEW WE WERE
JamesNachtwey_2007 AT THE TIME I WAS PHOTOGRAPHING IN THESE DIFFERENT PLACES I THOUGHT I WAS COVERING SEPARATE STORIES BUT ON NINE ELEVEN HISTORY CRYSTALLIZED AND I UNDERSTOOD I 'D ACTUALLY BEEN COVERING A SINGLE STORY FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AND THE ATTACK ON NEW YORK WAS ITS LATEST MANIFESTATION
