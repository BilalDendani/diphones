JonasEliasson_2012X@31.15:51.14 I MEAN YOU HAVE THE TYPICAL EUROPEAN CITIES WITH A DENSE URBAN CORE GOOD PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION MOSTLY NOT A LOT OF ROAD CAPACITY BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE THE AMERICAN CITIES IT 'S MOVING BY ITSELF OKAY ANYWAY THE AMERICAN CITIES LOTS OF ROADS DISPERSED OVER LARGE AREAS ALMOST NO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
JonasEliasson_2012X@51.14:60.06 AND THEN YOU HAVE THE EMERGING WORLD CITIES WITH A MIXED VARIETY OF VEHICLES MIXED LAND USE PATTERNS ALSO RATHER DISPERSED BUT OFTEN WITH A VERY DENSE URBAN CORE
JonasEliasson_2012X@60.06:74.92 AND TRAFFIC PLANNERS ALL AROUND THE WORLD HAVE TRIED LOTS OF DIFFERENT MEASURES DENSE CITIES OR DISPERSED CITIES LOTS OF ROADS OR LOTS OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT OR LOTS OF BIKE LANES OR MORE INFORMATION OR LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS BUT NOTHING SEEMS TO WORK
JonasEliasson_2012X@74.92:90.29 BUT ALL OF THESE ATTEMPTS HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON THEY 'RE BASICALLY ATTEMPTS AT FIGURING OUT WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD DO INSTEAD OF RUSH HOUR CAR DRIVING THEY 'RE ESSENTIALLY TO A POINT ATTEMPTS AT PLANNING WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SHOULD DO PLANNING THEIR LIFE FOR THEM
JonasEliasson_2012X@90.29:95.58 NOW PLANNING A COMPLEX SOCIAL SYSTEM IS A VERY HARD THING TO DO AND LET ME TELL YOU A STORY
JonasEliasson_2012X@105.34:119.81 I 'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO 'S IN CHARGE OF LONDON 'S BREAD SUPPLY AND THE URBAN PLANNER IN LONDON GOES WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHO 'S IN CHARGE OF LONDON 'S I MEAN NO ONE IS IN CHARGE OH BUT SURELY SOMEONE MUST BE IN CHARGE I MEAN IT 'S A VERY COMPLICATED SYSTEM SOMEONE MUST CONTROL ALL OF THIS
JonasEliasson_2012X@119.81:127.58 NO NO NO ONE IS IN CHARGE I MEAN IT BASICALLY I HAVEN 'T REALLY THOUGHT OF IT IT BASICALLY ORGANIZES ITSELF
JonasEliasson_2012X@127.58:138.12 IT ORGANIZES ITSELF THAT 'S AN EXAMPLE OF A COMPLEX SOCIAL SYSTEM WHICH HAS THE ABILITY OF SELF ORGANIZING AND THIS IS A VERY DEEP INSIGHT
JonasEliasson_2012X@138.12:151.71 WHEN YOU TRY TO SOLVE REALLY COMPLEX SOCIAL PROBLEMS THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS MOST OF THE TIME TO CREATE THE INCENTIVES YOU DON 'T PLAN THE DETAILS AND PEOPLE WILL FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO HOW TO ADAPT TO THIS NEW FRAMEWORK
JonasEliasson_2012X@194.85:207.22 SO YOU WOULD PROBABLY EXPECT THAT CAR DRIVERS WOULDN 'T REALLY REACT TO THIS FAIRLY SMALL CHARGE YOU WOULD BE WRONG ONE OR TWO EUROS WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE TWENTY PERCENT OF CARS DISAPPEAR FROM RUSH HOURS
JonasEliasson_2012X@207.22:217.16 NOW TWENTY PERCENT WELL THAT 'S A FAIRLY HUGE FIGURE YOU MIGHT THINK BUT YOU 'VE STILL GOT EIGHTY PERCENT LEFT OF THE PROBLEM RIGHT BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE TRAFFIC NOW THAT 'S ALSO WRONG
JonasEliasson_2012X@217.16:223.31 BECAUSE TRAFFIC HAPPENS TO BE A NONLINEAR PHENOMENON MEANING THAT ONCE YOU REACH ABOVE A CERTAIN
JonasEliasson_2012X@243.17:246.68 AND THE FIRST PICTURE HERE IS A PICTURE OF STOCKHOLM ONE OF THE TYPICAL STREETS
JonasEliasson_2012X@269.76:282.24 IT 'S NOW SIX AND A HALF YEARS AGO SINCE THE CONGESTION CHARGES WERE INTRODUCED IN STOCKHOLM AND WE BASICALLY HAVE THE SAME LOW TRAFFIC LEVELS STILL BUT YOU SEE THERE 'S AN INTERESTING GAP HERE IN THE TIME SERIES IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
JonasEliasson_2012X@307.36:312.41 BUT IT WAS FUN ANYWAY SO WE FOLLOWED UP WHAT HAPPENED
JonasEliasson_2012X@312.41:322.13 THIS IS THE LAST DAY WITH THE CONGESTION CHARGES JULY THIRTY ONE AND YOU SEE THE SAME STREET BUT NOW IT 'S SUMMER AND SUMMER IN STOCKHOLM IS A VERY NICE AND LIGHT TIME OF THE YEAR
JonasEliasson_2012X@334.32:344.73 AND THIS EFFECT HANGED ON SO TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN FIGURES LOOKED LIKE THIS NOW THESE TRAFFIC FIGURES ARE REALLY EXCITING AND A LITTLE BIT SURPRISING AND VERY USEFUL TO KNOW
JonasEliasson_2012X@355.03:364.93 AND YOU SEE THAT WHEN CONGESTION PRICING WERE INTRODUCED IN THE BEGINNING OF SPRING TWO THOUSAND AND SIX PEOPLE WERE FIERCELY AGAINST IT SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION DIDN 'T WANT THIS
JonasEliasson_2012X@364.93:378.71 BUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE CONGESTION CHARGES WERE THERE IS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT PEOPLE HATED IT MORE AND MORE NO ON THE CONTRARY THEY CHANGED UP TO A POINT WHERE WE NOW HAVE SEVENTY PERCENT SUPPORT FOR KEEPING THE CHARGES MEANING THAT I MEAN LET ME REPEAT THAT
JonasEliasson_2012X@378.71:385.15 SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION IN STOCKHOLM WANT TO KEEP A PRICE FOR SOMETHING THAT USED TO BE FREE
JonasEliasson_2012X@403.19:412.33 WELL SO WE DID THIS HUGE INTERVIEW SURVEY WITH LOTS OF TRAVEL SERVICES AND TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHO CHANGED AND WHERE DID THEY GO AND IT TURNED OUT THAT THEY DON 'T KNOW THEMSELVES
JonasEliasson_2012X@426.42:446.41 EACH DAY PEOPLE MAKE NEW DECISIONS AND PEOPLE CHANGE AND THE WORLD CHANGES AROUND THEM AND EACH DAY ALL OF THESE DECISIONS ARE SORT OF NUDGED EVER SO SLIGHTLY AWAY FROM RUSH HOUR CAR DRIVING IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE DON 'T EVEN NOTICE THEY 'RE NOT EVEN AWARE OF THIS THEMSELVES AND THE OTHER QUESTION WHO CHANGED THEIR MIND WHO CHANGED THEIR OPINION AND WHY
JonasEliasson_2012X@453.51:459.67 AND AFTER ANALYZING THE ANSWERS IT TURNED OUT THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THEM BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVEN 'T CHANGED THEIR MINDS
