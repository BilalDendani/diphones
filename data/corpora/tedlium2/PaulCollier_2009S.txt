PaulCollier_2009S@16.72:25.96 I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT POST CONFLICT RECOVERY AND HOW WE MIGHT DO POST CONFLICT RECOVERY BETTER
PaulCollier_2009S@26.85:36.74 THE RECORD ON POST CONFLICT RECOVERY IS NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE FORTY PERCENT OF ALL POST CONFLICT SITUATIONS HISTORICALLY
PaulCollier_2009S@36.93:43.59 HAVE REVERTED BACK TO CONFLICT WITHIN A DECADE IN FACT THEY'VE ACCOUNTED FOR HALF OF ALL CIVIL
PaulCollier_2009S@46.10:54.79 HAS THE RECORD BEEN SO POOR WELL THE CONVENTIONAL APPROACH TO POST CONFLICT SITUATIONS HAS RESTED ON
PaulCollier_2009S@55.29:68.22 ON KIND OF THREE PRINCIPLES THE FIRST PRINCIPLE IS IT'S THE POLITICS THAT MATTERS SO THE FIRST THING THAT IS PRIORITIZED IS POLITICS TRY AND BUILD A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT
PaulCollier_2009S@70.45:80.96 AND THEN THE SECOND STEP IS TO SAY THE SITUATION IS ADMITTEDLY DANGEROUS BUT ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME SO GET PEACEKEEPERS THERE BUT GET THEM HOME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
PaulCollier_2009S@81.70:88.54 SO SHORT TERM PEACEKEEPERS AND THIRDLY WHAT IS THE EXIT STRATEGY FOR THE PEACEKEEPERS
PaulCollier_2009S@88.83:97.58 IT'S AN ELECTION THAT WILL PRODUCE A LEGITIMATE AND ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENT SO THAT'S THE CONVENTIONAL APPROACH
PaulCollier_2009S@98.28:105.78 I THINK THAT APPROACH DENIES REALITY WE SEE THAT THERE IS NO QUICK FIX
PaulCollier_2009S@106.43:116.94 CERTAINLY NO QUICK SECURITY FIX I'VE TRIED TO LOOK AT THE RISKS OF REVERSION TO CONFLICT DURING OUR POST CONFLICT DECADE AND THE RISKS STAY HIGH THROUGHOUT THE
PaulCollier_2009S@118.65:130.00 AND THEY STAY HIGH REGARDLESS OF THE POLITICAL INNOVATIONS DOES AN ELECTION PRODUCE AN ACCOUNTABLE AND LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT
PaulCollier_2009S@130.47:135.95 WHAT AN ELECTION PRODUCES IS A WINNER AND A LOSER AND THE LOSER
PaulCollier_2009S@140.04:148.42 THE REALITY IS THAT WE NEED TO REVERSE THE SEQUENCE IT'S NOT THE POLITICS FIRST IT'S ACTUALLY THE POLITICS LAST
PaulCollier_2009S@148.68:157.05 THE POLITICS BECOME EASIER AS THE DECADE PROGRESSES IF YOU'RE BUILDING ON A FOUNDATION OF SECURITY AND
PaulCollier_2009S@157.93:170.40 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THE REBUILDING OF PROSPERITY WHY DOES THE POLITICS GET EASIER AND WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT INITIALLY BECAUSE AFTER YEARS OF STAGNATION AND DECLINE
PaulCollier_2009S@170.80:180.74 THE MENTALITY OF POLITICS IS THAT IT'S A ZERO SUM GAME IF THE REALITY IS STAGNATION I CAN ONLY GO UP IF YOU GO DOWN
PaulCollier_2009S@181.38:194.10 AND THAT DOESN'T PRODUCE A PRODUCTIVE POLITICS AND SO THE MENTALITY HAS TO SHIFT FROM ZERO SUM TO POSITIVE SUM BEFORE YOU CAN GET A PRODUCTIVE POLITICS
PaulCollier_2009S@194.90:204.51 YOU CAN ONLY GET POSITIVE THAT MENTAL SHIFT IF THE REALITY IS THAT PROSPERITY IS BEING BUILT AND IN ORDER TO BUILD PROSPERITY WE NEED SECURITY
PaulCollier_2009S@206.24:214.58 SO THAT IS WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU FACE REALITY BUT THE OBJECTIVE OF FACING REALITY IS TO CHANGE REALITY AND SO NOW LET ME SUGGEST
PaulCollier_2009S@226.89:230.95 ACTORS WHO ARE DIFFERENT ACTORS AND AT THE MOMENT
PaulCollier_2009S@233.10:244.22 THE FIRST ACTOR IS THE SECURITY COUNCIL THE SECURITY COUNCIL TYPICALLY HAS THE RESPONSIBLITY FOR PROVIDING THE PEACEKEEPERS WHO BUILD THE SECURITY
PaulCollier_2009S@244.80:251.84 AND THAT NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED FIRST OF ALL THAT PEACEKEEPING WORKS IT IS A COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH
PaulCollier_2009S@252.26:260.21 IT DOES INCREASE SECURITY BUT IT NEEDS TO BE DONE LONG TERM IT NEEDS TO BE A DECADE LONG APPROACH RATHER THAN JUST A COUPLE
PaulCollier_2009S@282.82:293.82 POST CONFLICT ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS A SLOW PROCESS THERE ARE NO QUICK PROCESSES IN ECONOMICS EXCEPT DECLINE YOU CAN DO THAT QUITE FAST
PaulCollier_2009S@303.77:313.46 AND THEN THE THIRD KEY ACTOR IS THE POST CONFLICT GOVERNMENT AND THERE ARE TWO KEY THINGS IT'S GOT TO DO ONE IS IT'S GOT TO DO ECONOMIC
PaulCollier_2009S@315.02:322.52 NOT FUSS ABOUT THE POLITICAL CONSTITUTION IT'S GOT TO REFORM ECONOMIC POLICY WHY BECAUSE DURING CONFLICT
PaulCollier_2009S@337.36:347.80 SO THERE IS A REFORM AGENDA AND THERE IS A AN INCLUSION AGENDA THE INCLUSION AGENDA DOESN'T COME FROM ELECTIONS ELECTIONS PRODUCE A LOSER WHO IS THEN EXCLUDED
PaulCollier_2009S@348.86:360.40 SO THE INCLUSION AGENDA MEANS GENUINELY BRINGING PEOPLE INSIDE THE TENT SO THOSE THREE ACTORS AND THEY ARE INTERDEPENDENT OVER A LONG
PaulCollier_2009S@362.14:371.81 IF THE SECURITY COUNCIL DOESN'T COMMIT TO SECURITY OVER THE COURSE OF A DECADE YOU DON'T GET THE REASSURANCE WHICH PRODUCES PRIVATE INVESTMENT
PaulCollier_2009S@372.38:385.25 IF YOU DON'T GET THE POLICY REFORM AND THE AID YOU DON'T GET THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY WHICH IS THE TRUE EXIT STRATEGY FOR THE PEACEKEEPERS SO WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT INTERDEPENDENCE
PaulCollier_2009S@409.02:421.88 BE IDEAL TO HAVE A STANDARD SET OF NORMS WHERE WHEN WE GOT TO A POST CONFLICT SITUATION THERE WAS AN EXPECTATION OF THESE MUTUAL COMMITMENTS FROM THE
PaulCollier_2009S@424.58:432.29 SO THAT'S IDEA ONE RECOGNIZE INTERDEPENDENCE AND NOW LET ME TURN TO THE SECOND
PaulCollier_2009S@432.67:441.60 APPROACH WHICH IS COMPLIMENTARY AND THAT IS TO FOCUS ON A FEW CRITICAL OBJECTIVES
PaulCollier_2009S@454.60:463.40 YOU GET A VERY UNFOCUSED AGENDA BECAUSE IN THESE SITUATIONS NEEDS ARE EVERYWHERE BUT THE CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT CHANGE IS VERY
PaulCollier_2009S@464.33:474.05 SO WE HAVE TO BE DISCIPLINED AND FOCUS ON THINGS THAT ARE CRITICAL AND I WANT TO SUGGEST THAT IN THE TYPICAL POST CONFLICT SITUTATION THREE THINGS ARE CRITICAL
PaulCollier_2009S@474.80:480.42 ONE IS JOBS ONE IS IMPROVEMENTS IN BASIC SERVICES ESPECIALLY HEALTH WHICH IS
PaulCollier_2009S@485.63:495.95 AND CLEAN GOVERNMENT THOSE ARE THE THREE CRITICAL PRIORITIES SO I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT EACH OF THEM JOBS
PaulCollier_2009S@496.87:509.05 WHAT IS A DISTINCTIVE APPROACH TO GENERATING JOBS IN POST CONFLICT SITUATIONS AND WHY ARE JOBS SO IMPORTANT JOBS FOR WHOM ESPECIALLY JOBS FOR YOUNG MEN
PaulCollier_2009S@509.36:519.75 IN POST CONFLICT SITUATIONS THE REASON THAT THEY SO OFTEN REVERT TO CONFLICT IS NOT BECAUSE ELDERLY WOMEN GET UPSET IT'S BECAUSE YOUNG MEN
PaulCollier_2009S@520.54:533.25 AND WHY ARE THEY UPSET BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO AND SO WE NEED A PROCESS OF GENERATING JOBS FOR ORDINARY YOUNG MEN FAST NOW
PaulCollier_2009S@546.05:553.63 IN FACT YOU'RE BUILDING A LONG TERM LIABILITY BY INFLATING CIVIL SERVICE BUT GETTING THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO EXPAND
PaulCollier_2009S@554.46:567.07 ALSO DIFFICULT BECAUSE ANY ACTIVITY WHICH IS OPEN TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE IS BASICALLY GOING TO BE UNCOMPETITIVE IN A POST CONFLICT SITUATION THESE ARE NOT ENVIRONMENTS WHERE YOU CAN BUILD EXPORT
PaulCollier_2009S@568.73:576.92 THERE'S ONE SECTOR WHICH ISN'T EXPOSED TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WHICH CAN GENERATE A LOT OF JOBS
PaulCollier_2009S@577.16:584.20 AND WHICH IS IN ANY CASE A SENSIBLE SECTOR TO EXPAND POST CONFLICT AND THAT IS THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR
PaulCollier_2009S@585.05:595.46 THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR HAS A VITAL ROLE OBVIOUSLY IN RECONSTRUCTION BUT TYPICALLY THAT SECTOR HAS WHITHERED AWAY DURING CONFLICT
PaulCollier_2009S@595.74:605.74 DURING CONFLICT PEOPLE ARE DOING DESTRUCTION THERE ISN'T ANY CONSTRUCTION GOING ON AND SO THE SECTOR SHRIVELS AWAY AND THEN WHEN YOU TRY AND EXPAND IT BECAUSE IT'S SHRIVELED AWAY
PaulCollier_2009S@606.32:614.05 YOU ENCOUNTER A LOT OF BOTTLENECKS BASICALLY PRICES SOAR AND CROOKED POLITICIANS THEN MILK THE RENTS
PaulCollier_2009S@614.27:621.98 FROM THE SECTOR BUT IT DOESN'T GENERATE ANY JOBS AND SO THE POLICY PRIORITY IS TO BREAK THE BOTTLENECKS IN EXPANDING THE CONSTRUCTION
PaulCollier_2009S@623.72:629.98 WHAT MIGHT THE BOTTLENECKS BE JUST THINK WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO SUCCESSFULLY TO BUILD A STRUCTURE USING A LOT
PaulCollier_2009S@631.44:641.55 FIRST YOU NEED ACCESS TO LAND OFTEN THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS BROKEN DOWN SO YOU CAN'T EVEN GET ACCESS TO LAND SECONDLY YOU NEED SKILLS THE MUNDANE SKILLS OF THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR
PaulCollier_2009S@642.91:650.30 IN POST CONFLICT SITUATIONS WE DON'T JUST NEED DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS WE NEED BRICKLAYERS WITHOUT BORDERS TO REBUILD THE
PaulCollier_2009S@652.50:666.26 WE NEED FIRMS THE FIRMS HAVE GONE AWAY SO WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE THE GROWTH OF LOCAL FIRMS IF WE DO THAT WE NOT ONLY GET THE JOBS WE GET THE IMPROVEMENTS IN PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE THE RESTORATION OF PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE
PaulCollier_2009S@667.73:676.46 FROM JOBS TO THE SECOND OBJECTIVE WHICH IS IMPROVING BASIC SOCIAL SERVICES
PaulCollier_2009S@677.22:685.46 AND TO DATE THERE HAS BEEN A SORT OF A SCHIZOPHRENIA IN THE DONOR COMMUNITY AS TO HOW TO BUILD BASIC SERVICES
PaulCollier_2009S@685.86:693.92 IN THE POST CONFLICT SECTORS ON THE ONE HAND IT PAYS LIP SERVICE TO THE IDEA OF REBUILD AN EFFECTIVE STATE
PaulCollier_2009S@694.59:700.02 IN THE IMAGE OF SCANDINAVIA IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES LETS DEVELOP LINE MINISTRIES OF THIS THAT AND THE
PaulCollier_2009S@703.91:712.44 BECAUSE IN THEIR HEARTS DONORS KNOW THAT'S NOT A REALISTIC AGENDA AND SO WHAT THEY ALSO DO IS THE TOTAL BYPASS JUST
PaulCollier_2009S@716.69:717.72 THOSE APPROACHES
PaulCollier_2009S@720.52:735.07 SO WHAT I'D SUGGEST IS WHAT I CALL INDEPENDENT SERVICE AUTHORITIES IT'S TO SPLIT THE FUNCTIONS OF A MONOPOLY LINE MINISTRY UP INTO THREE THE PLANNING FUNCTION AND POLICY FUNCTION STAYS WITH THE MINISTRY
PaulCollier_2009S@735.54:746.48 THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES ON THE GROUND YOU SHOULD USE WHATEVER WORKS CHURCHES NGOS LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHATEVER WORKS AND IN BETWEEN
PaulCollier_2009S@746.96:754.53 SHOULD BE A PUBLIC AGENCY THE INDEPENDENT SERVICE AUTHORITY WHICH CHANNELS PUBLIC MONEY AND ESPECIALLY DONOR MONEY TO
PaulCollier_2009S@755.03:763.69 THE RETAIL PROVIDERS SO THE NGOS BECOME PART OF A PUBLIC GOVERNMENT SYSTEM RATHER THAN INDEPENDENT
PaulCollier_2009S@764.86:776.34 ONE ADVANTAGE OF THAT IS THAT YOU CAN ALLOCATE MONEY COHERENTLY ANOTHER IS YOU CAN MAKE NGOS ACCOUNTABLE YOU CAN USE YARDSTICK COMPETITION SO THEY HAVE TO COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER
PaulCollier_2009S@777.22:783.38 FOR THE RESOURCES THE GOOD NGOS LIKE OXFAM ARE VERY KEEN ON THIS IDEA THEY WANT
PaulCollier_2009S@800.86:808.43 UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND SOME NGO THEY WOULD BE CO BRANDED AS BEING DONE BY THE POST CONFLICT GOVERNMENT
PaulCollier_2009S@811.57:819.41 SO JOBS BASIC SERVICES FINALLY CLEAN GOVERNMENT CLEAN MEANS FOLLOW THEIR MONEY
PaulCollier_2009S@820.18:827.17 THE TYPICAL POST CONFLICT GOVERNMENT IS SO SHORT OF MONEY THAT IT NEEDS OUR MONEY
PaulCollier_2009S@827.61:835.69 JUST TO BE ON A LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM YOU CAN'T GET THE BASIC FUNCTIONS OF THE STATE DONE UNLESS WE PUT MONEY INTO THE CORE BUDGET
PaulCollier_2009S@836.72:850.20 THESE COUNTRIES BUT IF WE PUT MONEY INTO THE CORE BUDGET WE KNOW THAT THERE AREN'T THE BUDGET SYSTEMS WITH INTEGRITY THAT MEAN THAT MONEY WILL BE WELL SPENT
PaulCollier_2009S@851.09:860.72 AND IF ALL WE DO IS PUT MONEY IN AND CLOSE OUR EYES IT'S NOT JUST THAT THE MONEY IS WASTED THAT'S THE LEAST OF THE PROBLEMS IT'S THAT THE MONEY IS CAPTURED
PaulCollier_2009S@861.72:871.92 IT'S CAPTURED BY THE CROOKS WHO ARE AT THE HEART OF THE POLITICAL PROBLEM AND SO INADVERTENTLY WE EMPOWER THE PEOPLE WHO
PaulCollier_2009S@895.34:902.52 I REALIZE WHAT I NEEDED WAS ACCOUNTANTS WITHOUT BORDERS TO FOLLOW THAT
PaulCollier_2009S@904.53:914.72 SO THAT'S THE LET ME WRAP UP THIS IS THE PACKAGE WHAT'S THE GOAL IF WE FOLLOW THIS WHAT WOULD WE
PaulCollier_2009S@917.00:923.75 AFTER TEN YEARS THE FOCUS ON THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR WOULD HAVE PRODUCED BOTH JOBS
PaulCollier_2009S@923.95:931.70 AND HENCE SECURITY BECAUSE YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD HAVE JOBS AND IT WOULD HAVE RECONSTRUCTED THE INFRASTRUCTURE
PaulCollier_2009S@932.43:940.08 SO THAT'S THE FOCUS ON THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR THE FOCUS ON THE BASIC SERVICE DELIVERY THROUGH THESE INDEPENDENT SERVICE AUTHORITIES WOULD
PaulCollier_2009S@941.02:952.61 RESCUED BASIC SERVICES FROM THEIR CATASTROPHIC LEVELS AND IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN ORDINARY PEOPLE THE SENSE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS DOING SOMETHING USEFUL
PaulCollier_2009S@953.46:962.20 THE EMPHASIS ON CLEAN GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE GRADUALLY SQUEEZED OUT THE POLITICAL CROOKS BECAUSE THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY MONEY
PaulCollier_2009S@962.88:971.88 IN TAKING PART IN THE POLITICS AND SO GRADUALLY THE SELECTION THE COMPOSITION OF POLITICIANS WOULD SHIFT FROM THE CROOKED TO THE
PaulCollier_2009S@974.04:974.24 WHERE
PaulCollier_2009S@975.35:983.32 THAT LEAVE US GRADUALLY IT WOULD SHIFT FROM A POLITICS OF PLUNDER TO A POLITICS OF
