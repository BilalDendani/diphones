WadeDavis_2012 IT 'S A VALLEY WHERE IN A LONG DAY PERHAPS TOO YOU CAN FOLLOW THE TRACKS OF GRIZZLY AND WOLF
WadeDavis_2012 AND DRINK FROM THE VERY SOURCES OF WATER
WadeDavis_2012 GAVE RISE AND CRADLED THE GREAT CIVILIZATIONS OF THE NORTHWEST COAST
WadeDavis_2012 IT 'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PLACE IT 'S THE MOST STUNNINGLY WILD PLACE I 'VE EVER BEEN IT 'S THE SORT OF PLACE THAT WE AS CANADIANS COULD THROW ENGLAND

WadeDavis_2012 IN THE LOWER FORTY EIGHT THE FARTHEST YOU CAN GET AWAY FROM A MAINTAINED ROAD IS TWENTY MILES
WadeDavis_2012 IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA AN AREA OF LAND THE SIZE OF OREGON THERE 'S ONE ROAD A NARROW RIBBON OF ASPHALT THAT SLIPS UP THE SIDE OF THE COAST MOUNTAINS TO THE YUKON
WadeDavis_2012 I FOLLOWED THAT ROAD IN THE EARLY ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY S SOON AFTER IT WAS BUILT TO TAKE A JOB AS THE FIRST PARK RANGER IN SPATSIZI WILDERNESS

WadeDavis_2012 IT WAS ONLY WHEN ALEX PASSED AWAY THAT I REALIZED THAT THE EYELIDS IN SOME SENSE WERE MY OWN AND HAVING DONE SO MUCH TO ALLOW ME TO LEARN TO SEE ALEX IN HIS OWN WAY WAS SAYING GOODBYE
WadeDavis_2012 WELL ISOLATION HAS BEEN THE GREAT SAVING GRACE OF THIS REMARKABLE PLACE BUT TODAY ISOLATION COULD BE ITS DOOM
WadeDavis_2012 YOU 'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS OF THE TAR SANDS THE CONTROVERSY ABOUT THE KEYSTONE AND THE ENBRIDGE PIPELINES BUT THESE ARE JUST ELEMENTS OF A TSUNAMI OF INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT THAT IS SWEEPING ACROSS ALL OF THE WILD COUNTRY OF NORTHERN CANADA
WadeDavis_2012 IN TAHLTAN TERRITORY ALONE THERE ARE FORTY ONE MAJOR INDUSTRIAL PROPOSALS SOME WITH GREAT PROMISE SOME OF GREAT CONCERN ON TODAGIN MOUNTAIN

WadeDavis_2012 OF THE TAR SANDS
WadeDavis_2012 FOR OVER A DECADE THE TAHLTAN PEOPLE BOTH CLANS WOLF AND CROW HAVE RESISTED THIS ASSAULT ON THEIR HOMELAND MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF ALL AGES
