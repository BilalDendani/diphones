DanCohen_2013X ACADEMIC AS HE SAID AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT
DanCohen_2013X I ARGUE IT 'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF MY LIFE AND I LIKE TO ARGUE AND I 'M NOT JUST AN ACADEMIC I 'M A PHILOSOPHER SO I LIKE TO THINK THAT I 'M ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD AT ARGUING BUT I ALSO LIKE TO THINK A LOT ABOUT ARGUING AND THINKING ABOUT ARGUING I 'VE COME ACROSS SOME PUZZLES AND ONE OF THE PUZZLES IS THAT
DanCohen_2013X AS I 'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT ARGUING OVER THE YEARS AND IT 'S BEEN DECADES NOW
DanCohen_2013X BUT THE MORE THAT I ARGUE AND THE BETTER I GET AT ARGUING THE MORE THAT I LOSE
DanCohen_2013X WHY IS IT THAT I 'M OKAY WITH LOSING AND WHY IS IT THAT I THINK THAT GOOD ARGUERS ARE ACTUALLY BETTER AT LOSING
DanCohen_2013X WHOSE TURN IT IS TO DO THE DISHES OR WHO HAS TO TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE YEAH WE HAVE THOSE ARGUMENTS TOO I TEND TO WIN THOSE ARGUMENTS BECAUSE I KNOW THE TRICKS BUT THOSE AREN 'T THE IMPORTANT ARGUMENTS I 'M INTERESTED IN ACADEMIC ARGUMENTS TODAY AND HERE ARE THE THINGS THAT PUZZLE ME
DanCohen_2013X WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME WHETHER YOU HAVE THIS IDEA THAT KANT 'S THEORY WORKS OR MILL 'S THE RIGHT ETHICIST TO FOLLOW
DanCohen_2013X IT 'S NO SKIN OFF MY BACK WHETHER YOU THINK FUNCTIONALISM IS A VIABLE THEORY OF MIND
DanCohen_2013X SO WHY DO WE EVEN TRY TO ARGUE WHY DO WE TRY TO CONVINCE OTHER PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THINGS THAT THEY DON 'T WANT TO BELIEVE
DanCohen_2013X THAT 'S NOT REALLY A VERY HELPFUL MODEL FOR ARGUING BUT IT 'S A PRETTY COMMON AND ENTRENCHED MODEL FOR ARGUING BUT THERE 'S A SECOND MODEL FOR ARGUING ARGUMENTS AS PROOFS THINK OF A MATHEMATICIAN 'S ARGUMENT HERE 'S MY ARGUMENT DOES IT WORK IS IT ANY GOOD ARE THE PREMISES WARRANTED ARE THE INFERENCES VALID DOES THE CONCLUSION FOLLOW FROM THE PREMISES
DanCohen_2013X BUT THERE 'S ANOTHER TWIST ON THIS MODEL THAT I REALLY THINK IS IMPORTANT NAMELY THAT WHEN WE ARGUE
DanCohen_2013X BEFORE AN AUDIENCE SOMETIMES THE AUDIENCE HAS A MORE
DanCohen_2013X THE ARGUMENT AS WAR IS THE DOMINANT ONE
DanCohen_2013X IT DOMINATES HOW WE TALK ABOUT ARGUMENTS IT DOMINATES HOW WE THINK ABOUT ARGUMENTS AND BECAUSE OF THAT IT SHAPES
DanCohen_2013X IT IS THE DOMINANT WAY OF THINKING ABOUT ARGUMENTS WHEN I 'M TALKING ABOUT ARGUMENTS THAT 'S PROBABLY WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF THE ADVERSARIAL MODEL
DanCohen_2013X FIRST IT ELEVATES TACTICS OVER SUBSTANCE
DanCohen_2013X IGNOMINIOUS DEFEAT I THINK THOSE ARE DEFORMING EFFECTS AND WORST OF ALL IT SEEMS TO PREVENT THINGS LIKE NEGOTIATION
DanCohen_2013X OR DELIBERATION OR COMPROMISE
DanCohen_2013X AND FINALLY THIS IS REALLY THE WORST THING ARGUMENTS DON 'T SEEM TO GET US ANYWHERE THEY 'RE DEAD ENDS THEY ARE ROUNDABOUTS OR TRAFFIC JAMS OR GRIDLOCK
DanCohen_2013X THEN THERE 'S AN IMPLICIT EQUATION OF
DanCohen_2013X HOW DOES IT APPLY OVER HERE AND YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION
DanCohen_2013X TO MY SATISFACTION AND SO AT THE END OF THE DAY I SAY YOU KNOW WHAT
DanCohen_2013X AND IT 'S NOT JUST ANY BELIEF BUT IT 'S A WELL ARTICULATED EXAMINED
DanCohen_2013X IT 'S A BATTLE TESTED BELIEF
DanCohen_2013X WELL THE WAR METAPHOR SEEMS TO FORCE US INTO SAYING YOU WON EVEN THOUGH I 'M THE ONLY ONE WHO MADE ANY COGNITIVE GAIN WHAT DID YOU GAIN COGNITIVELY
DanCohen_2013X I GAINED AND THERE 'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT PICTURE AND THAT 'S THE PICTURE I REALLY WANT TO CHANGE IF WE CAN
DanCohen_2013X YIELD SOMETHING POSITIVE
DanCohen_2013X WHAT WE NEED IS NEW EXIT STRATEGIES FOR ARGUMENTS
DanCohen_2013X ENTRY APPROACHES TO ARGUMENTS WE NEED TO THINK OF NEW KINDS OF ARGUMENTS
DanCohen_2013X I DON 'T HAVE AN ANSWER BUT I HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS AND HERE 'S MY SUGGESTION
DanCohen_2013X THAT PEOPLE PLAY IN ARGUMENTS THERE 'S THE PROPONENT AND THE OPPONENT
DanCohen_2013X IN AN ADVERSARIAL DIALECTICAL ARGUMENT THERE 'S THE AUDIENCE IN RHETORICAL ARGUMENTS THERE 'S THE REASONER IN ARGUMENTS AS PROOFS
