DanCohen_2013X@13.19:17.95 ACADEMIC AS HE SAID AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT
DanCohen_2013X@18.11:37.39 I ARGUE IT 'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF MY LIFE AND I LIKE TO ARGUE AND I 'M NOT JUST AN ACADEMIC I 'M A PHILOSOPHER SO I LIKE TO THINK THAT I 'M ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD AT ARGUING BUT I ALSO LIKE TO THINK A LOT ABOUT ARGUING AND THINKING ABOUT ARGUING I 'VE COME ACROSS SOME PUZZLES AND ONE OF THE PUZZLES IS THAT
DanCohen_2013X@37.39:40.98 AS I 'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT ARGUING OVER THE YEARS AND IT 'S BEEN DECADES NOW
DanCohen_2013X@43.28:48.29 BUT THE MORE THAT I ARGUE AND THE BETTER I GET AT ARGUING THE MORE THAT I LOSE
DanCohen_2013X@53.13:58.32 WHY IS IT THAT I 'M OKAY WITH LOSING AND WHY IS IT THAT I THINK THAT GOOD ARGUERS ARE ACTUALLY BETTER AT LOSING
DanCohen_2013X@80.72:94.05 WHOSE TURN IT IS TO DO THE DISHES OR WHO HAS TO TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE YEAH WE HAVE THOSE ARGUMENTS TOO I TEND TO WIN THOSE ARGUMENTS BECAUSE I KNOW THE TRICKS BUT THOSE AREN 'T THE IMPORTANT ARGUMENTS I 'M INTERESTED IN ACADEMIC ARGUMENTS TODAY AND HERE ARE THE THINGS THAT PUZZLE ME
DanCohen_2013X@109.54:116.68 WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME WHETHER YOU HAVE THIS IDEA THAT KANT 'S THEORY WORKS OR MILL 'S THE RIGHT ETHICIST TO FOLLOW
DanCohen_2013X@116.99:121.49 IT 'S NO SKIN OFF MY BACK WHETHER YOU THINK FUNCTIONALISM IS A VIABLE THEORY OF MIND
DanCohen_2013X@122:127.86 SO WHY DO WE EVEN TRY TO ARGUE WHY DO WE TRY TO CONVINCE OTHER PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THINGS THAT THEY DON 'T WANT TO BELIEVE
DanCohen_2013X@148.48:168.35 THAT 'S NOT REALLY A VERY HELPFUL MODEL FOR ARGUING BUT IT 'S A PRETTY COMMON AND ENTRENCHED MODEL FOR ARGUING BUT THERE 'S A SECOND MODEL FOR ARGUING ARGUMENTS AS PROOFS THINK OF A MATHEMATICIAN 'S ARGUMENT HERE 'S MY ARGUMENT DOES IT WORK IS IT ANY GOOD ARE THE PREMISES WARRANTED ARE THE INFERENCES VALID DOES THE CONCLUSION FOLLOW FROM THE PREMISES
DanCohen_2013X@190.92:196.53 BUT THERE 'S ANOTHER TWIST ON THIS MODEL THAT I REALLY THINK IS IMPORTANT NAMELY THAT WHEN WE ARGUE
DanCohen_2013X@197.11:200.38 BEFORE AN AUDIENCE SOMETIMES THE AUDIENCE HAS A MORE
DanCohen_2013X@231.56:233.9 THE ARGUMENT AS WAR IS THE DOMINANT ONE
DanCohen_2013X@234.24:240.96 IT DOMINATES HOW WE TALK ABOUT ARGUMENTS IT DOMINATES HOW WE THINK ABOUT ARGUMENTS AND BECAUSE OF THAT IT SHAPES
DanCohen_2013X@260.97:267.56 IT IS THE DOMINANT WAY OF THINKING ABOUT ARGUMENTS WHEN I 'M TALKING ABOUT ARGUMENTS THAT 'S PROBABLY WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF THE ADVERSARIAL MODEL
DanCohen_2013X@276.89:280.08 FIRST IT ELEVATES TACTICS OVER SUBSTANCE
DanCohen_2013X@301.47:308.78 IGNOMINIOUS DEFEAT I THINK THOSE ARE DEFORMING EFFECTS AND WORST OF ALL IT SEEMS TO PREVENT THINGS LIKE NEGOTIATION
DanCohen_2013X@308.79:312.16 OR DELIBERATION OR COMPROMISE
DanCohen_2013X@329.11:338.13 AND FINALLY THIS IS REALLY THE WORST THING ARGUMENTS DON 'T SEEM TO GET US ANYWHERE THEY 'RE DEAD ENDS THEY ARE ROUNDABOUTS OR TRAFFIC JAMS OR GRIDLOCK
DanCohen_2013X@348.59:350.65 THEN THERE 'S AN IMPLICIT EQUATION OF
DanCohen_2013X@372.23:375.35 HOW DOES IT APPLY OVER HERE AND YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION
DanCohen_2013X@384.07:389.28 TO MY SATISFACTION AND SO AT THE END OF THE DAY I SAY YOU KNOW WHAT
DanCohen_2013X@394.63:400.44 AND IT 'S NOT JUST ANY BELIEF BUT IT 'S A WELL ARTICULATED EXAMINED
DanCohen_2013X@400.54:402.83 IT 'S A BATTLE TESTED BELIEF
DanCohen_2013X@407.4:416.25 WELL THE WAR METAPHOR SEEMS TO FORCE US INTO SAYING YOU WON EVEN THOUGH I 'M THE ONLY ONE WHO MADE ANY COGNITIVE GAIN WHAT DID YOU GAIN COGNITIVELY
DanCohen_2013X@435.54:442.4 I GAINED AND THERE 'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT PICTURE AND THAT 'S THE PICTURE I REALLY WANT TO CHANGE IF WE CAN
DanCohen_2013X@446.72:448.74 YIELD SOMETHING POSITIVE
DanCohen_2013X@449.45:452.69 WHAT WE NEED IS NEW EXIT STRATEGIES FOR ARGUMENTS
DanCohen_2013X@457.73:462.46 ENTRY APPROACHES TO ARGUMENTS WE NEED TO THINK OF NEW KINDS OF ARGUMENTS
DanCohen_2013X@479.44:485.24 I DON 'T HAVE AN ANSWER BUT I HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS AND HERE 'S MY SUGGESTION
DanCohen_2013X@497.5:501.61 THAT PEOPLE PLAY IN ARGUMENTS THERE 'S THE PROPONENT AND THE OPPONENT
DanCohen_2013X@502:508.88 IN AN ADVERSARIAL DIALECTICAL ARGUMENT THERE 'S THE AUDIENCE IN RHETORICAL ARGUMENTS THERE 'S THE REASONER IN ARGUMENTS AS PROOFS
