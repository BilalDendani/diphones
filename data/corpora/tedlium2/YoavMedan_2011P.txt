YoavMedan_2011P@16.33:27.63 THE LAST THIRTEEN YEARS ONE THREE THIRTEEN YEARS I 'VE BEEN PART OF AN EXCEPTIONAL TEAM AT INSIGHTEC IN ISRAEL AND PARTNERS AROUND THE WORLD FOR TAKING THIS IDEA THIS CONCEPT
YoavMedan_2011P@27.91:31.11 NONINVASIVE SURGERY FROM THE RESEARCH LAB
YoavMedan_2011P@31.4:36.05 TO ROUTINE CLINICAL USE AND THIS IS WHAT I 'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THIRTEEN YEARS
YoavMedan_2011P@36.08:43.71 FOR SOME OF YOU YOU CAN EMPATHIZE WITH THAT NUMBER FOR ME TODAY ON THIS DATE IT 'S LIKE A SECOND BAR MITZVAH EXPERIENCE
YoavMedan_2011P@48.88:63.49 THIS DREAM IS REALLY ENABLED BY THE CONVERGENCE OF TWO KNOWN TECHNOLOGIES ONE IS THE FOCUSED ULTRASOUND AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE VISION ENABLED MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
YoavMedan_2011P@73.19:78.91 IT IS TRANSPARENT MADE JUST FOR YOU SO YOU SEE IT 'S ALL INTACT
YoavMedan_2011P@79.69:99.03 COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT I 'LL TAKE YOU NOW TO THE ACOUSTIC LAB YOU SEE THE PHANTOM WITHIN THE AQUARIUM THIS IS A SETUP I PUT IN A PHYSICS LAB ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE YOU SEE AN ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCER SO THE ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCER EMITS BASICALLY AN ULTRASONIC BEAM THAT FOCUSES
YoavMedan_2011P@99.22:103.12 INSIDE THE PHANTOM OKAY WHEN YOU HEAR THE CLICK
YoavMedan_2011P@104.62:119.92 THIS IS WHEN THE ENERGY STARTS TO EMIT AND YOU SEE A LITTLE LESION FORM INSIDE THE PHANTOM OKAY SO EVERYTHING AROUND IT IS WHOLE AND INTACT IT 'S JUST A LESION FORMED INSIDE SO THINK ABOUT
YoavMedan_2011P@119.92:130.58 THIS IS IN YOUR BRAIN WE NEED TO REACH A TARGET INSIDE THE BRAIN WE CAN DO IT WITHOUT HARMING ANY TISSUE SO THIS IS I THINK THE FIRST KOSHER HIPPOCRATIC
YoavMedan_2011P@130.58:135.45 SURGICAL SYSTEM LAUGHTER OKAY SO LET 'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
YoavMedan_2011P@137.77:155.37 YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IMAGING RIGHT ULTRASOUND IMAGING AND YOU KNOW ALSO ABOUT LITHOTRIPSY BREAKING KIDNEY STONES BUT ULTRASOUND CAN BE SHAPED TO BE ANYTHING IN BETWEEN BECAUSE IT 'S A MECHANICAL
YoavMedan_2011P@155.37:159.78 FORCE BASICALLY IT 'S A FORCE ACTING ON A TISSUE THAT IT TRANSVERSES
YoavMedan_2011P@159.78:177.03 SO YOU CAN CHANGE THE INTENSITY THE FREQUENCY THE DURATION THE PULSE SHAPE OF THE ULTRASOUND TO CREATE ANYTHING FROM AN AIRBRUSH TO A HAMMER AND I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS IN THE MEDICAL FIELD THAT CAN BE ENABLED
YoavMedan_2011P@181.72:192.25 SO THIS IDEA OF HARNESSING FOCUSED ULTRASOUND TO TREAT LESIONS IN THE BRAIN IS NOT NEW AT ALL WHEN I WAS BORN THIS IDEA WAS ALREADY CONCEIVED
YoavMedan_2011P@192.25:206.67 BY PIONEERS SUCH AS THE FRY BROTHERS AND LARS LEKSELL WHO IS KNOW ACTUALLY AS THE INVENTOR OF THE GAMMAKNIFE BUT YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT HE TRIED TO PERFORM LOBOTOMIES IN THE BRAIN NONINVASIVELY
YoavMedan_2011P@214.01:220.11 AND IT MAKES YOU PONDER WHY THOSE PIONEERS FAILED
YoavMedan_2011P@220.55:240.14 AND THERE WAS SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL THAT THEY WERE MISSING THEY WERE MISSING THE VISION IT WASN 'T UNTIL THE INVENTION OF THE MR AND REALLY THE INTEGRATION OF MR WITH FOCUSED ULTRASOUND THAT WE COULD GET THE FEEDBACK BOTH THE ANATOMICAL AND THE PHYSIOLOGICAL
YoavMedan_2011P@240.16:255.43 IN ORDER TO HAVE A COMPLETELY NONINVASIVE CLOSED LOOP SURGICAL PROCEDURE SO THIS IS HOW IT LOOKS YOU KNOW THE OPERATING ROOM OF THE FUTURE TODAY THIS IS AN MR SUITE WITH A FOCUSED ULTRASOUND SYSTEM
YoavMedan_2011P@255.43:263.45 AND I WILL GIVE YOU SEVERAL EXAMPLES SO THE FIRST ONE IS IN THE BRAIN ONE OF THE NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS THAT CAN BE TREATED WITH FOCUSED ULTRASOUND
YoavMedan_2011P@287.52:290.08 AND BE REALLY INDEPENDENT IN YOUR LIFE
YoavMedan_2011P@290.21:292.8 WITHOUT THE HELP OF OTHERS
YoavMedan_2011P@292.85:295.03 SO I 'D LIKE YOU TO MEET JOHN
YoavMedan_2011P@295.74:302.68 JOHN IS A RETIRED PROFESSOR OF HISTORY FROM VIRGINIA SO HE SUFFERED FROM ESSENTIAL TREMOR FOR MANY YEARS
YoavMedan_2011P@303.02:316.47 AND MEDICATION DIDN 'T HELP HIM ANYMORE AND MANY OF THOSE PATIENTS REFUSED TO UNDERGO SURGERY TO HAVE PEOPLE CUT INTO THEIR BRAIN AND ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS AGO HE
YoavMedan_2011P@348.85:355.97 SO NOW I 'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH WHAT A TYPICAL PROCEDURE LIKE THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT NONINVASIVE SURGERY LOOKS LIKE
YoavMedan_2011P@357.47:367.68 SO WE PUT THE PATIENT ON THE MR TABLE WE ATTACH A TRANSDUCER IN THIS CASE TO THE BRAIN BUT IF IT WILL BE A DIFFERENT ORGAN IT WILL BE A DIFFERENT TRANSDUCER ATTACHED TO THE PATIENT
YoavMedan_2011P@381.4:397.21 THIS IS THE SORT OF GENERAL AREA OF THE TREATMENT IT 'S A SAFETY BOUNDARY AROUND THE TARGET IT 'S A TARGET IN THE THALAMUS SO ONCE THOSE PICTURES ARE ACQUIRED AND THE PHYSICIAN HAS DRAWN ALL THE NECESSARY SAFETY LIMITS AND SO ON
YoavMedan_2011P@408.34:426.49 INJECTING THE ENERGY WE CALL IT SONICATION THE ONLY HANDWORK THE PHYSICIAN DOES HERE IS MOVING A MOUSE THIS IS THE ONLY DEVICE HE NEEDS IN THIS TREATMENT SO HE PRESSES SONICATE AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS YOU SEE THE TRANSDUCER THE LIGHT BLUE THERE 'S WATER IN BETWEEN THE SKULL AND THE TRANSDUCER
YoavMedan_2011P@426.9:431.04 AND IT DOES THIS BURST OF ENERGY IT ELEVATES THE TEMPERATURE
YoavMedan_2011P@454.38:459.71 OF THE MR IT IS NOT BEING USED IN REGULAR DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING
YoavMedan_2011P@459.71:467.59 BUT HERE WE CAN GET BOTH THE ANATOMICAL IMAGING AND THE TEMPERATURE MAPS IN REAL TIME AND YOU CAN SEE THE POINTS THERE ON THE GRAPH
YoavMedan_2011P@467.59:483.59 THE TEMPERATURE WAS RAISED TO FORTY THREE DEGREES C TEMPORARILY THIS DOESN 'T CAUSE ANY DAMAGE BUT THE POINT IS WE ARE RIGHT ON TARGET SO ONCE THE PHYSICIAN VERIFIES THAT THE FOCUS SPOT IS ON THE TARGET HE HAS CHOSEN THEN WE MOVE
YoavMedan_2011P@483.59:493.5 TO PERFORM A FULL ENERGY ABLATION LIKE YOU SEE HERE AND YOU SEE THE TEMPERATURE RISES TO LIKE FIFTY FIVE TO SIXTY DEGREES
YoavMedan_2011P@532.66:541.72 AND THIS IS A QUOTE FROM JOHN AFTER HE WROTE IT HE SAID MIRACULOUS AND HIS WIFE SAID THIS IS THE HAPPIEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE
YoavMedan_2011P@542.21:553.82 AND YOU WONDER WHY I MEAN ONE OF THE MESSAGES I LIKE TO CARRY OVER IS WHAT ABOUT DEFENDING QUALITY OF LIFE I MEAN THOSE PEOPLE LOSE THEIR INDEPENDENCE THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON OTHERS
YoavMedan_2011P@570.06:571.58 SO YOU CAN SEE HERE
YoavMedan_2011P@580.17:592.41 THERE 'S NO RECOVERY NEEDED NO NOTHING HE 'S BACK TO HIS NORMAL LIFE LET 'S MOVE NOW TO A MORE PAINFUL SUBJECT PAIN IS SOMETHING THAT CAN MAKE YOUR LIFE MISERABLE
YoavMedan_2011P@592.67:595.55 AND PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING FROM ALL KINDS OF PAIN LIKE
YoavMedan_2011P@606.43:620.21 VERY PAINFUL ALL THOSE I 'VE INDICATED HAVE ALREADY BEEN SHOWN TO BE SUCCESSFULLY TREATED BY FOCUSED ULTRASOUND RELIEVING THE PAIN AGAIN VERY FAST AND
YoavMedan_2011P@620.21:623.22 I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT
YoavMedan_2011P@626.2:645.66 HE 'S A SEVENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD FARMER WHO SUFFERED FROM HOW SHOULD I SAY IT IT 'S CALLED PAIN IN THE BUTT HE HAD METASTASES IN HIS RIGHT BUTTOCK AND HE COULDN 'T SIT EVEN WITH MEDICATION HE HAD TO FORGO ALL THE FARM ACTIVITIES
YoavMedan_2011P@648.29:662.87 HE WAS TREATED WITH RADIATION THERAPY STATE OF THE ART RADIATION THERAPY BUT IT DIDN 'T HELP MANY PATIENTS LIKE THAT FAVOR RADIATION THERAPY AND AGAIN HE VOLUNTEERED TO A PIVOTAL STUDY THAT
YoavMedan_2011P@666.47:668.1 AND
YoavMedan_2011P@668.11:676.92 HIS WIFE ACTUALLY TOOK HIM THEY DROVE LIKE THREE HOURS FROM THEIR FARM TO THE HOSPITAL
YoavMedan_2011P@683.64:685.69 HE TOOK THE TREATMENT
YoavMedan_2011P@693.39:702.11 SO AGAIN THIS IS AN IMMEDIATE RELIEF AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE PEOPLE FEEL AND WHAT THEIR FAMILY
YoavMedan_2011P@705.19:714.19 HE RETURNED AGAIN TO HIS DAILY ROUTINE ON THE FARM HE RIDES HIS TRACTOR HE RIDES HIS HORSE TO THEIR MOUNTAIN CABIN
YoavMedan_2011P@714.19:719.13 REGULARLY AND HE HAS BEEN VERY HAPPY
YoavMedan_2011P@719.13:736.87 BUT NOW YOU ASK ME BUT WHAT ABOUT WAR THE WAR ON CANCER SHOW US SOME PRIMARY CANCER WHAT CAN BE DONE THERE SO I HAVE GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS THE GOOD NEWS THERE 'S A LOT THAT CAN BE DONE AND IT HAS BEEN SHOWN ACTUALLY OUTSIDE OF THE U S
YoavMedan_2011P@736.87:746.23 AND DOING THAT IN THE U S IS VERY PAINFUL I DON 'T SEE WITHOUT THIS NATION
YoavMedan_2011P@788.19:795.97 THE ADVERSE EVENT TRAIT IN PROSTATE CANCER THERE IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY NOW WITH FOCUSED ULTRASOUND GUIDED BY
YoavMedan_2011P@796.46:799.7 BECAUSE WE CAN ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT
YoavMedan_2011P@813.03:815.82 WELL
YoavMedan_2011P@824.11:836.47 THE CHALLENGE THERE WITH A BREATHING AND AWAKE PATIENT AND IN ALL OUR TREATMENTS THE PATIENT IS AWAKE AND CONSCIOUS AND SPEAKS WITH THE PHYSICIAN
YoavMedan_2011P@836.63:845 IS YOU HAVE TO TEACH THE MR SOME TRICKS HOW TO DO IT IN REAL TIME AND
YoavMedan_2011P@845:858.08 THIS WILL TAKE TIME THIS WILL TAKE TWO YEARS BUT I HAVE NOW A MESSAGE TO THE LADIES AND THIS IS IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR THE FDA HAS APPROVED MR GUIDED FOCUSED ULTRASOUNDS FOR THE TREATMENT OF SYMPTOMATIC
YoavMedan_2011P@880.09:897.62 SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A GRAPEFRUIT SIZED FIBROID THIS IS A BIG FIBROID SHE WAS OFFERED A HYSTERECTOMY BUT THIS IS AN INCONCEIVABLE PROPOSITION FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO KEEP HER PREGNANCY OPTION SO SHE ELECTED TO UNDERGO A FOCUSED ULTRASOUND PROCEDURE IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
YoavMedan_2011P@897.65:903.39 AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN SHE BECAME A FIRST TIME MOTHER TO A HEALTHY BABY SO NEW LIFE WAS
YoavMedan_2011P@908.6:919.8 I 'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH ACTUALLY FOUR MESSAGES ONE IS THINK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF SUFFERING THAT IS SAVED FROM PATIENTS UNDERGOING NONINVASIVE SURGERY
YoavMedan_2011P@920.03:930.02 AND ALSO THE ECONOMICAL AND EMOTIONAL BURDEN REMOVED FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES AND THE SOCIETY AT LARGE
YoavMedan_2011P@930.02:932.91 AND
YoavMedan_2011P@932.91:936.38 I THINK ALSO FROM THEIR PHYSICIANS BY THE WAY
YoavMedan_2011P@952.31:960.36 THE PATIENT HOLDS A STOP SONICATION BUTTON HE CAN STOP THE SURGERY AT ANY MOMENT AND
