RaghavaKK_2011G@54.15:55.83 YOU CAN DRAW
RaghavaKK_2011G@55.87:75.46 AS EVERYONE SHOULD BUT YOU KNOW I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH CHILDREN 'S BOOKS I THINK THEY 'RE FULL OF PROPAGANDA AT LEAST AN INDIAN TRYING TO GET ONE OF THESE AMERICAN BOOKS IN PARK SLOPE FORGET IT IT 'S NOT THE WAY I WAS BROUGHT UP SO I SAID I 'M GOING TO COUNTER THIS WITH MY OWN PROPAGANDA IF YOU NOTICE CAREFULLY IT 'S A HOMOSEXUAL COUPLE BRINGING UP A CHILD

RaghavaKK_2011G@83.25:86.01 AND YOU HAVE A HETEROSEXUAL COUPLE
RaghavaKK_2011G@86.01:101.36 YOU KNOW I DON 'T EVEN BELIEVE IN THE CONCEPT OF AN IDEAL FAMILY I HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD I WENT TO THIS VERY PROPER CHRISTIAN SCHOOL TAUGHT BY NUNS FATHERS BROTHERS SISTERS BASICALLY I WAS BROUGHT UP TO BE A GOOD SAMARITAN AND I AM
RaghavaKK_2011G@101.36:109.4 AND I 'D GO AT THE END OF THE DAY TO A TRADITIONAL HINDU HOUSE WHICH WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY HINDU HOUSE IN A PREDOMINANTLY ISLAMIC NEIGHBORHOOD
RaghavaKK_2011G@109.4:124.17 BASICALLY I CELEBRATED EVERY RELIGIOUS FUNCTION IN FACT WHEN THERE WAS A WEDDING IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD ALL OF US WOULD PAINT OUR HOUSES FOR THE WEDDING I REMEMBER WE CRIED PROFUSELY WHEN THE LITTLE GOATS WE PLAYED WITH IN THE SUMMER BECAME BIRIANI
RaghavaKK_2011G@126.39:129.67 WE ALL HAD TO FAST DURING RAMADAN IT WAS
RaghavaKK_2011G@148.57:161.97 I WAS AFFECTED BY THIS COMMUNAL UNREST MY LITTLE FIVE YEAR OLD KID NEIGHBOR COMES RUNNING IN AND HE SAYS RAGS RAGS YOU KNOW THE HINDUS ARE KILLING US MUSLIMS BE CAREFUL
RaghavaKK_2011G@178.96:197.31 DISTILL ONLY ITS EMOTIONAL RESIDUE AND IMAGE MY OWN LIFE IMAGINE HISTORY BEING TAUGHT DIFFERENTLY REMEMBER THAT CHILDREN 'S BOOK WHERE YOU SHAKE AND THE SEXUALITY OF THE PARENTS CHANGE I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA IT 'S A CHILDREN 'S BOOK ABOUT INDIAN INDEPENDENCE VERY PATRIOTIC BUT WHEN YOU SHAKE IT YOU GET PAKISTAN 'S PERSPECTIVE
RaghavaKK_2011G@217.21:222.91 YOU KNOW I 'M MAKING A VERY IMPORTANT ARGUMENT AND MY ARGUMENT IS THAT THE ONLY WAY
RaghavaKK_2011G@222.91:238.51 FOR US TO TEACH CREATIVITY IS BY TEACHING CHILDREN PERSPECTIVES AT THE EARLIEST STAGE AFTER ALL CHILDREN 'S BOOKS ARE MANUALS ON PARENTING SO YOU BETTER GIVE THEM CHILDREN 'S BOOKS THAT TEACH THEM PERSPECTIVES AND CONVERSELY ONLY WHEN YOU TEACH PERSPECTIVES
RaghavaKK_2011G@238.51:243.68 WILL A CHILD BE ABLE TO IMAGINE AND PUT THEMSELVES IN THE SHOES OF SOMEONE WHO IS DIFFERENT
RaghavaKK_2011G@243.68:253.49 FROM THEM I 'M MAKING AN ARGUMENT THAT ART AND CREATIVITY ARE VERY ESSENTIAL TOOLS IN EMPATHY YOU KNOW I CAN 'T PROMISE MY CHILD A LIFE WITHOUT BIAS
