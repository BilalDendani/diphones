ElizabethLesser_2010W THIS ROOM MAY APPEAR TO BE HOLDING SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY SO MANY MORE BECAUSE IN EACH ONE OF US THERE IS A MULTITUDE OF PERSONALITIES
ElizabethLesser_2010W PRIMARY PERSONALITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IN CONFLICT AND CONVERSATION WITHIN ME SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL I CALL THEM THE MYSTIC AND THE WARRIOR
ElizabethLesser_2010W I WAS BORN INTO A FAMILY OF POLITICALLY ACTIVE INTELLECTUAL ATHEISTS THERE WAS THIS EQUATION IN MY FAMILY THAT WENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS
ElizabethLesser_2010W IF YOU ARE INTELLIGENT YOU THEREFORE ARE NOT SPIRITUAL I WAS THE FREAK OF THE FAMILY I WAS THIS WEIRD LITTLE KID WHO WANTED TO HAVE DEEP TALKS
ElizabethLesser_2010W THAT MIGHT EXIST BEYOND THE ONES THAT WE PERCEIVE WITH OUR SENSES I WANTED TO KNOW IF WHAT WE HUMAN BEINGS SEE AND HEAR
ElizabethLesser_2010W AND THINK IS A FULL AND ACCURATE PICTURE OF REALITY SO LOOKING FOR ANSWERS
ElizabethLesser_2010W I WENT TO CATHOLIC MASS I TAGGED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS I READ SARTRE AND SOCRATES AND THEN A WONDERFUL THING HAPPENED WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL
ElizabethLesser_2010W GURUS FROM THE EAST STARTED WASHING UP ON THE SHORES OF AMERICA AND I SAID TO MYSELF I WANNA GET ME ONE OF THEM
ElizabethLesser_2010W EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN WALKING THE MYSTIC PATH
ElizabethLesser_2010W TRYING TO PEER BEYOND WHAT ALBERT EINSTEIN CALLED THE OPTICAL DELUSION OF EVERYDAY CONSCIOUSNESS
ElizabethLesser_2010W SO WHAT DID HE MEAN BY THIS I'LL SHOW YOU
ElizabethLesser_2010W TAKE A BREATH RIGHT NOW
ElizabethLesser_2010W OF THIS CLEAR AIR IN THIS ROOM
ElizabethLesser_2010W NOW SEE THIS STRANGE UNDERWATER
ElizabethLesser_2010W CORAL REEF LOOKING THING
ElizabethLesser_2010W IT'S ACTUALLY A PERSON 'S TRACHEA
ElizabethLesser_2010W AND THOSE COLORED GLOBS ARE MICROBES THAT ARE ACTUALLY SWIMMING AROUND IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW ALL AROUND US
ElizabethLesser_2010W IF WE'RE BLIND TO THIS SIMPLE BIOLOGY IMAGINE WHAT WE'RE MISSING
ElizabethLesser_2010W AT THE SMALLEST SUBATOMIC LEVEL RIGHT NOW AND AT THE GRANDEST COSMIC LEVELS MY YEARS
ElizabethLesser_2010W AS A MYSTIC HAVE MADE ME QUESTION ALMOST ALL MY ASSUMPTIONS THEY'VE MADE ME A PROUD I DON 'T KNOW IT ALL
ElizabethLesser_2010W NOW WHEN THE MYSTIC PART OF ME JABBERS ON AND ON LIKE THIS THE WARRIOR ROLLS HER EYES SHE'S
ElizabethLesser_2010W WORRIED SHE SAYS EXCUSE ME I'M PISSED OFF AND I KNOW A FEW THINGS AND WE BETTER GET BUSY ABOUT THEM RIGHT NOW
ElizabethLesser_2010W SPENT MY LIFE AS A WARRIOR WORKING FOR WOMEN 'S ISSUES WORKING ON POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS BEING AN ACTIVIST FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
ElizabethLesser_2010W AND IT CAN BE SORT OF CRAZY MAKING HOUSING BOTH THE MYSTIC AND THE WARRIOR IN ONE BODY I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ATTRACTED TO THOSE RARE PEOPLE
ElizabethLesser_2010W WHO PULL THAT OFF
ElizabethLesser_2010W DEVOTE THEIR LIVES TO HUMANITY WITH THE GRIT OF THE WARRIOR AND THE GRACE OF THE MYSTIC
ElizabethLesser_2010W PEOPLE LIKE MARTIN LUTHER KING JR WHO WROTE I CAN NEVER BE WHAT I OUGHT TO BE UNTIL YOU ARE
ElizabethLesser_2010W WHAT YOU OUGHT TO BE THIS HE WROTE IS THE INTERRELATED STRUCTURE OF REALITY
ElizabethLesser_2010W THEN MOTHER TERESA ANOTHER MYSTIC WARRIOR WHO SAID THE PROBLEM WITH THE WORLD IS THAT WE DRAW THE CIRCLE OF OUR FAMILY TOO SMALL
ElizabethLesser_2010W AND NELSON MANDELA WHO LIVES BY THE AFRICAN CONCEPT OF UBUNTU WHICH MEANS I NEED YOU
ElizabethLesser_2010W IN ORDER TO BE ME AND YOU NEED ME IN ORDER TO BE YOU NOW WE ALL LOVE TO TROT OUT THESE THREE MYSTIC WARRIORS AS IF
ElizabethLesser_2010W THEY WERE BORN WITH THE SAINT GENE BUT WE ALL ACTUALLY HAVE THE SAME CAPACITY THAT THEY DO
ElizabethLesser_2010W AND WE NEED TO DO THEIR WORK NOW
ElizabethLesser_2010W DEEPLY DISTURBED BY THE WAYS IN WHICH ALL OF OUR CULTURES ARE DEMONIZING THE OTHER
ElizabethLesser_2010W BY THE VOICE WE'RE GIVING TO THE MOST DIVISIVE AMONG US LISTEN TO THESE TITLES OF SOME OF THE BEST SELLING BOOKS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE POLITICAL DIVIDE HERE IN THE U S
ElizabethLesser_2010W IS A BIG FAT IDIOT
ElizabethLesser_2010W AND PATRIOTS
ElizabethLesser_2010W ARGUING WITH IDIOTS THEY'RE SUPPOSEDLY TONGUE IN CHEEK
ElizabethLesser_2010W BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DANGEROUS
ElizabethLesser_2010W NOW HERE 'S A TITLE THAT MAY SOUND FAMILIAR BUT WHOSE AUTHOR MAY SURPRISE YOU
ElizabethLesser_2010W FOUR AND A HALF YEARS OF STRUGGLE AGAINST LIES STUPIDITY AND COWARDICE WHO WROTE THAT
ElizabethLesser_2010W THAT WAS ADOLF HITLER 'S FIRST TITLE FOR MEIN KAMPF MY STRUGGLE THE BOOK THAT LAUNCHED THE NAZI PARTY
ElizabethLesser_2010W THE WORST ERAS IN HUMAN HISTORY WHETHER IN CAMBODIA OR GERMANY OR RWANDA THEY START LIKE THIS WITH NEGATIVE OTHERIZING AND THEN THEY MORPH
ElizabethLesser_2010W INTO VIOLENT EXTREMISM
ElizabethLesser_2010W THIS IS WHY I'M LAUNCHING A NEW INITIATIVE AND IT'S TO
ElizabethLesser_2010W ALL OF US MYSELF INCLUDED TO COUNTERACT
ElizabethLesser_2010W THE TENDENCY TO
ElizabethLesser_2010W AND I REALIZE WE'RE ALL BUSY PEOPLE SO DON'T WORRY YOU CAN DO THIS ON A LUNCH BREAK
ElizabethLesser_2010W I'M CALLING MY INITIATIVE TAKE THE OTHER TO LUNCH IF YOU ARE
ElizabethLesser_2010W YOU CAN TAKE A DEMOCRAT TO LUNCH OR IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT THINK OF IT AS TAKING A REPUBLICAN TO LUNCH
ElizabethLesser_2010W NOW IF THE IDEA OF TAKING ANY OF THESE PEOPLE TO LUNCH MAKES YOU LOSE YOUR APPETITE
ElizabethLesser_2010W I SUGGEST YOU START MORE LOCAL BECAUSE THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF THE OTHER RIGHT IN YOUR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD MAYBE THAT PERSON WHO WORSHIPS AT THE MOSQUE
ElizabethLesser_2010W OR THE CHURCH OR THE SYNAGOGUE DOWN THE STREET OR
ElizabethLesser_2010W I TOOK A CONSERVATIVE TEA PARTY WOMAN TO LUNCH
ElizabethLesser_2010W NOW ON PAPER SHE PASSED MY SMOKING EARS TEST
ElizabethLesser_2010W SHE'S AN ACTIVIST FROM THE RIGHT AND I'M AN ACTIVIST FROM THE LEFT
ElizabethLesser_2010W AND WE USED SOME GUIDELINES TO KEEP OUR CONVERSATION ELEVATED AND YOU CAN USE THEM TOO BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE ALL GOING TO TAKE AN OTHER TO LUNCH
ElizabethLesser_2010W SO FIRST OF ALL DECIDE ON A GOAL TO GET TO KNOW ONE PERSON
ElizabethLesser_2010W FROM A GROUP YOU MAY HAVE NEGATIVELY STEREOTYPED
ElizabethLesser_2010W AND THEN BEFORE YOU GET TOGETHER AGREE ON SOME GROUND RULES MY TEA PARTY LUNCHMATE AND I CAME UP WITH THESE
ElizabethLesser_2010W DON'T PERSUADE DEFEND OR INTERRUPT BE CURIOUS BE CONVERSATIONAL
ElizabethLesser_2010W REAL AND LISTEN
ElizabethLesser_2010W FROM THERE WE DOVE IN AND WE USED THESE QUESTIONS SHARE SOME OF YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCES WITH ME
ElizabethLesser_2010W WHAT ISSUES DEEPLY CONCERN YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO ASK SOMEONE FROM THE OTHER SIDE
ElizabethLesser_2010W MY LUNCH PARTNER AND I CAME AWAY WITH SOME REALLY IMPORTANT INSIGHTS AND I'M GOING TO SHARE JUST ONE WITH YOU I THINK IT HAS RELEVANCE TO ANY
ElizabethLesser_2010W WHY HER SIDE MAKES SUCH OUTRAGEOUS ALLEGATIONS AND LIES ABOUT MY SIDE WHAT SHE WANTED TO KNOW
ElizabethLesser_2010W A BUNCH OF ELITIST MORALLY CORRUPT TERRORIST LOVERS WELL SHE WAS SHOCKED SHE THOUGHT MY SIDE BEAT UP ON HER SIDE WAY MORE OFTEN
ElizabethLesser_2010W THAT WE CALLED THEM BRAINLESS GUN TOTING RACISTS
ElizabethLesser_2010W AND WE BOTH MARVELED AT THE LABELS THAT FIT NONE OF THE PEOPLE WE ACTUALLY KNOW
ElizabethLesser_2010W AND SINCE WE HAD ESTABLISHED SOME TRUST WE BELIEVED IN EACH OTHER 'S SINCERITY
ElizabethLesser_2010W WE AGREED WE'D SPEAK UP IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES WHEN WE WITNESSED THE KIND OF OTHERIZING TALK THAT CAN WOUND AND FESTER INTO PARANOIA
ElizabethLesser_2010W AND THEN BE USED BY THOSE ON THE FRINGES TO INCITE
ElizabethLesser_2010W BY THE END OF OUR LUNCH WE ACKNOWLEDGED EACH OTHER 'S OPENNESS NEITHER OF US HAD TRIED TO CHANGE THE
ElizabethLesser_2010W BUT WE ALSO HADN'T PRETENDED THAT OUR DIFFERENCES WERE JUST GOING TO MELT AWAY AFTER A LUNCH
ElizabethLesser_2010W WHICH IS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE SOLUTIONS TO OUR MOST INTRACTABLE SEEMING PROBLEMS
ElizabethLesser_2010W WILL BE FOUND
ElizabethLesser_2010W WHO SHOULD YOU INVITE TO LUNCH NEXT TIME YOU CATCH YOURSELF IN THE ACT OF OTHERIZING THAT WILL BE YOUR CLUE
ElizabethLesser_2010W AND WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN AT YOUR LUNCH WILL THE HEAVENS OPEN AND WE ARE THE WORLD PLAY OVER THE RESTAURANT SOUND SYSTEM PROBABLY NOT
ElizabethLesser_2010W BECAUSE UBUNTU WORK IS SLOW AND IT'S DIFFICULT IT'S TWO PEOPLE
ElizabethLesser_2010W DROPPING THE PRETENSE OF BEING KNOW IT ALLS
ElizabethLesser_2010W IT'S TWO PEOPLE TWO WARRIORS
ElizabethLesser_2010W HERE 'S HOW THE GREAT PERSIAN POET RUMI PUT IT
ElizabethLesser_2010W OUT BEYOND IDEAS OF WRONG DOING AND RIGHT DOING
