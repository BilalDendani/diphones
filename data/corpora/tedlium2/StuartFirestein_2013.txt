StuartFirestein_2013 I FIND THIS A PARTICULARLY APT DESCRIPTION OF SCIENCE AND HOW SCIENCE WORKS
StuartFirestein_2013 BUMBLING AROUND IN A DARK ROOM BUMPING INTO THINGS
StuartFirestein_2013 TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT SHAPE THIS MIGHT BE WHAT THAT MIGHT BE THERE ARE REPORTS OF A CAT SOMEWHERE AROUND THEY MAY NOT BE RELIABLE THEY MAY BE AND SO FORTH AND SO ON NOW I KNOW THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY MOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT SCIENCE
StuartFirestein_2013 SCIENCE WE GENERALLY ARE TOLD IS A VERY WELL ORDERED MECHANISM FOR UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD FOR GAINING FACTS FOR GAINING DATA
StuartFirestein_2013 I 'D LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT 'S NOT THE CASE SO THERE 'S THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD BUT WHAT 'S REALLY GOING ON
StuartFirestein_2013 SO THIS DIFFERENCE FIRST CAME TO ME IN SOME WAYS IN MY DUAL ROLE AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY WHERE I 'M BOTH A PROFESSOR AND RUN A LABORATORY IN NEUROSCIENCE WHERE WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE BRAIN WORKS
StuartFirestein_2013 WE DO THIS BY STUDYING THE SENSE OF SMELL THE SENSE OF OLFACTION AND IN THE LABORATORY IT 'S A GREAT PLEASURE AND FASCINATING WORK AND EXCITING TO WORK WITH GRADUATE STUDENTS AND POST DOCS AND THINK UP COOL EXPERIMENTS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS SENSE OF SMELL WORKS AND HOW THE BRAIN MIGHT BE WORKING AND WELL FRANKLY IT 'S KIND OF EXHILARATING
StuartFirestein_2013 BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT 'S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO TEACH A LARGE COURSE TO UNDERGRADUATES ON THE BRAIN AND THAT 'S A BIG SUBJECT AND IT TAKES QUITE A WHILE TO ORGANIZE THAT
StuartFirestein_2013 AND IT 'S QUITE CHALLENGING AND IT 'S QUITE INTERESTING BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT 'S NOT SO EXHILARATING SO WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE WELL THE COURSE I WAS AND AM TEACHING IS CALLED CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE
StuartFirestein_2013 IT 'S TWENTY FIVE LECTURES FULL OF ALL SORTS OF FACTS IT USES THIS GIANT BOOK CALLED PRINCIPLES OF NEURAL SCIENCE BY THREE FAMOUS NEUROSCIENTISTS THIS BOOK COMES IN AT ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN PAGES
StuartFirestein_2013 IT WEIGHS A HEFTY SEVEN AND A HALF POUNDS JUST TO PUT THAT IN SOME PERSPECTIVE THAT 'S THE WEIGHT OF TWO NORMAL HUMAN BRAINS
StuartFirestein_2013 AND THAT 'S NOT REALLY THE CASE EITHER WHEN I GO TO A MEETING AFTER THE MEETING DAY IS OVER AND WE COLLECT IN THE BAR OVER A COUPLE OF BEERS WITH MY COLLEAGUES WE NEVER TALK ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW
StuartFirestein_2013 WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE DON 'T KNOW WE TALK ABOUT WHAT STILL HAS TO GET DONE WHAT 'S SO CRITICAL TO GET DONE IN THE LAB INDEED THIS WAS I THINK BEST SAID BY MARIE CURIE WHO SAID THAT ONE NEVER NOTICES WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BUT ONLY WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE THIS WAS IN A LETTER TO HER BROTHER AFTER OBTAINING HER SECOND GRADUATE DEGREE I SHOULD SAY
StuartFirestein_2013 NONETHELESS THIS IS WHAT I THINK WE WERE LEAVING OUT
StuartFirestein_2013 OF OUR COURSES AND LEAVING OUT OF THE INTERACTION THAT WE HAVE WITH THE PUBLIC AS SCIENTISTS THE WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE THIS IS THE STUFF THAT 'S EXHILARATING AND INTERESTING IT IS IF YOU WILL THE IGNORANCE THAT 'S WHAT WAS MISSING SO I THOUGHT WELL MAYBE I SHOULD TEACH A COURSE ON IGNORANCE
StuartFirestein_2013 SOMETHING I CAN FINALLY EXCEL AT PERHAPS FOR EXAMPLE SO I DID START TEACHING THIS COURSE ON IGNORANCE AND IT 'S BEEN QUITE INTERESTING AND I 'D LIKE TO TELL YOU TO GO TO THE WEBSITE YOU CAN FIND ALL SORTS OF INFORMATION THERE
StuartFirestein_2013 IT 'S WIDE OPEN AND IT 'S BEEN REALLY QUITE AN INTERESTING TIME FOR ME TO MEET UP WITH OTHER SCIENTISTS WHO COME IN AND TALK ABOUT WHAT IT IS THEY DON 'T KNOW NOW I USE THIS WORD IGNORANCE OF COURSE TO BE AT LEAST IN PART INTENTIONALLY PROVOCATIVE
StuartFirestein_2013 BECAUSE IGNORANCE HAS A LOT OF BAD CONNOTATIONS AND I CLEARLY DON 'T MEAN ANY OF THOSE SO I DON 'T MEAN STUPIDITY I DON 'T MEAN A CALLOW INDIFFERENCE TO FACT OR REASON OR DATA THE IGNORANT ARE CLEARLY UNENLIGHTENED UNAWARE UNINFORMED AND PRESENT COMPANY TODAY EXCEPTED OFTEN OCCUPY ELECTED OFFICES IT SEEMS TO ME
StuartFirestein_2013 THE KIND OF IGNORANCE THAT 'S MAYBE BEST SUMMED UP IN A STATEMENT BY JAMES CLERK MAXWELL PERHAPS THE GREATEST PHYSICIST BETWEEN NEWTON AND EINSTEIN WHO SAID THOROUGHLY CONSCIOUS IGNORANCE IS THE PRELUDE TO EVERY REAL ADVANCE IN SCIENCE
StuartFirestein_2013 SO THAT 'S THE KIND OF IGNORANCE THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY BUT OF COURSE THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO CLEAR UP IS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH ALL THOSE FACTS SO IT IS TRUE THAT SCIENCE PILES UP AT AN ALARMING RATE
StuartFirestein_2013 WE ALL HAVE THIS SENSE THAT SCIENCE IS THIS MOUNTAIN OF FACTS THIS ACCUMULATION MODEL OF SCIENCE AS MANY HAVE CALLED IT AND IT SEEMS IMPREGNABLE IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE HOW CAN YOU EVER KNOW ALL OF THIS AND INDEED THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE GROWS AT AN ALARMING RATE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THERE WERE ONE POINT THREE MILLION PAPERS PUBLISHED
StuartFirestein_2013 THERE 'S ABOUT A TWO AND A HALF PERCENT YEARLY GROWTH RATE AND SO LAST YEAR WE SAW OVER ONE AND A HALF MILLION PAPERS BEING PUBLISHED DIVIDE THAT BY THE NUMBER OF MINUTES IN A YEAR AND YOU WIND UP WITH THREE NEW PAPERS PER MINUTE SO I 'VE BEEN UP HERE A LITTLE OVER TEN MINUTES I 'VE ALREADY LOST THREE PAPERS I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE ACTUALLY I HAVE TO GO READ
StuartFirestein_2013 SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THIS WELL THE FACT IS
StuartFirestein_2013 THAT WHAT SCIENTISTS DO ABOUT IT IS A KIND OF A CONTROLLED
StuartFirestein_2013 NEGLECT IF YOU WILL WE JUST DON 'T WORRY ABOUT IT IN A WAY THE FACTS ARE IMPORTANT YOU HAVE TO KNOW A LOT OF STUFF TO BE A SCIENTIST THAT 'S TRUE BUT KNOWING A LOT OF STUFF DOESN 'T MAKE YOU A SCIENTIST
StuartFirestein_2013 YOU NEED TO KNOW A LOT OF STUFF TO BE A LAWYER OR AN ACCOUNTANT OR AN ELECTRICIAN OR A CARPENTER BUT IN SCIENCE KNOWING A LOT OF STUFF IS NOT THE POINT KNOWING A LOT OF STUFF IS THERE TO HELP YOU GET
StuartFirestein_2013 TO MORE IGNORANCE SO KNOWLEDGE IS A BIG SUBJECT BUT I WOULD SAY IGNORANCE
StuartFirestein_2013 IS A BIGGER ONE SO THIS LEADS US TO MAYBE THINK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE MODELS OF SCIENCE THAT WE TEND TO USE AND I 'D LIKE TO DISABUSE YOU OF SOME OF THEM SO ONE OF THEM
StuartFirestein_2013 A POPULAR ONE IS THAT SCIENTISTS ARE PATIENTLY PUTTING THE PIECES OF A PUZZLE TOGETHER TO REVEAL SOME GRAND SCHEME OR ANOTHER THIS IS CLEARLY NOT TRUE FOR ONE WITH PUZZLES THE MANUFACTURER HAS GUARANTEED THAT THERE 'S A SOLUTION
StuartFirestein_2013 WE DON 'T HAVE ANY SUCH GUARANTEE INDEED THERE ARE MANY OF US WHO AREN 'T SO SURE ABOUT THE MANUFACTURER
StuartFirestein_2013 ANOTHER ONE A KIND OF POPULAR ONE IS THE ICEBERG IDEA THAT WE ONLY SEE THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG BUT UNDERNEATH IS WHERE MOST OF THE ICEBERG IS HIDDEN BUT ALL OF THESE MODELS ARE BASED ON THE IDEA OF A LARGE BODY OF FACTS THAT WE CAN SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER GET COMPLETED WE CAN CHIP AWAY AT THIS ICEBERG AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS OR WE COULD JUST WAIT FOR IT TO MELT I SUPPOSE THESE DAYS BUT
StuartFirestein_2013 ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WE COULD GET TO THE WHOLE ICEBERG RIGHT
StuartFirestein_2013 OR MAKE IT MANAGEABLE BUT I DON 'T THINK THAT 'S THE CASE I THINK WHAT REALLY HAPPENS IN SCIENCE IS A MODEL MORE LIKE THE MAGIC WELL WHERE NO MATTER HOW MANY BUCKETS YOU TAKE OUT THERE 'S ALWAYS ANOTHER BUCKET OF WATER TO BE HAD OR MY PARTICULARLY FAVORITE ONE WITH THE EFFECT AND EVERYTHING THE RIPPLES ON A POND SO IF YOU THINK OF KNOWLEDGE BEING THIS EVER EXPANDING RIPPLE ON A POND
StuartFirestein_2013 THE IMPORTANT THING TO REALIZE IS THAT OUR IGNORANCE THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THIS KNOWLEDGE ALSO GROWS WITH KNOWLEDGE
StuartFirestein_2013 SO THE KNOWLEDGE GENERATES IGNORANCE THIS IS REALLY WELL SAID I THOUGHT BY GEORGE BERNARD SHAW THIS IS ACTUALLY PART OF A TOAST
StuartFirestein_2013 THAT HE DELIVERED TO CELEBRATE EINSTEIN AT A DINNER CELEBRATING EINSTEIN 'S WORK IN WHICH HE CLAIMS THAT SCIENCE I FIND THAT KIND OF GLORIOUS AND I THINK HE 'S PRECISELY RIGHT PLUS IT 'S A KIND OF JOB SECURITY
StuartFirestein_2013 AS IT TURNS OUT HE KIND OF CRIBBED THAT FROM THE PHILOSOPHER IMMANUEL KANT WHO A HUNDRED YEARS EARLIER HAD COME UP WITH THIS IDEA OF QUESTION PROPAGATION THAT EVERY ANSWER BEGETS MORE QUESTIONS I LOVE THAT TERM QUESTION PROPAGATION THIS IDEA OF QUESTIONS PROPAGATING OUT THERE
StuartFirestein_2013 SO I 'D SAY THE MODEL WE WANT TO TAKE IS NOT THAT WE START OUT KIND OF IGNORANT AND WE GET SOME FACTS TOGETHER AND THEN WE GAIN KNOWLEDGE IT 'S RATHER KIND OF THE OTHER WAY AROUND REALLY WHAT DO WE USE THIS KNOWLEDGE FOR WHAT ARE WE USING THIS COLLECTION OF FACTS FOR WE 'RE USING IT
StuartFirestein_2013 TO MAKE BETTER IGNORANCE TO COME UP WITH IF YOU WILL HIGHER QUALITY IGNORANCE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE 'S LOW QUALITY IGNORANCE
StuartFirestein_2013 THIS GRAPH ASKS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WHAT YOU KNOW AND HOW MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT IT SO WHAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN KNOW ANYWHERE FROM NOTHING TO EVERYTHING OF COURSE AND HOW MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT IT CAN BE ANYWHERE FROM A LITTLE TO A LOT
StuartFirestein_2013 SO LET 'S PUT A POINT ON THE GRAPH THERE 'S AN UNDERGRADUATE
StuartFirestein_2013 DOESN 'T KNOW MUCH BUT THEY HAVE A LOT OF INTEREST THEY 'RE INTERESTED IN ALMOST EVERYTHING NOW YOU LOOK AT A MASTER 'S STUDENT A LITTLE FURTHER ALONG IN THEIR EDUCATION AND YOU SEE THEY KNOW A BIT MORE BUT IT 'S BEEN NARROWED SOMEWHAT AND FINALLY YOU GET YOUR PH D WHERE IT TURNS OUT YOU KNOW A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ABOUT ALMOST NOTHING
StuartFirestein_2013 SO THE IMPORTANT THING HERE IS THAT THIS CAN ALL BE CHANGED THIS WHOLE VIEW CAN BE CHANGED BY JUST CHANGING THE LABEL ON THE X AXIS SO INSTEAD OF HOW MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT IT WE COULD SAY WHAT CAN YOU ASK ABOUT IT SO YES YOU DO NEED TO KNOW A LOT OF STUFF AS A SCIENTIST BUT THE PURPOSE OF KNOWING A LOT OF STUFF
StuartFirestein_2013 THOUGHTFUL INTERESTING QUESTIONS BECAUSE THAT 'S WHERE THE REAL WORK IS LET ME GIVE YOU A QUICK IDEA OF A COUPLE OF THESE SORTS OF QUESTIONS I 'M A NEUROSCIENTIST SO HOW WOULD WE COME UP WITH A QUESTION IN NEUROSCIENCE BECAUSE IT 'S NOT ALWAYS QUITE SO STRAIGHTFORWARD SO FOR EXAMPLE WE COULD SAY WELL WHAT IS IT THAT THE BRAIN DOES WELL ONE THING THE BRAIN DOES IT MOVES US AROUND WE WALK AROUND ON TWO LEGS
StuartFirestein_2013 THAT SEEMS KIND OF SIMPLE SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER I MEAN VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY OVER TEN MONTHS OF AGE WALKS AROUND ON TWO LEGS RIGHT SO THAT MAYBE IS NOT THAT INTERESTING SO INSTEAD MAYBE WE WANT TO CHOOSE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED TO LOOK AT HOW ABOUT THE VISUAL SYSTEM
StuartFirestein_2013 THERE IT IS THE VISUAL SYSTEM I MEAN WE LOVE OUR VISUAL SYSTEMS WE DO ALL KINDS OF COOL STUFF INDEED THERE ARE OVER TWELVE THOUSAND NEUROSCIENTISTS WHO WORK ON THE VISUAL SYSTEM FROM THE RETINA TO THE VISUAL CORTEX IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND NOT JUST THE VISUAL SYSTEM BUT TO ALSO UNDERSTAND HOW GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF HOW THE BRAIN MIGHT WORK
StuartFirestein_2013 BUT NOW HERE 'S THE THING OUR TECHNOLOGY HAS ACTUALLY BEEN PRETTY GOOD AT REPLICATING WHAT THE VISUAL SYSTEM DOES WE HAVE TV WE HAVE MOVIES WE HAVE ANIMATION WE HAVE PHOTOGRAPHY
StuartFirestein_2013 WE HAVE PATTERN RECOGNITION ALL OF THESE SORTS OF THINGS THEY WORK DIFFERENTLY THAN OUR VISUAL SYSTEMS IN SOME CASES BUT NONETHELESS WE 'VE BEEN PRETTY GOOD AT MAKING A TECHNOLOGY WORK LIKE OUR VISUAL SYSTEM
StuartFirestein_2013 SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER A HUNDRED YEARS OF ROBOTICS YOU NEVER SAW A ROBOT WALK ON TWO LEGS BECAUSE ROBOTS DON 'T WALK ON TWO LEGS BECAUSE IT 'S NOT SUCH AN EASY THING TO DO
StuartFirestein_2013 PLAIN OLD MOLECULES BUT IF YOU SNIFF THOSE MOLECULES UP THESE
StuartFirestein_2013 EVEN IF THERE 'S NO ROSE THERE YOU 'LL HAVE THE MEMORY OF A MOLECULE HOW DO WE TURN MOLECULES INTO PERCEPTIONS WHAT 'S THE PROCESS BY WHICH THAT COULD HAPPEN HERE 'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE TWO VERY SIMPLE MOLECULES AGAIN IN THIS KIND OF CHEMICAL NOTATION
StuartFirestein_2013 IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO VISUALIZE THEM THIS WAY SO THE GRAY CIRCLES ARE CARBON ATOMS THE WHITE ONES ARE HYDROGEN ATOMS AND THE RED ONES ARE OXYGEN ATOMS NOW THESE TWO MOLECULES DIFFER BY ONLY ONE CARBON ATOM AND TWO LITTLE HYDROGEN ATOMS THAT RIDE ALONG WITH IT
StuartFirestein_2013 AND YET ONE OF THEM HEPTYL ACETATE HAS THE DISTINCT ODOR OF A PEAR AND HEXYL ACETATE IS UNMISTAKABLY BANANA
StuartFirestein_2013 SO THERE ARE TWO REALLY INTERESTING QUESTIONS HERE IT SEEMS TO ME ONE IS HOW CAN A SIMPLE LITTLE MOLECULE LIKE THAT CREATE A PERCEPTION IN YOUR BRAIN THAT 'S SO CLEAR AS A PEAR OR A BANANA AND SECONDLY
StuartFirestein_2013 HOW THE HELL CAN WE TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO MOLECULES THAT DIFFER BY A SINGLE CARBON ATOM
StuartFirestein_2013 I MEAN THAT 'S REMARKABLE TO ME CLEARLY THE BEST CHEMICAL DETECTOR ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET AND YOU DON 'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT DO YOU
StuartFirestein_2013 SO THIS IS A FAVORITE QUOTE OF MINE THAT TAKES US BACK TO THE IGNORANCE AND THE IDEA OF QUESTIONS I LIKE TO QUOTE BECAUSE I THINK DEAD PEOPLE SHOULDN 'T BE EXCLUDED FROM THE CONVERSATION
StuartFirestein_2013 AND I ALSO THINK IT 'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT THE CONVERSATION 'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE BY THE WAY SO ERWIN SCHRODINGER A GREAT QUANTUM PHYSICIST AND I THINK PHILOSOPHER POINTS OUT HOW YOU HAVE TO ABIDE BY IGNORANCE FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME AND IT 'S THIS ABIDING BY IGNORANCE THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO DO THIS IS A TRICKY THING THIS IS NOT SUCH AN EASY BUSINESS
StuartFirestein_2013 I GUESS IT COMES DOWN TO OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM SO I 'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IGNORANCE AND EDUCATION BECAUSE I THINK THAT 'S WHERE IT REALLY HAS TO PLAY OUT SO FOR ONE LET 'S FACE IT
StuartFirestein_2013 IN THE AGE OF GOOGLE AND WIKIPEDIA THE BUSINESS MODEL OF THE UNIVERSITY AND PROBABLY SECONDARY SCHOOLS IS SIMPLY GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE WE JUST CAN 'T SELL FACTS FOR A LIVING ANYMORE THEY 'RE AVAILABLE WITH A CLICK OF THE MOUSE OR IF YOU WANT TO YOU COULD PROBABLY JUST ASK THE WALL ONE OF THESE DAYS WHEREVER THEY 'RE GOING TO HIDE THE THINGS THAT TELL US ALL THIS STUFF
StuartFirestein_2013 SO WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO WE HAVE TO GIVE OUR STUDENTS A TASTE FOR THE BOUNDARIES FOR WHAT 'S OUTSIDE THAT CIRCUMFERENCE FOR WHAT 'S OUTSIDE THE FACTS WHAT 'S JUST BEYOND THE FACTS
StuartFirestein_2013 HOW DO WE DO THAT
StuartFirestein_2013 WELL ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF COURSE TURNS OUT TO BE TESTING WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM
StuartFirestein_2013 WHICH IS VERY EFFICIENT BUT IS VERY EFFICIENT AT A RATHER BAD THING SO IN SECOND GRADE ALL THE KIDS ARE INTERESTED IN SCIENCE THE GIRLS AND THE BOYS THEY LIKE TO TAKE STUFF APART THEY HAVE GREAT CURIOSITY THEY LIKE TO INVESTIGATE THINGS THEY GO TO SCIENCE MUSEUMS THEY LIKE TO PLAY AROUND
StuartFirestein_2013 THEY 'RE INTERESTED
StuartFirestein_2013 BUT BY ELEVENTH OR TWELFTH GRADE FEWER THAN TEN PERCENT OF THEM
StuartFirestein_2013 HAVE ANY INTEREST IN SCIENCE WHATSOEVER LET ALONE A DESIRE TO GO INTO SCIENCE AS A CAREER SO WE HAVE THIS REMARKABLY EFFICIENT SYSTEM FOR BEATING ANY INTEREST IN SCIENCE OUT OF EVERYBODY 'S HEAD
StuartFirestein_2013 IS THIS WHAT WE WANT I THINK THIS COMES FROM WHAT A TEACHER COLLEAGUE OF MINE CALLS THE BULIMIC METHOD OF EDUCATION YOU KNOW YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT IT IS WE JUST JAM A WHOLE BUNCH OF FACTS DOWN THEIR THROATS OVER HERE AND THEN THEY PUKE IT UP ON AN EXAM OVER HERE AND EVERYBODY GOES HOME WITH NO ADDED INTELLECTUAL HEFT WHATSOEVER
StuartFirestein_2013 THIS CAN 'T POSSIBLY CONTINUE TO GO ON SO WHAT DO WE DO WELL THE GENETICISTS I HAVE TO SAY HAVE AN INTERESTING MAXIM THEY LIVE BY GENETICISTS ALWAYS SAY YOU ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU SCREEN FOR
StuartFirestein_2013 AND THAT 'S MEANT AS A WARNING
StuartFirestein_2013 SO WE ALWAYS WILL GET WHAT WE SCREEN FOR AND PART OF WHAT WE SCREEN FOR IS IN OUR TESTING METHODS WELL WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT TESTING AND EVALUATION AND WE HAVE TO THINK CAREFULLY WHEN WE 'RE TESTING WHETHER WE 'RE EVALUATING OR WHETHER WE 'RE WEEDING WHETHER WE 'RE WEEDING PEOPLE OUT WHETHER WE 'RE MAKING SOME CUT
StuartFirestein_2013 EVALUATION IS ONE THING YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT EVALUATION IN THE LITERATURE THESE DAYS IN THE EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE BUT EVALUATION REALLY AMOUNTS TO FEEDBACK AND IT AMOUNTS TO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TRIAL AND ERROR IT AMOUNTS TO A CHANCE TO WORK OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME WITH THIS KIND OF FEEDBACK
StuartFirestein_2013 THAT 'S DIFFERENT THAN WEEDING AND USUALLY I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT EVALUATION EVALUATING STUDENTS EVALUATING TEACHERS EVALUATING SCHOOLS EVALUATING PROGRAMS THAT THEY 'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT WEEDING AND THAT 'S A BAD THING BECAUSE THEN YOU WILL GET WHAT YOU SELECT FOR
StuartFirestein_2013 WHICH IS WHAT WE 'VE GOTTEN SO FAR SO I 'D SAY WHAT WE NEED IS A TEST THAT SAYS WHAT IS X AND THE ANSWERS ARE I DON 'T KNOW BECAUSE NO ONE DOES OR WHAT 'S THE QUESTION EVEN BETTER OR YOU KNOW WHAT I 'LL LOOK IT UP I 'LL ASK SOMEONE I 'LL PHONE SOMEONE I 'LL FIND OUT
StuartFirestein_2013 BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO DO AND THAT 'S HOW YOU EVALUATE THEM AND MAYBE FOR THE ADVANCED PLACEMENT CLASSES IT COULD BE HERE 'S THE ANSWER WHAT 'S THE NEXT QUESTION THAT 'S THE ONE I LIKE IN PARTICULAR SO LET ME END WITH A QUOTE FROM WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS WHO SAID EDUCATION IS NOT ABOUT FILLING BUCKETS IT IS LIGHTING FIRES SO I 'D SAY
