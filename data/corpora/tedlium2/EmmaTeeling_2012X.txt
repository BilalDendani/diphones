EmmaTeeling_2012X ALL TO DO RIGHT NOW
EmmaTeeling_2012X IS TO THINK OF THIS MAMMAL THAT I 'M GOING TO DESCRIBE TO YOU THE FIRST THING I 'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT THIS MAMMAL IS THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR OUR ECOSYSTEMS TO FUNCTION CORRECTLY IF WE REMOVE THIS MAMMAL FROM OUR ECOSYSTEMS THEY SIMPLY WILL NOT WORK
EmmaTeeling_2012X AND THE THIRD REALLY INTRIGUING ASPECT OF THIS MAMMAL IS THAT I FULLY BELIEVE THAT THE SECRET OF EVERLASTING YOUTH LIES DEEP WITHIN ITS DNA
EmmaTeeling_2012X SO ARE YOU ALL THINKING SO
EmmaTeeling_2012X MAGNIFICENT CREATURE ISN 'T IT WHO HERE
EmmaTeeling_2012X ONE FIFTH OF ALL LIVING MAMMALS IS A BAT AND THEY HAVE VERY UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES BATS AS WE KNOW THEM HAVE BEEN AROUND ON THIS PLANET FOR ABOUT SIXTY FOUR MILLION YEARS
EmmaTeeling_2012X INDEED THEY DO LOOK VERY STRANGE WE 'RE HUMANS WE 'RE A VISUAL SPECIES
EmmaTeeling_2012X WHEN SCIENTISTS FIRST REALIZED THAT BATS WERE ACTUALLY USING SOUND TO BE ABLE TO FLY AND ORIENT AND MOVE AT NIGHT WE DIDN 'T BELIEVE IT FOR A HUNDRED YEARS DESPITE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THIS IS WHAT THEY WERE DOING WE DIDN 'T BELIEVE IT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT
EmmaTeeling_2012X AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS ON THE FACE OF THIS BEAUTIFUL HORSESHOE BAT YOU SEE A LOT OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS ARE DEDICATED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SOUND AND PERCEIVE IT
EmmaTeeling_2012X VERY BIG EARS STRANGE NOSE LEAVES BUT TEENY TINY EYES SO AGAIN IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THIS BAT YOU REALIZE SOUND IS VERY
EmmaTeeling_2012X THE PREVIOUS ONE HOWEVER THERE ARE A GROUP THAT DO NOT USE ECHOLOCATION THEY DO NOT PERCEIVE THEIR ENVIRONMENT USING SOUND AND THESE ARE THE FLYING FOXES IF ANYBODY HAS EVER BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE IN AUSTRALIA YOU 'VE SEEN THEM COMING OUT OF THE BOTANIC GARDENS IN SYDNEY AND IF YOU JUST LOOK
EmmaTeeling_2012X NOW THIS IS WESTERN SOCIETY AND WHAT I HOPE TO DO TONIGHT IS TO CONVINCE YOU OF THE CHINESE TRADITIONAL CULTURE THAT THEY PERCEIVE BATS AS
EmmaTeeling_2012X CREATURES THAT BRING GOOD LUCK AND INDEED IF YOU WALK INTO A CHINESE HOME YOU MAY SEE AN IMAGE SUCH AS THIS THIS IS CONSIDERED THE FIVE BLESSINGS THE CHINESE WORD FOR BAT SOUNDS LIKE THE CHINESE WORD FOR HAPPINESS
EmmaTeeling_2012X AND WHY IS THIS
EmmaTeeling_2012X FOR OUR ECOSYSTEMS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THEM IT 'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM
EmmaTeeling_2012X BUT MOST BATS ARE VORACIOUS INSECT PREDATORS IT 'S BEEN ESTIMATED IN THE U S IN A TINY COLONY OF BIG BROWN BATS THAT THEY WILL FEED ON OVER A MILLION INSECTS A YEAR AND IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
EmmaTeeling_2012X RIGHT NOW BATS ARE BEING THREATENED BY A DISEASE KNOWN AS WHITE NOSE SYNDROME IT 'S WORKING ITS WAY SLOWLY ACROSS THE U S AND WIPING OUT POPULATIONS OF BATS AND SCIENTISTS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED METRIC TONS OF INSECTS A YEAR
EmmaTeeling_2012X AND FOR ONE YEAR IN THE U S ALONE IT 'S ESTIMATED THAT IT 'S GOING TO COST TWENTY TWO BILLION U S DOLLARS IF WE REMOVE BATS SO INDEED BATS THEN DO BRING US WEALTH THEY MAINTAIN THE HEALTH OF OUR ECOSYSTEMS AND ALSO THEY SAVE US MONEY
EmmaTeeling_2012X SO AGAIN THAT 'S THE FIRST BLESSING BATS ARE IMPORTANT FOR OUR ECOSYSTEMS AND WHAT ABOUT THE SECOND WHAT ABOUT
EmmaTeeling_2012X INSIDE EVERY CELL IN YOUR BODY LIES YOUR GENOME YOUR GENOME IS MADE UP OF YOUR DNA YOUR DNA CODES FOR PROTEINS THAT ENABLE YOU TO FUNCTION AND INTERACT AND BE AS YOU ARE NOW SINCE
EmmaTeeling_2012X THE NEW ADVANCEMENTS IN MODERN MOLECULAR TECHNOLOGIES IT IS NOW POSSIBLE FOR US TO SEQUENCE OUR OWN GENOME
EmmaTeeling_2012X IN A VERY RAPID TIME AND AT A VERY VERY REDUCED COST
EmmaTeeling_2012X SO THROUGH NATURAL SELECTION
EmmaTeeling_2012X OVER TIME MUTATIONS VARIATIONS THAT DISRUPT THE FUNCTION OF A PROTEIN WILL NOT BE TOLERATED OVER TIME EVOLUTION ACTS AS A SIEVE IT SIEVES OUT THE BAD VARIATION AND SO THEREFORE IF YOU LOOK AT THE SAME REGION OF A GENOME
EmmaTeeling_2012X IN MANY MAMMALS THAT HAVE BEEN
EmmaTeeling_2012X SO IN MY LAB WE 'VE BEEN USING BATS TO LOOK AT TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISEASES OF THE SENSES WE 'RE LOOKING AT BLINDNESS NOW WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS
EmmaTeeling_2012X ALSO WE LOOK AT DEAFNESS ONE IN EVERY ONE THOUSAND NEWBORN BABIES ARE DEAF
EmmaTeeling_2012X AND WHEN WE REACH EIGHTY OVER HALF OF US WILL ALSO HAVE A HEARING PROBLEM
EmmaTeeling_2012X SO THIS IS WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE
EmmaTeeling_2012X AGING IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST FAMILIAR YET THE LEAST WELL UNDERSTOOD ASPECTS OF ALL OF BIOLOGY AND REALLY SINCE THE DAWN OF CIVILIZATION MANKIND HAS SOUGHT TO AVOID IT
EmmaTeeling_2012X BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT A BIT BETTER
EmmaTeeling_2012X IN EUROPE ALONE BY TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTY THERE IS GOING TO BE A SEVENTY PERCENT INCREASE OF INDIVIDUALS OVER SIXTY FIVE AND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PERCENT INCREASE IN INDIVIDUALS OVER EIGHTY AS WE AGE WE DETERIORATE AND THIS DETERIORATION CAUSES PROBLEMS FOR OUR SOCIETY SO WE HAVE TO ADDRESS IT SO
EmmaTeeling_2012X HOW LONG THIS BAT COULD LIVE FOR WHO PUT UP YOUR HANDS WHO SAYS TWO YEARS
EmmaTeeling_2012X WELL TYPICALLY IN MAMMALS
EmmaTeeling_2012X THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BODY SIZE METABOLIC RATE AND HOW LONG YOU CAN LIVE FOR AND YOU CAN PREDICT HOW LONG A MAMMAL CAN LIVE FOR GIVEN ITS BODY SIZE
EmmaTeeling_2012X THERE ARE NINETEEN SPECIES OF MAMMAL THAT LIVE LONGER THAN EXPECTED GIVEN THEIR BODY SIZE THAN MAN AND EIGHTEEN OF THOSE
EmmaTeeling_2012X THEY MUST HAVE SOMETHING WITHIN THEIR DNA THAT ABLES THEM TO DEAL WITH THE METABOLIC STRESSES PARTICULARLY OF FLIGHT THEY EXPEND THREE TIMES MORE ENERGY THAN A MAMMAL OF THE SAME SIZE BUT DON 'T SEEM TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OR THE EFFECTS SO RIGHT NOW
EmmaTeeling_2012X AND I BELIEVE THAT BY STUDYING BATS WE CAN UNCOVER THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS THAT ENABLE MAMMALS TO ACHIEVE EXTRAORDINARY LONGEVITY IF WE FIND OUT WHAT THEY 'RE DOING PERHAPS THROUGH GENE THERAPY WE CAN ENABLE US TO DO THE SAME THING
EmmaTeeling_2012X POTENTIALLY THIS MEANS THAT WE COULD HALT AGING OR MAYBE EVEN REVERSE IT JUST IMAGINE WHAT THAT WOULD BE LIKE
EmmaTeeling_2012X SO REALLY I DON 'T THINK WE SHOULD BE THINKING OF THEM AS FLYING DEMONS OF THE NIGHT BUT MORE AS OUR SUPERHEROES
EmmaTeeling_2012X AND THE REALITY IS THAT BATS CAN BRING US SO MUCH BENEFIT IF WE JUST LOOK IN THE RIGHT PLACE THEY 'RE GOOD FOR OUR ECOSYSTEM THEY ALLOW US TO UNDERSTAND HOW OUR GENOME FUNCTIONS AND THEY POTENTIALLY HOLD THE SECRET TO EVERLASTING
EmmaTeeling_2012X SO TONIGHT WHEN YOU WALK OUT OF HERE AND YOU LOOK UP IN THE NIGHT SKIES AND YOU SEE THIS BEAUTIFUL FLYING MAMMAL I WANT YOU TO SMILE THANK YOU
