KateOrff_2010W@16.39:16.81 I AM
KateOrff_2010W@17.43:28.79 PASSIONATE ABOUT THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE AND HOW THE PHYSICAL FORM OF THE LAND FROM THE GREAT CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA TO THE BEDROCK OF MANHATTAN HAS REALLY SHAPED OUR HISTORY AND OUR CHARACTER
KateOrff_2010W@29.23:42.29 BUT ONE THING IS CLEAR IN THE LAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS ALONE OUR COUNTRY AND THIS IS A SPRAWL MAP OF AMERICA OUR COUNTRY HAS SYSTEMATICALLY FLATTENED AND HOMOGENIZED THE LANDSCAPE TO THE POINT WHERE WE'VE FORGOTTEN
KateOrff_2010W@42.83:55.21 OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT LIVE ALONGSIDE US AND THE DIRT BENEATH OUR FEET AND SO HOW I SEE MY WORK CONTRIBUTING IS SORT OF TRYING TO LITERALLY RE IMAGINE THESE CONNECTIONS AND PHYSICALLY REBUILD THEM
KateOrff_2010W@55.94:66.93 THIS GRAPH REPRESENTS WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH NOW IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND IT'S REALLY A CONFLUX OF URBAN POPULATION RISING BIODIVERSITY PLUMMETING
KateOrff_2010W@67.23:75.74 AND ALSO OF COURSE SEA LEVELS RISING AND CLIMATE CHANGING SO WHEN I ALSO THINK ABOUT DESIGN I THINK ABOUT TRYING TO
KateOrff_2010W@77.29:86.00 AND REENGAGE THE LINES ON THIS GRAPH IN A MORE PRODUCTIVE WAY AND YOU CAN SEE FROM THE ARROW HERE INDICATING YOU ARE HERE
KateOrff_2010W@86.57:95.14 I'M TRYING TO SORT OF BLEND AND MELD THESE TWO VERY DIVERGENT FIELDS OF URBANISM AND ECOLOGY AND SORT OF BRING THEM TOGETHER IN AN EXCITING NEW WAY
KateOrff_2010W@96.51:109.45 SO THE ERA OF BIG INFRASTRUCTURE IS OVER I MEAN THESE SORT OF TOP DOWN MONO FUNCTIONAL CAPITAL INTENSIVE SOLUTIONS ARE REALLY NOT GOING TO CUT IT WE NEED NEW TOOLS AND NEW APPROACHES
KateOrff_2010W@110.05:117.71 SIMILARLY THE IDEA OF ARCHITECTURE AS THIS SORT OF OBJECT IN THE FIELD DEVOID OF CONTEXT IS REALLY NOT THE
KateOrff_2010W@119.04:127.94 IT'S FAIRLY BLATANT IS REALLY NOT THE APPROACH THAT WE NEED TO TAKE SO WE NEED NEW STORIES NEW HEROES
KateOrff_2010W@128.51:136.60 AND NEW TOOLS SO NOW I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MY NEW HERO IN THE GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE WAR AND THAT IS THE EASTERN OYSTER
KateOrff_2010W@137.20:150.65 SO ALBEIT A VERY SMALL CREATURE AND VERY MODEST THIS CREATURE IS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE IT CAN AGGLOMERATE INTO THESE MEGA REEF STRUCTURES IT CAN GROW YOU CAN GROW IT AND DID I MENTION IT'S QUITE TASTY
KateOrff_2010W@152.35:159.91 SO THE OYSTER WAS THE BASIS FOR A MANIFESTO LIKE URBAN DESIGN PROJECT THAT I DID ABOUT THE NEW YORK HARBOR CALLED OYSTER TECTURE
KateOrff_2010W@160.29:174.29 AND THE CORE IDEA OF OYSTER TECTURE IS TO HARNESS THE BIOLOGICAL POWER OF MUSSELS EEL GRASS AND OYSTERS SPECIES THAT LIVE IN THE HARBOR AND AT THE SAME TIME HARNESS THE POWER OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY
KateOrff_2010W@177.89:185.93 HERE 'S A MAP OF MY CITY NEW YORK CITY WITH SHOWING INUNDATION IN RED AND WHAT'S CIRCLED IS THE SITE THAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE GOWANUS CANAL
KateOrff_2010W@186.48:192.85 AND GOVERNORS ISLAND IF YOU LOOK HERE AT THIS MAP SHOWING EVERYTHING IN BLUE IS OUT IN THE WATER
KateOrff_2010W@193.49:206.66 AND EVERYTHING IN YELLOW IS UPLAND BUT YOU CAN SEE EVEN JUST INTUIT FROM THIS MAP THAT THE HARBOR HAS DREDGED AND FLATTENED AND WENT FROM A RICH THREE DIMENSIONAL MOSAIC TO FLAT MUCK IN REALLY A MATTER OF YEARS
KateOrff_2010W@207.66:216.24 ANOTHER SET OF VIEWS OF ACTUALLY THE GOWANUS CANAL ITSELF NOW THE GOWANUS IS PARTICULARLY SMELLY I WILL ADMIT IT THERE ARE PROBLEMS OF SEWAGE OVERFLOW
KateOrff_2010W@216.51:222.73 AND CONTAMINATION BUT I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT ALMOST EVERY CITY HAS THIS EXACT CONDITION
KateOrff_2010W@223.26:234.78 AND IT'S A CONDITION THAT WE'RE ALL FACING AND HERE 'S A MAP OF THAT CONDITION SHOWING THE CONTAMINANTS IN YELLOW AND GREEN EXACERBATED BY THIS NEW FLOW STORM SURGE AND SEA LEVEL RISE SO WE REALLY HAD A LOT TO DEAL WITH
KateOrff_2010W@235.89:244.65 WHEN WE STARTED THIS PROJECT ONE OF THE CORE IDEAS WAS TO LOOK BACK IN HISTORY AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THERE AND YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS MAP
KateOrff_2010W@244.98:253.84 THERE'S THIS INCREDIBLE GEOGRAPHICAL SIGNATURE OF A SERIES OF ISLANDS THAT WERE OUT IN THE HARBOR AND A MATRIX OF SALT MARSHES AND BEACHES
KateOrff_2010W@279.10:287.61 THAT WOULD THEN PROTECT NEW SETTLEMENT PATTERNS INLAND AND THE GOWANUS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE CLEANER WATER AND SLOWER WATER YOU CAN IMAGINE A NEW WAY OF LIVING WITH THAT WATER
KateOrff_2010W@288.19:292.53 SO THE PROJECT REALLY ADDRESSES THESE THREE CORE ISSUES IN A NEW AND EXCITING WAY I THINK
KateOrff_2010W@294.58:302.90 HERE WE ARE BACK TO OUR HERO THE OYSTER AND AGAIN IT'S THIS INCREDIBLY EXCITING ANIMAL IT ACCEPTS ALGAE AND DETRITUS IN ONE END AND THROUGH THIS
KateOrff_2010W@332.50:339.31 OYSTER CART WHICH IS NOW AS UBIQUITOUS AS THE HOTDOG CART IS TODAY SO AGAIN WE GOT THE SHORT END OF THE DEAL THERE
KateOrff_2010W@341.61:347.90 OYSTERS CAN ATTENUATE AND AGGLOMERATE ONTO EACH OTHER AND FORM THESE AMAZING NATURAL REEF STRUCTURES
KateOrff_2010W@348.17:357.16 THEY REALLY BECOME NATURE 'S WAVE ATTENUATORS AND THEY BECOME THE BEDROCK OF ANY HARBOR ECOSYSTEM MANY MANY SPECIES DEPEND ON THEM
KateOrff_2010W@357.95:364.26 SO WE WERE INSPIRED BY THE OYSTER BUT I WAS ALSO INSPIRED BY THEY LIFE CYCLE OF THE OYSTER IT CAN MOVE FROM A FERTILIZED
KateOrff_2010W@364.92:375.27 TO A SPAT WHICH IS WHEN THEY'RE FLOATING THROUGH THE WATER AND WHEN THEY'RE READY TO ATTACH ONTO ANOTHER OYSTER TO AN ADULT MALE OYSTER OR FEMALE OYSTER IN A NUMBER OF WEEKS
KateOrff_2010W@376.20:383.15 WE REINTERPRETED THIS LIFE CYCLE ON THE SCALE OF OUR SIGHT AND TOOK THE GOWANUS AS A GIANT OYSTER NURSERY
KateOrff_2010W@391.51:399.95 THE CORE IDEA HERE WAS TO HIT THE RESET BUTTON AND REGENERATE AN ECOLOGY OVER TIME THAT WAS REGENERATIVE AND CLEANING AND PRODUCTIVE
KateOrff_2010W@400.77:408.66 HOW DOES THE REEF WORK WELL IT'S VERY VERY SIMPLE A CORE CONCEPT HERE IS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE ISN'T SOMETHING THAT
KateOrff_2010W@409.40:418.68 THE ANSWERS WON 'T LAND DOWN FROM THE MOON AND WITH A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR PRICE TAG WE SHOULD SIMPLY START AND GET TO WORK WITH WHAT WE HAVE NOW AND WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US
KateOrff_2010W@419.02:425.46 SO THIS IMAGE IS SIMPLY SHOWING IT'S A FIELD OF MARINE PILES INTERCONNECTED WITH THIS WOVEN FUZZY ROPE
KateOrff_2010W@426.34:427.75 WHAT IS FUZZY ROPE YOU ASK
KateOrff_2010W@428.74:441.18 IT'S JUST THAT IT'S THIS VERY INEXPENSIVE THING AVAILABLE PRACTICALLY AT YOUR HARDWARE STORE AND IT'S VERY CHEAP SO WE IMAGINE THAT WE WOULD ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY EVEN HOST A BAKE SALE TO START OUR NEW PROJECT
KateOrff_2010W@442.98:449.48 SO IN THE STUDIO RATHER THAN DRAWING WE BEGAN TO LEARN HOW TO KNIT THE CONCEPT WAS TO REALLY KNIT THIS ROPE TOGETHER
KateOrff_2010W@449.73:456.64 AND DEVELOP THIS NEW SOFT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE OYSTERS TO GROW ON YOU CAN SEE IN THE DIAGRAM HOW IT GROWS OVER TIME
KateOrff_2010W@477.68:487.61 IN THE END WHAT WE REALIZED WE WERE MAKING WAS A NEW BLUE GREEN WATERY PARK FOR THE NEXT WATERY CENTURY AN AMPHIBIOUS PARK IF YOU WILL SO GET YOUR TEVAS ON
KateOrff_2010W@488.52:499.31 SO YOU CAN IMAGINE SCUBA DIVING HERE THIS IS AN IMAGE OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SCUBA DIVERS THAT WE WORKED WITH ON OUR TEAM SO YOU CAN IMAGINE A SORT OF NEW MANNER OF LIVING WITH A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WATER
KateOrff_2010W@499.65:509.27 AND ALSO A HYBRIDIZING OF RECREATIONAL AND SCIENCE PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF MONITORING ANOTHER NEW VOCABULARY WORD FOR THE BRAVE NEW WORLD THIS IS THE WORD FLUPSY
KateOrff_2010W@509.52:519.35 IT'S SHORT FOR FLOATING UPWELLING SYSTEM AND THIS GLORIOUS READILY AVAILABLE DEVICE IS BASICALLY A FLOATING RAFT WITH AN OYSTER NURSERY BELOW
KateOrff_2010W@519.81:529.08 SO THE WATER IS CHURNED THROUGH THIS RAFT YOU CAN SEE THE EIGHT CHAMBERS ON THE SIDE HOST LITTLE BABY OYSTERS AND ESSENTIALLY FORCE FEED THEM SO RATHER THAN HAVING
KateOrff_2010W@529.57:538.54 TEN OYSTERS YOU HAVE TEN THOUSAND OYSTERS AND THEN THOSE SPAT ARE THEN SEEDED HERE 'S THE GOWANUS FUTURE WITH THE
KateOrff_2010W@542.34:547.82 NEW WORD AND ALSO SHOWING OYSTER GARDENING FOR THE COMMUNITY ALONG ITS EDGES
KateOrff_2010W@548.78:556.99 AND FINALLY HOW MUCH FUN IT WOULD BE TO WATCH THE FLUPSY PARADE AND CHEER ON THE OYSTER SPATS AS THEY GO DOWN TO THE REEF
KateOrff_2010W@557.42:567.70 I GET ASKED TWO QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PROJECT ONE IS WHY ISN'T IT HAPPENING NOW AND THE SECOND ONE IS WHEN CAN WE EAT THE OYSTERS AND THE ANSWER IS NOT YET THEY'RE WORKING
KateOrff_2010W@579.05:585.58 BUT MY DREAM IS MY HOPE IS THAT WHEN YOU ALL GO BACK TO YOUR OWN CITIES THAT WE CAN START TO WORK TOGETHER AND COLLABORATE
KateOrff_2010W@586.03:595.62 ON REMAKING AND REFORMING A NEW URBAN LANDSCAPE TOWARDS A MORE SUSTAINABLE A MORE LIVABLE AND A MORE DELICIOUS FUTURE THANK YOU
