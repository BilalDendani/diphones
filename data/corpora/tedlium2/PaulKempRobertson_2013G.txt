PaulKempRobertson_2013G BUT IF I WAS TO SAY THAT THEY 'RE BOTH EXAMPLES OF ALTERNATIVE OR NEW FORMS OF CURRENCY IN A HYPERCONNECTED DATA DRIVEN GLOBAL ECONOMY YOU 'D PROBABLY THINK I WAS A LITTLE BIT BONKERS BUT TRUST ME I WORK IN ADVERTISING
PaulKempRobertson_2013G AND I 'M PROBABLY NOT GOING TO DO IT PROPER SERVICE HERE BUT MY INTERPRETATION OF HOW IT WORKS IS THAT BITCOINS ARE RELEASED THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF MINING
PaulKempRobertson_2013G SO THERE 'S A NETWORK OF COMPUTERS THAT ARE CHALLENGED TO SOLVE A VERY COMPLEX MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM AND THE PERSON THAT MANAGES TO SOLVE IT FIRST GETS THE BITCOINS AND THE BITCOINS ARE RELEASED THEY 'RE PUT INTO A PUBLIC LEDGER CALLED THE BLOCKCHAIN AND THEN THEY FLOAT SO THEY BECOME A CURRENCY
PaulKempRobertson_2013G AND COMPLETELY DECENTRALIZED THAT 'S THE SORT OF SCARY THING ABOUT THIS WHICH IS WHY IT 'S SO POPULAR SO IT 'S NOT RUN BY THE AUTHORITIES OR THE STATE IT 'S ACTUALLY MANAGED BY THE NETWORK
PaulKempRobertson_2013G BUT WHAT IT DOES SHOW IS THAT IT 'S SORT OF GAINING GROUND IT 'S GAINING RESPECTABILITY YOU GET SERVICES LIKE REDDIT AND WORDPRESS ARE ACTUALLY ACCEPTING BITCOIN
PaulKempRobertson_2013G AS A PAYMENT CURRENCY NOW AND THAT 'S SHOWING YOU THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY PLACING TRUST IN TECHNOLOGY AND IT 'S STARTED TO TRUMP AND DISRUPT AND INTERROGATE TRADITIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND HOW WE THINK ABOUT CURRENCIES
PaulKempRobertson_2013G AND MONEY AND THAT 'S NOT SURPRISING IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE BASKET CASE THAT IS THE E U I THINK THERE WAS A GALLUP SURVEY OUT RECENTLY THAT SAID SOMETHING LIKE IN AMERICA TRUST IN BANKS IS AT AN ALL TIME LOW IT 'S SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY ONE PERCENT
PaulKempRobertson_2013G AND YOU CAN SEE HERE SOME PHOTOGRAPHS FROM LONDON WHERE BARCLAYS SPONSORED THE CITY BIKE SCHEME AND SOME ACTIVISTS HAVE DONE SOME NICE PIECE OF GUERRILLA MARKETING HERE AND DOCTORED THE SLOGANS
PaulKempRobertson_2013G SUB PRIME PEDALING BARCLAYS TAKES YOU FOR A RIDE THESE ARE THE MORE POLITE ONES I COULD SHARE WITH YOU TODAY BUT YOU GET THE GIST SO PEOPLE HAVE REALLY STARTED TO SORT OF LOSE FAITH
PaulKempRobertson_2013G PRECISELY AROUND TRUST AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING AND THIS IS A GLOBAL SURVEY SO THESE NUMBERS ARE GLOBAL
PaulKempRobertson_2013G AND WHAT 'S INTERESTING IS THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT HIERARCHY IS HAVING A BIT OF A WOBBLE AND IT 'S ALL ABOUT HETERARCHICAL NOW SO PEOPLE TRUST PEOPLE LIKE THEMSELVES MORE THAN THEY TRUST CORPORATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THESE FIGURES FOR THE MORE DEVELOPED MARKETS LIKE U K GERMANY AND SO ON THEY 'RE ACTUALLY MUCH LOWER
PaulKempRobertson_2013G AND I FIND THAT SORT OF SCARY PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY TRUSTING BUSINESSPEOPLE MORE THAN THEY 'RE TRUSTING GOVERNMENTS AND LEADERS
PaulKempRobertson_2013G SO WHAT 'S STARTING TO HAPPEN IF YOU THINK ABOUT MONEY IF YOU SORT OF BOIL MONEY DOWN TO AN ESSENCE IT IS LITERALLY JUST AN EXPRESSION OF VALUE AN AGREED VALUE
PaulKempRobertson_2013G SO WHAT 'S HAPPENING NOW IN THE DIGITAL AGE IS THAT WE CAN QUANTIFY VALUE IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND DO IT MORE EASILY AND SOMETIMES THE WAY THAT WE QUANTIFY THOSE VALUES IT MAKES IT MUCH EASIER TO CREATE NEW FORMS AND VALID FORMS OF CURRENCY
PaulKempRobertson_2013G IN THAT CONTEXT YOU CAN SEE THAT NETWORKS LIKE BITCOIN SUDDENLY START TO MAKE A BIT MORE SENSE
PaulKempRobertson_2013G SO IF YOU THINK WE 'RE STARTING TO QUESTION AND DISRUPT AND INTERROGATE WHAT MONEY MEANS WHAT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH IT IS WHAT DEFINES MONEY THEN THE ULTIMATE EXTENSION OF THAT IS
PaulKempRobertson_2013G IS THERE A REASON FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BE IN CHARGE OF MONEY ANYMORE SO OBVIOUSLY I 'M LOOKING AT THIS THROUGH A MARKETING PRISM SO FROM A BRAND PERSPECTIVE BRANDS LITERALLY STAND OR FALL ON THEIR REPUTATIONS AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT REPUTATION HAS NOW BECOME A CURRENCY
PaulKempRobertson_2013G YOU KNOW REPUTATIONS ARE BUILT ON TRUST CONSISTENCY TRANSPARENCY SO IF YOU 'VE ACTUALLY DECIDED THAT YOU TRUST A BRAND YOU WANT A RELATIONSHIP YOU WANT TO ENGAGE WITH THE BRAND YOU 'RE ALREADY KIND OF PARTICIPATING IN LOTS OF NEW FORMS
PaulKempRobertson_2013G OF CURRENCY SO YOU THINK ABOUT LOYALTY LOYALTY ESSENTIALLY IS A MICRO ECONOMY YOU THINK ABOUT REWARDS SCHEMES AIR MILES THE ECONOMIST SAID A FEW YEARS AGO THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY MORE UNREDEEMED AIR MILES IN THE WORLD THAN THERE ARE DOLLAR BILLS IN CIRCULATION
PaulKempRobertson_2013G AND WHAT I FIND INTERESTING IS THAT AMAZON HAS RECENTLY LAUNCHED AMAZON COINS SO ADMITTEDLY IT 'S A CURRENCY AT THE MOMENT THAT 'S PURELY FOR THE KINDLE SO YOU CAN BUY APPS AND MAKE PURCHASES WITHIN THOSE APPS BUT YOU THINK ABOUT AMAZON YOU LOOK AT THE TRUST BAROMETER THAT I SHOWED YOU WHERE PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO TRUST
PaulKempRobertson_2013G BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY BUSINESSES THAT THEY BELIEVE IN AND TRUST MORE THAN GOVERNMENTS SO SUDDENLY YOU START THINKING WELL AMAZON POTENTIALLY COULD PUSH THIS IT COULD BECOME A NATURAL EXTENSION THAT AS WELL AS BUYING STUFF TAKE IT OUT OF THE KINDLE YOU COULD BUY BOOKS MUSIC REAL LIFE PRODUCTS
PaulKempRobertson_2013G AND I 'LL GET YOU BACK TO TIDE THE DETERGENT NOW AS I PROMISED THIS IS A FANTASTIC ARTICLE I CAME ACROSS IN NEW YORK MAGAZINE WHERE IT WAS SAYING THAT DRUG USERS ACROSS AMERICA ARE ACTUALLY PURCHASING DRUGS WITH BOTTLES OF TIDE DETERGENT
PaulKempRobertson_2013G SO THEY 'RE GOING INTO CONVENIENCE STORES STEALING TIDE AND A DOLLAR TWENTY BOTTLE OF TIDE IS EQUAL TO TEN DOLLARS OF CRACK COCAINE OR WEED
PaulKempRobertson_2013G AND WHAT THEY 'RE SAYING SO SOME CRIMINOLOGISTS HAVE LOOKED AT THIS AND THEY 'RE SAYING WELL OKAY TIDE AS A PRODUCT SELLS AT A PREMIUM IT 'S FIFTY PERCENT ABOVE THE CATEGORY AVERAGE IT 'S INFUSED WITH A VERY COMPLEX COCKTAIL OF CHEMICALS SO IT SMELLS VERY LUXURIOUS AND VERY DISTINCTIVE
PaulKempRobertson_2013G AND BEING A PROCTER AND GAMBLE BRAND IT 'S BEEN SUPPORTED BY A LOT OF MASS MEDIA ADVERTISING
PaulKempRobertson_2013G SO WHAT THEY 'RE SAYING IS THAT DRUG USERS ARE CONSUMERS TOO SO THEY HAVE THIS IN THEIR NEURAL PATHWAYS WHEN THEY SPOT TIDE THERE 'S A SHORTCUT THEY SAY THAT IS TRUST I TRUST THAT THAT 'S QUALITY
PaulKempRobertson_2013G SO IT BECOMES THIS UNIT OF CURRENCY WHICH THE NEW YORK MAGAZINE DESCRIBED AS A VERY ODDLY LOYAL CRIME WAVE BRAND LOYAL CRIME WAVE AND CRIMINALS ARE ACTUALLY CALLING TIDE LIQUID GOLD
PaulKempRobertson_2013G NOW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS FUNNY WAS THE REACTION FROM THE P G SPOKESPERSON THEY SAID OBVIOUSLY TRIED TO DISSOCIATE THEMSELVES FROM DRUGS BUT SAID
PaulKempRobertson_2013G IT REMINDS ME OF ONE THING AND THAT 'S THE VALUE OF THE BRAND HAS STAYED CONSISTENT
PaulKempRobertson_2013G AND WHAT 'S HAPPENING HERE THIS IS WHERE YOU 'VE ACTUALLY ELECTED TO JOIN THAT NIKE COMMUNITY YOU 'VE BOUGHT INTO IT THEY 'RE NOT ADVERTISING LOUD MESSAGES AT YOU AND THAT 'S WHERE ADVERTISING HAS STARTED TO SHIFT NOW IS INTO THINGS LIKE SERVICES TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS SO NIKE IS LITERALLY ACTING AS A WELL BEING PARTNER A HEALTH AND FITNESS PARTNER AND SERVICE PROVIDER SO WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS IS THEY 'RE SAYING RIGHT
PaulKempRobertson_2013G YOU HAVE A DATA DASHBOARD WE KNOW HOW FAR YOU 'VE RUN HOW FAR YOU 'VE MOVED WHAT YOUR CALORIE INTAKE ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF WHAT YOU CAN DO IS THE MORE YOU RUN THE MORE POINTS YOU GET AND WE HAVE AN AUCTION WHERE YOU CAN BUY NIKE STUFF
PaulKempRobertson_2013G BUT ONLY BY PROVING THAT YOU 'VE ACTUALLY USED THE PRODUCT TO DO STUFF AND YOU CAN 'T COME INTO THIS THIS IS PURELY FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE SWEATING USING NIKE PRODUCTS YOU CAN 'T BUY STUFF WITH PESOS THIS IS LITERALLY A CLOSED ENVIRONMENT A CLOSED AUCTION SPACE
PaulKempRobertson_2013G IN AFRICA YOU KNOW AIRTIME HAS BECOME LITERALLY A CURRENCY IN ITS OWN RIGHT PEOPLE ARE USED TO BECAUSE MOBILE IS KING
PaulKempRobertson_2013G THEY 'RE VERY VERY USED TO TRANSFERRING MONEY MAKING PAYMENTS VIA MOBILE AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE EXAMPLES FROM A BRAND PERSPECTIVE GOING ON IS VODAFONE WHERE IN EGYPT LOTS OF PEOPLE MAKE PURCHASES IN MARKETS AND VERY SMALL INDEPENDENT STORES
PaulKempRobertson_2013G LOOSE CHANGE SMALL CHANGE IS A REAL PROBLEM AND WHAT TENDS TO HAPPEN IS YOU BUY A BUNCH OF STUFF YOU 'RE DUE SAY TEN CENTS TWENTY CENTS IN CHANGE
PaulKempRobertson_2013G THE SHOPKEEPERS TEND TO GIVE YOU THINGS LIKE AN ONION OR AN ASPIRIN OR A PIECE OF GUM BECAUSE THEY DON 'T HAVE SMALL CHANGE SO WHEN VODAFONE CAME IN AND SAW THIS PROBLEM THIS CONSUMER PAIN POINT THEY CREATED SOME SMALL CHANGE WHICH THEY CALL FAKKA WHICH LITERALLY SITS AND IS GIVEN
PaulKempRobertson_2013G IN THE U S WERE SAYING THAT THEY 'RE COMFORTABLE USING AN INDEPENDENT OR BRANDED CURRENCY SO THAT 'S GETTING REALLY INTERESTING HERE A REALLY INTERESTING DYNAMIC GOING ON
PaulKempRobertson_2013G AND YOU THINK CORPORATIONS SHOULD START TAKING THEIR ASSETS AND THINKING OF THEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND TRADING THEM AND YOU THINK IS IT MUCH OF A LEAP IT SEEMS FARFETCHED BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT
PaulKempRobertson_2013G IN AMERICA IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY THERE WERE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED CORPORATIONS ISSUING BANKNOTES THERE WERE EIGHT THOUSAND KINDS OF NOTES IN AMERICA AND THE ONLY THING THAT STOPPED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED FOUR PERCENT OF THE SUPPLY AND THE ONLY THING THAT STOPPED IT WAS THE CIVIL WAR
PaulKempRobertson_2013G BREAKING OUT AND THE GOVERNMENT SUDDENLY WANTED TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE MONEY SO GOVERNMENT MONEY WAR NOTHING CHANGES THERE THEN
PaulKempRobertson_2013G SO I THINK YOU KNOW WILL WE BE STANDING ON STAGE
PaulKempRobertson_2013G BUYING A COFFEE ORGANIC FAIR TRADE COFFEE NEXT YEAR USING TED FLORINS OR TED SHILLINGS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
