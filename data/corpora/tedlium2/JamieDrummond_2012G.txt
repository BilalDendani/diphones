JamieDrummond_2012G@25.6:43.89 BUT CERTAINLY THE MOST ANTICIPATED YEAR IN ALL HUMAN HISTORY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND REMEMBER THAT Y TWO K THE DOTCOM BUBBLE STRESSING ABOUT WHOSE PARTY YOU 'RE GOING TO GO TO AS THE CLOCK STRIKES MIDNIGHT BEFORE THE CHAMPAGNE GOES FLAT AND THEN THERE 'S THAT
JamieDrummond_2012G@55.27:66.14 WELL AMAZINGLY FOR ONCE OUR WORLD LEADERS ACTUALLY LIVED UP TO THAT MILLENNIUM MOMENT AND BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AGREED TO SOME PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY STUFF
JamieDrummond_2012G@66.88:72.33 VISIONARY MEASURABLE LONG TERM TARGETS CALLED THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS
JamieDrummond_2012G@72.33:84.09 NOW I 'M SURE YOU ALL KEEP A COPY OF THE GOALS UNDER YOUR PILLOW OR BY THE BEDSIDE TABLE BUT JUST IN CASE YOU DON 'T AND YOUR MEMORY NEEDS SOME JOGGING THE DEAL AGREED THEN GOES LIKE THIS
JamieDrummond_2012G@101.66:115.88 WE 'RE APPROACHING TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN SO WE 'D BETTER ASSESS HOW ARE WE DOING ON THESE GOALS BUT WE 'VE ALSO GOT TO DECIDE DO WE LIKE SUCH GLOBAL GOALS SOME PEOPLE DON 'T AND IF WE LIKE THEM WE 'VE GOT TO DECIDE WHAT WE WANT TO DO ON THESE GOALS GOING FORWARD
JamieDrummond_2012G@115.92:120.53 WHAT DOES THE WORLD WANT TO DO TOGETHER WE 'VE GOT TO DECIDE A PROCESS BY WHICH WE DECIDE
JamieDrummond_2012G@120.53:137.63 WELL I DEFINITELY THINK THESE GOALS ARE WORTH BUILDING ON AND SEEING THROUGH AND HERE 'S JUST A FEW REASONS WHY INCREDIBLE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR POLITICAL LEADERS PHILANTHROPISTS AND AMAZING GRASSROOTS ACTIVISTS ACROSS THE DEVELOPING WORLD BUT ALSO
JamieDrummond_2012G@137.63:148.06 TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE MARCHED IN THE STREETS OF EDINBURGH OUTSIDE THIS VERY BUILDING FOR MAKE POVERTY HISTORY ALL TOGETHER THEY ACHIEVED THESE RESULTS
JamieDrummond_2012G@155.87:173.44 VACCINATED SO MANY THAT FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION LIVES WILL BE SAVED AND COMBINED THIS IS GOING TO RESULT IN TWO MILLION FEWER CHILDREN DYING EVERY YEAR LAST YEAR THAN IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND THAT 'S FIVE THOUSAND FEWER KIDS DYING EVERY DAY TEN TIMES YOU LOT NOT DEAD
JamieDrummond_2012G@173.44:176.25 EVERY DAY BECAUSE OF ALL OF THESE PARTNERSHIPS
JamieDrummond_2012G@176.25:194.98 SO I THINK THIS IS AMAZING LIVING PROOF OF PROGRESS THAT MORE PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT BUT THE CHALLENGE OF COMMUNICATING THIS KIND OF GOOD NEWS IS PROBABLY THE SUBJECT OF A DIFFERENT TEDTALK ANYWAY FOR NOW ANYONE INVOLVED IN GETTING THESE RESULTS THANK YOU I THINK THIS PROVED THESE GOALS ARE WORTH IT BUT THERE 'S STILL A LOT OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS
JamieDrummond_2012G@194.98:212.01 STILL SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION CHILDREN DIE EVERY YEAR OF PREVENTABLE TREATABLE DISEASES AND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION KIDS ARE MALNOURISHED TO THE POINT OF STUNTING A HORRIBLE TERM WHICH MEANS PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE LIFELONG IMPAIRMENT SO THERE 'S PLAINLY A LOT MORE TO DO ON THE GOALS WE 'VE GOT
JamieDrummond_2012G@212.61:231.13 BUT THEN A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THERE ARE THINGS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE ORIGINAL PACKAGE THAT WEREN 'T AGREED BACK THEN THAT SHOULD NOW BE INCLUDED LIKE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT TARGETS NATURAL RESOURCE GOVERNANCE TARGETS ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY TO KNOWLEDGE EQUITY FIGHTING CORRUPTION ALL OF THIS IS MEASURABLE AND COULD BE IN THE NEW GOALS
JamieDrummond_2012G@231.13:236.38 BUT THE KEY THING HERE IS WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE IN THE NEW GOALS WHAT DO YOU WANT
JamieDrummond_2012G@254.53:271.78 WELL AS WE GATHER HERE IN EDINBURGH TECHNOCRATS APPOINTED BY THE U N AND CERTAIN GOVERNMENTS WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS ARE BUSYING THEMSELVES DESIGNING A NEW PACKAGE OF GOALS AND CURRENTLY THEY 'RE DOING THAT THROUGH PRETTY MUCH THE SAME OLD LATE TWENTIETH CENTURY TOP DOWN ELITE CLOSED PROCESS
JamieDrummond_2012G@271.78:280.59 BUT OF COURSE SINCE THEN THE WEB AND MOBILE TELEPHONY ALONG WITH UBIQUITOUS REALITY TV FORMATS HAVE SPREAD ALL AROUND THE WORLD
JamieDrummond_2012G@280.59:291.84 SO WHAT WE 'D LIKE TO PROPOSE IS THAT WE USE THEM TO INVOLVE PEOPLE FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD IN AN HISTORIC FIRST THE WORLD 'S FIRST TRULY GLOBAL POLL AND CONSULTATION
JamieDrummond_2012G@291.84:303.4 WHERE EVERYONE EVERYWHERE HAS AN EQUAL VOICE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME I MEAN WOULDN 'T IT BE A HUGE HISTORIC MISSED OPPORTUNITY NOT TO DO THIS GIVEN THAT WE CAN
JamieDrummond_2012G@303.4:316.61 THERE 'S HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF YOUR AID DOLLARS AT STAKE TENS OF MILLIONS OF LIVES OR DEATHS AT STAKE AND I 'D ARGUE THE SECURITY AND FUTURE OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY IS ALSO AT STAKE
JamieDrummond_2012G@316.61:325.52 SO IF YOU 'RE WITH ME I 'D SAY THERE 'S THREE ESSENTIAL STEPS IN THIS CROWDSOURCING CAMPAIGN COLLECTING CONNECTING AND COMMITTING
JamieDrummond_2012G@325.52:344.22 SO FIRST OF ALL WE 'VE GOT TO GROUND THIS CAMPAIGN IN CORE POLLING DATA LET 'S GO INTO EVERY COUNTRY THAT WILL LET US IN ASK ONE THOUSAND AND ONE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT THE NEW GOALS TO BE MAKING SPECIAL EFFORTS TO REACH THE POOREST THOSE WITHOUT ACCESS TO MODERN TECHNOLOGY AND LET 'S MAKE SURE THAT THEIR VIEWS ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE GOALS GOING FORWARD
JamieDrummond_2012G@344.22:363.42 THEN WE 'VE GOT TO COMMISSION A BASELINE SURVEY TO MAKE SURE WE CAN MONITOR AND PROGRESS THE GOALS GOING FORWARD THE ORIGINAL GOALS DIDN 'T REALLY HAVE GOOD BASELINE SURVEY DATA AND WE 'RE GOING TO NEED THE HELP OF BIG DATA THROUGH ALL OF THIS PROCESS TO MAKE SURE WE CAN REALLY MONITOR THE PROGRESS AND THEN WE 'VE GOT TO CONNECT WITH THE BIG CROWD
JamieDrummond_2012G@363.42:380.37 NOW HERE WE SEE THE ROLE FOR AN UNPRECEDENTED COALITION OF SOCIAL MEDIA GIANTS AND UPSTARTS TELECOMS COMPANIES REALITY TV SHOW FORMATS GAMING COMPANIES TELECOMS ALL OF THEM TOGETHER IN KIND OF THEIR WE ARE THE WORLD MOMENT
JamieDrummond_2012G@380.37:388.48 COULD THEY COME TOGETHER AND HELP THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS GET REBRANDED INTO THE MILLENNIAL GENERATION 'S GOALS
JamieDrummond_2012G@388.48:405.43 AND IF JUST FIVE PERCENT OF THE FIVE BILLION PLUS WHO ARE CURRENTLY CONNECTED MADE A COMMENT AND THAT COMMENT TURNED INTO A COMMITMENT WE COULD CROWDSOURCE A FORCE OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD TO HELP SEE THESE GOALS THROUGH IF WE HAVE THIS COLLECTED DATA
JamieDrummond_2012G@405.45:414.28 AND THIS CONNECTED CROWD BASED UPON OUR EXPERIENCE OF CAMPAIGNING AND GETTING WORLD LEADERS TO COMMIT I THINK WORLD LEADERS WILL COMMIT TO MOST OF THE CROWDSOURCED RECOMMENDATIONS
JamieDrummond_2012G@414.28:426.56 BUT THE QUESTION REALLY IS THROUGH THIS PROCESS WILL WE ALL HAVE BECOME COMMITTED AND IF WE ARE ARE WE READY TO ITERATE MONITOR AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK MAKE SURE THESE PROMISES ARE REALLY DELIVERING RESULTS
JamieDrummond_2012G@426.56:430.16 WELL THERE 'S SOME FANTASTIC EXAMPLES HERE TO SCALE UP
JamieDrummond_2012G@430.16:447.34 MOSTLY PILOTED WITHIN AFRICA ACTUALLY THERE 'S OPEN DATA KENYA WHICH GEOCODES AND CROWDSOURCES INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE PROJECTS ARE ARE THEY DELIVERING RESULTS OFTEN THEY 'RE NOT IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND USHAHIDI WHICH MEANS WITNESS IN SWAHILI WHICH GEOCODES AND CROWDSOURCES INFORMATION
JamieDrummond_2012G@447.35:455.77 IN COMPLEX EMERGENCIES TO HELP TARGET RESPONSES THIS IS SOME OF THE MOST EXCITING STUFF IN DEVELOPMENT AND DEMOCRACY
JamieDrummond_2012G@455.83:469.71 WHERE CITIZENS ON THE EDGE OF A NETWORK ARE HELPING TO FORCE OPEN THE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BIG GLOBAL AID PROMISES AND VAGUE STUFF UP AT THE TOP REALLY DELIVERS FOR PEOPLE AT A GRASSROOTS LEVEL AND INVERTS THAT PYRAMID
JamieDrummond_2012G@469.71:480.52 THIS OPENNESS THIS FORCING OPENNESS IS KEY AND IF IT WASN 'T ENTIRELY TRANSPARENT ALREADY I SHOULD BE OPEN I 'VE GOT A COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT AGENDA
JamieDrummond_2012G@480.52:493.05 LONG TERM TRENDS SUGGEST THAT THIS CENTURY IS GOING TO BE A TOUGH PLACE TO LIVE WITH POPULATION INCREASES CONSUMPTION PATTERNS INCREASING AND CONFLICT OVER SCARCE NATURAL RESOURCES
JamieDrummond_2012G@493.05:509.35 AND LOOK AT THE STATE OF GLOBAL POLITICS TODAY LOOK AT THE RIO EARTH SUMMIT THAT HAPPENED JUST LAST WEEK OR THE MEXICAN G TWENTY ALSO LAST WEEK BOTH IF WE 'RE HONEST A BUST OUR WORLD LEADERS OUR GLOBAL POLITICS CURRENTLY CAN 'T GET IT DONE
JamieDrummond_2012G@510.26:517.53 THEY NEED OUR HELP THEY NEED THE CAVALRY AND THE CAVALRY 'S NOT GOING TO COME FROM MARS IT 'S GOT TO COME FROM US
JamieDrummond_2012G@517.53:536.66 AND I SEE THIS PROCESS OF DECIDING DEMOCRATICALLY IN A BOTTOM UP FASHION WHAT THE WORLD WANTS TO WORK ON TOGETHER AS ONE VITAL MEANS BY WHICH WE CAN CROWDSOURCE THE FORCE TO REALLY BUILD THAT CONSTITUENCY THAT 'S GOING TO REINVIGORATE GLOBAL GOVERNANCE IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY I STARTED
JamieDrummond_2012G@546.24:564.61 IT WAS A NAIVE THOUGHT IN MANY PEOPLE 'S MINDS AND IT 'S TRUE IT WAS JUST A T SHIRT SLOGAN THAT WORKED FOR THE MOMENT BUT LOOK THE EMPIRICAL CONDITION OF LIVING UNDER A DOLLAR AND TWENTY FIVE IS TRENDING DOWN AND LOOK WHERE IT GETS TO BY TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTY IT 'S GETTING NEAR ZERO
JamieDrummond_2012G@569.59:587.49 BUT RECENTLY ALSO IN AFRICA POVERTY RATES ARE BEING REDUCED IT WILL GET HARDER AS WE GET TOWARDS ZERO AS THE POOR WILL BE INCREASINGLY LOCATED IN POST CONFLICT FRAGILE STATES OR MAYBE IN MIDDLE INCOME STATES WHERE THEY DON 'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE MARGINALIZED BUT I 'M CONFIDENT WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF POLITICAL
JamieDrummond_2012G@587.59:596.72 CAMPAIGNING AND CREATIVE AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION COMBINED WORKING TOGETHER MORE AND MORE AS ONE I THINK WE CAN GET THIS AND OTHER GOALS
JamieDrummond_2012G@625.34:632.62 FIVE THOUSAND IS THAT THE NUMBER JAMIE DRUMMOND FEWER CHILDREN EVERY DAY CA FIVE THOUSAND FEWER CHILDREN DYING EVERY DAY I MEAN IT DWARFS
JamieDrummond_2012G@637.79:639.46 THIS MUST DRIVE YOU CRAZY
JamieDrummond_2012G@665.92:682.27 CREATIVELY WE 'VE FAILED TO COMMUNICATE THIS SUCCESS SO FAR IF THOSE KINDS OF EFFORTS JUST COULD MULTIPLY THEIR VOICE AND AMPLIFY IT AT THE KEY MOMENTS I KNOW FOR A FACT WE 'D GET BETTER POLICY THE MEXICAN G TWENTY NEED NOT HAVE BEEN A BUST RIO IF ANYONE CARES ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT
JamieDrummond_2012G@682.27:697.12 NEED NOT HAVE BEEN A BUST OKAY BUT THESE CONFERENCES ARE GOING ON AND I KNOW PEOPLE GET SKEPTICAL AND CYNICAL ABOUT THE BIG GLOBAL SUMMITS AND THE PROMISES AND THEIR NEVER BEING KEPT BUT ACTUALLY THE BITS THAT ARE ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE AND WHAT THE POLITICIANS NEED IS MORE PERMISSION FROM THE PUBLIC
