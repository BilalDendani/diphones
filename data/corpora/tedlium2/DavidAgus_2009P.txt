DavidAgus_2009P I'M A CANCER DOCTOR AND I WALKED OUT OF MY OFFICE AND WALKED BY THE PHARMACY IN THE HOSPITAL THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO AND THIS WAS THE COVER OF FORTUNE MAGAZINE SITTING IN THE WINDOW OF THE PHARMACY
DavidAgus_2009P WHERE HIS PARENTS DROVE HIM FROM NEW YORK CITY TO UPSTATE NEW YORK TO GET AN EXPERIMENTAL THERAPY FOR AT THE TIME HODGKIN 'S DISEASE WHICH SAVED HIS LIFE HE MAKES REMARKABLE POINTS HERE
DavidAgus_2009P AND THE POINT OF THE ARTICLE WAS THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN REDUCTIONIST IN OUR VIEW OF BIOLOGY IN OUR VIEW OF CANCER
DavidAgus_2009P FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS WE HAVE FOCUSED ON TREATING THE INDIVIDUAL GENE IN UNDERSTANDING CANCER NOT IN CONTROLLING CANCER
DavidAgus_2009P SO THIS IS AN ASTOUNDING TABLE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SOBERS US IN OUR FIELD EVERYDAY IN THAT OBVIOUSLY WE'VE MADE REMARKABLE IMPACTS ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE BUT LOOK AT CANCER THE DEATH RATE IN CANCER IN OVER FIFTY YEARS
DavidAgus_2009P CHANGED WE'VE MADE SMALL WINS IN DISEASES LIKE CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA WHERE WE HAVE A PILL THAT CAN PUT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF PEOPLE IN REMISSION BUT IN GENERAL WE HAVEN'T MADE AN IMPACT AT ALL IN THE WAR ON CANCER
DavidAgus_2009P SO WHAT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU TODAY IS A LITTLE BIT OF WHY I THINK THAT'S THE CASE AND THEN GO OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE
DavidAgus_2009P AND TELL YOU WHERE I THINK IT'S GOING WHERE A NEW APPROACH THAT WE HOPE TO PUSH FORWARD IN TERMS OF TREATING CANCER BECAUSE THIS IS WRONG
DavidAgus_2009P SO WHAT IS CANCER FIRST OF ALL WELL IF ONE HAS A MASS OR AN ABNORMAL BLOOD VALUE YOU GO TO A DOCTOR
DavidAgus_2009P THEY STICK A NEEDLE IN THEY WAY WE MAKE THE DIAGNOSIS TODAY IS BY PATTERN RECOGNITION DOES IT LOOK NORMAL
DavidAgus_2009P DOES IT LOOK ABNORMAL SO THAT PATHOLOGIST IS JUST LIKE LOOKING AT THIS PLASTIC BOTTLE THIS IS A NORMAL CELL THIS IS A CANCER CELL
DavidAgus_2009P THAT IS THE STATE OF THE ART TODAY IN DIAGNOSING CANCER THERE'S NO MOLECULAR TEST
DavidAgus_2009P YOU KNOW I KNOW VERY WELL AS A CANCER DOCTOR I CAN'T TREAT ADVANCED CANCER SO AS AN ASIDE I FIRMLY BELIEVE
DavidAgus_2009P IN THE FIELD OF TRYING TO IDENTIFY CANCER EARLY IT IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN START TO FIGHT CANCER IS BY CATCHING IT EARLY
DavidAgus_2009P WE CAN PREVENT MOST CANCERS YOU KNOW THE PREVIOUS TALK ALLUDED TO PREVENTING HEART DISEASE WE COULD DO THE SAME IN CANCER
DavidAgus_2009P CO FOUNDED A COMPANY CALLED NAVIGENICS WHERE IF YOU SPIT INTO A TUBE AND WE CAN LOOK LOOK AT THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY GENETIC
DavidAgus_2009P MARKERS FOR DISEASE ALL OF WHICH ARE DELAYABLE IN MANY OF THE CANCERS YOU START TO IDENTIFY WHAT YOU COULD GET AND THEN WE CAN START TO WORK TO PREVENT THEM
DavidAgus_2009P SO THE THING ABOUT CANCER IS THAT IT'S A DISEASE OF THE AGED WHY IS IT A DISEASE OF THE AGED BECAUSE EVOLUTION DOESN'T CARE ABOUT US AFTER WE'VE HAD OUR CHILDREN
DavidAgus_2009P SAID IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD THEIR PROGENY SO IF YOU LOOK AT CANCERS IT IS VERY RARE EXTREMELY RARE TO HAVE CANCER IN A CHILD
DavidAgus_2009P ON THE ORDER OF THOUSANDS OF CASES A YEAR
DavidAgus_2009P AS ONE GETS OLDER VERY VERY COMMON
DavidAgus_2009P WHY IS IT HARD TO TREAT BECAUSE IT'S HETEROGENEOUS AND THAT'S THE PERFECT SUBSTRATE FOR EVOLUTION WITHIN THE CANCER
DavidAgus_2009P IT STARTS TO SELECT OUT FOR THOSE BAD AGGRESSIVE CELLS WHAT WE CALL CLONAL SELECTION
DavidAgus_2009P BUT IF WE START TO UNDERSTAND THAT CANCER ISN'T JUST A MOLECULAR DEFECT IT'S SOMETHING MORE
DavidAgus_2009P GET TO NEW WAYS OF TREATING IT AS I'LL SHOW YOU SO ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN CANCER IS THAT RIGHT NOW WE DESCRIBE IT BY A NUMBER OF ADJECTIVES SYMPTOMS
DavidAgus_2009P TIRED I'M BLOATED I HAVE PAIN ETC YOU THEN HAVE SOME ANATOMIC DESCRIPTIONS YOU GET THAT CAT SCAN THERE'S A THREE CENTIMETER MASS IN THE LIVER
DavidAgus_2009P YOU THEN HAVE SOME BODY PART DESCRIPTIONS IT'S IN THE LIVER IN THE BREAST IN THE PROSTATE AND THAT'S ABOUT IT SO
DavidAgus_2009P OUR DICTIONARY FOR DESCRIBING CANCER IS VERY VERY POOR IT'S BASICALLY SYMPTOMS IT'S MANIFESTATIONS OF A DISEASE
DavidAgus_2009P WHAT'S EXCITING IS THAT OVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS THE GOVERNMENT HAS SPENT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND THEY'VE ALLOCATED ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS TO WHAT WE CALL THE CANCER GENOME ATLAS PROJECT
DavidAgus_2009P HASN'T CHANGED IN OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS IT IS ABSOLUTELY ARCHAIC THAT WE CALL CANCER BY PROSTATE BY BREAST BY
DavidAgus_2009P MUSCLE IT MAKES NO SENSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT SO OBVIOUSLY THE TECHNOLOGY IS HERE TODAY AND OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS THAT WILL CHANGE YOU WILL NO LONGER GO TO A BREAST CANCER CLINIC
DavidAgus_2009P YOU WILL GO TO A HER TWO AMPLIFIED CLINIC OR AN EGFR ACTIVATED CLINIC AND THEY WILL GO TO SOME OF THE PATHOGENIC LESIONS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN CAUSING THIS INDIVIDUAL CANCER SO HOPEFULLY WE WILL GO FROM BEING THE ART OF MEDICINE
DavidAgus_2009P WHEN ONE IS EXPOSED TO H ONE N ONE YOU TAKE TAMIFLU AND YOU CAN REMARKABLY DECREASE THE SEVERITY OF SYMPTOMS AND PREVENT MANY OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE DISEASE WHY BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT YOU
DavidAgus_2009P AND WE KNOW HOW TO TREAT IT ALTHOUGH WE CAN'T MAKE VACCINE IN THIS COUNTRY BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY THE CANCER GENOME ATLAS IS COMING OUT NOW THE FIRST CANCER WAS DONE WHICH WAS BRAIN CANCER
DavidAgus_2009P IN THE NEXT MONTH THE END OF DECEMBER YOU'LL SEE OVARIAN CANCER AND THEN LUNG CANCER WILL COME SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER
DavidAgus_2009P THERE'S ALSO A FIELD OF PROTEOMICS THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A FEW MINUTES WHICH I THINK IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT LEVEL IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING AND CLASSIFYING DISEASE
DavidAgus_2009P BUT REMEMBER I'M NOT PUSHING GENOMICS PROTEOMICS TO BE A REDUCTIONIST I'M DOING IT SO WE CAN IDENTIFY WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST
DavidAgus_2009P MOST OF THE DOLLARS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OF A PERSON 'S LIFE WE SPEND VERY LITTLE IF ANY DOLLARS IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST IF YOU COULD START TO MOVE THAT
DavidAgus_2009P TO IDENTIFY WHAT YOU'RE UP AGAINST YOU'RE GOING TO DO THINGS A HELL OF A LOT BETTER IF WE COULD EVEN TAKE IT ONE STEP FURTHER AND PREVENT DISEASE WE CAN TAKE IT
DavidAgus_2009P AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU IT'S WRONG SO THE WEBSITE OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE SAYS THAT CANCER IS A GENETIC DISEASE
DavidAgus_2009P THE WEBSITE SAYS IF YOU LOOK THERE'S AN INDIVIDUAL MUTATION AND MAYBE A SECOND AND MAYBE A THIRD AND THAT IS CANCER BUT AS A CANCER
DavidAgus_2009P THIS IS WHAT I SEE THIS ISN'T A GENETIC DISEASE SO THERE YOU SEE IT'S A LIVER WITH COLON CANCER IN IT AND YOU SEE INTO THE MICROSCOPE A LYMPH NODE WHERE CANCER HAS INVADED YOU SEE A CAT SCAN
DavidAgus_2009P WHERE CANCER IS IN THE LIVER CANCER IS AN INTERACTION OF A CELL THAT NO LONGER IS UNDER GROWTH CONTROL
DavidAgus_2009P WITH THE ENVIRONMENT IT'S NOT IN THE ABSTRACT IT'S THE INTERACTION WITH THE ENVIRONMENT IT'S WHAT WE CALL A SYSTEM
DavidAgus_2009P THE GOAL OF ME AS A CANCER DOCTOR IS NOT TO UNDERSTAND CANCER AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM OVER THE LAST FIVE DECADES IS THAT WE HAVE STRIVED TO UNDERSTAND CANCER
DavidAgus_2009P THE GOAL IS TO CONTROL CANCER AND THAT IS A VERY DIFFERENT OPTIMIZATION SCHEME A VERY DIFFERENT STRATEGY FOR ALL OF US
DavidAgus_2009P I GOT UP AT THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF CANCER RESEARCH ONE OF THE BIG CANCER RESEARCH MEETINGS WITH TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE AND I SAID WE'VE MADE A MISTAKE
DavidAgus_2009P ALL MADE A MISTAKE MYSELF INCLUDED BY FOCUSING DOWN BY BEING A REDUCTIONIST WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT THERE WERE HISSES IN THE AUDIENCE PEOPLE GOT UPSET
DavidAgus_2009P BUT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD YOU KNOW I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO MEET DANNY HILLIS A FEW YEARS AGO WE WERE PUSHED TOGETHER AND NEITHER ONE OF US REALLY WANTED TO MEET THE OTHER
DavidAgus_2009P I SAID DO I REALLY WANT TO MEET A GUY FROM DISNEY WHO DESIGNED COMPUTERS AND HE WAS SAYING DOES HE REALLY WANT TO MEET ANOTHER DOCTOR BUT PEOPLE PREVAILED ON US AND WE GOT TOGETHER AND IT'S BEEN TRANSFORMATIVE IN WHAT I DO ABSOLUTELY
DavidAgus_2009P WE HAVE DESIGNED AND WE HAVE WORKED ON THE MODELING AND MUCH OF THESE IDEAS CAME FROM DANNY AND FROM HIS TEAM
DavidAgus_2009P THE MODELING OF CANCER IN THE BODY AS COMPLEX SYSTEM AND I'LL SHOW YOU SOME DATA THERE WHERE I REALLY THINK IT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND A NEW WAY TO
DavidAgus_2009P THE KEY IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE VARIABLES AND YOU LOOK AT THIS DATA YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE DATA INPUTS YOU KNOW IF I MEASURED YOUR TEMPERATURE
DavidAgus_2009P OVER THIRTY DAYS AND I ASKED WHAT WAS THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE AND IT CAME BACK AT NINETY EIGHT POINT SEVEN I WOULD SAY GREAT BUT IF
DavidAgus_2009P DURING ONE OF THOSE DAYS YOUR TEMPERATURE SPIKED TO ONE HUNDRED AND TWO FOR SIX HOURS AND YOU TOOK TYLENOL AND GOT BETTER ETC I WOULD TOTALLY MISS
DavidAgus_2009P SO ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS IN MEDICINE IS THAT YOU AND I AND ALL OF US WE GO TO OUR DOCTOR ONCE A YEAR WE HAVE DISCRETE DATA ELEMENTS WE DON'T HAVE A TIME FUNCTION ON THEM
DavidAgus_2009P EARLIER IT WAS REFERRED TO THIS DIRECT LIFE DEVICE YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR TWO AND A HALF MONTHS IT'S A STAGGERING DEVICE NOT BECAUSE IT TELLS ME HOW MANY KILOCALORIES I DO EVERY DAY
DavidAgus_2009P BUT BECAUSE IT LOOKS OVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS WHAT I'VE DONE IN A DAY AND I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT FOR THREE HOURS I'M SITTING AT MY DESK AND I'M NOT MOVING AT ALL
DavidAgus_2009P AND A LOT OF THE FUNCTIONS IN THE DATA THAT WE HAVE AS INPUT SYSTEMS HERE ARE REALLY DIFFERENT THAN WE
DavidAgus_2009P SO THE STATES ARE EQUIVALENT CLASSES OF HISTORY AND THE CANCER PATIENT THE INPUT IS THE ENVIRONMENT THE DIET THE TREATMENT THE GENETIC MUTATIONS
DavidAgus_2009P THE OUTPUT ARE OUR SYMPTOMS DO WE HAVE PAIN IS THE CANCER GROWING DO WE FEEL BLOATED ETC MOST OF THAT STATE
DavidAgus_2009P IS HIDDEN SO WHAT WE DO IN OUR FIELD IS WE CHANGE AND INPUT WE GIVE AGGRESSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY AND WE SAY DID THAT OUTPUT GET BETTER DID THAT PAIN IMPROVE ETC
DavidAgus_2009P AND SO THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST ONE SYSTEM IT'S MULTIPLE SYSTEMS ON MULTIPLE SCALES IT'S A SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS
DavidAgus_2009P AND SO WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT EMERGENT SYSTEMS YOU CAN LOOK AT A NEURON UNDER A MICROSCOPE A NEURON UNDER THE MICROSCOPE IS VERY ELEGANT WITH LITTLE THINGS STICKING OUT AND LITTLE THINGS OVER HERE BUT WHEN YOU START TO PUT THEM TOGETHER
DavidAgus_2009P IN A COMPLEX SYSTEM AND YOU START TO SEE THAT IT BECOMES A BRAIN AND THAT BRAIN CAN CREATE INTELLIGENCE
DavidAgus_2009P WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THE BODY AND CANCER IS STARTING TO MODEL IT LIKE A COMPLEX SYSTEM WELL THE BAD NEWS IS THAT THESE
DavidAgus_2009P ROBUST AND ROBUST IS A KEY WORD EMERGENT SYSTEMS ARE VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND IN DETAIL THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU CAN MANIPULATE THEM
DavidAgus_2009P YOU CAN TRY TO CONTROL THEM WITHOUT THAT FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF EVERY COMPONENT ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL CLINICAL TRIALS IN CANCER
DavidAgus_2009P CAME OUT IN FEBRUARY IN THE THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE WHERE THEY TOOK WOMEN WHO WERE PRE MENOPAUSAL WITH BREAST CANCER SO ABOUT THE WORST KIND OF BREAST CANCER YOU CAN GET
DavidAgus_2009P GOTTEN THEIR CHEMOTHERAPY AND THEN THEY RANDOMIZED THEM WHERE HALF GOT PLACEBO AND HALF GOT A DRUG CALLED ZOLEDRONIC ACID THAT BUILDS BONE IT'S USED TO TREAT OSTEOPOROSIS AND THEY GOT THAT TWICE A YEAR
DavidAgus_2009P REDUCED OCCURRENCE OF CANCER BY A DRUG THAT DOESN'T EVEN TOUCH THE CANCER SO THE NOTION YOU CHANGE THE SOIL
DavidAgus_2009P THE SEED DOESN'T GROW AS WELL YOU CHANGE THAT SYSTEM AND YOU COULD HAVE A MARKED EFFECT ON THE CANCER NOBODY HAS EVER SHOWN AND THIS WILL BE SHOCKING NOBODY HAS EVER SHOWN THAT MOST CHEMOTHERAPY ACTUALLY TOUCHES A CANCER CELL
DavidAgus_2009P IT'S NEVER BEEN SHOWN THERE'S ALL THESE ELEGANT WORK IN THE TISSUE CULTURE DISHES THAT IF YOU GIVE THIS CANCER DRUG YOU CAN DO THIS EFFECT TO THE CELL BUT THE DOSES IN THOSE DISHES ARE NOWHERE NEAR THE DOSES THAT HAPPEN IN THE BODY
DavidAgus_2009P IF I GIVE A WOMAN WITH BREAST CANCER A DRUG CALLED TAXOL EVERY THREE WEEKS WHICH IS THE STANDARD ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF WOMEN WITH METASTATIC CANCER HAVE A GREAT RESPONSE
DavidAgus_2009P THEY THEN RECUR I GIVE THEM THAT SAME DRUG EVERY WEEK ANOTHER THIRTY PERCENT WILL RESPOND THEY THEN RECUR I GIVE THEM THAT SAME DRUG OVER NINETY SIX HRS BY CONTINUOUS INFUSION
DavidAgus_2009P ANOTHER TWENTY OR THIRTY PERCENT WILL RESPOND SO YOU CAN'T TELL ME IT'S WORKING BY THE SAME MECHANISM IN ALL THREE SIZE IT'S NOT
DavidAgus_2009P WE HAVE NO IDEA THE MECHANISM SO THE IDEA THAT CHEMOTHERAPY MAY JUST BE DISRUPTING THAT COMPLEX SYSTEM
DavidAgus_2009P JUST LIKE BUILDING BONE DISRUPTED THAT SYSTEM AND REDUCED RECURRENCE CHEMOTHERAPY MAY WORK BY THAT SAME EXACT WAY THE WILD THING ABOUT THAT TRIAL
DavidAgus_2009P ALSO WAS IT REDUCED NEW PRIMARIES SO NEW CANCERS BY THIRTY PERCENT ALSO
DavidAgus_2009P SO
DavidAgus_2009P THE PROBLEM IS YOURS AND MINE ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS ARE CHANGING THEY'RE DYNAMIC I MEAN THIS IS A SCARY SLIDE NOT TO TAKE AN ASIDE BUT IT LOOKS AT OBESITY IN THE WORLD AND I'M SORRY IF YOU CAN'T READ THE NUMBERS THEIR KIND OF SMALL
DavidAgus_2009P BUT IF YOU START TO LOOK AT IT THAT RED THAT DARK COLOR THERE MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION OF THOSE COUNTRIES ARE OBESE
DavidAgus_2009P LOOK A DECADE AGO LOOK TWO DECADES AGO MARKEDLY DIFFERENT SO OUR SYSTEMS TODAY ARE DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT THAN A DECADE OR TWO AGO SO THE DISEASES WE HAVE TODAY
DavidAgus_2009P WHICH REFLECT PATTERNS IN THE SYSTEM OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES ARE GOING TO CHANGE DRAMATICALLY OVER THE NEXT DECADE OR SO BASED ON THINGS LIKE THIS
DavidAgus_2009P SO THIS PICTURE
DavidAgus_2009P ALTHOUGH IT IS BEAUTIFUL IS A FORTY GIGABYTE
DavidAgus_2009P PICTURE OF THE WHOLE PROTEOME SO THIS IS A DROP OF BLOOD THAT HAS GONE THROUGH A SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNET AND WE'RE ABLE TO GET RESOLUTION WHERE WE CAN START TO SEE ALL OF THE PROTEINS IN THE BODY WE CAN START TO SEE THAT SYSTEM
DavidAgus_2009P EACH OF THE RED DOTS ARE WHERE A PROTEIN HAS ACTUALLY BEEN IDENTIFIED THE POWER OF THESE MAGNETS THE POWER OF WHAT WE CAN DO HERE IS THAT WE CAN SEE AN INDIVIDUAL NEUTRON WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY
DavidAgus_2009P THIS IS STUFF WE'RE DOING WITH DANNY HILLIS AND A GROUP CALLED APPLIED PROTEOMICS WHERE WE CAN START SEE INDIVIDUAL NEUTRON DIFFERENCES
DavidAgus_2009P SO THIS IS A WOMAN FORTY SIX YEARS OLD
DavidAgus_2009P WHO HAD RECURRENT LUNG CANCER IT WAS IN HER BRAIN IN HER LUNGS IN HER LIVER SHE HAD GOTTEN CARBOPLATIN TAXOL CARBOPLATIN
DavidAgus_2009P EVERY DRUG WE HAVE SHE HAD GOTTEN AND THAT DISEASE CONTINUED TO GROW SHE HAD THREE KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF TWELVE
DavidAgus_2009P AND THIS IS HER CAT SCAN AND SO WHAT THIS IS IS WE'RE TAKING A CROSS SECTION OF HER BODY HERE AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE MIDDLE THERE IS HER HEART
DavidAgus_2009P AND TO THE SIDE OF HER HEART ON THE LEFT THERE IS THIS LARGE TUMOR THAT WILL INVADE AND WILL KILL HER UNTREATED IN A MATTER OF WEEKS SHE GOES ON A PILL A DAY
DavidAgus_2009P THAT TARGETS A PATHWAY AND AGAIN I'M NOT SURE IF THIS PATHWAY WAS IN THE SYSTEM IN THE CANCER BUT IT TARGETED A PATHWAY AND A MONTH LATER POW
DavidAgus_2009P SIX MONTHS LATER IT'S STILL GONE THAT CANCER RECURRED AND SHE PASSED AWAY THREE YEARS LATER FROM LUNG CANCER BUT SHE GOT THREE YEARS
DavidAgus_2009P FROM A DRUG WHOSE SYMPTOMS PREDOMINATELY WERE ACNE THAT'S ABOUT IT SO THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE
DavidAgus_2009P WOULD YOU WANT YOUR MOTHER YOUR BROTHER YOUR SISTER TO GET A PLACEBO IF THEY HAD ADVANCED LUNG CANCER AND HAD WEEKS TO LIVE
DavidAgus_2009P AND THE DRUG WENT TO THE FDA AND THE FDA SAID WITHOUT A PLACEBO HOW DO I KNOW PATIENTS ACTUALLY BENEFITED FROM THE DRUG
DavidAgus_2009P SO THE MORNING THE FDA WAS GOING TO MEET THIS WAS THE EDITORIAL IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
DavidAgus_2009P AND SO WHAT DO YOU KNOW THAT DRUG WAS APPROVED THE AMAZING THING IS ANOTHER COMPANY DID THE RIGHT SCIENTIFIC TRIAL WHERE THEY GAVE HALF PLACEBO
DavidAgus_2009P AND HALF THE DRUG AND WE LEARNED SOMETHING IMPORTANT THERE WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THEY DID IT IN SOUTH AMERICA AND CANADA WHERE IT 'S MORE ETHICAL TO GIVE PLACEBOS
DavidAgus_2009P THEY HAD TO GIVE IT ALSO IN THE U S TO GET APPROVAL SO I THINK THERE WERE THREE U S PATIENTS IN UPSTATE NEW YORK WHO WERE PART OF THE TRIAL BUT THEY DID THAT AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE NON RESPONDERS
DavidAgus_2009P LIVED MUCH LONGER AND DID BETTER THAN PEOPLE WHO GOT PLACEBO SO IT CHALLENGED EVERYTHING WE KNEW IN CANCER IS THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO GET A RESPONSE YOU DON'T NEED TO SHRINK THE DISEASE IF WE SLOW THE DISEASE
DavidAgus_2009P WE MAY HAVE MORE OF A BENEFIT ON PATIENT SURVIVAL PATIENT OUTCOME HOW THEY FEEL THAN IF WE SHRINK THE DISEASE
DavidAgus_2009P THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF I'M THIS DOC AND I GET YOUR CAT SCAN TODAY AND YOU'VE GOT A TWO CENTIMETER MASS IN YOUR LIVER AND YOU COME BACK TO ME IN THREE MONTHS AND IT'S THREE CENTIMETERS DID THAT DRUG HELP YOU OR NOT
DavidAgus_2009P HOW DO I KNOW WOULD IT HAVE BEEN TEN CENTIMETERS OR AM I GIVING YOU A DRUG WITH NO BENEFIT AND SIGNIFICANT COST SO IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM AND AGAIN THAT'S WHERE THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES
DavidAgus_2009P CAN COME IN AND SO THE GOAL OBVIOUSLY IS THAT YOU GO INTO YOUR DOCTOR 'S OFFICE WELL THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS THAT YOU PREVENT DISEASE
DavidAgus_2009P RIGHT THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS THAT YOU PREVENT ANY OF THESE THINGS FROM HAPPENING THAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE COST EFFECTIVE BEST WAY WE CAN DO THINGS TODAY
DavidAgus_2009P THERE ARE ELEVEN ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HIGH ABUNDANT AND THE LOW ABUNDANT PROTEINS SO THERE'S NO TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORLD THAT CAN SPAN ELEVEN ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE
DavidAgus_2009P AND SO A LOT OF WHAT HAS BEEN DONE WITH DANNY HILLIS AND OTHERS IS TO TRY TO BRING IN ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES TRY
DavidAgus_2009P THE EXITING THINGS THAT IS STARTING TO HAPPEN NOW IS THAT PEOPLE FROM THOSE FIELDS ARE COMING IN YESTERDAY THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE ANNOUNCED A NEW PROGRAM
DavidAgus_2009P CALLED THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES AND ONCOLOGY WHERE PHYSICISTS MATHEMATICIANS ARE BROUGHT IN TO THINK ABOUT CANCER PEOPLE WHO NEVER APPROACHED IT BEFORE DANNY AND I GOT SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THEY ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY TO TRY TO ATTACH THIS PROBLEM
DavidAgus_2009P A WHOLE NEW APPROACH INSTEAD OF GIVING HIGH DOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY BY DIFFERENT MECHANISMS TO TRY TO BRING TECHNOLOGY TO GET A PICTURE OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THE BODY SO
DavidAgus_2009P JUST FOR TWO SECONDS HOW THESE TECHNOLOGIES WORK BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND IT WHAT HAPPENS IS EVERY PROTEIN IN YOUR BODY IS CHARGED SO THE PROTEINS ARE SPRAYED IN
DavidAgus_2009P THE MAGNET SPINS THEM AROUND AND THEN THERE'S A DETECTOR AT THE END WHEN IT HIT THAT DETECTOR IS DEPENDENT ON THE MASS AND THE CHARGE
DavidAgus_2009P AND SO ACCURATELY IF THE MAGNET IS BIG ENOUGH AND YOUR RESOLUTION IS HIGH ENOUGH YOU CAN ACTUALLY DETECT ALL OF THE PROTEINS IN THE BODY AND START TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING
DavidAgus_2009P OF THE INDIVIDUAL SYSTEM AND SO AS A CANCER DOCTOR INSTEAD OF HAVING PAPER
DavidAgus_2009P IN MY CHART IN YOUR CHART AND IT BEING THIS THICK THIS IS WHAT DATA FLOW IS STARTING TO LOOK LIKE IN OUR OFFICES WHERE THAT DROP OF BLOOD IS CREATING GIGABYTES OF DATA
DavidAgus_2009P WITHOUT FUNDAMENTAL LEARNING SO TO CONCLUDE
DavidAgus_2009P WE NEED TO GET AWAY FROM REDUCTIONIST THINKING WE NEED TO START TO THINK DIFFERENTLY AND RADICALLY AND SO I IMPLORE EVERYONE HERE THINK DIFFERENTLY COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS TELL THEM TO ME OR ANYONE ELSE IN OUR FIELD
DavidAgus_2009P THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A BROAD PLATFORM OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL HELP US MOVE FORWARD AND HOPEFULLY HELP PATIENTS IN THE NEAR TERM THANK YOU VERY MUCH
