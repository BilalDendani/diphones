MarkusFischer_2011G SO WE LOOKED AT THE BIRDS AND WE TRIED TO MAKE A MODEL THAT IS POWERFUL ULTRALIGHT AND IT MUST HAVE EXCELLENT AERODYNAMIC QUALITIES THAT WOULD FLY BY ITS OWN AND ONLY BY FLAPPING ITS WINGS
MarkusFischer_2011G SO WHAT WOULD BE BETTER THAN TO USE THE HERRING GULL IN ITS FREEDOM CIRCLING AND SWOOPING OVER THE SEA AND TO USE THIS AS A ROLE MODEL
MarkusFischer_2011G SO WE BRING A TEAM TOGETHER THERE ARE GENERALISTS AND ALSO SPECIALISTS IN THE FIELD OF AERODYNAMICS IN THE FIELD OF BUILDING GLIDERS AND THE TASK WAS TO BUILD AN ULTRALIGHT INDOOR FLYING MODEL
MarkusFischer_2011G THAT IS ABLE TO FLY OVER YOUR HEADS SO BE CAREFUL LATER ON
MarkusFischer_2011G AND
MarkusFischer_2011G THE
MarkusFischer_2011G SO HERE IS ONE WITHOUT A SKIN WE HAVE A WINGSPAN OF ABOUT TWO METERS THE LENGTH IS ONE METER AND SIX AND THE WEIGHT IT IS ONLY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY GRAMS
MarkusFischer_2011G AND IT IS ALL OUT OF CARBON FIBER IN THE MIDDLE WE HAVE A MOTOR AND WE ALSO HAVE A GEAR IN IT
MarkusFischer_2011G UP
MarkusFischer_2011G AND THEN WE CAN CALCULATE THE AERODYNAMIC EFFICIENCY SO THEREFORE IT RISES UP FROM PASSIVE TORSION TO ACTIVE TORSION FROM THIRTY PERCENT UP TO EIGHTY PERCENT
MarkusFischer_2011G NEXT THING WE HAVE TO DO WE HAVE TO CONTROL AND REGULATE THE WHOLE STRUCTURE ONLY IF YOU CONTROL AND REGULATE IT YOU WILL GET THAT AERODYNAMIC EFFICIENCY SO THE OVERALL CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY IS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE WATTS
