DanDennett_2009U@13.09:19.72 GOING AROUND THE WORLD GIVING TALKS ABOUT DARWIN AND USUALLY WHAT I A M TALKING ABOUT IS DARWIN A S STRANGE INVERSION OF REASONING
DanDennett_2009U@20.45:29.83 NOW THAT TITLE THAT PHRASE COMES FROM A CRITIC AN EARLY CRITIC AND THIS IS A PASSAGE THAT I JUST LOVE AND WOULD LIKE TO READ FOR YOU
DanDennett_2009U@30.19:44.42 IN THE THEORY WITH WHICH WE HAVE TO DEAL ABSOLUTE IGNORANCE IS THE ARTIFICER SO THAT WE MAY ENUNCIATE AS THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE A PERFECT AND BEAUTIFUL MACHINE IT IS NOT REQUISITE TO KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT
DanDennett_2009U@45.40:53.64 THIS PROPOSITION WILL BE FOUND ON CAREFUL EXAMINATION TO EXPRESS IN CONDENSED FORM THE ESSENTIAL PURPORT OF THE THEORY
DanDennett_2009U@54.15:61.58 TO EXPRESS IN A FEW WORDS ALL MISTER DARWIN A S MEANING WHO BY A STRANGE INVERSION OF REASONING
DanDennett_2009U@62.08:71.59 SEEMS TO THINK ABSOLUTE IGNORANCE FULLY QUALIFIED TO TAKE THE PLACE OF ABSOLUTE WISDOM IN THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF CREATIVE SKILL EXACTLY
DanDennett_2009U@73.54:76.77 EXACTLY AND IT IS A STRANGE INVERSION
DanDennett_2009U@77.81:79.06 A CREATIONIST
DanDennett_2009U@82.43:89.63 TEST TWO DO YOU KNOW OF ANY BUILDING THAT DIDN A T HAVE A BUILDER YES NO DO YOU KNOW OF ANY PAINTING THAT DIDN A T HAVE A PAINTER
DanDennett_2009U@90.10:98.86 YES NO DO YOU KNOW OF ANY CAR THAT DIDN A T HAVE A MAKER YES NO IF YOU ANSWERED YES FOR ANY OF THE ABOVE GIVE DETAILS
DanDennett_2009U@100.90:105.21 I MEAN IT REALLY IS A STRANGE INVERSION OF REASONING
DanDennett_2009U@105.82:111.82 YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT STANDS TO REASON THAT DESIGN REQUIRES AN INTELLIGENT DESIGNER
DanDennett_2009U@113.62:123.00 BUT DARWIN SHOWS THAT IT A S JUST FALSE TODAY THOUGH I A M GOING TO TALK ABOUT DARWIN A S OTHER STRANGE INVERSION WHICH IS EQUALLY PUZZLING AT FIRST
DanDennett_2009U@126.24:132.20 IT STANDS TO REASON THAT WE LOVE CHOCOLATE CAKE BECAUSE IT IS SWEET
DanDennett_2009U@133.76:137.63 GUYS GO FOR GIRLS LIKE THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE SEXY
DanDennett_2009U@139.42:142.15 WE ADORE BABIES BECAUSE THEY A RE SO CUTE
DanDennett_2009U@143.70:147.84 AND OF COURSE WE ARE AMUSED BY JOKES BECAUSE THEY ARE
DanDennett_2009U@152.90:154.04 THIS IS ALL BACKWARDS
DanDennett_2009U@157.62:163.19 DARWIN SHOWS US WHY LET A S START WITH SWEET OUR SWEET TOOTH
DanDennett_2009U@163.90:172.95 IS BASICALLY AN EVOLVED SUGAR DETECTOR BECAUSE SUGAR IS HIGH ENERGY AND IT A S JUST BEEN WIRED UP TO THE PREFERER TO PUT IT VERY CRUDELY
DanDennett_2009U@173.54:178.93 AND THAT A S WHY WE LIKE SUGAR HONEY IS SWEET BECAUSE WE LIKE IT NOT
DanDennett_2009U@180.07:181.29 WE LIKE IT BECAUSE
DanDennett_2009U@187.37:188.38 ABOUT HONEY IF YOU
DanDennett_2009U@189.24:194.50 GLUCOSE MOLECULES TILL YOU WERE BLIND YOU WOULDN A T SEE WHY THEY TASTED SWEET
DanDennett_2009U@195.51:198.60 YOU HAVE TO LOOK IN OUR BRAINS TO UNDERSTAND WHY
DanDennett_2009U@208.76:212.27 THE OTHER WAY ROUND SWEETNESS WAS BORN WITH THE WIRING
DanDennett_2009U@212.89:219.42 WHICH EVOLVED AND THERE A S NOTHING INTRINSICALLY SEXY ABOUT THESE YOUNG LADIES AND IT A S A GOOD THING
DanDennett_2009U@220.01:224.44 THAT THERE ISN A T BECAUSE OF THERE WERE THEN MOTHER NATURE WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM
DanDennett_2009U@225.82:227.77 HOW ON EARTH DO YOU GET CHIMPS TO
DanDennett_2009U@242.24:245.19 THAT WOULD BE ONE WAY OF DOING IT BUT THERE A S A QUICKER WAY
DanDennett_2009U@246.38:249.10 THE CHIMPS UP TO LOVE THAT LOOK
DanDennett_2009U@250.30:251.36 AND APPARENTLY THEY DO
DanDennett_2009U@256.60:263.89 OVER SIX MILLION YEARS WE AND THE CHIMPS EVOLVED OUR DIFFERENT WAYS WE BECAME BALD BODIED
DanDennett_2009U@264.36:272.28 ODDLY ENOUGH FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER THEY DIDN A T IF WE HADN A T THEN PROBABLY THIS WOULD BE THE HEIGHT OF SEXINESS
DanDennett_2009U@279.48:280.86 OUR SWEET TOOTH
DanDennett_2009U@281.21:290.64 IS AN EVOLVED AND INSTINCTUAL PREFERENCE FOR HIGH ENERGY FOOD IT WASN A T DESIGNED FOR CHOCOLATE CAKE CHOCOLATE CAKE IS A SUPERNORMAL STIMULUS
DanDennett_2009U@290.86:302.27 THE TERM IS OWED TO NIKO TINBERGEN WHO DID HIS FAMOUS EXPERIMENTS WITH GULLS WHERE HE FOUND THAT THAT ORANGE SPOT ON THE GULL A S BEAK IF HE MADE A BIGGER ORANGER SPOT THE GULL CHICKS WOULD PECK AT IT EVEN HARDER
DanDennett_2009U@313.73:322.36 WIRING AND THERE ARE LOTS OF SUPERNORMAL STIMULI CHOCOLATE CAKE IS ONE THERE'S LOTS OF SUPERNORMAL STIMULI FOR SEXINESS AND THERE'S EVEN SUPERNORMAL
DanDennett_2009U@323.12:331.14 FOR CUTENESS HERE A S A PRETTY GOOD EXAMPLE IT A S IMPORTANT THAT WE LOVE BABIES AND THAT WE NOT BE PUT OFF BY SAY MESSY DIAPERS
DanDennett_2009U@331.99:344.36 SO BABIES HAVE TO ATTRACT OUR AFFECTION AND OUR NURTURING AND THEY DO AND BY THE WAY A RECENT STUDY SHOWS THAT MOTHERS PREFER THE SMELL OF THE DIRTY DIAPERS OF THEIR OWN BABY
DanDennett_2009U@345.49:352.34 SO NATURE WORKS ON MANY LEVELS HERE BUT NOW IF BABIES DIDN A T LOOK THE WAY THEY DO IF BABIES LOOKED LIKE THIS
DanDennett_2009U@353.27:360.59 WHAT WE WOULD FIND ADORABLE THAT A S WHAT WE WOULD FIND WE WOULD THINK OH MY GOODNESS DO I EVER WANT TO HUG THAT
DanDennett_2009U@362.08:363.88 THIS IS THE STRANGE INVERSION
DanDennett_2009U@364.35:366.04 WELL NOW FINALLY WHAT ABOUT
DanDennett_2009U@367.88:377.58 MY ANSWER IS IT A S THE SAME STORY THE SAME STORY THIS IS THE HARD ONE THE ONE THAT ISN A T OBVIOUS THAT A S WHY I LEAVE IT TO THE END AND I WON A T BE ABLE TO SAY TOO MUCH ABOUT IT
DanDennett_2009U@378.07:385.61 BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK EVOLUTIONARILY YOU HAVE TO THINK WHAT HARD JOB THAT HAS TO BE DONE IT A S DIRTY WORK SOMEBODY A S GOT TO DO IT
DanDennett_2009U@386.45:387.79 IS SO IMPORTANT
DanDennett_2009U@388.10:392.93 TO GIVE US SUCH A POWERFUL INBUILT REWARD FOR IT WHEN WE SUCCEED
DanDennett_2009U@394.11:401.60 NOW I THINK WE'VE FOUND THE ANSWER I AND A FEW OF MY COLLEAGUES IT A S A NEURAL SYSTEM THAT A S WIRED UP
DanDennett_2009U@401.82:410.35 TO REWARD THE BRAIN FOR DOING A GRUBBY CLERICAL JOB OUR BUMPER STICKER FOR THIS
DanDennett_2009U@427.20:436.29 AS A SORT OF NEUROSCIENTIFIC PROBE BY SWITCHING HUMOR ON AND OFF BY TURNING THE KNOB ON A JOKE NOW IT A S NOT FUNNY OH NOW IT A S FUNNIER
DanDennett_2009U@443.67:458.05 THE FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE BRAIN MATTHEW HURLEY IS THE FIRST AUTHOR OF THIS WE CALL IT THE HURLEY MODEL HE A S A COMPUTER SCIENTIST REGINALD ADAMS A PSYCHOLOGIST AND THERE I AM AND WE A RE PUTTING THIS TOGETHER INTO A BOOK THANK YOU VERY MUCH
