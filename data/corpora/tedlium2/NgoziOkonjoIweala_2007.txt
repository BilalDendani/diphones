NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 MUCH CHRIS EVERYBODY WHO CAME UP HERE SAID THEY WERE SCARED I DON'T KNOW IF I'M SCARED BUT THIS IS MY FIRST TIME OF
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 ADDRESSING AN AUDIENCE LIKE THIS AND I DON'T HAVE ANY SMART TECHNOLOGY FOR YOU TO LOOK AT THERE ARE NO SLIDES SO YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO BE CONTENT WITH ME
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WHAT I WANT TO DO THIS MORNING IS SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE OF STORIES AND TALK ABOUT A DIFFERENT AFRICA
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THE AFRICA OF MALARIA THE AFRICA OF POVERTY THE AFRICA OF CONFLICT AND THE AFRICA OF DISASTERS
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT THOSE THINGS ARE GOING ON THERE'S AN AFRICA THAT YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT VERY MUCH AND SOMETIMES I'M PUZZLED AND I ASK MYSELF WHY
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THIS IS THE AFRICA THAT IS CHANGING THAT CHRIS ALLUDED TO THIS IS THE AFRICA OF OPPORTUNITY THIS IS THE AFRICA WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEIR OWN FUTURES AND THEIR OWN DESTINIES
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND THIS IS THE AFRICA WHERE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR PARTNERSHIPS TO DO THIS THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY AND I WANT TO START BY TELLING YOU A STORY ABOUT THAT CHANGE IN AFRICA
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 ON FIFTEENTH OF SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE MISTER DIEPREYE ALAMIEYESEIGHA A GOVERNOR OF ONE OF THE OIL RICH STATES OF NIGERIA
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WAS ARRESTED BY THE LONDON METROPOLITAN POLICE ON A VISIT TO LONDON
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 HE WAS ARRESTED BECAUSE THERE WERE TRANSFERS OF EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THAT WENT INTO SOME DORMANT ACCOUNTS THAT BELONGED TO HIM AND HIS FAMILY
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THIS ARREST OCCURRED BECAUSE THERE WAS COOPERATION BETWEEN THE LONDON METROPOLITAN POLICE AND THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CRIMES COMMISSION OF NIGERIA LED BY ONE OF OUR MOST ABLE AND COURAGEOUS PEOPLE
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WAS ARRAIGNED IN LONDON DUE TO SOME SLIP UPS HE MANAGED TO ESCAPE DRESSED AS A WOMAN
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND RAN FROM LONDON BACK TO NIGERIA WHERE ACCORDING TO OUR CONSTITUTION THOSE IN OFFICE AS GOVERNORS PRESIDENT AS IN MANY COUNTRIES HAVE IMMUNITY AND CANNOT BE PROSECUTED
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 BUT WHAT HAPPENED PEOPLE WERE SO OUTRAGED BY THIS BEHAVIOR THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HIS STATE LEGISLATURE TO IMPEACH HIM
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND GET HIM OUT OF OFFICE TODAY ALAMS AS WE CALL HIM FOR SHORT IS IN JAIL
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THIS IS A STORY ABOUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE IN AFRICA ARE NO LONGER WILLING TO TOLERATE CORRUPTION FROM
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THIS IS A STORY ABOUT THE
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THAT PEOPLE WANT THEIR RESOURCES MANAGED PROPERLY FOR THEIR GOOD AND NOT TAKEN OUT TO PLACES WHERE THEY'LL BENEFIT JUST A FEW OF THE ELITE
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND THEREFORE WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THE CORRUPT AFRICA
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THAT THE PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNMENTS ARE TRYING HARD TO FIGHT THIS IN SOME OF THE COUNTRIES AND THAT SOME SUCCESSES ARE EMERGING DOES IT MEAN THE PROBLEM IS OVER THE ANSWER IS NO THERE'S STILL A LONG WAY TO GO BUT THAT THERE'S A WILL THERE
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND THAT SUCCESSES ARE BEING CHALKED UP ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT FIGHT SO WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT CORRUPTION DON'T JUST FEEL
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THAT NOTHING IS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS THAT YOU CAN'T OPERATE IN ANY AFRICAN COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE OVERWHELMING CORRUPTION THAT IS NOT THE CASE THERE'S A WILL TO FIGHT
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 IS ONGOING AND IS BEING
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 OTHERS LIKE MINE WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A LONG HISTORY OF DICTATORSHIP IN NIGERIA THE FIGHT IS ONGOING AND WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT THIS IS GOING ON
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THE RESULTS ARE SHOWING INDEPENDENT MONITORING BY THE WORLD BANK AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SHOW THAT IN MANY INSTANCES THE TREND IS DOWNWARDS
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 IN TERMS OF CORRUPTION AND GOVERNANCE IS IMPROVING A STUDY BY THE ECONOMIC COMMISSION FOR AFRICA SHOWED
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 A CLEAR TREND UPWARDS IN GOVERNANCE IN TWENTY EIGHT AFRICAN COUNTRIES AND LET ME SAY JUST ONE MORE THING BEFORE I LEAVE THIS AREA OF GOVERNANCE
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THAT IS THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT CORRUPTION CORRUPTION ALL THE TIME WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT IT YOU IMMEDIATELY THINK ABOUT AFRICA THAT'S THE IMAGE AFRICAN COUNTRIES BUT LET ME SAY THIS
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 IF ALAMS WAS ABLE TO EXPORT EIGHT MILLION
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 DOLLARS INTO AN ACCOUNT IN LONDON
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 IF THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAD TAKEN MONEY ESTIMATED THAT TWENTY TO FORTY BILLION NOW OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES MONIES SITTING ABROAD IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IF THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THIS WHAT IS THAT IS THAT NOT CORRUPTION
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 IN THIS COUNTRY IF YOU RECEIVE STOLEN GOODS ARE YOU NOT PROSECUTED
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS KIND OF CORRUPTION LET US ALSO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLOBE WHERE THE MONEY 'S GOING AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO STOP IT
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AN INITIATIVE NOW ALONG WITH THE WORLD BANK ON ASSET RECOVERY TRYING TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO GET THE MONIES THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN ABROAD
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THE SECOND THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE WILL FOR REFORM
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THE SUBJECT OF EVERYBODY 'S CHARITY AND CARE WE ARE GRATEFUL
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 BUT WE KNOW THAT WE
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 TAKE CHARGE OF OUR OWN DESTINIES IF WE HAVE THE WILL TO REFORM AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN MANY AFRICAN COUNTRIES NOW IS A REALIZATION THAT NO ONE CAN DO IT BUT
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WE HAVE TO DO IT WE CAN INVITE PARTNERS WHO CAN SUPPORT US BUT WE HAVE TO START WE HAVE TO REFORM OUR ECONOMIES CHANGE OUR LEADERSHIP BECOME MORE DEMOCRATIC BE MORE OPEN
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 TO CHANGE AND TO INFORMATION AND THIS IS WHAT WE STARTED TO DO IN ONE OF THE LARGEST COUNTRIES ON THE CONTINENT NIGERIA IN FACT IF YOU'RE NOT IN NIGERIA YOU'RE NOT IN AFRICA I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT ONE IN FOUR SUB SAHARAN AFRICANS IS NIGERIAN
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND IT HAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DYNAMIC PEOPLE CHAOTIC PEOPLE BUT VERY INTERESTING PEOPLE YOU'LL NEVER BE BORED
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WHAT WE STARTED TO DO WAS TO REALIZE THAT WE HAD TO TAKE CHARGE AND REFORM OURSELVES AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF A LEADER WHO WAS WILLING AT THE TIME TO DO THE REFORMS
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WE PUT FORWARD A COMPREHENSIVE REFORM PROGRAM WHICH WE DEVELOPED OURSELVES NOT THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND NOT THE WORLD BANK WHERE I WORKED FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS AND ROSE TO BE A VICE PRESIDENT
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 NO ONE CAN DO IT FOR YOU YOU HAVE TO DO IT FOR YOURSELF WE PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAM THAT WOULD ONE GET THE STATE OUT OF BUSINESSES IT HAD NOTHING
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 IT HAD NO BUSINESS BEING IN THE STATE SHOULD NOT BE IN THE BUSINESS OF PRODUCING GOODS AND SERVICES BECAUSE IT'S INEFFICIENT AND INCOMPETENT SO WE DECIDED TO PRIVATIZE MANY
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WE AS A RESULT WE DECIDED TO LIBERALIZE MANY OF OUR MARKETS CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT PRIOR TO THIS REFORM WHICH STARTED AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND AND THREE WHEN I LEFT WASHINGTON TO GO AND TAKE UP THE POST OF FINANCE MINISTER
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WE HAD A TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY THAT WAS ONLY ABLE TO DEVELOP FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED LANDLINES IN ITS ENTIRE THIRTY YEAR HISTORY
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 HAVING A TELEPHONE IN MY COUNTRY WAS A HUGE LUXURY YOU COULDN'T GET IT YOU HAD TO BRIBE YOU HAD TO DO EVERYTHING TO GET
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WHEN PRESIDENT OBASANJO SUPPORTED AND LAUNCHED THE LIBERALIZATION OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WE WENT FROM FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED LANDLINES
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 TO THIRTY TWO MILLION GSM LINES AND COUNTING NIGERIA
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WE ARE GETTING INVESTMENTS OF ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN TELECOMS AND NOBODY KNOWS
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 IN A MARKET IN A COUNTRY THAT IS A POOR COUNTRY WITH AN AVERAGE PER CAPITA INCOME JUST UNDER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 SO THE MARKET IS THERE
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WHEN THEY KEPT THIS UNDER WRAPS BUT SOON OTHERS GOT TO KNOW
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 SO PRIVATIZATION IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE DONE
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THE OTHER THING WE'VE ALSO DONE
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 IS TO MANAGE OUR FINANCES BETTER
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 BECAUSE NOBODY 'S GOING TO HELP YOU AND SUPPORT YOU
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 BEING CORRUPT AND NOT MANAGING ITS OWN PUBLIC FINANCES WELL SO WHAT DID WE TRY TO DO WE INTRODUCED A FISCAL RULE
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THAT DE LINKED OUR BUDGET FROM THE OIL PRICE BEFORE WE USED TO JUST BUDGET ON WHATEVER OIL WE BRING IN BECAUSE OIL IS THE
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 BIGGEST MOST REVENUE EARNING SECTOR IN THE ECONOMY SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR REVENUES COME FROM OIL WE DE LINKED THAT
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND ONCE WE DID IT WE BEGAN TO BUDGET AT A PRICE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE OIL PRICE AND SAVE WHATEVER WAS ABOVE THAT PRICE
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WE DIDN'T KNOW WE COULD PULL IT OFF IT WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL BUT WHAT IT IMMEDIATELY DID WAS THAT THE VOLATILITY THAT HAD BEEN PRESENT IN TERMS OF OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHERE
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 IF OIL PRICES WERE HIGH WE WOULD GROW VERY FAST WHEN THEY CRASHED WE CRASHED AND WE COULD HARDLY EVEN PAY ANYTHING ANY SALARIES IN THE ECONOMY
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THAT SMOOTHENED OUT WE WERE ABLE TO SAVE JUST BEFORE I LEFT TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WHEREAS AND THIS WENT TO OUR RESERVES
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 PROPER MANAGEMENT OF OUR FINANCES AND THAT SHORES UP OUR ECONOMY MAKES IT STABLE OUR EXCHANGE RATE THAT USED TO FLUCTUATE ALL THE TIME IS NOW FAIRLY STABLE AND BEING MANAGED SO THAT BUSINESS PEOPLE HAVE A PREDICTABILITY
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 PRICES IN THE ECONOMY
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WE BROUGHT INFLATION DOWN FROM TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT TO ABOUT ELEVEN PERCENT
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND WE HAD GDP GROW
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 FROM AN AVERAGE OF TWO POINT THREE PERCENT THE PREVIOUS DECADE TO ABOUT SIX POINT FIVE PERCENT
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 SO ALL THE CHANGES AND REFORMS WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE HAVE SHOWN UP IN RESULTS THAT ARE MEASURABLE IN THE ECONOMY
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET AWAY FROM OIL AND DIVERSIFY AND THERE ARE SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS ONE BIG COUNTRY AS IN MANY COUNTRIES IN AFRICA
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WHAT WAS REMARKABLE IS THAT MUCH OF THIS GROWTH CAME NOT FROM THE OIL SECTOR ALONE BUT FROM NON OIL
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND I COULD GO ON AND ON AND THIS IS TO ILLUSTRATE TO YOU THAT ONCE YOU GET THE MACRO ECONOMY STRAIGHTENED OUT THE OPPORTUNITIES IN VARIOUS
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES IN AGRICULTURE LIKE I SAID WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES IN SOLID MINERALS WE HAVE A LOT OF MINERALS THAT NO ONE HAS EVEN INVESTED IN OR EXPLORED
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND WE REALIZED THAT WITHOUT THE PROPER LEGISLATION TO MAKE THAT POSSIBLE THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN SO WE'VE NOW GOT A MINING CODE THAT IS COMPARABLE WITH SOME OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THIS WAS AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE THAT EXCITED THE IMAGINATION OF PEOPLE
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND NOW WE HAVE A SITUATION IN WHICH THE BUSINESSES IN THIS MALL ARE DOING FOUR TIMES THE TURNOVER THAT THEY HAD PROJECTED SO HUGE THINGS IN CONSTRUCTION REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE MARKETS FINANCIAL SERVICES WE HAD EIGHTY NINE BANKS
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 TOO MANY NOT DOING THEIR REAL BUSINESS WE CONSOLIDATED THEM FROM EIGHTY NINE TO TWENTY FIVE BANKS BY REQUIRING THAT THEY INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL SHARE CAPITAL
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND THAT STRENGTHENING OF THE BANKING SYSTEM HAS ATTRACTED A LOT OF INVESTMENT FROM OUTSIDE BARCLAYS BANK OF THE U K IS BRINGING IN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 HAS BROUGHT IN ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION AND I CAN GO ON DOLLARS ON AND ON INTO THE SYSTEM WE ARE DOING THE SAME WITH THE INSURANCE SECTOR SO IN FINANCIAL SERVICES A GREAT DEAL OF OPPORTUNITY IN TOURISM
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 IN MANY AFRICAN COUNTRIES
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 A GREAT OPPORTUNITY AND THAT'S WHAT MANY PEOPLE KNOW EAST AFRICA
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THE WILDLIFE THE ELEPHANTS AND SO ON BUT MANAGING THE TOURISM MARKET IN A WAY THAT CAN REALLY BENEFIT THE PEOPLE IS VERY IMPORTANT
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 SO WHAT AM I TRYING TO SAY I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT THERE'S A NEW WAVE ON THE CONTINENT
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 A NEW WAVE OF OPENNESS AND DEMOCRATIZATION IN WHICH SINCE TWO THOUSAND MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF AFRICAN COUNTRIES HAVE HAD MULTI PARTY DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN PERFECT OR WILL BE BUT THE TREND IS VERY CLEAR
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT SINCE THE PAST THREE YEARS THE AVERAGE RATE OF GROWTH ON THE CONTINENT HAS MOVED FROM ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT TO ABOUT FIVE PERCENT PER ANNUM THIS IS BETTER THAN THE PERFORMANCE OF MANY OECD COUNTRIES
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THAT THINGS ARE CHANGING
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD EFFECT WHERE IF SOMETHING IS GOING ON IN ONE PART OF THE CONTINENT IT LOOKS LIKE THE ENTIRE CONTINENT IS AFFECTED BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THIS CONTINENT IS NOT IS A CONTINENT OF MANY COUNTRIES
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 NOT ONE COUNTRY
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND IF WE ARE DOWN TO THREE OR FOUR CONFLICTS IT MEANS THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES TO INVEST IN STABLE
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 GROWING EXCITING ECONOMIES
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND I WANT TO JUST MAKE ONE POINT ABOUT
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THIS INVESTMENT THE BEST WAY TO HELP AFRICANS
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 IS TO HELP THEM TO STAND ON THEIR OWN FEET
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 IS BY HELPING CREATE JOBS
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 NO ISSUE WITH FIGHTING MALARIA AND PUTTING MONEY IN THAT AND SAVING CHILDREN 'S LIVES THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING THAT
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 BUT IMAGINE THE IMPACT ON A FAMILY IF THE PARENTS CAN BE EMPLOYED AND MAKE SURE THEIR CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL THAT THEY CAN BUY THE DRUGS TO FIGHT THE DISEASE THEMSELVES
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 IF WE CAN INVEST IN PLACES WHERE YOU YOURSELVES MAKE MONEY WHILST CREATING JOBS AND HELPING PEOPLE STAND ON THEIR OWN FEET
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 ISN'T THAT A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY ISN'T THAT THE WAY TO GO AND I WANT TO SAY THAT SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE TO INVEST IN ON THE CONTINENT ARE THE WOMEN
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 CD HERE I'M SORRY THAT I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ON TIME OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE LIKED YOU TO HAVE SEEN THIS IT SAYS AFRICA OPEN FOR BUSINESS
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND THIS IS A VIDEO THAT HAS ACTUALLY WON AN AWARD AS THE BEST DOCUMENTARY OF THE YEAR UNDERSTAND THAT THE WOMAN WHO MADE IT IS GOING TO BE IN TANZANIA WHERE THEY'RE HAVING THE SESSION IN JUNE
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 BUT IT SHOWS YOU AFRICANS AND PARTICULARLY AFRICAN WOMEN WHO AGAINST ALL ODDS HAVE DEVELOPED BUSINESSES SOME OF THEM WORLD CLASS
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 ONE OF THE WOMEN IN THIS VIDEO ADENIKE OGUNLESI MAKING CHILDREN 'S CLOTHES WHICH SHE STARTED AS A HOBBY
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND GREW INTO A BUSINESS MIXING AFRICAN MATERIALS SUCH AS WE HAVE
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WITH MATERIALS FROM ELSEWHERE SO SHE'LL MAKE A LITTLE PAIR OF DUNGAREES WITH CORDUROYS WITH AFRICAN MATERIAL MIXED IN
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 VERY CREATIVE DESIGNS
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 HAS REACHED A STAGE WHERE SHE EVEN HAD AN ORDER FROM
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 FOR TEN THOUSAND PIECES
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 SO THAT SHOWS YOU THAT
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE CAPABLE OF DOING AND THE WOMEN ARE DILIGENT THEY ARE FOCUSED THEY WORK HARD I COULD GO ON GIVING EXAMPLES BEATRICE GAKUBA OF RWANDA WHO OPENED UP A FLOWER BUSINESS
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 AND IS NOW EXPORTING TO THE DUTCH AUCTION IN AMSTERDAM EACH MORNING AND IS EMPLOYING TWO HUNDRED OTHER WOMEN AND MEN TO WORK WITH
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 HOWEVER MANY OF THESE ARE STARVED FOR CAPITAL TO
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 BECAUSE NOBODY BELIEVES OUTSIDE OF OUR COUNTRIES THAT WE CAN DO
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WHAT IS NECESSARY NOBODY THINKS IN TERMS OF A MARKET NOBODY THINKS THERE'S OPPORTUNITY BUT I'M STANDING HERE SAYING THAT THOSE WHO MISS THE BOAT NOW
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WILL MISS IT FOREVER SO IF YOU WANT TO BE IN AFRICA THINK ABOUT INVESTING
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THINK ABOUT THE BEATRICES THINK ABOUT
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 OF THIS WORLD WHO ARE DOING INCREDIBLE THINGS
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 THAT ARE BRINGING THEM INTO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WHILST AT THE SAME TIME MAKING SURE THAT THEIR FELLOW MEN AND WOMEN ARE EMPLOYED AND THAT THE CHILDREN IN THOSE HOUSEHOLDS GET EDUCATED BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS ARE EARNING ADEQUATE INCOME SO I INVITE YOU
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 WHEN YOU GO TO TANZANIA LISTEN CAREFULLY
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU WILL HEAR
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 OF THE VARIOUS OPENINGS THAT THERE WILL BE FOR YOU TO GET INVOLVED
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 IN SOMETHING THAT WILL DO GOOD
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007 FOR YOURSELVES THANK YOU VERY MUCH
