OryOkolloh_2007G@435.10:444.98 AND I JUST WANTED TO PERSONALIZE THAT BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT IT IN BIG TERMS AND YOU WONDER YOU KNOW SO WHAT BUT IT'S DAMAGING
OryOkolloh_2007G@446.11:455.42 I'M NOT UNIQUE RIGHT IMAGINE IF ALL YOU KNEW ABOUT WILLIAM WAS THE FACT THAT HE GREW UP IN A POOR VILLAGE AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE WINDMILL YOU KNOW

OryOkolloh_2007G@619.18:628.27 BUT I WALKED AWAY FROM THAT BECAUSE MY PASSION WAS HERE AND BECAUSE I WANTED TO DO THINGS THAT WERE FULFILLLING AND BECAUSE I'M NEEDED HERE YOU KNOW
OryOkolloh_2007G@643.11:654.39 I'M A CORPORATE LAWYER MOST OF THE TIME FOR AN ORGANIZATION CALLED ENABLIS THAT SUPPORTS ENTREPRENEURS IN SOUTH AFRICA WE'RE NOW MOVING INTO EAST AFRICA AND WE GIVE THEM BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

OryOkolloh_2007G@683.85:691.70 WHERE PEOPLE CAN ASK THEIR MPS QUESTIONS THERE ARE SOME MPS WHO PARTICIPATE AND COME BACK AND ASK AND BASICALLY WE STARTED THIS BECAUSE WE WERE TIRED OF COMPLAINING
OryOkolloh_2007G@692.18:699.34 ABOUT OUR POLITICIANS YOU KNOW I BELIEVE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY STEMS FROM DEMAND YOU'RE NOT JUST GOING TO BE ACCOUNTABLE OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF YOUR HEART
OryOkolloh_2007G@699.69:706.87 AND WE AS AFRICANS NEED TO START CHALLENGING OUR LEADERS WHAT ARE THEY DOING YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE JUST
OryOkolloh_2007G@707.32:719.77 OUT OF NOWHERE SO WE NEED NEW POLICIES WE NEED WHERE'S THAT COMING FROM YOU KNOW ANOTHER THING IS THAT THESE LEADERS ARE A REFLECTION OF OUR SOCIETY WE TALK ABOUT AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS LIKE THEY'VE BEEN DROPPED FROM MARS
OryOkolloh_2007G@720.17:729.09 YOU KNOW THEY COME FROM US AND WHAT IS IT ABOUT OUR SOCIETY THAT IS GENERATING LEADERS THAT WE DON'T LIKE AND HOW CAN WE CHANGE THAT

OryOkolloh_2007G@754.04:762.57 OTHER THING I WANT TO URGE YOU TO DO IS TAKE AN INTEREST IN THE INDIVIDUAL I'VE HAD LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THINGS I THINK

OryOkolloh_2007G@775.09:782.96 NOT THAT EASY YOU KNOW AND SOMETIMES JUST TAKING AN INTEREST IN THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE FELLOWS YOU'VE MET AND THE BUSINESSPEOPLE YOU'VE MET
OryOkolloh_2007G@783.39:790.29 IT CAN MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE ESPECIALLY IN AFRICA BECAUSE USUALLY THE INDIVIDUAL IN AFRICA CARRIES A LOT OF PEOPLE BEHIND THEM
OryOkolloh_2007G@802.52:811.07 MY COUSIN RAN OUT OF SCHOOL FEES AND SHE'S REALLY SMART I WAS PAYING HER SCHOOL FEES A COUSIN OF MINE DIED OF AIDS LEFT AN ORPHAN SO WE SAID WELL WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH HER

OryOkolloh_2007G@953.24:965.22 GROW UP YOU KNOW NOT SO GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES AND YOU CAN MOVE JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE BORN IN RURAL ARKANSAS WHATEVER THAT DOESN'T DEFINE WHO YOU ARE FOR MOST AFRICANS
OryOkolloh_2007G@966.91:974.57 WHERE YOU LIVE OR WHERE YOU WERE BORN AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH YOU WERE BORN DETERMINE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
OryOkolloh_2007G@974.74:983.31 I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT CHANGE AND THE CHANGE STARTS WITH US AND AS AFRICANS WE NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR CONTINENT THANK YOU
