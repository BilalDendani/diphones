PattieMaes_2009 BEEN INTRIGUED BY THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER WE COULD EVOLVE OR DEVELOP A SIXTH SENSE A SENSE THAT WOULD GIVE US SEAMLESS ACCESS AND EASY ACCESS
PattieMaes_2009 TO META INFORMATION OR INFORMATION THAT MAY EXIST SOMEWHERE THAT MAY BE RELEVANT TO HELP US MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION ABOUT WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE'RE COMING ACROSS
PattieMaes_2009 AND SOME OF YOU MAY ARGUE WELL DON'T TODAY 'S CELL PHONES DO THAT ALREADY BUT I WOULD SAY NO WHEN YOU MEET SOMEONE HERE AT TED AND THIS IS
PattieMaes_2009 THE TOP NETWORKING PLACE OF COURSE OF THE YEAR YOU DON'T SHAKE SOMEBODY 'S HAND AND THEN SAY CAN YOU HOLD ON FOR A MOMENT WHILE I TAKE OUT MY PHONE AND GOOGLE YOU OR
PattieMaes_2009 WHEN YOU GO TO THE SUPERMARKET AND YOU'RE STANDING THERE IN THAT HUGE AISLE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF TOILET PAPERS YOU DON'T TAKE OUT YOUR CELL PHONE AND OPEN A BROWSER AND GO TO A WEBSITE
PattieMaes_2009 SO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE EASY ACCESS TO ALL THIS RELEVANT INFORMATION THAT CAN JUST HELP US MAKE
PattieMaes_2009 SORT OF EASY WAY WITHOUT REQUIRING THAT THE USER CHANGES ANY OF THEIR BEHAVIOR AND I'M HERE TO UNVEIL
PattieMaes_2009 OUR LATEST EFFORT AND MOST SUCCESSFUL EFFORT SO FAR WHICH IS STILL VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROCESS I'M ACTUALLY WEARING THE DEVICE RIGHT NOW AND
PattieMaes_2009 SORT OF COBBLED IT TOGETHER WITH COMPONENTS THAT ARE OFF THE SHELF AND BY THE WAY ONLY COST THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS AT THIS POINT IN TIME I'M WEARING A CAMERA JUST A SIMPLE
PattieMaes_2009 A PORTABLE BATTERY POWERED PROJECTION SYSTEM WITH A LITTLE MIRROR THESE COMPONENTS COMMUNICATE TO MY CELL PHONE IN MY POCKET WHICH ACTS AS THE
PattieMaes_2009 AND WE SEE HOW THIS SYSTEM LET 'S HIM WALK UP TO ANY SURFACE AND START USING HIS HANDS TO INTERACT WITH THE INFORMATION THAT IS PROJECTED IN FRONT OF HIM
PattieMaes_2009 THE SYSTEM TRACKS THE FOUR SIGNIFICANT FINGERS IN THIS CASE HE 'S WEARING SIMPLE MARKER CAPS THAT YOU MAY
PattieMaes_2009 BUT IF YOU WANT A MORE STYLISH VERSION YOU COULD ALSO PAINT YOUR NAILS IN DIFFERENT COLORS AND THE CAMERA BASICALLY TRACKS THESE FOUR FINGERS AND RECOGNIZES
PattieMaes_2009 GESTURES THAT HE 'S MAKING SO HE CAN JUST GO TO FOR EXAMPLE A MAP OF LONG BEACH ZOOM IN AND OUT
PattieMaes_2009 THE SYSTEM ALSO RECOGNIZES ICONIC GESTURES SUCH AS THE TAKE A PICTURE GESTURE AND IT TAKES A PICTURE OF WHATEVER IS IN FRONT OF YOU
PattieMaes_2009 AND WHEN HE THEN WALKS BACK TO THE MEDIA LAB HE CAN JUST GO UP TO ANY WALL AND PROJECT ALL THE PICTURES
PattieMaes_2009 SORT THROUGH THEM AND ORGANIZE THEM AND RE SIZE THEM ET CETERA AGAIN USING ALL NATURAL GESTURES SO SOME OF YOU MOST LIKELY WERE HERE TWO YEARS AGO AND SAW THE DEMO BY
PattieMaes_2009 JEFF HAN OR SOME OF YOU MAY THINK WELL DOESN'T THIS LOOK LIKE THE MICROSOFT SURFACE TABLE AND YES YOU ALSO INTERACT USING NATURAL GESTURES BOTH HANDS ET CETERA
PattieMaes_2009 BUT THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT YOU CAN USE ANY SURFACE YOU CAN WALK TO UP TO ANY SURFACE INCLUDING YOUR HAND IF NOTHING ELSE IS AVAILABLE
PattieMaes_2009 AND INTERACT WITH THIS PROJECTED DATA THE DEVICE IS COMPLETELY PORTABLE AND CAN BE
PattieMaes_2009 SO ONE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IS THAT IT'S TOTALLY MOBILE ANOTHER EVEN MORE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IS THAT IN MASS PRODUCTION THIS WOULD NOT COST MORE TOMORROW THAN TODAY 'S CELL PHONES AND WOULD ACTUALLY NOT
PattieMaes_2009 SORT OF BE A BIGGER PACKAGING COULD LOOK A LOT MORE STYLISH THAN THIS VERSION THAT I'M WEARING AROUND MY NECK
PattieMaes_2009 BUT OTHER THAN LETTING SOME OF YOU LIVE OUT YOUR FANTASY OF LOOKING AS COOL AS TOM CRUISE IN MINORITY REPORT
PattieMaes_2009 THE REASON WHY WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS DEVICE IS THAT IT REALLY CAN ACT AS ONE OF THESE SIXTH SENSE DEVICES THAT GIVES YOU RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT WHATEVER IS IN FRONT OF YOU
PattieMaes_2009 SO WE SEE PRANAV HERE GOING INTO THE SUPERMARKET AND HE 'S SHOPPING FOR SOME PAPER TOWELS AND AS HE PICKS UP A PRODUCT THE SYSTEM CAN RECOGNIZE THE PRODUCT THAT HE 'S PICKING UP
PattieMaes_2009 USING EITHER IMAGE RECOGNITION OR MARKER TECHNOLOGY AND GIVE HIM THE GREEN LIGHT OR AN ORANGE LIGHT HE CAN ASK FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SO THIS PARTICULAR
PattieMaes_2009 CHOICE HERE IS A PARTICULARLY GOOD CHOICE GIVEN HIS PERSONAL CRITERIA SOME OF YOU MAY WANT THE TOILET PAPER WITH THE MOST BLEACH IN IT RATHER THAN THE MOST ECOLOGICALLY RESPONSIBLE CHOICE
PattieMaes_2009 PICKS UP A BOOK IN THE BOOKSTORE HE CAN GET AN AMAZON RATING IT GETS PROJECTED RIGHT ON THE COVER OF THE BOOK
PattieMaes_2009 IS JUAN 'S BOOK OUR PREVIOUS SPEAKER WHICH GETS A GREAT RATING BY THE WAY AT AMAZON AND SO PRANAV TURNS THE PAGE OF THE BOOK AND CAN THEN SEE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE BOOK
PattieMaes_2009 READER COMMENTS MAYBE SORT OF INFORMATION BY HIS FAVORITE CRITIC ET CETERA IF HE TURNS TO A PARTICULAR PAGE HE FINDS
PattieMaes_2009 BY MAYBE AN EXPERT OF A FRIEND OF OURS THAT GIVES HIM A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHATEVER IS ON THAT PARTICULAR PAGE READING THE NEWSPAPER IT NEVER HAS TO BE OUTDATED
PattieMaes_2009 YOU CAN GET
PattieMaes_2009 MAYBE YOU
PattieMaes_2009 CAN SEE A WORD CLOUD OF THE TAGS THE WORDS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PERSON IN THEIR BLOG AND PERSONAL WEBPAGES IN THIS CASE THE STUDENT IS INTERESTED IN CAMERAS
PattieMaes_2009 ON YOUR WAY TO THE AIRPORT IF YOU PICK UP YOUR BOARDING PASS IT CAN TELL YOU THAT YOUR FLIGHT IS DELAYED THAT THE GATE HAS CHANGED ET CETERA AND IF YOU NEED TO KNOW
PattieMaes_2009 CURRENT TIME IS IT'S AS SIMPLE AS
PattieMaes_2009 SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT SO FAR IN DEVELOPING THIS SIXTH SENSE THAT WOULD GIVE US SEAMLESS ACCESS TO ALL THIS RELEVANT INFORMATION
PattieMaes_2009 ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE MAY COME ACROSS MY STUDENT PRANAV WHO 'S REALLY LIKE I SAID THE GENIUS BEHIND
PattieMaes_2009 LOT OF APPLAUSE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK HE 'S SLEPT MUCH IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS ACTUALLY AND HIS GIRLFRIEND IS PROBABLY NOT VERY HAPPY ABOUT HIM EITHER
PattieMaes_2009 BUT IT'S NOT PERFECT YET IT'S VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS AND WHO KNOWS MAYBE IN ANOTHER TEN YEARS WE'LL BE HERE WITH THE ULTIMATE SIXTH SENSE BRAIN IMPLANT THANK YOU
