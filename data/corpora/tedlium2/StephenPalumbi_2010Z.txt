StephenPalumbi_2010Z A VERY COMPLICATED THING THE OCEAN AND IT CAN BE A VERY COMPLICATED THING WHAT HUMAN HEALTH IS AND BRINGING THOSE TWO TOGETHER MIGHT SEEM A VERY DAUNTING TASK
StephenPalumbi_2010Z BUT WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY TO SAY IS THAT EVEN IN THAT COMPLEXITY THERE'S SOME SIMPLE THEMES THAT I THINK IF WE UNDERSTAND
StephenPalumbi_2010Z MOMMA AIN'T HAPPY AIN'T NOBODY HAPPY WE KNOW THAT RIGHT WE'VE EXPERIENCED THAT
StephenPalumbi_2010Z AND IF WE JUST TAKE THAT AND WE BUILD FROM THERE THEN WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT STEP WHICH IS THAT IF THE OCEAN AIN'T HAPPY
StephenPalumbi_2010Z NOBODY HAPPY THAT'S THE THEME OF MY TALK AND WE'RE MAKING THE OCEAN PRETTY UNHAPPY IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS THIS IS A SHOT
StephenPalumbi_2010Z INTO THE AIR AND INTO THE WATER ROLF BOLIN WHO WAS A PROFESSOR AT THE HOPKIN 'S MARINE STATION WHERE I WORK WROTE IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES THAT THE FUMES FROM THE SCUM FLOATING ON THE INLETS OF THE
StephenPalumbi_2010Z SO BAD THEY TURNED LEAD BASED PAINTS BLACK PEOPLE WORKING IN THESE CANNERIES COULD BARELY STAY THERE ALL DAY BECAUSE OF THE SMELL BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CAME OUT SAYING THEY SAY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SMELL YOU SMELL MONEY
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THAT POLLUTION WAS MONEY TO THAT COMMUNITY AND THOSE PEOPLE DEALT WITH THE POLLUTION AND ABSORBED IT INTO THEIR SKIN AND INTO THEIR BODIES
StephenPalumbi_2010Z BECAUSE THEY NEEDED THE MONEY WE MADE THE OCEAN UNHAPPY WE MADE PEOPLE VERY UNHAPPY AND WE MADE THEM UNHEALTHY
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THE CONNECTION BETWEEN OCEAN HEALTH AND HUMAN HEALTH IS ACTUALLY BASED UPON ANOTHER COUPLE SIMPLE ADAGES AND I WANT TO CALL THAT PINCH A MINNOW HURT A WHALE THE PYRAMID OF OCEAN LIFE NOW WHEN AN ECOLOGIST LOOKS AT THE OCEAN I HAVE TO TELL YOU
StephenPalumbi_2010Z WE LOOK AT THE OCEAN IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY AND WE SEE DIFFERENT THINGS THAN WHEN A REGULAR PERSON LOOKS AT THE OCEAN BECAUSE WHEN AN ECOLOGIST LOOKS AT THE OCEAN WE SEE ALL THOSE INTERCONNECTIONS WE SEE THE BASE OF THE FOOD CHAIN THE PLANKTON THE SMALL THINGS AND WE SEE HOW THOSE
StephenPalumbi_2010Z WHY DOES THAT MATTER FOR HUMAN HEALTH BECAUSE WHEN WE JAM THINGS IN THE BOTTOM OF THAT PYRAMID THAT SHOULDN 'T BE THERE SOME VERY FRIGHTENING THINGS HAPPEN
StephenPalumbi_2010Z AND THEY DRIFT UP THEY'RE PASSED UP THAT WAY ON TO PREDATORS AND ON TO THE TOP PREDATORS AND IN SO DOING THEY ACCUMULATE
StephenPalumbi_2010Z NOW TO BRING THAT HOME I THOUGHT I'D INVENT A LITTLE GAME WE DON'T REALLY HAVE TO PLAY IT WE CAN JUST THINK ABOUT IT HERE IT'S THE STYROFOAM AND CHOCOLATE GAME IMAGINE THAT WHEN WE GOT ON THIS BOAT WE WERE ALL GIVEN TWO STYROFOAM PEANUTS
StephenPalumbi_2010Z WHAT 'LL HAPPEN IS THAT THE STYROFOAM PEANUTS WILL START MOVING THROUGH OUR SOCIETY HERE AND THEY WILL ACCUMULATE IN THE DRUNKEST STINGIEST PEOPLE
StephenPalumbi_2010Z NO MECHANISM IN THIS GAME FOR THEM TO GO ANYWHERE BUT INTO A BIGGER AND BIGGER PILE OF
StephenPalumbi_2010Z AND WE HAD THOSE INSTEAD WELL SOME OF US WOULD BE EATING THOSE CHOCOLATES INSTEAD OF PASSING THEM AROUND AND INSTEAD OF ACCUMULATING THEY WILL JUST PASS INTO OUR GROUP HERE AND NOT
StephenPalumbi_2010Z IN NORTH CAROLINA THEY GET INTO THE FOOD CHAIN THE DOLPHINS EAT THE FISH THAT HAVE PCBS FROM THE PLANKTON AND THOSE PCBS BEING
StephenPalumbi_2010Z FAT SOLUBLE ACCUMULATE IN THESE DOLPHINS NOW A DOLPHIN MOTHER DOLPHIN ANY DOLPHIN THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY THAT A PCB CAN GET OUT OF A DOLPHIN
StephenPalumbi_2010Z AND WHAT'S THAT IN MOTHER 'S MILK HERE 'S A DIAGRAM OF THE PCB LOAD OF DOLPHINS IN SARASOTA BAY ADULT MALES A HUGE LOAD JUVENILES A HUGE LOAD
StephenPalumbi_2010Z FEMALES AFTER THEIR FIRST CALF IS ALREADY WEANED A LOWER LOAD THOSE FEMALES THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO THOSE FEMALES ARE PASSING THE PCBS IN THE FAT OF THEIR OWN MOTHER 'S MILK INTO THEIR OFFSPRING
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THESE MOTHERS PUMP THEIR FIRST OFFSPRING FULL OF THIS POLLUTANT AND MOST OF THEM
StephenPalumbi_2010Z NOW THE MOTHER THEN CAN GO AND REPRODUCE BUT WHAT A TERRIBLE PRICE TO PAY FOR THE ACCUMULATION OF THIS POLLUTANT IN THESE ANIMALS THE DEATH OF THE FIRST BORN CALF
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THERE'S ANOTHER TOP PREDATOR IN THE OCEAN IT TURNS OUT THAT TOP PREDATOR OF COURSE IS US AND WE ALSO ARE EATING MEAT
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THAT COMES FROM SOME OF THESE SAME PLACES THIS IS WHALE MEAT THAT I PHOTOGRAPHED IN A GROCERY STORE IN TOKYO OR IS IT
StephenPalumbi_2010Z IN FACT WHAT WE DID A FEW YEARS AGO WAS LEARN HOW TO SMUGGLE A MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LAB INTO TOKYO AND USE IT TO GENETICALLY TEST THE DNA OUT OF WHALE MEAT SAMPLES
StephenPalumbi_2010Z AND IDENTIFY WHAT THEY REALLY WERE AND SOME OF THOSE WHALE MEAT SAMPLES WERE WHALE MEAT SOME OF THEM WERE ILLEGAL WHALE MEAT BY THE WAY THAT'S ANOTHER STORY
StephenPalumbi_2010Z BUT SOME OF THEM WERE NOT WHALE MEAT AT ALL EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE LABELED WHALE MEAT THEY WERE DOLPHIN MEAT SOME OF THEM WERE DOLPHIN LIVER SOME OF THEM WERE DOLPHIN BLUBBER AND THOSE
StephenPalumbi_2010Z DOLPHIN PARTS HAD A HUGE LOAD OF PCBS DIOXINS AND HEAVY METALS AND THAT HUGE LOAD WAS PASSING INTO THE PEOPLE THAT ATE THIS MEAT
StephenPalumbi_2010Z IT TURNS OUT THAT A LOT OF DOLPHINS ARE BEING SOLD AS MEAT IN THE WHALE MEAT MARKET AROUND THE WORLD THAT'S A TRAGEDY FOR THOSE POPULATIONS BUT IT'S ALSO A TRAGEDY FOR THE PEOPLE EATING THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S TOXIC MEAT
StephenPalumbi_2010Z WE HAD THESE DATA A FEW YEARS AGO I REMEMBER SITTING AT MY DESK BEING ABOUT THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO KNEW THAT
StephenPalumbi_2010Z WHALE MEAT BEING SOLD IN THESE MARKETS WAS REALLY DOLPHIN MEAT AND IT WAS TOXIC IT HAD TWO TO THREE TO FOUR HUNDRED TIMES THE TOXIC LOADS EVER ALLOWED
StephenPalumbi_2010Z BY THE EPA AND I REMEMBER THERE SITTING AT MY DESK THINKING WELL I KNOW THIS THIS IS A GREAT SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY BUT IT WAS SO
StephenPalumbi_2010Z AND FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN MY SCIENTIFIC CAREER I BROKE SCIENTIFIC PROTOCOL WHICH IS THAT YOU TAKE THE DATA AND PUBLISH THEM IN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AND THEN BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT THEM
StephenPalumbi_2010Z WE SENT A VERY POLITE LETTER TO THE MINISTER OF HEALTH IN JAPAN AND SIMPLY POINTED OUT THAT
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THIS IS AN INTOLERABLE SITUATION NOT FOR US BUT FOR THE PEOPLE OF JAPAN BECAUSE MOTHERS WHO MAY BE BREASTFEEDING WHO MAY HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN WOULD BE BUYING SOMETHING THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS HEALTHY BUT IT WAS REALLY TOXIC
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THAT LED TO A WHOLE SERIES OF OTHER CAMPAIGNS IN JAPAN AND I'M REALLY PROUD TO SAY THAT AT THIS POINT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BUY ANYTHING IN JAPAN THAT'S LABELED INCORRECTLY
StephenPalumbi_2010Z EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE STILL SELLING WHALE MEAT WHICH I BELIEVE THEY SHOULDN 'T BUT AT LEAST IT'S LABELED CORRECTLY AND YOU'RE NO LONGER GOING TO BE BUYING TOXIC DOLPHIN MEAT INSTEAD
StephenPalumbi_2010Z IT ISN'T JUST THERE THAT THIS HAPPENS BUT IN A NATURAL DIET OF SOME COMMUNITIES IN THE CANADIAN ARCTIC AND IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN THE EUROPEAN ARCTIC A NATURAL DIET OF SEALS
StephenPalumbi_2010Z AND WHALES LEADS TO AN ACCUMULATION OF PCBS THAT HAVE GATHERED UP FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD AND ENDED UP IN THESE WOMEN THESE WOMEN HAVE TOXIC BREAST MILK
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THEY CANNOT FEED THEIR OFFSPRING THEIR CHILDREN THEIR BREAST MILK BECAUSE OF THE ACCUMULATION OF THESE TOXINS IN THEIR FOOD CHAIN IN THEIR PART OF THE WORLD 'S OCEAN PYRAMID
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THAT MEANS THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS ARE COMPROMISED IT MEANS THAT THEIR CHILDREN 'S DEVELOPMENT CAN BE COMPROMISED AND THE WORLD 'S ATTENTION ON THIS OVER THE LAST DECADE HAS REDUCED THE PROBLEM FOR THESE WOMEN
StephenPalumbi_2010Z NOT BY CHANGING THE PYRAMID BUT BY CHANGING WHAT THEY PARTICULARLY EAT OUT OF IT WE'VE TAKEN THEM OUT OF THEIR NATURAL PYRAMID IN ORDER TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THE PYRAMID IF WE JAM THINGS IN THE BOTTOM CAN GET BACKED UP LIKE A SEWER LINE THAT'S CLOGGED AND IF WE JAM NUTRIENTS SEWAGE FERTILIZER IN THE BASE OF THAT PYRAMID
StephenPalumbi_2010Z IT CAN BACK UP ALL THROUGH IT AND WE END UP WITH THINGS WE'VE HEARD ABOUT BEFORE RED TIDES FOR EXAMPLE WHICH ARE BLOOMS OF TOXIC ALGAE
StephenPalumbi_2010Z WHY DOES THAT HAPPEN IT HAPPENS BECAUSE WE HAVE JAMMED SO MUCH INTO THE BASE OF THE NATURAL OCEAN PYRAMID THAT THESE BACTERIA CLOG IT UP AND OVERFILL ONTO OUR BEACHES OFTEN WHAT JAMS US UP IS SEWAGE
StephenPalumbi_2010Z NOW HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE EVER GONE TO A STATE PARK OR A NATIONAL PARK WHERE YOU HAD A BIG SIGN AT THE FRONT SAYING CLOSED BECAUSE HUMAN SEWAGE IS SO FAR OVER THIS PARK
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THAT YOU CAN'T USE IT NOT VERY OFTEN WE WOULDN'T TOLERATE THAT WE WOULDN'T TOLERATE OUR PARKS BEING
StephenPalumbi_2010Z SWAMPED BY HUMAN SEWAGE BUT BEACHES ARE CLOSED A LOT IN OUR COUNTRY THEY'RE CLOSED MORE AND MORE AND MORE ALL AROUND THE WORLD FOR THE SAME REASON AND I BELIEVE WE SHOULDN 'T TOLERATE THAT EITHER
StephenPalumbi_2010Z IT'S NOT JUST A QUESTION OF CLEANLINESS IT'S ALSO A QUESTION OF HOW THOSE ORGANISMS THEN TURN INTO HUMAN DISEASE THESE VIBRIOS THESE BACTERIA CAN ACTUALLY INFECT PEOPLE
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THEY CAN GO INTO YOUR SKIN AND CREATE SKIN INFECTIONS THIS IS A GRAPH FROM NOAA 'S OCEAN AND HUMAN HEALTH INITIATIVE SHOWING THE RISE OF THE INFECTIONS BY
StephenPalumbi_2010Z IN PEOPLE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS SURFERS FOR EXAMPLE KNOW THIS INCREDIBLY AND IF YOU CAN SEE ON SOME SURFING SITES
StephenPalumbi_2010Z IN FACT NOT ONLY DO YOU SEE WHAT THE WAVES ARE LIKE OR WHAT THE WEATHER 'S LIKE BUT ON SOME SURF RIDER SITES YOU SEE A LITTLE FLASHING
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THAT MEANS THAT THE BEACH MIGHT HAVE GREAT WAVES BUT IT'S A DANGEROUS PLACE FOR SURFERS TO BE BECAUSE THEY CAN CARRY WITH THEM EVEN AFTER A GREAT DAY OF SURFING
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THIS LEGACY OF AN INFECTION THAT MIGHT TAKE A VERY LONG TIME TO SOLVE SOME OF THESE INFECTIONS ARE ACTUALLY CARRYING ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE GENES NOW AND THAT MAKES THEM EVEN MORE DIFFICULT
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THESE SAME INFECTIONS CREATE HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS THOSE BLOOMS ARE GENERATING OTHER KINDS OF CHEMICALS THIS IS JUST A SIMPLE LIST OF SOME OF THE TYPES OF POISONS THAT
StephenPalumbi_2010Z OF THESE HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS SHELLFISH POISONING FISH CIGUATERA DIARRHETIC SHELLFISH POISONING YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THAT NEUROTOXIC SHELLFISH POISONING PARALYTIC SHELLFISH POISONING THESE ARE THINGS
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THAT ARE GETTING INTO OUR FOOD CHAIN BECAUSE OF THESE BLOOMS RITA CALWELL VERY FAMOUSLY TRACED A VERY INTERESTING STORY OF CHOLERA
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THAT THEN LEADS TO HUMAN DISEASE THAT HAS SPARKED CHOLERA EPIDEMICS IN PORTS ALONG THE WORLD AND HAS LED TO INCREASED
StephenPalumbi_2010Z WE HAVE MAJOR PROBLEMS IN DISRUPTED ECOSYSTEM FLOW THAT THE PYRAMID MAY NOT BE WORKING SO WELL THAT THE FLOW FROM THE BASE UP INTO IT
StephenPalumbi_2010Z IS BEING BLOCKED AND CLOGGED WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU HAVE THIS SORT OF DISRUPTED FLOW WELL THERE'S A BUNCH OF THINGS YOU COULD DO
StephenPalumbi_2010Z YOU COULD CALL JOE THE PLUMBER FOR EXAMPLE AND HE COULD COME IN AND FIX THE FLOW BUT IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE WORLD
StephenPalumbi_2010Z NOT ONLY ARE THERE HOPE SPOTS FOR WHERE WE MAY BE ABLE TO FIX PROBLEMS THERE HAVE BEEN PLACES WHERE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN FIXED WHERE PEOPLE HAVE COME TO GRIPS WITH THESE ISSUES AND BEGUN TO TURN THEM AROUND
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THE CANNERIES ARE GONE THE POLLUTION HAS ABATED BUT THERE'S A GREATER SENSE HERE THAT WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES NEED IS WORKING ECOSYSTEMS THEY NEED A FUNCTIONING PYRAMID FROM THE BASE ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP AND
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THAT PYRAMID IN MONTEREY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE EFFORTS OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE IS FUNCTIONING BETTER THAN IT'S EVER FUNCTIONED FOR THE LAST ONE HUNDRED
StephenPalumbi_2010Z FIFTY YEARS IT DIDN'T HAPPEN ACCIDENTALLY IT HAPPENED BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE PUT THEIR TIME AND EFFORT AND THEIR PIONEERING SPIRIT INTO THIS
StephenPalumbi_2010Z ON THE LEFT THERE JULIA PLATT THE MAYOR OF MY LITTLE HOME TOWN IN PACIFIC GROVE AT SEVENTY FOUR YEARS OLD BECAME MAYOR BECAUSE SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE
StephenPalumbi_2010Z RIGHT NEXT TO THE THE BIGGEST POLLUTING CANNERY BECAUSE JULIA KNEW THAT WHEN THE CANNERIES EVENTUALLY WERE GONE THE OCEAN NEEDED A PLACE TO GROW FROM
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THAT THE OCEAN NEEDED A PLACE TO SPARK A SEED AND SHE WANTED TO PROVIDE THAT SEED OTHER PEOPLE DAVID PACKARD AND JULIE PACKARD
StephenPalumbi_2010Z WHO WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN PRODUCING THE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM TO LOCK INTO PEOPLE 'S NOTION THAT THE OCEAN AND THE
StephenPalumbi_2010Z HEALTH OF THE OCEAN ECOSYSTEM WERE JUST AS IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMY OF THIS AREA AS EATING THE ECOSYSTEM WOULD BE THAT CHANGE IN THINKING HAS LED TO A DRAMATIC SHIFT
StephenPalumbi_2010Z THE FORTUNES OF MONTEREY BAY BUT OTHER PLACES AROUND THE WORLD WELL I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE THOUGHT THAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO HERE IS PROTECT THIS OCEAN PYRAMID
StephenPalumbi_2010Z AND THAT OCEAN PYRAMID CONNECTS TO OUR OWN PYRAMID OF LIFE IT'S AN OCEAN PLANET AND WE THINK OF
StephenPalumbi_2010Z IT'S ONLY THROUGH HAVING THE OCEAN BEING HEALTHY THAT WE CAN REMAIN HEALTHY OURSELVES THANK YOU VERY MUCH
