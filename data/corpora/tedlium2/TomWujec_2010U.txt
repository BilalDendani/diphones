TomWujec_2010U@16.26:41.56 SEVERAL YEARS AGO HERE AT TED PETER SKILLMAN INTRODUCED A DESIGN CHALLENGE CALLED THE MARSHMALLOW CHALLENGE AND THE IDEA 'S PRETTY SIMPLE TEAMS OF FOUR HAVE TO BUILD THE TALLEST FREE STANDING STRUCTURE OUT OF TWENTY STICKS OF SPAGHETTI ONE YARD OF TAPE ONE YARD OF STRING AND A MARSHMALLOW THE MARSHMALLOW HAS TO BE ON TOP AND THOUGH IT SEEMS REALLY SIMPLE IT 'S ACTUALLY PRETTY HARD BECAUSE IT FORCES PEOPLE TO COLLABORATE VERY QUICKLY
TomWujec_2010U@41.56:49.2 AND SO I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS AN INTERESTING IDEA AND I INCORPORATED IT INTO A DESIGN WORKSHOP AND IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS AND SINCE THEN I 'VE
TomWujec_2010U@49.2:66.66 CONDUCTED ABOUT SEVENTY DESIGN WORKSHOPS ACROSS THE WORLD WITH STUDENTS AND DESIGNERS AND ARCHITECTS EVEN THE CTOS OF THE FORTUNE FIFTY AND THERE 'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS EXERCISE THAT REVEALS VERY DEEP LESSONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF COLLABORATION AND I 'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF THEM WITH YOU SO
TomWujec_2010U@66.66:87 NORMALLY MOST PEOPLE BEGIN BY ORIENTING THEMSELVES TO THE TASK THEY TALK ABOUT IT THEY FIGURE OUT WHAT IT 'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE THEY JOCKEY FOR POWER THEN THEY SPEND SOME TIME PLANNING ORGANIZING THEY SKETCH IN THEY LAY OUT SPAGHETTI THEY SPEND THE MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME ASSEMBLING THE STICKS INTO EVER GROWING STRUCTURES AND THEN
TomWujec_2010U@87:95.87 FINALLY JUST AS THEY 'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME SOMEONE TAKES OUT THE MARSHMALLOW AND THEN THEY GINGERLY PUT IT ON TOP AND THEY STAND BACK
TomWujec_2010U@95.87:97.48 AND TA DA
TomWujec_2010U@97.48:109.54 THEY ADMIRE THEIR WORK BUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENS MOST OF THE TIME IS THAT THE TA DA TURNS INTO AN UH OH BECAUSE THE WEIGHT OF THE MARSHMALLOW CAUSES THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE TO BUCKLE AND TO COLLAPSE SO
TomWujec_2010U@109.54:116.82 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT MORE UH OH MOMENTS THAN OTHERS AND AMONG THE WORST ARE RECENT GRADUATES OF BUSINESS SCHOOL
TomWujec_2010U@116.82:119.38 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
TomWujec_2010U@119.38:131.52 THEY LIE THEY CHEAT THEY GET DISTRACTED AND THEY PRODUCE REALLY LAME STRUCTURES AND OF COURSE THERE ARE TEAMS THAT HAVE A LOT MORE TA DA STRUCTURES AND AMONG THE BEST ARE RECENT GRADUATES OF KINDERGARTEN

TomWujec_2010U@132.99:133.34 AND
TomWujec_2010U@133.34:134.81 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
TomWujec_2010U@134.81:144.91 IT 'S PRETTY AMAZING AS PETER TELLS US NOT ONLY DO DO THEY PRODUCE THE TALLEST STRUCTURES BUT THEY 'RE THE MOST INTERESTING STRUCTURES OF THEM ALL SO THE QUESTION YOU WANT TO ASK IS HOW COME
TomWujec_2010U@144.91:152.69 WHY WHAT IS IT ABOUT THEM AND PETER LIKES TO SAY THAT NONE OF THIS NONE OF THE KIDS SPEND ANY TIME TRYING TO BE CEO OF SPAGHETTI INC
TomWujec_2010U@152.69:162.19 RIGHT THEY DON 'T TIME SPEND TIME JOCKEYING FOR POWER BUT THERE 'S ANOTHER REASON AS WELL AND THE REASON IS THAT BUSINESS STUDENTS ARE TRAINED TO FIND THE SINGLE RIGHT PLAN
TomWujec_2010U@162.19:169.49 RIGHT AND THEN THEY EXECUTE ON IT AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN THEY PUT THE MARSHMALLOW ON THE TOP THEY RUN OUT OF TIME AND WHAT HAPPENS IT 'S A CRISIS
TomWujec_2010U@169.49:171.316 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
TomWujec_2010U@171.316:179.95 SOUND FAMILIAR RIGHT OK WHAT KINDERGARTENERS DO DIFFERENTLY IS THAT THEY START WITH THE MARSHMALLOW AND THEY BUILD PROTOTYPES SUCCESSIVE PROTOTYPES
TomWujec_2010U@179.95:188.63 ALWAYS KEEPING THE MARSHMALLOW ON TOP SO THEY HAVE MULTIPLE TIMES TO TO FIX ILL BUILT PROTOTYPES ALONG THE WAY SO DESIGNERS RECOGNIZE THIS TYPE OF COLLABORATION
TomWujec_2010U@188.63:196.12 AS THE ESSENCE OF THE ITERATIVE PROCESS AND WITH EACH VERSION KIDS GET INSTANT FEEDBACK ABOUT WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN 'T WORK
TomWujec_2010U@196.12:202 SO THE CAPACITY TO PLAY IN PROTOTYPE IS IS REALLY ESSENTIAL BUT LET 'S LOOK AT HOW DIFFERENT TEAMS PERFORM
TomWujec_2010U@202:213.85 SO THE AVERAGE FOR MOST PEOPLE IS AROUND TWENTY INCHES BUSINESS SCHOOLS STUDENTS ABOUT HALF OF THAT LAWYERS A LITTLE BETTER BUT NOT MUCH BETTER THAN THAT KINDERGARTENERS BETTER THAN MOST ADULTS WHO DOES THE VERY BEST
TomWujec_2010U@213.85:217.67 ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS THANKFULLY AND
TomWujec_2010U@217.67:222.35 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
TomWujec_2010U@222.35:234.55 THIRTY NINE INCHES IS THE TALLEST STRUCTURE I I 'VE SEEN AND WHY IS IT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND TRIANGLES AND SELF RE ENFORCING GEOMETRICAL PATTERNS ARE THE KEY TO BUILDING SELF REINFORCE STABLE STRUCTURES
TomWujec_2010U@234.55:243.81 SO CEOS A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN AVERAGE BUT HERE 'S WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING IF YOU PUT IN AN EXECUTIVE ADMIN ON THE TEAM THEY GET SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER
TomWujec_2010U@243.81:245.54 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
TomWujec_2010U@245.54:246.88 TERRIBLE YOU KNOW
TomWujec_2010U@246.88:260.94 YOU LOOK AROUND YOU GO OH THAT TEAM 'S GOING TO WIN YOU CAN JUST TELL BEFOREHAND AND WHY IS THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE SPECIALS SKILLS OF FACILITATION THEY MANAGE THE PROCESS THEY UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS AND ANY TEAM WHO MANAGES AND PAYS A CLOSE ATTENTION TO TO WORK
TomWujec_2010U@260.94:270.44 WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE TEAM 'S PERFORMANCE SPECIALIZED SKILLS AND FACILITATION SKILLS ARE THE COMBINATION LEADS TO TO STRONG SUCCESS
TomWujec_2010U@270.44:277.76 IF YOU HAVE TEN TEAMS THAT TYPICALLY PERFORM YOU 'LL GET MAYBE SIX OR SO THAT HAVE STANDING STRUCTURES AND I I TRIED SOMETHING INTERESTING I THOUGHT LET 'S
TomWujec_2010U@277.76:286.93 UP THE ANTE ONCE SO I OFFERED A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR PRIZE OF SOFTWARE TO THE WINNING TEAM SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED TO THESE DESIGN STUDENTS WHAT WAS THE RESULT
TomWujec_2010U@286.93:290.55 HERE 'S WHAT HAPPENED
TomWujec_2010U@290.55:311.42 NOT ONE TEAM HAD A STANDING STRUCTURE NOT ONE HAD A A IF ANYONE HAD BUILT SAY A ONE INCH STRUCTURE THEY COULD HAVE TAKEN HOME THE PRIZE SO ISN 'T IT INTERESTING THAT HIGH STAKES HAVE A STRONG IMPACT WE DID THE EXERCISE AGAIN WITH THE SAME STUDENTS WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED THEN SO NOW THEY UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF PROTOTYPING
TomWujec_2010U@311.42:325.19 SO THE SAME TEAM WENT FROM BEING THE VERY WORST TO BEING AMONG THE VERY BEST THEY PRODUCED THE TALLEST STRUCTURES IN THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME SO THERE 'S DEEP LESSONS FOR US ABOUT THE NATURE OF INCENTIVES AND SUCCESS
TomWujec_2010U@325.19:338.57 SO YOU MIGHT ASK WHY WOULD ANYONE ACTUALLY SPEND TIME WRITING A MARSHMALLOW CHALLENGE AND THE REASON IS I HELP CREATE DIGITAL TOOLS AND PROCESSES TO HELP TEAMS BUILD CARS AND VIDEO GAMES AND VISUAL EFFECTS
TomWujec_2010U@338.57:345.12 AND WHAT THE MARSHMALLOW CHALLENGE DOES IS IT HELPS THEM IDENTIFY THE HIDDEN ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE FRANKLY
TomWujec_2010U@345.12:369.27 EVERY PROJECT HAS ITS OWN MARSHMALLOW DOESN 'T IT THE CHALLENGE PROVIDES A SHARED EXPERIENCE A COMMON LANGUAGE A COMMON STANCE TO BUILD THE RIGHT PROTOTYPE AND SO THIS IS THE VALUE OF THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS SO SIMPLE EXERCISE AND THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE INTERESTED MAY WANT TO GO TO MARSHMALLOWCHALLENGE DOT COM IT 'S A BLOG THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT HOW TO BUILD THE MARSHMALLOWS THERE 'S STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS THERE ARE
TomWujec_2010U@369.27:375.43 CRAZY EXAMPLES FROM AROUND THE WORLD OF HOW PEOPLE TWEAK AND ADJUST THE SYSTEM THERE 'S WORLD RECORDS ON THIS AS WELL
TomWujec_2010U@375.43:402.17 AND THE FUNDAMENTAL LESSON I BELIEVE IS THAT DESIGN TRULY IS A CONTACT SPORT IT DEMANDS THAT WE BRING ALL OF OUR SENSES TO THE TASK AND THAT WE APPLY THE VERY BEST OF OUR THINKING OUR FEELING AND OUR DOING TO THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE AT HAND AND SOMETIMES A LITTLE PROTOTYPE OF THIS EXPERIENCE IS ALL THAT IT TAKES TO TURN US FROM AN UH OH MOMENT TO A TA DA MOMENT AND THAT CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
