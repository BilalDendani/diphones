ElaineMorgan_2009G THIS IS TWO THOUSAND AND NINE AND IT'S THE BICENTENNIAL OF CHARLES DARWIN AND ALL OVER THE WORLD EMINENT EVOLUTIONISTS ARE ANXIOUS TO CELEBRATE THIS
ElaineMorgan_2009G AND WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING TO DO IS TO ENLIGHTEN US ON ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF DARWIN AND HIS LIFE AND HOW HE CHANGED OUR THINKING
ElaineMorgan_2009G I SAY ALMOST EVERY ASPECT BECAUSE THERE IS ONE ASPECT OF THIS STORY WHICH THEY HAVE THROWN NO LIGHT ON
ElaineMorgan_2009G AND THEY SEEM ANXIOUS TO SKIRT AROUND IT AND STEP OVER IT AND TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SO I'M GOING TO
ElaineMorgan_2009G THE QUESTION OF
ElaineMorgan_2009G WHY ARE WE SO DIFFERENT FROM THE CHIMPANZEES WE GET
ElaineMorgan_2009G PHENOTYPES THERE'S A CHIMP THERE'S A MAN THEY'RE ASTOUNDINGLY DIFFERENT NO RESEMBLANCE AT ALL I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT AIRY FAIRY STUFF ABOUT CULTURE OR PSYCHOLOGY OR BEHAVIOR I'M TALKING ABOUT
ElaineMorgan_2009G GROUND BASE NITTY GRITTY MEASURABLE PHYSICAL DIFFERENCES THEY THAT ONE IS HAIRY AND WALKING ON FOUR LEGS THAT ONE IS A NAKED BIPED WHY I MEAN
ElaineMorgan_2009G THE ANSWER THEY KNEW WHAT HAPPENED THE ANCESTOR OF THE APES STAYED IN THE TREES
ElaineMorgan_2009G OUR ANCESTORS WENT OUT ONTO THE PLAIN THAT EXPLAINED EVERYTHING WE HAD TO GET UP
ElaineMorgan_2009G OUR LEGS TO PEER OVER THE TALL GRASS OR TO CHASE AFTER ANIMALS OR TO FREE OUR HANDS FOR WEAPONS
ElaineMorgan_2009G AND WE GOT SO OVERHEATED IN THE CHASE THAT WE HAD TO TAKE OFF THAT FUR COAT AND THROW IT AWAY
ElaineMorgan_2009G GENERATIONS BUT THEN IN THE NINETIES SOMETHING
ElaineMorgan_2009G THE PALEONTOLOGISTS THEMSELVES LOOKED A BIT MORE CLOSELY AT THE ACCOMPANYING MICROFAUNA THAT LIVED IN THE SAME TIME AND PLACE AS THE HOMINIDS
ElaineMorgan_2009G AND THEY WEREN'T SAVANNA SPECIES AND THEY LOOKED AT THE HERBIVORES AND THEY WEREN'T SAVANNA HERBIVORES AND THEN THEY WERE SO CLEVER THEY FOUND A WAY TO ANALYZE FOSSILIZED POLLEN
ElaineMorgan_2009G SHOCK HORROR THE FOSSILIZED POLLEN WAS NOT OF SAVANNA VEGETATION SOME OF IT EVEN CAME FROM LIANAS THOSE THINGS THAT DANGLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE JUNGLE SO WE'RE LEFT WITH A SITUATION WHERE
ElaineMorgan_2009G WE KNOW THAT OUR EARLIEST ANCESTORS WERE MOVING AROUND ON IN THE TREES BEFORE THE SAVANNA ECOSYSTEM EVEN CAME INTO
ElaineMorgan_2009G THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I'VE MADE UP IT'S NOT A MINORITY THEORY EVERYBODY AGREES WITH IT PROFESSOR TOBIAS CAME OVER FROM SOUTH
ElaineMorgan_2009G AND SPOKE TO UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON HE SAID EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS FORGET ABOUT IT
ElaineMorgan_2009G IT WAS WRONG WE'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO SQUARE ONE AND START AGAIN IT MADE HIM VERY UNPOPULAR THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK TO SQUARE
ElaineMorgan_2009G I MEAN IT'S A TERRIBLE THING TO HAPPEN YOU'VE GOT THIS BEAUTIFUL PARADIGM YOU'VE BELIEVED IT THROUGH GENERATIONS NOBODY HAS
ElaineMorgan_2009G CONSTRUCTING FANCIFUL THINGS ON TOP OF IT RELYING ON IT TO BE AS SOLID AS A ROCK AND NOW IT'S WHIPPED AWAY FROM UNDER YOU WHAT DO YOU DO
ElaineMorgan_2009G WHAT DOES A SCIENTIST DO IN THAT CASE WELL WE KNOW THE ANSWER BECAUSE THOMAS S KUHN WROTE
ElaineMorgan_2009G IF THEY HAVEN'T GOT A PARADIGM THEY CAN'T ASK THE QUESTION SO THEY SAY YES IT'S WRONG BUT SUPPOSING IT WAS RIGHT
ElaineMorgan_2009G AND
ElaineMorgan_2009G THE ONLY OTHER OPTION OPEN TO THEM IS TO STOP ASKING THE QUESTIONS SO THAT IS WHAT THEY HAVE DONE NOW THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T HEAR THEM TALKING ABOUT IT IT'S YESTERDAY 'S QUESTION
ElaineMorgan_2009G SOME OF THEM HAVE EVEN ELEVATED IT INTO A PRINCIPLE IT'S WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE DOING AARON FILLER FROM HARVARD SAID
ElaineMorgan_2009G TIME WE STOPPED TALKING ABOUT SELECTIVE PRESSURES I MEAN WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT WELL THERE'S CHROMOSOMES AND THERE'S GENES AND WE JUST RECORD WHAT WE SEE
ElaineMorgan_2009G CHARLES DARWIN MUST BE SPINNING IN HIS GRAVE HE KNEW ALL ABOUT THAT KIND OF SCIENCE AND HE CALLED IT HYPOTHESIS FREE SCIENCE AND HE DESPISED IT FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART AND
ElaineMorgan_2009G IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAY I 'M GOING TO STOP TALKING ABOUT SELECTIVE PRESSURES YOU CAN TAKE THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES AND THROW IT OUT OF THE WINDOW FOR IT'S ABOUT NOTHING ELSE BUT SELECTIVE PRESSURES
ElaineMorgan_2009G AND THE IRONY OF IT IS THAT THIS IS ONE OCCASION OF A PARADIGM COLLAPSE WHERE WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR A NEW PARADIGM TO COME UP
ElaineMorgan_2009G HE KEPT IT TO HIMSELF FOR THIRTY YEARS BUT THEN THE PRESS GOT HOLD OF IT AND ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE ALL HIS COLLEAGUES SAID THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS YOU'VE EXPOSED US TO PUBLIC RIDICULE YOU MUST NEVER DO THAT AGAIN
ElaineMorgan_2009G AND AT THAT TIME IT BECAME SET IN STONE THE AQUATIC THEORY SHOULD BE DUMPED WITH THE UFOS AND THE YETIS AS PART OF THE LUNATIC FRINGE
ElaineMorgan_2009G OF SCIENCE WELL I DON'T THINK THAT I THINK THAT HARDY HAD A LOT GOING FOR HIM I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT JUST A HANDFUL OF WHAT HAVE BEEN CALLED THE
ElaineMorgan_2009G HALLMARKS OF MANKIND THE THINGS THAT MADE US DIFFERENT FROM EVERYBODY ELSE AND ALL OUR RELATIVES LET 'S LOOK AT OUR NAKED SKIN
ElaineMorgan_2009G IT'S OBVIOUS THAT MOST OF THE THINGS WE THINK ABOUT THAT HAVE LOST THEIR BODY HAIR MAMMALS WITHOUT BODY HAIR
ElaineMorgan_2009G ARE AQUATIC ONES LIKE THE DUGONG THE WALRUS THE DOLPHIN THE HIPPOPOTAMUS THE MANATEE AND A COUPLE OF
ElaineMorgan_2009G WALLOWERS IN MUD LIKE THE BABIRUSA AND YOU'RE TEMPTED TO THINK WELL PERHAPS COULD THAT BE
ElaineMorgan_2009G WOMAN SHE'S OFF AGAIN SHE'LL SAY ANYTHING WON 'T SHE BUT BY NOW EVERYBODY AGREES THAT THE ELEPHANT
ElaineMorgan_2009G LAST YEAR IN FLORIDA THEY FOUND EXTINCT ANCESTOR OF A RHINOCEROS AND SAID SEEMS TO HAVE SPENT MOST OF ITS TIME IN THE WATER
ElaineMorgan_2009G SO THIS IS A CLOSE CONNECTION BETWEEN NAKEDNESS AND WATER AS AN ABSOLUTE CONNECTION IT ONLY WORKS ONE WAY YOU CAN'T SAY ALL AQUATIC ANIMALS
ElaineMorgan_2009G NAKED BECAUSE LOOK AT THE SEA OTTER BUT YOU CAN SAY THAT EVERY ANIMAL THAT HAS BECOME NAKED HAS BEEN CONDITIONED BY WATER IN ITS OWN LIFETIME
ElaineMorgan_2009G LIFETIME OF ITS ANCESTORS I THINK THIS IS SIGNIFICANT THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS THE NAKED SOMALIAN MOLE RAT WHICH NEVER PUTS ITS NOSE ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND
ElaineMorgan_2009G ALL THE APES AND ALL THE MONKEYS ARE CAPABLE OF WALKING ON TWO LEGS IF THEY WANT TO FOR A SHORT TIME THERE IS ONLY ONE CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH THEY ALWAYS ALL OF THEM WALK ON TWO LEGS AND THAT IS WHEN THEY ARE WADING THROUGH WATER
ElaineMorgan_2009G DO YOU THINK THAT'S SIGNIFICANT DAVID ATTENBOROUGH THINKS IT'S SIGNIFICANT AS THE POSSIBLE BEGINNING OF OUR BIPEDALISM
ElaineMorgan_2009G FAT LAYER WE HAVE GOT UNDER OUR SKIN A LAYER OF FAT ALL OVER NOTHING IN THE LEAST LIKE THAT IN ANY OTHER PRIMATE
ElaineMorgan_2009G WHY SHOULD IT BE THERE WELL THEY DO KNOW THAT IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER AQUATIC MAMMALS THE FAT THAT IN MOST LAND MAMMALS IS DEPOSITED INSIDE THE BODY WALL
ElaineMorgan_2009G AROUND THE KIDNEYS AND THE INTESTINES AND SO ON HAS STARTED TO MIGRATE TO THE OUTSIDE AND SPREAD OUT IN A LAYER INSIDE THE SKIN IN THE WHALE IT'S COMPLETE NO FAT INSIDE AT ALL ALL IN BLUBBER OUTSIDE
ElaineMorgan_2009G WE CAN NOT AVOID THE SUSPICION THAT IN OUR CASE IT'S STARTED TO HAPPEN WE HAVE GOT SKIN
ElaineMorgan_2009G WITH THIS LAYER IT'S THE ONLY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF WHY HUMANS IF THEY'RE VERY
ElaineMorgan_2009G CAN BECOME GROSSLY OBESE IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY OTHER PRIMATE PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE SOMETHING VERY ODD NEVER EXPLAINED
ElaineMorgan_2009G THE QUESTION OF WHY WE CAN SPEAK WE CAN SPEAK AND THE GORILLA CAN'T SPEAK WHY NOTHING TO DO WITH HIS TEETH OR HIS TONGUE OR HIS LUNGS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT HAS TO DO
ElaineMorgan_2009G WITH ITS CONSCIOUS CONTROL OF ITS BREATH YOU CAN'T EVEN TRAIN A GORILLA TO SAY AH ON REQUEST
ElaineMorgan_2009G ONLY CREATURES THAT HAVE GOT CONSCIOUS CONTROL OF THEIR BREATH ARE THE DIVING ANIMALS AND THE DIVING BIRDS IT WAS
ElaineMorgan_2009G ABSOLUTE PRECONDITION FOR OUR BEING ABLE TO SPEAK AND THEN AGAIN THERE IS THE FACT THAT WE ARE STREAMLINED
ElaineMorgan_2009G TRYING TO SUGGEST THAT FOR FORTY ODD YEARS THIS AQUATIC IDEA HAS BEEN MISCATEGORIZED AS LUNATIC FRINGE AND IT IS NOT LUNATIC FRINGE AND THE IRONIC THING ABOUT IT IS
ElaineMorgan_2009G THEY ARE NOT STAVING OFF THE AQUATIC THEORY TO PROTECT A THEORY OF THEIR OWN WHICH THEY'VE ALL AGREED ON AND THEY LOVE THERE'S NOTHING THERE THEY ARE STAVING OFF THE AQUATIC THEORY TO PROTECT A VACUUM
ElaineMorgan_2009G HOW DO THEY REACT WHEN I SAY THESE THINGS ONE VERY COMMON REACTION I'VE HEARD ABOUT TWENTY TIMES IS BUT IT WAS INVESTIGATED
ElaineMorgan_2009G THEY CONDUCTED A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION OF THIS AT THE BEGINNING WHEN HARDY PUT FORWARD HIS ARTICLE
ElaineMorgan_2009G I DON'T BELIEVE IT FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR ANY EVIDENCE OF ANY INCIDENT OF THAT KIND AND I'VE CONCLUDED THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE URBAN MYTHS IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE
ElaineMorgan_2009G I ASK PEOPLE SOMETIMES AND THEY SAY I LIKE THE AQUATIC THEORY EVERYBODY LIKES THE AQUATIC THEORY
ElaineMorgan_2009G OF COURSE THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT BUT THEY LIKE IT WELL I SAY WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S RUBBISH THEY SAY WELL EVERYBODY
ElaineMorgan_2009G ALL BE WRONG CAN THEY THE ANSWER TO THAT LOUD AND CLEAR IS YES
ElaineMorgan_2009G AND IF YOU'VE GOT A SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM LIKE THAT YOU CAN'T SOLVE IT BY HOLDING A HEAD COUNT AND SAYING MORE
ElaineMorgan_2009G APART FROM THAT SOME OF THE HEADS COUNT MORE THAN OTHERS SOME OF THEM HAVE COME OVER THERE WAS PROFESSOR TOBIAS
ElaineMorgan_2009G HE 'S COME OVER DANIEL DENNETT HE 'S COME OVER SIR DAVID ATTENBOROUGH HE 'S COME OVER ANYBODY ELSE
ElaineMorgan_2009G WE'VE GOT TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE ULTIMATELY ONE OF THREE THINGS IS GOING TO HAPPEN EITHER THEY WILL GO ON FOR THE NEXT FORTY YEARS FIFTY YEARS SIXTY YEARS YEAH WELL WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT LET 'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING INTERESTING
ElaineMorgan_2009G BE VERY SAD THE SECOND THING THAT COULD HAPPEN IS THAT SOME YOUNG GENIUS WILL ARRIVE AND SAY I 'VE FOUND IT IT WAS NOT THE SAVANNA IT WAS NOT THE WATER IT WAS
ElaineMorgan_2009G HAPPENING EITHER I DON'T THINK THERE IS A THIRD OPTION SO THE THIRD THING THAT MIGHT HAPPEN IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL THING IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THE EARLY YEARS OF THE LAST CENTURY
ElaineMorgan_2009G THERE WAS A STAND OFF A LOT OF BICKERING AND BAD FEELING BETWEEN THE BELIEVERS IN MENDEL AND THE BELIEVERS IN DARWIN
ElaineMorgan_2009G IT ENDED WITH A NEW SYNTHESIS DARWIN 'S IDEAS AND MENDEL 'S IDEAS BLENDING TOGETHER
ElaineMorgan_2009G AND I THINK THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN HERE YOU'LL GET A NEW SYNTHESIS HARDY 'S IDEAS AND DARWIN 'S IDEAS WILL BE BLENDED TOGETHER
ElaineMorgan_2009G AND WE CAN MOVE FORWARD FROM THERE AND REALLY GET SOMEWHERE THAT WOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL THING IT WOULD BE VERY NICE FOR ME
ElaineMorgan_2009G WAS WHEN HE SAID AT MY AGE I DON'T EVEN
ElaineMorgan_2009G SO IF
ElaineMorgan_2009G WHAT'S HOLDING
ElaineMorgan_2009G THE PROFESSIONAL JOURNALS WON 'T TOUCH IT WITH A BARGE POLE THE TEXT BOOKS DON'T MENTION IT THE SYLLABUS DOESN'T MENTION EVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE NAKED LET ALONE LOOK FOR A REASON TO
ElaineMorgan_2009G IT EXCEPT IN JOCULAR REFERENCES TO PEOPLE ON THE LUNATIC FRINGE I DON'T
ElaineMorgan_2009G QUITE WHERE THIS DIKTAT
ElaineMorgan_2009G SOMEBODY
ElaineMorgan_2009G IS ISSUING THE COMMANDMENT THOU SHALT NOT BELIEVE IN THE AQUATIC THEORY
ElaineMorgan_2009G AND IF YOU HOPE TO MAKE PROGRESS IN THIS PROFESSION AND YOU DO BELIEVE IT YOU'D BETTER KEEP IT TO YOURSELF BECAUSE IT WILL GET IN YOUR WAY
ElaineMorgan_2009G THE IMPRESSION THAT SOME PARTS OF THE SCIENTIFIC ESTABLISHMENT ARE MORPHING INTO A KIND OF
ElaineMorgan_2009G PRIESTHOOD BUT YOU KNOW THAT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD BECAUSE RICHARD DAWKINS HAS TOLD US HOW TO TREAT A PRIESTHOOD
ElaineMorgan_2009G HE SAYS
ElaineMorgan_2009G TO GIVE IT ALL THE EXCESSIVE AWE AND REVERENCE IT'S BEEN TRAINED TO RECEIVE RIGHT
ElaineMorgan_2009G AND SECONDLY HE SAYS YOU MUST NEVER BE AFRAID TO ROCK THE BOAT
