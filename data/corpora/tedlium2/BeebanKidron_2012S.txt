BeebanKidron_2012S FROM MOTHER TO DAUGHTER PREACHER TO CONGREGANT TEACHER TO PUPIL STORYTELLER TO AUDIENCE WHETHER IN CAVE PAINTINGS OR THE LATEST USES OF THE INTERNET HUMAN BEINGS HAVE ALWAYS TOLD THEIR HISTORIES AND TRUTHS THROUGH PARABLE AND FABLE WE ARE INVETERATE STORYTELLERS
BeebanKidron_2012S AND WHAT NARRATIVE
BeebanKidron_2012S WHAT HISTORY WHAT IDENTITY
BeebanKidron_2012S WHAT MORAL CODE ARE WE IMPARTING TO OUR YOUNG
BeebanKidron_2012S CINEMA IS ARGUABLY THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 'S MOST INFLUENTIAL ART FORM ITS ARTISTS TOLD STORIES ACROSS NATIONAL BOUNDARIES IN AS MANY LANGUAGES GENRES AND PHILOSOPHIES AS ONE CAN IMAGINE INDEED IT IS HARD TO FIND A SUBJECT THAT FILM HAS YET TO TACKLE
BeebanKidron_2012S DURING THE LAST DECADE WE 'VE SEEN A VAST INTEGRATION OF GLOBAL MEDIA NOW DOMINATED BY A CULTURE OF THE HOLLYWOOD BLOCKBUSTER
BeebanKidron_2012S WE ARE INCREASINGLY OFFERED A DIET IN WHICH SENSATION NOT STORY IS KING
BeebanKidron_2012S AS A FILMMAKER IT WORRIED ME
BeebanKidron_2012S OF WHERE THEY 'VE COME FROM AND SO FEW NARRATIVES OF WHAT 'S POSSIBLE
BeebanKidron_2012S TECHNICAL ACCESS HAS NEVER BEEN GREATER CULTURAL
BeebanKidron_2012S GIVEN THE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY
BeebanKidron_2012S EVEN A SCHOOL IN A TINY RURAL HAMLET
BeebanKidron_2012S COULD PROJECT A DVD ONTO A WHITE
BeebanKidron_2012S IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS WE RAN TWENTY FIVE CLUBS ACROSS THE U K WITH KIDS IN AGE GROUPS BETWEEN FIVE AND EIGHTEEN WATCHING A FILM UNINTERRUPTED FOR NINETY MINUTES
BeebanKidron_2012S THE OUTCOME IMMEDIATE
BeebanKidron_2012S IT WAS AN EDUCATION OF THE MOST PROFOUND AND TRANSFORMATIVE KIND
BeebanKidron_2012S WE HAD THE NAMES OF A THOUSAND SCHOOLS THAT WISHED TO JOIN
BeebanKidron_2012S TECHNOLOGY THEN MEANT WE HAD TO HIRE A VIEWING CINEMA FIND AND PAY FOR THE PRINT AND THE PROJECTIONIST BUT FOR MY FATHER
BeebanKidron_2012S WAS SO GREAT THAT HE CHOSE TO CELEBRATE HIS HALF CENTURY WITH HIS THREE TEENAGE CHILDREN AND THIRTY OF THEIR FRIENDS IN ORDER HE SAID
BeebanKidron_2012S TO PASS THE BATON OF CONCERN AND HOPE ON TO THE NEXT GENERATION
BeebanKidron_2012S SIXTY YEARS AFTER THE FILM WAS MADE AND THIRTY YEARS AFTER I FIRST SAW IT I SEE YOUNG FACES TILT UP IN AWE THEIR INCREDULITY MATCHING MINE AND THE SPEED WITH WHICH THEY ASSOCIATE IT WITH SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE OR THE FAVELAS IN RIO SPEAKS TO THE ENDURING NATURE
BeebanKidron_2012S IN A FILMCLUB SEASON ABOUT DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNMENT WE SCREENED MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON MADE IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE THE FILM IS OLDER THAN MOST OF OUR MEMBERS GRANDPARENTS
BeebanKidron_2012S SHORTLY AFTER MR SMITH BECAME A FILMCLUB CLASSIC THERE WAS A WEEK OF ALL NIGHT FILIBUSTERING IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND IT WAS WITH GREAT DELIGHT THAT WE FOUND YOUNG PEOPLE UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY EXPLAINING WITH AUTHORITY
BeebanKidron_2012S IN CHOOSING HOTEL RWANDA THEY EXPLORED GENOCIDE OF THE MOST BRUTAL KIND
BeebanKidron_2012S IT PROVOKED TEARS AS WELL AS INCISIVE QUESTIONS ABOUT UNARMED PEACE KEEPING FORCES AND THE DOUBLE DEALING OF A WESTERN SOCIETY THAT PICKS ITS MORAL FIGHTS WITH COMMODITIES IN MIND AND WHEN SCHINDLER 'S LIST DEMANDED THAT THEY NEVER FORGET ONE CHILD FULL OF THE PAIN OF CONSCIOUSNESS
BeebanKidron_2012S OTHERWISE HOW DID HOTEL RWANDA HAPPEN
BeebanKidron_2012S AS THEY WATCH MORE FILMS THEIR LIVES GOT PALPABLY RICHER PICKPOCKET STARTED A DEBATE ABOUT CRIMINALITY DISENFRANCHISEMENT
BeebanKidron_2012S TO SIR WITH LOVE IGNITED ITS TEEN AUDIENCE THEY CELEBRATED A CHANGE IN ATTITUDE TOWARDS NON WHITE BRITONS BUT RAILED AGAINST OUR RESTLESS SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT VALUE COLLECTIVE IDENTITY UNLIKE
BeebanKidron_2012S BY NOW THESE THOUGHTFUL OPINIONATED CURIOUS YOUNG PEOPLE THOUGHT NOTHING OF TACKLING FILMS OF ALL FORMS BLACK AND WHITE SUBTITLED DOCUMENTARY NON NARRATIVE FANTASY
BeebanKidron_2012S FROM TWENTY FIVE CLUBS WE BECAME HUNDREDS THEN THOUSANDS UNTIL WE WERE NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILLION KIDS IN SEVEN THOUSAND CLUBS RIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY
BeebanKidron_2012S AND ALTHOUGH THE NUMBERS WERE AND CONTINUE TO BE EXTRAORDINARY WHAT BECAME MORE EXTRAORDINARY WAS HOW THE EXPERIENCE OF CRITICAL AND CURIOUS QUESTIONING TRANSLATED INTO LIFE
BeebanKidron_2012S SOME OF OUR KIDS STARTED TALKING WITH THEIR PARENTS OTHERS WITH THEIR TEACHERS OR WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND THOSE WITHOUT FRIENDS
BeebanKidron_2012S AND JAWS BECAME THE WAY IN WHICH ONE YOUNG BOY WAS ABLE TO ARTICULATE THE FEAR HE 'D EXPERIENCED IN FLIGHT FROM VIOLENCE THAT KILLED FIRST HIS FATHER THEN HIS MOTHER THE LATTER THROWN OVERBOARD ON A BOAT JOURNEY
BeebanKidron_2012S THEY BEGAN TO SEE THEMSELVES
BeebanKidron_2012S I WAS PAST FORTY WHEN MY FATHER DIED
BeebanKidron_2012S HE NEVER MENTIONED THAT JOURNEY
BeebanKidron_2012S MY MOTHER 'S MOTHER
BeebanKidron_2012S LEFT EUROPE IN A HURRY WITHOUT HER HUSBAND BUT WITH HER THREE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER
BeebanKidron_2012S AFTER TWO YEARS IN HIDING
BeebanKidron_2012S MY GRANDFATHER APPEARED IN LONDON HE WAS NEVER RIGHT AGAIN
BeebanKidron_2012S AND HIS STORY WAS HUSHED
BeebanKidron_2012S I HAD ANNE FRANK THE GREAT ESCAPE SHOAH TRIUMPH OF THE WILL
BeebanKidron_2012S AND THEY BECAME MORE USEFUL TO ME
BeebanKidron_2012S PURISTS MAY FEEL THAT FICTION DISSIPATES THE QUEST OF REAL HUMAN UNDERSTANDING THAT FILM IS TOO CRUDE TO TELL A COMPLEX AND DETAILED HISTORY OR THAT FILMMAKERS ALWAYS SERVE DRAMA OVER TRUTH
BeebanKidron_2012S AS ONE TWELVE YEAR OLD SAID AFTER WATCHING WIZARD OF OZ EVERY PERSON SHOULD WATCH THIS BECAUSE UNLESS YOU DO YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT YOU TOO HAVE A HEART
BeebanKidron_2012S WE HONOR READING WHY NOT HONOR WATCHING WITH THE SAME PASSION CONSIDER CITIZEN KANE AS VALUABLE AS JANE AUSTEN AGREE THAT BOYZ N THE HOOD LIKE TENNYSON OFFERS AN EMOTIONAL LANDSCAPE AND A HEIGHTENED UNDERSTANDING THAT WORK TOGETHER EACH A PIECE OF MEMORABLE ART
BeebanKidron_2012S EACH A BRICK IN THE WALL OF WHO WE ARE
BeebanKidron_2012S AND NO LESS HELPFUL TO UNDERSTANDING OUR LIFE AND TIMES AS SHAKESPEARE IS IN ILLUMINATING THE WORLD OF ELIZABETHAN ENGLAND
BeebanKidron_2012S WHAT WE COULD NOT HAVE FORESEEN WAS THE MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN BEHAVIOR CONFIDENCE AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT ONCE RELUCTANT STUDENTS NOW RACE TO SCHOOL TALK TO THEIR TEACHERS FIGHT NOT ON THE PLAYGROUND BUT TO CHOOSE NEXT WEEK 'S FILM
BeebanKidron_2012S YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE FOUND SELF DEFINITION
BeebanKidron_2012S OUR MEMBERS DEFY THE BINARY DESCRIPTION OF HOW WE SO OFTEN DESCRIBE OUR YOUNG
BeebanKidron_2012S THEY ARE LIKE OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE NEGOTIATING A WORLD WITH INFINITE CHOICE BUT LITTLE CULTURE OF HOW TO FIND MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCE
BeebanKidron_2012S WE APPEARED SURPRISED AT THE BEHAVIORS OF THOSE WHO DEFINE THEMSELVES BY THE SIZE OF THE TICK ON THEIR SHOES YET ACQUISITION HAS BEEN THE NARRATIVE WE HAVE OFFERED
BeebanKidron_2012S IF WE WANT DIFFERENT VALUES WE HAVE TO TELL A DIFFERENT STORY
BeebanKidron_2012S A STORY THAT UNDERSTANDS THAT AN INDIVIDUAL NARRATIVE IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF A PERSON 'S IDENTITY THAT A COLLECTIVE NARRATIVE IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF A CULTURAL IDENTITY AND WITHOUT IT
BeebanKidron_2012S IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE YOURSELF AS PART OF A GROUP BECAUSE WHEN THESE PEOPLE
BeebanKidron_2012S GET HOME AFTER A SCREENING OF REAR WINDOW AND RAISE THEIR GAZE TO THE BUILDING NEXT DOOR THEY HAVE THE TOOLS TO WONDER
