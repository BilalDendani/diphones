DavidLogan_2009 REALLY HERE TO TALK ABOUT IS THE HOW OKAY SO HOW EXACTLY DO WE CREATE THIS WORLD SHATTERING IF YOU WILL INNOVATION
DavidLogan_2009 NOTICED AS WE BEGAN TO DEBRIEF VARIOUS SUPER BOWL PARTIES IS THAT IT SEEMED TO US THAT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES IF YOU WILL TRIBAL COUNCILS HAD CONVENED
DavidLogan_2009 AND THEY HAD DISCUSSED THINGS OF GREAT NATIONAL IMPORTANCE LIKE DO WE LIKE THE BUDWEISER COMMERCIAL AND DO WE LIKE THE NACHOS AND WHO IS GOING TO WIN
DavidLogan_2009 BUT THEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT WHICH CANDIDATE THEY WERE GOING TO SUPPORT AND IF YOU GO BACK IN TIME TO FEBRUARY THREE RD IT LOOKED LIKE HILARY CLINTON WAS GOING TO GET THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION AND THERE WERE EVEN SOME POLLS THAT WERE SAYING SHE WAS GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY
DavidLogan_2009 BUT WHEN WE TALKED TO PEOPLE IT APPEARED THAT A FUNNEL EFFECT HAD HAPPENED IN THESE TRIBES ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES NOW WHAT IS A TRIBE TRIBE IS A GROUP OF ABOUT TWENTY SO KIND OF MORE THAN A TEAM
DavidLogan_2009 IF YOU WILL REPRESENTATIVES FROM VARIOUS TRIBAL COUNCILS THAT MET ALSO KNOWN AS SUPER BOWL PARTIES WE SENT THE FOLLOWING EMAIL OFF TO FORTY NEWSPAPER EDITORS THE FOLLOWING DAY FEBRUARY FOURTH WE POSTED IT ON OUR
DavidLogan_2009 THE REASON WE KNEW THAT WAS BECAUSE WE SPENT THE PREVIOUS TEN YEARS STUDYING TRIBES STUDYING THESE NATURALLY OCCURRING GROUPS ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF TRIBES IN WALKING AROUND
DavidLogan_2009 AT THE BREAK MANY OF YOU HAD MET MEMBERS OF YOUR TRIBE AND YOU WERE TALKING TO THEM AND MANY OF YOU WERE DOING WHAT GREAT IF YOU WILL TRIBAL LEADERS DO
DavidLogan_2009 WHICH IS TO FIND SOMEONE WHO IS A MEMBER OF A TRIBE AND TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE WHO IS ANOTHER MEMBER OF A DIFFERENT TRIBE AND MAKE INTRODUCTIONS THAT IS IN FACT WHAT GREAT TRIBAL LEADERS DO SO HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE
DavidLogan_2009 IF YOU FOCUS IN ON A GROUP LIKE THIS THIS HAPPENS TO BE A USC GAME AND YOU ZOOM IN WITH ONE OF THOSE SUPER SATELLITE CAMERAS AND DO MAGNIFICATION FACTORS SO YOU COULD SEE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE YOU WOULD IN FACT SEE NOT A SINGLE CROWD
DavidLogan_2009 AND SO PEOPLE FORM TRIBES THEY ALWAYS HAVE THEY ALWAYS WILL JUST AS FISH SWIM AND BIRDS FLY PEOPLE FORM TRIBES IT'S JUST WHAT WE DO BUT HERE 'S THE RUB NOT ALL TRIBES ARE THE SAME
DavidLogan_2009 AND WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE IS THE CULTURE NOW HERE IS THE NET OUT OF THIS YOU'RE ALL A MEMBER OF TRIBES IF YOU CAN FIND A WAY TO TAKE THE TRIBES THAT
DavidLogan_2009 AND NUDGE THEM FORWARD ALONG THESE TRIBAL STAGES TO WHAT WE CALL STAGE FIVE WHICH IS THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN BUT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH WHAT WE CALL STAGE ONE
DavidLogan_2009 NOW THIS IS THE LOWEST OF THE STAGES YOU DON'T WANT THIS OKAY THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULT IMAGE TO PUT UP ON THE SCREEN BUT IT'S ONE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO LEARN FROM
DavidLogan_2009 STAGE ONE PRODUCES PEOPLE WHO DO HORRIBLE THINGS THIS IS THE KID WHO SHOT UP VIRGINIA TECH
DavidLogan_2009 STAGE ONE IS A GROUP WHERE PEOPLE SYSTEMATICALLY SEVER RELATIONSHIPS FROM FUNCTIONAL TRIBES AND THEN POOL TOGETHER WITH PEOPLE WHO THINK LIKE THEY DO
DavidLogan_2009 STAGE ONE IS LITERALLY THE CULTURE OF GANGS AND IT IS THE CULTURE OF PRISONS NOW AGAIN WE DON'T OFTEN DEAL WITH STAGE ONE AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT AS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
DavidLogan_2009 IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SIMPLY WRITE PEOPLE OFF BUT LET 'S MOVE ON TO STAGE TWO NOW STAGE ONE YOU'LL NOTICE SAYS IN EFFECT LIFE SUCKS SO THIS OTHER BOOK THAT STEVE MENTIONED
DavidLogan_2009 THAT JUST CAME OUT CALLED THE THREE LAWS OF PERFORMANCE MY COLLEAGUE STEVE ZAFFRON AND I ARGUE THAT AS PEOPLE SEE THE WORLD SO THEY BEHAVE WELL IF PEOPLE SEE THE WORLD
DavidLogan_2009 IN SUCH A WAY THAT LIFE SUCKS THEN THEIR BEHAVIOR WILL FOLLOW AUTOMATICALLY FROM THAT IT WILL BE DESPAIRING HOSTILITY THEY'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SURVIVE EVEN IF THAT MEANS UNDERMINING OTHER PEOPLE NOW MY BIRTHDAY IS COMING UP
DavidLogan_2009 NOW AM I SAYING THAT IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES ACROSS THE LAND YOU FIND A STAGE TWO CULTURE
DavidLogan_2009 NO BUT IN THE ONE NEAR ME WHERE I HAVE TO GO IN JUST A FEW DAYS WHAT I WILL SAY WHEN I'M STANDING IN LINE IS HOW CAN PEOPLE BE SO DUMB AND YET LIVE
DavidLogan_2009 THERE ARE DUMB PEOPLE WORKING HERE ACTUALLY NO I'M NOT BUT I'M SAYING THE CULTURE MAKES PEOPLE DUMB SO IN A STAGE TWO CULTURE AND WE FIND THESE IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT PLACES YOU FIND THEM IN FACT IN THE BEST
DavidLogan_2009 IF I GOT TO GO TO TEDX USC MY LIFE WOULDN'T SUCK BUT I DON 'T SO IT DOES IF THAT'S HOW YOU TALKED IMAGINE WHAT KIND OF WORK WOULD GET DONE
DavidLogan_2009 WHAT KIND OF INNOVATION WOULD GET DONE THE AMOUNT OF WORLD CHANGING BEHAVIOR THAT WOULD HAPPEN IN FACT IT WOULD BE BASICALLY
DavidLogan_2009 NOW WHEN WE GO ON TO STAGE THREE THIS IS THE ONE THAT HITS CLOSEST TO HOME FOR MANY OF US BECAUSE IT IS IN STAGE THREE THAT MANY OF US MOVE AND WE PARK AND WE STAY STAGE THREE SAYS I 'M GREAT
DavidLogan_2009 AND YOU'RE NOT
DavidLogan_2009 WHOLE ROOM OF PEOPLE SAYING IN EFFECT I 'M GREAT AND YOU'RE NOT OR I 'M GOING TO FIND SOME WAY TO COMPETE WITH YOU AND COME OUT ON TOP AS A RESULT OF THAT A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE
DavidLogan_2009 AND THE OTHER SAID NO THAT'S GREAT CONGRATULATIONS THE NEXT ONE GOT KIND OF A WRY SMILE ON HIS FACE AND SAID
DavidLogan_2009 YOU WERE YOU KNOW DOING YOUR RESEARCH NOTICE THE CONDESCENDING TONE WHILE YOU WERE OFF DOING YOUR RESEARCH I WAS OFF DOING MORE SURGERIES THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY AT THIS INSTITUTION
DavidLogan_2009 THE THIRD ONE GOT THE SAME WRY SMILE AND SAID WELL WHILE YOU WERE OFF DOING YOUR RESEARCH AND YOU WERE OFF DOING YOUR MONKEY MEATBALL SURGERY THAT EVENTUALLY WE'LL TRAIN
DavidLogan_2009 WE FIND THESE IN PLACES WHERE REALLY SMART SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE SHOW UP LIKE OH I DON'T KNOW
DavidLogan_2009 HERE IS THE GREATEST CHALLENGE WE FACE IN INNOVATION IT IS MOVING FROM STAGE THREE TO STAGE FOUR LET 'S TAKE A LOOK AT A
DavidLogan_2009 QUICK VIDEO SNIPPET THIS IS FROM A COMPANY CALLED ZAPPOS LOCATED OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS AND MY QUESTION ON THE OTHER SIDE IS JUST GOING TO BE WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY VALUE
DavidLogan_2009 TIME THERE WAS A CHRISTMAS TREE THIS IS THEIR LOBBY
DavidLogan_2009 WE ARE AND THEY DON'T CARE
DavidLogan_2009 NOTICE THE LEVEL
DavidLogan_2009 ONE OF THEIR STATED VALUES IS BE A LITTLE BIT WEIRD AND YOU'LL NOTICE THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT WEIRD
DavidLogan_2009 SO WHEN INDIVIDUALS COME TOGETHER AND FIND SOMETHING THAT UNITES THEM THAT'S GREATER THAN THEIR INDIVIDUAL COMPETENCE THEN SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAPPENS THE GROUP GELS AND IT CHANGES FROM A GROUP OF HIGHLY MOTIVATED BUT
DavidLogan_2009 STAGE FOUR TRIBES CAN DO REMARKABLE THINGS BUT YOU'LL NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN YET THERE IS IN FACT ANOTHER STAGE
DavidLogan_2009 NOW SOME OF YOU MAY NOT RECOGNIZE THE SCENE THAT'S UP HERE AND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE HEADLINE OF STAGE FIVE WHICH IS LIFE IS GREAT THIS MAY SEEM A LITTLE INCONGRUOUS THIS IS A SCENE OR SNIPPET FROM THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION PROCESS IN SOUTH AFRICA
DavidLogan_2009 FOR WHICH DESMOND TUTU WON THE NOBEL PRIZE NOW THINK ABOUT THAT SOUTH AFRICA TERRIBLE ATROCITIES HAD HAPPENED IN THE SOCIETY AND PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER
DavidLogan_2009 ONLY ON THOSE TWO VALUES TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION THERE WAS NO ROAD MAP NO ONE HAD EVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE
DavidLogan_2009 AND IN THIS ATMOSPHERE WHERE THE ONLY GUIDANCE WAS PEOPLE 'S VALUES AND THEIR NOBLE CAUSE WHAT THIS GROUP ACCOMPLISHED WAS HISTORIC
DavidLogan_2009 AND PEOPLE AT THE TIME FEARED THAT SOUTH AFRICA WOULD END UP GOING THE WAY THAT RWANDA HAS GONE DESCENDING INTO ONE SKIRMISH AFTER ANOTHER IN A CIVIL WAR THAT SEEMS TO HAVE NO
DavidLogan_2009 IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT GONE DOWN THAT ROAD LARGELY BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE DESMOND TUTU SET UP A STAGE FIVE PROCESS TO
DavidLogan_2009 THE THOUSANDS AND PERHAPS MILLIONS OF TRIBES IN THE COUNTRY TO BRING EVERYONE TOGETHER SO PEOPLE HEAR THIS AND THEY CONCLUDE THE FOLLOWING AS DID WE IN DOING THE STUDY OKAY GOT IT
DavidLogan_2009 I DON'T WANT TO TALK STAGE ONE THAT'S LIKE YOU KNOW LIFE SUCKS WHO WANTS TO TALK THAT WAY I DON'T WANT TO TALK LIKE THEY DO AT THE PARTICULAR DMV THAT'S CLOSE TO WHERE DAVE LIVES I REALLY DON'T WANT TO JUST SAY I 'M GREAT BECAUSE THAT KIND OF SOUNDS NARCISSISTIC AND THEN I WON 'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS
DavidLogan_2009 SAYING WE 'RE GREAT THAT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD BUT I SHOULD REALLY TALK STAGE FIVE RIGHT LIFE IS GREAT WELL IN FACT THERE ARE THREE SOMEWHAT COUNTER INTUITIVE FINDINGS THAT COME OUT OF ALL THIS THE FIRST ONE
DavidLogan_2009 STAGE FIVE RIGHT LIFE IS GREAT ORIENTED ONLY BY OUR VALUES NO OTHER GUIDANCE IN FACT MOST OF THE DOCUMENT IS WRITTEN AT STAGE TWO
DavidLogan_2009 MY LIFE SUCKS BECAUSE I LIVE UNDER A TYRANT ALSO KNOWN AS KING GEORGE WE'RE GREAT WHO IS NOT GREAT ENGLAND SORRY
DavidLogan_2009 HE DIDN'T SAY WE HAVE A DREAM HE SAID I HAVE A DREAM WHY DID HE DO THAT BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT AT STAGE FIVE TWO PERCENT ARE AT STAGE ONE
DavidLogan_2009 ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT ARE AT STAGE TWO SAYING IN EFFECT MY LIFE SUCKS FORTY EIGHT PERCENT OF WORKING TRIBES SAY
DavidLogan_2009 GET TO STAGE FIVE AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT CHANGE THE WORLD SO THE FIRST LITTLE FINDING FROM THIS IS THAT LEADERS NEED TO BE ABLE TO TALK ALL THE LEVELS SO THAT YOU CAN TOUCH EVERY PERSON IN SOCIETY
DavidLogan_2009 BUT YOU DON'T LEAVE THEM WHERE YOU FOUND THEM OKAY TRIBES CAN ONLY HEAR ONE LEVEL ABOVE AND BELOW WHERE THEY ARE SO WE HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO TALK ALL THE LEVELS TO GO TO WHERE THEY ARE AND THEN LEADERS NUDGE PEOPLE
DavidLogan_2009 AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE AND YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED HIS LIFE IT WAS WALKING INTO ONE OF THESE A BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB NOW HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED
DavidLogan_2009 TO THIS PERSON WHO EVENTUALLY BECAME MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO HE WENT FROM BEING ALIVE AND PASSIONATE AT STAGE ONE REMEMBER LIFE SUCKS DESPAIRING HOSTILITY I WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SURVIVE
DavidLogan_2009 TO WALKING INTO A BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB FOLDING HIS ARMS SITTING DOWN IN A CHAIR AND SAYING WOW MY LIFE REALLY SUCKS I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY I MEAN IF I WAS INTO BOXING LIKE
DavidLogan_2009 THEY WERE THEN MY LIFE WOULDN'T SUCK BUT I DON 'T SO IT DOES SO I'M GOING TO SIT HERE IN MY CHAIR AND NOT DO ANYTHING IN FACT THAT'S PROGRESS WE MOVE PEOPLE FROM STAGE ONE TO STAGE TWO BY GETTING THEM IN A NEW TRIBE AND THEN OVER TIME
DavidLogan_2009 THEN AT THE RECEPTION TONIGHT I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO SOMETHING BEYOND WHAT PEOPLE NORMALLY DO AND CALL NETWORKING
DavidLogan_2009 WHICH IS NOT JUST TO MEET NEW PEOPLE AND EXTEND YOUR REACH EXTEND YOUR INFLUENCE BUT INSTEAD FIND SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW AND FIND SOMEONE ELSE YOU DON'T KNOW AND INTRODUCE THEM
DavidLogan_2009 THAT'S CALLED A TRIADIC RELATIONSHIP SEE PEOPLE WHO BUILD WORLD CHANGING TRIBES DO THAT THEY EXTEND THE REACH OF THEIR TRIBES BY CONNECTING THEM NOT JUST TO MYSELF SO THAT MY FOLLOWING IS GREATER
DavidLogan_2009 BUT I CONNECT PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER TO SOMETHING GREATER THAN THEMSELVES AND ULTIMATELY THAT ADDS TO THEIR VALUES BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET BECAUSE THEN HOW DO WE GO FROM STAGE FOUR WHICH IS GREAT TO STAGE FIVE
DavidLogan_2009 THE STORY THAT I LIKE TO END WITH IS THIS IT COMES OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE GALLUP ORGANIZATION YOU KNOW THEY DO POLLS RIGHT SO IT'S STAGE FOUR WE'RE GREAT WHO IS NOT GREAT
DavidLogan_2009 SO THEY WERE BORED THEY WANTED TO CHANGE THE WORLD SO HERE IS THE QUESTION SOMEONE ASKED HOW COULD WE INSTEAD OF JUST POLLING WHAT ASIA
DavidLogan_2009 THINKS OR WHAT THE UNITED STATES THINKS OR WHO THINKS WHAT ABOUT OBAMA VERSUS MCCAIN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHAT DOES THE ENTIRE WORLD
DavidLogan_2009 AND THEY FOUND A WAY TO DO THE FIRST EVER WORLD POLL THEY HAD PEOPLE INVOLVED WHO WERE NOBEL LAUREATES IN ECONOMICS WHO REPORTED BEING BORED AND SUDDENLY THEY PULLED OUT SHEETS OF PAPER AND WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE SURVEY THE POPULATION OF SUB SAHARAN AFRICA
DavidLogan_2009 HOW DO WE SURVEY POPULATIONS THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AND SPEAK LANGUAGES WE DON'T SPEAK AND WE DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO SPEAKS THOSE LANGUAGES BECAUSE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ON THIS GREAT MISSION WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO IT INCIDENTALLY THEY DID PULL IT OFF
DavidLogan_2009 AND THEY RELEASED THE FIRST EVER WORLD POLL SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE THOUGHTS FIRST OF ALL WE ALL FORM TRIBES ALL OF US YOU'RE IN TRIBES HERE HOPEFULLY YOU'RE EXTENDING THE REACH OF THE TRIBES THAT YOU HAVE
DavidLogan_2009 BUT THE QUESTION ON THE TABLE IS THIS WHAT KIND OF AN IMPACT ARE THE TRIBES THAT YOU ARE
DavidLogan_2009 YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE A TRIBE ABOUT HOW THEY HAVE CHANGED THE WORLD IF YOU DO WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT YOU LISTEN FOR HOW PEOPLE ACTUALLY COMMUNICATE IN THE TRIBES THAT YOU'RE IN
DavidLogan_2009 AND YOU DON'T LEAVE THEM WHERE THEY ARE YOU NUDGE THEM FORWARD YOU REMEMBER TO TALK ALL FIVE CULTURE STAGES BECAUSE WE'VE GOT PEOPLE
DavidLogan_2009 IN ALL FIVE AROUND US AND THE QUESTION THAT I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS THIS WILL YOUR TRIBES CHANGE THE WORLD THANK YOU VERY MUCH
