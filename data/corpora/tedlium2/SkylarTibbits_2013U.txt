SkylarTibbits_2013U@17.79:21.1 THIS IS SLAVE LABOR TO MY OWN PROJECT
SkylarTibbits_2013U@21.21:27.18 THIS IS WHAT THE DIY AND MAKER MOVEMENTS REALLY LOOK LIKE
SkylarTibbits_2013U@27.28:34.41 AND THIS IS AN ANALOGY FOR TODAY 'S CONSTRUCTION AND MANUFACTURING WORLD WITH BRUTE FORCE ASSEMBLY TECHNIQUES
SkylarTibbits_2013U@34.74:41.22 AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I STARTED STUDYING HOW TO PROGRAM PHYSICAL MATERIALS TO BUILD THEMSELVES
SkylarTibbits_2013U@41.5:43.19 BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WORLD
SkylarTibbits_2013U@43.27:48.14 TODAY AT THE MICRO AND NANOSCALES THERE 'S AN UNPRECEDENTED REVOLUTION HAPPENING
SkylarTibbits_2013U@48.2:57.99 AND THIS IS THE ABILITY TO PROGRAM PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS TO CHANGE SHAPE CHANGE PROPERTIES AND EVEN COMPUTE OUTSIDE OF SILICON BASED MATTER
SkylarTibbits_2013U@58.17:69.91 THERE 'S EVEN A SOFTWARE CALLED CADNANO THAT ALLOWS US TO DESIGN THREE DIMENSIONAL SHAPES LIKE NANO ROBOTS OR DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND USE DNA TO SELF ASSEMBLE THOSE FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURES
SkylarTibbits_2013U@70.89:80.66 BUT IF WE LOOK AT THE HUMAN SCALE THERE 'S MASSIVE PROBLEMS THAT AREN 'T BEING ADDRESSED BY THOSE NANOSCALE TECHNOLOGIES IF WE LOOK AT CONSTRUCTION AND MANUFACTURING
SkylarTibbits_2013U@80.66:90.5 THERE 'S MAJOR INEFFICIENCIES ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND EXCESSIVE LABOR TECHNIQUES IN INFRASTRUCTURE LET 'S JUST TAKE ONE EXAMPLE TAKE PIPING
SkylarTibbits_2013U@90.5:107.01 IN WATER PIPES WE HAVE FIXED CAPACITY WATER PIPES THAT HAVE FIXED FLOW RATES EXCEPT FOR EXPENSIVE PUMPS AND VALVES WE BURY THEM IN THE GROUND IF ANYTHING CHANGES IF THE ENVIRONMENT CHANGES THE GROUND MOVES OR DEMAND CHANGES WE HAVE TO START FROM SCRATCH
SkylarTibbits_2013U@107.2:124.89 AND TAKE THEM OUT AND REPLACE THEM SO I 'D LIKE TO PROPOSE THAT WE CAN COMBINE THOSE TWO WORLDS THAT WE CAN COMBINE THE WORLD OF THE NANOSCALE PROGRAMMABLE ADAPTIVE MATERIALS AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND I DON 'T MEAN AUTOMATED MACHINES I DON 'T JUST MEAN SMART MACHINES THAT REPLACE HUMANS
SkylarTibbits_2013U@124.89:128.43 BUT I MEAN PROGRAMMABLE MATERIALS THAT BUILD THEMSELVES
SkylarTibbits_2013U@128.65:137.05 AND THAT 'S CALLED SELF ASSEMBLY WHICH IS A PROCESS BY WHICH DISORDERED PARTS BUILD AN ORDERED STRUCTURE THROUGH ONLY LOCAL INTERACTION
SkylarTibbits_2013U@137.05:155.34 SO WHAT DO WE NEED IF WE WANT TO DO THIS AT THE HUMAN SCALE WE NEED A FEW SIMPLE INGREDIENTS THE FIRST INGREDIENT IS MATERIALS AND GEOMETRY AND THAT NEEDS TO BE TIGHTLY COUPLED WITH THE ENERGY SOURCE AND YOU CAN USE PASSIVE ENERGY SO HEAT SHAKING PNEUMATICS GRAVITY MAGNETICS
SkylarTibbits_2013U@155.34:164.69 AND THEN YOU NEED SMARTLY DESIGNED INTERACTIONS AND THOSE INTERACTIONS ALLOW FOR ERROR CORRECTION AND THEY ALLOW THE SHAPES TO GO FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER STATE
SkylarTibbits_2013U@164.85:173.62 SO NOW I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT WE 'VE BUILT FROM ONE DIMENSIONAL TWO DIMENSIONAL THREE DIMENSIONAL AND EVEN FOUR DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS
SkylarTibbits_2013U@174.25:193.36 SO IN ONE DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS THIS IS A PROJECT CALLED THE SELF FOLDING PROTEINS AND THE IDEA IS THAT YOU TAKE THE THREE DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF A PROTEIN IN THIS CASE IT 'S THE CRAMBIN PROTEIN YOU TAKE THE BACKBONE SO NO CROSS LINKING NO ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTIONS AND YOU BREAK THAT DOWN INTO A SERIES OF COMPONENTS
SkylarTibbits_2013U@193.36:201.1 AND THEN WE EMBED ELASTIC AND WHEN I THROW THIS UP INTO THE AIR AND CATCH IT IT HAS THE FULL THREE DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE PROTEIN
SkylarTibbits_2013U@201.1:213.73 ALL OF THE INTRICACIES AND THIS GIVES US A TANGIBLE MODEL OF THE THREE DIMENSIONAL PROTEIN AND HOW IT FOLDS AND ALL OF THE INTRICACIES OF THE GEOMETRY SO WE CAN STUDY THIS AS A PHYSICAL INTUITIVE MODEL
SkylarTibbits_2013U@213.75:217.07 AND WE 'RE ALSO TRANSLATING THAT INTO TWO DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS
SkylarTibbits_2013U@217.07:233.8 SO FLAT SHEETS THAT CAN SELF FOLD INTO THREE DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURES IN THREE DIMENSIONS WE DID A PROJECT LAST YEAR AT TEDGLOBAL WITH AUTODESK AND ARTHUR OLSON WHERE WE LOOKED AT AUTONOMOUS PARTS SO INDIVIDUAL PARTS NOT PRE CONNECTED THAT CAN COME TOGETHER ON THEIR OWN
SkylarTibbits_2013U@233.88:243.6 AND WE BUILT FIVE HUNDRED OF THESE GLASS BEAKERS THEY HAD DIFFERENT MOLECULAR STRUCTURES INSIDE AND DIFFERENT COLORS THAT COULD BE MIXED AND MATCHED AND WE GAVE THEM AWAY TO ALL THE TEDSTERS
SkylarTibbits_2013U@243.6:263.33 AND SO THESE BECAME INTUITIVE MODELS TO UNDERSTAND HOW MOLECULAR SELF ASSEMBLY WORKS AT THE HUMAN SCALE THIS IS THE POLIO VIRUS YOU SHAKE IT HARD AND IT BREAKS APART AND THEN YOU SHAKE IT RANDOMLY AND IT STARTS TO ERROR CORRECT AND BUILT THE STRUCTURE ON ITS OWN AND THIS IS DEMONSTRATING THAT THROUGH RANDOM ENERGY WE CAN BUILD NON RANDOM SHAPES
SkylarTibbits_2013U@266.03:270.16 WE EVEN DEMONSTRATED THAT WE CAN DO THIS AT A MUCH LARGER SCALE LAST YEAR
SkylarTibbits_2013U@270.16:280.83 AT TED LONG BEACH WE BUILT AN INSTALLATION THAT BUILDS INSTALLATIONS THE IDEA WAS COULD WE SELF ASSEMBLE FURNITURE SCALE OBJECTS SO WE BUILT A LARGE ROTATING CHAMBER
SkylarTibbits_2013U@280.83:297.18 AND PEOPLE WOULD COME UP AND SPIN THE CHAMBER FASTER OR SLOWER ADDING ENERGY TO THE SYSTEM AND GETTING AN INTUITIVE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SELF ASSEMBLY WORKS AND HOW WE COULD USE THIS AS A MACROSCALE CONSTRUCTION OR MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUE FOR PRODUCTS SO REMEMBER I SAID FOUR D
SkylarTibbits_2013U@297.18:304.17 SO TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME WE 'RE UNVEILING A NEW PROJECT WHICH IS A COLLABORATION WITH STRATASYS AND IT 'S CALLED FOUR D PRINTING
SkylarTibbits_2013U@304.26:311.24 THE IDEA BEHIND FOUR D PRINTING IS THAT YOU TAKE MULTI MATERIAL THREE D PRINTING SO YOU CAN DEPOSIT MULTIPLE MATERIALS
SkylarTibbits_2013U@311.24:328.1 AND YOU ADD A NEW CAPABILITY WHICH IS TRANSFORMATION THAT RIGHT OFF THE BED THE PARTS CAN TRANSFORM FROM ONE SHAPE TO ANOTHER SHAPE DIRECTLY ON THEIR OWN AND THIS IS LIKE ROBOTICS WITHOUT WIRES OR MOTORS SO YOU COMPLETELY PRINT THIS PART AND IT CAN TRANSFORM INTO SOMETHING ELSE
SkylarTibbits_2013U@328.85:333.53 WE ALSO WORKED WITH AUTODESK ON A SOFTWARE THEY 'RE DEVELOPING CALLED PROJECT CYBORG
SkylarTibbits_2013U@333.53:351.83 AND THIS ALLOWS US TO SIMULATE THIS SELF ASSEMBLY BEHAVIOR AND TRY TO OPTIMIZE WHICH PARTS ARE FOLDING WHEN BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WE CAN USE THIS SAME SOFTWARE FOR THE DESIGN OF NANOSCALE SELF ASSEMBLY SYSTEMS AND HUMAN SCALE SELF ASSEMBLY SYSTEMS THESE ARE PARTS BEING PRINTED WITH MULTI MATERIAL PROPERTIES
SkylarTibbits_2013U@373.76:387.46 AND WE THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT A PROGRAM AND TRANSFORMATION HAS BEEN EMBEDDED DIRECTLY INTO THE MATERIALS THEMSELVES AND IT ALSO MIGHT JUST BE THE MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUE THAT ALLOWS US TO PRODUCE MORE ADAPTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE FUTURE
SkylarTibbits_2013U@387.52:393.11 SO I KNOW YOU 'RE PROBABLY THINKING OKAY THAT 'S COOL BUT HOW DO WE USE ANY OF THIS STUFF FOR THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
SkylarTibbits_2013U@393.48:408.12 SO I 'VE STARTED A LAB AT MIT AND IT 'S CALLED THE SELF ASSEMBLY LAB AND WE 'RE DEDICATED TO TRYING TO DEVELOP PROGRAMMABLE MATERIALS FOR THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND WE THINK THERE 'S A FEW KEY SECTORS THAT HAVE FAIRLY NEAR TERM APPLICATIONS ONE OF THOSE IS IN EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS
SkylarTibbits_2013U@408.12:416.89 THESE ARE SCENARIOS WHERE IT 'S DIFFICULT TO BUILD OUR CURRENT CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES DON 'T WORK IT 'S TOO LARGE IT 'S TOO DANGEROUS IT 'S EXPENSIVE TOO MANY PARTS
SkylarTibbits_2013U@416.89:428.14 AND SPACE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT WE 'RE TRYING TO DESIGN NEW SCENARIOS FOR SPACE THAT HAVE FULLY RECONFIGURABLE AND SELF ASSEMBLY STRUCTURES THAT CAN GO FROM HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL SYSTEMS FROM ONE TO ANOTHER
SkylarTibbits_2013U@428.62:434.44 LET 'S GO BACK TO INFRASTRUCTURE IN INFRASTRUCTURE WE 'RE WORKING WITH A COMPANY OUT OF BOSTON CALLED GEOSYNTEC
SkylarTibbits_2013U@434.52:443.62 AND WE 'RE DEVELOPING A NEW PARADIGM FOR PIPING IMAGINE IF WATER PIPES COULD EXPAND OR CONTRACT TO CHANGE CAPACITY OR CHANGE FLOW RATE
SkylarTibbits_2013U@443.63:447.94 OR MAYBE EVEN UNDULATE LIKE PERISTALTICS TO MOVE THE WATER THEMSELVES
SkylarTibbits_2013U@448.03:454.4 SO THIS ISN 'T EXPENSIVE PUMPS OR VALVES THIS IS A COMPLETELY PROGRAMMABLE AND ADAPTIVE PIPE ON ITS OWN
SkylarTibbits_2013U@454.92:466.08 SO I WANT TO REMIND YOU TODAY OF THE HARSH REALITIES OF ASSEMBLY IN OUR WORLD THESE ARE COMPLEX THINGS BUILT WITH COMPLEX PARTS THAT COME TOGETHER IN COMPLEX WAYS
SkylarTibbits_2013U@466.08:482.3 SO I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOU FROM WHATEVER INDUSTRY YOU 'RE FROM TO JOIN US IN REINVENTING AND REIMAGINING THE WORLD HOW THINGS COME TOGETHER FROM THE NANOSCALE TO THE HUMAN SCALE SO THAT WE CAN GO FROM A WORLD LIKE THIS TO A WORLD THAT 'S MORE LIKE THIS
SkylarTibbits_2013U@484.84:494.61 THANK YOU
