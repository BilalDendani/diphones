MikeMatas_2011@16.57:24.6 PAST YEAR AND A HALF MY TEAM AT PUSH POP PRESS AND CHARLIE MELCHER AND MELCHER MEDIA HAVE BEEN WORKING ON CREATING THE FIRST FEATURE LENGTH INTERACTIVE BOOK
MikeMatas_2011@25.27:28.7 IT 'S CALLED OUR CHOICE AND THE AUTHOR IS AL GORE
MikeMatas_2011@28.99:35.28 IT 'S THE SEQUEL TO AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH AND IT EXPLORES ALL THE SOLUTIONS THAT WILL SOLVE THE CLIMATE CRISIS
MikeMatas_2011@36.33:38.71 THE BOOK STARTS LIKE THIS THIS IS THE COVER
MikeMatas_2011@40.09:45.01 AS THE GLOBE SPINS WE CAN SEE OUR LOCATION AND WE CAN OPEN THE BOOK
MikeMatas_2011@46.75:49.57 AND SWIPE THROUGH THE CHAPTERS TO BROWSE THE BOOK
MikeMatas_2011@51.77:54.12 OR WE CAN SCROLL THROUGH THE PAGES AT THE BOTTOM
MikeMatas_2011@55.34:59.81 AND IF WE WANTED TO ZOOM INTO A PAGE WE CAN JUST OPEN IT UP
MikeMatas_2011@60.36:66.53 AND ANYTHING YOU SEE IN THE BOOK YOU CAN PICK UP WITH TWO FINGERS AND LIFT OFF THE PAGE AND OPEN UP
MikeMatas_2011@67.82:70.89 AND IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK AND READ THE BOOK AGAIN
MikeMatas_2011@100.95:109.34 AND THROUGHOUT THE BOOK THERE 'S OVER AN HOUR OF DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE AND INTERACTIVE ANIMATIONS SO YOU CAN OPEN THIS ONE
MikeMatas_2011@127.3:140.05 ONE OF THE COOLEST THINGS IN THIS BOOK ARE THE INTERACTIVE INFOGRAPHICS THIS ONE SHOWS THE WIND POTENTIAL ALL AROUND THE UNITED STATES BUT INSTEAD OF JUST SHOWING US THE INFORMATION WE CAN TAKE OUR FINGER
MikeMatas_2011@140.05:148.72 AND EXPLORE AND SEE STATE BY STATE EXACTLY HOW MUCH WIND POTENTIAL THERE IS WE CAN DO THE SAME FOR GEOTHERMAL ENERGY
MikeMatas_2011@175.61:184.73 COMING FROM THE WINDMILL IS DIVERTED INTO THE BATTERY AND AS THE WIND STARTS DYING DOWN ANY EXCESS ENERGY WILL BE DIVERTED BACK INTO THE HOUSE THE LIGHTS NEVER
MikeMatas_2011@217.92:223.42 SO THAT 'S PUSH POP PRESS FIRST TITLE AL GORE 'S OUR CHOICE THANK YOU
