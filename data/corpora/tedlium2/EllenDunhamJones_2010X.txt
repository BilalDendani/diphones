EllenDunhamJones_2010X THE LAST FIFTY YEARS WE'VE BEEN BUILDING THE SUBURBS WITH A LOT OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE CONSEQUENCES
EllenDunhamJones_2010X AND JUST PRESENT A WHOLE BUNCH OF REALLY INTERESTING PROJECTS THAT I THINK GIVE US TREMENDOUS REASONS TO BE REALLY OPTIMISTIC THAT THE BIG DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT OF THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS IS GOING TO BE RETROFITTING
EllenDunhamJones_2010X AND IN THE PROCESS WHAT THAT ALLOWS US TO DO IS TO REDIRECT A LOT MORE OF OUR GROWTH BACK INTO EXISTING COMMUNITIES THAT COULD USE A BOOST AND HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X SO WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT I THINK THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF REASONS AND I'M JUST GOING TO NOT GET INTO DETAIL BUT MENTION A FEW JUST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CLIMATE CHANGE THE AVERAGE URBAN DWELLER IN THE U S
EllenDunhamJones_2010X HAS ABOUT ONE THIRD THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF THE AVERAGE SUBURBAN DWELLER
EllenDunhamJones_2010X MOSTLY BECAUSE SUBURBANITES DRIVE A LOT MORE AND LIVING IN DETACHED BUILDINGS YOU HAVE THAT MUCH MORE EXTERIOR SURFACE TO LEAK ENERGY OUT OF SO STRICTLY FROM A CLIMATE CHANGE PERSPECTIVE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X CITIES ARE ALREADY RELATIVELY GREEN THE BIG OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IS ACTUALLY IN URBANIZING THE SUBURBS
EllenDunhamJones_2010X ALL THAT DRIVING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING OUT IN THE SUBURBS WE HAVE DOUBLED THE AMOUNT OF MILES WE DRIVE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X IT'S INCREASED OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL DESPITE THE GAINS IN FUEL EFFICIENCY WE'RE JUST DRIVING SO MUCH MORE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO KEEP UP TECHNOLOGICALLY
EllenDunhamJones_2010X IS ANOTHER REASON TO CONSIDER RETROFITTING RESEARCHERS AT THE CDC AND OTHER PLACES HAVE INCREASINGLY BEEN LINKING SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS WITH SEDENTARY LIFESTYLES
EllenDunhamJones_2010X AND THOSE HAVE BEEN LINKED THEN WITH THE RATHER ALARMING GROWING RATES OF OBESITY SHOWN IN THESE MAPS HERE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X AND THAT OBESITY HAS ALSO BEEN TRIGGERING GREAT INCREASES IN HEART DISEASE AND DIABETES TO THE POINT WHERE A CHILD BORN TODAY HAS A ONE IN THREE CHANCE OF DEVELOPING DIABETES
EllenDunhamJones_2010X AND THAT RATE HAS BEEN ESCALATING AT THE SAME RATE AS CHILDREN NOT WALKING TO SCHOOL ANYMORE AGAIN BECAUSE OF OUR DEVELOPMENT
EllenDunhamJones_2010X FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS YOU KNOW THE CHEAP LAND OUT ON THE EDGE HAS HELPED GENERATIONS OF FAMILIES ENJOY THE AMERICAN DREAM
EllenDunhamJones_2010X BUT INCREASINGLY THE SAVINGS PROMISED BY DRIVE TIL YOU QUALIFY AFFORDABILITY WHICH IS BASICALLY OUR MODEL
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THOSE SAVINGS ARE WIPED OUT WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE TRANSPORTATION COSTS
EllenDunhamJones_2010X FOR INSTANCE HERE IN ATLANTA
EllenDunhamJones_2010X ABOUT HALF OF HOUSEHOLDS MAKE BETWEEN TWENTY THOUSAND AND FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR AND THEY ARE SPENDING TWENTY NINE PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING
EllenDunhamJones_2010X AND THIRTY TWO PERCENT ON TRANSPORTATION
EllenDunhamJones_2010X TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE FIGURES THAT'S BEFORE WE GOT UP TO THE FOUR BUCKS A GALLON YOU KNOW NONE OF US REALLY TEND TO DO THE MATH ON OUR TRANSPORTATION COSTS AND THEY'RE NOT GOING DOWN ANY TIME SOON
EllenDunhamJones_2010X WHETHER YOU LOVE SUBURBIA 'S LEAFY PRIVACY OR YOU HATE ITS SOULLESS COMMERCIAL STRIPS THERE ARE REASONS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO RETROFIT BUT IS IT PRACTICAL
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THINK IT IS JUNE WILLIAMSON AND I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING THIS TOPIC FOR OVER A DECADE AND WE'VE FOUND OVER EIGHTY VARIED PROJECTS BUT THAT THEY'RE REALLY ALL MARKET DRIVEN
EllenDunhamJones_2010X WHAT'S DRIVING THE MARKET IN PARTICULAR NUMBER ONE IS MAJOR DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS WE ALL TEND TO THINK OF SUBURBIA AS THIS VERY FAMILY FOCUSED PLACE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X AND THE MARKET RESEARCH CONSUMER RESEARCH ASKING THE BOOMERS AND GEN Y WHAT IT IS THEY WOULD LIKE WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THERE IS GOING TO BE A HUGE DEMAND AND WE'RE ALREADY SEEING IT FOR MORE URBAN LIFESTYLES WITHIN SUBURBIA
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THAT BASICALLY THE BOOMERS WANT TO BE ABLE TO AGE IN PLACE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X WHEN THE POSTWAR SUBURBS WERE FIRST BUILT OUT ON THE CHEAP LAND AWAY FROM DOWNTOWN IT MADE SENSE TO JUST BUILD SURFACE PARKING LOTS
EllenDunhamJones_2010X BUT THOSE SITES HAVE NOW BEEN LEAPFROGGED AND LEAPFROGGED AGAIN AS WE'VE JUST CONTINUED TO SPRAWL
EllenDunhamJones_2010X AND THEY NOW HAVE A RELATIVELY CENTRAL LOCATION
EllenDunhamJones_2010X IT NO LONGER MAKE SENSE THAT LAND IS MORE VALUABLE THAN JUST SURFACE PARKING LOTS
EllenDunhamJones_2010X NOW MAKES SENSE TO GO BACK IN BUILD A DECK AND BUILD
EllenDunhamJones_2010X ON THOSE SITES
EllenDunhamJones_2010X SO WHAT DO YOU DO WITH A DEAD MALL DEAD OFFICE PARK IT TURNS OUT
EllenDunhamJones_2010X ALL SORTS OF THINGS IN A SLOW ECONOMY LIKE OURS RE INHABITATION IS ONE OF THE MORE POPULAR STRATEGIES
EllenDunhamJones_2010X SO THIS HAPPENS TO BE A DEAD MALL IN ST LOUIS THAT'S BEEN RE INHABITED AS ART SPACE IT'S NOW HOME TO ARTIST STUDIOS THEATER GROUPS DANCE TROUPES
EllenDunhamJones_2010X WE ALSO FOUND A LOT OF EXAMPLES OF DEAD BIG BOX STORES THAT HAVE BEEN CONVERTED INTO ALL SORTS OF COMMUNITY SERVING USES AS WELL
EllenDunhamJones_2010X LOTS OF SCHOOLS LOTS OF CHURCHES AND LOTS OF LIBRARIES LIKE THIS ONE THIS WAS A LITTLE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X TORE UP SOME OF THE PARKING SPACES PUT IN BIOSWALES TO COLLECT AND CLEAN THE RUNOFF PUT IN A LOT MORE SIDEWALKS TO CONNECT TO THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND THEY'VE MADE WHAT
EllenDunhamJones_2010X JUST A STORE ALONG A COMMERCIAL STRIP INTO A COMMUNITY GATHERING SPACE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THIS ONE IS A LITTLE L SHAPED STRIP SHOPPING CENTER IN PHOENIX ARIZONA REALLY ALL THEY DID WAS THEY GAVE IT A FRESH COAT OF BRIGHT PAINT A GOURMET GROCERY AND THEY PUT UP A RESTAURANT IN THE OLD POST OFFICE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF FOOD TO TURN A PLACE AROUND AND MAKE IT A DESTINATION IT'S BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL THEY'VE NOW TAKEN OVER THE STRIP ACROSS THE STREET AND
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THE REAL ESTATE ADS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ALL VERY PROUDLY PROCLAIM WALKING DISTANCE TO LE GRANDE ORANGE BECAUSE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X IT PROVIDED ITS NEIGHBORHOOD WITH WHAT SOCIOLOGISTS LIKE TO CALL A THIRD PLACE IF HOME IS THE FIRST PLACE AND WORK IS THE SECOND PLACE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THE THIRD PLACE IS WHERE YOU GO TO HANG OUT AND BUILD COMMUNITY AND ESPECIALLY AS SUBURBIA IS BECOMING LESS CENTERED ON THE FAMILY
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THE FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS THERE'S A REAL HUNGER FOR MORE THIRD PLACES
EllenDunhamJones_2010X SO THE MOST DRAMATIC RETROFITS ARE REALLY THOSE IN THE NEXT CATEGORY THE NEXT STRATEGY REDEVELOPMENT NOW DURING THE BOOM
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THERE WERE SEVERAL REALLY DRAMATIC REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WHERE THE ORIGINAL BUILDING WAS SCRAPED TO THE GROUND AND THE WHOLE SITE WAS REBUILT AT SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER DENSITY A SORT OF COMPACT WALKABLE URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS
EllenDunhamJones_2010X ON TOP OF ITS PARKING LOTS SO THE BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO SHOWS THE SIMPLE SIXTIES STRIP SHOPPING CENTER AND THEN THE MAPS ABOVE THAT
EllenDunhamJones_2010X SHOW ITS GRADUAL TRANSFORMATION INTO A COMPACT MIXED USE NEW ENGLAND VILLAGE AND IT HAS PLANS NOW THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR
EllenDunhamJones_2010X IT TO CONNECT TO NEW RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS THE ARTERIALS AND OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE SO YOU KNOW SOMETIMES IT'S INCREMENTAL SOMETIMES IT'S ALL AT ONCE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THIS IS ANOTHER INFILL PROJECT ON THE PARKING LOTS THIS ONE OF AN OFFICE PARK OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON D C
EllenDunhamJones_2010X WHEN METRORAIL EXPANDED TRANSIT INTO THE SUBURBS AND OPENED A STATION NEARBY TO THIS SITE THE OWNERS DECIDED TO
EllenDunhamJones_2010X BUILD A NEW PARKING DECK AND THEN INSERT ON TOP OF THEIR SURFACE LOTS A NEW MAIN STREET SEVERAL APARTMENTS AND CONDO BUILDINGS
EllenDunhamJones_2010X TODAY THE TRANSIT THE MAIN STREET AND THE NEW HOUSING HAVE ALL BEEN BUILT EVENTUALLY I EXPECT THAT THE STREETS WILL PROBABLY EXTEND THROUGH A REDEVELOPMENT OF THE MALL
EllenDunhamJones_2010X SO HERE 'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN SORT OF SEE THE FUNKY NEW CONDO BUILDINGS IN BETWEEN THE OFFICE BUILDINGS AND THE PUBLIC SPACE AND THE NEW MAIN STREET
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THIS ONE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES BELMAR I THINK THEY REALLY BUILT AN ATTRACTIVE PLACE HERE AND HAVE JUST EMPLOYED ALL GREEN CONSTRUCTION THERE'S MASSIVE P V ARRAYS ON THE ROOFS AS WELL AS WIND TURBINES
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THIS WAS A VERY LARGE MALL ON A HUNDRED ACRE SUPERBLOCK IT'S NOW TWENTY TWO WALKABLE URBAN BLOCKS
EllenDunhamJones_2010X WITH PUBLIC STREETS TWO PUBLIC PARKS EIGHT BUS LINES AND A RANGE OF HOUSING TYPES AND SO IT'S REALLY GIVEN LAKEWOOD COLORADO THE DOWNTOWN THAT THIS PARTICULAR SUBURB NEVER HAD
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THAT'S REALLY HISTORY SO HERE IT IS AT PROJECTED BUILD OUT
EllenDunhamJones_2010X HERE 'S WHAT THE NEW MAIN STREET LOOKS LIKE IT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL AND IT'S HELPED TO PROMPT EIGHT OF THE THIRTEEN REGIONAL MALLS IN DENVER HAVE NOW OR ANNOUNCED PLANS TO
EllenDunhamJones_2010X PLOWING DOWN THE WHOLE CITY NO IT'S POCKETS OF WALKABILITY ON THE SITES OF UNDER PERFORMING PROPERTIES
EllenDunhamJones_2010X AND SO IT'S GIVING PEOPLE MORE CHOICES BUT IT'S NOT TAKING AWAY CHOICES BUT IT'S ALSO NOT REALLY ENOUGH TO JUST CREATE POCKETS OF WALKABILITY
EllenDunhamJones_2010X YOU WANT TO ALSO TRY TO GET MORE SYSTEMIC TRANSFORMATION WE NEED TO ALSO RETROFIT THE CORRIDORS THEMSELVES SO THIS IS ONE THAT HAS BEEN RETROFITTED IN CALIFORNIA
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THEY TOOK THE COMMERCIAL STRIP SHOWN ON THE BLACK AND WHITE IMAGES BELOW AND THEY BUILT A BOULEVARD THAT HAS BECOME THE MAIN STREET FOR THEIR TOWN AND IT TRANSFORMED FROM BEING AN UGLY UNSAFE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X TO BECOMING A BEAUTIFUL
EllenDunhamJones_2010X I COULD IMAGINE BEAUTIFUL HOUSING GOING UP ALONG THERE WITHOUT TEARING DOWN ANOTHER TREE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X SO THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT THINGS
EllenDunhamJones_2010X I'D LOVE TO SEE MORE CORRIDORS GETTING RETROFITTING
EllenDunhamJones_2010X BUT DENSIFICATION IS NOT GOING TO WORK EVERYWHERE SOMETIMES RE GREENING IS REALLY THE BETTER ANSWER
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THE CITY RESTORED THE SITE 'S ORIGINAL WETLANDS
EllenDunhamJones_2010X SO THEY'VE MANAGED TO BOTH RESTORE THE LOCAL ECOLOGY AND THE LOCAL ECONOMY AT THE SAME TIME
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THIS IS ANOTHER RE GREENING EXAMPLE IT ALSO MAKES SENSE IN VERY STRONG MARKETS THIS ONE IN SEATTLE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X IS ON THE SITE OF A MALL PARKING LOT ADJACENT TO A NEW TRANSIT STOP AND THE WAVY LINE IS A PATH ALONGSIDE A CREEK THAT HAS NOW BEEN DAYLIT
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THE CREEK HAD BEEN CULVERTED UNDER THE PARKING LOT BUT DAYLIGHTING OUR CREEKS REALLY IMPROVES THEIR WATER QUALITY AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO HABITAT
EllenDunhamJones_2010X FIRST GENERATION OF RETROFITS
EllenDunhamJones_2010X I THINK WE HAVE THREE CHALLENGES FOR THE FUTURE THE FIRST IS TO PLAN RETROFITTING MUCH MORE SYSTEMICALLY AT THE METROPOLITAN SCALE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TARGET WHICH AREAS REALLY SHOULD BE RE GREENED WHERE SHOULD WE BE REDEVELOPING AND WHERE SHOULD WE BE ENCOURAGING RE INHABITATION
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THESE SLIDES JUST SHOW TWO IMAGES FROM A LARGER PROJECT THAT LOOKED AT TRYING TO DO THAT FOR ATLANTA
EllenDunhamJones_2010X I LED A TEAM THAT WAS ASKED TO IMAGINE ATLANTA ONE HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW AND WE CHOSE TO TRY TO REVERSE SPRAWL THROUGH THREE SIMPLE MOVES EXPENSIVE BUT SIMPLE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X ONE IN A HUNDRED YEARS TRANSIT ON ALL MAJOR RAIL AND ROAD CORRIDORS TWO IN A HUNDRED YEARS THOUSAND FOOT BUFFERS ON ALL STREAM CORRIDORS IT'S A LITTLE EXTREME BUT WE'VE GOT A LITTLE WATER PROBLEM
EllenDunhamJones_2010X IN A HUNDRED YEARS SUBDIVISIONS THAT SIMPLY END UP TOO CLOSE TO WATER OR TOO FAR FROM TRANSIT WON 'T BE VIABLE AND SO WE'VE CREATED
EllenDunhamJones_2010X ECO ACRE TRANSFER TO TRANSFER DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS
EllenDunhamJones_2010X TO THE TRANSIT CORRIDORS AND ALLOW THE RE GREENING OF THOSE FORMER SUBDIVISIONS FOR FOOD AND ENERGY PRODUCTION
EllenDunhamJones_2010X SO THE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X SECOND CHALLENGE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X IS TO IMPROVE THE ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN QUALITY OF THE RETROFITS AND I CLOSE WITH THIS IMAGE OF DEMOCRACY IN ACTION
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THIS IS A PROTEST THAT'S HAPPENING ON A RETROFIT IN SILVER SPRING MARYLAND ON AN ASTROTURF TOWN GREEN
EllenDunhamJones_2010X ARE OFTEN ACCUSED OF BEING EXAMPLES OF FAUX DOWNTOWNS AND INSTANT URBANISM AND NOT WITHOUT REASON YOU DON'T GET MUCH MORE PHONY THAN AN ASTROTURF TOWN GREEN
EllenDunhamJones_2010X TO SAY THESE ARE VERY HYBRID PLACES THEY ARE NEW BUT TRYING TO LOOK OLD THEY HAVE URBAN STREETSCAPES BUT SUBURBAN PARKING RATIOS
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THEIR POPULATIONS ARE MORE DIVERSE THAN TYPICAL SUBURBIA BUT THEY'RE LESS DIVERSE THAN CITIES AND THEY
EllenDunhamJones_2010X PUBLIC PLACES BUT THAT ARE MANAGED BY PRIVATE COMPANIES AND JUST THE SURFACE APPEARANCE IS LIKE THE ASTROTURF HERE
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THEY MAKE ME WINCE SO YOU KNOW I MEAN I'M GLAD THAT THE URBANISM IS DOING ITS JOB THE FACT THAT A PROTEST IS HAPPENING
EllenDunhamJones_2010X REALLY DOES MEAN THAT THE LAYOUT OF THE BLOCKS THE STREETS AND BLOCKS THE PUTTING IN OF PUBLIC SPACE COMPROMISED AS IT MAY BE IS STILL A REALLY GREAT THING BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET THE ARCHITECTURE BETTER THE FINAL CHALLENGE IS FOR ALL OF YOU
EllenDunhamJones_2010X THINK THAT DOWNTOWNS SHOULD BE DYNAMIC AND WE EXPECT THAT BUT WE SEEM TO HAVE AN EXPECTATION THAT THE SUBURBS SHOULD FOREVER REMAIN FROZEN IN WHAT EVER ADOLESCENT FORM THEY WERE FIRST GIVEN BIRTH TO
EllenDunhamJones_2010X IT'S TIME TO LET THEM GROW UP SO I WANT YOU TO ALL SUPPORT THE ZONING CHANGES THE ROAD DIETS THE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AND THE RETROFITS THAT ARE COMING SOON TO A NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR YOU THANK YOU
