IvanKrastev_2012G@33.71:51.23 AND PLUS I 'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU ANY ANSWERS I 'M MUCH MORE TRYING TO ADD TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO QUESTION IS THIS VERY POPULAR HOPE THESE DAYS THAT TRANSPARENCY AND OPENNESS CAN RESTORE THE TRUST IN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS
IvanKrastev_2012G@51.23:60.33 THERE IS ONE MORE REASON FOR YOU TO BE SUSPICIOUS ABOUT ME YOU PEOPLE THE CHURCH OF TED ARE A VERY OPTIMISTIC COMMUNITY
IvanKrastev_2012G@65.91:70.71 AS YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD I 'M BULGARIAN AND ACCORDING TO THE SURVEYS
IvanKrastev_2012G@70.71:86.63 WE ARE MARKED THE MOST PESSIMISTIC PEOPLE IN THE WORLD LAUGHTER THE ECONOMIST MAGAZINE RECENTLY WROTE AN ARTICLE COVERING ONE OF THE RECENT STUDIES ON HAPPINESS AND THE TITLE WAS THE HAPPY THE UNHAPPY AND THE BULGARIANS
IvanKrastev_2012G@91.35:109.97 LET 'S GIVE YOU THE STORY AND THIS IS A RAINY ELECTION DAY IN A SMALL COUNTRY THAT CAN BE MY COUNTRY BUT COULD BE ALSO YOUR COUNTRY AND BECAUSE OF THE RAIN UNTIL FOUR O 'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON NOBODY WENT TO THE POLLING STATIONS BUT THEN THE RAIN STOPPED
IvanKrastev_2012G@109.97:129.33 PEOPLE WENT TO VOTE AND WHEN THE VOTES HAD BEEN COUNTED THREE FOURTHS OF THE PEOPLE HAVE VOTED WITH A BLANK BALLOT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE OPPOSITION THEY HAVE BEEN SIMPLY PARALYZED BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT
IvanKrastev_2012G@137.61:155.46 SO THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO HAVE THE ELECTIONS ONCE AGAIN AND THIS TIME EVEN A GREATER NUMBER EIGHTY THREE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE VOTED WITH BLANK BALLOTS BASICALLY THEY WENT TO THE BALLOT BOXES TO TELL THAT THEY HAVE NOBODY TO VOTE FOR
IvanKrastev_2012G@155.46:165.02 THIS IS THE OPENING OF A BEAUTIFUL NOVEL BY JOSE SARAMAGO CALLED SEEING BUT IN MY VIEW IT VERY WELL CAPTURES
IvanKrastev_2012G@165.03:168.72 PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WITH DEMOCRACY IN EUROPE THESE DAYS
IvanKrastev_2012G@168.72:182.79 ON ONE LEVEL NOBODY 'S QUESTIONING THAT DEMOCRACY IS THE BEST FORM OF GOVERNMENT DEMOCRACY IS THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN THE PROBLEM IS THAT MANY PEOPLE START TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT A GAME WORTH PLAYING
IvanKrastev_2012G@182.79:190.17 FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS POLITICAL SCIENTISTS HAVE OBSERVED THAT THERE IS A CONSTANT DECLINE
IvanKrastev_2012G@190.17:203.36 IN ELECTORAL TURNOUT AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LEAST INTERESTED TO VOTE ARE THE PEOPLE WHOM YOU EXPECT ARE GOING TO GAIN MOST OUT OF VOTING I MEAN THE UNEMPLOYED THE UNDER PRIVILEGED
IvanKrastev_2012G@213.63:229.83 WAS REALLY DESTROYED ACCORDING TO THE LATEST SURVEY BEING DONE BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION EIGHTY NINE PERCENT OF THE CITIZENS OF EUROPE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A GROWING GAP BETWEEN THE OPINION OF THE POLICY MAKERS AND THE OPINION OF THE PUBLIC
IvanKrastev_2012G@263.41:271.74 SO BASICALLY I WANT TO ASK WHAT WENT RIGHT AND WHAT WENT WRONG IN THESE FIFTY YEARS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DEMOCRACY
IvanKrastev_2012G@282.54:302.27 THE WAY WE 'RE LIVING AND DEEPENED OUR DEMOCRATIC EXPERIENCE AND THE FIRST WAS THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL REVOLUTION OF ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT AND ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY S WHICH PUT THE INDIVIDUAL AT THE CENTER OF POLITICS IT WAS THE HUMAN RIGHTS MOMENT BASICALLY THIS WAS ALSO A MAJOR OUTBREAK A CULTURE OF DISSENT A CULTURE OF
IvanKrastev_2012G@315.39:331.41 BUT AFTER THAT YOU HAVE THE MARKET REVOLUTION OF THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY S AND NEVERTHELESS THAT MANY PEOPLE ON THE LEFT TRY TO HATE IT THE TRUTH IS THAT IT WAS VERY MUCH THE MARKET REVOLUTION THAT SENT THE MESSAGE THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT KNOW BETTER AND YOU HAVE MORE CHOICE DRIVEN SOCIETIES
IvanKrastev_2012G@331.41:340.43 AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE THE END OF COMMUNISM THE END OF THE COLD WAR AND IT WAS THE BIRTH OF THE GLOBAL WORLD
IvanKrastev_2012G@359.87:367.97 WHICH TOTALLY CHANGED THE WAY WE UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE ARE MAKING DECISIONS SO THIS IS WHAT WENT RIGHT
IvanKrastev_2012G@367.97:373.84 BUT IF WE 'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT WENT WRONG WE 'RE GOING TO END UP WITH THE SAME FIVE REVOLUTIONS
IvanKrastev_2012G@382.7:389.29 THE VERY IDEA ALL THESE COLLECTIVE NOUNS THAT WE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT ABOUT NATION CLASS
IvanKrastev_2012G@389.29:406.37 FAMILY WE START TO LIKE DIVORCING IF WE 'RE MARRIED AT ALL ALL THIS WAS VERY MUCH UNDER ATTACK AND IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO ENGAGE PEOPLE IN POLITICS WHEN THEY BELIEVE THAT WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS WHERE THEY PERSONALLY STAND AND YOU
IvanKrastev_2012G@414.34:429.92 REMEMBER UNTIL THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY S THE SPREAD OF DEMOCRACY HAS ALWAYS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY THE DECLINE OF INEQUALITY THE MORE DEMOCRATIC OUR SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN THE MORE EQUAL THEY HAVE BEEN BECOMING
IvanKrastev_2012G@464.65:468.1 THEY NEEDED THE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY FEARED THEM
IvanKrastev_2012G@488.26:490.64 AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE INTERNET
IvanKrastev_2012G@501.4:520.65 YOU CAN STAY WITH THE POLITICAL COMMUNITY YOU BELONG TO AND IT 'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT LIKE YOU I KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE BEEN SPLENDIDLY SPEAKING ABOUT THE DIGITAL WORLD AND THE POSSIBILITY FOR COOPERATION BUT HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT THE DIGITAL WORLD HAS DONE TO AMERICAN POLITICS THESE DAYS
IvanKrastev_2012G@533.71:544.3 DON 'T TALK TO ME ABOUT IDEAS ANYMORE DON 'T TALK TO ME ABOUT POLICY PROGRAMS WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS BASICALLY TO MANIPULATE THE EMOTIONS OF THE PEOPLE
IvanKrastev_2012G@544.3:552.98 AND YOU HAVE THIS VERY STRONGLY TO THE EXTENT THAT EVEN IF YOU SEE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT REVOLUTIONS THESE DAYS THESE REVOLUTIONS ARE NOT
IvanKrastev_2012G@552.98:567.22 NAMED ANYMORE AROUND IDEOLOGIES OR IDEAS BEFORE REVOLUTIONS USED TO HAVE IDEOLOGICAL NAMES THEY COULD BE COMMUNIST THEY COULD BE LIBERAL THEY COULD BE FASCIST OR ISLAMIC NOW THE REVOLUTIONS ARE CALLED UNDER THE MEDIUM WHICH IS MOST USED
IvanKrastev_2012G@567.22:582.03 YOU HAVE FACEBOOK REVOLUTIONS TWITTER REVOLUTIONS THE CONTENT DOESN 'T MATTER ANYMORE THE PROBLEM IS THE MEDIA I 'M SAYING THIS BECAUSE ONE OF MY MAJOR POINTS IS WHAT WENT RIGHT IS ALSO WHAT WENT WRONG
IvanKrastev_2012G@582.03:597.55 AND WHEN WE 'RE NOW TRYING TO SEE HOW WE CAN CHANGE THE SITUATION WHEN BASICALLY WE 'RE TRYING TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT DEMOCRACY WE SHOULD KEEP THIS AMBIGUITY IN MIND BECAUSE PROBABLY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE LOVE MOST ARE GOING TO BE ALSO THE THINGS THAT CAN HURT US MOST
IvanKrastev_2012G@601.17:616.08 THAT THIS PUSH FOR TRANSPARENCY THIS KIND OF A COMBINATION BETWEEN ACTIVE CITIZENS NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND MUCH MORE TRANSPARENCY FRIENDLY LEGISLATION CAN RESTORE TRUST IN POLITICS
IvanKrastev_2012G@616.08:629.78 YOU BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU HAVE THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PEOPLE WHO ARE READY TO USE THIS IT CAN MAKE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE GOVERNMENTS TO LIE IT 'S GOING TO BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO STEAL AND PROBABLY EVEN GOING TO BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO KILL
IvanKrastev_2012G@629.78:635.24 THIS IS PROBABLY TRUE BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE ALSO VERY CLEAR
IvanKrastev_2012G@635.24:651.77 THAT NOW WHEN WE PUT THE TRANSPARENCY AT THE CENTER OF POLITICS WHERE THE MESSAGE IS IT 'S TRANSPARENCY STUPID TRANSPARENCY IS NOT ABOUT RESTORING TRUST IN INSTITUTIONS TRANSPARENCY IS POLITICS MANAGEMENT OF MISTRUST
IvanKrastev_2012G@651.77:656.4 WE ARE ASSUMING THAT OUR SOCIETIES ARE GOING TO BE BASED ON MISTRUST
IvanKrastev_2012G@656.4:668.61 AND BY THE WAY MISTRUST WAS ALWAYS VERY IMPORTANT FOR DEMOCRACY THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE CHECKS AND BALANCES THIS IS WHY BASICALLY YOU HAVE ALL THIS CREATIVE MISTRUST BETWEEN THE REPRESENTATIVES AND THOSE WHOM THEY REPRESENT
IvanKrastev_2012G@668.61:680.24 BUT WHEN POLITICS IS ONLY MANAGEMENT OF MISTRUST THEN I 'M VERY GLAD THAT ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR HAS BEEN MENTIONED NOW WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR IN REVERSE
IvanKrastev_2012G@680.24:686.58 IT 'S NOT GOING TO BE THE BIG BROTHER WATCHING YOU IT 'S GOING TO BE WE BEING THE BIG BROTHER WATCHING THE POLITICAL CLASS
IvanKrastev_2012G@686.58:703.05 BUT IS THIS THE IDEA OF A FREE SOCIETY FOR EXAMPLE CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT DECENT CIVIC TALENTED PEOPLE ARE GOING TO RUN FOR OFFICE IF THEY REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT POLITICS IS ALSO ABOUT MANAGING MISTRUST
IvanKrastev_2012G@717.49:733.56 THEIR POSITIONS EVEN THE VERY WRONG POSITIONS BECAUSE CONSISTENCY IS GOING TO BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN COMMON SENSE AND THE AMERICANS WHO ARE IN THE ROOM ARE YOU NOT AFRAID THAT YOUR PRESIDENTS ARE GOING TO GOVERN ON THE BASIS OF WHAT THEY SAID IN THE PRIMARY ELECTIONS
IvanKrastev_2012G@760.59:763.98 TO LOOK ALSO AT THIS TYPE OF A STORY
IvanKrastev_2012G@805.09:812.28 BECAUSE IT 'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DISSENT KNOWING THAT TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THIS IS GOING TO BE ON THE PUBLIC SPACE
IvanKrastev_2012G@812.28:831.42 AND THIS IS IN A CERTAIN WAY GOING TO BE A POLITICAL CRISIS SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OPENNESS I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND IS THAT WHAT WENT RIGHT IS WHAT WENT WRONG AND THIS IS GOETHE WHO IS NEITHER BULGARIAN NOR A POLITICAL SCIENTIST SOME CENTURIES AGO HE SAID
IvanKrastev_2012G@831.42:835.88 THERE IS A BIG SHADOW WHERE THERE IS MUCH LIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
