JackChoi_2012 BUT FOR A SCHOOL IT COULD BE VERY DIFFICULT
JackChoi_2012 VIRTUAL DISSECTION TABLE
JackChoi_2012 THE DISSECTION WITHOUT A HUMAN CADAVER
JackChoi_2012 AND THE TABLE FORM IS IMPORTANT
JackChoi_2012 SO THIS IS EXACTLY THE WAY STUDENTS WILL SEE THE REAL ANATOMY
JackChoi_2012 AS YOU CAN SEE
JackChoi_2012 SO I CUT RIGHT HERE
JackChoi_2012 THEN IT 'S GOING TO SHOW INSIDE
JackChoi_2012 AND I CAN CHANGE MY CUT
JackChoi_2012 YOU CAN SEE SOME INTERNAL ORGANS
JackChoi_2012 SO WE CALL THIS THE SLICER MODE
JackChoi_2012 SO IF I WANT TO SEE THE BACK SIDE I CAN FLIP
JackChoi_2012 AND SEE FROM BEHIND
JackChoi_2012 UNCOMFORTABLE TO YOU OR DISTURBING TO YOU
JackChoi_2012 SO INSTEAD OF JUST BUTCHERING THE BODY I 'D LIKE TO DO MORE CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL DISSECTIONS WHAT I 'M GOING TO DO IS I 'M GOING TO PEEL OFF ALL THE SKIN MUSCLES AND BONES JUST TO SEE A FEW INTERNAL ORGANS
JackChoi_2012 YOU DON 'T WANT TO HEAR OOPS IN REAL SURGERY
JackChoi_2012 I 'M GOING TO MAKE A CUT RIGHT THERE
JackChoi_2012 SO LET ME SHOW YOU I 'M GOING TO START WITH THE SKELETAL STRUCTURE
JackChoi_2012 AND I CAN ADD A FEW INTERNAL ORGANS
JackChoi_2012 AND I CAN BUILD MUSCLES
JackChoi_2012 ANOTHER THING I CAN SHOW YOU
JackChoi_2012 AND ALSO IF YOU WANT YOU CAN COMPARE
JackChoi_2012 AND THEN IT 'S READY FOR ANOTHER SESSION
