FreemanDyson_2003 WILL WE BE REMEMBERED IN TWO HUNDRED YEARS I HAPPEN TO LIVE IN A LITTLE TOWN PRINCETON IN NEW JERSEY WHICH EVERY YEAR CELEBRATES THE GREAT EVENT IN PRINCETON HISTORY THE BATTLE OF PRINCETON
FreemanDyson_2003 WHICH WAS IN FACT A VERY IMPORTANT BATTLE IT WAS THE FIRST BATTLE THAT GEORGE WASHINGTON WON IN FACT AND WAS PRETTY MUCH OF A TURNING POINT IN THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE IT HAPPENED TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO
FreemanDyson_2003 IT WAS ACTUALLY A TERRIBLE DISASTER FOR PRINCETON THE TOWN WAS BURNED DOWN IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER
FreemanDyson_2003 AND IT WAS A VERY VERY SEVERE WINTER AND ABOUT A QUARTER OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN PRINCETON DIED THAT WINTER FROM HUNGER AND COLD
FreemanDyson_2003 BUT NOBODY REMEMBERS THAT WHAT THEY REMEMBER IS OF COURSE THE GREAT TRIUMPH THAT THE BRITS WERE BEATEN AND WE WON AND THAT THE COUNTRY WAS
FreemanDyson_2003 AND SO I AGREE VERY EMPHATICALLY THAT THE PAIN OF CHILDBIRTH IS NOT REMEMBERED IT'S THE CHILD THAT'S REMEMBERED AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH AT THIS TIME
FreemanDyson_2003 I WANTED TO JUST TALK FOR ONE MINUTE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY BECAUSE I THINK I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THAT I'M NOT A BIOLOGIST SO EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT IT CAN BE SAID IN ONE MINUTE
FreemanDyson_2003 WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT WE SHOULD FOLLOW THE MODEL THAT HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL WITH THE
FreemanDyson_2003 AS SOON AS COMPUTERS BECAME TOYS WHEN KIDS COULD COME HOME AND PLAY WITH THEM THEN THE INDUSTRY REALLY TOOK OFF AND THAT HAS TO HAPPEN WITH BIOTECH THERE'S A HUGE
FreemanDyson_2003 A HUGE COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
FreemanDyson_2003 WHO ARE PRACTICAL BIOLOGISTS WHO ARE DOG BREEDERS PIGEON BREEDERS
FreemanDyson_2003 PEOPLE WILL BE EMPOWERED WITH BIOTECH AND THAT WILL BE AN ENORMOUS
FreemanDyson_2003 POSITIVE STEP TO ACCEPTANCE
FreemanDyson_2003 OF BIOTECHNOLOGY THAT WILL BLOW AWAY A LOT OF THE OPPOSITION WHEN PEOPLE HAVE THIS TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR HANDS YOU HAVE A DO IT YOURSELF BIOTECH KIT GROW YOUR OWN
FreemanDyson_2003 JUST BUY THE SOFTWARE YOU DESIGN
FreemanDyson_2003 I WON 'T SAY ANYMORE YOU CAN TAKE IT ON FROM THERE IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND I THINK IT HAS TO HAPPEN
FreemanDyson_2003 THE TECHNOLOGY BECOMES NATURAL BECOMES PART OF THE HUMAN CONDITION SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY 'S FAMILIAR WITH AND EVERYBODY ACCEPTS SO
FreemanDyson_2003 LEAVE THAT ASIDE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT WHICH IS WHAT I KNOW ABOUT AND THAT IS ASTRONOMY AND I'M INTERESTED IN SEARCHING FOR LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE
FreemanDyson_2003 AND IT'S OPEN TO US TO INTRODUCE A NEW WAY OF DOING THAT AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL TALK ABOUT FOR TEN MINUTES OR WHATEVER THE TIME REMAINS
FreemanDyson_2003 THE IMPORTANT FACT IS THAT MOST OF THE REAL ESTATE THAT'S ACCESSIBLE TO US I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE STARS I'M TALKING ABOUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM THE STUFF THAT'S WITHIN REACH
FreemanDyson_2003 WITHIN REACH OF OUR EARTHBOUND TELESCOPES
FreemanDyson_2003 MOST OF THE REAL ESTATE IS VERY COLD AND VERY FAR FROM THE SUN
FreemanDyson_2003 IF YOU LOOK AT THE SOLAR SYSTEM AS WE KNOW IT TODAY IT HAS A FEW PLANETS CLOSE TO THE SUN THAT'S WHERE WE LIVE
FreemanDyson_2003 IT HAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF ASTEROIDS BETWEEN THE ORBIT OF THE EARTH OUT THROUGH TO
FreemanDyson_2003 THE ORBIT OF JUPITER THE ASTEROIDS ARE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF REAL ESTATE BUT NOT VERY LARGE AND IT'S NOT VERY PROMISING FOR LIFE SINCE MOST OF IT CONSISTS OF ROCK AND METAL MOSTLY ROCK
FreemanDyson_2003 IT'S NOT ONLY COLD BUT VERY DRY SO THE ASTEROIDS WE DON'T HAVE MUCH HOPE
FreemanDyson_2003 SOME INTERESTING PLACES A LITTLE FURTHER OUT THE MOONS OF JUPITER AND SATURN PARTICULARLY THERE'S A PLACE CALLED EUROPA WHICH IS EUROPA IS ONE OF THE MOONS OF JUPITER
FreemanDyson_2003 WHERE WE SEE A VERY LEVEL ICE SURFACE WHICH LOOKS AS IF IT'S FLOATING ON TOP OF AN OCEAN
FreemanDyson_2003 SO WE BELIEVE THAT ON EUROPA THERE IS IN FACT A DEEP OCEAN AND THAT MAKES IT EXTRAORDINARILY INTERESTING AS A PLACE TO EXPLORE
FreemanDyson_2003 PROBABLY THE MOST LIKELY PLACE FOR LIFE TO ORIGINATE JUST AS IT ORIGINATED ON THE EARTH
FreemanDyson_2003 SO
FreemanDyson_2003 WE WOULD LOVE TO EXPLORE EUROPA TO GO DOWN THROUGH THE ICE FIND OUT WHO IS SWIMMING AROUND IN THE OCEAN WHETHER THERE ARE FISH
FreemanDyson_2003 OR SEAWEED OR SEA MONSTERS WHATEVER THERE MAY BE THAT'S EXCITING OR CEPHALOPODS
FreemanDyson_2003 SO IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE AND VERY DIFFICULT TO GO DOWN THERE SEND DOWN YOUR SUBMARINE OR WHATEVER IT IS AND EXPLORE THAT'S SOMETHING WE DON'T YET KNOW HOW TO DO
FreemanDyson_2003 THERE ARE PLANS TO DO IT
FreemanDyson_2003 A BIT FURTHER YOU'LL FIND THAT BEYOND THE ORBIT OF NEPTUNE WAY OUT FAR FROM THE SUN THAT'S WHERE THE REAL ESTATE REALLY BEGINS YOU'LL FIND
FreemanDyson_2003 MILLIONS OR TRILLIONS OR BILLIONS OF OBJECTS WHICH IN WHAT WE CALL THE KUIPER BELT OR THE OORT CLOUD THESE
FreemanDyson_2003 CLOUDS OF SMALL OBJECTS WHICH APPEAR AS COMETS WHEN THEY FALL CLOSE TO THE SUN MOSTLY THEY JUST LIVE OUT THERE
FreemanDyson_2003 IN THE COLD OF THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM BUT THEY ARE BIOLOGICALLY VERY INTERESTING INDEED BECAUSE THEY CONSIST PRIMARILY OF ICE
FreemanDyson_2003 WITH OTHER MINERALS WHICH ARE JUST THE RIGHT ONES FOR DEVELOPING LIFE SO IF LIFE COULD BE ESTABLISHED OUT THERE IT WOULD HAVE ALL THE ESSENTIALS CHEMISTRY
FreemanDyson_2003 AND SUNLIGHT EVERYTHING THAT'S NEEDED
FreemanDyson_2003 SO WHAT I'M PROPOSING IS THAT THERE IS WHERE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR LIFE RATHER THAN ON MARS ALTHOUGH MARS IS OF COURSE ALSO A VERY PROMISING AND INTERESTING PLACE
FreemanDyson_2003 BUT WE CAN LOOK OUTSIDE VERY CHEAPLY AND IN A SIMPLE FASHION AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT
FreemanDyson_2003 THERE IS A IMAGINE
FreemanDyson_2003 OUT OF THE OCEAN ONTO THE SURFACE JUST AS IT DID ON THE EARTH STAYING IN THE OCEAN AND EVOLVING IN THE OCEAN FOR TWO BILLION YEARS FINALLY CAME OUT ONTO THE LAND AND THEN OF COURSE IT HAD GREAT MUCH GREATER FREEDOM
FreemanDyson_2003 AND A MUCH GREATER VARIETY OF CREATURES DEVELOPED ON THE LAND THAN HAD EVER BEEN POSSIBLE IN THE OCEAN AND THE STEP FROM THE OCEAN TO THE LAND WAS NOT EASY
FreemanDyson_2003 BUT IT HAPPENED
FreemanDyson_2003 NOW IF LIFE HAD ORIGINATED ON EUROPA IN THE OCEAN IT COULD ALSO HAVE MOVED OUT ONTO THE SURFACE THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY AIR THERE IT'S A VACUUM IT IS OUT
FreemanDyson_2003 IN THE COLD
FreemanDyson_2003 BUT IT STILL COULD HAVE COME YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THE PLANTS GROWING UP LIKE KELP THROUGH CRACKS IN THE ICE
FreemanDyson_2003 SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A REPTILIAN SKIN
FreemanDyson_2003 BUT BETTER WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT IS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO CONCENTRATE SUNLIGHT THE SUNLIGHT IN JUPITER ON THE SATELLITES OF JUPITER IS TWENTY FIVE TIMES FAINTER THAN IT IS HERE
FreemanDyson_2003 SINCE JUPITER IS FIVE TIMES AS FAR FROM THE SUN SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THESE CREATURES WHICH I CALL SUNFLOWERS WHICH I IMAGINE LIVING ON THE SURFACE OF EUROPA
FreemanDyson_2003 WOULD HAVE TO HAVE EITHER LENSES OR MIRRORS TO CONCENTRATE SUNLIGHT SO THEY COULD KEEP THEMSELVES WARM ON THE SURFACE
FreemanDyson_2003 BUT IF THEY JUST SIMPLY COULD GROW LIKE LEAVES LITTLE LENSES AND MIRRORS TO CONCENTRATE SUNLIGHT THEN THEY COULD KEEP WARM ON THE SURFACE THEY COULD ENJOY ALL THE BENEFITS OF THE SUNLIGHT
FreemanDyson_2003 AND HAVE ROOTS GOING DOWN INTO THE OCEAN LIFE THEN COULD FLOURISH MUCH MORE SO
FreemanDyson_2003 WHY NOT LOOK OF COURSE IT'S NOT VERY LIKELY THAT THERE'S LIFE ON THE SURFACE OF EUROPA NONE OF THESE THINGS IS LIKELY BUT MY
FreemanDyson_2003 MY PHILOSOPHY IS LOOK FOR WHAT'S DETECTABLE NOT FOR WHAT'S PROBABLE THERE'S A LONG HISTORY IN ASTRONOMY OF UNLIKELY THINGS TURNING OUT TO BE THERE
FreemanDyson_2003 AND I MEAN THE FINEST EXAMPLE OF THAT WAS RADIO ASTRONOMY AS A WHOLE THIS WAS ORIGINALLY WHEN RADIO ASTRONOMY BEGAN
FreemanDyson_2003 THE BELL LABS DETECTED RADIO WAVES COMING FROM THE SKY
FreemanDyson_2003 AND THE REGULAR ASTRONOMERS WERE SCORNFUL ABOUT THIS THEY SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT YOU CAN DETECT RADIO WAVES FROM THE SUN
FreemanDyson_2003 BUT THE SUN IS THE ONLY OBJECT IN THE UNIVERSE THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH AND BRIGHT ENOUGH ACTUALLY TO BE DETECTABLE YOU CAN EASILY CALCULATE THAT RADIO WAVES FROM THE SUN ARE FAIRLY FAINT
FreemanDyson_2003 AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE UNIVERSE IS MILLIONS OF TIMES FURTHER AWAY SO IT CERTAINLY WILL NOT BE DETECTABLE
FreemanDyson_2003 SO THERE'S NO POINT IN LOOKING AND THAT OF COURSE THAT SET BACK THE PROGRESS OF RADIO ASTRONOMY BY ABOUT TWENTY YEARS
FreemanDyson_2003 SINCE THERE WAS NOTHING THERE YOU MIGHT AS WELL NOT LOOK WELL OF COURSE AS SOON AS ANYBODY DID LOOK WHICH WAS AFTER ABOUT TWENTY YEARS WHEN RADIO ASTRONOMY REALLY TOOK OFF
FreemanDyson_2003 IT TURNED OUT THE UNIVERSE IS ABSOLUTELY FULL OF ALL KINDS OF WONDERFUL THINGS RADIATING IN THE RADIO SPECTRUM MUCH BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN
FreemanDyson_2003 SO THE SAME THING COULD BE TRUE FOR THIS KIND OF LIFE WHICH I'M TALKING ABOUT ON COLD OBJECTS THAT
FreemanDyson_2003 IT COULD IN FACT BE VERY ABUNDANT ALL OVER THE UNIVERSE AND IT'S NOT BEEN DETECTED JUST BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO LOOK SO THE LAST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS HOW TO DETECT IT
FreemanDyson_2003 CANADIAN EXPRESSION IF YOU HAPPEN TO WANT TO HUNT ANIMALS AT NIGHT YOU TAKE A MINER 'S LAMP WHICH IS A PIT LAMP
FreemanDyson_2003 YOU STRAP IT ONTO YOUR FOREHEAD SO YOU CAN SEE THE REFLECTION IN THE EYES OF THE ANIMAL SO IF YOU GO OUT AT NIGHT YOU SHINE A FLASHLIGHT
FreemanDyson_2003 THE ANIMALS ARE BRIGHT YOU SEE THE RED GLOW IN THEIR EYES WHICH IS THE REFLECTION OF THE FLASHLIGHT AND THEN IF YOU'RE ONE OF THESE UNSPORTING CHARACTERS
FreemanDyson_2003 YOU SHOOT THE ANIMALS AND TAKE THEM HOME AND OF COURSE THAT SPOILS THE GAME FOR THE OTHER HUNTERS WHO HUNT IN THE DAYTIME SO IN CANADA THAT'S
FreemanDyson_2003 THE RABBITS COMPETE WITH THE SHEEP IN NEW ZEALAND SO THE FARMERS GO OUT AT NIGHT WITH HEAVILY ARMED JEEPS
FreemanDyson_2003 AND SHINE THE HEADLIGHTS AND ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A SHEEP YOU SHOOT
FreemanDyson_2003 SO I HAVE PROPOSED TO APPLY THE SAME TRICK TO LOOKING FOR LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE THAT IF THESE CREATURES WHO ARE LIVING ON COLD SURFACES EITHER ON EUROPA
FreemanDyson_2003 FURTHER OUT ANYWHERE WHERE YOU CAN LIVE ON A COLD SURFACE THOSE CREATURES MUST BE PROVIDED WITH REFLECTORS
FreemanDyson_2003 IN ORDER TO CONCENTRATE SUNLIGHT THEY HAVE TO HAVE LENSES AND MIRRORS IN ORDER TO KEEP THEMSELVES WARM AND THEN WHEN YOU SHINE SUNLIGHT AT THEM
FreemanDyson_2003 THE SUNLIGHT WILL BE REFLECTED BACK JUST AS IT IS IN THE EYES OF AN ANIMAL
FreemanDyson_2003 SO THESE CREATURES WILL BE BRIGHT AGAINST THE COLD SURROUNDINGS AND THE FURTHER OUT YOU GO IN THIS AWAY FROM THE SUN THE MORE POWERFUL THIS REFLECTION WILL BE SO ACTUALLY THIS METHOD OF HUNTING FOR LIFE
FreemanDyson_2003 IN CONTRAST AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND SO AS YOU GO FURTHER AWAY FROM THE SUN THIS BECOMES MORE AND MORE POWERFUL
FreemanDyson_2003 SO IN FACT YOU CAN LOOK FOR THESE CREATURES WITH TELESCOPES FROM THE EARTH WHY AREN'T WE DOING IT SIMPLY BECAUSE NOBODY THOUGHT OF IT YET BUT I HOPE THAT
FreemanDyson_2003 WE SHALL LOOK AND WITH ANY WE PROBABLY WON 'T FIND ANYTHING NONE OF THESE SPECULATIONS MAY HAVE ANY BASIS IN FACT
FreemanDyson_2003 BUT STILL IT'S A GOOD CHANCE AND OF COURSE IF IT HAPPENS IT WILL TRANSFORM OUR VIEW OF LIFE ALTOGETHER BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT THE WAY LIFE CAN LIVE OUT THERE
FreemanDyson_2003 IT HAS ENORMOUS ADVANTAGES AS COMPARED WITH LIVING ON A PLANET IT'S EXTREMELY HARD TO MOVE FROM ONE PLANET TO ANOTHER WE'RE HAVING GREAT DIFFICULTIES AT THE MOMENT AND
FreemanDyson_2003 ANY CREATURES THAT LIVE ON A PLANET ARE PRETTY WELL STUCK ESPECIALLY IF YOU BREATH AIR IT'S VERY HARD TO GET FROM PLANET A TO PLANET B BECAUSE THERE'S NO AIR IN BETWEEN BUT IF YOU BREATHE
FreemanDyson_2003 DEAD
FreemanDyson_2003 AS YOU'RE OFF THE PLANET UNLESS YOU HAVE A SPACE SHIP BUT IF YOU LIVE IN A VACUUM IF YOU LIVE ON THE SURFACE OF ONE OF THESE OBJECTS SAY IN THE KUIPER BELT
FreemanDyson_2003 THIS AN OBJECT LIKE PLUTO OR ONE OF THE SMALLER OBJECTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF PLUTO
FreemanDyson_2003 AND YOU HAPPENED IF YOU'RE LIVING ON THE SURFACE THERE AND YOU GET KNOCKED OFF THE SURFACE BY A COLLISION THEN IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING ALL THAT MUCH YOU STILL ARE ON A PIECE OF ICE YOU CAN STILL HAVE SUNLIGHT AND YOU CAN STILL SURVIVE
FreemanDyson_2003 WHILE YOU'RE TRAVELING FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER AND THEN IF YOU RUN INTO ANOTHER OBJECT YOU CAN STAY THERE AND COLONIZE THE OTHER OBJECT
FreemanDyson_2003 SO LIFE WILL SPREAD THEN FROM ONE OBJECT TO ANOTHER SO IF IT EXISTS AT ALL IN THE KUIPER BELT IT'S LIKELY TO BE VERY WIDESPREAD AND YOU WILL HAVE THEN A GREAT
FreemanDyson_2003 WITHOUT HAVING TO WAIT FOR A COLLISION AND THERE'LL BE ADVANTAGES FOR SPREADING OUT LONG
FreemanDyson_2003 KELP LIKE FOREST OF VEGETATION I CALL THESE CREATURES SUNFLOWERS THEY LOOK LIKE MAYBE LIKE SUNFLOWERS THEY HAVE TO BE ALL THE TIME POINTING TOWARD THE SUN
FreemanDyson_2003 AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SPREAD OUT IN SPACE BECAUSE GRAVITY ON THESE OBJECTS IS WEAK SO THEY CAN COLLECT SUNLIGHT FROM A BIG AREA
FreemanDyson_2003 SO THEY WILL IN FACT BE QUITE EASY FOR US TO DETECT SO I HOPE IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS WE'LL FIND THESE CREATURES
FreemanDyson_2003 AND THEN OF COURSE OUR WHOLE VIEW OF LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE WILL CHANGE IF WE DON'T FIND THEM THEN WE CAN CREATE THEM OURSELVES
FreemanDyson_2003 THAT'S ANOTHER
FreemanDyson_2003 WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY THAT'S OPENING WE CAN AS SOON AS WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE UNDERSTANDING OF GENETIC ENGINEERING ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR
FreemanDyson_2003 TAKE IT HOME DO IT YOURSELF GENETIC ENGINEERING KIT IS TO DESIGN A CREATURE THAT CAN LIVE ON A COLD SATELLITE A PLACE LIKE EUROPA
FreemanDyson_2003 SO WE COULD COLONIZE EUROPA WITH OUR OWN CREATURES THAT WOULD BE A FUN THING TO DO
FreemanDyson_2003 IN THE LONG RUN OF COURSE IT WOULD ALSO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO MOVE OUT THERE
FreemanDyson_2003 WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE END IT'S NOT GOING TO BE JUST HUMANS COLONIZING SPACE IT'S GOING TO BE LIFE MOVING OUT FROM THE EARTH
FreemanDyson_2003 MOVING IT INTO ITS KINGDOM AND THE KINGDOM OF LIFE OF COURSE IS GOING TO BE THE UNIVERSE
FreemanDyson_2003 AND IF LIFE IS ALREADY THERE IT MAKES IT MUCH MORE EXCITING IN THE SHORT RUN BUT IN THE LONG RUN IF THERE'S NO LIFE THERE
FreemanDyson_2003 WE CREATE IT OURSELVES WE TRANSFORM THE UNIVERSE INTO SOMETHING MUCH MORE RICH AND BEAUTIFUL THAN IT IS TODAY
FreemanDyson_2003 SO AGAIN WE HAVE A BIG AND WONDERFUL FUTURE TO LOOK FORWARD THANK YOU
