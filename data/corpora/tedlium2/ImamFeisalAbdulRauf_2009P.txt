ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@27.04:34.85 THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS OTHERWISE OUR HOLY BOOK THE KORAN CONSISTS OF ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN CHAPTERS
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@39.38:44.86 THE SAYING OF IN THE NAME OF GOD THE ALL COMPASSIONATE THE ALL MERCIFUL
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@45:47.05 OR AS SIR RICHARD BURTON
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@47.12:50.06 NOT THE RICHARD BURTON WHO WAS MARRIED TO ELIZABETH TAYLOR
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@50.21:65.45 BUT THE SIR RICHARD BURTON WHO LIVED A CENTURY BEFORE THAT AND WHO WAS A WORLDWIDE TRAVELER AND TRANSLATOR OF MANY WORKS OF LITERATURE TRANSLATES IT IN THE NAME OF GOD THE COMPASSIONATING THE COMPASSIONATE
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@67:72.92 AND IN A SAYING OF THE KORAN WHICH TO MUSLIMS IS GOD SPEAKING TO HUMANITY
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@72.92:78.5 GOD SAYS TO HIS PROPHET MUHAMMAD WHOM WE BELIEVE TO BE THE LAST OF A SERIES OF
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@78.5:97.92 PROPHETS BEGINNING WITH ADAM INCLUDING NOAH INCLUDING MOSES INCLUDING ABRAHAM INCLUDING JESUS CHRIST AND ENDING WITH MUHAMMAD THAT WE HAVE NOT SENT YOU O MUHAMMAD EXCEPT AS A RAHMAH EXCEPT AS A SOURCE OF COMPASSION TO HUMANITY
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@102.01:117.67 WHOSE MISSION AND WHOSE PURPOSE IN FOLLOWING THE PATH OF THE PROPHET IS TO MAKE OURSELVES AS MUCH LIKE THE PROPHET AND THE PROPHET IN ONE OF HIS SAYINGS SAID ADORN YOURSELVES WITH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@117.67:123.81 AND BECAUSE GOD HIMSELF SAID THAT THE PRIMARY ATTRIBUTE OF HIS IS COMPASSION
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@124.43:139.99 IN FACT THE KORAN SAYS THAT GOD DECREED UPON HIMSELF COMPASSION OR REIGNED HIMSELF IN BY COMPASSION THEREFORE OUR OBJECTIVE AND OUR MISSION MUST BE TO BE SOURCES OF COMPASSION
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@140.49:150.45 ACTIVATORS OF COMPASSION ACTORS OF COMPASSION AND SPEAKERS OF COMPASSION AND DOERS OF COMPASSION THAT IS ALL WELL AND GOOD
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@150.76:163.47 BUT WHERE DO WE GO WRONG AND WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THE LACK OF COMPASSION IN THE WORLD FOR THE ANSWER TO THIS WE TURN TO OUR SPIRITUAL PATH
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@164.41:166.57 IN EVERY RELIGIOUS TRADITION
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@166.59:169.44 THERE IS THE OUTER PATH
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@176.42:194.8 THE ESOTERIC PATH OF ISLAM IS MORE POPULARLY KNOWN AS SUFISM OR TASAWWUF IN ARABIC AND THESE DOCTORS OR THESE MASTERS THESE SPIRITUAL MASTERS OF THE SUFI TRADITION REFER TO TEACHINGS AND EXAMPLES OF OUR PROPHET
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@199.74:211.07 IN ONE OF THE BATTLES THAT THE PROPHET WAGED HE TOLD HIS FOLLOWERS WE ARE RETURNING FROM THE LESSER WAR TO THE GREATER WAR TO THE GREATER BATTLE
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@227.9:235.98 THE SOURCES OF HUMAN PROBLEMS HAVE TO DO WITH EGOTISM I
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@237.25:243.27 THE FAMOUS SUFI MASTER RUMI WHO IS VERY WELL KNOWN TO MOST OF YOU
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@243.47:250.85 HAS A STORY IN WHICH HE TALKS OF A MAN WHO GOES TO THE HOUSE OF A FRIEND AND HE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@251.9:253.56 AND A VOICE ANSWERS
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@253.65:264.09 WHO 'S THERE IT 'S ME OR MORE GRAMMATICALLY CORRECTLY IT IS I AS WE MIGHT SAY IN ENGLISH THE VOICE SAYS GO AWAY
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@266.02:279.01 AFTER MANY YEARS OF TRAINING OF DISCIPLINING OF SEARCH AND STRUGGLE HE COMES BACK WITH MUCH GREATER HUMILITY HE KNOCKS AGAIN ON THE DOOR
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@279.76:288.72 THE VOICE ASKS WHO IS THERE HE SAID IT IS YOU O HEARTBREAKER THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@303.61:309.35 AND RUMI 'S STORIES ARE METAPHORS FOR THE SPIRITUAL PATH
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@310.4:313.67 IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD THERE IS
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@313.67:316.17 NO ROOM FOR MORE THAN ONE
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@316.94:319.03 AND THAT IS THE I OF DIVINITY
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@320.81:335 IN A TEACHING CALLED A HADITH QUDSI IN OUR TRADITION GOD SAYS THAT MY SERVANT OR MY CREATURE MY HUMAN CREATURE DOES NOT APPROACH ME BY ANYTHING
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@335.22:339.26 THAT IS DEARER TO ME THAN WHAT I HAVE ASKED THEM TO DO
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@340.65:343.87 AND THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE EMPLOYERS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@343.98:352.42 YOU WANT YOUR EMPLOYEES TO DO WHAT YOU ASK THEM TO DO AND IF THEY 'VE DONE THAT THEN THEY CAN DO EXTRA BUT DON 'T IGNORE WHAT YOU 'VE ASKED THEM TO DO
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@353.19:369.61 AND GOD SAYS MY SERVANT CONTINUES TO GET NEARER TO ME BY DOING MORE OF WHAT I 'VE ASKED THEM TO DO EXTRA CREDIT WE MIGHT CALL IT UNTIL I LOVE HIM OR LOVE HER AND WHEN I LOVE
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@369.61:377.11 MY SERVANT GOD SAYS I BECOME THE EYES BY WHICH HE OR SHE SEES
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@377.68:380.88 THE EARS BY WHICH HE OR SHE
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@391.43:393.73 WALKS AND THE HEART
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@393.86:399.02 BY WHICH HE OR SHE UNDERSTANDS IT IS THIS MERGING
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@409.56:414.79 MUSLIMS REGARD JESUS AS THE MASTER OF SUFISM
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@422.87:431.59 WHEN HE SAYS I AM THE SPIRIT AND I AM THE WAY AND WHEN THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD SAID WHOEVER HAS SEEN ME HAS SEEN GOD
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@432.31:436.26 IT IS BECAUSE THEY BECAME SO MUCH AN INSTRUMENT
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@436.73:446.92 OF GOD THEY BECAME PART OF GOD 'S TEAM SO THAT GOD 'S WILL WAS MANIFEST THROUGH THEM AND THEY WERE NOT ACTING FROM THEIR OWN SELVES AND THEIR OWN
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@454.17:462.11 ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TO GET OUR EGOS OUT OF THE WAY GET OUR EGOTISM OUT OF THE WAY
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@464.44:480.71 I 'M SURE PROBABLY ALL OF YOU HERE OR CERTAINLY THE VERY VAST MAJORITY OF YOU HAVE HAD WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE A MOMENT IN YOUR LIVES WHEN FOR A FEW SECONDS A MINUTE PERHAPS
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@487.71:495.44 AND AT THAT MINUTE YOU FELT AT ONE WITH THE UNIVERSE ONE
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@533.59:540.1 AND INSTEAD LIKE THE PERSON IN RUMI 'S STORY WE SAY OH THIS IS ALL YOU
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@541.69:543.21 THIS IS ALL YOU
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@543.77:545.62 AND THIS IS ALL US
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@551.48:559.35 O CREATOR O THE OBJECTIVE THE SOURCE OF OUR BEING AND THE END OF OUR JOURNEY
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@559.52:563.24 YOU ARE ALSO THE BREAKER OF OUR HEARTS
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@563.99:579.5 YOU ARE THE ONE WHOM WE SHOULD ALL BE TOWARDS FOR WHOSE PURPOSE WE LIVE AND FOR WHOSE PURPOSE WE SHALL DIE AND FOR WHOSE PURPOSE WE SHALL BE RESURRECTED AGAIN TO ACCOUNT
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@596.88:600.77 FOR THE KORAN ALWAYS URGES US
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@600.77:608.25 TO REMEMBER TO REMIND EACH OTHER BECAUSE THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@609.3:611.22 IS WITHIN EVERY HUMAN BEING
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@616.42:621.12 WE KNOW IT ALL WE HAVE ACCESS TO IT ALL JUNG MAY HAVE CALLED IT THE SUBCONSCIOUS
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@630.69:633.33 STATE OF SLEEP THE LESSER DEATH
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@649.44:661.07 AND WE SEE WONDERFUL THINGS WE TRAVEL BEYOND THE LIMITATIONS OF SPACE AS WE KNOW IT AND BEYOND THE LIMITATIONS OF TIME AS WE KNOW IT
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@668.44:670.09 THE NAME OF THE CREATOR
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@671.48:675.88 WHOSE PRIMARY NAME IS THE COMPASSIONATING THE COMPASSIONATE
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@686.72:688.96 THROUGH WHICH YOU NAME OR ACCESS
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@689.2:691.03 THE PRESENCE OF DIVINITY
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@701.5:708.56 AND ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM WHAT HINDUS CALL SATCHIDANANDA THE LANGUAGE DIFFERS
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@710.85:712.58 BUT THE OBJECTIVE IS THE SAME
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@742.17:748.09 REALITY IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THERE 'S ONLY ONE ABSOLUTE REALITY BY DEFINITION
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@749.84:755.89 ONE ABSOLUTE BEING BY DEFINITION BECAUSE ABSOLUTE IS BY DEFINITION SINGLE
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@756.17:758.26 AND ABSOLUTE AND SINGULAR
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@779.83:785.99 AND THESE SHOULD ALSO BE THE PRIMARY ATTRIBUTES OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@788.33:792.9 FOR WHAT DEFINES HUMANITY PERHAPS BIOLOGICALLY
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@793.65:795.27 IS OUR PHYSIOLOGY
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@796:799.71 BUT GOD DEFINES HUMANITY BY OUR
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@799.76:801.36 SPIRITUALITY
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@823.07:826.68 PROSTRATE NOT BEFORE THE HUMAN BODY
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@828.44:840.5 BUT BEFORE THE HUMAN SOUL WHY BECAUSE THE SOUL THE HUMAN SOUL EMBODIES A PIECE OF THE DIVINE BREATH
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@841.37:843.46 A PIECE OF THE DIVINE SOUL
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@845.4:851.8 THIS IS ALSO EXPRESSED IN BIBLICAL VOCABULARY WHEN WE ARE TAUGHT THAT WE WERE
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@851.8:854.56 CREATED IN THE DIVINE IMAGE
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@855.29:857.24 WHAT IS THE IMAGERY OF GOD
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@857.77:866.47 THE IMAGERY OF GOD IS ABSOLUTE BEING ABSOLUTE AWARENESS AND KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM AND ABSOLUTE COMPASSION
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@867.37:870.88 AND LOVE AND THEREFORE FOR US TO BE HUMAN
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@871.53:880.16 IN THE GREATEST SENSE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN IN THE MOST JOYFUL SENSE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN MEANS THAT WE TOO
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@881.56:883.73 HAVE TO BE PROPER STEWARDS
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@884.53:887.12 OF THE BREATH OF DIVINITY WITHIN US
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@888.34:893.48 AND SEEK TO PERFECT WITHIN OURSELVES THE ATTRIBUTE OF BEING
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@896.01:900.71 THE ATTRIBUTE OF WISDOM OF CONSCIOUSNESS OF AWARENESS
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@901.32:907.39 AND THE ATTRIBUTE OF BEING COMPASSIONATE AND LOVING BEINGS THIS
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@908.5:911.69 IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM MY FAITH TRADITION
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@912.29:918.07 AND THIS IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM MY STUDIES OF OTHER FAITH
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@918.99:921.83 AND THIS IS THE COMMON PLATFORM
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@922.18:929.41 ON WHICH WE MUST ALL STAND AND WHEN WE STAND ON THIS PLATFORM AS SUCH I AM CONVINCED
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@929.41:939.41 THAT WE CAN MAKE A WONDERFUL WORLD AND I BELIEVE PERSONALLY THAT WE 'RE ON THE VERGE
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@940.31:946.25 AND THAT WITH THE PRESENCE AND HELP OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU HERE WE CAN BRING ABOUT
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@948.12:950.02 THE PROPHECY OF ISAIAH
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@950.02:954.95 FOR HE FORETOLD OF A PERIOD WHEN
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@957.61:959.7 THEIR SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@961.07:967.04 AND WILL NOT LEARN WAR OR MAKE WAR ANYMORE
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@967.04:971.67 WE HAVE REACHED A STAGE IN HUMAN HISTORY THAT WE HAVE NO OPTION
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@981.87:989.8 CONTROL OUR EGOS WHETHER IT IS INDIVIDUAL EGO PERSONAL EGO FAMILY EGO NATIONAL EGO
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P@993.69:997.82 AND LET ALL BE FOR THE GLORIFICATION OF THE ONE
