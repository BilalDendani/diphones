ThomasCampbell_2012 CONSIDERING A CAREER IN THE ART WORLD
ThomasCampbell_2012 I TOOK A COURSE IN LONDON
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND ONE OF MY SUPERVISORS WAS THIS IRASCIBLE ITALIAN CALLED PIETRO
ThomasCampbell_2012 WHO DRANK TOO MUCH
ThomasCampbell_2012 BUT HE WAS A PASSIONATE TEACHER
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND I REMEMBER ONE OF OUR EARLIER CLASSES WITH HIM HE WAS PROJECTING IMAGES ON THE WALL ASKING US TO THINK ABOUT THEM
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND HE PUT UP AN IMAGE OF A PAINTING
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND HE SAID WHAT IS THIS
ThomasCampbell_2012 HE SAID IT 'S A WHAT
ThomasCampbell_2012 I SAID IT 'S A BACCHANAL BY TITIAN
ThomasCampbell_2012 AS I SAID HE SWORE TOO MUCH THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT LESSON FOR ME IN THAT PIETRO WAS SUSPICIOUS OF FORMAL ART TRAINING ART HISTORY TRAINING
ThomasCampbell_2012 BECAUSE HE FEARED THAT IT FILLED PEOPLE UP WITH JARGON
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND THEN THEY JUST CLASSIFIED THINGS RATHER THAN LOOKING AT THEM
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND HE WANTED TO REMIND US THAT ALL ART WAS ONCE CONTEMPORARY
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND HE WANTED US TO USE OUR EYES
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND HE WAS ESPECIALLY EVANGELICAL ABOUT THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE HE WAS LOSING HIS SIGHT
ThomasCampbell_2012 HE WANTED US TO LOOK AND ASK BASIC QUESTIONS OF OBJECTS WHAT IS IT HOW IS IT MADE WHY WAS IT MADE HOW IS IT USED
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND THESE WERE IMPORTANT LESSONS TO ME WHEN I SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME A PROFESSIONAL ART HISTORIAN
ThomasCampbell_2012 MY KIND OF EUREKA MOMENT CAME A FEW YEARS LATER
ThomasCampbell_2012 WHEN I WAS STUDYING THE ART OF THE COURTS OF NORTHERN EUROPE
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND OF COURSE IT WAS VERY MUCH DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF THE PAINTINGS AND THE SCULPTURES AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE DAY
ThomasCampbell_2012 BUT AS I BEGAN TO READ HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS AND CONTEMPORARY DESCRIPTIONS I FOUND THERE WAS A KIND OF A MISSING COMPONENT
ThomasCampbell_2012 FOR EVERYWHERE I CAME ACROSS DESCRIPTIONS OF TAPESTRIES
ThomasCampbell_2012 TAPESTRIES WERE UBIQUITOUS
ThomasCampbell_2012 BETWEEN THE MIDDLE AGES AND REALLY WELL INTO THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND IT WAS PRETTY APPARENT WHY
ThomasCampbell_2012 TAPESTRIES WERE PORTABLE
ThomasCampbell_2012 YOU COULD ROLL THEM UP SEND THEM AHEAD OF YOU
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND IN THE TIME IT TOOK TO HANG THEM UP YOU COULD TRANSFORM A COLD DANK INTERIOR INTO A RICHLY COLORED SETTING
ThomasCampbell_2012 TAPESTRIES EFFECTIVELY PROVIDED A VAST CANVAS ON WHICH THE PATRONS OF THE DAY COULD DEPICT THE HEROES WITH WHOM THEY WANTED TO BE ASSOCIATED
ThomasCampbell_2012 OR EVEN THEMSELVES
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND IN ADDITION TO THAT
ThomasCampbell_2012 THEY REQUIRED SCORES OF HIGHLY SKILLED WEAVERS WORKING OVER EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME
ThomasCampbell_2012 WITH VERY EXPENSIVE MATERIALS THE WOOLS THE SILKS EVEN GOLD AND SILVER THREAD
ThomasCampbell_2012 SO ALL IN ALL IN AN AGE WHEN THE VISUAL IMAGE OF ANY KIND WAS RARE
ThomasCampbell_2012 TAPESTRIES WERE AN INCREDIBLY POTENT
ThomasCampbell_2012 FORM OF PROPAGANDA
ThomasCampbell_2012 BECAUSE I SAW THE MET AS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES WHERE I COULD ORGANIZE REALLY BIG EXHIBITIONS ABOUT THE SUBJECT I CARED SO PASSIONATELY ABOUT
ThomasCampbell_2012 GAVE ME THE GO AHEAD TO ORGANIZE AN EXHIBITION FOR TWO THOUSAND AND TWO
ThomasCampbell_2012 WE NORMALLY HAVE THESE VERY LONG LEAD IN TIMES
ThomasCampbell_2012 IT WASN 'T STRAIGHTFORWARD IT 'S NO LONGER A QUESTION OF CHUCKING A TAPESTRY
ThomasCampbell_2012 SHIPPED IN OVERSIZED FREIGHTERS
ThomasCampbell_2012 SOME OF THEM ARE SO BIG WE HAD TO GET THEM INTO THE MUSEUM WE HAD TO TAKE THEM UP THE GREAT STEPS AT THE FRONT
ThomasCampbell_2012 WE THOUGHT VERY HARD ABOUT HOW TO PRESENT THIS UNKNOWN SUBJECT TO A MODERN AUDIENCE
ThomasCampbell_2012 THE DARK COLORS TO SET OFF THE COLORS THAT REMAINED IN OBJECTS THAT WERE OFTEN FADED
ThomasCampbell_2012 THE PLACING OF LIGHTS TO BRING OUT THE SILK AND THE GOLD THREAD
ThomasCampbell_2012 THESE WERE BIG COMPLEX THINGS
ThomasCampbell_2012 THERE WAS A LOT OF SKEPTICISM ON THE OPENING NIGHT I OVERHEARD ONE OF THE SENIOR MEMBERS OF STAFF SAYING
ThomasCampbell_2012 THIS IS GOING TO BE A BOMB
ThomasCampbell_2012 HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
ThomasCampbell_2012 CAME TO SEE THE SHOW
ThomasCampbell_2012 THE EXHIBITION WAS DESIGNED TO BE AN EXPERIENCE AND TAPESTRIES ARE HARD TO REPRODUCE IN PHOTOGRAPHS
ThomasCampbell_2012 SO I WANT YOU TO USE YOUR IMAGINATIONS THINKING OF THESE WALL HIGH OBJECTS SOME OF THEM TEN METERS WIDE
ThomasCampbell_2012 DEPICTING LAVISH COURT SCENES WITH COURTIERS AND DANDIES WHO WOULD LOOK QUITE AT HOME IN THE PAGES OF THE FASHION PRESS TODAY
ThomasCampbell_2012 THICK WOODS WITH HUNTERS CRASHING THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH IN PURSUIT OF WILD BOARS AND DEER
ThomasCampbell_2012 VIOLENT BATTLES WITH SCENES OF FEAR AND HEROISM
ThomasCampbell_2012 I REMEMBER TAKING MY SON 'S SCHOOL CLASS HE WAS EIGHT AT THE TIME AND ALL THE LITTLE BOYS
ThomasCampbell_2012 THERE WAS A DOG POOPING IN THE FOREGROUND LAUGHTER KIND OF AN IN YOUR FACE JOKE BY THE ARTIST AND YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE THEM BUT IT BROUGHT IT ALIVE TO THEM I THINK THEY SUDDENLY
ThomasCampbell_2012 THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE THAT COULD ONLY BE CREATED IN A MUSEUM I 'D OPENED UP THE EYES OF MY AUDIENCE
ThomasCampbell_2012 HISTORIANS ARTISTS PRESS THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO THE BEAUTY OF THIS LOST MEDIUM
ThomasCampbell_2012 A FEW YEARS LATER I WAS INVITED TO BE THE DIRECTOR OF THE MUSEUM
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND AFTER I GOT OVER THAT
ThomasCampbell_2012 WHO ME THE TAPESTRY GEEK
ThomasCampbell_2012 I DON 'T WEAR A TIE I REALIZED THE FACT I BELIEVE PASSIONATELY IN THAT CURATED MUSEUM EXPERIENCE
ThomasCampbell_2012 WE LIVE IN AN AGE OF UBIQUITOUS INFORMATION AND SORT OF JUST ADD WATER EXPERTISE
ThomasCampbell_2012 BUT THERE 'S NOTHING THAT COMPARES WITH THE PRESENTATION OF SIGNIFICANT OBJECTS
ThomasCampbell_2012 IN A WELL TOLD NARRATIVE WHAT THE CURATOR DOES THE INTERPRETATION OF A COMPLEX ESOTERIC SUBJECT IN A WAY THAT RETAINS THE INTEGRITY OF THE SUBJECT THAT MAKES IT UNPACKS IT FOR A GENERAL AUDIENCE
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND THAT TO ME TODAY IS NOW THE CHALLENGE AND THE FUN OF MY JOB SUPPORTING THE VISION OF MY CURATORS
ThomasCampbell_2012 WHETHER IT 'S AN EXHIBITION OF SAMURAI SWORDS EARLY BYZANTINE ARTIFACTS RENAISSANCE PORTRAITS OR THE SHOW WE HEARD MENTIONED EARLIER
ThomasCampbell_2012 THAT WAS AN INTERESTING CASE IN THE LATE SPRING EARLY SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND AND TEN
ThomasCampbell_2012 SHORTLY AFTER MCQUEEN 'S SUICIDE
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND WE PROCEEDED TO DO SOMETHING AT THE MUSEUM I THINK WE 'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE
ThomasCampbell_2012 IT WASN 'T JUST YOUR STANDARD INSTALLATION
ThomasCampbell_2012 IN FACT WE RIPPED DOWN THE GALLERIES TO RECREATE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SETTINGS A RECREATION OF HIS FIRST STUDIO A HALL OF MIRRORS
ThomasCampbell_2012 A CURIOSITY BOX
ThomasCampbell_2012 A SUNKEN SHIP A BURNED OUT INTERIOR WITH VIDEOS AND SOUNDTRACKS THAT RANGED FROM OPERATIC ARIAS TO PIGS FORNICATING
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY SETTING THE COSTUMES
ThomasCampbell_2012 IT COULD HAVE BEEN A TRAIN WRECK
ThomasCampbell_2012 IT COULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE
ThomasCampbell_2012 SHOP WINDOWS ON FIFTH AVENUE AT CHRISTMAS
ThomasCampbell_2012 BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT ANDREW CONNECTED WITH THE MCQUEEN TEAM
ThomasCampbell_2012 HE WAS CHANNELING THE RAWNESS AND THE BRILLIANCE OF MCQUEEN AND THE SHOW WAS QUITE TRANSCENDANT AND IT BECAME A PHENOMENON IN ITS OWN RIGHT BY THE END OF THE SHOW WE HAD PEOPLE QUEUING FOR FOUR OR FIVE HOURS TO GET INTO THE SHOW
ThomasCampbell_2012 NOW I 'VE DESCRIBED TWO VERY IMMERSIVE EXHIBITIONS BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT COLLECTIONS INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS CAN ALSO HAVE THAT SAME POWER
ThomasCampbell_2012 THE MET WAS SET UP NOT AS A MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART BUT OF AN ENCYCLOPEDIC MUSEUM
ThomasCampbell_2012 TODAY ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS LATER
ThomasCampbell_2012 THAT VISION IS AS PRESCIENT AS EVER
ThomasCampbell_2012 BECAUSE OF COURSE WE LIVE IN A WORLD OF CRISIS OF CHALLENGE AND WE 'RE EXPOSED TO IT THROUGH THE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN NEWSREELS
ThomasCampbell_2012 IT 'S IN OUR GALLERIES
ThomasCampbell_2012 THAT WE CAN UNPACK THE CIVILIZATIONS THE CULTURES THAT WE 'RE SEEING THE CURRENT MANIFESTATION OF WHETHER IT 'S LIBYA
ThomasCampbell_2012 EGYPT SYRIA
ThomasCampbell_2012 IT 'S IN OUR GALLERIES THAT WE CAN EXPLAIN AND GIVE GREATER UNDERSTANDING I MEAN OUR NEW ISLAMIC GALLERIES ARE A CASE IN POINT
ThomasCampbell_2012 OPENED TEN YEARS ALMOST TO THE WEEK AFTER NINE ELEVEN
ThomasCampbell_2012 I THINK FOR MOST AMERICANS
ThomasCampbell_2012 KNOWLEDGE OF THE ISLAMIC WORLD WAS PRETTY SLIGHT BEFORE NINE ELEVEN AND THEN IT WAS THRUST UPON US
ThomasCampbell_2012 IN ONE OF AMERICA 'S DARKEST HOURS AND THE PERCEPTION WAS THROUGH THE POLARIZATION OF THAT TERRIBLE EVENT
ThomasCampbell_2012 NOW IN OUR GALLERIES WE SHOW FOURTEEN CENTURIES OF THE DEVELOPMENT
ThomasCampbell_2012 OF DIFFERENT ISLAMIC
ThomasCampbell_2012 CULTURES ACROSS A VAST GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND AGAIN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE COME TO SEE THESE GALLERIES SINCE THEY OPENED LAST OCTOBER
ThomasCampbell_2012 REPLACING THE MUSEUM
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND I THINK THOSE NUMBERS ARE A RESOUNDING REJECTION OF THAT NOTION
ThomasCampbell_2012 I MEAN DON 'T GET ME WRONG I 'M A HUGE ADVOCATE OF THE WEB
ThomasCampbell_2012 IT GIVES US A WAY OF REACHING OUT TO AUDIENCES AROUND THE GLOBE
ThomasCampbell_2012 BUT NOTHING REPLACES THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE OBJECT PRESENTED WITH PASSIONATE SCHOLARSHIP
ThomasCampbell_2012 BRINGING PEOPLE FACE TO FACE WITH OUR OBJECTS
ThomasCampbell_2012 IS A WAY OF BRINGING THEM FACE TO FACE WITH PEOPLE
ThomasCampbell_2012 ACROSS TIME ACROSS SPACE WHOSE LIVES MAY HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT TO OUR OWN
ThomasCampbell_2012 FRUSTRATIONS AND ACHIEVEMENTS IN THEIR LIVES
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND I THINK THIS IS A PROCESS THAT HELPS US BETTER UNDERSTAND OURSELVES
ThomasCampbell_2012 HELPS US MAKE BETTER DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE WE 'RE GOING
ThomasCampbell_2012 THE GREAT HALL AT THE MET IS ONE OF THE GREAT PORTALS OF THE WORLD
ThomasCampbell_2012 FROM THERE YOU CAN WALK IN ANY DIRECTION
ThomasCampbell_2012 TO ALMOST ANY CULTURE
ThomasCampbell_2012 I FREQUENTLY GO OUT INTO THE HALL AND THE GALLERIES AND I WATCH OUR VISITORS COMING IN
ThomasCampbell_2012 OTHERS ARE VERY UNEASY IT 'S AN INTIMIDATING PLACE
ThomasCampbell_2012 THEY FEEL THAT THE INSTITUTION IS ELITIST
ThomasCampbell_2012 I WANT TO PUT PEOPLE IN A CONTEMPLATIVE FRAME OF MIND WHERE
ThomasCampbell_2012 THEY 'RE PREPARED TO BE
ThomasCampbell_2012 A LITTLE BIT LOST TO EXPLORE
ThomasCampbell_2012 TO SEE THE UNFAMILIAR IN THE FAMILIAR
ThomasCampbell_2012 BECAUSE FOR US IT 'S ALL ABOUT BRINGING THEM
ThomasCampbell_2012 CAPTURING THEM AT THAT MOMENT OF DISCOMFORT
ThomasCampbell_2012 WHEN THE INCLINATION IS KIND OF TO REACH FOR YOUR IPHONE YOUR BLACKBERRY
ThomasCampbell_2012 BUT TO CREATE A ZONE WHERE THEIR CURIOSITY
ThomasCampbell_2012 OR A DOG POOPING IN THE CORNER OF A TAPESTRY
ThomasCampbell_2012 OR TO BRING IT BACK TO MY TUTOR PIETRO
ThomasCampbell_2012 THOSE DANCING FIGURES WHO ARE INDEED KNOCKING BACK THE WINE
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND THAT NUDE FIGURE IN THE LEFT FOREGROUND
ThomasCampbell_2012 OF YOUTHFUL SEXUALITY
ThomasCampbell_2012 IN THAT MOMENT
ThomasCampbell_2012 OUR SCHOLARSHIP CAN TELL YOU
ThomasCampbell_2012 THAT THIS IS A BACCHANAL
ThomasCampbell_2012 BUT IF WE 'RE DOING OUR JOB RIGHT
ThomasCampbell_2012 AND YOU 'VE CHECKED THE JARGON AT THE FRONT DOOR
