ThomasCampbell_2012@16.37:20.52 CONSIDERING A CAREER IN THE ART WORLD
ThomasCampbell_2012@20.62:22.95 I TOOK A COURSE IN LONDON
ThomasCampbell_2012@23.44:29.19 AND ONE OF MY SUPERVISORS WAS THIS IRASCIBLE ITALIAN CALLED PIETRO
ThomasCampbell_2012@29.8:32.15 WHO DRANK TOO MUCH
ThomasCampbell_2012@37.05:39.64 BUT HE WAS A PASSIONATE TEACHER
ThomasCampbell_2012@40.37:48.28 AND I REMEMBER ONE OF OUR EARLIER CLASSES WITH HIM HE WAS PROJECTING IMAGES ON THE WALL ASKING US TO THINK ABOUT THEM
ThomasCampbell_2012@48.94:51.44 AND HE PUT UP AN IMAGE OF A PAINTING
ThomasCampbell_2012@65.19:66.86 AND HE SAID WHAT IS THIS
ThomasCampbell_2012@82.37:83.98 HE SAID IT 'S A WHAT
ThomasCampbell_2012@85.08:87.99 I SAID IT 'S A BACCHANAL BY TITIAN
ThomasCampbell_2012@96.89:108.57 AS I SAID HE SWORE TOO MUCH THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT LESSON FOR ME IN THAT PIETRO WAS SUSPICIOUS OF FORMAL ART TRAINING ART HISTORY TRAINING
ThomasCampbell_2012@108.85:113.64 BECAUSE HE FEARED THAT IT FILLED PEOPLE UP WITH JARGON
ThomasCampbell_2012@113.75:118.69 AND THEN THEY JUST CLASSIFIED THINGS RATHER THAN LOOKING AT THEM
ThomasCampbell_2012@119.09:123.75 AND HE WANTED TO REMIND US THAT ALL ART WAS ONCE CONTEMPORARY
ThomasCampbell_2012@124:126.62 AND HE WANTED US TO USE OUR EYES
ThomasCampbell_2012@127.04:132.84 AND HE WAS ESPECIALLY EVANGELICAL ABOUT THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE HE WAS LOSING HIS SIGHT
ThomasCampbell_2012@133.12:142.51 HE WANTED US TO LOOK AND ASK BASIC QUESTIONS OF OBJECTS WHAT IS IT HOW IS IT MADE WHY WAS IT MADE HOW IS IT USED
ThomasCampbell_2012@143.58:148.32 AND THESE WERE IMPORTANT LESSONS TO ME WHEN I SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME A PROFESSIONAL ART HISTORIAN
ThomasCampbell_2012@149.39:153.77 MY KIND OF EUREKA MOMENT CAME A FEW YEARS LATER
ThomasCampbell_2012@153.92:158.77 WHEN I WAS STUDYING THE ART OF THE COURTS OF NORTHERN EUROPE
ThomasCampbell_2012@159.25:167.98 AND OF COURSE IT WAS VERY MUCH DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF THE PAINTINGS AND THE SCULPTURES AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE DAY
ThomasCampbell_2012@168.63:177.97 BUT AS I BEGAN TO READ HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS AND CONTEMPORARY DESCRIPTIONS I FOUND THERE WAS A KIND OF A MISSING COMPONENT
ThomasCampbell_2012@178.6:182.58 FOR EVERYWHERE I CAME ACROSS DESCRIPTIONS OF TAPESTRIES
ThomasCampbell_2012@183.44:185.84 TAPESTRIES WERE UBIQUITOUS
ThomasCampbell_2012@185.92:190.14 BETWEEN THE MIDDLE AGES AND REALLY WELL INTO THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
ThomasCampbell_2012@190.3:192.41 AND IT WAS PRETTY APPARENT WHY
ThomasCampbell_2012@192.79:194.45 TAPESTRIES WERE PORTABLE
ThomasCampbell_2012@194.59:197.29 YOU COULD ROLL THEM UP SEND THEM AHEAD OF YOU
ThomasCampbell_2012@197.44:205.36 AND IN THE TIME IT TOOK TO HANG THEM UP YOU COULD TRANSFORM A COLD DANK INTERIOR INTO A RICHLY COLORED SETTING
ThomasCampbell_2012@206.51:216.98 TAPESTRIES EFFECTIVELY PROVIDED A VAST CANVAS ON WHICH THE PATRONS OF THE DAY COULD DEPICT THE HEROES WITH WHOM THEY WANTED TO BE ASSOCIATED
ThomasCampbell_2012@217.39:219.08 OR EVEN THEMSELVES
ThomasCampbell_2012@219.59:221.51 AND IN ADDITION TO THAT
ThomasCampbell_2012@225.01:231.16 THEY REQUIRED SCORES OF HIGHLY SKILLED WEAVERS WORKING OVER EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME
ThomasCampbell_2012@231.43:237.36 WITH VERY EXPENSIVE MATERIALS THE WOOLS THE SILKS EVEN GOLD AND SILVER THREAD
ThomasCampbell_2012@238.58:244.86 SO ALL IN ALL IN AN AGE WHEN THE VISUAL IMAGE OF ANY KIND WAS RARE
ThomasCampbell_2012@245.36:248.75 TAPESTRIES WERE AN INCREDIBLY POTENT
ThomasCampbell_2012@248.75:250.42 FORM OF PROPAGANDA
ThomasCampbell_2012@260.94:272.08 BECAUSE I SAW THE MET AS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES WHERE I COULD ORGANIZE REALLY BIG EXHIBITIONS ABOUT THE SUBJECT I CARED SO PASSIONATELY ABOUT
ThomasCampbell_2012@277.44:282.51 GAVE ME THE GO AHEAD TO ORGANIZE AN EXHIBITION FOR TWO THOUSAND AND TWO
ThomasCampbell_2012@282.62:285.54 WE NORMALLY HAVE THESE VERY LONG LEAD IN TIMES
ThomasCampbell_2012@286.53:291.38 IT WASN 'T STRAIGHTFORWARD IT 'S NO LONGER A QUESTION OF CHUCKING A TAPESTRY
ThomasCampbell_2012@296.91:300.31 SHIPPED IN OVERSIZED FREIGHTERS
ThomasCampbell_2012@300.71:306.81 SOME OF THEM ARE SO BIG WE HAD TO GET THEM INTO THE MUSEUM WE HAD TO TAKE THEM UP THE GREAT STEPS AT THE FRONT
ThomasCampbell_2012@308.88:315.5 WE THOUGHT VERY HARD ABOUT HOW TO PRESENT THIS UNKNOWN SUBJECT TO A MODERN AUDIENCE
ThomasCampbell_2012@315.98:321.28 THE DARK COLORS TO SET OFF THE COLORS THAT REMAINED IN OBJECTS THAT WERE OFTEN FADED
ThomasCampbell_2012@322.12:326.1 THE PLACING OF LIGHTS TO BRING OUT THE SILK AND THE GOLD THREAD
ThomasCampbell_2012@335.53:338.32 THESE WERE BIG COMPLEX THINGS
ThomasCampbell_2012@350.03:356.71 THERE WAS A LOT OF SKEPTICISM ON THE OPENING NIGHT I OVERHEARD ONE OF THE SENIOR MEMBERS OF STAFF SAYING
ThomasCampbell_2012@357.38:359.39 THIS IS GOING TO BE A BOMB
ThomasCampbell_2012@364.44:366.7 HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
ThomasCampbell_2012@366.75:368.55 CAME TO SEE THE SHOW
ThomasCampbell_2012@369.81:377.39 THE EXHIBITION WAS DESIGNED TO BE AN EXPERIENCE AND TAPESTRIES ARE HARD TO REPRODUCE IN PHOTOGRAPHS
ThomasCampbell_2012@377.93:385.99 SO I WANT YOU TO USE YOUR IMAGINATIONS THINKING OF THESE WALL HIGH OBJECTS SOME OF THEM TEN METERS WIDE
ThomasCampbell_2012@386.34:395.51 DEPICTING LAVISH COURT SCENES WITH COURTIERS AND DANDIES WHO WOULD LOOK QUITE AT HOME IN THE PAGES OF THE FASHION PRESS TODAY
ThomasCampbell_2012@396.01:402.31 THICK WOODS WITH HUNTERS CRASHING THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH IN PURSUIT OF WILD BOARS AND DEER
ThomasCampbell_2012@403.04:407.73 VIOLENT BATTLES WITH SCENES OF FEAR AND HEROISM
ThomasCampbell_2012@408.91:414.66 I REMEMBER TAKING MY SON 'S SCHOOL CLASS HE WAS EIGHT AT THE TIME AND ALL THE LITTLE BOYS
ThomasCampbell_2012@421.63:434.29 THERE WAS A DOG POOPING IN THE FOREGROUND LAUGHTER KIND OF AN IN YOUR FACE JOKE BY THE ARTIST AND YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE THEM BUT IT BROUGHT IT ALIVE TO THEM I THINK THEY SUDDENLY
ThomasCampbell_2012@451.38:458.38 THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE THAT COULD ONLY BE CREATED IN A MUSEUM I 'D OPENED UP THE EYES OF MY AUDIENCE
ThomasCampbell_2012@458.74:465.17 HISTORIANS ARTISTS PRESS THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO THE BEAUTY OF THIS LOST MEDIUM
ThomasCampbell_2012@467.01:471.84 A FEW YEARS LATER I WAS INVITED TO BE THE DIRECTOR OF THE MUSEUM
ThomasCampbell_2012@472.33:474.21 AND AFTER I GOT OVER THAT
ThomasCampbell_2012@474.89:476.9 WHO ME THE TAPESTRY GEEK
ThomasCampbell_2012@477.16:488.12 I DON 'T WEAR A TIE I REALIZED THE FACT I BELIEVE PASSIONATELY IN THAT CURATED MUSEUM EXPERIENCE
ThomasCampbell_2012@488.15:495.37 WE LIVE IN AN AGE OF UBIQUITOUS INFORMATION AND SORT OF JUST ADD WATER EXPERTISE
ThomasCampbell_2012@495.56:501.55 BUT THERE 'S NOTHING THAT COMPARES WITH THE PRESENTATION OF SIGNIFICANT OBJECTS
ThomasCampbell_2012@501.55:518.49 IN A WELL TOLD NARRATIVE WHAT THE CURATOR DOES THE INTERPRETATION OF A COMPLEX ESOTERIC SUBJECT IN A WAY THAT RETAINS THE INTEGRITY OF THE SUBJECT THAT MAKES IT UNPACKS IT FOR A GENERAL AUDIENCE
ThomasCampbell_2012@518.7:526.74 AND THAT TO ME TODAY IS NOW THE CHALLENGE AND THE FUN OF MY JOB SUPPORTING THE VISION OF MY CURATORS
ThomasCampbell_2012@526.81:538.74 WHETHER IT 'S AN EXHIBITION OF SAMURAI SWORDS EARLY BYZANTINE ARTIFACTS RENAISSANCE PORTRAITS OR THE SHOW WE HEARD MENTIONED EARLIER
ThomasCampbell_2012@544.79:550.95 THAT WAS AN INTERESTING CASE IN THE LATE SPRING EARLY SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND AND TEN
ThomasCampbell_2012@551.14:554.59 SHORTLY AFTER MCQUEEN 'S SUICIDE
ThomasCampbell_2012@593.33:598.09 AND WE PROCEEDED TO DO SOMETHING AT THE MUSEUM I THINK WE 'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE
ThomasCampbell_2012@598.12:601.14 IT WASN 'T JUST YOUR STANDARD INSTALLATION
ThomasCampbell_2012@601.35:612.95 IN FACT WE RIPPED DOWN THE GALLERIES TO RECREATE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SETTINGS A RECREATION OF HIS FIRST STUDIO A HALL OF MIRRORS
ThomasCampbell_2012@613.46:615.34 A CURIOSITY BOX
ThomasCampbell_2012@616.54:626.26 A SUNKEN SHIP A BURNED OUT INTERIOR WITH VIDEOS AND SOUNDTRACKS THAT RANGED FROM OPERATIC ARIAS TO PIGS FORNICATING
ThomasCampbell_2012@627.49:631.66 AND IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY SETTING THE COSTUMES
ThomasCampbell_2012@636.8:639.15 IT COULD HAVE BEEN A TRAIN WRECK
ThomasCampbell_2012@639.2:640.71 IT COULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE
ThomasCampbell_2012@641.18:644.86 SHOP WINDOWS ON FIFTH AVENUE AT CHRISTMAS
ThomasCampbell_2012@645.04:649.49 BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT ANDREW CONNECTED WITH THE MCQUEEN TEAM
ThomasCampbell_2012@649.64:666.19 HE WAS CHANNELING THE RAWNESS AND THE BRILLIANCE OF MCQUEEN AND THE SHOW WAS QUITE TRANSCENDANT AND IT BECAME A PHENOMENON IN ITS OWN RIGHT BY THE END OF THE SHOW WE HAD PEOPLE QUEUING FOR FOUR OR FIVE HOURS TO GET INTO THE SHOW
ThomasCampbell_2012@676.31:687.53 NOW I 'VE DESCRIBED TWO VERY IMMERSIVE EXHIBITIONS BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT COLLECTIONS INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS CAN ALSO HAVE THAT SAME POWER
ThomasCampbell_2012@688.03:696.1 THE MET WAS SET UP NOT AS A MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART BUT OF AN ENCYCLOPEDIC MUSEUM
ThomasCampbell_2012@696.23:698.69 TODAY ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS LATER
ThomasCampbell_2012@698.81:702.5 THAT VISION IS AS PRESCIENT AS EVER
ThomasCampbell_2012@702.6:711.96 BECAUSE OF COURSE WE LIVE IN A WORLD OF CRISIS OF CHALLENGE AND WE 'RE EXPOSED TO IT THROUGH THE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN NEWSREELS
ThomasCampbell_2012@712.25:714.23 IT 'S IN OUR GALLERIES
ThomasCampbell_2012@714.36:723.29 THAT WE CAN UNPACK THE CIVILIZATIONS THE CULTURES THAT WE 'RE SEEING THE CURRENT MANIFESTATION OF WHETHER IT 'S LIBYA
ThomasCampbell_2012@723.51:725.6 EGYPT SYRIA
ThomasCampbell_2012@725.78:733.54 IT 'S IN OUR GALLERIES THAT WE CAN EXPLAIN AND GIVE GREATER UNDERSTANDING I MEAN OUR NEW ISLAMIC GALLERIES ARE A CASE IN POINT
ThomasCampbell_2012@733.81:738.72 OPENED TEN YEARS ALMOST TO THE WEEK AFTER NINE ELEVEN
ThomasCampbell_2012@739.49:741.42 I THINK FOR MOST AMERICANS
ThomasCampbell_2012@741.52:748.48 KNOWLEDGE OF THE ISLAMIC WORLD WAS PRETTY SLIGHT BEFORE NINE ELEVEN AND THEN IT WAS THRUST UPON US
ThomasCampbell_2012@748.88:756.7 IN ONE OF AMERICA 'S DARKEST HOURS AND THE PERCEPTION WAS THROUGH THE POLARIZATION OF THAT TERRIBLE EVENT
ThomasCampbell_2012@757.69:763.39 NOW IN OUR GALLERIES WE SHOW FOURTEEN CENTURIES OF THE DEVELOPMENT
ThomasCampbell_2012@763.55:765.37 OF DIFFERENT ISLAMIC
ThomasCampbell_2012@765.38:768.79 CULTURES ACROSS A VAST GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD
ThomasCampbell_2012@769.5:777.41 AND AGAIN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE COME TO SEE THESE GALLERIES SINCE THEY OPENED LAST OCTOBER
ThomasCampbell_2012@783.14:785.11 REPLACING THE MUSEUM
ThomasCampbell_2012@785.25:790.95 AND I THINK THOSE NUMBERS ARE A RESOUNDING REJECTION OF THAT NOTION
ThomasCampbell_2012@791.15:795.58 I MEAN DON 'T GET ME WRONG I 'M A HUGE ADVOCATE OF THE WEB
ThomasCampbell_2012@796.2:800.65 IT GIVES US A WAY OF REACHING OUT TO AUDIENCES AROUND THE GLOBE
ThomasCampbell_2012@801.12:810.24 BUT NOTHING REPLACES THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE OBJECT PRESENTED WITH PASSIONATE SCHOLARSHIP
ThomasCampbell_2012@811.99:815.49 BRINGING PEOPLE FACE TO FACE WITH OUR OBJECTS
ThomasCampbell_2012@815.8:819.29 IS A WAY OF BRINGING THEM FACE TO FACE WITH PEOPLE
ThomasCampbell_2012@819.95:825.68 ACROSS TIME ACROSS SPACE WHOSE LIVES MAY HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT TO OUR OWN
ThomasCampbell_2012@830.82:834.78 FRUSTRATIONS AND ACHIEVEMENTS IN THEIR LIVES
ThomasCampbell_2012@834.91:839.75 AND I THINK THIS IS A PROCESS THAT HELPS US BETTER UNDERSTAND OURSELVES
ThomasCampbell_2012@840.15:843.88 HELPS US MAKE BETTER DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE WE 'RE GOING
ThomasCampbell_2012@846:851.21 THE GREAT HALL AT THE MET IS ONE OF THE GREAT PORTALS OF THE WORLD
ThomasCampbell_2012@855.19:857.55 FROM THERE YOU CAN WALK IN ANY DIRECTION
ThomasCampbell_2012@858.06:859.98 TO ALMOST ANY CULTURE
ThomasCampbell_2012@860.95:865.61 I FREQUENTLY GO OUT INTO THE HALL AND THE GALLERIES AND I WATCH OUR VISITORS COMING IN
ThomasCampbell_2012@872.94:877.43 OTHERS ARE VERY UNEASY IT 'S AN INTIMIDATING PLACE
ThomasCampbell_2012@877.58:880.48 THEY FEEL THAT THE INSTITUTION IS ELITIST
ThomasCampbell_2012@886.83:891.65 I WANT TO PUT PEOPLE IN A CONTEMPLATIVE FRAME OF MIND WHERE
ThomasCampbell_2012@892.21:893.89 THEY 'RE PREPARED TO BE
ThomasCampbell_2012@894.1:896.5 A LITTLE BIT LOST TO EXPLORE
ThomasCampbell_2012@897.53:900.37 TO SEE THE UNFAMILIAR IN THE FAMILIAR
ThomasCampbell_2012@905.1:908.02 BECAUSE FOR US IT 'S ALL ABOUT BRINGING THEM
ThomasCampbell_2012@912.9:916.46 CAPTURING THEM AT THAT MOMENT OF DISCOMFORT
ThomasCampbell_2012@917.68:921.81 WHEN THE INCLINATION IS KIND OF TO REACH FOR YOUR IPHONE YOUR BLACKBERRY
ThomasCampbell_2012@923.09:927.67 BUT TO CREATE A ZONE WHERE THEIR CURIOSITY
ThomasCampbell_2012@936.68:940.14 OR A DOG POOPING IN THE CORNER OF A TAPESTRY
ThomasCampbell_2012@940.89:944.03 OR TO BRING IT BACK TO MY TUTOR PIETRO
ThomasCampbell_2012@944.52:949.28 THOSE DANCING FIGURES WHO ARE INDEED KNOCKING BACK THE WINE
ThomasCampbell_2012@949.66:952.5 AND THAT NUDE FIGURE IN THE LEFT FOREGROUND
ThomasCampbell_2012@957.12:959.29 OF YOUTHFUL SEXUALITY
ThomasCampbell_2012@961.86:963.65 IN THAT MOMENT
ThomasCampbell_2012@964.24:966.78 OUR SCHOLARSHIP CAN TELL YOU
ThomasCampbell_2012@967.4:969.24 THAT THIS IS A BACCHANAL
ThomasCampbell_2012@970.69:972.7 BUT IF WE 'RE DOING OUR JOB RIGHT
ThomasCampbell_2012@973.38:976.3 AND YOU 'VE CHECKED THE JARGON AT THE FRONT DOOR
