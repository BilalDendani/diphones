JonathanKlein_2010U MY INDUSTRY WE BELIEVE THAT IMAGES CAN CHANGE THE WORLD OKAY WE'RE NAIVE WE'RE BRIGHT EYED AND BUSHY TAILED THE TRUTH IS THAT WE KNOW THAT THE IMAGES THEMSELVES DON'T CHANGE THE WORLD BUT WE'RE ALSO AWARE THAT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF PHOTOGRAPHY
JonathanKlein_2010U IMAGES HAVE PROVOKED REACTIONS IN PEOPLE AND THOSE REACTIONS HAVE CAUSED CHANGE TO HAPPEN SO LET 'S BEGIN WITH A GROUP OF IMAGES I'D BE EXTREMELY SURPRISED IF YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE MANY OR MOST OF THEM
JonathanKlein_2010U BEST DESCRIBED AS ICONIC SO ICONIC PERHAPS THEY'RE CLICHES IN FACT THEY'RE SO WELL KNOWN THAT YOU MIGHT EVEN RECOGNIZE THEM IN A SLIGHTLY OR SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT
JonathanKlein_2010U BUT I THINK WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE WE'RE LOOKING FOR IMAGES THAT SHINE AN UNCOMPROMISING LIGHT
JonathanKlein_2010U ON CRUCIAL ISSUES IMAGES THAT TRANSCEND BORDERS THAT TRANSCEND RELIGIONS IMAGES THAT PROVOKE US TO STEP UP AND DO SOMETHING IN OTHER WORDS TO ACT
JonathanKlein_2010U THIS IMAGE YOU'VE ALL SEEN IT CHANGED OUR VIEW OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD WE HAD NEVER SEEN OUR PLANET FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE BEFORE MANY PEOPLE CREDIT
JonathanKlein_2010U A LOT OF THE BIRTH OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT TO OUR SEEING THE PLANET LIKE THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME ITS SMALLNESS ITS FRAGILITY FORTY YEARS LATER
JonathanKlein_2010U THIS GROUP MORE THAN MOST ARE WELL AWARE OF THE DESTRUCTIVE POWER THAT OUR SPECIES CAN WIELD OVER OUR ENVIRONMENT AND AT LAST WE APPEAR TO BE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT
JonathanKlein_2010U THIS DESTRUCTIVE POWER TAKES MANY DIFFERENT FORMS FOR EXAMPLE THESE IMAGES TAKEN BY BRENT STIRTON IN THE CONGO THESE GORILLAS WERE MURDERED SOME WOULD EVEN SAY CRUCIFIED
JonathanKlein_2010U AND UNSURPRISINGLY THEY SPARKED INTERNATIONAL OUTRAGE MOST RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN TRAGICALLY REMINDED OF THE DESTRUCTIVE POWER OF NATURE ITSELF WITH THE RECENT EARTHQUAKE IN HAITI
JonathanKlein_2010U I THINK THAT IS FAR WORSE IS MAN 'S DESTRUCTIVE POWER OVER MAN SAMUEL PISAR AN AUSCHWITZ SURVIVOR SAID AND I'LL QUOTE HIM THE HOLOCAUST TEACHES US THAT NATURE
JonathanKlein_2010U EVEN IN ITS CRUELEST MOMENTS IS BENIGN IN COMPARISON WITH MAN WHEN HE LOSES HIS MORAL COMPASS AND HIS REASON
JonathanKlein_2010U THE PUBLICATION OF THOSE IMAGES AS OPPOSED TO THE IMAGES THEMSELVES CAUSED A GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE ITS POLICIES SOME WOULD ARGUE
JonathanKlein_2010U GO BACK A LITTLE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE VIETNAM WAR WAS BASICALLY SHOWN IN AMERICA 'S LIVING ROOMS DAY IN DAY OUT NEWS PHOTOS BROUGHT PEOPLE FACE TO FACE WITH THE VICTIMS OF THE WAR A LITTLE GIRL BURNED BY NAPALM
JonathanKlein_2010U A STUDENT KILLED BY THE NATIONAL GUARD AT KENT STATE UNIVERSITY IN OHIO DURING A PROTEST IN FACT THESE IMAGES BECAME THE VOICES OF PROTEST THEMSELVES
JonathanKlein_2010U HIV AIDS
JonathanKlein_2010U GREAT DEAL ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE TO STOP THAT SHE BETTER THAN MOST KNEW THE POWER OF AN IMAGE SO WHEN WE ARE CONFRONTED BY A POWERFUL IMAGE WE ALL HAVE A CHOICE
JonathanKlein_2010U THEY PUT A LOT OF FOCUS AND ATTENTION AND IN THE END A LOT OF MONEY TOWARDS THE SUDAN FAMINE RELIEF EFFORTS DID THE IMAGES CHANGE THE WORLD NO BUT THEY HAD A MAJOR IMPACT
JonathanKlein_2010U AND I THINK FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THEY HAD A VERY STRONG IMPACT AND I THINK IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT THEY WERE FAR FROM THE MINDS OF AMERICANS WHEN THEY WENT TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
JonathanKlein_2010U AND IT'S A PHOTO BY EUGENE RICHARDS OF AN IRAQ WAR VETERAN FROM AN EXTRAORDINARY PIECE OF WORK WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN PUBLISHED CALLED WAR IS PERSONAL
JonathanKlein_2010U IN ALL THE CONFLICT ZONES OF THE WORLD THERE'S ONE PHOTOGRAPH FROM A MUCH QUIETER PLACE THAT HAUNTS ME STILL MUCH MORE THAN THE OTHERS
JonathanKlein_2010U ANSEL ADAMS SAID AND I DISAGREE WITH HIM YOU DON'T TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH YOU MAKE IT IN MY VIEW IT'S NOT THE PHOTOGRAPHER WHO MAKES THE PHOTO IT'S YOU
JonathanKlein_2010U WE BRING TO EACH IMAGE OUR OWN VALUES OUR OWN BELIEF SYSTEMS AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THE IMAGE RESONATES WITH US MY COMPANY HAS SEVENTY MILLION IMAGES I HAVE ONE IMAGE IN MY OFFICE
JonathanKlein_2010U HERE IT IS
JonathanKlein_2010U I HOPE THAT THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE AN IMAGE THAT SPARKS SOMETHING IN YOU YOU'LL BETTER UNDERSTAND WHY AND I KNOW THAT SPEAKING TO THIS AUDIENCE YOU'LL DEFINITELY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE
