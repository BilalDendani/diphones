JillTarter_2009@22.82:32.46 ARE WE ALONE THE STORY OF HUMANS IS THE STORY OF IDEAS SCIENTIFIC IDEAS THAT SHINE LIGHT
JillTarter_2009@45.40:48.49 IN HISTORY AND IDEAS THAT HAVE BEEN SET IN DOGMA
JillTarter_2009@62.06:64.41 AND OF CONFLICTS AMONG THEM
JillTarter_2009@82.49:83.96 CARRIED OUT EVERY BOOK
JillTarter_2009@88.02:93.04 EVERY LAUGH EVERY TEAR THEY'VE ALL HAPPENED HERE
JillTarter_2009@95.62:99.31 HERE HERE
JillTarter_2009@109.29:111.00 IS A VERY POWERFUL THING
JillTarter_2009@112.22:116.05 PERSPECTIVES CAN CHANGE PERSPECTIVES CAN BE ALTERED
JillTarter_2009@135.60:145.41 QUESTIONS ABOUT NATURALISM AND TRANSCENDENCE ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHY WE ARE AND OF COURSE WHO ELSE MIGHT BE OUT THERE
JillTarter_2009@153.08:159.80 ARE WE ALONE IN THIS VAST UNIVERSE OF ENERGY AND MATTER AND CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS WELL
JillTarter_2009@161.62:163.14 IT'S AN AWFUL WASTE OF SPACE
JillTarter_2009@165.48:167.76 BUT WHAT IF WE'RE NOT WHAT
JillTarter_2009@168.82:169.85 THERE OTHERS ARE
JillTarter_2009@181.28:184.46 WOULD THE DISCOVERY OF AN OLDER
JillTarter_2009@190.03:190.25 US
JillTarter_2009@212.47:219.70 WE'RE BORN IN SAN FRANCISCO OR SUDAN OR CLOSE TO THE HEART OF THE MILKY WAY GALAXY WE ARE THE PRODUCTS OF
JillTarter_2009@220.34:227.10 BILLION YEAR LINEAGE OF WANDERING STAR DUST WE ALL OF US
JillTarter_2009@238.96:239.69 YEARS AGO
JillTarter_2009@240.66:243.02 THE JOURNEY TO FIND ANSWERS
JillTarter_2009@243.57:248.84 TOOK A DIFFERENT PATH AND SETI THE SEARCH FOR EXTRA TERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE BEGAN
JillTarter_2009@249.87:250.94 SO WHAT EXACTLY IS
JillTarter_2009@252.61:259.16 SETI USES THE TOOLS OF ASTRONOMY TO TRY AND FIND EVIDENCE OF SOMEONE ELSE'S TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE
JillTarter_2009@259.54:265.26 OUR OWN TECHNOLOGIES ARE VISIBLE OVER INTERSTELLAR DISTANCES AND THEIRS MIGHT BE AS WELL
JillTarter_2009@265.64:273.86 IT MIGHT BE THAT SOME MASSIVE NETWORK OF COMMUNICATIONS OR SOME SHIELD AGAINST ASTEROIDAL IMPACT OR SOME HUGE
JillTarter_2009@282.31:290.10 THAT A DETERMINED PROGRAM OF SEARCHING MIGHT DETECT FOR MILLENNIA WE'VE ACTUALLY TURNED TO THE PRIESTS AND THE PHILOSOPHERS
JillTarter_2009@290.57:299.68 FOR GUIDANCE AND INSTRUCTION ON THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE'S INTELLIGENT LIFE OUT THERE NOW WE CAN USE THE TOOLS OF THE TWENTY ONE ST CENTURY
JillTarter_2009@300.14:305.31 TO TRY AND OBSERVE WHAT IS RATHER THAN ASK WHAT SHOULD BE BELIEVED
JillTarter_2009@306.21:318.12 SETI DOESN'T PRESUME THE EXISTENCE OF EXTRA TERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE IT MERELY NOTES THE POSSIBILITY IF NOT THE PROBABILITY IN THIS VAST UNIVERSE
JillTarter_2009@318.83:324.71 THE NUMBERS SUGGEST A UNIVERSE OF POSSIBILITIES OUR SUN IS ONE
JillTarter_2009@325.34:333.61 OF FOUR HUNDRED BILLION STARS IN OUR GALAXY AND WE KNOW THAT MANY OTHER STARS HAVE PLANETARY SYSTEMS WE'VE DISCOVERED
JillTarter_2009@343.61:346.87 HAS A RADIUS JUST TWICE THE SIZE OF THE EARTH
JillTarter_2009@348.37:348.82 AND
JillTarter_2009@349.90:360.45 IF EVEN ALL OF THE PLANETARY SYSTEMS IN OUR GALAXY WERE DEVOID OF LIFE THERE'S STILL ONE HUNDRED BILLION OTHER GALAXIES OUT THERE ALTOGETHER TEN TO THE TWENTY TWO STARS
JillTarter_2009@372.43:376.39 ONE BILLION STARS NOW UP THERE TWENTY FEET ABOVE THE STAGE
JillTarter_2009@377.47:384.84 TEN TRILLION WELL WHAT ABOUT TEN TO THE TWENTY TWO WHERE'S THE LINE THAT MARKS THAT
JillTarter_2009@392.54:399.92 TIMES FARTHER AWAY THAN THE MOON OR FOUR PERCENT OF THE DISTANCE TO THE SUN SO THERE ARE MANY POSSIBILITIES
JillTarter_2009@402.61:411.49 AND MUCH OF THIS VAST UNIVERSE MUCH MORE MAY BE HABITABLE THAN WE ONCE THOUGHT AS WE STUDY EXTREMOPHILES ON EARTH ORGANISMS THAT CAN LIVE IN CONDITIONS
JillTarter_2009@412.03:417.61 TOTALLY INHOSPITABLE FOR US IN THE HOT HIGH PRESSURE
JillTarter_2009@418.30:423.86 THERMAL VENTS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN FROZEN IN ICE IN BOILING BATTERY
JillTarter_2009@447.22:455.26 TAKES A FULL EIGHT MINUTES FOR ITS RADIATION TO REACH US AND THE NEAREST STAR IS FOUR POINT TWO LIGHT YEARS AWAY WHICH MEANS ITS LIGHT TAKES FOUR POINT TWO
JillTarter_2009@469.58:470.39 A LONG TIME
JillTarter_2009@473.32:481.30 A SIGNAL WOULD GIVE US A GLIMPSE OF THEIR PAST NOT THEIR PRESENT WHICH IS WHY PHIL MORRISON CALLS SETI
JillTarter_2009@481.52:490.17 THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE FUTURE IT TELLS US ABOUT THEIR PAST BUT DETECTION OF A SIGNAL TELLS US IT'S POSSIBLE
JillTarter_2009@490.88:499.97 FOR US TO HAVE A LONG FUTURE I THINK THIS IS WHAT DAVID DEUTSCH MEANT IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE WHEN HE ENDED HIS OXFORD TEDTALK
JillTarter_2009@500.29:508.33 BY SAYING HE HAD TWO PRINCIPLES HE'D LIKE TO SHARE FOR LIVING AND HE WOULD LIKE TO CARVE THEM ON STONE TABLETS THE FIRST IS
JillTarter_2009@512.21:515.31 THE SECOND IS THAT PROBLEMS ARE SOLUBLE
JillTarter_2009@519.08:527.39 SO ULTIMATELY WHAT'S GOING TO DETERMINE THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF SETI IS THE LONGEVITY OF TECHNOLOGIES
JillTarter_2009@528.59:536.73 AND THE MEAN DISTANCE BETWEEN TECHNOLOGIES IN THE COSMOS DISTANCE OVER SPACE AND DISTANCE OVER TIME
JillTarter_2009@538.11:546.79 IF TECHNOLOGIES DON'T LAST AND PERSIST WE WILL NOT SUCCEED AND WE'RE A VERY YOUNG TECHNOLOGY IN AN OLD GALAXY
JillTarter_2009@554.73:563.75 UP UNTIL NOW I'VE BEEN TALKING TO YOU ABOUT REALLY LARGE NUMBERS LET ME TALK ABOUT A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER AND THAT'S THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE EARTH
JillTarter_2009@573.81:582.73 TAKEN FROM THE JACK HILLS OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA TELL US THAT WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED MILLION YEARS OF THE ORIGIN OF THE PLANET THERE WAS ABUNDANT WATER
JillTarter_2009@583.10:589.47 AND PERHAPS EVEN LIFE SO OUR PLANET HAS SPENT THE VAST MAJORITY OF
JillTarter_2009@595.29:600.10 LIFE NOT ANTICIPATING ITS EMERGENCE LIFE HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY AND THAT
JillTarter_2009@600.59:604.63 BODES WELL FOR THE POTENTIAL OF LIFE ELSEWHERE IN THE
JillTarter_2009@606.85:609.58 THE OTHER THING THAT ONE SHOULD TAKE AWAY FROM THIS CHART
JillTarter_2009@610.18:617.97 IS THE VERY NARROW RANGE OF TIME OVER WHICH HUMANS CAN CLAIM TO BE THE DOMINANT INTELLIGENCE ON THE PLANET
JillTarter_2009@642.38:642.82 THE
JillTarter_2009@650.51:654.77 WE ARE NOT THE DETERMINED PRODUCT OF
JillTarter_2009@655.41:660.41 BILLIONS OF YEARS OF EVOLUTIONARY PLOTTING AND PLANNING WE ARE
JillTarter_2009@661.25:663.39 ONE OUTCOME OF
JillTarter_2009@667.82:674.04 ARE RESIDENTS OF ONE SMALL PLANET IN A CORNER OF THE MILKY WAY GALAXY
JillTarter_2009@674.66:685.17 AND HOMO SAPIENS ARE ONE SMALL LEAF ON A VERY EXTENSIVE TREE OF LIFE THAT'S DENSELY POPULATED BY ORGANISMS
JillTarter_2009@689.91:697.76 MILLIONS OF YEARS WE MISUSE LANGUAGE AND TALK ABOUT THE ASCENT OF MAN
JillTarter_2009@698.08:705.34 WE UNDERSTAND THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR THE INTERRELATEDNESS OF LIFE BUT OUR EGO
JillTarter_2009@722.34:728.86 THAT ONE DOES NOT MEET ONESELF UNTIL ONE CATCHES THE REFLECTION FROM AN EYE OTHER THAN HUMAN
JillTarter_2009@729.88:742.16 ONE DAY THAT EYE MAY BE THAT OF AN INTELLIGENT ALIEN AND THE SOONER WE ESCHEW OUR NARROW VIEW OF EVOLUTION THE SOONER WE CAN
JillTarter_2009@750.18:751.79 ARE A SMALL PART
JillTarter_2009@757.93:759.08 WE ARE GOING TO BE
JillTarter_2009@790.37:800.42 THE EARTH OUT OF THE CENTER AND PUTTING THE SUN IN THE CENTER OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM HE OPENED OUR EYES TO A MUCH LARGER UNIVERSE
JillTarter_2009@800.78:811.62 OF WHICH WE ARE JUST A SMALL PART AND THAT COPERNICAN REVOLUTION CONTINUES TODAY TO INFLUENCE SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY AND TECHNOLOGY AND THEOLOGY
JillTarter_2009@827.15:838.01 CONDUCTED THE FIRST SETI OBSERVATION LOOKING AT TWO STARS TAU CETI AND EPSILON ERIDANI FOR ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOURS NOW DOCTORAKE DID NOT DISCOVER EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE
JillTarter_2009@838.49:848.53 BUT HE LEARNED A VERY VALUABLE LESSON FROM A PASSING AIRCRAFT AND THAT'S THAT TERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGY CAN INTERFERE WITH THE SEARCH FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGY
JillTarter_2009@874.84:888.27 BIGGER GLASSES MUCH BIGGER GLASSES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE'RE BEGINNING TO TAKE OBSERVATIONS WITH THE FIRST FORTY TWO TELESCOPES OF THE ALLEN TELESCOPE ARRAY AND I'VE GOT TO TAKE A MOMENT RIGHT
JillTarter_2009@891.02:900.23 PAUL ALLEN AND NATHAN MYHRVOLD AND ALL THE TEAMSETI MEMBERS IN THE TED COMMUNITY WHO HAVE SO GENEROUSLY SUPPORTED THIS RESEARCH
JillTarter_2009@909.98:917.08 IS THE FIRST TELESCOPE BUILT FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF SMALL DISHES AND HOOKED TOGETHER WITH COMPUTERS IT'S MAKING SILICON AS IMPORTANT AS ALUMINUM
JillTarter_2009@929.02:937.89 OUR SIGNAL DETECTION ALGORITHMS CAN FIND VERY SIMPLE ARTIFACTS AND NOISE IF YOU LOOK VERY HARD HERE YOU CAN SEE THE SIGNAL FROM
JillTarter_2009@938.59:949.15 VOYAGER ONE SPACECRAFT THE MOST DISTANT HUMAN OBJECT IN THE UNIVERSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIX TIMES AS FAR AWAY FROM US AS THE SUN IS AND
JillTarter_2009@949.64:959.15 OVER THOSE LONG DISTANCES ITS SIGNAL IS VERY FAINT WHEN IT REACHES US IT MAY BE HARD FOR YOUR EYE TO SEE IT BUT IT'S EASILY FOUND WITH OUR EFFICIENT ALGORITHMS
JillTarter_2009@959.36:967.06 BUT THIS IS A SIMPLE SIGNAL AND TOMORROW WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO FIND MORE COMPLEX SIGNALS THIS IS A VERY GOOD YEAR
JillTarter_2009@982.96:992.08 THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF SETI AS A SCIENCE THE TWENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INCORPORATION OF THE SETI INSTITUTE AS A NON PROFIT AND OF COURSE
JillTarter_2009@992.90:1002.43 THE TWENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF TED AND NEXT MONTH THE KEPLER SPACECRAFT WILL LAUNCH AND WILL BEGIN TO TELL US JUST HOW FREQUENT EARTH LIKE PLANETS ARE
JillTarter_2009@1013.81:1015.23 US RESIDENTS OF
JillTarter_2009@1017.01:1023.61 OUR COSMIC ORIGINS AND OUR PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE CHANGE HAS COME TO WASHINGTON
JillTarter_2009@1023.88:1031.63 A PROMISE TO PUT SCIENCE IN ITS RIGHTFUL POSITION SO WHAT WOULD CHANGE EVERYTHING
JillTarter_2009@1031.70:1040.84 WELL THIS IS THE QUESTION THE EDGE FOUNDATION ASKED THIS YEAR AND FOUR OF THE RESPONDENTS SAID SETI WHY WELL
JillTarter_2009@1042.06:1054.84 THE DISCOVERY OF INTELLIGENT LIFE BEYOND EARTH WOULD ERADICATE THE LONELINESS AND SOLIPSISM THAT HAS PLAGUED OUR SPECIES SINCE ITS INCEPTION AND IT WOULDN'T SIMPLY CHANGE EVERYTHING IT WOULD CHANGE EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE
JillTarter_2009@1056.06:1063.63 SO IF THAT'S RIGHT WHY DID WE ONLY CAPTURE FOUR OUT OF THOSE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE MINDS I THINK IT'S A PROBLEM
JillTarter_2009@1076.09:1080.84 SO WE HAVE A FULFILLMENT PROBLEM WE NEED BIGGER GLASSES AND MORE HANDS IN THE WATER
JillTarter_2009@1081.26:1084.27 AND THEN WORKING TOGETHER MAYBE WE CAN ALL LIVE TO SEE
JillTarter_2009@1085.11:1088.05 THE DETECTION OF THE FIRST EXTRATERRESTRIAL SIGNAL
JillTarter_2009@1088.99:1090.54 THAT BRINGS ME TO MY WISH
JillTarter_2009@1092.62:1094.52 I WISH THAT YOU WOULD EMPOWER
JillTarter_2009@1095.49:1096.86 EARTHLINGS EVERYWHERE
JillTarter_2009@1097.89:1108.12 TO BECOME ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN THE ULTIMATE SEARCH FOR COSMIC COMPANY THE FIRST STEP WOULD BE TO TAP INTO THE GLOBAL BRAIN TRUST
JillTarter_2009@1108.62:1113.51 TO BUILD AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE RAW DATA COULD BE STORED AND WHERE
JillTarter_2009@1124.68:1126.27 PERSPECTIVE OF PEOPLE WHO WORKED ON IT
JillTarter_2009@1129.22:1130.92 LIKE TO AUGMENT
JillTarter_2009@1131.34:1131.47 THE
JillTarter_2009@1160.67:1171.76 GET THEM OUT TO STUDENTS EVERYWHERE STUDENTS THAT CAN'T COME AND VISIT US AT THE ATA WE'D LIKE TO TELL OUR STORY BETTER AND ENGAGE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEREBY CHANGE THEIR PERSPECTIVE
JillTarter_2009@1172.43:1181.02 I'M SORRY SETH GODIN BUT OVER THE MILLENNIA WE'VE SEEN WHERE TRIBALISM LEADS WE'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DIVIDE AN ALREADY SMALL PLANET
JillTarter_2009@1181.31:1187.09 INTO SMALLER ISLANDS AND ULTIMATELY WE ACTUALLY ALL BELONG TO ONLY
JillTarter_2009@1189.86:1198.19 EARTHLINGS AND SETI IS A MIRROR A MIRROR THAT CAN SHOW US OURSELVES FROM AN EXTRAORDINARY PERSPECTIVE
JillTarter_2009@1210.19:1218.34 IT WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND ENDEAVORS IN HISTORY SO IN THE OPENING DAYS OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINE
JillTarter_2009@1219.37:1223.36 A VISIONARY PRESIDENT STOOD ON THE STEPS OF THE U S CAPITOL AND SAID
JillTarter_2009@1224.60:1228.50 WE CANNOT HELP BUT BELIEVE THAT THE OLD HATREDS SHALL SOMEDAY PASS
JillTarter_2009@1229.44:1234.72 THAT THE LINES OF TRIBE SHALL SOON DISSOLVE THAT AS THE WORLD GROWS SMALLER
JillTarter_2009@1235.07:1236.61 OUR COMMON HUMANITY
JillTarter_2009@1237.02:1244.33 SHALL REVEAL ITSELF SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE TED COMMUNITY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO FULFILL THIS
JillTarter_2009@1244.56:1248.49 WISH AND IN COLLABORATING WITH YOU
