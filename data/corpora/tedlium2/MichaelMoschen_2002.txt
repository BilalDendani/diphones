MichaelMoschen_2002 AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS
MichaelMoschen_2002 AND AS A GOLFER AND AS A KID ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
MichaelMoschen_2002 REALLY SORT OF SEEPED INTO MY PORES THAT I SORT OF LIVED MY WHOLE LIFE IS PROCESS AND IT'S THE PROCESS OF LEARNING THINGS ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS WAS THAT MY FATHER WAS AN AVID GOLFER BUT HE WAS LEFTY
MichaelMoschen_2002 TIME BUT GREW TO KNOW STUFF ABOUT AND THAT WAS THE MYTHOLOGY OF SKILL SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LOVE TO DO IS TO EXPLORE SKILL
MichaelMoschen_2002 AND SINCE RICHARD PUT ME ON THIS WHOLE THING WITH MUSIC I'M SUPPOSED TO ACTUALLY BE DOING A PROJECT WITH TOD MACHOVER WITH THE MIT MEDIA LAB IT RELATES A LOT TO MUSIC
MichaelMoschen_2002 BUT TOD COULDN'T COME AND THE PROJECT IS SORT OF SOMEWHERE I'M NOT SURE WHETHER IT'S HAPPENING THE WAY WE THOUGHT OR NOT BUT I'M GOING TO EXPLORE SKILL AND JUGGLING AND
MichaelMoschen_2002 BASICALLY VISUAL MUSIC I GUESS OK YOU CAN START THE MUSIC THANKS
MichaelMoschen_2002 NOW JUGGLING CAN BE A LOT OF FUN PLAY WITH SKILL AND PLAY WITH SPACE PLAY WITH RHYTHM AND YOU CAN TURN THE MIKE ON NOW I'M GOING TO DO A COUPLE OF PIECES I DO A BIG PIECE IN A TRIANGLE
MichaelMoschen_2002 AND THESE ARE THREE SECTIONS FROM IT PART OF THE CHALLENGE WAS TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND RHYTHM AND SPACE USING NOT JUST MY HANDS BECAUSE A LOT OF JUGGLING IS HAND ORIENTED BUT USING THE RHYTHM OF MY BODY AND FEET AND CONTROLLING THE BALLS WITH MY FEET
MichaelMoschen_2002 AN ATTEMPT TO EXPLORE SPACE YOU SEE I THINK RICHARD SAID SOMETHING ABOUT
MichaelMoschen_2002 JUGGLING GRAVITY UP DOWN IF YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT UP AND DOWN REALLY ARE
MichaelMoschen_2002 A COMPLEX PHYSICAL SET OF SKILLS TO BE ABLE TO THROW A BALL DOWN AND UP AND EVERYTHING BUT THEN YOU ADD IN SIDEWAYS
MichaelMoschen_2002 I LOOK AT IT SOMEWHAT AS A WAY WHEN YOU LEARN JUGGLING WHAT YOU LEARN IS HOW TO FEEL WITH YOUR EYES AND SEE WITH YOUR HANDS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT YOUR HANDS YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHERE THE BALLS ARE OR YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE AUDIENCE SO THIS NEXT PART IS REALLY A WAY OF UNDERSTANDING
MichaelMoschen_2002 AND RHYTHM
MichaelMoschen_2002 WITH THE OBVIOUS REFERENCE TO THE FEET BUT IT'S ALSO TIME WHERE THE FEET WERE WHERE THE BALLS WERE
MichaelMoschen_2002 VISUAL MUSIC RHYTHM AND COMPLEXITY I'M GOING TO BUILD TOWARDS COMPLEXITY NOW JUGGLING THREE BALLS IS SIMPLE AND NORMAL
MichaelMoschen_2002 OK AND REMEMBER YOU'RE TRANSPOSING YOU'RE GETTING INTO A SUBCULTURE HERE
MichaelMoschen_2002 AND JUGGLING THE BALLS CROSS AND ALL THAT OK IF YOU KEEP THEM IN THEIR ASSIGNED PASS
MichaelMoschen_2002 YOU GET OUT OF THE LIGHTS OK CHANGE THE RHYTHM SO IT'S EVEN OR YOU CAN GO BACK
MichaelMoschen_2002 AND CHANGE THE HEIGHT NOW SKILL
MichaelMoschen_2002 BUT YOU'RE BOXED IN IF YOU CAN ONLY DO IT UP AND DOWN THAT WAY SO YOU'VE GOT TO GO AFTER THE SPACE DOWN THERE
MichaelMoschen_2002 AND THEN YOU GET
MichaelMoschen_2002 TIME DOING SOMETHING TIME SLOWS DOWN OR YOUR SKILL INCREASES SO YOUR PERCEPTIONS CHANGE IT'S LEARNING SKILLS LIKE BEING IN A HIGH SPEED CAR CRASH
MichaelMoschen_2002 THINGS SLOW DOWN AS YOU LEARN AS YOU LEARN AS YOU LEARN YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFECT IT IT ALMOST DRIFTS ON YOU IT GOES BUT THAT'S THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATION I CAN HAVE
MichaelMoschen_2002 TO IT SO COMPLEXITY NOW HOW MANY HERE ARE JUGGLERS
MichaelMoschen_2002 OK SO MOST OF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A SIMILAR REACTION TO THIS
MichaelMoschen_2002 OK AND WHOEVER LAUGHED THERE YOU UNDERSTOOD IT COMPLETELY RIGHT
MichaelMoschen_2002 ABLE TO DO SOMETHING THAT OTHER PEOPLE CAN'T DO OR CAN'T UNDERSTAND ALL RIGHT SO THAT'S ONE WAY OF DOING IT WHICH IS FIVE BALLS DOWN OK ANOTHER WAY IS THE OUTSIDE
MichaelMoschen_2002 AND YOU COULD PLAY WITH THE RHYTHM SAME PATTERN MAKE IT FASTER AND SMALLER MAKE IT WIDER
MichaelMoschen_2002 MAKE IT NARROWER BRING IT BACK UP
MichaelMoschen_2002 NOW WHAT I WANTED TO GET TO IS THAT YOU'RE ALL VERY BRIGHT VERY TACTILE I HAVE NO IDEA HOW COMPUTER ORIENTED OR THREE DIMENSIONALLY ORIENTED YOU ARE BUT LET 'S TRY SOMETHING OK SO SINCE YOU ALL
MichaelMoschen_2002 DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FIVE BALL PATTERN IS I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE CLUE
MichaelMoschen_2002 NOW DO ME A
MichaelMoschen_2002 FOLLOW THE BALL THAT I ASK YOU
MichaelMoschen_2002 GREEN YELLOW PINK WHITE
MichaelMoschen_2002 OK YOU CAN DO THAT YEAH OK NOW LET 'S ACTUALLY LEARN SOMETHING ACTUALLY LET ME PUT YOU IN THAT AREA OF LEARNING WHICH IS VERY INSECURE YOU WANT TO DO IT YEAH
MichaelMoschen_2002 HANDS
MichaelMoschen_2002 SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS JUST LISTEN TO ME AND
MichaelMoschen_2002 INDEX FINGER MIDDLE FINGER RING LITTLE LITTLE RING MIDDLE INDEX AND THEN OPEN
MichaelMoschen_2002 ONE LEARNING PROCESS THAT I SEE IS THIS
MichaelMoschen_2002 ANOTHER LEARNING PROCESS THAT I SEE IS THIS
MichaelMoschen_2002 BREATH
MichaelMoschen_2002 OK NOW ONE MORE TIME AND
MichaelMoschen_2002 FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER OPEN FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER
MichaelMoschen_2002 OK SHAKE YOUR HANDS OUT NOW
MichaelMoschen_2002 I ASSUME A LOT OF YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME AT A COMPUTER OK SO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE GOING LA LA LA AND YOU'RE GETTING THIS
MichaelMoschen_2002 BUT I WANT YOU TO DO IS ALSO WITH YOUR EYES IS FOLLOW THE COLORED BALL
MichaelMoschen_2002 WHITE BALL AND
MichaelMoschen_2002 FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER PINK FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER GREEN FINGER FINGER FINGER FINGER YELLOW FINGER FINGER
MichaelMoschen_2002 PEOPLE FACE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES A MOMENT OF LEARNING A MOMENT OF CHALLENGE IT'S A MOMENT THAT YOU CAN'T MAKE SENSE OF WHY THE HELL SHOULD I LEARN THIS
MichaelMoschen_2002 REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING IN MY LIFE YOU KNOW I CAN'T DECIPHER IS IT FUN IS IT CHALLENGING AM I SUPPOSED TO CHEAT
MichaelMoschen_2002 WHICH WAS ALL ABOUT THAT A MOMENT AND WHAT I DO AS A CREATIVE ARTIST IS I DEVELOP VOCABULARIES OR LANGUAGES OF MOVING OBJECTS
MichaelMoschen_2002 WHAT I'VE DONE FOR YOU HERE I DEVELOPED A LOT OF THOSE TRICKS AND I PUT THE CHOREOGRAPHY TOGETHER BUT THEY'RE NOT ORIGINAL TECHNIQUES NOW I'M GOING TO START SHOWING YOU SOME ORIGINAL TECHNIQUES
MichaelMoschen_2002 THAT COME FROM THE WORK THAT I'VE DEVELOPED OK SO A MOMENT HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE A MOMENT WELL AS A JUGGLER
MichaelMoschen_2002 A MOMENT
MichaelMoschen_2002 AND DO IT SO A MOMENT
MichaelMoschen_2002 OK AND THEN WHAT I DID AS A JUGGLER WAS SAY OK WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE THAT SOMETHING THAT IS DEPENDENT ON SOMETHING ELSE ANOTHER
MichaelMoschen_2002 A MOMENT
MichaelMoschen_2002 ANOTHER
MichaelMoschen_2002 A MOMENT
MichaelMoschen_2002 A MOMENT
MichaelMoschen_2002 AND COMES BACK TOGETHER TIME HOW CAN YOU LOOK AT TIME AND WHAT DO YOU DEDICATE IT TO IN EXPLORING A PARTICULAR THING
MichaelMoschen_2002 A GUESS AS TO WHAT IT IS THERE'S A MYSTERY THERE'S A MYSTERY IN THE MOMENT
MichaelMoschen_2002 OK CAN WE SHOW THE VIDEO OF THE TRIANGLE ARE WE READY TO DO THAT
MichaelMoschen_2002 YES THIS IS THE PIECE THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT IT'S A MUCH BIGGER PIECE THAT I DO EXPLORING THE SPACE OF A GEOMETRIC TRIANGLE
MichaelMoschen_2002 ABOUT THE LAST SESSION IS YOU EVER TRY JUGGLING AND DRIVING THE CAR WITH YOUR KNEES AT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES AN HOUR
MichaelMoschen_2002 THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT WAS A REAL SHOCK I ALWAYS DROVE MOTORCYCLES AND WHEN I BOUGHT MY FIRST CAR
MichaelMoschen_2002 IT SHOCKED ME THAT IT COST THREE TIMES MORE THAN MY PARENTS HOUSE INTERESTING ANYWAY
MichaelMoschen_2002 BALANCE CONSTANT MOVEMENT TO FIND AN APPROACH TO STILLNESS
MichaelMoschen_2002 CHEATING
MichaelMoschen_2002 MAKING UP THE RULES SO YOU CAN'T CHEAT SO YOU LEARN
MichaelMoschen_2002 TO APPROACH STILLNESS WITH DIFFERENT PARTS OF YOUR BODY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH IT
MichaelMoschen_2002 NOW IT'S DEPENDENT ON RHYTHM
MichaelMoschen_2002 CENTER OF BALANCE WHEN IT FALLS GOING UNDERNEATH SO THERE'S A RHYTHM TO IT THE RHYTHM
MichaelMoschen_2002 AS YOUR SKILL INCREASES YOU LEARN TO FIND THOSE TINIER SPACES THOSE TINIER MOVEMENTS
MichaelMoschen_2002 SHOW YOU THE BEGINNINGS OF A PIECE THAT IS ABOUT BALANCE IN SOME WAYS AND ALSO OH ACTUALLY
MichaelMoschen_2002 NOT HERE HERE 'S ONE USE FOR
MichaelMoschen_2002 CAN GO WITH THE STICKS ONE MUSIC
MichaelMoschen_2002 KIND OF BALANCE TO IT WHICH IS ALL ABOUT PLUMB I APPRENTICED WITH A CARPENTER AND LEARNED ABOUT PLUMB SQUARE AND LEVEL
MichaelMoschen_2002 AND THIS NEXT PIECE WHICH I'LL DO A LITTLE SEGMENT OF TWO STICKS YOU CAN GO
MichaelMoschen_2002 IS AGAIN
MichaelMoschen_2002 WITH SPACE AND THE LINES IN SPACE IN A DIFFERENT WAY
MichaelMoschen_2002 TO THAT IN A SECOND BUT WORKING WITH ONE BALL NOW WHAT IF YOU ATTACH SOMETHING TO IT
MichaelMoschen_2002 OR
MichaelMoschen_2002 THIS IS A LITTLE THING THAT I MADE BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF CURVES AND BALLS TOGETHER
MichaelMoschen_2002 AND THEN
MichaelMoschen_2002 CREATING SPACE AND THE RHYTHM OF SPACE USING THE SURFACE OF THE BALLS THE SURFACE OF THE ARMS
MichaelMoschen_2002 WHICH LEADS ME TO THE NEXT THING WHICH IS
MichaelMoschen_2002 HERE OK
MichaelMoschen_2002 ACTUALLY LEADING UP TO SOMETHING THE NEWEST THING THAT I'M WORKING ON THIS IS NOT IT THIS IS EXPLORING GEOMETRY AND THE RHYTHM OF SHAPE
MichaelMoschen_2002 WHAT I JUST DID WAS I WORKED WITH THE MATHEMATICS THE DIAMETER AND THE CIRCUMFERENCE SOMETIMES THESE PIECES ARE
MichaelMoschen_2002 AFFECTS MY CHOICE OF OBJECTS THAT I TRY TO WORK WITH THE NEXT PIECE THAT I'M GOING TO DO WHICH IS THE CYLINDERS PIECE IF YOU WANT TO GET THAT UP IT
MichaelMoschen_2002 HAS TO DO WITH CYLINDER SEALS FROM ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO WHICH WERE STONES WITH DESIGNS THAT WERE USED TO ROLL OVER WET CLAY
MichaelMoschen_2002 ABOUT GEOMETRY AND EVERYTHING IF YOU TAKE THE CIRCLE AND YOU SPLIT IT IN HALF CAN YOU RUN S CURVE MUSIC I'M GOING TO DO JUST A SHORT VERSION OF IT
MichaelMoschen_2002 THAT PIECE ALSO
MichaelMoschen_2002 TWO MINUTES JUST TO END THE LATEST PIECE THAT I'M WORKING ON WHAT I LOVE IS THAT I NEVER KNOW WHAT I'M WORKING ON WHY I'M WORKING ON IT THEY'RE NOT IDEAS THEY'RE INSTINCTS AND THE LATEST THING THAT I'M WORKING ON
MichaelMoschen_2002 SOMETHING REALLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS YET AND THAT'S GOOD
MichaelMoschen_2002 I LIKE NOT TO KNOW FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
MichaelMoschen_2002 WELL BECAUSE THEN IT TELLS ME THE TRUTH INSTEAD OF ME IMPOSING THE TRUTH AND WHAT IT IS IS WORKING WITH BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SPACE BUT ALSO WITH THESE CURVES
MichaelMoschen_2002 PLAYING WITH THE SENSE OF SPACE OF FILLING IN THE SPACE AND THEN IT STARTED CHANGING
MichaelMoschen_2002 BECOME FOLDING ON THEMSELVES
MichaelMoschen_2002 TRY ONE OTHER THING
MichaelMoschen_2002 WORK IN THREE DIMENSIONS WITH YOUR PERCEPTIONS OF SPACE AND TIME NOW I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT'S GOING BUT I'VE GOT A BIT OF EFFORT INVOLVED IN THIS THING AND IT'S GOING TO CHANGE AS I GO THROUGH IT
MichaelMoschen_2002 BUT I REALLY LIKE IT FEELS RIGHT THIS MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT SHAPE AND I'LL LOOK AT THIS SHAPE AND THEN I'LL SHOW YOU THE FIRST DESIGN I EVER PUT TO IT
MichaelMoschen_2002 JUST TO SEE JUST TO PLAY BECAUSE I LOVE ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS TO PLAY WITH LET 'S SEE HERE TO WORK WITH THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IN A DIFFERENT WAY
MichaelMoschen_2002 AND TO CHANGE AND TO CHANGE SO I'M OFF IN MY NEW DIRECTION WITH THIS TO EXPLORE RHYTHM AND SPACE WE'LL SEE WHAT I COME
