PaulSnelgrove_2011G COVER SOME SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR PLANET AND I THINK ARTHUR C CLARKE PROBABLY HAD IT RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THAT PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO CALL OUR PLANET PLANET OCEAN
PaulSnelgrove_2011G IN ADDITION TO THAT IT HARBORS A LOT OF THE BIODIVERSITY ON EARTH AND MUCH OF IT WE DON 'T KNOW ABOUT BUT I 'LL TELL YOU SOME OF THAT TODAY THAT ALSO DOESN 'T EVEN GET INTO THE WHOLE PROTEIN EXTRACTION THAT WE DO FROM THE OCEAN THAT 'S ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF OUR GLOBAL NEEDS AND ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF SOME ISLAND NATIONS
PaulSnelgrove_2011G IF YOU WERE TO DESCEND INTO THE NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE BIOSPHERE THAT 'S LIVABLE IT WOULD QUICKLY BECOME PITCH BLACK INTERRUPTED ONLY BY PINPOINTS OF LIGHT FROM BIOLUMINESCENT ORGANISMS AND IF YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON YOU MIGHT PERIODICALLY SEE SPECTACULAR ORGANISMS SWIM BY BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE DENIZENS OF THE DEEP THE THINGS THAT LIVE IN THE DEEP OCEAN
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND EVENTUALLY THE DEEP SEA FLOOR WOULD COME INTO VIEW THIS TYPE OF HABITAT COVERS MORE OF THE EARTH 'S SURFACE THAN ALL OTHER HABITATS COMBINED AND YET WE KNOW MORE ABOUT THE SURFACE OF THE MOON AND ABOUT MARS THAN WE DO ABOUT THIS HABITAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE YET TO EXTRACT A GRAM OF FOOD A BREATH OF OXYGEN OR A DROP OF WATER FROM THOSE BODIES
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND SO TEN YEARS AGO AN INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM BEGAN CALLED THE CENSUS OF MARINE LIFE WHICH SET OUT TO TRY AND IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE IN THE GLOBAL OCEANS
PaulSnelgrove_2011G IT INVOLVED SEVENTEEN DIFFERENT PROJECTS AROUND THE WORLD AS YOU CAN SEE THESE ARE THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DIFFERENT PROJECTS AND I HOPE YOU 'LL APPRECIATE THE LEVEL OF GLOBAL COVERAGE THAT IT MANAGED TO ACHIEVE IT ALL BEGAN WHEN TWO SCIENTISTS FRED GRASSLE AND JESSE AUSUBEL MET IN WOODS HOLE MASSACHUSETTS WHERE BOTH WERE GUESTS AT THE FAMED OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTITUTE
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND FRED WAS LAMENTING THE STATE OF MARINE BIODIVERSITY AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS IN TROUBLE AND NOTHING WAS BEING DONE ABOUT IT WELL FROM THAT DISCUSSION GREW THIS PROGRAM THAT INVOLVED TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SCIENTISTS FROM MORE THAN EIGHTY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD WHO ENGAGED IN FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY OCEAN EXPEDITIONS
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND SO WHAT DID WE FIND WE FOUND SPECTACULAR NEW SPECIES THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND VISUALLY STUNNING THINGS EVERYWHERE WE LOOKED FROM THE SHORELINE TO THE ABYSS FORM MICROBES ALL THE WAY UP TO FISH AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND THE LIMITING STEP HERE WASN 'T THE UNKNOWN DIVERSITY OF LIFE BUT RATHER THE TAXONOMIC SPECIALISTS WHO CAN IDENTIFY AND CATALOG THESE SPECIES THAT BECAME THE LIMITING STEP THEY IN FACT ARE AN ENDANGERED SPECIES THEMSELVES THERE ARE ACTUALLY FOUR TO FIVE NEW SPECIES DESCRIBED EVERYDAY FOR THE OCEANS AND AS I SAY IT COULD BE A MUCH LARGER NUMBER
PaulSnelgrove_2011G NOW I COME FROM NEWFOUNDLAND IN CANADA IT 'S AN ISLAND OFF THE EAST COAST OF THAT CONTINENT WHERE WE EXPERIENCED ONE OF THE WORST FISHING DISASTERS IN HUMAN HISTORY
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND SO THIS PHOTOGRAPH SHOWS A SMALL BOY NEXT TO A CODFISH IT 'S AROUND ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NOW WHEN I WAS A BOY OF ABOUT HIS AGE I WOULD GO OUT FISHING WITH MY GRANDFATHER AND WE WOULD CATCH FISH ABOUT HALF THAT SIZE AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE NORM BECAUSE I HAD NEVER SEEN FISH LIKE THIS IF YOU WERE TO GO OUT THERE TODAY TWENTY YEARS AFTER THIS FISHERY COLLAPSED
PaulSnelgrove_2011G IF YOU COULD CATCH A FISH WHICH WOULD BE A BIT OF A CHALLENGE IT WOULD BE HALF THAT SIZE STILL SO WHAT WE 'RE EXPERIENCING IS SOMETHING CALLED SHIFTING BASELINES OUR EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE OCEANS CAN PRODUCE IS SOMETHING THAT WE DON 'T REALLY APPRECIATE BECAUSE WE HAVEN 'T SEEN IT IN OUR LIFETIMES
PaulSnelgrove_2011G NOW MOST OF US AND I WOULD SAY ME INCLUDED THINK THAT HUMAN EXPLOITATION OF THE OCEANS REALLY ONLY BECAME VERY SERIOUS IN THE LAST FIFTY TO PERHAPS ONE HUNDRED YEARS OR SO
PaulSnelgrove_2011G THE CENSUS ACTUALLY TRIED TO LOOK BACK IN TIME USING EVERY SOURCE OF INFORMATION THEY COULD GET THEIR HANDS ON AND SO ANYTHING FROM RESTAURANT MENUS TO MONASTERY RECORDS TO SHIPS LOGS TO SEE WHAT THE OCEANS LOOKED LIKE BECAUSE SCIENCE DATA REALLY GOES BACK TO AT BEST WORLD WAR II FOR THE MOST PART
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND SO WHAT THEY FOUND IN FACT IS THAT EXPLOITATION REALLY BEGAN HEAVILY WITH THE ROMANS AND SO AT THAT TIME OF COURSE THERE WAS NO REFRIGERATION SO FISHERMEN COULD ONLY CATCH WHAT THEY COULD EITHER EAT OR SELL THAT DAY
PaulSnelgrove_2011G BUT THE ROMANS DEVELOPED SALTING AND WITH SALTING IT BECAME POSSIBLE TO STORE FISH AND TO TRANSPORT IT LONG DISTANCES AND SO BEGAN INDUSTRIAL FISHING
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND SO THESE ARE THE SORTS OF EXTRAPOLATIONS THAT WE HAVE OF WHAT SORT OF LOSS WE 'VE HAD RELATIVE TO PRE HUMAN IMPACTS ON THE OCEAN THEY RANGE FROM SIXTY FIVE TO NINETY EIGHT PERCENT FOR THESE MAJOR GROUPS OF ORGANISMS AS SHOWN IN THE DARK BLUE BARS
PaulSnelgrove_2011G NOW FOR THOSE SPECIES THE WE MANAGED TO LEAVE ALONE THAT WE PROTECT FOR EXAMPLE MARINE MAMMALS IN RECENT YEARS AND SEA BIRDS THERE IS SOME RECOVERY SO IT 'S NOT ALL HOPELESS BUT FOR THE MOST PART WE 'VE GONE FROM SALTING TO EXHAUSTING
PaulSnelgrove_2011G NOW THIS OTHER LINE OF EVIDENCE IS A REALLY INTERESTING ONE IT 'S FROM TROPHY FISH CAUGHT OFF THE COAST OF FLORIDA AND SO THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPH FROM THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY S I WANT YOU TO NOTICE THE SCALE ON THE SLIDE BECAUSE WHEN YOU SEE THE SAME PICTURE FROM THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY S WE SEE THE FISH ARE MUCH SMALLER AND WE 'RE ALSO SEEING A CHANGE IN TERMS OF THE COMPOSITION OF THOSE FISH
PaulSnelgrove_2011G BY TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THE CATCH WAS ACTUALLY LAUGHABLE IN TERMS OF THE SIZE FOR A TROPHY FISH BUT THIS IS NO LAUGHING MATTER THE OCEANS HAVE LOST A LOT OF THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND WE 'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT
PaulSnelgrove_2011G SO ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT WE USE TO SAMPLE THE DEEP OCEAN ARE REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLES SO THESE ARE TETHERED VEHICLES WE LOWER DOWN TO THE SEA FLOOR WHERE THEY 'RE OUR EYES AND OUR HANDS FOR WORKING ON THE SEA BOTTOM
PaulSnelgrove_2011G SO A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO ON AN OCEANOGRAPHIC CRUISE AND I COULDN 'T GO BECAUSE OF A SCHEDULING CONFLICT
PaulSnelgrove_2011G BUT THROUGH A SATELLITE LINK I WAS ABLE TO SIT AT MY STUDY AT HOME WITH MY DOG CURLED UP AT MY FEET A CUP OF TEA IN MY HAND AND I COULD TELL THE PILOT I WANT A SAMPLE RIGHT THERE AND THAT 'S EXACTLY WHAT THE PILOT DID FOR ME THAT 'S THE SORT OF TECHNOLOGY THAT 'S AVAILABLE TODAY THAT REALLY WASN 'T AVAILABLE EVEN A DECADE AGO SO IT ALLOWS US TO SAMPLE THESE AMAZING HABITATS
PaulSnelgrove_2011G THAT ARE VERY FAR FROM THE SURFACE AND VERY FAR FROM LIGHT
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND SO ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT WE CAN USE TO SAMPLE THE OCEANS IS ACOUSTICS OR SOUND WAVES AND THE ADVANTAGE OF SOUND WAVES IS THAT THEY ACTUALLY PASS WELL THROUGH WATER UNLIKE LIGHT AND SO WE CAN SEND OUT SOUND WAVES THEY BOUNCE OFF OBJECTS LIKE FISH AND ARE REFLECTED BACK
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND SO IN THIS EXAMPLE A CENSUS SCIENTIST TOOK OUT TWO SHIPS ONE WOULD SEND OUT SOUND WAVES THAT WOULD BOUNCE BACK THEY WOULD BE RECEIVED BY A SECOND SHIP AND THAT WOULD GIVE US VERY PRECISE ESTIMATES IN THIS CASE OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION HERRING IN A PERIOD OF ABOUT A MINUTE AND THAT 'S AN AREA ABOUT THE SIZE OF MANHATTAN ISLAND
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IS A TREMENDOUS FISHERIES TOOL BECAUSE KNOWING HOW MANY FISH ARE THERE IS REALLY CRITICAL
PaulSnelgrove_2011G WE CAN ALSO USE SATELLITE TAGS TO TRACK ANIMALS AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE OCEANS AND SO FOR ANIMALS THAT COME TO THE SURFACE TO BREATHE SUCH AS THIS ELEPHANT SEAL IT 'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEND DATA BACK TO SHORE AND TELL US WHERE EXACTLY IT IS IN THE OCEAN
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND SO FROM THAT WE CAN PRODUCE THESE TRACKS FOR EXAMPLE THE DARK BLUE SHOWS YOU WHERE THE ELEPHANT SEAL MOVED IN THE NORTH PACIFIC NOW I REALIZE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE COLORBLIND THIS SLIDE IS NOT VERY HELPFUL BUT STICK WITH ME NONETHELESS
PaulSnelgrove_2011G FOR ANIMALS THAT DON 'T SURFACE WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED POP UP TAGS WHICH COLLECT DATA ABOUT LIGHT AND WHAT TIME THE SUN RISES AND SETS AND THEN AT SOME PERIOD OF TIME IT POPS UP TO THE SURFACE AND AGAIN RELAYS THAT DATA BACK TO SHORE BECAUSE GPS DOESN 'T WORK UNDER WATER THAT 'S WHY WE NEED THESE TOOLS
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND SO FROM THIS WE 'RE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THESE BLUE HIGHWAYS THESE HOT SPOTS IN THE OCEAN THAT SHOULD BE REAL PRIORITY AREAS FOR OCEAN CONSERVATION
PaulSnelgrove_2011G NOW ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU MAY THINK ABOUT IS THAT WHEN YOU GO TO THE SUPERMARKET AND YOU BUY THINGS THEY 'RE SCANNED AND SO THERE 'S A BARCODE ON THAT PRODUCT THAT TELLS THE COMPUTER EXACTLY WHAT THE PRODUCT IS
PaulSnelgrove_2011G GENETICISTS HAVE DEVELOPED A SIMILAR TOOL CALLED GENETIC BARCODING AND WHAT BARCODING DOES IS USE A SPECIFIC GENE CALLED CO ONE THAT 'S CONSISTENT WITHIN A SPECIES BUT VARIES AMONG SPECIES AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE CAN UNAMBIGUOUSLY IDENTIFY WHICH SPECIES ARE WHICH EVEN IF THEY LOOK SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER BUT MAY BE BIOLOGICALLY QUITE DIFFERENT
PaulSnelgrove_2011G NOW ONE OF THE NICEST EXAMPLES I LIKE TO CITE ON THIS IS THE STORY OF TWO YOUNG WOMEN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN NEW YORK CITY WHO WORKED WITH THE CENSUS THEY WENT OUT AND COLLECTED FISH FROM MARKETS AND FROM RESTAURANTS IN NEW YORK CITY AND THEY BARCODED IT WELL WHAT THEY FOUND WAS MISLABELED FISH
PaulSnelgrove_2011G SO FOR EXAMPLE THEY FOUND SOMETHING WHICH WAS SOLD AS TUNA WHICH IS VERY VALUABLE WAS IN FACT TILAPIA WHICH IS A MUCH LESS VALUABLE FISH
PaulSnelgrove_2011G THEY ALSO FOUND AN ENDANGERED SPECIES SOLD AS A COMMON ONE SO BARCODING ALLOWS US TO KNOW WHAT WE 'RE WORKING WITH AND ALSO WHAT WE 'RE EATING
PaulSnelgrove_2011G THE OCEAN BIOGEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM IS THE DATABASE FOR ALL THE CENSUS DATA IT 'S OPEN ACCESS YOU CAN ALL GO IN AND DOWNLOAD DATA AS YOU WISH
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND IT CONTAINS ALL THE DATA FROM THE CENSUS PLUS OTHER DATA SETS THAT PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE AND SO WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THAT IS TO PLOT THE DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIES AND WHERE THEY OCCUR IN THE OCEANS WHAT I 'VE PLOTTED UP HERE IS THE DATA THAT WE HAVE ON HAND THIS IS WHERE OUR SAMPLING EFFORT HAS CONCENTRATED NOW WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS WE 'VE SAMPLED THE AREA IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC
PaulSnelgrove_2011G IN THE NORTH SEA IN PARTICULAR AND ALSO THE EAST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA FAIRLY WELL THAT 'S THE WARM COLORS WHICH SHOW A WELL SAMPLED REGION THE COLD COLORS THE BLUE AND THE BLACK SHOW AREAS WHERE WE HAVE ALMOST NO DATA SO EVEN AFTER A TEN YEAR CENSUS THERE ARE LARGE AREAS THAT STILL REMAIN UNEXPLORED
PaulSnelgrove_2011G NOW THERE ARE A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS LIVING IN TEXAS WORKING IN THE GULF OF MEXICO WHO DECIDED REALLY AS A LABOR OF LOVE TO PULL TOGETHER ALL THE KNOWLEDGE THEY COULD ABOUT BIODIVERSITY IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND SO THEY PUT THIS TOGETHER A LIST OF ALL THE SPECIES WHERE THEY 'RE KNOWN TO OCCUR AND IT REALLY SEEMED LIKE A VERY ESOTERIC SCIENTIFIC TYPE OF EXERCISE
PaulSnelgrove_2011G SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE DISCOVERED IS WHERE ARE THE HOT SPOTS OF DIVERSITY WHERE DO WE FIND THE MOST SPECIES OF OCEAN LIFE
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND WHAT WE FIND IF WE PLOT UP THE WELL KNOWN SPECIES IS THIS SORT OF A DISTRIBUTION
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND WHAT WE SEE IS THAT FOR COASTAL TAGS FOR THOSE ORGANISMS THAT LIVE NEAR THE SHORELINE THEY 'RE MOST DIVERSE IN THE TROPICS THIS IS SOMETHING WE 'VE ACTUALLY KNOWN FOR A WHILE SO IT 'S NOT A REAL BREAKTHROUGH WHAT IS REALLY EXCITING THOUGH IS THAT THE OCEANIC TAGS OR THE ONES THAT LIVE FAR FROM THE COAST ARE ACTUALLY MORE DIVERSE AT INTERMEDIATE LATITUDES
PaulSnelgrove_2011G THIS IS THE SORT OF DATA AGAIN THAT MANAGERS COULD USE IF THEY WANT TO PRIORITIZE AREAS OF THE OCEAN THAT WE NEED TO CONSERVE YOU CAN DO THIS ON A GLOBAL SCALE BUT YOU CAN ALSO DO IT ON A REGIONAL SCALE AND THAT 'S WHY BIODIVERSITY DATA CAN BE SO VALUABLE
PaulSnelgrove_2011G NOW WHILE A LOT OF THE SPECIES WE DISCOVERED IN THE CENSUS ARE THINGS THAT ARE SMALL AND HARD TO SEE THAT CERTAINLY WASN 'T ALWAYS THE CASE FOR EXAMPLE WHILE IT 'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A THREE KILOGRAM LOBSTER COULD ELUDE SCIENTISTS IT DID UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN SOUTH AFRICAN FISHERMEN REQUESTED AN EXPORT PERMIT AND SCIENTISTS REALIZED THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING NEW TO SCIENCE
PaulSnelgrove_2011G SIMILARLY THIS GOLDEN V KELP COLLECTED IN ALASKA JUST BELOW THE LOW WATER MARK IS PROBABLY A NEW SPECIES EVEN THOUGH IT 'S THREE METERS LONG IT ACTUALLY AGAIN ELUDED SCIENCE
PaulSnelgrove_2011G NOW THIS GUY THIS BIGFIN SQUID IS SEVEN METERS IN LENGTH BUT TO BE FAIR IT LIVES IN THE DEEP WATERS OF THE MID ATLANTIC RIDGE SO IT WAS A LOT HARDER TO FIND
PaulSnelgrove_2011G BUT THERE 'S STILL POTENTIAL FOR DISCOVERY OF BIG AND EXCITING THINGS
PaulSnelgrove_2011G THIS PARTICULAR SHRIMP WE 'VE DUBBED IT THE JURASSIC SHRIMP IT 'S THOUGHT TO HAVE GONE EXTINCT FIFTY YEARS AGO AT LEAST IT WAS UNTIL THE CENSUS DISCOVERED IT WAS LIVING AND DOING JUST FINE OFF THE COAST OF AUSTRALIA AND IT SHOWS THAT THE OCEAN BECAUSE OF ITS VASTNESS CAN HIDE SECRETS FOR A VERY LONG TIME SO STEVEN SPIELBERG EAT YOUR HEART OUT
PaulSnelgrove_2011G IF WE LOOK AT DISTRIBUTIONS IN FACT DISTRIBUTIONS CHANGE DRAMATICALLY AND SO ONE OF THE RECORDS THAT WE HAD WAS THIS SOOTY SHEARWATER WHICH UNDERGOES THESE SPECTACULAR MIGRATIONS ALL THE WAY FROM NEW ZEALAND ALL THE WAY UP TO ALASKA AND BACK AGAIN IN SEARCH OF ENDLESS SUMMER AS THEY COMPLETE THEIR LIFE CYCLES
PaulSnelgrove_2011G WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE WHITE SHARK CAFE THIS IS A LOCATION IN THE PACIFIC WHERE WHITE SHARK CONVERGE WE DON 'T KNOW WHY THEY CONVERGE THERE WE SIMPLY DON 'T KNOW THAT 'S A QUESTION FOR THE FUTURE
PaulSnelgrove_2011G ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE 'RE TAUGHT IN HIGH SCHOOL IS THAT ALL ANIMALS REQUIRE OXYGEN IN ORDER TO SURVIVE NOW THIS LITTLE CRITTER IT 'S ONLY ABOUT HALF A MILLIMETER IN SIZE NOT TERRIBLY CHARISMATIC
PaulSnelgrove_2011G BUT IT WAS ONLY DISCOVERED IN THE EARLY ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY S BUT THE REALLY INTERESTING THING ABOUT IT IS THAT A FEW YEARS AGO CENSUS SCIENTISTS DISCOVERED THAT THIS GUY CAN THRIVE IN OXYGEN POOR SEDIMENTS IN THE DEEP MEDITERRANEAN SEA SO NOW THEY KNOW THAT IN FACT ANIMALS CAN LIVE WITHOUT OXYGEN AT LEAST SOME OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN ADAPT TO EVEN THE HARSHEST OF CONDITIONS
PaulSnelgrove_2011G IF YOU WERE TO SUCK ALL THE WATER OUT OF THE OCEAN THIS IS WHAT YOU 'D BE LEFT BEHIND WITH AND THAT 'S THE BIOMASS OF LIFE ON THE SEA FLOOR NOW WHAT WE SEE IS HUGE BIOMASS TOWARDS THE POLES AND NOT MUCH BIOMASS IN BETWEEN
PaulSnelgrove_2011G WE FOUND LIFE IN THE EXTREMES AND SO THERE WERE NEW SPECIES THAT WERE FOUND THAT LIVE INSIDE ICE AND HELP TO SUPPORT AN ICE BASED FOOD WEB AND WE ALSO FOUND THIS SPECTACULAR YETI CRAB THAT LIVES NEAR BOILING HOT HYDROTHERMAL VENTS AT EASTER ISLAND AND THIS PARTICULAR SPECIES REALLY CAPTURED THE PUBLIC 'S ATTENTION
PaulSnelgrove_2011G WE ALSO FOUND THE DEEPEST VENTS KNOWN YET FIVE THOUSAND METERS THE HOTTEST VENTS AT FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVEN DEGREES CELSIUS VENTS IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC AND ALSO IN THE ARCTIC WHERE NONE HAD BEEN FOUND BEFORE SO EVEN NEW ENVIRONMENTS ARE STILL WITHIN THE DOMAIN OF THE DISCOVERABLE NOW IN TERMS OF THE UNKNOWNS THERE ARE MANY AND I 'M JUST GOING TO SUMMARIZE JUST A FEW OF THEM VERY QUICKLY FOR YOU
PaulSnelgrove_2011G FIRST OF ALL WE MIGHT ASK HOW MANY FISHES IN THE SEA WE ACTUALLY KNOW THE FISHES BETTER THAN WE DO ANY OTHER GROUP IN THE OCEAN OTHER THAN MARINE MAMMALS
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND SO WE CAN ACTUALLY EXTRAPOLATE BASED ON RATES OF DISCOVERY HOW MANY MORE SPECIES WE 'RE LIKELY TO DISCOVER AND FROM THAT WE ACTUALLY CALCULATE THAT WE KNOW ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MARINE SPECIES AND THERE ARE PROBABLY ANOTHER ONE THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND LEFT TO GO SO WE 'VE DONE PRETTY WELL WE 'VE GOT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FISH MAYBE AS MUCH AS NINETY PERCENT
PaulSnelgrove_2011G BUT THE FISHES AS I SAY ARE THE BEST KNOWN SO OUR LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE IS MUCH LESS FOR OTHER GROUPS OF ORGANISMS
PaulSnelgrove_2011G NOW THIS FIGURE IS ACTUALLY BASED ON A BRAND NEW PAPER THAT 'S GOING TO COME OUT IN THE JOURNAL PLOS BIOLOGY AND WHAT IS DOES IS PREDICT HOW MANY MORE SPECIES THERE ARE ON LAND AND IN THE OCEAN
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT THEY THINK THAT WE KNOW OF ABOUT NINE PERCENT OF THE SPECIES IN THE OCEAN THAT MEANS NINETY ONE PERCENT EVEN AFTER THE CENSUS STILL REMAIN TO BE DISCOVERED AND SO THAT TURNS OUT TO BE ABOUT TWO MILLION SPECIES ONCE ALL IS SAID AND DONE SO WE STILL HAVE QUITE A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN TERMS OF UNKNOWNS
PaulSnelgrove_2011G NOW THIS BACTERIUM IS PART OF MATS THAT ARE FOUND OFF THE COAST OF CHILE AND THESE MATS ACTUALLY COVER AN AREA THE SIZE OF GREECE
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND SO THIS PARTICULAR BACTERIUM IS ACTUALLY VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE THE BIOMASS THAT REPRESENTS BUT THE REALLY INTRIGUING THING ABOUT THE MICROBES IS JUST HOW DIVERSE THEY ARE A SINGLE DROP OF SEAWATER COULD CONTAIN ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MICROBES
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND THE OCEANS THEMSELVES ARE THOUGHT POTENTIALLY TO CONTAIN AS MANY AS A BILLION DIFFERENT TYPES SO THAT 'S REALLY EXCITING WHAT ARE THEY ALL DOING OUT THERE WE ACTUALLY DON 'T KNOW
PaulSnelgrove_2011G THE MOST EXCITING THING I WOULD SAY ABOUT THIS CENSUS IS THE ROLE OF GLOBAL SCIENCE AND SO AS WE SEE IN THIS IMAGE OF LIGHT DURING THE NIGHT THERE ARE LOTS OF AREAS OF THE EARTH WHERE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IS MUCH GREATER AND OTHER AREAS WHERE IT 'S MUCH LESS BUT BETWEEN THEM WE SEE LARGE DARK AREAS OF RELATIVELY UNEXPLORED OCEAN
PaulSnelgrove_2011G THE OTHER POINT I 'D LIKE TO MAKE ABOUT THIS IS THAT THIS OCEAN 'S INTERCONNECTED MARINE ORGANISMS DO NOT CARE ABOUT INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARIES THEY MOVE WHERE THEY WILL AND SO THE IMPORTANCE THEN OF GLOBAL COLLABORATION BECOMES ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT
PaulSnelgrove_2011G WE 'VE LOST A LOT OF PARADISE FOR EXAMPLE THESE TUNA THAT WERE ONCE SO ABUNDANT IN THE NORTH SEA ARE NOW EFFECTIVELY GONE THERE WERE TRAWLS TAKEN IN THE DEEP SEA IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WHICH COLLECTED MORE GARBAGE THAN THEY DID ANIMALS AND THAT 'S THE DEEP SEA THAT 'S THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE CONSIDER TO BE AMONG THE MOST PRISTINE LEFT ON EARTH
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER PRESSURES OCEAN ACIDIFICATION IS A REALLY BIG ISSUE THAT PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED WITH AS WELL AS OCEAN WARMING AND THE EFFECTS THEY 'RE GOING TO HAVE ON CORAL REEFS ON THE SCALE OF DECADES IN OUR LIFETIMES WE 'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF DAMAGE TO CORAL REEFS
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND I COULD SPEND THE REST OF MY TIME WHICH IS GETTING VERY LIMITED GOING THROUGH THIS LITANY OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE OCEAN BUT I WANT TO END ON A MORE POSITIVE NOTE
PaulSnelgrove_2011G AND SO THE GRAND CHALLENGE THEN IS TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE PRESERVE WHAT 'S LEFT BECAUSE THERE IS STILL SPECTACULAR BEAUTY AND THE OCEANS ARE SO PRODUCTIVE THERE 'S SO MUCH GOING ON IN THERE THAT 'S OF RELEVANCE TO HUMANS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO EVEN FROM A SELFISH PERSPECTIVE TRY TO DO BETTER THAN WE HAVE IN THE PAST SO WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THOSE HOT SPOTS AND DO OUR BEST TO PROTECT THEM
PaulSnelgrove_2011G WHEN WE LOOK AT PICTURES LIKE THIS THEY TAKE OUR BREATH AWAY IN ADDITION TO HELPING TO GIVE US BREATH
PaulSnelgrove_2011G CENSUS SCIENTISTS WORKED IN THE RAIN THEY WORKED IN THE COLD THEY WORKED UNDER WATER AND THEY WORKED ABOVE WATER TRYING TO ILLUMINATE THE WONDROUS DISCOVERY THE STILL VAST UNKNOWN THE SPECTACULAR ADAPTATIONS THAT WE SEE IN OCEAN LIFE
PaulSnelgrove_2011G SO WHETHER YOU 'RE A YAK HERDER LIVING IN THE MOUNTAINS OF CHILE WHETHER YOU 'RE A STOCKBROKER IN NEW YORK CITY OR WHETHER YOU 'RE A TEDSTER LIVING IN EDINBURGH THE OCEANS MATTER AND AS THE OCEANS GO SO SHALL WE THANKS FOR LISTENING
