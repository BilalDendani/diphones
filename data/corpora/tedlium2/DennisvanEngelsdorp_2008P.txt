DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO DO IS JUST REALLY QUICKLY IS JUST SORT OF NOD TO THE PERSON ON YOUR RIGHT AND THEN NOD TO THE PERSON ON YOUR LEFT
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P NOW CHANCES ARE
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P OVER THE LAST WINTER IF YOU HAD BEEN A BEEHIVE EITHER YOU OR ONE OF THE TWO PEOPLE YOU JUST NODDED AT WOULD HAVE DIED
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P NOW THAT'S AN AWFUL LOT OF BEES
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW WE HAVE LOST OVER THIRTY PERCENT OF THE COLONIES OR WE ESTIMATE WE'VE LOST THIRTY PERCENT OF THE COLONIES OVER THE WINTER
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P NOW THAT'S A LOT A LOT OF BEES AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P OF THOSE LOSSES ARE BECAUSE OF THINGS WE KNOW WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE THESE VARROA MITES THAT HAVE INTRODUCED AND CAUSED A LOT OF LOSSES
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND WE ALSO HAVE THIS NEW PHENOMENON WHICH I TALKED ABOUT LAST YEAR COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER AND HERE WE SEE A PICTURE ON TOP OF A HILL IN CENTRAL VALLEY LAST DECEMBER
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND BELOW YOU CAN SEE ALL THESE OUT YARDS OR TEMPORARY YARDS WHERE THE COLONIES ARE BROUGHT IN UNTIL FEBRUARY AND THEN THEY'RE SHIPPED OUT TO THE
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND ONE DOCUMENTARY WRITER WHO WAS HERE AND LOOKED AT THIS TWO MONTHS AFTER I WAS HERE DESCRIBED THIS NOT AS BEEHIVES BUT AS A GRAVEYARD WITH THESE EMPTY WHITE BOXES
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P WITH NO BEES LEFT IN THEM NOW I'M GOING TO SUM UP A YEAR 'S WORTH OF WORK IN TWO SENTENCES TO SAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE CAUSE OF THIS IS AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT IT'S AS IF THE BEES HAVE CAUGHT A FLU
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND THIS FLU HAS WIPED THROUGH THE POPULATION OF BEES IN SOME CASES AND IN FACT IN MOST CASES IN ONE YEAR THIS
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P FLU WAS CAUSED BY A NEW VIRUS TO US OR NEWLY IDENTIFIED BY US CALLED ISRAELI ACUTE PARALYSIS VIRUS
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P IT WAS CALLED THAT BECAUSE A GUY IN ISRAEL FIRST FOUND IT AND HE NOW REGRETS PROFOUNDLY CALLING IT THAT DISEASE BECAUSE OF COURSE THERE'S THE IMPLICATION BUT WE THINK THIS VIRUS IS PRETTY UBIQUITOUS
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P IT'S ALSO PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE BEES SOMETIMES CATCH OTHER VIRUSES OR OTHER FLUS AND SO THE QUESTION WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING WITH
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND THE QUESTION THAT KEEPS US UP AT NIGHT IS WHY HAVE THE BEES SUDDENLY BECOME SO SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS FLU AND WHY ARE THEY
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P TO THESE OTHER DISEASES AND WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT YET AND WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT WE THINK PERHAPS IT'S A COMBINATION OF FACTORS WE KNOW FROM THE WORK OF A VERY LARGE AND DYNAMIC WORKING TEAM
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE FINDING A LOT OF DIFFERENT PESTICIDES IN THE HIVE AND SURPRISINGLY SOMETIMES THE HEALTHIEST HIVES HAVE THE MOST PESTICIDES
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P THE ONE HALF THAT DOESN'T HAVE A QUEEN THEY CAN BUY A QUEEN IT COMES IN THE MAIL IT CAN COME FROM AUSTRALIA OR HAWAII OR FLORIDA AND YOU CAN INTRODUCE THAT QUEEN AND IN FACT AMERICA
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P WAS THE FIRST COUNTRY THAT EVER DID MAIL DELIVERY QUEENS AND IN FACT IT'S PART OF THE POSTAL CODE THAT YOU HAVE TO DELIVER QUEENS BY MAIL IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH BEES IN THIS COUNTRY
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P IF YOU DON'T JUST WANT A QUEEN YOU CAN BUY ACTUALLY A THREE POUND PACKAGE OF BEES WHICH COMES IN THE MAIL AND OF COURSE THE POSTAL OFFICE IS ALWAYS VERY CONCERNED WHEN THEY GET YOU KNOW YOUR THREE POUND PACKAGES OF BEES AND YOU CAN INSTALL THIS IN
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P YOUR HIVE AND REPLACE THAT DEAD OUT SO IT MEANS THAT BEEKEEPERS ARE VERY GOOD AT REPLACING DEAD OUTS AND SO THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO COVER THOSE LOSSES
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P SO EVEN THOUGH WE'VE LOST THIRTY PERCENT OF THE COLONIES EVERY YEAR THE SAME NUMBER OF COLONIES HAVE EXISTED IN THE COUNTRY AT ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR MILLION COLONIES
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P NOW THOSE LOSSES ARE TRAGIC ON MANY FRONTS AND ONE OF THOSE FRONTS IS FOR THE BEEKEEPER
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT BEEKEEPERS FIRST BECAUSE BEEKEEPERS ARE AMONG THE MOST FASCINATING PEOPLE YOU'LL EVER MEET IF THIS WAS A GROUP OF BEEKEEPERS YOU WOULD HAVE EVERYONE FROM
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P THE CARD CARRYING NRA MEMBER WHO 'S YOU KNOW LIVE FREE OR DIE TO THE YOU KNOW THE SELF EXPRESSED QUIRKY SAN FRANCISCO BACKYARD PIG FARMER AND
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P YOU GET ALL OF THESE PEOPLE
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P IN THE SAME ROOM AND THEY'RE ALL ENGAGED AND THEY'RE GETTING ALONG AND THEY'RE ALL THERE BECAUSE OF THE PASSION FOR BEES
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P NOW THERE'S ANOTHER PART OF THAT COMMUNITY WHICH ARE THE COMMERCIAL BEEKEEPERS THE ONES WHO MAKE THEIR LIVELIHOOD FROM BEEKEEPING ALONE AND THESE TEND TO BE SOME OF THE MOST INDEPENDENT TENACIOUS
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P INTUITIVE YOU KNOW INVENTIVE PEOPLE YOU WILL EVER MEET THEY'RE JUST FASCINATING AND THEY'RE LIKE THAT ALL OVER THE WORLD I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING IN HAITI JUST FOR TWO WEEKS EARLIER THIS YEAR
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND HAITI IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN THERE IS JUST A TRAGEDY I MEAN THERE MAY BE ONE HUNDRED EXPLANATIONS FOR WHY HAITI IS THE IMPOVERISHED NATION IT IS BUT THERE IS NO EXCUSE TO SEE THAT SORT OF SQUALOR BUT YOU MEET THIS BEEKEEPER AND I MET THIS BEEKEEPER HERE
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND HE IS ONE OF THE MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE BEEKEEPERS I'VE EVER MET NO FORMAL EDUCATION BUT VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE WE NEEDED BEESWAX FOR A PROJECT WE WERE WORKING ON HE WAS SO CAPABLE HE WAS ABLE TO RENDER THE NICEST BLOCK OF BEESWAX I HAVE EVER SEEN FROM
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P COW DUNG TIN CANS AND HIS VEIL WHICH HE USED AS A SCREENING RIGHT IN THIS MEADOW AND SO THAT INGENUITY IS INSPIRING WE ALSO HAVE DAVE HACKENBERG WHO IS THE POSTER CHILD OF CCD
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P HE 'S THE ONE WHO FIRST IDENTIFIED THIS CONDITION AND RAISED THE ALARM BELLS AND HE HAS A HISTORY OF THESE TRUCKS AND HE 'S MOVED THESE BEES UP AND DOWN THE COAST AND A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TRUCKS AND MOVING BEES AND THAT BEING BAD BUT WE'VE
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P DONE THAT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS USED TO MOVE BEES UP AND DOWN THE NILE ON RAFTS SO THIS IDEA OF A MOVABLE BEE FORCE IS NOT NEW AT ALL
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND ONE OF OUR REAL WORRIES WITH COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER IS THE FACT THAT IT COSTS SO MUCH MONEY TO REPLACE THOSE DEAD OUT COLONIES
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P YOU CAN'T SURVIVE THREE YEARS IN A ROW AND WE'RE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT LOSING THIS SEGMENT OF OUR INDUSTRY
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR MANY FRONTS AND ONE OF THEM IS BECAUSE OF THAT CULTURE THAT'S IN AGRICULTURE AND THESE MIGRATORY BEEKEEPERS ARE THE LAST NOMADS OF AMERICA
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P YOU KNOW THEY PICK UP THEIR HIVES THEY MOVE THEIR FAMILIES ONCE OR TWICE IN A YEAR AND IF YOU LOOK AT FLORIDA IN DADE CITY FLORIDA THAT'S WHERE ALL THE PENNSYLVANIA BEEKEEPERS GO
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND THEN TWENTY MILES DOWN THE ROAD IS GROVELAND AND THAT'S WHERE ALL THE WISCONSIN BEEKEEPERS GO AND IF YOU'RE EVER IN CENTRAL VALLEY IN FEBRUARY
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P RIGHT THERE AND IT'S A GREAT EXPERIENCE AND I REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO DROP IN AT THAT DINER DURING THAT TIME BECAUSE THAT'S
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P QUITE ESSENTIAL AMERICAN EXPERIENCE AND WE SEE THESE FAMILIES THESE NOMADIC FAMILIES YOU KNOW FATHER TO SON FATHER TO SON
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND THESE GUYS ARE HURTING AND THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO ASK FOR HELP ALTHOUGH THEY ARE THE MOST HELPFUL PEOPLE EVER IF THERE'S ONE GUY WHO LOSES ALL HIS BEES BECAUSE OF A TRUCK OVERHAUL
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P OF COURSE THE REAL IMPORTANCE FOR BEES IS NOT THE HONEY AND ALTHOUGH I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU ALL USE HONEY I MEAN IT'S THE MOST ETHICAL SWEETENER AND YOU KNOW IT'S A DYNAMIC AND FUN SWEETENER
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P NOW I WANT TO JUST ILLUSTRATE THAT IN THE FACT THAT IF WE LOOK AT THE BREAKFAST I HAD YESTERDAY MORNING A LITTLE CRANBERRY JUICE SOME FRUITS SOME GRANOLA I SHOULD HAVE HAD WHOLEWHEAT BREAD I REALIZED BUT YOU KNOW JAM
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P ON MY WONDERBREAD AND SOME COFFEE AND HAD WE TAKEN OUT ALL THOSE INGREDIENTS EXCEPT FOR THE ALMONDS I WASN'T GOING TO PICK OUT FROM THE
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P IF WE HAD TAKEN OUT ALL THOSE INGREDIENTS THE BEES HAD INDIRECTLY OR DIRECTLY POLLINATED WE WOULDN'T HAVE MUCH ON OUR PLATE SO IF WE DID NOT HAVE BEES IT'S NOT LIKE WE WOULD STARVE BUT CLEARLY
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P OUR DIET WOULD BE DIMINISHED
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P THEY GET PAID FOR THEIR SERVICES THEY GET PAID BY POLLEN AND NECTAR TO MOVE THAT MALE SPERM THE POLLEN FROM FLOWER TO FLOWER AND THERE ARE FLOWERS THAT ARE SELF
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P THAT MEANS THEY CAN'T THE POLLEN IN THEIR BLOOM CAN'T FERTILIZE THEMSELVES SO IN AN APPLE ORCHARD FOR INSTANCE YOU'LL HAVE ROWS OF TEN APPLES OF ONE VARIETY AND THEN YOU HAVE
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P ANOTHER APPLE TREE THAT'S A DIFFERENT TYPE OF POLLEN AND BEES ARE VERY FAITHFUL WHEN THEY'RE OUT POLLINATING OR GATHERING POLLEN FROM ONE FLOWER THEY STAY TO THAT CROP EXCLUSIVELY IN ORDER TO HELP GENERATE AND OF COURSE
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P MADE TO CARRY THIS POLLEN THEY BUILD UP A STATIC ELECTRIC CHARGE AND THE POLLEN JUMPS ON THEM AND HELPS SPREAD THAT POLLEN FROM BLOOM TO
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P HOWEVER HONEYBEES ARE A MINORITY HONEYBEES ARE NOT NATIVE TO AMERICA THEY WERE INTRODUCED WITH THE COLONIALISTS AND THERE ARE ACTUALLY MORE SPECIES OF BEES THAN THERE ARE MAMMALS AND BIRDS COMBINED
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P IN PENNSYLVANIA ALONE WE HAVE BEEN SURVEYING BEES FOR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AND VERY INTENSELY IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WE HAVE IDENTIFIED OVER FOUR HUNDRED SPECIES OF BEES IN PENNSYLVANIA
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P BUT IT DOES I THINK SUGGEST THAT SOMETHING 'S WRONG WITH THE POLLINATOR FORCE AND THESE BEES ARE FASCINATING WE HAVE BUMBLEBEES ON THE TOP AND BUMBLEBEES ARE WHAT WE CALL EUSOCIAL THEY'RE NOT TRULY SOCIAL BECAUSE ONLY THE QUEEN IS OVER WINTER
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P WE ALSO HAVE THE SWEAT BEES AND THESE ARE LITTLE GEMS FLYING AROUND THEY'RE LIKE TINY LITTLE FLIES AND THEY FLY AROUND AND THEN YOU HAVE ANOTHER TYPE OF BEE WHICH WE CALL KLEPTOPARASITES
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P WHAT'S THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR MURDERING
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P OKAY
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P WHAT THESE BEES DO IS
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P THEY SIT THERE THESE SOLITARY
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P THEY DRILL A HOLE IN THE GROUND OR DRILL A HOLE IN A BRANCH AND THEY COLLECT POLLEN AND MAKE IT INTO A BALL AND THEY LAY AN EGG ON IT WELL THESE BEES HANG OUT AT THAT
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND THEY WAIT FOR THAT MOTHER TO FLY AWAY THEY GO IN EAT THE EGG AND LAY THEIR OWN EGG THERE SO THEY DON'T DO ANY WORK AND SO
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P IN FACT IF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THESE KLEPTOPARASITIC BEES YOU KNOW THAT YOUR ENVIRONMENT IS HEALTHY BECAUSE THEY'RE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN BEES AND IN FACT THERE IS NOW A RED LIST OF
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P THAT WE'RE WORRIED HAVE DISAPPEARED AND ON TOP OF THAT LIST ARE A LOT OF THESE KLEPTOPARASITES BUT ALSO THESE BUMBLEBEES AND IN FACT
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P IF YOU GUYS LIVE ON THE WEST COAST GO TO THESE WEBSITES HERE AND THEY'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK FOR SOME OF THESE BUMBLEBEES BECAUSE WE THINK SOME HAVE GONE EXTINCT OR SOME THE POPULATION HAS DECLINED
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P ARE NOT THE ONLY IMPORTANT FACTOR HERE THERE ARE OTHER ANIMALS THAT POLLINATE LIKE BATS AND BATS ARE IN TROUBLE TOO
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND I'M GLAD I'M A BEE MAN AND NOT A BAT MAN BECAUSE THERE'S NO MONEY TO RESEARCH THE BAT PROBLEMS AND BATS ARE DYING AT AN EXTRAORDINARY
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P WHITE NOSE SYNDROME HAS WIPED OUT POPULATIONS OF BATS IF THERE'S A CAVE IN NEW YORK THAT HAD FIFTEEN THOUSAND BATS IN IT AND THERE ARE ONE THOUSAND LEFT THAT'S LIKE SAN FRANCISCO
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P NATURE DEFICIT DISORDER AND THAT IS THAT I THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR SOCIETY IS WE FORGOT OUR CONNECTION WITH NATURE
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND I THINK IF WE RECONNECT TO NATURE WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE THE RESOURCES AND THAT INTEREST TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND I THINK THAT THERE IS AN EASY CURE FOR NDD AND THAT IS MAKE MEADOWS AND NOT LAWNS AND I THINK WE HAVE LOST OUR CONNECTION AND THIS IS A WONDERFUL WAY OF RECONNECTING TO OUR ENVIRONMENT
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF LIVING BY A MEADOW FOR THE LAST LITTLE WHILE AND IT IS TERRIBLY ENGAGING AND IF WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF LAWNS IT'S ACTUALLY RATHER TRAGIC
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P IT USED TO BE TWO THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THAT A LAWN WAS A SYMBOL OF PRESTIGE AND SO IT WAS ONLY THE VERY RICH THAT COULD KEEP THESE GREEN ACTUALLY DESERTS THEY'RE TOTALLY
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P IN FACT YOU KNOW THE WHITE HOUSE USED TO HAVE SHEEP IN FRONT IN ORDER TO HELP FUND THE WAR EFFORT IN WORLD WAR I WHICH PROBABLY IS NOT A BAD IDEA IT WOULDN'T BE A BAD IDEA I WANT TO SAY THIS NOT BECAUSE I'M OPPOSED COMPLETELY TO MOWING LAWNS I THINK THAT THERE IS PERHAPS SOME
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P ADVANTAGE TO KEEPING LAWNS AT A LIMITED SCALE AND I THINK WE'RE ENCOURAGED TO DO THAT BUT I ALSO WANT TO REINFORCE SOME OF THE IDEAS WE'VE HEARD HERE BECAUSE HAVING A MEADOW OR LIVING BY A MEADOW IS TRANSFORMATIONAL
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P THAT IT IS AMAZING THAT CONNECTION WE CAN HAVE WITH WHAT'S THERE THESE MILKWEED PLANTS HAVE GROWN UP IN MY MEADOW OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS ADD TO WATCH THE DIFFERENT PLANTS OR INSECTS THAT COME TO THESE FLOWERS
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P TO WATCH THAT AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU KNOW THIS RELATIONSHIP YOU CAN HAVE WITH WINE THIS COMPANION YOU CAN HAVE AS IT MATURES AND AS IT HAS THESE DIFFERENT FRAGRANCES AND THIS IS A COMPANION
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP THAT NEVER DRIES UP YOU NEVER RUN OUT OF THAT COMPANION AS YOU DRINK THIS WINE TOO AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT THAT NOW NOT ALL OF US HAVE MEADOWS OR LAWNS THAT WE CAN CONVERT AND SO YOU CAN ALWAYS OF COURSE
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P GROW A MEADOW IN A POT
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P BEES APPARENTLY CAN BE THE GATEWAY TO YOU KNOW OTHER THINGS SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU SHOULD PLANT A MEADOW OF POT BUT A POT IN A MEADOW
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P BUT YOU CAN ALSO HAVE THIS GREAT COMMUNITY OF CITY OR BUILDING TOP BEEKEEPERS THESE BEEKEEPERS THAT LIVE THIS IS IN PARIS
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P WHERE THESE BEEKEEPERS LIVE AND EVERYONE SHOULD OPEN A BEEHIVE BECAUSE IT IS THE MOST AMAZING INCREDIBLE THING AND IF WE WANT TO CURE OURSELVES OF NDD OR NATURE DEFICIT DISORDER
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P I THINK THIS IS A GREAT WAY OF DOING IT GET A BEEHIVE AND GROW A MEADOW AND WATCH THAT LIFE COME BACK INTO YOUR LIFE
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND SO WITH THAT I THINK THAT WHAT WE CAN DO IF WE DO THIS WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT OUR FUTURE OUR MORE PERFECT FUTURE INCLUDES BEEKEEPERS AND IT INCLUDES BEES
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P AND IT INCLUDES THOSE MEADOWS AND THAT JOURNEY THAT JOURNEY OF TRANSFORMATION THAT OCCURS AS YOU GROW YOUR MEADOW AND AS YOU KEEP YOUR BEES OR YOU WATCH THOSE NATIVE BEES THERE
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P IS AN EXTREMELY EXCITING ONE AND I HOPE THAT YOU EXPERIENCE IT AND I HOPE YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT ONE DAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE
