AnandaShankar_2009I BUT NOTHING NOTHING PREPARED ME FOR WHAT I WAS TO HEAR ON THE FIRST OF JULY TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT I HEARD THE WORD CARCINOMA YES BREAST CANCER AS I SAT DUMBSTRUCK IN MY DOCTOR 'S OFFICE
AnandaShankar_2009I I HEARD OTHER WORDS CANCER STAGE GRADE UNTIL THEN CANCER WAS THE ZODIAC SIGN OF MY FRIEND STAGE WAS WHAT I PERFORMED ON AND GRADES WERE WHAT I GOT IN SCHOOL
AnandaShankar_2009I THAT DAY I REALIZED I HAD AN UNWELCOME UNINVITED NEW LIFE PARTNER
AnandaShankar_2009I I REALIZED THEN THAT I WHO THOUGHT I HAD COMPLETE CONTROL OF MY LIFE HAD CONTROL OF ONLY THREE THINGS
AnandaShankar_2009I WANTING TO GO TO A PLACE OF HEALING HEALTH AND HAPPINESS I WANTED TO GO FROM WHERE I WAS TO WHERE I WANTED TO BE
AnandaShankar_2009I BUT TO GO FROM WHERE I WAS TO WHERE I WANTED TO BE I NEEDED SOMETHING I NEEDED AN ANCHOR AN IMAGE A PEG TO PEG THIS PROCESS ON SO THAT I COULD GO FROM THERE AND I FOUND THAT IN MY DANCE
AnandaShankar_2009I MY DANCE MY STRENGTH MY ENERGY MY PASSION MY VERY LIFE BREATH
AnandaShankar_2009I BUT IT WASN 'T EASY BELIEVE ME IT DEFINITELY WASN 'T EASY HOW DO YOU KEEP CHEER WHEN YOU GO FROM BEAUTIFUL TO BALD IN THREE DAYS
AnandaShankar_2009I SO I WOULD DRAG MYSELF INTO MY DANCE STUDIO BODY MIND AND SPIRIT EVERY DAY INTO MY DANCE STUDIO AND LEARN EVERYTHING I LEARNED WHEN I WAS FOUR ALL OVER AGAIN REWORKED RELEARNED REGROUPED IT WAS EXCRUCIATINGLY PAINFUL BUT I DID IT DIFFICULT
AnandaShankar_2009I I FOCUSED ON MY MUDRAS ON THE IMAGERY OF MY DANCE ON THE POETRY AND THE METAPHOR AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE DANCE ITSELF AND SLOWLY I MOVED OUT OF THAT MISERABLE STATE OF MIND
AnandaShankar_2009I ASTRIDE HER LION INTO THE BATTLEFIELD TO DESTROY MAHISHASUR
AnandaShankar_2009I THE PASSION OF MY TRAINING I BROUGHT LASER SHARP FOCUS INTO MY DANCE LASER SHARP FOCUS TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT I DANCED A FEW WEEKS AFTER SURGERY
AnandaShankar_2009I I DANCED THROUGH CHEMO AND RADIATION CYCLES MUCH TO THE DISMAY OF MY ONCOLOGIST I DANCED BETWEEN CHEMO AND RADIATION CYCLES AND BADGERED HIM TO FIT IT TO MY PERFORMING DANCE SCHEDULE
AnandaShankar_2009I WHAT I HAD DONE IS I HAD TUNED OUT OF CANCER AND TUNED INTO MY DANCE
AnandaShankar_2009I YES CANCER HAS JUST BEEN ONE PAGE IN MY LIFE
AnandaShankar_2009I MY STORY IS A STORY OF OVERCOMING SETBACKS OBSTACLES AND CHALLENGES THAT LIFE THROWS AT YOU
