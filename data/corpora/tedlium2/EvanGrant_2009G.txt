EvanGrant_2009G CREATIVE TECHNOLOGIST AND THE FOCUS OF MY WORK IS ON PUBLIC INSTALLATIONS AND ONE OF MY DRIVING PASSIONS IS THIS IDEA OF EXPLORING NATURE AND TRYING TO FIND HIDDEN DATA WITHIN NATURE
EvanGrant_2009G AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE IS THIS LATENT POTENTIAL EVERYWHERE ALL AROUND US EVERYTHING GIVES OUT SOME KIND OF DATA WHETHER IT'S
EvanGrant_2009G SMELL OR VIBRATION AND THROUGH MY WORK I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO HARNESS AND UNVEIL THIS AND
EvanGrant_2009G THIS BASICALLY LEAD ME TO A SUBJECT CALLED CYMATICS NOW CYMATICS IS THE PROCESS OF VISUALIZING SOUND BY BASICALLY VIBRATING A MEDIUM SUCH AS SAND OR WATER AS YOU CAN SEE
EvanGrant_2009G SO IF WE HAVE A QUICK LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF CYMATICS BEGINNING WITH THE OBSERVATIONS OF RESONANCE BY DA VINCI GALILEO THE ENGLISH SCIENTIST ROBERT HOOK
EvanGrant_2009G AND THEN ERNEST CHLADNI AND HE CREATED AND EXPERIMENT USING A METAL PLATE COVERING IT WITH SAND AND THEN BOWING IT TO
EvanGrant_2009G FROM THIS THE NEXT PERSON TO EXPLORE THIS FIELD WAS A GENTLEMAN CALLED HANS JENNY IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND HE ACTUALLY COINED THE TERM CYMATICS
EvanGrant_2009G THE FREQUENCIES INCREASE SO DO THE COMPLEXITIES
EvanGrant_2009G SO WHAT EXCITES ME ABOUT CYMATICS WELL FOR ME CYMATICS IS AN ALMOST MAGICAL TOOL IT'S LIKE A
EvanGrant_2009G WE CAN ALSO USE CYMATICS FOR HEALING AND EDUCATION THIS IS AN INSTALLATION DEVELOPED WITH SCHOOL CHILDREN WHERE THEIR HANDS ARE TRACKED AND IT ALLOWS THEM TO CONTROL AND POSITION CYMATIC PATTERNS AND THE REFLECTIONS THAT ARE CAUSED BY
EvanGrant_2009G WE CAN ALSO USE CYMATICS AS A BEAUTIFUL NATURAL ART FORM THIS IMAGE HERE IS CREATED FROM A SNIPPET OF BEETHOVEN 'S NINTH SYMPHONY PLAYING THROUGH A CYMATIC DEVICE SO IT KIND OF FLIPS THINGS ON IT'S HEAD
EvanGrant_2009G AND THIS IS PINK FLOYD 'S MACHINE PLAYING IN REAL TIME THROUGH
EvanGrant_2009G CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT THAT SOUND DOES HAVE FORM AND WE'VE SEEN THAT IT CAN AFFECT MATTER AND CAUSE FORM WITHIN MATTER THEN SORT OF
EvanGrant_2009G TAKE A LEAP AND THINK ABOUT THE UNIVERSE FORMING AND THINK ABOUT THE IMMENSE SOUND OF THE UNIVERSE FORMING AND IF WE KIND OF PONDER ON THAT THEN PERHAPS CYMATICS HAD AN INFLUENCE
EvanGrant_2009G ON THE FORMATION OF THE UNIVERSE ITSELF AND HERE IS SOME EYE CANDY FOR YOU FROM A RANGE OF DIY SCIENTISTS AND ARTISTS FROM ALL OVER THE GLOBE AND
EvanGrant_2009G COLLECTIVELY WE CAN BUILD A GLOBAL COMMUNITY WE CAN INSPIRE EACH OTHER AND WE CAN EVOLVE THIS EXPLORATION OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THINGS NOT SEEN THANK YOU
