ApolloRobbins_2013G@12.82:15.87 THINK IT 'S POSSIBLE TO CONTROL SOMEONE 'S ATTENTION
ApolloRobbins_2013G@15.87:21.93 EVEN MORE THAN THAT WHAT ABOUT PREDICTING HUMAN BEHAVIOR
ApolloRobbins_2013G@21.93:36.75 I THINK THOSE ARE INTERESTING IDEAS IF YOU COULD I MEAN FOR ME THAT WOULD BE THE PERFECT SUPERPOWER ACTUALLY KIND OF AN EVIL WAY OF APPROACHING IT BUT FOR MYSELF IN THE PAST I 'VE SPENT THE LAST TWENTY YEARS STUDYING HUMAN BEHAVIOR FROM A RATHER UNORTHODOX WAY PICKING POCKETS
ApolloRobbins_2013G@36.75:51.03 WHEN WE THINK OF MISDIRECTION WE THINK OF SOMETHING AS LOOKING OFF TO THE SIDE WHEN ACTUALLY IT 'S OFTEN THE THINGS THAT ARE RIGHT IN FRONT OF US THAT ARE THE HARDEST THINGS TO SEE THE THINGS THAT YOU LOOK AT EVERY DAY THAT YOU 'RE BLINDED TO FOR EXAMPLE HOW MANY OF YOU STILL HAVE YOUR CELL PHONES ON YOU RIGHT NOW
ApolloRobbins_2013G@57.75:66.54 NOW YOU 'VE LOOKED AT THEM PROBABLY A FEW TIMES TODAY BUT I 'M GOING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT THEM WITHOUT LOOKING AT YOUR CELL PHONE DIRECTLY YET CAN YOU REMEMBER THE ICON IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER
ApolloRobbins_2013G@66.54:70.5 BRING THEM OUT CHECK AND SEE HOW ACCURATE YOU WERE
ApolloRobbins_2013G@74.24:78.14 HOW 'D YOU DO SHOW OF HANDS DID WE GET
ApolloRobbins_2013G@94.94:109.06 CLOSE YOUR EYES I REALIZE I 'M ASKING YOU TO DO THAT WHILE YOU JUST HEARD THERE 'S A PICKPOCKET IN THE ROOM BUT CLOSE YOUR EYES NOW YOU 'VE BEEN WATCHING ME FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED WHAT AM I WEARING
ApolloRobbins_2013G@125.94:140.04 THEY HAVE FANCY MODELS OF ATTENTION POSNER 'S TRINITY MODEL OF ATTENTION FOR ME I LIKE TO THINK OF IT VERY SIMPLE LIKE A SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM IT 'S KIND OF LIKE YOU HAVE ALL THESE FANCY SENSORS AND INSIDE YOUR BRAIN IS A LITTLE SECURITY GUARD FOR ME I LIKE TO CALL HIM FRANK
ApolloRobbins_2013G@140.04:149.8 SO FRANK IS SITTING AT A DESK HE 'S GOT ALL SORTS OF COOL INFORMATION IN FRONT OF HIM HIGH TECH EQUIPMENT HE 'S GOT CAMERAS HE 'S GOT A LITTLE PHONE THAT HE CAN PICK UP LISTEN TO THE EARS
ApolloRobbins_2013G@149.8:161.26 ALL THESE SENSES ALL THESE PERCEPTIONS BUT ATTENTION IS WHAT STEERS YOUR PERCEPTIONS IS WHAT CONTROLS YOUR REALITY IT 'S THE GATEWAY TO THE MIND IF YOU DON 'T ATTEND TO SOMETHING YOU CAN 'T BE AWARE OF IT
ApolloRobbins_2013G@161.26:172.38 BUT IRONICALLY YOU CAN ATTEND TO SOMETHING WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF IT THAT 'S WHY THERE 'S THE COCKTAIL EFFECT WHEN YOU 'RE IN A PARTY YOU 'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH SOMEONE AND YET YOU CAN RECOGNIZE YOUR NAME AND YOU DIDN 'T EVEN REALIZE YOU WERE LISTENING TO THAT
ApolloRobbins_2013G@180.29:189.34 CONTROL HOW YOU SPEND YOUR ATTENTION IF I COULD MAYBE STEAL YOUR ATTENTION THROUGH A DISTRACTION NOW INSTEAD OF DOING IT LIKE MISDIRECTION AND THROWING IT OFF TO THE SIDE
ApolloRobbins_2013G@189.34:201.24 INSTEAD WHAT I CHOOSE TO FOCUS ON IS FRANK TO BE ABLE TO PLAY WITH THE FRANK INSIDE YOUR HEAD YOUR LITTLE SECURITY GUARD AND GET YOU INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON YOUR EXTERNAL SENSES JUST TO GO INTERNAL FOR A SECOND
ApolloRobbins_2013G@201.24:211.37 SO IF I ASK YOU TO ACCESS A MEMORY LIKE WHAT IS THAT WHAT JUST HAPPENED DO YOU HAVE A WALLET DO YOU HAVE AN AMERICAN EXPRESS IN YOUR WALLET AND WHEN I DO THAT YOUR FRANK TURNS AROUND
ApolloRobbins_2013G@211.37:218.75 HE ACCESSES THE FILE HE HAS TO REWIND THE TAPE AND WHAT 'S INTERESTING IS HE CAN 'T REWIND THE TAPE AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE 'S TRYING TO PROCESS NEW DATA
ApolloRobbins_2013G@218.75:231.87 NOW I MEAN THIS SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD THEORY BUT I COULD TALK FOR A LONG TIME AND TELL YOU LOTS OF THINGS AND THEY MAY BE TRUE A PORTION OF THEM BUT I THINK IT 'S BETTER IF I TRIED TO SHOW THAT TO YOU HERE LIVE SO IF I COME DOWN I 'M GOING TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF SHOPPING JUST HOLD STILL WHERE YOU ARE
ApolloRobbins_2013G@345.92:357.75 GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT OFF NOW LET 'S TRY THAT AGAIN HOLD YOUR HAND OUT FLAT OPEN IT UP ALL THE WAY PUT YOUR HAND UP A LITTLE BIT HIGHER BUT WATCH IT CLOSE THERE JOE SEE IF I DID IT SLOWLY IT 'D BE BACK ON YOUR SHOULDER
ApolloRobbins_2013G@420.07:431.6 IT GO YEAH IT 'S FUNNY WE 'VE GOT A LITTLE GUY HE 'S UNION HE WORKS UP THERE ALL DAY IF I DID IT SLOWLY IF IT GOES STRAIGHTAWAY IT LANDS DOWN BY YOUR POCKET I BELIEVE IS IT IN THIS POCKET SIR NO DON 'T REACH IN YOUR POCKET THAT 'S A DIFFERENT SHOW
ApolloRobbins_2013G@485.72:493.45 SO SAME QUESTION I ASKED YOU BEFORE BUT THIS TIME YOU DON 'T HAVE TO CLOSE YOUR EYES WHAT AM I WEARING
ApolloRobbins_2013G@502.85:515.51 ATTENTION IS A POWERFUL THING LIKE I SAID IT SHAPES YOUR REALITY SO I GUESS I 'D LIKE TO POSE THAT QUESTION TO YOU IF YOU COULD CONTROL SOMEBODY 'S ATTENTION WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH IT THANK YOU
