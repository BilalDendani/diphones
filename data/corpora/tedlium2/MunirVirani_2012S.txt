MunirVirani_2012S@19.94:22.81 THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND SPECIES OF BIRDS
MunirVirani_2012S@28.67:30.87 WHEN YOU SEE A VULTURE LIKE THIS
MunirVirani_2012S@30.88:40.87 THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO YOUR MIND IS THESE ARE DISGUSTING UGLY GREEDY CREATURES THAT ARE JUST AFTER YOUR FLESH ASSOCIATED WITH POLITICIANS
MunirVirani_2012S@56.11:59.51 FIRST OF ALL WHY DO THEY HAVE SUCH A BAD PRESS
MunirVirani_2012S@60.03:72.04 WHEN CHARLES DARWIN WENT ACROSS THE ATLANTIC IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO ON THE BEAGLE HE SAW THE TURKEY VULTURE AND HE SAID THESE ARE DISGUSTING BIRDS WITH BALD SCARLET HEADS
MunirVirani_2012S@72.19:74.51 THAT ARE FORMED TO REVEL IN PUTRIDITY
MunirVirani_2012S@75.83:79.26 YOU COULD NOT GET A WORSE INSULT AND THAT FROM CHARLES DARWIN
MunirVirani_2012S@93.06:95.96 MORE RECENTLY IF YOU 'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE KENYAN PRESS
MunirVirani_2012S@108.43:112.26 BUT I WANT TO CHALLENGE THAT I WANT TO CHALLENGE THAT DO YOU KNOW WHY
MunirVirani_2012S@112.63:114.4 BECAUSE MPS
MunirVirani_2012S@115.75:117.62 DO NOT KEEP THE ENVIRONMENT CLEAN
MunirVirani_2012S@151.25:159.5 AND THEN THE OLD WORLD VULTURES WHERE WE HAVE SIXTEEN SPECIES FROM THESE SIXTEEN ELEVEN OF THEM ARE FACING A HIGH RISK OF EXTINCTION
MunirVirani_2012S@160.03:162.39 SO WHY ARE VULTURES IMPORTANT
MunirVirani_2012S@162.92:181.47 FIRST OF ALL THEY PROVIDE VITAL ECOLOGICAL SERVICES THEY CLEAN UP THEY 'RE OUR NATURAL GARBAGE COLLECTORS THEY CLEAN UP CARCASSES RIGHT TO THE BONE THEY HELP TO KILL ALL THE BACTERIA THEY HELP ABSORB ANTHRAX THAT WOULD OTHERWISE SPREAD AND CAUSE HUGE LIVESTOCK LOSSES AND DISEASES IN OTHER ANIMALS
MunirVirani_2012S@182.11:192.7 RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE NO VULTURES CARCASSES TAKE UP TO THREE TO FOUR TIMES TO DECOMPOSE AND THIS HAS HUGE RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE SPREAD OF DISEASES
MunirVirani_2012S@193.32:200 VULTURES ALSO HAVE TREMENDOUS HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE THEY HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN CULTURE
MunirVirani_2012S@200.16:209.53 NEKHBET WAS THE SYMBOL OF THE PROTECTOR AND THE MOTHERHOOD AND TOGETHER WITH THE COBRA SYMBOLIZED THE UNITY BETWEEN UPPER AND LOWER EGYPT
MunirVirani_2012S@210.26:216.69 IN HINDU MYTHOLOGY JATAYU WAS THE VULTURE GOD AND HE RISKED HIS LIFE
MunirVirani_2012S@216.95:221.6 IN ORDER TO SAVE THE GODDESS SITA FROM THE TEN HEADED DEMON RAVANA
MunirVirani_2012S@221.98:234.88 IN TIBETAN CULTURE THEY ARE PERFORMING VERY IMPORTANT SKY BURIALS IN PLACES LIKE TIBET THERE ARE NO PLACES TO BURY THE DEAD OR WOOD TO CREMATE THEM SO THESE VULTURES PROVIDE A NATURAL DISPOSAL SYSTEM
MunirVirani_2012S@235.49:237.58 SO WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH VULTURES
MunirVirani_2012S@238.04:244.24 WE HAVE EIGHT SPECIES OF VULTURES THAT OCCUR IN KENYA OF WHICH SIX ARE HIGHLY THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION
MunirVirani_2012S@244.74:259.26 THE REASON IS THAT THEY 'RE GETTING POISONED AND THE REASON THAT THEY 'RE GETTING POISONED IS BECAUSE THERE 'S HUMAN WILDLIFE CONFLICTS THE PASTORAL COMMUNITIES ARE USING THIS POISON TO TARGET PREDATORS AND IN RETURN THE VULTURES ARE FALLING VICTIM TO THIS
MunirVirani_2012S@259.59:277.58 IN SOUTH ASIA IN COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA AND PAKISTAN FOUR SPECIES OF VULTURES ARE LISTED AS CRITICALLY ENDANGERED WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE LESS THAN TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS TO GO EXTINCT AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE THEY ARE FALLING PREY BY CONSUMING LIVESTOCK THAT HAS BEEN TREATED WITH A PAINKILLING DRUG LIKE DICLOFENAC
MunirVirani_2012S@277.58:282.15 THIS DRUG HAS NOW BEEN BANNED FOR VETERINARY USE IN INDIA AND THEY HAVE TAKEN A STAND
MunirVirani_2012S@282.98:296.52 BECAUSE THERE ARE NO VULTURES THERE 'S BEEN A SPREAD IN THE NUMBERS OF FERAL DOGS AT CARCASS DUMP SITES AND WHEN YOU HAVE FERAL DOGS YOU HAVE A HUGE TIME BOMB OF RABIES THE NUMBER OF CASES OF RABIES HAS INCREASED TREMENDOUSLY IN INDIA
MunirVirani_2012S@296.84:313.88 KENYA IS GOING TO HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST WIND FARMS IN AFRICA THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE WIND TURBINES ARE GOING TO BE UP AT LAKE TURKANA I AM NOT AGAINST WIND ENERGY BUT WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE WIND TURBINES DO THIS TO BIRDS THEY SLICE THEM IN HALF THEY ARE BIRD BLENDING MACHINES
MunirVirani_2012S@314.82:317.36 IN WEST AFRICA THERE 'S A HORRIFIC TRADE
MunirVirani_2012S@317.79:321.68 OF DEAD VULTURES TO SERVE THE WITCHCRAFT AND THE FETISH MARKET
MunirVirani_2012S@322.73:332.67 SO WHAT 'S BEING DONE WELL WE 'RE CONDUCTING RESEARCH ON THESE BIRDS WE 'RE PUTTING TRANSMITTERS ON THEM WE 'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE THEIR BASIC ECOLOGY AND SEE WHERE THEY GO
MunirVirani_2012S@332.93:341.29 WE CAN SEE THAT THEY TRAVEL DIFFERENT COUNTRIES SO IF YOU FOCUS ON A PROBLEM LOCALLY IT 'S NOT GOING TO HELP YOU WE NEED TO WORK WITH GOVERNMENTS IN REGIONAL LEVELS
MunirVirani_2012S@341.85:344.15 WE 'RE WORKING WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES
MunirVirani_2012S@344.2:352.88 WE 'RE TALKING TO THEM ABOUT APPRECIATING VULTURES ABOUT THE NEED FROM WITHIN TO APPRECIATE THESE WONDERFUL CREATURES AND THE SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE
MunirVirani_2012S@353.13:357.41 HOW CAN YOU HELP YOU CAN BECOME ACTIVE MAKE NOISE
MunirVirani_2012S@357.8:362.82 YOU CAN WRITE A LETTER TO YOUR GOVERNMENT AND TELL THEM THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THESE VERY MISUNDERSTOOD CREATURES
MunirVirani_2012S@363.74:366.14 VOLUNTEER YOUR TIME TO SPREAD THE WORD
MunirVirani_2012S@366.39:374.32 SPREAD THE WORD WHEN YOU WALK OUT OF THIS ROOM YOU WILL BE INFORMED ABOUT VULTURES BUT SPEAK TO YOUR FAMILIES TO YOUR CHILDREN TO YOUR NEIGHBORS ABOUT VULTURES
MunirVirani_2012S@374.62:383.4 THEY ARE VERY GRACEFUL CHARLES DARWIN SAID HE CHANGED HIS MIND BECAUSE HE WATCHED THEM FLY EFFORTLESSLY WITHOUT ENERGY IN THE SKIES
MunirVirani_2012S@383.82:389.22 KENYA THIS WORLD WILL BE MUCH POORER WITHOUT THESE WONDERFUL SPECIES
