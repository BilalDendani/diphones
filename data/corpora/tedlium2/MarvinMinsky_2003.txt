MarvinMinsky_2003 IF YOU ASK PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT PART OF PSYCHOLOGY DO THEY THINK IS HARD AND YOU SAY WELL WHAT ABOUT THINKING AND EMOTIONS MOST PEOPLE WILL SAY
MarvinMinsky_2003 ARE TERRIBLY HARD THEY'RE INCREDIBLY COMPLEX THEY CAN'T I HAVE NO IDEA OF HOW THEY WORK BUT THINKING IS REALLY VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD IT'S JUST SORT OF SOME KIND OF LOGICAL REASONING OR SOMETHING
MarvinMinsky_2003 BUT THAT'S NOT THE HARD PART SO HERE 'S A LIST OF PROBLEMS THAT COME UP ONE NICE PROBLEM IS WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT HEALTH
MarvinMinsky_2003 THE OTHER DAY I WAS READING SOMETHING AND THE PERSON SAID PROBABLY THE LARGEST SINGLE CAUSE OF DISEASE IS HANDSHAKING IN THE WEST
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND THERE WAS A LITTLE STUDY ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DON'T HANDSHAKE AND COMPARING THEM WITH ONES WHO DO HANDSHAKE AND I HAVEN'T THE FOGGIEST IDEA OF WHERE YOU FIND THE ONES THAT DON'T HANDSHAKE BECAUSE THEY MUST BE HIDING
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND THE PEOPLE WHO AVOID THAT HAVE THIRTY PERCENT LESS INFECTIOUS DISEASE OR SOMETHING
MarvinMinsky_2003 IT WAS THIRTY ONE AND A QUARTER PERCENT SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF EPIDEMICS AND SO FORTH LET 'S START WITH THAT
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND SINCE I GOT THAT IDEA I'VE HAD TO SHAKE HUNDREDS OF HANDS AND
MarvinMinsky_2003 I THINK THE ONLY WAY TO AVOID IT IS TO HAVE SOME HORRIBLE VISIBLE DISEASE AND THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN EDUCATION HOW DO WE IMPROVE EDUCATION
MarvinMinsky_2003 THE SINGLE BEST WAY IS TO GET THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT THEY'RE BEING TOLD IS A WHOLE LOT OF NONSENSE AND THEN OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT HOW TO MODERATE THAT SO THAT ANYBODY CAN
MarvinMinsky_2003 OF LISTEN TO YOU POLLUTION ENERGY SHORTAGE ENVIRONMENTAL DIVERSITY POVERTY HOW DO WE MAKE STABLE SOCIETIES LONGEVITY
MarvinMinsky_2003 OKAY THERE 'RE LOTS OF PROBLEMS TO WORRY ABOUT ANYWAY THE QUESTION I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD TALK ABOUT AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY TABOO IS HOW MANY PEOPLE SHOULD THERE BE
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION OR MAYBE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND THEN NOTICE THAT A GREAT MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS DISAPPEAR IF YOU HAD ONE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE PROPERLY SPREAD OUT
MarvinMinsky_2003 THEN
MarvinMinsky_2003 IF THERE'S SOME GARBAGE YOU THROW IT AWAY PREFERABLY WHERE YOU CAN'T SEE IT AND IT WILL ROT OR YOU THROW IT INTO THE OCEAN AND SOME FISH WILL BENEFIT FROM IT
MarvinMinsky_2003 THE PROBLEM IS HOW MANY PEOPLE SHOULD THERE BE AND IT'S A SORT OF CHOICE WE HAVE TO MAKE MOST PEOPLE ARE ABOUT SIXTY INCHES HIGH OR MORE
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND THERE'S THIS CUBE LOSS SO IF YOU MAKE THEM THIS BIG
MarvinMinsky_2003 BY USING NANOTECHNOLOGY I SUPPOSE THEN YOU COULD HAVE
MarvinMinsky_2003 THOUSAND TIMES AS MANY THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT I DON'T SEE ANYBODY DOING ANY RESEARCH ON MAKING PEOPLE SMALLER NOW IT'S NICE TO REDUCE THE POPULATION BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN
MarvinMinsky_2003 LUCKY YOU'VE GOT TWENTY THREE FROM EACH PARENT
MarvinMinsky_2003 YOU GIVE THEM A SCANNER OR WHATEVER YOU NEED AND THEY LOOK AT THEIR CHROMOSOMES AND EACH OF THEM SAYS WHICH ONE HE LIKES BEST OR SHE
MarvinMinsky_2003 THAT BE ENOUGH AND THEN THE CHILDREN WOULD GET PLENTY OF SUPPORT AND NURTURING AND MENTORING AND THE WORLD POPULATION WOULD DECLINE VERY RAPIDLY AND EVERYBODY WOULD BE TOTALLY HAPPY
MarvinMinsky_2003 IS A LITTLE FURTHER OFF IN THE FUTURE AND THERE'S THIS GREAT NOVEL THAT ARTHUR CLARKE WROTE TWICE CALLED AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND THE CITY AND THE STARS THEY'RE BOTH WONDERFUL AND LARGELY THE SAME EXCEPT THAT COMPUTERS HAPPENED IN BETWEEN
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND ARTHUR WAS LOOKING AT THIS OLD BOOK AND HE SAID WELL THAT WAS WRONG THE FUTURE MUST HAVE SOME COMPUTERS SO IN THE SECOND VERSION OF IT
MarvinMinsky_2003 THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED BILLION OR ONE THOUSAND BILLION PEOPLE ON EARTH BUT THEY'RE ALL STORED ON HARD DISKS OR FLOPPIES OR WHATEVER THEY HAVE IN THE FUTURE
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND YOU LET A FEW MILLION OF THEM OUT AT A TIME A PERSON COMES OUT THEY LIVE FOR A THOUSAND YEARS DOING WHATEVER THEY DO AND THEN
MarvinMinsky_2003 WHEN IT'S TIME TO GO BACK FOR A BILLION YEARS OR A MILLION I FORGET THE NUMBERS DON'T MATTER BUT THERE REALLY AREN'T VERY MANY PEOPLE ON EARTH AT A TIME
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND YOU GET TO THINK ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOUR MEMORIES AND BEFORE YOU GO BACK INTO SUSPENSION YOU EDIT YOUR MEMORIES AND YOU CHANGE YOUR PERSONALITY AND SO FORTH THE PLOT OF THE BOOK IS THAT
MarvinMinsky_2003 HE SAYS MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE BEST WAY AND WRECKS THE WHOLE SYSTEM I DON'T THINK THE SOLUTIONS THAT I PROPOSED ARE GOOD ENOUGH OR SMART ENOUGH
MarvinMinsky_2003 I THINK THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT WE'RE NOT SMART ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND WHICH OF THE PROBLEMS WE'RE FACING ARE GOOD ENOUGH THEREFORE WE HAVE TO BUILD SUPER INTELLIGENT MACHINES LIKE HAL
MarvinMinsky_2003 AS YOU REMEMBER AT SOME POINT IN THE BOOK FOR TWO THOUSAND AND ONE HAL REALIZES THAT THE UNIVERSE IS TOO BIG AND GRAND AND PROFOUND
MarvinMinsky_2003 FOR THOSE REALLY STUPID ASTRONAUTS IF YOU CONTRAST HAL 'S BEHAVIOR WITH THE TRIVIALITY OF THE PEOPLE ON THE SPACESHIP
MarvinMinsky_2003 CAN SEE WHAT'S WRITTEN BETWEEN THE LINES WELL WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT WE COULD GET SMARTER I THINK THAT WE'RE PRETTY SMART AS COMPARED TO CHIMPANZEES
MarvinMinsky_2003 BUT WE'RE NOT SMART ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH THE COLOSSAL PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE EITHER IN ABSTRACT MATHEMATICS OR IN FIGURING OUT ECONOMIES OR BALANCING THE WORLD AROUND
MarvinMinsky_2003 SO ONE THING WE CAN DO IS LIVE LONGER AND NOBODY KNOWS HOW HARD THAT IS BUT WE'LL PROBABLY FIND OUT IN A FEW YEARS YOU SEE THERE'S TWO FORKS IN THE ROAD WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE LIVE TWICE AS LONG AS CHIMPANZEES ALMOST
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND NOBODY LIVES MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS FOR REASONS THAT AREN'T VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD BUT LOTS OF PEOPLE NOW LIVE TO NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED UNLESS THEY SHAKE HANDS TOO MUCH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND SO MAYBE IF WE LIVED TWO HUNDRED YEARS WE COULD ACCUMULATE ENOUGH SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE TO
MarvinMinsky_2003 SOLVE SOME PROBLEMS SO THAT'S ONE WAY OF GOING ABOUT IT AND AS I SAID WE DON'T KNOW HOW HARD THAT IS IT MIGHT BE AFTER ALL MOST OTHER MAMMALS
MarvinMinsky_2003 LIVE HALF AS LONG AS THE CHIMPANZEE SO WE'RE SORT OF THREE AND A HALF OR FOUR TIMES HAVE FOUR TIMES THE LONGEVITY OF MOST MAMMALS
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND IN THE CASE OF THE PRIMATES WE HAVE ALMOST THE SAME GENES WE ONLY DIFFER FROM CHIMPANZEES IN THE PRESENT STATE OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS ABSOLUTE HOGWASH
MarvinMinsky_2003 MAYBE BY JUST A FEW HUNDRED GENES WHAT I THINK IS THAT THE GENE COUNTERS DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING YET AND WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T READ ANYTHING ABOUT GENETICS THAT'S PUBLISHED WITHIN YOUR LIFETIME
MarvinMinsky_2003 THE STUFF HAS A VERY SHORT HALF LIFE SAME WITH BRAIN SCIENCE
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND
MarvinMinsky_2003 SO IT MIGHT BE THAT IF WE JUST FIX FOUR OR FIVE GENES WE CAN LIVE TWO HUNDRED YEARS OR IT MIGHT BE THAT IT'S JUST THIRTY OR FORTY
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND I DOUBT THAT IT'S SEVERAL HUNDRED SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WILL BE DISCUSSING AND LOTS OF ETHICISTS YOU KNOW AN ETHICIST IS SOMEBODY WHO SEES SOMETHING WRONG WITH WHATEVER YOU HAVE IN MIND
MarvinMinsky_2003 VERY HARD TO FIND AN ETHICIST WHO CONSIDERS ANY CHANGE WORTH MAKING BECAUSE HE SAYS WHAT ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES AND OF COURSE WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW ARE WE
MarvinMinsky_2003 LIKE ALL THIS COMPLAINT ABOUT CLONES AND YET TWO RANDOM PEOPLE WILL MATE AND HAVE THIS CHILD AND BOTH OF THEM HAVE SOME
MarvinMinsky_2003 PRETTY ROTTEN GENES AND THE CHILD IS LIKELY TO COME OUT TO BE AVERAGE WHICH BY CHIMPANZEE STANDARDS IS VERY GOOD INDEED
MarvinMinsky_2003 IF WE DO HAVE LONGEVITY THEN WE'LL HAVE TO FACE THE POPULATION GROWTH PROBLEM ANYWAY BECAUSE IF PEOPLE LIVE TWO HUNDRED OR ONE THOUSAND YEARS THEN WE CAN'T LET THEM HAVE A CHILD MORE THAN ABOUT ONCE EVERY TWO HUNDRED OR ONE THOUSAND YEARS
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND SO THERE WON 'T BE ANY WORKFORCE AND ONE OF THE THINGS LAURIE GARRETT POINTED OUT AND OTHERS HAVE IS THAT
MarvinMinsky_2003 A SOCIETY THAT DOESN'T HAVE PEOPLE OF WORKING AGE IS IN REAL TROUBLE AND THINGS ARE GOING TO GET WORSE BECAUSE THERE'S NOBODY TO EDUCATE THE CHILDREN OR TO
MarvinMinsky_2003 FEED THE OLD AND WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT A LONG LIFETIME OF COURSE I DON'T WANT SOMEBODY WHO 'S TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD TO BE LIKE OUR IMAGE OF WHAT A TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD IS WHICH IS DEAD ACTUALLY
MarvinMinsky_2003 YOU KNOW THERE'S ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BRAIN WHICH SEEM TO HAVE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS
MarvinMinsky_2003 KNOWS HOW MOST OF THEM WORK IN DETAIL BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE 'RE LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN THERE AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS WORK TOGETHER I LIKE FREUD 'S THEORY THAT MOST OF THEM ARE CANCELLING EACH OTHER OUT
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND SO IF YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS A SORT OF A CITY WITH A HUNDRED RESOURCES THEN WHEN YOU'RE AFRAID
MarvinMinsky_2003 FOR EXAMPLE YOU MAY DISCARD YOUR LONG RANGE GOALS BUT YOU MAY THINK DEEPLY AND FOCUS ON EXACTLY HOW TO ACHIEVE THAT PARTICULAR GOAL YOU THROW EVERYTHING ELSE AWAY YOU BECOME A MONOMANIAC
MarvinMinsky_2003 ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS NOT STEPPING OUT ON THAT PLATFORM AND WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY FOOD BECOMES MORE ATTRACTIVE AND SO FORTH SO I SEE EMOTIONS AS
MarvinMinsky_2003 HIGHLY EVOLVED SUB SETS OF YOUR CAPABILITY EMOTION IS NOT SOMETHING ADDED TO THOUGHT AN EMOTIONAL STATE IS WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU REMOVE
MarvinMinsky_2003 I HOPE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS TO SHOW THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO SMART MACHINES AND I GUESS I BETTER SKIP ALL THE REST OF THIS WHICH ARE SOME DETAILS ON HOW WE MIGHT MAKE THOSE SMART MACHINES
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND THE MAIN IDEA IS IN FACT THAT THE CORE OF A REALLY SMART MACHINE IS ONE THAT RECOGNIZES THAT A CERTAIN KIND OF PROBLEM IS FACING YOU THIS IS A PROBLEM OF SUCH AND SUCH A TYPE
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND THEREFORE THERE'S A CERTAIN WAY OR WAYS OF THINKING THAT ARE GOOD FOR THAT PROBLEM SO I THINK THE FUTURE MAIN PROBLEM OF PSYCHOLOGY IS TO CLASSIFY TYPES OF PREDICAMENTS TYPES OF SITUATIONS TYPES OF OBSTACLES
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND ALSO TO CLASSIFY AVAILABLE AND POSSIBLE WAYS TO THINK AND PAIR THEM UP SO YOU SEE IT'S ALMOST LIKE A PAVLOVIAN
MarvinMinsky_2003 WE LOST THE FIRST HUNDRED YEARS OF PSYCHOLOGY BY REALLY TRIVIAL THEORIES WHERE YOU SAY HOW DO PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO REACT TO A SITUATION
MarvinMinsky_2003 WHAT I'M SAYING IS AFTER WE GO THROUGH A LOT OF LEVELS INCLUDING DESIGNING A HUGE
MarvinMinsky_2003 MESSY SYSTEM WITH THOUSANDS OF PARTS WE'LL END UP AGAIN WITH THE CENTRAL PROBLEM OF PSYCHOLOGY SAYING NOT WHAT ARE THE SITUATIONS BUT WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF PROBLEMS
MarvinMinsky_2003 AND WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF STRATEGIES HOW DO YOU LEARN THEM HOW DO YOU CONNECT THEM UP HOW DOES A REALLY CREATIVE PERSON INVENT A NEW WAY OF THINKING
MarvinMinsky_2003 OUT OF THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND SO FORTH SO I THINK IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS IF WE CAN GET RID OF ALL OF THE TRADITIONAL
