JamieHeywood_2009P@33.33:42.51 YOU GO FROM BEING A HEALTHY ROBUST TWENTY NINE YEAR OLD MALE TO SOMEONE THAT CANNOT BREATHE CANNOT MOVE CANNOT SPEAK
JamieHeywood_2009P@46.37:48.83 THIS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN TO ME
JamieHeywood_2009P@51.47:56.38 BECAUSE WE BEGAN A JOURNEY TO LEARN A NEW WAY OF THINKING ABOUT LIFE
JamieHeywood_2009P@56.71:59.84 AND EVEN THOUGH STEVEN PASSED AWAY THREE YEARS AGO
JamieHeywood_2009P@60.74:64.96 WE HAD AN AMAZING JOURNEY AS A FAMILY WE DID NOT EVEN
JamieHeywood_2009P@70.80:72.20 AN INCREDIBLY POSITIVE WAY
JamieHeywood_2009P@73.03:79.92 I WANT TO TALK TODAY ABOUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DECIDED TO DO WHICH WAS TO THINK ABOUT A NEW WAY
JamieHeywood_2009P@80.18:89.44 OF APPROACHING HEALTHCARE BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW HERE TODAY IT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF A STORY THIS IS THE STORY OF MY BROTHER
JamieHeywood_2009P@90.50:94.49 IT'S JUST A STORY AND I WANT TO GO BEYOND THE STORY AND GO TO SOMETHING MORE
JamieHeywood_2009P@99.45:108.13 TO ACHIEVE AND HOW DO I GET THERE IS WHAT WE ARE HERE TO DO IN MEDICINE IS WHAT EVERYONE SHOULD DO AND THOSE QUESTIONS ALL HAVE VARIABLES TO THEM ALL OF OUR STATUSES ARE DIFFERENT
JamieHeywood_2009P@108.44:118.30 ALL OF OUR HOPES AND DREAMS WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH IS DIFFERENT AND OUR PATHS WILL BE DIFFERENT THEY ARE ALL STORIES BUT IT'S A STORY UNTIL WE CONVERT IT TO DATA AND SO WHAT WE DO
JamieHeywood_2009P@119.00:122.58 HAD WAS TO TAKE STEVEN 'S STATUS WHAT IS MY STATUS AND GO FROM
JamieHeywood_2009P@135.60:137.05 MAN ON HIS ICON
JamieHeywood_2009P@137.50:144.91 BUT THE REST OF THEM ARE REALLY WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE BECAUSE STEVEN DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WAS PARALYZED AS HE WAS IN THAT POOL HE COULD NOT WALK
JamieHeywood_2009P@159.96:169.76 A DATA POINT AT THAT ONE MOMENT IN TIME IT'S A DATA POINT OF STEVEN IN A CONTEXT HERE HE IS IN THE POOL BUT HERE HE IS HEALTHY AS A BUILDER TALLER STRONGER GOT ALL THE WOMEN AMAZING GUY
JamieHeywood_2009P@170.79:178.63 HERE HE IS WALKING DOWN THE ISLE BUT HE CAN BARELY WALK NOW SO IT'S IMPAIRED AND HE COULD STILL HOLD HIS WIFE 'S HAND BUT HE COULDN'T DO BUTTONS ON HIS CLOTHES CAN'T FEED
JamieHeywood_2009P@179.46:182.01 AND HERE HE IS PARALYZED COMPLETELY UNABLE TO BREATHE AND
JamieHeywood_2009P@182.75:188.41 OVER THIS TIME JOURNEY THESE STORIES OF HIS LIFE CONVERTED TO DATA HE RENOVATED MY CARRIAGE HOUSE
JamieHeywood_2009P@188.88:194.52 WHEN HE WAS COMPLETELY PARALYZED AND UNABLE TO SPEAK AND UNABLE TO BREATHE AND HE WON AN AWARD FOR A HISTORIC RESTORATION
JamieHeywood_2009P@196.71:202.75 SO HERE IS STEVEN ALONE SHARING THIS STORY IN THE WORLD AND THIS IS THE INSIGHT THE THING THAT WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT
JamieHeywood_2009P@203.29:213.81 BECAUSE WE HAVE GONE AWAY FROM THE COMMUNITY THAT WE ARE THE FACT THAT WE REALLY DO LOVE EACH OTHER AND WANT TO CARE FOR EACH OTHER WE NEED TO GIVE TO OTHERS TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO STEVEN IS SHARING THIS STORY
JamieHeywood_2009P@214.38:215.65 BUT HE IS NOT ALONE
JamieHeywood_2009P@216.27:224.79 THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE SHARING THEIR STORIES AND NOT STORIES IN WORDS BUT STORIES IN DATA AND WORDS AND WE CONVERT THAT INFORMATION INTO THIS STRUCTURE
JamieHeywood_2009P@225.07:232.31 THIS UNDERSTANDING THIS ABILITY TO CONVERT THOSE STORIES INTO SOMETHING THAT IS COMPUTABLE TO WHICH WE CAN BEGIN TO CHANGE THE WAY MEDICINE IS DONE
JamieHeywood_2009P@233.82:240.38 WE DID THIS FOR ALS WE CAN DO THIS FOR DEPRESSION PARKINSON 'S DISEASE HIV THESE ARE NOT SIMPLE THEY ARE NOT INTERNET SCALABLE THEY REQUIRE
JamieHeywood_2009P@275.64:277.00 THIS HIV PATIENT DOWN HERE
JamieHeywood_2009P@278.32:280.67 TWO YEARS OF THIS DISEASE ALL OF THE SYMPTOMS ARE
JamieHeywood_2009P@280.87:289.80 THERE BUT HE IS WORKING TO KEEP HIS CD FOUR COUNT HIGH AND HIS VIRAL LEVEL LOW SO HE CAN MAKE HIS LIFE BETTER BUT YOU CAN AGGREGATE THIS AND YOU CAN DISCOVER THINGS ABOUT TREATMENTS
JamieHeywood_2009P@290.53:295.67 TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE ALMOST ON COPAXONE THESE ARE PATIENTS CURRENTLY ON DRUGS SHARING
JamieHeywood_2009P@300.11:308.53 ANYONE WANT TO RUN A COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS STUDY ON PRAYER AGAINST SOMETHING LET 'S LOOK AT PRAYER WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS JUST SORT OF INTERESTING DESIGN PROBLEMS THESE ARE WHY PEOPLE PRAY
JamieHeywood_2009P@322.30:329.95 OR I WANT TO LOOK AT ANXIETY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE PRAYING FOR ANXIETY AND HERE IS DATA ON FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE 'S CURRENT ANXIETY RIGHT NOW
JamieHeywood_2009P@379.40:393.18 FLASH AND YOU CAN SEE HERE AS THIS ANIMATES OVER STEVEN 'S ACTUAL DATA AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF ALL OTHER PATIENTS AGAINST THIS INFORMATION THE BLUE BAND IS THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE STEVEN IS THE SEVENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE THAT HE HAS NON GENETIC
JamieHeywood_2009P@393.93:401.19 YOU SCROLL DOWN IN THIS PROFILE AND YOU CAN SEE ALL OF HIS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BUT MORE THAN THAT IN THE NEW VERSION I CAN LOOK AT THIS INTERACTIVELY WAIT
JamieHeywood_2009P@402.98:408.54 A GREAT STOCK PROGRAM WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF THE TECHNOLOGY WE USED TO TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES WAS AS GOOD AS THE TECHNOLOGY WE USE TO MAKE MONEY
JamieHeywood_2009P@411.10:417.37 DRUG INTEGRATED INTO THAT THE STEM CELL TRANSPLANT THAT HE HAD THE FIRST IN THE WORLD SHARED OPENLY FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO SEE IT
JamieHeywood_2009P@419.26:429.32 I LOVE HERE THE CYBERKINETICS IMPLANT WHICH WAS AGAIN THE ONLY PATIENTS DATA THAT WAS ONLINE AND AVAILABLE YOU CAN ADJUST THE TIME SCALE YOU CAN ADJUST THE SYMPTOMS YOU CAN LOOK AT THE INTERACTION
JamieHeywood_2009P@445.91:454.12 BUT I WANT MORE I DON'T WANT TO JUST LOOK AT THIS COOL DEVICE I WANT TO TAKE THIS DATA AND MAKE SOMETHING EVEN BETTER I WANT MY BROTHER 'S CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE AND HIS SYMPTOMS
JamieHeywood_2009P@455.39:455.88 DRUGS
JamieHeywood_2009P@457.77:467.67 AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT INTERACT AMONG THOSE THE SIDE EFFECTS TO BE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL DATA GALAXY THAT WE CAN LOOK AT IN ANY WAY WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND IT SO THAT WE CAN TAKE THIS INFORMATION
JamieHeywood_2009P@468.19:469.21 AND GO BEYOND
JamieHeywood_2009P@470.56:472.60 JUST THIS SIMPLE MODEL OF
JamieHeywood_2009P@474.33:480.17 RECORD IS I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A MEDICAL RECORD IS I WANT TO SOLVE A PROBLEM I WANT AN APPLICATION SO
JamieHeywood_2009P@489.64:497.51 YEARS AFTER HE 'S HAD THESE DRUGS I LEARNED THAT EVERYTHING HE DID TO MANAGE HIS EXCESS SALIVA INCLUDING SOME POSITIVE SIDE EFFECTS THAT CAME FROM OTHER DRUGS
JamieHeywood_2009P@498.07:504.49 MAKING HIS CONSTIPATION WORSE AND IF ANYONE 'S EVER HAD SEVERE CONSTIPATION AND YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT THAT HAS ON YOUR LIFE YES THAT WAS
JamieHeywood_2009P@516.24:527.91 SO PATIENTS HAVE THIS WE'RE FOR PATIENTS THIS IS ALL ABOUT PATIENT HEALTH CARE THERE WAS NO DOCTORS ON OUR NETWORK THIS IS ABOUT THE PATIENTS SO HOW CAN WE TAKE THIS AND BRING THEM A TOOL THAT THEY CAN GO BACK AND THEY CAN ENGAGE THE MEDICAL SYSTEM
JamieHeywood_2009P@570.84:580.33 THAT IS A DRUG USED TO TREAT BIPOLAR DISORDER THAT A GROUP IN ITALY FOUND SLOWED ALS DOWN IN SIXTEEN PATIENTS AND PUBLISHED IT NOW WE'LL SKIP THE CRITIQUES OF THE PAPER
JamieHeywood_2009P@580.71:590.18 BUT THE SHORT STORY IS IF YOU'RE A PATIENT YOU WANT TO BE ON THE BLUE LINE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE RED LINE YOU WANT TO BE ON THE BLUE LINE BECAUSE THE BLUE LINE IS A BETTER LINE THE RED LINE IS WAY DOWNHILL THE BLUE LINE IS A GOOD LINE
JamieHeywood_2009P@590.67:602.41 SO YOU KNOW WE SAID WE LOOKED AT THIS AND WHAT I LOVE ALSO IS THAT PEOPLE ALWAYS ACCUSE THESE INTERNET SITES OF PROMOTING BAD MEDICINE AND HAVING PEOPLE DO THINGS IRRESPONSIBLY SO THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN PNAS PUBLISHED THIS
JamieHeywood_2009P@602.91:612.03 TEN PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR SYSTEM TOOK LITHIUM TEN PERCENT OF THE PATIENTS STARTED TAKING LITHIUM BASED ON SIXTEEN PATIENTS OF DATA IN A BAD PUBLICATION AND THEY CALL THE INTERNET IRRESPONSIBLE
JamieHeywood_2009P@612.73:619.56 AND HERE IS THE IMPLICATION OF WHAT HAPPENS AND THERE IS THIS ONE GUY NAMED HUMBERTO FROM BRAZIL WHO UNFORTUNATELY PASSED AWAY NINE MONTHS AGO
JamieHeywood_2009P@620.51:633.94 WHO SAID HEY LISTEN CAN YOU HELP US ANSWER THIS QUESTION BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT TRIAL IT'S GOING TO BE YEARS I WANT TO KNOW NOW CAN YOU HELP US SO WE LAUNCHED SOME TOOLS WE LET THEM TRACK THEIR BLOOD LEVELS WE LET THEM SHARE THE DATA AND EXCHANGE IT YOU KNOW A DATA NETWORK
JamieHeywood_2009P@672.31:676.52 A TIME MACHINE FOR PATIENTS EXCEPT INSTEAD OF GOING BACKWARDS WE GO
JamieHeywood_2009P@677.85:682.35 CAN WE FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU SO THAT YOU CAN MAYBE CHANGE
JamieHeywood_2009P@684.09:695.37 SO WE DID WE TOOK ALL THE PATIENTS LIKE HUMBERTO THAT'S THE APPLE BACKGROUND WE STOLE THAT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO BUILD OUR OWN THIS IS A REAL APP BY THE WAY THIS IS NOT JUST GRAPHICS AND YOU TAKE THOSE DATA AND WE FIND THE PATIENTS LIKE HIM AND WE BRING THEIR DATA TOGETHER
JamieHeywood_2009P@695.90:698.10 AND WE BRING THEIR HISTORIES INTO IT
JamieHeywood_2009P@699.13:702.96 HOW DO WE LINE THEM ALL UP SO WE LINE THEM ALL UP SO THEY GO TOGETHER
JamieHeywood_2009P@703.51:713.33 AROUND THE MEANINGFUL POINTS INTEGRATED ACROSS EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT THE PATIENT FULL INFORMATION THE ENTIRE COURSE OF THEIR DISEASE AND THAT'S WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO HUMBERTO UNLESS HE DOES SOMETHING
JamieHeywood_2009P@720.33:724.33 NOW THE ONES THAT IT DOESN'T WORK ARE INTERESTING BUT ALMOST ALL THE TIME IT WORKS
JamieHeywood_2009P@742.98:743.84 TO TAKE
JamieHeywood_2009P@745.13:749.80 THESE ARE ALL THE PATIENTS THAT STARTED LITHIUM IT'S THE INTENT TO TREAT CURVE AND YOU CAN SEE HERE
JamieHeywood_2009P@783.16:790.25 YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DROPPED OUT THE TRIAL THERE IS TOO MUCH DROP OUT CAN WE DO THE EVEN HARDER THING CAN WE GO TO THE PATIENTS THAT ACTUALLY
JamieHeywood_2009P@792.05:800.85 LITHIUM BECAUSE THEY WERE SO CONVINCED THEY WERE GETTING BETTER AND WE ASKED OUR CONTROL ALGORITHM ARE THOSE SIXTY NINE PATIENTS BY THE WAY YOU'LL NOTICE THAT'S FOUR TIMES THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS IN THE CLINICAL TRIAL
JamieHeywood_2009P@803.20:809.72 CAN WE LOOK AT THOSE PATIENTS AND SAY CAN WE MATCH THEM WITH OUR TIME MACHINE TO THE OTHER PATIENTS THAT ARE JUST LIKE THEM
JamieHeywood_2009P@810.55:817.27 WHAT HAPPENS AND EVEN THE ONES THAT BELIEVED THEY WERE GETTING BETTER MATCHED THE CONTROLS EXACTLY EXACTLY
JamieHeywood_2009P@817.47:827.74 AND THOSE LITTLE LINES THAT'S THE POWER SO WE I CAN'T TELL YOU LITHIUM DOESN'T WORK I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT IF YOU DID IT AT A HIGHER DOSE OF IF YOU RUN THE STUDY PROPER I CAN TELL YOU THAT FOR THOSE SIXTY NINE PEOPLE THAT TOOK
JamieHeywood_2009P@829.11:831.46 THEY DIDN'T DO ANY BETTER THAN THE PEOPLE THAT WERE JUST LIKE THEM
JamieHeywood_2009P@851.75:853.37 MY BROTHER 'S STEM CELL TRANSPLANT
JamieHeywood_2009P@857.26:864.93 I PUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION CELLS IN HIS CISTERNA MAGNA IN HIS LUMBAR CORD AND FILLED OUT THE IRBS AND DID ALL THIS WORK AND I NEVER REALLY
JamieHeywood_2009P@866.73:867.64 AND HOW DID I
JamieHeywood_2009P@902.66:903.87 THIS TWO DAYS AGO
JamieHeywood_2009P@905.96:912.60 IT WAS THAT LITTLE OUTLIERS THERE YOU SEE THAT GUY THAT LIVED A LONG TIME WE HAVE TO GO TALK TO HIM BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE SOMETHING WENT DIFFERENT BUT
JamieHeywood_2009P@914.15:915.56 MY BROTHER WENT STRAIGHT DOWN THE LINE
JamieHeywood_2009P@915.91:917.45 IT ONLY WORKS ABOUT TWELVE MONTHS
JamieHeywood_2009P@918.10:920.77 IT'S THE FIRST VERSION OF THE TIME MACHINE FIRST TIME WE EVER TRIED IT
JamieHeywood_2009P@927.48:935.51 I LOOK AT THIS AND I GET REALLY EMOTIONAL YOU LOOK AT THE PATIENTS YOU CAN DRILL IN ALL THE CONTROLS YOU CAN LOOK AT THEM YOU CAN ASK THEM AND I FOUND A WOMAN THAT
JamieHeywood_2009P@937.86:945.66 WE FOUND HER SHE WAS ODD BECAUSE SHE HAD DATA AFTER SHE DIED AND HER HUSBAND HAD COME IN AND ENTERED HER LAST FUNCTIONAL SCORES BECAUSE HE KNEW HOW MUCH
JamieHeywood_2009P@948.16:952.36 AND I AM THANKFUL I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THESE PEOPLE
JamieHeywood_2009P@953.01:959.94 YEARS AFTER MY BROTHER HAD DIED HELPED ME ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER AN OPERATION I DID AND SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON YEARS AGO WORKED OR NOT
JamieHeywood_2009P@963.35:964.58 WHEN I'D DONE IT THE FIRST TIME
JamieHeywood_2009P@965.68:968.34 AND I'M REALLY EXCITED THAT IT'S HERE NOW BECAUSE
JamieHeywood_2009P@970.05:974.08 THE LAB THAT I FOUNDED HAS SOME DATA ON A DRUG THAT MIGHT WORK
JamieHeywood_2009P@976.79:979.87 AND I'D LIKE TO SHOW IT I'D LIKE TO SHOW IT IN REAL TIME NOW
JamieHeywood_2009P@981.28:983.73 THAT FOR ALL OF THE DISEASES THAT WE CAN DO THAT FOR
JamieHeywood_2009P@987.30:991.18 THE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THIS SOCIAL EXPERIMENT WITH US
JamieHeywood_2009P@993.20:995.57 AN AMAZING JOURNEY WE ARE GOING ON TO BECOME
JamieHeywood_2009P@996.18:999.93 HUMAN AGAIN TO BE PART OF COMMUNITY AGAIN TO SHARE
