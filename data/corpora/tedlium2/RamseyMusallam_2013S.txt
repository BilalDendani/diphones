RamseyMusallam_2013S TEACH CHEMISTRY
RamseyMusallam_2013S OVER AND OVER SOME PEOPLE NODDING YES
RamseyMusallam_2013S RECENTLY I SHOWED THIS TO MY STUDENTS AND I JUST ASKED THEM TO TRY AND EXPLAIN WHY IT HAPPENED THE QUESTIONS AND CONVERSATIONS THAT FOLLOWED WERE FASCINATING CHECK OUT THIS VIDEO THAT MADDIE FROM MY PERIOD THREE CLASS SENT ME THAT EVENING
RamseyMusallam_2013S OBVIOUSLY AS MADDIE 'S CHEMISTRY TEACHER I LOVE THAT SHE WENT HOME AND CONTINUED TO GEEK OUT ABOUT THIS KIND OF RIDICULOUS DEMONSTRATION THAT WE DID IN CLASS
RamseyMusallam_2013S BUT WHAT FASCINATED ME MORE IS THAT MADDIE 'S CURIOSITY TOOK HER TO A NEW LEVEL
RamseyMusallam_2013S IF YOU LOOK INSIDE THAT BEAKER YOU MIGHT SEE A CANDLE MADDIE 'S USING TEMPERATURE TO EXTEND THIS PHENOMENON TO A NEW SCENARIO YOU KNOW QUESTIONS AND CURIOSITY LIKE MADDIE 'S ARE MAGNETS THAT DRAW US TOWARDS OUR TEACHERS AND THEY TRANSCEND
RamseyMusallam_2013S ALL TECHNOLOGY OR BUZZWORDS IN EDUCATION BUT IF WE PLACE THESE TECHNOLOGIES BEFORE STUDENT INQUIRY WE CAN BE ROBBING OURSELVES OF OUR GREATEST TOOL AS TEACHERS
RamseyMusallam_2013S OUR STUDENTS QUESTIONS
RamseyMusallam_2013S FOR EXAMPLE FLIPPING A BORING LECTURE FROM THE CLASSROOM TO THE SCREEN OF A MOBILE DEVICE MIGHT SAVE INSTRUCTIONAL TIME BUT IF IT IS THE FOCUS OF OUR STUDENTS EXPERIENCE IT 'S THE SAME DEHUMANIZING CHATTER JUST WRAPPED UP IN FANCY CLOTHING BUT IF INSTEAD WE HAVE THE GUTS
RamseyMusallam_2013S TO CONFUSE OUR STUDENTS PERPLEX THEM AND EVOKE REAL QUESTIONS
RamseyMusallam_2013S THROUGH THOSE QUESTIONS WE AS TEACHERS HAVE INFORMATION THAT WE CAN USE TO TAILOR ROBUST
RamseyMusallam_2013S AND INFORMED METHODS OF BLENDED INSTRUCTION
RamseyMusallam_2013S SO TWENTY FIRST CENTURY LINGO JARGON MUMBO JUMBO ASIDE
RamseyMusallam_2013S THE TRUTH IS I 'VE BEEN TEACHING FOR THIRTEEN YEARS NOW
RamseyMusallam_2013S AND IT TOOK A LIFE THREATENING SITUATION
RamseyMusallam_2013S NOT SOME SCRIPTED CURRICULUM THAT GAVE THEM TIDBITS OF RANDOM INFORMATION
RamseyMusallam_2013S IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AT THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD
RamseyMusallam_2013S WITH A TWO YEAR OLD AT HOME AND MY SECOND CHILD ON THE WAY I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A LARGE ANEURYSM AT THE BASE OF MY THORACIC AORTA THIS LED TO OPEN HEART SURGERY THIS IS THE ACTUAL REAL EMAIL FROM MY DOCTOR RIGHT
RamseyMusallam_2013S THERE NOW WHEN I GOT THIS I WAS PRESS CAPS LOCK
RamseyMusallam_2013S ABSOLUTELY FREAKED OUT OKAY BUT
RamseyMusallam_2013S AND THIRD THROUGH INTENSE REFLECTION HE GATHERED THE INFORMATION THAT HE NEEDED
RamseyMusallam_2013S TO DESIGN AND REVISE THE PROCEDURE AND THEN WITH A STEADY HAND
RamseyMusallam_2013S THAT I BRING TO MY LESSON PLANNING STILL TODAY
RamseyMusallam_2013S RULE NUMBER ONE CURIOSITY COMES FIRST
RamseyMusallam_2013S QUESTIONS CAN BE WINDOWS TO GREAT INSTRUCTION BUT NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND
RamseyMusallam_2013S WE 'RE ALL TEACHERS WE KNOW LEARNING IS UGLY
RamseyMusallam_2013S AND JUST BECAUSE THE SCIENTIFIC
RamseyMusallam_2013S METHOD IS ALLOCATED TO PAGE FIVE OF SECTION ONE POINT TWO OF CHAPTER ONE OF THE ONE THAT WE ALL SKIP
RamseyMusallam_2013S AND RULE NUMBER THREE
RamseyMusallam_2013S BUT IT ALSO DESERVES OUR REVISION
RamseyMusallam_2013S CAN WE BE THE SURGEONS OF OUR CLASSROOMS
RamseyMusallam_2013S AS IF WHAT WE ARE DOING ONE DAY WILL SAVE LIVES OUR STUDENTS OUR WORTH IT
RamseyMusallam_2013S AND EACH CASE IS DIFFERENT
RamseyMusallam_2013S SOUTHERN FAMILY AND ON THE LEFT RILEY NOW RILEY 'S GOING TO BE A BIG GIRL IN A COUPLE WEEKS HERE SHE 'S GOING TO BE FOUR YEARS OLD
RamseyMusallam_2013S AND ANYONE WHO KNOWS A FOUR YEAR OLD KNOWS THAT THEY LOVE TO ASK
RamseyMusallam_2013S WHY YEAH WHY
RamseyMusallam_2013S I COULD TEACH THIS KID ANYTHING BECAUSE SHE IS CURIOUS ABOUT EVERYTHING WE ALL WERE AT THAT AGE
RamseyMusallam_2013S BUT THE CHALLENGE IS REALLY FOR RILEY 'S FUTURE TEACHERS THE ONES SHE HAS YET TO MEET
RamseyMusallam_2013S HOW WILL THEY GROW THIS CURIOSITY
RamseyMusallam_2013S YOU SEE I WOULD ARGUE THAT RILEY IS A METAPHOR FOR ALL KIDS
RamseyMusallam_2013S TO THE SENIOR WHO 'S CHECKED OUT BEFORE THE YEAR 'S EVEN BEGUN OR THAT EMPTY DESK
RamseyMusallam_2013S IN THE BACK OF AN URBAN MIDDLE SCHOOL 'S CLASSROOM
RamseyMusallam_2013S BUT IF WE AS EDUCATORS LEAVE BEHIND THIS SIMPLE ROLE AS DISSEMINATORS OF CONTENT AND EMBRACE A NEW PARADIGM
RamseyMusallam_2013S AS CULTIVATORS OF CURIOSITY AND INQUIRY
RamseyMusallam_2013S WE JUST MIGHT BRING A LITTLE BIT MORE MEANING TO THEIR SCHOOL DAY AND SPARK THEIR IMAGINATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH
