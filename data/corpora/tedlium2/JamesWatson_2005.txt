JamesWatson_2005@18.23:27.64 CHRIS ASKED ME TO TELL AGAIN HOW WE FOUND THE STRUCTURE OF DNA AND SINCE YOU KNOW I FOLLOW HIS ORDERS I'LL DO IT BUT IT SLIGHTLY BORES ME AND
JamesWatson_2005@31.28:33.00 BOOK SO I'LL SAY SOMETHING
JamesWatson_2005@35.78:45.37 SAY A LITTLE ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW THE DISCOVERY WAS MADE AND WHY FRANCIS AND I FOUND IT AND THEN I HOPE MAYBE I HAVE AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES TO SAY WHAT
JamesWatson_2005@46.38:56.82 MAKES ME TICK NOW IN BACK OF ME IS A PICTURE OF ME WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN I WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO IN MY THIRD YEAR
JamesWatson_2005@57.51:65.78 AND I WAS IN MY THIRD YEAR BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO LET YOU IN AFTER TWO YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL SO YOU
JamesWatson_2005@68.23:79.35 GET AWAY FROM HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE I WAS VERY SMALL AND I WAS NO GOOD IN SPORTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT I SHOULD SAY THAT MY BACKGROUND MY FATHER
JamesWatson_2005@80.28:87.32 RAISED TO BE AN EPISCOPALIAN AND REPUBLICAN BUT AFTER ONE YEAR OF COLLEGE HE BECAME AN ATHEIST AND A DEMOCRAT
JamesWatson_2005@88.20:88.53 AND
JamesWatson_2005@90.46:102.09 MY MOTHER WAS IRISH CATHOLIC AND BUT SHE DIDN'T TAKE RELIGION TOO SERIOUSLY AND BY THE AGE OF ELEVEN I WAS NO LONGER GOING TO SUNDAY MASS AND
JamesWatson_2005@102.50:109.36 GOING ON BIRDWATCHING WALKS WITH MY FATHER SO EARLY ON I HEARD OF CHARLES DARWIN
JamesWatson_2005@110.56:118.63 I GUESS YOU KNOW HE WAS THE BIG HERO AND YOU KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND LIFE AS IT NOW EXISTS THROUGH EVOLUTION
JamesWatson_2005@119.24:128.62 AND AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO I WAS A ZOOLOGY MAJOR AND THOUGHT I WOULD END UP YOU KNOW IF I WAS BRIGHT ENOUGH MAYBE GETTING A PHD FROM CORNELL
JamesWatson_2005@132.04:132.47 THEN
JamesWatson_2005@135.18:148.77 PAPER THERE WAS A REVIEW OF A BOOK CALLED WHAT IS LIFE BY THE GREAT PHYSICIST SCHRODINGER AND THAT OF COURSE HAD BEEN A QUESTION I WANTED TO KNOW YOU KNOW DARWIN EXPLAINED LIFE AFTER IT GOT STARTED BUT WHAT WAS THE ESSENCE OF LIFE
JamesWatson_2005@149.46:156.80 AND SCHRODINGER SAID THE ESSENCE WAS INFORMATION PRESENT IN OUR CHROMOSOMES AND IT HAD TO BE PRESENT
JamesWatson_2005@159.01:165.99 ON A MOLECULE I'D NEVER REALLY THOUGHT OF MOLECULES BEFORE YOU KNOW CHROMOSOMES BUT THIS WAS A MOLECULE AND
JamesWatson_2005@166.99:175.05 SOMEHOW ALL THE INFORMATION WAS PROBABLY PRESENT IN SOME DIGITAL FORM AND THERE WAS THE BIG QUESTION OF HOW DID YOU COPY THE INFORMATION
JamesWatson_2005@176.31:182.05 SO THAT WAS THE BOOK AND SO FROM THAT MOMENT ON I WANTED TO
JamesWatson_2005@184.01:194.81 BE A GENETICIST UNDERSTAND THE GENE AND THROUGH THAT UNDERSTAND LIFE SO I HAD YOU KNOW A HERO AT A DISTANCE IT WASN'T A BASEBALL PLAYER IT WAS LINUS PAULING
JamesWatson_2005@195.46:200.52 AND SO I APPLIED TO CALTECH AND THEY TURNED ME DOWN
JamesWatson_2005@202.70:203.03 SO I
JamesWatson_2005@203.21:211.26 TO INDIANA WHICH WAS ACTUALLY AS GOOD AS CALTECH IN GENETICS AND BESIDES THEY HAD A REALLY GOOD BASKETBALL TEAM SO I HAD
JamesWatson_2005@211.58:221.10 REALLY QUITE HAPPY LIFE AT INDIANA AND IT WAS AT INDIANA I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU KNOW THE GENE WAS LIKELY TO BE DNA AND SO WHEN I GOT MY PHD I SHOULD GO
JamesWatson_2005@222.86:232.62 SO I FIRST WENT TO COPENHAGEN BECAUSE I THOUGHT WELL MAYBE I COULD BECOME A BIOCHEMIST BUT I DISCOVERED BIOCHEMISTRY WAS VERY BORING
JamesWatson_2005@233.40:246.95 IT WASN'T GOING ANYWHERE TOWARD YOU KNOW SAYING WHAT THE GENE WAS IT WAS JUST NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND OH THAT'S THE BOOK LITTLE BOOK YOU CAN READ IT IN ABOUT TWO HOURS AND BUT THEN I WENT TO A MEETING IN ITALY AND
JamesWatson_2005@248.10:260.70 THERE WAS AN UNEXPECTED SPEAKER WHO WASN'T ON THE PROGRAM AND HE TALKED ABOUT DNA AND THIS WAS MAURICE WILKINS HE WAS TRAINED AS A PHYSICIST AND AFTER THE WAR HE WANTED TO DO BIOPHYSICS AND HE PICKED DNA BECAUSE
JamesWatson_2005@261.23:267.07 DNA HAD BEEN DETERMINED AT THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE TO POSSIBLY BE THE GENETIC MOLECULES ON THE CHROMOSOMES
JamesWatson_2005@271.57:275.40 DNA WAS THE BEST BET AND HE SHOWED THIS X RAY PHOTOGRAPH
JamesWatson_2005@287.83:295.67 SO I WANTED TO WORK WITH HIM BUT HE DIDN'T WANT A FORMER BIRDWATCHER AND I ENDED UP IN CAMBRIDGE ENGLAND SO I WENT TO CAMBRIDGE BECAUSE
JamesWatson_2005@305.10:315.42 IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS THE DOMAIN OF THE PHYSICISTS SO THE BEST PLACE FOR X RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY WAS AT THE CAVENDISH LABORATORY AT CAMBRIDGE AND
JamesWatson_2005@316.55:323.17 THERE I MET FRANCIS CRICK I WENT THERE WITHOUT KNOWING HIM HE WAS THIRTY FIVE I WAS TWENTY THREE
JamesWatson_2005@325.17:332.91 WITHIN A DAY WE HAD DECIDED THAT MAYBE WE COULD TAKE A SHORTCUT TO FINDING THE STRUCTURE
JamesWatson_2005@333.67:342.96 SOLVE IT LIKE YOU KNOW IN RIGOROUS FASHION BUT BUILD A MODEL AN ELECTRO MODEL USING SOME COORDINATES OF
JamesWatson_2005@343.18:350.37 YOU KNOW LENGTH ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF FROM X RAY PHOTOGRAPHS BUT JUST ASK WHAT THE MOLECULE HOW SHOULD IT FOLD UP
JamesWatson_2005@350.98:363.18 AND THE REASON FOR DOING SO AT THE CENTER OF THIS PHOTOGRAPH IS LINUS PAULING ABOUT SIX MONTHS BEFORE HE PROPOSED THE ALPHA HELICAL STRUCTURE FOR PROTEINS AND IN DOING SO HE BANISHED THE MAN OUT ON THE RIGHT
JamesWatson_2005@363.96:372.03 WHO WAS THE CAVENDISH PROFESSOR THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPH SEVERAL YEARS LATER WHEN BRAGG HAD CAUSE TO SMILE HE CERTAINLY WASN'T SMILING WHEN I GOT THERE BECAUSE HE
JamesWatson_2005@394.22:401.07 WAS COMPARABLE WITH THE HELIX SO WE BUILT A THREE STRANDED MODEL THE PEOPLE FROM LONDON CAME UP WILKINS AND THIS
JamesWatson_2005@415.74:427.95 AND SO WE DIDN'T BUILD ANY MODELS AND FRANCIS SORT OF CONTINUED TO WORK ON PROTEINS AND BASICALLY I DID NOTHING AND
JamesWatson_2005@428.77:440.63 YOU KNOW BASICALLY READING IS A GOOD THING YOU GET FACTS AND WE KEPT TELLING THE PEOPLE IN LONDON THAT LINUS PAULING 'S GOING TO MOVE ON TO DNA IF DNA IS THAT IMPORTANT LINUS WILL KNOW IT HE'LL BUILD A MODEL AND THEN
JamesWatson_2005@442.24:451.66 IN FACT HE'D WRITTEN THE PEOPLE IN LONDON COULD HE SEE THEIR X RAY PHOTOGRAPH AND THEY HAD THE WISDOM TO SAY NO SO HE DIDN'T HAVE IT BUT THERE WAS ONES IN THE LITERATURE
JamesWatson_2005@458.01:466.28 FIFTEEN MONTHS AFTER I GOT TO CAMBRIDGE A RUMOR BEGAN TO APPEAR FROM LINUS PAULING 'S SON WHO WAS IN CAMBRIDGE SAID HIS FATHER WAS NOW WORKING ON DNA
JamesWatson_2005@474.35:481.36 I WAS SCARED BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WE MAY BE SCOOPED I HAVE NOTHING TO DO NO QUALIFICATIONS FOR ANYTHING
JamesWatson_2005@483.17:484.37 AND SO THERE
JamesWatson_2005@484.55:491.24 WAS THE PAPER AND HE PROPOSED A THREE STRANDED STRUCTURE AND I READ IT AND IT WAS JUST IT WAS
JamesWatson_2005@496.48:507.08 WAS YOU KNOW UNEXPECTED FROM THE WORLD 'S AND SO IT WAS HELD TOGETHER BY HYDROGEN BONDS BETWEEN PHOSPHATE GROUPS WELL
JamesWatson_2005@508.05:519.13 THE PEAK PH THAT CELLS HAVE IS AROUND SEVEN THOSE HYDROGEN BONDS COULDN'T EXIST WE RUSHED OVER TO THE CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT AND SAID COULD PAULING BE RIGHT AND ALEX HUST SAID NO SO
JamesWatson_2005@520.24:528.04 WE WERE HAPPY AND YOU KNOW WE WERE STILL IN THE GAME BUT WE WERE FRIGHTENED THAT SOMEBODY AT CALTECH
JamesWatson_2005@528.48:536.59 TELL LINUS THAT HE WAS WRONG AND SO BRAGG SAID BUILD MODELS AND A MONTH AFTER WE GOT THE PAULING MANUSCRIPT
JamesWatson_2005@544.27:552.98 THAT THEY SHOULD IMMEDIATELY START BUILDING MODELS BUT WILKINS SAID NO ROSALIND FRANKLIN WAS LEAVING IN ABOUT TWO MONTHS AND AFTER SHE LEFT
JamesWatson_2005@564.82:572.75 SHE REALLY YOU KNOW IN ONE SENSE SHE WAS A CHEMIST BUT REALLY SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAINED SHE DIDN'T KNOW ANY ORGANIC CHEMISTRY OR
JamesWatson_2005@603.32:611.95 WE WEREN'T THE BEST CHEMISTS IN THE ROOM I WENT IN AND SHOWED THEM A PAIRING I'D DONE AND JERRY DONOHUE HE WAS A CHEMIST HE
JamesWatson_2005@612.62:619.93 WRONG YOU'VE GOT THE HYDROGEN ATOMS ARE IN THE WRONG PLACE I JUST PUT THEM DOWN LIKE THEY WERE IN THE BOOKS HE SAID THEY WERE WRONG
JamesWatson_2005@620.49:633.07 SO THE NEXT DAY YOU KNOW AFTER I THOUGHT WELL HE MIGHT BE RIGHT SO I CHANGED THE LOCATIONS AND THEN WE FOUND THE BASE PAIRING AND FRANCIS IMMEDIATELY SAID THE CHAINS RUN IN ABSOLUTE DIRECTIONS AND WE KNEW WE WERE RIGHT
JamesWatson_2005@633.98:639.86 SO IT WAS A PRETTY YOU KNOW IT ALL HAPPENED IN ABOUT TWO HOURS
JamesWatson_2005@641.40:650.42 FROM NOTHING TO THING AND WE KNEW IT WAS BIG BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF YOU JUST PUT A NEXT TO T AND G NEXT TO C YOU HAVE A
JamesWatson_2005@652.47:661.04 SO WE SAW HOW GENETIC INFORMATION IS CARRIED IT'S THE ORDER OF THE FOUR BASES SO IN A SENSE IT IS A SORT OF DIGITAL TYPE INFORMATION
JamesWatson_2005@661.40:669.52 AND YOU COPY IT BY GOING FROM STRAND SEPARATING SO YOU KNOW IF IT DIDN'T WORK
JamesWatson_2005@671.97:674.48 YOU MIGHT AS WELL BELIEVE IT BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER SCHEME
JamesWatson_2005@678.29:685.92 THAT'S NOT THE WAY MOST SCIENTISTS THINK MOST SCIENTISTS ARE REALLY RATHER DULL THEY SAID WE WON 'T THINK ABOUT IT UNTIL WE KNOW IT'S RIGHT
JamesWatson_2005@687.51:692.82 BUT YOU KNOW WE THOUGHT WELL IT'S AT LEAST NINETY FIVE PERCENT RIGHT OR NINETY NINE PERCENT RIGHT SO THINK ABOUT
JamesWatson_2005@694.19:705.25 THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THERE WERE ESSENTIALLY SOMETHING LIKE FIVE REFERENCES TO OUR WORK IN NATURE NONE AND SO WE WERE LEFT BY OURSELVES AND TRYING TO DO THE LAST
JamesWatson_2005@705.46:717.90 PART OF THE TRIO HOW DO YOU WHAT DOES THIS GENETIC INFORMATION DO IT WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT IT PROVIDED THE INFORMATION TO AN RNA MOLECULE AND THEN HOW DO YOU GO FROM
JamesWatson_2005@735.61:742.03 SO THERE'S A PICTURE OF FRANCIS AND I BEFORE I MET THE GIRL SO I'M STILL LOOKING HAPPY
JamesWatson_2005@744.37:751.48 THERE IS WHAT WE DID WHEN WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO FORWARD WE FORMED A CLUB AND CALLED IT THE
JamesWatson_2005@754.46:762.49 PHYSICIST HE DESIGNED THE TIE HE WAS ONE OF THE MEMBERS THE QUESTION WAS HOW DO YOU GO FROM A FOUR LETTER CODE TO THE TWENTY LETTER CODE
JamesWatson_2005@763.47:768.13 PROTEINS FEYNMAN WAS A MEMBER AND TELLER AND FRIENDS
JamesWatson_2005@770.76:780.41 THAT'S THE ONLY NO WE WERE ONLY PHOTOGRAPHED TWICE AND ON BOTH OCCASIONS YOU KNOW ONE OF US WAS MISSING THE TIE THERE'S FRANCIS UP ON THE UPPER RIGHT
JamesWatson_2005@794.34:798.10 OF FORCED I THINK BECAUSE THE GIRL I HAD BOY
JamesWatson_2005@802.59:804.49 AND SO
JamesWatson_2005@804.57:810.05 I DIDN'T REALLY GET HAPPY UNTIL ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY BECAUSE THEN WE FOUND OUT
JamesWatson_2005@817.98:824.50 AND THAT LET MARSHALL NIRENBERG YOU KNOW TAKE RNA SYNTHETIC RNA PUT IT IN A SYSTEM
JamesWatson_2005@831.75:837.77 SO THAT'S THE FIRST CRACKING OF THE GENETIC CODE AND IT WAS ALL
JamesWatson_2005@840.09:847.37 SO THERE THAT'S WHAT CHRIS WANTED ME TO DO IT WAS SO WHAT HAPPENED SINCE THEN WELL AT THAT TIME
JamesWatson_2005@849.07:860.17 SHOULD GO BACK WHEN WE FOUND THE STRUCTURE OF DNA I GAVE MY FIRST TALK AT COLD SPRING HARBOR THE PHYSICIST LEO SZILARD HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID ARE YOU GOING TO PATENT
JamesWatson_2005@862.24:867.53 BUT HE KNEW PATENT LAW AND THAT WE COULDN'T PATENT IT BECAUSE YOU COULDN 'T NO USE FOR
JamesWatson_2005@869.78:870.84 AND SO
JamesWatson_2005@871.39:880.97 A USEFUL MOLECULE AND THE LAWYERS DIDN'T ENTER INTO THE EQUATION UNTIL ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE TWENTY YEARS LATER WHEN BOYER AND
JamesWatson_2005@890.28:900.99 YOU KNOW COULD DO USEFUL THINGS AND THEN THEY LEARNED HOW TO READ THE LETTERS FOR THE CODE AND BOOM WE 'VE YOU KNOW HAD A BIOTECH INDUSTRY AND
JamesWatson_2005@903.68:910.67 BUT WE WERE STILL A LONG WAYS FROM YOU KNOW ANSWERING A QUESTION WHICH SORT OF DOMINATED MY CHILDHOOD WHICH IS
JamesWatson_2005@911.97:916.70 HOW DO YOU NATURE NURTURE AND SO I'LL GO ON I'M
JamesWatson_2005@917.70:924.93 OUT OF TIME BUT THIS IS MICHAEL WIGLER A VERY VERY CLEVER MATHEMATICIAN TURNED PHYSICIST AND HE DEVELOPED A TECHNIQUE WHICH
JamesWatson_2005@939.52:945.06 WAY AHEAD OF AFFYMETRIX AND WE USE THEIR TECHNIQUE AND WHAT YOU CAN
JamesWatson_2005@945.21:951.61 DO IS SORT OF COMPARE DNA OF NORMAL SEGS VERSUS CANCER AND YOU CAN SEE
JamesWatson_2005@951.89:963.69 THE TOP THAT CANCERS WHICH ARE BAD SHOW INSERTIONS OR DELETIONS SO THE DNA IS REALLY BADLY MUCKED UP WHEREAS IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE OF SURVIVING THE DNA ISN'T SO
JamesWatson_2005@964.91:976.88 SO WE THINK THAT THIS WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO WHAT WE CALL DNA BIOPSIES BEFORE YOU GET TREATED FOR CANCER YOU SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT THIS TECHNIQUE AND GET A FEELING OF THE FACE OF THE ENEMY IT'S NOT
JamesWatson_2005@977.68:987.70 IT'S ONLY A PARTIAL LOOK BUT IT'S A I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY USEFUL SO WE STARTED WITH BREAST CANCER BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF MONEY FOR IT NO GOVERNMENT MONEY
JamesWatson_2005@988.49:995.37 AND NOW I HAVE A SORT OF VESTED INTEREST I WANT TO DO IT FOR PROSTATE CANCER SO YOU KNOW YOU
JamesWatson_2005@1000.92:1011.55 CANCER CELLS LOOKED AT NORMAL CELLS AND MADE A PRETTY SORT OF SURPRISING OBSERVATION WHICH IS ALL OF US HAVE ABOUT TEN PLACES IN OUR GENOME WHERE WE'VE LOST A GENE OR GAINED ANOTHER ONE
JamesWatson_2005@1013.70:1018.43 SO WE'RE SORT OF ALL IMPERFECT AND THE QUESTION IS WELL
JamesWatson_2005@1019.64:1028.67 AROUND HERE YOU KNOW THESE LITTLE LOSSES OR GAINS MIGHT NOT BE TOO BAD BUT IF THESE DELETIONS OR AMPLIFICATIONS OCCURRED IN THE WRONG GENE MAYBE
JamesWatson_2005@1030.76:1035.33 SO THE FIRST DISEASE HE LOOKED AT FOR IS AUTISM AND
JamesWatson_2005@1036.31:1046.44 REASON WE LOOKED AT AUTISM IS WE HAD THE MONEY TO DO IT LOOKING AT AN INDIVIDUAL IS ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THE PARENT OF A CHILD WITH ASPERGER 'S DISEASE THE HIGH INTELLIGENCE AUTISM
JamesWatson_2005@1048.28:1057.74 THING TO A CONVENTIONAL COMPANY THEY DIDN'T DO IT COULDN'T DO IT BY CONVENTIONAL GENETICS BUT JUST SCANNING IT WE BEGAN TO FIND GENES FOR AUTISM AND YOU CAN SEE HERE
JamesWatson_2005@1058.98:1068.69 THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM SO A LOT OF AUTISTIC KIDS ARE AUTISTIC BECAUSE THEY JUST LOST A BIG PIECE OF DNA I MEAN BIG PIECE AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL
JamesWatson_2005@1068.98:1079.11 WE SAW ONE AUTISTIC KID ABOUT FIVE MILLION BASES JUST MISSING FROM ONE OF HIS CHROMOSOMES WE HAVEN'T YET LOOKED AT THE PARENTS BUT THE PARENTS PROBABLY DON'T HAVE THAT LOSS OR THEY WOULDN'T BE PARENTS
JamesWatson_2005@1082.40:1089.69 SO OUR AUTISM STUDY IS JUST BEGINNING WE GOT THREE MILLION DOLLARS I THINK IT WILL COST AT LEAST TEN TO TWENTY BEFORE
JamesWatson_2005@1090.15:1100.93 YOU'D BE IN A POSITION TO HELP PARENTS WHO 'VE HAD AN AUTISTIC CHILD OR THINK THEY MAY HAVE AN AUTISTIC CHILD AND CAN WE SPOT THE DIFFERENCE SO THIS SAME TECHNIQUE SHOULD PROBABLY LOOK AT ALL
JamesWatson_2005@1102.08:1109.20 IT'S A WONDERFUL WAY TO FIND GENES AND SO I'LL CONCLUDE BY SAYING WE'VE LOOKED AT TWENTY PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA
JamesWatson_2005@1109.82:1117.64 AND WE THOUGHT WE'D PROBABLY HAVE TO LOOK AT SEVERAL HUNDRED BEFORE WE GOT THE PICTURE BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S SEVEN OUT OF TWENTY HAD A CHANGE WHICH WAS
JamesWatson_2005@1118.48:1126.76 VERY HIGH AND YET IN THE CONTROLS THERE WERE THREE SO WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THE CONTROLS WERE THEY CRAZY ALSO AND WE DIDN'T KNOW IT OR YOU KNOW WERE THEY
JamesWatson_2005@1132.94:1138.02 WHAT WE THINK IN SCHIZOPHRENIA IS THERE ARE GENES OF PREDISPOSURE AND
JamesWatson_2005@1139.60:1152.92 WHETHER THIS IS ONE THAT PREDISPOSES AND THEN THERE'S ONLY A SUB SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION THAT'S CAPABLE OF BEING SCHIZOPHRENIC NOW WE DON'T HAVE REALLY ANY EVIDENCE OF
JamesWatson_2005@1154.11:1157.27 BUT I THINK TO GIVE YOU A HYPOTHESIS THE BEST GUESS
JamesWatson_2005@1159.34:1167.16 IS THAT IF YOU'RE LEFT HANDED YOU'RE PRONE TO SCHIZOPHRENIA THIRTY PERCENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIC PEOPLE ARE LEFT HANDED
JamesWatson_2005@1167.49:1180.47 AND SCHIZOPHRENIA HAS A VERY FUNNY GENETICS WHICH MEANS SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE GENETICALLY LEFT HANDED BUT ONLY HALF OF IT SHOWED I DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO SAY NOW SOME PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY'RE RIGHT HANDED ARE GENETICALLY LEFT
JamesWatson_2005@1183.28:1191.96 OK I'M JUST SAYING THAT IF YOU THINK OH I DON'T CARRY A LEFT HANDED GENE SO THEREFORE MY YOU KNOW CHILDREN WON 'T BE AT RISK OF SCHIZOPHRENIA YOU MIGHT
JamesWatson_2005@1195.35:1195.70 SO
JamesWatson_2005@1196.18:1202.71 ME AN EXTRAORDINARILY EXCITING TIME WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO FIND THE GENE FOR BIPOLAR THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP AND
JamesWatson_2005@1202.98:1205.67 IF I HAD ENOUGH MONEY WE'D FIND THEM ALL THIS YEAR
