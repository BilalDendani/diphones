ShuklaBose_2009I@82.82:92.94 AND CAME BACK HOME REALLY TIRED EXHAUSTED BUT WITH IMAGES OF BRIGHT FACES TWINKLING EYES AND
ShuklaBose_2009I@93.43:99.93 WENT TO SLEEP WE WERE ALL EXCITED TO START BUT THE NUMBERS
ShuklaBose_2009I@101.63:107.57 TWO HUNDRED MILLION CHILDREN BETWEEN FOUR TO FOURTEEN THAT SHOULD BE GOING TO SCHOOL BUT DO NOT

ShuklaBose_2009I@149.16:159.28 AND WE WERE CONSTANTLY ASKED WHEN WILL YOU START HOW MANY SCHOOLS WILL YOU START HOW MANY CHILDREN WILL YOU GET HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SCALE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO REPLICATE
ShuklaBose_2009I@159.85:168.26 IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT NOT TO GET SCARED NOT TO GET DAUNTED BUT WE DUG OUR HEELS AND SAID WE 'RE NOT IN THE NUMBER GAME
ShuklaBose_2009I@169.01:175.55 WE WANT TO TAKE ONE CHILD AT A TIME AND TAKE THE CHILD RIGHT THROUGH SCHOOL
ShuklaBose_2009I@176.26:183.74 TO COLLEGE AND GET THEM PREPARED FOR BETTER LIVING A HIGH VALUE JOB

ShuklaBose_2009I@419.86:427.99 ALSO THIS MYTH THAT PARENTS FROM THE SLUMS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THEIR CHILDREN GOING TO SCHOOL THEY'D MUCH RATHER
ShuklaBose_2009I@428.49:436.88 THEM TO WORK THAT'S ABSOLUTE HOGWASH ALL PARENTS ALL OVER THE WORLD WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO LEAD A BETTER LIFE THAN THEMSELVES

ShuklaBose_2009I@574.72:583.98 CHILDREN ARE EATING THEIR FOOD BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE GOT RESPECT AND THEY FEEL THAT THEY ARE DOING SOMETHING WORTHWHILE
ShuklaBose_2009I@584.48:597.09 MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF OUR NON TEACHING STAFF ARE ALL PARENTS AND EXTENDED FAMILIES WE'VE STARTED MANY PROGRAMS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CHILD COMES TO SCHOOL
ShuklaBose_2009I@614.68:620.67 ONE OF THE TWENTY EIGHT CHILDREN FROM ALL PRIVILEGE SCHOOLS BEST SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY

ShuklaBose_2009I@762.18:772.75 LAST YEAR THERE WERE A COUPLE OF KIDS FROM ELITE SCHOOLS THAT CAME TO ASK FOR ADMISSIONS IN OUR SCHOOL WE ALSO HAVE OUR VERY OWN DREAM TEAM
ShuklaBose_2009I@773.22:786.24 WHY IS THIS HAPPENING WHY IS THIS CONFIDENCE IS IT THE EXPOSURE WE HAVE PROFESSORS FROM MIT BERKELEY STANFORD INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE WHO COME AND TEACH OUR CHILDREN
ShuklaBose_2009I@786.82:798.59 LOTS OF SCIENTIFIC FORMULAS EXPERIMENTS MUCH BEYOND THE CLASSROOM ART MUSIC ARE CONSIDERED THERAPY AND MEDIUMS OF EXPRESSION
ShuklaBose_2009I@799.47:806.48 WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT'S THE CONTENT THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT IT IS
ShuklaBose_2009I@808.27:816.57 NOT THE INFRASTRUCTURE NOT THE TOILETS NOT THE LIBRARIES BUT IT IS WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN THIS SCHOOL THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT
ShuklaBose_2009I@817.88:825.35 CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT OF LEARNING OF INQUIRY OF EXPLORATION IS WHAT IS TRUE EDUCATION
ShuklaBose_2009I@825.81:833.38 WHEN WE STARTED PARIKRMA WE HAD NO IDEA WHICH DIRECTION WE WERE TAKING WE DIDN'T HIRE MCKINSEY TO DO A BUSINESS PLAN
ShuklaBose_2009I@834.54:844.87 BUT WE KNOW FOR SURE THAT WHAT WE WANT TO DO TODAY IS TAKE ONE CHILD AT A TIME NOT GET BOGGED WITH NUMBERS
ShuklaBose_2009I@845.20:854.19 AND ACTUALLY SEE THE CHILD COMPLETE THE CIRCLE OF LIFE AND UNLEASH HIS TOTAL POTENTIAL
ShuklaBose_2009I@855.34:863.90 WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN SCALE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN QUALITY AND SCALE AND NUMBERS WILL AUTOMATICALLY HAPPEN
ShuklaBose_2009I@864.21:874.37 WE HAVE CORPORATES THAT HAVE STOOD BEHIND US AND WE ARE ABLE TO NOW OPEN MORE SCHOOLS BUT WE BEGAN WITH THE IDEA OF ONE CHILD AT A TIME
