SimonSinek_2009X@16.79:21.27 HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN WHEN THINGS DON'T GO AS WE ASSUME OR BETTER
SimonSinek_2009X@29.11:30.76 WHY IS APPLE SO INNOVATIVE
SimonSinek_2009X@31.59:36.37 YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR THEY'RE MORE INNOVATIVE THAN ALL THEIR COMPETITION
SimonSinek_2009X@36.92:45.47 AND YET THEY'RE JUST A COMPUTER COMPANY THEY'RE JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE THEY HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO THE SAME TALENT THE SAME AGENCIES THE SAME CONSULTANTS THE SAME MEDIA
SimonSinek_2009X@45.98:49.31 THEN WHY IS IT THAT THEY SEEM TO HAVE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
SimonSinek_2009X@50.38:54.09 WHY IS IT THAT MARTIN LUTHER KING LED THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
SimonSinek_2009X@54.66:58.36 HE WASN'T THE ONLY MAN WHO SUFFERED IN A PRE CIVIL RIGHTS AMERICA
SimonSinek_2009X@62.74:72.05 AND WHY IS IT THAT THE WRIGHT BROTHERS WERE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT CONTROL POWERED MANNED FLIGHT WHEN THERE WERE CERTAINLY OTHER TEAMS WHO WERE BETTER QUALIFIED BETTER FUNDED
SimonSinek_2009X@73.40:74.90 AND THEY DIDN'T ACHIEVE
SimonSinek_2009X@75.86:77.98 POWERED MAN FLIGHT AND THE WRIGHT BROTHERS BEAT THEM TO IT
SimonSinek_2009X@82.25:83.45 THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO
SimonSinek_2009X@90.08:94.41 HOW I THOUGHT THE WORLD WORKED AND IT EVEN PROFOUNDLY CHANGED THE WAY IN WHICH I OPERATE IN
SimonSinek_2009X@108.61:111.29 AND COMMUNICATE THE EXACT SAME WAY
SimonSinek_2009X@111.74:113.08 AND IT'S THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE
SimonSinek_2009X@115.64:116.96 ALL I DID WAS CODIFY IT
SimonSinek_2009X@117.94:123.12 AND IT'S PROBABLY THE WORLD 'S SIMPLEST IDEA I CALL IT THE GOLDEN CIRCLE
SimonSinek_2009X@131.88:133.37 WHY HOW WHAT
SimonSinek_2009X@134.21:148.34 THIS LITTLE IDEA EXPLAINS WHY SOME ORGANIZATIONS AND SOME LEADERS ARE ABLE TO INSPIRE WHERE OTHERS AREN 'T LET ME DEFINE THE TERMS REALLY QUICKLY EVERY SINGLE PERSON EVERY SINGLE ORGANIZATION ON THE PLANET KNOWS WHAT THEY DO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT
SimonSinek_2009X@149.42:154.99 SOME KNOW HOW THEY DO IT WHETHER YOU CALL IT YOUR DIFFERENTIATED VALUE PROPOSITION OR YOUR PROPRIETARY PROCESS OR
SimonSinek_2009X@156.48:160.62 VERY VERY FEW PEOPLE OR ORGANIZATIONS KNOW WHY THEY DO WHAT THEY DO
SimonSinek_2009X@161.13:162.81 AND BY WHY I DON'T MEAN TO MAKE A PROFIT
SimonSinek_2009X@169.90:170.84 WHY DOES YOUR
SimonSinek_2009X@175.87:177.46 AND WHY SHOULD ANYONE CARE
SimonSinek_2009X@178.28:185.27 WELL AS A RESULT THE WAY WE THINK THE WAY WE ACT THE WAY WE COMMUNICATE IS FROM THE OUTSIDE IN IT'S OBVIOUS WE GO FROM THE CLEAREST THING TO THE FUZZIEST THING
SimonSinek_2009X@190.14:192.84 REGARDLESS OF THEIR SIZE REGARDLESS OF THEIR INDUSTRY
SimonSinek_2009X@198.15:201.90 GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE I USE APPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND EVERYBODY GETS
SimonSinek_2009X@202.86:205.22 IF APPLE WERE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
SimonSinek_2009X@205.90:208.21 A MARKETING MESSAGE FROM THEM MIGHT SOUND LIKE THIS
SimonSinek_2009X@209.09:210.57 WE MAKE GREAT COMPUTERS
SimonSinek_2009X@218.90:232.41 AND THAT'S HOW MOST OF US COMMUNICATE THAT'S HOW MOST MARKETING IS DONE THAT'S HOW MOST SALES ARE DONE AND THAT'S HOW MOST OF US COMMUNICATE INTERPERSONALLY WE SAY WHAT WE DO WE SAY HOW WE'RE DIFFERENT OR HOW WE'RE BETTER AND WE EXPECT SOME SORT OF A BEHAVIOR A PURCHASE A VOTE SOMETHING LIKE THAT HERE 'S OUR NEW LAW FIRM
SimonSinek_2009X@251.90:254.47 IN CHALLENGING THE STATUS QUO WE BELIEVE
SimonSinek_2009X@257.08:261.24 THE WAY WE CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO IS BY MAKING OUR PRODUCTS BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED
SimonSinek_2009X@271.06:283.37 ALL I DID WAS REVERSE THE ORDER OF INFORMATION WHAT IT PROVES TO US IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T BUY WHAT YOU DO PEOPLE BUY WHY YOU DO IT PEOPLE DON'T BUY WHAT YOU DO THEY BUY WHY YOU DO IT THIS EXPLAINS WHY EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS ROOM
SimonSinek_2009X@287.45:294.13 BUT WE'RE ALSO PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE BUYING AN MP THREE PLAYER FROM APPLE OR A PHONE FROM APPLE OR A DVR FROM APPLE
SimonSinek_2009X@294.58:307.99 BUT AS I SAID BEFORE APPLE 'S JUST A COMPUTER COMPANY THERE'S NOTHING THAT DISTINGUISHES THEM STRUCTURALLY FROM ANY OF THEIR COMPETITORS THEIR COMPETITORS ARE ALL EQUALLY QUALIFIED TO MAKE ALL OF THESE PRODUCTS IN FACT THEY TRIED A FEW YEARS AGO GATEWAY CAME OUT WITH FLAT SCREEN TVS
SimonSinek_2009X@308.45:312.73 THEY'RE EMINENTLY QUALIFIED TO MAKE FLAT SCREEN TVS THEY'VE BEEN MAKING FLAT SCREEN MONITORS FOR YEARS
SimonSinek_2009X@320.50:329.48 CAME OUT WITH MP THREE PLAYERS AND PDAS AND THEY MAKE GREAT QUALITY PRODUCTS AND THEY CAN MAKE PERFECTLY WELL DESIGNED PRODUCTS AND NOBODY BOUGHT ONE
SimonSinek_2009X@330.18:337.56 IN FACT TALKING ABOUT IT NOW WE CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE BUYING AN MP THREE PLAYER FROM DELL WHY WOULD YOU BUY AN MP THREE PLAYER FROM A COMPUTER COMPANY BUT WE DO IT EVERY DAY
SimonSinek_2009X@348.32:350.09 WHO BELIEVE WHAT YOU BELIEVE
SimonSinek_2009X@351.26:360.48 HERE 'S THE BEST PART NONE OF WHAT I'M TELLING YOU IS MY OPINION IT'S ALL GROUNDED IN THE TENETS OF BIOLOGY NOT PSYCHOLOGY BIOLOGY
SimonSinek_2009X@360.77:373.20 IF YOU LOOK AT A CROSS SECTION OF THE HUMAN BRAIN LOOKING FROM THE TOP DOWN WHAT YOU SEE IS THE HUMAN BRAIN IS ACTUALLY BROKEN INTO THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS THAT CORRELATE PERFECTLY WITH THE GOLDEN CIRCLE OUR NEWEST BRAIN OUR HOMO SAPIEN BRAIN
SimonSinek_2009X@386.46:394.70 AND OUR LIMBIC BRAINS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF OUR FEELINGS LIKE TRUST AND LOYALTY IT'S ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL HUMAN BEHAVIOR
SimonSinek_2009X@445.71:456.22 OTHER BODY PARTS CONTROLLING YOUR BEHAVIOR IT'S ALL HAPPENING HERE IN YOU LIMBIC BRAIN THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT CONTROLS DECISION MAKING AND NOT LANGUAGE BUT IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DO WHAT YOU DO
SimonSinek_2009X@456.53:466.25 AND PEOPLE RESPOND TO WHY YOU DO WHAT YOU DO THEN HOW YOU EVER GET PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR YOU OR BUY SOMETHING FROM YOU OR MORE IMPORTANTLY BE LOYAL
SimonSinek_2009X@466.76:475.14 AND WANT TO BE A PART OF WHAT IT IS THAT YOU DO AGAIN THE GOAL IS NOT JUST TO SELL TO PEOPLE WHO NEED WHAT YOU HAVE THE GOAL IS TO SELL TO PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE WHAT YOU BELIEVE
SimonSinek_2009X@475.77:483.47 THE GOAL IS NOT JUST TO HIRE PEOPLE WHO NEED A JOB IT'S TO HIRED PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE WHAT YOU BELIEVE I ALWAYS SAY THAT
SimonSinek_2009X@483.88:494.26 YOU KNOW IF YOU HIRE PEOPLE JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN DO A JOB THEY'LL WORK FOR YOUR MONEY BUT IF YOU HIRE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE WHAT YOU BELIEVE THEY'LL WORK FOR YOUR YOU WITH BLOOD AND SWEAT AND TEARS
SimonSinek_2009X@494.64:504.09 AND NOWHERE ELSE IS THERE A BETTER EXAMPLE OF THIS THAN WITH THE WRIGHT BROTHERS MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT SAMUEL PIERPONT LANGLEY AND BACK IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY
SimonSinek_2009X@504.57:512.22 THE PURSUIT OF POWERED MAN FLIGHT WAS LIKE THE DOT COM OF THE DAY EVERYBODY WAS TRYING IT AND SAMUEL PIERPONT LANGLEY HAD WHAT WE ASSUME
SimonSinek_2009X@512.54:522.42 TO BE THE RECIPE FOR SUCCESS I MEAN EVEN NOW YOU ASK PEOPLE WHY DID YOUR PRODUCT OR WHY DID YOUR COMPANY FAIL AND PEOPLE ALWAYS GIVE YOU THE SAME PERMUTATION OF THE SAME THREE THINGS
SimonSinek_2009X@523.07:531.32 UNDER CAPITALIZED THE WRONG PEOPLE BAD MARKET CONDITIONS IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME THREE THINGS SO LET 'S EXPLORE THAT SAMUEL PIERPONT LANGLEY
SimonSinek_2009X@545.14:555.64 HE HIRED THE BEST MINDS MONEY COULD FIND AND THE MARKET CONDITIONS WERE FANTASTIC THE NEW YORK TIMES FOLLOWED HIM AROUND EVERYWHERE AND EVERYONE WAS ROOTING FOR LANGLEY
SimonSinek_2009X@556.41:558.88 HOW COME YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF SAMUEL PIERPONT LANGLEY
SimonSinek_2009X@559.82:562.04 A FEW HUNDRED MILES AWAY IN DAYTON OHIO
SimonSinek_2009X@563.11:566.38 ORVILLE AND WILBUR WRIGHT THEY HAD NONE
SimonSinek_2009X@566.49:575.40 OF WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE THE RECIPE FOR SUCCESS THEY HAD NO MONEY THEY PAID FOR THEIR DREAM WITH THE PROCEEDS FROM THEIR BICYCLE SHOP NOT A SINGLE PERSON ON THE WRIGHT BROTHERS TEAM
SimonSinek_2009X@575.59:582.02 HAD A COLLEGE EDUCATION NOT EVEN ORVILLE OR WILBUR AND THE NEW YORK TIMES FOLLOWED THEM AROUND NOWHERE
SimonSinek_2009X@582.90:594.06 THE DIFFERENCE WAS ORVILLE AND WILBUR WERE DRIVEN BY A CAUSE BY A PURPOSE BY A BELIEF THEY BELIEVED THAT IF THEY COULD FIGURE OUT THIS FLYING MACHINE IT'LL CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE WORLD
SimonSinek_2009X@604.53:614.17 AND LO AND BEHOLD LOOK WHAT HAPPENED THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED IN THE WRIGHT BROTHERS DREAM WORKED WITH THEM WITH BLOOD AND SWEAT AND TEARS THE OTHERS JUST WORKED FOR THE PAYCHECK
SimonSinek_2009X@630.25:634.46 AND NO ONE WAS THERE TO EVEN EXPERIENCE IT WE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT A FEW DAYS LATER
SimonSinek_2009X@636.20:644.79 AND FURTHER PROOF THAT LANGLEY WAS MOTIVATED BY THE WRONG THING THE DAY THE WRIGHT BROTHERS TOOK FLIGHT HE QUIT HE COULD HAVE SAID
SimonSinek_2009X@662.31:665.41 WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO ATTRACT THOSE WHO BELIEVE WHAT YOU BELIEVE
SimonSinek_2009X@670.09:681.73 IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE LAW YOU DEFINITELY KNOW THE TERMINOLOGY THE FIRST TWO AND A HALF PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION ARE OUR INNOVATORS THE NEXT THIRTEEN AND A HALF PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION ARE OUR EARLY ADOPTERS
SimonSinek_2009X@694.77:705.26 WE ALL SIT AT VARIOUS PLACES AT VARIOUS TIMES ON THIS SCALE BUT WHAT THE LAW OF DIFFUSION OF INNOVATION TELLS US IS THAT IF YOU WANT MASS MARKET SUCCESS OR MASS MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF AN IDEA
SimonSinek_2009X@705.78:715.33 YOU CANNOT HAVE IT UNTIL YOU ACHIEVE THIS TIPPING POINT BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND EIGHTEEN PERCENT MARKET PENETRATION AND THEN THE SYSTEM TIPS
SimonSinek_2009X@715.54:728.41 AND I LOVE ASKING BUSINESSES WHAT 'S YOUR CONVERSION ON NEW BUSINESS AND THEY LOVE TO TELL YOU OH IT'S ABOUT TEN PERCENT PROUDLY WELL YOU CAN TRIP OVER TEN PERCENT OF THE CUSTOMERS WE ALL HAVE ABOUT TEN PERCENT WHO JUST GET IT THAT'S HOW WE DESCRIBE THEM RIGHT THAT'S LIKE THAT GUT FEELING OH THEY JUST GET IT THE PROBLEM IS HOW DO YOU
SimonSinek_2009X@728.83:740.72 FIND THE ONES THAT GET IT BEFORE YOU'RE DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM VERSUS THE ONES WHO DON'T GET IT SO IT'S THIS HERE THIS LITTLE GAP THAT YOU HAVE TO CLOSE AS JEFFREY MOORE CALLS IT CROSSING THE CHASM
SimonSinek_2009X@741.22:751.29 BECAUSE YOU SEE THE EARLY MAJORITY WILL NOT TRY SOMETHING UNTIL SOMEONE ELSE HAS TRIED IT FIRST AND THESE GUYS THE INNOVATORS AND THE EARLY ADOPTERS
SimonSinek_2009X@751.49:759.37 THEY'RE COMFORTABLE MAKING THOSE GUT DECISIONS THEY'RE MORE COMFORTABLE MAKING THOSE INTUITIVE DECISIONS THAT ARE DRIVEN BY WHAT THEY BELIEVE ABOUT THE WORLD
SimonSinek_2009X@760.61:770.09 AND NOT JUST WHAT PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO STOOD ON LINE FOR SIX HOURS TO BUY AN IPHONE WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT WHEN YOU COULD HAVE JUST WALKED INTO THE STORE THE NEXT WEEK AND BOUGHT ONE OFF THE SHELF
SimonSinek_2009X@770.46:777.43 THESE ARE THE PEOPLE FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON FLAT SCREEN TVS WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT EVEN THOUGH THE TECHNOLOGY WAS SUBSTANDARD
SimonSinek_2009X@790.35:791.66 PROVES WHAT YOU BELIEVE
SimonSinek_2009X@797.19:802.92 PERSON BOUGHT THE IPHONE IN THE FIRST SIX HOURS STOOD IN LINE FOR SIX HOURS
SimonSinek_2009X@803.67:811.11 WAS BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY BELIEVED ABOUT THE WORLD AND HOW THEY WANTED EVERYBODY TO SEE THEM THEY WERE FIRST PEOPLE DON'T BUY WHAT YOU DO THEY BUY WHY YOU DO IT
SimonSinek_2009X@811.41:819.29 SO LET ME GIVE YOU A FAMOUS EXAMPLE A FAMOUS FAILURE AND A FAMOUS SUCCESS OF THE LAW OF DIFFUSION OF INNOVATION FIRST THE FAMOUS FAILURE
SimonSinek_2009X@819.88:829.79 IT'S A COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE AS WE SAID BEFORE A SECOND AGO THE RECIPE FOR SUCCESS IS MONEY AND THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND THE RIGHT MARKET CONDITIONS RIGHT YOU SHOULD HAVE SUCCESS THEN LOOK AT TIVO
SimonSinek_2009X@841.07:848.88 THEY WERE EXTREMELY WELL FUNDED MARKET CONDITIONS WERE FANTASTIC I MEAN WE USE TIVO AS VERB I TIVO STUFF ON MY PIECE OF JUNK TIME WARNER DVR ALL THE TIME
SimonSinek_2009X@852.53:856.05 'S A COMMERCIAL FAILURE THEY'VE NEVER MADE MONEY
SimonSinek_2009X@856.49:862.52 AND WHEN THEY WENT IPO THEIR STOCK WAS AT ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY DOLLARS AND THEN PLUMMETED AND IT'S NEVER TRADED ABOVE TEN
SimonSinek_2009X@862.85:871.44 IN FACT I DON'T EVEN THINK IT'S TRADED ABOVE SIX EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE OF LITTLE SPIKES BECAUSE YOU SEE WHEN TIVO LAUNCHED THEIR PRODUCT THEY TOLD US ALL WHAT THEY HAD
SimonSinek_2009X@872.14:882.10 THEY SAID WE HAVE A PRODUCT THAT PAUSES LIVE TV SKIPS COMMERCIALS REWINDS LIVE TV AND MEMORIZES YOUR VIEWING HABITS WITHOUT YOU EVEN ASKING
SimonSinek_2009X@895.75:903.36 WHO LIKES TO HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE BOY DO WE HAVE A PRODUCT FOR YOU
SimonSinek_2009X@904.13:908.39 IT PAUSES LIVE TV SKIPS COMMERCIALS MEMORIZES YOUR VIEWING HABITS ETC ETC
SimonSinek_2009X@924.68:930.13 TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE SHOWED UP ON THE MALL IN WASHINGTON TO HEAR DOCTOR KING SPEAK
SimonSinek_2009X@931.66:933.40 THEY SENT OUT NO INVITATIONS
SimonSinek_2009X@934.51:936.50 AND THERE WAS NO WEBSITE TO CHECK THE DATE
SimonSinek_2009X@950.49:956.10 HE HAD A GIFT HE DIDN'T GO AROUND TELLING PEOPLE WHAT NEEDED TO CHANGE IN AMERICA HE WENT AROUND
SimonSinek_2009X@956.46:963.74 PEOPLE WHAT HE BELIEVED I BELIEVE I BELIEVE I BELIEVE HE TOLD PEOPLE AND PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED WHAT HE BELIEVED
SimonSinek_2009X@964.16:971.61 TOOK HIS CAUSE AND THEY MADE IT THEIR OWN AND THEY TOLD PEOPLE AND SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE CREATED STRUCTURES TO GET THE WORD OUT TO EVEN MORE PEOPLE
SimonSinek_2009X@972.23:979.53 AND LOW AND BEHOLD TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE SHOWED UP ON THE RIGHT DAY AT THE RIGHT TIME TO HEAR HIM SPEAK
SimonSinek_2009X@980.41:985.50 HOW MANY OF THEM SHOWED UP FOR HIM ZERO
SimonSinek_2009X@988.68:1002.16 IT'S WHAT THEY BELIEVED ABOUT AMERICA THAT GOT THEM TO TRAVEL IN A BUS FOR EIGHT HOURS TO STAND IN THE SUN IN WASHINGTON IN THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST IT'S WHAT THEY BELIEVED AND IT WASN'T ABOUT BLACK VERSUS WHITE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE AUDIENCE WAS WHITE
SimonSinek_2009X@1002.96:1010.08 DOCTOR KING BELIEVED THAT THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF LAWS IN THIS WORLD THOSE THAT ARE MADE BY A HIGHER AUTHORITY AND THOSE THAT ARE MADE BY MAN
SimonSinek_2009X@1010.41:1017.27 AND NOT UNTIL ALL THE LAWS THAT ARE MADE BY MAN ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE LAWS THAT ARE MADE BY THE HIGHER AUTHORITY WILL WE LIVE IN A JUST WORLD
SimonSinek_2009X@1018.16:1023.57 IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS THE PERFECT THING TO HELP HIM BRING HIS CAUSE TO LIFE
SimonSinek_2009X@1024.42:1031.54 WE FOLLOWED NOT FOR HIM BUT FOR OURSELVES AND BY THE WAY HE GAVE THE I HAVE A DREAM SPEECH NOT THE I HAVE A PLAN SPEECH
SimonSinek_2009X@1040.59:1050.44 BECAUSE THERE ARE LEADERS AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO LEAD LEADERS HOLD A POSITION OF POWER OR AUTHORITY BUT THOSE WHO LEAD INSPIRE US
SimonSinek_2009X@1060.20:1064.57 WE FOLLOW THOSE WHO LEAD NOT FOR THEM BUT FOR OURSELVES
SimonSinek_2009X@1065.86:1072.71 AND IT'S THOSE WHO START WITH WHY THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO INSPIRE THOSE AROUND THEM
SimonSinek_2009X@1073.12:1077.37 OR FIND OTHERS WHO INSPIRE THEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH
