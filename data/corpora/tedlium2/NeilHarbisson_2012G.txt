NeilHarbisson_2012G@27.55:43.17 BECAUSE I COME FROM A GRAYSCALE WORLD TO ME THE SKY IS ALWAYS GRAY FLOWERS ARE ALWAYS GRAY AND TELEVISION IS STILL IN BLACK AND WHITE BUT SINCE THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE INSTEAD OF SEEING COLOR I CAN HEAR COLOR
NeilHarbisson_2012G@43.17:50.34 IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE I STARTED A PROJECT WITH COMPUTER SCIENTIST ADAM MONTANDON AND
NeilHarbisson_2012G@50.34:61.56 THE RESULT WITH FURTHER COLLABORATIONS WITH PETER KESE FROM SLOVENIA AND MATIAS LIZANA FROM BARCELONA IS THIS ELECTRONIC EYE IT 'S A COLOR SENSOR
NeilHarbisson_2012G@99.74:105.87 SO I 'VE BEEN HEARING COLOR ALL THE TIME FOR EIGHT YEARS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR SO I FIND
NeilHarbisson_2012G@124.86:135.32 FAVORITE COLORS AND I STARTED TO DREAM IN COLORS SO WHEN I STARTED TO DREAM IN COLOR IS WHEN I FELT THAT THE SOFTWARE AND MY BRAIN HAD UNITED BECAUSE
NeilHarbisson_2012G@135.32:141.17 IN MY DREAMS IT WAS MY BRAIN CREATING ELECTRONIC SOUNDS IT WASN 'T THE SOFTWARE SO
NeilHarbisson_2012G@141.18:155.34 THAT 'S WHEN I STARTED TO FEEL LIKE A CYBORG IT 'S WHEN I STARTED TO FEEL THAT THE CYBERNETIC DEVICE WAS NO LONGER A DEVICE IT HAD BECOME A PART OF MY BODY AN EXTENSION OF MY SENSES AND AFTER SOME TIME
NeilHarbisson_2012G@155.35:159.97 IT EVEN BECAME A PART OF MY OFFICIAL IMAGE
NeilHarbisson_2012G@178.86:183.59 SO LIFE HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY SINCE I HEAR COLOR BECAUSE
NeilHarbisson_2012G@183.59:185.9 COLOR IS ALMOST EVERYWHERE SO
NeilHarbisson_2012G@185.9:197.56 THE BIGGEST CHANGE FOR EXAMPLE IS GOING TO AN ART GALLERY I CAN LISTEN TO A PICASSO FOR EXAMPLE SO IT 'S LIKE I 'M GOING TO A CONCERT HALL BECAUSE I CAN LISTEN TO THE PAINTINGS
NeilHarbisson_2012G@197.56:207.48 AND SUPERMARKETS I FIND THIS IS VERY SHOCKING IT 'S VERY VERY ATTRACTIVE TO WALK ALONG A SUPERMARKET IT 'S LIKE GOING TO A NIGHTCLUB IT 'S FULL OF DIFFERENT MELODIES
NeilHarbisson_2012G@213.5:220.78 ALSO THE WAY I DRESS HAS CHANGED BEFORE I USED TO DRESS IN A WAY THAT IT LOOKED GOOD NOW I DRESS IN A WAY THAT IT SOUNDS GOOD
NeilHarbisson_2012G@247.01:263.7 ALSO FOOD THE WAY I LOOK AT FOOD HAS CHANGED BECAUSE NOW I CAN DISPLAY THE FOOD ON A PLATE SO I CAN EAT MY FAVORITE SONG LAUGHTER SO DEPENDING ON HOW I DISPLAY IT I CAN HEAR AND I CAN COMPOSE MUSIC WITH FOOD SO IMAGINE A RESTAURANT WHERE WE CAN HAVE
NeilHarbisson_2012G@263.7:267.42 LIKE LADY GAGA SALADS AS STARTERS
NeilHarbisson_2012G@285.79:288.57 BEAUTY HAS CHANGED BECAUSE
NeilHarbisson_2012G@288.58:304.97 WHEN I LOOK AT SOMEONE I HEAR THEIR FACE SO SOMEONE MIGHT LOOK VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT SOUND TERRIBLE LAUGHTER AND IT MIGHT HAPPEN THE OPPOSITE THE OTHER WAY AROUND SO I REALLY ENJOY CREATING LIKE SOUND PORTRAITS OF PEOPLE INSTEAD OF DRAWING SOMEONE 'S
NeilHarbisson_2012G@304.97:313.92 FACE LIKE DRAWING THE SHAPE I POINT AT THEM WITH THE EYE AND I WRITE DOWN THE DIFFERENT NOTES I HEAR AND THEN I CREATE SOUND PORTRAITS HERE 'S SOME FACES
NeilHarbisson_2012G@365.31:382.96 THAT NORMAL SOUNDS STARTED TO BECOME COLOR I HEARD A TELEPHONE TONE AND IT FELT GREEN BECAUSE IT SOUNDED JUST LIKE THE COLOR GREEN THE BBC BEEPS THEY SOUND TURQUOISE AND LISTENING TO MOZART BECAME A YELLOW EXPERIENCE SO I STARTED TO
NeilHarbisson_2012G@382.96:395.47 PAINT MUSIC AND PAINT PEOPLE 'S VOICES BECAUSE PEOPLE 'S VOICES HAVE FREQUENCIES THAT I RELATE TO COLOR AND HERE 'S SOME MUSIC TRANSLATED INTO COLOR
NeilHarbisson_2012G@447.57:450.81 AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MARTIN LUTHER KING
NeilHarbisson_2012G@450.81:463.64 SO I GOT TO A POINT WHEN I WAS ABLE TO PERCEIVE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY COLORS JUST LIKE HUMAN VISION I WAS ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE ALL THE DEGREES OF THE COLOR WHEEL BUT THEN I JUST
NeilHarbisson_2012G@463.64:481.14 THOUGHT THAT THIS HUMAN VISION WASN 'T GOOD ENOUGH THERE 'S MANY MANY MORE COLORS AROUND US THAT WE CANNOT PERCEIVE BUT THAT ELECTRONIC EYES CAN PERCEIVE SO I DECIDED TO CONTINUE EXTENDING MY COLOR SENSES AND I ADDED INFRARED AND I ADDED ULTRAVIOLET
NeilHarbisson_2012G@481.14:491.28 TO THE COLOR TO SOUND SCALE SO NOW I CAN HEAR COLORS THAT THE HUMAN EYE CANNOT PERCEIVE FOR EXAMPLE PERCEIVING INFRARED IS GOOD BECAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY
NeilHarbisson_2012G@536.7:555.41 I THINK LIFE WILL BE MUCH MORE EXCITING WHEN WE STOP CREATING APPLICATIONS FOR MOBILE PHONES AND WE START CREATING APPLICATIONS FOR OUR OWN BODY I THINK THIS WILL BE A BIG BIG CHANGE THAT WE WILL SEE DURING THIS CENTURY SO I DO ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO THINK ABOUT WHICH SENSES YOU 'D LIKE TO EXTEND
NeilHarbisson_2012G@555.41:560.9 I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO BECOME A CYBORG YOU WON 'T BE ALONE THANK YOU
