TonyPorter_2010W@28.08:31.07 PAIN NO EMOTIONS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
TonyPorter_2010W@31.77:36.63 ANGER AND DEFINITELY NO FEAR THAT MEN ARE IN CHARGE WHICH MEANS WOMEN ARE NOT
TonyPorter_2010W@39.26:47.17 AND YOU SHOULD JUST FOLLOW AND DO WHAT WE SAY THAT MEN ARE SUPERIOR WOMEN ARE INFERIOR THAT MEN ARE STRONG WOMEN
TonyPorter_2010W@49.19:49.90 THAT WOMEN
TonyPorter_2010W@53.37:59.08 MEN AND OBJECTS PARTICULARLY SEXUAL OBJECTS
TonyPorter_2010W@59.53:63.54 LATER COME TO KNOW THAT TO BE THE COLLECTIVE SOCIALIZATION OF MEN
TonyPorter_2010W@66.52:67.85 THE MAN BOX
TonyPorter_2010W@81.01:83.71 BEING A MAN BUT AT THE SAME TIME
TonyPorter_2010W@89.61:98.58 REALLY NEED TO BEGIN TO CHALLENGE LOOK AT IT AND REALLY GET IN THE PROCESS OF DECONSTRUCTING REDEFINING WHAT WE COME TO KNOW
TonyPorter_2010W@117.07:124.36 WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT FIVE AND SIX FOUR AND FIVE JAY COULD COME TO ME COME TO ME CRYING

TonyPorter_2010W@138.45:139.62 HE CAME TO ME CRYING
TonyPorter_2010W@148.55:152.26 BY THE TIME HE GOT TO ME I WAS ALREADY SAYING THINGS LIKE WHY

TonyPorter_2010W@212.07:218.42 MY BROTHER HENRY HE DIED TRAGICALLY WHEN WE WERE TEENAGERS WE LIVED IN NEW YORK CITY AS I SAID WE LIVED IN THE BRONX AT THE TIME
TonyPorter_2010W@225.29:229.91 CITY AND AS WE WERE PREPARING TO COME BACK FROM THE
TonyPorter_2010W@230.91:232.96 THE CARS STOPPED AT THE BATHROOM

TonyPorter_2010W@255.36:265.50 THAN TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO EXPRESS THESE FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS IN FRONT OF THE WOMEN AND THIS IS A MAN WHO TEN MINUTES AGO HAD JUST PUT HIS TEENAGE SON
TonyPorter_2010W@268.01:270.17 SOMETHING I JUST CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THE
TonyPorter_2010W@272.32:276.86 THAT STICKS WITH ME THE MOST IS THAT HE WAS APOLOGIZING TO ME
TonyPorter_2010W@278.45:279.30 IN FRONT OF ME
TonyPorter_2010W@280.05:283.24 AND AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS ALSO GIVING ME PROPS LIFTING ME UP
TonyPorter_2010W@287.07:290.68 I COME TO ALSO LOOK AT THIS AS THIS FEAR THAT WE
TonyPorter_2010W@293.36:296.71 PARALYZED HOLDING US HOSTAGE TO THIS MAN BOX
TonyPorter_2010W@297.73:301.34 I CAN REMEMBER SPEAKING TO A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY A FOOTBALL PLAYER

TonyPorter_2010W@321.58:322.61 AND I SAID TO MYSELF
TonyPorter_2010W@324.95:328.24 IF IT WOULD DESTROY HIM TO BE CALLED A GIRL
TonyPorter_2010W@329.21:331.51 WHAT ARE WE THEN TEACHING HIM
TonyPorter_2010W@332.67:333.99 ABOUT GIRLS
TonyPorter_2010W@338.91:342.68 IT TOOK ME BACK TO A TIME WHEN I WAS ABOUT TWELVE YEARS OLD
TonyPorter_2010W@344.02:350.02 IN TENEMENT BUILDINGS IN THE INNER CITY AT THIS TIME WE'RE LIVING IN THE BRONX AND IN THE BUILDING NEXT TO WHERE I LIVED THERE WAS A

TonyPorter_2010W@430.00:432.60 I NEVER HAD SEX WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT
TonyPorter_2010W@433.01:440.67 AS MEN YOU ONLY TELL YOUR DEAREST CLOSEST FRIEND SWORN TO SECRECY FOR LIFE THE FIRST TIME YOU HAD SEX FOR EVERYBODY ELSE WE GO AROUND LIKE WE'VE BEEN HAVING SEX
TonyPorter_2010W@453.46:456.23 ESPECIALLY SEXUAL OBJECTS ANYWAY
TonyPorter_2010W@456.92:464.01 I COULDN'T TELL HIM ANY OF THAT SO LIKE MY MOTHER WOULD SAY MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT I JUST SIMPLY SAID TO JOHNNY YES HE TOLD ME TO GO IN HIS ROOM I GO IN HIS ROOM
TonyPorter_2010W@465.17:468.74 IS A GIRL FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD NAMED SHEILA SHE'S SIXTEEN YEARS OLD SHE'S
TonyPorter_2010W@470.75:478.51 WHAT I KNOW TODAY TO BE MENTALLY ILL HIGHER FUNCTIONING AT TIMES THAN OTHERS WE HAD A WHOLE CHOICE 'S WORTH OF INAPPROPRIATE NAMES
TonyPorter_2010W@480.77:487.44 JUST GOTTEN THROUGH HAVING SEX WITH HER WELL ACTUALLY HE RAPED HER BUT HE WOULD SAY HE HAD SEX WITH HER BECAUSE WHILE SHEILA NEVER SAID
TonyPorter_2010W@488.15:496.42 NO SHE ALSO NEVER SAID YES SO HE WAS OFFERING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE SAME SO WHEN I GO IN THE ROOM I CLOSE THE DOOR FOLKS I'M PETRIFIED
TonyPorter_2010W@497.24:510.68 I STAND WITH MY BACK TO THE DOOR SO JOHNNY CAN'T BUST IN THE ROOM AND SEE THAT I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING AND I STAND THERE LONG ENOUGH THAT I COULD HAVE ACTUALLY DONE SOMETHING SO NOW I'M NO LONGER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS ROOM SO IN MY TWELVE YEARS
TonyPorter_2010W@512.12:518.05 I ZIP MY PANTS DOWN I WALK OUT INTO THE ROOM AND LO AND BEHOLD TO ME WHILE I WAS IN
TonyPorter_2010W@519.53:522.07 ROOM WITH SHEILA JOHNNY WAS BACK AT THE WINDOW CALLING GUYS
TonyPorter_2010W@522.96:528.51 SO NOW THERE'S A LIVING ROOM FULL OF GUYS IT WAS LIKE THE WAITING ROOM IN THE DOCTOR 'S OFFICE AND THEY ASKED ME HOW WAS
TonyPorter_2010W@529.72:531.25 AND I SAY TO THEM IT WAS GOOD
TonyPorter_2010W@532.28:534.78 AND I ZIP MY PANTS UP IN FRONT OF THEM AND I
TonyPorter_2010W@536.35:546.78 NOW I SAY THIS ALL WITH REMORSE AND I WAS FEELING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF REMORSE AT THAT TIME BUT I WAS CONFLICTED BECAUSE WHILE I WAS FEELING REMORSE I WAS EXCITED BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET CAUGHT BUT I KNEW I FELT BAD ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING
TonyPorter_2010W@547.55:556.53 THIS FEAR GETTING OUTSIDE THE MAN BOX TOTALLY ENVELOPED ME IT WAS WAY MORE IMPORTANT TO ME ABOUT ME AND MY MAN BOX
TonyPorter_2010W@557.64:562.25 THAN ABOUT SHEILA AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HER
TonyPorter_2010W@562.38:571.12 SEE COLLECTIVELY WE AS MEN ARE TAUGHT TO HAVE LESS VALUE IN WOMEN TO VIEW THEM AS PROPERTY AND THE OBJECTS OF MEN WE SEE THAT AS AN EQUATION THAT EQUALS VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
TonyPorter_2010W@572.23:574.07 WE AS MEN GOOD MEN THE
TonyPorter_2010W@575.89:583.33 WE OPERATE ON THE FOUNDATION OF THIS WHOLE COLLECTIVE SOCIALIZATION WE KIND OF SEE OURSELVES SEPARATE BUT WE'RE VERY MUCH A PART OF IT YOU SEE
TonyPorter_2010W@583.74:595.40 WE HAVE TO COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT LESS VALUE PROPERTY AND OBJECTIFICATION IS THE FOUNDATION AND THE VIOLENCE CAN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT IT SO WE'RE VERY MUCH A PART OF THE SOLUTION AS WELL AS THE PROBLEM
TonyPorter_2010W@595.48:604.06 THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL SAYS THAT MEN 'S VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IS AT EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS IS THE NUMBER ONE HEALTH CONCERN FOR WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY AND ABROAD
TonyPorter_2010W@604.68:606.34 SO QUICKLY I'D LIKE TO JUST SAY
