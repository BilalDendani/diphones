FabianOefner_2013G@42.7:48.65 SO BY NOW MY TALK IS ALREADY SIX THOUSAND WORDS LONG AND I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD STOP HERE
FabianOefner_2013G@51.43:68.28 AT THE SAME TIME I PROBABLY OWE YOU SOME EXPLANATION ABOUT THE IMAGES THAT YOU JUST SAW WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO AS A PHOTOGRAPHER AS AN ARTIST IS TO BRING THE WORLD OF ART AND SCIENCE TOGETHER WHETHER IT IS AN IMAGE OF A SOAP BUBBLE
FabianOefner_2013G@77.96:91.2 STRANGE LIQUIDS THAT BEHAVE IN VERY PECULIAR WAYS OR PAINT THAT IS MODELED BY CENTRIFUGAL FORCES I 'M ALWAYS TRYING TO LINK THOSE TWO FIELDS TOGETHER
FabianOefner_2013G@103.16:105.59 IF YOU LOOK AT SCIENCE ON ONE HAND
FabianOefner_2013G@105.59:116.64 SCIENCE IS A VERY RATIONAL APPROACH TO ITS SURROUNDINGS WHEREAS ART ON THE OTHER HAND IS USUALLY AN EMOTIONAL APPROACH TO ITS SURROUNDINGS
FabianOefner_2013G@128.26:133.19 LET ME DEMONSTRATE THIS BASED ON THREE PROJECTS
FabianOefner_2013G@133.19:143.82 THE FIRST ONE HAS TO DO WITH MAKING SOUND VISIBLE NOW AS YOU MAY KNOW SOUND TRAVELS IN WAVES SO IF YOU HAVE A SPEAKER
FabianOefner_2013G@159.66:165.73 NOW I WAS THINKING HOW CAN I MAKE THOSE SOUND WAVES VISIBLE
FabianOefner_2013G@165.73:178.37 SO I CAME UP WITH THE FOLLOWING SETUP I TOOK A SPEAKER I PLACED A THIN FOIL OF PLASTIC ON TOP OF THAT SPEAKER AND THEN I ADDED TINY LITTLE CRYSTALS ON TOP OF THAT SPEAKER
FabianOefner_2013G@178.37:189.43 AND NOW IF I WOULD PLAY A SOUND THROUGH THAT SPEAKER IT WOULD CAUSE THE CRYSTALS TO MOVE UP AND DOWN NOW THIS HAPPENS VERY FAST IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE
FabianOefner_2013G@189.43:202.67 SO TOGETHER WITH LG WE CAPTURED THIS MOTION WITH A CAMERA THAT IS ABLE TO CAPTURE MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND FRAMES PER SECOND LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE
FabianOefner_2013G@249.16:252.83 THANK YOU VERY MUCH I AGREE IT LOOKS PRETTY AMAZING
FabianOefner_2013G@253.01:266.08 BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU A FUNNY STORY I GOT AN INDOOR SUNBURN DOING THIS WHILE SHOOTING IN LOS ANGELES NOW IN LOS ANGELES YOU COULD GET A DECENT SUNBURN JUST ON ANY OF THE BEACHES BUT I GOT MINE INDOORS
FabianOefner_2013G@273.6:290.18 LOTS OF LIGHTS SO WE HAD THIS SPEAKER SET UP AND WE HAD THE CAMERA FACING IT AND LOTS OF LIGHTS POINTING AT THE SPEAKER AND I WOULD SET UP THE SPEAKER PUT THE TINY LITTLE CRYSTALS ON TOP OF THAT SPEAKER AND WE WOULD DO THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN
FabianOefner_2013G@290.18:297.94 AND IT WAS UNTIL MIDDAY THAT I REALIZED THAT I HAD A COMPLETELY RED FACE BECAUSE OF THE LIGHTS POINTING AT THE SPEAKER
FabianOefner_2013G@310.82:316.16 LET ME NOW TURN TO ANOTHER PROJECT WHICH INVOLVES LESS HARMFUL SUBSTANCES
FabianOefner_2013G@319.5:322.98 HAS ANYONE OF YOU HEARD OF FERROFLUID
FabianOefner_2013G@343.03:354.67 SO IF I NOW PUT THIS LIQUID INTO A MAGNETIC FIELD IT WOULD CHANGE ITS APPEARANCE NOW I 'VE GOT A LIVE DEMONSTRATION OVER HERE TO SHOW THIS TO YOU
FabianOefner_2013G@359.58:365.34 SO I 'VE GOT A CAMERA POINTING DOWN AT THIS PLATE AND UNDERNEATH THAT PLATE THERE IS A MAGNET
FabianOefner_2013G@365.34:371.11 NOW I 'M GOING TO ADD SOME OF THAT FERROFLUID TO THAT MAGNET
FabianOefner_2013G@401.88:416.87 NOW THIS LOOKS ALREADY QUITE INTERESTING BUT LET ME NOW ADD SOME WATERCOLORS TO IT THOSE ARE JUST STANDARD WATERCOLORS THAT YOU WOULD PAINT WITH YOU WOULDN 'T PAINT WITH SYRINGES BUT IT WORKS JUST THE SAME
FabianOefner_2013G@431.02:436.05 SO WHAT HAPPENED NOW IS WHEN THE WATERCOLOR WAS FLOWING INTO THE STRUCTURE
FabianOefner_2013G@436.05:441.93 THE WATERCOLORS DO NOT MIX WITH THE FERROFLUID THAT 'S BECAUSE THE FERROFLUID ITSELF
FabianOefner_2013G@441.93:446.05 IS HYDROPHOBIC THAT MEANS IT DOESN 'T MIX WITH THE WATER
FabianOefner_2013G@446.05:465.26 AND AT THE SAME TIME IT TRIES TO MAINTAIN ITS POSITION ABOVE THE MAGNET AND THEREFORE IT CREATES THOSE AMAZING LOOKING STRUCTURES OF CHANNELS AND TINY LITTLE PONDS OF COLORFUL WATER PAINT SO THAT WAS THE SECOND PROJECT LET ME NOW TURN TO THE LAST PROJECT WHICH INVOLVES
FabianOefner_2013G@465.26:468.37 THE
FabianOefner_2013G@468.37:471.36 THE NATIONAL BEVERAGE OF SCOTLAND
FabianOefner_2013G@490.59:495.95 I CAN ASSURE YOU I WAS FULLY CONSCIOUS WHILE I WAS TAKING THOSE PICTURES
FabianOefner_2013G@495.95:515.38 NOW WHISKEY CONTAINS FORTY PERCENT OF ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOL HAS GOT SOME VERY INTERESTING PROPERTIES MAYBE YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME OF THOSE PROPERTIES BEFORE BUT I AM TALKING ABOUT THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES NOT THE OTHER ONES SO WHEN I OPEN THE BOTTLE
FabianOefner_2013G@534.29:537.53 LET ME DEMONSTRATE THIS OVER HERE
FabianOefner_2013G@544.17:554.85 AND WHAT I HAVE HERE IS AN EMPTY GLASS VESSEL IT 'S GOT NOTHING IN IT AND NOW I 'M GOING TO FILL IT WITH OXYGEN AND WHISKEY
FabianOefner_2013G@578.06:586.29 NOW WE JUST WAIT FOR A FEW SECONDS FOR THE MOLECULES TO SPREAD INSIDE THE BOTTLE AND NOW LET 'S SET THAT ON FIRE
FabianOefner_2013G@603.58:617.9 SO THAT 'S ALL THAT HAPPENS IT GOES REALLY FAST AND IT 'S NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE I COULD DO IT AGAIN TO SHOW IT ONE MORE TIME BUT SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF THE WHISKEY AND THAT I SHOULD RATHER DRINK IT
FabianOefner_2013G@633.2:647.82 SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THE FLAME TRAVELED THROUGH THE GLASS VESSEL FROM TOP TO BOTTOM BURNING THE MIX OF THE AIR MOLECULES AND THE ALCOHOL SO THE IMAGES THAT YOU SAW AT THE BEGINNING
FabianOefner_2013G@647.82:662.06 THEY ARE ACTUALLY A FLAME STOPPED IN TIME WHILE IT IS TRAVELING THROUGH THE BOTTLE AND YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE IT WAS FLIPPED AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES SO THAT 'S HOW THOSE IMAGES WERE MADE
FabianOefner_2013G@669.2:681.29 SO I HAVE NOW SHOWED YOU THREE PROJECTS AND YOU MIGHT ASK YOURSELF WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR WHAT 'S THE IDEA BEHIND IT IS IT JUST A WASTE OF WHISKEY IS IT JUST SOME STRANGE MATERIALS
FabianOefner_2013G@681.29:693.21 THOSE THREE PROJECTS THEY 'RE BASED ON VERY SIMPLE SCIENTIFIC PHENOMENA SUCH AS MAGNETISM THE SOUND WAVES OR OVER HERE THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF A SUBSTANCE
FabianOefner_2013G@693.21:710.54 AND WHAT I 'M TRYING TO DO IS I 'M TRYING TO USE THESE PHENOMENA AND SHOW THEM IN A POETIC AND UNSEEN WAY AND THEREFORE INVITE THE VIEWER TO PAUSE FOR A MOMENT AND THINK ABOUT ALL THE BEAUTY THAT IS CONSTANTLY SURROUNDING US
FabianOefner_2013G@710.54:713.9 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
