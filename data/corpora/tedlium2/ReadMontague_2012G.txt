ReadMontague_2012G@16.27:29.73 EVERYONE IS INTERESTED IN OTHER PEOPLE EVERYONE HAS RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY 'RE INTERESTED IN THESE RELATIONSHIPS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS GOOD RELATIONSHIPS BAD RELATIONSHIPS ANNOYING RELATIONSHIPS AGNOSTIC RELATIONSHIPS
ReadMontague_2012G@29.73:40.5 AND WHAT I 'M GOING TO DO IS FOCUS ON THE CENTRAL PIECE OF AN INTERACTION THAT GOES ON IN A RELATIONSHIP SO I 'M GOING TO TAKE AS INSPIRATION THE FACT THAT WE 'RE ALL INTERESTED IN INTERACTING WITH OTHER PEOPLE
ReadMontague_2012G@40.5:46.25 I 'M GOING TO COMPLETELY STRIP IT OF ALL ITS COMPLICATING FEATURES AND I 'M GOING TO TURN THAT
ReadMontague_2012G@46.25:59 OBJECT THAT SIMPLIFIED OBJECT INTO A SCIENTIFIC PROBE AND PROVIDE THE EARLY STAGES EMBRYONIC STAGES OF NEW INSIGHTS INTO WHAT HAPPENS IN TWO BRAINS WHILE THEY SIMULTANEOUSLY INTERACT
ReadMontague_2012G@62.7:82.61 THE FIRST IS WE CAN NOW EAVESDROP SAFELY ON HEALTHY BRAIN ACTIVITY WITHOUT NEEDLES AND RADIOACTIVITY WITHOUT ANY KIND OF CLINICAL REASON WE CAN GO DOWN THE STREET AND RECORD FROM YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS BRAINS WHILE THEY DO A VARIETY OF COGNITIVE TASKS AND WE USE A METHOD CALLED FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
ReadMontague_2012G@82.61:99.76 YOU 'VE PROBABLY ALL READ ABOUT IT OR HEARD ABOUT IN SOME INCARNATION LET ME GIVE YOU A TWO SENTENCE VERSION OF IT SO WE 'VE ALL HEARD OF MRIS MRIS USE MAGNETIC FIELDS AND RADIO WAVES AND THEY TAKE SNAPSHOTS OF YOUR BRAIN OR YOUR KNEE OR YOUR STOMACH GRAYSCALE IMAGES THAT ARE FROZEN IN TIME
ReadMontague_2012G@99.76:110.48 IN THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY S IT WAS DISCOVERED YOU COULD USE THE SAME MACHINES IN A DIFFERENT MODE AND IN THAT MODE YOU COULD MAKE MICROSCOPIC BLOOD FLOW MOVIES FROM HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SITES INDEPENDENTLY IN THE BRAIN
ReadMontague_2012G@121.64:137.15 YOU MAKE A BLOOD FLOW MOVIE YOU HAVE AN INDEPENDENT PROXY OF BRAIN ACTIVITY THIS HAS LITERALLY REVOLUTIONIZED COGNITIVE SCIENCE TAKE ANY COGNITIVE DOMAIN YOU WANT MEMORY MOTOR PLANNING THINKING ABOUT YOUR MOTHER IN LAW GETTING ANGRY AT PEOPLE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE IT GOES ON AND ON
ReadMontague_2012G@137.15:151.21 PUT PEOPLE INTO FUNCTIONAL MRI DEVICES AND IMAGE HOW THESE KINDS OF VARIABLES MAP ONTO BRAIN ACTIVITY IT 'S IN ITS EARLY STAGES AND IT 'S CRUDE BY SOME MEASURES BUT IN FACT TWENTY YEARS AGO WE WERE AT NOTHING YOU COULDN 'T DO PEOPLE LIKE THIS YOU COULDN 'T DO HEALTHY PEOPLE
ReadMontague_2012G@151.21:158.68 THAT 'S CAUSED A LITERAL REVOLUTION AND IT 'S OPENED US UP TO A NEW EXPERIMENTAL PREPARATION NEUROBIOLOGISTS AS YOU WELL KNOW
ReadMontague_2012G@158.68:176.07 HAVE LOTS OF EXPERIMENTAL PREPS WORMS AND RODENTS AND FRUIT FLIES AND THINGS LIKE THIS AND NOW WE HAVE A NEW EXPERIMENTAL PREP HUMAN BEINGS WE CAN NOW USE HUMAN BEINGS TO STUDY AND MODEL THE SOFTWARE IN HUMAN BEINGS AND WE HAVE A FEW BURGEONING BIOLOGICAL MEASURES
ReadMontague_2012G@223.27:233.34 I WON 'T GO THROUGH THE DETAILS OF IT BUT THAT 'S AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY AND WE KNOW A GOOD BIT ABOUT THAT NOW AND IT 'S JUST A SMALL PIECE OF IT BUT IT 'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE NEURONS THAT YOU WOULD LOSE IF YOU HAD PARKINSON 'S DISEASE
ReadMontague_2012G@233.34:246.48 AND THEY 'RE ALSO THE NEURONS THAT ARE HIJACKED BY LITERALLY EVERY DRUG OF ABUSE AND THAT MAKES SENSE DRUGS OF ABUSE WOULD COME IN AND THEY WOULD CHANGE THE WAY YOU VALUE THE WORLD THEY CHANGE THE WAY YOU VALUE THE SYMBOLS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR DRUG OF CHOICE AND THEY MAKE YOU VALUE THAT
ReadMontague_2012G@246.67:258.86 OVER EVERYTHING ELSE HERE 'S THE KEY FEATURE THOUGH THESE NEURONS ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN THE WAY YOU CAN ASSIGN VALUE TO LITERALLY ABSTRACT IDEAS AND I PUT SOME SYMBOLS UP HERE THAT WE ASSIGN VALUE TO FOR VARIOUS REASONS
ReadMontague_2012G@258.86:274.95 WE HAVE A BEHAVIORAL SUPERPOWER IN OUR BRAIN AND IT AT LEAST IN PART INVOLVES DOPAMINE WE CAN DENY EVERY INSTINCT WE HAVE FOR SURVIVAL FOR AN IDEA FOR A MERE IDEA NO OTHER SPECIES CAN DO THAT IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN THE CULT HEAVEN 'S GATE COMMITTED
ReadMontague_2012G@292.83:298.26 USING EXACTLY THE SAME SYSTEMS THAT WERE PUT THERE TO MAKE THEM SURVIVE THAT 'S A LOT OF CONTROL
ReadMontague_2012G@298.26:311.56 OKAY ONE THING THAT I 'VE LEFT OUT OF THIS NARRATIVE IS THE OBVIOUS THING WHICH IS THE FOCUS OF THE REST OF MY LITTLE TALK AND THAT IS OTHER PEOPLE THESE SAME VALUATION SYSTEMS ARE REDEPLOYED WHEN WE 'RE VALUING INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PEOPLE
ReadMontague_2012G@329.33:331.72 LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THIS
ReadMontague_2012G@331.72:337.66 YOU BRING TO THE TABLE SUCH ENORMOUS PROCESSING POWER IN THIS DOMAIN THAT YOU HARDLY EVEN NOTICE IT
ReadMontague_2012G@355.59:373.4 HERE 'S A COUPLE THEY 'RE SHARING A MOMENT TOGETHER AND WE 'VE EVEN DONE AN EXPERIMENT WHERE YOU CAN CUT OUT DIFFERENT PIECES OF THIS FRAME AND YOU CAN STILL SEE THAT THEY 'RE SHARING IT THEY 'RE SHARING IT SORT OF IN PARALLEL NOW THE ELEMENTS OF THE SCENE ALSO COMMUNICATE THIS TO US BUT YOU CAN READ IT STRAIGHT OFF THEIR FACES AND IF YOU COMPARE THEIR FACES TO NORMAL FACES IT WOULD BE A VERY SUBTLE CUE
ReadMontague_2012G@373.4:383.26 HERE 'S ANOTHER COUPLE HE 'S PROJECTING OUT AT US AND SHE 'S CLEARLY PROJECTING YOU KNOW LOVE AND ADMIRATION AT HIM HERE 'S ANOTHER COUPLE
ReadMontague_2012G@386.11:388.58 AND I 'M THINKING I 'M NOT SEEING LOVE AND ADMIRATION ON THE LEFT
ReadMontague_2012G@417.31:430.68 IT GIVES THEM THE PIE IT GIVES THAT KIND OF A BEHAVIORAL PUNCH WHICH WE 'VE CALLED A SUPERPOWER SO HOW CAN WE TAKE THAT AND ARRANGE A KIND OF STAGED SOCIAL INTERACTION AND TURN THAT INTO A SCIENTIFIC PROBE AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS GAMES
ReadMontague_2012G@430.68:449.19 ECONOMIC GAMES SO WHAT WE DO IS WE GO INTO TWO AREAS ONE AREA IS CALLED EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS THE OTHER AREA IS CALLED BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS AND WE STEAL THEIR GAMES AND WE CONTRIVE THEM TO OUR OWN PURPOSES SO THIS SHOWS YOU ONE PARTICULAR GAME CALLED AN ULTIMATUM GAME RED PERSON IS GIVEN A HUNDRED DOLLARS AND CAN OFFER A SPLIT TO BLUE
ReadMontague_2012G@449.19:455.65 LET 'S SAY RED WANTS TO KEEP SEVENTY AND OFFERS BLUE THIRTY SO HE OFFERS A SEVENTY THIRTY SPLIT WITH BLUE
ReadMontague_2012G@455.65:465.55 CONTROL PASSES TO BLUE AND BLUE SAYS I ACCEPT IT IN WHICH CASE HE 'D GET THE MONEY OR BLUE SAYS I REJECT IT IN WHICH CASE NO ONE GETS ANYTHING OKAY SO
ReadMontague_2012G@465.88:480.18 A RATIONAL CHOICE ECONOMIST WOULD SAY WELL YOU SHOULD TAKE ALL NON ZERO OFFERS WHAT DO PEOPLE DO PEOPLE ARE INDIFFERENT AT AN EIGHTY TWENTY SPLIT AT EIGHTY TWENTY IT 'S A COIN FLIP WHETHER YOU ACCEPT THAT OR NOT WHY IS THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU 'RE PISSED OFF
ReadMontague_2012G@480.18:491.01 YOU 'RE MAD THAT 'S AN UNFAIR OFFER AND YOU KNOW WHAT AN UNFAIR OFFER IS THIS IS THE KIND OF GAME DONE BY MY LAB AND MANY AROUND THE WORLD THAT JUST GIVES YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF THING THAT THESE GAMES PROBE
ReadMontague_2012G@491.01:507.12 THE INTERESTING THING IS THESE GAMES REQUIRE THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF COGNITIVE APPARATUS ON LINE YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO COME TO THE TABLE WITH A PROPER MODEL OF ANOTHER PERSON YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO REMEMBER WHAT YOU 'VE DONE YOU HAVE TO STAND UP IN THE MOMENT TO DO THAT THEN YOU HAVE TO UPDATE YOUR MODEL BASED ON THE SIGNALS COMING BACK
ReadMontague_2012G@520.43:530.24 YOU SIT ACROSS THE DESK FROM SOMEBODY THEY HAVE SOME PRIOR IMAGE OF YOU YOU SEND SIGNALS ACROSS THE DESK TO MOVE THEIR IMAGE OF YOU FROM ONE PLACE TO A PLACE WHERE YOU WANT IT TO BE
ReadMontague_2012G@549.53:557.37 WAS DIMINISHED THE BIRDS WOULD SWOON BEFORE PEOPLE WOULD SO IT ACTED AS AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM HEY GET OUT OF THE MINE THINGS AREN 'T GOING SO WELL
ReadMontague_2012G@557.37:576.79 PEOPLE COME TO THE TABLE AND EVEN THESE VERY BLUNT STAGED SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND THEY AND THERE 'S JUST NUMBERS GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND THEY BRING ENORMOUS SENSITIVITIES TO IT SO WE REALIZED WE COULD EXPLOIT THIS AND IN FACT AS WE 'VE DONE THAT AND WE 'VE DONE THIS NOW IN MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE I THINK ON THE ORDER OF
ReadMontague_2012G@576.79:585.05 FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND WE ACTUALLY TO MAKE THIS A BIOLOGICAL PROBE NEED BIGGER NUMBERS THAN THAT REMARKABLY SO BUT ANYWAY
ReadMontague_2012G@585.05:604.66 PATTERNS HAVE EMERGED AND WE 'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE THOSE PATTERNS CONVERT THEM INTO MATHEMATICAL MODELS AND USE THOSE MATHEMATICAL MODELS TO GAIN NEW INSIGHTS INTO THESE EXCHANGES OKAY SO WHAT WELL THE SO WHAT IS THAT 'S A REALLY NICE BEHAVIORAL MEASURE THE ECONOMIC GAMES BRING TO US NOTIONS OF OPTIMAL PLAY WE CAN COMPUTE THAT DURING THE GAME
ReadMontague_2012G@604.66:608.04 AND WE CAN USE THAT TO SORT OF CARVE UP THE BEHAVIOR
ReadMontague_2012G@608.04:616.71 HERE 'S THE COOL THING SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AGO WE DEVELOPED A TEAM IT WAS AT THE TIME IN HOUSTON TEXAS IT 'S NOW IN VIRGINIA AND LONDON
ReadMontague_2012G@616.71:632.34 AND WE BUILT SOFTWARE THAT 'LL LINK FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING DEVICES UP OVER THE INTERNET I GUESS WE 'VE DONE UP TO SIX MACHINES AT A TIME BUT LET 'S JUST FOCUS ON TWO SO IT SYNCHRONIZES MACHINES ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WE SYNCHRONIZE THE MACHINES
ReadMontague_2012G@632.34:649.36 SET THEM INTO THESE STAGED SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND WE EAVESDROP ON BOTH OF THE INTERACTING BRAINS SO FOR THE FIRST TIME WE DON 'T HAVE TO LOOK AT JUST AVERAGES OVER SINGLE INDIVIDUALS OR HAVE INDIVIDUALS PLAYING COMPUTERS OR TRY TO MAKE INFERENCES THAT WAY WE CAN STUDY INDIVIDUAL DYADS WE CAN STUDY THE WAY THAT ONE PERSON INTERACTS WITH ANOTHER PERSON
ReadMontague_2012G@649.36:654.41 TURN THE NUMBERS UP AND START TO GAIN NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE BOUNDARIES OF NORMAL COGNITION
ReadMontague_2012G@654.41:660.72 BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE CAN PUT PEOPLE WITH CLASSICALLY DEFINED MENTAL ILLNESSES OR BRAIN DAMAGE
ReadMontague_2012G@660.73:680.06 INTO THESE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND USE THESE AS PROBES OF THAT SO WE 'VE STARTED THIS EFFORT WE 'VE MADE A FEW HITS A FEW I THINK EMBRYONIC DISCOVERIES WE THINK THERE 'S A FUTURE TO THIS BUT IT 'S OUR WAY OF GOING IN AND REDEFINING WITH A NEW LEXICON A MATHEMATICAL ONE ACTUALLY AS OPPOSED TO THE STANDARD WAYS THAT WE THINK ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS
ReadMontague_2012G@684.68:704.62 THAT IS WE EXPLOIT THE FACT THAT THE HEALTHY PARTNER PLAYING SOMEBODY WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION OR PLAYING SOMEBODY WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER OR PLAYING SOMEBODY WITH ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER WE USE THAT AS A KIND OF BIOSENSOR AND THEN WE USE COMPUTER PROGRAMS TO MODEL THAT PERSON AND IT GIVES US A KIND OF ASSAY OF THIS
ReadMontague_2012G@704.62:724.13 EARLY DAYS AND WE 'RE JUST BEGINNING WE 'RE SETTING UP SITES AROUND THE WORLD HERE ARE A FEW OF OUR COLLABORATING SITES THE HUB IRONICALLY ENOUGH IS CENTERED IN LITTLE ROANOKE VIRGINIA THERE 'S ANOTHER HUB IN LONDON NOW AND THE REST ARE GETTING SET UP WE HOPE TO GIVE THE DATA AWAY AT SOME STAGE
ReadMontague_2012G@724.13:741.74 THAT 'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE ABOUT MAKING IT AVAILABLE TO THE REST OF THE WORLD BUT WE 'RE ALSO STUDYING JUST A SMALL PART OF WHAT MAKES US INTERESTING AS HUMAN BEINGS AND SO I WOULD INVITE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THIS TO ASK US FOR THE SOFTWARE OR EVEN FOR GUIDANCE ON HOW TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT LET ME LEAVE YOU WITH ONE THOUGHT IN CLOSING
ReadMontague_2012G@741.74:749.66 THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT STUDYING COGNITION HAS BEEN THAT WE 'VE BEEN LIMITED IN A WAY WE JUST HAVEN 'T HAD THE TOOLS TO LOOK AT
ReadMontague_2012G@749.67:752.22 INTERACTING BRAINS SIMULTANEOUSLY
ReadMontague_2012G@752.22:767.19 THE FACT IS THOUGH THAT EVEN WHEN WE 'RE ALONE WE 'RE A PROFOUNDLY SOCIAL CREATURE WE 'RE NOT A SOLITARY MIND BUILT OUT OF PROPERTIES THAT KEPT IT ALIVE IN THE WORLD INDEPENDENT OF OTHER PEOPLE IN FACT OUR MINDS
ReadMontague_2012G@782.04:793.15 SO THIS IS THE FIRST SORT OF STEP INTO USING THAT INSIGHT INTO WHAT MAKES US HUMAN BEINGS TURNING IT INTO A TOOL AND TRYING TO GAIN NEW INSIGHTS INTO MENTAL ILLNESS THANKS FOR HAVING ME
