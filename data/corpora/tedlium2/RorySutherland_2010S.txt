RorySutherland_2010S YOU WHO MAY REMEMBER ME FROM TEDGLOBAL REMEMBER ME ASKING A FEW QUESTIONS WHICH STILL PREOCCUPY ME ONE OF THEM WAS WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO SPEND SIX BILLION POUNDS SPEEDING UP THE EUROSTAR TRAIN WHEN FOR A ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THAT MONEY YOU COULD HAVE TOP SUPERMODELS MALE AND FEMALE
RorySutherland_2010S YOU MAY REMEMBER ME ASKING THE QUESTION AS WELL A VERY INTERESTING OBSERVATION THAT ACTUALLY THOSE STRANGE LITTLE SIGNS THAT ACTUALLY FLASH THIRTY FIVE AT YOU OCCASIONALLY ACCOMPANYING A LITTLE SMILEY FACE OR A FROWN ACCORDING TO WHETHER YOU'RE WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE SPEED LIMIT
RorySutherland_2010S ARE ACTUALLY MORE EFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING ROAD ACCIDENTS THAN SPEED CAMERAS WHICH COME WITH THE ACTUAL THREAT OF REAL PUNISHMENT
RorySutherland_2010S TO BE A STRANGE DISPROPORTIONALITY AT WORK I THINK IN MANY AREAS OF HUMAN PROBLEM SOLVING PARTICULARLY THOSE WHICH INVOLVE HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY
RorySutherland_2010S WHICH IS THE TENDENCY OF THE ORGANIZATION OR THE INSTITUTION IS TO DEPLOY AS MUCH FORCE AS POSSIBLE AS MUCH COMPULSION AS POSSIBLE
RorySutherland_2010S ACTUALLY THE TENDENCY OF THE PERSON IS TO BE ALMOST INFLUENCED IN ABSOLUTE REVERSE PROPORTION TO THE AMOUNT OF FORCE BEING APPLIED
RorySutherland_2010S NOW ALL OF YOU IN THIS ROOM IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER ARE PROBABLY CUSTOMERS OF ONE OR BOTH OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT MERGED JUST INTERESTED DID ANYBODY NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT AS A RESULT OF THIS
RorySutherland_2010S SO UNLESS YOU HAPPENED TO BE A SHAREHOLDER OF ONE OR THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS OR ONE OF THE DEALMAKERS OR LAWYERS INVOLVED IN THE NO DOUBT LUCRATIVE ACTIVITY YOU'RE ACTUALLY ENGAGING IN A HUGE PIECE OF ACTIVITY THAT MEANT ABSOLUTELY BUGGER ALL TO ANYBODY
RorySutherland_2010S BY CONTRAST YEARS OF MARKETING HAVE TAUGHT ME THAT IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT PEOPLE TO REMEMBER YOU AND TO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO THE MOST POTENT THINGS ARE ACTUALLY VERY VERY SMALL THIS IS FROM VIRGIN ATLANTIC UPPER CLASS IT'S THE CRUET SALT AND PEPPER SET
RorySutherland_2010S QUITE NICE IN ITSELF THEY'RE LITTLE SORT OF AIRPLANE THINGS WHAT'S REALLY REALLY SWEET IS EVERY SINGLE PERSON LOOKING AT THESE THINGS HAS EXACTLY THE SAME MISCHIEVOUS THOUGHT WHICH IS
RorySutherland_2010S I RECKON I CAN HEIST THESE HOWEVER YOU PICK THEM UP AND UNDERNEATH ACTUALLY ENGRAVED IN THE METAL ARE THE WORDS STOLEN FROM
RorySutherland_2010S NOW
RorySutherland_2010S MY GUESS IS THAT THE COST OF INSTALLING THIS IN THE LIFT IN THE LYDMAR HOTEL IN STOCKHOLM IS PROBABLY FIVE HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND POUNDS MAX
RorySutherland_2010S IT'S FRANKLY MORE MEMORABLE THAN ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF HOTELS WE'VE ALL STAYED AT THAT TELL YOU THAT YOUR ROOM HAS ACTUALLY BEEN RECENTLY RENOVATED
RorySutherland_2010S AT A COST OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ORDER TO MAKE IT RESEMBLE EVERY OTHER HOTEL ROOM YOU'VE EVER STAYED IN IN THE ENTIRE COURSE OF YOUR LIFE
RorySutherland_2010S NOW THESE ARE TRIVIAL MARKETING EXAMPLES I ACCEPT BUT I WAS AT A TED EVENT RECENTLY AND ESTHER DUFLO PROBABLY ONE OF THE LEADING EXPERTS IN EFFECTIVELY THE ERADICATION OF POVERTY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD ACTUALLY SPOKE
RorySutherland_2010S BY NOT ONLY MAKING IT A SOCIAL EVENT I THINK GOOD USE OF BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS IN THAT IF YOU TURN UP WITH SEVERAL OTHER MOTHERS TO HAVE YOUR CHILD INOCULATED
RorySutherland_2010S YOUR SENSE OF CONFIDENCE IS MUCH GREATER THAN IF YOU TURN UP ALONE BUT SECONDLY TO INCENTIVIZE THAT INOCULATION BY GIVING A KILO OF LENTILS TO EVERYBODY WHO PARTICIPATED
RorySutherland_2010S IT'S A TINY TINY THING IF YOU'RE A SENIOR PERSON AT UNESCO AND SOMEONE SAYS SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ERADICATE WORLD
RorySutherland_2010S REALLY CONFIDENT STANDING UP THERE SAYING I 'VE GOT IT CRACKED IT'S THE LENTILS
RorySutherland_2010S OUR OWN SENSE OF SELF AGGRANDIZEMENT FEELS THAT BIG IMPORTANT PROBLEMS NEED TO HAVE BIG IMPORTANT AND MOST OF ALL EXPENSIVE SOLUTIONS ATTACHED TO THEM
RorySutherland_2010S ONCE YOU HAVE A VERY VERY LARGE BUDGET YOU ACTUALLY LOOK FOR EXPENSIVE THINGS TO SPEND IT ON WHAT IS COMPLETELY LACKING IS A CLASS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE IMMENSE AMOUNTS OF POWER BUT NO MONEY AT ALL
RorySutherland_2010S THOSE PEOPLE I'D QUITE LIKE TO CREATE IN THE WORLD GOING FORWARD NOW HERE 'S ANOTHER THING THAT HAPPENS WHICH IS WHAT I CALL SOMETIMES TERMINAL FIVE SYNDROME WHICH IS THAT BIG EXPENSIVE THINGS GET BIG
RorySutherland_2010S HIGHLY INTELLIGENT ATTENTION AND THEY'RE GREAT AND TERMINAL FIVE IS ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT UNTIL YOU GET DOWN TO THE SMALL DETAIL THE USABILITY WHICH IS THE SIGNAGE
RorySutherland_2010S WHICH IS CATASTROPHIC YOU COME OUT OF ARRIVE AT THE AIRPORT AND YOU FOLLOW A BIG YELLOW SIGN THAT SAYS TRAINS AND IT'S IN FRONT OF YOU SO YOU WALK FOR ANOTHER HUNDRED YARDS
RorySutherland_2010S IT'S QUITE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE A LIFT WITH NO UP AND DOWN BUTTON IN IT IF IT ONLY SERVES TWO FLOORS IT ACTUALLY BLOODY TERRIFYING
RorySutherland_2010S WHEN THE DOOR CLOSES AND THERE'S NOTHING FOR YOU TO DO YOU'VE ACTUALLY JUST STEPPED INTO A HAMMER FILM
RorySutherland_2010S THESE QUESTIONS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD IS THE BIG STUFF ACTUALLY IS DONE MAGNIFICENTLY WELL BUT THE SMALL STUFF WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL THE USER INTERFACE
RorySutherland_2010S DONE SPECTACULARLY BADLY BUT ALSO THERE SEEMS TO BE A COMPLETE SORT OF GRIDLOCK IN TERMS OF SOLVING THESE SMALL SOLUTIONS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO CAN ACTUALLY SOLVE THEM
RorySutherland_2010S ACTUALLY ARE TOO POWERFUL AND TOO PREOCCUPIED WITH SOMETHING THEY THINK OF AS STRATEGY TO ACTUALLY SOLVE THEM I TRIED THIS EXERCISE RECENTLY TALKING ABOUT BANKING THEY SAID CAN WE DO AN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN WHAT CAN WE DO AND ENCOURAGE MORE ONLINE BANKING
RorySutherland_2010S IS YOUR BALANCE I'VE GOT FRIENDS WHO ACTUALLY NEVER USE THEIR OWN BANK CASH MACHINES BECAUSE THERE'S THE RISK THAT IT MIGHT DISPLAY THEIR BALANCE ON THE SCREEN WHY WOULD YOU WILLINGLY EXPOSE YOURSELF TO BAD NEWS
RorySutherland_2010S OKAY YOU SIMPLY WOULDN 'T I SAID IF YOU MAKE ACTUALLY TELL ME MY BALANCE IF YOU MAKE THAT AN OPTION RATHER THAN A DEFAULT YOU'LL FIND
RorySutherland_2010S PRETTY RICH BY THE STANDARDS OF THE WORLD AT LARGE NOW INTERESTING THAT NO SINGLE PERSON DOES THAT OR AT LEAST CAN ADMIT TO BEING SO ANAL AS TO DO IT
RorySutherland_2010S BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT SUGGESTION WAS THAT TO IMPLEMENT THAT SUGGESTION WOULDN'T COST TEN MILLION POUNDS IT WOULDN'T INVOLVE LARGE AMOUNTS OF EXPENDITURE IT WOULD ACTUALLY COST ABOUT FIFTY QUID
RorySutherland_2010S IF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONVINCE EVERYBODY THAT THE SUCCESS OF ANY ORGANIZATION IS ALMOST ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE DECISIONS MADE BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IT MAKES THE DISPARITY IN SALARIES
RorySutherland_2010S SLIGHTLY MORE JUSTIFIABLE THAN IF YOU ACTUALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT QUITE A LOT OF CREDIT FOR A COMPANY 'S SUCCESS MIGHT ACTUALLY LIE SOMEWHERE ELSE IN SMALL PIECES OF TACTICAL ACTIVITY
RorySutherland_2010S WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT EFFECTIVELY AND THE INVENTION OF THE SPREADSHEET HASN'T HELPED THIS LOTS OF THINGS HAVEN'T HELPED THIS BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT SUFFERS FROM A KIND OF PHYSICS ENVY
RorySutherland_2010S IT WANTS THE WORLD TO BE THE KIND OF PLACE WHERE THE INPUT AND THE CHANGE ARE PROPORTIONATE IT'S A KIND OF MECHANISTIC WORLD THAT WE'D ALL LOVE TO LIVE IN WHERE
RorySutherland_2010S VERY NICELY ON SPREADSHEETS EVERYTHING IS NUMERICALLY EXPRESSIBLE AND THE AMOUNT YOU SPEND ON SOMETHING IS PROPORTIONATE TO THE SCALE OF YOUR SUCCESS
RorySutherland_2010S THAT'S THE WORLD PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT IN TRUTH WE DO LIVE IN A WORLD THAT SCIENCE CAN UNDERSTAND UNFORTUNATELY THE SCIENCE IS PROBABLY CLOSER TO BEING CLIMATOLOGY
RorySutherland_2010S IN THAT IN MANY CASES VERY VERY SMALL CHANGES CAN HAVE DISPROPORTIONATELY HUGE EFFECTS AND EQUALLY VAST AREAS OF ACTIVITY ENORMOUS MERGERS CAN ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH ABSOLUTELY BUGGER ALL
RorySutherland_2010S BUT IT'S VERY VERY UNCOMFORTABLE FOR US TO ACTUALLY ACKNOWLEDGE WE'RE LIVING IN SUCH A WORLD BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS WE COULD JUST MAKE THINGS A LITTLE BIT BETTER FOR OURSELVES
RorySutherland_2010S IF WE LOOKED AT IT IN THIS VERY SIMPLE FOUR WAY APPROACH THAT IS ACTUALLY STRATEGY AND I'M NOT DENYING THAT STRATEGY HAS A ROLE
RorySutherland_2010S THERE ARE CASES WHERE YOU SPEND QUITE A LOT OF MONEY AND YOU ACCOMPLISH QUITE A LOT AND I'D BE WRONG TO DIS THAT COMPLETELY MOVING OVER WE COME OF COURSE TO
RorySutherland_2010S I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY INDECENT OF ACCENTURE TO DITCH TIGER WOODS IN SUCH A SORT OF HURRIED AND HASTY WAY I MEAN TIGER SURELY WAS ACTUALLY OBEYING THE ACCENTURE MODEL HE DEVELOPED AN INTERESTING OUTSOURCING MODEL FOR SEXUAL SERVICES
RorySutherland_2010S NO LONGER TIED TO A SINGLE MONOPOLY PROVIDER IN MANY CASES SOURCING THINGS LOCALLY AND OF COURSE THE ABILITY TO HAVE BETWEEN ONE AND THREE GIRLS DELIVERED AT ANY TIME LED FOR BETTER LOAD BALANCING
RorySutherland_2010S SO WHAT ACCENTURE SUDDENLY FOUND SO UNATTRACTIVE ABOUT THAT I'M NOT SURE THEN THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT DON'T COST MUCH AND ACHIEVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THAT'S CALLED TRIVIA
RorySutherland_2010S BUT THERE'S A FOURTH THING
RorySutherland_2010S BUT WHICH IF THEY DO WORK CAN HAVE A SUCCESS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF PROPORTION TO THEIR EXPENSE THEIR EFFORTS AND THE DISRUPTION THEY
RorySutherland_2010S SO THE FIRST THING I'D LIKE IS A COMPETITION TO ANYBODY WATCHING THIS AS A FILM IS TO COME UP WITH THE NAME FOR THAT STUFF ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT
RorySutherland_2010S AND THE SECOND THING I THINK IS THAT THE WORLD NEEDS TO HAVE PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF THAT THAT'S WHY I CALL FOR THE CHIEF DETAIL OFFICER EVERY CORPORATION SHOULD HAVE ONE AND EVERY GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE A MINISTRY OF DETAIL
RorySutherland_2010S THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE NO MONEY WHO HAVE NO EXTRAVAGANT BUDGET BUT WHO REALIZE THAT ACTUALLY YOU MIGHT ACHIEVE GREATER SUCCESS IN UPTAKE OF A
