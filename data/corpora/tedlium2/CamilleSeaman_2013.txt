CamilleSeaman_2013 AS A SHINNECOCK INDIAN I WAS RAISED TO KNOW THIS WE ARE A SMALL FISHING TRIBE SITUATED ON THE SOUTHEASTERN TIP OF LONG ISLAND NEAR THE TOWN OF SOUTHAMPTON IN NEW YORK
CamilleSeaman_2013 WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL
CamilleSeaman_2013 MY GRANDFATHER TOOK ME TO SIT OUTSIDE IN THE SUN ON A HOT SUMMER DAY
CamilleSeaman_2013 THERE WERE NO CLOUDS IN THE SKY
CamilleSeaman_2013 AND AFTER A WHILE I BEGAN TO PERSPIRE
CamilleSeaman_2013 AND HE POINTED UP TO THE SKY
CamilleSeaman_2013 THAT FEEDS THE PLANTS THAT FEEDS THE ANIMALS
CamilleSeaman_2013 IN MY CONTINUED EXPLORATION OF SUBJECTS IN NATURE THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO ILLUSTRATE THE INTERCONNECTION OF ALL LIFE
CamilleSeaman_2013 I STARTED STORM CHASING IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AFTER MY DAUGHTER SAID MOM YOU SHOULD DO THAT
CamilleSeaman_2013 AND SO THREE DAYS LATER DRIVING VERY FAST
CamilleSeaman_2013 I FOUND MYSELF STALKING A SINGLE TYPE OF GIANT CLOUD CALLED THE SUPER
CamilleSeaman_2013 CAPABLE OF PRODUCING GRAPEFRUIT SIZE HAIL
CamilleSeaman_2013 AND SPECTACULAR TORNADOES ALTHOUGH ONLY TWO PERCENT ACTUALLY DO
CamilleSeaman_2013 THESE CLOUDS CAN GROW SO BIG
CamilleSeaman_2013 AND REACH UP TO SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND FEET INTO THE ATMOSPHERE
CamilleSeaman_2013 THEY CAN GROW SO BIG BLOCKING ALL DAYLIGHT MAKING IT VERY DARK AND OMINOUS STANDING UNDER THEM
CamilleSeaman_2013 STORM CHASING IS A VERY TACTILE EXPERIENCE
CamilleSeaman_2013 THERE 'S A WARM MOIST WIND BLOWING AT YOUR BACK
CamilleSeaman_2013 AND THE SMELL OF THE EARTH THE WHEAT THE GRASS
CamilleSeaman_2013 THE CHARGED PARTICLES
CamilleSeaman_2013 AND THEN THERE ARE THE COLORS IN THE CLOUDS
CamilleSeaman_2013 I 'VE LEARNED TO RESPECT THE LIGHTNING
CamilleSeaman_2013 MY HAIR USED TO BE STRAIGHT
CamilleSeaman_2013 THE WAY THEY SWIRL AND SPIN AND UNDULATE WITH THEIR LAVA LAMP LIKE MAMMATUS CLOUDS
CamilleSeaman_2013 THEY BECOME LOVELY MONSTERS
CamilleSeaman_2013 WHEN I 'M PHOTOGRAPHING THEM I CANNOT HELP BUT REMEMBER MY GRANDFATHER 'S LESSON
CamilleSeaman_2013 AS I STAND UNDER THEM I SEE NOT JUST A CLOUD BUT UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO WITNESS IS THE SAME FORCES THE SAME PROCESS IN A SMALL SCALE VERSION THAT HELPED TO CREATE OUR GALAXY
CamilleSeaman_2013 OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
CamilleSeaman_2013 OUR SUN AND EVEN THIS VERY PLANET
CamilleSeaman_2013 ALL MY RELATIONS THANK YOU
