CamilleSeaman_2013@15.63:27.33 AS A SHINNECOCK INDIAN I WAS RAISED TO KNOW THIS WE ARE A SMALL FISHING TRIBE SITUATED ON THE SOUTHEASTERN TIP OF LONG ISLAND NEAR THE TOWN OF SOUTHAMPTON IN NEW YORK
CamilleSeaman_2013@27.65:30.27 WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL
CamilleSeaman_2013@30.54:35.34 MY GRANDFATHER TOOK ME TO SIT OUTSIDE IN THE SUN ON A HOT SUMMER DAY
CamilleSeaman_2013@35.34:38.02 THERE WERE NO CLOUDS IN THE SKY
CamilleSeaman_2013@39.07:41.95 AND AFTER A WHILE I BEGAN TO PERSPIRE
CamilleSeaman_2013@42.83:45.22 AND HE POINTED UP TO THE SKY
CamilleSeaman_2013@56.08:59.43 THAT FEEDS THE PLANTS THAT FEEDS THE ANIMALS
CamilleSeaman_2013@61.26:69.06 IN MY CONTINUED EXPLORATION OF SUBJECTS IN NATURE THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO ILLUSTRATE THE INTERCONNECTION OF ALL LIFE
CamilleSeaman_2013@69.19:75.13 I STARTED STORM CHASING IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AFTER MY DAUGHTER SAID MOM YOU SHOULD DO THAT
CamilleSeaman_2013@75.62:80.07 AND SO THREE DAYS LATER DRIVING VERY FAST
CamilleSeaman_2013@81.96:87.8 I FOUND MYSELF STALKING A SINGLE TYPE OF GIANT CLOUD CALLED THE SUPER
CamilleSeaman_2013@89.13:93.04 CAPABLE OF PRODUCING GRAPEFRUIT SIZE HAIL
CamilleSeaman_2013@93.37:99.26 AND SPECTACULAR TORNADOES ALTHOUGH ONLY TWO PERCENT ACTUALLY DO
CamilleSeaman_2013@101.82:104.48 THESE CLOUDS CAN GROW SO BIG
CamilleSeaman_2013@106.74:110.67 AND REACH UP TO SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND FEET INTO THE ATMOSPHERE
CamilleSeaman_2013@111.26:116.42 THEY CAN GROW SO BIG BLOCKING ALL DAYLIGHT MAKING IT VERY DARK AND OMINOUS STANDING UNDER THEM
CamilleSeaman_2013@118.69:121.88 STORM CHASING IS A VERY TACTILE EXPERIENCE
CamilleSeaman_2013@121.98:125.35 THERE 'S A WARM MOIST WIND BLOWING AT YOUR BACK
CamilleSeaman_2013@126.02:129.79 AND THE SMELL OF THE EARTH THE WHEAT THE GRASS
CamilleSeaman_2013@130.62:132.15 THE CHARGED PARTICLES
CamilleSeaman_2013@133.04:135.53 AND THEN THERE ARE THE COLORS IN THE CLOUDS
CamilleSeaman_2013@141.1:143.99 I 'VE LEARNED TO RESPECT THE LIGHTNING
CamilleSeaman_2013@144.44:146.48 MY HAIR USED TO BE STRAIGHT
CamilleSeaman_2013@156.36:162.7 THE WAY THEY SWIRL AND SPIN AND UNDULATE WITH THEIR LAVA LAMP LIKE MAMMATUS CLOUDS
CamilleSeaman_2013@163.12:165.35 THEY BECOME LOVELY MONSTERS
CamilleSeaman_2013@166.31:172.1 WHEN I 'M PHOTOGRAPHING THEM I CANNOT HELP BUT REMEMBER MY GRANDFATHER 'S LESSON
CamilleSeaman_2013@172.74:186.8 AS I STAND UNDER THEM I SEE NOT JUST A CLOUD BUT UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO WITNESS IS THE SAME FORCES THE SAME PROCESS IN A SMALL SCALE VERSION THAT HELPED TO CREATE OUR GALAXY
CamilleSeaman_2013@187.05:188.69 OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
CamilleSeaman_2013@189:192.24 OUR SUN AND EVEN THIS VERY PLANET
