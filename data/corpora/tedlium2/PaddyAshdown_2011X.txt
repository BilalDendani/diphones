PaddyAshdown_2011X@16.88:18.51 A POEM WRITTEN BY
PaddyAshdown_2011X@22.63:24.24 IN CHURCHILL 'S BRAIN
PaddyAshdown_2011X@24.32:30.34 IN THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY S AND THE POEM GOES ON THE IDLE HILL OF SUMMER
PaddyAshdown_2011X@30.39:41.16 LAZY WITH THE FLOW OF STREAMS HARK I HEAR A DISTANT DRUMMER DRUMMING LIKE A SOUND IN DREAMS FAR AND NEAR AND LOW AND LOUDER ON THE ROADS OF EARTH GO BY DEAR TO FRIEND
PaddyAshdown_2011X@71.6:76.48 AND THESE ARE ALWAYS PERIODS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ACCOMPANIED BY TURBULENCE
PaddyAshdown_2011X@83.21:95.3 TO LIVE AT JUST ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS IN HISTORY WHEN THE GIMBALS UPON WHICH THE ESTABLISHED ORDER OF POWER IS BEGINNING TO CHANGE AND THE NEW LOOK OF THE WORLD THE NEW POWERS THAT EXIST IN THE WORLD
PaddyAshdown_2011X@95.32:97.96 ARE BEGINNING TO TAKE FORM AND
PaddyAshdown_2011X@97.96:116.33 THESE ARE AND WE SEE IT VERY CLEARLY TODAY NEARLY ALWAYS HIGHLY TURBULENT TIMES HIGHLY DIFFICULT TIMES AND ALL TOO OFTEN VERY BLOODY TIMES BY THE WAY IT HAPPENS ABOUT ONCE EVERY CENTURY YOU MIGHT ARGUE THAT THE LAST TIME IT HAPPENED AND THAT 'S WHAT HOUSMAN FELT COMING AND WHAT CHURCHILL FELT TOO WAS THAT WHEN POWER PASSED FROM THE OLD
PaddyAshdown_2011X@116.33:124.97 NATIONS THE OLD POWERS OF EUROPE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC TO THE NEW EMERGING POWER OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THE BEGINNING OF THE AMERICAN CENTURY
PaddyAshdown_2011X@124.97:134.07 AND OF COURSE INTO THE VACUUM WHERE THE TOO OLD EUROPEAN POWERS USED TO BE WERE PLAYED THE TWO BLOODY CATASTROPHES OF THE LAST CENTURY
PaddyAshdown_2011X@156.06:171.38 AND THE SECOND IS ABOUT SOME NEW DIMENSION WHICH I WANT TO REFER TO WHICH HAS NEVER QUITE HAPPENED IN THE WAY IT 'S HAPPENING NOW BUT LET 'S TALK ABOUT THE SHIFTS OF POWER THAT ARE OCCURRING TO THE WORLD AND WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY IS IN ONE SENSE FRIGHTENING BECAUSE IT 'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE
PaddyAshdown_2011X@171.65:183.54 WE HAVE SEEN LATERAL SHIFTS OF POWER THE POWER OF GREECE PASSED TO ROME AND THE POWER SHIFTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE EUROPEAN CIVILIZATIONS BUT WE ARE SEEING SOMETHING SLIGHTLY
PaddyAshdown_2011X@195.52:208.93 WITHIN THE INSTITUTION OF THE NATION STATE HAS NOW MIGRATED IN VERY LARGE MEASURE ONTO THE GLOBAL STAGE THE GLOBALIZATION OF POWER WE TALK ABOUT THE GLOBALIZATION OF MARKETS BUT ACTUALLY IT 'S THE GLOBALIZATION OF REAL POWER
PaddyAshdown_2011X@215.55:218.31 ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE IT IS NOT
PaddyAshdown_2011X@218.75:237.17 THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE AND THE GLOBAL STAGE WHERE POWER NOW RESIDES THE POWER OF THE INTERNET THE POWER OF THE SATELLITE BROADCASTERS THE POWER OF THE MONEY CHANGERS THIS VAST MONEY GO ROUND THAT CIRCULATES NOW THIRTY TWO TIMES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY NECESSARY FOR THE TRADE IT 'S SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TO FINANCE
PaddyAshdown_2011X@237.17:250.85 THE MONEY CHANGERS IF YOU LIKE THE FINANCIAL SPECULATORS THAT HAVE BROUGHT US ALL TO OUR KNEES QUITE RECENTLY THE POWER OF THE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS NOW DEVELOPING BUDGETS OFTEN BIGGER THAN MEDIUM SIZED COUNTRIES
PaddyAshdown_2011X@262.77:265.43 UP TO A MOMENT IT 'S ALWAYS
PaddyAshdown_2011X@273.96:284.37 UNREGULATED SPACE SPACE NOT SUBJECT TO THE RULE OF LAW BECOMES POPULATED NOT JUST BY THE THINGS YOU WANTED INTERNATIONAL TRADE THE INTERNET ETC BUT ALSO BY THE THINGS YOU DON 'T WANT
PaddyAshdown_2011X@285.02:287.82 INTERNATIONAL CRIMINALITY INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM
PaddyAshdown_2011X@287.88:293.17 THE REVELATION OF NINE ELEVEN IS THAT EVEN IF YOU ARE THE MOST POWERFUL NATION ON EARTH
PaddyAshdown_2011X@326.33:330.17 SOONER OR LATER THE RULE OF HISTORY IS
PaddyAshdown_2011X@335.37:339.65 AND IF IT IS THEREFORE THE CASE AS I BELIEVE IT IS THAT ONE OF THE PHENOMENON OF OUR TIME
PaddyAshdown_2011X@339.87:344.24 IS THE GLOBALIZATION OF POWER THEN IT FOLLOWS THAT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME
PaddyAshdown_2011X@344.66:350.16 IS TO BRING GOVERNANCE TO THE GLOBAL SPACE AND I BELIEVE THAT THE DECADES AHEAD OF US NOW
PaddyAshdown_2011X@350.44:354.2 WILL BE TO A GREATER OR LESSER EXTENT TURBULENT
PaddyAshdown_2011X@354.78:357.57 THE MORE OR LESS WE ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT
PaddyAshdown_2011X@371.15:380.64 BY SPAWNING MORE U N INSTITUTIONS IF WE DIDN 'T HAVE THE U N WE 'D HAVE TO INVENT IT THE WORLD NEEDS AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM IT NEEDS A MEANS BY WHICH YOU CAN LEGITIMIZE INTERNATIONAL ACTION
PaddyAshdown_2011X@404.57:413.63 AND YET POWERFUL ENOUGH TO HOLD EVEN THE MOST POWERFUL THE UNITED STATES TO ACCOUNT IF NECESSARY KYOTO THE BEGINNINGS OF STRUGGLING TO CREATE A TREATY BASED ORGANIZATION
PaddyAshdown_2011X@423.32:436.85 AND THAT 'S WHAT THE G TWENTY IS A TREATY BASED INSTITUTION NOW THERE 'S A PROBLEM THERE AND WE 'LL COME BACK TO IT IN A MINUTE WHICH IS THAT IF YOU BRING THE MOST POWERFUL TOGETHER TO MAKE THE RULES IN TREATY BASED INSTITUTIONS TO FILL THAT GOVERNANCE SPACE
PaddyAshdown_2011X@438.02:440.91 THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE WEAK WHO ARE LEFT OUT
PaddyAshdown_2011X@441.32:444.39 AND THAT 'S A BIG PROBLEM AND WE 'LL RETURN TO IT IN JUST A SECOND
PaddyAshdown_2011X@444.73:458.45 SO THERE 'S MY FIRST MESSAGE THAT IF YOU ARE TO PASS THROUGH THESE TURBULENT TIMES MORE OR LESS TURBULENTLY THEN OUR SUCCESS IN DOING THAT WILL IN LARGE MEASURE DEPEND ON OUR CAPACITY TO BRING SENSIBLE
PaddyAshdown_2011X@458.45:460.28 GOVERNANCE TO THE GLOBAL SPACE
PaddyAshdown_2011X@462.92:469.9 MY SECOND POINT IS AND I KNOW I DON 'T HAVE TO TALK TO AN AUDIENCE LIKE THIS ABOUT SUCH A THING BUT
PaddyAshdown_2011X@470.67:487.88 POWER IS NOT JUST SHIFTING VERTICALLY IT 'S ALSO SHIFTING HORIZONTALLY YOU MIGHT ARGUE THAT THE STORY THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATIONS HAS BEEN CIVILIZATIONS GATHERED AROUND SEAS WITH THE FIRST ONES AROUND THE MEDITERRANEAN THE MORE RECENT ONES IN THE ASCENDENTS OF WESTERN POWER AROUND THE ATLANTIC
PaddyAshdown_2011X@488.26:501.32 WELL IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE 'RE NOW SEEING A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT OF POWER BROADLY SPEAKING AWAY FROM NATIONS GATHERED AROUND THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD TO THE NATIONS GATHERED AROUND THE PACIFIC RIM NOW THAT BEGINS WITH ECONOMIC POWER BUT THAT 'S THE WAY IT ALWAYS BEGINS
PaddyAshdown_2011X@501.32:509.52 YOU ALREADY BEGIN TO SEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF FOREIGN POLICIES THE AUGMENTATION OF MILITARY BUDGETS OCCURRING IN THE OTHER GROWING POWERS IN THE WORLD
PaddyAshdown_2011X@509.56:515.52 I THINK ACTUALLY THIS IS NOT SO MUCH A SHIFT FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST SOMETHING DIFFERENT IS HAPPENING
PaddyAshdown_2011X@516.12:521.87 MY GUESS IS FOR WHAT IT 'S WORTH IS THAT THE UNITED STATES WILL REMAIN THE MOST POWERFUL NATION ON EARTH
PaddyAshdown_2011X@521.93:528.04 FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS FIFTEEN BUT THE CONTEXT IN WHICH SHE HOLDS HER POWER
PaddyAshdown_2011X@540.3:544.31 FOR OR AGAINST HAS TO BE REFERENCED BY ITS POSITION TO WASHINGTON
PaddyAshdown_2011X@544.65:547.93 A WORLD BESTRODE BY A SINGLE COLOSSUS
PaddyAshdown_2011X@548.31:557.98 BUT THAT 'S NOT A USUAL CASE IN HISTORY IN FACT WHAT 'S NOW EMERGING IS THE MUCH MORE NORMAL CASE OF HISTORY YOU 'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THE EMERGENCE OF A MULTI POLAR WORLD
PaddyAshdown_2011X@557.98:577.86 UP UNTIL NOW THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN THE DOMINANT FEATURE OF OUR WORLD THEY WILL REMAIN THE MOST POWERFUL NATION BUT THEY WILL BE THE MOST POWERFUL NATION IN AN INCREASINGLY MULTI POLAR WORLD AND YOU BEGIN TO SEE THE ALTERNATIVE CENTERS OF POWER BUILDING UP IN CHINA OF COURSE THOUGH MY OWN GUESS IS THAT CHINA 'S ASCENT TO GREATNESS IS NOT SMOOTH IT
PaddyAshdown_2011X@586.4:588.32 YOU SEE INDIA YOU SEE BRAZIL
PaddyAshdown_2011X@588.61:595.47 YOU SEE INCREASINGLY THAT THE WORLD NOW LOOKS ACTUALLY FOR US EUROPEANS MUCH MORE LIKE
PaddyAshdown_2011X@625.54:627.87 BUT A MULTIPLE POLARITY OF POWER
PaddyAshdown_2011X@627.99:641.34 MEANS SHIFTING AND CHANGING ALLIANCES AND THAT 'S THE WORLD WE 'RE COMING INTO IN WHICH WE WILL INCREASINGLY SEE THAT OUR ALLIANCES ARE NOT FIXED CANNING THE GREAT BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY ONCE SAID BRITAIN HAS A COMMON INTEREST BUT NO COMMON ALLIES
PaddyAshdown_2011X@642.07:654.76 AND WE WILL SEE INCREASINGLY THAT EVEN WE IN THE WEST WILL REACH OUT HAVE TO REACH OUT BEYOND THE COZY CIRCLE OF THE ATLANTIC POWERS TO MAKE ALLIANCES WITH OTHERS IF WE WANT TO GET THINGS DONE IN THE WORLD NOTE
PaddyAshdown_2011X@654.86:674.54 THAT WHEN WE WENT INTO LIBYA IT WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE WEST TO DO IT ALONE WE HAD TO BRING OTHERS IN WE HAD TO BRING IN THIS CASE THE ARAB LEAGUE IN MY GUESS IS IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN ARE THE LAST TIMES WHEN THE WEST HAS TRIED TO DO IT THEMSELVES AND WE HAVEN 'T SUCCEEDED MY GUESS IS THAT WE 'RE REACHING THE BEGINNING OF THE END
PaddyAshdown_2011X@685.3:691.3 YOU KNOW UP UNTIL NOW IF THE WEST GOT ITS ACT TOGETHER IT COULD PROPOSE AND DISPOSE IN EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD
PaddyAshdown_2011X@692.57:698.28 BUT THAT 'S NO LONGER TRUE TAKE THE LAST FINANCIAL CRISIS AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR
PaddyAshdown_2011X@698.31:702.78 THE WEST GOT TOGETHER THE BRETTON WOODS INSTITUTION WORLD BANK INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
PaddyAshdown_2011X@714.92:719.9 WHICH IS PROBABLY EVEN MORE STARTLING I SUSPECT WE ARE NOW REACHING
PaddyAshdown_2011X@743.31:748.61 WHAT IS THE LARGEST NAVAL CONTINGENT TACKLING THE ISSUE OF SOMALI PIRATES
PaddyAshdown_2011X@749.03:754.68 THE CHINESE NAVAL CONTINGENT OF COURSE THEY ARE THEY ARE A MERCANTILIST NATION THEY WANT TO KEEP THE SEA LANES OPEN
PaddyAshdown_2011X@754.88:768.22 INCREASINGLY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO BUSINESS WITH PEOPLE WITH WHOM WE DO NOT SHARE VALUES BUT WITH WHOM FOR THE MOMENT WE SHARE COMMON INTERESTS IT 'S A WHOLE NEW DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT THE WORLD THAT IS NOW EMERGING
PaddyAshdown_2011X@768.22:772.57 AND HERE 'S THE THIRD FACTOR WHICH IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
PaddyAshdown_2011X@773.44:779.62 TODAY IN OUR MODERN WORLD BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET BECAUSE OF THE KINDS OF THINGS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE
PaddyAshdown_2011X@784.62:788.25 WE ARE NOW INTERDEPENDENT WE ARE NOW INTERLOCKED
PaddyAshdown_2011X@788.64:794.29 AS NATIONS AS INDIVIDUALS IN A WAY WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN THE CASE BEFORE NEVER BEEN THE CASE BEFORE
PaddyAshdown_2011X@804.74:810.34 YOU GET SWINE FLU IN MEXICO IT 'S A PROBLEM FOR CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT TWENTY FOUR HOURS LATER
PaddyAshdown_2011X@810.48:813.71 LEHMAN BROTHERS GOES DOWN THE WHOLE LOT COLLAPSES
PaddyAshdown_2011X@814.05:816.41 FIRES IN THE STEPPES OF RUSSIA
PaddyAshdown_2011X@829.9:832.97 NOT CONNECTED WITH OTHERS NOT WORKING WITH OTHERS
PaddyAshdown_2011X@833.05:835.37 IS NO LONGER A VIABLE
PaddyAshdown_2011X@835.37:840.33 PROPOSITION BECAUSE THE ACTIONS OF A NATION STATE ARE NEITHER CONFINED TO ITSELF
PaddyAshdown_2011X@840.66:856.44 NOR IS IT SUFFICIENT FOR THE NATION STATE ITSELF TO CONTROL ITS OWN TERRITORY BECAUSE THE EFFECTS OUTSIDE THE NATION STATE ARE NOW BEGINNING TO AFFECT WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE THEM I WAS A YOUNG SOLDIER IN THE LAST OF THE SMALL EMPIRE WARS OF BRITAIN
PaddyAshdown_2011X@856.67:875.4 AT THAT TIME THE DEFENSE OF MY COUNTRY WAS ABOUT ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY HOW STRONG WAS OUR ARMY HOW STRONG WAS OUR AIR FORCE HOW STRONG WAS OUR NAVY AND HOW STRONG WERE OUR ALLIES THAT WAS WHEN THE ENEMY WAS OUTSIDE THE WALLS NOW THE ENEMY IS INSIDE THE WALLS NOW IF I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE DEFENSE OF MY COUNTRY I HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE MINISTER OF HEALTH
PaddyAshdown_2011X@876.07:885.94 BECAUSE PANDEMIC DISEASE IS A THREAT TO MY SECURITY I HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE BECAUSE FOOD SECURITY IS A THREAT TO MY SECURITY I HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE MINISTER OF INDUSTRY
PaddyAshdown_2011X@886.48:896.15 BECAUSE THE FRAGILITY OF OUR HI TECH INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOW A POINT OF ATTACK FOR OUR ENEMIES AS WE SEE FROM CYBER WARFARE I HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS
PaddyAshdown_2011X@896.22:907.05 BECAUSE WHO HAS ENTERED MY COUNTRY WHO LIVES IN THAT TERRACED HOUSE IN THAT INNER CITY HAS A DIRECT EFFECT ON WHAT HAPPENS IN MY COUNTRY AS WE IN LONDON SAW IN THE SEVEN SEVEN BOMBINGS
PaddyAshdown_2011X@907.86:916.92 IT 'S NO LONGER THE CASE THAT THE SECURITY OF A COUNTRY IS SIMPLY A MATTER FOR ITS SOLDIERS AND ITS MINISTRY OF DEFENSE IT 'S ITS CAPACITY TO LOCK TOGETHER ITS INSTITUTIONS
PaddyAshdown_2011X@916.92:931.84 AND THIS TELLS YOU SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT IT TELLS YOU THAT IN FACT OUR GOVERNMENTS VERTICALLY CONSTRUCTED CONSTRUCTED ON THE ECONOMIC MODEL OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION VERTICAL HIERARCHY SPECIALIZATION OF TASKS COMMAND STRUCTURES
PaddyAshdown_2011X@931.84:945.14 HAVE GOT THE WRONG STRUCTURES COMPLETELY YOU IN BUSINESS KNOW THAT THE PARADIGM STRUCTURE OF OUR TIME LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IS THE NETWORK IT 'S YOUR CAPACITY TO NETWORK THAT MATTERS BOTH WITHIN YOUR GOVERNMENTS AND EXTERNALLY
PaddyAshdown_2011X@945.24:960.88 SO HERE IS ASHDOWN 'S THIRD LAW BY THE WAY DON 'T ASK ME ABOUT ASHDOWN 'S FIRST LAW AND SECOND LAW BECAUSE I HAVEN 'T INVENTED THOSE YET IT ALWAYS SOUNDS BETTER IF THERE 'S A THIRD LAW DOESN 'T IT ASHDOWN 'S THIRD LAW IS THAT IN THE MODERN AGE WHERE EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED TO EVERYTHING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO
PaddyAshdown_2011X@961.78:977.21 IS WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH OTHERS THE MOST IMPORTANT BIT ABOUT YOUR STRUCTURE WHETHER YOU 'RE A GOVERNMENT WHETHER YOU 'RE AN ARMY REGIMENT WHETHER YOU 'RE A BUSINESS IS YOUR DOCKING POINTS YOUR INTERCONNECTORS YOUR CAPACITY TO NETWORK WITH OTHERS YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IN INDUSTRY GOVERNMENTS DON 'T
PaddyAshdown_2011X@997.59:1000.14 AS THE CONCEPT OF SECURING OUR NATIONS
PaddyAshdown_2011X@1004:1013.83 MORE POWERFUL THAN THEIR TRIBE I WAS SAFE IF MY COUNTRY WAS MORE POWERFUL THAN THEIR COUNTRY I WAS SAFE MY ALLIANCE LIKE NATO WAS MORE POWERFUL THAN THEIR ALLIANCE I WAS SAFE IT IS NO LONGER THE CASE
PaddyAshdown_2011X@1013.83:1022.53 THE ADVENT OF THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS AND OF THE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION MEANS THAT INCREASINGLY I SHARE A DESTINY WITH MY ENEMY
PaddyAshdown_2011X@1054.12:1065.73 AND SO SUDDENLY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHAT HAS BEEN THE PROPOSITION OF VISIONARIES AND POETS DOWN THE AGES BECOMES SOMETHING WE HAVE TO TAKE SERIOUSLY AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY
PaddyAshdown_2011X@1071.8:1074.3 SEND NOT FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS
PaddyAshdown_2011X@1075.72:1078.75 THE POEM IS CALLED NO MAN IS AN ISLAND AND IT GOES
PaddyAshdown_2011X@1085.16:1086.8 SEND NOT TO ASK
PaddyAshdown_2011X@1087.05:1088.64 FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS
PaddyAshdown_2011X@1094.65:1098.72 FOR US I THINK PART OF THE EQUATION FOR OUR SURVIVAL
