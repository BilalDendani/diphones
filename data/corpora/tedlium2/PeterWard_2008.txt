PeterWard_2008 THIS BEAUTIFUL PICTURE FROM MY CHILDHOOD I LOVE THE SCIENCE FICTION MOVIES HERE IT IS THIS ISLAND EARTH AND LEAVE IT TO HOLLYWOOD TO GET IT JUST RIGHT TWO AND A HALF YEARS IN THE MAKING
PeterWard_2008 THE CREATIONISTS GIVE US SIX THOUSAND BUT HOLLYWOOD GOES TO THE CHASE AND IN THIS MOVIE WE SEE WHAT WE THINK IS OUT THERE
PeterWard_2008 FLYING SAUCERS AND ALIENS EVERY WORLD HAS AN ALIEN AND EVERY ALIEN WORLD HAS A FLYING SAUCER AND THEY MOVE ABOUT WITH GREAT SPEED ALIENS
PeterWard_2008 WELL DON BROWNLEE MY FRIEND AND I FINALLY GOT TO THE POINT WHERE WE GOT TIRED OF TURNING ON THE TV AND SEEING THE SPACESHIPS AND SEEING THE ALIENS EVERY NIGHT
PeterWard_2008 AND TRIED TO WRITE A COUNTER ARGUMENT TO IT AND PUT OUT WHAT DOES IT REALLY TAKE FOR AN EARTH TO BE HABITABLE FOR A PLANET TO BE AN EARTH TO HAVE A PLACE WHERE YOU COULD PROBABLY GET NOT JUST LIFE
PeterWard_2008 BUT COMPLEXITY WHICH REQUIRES A HUGE AMOUNT OF EVOLUTION AND THEREFORE CONSTANCY OF CONDITIONS SO IN TWO THOUSAND WE WROTE RARE EARTH IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE WE THEN ASKED LET 'S NOT THINK ABOUT WHERE EARTHS ARE IN SPACE BUT HOW LONG HAS EARTH BEEN EARTH
PeterWard_2008 IF YOU GO BACK TWO BILLION YEARS YOU'RE NOT ON AN EARTH LIKE PLANET ANY MORE WHAT WE CALL AN EARTH LIKE PLANET IS ACTUALLY A VERY SHORT INTERVAL OF TIME
PeterWard_2008 RARE EARTH ACTUALLY TAUGHT ME AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT MEETING THE PUBLIC RIGHT AFTER I GOT AN INVITATION TO GO TO A SCIENCE FICTION CONVENTION
PeterWard_2008 AND WITH ALL GREAT EARNESTNESS WALKED IN DAVID BRIN WAS GOING TO DEBATE ME ON THIS AND AS I WALKED IN THE CROWD OF A HUNDRED STARTED BOOING LUSTILY I HAD A GIRL WHO CAME UP WHO SAID MY DAD SAYS YOU'RE THE DEVIL
PeterWard_2008 YOU CANNOT TAKE PEOPLE 'S ALIENS AWAY FROM THEM AND EXPECT TO BE ANYBODY 'S FRIENDS
PeterWard_2008 WELL THE SECOND PART OF THAT SOON AFTER AND I WAS TALKING TO PAUL ALLEN I SAW HIM IN THE AUDIENCE AND I HANDED HIM A COPY OF RARE EARTH AND JILL TARTER WAS THERE
PeterWard_2008 AND SHE TURNED TO ME AND SHE LOOKED AT ME JUST LIKE THAT GIRL IN THE EXORCIST IT WAS IT BURNS IT BURNS BECAUSE SETI DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR THIS
PeterWard_2008 STUFF OUT THERE I REALLY APPLAUD THE SETI EFFORTS BUT WE HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING YET AND I REALLY DO THINK WE HAVE TO START THINKING ABOUT
PeterWard_2008 WHAT'S A GOOD PLANET AND WHAT ISN 'T NOW I THROW THIS SLIDE UP BECAUSE IT INDICATES TO ME THAT EVEN IF SETI DOES HEAR SOMETHING
PeterWard_2008 CAN WE FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY SAID BECAUSE THIS WAS A SLIDE THAT WAS PASSED BETWEEN THE TWO MAJOR INTELLIGENCES ON EARTH A MAC TO A PC AND IT CAN'T EVEN GET THE LETTERS RIGHT
PeterWard_2008 SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO TALK TO THE ALIENS AND IF THEY'RE FIFTY LIGHT YEARS AWAY AND WE CALL THEM UP AND YOU BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH AND THEN FIFTY YEARS LATER IT COMES BACK AND THEY SAY PLEASE REPEAT
PeterWard_2008 THERE WE ARE OUR PLANET IS A GOOD PLANET BECAUSE IT CAN KEEP WATER MARS IS A BAD PLANET BUT IT'S STILL GOOD ENOUGH FOR US TO GO THERE AND TO LIVE ON ITS SURFACE IF WE'RE PROTECTED
PeterWard_2008 IS A VERY BAD THE WORST PLANET EVEN THOUGH IT'S EARTH LIKE AND EVEN THOUGH EARLY IN ITS HISTORY IT MAY VERY WELL HAVE HARBORED EARTH LIKE LIFE
PeterWard_2008 TO RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE THAT'S AN EIGHT HUNDRED DEGREES CENTIGRADE SURFACE BECAUSE OF RAMPANT CARBON DIOXIDE
PeterWard_2008 WE KNOW FROM ASTROBIOLOGY THAT WE CAN REALLY NOW PREDICT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO OUR PARTICULAR PLANET WE ARE RIGHT NOW IN THE BEAUTIFUL OREO OF EXISTENCE OF AT LEAST LIFE ON PLANET EARTH
PeterWard_2008 FOLLOWING THE FIRST HORRIBLE MICROBIAL AGE IN THE CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION LIFE EMERGED FROM THE SWAMPS COMPLEXITY AROSE AND FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH
PeterWard_2008 WE HAVE AS MUCH TIME FOR ANIMALS TO EXIST ON THIS PLANET
PeterWard_2008 AS THEY HAVE BEEN HERE NOW TILL WE HIT THE SECOND MICROBIAL AGE AND THAT WILL HAPPEN PARADOXICALLY EVERYTHING YOU HEAR ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING
PeterWard_2008 WHEN WE HIT CO TWO DOWN TO TEN PARTS PER MILLION WE ARE NO LONGER GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE PLANTS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND THERE GO ANIMALS
PeterWard_2008 SO AFTER THAT WE PROBABLY HAVE SEVEN BILLION YEARS THE SUN INCREASES IN ITS INTENSITY IN ITS BRIGHTNESS AND FINALLY
PeterWard_2008 AT ABOUT TWELVE BILLION YEARS AFTER IT FIRST STARTED THE EARTH IS CONSUMED BY A LARGE SUN AND THIS IS WHAT'S LEFT
PeterWard_2008 SO A PLANET LIKE US IS GOING TO HAVE AN AGE AND AN OLD AGE AND WE ARE IN ITS GOLDEN SUMMER AGE RIGHT NOW
PeterWard_2008 BUT THERE'S TWO FATES TO EVERYTHING ISN'T THERE NOW A LOT OF YOU ARE GOING TO DIE OF OLD AGE BUT SOME OF YOU HORRIBLY ENOUGH ARE GOING TO DIE IN AN ACCIDENT AND THAT'S THE FATE OF A PLANET TOO EARTH IF WE'RE LUCKY ENOUGH IF IT DOESN'T GET HIT BY A HALE BOPP
PeterWard_2008 OR GETS BLASTED BY SOME SUPERNOVA NEARBY IN THE NEXT SEVEN BILLION YEARS WE'LL FIND UNDER YOUR FEET BUT WHAT ABOUT ACCIDENTAL DEATH
PeterWard_2008 VERY SOON AFTER THE FOSSIL RECORD STARTED YIELDING A VERY GOOD IDEA OF HOW MANY PLANTS AND ANIMALS THERE HAVE BEEN SINCE COMPLEX LIFE REALLY BEGAN TO LEAVE A VERY INTERESTING FOSSIL RECORD
PeterWard_2008 IN THAT COMPLEX RECORD OF FOSSILS THERE WERE TIMES WHEN LOTS OF STUFF SEEMED TO BE DYING OUT VERY QUICKLY AND THE FATHER MOTHER GEOLOGISTS CALLED THESE MASS EXTINCTIONS
PeterWard_2008 WHERE WALTER ALVAREZ TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS THE TIME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE WHITE ROCKS WHICH HELD CREATURES OF THE CRETACEOUS PERIOD AND THE PINK ROCKS ABOVE WHICH HELD TERTIARY FOSSILS HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO GO FROM
PeterWard_2008 ONE SYSTEM TO THE NEXT AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS SOMETHING UNEXPECTED THEY FOUND IN THIS GAP IN BETWEEN A VERY THIN CLAY LAYER AND THAT CLAY LAYER THIS VERY THIN RED LAYER HERE
PeterWard_2008 IS FILLED WITH IRIDIUM AND NOT JUST IRIDIUM IT'S FILLED WITH GLASSY SPHERULES AND IT'S FILLED WITH QUARTZ GRAINS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO ENORMOUS PRESSURE SHOCK QUARTZ
PeterWard_2008 NOW IN THIS SLIDE THE WHITE IS CHALK AND THIS CHALK WAS DEPOSITED IN A WARM OCEAN THE CHALK ITSELF 'S COMPOSED BY PLANKTON WHICH HAS FALLEN DOWN FROM THE SEA SURFACE ONTO THE SEA FLOOR
PeterWard_2008 SO THAT NINETY PERCENT OF THE SEDIMENT HERE IS SKELETON OF LIVING STUFF AND THEN YOU HAVE THAT MILLIMETER THICK RED LAYER AND THEN YOU HAVE BLACK ROCK AND THE BLACK ROCK IS THE SEDIMENT ON THE SEA BOTTOM
PeterWard_2008 IN THE ABSENCE OF PLANKTON AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN AN ASTEROID CATASTROPHE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS WAS OF COURSE THIS IS THE FAMOUS K T A TEN KILOMETER BODY HIT THE PLANET
PeterWard_2008 THE EFFECTS OF IT SPREAD THIS VERY THIN IMPACT LAYER ALL OVER THE PLANET AND WE HAD VERY QUICKLY THE DEATH OF THE DINOSAURS
PeterWard_2008 PRIOR TO THAT UNIFORMITARIANISM WAS THE DOMINANT PARADIGM THE FACT THAT IF ANYTHING HAPPENS ON THE PLANET IN THE PAST THERE ARE PRESENT DAY PROCESSES THAT WILL EXPLAIN IT
PeterWard_2008 BUT WE HAVEN'T WITNESSED A BIG ASTEROID IMPACT SO THIS IS A TYPE OF NEO CATASTROPHISM AND IT TOOK ABOUT TWENTY YEARS FOR THE SCIENTIFIC ESTABLISHMENT TO FINALLY COME TO GRIPS YES WE WERE HIT AND YES THE EFFECTS OF THAT HIT CAUSED A MAJOR MASS EXTINCTION
PeterWard_2008 WAS THE P OR THE PERMIAN EXTINCTION SOMETIMES CALLED THE MOTHER OF ALL MASS EXTINCTIONS AND EVERY ONE OF THESE HAS BEEN SUBSEQUENTLY BLAMED ON LARGE BODY IMPACT
PeterWard_2008 IS THIS TRUE
PeterWard_2008 THE MOST RECENT THE PERMIAN WAS THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN AN IMPACT BECAUSE OF THIS BEAUTIFUL STRUCTURE ON THE RIGHT THIS IS A BUCKMINSTERFULLERENE A CARBON SIXTY BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE TERRIBLE GEODESIC DOMES OF MY LATE BELOVED SIXTIES THEY'RE CALLED BUCKYBALLS
PeterWard_2008 THE PRESSURE PRODUCES THE BUCKYBALLS AND IT CAPTURES BITS OF THE COMET HELIUM THREE VERY RARE ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH VERY COMMON IN SPACE
PeterWard_2008 SO LUCKY TO WATCH THE CHANGE OF THAT SOUTH AFRICA INTO THE NEW SOUTH AFRICA AS I WENT YEAR BY YEAR AND I WORKED ON THIS PERMIAN EXTINCTION CAMPING BY THIS BOER GRAVEYARD FOR MONTHS AT A TIME
PeterWard_2008 AND THE FOSSILS ARE EXTRAORDINARY YOU KNOW YOU'RE GAZING UPON YOUR VERY DISTANT ANCESTORS THESE ARE MAMMAL LIKE REPTILES THEY ARE CULTURALLY INVISIBLE WE DO NOT MAKE MOVIES ABOUT THESE THIS IS A GORGONOPSIAN OR A GORGON
PeterWard_2008 THAT'S AN EIGHTEEN INCH LONG SKULL OF AN ANIMAL THAT WAS PROBABLY SEVEN OR EIGHT FEET SPRAWLED LIKE A LIZARD PROBABLY HAD A HEAD LIKE A LION THIS IS THE TOP CARNIVORE THE T REX OF ITS TIME
PeterWard_2008 HOLD STILL YOU'RE THE SCALE
PeterWard_2008 THIS THRINAXODON THE SIZE OF A ROBIN EGG HERE THIS IS A SKULL I'VE DISCOVERED JUST BEFORE TAKING THIS PICTURE THERE'S A PEN FOR SCALE IT'S REALLY TINY THIS IS IN THE LOWER TRIASSIC AFTER THE MASS EXTINCTION HAS FINISHED
PeterWard_2008 YOU CAN SEE THE EYE SOCKET AND YOU CAN SEE THE LITTLE TEETH IN THE FRONT IF THAT DOES NOT SURVIVE I'M NOT THE THING GIVING THIS TALK
PeterWard_2008 SOMETHING ELSE IS BECAUSE IF THAT DOESN'T SURVIVE WE ARE NOT HERE THERE ARE NO MAMMALS IT'S THAT CLOSE ONE SPECIES EKES THROUGH
PeterWard_2008 WE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE PATTERN OF WHO SURVIVES AND WHO DOESN 'T HERE 'S SORT OF THE END OF THAT TEN YEARS OF WORK THE RANGES OF STUFF THE RED LINE IS THE MASS EXTINCTION
PeterWard_2008 THE SURVIVORS THAT DO GET THROUGH PRODUCE THIS WORLD OF CROCODILE LIKE CREATURES THERE'S NO DINOSAURS YET JUST THIS SLOW SAURIAN SCALY NASTY SWAMPY
PeterWard_2008 SO IF NOT IMPACT WHAT AND THE WHAT I THINK IS THAT WE RETURNED OVER AND OVER AGAIN
PeterWard_2008 TO THE PRE CAMBRIAN WORLD THAT FIRST MICROBIAL AGE AND THE MICROBES ARE STILL OUT THERE THEY HATE WE ANIMALS THEY REALLY WANT THEIR WORLD BACK AND THEY'VE TRIED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
PeterWard_2008 BEEN ON A FREEWAY ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON IN LOS ANGELES BELIEVING IN THE GAIA THEORY NO SO I REALLY SUSPECT THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE AND THAT LIFE DOES
PeterWard_2008 THERE ARE MICROBES WHICH THROUGH THEIR METABOLISM PRODUCE HYDROGEN SULFIDE AND THEY DO SO IN LARGE AMOUNTS HYDROGEN SULFIDE IS VERY FATAL TO WE HUMANS AS SMALL AS TWO HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION WILL KILL YOU
PeterWard_2008 HAVE TO GO TO THE BLACK SEA AND A FEW OTHER PLACES SOME LAKES AND GET DOWN AND YOU'LL FIND THAT THE WATER ITSELF TURNS PURPLE IT TURNS PURPLE FROM THE PRESENCE OF NUMEROUS MICROBES WHICH HAVE TO HAVE SUNLIGHT AND HAVE TO HAVE HYDROGEN SULFIDE
PeterWard_2008 AND WE CAN DETECT THEIR PRESENCE TODAY WE CAN SEE THEM BUT WE CAN ALSO DETECT THEIR PRESENCE IN THE PAST AND THE LAST THREE YEARS HAVE SEEN AN ENORMOUS BREAKTHROUGH IN A BRAND NEW FIELD
PeterWard_2008 I AM ALMOST EXTINCT I'M A PALEONTOLOGIST WHO COLLECTS FOSSILS BUT THE NEW WAVE OF PALAEONTOLOGISTS MY GRADUATE STUDENTS COLLECT BIOMARKERS
PeterWard_2008 THEY TAKE THE SEDIMENT ITSELF THEY EXTRACT THE OIL FROM IT AND FROM THAT THEY CAN PRODUCE COMPOUNDS WHICH TURN OUT TO BE VERY SPECIFIC TO PARTICULAR MICROBIAL GROUPS IT'S BECAUSE LIPIDS ARE SO TOUGH THEY CAN GET PRESERVED IN SEDIMENT
PeterWard_2008 AND LAST THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS NECESSARY AND BE EXTRACTED AND TELL US WHO WAS THERE AND WE KNOW WHO WAS THERE AT THE END OF THE PERMIAN
PeterWard_2008 MANY OF THESE MASS EXTINCTION BOUNDARIES THIS IS WHAT WE FIND ISORENIERATENE IT'S VERY SPECIFIC IT CAN ONLY OCCUR IF THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN HAS NO OXYGEN AND IS TOTALLY
PeterWard_2008 WITH HYDROGEN SULFIDE ENOUGH FOR INSTANCE TO COME OUT OF SOLUTION
PeterWard_2008 AND OTHERS FROM PENN STATE AND MY GROUP TO PROPOSE WHAT I CALL THE KUMP HYPOTHESIS MANY OF THE MASS EXTINCTIONS WERE CAUSED BY LOWERING OXYGEN
PeterWard_2008 BY HIGH CO TWO AAND THE WORST EFFECT OF GLOBAL WARMING IT TURNS OUT HYDROGEN SULFIDE BEING PRODUCED OUT OF THE OCEANS
PeterWard_2008 THE SOURCE OF THIS IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE SOURCE OVER AND OVER HAS BEEN FLOOD BASALTS THIS IS A VIEW OF THE EARTH NOW IF WE EXTRACT A LOT OF IT
PeterWard_2008 AND EACH OF THESE LOOKS LIKE A HYDROGEN BOMB ACTUALLY THE EFFECTS ARE EVEN WORSE THIS IS WHEN DEEP EARTH MATERIAL COMES TO THE SURFACE SPREADS OUT OVER THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET
PeterWard_2008 NOT THE LAVA THAT KILLS ANYTHING IT'S THE CARBON DIOXIDE THAT COMES OUT WITH IT THIS ISN'T VOLVOS THIS IS VOLCANOES BUT CARBON DIOXIDE IS CARBON DIOXIDE
PeterWard_2008 SO THESE ARE NEW DATA ROB BERNER AND I FROM YALE PUT TOGETHER AND WHAT WE TRY TO DO NOW IS TRACK THE AMOUNT OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE ENTIRE ROCK RECORD AND WE CAN DO THIS FROM A VARIETY OF MEANS
PeterWard_2008 AND PUT ALL THE RED LINES HERE WHEN THESE WHAT I CALL GREENHOUSE MASS EXTINCTIONS TOOK PLACE AND THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT ARE REALLY EVIDENT HERE TO ME IS THAT THESE EXTINCTIONS TAKE PLACE WHEN CO TWO IS GOING UP
PeterWard_2008 BUT THE SECOND THING THAT'S NOT SHOWN ON HERE THE EARTH HAS NEVER HAD ANY ICE ON IT WHEN WE'VE HAD A THOUSAND PARTS PER MILLION
PeterWard_2008 SO THERE GOES THE ICE CAPS AND THERE COMES TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET OF SEA LEVEL RISE I LIVE IN A VIEW HOUSE NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE WATERFRONT
PeterWard_2008 AND WE THINK THIS IS THE REASON THAT COMPLEXITY TOOK SO LONG TO TAKE PLACE ON PLANET EARTH WE HAD THESE HYDROGEN SULFIDE OCEANS FOR A VERY GREAT LONG PERIOD THEY STOP COMPLEX LIFE FROM EXISTING
PeterWard_2008 WE KNOW HYDROGEN SULFIDE IS ERUPTING PRESENTLY A FEW PLACES ON THE PLANET
PeterWard_2008 AND I THROW THIS SLIDE IN THIS IS ME ACTUALLY TWO MONTHS AGO AND I THROW THIS SLIDE IN BECAUSE HERE IS MY FAVORITE ANIMAL CHAMBERED NAUTILUS IT'S BEEN ON THIS PLANET SINCE THE ANIMALS FIRST STARTED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS
PeterWard_2008 SO I'M SWIMMING ALONG AND IT TAKES OFF MY LEG I'M EIGHTY MILES FROM SHORE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME WELL NOW I DIE
PeterWard_2008 AND I COULD BE TAKEN TO A CRITICAL CARE HOSPITAL
PeterWard_2008 AND THE REASON I COULD DO THAT IS BECAUSE WE MAMMALS HAVE GONE THROUGH A SERIES OF THESE HYDROGEN SULFIDE EVENTS AND OUR BODIES HAVE ADAPTED AND WE CAN NOW USE THIS AS WHAT I THINK WILL BE A MAJOR MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH
PeterWard_2008 AFTER BATTLEFIELD INJURIES HE BLEEDS OUT PIGS HE PUTS IN EIGHTY PARTS PER MILLION HYDROGEN SULFIDE THE SAME STUFF THAT SURVIVED THESE PAST MASS EXTINCTIONS AND HE TURNS A MAMMAL INTO A REPTILE
PeterWard_2008 I BELIEVE WE ARE SEEING IN THIS RESPONSE THE RESULT OF MAMMALS AND REPTILES HAVING UNDERGONE A SERIES OF EXPOSURES TO H TWO S I GOT THIS EMAIL FROM HIM TWO YEARS AGO HE SAID I THINK I'VE GOT AN ANSWER TO SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS
PeterWard_2008 SO HE NOW HAS TAKEN MICE DOWN FOR AS MANY AS FOUR HOURS SOMETIMES SIX HOURS AND THESE ARE BRAND NEW DATA HE SENT ME ON THE WAY OVER HERE ON THE TOP NOW THAT IS A TEMPERATURE RECORD OF A MOUSE
PeterWard_2008 WHO HAS GONE THROUGH THE DOTTED LINE THE TEMPERATURES SO THE TEMPERATURE STARTS AT TWENTY FIVE CENTIGRADE AND DOWN IT GOES DOWN IT GOES SIX HOURS LATER UP GOES THE TEMPERATURE
PeterWard_2008 NOW THE SAME MOUSE IS GIVEN EIGHTY PARTS PER MILLION HYDROGEN SULFIDE IN THIS SOLID GRAPH AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENS TO ITS TEMPERATURE
PeterWard_2008 ITS TEMPERATURE DROPS IT GOES DOWN TO FIFTEEN DEGREES CENTIGRADE FROM THIRTY FIVE
PeterWard_2008 COMES OUT OF THIS PERFECTLY FINE HERE IS A WAY WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO CRITICAL CARE HERE 'S HOW WE CAN BRING PEOPLE COLD ENOUGH
PeterWard_2008 LAST TILL WE GET CRITICAL CARE NOW YOU'RE ALL THINKING YEAH WHAT ABOUT THE BRAIN TISSUE
PeterWard_2008 THIS IS COMING TOWARDS US AND I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A REVOLUTION WE'RE GOING TO SAVE LIVES BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE A COST TO IT THE NEW VIEW OF MASS EXTINCTIONS IS YES WE WERE HIT AND YES WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE LONG TERM BECAUSE WE WILL GET HIT AGAIN BUT THERE'S A FAR WORSE DANGER CONFRONTING US
PeterWard_2008 WE CAN EASILY GO BACK TO THE HYDROGEN SULFIDE WORLD
PeterWard_2008 HOW MANY OF US FLEW HERE
PeterWard_2008 HOW MANY OF US HAVE GONE THROUGH OUR ENTIRE KYOTO QUOTA JUST FOR FLYING THIS YEAR HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE EXCEEDED IT YEAH I'VE CERTAINLY EXCEEDED IT WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM FACING US AS A SPECIES
PeterWard_2008 WE HAVE TO BEAT THIS
PeterWard_2008 ONE QUESTION FOR YOU PETER AM I UNDERSTANDING YOU RIGHT THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HERE IS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR OWN BODIES A BIOCHEMICAL RESPONSE
PeterWard_2008 TO HYDROGEN SULFIDE THAT IN YOUR MIND PROVES THAT THERE HAVE BEEN PAST MASS EXTINCTIONS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE
