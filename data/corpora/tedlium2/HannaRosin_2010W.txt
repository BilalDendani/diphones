HannaRosin_2010W@15.45:22.92 WE ARE NOW GOING THROUGH AN AMAZING AND UNPRECEDENTED MOMENT WHERE THE POWER DYNAMICS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN ARE SHIFTING VERY RAPIDLY
HannaRosin_2010W@23.34:26.36 AND IN MANY OF THE PLACES WHERE IT COUNTS THE MOST WOMEN ARE
HannaRosin_2010W@27.18:36.86 TAKING CONTROL OF EVERYTHING IN MY MOTHER 'S DAY SHE DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE NOT A LOT OF WOMEN DID AND NOW FOR EVERY TWO MEN WHO GET A COLLEGE DEGREE THREE WOMEN WILL DO THE SAME
HannaRosin_2010W@37.60:48.06 WOMEN FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR BECAME THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN WORKFORCE AND THEY'RE STARTING TO DOMINATE LOTS OF PROFESSIONS DOCTORS LAWYERS BANKERS ACCOUNTANTS
HannaRosin_2010W@48.99:55.67 OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF MANAGERS ARE WOMEN THESE DAYS AND IN THE FIFTEEN PROFESSIONS PROJECTED TO GROW THE MOST IN THE NEXT DECADE
HannaRosin_2010W@56.06:63.70 ALL BUT TWO OF THEM ARE DOMINATED BY WOMEN SO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IS BECOMING A PLACE WHERE WOMEN ARE MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN MEN BELIEVE IT OR NOT AND
HannaRosin_2010W@88.44:93.05 WHO IS A PARODY OF AMERICAN MANHOOD AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR COMMERCIALS TODAY
HannaRosin_2010W@94.25:102.42 THE PHRASE FIRST BORN SON IS SO DEEPLY INGRAINED IN OUR CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THIS STATISTIC ALONE SHOCKED ME IN AMERICAN FERTILITY CLINICS
HannaRosin_2010W@102.82:110.31 SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF COUPLES ARE REQUESTING GIRLS AND NOT BOYS AND IN PLACES WHERE YOU WOULDN'T THINK SUCH AS SOUTH KOREA
HannaRosin_2010W@110.76:119.32 INDIA AND CHINA THE VERY STRICT PATRIARCHAL SOCIETIES ARE STARTING TO BREAK DOWN A LITTLE AND FAMILIES ARE NO LONGER STRONGLY PREFERRING FIRST BORN SONS
HannaRosin_2010W@120.46:128.41 IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS IF YOU JUST OPEN YOUR EYES TO THIS POSSIBILITY AND START TO CONNECT THE DOTS YOU CAN SEE THE EVIDENCE EVERYWHERE YOU CAN SEE IT IN
HannaRosin_2010W@128.74:142.96 COLLEGE GRADUATION PATTERNS IN JOB PROJECTIONS IN OUR MARRIAGE STATISTICS YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE ICELANDIC ELECTIONS WHICH YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT LATER AND YOU CAN SEE IT ON SOUTH KOREAN SURVEYS ON SON PREFERENCE THAT SOMETHING AMAZING AND UNPRECEDENTED IS HAPPENING WITH WOMEN
HannaRosin_2010W@157.07:164.70 THIS TIME IT'S NOT ABOUT PASSION AND IT'S NOT ABOUT ANY KIND OF MOVEMENT THIS IS REALLY JUST ABOUT THE FACTS OF THIS ECONOMIC MOMENT THAT WE LIVE IN
HannaRosin_2010W@165.25:173.00 THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND YEAR PERIOD IN WHICH MEN HAVE BEEN TOP DOG IS TRULY COMING TO AN END BELIEVE IT OR NOT AND THAT'S WHY I TALK ABOUT THE END OF
HannaRosin_2010W@174.68:184.37 NOW ALL YOU MEN OUT THERE THIS IS NOT THE MOMENT WHERE YOU TUNE OUT OR THROW SOME TOMATOES BECAUSE THE POINT IS THAT THIS IS HAPPENING TO ALL OF US I MYSELF HAVE
HannaRosin_2010W@199.80:207.88 FIRST STARTED THINKING ABOUT THIS ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO I WAS READING HEADLINES ABOUT THE RECESSION JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE AND I STARTED TO NOTICE A DISTINCT PATTERN
HannaRosin_2010W@218.07:231.90 CALLED STIFFED THE BETRAYAL OF THE AMERICAN MAN IN WHICH SHE DESCRIBED HOW HARD THE RECESSION HAD HIT MEN AND I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER IT HAD GOTTEN WORSE THIS TIME AROUND IN THIS RECESSION AND I REALIZED THAT TWO THINGS WERE DIFFERENT THIS TIME AROUND
HannaRosin_2010W@232.21:245.06 THE FIRST WAS THAT THESE WERE NO LONGER JUST TEMPORARY HITS THAT THE RECESSION WAS GIVING MEN THAT THIS WAS REFLECTING A DEEPER UNDERLYING SHIFT IN OUR GLOBAL ECONOMY AND SECOND THAT THE STORY WAS NO LONGER JUST ABOUT THE CRISIS OF MEN
HannaRosin_2010W@248.49:260.67 AND NOW LOOK AT THIS SECOND SET OF SLIDES THESE ARE HEADLINES ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON WITH WOMEN IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS THESE ARE THINGS WE NEVER COULD HAVE IMAGINED A FEW YEARS AGO WOMEN A MAJORITY OF THE WORKPLACE AND LABOR STATISTICS WOMEN TAKE UP MOST MANAGERIAL JOBS
HannaRosin_2010W@261.00:269.32 THIS SECOND SET OF HEADLINES YOU CAN SEE THAT FAMILIES AND MARRIAGES ARE STARTING TO SHIFT AND LOOK AT THAT LAST HEADLINE YOUNG WOMEN EARNING MORE THAN YOUNG MEN
HannaRosin_2010W@269.95:278.53 THAT PARTICULAR HEADLINE COMES TO ME FROM A MARKET RESEARCH FIRM THEY WERE BASICALLY ASKED BY ONE OF THEIR CLIENTS WHO WAS GOING TO BUY HOUSES IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE FUTURE
HannaRosin_2010W@287.27:294.76 MAJOR PURCHASERS OF HOUSES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND SO THEY DECIDED BECAUSE THEY WERE INTRIGUED BY THIS FINDING TO DO A NATIONWIDE SURVEY
HannaRosin_2010W@295.26:304.92 SO THEY SPREAD OUT ALL THE CENSUS DATA AND WHAT THEY FOUND THE GUY DESCRIBED TO ME AS A SHOCKER WHICH IS THAT IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN OUT OF TWO THOUSAND COMMUNITIES
HannaRosin_2010W@305.41:316.23 WOMEN YOUNG WOMEN WERE MAKING MORE MONEY THAN YOUNG MEN SO HERE YOU HAVE A GENERATION OF YOUNG WOMEN WHO GROW UP THINKING OF THEMSELVES AS BEING MORE POWERFUL EARNERS THAN THE YOUNG MEN AROUND
HannaRosin_2010W@317.28:324.98 NOW I'VE JUST LAID OUT THE PICTURE FOR YOU BUT I STILL HAVEN'T EXPLAINED TO YOU WHY THIS IS HAPPENING AND IN A MOMENT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A GRAPH
HannaRosin_2010W@333.64:340.73 AND BASICALLY WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS WHAT ECONOMISTS TALK ABOUT AS THE POLARIZATION OF THE ECONOMY NOW WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
HannaRosin_2010W@340.95:354.89 IT MEANS THAT THE ECONOMY IS DIVIDING INTO HIGH SKILL HIGH WAGE JOBS AND LOW SKILL LOW WAGE JOBS AND THAT THE MIDDLE THE MIDDLE SKILL JOBS AND THE MIDDLE EARNING JOBS ARE STARTING TO DROP OUT OF THE ECONOMY THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR FORTY YEARS NOW
HannaRosin_2010W@370.39:381.88 SO WATCH THAT YOU SEE THEM BOTH DROP OUT OF THE MIDDLE CLASS WATCH WHAT HAPPENS TO THE WOMEN WATCH WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MEN THE MEN SORT OF STAGNATE THERE WHILE THE WOMEN ZOOM UP IN THOSE HIGH SKILL JOBS SO WHAT'S THAT ABOUT
HannaRosin_2010W@382.21:395.88 IT LOOKS LIKE WOMEN GOT SOME POWER BOOST ON A VIDEO GAME OR LIKE THEY SNUCK IN SOME SECRET SERUM INTO THEIR BIRTH CONTROL PILLS THAT LETS THEM SHOOT UP HIGH BUT OF COURSE IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT WHAT IT'S ABOUT IS THAT THE ECONOMY HAS CHANGED A LOT WE
HannaRosin_2010W@396.27:404.55 HAVE A MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH WAS ABOUT BUILDING GOODS AND PRODUCTS AND NOW WE HAVE A SERVICE ECONOMY AND AN INFORMATION AND CREATIVE ECONOMY
HannaRosin_2010W@405.13:412.43 THOSE TWO ECONOMIES REQUIRE VERY DIFFERENT SKILLS AND AS IT HAPPENS WOMEN HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER AT ACQUIRING THE NEW SET OF SKILLS THAN MEN HAVE BEEN
HannaRosin_2010W@413.30:424.70 USED TO BE THAT YOU WERE A GUY WHO WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WHO DIDN'T HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE BUT YOU HAD A SPECIFIC SET OF SKILLS AND WITH THE HELP OF A UNION YOU COULD MAKE YOURSELF A PRETTY GOOD MIDDLE CLASS LIFE
HannaRosin_2010W@425.01:435.64 BUT THAT REALLY ISN'T TRUE ANYMORE THIS NEW ECONOMY IS PRETTY INDIFFERENT TO SIZE AND STRENGTH WHICH IS WHAT'S HELPED MEN ALONG ALL THESE YEARS WHAT THE ECONOMY REQUIRES NOW IS A WHOLE
HannaRosin_2010W@443.33:452.58 TO BE ABLE TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE AND TO OPERATE IN A WORKPLACE THAT IS MUCH MORE FLUID THAN IT USED TO BE AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WOMEN DO EXTREMELY WELL AS WE'RE SEEING
HannaRosin_2010W@453.02:464.05 IF YOU LOOK AT MANAGEMENT THEORY THESE DAYS IT USED TO BE THAT OUR IDEAL LEADER SOUNDED SOMETHING LIKE GEN PATTON RIGHT YOU WOULD BE ISSUING ORDERS FROM ABOVE YOU WOULD BE VERY HIERARCHICAL YOU WOULD TELL EVERYONE BELOW YOU WHAT TO DO
HannaRosin_2010W@464.57:472.06 BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT AN IDEAL LEADER IS LIKE NOW IF YOU READ MANAGEMENT BOOKS NOW A LEADER IS SOMEBODY WHO CAN FOSTER CREATIVITY WHO CAN GET HIS
HannaRosin_2010W@472.37:482.06 GET THE EMPLOYEES SEE I STILL SAY HIS WHO CAN GET THE EMPLOYEES TO TALK TO EACH OTHER WHO CAN BASICALLY BUILD TEAMS AND GET THEM TO BE CREATIVE AND THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WOMEN DO VERY WELL
HannaRosin_2010W@482.52:494.77 AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT THAT'S CREATED A KIND OF CASCADING EFFECT WOMEN ENTER THE WORKPLACE AT THE TOP AND THEN AT THE WORKING CLASS ALL THE NEW JOBS THAT ARE CREATED ARE THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT WIVES USED TO DO FOR FREE AT HOME
HannaRosin_2010W@495.00:502.18 SO THAT'S CHILD CARE ELDER CARE AND FOOD PREPARATION SO THOSE ARE ALL THE JOBS THAT ARE GROWING AND THOSE ARE JOBS THAT WOMEN TEND TO DO
HannaRosin_2010W@503.01:514.59 NOW ONE DAY IT MIGHT BE THAT MOTHERS WILL HIRE AN OUT OF WORK MIDDLE AGED FORMER STEELWORKER GUY TO WATCH THEIR CHILDREN AT HOME AND THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE MEN BUT THAT HASN'T QUITE HAPPENED YET
HannaRosin_2010W@514.78:522.91 TO SEE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE WORKFORCE THAT IS NOW YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR FUTURE WORKFORCE AND HERE THE STORY IS FAIRLY SIMPLE
HannaRosin_2010W@523.74:527.30 WOMEN ARE GETTING COLLEGE DEGREES AT A FASTER RATE THAN MEN
HannaRosin_2010W@527.83:536.18 WHY THIS IS A REAL MYSTERY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED MEN WHY DON'T THEY JUST GO BACK TO COLLEGE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE SAY AND RETOOL THEMSELVES LEARN A NEW SET OF SKILLS
HannaRosin_2010W@536.40:549.77 WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT THEY'RE JUST VERY UNCOMFORTABLE DOING THAT THEY'RE USED TO THINKING OF THEMSELVES AS PROVIDERS AND THEY CAN'T SEEM TO BUILD THE SOCIAL NETWORKS THAT ALLOW THEM TO GET THROUGH COLLEGE SO FOR SOME REASON MEN JUST DON'T END UP GOING BACK TO COLLEGE
HannaRosin_2010W@550.14:557.90 AND WHAT'S EVEN MORE DISTURBING IS WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH YOUNGER BOYS THERE'S BEEN ABOUT A DECADE OF RESEARCH ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE CALLING THE BOY CRISIS
HannaRosin_2010W@558.10:564.97 NOW THE BOY CRISIS IS THIS IDEA THAT VERY YOUNG BOYS FOR WHATEVER REASON ARE DOING WORSE IN SCHOOL THAN VERY YOUNG GIRLS
HannaRosin_2010W@565.39:574.97 AND PEOPLE HAVE THEORIES ABOUT THAT IS IT BECAUSE WE HAVE AN EXCESSIVELY VERBAL CURRICULUM AND LITTLE GIRLS ARE BETTER AT THAT THAN LITTLE BOYS OR THAT WE REQUIRE KIDS TO SIT STILL TOO MUCH AND SO BOYS
HannaRosin_2010W@589.33:593.29 TEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER NOAH TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHY THE BOYS IN HER CLASS
HannaRosin_2010W@615.64:627.56 THIS WHOLE THESIS REALLY CAME HOME TO ME WHEN I WENT TO VISIT A COLLEGE IN KANSAS CITY WORKING CLASS COLLEGE CERTAINLY WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE I HAD CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS ABOUT MY LIFE THAT MY HUSBAND AND I WOULD
HannaRosin_2010W@627.84:634.70 BOTH WORK AND THAT WE WOULD EQUALLY RAISE THE CHILDREN BUT THESE COLLEGE GIRLS HAD A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT VIEW OF THEIR FUTURE
HannaRosin_2010W@635.35:644.28 BASICALLY THE WAY THEY SAID IT TO ME IS THAT THEY WOULD BE WORKING EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY THAT THEIR HUSBAND WOULD MAYBE HAVE A JOB BUT THAT MOSTLY HE WOULD BE AT HOME TAKING CARE OF THE KITTIES
HannaRosin_2010W@644.49:650.59 AND THIS WAS KIND OF A SHOCKER TO ME AND THEN HERE 'S MY FAVORITE QUOTE FROM ONE OF THE GIRLS MEN ARE THE NEW
HannaRosin_2010W@656.29:661.66 THAT QUOTE HAS KIND OF A STING TO IT RIGHT AND I THINK THE REASON IT HAS A STING IS BECAUSE
HannaRosin_2010W@662.63:670.49 OF YEARS OF HISTORY DON'T REVERSE THEMSELVES WITHOUT A LOT OF PAIN AND THAT'S WHY I TALK ABOUT US ALL GOING THROUGH THIS TOGETHER
HannaRosin_2010W@672.09:685.28 THE NIGHT AFTER I TALKED TO THESE COLLEGE GIRLS I ALSO WENT TO A MEN 'S GROUP IN KANSAS AND THESE WERE EXACTLY THE KIND OF VICTIMS OF THE MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH I SPOKE TO YOU ABOUT EARLIER THEY WERE MEN WHO HAD BEEN CONTRACTORS OR THEY HAD BEEN BUILDING HOUSES AND THEY HAD LOST THEIR JOBS
HannaRosin_2010W@685.46:696.30 THE HOUSING BOOM AND THEY WERE IN THIS GROUP BECAUSE THEY WERE FAILING TO PAY THEIR CHILD SUPPORT AND THE INSTRUCTOR WAS UP THERE IN THE CLASS EXPLAINING TO THEM ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY HAD LOST THEIR IDENTITY IN THIS NEW AGE
HannaRosin_2010W@696.93:705.22 HE WAS TELLING THEM THEY NO LONGER HAD ANY MORAL AUTHORITY THAT NOBODY NEEDED THEM FOR EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANYMORE AND THEY WERE NOT REALLY THE PROVIDERS SO WHO WERE
HannaRosin_2010W@717.71:726.17 YOUR SALARY SO WHO 'S THE MAN NOW HE ASKED THEM WHO 'S THE DAMN MAN SHE'S THE MAN NOW AND THAT REALLY SENT A SHUDDER THROUGH THE ROOM
HannaRosin_2010W@740.33:748.47 WOMEN ARE LEARNING ENGLISH FASTER THAN THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS IN ORDER TO STAFF THE NEW CALL CENTERS THAT ARE GROWING IN INDIA IN CHINA A LOT OF THE OPENING UP
HannaRosin_2010W@748.83:761.69 PRIVATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS HAPPENING BECAUSE WOMEN ARE STARTING BUSINESSES SMALL BUSINESSES FASTER THAN MEN AND HERE 'S MY FAVORITE EXAMPLE WHICH IS IN SOUTH KOREA OVER SEVERAL DECADES SOUTH KOREA BUILT ONE OF THE MOST PATRIARCHAL SOCIETIES WE KNOW ABOUT
HannaRosin_2010W@762.33:768.65 THEY BASICALLY ENSHRINED THE SECOND CLASS STATUS OF WOMEN IN THE CIVIL CODE AND IF WOMEN FAILED TO
HannaRosin_2010W@769.12:777.12 BIRTH MALE CHILDREN THEY WERE BASICALLY TREATED LIKE DOMESTIC SERVANTS AND SOMETIMES FAMILY WOULD PRAY TO THE SPIRITS TO KILL OFF A GIRL CHILD SO THEY COULD HAVE A MALE CHILD
HannaRosin_2010W@803.49:814.43 NOW BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T FULLY PROCESSED THIS INFORMATION IT'S KIND OF COMING BACK TO US IN OUR POP CULTURE IN THESE KIND OF WEIRD AND EXAGGERATED WAYS WHERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE STEREOTYPES ARE CHANGING
HannaRosin_2010W@814.72:829.48 AND SO WE HAVE ON THE MALE SIDE WHAT ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES LIKES TO CALL THE OMEGA MALES POPPING UP WHO ARE THE MALES WHO ARE ROMANTICALLY CHALLENGED LOSERS WHO CAN'T FIND A JOB AND THEY COME UP IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT FORMS SO WE HAVE THE PERPETUAL ADOLESCENT
HannaRosin_2010W@830.11:831.96 WE HAVE THE CHARMLESS MISANTHROPE
HannaRosin_2010W@833.14:843.46 WE HAVE OUR BUD LIGHT GUY WHO 'S THE HAPPY COUCH POTATO AND THEN HERE 'S A SHOCKER EVEN AMERICA 'S MOST SEXIEST MAN ALIVE THE SEXIEST MAN ALIVE GETS ROMANTICALLY PLAYED THESE DAYS IN A MOVIE
HannaRosin_2010W@843.89:851.43 AND THEN ON THE FEMALE SIDE YOU HAVE THE OPPOSITE IN WHICH YOU HAVE THESE CRAZY SUPERHERO WOMEN YOU'VE GOT LADY GAGA
HannaRosin_2010W@852.53:854.22 YOU'VE GOT OUR NEW JAMES BOND WHO 'S
HannaRosin_2010W@856.66:865.30 AND IT'S NOT JUST FOR THE YOUNG RIGHT EVEN HELEN MIRREN CAN HOLD A GUN THESE DAYS AND SO IT FEELS LIKE WE HAVE TO MOVE FROM THIS PLACE WHERE WE'VE GOT THESE
HannaRosin_2010W@875.17:883.95 NOW I'VE NEVER REALLY LIKED THIS TERM FOR ONE THING IT PUTS MEN AND WOMEN IN A REALLY ANTAGONISTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE THE MEN ARE THESE DEVIOUS TRICKSTERS UP THERE
HannaRosin_2010W@884.16:894.89 WHO 'VE PUT UP THIS GLASS CEILING AND WE'RE ALWAYS BELOW THE GLASS CEILING THE WOMEN AND WE HAVE A LOT OF SKILL AND EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S A TRICK SO HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO PREPARE TO GET THROUGH THAT GLASS CEILING
HannaRosin_2010W@895.26:902.99 AND ALSO SHATTERING THE GLASS CEILING IS A TERRIBLE PHRASE WHAT CRAZY PERSON WOULD POP THEIR HEAD THROUGH A GLASS CEILING SO
HannaRosin_2010W@903.65:908.27 THE IMAGE I LIKE TO THINK OF INSTEAD OF GLASS CEILING IS THE HIGH BRIDGE
HannaRosin_2010W@908.70:912.31 IT'S DEFINITELY TERRIFYING TO STAND AT THE FOOT OF A HIGH BRIDGE BUT IT'S ALSO
HannaRosin_2010W@919.35:927.92 THE GREAT THING IS THERE'S NO TRICK LIKE WITH THE GLASS CEILING THERE'S NO MAN OR WOMAN STANDING IN THE MIDDLE ABOUT TO CUT THE CABLES THERE'S NO HOLE IN THE MIDDLE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FALL THROUGH
HannaRosin_2010W@949.44:956.26 WALK ACROSS THE HIGH BRIDGE BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISION TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP AND DO IT
