PeterMolyneux_2010G@16.41:26.09 WHEN I SAW A PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY CALLED KINECT IT WAS CALLED NATAL I WAS INSPIRED AND I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE
PeterMolyneux_2010G@26.41:31.76 TO ADDRESS THAT ONE PROBLEM OF STORYTELLING TO CREATE A CHARACTER
PeterMolyneux_2010G@32.71:45.97 WHICH SEEMED ALIVE WHICH NOTICED ME THAT COULD LOOK ME IN THE EYES AND FEEL REAL AND SCULPT A STORY ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP AND SO A YEAR AGO

PeterMolyneux_2010G@56.14:64.55 AND THERE WAS A HUGE ROW ONLINE ABOUT HEY THIS CAN'T BE REAL AND SO I WAITED TILL NOW
PeterMolyneux_2010G@77.17:78.62 SOME INCREDIBLE
PeterMolyneux_2010G@80.00:82.37 THAT WAS HIDDEN IN THE DUSTY VAULTS
PeterMolyneux_2010G@83.45:86.12 COLLECTING DUST IN MICROSOFT
PeterMolyneux_2010G@100.14:104.27 REAL LIVING BEING IN A COMPUTER NOW
PeterMolyneux_2010G@104.91:109.20 I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU AND SAY THAT MOST OF IT IS JUST A
PeterMolyneux_2010G@110.36:118.01 BUT IT'S A TRICK THAT ACTUALLY WORKS SO WHY DON'T WE GO OVER AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE DEMO NOW THIS IS
PeterMolyneux_2010G@119.63:120.39 JUST WAGGLE YOUR
PeterMolyneux_2010G@123.08:133.11 NOW YOU NOTICE HE 'S SITTING THERE ARE NO CONTROLLERS NO KEYBOARDS OR MICE OR JOYSTICKS OR JOYPADS
PeterMolyneux_2010G@133.37:143.09 HE IS JUST GOING TO USE HIS HAND HIS BODY AND HIS VOICE JUST LIKE HUMANS INTERACT WITH THEIR HANDS BODY AND VOICE SO LET 'S MOVE FORWARD
PeterMolyneux_2010G@143.88:145.90 YOU'RE GOING TO MEET MILO FOR THE FIRST TIME
PeterMolyneux_2010G@147.24:148.95 WE HAD TO GIVE HIM A PROBLEM
PeterMolyneux_2010G@149.44:162.96 BECAUSE WHEN WE FIRST CREATED MILO WE REALIZED THAT HE CAME ACROSS AS A LITTLE BIT OF A BRAT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU HE WAS QUITE KNOW IT ALL AND HE WANTED TO KIND OF MAKE YOU LAUGH SO THE PROBLEM WE INTRODUCED TO HIM WAS THIS HE 'S JUST MOVED HOUSE
PeterMolyneux_2010G@163.27:169.76 HE 'S MOVED FROM LONDON TO NEW ENGLAND OVER IN AMERICA HIS PARENTS ARE TOO BUSY
PeterMolyneux_2010G@175.85:183.41 SO HERE HE IS WALKING THROUGH THE GRASS AND YOU'RE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH HIS WORLD THE COOL THING IS
PeterMolyneux_2010G@183.93:187.93 WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE CHANGING THE MIND OF
PeterMolyneux_2010G@189.72:192.07 THAT MEANS NO TWO PEOPLE 'S
PeterMolyneux_2010G@194.65:197.05 ACTUALLY SCULPTING A HUMAN BEING
PeterMolyneux_2010G@207.49:209.13 VERY SIMPLE AT THE START
PeterMolyneux_2010G@209.50:216.37 BY THE WAY IF YOU ARE A BOY IT'S SNAILS IF YOU'RE A GIRL IT'S BUTTERFLIES BECAUSE WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT
PeterMolyneux_2010G@224.71:230.35 SO REMEMBER THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE MET HIM AND WE REALLY WANT TO DRAW YOU IN AND MAKE YOU MORE CURIOUS
PeterMolyneux_2010G@233.01:244.26 HIS FACE BY THE WAY IS FULLY AI DRIVEN WE HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER HIS BLUSH RESPONSES THE DIAMETER OF HIS NOSTRILS TO DENOTE STRESS
PeterMolyneux_2010G@244.65:253.42 WE ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING CALLED BODY MATCHING IF YOU'RE LEANING FORWARD HE WILL TRY AND SLIGHTLY CHANGE THE NEUROLINGUISTIC NATURE OF HIS FACE
PeterMolyneux_2010G@253.99:257.92 BECAUSE WE WENT OUT WITH THIS STRONG IDEA HOW CAN WE MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING
PeterMolyneux_2010G@259.52:262.44 THE HAND THE OTHER THING TO USE IS YOUR BODY
PeterMolyneux_2010G@263.58:273.80 WHY NOT JUST INSTEAD OF PUSHING LEFT AND RIGHT WITH A MOUSE OR WITH A JOYPAD WHY NOT USE YOUR BODY JUST TO LEAN ON THE CHAIR AGAIN RELAXED YOU CAN
PeterMolyneux_2010G@275.14:278.27 BUT THE CAMERA WILL CHANGE ITS PERSPECTIVE DEPENDING ON WHICH
PeterMolyneux_2010G@281.81:285.31 TO USE HE 'S USED HIS HAND HE 'S USED HIS BODY
PeterMolyneux_2010G@285.68:289.23 HE 'S NOW GOING TO USE THE OTHER THING WHICH IS ESSENTIAL AND THAT'S HIS VOICE
PeterMolyneux_2010G@290.36:299.88 THE THING ABOUT VOICE IS OUR EXPERIENCE WITH VOICE RECOGNITION IS PRETTY AWFUL ISN'T IT IT NEVER WORKS YOU ORDER AN AIRLINE TICKET YOU END UP
PeterMolyneux_2010G@302.36:306.26 SO WE'VE TACKLED THAT PROBLEM AND WE'VE COME UP WITH A SOLUTION WE'LL SEE IN
PeterMolyneux_2010G@355.17:359.27 NOW WE NEED TO HAVE A BIT MORE ENGAGEMENT AND AGAIN WHAT WE CAN DO IS
PeterMolyneux_2010G@360.05:362.33 WE CAN LOOK AT THE BODY AND
PeterMolyneux_2010G@377.00:388.93 SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NOW IS TEACH MILO TO SKIM STONES WE'RE ACTUALLY TEACHING HIM IT'S VERY VERY INTERESTING THAT MEN MORE THAN WOMEN TEND TO BE MORE COMPETITIVE
PeterMolyneux_2010G@391.89:399.55 TEACHING MILO FOR THE FIRST FEW THROWS BUT THEN THEY WANT TO BEAT MILO WHERE WOMEN THEY'RE MORE NURTURING ABOUT THIS
PeterMolyneux_2010G@404.55:407.39 THIS IS SKIMMING STONES HOW DO YOU SKIM STONES
PeterMolyneux_2010G@409.15:410.09 YOU STAND UP
PeterMolyneux_2010G@411.36:414.60 AND YOU SKIM THE STONE IT'S THAT SIMPLE
PeterMolyneux_2010G@424.84:431.39 AGAIN ALL OF THIS IS DONE IN THE WAY US HUMANS DO THINGS AND THAT'S CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT IF WE
PeterMolyneux_2010G@454.05:458.37 MOST COMPETITIVE NOW BEATEN AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD CHILD
PeterMolyneux_2010G@464.26:474.27 CALLED BACK IN BY HIS PARENTS GIVING US TIME TO BE ALONE AND TO HELP HIM OUT BASICALLY THE BIT THAT WE MISSED AT THE START HIS PARENTS HAD ASKED HIM TO CLEAN UP HIS ROOM
PeterMolyneux_2010G@474.67:484.61 GOING TO HELP HIM WITH THIS NOW BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE AN INTRODUCTION AND THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE DEEP PSYCHOLOGY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO USE WE'RE TRYING TO INTRODUCE YOU TO WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE
PeterMolyneux_2010G@484.89:490.83 MOST WONDERFUL PART YOU BEING ABLE TO TALK IN YOUR NATURAL VOICE TO
PeterMolyneux_2010G@491.59:497.61 NOW TO DO THAT WE NEEDED A SET UP LIKE A MAGICIAN 'S TRICK AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE NEEDED TO

PeterMolyneux_2010G@518.48:529.91 WE'VE ALL DONE IT AS PARENTS WE'VE ALL DONE IT AS CHILDREN NOW 'S A CHANCE FOR DIMITRI TO KIND OF REASSURE AND CALM MILO DOWN IT'S ALL BEEN TOO MUCH FOR HIM HE 'S JUST MOVED HOUSE HE 'S GOT NO FRIENDS
PeterMolyneux_2010G@531.18:535.14 NOW IS THE TIME WHEN WE OPEN THAT PORTAL AND ALLOW YOU TO TALK TO
PeterMolyneux_2010G@540.34:540.68 TO
PeterMolyneux_2010G@543.30:544.53 YOU KNOW WHAT PARENTS ARE LIKE

PeterMolyneux_2010G@611.05:619.26 YOU KNOW MANY ADVENTURES SOME OF THOSE ADVENTURES ARE A LITTLE BIT DARK OR ON THE DARKER SIDE SOME OF THOSE ADVENTURES ARE WONDERFULLY ENCOURAGING HE 'S GOT TO GO TO SCHOOL
PeterMolyneux_2010G@619.98:630.39 THE COOL THING IS THAT WE'RE DOING AS WELL AS YOU INTERACT WITH HIM YOU'RE ABLE TO PUT THINGS INTO HIS WORLD AND HE RECOGNIZES OBJECTS HIS MIND IS BASED IN
PeterMolyneux_2010G@631.91:639.29 THAT MEANS MILO 'S MIND AS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE USE IT WILL GET SMARTER AND CLEVERER HE'LL RECOGNIZE MORE OBJECTS
PeterMolyneux_2010G@639.56:647.77 AND THUS UNDERSTAND MORE WORDS BUT FOR ME THIS IS A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY WHERE TECHNOLOGY AT LAST CAN BE CONNECTED
PeterMolyneux_2010G@648.82:658.66 WHERE I AM NO LONGER RESTRAINED BY THE FINGER I HOLD IN MY HAND AS FAR AS A COMPUTER GAME 'S CONCERNED OR BY THE BLANDNESS OF NOT BEING NOTICED IF YOU'RE WATCHING A FILM
