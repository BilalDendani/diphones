ShimonSteinberg_2010X@21.76:26.05 WHEN I BACHELORED MAJORING IN ZOOLOGY IN TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@37.77:39.82 HOW CAN I BE PRACTICAL OR
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@44.51:46.67 PLANT PROTECTION PLANT PROTECTION
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@52.69:54.13 I CAME INTO THE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@59.56:67.46 USE OF LIVING ORGANISMS TO REDUCE POPULATIONS OF NOXIOUS PLANT PESTS SO IT'S A WHOLE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@71.67:73.89 OF CHEMICALS AND
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@77.64:81.66 ABOUT THEY'VE EXISTED IN THE WORLD FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@82.66:86.93 LONG LONG TIME BUT ONLY IN THE LAST ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@87.77:95.83 PEOPLE STARTED OR PEOPLE KNEW MORE AND MORE HOW TO EXPLOIT OR HOW TO USE THIS BIOLOGICAL CONTROL PHENOMENON OR
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@98.82:101.03 TO THEIR OWN NEEDS
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@105.31:106.05 JUST
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@112.26:116.66 JUST OPEN IT YOU JUST TWIST LEAVES AND YOU SEE A WHOLE NEW WORLD
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@123.01:128.10 LONG AND YOU CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE GOOD ONES AND THE BAD ONES SO THIS PHENOMENON OF
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@133.17:134.07 JUST HAVE A
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@141.04:141.38 AND
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@143.05:146.53 JUST A FEW EXAMPLES WHAT IS A PEST WHAT
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@157.20:164.09 GOING TO TALK ABOUT INSECTS AND SPIDERS OR MITES LET US CALL THEM INSECTS THOSE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@166.89:175.18 OR MITES THE EIGHT LEGGED ORGANISMS LET 'S HAVE A LOOK AT THAT HERE IS A PEST DEVASTATING PEST A SPIDER MITE BECAUSE IT
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@178.21:185.30 YOU SEE THE MOTHER IN BETWEEN AND TWO DAUGHTERS PROBABLY ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT AND A SINGLE EGG ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE AND THEN YOU SEE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@186.65:196.33 ON YOUR RIGHT HAND SIDE YOU CAN SEE A CUCUMBER LEAF AND ON THE MIDDLE COTTON LEAF AND ON THE LEFT A TOMATO LEAF WITH THESE LITTLE LEAVES THEY CAN LITERALLY TURN FROM GREEN TO
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@197.53:199.99 THE SUCKING PIERCING
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@200.62:203.03 PARTS OF THOSE SPIDERS
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@203.17:209.97 BUT HERE COMES NATURE THAT PROVIDES US WITH A GOOD SPIDER THIS IS A PREDATORY MITE JUST AS SMALL AS A SPIDER MITE BY THE WAY
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@211.44:219.35 LONG NOT MORE THAN THAT RUNNING QUICKLY HUNTING CHASING THE SPIDER MITES AND HERE YOU CAN SEE THIS LADY IN ACTION
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@221.54:224.57 JUST PIERCES SUCH THE BODY FLUIDS ON THE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@230.72:230.93 THE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@237.62:250.02 SATIATED INDIVIDUALS OF PREDATORY MITES A MOTHER ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE A YOUNG NYMPH ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE BY THE WAY A MEAL FOR THEM FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS IS ABOUT FIVE INDIVIDUALS OF THE SPIDER MITES OF
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@251.81:253.59 OR FIFTEEN TO TWENTY
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@266.77:267.73 SHARPLY YOU CAN SEE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@267.96:268.99 THOSE BAD ONES THOSE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@269.89:278.27 ALL OVER THE PLANTS IN YOUR HIBISCUS IN YOUR LANTANA IN THE YOUNG FRESH FOLIAGE OF THE SPRING FLUSH SO
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@298.96:306.13 CALLED HONEYDEW AND THIS JUST GLOBS THE UPPER PARTS OF THE PLANT HERE YOU SEE A TYPICAL CUCUMBER LEAF THAT
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@306.70:314.00 FROM GREEN TO BLACK BECAUSE OF A BLACK FUNGUS SOOTY MOLD WHICH IS COVERING IT AND HERE COMES THE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@315.84:324.60 THROUGH THIS PARASITIC WASP HERE WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT A PREDATOR HERE WE ARE TALKING A PARASITE NOT A TWO LEGGED PARASITE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@327.82:332.33 THIS IS A PARASITIC WASP AGAIN TWO MILLIMETERS LONG SLENDER A
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@333.99:340.67 SHARP FLIER AND HERE YOU CAN SEE THIS PARASITE IN ACTION LIKE IN AN ACROBATIC MANEUVER
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@351.60:352.04 OF
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@355.55:355.82 SHE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@356.80:364.45 AND BITES AND SECRETES DIFFERENT LIQUIDS BUT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN IN FACT ONLY THE EGG OF THE PARASITE WILL BE BE INSERTED
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@365.04:376.05 THE BODY FLUIDS OF THE APHID AND AFTER A FEW DAYS DEPENDING UPON TEMPERATURE THE EGG WILL HATCH AND THE LARVA OF THIS PARASITOID WILL EAT THE APHID FROM THE INSIDE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@382.53:383.52 YOUR
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@417.90:427.10 TIME IS VERY SHORT THIS FEMALE CAN LIVE ONLY THREE TO FOUR DAYS AND SHE NEEDS TO GIVE RISE TO AROUND FOUR HUNDRED HUNDRED EGGS THAT MEANS SHE HAS FOUR HUNDRED
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@428.17:431.55 A WHOLE WEALTH OF OTHER
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@436.96:438.49 THE LAST EXAMPLE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@440.10:445.42 THE PEST THE THRIPS BY THE WAY ALL THESE WEIRD NAMES I
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@453.94:467.98 YOU CAN SEE THIS SWEET PEPPERS THIS IS NOT JUST AN EXOTIC ORNAMENTAL SWEET PEPPER THIS IS A SWEET PEPPER WHICH IS NOT CONSUMABLE BECAUSE IT IS SUFFERING FROM A VIRAL DISEASE TRANSMITTED BY THOSE THRIP ADULTS
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@473.07:477.35 SMALL HERE YOU CAN SEE THE ADULT BLACK AND TWO YOUNG
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@491.83:494.70 THE GOOD ONES FOR EXAMPLE IN A SWEET PEPPER
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@505.67:513.51 SO THIS IS A VERY POSITIVE SITUATION BY THE WAY NO HARM TO THE DEVELOPING FRUIT NO HARM TO THE FRUIT SET EVERYTHING IS JUST FINE UNDER THESE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@516.76:518.48 YOU SAW THEM ON A ONE TO ONE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@523.01:525.46 ACTUALLY THIS IN
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@534.43:535.21 WHAT WE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@538.07:540.33 THE NATURAL CONTROL
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@542.22:544.12 THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND SQ METERS OF
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@544.84:555.68 STATE OF THE ART GREENHOUSES THERE WE ARE ARE MASS PRODUCING THOSE PREDATORY MITES THOSE MINUTE PIRATE BUGS THOSE PARASITIC WASPS ETC ETC MANY DIFFERENT PARTS
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@564.88:568.08 AND A NICE HOT SUMMER WHICH IS AN EXCELLENT CONDITION
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@569.49:578.70 THOSE CREATURES AND BY THE WAY MASS PRODUCTION IT IS NOT GENETIC MANIPULATION THERE ARE NO GMO 'S GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS WHATSOEVER
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@580.11:590.47 NATURE AND THE ONLY THING THAT WE DO WE GIVE THEM THE OPTIMAL CONDITIONS UNDER THE GREENHOUSES OR IN THE CLIMATE ROOMS IN ORDER TO PROLIFERATE MULTIPLY AND
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@592.83:594.94 IN FACT YOU SEE UNDER A MICROSCOPE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@599.53:601.94 THE WHOLE BUNCH OF PREDATORY MITES YOU SEE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@603.16:607.07 THIS ONE I HAVE ONE GRAM OF THOSE PREDATORY MITES
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@609.41:611.21 EIGHTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@612.04:614.70 EIGHTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ARE GOOD ENOUGH
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@626.47:630.14 AND WE CAN PRODUCE FROM THIS BELIEVE YOU ME
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@632.73:644.51 ON AN ANNUAL BASIS SO THIS IS WHAT I CALL AMPLIFICATION OF THE PHENOMENON AND NO WE DO NOT DISRUPT THE BALANCE ON THE CONTRARY BECAUSE WE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@665.46:666.78 ACTUALLY SEE WHAT IS
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@668.02:673.88 SUCCESSFUL BIOLOGICAL CONTROL BY GOOD BUGS FOR EXAMPLE IN ISRAEL WHERE WE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@676.11:686.52 MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND HECTARES TEN THOUSAND DUNAMS IN ISRAELI TERMS OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROLLING SWEET PEPPER UNDER PROTECTION SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@691.61:697.07 EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PESTICIDES ESPECIALLY THOSE AIMED AGAINST PEST MITES
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@698.21:699.68 SO THE IMPACT IS
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@716.43:720.05 BUT IF WE GO FOR EXAMPLE TO THIS PLACE SOUTHEAST
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@720.98:730.41 THE ARAVA AREA ABOVE THE GREAT RIFT VALLEY WHERE THE REALLY TOP NOTCH THE PEARL OF THE ISRAELI AGRICULTURE IS LOCATED ESPECIALLY
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@731.53:741.18 OR UNDER SCREENHOUSE CONDITIONS IF YOU DRIVE ALL THE WAY TO EILAT YOU SEE THIS JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT AND IF YOU ZOOM IN YOU CAN DEFINITELY WATCH THIS
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@757.25:758.64 GROWERS WHY
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@765.08:767.65 FROM THE IDEA OF RESISTANCE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@768.36:774.36 THAT THE PESTS WILL BECOME RESISTANT TO THE CHEMICALS JUST IN OUR CASE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@794.02:796.00 RESISTANCE WHICH HAPPENS IN THE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@797.10:798.20 AND THIRDLY
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@801.73:802.82 THE MORE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@806.01:814.38 GROWERS BECOME AWARE OF THE FACT THEY SHOULD WHEREVER THEY CAN AND WHEREVER POSSIBLE REPLACE THE CHEMICAL CONTROL
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@816.16:826.02 EVEN HERE THERE IS ANOTHER GROWER YOU SEE VERY INTERESTED IN THE BUGS THE BAD ONES AND THE GOOD ONES WEARING THIS MAGNIFIER ALREADY ON HER HEAD JUST WALKING SAFELY IN HER
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@827.57:831.76 FINALLY I WANT TO GET ACTUALLY TO MY VISION OR IN FACT TO MY
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@849.47:853.14 I THINK IT'S TIMES ONE HUNDRED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TWENTY FIVE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@854.11:856.68 SO THERE IS A HUGE GAP TO BRIDGE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@866.30:871.30 MORE ROBUST GOOD AND RELIABLE BIOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS MORE
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@875.36:876.53 OR ACTUALLY
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@879.26:892.28 CREATE EVEN MORE INTENSIVE AND STRICT PUBLIC DEMAND TO REDUCTION OF CHEMICALS IN THE AGRICULTURAL FRESH PRODUCE AND THIRDLY ALSO TO INCREASE AWARENESS BY THE GROWERS TO THE POTENTIAL OF
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@893.72:893.91 AND
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@899.91:901.68 SO I THINK MY LAST SLIDE IS
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@902.20:911.61 ALL WE ARE SAYING WE CAN ACTUALLY SING IT GIVE NATURE A CHANCE SO I'M SAYING IT ON BEHALF OF ALL THE BIOCONTROL PETITIONERS AND IMPLEMENTORS IN ISRAEL
ShimonSteinberg_2010X@912.14:914.15 AND ABROAD REALLY
