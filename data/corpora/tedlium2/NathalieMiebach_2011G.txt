NathalieMiebach_2011G@40.19:59.1 WHAT YOU JUST HEARD ARE THE INTERACTIONS OF BAROMETRIC PRESSURE WIND AND TEMPERATURE READINGS THAT WERE RECORDED OF HURRICANE NOEL IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THE MUSICIANS PLAYED OFF A THREE DIMENSIONAL GRAPH OF WEATHER DATA LIKE THIS EVERY SINGLE BEAD EVERY SINGLE COLORED BAND REPRESENTS A WEATHER ELEMENT THAT CAN ALSO BE READ AS A MUSICAL NOTE
NathalieMiebach_2011G@59.1:77.38 I FIND WEATHER EXTREMELY FASCINATING WEATHER IS AN AMALGAM OF SYSTEMS THAT IS INHERENTLY INVISIBLE TO MOST OF US SO I USE SCULPTURE AND MUSIC TO MAKE IT NOT JUST VISIBLE BUT ALSO TACTILE AND AUDIBLE ALL OF MY WORK BEGINS VERY SIMPLE I EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM A SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT USING VERY LOW TECH
NathalieMiebach_2011G@77.38:85.95 DATA COLLECTING DEVICES GENERALLY ANYTHING I CAN FIND IN THE HARDWARE STORE I THEN COMPARE MY INFORMATION TO THE THINGS I FIND ON THE INTERNET SATELLITE IMAGES
NathalieMiebach_2011G@85.95:102.81 WEATHER DATA FROM WEATHER STATIONS AS WELL AS OFFSHORE BUOYS THAT 'S BOTH HISTORICAL AS WELL AS REAL DATA AND THEN I COMPILE ALL OF THESE NUMBERS ON THESE CLIPBOARDS THAT YOU SEE HERE THESE CLIPBOARDS ARE FILLED WITH NUMBERS AND FROM ALL OF THESE NUMBERS I START WITH ONLY TWO OR THREE VARIABLES THAT BEGINS MY TRANSLATION PROCESS
NathalieMiebach_2011G@102.81:109.27 MY TRANSLATION MEDIUM IS A VERY SIMPLE BASKET A BASKET IS MADE UP OF HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL ELEMENTS
NathalieMiebach_2011G@109.27:117.99 WHEN I ASSIGN VALUES TO THE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL ELEMENTS I CAN USE THE CHANGES OF THOSE DATA POINTS OVER TIME TO CREATE THE FORM
NathalieMiebach_2011G@117.99:127.42 I USE NATURAL REED BECAUSE NATURAL REED HAS A LOT OF TENSION IN IT THAT I CANNOT FULLY CONTROL THAT MEANS THAT IT IS THE NUMBERS THAT CONTROL THE FORM NOT ME
NathalieMiebach_2011G@127.42:145.57 WHAT I COME UP WITH ARE FORMS LIKE THESE THESE FORMS ARE COMPLETELY MADE UP OF WEATHER DATA OR SCIENCE DATA EVERY COLORED BEAD EVERY COLORED STRING REPRESENTS A WEATHER ELEMENT AND TOGETHER THESE ELEMENTS NOT ONLY CONSTRUCT THE FORM BUT THEY ALSO REVEAL BEHAVIORAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT MAY NOT COME ACROSS THROUGH A TWO DIMENSIONAL GRAPH
NathalieMiebach_2011G@145.57:165 WHEN YOU STEP CLOSER YOU ACTUALLY SEE THAT IT IS INDEED ALL MADE UP OF NUMBERS THE VERTICAL ELEMENTS ARE ASSIGNED A SPECIFIC HOUR OF THE DAY SO ALL THE WAY AROUND YOU HAVE A TWENTY FOUR HOUR TIMELINE BUT IT 'S ALSO USED TO ASSIGN A TEMPERATURE RANGE ON THAT GRID I CAN THEN WEAVE THE HIGH TIDE READINGS WATER TEMPERATURE AIR TEMPERATURE AND MOON PHASES
NathalieMiebach_2011G@165:183.37 I ALSO TRANSLATE WEATHER DATA INTO MUSICAL SCORES AND MUSICAL NOTATION ALLOWS ME A MORE NUANCED WAY OF TRANSLATING INFORMATION WITHOUT COMPROMISING IT SO ALL OF THESE SCORES ARE MADE UP OF WEATHER DATA EVERY SINGLE COLOR DOT EVERY SINGLE LINE IS A WEATHER ELEMENT AND TOGETHER THESE VARIABLES CONSTRUCT A SCORE
NathalieMiebach_2011G@183.37:191.34 I USE THESE SCORES TO COLLABORATE WITH MUSICIANS THIS IS THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN TRIO PERFORMING ONE OF MY PIECES AT THE MILWAUKEE ART MUSEUM
NathalieMiebach_2011G@209.36:215.78 WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS WORK IS THAT IT CHALLENGES OUR ASSUMPTIONS OF WHAT KIND OF VISUAL VOCABULARY BELONGS IN THE WORLD OF ART VERSUS SCIENCE
