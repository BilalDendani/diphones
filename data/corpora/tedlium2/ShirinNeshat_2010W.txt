ShirinNeshat_2010W@16.12:19.43 I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY IS MY CHALLENGE
ShirinNeshat_2010W@19.55:21.15 AS AN IRANIAN ARTIST
ShirinNeshat_2010W@21.5:23.63 AS AN IRANIAN WOMAN ARTIST
ShirinNeshat_2010W@23.83:27.03 AS AN IRANIAN WOMAN ARTIST LIVING IN EXILE
ShirinNeshat_2010W@53.92:55.75 IF YOU 'RE LIVING OUTSIDE LIKE ME
ShirinNeshat_2010W@68.23:73.82 PSYCHOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL SPACE TO DISTANCE OURSELVES FROM THE REALITY
ShirinNeshat_2010W@81.08:91.35 HERSELF ALSO IN THE POSITION OF BEING THE VOICE THE SPEAKER OF MY PEOPLE EVEN IF I HAVE INDEED NO ACCESS TO MY OWN COUNTRY
ShirinNeshat_2010W@112.44:115.3 WE ARE THERE TO TAKE PRIDE AND INSIST
ShirinNeshat_2010W@124.29:125.95 OUR ATROCIOUS GOVERNMENT
ShirinNeshat_2010W@147.57:154.05 BECAUSE WE ARE CONSIDERED AS ARTISTS CENTRAL TO THE CULTURAL POLITICAL SOCIAL DISCOURSE IN IRAN
ShirinNeshat_2010W@154.14:156.06 WE ARE THERE TO INSPIRE
ShirinNeshat_2010W@156.18:159.09 TO PROVOKE TO MOBILIZE
ShirinNeshat_2010W@159.56:161.15 TO BRING HOPE
ShirinNeshat_2010W@168.21:170.09 ART IS OUR WEAPON
ShirinNeshat_2010W@171.59:174.45 CULTURE IS A FORM OF RESISTANCE
ShirinNeshat_2010W@175:177.49 I ENVY SOMETIMES THE ARTISTS OF THE WEST
ShirinNeshat_2010W@178.02:179.79 FOR THEIR FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
ShirinNeshat_2010W@180.11:183.89 FOR THE FACT THAT THEY CAN DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THE QUESTION OF POLITICS
ShirinNeshat_2010W@190.14:192.47 BUT ALSO I WORRY ABOUT THE WEST
ShirinNeshat_2010W@206.12:209.15 AND CULTURE IS BEYOND COMMUNICATION
ShirinNeshat_2010W@210.8:215.56 MY JOURNEY AS AN ARTIST STARTED FROM A VERY VERY PERSONAL PLACE
ShirinNeshat_2010W@215.69:220.69 I DID NOT START TO MAKE SOCIAL COMMENTARY ABOUT MY COUNTRY
ShirinNeshat_2010W@262.43:269.53 I WAS FACING MY OWN PERSONAL DILEMMAS AND QUESTIONS I BECAME IMMERSED IN THE STUDY OF THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION
ShirinNeshat_2010W@284.12:302.82 THE POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION SO IN A WAY BY STUDYING A WOMAN YOU CAN READ THE STRUCTURE AND THE IDEOLOGY OF THE COUNTRY SO I MADE A GROUP OF WORK THAT AT ONCE FACED MY OWN PERSONAL QUESTIONS IN LIFE AND YET IT BROUGHT MY WORK INTO A LARGER DISCOURSE THE SUBJECT
ShirinNeshat_2010W@309.14:313.69 OF LOVE OF GOD FAITH BUT VIOLENCE AND CRIME AND CRUELTY
ShirinNeshat_2010W@329.19:333.39 OF THE GOVERNMENT OR THE IDEOLOGY OF THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION
ShirinNeshat_2010W@346.85:350.01 AND I FELL INTO A LIFE IN EXILE
ShirinNeshat_2010W@401.23:416.52 WHO ARE ALL LOOKING FOR AN IDEA OF CHANGE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY WHILE THE COUNTRY OF IRAN EQUALLY AS IF ANOTHER CHARACTER ALSO STRUGGLED FOR AN IDEA OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY AND INDEPENDENCE FROM THE FOREIGN INTERVENTIONS
ShirinNeshat_2010W@422.29:425.03 ABOUT OUR HISTORY AS A COUNTRY
ShirinNeshat_2010W@436.55:439.57 BY THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT
ShirinNeshat_2010W@453.06:455.24 IN THE WAY WE HAD INTELLECTUAL LIFE
ShirinNeshat_2010W@456.96:460.46 AND MOST OF ALL IN THE WAY THAT WE FOUGHT FOR DEMOCRACY
ShirinNeshat_2010W@461.31:463.76 THESE ARE SOME OF THE SHOTS ACTUALLY FROM MY FILM
ShirinNeshat_2010W@505.71:509.81 THESE ARE SOME OF THE IMAGES AND THE CHARACTERS OF THE FILM
ShirinNeshat_2010W@530.37:532.66 WHAT IS UNBELIEVABLY IRONIC
ShirinNeshat_2010W@593.76:598.87 I THEN DISCOVERED WHY I TAKE SO MUCH INSPIRATION FROM IRANIAN WOMEN
ShirinNeshat_2010W@611.76:616.3 I STAND HERE TO SAY THAT IRANIAN WOMEN HAVE FOUND A NEW VOICE
ShirinNeshat_2010W@616.92:619.95 AND THEIR VOICE IS GIVING ME MY VOICE
