HansRosling_2010S@29.42:33.36 I'M GOING TO TALK NOW ABOUT HOW WORLD POPULATION HAS CHANGED FROM THAT
HansRosling_2010S@33.57:35.09 YEAR AND INTO THE FUTURE
HansRosling_2010S@35.81:42.56 BUT I WILL NOT USE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AS I'VE DONE DURING MY FIRST FIVE TEDTALKS INSTEAD I
HansRosling_2010S@43.90:55.19 AND I AM TODAY LAUNCHING A BRAND NEW ANALOG TEACHING TECHNOLOGY THAT I PICKED UP FROM IKEA THIS BOX THIS BOX CONTAINS ONE BILLION PEOPLE
HansRosling_2010S@67.25:75.17 AND THEY LIVED AWAY THEN THERE WAS A BIG GAP BETWEEN THE ONE BILLION IN THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD AND THE TWO BILLION IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD
HansRosling_2010S@77.93:79.60 PEOPLE WERE HEALTHY
HansRosling_2010S@93.44:96.22 THIS WAS THE ECONOMIC LEVEL AT WHICH SWEDEN WAS
HansRosling_2010S@96.65:100.65 BUT IN CONTRAST TO THIS IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD FAR AWAY
HansRosling_2010S@101.01:105.58 THE ASPIRATION OF THE AVERAGE FAMILY THERE WAS TO HAVE FOOD FOR THE DAY
HansRosling_2010S@106.24:107.53 AND THEY WERE SAVING
HansRosling_2010S@108.01:109.98 TO BE ABLE TO BUY A PAIR OF SHOES
HansRosling_2010S@111.36:114.32 THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS GAP IN THE WORLD WHEN I GREW UP
HansRosling_2010S@115.22:126.63 AND THIS GAP BETWEEN THE WEST AND THE REST HAS CREATED A MINDSET OF THE WORLD WHICH WE STILL USE LINGUISTICALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE WEST AND THE DEVELOPING WORLD
HansRosling_2010S@127.79:133.22 BUT THE WORLD HAS CHANGED AND IT'S OVERDUE TO UPGRADE THAT MINDSET AND THAT
HansRosling_2010S@141.95:151.25 UP TO TWO THOUSAND AND TEN IS THAT A STAGGERING FOUR BILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE WORLD POPULATION JUST LOOK HOW MANY
HansRosling_2010S@151.80:153.20 THE WORLD POPULATION HAS
HansRosling_2010S@154.35:155.59 SINCE I WENT TO SCHOOL
HansRosling_2010S@157.32:159.20 AND OF COURSE THERE'S BEEN ECONOMIC GROWTH
HansRosling_2010S@164.07:173.36 SO THE WESTERN POPULATION MOVED OVER TO HERE AND NOW THEIR ASPIRATION IS NOT ONLY TO HAVE A CAR NOW THEY WANT TO HAVE A HOLIDAY ON A VERY REMOTE DESTINATION AND THEY WANT TO FLY
HansRosling_2010S@175.12:185.83 SO THIS IS WHERE THEY ARE TODAY AND THE MOST SUCCESSFUL OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES THEY HAVE MOVED ON YOU KNOW AND THEY HAVE BECOME EMERGING ECONOMIES WE CALL THEM AND THEY ARE NOW BUYING CARS
HansRosling_2010S@187.33:196.98 HAPPENED A MONTH AGO WAS THAT THE CHINESE COMPANY GEELY THEY ACQUIRED THE VOLVO COMPANY AND THEN FINALLY THE SWEDES UNDERSTOOD THAT SOMETHING BIG HAD HAPPENED IN THE WORLD
HansRosling_2010S@202.43:205.15 AND THE TRAGEDY IS THAT THE TWO BILLION OVER HERE
HansRosling_2010S@207.10:211.87 FOR FOOD AND SHOES THEY ARE STILL ALMOST AS POOR AS THEY WERE FIFTY YEARS AGO
HansRosling_2010S@212.93:219.46 THE NEW THING IS THAT WE HAVE THE BIGGEST PILE OF BILLIONS THE THREE BILLIONS HERE WHICH ARE ALSO BECOMING EMERGING
HansRosling_2010S@220.81:226.88 BECAUSE THEY ARE QUITE HEALTHY RELATIVELY WELL EDUCATED AND THEY ALREADY ALSO HAVE TWO OR THREE CHILDREN PER WOMAN
HansRosling_2010S@229.54:232.75 ASPIRATION NOW IS OF COURSE TO BUY A BICYCLE
HansRosling_2010S@233.40:235.84 AND THEN LATER ON THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A MOTORBIKE
HansRosling_2010S@237.32:240.59 BUT THIS IS THE WORLD WE HAVE TODAY
HansRosling_2010S@241.14:242.31 NO LONGER ANY GAP
HansRosling_2010S@243.41:249.53 THE DISTANCE FROM THE POOREST HERE THE VERY POOREST TO THE VERY RICHEST OVER HERE IS WIDER THAN EVER
HansRosling_2010S@249.98:255.00 BUT THERE IS A CONTINUOUS WORLD FROM WALKING BIKING DRIVING TO
HansRosling_2010S@261.82:264.86 THIS IS THE NEW WORLD WE HAVE TODAY IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN
HansRosling_2010S@271.32:273.64 I'M GOING TO PROJECT INTO TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTY
HansRosling_2010S@274.97:276.61 I WAS IN SHANGHAI RECENTLY
HansRosling_2010S@277.35:282.14 AND I LISTENED TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CHINA AND IT'S PRETTY SURE THAT THEY WILL CATCH UP
HansRosling_2010S@305.13:315.46 WE INVEST IN THE RIGHT GREEN TECHNOLOGY SO THAT WE CAN AVOID SEVERE CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY CAN STILL BE RELATIVELY CHEAP THEN THEY WILL MOVE ALL THE WAY
HansRosling_2010S@316.36:319.45 AND THEY WILL START TO BUY ELECTRIC CARS
HansRosling_2010S@320.67:322.31 THIS IS WHAT WE WILL FIND
HansRosling_2010S@323.08:324.94 SO WHAT ABOUT THE POOREST TWO BILLION
HansRosling_2010S@325.51:327.05 WHAT ABOUT THE POOREST TWO BILLION
HansRosling_2010S@329.01:330.02 THEY MOVE ON
HansRosling_2010S@331.05:337.23 HERE POPULATION COMES IN BECAUSE THERE WE ALREADY HAVE TWO TO THREE CHILDREN PER WOMAN FAMILY PLANNING IS WIDELY USED
HansRosling_2010S@342.36:347.27 SO THESE TWO BILLION WILL IN THE NEXT DECADES INCREASE TO THREE BILLION
HansRosling_2010S@347.89:348.51 AND THEY
HansRosling_2010S@350.51:355.11 FOUR BILLION THERE IS NOTHING BUT A NUCLEAR WAR
HansRosling_2010S@355.45:357.95 OF A KIND WE'VE NEVER SEEN THAT CAN STOP THIS FROM
HansRosling_2010S@359.33:360.40 BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE
HansRosling_2010S@363.52:375.41 AND ONLY IF GET OUT OF POVERTY THEY GET EDUCATION THEY GET IMPROVED CHILD SURVIVAL THEY CAN BUY A BICYCLE AND A CELLPHONE AND COME HERE THEN POPULATION GROWTH WILL STOP IN TWO THOUSAND AND
HansRosling_2010S@376.20:383.42 WE CANNOT HAVE PEOPLE ON THIS LEVEL LOOKING FOR FOOD AND SHOES BECAUSE THEN WE GET CONTINUED POPULATION GROWTH
HansRosling_2010S@383.89:387.97 AND LET ME SHOW YOU WHY BY CONVERTING BACK TO THE OLD TIME
HansRosling_2010S@400.49:409.01 DARK BLUE IS AFRICA BROWN IS EUROPE GREEN IS THE MIDDLE EAST AND THIS LIGHT BLUE IS SOUTH ASIA THAT'S INDIA AND THIS IS CHINA
HansRosling_2010S@421.13:428.12 THE PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN SURVIVING CHILDHOOD UP TO STARTING SCHOOL SIXTY PERCENT SEVENTY PERCENT EIGHTY PERCENT NINETY
HansRosling_2010S@439.26:448.40 CHILD SURVIVAL SMALL FAMILIES AND ALL THE REST THE RAINBOW OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WITH VERY LARGE FAMILIES AND POOR CHILD
HansRosling_2010S@449.96:461.01 WHAT HAS HAPPENED I START THE WORLD HERE WE GO CAN YOU SEE AS THE YEARS PASS BY CHILD SURVIVAL IS INCREASING THEY GET SOAP HYGIENE EDUCATION VACCINATION AND PENICILLIN AND THEN FAMILY PLANNING
HansRosling_2010S@462.30:471.58 THEY GET UP TO NINETY PERCENT CHILD SURVIVAL THEN FAMILIES DECREASE AND MOST OF THE ARAB COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS FALLING DOWN THERE LOOK BANGLADESH CATCHING UP WITH INDIA
HansRosling_2010S@474.13:486.49 WORLD JOINS THE WESTERN WORLD WITH GOOD CHILD SURVIVAL AND SMALL FAMILY SIZE BUT WE STILL HAVE THE POOREST BILLION CAN YOU SEE THE POOREST BILLION THOSE BOXES I HAD OVER HERE
HansRosling_2010S@487.92:495.50 THEY ARE STILL UP HERE AND THEY STILL HAVE A CHILD SURVIVAL OF ONLY SEVENTY TO EIGHTY PERCENT MEANING THAT IF YOU HAVE SIX CHILDREN
HansRosling_2010S@521.07:531.07 ACTUALLY HELPING US TO REACH A SUSTAINABLE POPULATION SIZE OF THE WORLD WE CAN STOP AT NINE BILLION IF WE DO THE RIGHT THINGS CHILD SURVIVAL IS THE NEW GREEN
HansRosling_2010S@531.76:535.02 IT'S ONLY BY CHILD SURVIVAL THAT WE WILL STOP POPULATION GROWTH
HansRosling_2010S@539.19:540.32 I'M NOT AN OPTIMIST
HansRosling_2010S@541.54:542.65 NEITHER AM I A
HansRosling_2010S@543.36:552.97 A VERY SERIOUS POSSIBILIST IT'S A NEW CATEGORY WHERE WE TAKE EMOTION APART AND WE JUST WORK ANALYTICALLY WITH THE WORLD IT CAN BE
HansRosling_2010S@565.09:567.82 AND LOOK AT THE POSITION OF THE OLD WEST
HansRosling_2010S@569.77:572.96 BOX WAS ALL ALONE LEADING THE WORLD LIVING ITS OWN LIFE
HansRosling_2010S@576.25:581.85 THE ROLE OF THE OLD WEST IN THE NEW WORLD IS TO BECOME THE FOUNDATION OF THE
HansRosling_2010S@583.41:585.27 NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS
