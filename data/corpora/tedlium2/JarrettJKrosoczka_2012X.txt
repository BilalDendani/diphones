JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X MY NAME IS JARRETT KROSOCZKA AND I WRITE AND ILLUSTRATE BOOKS FOR CHILDREN
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X BUT WELL BEFORE MY IMAGINATION WAS MY VOCATION
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X MY IMAGINATION SAVED MY LIFE
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X WHEN I WAS A KID I LOVED TO DRAW AND THE MOST TALENTED ARTIST I KNEW
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X WAS MY MOTHER
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X AND WHEN YOUR PARENT IS A DRUG ADDICT IT 'S KIND OF LIKE CHARLIE BROWN TRYING TO KICK THE FOOTBALL BECAUSE AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO LOVE ON THAT PERSON AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO RECEIVE LOVE FROM THAT PERSON EVERY TIME YOU OPEN YOUR HEART YOU END UP ON YOUR BACK
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X SO THROUGHOUT MY CHILDHOOD MY MOTHER WAS INCARCERATED AND I DIDN 'T HAVE MY FATHER BECAUSE I DIDN 'T EVEN LEARN HIS FIRST NAME UNTIL I WAS IN THE SIXTH GRADE
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X BUT I HAD MY GRANDPARENTS MY MATERNAL GRANDPARENTS JOSEPH AND SHIRLEY WHO ADOPTED ME JUST BEFORE MY THIRD BIRTHDAY AND TOOK ME IN AS THEIR OWN AFTER THEY HAD ALREADY RAISED FIVE CHILDREN SO TWO PEOPLE WHO GREW UP IN THE GREAT DEPRESSION
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X THERE IN THE VERY VERY EARLY EIGHTY S TOOK ON A NEW KID I WAS THE COUSIN OLIVER OF THE SITCOM OF THE KROSOCZKA FAMILY THE NEW KID WHO CAME OUT OF NOWHERE
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT LIFE WAS TOTALLY EASY WITH THEM THEY EACH SMOKED TWO PACKS A DAY EACH NONFILTERED AND BY THE TIME I WAS SIX I COULD ORDER A SOUTHERN COMFORT MANHATTAN DRY WITH A TWIST ROCKS ON THE SIDE THE ICE ON THE SIDE SO YOU COULD FIT MORE LIQUOR IN THE DRINK
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X BUT THEY LOVED THE HELL OUT OF ME THEY LOVED ME SO MUCH
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X AND THEY SUPPORTED MY CREATIVE EFFORTS BECAUSE MY GRANDFATHER WAS A SELF MADE MAN HE RAN AND WORKED IN A FACTORY MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A HOMEMAKER
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X BUT HERE WAS THIS KID WHO LOVED TRANSFORMERS AND SNOOPY AND THE NINJA TURTLES AND THE CHARACTERS THAT I READ ABOUT I FELL IN LOVE WITH
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X AND THEY BECAME MY FRIENDS SO MY BEST FRIENDS IN LIFE WERE THE CHARACTERS I READ ABOUT IN BOOKS
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X I WENT TO GATES LANE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN WORCESTER MASSACHUSETTS AND I HAD WONDERFUL TEACHERS THERE
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X MOST NOTABLY IN FIRST GRADE MRS ALISCH
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X AND I JUST I CAN JUST REMEMBER THE LOVE THAT SHE OFFERED US AS HER STUDENTS WHEN I WAS IN THE THIRD GRADE
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X AND AFTERWARDS WE ALL WENT BACK TO OUR CLASSROOMS AND WE DREW OUR OWN RENDITIONS OF HIS MAIN CHARACTER ROTTEN RALPH
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X AND SUDDENLY THE AUTHOR APPEARED IN OUR DOORWAY
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X TWO WORDS THAT MADE A COLOSSAL DIFFERENCE IN MY LIFE
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X WHEN I WAS IN THE THIRD GRADE I WROTE A BOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME THE OWL WHO THOUGHT HE WAS THE BEST FLYER
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X OUR OWN CREATION STORY SO I WROTE A STORY ABOUT AN OWL WHO CHALLENGED HERMES TO A FLYING RACE AND THE OWL CHEATED
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X AND HERMES BEING A GREEK GOD GREW ANGRY AND BITTER AND TURNED THE OWL INTO A MOON SO THE OWL HAD TO LIVE THE REST OF HIS LIFE AS A MOON WHILE HE WATCHED HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS PLAY AT NIGHT
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X I WAS CLEARLY WORRIED ABOUT MY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X IT WAS A STORY THAT WAS TOLD WITH WORDS AND PICTURES EXACTLY WHAT I DO NOW FOR A LIVING AND I SOMETIMES LET THE WORDS HAVE THE STAGE ON THEIR OWN
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X USING MY IMAGINATION AND THAT 'S WHAT WRITING IS WRITING IS USING YOUR IMAGINATION ON PAPER AND I DO GET SO SCARED BECAUSE I TRAVEL TO SO MANY SCHOOLS NOW AND THAT SEEMS LIKE SUCH A FOREIGN CONCEPT TO KIDS THAT WRITING WOULD BE USING YOUR IMAGINATION ON PAPER IF THEY 'RE ALLOWED TO EVEN WRITE NOW WITHIN THE SCHOOL HOURS
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X SO I LOVED WRITING SO MUCH THAT I 'D COME HOME FROM SCHOOL
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X AND I WOULD TAKE OUT PIECES OF PAPER AND I WOULD STAPLE THEM TOGETHER AND I WOULD FILL THOSE BLANK PAGES WITH WORDS AND PICTURES JUST BECAUSE I LOVED USING MY IMAGINATION AND SO THESE CHARACTERS WOULD BECOME MY FRIENDS THERE WAS AN EGG A TOMATO A HEAD OF LETTUCE AND A PUMPKIN
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X AND THEY ALL LIVED IN THIS REFRIGERATOR CITY
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X AND IN ONE OF THEIR ADVENTURES THEY WENT TO A HAUNTED HOUSE THAT WAS FILLED WITH SO MANY DANGERS LIKE AN EVIL BLENDER
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X AND THROUGH PICTURES NOW WHEN I WAS IN SIXTH GRADE THE PUBLIC FUNDING ALL BUT ELIMINATED THE ARTS BUDGETS IN THE WORCESTER PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X I WENT FROM HAVING ART ONCE A WEEK TO TWICE A MONTH TO ONCE A MONTH TO NOT AT ALL
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X I HAD ART
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X SO HE WALKED INTO MY ROOM ONE EVENING AND HE SAT ON THE EDGE OF MY BED AND HE SAID JARRETT IT 'S UP TO YOU BUT IF YOU 'D LIKE TO WE 'D LIKE TO SEND YOU TO THE CLASSES AT THE WORCESTER ART MUSEUM AND I WAS SO THRILLED
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X SO FROM SIXTH THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE ONCE TWICE SOMETIMES THREE TIMES A WEEK I WOULD TAKE CLASSES AT THE ART MUSEUM AND I WAS SURROUNDED BY OTHER KIDS WHO LOVED TO DRAW OTHER KIDS WHO SHARED A SIMILAR PASSION
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X NOW MY PUBLISHING CAREER BEGAN WHEN I DESIGNED THE COVER FOR MY EIGHTH GRADE YEARBOOK
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X AND IF YOU 'RE WONDERING ABOUT THE STYLE OF DRESS I PUT OUR MASCOT IN I WAS REALLY INTO BELL BIV DEVOE AND MC HAMMER AND VANILLA ICE AT THE TIME
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X AND TO THIS DAY I STILL CAN DO KARAOKE TO ICE ICE BABY WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE SCREEN
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X DON 'T TEMPT ME BECAUSE I WILL DO IT
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X SO I GET SHIPPED OFF TO PRIVATE SCHOOL K THROUGH EIGHT PUBLIC SCHOOLS BUT FOR SOME REASON MY GRANDFATHER WAS UPSET THAT SOMEBODY AT THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL HAD BEEN STABBED AND KILLED
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X SO HE DIDN 'T WANT ME TO GO THERE
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X HE WANTED ME TO GO TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL AND HE GAVE ME AN OPTION
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X YOU CAN GO TO HOLY NAME WHICH IS COED OR ST JOHN 'S WHICH IS ALL BOYS
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X VERY WISE MAN BECAUSE HE KNEW I WOULD I FELT LIKE I WAS MAKING THE DECISION ON MY OWN AND HE KNEW I WOULDN 'T CHOOSE ST JOHN 'S SO I WENT TO HOLY NAME HIGH SCHOOL WHICH WAS A TOUGH TRANSITION BECAUSE LIKE I SAID I DIDN 'T PLAY SPORTS AND IT WAS VERY FOCUSED ON SPORTS BUT I TOOK SOLACE IN MR SHILALE 'S ART
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X I JUST COULDN 'T WAIT TO GET TO THAT CLASSROOM EVERY DAY
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X SO HOW DID I MAKE FRIENDS I DREW FUNNY PICTURES OF MY TEACHERS
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X WELL
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X IN ENGLISH CLASS IN NINTH GRADE MY FRIEND JOHN WHO WAS SITTING NEXT TO ME LAUGHED A LITTLE BIT TOO HARD
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X MR GREENWOOD WAS NOT PLEASED
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X I WAS SENT TO THE HALL AND I THOUGHT OH NO I 'M DOOMED MY GRANDFATHER 'S JUST GOING TO KILL ME AND HE CAME OUT TO THE HALLWAY AND HE SAID LET ME SEE THE PAPER AND I THOUGHT OH NO HE THINKS IT 'S A NOTE AND SO I TOOK THIS PICTURE AND I HANDED IT TO HIM
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X AND HE SAID TO ME YOU 'RE REALLY TALENTED
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X YOU 'RE REALLY GOOD YOU KNOW THE SCHOOL NEWSPAPER NEEDS A NEW CARTOONIST AND YOU SHOULD BE THE CARTOONIST JUST STOP DRAWING IN MY CLASS
