JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@16.11:21.39 MY NAME IS JARRETT KROSOCZKA AND I WRITE AND ILLUSTRATE BOOKS FOR CHILDREN
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@27.05:30.27 BUT WELL BEFORE MY IMAGINATION WAS MY VOCATION
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@30.67:32.44 MY IMAGINATION SAVED MY LIFE
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@33.3:37.92 WHEN I WAS A KID I LOVED TO DRAW AND THE MOST TALENTED ARTIST I KNEW
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@37.92:39.96 WAS MY MOTHER
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@43.81:57.93 AND WHEN YOUR PARENT IS A DRUG ADDICT IT 'S KIND OF LIKE CHARLIE BROWN TRYING TO KICK THE FOOTBALL BECAUSE AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO LOVE ON THAT PERSON AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO RECEIVE LOVE FROM THAT PERSON EVERY TIME YOU OPEN YOUR HEART YOU END UP ON YOUR BACK
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@58.43:67.43 SO THROUGHOUT MY CHILDHOOD MY MOTHER WAS INCARCERATED AND I DIDN 'T HAVE MY FATHER BECAUSE I DIDN 'T EVEN LEARN HIS FIRST NAME UNTIL I WAS IN THE SIXTH GRADE
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@68.21:82.57 BUT I HAD MY GRANDPARENTS MY MATERNAL GRANDPARENTS JOSEPH AND SHIRLEY WHO ADOPTED ME JUST BEFORE MY THIRD BIRTHDAY AND TOOK ME IN AS THEIR OWN AFTER THEY HAD ALREADY RAISED FIVE CHILDREN SO TWO PEOPLE WHO GREW UP IN THE GREAT DEPRESSION
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@82.57:94.38 THERE IN THE VERY VERY EARLY EIGHTY S TOOK ON A NEW KID I WAS THE COUSIN OLIVER OF THE SITCOM OF THE KROSOCZKA FAMILY THE NEW KID WHO CAME OUT OF NOWHERE
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@94.42:110.68 AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT LIFE WAS TOTALLY EASY WITH THEM THEY EACH SMOKED TWO PACKS A DAY EACH NONFILTERED AND BY THE TIME I WAS SIX I COULD ORDER A SOUTHERN COMFORT MANHATTAN DRY WITH A TWIST ROCKS ON THE SIDE THE ICE ON THE SIDE SO YOU COULD FIT MORE LIQUOR IN THE DRINK
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@111.72:115.12 BUT THEY LOVED THE HELL OUT OF ME THEY LOVED ME SO MUCH
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@115.13:124.76 AND THEY SUPPORTED MY CREATIVE EFFORTS BECAUSE MY GRANDFATHER WAS A SELF MADE MAN HE RAN AND WORKED IN A FACTORY MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A HOMEMAKER
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@124.76:135.49 BUT HERE WAS THIS KID WHO LOVED TRANSFORMERS AND SNOOPY AND THE NINJA TURTLES AND THE CHARACTERS THAT I READ ABOUT I FELL IN LOVE WITH
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@135.74:143.12 AND THEY BECAME MY FRIENDS SO MY BEST FRIENDS IN LIFE WERE THE CHARACTERS I READ ABOUT IN BOOKS
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@144.02:149.22 I WENT TO GATES LANE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN WORCESTER MASSACHUSETTS AND I HAD WONDERFUL TEACHERS THERE
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@149.41:152.26 MOST NOTABLY IN FIRST GRADE MRS ALISCH
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@152.76:162.17 AND I JUST I CAN JUST REMEMBER THE LOVE THAT SHE OFFERED US AS HER STUDENTS WHEN I WAS IN THE THIRD GRADE
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@172.2:179.3 AND AFTERWARDS WE ALL WENT BACK TO OUR CLASSROOMS AND WE DREW OUR OWN RENDITIONS OF HIS MAIN CHARACTER ROTTEN RALPH
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@179.62:182.07 AND SUDDENLY THE AUTHOR APPEARED IN OUR DOORWAY
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@199.73:204.11 TWO WORDS THAT MADE A COLOSSAL DIFFERENCE IN MY LIFE
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@204.75:210.54 WHEN I WAS IN THE THIRD GRADE I WROTE A BOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME THE OWL WHO THOUGHT HE WAS THE BEST FLYER
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@214.28:222.98 OUR OWN CREATION STORY SO I WROTE A STORY ABOUT AN OWL WHO CHALLENGED HERMES TO A FLYING RACE AND THE OWL CHEATED
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@222.99:233 AND HERMES BEING A GREEK GOD GREW ANGRY AND BITTER AND TURNED THE OWL INTO A MOON SO THE OWL HAD TO LIVE THE REST OF HIS LIFE AS A MOON WHILE HE WATCHED HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS PLAY AT NIGHT
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@239.31:241.63 I WAS CLEARLY WORRIED ABOUT MY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@246.69:255.01 IT WAS A STORY THAT WAS TOLD WITH WORDS AND PICTURES EXACTLY WHAT I DO NOW FOR A LIVING AND I SOMETIMES LET THE WORDS HAVE THE STAGE ON THEIR OWN
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@278.67:297.39 USING MY IMAGINATION AND THAT 'S WHAT WRITING IS WRITING IS USING YOUR IMAGINATION ON PAPER AND I DO GET SO SCARED BECAUSE I TRAVEL TO SO MANY SCHOOLS NOW AND THAT SEEMS LIKE SUCH A FOREIGN CONCEPT TO KIDS THAT WRITING WOULD BE USING YOUR IMAGINATION ON PAPER IF THEY 'RE ALLOWED TO EVEN WRITE NOW WITHIN THE SCHOOL HOURS
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@297.39:300.11 SO I LOVED WRITING SO MUCH THAT I 'D COME HOME FROM SCHOOL
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@300.23:315.73 AND I WOULD TAKE OUT PIECES OF PAPER AND I WOULD STAPLE THEM TOGETHER AND I WOULD FILL THOSE BLANK PAGES WITH WORDS AND PICTURES JUST BECAUSE I LOVED USING MY IMAGINATION AND SO THESE CHARACTERS WOULD BECOME MY FRIENDS THERE WAS AN EGG A TOMATO A HEAD OF LETTUCE AND A PUMPKIN
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@315.73:318.43 AND THEY ALL LIVED IN THIS REFRIGERATOR CITY
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@318.72:324.25 AND IN ONE OF THEIR ADVENTURES THEY WENT TO A HAUNTED HOUSE THAT WAS FILLED WITH SO MANY DANGERS LIKE AN EVIL BLENDER
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@344.2:352.75 AND THROUGH PICTURES NOW WHEN I WAS IN SIXTH GRADE THE PUBLIC FUNDING ALL BUT ELIMINATED THE ARTS BUDGETS IN THE WORCESTER PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM

JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@381.54:392.25 SO FROM SIXTH THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE ONCE TWICE SOMETIMES THREE TIMES A WEEK I WOULD TAKE CLASSES AT THE ART MUSEUM AND I WAS SURROUNDED BY OTHER KIDS WHO LOVED TO DRAW OTHER KIDS WHO SHARED A SIMILAR PASSION
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@392.25:398.63 NOW MY PUBLISHING CAREER BEGAN WHEN I DESIGNED THE COVER FOR MY EIGHTH GRADE YEARBOOK

JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@426.98:429.29 SO HE DIDN 'T WANT ME TO GO THERE
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@429.77:432.79 HE WANTED ME TO GO TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL AND HE GAVE ME AN OPTION
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@432.79:436.71 YOU CAN GO TO HOLY NAME WHICH IS COED OR ST JOHN 'S WHICH IS ALL BOYS
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X@436.71:454.7 VERY WISE MAN BECAUSE HE KNEW I WOULD I FELT LIKE I WAS MAKING THE DECISION ON MY OWN AND HE KNEW I WOULDN 'T CHOOSE ST JOHN 'S SO I WENT TO HOLY NAME HIGH SCHOOL WHICH WAS A TOUGH TRANSITION BECAUSE LIKE I SAID I DIDN 'T PLAY SPORTS AND IT WAS VERY FOCUSED ON SPORTS BUT I TOOK SOLACE IN MR SHILALE 'S ART
