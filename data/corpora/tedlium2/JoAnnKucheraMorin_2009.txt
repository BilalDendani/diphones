JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 IF A TEAM OF PHYSICISTS COULD STAND INSIDE OF AN ATOM AND WATCH AND HEAR ELECTRONS SPIN
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 IF A GROUP OF SCULPTORS COULD BE INSIDE OF A LATTICE OF ATOMS AND SCULPT WITH THEIR MATERIAL IMAGINE IF A TEAM OF SURGEONS COULD FLY INTO THE BRAIN AS THOUGH IT WAS A WORLD
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 AND SEE TISSUES AS LANDSCAPES AND HEAR BLOOD DENSITY LEVELS AS MUSIC THIS IS SOME OF THE RESEARCH THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT WE'RE UNDERTAKING AT THE ALLOSPHERE
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 BUT FIRST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS GROUP OF ARTISTS SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS THAT ARE WORKING TOGETHER I'M A COMPOSER ORCHESTRALLY TRAINED AND THE INVENTOR OF THE ALLOSPHERE
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 WITH MY VISUAL ARTIST COLLEAGUES WE MAP COMPLEX MATHEMATICAL ALGORITHMS THAT UNFOLD IN TIME AND SPACE VISUALLY AND SONICALLY
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 OUR SCIENTIST COLLEAGUES ARE FINDING NEW PATTERNS IN THE INFORMATION AND OUR ENGINEERING COLLEAGUES ARE MAKING ONE OF THE LARGEST DYNAMICALLY VARYING COMPUTERS IN THE WORLD FOR THIS KIND OF DATA EXPLORATION
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 I'M GOING TO FLY YOU INTO FIVE RESEARCH PROJECTS IN THE ALLOSPHERE THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU FROM BIOLOGICAL MACROSCOPIC DATA ALL THE WAY
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 DOWN TO ELECTRON SPIN THIS FIRST PROJECT IS CALLED THE ALLOBRAIN AND IT'S OUR ATTEMPT TO QUANTIFY BEAUTY BY FINDING WHICH REGIONS OF THE BRAIN
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 ARE INTERACTIVE WHILE WITNESSING SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL YOU'RE FLYING THROUGH THE CORTEX OF MY COLLEAGUE 'S BRAIN
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 OUR NARRATIVE HERE IS REAL FMRI DATA THAT'S MAPPED VISUALLY AND SONICALLY THE BRAIN NOW A WORLD THAT WE CAN FLY THROUGH AND INTERACT WITH
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 YOU SEE TWELVE INTELLIGENT COMPUTER AGENTS THE LITTLE RECTANGLES THAT ARE FLYING IN THE BRAIN WITH YOU THEY'RE MINING BLOOD DENSITY LEVELS AND THEY'RE REPORTING THEM BACK TO YOU SONICALLY HIGHER
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 HIGHER DENSITIES WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE FROM REAL BIOLOGICAL DATA TO BIOGENERATIVE ALGORITHMS THAT CREATE ARTIFICIAL
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 IN OUR NEXT ARTISTIC AND SCIENTIFIC INSTALLATION
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 IN THIS ARTISTIC AND SCIENTIFIC INSTALLATION BIOGENERATIVE ALGORITHMS ARE HELPING US TO UNDERSTAND SELF GENERATION AND GROWTH VERY IMPORTANT FOR SIMULATION IN THE
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 FOR ARTISTS WE'RE MAKING NEW WORLDS THAT WE CAN UNCOVER AND EXPLORE AS THESE GENERATIVE ALGORITHMS GROW OVER TIME THEY INTERACT AND COMMUNICATE AS A SWARM OF INSECTS
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 OUR RESEARCHERS ARE INTERACTING WITH THIS DATA BY INJECTING BACTERIAL CODE WHICH ARE COMPUTER PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW THESE CREATURES TO GROW OVER TIME
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 WE'RE GOING TO MOVE NOW FROM THE BIOLOGICAL AND THE MACROSCOPIC WORLD DOWN INTO THE ATOMIC WORLD AS WE FLY INTO A LATTICE OF ATOMS THIS IS REAL AFM ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPE
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 DATA FROM MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SOLID STATE LIGHTING AND ENERGY CENTER THEY'VE DISCOVERED A NEW BOND A NEW MATERIAL FOR TRANSPARENT SOLAR CELLS
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 WE'RE FLYING THROUGH TWO THOUSAND LATTICE OF ATOMS OXYGEN HYDROGEN AND ZINC YOU VIEW THE BOND IN THE TRIANGLE
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 IT'S FOUR BLUE ZINC ATOMS BONDING WITH ONE WHITE HYDROGEN ATOM YOU SEE THE ELECTRON FLOW WITH THE STREAMLINES WE AS ARTISTS HAVE GENERATED FOR THE SCIENTISTS
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 THIS IS ALLOWING THEM TO FIND THE BONDING NODES IN ANY LATTICE OF ATOMS WE THINK IT MAKES A BEAUTIFUL STRUCTURAL ART
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 THE SOUND THAT YOU'RE HEARING ARE THE ACTUAL EMISSION SPECTRUMS OF THESE ATOMS WE'VE MAPPED THEM INTO THE AUDIO DOMAIN SO THEY'RE SINGING TO YOU
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 OXYGEN HYDROGEN AND ZINC HAVE THEIR OWN SIGNATURE WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY MOVE EVEN FURTHER DOWN AS WE GO
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 FROM THIS LATTICE OF ATOMS TO ONE SINGLE HYDROGEN ATOM WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR PHYSICIST COLLEAGUES THAT HAVE GIVEN US THE MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS OF THE
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE RIGHT NOW IS A SUPERPOSITION OF AN ELECTRON IN THE LOWER THREE ORBITALS OF A HYDROGEN ATOM YOU'RE ACTUALLY HEARING AND SEEING THE ELECTRON FLOW WITH THE LINES
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 THE WHITE DOTS ARE THE PROBABILITY WAVE THAT WILL SHOW YOU WHERE THE ELECTRON IS IN ANY GIVEN POINT OF TIME AND SPACE IN THIS PARTICULAR THREE ORBITAL CONFIGURATION IN A MINUTE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO A TWO ORBITAL CONFIGURATION
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 AND YOU'RE GOING TO NOTICE A PULSING AND YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR AN UNDULATION BETWEEN THE SOUND THIS IS ACTUALLY A LIGHT EMITTER AS THE SOUND STARTS TO PULSE AND CONTRACT OUR PHYSICISTS CAN TELL WHEN A PHOTON IS GOING TO BE EMITTED
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 THEY'RE STARTING TO FIND NEW MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES IN THESE CALCULATIONS AND THEY'RE UNDERSTANDING MORE ABOUT QUANTUM MATHEMATICS
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 WE'RE GOING TO MOVE EVEN FURTHER DOWN AND GO TO ONE SINGLE ELECTRON SPIN THIS WILL BE THE FINAL PROJECT THAT I SHOW YOU
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE CENTER FOR QUANTUM COMPUTATION AND SPINTRONICS ARE ACTUALLY MEASURING WITH THEIR LASERS DECOHERENCE IN A SINGLE ELECTRON SPIN
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 WE'VE TAKEN THIS INFORMATION AND WE'VE MADE A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OUT OF IT YOU'RE ACTUALLY SEEING AND HEARING QUANTUM INFORMATION FLOW THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE NEXT STEP IN SIMULATING QUANTUM COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 SO THESE BRIEF EXAMPLES THAT I'VE SHOWN YOU GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE KIND OF WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 TO BRING TOGETHER ARTS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING INTO A NEW AGE OF
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009 SCIENCE AND ART WE HOPE THAT ALL OF YOU WILL COME TO SEE THE ALLOSPHERE INSPIRE US TO THINK OF NEW WAYS THAT WE CAN USE THIS UNIQUE INSTRUMENT THAT WE'VE CREATED AT SANTA BARBARA
