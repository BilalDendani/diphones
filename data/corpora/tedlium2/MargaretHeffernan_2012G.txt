MargaretHeffernan_2012G ALICE WAS UNUSUAL PARTLY BECAUSE OF COURSE SHE WAS A WOMAN WHICH WAS PRETTY RARE IN THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY S AND SHE WAS BRILLIANT SHE WAS ONE OF THE AT THE TIME THE YOUNGEST FELLOW TO BE ELECTED TO THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS SHE WAS UNUSUAL TOO BECAUSE SHE CONTINUED TO WORK AFTER SHE GOT MARRIED AFTER SHE HAD KIDS
MargaretHeffernan_2012G AND EVEN AFTER SHE GOT DIVORCED AND WAS A SINGLE PARENT SHE CONTINUED HER MEDICAL WORK AND SHE WAS UNUSUAL BECAUSE SHE WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN A NEW SCIENCE THE EMERGING FIELD OF EPIDEMIOLOGY THE STUDY OF PATTERNS IN DISEASE
MargaretHeffernan_2012G BUT LIKE EVERY SCIENTIST SHE APPRECIATED THAT TO MAKE HER MARK WHAT SHE NEEDED TO DO WAS FIND A HARD PROBLEM
MargaretHeffernan_2012G AND SOLVE IT
MargaretHeffernan_2012G THE HARD PROBLEM THAT ALICE CHOSE WAS THE RISING INCIDENCE OF CHILDHOOD CANCERS MOST DISEASE IS CORRELATED WITH POVERTY BUT IN THE CASE OF CHILDHOOD CANCERS THE CHILDREN WHO WERE DYING SEEMED MOSTLY TO COME FROM
MargaretHeffernan_2012G FAMILIES SO WHAT SHE WANTED TO KNOW COULD EXPLAIN THIS ANOMALY
MargaretHeffernan_2012G NOW ALICE HAD TROUBLE GETTING FUNDING FOR HER RESEARCH IN THE END SHE GOT JUST ONE THOUSAND POUNDS FROM THE LADY TATA MEMORIAL PRIZE AND THAT MEANT SHE KNEW SHE ONLY HAD ONE SHOT AT COLLECTING HER DATA
MargaretHeffernan_2012G LIFE HAD THEY STARTED SCHOOL
MargaretHeffernan_2012G AND WHEN HER CARBON COPIED QUESTIONNAIRE STARTED TO COME BACK ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY JUMPED OUT WITH THE STATISTICAL CLARITY OF A KIND THAT MOST SCIENTISTS
MargaretHeffernan_2012G CAN ONLY DREAM OF BY A RATE OF TWO TO ONE THE CHILDREN WHO HAD DIED HAD HAD MOTHERS WHO HAD BEEN X RAYED WHEN PREGNANT NOW THAT
MargaretHeffernan_2012G NEVERTHELESS ALICE STEWART RUSHED
MargaretHeffernan_2012G IT WAS FULLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE BRITISH AND MEDICAL BRITISH AND AMERICAN MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENTS
MargaretHeffernan_2012G IT WAS OPEN IT WAS FREELY AVAILABLE BUT NOBODY WANTED TO KNOW
MargaretHeffernan_2012G A CHILD A WEEK WAS DYING
MargaretHeffernan_2012G BUT NOTHING CHANGED OPENNESS ALONE
MargaretHeffernan_2012G ALICE WAS VERY WARM VERY EMPATHETIC WITH HER PATIENTS GEORGE FRANKLY PREFERRED NUMBERS TO PEOPLE BUT HE SAID THIS FANTASTIC THING ABOUT THEIR WORKING RELATIONSHIP HE SAID MY JOB
MargaretHeffernan_2012G IS TO PROVE DR STEWART
MargaretHeffernan_2012G WRONG
MargaretHeffernan_2012G HE ACTIVELY SOUGHT DISCONFIRMATION DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT HER MODELS AT HER STATISTICS DIFFERENT WAYS OF CRUNCHING THE DATA IN ORDER TO DISPROVE HER
MargaretHeffernan_2012G HE SAW HIS JOB AS CREATING CONFLICT AROUND HER THEORIES BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY BY NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVE THAT SHE WAS WRONG THAT GEORGE COULD GIVE ALICE THE CONFIDENCE SHE
MargaretHeffernan_2012G NEEDED TO KNOW THAT SHE WAS RIGHT IT 'S A FANTASTIC MODEL
MargaretHeffernan_2012G SUCH COLLABORATORS ALICE AND GEORGE WERE VERY GOOD AT CONFLICT THEY SAW IT
MargaretHeffernan_2012G AS THINKING SO WHAT
MargaretHeffernan_2012G WELL FIRST OF ALL IT REQUIRES THAT WE FIND PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM OURSELVES THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO RESIST THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL DRIVE WHICH MEANS THAT WE REALLY PREFER PEOPLE MOSTLY LIKE OURSELVES AND IT MEANS WE HAVE TO SEEK OUT PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT
MargaretHeffernan_2012G THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF PATIENCE AND A LOT OF ENERGY AND THE MORE I 'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS THE MORE I THINK REALLY THAT THAT 'S A KIND
MargaretHeffernan_2012G IF YOU DON 'T REALLY CARE
MargaretHeffernan_2012G AND IT ALSO MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO CHANGE OUR MINDS ALICE 'S DAUGHTER TOLD ME THAT EVERY TIME ALICE WENT HEAD TO HEAD WITH A FELLOW SCIENTIST THEY MADE HER THINK AND THINK AND THINK
MargaretHeffernan_2012G OF LIVES SO HOW DO ORGANIZATIONS THINK
MargaretHeffernan_2012G OF CONFLICT
MargaretHeffernan_2012G IN SURVEYS OF EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN EXECUTIVES FULLY EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEM ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY HAD ISSUES OR CONCERNS AT WORK THAT THEY WERE AFRAID TO RAISE AFRAID OF THE
MargaretHeffernan_2012G EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT
MargaretHeffernan_2012G IS A REALLY BIG NUMBER
MargaretHeffernan_2012G IT MEANS THAT ORGANIZATIONS MOSTLY CAN 'T DO WHAT GEORGE AND ALICE SO TRIUMPHANTLY DID THEY CAN 'T THINK TOGETHER
MargaretHeffernan_2012G AND IT MEANS THAT PEOPLE LIKE MANY OF US WHO HAVE RUN ORGANIZATIONS AND GONE OUT OF OUR WAY TO TRY TO FIND THE VERY BEST PEOPLE WE CAN MOSTLY FAIL
MargaretHeffernan_2012G AND THEN WE HAVE TO GET REALLY GOOD AT
MargaretHeffernan_2012G THAT COULD REALLY HURT PEOPLE HE WAS AFRAID OF DOING DAMAGE TO THE PATIENTS HE WAS TRYING TO HELP BUT WHEN HE LOOKED AROUND HIS ORGANIZATION NOBODY ELSE SEEMED TO BE AT ALL WORRIED
MargaretHeffernan_2012G SO HE DIDN 'T REALLY WANT TO SAY ANYTHING AFTER ALL MAYBE THEY KNEW SOMETHING HE DIDN 'T MAYBE HE 'D LOOK STUPID BUT HE KEPT
MargaretHeffernan_2012G WAS LEAVE A JOB
MargaretHeffernan_2012G JOE AND I FOUND A WAY FOR HIM TO RAISE HIS CONCERNS AND WHAT HAPPENED THEN IS WHAT ALMOST ALWAYS HAPPENS IN THIS SITUATION IT TURNED OUT EVERYBODY HAD EXACTLY THE SAME QUESTIONS AND DOUBTS SO NOW JOE HAD ALLIES THEY COULD THINK TOGETHER
MargaretHeffernan_2012G AND YES THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFLICT AND DEBATE AND ARGUMENT BUT THAT ALLOWED EVERYONE AROUND THE TABLE TO BE CREATIVE
MargaretHeffernan_2012G TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MargaretHeffernan_2012G AND TO CHANGE THE DEVICE
MargaretHeffernan_2012G JOE WAS WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT THINK OF
MargaretHeffernan_2012G AND HIS COLLEAGUES DON 'T THINK OF HIM AS A CRANK
MargaretHeffernan_2012G WELL THE UNIVERSITY OF DELFT
MargaretHeffernan_2012G REQUIRES THAT ITS PHD STUDENTS HAVE TO SUBMIT FIVE STATEMENTS THAT THEY 'RE PREPARED TO DEFEND IT DOESN 'T REALLY MATTER WHAT THE STATEMENTS ARE
MargaretHeffernan_2012G FROM INFORMATION THAT IS SECRET
MargaretHeffernan_2012G HANDLE DON 'T WANT TO HANDLE
MargaretHeffernan_2012G THE CONFLICT THAT IT PROVOKES BUT WHEN WE DARE TO BREAK THAT SILENCE OR WHEN WE DARE TO SEE AND WE CREATE CONFLICT WE ENABLE OURSELVES AND THE PEOPLE AROUND US TO DO OUR VERY
MargaretHeffernan_2012G OPEN NETWORKS ARE ESSENTIAL
MargaretHeffernan_2012G BUT THE TRUTH WON 'T SET US FREE UNTIL WE DEVELOP THE SKILLS AND
