MargaretHeffernan_2012G@24.25:42.87 ALICE WAS UNUSUAL PARTLY BECAUSE OF COURSE SHE WAS A WOMAN WHICH WAS PRETTY RARE IN THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY S AND SHE WAS BRILLIANT SHE WAS ONE OF THE AT THE TIME THE YOUNGEST FELLOW TO BE ELECTED TO THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS SHE WAS UNUSUAL TOO BECAUSE SHE CONTINUED TO WORK AFTER SHE GOT MARRIED AFTER SHE HAD KIDS
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@42.87:58.06 AND EVEN AFTER SHE GOT DIVORCED AND WAS A SINGLE PARENT SHE CONTINUED HER MEDICAL WORK AND SHE WAS UNUSUAL BECAUSE SHE WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN A NEW SCIENCE THE EMERGING FIELD OF EPIDEMIOLOGY THE STUDY OF PATTERNS IN DISEASE
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@58.06:64.77 BUT LIKE EVERY SCIENTIST SHE APPRECIATED THAT TO MAKE HER MARK WHAT SHE NEEDED TO DO WAS FIND A HARD PROBLEM

MargaretHeffernan_2012G@67.76:81.3 THE HARD PROBLEM THAT ALICE CHOSE WAS THE RISING INCIDENCE OF CHILDHOOD CANCERS MOST DISEASE IS CORRELATED WITH POVERTY BUT IN THE CASE OF CHILDHOOD CANCERS THE CHILDREN WHO WERE DYING SEEMED MOSTLY TO COME FROM
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@81.62:87.43 FAMILIES SO WHAT SHE WANTED TO KNOW COULD EXPLAIN THIS ANOMALY
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@87.43:98.99 NOW ALICE HAD TROUBLE GETTING FUNDING FOR HER RESEARCH IN THE END SHE GOT JUST ONE THOUSAND POUNDS FROM THE LADY TATA MEMORIAL PRIZE AND THAT MEANT SHE KNEW SHE ONLY HAD ONE SHOT AT COLLECTING HER DATA
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@115.7:118.03 LIFE HAD THEY STARTED SCHOOL
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@118.03:128.11 AND WHEN HER CARBON COPIED QUESTIONNAIRE STARTED TO COME BACK ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY JUMPED OUT WITH THE STATISTICAL CLARITY OF A KIND THAT MOST SCIENTISTS
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@128.11:141.09 CAN ONLY DREAM OF BY A RATE OF TWO TO ONE THE CHILDREN WHO HAD DIED HAD HAD MOTHERS WHO HAD BEEN X RAYED WHEN PREGNANT NOW THAT
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@169.82:174.37 NEVERTHELESS ALICE STEWART RUSHED
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@194.05:202.37 IT WAS FULLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE BRITISH AND MEDICAL BRITISH AND AMERICAN MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENTS
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@211.08:216.32 IT WAS OPEN IT WAS FREELY AVAILABLE BUT NOBODY WANTED TO KNOW
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@216.43:219.43 A CHILD A WEEK WAS DYING
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@220.51:225.22 BUT NOTHING CHANGED OPENNESS ALONE
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@251.46:265.74 ALICE WAS VERY WARM VERY EMPATHETIC WITH HER PATIENTS GEORGE FRANKLY PREFERRED NUMBERS TO PEOPLE BUT HE SAID THIS FANTASTIC THING ABOUT THEIR WORKING RELATIONSHIP HE SAID MY JOB
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@265.83:268.04 IS TO PROVE DR STEWART
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@268.17:270.19 WRONG
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@270.19:281.4 HE ACTIVELY SOUGHT DISCONFIRMATION DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT HER MODELS AT HER STATISTICS DIFFERENT WAYS OF CRUNCHING THE DATA IN ORDER TO DISPROVE HER
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@281.53:296.03 HE SAW HIS JOB AS CREATING CONFLICT AROUND HER THEORIES BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY BY NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVE THAT SHE WAS WRONG THAT GEORGE COULD GIVE ALICE THE CONFIDENCE SHE
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@296.03:302.28 NEEDED TO KNOW THAT SHE WAS RIGHT IT 'S A FANTASTIC MODEL
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@314.41:323.24 SUCH COLLABORATORS ALICE AND GEORGE WERE VERY GOOD AT CONFLICT THEY SAW IT
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@323.64:326.34 AS THINKING SO WHAT
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@329.07:347.81 WELL FIRST OF ALL IT REQUIRES THAT WE FIND PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM OURSELVES THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO RESIST THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL DRIVE WHICH MEANS THAT WE REALLY PREFER PEOPLE MOSTLY LIKE OURSELVES AND IT MEANS WE HAVE TO SEEK OUT PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@356.88:366.93 THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF PATIENCE AND A LOT OF ENERGY AND THE MORE I 'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS THE MORE I THINK REALLY THAT THAT 'S A KIND
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@373.8:375.41 IF YOU DON 'T REALLY CARE
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@375.42:389.83 AND IT ALSO MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO CHANGE OUR MINDS ALICE 'S DAUGHTER TOLD ME THAT EVERY TIME ALICE WENT HEAD TO HEAD WITH A FELLOW SCIENTIST THEY MADE HER THINK AND THINK AND THINK
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@420.52:425.19 OF LIVES SO HOW DO ORGANIZATIONS THINK

MargaretHeffernan_2012G@467.53:471.27 EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@471.35:473.94 IS A REALLY BIG NUMBER
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@474.93:483.04 IT MEANS THAT ORGANIZATIONS MOSTLY CAN 'T DO WHAT GEORGE AND ALICE SO TRIUMPHANTLY DID THEY CAN 'T THINK TOGETHER
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@484.78:494.21 AND IT MEANS THAT PEOPLE LIKE MANY OF US WHO HAVE RUN ORGANIZATIONS AND GONE OUT OF OUR WAY TO TRY TO FIND THE VERY BEST PEOPLE WE CAN MOSTLY FAIL
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@512.42:514.59 AND THEN WE HAVE TO GET REALLY GOOD AT

MargaretHeffernan_2012G@584.88:594.93 AND YES THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFLICT AND DEBATE AND ARGUMENT BUT THAT ALLOWED EVERYONE AROUND THE TABLE TO BE CREATIVE
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@594.93:596.97 TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MargaretHeffernan_2012G@597.46:599.73 AND TO CHANGE THE DEVICE
