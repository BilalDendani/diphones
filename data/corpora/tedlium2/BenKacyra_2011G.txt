BenKacyra_2011G THEY WOULD ALWAYS STOP BY TO VISIT THESE HUGE WINGED BULLS THAT USED TO GUARD THE GATES OF THAT ANCIENT METROPOLIS AND THE BOY USED TO BE SCARED OF THESE WINGED BULLS BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY EXCITED HIM AND THE DAD USED TO USE THOSE BULLS TO TELL THE BOY STORIES
BenKacyra_2011G ABOUT THAT CIVILIZATION AND THEIR WORK
BenKacyra_2011G LET 'S FAST FORWARD TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA MANY DECADES LATER WHERE I STARTED A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT BROUGHT THE WORLD ITS FIRST THREE D LASER SCANNING SYSTEM LET ME SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS
BenKacyra_2011G THE POINT IS THEN RECORDED INTO A THREE D VISUALIZATION PROGRAM
BenKacyra_2011G YOU CAN SEE HERE THESE SYSTEMS ARE EXTREMELY FAST THEY COLLECT MILLIONS OF POINTS AT A TIME WITH VERY HIGH ACCURACY AND VERY HIGH RESOLUTION A SURVEYOR WITH
BenKacyra_2011G TRADITIONAL SURVEY TOOLS WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO PRODUCE MAYBE FIVE HUNDRED POINTS IN A WHOLE DAY THESE BABIES WOULD BE PRODUCING SOMETHING LIKE TEN THOUSAND POINTS A SECOND
BenKacyra_2011G SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS WAS A PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE SURVEY AND CONSTRUCTION AS WELL AS IN REALITY CAPTURE INDUSTRY
BenKacyra_2011G APPROXIMATELY TEN YEARS AGO MY WIFE AND I STARTED A FOUNDATION TO DO GOOD AND RIGHT ABOUT THAT TIME THE MAGNIFICENT BAMIYAN BUDDHAS HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOOT TALL IN AFGHANISTAN
BenKacyra_2011G WERE BLOWN UP BY THE TALIBAN THEY WERE GONE IN AN INSTANT AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS NO DETAILED DOCUMENTATION OF THESE BUDDHAS THIS CLEARLY DEVASTATED ME AND I COULDN 'T HELP BUT WONDER ABOUT THE FATE OF MY OLD FRIENDS THE WINGED BULLS
BenKacyra_2011G AND THE FATE OF THE MANY MANY HERITAGE SITES ALL OVER THE WORLD
BenKacyra_2011G BOTH MY WIFE AND I WERE SO
BenKacyra_2011G TOUCHED BY THIS THAT WE DECIDED TO EXPAND THE MISSION OF OUR FOUNDATION TO INCLUDE DIGITAL HERITAGE PRESERVATION OF
BenKacyra_2011G WORLD SITES WE CALLED THE PROJECT CYARK WHICH STANDS FOR CYBER ARCHIVE
BenKacyra_2011G TO DATE WITH THE HELP OF A
BenKacyra_2011G GLOBAL NETWORK OF PARTNERS WE 'VE COMPLETED CLOSE TO FIFTY PROJECTS LET ME SHOW YOU SOME OF THEM
BenKacyra_2011G CHICHEN ITZA RAPA NUI AND WHAT YOU 'RE SEEING HERE ARE THE CLOUD OF POINTS BABYLON
BenKacyra_2011G THE RESULTS OF OUR WORK IN THE FIELD ARE USED TO PRODUCE MEDIA AND DELIVERABLES TO BE USED BY CONSERVATORS AND RESEARCHERS WE ALSO PRODUCE
BenKacyra_2011G MEDIA FOR DISSEMINATION TO THE PUBLIC FREE THROUGH THE CYARK WEBSITE THESE WOULD BE USED FOR EDUCATION CULTURAL TOURISM ETC WHAT YOU 'RE LOOKING AT IN HERE IS A THREE D VIEWER THAT WE DEVELOPED THAT WOULD ALLOW
BenKacyra_2011G THE DISPLAY AND MANIPULATION OF THE CLOUD OF POINTS IN REAL TIME CUTTING SECTIONS THROUGH THEM AND EXTRACTING DIMENSIONS THIS HAPPENS TO BE THE CLOUD OF POINTS FOR TIKAL IN HERE YOU SEE A TRADITIONAL TWO D ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING DRAWING THAT 'S USED FOR PRESERVATION
BenKacyra_2011G AND OF COURSE WE TELL THE STORIES THROUGH FLY THROUGHS AND HERE THIS IS A FLY THROUGH THE CLOUD OF POINTS OF TIKAL AND HERE YOU SEE IT RENDERED AND PHOTO TEXTURED WITH THE PHOTOGRAPHY THAT WE TAKE OF THE SITE
BenKacyra_2011G AND SO THIS IS NOT A VIDEO THIS IS ACTUAL THREE D POINTS WITH TWO TO THREE MILLIMETER ACCURACY AND OF COURSE THE DATA CAN BE USED TO DEVELOP THREE D MODELS THAT ARE
BenKacyra_2011G VERY ACCURATE AND VERY DETAILED AND HERE YOU 'RE LOOKING AT A MODEL THAT 'S EXTRACTED FROM THE CLOUD OF POINTS FOR STIRLING CASTLE IT 'S USED FOR STUDIES FOR VISUALIZATION AS WELL AS FOR EDUCATION
BenKacyra_2011G AND FINALLY WE PRODUCE MOBILE APPS THAT INCLUDE NARRATED VIRTUAL TOOLS THE MORE
BenKacyra_2011G I GOT INVOLVED IN THE HERITAGE FIELD THE MORE IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT WE ARE LOSING THE SITES AND THE STORIES FASTER THAN WE CAN PHYSICALLY PRESERVE THEM
BenKacyra_2011G OF COURSE EARTHQUAKES AND ALL THE NATURAL PHENOMENA FLOODS TORNADOES ETC TAKE THEIR TOLL
BenKacyra_2011G HOWEVER WHAT OCCURRED TO ME WAS HUMAN CAUSED DESTRUCTION WHICH WAS NOT ONLY CAUSING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE DESTRUCTION BUT ACTUALLY IT WAS ACCELERATING THIS INCLUDES ARSON
BenKacyra_2011G IT WAS GETTING MORE AND MORE APPARENT THAT WE 'RE FIGHTING A LOSING BATTLE WE 'RE LOSING OUR SITES AND THE STORIES AND BASICALLY WE 'RE LOSING A PIECE AND A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF OUR COLLECTIVE MEMORY
BenKacyra_2011G IMAGINE US AS A HUMAN RACE NOT KNOWING WHERE WE CAME FROM
BenKacyra_2011G LUCKILY IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE DECADES DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING THAT HAVE HELPED US TO DEVELOP TOOLS THAT WE 'VE BROUGHT TO BEAR IN THE DIGITAL PRESERVATION IN OUR DIGITAL PRESERVATION WAR THIS INCLUDES
BenKacyra_2011G FOR EXAMPLE THE THREE D LASER SCANNING SYSTEMS EVER MORE POWERFUL PERSONAL COMPUTERS THREE D GRAPHICS HIGH DEFINITION DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY NOT TO MENTION THE INTERNET BECAUSE OF THIS ACCELERATED PACE OF DESTRUCTION
BenKacyra_2011G IT BECAME CLEAR TO US THAT WE NEEDED TO CHALLENGE OURSELVES AND OUR PARTNERS TO ACCELERATE OUR WORK AND WE CREATED A PROJECT WE CALL THE CYARK FIVE HUNDRED CHALLENGE
BenKacyra_2011G AND THAT IS TO DIGITALLY PRESERVE
BenKacyra_2011G AND OUR NETWORK OF GLOBAL PARTNERS HAS BEEN EXPANDING AND CAN BE EXPANDED AT A RAPID RATE SO WE 'RE COMFORTABLE THAT THIS TASK CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED
BenKacyra_2011G HOWEVER TO ME THE FIVE HUNDRED IS REALLY JUST THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN OUR WORK
BenKacyra_2011G INTO THE FUTURE WE USE TECHNOLOGY CENTERS WHERE WE PARTNER WITH LOCAL UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES TO TAKE THE TECHNOLOGY TO THEM WHEREBY THEY THEN CAN HELP US WITH DIGITAL PRESERVATION OF THEIR HERITAGE SITES
BenKacyra_2011G AND AT THE SAME TIME IT GIVES THEM
BenKacyra_2011G THE TECHNOLOGY TO BENEFIT FROM IN THE FUTURE
BenKacyra_2011G LET ME CLOSE WITH ANOTHER SHORT STORY TWO YEARS AGO WE WERE APPROACHED BY A PARTNER OF OURS
BenKacyra_2011G TO DIGITALLY PRESERVE AN IMPORTANT HERITAGE SITE A UNESCO HERITAGE SITE IN UGANDA THE ROYAL KASUBI TOMBS THE WORK WAS DONE SUCCESSFULLY IN THE FIELD AND THE DATA WAS ARCHIVED AND PUBLICLY DISSEMINATED THROUGH THE CYARK WEBSITE
BenKacyra_2011G LAST MARCH WE RECEIVED VERY SAD NEWS THE ROYAL TOMBS HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY SUSPECTED ARSON A FEW DAYS LATER WE RECEIVED A CALL IS THE DATA AVAILABLE AND CAN IT BE USED FOR RECONSTRUCTION
BenKacyra_2011G OUR ANSWER OF COURSE WAS YES
BenKacyra_2011G LET ME LEAVE YOU WITH A FINAL THOUGHT OUR HERITAGE IS MUCH MORE THAN OUR COLLECTIVE MEMORY IT 'S OUR COLLECTIVE TREASURE WE OWE IT TO OUR CHILDREN OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND THE GENERATIONS WE WILL NEVER MEET TO KEEP IT SAFE
BenKacyra_2011G AND TO PASS IT ALONG THANK YOU
BenKacyra_2011G WELL I 'M STAYING HERE BECAUSE WE WANTED TO DEMONSTRATE TO YOU THE POWER OF THIS TECHNOLOGY AND SO WHILE I 'VE BEEN SPEAKING YOU
BenKacyra_2011G HAVE BEEN SCANNED
BenKacyra_2011G THE TWO WIZARDS THAT I HAVE THAT ARE BEHIND THE CURTAIN WILL HELP ME BRING THE RESULTS
BenKacyra_2011G ON THE SCREEN
BenKacyra_2011G THIS IS ALL IN THREE D AND OF COURSE YOU CAN FLY THROUGH THE CLOUD OF POINTS YOU CAN LOOK AT IT FROM ON TOP FROM THE CEILING YOU CAN LOOK FROM DIFFERENT VANTAGE POINTS BUT I 'M GOING TO ASK DOUG TO ZOOM IN ON
BenKacyra_2011G AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE CROWD JUST TO SHOW THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL THAT WE CAN CREATE
BenKacyra_2011G SO YOU HAVE BEEN DIGITALLY PRESERVED IN ABOUT FOUR MINUTES
BenKacyra_2011G I 'D LIKE TO ALSO THANK PERSONALLY THE EFFORTS OF
BenKacyra_2011G AND DOUG PRITCHARD WHO 'S THE HEAD OF VISUALIZATION AT THE GLASGOW SCHOOL OF ART LET 'S GIVE THEM
