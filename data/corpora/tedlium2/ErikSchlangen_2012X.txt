ErikSchlangen_2012X ALSO ASPHALT CAN CREATE A LOT OF NOISE IT 'S A NOISY MATERIAL AND IF WE PRODUCE ROADS LIKE IN THE NETHERLANDS VERY CLOSE TO CITIES THEN WE WOULD LIKE A SILENT ROAD
ErikSchlangen_2012X THAT THE STONES AT THE SURFACE COME OFF FIRST YOU GET ONE STONE THEN SEVERAL MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND THEN THEY WELL I WILL NOT DO THAT
ErikSchlangen_2012X THIS BINDER THIS BITUMEN THE GLUE BETWEEN THE AGGREGATES IS GOING TO SHRINK
ErikSchlangen_2012X INDUCTION CAN HEAT ESPECIALLY STEEL IT 'S VERY GOOD AT THAT THEN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HEAT UP THE STEEL YOU MELT THE BITUMEN AND THE BITUMEN WILL FLOW INTO THESE MICRO CRACKS AND THE STONES ARE AGAIN FIXED TO THE SURFACE
ErikSchlangen_2012X TODAY I USE A MICROWAVE BECAUSE I CANNOT
ErikSchlangen_2012X SO THIS IS THE SPECIMEN COMING OUT NOW
ErikSchlangen_2012X SO I SAID WE HAVE SUCH AN INDUSTRIAL MACHINE IN THE LAB TO HEAT UP THE SPECIMENS WE TESTED A LOT OF SPECIMENS THERE AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT THEY ACTUALLY SAW OUR RESULTS
ErikSchlangen_2012X AND THEN OF COURSE THIS ROAD WILL LAST SEVERAL YEARS WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE THAT 'S WHAT WE KNOW FROM PRACTICE
ErikSchlangen_2012X SO WE TOOK A LOT OF SAMPLES FROM THIS ROAD AND WE TESTED THEM IN THE LAB
ErikSchlangen_2012X SO WE DID AGING ON THE SAMPLES DID A LOT OF LOADING ON IT HEALED THEM WITH OUR INDUCTION MACHINE AND HEALED THEM AND TESTED THEM AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES WE CAN REPEAT THAT
ErikSchlangen_2012X SO ACTUALLY THE CONCLUSION FROM THIS RESEARCH IS THAT IF WE GO ON THE ROAD EVERY FOUR YEARS WITH OUR HEALING MACHINE THIS IS THE BIG VERSION WE HAVE MADE TO GO ON THE REAL ROAD IF WE GO ON THE ROAD EVERY FOUR YEARS WE CAN DOUBLE THE SURFACE LIFE OF THIS ROAD WHICH OF COURSE SAVES A LOT OF MONEY
ErikSchlangen_2012X WELL TO CONCLUDE I CAN SAY THAT WE MADE A MATERIAL
ErikSchlangen_2012X USING STEEL FIBERS THE ADDITION OF STEEL FIBERS USING INDUCTION ENERGY TO REALLY INCREASE THE SURFACE LIFE OF THE ROAD DOUBLE THE SURFACE LIFE YOU CAN EVEN DO SO IT WILL REALLY SAVE A LOT OF MONEY WITH VERY SIMPLE TRICKS
