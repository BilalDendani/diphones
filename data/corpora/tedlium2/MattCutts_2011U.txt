MattCutts_2011U A
MattCutts_2011U AND TRY SOMETHING NEW FOR THIRTY DAYS
MattCutts_2011U THE IDEA IS ACTUALLY PRETTY SIMPLE THINK ABOUT SOMETHING YOU 'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO ADD TO YOUR LIFE AND TRY IT FOR THE NEXT THIRTY DAYS
MattCutts_2011U IT TURNS OUT THIRTY DAYS IS JUST ABOUT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME TO ADD A NEW HABIT OR SUBTRACT A HABIT LIKE WATCHING THE NEWS FROM YOUR LIFE THERE 'S A FEW THINGS I LEARNED WHILE DOING THESE THIRTY DAY CHALLENGES
MattCutts_2011U THE FIRST WAS INSTEAD OF THE MONTHS FLYING BY FORGOTTEN THE TIME WAS MUCH MORE MEMORABLE THIS WAS PART OF A CHALLENGE I DID TO TAKE A PICTURE EVERY DAY FOR A MONTH AND I REMEMBER EXACTLY WHERE I WAS AND WHAT I WAS DOING THAT DAY
MattCutts_2011U I ALSO NOTICED THAT AS I STARTED TO DO MORE AND HARDER THIRTY DAY CHALLENGES MY SELF CONFIDENCE GREW I WENT FROM DESK DWELLING COMPUTER NERD TO THE KIND OF GUY WHO BIKES TO WORK FOR FUN
MattCutts_2011U EVEN LAST YEAR I ENDED UP HIKING UP MT KILIMANJARO THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN IN AFRICA I WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN THAT ADVENTUROUS BEFORE I STARTED MY THIRTY DAY CHALLENGES I ALSO FIGURED OUT THAT IF YOU REALLY WANT SOMETHING BADLY ENOUGH YOU CAN DO ANYTHING FOR THIRTY DAYS
MattCutts_2011U EVERY NOVEMBER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TRY TO WRITE THEIR OWN FIFTY THOUSAND WORD NOVEL FROM SCRATCH IN THIRTY DAYS IT TURNS OUT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WRITE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN WORDS A DAY FOR A MONTH SO I DID
MattCutts_2011U BY THE WAY THE SECRET IS NOT TO GO TO SLEEP UNTIL YOU 'VE WRITTEN YOUR WORDS FOR THE DAY YOU MIGHT BE SLEEP DEPRIVED BUT YOU 'LL FINISH YOUR NOVEL NOW IS MY BOOK THE NEXT GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL
MattCutts_2011U NO I WROTE IT IN A MONTH
MattCutts_2011U SO HERE 'S ONE LAST THING I 'D LIKE TO MENTION I LEARNED THAT WHEN I MADE SMALL SUSTAINABLE CHANGES THINGS I COULD KEEP DOING THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO STICK THERE 'S NOTHING WRONG WITH BIG CRAZY CHALLENGES IN FACT THEY 'RE A TON OF FUN BUT THEY 'RE LESS LIKELY TO STICK
MattCutts_2011U WHEN I GAVE UP SUGAR FOR THIRTY DAYS DAY THIRTY ONE LOOKED LIKE THIS
