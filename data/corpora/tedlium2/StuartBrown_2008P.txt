StuartBrown_2008P GO A FLYBY OF PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P IT'S GOT TO BE SERIOUS IF THE NEW YORK TIMES PUTS A COVER STORY OF THEIR FEBRUARY SEVENTEENTH SUNDAY MAGAZINE ABOUT PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS IT SAYS IT 'S DEEPER THAN GENDER SERIOUSLY BUT DANGEROUSLY FUN
StuartBrown_2008P A SANDBOX FOR NEW IDEAS ABOUT EVOLUTION
StuartBrown_2008P NOT BAD EXCEPT IF YOU LOOK AT THAT COVER WHAT'S MISSING
StuartBrown_2008P YOU SEE ANY ADULTS
StuartBrown_2008P WELL LETS GO BACK TO THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY
StuartBrown_2008P THIS IS A COURTYARD IN EUROPE
StuartBrown_2008P AND A MIXTURE OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR DIFFERENT KINDS OF PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P ALL AGES SOLO PLAY BODY PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P GAMES TAUNTING AND THERE IT IS AND I THINK THIS IS A TYPICAL PICTURE OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN A COURTYARD THEN
StuartBrown_2008P I THINK WE MAY HAVE LOST SOMETHING IN OUR CULTURE
StuartBrown_2008P SO I'M GONNA TAKE YOU THROUGH
StuartBrown_2008P AND FROM OUT OF STAGE LEFT COMES THIS WILD MALE POLAR BEAR WITH A PREDATORY GAZE
StuartBrown_2008P OF YOU WHO 'VE BEEN TO AFRICA OR HAD A JUNKYARD DOG COME AFTER YOU THERE IS A FIXED KIND OF PREDATORY GAZE THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN TROUBLE
StuartBrown_2008P BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT PREDATORY GAZE IS A FEMALE HUSKY
StuartBrown_2008P IN A PLAY BOW WAGGING HER TALE AND SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAPPENS THAT FIXED BEHAVIOR
StuartBrown_2008P WHICH IS RIGGED AND STEREOTYPED AND ENDS UP WITH A MEAL CHANGES AND THIS POLAR BEAR STANDS OVER THE HUSKY
StuartBrown_2008P NO CLAWS EXTENDED NO FANGS TAKING A LOOK
StuartBrown_2008P THIS IS IN NATURE IT OVERRIDES A CARNIVOROUS NATURE AND WHAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SHORT FIGHT TO THE DEATH
StuartBrown_2008P IF YOU'LL BEGIN TO LOOK CLOSELY AT THE HUSKY THAT'S BEARING HER THROAT TO THE POLAR BEAR
StuartBrown_2008P AND LOOK A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY THEY'RE IN AN ALTERED
StuartBrown_2008P STATE THEY'RE IN A STATE OF PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P AND IT'S THAT STATE
StuartBrown_2008P THAT ALLOWS THESE
StuartBrown_2008P TWO CREATURES TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBLE THEY ARE BEGINNING TO DO SOMETHING THAT NEITHER WOULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT THE PLAY SIGNALS
StuartBrown_2008P AND IT IS A MARVELOUS EXAMPLE OF HOW A DIFFERENTIAL IN POWER CAN BE OVERRIDDEN
StuartBrown_2008P BY A PROCESS OF NATURE THAT'S WITHIN ALL OF US NOW HOW DID I GET INVOLVED IN THIS JOHN MENTIONED THAT I'VE DONE SOME
StuartBrown_2008P WITH MURDERERS AND I HAVE THE TEXAS TOWER MURDERER OPENED MY EYES
StuartBrown_2008P IN RETROSPECT WHEN WE STUDIED HIS TRAGIC MASS MURDER
StuartBrown_2008P TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PLAY IN THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL BY DEEP STUDY WAS FOUND TO HAVE SEVERE PLAY DEPRIVATION CHARLES WHITMAN WAS HIS NAME
StuartBrown_2008P AND OUR COMMITTEE WHICH CONSISTED OF A LOT OF HARD SCIENTISTS DID FEEL AT THE END OF THAT STUDY THAT THE ABSENCE OF PLAY AND A PROGRESSIVE SUPPRESSION OF DEVELOPMENTALLY NORMAL PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P LED HIM TO BE MORE VULNERABLE TO THE TRAGEDY THAT HE PERPETRATED AND THAT FINDING HAS STOOD THE TEST OF TIME UNFORTUNATELY EVEN INTO MORE RECENT TIMES AT VIRGINIA TECH
StuartBrown_2008P AND OTHER STUDIES OF POPULATIONS AT RISK SENSITIZED ME TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P BUT I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS AND IT WAS MANY YEARS IN TAKING PLAY HISTORIES OF INDIVIDUALS BEFORE I REALLY BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE THAT
StuartBrown_2008P I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF IT AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF US HAS A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF IT BY ANY MEANS BUT
StuartBrown_2008P THERE ARE WAYS OF LOOKING AT IT THAT I THINK CAN GIVE YOU GIVE US ALL A TAXONOMY A WAY OF THINKING ABOUT IT AND THIS IMAGE IS FOR HUMANS THE BEGINNING POINT OF PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P WHEN THAT MOTHER AND INFANT LOCK EYES AND THE INFANT 'S OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE A SOCIAL SMILE WHAT HAPPENS
StuartBrown_2008P BRAIN OF EACH OF THEM
StuartBrown_2008P BECOMES ATTUNED SO THAT THE JOYFUL EMERGENCE OF THIS EARLIEST OF PLAY SCENES AND THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THAT IS SOMETHING WE'RE BEGINNING TO GET A HANDLE ON
StuartBrown_2008P AND I'D LIKE YOU TO THINK THAT EVERY BIT OF MORE COMPLEX PLAY BUILDS ON THIS BASE
StuartBrown_2008P FOR US HUMANS AND SO NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU THROUGH SORT OF A WAY OF LOOKING AT PLAY BUT IT'S NEVER JUST
StuartBrown_2008P ONE THING WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT BODY PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P WHICH IS A SPONTANEOUS DESIRE TO GET OURSELVES OUT OF GRAVITY THIS IS A
StuartBrown_2008P IF YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY TRY THIS JUMP UP AND DOWN WIGGLE AROUND YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL BETTER AND YOU MAY FEEL LIKE THIS CHARACTER WHO IS ALSO JUST
StuartBrown_2008P FOR ITS OWN SAKE IT DOESN'T HAVE A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND THAT'S WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT PLAY IF ITS PURPOSE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ACT OF DOING IT IT'S PROBABLY NOT PLAY AND THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER TYPE OF PLAY WHICH IS OBJECT PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P AND THEY DON'T THROW IT AT EACH OTHER BUT THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF BEING PLAYFUL THE HUMAN HAND IN MANIPULATION OF OBJECTS
StuartBrown_2008P IS THE HAND IN SEARCH OF A BRAIN THE BRAIN IS IN SEARCH OF A HAND AND PLAY IS THE MEDIUM BY WHICH THOSE TWO ARE LINKED IN THE BEST WAY
StuartBrown_2008P WE HEARD THIS MORNING JPL IS AN INCREDIBLE PLACE THEY HAVE LOCATED TWO CONSULTANTS
StuartBrown_2008P TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHY AND HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION QUITE ON HIS OWN THAT THE STUDENTS WHO COULD NO LONGER SOLVE PROBLEMS SUCH AS FIXING CARS HADN'T WORKED WITH THEIR HANDS
StuartBrown_2008P BEFORE THEY WILL HIRE A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROBLEM SOLVER EVEN IF THEY'RE SUMMA CUM LAUDE FROM HARVARD OR CAL TECH IF THEY HAVEN'T FIXED CARS HAVEN'T DONE STUFF WITH THEIR HANDS EARLY IN LIFE
StuartBrown_2008P WITH THEIR HANDS THEY CAN'T PROBLEM SOLVE AS WELL SO PLAY IS PRACTICAL AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT NOW ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P HAS TO BE SAFE EXPLORATION THIS HAPPENS TO BE OK HE 'S AN ANATOMICALLY INTERESTED LITTLE BOY AND THAT'S HIS MOM OTHER SITUATIONS WOULDN'T BE QUITE SO
StuartBrown_2008P GOOD BUT CURIOSITY EXPLORATION ARE PART OF THE PLAY SCENE IF YOU WANT TO BELONG YOU NEED SOCIAL PLAY AND SOCIAL PLAY IS PART OF WHAT WE'RE ABOUT HERE TODAY
StuartBrown_2008P AND IS A BYPRODUCT OF THE PLAY SCENE ROUGH AND TUMBLE PLAY THESE LIONESSES SEEN FROM A DISTANCE LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE FIGHTING
StuartBrown_2008P OPEN MOUTH WITH NO FANGS BALLETIC MOVEMENTS CURVILINEAR MOVEMENTS ALL SPECIFIC TO PLAY AND ROUGH AND TUMBLE PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P A GREAT LEARNING MEDIUM FOR ALL OF US PRESCHOOL KIDS FOR EXAMPLE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DIVE HIT WHISTLE SCREAM BE CHAOTIC
StuartBrown_2008P AND DEVELOP THROUGH THAT A LOT OF EMOTIONAL REGULATION AND A LOT OF THE OTHER SOCIAL BYPRODUCTS COGNITIVE EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL THAT COME AS A PART OF ROUGH AND TUMBLE PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P RARE WHERE THE RED SOX WON THE WORLD SERIES BUT TAKE A LOOK AT THE FACE AND THE BODY LANGUAGE OF EVERYBODY IN THIS FUZZY PICTURE AND YOU CAN GET A SENSE THAT THEY'RE ALL AT PLAY IMAGINATIVE PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF BEING A PLAYER IS IMAGINATIVE SOLO PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P AND I LOVE THIS ONE BECAUSE IT'S ALSO WHAT WE'RE ABOUT WE ALL HAVE AN INTERNAL NARRATIVE THAT'S OUR OWN INNER STORY THE UNIT OF INTELLIGIBILITY OF MOST OF OUR BRAINS IS THE STORY
StuartBrown_2008P I'M TELLING YOU A STORY TODAY ABOUT PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P WELL THIS BUSHMAN I THINK IS TALKING ABOUT THE FISH THAT GOT AWAY THAT WAS THAT LONG BUT IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE PLAY SCENE
StuartBrown_2008P SO WHAT DOES PLAY DO FOR THE BRAIN
StuartBrown_2008P WELL A LOT
StuartBrown_2008P WE DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT ABOUT WHAT IT
StuartBrown_2008P DOES FOR THE HUMAN BRAIN BECAUSE FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN EXACTLY
StuartBrown_2008P HEAVY FOR RESEARCH ON PLAY I WALKED INTO THE CARNEGIE ASKING FOR A GRANT THEY'D GIVEN ME A LARGE GRANT WHEN I WAS AN ACADEMICIAN
StuartBrown_2008P FOR THE STUDY OF FELONY DRUNKEN DRIVERS AND I THOUGHT I HAD A PRETTY GOOD TRACK RECORD AND BY THE TIME I HAD SPENT HALF AN HOUR TALKING ABOUT PLAY IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THEY WERE NOT
StuartBrown_2008P IS SOME GOOD SCIENCE NOTHING LIGHTS UP THE BRAIN LIKE PLAY THREE DIMENSIONAL PLAY FIRES UP THE CEREBELLUM
StuartBrown_2008P A LOT OF IMPULSES INTO THE FRONTAL LOBE THE EXECUTIVE PORTION HELPS CONTEXTUAL MEMORY BE DEVELOPED
StuartBrown_2008P AND AND AND AND SO IT'S FOR ME ITS BEEN AN EXTREMELY NOURISHING SCHOLARLY ADVENTURE
StuartBrown_2008P TO LOOK AT THE NEUROSCIENCE THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH PLAY AND TO BRING TOGETHER PEOPLE WHO IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL DISCIPLINES HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE NATIONAL
StuartBrown_2008P I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE A PLAYFUL LOOKING SUBJECT BUT IT ALLOWS MOBILITY WHICH HAS LIMITED THE ACTUAL STUDY OF PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P AND WE'VE GOT A MOTHER INFANT PLAY SCENARIO THAT WE'RE HOPING TO COMPLETE UNDERWAY AT THE MOMENT THE REASON I PUT THIS HERE IS ALSO TO QUEUE UP MY THOUGHTS ABOUT OBJECTIFYING WHAT PLAY DOES
StuartBrown_2008P TO PLAY AT A CERTAIN PERIOD OF THEIR JUVENILE YEARS
StuartBrown_2008P AND YOU SUPPRESS PLAY THEY SQUEAK THEY WRESTLE THEY PIN EACH OTHER THAT'S PART OF THEIR PLAY IF YOU STOP THAT BEHAVIOR
StuartBrown_2008P ON ONE GROUP THAT YOU'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH AND YOU ALLOW IT IN ANOTHER GROUP THAT YOU'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH AND THEN YOU PRESENT THOSE RATS
StuartBrown_2008P WITH A CAT ODOR SATURATED COLLAR
StuartBrown_2008P THEY'RE HARDWIRED TO FLEE AND
StuartBrown_2008P THEY BOTH HIDE OUT
StuartBrown_2008P THE NON PLAYERS NEVER COME OUT
StuartBrown_2008P THEY DIE THE PLAYERS
StuartBrown_2008P SLOWLY EXPLORE THE ENVIRONMENT AND BEGIN AGAIN TO TEST THINGS OUT
StuartBrown_2008P THAT SAYS TO ME AT LEAST IN RATS AND I THINK THEY HAVE THE SAME NEUROTRANSMITTERS THAT WE DO AND A SIMILAR CORTICAL ARCHITECTURE THAT
StuartBrown_2008P PLAY MAY BE PRETTY IMPORTANT FOR OUR SURVIVAL AND AND AND THERE ARE A LOT MORE ANIMAL STUDIES THAT I COULD TALK ABOUT NOW
StuartBrown_2008P THIS IS A
StuartBrown_2008P IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS AND OTHERS WHEN THEY'RE PLAY DEPRIVED THEY AND RATS ALSO THEY DON'T DEVELOP A BRAIN THAT IS NORMAL
StuartBrown_2008P NOW THE PROGRAM SAYS THAT THE OPPOSITE OF PLAY IS NOT WORK
StuartBrown_2008P AND I THINK IF YOU THINK ABOUT LIFE WITHOUT PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P NO HUMOR NO FLIRTATION NO MOVIES NO GAMES NO FANTASY
StuartBrown_2008P AND AND AND TRY AND IMAGINE
StuartBrown_2008P A CULTURE OR A LIFE ADULT OR OTHERWISE
StuartBrown_2008P AND THE THING THAT'S SO UNIQUE ABOUT OUR SPECIES IS THAT WE'RE REALLY DESIGNED TO PLAY THROUGH OUR WHOLE LIFETIME
StuartBrown_2008P AND WE ALL HAVE CAPACITY TO PLAY SIGNAL NOBODY MISSES THAT DOG I TOOK A PICTURE OF ON A CARMEL BEACH A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WHAT'S GOING TO FOLLOW FROM THAT BEHAVIOR
StuartBrown_2008P IS PLAY AND YOU CAN TRUST IT THE BASIS OF HUMAN TRUST IS ESTABLISHED THROUGH PLAY SIGNALS AND WE BEGIN TO LOSE THOSE SIGNALS CULTURALLY AND OTHERWISE AS
StuartBrown_2008P THAT'S A SHAME I THINK WE'VE GOT A LOT OF LEARNING TO DO NOW JANE GOODALL HAS HERE A PLAY FACE ALONG WITH ONE OF HER FAVORITE CHIMPS SO PART OF THE SIGNALING SYSTEM OF PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P HAS TO DO WITH VOCAL FACIAL BODY GESTURAL YOU KNOW YOU CAN TELL AND I THINK WHEN WE'RE GETTING INTO COLLECTIVE PLAY ITS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR
StuartBrown_2008P GROUPS TO GAIN A SENSE OF SAFETY THROUGH THEIR OWN SHARING OF PLAY SIGNALS YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS WORD
StuartBrown_2008P IT SHOULD BE YOUR BIOLOGICAL FIRST NAME AND LAST NAME BECAUSE NEOTENY MEANS THE RETENTION OF IMMATURE QUALITIES INTO ADULTHOOD AND WE ARE BY PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGISTS
StuartBrown_2008P BY MANY MANY STUDIES THE MOST NEOTENOUS THE MOST YOUTHFUL THE MOST FLEXIBLE THE MOST PLASTIC OF ALL CREATURES AND THEREFORE THE MOST PLAYFUL AND THIS GIVES US A LEG UP ON ADAPTABILITY
StuartBrown_2008P NOW THERE IS A WAY OF LOOKING AT PLAY THAT I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE HERE
StuartBrown_2008P WHICH IS THE PLAY HISTORY YOUR OWN PERSONAL PLAY HISTORY IS UNIQUE AND OFTEN IS NOT SOMETHING WE THINK ABOUT PARTICULARLY THIS IS A BOOK WRITTEN BY A CONSUMMATE PLAYER BY THE NAME OF KEVIN CARROLL
StuartBrown_2008P KEVIN CARROLL CAME FROM EXTREMELY DEPRIVED CIRCUMSTANCES ALCOHOLIC MOTHER ABSENT FATHER INNER CITY PHILADELPHIA BLACK HAD TO TAKE CARE OF A YOUNGER BROTHER
StuartBrown_2008P FOUND THAT WHEN HE LOOKED AT A
StuartBrown_2008P OUT OF A WINDOW INTO WHICH HE HAD BEEN CONFINED
StuartBrown_2008P HE FELT SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND SO HE FOLLOWED UP ON
StuartBrown_2008P THE TRANSFORMATION OF HIS LIFE FROM THE DEPRIVATION AND WHAT ONE WOULD EXPECT POTENTIALLY PRISON OR DEATH
StuartBrown_2008P BECOME A LINGUIST A TRAINER FOR THE SEVENTY SIX ERS AND NOW IS A MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER AND HE GIVES PLAY AS
StuartBrown_2008P FORCE OVER HIS ENTIRE LIFE NOW THERE'S ANOTHER PLAY HISTORY THAT I THINK IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
StuartBrown_2008P THOSE OF YOU WHO REMEMBER AL GORE DURING THE
StuartBrown_2008P FIRST TERM AND THEN DURING HIS SUCCESSFUL BUT UNELECTED RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY
StuartBrown_2008P AND LOOKING AT HIS HISTORY WHICH IS COMMON IN THE PRESS IT SEEMS TO ME AT LEAST LOOKING AT IT FROM A SHRINK 'S POINT OF VIEW THAT A LOT OF HIS LIFE WAS
StuartBrown_2008P SUMMERS WERE HARD HARD WORK
StuartBrown_2008P IN THE HEAT OF TENNESSEE SUMMERS HE HAD THE EXPECTATIONS OF HIS SENATORIAL FATHER AND WASHINGTON D C AND ALTHOUGH
StuartBrown_2008P I THINK AS HE NOW IS
StuartBrown_2008P BY PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT IS HIS OWN PASSION AND HIS OWN INNER DRIVE WHICH I THINK HAS ITS BASIS IN ALL OF US IN OUR PLAY HISTORY
StuartBrown_2008P INTO HOW THAT CONNECTS WITH YOUR LIFE NOW
StuartBrown_2008P AND YOU'LL FIND YOU MAY CHANGE JOBS WHICH HAS HAPPENED TO A NUMBER PEOPLE WHEN I'VE HAD THEM DO THIS IN ORDER TO BE MORE EMPOWERED THROUGH THEIR PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P OR YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ENRICH YOUR LIFE BY PRIORITIZING IT AND PAYING ATTENTION TO IT MOST OF US WORK WITH GROUPS AND I
StuartBrown_2008P PUT THIS UP BECAUSE THE D SCHOOL THE DESIGN SCHOOL AT STANFORD THANKS TO DAVID KELLEY AND A LOT OF OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN VISIONARY ABOUT ITS ESTABLISHMENT
StuartBrown_2008P THIS IS OUR MAIDEN VOYAGE IN THIS WE'RE ABOUT TWO AND A HALF THREE MONTHS INTO IT AND IT'S REALLY BEEN FUN THERE IS OUR STAR
StuartBrown_2008P NOBEL PRIZE STUART THOMPSON IN NEUROSCIENCE SO WE'VE HAD BRENDAN WHO 'S FROM IDEO AND THE REST OF US SITTING ASIDE
StuartBrown_2008P AND WATCHING THESE STUDENTS AS THEY PUT PLAY PRINCIPLES INTO PRACTICE IN THE CLASSROOM
StuartBrown_2008P AND ONE OF THEIR PROJECTS WAS TO
StuartBrown_2008P SEE WHAT MAKES MEETINGS BORING
StuartBrown_2008P AND TO TRY AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
StuartBrown_2008P SO WHAT WILL FOLLOW IS A STUDENT MADE FILM ABOUT JUST THAT
StuartBrown_2008P FLOW IS THE MENTAL STATE OF APPARITION IN WHICH THE PERSON IS FULLY IMMERSED IN WHAT HE OR SHE IS DOING CHARACTERIZED BY A FEELING OF ENERGIZED FOCUS FULL INVOLVEMENT AND SUCCESS IN THE PROCESS OF THE ACTIVITY
StuartBrown_2008P AN IMPORTANT KEY INSIGHT THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT MEETINGS IS THAT PEOPLE PACK THEM IN ONE AFTER ANOTHER DISRUPTIVE TO
StuartBrown_2008P TAKE THE MEETING OFF AND HAVE PEACE OF MIND THAT YOU CAN COME BACK TO ME BECAUSE WHEN YOU NEED IT AGAIN
StuartBrown_2008P THE MEETING IS LITERALLY HANGING IN YOUR
StuartBrown_2008P THE WEARABLE MEETING BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT IT ON YOU IMMEDIATELY GET EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO HAVE A FUN AND PRODUCTIVE AND USEFUL MEETING BUT WHEN YOU TAKE IT OFF THAT'S WHEN THE REAL ACTION HAPPENS
StuartBrown_2008P SET ASIDE TIME TO PLAY BUT WHERE YOUR LIFE BECOMES INFUSED MINUTE BY MINUTE HOUR BY HOUR WITH BODY
StuartBrown_2008P OBJECT SOCIAL FANTASY TRANSFORMATIONAL KINDS OF PLAY AND I THINK YOU'LL HAVE A BETTER AND MORE EMPOWERED LIFE THANK YOU
StuartBrown_2008P IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THERE MAY BE SOME TEMPTATION ON THE PART OF PEOPLE TO LOOK AT YOUR WORK AND GO I THINK I'VE HEARD THIS IN MY KIND OF POP PSYCHOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P YEAH I DON'T THINK THAT'S ACCURATE AND I THINK PROBABLY BECAUSE ANIMALS HAVE TAUGHT US THAT IF YOU STOP A CAT FROM PLAYING WHICH YOU CAN DO AND WE'VE ALL SEEN HOW CATS
StuartBrown_2008P AROUND STUFF THEY'RE JUST AS GOOD PREDATORS AS THEY WOULD BE IF THEY HADN'T PLAYED AND IF YOU IMAGINE A KID PRETENDING TO BE
StuartBrown_2008P OR A RACE CAR DRIVER OR A FIREMAN THEY DON'T ALL BECOME RACE CAR DRIVERS
StuartBrown_2008P YOU KNOW SO THERE'S A DISCONNECT BETWEEN PREPARATION FOR THE FUTURE WHICH IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE IN THINKING ABOUT PLAY AS AND THINKING OF IT AS A SEPARATE
StuartBrown_2008P BIOLOGICAL ENTITY AND THIS IS WHERE MY CHASING ANIMALS FOR FOUR FIVE YEARS REALLY CHANGED MY PERSPECTIVE FROM A CLINICIAN TO WHAT I AM NOW
StuartBrown_2008P WHICH IS THAT PLAY HAS A BIOLOGICAL PLACE
StuartBrown_2008P DREAM AND THEY REHEARSE AND THEY DO SOME OTHER THINGS THAT HELP MEMORY AND THAT ARE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF SLEEP AND DREAMING THE NEXT STEP OF EVOLUTION IN MAMMALS AND CREATURES WITH DIVINELY SUPERFLUOUS NEURONS WILL
StuartBrown_2008P AND THE FACT THAT THE POLAR BEAR AND HUSKY OR MAGPIE AND A BEAR OR YOU AND I AND OUR DOGS CAN CROSSOVER AND HAVE THAT
StuartBrown_2008P HOW DO YOU KEEP AND I KNOW YOU'RE PART OF THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH COMMUNITY AND YOU HAVE TO JUSTIFY WITH GRANTS AND PROPOSALS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HOW DO YOU PREVENT AND SOME OF THE DATA THAT YOU'VE PRODUCED THE GOOD SCIENCE THAT
StuartBrown_2008P IS HOT TO HANDLE HOW DO YOU PREVENT EITHER THE MEDIA'S INTERPRETATION OF YOUR WORK OR THE SCIENTIFIC
StuartBrown_2008P THAT PLAY ENHANCES YOUR INTELLIGENCE WELL LET 'S ROUND THESE KIDS UP PUT THEM IN PENS AND MAKE THEM PLAY FOR MONTHS AT A TIME
StuartBrown_2008P THE ONLY WAY I KNOW TO DO IT IS TO HAVE ACCUMULATED THE ADVISERS THAT I HAVE WHO GO FROM PRACTITIONERS WHO CAN ESTABLISH THROUGH IMPROVISATIONAL PLAY OR CLOWNING OR WHATEVER A STATE OF PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P SO PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT'S THERE AND THEN YOU GET AN FMRI SPECIALIST AND YOU GET FRANK WILSON AND YOU GET OTHER KINDS OF HARD SCIENTISTS INCLUDING NEUROENDOCRINOLOGISTS AND YOU GET THEM INTO A
StuartBrown_2008P GROUP TOGETHER FOCUSED ON PLAY
StuartBrown_2008P PRETTY HARD NOT TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY
StuartBrown_2008P LONG TERM AS LEARNING SOME OF THE BASIC THINGS ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH
