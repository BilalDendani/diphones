AuretvanHeerden_2010G BY ARMED GANGS USING CHILD SLAVES WHAT THE U N SECURITY COUNCIL CALLS BLOOD MINERALS THEN TRAVELED INTO SOME COMPONENTS AND ENDED UP IN A FACTORY IN SHINJIN IN CHINA
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THAT FACTORY OVER A DOZEN PEOPLE HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE ALREADY THIS YEAR
AuretvanHeerden_2010G ONE MAN DIED AFTER WORKING A THIRTY SIX
AuretvanHeerden_2010G WE ALL LOVE CHOCOLATE WE BUY IT FOR OUR KIDS EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE COCOA COMES FROM COTE D 'IVOIRE AND GHANA AND IT'S HARVESTED BY CHILDREN
AuretvanHeerden_2010G WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM OF CHILD SLAVES CHILDREN HAVE BEEN TRAFFICKED FROM OTHER CONFLICT ZONES TO COME AND WORK ON THE COFFEE PLANTATIONS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G HEPARIN BLOOD THINNER A PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT STARTS OUT IN ARTISANAL WORKSHOPS LIKE THIS IN CHINA
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THE SECOND BIGGEST EXPORTER OF COTTON ON EARTH EVERY YEAR WHEN IT COMES TO THE COTTON HARVEST THE GOVERNMENT SHUTS DOWN THE SCHOOLS PUTS THE KIDS IN BUSES
AuretvanHeerden_2010G AND ALL OF THOSE PRODUCTS PROBABLY END THEIR LIVES IN A DUMP LIKE THIS ONE IN MANILA THESE PLACES THESE ORIGINS REPRESENT GOVERNANCE GAPS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THAT'S THE POLITEST DESCRIPTION I HAVE FOR THEM THESE ARE THE DARK POOLS WHERE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS BEGIN THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS WHICH BRING US OUR FAVORITE BRAND NAME PRODUCTS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G SOME THESE GOVERNANCE GAPS ARE RUN BY ROGUE STATES
AuretvanHeerden_2010G SOME OF THEM ARE NOT STATES ANYMORE AT ALL THEY'RE FAILED STATES SOME OF THEM ARE JUST COUNTRIES WHO BELIEVE THAT DEREGULATION OR NO REGULATION IS THE BEST WAY TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT PROMOTE TRADE
AuretvanHeerden_2010G NOW I DIDN'T COME HERE TO DEPRESS YOU ABOUT THE STATE OF THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN
AuretvanHeerden_2010G WE NEED A REALITY CHECK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE JUST HOW
AuretvanHeerden_2010G SERIOUS A DEFICIT OF RIGHTS WE HAVE THIS IS AN INDEPENDENT REPUBLIC
AuretvanHeerden_2010G PROBABLY A FAILED STATE IT'S DEFINITELY NOT A DEMOCRATIC STATE
AuretvanHeerden_2010G AND RIGHT NOW THAT INDEPENDENT REPUBLIC OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS NOT BEING GOVERNED IN A WAY THAT WOULD SATISFY US
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THAT WE CAN ENGAGE IN ETHICAL TRADE OR ETHICAL CONSUMPTION
AuretvanHeerden_2010G NOW THAT'S NOT A NEW STORY
AuretvanHeerden_2010G YOU'VE SEEN THE DOCUMENTARIES OF SWEATSHOPS MAKING GARMENTS ALL OVER THE WORLD EVEN IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES YOU WANT TO SEE THE CLASSIC SWEATSHOP MEET ME AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN THE STREET AND I'LL SHOW YOU A CHINESE
AuretvanHeerden_2010G BUT TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF HEPARIN
AuretvanHeerden_2010G YOU EXPECT THAT THE SUPPLY CHAIN THAT GETS IT TO THE HOSPITAL PROBABLY SQUEAKY CLEAN
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IN THERE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER COMES FROM PIGS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G AND WHEN THEIR FACTORY IN CHINA WHICH PROBABLY IS PRETTY CLEAN IS GETTING ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS FROM BACKYARD
AuretvanHeerden_2010G SOME OF THE SUPPLIERS REALIZED THAT THEY COULD SUBSTITUTE A PRODUCT
AuretvanHeerden_2010G WHICH MIMICKED HEPARIN IN
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THE ANSWER IS QUITE SIMPLE
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THE CHINESE DEFINE THESE FACILITIES AS CHEMICAL FACILITIES NOT PHARMACEUTICAL FACILITIES SO
AuretvanHeerden_2010G AND THE U S FDA HAS A JURISDICTIONAL PROBLEM THIS IS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G FIVE HUNDRED OF THESE FACILITIES PRODUCING ACTIVE INGREDIENTS IN CHINA
AuretvanHeerden_2010G IN FACT ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS IN MEDICINES NOW COME FROM OFFSHORE PARTICULARLY CHINA AND INDIA
AuretvanHeerden_2010G AND WE DON'T HAVE A GOVERNANCE SYSTEM WE DON'T HAVE A REGULATORY SYSTEM ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THAT PRODUCTION
AuretvanHeerden_2010G WE DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS BASIC DIGNITY ARE ENSURED
AuretvanHeerden_2010G SO AT A NATIONAL LEVEL
AuretvanHeerden_2010G AND WE WORK IN ABOUT SIXTY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AT A NATIONAL LEVEL WE'VE GOT A SERIOUS BREAKDOWN IN THE ABILITY OF GOVERNMENTS TO REGULATE
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THE REAL PROBLEM WITH THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN IS THAT IT'S SUPRANATIONAL
AuretvanHeerden_2010G SO GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE FAILING WHO ARE DROPPING THE BALL
AuretvanHeerden_2010G AT A NATIONAL LEVEL HAVE EVEN LESS ABILITY TO GET THEIR ARMS AROUND THE PROBLEM AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL AND YOU CAN JUST LOOK AT THE HEADLINES TAKE COPENHAGEN LAST YEAR
AuretvanHeerden_2010G COMPLETE FAILURE OF GOVERNMENTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING IN THE FACE OF AN INTERNATIONAL CHALLENGE TAKE THE G TWENTY MEETING A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
AuretvanHeerden_2010G STEPPED BACK FROM ITS COMMITMENTS OF JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO
AuretvanHeerden_2010G YOU CAN TAKE ANY ONE OF THE MAJOR GLOBAL
AuretvanHeerden_2010G SIMPLE ANSWER IS THEY CAN 'T THEY'RE NATIONAL
AuretvanHeerden_2010G VOTERS ARE LOCAL
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THEY HAVE PAROCHIAL INTERESTS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THEY CAN'T SUBORDINATE THOSE INTERESTS TO THE GREATER GLOBAL PUBLIC GOOD
AuretvanHeerden_2010G SO IF WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE THE DELIVERY OF THE KEY PUBLIC GOODS AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL
AuretvanHeerden_2010G IN THIS CASE IN THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN
AuretvanHeerden_2010G WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT MECHANISM WE NEED A DIFFERENT MACHINE
AuretvanHeerden_2010G FORTUNATELY WE HAVE SOME EXAMPLES
AuretvanHeerden_2010G IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THERE WERE A WHOLE SERIES OF SCANDALS CONCERNING THE PRODUCTION OF BRAND NAME GOODS IN THE U S CHILD LABOR FORCED LABOR SERIOUS HEALTH AND SAFETY ABUSES
AuretvanHeerden_2010G HOW TO PREVENT THAT BUT I'M AT LEAST GOING TO USE MY GOOD OFFICES TO GET YOU FOLKS TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH A RESPONSE
AuretvanHeerden_2010G SO THEY FORMED A WHITE HOUSE TASK FORCE AND THEY SPENT ABOUT THREE YEARS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G ARGUING ABOUT WHO TAKES HOW MUCH RESPONSIBILITY IN THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN COMPANIES DIDN'T FEEL IT WAS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THOSE FACILITIES THEY DON'T EMPLOY THOSE WORKERS THEY'RE NOT LEGALLY LIABLE
AuretvanHeerden_2010G AGREED OKAY WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE AGREE ON A COMMON SET OF STANDARDS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G MAKE IT PART OF THE CONTRACT AND THAT WAS A STROKE OF ABSOLUTE GENIUS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G BECAUSE WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY HARNESSED THE POWER OF THE CONTRACT PRIVATE POWER TO DELIVER PUBLIC GOODS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G AND LET 'S FACE IT THE CONTRACT FROM A MAJOR MULTINATIONAL BRAND TO A SUPPLIER IN INDIA OR CHINA HAS MUCH MORE PERSUASIVE VALUE THAN THE LOCAL LABOR LAW THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS THE LOCAL HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THOSE FACTORIES WILL PROBABLY NEVER
AuretvanHeerden_2010G BE AMAZING IF THEY WERE ABLE TO
AuretvanHeerden_2010G EVEN IF THEY DID THEIR JOBS AND THEY CITED THOSE FACILITIES FOR THEIR VIOLATIONS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THE FINE WOULD BE DERISORY BUT YOU LOSE THAT CONTRACT FOR A MAJOR BRAND NAME THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STAYING IN BUSINESS OR GOING BANKRUPT
AuretvanHeerden_2010G MAKES A DIFFERENCE SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO IS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HARNESS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THE POWER AND THE INFLUENCE OF THE ONLY TRULY TRANSNATIONAL INSTITUTION IN THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THAT OF THE MULTINATIONAL COMPANY AND GET THEM TO DO THE RIGHT THING
AuretvanHeerden_2010G GET THEM TO USE THAT POWER FOR GOOD TO DELIVER THE KEY PUBLIC GOODS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G NOW OF COURSE THIS DOESN'T COME NATURALLY TO MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES THEY WEREN'T SET UP TO DO THIS THEY'RE SET UP TO MAKE MONEY
AuretvanHeerden_2010G BUT THEY ARE EXTREMELY EFFICIENT ORGANIZATIONS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THEY HAVE RESOURCES AND IF WE CAN ADD THE WILL THE COMMITMENT THEY KNOW HOW TO DELIVER THAT PRODUCT
AuretvanHeerden_2010G NOW GETTING THERE IS NOT EASY THOSE SUPPLY CHAINS I PUT UP ON THE SCREEN EARLIER THEY'RE NOT
AuretvanHeerden_2010G SAFE SPACE YOU NEED A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN COME TOGETHER
AuretvanHeerden_2010G SIT DOWN WITHOUT FEAR OF JUDGMENT WITHOUT RECRIMINATION
AuretvanHeerden_2010G TO ACTUALLY FACE THE PROBLEM AGREE ON THE PROBLEM AND COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS WE CAN DO IT THE TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS ARE THERE THE PROBLEM IS THE LACK OF TRUST THE LACK OF CONFIDENCE THE LACK OF PARTNERSHIP
AuretvanHeerden_2010G BETWEEN NGO 'S CAMPAIGN GROUPS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G WE CAN PUT THOSE TWO TOGETHER IN A SAFE SPACE
AuretvanHeerden_2010G GET THEM TO WORK TOGETHER WE CAN DELIVER PUBLIC GOODS RIGHT NOW OR IN EXTREMELY SHORT SUPPLY
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THIS IS A RADICAL PROPOSITION
AuretvanHeerden_2010G AND IT'S CRAZY TO THINK THAT IF YOU'RE FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BANGLADESHI GIRL
AuretvanHeerden_2010G LEAVING YOUR RURAL VILLAGE TO GO AND WORK IN A FACTORY IN DHAKA
AuretvanHeerden_2010G CRAZY MULTINATIONALS ARE PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G I KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE DISBELIEF YOU'LL SAY HOW CAN WE TRUST
AuretvanHeerden_2010G WELL WE
AuretvanHeerden_2010G AND THEN WE PUBLISH THE RESULTS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G YOU CAN CALL YOURSELF RESPONSIBLE BUT RESPONSIBILITY WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY OFTEN DOESN'T WORK
AuretvanHeerden_2010G NEED TO BELIEVE ME YOU SHOULDN 'T BELIEVE ME GO TO THE WEBSITE LOOK AT THE AUDIT RESULTS ASK YOURSELF IS THIS COMPANY BEHAVING
AuretvanHeerden_2010G IN A SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE WAY CAN I BUY THAT PRODUCT WITHOUT COMPROMISING MY ETHICS THAT'S THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G I HATE THE IDEA THAT GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD
AuretvanHeerden_2010G I HATE THE IDEA THAT GOVERNMENTS HAVE DROPPED THIS BALL AND I CAN'T GET USED TO THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW WE CAN'T GET THEM TO DO THEIR JOBS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G I'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR THIRTY YEARS AND IN THAT TIME I'VE SEEN THE ABILITY THE COMMITMENT THE WILL OF GOVERNMENT TO DO THIS DECLINE AND I DON'T SEE THEM MAKING A COMEBACK RIGHT NOW
AuretvanHeerden_2010G SO WE STARTED OUT THINKING THIS WAS A STOPGAP MEASURE
AuretvanHeerden_2010G COMPANIES AND NGO 'S ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GET TOGETHER TO FACE THE MAJOR CHALLENGES WE ARE GOING TO FACE JUST LOOK AT PANDEMICS SWINE FLU BIRD FLU H ONE N ONE
AuretvanHeerden_2010G LOOK AT THE HEALTH SYSTEMS IN SO MANY COUNTRIES DO THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO FACE UP TO A SERIOUS PANDEMIC
AuretvanHeerden_2010G COULD THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND NGO 'S GET TOGETHER AND MARSHAL A RESPONSE ABSOLUTELY
AuretvanHeerden_2010G WHAT THEY LACK IS THAT SAFE SPACE TO COME TOGETHER AGREE AND MOVE TO ACTION
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE
AuretvanHeerden_2010G AS WELL THAT THIS OFTEN SEEMS LIKE OVERWHELMING LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR PEOPLE TO
AuretvanHeerden_2010G YOU WANT ME TO DELIVER HUMAN RIGHTS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G IT SEEMS TOO DAUNTING TOO DANGEROUS FOR ANY COMPANY TO TAKE ON
AuretvanHeerden_2010G BUT THERE ARE COMPANIES WE HAVE FOUR THOUSAND COMPANIES WHO ARE MEMBERS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G SOME OF THEM ARE VERY VERY LARGE COMPANIES THE SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE AND HAVE DONE IT
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THE EXAMPLE THE ROLE MODEL
AuretvanHeerden_2010G AND WHENEVER WE DISCUSS ONE OF THESE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS CHILD LABOR IN COTTONSEED FARMS IN INDIA THIS YEAR WE WILL MONITOR FIFTY THOUSAND COTTONSEED FARMS IN INDIA
AuretvanHeerden_2010G IT SEEMS OVERWHELMING THE NUMBERS JUST MAKE YOU
AuretvanHeerden_2010G BUT WE BREAK IT DOWN TO SOME BASIC REALITIES AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMES DOWN TO A VERY SIMPLE PROPOSITION CAN I GIVE THIS PERSON THEIR DIGNITY BACK
AuretvanHeerden_2010G POOR PEOPLE PEOPLE WHOSE HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THE CRUX OF THAT IS THE LOSS OF DIGNITY THE LACK OF
AuretvanHeerden_2010G IT STARTS WITH JUST GIVING PEOPLE BACK THEIR DIGNITY
AuretvanHeerden_2010G I WAS SITTING IN A SLUM OUTSIDE GURGAON JUST NEXT TO DELHI ONE OF THE
AuretvanHeerden_2010G FLASHIEST BRIGHTEST NEW CITIES POPPING UP IN INDIA RIGHT NOW AND I WAS TALKING TO WORKERS WHO WORKED IN GARMENT SWEATSHOPS DOWN THE ROAD AND I ASKED THEM WHAT MESSAGE THEY WOULD LIKE ME TO TAKE THE BRANDS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THEY DIDN'T SAY MONEY THEY SAID THE PEOPLE WHO EMPLOY US TREAT US LIKE WE ARE LESS THAN HUMAN
AuretvanHeerden_2010G PLEASE ASK THEM TO TREAT US LIKE HUMAN BEINGS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G THAT'S MY SIMPLE UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN RIGHTS
AuretvanHeerden_2010G IN THIS ROOM EVERYBODY OUT THERE WE CAN ALL MAKE A DECISION TO COME TOGETHER AND PICK UP THE BALLS AND RUN WITH THE BALLS THAT GOVERNMENTS HAVE DROPPED IF WE DON'T DO IT
AuretvanHeerden_2010G WE'RE ABANDONING HOPE WE'RE ABANDONING OUR ESSENTIAL HUMANITY
