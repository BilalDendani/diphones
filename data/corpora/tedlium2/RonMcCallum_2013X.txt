RonMcCallum_2013X@13.84:30.67 THREE OR FOUR YEARS OLD I REMEMBER MY MUM READING A STORY TO ME AND MY TWO BIG BROTHERS AND I REMEMBER PUTTING UP MY HANDS TO FEEL THE PAGE OF THE BOOK TO FEEL THE PICTURE THEY WERE DISCUSSING
RonMcCallum_2013X@52.55:57.65 THAT I WOULD BE PART OF A TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION THAT WOULD MAKE THAT DREAM COME TRUE
RonMcCallum_2013X@58.79:64.27 I WAS BORN PREMATURE BY ABOUT TEN WEEKS WHICH RESULTED IN MY BLINDNESS
RonMcCallum_2013X@64.51:66.63 SOME SIXTY FOUR YEARS AGO
RonMcCallum_2013X@66.79:72.47 THE CONDITION IS KNOWN AS RETROLENTAL FIBROPLASIA AND IT 'S NOW VERY RARE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD
RonMcCallum_2013X@86.67:90.64 THAT I WAS IN A COUNTRY WHERE I COULD PARTICIPATE
RonMcCallum_2013X@90.76:96 IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION THERE ARE THIRTY SEVEN
RonMcCallum_2013X@96:107.91 MILLION TOTALLY BLIND PEOPLE ON OUR PLANET BUT THOSE OF US WHO 'VE SHARED IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES MAINLY COME FROM NORTH AMERICA EUROPE JAPAN AND OTHER DEVELOPED PARTS OF THE WORLD
RonMcCallum_2013X@109.6:118.2 COMPUTERS HAVE CHANGED THE LIVES OF US ALL IN THIS ROOM AND AROUND THE WORLD BUT I THINK THEY 'VE CHANGED THE LIVES OF WE BLIND PEOPLE MORE THAN ANY OTHER GROUP
RonMcCallum_2013X@118.78:129.63 AND SO I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN COMPUTER BASED ADAPTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND THE MANY VOLUNTEERS WHO HELPED ME OVER THE YEARS
RonMcCallum_2013X@130.06:132.8 TO BECOME THE PERSON I AM TODAY
RonMcCallum_2013X@189.62:201.72 THE BOOKS WERE TRANSCRIBED BY TRANSCRIBERS VOLUNTARY PEOPLE WHO PUNCHED ONE DOT AT A TIME SO I 'D HAVE VOLUMES TO READ AND THAT HAD BEEN GOING ON MAINLY BY WOMEN SINCE THE LATE NINETEEN
RonMcCallum_2013X@205.38:207.14 WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL
RonMcCallum_2013X@207.36:220.24 I GOT MY FIRST PHILIPS REEL TO REEL TAPE RECORDER AND TAPE RECORDERS BECAME MY SORT OF PRE COMPUTER MEDIUM OF LEARNING I COULD HAVE FAMILY AND FRIENDS READ ME MATERIAL
RonMcCallum_2013X@220.28:222.24 AND I COULD THEN READ IT BACK
RonMcCallum_2013X@222.42:234.98 AS MANY TIMES AS I NEEDED AND IT BROUGHT ME INTO CONTACT WITH VOLUNTEERS AND HELPERS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I STUDIED AT GRADUATE SCHOOL AT QUEEN 'S UNIVERSITY IN CANADA
RonMcCallum_2013X@258.23:261.22 IN LAW BY THEIR DEDICATED HELP
RonMcCallum_2013X@271.21:274.12 TAPE RECORDERS WERE EVERYTHING TO ME
RonMcCallum_2013X@274.12:278.4 IN FACT IN MY OFFICE IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY I HAD EIGHTEEN MILES
RonMcCallum_2013X@296.01:304.38 ONE OF THE REASONS I AGREED TO GIVE THIS TALK TODAY WAS THAT I WAS HOPING THAT LOIS WOULD BE HERE SO I COULD INTRODUCE YOU TO HER AND PUBLICLY THANK HER
RonMcCallum_2013X@325.87:329.01 I SAW MY FIRST
RonMcCallum_2013X@338.26:351.53 HOW VERY WRONG I WAS IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN IN THE MONTH OUR ELDEST SON GERARD WAS BORN I GOT MY FIRST BLIND COMPUTER AND IT 'S ACTUALLY HERE
RonMcCallum_2013X@387.1:403.13 IT WAS INVENTED BY RUSSELL SMITH A PASSIONATE INVENTOR IN NEW ZEALAND WHO WAS TRYING TO HELP BLIND PEOPLE SADLY HE DIED IN A LIGHT PLANE CRASH IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE BUT HIS MEMORY LIVES ON IN MY HEART IT MEANT FOR THE FIRST TIME I COULD READ BACK
RonMcCallum_2013X@439.68:449.16 BUT BY USING CHARGE COUPLED DEVICE FLATBED SCANNERS AND SPEECH SYNTHESIZERS HE DEVELOPED A MACHINE THAT COULD READ ANY FONT
RonMcCallum_2013X@449.56:453.25 AND HIS MACHINE WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A WASHING MACHINE
RonMcCallum_2013X@475.22:483.07 FOR THE FIRST TIME I COULD READ WHAT I WANTED TO READ BY PUTTING A BOOK ON THE SCANNER I DIDN 'T HAVE TO BE NICE TO PEOPLE
RonMcCallum_2013X@485.78:488.98 I NO LONGER WOULD BE CENSORED FOR EXAMPLE
RonMcCallum_2013X@489.49:496.43 I WAS TOO SHY THEN AND I 'M ACTUALLY TOO SHY NOW TO ASK ANYBODY TO READ ME OUT LOUD SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL
RonMcCallum_2013X@500.36:503.87 BUT YOU KNOW I COULD POP A BOOK ON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
RonMcCallum_2013X@514.63:518.48 THE KURZWEIL READER IS SIMPLY A PROGRAM ON MY LAPTOP
RonMcCallum_2013X@533.44:536.8 ONE IS ANOTHER AMERICAN INVENTOR TED HENTER
RonMcCallum_2013X@536.87:539.36 TED WAS A MOTORCYCLE RACER
RonMcCallum_2013X@547.31:559.41 HE THEN TURNED TO BEING A WATERSKIER AND WAS A CHAMPION DISABLED WATERSKIER BUT IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE HE TEAMED UP WITH BILL JOYCE TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM
RonMcCallum_2013X@584.8:592.56 YOU SEE IF I READ LIKE THAT I 'D FALL ASLEEP I SLOWED IT DOWN FOR YOU I 'M GOING TO ASK THAT WE PLAY IT AT THE SPEED I READ IT CAN WE PLAY THAT ONE
RonMcCallum_2013X@609.73:612.59 YOU KNOW WHEN YOU 'RE MARKING STUDENT ESSAYS YOU WANT TO GET THROUGH
RonMcCallum_2013X@630.6:632.46 BUT YOU KNOW I FIND
RonMcCallum_2013X@632.46:635.77 READING WITH MACHINES A VERY LONELY PROCESS
RonMcCallum_2013X@636.82:642.79 I GREW UP WITH FAMILY FRIENDS READING TO ME AND I LOVED THE WARMTH
RonMcCallum_2013X@643.32:653.77 AND THE BREATH AND THE CLOSENESS OF PEOPLE READING DO YOU LOVE BEING READ TO AND ONE OF MY MOST ENDURING MEMORIES IS IN ONE THOUSAND NINE
RonMcCallum_2013X@659.27:673.69 HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER 'S STONE ISN 'T THAT A GREAT BOOK I STILL LOVE BEING CLOSE TO SOMEONE READING TO ME BUT I WOULDN 'T GIVE UP THE TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE IT 'S ALLOWED ME TO LEAD A GREAT LIFE
RonMcCallum_2013X@675.42:681.82 OF COURSE TALKING BOOKS FOR THE BLIND PREDATED ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY AFTER ALL THE LONG PLAYING RECORD
RonMcCallum_2013X@722.21:740.13 W THREE C HAS DEVELOPED WORLDWIDE STANDARDS FOR THE INTERNET AND WE WANT ALL INTERNET USERS OR INTERNET SITE OWNERS TO MAKE THEIR SITES COMPATIBLE SO THAT WE PERSONS WITHOUT VISION CAN HAVE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD
RonMcCallum_2013X@740.45:744.2 THERE ARE OTHER BARRIERS BROUGHT ABOUT BY OUR LAWS
RonMcCallum_2013X@753.88:755.74 OR READ FOR WE BLIND PERSONS
RonMcCallum_2013X@756.33:758.96 BUT THOSE BOOKS CAN 'T TRAVEL ACROSS BORDERS
RonMcCallum_2013X@759.55:766.53 FOR EXAMPLE IN SPAIN THERE ARE A ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACCESSIBLE BOOKS IN SPANISH IN ARGENTINA THERE ARE FIFTY THOUSAND
RonMcCallum_2013X@766.77:770.39 IN NO OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY ARE THERE MORE THAN A COUPLE OF THOUSAND
RonMcCallum_2013X@770.48:774.54 BUT IT 'S NOT LEGAL TO TRANSPORT THE BOOKS FROM SPAIN TO LATIN AMERICA
RonMcCallum_2013X@774.68:789.75 THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACCESSIBLE BOOKS IN THE UNITED STATES BRITAIN CANADA AUSTRALIA ETC BUT THEY CAN 'T BE TRANSPORTED TO THE SIXTY COUNTRIES IN OUR WORLD WHERE ENGLISH IS THE FIRST AND THE SECOND LANGUAGE AND REMEMBER I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT HARRY POTTER
RonMcCallum_2013X@790.2:805.55 WELL BECAUSE WE CAN 'T TRANSPORT BOOKS ACROSS BORDERS THERE HAD TO BE SEPARATE VERSIONS READ IN ALL THE DIFFERENT ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES BRITAIN UNITED STATES CANADA AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND ALL HAD TO HAVE SEPARATE READINGS OF HARRY POTTER
RonMcCallum_2013X@805.73:817.2 AND THAT 'S WHY NEXT MONTH IN MOROCCO A MEETING IS TAKING PLACE BETWEEN ALL THE COUNTRIES IT 'S SOMETHING THAT A GROUP OF COUNTRIES AND THE WORLD BLIND UNION ARE ADVOCATING A CROSS BORDER TREATY
RonMcCallum_2013X@817.2:829.39 SO THAT IF BOOKS ARE AVAILABLE UNDER A COPYRIGHT EXCEPTION AND THE OTHER COUNTRY HAS A COPYRIGHT EXCEPTION WE CAN TRANSPORT THOSE BOOKS ACROSS BORDERS AND GIVE LIFE TO PEOPLE PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BLIND PEOPLE
RonMcCallum_2013X@829.66:831.77 WHO DON 'T HAVE THE BOOKS TO READ
RonMcCallum_2013X@842.43:848.18 MY LIFE HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY BLESSED WITH MARRIAGE AND CHILDREN
RonMcCallum_2013X@848.54:850.85 AND CERTAINLY INTERESTING WORK TO DO
RonMcCallum_2013X@861.98:865.63 I 'VE INDEED BEEN A VERY FORTUNATE HUMAN BEING
RonMcCallum_2013X@867.44:869.91 I WONDER WHAT THE FUTURE WILL HOLD
RonMcCallum_2013X@870.18:873.12 THE TECHNOLOGY WILL ADVANCE EVEN FURTHER
RonMcCallum_2013X@874.1:878.77 BUT I CAN STILL REMEMBER MY MUM SAYING SIXTY YEARS AGO REMEMBER DARLING
RonMcCallum_2013X@879.2:883.1 YOU 'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO READ THE PRINT WITH YOUR FINGERS
RonMcCallum_2013X@897.84:911.56 I 'D LIKE TO THANK MY RESEARCHER HANNAH MARTIN WHO IS MY SLIDE CLICKER WHO CLICKS THE SLIDES AND MY WIFE PROFESSOR MARY CROCK WHO 'S THE LIGHT OF MY LIFE IS COMING ON TO COLLECT ME I WANT TO THANK HER TOO
RonMcCallum_2013X@911.56:915.25 I THINK I HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE NOW BLESS YOU THANK YOU VERY
