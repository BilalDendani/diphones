JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE IN BRAZIL IS ONE OF THE MAJOR THREATS AGAINST OUR FAUNA ESPECIALLY BIRDS
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U AND MAINLY TO SUPPLY THE PET MARKET WITH THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS TAKEN FROM NATURE EVERY MONTH
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U THESE HUGE CARGOS WITH LIVE ANIMALS INTENDED TO SUPPLY THE PET MARKET OR THEY SEIZE THE ANIMALS DIRECTLY FROM THE PEOPLE 'S HOUSES
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U AND THIS IS HOW WE END UP EVERY MONTH WITH THOUSANDS OF SEIZED ANIMALS AND FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS WITH THEM WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U IN THE EYES OF MANY PEOPLE AFTER THE ANIMALS ARE SEIZED THEY SAY YAY JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U THE GOOD GUYS ARRIVED TOOK THE CUTE MISTREATED ANIMALS FROM THE HANDS OF THE EVIL TRAFFICKERS AND
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U IN BRAZIL THEY ARE USUALLY FIRST SENT TO GOVERNMENTAL TRIAGE FACILITIES IN WHICH MOST OF THE CASES THE CONDITIONS ARE AS BAD AS WITH THE TRAFFICKERS
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THESE CENTERS RECIEVED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND ANIMALS OF WHICH THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND WERE BIRDS
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U AND THE POLICE ESTIMATES THAT WE SEIZE FIVE PERCENT OF WHAT'S BEING TRAFFICKED SOME LUCKY ONES AND AMONG THEM BRAD GO TO SERIOUS REHABILITATION CENTERS AFTER THAT
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U IN THESE PLACES THEY ARE CARED FOR THEY TRAIN THEIR FLYING THEY LEARN HOW TO RECOGNIZE THE FOOD THEY WILL FIND IN NATURE AND THEY ARE ABLE TO SOCIALIZE WITH OTHERS FROM THE SAME SPECIES
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U BUT THEN WHAT THE BRAZIL ORNITHOLOGICAL SOCIETY SO NOW WE'RE TALKING ONLY BIRDS
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U CLAIMS THAT WE HAVE TOO LITTLE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE SPECIES IN NATURE THEREFORE IT WOULD BE TOO RISKY TO RELEASE THESE ANIMALS
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U BOTH FOR THE RELEASED AND FOR THE NATURAL POPULATIONS THEY ALSO CLAIM THAT WE SPEND TOO MANY RESOURCES
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U BUT SOME RESEARCHERS MYSELF INCLUDED SOME NGOS AND SOME PEOPLE FROM THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT BELIEVE THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U WE THINK THAT IF AND WHEN THE ANIMALS MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA CONCERNING THEIR HEALTH BEHAVIOR INFERRED ORIGIN
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U AND WHATEVER WE KNOW ABOUT THE NATURAL POPULATIONS THEN TECHNICALLY RESPONSIBLE RELEASES ARE POSSIBLE BOTH FOR THE WELL BEING
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U AND FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THE SPECIES AND THEIR ECOSYSTEMS BECAUSE WE WILL BE RETURNING GENES FOR THESE POPULATIONS WHICH COULD BE IMPORTANT FOR THEM
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U IN FACING ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES AND ALSO WE COULD BE RETURNING POTENTIAL SEED DISPERSERS PREDATORS
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U PREYS ETC ALL OF THESE WERE RELEASED BY US ON THE TOP THE TURTLES ARE JUST ENJOYING FREEDOM
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U THE MIDDLE THIS GUY NESTED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER THE RELEASE AND ON THE BOTTOM MY PERSONAL FAVORITE
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U MALE OVER THERE FOUR HOURS AFTER HIS RELEASE HE WAS TOGETHER WITH A WILD FEMALE
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U SO THIS IS NOT NEW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS AROUND THE WORLD BUT IT'S STILL A BIG ISSUE IN BRAZIL WE BELIEVE WE HAVE PERFORMED RESPONSIBLE RELEASES WE'VE REGISTERED RELEASED ANIMALS MATING IN
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U HAVING CHICKS SO THESE GENES ARE INDEED GOING BACK TO THE POPULATIONS HOWEVER THIS IS STILL A MINORITY FOR THE VERY LACK OF KNOWLEDGE
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U SO I SAY LET 'S STUDY MORE LET 'S SHED LIGHT ON THIS ISSUE LET 'S DO WHATEVER WE CAN I'M DEVOTING MY CAREER TO THAT AND I'M HERE TO URGE
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU TO DO WHATEVER IS IN YOUR REACH TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBOR TEACH YOUR CHILDREN MAKE SURE YOUR PET IS FROM A LEGAL BREEDER
JulianaMachadoFerreira_2010U WE NEED TO ACT AND ACT NOW BEFORE THESE ONES ARE THE ONLY ONES LEFT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
