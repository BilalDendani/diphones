JasonPontin_2013U WE USED TO SOLVE
JasonPontin_2013U BIG PROBLEMS
JasonPontin_2013U ON JULY TWENTY FIRST ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE BUZZ ALDRIN CLIMBED OUT OF APOLLO ELEVEN 'S LUNAR MODULE AND DESCENDED ONTO THE SEA OF TRANQUILITY
JasonPontin_2013U ARMSTRONG AND ALDRIN WERE ALONE BUT THEIR PRESENCE ON THE MOON 'S GRAY SURFACE WAS THE CULMINATION OF A CONVULSIVE
JasonPontin_2013U COLLECTIVE EFFORT
JasonPontin_2013U THE APOLLO PROGRAM WAS THE GREATEST PEACETIME MOBILIZATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES
JasonPontin_2013U TO GET TO THE MOON NASA SPENT AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY BILLION DOLLARS IN TODAY 'S MONEY OR FOUR PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL BUDGET APOLLO EMPLOYED AROUND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AND DEMANDED THE COLLABORATION OF TWENTY THOUSAND COMPANIES UNIVERSITIES AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES
JasonPontin_2013U PEOPLE DIED INCLUDING THE CREW OF APOLLO ONE
JasonPontin_2013U WHY DID THEY GO THEY DIDN 'T BRING MUCH BACK EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE POUNDS OF OLD ROCKS AND SOMETHING ALL TWENTY FOUR LATER EMPHASIZED
JasonPontin_2013U WHY CHOOSE THIS AS OUR GOAL
JasonPontin_2013U AND THEY MAY WELL ASK WHY CLIMB THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN WHY THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO FLY THE ATLANTIC WHY DOES
JasonPontin_2013U THEY WENT BECAUSE IT WAS A BIG THING TO DO
JasonPontin_2013U LANDING ON THE MOON OCCURRED IN THE CONTEXT OF A LONG SERIES OF TECHNOLOGICAL TRIUMPHS THE FIRST HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY PRODUCED THE ASSEMBLY LINE AND THE AIRPLANE PENICILLIN AND A VACCINE FOR TUBERCULOSIS IN THE MIDDLE YEARS OF THE CENTURY POLIO WAS ERADICATED AND SMALLPOX ELIMINATED
JasonPontin_2013U TECHNOLOGY ITSELF SEEMED TO POSSESS WHAT ALVIN TOFFLER IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY CALLED ACCELERATIVE THRUST
JasonPontin_2013U FOR MOST OF HUMAN HISTORY WE COULD GO NO FASTER THAN A HORSE OR A BOAT WITH A SAIL BUT IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE THE CREW OF APOLLO TEN FLEW AT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES AN HOUR
JasonPontin_2013U SINCE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NO HUMAN BEINGS HAVE BEEN BACK TO THE MOON NO ONE HAS TRAVELED FASTER THAN THE CREW OF APOLLO TEN
JasonPontin_2013U AND BLITHE OPTIMISM ABOUT TECHNOLOGY 'S POWERS HAS EVAPORATED AS BIG PROBLEMS WE HAD IMAGINED TECHNOLOGY WOULD SOLVE SUCH AS GOING TO MARS CREATING CLEAN ENERGY CURING CANCER OR FEEDING THE WORLD HAVE COME TO SEEM INTRACTABLY HARD
JasonPontin_2013U I REMEMBER WATCHING THE LIFTOFF OF APOLLO SEVENTEEN I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD AND MY MOTHER TOLD ME NOT TO STARE AT THE FIERY EXHAUST OF A SATURN V ROCKET
JasonPontin_2013U I VAGUELY KNEW THIS WAS TO BE THE LAST OF THE MOON MISSIONS BUT I WAS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THERE WOULD BE MARS COLONIES IN MY LIFETIME
JasonPontin_2013U SO SOMETHING HAPPENED TO OUR CAPACITY TO SOLVE BIG PROBLEMS WITH TECHNOLOGY HAS BECOME A COMMONPLACE YOU HEAR IT ALL THE TIME WE 'VE HEARD IT OVER THE LAST TWO DAYS HERE AT TED
JasonPontin_2013U IT FEELS AS IF TECHNOLOGISTS HAVE DIVERTED US AND ENRICHED THEMSELVES WITH TRIVIAL TOYS WITH THINGS LIKE IPHONES AND APPS AND SOCIAL MEDIA OR ALGORITHMS
JasonPontin_2013U THAT SPEED AUTOMATED TRADING THERE 'S NOTHING WRONG WITH MOST OF THESE THINGS THEY 'VE EXPANDED AND ENRICHED OUR LIVES BUT THEY DON 'T SOLVE HUMANITY 'S BIG PROBLEMS
JasonPontin_2013U SILICON VALLEY SAYS THE MARKETS ARE TO BLAME IN PARTICULAR THE INCENTIVES THAT VENTURE CAPITALISTS OFFER TO ENTREPRENEURS SILICON VALLEY SAYS THAT VENTURE INVESTING SHIFTED AWAY FROM
JasonPontin_2013U FUNDING TRANSFORMATIONAL IDEAS AND TOWARDS FUNDING INCREMENTAL PROBLEMS OR EVEN FAKE PROBLEMS BUT I DON 'T THINK THAT EXPLANATION IS GOOD ENOUGH
JasonPontin_2013U IT MOSTLY EXPLAINS WHAT 'S WRONG WITH SILICON VALLEY
JasonPontin_2013U EVEN WHEN VENTURE CAPITALISTS WERE AT THEIR MOST RISK HAPPY THEY PREFERRED SMALL INVESTMENTS TINY INVESTMENTS THAT OFFERED AN EXIT WITHIN TEN YEARS
JasonPontin_2013U AND V C S HAVE NEVER NEVER FUNDED THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES MEANT TO SOLVE BIG PROBLEMS THAT POSSESS NO IMMEDIATE COMMERCIAL VALUE
JasonPontin_2013U NO THE REASONS WE CAN 'T SOLVE BIG PROBLEMS ARE MORE COMPLICATED AND MORE PROFOUND
JasonPontin_2013U SOMETIMES WE CHOOSE NOT TO SOLVE BIG PROBLEMS WE COULD GO TO MARS IF WE WANT NASA EVEN HAS THE OUTLINE OF A PLAN
JasonPontin_2013U BUT GOING TO MARS WOULD FOLLOW A POLITICAL DECISION WITH POPULAR APPEAL AND THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN WE WON 'T GO TO MARS BECAUSE EVERYONE THINKS THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO HERE ON EARTH
JasonPontin_2013U SOMETIMES WE CAN 'T SOLVE BIG PROBLEMS BECAUSE OUR POLITICAL SYSTEMS FAIL
JasonPontin_2013U TODAY LESS THAN TWO PERCENT OF THE WORLD 'S ENERGY CONSUMPTION DERIVES FROM ADVANCED RENEWABLE SOURCES SUCH AS SOLAR WIND AND BIOFUELS
JasonPontin_2013U LESS THAN TWO PERCENT AND THE REASON IS PURELY ECONOMIC COAL AND NATURAL GAS ARE CHEAPER THAN SOLAR AND WIND AND PETROLEUM IS CHEAPER THAN BIOFUELS WE WANT ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES THAT CAN COMPETE ON PRICE NONE EXIST NOW
JasonPontin_2013U TECHNOLOGISTS BUSINESS LEADERS AND ECONOMISTS ALL BASICALLY AGREE ON WHAT NATIONAL POLICIES AND INTERNATIONAL TREATIES WOULD SPUR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY MOSTLY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SOME KIND OF PRICE ON CARBON
JasonPontin_2013U BUT THERE 'S NO HOPE IN THE PRESENT POLITICAL CLIMATE THAT WE WILL SEE U S ENERGY POLICY OR INTERNATIONAL TREATIES THAT REFLECT THAT CONSENSUS
JasonPontin_2013U SOMETIMES BIG PROBLEMS THAT HAD SEEMED TECHNOLOGICAL TURN OUT NOT TO BE SO
JasonPontin_2013U FAMINES WERE LONG UNDERSTOOD TO BE CAUSED BY FAILURES IN FOOD SUPPLY BUT THIRTY YEARS OF RESEARCH HAVE TAUGHT US THAT FAMINES ARE POLITICAL CRISES THAT CATASTROPHICALLY AFFECT FOOD DISTRIBUTION
JasonPontin_2013U TECHNOLOGY CAN IMPROVE THINGS LIKE CROP YIELDS OR SYSTEMS FOR STORING AND TRANSPORTING FOOD
JasonPontin_2013U BUT THERE WILL BE FAMINES SO LONG AS THERE ARE BAD GOVERNMENTS
JasonPontin_2013U FINALLY BIG PROBLEMS SOMETIMES ELUDE SOLUTION BECAUSE WE DON 'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM PRESIDENT NIXON DECLARED WAR ON CANCER IN ONE
JasonPontin_2013U IT 'S NOT TRUE THAT WE CAN 'T SOLVE BIG PROBLEMS THROUGH TECHNOLOGY WE CAN
JasonPontin_2013U WE MUST BUT THESE FOUR ELEMENTS MUST ALL BE PRESENT POLITICAL LEADERS AND THE PUBLIC MUST CARE TO SOLVE A PROBLEM INSTITUTIONS MUST SUPPORT ITS SOLUTION
JasonPontin_2013U IT MUST REALLY BE A TECHNOLOGICAL PROBLEM AND WE MUST UNDERSTAND IT THE
JasonPontin_2013U APOLLO MISSION WHICH HAS BECOME A KIND OF METAPHOR FOR TECHNOLOGY 'S CAPACITY TO SOLVE BIG PROBLEMS MET THESE CRITERIA BUT IT IS AN IRREPRODUCIBLE MODEL FOR THE FUTURE
JasonPontin_2013U IT IS NOT ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE THERE IS NO GALVANIZING CONTEST LIKE THE COLD WAR NO POLITICIAN LIKE JOHN KENNEDY WHO CAN HEROIZE THE DIFFICULT AND THE DANGEROUS AND NO POPULAR SCIENCE FICTIONAL MYTHOLOGY SUCH AS EXPLORING THE SOLAR SYSTEM
JasonPontin_2013U MOST OF ALL GOING TO THE MOON TURNED OUT TO BE EASY
JasonPontin_2013U IT WAS JUST THREE DAYS AWAY AND ARGUABLY IT WASN 'T EVEN SOLVING MUCH OF A PROBLEM
