CKWilliams_2001@12.32:17.20 I THOUGHT I WOULD READ POEMS I HAVE THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT OF YOUTH AND AGE
CKWilliams_2001@18.71:28.82 SORT OF ASTONISHED TO FIND OUT HOW MANY I HAVE ACTUALLY THE FIRST ONE IS DEDICATED TO SPENCER AND HIS GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS SHOCKED BY HIS WORK
CKWilliams_2001@29.53:30.67 MY POEM IS CALLED
CKWilliams_2001@32.74:35.76 MY GRANDMOTHER IS WASHING MY MOUTH OUT WITH SOAP
CKWilliams_2001@36.85:43.20 HALF A LONG CENTURY GONE AND STILL SHE COMES AT ME WITH THAT THICK CRUEL YELLOW BAR
CKWilliams_2001@44.24:54.31 ALL BECAUSE OF A WORD I SAID NOT EVEN SAID REALLY ONLY REPEATED BUT OPEN SHE SAYS OPEN UP HER HAND CLAWING AT MY HEAD
CKWilliams_2001@55.83:65.03 I KNOW NOW HER LIFE WAS HARD SHE LOST THREE CHILDREN AS BABIES THEN HER HUSBAND DIED TOO LEAVING YOUNG SONS AND NO MONEY
CKWilliams_2001@65.56:76.12 SHE'D STAND ME IN THE SINK TO PEE BECAUSE THERE WAS NEVER ROOM IN THE TOILET BUT OH HER SOAP MIGHT ITS BITTER BURNING HAVE BEEN WHAT MADE ME A POET
CKWilliams_2001@77.12:86.14 THE STREET SHE LIVED ON WAS UNPAVED HER FLAT TWO CRAMPED ROOMS AND A FETID KITCHEN WHERE SHE STALKED AND CAUGHT ME
CKWilliams_2001@87.31:92.04 I ADMIT THAT AFTER SHE DID IT I NEVER REALLY LOVED HER AGAIN
CKWilliams_2001@92.65:95.45 SHE LIVED TO A HUNDRED EVEN THEN
CKWilliams_2001@96.18:103.46 ALL ALONG IT WAS THE SADNESS THE SQUALOR BUT I NEVER UNTIL NOW LOVED HER AGAIN
CKWilliams_2001@106.14:110.37 WHEN THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN A MAGAZINE I GOT AN IRATE LETTER FROM MY
CKWilliams_2001@113.38:115.54 YOU HAVE MALIGNED A GREAT WOMAN
CKWilliams_2001@117.01:118.93 IT TOOK SOME
CKWilliams_2001@127.62:128.82 IN THOSE DAYS
CKWilliams_2001@129.59:134.24 THOSE DAYS WHICH EXIST FOR ME ONLY AS THE MOST ELUSIVE MEMORY NOW
CKWilliams_2001@134.69:145.25 WHEN OFTEN THE FIRST SOUND YOU'D HEAR IN THE MORNING WOULD BE A STORM OF BIRDSONG THEN THE SOFT CLOP OF THE HOOVES OF THE HORSE HAULING A MILK WAGON DOWN YOUR BLOCK
CKWilliams_2001@145.63:154.23 AND THE LAST SOUND AT NIGHT AS LIKELY AS NOT WOULD BE YOUR FATHER PULLING UP IN HIS CAR HAVING WORKED LATE AGAIN ALWAYS LATE
CKWilliams_2001@154.59:163.77 AND GOING HEAVILY DOWN TO THE CELLAR TO THE FURNACE TO SHAKE OUT THE ASHES AND DAMP THE DRAFT BEFORE HE CAME UPSTAIRS TO FALL INTO BED
CKWilliams_2001@165.02:177.42 THOSE LONG AGO DAYS WOMEN MY MOTHER MY FRIENDS MOTHERS OUR NEIGHBORS ALL THE WOMEN I KNEW WORE OFTEN MUCH OF THE DAY WHAT WERE CALLED HOUSEDRESSES CHEAP
CKWilliams_2001@177.84:189.65 PRINTED PULPY SEEMINGLY PURPOSEFULLY SHAPELESS LIGHT COTTON SHIFTS THAT YOU WORE OVER YOUR NIGHTGOWN AND WHEN YOU HAD TO GO LOOK FOR A CHILD HANG WASH ON THE LINE
CKWilliams_2001@189.82:200.33 OR RUN DOWN TO THE GROCERY STORE ON THE CORNER UNDER A COAT THE TWISTED HEM OF THE NIGHTGOWN ALWAYS LANK AND YELLOWED DANGLING BENEATH
CKWilliams_2001@201.63:212.40 MORE THAN THE CURLERS SOME OF THE WOMEN SEEMED CONSTANTLY TO HAVE IN THEIR HAIR IN PREPARATION FOR SOME GREAT EVENT A BALL ONE WOULD THINK THAT NEVER CAME TO PASS
CKWilliams_2001@212.93:223.59 MORE THAN THE WAY MOST WOMEN 'S FACES NOT ONLY WERE NEVER MADE UP DURING THE DAY BUT SEEMED SCRAPED BLEACHED AND WITH THEIR PLUCKED EYEBROWS SCARILY MASKLIKE
CKWilliams_2001@224.45:237.11 MORE THAN ALL THAT IT WAS THOSE DRESSES THAT MADE WOMEN SO UNKNOWABLE AND FORBIDDING ADEPTS OF ENIGMAS TO WHICH MEN COULD HAVE NO ACCESS AND BOYS NO CONCEPTION
CKWilliams_2001@238.49:247.26 ONLY LATER WOULD I SEE THE DRESSES ALSO AS A PROCLAMATION THAT IN YOUR DIM KITCHEN YOUR LAUNDRY
CKWilliams_2001@247.49:260.23 YOUR BLEAK CONCRETE YARD WHAT YOU REVEALED OF YOURSELF WAS A FABULATION YOUR REAL SENSUAL NATURE VEILED IN THOSE SEXLESS VESTMENTS WAS UTTERLY YOUR DOMINION
CKWilliams_2001@261.66:270.85 IN THOSE DAYS ONE HID MUCH ELSE AS WELL GROWN MEN DIDN'T EMBRACE ONE ANOTHER UNLESS SOMEONE HAD DIED AND NOT ALWAYS THEN
CKWilliams_2001@271.17:279.34 YOU SHOOK HANDS OR AT A BALL GAME THUMPED YOUR FRIEND 'S BACK AND EXCHANGED BLOWS MEANT TO BE CODES FOR AFFECTION
CKWilliams_2001@280.31:289.17 OF CHILDHOOD YOU'D NEVER AGAIN KNOW THE SHOCK OF YOUR FATHER 'S WHISKERS ON YOUR CHEEK NOT UNTIL MORES AT LAST HAD EVOLVED
CKWilliams_2001@289.43:297.70 AND YOU COULD HUG ANOTHER MAN THEN HOLD ON FOR A MOMENT THEN EVEN KISS YOUR FATHERS BRISTLES WHITE AND STIFF NOW
CKWilliams_2001@298.82:305.29 WHAT RELEASE FINALLY THE EMBRACE THOUGH WE WERE WARY IT SEEMED SO AUDACIOUS
CKWilliams_2001@305.52:316.60 HOW MUCH UNSPOKEN JOY THERE WAS IN THAT AFFIRMATION OF EQUALITY AND COMMUNION NO MATTER HOW MUCH MISUNDERSTANDING AND PAIN HAD PASSED BETWEEN YOU
CKWilliams_2001@318.67:331.20 WE KNEW SO LITTLE IN THOSE DAYS AS LITTLE AS NOW I SUPPOSE ABOUT HEALING THOSE HURTS EVEN THE WOMEN IN THEIR BEST DRESSES WITH BEADS AND SEQUINS SEWN ON THE BODICES
CKWilliams_2001@331.59:340.84 EVEN IN LIPSTICK AND MASCARA THEIR HAIR AFLOW COULD ONLY STAND WRINGING THEIR HANDS BEGGING FOR PEACE WHILE FATHER AND SON
CKWilliams_2001@341.18:349.26 LIKE THUGS LIKE THIEVES LIKE ROMANS SIMMERED AND HISSED AND HATED INFLICTING SORROWS THAT ENDURED
CKWilliams_2001@349.60:357.77 THE WORST ANYWAY THROUGH THE KISS AND EMBRACE BLEEDING FROM BROTHER TO BROTHER INTO THE GENERATIONS
CKWilliams_2001@358.98:365.18 IN THOSE DAYS THERE WAS STILL COUNTRYSIDE CLOSE TO THE CITY FARMS CORNFIELDS COWS
CKWilliams_2001@365.58:376.97 EVEN NOT FAR FROM OUR BUILDING WITH ITS BLURRED BRICK AND LONG SHADOWY HALLWAY YOU COULD FIND TRACTS WITH HILLS AND TREES YOU COULD PRETEND WERE MOUNTAINS AND FORESTS
CKWilliams_2001@377.52:382.46 OR YOU COULD GO OUT BY YOURSELF EVEN TO A HALF BLOCK LONG EMPTY LOT
CKWilliams_2001@382.72:391.68 INTO THE BUSHES LIKE A CREATURE OF LEAVES YOU'D LURK CROUCHED CRAWLING SIMPLIFIED SAVAGE ALONE
CKWilliams_2001@392.74:395.42 ALREADY THERE WAS WANTING TO BE SIMPLER
