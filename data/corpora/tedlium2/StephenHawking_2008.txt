StephenHawking_2008 THERE IS NOTHING BIGGER OR OLDER THAN THE UNIVERSE
StephenHawking_2008 WHERE DID WE COME FROM
StephenHawking_2008 HOW DID THE UNIVERSE COME INTO BEING
StephenHawking_2008 ARE WE ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE
StephenHawking_2008 IS THERE ALIEN LIFE OUT THERE
StephenHawking_2008 WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF THE HUMAN RACE
StephenHawking_2008 UP UNTIL THE NINETEEN TWENTIES EVERYONE THOUGHT THE UNIVERSE WAS ESSENTIALLY STATIC AND UNCHANGING IN TIME
StephenHawking_2008 THEN IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS EXPANDING
StephenHawking_2008 THIS MEANT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN CLOSER TOGETHER
StephenHawking_2008 IF WE EXTRAPOLATE BACK
StephenHawking_2008 WE FIND WE MUST HAVE ALL BEEN ON TOP OF EACH OTHER ABOUT FIFTEEN BILLION YEARS AGO
StephenHawking_2008 THIS WAS THE BIG BANG THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE
StephenHawking_2008 WAS THERE ANYTHING BEFORE THE BIG BANG
StephenHawking_2008 IF NOT WHAT CREATED THE UNIVERSE
StephenHawking_2008 WHY DID THE UNIVERSE EMERGE FROM THE BIG BANG THE WAY IT DID
StephenHawking_2008 WE USED TO THINK THAT THE THEORY OF THE UNIVERSE COULD BE DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS
StephenHawking_2008 FIRST THERE WERE THE LAWS LIKE MAXWELL 'S EQUATIONS AND GENERAL RELATIVITY THAT DETERMINED THE EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE GIVEN ITS STATE OVER ALL OF SPACE AT ONE TIME
StephenHawking_2008 AND SECOND THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF THE INITIAL STATE OF THE UNIVERSE
StephenHawking_2008 WE HAVE MADE GOOD PROGRESS ON THE FIRST PART AND NOW HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAWS OF EVOLUTION IN ALL BUT THE MOST EXTREME CONDITIONS
StephenHawking_2008 BUT UNTIL RECENTLY WE HAVE HAD LITTLE IDEA ABOUT THE INITIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE UNIVERSE
StephenHawking_2008 HOWEVER THIS DIVISION INTO LAWS OF EVOLUTION AND INITIAL CONDITIONS
StephenHawking_2008 UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONS GENERAL RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM THEORY ALLOW TIME TO BEHAVE LIKE ANOTHER DIMENSION OF SPACE
StephenHawking_2008 THE UNIVERSE CAN SPONTANEOUSLY CREATE ITSELF OUT OF NOTHING
StephenHawking_2008 CREATED IN DIFFERENT STATES
StephenHawking_2008 THESE PREDICTIONS ARE
StephenHawking_2008 AGREEMENT WITH OBSERVATIONS BY THE WMAP SATELLITE OF THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND WHICH IS AN IMPRINT OF THE VERY EARLY UNIVERSE
StephenHawking_2008 WE THINK WE HAVE SOLVED THE MYSTERY OF CREATION
StephenHawking_2008 MAYBE WE SHOULD PATENT THE UNIVERSE AND CHARGE EVERYONE ROYALTIES FOR THEIR EXISTENCE
StephenHawking_2008 I NOW TURN TO THE SECOND BIG QUESTION ARE WE ALONE OR IS THERE OTHER LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE
StephenHawking_2008 WE BELIEVE THAT LIFE AROSE SPONTANEOUSLY ON THE EARTH SO IT MUST BE POSSIBLE FOR LIFE TO APPEAR ON OTHER SUITABLE PLANETS OF WHICH THERE SEEM TO BE A LARGE NUMBER IN THE GALAXY
StephenHawking_2008 BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW LIFE FIRST APPEARED
StephenHawking_2008 WE HAVE TWO PIECES OF OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE ON THE PROBABILITY OF LIFE APPEARING
StephenHawking_2008 THE FIRST IS THAT WE HAVE FOSSILS OF ALGAE FROM THREE POINT FIVE BILLION YEARS AGO
StephenHawking_2008 THE EARTH WAS FORMED FOUR POINT SIX BILLION YEARS AGO AND WAS PROBABLY TOO HOT FOR ABOUT THE FIRST HALF BILLION YEARS
StephenHawking_2008 SO LIFE APPEARED ON EARTH WITHIN HALF A BILLION YEARS OF IT BEING POSSIBLE WHICH IS SHORT COMPARED TO THE TEN BILLION YEAR LIFETIME OF A PLANET OF EARTH TYPE
StephenHawking_2008 THIS SUGGESTS THAT A PROBABILITY OF LIFE APPEARING
StephenHawking_2008 IF IT WAS VERY LOW ONE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IT TO TAKE MOST OF THE TEN BILLION YEARS AVAILABLE
StephenHawking_2008 ON THE OTHER HAND WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE
StephenHawking_2008 BEEN VISITED BY ALIENS
StephenHawking_2008 I AM DISCOUNTING THE REPORTS OF
StephenHawking_2008 WHY WOULD THEY APPEAR ONLY TO CRANKS AND WEIRDOS
StephenHawking_2008 THERE IS A GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY TO SUPPRESS THE REPORTS AND KEEP FOR ITSELF THE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE THE ALIENS BRING IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A SINGULARLY INEFFECTIVE POLICY SO FAR
StephenHawking_2008 THIS PROBABLY INDICATES THAT THERE ARE NO ALIEN CIVILIZATIONS AT OUR STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT WITHIN A RADIUS OF A FEW HUNDRED LIGHT YEARS
StephenHawking_2008 THIS BRINGS ME TO THE LAST OF THE BIG QUESTIONS THE FUTURE OF THE HUMAN RACE
StephenHawking_2008 IF WE ARE THE ONLY INTELLIGENT BEINGS IN THE GALAXY WE SHOULD MAKE SURE WE SURVIVE AND CONTINUE
StephenHawking_2008 BUT WE ARE ENTERING AN INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS PERIOD OF OUR HISTORY
StephenHawking_2008 OUR POPULATION AND OUR USE OF THE FINITE RESOURCES OF PLANET EARTH ARE GROWING EXPONENTIALLY ALONG WITH OUR TECHNICAL ABILITY TO CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR GOOD OR ILL
StephenHawking_2008 OUR GENETIC CODE STILL CARRIES THE SELFISH AND AGGRESSIVE INSTINCTS THAT WERE OF SURVIVAL ADVANTAGE IN
StephenHawking_2008 IT WILL BE DIFFICULT ENOUGH TO AVOID DISASTER IN THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS LET ALONE THE NEXT THOUSAND OR
StephenHawking_2008 OUR ONLY CHANCE OF LONG TERM SURVIVAL IS NOT TO REMAIN LURKING ON PLANET EARTH BUT TO SPREAD OUT INTO SPACE
StephenHawking_2008 THE ANSWERS TO THESE BIG QUESTIONS SHOW THAT WE HAVE MADE REMARKABLE PROGRESS IN THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS
StephenHawking_2008 BUT IF WE WANT TO CONTINUE BEYOND THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS OUR FUTURE IS IN SPACE
StephenHawking_2008 THAT IS WHY I AM IN FAVOR OF MANNED OR SHOULD I SAY PERSONED SPACE FLIGHT
StephenHawking_2008 BEEN VERY LUCKY THAT MY DISABILITY HAS NOT BEEN A SERIOUS HANDICAP
StephenHawking_2008 INDEED IT HAS PROBABLY GIVEN ME MORE TIME THAN MOST PEOPLE TO PURSUE THE QUEST FOR KNOWLEDGE
StephenHawking_2008 THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS A COMPLETE THEORY OF THE UNIVERSE AND WE ARE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS
StephenHawking_2008 PROFESSOR IF YOU HAD TO GUESS EITHER WAY DO YOU NOW BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT
StephenHawking_2008 IN THE MILKY WAY AS A CIVILIZATION OF OUR LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE
StephenHawking_2008 THIS ANSWER TOOK SEVEN MINUTES
StephenHawking_2008 AND REALLY GAVE ME AN INSIGHT INTO THE INCREDIBLE
StephenHawking_2008 THINK IT QUITE LIKELY THAT WE ARE THE ONLY CIVILIZATION WITHIN SEVERAL HUNDRED LIGHT YEARS
StephenHawking_2008 OTHERWISE WE WOULD HAVE HEARD RADIO WAVES
