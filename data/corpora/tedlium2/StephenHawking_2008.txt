StephenHawking_2008@14.31:18.02 THERE IS NOTHING BIGGER OR OLDER THAN THE UNIVERSE
StephenHawking_2008@27.48:29.11 WHERE DID WE COME FROM
StephenHawking_2008@30.23:32.60 HOW DID THE UNIVERSE COME INTO BEING
StephenHawking_2008@34.38:36.22 ARE WE ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE
StephenHawking_2008@37.42:39.54 IS THERE ALIEN LIFE OUT THERE
StephenHawking_2008@40.52:43.05 WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF THE HUMAN RACE
StephenHawking_2008@43.87:51.40 UP UNTIL THE NINETEEN TWENTIES EVERYONE THOUGHT THE UNIVERSE WAS ESSENTIALLY STATIC AND UNCHANGING IN TIME
StephenHawking_2008@52.56:55.96 THEN IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS EXPANDING
StephenHawking_2008@61.92:64.54 THIS MEANT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN CLOSER TOGETHER
StephenHawking_2008@66.67:68.10 IF WE EXTRAPOLATE BACK
StephenHawking_2008@68.79:74.96 WE FIND WE MUST HAVE ALL BEEN ON TOP OF EACH OTHER ABOUT FIFTEEN BILLION YEARS AGO
StephenHawking_2008@76.15:79.77 THIS WAS THE BIG BANG THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE
StephenHawking_2008@81.15:83.77 WAS THERE ANYTHING BEFORE THE BIG BANG
StephenHawking_2008@84.86:87.72 IF NOT WHAT CREATED THE UNIVERSE
StephenHawking_2008@88.73:93.11 WHY DID THE UNIVERSE EMERGE FROM THE BIG BANG THE WAY IT DID
StephenHawking_2008@94.61:99.84 WE USED TO THINK THAT THE THEORY OF THE UNIVERSE COULD BE DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS
StephenHawking_2008@101.04:111.91 FIRST THERE WERE THE LAWS LIKE MAXWELL 'S EQUATIONS AND GENERAL RELATIVITY THAT DETERMINED THE EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE GIVEN ITS STATE OVER ALL OF SPACE AT ONE TIME
StephenHawking_2008@113.74:118.50 AND SECOND THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF THE INITIAL STATE OF THE UNIVERSE
StephenHawking_2008@120.15:129.09 WE HAVE MADE GOOD PROGRESS ON THE FIRST PART AND NOW HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAWS OF EVOLUTION IN ALL BUT THE MOST EXTREME CONDITIONS
StephenHawking_2008@129.33:135.61 BUT UNTIL RECENTLY WE HAVE HAD LITTLE IDEA ABOUT THE INITIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE UNIVERSE
StephenHawking_2008@136.82:141.66 HOWEVER THIS DIVISION INTO LAWS OF EVOLUTION AND INITIAL CONDITIONS
StephenHawking_2008@147.18:155.39 UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONS GENERAL RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM THEORY ALLOW TIME TO BEHAVE LIKE ANOTHER DIMENSION OF SPACE
StephenHawking_2008@171.80:175.76 THE UNIVERSE CAN SPONTANEOUSLY CREATE ITSELF OUT OF NOTHING
StephenHawking_2008@184.01:185.77 CREATED IN DIFFERENT STATES
StephenHawking_2008@186.88:187.85 THESE PREDICTIONS ARE
StephenHawking_2008@188.81:198.40 AGREEMENT WITH OBSERVATIONS BY THE WMAP SATELLITE OF THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND WHICH IS AN IMPRINT OF THE VERY EARLY UNIVERSE
StephenHawking_2008@200.32:203.48 WE THINK WE HAVE SOLVED THE MYSTERY OF CREATION
StephenHawking_2008@204.73:210.42 MAYBE WE SHOULD PATENT THE UNIVERSE AND CHARGE EVERYONE ROYALTIES FOR THEIR EXISTENCE
StephenHawking_2008@213.73:220.52 I NOW TURN TO THE SECOND BIG QUESTION ARE WE ALONE OR IS THERE OTHER LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE
StephenHawking_2008@224.38:236.55 WE BELIEVE THAT LIFE AROSE SPONTANEOUSLY ON THE EARTH SO IT MUST BE POSSIBLE FOR LIFE TO APPEAR ON OTHER SUITABLE PLANETS OF WHICH THERE SEEM TO BE A LARGE NUMBER IN THE GALAXY
StephenHawking_2008@239.15:241.96 BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW LIFE FIRST APPEARED
StephenHawking_2008@244.52:250.31 WE HAVE TWO PIECES OF OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE ON THE PROBABILITY OF LIFE APPEARING
StephenHawking_2008@252.29:258.41 THE FIRST IS THAT WE HAVE FOSSILS OF ALGAE FROM THREE POINT FIVE BILLION YEARS AGO
StephenHawking_2008@259.54:268.03 THE EARTH WAS FORMED FOUR POINT SIX BILLION YEARS AGO AND WAS PROBABLY TOO HOT FOR ABOUT THE FIRST HALF BILLION YEARS
StephenHawking_2008@273.83:284.45 SO LIFE APPEARED ON EARTH WITHIN HALF A BILLION YEARS OF IT BEING POSSIBLE WHICH IS SHORT COMPARED TO THE TEN BILLION YEAR LIFETIME OF A PLANET OF EARTH TYPE
StephenHawking_2008@285.84:289.24 THIS SUGGESTS THAT A PROBABILITY OF LIFE APPEARING
StephenHawking_2008@291.64:298.27 IF IT WAS VERY LOW ONE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IT TO TAKE MOST OF THE TEN BILLION YEARS AVAILABLE
StephenHawking_2008@299.35:302.18 ON THE OTHER HAND WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE
StephenHawking_2008@302.29:304.07 BEEN VISITED BY ALIENS
StephenHawking_2008@305.07:306.75 I AM DISCOUNTING THE REPORTS OF
StephenHawking_2008@309.07:312.20 WHY WOULD THEY APPEAR ONLY TO CRANKS AND WEIRDOS
StephenHawking_2008@315.21:327.85 THERE IS A GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY TO SUPPRESS THE REPORTS AND KEEP FOR ITSELF THE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE THE ALIENS BRING IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A SINGULARLY INEFFECTIVE POLICY SO FAR
StephenHawking_2008@342.59:352.35 THIS PROBABLY INDICATES THAT THERE ARE NO ALIEN CIVILIZATIONS AT OUR STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT WITHIN A RADIUS OF A FEW HUNDRED LIGHT YEARS
StephenHawking_2008@362.60:368.00 THIS BRINGS ME TO THE LAST OF THE BIG QUESTIONS THE FUTURE OF THE HUMAN RACE
StephenHawking_2008@369.02:375.94 IF WE ARE THE ONLY INTELLIGENT BEINGS IN THE GALAXY WE SHOULD MAKE SURE WE SURVIVE AND CONTINUE
StephenHawking_2008@379.23:383.64 BUT WE ARE ENTERING AN INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS PERIOD OF OUR HISTORY
StephenHawking_2008@388.41:399.95 OUR POPULATION AND OUR USE OF THE FINITE RESOURCES OF PLANET EARTH ARE GROWING EXPONENTIALLY ALONG WITH OUR TECHNICAL ABILITY TO CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR GOOD OR ILL
StephenHawking_2008@405.27:412.20 OUR GENETIC CODE STILL CARRIES THE SELFISH AND AGGRESSIVE INSTINCTS THAT WERE OF SURVIVAL ADVANTAGE IN
StephenHawking_2008@417.25:424.30 IT WILL BE DIFFICULT ENOUGH TO AVOID DISASTER IN THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS LET ALONE THE NEXT THOUSAND OR
StephenHawking_2008@428.88:437.49 OUR ONLY CHANCE OF LONG TERM SURVIVAL IS NOT TO REMAIN LURKING ON PLANET EARTH BUT TO SPREAD OUT INTO SPACE
StephenHawking_2008@440.42:447.55 THE ANSWERS TO THESE BIG QUESTIONS SHOW THAT WE HAVE MADE REMARKABLE PROGRESS IN THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS
StephenHawking_2008@448.67:454.80 BUT IF WE WANT TO CONTINUE BEYOND THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS OUR FUTURE IS IN SPACE
StephenHawking_2008@456.96:462.70 THAT IS WHY I AM IN FAVOR OF MANNED OR SHOULD I SAY PERSONED SPACE FLIGHT
StephenHawking_2008@476.24:481.33 BEEN VERY LUCKY THAT MY DISABILITY HAS NOT BEEN A SERIOUS HANDICAP
StephenHawking_2008@482.07:488.69 INDEED IT HAS PROBABLY GIVEN ME MORE TIME THAN MOST PEOPLE TO PURSUE THE QUEST FOR KNOWLEDGE
StephenHawking_2008@492.53:498.47 THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS A COMPLETE THEORY OF THE UNIVERSE AND WE ARE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS
StephenHawking_2008@507.03:513.70 PROFESSOR IF YOU HAD TO GUESS EITHER WAY DO YOU NOW BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT
StephenHawking_2008@515.82:520.97 IN THE MILKY WAY AS A CIVILIZATION OF OUR LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE
StephenHawking_2008@537.49:541.26 THIS ANSWER TOOK SEVEN MINUTES
StephenHawking_2008@541.79:544.83 AND REALLY GAVE ME AN INSIGHT INTO THE INCREDIBLE
StephenHawking_2008@559.11:565.71 THINK IT QUITE LIKELY THAT WE ARE THE ONLY CIVILIZATION WITHIN SEVERAL HUNDRED LIGHT YEARS
StephenHawking_2008@567.09:570.23 OTHERWISE WE WOULD HAVE HEARD RADIO WAVES
