EdUlbrich_2009@15.78:24.75 I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING A TEAM OF ARTISTS AND TECHNOLOGISTS AND FILMMAKERS THAT WORKED TOGETHER ON A REMARKABLE FILM PROJECT FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS
EdUlbrich_2009@26.07:37.03 AND ALONG THE WAY THEY CREATED A BREAKTHROUGH IN COMPUTER VISUALIZATION SO I WANT TO SHOW YOU A CLIP OF THE FILM NOW HOPEFULLY IT WON 'T STUTTER AND IF WE DID OUR JOBS WELL YOU WON 'T KNOW THAT WE WERE EVEN INVOLVED
EdUlbrich_2009@40.06:40.29 MORE
EdUlbrich_2009@42.04:42.91 IF I TOLD
EdUlbrich_2009@60.20:60.78 NEED TO BE
EdUlbrich_2009@84.56:85.24 YOU
EdUlbrich_2009@90.08:90.50 ALONG WITH
EdUlbrich_2009@93.42:95.39 I FELT PRETTY GOOD
EdUlbrich_2009@98.17:107.64 THAT WAS A CLIP FROM THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON MANY OF YOU MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN IT OR YOU'VE HEARD OF THE STORY BUT WHAT YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IS THAT FOR NEARLY THE FIRST HOUR OF THE FILM
EdUlbrich_2009@107.93:113.73 THE MAIN CHARACTER BENJAMIN BUTTON WHO 'S PLAYED BY BRAD PITT IS COMPLETELY COMPUTER GENERATED FROM THE NECK UP
EdUlbrich_2009@114.43:122.29 NOW THERE'S NO USE OF PROSTHETIC MAKEUP OR PHOTOGRAPHY OF BRAD SUPERIMPOSED OVER ANOTHER ACTOR 'S BODY WE'VE CREATED A COMPLETELY DIGITAL HUMAN HEAD
EdUlbrich_2009@122.69:129.91 SO I'D LIKE TO START WITH A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY ON THE PROJECT THIS IS BASED ON AN F SCOTT FITZGERALD SHORT STORY IT'S ABOUT A MAN WHO 'S BORN OLD AND LIVES HIS LIFE
EdUlbrich_2009@130.35:144.54 IN REVERSE NOW THIS MOVIE HAS FLOATED AROUND HOLLYWOOD FOR WELL OVER HALF A CENTURY AND WE FIRST GOT INVOLVED WITH THE PROJECT IN THE EARLY NINETIES WITH RON HOWARD AS THE DIRECTOR WE TOOK A LOT OF MEETINGS AND WE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED IT BUT AT THE TIME WE HAD TO THROW IN THE TOWEL
EdUlbrich_2009@145.01:157.01 IT WAS DEEMED IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS BEYOND THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE DAY TO DEPICT A MAN AGING BACKWARDS THE HUMAN FORM IN PARTICULAR THE HUMAN HEAD HAS BEEN CONSIDERED THE HOLY GRAIL OF OUR INDUSTRY
EdUlbrich_2009@158.01:164.68 THE PROJECT CAME BACK TO US ABOUT A DECADE LATER AND THIS TIME WITH A DIRECTOR NAMED DAVID FINCHER NOW FINCHER IS AN INTERESTING GUY
EdUlbrich_2009@166.10:177.02 DAVID IS FEARLESS OF TECHNOLOGY AND HE IS ABSOLUTELY TENACIOUS AND DAVID WON 'T TAKE NO AND DAVID BELIEVED LIKE WE DO IN THE VISUAL EFFECTS INDUSTRY THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE
EdUlbrich_2009@185.43:194.67 AND HE THREW A CHALLENGE AT US HE WANTED THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THE FILM TO BE PLAYED FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE BY ONE ACTOR IT HAPPENED TO BE THIS GUY
EdUlbrich_2009@195.13:202.24 WE WENT THROUGH A PROCESS OF ELIMINATION AND A PROCESS OF DISCOVERY WITH DAVID AND WE RULED OUT OF COURSE SWAPPING ACTORS THAT WAS ONE IDEA THAT WE WOULD HAVE
EdUlbrich_2009@222.85:229.85 SO WE DECIDED TO CAST A SERIES OF LITTLE PEOPLE THAT WOULD PLAY THE DIFFERENT BODIES OF BENJAMIN AT THE DIFFERENT INCREMENTS OF HIS LIFE
EdUlbrich_2009@230.15:238.36 AND THAT WE WOULD IN FACT CREATE A COMPUTER GENERATED VERSION OF BRAD 'S HEAD AGED TO APPEAR AS BENJAMIN AND ATTACH THAT TO THE BODY OF THE REAL ACTOR
EdUlbrich_2009@238.79:246.75 SOUNDED GREAT OF COURSE THIS WAS THE HOLY GRAIL OF OUR INDUSTRY AND THE FACT THAT THIS GUY IS A GLOBAL ICON DIDN'T HELP
EdUlbrich_2009@247.24:254.52 EITHER BECAUSE I'M SURE IF ANY OF YOU EVER STAND IN LINE AT THE GROCERY STORE YOU KNOW WE SEE HIS FACE CONSTANTLY SO THERE REALLY WAS NO TOLERABLE MARGIN OF ERROR
EdUlbrich_2009@284.61:298.48 BUT WE USED LOTS OF CHEATS AND SHORTCUTS WE BASICALLY PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER TO GET THROUGH THE MEETING I'LL ROLL THAT FOR YOU NOW THIS WAS THE FIRST TEST FOR BENJAMIN BUTTON AND IN HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT'S A COMPUTER GENERATED HEAD IT'S PRETTY GOOD ATTACHED TO THE BODY OF AN ACTOR
EdUlbrich_2009@299.13:307.52 AND IT WORKED AND IT GAVE THE STUDIO GREAT RELIEF AFTER MANY YEARS OF STARTS AND STOPS ON THIS PROJECT AND MAKING THAT TOUGH DECISION
EdUlbrich_2009@307.97:316.73 THEY FINALLY DECIDED TO GREENLIGHT THE MOVIE AND I CAN REMEMBER ACTUALLY WHEN I GOT THE PHONE CALL TO CONGRATULATE US TO SAY THE MOVIE WAS A GO I ACTUALLY THREW UP
EdUlbrich_2009@319.77:328.45 THIS IS SOME TOUGH STUFF SO WE STARTED TO HAVE EARLY TEAM MEETINGS AND WE GOT EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND IT WAS REALLY MORE LIKE THERAPY IN THE BEGINNING
EdUlbrich_2009@338.57:346.11 WE REALLY FELT LIKE WE WERE IN A KIND OF A TWELVE STEP PROGRAM AND OF COURSE THE FIRST STEP IS ADMIT YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM
EdUlbrich_2009@348.29:361.42 SO WE HAD A BIG PROBLEM WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW WE WERE GOING TO DO THIS BUT WE DID KNOW ONE THING BEING FROM THE VISUAL EFFECTS INDUSTRY WE WITH DAVID BELIEVED THAT WE NOW HAD ENOUGH TIME ENOUGH RESOURCES AND GOD WE HOPED WE HAD ENOUGH MONEY
EdUlbrich_2009@375.49:384.09 WE NEEDED TO MAKE BRAD LOOK A LOT OLDER WE NEEDED TO AGE HIM FORTY FIVE YEARS OR SO AND WE ALSO NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD TAKE BRAD 'S
EdUlbrich_2009@394.86:401.93 A CHARACTER THAT COULD HOLD UP UNDER REALLY ALL CONDITIONS HE NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO WALK IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AT NIGHTTIME UNDER CANDLELIGHT
EdUlbrich_2009@410.16:418.43 NOT ALL AT THE SAME TIME BUT HE HAD TO YOU KNOW DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND THE WORK HAD TO HOLD UP FOR ALMOST THE FIRST HOUR OF THE MOVIE WE DID ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE SHOTS
EdUlbrich_2009@418.71:425.37 SO WE NEEDED A SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALLOW BENJAMIN TO DO EVERYTHING A HUMAN BEING CAN DO
EdUlbrich_2009@425.64:437.08 AND WE REALIZED THAT THERE WAS A GIANT CHASM BETWEEN THE STATE OF THE ART OF TECHNOLOGY IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR AND WHERE WE NEEDED IT TO BE SO WE FOCUSED ON MOTION CAPTURE I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN MOTION CAPTURE
EdUlbrich_2009@446.54:460.73 AND INSTEAD OF USING CAMERAS THERE'S INFRARED SENSORS AROUND A VOLUME AND THOSE INFRARED SENSORS TRACK THE THREE DIMENSIONAL POSITION OF THOSE MARKERS IN REAL TIME AND THEN ANIMATORS CAN TAKE THE DATA OF THE MOTION OF THOSE MARKERS AND APPLY THEM TO A COMPUTER GENERATED CHARACTER YOU CAN SEE THE
EdUlbrich_2009@475.17:485.31 A PRETTY CRAPPY PERFORMANCE THAT'S NOT TERRIBLY COMPELLING AND WHAT WE REALIZED WAS THAT WHAT WE NEEDED WAS THE INFORMATION THAT WAS GOING ON BETWEEN THE MARKERS WE
EdUlbrich_2009@496.54:507.64 THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE DAY THE STATUS QUO THE STATE OF THE ART SO WE ABORTED USING MOTION CAPTURE AND WE WERE NOW WELL OUT OF OUR COMFORT ZONE AND IN UNCHARTED TERRITORY SO
EdUlbrich_2009@508.52:516.57 WE WERE LEFT WITH THIS IDEA THAT WE ENDED UP CALLING TECHNOLOGY STEW WE STARTED TO LOOK OUT IN OTHER FIELDS AND THE IDEA WAS THAT WE WERE GOING TO FIND
EdUlbrich_2009@516.92:528.33 NUGGETS OR GEMS OF TECHNOLOGY THAT COME FROM OTHER INDUSTRIES LIKE MEDICAL IMAGING THE VIDEO GAME SPACE AND RE APPROPRIATE THEM AND WE HAD TO CREATE KIND OF A SAUCE AND THE SAUCE WAS
EdUlbrich_2009@529.13:542.09 CODE IN SOFTWARE THAT WE'D WRITTEN TO ALLOW THESE DISPARATE PIECES OF TECHNOLOGY TO COME TOGETHER AND WORK AS ONE INITIALLY WE CAME ACROSS SOME REMARKABLE RESEARCH DONE BY A GENTLEMAN NAMED DOCTOR PAUL EKMAN IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES HE BELIEVED
EdUlbrich_2009@543.10:550.81 COULD IN FACT CATALOG THE HUMAN FACE AND HE CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA OF FACIAL ACTION CODING SYSTEM HE BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE SEVENTY
EdUlbrich_2009@551.34:563.02 BASIC POSES OR SHAPES OF THE HUMAN FACE AND THAT FROM THOSE BASIC POSES OR SHAPES OF THE FACE THEY CAN BE COMBINED TO CREATE INFINITE POSSIBILITIES OF EVERYTHING THE HUMAN FACE IS CAPABLE OF DOING AND OF COURSE
EdUlbrich_2009@563.88:572.15 THESE TRANSCEND AGE RACE CULTURE GENDER SO THIS BECAME THE FOUNDATION OF OUR RESEARCH AS WE WENT FORWARD AND THEN WE CAME ACROSS SOME REMARKABLE TECHNOLOGY
EdUlbrich_2009@572.58:586.59 CALLED CONTOUR AND HERE YOU CAN SEE A SUBJECT HAVING PHOSPHORUS MAKEUP STIPPLED ON HER FACE AND NOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS REALLY CREATING A SURFACE CAPTURE AS OPPOSED TO A MARKER CAPTURE THE SUBJECT STANDS IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER ARRAY OF CAMERAS AND THOSE CAMERAS CAN
EdUlbrich_2009@587.20:599.12 FRAME BY FRAME RECONSTRUCT GEOMETRY OF EXACTLY WHAT THE SUBJECT 'S DOING AT THE MOMENT SO EFFECTIVELY YOU GET THREE D DATA IN REAL TIME OF THE SUBJECT AND IF YOU LOOK IN A COMPARISON ON THE LEFT
EdUlbrich_2009@599.54:606.11 WE SEE WHAT VOLUMETRIC DATA GIVES US AND ON THE RIGHT YOU SEE WHAT MARKERS GIVE US SO CLEARLY WE WERE IN A SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER PLACE FOR THIS
EdUlbrich_2009@606.53:615.16 THE EARLY DAYS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY AND IT WASN'T REALLY PROVEN YET BUT WE MEASURE COMPLEXITY AND FIDELITY OF DATA IN TERMS OF POLYGONAL COUNT AND SO
EdUlbrich_2009@615.76:622.45 ON THE LEFT WE WERE SEEING ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND POLYGONS WE COULD GO UP INTO THE MILLIONS OF POLYGONS IT SEEMED TO BE INFINITE THIS WAS WHEN WE HAD OUR
EdUlbrich_2009@623.36:632.66 THIS WAS THE BREAKTHROUGH THIS IS WHEN WE'RE LIKE OK WE'RE GOING TO BE OK THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK AND THE A HA WAS WHAT IF WE COULD TAKE BRAD PITT AND WE COULD PUT BRAD
EdUlbrich_2009@633.35:641.18 IN THIS DEVICE AND USE THIS CONTOUR PROCESS AND WE COULD STIPPLE ON THIS PHOSPHORESCENT MAKEUP AND PUT HIM UNDER THE BLACK LIGHTS AND WE COULD IN FACT
EdUlbrich_2009@641.53:651.48 SCAN HIM IN REAL TIME PERFORMING EKMAN 'S FACS POSES RIGHT SO EFFECTIVELY WE ENDED UP WITH A THREE D DATABASE OF EVERYTHING BRAD PITT 'S FACE IS CAPABLE OF DOING
EdUlbrich_2009@653.46:663.27 FROM THERE WE ACTUALLY CARVED UP THOSE FACES INTO SMALLER PIECES AND COMPONENTS OF HIS FACE SO WE ENDED UP WITH LITERALLY THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SHAPES
EdUlbrich_2009@663.54:674.09 A COMPLETE DATABASE OF ALL POSSIBILITIES THAT HIS FACE IS CAPABLE OF DOING NOW THAT'S GREAT EXCEPT WE HAD HIM AT AGE FORTY FOUR WE NEED TO PUT ANOTHER FORTY YEARS ON HIM AT THIS POINT WE BROUGHT IN
EdUlbrich_2009@674.41:687.72 RICK BAKER AND RICK IS ONE OF THE GREAT MAKEUP AND SPECIAL EFFECTS GURUS OF OUR INDUSTRY AND WE ALSO BROUGHT IN A GENTLEMAN NAMED KAZU TSUJI AND KAZU TSUJI IS ONE OF THE GREAT PHOTOREAL SCULPTORS OF OUR TIME AND WE COMMISSIONED THEM TO MAKE A MAQUETTE
EdUlbrich_2009@688.26:695.36 OR A BUST OF BENJAMIN SO IN THE SPIRIT OF THE GREAT UNVEILING I HAD TO DO THIS I HAD TO UNVEIL SOMETHING SO THIS IS
EdUlbrich_2009@698.32:709.02 WE CREATED THREE OF THESE THERE'S BEN EIGHTY THERE'S BEN SEVENTY THERE'S BEN SIXTY AND THIS REALLY BECAME THE TEMPLATE OF MOVING FORWARD NOW THIS WAS MADE FROM A LIFE CAST OF BRAD SO IN FACT
EdUlbrich_2009@721.63:733.02 AND SO NOW WE HAD THREE AGE INCREMENTS OF BENJAMIN IN THE COMPUTER BUT WE NEEDED TO GET A DATABASE OF HIM DOING MORE THAN THAT WE WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS THEN CALLED RETARGETING
EdUlbrich_2009@733.38:742.71 THIS IS BRAD DOING ONE OF THE EKMAN FACS POSES AND HERE 'S THE RESULTING DATA THAT COMES FROM THAT THE MODEL THAT COMES FROM THAT AND RETARGETING IS THE PROCESS OF TRANSPOSING
EdUlbrich_2009@743.10:751.84 THAT DATA ONTO ANOTHER MODEL AND BECAUSE THE LIFE CAST OR THE BUST THE MAQUETTE OF BENJAMIN WAS MADE FROM BRAD WE COULD TRANSPOSE THE DATA
EdUlbrich_2009@753.13:765.03 OF BRAD AT FORTY FOUR ONTO BRAD AT EIGHTY SEVEN SO NOW WE HAD A THREE D DATABASE OF EVERYTHING BRAD PITT 'S FACE CAN DO AT AGE EIGHTY SEVEN IN HIS SEVENTIES AND IN HIS SIXTIES NEXT WE HAD TO GO INTO THE SHOOTING PROCESS SO
EdUlbrich_2009@765.29:773.41 ALL THAT'S GOING ON WE'RE DOWN IN NEW ORLEANS AND LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD AND WE SHOT OUR BODY ACTORS AND WE SHOT THEM WEARING BLUE HOODS SO THIS IS THE GENTLEMAN PLAYING BENJAMIN
EdUlbrich_2009@773.75:782.97 THE BLUE HOODS HELPED US WITH TWO THINGS ONE WE COULD EASILY ERASE THEIR HEADS AND WE ALSO PUT TRACKING MARKERS ON THEIR HEADS SO WE COULD RECREATE THE CAMERA MOTION AND THE LENS OPTICS FROM THE SET
EdUlbrich_2009@783.22:791.27 BUT NOW WE NEEDED TO GET BRAD 'S PERFORMANCE TO DRIVE OUR VIRTUAL BENJAMIN AND SO WE EDITED THE FOOTAGE THAT WAS SHOT ON LOCATION WITH THE REST OF THE CAST AND THE
EdUlbrich_2009@792.56:800.05 BODY ACTORS AND ABOUT SIX MONTHS LATER WE BROUGHT BRAD ONTO A SOUND STAGE IN LOS ANGELES AND HE WATCHED ON THE SCREEN
EdUlbrich_2009@821.94:831.88 FROM THERE WE WENT INTO A PROCESS CALLED IMAGE ANALYSIS AND SO HERE YOU CAN SEE AGAIN THE CHOSEN TAKE AND WE ARE SEEING NOW THAT DATA BEING TRANSPOSED ON TO BEN EIGHTY SEVEN
EdUlbrich_2009@832.23:842.76 AND SO WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS WE USED SOMETHING CALLED IMAGE ANALYSIS WHICH IS TAKING TIMINGS FROM DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF BENJAMIN'S FACE AND SO WE COULD CHOOSE SAY HIS LEFT EYEBROW AND THE SOFTWARE WOULD TELL US THAT WELL
EdUlbrich_2009@843.07:855.96 IN FRAME FOURTEEN THE LEFT EYEBROW BEGINS TO MOVE FROM HERE TO HERE AND IT CONCLUDES MOVING IN FRAME THIRTY TWO AND SO WE COULD CHOOSE NUMBERS OF POSITIONS ON THE FACE TO PULL THAT DATA FROM AND THEN THE SAUCE I TALKED ABOUT WITH OUR TECHNOLOGY STEW THAT SECRET SAUCE
EdUlbrich_2009@856.86:869.73 WAS EFFECTIVELY SOFTWARE THAT ALLOWED US TO MATCH THE PERFORMANCE FOOTAGE OF BRAD IN LIVE ACTION WITH OUR DATABASE OF AGED BENJAMIN THE FACS SHAPES THAT WE HAD ON A FRAME BY FRAME BASIS WE COULD ACTUALLY RECONSTRUCT
EdUlbrich_2009@870.17:879.98 A THREE D HEAD THAT EXACTLY MATCHED THE PERFORMANCE OF BRAD SO THIS WAS HOW THE FINISHED SHOT APPEARED IN THE FILM AND HERE YOU CAN SEE THE BODY ACTOR
EdUlbrich_2009@905.14:911.22 NEXT SECTION HERE I'M GOING TO JUST BLAST THROUGH THIS BECAUSE WE COULD DO A WHOLE TEDTALK ON THE NEXT SEVERAL SLIDES
EdUlbrich_2009@911.92:919.88 TO CREATE A LIGHTING SYSTEM SO REALLY A BIG PART OF OUR PROCESSES WERE CREATING A LIGHTING ENVIRONMENT FOR EVERY SINGLE LOCATION THAT BENJAMIN HAD TO APPEAR SO THAT
EdUlbrich_2009@920.41:927.75 WE COULD PUT BEN 'S HEAD INTO ANY SCENE AND IT WOULD EXACTLY MATCH THE LIGHTING THAT'S ON THE OTHER ACTORS IN THE REAL WORLD WE ALSO HAD TO CREATE AN EYE SYSTEM
EdUlbrich_2009@928.01:935.28 WE FOUND THE OLD ADAGE YOU KNOW THE EYES ARE THE WINDOW TO THE SOUL ABSOLUTELY TRUE SO THE KEY HERE WAS TO KEEP EVERYBODY LOOKING IN BEN 'S EYES
EdUlbrich_2009@935.66:944.76 AND IF YOU COULD FEEL THE WARMTH AND FEEL THE HUMANITY AND FEEL HIS INTENT COMING THROUGH THE EYES THEN WE WOULD SUCCEED SO WE HAD ONE PERSON FOCUSED ON THE EYE SYSTEM FOR ALMOST
EdUlbrich_2009@963.46:970.90 SKIN DISPLACEMENT ANOTHER BIG DEAL THE SKIN HAD TO BE ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE AND HE 'S ALSO IN AN OLD AGE HOME HE 'S IN A NURSING HOME AROUND OTHER OLD PEOPLE SO HE HAD TO LOOK
EdUlbrich_2009@979.56:989.45 SO EFFECTIVELY WE CREATED A DIGITAL PUPPET THAT BRAD PITT COULD OPERATE WITH HIS OWN FACE THERE WERE NO ANIMATORS NECESSARY TO COME IN AND INTERPRET BEHAVIOR
EdUlbrich_2009@990.06:998.69 OR ENHANCE HIS PERFORMANCE THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WE ENCOUNTERED THOUGH THAT WE ENDED UP CALLING THE DIGITAL BOTOX EFFECT SO AS THINGS WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS
EdUlbrich_2009@1015.65:1026.97 HAPPY SMILE OR A FRUSTRATED SMILE SO IT DID TAKE HUMANS TO KIND OF PUSH IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BUT WE ENDED UP CALLING THE ENTIRE PROCESS AND ALL THE TECHNOLOGY EMOTION CAPTURE AS OPPOSED TO JUST MOTION CAPTURE TAKE ANOTHER LOOK
EdUlbrich_2009@1030.26:1031.16 BUT
EdUlbrich_2009@1055.18:1057.36 HOW TO CREATE A DIGITAL HUMAN IN EIGHTEEN MINUTES
EdUlbrich_2009@1068.93:1069.31 REALLY
EdUlbrich_2009@1069.90:1078.28 HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE PEOPLE OVER TWO YEARS AND WE DIDN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT SIXTY HAIRSTYLES AND AN ALL DIGITAL HAIRCUT BUT THAT IS BENJAMIN THANK YOU
