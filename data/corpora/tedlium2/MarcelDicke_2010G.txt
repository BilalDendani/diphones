MarcelDicke_2010G GOING TO SHOW YOU AGAIN SOMETHING ABOUT OUR DIETS
MarcelDicke_2010G AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE AUDIENCE IS AND SO WHO OF YOU EVER ATE INSECTS
MarcelDicke_2010G EIGHTY PERCENT OUT THERE THAT REALLY EATS INSECTS BUT THIS IS QUITE GOOD
MarcelDicke_2010G WHY NOT EAT INSECTS WELL FIRST WHAT ARE INSECTS INSECTS ARE ANIMALS THAT WALK AROUND ON SIX LEGS AND HERE YOU SEE JUST A SELECTION THERE'S SIX MILLION SPECIES OF INSECTS ON THIS PLANET
MarcelDicke_2010G OF ALL ANIMALS ON EARTH OF ALL ANIMAL SPECIES EIGHTY PERCENT WALKS ON SIX LEGS BUT IF WE WOULD COUNT ALL THE INDIVIDUALS AND TAKE AN AVERAGE WEIGHT OF THEM
MarcelDicke_2010G IT WOULD AMOUNT TO SOMETHING LIKE TWO HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND KG FOR EACH OF YOU AND ME ON EARTH THAT MEANS THAT IN TERMS OF
MarcelDicke_2010G THE U S ECONOMY BENEFITED BY FIFTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR IT'S A NUMBER VERY LARGE
MarcelDicke_2010G A CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMY OF THE UNITED STATES FOR FREE AND SO I LOOKED UP WHAT THE ECONOMY WAS PAYING FOR THE WAR IN IRAQ IN THE SAME YEAR
MarcelDicke_2010G EIGHTY BILLION U S DOLLARS WELL WE KNOW THAT THAT WAS NOT A CHEAP WAR SO INSECTS
MarcelDicke_2010G JUST FOR FREE CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMY OF THE UNITED STATES WITH ABOUT THE SAME ORDER OF MAGNITUDE JUST FOR FREE WITHOUT EVERYONE KNOWING
MarcelDicke_2010G AND NOT ONLY IN THE STATES BUT IN ANY COUNTRY IN ANY ECONOMY WHAT DO THEY DO THEY REMOVE DUNG THEY POLLINATE OUR CROPS
MarcelDicke_2010G A THIRD OF ALL THE FRUITS THAT WE EAT ARE ALL A RESULT OF INSECTS TAKING CARE OF THE REPRODUCTION OF PLANTS THEY CONTROL PESTS AND THEY'RE FOOD FOR ANIMALS THEY'RE AT THE START OF FOOD CHAINS
MarcelDicke_2010G OF PEOPLE THAT ARE EATING INSECTS AND HERE YOU SEE ME IN A SMALL PROVINCIAL TOWN IN CHINA LIJIANG ABOUT TWO MILLION INHABITANTS IF YOU GO OUT FOR DINNER
MarcelDicke_2010G LIKE IN A FISH RESTAURANT WHERE YOU CAN SELECT WHICH FISH YOU WANT TO EAT YOU CAN SELECT WHICH INSECTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO
MarcelDicke_2010G THERE'S MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND SPECIES OF INSECTS THAT ARE BEING EATEN ALL AROUND THE GLOBE THAT'S QUITE A BIT MORE THAN JUST A FEW
MarcelDicke_2010G MAMMALS THAT WE'RE EATING LIKE A COW OR A PIG OR A SHEEP MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND SPECIES AN ENORMOUS VARIETY
MarcelDicke_2010G AND NOW YOU MAY THINK OKAY IN THIS PROVINCIAL TOWN IN CHINA THEY'RE DOING THAT BUT NOT US WELL WE'VE SEEN ALREADY THAT QUITE SOME OF YOU ALREADY ATE INSECTS MAYBE OCCASIONALLY
MarcelDicke_2010G SOME FRUITS GET SOME INSECT DAMAGE THOSE ARE THE FRUITS IF THEY'RE TOMATO THAT GO TO THE TOMATO SOUP IF THEY DON'T HAVE ANY DAMAGE THEY GO TO THE GROCERY AND THAT'S YOUR VIEW OF A TOMATO
MarcelDicke_2010G CAN BE ALL KINDS OF THINGS IN THERE NO PROBLEM
MarcelDicke_2010G IN FACT WHY WOULD WE PUT THESE BALLS IN THE SOUP THERE'S MEAT IN THERE ANYWAY
MarcelDicke_2010G IN FACT ALL OUR PROCESSED FOODS CONTAIN MORE PROTEINS THAN WE WOULD BE AWARE OF SO ANYTHING IS A PROTEIN SOURCE ALREADY
MarcelDicke_2010G NOW YOU MAY SAY OKAY SO WE'RE EATING FIVE HUNDRED GRAMS JUST BY ACCIDENT WE'RE EVEN DOING THIS ON PURPOSE IN A LOT OF FOOD ITEMS THAT WE HAVE
MarcelDicke_2010G I HAVE ONLY TWO ITEMS HERE ON THE SLIDE PINK COOKIES OR SURIMI STICKS OR IF YOU LIKE CAMPARI A LOT OF OUR FOOD PRODUCTS THAT ARE OF A RED COLOR
MarcelDicke_2010G DYED WITH A NATURAL DYE THE SURIMI STICKS IS CRAB MEAT OR IS BEING SOLD AS CRAB MEAT IS WHITE FISH THAT'S BEING DYED WITH COCHINEAL COCHINEAL IS A PRODUCT
MarcelDicke_2010G OF AN INSECT THAT LIVES OFF THE CACTI IT'S BEING PRODUCED IN LARGE AMOUNTS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY METRIC TONS PER YEAR IN THE CANARY ISLANDS IN PERU AND IT'S BIG BUSINESS
MarcelDicke_2010G ONE GRAM OF COCHINEAL COSTS ABOUT THIRTY EUROS ONE GRAM OF GOLD IS THIRTY EUROS
MarcelDicke_2010G SO IT'S A VERY PRECIOUS THING THAT WE'RE USING TO DYE OUR FOODS NOW THE SITUATION IN THE WORLD IS GOING TO CHANGE
MarcelDicke_2010G FOR YOU AND ME FOR EVERYONE ON THIS EARTH THE HUMAN POPULATION IS GROWING VERY RAPIDLY AND IS GROWING EXPONENTIALLY
MarcelDicke_2010G IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIGURES UP THERE IT SAYS THAT WE HAVE A THIRD MORE MOUTHS TO FEED BUT WE NEED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION INCREASE OF SEVENTY PERCENT AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THIS WORLD POPULATION IN INCREASING AND IT'S INCREASING
MarcelDicke_2010G NOT ONLY IN NUMBERS BUT WE'RE ALSO GETTING WEALTHIER AND ANYONE THAT GETS WEALTHIER STARTS TO EAT MORE AND ALSO STARTS TO EAT MORE MEAT AND MEAT IN FACT IS SOMETHING
MarcelDicke_2010G COSTS A LOT OF OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION OUR DIET CONSISTS FOR SOME PART OF ANIMAL PROTEINS AND AT THE MOMENT MOST OF US HERE GET IT
MarcelDicke_2010G FROM LIVESTOCK FROM FISH FROM GAME AND WE EAT QUITE A LOT OF IT IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD IT'S ON AVERAGE EIGHTY KG PER PERSON PER YEAR
MarcelDicke_2010G WHICH GOES UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY IN THE UNITED STATES AND A BIT LOWER IN SOME OTHER COUNTRIES BUT ON AVERAGE EIGHTY KG PER PERSON PER YEAR
MarcelDicke_2010G AND IT'S STILL INCREASING SO IF A THIRD OF THE WORLD POPULATION IS GOING TO INCREASE ITS MEAT CONSUMPTION
MarcelDicke_2010G OF COURSE WE ARE NOT THERE TO SAY IT'S ONLY FOR US IT'S NOT FOR THEM THEY HAVE THE SAME SHARE THAT WE HAVE
MarcelDicke_2010G TO START WITH I SHOULD SAY THAT WE ARE EATING WAY TOO MUCH MEAT IN THE WESTERN WORLD WE COULD DO WITH MUCH MUCH LESS AND I KNOW I'VE BEEN A VEGETARIAN FOR A LONG TIME
MarcelDicke_2010G FIRST PROBLEM THAT WE'RE FACING IS HUMAN HEALTH PIGS ARE QUITE LIKE US THEY'RE EVEN MODELS IN MEDICINE AND WE CAN EVEN TRANSPLANT ORGANS FROM A PIG TO A HUMAN
MarcelDicke_2010G THAT MEANS THAT PIGS ALSO SHARE DISEASES WITH US AND A PIG DISEASE A PIG VIRUS AND A HUMAN VIRUS CAN BOTH PROLIFERATE AND BECAUSE OF THEIR KIND OF REPRODUCTION THEY CAN
MarcelDicke_2010G COMBINE AND PRODUCE A NEW VIRUS THIS HAS HAPPENED IN THE NETHERLANDS IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES DURING THE CLASSICAL SWINE FEVER OUTBREAK YOU GET A NEW DISEASE THAT CAN BE DEADLY
MarcelDicke_2010G WE EAT INSECTS THEY'RE SO DISTANTLY RELATED FROM US THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN SO THAT'S ONE POINT FOR INSECTS
MarcelDicke_2010G WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH TEN KG OF INPUT YOU CAN GET EITHER ONE OR NINE KG OF OUTPUT SO FAR WE'RE TAKING THE
MarcelDicke_2010G OR UP TO FIVE KG OF OUTPUT WE'RE NOT TAKING THE BONUS YET WE'RE NOT TAKING THE NINE KG OF OUTPUT YET SO THAT'S TWO POINTS FOR INSECTS
MarcelDicke_2010G SO LESS WASTE FURTHERMORE PER KG OF MANURE YOU HAVE MUCH MUCH LESS AMMONIA AND FEWER GREENHOUSE GASES WHEN YOU HAVE INSECT MANURE THAN WHEN YOU HAVE COW MANURE
MarcelDicke_2010G SO YOU HAVE LESS WASTE AND THE WASTE THAT YOU HAVE IS NOT AS ENVIRONMENTAL MALIGN AS IT IS WITH COW DUNG SO THAT'S THREE POINTS FOR INSECTS
MarcelDicke_2010G HAVE BEEN ALL KINDS OF ANALYSESE AND IN TERMS OF PROTEIN OR FAT OR VITAMINS IT'S VERY GOOD IN FACT IT'S COMPARABLE
MarcelDicke_2010G TO ANYTHING WE EAT AS MEAT AT THE MOMENT AND EVEN IN TERMS OF CALORIES IT IS VERY GOOD ONE KG OF GRASSHOPPERS HAS THE SAME AMOUNT OF CALORIES AS TEN HOT DOGS OR SIX BIG MACS SO THAT'S FOUR POINTS FOR INSECTS
MarcelDicke_2010G I CAN GO ON AND I COULD MAKE MANY MORE POINTS FOR INSECTS BUT TIME DOESN'T ALLOW THIS SO THE QUESTION IS WHY NOT EAT INSECTS I GAVE YOU AT LEAST FOUR ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR WE'LL HAVE TO
MarcelDicke_2010G EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU'LL HAVE TO GET USED TO THIS BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT SEVENTY PERCENT OF ALL OUR AGRICULTURAL LAND IS BEING USED TO PRODUCE LIVESTOCK THAT'S NOT ONLY THE LAND WHERE THE LIVESTOCK IS WALKING
MarcelDicke_2010G AND FEEDING BUT IT'S ALSO OTHER AREAS WHERE THE FEED IS BEING PRODUCED AND BEING TRANSPORTED
MarcelDicke_2010G WE CAN INCREASE IT A BIT AT THE EXPENSE OF RAINFORESTS BUT THERE'S A LIMITATION VERY SOON
MarcelDicke_2010G YOU REMEMBER THAT WE NEED TO INCREASE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION BY SEVENTY PERCENT WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THAT WAY WE COULD MUCH BETTER FROM MEAT FROM BEEF TO INSECTS
MarcelDicke_2010G AND THEN EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE WORLD ALREADY EATS INSECTS SO WE ARE JUST A MINORITY IN A COUNTRY LIKE THE U K THE USA THE NETHERLANDS ANYWHERE
MarcelDicke_2010G ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE YOU SEE A MARKET IN LAOS WHERE THEY HAVE ABUNDANTLY PRESENT ALL KINDS OF INSECTS THAT YOU CHOOSE FOR DINNER FOR THE NIGHT ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE YOU SEE A GRASSHOPPER
MarcelDicke_2010G SO PEOPLE THERE ARE EATING THEM NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE HUNGRY BUT BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S A DELICACY IT'S JUST VERY GOOD FOOD
MarcelDicke_2010G YOU CAN VARY ENORMOUSLY IT HAS MANY BENEFITS IN FACT WE HAVE DELICACY THAT'S VERY MUCH LIKE THIS GRASSHOPPER
MarcelDicke_2010G A DELICACY BEING SOLD AT A HIGH PRICE WHO WOULDN'T LIKE TO EAT A SHRIMP THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE SHRIMP BUT SHRIMP
MarcelDicke_2010G OR CRABS OR CRAYFISH ARE VERY CLOSELY RELATED THEY ARE DELICACIES IN FACT A LOCUST IS A SHRIMP OF THE LAND AND IT WOULD MAKE VERY GOOD INTO OUR
MarcelDicke_2010G SO WHY ARE WE NOT EATING INSECTS YET WELL THAT'S JUST A MATTER OF MINDSET WE'RE NOT USED TO IT AND WE SEE INSECTS AS THESE ORGANISMS THAT ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM US THAT'S WHY WE'RE CHANGING THE PERCEPTION OF INSECTS AND I'M WORKING VERY HARD WITH MY COLLEAGUE
MarcelDicke_2010G IN TELLING PEOPLE WHAT INSECTS ARE WHAT MAGNIFICENT THINGS THEY ARE WHAT MAGNIFICENT JOBS THEY DO IN NATURE AND IN FACT WITHOUT INSECTS WE WOULD NOT BE HERE IN THIS ROOM
MarcelDicke_2010G BECAUSE IF THE INSECTS DIE OUT WE WILL SOON DIE OUT AS WELL IF WE DIE OUT THE INSECTS WILL CONTINUE VERY
MarcelDicke_2010G MAYBE BY TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY YOU'LL BUY THEM JUST KNOWING THAT THIS IS AN INSECT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO EAT AND THEY'RE BEING MADE IN THE MOST WONDERFUL WAYS A DUTCH CHOCOLATE MAKER
MarcelDicke_2010G WELL IN THE NETHERLANDS WE HAVE AN INNOVATIVE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND SHE PUTS THE INSECTS ON THE MENU IN HER RESTAURANT IN HER MINISTRY AND WHEN SHE GOT ALL THE MINISTERS OF AGRICULTURE OF THE E U OVER TO THE HAGUE RECENTLY
MarcelDicke_2010G SHE WENT TO A HIGH CLASS RESTAURANT AND THEY ATE INSECTS ALL TOGETHER
MarcelDicke_2010G AND THEY ATE INSECTS AT THE SAME MOMENT AND THIS WAS STILL BIG BIG NEWS I THINK SOON IT WILL NOT BE BIG NEWS ANYMORE WHEN WE ALL EAT INSECTS BECAUSE IT'S JUST A NORMAL WAY OF DOING SO YOU CAN TRY IT YOURSELF
MarcelDicke_2010G TODAY AND I WOULD SAY ENJOY AND I'M GOING TO SHOW TO BRUNO SOME FIRST TRIES AND HE CAN HAVE THE FIRST
