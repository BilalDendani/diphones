KristinaGjerde_2010Z@17.68:23.04 TAKE YOU ON A VOYAGE TO SOME PLACE SO DEEP SO DARK SO UNEXPLORED
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@23.43:32.62 WE KNOW LESS ABOUT IT THAN WE KNOW ABOUT THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON IT'S A PLACE OF MYTH AND LEGEND IT'S A PLACE MARKED ON ANCIENT MAPS AS HERE BE MONSTERS
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@33.53:41.51 IT IS A PLACE WHERE EACH NEW VOYAGE OF EXPLORATION BRINGS BACK NEW DISCOVERIES OF CREATURES SO WONDROUS AND STRANGE THAT OUR FOREFATHERS WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED THEM
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@42.03:53.38 MONSTROUS INDEED INSTEAD THEY JUST MAKE ME GREEN WITH ENVY THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM IUCN WAS ABLE TO GO ON THIS JOURNEY TO THE SOUTH OF MADAGASCAR SEAMOUNTS TO ACTUALLY TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS AND TO SEE THESE WONDROUS CREATURES OF THE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@55.07:62.60 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE HIGH SEAS THE HIGH SEAS IS A LEGAL TERM BUT IN FACT IT COVERS FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PLANET
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@62.99:75.01 WITH AN AVERAGE DEPTH OF THE OCEANS OF FOUR THOUSAND METERS IN FACT THE HIGH SEAS COVERS AND PROVIDES NEARLY NINETY PERCENT OF THE HABITAT FOR LIFE ON THIS EARTH
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@75.78:83.95 IT IS IN THEORY THE GLOBAL COMMONS BELONGING TO US ALL BUT IN REALITY IT IS MANAGED BY AND FOR THOSE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@84.45:95.32 WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GO OUT AND EXPLOIT IT SO TODAY I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU ON A VOYAGE TO CAST LIGHT ON SOME OF THE OUTDATED MYTHS AND LEGENDS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT HAVE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@96.06:107.22 US AS THE TRUE STAKE HOLDERS IN THE HIGH SEAS IN THE DARK WE'RE GOING TO VOYAGE TO SOME OF THESE SPECIAL PLACES THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCOVERING IN THE PAST FEW YEARS TO SHOW WHY WE REALLY NEED TO CARE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@107.60:122.25 AND THEN FINALLY WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DEVELOP AND PIONEER A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON HIGH SEAS GOVERNANCE THAT'S ROOTED IN OCEAN BASIN WIDE CONSERVATION BUT FRAMED IN AN ARENA OF GLOBAL NORMS OF PRECAUTION AND RESPECT
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@122.82:134.49 SO HERE IS A PICTURE OF THE HIGH SEAS AS SEEN FROM ABOVE THAT AREA IN THE DARKER BLUE TO ME AS AN INTERNATIONAL LAWYER THIS SCARED ME FAR MORE THAN ANY OF THE CREATURES OR THE MONSTERS WE MAY HAVE SEEN
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@134.93:142.65 FOR IT BELIES THE NOTION THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY PROTECT THE OCEAN THE GLOBAL OCEAN THAT PROVIDES US ALL WITH CARBON STORAGE WITH HEAT
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@143.45:149.87 STORAGE WITH OXYGEN IF YOU CAN ONLY PROTECT THIRTY SIX PERCENT THIS IS INDEED THE TRUE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@153.20:162.03 SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE TO CONFRONT ARE THAT THE CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LAWS FOR EXAMPLE SHIPPING PROVIDE MORE PROTECTION TO THE AREAS CLOSEST TO SHORE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@162.37:171.59 FOR EXAMPLE GARBAGE DISCHARGE SOMETHING YOU WOULD THINK JUST SIMPLE GOES AWAY BUT THE LAWS REGULATING SHIP DISCHARGE OF GARBAGE ACTUALLY GET WEAKER
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@171.74:179.77 THE FARTHER YOU ARE FROM SHORE AS A RESULT WE HAVE GARBAGE PATCHES TWICE THE SIZE OF TEXAS
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@180.43:189.44 IT'S UNBELIEVABLE WE USED TO THINK THE SOLUTION TO POLLUTION WAS DILUTION BUT THAT HAS PROVED TO BE NO LONGER THE CASE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@190.27:198.87 SO WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM SOCIAL SCIENTISTS AND ECONOMISTS LIKE ELINOR OSTROM WHO ARE STUDYING THE PHENOMENON OF MANAGEMENT OF THE COMMONS ON A LOCAL SCALE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@199.15:208.33 IS THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN PREREQUISITES THAT YOU CAN PUT INTO PLACE THAT ENABLE YOU TO MANAGE AND ACCESS OPEN SPACE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@208.93:217.55 FOR THE GOOD OF ONE AND ALL AND THESE INCLUDE A SENSE OF SHARED RESPONSIBILITY COMMON NORMS THAT BIND PEOPLE TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@224.10:233.23 AND OF COURSE IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO PLAY BY THE RULES YOU STILL NEED AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT FOR AS WE'VE DISCOVERED YOU CAN TRUST BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO VERIFY
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@233.70:245.62 WHAT I'D ALSO LIKE TO CONVEY IS THAT IT IS NOT ALL DOOM AND GLOOM THAT WE ARE SEEING ON THE HIGH SEAS FOR A GROUP OF VERY DEDICATED INDIVIDUALS SCIENTISTS CONSERVATIONISTS PHOTOGRAPHERS
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@246.13:260.51 AND STATES WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY CHANGE A TRAGIC TRAJECTORY THAT WAS DESTROYING FRAGILE SEASCAPES SUCH AS THIS CORAL GARDEN THAT YOU SEE IN FRONT OF YOU THAT IS WE'RE ABLE TO SAVE IT FROM A FATE OF DEEP SEA BOTTOM TRAWLING
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@261.19:268.99 AND HOW DID WE DO THAT WELL AS I SAID WE HAD A GROUP OF PHOTOGRAPHERS THAT WENT OUT ON BOARD SHIPS AND ACTUALLY PHOTOGRAPHED THE ACTIVITIES IN PROCESS
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@269.35:281.73 WE ALSO SPENT MANY HOURS IN THE BASEMENTS OF THE UNITED NATIONS TRYING TO WORK WITH GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON SO FAR AWAY FROM LAND THAT FEW OF US HAD EVER EVEN IMAGINED THAT THESE CREATURES EXISTED
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@282.48:294.44 SO WITHIN THREE YEARS FROM TWO THOUSAND AND THREE TO TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WE WERE ABLE TO GET NORM IN PLACE THAT ACTUALLY CHANGED THE PARADIGM OF HOW FISHERS WENT ABOUT DEEP SEA BOTTOM TRAWLING
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@315.60:326.18 THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT'S THE FINAL SOLUTION OR THAT THIS EVEN PROVIDES PERMANENT PROTECTION BUT WHAT IT DOES MEAN IS THAT A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS CAN FORM A COMMUNITY TO ACTUALLY SHAPE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@326.56:337.98 THE WAY HIGH SEAS AGE GOVERNED TO CREATE A NEW REGIME SO I'M LOOKING OPTIMISTICALLY AT OUR OPPORTUNITIES FOR CREATING A TRUE BLUE PERSPECTIVE FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@339.23:341.22 SYLVIA 'S WISH PROVIDES US WITH THAT
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@345.70:350.68 HUMAN BEINGS YOU MIGHT SAY WHO HAVE RARELY SEEN PLACES BEYOND THEIR OWN TOES
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@351.14:360.56 BUT ARE NOW HOPEFULLY GOING TO BECOME INTERESTED IN THE FULL LIFE CYCLE OF CREATURES LIKE THESE SEA TURTLES WHO INDEED SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME IN THE HIGH SEAS
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@361.33:370.23 TODAY WE'RE JUST GOING TO VOYAGE TO A SMALL SAMPLING OF SOME OF THESE SPECIAL AREAS JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE FLAVOR OF THE RICHES AND WONDERS THEY DO CONTAIN
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@370.98:377.36 THE SARGASSO SEA FOR EXAMPLE IS NOT A SEA BOUNDED BY COASTLINES BUT IT IS BOUNDED BY OCEANIC CURRENTS
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@377.77:386.45 THAT CONTAIN AND ENVELOPE THIS WEALTH OF SARGASSUM THAT GROWS AND AGGREGATES THERE IT'S ALSO KNOWN AS THE SPAWNING GROUND
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@386.98:399.10 FOR EELS FROM NORTHERN EUROPEAN AND NORTHERN AMERICAN RIVERS THAT ARE NOW SO DWINDLING IN NUMBERS THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY STOPPED SHOWING UP IN STOCKHOLM AND FIVE SHOWED UP IN THE U K JUST RECENTLY
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@399.44:408.57 BUT THE SARGASSO SEA THE SAME WAY IT AGGREGATES SARGASSUM WEED ACTUALLY IS PULLING IN THE PLASTIC FROM THROUGHOUT THE REGION THIS PICTURE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@416.19:424.91 IN FEBRUARY THAT SHOWED THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PIECES OF PLASTIC PER SQUARE KILOMETER NOW FLOATING ON THE SURFACE OF THE SARGASSO SEA
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@425.46:434.13 AND THAT IS AFFECTING THE HABITAT FOR THE MANY SPECIES IN THEIR JUVENILE STAGES WHO COME TO THE SARGASSO SEA FOR ITS PROTECTION AND ITS FOOD
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@435.36:448.20 THE SARGASSO SEA IS ALSO A WONDROUS PLACE FOR THE AGGREGATION OF THESE UNIQUE SPECIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED TO MIMIC THE SARGASSUM HABITAT IT ALSO PROVIDES A SPECIAL HABITAT FOR THESE FLYING FISH TO LAY THEIR EGGS
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@448.60:455.89 BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO GET FROM THIS PICTURE IS THAT WE TRULY DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LAUNCH A GLOBAL INITIATIVE FOR PROTECTION
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@466.55:475.64 TO HELP SPEARHEAD A MOVEMENT TO ACHIEVE PROTECTION FOR THIS VITAL AREA SPINNING DOWN TO SOMEPLACE A LITTLE BIT COOLER THAN HERE RIGHT NOW THE ROSS SEA IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@475.93:490.30 IT'S ACTUALLY A BAY IT'S CONSIDERED HIGH SEAS BECAUSE THE CONTINENT HAS BEEN PUT OFF LIMITS TO TERRITORIAL CLAIMS SO ANYTHING IN THE WATER IS TREATED AS IF IT'S THE HIGH SEAS BUT WHAT MAKES THE ROSS SEA IMPORTANT IS THE VAST SEA
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@490.83:502.06 PACK ICE THAT IN THE SPRING AND SUMMER PROVIDES A WEALTH OF PHYTOPLANKTON AND KRILL THAT SUPPORTS WHAT TIL RECENTLY HAS BEEN A VIRTUALLY INTACT NEAR SHORE ECOSYSTEM
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@502.48:510.73 BUT UNFORTUNATELY CAMLAR THE REGIONAL COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF CONSERVING AND MANAGING FISH STOCKS AND OTHER LIVING MARINE RESOURCES
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@510.99:518.98 IS UNFORTUNATELY STARTING TO GIVE IN TO FISHING INTERESTS AND HAS AUTHORIZED THE EXPANSION OF TOOTHFISH FISHERIES IN THE REGION
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@519.52:532.54 THE CAPTAIN OF A NEW ZEALAND VESSEL WHO WAS JUST DOWN THERE IS REPORTING A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF THE ROSS SEA KILLER WHALES WHO ARE DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON THE ANTARCTIC TOOTHFISH AS THEIR MAIN SOURCE OF FOOD
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@533.23:543.06 SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO STAND UP BOLDLY SINGLY AND TOGETHER TO PUSH GOVERNMENTS TO PUSH REGIONAL FISHERIES MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATIONS TO DECLARE OUR RIGHT
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@543.27:551.03 TO DECLARE CERTAIN AREAS OFF LIMITS TO HIGH SEAS FISHING SO THAT THE FREEDOM TO FISH NO LONGER MEANS THE FREEDOM TO FISH ANYWHERE AND ANYTIME
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@561.01:571.41 THE SUMMER AND THE WINTER LONG BUT WHAT'S UNUSUAL ABOUT THE COSTA RICA DOME IS IN FACT IT'S NOT A PERMANENT PLACE IT'S AN OCEANOGRAPHIC PHENOMENON THAT SHIFTS IN TIME AND SPACE ON A SEASONAL BASIS
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@571.84:583.87 SO IN FACT IT'S NOT PERMANENTLY IN THE HIGH SEAS IT'S NOT PERMANENTLY IN THE EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONES OF THESE FIVE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES BUT IT MOVES WITH THE SEASON AS SUCH IT DOES CREATE A CHALLENGE TO PROTECT
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@584.72:590.91 BUT WE ALSO HAVE A CHALLENGE PROTECTING THE SPECIES THAT MOVE ALONG WITH IT WE CAN USE THE SAME TECHNOLOGIES THAT FISHERS USE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@612.22:622.01 THIS IS THE INITIATIVE THAT'S BEEN COORDINATED BY CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL WITH A VARIETY OF PARTNERS AND GOVERNMENTS TO ACTUALLY TRY TO BRING INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT REGIME THROUGHOUT THE AREA
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@623.01:629.68 IT PROVIDES A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF WHERE YOU CAN GO WITH A REAL REGIONAL INITIATIVE IT'S PROTECTING FIVE WORLD HERITAGE SITES
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@638.88:649.98 PLACE LIKE THE COSTA RICA DOME COULD NOT TECHNICALLY QUALIFY THE TIME IT'S IN THE HIGH SEAS SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN SUGGESTING IS THAT WE EITHER NEED TO AMEND THE WORLD HERITAGE CONVENTION
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@650.22:657.95 SO THAT IT CAN ADOPT AND URGE UNIVERSAL PROTECTION OF THESE WORLD HERITAGE SITES OR WE NEED TO CHANGE THE NAME AND CALL IT
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@658.39:667.41 THE WORLD HERITAGE CONVENTION BUT WE ALSO KNOW IS THAT SPECIES LIKE THESE SEA TURTLES DO NOT STAY PUT IN THE EASTERN TROPICAL PACIFIC SEASCAPE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@667.77:674.79 THESE HAPPEN TO GO DOWN TO A VAST SOUTH PACIFIC GYRE WHERE THEY SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME AND OFTEN END UP GETTING HOOKED LIKE THIS
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@676.84:683.89 SO WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE TO SUGGEST IS THAT WE NEED TO SCALE UP WE NEED TO WORK LOCALLY BUT WE ALSO NEED TO WORK OCEAN BASIN WIDE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@684.57:691.66 WE HAVE THE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES NOW TO ENABLE US TO TAKE A BROADER OCEAN BASIN WIDE INITIATIVE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@691.91:699.15 WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE TAGGING OF PACIFIC PREDATORS PROJECT ONE OF THE SEVENTEEN CENSUS OF MARINE LIFE PROJECTS IT'S PROVIDED US DATA LIKE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@699.83:708.08 OF TINY LITTLE SOOTY SHEARWATERS THAT MAKE THE ENTIRE OCEAN BASIN THEIR HOME THEY FLY SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND KM IN LESS THAN A YEAR
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@708.52:721.86 SO WE HAVE THE TOOLS AND TREASURES COMING FROM THE CENSUS OF MARINE LIFE AND ITS CULMINATING YEAR THAT'S GOING TO BE LAUNCHED IN OCTOBER SO STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER INFORMATION WHAT I FIND SO EXCITING IS THAT THE CENSUS OF MARINE LIFE HAS LOOKED AT MORE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@722.66:731.34 THE TAGGING OF PACIFIC PREDATORS IT'S ALSO LOOKED IN THE REALLY UNEXPLORED MID WATER COLUMN WHERE CREATURES LIKE THIS THIS FLYING SEA CUCUMBER HAVE BEEN FOUND
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@732.30:739.14 AND FORTUNATELY WE'VE BEEN ABLE AS IUCN TO TEAM UP WITH THE CENSUS OF MARINE LIFE AND MANY OF THE SCIENTISTS WORKING THERE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@739.30:748.67 TO ACTUALLY TRY TO TRANSLATE MUCH OF THIS INFORMATION TO POLICYMAKERS WE HAVE THE SUPPORT OF GOVERNMENTS NOW BEHIND US WE'VE BEEN REVEALING THIS INFORMATION THROUGH TECHNICAL WORKSHOPS
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@748.89:760.23 AND THE EXCITING THING IS THAT WE DO HAVE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO MOVE AHEAD TO PROTECT SOME OF THESE SIGNIFICANT HOPE SPOTS HOT SPOTS AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE SAYING YES WE NEED MORE WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@761.12:769.40 BUT MANY OF YOU HAVE SAID IF YOU GET THESE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS OR A REASONABLE REGIME FOR HIGH SEAS FISHERIES MANAGEMENT IN PLACE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ENFORCE IT
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@769.69:776.76 WHICH LEADS ME TO MY SECOND PASSION BESIDES OCEAN SCIENCE WHICH IS OUTER SPACE TECHNOLOGY I WANTED TO BE AN ASTRONAUT
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@777.09:787.14 SO I'VE CONSTANTLY FOLLOWED WHAT ARE THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO MONITOR EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE AND THAT WE HAVE INCREDIBLE TOOLS LIKE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO FOLLOW
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@787.47:799.49 TAGGED SPECIES THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE CYCLES IN THE OPEN OCEAN WE CAN ALSO TAG AND TRACK FISHING VESSELS MANY ALREADY HAVE TRANSPONDERS ON BOARD THAT ALLOW US TO FIND OUT WHERE THEY ARE AND EVEN
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@800.72:809.07 BUT NOT ALL THE VESSELS HAVE THOSE TO DATE IT DOES NOT TAKE TOO MUCH ROCKET SCIENCE TO ACTUALLY TRY TO CREATE NEW LAWS TO MANDATE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@809.27:818.16 IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF ACCESSING OUR HIGH SEAS RESOURCES WE NEED TO KNOW SOMEONE NEEDS TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@819.23:829.38 SO IT BRINGS ME TO MY MAIN TAKE HOME MESSAGE WHICH IS WE CAN AVERT A TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS WE CAN STOP THE COLLISION COURSE OF FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PLANET WITH THE HIGH SEAS
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@829.91:840.98 WE NEED TO THINK BROAD SCALE WE NEED TO THINK GLOBALLY WE NEED TO CHANGE HOW WE ACTUALLY GO ABOUT MANAGING THESE RESOURCES WE NEED TO GET THE NEW PARADIGM OF CAUTION AND RESPECT
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@841.25:851.59 AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO THINK LOCALLY WHICH IS THE JOY AND MARVEL OF SYLVIA 'S HOPE SPOT WISH IS WE CAN SHINE A SPOTLIGHT ON MANY OF THESE PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN AREAS
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@852.26:861.18 AND TO BRING PEOPLE TO THE TABLE IF YOU WILL TO ACTUALLY MAKE THEM FEEL PART OF THIS COMMUNITY THAT TRULY HAS A STAKE IN THEIR FUTURE MANAGEMENT
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@861.61:871.44 AND THIRD IS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT OCEAN BASIN WIDE MANAGEMENT OUT SPECIES ARE OCEAN BASIN WIDE MANY OF THE DEEP SEA COMMUNITIES HAVE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@886.85:897.94 WITHIN THE EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE BUT WE NEED TO SCALE THESE UP WE NEED TO BUILD THEIR CAPACITY SO THEIR LIKE THE SOUTHERN OCEAN WHERE THEY DO HAVE THE TWO PRONGED FISHERIES AND CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@909.24:916.17 IT'S HELPING TO BRING AN INCREDIBLE GROUP OF TALENTED PEOPLE TOGETHER TO REALLY TRY TO SOLVE AND PENETRATE THESE PROBLEMS
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@916.41:924.97 THAT HAVE CREATED OUR OBSTACLES TO MANAGEMENT AND RATIONAL USE OF THIS AREA THAT WAS ONCE SO FAR AWAY AND REMOTE
KristinaGjerde_2010Z@925.61:938.81 SO ON THIS TOUR I HOPE I PROVIDED YOU WITH A NEW PERSPECTIVE OF THE HIGH SEAS ONE THAT IT IS OUR HOME TOO AND THAT WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER IF WE ARE TO MAKE THIS A SUSTAINABLE OCEAN FUTURE FOR US ALL THANK YOU
