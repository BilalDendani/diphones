NathanWolfe_2009@19.25:29.37 MOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE BEGINNINGS OF AIDS THEY'RE GONNA THINK BACK TO THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND CERTAINLY THIS WAS THE DECADE IN WHICH WE DISCOVERED AIDS AND THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES IT HIV
NathanWolfe_2009@29.80:38.21 BUT IN FACT THIS VIRUS CROSSED OVER INTO INTO HUMANS MANY DECADES BEFORE FROM CHIMPANZEES WHERE THE VIRUS ORIGINATED INTO HUMANS WHO HUNT THESE APES
NathanWolfe_2009@38.54:49.12 THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE GREAT DEPRESSION IN BRAZZAVILLE CONGO AT THIS TIME THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WE THINK THAT WERE INFECTED WITH HIV SO I HAVE A COUPLE OF REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS FOR YOU
NathanWolfe_2009@59.60:71.10 HAD WE BEEN THERE IN THE FORTIES AND FIFTIES SIXTIES HAD WE SEEN THIS DISEASE HAD WE UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH IT HOW MIGHT THAT HAVE CHANGED AND COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED THE NATURE OF THE WAY THIS PANDEMIC
NathanWolfe_2009@73.20:83.31 IN FACT THIS IS NOT UNIQUE TO HIV THE VAST MAJORITY OF VIRUSES COME FROM ANIMALS AND YOU CAN KIND OF THINK OF THIS AS A PYRAMID OF THIS BUBBLING UP OF VIRUSES FROM ANIMALS INTO HUMAN POPULATIONS
NathanWolfe_2009@83.60:91.76 BUT ONLY AT THE VERY TOP OF THIS PYRAMID DO THESE THINGS BECOME COMPLETELY HUMAN NEVERTHELESS WE SPEND THE VAST MAJORITY OF OF OUR ENERGY FOCUSED ON THIS LEVEL OF THE PYRAMID
NathanWolfe_2009@92.22:101.68 TRYING TO TACKLE THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY COMPLETELY ADAPTED TO HUMAN BEINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE CASE OF HIV SO DURING THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS I'VE BEEN
NathanWolfe_2009@113.29:120.68 THE MOVEMENT OF THESE AGENTS OVER INTO HUMANS AND BY CAPTURING THIS MOMENT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MOVE TO A SITUATION WHERE WE CAN CATCH THEM EARLY
NathanWolfe_2009@121.07:133.21 OK SO THIS IS A PICTURE AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME PICTURES NOW FROM THE FIELD THIS IS A PICTURE OF A CENTRAL AFRICAN HUNTER IT'S ACTUALLY A FAIRLY COMMON PICTURE ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT YOU TO NOTE FROM IT IS BLOOD THAT YOU SEE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BLOOD CONTACT
NathanWolfe_2009@133.46:142.92 THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY KEY FOR US THIS IS A VERY INTIMATE FORM OF CONNECTION SO IF WE'RE GOING TO STUDY VIRAL CHATTER WE NEED TO GET TO THESE POPULATIONS WHO HAVE INTENSIVE CONTACT WITH WILD ANIMALS
NathanWolfe_2009@152.93:166.92 AND IDEALLY THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW US TO CATCH THESE THINGS EARLY ON AS THEY'RE MOVING OVER INTO HUMAN POPULATIONS AND THE BASIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS NOT TO JUST GO OUT ONCE AND LOOK AT THESE INDIVIDUALS BUT TO ESTABLISH THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THESE POPULATIONS THAT WE WOULD MONITOR
NathanWolfe_2009@181.40:187.44 AND THIS ALLOWS US TO IDENTIFY YET UNKNOWN VIRUSES FROM EXACTLY THE RIGHT ANIMALS THE ONES THAT ARE ACTUALLY BEING HUNTED
NathanWolfe_2009@191.68:195.64 DEEP IN A REMOTE REGION OF CAMEROON TWO HUNTERS STALK THEIR PREY
NathanWolfe_2009@196.15:199.76 THEIR NAMES ARE PATRICE AND PATEE THEY'RE SEARCHING FOR BUSH MEAT
NathanWolfe_2009@210.23:218.29 HAVE A SERIES OF TRAPS OF SNARES THAT THEY'VE SET UP TO CATCH WILD PIGS SNAKES MONKEYS RODENTS ANYTHING THEY CAN
NathanWolfe_2009@220.49:223.59 PATRICE AND PATEE HAVE BEEN OUT FOR HOURS BUT FOUND NOTHING
NathanWolfe_2009@226.28:228.40 THE ANIMALS ARE SIMPLY GONE
NathanWolfe_2009@230.35:231.97 WE STOP FOR A DRINK OF WATER
NathanWolfe_2009@236.01:238.07 THEN THERE IS A RUSTLE IN THE BRUSH
NathanWolfe_2009@240.59:242.37 GROUP OF HUNTERS APPROACH
NathanWolfe_2009@245.43:247.57 THEIR PACKS LOADED WITH WILD GAME
NathanWolfe_2009@283.18:294.42 FROM THIS ANIMAL RIGHT HERE GREATER SPOT NOSED GUENON EVERY PERSON WHO HAS ONE OF THOSE FILTER PAPERS HAS AT LEAST AT A MINIMUM BEEN THROUGH OUR BASIC HEALTH EDUCATION ABOUT THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ACTIVITIES WHICH
NathanWolfe_2009@305.18:314.99 OK BEFORE I CONTINUE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE JUST A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT BUSHMEAT BUSHMEAT IS THE HUNTING OF WILD GAME OK AND YOU CAN CONSIDER ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT BUSHMEAT I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THIS
NathanWolfe_2009@342.54:349.84 AND THAT OTHER DISEASES HAD THE POTENTIAL TO ENTER LIKE THIS WHY DID WE LET THESE BEHAVIORS CONTINUE WHY DID WE NOT FIND SOME OTHER SOLUTION TO THIS THEY'RE GOING TO SAY
NathanWolfe_2009@350.06:360.62 IN REGIONS OF PROFOUND INSTABILITY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE INTENSE POVERTY WHERE POPULATIONS ARE GROWING AND YOU DON'T HAVE SUSTAINABLE RESOURCES LIKE THIS THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO FOOD INSECURITY
NathanWolfe_2009@384.25:397.04 BUSHMEAT IS ONE OF THE CENTRAL CRISES WHICH IS OCCURRING IN OUR POPULATION RIGHT NOW IN HUMANITY ON THIS PLANET BUT IT CAN'T BE THE FAULT OF SOMEBODY LIKE THIS OK AND SOLVING IT CANNOT BE HIS RESPONSIBILITY ALONE
NathanWolfe_2009@397.63:403.70 THERE'S NO EASY SOLUTIONS BUT WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU IS THAT WE NEGLECT THIS PROBLEM AT OUR OWN PERIL SO
NathanWolfe_2009@414.87:419.16 MY JOB AT THAT TIME I WAS A POST DOCTORAL FELLOW AND I WAS REALLY TASKED WITH SETTING THIS UP
NathanWolfe_2009@419.58:429.56 SO I SAID TO MYSELF OK GREAT WE'RE GONNA COLLECT ALL KINDS OF SPECIMENS WE'RE GONNA GO TO ALL THESE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IT'S GOING TO BE WONDERFUL YOU KNOW I LOOKED AT THE MAP I PICKED OUT SEVENTEEN SITES I FIGURED NO PROBLEM
NathanWolfe_2009@444.11:450.59 WE HAVE A WHOLE RANGE OF CHALLENGES ABOUT THIS WORK ONE OF THEM IS JUST OBTAINING TRUST FROM INDIVIDUALS THAT WE WORK WITH IN THE FIELD
NathanWolfe_2009@450.95:460.58 THE PERSON YOU SEE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE IS PAUL DELONG MINUTU HE 'S ONE OF THE BEST COMMUNICATORS THAT I'VE REALLY EVER DEALT WITH WHEN I ARRIVED I DIDN'T SPEAK A WORD OF FRENCH AND I STILL SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS HE WAS SAYING
NathanWolfe_2009@462.07:469.85 WORKED FOR YEARS ON THE CAMEROONIAN NATIONAL RADIO AND TELEVISION AND HE SPOKE ABOUT HEALTH ISSUES HE WAS A HEALTH CORESPONDENT SO WE FIGURED WE'D HIRE THIS PERSON
NathanWolfe_2009@480.51:492.77 WHEN HE BEGAN TO SPEAK THEY WOULD ACTUALLY RECOGNIZE HIS VOICE FROM THE RADIO AND THIS WAS SOMEBODY WHO HAD INCREDIBLE POTENTIAL TO SPREAD ASPECTS OF OUR MESSAGE WHETHER IT BE WITH REGARDS TO WILDLIFE CONSERVATION OR HEALTH PREVENTION
NathanWolfe_2009@494.50:508.54 OFTEN WE RUN INTO OBSTACLES THIS IS US COMING BACK FROM ONE OF THESE VERY RURAL SITES WITH SPECIMENS FROM TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS THAT WE NEEDED TO GET BACK TO THE LAB WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS I LIKE TO SHOW THIS SHOT THIS IS UBALD TAMOUFE WHO 'S THE LEAD INVESTIGATOR IN OUR CAMEROON SITE
NathanWolfe_2009@519.28:520.04 WHICH HE DID
NathanWolfe_2009@521.27:525.42 JUST A FEW QUICK BEFORE AND AFTER SHOTS THIS WAS OUR LABORATORY BEFORE
NathanWolfe_2009@526.46:527.85 THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE NOW
NathanWolfe_2009@528.86:542.36 EARLY ON IN ORDER TO SHIP OUR SPECIMENS WE HAD TO HAVE DRY ICE TO GET DRY ICE WE HAD TO GO TO THE BREWERIES BEG BORROW STEAL TO GET THESE FOLKS TO GIVE IT TO US NOW WE HAVE OUR OWN LIQUID NITROGEN I LIKE TO CALL OUR LABORATORY THE COLDEST PLACE IN CENTRAL AFRICA IT MIGHT BE
NathanWolfe_2009@543.44:546.05 AND HERE 'S A SHOT OF ME THIS IS THE BEFORE SHOT OF ME
NathanWolfe_2009@548.91:549.82 NO COMMENT
NathanWolfe_2009@550.91:558.08 SO WHAT HAPPENED SO DURING THE TEN YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK WE ACTUALLY SURPRISED OURSELVES WE MADE A NUMBER OF
NathanWolfe_2009@559.23:567.98 AND WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS THAT IF YOU LOOK IN THE RIGHT PLACE YOU CAN ACTUALLY MONITOR THE FLOW OF THESE VIRUSES INTO HUMAN POPULATIONS THAT GAVE US A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HOPE WHAT WE'VE FOUND
NathanWolfe_2009@568.28:575.66 A WHOLE RANGE OF NEW VIRUSES IN THESE INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING NEW VIRUSES IN THE SAME GROUP AS HIV SO BRAND NEW RETROVIRUSES
NathanWolfe_2009@575.88:584.21 AND LET 'S FACE IT ANY NEW RETROVIRUS IN THE HUMAN POPULATION IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE FOLLOWING IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE SURPRISED BY
NathanWolfe_2009@594.71:600.16 AND CRITICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IN CENTRAL AFRICA DOESN'T STAY IN CENTRAL AFRICA
NathanWolfe_2009@601.60:610.86 SO ONCE WE DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS REALLY POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY DO THIS MONITORING WE DECIDED TO MOVE THIS FROM RESEARCH TO REALLY ATTEMPT TO PHASE UP TO A GLOBAL MONITORING EFFORT
NathanWolfe_2009@611.40:623.61 THROUGH GENEROUS SUPPORT AND PARTNERSHIP SCIENTIFICALLY WITH GOOGLE ORG AND THE SKOLL FOUNDATION WE WERE ABLE TO START THE GLOBAL VIRAL FORECASTING INITIATIVE AND BEGIN WORK IN FOUR DIFFERENT SITES IN AFRICA AND ASIA
NathanWolfe_2009@638.40:647.59 BUT REALLY THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE OUR OBJECTIVE RIGHT NOW IN ADDITION TO DEPLOYING TO THESE SITES AND GETTING EVERYTHING MOVING IS TO IDENTIFY NEW PARTNERS BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE THIS
NathanWolfe_2009@647.96:656.71 EFFORT NEEDS TO BE EXTENDED TO PROBABLY TWENTY OR MORE SITES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO VIRAL HOTSPOTS BECAUSE REALLY THE IDEA HERE IS TO CAST AN INCREDIBLY WIDE NET
NathanWolfe_2009@656.96:664.35 SO THAT WE CAN CATCH THESE THINGS IDEALLY BEFORE THEY MAKE IT TO BLOOD BANKS SEXUAL NETWORKS AIRPLANES AND THAT'S REALLY OUR OBJECTIVE
NathanWolfe_2009@664.83:674.79 THERE WAS A TIME NOT VERY LONG AGO WHEN THE DISCOVERY OF UNKNOWN ORGANISMS WAS SOMETHING THAT HELD INCREDIBLE AWE FOR US IT HAD POTENTIAL TO REALLY CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE SAW OURSELVES
NathanWolfe_2009@675.03:680.69 AND THOUGHT ABOUT OURSELVES MANY PEOPLE I THINK ON OUR PLANET RIGHT NOW DESPAIR AND THEY THINK
NathanWolfe_2009@681.60:692.53 WE'VE REACHED A POINT WHERE WE'VE DISCOVERED MOST OF THE THINGS I'M GOING TELL YOU RIGHT NOW PLEASE DON'T DESPAIR IF AN INTELLIGENT EXTRA TERRESTERIAL WAS TAXED WITH WRITING THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF LIFE ON OUR PLANET
NathanWolfe_2009@714.17:723.32 THE DOMINANT THINGS THAT EXIST HERE WE KNOW ALMOST NOTHING ABOUT AND YET FINALLY WE HAVE THE TOOLS WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO ACTUALLY EXPLORE THAT WORLD AND UNDERSTAND THEM
