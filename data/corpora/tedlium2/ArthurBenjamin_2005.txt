ArthurBenjamin_2005 GOOD MORNING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN MY NAME IS ART BENJAMIN AND I AM A MATHEMAGICIAN WHAT THAT MEANS IS I COMBINE MY LOVES OF MATH AND MAGIC TO DO SOMETHING I CALL
ArthurBenjamin_2005 I SEE I SEE ONE WAY IN THE BACK YOU SIR THAT'S THREE AND ANYBODY ON THIS SIDE HERE OK YOU OVER THERE ON THE AISLE WOULD THE FOUR OF YOU WITH CALCULATORS PLEASE BRING OUT YOUR CALCULATORS THEN JOIN ME UP ON STAGE AND LET 'S GIVE THESE VOLUNTEERS A NICE ROUND OF APPLAUSE
ArthurBenjamin_2005 I HAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE TO WORK WITH THESE CALCULATORS I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ALL WORKING PROPERLY WOULD SOMEBODY GET US STARTED BY GIVING US A TWO DIGIT NUMBER PLEASE HOW ABOUT A TWO DIGIT NUMBER
ArthurBenjamin_2005 WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY A MORE STANDARD CALCULATOR JUST IN CASE OK GREAT WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY AND DO THEN I NOTICE THAT TOOK SOME OF YOU A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO GET YOUR ANSWER THAT'S OK
ArthurBenjamin_2005 I'LL GIVE YOU A SHORTCUT FOR MULTIPLYING EVEN FASTER ON THE CALCULATOR THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED THE SQUARE OF A NUMBER WHICH MOST OF YOU KNOW IS TAKING A NUMBER AND MULTIPLYING IT BY ITSELF FOR INSTANCE FIVE SQUARED WOULD BE
ArthurBenjamin_2005 AND ON MOST CALCULATORS THAT WILL GIVE YOU THE SQUARE ON SOME OF THESE ANCIENT RPN CALCULATORS YOU'VE GOT AN X SQUARED BUTTON ON IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO DO THE CALCULATION EVEN FASTER WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY AND DO NOW IS TO SQUARE IN MY HEAD FOUR TWO DIGIT NUMBERS
ArthurBenjamin_2005 FASTER THAN THEY CAN DO ON THEIR CALCULATORS EVEN USING THE SHORTCUT METHOD WHAT I'LL USE IS THE SECOND ROW THIS TIME AND I'LL GET FOUR OF YOU ONE TWO THREE FOUR
ArthurBenjamin_2005 YELL OUT A TWO DIGIT NUMBER AND IF YOU WOULD SQUARE THE FIRST NUMBER AND IF YOU WOULD SQUARE THE SECOND THE THIRD AND THE
ArthurBenjamin_2005 I WILL TRY AND RACE YOU TO THE ANSWER OK SO QUICKLY A TWO DIGIT NUMBER PLEASE
ArthurBenjamin_2005 LET ME TRY TO TAKE THIS ONE STEP FURTHER I'M GOING TO TRY TO SQUARE SOME THREE DIGIT NUMBERS THIS TIME I WON 'T EVEN WRITE THESE DOWN I'LL JUST CALL THEM OUT AS THEY'RE CALLED OUT TO ME ANYONE I POINT TO CALL OUT A THREE DIGIT NUMBER
ArthurBenjamin_2005 ANOTHER ANOTHER THREE DIGIT ANOTHER
ArthurBenjamin_2005 ANOTHER ANOTHER THREE DIGIT NUMBER SIR
ArthurBenjamin_2005 LET ME TRY TO TAKE THIS ONE STEP FURTHER
ArthurBenjamin_2005 I'M GOING TO TRY TO SQUARE A FOUR DIGIT NUMBER THIS TIME NOW YOU CAN ALL TAKE YOUR TIME ON THIS I WILL NOT BEAT YOU TO THE ANSWER ON THIS ONE BUT I WILL TRY TO GET THE ANSWER RIGHT
ArthurBenjamin_2005 NINE AB NINE SEVEN SEVEN FIVE
ArthurBenjamin_2005 THAT DOES YOURS GO
ArthurBenjamin_2005 IN THE MEANWHILE LET ME CONCLUDE
ArthurBenjamin_2005 SO YOU SHOULD HAVE AS AN ANSWER EITHER A SIX DIGIT OR PROBABLY A SEVEN DIGIT NUMBER HOW MANY DIGITS DO YOU HAVE SIX OR SEVEN SEVEN AND YOURS
ArthurBenjamin_2005 I SHALL ATTEMPT THE IMPOSSIBLE OR AT LEAST THE IMPROBABLE
ArthurBenjamin_2005 THE ODDS OF ME GETTING ALL FOUR OF THESE RIGHT BY RANDOM GUESSING WOULD BE ONE IN TEN THOUSAND TEN TO THE FOURTH POWER OK ANY SIX OF THEM
ArthurBenjamin_2005 REALLY SCRAMBLE THEM UP
ArthurBenjamin_2005 YOU LEAVE OUT THE NUMBER SEVEN AND LET 'S GIVE ALL FOUR OF THESE PEOPLE

ArthurBenjamin_2005 WAS A GENTLEMAN UP HERE WHO HAD A TEN DIGIT CALCULATOR WHERE IS HE WOULD YOU STAND UP TEN DIGIT GUY OK WELL STAND UP FOR ME JUST FOR A SECOND SO I CAN SEE WHERE
ArthurBenjamin_2005 YOU HAVE A TEN DIGIT CALCULATOR SIR AS WELL OK WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY AND DO IS TO SQUARE IN MY HEAD A FIVE DIGIT NUMBER REQUIRING A TEN DIGIT CALCULATOR
ArthurBenjamin_2005 BUT TO MAKE MY JOB MORE INTERESTING FOR YOU AS WELL AS FOR ME I'M GOING TO DO THIS PROBLEM THINKING OUT LOUD
ArthurBenjamin_2005 SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY HONESTLY HEAR WHAT'S GOING ON IN MY MIND WHILE I DO A CALCULATION OF THIS SIZE

ArthurBenjamin_2005 WHILE I EXPLAIN SOMETHING ELSE
ArthurBenjamin_2005 I KNOW THAT YOU CAN USE RIGHT
ArthurBenjamin_2005 WHILE I DO THESE CALCULATION YOU MIGHT
ArthurBenjamin_2005 WORDS AS OPPOSED TO NUMBERS CREEP INTO THE CALCULATION LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS THIS IS A PHONETIC CODE A MNEMONIC DEVICE THAT I USE THAT ALLOWS ME TO CONVERT NUMBERS
ArthurBenjamin_2005 INTO WORDS I STORE THEM AS WORDS AND LATER ON RETRIEVE THEM AS NUMBERS I KNOW IT SOUNDS COMPLICATED IT'S NOT I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK YOU'RE SEEING SOMETHING OUT OF RAIN MAN HERE

ArthurBenjamin_2005 THE CALCULATORS OK YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE THERE IS AT LEAST A FIFTY PERCENT CHANCE THAT I WILL MAKE A MISTAKE HERE IF I DO
ArthurBenjamin_2005 DON'T TELL ME WHAT THE MISTAKE IS JUST SAY YOU 'RE CLOSE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND I'LL TRY AND FIGURE OUT THE ANSWER WHICH COULD BE PRETTY ENTERTAINING IN ITSELF IF
