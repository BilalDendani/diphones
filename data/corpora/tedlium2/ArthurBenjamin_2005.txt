ArthurBenjamin_2005@125.85:140.22 AND ON MOST CALCULATORS THAT WILL GIVE YOU THE SQUARE ON SOME OF THESE ANCIENT RPN CALCULATORS YOU'VE GOT AN X SQUARED BUTTON ON IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO DO THE CALCULATION EVEN FASTER WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY AND DO NOW IS TO SQUARE IN MY HEAD FOUR TWO DIGIT NUMBERS
ArthurBenjamin_2005@140.61:148.07 FASTER THAN THEY CAN DO ON THEIR CALCULATORS EVEN USING THE SHORTCUT METHOD WHAT I'LL USE IS THE SECOND ROW THIS TIME AND I'LL GET FOUR OF YOU ONE TWO THREE FOUR
