JayWalker_2009@27.06:32.85 HYSTERICAL TEENAGERS CRYING SCREAMING PANDEMONIUM
JayWalker_2009@40.38:41.60 ALL FOR ONE IDEA
JayWalker_2009@55.78:57.23 MANIAS CAN BE ALARMING
JayWalker_2009@58.53:61.04 OR MANIAS CAN BE DEADLY
JayWalker_2009@64.30:74.22 THE WORLD HAS A NEW MANIA A MANIA FOR LEARNING ENGLISH LISTEN AS CHINESE STUDENTS PRACTICE THEIR ENGLISH BY SCREAMING IT
JayWalker_2009@101.25:107.29 HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO LEARN ENGLISH WORLDWIDE TWO BILLION OF THEM
JayWalker_2009@111.08:123.67 IN LATIN AMERICA IN INDIA IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND MOST OF ALL IN CHINA IF YOU ARE A CHINESE STUDENT YOU START LEARNING ENGLISH IN THE THIRD GRADE
JayWalker_2009@123.99:132.71 BY LAW THAT'S WHY THIS YEAR CHINA WILL BECOME THE WORLD 'S LARGEST ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRY
JayWalker_2009@134.62:144.13 WHY ENGLISH IN A SINGLE WORD OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITY FOR A BETTER LIFE A JOB TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR SCHOOL OR PUT BETTER FOOD ON THE TABLE
JayWalker_2009@153.46:161.17 SHE STUDIES TWELVE HOURS A DAY FOR THREE YEARS TO PREPARE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF HER GRADE
JayWalker_2009@161.55:169.28 IS BASED ON ENGLISH IT'S CALLED THE GAOKAO AND EIGHTY MILLION HIGH SCHOOL CHINESE STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY TAKEN
JayWalker_2009@169.51:177.07 THIS GRUELING TEST THE INTENSITY TO LEARN ENGLISH IS ALMOST UNIMAGINABLE UNLESS YOU WITNESS IT
JayWalker_2009@198.24:209.43 SO IS ENGLISH MANIA GOOD OR BAD IS ENGLISH A TSUNAMI WASHING AWAY OTHER LANGUAGES NOT LIKELY ENGLISH IS THE WORLD 'S SECOND LANGUAGE
JayWalker_2009@209.86:222.27 YOUR NATIVE LANGUAGE IS YOUR LIFE BUT WITH ENGLISH YOU CAN BECOME PART OF A WIDER CONVERSATION A GLOBAL CONVERSATION ABOUT GLOBAL PROBLEMS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE OR POVERTY
JayWalker_2009@222.76:231.54 OR HUNGER OR DISEASE THE WORLD HAS OTHER UNIVERSAL LANGUAGES MATHEMATICS IS THE LANGUAGE OF SCIENCE
JayWalker_2009@232.12:244.61 MUSIC IS THE LANGUAGE OF EMOTIONS AND NOW ENGLISH IS BECOMING THE LANGUAGE OF PROBLEM SOLVING NOT BECAUSE AMERICA IS PUSHING IT BUT BECAUSE THE WORLD IS PULLING IT
JayWalker_2009@245.18:255.35 SO ENGLISH MANIA IS A TURNING POINT LIKE THE HARNESSING OF ELECTRICITY IN OUR CITIES OR THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL ENGLISH REPRESENTS HOPE
JayWalker_2009@255.90:257.06 FOR A BETTER FUTURE
JayWalker_2009@257.54:265.24 A FUTURE WHERE THE WORLD HAS A COMMON LANGUAGE TO SOLVE ITS COMMON PROBLEMS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
