JayWalker_2009 OR MANIAS CAN BE DEADLY
JayWalker_2009 THE WORLD HAS A NEW MANIA A MANIA FOR LEARNING ENGLISH LISTEN AS CHINESE STUDENTS PRACTICE THEIR ENGLISH BY SCREAMING IT
JayWalker_2009 HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO LEARN ENGLISH WORLDWIDE TWO BILLION OF THEM
JayWalker_2009 IN LATIN AMERICA IN INDIA IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND MOST OF ALL IN CHINA IF YOU ARE A CHINESE STUDENT YOU START LEARNING ENGLISH IN THE THIRD GRADE
JayWalker_2009 BY LAW THAT'S WHY THIS YEAR CHINA WILL BECOME THE WORLD 'S LARGEST ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRY
JayWalker_2009 WHY ENGLISH IN A SINGLE WORD OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITY FOR A BETTER LIFE A JOB TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR SCHOOL OR PUT BETTER FOOD ON THE TABLE
JayWalker_2009 SHE STUDIES TWELVE HOURS A DAY FOR THREE YEARS TO PREPARE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF HER GRADE
JayWalker_2009 IS BASED ON ENGLISH IT'S CALLED THE GAOKAO AND EIGHTY MILLION HIGH SCHOOL CHINESE STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY TAKEN

JayWalker_2009 YOUR NATIVE LANGUAGE IS YOUR LIFE BUT WITH ENGLISH YOU CAN BECOME PART OF A WIDER CONVERSATION A GLOBAL CONVERSATION ABOUT GLOBAL PROBLEMS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE OR POVERTY
JayWalker_2009 OR HUNGER OR DISEASE THE WORLD HAS OTHER UNIVERSAL LANGUAGES MATHEMATICS IS THE LANGUAGE OF SCIENCE
JayWalker_2009 MUSIC IS THE LANGUAGE OF EMOTIONS AND NOW ENGLISH IS BECOMING THE LANGUAGE OF PROBLEM SOLVING NOT BECAUSE AMERICA IS PUSHING IT BUT BECAUSE THE WORLD IS PULLING IT
JayWalker_2009 SO ENGLISH MANIA IS A TURNING POINT LIKE THE HARNESSING OF ELECTRICITY IN OUR CITIES OR THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL ENGLISH REPRESENTS HOPE
