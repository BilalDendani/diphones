PaolaAntonelli_2007P I DABBLE IN DESIGN I'M A CURATOR OF ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN I HAPPEN TO BE AT THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS REALLY DESIGN
PaolaAntonelli_2007P REALLY GOOD DESIGNERS ARE LIKE SPONGES THEY REALLY ARE CURIOUS AND ABSORB EVERY KIND OF INFORMATION THAT COMES THEIR WAY AND TRANSFORM IT SO THAT IT CAN BE USED BY PEOPLE LIKE US
PaolaAntonelli_2007P AND SO THAT GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE EVERY DESIGN SHOW THAT I CURATE KIND OF LOOKS AT A DIFFERENT WORLD AND IT'S GREAT BECAUSE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME I CHANGE JOBS AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO TODAY IS I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A PREVIEW OF THE NEXT EXHIBITION THAT I'M WORKING ON WHICH IS CALLED DESIGN AND THE ELASTIC MIND
PaolaAntonelli_2007P WORLD THAT I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON THIS PARTICULAR TIME IS THE WORLD OF SCIENCE AND THE WORLD OF TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY ALWAYS COMES INTO PLAY WHEN DESIGN IS INVOLVED
PaolaAntonelli_2007P BUT SCIENCE DOES A LITTLE LESS BUT DESIGNERS ARE GREAT AT TAKING BIG REVOLUTIONS THAT HAPPEN AND TRANSFORMING THEM SO THAT WE CAN USE THEM
PaolaAntonelli_2007P AND THIS IS WHAT THIS EXHIBITION LOOKS AT IF YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR LIFE TODAY YOU GO EVERY DAY THROUGH MANY DIFFERENT SCALES MANY DIFFERENT CHANGES OF RHYTHM AND PACE YOU WORK OVER
PaolaAntonelli_2007P OTHERS ARE A LITTLE SLOWER OTHERS HAVE A LITTLE BIT FEW STRETCH MARKS BUT NONETHELESS THIS IS A QUITE EXCEPTIONAL AUDIENCE FROM THAT VIEWPOINT
PaolaAntonelli_2007P OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOT AS ELASTIC I CAN'T GET MY FATHER IN ITALY TO WORK ON THE INTERNET HE DOESN'T WANT TO PUT HIGH SPEED INTERNET AT HOME AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S SOME LITTLE BIT OF FEAR LITTLE BIT OF RESISTANCE OR JUST CLOGGED MECHANISMS
PaolaAntonelli_2007P SO DESIGNERS WORK ON THIS PARTICULAR MALAISE THAT WE HAVE THESE KIND OF DISCOMFORTS THAT WE HAVE AND TRY TO MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR US
PaolaAntonelli_2007P OF MIND IS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED YOU KNOW WE REALLY NEED WE REALLY CHERISH AND WE REALLY WORK ON AND THIS EXHIBITION IS ABOUT THE WORK OF DESIGNERS THAT HELP US BE MORE ELASTIC AND ALSO
PaolaAntonelli_2007P OF DESIGNERS THAT REALLY WORK ON THIS ELASTICITY AS AN OPPORTUNITY AND ONE LAST THING IS THAT IT'S NOT ONLY DESIGNERS BUT IT'S ALSO SCIENTISTS AND BEFORE I LAUNCH INTO
PaolaAntonelli_2007P YOU CAN SAY THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCIENCE AND DESIGN GOES BACK CENTURIES YOU CAN OF COURSE TALK ABOUT LEONARDO DA VINCI MANY OTHER RENAISSANCE MEN
PaolaAntonelli_2007P AND WOMEN AND THERE'S A GIGANTIC HISTORY BEHIND IT BUT ACCORDING TO A REALLY GREAT SCIENCE HISTORIAN YOU MIGHT KNOW PETER GALISON HE TEACHES AT HARVARD
PaolaAntonelli_2007P WHAT NANOTECHNOLOGY IN PARTICULAR AND QUANTUM PHYSICS HAVE BROUGHT TO DESIGNERS IS THIS RENEWED INTEREST THIS REAL PASSION FOR DESIGN
PaolaAntonelli_2007P SO BASICALLY THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO BUILD THINGS BOTTOM UP ATOM BY ATOM HAS MADE THEM ALL INTO TINKERERS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SCIENTISTS ARE SEEKING DESIGNERS JUST LIKE DESIGNERS ARE SEEKING SCIENTISTS
PaolaAntonelli_2007P IT'S A BRAND NEW LOVE AFFAIR THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CULTIVATE AT MOMA TOGETHER WITH ADAM BLY WHO IS THE FOUNDER OF SEED MAGAZINE THAT'S NOW A MULTIMEDIA COMPANY YOU MIGHT KNOW IT WE FOUNDED ABOUT A YEAR AGO
PaolaAntonelli_2007P AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY REALLY STARTED TALKING EACH OTHERS LANGUAGE AND NOW WE'RE ALREADY AT THE POINT THAT THEY COLLABORATE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P PAUL STEINHARDT A PHYSICIST FROM NEW YORK AND ARANDA LASCH ARCHITECTS COLLABORATED IN AN INSTALLATION IN LONDON AT THE SERPENTINE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P AND IT'S REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THIS HAPPENS THE EXHIBITION WILL TALK ABOUT THE WORK OF BOTH DESIGNERS AND SCIENTISTS AND SHOW HOW THEY'RE PRESENTING THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE FUTURE TO US
PaolaAntonelli_2007P AND YOU KNOW I'M SHOWING TO YOU DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE SHOW RIGHT NOW JUST TO GIVE YOU A TASTE OF IT BUT NANOPHYSICS AND NANOTECHNOLOGY FOR INSTANCE HAS
PaolaAntonelli_2007P REALLY OPENED THE DESIGNER 'S MIND IN THIS CASE I'M SHOWING MORE THE DESIGNERS WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE REALLY BEEN STIMULATED A LOT OF THE OBJECTS IN THE SHOW ARE CONCEPTS NOT
PaolaAntonelli_2007P REALLY OBJECTS THAT EXIST ALREADY BUT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS THE WORK OF SOME SCIENTISTS FROM UCLA THIS KIND OF ALPHABET SOUP
PaolaAntonelli_2007P IS A NEW WAY TO MARK PROTEINS NOT ONLY BY COLOR BUT LITERALLY BY ALPHABET LETTERS SO THEY CONSTRUCT IT AND THEY CAN CONSTRUCT ALL KINDS OF FORMS AT THE NANOSCALE AND THIS IS THE WORK INSTEAD
PaolaAntonelli_2007P NEW SENSING ELEMENTS ON THE BODY YOU CAN GROW HAIRS ON YOUR NAILS AND THEREFORE GRAB SOME OF THE PARTICLES FROM ANOTHER PERSON THEY SEEM VERY VERY OBSESSED
PaolaAntonelli_2007P WITH FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT THE IDEAL MATE SO THEY'RE WORKING ON ENHANCING EVERYTHING TOUCH SMELL EVERYTHING THEY CAN IN ORDER TO FIND THE PERFECT MATE VERY INTERESTING
PaolaAntonelli_2007P AND THIS INSTEAD IS A TYPEFACE DESIGNER FROM ISRAEL WHO HAS DESIGNED HE CALLS THEM TYPOSPERMA HE 'S THINKING OF COURSE IT'S ALL A CONCEPT
PaolaAntonelli_2007P INJECTING TYPEFACES INTO SPERMS AND INTO SPERMATOZOA I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY IT IN ENGLISH SPERMATAZOI IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM BECOME TO ALMOST HAVE A SONG OR A WHOLE POEM WRITTEN WITH EVERY EJACULATION
PaolaAntonelli_2007P I TELL YOU DESIGNERS ARE QUITE FANTASTIC YOU KNOW SO TISSUE DESIGN IN THIS CASE TOO YOU HAVE A MIXTURE OF SCIENTISTS AND DESIGNERS THIS HERE IS PART OF THE SAME LAB
PaolaAntonelli_2007P REALLY UGLY PATTY AND SO THE ASSIGNMENTS TO THE STUDENTS WAS HOW SHOULD THE STEAK OF TOMORROW BE WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO KILL COWS AND IT CAN HAVE ANY SHAPE WHAT SHOULD IT BE LIKE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P SO THIS PARTICULAR STUDENT JAMES KING WENT AROUND THE BEAUTIFUL ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE PICKED THE BEST BEST COW THAT HE COULD SEE AND THEN PUT HER IN THE MRI MACHINE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P AND THEN TOOK THE SCANS OF THE BEST ORGANS AND MADE THE MEAT OF COURSE THIS IS DONE WITH A JAPANESE RESIN FOOD MAKERS BUT YOU KNOW IN THE FUTURE IT COULD BE MADE BETTER BUT THAT REPRODUCES THE BEST MRI SCAN OF THE BEST COW HE COULD FIND
PaolaAntonelli_2007P AND INSTEAD THIS ELEMENT HERE IS MUCH MORE BANAL SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW CAN BE DONE ALREADY IS TO GROW BONE TISSUE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE A WEDDING RING OUT OF THE BONE TISSUE OF YOUR LOVED ONE LITERALLY SO THIS IS INDEED MADE OF HUMAN BONE TISSUE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P THIS IS SYMBIOTICA AND YOU KNOW THEY'VE BEEN WORKING THEY WERE THE FIRST ONES TO DO THIS IN VITRO MEAT AND NOW THEY'VE ALSO DONE AN IN VITRO COAT A LEATHER COAT IT'S MINISCULE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P BUT IT'S A REAL COAT IT'S SHAPED LIKE ONE SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO REALLY NOT HAVE ANY EXCUSE TO BE WEARING EVERYTHING LEATHER IN THE FUTURE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
PaolaAntonelli_2007P TOPICS OF THE SHOW YOU KNOW AS ANYTHING IN OUR LIFE TODAY WE CAN LOOK AT IT FROM MANY MANY DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS AND AT DIFFERENT LEVELS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND MOST IMPORTANT CONCEPTS IS THE IDEA OF SCALE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P WE CHANGE SCALE VERY OFTEN WE CHANGE RESOLUTION OF SCREENS AND WE DON'T WE'RE NOT REALLY FAZED BY IT WE DO IT VERY COMFORTABLY
PaolaAntonelli_2007P SO YOU GO EVEN IN THE EXHIBITION FROM THE IDEA OF NANOTECHNOLOGY AND THE NANOSCALE TO INSTEAD THE MANIPULATION OF REALLY GREAT AMOUNTS OF DATA THE MAPPING AND TAGGING OF THE UNIVERSE AND OF THE WORLD
PaolaAntonelli_2007P AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE A SECTION WILL BE DEVOTED TO INFORMATION DESIGN AND YOU SEE HERE THE WORK OF BEN FRY THIS IS HUMAN VERSUS CHIMPS THE FEW CHROMOSOMES THAT DISTINGUISH US FROM CHIMPS IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL VISUALIZATION THAT HE DID FOR SEED MAGAZINE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P AND HERE 'S THE WHOLE CODE OF PAC MAN VISUALIZED WITH ALL THE GO TO GO BACK TO ALSO MADE INTO A BEAUTIFUL CHOREOGRAPHY
PaolaAntonelli_2007P AND THEN ALSO GRAPHS BY SCIENTISTS THIS BEAUTIFUL DIAGRAPH OF PROTEIN HOMOLOGY SCIENTISTS ARE STARTING TO ALSO CONSIDER AESTHETICS WE WERE DISCUSSING WITH KEITH SHRUBB THIS MORNING
PaolaAntonelli_2007P THE FACT THAT MANY SCIENTISTS TEND NOT TO USE ANYTHING BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR PRESENTATIONS OTHERWISE THEY'RE AFRAID OF BEING CONSIDERED DUMB BLONDES SO THEY PICK THE WORST BACKGROUND FROM
PaolaAntonelli_2007P ANY KIND OF POWERPOINT PRESENTATION THE WORST TYPEFACE IT'S ONLY RECENTLY THAT THIS KIND OF MARRIAGE BETWEEN DESIGN AND SCIENCE IS PRODUCING SOME OF THE FIRST
PaolaAntonelli_2007P IF WE CAN SAY SO SCIENTIFIC PRESENTATIONS ANOTHER ASPECT OF CONTEMPORARY DESIGN THAT I THINK IS MIND OPENING PROMISING AND WILL REALLY BE THE FUTURE OF DESIGN WHICH IS THE IDEA OF COLLECTIVE DESIGN YOU KNOW THE WHOLE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P LAPTOP FROM ONE LAPTOP PER CHILD IS BASED ON THE IDEA OF COLLABORATION AND MASH AND NETWORKING SO THE MORE THE MERRIER THE MORE COMPUTERS THE STRONGER THE SIGNAL AND CHILDREN
PaolaAntonelli_2007P WORK ON THE INTERFACE SO THAT IT'S ALL BASED ON DOING THINGS TOGETHER TASKS TOGETHER SO THE IDEA OF COLLECTIVE DESIGN IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BECOME EVEN BIGGER IN THE FUTURE AND THIS IS CHOSEN AS AN EXAMPLE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P A TERM THAT I COINED A FEW YEARS AGO WHILE I WAS THINKING OF HOW PRESSED WE ARE TOGETHER AND AT THE SAME TIME HOW THESE SMALL OBJECTS LIKE THE WALKMAN FIRST AND THEN THE IPOD
PaolaAntonelli_2007P AND YOU CAN BE COMPLETELY ISOLATED AND HAVE YOUR OWN ROOM IN YOUR IPOD AND THIS IS THE WORK OF SEVERAL DESIGNERS THAT REALLY
PaolaAntonelli_2007P AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL POOL WITH THIS PERFECT TEMPERATURE AND YOU CAN HAVE THIS ISOLATION TANK PHONE CONVERSATION WITH WHOMEVER YOU'VE BEEN WANTING TO TALK WITH FOR A LONG TIME
PaolaAntonelli_2007P AND SAME THING HERE SOCIAL TELE PRESENCE IT'S ACTUALLY ALREADY USED BY THE MILITARY A LITTLE BIT BUT IT'S THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO BE SOMEWHERE ELSE WITH YOUR SENSES WHILE YOU'RE REMOVED FROM IT PHYSICALLY AND THIS IS CALLED BLIND DATE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P IT'S A SO IF YOU'RE TOO SHY TO BE REALLY AT THE DATE SO YOU STAY AT A DISTANCE WITH YOUR FLOWERS AND SOMEBODY ELSE REENACTS THE DATE FOR YOU RAPID MANUFACTURING IS ANOTHER BIG AREA IN WHICH TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN
PaolaAntonelli_2007P I THINK I THINK BOUND TO CHANGE THE WORLD YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT IT BEFORE MANY TIMES RAPID MANUFACTURING IS A COMPUTER FILE SENT DIRECTLY FROM THE COMPUTER TO THE MANUFACTURING MACHINE IT USED TO BE CALLED
PaolaAntonelli_2007P THE MATERIALS BECAME BETTER BETTER RESINS TECHNIQUES BECAME BETTER NOT ONLY CARVING BUT ALSO STEREOLITHOGRAPHY AND LASER
PaolaAntonelli_2007P IT TAKES SEVEN DAYS TODAY TO MANUFACTURE A CHAIR BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ONE DAY IT WILL TAKE SEVEN HOURS AND THEN THE DREAM IS THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FROM HOME CUSTOMIZE YOUR CHAIR YOU KNOW COMPANIES AND DESIGNERS WILL
PaolaAntonelli_2007P BE DESIGNING THE MATRIX OR THE MARGINS THAT RESPECT BOTH SOLIDITY AND BRAND AND DESIGN IDENTITY AND THEN YOU CAN SEND IT TO THE KINKO 'S STORE AT THE CORNER AND GO GET YOUR CHAIR
PaolaAntonelli_2007P NOW THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS ARE ENORMOUS NOT ONLY REGARDING THE PARTICIPATION OF THE FINAL BUYER IN THE DESIGN PROCESS BUT ALSO NO TRACKING NO WAREHOUSING NO
PaolaAntonelli_2007P A PICTURE THAT WAS IN WIRED MAGAZINE YOU KNOW THE ARTIFACTS OF THE FUTURE SECTION THAT I LOVE SO MUCH THAT SHOWS YOU CAN HAVE YOUR DESKTOP THREE D PRINTER AND PRINT YOUR OWN BASKETBALL
PaolaAntonelli_2007P BUT HERE INSTEAD ARE EXAMPLES YOU CAN ALREADY THREE D PRINT TEXTILES WHICH IS VERY INTERESTING THIS IS JUST A REALLY NICE TOUCH IT'S CALLED SLOW
PaolaAntonelli_2007P WHAT WE DO IN ORDER TO THEN RETRACE OUR PATH ALSO WE DO IT IN ORDER TO SHARE WITH OTHER PEOPLE AGAIN THIS COMMUNAL SENSE OF EXPERIENCE THAT SEEMS TO BE SO IMPORTANT TODAY
PaolaAntonelli_2007P SO VARIOUS WAYS TO MAP AND TAG ARE ALSO THE WORK OF MANY DESIGNERS NOWADAYS THE SENSES DESIGNERS AND SCIENTISTS ALL WORK ON
PaolaAntonelli_2007P TRYING TO EXPAND OUR SENSES CAPABILITIES SO THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE MORE AND ALSO ANIMAL SENSES IN A WAY
PaolaAntonelli_2007P THIS PARTICULAR OBJECT THAT MANY PEOPLE LOVE SO MUCH IS ACTUALLY BASED ON KIND OF A SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT THE FACT THAT BEES HAVE A VERY STRONG OLFACTORY SENSE AND SO MUCH LIKE DOGS THAT CAN SMELL CERTAIN KINDS OF SKIN CANCER
PaolaAntonelli_2007P ALSO BEES CAN BE TRAINED BY PAVLOVIAN REFLEX TO DETECT ONE TYPE OF CANCER AND ALSO PREGNANCY AND SO THIS STUDENT AT THE RCA DESIGNED THIS BEAUTIFUL BLOWN GLASS OBJECT WHERE THE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P MOVE FROM ONE CHAMBER TO THE OTHER IF THEY DETECT THAT PARTICULAR SMELL THAT SIGNIFIES IN THIS CASE PREGNANCY ANOTHER SHAPE IS MADE FOR CANCER DESIGN FOR DEBATE IS A VERY INTERESTING NEW ENDEAVOR THAT DESIGNERS HAVE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P REALLY SHAPED FOR THEMSELVES SOME DESIGNERS DON'T DESIGN OBJECTS PRODUCTS THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY USE BUT RATHER THEY DESIGN SCENARIOS THAT ARE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P THIS IS QUITE BEAUTIFUL IT'S DUNNE AND RABY ALL THE ROBOTS THOSE ARE A SERIES OF ROBOTS THAT ARE MEANT TO BE TAKEN CARE OF
PaolaAntonelli_2007P WE ALWAYS THINK THAT ROBOTS WILL TAKE CARE OF US AND INSTEAD THEY DESIGNED THESE ROBOTS THAT ARE VERY VERY NEEDY YOU NEED TO TAKE ONE IN YOUR ARMS AND LOOK AT IT IN THE EYES FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE IT DOES SOMETHING
PaolaAntonelli_2007P ANOTHER ONE GETS REALLY REALLY NERVOUS IF YOU GET IN TO THE ROOM AND STARTS SHAKING SO YOU HAVE TO CALM IT DOWN SO IT'S REALLY A WAY TO MAKE US THINK MORE ABOUT WHAT ROBOTS MEAN TO US
PaolaAntonelli_2007P AND ACCESSORIES FOR LONELY MEN THE IDEA IS THAT WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR LOVED ONE OR YOU GO THROUGH A BAD BREAKUP WHAT YOU MISS THE MOST ARE THOSE ANNOYING THINGS
PaolaAntonelli_2007P TO HATE WHEN YOU WERE WITH THE OTHER PERSON SO HE DESIGNED ALL THESE SERIES OF ACCESSORIES LIKE THIS ONE IS SOMETHING THAT TAKES AWAY THE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P FROM YOU AT NIGHT THEN THERE'S ANOTHER ONE THAT BREATHES ON YOUR NECK THERE'S ANOTHER ONE THAT THROWS PLATES AND BREAKS THEM SO IT'S JUST THIS IDEA OF WHAT WE REALLY MISS IN LIFE ELIO CACCAVALE INSTEAD HE TOOK THE IDEA OF
PaolaAntonelli_2007P THOSE DOLLS THAT EXPLAIN LEUKEMIA HE 'S WORKING ON DOLLS THAT EXPLAIN SENO TRANSPLANTATION AND ALSO THE SPIDER
PaolaAntonelli_2007P THE FLOWERS AND THE BEES AND THEN THERE'S THE BABY NO IT CAN BE TWO MOMS THREE DADS IN VITRO THERE'S THE WHOLE IDEA OF HOW BABIES CAN BE MADE TODAY THAT HAS CHANGED SO IT'S A SERIES OF DOLLS THAT HE 'S WORKING ON
PaolaAntonelli_2007P ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS IS THAT DESIGNERS DON'T REALLY WORK ON LIFE EVEN THOUGH THEY TAKE TECHNOLOGY INTO ACCOUNT AND MANY DESIGNERS HAVE BEEN WORKING RECENTLY ON THE IDEA OF DEATH AND
PaolaAntonelli_2007P AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT TODAY WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR HOW WE SHOULD BEHAVE ABOUT IT WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES THESE THREE OBJECTS OVER THERE
PaolaAntonelli_2007P ARE HARD DRIVES ON WITH A BLUETOOTH CONNECTION BUT THEY'RE IN REALITY VERY VERY BEAUTIFUL SCULPTED ARTIFACTS THAT
PaolaAntonelli_2007P HAVE YOU KNOW GERTRUDE 'S WHOLE LIFE AND ALL OF HER FILES AND HER ADDRESS BOOK COME ALIVE AND THIS IS EVEN BETTER THIS IS AUGER LOIZEAU AFTERLIFE IT'S THE IDEA THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE IN AN AFTERLIFE SO TO GIVE THEM SOMETHING TANGIBLE THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING AFTER DEATH
PaolaAntonelli_2007P THEY TAKE THE GASTRIC JUICES OF PEOPLE WHO PASSED AWAY AND CONCENTRATE THEM AND PUT THEM INTO A BATTERY THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE USED TO POWER FLASHLIGHTS THEY ALSO
PaolaAntonelli_2007P YOU KNOW SEX TOYS WHATEVER IT'S QUITE AMAZING
PaolaAntonelli_2007P HOW THESE THINGS CAN MAKE YOU SMILE CAN MAKE YOU LAUGH CAN MAKE YOU CRY SOMETIMES BUT I'M HOPING THAT THIS PARTICULAR EXHIBITION WILL BE ABLE TO
