AndrewBird_2010 THE
AndrewBird_2010 SO I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING SPECIAL
AndrewBird_2010 SO THIS IS BASICALLY A SONG ABOUT LOOPS BUT NOT THE KIND OF LOOPS THAT I MAKE UP HERE THEY 'RE FEEDBACK LOOPS AND IN THE AUDIO WORLD THAT 'S WHEN THE MICROPHONE GETS TOO CLOSE TO
AndrewBird_2010 ITS SOUND SOURCE AND THEN IT GETS IN THIS SELF DESTRUCTIVE LOOP THAT CREATES A VERY UNPLEASANT SOUND AND I 'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU
AndrewBird_2010 COWS THEIR OWN BRAINS OR YOU GET MAD COW DISEASE AND INBREEDING AND INCEST AND
AndrewBird_2010 AND IT 'S LIKE YOUR EYES START STRAINING TO SEE THEMSELVES
AndrewBird_2010 IT 'S IMPOSSIBLE OF COURSE FOR YOUR EYES TO SEE THEMSELVES BUT THEY SEEM TO BE TRYING SO THAT 'S GETTING A LITTLE MORE CLOSER TO A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OR EARS BEING ABLE TO HEAR THEMSELVES IT 'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE THAT 'S THE THING SO
AndrewBird_2010 IT 'S KIND OF COOL SONGWRITERS CAN SORT OF GET AWAY WITH MURDER YOU CAN THROW OUT CRAZY THEORIES AND NOT HAVE TO BACK IT UP WITH DATA OR GRAPHS OR RESEARCH
AndrewBird_2010 I 'M GOING TO FINISH UP WITH A SONG OF MINE CALLED WEATHER SYSTEMS
