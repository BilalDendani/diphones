DannyHillis_2013 THERE 'S ACTUALLY ONLY ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE ON EACH PAGE
DannyHillis_2013 BECAUSE WE HAVE THE NAME ADDRESS AND TELEPHONE NUMBER OF EVERY SINGLE PERSON
DannyHillis_2013 AND IN FACT EVERYBODY 'S LISTED TWICE BECAUSE IT 'S SORTED ONCE BY NAME AND ONCE BY EMAIL ADDRESS
DannyHillis_2013 OBVIOUSLY A VERY SMALL COMMUNITY THERE WERE ONLY TWO OTHER DANNYS ON THE INTERNET THEN I KNEW THEM BOTH
DannyHillis_2013 WE COULD DEPEND ON EACH OTHER TO DO THINGS SO JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE LEVEL OF TRUST IN THIS COMMUNITY LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO
DannyHillis_2013 REGISTER A DOMAIN NAME IN THE EARLY DAYS NOW IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT I GOT TO REGISTER THE THIRD DOMAIN NAME ON THE INTERNET
DannyHillis_2013 BUT THEN I THOUGHT YOU KNOW THERE 'S A LOT OF REALLY INTERESTING NAMES OUT THERE MAYBE I SHOULD REGISTER A FEW EXTRAS JUST IN CASE AND THEN I THOUGHT NAH THAT WOULDN 'T BE VERY NICE
DannyHillis_2013 WERE FUNDAMENTALLY FROM EACH ACCORDING
DannyHillis_2013 TO THEIR ABILITY TO EACH ACCORDING TO THEIR NEED
DannyHillis_2013 AND SO IF YOU HAD SOME EXTRA BANDWIDTH YOU 'D DELIVER A MESSAGE FOR SOMEONE IF THEY HAD SOME EXTRA BANDWIDTH THEY WOULD DELIVER A MESSAGE FOR YOU YOU 'D KIND OF DEPEND ON PEOPLE TO DO THAT AND THAT WAS
DannyHillis_2013 IT OBVIOUSLY WORKED REALLY WELL AND WE ALL SAW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE INTERNET IT WAS INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL
DannyHillis_2013 MY ROUGH CALCULATION IS IT WOULD BE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILES
DannyHillis_2013 PUBLISHED TO EVERYONE SO THE FACT IS THAT THERE 'S A LOT OF BAD GUYS ON THE INTERNET THESE DAYS
DannyHillis_2013 AND SO WE DEALT WITH THAT BY MAKING
DannyHillis_2013 BECAUSE PAKISTAN MADE SOME MISTAKES IN HOW IT WAS CENSORING YOUTUBE IN ITS INTERNAL NETWORK THEY DIDN 'T INTEND TO SCREW UP ASIA
DannyHillis_2013 BUT THEY DID BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THE PROTOCOLS WORK
DannyHillis_2013 ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED MANY OF YOU IN THIS AUDIENCE IS YOU MAY REMEMBER A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO ALL THE PLANES WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI WERE GROUNDED
DannyHillis_2013 BECAUSE A SINGLE ROUTING CARD IN SALT LAKE CITY
DannyHillis_2013 BUT THE FACT IS THAT PEOPLE COULDN 'T TAKE OFF BECAUSE SOMETHING WAS GOING WRONG ON THE INTERNET AND THE ROUTER CARD WAS DOWN AND SO THERE ARE MANY OF THOSE THINGS THAT START TO HAPPEN NOW THERE WAS AN INTERESTING THING THAT HAPPENED LAST APRIL ALL OF A SUDDEN
DannyHillis_2013 A LOT OF THE TRAFFIC BETWEEN U S MILITARY INSTALLATIONS STARTED GETTING RE ROUTED THROUGH CHINA
DannyHillis_2013 SO FOR A FEW HOURS IT ALL PASSED THROUGH CHINA NOW CHINA TELECOM SAYS IT WAS JUST AN HONEST MISTAKE
DannyHillis_2013 IMAGINE HOW VULNERABLE THE SYSTEM IS TO
DannyHillis_2013 DELIBERATE ATTACKS
DannyHillis_2013 SO IF SOMEBODY REALLY WANTED TO ATTACK THE UNITED STATES OR WESTERN CIVILIZATION THESE DAYS THEY 'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT WITH TANKS
DannyHillis_2013 IT DIDN 'T THINK OF ITSELF AS BEING ON THE INTERNET IT THOUGHT OF ITSELF AS BEING DISCONNECTED FROM THE INTERNET BUT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR SOMEBODY TO SMUGGLE A USB DRIVE IN THERE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SOFTWARE GOT IN THERE THAT CAUSES THE CENTRIFUGES IN THAT CASE TO ACTUALLY DESTROY THEMSELVES
DannyHillis_2013 NOW THAT SAME KIND OF SOFTWARE COULD DESTROY AN OIL REFINERY OR A PHARMACEUTICAL FACTORY OR A SEMICONDUCTOR PLANT
DannyHillis_2013 AND SO THERE 'S A LOT OF I 'M SURE YOU 'VE READ A LOT IN PAPERS ABOUT WORRIES ABOUT CYBER ATTACKS AND DEFENSES AGAINST THOSE
DannyHillis_2013 BUT THE FACT IS PEOPLE ARE MOSTLY FOCUSED ON DEFENDING THE COMPUTERS ON THE INTERNET AND THERE 'S BEEN SURPRISINGLY LITTLE ATTENTION TO DEFENDING THE INTERNET ITSELF AS A COMMUNICATIONS MEDIUM
DannyHillis_2013 THERE WERE ACTUALLY TIMES THERE WAS A PARTICULAR TIME IT FAILED COMPLETELY
DannyHillis_2013 BECAUSE ONE SINGLE MESSAGE PROCESSOR ACTUALLY GOT A BUG IN IT
DannyHillis_2013 BECAUSE OF A BROKEN CARD DECIDED IT COULD ACTUALLY GET A MESSAGE TO SOME PLACE IN NEGATIVE TIME
DannyHillis_2013 SO IN OTHER WORDS IT CLAIMED IT COULD DELIVER A MESSAGE BEFORE YOU SENT IT
DannyHillis_2013 THE INTERESTING THING WAS THOUGH THAT THE SYSADMINS WERE ABLE TO FIX IT BUT
DannyHillis_2013 THEY HAD TO BASICALLY TURN EVERY SINGLE THING ON THE INTERNET OFF
DannyHillis_2013 FOR MORE AND MORE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE
DannyHillis_2013 WHEN YOU TAKE OFF FROM LAX YOU 'RE REALLY NOT THINKING YOU 'RE USING THE INTERNET WHEN YOU PUMP GAS YOU REALLY DON 'T THINK YOU 'RE USING THE INTERNET WHAT 'S HAPPENING INCREASINGLY THOUGH IS THESE SYSTEMS ARE BEGINNING TO USE THE INTERNET MOST OF THEM AREN 'T BASED ON THE INTERNET YET BUT THEY 'RE STARTING TO USE THE INTERNET FOR SERVICE FUNCTIONS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS
DannyHillis_2013 AND SO IF YOU TAKE SOMETHING LIKE THE CELL PHONE SYSTEM WHICH IS STILL RELATIVELY INDEPENDENT OF THE INTERNET
DannyHillis_2013 FOR THE MOST PART INTERNET PIECES ARE BEGINNING TO SNEAK INTO IT
DannyHillis_2013 IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE CONTROL
DannyHillis_2013 AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS AND IT 'S SO TEMPTING TO USE THESE SAME BUILDING BLOCKS BECAUSE THEY WORK SO WELL THEY 'RE CHEAP THEY 'RE REPEATED AND SO ON SO ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS MORE AND MORE
DannyHillis_2013 AND IN FACT NOBODY REALLY EXACTLY UNDERSTANDS ALL THE THINGS IT 'S BEING USED FOR RIGHT NOW IT 'S TURNING INTO ONE OF THESE BIG EMERGENT SYSTEMS LIKE THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM WHERE WE 'VE DESIGNED ALL THE PARTS BUT NOBODY REALLY EXACTLY UNDERSTANDS
DannyHillis_2013 HOW IT OPERATES AND ALL THE LITTLE DETAILS OF IT AND WHAT KINDS OF EMERGENT BEHAVIORS IT CAN HAVE
DannyHillis_2013 TREAT THE COMMENTS OF AN ECONOMIST ABOUT THE ECONOMY OR A WEATHERMAN ABOUT THE WEATHER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY HAVE AN INFORMED OPINION BUT IT 'S CHANGING SO QUICKLY THAT EVEN THE EXPERTS DON 'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT 'S GOING ON
DannyHillis_2013 SO IF YOU SEE ONE OF THESE MAPS OF THE INTERNET IT 'S JUST SOMEBODY 'S GUESS NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT THE INTERNET IS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT 'S DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS AN HOUR AGO IT 'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING IT 'S CONSTANTLY RECONFIGURING
DannyHillis_2013 AND THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS I THINK WE ARE
DannyHillis_2013 AND SO RIGHT NOW I THINK IT 'S LITERALLY TRUE
DannyHillis_2013 THAT WE DON 'T KNOW WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN EFFECTIVE DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK
DannyHillis_2013 ON THE INTERNET WOULD BE AND WHATEVER IT WOULD BE IS GOING TO BE WORSE NEXT YEAR AND WORSE NEXT YEAR AND SO ON BUT SO WHAT WE NEED IS A PLAN B THERE IS NO PLAN B RIGHT NOW THERE 'S NO CLEAR BACKUP SYSTEM THAT WE 'VE VERY CAREFULLY KEPT TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE INTERNET MADE OUT OF COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SETS OF
DannyHillis_2013 BUILDING BLOCKS SO WHAT WE NEED IS SOMETHING THAT DOESN 'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO HAVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INTERNET BUT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS TO BE ABLE TO CALL UP THE FIRE DEPARTMENT EVEN WITHOUT THE INTERNET OR THE HOSPITALS HAVE TO ORDER FUEL OIL THIS DOESN 'T NEED TO BE A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR GOVERNMENT PROJECT
DannyHillis_2013 IT 'S ACTUALLY RELATIVELY SIMPLE TO DO TECHNICALLY BECAUSE IT CAN USE EXISTING FIBERS THAT ARE IN THE GROUND EXISTING WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE IT 'S BASICALLY A MATTER OF DECIDING TO DO IT
DannyHillis_2013 WE COULD GET FOCUSED ON JUST WANTING THIS OTHER SYSTEM TO EXIST
DannyHillis_2013 AND I THINK IF ENOUGH PEOPLE SAY YEAH I WOULD LIKE TO USE IT I 'D LIKE TO HAVE SUCH A SYSTEM THEN IT WILL GET BUILT IT 'S NOT THAT HARD A PROBLEM IT COULD DEFINITELY BE DONE BY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM
