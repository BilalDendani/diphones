RichardWeller_2012X@27.07:40.53 WHAT YOU LEARN WHEN YOU GO TO AUSTRALIA IS THE AUSTRALIANS ARE VERY COMPETITIVE AND THEY ARE NOT MAGNANIMOUS IN VICTORY AND THAT HAPPENED A LOT YOU POMMIES YOU CAN 'T PLAY CRICKET RUGBY I COULD ACCEPT THAT
RichardWeller_2012X@40.53:51.19 BUT MOVING INTO WORK AND WE HAVE EACH WEEK WHAT 'S CALLED A JOURNAL CLUB WHEN YOU 'D SIT DOWN WITH THE OTHER DOCTORS AND YOU 'D STUDY A SCIENTIFIC PAPER IN RELATION TO MEDICINE
RichardWeller_2012X@51.19:59.55 AND AFTER WEEK ONE IT WAS ABOUT CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY A DRY SUBJECT HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE OF HEART DISEASE WHAT THE RATES ARE
RichardWeller_2012X@59.55:64.79 AND THEY WERE COMPETITIVE ABOUT THIS YOU POMMIES YOUR RATES OF HEART DISEASE ARE SHOCKING
RichardWeller_2012X@64.79:84.15 AND OF COURSE THEY WERE RIGHT AUSTRALIANS HAVE ABOUT A THIRD LESS HEART DISEASE THAN WE DO LESS DEATHS FROM HEART ATTACKS HEART FAILURE LESS STROKES THEY 'RE GENERALLY A HEALTHIER BUNCH AND OF COURSE THEY SAID THIS WAS BECAUSE OF THEIR FINE MORAL STANDING THEIR EXERCISE BECAUSE THEY 'RE AUSTRALIANS AND WE 'RE WEEDY POMMIES AND SO ON
RichardWeller_2012X@84.15:96.67 BUT IT 'S NOT JUST AUSTRALIA THAT HAS BETTER HEALTH THAN BRITAIN WITHIN BRITAIN THERE IS A GRADIENT OF HEALTH AND THIS IS WHAT 'S CALLED STANDARDIZED MORTALITY BASICALLY YOUR CHANCES OF DYING
RichardWeller_2012X@96.67:101.43 THIS IS LOOKING AT DATA FROM THE PAPER ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO BUT IT 'S TRUE TODAY
RichardWeller_2012X@131.31:147.97 BUT THIS GRAPH IS AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THESE KNOWN RISK FACTORS THIS IS AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR SMOKING SOCIAL CLASS DIET ALL THOSE OTHER KNOWN RISK FACTORS WE ARE LEFT WITH THIS MISSING SPACE OF INCREASED DEATHS THE FURTHER NORTH YOU GO
RichardWeller_2012X@147.97:159.2 NOW SUNLIGHT OF COURSE COMES INTO THIS AND VITAMIN D HAS HAD A GREAT DEAL OF PRESS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE GET CONCERNED ABOUT IT AND WE NEED VITAMIN D IT 'S NOW A REQUIREMENT THAT CHILDREN HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT
RichardWeller_2012X@159.2:177.26 MY GRANDMOTHER GREW UP IN GLASGOW BACK IN THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY S AND THIRTY S WHEN RICKETS WAS A REAL PROBLEM AND COD LIVER OIL WAS BROUGHT IN AND THAT REALLY PREVENTED THE RICKETS THAT USED TO BE COMMON IN THIS CITY AND I AS A CHILD WAS FED COD LIVER OIL BY MY GRANDMOTHER I DISTINCTLY NOBODY FORGETS COD LIVER OIL
RichardWeller_2012X@177.34:192.1 BUT AN ASSOCIATION THE HIGHER PEOPLE 'S BLOOD LEVELS OF VITAMIN D ARE THE LESS HEART DISEASE THEY HAVE THE LESS CANCER THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF DATA SUGGESTING THAT VITAMIN D IS VERY GOOD FOR YOU AND IT IS TO PREVENT RICKETS AND SO ON
RichardWeller_2012X@192.1:201.96 BUT IF YOU GIVE PEOPLE VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTS YOU DON 'T CHANGE THAT HIGH RATE OF HEART DISEASE AND THE EVIDENCE FOR IT PREVENTING CANCERS IS NOT YET GREAT
RichardWeller_2012X@201.96:220.03 SO WHAT I 'M GOING TO SUGGEST IS THAT VITAMIN D IS NOT THE ONLY STORY IN TOWN IT 'S NOT THE ONLY REASON PREVENTING HEART DISEASE HIGH VITAMIN D LEVELS I THINK ARE A MARKER FOR SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE AND SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE IN METHODS I 'M GOING TO SHOW IS GOOD FOR HEART DISEASE
RichardWeller_2012X@220.03:226.24 ANYWAY I CAME BACK FROM AUSTRALIA AND DESPITE THE OBVIOUS RISKS TO MY HEALTH I MOVED TO ABERDEEN
RichardWeller_2012X@256.93:273.02 AND WHAT WAS REMARKABLE ABOUT IT WAS IN THE PAST WHEN WE THINK OF CHEMICAL MESSENGERS WITHIN THE BODY WE THOUGHT OF COMPLICATED THINGS LIKE ESTROGEN AND INSULIN OR NERVE TRANSMISSION VERY COMPLEX PROCESSES WITH VERY COMPLEX CHEMICALS THAT FIT INTO VERY COMPLEX RECEPTORS
RichardWeller_2012X@273.02:278.98 AND HERE 'S THIS INCREDIBLY SIMPLE MOLECULE A NITROGEN AND AN OXYGEN THAT ARE STUCK TOGETHER
RichardWeller_2012X@278.98:286.28 AND YET THESE ARE HUGELY IMPORTANT FOR UNCLEAR OUR LOW BLOOD PRESSURE FOR NEUROTRANSMISSION FOR MANY MANY THINGS
RichardWeller_2012X@286.28:288.71 BUT PARTICULARLY CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH
RichardWeller_2012X@288.71:292.86 AND I STARTED DOING RESEARCH AND WE FOUND VERY EXCITINGLY
RichardWeller_2012X@302.25:313.54 I THOUGHT WELL WHAT 'S IT DOING HOW DO YOU HAVE LOW BLOOD PRESSURE IN YOUR SKIN IT 'S NOT THE HEART WHAT DO YOU DO SO I WENT OFF TO THE STATES AS MANY PEOPLE DO IF THEY 'RE GOING TO DO RESEARCH AND I SPENT A FEW YEARS IN PITTSBURGH
RichardWeller_2012X@313.54:331.65 THIS IS PITTSBURGH AND I WAS INTERESTED IN THESE REALLY COMPLEX SYSTEMS WE THOUGHT THAT MAYBE NITRIC OXIDE AFFECTED CELL DEATH AND HOW CELLS SURVIVE AND THEIR RESISTANCE TO OTHER THINGS AND I FIRST OFF STARTED WORK IN CELL CULTURE GROWING CELLS AND THEN I WAS USING KNOCKOUT MOUSE MODELS MICE THAT COULDN 'T MAKE THE GENE
RichardWeller_2012X@331.65:336.7 WE WORKED OUT A MECHANISM WHICH NO WAS HELPING CELLS SURVIVE
RichardWeller_2012X@356.15:364.29 AN IDEAL MODEL BUT WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT WE COULDN 'T REPRODUCE IN MAN THE DATA WE HAD SHOWN IN MICE
RichardWeller_2012X@364.29:381.36 IT SEEMED WE COULDN 'T TURN OFF THE PRODUCTION OF NITRIC OXIDE IN THE SKIN OF HUMANS WE PUT ON CREAMS THAT BLOCKED THE ENZYME THAT MADE IT WE INJECTED THINGS WE COULDN 'T TURN OFF THE NITRIC OXIDE AND THE REASON FOR THIS IT TURNED OUT AFTER TWO OR THREE YEARS WORK
RichardWeller_2012X@381.36:391.67 WAS THAT IN THE SKIN WE HAVE HUGE STORES NOT OF NITRIC OXIDE BECAUSE NITRIC OXIDE IS A GAS AND IT 'S RELEASED POOF AND IN A FEW SECONDS IT 'S AWAY
RichardWeller_2012X@403.62:423.34 AND WE THEN THOUGHT TO OURSELVES WITH THOSE BIG STORES I WONDER IF SUNLIGHT MIGHT ACTIVATE THOSE STORES AND RELEASE THEM FROM THE SKIN WHERE THE STORES ARE ABOUT TEN TIMES AS BIG AS WHAT 'S IN THE CIRCULATION COULD THE SUN ACTIVATE THOSE STORES INTO THE CIRCULATION AND THERE IN THE CIRCULATION DO ITS GOOD THINGS FOR YOUR CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM
RichardWeller_2012X@423.34:430.56 WELL I 'M AN EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGIST SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE THOUGHT WE 'D HAVE TO EXPOSE OUR EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS TO SUNLIGHT
RichardWeller_2012X@430.56:441.21 AND SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE TOOK A BUNCH OF VOLUNTEERS AND WE EXPOSED THEM TO ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT SO THESE ARE KIND OF SUNLAMPS NOW WHAT WE WERE CAREFUL TO DO
RichardWeller_2012X@441.21:452.64 WAS VITAMIN D IS MADE BY ULTRAVIOLET B RAYS AND WE WANTED TO SEPARATE OUR STORY FROM THE VITAMIN D STORY SO WE USED ULTRAVIOLET A WHICH DOESN 'T MAKE VITAMIN D
RichardWeller_2012X@452.64:469.88 WHEN WE PUT PEOPLE UNDER A LAMP FOR THE EQUIVALENT OF ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES OF SUNSHINE IN SUMMER IN EDINBURGH WHAT WE PRODUCED WAS WE PRODUCED A RISE IN CIRCULATING NITRIC OXIDE SO WE PUT PATIENTS WITH THESE SUBJECTS UNDER THE UV AND THEIR NO LEVELS DO GO UP
RichardWeller_2012X@469.88:480.65 AND THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE GOES DOWN NOT BY MUCH AS AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL BUT ENOUGH AT A POPULATION LEVEL TO SHIFT THE RATES OF HEART DISEASE IN A WHOLE POPULATION
RichardWeller_2012X@480.65:493.68 AND WHEN WE SHONE UV AT THEM OR WHEN WE WARMED THEM UP TO THE SAME LEVEL AS THE LAMPS BUT DIDN 'T ACTUALLY LET THE RAYS HIT THE SKIN THIS DIDN 'T HAPPEN SO THIS SEEMS TO BE A FEATURE OF ULTRAVIOLET RAYS HITTING THE SKIN
RichardWeller_2012X@493.68:507.13 NOW WE 'RE STILL COLLECTING DATA A FEW GOOD THINGS HERE THIS APPEARED TO BE MORE MARKED IN OLDER PEOPLE I 'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW MUCH ONE OF THE SUBJECTS HERE WAS MY MOTHER IN LAW AND CLEARLY I DO NOT KNOW HER AGE BUT CERTAINLY
RichardWeller_2012X@540.76:552.09 SO WHAT WE 'VE NEXT DONE IS WE 'VE MOVED ON TO LOOKING AT BLOOD VESSEL DILATATION SO WE 'VE MEASURED THIS IS AGAIN NOTICE NO TAIL AND HAIRLESS THIS IS A MEDICAL STUDENT
RichardWeller_2012X@552.09:558.81 IN THE ARM YOU CAN MEASURE BLOOD FLOW IN THE ARM BY HOW MUCH IT SWELLS UP AS SOME BLOOD FLOWS INTO IT
RichardWeller_2012X@586.75:595.19 SO HERE FURTHER DATA THAT ULTRAVIOLET THAT 'S SUNLIGHT HAS BENEFITS ON THE BLOOD FLOW AND THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM
RichardWeller_2012X@595.19:597.88 SO WE THOUGHT WE 'D JUST KIND OF MODEL
RichardWeller_2012X@600.31:619.84 HIT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE EARTH AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF YEAR SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY WORK OUT THOSE STORES OF NITRIC OXIDE THE NITRATES NITRITES NITROSOTHIOLS IN THE SKIN CLEAVE TO RELEASE NO DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES OF DOING THAT SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THE WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT THAT DO THAT
RichardWeller_2012X@619.84:639.72 AND YOU CAN LOOK SO IF YOU LIVE ON THE EQUATOR THE SUN COMES STRAIGHT OVERHEAD IT COMES THROUGH A VERY THIN BIT OF ATMOSPHERE IN WINTER OR SUMMER IT 'S THE SAME AMOUNT OF LIGHT IF YOU LIVE UP HERE IN SUMMER THE SUN IS COMING FAIRLY DIRECTLY DOWN BUT IN WINTER IT 'S COMING THROUGH A HUGE AMOUNT OF ATMOSPHERE AND MUCH OF THE ULTRAVIOLET IS WEEDED OUT
RichardWeller_2012X@639.72:643.98 AND THE RANGE OF WAVELENGTHS THAT HIT THE EARTH ARE DIFFERENT FROM SUMMER TO WINTER
RichardWeller_2012X@643.98:654.75 SO WHAT YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN MULTIPLY THOSE DATA BY THE NO THAT 'S RELEASED AND YOU CAN CALCULATE HOW MUCH NITRIC OXIDE WOULD BE RELEASED FROM THE SKIN INTO THE CIRCULATION
RichardWeller_2012X@684.35:695.25 IN SUMMER THE AREA BENEATH THE CURVE IS PRETTY GOOD BUT EDINBURGH IN WINTER THE AMOUNT OF NO THAT CAN BE RELEASED IS NEXT TO NOTHING TINY AMOUNTS
RichardWeller_2012X@695.25:707.23 SO WHAT DO WE THINK WE 'RE STILL WORKING AT THIS STORY WE 'RE STILL DEVELOPING IT WE 'RE STILL EXPANDING IT WE THINK IT 'S VERY IMPORTANT WE THINK IT PROBABLY ACCOUNTS FOR A LOT OF THE NORTH SOUTH HEALTH DIVIDE WITHIN BRITAIN IT 'S OF RELEVANCE TO US
RichardWeller_2012X@707.23:721.49 WE THINK THAT THE SKIN WELL WE KNOW THAT THE SKIN HAS GOT VERY LARGE STORES OF NITRIC OXIDE AS THESE VARIOUS OTHER FORMS WE SUSPECT A LOT OF THESE COME FROM DIET GREEN LEAFY VEGETABLES BEETROOT LETTUCE HAS A LOT OF THESE NITRIC OXIDES THAT WE THINK GO TO THE SKIN
RichardWeller_2012X@721.49:723.99 WE THINK THEY 'RE THEN STORED IN THE SKIN
RichardWeller_2012X@723.99:728.7 AND WE THINK THE SUNLIGHT RELEASES THIS WHERE IT HAS GENERALLY BENEFICIAL EFFECTS
RichardWeller_2012X@737.3:749.24 I ACTUALLY THINK A FAR MORE IMPORTANT MESSAGE IS THAT THERE ARE BENEFITS AS WELL AS RISKS TO SUNLIGHT YES SUNLIGHT IS THE MAJOR ALTERABLE RISK FACTOR FOR SKIN CANCER
RichardWeller_2012X@749.24:760.58 BUT DEATHS FROM HEART DISEASE ARE A HUNDRED TIMES HIGHER THAN DEATHS FROM SKIN CANCER AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE MORE AWARE OF AND WE NEED TO FIND THE RISK BENEFIT RATIO HOW MUCH SUNLIGHT IS SAFE
