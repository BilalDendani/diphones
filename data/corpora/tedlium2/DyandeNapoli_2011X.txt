DyandeNapoli_2011X@17.15:28.07 AS I CAN REMEMBER I HAVE FELT A VERY DEEP CONNECTION TO ANIMALS AND TO THE OCEAN AND AT THIS AGE MY PERSONAL IDOL WAS FLIPPER THE DOLPHIN
DyandeNapoli_2011X@28.07:32.64 AND WHEN I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT ENDANGERED SPECIES I WAS TRULY
DyandeNapoli_2011X@32.64:50.94 DISTRESSED TO KNOW THAT EVERY DAY ANIMALS WERE BEING WIPED OFF THE FACE OF THIS EARTH FOREVER AND I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP BUT I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT COULD ONE PERSON POSSIBLY DO TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND IT WOULD BE THIRTY YEARS BUT I WOULD EVENTUALLY GET THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
DyandeNapoli_2011X@50.94:59.8 WHEN THESE HEARTBREAKING IMAGES OF OILED BIRDS FINALLY BEGAN TO EMERGE FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO LAST YEAR DURING THE HORRIFIC BP OIL SPILL
DyandeNapoli_2011X@59.8:72.99 A GERMAN BIOLOGIST BY THE NAME OF SILVIA GAUS WAS QUOTED AS SAYING WE SHOULD JUST EUTHANIZE ALL OILED BIRDS BECAUSE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT FEWER THAN ONE PERCENT OF THEM SURVIVE AFTER BEING RELEASED
DyandeNapoli_2011X@72.99:84.23 AND I COULD NOT DISAGREE MORE AND IN ADDITION I BELIEVE THAT EVERY OILED ANIMAL DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE AND I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY I FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT THIS
DyandeNapoli_2011X@84.23:103.25 ON JUNE TWENTY THIRD TWO THOUSAND A SHIP NAMED THE TREASURE SANK OFF THE COAST OF CAPE TOWN SOUTH AFRICA SPILLING ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TONS OF FUEL WHICH POLLUTED THE HABITATS OF NEARLY HALF THE ENTIRE WORLD POPULATION OF AFRICAN PENGUINS NOW THE SHIP SANK BETWEEN ROBBEN ISLAND TO THE SOUTH
DyandeNapoli_2011X@103.25:122 AND DASSEN ISLAND TO THE NORTH AND THESE ARE TWO OF THE PENGUINS MAIN BREEDING ISLANDS AND EXACTLY SIX YEARS AND THREE DAYS EARLIER ON JUNE TWENTIETH ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR A SHIP NAMED THE APOLLO SEA SANK NEAR DASSEN ISLAND OILING TEN THOUSAND PENGUINS HALF OF WHICH DIED
DyandeNapoli_2011X@122.26:139.27 NOW WHEN THE TREASURE SANK IN TWO THOUSAND IT WAS THE HEIGHT OF THE BEST BREEDING SEASON SCIENTISTS HAD EVER RECORDED FOR THE AFRICAN PENGUIN WHICH AT THE TIME WAS LISTED AS A THREATENED SPECIES AND SOON NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND PENGUINS WERE COVERED WITH THIS TOXIC OIL
DyandeNapoli_2011X@139.27:150.33 AND THE LOCAL SEABIRD RESCUE CENTER NAMED SANCCOB IMMEDIATELY LAUNCHED A MASSIVE RESCUE OPERATION AND THIS SOON WOULD BECOME THE LARGEST ANIMAL RESCUE EVER UNDERTAKEN
DyandeNapoli_2011X@150.33:155.21 NOW AT THE TIME I WAS WORKING DOWN THE STREET I WAS A PENGUIN AQUARIST AT THE NEW ENGLAND AQUARIUM
DyandeNapoli_2011X@155.21:159.74 AND EXACTLY ELEVEN YEARS AGO YESTERDAY THE
DyandeNapoli_2011X@159.74:177.43 PHONE RANG IN THE PENGUIN OFFICE AND WITH THAT CALL MY LIFE WOULD CHANGE FOREVER IT WAS ESTELLE VAN DER MEER CALLING FROM SANCCOB SAYING PLEASE COME HELP WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF OILED PENGUINS AND THOUSANDS OF WILLING BUT COMPLETELY INEXPERIENCED VOLUNTEERS
DyandeNapoli_2011X@177.43:181.05 AND WE NEED PENGUIN EXPERTS TO COME TRAIN AND SUPERVISE THEM
DyandeNapoli_2011X@181.05:187.03 SO TWO DAYS LATER I WAS ON A PLANE HEADED FOR CAPE TOWN WITH A TEAM OF PENGUIN SPECIALISTS
DyandeNapoli_2011X@187.03:206.51 AND THE SCENE INSIDE OF THIS BUILDING WAS DEVASTATING AND SURREAL IN FACT MANY PEOPLE COMPARED IT TO A WAR ZONE AND LAST WEEK A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL ASKED ME WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE WHEN YOU FIRST WALKED INTO THAT BUILDING AND SAW SO MANY OILED PENGUINS
DyandeNapoli_2011X@206.83:212.48 AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED I WAS INSTANTLY TRANSPORTED BACK TO THAT MOMENT IN TIME
DyandeNapoli_2011X@225.86:231.95 THROUGH THOSE DOORS AND INTO THE BUILDING IT WAS EERILY SILENT
DyandeNapoli_2011X@239.91:251.55 WAS THE SHEER NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS UP TO ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE A DAY CAME TO THE RESCUE CENTER AND EVENTUALLY OVER THE COURSE OF THIS RESCUE MORE THAN TWELVE AND A HALF THOUSAND
DyandeNapoli_2011X@251.55:262.41 VOLUNTEERS CAME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO CAPE TOWN TO HELP SAVE THESE BIRDS AND THE AMAZING THING WAS THAT NOT ONE OF THEM HAD TO BE THERE YET THEY WERE
DyandeNapoli_2011X@262.41:272.68 SO FOR THE FEW OF US THAT WERE THERE IN A PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY THIS EXTRAORDINARY VOLUNTEER RESPONSE TO THIS ANIMAL CRISIS WAS PROFOUNDLY MOVING AND AWE INSPIRING
DyandeNapoli_2011X@272.68:290.85 SO THE DAY AFTER WE ARRIVED TWO OF US FROM THE AQUARIUM WERE PUT IN CHARGE OF ROOM TWO AND ROOM TWO HAD MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND OILED PENGUINS IN IT NOW MIND YOU THREE DAYS EARLIER WE HAD SIXTY PENGUINS UNDER OUR CARE SO WE WERE DEFINITELY OVERWHELMED AND JUST A BIT TERRIFIED AT LEAST I WAS
DyandeNapoli_2011X@290.85:301.64 PERSONALLY I REALLY DIDN 'T KNOW IF I WAS CAPABLE OF HANDLING SUCH A MONSTROUS TASK AND COLLECTIVELY WE REALLY DIDN 'T KNOW IF WE COULD PULL THIS OFF
DyandeNapoli_2011X@301.64:317.03 BECAUSE WE ALL KNEW THAT JUST SIX YEARS EARLIER HALF AS MANY PENGUINS HAD BEEN OILED AND RESCUED AND ONLY HALF OF THEM HAD SURVIVED SO WOULD IT BE HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO SAVE THIS MANY OILED PENGUINS WE JUST DID NOT KNOW
DyandeNapoli_2011X@317.03:325.27 BUT WHAT GAVE US HOPE WERE THESE INCREDIBLY DEDICATED AND BRAVE VOLUNTEERS THREE OF WHOM HERE ARE FORCE FEEDING PENGUINS
DyandeNapoli_2011X@325.27:340.71 AND YOU MAY NOTICE THEY 'RE WEARING VERY THICK GLOVES AND WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT AFRICAN PENGUINS IS THAT THEY HAVE RAZOR SHARP BEAKS AND BEFORE LONG OUR BODIES WERE COVERED HEAD TO TOE WITH THESE NASTY WOUNDS INFLICTED BY THE TERRIFIED PENGUINS
DyandeNapoli_2011X@340.81:352.59 NOW THE DAY AFTER WE ARRIVED A NEW CRISIS BEGAN TO UNFOLD THE OIL SLICK WAS NOW MOVING NORTH TOWARDS DASSEN ISLAND AND THE RESCUERS DESPAIRED BECAUSE THEY KNEW IF THE OIL HIT
DyandeNapoli_2011X@352.59:372.58 IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO RESCUE ANY MORE OILED BIRDS AND THERE REALLY WERE NO GOOD SOLUTIONS BUT THEN FINALLY ONE OF THE RESEARCHERS THREW OUT THIS CRAZY IDEA HE SAID OKAY WHY DON 'T WE TRY AND COLLECT THE BIRDS AT THE GREATEST RISK OF GETTING OILED THEY COLLECTED TWENTY THOUSAND AND WE 'LL SHIP THEM FIVE HUNDRED MILES UP THE COAST
DyandeNapoli_2011X@383.23:401.19 SO THREE OF THOSE PENGUINS PETER PAMELA AND PERCY WORE SATELLITE TAGS AND THE RESEARCHERS CROSSED THEIR FINGERS AND HOPED THAT BY THE TIME THEY GOT BACK HOME THE OIL WOULD BE CLEANED UP FROM THEIR ISLANDS AND LUCKILY THE DAY THEY ARRIVED IT WAS SO IT HAD BEEN A HUGE GAMBLE BUT IT HAD PAID OFF
DyandeNapoli_2011X@401.19:415.87 AND SO THEY KNOW NOW THAT THEY CAN USE THIS STRATEGY IN FUTURE OIL SPILLS SO IN WILDLIFE RESCUE AS IN LIFE WE LEARN FROM EACH PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE AND WE LEARN FROM BOTH OUR SUCCESSES AND OUR FAILURES
DyandeNapoli_2011X@415.87:432.3 AND THE MAIN THING LEARNED DURING THE APOLLO SEA RESCUE IN NINETY FOUR WAS THAT MOST OF THOSE PENGUINS HAD DIED DUE TO THE UNWITTING USE OF POORLY VENTILATED TRANSPORT BOXES AND TRUCKS BECAUSE THEY JUST HAD NOT BEEN PREPARED TO DEAL WITH SO MANY OILED PENGUINS AT ONCE
DyandeNapoli_2011X@432.3:451.01 SO IN THESE SIX YEARS BETWEEN THESE TWO OIL SPILLS THEY BUILT THOUSANDS OF THESE WELL VENTILATED BOXES AND AS A RESULT DURING THE TREASURE RESCUE JUST ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY PENGUINS DIED DURING THE TRANSPORT PROCESS AS OPPOSED TO FIVE THOUSAND SO THIS ALONE WAS A HUGE VICTORY
DyandeNapoli_2011X@451.01:463.7 SOMETHING ELSE LEARNED DURING THE APOLLO RESCUE WAS HOW TO TRAIN THE PENGUINS TO TAKE FISH FREELY FROM THEIR HANDS USING THESE TRAINING BOXES AND WE USED THIS TECHNIQUE AGAIN DURING THE TREASURE RESCUE
DyandeNapoli_2011X@481.46:499.08 SO ALL OF THOSE PENGUINS HAD TO HAVE THE OIL METICULOUSLY CLEANED FROM THEIR BODIES AND IT WOULD TAKE TWO PEOPLE AT LEAST AN HOUR JUST TO CLEAN ONE PENGUIN AND WHEN YOU CLEAN A PENGUIN YOU FIRST HAVE TO SPRAY IT WITH A DEGREASER AND THIS BRINGS ME TO MY FAVORITE STORY FROM THE TREASURE RESCUE
DyandeNapoli_2011X@499.08:505.77 ABOUT A YEAR PRIOR TO THIS OIL SPILL A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD STUDENT HAD INVENTED A DEGREASER
DyandeNapoli_2011X@505.77:508.65 AND THEY 'D BEEN USING IT AT SANCCOB WITH GREAT SUCCESS
DyandeNapoli_2011X@508.65:521.79 SO THEY BEGAN USING IT DURING THE TREASURE RESCUE BUT PART WAY THROUGH THEY RAN OUT SO IN A PANIC ESTELLE FROM SANCCOB CALLED THE STUDENT AND SAID PLEASE YOU HAVE TO MAKE MORE SO HE RACED TO THE LAB AND MADE ENOUGH
DyandeNapoli_2011X@521.79:534.22 TO CLEAN THE REST OF THE BIRDS SO I JUST THINK IT IS THE COOLEST THING THAT A TEENAGER INVENTED A PRODUCT THAT HELPED SAVE THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS
DyandeNapoli_2011X@534.22:553.1 SO WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE TWENTY THOUSAND OILED PENGUINS AND WAS SILVIA GAUS RIGHT SHOULD WE ROUTINELY EUTHANIZE ALL OILED BIRDS BECAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE GOING TO DIE ANYWAY WELL SHE COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG AFTER HALF A MILLION HOURS OF GRUELING VOLUNTEER LABOR
DyandeNapoli_2011X@553.17:567.52 MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF THOSE OILED PENGUINS WERE SUCCESSFULLY RETURNED TO THE WILD AND WE KNOW FROM FOLLOW UP STUDIES THAT THEY HAVE LIVED JUST AS LONG AS NEVER OILED PENGUINS AND BRED NEARLY AS SUCCESSFULLY
DyandeNapoli_2011X@567.52:583.4 AND IN ADDITION ABOUT THREE THOUSAND PENGUIN CHICKS WERE RESCUED AND HAND RAISED AND AGAIN WE KNOW FROM LONG TERM MONITORING THAT MORE OF THESE HAND RAISED CHICKS SURVIVE TO ADULTHOOD AND BREEDING AGE THAN DO PARENT RAISED CHICKS
DyandeNapoli_2011X@583.4:594.42 SO ARMED WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE SANCCOB HAS A CHICK BOLSTERING PROJECT AND EVERY YEAR THEY RESCUE AND RAISE ABANDONED CHICKS AND THEY HAVE A VERY IMPRESSIVE EIGHTY PERCENT SUCCESS RATE
DyandeNapoli_2011X@594.42:608.54 AND THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONE YEAR AGO THE AFRICAN PENGUIN WAS DECLARED ENDANGERED AND THEY COULD BE EXTINCT IN LESS THAN TEN YEARS IF WE DON 'T DO SOMETHING NOW TO PROTECT THEM
DyandeNapoli_2011X@608.54:624.59 SO WHAT DID I LEARN FROM THIS INTENSE AND UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE PERSONALLY I LEARNED THAT I AM CAPABLE OF HANDLING SO MUCH MORE THAN I EVER DREAMED POSSIBLE AND I LEARNED THAT ONE PERSON CAN MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE JUST LOOK AT THAT SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD
DyandeNapoli_2011X@624.59:631.12 AND WHEN WE COME TOGETHER AND WORK AS ONE WE CAN ACHIEVE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS
DyandeNapoli_2011X@631.12:638.96 AND TRULY TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING SO MUCH LARGER THAN YOURSELF IS THE MOST REWARDING EXPERIENCE YOU CAN POSSIBLY HAVE
DyandeNapoli_2011X@639.28:649.74 SO I 'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH ONE FINAL THOUGHT AND A CHALLENGE IF YOU WILL MY MISSION AS THE PENGUIN LADY IS TO RAISE AWARENESS AND FUNDING TO PROTECT PENGUINS
DyandeNapoli_2011X@649.74:665.22 BUT WHY SHOULD ANY OF YOU CARE ABOUT PENGUINS WELL YOU SHOULD CARE BECAUSE THEY 'RE AN INDICATOR SPECIES AND SIMPLY PUT IF PENGUINS ARE DYING IT MEANS OUR OCEANS ARE DYING AND WE ULTIMATELY WILL BE AFFECTED BECAUSE AS SYLVIA EARLE SAYS
DyandeNapoli_2011X@665.22:679.17 THE OCEANS ARE OUR LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM AND THE TWO MAIN THREATS TO PENGUINS TODAY ARE OVERFISHING AND GLOBAL WARMING AND THESE ARE TWO THINGS THAT EACH ONE OF US ACTUALLY HAS THE POWER TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
DyandeNapoli_2011X@679.17:686.74 SO IF WE EACH DO OUR PART TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND WE CAN HELP KEEP PENGUINS FROM GOING EXTINCT
DyandeNapoli_2011X@686.74:692.17 HUMANS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE GREATEST THREAT TO PENGUINS BUT WE ARE NOW THEIR ONLY HOPE
