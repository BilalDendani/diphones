DeniseHerzing_2013 NOW WE 'RE GOING TO THE BAHAMAS TO MEET A REMARKABLE GROUP OF DOLPHINS THAT I 'VE BEEN WORKING WITH IN THE WILD FOR THE LAST TWENTY EIGHT YEARS
DeniseHerzing_2013 NOW I 'M INTERESTED IN DOLPHINS BECAUSE OF THEIR LARGE BRAINS AND WHAT THEY MIGHT BE DOING WITH ALL THAT BRAINPOWER IN THE WILD AND WE KNOW THEY USE SOME OF THAT BRAINPOWER FOR JUST LIVING COMPLICATED LIVES BUT WHAT DO WE REALLY KNOW ABOUT DOLPHIN INTELLIGENCE
DeniseHerzing_2013 WELL WE KNOW A FEW THINGS WE KNOW THAT THEIR BRAIN TO BODY RATIO WHICH IS A PHYSICAL MEASURE OF INTELLIGENCE IS SECOND ONLY TO HUMANS
DeniseHerzing_2013 COGNITIVELY THEY CAN UNDERSTAND ARTIFICIALLY CREATED LANGUAGES
DeniseHerzing_2013 AND THEY PASS SELF AWARENESS TESTS IN MIRRORS AND IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD THEY USE TOOLS LIKE SPONGES TO HUNT FISH
DeniseHerzing_2013 BUT THERE 'S ONE BIG QUESTION LEFT
DeniseHerzing_2013 DO THEY HAVE A LANGUAGE AND IF SO WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT
DeniseHerzing_2013 SO DECADES AGO NOT YEARS AGO I SET OUT TO FIND A PLACE IN THE WORLD WHERE I COULD OBSERVE DOLPHINS UNDERWATER TO TRY TO CRACK THE CODE OF THEIR COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
DeniseHerzing_2013 NOW IN MOST PARTS OF THE WORLD THE WATER 'S PRETTY MURKY SO IT 'S VERY HARD TO OBSERVE ANIMALS UNDERWATER
DeniseHerzing_2013 BUT I FOUND A COMMUNITY OF DOLPHINS THAT LIVE IN THESE BEAUTIFUL CLEAR SHALLOW SANDBANKS OF THE BAHAMAS WHICH ARE JUST EAST OF FLORIDA AND THEY SPEND THEIR DAYTIME RESTING AND SOCIALIZING IN THE SAFETY OF THE SHALLOWS BUT AT NIGHT THEY GO OFF THE EDGE AND HUNT IN DEEP WATER
DeniseHerzing_2013 NOW IT 'S NOT A BAD PLACE TO BE A RESEARCHER EITHER SO WE GO OUT FOR ABOUT FIVE MONTHS EVERY SUMMER IN A TWENTY METER CATAMARAN AND WE LIVE SLEEP AND WORK AT SEA FOR WEEKS AT A TIME
DeniseHerzing_2013 MY MAIN TOOL IS AN UNDERWATER VIDEO WITH A HYDROPHONE WHICH IS AN UNDERWATER MICROPHONE AND THIS IS SO I CAN CORRELATE SOUND AND BEHAVIOR AND MOST OF OUR WORK 'S PRETTY NON INVASIVE WE TRY TO FOLLOW DOLPHIN ETIQUETTE WHILE WE 'RE IN THE WATER SINCE WE 'RE ACTUALLY OBSERVING THEM PHYSICALLY IN THE WATER
DeniseHerzing_2013 NOW ATLANTIC SPOTTED DOLPHINS ARE A REALLY NICE SPECIES TO WORK WITH FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS THEY 'RE BORN WITHOUT SPOTS AND THEY GET SPOTS WITH AGE
DeniseHerzing_2013 NOW YOUNG DOLPHINS LEARN A LOT AS THEY 'RE GROWING UP AND THEY USE THEIR TEENAGE YEARS TO PRACTICE SOCIAL SKILLS AND AT ABOUT THE AGE OF NINE THE FEMALES BECOME SEXUALLY MATURE SO THEY CAN GET PREGNANT AND THE MALES MATURE QUITE A BIT LATER AT AROUND FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE
DeniseHerzing_2013 AND DOLPHINS ARE VERY PROMISCUOUS AND SO WE HAVE TO DETERMINE WHO THE FATHERS ARE SO WE DO PATERNITY TESTS BY COLLECTING FECAL MATERIAL OUT OF THE WATER AND EXTRACTING DNA SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS AFTER TWENTY EIGHT YEARS WE ARE TRACKING THREE GENERATIONS INCLUDING GRANDMOTHERS AND GRANDFATHERS
DeniseHerzing_2013 AND THEY HAVE TOUCH AND SOUND CAN ACTUALLY BE FELT IN THE WATER BECAUSE THE ACOUSTIC IMPEDANCE OF TISSUE AND WATER 'S ABOUT THE SAME SO DOLPHINS CAN BUZZ AND TICKLE EACH OTHER AT A DISTANCE
DeniseHerzing_2013 TO AN INDIVIDUAL DOLPHIN AND IT 'S LIKE A NAME
DeniseHerzing_2013 ANOTHER WELL STUDIED SOUND ARE ECHOLOCATION CLICKS THIS IS THE DOLPHIN 'S SONAR DOLPHIN ECHOLOCATION NOISES AND THEY USE THESE CLICKS TO HUNT AND FEED BUT THEY CAN ALSO TIGHTLY PACK THESE CLICKS TOGETHER INTO BUZZES AND USE THEM SOCIALLY FOR EXAMPLE MALES WILL STIMULATE
DeniseHerzing_2013 YOU KNOW I 'VE BEEN BUZZED IN THE WATER
DeniseHerzing_2013 AND ONE OF THE MECHANISMS THEY USE TO COMMUNICATE THEIR COORDINATION IS SYNCHRONY THEY SYNCHRONIZE
DeniseHerzing_2013 THEIR SOUNDS AND THEIR BODY POSTURES TO LOOK BIGGER AND SOUND STRONGER DOLPHINS NOISES NOW THESE ARE BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS AND YOU 'LL SEE THEM STARTING TO SYNCHRONIZE THEIR BEHAVIOR AND
DeniseHerzing_2013 NOW RESEARCHERS HAVE ACTUALLY MEASURED WHISTLE COMPLEXITY USING INFORMATION THEORY AND WHISTLES RATE VERY HIGH RELATIVE TO EVEN HUMAN LANGUAGES BUT BURST PULSED SOUNDS IS A BIT OF A MYSTERY
DeniseHerzing_2013 NOW THESE ARE THREE SPECTRAGRAMS TWO ARE HUMAN WORDS AND ONE IS A DOLPHIN VOCALIZING SO JUST TAKE A GUESS IN YOUR MIND WHICH ONE IS THE DOLPHIN
DeniseHerzing_2013 NOW IT TURNS OUT BURST PULSED SOUNDS ACTUALLY LOOK A BIT LIKE HUMAN PHONEMES
DeniseHerzing_2013 NOW ONE WAY TO CRACK THE CODE IS TO INTERPRET THESE SIGNALS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY MEAN BUT IT 'S A DIFFICULT JOB AND WE ACTUALLY DON 'T HAVE A ROSETTA STONE YET BUT A SECOND WAY TO CRACK THE CODE IS TO DEVELOP SOME TECHNOLOGY AN INTERFACE TO DO TWO WAY COMMUNICATION AND THAT 'S WHAT WE 'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IN THE BAHAMAS AND IN REAL TIME
DeniseHerzing_2013 NOW SCIENTISTS HAVE USED KEYBOARD INTERFACES TO TRY TO BRIDGE THE GAP WITH SPECIES INCLUDING CHIMPANZEES AND DOLPHINS THIS UNDERWATER KEYBOARD IN ORLANDO FLORIDA AT THE EPCOT CENTER WAS ACTUALLY THE MOST SOPHISTICATED EVER TWO WAY INTERFACE DESIGNED FOR HUMANS AND DOLPHINS TO WORK TOGETHER UNDER THE WATER AND EXCHANGE INFORMATION
DeniseHerzing_2013 SO WE WANTED TO DEVELOP AN INTERFACE LIKE THIS IN THE BAHAMAS BUT IN A MORE NATURAL SETTING
DeniseHerzing_2013 AND ONE OF THE REASONS WE THOUGHT WE COULD DO THIS IS BECAUSE THE DOLPHINS WERE STARTING TO SHOW US A LOT OF MUTUAL CURIOSITY THEY WERE SPONTANEOUSLY MIMICKING OUR VOCALIZATIONS AND OUR POSTURES AND THEY WERE ALSO INVITING US INTO DOLPHIN GAMES
DeniseHerzing_2013 NOW DOLPHINS ARE SOCIAL MAMMALS SO THEY LOVE TO PLAY AND ONE OF THEIR FAVORITE
DeniseHerzing_2013 GAMES IS TO DRAG SEAWEED OR SARGASSUM IN THIS CASE AROUND
DeniseHerzing_2013 AND SO WE STARTED THINKING WELL WOULDN 'T IT BE NEAT TO BUILD SOME TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD ALLOW THE DOLPHINS TO REQUEST THESE THINGS IN REAL TIME THEIR FAVORITE TOYS SO THE ORIGINAL VISION WAS TO HAVE A KEYBOARD HANGING FROM THE BOAT ATTACHED TO A COMPUTER AND THE DIVERS AND DOLPHINS WOULD ACTIVATE THE KEYS ON THE KEYPAD AND HAPPILY EXCHANGE INFORMATION AND REQUEST
DeniseHerzing_2013 TOYS FROM EACH OTHER BUT WE QUICKLY FOUND OUT THAT DOLPHINS SIMPLY WERE NOT GOING TO HANG AROUND THE BOAT USING A KEYBOARD
DeniseHerzing_2013 THEY 'VE GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO IN THE WILD THEY MIGHT DO IT IN CAPTIVITY BUT IN THE WILD SO WE BUILT A PORTABLE KEYBOARD THAT WE COULD PUSH THROUGH THE WATER
DeniseHerzing_2013 AND WE LABELED FOUR OBJECTS THEY LIKE TO PLAY WITH THE SCARF ROPE SARGASSUM AND ALSO HAD A BOW RIDE WHICH IS A FUN ACTIVITY FOR
DeniseHerzing_2013 WHICH IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH A VISUAL SYMBOL AND THESE ARE ARTIFICIALLY CREATED WHISTLES THEY 'RE OUTSIDE THE DOLPHIN 'S NORMAL REPERTOIRE BUT THEY 'RE EASILY MIMICKED BY THE DOLPHINS
DeniseHerzing_2013 AND I SPENT FOUR YEARS WITH MY COLLEAGUES ADAM PACK AND FABIENNE DELFOUR WORKING OUT IN THE FIELD WITH THIS KEYBOARD USING IT WITH EACH OTHER TO DO REQUESTS FOR TOYS WHILE THE DOLPHINS WERE WATCHING AND THE DOLPHINS COULD GET IN ON THE GAME THEY COULD POINT AT THE VISUAL OBJECT OR THEY COULD MIMIC THE WHISTLE
DeniseHerzing_2013 NOW THIS IS VIDEO OF A SESSION THE DIVER HERE HAS A ROPE TOY
DeniseHerzing_2013 AND I 'M ON THE KEYBOARD ON THE LEFT AND I 'VE JUST PLAYED THE ROPE KEY AND THAT 'S THE REQUEST FOR THE TOY FROM THE HUMAN
DeniseHerzing_2013 SO I 'VE GOT THE ROPE I 'M DIVING DOWN AND I 'M BASICALLY TRYING TO GET THE DOLPHIN 'S ATTENTION BECAUSE THEY 'RE KIND OF LIKE LITTLE
DeniseHerzing_2013 NOW THIS DOLPHIN WE CALL HER THE SCARF THIEF BECAUSE OVER THE YEARS SHE 'S ABSCONDED WITH ABOUT TWELVE SCARVES
DeniseHerzing_2013 SO I 'M REACHING OVER SHE 'S GOT THE SCARF ON HER RIGHT SIDE AND WE TRY TO NOT TOUCH THE ANIMALS TOO MUCH WE REALLY DON 'T WANT TO OVER HABITUATE THEM AND I 'M TRYING TO LEAD HER BACK TO THE KEYBOARD
DeniseHerzing_2013 AND THE DIVER THERE IS GOING TO ACTIVATE THE SCARF SOUND TO REQUEST THE SCARF SO I TRY TO GIVE HER THE SCARF
DeniseHerzing_2013 AND THIS SOMETIMES WENT ON FOR HOURS AND I WANTED TO SHARE THIS VIDEO WITH YOU NOT TO SHOW YOU ANY BIG BREAKTHROUGHS BECAUSE THEY HAVEN 'T HAPPENED YET BUT TO SHOW YOU THE LEVEL OF INTENTION AND FOCUS THAT THESE DOLPHINS HAVE AND INTEREST IN THE SYSTEM AND BECAUSE OF THIS WE REALLY DECIDED WE NEEDED SOME MORE SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY
DeniseHerzing_2013 SO WE JOINED FORCES WITH GEORGIA TECH WITH THAD STARNER 'S WEARABLE COMPUTING GROUP TO BUILD US AN UNDERWATER WEARABLE COMPUTER THAT WE 'RE CALLING CHAT
DeniseHerzing_2013 SO BASICALLY THE DIVER ACTIVATES THE SOUNDS ON A KEYPAD ON THE FOREARM THE SOUNDS GO OUT THROUGH AN UNDERWATER SPEAKER IF A DOLPHIN MIMICS THE WHISTLE OR A HUMAN PLAYS THE WHISTLE THE SOUNDS COME IN AND ARE LOCALIZED BY TWO HYDROPHONES THE COMPUTER CAN LOCALIZE WHO REQUESTED THE TOY IF THERE 'S A WORD MATCH
DeniseHerzing_2013 AND THE REAL POWER OF THE SYSTEM IS IN THE REAL TIME SOUND RECOGNITION SO WE CAN RESPOND TO THE DOLPHINS QUICKLY AND ACCURATELY AND
DeniseHerzing_2013 SO DIVER A PLAYS THE SCARF WHISTLE OR DIVER B PLAYS THE SARGASSUM WHISTLE TO REQUEST A TOY FROM WHOEVER HAS IT WHAT WE HOPE WILL HAPPEN
DeniseHerzing_2013 IS THAT THE DOLPHIN MIMICS THE WHISTLE AND IF DIVER A HAS THE SARGASSUM IF THAT 'S THE SOUND THAT WAS PLAYED AND REQUESTED THEN THE DIVER WILL GIVE THE SARGASSUM TO THE REQUESTING DOLPHIN AND THEY 'LL SWIM AWAY HAPPILY INTO THE SUNSET PLAYING SARGASSUM FOR
DeniseHerzing_2013 WELL CHAT IS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO EMPOWER THE DOLPHINS TO REQUEST THINGS FROM US
DeniseHerzing_2013 IT 'S DESIGNED TO REALLY BE TWO WAY NOW WILL THEY LEARN TO MIMIC THE WHISTLES FUNCTIONALLY
DeniseHerzing_2013 WE HOPE SO AND WE THINK SO BUT AS WE DECODE THEIR NATURAL SOUNDS WE 'RE ALSO PLANNING TO PUT THOSE BACK INTO THE COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW WE CAN PUT THEIR OWN SIGNATURE WHISTLES IN THE COMPUTER AND REQUEST TO INTERACT WITH A SPECIFIC DOLPHIN
DeniseHerzing_2013 LIKEWISE WE CAN CREATE OUR OWN WHISTLES OUR OWN WHISTLE NAMES AND LET THE DOLPHINS REQUEST SPECIFIC DIVERS TO INTERACT WITH
DeniseHerzing_2013 NOW IT MAY BE THAT ALL OUR MOBILE TECHNOLOGY WILL ACTUALLY BE THE SAME TECHNOLOGY THAT HELPS US COMMUNICATE WITH ANOTHER SPECIES DOWN THE ROAD
DeniseHerzing_2013 IN THE CASE OF A DOLPHIN YOU KNOW IT 'S A SPECIES THAT WELL THEY 'RE PROBABLY CLOSE TO OUR INTELLIGENCE IN MANY WAYS AND WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO ADMIT THAT RIGHT NOW BUT THEY LIVE IN QUITE A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT AND YOU STILL HAVE TO BRIDGE THE GAP WITH THE SENSORY SYSTEMS
