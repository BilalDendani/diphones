StefanSagmeister_2009G I RUN A DESIGN STUDIO IN NEW YORK EVERY SEVEN YEARS I CLOSE IT FOR ONE YEAR TO PURSUE
StefanSagmeister_2009G SOME LITTLE EXPERIMENTS THINGS THAT ARE ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH DURING THE REGULAR WORKING YEAR IN THAT YEAR WE ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR ANY OF OUR CLIENTS
StefanSagmeister_2009G WE ARE TOTALLY CLOSED AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT IS A LOVELY AND VERY ENERGETIC TIME
StefanSagmeister_2009G I ORIGINALLY HAD OPENED THE STUDIO IN NEW YORK TO COMBINE MY TWO LOVES MUSIC AND DESIGN AND WE CREATED VIDEOS AND PACKAGING FOR MANY MUSICIANS THAT YOU KNOW AND FOR EVEN MORE THAT YOU'VE NEVER
StefanSagmeister_2009G AS I REALIZED JUST LIKE WITH MANY MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE THAT I ACTUALLY LOVE I ADAPT TO IT AND I GET
StefanSagmeister_2009G OVER TIME BORED BY THEM AND FOR SURE IN OUR CASE OUR WORK STARTED TO LOOK THE SAME YOU SEE HERE A GLASS EYE IN A DIE CUT OF A BOOK
StefanSagmeister_2009G TO CLOSE IT DOWN FOR ONE YEAR ALSO IS THE KNOWLEDGE THAT RIGHT NOW WE SPEND ABOUT IN THE FIRST TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF OUR LIVES LEARNING
StefanSagmeister_2009G AND I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO BASICALLY CUT OFF FIVE OF THOSE RETIREMENT YEARS AND INTERSPERSE THEM IN BETWEEN THOSE WORKING YEARS
StefanSagmeister_2009G THAT'S CLEARLY ENJOYABLE FOR MYSELF BUT PROBABLY EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IS THAT THE WORK THAT COMES OUT OF
StefanSagmeister_2009G BACK INTO THE COMPANY AND INTO SOCIETY AT LARGE RATHER THAN JUST BENEFITING A GRANDCHILD OR TWO
StefanSagmeister_2009G FELLOW TEDSTER WHO SPOKE TWO YEARS AGO JONATHAN HAIDT WHO
StefanSagmeister_2009G HIS WORK INTO THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS AND THEY RANG VERY TRUE FOR ME I CAN SEE MY WORK AS A JOB I DO IT FOR MONEY
StefanSagmeister_2009G I LIKELY ALREADY LOOK FORWARD TO THE WEEKEND ON THURSDAYS AND I PROBABLY WILL NEED A HOBBY AS A LEVELING MECHANISM
StefanSagmeister_2009G IN A CAREER I'M DEFINITELY MORE ENGAGED BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE WILL BE PERIODS WHEN I THINK IS ALL THAT REALLY HARD WORK REALLY
StefanSagmeister_2009G MY WHILE WHILE IN THE THIRD ONE IN THE CALLING VERY MUCH LIKELY I WOULD DO IT ALSO IF I WOULDN'T BE FINANCIALLY COMPENSATED FOR
StefanSagmeister_2009G NOT A RELIGIOUS PERSON MYSELF BUT I DID LOOK FOR NATURE I HAD SPENT MY FIRST SABBATICAL IN NEW YORK CITY LOOKED FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR THE SECOND ONE
StefanSagmeister_2009G SRI LANKA STILL HAD THE CIVIL WAR GOING ON SO BALI IT WAS IT'S A WONDERFUL VERY CRAFT ORIENTED SOCIETY
StefanSagmeister_2009G I ARRIVED THERE IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND PRETTY MUCH STARTED TO
StefanSagmeister_2009G COMING FROM THE AREA ITSELF HOWEVER THE FIRST THING THAT I NEEDED WAS MOSQUITO REPELLENT TYPOGRAPHY BECAUSE THEY WERE DEFINITELY AROUND HEAVILY
StefanSagmeister_2009G AND THEN I NEEDED SOME SORT OF WAY TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO ALL THE WILD DOGS THAT SURROUND MY HOUSE AND ATTACKED ME DURING MY MORNING WALKS SO WE CREATED THIS SERIES OF
StefanSagmeister_2009G NINETY NINE PORTRAITS ON TEE SHIRTS EVERY SINGLE DOG ON ONE TEE
StefanSagmeister_2009G AS A LITTLE RETALIATION WITH A JUST EVER SO SLIGHTLY MENACING
StefanSagmeister_2009G MESSAGE ON THE BACK OF
StefanSagmeister_2009G JUST BEFORE I LEFT NEW YORK I DECIDED I COULD ACTUALLY RENOVATE MY STUDIO AND THEN
StefanSagmeister_2009G JUST LEAVE IT ALL TO THEM AND I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING SO I LOOKED FOR FURNITURE AND IT TURNED OUT THAT
StefanSagmeister_2009G ALL THE FURNITURE THAT I REALLY LIKED I COULDN'T AFFORD AND ALL THE STUFF I COULD AFFORD I DIDN'T LIKE SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE PURSUED IN BALI WAS PIECES OF FURNITURE
StefanSagmeister_2009G THIS ONE OF COURSE STILL WORKS WITH THE WILD DOGS IT'S NOT QUITE FINISHED YET AND I THINK BY THE TIME THIS LAMP CAME ABOUT
StefanSagmeister_2009G FINALLY MADE PIECE WITH THOSE
StefanSagmeister_2009G THEN THERE IS A COFFEE TABLE I ALSO DID A COFFEE TABLE IT'S CALLED BE HERE NOW IT INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY
StefanSagmeister_2009G AND WE HAD CUSTOM ESPRESSO CUPS MADE THAT HIDE A MAGNET INSIDE AND MAKE THOSE COMPASSES GO CRAZY
StefanSagmeister_2009G ALWAYS CENTERING ON THEM THEN THIS IS A FAIRLY TALKATIVE VERBOSE KIND OF CHAIR
StefanSagmeister_2009G I ALSO START MEDITATING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE IN BALI AND AT THE SAME TIME I'M EXTREMELY AWARE HOW BORING IT IS TO HEAR ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE 'S HAPPINESSES SO I WILL NOT REALLY GO TOO FAR INTO IT
StefanSagmeister_2009G MANY OF YOU WILL KNOW THIS TEDSTER DANNY GILBERT WHOSE BOOK ACTUALLY I GOT IT THROUGH THE
StefanSagmeister_2009G I THINK IT TOOK ME FOUR YEARS TO FINALLY READ IT WHILE ON SABBATICAL AND I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT HE ACTUALLY WROTE THE BOOK WHILE HE WAS ON SABBATICAL
StefanSagmeister_2009G AND I'LL SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF PEOPLE THAT DID WELL BY PURSUING SABBATICALS THIS IS FERRAN ADRIA MANY PEOPLE THINK HE
StefanSagmeister_2009G RIGHT NOW THE BEST CHEF IN THE WORLD WITH HIS RESTAURANT NORTH OF BARCELONA ELBULLI HIS RESTAURANT IS OPEN SEVEN MONTHS EVERY YEAR HE CLOSES IT DOWN FOR FIVE MONTHS
StefanSagmeister_2009G TO EXPERIMENT WITH A FULL KITCHEN STAFF HIS LATEST NUMBERS ARE FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE HE
StefanSagmeister_2009G CAN SEAT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR HE CAN SEAT EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE AND HE HAS TWO POINT TWO MILLION REQUESTS FOR RESERVATIONS
StefanSagmeister_2009G IF I LOOK AT MY CYCLE SEVEN YEARS ONE YEAR SABBATICAL IT'S TWELVE POINT FIVE PERCENT OF MY TIME AND IF I LOOK AT COMPANIES THAT ARE ACTUALLY MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN MINE
StefanSagmeister_2009G THREE M SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES IS GIVING ALL THEIR ENGINEERS FIFTEEN PERCENT TO PURSUE WHATEVER THEY WANT
StefanSagmeister_2009G THERE IS SOME GOOD SUCCESSES SCOTCH TAPE CAME OUT OF THIS PROGRAM AS WELL AS ART FRY DEVELOPED STICKY NOTES FROM DURING HIS PERSONAL TIME FOR THREE M
StefanSagmeister_2009G OF COURSE VERY FAMOUSLY GIVES TWENTY PERCENT FOR THEIR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS TO PURSUE THEIR OWN PERSONAL PROJECTS ANYBODY IN HERE HAS ACTUALLY EVER CONDUCTED A SABBATICAL
StefanSagmeister_2009G THAT'S ABOUT FIVE PERCENT OF EVERYBODY SO
StefanSagmeister_2009G YOUR NEIGHBOR PUTTING THEIR HAND UP TALK TO THEM ABOUT IF IT WAS SUCCESSFUL OR NOT I'VE FOUND THAT
StefanSagmeister_2009G WHEN I HAD THE IDEA OF DOING ONE THE PROCESS WAS I MADE THE DECISION AND I PUT IT INTO MY DAILY PLANNER BOOK
StefanSagmeister_2009G AND THEN I TOLD AS MANY MANY PEOPLE AS I POSSIBLY COULD ABOUT IT SO THAT THERE WAS NO WAY THAT I COULD CHICKEN OUT LATER ON
StefanSagmeister_2009G IN THE BEGINNING ON THE FIRST SABBATICAL IT WAS RATHER DISASTROUS
StefanSagmeister_2009G I HAD THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD DO THIS WITHOUT ANY PLAN THAT THIS VACUUM OF TIME SOMEHOW
StefanSagmeister_2009G LITTLE REQUESTS NOT WORK REQUESTS THOSE I ALL SAID NO TO BUT OTHER LITTLE REQUESTS SENDING MAIL TO JAPANESE DESIGN MAGAZINES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO I BECAME MY OWN INTERN AND
StefanSagmeister_2009G I VERY QUICKLY
StefanSagmeister_2009G LIST OF THE THINGS I WAS INTERESTED IN PUT THEM IN A HIERARCHY DIVIDED THEM INTO CHUNKS OF TIME
StefanSagmeister_2009G AND THEN MADE A PLAN VERY MUCH LIKE IN GRADE SCHOOL WHAT DOES IT SAY HERE MONDAY EIGHT TO NINE STORY WRITING NINE TO TEN FUTURE THINKING
StefanSagmeister_2009G I REALLY GOT CLOSE TO DESIGN AGAIN I HAD FUN FINANCIALLY SEEN OVER THE LONG TERM IT WAS ACTUALLY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE OF THE IMPROVED QUALITY WE COULD ASK FOR HIGHER PRICES
StefanSagmeister_2009G AND PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY BASICALLY EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE IN THE SEVEN YEARS FOLLOWING THE FIRST SABBATICAL CAME OUT OF THINKING
StefanSagmeister_2009G OF THAT ONE SINGLE YEAR AND I'LL SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF PROJECTS THAT CAME OUT OF THE SEVEN YEARS FOLLOWING THAT SABBATICAL
StefanSagmeister_2009G ONE OF THE STRANDS OF THINKING I WAS INVOLVED IN WAS THAT SAMENESS IS SO INCREDIBLY OVERRATED
StefanSagmeister_2009G THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE EXACTLY THE SAME WORKS FOR A VERY VERY FEW STRAND OF COMPANIES AND NOT FOR EVERYBODY ELSE
StefanSagmeister_2009G ASKED TO DESIGN AN IDENTITY FOR CASA DE MUSICA THE REM KOOLHAAS BUILT
StefanSagmeister_2009G AND EVEN THOUGH I DESIRED TO DO AN IDENTITY THAT DOESN'T USE THE ARCHITECTURE I FAILED AT THAT AND MOSTLY ALSO BECAUSE I REALIZED
StefanSagmeister_2009G OUT OF A REM KOOLHAAS PRESENTATION TO THE CITY OF PORTO WHERE HE TALKED ABOUT A CONGLOMERATION OF VARIOUS LAYERS OF MEANING WHICH I UNDERSTOOD AFTER I TRANSLATED IT FROM ARCHITECTURE SPEECH IN TO REGULAR ENGLISH
StefanSagmeister_2009G AT IT DEEP DOWN IN THE GROUND CHECKED IT OUT FROM ALL SIDES WEST NORTH SOUTH EAST TOP AND BOTTOM
StefanSagmeister_2009G THEM IN A VERY PARTICULAR WAY BY HAVING A FRIEND OF MINE WRITE A PIECE OF SOFTWARE THE CASA DE MUSICA LOGO GENERATOR THAT'S CONNECTED TO A
StefanSagmeister_2009G SCANNER YOU PUT ANY IMAGE IN THERE LIKE THAT BEETHOVEN IMAGE AND THE SOFTWARE IN A SECOND WILL GIVE YOU THE CASA DE MUSICA BEETHOVEN LOGO
StefanSagmeister_2009G WHICH WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO DESIGN A BEETHOVEN POSTER COMES IN HANDY BECAUSE THE VISUAL INFORMATION OF THE LOGO AND
StefanSagmeister_2009G IT GETS ITS OWN LOGO OR PHILIP GLASS OR LOU REED OR THE CHEMICAL BROTHERS WHO ALL PERFORMED THERE GET THEIR OWN CASA DE MUSICA LOGO IT WORKS THE SAME INTERNALLY
StefanSagmeister_2009G THE PRESIDENT OR THE MUSICAL DIRECTOR WHOSE CASA DE MUSICA PORTRAITS WIND UP ON THEIR BUSINESS CARDS THERE IS A FULL BLOWN ORCHESTRA
StefanSagmeister_2009G LIVING INSIDE THE BUILDING IT HAS A MORE TRANSPARENT IDENTITY THE TRUCK THEY GO ON TOUR
StefanSagmeister_2009G A SMALLER CONTEMPORARY ORCHESTRA TWELVE PEOPLE THAT REMIXES ITS OWN TITLE
StefanSagmeister_2009G AND ONE OF THE HANDY THINGS THAT CAME ABOUT WAS THAT YOU COULD TAKE THE LOGO TYPE AND CREATE ADVERTISING OUT OF IT LIKE THIS DONNA TONEY POSTER OR CHOPIN OR MOZART OR LA MONTE YOUNG
StefanSagmeister_2009G YOU CAN TAKE THE SHAPE AND MAKE TYPOGRAPHY OUT OF IT YOU CAN GROW IT UNDERNEATH THE SKIN YOU CAN HAVE A POSTER FOR A FAMILY EVENT IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE
StefanSagmeister_2009G OR A RAVE UNDERNEATH THE HOUSE OR A WEEKLY PROGRAM AS WELL AS EDUCATIONAL SERVICES
StefanSagmeister_2009G SECOND INSIGHT SO FAR UNTIL THAT POINT I HAD BEEN MOSTLY INVOLVED OR USED THE LANGUAGE OF DESIGN FOR PROMOTIONAL PURPOSES WHICH WAS FINE WITH ME
StefanSagmeister_2009G ON ONE HAND I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST SELLING MY PARENTS ARE BOTH SALES PEOPLE BUT I DID FEEL THAT
StefanSagmeister_2009G I SPENT SO MUCH TIME LEARNING THIS LANGUAGE WHY DO I ONLY PROMOTE WITH IT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING ELSE AND THE WHOLE SERIES OF WORK CAME OUT OF IT
StefanSagmeister_2009G SOME OF YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT I SHOWED SOME OF IT AT EARLIER TEDS BEFORE UNDER THE TITLE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IN MY LIFE SO FAR I'LL JUST SHOW TWO NOW
StefanSagmeister_2009G THIS IS A WHOLE WALL OF BANANAS AT DIFFERENT RIPENESSES ON THE OPENING DAY IN THIS GALLERY IN NEW YORK IT SAYS SELF CONFIDENCE PRODUCES FINE RESULTS
StefanSagmeister_2009G THIS IS AFTER A WEEK AFTER TWO WEEKS THREE WEEKS FOUR WEEKS FIVE WEEKS AND YOU SEE THE SELF CONFIDENCE ALMOST COMES BACK BUT NOT QUITE
StefanSagmeister_2009G AND THEN THE CITY OF AMSTERDAM GAVE US A PLAZA AND ASKED US TO DO SOMETHING WE USED THE STONE PLATES AS A GRID FOR OUR LITTLE PIECE
StefanSagmeister_2009G GOT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND COINS FROM THE CENTRAL BANK AT DIFFERENT DARKNESSES SO WE GOT BRAND NEW ONES SHINY ONES MEDIUM ONES AND VERY OLD DARK ONES
StefanSagmeister_2009G AND WITH THE HELP OF ONE HUNDRED VOLUNTEERS OVER A WEEK CREATED THIS FAIRLY FLORAL TYPOGRAPHY
StefanSagmeister_2009G AS AN AUDIENCE YOU WOULD BE IN BETWEEN SHOULD I REALLY TAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS I CAN OR SHOULD I LEAVE THE PIECE INTACT AS IT IS RIGHT NOW
StefanSagmeister_2009G WHILE WE BUILT ALL THIS UP DURING THAT WEEK WITH THE HUNDRED VOLUNTEERS A GOOD NUMBER OF THE NEIGHBORS SURROUNDING THE PLAZA
StefanSagmeister_2009G CAME SAW AND THEY WANTED TO PROTECT THE ARTWORK AND THEY SWEPT IT ALL UP AND PUT IT INTO CUSTODY AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS
StefanSagmeister_2009G I THINK YOU SEE YOU SEE THEM SWEEPING YOU SEE THEM SWEEPING RIGHT HERE THAT'S THE POLICE GETTING RID OF IT ALL
StefanSagmeister_2009G SO AFTER EIGHT HOURS THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF THE WHOLE THING
StefanSagmeister_2009G WE ARE ALSO WORKING ON THE START OF A BIGGER PROJECT IN BALI IT'S A MOVIE ABOUT HAPPINESS AND HERE WE ASKED SOME NEARBY PIGS TO DO THE TITLES FOR US
StefanSagmeister_2009G THEY WEREN'T QUITE SLICK ENOUGH SO WE ASKED THE GOOSE TO DO IT AGAIN AND HOPED SHE WOULD DO SOMEHOW A MORE ELEGANT OR PRETTY JOB AND I THINK SHE OVERDID IT JUST A BIT TOO ORNAMENTAL
StefanSagmeister_2009G AND MY STUDIO IS VERY CLOSE TO THE MONKEY FOREST AND THE MONKEYS IN THAT MONKEY FOREST LOOKED ACTUALLY FAIRLY HAPPY SO WE ASKED THOSE GUYS TO DO IT AGAIN
StefanSagmeister_2009G DID A FINE JOB BUT HAD A COUPLE OF READABILITY PROBLEMS
StefanSagmeister_2009G OF COURSE WHATEVER YOU DON'T REALLY DO YOURSELF DOESN'T REALLY GET DONE PROPERLY
StefanSagmeister_2009G BE WORKING ON FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS SO IT'S GOING TO BE A WHILE AND OF COURSE YOU MIGHT THINK THAT
StefanSagmeister_2009G DOING A FILM ON HAPPINESS MIGHT NOT REALLY BE WORTHWHILE THEN YOU CAN OF COURSE ALWAYS GO AND SEE THIS GUY
