PhilZimbardo_2009U I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME IDEAS ABOUT THE SECRET POWER OF TIME IN A VERY SHORT TIME
PhilZimbardo_2009U RIGHT START THE CLOCK PLEASE
PhilZimbardo_2009U IT QUIET PLEASE
PhilZimbardo_2009U IT'S ABOUT TIME
PhilZimbardo_2009U EIGHT SEVEN
PhilZimbardo_2009U FIVE
PhilZimbardo_2009U LET 'S TUNE INTO THE CONVERSATION OF THE PRINCIPLES IN ADAM 'S TEMPTATION
PhilZimbardo_2009U COME ON ADAM DON'T BE SO WISHY WASHY TAKE A
PhilZimbardo_2009U ONE BITE ADAM DON'T ABANDON EVE I DON'T KNOW GUYS
PhilZimbardo_2009U GET IN TROUBLE OKAY ONE BITE WHAT THE HELL
PhilZimbardo_2009U LIFE IS TEMPTATION IT'S ALL ABOUT YIELDING RESISTING YES NO NOW LATER IMPULSIVE REFLECTIVE PRESENT FOCUS AND FUTURE FOCUS
PhilZimbardo_2009U WITHIN ONE YEAR AND MOST OF THEM DID SO WITHOUT USING BIRTH CONTROL SO MUCH FOR PROMISES NOW LETS TEMPT FOUR YEAR OLDS
PhilZimbardo_2009U MY COLLEAGUE AT STANFORD WENT BACK FOURTEEN YEARS LATER TO TRY TO DISCOVER WHAT WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE KIDS THERE WERE ENORMOUS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN KIDS WHO RESISTED AND KIDS WHO YIELDED IN MANY WAYS
PhilZimbardo_2009U THE KIDS WHO RESISTED SCORED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POINTS HIGHER ON THE SAT THAT'S ENORMOUS THAT'S LIKE A WHOLE SET OF DIFFERENT IQ POINTS
PhilZimbardo_2009U DIDN'T GET IN AS MUCH TROUBLE THEY WERE BETTER STUDENTS THEY WERE SELF CONFIDENT AND DETERMINED AND THE KEY FOR ME TODAY THE KEY FOR YOU IS THEY WERE FUTURE FOCUSED INSTEAD OF PRESENT
PhilZimbardo_2009U SO WHAT IS TIME PERSPECTIVE THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY TIME PERSPECTIVE IS THE STUDY OF HOW INDIVIDUALS ALL OF US DIVIDE THE FLOW OF YOUR HUMAN EXPERIENCE INTO TIME ZONES OR TIME CATEGORIES AND YOU DO IT AUTOMATICALLY AND NON CONSCIOUSLY
PhilZimbardo_2009U WHAT DETERMINES ANY DECISION YOU MAKE YOU MAKE A DECISION ON WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO BASE AN ACTION FOR SOME PEOPLE IT'S ONLY ABOUT WHAT IS IN THE IMMEDIATE SITUATION WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING AND WHAT YOU'RE FEELING
PhilZimbardo_2009U AND THOSE PEOPLE WHEN THEY MAKE THEIR DECISIONS IN THAT FORMAT WE'RE GOING TO CALL THEM PRESENT ORIENTED BECAUSE THEIR FOCUS IS WHAT IS NOW FOR OTHERS
PhilZimbardo_2009U THE PRESENT IS IRRELEVANT IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT WHAT IS THIS SITUATION LIKE THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST SO THAT THEIR DECISIONS ARE BASED ON PAST MEMORIES
PhilZimbardo_2009U IS SOMETHING THAT INFLUENCES EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE YOU'RE TOTALLY UNAWARE OF NAMELY THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE BIASED TIME
PhilZimbardo_2009U OR PAST NEGATIVE YOU CAN BE PRESENT HEDONISTIC NAMELY YOU FOCUS ON THE JOYS OF LIFE OR PRESENT FATALIST IT DOESN'T MATTER YOUR LIFE IS CONTROLLED YOU CAN BE FUTURE ORIENTED SETTING GOALS OR YOU CAN BE TRANSCENDENTAL FUTURE NAMELY LIFE BEGINS AFTER DEATH
PhilZimbardo_2009U SO VERY QUICKLY WHAT IS THE OPTIMAL TIME PROFILE HIGH ON PAST POSITIVE MODERATELY HIGH ON FUTURE AND MODERATE ON PRESENT HEDONISM
PhilZimbardo_2009U IS THE ENERGY THE ENERGY TO EXPLORE YOURSELF PLACES PEOPLE SENSUALITY
PhilZimbardo_2009U THEY SACRIFICE HOBBIES AND THEY SACRIFICE SLEEP SO IT AFFECTS THEIR HEALTH AND THEY LIVE FOR WORK ACHIEVEMENT AND CONTROL I'M SURE THAT RESONATES WITH SOME OF THE TEDSTERS
PhilZimbardo_2009U AND IT RESONATED FOR ME I GREW UP AS A POOR KID IN THE SOUTH BRONX GHETTO OF SICILIAN FAMILY EVERYONE LIVED IN THE PAST AND PRESENT I'M HERE AS A FUTURE ORIENTED PERSON WHO WENT OVER THE TOP WHO DID ALL THESE SACRIFICES BECAUSE
PhilZimbardo_2009U TEACHERS INTERVENED AND MADE ME FUTURE ORIENTED TOLD ME DON'T EAT THAT MARSHMALLOW BECAUSE IF YOU WAIT YOU'RE GOING TO GET TWO OF THEM UNTIL I LEARNED TO BALANCE OUT I'VE ADDED PRESENT HEDONISM I'VE ADDED
PhilZimbardo_2009U A FOCUS ON THE PAST POSITIVE SO AT SEVENTY SIX YEARS OLD I AM MORE ENERGETIC THAN EVER MORE PRODUCTIVE AND I'M HAPPIER THAN I HAVE EVER
PhilZimbardo_2009U I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE ARE APPLYING THIS TO MANY WORLD PROBLEMS CHANGING THE DROP OUT RATES OF SCHOOL KIDS COMBATING ADDICTIONS ENHANCING TEEN HEALTH
