MitchellJoachim_2010 GROW HOMES BECAUSE WE CAN RIGHT NOW AMERICA IS IN AN UNREMITTING STATE OF TRAUMA AND THERE'S A CAUSE FOR THAT ALL RIGHT WE'VE GOT
MitchellJoachim_2010 MCHOUSES AS AN ARCHITECT I HAVE TO CONFRONT SOMETHING LIKE THIS SO WHAT'S A TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL ALLOW US TO MAKE GINORMOUS HOUSES
MitchellJoachim_2010 WELL IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS IT'S CALLED PLEACHING OR GRAFTING TREES TOGETHER OR GRAFTING INOSCULATE MATTER INTO ONE CONTIGUOUS VASCULAR SYSTEM
MitchellJoachim_2010 AND WE DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE DID IN THE PAST WE ADD KIND OF A MODICUM OF INTELLIGENCE TO THAT WE USE CNC TO MAKE SCAFFOLDING TO TRAIN SEMI EPITHETIC MATTER PLANTS INTO A SPECIFIC GEOMETRY
MitchellJoachim_2010 THAT MAKES A HOME THAT WE CALL A FAB TREE HAB IT FITS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT IT IS THE ENVIRONMENT IT IS THE LANDSCAPE RIGHT AND YOU CAN HAVE A HUNDRED MILLION OF THESE HOMES AND IT'S GREAT
MitchellJoachim_2010 BECAUSE THEY SUCK CARBON THEY'RE PERFECT YOU CAN HAVE ONE HUNDRED MILLION FAMILIES OR TAKE THINGS OUT OF THE SUBURBS BECAUSE THESE ARE HOMES THAT ARE A PART OF THE ENVIRONMENT IMAGINE PRE GROWING A VILLAGE
MitchellJoachim_2010 TAKES ABOUT SEVEN TO TEN YEARS AND EVERYTHING IS GREEN SO NOT ONLY DO WE DO THE VEGGIE HOUSE WE ALSO
MitchellJoachim_2010 THE IN VITRO MEAT HABITAT OR HOMES THAT WE'RE DOING RESEARCH ON NOW IN BROOKLYN WHERE AS AN ARCHITECTURE OFFICE FOR THE FIRST OF ITS KIND TO PUT IN A MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY LAB
MitchellJoachim_2010 AND WHAT WE DO IS WE GROW EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX FROM PIGS WE USE A MODIFIED INKJET PRINTER AND WE PRINT GEOMETRY WE PRINT GEOMETRY WHERE WE CAN MAKE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN OBJECTS LIKE YOU KNOW SHOES LEATHER BELTS HANDBAGS ETC
MitchellJoachim_2010 WHERE NO SENTIENT CREATURE IS HARMED IT'S VICTIMLESS IT'S MEAT FROM A TEST TUBE SO OUR THEORY IS THAT EVENTUALLY WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS WITH HOMES
MitchellJoachim_2010 SO HERE IS A TYPICAL STUD WALL AN ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRUCTION AND THIS IS A SECTION OF OUR PROPOSAL FOR A MEAT HOUSE WHERE YOU CAN SEE WE USE
MitchellJoachim_2010 FATTY CELLS AS INSULATION CILIA FOR DEALING WITH WIND LOADS AND SPHINCTER MUSCLES FOR THE DOORS AND WINDOWS
MitchellJoachim_2010 AND WE DECIDED TO PUT IT IN FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL SO RELIGION CAN CONFRONT THE HOUSE OF MEAT THAT'S WHY WE GROW HOMES THANKS VERY MUCH
