HansRosling_2010X@15.97:20.18 WE ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE UNITED NATIONS
HansRosling_2010X@22.08:31.12 GOALS FOR THE PROGRESS OF COUNTRIES THEY'RE CALLED MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND THE REASON I REALLY LIKE THESE GOALS IS THAT THERE ARE EIGHT
HansRosling_2010X@32.21:40.61 AND BY SPECIFYING EIGHT DIFFERENT GOALS THE UNITED NATIONS HAS SAID THAT THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS NEEDED TO CHANGE IN
HansRosling_2010X@40.99:49.99 IN ORDER TO GET THE GOOD LIFE FOR PEOPLE LOOK HERE YOU HAVE TO END POVERTY EDUCATION GENDER CHILD AND MATERNAL HEALTH CONTROL INFECTIONS
HansRosling_2010X@50.55:57.77 PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND GET THE GOOD GLOBAL LINKS BETWEEN NATIONS IN EVERY ASPECT FROM AID TO TRADE
HansRosling_2010X@58.71:66.80 A SECOND REASON I LIKE THESE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND THAT IS BECAUSE EACH AND EVERY ONE IS MEASURED TAKE CHILD MORTALITY
HansRosling_2010X@79.06:82.34 AND THIS WITH MEASURING THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
HansRosling_2010X@90.25:98.03 WHAT I'M SO HAPPY ABOUT WITH THIS IS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY DOCUMENTED THAT THERE ARE MANY COUNTRIES IN ASIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
HansRosling_2010X@98.23:110.06 IN LATIN AMERICA AND EAST EUROPE THAT REDUCING WITH THIS RATE AND EVEN MIGHTY BRAZIL IS GOING DOWN WITH FIVE PERCENT PER YEAR AND TURKEY WITH SEVEN PERCENT PER YEAR SO THERE'S GOOD NEWS BUT THEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAYING
HansRosling_2010X@110.40:112.16 THERE IS NO PROGRESS IN AFRICA
HansRosling_2010X@113.11:118.29 AND THERE'S NOT EVEN STATISTICS ON AFRICA TO KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING I'LL PROVE THEM WRONG ON BOTH
HansRosling_2010X@119.71:128.03 COME WITH ME TO THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF STATISTICS I BRING YOU TO THE WEBPAGE CHILDMORTALITY ORG WHERE YOU CAN TAKE DEATHS IN CHILDREN
HansRosling_2010X@128.29:142.49 BELOW FIVE YEARS OF AGE FOR ALL COUNTRIES IT'S DONE BY U N SPECIALISTS AND I WILL TAKE KENYA AS AN EXAMPLE HERE YOU SEE THE DATA DON'T PANIC DON'T PANIC NOW I'LL HELP YOU THROUGH THIS IT LOOKS NASTY LIKE IN COLLEGE WHEN YOU DIDN'T LIKE
HansRosling_2010X@143.87:148.16 BUT FIRST THING WHEN YOU SEE DOTS LIKE THIS YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF FROM WHERE DO THE
HansRosling_2010X@149.68:161.62 WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THE DATA IS IT SO THAT IN KENYA THERE ARE DOCTORS AND OTHER SPECIALISTS WHO WRITE THE DEATH CERTIFICATE AT THE DEATH OF THE CHILD AND IT'S SENT TO THE STATISTICAL OFFICE NO LOW INCOME
HansRosling_2010X@175.75:189.53 IS NOT AN INCOMPLETE SYSTEM WE HAVE INTERVIEWS WE HAVE SURVEYS AND THIS IS HIGHLY PROFESSIONAL FEMALE INTERVIEWERS WHO SIT DOWN FOR ONE HOUR WITH A WOMAN AND ASK HER ABOUT BIRTH HISTORY HOW MANY CHILDREN DID YOU HAVE
HansRosling_2010X@190.40:193.66 THEY ALIVE IF THEY DIED AT WHAT AGE AND WHAT YEAR
HansRosling_2010X@194.34:198.60 AND THEN THIS IS DONE IN A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF THOUSANDS OF WOMEN IN THE
HansRosling_2010X@198.84:211.28 COUNTRY AND PUT TOGETHER IN WHAT USED TO BE CALLED A DEMOGRAPHIC HEALTH SURVEY REPORT BUT THESE SURVEYS ARE COSTLY SO THEY CAN ONLY BE DONE THREE TO FIVE YEAR INTERVALS BUT THEY HAVE GOOD QUALITY
HansRosling_2010X@211.78:224.30 SO THIS IS A LIMITATION AND ALL THESE COLORED LINES HERE ARE RESULTS EACH COLOR IS ONE SURVEY BUT THAT'S TOO COMPLICATED FOR TODAY SO I'LL SIMPLIFY IT FOR YOU AND I GIVE YOU ONE AVERAGE POINT FOR EACH SURVEY
HansRosling_2010X@233.02:243.54 AND WHEN THE EXPERTS IN THE U N HAVE GOT THESE SURVEYS IN PLACE IN THEIR DATABASE THEN THEY USE ADVANCED MATHEMATICAL FORMULAS TO PRODUCE A TREND LINE AND THE TREND LINE LOOKS LIKE THIS
HansRosling_2010X@245.04:251.74 THE BEST FIT THEY CAN GET OF THIS POINT BUT WATCH OUT THEY CONTINUE THE LINE BEYOND THE LAST POINT
HansRosling_2010X@252.99:253.85 INTO NOTHING
HansRosling_2010X@255.10:260.47 AND THEY ESTIMATED THAT TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT KENYA HAD PER CHILD MORTALITY OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY
HansRosling_2010X@262.42:271.03 BECAUSE WE COULD SEE THIS REVERSAL IN KENYA WITH AN INCREASED CHILD MORTALITY IN THE NINETIES IT WAS SO TRAGIC
HansRosling_2010X@271.77:281.10 IN JUNE I GOT A MAIL IN MY INBOX FROM DEMOGRAPHIC HEALTH SURVEYS AND IT SHOWED GOOD NEWS FROM KENYA I WAS SO HAPPY THIS WAS
HansRosling_2010X@281.77:284.13 THE NEW SURVEY THEN IT
HansRosling_2010X@288.67:292.34 WE GOT THE NEW TREND LINE IT
HansRosling_2010X@294.74:303.82 I WAS ACTUALLY ON FRIDAY SITTING IN FRONT OF MY COMPUTER AND I SAW THE DEATH RATE FALL FROM ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT TO EIGHTY FOUR JUST THAT MORNING SO WE CELEBRATED
HansRosling_2010X@318.96:332.40 THAT'S UNFAIR AS A PROFESSOR I THINK I HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROPOSE SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY I WOULD SAY AT LEAST DO THIS TEN YEARS IS ENOUGH TO FOLLOW THE TREND IT'S TWO SURVEYS AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW THEY HAVE TWO POINT FOUR PERCENT
HansRosling_2010X@333.16:342.91 HAD I BEEN IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH IN KENYA I MAY HAVE JOINED THESE TWO POINTS SO WHAT I'M TELLING YOU IS THAT WE KNOW THE CHILD MORTALITY WE HAVE A DECENT TREND
HansRosling_2010X@343.46:351.68 IT'S COMING INTO SOME TRICKY THINGS THEN WHEN WE ARE MEASURING MDGS AND THE REASON HERE FOR AFRICA IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE NINETIES WAS A
HansRosling_2010X@351.85:365.82 BAD DECADE NOT ONLY IN KENYA BUT ACROSS AFRICA THE HIV EPIDEMIC PEAKED THERE WAS RESISTANCE FOR THE OLD MALARIA DRUGS UNTIL WE GOT THE NEW DRUGS WE GOT LATER THE MOSQUITO NETTING AND THERE WAS SOCIO ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WHICH ARE NOW BEING SOLVED
HansRosling_2010X@366.04:375.97 AT A MUCH BETTER SCALE SO LOOK AT THE AVERAGE HERE THIS IS THE AVERAGE FOR ALL OF SUB SAHARAN AFRICA AND U N SAYS IT'S A REDUCTION WITH ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT
HansRosling_2010X@376.83:388.32 NOW THIS SOUNDS A LITTLE THEORETICAL BUT IT'S NOT SO THEORETICAL YOU KNOW THESE ECONOMISTS THEY LOVE MONEY THEY WANT MORE AND MORE OF IT THEY WANT IT TO GROW SO THEY CALCULATE THE PERCENT ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF ECONOMY
HansRosling_2010X@388.76:399.30 WE IN PUBLIC HEALTH WE HATE CHILD DEATH SO WE WANT LESS AND LESS AND LESS OF CHILD DEATHS SO WE CALCULATE THE PERCENT REDUCTION PER YEAR BUT IT'S SORT OF THE SAME PERCENTAGE IF YOUR ECONOMY GROWS WITH FOUR PERCENT
HansRosling_2010X@399.77:406.73 TO REDUCE CHILD MORTALITY FOUR PERCENT IF IT'S USED WELL AND PEOPLE ARE REALLY INVOLVED AND CAN GET THE USE OF THE RESOURCES IN THE WAY THEY
HansRosling_2010X@408.15:412.66 SO IS THIS FAIR NOW TO MEASURE THIS OVER NINETEEN YEARS AN ECONOMIST WOULD NEVER DO THAT
HansRosling_2010X@413.52:421.48 I HAVE JUST DIVIDED IT INTO TWO PERIODS IN THE NINETIES ONLY ONE POINT TWO PERCENT ONLY ONE POINT TWO PERCENT WHEREAS NOW
HansRosling_2010X@422.52:430.11 SECOND GEAR IT'S LIKE AFRICA HAD FIRST GEAR NOW THEY GO INTO SECOND GEAR BUT EVEN THIS IS NOT A FAIR REPRESENTATION OF AFRICA
HansRosling_2010X@430.35:437.98 BECAUSE IT'S AN AVERAGE IT'S AN AVERAGE SPEED OF REDUCTION IN AFRICA AND LOOK HERE WHEN I TAKE YOU INTO MY BUBBLE GRAPHS
HansRosling_2010X@438.57:443.52 HERE CHILD DEATH PER ONE THOUSAND ON THAT AXIS HERE WE HAVE
HansRosling_2010X@444.35:455.99 AND I'M NOW GIVING YOU A WIDER PICTURE THAN THE MDG I START FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN AFRICA CELEBRATED INDEPENDENCE IN MOST COUNTRIES I GIVE YOU CONGO WHICH WAS HIGH GHANA LOWER AND KENYA EVEN
HansRosling_2010X@456.69:465.11 AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS SINCE THEN HERE WE GO YOU CAN SEE WITH INDEPENDENCE LITERACY IMPROVED AND VACCINATIONS STARTED SMALLPOX WAS
HansRosling_2010X@466.39:474.13 HYGIENE WAS IMPROVED AND THINGS GOT BETTER BUT THEN IN THE EIGHTIES WATCH OUT HERE CONGO GOT INTO CIVIL WAR AND THEY LEVELED OFF HERE
HansRosling_2010X@474.52:484.73 GHANA GOT VERY AHEAD FAST THIS WAS THE BACKLASH IN KENYA AND GHANA BYPASSED BUT THEN KENYA AND GHANA GO DOWN TOGETHER STILL A STANDSTILL IN CONGO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TODAY
HansRosling_2010X@485.77:489.35 YOU CAN SEE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO MAKE AN AVERAGE OF
HansRosling_2010X@491.31:494.22 AND THIS VERY FAST IMPROVEMENT
HansRosling_2010X@495.79:507.60 TIME HAS COME TO STOP THINKING ABOUT SUB SAHARAN AFRICA AS ONE PLACE THEIR COUNTRIES ARE SO DIFFERENT AND THEY MERIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE SAME WAY AS WE DON'T
HansRosling_2010X@508.29:512.42 EUROPE AS ONE PLACE I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE ECONOMY IN GREECE AND SWEDEN ARE VERY DIFFERENT
HansRosling_2010X@513.36:518.21 EVERYONE KNOWS THAT AND THEY ARE JUDGED EACH COUNTRY ON HOW THEY ARE DOING SO
HansRosling_2010X@519.36:525.99 LET ME SHOW THE WIDER PICTURE MY COUNTRY SWEDEN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED WE WERE UP THERE
HansRosling_2010X@526.55:540.65 WHAT A STRANGE PERSONALITY DISORDER WE MUST HAVE COUNTING THE CHILDREN SO METICULOUSLY IN SPITE OF A HIGH CHILD DEATH RATE IT'S VERY STRANGE IT'S SORT OF EMBARRASSING BUT WE HAD THAT HABIT IN SWEDEN YOU KNOW THAT WE COUNTED ALL THE CHILD DEATHS EVEN IF WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT
HansRosling_2010X@541.88:548.05 AND THEN YOU SEE THESE WERE FAMINE YEARS THESE WERE BAD YEARS AND PEOPLE GOT FED UP WITH SWEDEN MY ANCESTORS MOVED TO THE UNITED STATES
HansRosling_2010X@548.39:557.37 AND EVENTUALLY SOON THEY STARTED TO GET BETTER AND BETTER HERE AND HERE WE GOT BETTER EDUCATION AND WE GOT HEALTH SERVICE AND CHILD MORTALITY CAME DOWN WE NEVER HAD
HansRosling_2010X@557.63:564.29 WAR SWEDEN WAS IN PEACE ALL THIS TIME BUT LOOK THE RATE OF LOWERING IN SWEDEN WAS NOT
HansRosling_2010X@565.99:571.81 SWEDEN ACHIEVED A LOW CHILD MORTALITY BECAUSE WE STARTED EARLY WE HAD
HansRosling_2010X@608.32:614.68 THEY WENT DOWN HERE AND REACHED ALMOST THE SAME CHILD MORTALITY LEVELS AS SWEDEN AND I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER STORY EGYPT
HansRosling_2010X@627.51:633.77 AND MALARIA AND A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND THEN THEY GOT THE ASWAN DAM THEY GOT ELECTRICITY IN THEIR HOMES THEY INCREASED
HansRosling_2010X@634.79:643.60 EDUCATION AND THEY GOT PRIMARY HEALTH CARE AND DOWN THEY WENT YOU KNOW AND THEY GOT SAFER WATER THEY ERADICATED MALARIA AND ISN'T IT A SUCCESS STORY
HansRosling_2010X@652.75:661.96 AS EGYPT DID AT ITS FASTEST KENYA IS NOW SPEEDING UP HERE WE HAVE A PROBLEM WE HAVE A SEVERE PROBLEM IN COUNTRIES WHICH ARE AT A STANDSTILL
HansRosling_2010X@663.01:669.64 NOW LET ME NOW BRING YOU TO A WIDER PICTURE A WIDER PICTURE OF CHILD MORTALITY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
HansRosling_2010X@690.95:698.73 THE COLOR YOU CAN SEE A CONTINENT THE DARK BLUE HERE IS SUB SAHARAN AFRICA AND THE SIZE OF THE BUBBLE IS THE POPULATION
HansRosling_2010X@699.26:708.53 AND THESE ARE THE SO CALLED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES THEY HAD HIGH OR VERY HIGH CHILD MORTALITY AND FAMILY SIZE SIX TO EIGHT
HansRosling_2010X@709.36:716.34 AND THE ONES OVER THERE THEY WERE SO CALLED WESTERN COUNTRIES THEY HAD LOW CHILD MORTALITY AND SMALL
HansRosling_2010X@728.89:736.20 I JUST WANT NOT TO HAVE ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT YOU HAVE TO SEE THAT FOR YOURSELF THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED NOW I START THE WORLD HERE WE COME DOWN
HansRosling_2010X@737.82:744.24 OF SMALLPOX BETTER EDUCATION HEALTH SERVICE IT GOT DOWN THERE CHINA COMES INTO THE WESTERN BOX
HansRosling_2010X@745.39:760.07 HERE BRAZIL IS IN THE WESTERN BOX INDIA IS APPROACHING THE FIRST AFRICAN COUNTRIES COMING INTO THE WESTERN BOX AND WE GET A LOT A NEW NEIGHBORS WELCOME TO A DECENT LIFE COME ON WE WANT EVERYONE DOWN THERE THIS IS THE VISION WE HAVE ISN'T IT AND LOOK NOW THE FIRST AFRICAN COUNTRIES HERE ARE COMING IN
HansRosling_2010X@760.39:770.00 THERE WE ARE TODAY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A WESTERN WORLD AND DEVELOPING WORLD THIS IS THE REPORT FROM U N
HansRosling_2010X@770.22:778.93 WHICH CAME OUT ON FRIDAY IT'S VERY GOOD LEVELS AND TRENDS IN CHILD MORTALITY EXCEPT THIS PAGE THIS PAGE IS VERY BAD
HansRosling_2010X@779.39:787.36 A CATEGORIZATION OF COUNTRIES IT LABELS DEVELOPING COUNTRIES I CAN READ FROM THE LIST HERE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES REPUBLIC OF KOREA SOUTH KOREA
HansRosling_2010X@789.78:798.29 THEY GET SAMSUNG HOW CAN THEY BE DEVELOPING COUNTRY THEY HAVE HERE SINGAPORE THEY HAVE THE LOWEST CHILD MORTALITY IN THE WORLD SINGAPORE THEY BYPASSED SWEDEN FIVE YEARS AGO
HansRosling_2010X@814.50:825.53 HAVE TO HAVE A MODERN CONCEPT WHICH FITS TO THE DATA AND WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT WE ARE ALL GOING TO INTO THIS DOWN TO HERE WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE NOW WITH THE RELATIONS HERE LOOK
HansRosling_2010X@826.18:838.08 EVEN IF WE LOOK IN AFRICA THESE ARE THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE RELATION WITH FALLING CHILD MORTALITY AND DECREASING FAMILY SIZE EVEN WITHIN AFRICA IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THIS IS WHAT
HansRosling_2010X@839.11:851.97 AND A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF RESEARCH CAME OUT ON FRIDAY FROM THE INSTITUTE OF HEALTH METRICS AND EVALUATION IN SEATTLE SHOWING THAT ALMOST FIFTY PERCENT OF THE FALL IN CHILD MORTALITY CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO FEMALE EDUCATION
HansRosling_2010X@853.13:866.08 THAT IS WHEN WE GET GIRLS IN SCHOOL WE'LL GET AN IMPACT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS LATER WHICH IS A SECULAR TREND WHICH IS VERY STRONG THAT'S WHY WE MUST HAVE THAT LONG TERM PERSPECTIVE BUT WE MUST MEASURE THE IMPACT OVER TEN
HansRosling_2010X@867.67:874.83 IT'S FULLY POSSIBLE TO GET CHILD MORTALITY DOWN IN ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES AND TO GET THEM DOWN IN THE CORNER WHERE WE ALL WOULD LIKE TO LIVE
HansRosling_2010X@878.97:887.89 LOWERING CHILD MORTALITY IS A MATTER OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE FROM HUMANITARIAN ASPECTS IT'S A DECENT LIFE FOR CHILDREN
HansRosling_2010X@888.05:896.21 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BUT IT IS ALSO A STRATEGIC INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE OF ALL MANKIND BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT
HansRosling_2010X@897.45:904.77 WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THE ENVIRONMENT AND AVOID THE TERRIBLE CLIMATE CRISIS IF WE DON'T STABILIZE THE WORLD POPULATION LET 'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT
HansRosling_2010X@905.34:917.74 AND THE WAY TO DO THAT THAT IS TO GET CHILD MORTALITY DOWN GET ACCESS TO FAMILY PLANNING AND BEHIND THAT DRIVE FEMALE EDUCATION AND THAT IS FULLY POSSIBLE LET 'S DO IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
