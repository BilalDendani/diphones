TracyChevalier_2012S I REALIZE I 'M NOT THINKING ABOUT THE PAINTINGS I 'M NOT CONNECTING TO THEM INSTEAD I 'M THINKING ABOUT THAT CUP OF COFFEE I DESPERATELY NEED TO WAKE ME UP
TracyChevalier_2012S I LOOK AT THE PAINTINGS ON THE WALL AND I THINK SOMEBODY HAS DECIDED TO PUT THEM THERE THINKS THEY 'RE GOOD ENOUGH
TracyChevalier_2012S TO BE ON THAT WALL BUT I DON 'T ALWAYS SEE IT IN FACT MOST OF THE TIME I DON 'T SEE IT
TracyChevalier_2012S AND I LEAVE FEELING ACTUALLY UNHAPPY I FEEL GUILTY AND UNHAPPY WITH MYSELF RATHER THAN THINKING THERE 'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE PAINTING I THINK THERE 'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME AND THAT 'S NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE TO LEAVE A GALLERY LIKE THAT
TracyChevalier_2012S WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MENU ARE YOU EXPECTED TO ORDER EVERY SINGLE THING ON THE MENU NO YOU SELECT IF YOU GO INTO A DEPARTMENT STORE TO BUY A SHIRT
TracyChevalier_2012S PINPOINT THE ONES THAT MAKE ME SLOW DOWN FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER I DON 'T EVEN KNOW WHY THEY MAKE ME SLOW DOWN BUT SOMETHING PULLS ME LIKE A MAGNET AND THEN I IGNORE ALL THE OTHERS AND I JUST GO TO THAT PAINTING SO IT 'S THE FIRST THING I DO IS I DO MY OWN CURATION I CHOOSE A PAINTING IT MIGHT JUST BE ONE PAINTING IN FIFTY
TracyChevalier_2012S AND THEN THE SECOND THING I DO IS I STAND IN FRONT OF THAT PAINTING AND I TELL MYSELF A STORY ABOUT IT
TracyChevalier_2012S WHY A STORY WELL I THINK THAT WE ARE WIRED OUR DNA TELLS US TO TELL STORIES WE TELL STORIES ALL THE TIME ABOUT EVERYTHING AND I THINK WE DO IT
TracyChevalier_2012S BECAUSE THE WORLD IS KIND OF A CRAZY CHAOTIC PLACE AND SOMETIMES STORIES WE 'RE TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THE WORLD A LITTLE BIT TRYING TO BRING SOME ORDER TO IT
TracyChevalier_2012S WHY NOT APPLY THAT TO OUR LOOKING AT PAINTINGS SO I NOW HAVE THIS SORT OF RESTAURANT MENU VISITING OF ART GALLERIES
TracyChevalier_2012S THERE ARE THREE PAINTINGS I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU NOW THAT ARE PAINTINGS THAT MADE ME STOP IN MY TRACKS AND WANT TO TELL STORIES ABOUT THEM
TracyChevalier_2012S I FIRST SAW IT WHEN I WAS NINETEEN AND I IMMEDIATELY WENT OUT AND GOT A POSTER OF IT AND IN FACT I STILL HAVE THAT POSTER THIRTY YEARS LATER IT 'S HANGING IN MY HOUSE
TracyChevalier_2012S IT 'S ACCOMPANIED ME EVERYWHERE I 'VE GONE I NEVER TIRE OF LOOKING AT HER WHAT MADE ME STOP IN MY TRACKS ABOUT HER TO BEGIN WITH WAS JUST THE GORGEOUS COLORS HE USES AND THE LIGHT FALLING ON HER FACE BUT I THINK WHAT 'S KEPT ME STILL COMING BACK YEAR AFTER YEAR IS ANOTHER THING AND THAT IS
TracyChevalier_2012S THE LOOK ON HER FACE THE CONFLICTED LOOK ON HER FACE I CAN 'T TELL IF SHE 'S HAPPY OR SAD AND I CHANGE MY MIND ALL THE TIME
TracyChevalier_2012S SO THAT KEEPS ME COMING BACK
TracyChevalier_2012S I LAY IN BED AND LOOKED AT HER
TracyChevalier_2012S AND I SUDDENLY THOUGHT I WONDER
TracyChevalier_2012S AND I THOUGHT WELL WHAT IS THAT RELATIONSHIP SO I WENT TO FIND OUT I DID SOME RESEARCH AND DISCOVERED WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO SHE IS IN FACT WE DON 'T KNOW WHO ANY OF THE MODELS IN ANY OF VERMEER 'S PAINTINGS ARE AND WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT VERMEER HIMSELF
TracyChevalier_2012S WHICH MADE ME GO YIPPEE I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT I CAN COME UP WITH WHATEVER STORY I WANT TO
TracyChevalier_2012S SO HERE 'S HOW I CAME UP WITH THE STORY
TracyChevalier_2012S FIRST OF ALL I THOUGHT I 'VE GOT TO GET HER INTO THE HOUSE HOW DOES VERMEER KNOW HER WELL THERE 'VE BEEN SUGGESTIONS THAT SHE IS HIS TWELVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER
TracyChevalier_2012S THE DAUGHTER AT THE TIME WAS TWELVE WHEN HE PAINTED THE PAINTING
TracyChevalier_2012S AND I THOUGHT NO IT 'S A VERY INTIMATE LOOK BUT IT 'S NOT A LOOK A DAUGHTER GIVES HER FATHER FOR ONE THING IN DUTCH PAINTING OF THE TIME IF A WOMAN 'S MOUTH WAS OPEN IT WAS INDICATING SEXUAL AVAILABILITY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INAPPROPRIATE FOR VERMEER TO PAINT HIS DAUGHTER LIKE THAT
TracyChevalier_2012S SO IT 'S NOT HIS DAUGHTER BUT IT 'S SOMEBODY CLOSE TO HIM PHYSICALLY CLOSE TO HIM WELL WHO ELSE WOULD BE IN THE HOUSE A SERVANT
TracyChevalier_2012S A LOVELY SERVANT SO SHE 'S IN THE HOUSE HOW DO WE GET HER INTO THE STUDIO
TracyChevalier_2012S WE DON 'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT VERMEER BUT THE LITTLE BITS THAT WE DO KNOW ONE THING WE KNOW IS THAT HE MARRIED A CATHOLIC WOMAN THEY LIVED WITH HER MOTHER IN A HOUSE WHERE HE HAD HIS OWN ROOM WHERE HE HIS STUDIO
TracyChevalier_2012S HE ALSO HAD ELEVEN CHILDREN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A CHAOTIC NOISY HOUSEHOLD
TracyChevalier_2012S AND IF YOU 'VE SEEN VERMEER 'S PAINTINGS BEFORE YOU KNOW THAT THEY 'RE INCREDIBLY CALM AND QUIET HOW DOES A PAINTER PAINT SUCH CALM QUIET PAINTINGS WITH ELEVEN KIDS AROUND WELL HE COMPARTMENTALIZES HIS LIFE
TracyChevalier_2012S HE GETS TO HIS STUDIO AND HE SAYS NOBODY COMES IN HERE NOT THE WIFE NOT THE KIDS OKAY THE MAID CAN COME IN AND CLEAN
TracyChevalier_2012S SHE 'S IN THE STUDIO HE 'S GOT HER IN THE STUDIO THEY 'RE TOGETHER AND HE DECIDES TO PAINT HER
TracyChevalier_2012S WE HAPPEN TO KNOW THERE 'S A LIST OF CATHARINA THE WIFE 'S CLOTHES AMONGST THEM A YELLOW COAT WITH WHITE FUR A YELLOW AND BLACK BODICE AND YOU SEE THESE CLOTHES ON LOTS OF OTHER PAINTINGS DIFFERENT WOMEN IN THE PAINTINGS VERMEER 'S PAINTINGS
TracyChevalier_2012S SO CLEARLY HER CLOTHES WERE LENT TO VARIOUS DIFFERENT WOMEN IT 'S NOT SUCH A LEAP OF FAITH TO TAKE THAT THAT PEARL EARRING ACTUALLY BELONGS TO HIS WIFE
TracyChevalier_2012S SO WE 'VE GOT ALL THE ELEMENTS FOR OUR STORY SHE 'S IN THE STUDIO WITH HIM FOR A LONG TIME THESE PAINTINGS TOOK A LONG TIME TO MAKE THEY WOULD HAVE SPENT THE TIME ALONE ALL THAT TIME SHE 'S WEARING HIS WIFE 'S PEARL EARRING SHE 'S GORGEOUS SHE OBVIOUSLY LOVES HIM SHE 'S CONFLICTED AND DOES THE WIFE KNOW MAYBE NOT AND IF SHE DOESN 'T
TracyChevalier_2012S WELL
TracyChevalier_2012S THAT 'S THE STORY
TracyChevalier_2012S HE 'S AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY FRENCH PAINTER BEST KNOWN FOR HIS STILL LIFES BUT HE DID OCCASIONALLY PAINT PEOPLE AND IN FACT HE PAINTED FOUR VERSIONS OF THIS PAINTING DIFFERENT BOYS BUILDING HOUSES OF CARDS ALL CONCENTRATED
TracyChevalier_2012S I LIKE THIS VERSION THE BEST BECAUSE SOME OF THE BOYS ARE OLDER
TracyChevalier_2012S AND SOME ARE YOUNGER AND TO ME THIS ONE LIKE GOLDILOCKS 'S PORRIDGE IS JUST RIGHT HE 'S NOT QUITE A CHILD AND HE 'S NOT QUITE A MAN HE 'S ABSOLUTELY BALANCED BETWEEN INNOCENCE AND EXPERIENCE AND THAT MADE ME STOP IN MY TRACKS IN FRONT OF THIS PAINTING
TracyChevalier_2012S AND I LOOKED AT HIS FACE IT 'S LIKE A VERMEER PAINTING A BIT THE LIGHT COMES IN FROM THE LEFT HIS FACE IS BATHED IN THIS GLOWING LIGHT IT 'S RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE PAINTING AND YOU LOOK AT IT AND I FOUND THAT WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT IT I WAS STANDING THERE GOING LOOK AT ME
TracyChevalier_2012S PLEASE LOOK AT ME AND HE DIDN 'T LOOK AT ME HE WAS STILL LOOKING AT HIS CARDS AND THAT 'S ONE OF THE SEDUCTIVE ELEMENTS OF THIS PAINTING IS HE 'S SO FOCUSED ON WHAT HE 'S DOING THAT HE DOESN 'T LOOK AT US
TracyChevalier_2012S AND THAT IS TO ME THE SIGN OF A MASTERPIECE OF A PAINTING WHEN THERE 'S A LACK OF RESOLUTION HE 'S NEVER GOING TO LOOK AT ME SO I WAS THINKING OF A STORY WHERE IF I 'M IN THIS POSITION WHO COULD BE THERE LOOKING AT HIM NOT THE PAINTER I DON 'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE PAINTER I 'M THINKING OF AN OLDER VERSION OF HIMSELF
TracyChevalier_2012S AND THAT LACK OF RESOLUTION THE LACK OF RESOLUTION IN GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING WE DON 'T KNOW IF SHE 'S HAPPY OR SAD I 'VE WRITTEN AN ENTIRE NOVEL ABOUT HER AND I STILL DON 'T KNOW IF SHE 'S HAPPY OR SAD
TracyChevalier_2012S AGAIN AND AGAIN BACK TO THE PAINTING LOOKING FOR THE ANSWER LOOKING FOR THE STORY TO FILL IN THAT GAP AND WE MAY MAKE A STORY AND IT SATISFIES US MOMENTARILY BUT NOT REALLY AND WE COME BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN
TracyChevalier_2012S THE LAST PAINTING I 'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS CALLED ANONYMOUS BY ANONYMOUS
TracyChevalier_2012S AND THEN THEY DISCOVERED THAT IT WASN 'T HIM AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHO IT IS NOW IN THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY IF YOU DON 'T KNOW THE BIOGRAPHY OF THE PAINTING IT 'S KIND OF USELESS TO YOU THEY CAN 'T HANG IT ON THE WALL BECAUSE THEY DON 'T KNOW WHO HE IS SO UNFORTUNATELY THIS ORPHAN
TracyChevalier_2012S SPENDS MOST OF HIS TIME IN STORAGE ALONG WITH QUITE A NUMBER OF OTHER ORPHANS SOME OF THEM SOME BEAUTIFUL PAINTINGS
TracyChevalier_2012S THIS PAINTING MADE ME STOP IN MY TRACKS FOR THREE REASONS ONE IS THE DISCONNECTION BETWEEN HIS MOUTH THAT 'S SMILING AND HIS EYES THAT ARE WISTFUL HE 'S NOT HAPPY AND WHY ISN 'T HE HAPPY
TracyChevalier_2012S THE SECOND THING THAT REALLY ATTRACTED ME WERE HIS BRIGHT RED CHEEKS HE IS BLUSHING HE 'S BLUSHING FOR HIS PORTRAIT BEING MADE THIS MUST BE A GUY WHO BLUSHES ALL THE TIME WHAT IS HE THINKING ABOUT THAT 'S MAKING HIM BLUSH
TracyChevalier_2012S THE THIRD THING THAT MADE ME STOP IN MY TRACKS IS HIS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS DOUBLET
TracyChevalier_2012S SILK GRAY THOSE BEAUTIFUL BUTTONS AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT MAKES ME THINK OF IS IT 'S SORT OF SNUG AND PUFFY IT 'S LIKE A DUVET SPREAD OVER A BED I KEPT THINKING OF BEDS AND RED CHEEKS AND OF COURSE I KEPT THINKING OF SEX WHEN I LOOKED AT HIM
TracyChevalier_2012S AND I THOUGHT IS THAT WHAT HE 'S THINKING ABOUT AND I THOUGHT IF I 'M GOING TO MAKE A STORY WHAT 'S THE LAST THING I 'M GOING TO PUT IN THERE WELL WHAT WOULD A TUDOR GENTLEMAN BE PREOCCUPIED WITH AND I THOUGHT WELL HENRY VIII OKAY HE 'D BE PREOCCUPIED WITH HIS INHERITANCE WITH HIS HEIR WHO IS GOING TO INHERIT
TracyChevalier_2012S HIS NAME AND HIS FORTUNE YOU PUT ALL THOSE TOGETHER AND YOU 'VE GOT YOUR STORY
TracyChevalier_2012S TO FILL IN THAT GAP THAT MAKES YOU KEEP COMING BACK NOW
TracyChevalier_2012S HERE 'S THE STORY
TracyChevalier_2012S I AM STILL WEARING THE WHITE BROCADE DOUBLET CAROLINE GAVE ME
TracyChevalier_2012S IT HAS A PLAIN HIGH COLLAR
TracyChevalier_2012S DETACHABLE SLEEVES AND INTRICATE BUTTONS OF TWISTED SILK THREAD SET CLOSE TOGETHER SO THAT THE FIT IS SNUG THE DOUBLET MAKES ME THINK OF A COVERLET ON THE VAST BED
TracyChevalier_2012S PERHAPS THAT WAS THE INTENTION I FIRST WORE IT AT AN ELABORATE DINNER HER PARENTS HELD IN OUR HONOR
TracyChevalier_2012S I KNEW EVEN BEFORE I STOOD UP TO SPEAK THAT MY CHEEKS WERE INFLAMED
TracyChevalier_2012S I HAVE ALWAYS FLUSHED EASILY FROM PHYSICAL EXERTION FROM WINE FROM HIGH EMOTION AS A BOY I WAS TEASED BY MY SISTERS AND BY SCHOOLBOYS BUT NOT BY GEORGE ONLY GEORGE COULD CALL ME ROSY I WOULD NOT ALLOW ANYONE ELSE
TracyChevalier_2012S HE MANAGED TO MAKE THE WORD TENDER WHEN I MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT GEORGE DID NOT TURN ROSY BUT WENT PALE AS MY DOUBLET HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IT HAS BEEN A COMMON ASSUMPTION THAT I WOULD ONE DAY MARRY HIS COUSIN
TracyChevalier_2012S BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO HEAR THE WORDS ALOUD I KNOW I COULD BARELY UTTER THEM
TracyChevalier_2012S AFTERWARDS I FOUND GEORGE ON THE TERRACE OVERLOOKING THE KITCHEN GARDEN DESPITE DRINKING STEADILY ALL AFTERNOON HE WAS STILL PALE WE STOOD TOGETHER AND WATCHED THE MAIDS CUT LETTUCES
TracyChevalier_2012S WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY DOUBLET I ASKED
TracyChevalier_2012S HE GLANCED AT ME THAT COLLAR LOOKS TO BE STRANGLING YOU
TracyChevalier_2012S WE WILL STILL SEE EACH OTHER I INSISTED WE CAN STILL HUNT AND PLAY CARDS AND ATTEND COURT NOTHING NEED CHANGE
TracyChevalier_2012S GEORGE DRAINED ANOTHER GLASS OF CLARET AND TURNED TO ME CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR UPCOMING NUPTIALS JAMES I 'M SURE YOU 'LL BE
TracyChevalier_2012S CONTENT TOGETHER
TracyChevalier_2012S HE NEVER USED MY NICKNAME AGAIN
