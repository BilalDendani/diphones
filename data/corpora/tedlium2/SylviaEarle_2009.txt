SylviaEarle_2009@40.99:50.07 BUT NOW WE KNOW AND NOW WE ARE FACING PARADISE LOST I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU MY PERSONAL VIEW OF CHANGES IN THE SEA THAT AFFECT ALL OF US
SylviaEarle_2009@80.04:88.81 THE THOUGHT OF WHAT RAY ANDERSON CALLS TOMORROW 'S CHILD ASKING WHY WE DIDN'T DO SOMETHING ON OUR WATCH TO SAVE
SylviaEarle_2009@96.17:107.73 WELL NOW IS THAT TIME I HOPE FOR YOUR HELP TO EXPLORE AND PROTECT THE WILD OCEAN IN WAYS THAT WILL RESTORE THE HEALTH AND IN SO DOING
SylviaEarle_2009@128.85:133.21 THAT SOMEDAY WE WILL FIND EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS
SylviaEarle_2009@137.87:138.22 SAY THAT
SylviaEarle_2009@144.50:147.15 ME AS A SCIENTIST IT ALL BEGAN
SylviaEarle_2009@149.88:164.18 WHEN I FIRST TRIED SCUBA IT'S WHEN I FIRST GOT TO KNOW FISH SWIMMING IN SOMETHING OTHER THAN LEMON SLICES AND BUTTER I ACTUALLY LOVE DIVING AT NIGHT YOU SEE A LOT OF FISH THEN THAT YOU DON'T SEE IN THE DAYTIME
SylviaEarle_2009@175.95:177.47 THAT ASTRONAUTS WERE
SylviaEarle_2009@196.26:207.56 THEN I'VE USED ABOUT THIRTY KINDS OF SUBMARINES AND I'VE STARTED THREE COMPANIES AND A NONPROFIT FOUNDATION CALLED DEEP SEARCH TO DESIGN AND BUILD SYSTEMS TO ACCESS THE DEEP SEA
SylviaEarle_2009@207.96:217.91 I LED A FIVE YEAR NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC EXPEDITION THE SUSTAINABLE SEAS EXPEDITIONS USING THESE LITTLE SUBS THEY'RE SO SIMPLE TO DRIVE THAT EVEN A SCIENTIST CAN DO IT
SylviaEarle_2009@228.44:237.32 THE THINGS YOU NEED TO STAY ALIVE IN SPACE OR UNDER THE SEA I HEARD ASTRONAUT JOE ALLEN EXPLAIN HOW HE HAD TO LEARN EVERYTHING HE COULD ABOUT
SylviaEarle_2009@237.43:243.87 HIS LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM AND THEN DO EVERYTHING HE COULD TO TAKE CARE OF HIS LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM
SylviaEarle_2009@247.44:254.89 LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM WE NEED TO LEARN EVERYTHING WE CAN ABOUT IT AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO TAKE CARE OF IT
SylviaEarle_2009@255.46:261.82 THE POET AUDEN SAID THOUSANDS HAVE LIVED WITHOUT LOVE NONE WITHOUT WATER
SylviaEarle_2009@272.58:280.63 MARS COMES TO MIND NO OCEAN NO LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM I GAVE A TALK NOT SO LONG AGO AT THE WORLD BANK
SylviaEarle_2009@281.21:289.67 AND I SHOWED THIS AMAZING IMAGE OF EARTH AND I SAID THERE IT IS THE WORLD BANK THAT'S WHERE ALL THE ASSETS ARE
SylviaEarle_2009@292.56:304.33 WE'VE BEEN TRAWLING THEM DOWN MUCH FASTER THAN THE NATURAL SYSTEMS CAN REPLENISH THEM TIM WORTH SAYS THE ECONOMY IS A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE ENVIRONMENT WITH EVERY DROP OF WATER YOU DRINK EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE
SylviaEarle_2009@305.39:319.26 YOU'RE CONNECTED TO THE SEA NO MATTER WHERE ON EARTH YOU LIVE MOST OF THE OXYGEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE IS GENERATED BY THE SEA OVER TIME MOST OF THE PLANET 'S ORGANIC CARBON HAS BEEN ABSORBED AND STORED THERE MOSTLY BY MICROBES
SylviaEarle_2009@319.99:331.65 THE OCEAN DRIVES CLIMATE AND WEATHER STABILIZES TEMPERATURE SHAPES EARTH 'S CHEMISTRY WATER FROM THE SEA FORMS CLOUDS THAT RETURN TO THE LAND AND THE SEAS AS RAIN SLEET AND SNOW
SylviaEarle_2009@332.19:342.06 AND PROVIDES HOME FOR ABOUT NINETY SEVEN PERCENT OF LIFE IN THE WORLD MAYBE IN THE UNIVERSE NO WATER NO LIFE NO BLUE NO GREEN
SylviaEarle_2009@343.30:346.54 YET WE HAVE THIS IDEA WE HUMANS THAT THE EARTH
SylviaEarle_2009@358.17:367.64 BUT IN THE LAST ONE HUNDRED ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST FIFTY WE'VE DRAWN DOWN THE ASSETS THE AIR THE WATER THE WILDLIFE THAT MAKE OUR LIVES POSSIBLE
SylviaEarle_2009@368.35:376.69 NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE HELPING US TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF NATURE THE NATURE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING
SylviaEarle_2009@377.40:389.89 SHOWING US OUR IMPACT ON THE EARTH I MEAN FIRST YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM AND FORTUNATELY IN OUR TIME WE'VE LEARNED MORE ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THAN IN ALL PRECEDING HISTORY
SylviaEarle_2009@390.46:401.71 AND WITH KNOWING COMES CARING AND WITH CARING THERE'S HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND AN ENDURING PLACE FOR OURSELVES WITHIN THE NATURAL SYSTEMS THAT SUPPORT US BUT FIRST WE HAVE TO KNOW
SylviaEarle_2009@404.32:413.61 THREE YEARS AGO I MET JOHN HANKE WHO 'S THE HEAD OF GOOGLE EARTH AND I TOLD HIM HOW MUCH I LOVED BEING ABLE TO HOLD THE WORLD IN MY HANDS AND GO EXPLORING VICARIOUSLY
SylviaEarle_2009@414.50:420.93 I ASKED HIM WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO FINISH IT YOU DID A GREAT JOB WITH THE LAND THE DIRT WHAT ABOUT THE WATER
SylviaEarle_2009@422.83:432.91 SINCE THEN I'VE HAD THE GREAT PLEASURE OF WORKING WITH THE GOOGLERS WITH DOER MARINE WITH NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC WITH DOZENS OF THE BEST INSTITUTIONS AND SCIENTISTS
SylviaEarle_2009@433.20:443.05 AROUND THE WORLD ONES THAT WE COULD ENLIST TO PUT THE OCEAN IN GOOGLE EARTH AND AS OF JUST THIS WEEK LAST MONDAY GOOGLE EARTH IS NOW WHOLE
SylviaEarle_2009@444.30:458.05 CONSIDER THIS STARTING RIGHT HERE AT THE CONVENTION CENTER WE CAN FIND THE NEARBY AQUARIUM WE CAN LOOK AT WHERE WE'RE SITTING AND THEN WE CAN CRUISE UP THE COAST TO THE BIG AQUARIUM THE OCEAN AND CALIFORNIA 'S FOUR NATIONAL MARINE
SylviaEarle_2009@458.61:465.48 THE NEW NETWORK OF STATE MARINE RESERVES THAT ARE BEGINNING TO PROTECT AND RESTORE SOME OF THE ASSETS
SylviaEarle_2009@465.77:473.20 WE CAN FLIT OVER TO HAWAII AND SEE THE REAL HAWAIIAN ISLANDS NOT JUST THE LITTLE BIT THAT POKES THROUGH THE SURFACE
SylviaEarle_2009@473.83:481.64 BUT ALSO WHAT'S BELOW TO SEE WAIT A MINUTE WE CAN GO KSHHPLASH RIGHT THERE
SylviaEarle_2009@493.24:502.02 CAN GO ACTUALLY AND SWIM AROUND ON GOOGLE EARTH AND VISIT WITH HUMPBACK WHALES THESE ARE GENTLE GIANTS
SylviaEarle_2009@502.27:510.35 THAT I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING FACE TO FACE MANY TIMES UNDERWATER THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE BEING PERSONALLY INSPECTED BY A WHALE
SylviaEarle_2009@511.99:525.62 WE CAN PICK UP AND FLY TO THE DEEPEST PLACE SEVEN MILES DOWN THE MARIANA TRENCH WHERE ONLY TWO PEOPLE HAVE EVER BEEN IMAGINE THAT IT'S ONLY SEVEN MILES BUT ONLY TWO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THERE FORTY NINE YEARS AGO
SylviaEarle_2009@526.15:540.58 ONE WAY TRIPS ARE EASY WE NEED NEW DEEP DIVING SUBMARINES HOW ABOUT SOME X PRIZES FOR OCEAN EXPLORATION WE NEED TO SEE DEEP TRENCHES THE UNDERSEA MOUNTAINS AND UNDERSTAND LIFE IN THE DEEP SEA
SylviaEarle_2009@555.70:567.93 BAD NEWS FOR THE POLAR BEARS THAT'S BAD NEWS FOR US TOO EXCESS CARBON DIOXIDE IS NOT ONLY DRIVING GLOBAL WARMING IT'S ALSO CHANGING OCEAN CHEMISTRY MAKING THE SEA MORE ACIDIC
SylviaEarle_2009@568.57:575.46 BAD NEWS FOR CORAL REEFS AND OXYGEN PRODUCING PLANKTON ALSO BAD NEWS FOR US WE'RE PUTTING
SylviaEarle_2009@576.07:583.04 HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TONS OF PLASTIC AND OTHER TRASH INTO THE SEA MILLIONS OF TONS OF DISCARDED FISHING NETS
SylviaEarle_2009@583.77:590.62 GEAR THAT CONTINUES TO KILL WE'RE CLOGGING THE OCEAN POISONING THE PLANET 'S CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
SylviaEarle_2009@600.34:612.11 WE'RE KILLING SHARKS FOR SHARK FIN SOUP UNDERMINING FOOD CHAINS THAT SHAPE PLANETARY CHEMISTRY AND DRIVE THE CARBON CYCLE THE NITROGEN CYCLE THE OXYGEN CYCLE THE WATER CYCLE
SylviaEarle_2009@624.18:636.02 OF THESE PARTS ARE PART OF OUR LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM WE KILL USING LONG LINES WITH BAITED HOOKS EVERY FEW FEET THAT MAY STRETCH FOR FIFTY MILES OR MORE
SylviaEarle_2009@650.92:661.06 SHAKING THE FOUNDATION OF OUR LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM LEAVING PLUMES OF DEATH IN THEIR PATH THE NEXT TIME YOU DINE ON SUSHI OR SASHIMI OR SWORDFISH STEAK OR SHRIMP COCKTAIL
SylviaEarle_2009@669.68:679.61 MORE THAN TEN POUNDS EVEN ONE HUNDRED POUNDS MAY BE THROWN AWAY AS BYCATCH THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF NOT KNOWING
SylviaEarle_2009@689.00:701.74 TO TWO THOUSAND THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS ARE IN RED IN MY LIFETIME IMAGINE NINETY PERCENT OF THE BIG FISH HAVE BEEN KILLED MOST OF THE TURTLES SHARKS TUNAS AND WHALES
SylviaEarle_2009@702.33:713.65 ARE WAY DOWN IN NUMBERS BUT THERE IS GOOD NEWS TEN PERCENT OF THE BIG FISH STILL REMAIN THERE ARE STILL SOME BLUE WHALES THERE ARE STILL SOME KRILL IN ANTARCTICA
SylviaEarle_2009@722.93:726.73 STILL TIME BUT NOT A LOT TO TURN THINGS AROUND
SylviaEarle_2009@727.61:736.11 BUSINESS AS USUAL MEANS THAT IN FIFTY YEARS THERE MAY BE NO CORAL REEFS AND NO COMMERCIAL FISHING BECAUSE THE FISH WILL SIMPLY BE GONE
SylviaEarle_2009@736.91:744.11 IMAGINE THE OCEAN WITHOUT FISH IMAGINE WHAT THAT MEANS TO OUR LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM
SylviaEarle_2009@767.41:777.05 ABOUT TWELVE PERCENT OF THE LAND AROUND THE WORLD IS NOW PROTECTED SAFEGUARDING BIODIVERSITY PROVIDING A CARBON SINK GENERATING OXYGEN PROTECTING WATERSHEDS
SylviaEarle_2009@787.05:795.74 THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THERE ARE NOW MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND PLACES IN THE SEA AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAVE SOME KIND OF PROTECTION AND YOU CAN FIND THEM ON GOOGLE EARTH
SylviaEarle_2009@832.13:833.69 PROTECTED AREAS PROVIDE HOPE
SylviaEarle_2009@857.59:865.79 AND TRY TO FIND WAYS TO GIVE THEM AND US A SECURE FUTURE SUCH AS THE ARCTIC WE HAVE ONE CHANCE RIGHT NOW TO GET IT RIGHT
SylviaEarle_2009@866.79:879.95 OR THE ANTARCTIC WHERE THE CONTINENT IS PROTECTED BUT THE SURROUNDING OCEAN IS BEING STRIPPED OF ITS KRILL WHALES AND FISH SARGASSO SEA 'S THREE MILLION SQUARE MILES OF
SylviaEarle_2009@881.23:891.59 BEING GATHERED UP TO FEED COWS NINETY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE LAND IN THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS IS PROTECTED BUT THE ADJACENT SEA IS BEING RAVAGED BY FISHING
SylviaEarle_2009@892.01:900.90 IT'S TRUE TOO IN ARGENTINA ON THE PATAGONIAN SHELF NOW IN SERIOUS TROUBLE THE HIGH SEAS WHERE WHALES TUNA AND DOLPHINS TRAVEL
SylviaEarle_2009@902.25:914.03 THE LARGEST LEAST PROTECTED ECOSYSTEM ON EARTH FILLED WITH LUMINOUS CREATURES LIVING IN DARK WATERS THAT AVERAGE TWO MILES DEEP THEY FLASH AND SPARKLE AND GLOW
SylviaEarle_2009@917.59:920.68 STILL PLACES IN THE SEA AS PRISTINE AS I KNEW AS A CHILD
SylviaEarle_2009@921.80:928.63 THE NEXT TEN YEARS MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT AND THE NEXT TEN THOUSAND YEARS THE BEST CHANCE OUR SPECIES WILL HAVE TO PROTECT
SylviaEarle_2009@929.07:937.27 WHAT REMAINS OF THE NATURAL SYSTEMS THAT GIVE US LIFE TO COPE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE WE NEED NEW WAYS TO GENERATE POWER
SylviaEarle_2009@938.27:947.51 WE NEED NEW WAYS BETTER WAYS TO COPE WITH POVERTY WARS AND DISEASE WE NEED MANY THINGS TO KEEP AND MAINTAIN THE WORLD AS A BETTER PLACE
SylviaEarle_2009@948.76:949.67 NOTHING ELSE WILL MATTER
SylviaEarle_2009@950.80:957.25 IF WE FAIL TO PROTECT THE OCEAN OUR FATE AND THE OCEAN ARE ONE
SylviaEarle_2009@957.34:961.16 WE NEED TO DO FOR THE OCEAN WHAT AL GORE DID FOR THE SKIES ABOVE
SylviaEarle_2009@961.96:972.11 GLOBAL PLAN OF ACTION WITH A WORLD CONSERVATION UNION THE IUCN IS UNDERWAY TO PROTECT BIODIVERSITY TO MITIGATE AND RECOVER FROM THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
SylviaEarle_2009@972.98:980.32 ON THE HIGH SEAS AND IN COASTAL AREAS WHEREVER WE CAN IDENTIFY CRITICAL PLACES
SylviaEarle_2009@981.06:988.00 NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE NEEDED TO MAP PHOTOGRAPH AND EXPLORE THE NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE OCEAN THAT WE HAVE YET TO SEE
SylviaEarle_2009@988.60:992.84 THE GOAL IS TO PROTECT BIODIVERSITY TO PROVIDE STABILITY AND RESILIENCE
SylviaEarle_2009@993.60:1000.88 WE NEED DEEP DIVING SUBS NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO EXPLORE THE OCEAN WE NEED MAYBE AN EXPEDITION
SylviaEarle_2009@1001.68:1008.37 TED AT SEA THAT COULD HELP FIGURE OUT THE NEXT STEPS AND SO I SUPPOSE YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
SylviaEarle_2009@1011.00:1024.16 I WISH YOU WOULD USE ALL MEANS AT YOUR DISPOSAL FILMS EXPEDITIONS THE WEB NEW SUBMARINES A CAMPAIGN TO IGNITE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR A GLOBAL NETWORK OF MARINE PROTECTED AREAS
SylviaEarle_2009@1032.12:1038.46 MUCH SOME SAY TEN PERCENT SOME SAY THIRTY PERCENT YOU DECIDE HOW MUCH OF YOUR HEART
SylviaEarle_2009@1041.97:1046.37 WHATEVER IT IS A FRACTION OF ONE PERCENT IS NOT ENOUGH
SylviaEarle_2009@1047.94:1052.93 MY WISH IS A BIG WISH BUT IF WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN IT CAN TRULY CHANGE THE WORLD
SylviaEarle_2009@1064.56:1065.97 FOR THE CHILDREN OF TODAY
SylviaEarle_2009@1070.78:1071.29 IS THE TIME
