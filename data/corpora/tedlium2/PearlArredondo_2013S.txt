PearlArredondo_2013S I HAD AN AMAZING MOM WHO WAS JUST FIERCELY INDEPENDENT SHE WORKED AT THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL AS A SECRETARY IN THE DEAN 'S OFFICE SO SHE GOT TO
PearlArredondo_2013S SO SEE KIDS LIKE US WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO DEAL WITH OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL AND
PearlArredondo_2013S REALLY DO YOU THINK THAT DOING MY HOMEWORK THAT NIGHT WAS AT THE TOP OF MY PRIORITY LIST
PearlArredondo_2013S I NEEDED TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM EVERY DAY WHO WERE GOING TO SAY YOU CAN MOVE BEYOND THAT
PearlArredondo_2013S AND THEN I TOLD THEM I WANT TO BE A TEACHER AND BOY THEY WERE LIKE WHAT WHY WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT SO I BEGAN MY TEACHING CAREER AT THE EXACT SAME MIDDLE SCHOOL THAT I ATTENDED AND
PearlArredondo_2013S I REALLY WANTED TO TRY TO SAVE MORE KIDS WHO WERE JUST LIKE ME AND SO EVERY YEAR I SHARE MY BACKGROUND WITH MY KIDS BECAUSE THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT EVERYONE HAS A STORY EVERYONE HAS A STRUGGLE
PearlArredondo_2013S AND EVERYONE NEEDS HELP ALONG THE WAY AND I
PearlArredondo_2013S I CREATED
PearlArredondo_2013S OPPORTUNITY
PearlArredondo_2013S I HAD A KID ONE DAY COME INTO MY CLASS HAVING BEEN STABBED THE NIGHT BEFORE
PearlArredondo_2013S I NEED TO BE IN CLASS BECAUSE I NEED TO GRADUATE SO HE KNEW THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO LET HIM BE A VICTIM OF HIS CIRCUMSTANCE BUT WE WERE GOING TO PUSH FORWARD AND KEEP MOVING ON
PearlArredondo_2013S AND TEACHERS TURNING OVER YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR HOW DO YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
PearlArredondo_2013S SO WE CREATED A NEW SCHOOL
PearlArredondo_2013S AND WE CREATED THE SAN FERNANDO INSTITUTE FOR APPLIED MEDIA
PearlArredondo_2013S WE MADE SURE THAT WE WERE STILL
PearlArredondo_2013S ATTACHED TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR FUNDING FOR SUPPORT
PearlArredondo_2013S BUT WITH THAT WE WERE GOING TO GAIN FREEDOM
PearlArredondo_2013S FREEDOM TO HIRE THE TEACHERS THAT WE KNEW WERE GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE FREEDOM
PearlArredondo_2013S TO CONTROL THE CURRICULUM SO THAT WE 'RE NOT DOING LESSON ONE POINT TWO ON PAGE FIVE NO AND FREEDOM TO CONTROL A BUDGET
PearlArredondo_2013S TO SPEND MONEY WHERE IT MATTERS NOT HOW A DISTRICT OR A STATE SAYS YOU HAVE TO DO IT
PearlArredondo_2013S WE WANTED THOSE FREEDOMS BUT NOW SHIFTING AN ENTIRE PARADIGM
PearlArredondo_2013S BUT WE HAD TO DO IT OUR COMMUNITY DESERVED A NEW WAY OF DOING THINGS AND AS THE VERY FIRST PILOT MIDDLE SCHOOL IN ALL OF LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
PearlArredondo_2013S YOU BETTER BELIEVE THERE WAS SOME OPPOSITION
PearlArredondo_2013S AND IT WAS OUT OF FEAR FEAR OF WELL WHAT IF THEY GET IT WRONG
PearlArredondo_2013S SO IN OUR THIRD YEAR HOW DID WE DO IT
PearlArredondo_2013S WE MAKE OUR CURRICULUM RIGOROUS AND RELEVANT TO THEM
PearlArredondo_2013S AND THEY USE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY 'RE USED TO LAPTOPS COMPUTERS TABLETS YOU NAME IT THEY HAVE IT ANIMATION SOFTWARE MOVIEMAKING SOFTWARE THEY HAVE IT ALL AND BECAUSE WE CONNECT IT TO WHAT THEY 'RE DOING FOR EXAMPLE THEY MADE PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR THE CANCER SOCIETY
PearlArredondo_2013S THESE WERE PLAYED IN THE LOCAL TROLLEY SYSTEM TEACHING ELEMENTS OF PERSUASION
PearlArredondo_2013S AND IT TAKES AN ACTIVE PARENT CENTER WHO
PearlArredondo_2013S NOT ONLY THERE SHOWING A PRESENCE EVERY DAY BUT WHO IS PART OF OUR GOVERNANCE
PearlArredondo_2013S MAKING DECISIONS FOR THEIR KIDS OUR KIDS
PearlArredondo_2013S BECAUSE WHY SHOULD OUR STUDENTS HAVE TO GO SO FAR AWAY FROM WHERE THEY LIVE
PearlArredondo_2013S THEY DESERVE A QUALITY SCHOOL IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD A SCHOOL THAT THEY CAN BE PROUD TO SAY THEY ATTEND AND A SCHOOL THAT THE COMMUNITY CAN BE PROUD OF AS WELL
PearlArredondo_2013S AND THEY NEED TEACHERS TO FIGHT FOR THEM
PearlArredondo_2013S EVERY DAY AND EMPOWER THEM TO MOVE BEYOND THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE IT 'S TIME THAT KIDS LIKE ME
PearlArredondo_2013S STOP BEING THE EXCEPTION
