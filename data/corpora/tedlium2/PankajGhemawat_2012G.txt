PankajGhemawat_2012G 'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW GLOBALIZED WE ARE HOW GLOBALIZED WE AREN 'T AND WHY IT 'S IMPORTANT TO ACTUALLY BE ACCURATE IN MAKING THOSE KINDS OF ASSESSMENTS
PankajGhemawat_2012G AND THE LEADING POINT OF VIEW ON THIS WHETHER MEASURED BY NUMBER OF BOOKS SOLD MENTIONS IN MEDIA OR SURVEYS THAT I 'VE RUN WITH GROUPS RANGING FROM MY STUDENTS TO DELEGATES TO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION
PankajGhemawat_2012G IS THIS VIEW THAT NATIONAL BORDERS REALLY DON 'T MATTER
PankajGhemawat_2012G VERY MUCH ANYMORE
PankajGhemawat_2012G CROSS BORDER INTEGRATION IS CLOSE TO COMPLETE AND WE LIVE IN ONE WORLD
PankajGhemawat_2012G AND WHAT 'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS VIEW IS AGAIN IT 'S A VIEW THAT 'S HELD BY PRO GLOBALIZERS LIKE TOM FRIEDMAN FROM WHOSE BOOK THIS QUOTE IS OBVIOUSLY EXCERPTED
PankajGhemawat_2012G BUT IT 'S ALSO HELD BY ANTI GLOBALIZERS WHO SEE THIS GIANT GLOBALIZATION TSUNAMI THAT 'S ABOUT TO WRECK ALL OUR LIVES IF IT HASN 'T ALREADY DONE SO
PankajGhemawat_2012G WRITING IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY S ABOUT HOW THE RAILROAD
PankajGhemawat_2012G THE STEAM SHIP AND THE TELEGRAPH WERE INTEGRATING EAST AFRICA PERFECTLY WITH THE REST
PankajGhemawat_2012G OF THE WORLD NOW CLEARLY DAVID LIVINGSTONE WAS A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF HIS TIME BUT IT DOES SEEM USEFUL TO ASK OURSELVES JUST HOW GLOBAL ARE WE BEFORE WE THINK ABOUT WHERE WE GO FROM HERE
PankajGhemawat_2012G SO THE BEST WAY I 'VE FOUND OF TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO TAKE SERIOUSLY THE IDEA THAT THE WORLD MAY NOT BE FLAT MAY NOT EVEN BE CLOSE TO FLAT
PankajGhemawat_2012G IS WITH SOME DATA SO ONE OF THE THINGS I 'VE BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IS REALLY COMPILING DATA ON THINGS THAT COULD EITHER HAPPEN WITHIN NATIONAL BORDERS OR ACROSS NATIONAL BORDERS AND I 'VE LOOKED AT THE CROSS BORDER COMPONENT
PankajGhemawat_2012G AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL I 'M NOT GOING TO PRESENT ALL THE DATA THAT I HAVE HERE TODAY BUT LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A FEW DATA POINTS
PankajGhemawat_2012G I 'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ONE KIND OF INFORMATION FLOW ONE KIND OF FLOW OF PEOPLE ONE KIND OF FLOW OF CAPITAL AND OF COURSE TRADE IN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
PankajGhemawat_2012G SO LET 'S START OFF WITH PLAIN OLD TELEPHONE
PankajGhemawat_2012G SERVICE OF ALL THE VOICE CALLING MINUTES IN THE WORLD LAST YEAR WHAT PERCENTAGE DO YOU THINK WERE ACCOUNTED FOR BY CROSS BORDER PHONE CALLS PICK A PERCENTAGE IN YOUR OWN MIND
PankajGhemawat_2012G OR LET 'S TURN TO PEOPLE MOVING ACROSS BORDERS ONE PARTICULAR THING WE MIGHT LOOK AT IN TERMS OF LONG TERM FLOWS OF PEOPLE IS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE WORLD 'S POPULATION IS ACCOUNTED FOR BY FIRST GENERATION IMMIGRANTS
PankajGhemawat_2012G AGAIN PLEASE PICK A PERCENTAGE
PankajGhemawat_2012G TURNS OUT TO BE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER IT 'S ACTUALLY ABOUT THREE PERCENT OR THINK OF INVESTMENT TAKE ALL THE REAL INVESTMENT THAT WENT ON IN THE WORLD IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT WAS ACCOUNTED FOR BY FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT
PankajGhemawat_2012G NOT QUITE TEN PERCENT
PankajGhemawat_2012G AND THEN FINALLY THE ONE STATISTIC THAT I SUSPECT MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM HAVE SEEN THE EXPORT TO GDP RATIO IF YOU LOOK AT THE OFFICIAL STATISTICS THEY TYPICALLY INDICATE A LITTLE BIT ABOVE THIRTY PERCENT
PankajGhemawat_2012G HOWEVER THERE 'S A BIG PROBLEM WITH THE OFFICIAL STATISTICS
PankajGhemawat_2012G IN THAT IF FOR INSTANCE A JAPANESE COMPONENT SUPPLIER SHIPS SOMETHING TO CHINA TO BE PUT INTO AN IPOD AND THEN THE IPOD GETS SHIPPED TO THE U S THAT COMPONENT ENDS UP GETTING COUNTED MULTIPLE TIMES
PankajGhemawat_2012G SO NOBODY KNOWS HOW BAD THIS BIAS WITH THE OFFICIAL STATISTICS ACTUALLY IS SO I THOUGHT I WOULD ASK THE PERSON WHO 'S SPEARHEADING THE EFFORT TO GENERATE DATA ON THIS PASCAL LAMY THE DIRECTOR OF THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION WHAT HIS BEST GUESS WOULD BE
PankajGhemawat_2012G OF EXPORTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP WITHOUT THE DOUBLE AND TRIPLE COUNTING AND IT 'S ACTUALLY PROBABLY A BIT UNDER TWENTY PERCENT RATHER THAN THE THIRTY PERCENT PLUS NUMBERS THAT WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT SO
PankajGhemawat_2012G IT 'S VERY CLEAR THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS OR ALL THE OTHER NUMBERS THAT I TALK ABOUT IN MY BOOK WORLD THREE POINT ZERO THAT WE 'RE VERY VERY FAR FROM THE NO BORDER EFFECT BENCHMARK
PankajGhemawat_2012G WHICH WOULD IMPLY INTERNATIONALIZATION LEVELS OF THE ORDER OF EIGHTY FIVE NINETY NINETY FIVE PERCENT
PankajGhemawat_2012G SO CLEARLY APOCALYPTICALLY MINDED AUTHORS HAVE OVERSTATED THE CASE
PankajGhemawat_2012G BUT IT 'S NOT JUST THE APOCALYPTICS AS I THINK OF THEM WHO ARE PRONE TO THIS KIND OF OVERSTATEMENT I 'VE ALSO SPENT SOME TIME SURVEYING AUDIENCES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD ON WHAT THEY ACTUALLY GUESS THESE NUMBERS TO BE
PankajGhemawat_2012G SO A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS STAND OUT FOR ME FROM THIS SLIDE FIRST OF ALL THERE IS A SUGGESTION OF SOME ERROR
PankajGhemawat_2012G AND THIRD THIS IS NOT JUST CONFINED TO THE READERS OF THE HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW I 'VE RUN SEVERAL DOZEN SUCH SURVEYS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD
PankajGhemawat_2012G AND IN ALL CASES EXCEPT ONE WHERE A GROUP ACTUALLY UNDERESTIMATED THE TRADE TO GDP RATIO PEOPLE HAVE THIS TENDENCY TOWARDS OVERESTIMATION
PankajGhemawat_2012G AND SO I THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT TO GIVE A NAME TO THIS AND THAT 'S WHAT I REFER TO AS GLOBALONEY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DARK BLUE BARS AND THE LIGHT GRAY BARS
PankajGhemawat_2012G ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I SUSPECT SOME OF YOU MAY STILL BE A LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL OF THE CLAIMS I THINK IT 'S IMPORTANT TO JUST SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT WHY WE MIGHT BE PRONE TO GLOBALONEY A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT REASONS COME TO MIND
PankajGhemawat_2012G FIRST OF ALL THERE 'S A REAL DEARTH OF DATA
PankajGhemawat_2012G IN THE DEBATE LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WHEN I FIRST PUBLISHED SOME OF THESE DATA A FEW YEARS AGO IN A MAGAZINE CALLED FOREIGN POLICY ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE IN NOT ENTIRELY IN AGREEMENT WAS TOM FRIEDMAN
PankajGhemawat_2012G AND SINCE MY ARTICLE WAS TITLED WHY THE WORLD ISN 'T FLAT THAT WASN 'T TOO SURPRISING
PankajGhemawat_2012G WHICH WAS GHEMAWAT 'S DATA ARE NARROW AND THIS CAUSED ME TO SCRATCH MY HEAD BECAUSE AS I WENT BACK THROUGH HIS SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGE BOOK I COULDN 'T FIND A SINGLE FIGURE CHART TABLE REFERENCE
PankajGhemawat_2012G THAT WE 'VE BEEN BOMBARDED WITH ACTUALLY ARE CORRECT
PankajGhemawat_2012G SO DEARTH OF DATA IN THE DEBATE IS ONE REASON A SECOND REASON HAS TO DO WITH PEER PRESSURE
PankajGhemawat_2012G I REMEMBER I DECIDED TO WRITE MY WHY THE WORLD ISN 'T FLAT ARTICLE BECAUSE I WAS BEING INTERVIEWED ON TV IN MUMBAI AND THE INTERVIEWER 'S FIRST QUESTION TO ME WAS PROFESSOR GHEMAWAT
PankajGhemawat_2012G WHY DO YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD IS ROUND
PankajGhemawat_2012G AND I STARTED LAUGHING BECAUSE I HADN 'T COME ACROSS THAT FORMULATION BEFORE LAUGHTER AND AS I WAS LAUGHING I WAS THINKING I REALLY NEED A MORE COHERENT RESPONSE ESPECIALLY ON NATIONAL TV I 'D BETTER WRITE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS LAUGHTER BUT WHAT I CAN 'T QUITE
PankajGhemawat_2012G SO TRY THIS OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES IF YOU LIKE YOU 'LL FIND THAT IT 'S VERY COOL TO TALK ABOUT THE WORLD BEING ONE ETC IF YOU RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT FORMULATION YOU REALLY ARE CONSIDERED A BIT OF AN ANTIQUE
PankajGhemawat_2012G AND THEN THE FINAL REASON WHICH I MENTION ESPECIALLY TO A TED AUDIENCE WITH SOME TREPIDATION HAS TO DO WITH WHAT I CALL TECHNO TRANCES IF YOU LISTEN TO TECHNO MUSIC FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME IT DOES THINGS TO YOUR BRAINWAVE ACTIVITY
PankajGhemawat_2012G WITH EXAGGERATED CONCEPTIONS OF HOW TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO OVERPOWER IN THE VERY IMMEDIATE RUN
PankajGhemawat_2012G ALL CULTURAL BARRIERS ALL POLITICAL BARRIERS ALL GEOGRAPHIC BARRIERS BECAUSE AT THIS POINT I KNOW YOU AREN 'T ALLOWED TO ASK ME QUESTIONS BUT WHEN I GET TO THIS POINT IN MY LECTURE WITH MY STUDENTS HANDS GO UP
PankajGhemawat_2012G AND PEOPLE ASK ME YEAH BUT WHAT ABOUT FACEBOOK
PankajGhemawat_2012G AND I GOT THIS QUESTION OFTEN ENOUGH THAT I THOUGHT I 'D BETTER DO SOME RESEARCH ON FACEBOOK BECAUSE IN SOME SENSE
PankajGhemawat_2012G IT 'S THE IDEAL KIND OF TECHNOLOGY TO THINK ABOUT THEORETICALLY IT MAKES IT AS EASY TO FORM FRIENDSHIPS HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD AS OPPOSED TO RIGHT NEXT DOOR
PankajGhemawat_2012G WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE 'S FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK ARE ACTUALLY LOCATED IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN WHERE PEOPLE WE 'RE ANALYZING ARE BASED THE ANSWER IS PROBABLY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN TO FIFTEEN PERCENT
PankajGhemawat_2012G NON NEGLIGIBLE SO WE DON 'T LIVE IN AN ENTIRELY LOCAL OR NATIONAL WORLD BUT VERY VERY FAR FROM THE NINETY FIVE PERCENT LEVEL THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT
PankajGhemawat_2012G AND THE REASON 'S VERY SIMPLE WE DON 'T OR I HOPE WE DON 'T FORM FRIENDSHIPS AT RANDOM ON FACEBOOK THE TECHNOLOGY IS OVERLAID ON A PRE EXISTING MATRIX OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE
PankajGhemawat_2012G AND THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY DOESN 'T QUITE DISPLACE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE WHY WE GET FAR FEWER THAN NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR FRIENDS BEING LOCATED IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN WHERE WE ARE
PankajGhemawat_2012G SO DOES
PankajGhemawat_2012G ALL THIS MATTER OR IS GLOBALONEY JUST A HARMLESS WAY OF GETTING PEOPLE TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO GLOBALIZATION RELATED ISSUES I WANT TO SUGGEST THAT ACTUALLY GLOBALONEY CAN BE VERY HARMFUL TO YOUR HEALTH
PankajGhemawat_2012G FIRST OF ALL RECOGNIZING THAT THE GLASS IS ONLY TEN TO TWENTY PERCENT FULL IS CRITICAL TO SEEING THAT THERE MIGHT BE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL GAINS FROM ADDITIONAL INTEGRATION WHEREAS IF WE THOUGHT WE WERE ALREADY THERE
PankajGhemawat_2012G THERE WOULD BE NO PARTICULAR POINT TO PUSHING HARDER IT 'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE WE WOULDN 'T BE HAVING A CONFERENCE ON RADICAL OPENNESS
PankajGhemawat_2012G IF WE ALREADY THOUGHT WE WERE TOTALLY OPEN TO ALL THE KINDS OF INFLUENCES THAT ARE BEING TALKED ABOUT AT THIS CONFERENCE
PankajGhemawat_2012G SO BEING ACCURATE ABOUT HOW LIMITED GLOBALIZATION LEVELS ARE IS CRITICAL TO EVEN BEING ABLE TO NOTICE THAT THERE MIGHT BE ROOM FOR SOMETHING MORE SOMETHING THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE FURTHER TO GLOBAL WELFARE
PankajGhemawat_2012G WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
PankajGhemawat_2012G AVOIDING OVERSTATEMENT IS ALSO VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE IT REDUCES AND IN SOME CASES EVEN REVERSES SOME OF THE FEARS THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT GLOBALIZATION
PankajGhemawat_2012G SO I ACTUALLY SPEND MOST OF MY WORLD THREE POINT ZERO BOOK WORKING THROUGH A LITANY OF MARKET FAILURES AND FEARS THAT PEOPLE HAVE
PankajGhemawat_2012G THAT THEY WORRY GLOBALIZATION IS GOING TO EXACERBATE I 'M OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT FOR YOU TODAY SO LET ME JUST PRESENT TO YOU TWO HEADLINES AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF WHAT I HAVE IN MIND
PankajGhemawat_2012G THINK OF FRANCE AND THE CURRENT DEBATE ABOUT IMMIGRATION WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE IN FRANCE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE FRENCH POPULATION IS IMMIGRANTS THE ANSWER IS ABOUT TWENTY FOUR PERCENT THAT 'S THEIR GUESS
PankajGhemawat_2012G MAYBE REALIZING THAT THE NUMBER IS JUST EIGHT PERCENT MIGHT HELP COOL SOME OF THE SUPERHEATED RHETORIC THAT WE SEE AROUND THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE
PankajGhemawat_2012G OR TO TAKE AN EVEN MORE STRIKING EXAMPLE WHEN THE CHICAGO COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS DID A SURVEY OF AMERICANS ASKING THEM TO GUESS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE FEDERAL BUDGET WENT TO FOREIGN AID
PankajGhemawat_2012G THE GUESS WAS THIRTY PERCENT
PankajGhemawat_2012G WHICH IS SLIGHTLY IN EXCESS OF THE ACTUAL LEVEL ACTUALLY ABOUT ONE PERCENT LAUGHTER OF U S GOVERNMENTAL COMMITMENTS TO FEDERAL AID
PankajGhemawat_2012G THE REASSURING THING ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR SURVEY WAS WHEN IT WAS POINTED OUT TO PEOPLE HOW FAR THEIR ESTIMATES WERE FROM THE ACTUAL DATA SOME OF THEM NOT ALL OF THEM SEEMED TO BECOME MORE WILLING TO CONSIDER INCREASES IN FOREIGN AID
PankajGhemawat_2012G SO FOREIGN AID IS ACTUALLY A GREAT WAY OF SORT OF WRAPPING UP HERE BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT WHAT I 'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS THIS NOTION VERY UNCONTROVERSIAL AMONGST ECONOMISTS THAT MOST THINGS ARE VERY HOME BIASED
PankajGhemawat_2012G FOREIGN AID IS THE MOST AID TO POOR PEOPLE IS ABOUT THE MOST HOME BIASED THING YOU CAN FIND IF YOU LOOK AT THE OECD COUNTRIES AND HOW MUCH THEY SPEND PER DOMESTIC POOR PERSON AND COMPARE IT WITH HOW MUCH THEY SPEND PER POOR PERSON IN POOR COUNTRIES
PankajGhemawat_2012G THE RATIO BRANKO MILANOVIC AT THE WORLD BANK DID THE CALCULATIONS TURNS OUT TO BE ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND
PankajGhemawat_2012G TO ONE NOW OF COURSE
PankajGhemawat_2012G SOME OF US IF WE TRULY ARE COSMOPOLITAN WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT RATIO BEING BROUGHT DOWN TO ONE IS TO ONE
PankajGhemawat_2012G I 'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON 'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS FROM WHERE WE ARE
PankajGhemawat_2012G IF WE SIMPLY BROUGHT THAT RATIO DOWN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND TO ONE WE WOULD BE MEETING THOSE AID TARGETS THAT WERE AGREED AT THE RIO SUMMIT TWENTY YEARS AGO THAT THE SUMMIT THAT ENDED LAST WEEK MADE NO FURTHER PROGRESS ON SO IN SUMMARY WHILE RADICAL
