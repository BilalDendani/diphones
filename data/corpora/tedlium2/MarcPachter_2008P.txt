MarcPachter_2008P@15.71:24.63 THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY IS THE PLACE DEDICATED TO PRESENTING GREAT AMERICAN LIVES AMAZING PEOPLE AND
MarcPachter_2008P@25.09:33.40 THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT WE USE PORTRAITURE AS A WAY TO DELIVER THOSE LIVES BUT THAT'S IT AND SO I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PAINTED PORTRAIT TODAY
MarcPachter_2008P@33.69:39.99 I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT A PROGRAM I STARTED THERE WHICH FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IS THE PROUDEST THING I DID
MarcPachter_2008P@42.99:54.41 I STARTED TO WORRY ABOUT THE FACT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T GET THEIR PORTRAITS PAINTED ANYMORE AND THEY'RE AMAZING PEOPLE AND WE WANT TO DELIVER THEM TO FUTURE GENERATIONS SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
MarcPachter_2008P@54.74:66.16 AND SO I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF THE LIVING SELF PORTRAIT SERIES AND THE LIVING SELF PORTRAIT SERIES WAS THE IDEA OF BASICALLY MY BEING A BRUSH IN THE HAND OF AMAZING PEOPLE WHO WOULD COME AND I WOULD INTERVIEW
MarcPachter_2008P@73.38:82.35 OF HOW YOU ENCOUNTER PEOPLE IN THAT KIND OF SITUATION WHAT YOU TRY TO FIND OUT ABOUT THEM AND WHEN PEOPLE DELIVER AND WHEN THEY DON'T AND WHY
MarcPachter_2008P@83.96:94.13 NOW I HAD TWO PRECONDITIONS ONE WAS THAT THEY BE AMERICAN THAT'S JUST BECAUSE IN THE NATURE OF THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY IT'S CREATED TO LOOK AT AMERICAN LIVES
MarcPachter_2008P@95.25:103.02 THAT WAS EASY BUT THEN I MADE THE DECISION MAYBE ARBITRARY THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE PEOPLE OF A CERTAIN AGE
MarcPachter_2008P@103.43:112.47 WHICH AT THAT POINT WHEN I CREATED THIS PROGRAM SEEMED REALLY OLD SIXTIES SEVENTIES EIGHTIES AND NINETIES FOR OBVIOUS REASONS IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT OLD ANYMORE
MarcPachter_2008P@113.06:124.64 AND WHY DID I DO THAT WELL FOR ONE THING WE'RE A YOUTH OBSESSED CULTURE AND I THOUGHT REALLY WHAT WE NEED IS AN ELDERS PROGRAM TO JUST SIT AT THE FEET OF AMAZING PEOPLE AND HEAR THEM TALK
MarcPachter_2008P@124.95:135.41 BUT THE SECOND PART OF IT AND THE THE OLDER I GET THE MORE CONVINCED I AM THAT THAT'S TRUE IT'S AMAZING WHAT PEOPLE WILL SAY WHEN THEY KNOW HOW THE STORY TURNED OUT
MarcPachter_2008P@136.52:146.24 THAT'S THE ONE ADVANTAGE THAT OLDER PEOPLE HAVE WELL THEY HAVE OTHER LITTLE BIT OF ADVANTAGE BUT THEY ALSO HAVE SOME DISADVANTAGES BUT THE ONE THING THEY OR WE HAVE
MarcPachter_2008P@146.90:155.89 IS THAT WE'VE REACHED THE POINT IN LIFE WHERE WE KNOW HOW THE STORY TURNED OUT SO WE CAN THEN GO BACK IN OUR LIVES IF WE'VE GOT AN INTERVIEWER WHO GETS
MarcPachter_2008P@156.96:165.88 AND BEGIN TO REFLECT ON HOW WE GOT THERE ALL OF THOSE ACCIDENTS THAT WOUND UP CREATING THE LIFE NARRATIVE THAT WE INHERITED
MarcPachter_2008P@166.35:177.13 SO I THOUGHT OKAY NOW WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE TO MAKE THIS WORK THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF INTERVIEWS WE KNOW THEM THERE ARE THE JOURNALIST INTERVIEWS WHICH ARE THE INTERROGATION THAT IS EXPECTED
MarcPachter_2008P@177.90:190.26 THIS IS SOMEWHAT AGAINST RESISTANCE AND CAGINESS ON THE PART OF THE INTERVIEWEE THEN THERE'S THE CELEBRITY INTERVIEW WHERE IT'S MORE IMPORTANT WHO 'S ASKING THE QUESTION THAN WHO ANSWERS THAT'S BARBARA WALTERS AND
MarcPachter_2008P@191.20:203.65 OTHERS LIKE THAT AND WE LIKE THAT THAT'S FROST NIXON WHERE FROST SEEMS TO BE AS IMPORTANT AS NIXON IN THAT PROCESS FAIR ENOUGH BUT I WANTED INTERVIEWS THAT WERE DIFFERENT I WANTED TO BE
MarcPachter_2008P@205.39:217.16 AS I LATER THOUGHT OF IT EMPATHIC WHICH IS TO SAY TO FEEL WHAT THEY WANTED TO SAY AND TO BE AN AGENT OF THEIR SELF REVELATION
MarcPachter_2008P@217.86:230.36 BY THE WAY THIS WAS ALWAYS DONE IN PUBLIC THIS WAS NOT AN ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM THIS WAS ALL ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE SITTING AT THE FEET OF THIS INDIVIDUAL AND HAVING ME BE THE BRUSH IN THEIR SELF PORTRAIT
MarcPachter_2008P@231.11:237.79 NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT I WAS PRETTY GOOD AT THAT I DIDN'T KNOW IT COMING INTO IT AND THE ONLY REASON I REALLY NOW THAT
MarcPachter_2008P@238.15:245.01 IS BECAUSE OF ONE INTERVIEW I DID WITH SENATOR WILLIAM FULLBRIGHT AND THAT WAS SIX MONTHS AFTER HE'D HAD A STROKE
MarcPachter_2008P@246.32:253.04 AND HE HAD NEVER APPEARED IN PUBLIC SINCE THAT POINT THIS WAS NOT A DEVASTATING STROKE BUT IT DID AFFECT HIS SPEAKING AND SO FORTH
MarcPachter_2008P@253.82:262.89 AND I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH A CHANCE HE THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH A CHANCE AND SO WE GOT UP ON THE STAGE AND WE AN HOUR CONVERSION ABOUT HIS LIFE AND AFTER
MarcPachter_2008P@264.67:274.35 A WOMAN RUSHED UP TO ME ESSENTIALLY DID AND SHE SAID WHERE DID YOU TRAIN AS A DOCTOR AND I SAID I HAVE NO TRAINING AS A DOCTOR I NEVER CLAIMED THAT
MarcPachter_2008P@274.76:283.19 AND SHE SAID WELL SOMETHING VERY WEIRD WAS HAPPENING WHEN HE STARTED A SENTENCE PARTICULARLY IN THE EARLY PARTS OF THE INTERVIEW
MarcPachter_2008P@283.77:292.33 AND PAUSED YOU GAVE HIM THE WORD THE BRIDGE TO GET TO THE END OF THE SENTENCE AND BY THE END OF IT HE WAS SPEAKING COMPLETE SENTENCES ON
MarcPachter_2008P@293.07:305.87 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON BUT I WAS SO PART OF THE PROCESS OF GETTING THAT OUT SO I THOUGHT OKAY FINE I'VE GOT EMPATHY OR EMPATHY AT ANY RATE IS WHAT'S CRITICAL TO THIS KIND OF INTERVIEW
MarcPachter_2008P@306.29:314.28 BUT THEN I BEGAN TO THINK OF OTHER THINGS WHO MAKES A GREAT INTERVIEW IN THIS CONTEXT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR
MarcPachter_2008P@326.68:337.64 IT WAS ABOUT THEIR ENERGY IT'S ENERGY THAT CREATES EXTRAORDINARY INTERVIEWS AND EXTRAORDINARY LIVES I'M CONVINCED OF IT AND IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ENERGY
MarcPachter_2008P@337.92:345.54 OF BEING YOUNG THESE WERE PEOPLE THROUGH THEIR NINETIES IN FACT THE FIRST PERSON I INTERVIEWED WAS GEORGE ABBOTT WHO WAS NINETY SEVEN
MarcPachter_2008P@346.49:354.06 AND ABBOTT WAS FILLED WITH THE LIFE FORCE I GUESS THAT'S THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT FILLED WITH IT AND SO HE FILLED THE ROOM
MarcPachter_2008P@354.15:362.26 AND WE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY CONVERSATION HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE TOUGHEST INTERVIEW THAT ANYBODY WOULD EVER DO BECAUSE HE WAS FAMOUS FOR BEING SILENT
MarcPachter_2008P@362.45:370.80 FOR NEVER EVER SAYING ANYTHING EXCEPT MAYBE A WORD OR TWO AND IN FACT HE DID WIND UP OPENING UP BY THE WAY
MarcPachter_2008P@383.29:397.48 VERY GRUFF VOICE FROM A WOMAN I DIDN'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS AND SHE SAID DID YOU GET GEORGE ABBOTT TO TALK AND I SAID YEAH APPARENTLY I DID AND SHE SAID I 'M HIS OLD
MarcPachter_2008P@399.78:404.76 AND I COULD NEVER DO IT AND THEN SHE MADE ME GO UP WITH THE TAPE OF IT AND
MarcPachter_2008P@405.39:412.61 THAT GEORGE ABBOTT ACTUALLY COULD TALK SO YOU KNOW YOU WANT ENERGY YOU WANT THE LIFE FORCE BUT
MarcPachter_2008P@413.32:424.57 YOU REALLY WANT THEM ALSO TO THINK THAT THEY HAVE A STORY WORTH SHARING THE WORST INTERVIEWS THAT YOU CAN EVER HAVE ARE WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE MODEST
MarcPachter_2008P@425.30:431.60 NEVER EVER GET UP ON A STAGE WITH SOMEBODY WHO 'S MODEST BECAUSE ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASSEMBLED
MarcPachter_2008P@431.86:440.87 TO LISTEN TO THEM AND THEY SIT THERE AND THEY SAY AW SHUCKS IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THERE'S NOTHING THAT EVER HAPPENS THAT JUSTIFIES PEOPLE TAKING
MarcPachter_2008P@441.27:450.93 GOOD HOURS OF THE DAY TO BE WITH THEM THE WORST INTERVIEW I EVER DID WILLIAM L SHIRER THE JOURNALIST WHO DID THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD
MarcPachter_2008P@451.71:461.11 THIS GUY HAD MET HITLER AND GANDHI WITHIN SIX MONTHS AND EVERY TIME I'D ASK HIM ABOUT IT HE'D SAY OH I JUST HAPPENED TO BE THERE DIDN'T MATTER WHATEVER
MarcPachter_2008P@461.59:474.21 AWFUL I NEVER WOULD EVER AGREE TO INTERVIEW A MODEST PERSON THEY HAVE TO THINK THAT THEY DID SOMETHING AND THAT THEY WANT TO SHARE IT WITH YOU BUT IT COMES DOWN IN THE END TO
MarcPachter_2008P@475.02:484.45 HOW DO YOU GET THROUGH ALL THE BARRIERS WE HAVE ALL OF US ARE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BEINGS
MarcPachter_2008P@485.08:494.18 AND IF ALL YOU'RE GOING TO GET FROM THE INTERVIEWEE IS THEIR PUBLIC SELF THERE'S NO POINT IN IT IT'S PRE PROGRAMMED IT'S INFOMERCIAL
MarcPachter_2008P@494.97:503.03 AND WE ALL HAVE INFOMERCIALS ABOUT OUR LIVES WE KNOW THE GREAT LINES WE KNOW THE GREAT MOMENTS WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SHARE
MarcPachter_2008P@503.55:510.64 AND THE POINT OF THIS WAS NOT TO EMBARRASS ANYBODY THIS WASN'T AND SOME OF YOU WILL REMEMBER MIKE WALLACE 'S OLD INTERVIEWS TOUGH
MarcPachter_2008P@521.86:528.28 OF THE PUBLIC SELF AND THE MORE PUBLIC THEY HAD BEEN THE MORE ENTRENCHED THAT
MarcPachter_2008P@529.72:537.89 PERSON THAT OUTER PERSON WAS AND LET ME TELL YOU AT ONCE THE WORSE MOMENT AND THE BEST MOMENT THAT HAPPENED IN THIS INTERVIEW SERIES IT ALL HAS TO DO
MarcPachter_2008P@538.08:543.44 WITH THAT SHELL THAT MOST OF US HAVE AND PARTICULARLY CERTAIN PEOPLE
MarcPachter_2008P@545.77:553.18 WOMAN NAMED CLARE BOOTHE LUCE IT'LL BE YOUR GENERATIONAL DETERMINANT AS TO WHETHER HER NAME MEANS MUCH TO YOU
MarcPachter_2008P@553.76:562.04 SHE DID SO MUCH SHE WAS A PLAYWRIGHT SHE DID AN EXTRAORDINARY PLAY CALLED THE WOMEN SHE WAS
MarcPachter_2008P@562.77:571.53 A CONGRESSWOMAN WHEN THERE WEREN'T VERY MANY CONGRESSWOMEN SHE WAS EDITOR OF VANITY FAIR ONE OF THE GREAT PHENOMENAL WOMEN
MarcPachter_2008P@572.49:580.04 AND INCIDENTALLY I CALL HER THE ELEANOR ROOSEVELT OF THE RIGHT SHE WAS SORT OF ADORED
MarcPachter_2008P@580.39:587.75 ON THE RIGHT THE WAY ELEANOR ROOSEVELT WAS ON THE LEFT AND IN FACT WHEN WE DID THE INTERVIEW I DID THE LIVING SELF PORTRAIT WITH HER
MarcPachter_2008P@588.21:599.08 THERE WERE THREE FORMER DIRECTORS OF THE CIA BASICALLY SITTING AT HER FEET JUST ENJOYING HER PRESENCE AND I THOUGHT THIS IS GOING TO BE A PIECE OF CAKE BECAUSE I ALWAYS HAVE
MarcPachter_2008P@607.29:615.99 YOU DON'T GET IT ON THE STAGE SO SHE AND I HAD A DELIGHTFUL CONVERSATION WE WERE ON THE STAGE AND THEN
MarcPachter_2008P@616.55:624.33 BY THE WAY SPECTACULAR IT WAS ALL PART OF CLARE BOOTHE LUCE 'S LOOK SHE WAS IN A GREAT EVENING GOWN SHE WAS EIGHTY
MarcPachter_2008P@632.80:640.77 SHE STONEWALLED ME IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE ANYTHING THAT I WOULD ASK SHE WOULD TURN AROUND DISMISS
MarcPachter_2008P@641.09:651.82 AND I WAS BASICALLY UP THERE ANY OF YOU IN THE MODERATE TO FULL ENTERTAINMENT WORLD KNOW WHAT IT IS TO DIE ONSTAGE AND I WAS DYING SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT
MarcPachter_2008P@652.13:660.87 GIVING ME A THING AND I BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT WAS GOING ON AND YOU THINK WHILE YOU TALK AND BASICALLY I THOUGHT I GOT IT
MarcPachter_2008P@661.44:669.44 WHEN WE WERE ALONE I WAS HER AUDIENCE NOW I'M HER COMPETITOR FOR THE AUDIENCE THAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE AND SHE'S FIGHTING ME
MarcPachter_2008P@669.63:675.89 FOR THAT AND SO THEN I ASKED HER A QUESTION I DIDN'T KNOW HOW I WAS GOING TO GET OUT OF IT I ASKED HER A QUESTION ABOUT
MarcPachter_2008P@678.58:684.32 HER DAYS AS A PLAYWRIGHT AND AGAIN CHARACTERISTICALLY INSTEAD OF SAYING OH YES I WAS A PLAYWRIGHT AND
MarcPachter_2008P@693.05:705.61 THAT AND THEN SHE WENT OFF ON A TEAR AND SHE SAID OH WELL THERE WAS THAT ONE TIME THAT I WAS AN ACTRESS IT WAS FOR A CHARITY IN CONNECTICUT WHEN I WAS A CONGRESSWOMAN AND I GOT UP THERE AND SHE WENT ON AND ON AND THEN I GOT ON THE STAGE
MarcPachter_2008P@719.39:727.53 SHE LOOKED AT ME AND IT WAS LIKE THE SUCCESSFUL ARM WRESTLE AND THEN AFTER THAT SHE DELIVERED AN EXTRAORDINARY ACCOUNT
MarcPachter_2008P@727.78:738.49 OF WHAT HER LIFE REALLY WAS LIKE I HAVE TO END THAT ONE THIS IS MY TRIBUTE TO CLARE BOOTHE LUCE AGAIN A REMARKABLE PERSON I'M NOT POLITICALLY ATTRACTED TO HER BUT THROUGH HER LIFE FORCE
MarcPachter_2008P@738.62:746.24 I'M ATTRACTED TO HER AND THE WAY SHE DIED SHE HAD TOWARD THE END A BRAIN TUMOR THAT'S PROBABLY AS TERRIBLE
MarcPachter_2008P@746.63:753.38 A WAY TO DIE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND VERY FEW OF US WERE INVITED TO A DINNER PARTY
MarcPachter_2008P@754.89:768.85 AND SHE WAS IN HORRIBLE PAIN WE ALL KNEW THAT SHE STAYED IN HER ROOM EVERYBODY CAME THE BUTLER PASSED AROUND CANAPES THE USUAL SORT OF THING THEN AT A CERTAIN MOMENT THE DOOR OPENED
MarcPachter_2008P@769.32:776.78 AND SHE WALKED OUT PERFECTLY DRESSED COMPLETELY COMPOSED THE PUBLIC SELF THE BEAUTY THE INTELLECT
MarcPachter_2008P@777.11:784.52 AND SHE WALKED AROUND AND TALKED TO EVERY PERSON THERE AND THEN WENT BACK INTO THE ROOM AND WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN
MarcPachter_2008P@784.95:794.22 SHE WANTED THE CONTROL OF HER FINAL MOMENT AND SHE DID IT AMAZINGLY NOW THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT YOU GET SOMEBODY TO OPEN UP
MarcPachter_2008P@794.84:805.60 AND THIS IS JUST A BRIEF REFERENCE IT WASN'T THIS ARM WRESTLE BUT IT WAS A LITTLE SURPRISING FOR THE PERSON INVOLVED I INTERVIEWED STEVE MARTIN IT WASN'T ALL THAT LONG AGO
MarcPachter_2008P@806.42:812.85 AND WE WERE SITTING THERE AND ALMOST TOWARD THE BEGINNING OF THE INTERVIEW I TURNED TO HIM AND I SAID
MarcPachter_2008P@814.57:820.09 MISTER MARTIN IT IS SAID THAT ALL COMEDIANS HAVE UNHAPPY
MarcPachter_2008P@822.36:835.41 WAS YOURS UNHAPPY AND HE LOOKED AT ME YOU KNOW AS IF TO SAY THIS IS HOW YOU'RE GOING TO START THIS THING RIGHT OFF AND THEN HE TURNED TO ME NOT STUPIDLY AND HE SAID WHAT WAS YOUR CHILDHOOD LIKE
MarcPachter_2008P@836.38:843.91 AND I SAID THESE ARE ALL ARM WRESTLES BUT THEY'RE AFFECTIONATE AND I SAID MY FATHER WAS LOVING AND SUPPORTIVE WHICH IS WHY I'M NOT FUNNY
MarcPachter_2008P@846.77:859.21 HE LOOKED AT ME AND THEN WE HEARD THE BIG SAD STORY HIS FATHER WAS AN SOB AND IN FACT HE WAS ANOTHER COMEDIAN WITH AN UNHAPPY CHILDHOOD BUT THEN WE WERE OFF AND RUNNING SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS
MarcPachter_2008P@859.53:867.51 THE KEY THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW THIS TO PROCEED NOW THESE ARE ARM WRESTLE QUESTIONS BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT
MarcPachter_2008P@882.10:889.78 ONE WAS AN INTERVIEW I DID WITH ONE OF THE GREAT AMERICAN BIOGRAPHERS AGAIN SOME OF YOU WILL KNOW HIM MOST OF YOU WON 'T DUMAS MALONE
MarcPachter_2008P@890.04:898.26 HE DID A FIVE VOLUME BIOGRAPHY OF THOMAS JEFFERSON SPENT VIRTUALLY HIS WHOLE LIFE WITH THOMAS JEFFERSON
MarcPachter_2008P@899.11:905.65 AND BY THE WAY AT ONE POINT I ASKED HIM WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE MET HIM AND HE SAID WELL OF COURSE BUT ACTUALLY
MarcPachter_2008P@905.78:915.78 I KNOW HIM BETTER THAN ANYONE WHO EVER MET HIM BECAUSE I GOT TO READ ALL OF HIS LETTERS SO HE WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP THEY HAD OVER FIFTY YEARS AND I ASKED
MarcPachter_2008P@917.80:922.69 ONE QUESTION I SAID DID JEFFERSON EVER DISAPPOINT YOU
MarcPachter_2008P@923.11:928.61 AND HERE IS THIS MAN WHO HAD GIVEN HIS WHOLE LIFE TO UNCOVERING JEFFERSON AND CONNECTING WITH HIM
MarcPachter_2008P@929.70:940.54 AND HE SAID WELL I'M GOING TO DO A BAD SOUTHERN ACCENT DUMAS MALONE WAS FROM MISSISSIPPI ORIGINALLY BUT HE SAID WELL HE SAID I 'M AFRAID SO
MarcPachter_2008P@942.09:952.84 HE SAID YOU KNOW I'VE READ EVERYTHING AND SOMETIMES MISTER JEFFERSON WOULD SMOOTH THE TRUTH A BIT AND HE
MarcPachter_2008P@962.94:970.21 HE SAID I UNDERSTAND THAT HE SAID WE SOUTHERNERS DO LIKE A SMOOTH SURFACE SO THAT
MarcPachter_2008P@970.65:977.31 THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE JUST DIDN'T WANT THE CONFRONTATION AND HE SAID NOW JOHN ADAMS WAS TOO HONEST
MarcPachter_2008P@977.53:988.22 AND HE STARTED TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND LATER ON HE INVITED ME TO HIS HOUSE AND I MET HIS WIFE WHO WAS FROM MASSACHUSETTS AND HE AND SHE HAD EXACTLY THE RELATIONSHIP OF THOMAS JEFFERSON AND JOHN ADAMS
MarcPachter_2008P@989.24:1003.71 THE NEW ENGLANDER AND ABRASIVE AND HE WAS THIS COURTLY FELLOW BUT REALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION I EVER ASKED AND MOST OF THE TIMES WHEN I TALK ABOUT IT PEOPLE KIND OF SUCK IN THEIR BREATH AT MY AUDACITY OR CRUELTY
MarcPachter_2008P@1004.89:1014.03 BUT I PROMISE YOU IT WAS THE RIGHT QUESTION THIS WAS TO AGNES DE MILLE AGNES DE MILLE IS ONE OF THE GREAT CHOREOGRAPHERS
MarcPachter_2008P@1014.35:1027.66 IN OUR HISTORY SHE BASICALLY CREATED THE DANCES IN OKLAHOMA TRANSFORMING THE AMERICAN THEATER AN AMAZING WOMAN AT THE TIME THAT I PROPOSED TO HER THAT
MarcPachter_2008P@1028.22:1036.47 BY THE WAY I WOULD HAVE PROPOSED TO HER SHE WAS EXTRAORDINARY BUT PROPOSED TO HER THAT SHE COME ON SHE SAID COME TO MY APARTMENT SHE LIVED NEW YORK
MarcPachter_2008P@1036.79:1044.40 COME TO MY APARTMENT AND WE'LL TALK FOR THOSE FIFTEEN MINUTES AND THEN WE'LL DECIDE WHETHER WE PROCEED AND SO I SHOWED UP IN THIS
MarcPachter_2008P@1045.27:1057.89 DARK RAMBLING NEW YORK APARTMENT AND SHE CALLED OUT TO ME AND SHE WAS IN BED I HAD KNOWN THAT SHE HAD HAD A STROKE AND THAT WAS SOME TEN YEARS BEFORE AND SO SHE SPENT ALMOST ALL OF HER LIFE IN BED
MarcPachter_2008P@1059.19:1070.57 BUT I SPEAK OF THE LIFE FORCE HER HAIR WAS ASKEW SHE WASN'T ABOUT TO MAKE UP FOR THIS OCCASION AND SHE WAS SITTING THERE SURROUNDED BY BOOKS AND HER MOST
MarcPachter_2008P@1081.13:1091.37 UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS SHE WAS RESIGNED SHE SAID I KEEP THIS WILL BY MY BED MEMENTO MORI AND I CHANGE IT ALL THE TIME
MarcPachter_2008P@1092.66:1101.47 JUST BECAUSE I WANT TO AND SHE WAS LOVING THE PROSPECT OF DEATH AS MUCH AS SHE HAD LOVED LIFE I THOUGHT THIS IS SOMEBODY I'VE GOT TO GET
MarcPachter_2008P@1101.69:1110.18 IN THIS SERIES SHE AGREED SHE CAME ON OF COURSE SHE WAS WHEELCHAIRED ON HALF OF HER BODY WAS STRICKEN THE OTHER HALF NOT
MarcPachter_2008P@1110.93:1120.11 SHE WAS OF COURSE DONE UP FOR THE OCCASION BUT THIS WAS A WOMAN IN GREAT PHYSICAL DISTRESS AND WE HAD A CONVERSATION AND THEN I ASKED
MarcPachter_2008P@1120.40:1133.44 THIS UNTHINKABLE QUESTION I SAID WAS IT A PROBLEM FOR YOU IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU WERE NOT BEAUTIFUL AND
MarcPachter_2008P@1134.19:1141.43 THE AUDIENCE JUST YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALWAYS ON THE SIDE OF THE INTERVIEWEE AND THEY FELT THAT THIS WAS A KIND OF ASSAULT BUT
MarcPachter_2008P@1141.79:1150.88 THIS WAS THE QUESTION SHE HAD WANTED SOMEBODY TO ASK HER WHOLE LIFE AND SHE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT HER CHILDHOOD WHEN SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL
MarcPachter_2008P@1164.26:1172.67 LIGHT STEPS AND SO FORTH AND THEN SHE SAID AND THEN PUBERTY HIT AND SHE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER BODY AND HER FACE
MarcPachter_2008P@1173.14:1181.24 AND HOW SHE COULD NO LONGER COUNT ON HER BEAUTY AND HER FAMILY THEN TREATED HER LIKE THE UGLY SISTER
MarcPachter_2008P@1181.44:1193.14 OF THE BEAUTIFUL ONE FOR WHOM ALL THE BALLET LESSONS WERE GIVEN AND SHE HAD TO GO ALONG JUST TO BE WITH HER SISTER FOR COMPANY AND IN THAT PROCESS SHE MADE A NUMBER OF DECISIONS
MarcPachter_2008P@1193.61:1201.73 FIRST OF ALL WAS THAT DANCE EVEN THOUGH IT HADN'T BEEN OFFERED TO HER WAS HER LIFE AND SECONDLY SHE HAD BETTER BE ALTHOUGH SHE DID DANCE FOR A WHILE A CHOREOGRAPHER
MarcPachter_2008P@1202.05:1210.96 BECAUSE THEN HER LOOKS DIDN'T MATTER BUT SHE WAS THRILLED TO GET THAT OUT AS A REAL REAL FACT IN HER LIFE
MarcPachter_2008P@1211.79:1221.92 IT WAS AN AMAZING PRIVILEGE TO DO THIS SERIES THERE WERE OTHER MOMENTS LIKE THAT VERY FEW MOMENTS OF SILENCE
MarcPachter_2008P@1222.73:1232.57 THE KEY POINT WAS EMPATHY BECAUSE EVERYBODY IN THEIR LIVES IS REALLY WAITING FOR PEOPLE TO ASK THEM QUESTIONS
MarcPachter_2008P@1233.13:1239.91 SO THAT THEY CAN BE TRUTHFUL ABOUT WHO THEY ARE AND HOW THEY BECAME WHAT THEY ARE AND I COMMEND THAT TO YOU
MarcPachter_2008P@1240.28:1248.08 EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT DOING INTERVIEWS JUST BE THAT WAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND PARTICULARLY THE OLDER MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
