FrankGehry_1990@15.69:20.24 GO RIGHT INTO THE SLIDES AND ALL I'M GOING TO TRY AND PROVE TO YOU WITH THESE SLIDES IS THAT
FrankGehry_1990@26.44:35.56 MY IDEAS ARE IN MY HEAD ANYWAY THEY'RE VERY LOGICAL AND RELATE TO WHAT'S GOING ON AND PROBLEM SOLVING FOR CLIENTS
FrankGehry_1990@39.78:50.69 EITHER CONVINCE CLIENTS AT THE END THAT I SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS OR I REALLY DO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS BECAUSE USUALLY THEY SEEM TO LIKE IT LET ME GO RIGHT INTO
FrankGehry_1990@51.78:52.97 THE SLIDES CAN YOU TURN OFF
FrankGehry_1990@57.89:61.56 I LIKE TO BE IN THE DARK I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE WHAT I'M DOING
FrankGehry_1990@64.64:70.32 ANYWAY I DID THIS HOUSE IN SANTA MONICA AND IT GOT A LOT OF NOTORIETY IN FACT
FrankGehry_1990@70.73:71.98 IT APPEARED IN A PORNO
FrankGehry_1990@73.61:75.23 WHICH IS THE SLIDE ON THE RIGHT
FrankGehry_1990@85.04:92.82 IS IN VENICE I JUST SHOW IT BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW I'M CONCERNED ABOUT CONTEXT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE
FrankGehry_1990@93.79:105.35 I HAD THE CONTEXT OF THOSE LITTLE HOUSES AND I TRIED TO BUILD A BUILDING THAT FIT INTO THAT CONTEXT WHEN PEOPLE TAKE PICTURES OF THESE BUILDINGS OUT OF THAT CONTEXT THEY LOOK REALLY WEIRD
FrankGehry_1990@115.17:128.51 THEN ONCE I DEAL WITH THE CONTEXT I THEN TRY TO MAKE A PLACE THAT'S COMFORTABLE AND PRIVATE AND FAIRLY SERENE AS I HOPE YOU'LL FIND THAT SLIDE ON THE RIGHT
FrankGehry_1990@130.39:132.52 AND THEN I DID A LAW SCHOOL FOR
FrankGehry_1990@133.82:135.49 LOYOLA IN DOWNTOWN L A
FrankGehry_1990@135.87:138.91 I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING A PLACE FOR THE STUDY OF LAW
FrankGehry_1990@142.54:146.80 AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THIS CLIENT THE BUILDING
FrankGehry_1990@148.06:161.59 RIGHT AT THE TOP IS NOW UNDER CONSTRUCTION THE GARAGE ON THE RIGHT THE GRAY STRUCTURE WILL BE TORN DOWN FINALLY AND SEVERAL SMALL CLASSROOMS WILL BE PLACED ALONG THIS
FrankGehry_1990@162.67:164.63 AVENUE THAT WE'VE CREATED THIS CAMPUS
FrankGehry_1990@165.59:176.66 AND IT ALL RELATED TO THE CLIENTS AND THE STUDENTS FROM THE VERY FIRST MEETING SAYING THEY FELT DENIED A PLACE THEY WANTED A SENSE OF PLACE
FrankGehry_1990@177.97:179.63 SO THE WHOLE IDEA HERE WAS TO CREATE
FrankGehry_1990@181.02:181.99 KIND OF SPACE
FrankGehry_1990@186.93:195.24 WAS DIFFICULT TO FIT INTO AND IT WAS MY THEORY OR MY POINT OF VIEW THAT ONE DIDN'T
FrankGehry_1990@196.98:206.68 UPSTAGE THE NEIGHBORHOOD ONE MADE ACCOMMODATIONS I TRIED TO BE INCLUSIVE TO INCLUDE THE BUILDINGS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHETHER THEY WERE BUILDINGS I LIKED OR NOT
FrankGehry_1990@217.85:221.40 MADE FLOORING WALLS AND EVERYTHING OUT OF CARDBOARD
FrankGehry_1990@222.44:224.88 AND THE SUCCESS OF IT THREW ME FOR A LOOP
FrankGehry_1990@225.20:234.79 I COULDN'T DEAL WITH THE SUCCESS OF FURNITURE I WASN'T SECURE ENOUGH AS AN ARCHITECT AND SO I CLOSED IT ALL UP AND MADE FURNITURE THAT NOBODY WOULD LIKE
FrankGehry_1990@254.32:257.71 AFTER WE FAILED I JUST KEPT FAILING
FrankGehry_1990@265.36:270.58 PIECE ON THE LEFT AND THAT ULTIMATELY LED TO THE PIECE ON THE RIGHT HAPPENED
FrankGehry_1990@270.76:277.52 WHEN THE KID THAT WAS WORKING ON THIS TOOK ONE OF THOSE LONG STRINGS OF STUFF AND FOLDED IT UP TO PUT IT IN THE WASTEBASKET
FrankGehry_1990@278.58:286.87 AND I PUT A PIECE OF TAPE AROUND IT AS YOU SEE THERE AND REALIZED YOU COULD SIT ON IT AND IT HAD A LOT OF RESILIENCE AND STRENGTH AND SO ON SO
FrankGehry_1990@287.36:289.38 IT WAS AN ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERY
FrankGehry_1990@297.67:299.42 I GOT INTO FISH
FrankGehry_1990@306.86:312.51 I MEAN THE STORY I TELL IS THAT I GOT MAD AT POSTMODERNISM AT POMO AND
FrankGehry_1990@313.80:317.63 SAID THAT FISH WERE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS EARLIER THAN MAN
FrankGehry_1990@318.64:322.21 AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO BACK WE MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING AND SO
FrankGehry_1990@324.17:325.45 MAKING THESE FUNNY
FrankGehry_1990@328.00:329.99 AND THEY STARTED TO HAVE A LIFE OF THEIR OWN
FrankGehry_1990@331.27:335.94 AND GOT BIGGER AS THE ONE GLASS AT THE WALKER AND THEN
FrankGehry_1990@337.39:344.59 I SLICED OFF THE HEAD AND THE TAIL AND EVERYTHING AND TRIED TO TRANSLATE WHAT I WAS LEARNING ABOUT THE FORM
FrankGehry_1990@345.57:351.97 FISH AND THE MOVEMENT AND A LOT OF MY ARCHITECTURAL IDEAS THAT CAME FROM IT ACCIDENTAL AGAIN
FrankGehry_1990@353.23:361.53 AN INTUITIVE KIND OF THING AND I JUST KEPT GOING WITH IT AND MADE THIS PROPOSAL FOR A BUILDING WHICH WAS ONLY A PROPOSAL
FrankGehry_1990@363.54:364.94 I DID THIS BUILDING IN JAPAN
FrankGehry_1990@367.46:369.39 I WAS TAKEN
FrankGehry_1990@369.70:377.34 OUT TO DINNER AFTER THE CONTRACT FOR THIS LITTLE RESTAURANT WAS SIGNED AND I LOVE SAKE AND KOBE AND ALL THAT STUFF
FrankGehry_1990@378.42:381.12 AND AFTER I GOT I WAS REALLY
FrankGehry_1990@384.27:386.95 I WAS ASKED TO DO SOME SKETCHES ON
FrankGehry_1990@392.69:404.43 AND I MADE SOME SKETCHES ON NAPKINS LITTLE BOXES AND MORANDI LIKE THINGS THAT I USED TO DO AND THE CLIENT SAID WHY NO FISH AND SO I MADE A DRAWING WITH A FISH
FrankGehry_1990@406.49:412.34 JAPAN THREE WEEKS LATER I RECEIVED A COMPLETE SET OF DRAWINGS SAYING WE'D WON THE COMPETITION
FrankGehry_1990@427.07:427.40 TO
FrankGehry_1990@435.54:440.95 OLDENBURG WHO I WORK WITH A LITTLE ONCE IN A WHILE TOLD ME I COULDN'T DO IT AND SO THAT
FrankGehry_1990@446.04:451.86 BUT HE WAS RIGHT I COULDN'T DO THE TAIL I STARTED TO GET THE HEAD OK BUT THE TAIL I
FrankGehry_1990@454.51:467.26 THE THING ON THE RIGHT IS A SNAKE FORM A ZIGGURAT AND I PUT THEM TOGETHER AND YOU WALK BETWEEN THEM IT WAS A DIALOG WITH THE CONTEXT AGAIN NOW IF YOU SAW A PICTURE OF THIS AS IT WAS
FrankGehry_1990@469.11:480.82 RECORD THEY DIDN'T SHOW THE CONTEXT SO YOU WOULD THINK GOD WHAT A PUSHY GUY THIS IS BUT A FRIEND OF MINE SPENT FOUR HOURS WANDERING AROUND HERE LOOKING FOR THIS RESTAURANT COULDN'T FIND IT SO
FrankGehry_1990@492.80:505.64 AS FOR CRAFT AND TECHNOLOGY AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT YOU'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT I WAS THROWN FOR A COMPLETE LOOP THIS WAS BUILT IN SIX MONTHS THE WAY WE SENT DRAWINGS TO
FrankGehry_1990@506.79:518.87 WE USED THE MAGIC COMPUTER IN MICHIGAN THAT DOES CARVED MODELS AND WE USED TO MAKE FOAM MODELS WHICH THAT THING SCANNED WE MADE THE DRAWINGS OF FISH AND SCALES
FrankGehry_1990@543.55:545.59 BUILDING IN L A FOR REASONS
FrankGehry_1990@546.86:547.24 WANT
FrankGehry_1990@549.55:551.57 DELAYED TOXIC
FrankGehry_1990@555.99:560.03 SO WE BUILT A TEMPORARY BUILDING I'M GETTING GOOD
FrankGehry_1990@572.84:578.29 THERE IS A STORY IT'S A REAL STORY ABOUT MY GRANDMOTHER BUYING A CARP ON THURSDAY BRINGING IT HOME
FrankGehry_1990@591.39:591.67 'S
FrankGehry_1990@594.97:602.16 AND I MADE A PEDESTAL FOR A SCULPTURE AND HE DIDN'T BUY A SCULPTURE SO I MADE ONE I WENT AROUND
FrankGehry_1990@617.79:620.98 PEOPLE LIKE OLDENBURG WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR A LONG
FrankGehry_1990@626.31:630.66 THINGS A FEW YEARS AGO WE DID A PERFORMANCE PIECE IN VENICE ITALY
FrankGehry_1990@647.79:653.55 AND THEY WERE CLAES 'S ASSISTANTS IN THE PLAY HE WAS THE SWISS ARMY KNIFE
FrankGehry_1990@681.31:691.29 I GET CREDIT FOR PARTICIPATING IN AND I CAN TELL YOU IT'S TOTALLY AN OLDENBURG I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT THE ONLY THING I DID WAS I MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO TURN THOSE BLADES
FrankGehry_1990@700.97:712.08 WITH THINGS LIKE CHAIN LINK FENCING I DO IT BECAUSE IT'S A CURIOUS THING IN THE CULTURE WHEN THINGS ARE MADE IN SUCH GREAT QUANTITIES ABSORBED IN SUCH GREAT QUANTITIES AND
FrankGehry_1990@714.43:721.18 PEOPLE HATE IT AND I'M FASCINATED WITH THAT WHICH LIKE THE PAPER FURNITURE IT'S ONE OF THOSE MATERIALS AND
FrankGehry_1990@723.11:723.93 AND
FrankGehry_1990@730.72:733.83 THE LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL
FrankGehry_1990@751.36:762.88 TRYING TO COLLIDE OUR IDEAS TO PUT OBJECTS NEXT TO EACH OTHER LIKE A MORANDI LIKE THE LITTLE BOTTLES COMPOSING THEM LIKE A STILL LIFE AND IT SEEMED TO WORK AS A WAY TO
FrankGehry_1990@801.40:806.59 SENT ME THE FIRST MODEL OF THE REAL PROPOSAL IT MADE MY BUILDING
FrankGehry_1990@807.63:816.43 AND IT WAS THIS INTERACTION BETWEEN THAT KIND OF UP THE ANTE STUFF THAT BECAME PRETTY INTERESTING IT LED TO THE BUILDING ON THE LEFT
FrankGehry_1990@817.28:820.77 AND I STILL THINK THE TIME MAGAZINE PICTURE WILL BE OF THE BINOCULARS
FrankGehry_1990@837.38:837.67 THE
FrankGehry_1990@849.73:851.54 WANT I'LL USE THE CRAFT I CAN GET
FrankGehry_1990@852.26:859.77 AND THERE WERE PLENTY OF MODELS FOR THAT IN RAUSCHENBERG AND JASPER JOHNS AND MANY ARTISTS WHO WERE MAKING BEAUTIFUL
FrankGehry_1990@861.15:866.81 WITH JUNK MATERIALS I WENT INTO THE METAL BECAUSE IT WAS A WAY OF BUILDING A BUILDING
FrankGehry_1990@869.44:874.18 WAS A SCULPTURE AND IT WAS ALL OF ONE MATERIAL AND THE METAL COULD GO ON
FrankGehry_1990@888.12:901.81 AND CANADA IN WASHINGTON AND I DID IT ON THE CONDITION THAT THEY BECOME MY PARTNERS IN THE FUTURE AND HELP ME WITH ALL FUTURE METAL BUILDINGS ET CETERA ET CETERA AND IT'S WORKING VERY WELL TO HAVE THESE
FrankGehry_1990@932.93:936.34 MILLER HAS THIS PHILOSOPHY OF HAVING A PLACE A PEOPLE
FrankGehry_1990@940.16:952.27 THING TO SAY BUT IT IS REAL THAT THEY WANTED TO HAVE A CENTRAL PLACE WHERE THE CAFETERIA WOULD BE WHERE THE PEOPLE WOULD COME AND WHERE THE PEOPLE WORKING WOULD INTERACT
FrankGehry_1990@954.55:965.78 SO IT'S OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE AND YOU APPROACH IT IT'S COPPER AND GALVANIZE AND I USED THE GALVANIZE AND COPPER IN A VERY
FrankGehry_1990@967.14:969.08 GAUGE SO IT WOULD BUCKLE
FrankGehry_1990@971.44:974.15 UNDOING RICHARD MEIER 'S AESTHETIC
FrankGehry_1990@1000.64:1008.09 THEY WOULD LET STANLEY DO A CAMEO PIECE WITH ME BECAUSE THESE WERE IDEAS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BUILDING
FrankGehry_1990@1008.66:1012.25 THINGS NEXT TO EACH OTHER MAKING IT'S ALL ABOUT METAPHOR FOR A CITY
FrankGehry_1990@1013.72:1017.51 AND SO STANLEY DID THE LITTLE DOME THING AND WE DID IT OVER THE PHONE AND
FrankGehry_1990@1020.60:1022.66 SHOW ME SOMETHING HE'D MADE A BUILDING
FrankGehry_1990@1027.95:1028.28 HE
FrankGehry_1990@1035.15:1047.54 BUILDING BUT HE PUT SOME FUNNY DETAILS ON IT AND HE MOVED IT CLOSER TO MY BUILDING AND SO I DECIDED TO PUT HIM IN A
FrankGehry_1990@1056.71:1064.70 BACK AND FORTH OVER A COUPLE OF WEEKS PERIOD AND HE PUT THESE TWO BRIDGES WITH PINK GUARD RAILS ON IT AND SO THEN I PUT THIS BIG BILLBOARD BEHIND
FrankGehry_1990@1081.71:1087.93 WE HAD THAT OLD BUILDING ON THE LEFT IT WAS A VERY PROMINENT BUILDING OFF THE FREEWAY AND WE ADDED A FLOOR
FrankGehry_1990@1089.60:1096.59 IT UP AND FIXED IT UP AND USED THE KIND OF I THOUGHT THE LANGUAGE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH
FrankGehry_1990@1097.17:1100.80 THESE CORNICES PROJECTING CORNICES MINE GOT A LITTLE EXUBERANT
FrankGehry_1990@1106.39:1108.74 LEAD COPPER WHICH IS A BEAUTIFUL MATERIAL
FrankGehry_1990@1110.47:1114.34 TURNS GREEN IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS INSTEAD OF LIKE COPPER IN TEN OR FIFTEEN
FrankGehry_1990@1118.30:1132.07 WE REDID THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING AND REPROPORTIONED THE WINDOWS SO IT SORT OF FIT INTO THE SPACE AND IT SURPRISED BOTH BOSTON AND MYSELF THAT WE GOT IT APPROVED BECAUSE THEY HAVE VERY STRICT KIND OF DESIGN GUIDELINE
FrankGehry_1990@1134.57:1136.63 AND THEY WOULDN'T NORMALLY THINK
FrankGehry_1990@1139.49:1142.81 THE DETAILING WAS VERY CAREFUL WITH THE LEAD COPPER AND
FrankGehry_1990@1176.52:1183.10 AND THEN MORE METAL AND SOME CHAIN LINK IN SANTA MONICA A LITTLE SHOPPING CENTER
FrankGehry_1990@1189.49:1192.19 AND THIS IS A LASER LABORATORY AT THE UNIVERSITY
FrankGehry_1990@1194.20:1195.63 IN WHICH THE FISH COMES BACK
FrankGehry_1990@1203.61:1207.17 THE SUPPORT LABS WHICH BY
FrankGehry_1990@1226.90:1236.06 AND SO IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT I SEIZED BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE ANY PROTRUDING DUCTS OR VENTS OR THINGS IN THIS FORM IT
FrankGehry_1990@1241.71:1242.69 SMALL HOUSE
FrankGehry_1990@1258.02:1261.00 HOUSE ALONG THE STREAM DAMMED IT UP TO MAKE A LAKE
FrankGehry_1990@1262.44:1263.81 THESE ARE THE MODELS
FrankGehry_1990@1270.01:1272.28 THE WORKMANSHIP IS PRETTY BAD
FrankGehry_1990@1274.91:1282.52 AND IT REMINDED ME WHY I PLAY DEFENSIVELY IN THINGS LIKE MY HOUSE WHEN YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING REALLY CHEAPLY
FrankGehry_1990@1284.33:1287.52 IT'S HARD TO GET PERFECT CORNERS
FrankGehry_1990@1305.26:1308.44 AND IN IT IS YOU GO DOWNSTAIRS INTO THE LIVING ROOM AND
FrankGehry_1990@1331.85:1333.87 I THOUGHT IT WAS FITTING FOR ME TO BE DOING
FrankGehry_1990@1340.15:1344.77 THIS IS A HOUSE NEXT TO A PHILIP JOHNSON HOUSE IN MINNESOTA
FrankGehry_1990@1353.35:1355.00 DIDN'T RECOMMEND ME BY THE WAY
FrankGehry_1990@1358.58:1359.14 WE
FrankGehry_1990@1361.20:1369.95 ENDED UP HAVING TO MAKE IT A SCULPTURE BECAUSE THE DILEMMA WAS HOW DO YOU BUILD A BUILDING THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE LANGUAGE IS IT GOING TO LOOK LIKE THIS BEAUTIFUL
FrankGehry_1990@1371.94:1383.26 THE IDEA AND SO WE FINALLY ENDED UP MAKING IT THESE PEOPLE ARE ART COLLECTORS AND WE FINALLY MADE IT SO IT APPEARS VERY SCULPTURAL FROM
FrankGehry_1990@1385.63:1386.82 ALL THE WINDOWS ARE ON THE
FrankGehry_1990@1391.56:1395.02 AND THE BUILDING IS VERY SCULPTURAL AS YOU WALK AROUND
FrankGehry_1990@1396.80:1409.05 IT'S MADE OF METAL AND THE BROWN STUFF IS FIN PLY IT'S THAT FORMED LUMBER FROM FINLAND WE USED IT AT LOYOLA ON THE CHAPEL AND IT DIDN'T WORK
FrankGehry_1990@1417.63:1422.13 IN CLEVELAND THERE'S BURNHAM MALL
FrankGehry_1990@1422.81:1428.92 ON THE LEFT IT'S NEVER BEEN FINISHED GOING OUT TO THE LAKE YOU CAN SEE ALL
FrankGehry_1990@1431.76:1439.14 AND WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A BUILDING ON THIS SITE THERE'S A RAILROAD TRACK THIS IS THE
FrankGehry_1990@1439.86:1440.73 CITY HALL
FrankGehry_1990@1442.08:1443.53 AND THE COURTHOUSE
FrankGehry_1990@1445.96:1454.18 CENTER LINE OF THE MALL GOES OUT BURNHAM HAD DESIGNED A RAILROAD STATION THAT WAS NEVER BUILT AND SO WE FOLLOWED SOHIO
FrankGehry_1990@1455.05:1461.58 AXIS HERE AND WE FOLLOWED THE AXIS AND THEY'RE TWO KIND OF GOALPOSTS AND THIS IS OUR BUILDING WHICH IS A
FrankGehry_1990@1466.33:1470.49 WE COLLABORATED WITH OLDENBURG AND PUT THE NEWSPAPER ON TOP FOLDED
FrankGehry_1990@1479.59:1482.52 THE GARAGE WITH A C CLAMP FOR
FrankGehry_1990@1506.96:1514.70 IT WOULD START TO WORK WITH THE SCALE OF THE NEW BUILDINGS BY PELLI AND KOHN PEDERSON FOX ET CETERA THAT ARE UNDERWAY
FrankGehry_1990@1526.52:1534.28 IT'S HARD TO DO HIGH RISE I FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE DOWN HERE THIS IS A PIECE OF PROPERTY IN BRENTWOOD
FrankGehry_1990@1536.70:1541.19 A LONG TIME AGO ABOUT EIGHTY TWO OR SOMETHING AFTER MY HOUSE
FrankGehry_1990@1542.31:1550.80 HOUSE FOR MYSELF THAT WOULD BE A VILLAGE OF SEVERAL PAVILIONS AROUND A COURTYARD AND THE
FrankGehry_1990@1551.04:1560.08 OWNER OF THIS LOT WORKED FOR ME AND BUILT THAT ACTUAL MODEL ON THE LEFT AND SHE CAME BACK I GUESS WEALTHIER OR SOMETHING SOMETHING
FrankGehry_1990@1571.34:1573.82 FOLLOWING THAT BASIC IDEA OF THE VILLAGE
FrankGehry_1990@1575.36:1583.96 CHANGED IT AS WE GOT INTO IT I LOCKED THE HOUSE INTO THE SITE BY CUTTING THE BACK END HERE YOU SEE ON THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF
FrankGehry_1990@1585.29:1591.67 SLICING INTO IT AND PUTTING ALL THE BATHROOMS AND DRESSING ROOMS LIKE A RETAINING WALL CREATING A LOWER LEVEL
FrankGehry_1990@1592.38:1599.02 FOR THE MASTER BEDROOM WHICH I DESIGNED LIKE A KIND OF A BARGE LOOKING LIKE A BOAT AND
FrankGehry_1990@1609.55:1614.59 THE DOME WAS A REQUEST FROM THE CLIENT SHE WANTED A DOME SOMEWHERE IN THE HOUSE SHE DIDN'T CARE WHERE
FrankGehry_1990@1615.99:1619.63 WHEN YOU SLEEP IN THIS BEDROOM I HOPE I MEAN I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN
FrankGehry_1990@1621.34:1622.06 OFFERED TO
FrankGehry_1990@1634.11:1643.20 WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT ROOM YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ON A KIND OF BARGE ON SOME KIND OF LAKE AND IT'S VERY PRIVATE THE LANDSCAPE IS BEING BUILT
FrankGehry_1990@1643.89:1651.29 PRIVATE GARDEN AND THEN UP ABOVE THERE'S A GARDEN ON THIS SIDE OF THE LIVING ROOM AND ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE
FrankGehry_1990@1655.73:1657.02 THESE AREN'T FOCUSED VERY WELL
FrankGehry_1990@1660.07:1662.56 DO IT FROM HERE FOCUS THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
FrankGehry_1990@1671.76:1678.98 ANYWAY YOU ENTER INTO A GARDEN WITH A BEAUTIFUL GROVE OF TREES THAT'S THE LIVING ROOM
FrankGehry_1990@1680.32:1687.80 SERVANTS QUARTERS A GUEST BEDROOM WHICH HAS THIS DOME WITH MARBLE ON IT AND THEN YOU ENTER INTO THE LIVING ROOM AND THEN
FrankGehry_1990@1702.47:1707.85 IN THIS SPACE WITH WINDOWS LOOKING OUT ONTO THE
FrankGehry_1990@1708.73:1714.92 THINGS WERE DESIGNED TO GIVE FOREGROUND AND TO CREATE A GREATER DEPTH IN THIS SHALLOW LOT
FrankGehry_1990@1716.02:1719.23 THE MATERIAL IS LEAD COPPER LIKE IN THE BUILDING
FrankGehry_1990@1725.32:1732.79 AND SO IT WAS AN INTENT TO MAKE THIS SMALL PIECE OF LAND IT'S ONE HUNDRED BY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY INTO A KIND OF
FrankGehry_1990@1733.86:1742.88 BY SEPARATING THESE AREAS AND MAKING THE LIVING ROOM AND DINING ROOM INTO THIS PAVILION WITH A HIGH SPACE
FrankGehry_1990@1748.61:1751.97 IN IT AND THIS HAPPENED BY ACCIDENT THAT I GOT THIS RIGHT ON
FrankGehry_1990@1756.81:1758.28 LIKE I GOT A BALDESSARI
FrankGehry_1990@1759.43:1765.32 FREE BUT THE IDEA IS THE WINDOWS ARE ALL PLACED SO YOU SEE PIECES OF THE HOUSE
FrankGehry_1990@1781.09:1781.65 THIS IS FOR
FrankGehry_1990@1784.20:1791.81 MICHAEL EISNER DISNEY WE'RE DOING SOME WORK FOR HIM AND THIS IS IN ANAHEIM CALIFORNIA
FrankGehry_1990@1792.26:1799.87 AND IT'S A FREEWAY BUILDING YOU GO UNDER THIS BRIDGE AT ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR AND THERE'S ANOTHER BRIDGE HERE AND YOU'RE THROUGH THIS ROOM
FrankGehry_1990@1800.72:1810.42 SECOND AND THE BUILDING WILL SORT OF REFLECT THAT ON THE BACK SIDE IT'S MUCH MORE HUMANE ENTRANCE DINING HALL ET CETERA AND THEN THIS
FrankGehry_1990@1810.92:1813.64 THING HERE I'M HOPING AS YOU DRIVE BY
FrankGehry_1990@1814.68:1817.21 PICKET FENCE EFFECT OF THE SOUND
FrankGehry_1990@1824.08:1830.10 I'M DOING A BUILDING IN SWITZERLAND BASEL WHICH IS AN OFFICE BUILDING FOR A FURNITURE COMPANY
FrankGehry_1990@1831.52:1845.31 WE STRUGGLED WITH THE IMAGE THESE ARE THE EARLY STUDIES BUT THEY HAVE TO SELL FURNITURE TO NORMAL PEOPLE SO IF I DID THE BUILDING AND IT WAS TOO FANCY THEN PEOPLE MIGHT SAY WELL THE FURNITURE LOOKS OK IN HIS THING
FrankGehry_1990@1846.63:1854.31 NORMAL BUILDING SO WE'VE MADE A KIND OF PRAGMATIC SLAB IN THE SECOND PHASE HERE AND WE'VE TAKEN THE CONFERENCE FACILITIES
FrankGehry_1990@1856.08:1862.63 SO THAT THE COMMUNAL SPACE IS VERY SCULPTURAL AND SEPARATE AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT FROM THE OFFICES AND
FrankGehry_1990@1868.15:1869.28 THIS IS IN PARIS
FrankGehry_1990@1873.89:1881.56 THE GARE DE LYON OVER HERE THE MINISTER OF FINANCE THE GUY THAT MOVED FROM THE LOUVRE GOES IN HERE THERE'S A NEW LIBRARY ACROSS THE
FrankGehry_1990@1882.47:1889.08 RIVER AND BACK IN HERE IN THIS ALREADY TREED PARK WE'RE DOING A VERY DENSE
FrankGehry_1990@1900.80:1903.18 IT'S A VERY DENSE PROGRAM BOOKSTORES
FrankGehry_1990@1905.17:1910.06 IN A VERY TIGHT SMALL THIS IS THE GROUND LEVEL AND THE FRENCH
FrankGehry_1990@1913.18:1919.06 A BEAUTIFUL SITE AND CUTTING THE CORNER OFF THEY CALL IT THE
FrankGehry_1990@1925.57:1932.46 GET AROUND THE CORNER THESE ARE THE MODELS FOR IT I SHOWED YOU THE OTHER MODEL THE ONE
FrankGehry_1990@1937.23:1941.38 THIS IS THE WAY I ORGANIZED MYSELF SO I COULD MAKE THE DRAWING
FrankGehry_1990@1946.28:1954.93 SO I UNDERSTOOD THE PROBLEM I WAS TRYING TO GET AROUND THIS PLAN COUPE HOW DO YOU DO IT APARTMENTS ET CETERA AND THESE ARE THE KIND
FrankGehry_1990@1965.66:1968.82 BUT OUT OF IT CAME FINALLY THIS RESOLUTION WHERE THE
FrankGehry_1990@1971.01:1971.81 ELEVATOR PIECE
FrankGehry_1990@1972.29:1980.29 WORKED FRONTALLY TO THIS PARALLEL TO THIS STREET AND ALSO PARALLEL TO HERE AND THEN THIS KIND OF TWIST WITH THIS BALCONY AND
FrankGehry_1990@1983.76:1992.64 HER SKIRT TO LET ME INTO THE FOYER THE RESTAURANTS HERE THE APARTMENTS AND THE THEATER ET CETERA SO IT WOULD ALL BE BUILT IN STONE
FrankGehry_1990@1997.44:1999.74 IT FACES INTO A PARK AND THE IDEA WAS
FrankGehry_1990@2007.52:2011.51 ON THE SIDE FACING THE STREET IT'S MUCH MORE NORMAL

FrankGehry_1990@2109.10:2111.27 AND THE HOTEL THAT TONY BAXTER
FrankGehry_1990@2113.71:2115.69 AND THEN THIS IS A KIND OF A SHOPPING MALL
FrankGehry_1990@2121.14:2127.88 ANOTHER RESTAURANT WHAT I DID BECAUSE OF THE PARIS SKIES BEING QUITE DULL I MADE A LIGHT GRID
FrankGehry_1990@2128.41:2135.75 THAT'S PERPENDICULAR TO THE TRAIN STATION TO THE ROUTE OF THE TRAIN IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S KIND OF BEEN THERE AND THEN
FrankGehry_1990@2136.37:2146.67 ALL THESE SIMPLER FORMS INTO IT THE LIGHT GRID WILL HAVE A LIGHT BE LIT UP AT NIGHT AND GIVE A KIND OF LIGHT CEILING
FrankGehry_1990@2155.84:2160.20 IN SWITZERLAND GERMANY ACTUALLY ON THE RHINE ACROSS FROM BASEL
FrankGehry_1990@2160.58:2170.65 A FURNITURE FACTORY AND A FURNITURE MUSEUM AND I TRIED TO THERE'S A NICK GRIMSHAW BUILDING OVER HERE THERE'S AN OLDENBURG SCULPTURE OVER HERE I TRIED TO MAKE
FrankGehry_1990@2171.25:2181.43 A RELATIONSHIP URBANISTICALLY AND I DON'T GAVE GOOD SLIDES TO SHOW IT'S JUST BEEN COMPLETED BUT THIS PIECE HERE IS THIS BUILDING AND THESE PIECES HERE AND HERE AND AS
FrankGehry_1990@2182.00:2189.03 BY IT'S ALWAYS PART YOU SEE IT AS ALL OF THESE PIECES ACCRUE AND BECOME PART OF AN OVERALL
FrankGehry_1990@2199.72:2203.75 YOU WONDER IF THIS IS A MUSEUM WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE INSIDE
FrankGehry_1990@2215.53:2218.53 ON THE OUTSIDE IT DOES SCREAM OUT AT YOU
FrankGehry_1990@2224.08:2235.17 ACTUALLY BASICALLY THREE SQUARE ROOMS WITH A COUPLE OF SKYLIGHTS AND STUFF AND FROM THE BUILDING IN THE BACK YOU SEE IT AS AN ICEBERG FLOATING BY
FrankGehry_1990@2257.30:2260.82 SEE THAT SKYLIGHT GOES DOWN AND BECOMES THAT ONE SO
FrankGehry_1990@2267.69:2275.00 THIS IS THE DISNEY HALL THE CONCERT HALL IT'S A COMPLICATED PROJECT IT HAS
FrankGehry_1990@2276.05:2282.51 CHAMBER HALL IT'S RELATED TO AN EXISTING CHANDLER PAVILION THAT WAS BUILT WITH A LOT OF LOVE AND
FrankGehry_1990@2283.93:2290.79 CARING AND IT'S NOT A GREAT BUILDING BUT I APPROACHED IT OPTIMISTICALLY THAT WE WOULD MAKE A
FrankGehry_1990@2300.93:2313.84 THE PLAN OF THIS IT'S A CONCERT HALL THIS IS THE FOYER WHICH IS KIND OF A GARDEN STRUCTURE THERE'S COMMERCIAL AT THE GROUND FLOOR THESE ARE OFFICES WHICH REALLY IN THE COMPETITION WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DESIGN BUT FINALLY
FrankGehry_1990@2321.06:2328.14 CHANDLER COMPOSING THESE ELEVATIONS TOGETHER AND RELATING THEM TO THE BUILDINGS THAT
FrankGehry_1990@2335.64:2340.82 THE ACOUSTICIAN IN THE COMPETITION GAVE US CRITERIA WHICH LED TO
FrankGehry_1990@2343.00:2346.84 SCHEME WHICH WE FOUND OUT AFTER THE COMPETITION WOULD NOT WORK AT ALL
FrankGehry_1990@2351.55:2357.05 THESE FORMS AND LIKED THE SPACE AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF A COMPETITION YOU HAVE TO THEN TRY AND
FrankGehry_1990@2358.66:2360.45 GET THAT BACK IN SOME WAY
FrankGehry_1990@2362.29:2363.09 WE STUDIED
FrankGehry_1990@2363.70:2368.35 MANY MODELS THIS WAS OUR ORIGINAL MODEL THESE WERE THE THREE
FrankGehry_1990@2369.86:2381.49 BUILDINGS THAT WERE THE IDEAL THE CONCERTGEBOUW BOSTON AND BERLIN EVERYBODY LIKED THE SURROUND ACTUALLY THIS IS THE SMALLEST HALL IN SIZE AND IT HAS MORE SEATS THAN
FrankGehry_1990@2383.43:2388.83 BECAUSE IT HAS DOUBLE BALCONIES OUR CLIENT DOESN'T WANT BALCONIES SO AND WHEN WE MET OUR NEW
FrankGehry_1990@2405.24:2413.66 WE FINALLY SETTLED ON A SHAPE THAT WAS THE PROPORTION OF THE CONCERTGEBOUW WITH THE SLOPING OUTSIDE WALLS WHICH
FrankGehry_1990@2423.00:2433.78 OUR IDEA IS TO MAKE THE SEATING CARRIAGE VERY SCULPTURAL AND OUT OF WOOD AND LIKE A BIG BOAT SITTING IN THIS PLASTER ROOM THAT'S THE IDEA
FrankGehry_1990@2438.19:2439.99 THE CORNERS WOULD HAVE SKYLIGHTS
FrankGehry_1990@2443.01:2447.85 THESE COLUMNS WOULD BE STRUCTURAL AND THE NICE THING ABOUT INTRODUCING COLUMNS IS THEY GIVE YOU
FrankGehry_1990@2449.66:2454.30 FROM WHEREVER YOU SIT AND CREATE INTIMACY NOW THIS IS NOT A
FrankGehry_1990@2456.70:2463.11 ON THE WAY TO BEING AND SO I WOULDN'T TAKE IT LITERALLY EXCEPT THE FEELING OF
FrankGehry_1990@2464.48:2467.14 WE STUDIED THE ACOUSTICS WITH LASER
FrankGehry_1990@2468.14:2474.52 STUFF AND THEY BOUNCE THEM OFF THIS AND SEE WHERE IT ALL WORKS BUT YOU GET THE SENSE OF THE HALL IN SECTION
FrankGehry_1990@2475.80:2482.19 MOST HALLS COME STRAIGHT DOWN INTO A PROSCENIUM IN THIS CASE WE'RE OPENING IT BACK UP
FrankGehry_1990@2482.88:2488.29 AND GETTING SKYLIGHTS IN THE FOUR CORNERS AND SO IT WILL BE QUITE A DIFFERENT SHAPE
FrankGehry_1990@2493.65:2498.62 THE ORIGINAL BUILDING BECAUSE IT WAS FROG
FrankGehry_1990@2498.82:2508.26 LIKE FIT NICELY ON THE SITE AND CRANKED ITSELF WELL WHEN YOU GET INTO A BOX IT'S HARDER TO DO IT AND HERE WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOW TO PUT THE HOTEL IN AND THIS IS A
FrankGehry_1990@2512.61:2525.42 BUT THIS IS HOW I DO WORK I DO TAKE PIECES AND BITS AND LOOK AT IT AND STRUGGLE WITH IT AND CUT IT AWAY AND OF COURSE IT'S NOT GOING TO LOOK LIKE THAT BUT IT IS THE CRAZY WAY I TEND TO
FrankGehry_1990@2527.06:2529.63 AND THEN FINALLY IN L A
FrankGehry_1990@2549.64:2558.85 LARRY 'S PUTTING SOME WATER IN THERE AND IT WORKS MUCH BETTER THAN A FISH IN BARCELONA I WAS ASKED TO DO A FISH AND WE'RE WORKING ON
FrankGehry_1990@2559.94:2568.82 AT THE FOOT OF RITZ CARLTON TOWER BEING DONE BY SKIDMORE OWINGS AND MERRILL AND THE RITZ CARLTON TOWER IS BEING DESIGNED WITH EXPOSED STEEL NON FIRE
FrankGehry_1990@2570.30:2580.79 MUCH LIKE THOSE OLD GAS TANKS AND SO WE TOOK THE LANGUAGE OF THIS EXPOSED STEEL AND USED IT PERVERTED IT INTO THE FORM OF THE
FrankGehry_1990@2585.64:2598.65 CREATED A KIND OF A NINETEENTH CENTURY CONTRAPTION THAT LOOKS LIKE THAT WILL SIT THIS IS THE BEACH AND THE HARBOR OUT IN FRONT AND THIS IS REALLY A SHOPPING CENTER WITH DEPARTMENT STORES AND WE SPLIT THESE BRIDGES
FrankGehry_1990@2599.18:2601.18 ORIGINALLY THIS WAS ALL SOLID WITH A HOLE IN
FrankGehry_1990@2603.27:2606.64 SEVERAL BRIDGES AND CREATED A KIND OF FOREGROUND
FrankGehry_1990@2608.77:2610.68 TO THE HOTEL PEOPLE THE OTHER DAY
FrankGehry_1990@2613.08:2615.35 TERRIFIED AND SAID THAT NOBODY
FrankGehry_1990@2619.29:2620.33 BECAUSE OF THIS FISH
FrankGehry_1990@2630.24:2632.14 FINALLY I JUST THREW THESE IN LOU DANZIGER I
FrankGehry_1990@2640.39:2642.42 SADLY FOR SALE TIME GOES ON

FrankGehry_1990@2649.50:2657.28 FAST FOOD THING HE DESIGNED THE ROBOT AS THE CASHIER AND THE HEAD MOVES AND I DID THE REST OF IT AND THE FOOD WASN'T AS GOOD AS THE
FrankGehry_1990@2660.02:2664.70 SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE OTHER WAY AROUND THE FOOD SHOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FIRST IT DIDN'T WORK THANK YOU VERY MUCH
