PhilHansen_2013@13.37:18.36 WHEN I WAS IN ART SCHOOL I DEVELOPED A SHAKE IN MY HAND AND THIS WAS THE STRAIGHTEST LINE I COULD DRAW
PhilHansen_2013@18.96:24.92 NOW IN HINDSIGHT IT WAS ACTUALLY GOOD FOR SOME THINGS LIKE MIXING A CAN OF PAINT OR SHAKING A POLAROID
PhilHansen_2013@25.1:30.46 BUT AT THE TIME THIS WAS REALLY DOOMSDAY THIS WAS THE DESTRUCTION OF MY DREAM OF BECOMING AN ARTIST
PhilHansen_2013@31.19:32.77 THE SHAKE DEVELOPED OUT OF
PhilHansen_2013@33.21:37.83 REALLY A SINGLE MINDED PURSUIT OF POINTILLISM JUST YEARS OF MAKING TINY TINY DOTS
PhilHansen_2013@37.97:40.31 AND EVENTUALLY THESE DOTS WENT FROM
PhilHansen_2013@40.53:44.92 BEING PERFECTLY ROUND TO LOOKING MORE LIKE TADPOLES BECAUSE OF THE SHAKE
PhilHansen_2013@45.49:51.93 SO TO COMPENSATE I 'D HOLD THE PEN TIGHTER AND THIS PROGRESSIVELY MADE THE SHAKE WORSE SO I 'D HOLD THE PEN TIGHTER STILL
PhilHansen_2013@52.25:58.36 AND THIS BECAME A VICIOUS CYCLE THAT ENDED UP CAUSING SO MUCH PAIN AND JOINT ISSUES I HAD TROUBLE HOLDING ANYTHING
PhilHansen_2013@64.41:66.19 AND THEN I LEFT ART COMPLETELY
PhilHansen_2013@67.23:74.16 BUT AFTER A FEW YEARS I JUST COULDN 'T STAY AWAY FROM ART AND I DECIDED TO GO TO A NEUROLOGIST ABOUT THE SHAKE AND DISCOVERED I HAD PERMANENT NERVE DAMAGE
PhilHansen_2013@80.65:87.33 SO I DID I WENT HOME I GRABBED A PENCIL AND I JUST STARTED LETTING MY HAND SHAKE AND SHAKE I WAS MAKING ALL THESE SCRIBBLE PICTURES
PhilHansen_2013@87.6:91.48 AND EVEN THOUGH IT WASN 'T THE KIND OF ART THAT I WAS ULTIMATELY PASSIONATE ABOUT
PhilHansen_2013@97.59:100.8 I JUST HAD TO FIND A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO MAKING THE ART THAT I WANTED
PhilHansen_2013@101.17:108.12 NOW I STILL ENJOYED THE FRAGMENTATION OF POINTILLISM SEEING THESE LITTLE TINY DOTS COME TOGETHER TO MAKE THIS UNIFIED WHOLE
PhilHansen_2013@108.14:116.11 SO I BEGAN EXPERIMENTING WITH OTHER WAYS TO FRAGMENT IMAGES WHERE THE SHAKE WOULDN 'T AFFECT THE WORK LIKE DIPPING MY FEET IN PAINT AND WALKING ON A CANVAS
PhilHansen_2013@117.73:123.56 OR IN A THREE D STRUCTURE CONSISTING OF TWO BY FOURS CREATING A TWO D IMAGE
PhilHansen_2013@123.73:125.66 BY BURNING IT WITH A BLOWTORCH
PhilHansen_2013@126.76:132.21 I DISCOVERED THAT IF I WORKED ON A LARGER SCALE AND WITH BIGGER MATERIALS MY HAND REALLY WOULDN 'T HURT
PhilHansen_2013@132.43:136.19 AND AFTER HAVING GONE FROM A SINGLE APPROACH TO ART
PhilHansen_2013@136.4:141.41 I ENDED UP HAVING AN APPROACH TO CREATIVITY THAT COMPLETELY CHANGED MY ARTISTIC HORIZONS
PhilHansen_2013@141.98:148.61 THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I 'D ENCOUNTERED THIS IDEA THAT EMBRACING A LIMITATION COULD ACTUALLY DRIVE CREATIVITY
PhilHansen_2013@158.55:163.45 I FELT LIKE I COULD DO SO MUCH MORE WITH THE SUPPLIES I THOUGHT AN ARTIST WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE
PhilHansen_2013@164.07:170.43 I ACTUALLY DIDN 'T EVEN HAVE A REGULAR PAIR OF SCISSORS I WAS USING THESE METAL SHEARS UNTIL I STOLE A PAIR FROM THE OFFICE THAT I WORKED AT
PhilHansen_2013@182.21:185.45 REALLY TRY TO CREATE SOMETHING JUST COMPLETELY OUTSIDE OF THE BOX
PhilHansen_2013@185.95:187.73 BUT I SAT THERE FOR HOURS
PhilHansen_2013@187.99:189.64 AND NOTHING CAME TO MIND
PhilHansen_2013@190.53:193.21 THE SAME THING THE NEXT DAY AND THEN THE NEXT
PhilHansen_2013@193.29:195.64 QUICKLY SLIPPING INTO A CREATIVE SLUMP
PhilHansen_2013@196.91:201.24 AND I WAS IN A DARK PLACE FOR A LONG TIME UNABLE TO CREATE
PhilHansen_2013@201.33:207.01 AND IT DIDN 'T MAKE ANY SENSE BECAUSE I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO SUPPORT MY ART AND YET I WAS CREATIVELY BLANK
PhilHansen_2013@208.04:215.13 BUT AS I SEARCHED AROUND IN THE DARKNESS I REALIZED I WAS ACTUALLY PARALYZED BY ALL OF THE CHOICES THAT I NEVER HAD BEFORE
PhilHansen_2013@216.12:219.52 AND IT WAS THEN THAT I THOUGHT BACK TO MY JITTERY HANDS
PhilHansen_2013@220.23:221.79 EMBRACE THE SHAKE
PhilHansen_2013@222.66:228.78 AND I REALIZED IF I EVER WANTED MY CREATIVITY BACK I HAD TO QUIT TRYING SO HARD TO THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX
PhilHansen_2013@236.73:240.13 WHAT IF I COULD ONLY CREATE WITH A DOLLAR 'S WORTH OF SUPPLIES
PhilHansen_2013@259.68:262.94 IT REALLY BECAME A MOMENT OF CLARIFICATION FOR ME THAT
PhilHansen_2013@262.98:264.99 WE NEED TO FIRST BE LIMITED
PhilHansen_2013@265.23:267.21 IN ORDER TO BECOME LIMITLESS
PhilHansen_2013@267.88:274.67 I TOOK THIS APPROACH OF THINKING INSIDE THE BOX TO MY CANVAS AND WONDERED WHAT IF INSTEAD OF PAINTING ON A CANVAS I COULD ONLY PAINT ON MY CHEST
PhilHansen_2013@275.7:282.28 SO I PAINTED THIRTY IMAGES ONE LAYER AT A TIME ONE ON TOP OF ANOTHER WITH EACH PICTURE REPRESENTING AN INFLUENCE IN MY LIFE
PhilHansen_2013@283.73:288.11 OR WHAT IF INSTEAD OF PAINTING WITH A BRUSH I COULD ONLY PAINT WITH KARATE CHOPS
PhilHansen_2013@310.05:319.43 SO FOR SIX DAYS I LIVED IN FRONT OF A WEBCAM I SLEPT ON THE FLOOR AND I ATE TAKEOUT AND I ASKED PEOPLE TO CALL ME AND SHARE A STORY WITH ME ABOUT A LIFE CHANGING MOMENT
PhilHansen_2013@320.24:325.13 THEIR STORIES BECAME THE ART AS I WROTE THEM ONTO THE REVOLVING CANVAS
PhilHansen_2013@341.96:349.89 THIS DESTRUCTION IDEA TURNED INTO A YEARLONG PROJECT THAT I CALLED GOODBYE ART WHERE EACH AND EVERY PIECE OF ART HAD TO BE DESTROYED AFTER ITS CREATION
PhilHansen_2013@350.54:357.15 IN THE BEGINNING OF GOODBYE ART I FOCUSED ON FORCED DESTRUCTION LIKE THIS IMAGE OF JIMI HENDRIX MADE WITH OVER SEVEN THOUSAND MATCHES
PhilHansen_2013@365.01:366.65 LIKE SPITTING OUT FOOD
PhilHansen_2013@374.05:376.33 AND EVEN FROZEN WINE
PhilHansen_2013@378.22:391.76 THE LAST ITERATION OF DESTRUCTION WAS TO TRY TO PRODUCE SOMETHING THAT DIDN 'T ACTUALLY EXIST IN THE FIRST PLACE SO I ORGANIZED CANDLES ON A TABLE I LIT THEM AND THEN BLEW THEM OUT THEN REPEATED THIS PROCESS OVER AND OVER WITH THE SAME SET OF CANDLES
PhilHansen_2013@391.79:395.23 THEN ASSEMBLED THE VIDEOS INTO THE LARGER IMAGE
PhilHansen_2013@395.67:399.62 SO THE END IMAGE WAS NEVER VISIBLE AS A PHYSICAL WHOLE
PhilHansen_2013@399.99:402.48 IT WAS DESTROYED BEFORE IT EVER EXISTED
PhilHansen_2013@404.42:412.16 IN THE COURSE OF THIS GOODBYE ART SERIES I CREATED TWENTY THREE DIFFERENT PIECES WITH NOTHING LEFT TO PHYSICALLY DISPLAY
PhilHansen_2013@412.53:415.28 WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE LIMITATION
PhilHansen_2013@415.32:417.94 ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE THE ULTIMATE LIBERATION
PhilHansen_2013@417.95:426.09 AS EACH TIME I CREATED THE DESTRUCTION BROUGHT ME BACK TO A NEUTRAL PLACE WHERE I FELT REFRESHED AND READY TO START THE NEXT PROJECT
PhilHansen_2013@426.3:435.77 IT DID NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT THERE WERE TIMES WHEN MY PROJECTS FAILED TO GET OFF THE GROUND OR EVEN WORSE AFTER SPENDING TONS OF TIME ON THEM THE END IMAGE WAS KIND OF EMBARRASSING
PhilHansen_2013@436.1:443.05 BUT HAVING COMMITTED TO THE PROCESS I CONTINUED ON AND SOMETHING REALLY SURPRISING CAME OUT OF THIS AS I DESTROYED EACH PROJECT
PhilHansen_2013@443.79:445.65 I WAS LEARNING TO LET GO
PhilHansen_2013@446.54:448.48 LET GO OF OUTCOMES
PhilHansen_2013@448.87:452.22 LET GO OF FAILURES AND LET GO OF IMPERFECTIONS
PhilHansen_2013@452.64:456.59 AND IN RETURN I FOUND A PROCESS OF CREATING ART THAT 'S PERPETUAL
PhilHansen_2013@459.23:463.27 I FOUND MYSELF IN A STATE OF CONSTANT CREATION THINKING ONLY OF WHAT 'S NEXT
PhilHansen_2013@463.69:466.02 AND COMING UP WITH MORE IDEAS THAN EVER
PhilHansen_2013@466.68:469.24 WHEN I THINK BACK TO MY THREE YEARS AWAY FROM ART
PhilHansen_2013@469.54:471.97 AWAY FROM MY DREAM JUST GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS
PhilHansen_2013@472.69:476.17 INSTEAD OF TRYING TO FIND A DIFFERENT WAY TO CONTINUE THAT DREAM
PhilHansen_2013@476.7:478.72 I JUST QUIT I GAVE UP
PhilHansen_2013@479.73:482.53 AND WHAT IF I DIDN 'T EMBRACE THE SHAKE
PhilHansen_2013@483.1:488.94 BECAUSE EMBRACING THE SHAKE FOR ME WASN 'T JUST ABOUT ART AND HAVING ART SKILLS IT TURNED OUT TO BE ABOUT LIFE
PhilHansen_2013@489.1:490.69 AND HAVING LIFE SKILLS
PhilHansen_2013@499.49:503.21 LEARNING TO BE CREATIVE WITHIN THE CONFINES OF OUR LIMITATIONS
PhilHansen_2013@503.57:506.86 IS THE BEST HOPE WE HAVE TO TRANSFORM OURSELVES
PhilHansen_2013@507.41:510.29 AND COLLECTIVELY TRANSFORM OUR WORLD
PhilHansen_2013@511.74:515.13 LOOKING AT LIMITATIONS AS A SOURCE OF CREATIVITY
PhilHansen_2013@518.26:522.5 NOW WHEN I RUN INTO A BARRIER OR I FIND MYSELF CREATIVELY STUMPED
PhilHansen_2013@530.15:533.71 LIKE USING HUNDREDS OF REAL LIVE WORMS TO MAKE AN IMAGE
PhilHansen_2013@534.84:537.26 USING A PUSHPIN TO TATTOO A BANANA
PhilHansen_2013@539.8:543.1 OR PAINTING A PICTURE WITH HAMBURGER GREASE
PhilHansen_2013@555.55:560.67 LIMITATIONS MAY BE THE MOST UNLIKELY OF PLACES TO HARNESS CREATIVITY
PhilHansen_2013@566.42:569.38 RETHINK CATEGORIES AND CHALLENGE ACCEPTED NORMS
PhilHansen_2013@569.99:573.55 AND INSTEAD OF TELLING EACH OTHER TO SEIZE THE DAY
