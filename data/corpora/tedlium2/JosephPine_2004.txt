JosephPine_2004 A VERY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE THAT IS GOING ON IN THE VERY FABRIC OF THE MODERN ECONOMY AND TO TALK ABOUT THAT I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING
JosephPine_2004 BECAUSE IN THE BEGINNING WERE
JosephPine_2004 BUT THEN ALONG CAME THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
JosephPine_2004 WELL WHAT THEN HAPPENED OVER THE LAST FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS IS THAT GOODS HAVE BECOME COMMODITIZED
JosephPine_2004 THEY JUST CARE ABOUT THREE THINGS AND THREE THINGS ONLY PRICE PRICE AND PRICE
JosephPine_2004 NOW THERE'S AN ANTIDOTE TO COMMODITIZATION AND THAT IS CUSTOMIZATION
JosephPine_2004 MY FIRST BOOK WAS CALLED MASS CUSTOMIZATION IT CAME UP A COUPLE OF TIMES YESTERDAY AND HOW I DISCOVERED THIS PROGRESSION OF ECONOMIC VALUE WAS REALIZING THAT CUSTOMIZING A GOOD
JosephPine_2004 THE PAST TEN OR TWENTY YEARS WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT SERVICES ARE BEING COMMODITIZED AS WELL
JosephPine_2004 LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE SERVICE SOLD ON PRICE PRICE PRICE FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS WITH ALL THEIR VALUE PRICING
JosephPine_2004 WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IT'S TIME TO MOVE TO A NEW LEVEL OF ECONOMIC VALUE TIME TO GO BEYOND THE GOODS AND THE SERVICES
JosephPine_2004 AND USE IN THAT SAME HEURISTIC WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CUSTOMIZE A SERVICE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DESIGN A SERVICE THAT IS SO APPROPRIATE FOR A PARTICULAR PERSON THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED AT THIS
JosephPine_2004 IN TIME THEN YOU CAN'T HELP BUT MAKE THEM GO WOW YOU CAN'T HELP BUT TURN IT INTO A MEMORABLE EVENT YOU CAN'T HELP BUT TURN IT INTO AN EXPERIENCE
JosephPine_2004 SO WE'RE SHIFTING TO AN EXPERIENCE ECONOMY WHERE EXPERIENCES ARE BECOMING THE PREDOMINANT ECONOMIC OFFERING NOW MOST PLACES THAT I TALK TO WHEN I TALK ABOUT EXPERIENCE I TALK ABOUT DISNEY
JosephPine_2004 THE WORLD 'S PREMIER EXPERIENCE STAGER I TALK ABOUT THEME RESTAURANTS AND EXPERIENTIAL RETAIL AND BOUTIQUE HOTELS AND LAS VEGAS THE EXPERIENCE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD
JosephPine_2004 BUT HERE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT EXPERIENCES THINK ABOUT THOMAS DOLBY AND HIS GROUP PLAYING MUSIC
JosephPine_2004 THINK ABOUT MEANINGFUL PLACES
JosephPine_2004 THINK ABOUT DRINKING WINE ABOUT A JOURNEY TO THE CLOCK OF THE LONG NOW THOSE ARE ALL EXPERIENCES THINK ABOUT TED ITSELF
JosephPine_2004 THE EXPERIENCE CAPITAL IN THE WORLD OF CONFERENCES
JosephPine_2004 ALL OF THESE ARE EXPERIENCES
JosephPine_2004 AND THE QUESTION ISN'T REALLY SO MUCH A QUESTION AS AN ACCUSATION
JosephPine_2004 AND THE DUTCH WHEN THEY USUALLY PUT IT IT ALWAYS STARTS WITH THE SAME TWO WORDS YOU KNOW THE WORDS I MEAN
JosephPine_2004 WE LIKE REAL
JosephPine_2004 SO MUCH HAS THAT HAPPENED THAT I'VE DEVELOPED A FAIRLY PRATICED RESPONSE WHICH IS
JosephPine_2004 I POINT OUT THAT FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN INAUTHENTIC EXPERIENCE
JosephPine_2004 WHY BECAUSE THE EXPERIENCE HAPPENS INSIDE OF US IT'S OUR REACTION TO THE EVENTS THAT ARE STAGED IN FRONT OF US
JosephPine_2004 SO AS LONG AS WE ARE IN ANY SENSE AUTHENTIC HUMAN BEINGS THEN EVERY EXPERIENCE WE HAVE IS AUTHENTIC
JosephPine_2004 NOW THERE MAY BE MORE OR LESS NATURAL OR ARTIFICIAL STIMULI FOR THE EXPERIENCE BUT EVEN THAT IS A MATTER OF DEGREE NOT
JosephPine_2004 THERE IS A COMPANY THAT MANUFACTURED THE CAR THAT DELIVERED YOU TO THE EDGE OF THE WOODS THERE'S A COMPANY THAT MANUFACTURED THE SHOES THAT YOU HAVE TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE GROUND OF THE WOODS THERE'S A COMPANY THAT PROVIDES A CELL PHONE SERVICE YOU HAVE IN CASE YOU GET LOST IN THE WOODS
JosephPine_2004 ALL OF THOSE ARE MAN MADE ARTIFICIALITY BROUGHT INTO THE WOODS BY YOU AND BY THE VERY NATURE OF BEING THERE
JosephPine_2004 BUT NONETHELESS NOT JUST THE DUTCH BUT EVERYONE HAS THIS DESIRE FOR THE AUTHENTIC AND AUTHENTICITY IS THEREFORE BECOMING THE NEW CONSUMER SENSIBILITY
JosephPine_2004 YOU CAN LOOK AT HOW EACH OF THESE ECONOMIES DEVELOPED THAT EACH ONE HAS THEIR OWN BUSINESS IMPERATIVE MATCHED WITH A CONSUMER SENSIBILITY WE'RE THE AGRARIAN ECONOMY AND WE'RE SUPPLYING COMMODITIES IT'S ABOUT SUPPLY AND AVAILABILITY GETTING THE COMMODITIES TO MARKET
JosephPine_2004 GETTING THE COSTS DOWN AS LOW AS POSSIBLE SO WE CAN OFFER THEM TO THE MASSES
JosephPine_2004 WITH THE SERVICE ECONOMY IT IS ABOUT
JosephPine_2004 IMPROVING QUALITY
JosephPine_2004 THAT HAS THE WHOLE QUALITY MOVEMENT HAS RISEN WITH THE SERVICE ECONOMY OVER THE PAST TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS AND NOW WITH THE EXPERIENCE ECONOMY IT'S ABOUT RENDERING AUTHENTICITY
JosephPine_2004 RENDERING AUTHENTICITY AND THE KEYWORD IS RENDERING
JosephPine_2004 RIGHT RENDERING BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR CONSUMERS AS BUSINESS PEOPLE TO PERCIEVE YOUR OFFERINGS AS AUTHENTIC
JosephPine_2004 THERE IS A BASIC PARADOX
JosephPine_2004 NO ONE CAN HAVE AN INAUTHENTIC EXPERIENCE
JosephPine_2004 BUT NO BUSINESS CAN SUPPLY ONE
JosephPine_2004 BECAUSE ALL BUSINESSES ARE MAN MADE OBJECTS ALL BUSINESS IS INVOLVED WITH MONEY ALL BUSINESS IS A MATTER OF USING MACHINERY
JosephPine_2004 AND ALL THOSE THINGS MAKE SOMETHING
JosephPine_2004 RENDERING AUTHENTICITY
JosephPine_2004 AT WHICH AUTHENTICITY ENTERED THE LEXICON IF YOU WILL
JosephPine_2004 AND THAT IS TO NO SURPRISE IN SHAKESPEARE
JosephPine_2004 AND IN HIS PLAY HAMLET
JosephPine_2004 SAYS SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY REAL
JosephPine_2004 AND THIS ABOVE ALL
JosephPine_2004 TO THINE OWN SELF BE TRUE
JosephPine_2004 THAT THOU CANST NOT THEN BE FALSE TO
JosephPine_2004 AND THOSE THREE VERSES ARE THE CORE OF AUTHENTICITY
JosephPine_2004 THERE ARE TWO DIMENSIONS TO AUTHENTICITY ONE BEING TRUE TO YOURSELF WHICH IS VERY SELF DIRECTED
JosephPine_2004 OTHER DIRECTED BEING WHAT YOU SAY YOU ARE TO OTHERS
JosephPine_2004 LIKE THAT
JosephPine_2004 YOU THINK ABOUT THAT YOU DO IN FACT GET A TWO BY TWO
JosephPine_2004 WHERE ON ONE DIMENSION IT'S A MATTER OF BEING TRUE TO YOURSELF AS BUSINESSES ARE THE ECONOMIC OFFERINGS YOU ARE PROVIDING ARE THEY TRUE TO THEMSELVES
JosephPine_2004 AND THE OTHER DIMENSION IS ARE THEY WHAT THEY SAY THEY ARE TO OTHERS
JosephPine_2004 YOU HAVE IS NOT TRUE TO ITSELF AND IS NOT WHAT IT SAYS IT IS
JosephPine_2004 YIELDING A TWO BY TWO MATRIX AND OF COURSE IF YOU ARE BOTH TRUE TO YOURSELF AND ARE WHAT YOU SAY YOU ARE THEN YOU'RE REAL REAL
JosephPine_2004 THE OPPOSITE OF COURSE IS
JosephPine_2004 A GENERAL RULE IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT
JosephPine_2004 IF YOU DO LIKE IT IT'S
JosephPine_2004 NOW THE OTHER TWO SIDES
JosephPine_2004 OF THE COIN ARE BEING A REAL FAKE
JosephPine_2004 IS WHAT IT SAYS IT IS BUT IS NOT TRUE TO ITSELF OR BEING A FAKE REAL
JosephPine_2004 TRUE TO ITSELF BUT NOT WHAT IT SAYS IT IS YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THOSE TWO YOU KNOW BOTH OF THESE BETTER THAN BEING FAKE FAKE NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS BEING REAL REAL YOU CAN CONTRAST THEM BY THINKING ABOUT
JosephPine_2004 RIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE BEHIND THE FACADE RIGHT IT IS WHAT IT SAYS IT IS IT'S UNIVERSAL STUDIO IT'S IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES YOU'RE GOING TO WALK A LOT RIGHT YOU DON'T TEND TO WALK A LOT IN LOS ANGELES WELL HERE 'S A PLACE WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO WALK A LOT OUTSIDE IN THIS CITY
JosephPine_2004 BUT IS IT REALLY TRUE TO ITSELF
JosephPine_2004 IS IT REALLY IN THE CITY IS
JosephPine_2004 YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ALL OF IT AND SEE WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE FACADES OF IT SO SHE CALLS IT A REAL FAKE
JosephPine_2004 DISNEY WORLD ON THE OTHER HAND IS A FAKE REAL OR A FAKE REALITY
JosephPine_2004 BUT IT IS
JosephPine_2004 WE WON 'T TALK ABOUT SANTA CLAUS
JosephPine_2004 BUT DISNEY WORLD IS WONDERFULLY TRUE TO ITSELF RIGHT JUST WONDERFULLY TRUE TO ITSELF WHEN YOU ARE THERE YOU ARE JUST IMMERSED IN THIS WONDERFUL ENVIRONMENT
JosephPine_2004 SO IT'S A FAKE REAL
JosephPine_2004 NOW THE EASIEST WAY
JosephPine_2004 TO FALL DOWN IN THIS AND NOT BE REAL REAL RIGHT THE EASIEST WAY NOT TO BE TRUE TO YOURSELF IS NOT TO UNDERSTAND YOUR HERITAGE
JosephPine_2004 AND THEREBY REPUDIATE THAT HERITAGE
JosephPine_2004 TO UNDERSTAND THAT
JosephPine_2004 THINK ABOUT DISNEY AGAIN
JosephPine_2004 TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO RIGHT THE DISNEY THE COMPANY THAT IS PROBABLY BEST KNOWN FOR FAMILY VALUES OUT THERE DISNEY BOUGHT THE ABC NETWORK
JosephPine_2004 THE T A NETWORK THEN IT BOUGHT MIRAMAX KNOWN FOR ITS NC SEVENTEEN FARE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN FAMILIES EVERYWHERE COULDN'T REALLY TRUST WHAT THEY WERE GETTING FROM DISNEY IT WAS NO LONGER TRUE TO ITS HERITAGE
JosephPine_2004 NO LONGER TRUE TO WALT DISNEY THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY'RE HAVING SUCH TROUBLE TODAY AND WHY ROY DISNEY IS OUT TO GET MICHAEL EISNER
JosephPine_2004 BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER TRUE TO ITSELF
JosephPine_2004 WHEN IT COMES TO BEING WHAT YOU SAY YOU ARE THE EASIEST MISTAKE THAT COMPANIES MAKE IS THAT THEY ADVERTISE THINGS THAT THEY ARE NOT
JosephPine_2004 THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE PERCEIVED AS FAKE AS A PHONY COMPANY ADVERTIZING THINGS THAT YOU'RE NOT THINK ABOUT ANY HOTEL ANY AIRLINE ANY HOSPITAL
JosephPine_2004 BUT UNFORTUNATELY YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THE ACTUAL HOTEL AIRLINE AND HOSPITAL AND THEN YOU HAVE THAT DISCONNECT THEN YOU HAVE THAT PERCEPTION THAT YOU ARE PHONY
JosephPine_2004 SO THE NUMBER ONE THING TO DO WHEN IT COMES TO BEING WHAT YOU SAY YOU ARE
JosephPine_2004 IS TO PROVIDE PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE WHO YOU ARE
JosephPine_2004 FOR PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE WHO YOU ARE
JosephPine_2004 NOT ADVERTISING DOES IT THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE COMPANIES LIKE STARBUCKS
JosephPine_2004 THAT DOESN'T ADVERTISE AT ALL THEY SAID YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO WE ARE YOU HAVE TO COME EXPERIENCE US
JosephPine_2004 AND THINK ABOUT THE ECONOMIC VALUE THEY HAVE PROVIDED BY THAT EXPERIENCE
JosephPine_2004 RIGHT COFFEE AT ITS CORE IS WHAT
JosephPine_2004 IT'S BEANS RIGHT IT'S COFFEE BEANS YOU KNOW HOW MUCH COFFEE IS WORTH WHEN TREATED AS A COMMODITY AS
JosephPine_2004 TWO OR THREE CENTS PER CUP THAT'S WHAT COFFEE IS WORTH
JosephPine_2004 BUT GRIND IT ROAST IT PACKAGE IT PUT IT ON A GROCERY STORE SHELF AND NOW IT'LL COST FIVE TEN FIFTEEN CENTS WHEN YOU TREAT IT AS A GOOD
JosephPine_2004 TAKE THAT SAME GOOD AND PERFORM THE SERVICE OF ACTUALLY BREWING IT FOR A CUSTOMER IN A CORNER DINER IN A BODEGA A KIOSK SOMEWHERE YOU GET FIFTY CENTS MAYBE A BUCK PER CUP OF COFFEE
JosephPine_2004 BUT SURROUND THE BREWING OF THAT COFFEE WITH THE AMBIANCE OF A STARBUCKS WITH THE AUTHENTIC CEDAR THAT GOES INSIDE OF THERE AND NOW BECAUSE OF THAT AUTHENTIC EXPERIENCE YOU CAN CHARGE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE DOLLARS
JosephPine_2004 FOR A CUP OF COFFEE
JosephPine_2004 SO AUTHENTICITY IS BECOMING THE NEW CONSUMER SENSIBILITY LET ME SUMMARIZE IT FOR THE BUSINESS PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WITH THREE RULES THREE BASIC RULES
JosephPine_2004 ONE DON'T SAY YOU'RE AUTHENTIC
JosephPine_2004 IT'S EASIER TO BE AUTHENTIC IF YOU DON'T SAY YOU'RE AUTHENTIC
JosephPine_2004 AND THREE IF YOU SAY YOU'RE AUTHENTIC
JosephPine_2004 YOU BETTER BE AUTHENTIC
JosephPine_2004 WHAT WE WHAT WILL MAKE US HAPPY
JosephPine_2004 SATISFYING THE DESIRE FOR AUTHENTICITY THANK YOU
