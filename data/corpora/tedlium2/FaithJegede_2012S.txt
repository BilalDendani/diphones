FaithJegede_2012S AND VERY HANDSOME HE 'S SPEECHLESS BUT HE COMMUNICATES JOY IN A WAY THAT SOME OF THE BEST ORATORS CANNOT
FaithJegede_2012S WHEN HE SINGS SONGS FROM OUR CHILDHOOD ATTEMPTING WORDS THAT NOT EVEN I COULD REMEMBER HE REMINDS ME OF ONE THING HOW LITTLE WE KNOW ABOUT THE MIND AND HOW WONDERFUL THE UNKNOWN MUST BE
FaithJegede_2012S BUT WHAT LIFTED MY HEART AND STRENGTHENED MY SOUL WAS THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS THE CASE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NOT SEEN AS ORDINARY THIS COULD ONLY MEAN ONE THING THAT THEY WERE EXTRAORDINARY
FaithJegede_2012S AUTISTIC AND EXTRAORDINARY NOW
FaithJegede_2012S AND ACROSS THE WORLD EVERY TWENTY MINUTES ONE NEW PERSON IS DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM
FaithJegede_2012S AND ALTHOUGH IT 'S ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS IN THE WORLD THERE IS NO KNOWN CAUSE OR CURE
FaithJegede_2012S AND I CANNOT REMEMBER THE FIRST MOMENT I ENCOUNTERED AUTISM BUT I CANNOT RECALL A DAY WITHOUT IT I WAS JUST THREE YEARS OLD WHEN MY BROTHER CAME ALONG AND I WAS SO EXCITED
FaithJegede_2012S THAT I HAD A NEW BEING IN MY LIFE AND AFTER A FEW MONTHS WENT BY I REALIZED THAT HE WAS DIFFERENT HE SCREAMED A LOT
FaithJegede_2012S HE DIDN 'T WANT TO PLAY LIKE THE OTHER BABIES DID AND IN FACT HE DIDN 'T SEEM VERY INTERESTED IN ME WHATSOEVER
FaithJegede_2012S AND AS HE GREW OLDER HE GREW MORE DIFFERENT AND THE DIFFERENCES BECAME MORE OBVIOUS YET BEYOND THE TANTRUMS AND THE FRUSTRATION AND THE NEVER ENDING HYPERACTIVITY WAS SOMETHING REALLY UNIQUE
FaithJegede_2012S A PURE AND INNOCENT NATURE A BOY WHO SAW THE WORLD WITHOUT PREJUDICE A HUMAN WHO HAD NEVER LIED
FaithJegede_2012S EXTRAORDINARY
FaithJegede_2012S NOW I CANNOT DENY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CHALLENGING MOMENTS IN MY FAMILY MOMENTS WHERE I 'VE WISHED THAT THEY WERE JUST LIKE ME
FaithJegede_2012S YOU CAN BE EXTRAORDINARY
FaithJegede_2012S BECAUSE AUTISTIC OR NOT THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE HAVE WE 'VE GOT A GIFT EVERYONE 'S GOT A GIFT INSIDE OF US
FaithJegede_2012S AND IN ALL HONESTY THE PURSUIT OF NORMALITY IS THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE OF POTENTIAL THE CHANCE FOR GREATNESS FOR PROGRESS AND FOR CHANGE DIES THE MOMENT WE TRY TO BE LIKE SOMEONE ELSE PLEASE DON 'T TELL ME I 'M NORMAL THANK YOU
