DidierSornette_2013G@20.51:24.27 THIS WAS CALLED THE GREAT MODERATION
DidierSornette_2013G@24.27:42.98 THE MISGUIDED BELIEF BY MOST ECONOMISTS POLICYMAKERS AND CENTRAL BANKS THAT WE HAVE TRANSFORMED INTO A NEW WORLD OF NEVER ENDING GROWTH AND PROSPERITY THIS WAS SEEN BY ROBUST AND STEADY GDP GROWTH
DidierSornette_2013G@42.98:46.05 BY LOW AND CONTROLLED INFLATION
DidierSornette_2013G@46.05:51.64 BY LOW UNEMPLOYMENT AND CONTROLLED AND LOW FINANCIAL VOLATILITY
DidierSornette_2013G@95.33:114.7 THERE WAS NO RESPONSIBILITY SO AS A REFLECTION OF THIS WE STARTED THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OBSERVATORY WE HAD THE GOAL TO DIAGNOSE IN REAL TIME FINANCIAL BUBBLES AND IDENTIFY IN ADVANCE THEIR CRITICAL TIME
DidierSornette_2013G@114.7:119.28 WHAT IS THE UNDERPINNING SCIENTIFICALLY OF THIS FINANCIAL OBSERVATORY
DidierSornette_2013G@119.28:122.94 WE DEVELOPED A THEORY CALLED DRAGON KINGS
DidierSornette_2013G@122.94:139.51 DRAGON KINGS REPRESENT EXTREME EVENTS WHICH ARE OF A CLASS OF THEIR OWN THEY ARE SPECIAL THEY ARE OUTLIERS THEY ARE GENERATED BY SPECIFIC MECHANISMS THAT MAY MAKE THEM PREDICTABLE PERHAPS
DidierSornette_2013G@139.9:146.12 CONTROLLABLE CONSIDER THE FINANCIAL PRICE TIME SERIES
DidierSornette_2013G@146.12:162.12 A GIVEN STOCK YOUR PERFECT STOCK OR A GLOBAL INDEX YOU HAVE THESE UP AND DOWNS A VERY GOOD MEASURE OF THE RISK OF THIS FINANCIAL MARKET IS THE PEAKS TO VALLEYS THAT REPRESENT A WORST CASE SCENARIO WHEN YOU BOUGHT AT THE TOP
DidierSornette_2013G@162.65:172.89 AND SOLD AT THE BOTTOM YOU CAN LOOK AT THE STATISTICS THE FREQUENCY OF THE OCCURRENCE OF PEAK TO VALLEYS OF DIFFERENT SIZES WHICH IS REPRESENTED IN THIS GRAPH
DidierSornette_2013G@172.89:186.28 NOW INTERESTINGLY NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE PEAK TO VALLEYS OF DIFFERENT AMPLITUDES CAN BE REPRESENTED BY A UNIVERSAL POWER LAW REPRESENTED BY THIS RED LINE HERE
DidierSornette_2013G@186.28:205.83 MORE INTERESTINGLY THERE ARE OUTLIERS THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS WHICH ARE ABOVE THIS RED LINE OCCUR ONE HUNDRED TIMES MORE FREQUENTLY AT LEAST THAN THE EXTRAPOLATION WOULD PREDICT THEM TO OCCUR BASED ON THE CALIBRATION OF THE NINETY NINE PERCENT REMAINING PEAK TO VALLEYS
DidierSornette_2013G@205.83:211.02 THEY ARE DUE TO TRENCHANT
DidierSornette_2013G@213.27:232.55 A LOSS IS FOLLOWED BY A LOSS WHICH IS FOLLOWED BY A LOSS WHICH IS FOLLOWED BY A LOSS THESE KINDS OF DEPENDENCIES ARE LARGELY MISSED BY STANDARD RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS WHICH IGNORE THEM AND SEE LIZARDS WHEN THEY SHOULD SEE DRAGON KINGS
DidierSornette_2013G@232.55:244.58 THE ROOT MECHANISM OF A DRAGON KING IS A SLOW MATURATION TOWARDS INSTABILITY WHICH IS THE BUBBLE AND THE CLIMAX OF THE BUBBLE IS OFTEN THE CRASH
DidierSornette_2013G@263.17:281.56 IS THE REFLECTION OF A COLLECTIVE EMERGENT BEHAVIOR WHICH IS FUNDAMENTALLY ENDOGENOUS SO THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH THE CAUSE OF THE CRISIS HAS TO BE FOUND IN AN INNER INSTABILITY OF THE SYSTEM AND ANY TINY PERTURBATION WILL MAKE THIS INSTABILITY OCCUR
DidierSornette_2013G@281.56:291.02 NOW SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE COME TO THE MIND THAT IS THIS NOT RELATED TO THE BLACK SWAN CONCEPT YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT FREQUENTLY
DidierSornette_2013G@291.02:306.97 REMEMBER BLACK SWAN IS THIS RARE BIRD THAT YOU SEE ONCE AND SUDDENLY SHATTERED YOUR BELIEF THAT ALL SWANS SHOULD BE WHITE SO IT HAS CAPTURED THE IDEA OF UNPREDICTABILITY UNKNOWABILITY THAT THE EXTREME EVENTS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY UNKNOWABLE
DidierSornette_2013G@306.97:318.65 NOTHING CAN BE FURTHER FROM THE DRAGON KING CONCEPT I PROPOSE WHICH IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE THAT MOST EXTREME EVENTS ARE ACTUALLY KNOWABLE AND PREDICTABLE
DidierSornette_2013G@318.65:329.67 SO WE CAN BE EMPOWERED AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND MAKE PREDICTIONS ABOUT THEM SO LET 'S HAVE MY DRAGON KING BURN THIS BLACK SWAN CONCEPT
DidierSornette_2013G@339.6:349.25 WHAT DOES IT MEAN IMAGINE YOU HAVE AN INVESTMENT THAT RETURNS THE FIRST YEAR FIVE PERCENT THE SECOND YEAR TEN PERCENT THE THIRD YEAR TWENTY PERCENT
DidierSornette_2013G@349.25:360.53 THE NEXT YEAR FORTY PERCENT IS THAT NOT MARVELOUS THIS IS A SUPER EXPONENTIAL GROWTH A STANDARD EXPONENTIAL GROWTH CORRESPONDS TO A CONSTANT GROWTH RATE LET 'S SAY OF TEN PERCENT
DidierSornette_2013G@360.53:369.17 THE POINT IS THAT MANY TIMES DURING BUBBLES THERE ARE POSITIVE FEEDBACKS WHICH CAN BE OF MANY TIMES SUCH THAT
DidierSornette_2013G@380.71:389.32 AND THE KEY IDEA IS THAT THE MATHEMATICAL SOLUTION OF THIS CLASS OF MODELS EXHIBIT FINITE TIME SINGULARITIES WHICH MEANS
DidierSornette_2013G@389.33:407.29 THAT THERE IS A CRITICAL TIME WHERE THE SYSTEM WILL BREAK WILL CHANGE REGIME IT MAY BE A CRASH IT MAY BE JUST A PLATEAU SOMETHING ELSE AND THE KEY IDEA IS THAT THE CRITICAL TIME THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRITICAL TIME IS CONTAINED IN THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SUPER EXPONENTIAL GROWTH
DidierSornette_2013G@407.29:417.49 WE HAVE APPLIED THIS THEORY EARLY ON THAT WAS OUR FIRST SUCCESS TO THE DIAGNOSTIC OF THE RUPTURE OF KEY ELEMENTS ON THE IRON ROCKET
DidierSornette_2013G@417.49:433.3 USING ACOUSTIC EMISSION YOU KNOW THIS LITTLE NOISE THAT YOU HEAR A STRUCTURE EMIT SING TO YOU WHEN THEY ARE STRESSED AND REVEAL THE DAMAGE GOING ON THERE 'S A COLLECTIVE PHENOMENON OF POSITIVE FEEDBACK THE MORE DAMAGE GIVES THE MORE DAMAGE SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY PREDICT
DidierSornette_2013G@444.11:453.88 PERHAPS MORE SURPRISINGLY THE SAME TYPE OF THEORY APPLIES TO BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE PARTURITION THE ACT OF GIVING BIRTH EPILEPTIC SEIZURES
DidierSornette_2013G@453.88:472.22 FROM SEVEN MONTHS OF PREGNANCY A MOTHER STARTS TO FEEL EPISODIC PRECURSORY CONTRACTIONS OF THE UTERUS THAT ARE THE SIGN OF THESE MATURATIONS TOWARD THE INSTABILITY GIVING BIRTH TO THE BABY THE DRAGON KING
DidierSornette_2013G@472.22:484.67 SO IF YOU MEASURE THE PRECURSOR SIGNAL YOU CAN ACTUALLY IDENTIFY PRE AND POST MATURITY PROBLEMS IN ADVANCE EPILEPTIC SEIZURES
DidierSornette_2013G@498.78:513.47 WE HAVE APPLIED THIS THEORY TO MANY SYSTEMS LANDSLIDES GLACIER COLLAPSE EVEN TO THE DYNAMICS OF PREDICTION OF SUCCESS BLOCKBUSTERS YOUTUBE VIDEOS MOVIES AND SO ON BUT PERHAPS
DidierSornette_2013G@525.2:534.84 IN THIRTY YEARS OF HISTORY OF BUBBLES STARTING IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY WITH THE GLOBAL BUBBLE CRASHING IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN FOLLOWED BY
DidierSornette_2013G@553.94:557.11 WE HAD A GLOBAL BUBBLE
DidierSornette_2013G@557.11:572.33 THIS IS A MEASURE OF GLOBAL OVERVALUATION OF ALL MARKETS EXPRESSING WHAT I CALL AN ILLUSION OF A PERPETUAL MONEY MACHINE THAT SUDDENLY BROKE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
DidierSornette_2013G@572.33:588.85 THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE SEE THE SAME PROCESS IN PARTICULAR THROUGH QUANTITATIVE EASING OF A THINKING OF A PERPETUAL MONEY MACHINE NOWADAYS TO TACKLE THE CRISIS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IN THE U S IN EUROPE IN JAPAN
DidierSornette_2013G@605.55:610.87 NOW THESE ARE BIG CLAIMS WHY WOULD YOU BELIEVE ME
DidierSornette_2013G@610.87:616.88 WELL PERHAPS BECAUSE IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS WE HAVE COME OUT OF OUR IVORY TOWER
DidierSornette_2013G@617.13:624.39 AND STARTED TO PUBLISH EX ANTE AND I STRESS THE TERM EX ANTE IT MEANS IN ADVANCE BEFORE THE CRASH
DidierSornette_2013G@632.88:634.49 WE HAVE LIVED THROUGH
DidierSornette_2013G@634.49:641.2 IN RECENT HISTORY AGAIN MANY INTERESTING STORIES FOR EACH OF THEM LET ME TELL YOU JUST ONE OR TWO
DidierSornette_2013G@641.2:655.23 STORIES THAT DEAL WITH MASSIVE BUBBLES WE ALL KNOW THE CHINESE MIRACLE THIS IS THE EXPRESSION OF THE STOCK MARKET OF A MASSIVE BUBBLE A FACTOR OF THREE THREE HUNDRED PERCENT IN JUST A FEW YEARS
DidierSornette_2013G@655.23:668.01 IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN I WAS INVITED AS A KEYNOTE SPEAKER OF A MACRO HEDGE FUND MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE AND I SHOWED TO THE CONFERENCE A PREDICTION
DidierSornette_2013G@668.01:677.97 THAT BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THIS BUBBLE WOULD CHANGE REGIME THERE MIGHT BE A CRASH CERTAINLY NOT SUSTAINABLE NOW
DidierSornette_2013G@678.01:694.24 HOW DO YOU BELIEVE THE VERY SMART VERY MOTIVATED VERY INFORMED MACRO HEDGE FUND MANAGERS REACTED TO THIS PREDICTION YOU KNOW THEY HAD MADE BILLIONS JUST SURFING THIS BUBBLE UNTIL NOW
DidierSornette_2013G@694.24:700.75 THEY TOLD ME DIDIER YEAH THE MARKET MIGHT BE OVERVALUED BUT YOU FORGET SOMETHING
DidierSornette_2013G@714.18:730.51 THREE WEEKS AFTER MY PRESENTATION THE MARKETS LOST TWENTY PERCENT AND WENT THROUGH A PHASE OF VOLATILITY UPHEAVAL AND A TOTAL MARKET LOSS OF SEVENTY PERCENT UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR SO HOW CAN WE BE SO COLLECTIVELY WRONG BY
DidierSornette_2013G@730.51:741.3 MISREADING OR IGNORING THE SCIENCE OF THE FACT THAT WHEN AN INSTABILITY HAS DEVELOPED AND THE SYSTEM IS RIPE ANY PERTURBATION MAKES IT ESSENTIALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL
DidierSornette_2013G@741.3:749.54 THE CHINESE MARKET COLLAPSED BUT IT REBOUNDED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE
DidierSornette_2013G@764.9:770.87 OUR CRITICS READING THE PREDICTION SAID NO
DidierSornette_2013G@812.36:821.72 SO WE INVENTED A NEW WAY OF DOING SCIENCE WE CREATED THE FINANCIAL BUBBLE EXPERIMENT THE IDEA IS THE FOLLOWING WE MONITOR THE MARKETS
DidierSornette_2013G@821.72:825.3 WE IDENTIFY EXCESSES BUBBLES
DidierSornette_2013G@825.3:828.89 WE DO OUR WORK WE WRITE A REPORT
DidierSornette_2013G@828.89:848.5 IN WHICH WE PUT OUR PREDICTION OF THE CRITICAL TIME WE DON 'T RELEASE THE REPORT IT 'S KEPT SECRET BUT WITH MODERN ENCRYPTING TECHNIQUES WE HAVE A HASH WE PUBLISH A PUBLIC KEY AND SIX MONTHS LATER WE RELEASE THE REPORT AND THERE IS AUTHENTICATION
DidierSornette_2013G@848.5:858.94 AND ALL THIS IS DONE ON AN INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVE SO THAT WE CANNOT BE ACCUSED OF JUST RELEASING THE SUCCESSES LET ME TEASE YOU
DidierSornette_2013G@859:868.41 WITH A VERY RECENT ANALYSIS SEVENTEENTH OF MAY TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN JUST TWO WEEKS AGO WE IDENTIFIED THAT THE U S STOCK MARKET WAS ON AN UNSUSTAINABLE PATH
DidierSornette_2013G@868.41:879.37 AND WE RELEASED THIS ON OUR WEBSITE ON THE TWENTY FIRST OF MAY THAT THERE WILL BE A CHANGE OF REGIME THE NEXT DAY THE MARKET STARTED TO CHANGE REGIME COURSE
DidierSornette_2013G@879.37:885.9 THIS IS NOT A CRASH THIS IS JUST THE THIRD OR FOURTH ACT OF A MASSIVE BUBBLE IN THE MAKING
DidierSornette_2013G@905.24:916.47 THIS DIAGRAM ON THE RIGHT SHOWS A VERY BEAUTIFUL COMPILATION OF STUDIES SUGGESTING INDEED THAT THERE IS A NONLINEAR POSSIBILITY FOR A NONLINEAR TRANSITION JUST
DidierSornette_2013G@916.47:923.94 IN THE NEXT FEW DECADES SO THERE ARE BUBBLES EVERYWHERE FROM ONE SIDE THIS IS EXCITING
DidierSornette_2013G@923.94:934.06 FOR ME AS A PROFESSOR WHO CHASES BUBBLES AND SLAYS DRAGONS AS THE MEDIA HAS SOMETIMES CALLED ME BUT CAN WE REALLY SLAY THE DRAGONS
DidierSornette_2013G@976.85:996.14 BUT THE DRAGON KING THEORY GIVES HOPE WE LEARN THAT MOST SYSTEMS HAVE POCKETS OF PREDICTABILITY IT IS POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP ADVANCE DIAGNOSTICS OF CRISES SO THAT WE CAN BE PREPARED WE CAN TAKE MEASURES WE CAN TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
DidierSornette_2013G@996.14:1010.21 AND SO THAT NEVER AGAIN WILL EXTREMES AND CRISES LIKE THE GREAT RECESSION OR THE EUROPEAN CRISIS TAKE US BY SURPRISE THANK YOU
