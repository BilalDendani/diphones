JayWalker_2008 REAL METEORITE AND YOU CAN SEE ALL THE MELTING OF THE IRON FROM THE SPEED AND THE HEAT WHEN A METEORITE HITS THE EARTH AND JUST HOW MUCH OF IT SURVIVES AND MELTS
JayWalker_2008 FROM A METEORITE FROM SPACE WE A RE OVER HERE WITH AN ORIGINAL SPUTNIK THIS IS ONE OF THE SEVEN SURVIVING SPUTNIKS THAT WAS NOT LAUNCHED INTO SPACE THIS IS NOT A COPY
JayWalker_2008 THE SPACE AGE BEGAN FIFTY YEARS AGO IN OCTOBER AND THAT A S EXACTLY WHAT SPUTNIK LOOKED LIKE
JayWalker_2008 AND IT WOULDN A T BE FUN TO TALK ABOUT THE SPACE AGE WITHOUT SEEING A FLAG THAT WAS CARRIED TO THE MOON AND BACK ON APOLLO ELEVEN
JayWalker_2008 THE ASTRONAUTS EACH GOT TO CARRY ABOUT TEN SILK FLAGS IN THEIR PERSONAL KITS THEY WOULD BRING THEM BACK AND MOUNT THEM SO THIS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN CARRIED TO THE MOON AND BACK
JayWalker_2008 SO THAT A S FOR FUN THE DAWN OF BOOKS IS OF COURSE IMPORTANT AND IT WOULDN A T BE INTERESTING TO TALK ABOUT THE DAWN OF BOOKS
JayWalker_2008 BUT WHAT A S INTERESTING ABOUT THE GUTTENBERG BIBLE AND THE DAWN OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS NOT THE BOOK YOU SEE THE BOOK WAS NOT DRIVEN
JayWalker_2008 THIS IS AN ORIGINAL PAGE OF A GUTTENBERG BIBLE SO YOU A RE LOOKING HERE AT ONE OF THE FIRST PRINTED BOOKS USING MOVABLE TYPE IN THE HISTORY OF MAN
JayWalker_2008 FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO WE ARE LIVING AT THE AGE HERE AT THE END OF THE BOOK WHERE ELECTRONIC PAPER WILL UNDOUBTEDLY REPLACE IT BUT WHY IS THIS SO INTERESTING HERE A S THE QUICK STORY
JayWalker_2008 IT TURNS OUT THAT IN THE FOURTEEN FIFTIES THE CATHOLIC CHURCH NEEDED MONEY AND SO THEY PRINTED INDULGE THEY ACTUALLY HAND WROTE THESE THINGS CALLED INDULGENCES WHICH WERE FORGIVENESS A S ON PIECES OF PAPER
JayWalker_2008 THAT THEY TRAVELED ALL AROUND EUROPE AND SOLD BY THE HUNDREDS OR BY THE THOUSANDS THEY GOT YOU OUT OF PURGATORY FASTER
JayWalker_2008 TO PRINT OUT THOUSANDS AND THEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AND THEN ULTIMATELY MILLIONS OF SINGLE SMALL PIECES OF PAPER THAT GOT YOU OUT OF MIDDLE HELL AND INTO HEAVEN
JayWalker_2008 THAT IS WHY THE PRINTING PRESS SUCCEEDED AND THAT IS WHY MARTIN LUTHER NAILED HIS NINETY THESES TO THE DOOR BECAUSE HE WAS COMPLAINING
JayWalker_2008 THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAD GONE AMOK IN PRINTING OUT INDULGENCES AND SELLING THEM IN EVERY TOWN AND VILLAGE AND CITY
JayWalker_2008 THIS IS WHAT I SAID I WANTED TO BUILD THIS IS THE LIBRARY OF HUMAN IMAGINATION THE ROOM ITSELF IS THREE STORIES TALL
JayWalker_2008 IN THE GLASS PANELS IS FIVE THOUSAND YEARS OF HUMAN IMAGINATION THAT ARE COMPUTER CONTROLLED THE ROOM IS A THEATRE IT CHANGES COLORS AND ALL THROUGHOUT THE LIBRARY ARE DIFFERENT OBJECTS DIFFERENT SPACES IT A S DESIGNED LIKE AN ESCHER PRINT
JayWalker_2008 HERE IS SOME OF THE LOWER LEVEL OF THE LIBRARY WHERE THE EXHIBITS CONSTANTLY CHANGE YOU CAN WALK THROUGH YOU CAN TOUCH YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY HOW MANY OF THESE TYPES OF ITEMS WOULD FIT IN A ROOM THERE A S MY VERY OWN SATURN V EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE ONE OK SO
JayWalker_2008 YOU CAN SEE HERE IN THE LOWER LEVEL OF THE LIBRARY THE BOOKS AND THE OBJECTS IN THE GLASS PANELS ALL ALONG IS SORT OF THE HISTORY OF IMAGINATION THERE IS A GLASS BRIDGE THAT YOU WALK ACROSS THAT A S SUSPENDED IN SPACE SO IT A S A LEAP OF IMAGINATION SO
JayWalker_2008 HOW DO WE CREATE AND PART OF THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE ANSWERED IS WE CREATE BY SURROUNDING OURSELVES WITH STIMULI WITH HUMAN ACHIEVEMENT WITH HISTORY
JayWalker_2008 WITH THE THINGS THAT DRIVE US AND MAKE US HUMAN THE PASSIONATE DISCOVERY THE BONES OF DINOSAURS LONG GONE THE MAPS OF SPACE THAT WE A VE EXPERIENCED AND ULTIMATELY THE HALLWAYS THAT STIMULATE OUR MIND AND OUR IMAGINATION
JayWalker_2008 BUT THINKING ABOUT THEM IN WAYS THAT NOBODY HAS THOUGHT OF THEM BEFORE AND THAT A S REALLY WHAT DISCOVERY AND IMAGINATION IS ALL ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN LOOK
JayWalker_2008 AT A DNA MOLECULE MODEL HERE
JayWalker_2008 NONE OF US REALLY HAVE EVER SEEN ONE BUT WE KNOW IT EXISTS BECAUSE WE A VE BEEN TAUGHT TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS MOLECULE BUT WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT AN ENIGMA MACHINE FROM THE NAZIS IN WORLD WAR
JayWalker_2008 THAT WAS A CODING AND DECODING MACHINE NOW YOU MIGHT SAY WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THIS WELL THIS IS THE CODE FOR LIFE AND THIS IS A CODE FOR DEATH
JayWalker_2008 AND A MOLECULE BUT ONCE YOU A VE SEEN THEM IN A NEW WAY YOU REALIZE THAT BOTH OF THESE THINGS REALLY ARE CONNECTED AND THEY A RE CONNECTED PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THIS HERE
JayWalker_2008 YOU SEE THIS IS A HUMAN BRAIN MODEL
JayWalker_2008 AND ONCE WE CREATE NEW PATTERNS IN THIS BRAIN ONCE WE SHAPE THE BRAIN IN A NEW WAY IT NEVER RETURNS TO ITS ORIGINAL SHAPE
JayWalker_2008 I BROUGHT ALONG HERE
JayWalker_2008 RIGHT HERE ONE LUMP OF COAL AND WHAT DOES A LUMP OF COAL HAVE TO DO WITH THE INTERNET YOU SEE IT TAKES THE ENERGY IN ONE LUMP OF COAL TO MOVE ONE MEGABYTE OF INFORMATION ACROSS THE NET
JayWalker_2008 SO EVERY TIME YOU DOWNLOAD A FILE EACH MEGABYTE IS A LUMP OF COAL WHAT THAT MEANS IS A TWO HUNDRED MEGABYTE FILE
JayWalker_2008 LOOKS LIKE THIS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OK
