MarkPagel_2011G DANGEROUS AND SUBVERSIVE TRAIT THAT NATURAL SELECTION HAS EVER DEVISED
MarkPagel_2011G IT 'S A PIECE OF NEURAL AUDIO TECHNOLOGY FOR REWIRING OTHER PEOPLE 'S MINDS I 'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR LANGUAGE OF COURSE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOU TO IMPLANT A THOUGHT FROM YOUR MIND DIRECTLY INTO SOMEONE ELSE 'S MIND AND THEY CAN ATTEMPT TO DO THE SAME TO YOU WITHOUT EITHER OF YOU HAVING TO PERFORM SURGERY
MarkPagel_2011G INSTEAD WHEN YOU SPEAK YOU 'RE ACTUALLY USING A FORM OF TELEMETRY NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM THE REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE FOR YOUR TELEVISION IT 'S JUST THAT WHEREAS THAT DEVICE RELIES ON PULSES OF INFRARED LIGHT
MarkPagel_2011G YOUR LANGUAGE RELIES ON PULSES DISCRETE PULSES OF SOUND AND JUST AS YOU USE THE REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE TO ALTER THE INTERNAL SETTINGS OF YOUR TELEVISION TO SUIT YOUR MOOD
MarkPagel_2011G YOU USE YOUR LANGUAGE TO ALTER THE SETTINGS INSIDE SOMEONE ELSE 'S BRAIN TO SUIT YOUR INTERESTS LANGUAGES ARE GENES TALKING GETTING THINGS THAT THEY WANT
MarkPagel_2011G AND JUST IMAGINE THE SENSE OF WONDER IN A BABY WHEN IT FIRST DISCOVERS THAT MERELY BY UTTERING A SOUND IT CAN GET OBJECTS TO MOVE ACROSS A ROOM AS IF BY MAGIC AND MAYBE EVEN INTO ITS MOUTH
MarkPagel_2011G NOW LANGUAGE 'S SUBVERSIVE POWER HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE AGES IN CENSORSHIP IN BOOKS YOU CAN 'T READ PHRASES YOU CAN 'T USE AND WORDS YOU CAN 'T SAY IN FACT
MarkPagel_2011G NOW GOD ANGERED AT THIS ATTEMPT TO USURP HIS POWER DESTROYED THE TOWER
MarkPagel_2011G AND THEN TO ENSURE THAT IT WOULD NEVER BE REBUILT HE SCATTERED THE PEOPLE BY GIVING THEM DIFFERENT LANGUAGES CONFUSED THEM BY GIVING THEM DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND THIS LEADS TO THE WONDERFUL IRONY THAT OUR LANGUAGES EXIST TO PREVENT US FROM
MarkPagel_2011G COMMUNICATING EVEN TODAY WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE WORDS WE CANNOT USE PHRASES WE CANNOT SAY BECAUSE IF WE DO SO WE MIGHT BE ACCOSTED JAILED OR EVEN KILLED
MarkPagel_2011G AND ALL OF THIS FROM A PUFF OF AIR EMANATING FROM OUR MOUTHS NOW ALL THIS FUSS ABOUT A SINGLE ONE OF OUR TRAITS TELLS US THERE 'S SOMETHING WORTH EXPLAINING AND THAT IS HOW AND WHY DID THIS REMARKABLE TRAIT EVOLVE AND WHY DID IT EVOLVE ONLY IN OUR SPECIES
MarkPagel_2011G NOW IT 'S A LITTLE BIT OF A SURPRISE THAT TO GET AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION WE HAVE TO GO TO TOOL USE IN THE CHIMPANZEES
MarkPagel_2011G NOW THESE CHIMPANZEES ARE USING TOOLS AND WE TAKE THAT AS A SIGN OF THEIR INTELLIGENCE BUT IF THEY REALLY WERE INTELLIGENT WHY WOULD THEY USE A STICK TO EXTRACT TERMITES FROM THE GROUND RATHER THAN A SHOVEL
MarkPagel_2011G AND IF THEY REALLY WERE INTELLIGENT WHY WOULD THEY CRACK OPEN NUTS WITH A ROCK WHY WOULDN 'T THEY JUST GO TO A SHOP AND BUY A BAG OF NUTS THAT SOMEBODY ELSE HAD ALREADY CRACKED OPEN FOR THEM
MarkPagel_2011G WHY NOT I MEAN THAT 'S WHAT WE DO
MarkPagel_2011G NOW THE REASON THE CHIMPANZEES DON 'T DO THAT IS THAT THEY LACK WHAT PSYCHOLOGISTS AND ANTHROPOLOGISTS CALL SOCIAL LEARNING THEY SEEM TO LACK THE ABILITY TO LEARN FROM OTHERS BY COPYING OR IMITATING OR SIMPLY WATCHING
MarkPagel_2011G AS A RESULT THEY CAN 'T IMPROVE ON OTHERS IDEAS OR LEARN FROM OTHERS MISTAKES BENEFIT FROM OTHERS WISDOM AND SO THEY JUST DO THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
MarkPagel_2011G IN FACT WE COULD GO AWAY FOR A MILLION YEARS AND COME BACK AND THESE CHIMPANZEES WOULD BE DOING THE SAME THING WITH THE SAME STICKS FOR THE TERMITES AND THE SAME ROCKS TO CRACK OPEN THE NUTS
MarkPagel_2011G BUT IF WE LOOK AT THE FOSSIL RECORD WE SEE THAT THEY MADE THE SAME HAND AXE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR ONE MILLION YEARS YOU CAN FOLLOW IT THROUGH THE FOSSIL RECORD
MarkPagel_2011G NOW IF WE MAKE SOME GUESSES ABOUT HOW LONG HOMO ERECTUS LIVED WHAT THEIR GENERATION TIME WAS THAT 'S ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND GENERATIONS OF PARENTS TO OFFSPRING AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS WATCHING IN WHICH THAT HAND AXE DIDN 'T CHANGE
MarkPagel_2011G IT 'S NOT EVEN CLEAR THAT OUR VERY CLOSE GENETIC RELATIVES THE NEANDERTHALS HAD SOCIAL LEARNING SURE ENOUGH THEIR TOOLS WERE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THOSE OF HOMO ERECTUS
MarkPagel_2011G BUT THEY TOO SHOWED VERY LITTLE CHANGE OVER THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS OR SO THAT THOSE SPECIES THE NEANDERTHALS LIVED IN EURASIA
MarkPagel_2011G OKAY SO WHAT THIS TELLS US IS THAT CONTRARY TO THE OLD ADAGE MONKEY SEE MONKEY DO
MarkPagel_2011G THE SURPRISE REALLY IS THAT ALL OF THE OTHER ANIMALS REALLY CANNOT DO THAT AT LEAST NOT VERY MUCH AND EVEN THIS PICTURE HAS THE SUSPICIOUS TAINT OF BEING RIGGED ABOUT IT SOMETHING FROM A BARNUM BAILEY CIRCUS
MarkPagel_2011G BUT BY COMPARISON WE CAN LEARN WE CAN LEARN BY WATCHING OTHER PEOPLE AND COPYING OR IMITATING WHAT THEY CAN DO WE CAN THEN CHOOSE FROM AMONG A RANGE OF OPTIONS THE BEST ONE
MarkPagel_2011G WE CAN BENEFIT FROM OTHERS IDEAS WE CAN BUILD ON THEIR WISDOM AND AS A RESULT OUR IDEAS DO ACCUMULATE AND OUR TECHNOLOGY PROGRESSES
MarkPagel_2011G AND THIS CUMULATIVE CULTURAL ADAPTATION AS ANTHROPOLOGISTS CALL THIS ACCUMULATION OF IDEAS
MarkPagel_2011G IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING AROUND YOU IN YOUR BUSTLING AND TEEMING EVERYDAY LIVES I MEAN THE WORLD HAS CHANGED
MarkPagel_2011G OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO WHAT WE WOULD RECOGNIZE EVEN ONE THOUSAND OR TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO AND ALL OF THIS BECAUSE OF CUMULATIVE CULTURAL ADAPTATION THE CHAIRS YOU 'RE SITTING IN THE LIGHTS IN THIS AUDITORIUM MY MICROPHONE THE IPADS AND IPODS THAT YOU CARRY AROUND WITH YOU ALL ARE A RESULT OF CUMULATIVE CULTURAL ADAPTATION
MarkPagel_2011G NOW TO MANY COMMENTATORS CUMULATIVE CULTURAL ADAPTATION OR SOCIAL LEARNING IS JOB DONE END OF STORY
MarkPagel_2011G OUR SPECIES CAN MAKE STUFF THEREFORE WE PROSPERED IN A WAY THAT NO OTHER SPECIES HAS IN FACT WE CAN EVEN MAKE THE STUFF OF LIFE AS I JUST SAID ALL THE STUFF AROUND US BUT IN FACT IT TURNS OUT THAT SOME TIME AROUND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO WHEN OUR SPECIES FIRST AROSE AND ACQUIRED SOCIAL LEARNING
MarkPagel_2011G THAT THIS WAS REALLY THE BEGINNING OF OUR STORY NOT THE END OF OUR STORY BECAUSE OUR ACQUISITION OF SOCIAL LEARNING WOULD CREATE A SOCIAL AND EVOLUTIONARY DILEMMA THE RESOLUTION OF WHICH IT 'S FAIR TO SAY WOULD DETERMINE NOT ONLY THE FUTURE COURSE OF OUR PSYCHOLOGY BUT THE FUTURE COURSE OF THE ENTIRE WORLD
MarkPagel_2011G AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR THIS IT 'LL TELL US WHY WE HAVE LANGUAGE
MarkPagel_2011G AND THE REASON THAT DILEMMA AROSE IS IT TURNS OUT THAT SOCIAL LEARNING IS VISUAL THEFT
MarkPagel_2011G IF I CAN LEARN BY WATCHING YOU I CAN STEAL YOUR BEST IDEAS AND I CAN BENEFIT FROM YOUR EFFORTS WITHOUT HAVING TO PUT IN THE TIME AND ENERGY THAT YOU DID INTO DEVELOPING THEM
MarkPagel_2011G IF I CAN WATCH WHICH LURE YOU USE TO CATCH A FISH OR I CAN WATCH HOW YOU FLAKE YOUR HAND AXE TO MAKE IT BETTER OR IF I FOLLOW YOU SECRETLY TO YOUR MUSHROOM PATCH
MarkPagel_2011G I CAN BENEFIT FROM YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM AND SKILLS AND MAYBE EVEN CATCH THAT FISH BEFORE YOU DO SOCIAL LEARNING REALLY IS VISUAL THEFT
MarkPagel_2011G AND IN ANY SPECIES THAT ACQUIRED IT IT WOULD BEHOOVE YOU TO HIDE YOUR BEST IDEAS LEST SOMEBODY STEAL THEM FROM YOU
MarkPagel_2011G AND SO SOME TIME AROUND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO OUR SPECIES CONFRONTED THIS CRISIS
MarkPagel_2011G AND WE REALLY HAD ONLY TWO OPTIONS FOR DEALING WITH THE CONFLICTS THAT VISUAL THEFT WOULD BRING
MarkPagel_2011G ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS WAS THAT WE COULD HAVE RETREATED INTO SMALL FAMILY GROUPS BECAUSE THEN THE BENEFITS OF OUR IDEAS AND KNOWLEDGE WOULD FLOW JUST TO OUR RELATIVES
MarkPagel_2011G HAD WE CHOSEN THIS OPTION SOMETIME AROUND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO WE WOULD PROBABLY STILL BE LIVING LIKE THE NEANDERTHALS WERE WHEN WE FIRST ENTERED EUROPE FORTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO
MarkPagel_2011G AND THIS IS BECAUSE IN SMALL GROUPS THERE ARE FEWER IDEAS THERE ARE FEWER INNOVATIONS AND SMALL GROUPS ARE MORE PRONE TO ACCIDENTS AND BAD LUCK SO IF WE 'D CHOSEN THAT PATH OUR EVOLUTIONARY PATH WOULD HAVE LED INTO THE FOREST AND BEEN A SHORT ONE INDEED
MarkPagel_2011G THE OTHER OPTION WE COULD CHOOSE WAS TO DEVELOP THE SYSTEMS OF COMMUNICATION THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO SHARE IDEAS AND TO COOPERATE AMONGST OTHERS
MarkPagel_2011G CHOOSING THIS OPTION WOULD MEAN THAT A VASTLY GREATER FUND OF ACCUMULATED KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM WOULD BECOME AVAILABLE TO ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL THAN WOULD EVER ARISE FROM WITHIN AN INDIVIDUAL FAMILY OR AN INDIVIDUAL PERSON ON THEIR OWN
MarkPagel_2011G WELL WE CHOSE THE SECOND OPTION
MarkPagel_2011G AND LANGUAGE IS THE RESULT LANGUAGE EVOLVED TO SOLVE THE CRISIS OF VISUAL THEFT LANGUAGE IS A PIECE OF SOCIAL TECHNOLOGY FOR ENHANCING THE BENEFITS OF COOPERATION FOR REACHING AGREEMENTS FOR STRIKING DEALS AND FOR COORDINATING OUR ACTIVITIES
MarkPagel_2011G AND WE TAKE THIS UTTERLY FOR GRANTED BECAUSE WE 'RE A SPECIES THAT IS SO AT HOME WITH LANGUAGE BUT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT EVEN THE SIMPLEST ACTS OF EXCHANGE THAT WE ENGAGE IN
MarkPagel_2011G ARE UTTERLY DEPENDENT UPON LANGUAGE AND TO SEE WHY CONSIDER TWO SCENARIOS FROM EARLY IN OUR EVOLUTION LET 'S IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE REALLY GOOD AT MAKING ARROWHEADS BUT YOU 'RE HOPELESS AT MAKING THE WOODEN SHAFTS WITH THE FLIGHT FEATHERS ATTACHED
MarkPagel_2011G TWO OTHER PEOPLE YOU KNOW ARE VERY GOOD AT MAKING THE WOODEN SHAFTS BUT THEY 'RE HOPELESS AT MAKING THE ARROWHEADS
MarkPagel_2011G SO WHAT YOU DO IS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE HAS NOT REALLY ACQUIRED LANGUAGE YET AND LET 'S PRETEND THE OTHER ONE IS GOOD AT LANGUAGE SKILLS SO WHAT YOU DO ONE DAY IS YOU TAKE A PILE OF ARROWHEADS AND YOU WALK UP TO THE ONE THAT CAN 'T SPEAK VERY WELL AND YOU PUT THE ARROWHEADS DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM HOPING THAT HE 'LL GET THE IDEA THAT YOU WANT TO TRADE YOUR ARROWHEADS FOR FINISHED ARROWS
MarkPagel_2011G BUT HE LOOKS AT THE PILE OF ARROWHEADS THINKS THEY 'RE A GIFT PICKS THEM UP SMILES AND WALKS OFF NOW YOU PURSUE THIS GUY GESTICULATING A SCUFFLE ENSUES AND YOU GET STABBED WITH ONE OF YOUR OWN ARROWHEADS
MarkPagel_2011G ONCE WE HAVE LANGUAGE WE CAN PUT OUR IDEAS TOGETHER AND COOPERATE TO HAVE A PROSPERITY THAT WE COULDN 'T HAVE BEFORE WE ACQUIRED IT
MarkPagel_2011G AND THIS IS WHY OUR SPECIES HAS PROSPERED AROUND THE WORLD WHILE THE REST OF THE ANIMALS SIT BEHIND BARS IN ZOOS LANGUISHING THAT 'S WHY WE BUILD SPACE SHUTTLES AND CATHEDRALS WHILE THE REST OF THE WORLD STICKS STICKS INTO THE GROUND TO EXTRACT TERMITES
MarkPagel_2011G IS TRUE ANY SPECIES THAT ACQUIRES IT SHOULD SHOW AN EXPLOSION OF CREATIVITY AND PROSPERITY AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE ARCHEOLOGICAL RECORD SHOWS
MarkPagel_2011G IF YOU LOOK AT OUR ANCESTORS THE NEANDERTHALS AND THE HOMO ERECTUS OUR IMMEDIATE ANCESTORS THEY 'RE CONFINED TO SMALL REGIONS OF THE WORLD BUT WHEN OUR SPECIES AROSE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO SOMETIME AFTER THAT WE
MarkPagel_2011G LANGUAGE REALLY IS THE MOST POTENT TRAIT THAT HAS EVER EVOLVED
MarkPagel_2011G IT IS THE MOST VALUABLE TRAIT WE HAVE FOR CONVERTING NEW LANDS AND RESOURCES INTO MORE PEOPLE AND THEIR GENES THAT NATURAL SELECTION HAS EVER DEVISED LANGUAGE REALLY IS THE VOICE OF OUR GENES
MarkPagel_2011G NOW HAVING EVOLVED LANGUAGE THOUGH WE DID SOMETHING PECULIAR EVEN BIZARRE AS WE SPREAD OUT AROUND THE WORLD
MarkPagel_2011G CURRENTLY THERE ARE ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT THOUSAND DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SPOKEN ON EARTH NOW YOU MIGHT SAY WELL THIS IS JUST NATURAL AS WE DIVERGE OUR LANGUAGES ARE NATURALLY GOING TO DIVERGE BUT THE REAL PUZZLE AND IRONY IS THAT THE GREATEST DENSITY OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ON EARTH IS FOUND WHERE PEOPLE ARE MOST
MarkPagel_2011G NOW INCREDIBLE AS THIS SOUNDS I ONCE MET A PAPUAN MAN AND I ASKED HIM IF THIS COULD POSSIBLY BE TRUE AND HE SAID TO ME OH NO THEY 'RE FAR CLOSER TOGETHER THAN THAT
MarkPagel_2011G AND IT 'S TRUE THERE ARE PLACES ON THAT ISLAND WHERE YOU CAN ENCOUNTER A NEW LANGUAGE IN UNDER A MILE AND THIS IS ALSO TRUE OF SOME REMOTE OCEANIC ISLANDS
MarkPagel_2011G AND SO IT SEEMS THAT WE USE OUR LANGUAGE NOT JUST TO COOPERATE BUT TO DRAW RINGS AROUND OUR COOPERATIVE GROUPS AND TO ESTABLISH IDENTITIES AND PERHAPS TO PROTECT OUR KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM AND SKILLS FROM EAVESDROPPING FROM OUTSIDE
MarkPagel_2011G AND WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE WHEN WE STUDY DIFFERENT LANGUAGE GROUPS AND ASSOCIATE THEM WITH THEIR CULTURES WE SEE THAT DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SLOW THE FLOW OF IDEAS BETWEEN GROUPS
MarkPagel_2011G THEY SLOW THE FLOW OF TECHNOLOGIES AND THEY EVEN SLOW THE FLOW OF GENES NOW I CAN 'T SPEAK FOR YOU BUT IT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE THAT WE DON 'T HAVE SEX WITH PEOPLE WE CAN 'T TALK TO
MarkPagel_2011G WE HAVE TO COUNTER THAT THOUGH AGAINST THE EVIDENCE WE 'VE HEARD THAT WE MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME RATHER DISTASTEFUL GENETIC DALLIANCES WITH THE NEANDERTHALS AND THE DENISOVANS
MarkPagel_2011G IN FACT IT 'S A MAP OF FACEBOOK FRIENDSHIP LINKS AND WHEN YOU PLOT THOSE FRIENDSHIP LINKS BY THEIR LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE IT LITERALLY DRAWS A MAP OF THE WORLD
MarkPagel_2011G OUR MODERN WORLD IS COMMUNICATING WITH ITSELF AND WITH EACH OTHER MORE THAN IT HAS AT ANY TIME IN ITS PAST AND THAT COMMUNICATION THAT CONNECTIVITY AROUND THE WORLD THAT GLOBALIZATION NOW RAISES A BURDEN BECAUSE
MarkPagel_2011G THESE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IMPOSE A BARRIER AS WE 'VE JUST SEEN TO THE TRANSFER OF GOODS AND IDEAS AND TECHNOLOGIES AND WISDOM AND THEY IMPOSE A BARRIER TO COOPERATION
MarkPagel_2011G AND NOWHERE DO WE SEE THAT MORE CLEARLY THAN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHOSE TWENTY SEVEN MEMBER COUNTRIES SPEAK TWENTY THREE OFFICIAL LANGUAGES
MarkPagel_2011G THE EUROPEAN UNION IS NOW SPENDING OVER ONE BILLION EUROS ANNUALLY TRANSLATING AMONG THEIR TWENTY THREE OFFICIAL LANGUAGES THAT 'S SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF ONE POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION U S DOLLARS ON TRANSLATION COSTS ALONE
MarkPagel_2011G NOW THINK OF THE ABSURDITY OF THIS SITUATION IF TWENTY SEVEN INDIVIDUALS FROM THOSE TWENTY SEVEN MEMBER STATES SAT AROUND TABLE SPEAKING THEIR TWENTY THREE LANGUAGES SOME VERY SIMPLE MATHEMATICS WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU NEED AN ARMY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE TRANSLATORS TO ANTICIPATE ALL THE PAIRWISE POSSIBILITIES
MarkPagel_2011G THE EUROPEAN UNION EMPLOYS A PERMANENT STAFF OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TRANSLATORS AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN ALONE AND I 'M SURE THERE ARE MORE RECENT FIGURES SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF ONE POINT
MarkPagel_2011G THREE MILLION PAGES WERE TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH ALONE
MarkPagel_2011G AND SO IF LANGUAGE REALLY IS THE SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS OF VISUAL THEFT IF LANGUAGE REALLY IS THE CONDUIT OF OUR COOPERATION THE TECHNOLOGY THAT OUR SPECIES DERIVED TO PROMOTE THE FREE FLOW AND EXCHANGE OF IDEAS IN OUR MODERN WORLD WE
MarkPagel_2011G CONFRONT A QUESTION AND THAT QUESTION IS WHETHER IN THIS MODERN GLOBALIZED WORLD WE CAN REALLY AFFORD TO HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES
MarkPagel_2011G AND WE SEE THIS IN THE INEXORABLE MARCH TOWARDS STANDARDIZATION THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF WAYS OF MEASURING THINGS WEIGHING THEM AND MEASURING THEIR LENGTH
MarkPagel_2011G BUT THE METRIC SYSTEM IS WINNING THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF WAYS OF MEASURING TIME BUT A REALLY BIZARRE BASE SIXTY SYSTEM KNOWN AS HOURS AND MINUTES AND SECONDS IS NEARLY UNIVERSAL AROUND THE WORLD
MarkPagel_2011G THERE ARE MANY MANY WAYS OF IMPRINTING CDS OR DVDS BUT THOSE ARE ALL BEING STANDARDIZED AS WELL AND YOU CAN PROBABLY THINK OF MANY MANY MORE IN YOUR OWN EVERYDAY LIVES AND SO
MarkPagel_2011G OUR MODERN WORLD NOW IS CONFRONTING US WITH A DILEMMA AND IT 'S THE DILEMMA THAT THIS CHINESE MAN FACES WHO 'S LANGUAGE IS SPOKEN BY MORE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THAN ANY OTHER SINGLE LANGUAGE AND YET HE IS SITTING
MarkPagel_2011G HIS BLACKBOARD CONVERTING CHINESE PHRASES INTO ENGLISH LANGUAGE PHRASES
MarkPagel_2011G AND WHAT THIS DOES IS IT RAISES THE POSSIBILITY TO US THAT IN A WORLD IN WHICH WE WANT TO PROMOTE COOPERATION AND EXCHANGE AND IN A WORLD THAT MIGHT BE DEPENDENT MORE THAN EVER BEFORE ON COOPERATION TO MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE OUR LEVELS OF PROSPERITY
MarkPagel_2011G HIS ACTIONS SUGGEST TO US IT MIGHT BE INEVITABLE THAT WE HAVE TO CONFRONT THE IDEA THAT OUR DESTINY IS TO BE ONE WORLD WITH ONE LANGUAGE THANK YOU
MarkPagel_2011G ONE QUESTION SVANTE FOUND THAT THE
MarkPagel_2011G THE SIMPLE ANSWER THEN IS THAT GENES ALONE DON 'T ALL BY THEMSELVES DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF VERY COMPLICATED THINGS LIKE LANGUAGE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS FOXP TWO AND NEANDERTHALS IS THAT THEY MAY HAVE HAD FINE MOTOR CONTROL OF THEIR MOUTHS WHO KNOWS BUT THAT DOESN 'T TELL US THEY NECESSARILY HAD LANGUAGE
