KristaTippett_2010Z@34.55:51.04 IT 'S SEEN AS A SQUISHY KUMBAYA THING OR IT 'S SEEN AS POTENTIALLY DEPRESSING KAREN ARMSTRONG HAS TOLD WHAT I THINK IS AN ICONIC STORY OF GIVING A SPEECH IN HOLLAND AND AFTER THE FACT THE WORD COMPASSION WAS TRANSLATED AS PITY
KristaTippett_2010Z@51.04:63.33 NOW COMPASSION WHEN IT ENTERS THE NEWS TOO OFTEN COMES IN THE FORM OF FEEL GOOD FEATURE PIECES OR SIDEBARS ABOUT HEROIC PEOPLE YOU COULD NEVER BE LIKE
KristaTippett_2010Z@63.33:76.23 OR HAPPY ENDINGS OR EXAMPLES OF SELF SACRIFICE THAT WOULD SEEM TO BE TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE MOST OF THE TIME OUR CULTURAL IMAGINATION ABOUT COMPASSION HAS BEEN
KristaTippett_2010Z@76.23:84.41 DEADENED BY IDEALISTIC IMAGES AND SO WHAT I 'D LIKE TO DO THIS MORNING FOR THE NEXT FEW MINUTES IS PERFORM A LINGUISTIC RESURRECTION
KristaTippett_2010Z@84.47:94.18 AND I HOPE YOU 'LL COME WITH ME ON MY BASIC PREMISE THAT WORDS MATTER THAT THEY SHAPE THE WAY WE UNDERSTAND OURSELVES THE WAY WE INTERPRET THE WORLD AND THE WAY WE TREAT OTHERS
KristaTippett_2010Z@94.18:105.95 WHEN THIS COUNTRY FIRST ENCOUNTERED GENUINE DIVERSITY IN THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY S WE ADOPTED TOLERANCE AS THE CORE CIVIC VIRTUE WITH WHICH WE WOULD APPROACH THAT
KristaTippett_2010Z@105.95:113.99 NOW THE WORD TOLERANCE IF YOU LOOK AT IT IN THE DICTIONARY CONNOTES ALLOWING INDULGING AND ENDURING
KristaTippett_2010Z@114.72:122.41 IN THE MEDICAL CONTEXT THAT IT COMES FROM IT IS ABOUT TESTING THE LIMITS OF THRIVING IN AN UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT
KristaTippett_2010Z@122.41:136.95 TOLERANCE IS NOT REALLY A LIVED VIRTUE IT 'S MORE OF A CEREBRAL ASCENT AND IT 'S TOO CEREBRAL TO ANIMATE GUTS AND HEARTS AND BEHAVIOR WHEN THE GOING GETS ROUGH AND THE GOING IS PRETTY ROUGH RIGHT
KristaTippett_2010Z@153.37:157.28 OUR RELIGIOUS SPIRITUAL AND ETHICAL TRADITIONS AND YET IT TRANSCENDS THEM
KristaTippett_2010Z@173.72:183.61 WHAT ARE ITS KINDRED AND COMPONENT PARTS WHAT 'S IN ITS UNIVERSE OF ATTENDANT VIRTUES TO START SIMPLY I WANT TO SAY THAT COMPASSION
KristaTippett_2010Z@192.37:200.78 BUT KINDNESS IS AN EVERYDAY BYPRODUCT OF ALL THE GREAT VIRTUES AND IT IS A MOST EDIFYING FORM OF INSTANT GRATIFICATION
KristaTippett_2010Z@229.45:243 COMPASSION COMPASSION CAN BE SYNONYMOUS WITH EMPATHY IT CAN BE JOINED WITH THE HARDER WORK OF FORGIVENESS AND RECONCILIATION BUT IT CAN ALSO EXPRESS ITSELF IN THE SIMPLE ACT
KristaTippett_2010Z@243.02:254.11 PRESENCE IT 'S LINKED TO PRACTICAL VIRTUES LIKE GENEROSITY AND HOSPITALITY AND JUST BEING THERE JUST SHOWING UP
KristaTippett_2010Z@255.41:267.34 I THINK THAT COMPASSION ALSO IS OFTEN LINKED TO BEAUTY AND BY THAT I MEAN A WILLINGNESS TO SEE BEAUTY IN THE OTHER NOT JUST WHAT IT IS ABOUT THEM THAT MIGHT NEED HELPING
KristaTippett_2010Z@267.55:276.16 I LOVE IT THAT MY MUSLIM CONVERSATION PARTNERS OFTEN SPEAK OF BEAUTY AS A CORE MORAL VALUE AND IN THAT LIGHT
KristaTippett_2010Z@276.21:282.3 FOR THE RELIGIOUS COMPASSION ALSO BRINGS US INTO THE TERRITORY OF MYSTERY
KristaTippett_2010Z@282.36:290.41 ENCOURAGING US NOT JUST TO SEE BEAUTY BUT PERHAPS ALSO TO LOOK FOR THE FACE OF GOD IN THE MOMENT OF SUFFERING
KristaTippett_2010Z@295.95:300.06 I 'M NOT SURE IF I CAN SHOW YOU WHAT TOLERANCE LOOKS LIKE
KristaTippett_2010Z@300.09:303.62 BUT I CAN SHOW YOU WHAT COMPASSION LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE IT IS VISIBLE
KristaTippett_2010Z@303.66:310.4 WHEN WE SEE IT WE RECOGNIZE IT AND IT CHANGES THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT WHAT IS DOABLE WHAT IS POSSIBLE
KristaTippett_2010Z@310.97:326.13 IT IS SO IMPORTANT WHEN WE 'RE COMMUNICATING BIG IDEAS BUT ESPECIALLY A BIG SPIRITUAL IDEA LIKE COMPASSION TO ROOT IT AS WE PRESENT IT TO OTHERS IN SPACE AND TIME AND FLESH AND BLOOD THE COLOR AND COMPLEXITY OF LIFE
KristaTippett_2010Z@326.73:331.11 AND COMPASSION DOES SEEK PHYSICALITY
KristaTippett_2010Z@331.11:347.17 I FIRST STARTED TO LEARN THIS MOST VIVIDLY FROM MATTHEW SANFORD AND I DON 'T IMAGINE THAT YOU WILL REALIZE THIS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH OF HIM BUT HE 'S PARAPLEGIC HE 'S BEEN PARALYZED FROM THE WAIST DOWN SINCE HE WAS THIRTEEN IN A CAR CRASH THAT KILLED HIS FATHER AND HIS SISTER
KristaTippett_2010Z@348.01:367.24 MATTHEW 'S LEGS DON 'T WORK AND HE 'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN AND AND HE DOES EXPERIENCE THIS AS AN AND RATHER THAN A BUT AND HE EXPERIENCES HIMSELF TO BE HEALED AND WHOLE AND AS A TEACHER OF YOGA HE BRINGS THAT EXPERIENCE TO OTHERS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF ABILITY AND DISABILITY HEALTH ILLNESS AND AGING
KristaTippett_2010Z@367.44:375.24 HE SAYS THAT HE 'S JUST AT AN EXTREME END OF THE SPECTRUM WE 'RE ALL ON HE 'S DOING SOME AMAZING WORK NOW
KristaTippett_2010Z@378.9:388.43 AND MATTHEW HAS MADE THIS REMARKABLE OBSERVATION THAT I 'M JUST GOING TO OFFER YOU AND LET IT SIT I CAN 'T QUITE EXPLAIN IT AND HE CAN 'T EITHER BUT HE SAYS THAT
KristaTippett_2010Z@394.06:403.08 IN ALL ITS FRAILTY AND ITS GRACE WITHOUT AT THE SAME TIME BECOMING MORE COMPASSIONATE TOWARDS ALL OF LIFE COMPASSION
KristaTippett_2010Z@403.28:405.06 ALSO LOOKS LIKE THIS
KristaTippett_2010Z@459.17:466.99 HE 'S SAYS THAT WHAT THEY DO WITH L 'ARCHE IS NOT A SOLUTION BUT A SIGN COMPASSION IS RARELY A SOLUTION
KristaTippett_2010Z@467.15:474.15 BUT IT IS ALWAYS A SIGN OF A DEEPER REALITY OF DEEPER HUMAN POSSIBILITIES AND COMPASSION
KristaTippett_2010Z@474.15:487.51 IS UNLEASHED IN WIDER AND WIDER CIRCLES BY SIGNS AND STORIES NEVER BY STATISTICS AND STRATEGIES WE NEED THOSE THINGS TOO BUT WE 'RE ALSO BUMPING UP AGAINST THEIR LIMITS
KristaTippett_2010Z@488.64:508.53 AND AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE ARE DOING THAT I THINK WE ARE REDISCOVERING THE POWER OF STORY THAT AS HUMAN BEINGS WE NEED STORIES TO SURVIVE TO FLOURISH TO CHANGE OUR TRADITIONS HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THIS AND THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE ALWAYS CULTIVATED STORIES AT THEIR HEART AND CARRIED THEM FORWARD IN TIME FOR US
KristaTippett_2010Z@508.71:512.59 THERE IS OF COURSE A STORY BEHIND THE
KristaTippett_2010Z@512.59:518.35 KEY MORAL LONGING AND COMMANDMENT OF JUDAISM TO REPAIR THE WORLD TIKKUN OLAM
KristaTippett_2010Z@518.35:528.09 AND I 'LL NEVER FORGET HEARING THAT STORY FROM DR RACHEL NAOMI REMEN WHO TOLD IT TO ME AS HER GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO HER THAT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE CREATION
KristaTippett_2010Z@528.09:547.94 SOMETHING HAPPENED AND THE ORIGINAL LIGHT OF THE UNIVERSE WAS SHATTERED INTO COUNTLESS PIECES IT LODGED AS SHARDS INSIDE EVERY ASPECT OF THE CREATION AND THAT THE HIGHEST HUMAN CALLING IS TO LOOK FOR THIS LIGHT TO POINT AT IT WHEN WE SEE IT TO GATHER IT UP AND IN SO DOING TO REPAIR THE WORLD
KristaTippett_2010Z@547.94:554.49 NOW THIS MIGHT SOUND LIKE A FANCIFUL TALE SOME OF MY FELLOW JOURNALISTS MIGHT INTERPRET IT THAT WAY
KristaTippett_2010Z@554.49:560.42 RACHEL NAOMI REMEN SAYS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AND EMPOWERING STORY FOR OUR TIME
KristaTippett_2010Z@560.42:576.4 BECAUSE THIS STORY INSISTS THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US FRAIL AND FLAWED AS WE MAY BE INADEQUATE AS WE MAY FEEL HAS EXACTLY WHAT 'S NEEDED TO HELP REPAIR THE PART OF THE WORLD THAT WE CAN SEE AND TOUCH
KristaTippett_2010Z@576.4:579.1 STORIES LIKE THIS
KristaTippett_2010Z@579.1:582.23 SIGNS LIKE THIS
KristaTippett_2010Z@585.83:587.68 TO BRING COMPASSION
KristaTippett_2010Z@594.25:600.91 RACHEL NAOMI REMEN IS ACTUALLY BRINGING COMPASSION BACK TO ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE ALONGSIDE SCIENCE IN HER FIELD
KristaTippett_2010Z@604.24:623.68 AND THIS TREND OF WHAT RACHEL NAOMI REMEN IS DOING HOW THESE KINDS OF VIRTUES ARE FINDING A PLACE IN THE VOCABULARY OF MEDICINE THE WORK FRED LUSKIN IS DOING I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING DEVELOPMENTS OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THAT SCIENCE IN FACT IS TAKING A VIRTUE LIKE COMPASSION
KristaTippett_2010Z@623.68:626.08 DEFINITIVELY OUT OF THE REALM OF IDEALISM
KristaTippett_2010Z@626.08:631.39 THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE SCIENCE I BELIEVE AND IT WILL CHANGE RELIGION
KristaTippett_2010Z@631.39:638.78 BUT HERE 'S A FACE FROM TWENTIETH CENTURY SCIENCE THAT MIGHT SURPRISE YOU IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT COMPASSION
KristaTippett_2010Z@639.51:657.89 WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE ALBERT EINSTEIN WHO CAME UP WITH E EQUAL MC TWO WE DON 'T HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT THE EINSTEIN WHO INVITED THE AFRICAN AMERICAN OPERA SINGER MARIAN ANDERSON TO STAY IN HIS HOME WHEN SHE CAME TO SING IN PRINCETON BECAUSE THE BEST HOTEL THERE WAS SEGREGATED AND WOULDN 'T HAVE
KristaTippett_2010Z@668.26:675.24 EINSTEIN BELIEVED DEEPLY THAT SCIENCE SHOULD TRANSCEND NATIONAL AND ETHNIC DIVISIONS
KristaTippett_2010Z@675.24:690.2 BUT HE WATCHED PHYSICISTS AND CHEMISTS BECOME THE PURVEYORS OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY HE ONCE SAID THAT SCIENCE IN HIS GENERATION HAD BECOME LIKE A RAZOR BLADE IN THE HANDS OF A THREE YEAR OLD
KristaTippett_2010Z@690.2:700.84 AND EINSTEIN FORESAW THAT AS WE GROW MORE MODERN AND TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED WE NEED THE VIRTUES OUR TRADITIONS CARRY FORWARD IN TIME
KristaTippett_2010Z@708.06:715.72 SOME OF HIS FAVORITES WERE MOSES JESUS BUDDHA ST FRANCIS OF ASSISI GANDHI HE ADORED HIS CONTEMPORARY GANDHI
KristaTippett_2010Z@715.74:721.45 AND EINSTEIN SAID AND I THINK THIS IS A QUOTE AGAIN THAT HAS NOT BEEN PASSED DOWN IN HIS LEGACY
KristaTippett_2010Z@721.63:735.21 THAT THESE KINDS OF PEOPLE ARE GENIUSES IN THE ART OF LIVING MORE NECESSARY TO THE DIGNITY SECURITY AND JOY OF HUMANITY THAN THE DISCOVERERS OF OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE
KristaTippett_2010Z@735.36:749.15 NOW INVOKING EINSTEIN MIGHT NOT SEEM THE BEST WAY TO BRING COMPASSION DOWN TO EARTH AND MAKE IT SEEM ACCESSIBLE TO ALL THE REST OF US BUT ACTUALLY IT IS I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE REST OF THIS PHOTOGRAPH
KristaTippett_2010Z@750.32:769.09 BECAUSE THIS PHOTOGRAPH IS ANALOGOUS TO WHAT WE DO TO THE WORD COMPASSION IN OUR CULTURE WE CLEAN IT UP AND WE DIMINISH ITS DEPTHS AND ITS GROUNDING IN LIFE WHICH IS MESSY SO IN THIS PHOTOGRAPH YOU SEE A MIND LOOKING OUT A WINDOW AT WHAT MIGHT BE A CATHEDRAL IT 'S NOT
KristaTippett_2010Z@769.09:778.3 THIS IS THE FULL PHOTOGRAPH AND YOU SEE A MIDDLE AGED MAN WEARING A LEATHER JACKET SMOKING A CIGAR AND BY THE LOOK OF THAT PAUNCH HE HASN 'T BEEN DOING ENOUGH YOGA
KristaTippett_2010Z@778.83:785.67 WE PUT THESE TWO PHOTOGRAPHS SIDE BY SIDE ON OUR WEBSITE AND SOMEONE SAID WHEN I LOOK AT THE FIRST PHOTO I ASK MYSELF WHAT WAS HE THINKING
KristaTippett_2010Z@798.7:814.63 AND IT IS MUCH HARDER OFTEN TO BE COMPASSIONATE TOWARDS THOSE CLOSEST TO US WHICH IS ANOTHER QUALITY IN THE UNIVERSE OF COMPASSION ON ITS DARK SIDE THAT ALSO DESERVES OUR SERIOUS ATTENTION AND ILLUMINATION
KristaTippett_2010Z@815.91:826.27 GANDHI TOO WAS A REAL FLAWED HUMAN BEING SO WAS MARTIN LUTHER KING JR SO WAS DOROTHY DAY SO WAS MOTHER TERESA SO ARE WE ALL
KristaTippett_2010Z@826.27:837.57 AND I WANT TO SAY THAT IT IS A LIBERATING THING TO REALIZE THAT THAT IS NO OBSTACLE TO COMPASSION FOLLOWING ON WHAT FRED LUSKIN SAYS THAT THESE FLAWS JUST MAKE US HUMAN
KristaTippett_2010Z@838.38:854.07 OUR CULTURE IS OBSESSED WITH PERFECTION AND WITH HIDING PROBLEMS BUT WHAT A LIBERATING THING TO REALIZE THAT OUR PROBLEMS IN FACT ARE PROBABLY OUR RICHEST SOURCES FOR RISING TO THIS ULTIMATE VIRTUE OF COMPASSION
KristaTippett_2010Z@854.07:858.78 TOWARDS BRINGING COMPASSION TOWARDS THE SUFFERING AND JOYS OF OTHERS
KristaTippett_2010Z@860.01:871.52 RACHEL NAOMI REMEN IS A BETTER DOCTOR BECAUSE OF HER LIFE LONG STRUGGLE WITH CROHN 'S DISEASE EINSTEIN BECAME A HUMANITARIAN NOT BECAUSE OF HIS EXQUISITE KNOWLEDGE OF SPACE AND TIME AND MATTER
KristaTippett_2010Z@871.53:886.69 BUT BECAUSE HE WAS A JEW AS GERMANY GREW FASCIST AND KAREN ARMSTRONG I THINK YOU WOULD ALSO SAY THAT IT WAS SOME OF YOUR VERY WOUNDING EXPERIENCES IN A RELIGIOUS LIFE THAT WITH A ZIGZAG HAVE LED TO THE CHARTER FOR COMPASSION
KristaTippett_2010Z@894.69:897.63 SO I WANT TO PROPOSE
KristaTippett_2010Z@904.02:917.04 AND THAT WOULD BE FOR US TO CALL COMPASSION A SPIRITUAL TECHNOLOGY NOW OUR TRADITIONS CONTAIN VAST WISDOM ABOUT THIS AND WE NEED THEM TO MINE IT FOR US NOW BUT
