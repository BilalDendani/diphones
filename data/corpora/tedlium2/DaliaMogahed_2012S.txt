DaliaMogahed_2012S TODAY IS ABOUT SOMETHING MAYBE A COUPLE OF YOU HAVE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT
DaliaMogahed_2012S FROM OVAL OFFICES TO CENTRAL SQUARES
DaliaMogahed_2012S FROM CAREFULLY GUARDED AIRWAVES
DaliaMogahed_2012S TO OPEN SOURCE NETWORKS
DaliaMogahed_2012S BUT BEFORE TAHRIR WAS A GLOBAL SYMBOL OF LIBERATION THERE WERE REPRESENTATIVE SURVEYS
DaliaMogahed_2012S ALREADY GIVING PEOPLE A VOICE
DaliaMogahed_2012S MY TALK TODAY DRAWS ON THIS RESEARCH TO REVEAL
DaliaMogahed_2012S AND WHAT THEY WANT NOW
DaliaMogahed_2012S BUT I 'M GOING TO END BY WIDENING THE LENS TO THE ENTIRE REGION
DaliaMogahed_2012S TO LOOK AT THE MUNDANE TOPICS OF ARAB VIEWS OF RELIGION AND POLITICS
DaliaMogahed_2012S AND HOW THIS IMPACTS WOMEN
DaliaMogahed_2012S REVEALING SOME SURPRISES ALONG THE WAY
DaliaMogahed_2012S SO AFTER ANALYZING MOUNDS OF DATA
DaliaMogahed_2012S WHAT WE DISCOVERED WAS
DaliaMogahed_2012S UNEMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY ALONE
DaliaMogahed_2012S DID NOT LEAD TO THE ARAB REVOLTS OF TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN
DaliaMogahed_2012S IF AN ACT OF DESPERATION BY A TUNISIAN FRUIT VENDOR SPARKED THESE REVOLUTIONS
DaliaMogahed_2012S IT WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT ARABS EXPERIENCED AND WHAT THEY EXPECTED THAT PROVIDED THE FUEL
DaliaMogahed_2012S TO TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN CONSIDER THIS TREND IN EGYPT
DaliaMogahed_2012S ON PAPER THE COUNTRY WAS DOING GREAT
DaliaMogahed_2012S IN FACT IT ATTRACTED ACCOLADES FROM MULTINATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE OF ITS ECONOMIC GROWTH
DaliaMogahed_2012S BUT UNDER THE SURFACE WAS A VERY DIFFERENT REALITY
DaliaMogahed_2012S IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN RIGHT BEFORE THE REVOLUTION EVEN THOUGH GDP PER CAPITA HAD BEEN GROWING AT FIVE PERCENT FOR SEVERAL YEARS EGYPTIANS HAD NEVER FELT WORSE ABOUT THEIR LIVES
DaliaMogahed_2012S NOT SURPRISINGLY PEOPLE FEEL BETTER AS THEIR COUNTRY GETS RICHER
