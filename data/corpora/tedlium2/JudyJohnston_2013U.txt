JudyJohnston_2013U@34.74:41.55 WHAT I KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC COMES FROM A QUALITATIVE STUDY WITH A SAMPLE SIZE OF TWO
JudyJohnston_2013U@41.55:57.48 IN THE LAST FEW YEARS I HELPED TWO FRIENDS HAVE THE END OF LIFE THEY WANTED JIM AND SHIRLEY MODINI SPENT THEIR SIXTY EIGHT YEARS OF MARRIAGE LIVING OFF THE GRID ON THEIR ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED ACRE RANCH IN THE MOUNTAINS OF SONOMA COUNTY THEY KEPT JUST ENOUGH LIVESTOCK TO MAKE ENDS MEET
JudyJohnston_2013U@57.48:67.48 SO THAT THE MAJORITY OF THEIR RANCH WOULD REMAIN A REFUGE FOR THE BEARS AND LIONS AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT LIVED THERE THIS WAS THEIR DREAM
JudyJohnston_2013U@67.48:83.6 I MET JIM AND SHIRLEY IN THEIR EIGHTY S THEY WERE BOTH ONLY CHILDREN WHO CHOSE NOT TO HAVE KIDS AS WE BECAME FRIENDS I BECAME THEIR TRUSTEE AND THEIR MEDICAL ADVOCATE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I BECAME THE PERSON WHO MANAGED THEIR END OF LIFE EXPERIENCES
JudyJohnston_2013U@99.53:117.55 WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WITH A PLAN AND THE RIGHT PEOPLE QUALITY OF LIFE CAN REMAIN HIGH THE BEGINNING OF THE END IS TRIGGERED BY A MORTALITY AWARENESS EVENT AND DURING THIS TIME JIM AND SHIRLEY CHOSE ACR NATURE PRESERVES TO TAKE THEIR RANCH OVER WHEN THEY WERE
JudyJohnston_2013U@137.31:141.08 DYING FROM CANCER AND DYING FROM NEUROLOGICAL ILLNESS ARE DIFFERENT
JudyJohnston_2013U@141.08:155.11 IN BOTH CASES LAST DAYS ARE ABOUT QUIET REASSURANCE JIM DIED FIRST HE WAS CONSCIOUS UNTIL THE VERY END BUT ON HIS LAST DAY HE COULDN 'T TALK THROUGH HIS EYES WE KNEW WHEN HE NEEDED TO HEAR AGAIN IT IS ALL SET JIM
JudyJohnston_2013U@190.84:208.74 A PLAN INVOLVES ANSWERING STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE END YOU WANT WHERE DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU 'RE NO LONGER INDEPENDENT WHAT DO YOU WANT IN TERMS OF MEDICAL INTERVENTION AND WHO 'S GOING TO MAKE SURE YOUR PLAN IS FOLLOWED YOU WILL NEED ADVOCATES HAVING MORE THAN ONE INCREASES YOUR CHANCE OF GETTING THE END YOU WANT
JudyJohnston_2013U@208.74:226.54 DON 'T ASSUME THE NATURAL CHOICE IS YOUR SPOUSE OR CHILD YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO HAS THE TIME AND PROXIMITY TO DO THIS JOB WELL AND YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO CAN WORK WITH PEOPLE UNDER THE PRESSURE OF AN EVER CHANGING SITUATION HOSPITAL READINESS IS CRITICAL YOU ARE LIKELY TO BE HEADED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND YOU WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT
JudyJohnston_2013U@226.54:244.75 PREPARE A ONE PAGE SUMMARY OF YOUR MEDICAL HISTORY MEDICATIONS AND PHYSICIAN INFORMATION PUT THIS IN A REALLY BRIGHT ENVELOPE WITH COPIES OF YOUR INSURANCE CARDS YOUR POWER OF ATTORNEY AND YOUR DO NOT RESUSCITATE ORDER HAVE ADVOCATES KEEP A SET IN THEIR CAR TAPE A SET TO YOUR REFRIGERATOR WHEN YOU SHOW UP IN THE E R WITH THIS PACKET
JudyJohnston_2013U@244.75:248.32 YOUR ADMISSION IS STREAMLINED IN A MATERIAL WAY
JudyJohnston_2013U@248.32:259.89 YOU 'RE GOING TO NEED CAREGIVERS YOU 'LL NEED TO ASSESS YOUR PERSONALITY AND FINANCIAL SITUATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN ELDER CARE COMMUNITY OR STAYING AT HOME IS YOUR BEST CHOICE
JudyJohnston_2013U@293.01:299.84 WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR AT THE VERY END AND FROM WHOM WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR IT IN MY EXPERIENCE YOU 'LL WANT TO HEAR
JudyJohnston_2013U@299.84:303.02 THAT WHATEVER YOU 'RE WORRIED ABOUT IS GOING TO BE
JudyJohnston_2013U@303.02:306.84 WHEN YOU BELIEVE IT 'S OKAY TO LET GO YOU WILL
JudyJohnston_2013U@306.84:313.41 SO THIS IS A TOPIC THAT NORMALLY INSPIRES FEAR AND DENIAL
JudyJohnston_2013U@329.93:337.47 CELEBRATING A BIRTHDAY HE DIDN 'T EXPECT TO SEE AND HERE 'S SHIRLEY JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE SHE DIED
