KenGoldberg_2012X KNOW THIS IS GOING TO SOUND STRANGE BUT I THINK ROBOTS CAN INSPIRE US TO BE BETTER HUMANS
KenGoldberg_2012X SEE I GREW UP IN BETHLEHEM PENNSYLVANIA THE HOME OF BETHLEHEM STEEL
KenGoldberg_2012X MY FATHER WAS AN ENGINEER AND WHEN I WAS GROWING UP HE WOULD TEACH ME HOW THINGS WORKED WE WOULD BUILD PROJECTS TOGETHER LIKE MODEL ROCKETS AND SLOT CARS HERE 'S THE GO KART THAT WE BUILT TOGETHER THAT 'S ME BEHIND THE WHEEL
KenGoldberg_2012X AND ONE DAY
KenGoldberg_2012X HE CAME HOME WHEN I WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD AND AT THE DINNER TABLE HE ANNOUNCED THAT FOR OUR NEXT PROJECT WE WERE GOING TO BUILD
KenGoldberg_2012X A ROBOT A ROBOT
KenGoldberg_2012X NOW I WAS THRILLED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE AT SCHOOL THERE WAS A BULLY NAMED KEVIN AND HE WAS PICKING ON ME BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY JEWISH KID IN CLASS SO I COULDN 'T WAIT TO GET STARTED TO WORK ON THIS SO I COULD INTRODUCE KEVIN TO MY ROBOT
KenGoldberg_2012X HE OWNED A CHROMIUM PLATING COMPANY AND THEY HAD TO MOVE HEAVY STEEL PARTS BETWEEN TANKS OF CHEMICALS AND SO HE NEEDED AN INDUSTRIAL ROBOT LIKE THIS THAT COULD BASICALLY DO THE HEAVY LIFTING
KenGoldberg_2012X BUT MY DAD DIDN 'T GET THE KIND OF ROBOT HE WANTED EITHER HE AND I WORKED ON IT FOR SEVERAL YEARS BUT IT WAS THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY S AND THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO AMATEURS JUST WASN 'T THERE YET
KenGoldberg_2012X SO DAD CONTINUED TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK BY HAND AND A FEW YEARS LATER HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER
KenGoldberg_2012X YOU SEE
KenGoldberg_2012X HE DIDN 'T RECOGNIZE THAT AT THE TIME
KenGoldberg_2012X AND HE CONTRACTED LEUKEMIA AND HE DIED AT THE AGE OF FORTY FIVE I WAS DEVASTATED BY THIS AND I NEVER FORGOT THE ROBOT THAT HE AND I TRIED TO BUILD
KenGoldberg_2012X WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE I DECIDED TO STUDY ENGINEERING LIKE HIM AND I WENT TO CARNEGIE MELLON AND I EARNED MY PHD IN ROBOTICS I 'VE BEEN STUDYING ROBOTS EVER SINCE
KenGoldberg_2012X SO WHAT I 'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT
KenGoldberg_2012X AND THIS WAS THE YEAR THAT THE WORLD WIDE WEB CAME OUT AND I REMEMBER MY STUDENTS WERE THE ONES WHO TOLD ME ABOUT IT AND WE WOULD WE WERE JUST AMAZED WE STARTED PLAYING WITH THIS AND THAT AFTERNOON WE REALIZED THAT WE COULD USE THIS NEW UNIVERSAL INTERFACE
KenGoldberg_2012X AND WE HAD PUT A CAMERA IN THE GRIPPER OF THE HAND OF THE ROBOT AND WE WROTE SOME SPECIAL SCRIPTS AND SOFTWARE SO THAT ANYONE IN THE WORLD COULD COME IN AND BY CLICKING ON THE SCREEN THEY COULD MOVE THE ROBOT AROUND AND VISIT THE GARDEN
KenGoldberg_2012X BUT WE ALSO ALLOWED SET UP SOME OTHER SOFTWARE THAT LETS YOU PARTICIPATE AND HELP US WATER THE GARDEN REMOTELY
KenGoldberg_2012X AND IF YOU WATER IT A FEW TIMES WE 'D GIVE YOU YOUR OWN SEED TO PLANT NOW THIS WAS A PROJECT AN ENGINEERING PROJECT AND WE PUBLISHED SOME PAPERS ON THE DESIGN THE SYSTEM DESIGN OF IT BUT WE ALSO THOUGHT OF IT AS AN ART INSTALLATION
KenGoldberg_2012X LOBBY AND I 'M HAPPY TO SAY IT REMAINED ONLINE THERE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY FOR ALMOST NINE YEARS THAT ROBOT WAS OPERATED BY MORE PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER ROBOT IN HISTORY
KenGoldberg_2012X NOW ONE DAY I GOT A CALL OUT OF THE BLUE FROM A STUDENT
KenGoldberg_2012X WHO ASKED A VERY SIMPLE BUT PROFOUND QUESTION HE SAID IS THE ROBOT REAL
KenGoldberg_2012X NOW EVERYONE ELSE HAD ASSUMED IT WAS AND WE KNEW IT WAS BECAUSE WE WERE WORKING WITH IT BUT I KNEW WHAT HE MEANT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE
KenGoldberg_2012X TO TAKE A BUNCH OF PICTURES OF FLOWERS IN A GARDEN AND THEN BASICALLY INDEX THEM IN A COMPUTER SYSTEM SUCH THAT IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THERE WAS A REAL ROBOT WHEN THERE WASN 'T
KenGoldberg_2012X AND THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT I COULDN 'T THINK OF A GOOD ANSWER FOR HOW HE COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE
KenGoldberg_2012X THIS WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE TIME THAT I WAS OFFERED A POSITION HERE AT BERKELEY AND WHEN I GOT HERE I LOOKED UP HUBERT DREYFUS WHO 'S A WORLD RENOWNED PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY
KenGoldberg_2012X AND I TALKED WITH HIM ABOUT THIS AND HE SAID THIS IS ONE OF THE OLDEST AND MOST CENTRAL PROBLEMS IN PHILOSOPHY IT GOES BACK TO THE SKEPTICS AND UP THROUGH DESCARTES IT 'S THE ISSUE OF
KenGoldberg_2012X OF HOW DO WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS TRUE SO HE AND I STARTED WORKING TOGETHER AND WE COINED A NEW TERM TELEPISTEMOLOGY
KenGoldberg_2012X THE STUDY OF KNOWLEDGE AT A DISTANCE WE INVITED LEADING ARTISTS ENGINEERS AND PHILOSOPHERS TO WRITE ESSAYS ABOUT THIS AND THE RESULTS THE RESULTS ARE COLLECTED IN THIS BOOK FROM MIT PRESS
KenGoldberg_2012X SO THANKS TO THIS STUDENT WHO QUESTIONED WHAT EVERYONE ELSE HAD ASSUMED TO BE TRUE THIS PROJECT TAUGHT ME AN IMPORTANT LESSON ABOUT LIFE WHICH IS TO ALWAYS QUESTION ASSUMPTIONS
KenGoldberg_2012X NOW THE SECOND PROJECT I 'LL TELL YOU ABOUT GREW OUT OF THE TELEGARDEN
KenGoldberg_2012X AS IT WAS OPERATING MY STUDENTS AND I WERE VERY INTERESTED IN HOW PEOPLE WERE INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER AND WHAT THEY WERE DOING WITH THE GARDEN SO WE STARTED THINKING WHAT IF THE ROBOT COULD LEAVE THE GARDEN AND GO OUT INTO SOME OTHER INTERESTING ENVIRONMENT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IF IT COULD GO TO A DINNER PARTY
KenGoldberg_2012X AT THE WHITE HOUSE LAUGHTER SO
KenGoldberg_2012X BECAUSE WE WERE INTERESTED MORE IN THE SYSTEM DESIGN AND THE USER INTERFACE THAN IN THE HARDWARE WE DECIDED THAT RATHER THAN HAVE A ROBOT REPLACE THE HUMAN TO GO TO THE PARTY WE 'D HAVE A HUMAN REPLACE THE ROBOT
KenGoldberg_2012X WE CALLED IT THE TELE ACTOR WE GOT A HUMAN SOMEONE WHO 'S VERY OUTGOING AND GREGARIOUS AND SHE WAS OUTFITTED WITH A HELMET WITH VARIOUS EQUIPMENT CAMERAS AND MICROPHONES AND THEN A BACKPACK
KenGoldberg_2012X WITH WIRELESS INTERNET CONNECTION AND THE IDEA WAS THAT SHE COULD GO INTO A REMOTE AND INTERESTING ENVIRONMENT AND THEN OVER THE INTERNET PEOPLE COULD EXPERIENCE WHAT SHE WAS EXPERIENCING
KenGoldberg_2012X SO THEY COULD SEE WHAT SHE WAS SEEING BUT THEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY COULD PARTICIPATE BY INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER
KenGoldberg_2012X AND COMING UP WITH IDEAS ABOUT WHAT SHE SHOULD DO NEXT AND WHERE SHE SHOULD GO
KenGoldberg_2012X AND THEN CONVEYING THOSE TO THE TELE ACTOR SO WE GOT A CHANCE TO TAKE THE TELE ACTOR TO THE WEBBY AWARDS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THAT YEAR SAM DONALDSON WAS THE HOST
KenGoldberg_2012X I SAID THE TELE ACTOR IS GOING TO BE JOINING YOU ON STAGE AND THIS IS A NEW EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT AND PEOPLE ARE WATCHING HER ON THEIR SCREENS AND SHE 'S GOT THERE 'S CAMERAS INVOLVED AND THERE 'S MICROPHONES AND SHE 'S GOT AN EARBUD IN HER EAR AND PEOPLE OVER THE NETWORK ARE GIVING HER ADVICE ABOUT WHAT TO DO NEXT AND HE SAID WAIT A SECOND
KenGoldberg_2012X THAT 'S WHAT I DO
KenGoldberg_2012X SO HE LOVED THE CONCEPT AND WHEN THE TELE ACTOR WALKED ONSTAGE SHE WALKED RIGHT UP TO HIM AND SHE GAVE HIM A BIG KISS RIGHT ON THE LIPS
KenGoldberg_2012X THAT THEY WOULD GIVE A KISS TO SAM DONALDSON AND SHE SAID THEY HADN 'T
KenGoldberg_2012X SO THE SUCCESS OF THE TELE ACTOR THAT NIGHT WAS DUE TO THE FACT
KenGoldberg_2012X HE WAS UNDERGOING A TREATMENT CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENTS AND THERE 'S A RELATED TREATMENT CALLED BRACHYTHERAPY WHERE TINY RADIOACTIVE SEEDS ARE PLACED INTO THE BODY TO TREAT CANCEROUS TUMORS
KenGoldberg_2012X AND THE WAY IT 'S DONE AS YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THAT SURGEONS INSERT NEEDLES INTO THE BODY TO DELIVER THE SEEDS AND ALL THIS ALL THESE NEEDLES ARE INSERTED IN PARALLEL
KenGoldberg_2012X SO IT 'S VERY COMMON THAT SOME OF THE NEEDLES PENETRATE SENSITIVE ORGANS AND AS A RESULT THE NEEDLES
KenGoldberg_2012X DAMAGE THESE ORGANS CAUSE DAMAGE WHICH LEADS TO TRAUMA AND SIDE EFFECTS SO MY STUDENTS AND I WONDERED
KenGoldberg_2012X WHAT IF WE COULD MODIFY THE SYSTEM SO THAT THE NEEDLES COULD COME IN AT DIFFERENT ANGLES
KenGoldberg_2012X SO WE SIMULATED THIS AND WE DEVELOPED SOME OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS AND WE SIMULATED THIS AND WE WERE ABLE TO SHOW THAT WE ARE ABLE TO AVOID THE DELICATE ORGANS AND YET STILL ACHIEVE THE COVERAGE OF THE TUMORS WITH THE RADIATION
KenGoldberg_2012X SO NOW WE 'RE WORKING WITH DOCTORS AT UCSF AND ENGINEERS AT JOHNS HOPKINS AND WE 'RE BUILDING A ROBOT
KenGoldberg_2012X THAT HAS A NUMBER OF IT 'S A SPECIALIZED DESIGN WITH DIFFERENT JOINTS THAT CAN ALLOW THE NEEDLES TO COME IN AT AN INFINITE VARIETY OF ANGLES AND AS YOU CAN SEE HERE THEY CAN AVOID DELICATE ORGANS AND STILL REACH THE TARGETS THEY 'RE AIMING FOR
KenGoldberg_2012X SO BY QUESTIONING THIS ASSUMPTION THAT ALL THE NEEDLES HAVE TO BE PARALLEL
KenGoldberg_2012X THIS PROJECT ALSO TAUGHT ME AN IMPORTANT LESSON WHEN IN DOUBT WHEN YOUR PATH IS BLOCKED PIVOT
KenGoldberg_2012X AND THE LAST PROJECT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH MEDICAL ROBOTICS AND THIS IS
KenGoldberg_2012X SOMETHING THAT 'S GROWN OUT OF A SYSTEM CALLED THE DA VINCI SURGICAL ROBOT AND THIS IS A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE DEVICE IT 'S BEING USED IN OVER TWO THOUSAND HOSPITALS AROUND THE WORLD AND THE IDEA IS IT ALLOWS THE SURGEON TO OPERATE
KenGoldberg_2012X AND WE 'VE BEEN WONDERING WHAT IF WE COULD PROGRAM THE ROBOT TO PERFORM SOME OF THESE SUBTASKS AND THEREBY FREE THE SURGEONS TO FOCUS ON THE MORE COMPLICATED PARTS OF THE SURGERY AND ALSO CUT DOWN ON THE TIME THAT THE SURGERY WOULD TAKE IF WE COULD GET THE ROBOT TO DO THEM A LITTLE BIT FASTER
KenGoldberg_2012X FROM EXAMPLE SO HE 'S GOTTEN ROBOTS TO FLY HELICOPTERS DO INCREDIBLY INTERESTING BEAUTIFUL ACROBATICS BY WATCHING HUMAN EXPERTS FLY THEM
KenGoldberg_2012X SO WE GOT ONE OF THESE ROBOTS WE STARTED WORKING WITH PIETER AND HIS STUDENTS AND WE ASKED A SURGEON TO PERFORM
KenGoldberg_2012X SO HERE 'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN THE ROBOT THIS IS WHAT THE ROBOT 'S PATH LOOKS LIKE THOSE THREE EXAMPLES NOW THOSE ARE MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT A NOVICE LIKE I COULD DO BUT THEY 'RE STILL JERKY AND IMPRECISE SO WE RECORD ALL THESE EXAMPLES THE DATA
KenGoldberg_2012X AND THEN WE GO THROUGH A SEQUENCE OF STEPS FIRST WE USED A TECHNIQUE CALLED DYNAMIC TIME WARPING FROM SPEECH RECOGNITION AND THIS ALLOWS US TO TEMPORALLY ALIGN ALL OF THE EXAMPLES AND THEN WE APPLY KALMAN FILTERING
KenGoldberg_2012X A TECHNIQUE FROM CONTROL THEORY THAT ALLOWS US TO STATISTICALLY ANALYZE ALL THE NOISE AND EXTRACT THE DESIRED TRAJECTORY THAT UNDERLIES THEM
KenGoldberg_2012X NOW SO WHAT WE 'RE DOING IS THAT WE TAKE THOSE HUMAN DEMONSTRATIONS THEY 'RE ALL NOISY AND IMPERFECT AND WE EXTRACT FROM THEM AN INFERRED TASK TRAJECTORY AND CONTROL SEQUENCE FOR THE ROBOT WE THEN EXECUTE THAT ON THE ROBOT WE OBSERVE WHAT HAPPENS
KenGoldberg_2012X THEN WE ADJUST THE CONTROLS USING A SEQUENCE OF TECHNIQUES CALLED ITERATIVE LEARNING
KenGoldberg_2012X THEN WHAT WE DO IS WE INCREASE THE VELOCITY A LITTLE BIT WE OBSERVE THE RESULTS ADJUST THE CONTROLS AGAIN
KenGoldberg_2012X AND HERE 'S THE ROBOT OPERATING AT TEN
KenGoldberg_2012X SO THIS PROJECT ALSO BECAUSE OF ITS INVOLVED PRACTICING AND LEARNING DOING SOMETHING OVER AND OVER AGAIN THIS PROJECT ALSO HAS A LESSON WHICH IS IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING WELL THERE 'S NO SUBSTITUTE FOR PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE
KenGoldberg_2012X SO THESE ARE FOUR OF THE LESSONS THAT I 'VE LEARNED FROM ROBOTS OVER THE YEARS
KenGoldberg_2012X A DAUGHTER NAMED ODESSA SHE 'S EIGHT YEARS OLD AND SHE LIKES ROBOTS TOO MAYBE IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY LAUGHTER I WISH SHE COULD MEET MY DAD
KenGoldberg_2012X AND NOW I GET TO TEACH HER HOW THINGS WORK AND WE GET TO BUILD PROJECTS TOGETHER AND I WONDER WHAT KIND OF LESSONS THAT SHE 'LL LEARN FROM THEM
KenGoldberg_2012X ROBOTS ARE THE MOST HUMAN OF OUR MACHINES THEY CAN 'T SOLVE ALL OF THE WORLD 'S PROBLEMS BUT I THINK THEY HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO TEACH US I INVITE ALL OF YOU
KenGoldberg_2012X TO THINK ABOUT THE INNOVATIONS THAT YOU 'RE INTERESTED IN THE MACHINES THAT YOU WISH FOR
KenGoldberg_2012X AND THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY MIGHT BE TELLING YOU
