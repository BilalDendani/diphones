JonathanEisen_2012P@16.56:27.15 STORY SO I GREW UP IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD I WENT FROM BEING WHAT I THINK WAS A STRAPPING YOUNG ATHLETE OVER FOUR MONTHS
JonathanEisen_2012P@27.16:33.09 SLOWLY WASTING AWAY UNTIL I WAS BASICALLY A FAMINE VICTIM WITH AN UNQUENCHABLE THIRST
JonathanEisen_2012P@33.09:50.59 I HAD BASICALLY DIGESTED AWAY MY BODY AND THIS ALL CAME TO A HEAD WHEN I WAS ON A BACKPACKING TRIP MY FIRST ONE EVER ACTUALLY ON OLD RAG MOUNTAIN IN WEST VIRGINIA AND WAS PUTTING MY FACE INTO PUDDLES OF WATER AND DRINKING LIKE A DOG
JonathanEisen_2012P@50.71:58.32 THAT NIGHT I WAS TAKEN INTO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND DIAGNOSED AS A TYPE ONE DIABETIC IN FULL BLOWN KETOACIDOSIS
JonathanEisen_2012P@58.32:74.7 AND I RECOVERED THANKS TO THE MIRACLES OF MODERN MEDICINE INSULIN AND OTHER THINGS AND GAINED ALL MY WEIGHT BACK AND MORE AND SOMETHING FESTERED INSIDE ME AFTER THIS HAPPENED
JonathanEisen_2012P@74.7:81.68 WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT WAS WHAT CAUSED THE DIABETES YOU SEE DIABETES IS AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE WHERE YOUR BODY FIGHTS ITSELF
JonathanEisen_2012P@81.81:96.37 AND AT THE TIME PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT SOMEHOW MAYBE EXPOSURE TO A PATHOGEN HAD TRIGGERED MY IMMUNE SYSTEM TO FIGHT THE PATHOGEN AND THEN KILL THE CELLS THAT MAKE INSULIN AND THIS IS WHAT I THOUGHT FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND THAT 'S IN FACT WHAT
JonathanEisen_2012P@96.5:105 MEDICINE AND PEOPLE HAVE FOCUSED ON QUITE A BIT THE MICROBES THAT DO BAD THINGS AND THAT 'S WHERE I NEED MY ASSISTANT HERE NOW
JonathanEisen_2012P@105.32:107.7 YOU MAY RECOGNIZE HER
JonathanEisen_2012P@108.74:124.66 SO I WENT YESTERDAY I APOLOGIZE I SKIPPED A FEW OF THE TALKS AND I WENT OVER TO THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES BUILDING AND THEY SELL TOYS GIANT MICROBES AND HERE WE GO
JonathanEisen_2012P@125.16:133.35 SO YOU HAVE CAUGHT FLESH EATING DISEASE IF YOU CAUGHT THAT ONE I GOTTA GET BACK OUT MY BASEBALL ABILITY HERE
JonathanEisen_2012P@139.95:152.34 UNFORTUNATELY OR NOT SURPRISINGLY MOST OF THE MICROBES THEY SELL AT THE NATIONAL ACADEMY BUILDING ARE PATHOGENS EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT 'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
JonathanEisen_2012P@158.78:170.31 DO US GOOD MUCH OF THE TIME RATHER THAN KILLING US AND SO WE 'VE KNOWN ABOUT THIS FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME PEOPLE HAVE USED MICROSCOPES TO LOOK AT THE MICROBES THAT COVER US I KNOW YOU 'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO ME BUT
JonathanEisen_2012P@189.38:194.9 WE ARE LITERALLY A TEEMING ECOSYSTEM OF MICROORGANISMS AND
JonathanEisen_2012P@195.06:206.61 UNFORTUNATELY IF YOU WANT TO LEARN ABOUT THE MICROORGANISMS JUST LOOKING AT THEM IN A MICROSCOPE IS NOT SUFFICIENT AND SO WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THE DNA SEQUENCING IT TURNS OUT THAT ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO LOOK AT MICROBES AND TO UNDERSTAND THEM
JonathanEisen_2012P@206.61:215.48 IS TO LOOK AT THEIR DNA AND THAT 'S WHAT I 'VE BEEN DOING FOR TWENTY YEARS USING DNA SEQUENCING COLLECTING SAMPLES FROM VARIOUS PLACES INCLUDING THE HUMAN BODY
JonathanEisen_2012P@215.48:221.93 READING THE DNA SEQUENCE AND THEN USING THAT DNA SEQUENCING TO TELL US ABOUT THE MICROBES THAT ARE IN A PARTICULAR PLACE
JonathanEisen_2012P@221.93:234.33 AND WHAT 'S AMAZING WHEN YOU USE THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE LOOKING AT HUMANS WE 'RE NOT JUST COVERED IN A SEA OF MICROBES THERE ARE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF MICROBES ON US
JonathanEisen_2012P@234.33:247 WE HAVE MILLIONS OF GENES OF MICROBES IN OUR HUMAN MICROBIOME COVERING US AND SO THIS MICROBIAL DIVERSITY DIFFERS BETWEEN PEOPLE AND WHAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IN THE LAST
JonathanEisen_2012P@247.26:258.12 TEN MAYBE FIFTEEN YEARS IS MAYBE THESE MICROBES THIS MICROBIAL CLOUD IN AND ON US AND THE VARIATION BETWEEN US MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THE HEALTH
JonathanEisen_2012P@258.26:275.24 AND ILLNESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN US AND THAT COMES BACK TO THE DIABETES STORY I WAS TELLING YOU IT TURNS OUT THAT PEOPLE NOW THINK THAT ONE OF THE TRIGGERS FOR TYPE ONE DIABETES IS NOT FIGHTING A PATHOGEN BUT IS IN FACT TRYING TO MISCOMMUNICATING WITH THE MICROBES THAT LIVE IN AND ON YOU
JonathanEisen_2012P@275.24:279.2 AND SOMEHOW MAYBE THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY THAT 'S IN AND ON ME GOT OFF
JonathanEisen_2012P@279.25:286.72 AND THEN THIS TRIGGERED SOME SORT OF IMMUNE RESPONSE AND LED TO ME KILLING THE CELLS THAT MAKE INSULIN IN MY BODY
JonathanEisen_2012P@286.72:298.46 AND SO WHAT I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT FOR A FEW MINUTES IS WHAT PEOPLE HAVE LEARNED USING DNA SEQUENCING TECHNIQUES IN PARTICULAR TO STUDY THE MICROBIAL CLOUD THAT LIVES IN AND ON US
JonathanEisen_2012P@298.46:316.83 AND I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT A PERSONAL PROJECT MY FIRST PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH STUDYING THE MICROBES ON THE HUMAN BODY ACTUALLY CAME FROM A TALK THAT I GAVE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER FROM HERE AT GEORGETOWN I GAVE A TALK AND A FAMILY FRIEND WHO HAPPENED TO BE THE DEAN OF GEORGETOWN MEDICAL SCHOOL WAS AT THE TALK AND CAME UP TO ME AFTERWARDS SAYING
JonathanEisen_2012P@316.83:321.13 THEY WERE DOING A STUDY OF ILEAL TRANSPLANTS IN PEOPLE
JonathanEisen_2012P@321.13:323.42 AND THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT THE MICROBES
JonathanEisen_2012P@323.42:325.15 AFTER THE TRANSPLANTS
JonathanEisen_2012P@325.15:335.94 AND SO I STARTED A COLLABORATION WITH THIS PERSON MICHAEL ZASLOFF AND THOMAS FISHBEIN TO LOOK AT THE MICROBES THAT COLONIZED THESE ILEA AFTER THEY WERE TRANSPLANTED INTO A RECIPIENT
JonathanEisen_2012P@335.94:345.32 AND I CAN TELL YOU ALL THE DETAILS ABOUT THE MICROBIAL STUDY THAT WE DID THERE BUT THE REASON I WANT TO TELL YOU THIS STORY IS SOMETHING REALLY STRIKING THAT THEY DID AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROJECT
JonathanEisen_2012P@347.3:355.14 WHICH IS FILLED WITH MICROBES FROM A DONOR AND THEY HAVE A RECIPIENT WHO MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR MICROBIAL COMMUNITY SAY CROHN 'S DISEASE
JonathanEisen_2012P@355.14:362.79 AND THEY STERILIZED THE DONOR ILEUM CLEANED OUT ALL THE MICROBES AND THEN PUT IT IN THE RECIPIENT
JonathanEisen_2012P@362.79:368.61 THEY DID THIS BECAUSE THIS WAS COMMON PRACTICE IN MEDICINE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS OBVIOUS
JonathanEisen_2012P@368.61:377.52 THAT THIS WAS NOT A GOOD IDEA AND FORTUNATELY IN THE COURSE OF THIS PROJECT THE TRANSPLANT SURGEONS AND THE OTHER PEOPLE DECIDED
JonathanEisen_2012P@377.54:393.1 FORGET COMMON PRACTICE WE HAVE TO SWITCH SO THEY ACTUALLY SWITCHED TO LEAVING SOME OF THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY IN THE ILEUM THEY LEAVE THE MICROBES WITH THE DONOR AND THEORETICALLY THAT MIGHT HELP THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RECEIVING THIS
JonathanEisen_2012P@410.57:424.75 AND WHEN PEOPLE HAVE DONE A VARIETY OF STUDIES THEY HAVE LEARNED THINGS SUCH AS WHEN A BABY IS BORN DURING VAGINAL DELIVERY YOU GET COLONIZED BY THE MICROBES FROM YOUR MOTHER THERE ARE RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH CESAREAN SECTIONS
JonathanEisen_2012P@424.75:434.3 SOME OF THOSE RISK FACTORS MAY BE DUE TO MIS COLONIZATION WHEN YOU CARVE A BABY OUT OF ITS MOTHER RATHER THAN BEING DELIVERED THROUGH THE BIRTH CANAL
JonathanEisen_2012P@434.3:452.7 AND A VARIETY OF OTHER STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY THAT LIVES IN AND ON US HELPS IN DEVELOPMENT OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM HELPS IN FIGHTING OFF PATHOGENS HELPS IN OUR METABOLISM AND DETERMINING OUR METABOLIC RATE PROBABLY DETERMINES OUR ODOR AND MAY EVEN SHAPE OUR BEHAVIOR
JonathanEisen_2012P@466.34:476.42 AND ONE AREA THAT I THINK IS VERY INTERESTING WHICH MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE NOW THAT WE 'VE THROWN MICROBES INTO THE CROWD IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD CALL GERMOPHOBIA
JonathanEisen_2012P@476.42:492.71 SO PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTO CLEANLINESS RIGHT WE HAVE ANTIBIOTICS IN OUR KITCHEN COUNTERS PEOPLE ARE WASHING EVERY PART OF THEM ALL OF THE TIME WE PUMP ANTIBIOTICS INTO OUR FOOD INTO OUR COMMUNITIES WE TAKE ANTIBIOTICS EXCESSIVELY
JonathanEisen_2012P@495.77:504.27 BUT WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN WE PUMP CHEMICALS AND ANTIBIOTICS INTO OUR WORLD THAT WE 'RE ALSO KILLING THE CLOUD OF MICROBES THAT LIVE IN AND ON US
JonathanEisen_2012P@504.27:517.73 AND EXCESSIVE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS IN PARTICULAR IN CHILDREN HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH AGAIN RISK FACTORS FOR OBESITY FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES FOR A VARIETY OF PROBLEMS THAT ARE PROBABLY DUE TO DISRUPTION OF
JonathanEisen_2012P@518.07:520.86 THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY SO
JonathanEisen_2012P@520.88:527.24 THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY CAN GO WRONG WHETHER WE WANT IT TO OR NOT OR WE CAN KILL IT WITH ANTIBIOTICS
JonathanEisen_2012P@532.25:545.76 PROBIOTICS ARE ONE THING THAT YOU CAN TRY AND DO TO RESTORE THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY THAT IS IN AND ON YOU AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES THERE 'S A PROJECT GOING ON AT UC DAVIS WHERE PEOPLE ARE USING PROBIOTICS TO TRY AND TREAT
JonathanEisen_2012P@545.76:560.5 PREVENT NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS IN PREMATURE INFANTS PREMATURE INFANTS HAVE REAL PROBLEMS WITH THEIR MICROBIAL COMMUNITY AND IT MAY BE THAT PROBIOTICS CAN HELP PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS HORRIBLE NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS IN THESE PREMATURE INFANTS
JonathanEisen_2012P@560.5:576.36 BUT PROBIOTICS ARE SORT OF A VERY VERY SIMPLE SOLUTION MOST OF THE PILLS THAT YOU CAN TAKE OR THE YOGURTS THAT YOU CAN EAT HAVE ONE OR TWO SPECIES IN THEM MAYBE FIVE SPECIES IN THEM AND THE HUMAN COMMUNITY IS THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF SPECIES
JonathanEisen_2012P@576.36:586.16 SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO RESTORE OUR MICROBIAL COMMUNITY WHEN WE HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SPECIES ON US WELL ONE THING THAT ANIMALS SEEM TO DO IS
JonathanEisen_2012P@586.16:588.36 THEY EAT POO
JonathanEisen_2012P@599.29:609.31 NOT BOOTY BUT POO TEA TO TREAT COLIC AND OTHER AILMENTS IN HORSES AND COWS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHERE YOU MAKE
JonathanEisen_2012P@609.31:614.92 TEA FROM THE POO FROM A HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL ANIMAL AND YOU FEED IT TO A SICK
JonathanEisen_2012P@614.92:632.87 ANIMAL ALTHOUGH UNLESS YOU HAVE A FISTULATED COW WITH A BIG HOLE IN ITS SIDE AND YOU CAN PUT YOUR HAND INTO ITS RUMEN IT 'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT THE DELIVERY OF MICROBES DIRECTLY INTO THE MOUTH AND THROUGH THE ENTIRE TOP OF THE DIGESTIVE TRACT IS THE BEST DELIVERY SYSTEM
JonathanEisen_2012P@632.87:637.27 SO YOU MAY HAVE HEARD IN PEOPLE THEY ARE NOW DOING
JonathanEisen_2012P@637.27:643.98 FECAL TRANSPLANTS WHERE RATHER THAN DELIVERING A COUPLE OF PROBIOTIC MICROBES THROUGH THE MOUTH
JonathanEisen_2012P@644.01:650.24 THEY ARE DELIVERING A COMMUNITY OF PROBIOTICS A COMMUNITY OF MICROBES FROM A HEALTHY DONOR
JonathanEisen_2012P@650.24:663.85 THROUGH THE OTHER END AND THIS HAS TURNED OUT TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN FIGHTING CERTAIN INTRANSIGENT INFECTIOUS DISEASES LIKE CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE INFECTIONS THAT CAN STAY WITH PEOPLE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS
JonathanEisen_2012P@663.85:674.64 TRANSPLANTS OF THE FECES OF THE MICROBES FROM THE FECES FROM A HEALTHY DONOR HAS ACTUALLY BEEN SHOWN TO CURE SYSTEMIC C DIF INFECTIONS IN SOME PEOPLE
JonathanEisen_2012P@674.64:688.57 NOW WHAT THESE TRANSPLANTS THESE FECAL TRANSPLANTS OR THE POO TEA SUGGEST TO ME AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE COME UP WITH THIS SAME IDEA IS THAT THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY IN AND ON US
JonathanEisen_2012P@688.57:699.24 IT 'S AN ORGAN WE SHOULD VIEW IT AS A FUNCTIONING ORGAN PART OF OURSELVES WE SHOULD TREAT IT CAREFULLY AND WITH RESPECT
JonathanEisen_2012P@699.24:708.06 AND WE DO NOT WANT TO MESS WITH IT SAY BY C SECTIONS OR BY ANTIBIOTICS OR EXCESSIVE CLEANLINESS
JonathanEisen_2012P@708.06:719.52 WITHOUT SOME REAL GOOD JUSTIFICATION AND WHAT THE DNA SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO DO NOW IS DO DETAILED STUDIES OF SAY ONE HUNDRED
JonathanEisen_2012P@719.52:730.72 PATIENTS WHO HAVE CROHN 'S DISEASE AND ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO DON 'T HAVE CROHN 'S DISEASE OR ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO TOOK ANTIBIOTICS WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE AND ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO DID NOT TAKE ANTIBIOTICS
JonathanEisen_2012P@730.72:744.12 AND WE CAN NOW START TO COMPARE THE COMMUNITY OF MICROBES AND THEIR GENES AND SEE IF THERE ARE DIFFERENCES AND EVENTUALLY WE MAY BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IF THEY 'RE NOT JUST CORRELATIVE DIFFERENCES BUT CAUSATIVE
JonathanEisen_2012P@744.12:757.41 STUDIES IN MODEL SYSTEMS LIKE MOUSE AND OTHER ANIMALS ARE ALSO HELPING DO THIS BUT PEOPLE ARE NOW USING THESE TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE THEY 'VE GOTTEN VERY CHEAP TO STUDY THE MICROBES IN AND ON A VARIETY OF PEOPLE
JonathanEisen_2012P@757.41:773.57 SO IN WRAPPING UP WHAT I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT IS I DIDN 'T TELL YOU A PART OF THE STORY OF COMING DOWN WITH DIABETES IT TURNS OUT THAT MY FATHER WAS AN M D ACTUALLY STUDIED HORMONES I TOLD HIM MANY TIMES THAT I WAS TIRED
JonathanEisen_2012P@791.51:795.23 AND I WAS GETTING UP EVERY FIVE MINUTES TO PEE
JonathanEisen_2012P@795.8:798.93 AND DRINKING EVERYBODY 'S WATER AT THE TABLE
JonathanEisen_2012P@799.24:802.43 AND I THINK THEY ALL THOUGHT I WAS A DRUGGIE
JonathanEisen_2012P@805.38:808.77 THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY MY FATHER AS AN EXAMPLE
JonathanEisen_2012P@808.82:820.56 SOMETIMES DOESN 'T SEE WHAT 'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR EYES THE MICROBIAL CLOUD IT IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US WE CAN 'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME IT 'S INVISIBLE THEY 'RE MICROBES THEY 'RE TINY
JonathanEisen_2012P@828.23:846.52 IS TO START THINKING ABOUT THIS MICROBIAL COMMUNITY IN THE CONTEXT OF EVERYTHING IN HUMAN MEDICINE IT DOESN 'T MEAN THAT IT AFFECTS EVERY PART OF US BUT IT MIGHT WHAT WE NEED IS A FULL FIELD GUIDE TO THE MICROBES THAT LIVE IN AND ON PEOPLE SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND
JonathanEisen_2012P@846.52:851.05 WHAT THEY 'RE DOING TO OUR LIVES WE ARE THEM
JonathanEisen_2012P@851.18:853.56 THEY ARE US THANK YOU
