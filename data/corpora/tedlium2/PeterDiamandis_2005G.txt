PeterDiamandis_2005G@25.26:33.92 TAKE THE PEOPLE OF EARTH AND TRANSITION OFF PERMANENTLY AND THAT'S EXCITING IN FACT I THINK IT IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE THAT WE OPEN THE SPACE FRONTIER
PeterDiamandis_2005G@42.86:53.75 IF YOU THINK ABOUT SPACE EVERYTHING WE HOLD OF VALUE ON THIS PLANET METALS AND MINERALS AND REAL ESTATE AND ENERGY IS IN INFINITE QUANTITIES IN SPACE IN FACT THE EARTH IS A
PeterDiamandis_2005G@54.17:62.93 IN A SUPERMARKET FILLED WITH RESOURCES THE ANALOGY FOR ME IS ALASKA YOU KNOW WE BOUGHT ALASKA WE AMERICANS BOUGHT ALASKA IN THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES IT'S CALLED SEWARD 'S
PeterDiamandis_2005G@63.83:72.16 WE VALUED IT AS THE NUMBER OF SEAL PELTS WE COULD KILL AND THEN WE DISCOVERED THESE THINGS GOLD AND OIL AND FISHING AND TIMBER AND IT BECAME
PeterDiamandis_2005G@72.67:82.07 KNOW A TRILLION DOLLAR ECONOMY AND NOW WE TAKE OUR HONEYMOONS THERE THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN IN SPACE WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF THE GREATEST EXPLORATION THAT THE HUMAN RACE HAS EVER KNOWN
PeterDiamandis_2005G@93.39:102.15 IN FACT I THINK IN THE NEXT DECADE WITHOUT ANY QUESTION WE WILL DISCOVER LIFE ON MARS AND FIND THAT IT IS LITERALLY UBIQUITOUS UNDER THE SOILS AND DIFFERENT PARTS OF THAT PLANET
PeterDiamandis_2005G@102.79:110.89 THE STRONGER MOTIVATOR THE MUCH STRONGER MOTIVATOR IS FEAR IT DROVE US TO THE MOON WE LITERALLY IN FEAR WITH THE SOVIET UNION RACED TO THE MOON
PeterDiamandis_2005G@111.59:125.22 AND WE HAVE THESE HUGE ROCKS YOU KNOW KILLER SIZED ROCKS IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OR MILLIONS OUT THERE AND WHILE THE PROBABILITY IS VERY SMALL THE IMPACT FIGURED IN LITERALLY OF ONE OF THESE HITTING THE EARTH IS SO HUGE
PeterDiamandis_2005G@125.56:135.97 THAT TO SPEND A SMALL FRACTION LOOKING SEARCHING PREPARING TO DEFEND IS NOT UNREASONABLE AND OF COURSE THE THIRD MOTIVATOR ONE NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART AS AN ENTREPRENEUR IS WEALTH
PeterDiamandis_2005G@163.45:171.29 THIS WAS MY MOTIVATION WAS ACTUALLY DURING APOLLO AND APOLLO WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST MOTIVATORS EVER IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
PeterDiamandis_2005G@179.30:192.62 AND PEOPLE LEFT THEIR JOBS AND THEY WENT TO OBSCURE LOCATIONS TO GO AND BE PART OF THIS AMAZING MISSION AND WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT GOING TO SPACE WE WENT FROM HAVING LITERALLY PUT ALAN SHEPARD IN SUB ORBITAL FLIGHT TO GOING TO THE MOON IN EIGHT YEARS
PeterDiamandis_2005G@192.85:202.95 AND THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE PEOPLE THAT GOT US THERE WAS TWENTY SIX YEARS OLD THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT COULDN'T BE DONE THEY HAD TO MAKE UP EVERYTHING AND THAT
PeterDiamandis_2005G@203.04:213.41 MY FRIEND IS AMAZING MOTIVATION THIS IS A THIS IS GENE CERNAN A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE SAYING IF I CAN GO TO THE MOON THIS IS THE LAST HUMAN ON THE MOON SO FAR NOTHING NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE
PeterDiamandis_2005G@214.01:221.91 BUT OF COURSE WE'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS AS THE PERSON TAKING US THERE BUT I PUT FORWARD HERE THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING TO GET US THERE
PeterDiamandis_2005G@222.13:234.53 THE GOVERNMENT IS UNABLE TO TAKE THE RISKS REQUIRED TO OPEN UP THIS PRECIOUS FRONTIER THE SHUTTLE IS COSTING A BILLION DOLLARS A LAUNCH THAT'S A PATHETIC NUMBER IT'S UNREASONABLE WE SHOULDN 'T BE HAPPY IN STANDING FOR THAT
PeterDiamandis_2005G@235.13:244.15 THE THINGS THAT WE DID WITH THE ANSARI X PRIZE WAS TAKE THE CHALLENGE ON THAT RISK IS OK YOU KNOW AS WE ARE GOING OUT THERE AND TAKING ON A NEW FRONTIER
PeterDiamandis_2005G@244.31:252.89 WE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO RISK IN FACT ANYONE WHO SAYS WE SHOULDN 'T YOU KNOW JUST NEEDS TO BE PUT ASIDE BECAUSE AS WE GO FORWARD
PeterDiamandis_2005G@253.96:263.77 IN FACT THE GREATEST DISCOVERIES WE WILL EVER KNOW IS AHEAD OF US THE ENTREPRENEURS IN THE SPACE BUSINESS ARE THE FURRY MAMMALS AND CLEARLY THE INDUSTRIAL MILITARY COMPLEX WITH BOEING AND LOCKHEED
PeterDiamandis_2005G@264.14:274.52 AND NASA ARE THE DINOSAURS THE ABILITY FOR US TO ACCESS THESE RESOURCES TO GAIN PLANETARY REDUNDANCY WE CAN NOW GATHER ALL THE INFORMATION THE GENETIC CODES
PeterDiamandis_2005G@274.85:284.41 YOU KNOW EVERYTHING STORED ON OUR DATABASES AND BACK THEM UP OFF THE PLANET IN CASE THERE WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE DISASTROUS SITUATIONS THE DIFFICULTY IS GETTING THERE
PeterDiamandis_2005G@285.36:295.81 AND CLEARLY THE COST TO ORBIT IS KEY ONCE YOU'RE IN ORBIT YOU ARE TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY ENERGETICALLY TO ANYWHERE THE MOON TO MARS AND TODAY THERE'S ONLY THREE VEHICLES THE U S SHUTTLE
PeterDiamandis_2005G@296.20:303.31 THE RUSSIAN SOYUZ AND THE CHINESE VEHICLE THAT GETS YOU THERE ARGUABLY IT'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A PERSON ON THE
PeterDiamandis_2005G@304.77:318.34 ONE OF THE COMPANIES I STARTED SPACE ADVENTURES WILL SELL YOU A TICKET WE'VE DONE TWO SO FAR WE'LL BE ANNOUNCING TWO MORE ON THE SOYUZ TO GO UP TO THE SPACE STATION FOR TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS BUT THAT'S EXPENSIVE AND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE POTENTIAL IS
PeterDiamandis_2005G@330.77:337.92 AND THE TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBLE THAT WILL ALLOW US TO REALLY DRIVE SPACE EXPLORATION BUT HOW CHEAP COULD IT GET
PeterDiamandis_2005G@339.45:348.99 GIVE YOU THE END POINT WE KNOW TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TODAY YOU CAN GO AND BUY A TICKET BUT HOW CHEAP COULD IT GET LET 'S GO BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS HERE IF YOU CALCULATE THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL ENERGY MGH
PeterDiamandis_2005G@349.28:357.91 TO TAKE YOU AND YOUR SPACE SUIT UP TO A COUPLE HUNDRED MILES AND THEN YOU ACCELERATE YOURSELF TO SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MILES PER HOUR REMEMBER THAT ONE HALF MV SQUARED
PeterDiamandis_2005G@364.01:369.30 ENERGY IF YOU EXPENDED THAT OVER AN HOUR IT'S ABOUT ONE POINT SIX MEGAWATTS
PeterDiamandis_2005G@380.42:380.80 HUNDRED
PeterDiamandis_2005G@382.73:387.76 THAT'S THE PRICE IMPROVEMENT CURVE THAT WE NEED SOME BREAKTHROUGHS IN PHYSICS ALONG THE WAY I'LL GRANT YOU THAT
PeterDiamandis_2005G@389.96:398.73 BUT GUYS IF THE IF HISTORY HAS TAUGHT US ANYTHING IT'S THAT IF YOU CAN IMAGINE IT YOU WILL GET THERE EVENTUALLY I HAVE NO QUESTION
PeterDiamandis_2005G@399.01:406.73 THAT THE PHYSICS THE ENGINEERING TO GET US DOWN TO THE POINT WHERE ALL OF US CAN AFFORD ORBITAL SPACE FLIGHT IS AROUND THE CORNER
PeterDiamandis_2005G@407.13:417.86 THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A REAL MARKETPLACE TO DRIVE THE INVESTMENT TODAY THE BOEINGS AND THE LOCKHEEDS DON'T SPEND A DOLLAR OF THEIR OWN MONEY IN R D
PeterDiamandis_2005G@418.20:428.99 IT'S ALL GOVERNMENT RESEARCH DOLLARS AND VERY FEW OF THOSE AND IN FACT THE LARGE CORPORATIONS THE GOVERNMENTS CAN'T TAKE THE RISK SO WE NEED WHAT I CALL AN EXOTHERMIC ECONOMIC REACTION IN SPACE
PeterDiamandis_2005G@429.83:440.27 TODAY 'S COMMERCIAL MARKETS WORLDWIDE GLOBAL COMMERCIAL LAUNCH MARKET TWELVE TO FIFTEEN LAUNCHES PER YEAR NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL COMPANIES OUT THERE TWELVE TO FIFTEEN COMPANIES ONE PER COMPANY
PeterDiamandis_2005G@448.38:456.04 IT'S PEOPLE THE ANSARI X PRIZE WAS MY SOLUTION READING ABOUT LINDBERGH FOR CREATING THE VEHICLES TO GET US THERE
PeterDiamandis_2005G@456.36:466.92 WE OFFERED TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH FOR THE FIRST REUSABLE SHIP CARRY THREE PEOPLE UP TO ONE HUNDRED KILOMETERS COME BACK DOWN AND WITHIN TWO WEEKS MAKE THE TRIP AGAIN TWENTY SIX TEAMS FROM SEVEN COUNTRIES
PeterDiamandis_2005G@467.46:478.62 ENTERED THE COMPETITION SPENDING BETWEEN ONE TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS EACH AND OF COURSE WE HAD A BEAUTIFUL SPACESHIPONE WHICH MADE THOSE TWO FLIGHTS AND WON THE COMPETITION AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU THERE
PeterDiamandis_2005G@479.09:481.69 TO THAT MORNING FOR JUST A QUICK VIDEO
PeterDiamandis_2005G@534.68:542.48 SO IN MY OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS THE CHIEF JUDGE OF THE ANSARI X PRIZE COMPETITION I DECLARE THAT MOJAVE AEROSPACE VENTURES HAS INDEED
PeterDiamandis_2005G@561.23:573.29 I FOUND A VISIONARY FAMILY THE ANSARI FAMILY AND CHAMP CAR AND RAISED PART OF THE MONEY BUT NOT THE FULL TEN MILLION AND WHAT I ENDED UP DOING WAS GOING OUT TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND BUYING A HOLE IN ONE INSURANCE POLICY
PeterDiamandis_2005G@591.20:593.10 THE BEST THING IS THEY PAID OFF
PeterDiamandis_2005G@596.98:604.29 WE'VE HAD A LOT OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND IT'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS ONE OF THE THINGS I'M MOST HAPPY ABOUT IS THAT
PeterDiamandis_2005G@604.72:610.89 THE SPACESHIPONE IS GOING TO HANG IN AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM NEXT TO THE SPIRIT OF ST LOUIS AND THE WRIGHT FLYER
PeterDiamandis_2005G@615.03:626.63 SO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FUTURE STEPS TO SPACE WHAT'S AVAILABLE FOR YOU TODAY YOU CAN GO AND EXPERIENCE WEIGHTLESS FLIGHTS BY EIGHT SUBORBITAL FLIGHTS THE PRICE TAG FOR THAT
PeterDiamandis_2005G@650.88:663.52 QUICK MOMENT FOR THE DESIGNERS IN THE AUDIENCE WE SPENT ELEVEN YEARS GETTING FAA APPROVAL TO DO ZERO GRAVITY FLIGHTS HERE ARE SOME FUN IMAGES HERE 'S BURT RUTAN AND MY GOOD FRIEND GREG MERONEK INSIDE A ZERO GRAVITY
PeterDiamandis_2005G@677.54:679.41 FOR A CHANCE TO WIN THE FIRST
PeterDiamandis_2005G@697.77:707.04 THE FUTURE OF PRIZES YOU KNOW PRIZES ARE A VERY OLD IDEA I HAD THE PLEASURE OF BORROWING FROM THE LONGITUDE PRIZE AND THE ORTEIG PRIZE THAT PUT LINDBERGH FORWARD
PeterDiamandis_2005G@707.45:716.52 AND WE HAVE MADE A DECISION IN THE X PRIZE FOUNDATION TO ACTUALLY CARRY THAT CONCEPT FORWARD INTO OTHER TECHNOLOGY AREAS AND WE JUST TOOK ON A NEW MISSION STATEMENT
PeterDiamandis_2005G@725.16:737.58 I SHOWED THIS SLIDE TO LARRY PAGE WHO JUST JOINED OUR BOARD AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GIVE TO A NONPROFIT YOU MIGHT HAVE FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR IF YOU HAVE A MATCHING GRANT IT'S TYPICALLY TWO OR THREE TO ONE IF YOU PUT UP A PRIZE
PeterDiamandis_2005G@738.02:747.08 YOU CAN GET LITERALLY A FIFTY TO ONE LEVERAGE ON YOUR DOLLARS AND THAT'S HUGE AND THEN HE TURNED AROUND AND SAID WELL IF YOU BACK A PRIZE INSTITUTE THAT RUNS A TEN PRIZE YOU GET FIVE HUNDRED TO ONE I SAID
PeterDiamandis_2005G@747.80:753.49 THAT'S GREAT SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY ARE LOOKING TO TURN THE X PRIZE INTO A WORLD CLASS PRIZE INSTITUTE
PeterDiamandis_2005G@754.91:761.87 THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PUT UP A PRIZE WHEN YOU ANNOUNCE IT AND TEAMS START TO BEGIN DOING TRIALS YOU GET
PeterDiamandis_2005G@770.45:778.24 THEN WHEN THE PRIZE IS ACTUALLY WON AFTER IT'S MOVING YOU GET SOCIETAL BENEFITS YOU KNOW NEW TECHNOLOGY NEW CAPABILITY
PeterDiamandis_2005G@778.60:785.24 AND THE BENEFITS TO THE SPONSORS IS THE SUM OF THE PUBLICITY AND SOCIETAL BENEFITS OVER THE LONG TERM THAT'S OUR VALUE PROPOSITION IN A
PeterDiamandis_2005G@786.52:797.76 IF YOU WERE GOING TO GO AND TRY TO CREATE SPACESHIPONE OR ANY KIND OF A NEW TECHNOLOGY YOU HAVE TO FUND THAT FROM THE BEGINNING AND MAINTAIN THAT FUNDING WITH AN UNCERTAIN OUTCOME IT MAY OR MAY NOT HAPPEN
PeterDiamandis_2005G@798.17:807.47 BUT IF YOU PUT UP A PRIZE THE BEAUTIFUL THING IS YOU KNOW IT'S A VERY SMALL MAINTENANCE FEE AND YOU PAY ON SUCCESS ORTEIG DIDN'T PAY A DIME OUT TO THE NINE TEAMS THAT WENT ACROSS
PeterDiamandis_2005G@815.79:820.49 YOU KNOW THAT WHEN YOU'RE GOING FOR A GOAL THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN DO IT YOURSELF
PeterDiamandis_2005G@821.09:830.96 THEN YOU'VE GOT TO YOU KNOW FACE POTENTIAL PUBLIC RIDICULE OF THAT'S A CRAZY IDEA IT'LL NEVER WORK AND THEN YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE OTHERS SO THAT THEY CAN IN FACT HELP YOU RAISE THE FUNDS
PeterDiamandis_2005G@844.89:853.09 OR SUPPORT ALL OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE A PRIZE CREDENTIALS THE IDEA THAT THIS IS A GOOD IDEA WELL IT MUST BE A GOOD IDEA SOMEONE 'S OFFERING TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO GO AND DO THIS THING
PeterDiamandis_2005G@853.60:861.04 AND EACH OF THESE AREAS WAS SOMETHING THAT WE FOUND THE ANSARI X PRIZE HELPED SHORT CIRCUIT THESE FOR INNOVATION
PeterDiamandis_2005G@861.43:875.34 SO AS AN ORGANIZATION WE PUT TOGETHER A PRIZE DISCOVERY PROCESS OF HOW TO COME UP WITH PRIZES AND WRITE THE RULES AND WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT CREATING PRIZES IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES WE'RE LOOKING AT ATTACKING ENERGY ENVIRONMENT NANOTECHNOLOGY
PeterDiamandis_2005G@877.65:877.94 TALK ABOUT
PeterDiamandis_2005G@907.79:918.80 SO MY FINAL SLIDE HERE IS THE MOST CRITICAL TOOL FOR SOLVING HUMANITY 'S GRAND CHALLENGES IT ISN'T TECHNOLOGY IT ISN'T MONEY IT'S ONLY ONE THING IT'S THE COMMITTED PASSIONATE HUMAN MIND
