BeauLotto_2012G@13.61:15.4 SO THIS GAME IS VERY SIMPLE
BeauLotto_2012G@15.62:20.43 ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS READ WHAT YOU SEE RIGHT SO
BeauLotto_2012G@35.9:40.51 WERE PORTUGUESE RIGHT HOW ABOUT THIS ONE ONE TWO THREE
BeauLotto_2012G@80.59:85.3 IT 'S GETTING INFORMATION IT 'S GENERATING BEHAVIOR THAT 'S USEFUL
BeauLotto_2012G@117.01:123.29 FALLING IN LOVE EVERYTHING BEGINS WITH PERCEPTION NOW IF PERCEPTION IS GROUNDED IN OUR HISTORY
BeauLotto_2012G@134.73:143.62 I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT SEEING DIFFERENTLY AND ALL NEW PERCEPTIONS BEGIN IN THE SAME WAY THEY BEGIN WITH A QUESTION
BeauLotto_2012G@143.62:153.75 THE PROBLEM WITH QUESTIONS IS THEY CREATE UNCERTAINTY NOW UNCERTAINTY IS A VERY BAD THING IT 'S EVOLUTIONARILY A BAD THING IF YOU 'RE NOT SURE THAT 'S A PREDATOR IT 'S TOO LATE
BeauLotto_2012G@169.6:186.57 THE QUESTION WHY IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS THINGS YOU CAN DO BECAUSE IT TAKES YOU INTO UNCERTAINTY AND YET THE IRONY IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN EVER DO ANYTHING NEW IS TO STEP INTO THAT SPACE SO HOW CAN WE EVER DO ANYTHING NEW WELL FORTUNATELY
BeauLotto_2012G@186.57:189.56 EVOLUTION HAS GIVEN US AN ANSWER RIGHT
BeauLotto_2012G@209.99:216.47 SO WHAT IS EVOLUTION 'S ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM OF UNCERTAINTY IT 'S PLAY
BeauLotto_2012G@216.47:230.69 NOW PLAY IS NOT SIMPLY A PROCESS EXPERTS IN PLAY WILL TELL YOU THAT ACTUALLY IT 'S A WAY OF BEING PLAY IS ONE OF THE ONLY HUMAN ENDEAVORS WHERE UNCERTAINTY IS ACTUALLY CELEBRATED UNCERTAINTY IS WHAT MAKES PLAY FUN
BeauLotto_2012G@230.77:245.74 RIGHT IT 'S ADAPTABLE TO CHANGE RIGHT IT OPENS POSSIBILITY AND IT 'S COOPERATIVE IT 'S ACTUALLY HOW WE DO OUR SOCIAL BONDING AND IT 'S INTRINSICALLY MOTIVATED WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WE PLAY TO PLAY PLAY IS ITS OWN REWARD
BeauLotto_2012G@245.74:264.37 NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THESE FIVE WAYS OF BEING THESE ARE THE EXACT SAME WAYS OF BEING YOU NEED IN ORDER TO BE A GOOD SCIENTIST SCIENCE IS NOT DEFINED BY THE METHOD SECTION OF A PAPER IT 'S ACTUALLY A WAY OF BEING WHICH IS HERE AND THIS IS TRUE FOR ANYTHING THAT IS CREATIVE SO
BeauLotto_2012G@264.46:277.15 IF YOU ADD RULES TO PLAY YOU HAVE A GAME THAT 'S ACTUALLY WHAT AN EXPERIMENT IS SO ARMED WITH THESE TWO IDEAS THAT SCIENCE IS A WAY OF BEING AND EXPERIMENTS ARE PLAY WE ASKED
BeauLotto_2012G@277.16:294.6 CAN ANYONE BECOME A SCIENTIST AND WHO BETTER TO ASK THAN TWENTY FIVE EIGHT TO TEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY 'RE EXPERTS IN PLAY SO I TOOK MY BEE ARENA DOWN TO A SMALL SCHOOL IN DEVON AND THE AIM OF THIS WAS TO NOT JUST GET THE KIDS TO SEE SCIENCE DIFFERENTLY
BeauLotto_2012G@294.6:298.35 BUT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF SCIENCE TO SEE THEMSELVES DIFFERENTLY
BeauLotto_2012G@302.6:317.59 NOW I SHOULD SAY THAT WE DIDN 'T GET FUNDING FOR THIS STUDY BECAUSE THE SCIENTISTS SAID SMALL CHILDREN COULDN 'T MAKE A USEFUL CONTRIBUTION TO SCIENCE AND THE TEACHERS SAID KIDS COULDN 'T DO IT SO WE DID IT ANYWAY RIGHT OF COURSE SO
BeauLotto_2012G@317.67:333.34 HERE ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I PUT THEM IN SMALL PRINT SO YOU WOULDN 'T BOTHER READING IT POINT IS THAT FIVE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE KIDS CAME UP WITH WERE ACTUALLY THE BASIS OF SCIENCE PUBLICATION THE LAST FIVE TO FIFTEEN YEARS RIGHT SO THEY WERE ASKING QUESTIONS THAT WERE SIGNIFICANT TO EXPERT SCIENTISTS
BeauLotto_2012G@333.34:343.45 NOW HERE I WANT TO SHARE THE STAGE WITH SOMEONE QUITE SPECIAL RIGHT SHE WAS ONE OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THIS STUDY AND SHE 'S NOW ONE OF THE YOUNGEST PUBLISHED SCIENTISTS IN THE WORLD
BeauLotto_2012G@343.84:360.59 RIGHT SHE WILL NOW ONCE SHE COMES ONTO STAGE WILL BE THE YOUNGEST PERSON TO EVER SPEAK AT TED RIGHT NOW SCIENCE AND ASKING QUESTIONS IS ABOUT COURAGE NOW SHE IS THE PERSONIFICATION OF COURAGE BECAUSE SHE 'S GOING TO STAND UP HERE AND TALK TO YOU ALL SO AMY WOULD YOU PLEASE COME UP
BeauLotto_2012G@487.26:500.6 AND THAT WAS REALLY HARD FOR THE TEACHERS IT 'S EASY FOR A SCIENTIST TO GO IN AND NOT HAVE A CLUE WHAT HE 'S DOING BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT WE DO IN THE LAB BUT FOR A TEACHER NOT TO KNOW WHAT 'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT THE END OF THE DAY SO MUCH OF THE CREDIT GOES TO DAVE STRUDWICK WHO WAS THE COLLABORATOR ON THIS PROJECT
BeauLotto_2012G@554.84:567.93 THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS MINE OKAY LAUGHTER NOW I TELL THEM A PAPER HAS FOUR DIFFERENT SECTIONS AN INTRODUCTION A METHODS A RESULTS A DISCUSSION THE INTRODUCTION SAYS WHAT 'S THE QUESTION AND WHY METHODS WHAT DID YOU DO RESULTS WHAT WAS THE OBSERVATION
BeauLotto_2012G@592.72:602.46 THE RESULTS SECTION IT SAYS TRAINING PHASE THE PUZZLE DUH DUH DUUUUUHHH RIGHT LAUGHTER AND THE METHODS IT SAYS THEN WE PUT THE BEES INTO THE FRIDGE AND MADE BEE PIE SMILEY FACE
BeauLotto_2012G@606.9:612.22 SO HERE 'S THE TITLE PAGE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF AUTHORS THERE ALL THE ONES IN BOLD ARE EIGHT TO TEN YEARS OLD
BeauLotto_2012G@617.67:635.73 AND NOT ONE INDIVIDUAL SO WE SUBMIT IT TO A PUBLIC ACCESS JOURNAL AND IT SAYS THIS IT SAID MANY THINGS BUT IT SAID THIS I 'M AFRAID THE PAPER FAILS OUR INITIAL QUALITY CONTROL CHECKS IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS LAUGHTER IN OTHER WORDS IT STARTS OFF ONCE UPON A TIME THE FIGURES ARE IN CRAYON ETC LAUGHTER SO WE SAID WE 'LL GET IT REVIEWED
BeauLotto_2012G@635.73:649.69 SO I SENT IT TO DALE PURVES WHO IS AT THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE ONE OF THE LEADING NEUROSCIENTISTS IN THE WORLD AND HE SAYS THIS IS THE MOST ORIGINAL SCIENCE PAPER I HAVE EVER READ LAUGHTER AND IT CERTAINLY DESERVES WIDE EXPOSURE LARRY MALONEY EXPERT IN VISION SAYS
BeauLotto_2012G@649.69:653.97 THE PAPER IS MAGNIFICENT THE WORK WOULD BE PUBLISHABLE IF DONE BY ADULTS
BeauLotto_2012G@653.97:673.59 SO WHAT DID WE DO WE SEND IT BACK TO THE EDITOR THEY SAY NO SO WE ASKED LARRY AND NATALIE HEMPEL TO WRITE A COMMENTARY SITUATING THE FINDINGS FOR SCIENTISTS RIGHT PUTTING IN THE REFERENCES AND WE SUBMIT IT TO BIOLOGY LETTERS AND THERE IT WAS REVIEWED BY FIVE INDEPENDENT REFEREES AND IT WAS PUBLISHED
BeauLotto_2012G@689:704.77 SCIENCE ACTUALLY RIGHT SO THIS MAKES AMY AND HER FRIENDS THE YOUNGEST PUBLISHED SCIENTISTS IN THE WORLD WHAT WAS THE FEEDBACK LIKE WELL IT WAS PUBLISHED TWO DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS DOWNLOADED THIRTY THOUSAND TIMES IN THE FIRST DAY RIGHT
BeauLotto_2012G@704.77:719.38 IT WAS THE EDITORS CHOICE IN SCIENCE WHICH IS A TOP SCIENCE MAGAZINE IT 'S FOREVER FREELY ACCESSIBLE BY BIOLOGY LETTERS IT 'S THE ONLY PAPER THAT WILL EVER BE FREELY ACCESSIBLE BY THIS JOURNAL LAST YEAR IT WAS THE SECOND MOST DOWNLOADED PAPER BY BIOLOGY LETTERS
BeauLotto_2012G@719.38:726.05 AND THE FEEDBACK FROM NOT JUST SCIENTISTS AND TEACHERS BUT THE PUBLIC AS WELL AND I 'LL JUST READ ONE
BeauLotto_2012G@741.91:750.29 CHILDREN 'S TEAM FROM MY SIDE SO I 'D LIKE TO CONCLUDE WITH A PHYSICAL METAPHOR CAN I DO IT ON YOU
BeauLotto_2012G@754.3:763.15 SCIENCE IS ABOUT TAKING RISKS SO THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE RISK RIGHT LAUGHTER FOR ME NOT FOR HIM RIGHT BECAUSE WE 'VE ONLY DONE THIS ONCE BEFORE
BeauLotto_2012G@765.14:766.78 AND YOU LIKE TECHNOLOGY RIGHT
BeauLotto_2012G@796.93:800.35 OKAY HOW ABOUT IF EVERYONE OVER THERE SHOUTS ONE TWO THREE
BeauLotto_2012G@845.1:860.67 THROUGH THE PROCESS OF PLAY RIGHT NOW TRUE SCIENCE EDUCATION I THINK SHOULD BE ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE A VOICE AND ENABLING TO EXPRESS THAT VOICE SO I 'VE ASKED AMY TO BE THE LAST VOICE IN THIS SHORT STORY SO AMY
