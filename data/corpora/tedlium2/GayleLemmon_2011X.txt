GayleLemmon_2011X INVEST IN VICTIMS
GayleLemmon_2011X WE INVEST IN SURVIVORS AND IN WAYS BOTH BIG AND SMALL THE NARRATIVE OF THE VICTIM SHAPES
GayleLemmon_2011X AND WE DON 'T INVEST IN WHAT 'S INVISIBLE TO US BUT THIS IS THE FACE
GayleLemmon_2011X OF RESILIENCE
GayleLemmon_2011X AND THAT TURNED OUT TO BE WOMEN
GayleLemmon_2011X I HAD LEFT ABC NEWS AND A CAREER I LOVED AT THE AGE OF THIRTY FOR BUSINESS SCHOOL A PATH I KNEW ALMOST NOTHING ABOUT NONE OF THE WOMEN I HAD GROWN UP WITH IN MARYLAND HAD GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE LET ALONE CONSIDERED BUSINESS SCHOOL BUT THEY HAD HUSTLED TO FEED THEIR KIDS AND PAY THEIR RENT
GayleLemmon_2011X AND I SAW FROM A YOUNG AGE THAT HAVING A DECENT JOB AND EARNING A GOOD LIVING MADE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE FOR FAMILIES WHO WERE STRUGGLING
GayleLemmon_2011X SO IF YOU 'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT JOBS THEN YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT ENTREPRENEURS AND IF YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT ENTREPRENEURS IN CONFLICT AND POST CONFLICT SETTINGS THEN YOU MUST TALK ABOUT WOMEN BECAUSE THEY ARE THE POPULATION YOU HAVE LEFT
GayleLemmon_2011X RWANDA IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE GENOCIDE WAS SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT FEMALE
GayleLemmon_2011X I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO SOME OF THOSE ENTREPRENEURS I 'VE MET AND SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF WHAT THEY 'VE TAUGHT ME OVER THE YEARS
GayleLemmon_2011X I WENT TO AFGHANISTAN IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE TO WORK ON A FINANCIAL TIMES PIECE AND THERE I MET KAMILA A YOUNG WOMEN WHO TOLD ME SHE HAD JUST TURNED DOWN A JOB WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT WOULD HAVE PAID HER NEARLY DOLLAR TWO THOUSAND A MONTH
GayleLemmon_2011X AN ASTRONOMICAL SUM IN THAT CONTEXT AND SHE HAD TURNED IT DOWN SHE SAID BECAUSE SHE WAS GOING TO START HER NEXT BUSINESS AN ENTREPRENEURSHIP CONSULTANCY THAT WOULD TEACH BUSINESS SKILLS TO MEN AND WOMEN ALL AROUND AFGHANISTAN
GayleLemmon_2011X BUSINESS SHE SAID WAS CRITICAL TO HER COUNTRY 'S FUTURE BECAUSE LONG AFTER THIS ROUND OF INTERNATIONALS LEFT BUSINESS WOULD HELP
GayleLemmon_2011X KEEP HER COUNTRY PEACEFUL AND SECURE
GayleLemmon_2011X AND SHE SAID BUSINESS WAS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN
GayleLemmon_2011X BECAUSE EARNING AN INCOME EARNED RESPECT AND MONEY WAS POWER FOR WOMEN
GayleLemmon_2011X THIS IS ACTUALLY MY THIRD BUSINESS MY FIRST BUSINESS WAS A DRESSMAKING BUSINESS I STARTED UNDER THE TALIBAN AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY AN EXCELLENT BUSINESS BECAUSE WE PROVIDED JOBS FOR WOMEN ALL AROUND OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND THAT 'S REALLY HOW I BECAME AN ENTREPRENEUR
GayleLemmon_2011X THINK ABOUT THIS HERE WERE GIRLS WHO BRAVED DANGER TO BECOME BREADWINNERS DURING YEARS IN WHICH THEY COULDN 'T EVEN BE ON THEIR STREETS
GayleLemmon_2011X AND AT A TIME OF ECONOMIC COLLAPSE WHEN PEOPLE SOLD BABY DOLLS AND SHOE LACES AND WINDOWS AND DOORS JUST TO SURVIVE
GayleLemmon_2011X THESE GIRLS MADE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SURVIVAL AND STARVATION FOR SO MANY
GayleLemmon_2011X I COULDN 'T LEAVE THE STORY AND I COULDN 'T LEAVE THE TOPIC EITHER BECAUSE EVERYWHERE I WENT I MET MORE OF THESE WOMEN WHO NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW ABOUT
GayleLemmon_2011X OR EVEN WISH TO
GayleLemmon_2011X SHE HAD STARTED HER BUSINESS SQUATTING IN AN ABANDONED GARAGE SEWING SHEETS AND PILLOW CASES SHE WOULD TAKE TO MARKETS ALL AROUND THE CITY SO THAT SHE COULD SUPPORT THE TWELVE OR THIRTEEN FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WERE COUNTING ON HER FOR SURVIVAL
GayleLemmon_2011X BY THE TIME WE MET SHE HAD TWENTY EMPLOYEES MOST OF THEM WOMEN WHO WERE SENDING THEIR BOYS AND THEIR GIRLS TO SCHOOL
GayleLemmon_2011X AND SHE WAS JUST THE START I MET WOMEN RUNNING ESSENTIAL OILS BUSINESSES WINERIES AND EVEN THE COUNTRY 'S LARGEST ADVERTISING AGENCY
GayleLemmon_2011X THINK ABOUT THIS THE IMF OFFICIAL IS HARDLY THE ONLY PERSON TO AUTOMATICALLY FILE WOMEN UNDER MICRO
GayleLemmon_2011X MOST PEOPLE THINK MEN WHY IS THAT
GayleLemmon_2011X BECAUSE WE AIM LOW AND WE THINK SMALL WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN
GayleLemmon_2011X AND EIGHTEEN IN SOUTH KOREA AND INDONESIA WOMEN OWN NEARLY HALF A MILLION FIRMS CHINA WOMEN RUN TWENTY PERCENT OF ALL SMALL BUSINESSES AND IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD OVERALL THAT FIGURE IS FORTY TO FIFTY PERCENT
GayleLemmon_2011X AND AS THE WORLD BANK RECENTLY NOTED WOMEN ARE STUCK IN A PRODUCTIVITY TRAP
GayleLemmon_2011X RECENTLY I WAS AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT IN WASHINGTON AND I MET AN INCREDIBLY PASSIONATE ENTREPRENEUR FROM GHANA
GayleLemmon_2011X SHE SELLS CHOCOLATES AND SHE HAD COME TO WASHINGTON NOT SEEKING A HANDOUT AND NOT SEEKING A MICROLOAN SHE HAD COME SEEKING SERIOUS INVESTMENT DOLLARS SO THAT SHE COULD BUILD THE FACTORY AND BUY THE EQUIPMENT SHE NEEDS TO EXPORT HER CHOCOLATES TO AFRICA EUROPE THE MIDDLE EAST AND FAR BEYOND
GayleLemmon_2011X CAPITAL THAT WOULD HELP HER TO EMPLOY MORE THAN THE TWENTY PEOPLE THAT SHE ALREADY HAS WORKING FOR HER
GayleLemmon_2011X AND CAPITAL THAT WOULD FUEL HER OWN COUNTRY 'S ECONOMIC CLIMB
GayleLemmon_2011X THE GREAT NEWS IS WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT WORKS
GayleLemmon_2011X THEORY AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE HAVE ALREADY TAUGHT US WE DON 'T NEED TO INVENT SOLUTIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE THEM CASH FLOW LOANS BASED IN INCOME RATHER THAN ASSETS LOANS THAT USE SECURE CONTRACTS RATHER THAN COLLATERAL BECAUSE WOMEN OFTEN DON 'T OWN LAND
GayleLemmon_2011X AND KIVA ORG THE MICROLENDER IS ACTUALLY NOW EXPERIMENTING WITH CROWDSOURCING SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED LOANS AND THAT 'S JUST TO START
GayleLemmon_2011X BECAUSE AND I SAY THIS AS SOMEBODY WHO WORKED IN FINANCE
GayleLemmon_2011X FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS AT LEAST HAS GONE INTO THE EMERGING MARKETS IN THE PAST DECADE BECAUSE INVESTORS SAW THE POTENTIAL FOR RETURN AT A TIME OF SLOWING ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SO THEY CREATED FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND FINANCIAL INNOVATION TAILORED TO THE EMERGING MARKETS
GayleLemmon_2011X HOW WONDERFUL WOULD IT BE IF WE WERE PREPARED TO REPLACE ALL OF OUR LOFTY WORDS WITH OUR WALLETS AND INVEST FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS UNLEASHING WOMEN 'S ECONOMIC POTENTIAL
GayleLemmon_2011X JUST THINK OF THE BENEFITS WHEN IT COMES TO JOBS PRODUCTIVITY EMPLOYMENT CHILD NUTRITION MATERNAL MORTALITY LITERACY AND MUCH MUCH MORE
GayleLemmon_2011X BECAUSE AS THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM NOTED SMALLER GENDER GAPS ARE DIRECTLY CORRELATED WITH INCREASED ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS AND NOT ONE COUNTRY IN ALL THE WORLD HAS ELIMINATED ITS ECONOMIC PARTICIPATION GAP
GayleLemmon_2011X SO YOU SEE
GayleLemmon_2011X THIS IS NOT ABOUT DOING GOOD THIS IS ABOUT GLOBAL GROWTH
GayleLemmon_2011X AND GLOBAL EMPLOYMENT
GayleLemmon_2011X IT IS ABOUT HOW WE INVEST AND IT 'S ABOUT HOW WE SEE WOMEN AND WOMEN CAN NO LONGER BE BOTH HALF THE POPULATION
GayleLemmon_2011X AND A SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP
GayleLemmon_2011X OFTENTIMES I GET INTO VERY INTERESTING DISCUSSIONS WITH REPORTERS WHO SAY TO ME GAYLE THESE ARE GREAT STORIES BUT YOU 'RE REALLY WRITING ABOUT THE EXCEPTIONS NOW THAT MAKES ME PAUSE FOR JUST A COUPLE REASONS FIRST OF ALL FOR EXCEPTIONS THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM AND THEY 'RE IMPORTANT SECONDLY
GayleLemmon_2011X AND FINALLY THERE IS NO SOCIETY ANYWHERE IN ALL THE WORLD THAT IS NOT CHANGED EXCEPT BY ITS MOST EXCEPTIONAL SO WHY WOULDN 'T WE CELEBRATE AND ELEVATE THESE CHANGE MAKERS AND JOB CREATORS RATHER THAN OVERLOOK THEM
GayleLemmon_2011X THIS TOPIC OF RESILIENCE IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME AND IN MANY WAYS
GayleLemmon_2011X WE SHOPPED DOUBLE COUPONS AND LAYAWAY AND CONSIGNMENT STORES AND WHEN SHE GOT SICK WITH STAGE FOUR BREAST CANCER AND COULD NO LONGER WORK WE EVEN APPLIED FOR FOOD STAMPS
GayleLemmon_2011X AND WHEN I WOULD FEEL SORRY FOR MYSELF AS NINE OR TEN YEAR OLD GIRLS DO SHE WOULD SAY TO ME MY DEAR ON A SCALE OF MAJOR WORLD TRAGEDIES YOURS IS NOT A THREE
GayleLemmon_2011X AND WHEN I WAS APPLYING TO BUSINESS SCHOOL AND FELT CERTAIN I COULDN 'T DO IT AND NOBODY I KNEW HAD DONE IT I WENT TO MY AUNT WHO SURVIVED YEARS OF BEATINGS AT THE HAND OF HER HUSBAND AND ESCAPED
GayleLemmon_2011X IT IS TIME FOR US TO AIM HIGHER WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN TO INVEST MORE AND TO DEPLOY OUR DOLLARS TO BENEFIT WOMEN ALL AROUND THE WORLD
GayleLemmon_2011X WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE NOT JUST FOR WOMEN BUT FOR A GLOBAL ECONOMY THAT DESPERATELY NEEDS THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TOGETHER
GayleLemmon_2011X WE CAN MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE SO CALLED EXCEPTIONS
GayleLemmon_2011X BEGIN TO RULE WHEN WE CHANGE THE WAY WE SEE OURSELVES OTHERS WILL FOLLOW
