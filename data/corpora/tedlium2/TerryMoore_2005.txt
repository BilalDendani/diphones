TerryMoore_2005@22.07:31.59 SAVVY WORLDLY AND INNOVATIVE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND I THINK THAT 'S TRUE HOWEVER I ALSO HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT MANY IF NOT MOST OF YOU
TerryMoore_2005@31.59:43.6 ARE ACTUALLY TYING YOUR SHOES INCORRECTLY LAUGHTER NOW I KNOW THAT SEEMS LUDICROUS I KNOW THAT SEEMS LUDICROUS AND BELIEVE ME I LIVED THE SAME SAD LIFE UNTIL ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
TerryMoore_2005@43.6:53.23 AND WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WAS I BOUGHT WHAT WAS FOR ME A VERY EXPENSIVE PAIR OF SHOES BUT THOSE SHOES CAME WITH ROUND NYLON LACES AND I COULDN 'T KEEP THEM TIED
TerryMoore_2005@53.23:60.94 SO I WENT BACK TO THE STORE AND SAID TO THE OWNER I LOVE THE SHOES BUT I HATE THE LACES HE TOOK A LOOK AND SAID OH YOU 'RE TYING THEM WRONG
TerryMoore_2005@60.94:68.67 NOW UP UNTIL THAT MOMENT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT BY AGE FIFTY ONE OF THE LIFE SKILLS THAT I HAD REALLY NAILED
TerryMoore_2005@68.67:74.16 WAS TYING MY SHOES BUT NOT SO LET ME DEMONSTRATE

TerryMoore_2005@90.89:103.44 STRONG FORM AND A WEAK FORM OF THIS KNOT AND WE WERE TAUGHT TO TIE THE WEAK FORM AND HERE 'S HOW TO TELL IF YOU PULL THE STRANDS AT THE BASE OF THE KNOT YOU WILL SEE THAT THE BOW WILL ORIENT ITSELF DOWN THE LONG AXIS OF THE SHOE
TerryMoore_2005@103.58:105.69 THAT 'S THE WEAK FORM OF THE KNOT
TerryMoore_2005@105.69:117.33 BUT NOT TO WORRY IF WE START OVER AND SIMPLY GO THE OTHER DIRECTION AROUND THE BOW WE GET THIS THE STRONG FORM OF THE KNOT
TerryMoore_2005@117.34:121.27 AND IF YOU PULL THE CORDS UNDER THE KNOT YOU WILL SEE THAT THE BOW
TerryMoore_2005@141.61:146.5 GO THE OTHER WAY AROUND THE LOOP THIS IS A LITTLE HARD FOR CHILDREN BUT I THINK YOU CAN HANDLE
