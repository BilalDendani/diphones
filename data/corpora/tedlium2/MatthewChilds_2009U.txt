MatthewChilds_2009U NUMBER TWO HESITATION IS BAD THIS IS A FRICTION CLIMB UP IN TUOLUMNE MEADOWS IN THE YOSEMITE HIGH COUNTRY FRICTION CLIMBING DOESN'T HAVE ANY SORT OF HARD POSITIVE EDGES
MatthewChilds_2009U YOU'RE CLIMBING ON LITTLE DIMPLES AND NUBBINS IN THE ROCK THE MOST FRICTION YOU HAVE IS WHEN YOU FIRST PUT YOUR HAND OR YOUR
MatthewChilds_2009U ON THE ROCK AND THEN FROM THAT POINT ON YOU'RE BASICALLY FALLING SO MOMENTUM IS GOOD DON'T STOP

MatthewChilds_2009U OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE PLANNING SO HARD FOR LIKE HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS YOU GET TO THE LAST PITCH IT'S EASY AND YOU'RE COMPLETELY FLAMED OUT DON'T DO IT
MatthewChilds_2009U YOU HAVE TO PLAN AHEAD TO GET TO THE TOP BUT YOU ALSO CAN'T FORGET THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL MOVE YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THIS IS A
MatthewChilds_2009U CLIMB CALLED THE DIKE ROUTE ON PEYRAT DOME UP IN THE YOSEMITE HIGH COUNTRY THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS CLIMB IS IT'S NOT THAT HARD
MatthewChilds_2009U BUT IF YOU'RE THE LEADER ON IT AT THE HARDEST MOVE YOU'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FOOT FALL ONTO SOME LOW ANGLE SLABS
MatthewChilds_2009U SO YOU'VE GOT TO FOCUS YOU DON'T WANT TO STOP IN THE MIDDLE LIKE COLERIDGE 'S KUBLA KAHN YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP GOING

MatthewChilds_2009U THE CRACKS ARE TOO SMALL TO GET YOUR TOES INTO SO THE ONLY WAY TO CLIMB IS USING YOUR FINGERTIPS IN THE CRACKS
MatthewChilds_2009U AND USING OPPOSING PRESSURE AND FORCING YOURSELF UP RULE NUMBER EIGHT STRENGTH DOESN'T ALWAYS EQUAL SUCCESS IN THE THIRTY FIVE YEARS I'VE BEEN A CLIMBING GUIDE AND TAUGHT ON INDOOR WALLS AND STUFF LIKE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I'VE LEARNED

MatthewChilds_2009U ARE MUCH MORE IN BALANCE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT IDEA THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO ONE HUNDRED PULL UPS
MatthewChilds_2009U THEY THINK ABOUT HOW TO GET THE WEIGHT OVER THEIR FEET BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF NATURAL THEY CARRY YOU ALL DAY LONG SO BALANCE IS REALLY CRITICAL AND KEEPING YOUR WEIGHT ON YOUR FEET

MatthewChilds_2009U ABOUT FORTY FEET AND CRACKED A RIB ONCE YOU GET TO THAT POINT WHERE YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN YOU NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT
MatthewChilds_2009U HOW YOU'RE GOING TO LET GO BECAUSE THAT IS THE CRITICAL PIECE OF NOT GETTING HURT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO
MatthewChilds_2009U FALL ON TO THE ROPE OR IF YOU'RE CLIMBING WITHOUT A ROPE FALL TO A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY CONTROL THE FALL
