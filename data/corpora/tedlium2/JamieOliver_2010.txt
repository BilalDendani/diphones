JamieOliver_2010@367.08:378.94 I SEE IT AS A TRIANGLE OK THIS IS OUR LANDSCAPE OF FOOD I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND IT YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD ALL THIS BEFORE BUT LET 'S JUST GO BACK OVER IT OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS WHAT'S HAPPENED THAT'S RIPPED THE HEART OUT OF THIS COUNTRY LET 'S BE FRANK AND HONEST
JamieOliver_2010@380.96:381.48 WELL
JamieOliver_2010@382.11:384.57 MODERN DAY LIFE LET 'S START WITH THE MAIN STREET
JamieOliver_2010@385.53:398.39 FAST FOOD HAS TAKEN OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY WE KNOW THAT THE BIG BRANDS ARE SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POWERS POWERFUL POWERS IN THIS COUNTRY SUPERMARKETS AS WELL BIG COMPANIES BIG COMPANIES
JamieOliver_2010@399.68:413.41 THIRTY YEARS AGO MOST OF THE FOOD WAS LARGELY LOCAL AND LARGELY FRESH NOW IT'S LARGELY PROCESSED AND FULL OF ALL SORTS OF ADDITIVES EXTRA INGREDIENTS AND YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY PORTION SIZE IS OBVIOUSLY A MASSIVE MASSIVE PROBLEM
JamieOliver_2010@415.28:416.81 LABELING IS A MASSIVE PROBLEM
JamieOliver_2010@417.68:418.89 THE LABELING IN THIS COUNTRY IS
JamieOliver_2010@421.55:425.18 SELF THEY WANT TO SELF POLICE THEMSELVES THE INDUSTRY WANTS TO SELF POLICE THEMSELVES
JamieOliver_2010@426.30:427.97 WHAT IN THIS KIND OF CLIMATE THEY DON'T DESERVE
JamieOliver_2010@428.99:431.24 HOW CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING IS LOW FAT WHEN IT'S FULL OF SO MUCH
JamieOliver_2010@446.20:456.45 HAPPENING ANYMORE AND YOU KNOW AS WE GO TO WORK AND AS LIFE CHANGES AND AS LIFE ALWAYS EVOLVES WE KIND OF HAVE TO LOOK AT IT HOLISTICALLY STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT AND RE ADDRESS THE BALANCE
JamieOliver_2010@463.18:466.24 IS VERY NORMAL RIGHT NOW THE EDWARDS FAMILY
JamieOliver_2010@469.86:471.61 THIS STUFF GOES THROUGH YOU
JamieOliver_2010@482.61:485.21 REALLY SAD AND DEPRESSED RIGHT NOW
JamieOliver_2010@486.77:489.13 YOU KNOW I WANT MY KIDS TO SUCCEED IN LIFE
JamieOliver_2010@492.17:498.89 BUT I'M KILLING THEM JO YES YOU ARE YOU ARE BUT WE CAN STOP
JamieOliver_2010@507.41:511.80 SOMETHING THAT I'M FAIRLY MUCH A SPECIALIST IN OK SCHOOL
JamieOliver_2010@512.84:518.82 SCHOOL WHO INVENTED IT WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF SCHOOL SCHOOL WAS ALWAYS INVENTED TO ARM US WITH THE TOOLS TO MAKE US
JamieOliver_2010@519.86:527.68 DO WONDERFUL THINGS MAKE US EARN A LIVING ETC ETC ETC YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN KIND OF IN THIS SORT OF TIGHT BOX FOR A LONG LONG TIME OK
JamieOliver_2010@528.40:534.30 BUT WE HAVEN'T REALLY EVOLVED IT TO DEAL WITH THE HEALTH CATASTROPHES OF AMERICA OK SCHOOL
JamieOliver_2010@535.83:543.31 IS SOMETHING THAT MOST KIDS THIRTY ONE MILLION A DAY ACTUALLY HAVE TWICE A DAY MORE THAN OFTEN BREAKFAST AND LUNCH
JamieOliver_2010@544.47:550.76 AND EIGHTY DAYS OF THE YEAR SO YOU COULD SAY THAT SCHOOL FOOD IS QUITE IMPORTANT REALLY JUDGING THE CIRCUMSTANCES
JamieOliver_2010@556.55:559.14 BEFORE I CRACK INTO MY RANT WHICH I'M SURE
JamieOliver_2010@563.48:569.65 I NEED TO SAY ONE THING AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT IN HOPEFULLY THE MAGIC THAT HAPPENS AND UNFOLDS IN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS
JamieOliver_2010@570.26:573.17 THE LUNCH LADIES THE LUNCH COOKS OF AMERICA
JamieOliver_2010@574.85:576.55 OFFER MYSELF AS THEIR AMBASSADOR
JamieOliver_2010@577.10:580.42 I'M NOT SLACKING THEM OFF THEY'RE DOING THE BEST THEY CAN DO
JamieOliver_2010@585.47:590.64 BUT THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY'RE TOLD AND WHAT THEY'RE BEING TOLD TO DO IS WRONG THE SYSTEM IS
JamieOliver_2010@604.42:610.42 AND DIVE AND WRITE DIFFERENT THINGS AROUND THINGS IF YOU'RE AN ACCOUNTANT AND A BOX TICKER THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IS
JamieOliver_2010@612.57:613.69 NOW THE REALITY IS
JamieOliver_2010@614.15:622.31 THE FOOD THAT YOUR KIDS GET EVERY DAY IS FAST FOOD IT'S HIGHLY PROCESSED THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FRESH FOOD IN THERE AT ALL YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIVES
JamieOliver_2010@637.63:644.19 AND THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS IF YOU DON'T HAVE KNIVES AND FORKS IN YOUR SCHOOL YOU'RE PURELY ENDORSING FROM A STATE LEVEL
JamieOliver_2010@655.81:657.93 TEN PERCENT OF WHAT WE SPEND ON HEALTHCARE AS I SAID
JamieOliver_2010@659.57:661.30 OBESITY AND IT'S GOING TO DOUBLE
JamieOliver_2010@662.52:673.62 WE'RE NOT TEACHING OUR KIDS THERE IS NO STATUTORY RIGHT TO TEACH KIDS ABOUT FOOD ELEMENTARY OR SECONDARY SCHOOL OK WE DON'T TEACH KIDS ABOUT FOOD RIGHT AND THIS IS A LITTLE CLIP FROM AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHICH IS VERY COMMON
JamieOliver_2010@686.73:687.24 GOOD OLD
JamieOliver_2010@703.48:704.14 IF THE KIDS
JamieOliver_2010@712.64:718.64 AMERICA ENGLAND AND AMERICA GUESS WHAT FIXED THAT GUESS WHAT FIXED THAT TWO ONE HOUR SESSIONS
JamieOliver_2010@720.60:723.72 WE'VE GOT TO START TEACHING OUR KIDS ABOUT FOOD IN SCHOOLS PERIOD
JamieOliver_2010@731.55:732.66 TELL YOU ABOUT SOMETHING
JamieOliver_2010@733.15:741.21 I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT KIND OF EPITOMIZES THE TROUBLE THAT WE'RE IN GUYS OK I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING SO BASIC AS MILK
JamieOliver_2010@742.04:750.51 EVERY KID HAS THE RIGHT TO MILK AT SCHOOL YOUR KIDS WILL BE HAVING MILK AT SCHOOL BREAKFAST AND LUNCH RIGHT THEY'LL BE HAVING TWO BOTTLES OKAY AND MOST KIDS
JamieOliver_2010@751.14:765.24 BUT MILK AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH ANYMORE BECAUSE SOMEONE AT THE MILK BOARD RIGHT AND DON'T GET ME WRONG I SUPPORT MILK BUT SOMEONE ON THE MILK BOARD PROBABLY PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR SOME GEEZER TO WORK OUT THAT IF YOU PUT LOADS OF FLAVORINGS AND COLORINGS AND SUGAR IN MILK RIGHT MORE KIDS WILL DRINK IT
JamieOliver_2010@768.72:777.49 AND OBVIOUSLY NOW THAT'S GOING TO CATCH ON THE APPLE BOARD IS GOING TO WORK OUT THAT IF THEY MAKE TOFFEE APPLES THEY'LL EAT MORE APPLES AS WELL DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN FOR ME
JamieOliver_2010@778.06:786.50 NO NEED TO FLAVOR THE MILK OKAY THERE IS SUGAR IN EVERYTHING I KNOW THE INS AND OUTS OF THOSE INGREDIENTS IT'S IN EVERYTHING EVEN THE MILK HASN'T ESCAPED
JamieOliver_2010@786.79:798.64 THE KIND OF MODERN DAY PROBLEMS THERE'S OUR MILK THERE'S OUR CARTON IN THAT IS NEARLY AS MUCH SUGAR AS ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE CANS OF FIZZY POP AND THEY ARE HAVING TWO A DAY SO LET ME JUST SHOW YOU WE'VE GOT ONE
JamieOliver_2010@803.64:805.97 YOU KNOW EIGHT TABLESPOONS OF SUGAR
JamieOliver_2010@808.34:808.63 YOU
JamieOliver_2010@814.48:817.45 PUTTING IN JUST THE FIVE YEARS OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
JamieOliver_2010@821.95:823.01 JUST FROM MILK
JamieOliver_2010@826.38:839.91 NOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS BUT JUDGING THE CIRCUMSTANCES RIGHT ANY JUDGE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD LOOK AT THE STATISTICS AND THE EVIDENCE AND THEY WOULD FIND ANY GOVERNMENT OF OLD GUILTY OF CHILD ABUSE THAT'S
JamieOliver_2010@849.51:854.34 NOW IF I CAME UP HERE AND I WISH I COULD COME UP HERE TODAY AND HANG A CURE FOR AIDS OR
JamieOliver_2010@856.68:856.99 TO GET TO
JamieOliver_2010@859.59:861.66 ALL THIS BAD NEWS IS PREVENTABLE
JamieOliver_2010@862.39:865.74 THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS IT'S VERY VERY PREVENTABLE
JamieOliver_2010@866.66:870.14 SO LET 'S JUST THINK ABOUT WE GOT A PROBLEM HERE WE NEED TO REBOOT
JamieOliver_2010@871.79:872.83 OKAY SO
JamieOliver_2010@872.97:886.13 IN MY WORLD WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO HERE IS THE THING RIGHT IT CAN NOT JUST COME FROM ONE SOURCE TO REBOOT AND MAKE REAL TANGIBLE CHANGE REAL CHANGE SO THAT I COULD LOOK YOU IN THE WHITE OF THE EYES AND SAY IN TEN YEARS TIME
JamieOliver_2010@886.34:895.83 THE HISTORY OF YOUR CHILDREN 'S LIVES HAPPINESS AND LET 'S NOT FORGET YOU'RE CLEVER IF YOU EAT WELL YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE LONGER ALL OF THAT STUFF IT WILL LOOK DIFFERENT
JamieOliver_2010@912.98:926.59 THEY NEED TO HELP US SHOP THEY NEED TO SHOW US HOW TO COOK QUICK TASTY SEASONAL MEALS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE BUSY THIS IS NOT EXPENSIVE IT IS DONE IN SOME AND IT NEEDS TO BE DONE ACROSS THE BOARD IN AMERICA SOON AND QUICK
JamieOliver_2010@927.19:935.59 THE BIG BRANDS YOU KNOW THE FOOD BRANDS NEED TO PUT FOOD EDUCATION AT THE HEART OF THEIR BUSINESSES I KNOW EASIER SAID THAN DONE
JamieOliver_2010@935.91:944.23 IT'S THE FUTURE IT'S THE ONLY WAY FAST FOOD WITH THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY YOU KNOW IT'S VERY COMPETITIVE
JamieOliver_2010@956.74:965.14 RIGHT SO THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION BUT WE NEED TO GET THE GOVERNMENT TO WORK WITH ALL OF THE FAST FOOD PURVEYORS AND THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY
JamieOliver_2010@965.34:972.44 AND OVER A FIVE SIX SEVEN YEAR PERIOD WEAN OF US OFF THE EXTREME AMOUNTS OF FAT SUGAR FAT AND ALL THE OTHER NON FOOD
JamieOliver_2010@981.76:982.72 OK SCHOOL
JamieOliver_2010@994.29:996.62 PROPER FRESH FOOD
JamieOliver_2010@997.21:1002.52 FROM LOCAL GROWERS ON SITE OK THERE NEEDS TO BE A NEW STANDARD OF FRESH PROPER FOOD FOR YOUR CHILDREN
JamieOliver_2010@1007.85:1017.00 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT THAT EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN CHILD LEAVES SCHOOL KNOWING HOW TO COOK TEN RECIPES THAT WILL SAVE THEIR LIFE
JamieOliver_2010@1021.75:1022.86 THAT MEANS THAT THEY CAN BE
JamieOliver_2010@1023.73:1031.53 YOUNG PARENTS AND BE ABLE TO SORT OF DUCK AND DIVE AROUND THE BASICS OF COOKING NO MATTER WHAT RECESSION HITS THEM NEXT TIME IF YOU CAN COOK
JamieOliver_2010@1037.53:1039.65 THE WORKPLACE WE HADN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT IT
JamieOliver_2010@1041.45:1051.61 NOW TIME FOR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THEY FEED OR MAKE AVAILABLE TO THEIR STAFF THE STAFF ARE THE MOMS AND DADS OF AMERICA 'S CHILDREN MARISSA
JamieOliver_2010@1051.96:1061.57 FATHER DIED IN HER HAND I THINK SHE'D BE QUITE HAPPY IF CORPORATE AMERICA COULD START FEEDING THEIR STAFF PROPERLY DEFINITELY THEY SHOULDN 'T BE LEFT OUT LET 'S GO BACK TO THE HOME NOW
JamieOliver_2010@1062.10:1075.27 IF WE DO ALL THIS STUFF AND WE CAN IT'S SO ACHIEVABLE YOU CAN CARE AND BE COMMERCIAL ABSOLUTELY BUT THE HOME NEEDS TO START PASSING ON COOKING AGAIN FOR SURE FOR SURE PASS IT ON AS A PHILOSOPHY
JamieOliver_2010@1075.69:1088.99 AND FOR ME IT'S QUITE ROMANTIC BUT IT'S ABOUT IF ONE PERSON TEACHES THREE PEOPLE HOW TO COOK SOMETHING AND NOW THEY TEACH THREE OF THEIR MATES THAT ONLY HAS TO REPEAT ITSELF TWENTY FIVE TIMES AND THAT'S THE WHOLE POPULATION OF AMERICA ROMANTIC YES
JamieOliver_2010@1089.91:1101.78 BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO REALIZE THAT EVERY ONE OF YOUR INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS MAKES A DIFFERENCE WE'VE GOT TO PUT BACK WHAT'S BEEN LOST HUNTINGTON KITCHEN
JamieOliver_2010@1125.91:1127.62 SIX AND A HALF GRAND PER SCHOOL
JamieOliver_2010@1129.01:1136.74 FIVE GRAND A MONTH OKAY THIS CAN DO FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR WHICH IS TEN PERCENT OF THEIR POPULATION AND IT'S PEOPLE ON PEOPLE
JamieOliver_2010@1136.93:1147.13 YOU KNOW IT'S LOCAL COOKS TEACHING LOCAL PEOPLE IT'S FREE COOKING LESSONS GUYS FREE COOKING LESSONS IN THE MAIN STREET THIS IS REAL TANGIBLE CHANGE REAL TANGIBLE CHANGE
JamieOliver_2010@1147.95:1152.70 AROUND AMERICA IF WE JUST LOOK BACK NOW THERE IS PLENTY OF WONDERFUL THINGS GOING ON
JamieOliver_2010@1160.59:1161.64 FARM TO SCHOOL SET
JamieOliver_2010@1162.61:1172.80 GARDEN SET UPS EDUCATION THERE ARE AMAZING PEOPLE DOING THIS ALREADY THE PROBLEM IS THEY ALL WANT TO ROLL OUT WHAT THEIR DOING TO THE NEXT SCHOOL AND THE NEXT BUT THERE IS NO CASH
JamieOliver_2010@1173.44:1181.18 WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE EXPERTS AND THE ANGELS QUICKLY IDENTIFY THEM AND ALLOW THEM TO EASILY FIND THE RESOURCE TO KEEP ROLLING OUT
JamieOliver_2010@1181.36:1189.00 WHAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING AND DOING WELL BUSINESSES OF AMERICA NEED TO SUPPORT MISTERS OBAMA TO DO THE THINGS THAT SHE WANTS TO DO
JamieOliver_2010@1196.72:1206.58 I KNOW IT'S WEIRD HAVING AN ENGLISH PERSON STANDING HERE BEFORE YOU TALKING ABOUT ALL THIS ALL I CAN SAY IS I CARE I'M A FATHER AND I LOVE THIS COUNTRY
JamieOliver_2010@1207.34:1212.78 AND I BELIEVE TRULY ACTUALLY THAT IF CHANGE CAN BE MADE IN THIS COUNTRY
JamieOliver_2010@1229.63:1231.16 I THOUGH IF I HAD A MAGIC WAND
JamieOliver_2010@1233.90:1241.56 WHAT WOULD I DO AND I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT I'D JUST LOVE TO BE PUT IN FRONT OF SOME OF THE MOST AMAZING MOVERS AND SHAKERS IN AMERICA
