AnthonyAtala_2011 A MAJOR HEALTH CRISIS TODAY IN TERMS OF THE SHORTAGE OF ORGANS
AnthonyAtala_2011 THE FACT IS THAT WE 'RE LIVING LONGER MEDICINE HAS DONE A MUCH BETTER JOB OF MAKING US LIVE LONGER AND THE PROBLEM IS AS WE AGE OUR ORGANS TEND TO FAIL MORE
AnthonyAtala_2011 AND SO CURRENTLY THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH ORGANS TO GO AROUND IN FACT IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS REQUIRING AN ORGAN HAS DOUBLED WHILE IN THE SAME TIME THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF TRANSPLANTS HAS BARELY GONE UP
AnthonyAtala_2011 SO THIS IS NOW A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS SO THAT 'S WHERE THIS FIELD COMES IN THAT WE CALL THE FIELD OF REGENERATIVE MEDICINE
AnthonyAtala_2011 IT REALLY INVOLVES MANY DIFFERENT AREAS YOU CAN USE ACTUALLY SCAFFOLDS BIOMATERIALS THEY 'RE LIKE THE PIECE OF YOUR BLOUSE OR YOUR SHIRT BUT SPECIFIC MATERIALS YOU CAN ACTUALLY IMPLANT IN PATIENTS AND THEY WILL DO WELL AND HELP YOU REGENERATE OR WE CAN USE CELLS ALONE EITHER YOUR VERY OWN CELLS
AnthonyAtala_2011 OR DIFFERENT STEM CELL POPULATIONS
AnthonyAtala_2011 OR WE CAN USE BOTH WE CAN USE ACTUALLY BIOMATERIALS
AnthonyAtala_2011 BUT IT 'S ACTUALLY NOT A NEW FIELD
AnthonyAtala_2011 CHARLES LINDBERGH THAT 'S THE SAME CHARLES LINDBERGH WHO ACTUALLY SPENT THE REST OF HIS LIFE WORKING WITH ALEXIS AT THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE IN NEW YORK
AnthonyAtala_2011 IN THE AREA OF THE CULTURE OF ORGANS SO IF THE FIELD 'S BEEN AROUND FOR SO LONG WHY SO FEW CLINICAL ADVANCES AND THAT REALLY HAS TO DO TO MANY DIFFERENT CHALLENGES BUT IF I WERE TO POINT TO THREE CHALLENGES
AnthonyAtala_2011 THE FIRST ONE IS ACTUALLY THE DESIGN OF MATERIALS THAT COULD GO IN YOUR BODY AND DO WELL OVER TIME AND MANY ADVANCES NOW WE CAN DO THAT FAIRLY READILY THE SECOND CHALLENGE WAS CELLS WE COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF YOUR CELLS TO GROW OUTSIDE OF YOUR BODY
AnthonyAtala_2011 AND THE THIRD CHALLENGE IS VASCULARITY THE ACTUAL SUPPLY OF BLOOD TO ALLOW THOSE ORGANS OR TISSUES TO SURVIVE ONCE WE REGENERATE THEM SO WE CAN ACTUALLY USE BIOMATERIALS NOW THIS IS ACTUALLY A BIOMATERIAL WE CAN WEAVE THEM KNIT THEM OR WE CAN MAKE THEM LIKE YOU SEE HERE THIS IS ACTUALLY LIKE A COTTON CANDY MACHINE
AnthonyAtala_2011 YOU SAW THE SPRAY GOING IN THAT WAS LIKE THE FIBERS OF THE COTTON CANDY CREATING THIS STRUCTURE THIS TUBULARIZED STRUCTURE WHICH IS A BIOMATERIAL THAT WE CAN THEN USE
AnthonyAtala_2011 TO HELP YOUR BODY REGENERATE USING YOUR VERY OWN CELLS TO DO SO
AnthonyAtala_2011 AND THAT 'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID HERE THIS IS ACTUALLY A PATIENT WHO WAS PRESENTED WITH A DECEASED ORGAN
AnthonyAtala_2011 AND WE THEN CREATED ONE OF THESE SMART BIOMATERIALS AND THEN WE THEN USED THAT SMART BIOMATERIAL TO REPLACE
AnthonyAtala_2011 AND REPAIR THAT PATIENT 'S STRUCTURE WHAT WE DID WAS WE ACTUALLY USED THE BIOMATERIAL AS A BRIDGE SO THAT THE CELLS IN THE ORGAN COULD WALK ON THAT BRIDGE IF YOU WILL
AnthonyAtala_2011 AND HELP TO BRIDGE THE GAP TO REGENERATE THAT TISSUE AND YOU SEE THAT PATIENT NOW SIX MONTHS AFTER WITH AN X RAY SHOWING YOU THE REGENERATED TISSUE WHICH IS FULLY REGENERATED WHEN YOU ANALYZE IT UNDER THE MICROSCOPE
AnthonyAtala_2011 WE CAN ALSO USE CELLS ALONE
AnthonyAtala_2011 THESE ARE ACTUALLY CELLS THAT WE OBTAINED THESE ARE STEM CELLS THAT WE CREATE FROM SPECIFIC SOURCES AND WE CAN DRIVE THEM TO BECOME HEART CELLS AND THEY START BEATING IN CULTURE SO THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO THE CELLS GENETICALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO AND THEY START BEATING TOGETHER NOW
AnthonyAtala_2011 TODAY MANY CLINICAL TRIALS ARE USING DIFFERENT KINDS OF STEM CELLS FOR HEART DISEASE
AnthonyAtala_2011 SO THAT 'S ACTUALLY NOW IN PATIENTS OR IF WE 'RE GOING TO USE LARGER STRUCTURES TO REPLACE LARGER STRUCTURES WE CAN THEN USE THE PATIENT 'S OWN CELLS
AnthonyAtala_2011 OR SOME CELL POPULATION AND THE BIOMATERIALS THE SCAFFOLDS TOGETHER SO THE CONCEPT HERE SO IF YOU DO HAVE A DECEASED OR INJURED ORGAN WE TAKE A VERY SMALL PIECE OF THAT TISSUE LESS THAN HALF
AnthonyAtala_2011 THE SIZE OF A POSTAGE STAMP
AnthonyAtala_2011 WE THEN TEASE THE CELLS APART WE GROW THE CELLS OUTSIDE THE BODY
AnthonyAtala_2011 WE THEN TAKE A SCAFFOLD A BIOMATERIAL AGAIN LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE A PIECE OF YOUR BLOUSE OR YOUR SHIRT WE THEN SHAPE THAT MATERIAL AND WE THEN USE THOSE CELLS TO COAT THAT MATERIAL ONE LAYER AT A TIME
AnthonyAtala_2011 VERY MUCH LIKE BAKING A LAYER CAKE IF YOU WILL
AnthonyAtala_2011 WE THEN PLACE IT IN AN OVEN LIKE DEVICE AND WE 'RE ABLE TO CREATE THAT STRUCTURE AND BRING IT OUT
AnthonyAtala_2011 THIS IS ACTUALLY A HEART VALVE
AnthonyAtala_2011 AND YOU CAN SEE HERE WE HAVE THE STRUCTURE OF THE HEART VALVE AND WE 'VE SEEDED THAT WITH CELLS
AnthonyAtala_2011 AND THEN WE EXERCISE IT SO YOU SEE THE LEAFLETS OPENING AND CLOSING
AnthonyAtala_2011 OF THIS HEART VALVE
AnthonyAtala_2011 THAT 'S CURRENTLY BEING USED EXPERIMENTALLY TO TRY TO GET IT TO FURTHER STUDIES
AnthonyAtala_2011 ANOTHER TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE USED IN PATIENTS ACTUALLY INVOLVES BLADDERS WE ACTUALLY TAKE A VERY SMALL PIECE OF THE BLADDER FROM THE PATIENT LESS THAN HALF THE SIZE OF A POSTAGE STAMP
AnthonyAtala_2011 WE THEN GROW THE CELLS OUTSIDE THE BODY TAKE THE SCAFFOLD COAT THE SCAFFOLD WITH THE CELLS THE PATIENT 'S OWN CELLS TWO DIFFERENT CELL TYPES WE THEN PUT IT IN THIS OVEN LIKE DEVICE IT HAS THE SAME CONDITIONS AS THE HUMAN BODY THIRTY SEVEN
AnthonyAtala_2011 BUT WE NOW HAVE BETTER WAYS TO CREATE THESE STRUCTURES WITH THE CELLS WE USE NOW SOME TYPE OF
AnthonyAtala_2011 TECHNOLOGIES WHERE FOR SOLID ORGANS FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THE LIVER
AnthonyAtala_2011 WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE DISCARD LIVERS AS YOU KNOW A LOT OF ORGANS ARE ACTUALLY DISCARDED NOT USED SO WE CAN TAKE THESE LIVER STRUCTURES WHICH ARE NOT GOING TO BE USED AND WE THEN PUT THEM IN A WASHING MACHINE LIKE STRUCTURE
AnthonyAtala_2011 THAT WILL ALLOW THE CELLS TO BE WASHED AWAY TWO WEEKS LATER YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A LIVER YOU CAN HOLD IT LIKE A LIVER BUT IT HAS NO CELLS IT 'S JUST A SKELETON OF THE LIVER
AnthonyAtala_2011 AND WE THEN CAN RE PERFUSE THE LIVER WITH CELLS
AnthonyAtala_2011 ANOTHER TECHNOLOGY THAT WE 'VE USED IS ACTUALLY THAT OF PRINTING THIS IS
AnthonyAtala_2011 ACTUALLY A DESKTOP INKJET PRINTER BUT INSTEAD OF USING INK WE 'RE USING CELLS
AnthonyAtala_2011 AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE HERE THE PRINTHEAD GOING THROUGH AND PRINTING THIS STRUCTURE AND IT TAKES ABOUT FORTY MINUTES TO PRINT THIS STRUCTURE AND THERE 'S A THREE D ELEVATOR THAT THEN ACTUALLY GOES DOWN ONE LAYER AT A TIME EACH TIME THE PRINTHEAD GOES THROUGH AND THEN FINALLY YOU 'RE ABLE TO GET THAT STRUCTURE OUT
AnthonyAtala_2011 YOU CAN POP THAT STRUCTURE OUT OF THE PRINTER AND IMPLANT IT AND THIS IS ACTUALLY A PIECE OF BONE THAT I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IN THIS SLIDE THAT WAS ACTUALLY CREATED WITH THIS DESKTOP PRINTER AND IMPLANTED AS YOU SEE HERE THAT WAS ALL NEW BONE THAT WAS IMPLANTED USING THESE TECHNIQUES
AnthonyAtala_2011 I KNOW IT SOUNDS FUNNY BUT THAT 'S THE WAY IT WORKS BECAUSE IN REALITY
AnthonyAtala_2011 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO HAVE THE PATIENT ON THE BED WITH THE WOUND AND YOU HAVE A SCANNER BASICALLY LIKE A FLATBED SCANNER THAT 'S WHAT YOU SEE HERE ON THE RIGHT SIDE YOU SEE A SCANNER TECHNOLOGY THAT FIRST SCANS THE WOUND ON THE PATIENT
AnthonyAtala_2011 AND THEN IT COMES BACK WITH THE PRINTHEADS ACTUALLY PRINTING THE LAYERS THAT YOU REQUIRE ON THE PATIENTS THEMSELVES
AnthonyAtala_2011 THIS IS HOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS HERE 'S THE SCANNER GOING THROUGH SCANNING THE WOUND
AnthonyAtala_2011 WHERE THEY NEED TO BE AND THIS IS ACTUALLY NEW TECHNOLOGY STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT
AnthonyAtala_2011 WE 'RE ALSO WORKING ON MORE SOPHISTICATED PRINTERS BECAUSE IN REALITY OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE ARE THE SOLID ORGANS
AnthonyAtala_2011 I DON 'T KNOW IF YOU REALIZE THIS BUT NINETY PERCENT
AnthonyAtala_2011 OF THE PATIENTS ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST ARE ACTUALLY WAITING FOR A KIDNEY PATIENTS ARE DYING EVERY DAY BECAUSE WE DON 'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THOSE ORGANS TO GO AROUND SO THIS IS MORE CHALLENGING LARGE ORGAN VASCULAR A LOT OF BLOOD VESSEL SUPPLY A LOT OF CELLS PRESENT
AnthonyAtala_2011 SO THE STRATEGY HERE IS THIS IS ACTUALLY A CT SCAN AN X RAY
AnthonyAtala_2011 AND WE GO LAYER BY LAYER USING COMPUTERIZED MORPHOMETRIC IMAGING ANALYSIS AND THREE D RECONSTRUCTION TO GET RIGHT DOWN TO THOSE PATIENT 'S OWN KIDNEYS
AnthonyAtala_2011 WE THEN ARE ABLE TO ACTUALLY IMAGE THOSE
AnthonyAtala_2011 DO THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DEGREE ROTATION TO ANALYZE THE KIDNEY IN ITS FULL VOLUMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS AND WE THEN ARE ABLE TO ACTUALLY TAKE THIS INFORMATION AND THEN SCAN THIS IN A PRINTING COMPUTERIZED FORM SO WE GO LAYER BY LAYER THROUGH THE ORGAN
AnthonyAtala_2011 ANALYZING EACH LAYER AS WE GO THROUGH THE ORGAN AND WE THEN ARE ABLE TO SEND THAT INFORMATION AS YOU SEE HERE THROUGH THE COMPUTER AND ACTUALLY DESIGN THE ORGAN FOR THE PATIENT
AnthonyAtala_2011 THIS ACTUALLY SHOWS
AnthonyAtala_2011 AND THAT 'S BEEN PRINTING THIS KIDNEY STRUCTURE THAT YOU SEE HERE
AnthonyAtala_2011 IT TAKES ABOUT SEVEN HOURS TO PRINT A KIDNEY SO THIS IS ABOUT THREE HOURS INTO IT NOW
AnthonyAtala_2011 AND DR KANG 'S GOING TO WALK ONSTAGE RIGHT NOW
AnthonyAtala_2011 AND WE 'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO SHOW YOU ONE OF THESE KIDNEYS THAT WE PRINTED A LITTLE BIT EARLIER TODAY
AnthonyAtala_2011 THIS IS DR KANG WHO 'S BEEN WORKING WITH US ON THIS PROJECT AND PART OF OUR TEAM THANK YOU DR
AnthonyAtala_2011 I FELT SO SICK I WAS FACING BASICALLY A LIFETIME OF DIALYSIS
AnthonyAtala_2011 THESE EXPERIMENTS SOMETIMES WORK
AnthonyAtala_2011 AND IT 'S VERY COOL WHEN THEY DO LUKE COME UP PLEASE
AnthonyAtala_2011 TONY 'S REALLY SHY
AnthonyAtala_2011 AND IT TOOK A LOT OF CONVINCING TO GET SOMEBODY AS MODEST AS TONY TO ALLOW US TO BRING LUKE
AnthonyAtala_2011 SO LUKE YOU GO TO YOUR COMMUNICATIONS PROFESSORS YOU 'RE MAJORING IN COMMUNICATIONS AND YOU ASK THEM FOR PERMISSION TO COME TO TED WHICH MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE BIT TO DO WITH COMMUNICATIONS
