RodneyMullen_2012X@112.64:115.65 PICTURES IN THE MAGAZINES THAT A COUPLE OTHER GUYS SKATE
RodneyMullen_2012X@115.72:124.34 I THOUGHT WOW THAT 'S FOR ME YOU KNOW BECAUSE THERE WAS NO COACH STANDING DIRECTLY OVER YOU AND THESE GUYS THEY WERE JUST BEING THEMSELVES THERE WAS NO OPPONENT DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM YOU
RodneyMullen_2012X@149.31:151.03 WHICH WAS AMAZING TO ME
RodneyMullen_2012X@170.01:173.81 BUT THAT 'S WHY THEY CALLED ME THE GODFATHER OF MODERN STREET SKATING
RodneyMullen_2012X@174.27:176.59 HERE 'S SOME IMAGES OF THAT
RodneyMullen_2012X@181.12:184.13 NOW I WAS ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH MY PRO CAREER
RodneyMullen_2012X@200.78:210.67 THEY WERE USING IT TO GET UP ONTO STUFF LIKE BLEACHERS AND HANDRAILS AND OVER STAIRWELLS AND ALL KINDS OF COOL STUFF SO IT WAS EVOLVING UPWARDS IN FACT WHEN SOMEONE TELLS
RodneyMullen_2012X@242.15:247.69 THE CRAZY THING WAS THERE WAS A REALLY LIBERATING SENSE ABOUT IT BECAUSE I NO LONGER HAD TO PROTECT
RodneyMullen_2012X@248.41:254.22 MY RECORD AS A CHAMPION CHAMPION AGAIN CHAMPION SOUNDS SO GOOFY BUT IT 'S WHAT IT WAS RIGHT
RodneyMullen_2012X@262.17:270.96 ALWAYS WAS CREATING NEW STUFF THE OTHER THING THAT I HAD WAS A DEEP WELL OF TRICKS TO DRAW FROM THAT WERE ROOTED IN THESE FLAT GROUND TRICKS
RodneyMullen_2012X@271.06:273.91 STUFF THE NORMAL GUYS WERE DOING WAS VERY MUCH DIFFERENT
RodneyMullen_2012X@274.1:292.03 SO AS HUMBLING AND ROTTEN AS IT WAS AND BELIEVE ME IT WAS ROTTEN I WOULD GO TO SKATE SPOTS AND I WAS ALREADY LIKE FAMOUS GUY RIGHT AND EVERYONE THOUGHT I WAS GOOD BUT IN THIS NEW TERRAIN I WAS HORRIBLE SO PEOPLE WOULD GO OH HE 'S ALL OH WHAT HAPPENED TO MULLEN
RodneyMullen_2012X@293.84:299.04 I BEGAN AGAIN HERE ARE SOME TRICKS THAT I STARTED TO BRING TO THAT NEW TERRAIN
RodneyMullen_2012X@343.52:351.14 IT 'S JUST THE WAY YOU THROW YOUR BOARD OVER JUST LET THE LEDGE DO THAT AND IT 'S EASY AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THERE 'S TWENTY MORE TRICKS BASED OUT OF THE VARIATIONS
RodneyMullen_2012X@351.53:356.31 SO THAT 'S THE KIND OF THING THAT HERE CHECK THIS OUT HERE 'S ANOTHER WAY AND I WON 'T OVERDO THIS
RodneyMullen_2012X@437.87:439.62 ALL I WAS THINKING IS
RodneyMullen_2012X@469.02:478.32 BUT SUDDENLY BECAUSE YOU ALREADY HAVE SOMETHING IN THIS FIXED DOMAIN OF THIS TARGET IT 'S LIKE WHAT WILL MATCH THIS TRICK HOW CAN I

RodneyMullen_2012X@610.95:616.64 AND SIXTY FLIP AND SO THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE ALL OF THESE TRICKS ARE MADE OF
RodneyMullen_2012X@628.1:637.48 AND SO AS I 'M GOING UP THESE THINGS ARE FLOATING AROUND AND YOU HAVE TO SORT OF LET THE COGNITIVE MIND LIKE REST BACK PULL IT BACK A LITTLE BIT AND LET YOUR INTUITION GO AS YOU FEEL THESE THINGS
RodneyMullen_2012X@651.02:652.83 SO NEXT OH MIND YOU
RodneyMullen_2012X@661.32:663.11 AND THE BEAUTY OF SKATEBOARDING
RodneyMullen_2012X@693.48:695.31 WHO SEEK A SENSE OF
RodneyMullen_2012X@706.52:714.47 WE TAKE THAT WE MAKE IT OUR OWN AND THEN WE CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY THE INNER WAY THAT EDIFIES THE COMMUNITY ITSELF
RodneyMullen_2012X@715.02:716.72 THE GREATER THE CONTRIBUTION
RodneyMullen_2012X@717.41:720.48 THE MORE WE EXPRESS AND FORM OUR INDIVIDUALITY
RodneyMullen_2012X@721.42:725.42 WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT TO A LOT OF US WHO FEEL LIKE REJECTS TO BEGIN WITH
RodneyMullen_2012X@725.79:727.89 THE SUMMATION OF THAT
RodneyMullen_2012X@728.39:731.47 GIVES US SOMETHING WE COULD NEVER ACHIEVE AS AN INDIVIDUAL
RodneyMullen_2012X@732.86:736 I SHOULD SAY THIS THERE 'S SOME SORT OF BEAUTIFUL SYMMETRY
RodneyMullen_2012X@785.74:789.93 DISPARATE INFORMATION AND THEY BRING IT TOGETHER IN A WAY
RodneyMullen_2012X@802.72:807.41 AND THE OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY THE BASIC ETHOS OF IT IS TAKE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DO
RodneyMullen_2012X@808.05:813.42 MAKE IT BETTER GIVE IT BACK SO WE ALL RISE FURTHER VERY SIMILAR COMMUNITIES VERY SIMILAR
RodneyMullen_2012X@813.84:815.75 WE HAVE OUR EDGIER SIDES
RodneyMullen_2012X@816.93:819.57 IT 'S FUNNY MY DAD WAS RIGHT THESE ARE MY PEERS
RodneyMullen_2012X@821.05:824.57 BUT I RESPECT WHAT THEY DO AND THEY RESPECT WHAT I DO BECAUSE THEY CAN DO THINGS
RodneyMullen_2012X@824.85:827.62 IT 'S AMAZING WHAT THEY CAN DO IN FACT ONE OF THEM
RodneyMullen_2012X@828.03:829.59 HE WAS ERNST YOUNG
RodneyMullen_2012X@849.2:854.9 AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AND THEN IT BECAME THE BIGGEST AGAIN WHICH IS HARDER THAN THE FIRST TIME AND THEN WE SOLD IT AND THEN WE SOLD IT AGAIN
RodneyMullen_2012X@947.35:961.1 AND IT RESONATED BECAUSE I HAD WON THIRTY FIVE OUT OF THIRTY SIX CONTESTS THAT I 'D ENTERED OVER ELEVEN YEARS AND IT MADE ME BANANAS IN FACT WINNING ISN 'T THE WORD I WON IT ONCE THE REST OF THE TIME YOU 'RE JUST DEFENDING AND YOU GET INTO THIS LIKE TURTLE POSTURE YOU
RodneyMullen_2012X@976.16:985.98 ON THE VERY EDGE OF PREACHY RIGHT HERE I 'M NOT HERE TO DO THAT IT 'S JUST THAT I 'M IN FRONT OF A VERY PRIVILEGED AUDIENCE IF YOU GUYS AREN 'T ALREADY LEADERS IN YOUR COMMUNITY YOU PROBABLY WILL BE
RodneyMullen_2012X@993.93:1001.42 IT 'S NOT FAME IT 'S NOT ALL THESE THINGS WHAT IT IS IS THAT THERE 'S AN INTRINSIC VALUE IN CREATING SOMETHING FOR THE SAKE OF CREATING
RodneyMullen_2012X@1015.81:1022.01 AND SEEING IT DISPERSED AND SEEING YOUNGER MORE TALENTED JUST DIFFERENT TALENT TAKE IT TO LEVELS YOU CAN NEVER IMAGINE
RodneyMullen_2012X@1073.94:1078.59 AND SO THAT 'S WHAT I PROCEEDED TO DO THROUGH A LONG STORY ONE OF DESPERATION
