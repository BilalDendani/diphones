JeremyGilley_2011G@16.41:35.76 BASICALLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE WORLD I COULDN 'T UNDERSTAND THE STARVATION THE DESTRUCTION THE KILLING OF INNOCENT PEOPLE MAKING SENSE OF THOSE THINGS IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO AND WHEN I WAS TWELVE I BECAME AN ACTOR I WAS BOTTOM OF THE CLASS I HAVEN 'T GOT ANY QUALIFICATIONS
JeremyGilley_2011G@35.77:39.63 I WAS TOLD I WAS DYSLEXIC IN FACT I HAVE
JeremyGilley_2011G@48.03:63.88 AND THEN BEING AN ACTOR I WAS DOING THESE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS AND I FELT THE CONTENT OF THE WORK THAT I WAS INVOLVED IN REALLY WASN 'T CUTTING IT THAT THERE SURELY HAD TO BE MORE AND AT THAT POINT I READ A BOOK BY FRANK BARNABY THIS WONDERFUL NUCLEAR PHYSICIST AND HE SAID THAT MEDIA HAD A RESPONSIBILITY THAT ALL SECTORS OF SOCIETY
JeremyGilley_2011G@72.41:85.18 AND THEN I THOUGHT WELL MAYBE I COULD DO SOMETHING MAYBE I COULD BECOME A FILMMAKER MAYBE I CAN USE THE FORM OF FILM CONSTRUCTIVELY TO IN SOME WAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE MAYBE THERE 'S A LITTLE CHANGE I CAN GET INVOLVED IN SO I STARTED THINKING ABOUT PEACE
JeremyGilley_2011G@85.18:97.69 AND I WAS OBVIOUSLY AS I SAID TO YOU VERY MUCH MOVED BY THESE IMAGES TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THAT COULD I GO AND SPEAK TO OLDER AND WISER PEOPLE WHO WOULD TELL ME HOW THEY MADE SENSE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON
JeremyGilley_2011G@97.69:106.51 BECAUSE IT 'S OBVIOUSLY INCREDIBLY FRIGHTENING BUT I REALIZED THAT HAVING BEEN MESSING AROUND WITH STRUCTURE AS AN ACTOR THAT A SERIES OF SOUND BITES IN ITSELF WASN 'T ENOUGH
JeremyGilley_2011G@124.38:144.21 SO I WAS THINKING ABOUT PEACE AND THEN I WAS THINKING WELL WHERE 'S THE STARTING POINT FOR PEACE AND THAT WAS WHEN I HAD THE IDEA THERE WAS NO STARTING POINT FOR PEACE THERE WAS NO DAY OF GLOBAL UNITY THERE WAS NO DAY OF INTERCULTURAL COOPERATION THERE WAS NO DAY WHEN HUMANITY CAME TOGETHER SEPARATE IN ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND JUST SHARED IT TOGETHER THAT WE 'RE IN THIS TOGETHER
JeremyGilley_2011G@144.21:156.23 AND THAT IF WE UNITED AND WE INTERCULTURALLY COOPERATED THEN THAT MIGHT BE THE KEY TO HUMANITY 'S SURVIVAL THAT MIGHT SHIFT THE LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS AROUND THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES THAT HUMANITY FACES IF WE DID IT JUST FOR A DAY
JeremyGilley_2011G@156.23:167.48 SO OBVIOUSLY WE DIDN 'T HAVE ANY MONEY I WAS LIVING AT MY MOM 'S PLACE AND WE STARTED WRITING LETTERS TO EVERYBODY YOU VERY QUICKLY WORK OUT WHAT IS IT THAT YOU 'VE GOT TO DO
JeremyGilley_2011G@180.07:191.82 HE WAS A PRISONER OF WAR HE SAW THE BOMB GO OFF AT NAGASAKI IT POISONED HIS BLOOD HE DIED WHEN I WAS ELEVEN SO HE WAS LIKE MY HERO AND THE REASON WHY TWENTY ONE WAS THE NUMBER IS SEVEN HUNDRED MEN LEFT
JeremyGilley_2011G@245.49:247.89 AND ACTUALLY LET ME GO BACK TO THAT SLIDE BECAUSE
JeremyGilley_2011G@247.89:262.04 WHEN WE LAUNCHED IT IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE THIS IDEA TO CREATE THE FIRST EVER DAY OF CEASEFIRE AND NON VIOLENCE WE INVITED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WELL NOT THOUSANDS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE LOTS OF PEOPLE ALL THE PRESS BECAUSE WE WERE GOING TO TRY AND CREATE THE FIRST EVER WORLD PEACE DAY A PEACE DAY
JeremyGilley_2011G@313.79:333.33 THE OAU AT THE TIME LED BY SALIM AHMED SALIM SAID I MUST GET THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES INVOLVED DR OSCAR ARIAS NOBEL PEACE LAUREATE PRESIDENT NOW OF COSTA RICA SAID I 'LL DO EVERYTHING THAT I CAN SO I WENT AND SAW AMR MOUSSA AT THE LEAGUE OF ARAB STATES I MET MANDELA AT THE ARUSHA PEACE TALKS AND SO ON AND SO ON AND SO ON WHILE I WAS BUILDING THE CASE TO PROVE
JeremyGilley_2011G@342.37:344.96 AND I 'VE ALWAYS SPOKEN TO WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHEREVER I 'VE GONE
JeremyGilley_2011G@377.27:380.43 AND IT WAS THIS STUFF THIS
JeremyGilley_2011G@380.43:393.08 WHERE I ACTUALLY WAS IN THE BEGINNING KIND OF THINKING NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED IT DIDN 'T ACTUALLY MATTER IT DIDN 'T MATTER IF IT DIDN 'T CREATE A DAY OF PEACE THE FACT IS THAT IF I TRIED AND IT DIDN 'T WORK THEN I COULD MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT HOW UNWILLING THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY IS TO UNITE
JeremyGilley_2011G@393.08:412.49 UNTIL IT WAS IN SOMALIA PICKING UP THAT YOUNG GIRL AND THIS YOUNG CHILD WHO 'D TAKEN ABOUT AN INCH AND A HALF OUT OF HER LEG WITH NO ANTISEPTIC AND THAT YOUNG BOY WHO WAS A CHILD SOLDIER WHO TOLD ME HE 'D KILLED PEOPLE HE WAS ABOUT TWELVE THESE THINGS MADE ME REALIZE THAT THIS WAS NOT A FILM THAT I COULD JUST STOP
JeremyGilley_2011G@412.49:422.91 AND THAT ACTUALLY AT THAT MOMENT SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME WHICH OBVIOUSLY MADE ME GO I 'M GOING TO DOCUMENT IF THIS IS THE ONLY FILM THAT I EVER MAKE I 'M GOING TO DOCUMENT UNTIL THIS BECOMES A REALITY
JeremyGilley_2011G@422.91:433.18 BECAUSE WE 'VE GOT TO STOP WE 'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING WHERE WE UNITE SEPARATE FROM ALL THE POLITICS AND RELIGION THAT AS A YOUNG PERSON IS CONFUSING ME I DON 'T KNOW HOW TO GET INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS
JeremyGilley_2011G@433.18:435.07 AND THEN ON THE SEVENTH OF SEPTEMBER
JeremyGilley_2011G@435.07:451.75 I WAS INVITED TO NEW YORK THE COSTA RICAN GOVERNMENT AND THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAD PUT FORWARD TO THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY WITH FIFTY FOUR CO SPONSORS THE IDEA OF THE FIRST EVER CEASEFIRE NONVIOLENCE DAY THE TWENTY FIRST OF SEPTEMBER AS A FIXED CALENDAR DATE AND IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY EVERY HEAD OF STATE IN THE WORLD
JeremyGilley_2011G@482.83:487.54 AND IT WAS EIGHT ZERO AM WHEN I STOOD THERE AND I WAS WAITING FOR HIM TO COME DOWN AND I KNEW THAT HE WAS ON HIS WAY
JeremyGilley_2011G@487.54:500.68 AND OBVIOUSLY HE NEVER CAME DOWN THE STATEMENT WAS NEVER MADE THE WORLD WAS NEVER TOLD THERE WAS A DAY OF GLOBAL CEASEFIRE AND NONVIOLENCE AND IT WAS OBVIOUSLY A TRAGIC MOMENT FOR THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES THERE AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY ALL OVER THE WORLD
JeremyGilley_2011G@500.76:508.89 IT NEVER HAPPENED AND I REMEMBER THINKING THIS IS EXACTLY WHY ACTUALLY WE HAVE TO WORK EVEN HARDER
JeremyGilley_2011G@508.89:516.35 AND WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS DAY WORK IT 'S BEEN CREATED NOBODY KNOWS BUT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE THIS JOURNEY
JeremyGilley_2011G@516.35:520.77 AND WE HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TO PROVE IT CAN WORK AND I LEFT NEW YORK
JeremyGilley_2011G@566.63:574.46 CHILDREN CAN LEAD THEIR PROJECTS THEY CAN UNITE THEY CAN COME TOGETHER IF PEOPLE WOULD STOP LIVES WILL BE SAVED THAT 'S WHAT I 'D HEARD AND I 'D HEARD THAT
JeremyGilley_2011G@574.46:577.15 FROM THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT CONFLICT WAS ABOUT
JeremyGilley_2011G@577.15:586.76 AND SO I WENT BACK TO THE UNITED NATIONS I DECIDED THAT I 'D CONTINUE FILMING AND MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE AND I WENT BACK TO THE U N FOR ANOTHER COUPLE OF YEARS WE STARTED MOVING AROUND THE CORRIDORS OF THE U N SYSTEM GOVERNMENTS
JeremyGilley_2011G@601.67:606.33 GOD BLESS THEM THEY SAID OKAY WE 'LL HAVE A GO AND THEN UNAMA BECAME INVOLVED IN AFGHANISTAN
JeremyGilley_2011G@622.6:626.78 AND SO I WENT BACK TO LONDON AND I WENT AND SAW THIS CHAP JUDE LAW
JeremyGilley_2011G@626.78:632.56 AND I SAW HIM BECAUSE HE WAS AN ACTOR I WAS AN ACTOR I HAD A CONNECTION TO HIM BECAUSE WE NEEDED TO GET TO THE PRESS WE NEEDED THIS ATTRACTION
JeremyGilley_2011G@632.56:637.63 WE NEEDED THE MEDIA TO BE INVOLVED BECAUSE IF WE START PUMPING IT UP A BIT MAYBE MORE PEOPLE WOULD LISTEN AND
JeremyGilley_2011G@660.65:668.69 YOU WANT TO COME WITH ME IT 'D BE REALLY INTERESTING IF YOU CAME IT WOULD HELP AND BRING ATTENTION AND THAT ATTENTION WOULD HELP LEVERAGE THE SITUATION
JeremyGilley_2011G@687.57:689.49 AND WE FOUND OURSELVES IN AFGHANISTAN
JeremyGilley_2011G@689.49:706.96 IT WAS A REALLY INCREDIBLE THING THAT WHEN WE LANDED THERE I WAS TALKING TO VARIOUS PEOPLE AND THEY WERE SAYING TO ME YOU 'VE GOT TO GET EVERYBODY INVOLVED HERE YOU CAN 'T JUST EXPECT IT TO WORK YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND WORK AND WE DID AND WE TRAVELED AROUND AND WE SPOKE TO ELDERS WE SPOKE TO DOCTORS WE SPOKE TO NURSES
JeremyGilley_2011G@706.96:718.58 WE HELD PRESS CONFERENCES WE WENT OUT WITH SOLDIERS WE SAT DOWN WITH ISAF WE SAT DOWN WITH NATO WE SAT DOWN WITH THE U K GOVERNMENT I MEAN WE BASICALLY SAT DOWN WITH EVERYBODY IN AND OUT OF SCHOOLS WITH MINISTERS OF EDUCATION
JeremyGilley_2011G@727.23:739.03 ABSOLUTELY INSTRUMENTAL IN WHAT WENT ON AS SHE WAS THE SPOKESPERSON FOR THE RESISTANCE AGAINST THE RUSSIANS AND HER AFGHAN NETWORK WAS JUST ABSOLUTELY EVERYWHERE AND SHE WAS REALLY CRUCIAL IN GETTING THE MESSAGE IN
JeremyGilley_2011G@739.03:756.68 AND THEN WE WENT HOME WE 'D SORT OF DONE IT WE HAD TO WAIT NOW AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED AND I GOT HOME AND I REMEMBER ONE OF THE TEAM BRINGING IN A LETTER TO ME FROM THE TALIBAN AND THAT LETTER BASICALLY SAID WE 'LL OBSERVE THIS DAY WE WILL OBSERVE THIS DAY WE SEE IT AS A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY
JeremyGilley_2011G@756.68:776.04 AND WE WILL NOT ENGAGE WE 'RE NOT GOING TO ENGAGE AND THAT MEANT THAT HUMANITARIAN WORKERS WOULDN 'T BE KIDNAPPED OR KILLED AND THEN SUDDENLY I OBVIOUSLY KNEW AT THIS POINT THERE WAS A CHANCE AND DAYS LATER ONE POINT SIX MILLION CHILDREN WERE VACCINATED AGAINST POLIO AS A CONSEQUENCE OF EVERYBODY STOPPING
JeremyGilley_2011G@802.99:805.54 BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE IN AFGHANISTAN WERE THE HEROES
JeremyGilley_2011G@805.54:807.67 THEY WERE THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED
JeremyGilley_2011G@807.67:819.14 IN PEACE AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF IT ETC ETC AND THEY MADE IT REAL AND WE WANTED TO GO BACK AND SHOW THEM THE FILM AND SAY LOOK YOU GUYS MADE THIS POSSIBLE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE GAVE THE FILM OVER OBVIOUSLY
JeremyGilley_2011G@819.14:836.28 IT WAS SHOWN AND IT WAS AMAZING AND THEN THAT YEAR THAT YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THIS ISAF STATEMENT FROM KABUL AFGHANISTAN SEPTEMBER SEVENTEENTH GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL COMMANDER OF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN ANNOUNCED TODAY ISAF WILL NOT CONDUCT OFFENSIVE MILITARY OPERATIONS ON THE TWENTY FIRST OF SEPTEMBER
JeremyGilley_2011G@848.52:864.97 SEVENTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN VIOLENCE ON THIS DAY AT LEAST AND THAT COMPLETELY BLEW MY MIND ALMOST MORE THAN ANYTHING AND I REMEMBER BEING STUCK IN NEW YORK THIS TIME BECAUSE OF THE VOLCANO WHICH WAS OBVIOUSLY MUCH LESS HARMFUL AND I WAS THERE THINKING ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND I KEPT THINKING ABOUT THIS SEVENTY PERCENT
JeremyGilley_2011G@864.97:880.51 SEVENTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN VIOLENCE IN WHAT EVERYONE SAID WAS COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE AND YOU COULDN 'T DO AND THAT MADE ME THINK THAT IF WE CAN GET SEVENTY PERCENT IN AFGHANISTAN THEN SURELY WE CAN GET SEVENTY PERCENT REDUCTION EVERYWHERE WE HAVE TO GO FOR A GLOBAL TRUCE
JeremyGilley_2011G@880.51:892.32 WE HAVE TO UTILIZE THIS DAY OF CEASEFIRE AND NONVIOLENCE AND GO FOR A GLOBAL TRUCE GO FOR THE LARGEST RECORDED CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY EVER RECORDED THAT 'S EXACTLY WHAT WE MUST DO
JeremyGilley_2011G@892.32:911.37 AND ON THE TWENTY FIRST OF SEPTEMBER THIS YEAR WE 'RE GOING TO LAUNCH THAT CAMPAIGN AT THE O TWO ARENA TO GO FOR THAT PROCESS TO TRY AND CREATE THE LARGEST RECORDED CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND WE WILL UTILIZE ALL KINDS OF THINGS HAVE A DANCE AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND VISITING ON FACEBOOK AND VISIT THE WEBSITE SIGN THE PETITION AND IT 'S IN THE SIX OFFICIAL LANGUAGES OF THE UNITED NATIONS
JeremyGilley_2011G@911.37:915.7 AND WE 'LL GLOBALLY LINK WITH GOVERNMENT INTER GOVERNMENT NON GOVERNMENT EDUCATION UNIONS SPORTS

JeremyGilley_2011G@953.55:956.29 AND ULTIMATELY WE HAVE TO TRY THAT WE HAVE
JeremyGilley_2011G@972.36:986.11 BROUGHT ABOUT BY INDIVIDUALS I WAS WITH BRAHIMI AMBASSADOR BRAHIMI I THINK HE 'S ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE MEN IN RELATION TO INTERNATIONAL POLITICS IN AFGHANISTAN IN IRAQ HE 'S AN AMAZING MAN AND I SAT WITH HIM A FEW WEEKS AGO AND I SAID TO HIM MR BRAHIMI IS THIS NUTS
JeremyGilley_2011G@992.39:995.99 I SAID WHAT WOULD YOU DO WOULD YOU GO TO GOVERNMENTS AND LOBBY AND USE THE SYSTEM HE SAID NO
JeremyGilley_2011G@995.99:1005.09 I 'D TALK TO THE INDIVIDUALS IT 'S ALL ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS IT 'S ALL ABOUT YOU AND ME IT 'S ALL ABOUT PARTNERSHIPS IT 'S ABOUT YOUR CONSTITUENCIES IT 'S ABOUT YOUR BUSINESSES
JeremyGilley_2011G@1025.38:1030.92 AND IT THEN MADE ME THINK ABOUT A GLASS OF WATER WHICH IS CLEAR IF YOU PUT ONE DROP
JeremyGilley_2011G@1030.92:1038.89 ONE DROP OF SOMETHING IN THAT WATER IT 'LL CHANGE IT FOREVER BY WORKING TOGETHER WE CAN CREATE PEACE ONE DAY THANK YOU TED
