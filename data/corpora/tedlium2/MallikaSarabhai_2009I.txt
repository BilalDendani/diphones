MallikaSarabhai_2009I THE ONE EYED MONKEY RECOGNIZED THE WOMAN A SEKHRI SHE WAS THE WIFE OF AN EVEN MORE FAMOUS BRAHMIN
MallikaSarabhai_2009I WATCH HER BETTER THE ONE EYED MONKEY CLIMBED ONTO THE TREE JUST THEN WITH A LOUD BANG THE HEAVENS OPENED AND THE GOD INDRA JUMPED INTO THE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I SAW THE WOMAN A SEKHRI AH HAH THE WOMAN PAID HIM NO HEED SO INDRA ATTRACTED THREW HER ONTO THE FLOOR AND PROCEEDED TO
MallikaSarabhai_2009I HE REALIZED AT ONCE WHAT HAD HAPPENED SO HE PETITIONED THE HIGHER GODS SO THAT HE MAY HAVE JUSTICE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I SO THE GOD VISHNU ARRIVED ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES JUST A ONE EYED MONKEY SAID THE BRAHMIN NOW THE ONE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I REALLY WANTED FOR THE WOMAN A SEKHRI TO GET JUSTICE SO SHE RETOLD EVENTS EXACTLY AS
MallikaSarabhai_2009I THEY
MallikaSarabhai_2009I THE GOD INDRA HAS SINNED IN THAT HE HAS SINNED AGAINST
MallikaSarabhai_2009I TO WASH AWAY HIS SINS SO INDRA ARRIVED AND PERFORMED THE SACRIFICE OF THE HORSE AND SO IT TRANSPIRED THAT A HORSE WAS KILLED
MallikaSarabhai_2009I A GOD WAS MAD SIN FREE A BRAHMIN 'S EGO WAS APPEASED A WOMAN
MallikaSarabhai_2009I WAS RUINED AND A ONE EYED MONKEY WAS LEFT
MallikaSarabhai_2009I VERY CONFUSED AT WHAT WE HUMANS CALL JUSTICE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I IN INDIA THERE IS A RAPE EVERY THREE MINUTES IN INDIA ONLY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF RAPES
MallikaSarabhai_2009I COME TO A POLICE STATION AND OF THESE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT THAT COME TO A POLICE STATION
MallikaSarabhai_2009I ONLY IN FOUR PERCENT OF THE CASES THAT'S A LOT OF WOMEN WHO DON'T GET JUSTICE AND IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT WOMEN
MallikaSarabhai_2009I LOOK AROUND YOU LOOK AT YOUR OWN COUNTRIES THERE IS A CERTAIN PATTERN IN WHO GETS CHARGED WITH CRIMES
MallikaSarabhai_2009I IF YOU'RE IN AUSTRALIA IT'S MOSTLY ABORIGINALS WHO ARE IN JAIL IF YOU'RE IN INDIA IT'S EITHER MUSLIMS OR ADIVASIS OUR TRIBALS THE NAXALITES IF YOU'RE IN THE U S IT'S MOSTLY THE BLACKS
MallikaSarabhai_2009I IS A TREND HERE AND THE BRAHMINS AND THE GODS LIKE IN MY STORY ALWAYS GET TO TELL THEIR TRUTH AS THE TRUTH
MallikaSarabhai_2009I SO HAVE WE ALL BECOME ONE EYED TWO EYED INSTEAD OF ONE EYED MONKEYS HAVE WE STOPPED SEEING INJUSTICE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I I HAVE TOLD THIS STORY CLOSE TO FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TIMES IN AUDIENCES IN FORTY COUNTRIES TO SCHOOL STUDENTS TO
MallikaSarabhai_2009I BLACK TIE DINNERS AT THE SMITHSONIAN AND SO ON AND SO FORTH AND EVERY TIME IT HITS SOMETHING NOW IF I WERE TO GO INTO THE SAME CROWD AND SAY I WANT TO LECTURE YOU ABOUT JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE THEY WOULD SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE OTHER THINGS TO DO AND THAT IS THE ASTONISHING POWER OF
MallikaSarabhai_2009I CAN GO THROUGH WERE OTHER THINGS CAN 'T YOU CAN'T HAVE BARRIERS BECAUSE IT BREAKS THROUGH YOUR PREJUDICES BREAKS THROUGH
MallikaSarabhai_2009I AND IN A WORLD WHERE ATTITUDES ARE SO DIFFICULT TO CHANGE WE NEED A LANGUAGE THAT REACHES THROUGH
MallikaSarabhai_2009I HITLER KNEW IT HE USED WAGNER TO MAKE ALL THE NAZIS FEEL WONDERFUL AND ARYAN AND MISTER BERLUSCONI KNOWS IT AS HE SITS ATOP THIS HUGE EMPIRE OF MEDIA AND TELEVISION AND SO ON AND SO
MallikaSarabhai_2009I AND ALL OF THE WONDERFUL CREATIVE MINDS IN ALL THE ADVERTISING AGENCIES AND WHO HELP CORPORATE SELL US THINGS WE ABSOLUTELY DON'T REQUIRE THEY ALSO KNOW THE POWER OF THE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I FOR ME IT CAME VERY EARLY WHEN I WAS A YOUNG CHILD MY MOTHER WHO WAS A CHOREOGRAPHER CAME UPON A PHENOMENON THAT WORRIED HER
MallikaSarabhai_2009I IT WAS A PHENOMENON WHERE YOUNG BRIDES WERE COMMITTING SUICIDE IN RURAL GUJARAT BECAUSE THEY WERE FORCED TO BRING MORE AND MORE MONEY FOR THEIR IN LAWS FAMILIES AND SHE CREATED A DANCE PIECE WHICH THEN PRIME MINISTER NEHRU SAW
MallikaSarabhai_2009I HE CAME TO TALK TO HER AND SAID WHAT IS THIS ABOUT SHE TOLD HIM AND HE SET OUT THE FIRST INQUIRY INTO WHAT TODAY WE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I FAT BLACK MAMAS IN THE BRONX USED TO COME AND SAY HEY GIRL THAT'S IT AND THEN THESE TRENDY YOUNG THINGS IN THE SORBONNE WOULD
MallikaSarabhai_2009I THIS IS WHAT
MallikaSarabhai_2009I THEY GET CHOLERA THEY GET DIARRHEA THEY GET JAUNDICE AND THEY DIE AND GOVERNMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE CLEAN WATER
MallikaSarabhai_2009I THEY TRY AND BUILD IT THEY TRY AND BUILD PIPELINES IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND THE MNCS GIVE THEM MACHINES THAT THEY CAN NOT AFFORD SO WHAT DO YOU DO DO YOU LET THEM DIE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I MOST HOUSES IN ASIA AND INDIA HAVE A COTTON GARMENT AND IT WAS DISCOVERED AND WHO ENDORSES THIS THAT A CLEAN COTTON GARMENT FOLDED EIGHT TIMES OVER
MallikaSarabhai_2009I CAN REDUCE BACTERIA UP TO EIGHTY PERCENT FROM WATER SIFT THROUGH SO WHY AREN'T GOVERNMENTS BLARING THIS ON TELEVISION WHY ISN'T IT ON EVERY POSTER ACROSS THE THIRD
MallikaSarabhai_2009I I
MallikaSarabhai_2009I HERE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I THE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I THE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I AND
MallikaSarabhai_2009I I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT ALL OF US HERE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ESCALATING VIOLENCE IN OUR DAILY LIVES WHILE UNIVERSITIES ARE TRYING TO DEVISE COURSES IN CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND GOVERNMENTS ARE TRYING TO STOP SKIRMISHES AT
MallikaSarabhai_2009I WE ARE SURROUNDED BY VIOLENCE WHETHER IT'S ROAD RAGE OR WHETHER IT'S DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHETHER IT'S A TEACHER BEATING UP A STUDENT AND KILLING HER BECAUSE SHE HASN'T DONE HER HOMEWORK IT'S
MallikaSarabhai_2009I SO WHY ARE WE NOT DOING SOMETHING TO ACTUALLY ATTEND THAT PROBLEM ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS WHAT ARE WE DOING TO TRY AND MAKE CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE REALIZE THAT VIOLENCE IS SOMETHING THAT WE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I IN THAT WE CAN STOP AND THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF ACTUALLY TAKING VIOLENCE TAKING ANGER TAKING FRUSTRATIONS INTO DIFFERENT THINGS THAT DO NOT HARM OTHER PEOPLE WELL HERE IS ONE SUCH WAY
MallikaSarabhai_2009I YOU ARE PEACEFUL PEOPLE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I WERE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I GENE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I AND
MallikaSarabhai_2009I YOU
MallikaSarabhai_2009I THAT
MallikaSarabhai_2009I GANGS FROM THIS NEIGHBORHOOD KILLING GANGS FROM
MallikaSarabhai_2009I SPAWNED THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WANTING TO VOLUNTEER FOR SOCIAL CHANGE IN VENEZUELA ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SOAP OPERAS HAS A HEROINE CALLED CRYSTAL AND WHEN ONSCREEN CRYSTAL GOT BREAST CANCER
MallikaSarabhai_2009I SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND MORE YOUNG WOMEN WENT TO HAVE MAMMOGRAPHIES DONE AND OF COURSE THE VAGINA MONOLOGUES WE KNOW ABOUT AND THERE ARE STAND UP COMICS WHO ARE TALKING ABOUT RACIAL ISSUES ABOUT ETHNIC ISSUES
MallikaSarabhai_2009I SO WHY IS IT THAT IF WE THINK THAT WE ALL AGREE THAT WE NEED A BETTER WORLD
MallikaSarabhai_2009I WE NEED A MORE JUST WORLD WHY IS IT THAT WE ARE NOT USING THE ONE LANGUAGE THAT HAS CONSISTENTLY SHOWED US THAT WE CAN BREAK DOWN BARRIERS THAT WE CAN REACH PEOPLE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I WHAT I NEED TO SAY TO THE PLANNERS OF THE WORLD THE GOVERNMENTS THE STRATEGISTS IS YOU HAVE TREATED THE ARTS AS THE CHERRY ON THE CAKE IT NEEDS TO BE THE YEAST
MallikaSarabhai_2009I BECAUSE ANY FUTURE PLANNING IF TWO THOUSAND AND FORTY EIGHT IS WHEN WE WANT TO GET THERE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I UNLESS THE ARTS ARE PUT WITH THE SCIENTISTS WITH THE ECONOMISTS WITH ALL THOSE WHO PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE BADLY
MallikaSarabhai_2009I WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THERE AND UNLESS THIS IS ACTUALLY INTERNALIZED IT WON 'T HAPPEN SO WHAT IS IT THAT WE REQUIRE WHAT IS IT THAT WE NEED
MallikaSarabhai_2009I WE NEED TO BREAK DOWN OUR VISION OF WHAT PLANNERS ARE OF WHAT THE CORRECT WAY OF A PATH IS AND TO SAY ALL THESE YEARS OF
MallikaSarabhai_2009I SIMPLE THINGS SO SOMETHING HAS GOT TO GIVE AND THAT IS WHAT I WANT CAN I HAVE MY LAST AUDIO TRACK PLEASE
MallikaSarabhai_2009I ONCE THERE WAS A PRINCESS WHO WHISTLED BEAUTIFULLY
