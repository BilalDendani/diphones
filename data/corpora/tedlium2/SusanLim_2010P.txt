SusanLim_2010P I WAS PRIVILEGED TO TRAIN IN TRANSPLANTATION UNDER TWO GREAT SURGICAL PIONEERS
SusanLim_2010P WHO PERFORMED THE FIRST LIVER TRANSPLANT IN THE U K IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR
SusanLim_2010P AGAINST ALL ODDS
SusanLim_2010P NEXT RAISING THE MONEY
SusanLim_2010P PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT I AM
SusanLim_2010P BUT NOT ALL PATIENTS ON THE TRANSPLANT WAIT LIST ARE SO FORTUNATE
SusanLim_2010P THE TRUTH IS THERE ARE JUST SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH DONOR ORGANS TO GO AROUND AS THE DEMAND FOR DONOR ORGANS CONTINUES TO RISE IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE AGING POPULATION THE SUPPLY HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSTANT
SusanLim_2010P IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND
SusanLim_2010P AND THE GIFT OF LIFE HAS BEEN EXTENDED
SusanLim_2010P TO A RELATIVE OR LOVED ONE
SusanLim_2010P BUT AS THERE WAS STILL A DIRE SHORTAGE OF DONOR ORGANS THE GIFT OF LIFE WAS THEN EXTENDED FROM LIVING RELATED DONORS TO NOW LIVING UNRELATED DONORS AND THIS THEN HAS GIVEN RISE
SusanLim_2010P AND UNEXPECTED MORAL CONTROVERSY
SusanLim_2010P HOW CAN
SusanLim_2010P FROM ONE THAT IS FORCED OR COERCED FROM FOR EXAMPLE
SusanLim_2010P A SUBMISSIVE SPOUSE AN IN LAW
SusanLim_2010P A SERVANT A SLAVE AN EMPLOYEE
SusanLim_2010P IN MY PART OF THE WORLD
SusanLim_2010P AND IN SOME AREAS
SusanLim_2010P SHORTLY AFTER I PERFORMED THE FIRST LIVER TRANSPLANT I RECEIVED MY NEXT ASSIGNMENT AND THAT WAS
SusanLim_2010P TO GO TO THE PRISONS TO HARVEST ORGANS FROM EXECUTED PRISONERS
SusanLim_2010P I WAS ALSO PREGNANT AT THE TIME PREGNANCIES ARE MEANT TO BE HAPPY AND FULFILLING MOMENTS IN ANY WOMAN 'S LIFE
SusanLim_2010P BUT MY JOYFUL PERIOD
SusanLim_2010P THOUGHTS OF WALKING THROUGH
SusanLim_2010P THE PRISON 'S HIGH SECURITY DEATH ROW
SusanLim_2010P AS THIS WAS THE ONLY ROUTE TO TAKE ME TO THE MAKESHIFT OPERATING ROOM
SusanLim_2010P AND AT EACH TIME
SusanLim_2010P AND FOR TWO YEARS I STRUGGLED WITH THE DILEMMA OF WAKING UP AT FOUR THIRTY AM ON A FRIDAY MORNING
SusanLim_2010P READY TO RECEIVE THE BODY OF AN EXECUTED PRISONER REMOVE THE ORGANS AND THEN TRANSPORT THESE ORGANS
SusanLim_2010P TO THE RECIPIENT HOSPITAL
SusanLim_2010P NO DOUBT I WAS INFORMED
SusanLim_2010P AT ENGRAFTING THE GIFT OF LIFE
SusanLim_2010P BUT REALLY NONE OF US REMAINED THE SAME I WAS TROUBLED
SusanLim_2010P THAT THE RETRIEVAL OF ORGANS FROM EXECUTED PRISONERS WAS AT LEAST AS MORALLY CONTROVERSIAL
SusanLim_2010P AS THE HARVESTING OF STEM CELLS FROM HUMAN EMBRYOS
SusanLim_2010P FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NO INFLUENCE
SusanLim_2010P IT MADE ME WONDER
SusanLim_2010P IF THERE COULD BE A BETTER WAY A WAY TO CIRCUMVENT DEATH
SusanLim_2010P AND YET DELIVER THE GIFT OF LIFE
SusanLim_2010P FROM WIDE OPEN INCISIONS TO KEYHOLE PROCEDURES TINY INCISIONS
SusanLim_2010P AND IN TRANSPLANTATION CONCEPTS SHIFTED FROM WHOLE ORGANS TO CELLS
SusanLim_2010P IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA
SusanLim_2010P I PARTICIPATED IN A SMALL SERIES OF WHOLE ORGAN PANCREAS TRANSPLANTS I WITNESSED THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY
SusanLim_2010P AND THIS INSPIRED IN MY MIND
SusanLim_2010P I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WHY NOT TAKE
SusanLim_2010P THE INDIVIDUAL CELLS OUT OF THE PANCREAS THE CELLS THAT SECRETE INSULIN TO CURE DIABETES AND TRANSPLANT THESE CELLS TECHNICALLY A MUCH SIMPLER PROCEDURE THAN HAVING TO GRAPPLE WITH THE COMPLEXITIES OF TRANSPLANTING
SusanLim_2010P PANCREATIC ISLET CELLS CAPTURED THE ATTENTION OF THE MEDIA
SusanLim_2010P AND THE IMAGINATION OF THE PUBLIC
SusanLim_2010P I TOO WAS FASCINATED BY THIS NEW AND DISRUPTIVE CELL TECHNOLOGY
SusanLim_2010P AND THIS INSPIRED A SHIFT IN MY MINDSET
SusanLim_2010P FROM TRANSPLANTING WHOLE ORGANS TO TRANSPLANTING CELLS
SusanLim_2010P AND I FOCUSED MY RESEARCH
SusanLim_2010P STEM CELLS AS A POSSIBLE SOURCE FOR CELL TRANSPLANTS
SusanLim_2010P TODAY WE REALIZE THAT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF STEM CELLS
SusanLim_2010P EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS HAVE OCCUPIED CENTER STAGE CHIEFLY BECAUSE OF THEIR PLURIPOTENCY THAT IS THEIR EASE IN DIFFERENTIATING INTO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CELL TYPES
SusanLim_2010P INSPIRED
SusanLim_2010P YOU AND I I THINK WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO GET RID OF ANYWAY
SusanLim_2010P FAT IS ONE OF THE BEST SOURCES OF ADULT STEM CELLS BUT ADULT STEM CELLS ARE NOT EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS
SusanLim_2010P AND HERE IS THE LIMITATION ADULT STEM CELLS ARE MATURE CELLS
SusanLim_2010P AND LIKE MATURE HUMAN BEINGS THESE CELLS
SusanLim_2010P AGING ADULT CELLS FROM YOU AND ME THEY ARE RACING TO REPROGRAM THESE CELLS BACK INTO MORE USEFUL
SusanLim_2010P WE ARE FOCUSED ON TAKING FAT
SusanLim_2010P AND REPROGRAMMING MOUNDS OF FAT
SusanLim_2010P INTO FOUNTAINS OF YOUTHFUL CELLS
SusanLim_2010P IF THIS RESEARCH IS SUCCESSFUL
SusanLim_2010P IT MAY THEN REDUCE THE NEED
SusanLim_2010P TO RESEARCH AND SACRIFICE HUMAN EMBRYOS
SusanLim_2010P INDEED THERE IS A LOT OF HYPE BUT ALSO HOPE
SusanLim_2010P HEART DISEASE STROKE DIABETES SPINAL CORD INJURY MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY RETINAL EYE DISEASES
SusanLim_2010P ARE ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS RELEVANT PERSONALLY TO YOU
SusanLim_2010P IN MAY TWO THOUSAND AND SIX SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAPPENED TO ME I WAS ABOUT TO START A ROBOTIC OPERATION
SusanLim_2010P BUT STEPPING OUT OF THE ELEVATOR INTO THE BRIGHT AND GLARING LIGHTS OF THE OPERATING ROOM I REALIZED THAT MY LEFT
SusanLim_2010P I HAD TAKEN A RATHER HARD KNOCK DURING LATE SPRING SKIING YES I FELL
SusanLim_2010P AND I STARTED TO SEE FLOATERS AND STARS WHICH I CASUALLY DISMISSED AS TOO MUCH HIGH ALTITUDE SUN EXPOSURE
SusanLim_2010P BUT NOT BEFORE A PROLONGED PERIOD OF CONVALESCENCE THREE MONTHS IN A HEAD DOWN POSITION THIS EXPERIENCE TAUGHT ME TO EMPATHIZE MORE WITH MY PATIENTS AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH RETINAL DISEASES
SusanLim_2010P THIRTY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE
SusanLim_2010P OR PART VISION TO MILLIONS OF PATIENTS WITH RETINAL DISEASES WORLDWIDE
SusanLim_2010P IT IS A FACT
SusanLim_2010P THAT WHEN OUR ORGANS OR TISSUES ARE INJURED
SusanLim_2010P STEM CELLS MAY BE USED AS BUILDING BLOCKS TO REPAIR DAMAGED SCAFFOLDS WITHIN OUR BODY
SusanLim_2010P OR TO PROVIDE NEW LIVER CELLS TO REPAIR DAMAGED LIVER
SusanLim_2010P YEARLY FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION SUFFER
SusanLim_2010P STEM CELLS MAY ONE DAY HERALD
SusanLim_2010P A QUANTUM LEAP IN THE FIELD OF CARDIOLOGY
SusanLim_2010P STEM CELLS PROVIDE HOPE
SusanLim_2010P FOR NEW BEGINNINGS SMALL INCREMENTAL STEPS CELLS RATHER THAN ORGANS REPAIR
SusanLim_2010P RATHER THAN REPLACEMENT
SusanLim_2010P STEM CELL THERAPIES
SusanLim_2010P MAY ONE DAY REDUCE THE NEED
SusanLim_2010P AND IN THE U K NEURAL STEM CELLS TO TREAT STROKE
SusanLim_2010P THE RESEARCH SUCCESS THAT WE CELEBRATE TODAY
SusanLim_2010P HAS BEEN MADE POSSIBLE
SusanLim_2010P BY THE CURIOSITY AND CONTRIBUTION AND COMMITMENT OF INDIVIDUAL SCIENTISTS AND MEDICAL PIONEERS EACH ONE HAS HIS STORY
SusanLim_2010P A JOURNEY THROUGH CONTROVERSY INSPIRED
