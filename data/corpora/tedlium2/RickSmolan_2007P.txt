RickSmolan_2007P I SPENT A FEW DAYS PHOTOGRAPHING CHILDREN IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND LIKE A LOT OF PHOTOGRAPHERS AND A LOT OF JOURNALISTS I ALWAYS HOPE THAT WHEN MY PICTURES WERE PUBLISHED
RickSmolan_2007P THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE AN EFFECT ON A SITUATION INSTEAD OF JUST DOCUMENTING IT SO I
RickSmolan_2007P I DECIDED I WOULD FIND SIX CHILDREN IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND ACTUALLY GO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THE KIDS AND TRY TO TELL THEIR STORY A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN I THOUGHT I HAD DONE FOR TIME MAGAZINE IN THE COURSE OF DOING THE STORY I WAS LOOKING FOR
RickSmolan_2007P IN KOREA THAT THERE WAS A YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD BEING RAISED BY HER GRANDMOTHER AND THE GRANDMOTHER HAD NEVER LET ANY WESTERNERS EVER SEE HER EVERY TIME ANY WESTERNERS CAME TO THE VILLAGE SHE HID THE
RickSmolan_2007P WITH ME AND WENT TO THIS VILLAGE FOUND THE GRANDMOTHER SAT DOWN WITH HER AND TO MY ASTONISHMENT SHE AGREED TO LET ME PHOTOGRAPH HER GRANDDAUGHTER AND I WAS PAYING FOR THIS MYSELF SO I ASKED THE TRANSLATOR
RickSmolan_2007P IT WOULD BE OK IF I STAYED FOR THE WEEK I HAD A SLEEPING BAG THE FAMILY HAD A SMALL SHED ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE SO I SAID COULD I SLEEP IN MY SLEEPING BAG IN THE EVENINGS AND
RickSmolan_2007P I JUST TOLD THE LITTLE GIRL WHOSE NAME WAS HYUN SOOK LEE THAT IF I EVER DID ANYTHING TO EMBARRASS HER SHE DIDN'T SPEAK A WORD OF ENGLISH ALTHOUGH SHE LOOKED VERY AMERICAN
RickSmolan_2007P SHE COULD JUST PUT UP HER HAND AND SAY STOP AND I WOULD STOP TAKING PICTURES AND THEN MY TRANSLATOR LEFT SO THERE I WAS I COULDN'T SPEAK A WORD OF KOREAN AND THIS IS THE FIRST NIGHT
RickSmolan_2007P HER MOTHER WAS STILL ALIVE HER MOTHER WAS NOT RAISING HER HER GRANDMOTHER WAS RAISING HER AND WHAT STRUCK ME IMMEDIATELY
RickSmolan_2007P WAS HOW IN LOVE THE TWO OF THESE PEOPLE WERE THE GRANDMOTHER WAS INCREDIBLY FOND DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH THIS
RickSmolan_2007P THEY SLEPT ON THE FLOOR AT NIGHT THE WAY THEY HEAT THEIR HOMES IN KOREA IS TO PUT BRICKS UNDER THE FLOORS SO THE HEAT ACTUALLY RADIATES FROM UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR HYUN SOOK WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD I HAD PHOTOGRAPHED AS I SAID A LOT OF THESE KIDS
RickSmolan_2007P WAS IN FACT THE FIFTH CHILD THAT I FOUND TO PHOTOGRAPH AND ALMOST UNIVERSALLY AMONGST ALL THE KIDS THEY WERE REALLY PSYCHOLOGICALLY
RickSmolan_2007P BY HAVING BEEN MADE FUN OF RIDICULED PICKED ON AND BEEN REJECTED AND KOREA WAS PROBABLY THE PLACE I FOUND TO BE THE WORST FOR THESE KIDS AND WHAT STRUCK ME IMMEDIATELY IN
RickSmolan_2007P YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH SHE LOOKS LIKE HER GRANDMOTHER ALTHOUGH SHE LOOKS SO WESTERN I DECIDED TO FOLLOW HER TO SCHOOL THIS IS THE FIRST MORNING I STAYED WITH HER THIS IS ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL
RickSmolan_2007P THIS IS THE MORNING ASSEMBLY OUTSIDE HER SCHOOL
RickSmolan_2007P AND I NOTICED THAT SHE WAS CLOWNING AROUND WHEN THE TEACHERS WOULD ASK QUESTIONS SHE'D BE THE FIRST PERSON TO RAISE HER HAND
RickSmolan_2007P AGAIN NOT AT ALL SHY OR WITHDRAWN OR ANYTHING LIKE THE OTHER CHILDREN THAT I'D PHOTOGRAPHED AGAIN THE FIRST ONE TO GO TO THE BLACKBOARD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
RickSmolan_2007P GETTING IN TROUBLE FOR WHISPERING INTO HER BEST FRIENDS EARS IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS AND ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT I SAID TO HER THROUGH THE TRANSLATOR AGAIN THIS THING ABOUT SAYING STOP
RickSmolan_2007P WAS TO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO ME AND SO SHE REALLY JUST COMPLETELY IGNORED ME MOST OF THE TIME I NOTICED THAT AT RECESS SHE WAS THE GIRL WHO PICKED THE OTHER GIRLS TO BE ON HER TEAM
RickSmolan_2007P WAS VERY OBVIOUS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THAT SHE WAS A LEADER THIS IS ON THE WAY HOME AND THAT'S NORTH KOREA UP ALONG THE HILL THIS IS UP ALONG THE DMZ THEY WOULD ACTUALLY COVER THE WINDOWS EVERY NIGHT
RickSmolan_2007P SO THAT LIGHT COULDN'T BE SEEN BECAUSE THE SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT HAS SAID FOR YEARS THAT THE NORTH KOREANS MAY INVADE AT ANY TIME SO THERE'S ALWAYS THIS THE CLOSER YOU
RickSmolan_2007P THE WEEK CAME AND MY TRANSLATOR CAME BACK BECAUSE I'D ASKED HER TO COME BACK SO I COULD FORMALLY THANK THE GRANDMOTHER AND HYUN SOOK AND IN THE COURSE OF THE GRANDMOTHER TALKING TO THE TRANSLATOR THE GRANDMOTHER STARTED CRYING
RickSmolan_2007P AND I SAID TO MY TRANSLATOR WHAT 'S GOING ON WHY IS SHE CRYING AND SHE SPOKE TO THE GRANDMOTHER FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SHE STARTED GETTING TEARS IN HER EYES AND I SAID OK WHAT DID I DO WHAT'S GOING ON WHY IS EVERYONE CRYING AND THE TRANSLATOR SAID THE GRANDMOTHER SAYS THAT SHE THINKS SHE'S DYING
RickSmolan_2007P AND SHE WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU WOULD TAKE HYUN SOOK TO AMERICA WITH YOU AND I SAID I 'M TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD AND I LIVE IN HOTELS AND
RickSmolan_2007P I'M NOT MARRIED I MEAN I HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THIS GIRL BUT I YOU KNOW IT WAS LIKE EMOTIONALLY I WAS ABOUT TWELVE YEARS OLD IF YOU KNOW OF PHOTOGRAPHERS
RickSmolan_2007P THE JOKE IS IT'S THE FINEST FORM OF DELAYED ADOLESCENCE EVER INVENTED SORRY I HAVE TO GO ON AN ASSIGNMENT I'LL BE BACK AND THEN YOU NEVER COME BACK SO I
RickSmolan_2007P ASKED THE TRANSLATOR WHY SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS DYING CAN I GET HER TO A HOSPITAL COULD I PAY TO GET HER A DOCTOR AND SHE REFUSED ANY HELP AT ALL
RickSmolan_2007P MY BEST FRIEND HAD MISTAKENLY ONE DAY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT WISHING HE HAD ANOTHER CHILD SO HERE MY FRIENDS GENE AND GAIL HAD NOT HEARD FROM ME IN ABOUT A YEAR
RickSmolan_2007P AND SUDDENLY I WAS CALLING SAYING I 'M IN KOREA AND I'VE MET THIS EXTRAORDINARY GIRL AND I SAID THE GRANDMOTHER THINKS SHE'S SICK BUT I THINK MAYBE WE
RickSmolan_2007P HAVE TO BRING THE GRANDMOTHER OVER ALSO AND I SAID I 'LL PAY FOR THE I MEAN I HAD THIS WHOLE SORT OF PICTURE SO ANYWAY I LEFT AND
RickSmolan_2007P MY FRIENDS ACTUALLY SAID THEY WERE VERY INTERESTED IN ADOPTING HER AND I SAID LOOK I THINK I'LL SCARE THE GRANDMOTHER TO DEATH IF I ACTUALLY
RickSmolan_2007P BACK AND TALK TO HER BUT I WAS OFF ON ASSIGNMENT I FIGURED I'D COME BACK IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND TALK TO THE GRANDMOTHER AND ON CHRISTMAS DAY I WAS IN BANGKOK WITH A GROUP OF PHOTOGRAPHERS AND GOT A TELEGRAM BACK IN THOSE DAYS YOU GOT TELEGRAMS
RickSmolan_2007P FROM TIME MAGAZINE SAYING SOMEONE IN KOREA HAD DIED AND LEFT THEIR CHILD IN A WILL TO ME DID I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I HADN'T TOLD THEM WHAT I WAS DOING BECAUSE I WAS SO UPSET WITH THE STORY
RickSmolan_2007P SO I WENT BACK TO KOREA AND I WENT BACK TO HYUN SOOK 'S VILLAGE AND SHE WAS GONE AND THE HOUSE THAT I HAD SPENT TIME IN WAS EMPTY IT WAS INCREDIBLY COLD
RickSmolan_2007P HER BEST FRIEND THAT SHE USED TO PLAY WITH AFTER SCHOOL EVERY DAY AND MYUNG SUNG UNDER SOME PRESSURE FROM ME AND THE TRANSLATOR GAVE US AN ADDRESS ON THE OUTSIDE OF
RickSmolan_2007P AND I WENT TO THAT ADDRESS AND KNOCKED ON THE DOOR AND A MAN ANSWERED THE DOOR IT WAS NOT A VERY NICE AREA OF
RickSmolan_2007P SO I WAS
RickSmolan_2007P THE DOOR WAS BEING SLAMMED IN MY FACE IT'S INCREDIBLY COLD AND I'M TRYING TO THINK WHAT WOULD THE HERO DO IN A MOVIE IF I WAS WRITING THIS AS A MOVIE SCRIPT SO I SAID LISTEN IT'S REALLY COLD I'VE COME A VERY LONG WAY DO YOU MIND IF I JUST COME IN FOR A MINUTE I'M FREEZING
RickSmolan_2007P SO THE GUY KIND OF RELUCTANTLY LET US IN AND WE SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND AS WE STARTED TALKING I SAW HIM YELL SOMETHING AND HYUN SOOK CAME AND BROUGHT US SOME FOOD
RickSmolan_2007P AND I HAD THIS WHOLE MENTAL PICTURE OF SORT OF LIKE CINDERELLA I SORT OF HAD THIS PICTURE OF THIS INCREDIBLY WONDERFUL BRIGHT HAPPY LITTLE CHILD WHO NOW APPEARED TO BE VERY WITHDRAWN
RickSmolan_2007P BEING ENSLAVED BY THIS FAMILY AND I WAS REALLY APPALLED AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO AND THE MORE I TRIED TALKING TO HIM THE LESS FRIENDLY HE WAS GETTING SO I FINALLY DECIDED I SAID LOOK THIS IS ALL THROUGH THE TRANSLATOR BECAUSE THIS IS ALL YOU KNOW I DON'T SPEAK A WORD OF KOREAN
RickSmolan_2007P AND I SAID LOOK I'M REALLY GLAD THAT HYUN SOOK HAS A FAMILY TO LIVE WITH I WAS VERY WORRIED ABOUT HER I MADE A PROMISE TO HER GRANDMOTHER YOUR MOTHER
RickSmolan_2007P MOTHER HAD BEEN A PROSTITUTE AND SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE AND A BOY WHO 'D BEEN IN AND OUT OF JAIL AND I SAID TO THEM LOOK THERE'S A LITTLE GIRL WHO HAS A TINY CHANCE OF GETTING
RickSmolan_2007P OUT OF HERE AND GOING TO AMERICA I SAID I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE RIGHT DECISION OR NOT BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO COME TO LUNCH TOMORROW AND TELL THE UNCLE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WALK DOWN THE STREET WHAT PEOPLE SAY TO YOU WHAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING
RickSmolan_2007P AND JUST I WANT HIM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS IF SHE STAYS HERE AND I COULD BE WRONG I DON'T KNOW BUT I WISH YOU WOULD COME TOMORROW SO THESE TWO CAME TO LUNCH AND
RickSmolan_2007P WE GOT THROWN OUT OF THE RESTAURANT THEY WERE YELLING AT HIM THEY WERE IT GOT TO BE REALLY UGLY AND WE WENT OUTSIDE AND HE WAS JUST FURIOUS AND I KNEW I HAD TOTALLY BLOWN THIS WHOLE THING HERE I WAS AGAIN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO
RickSmolan_2007P WITH YOUR CAMERAS AROUND YOUR NECK ACCUSING ME OF ENSLAVING MY NIECE THIS IS MY NIECE I LOVE HER SHE'S
RickSmolan_2007P DAUGHTER WHO THE HELL ARE YOU TO ACCUSE ME OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND I SAID YOU KNOW LOOK I SAID
RickSmolan_2007P I WILL FLY MY FRIENDS OVER HERE FROM THE UNITED STATES IF YOU WANT TO MEET THEM TO SEE IF YOU APPROVE OF THEM I JUST THINK THAT WHAT LITTLE I KNOW ABOUT THE SITUATION SHE HAS VERY LITTLE CHANCE HERE OF HAVING THE KIND OF LIFE THAT YOU PROBABLY WOULD LIKE HER TO HAVE
RickSmolan_2007P SO EVERYONE TOLD ME AFTERWARDS THAT INVITING THE PROSPECTIVE PARENTS OVER WAS AGAIN THE STUPIDEST THING I COULD HAVE POSSIBLY DONE BECAUSE WHO 'S EVER GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOUR
RickSmolan_2007P BUT HE INVITED ME TO COME TO A CEREMONY THEY WERE HAVING THAT DAY FOR HER GRANDMOTHER AND THEY ACTUALLY TAKE ITEMS OF CLOTHING AND PHOTOGRAPHS AND THEY BURN THEM AS PART OF THE RITUAL
RickSmolan_2007P AND YOU CAN SEE HOW DIFFERENT SHE LOOKS JUST IN THREE MONTHS THIS WAS NOW I THINK FEBRUARY EARLY FEBRUARY AND THE PICTURES BEFORE WERE TAKEN IN SEPTEMBER
RickSmolan_2007P AN AMERICAN MARINE PRIEST THAT I HAD MET IN THE COURSE OF DOING THE STORY WHO HAD SEVENTY FIVE CHILDREN LIVING IN HIS HOUSE HE HAD THREE WOMEN HELPING HIM TAKE CARE OF THESE KIDS
RickSmolan_2007P FATHER KEENE HE 'S JUST A WONDERFUL GUY
RickSmolan_2007P KIDS
RickSmolan_2007P THIS IS A SOCIAL WORKER INTERVIEWING HYUN SOOK NOW I HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT SHE WAS COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED BY ALL OF THIS BECAUSE THE GRANDMOTHER TO ME APPEARED TO BE SORT OF THE VILLAGE WISE WOMAN AND THE
RickSmolan_2007P AND HE SAID THE SECOND DAY SHE WAS HERE SHE MADE UP A LIST OF ALL OF THE NAMES OF THE OLDER KIDS AND THE YOUNGER KIDS AND SHE ASSIGNED ONE OF THE OLDER KIDS TO EACH OF THE YOUNGER KIDS
RickSmolan_2007P AND THEN SHE SET UP A WORK DETAIL LIST OF WHO CLEANED THE ORPHANAGE ON WHAT DAY AND HE SAID SHE 'S TELLING ME THAT I'M MESSY AND I HAVE TO CLEAN UP MY ROOM AND HE SAID I DON'T KNOW WHO RAISED HER BUT HE SAID SHE 'S RUNNING THE ORPHANAGE AND SHE'S BEEN HERE THREE
RickSmolan_2007P THIS IS A WOMAN WHO IS NOW WORKING AT THE ORPHANAGE WHOSE SON HAD BEEN ADOPTED
RickSmolan_2007P GENE AND GAIL STARTED STUDYING KOREAN THE MOMENT THEY HAD GOTTEN MY FIRST LETTER THEY REALLY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO WELCOME HYUN SOOK INTO THEIR FAMILY
RickSmolan_2007P AND ONE OF THE THINGS FATHER KEENE TOLD ME WHEN I CAME BACK FROM ONE OF THESE TRIPS HYUN SOOK HAD CHOSEN THE NAME NATASHA
RickSmolan_2007P WHICH I UNDERSTOOD WAS FROM HER WATCHING A ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE CARTOON ON THE AMERICAN AIR FORCE STATION THIS MAY BE ONE OF THOSE MYTH BUSTER THINGS THAT WE'LL HAVE TO CLEAR UP HERE IN A MINUTE SO MY FRIEND GENE FLEW OVER WITH HIS SON TIM
RickSmolan_2007P GAIL COULDN'T COME AND THEY SPENT A LOT OF TIME HUDDLED OVER A DICTIONARY AND THIS WAS GENE SHOWING THE UNCLE WHERE ATLANTA WAS ON THE MAP WHERE HE LIVED
