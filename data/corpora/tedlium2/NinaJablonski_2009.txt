NinaJablonski_2009@16.88:27.39 INTERESTINGLY CHARLES DARWIN WAS BORN A VERY LIGHTLY PIGMENTED MAN IN A MODERATELY TO DARKLY PIGMENTED WORLD
NinaJablonski_2009@28.05:35.49 OVER THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE DARWIN HAD GREAT PRIVILEGE HE LIVED IN A FAIRLY WEALTHY HOME
NinaJablonski_2009@35.92:43.10 HE WAS RAISED BY VERY SUPPORTIVE AND INTERESTED PARENTS AND WHEN HE WAS IN HIS TWENTIES HE EMBARKED UPON A REMARKABLE
NinaJablonski_2009@43.44:54.45 VOYAGE ON THE SHIP THE BEAGLE AND DURING THE COURSE OF THAT VOYAGE HE SAW REMARKABLE THINGS TREMENDOUS DIVERSITY OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS AND HUMANS
NinaJablonski_2009@54.88:65.64 AND THE OBSERVATIONS THAT HE MADE ON THAT EPIC JOURNEY WERE TO BE EVENTUALLY DISTILLED INTO HIS WONDERFUL BOOK ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES PUBLISHED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO
NinaJablonski_2009@66.25:79.03 NOW WHAT IS SO INTERESTING AND TO SOME THE EXTENT WHAT'S A BIT INFAMOUS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES IS THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE LINE IN IT ABOUT HUMAN EVOLUTION
NinaJablonski_2009@79.58:87.99 LIGHT WILL BE THROWN ON THE ORIGIN OF MAN AND HIS HISTORY IT WASN'T UNTIL MUCH LONGER MUCH LATER
NinaJablonski_2009@88.33:95.42 THAT DARWIN ACTUALLY SPOKE AND WROTE ABOUT HUMANS NOW IN HIS YEARS OF
NinaJablonski_2009@105.28:115.22 WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE VARIED AND HE WAS SOMEWHAT INTERESTED IN THE PATTERN OF SKIN COLOR HE KNEW THAT DARKLY PIGMENTED
NinaJablonski_2009@135.52:142.55 HE SAID OF ALL THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RACES OF MEN THE COLOR OF THE SKIN IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS AND ONE OF THE BEST MARKED
NinaJablonski_2009@142.91:150.69 AND HE WENT ON TO SAY THESE DIFFERENCES DO NOT COINCIDE WITH CORRESPONDING DIFFERENCES IN CLIMATE
NinaJablonski_2009@151.09:165.09 SO HE HAD TRAVELED ALL AROUND HE HAD SEEN PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT COLORS LIVING IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND YET HE REJECTED THE IDEA THAT HUMAN SKIN PIGMENTATION WAS RELATED TO THE CLIMATE
NinaJablonski_2009@165.71:172.67 IF ONLY DARWIN LIVED TODAY IF ONLY DARWIN HAD NASA NOW
NinaJablonski_2009@173.07:180.49 ONE OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS THAT NASA DOES IS IT PUTS UP A VARIETY OF SATELLITES THAT DETECT ALL SORT OF INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENT
NinaJablonski_2009@180.92:189.55 AND FOR MANY DECADES NOW THERE HAVE BEEN A SERIES OF TOMS SATELLITES THAT COLLECTED DATA ABOUT THE RADIATION OF THE EARTH 'S SURFACE
NinaJablonski_2009@189.88:198.48 THE TOMS SEVEN SATELLITE DATA SHOWN HERE SHOW THE ANNUAL AVERAGE ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION AT THE EARTH 'S SURFACE
NinaJablonski_2009@198.90:206.89 NOW THE REALLY HOT PINK AND RED AREAS ARE THOSE PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT RECEIVE THE HIGHEST AMOUNTS OF UV DURING THE YEAR
NinaJablonski_2009@207.20:220.29 THE INCREMENTALLY COOLER COLORS BLUES GREENS YELLOWS AND FINALLY GRAYS INDICATE AREAS OF MUCH LOWER ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT TO THE STORY OF HUMAN SKIN PIGMENTATION
NinaJablonski_2009@220.97:233.05 JUST HOW MUCH OF THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE IS IN THESE COOL GRAY ZONES THIS HAS TREMENDOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EVOLUTION OF HUMAN SKIN PIGMENTATION
NinaJablonski_2009@233.74:245.08 AND WHAT DARWIN COULD NOT APPRECIATE OR DIDN'T PERHAPS WANT TO APPRECIATE AT THE TIME IS THAT THERE WAS A FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INTENSITY OF ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION
NinaJablonski_2009@245.46:252.84 AND SKIN PIGMENTATION AND THAT SKIN PIGMENTATION ITSELF WAS A PRODUCT OF EVOLUTION
NinaJablonski_2009@253.35:259.55 AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT A MAP OF SKIN COLOR AND PREDICTED SKIN COLOR AS WE KNOW IT TODAY
NinaJablonski_2009@259.80:268.32 WHAT WE SEE IS A BEAUTIFUL GRADIENT FROM THE DARKEST SKIN PIGMENTATIONS TOWARD THE EQUATOR AND THE LIGHTEST ONES TOWARD THE POLES
NinaJablonski_2009@269.70:274.82 WHAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT THE EARLIEST HUMANS
NinaJablonski_2009@285.93:298.91 AND WE ALL SHARE THIS INCREDIBLE HERITAGE OF HAVING ORIGINALLY BEEN DARKLY PIGMENTED TWO MILLION TO ONE AND HALF MILLION YEARS AGO NOW WHAT HAPPENED IN OUR HISTORY
NinaJablonski_2009@301.19:314.86 LET 'S FIRST LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP OF ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION TO THE EARTH 'S SURFACE IN THOSE EARLY DAYS OF OUR EVOLUTION LOOKING AT THE EQUATOR WE WERE BOMBARDED BY HIGH LEVELS OF ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION
NinaJablonski_2009@315.10:324.59 THE UVC THE MOST ENERGETIC TYPE WAS OCCLUDED BY THE EARTH 'S ATMOSPHERE BUT UVB AND UVA ESPECIALLY CAME IN UNIMPEDED
NinaJablonski_2009@325.70:334.51 TURNS OUT TO BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IT'S VERY DESTRUCTIVE BUT IT ALSO CATALYZES THE PRODUCTION OF VITAMIN D IN THE SKIN
NinaJablonski_2009@341.10:351.11 THE HEALTH OF OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM AND MYRIAD OTHER IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS IN OUR BODIES SO LIVING AT THE EQUATOR WE GOT LOTS AND LOTS OF ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION AND
NinaJablonski_2009@351.49:363.09 THE MELANIN THIS WONDERFUL COMPLEX ANCIENT POLYMER COMPOUND IN OUR SKIN SERVED AS A SUPERB NATURAL SUNSCREEN
NinaJablonski_2009@363.60:372.80 THIS POLYMER IS AMAZING BECAUSE IT'S PRESENT IN SO MANY DIFFERENT ORGANISMS MELANIN IN VARIOUS FORMS HAS PROBABLY BEEN ON THE EARTH A BILLION YEARS
NinaJablonski_2009@381.90:390.38 SO MELANIN WAS RECRUITED IN OUR LINEAGE AND SPECIFICALLY IN OUR EARLIEST ANCESTORS EVOLVING IN AFRICA
NinaJablonski_2009@390.80:404.18 TO BE A NATURAL SUNSCREEN WHERE IT PROTECTED THE BODY AGAINST THE DEGRADATIONS OF ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION THE DESTRUCTION OR DAMAGE TO DNA AND THE BREAKDOWN OF A VERY IMPORTANT MOLECULE CALLED
NinaJablonski_2009@404.93:417.22 WHICH HELPS TO FUEL CELL PRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTION IN THE BODY SO IT'S WONDERFUL WE EVOLVED THIS VERY PROTECTIVE WONDERFUL COVERING OF MELANIN BUT THEN
NinaJablonski_2009@417.49:418.27 WE MOVED
NinaJablonski_2009@421.34:429.62 HUMANS DISPERSED NOT ONCE BUT TWICE MAJOR MOVES OUTSIDE OF OUR EQUATORIAL HOMELAND FROM AFRICA
NinaJablonski_2009@450.48:463.35 LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION WE'RE STILL GETTING A DOSE OF UVA BUT ALL OF THE UVB OR NEARLY ALL OF IT IS DISSIPATED THROUGH THE THICKNESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE
NinaJablonski_2009@463.79:471.90 IN THE WINTER WHEN YOU ARE SKIING IN THE ALPS YOU MAY EXPERIENCE ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION BUT IT'S ALL UVA
NinaJablonski_2009@472.28:478.65 AND SIGNIFICANTLY THAT UVA HAS NO ABILITY TO MAKE VITAMIN D IN YOUR SKIN
NinaJablonski_2009@479.24:486.31 SO PEOPLE INHABITING NORTHERN HEMISPHERIC ENVIRONMENTS WERE BEREFT OF
NinaJablonski_2009@486.46:495.68 THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE VITAMIN D IN THEIR SKIN FOR MOST OF THE YEAR THIS HAD TREMENDOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE EVOLUTION OF HUMAN SKIN PIGMENTATION
NinaJablonski_2009@496.05:505.37 BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IN ORDER TO ENSURE HEALTH AND WELL BEING THESE LINEAGES OF PEOPLE DISPERSING INTO THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE
NinaJablonski_2009@506.40:515.72 LOST THEIR PIGMENTATION THERE WAS NATURAL SELECTION FOR THE EVOLUTION OF LIGHTLY PIGMENTED SKIN HERE WE
NinaJablonski_2009@516.05:526.51 TO SEE THE EVOLUTION OF THE BEAUTIFUL SEPIA RAINBOW THAT NOW CHARACTERIZES ALL OF HUMANITY LIGHTLY PIGMENTED SKIN EVOLVED NOT JUST ONCE
NinaJablonski_2009@526.92:535.28 NOT JUST TWICE BUT PROBABLY THREE TIMES NOT JUST IN MODERN HUMANS BUT IN ONE OF OUR DISTANT UNRELATED ANCESTORS
NinaJablonski_2009@535.66:544.45 THE NEANDERTHALS A REMARKABLE REMARKABLE TESTIMENT TO THE POWER OF EVOLUTION HUMANS HAVE BEEN ON THE MOVE FOR A LONG TIME AND
NinaJablonski_2009@544.80:556.22 JUST IN THE LAST FIVE THOUSAND YEARS IN INCREASING RATES OVER INCREASING DISTANCES HERE ARE JUST SOME OF THE BIGGEST MOVEMENTS OF PEOPLE VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS IN THE LAST FIVE THOUSAND YEARS
NinaJablonski_2009@556.55:564.50 LOOK AT SOME OF THE MAJOR LATITUDINAL TRANSGRESSIONS PEOPLE FROM HIGH UV AREAS GOING TO LOW UV AND VICE VERSA
NinaJablonski_2009@572.98:582.20 MILLION FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE MOVED FROM HIGH UV TO LOW UV AREAS IN THE TRANSATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE
NinaJablonski_2009@582.81:594.15 NOW THIS HAD ALL SORTS OF INVIDIOUS SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES BUT IT ALSO HAD DELETERIOUS HEALTH CONSEQUENCES TO PEOPLE SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN ON THE MOVE
NinaJablonski_2009@594.81:605.50 SO CLEVER WE CAN OVERCOME ALL OF THESE SEEMING BIOLOGICAL IMPEDIMENTS WELL OFTEN WE'RE UNAWARE OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE LIVING IN ENVIRONMENTS
NinaJablonski_2009@605.78:613.17 IN WHICH OUR SKIN IS INHERENTLY POORLY ADAPTED SOME OF US WITH LIGHTLY PIGMENTED SKIN LIVE IN HIGH UV AREAS
NinaJablonski_2009@613.39:621.88 SOME OF US WITH DARKLY PIGMENTED SKIN LIVE IN LOW UV AREAS THESE HAVE TREMENDOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR HEALTH
NinaJablonski_2009@622.40:629.65 WE HAVE TO IF WE'RE LIGHTLY PIGMENTED BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF SKIN CANCER
NinaJablonski_2009@629.98:640.32 AND DESTRUCTION OF FOLATE IN OUR BODIES BY LOTS OF SUN EPIDEMIOLOGISTS AND DOCTORS HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD ABOUT TELLING US ABOUT PROTECTING OUR SKIN
NinaJablonski_2009@641.07:653.64 WHAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN SO GOOD ABOUT INSTRUCTING PEOPLE IS THE PROBLEM OF DARKLY PIGMENTED PEOPLE LIVING IN HIGH LATITUDE AREAS OR WORKING INSIDE ALL THE TIME
NinaJablonski_2009@664.56:672.39 IS A MAJOR PROBLEM VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY CREEPS UP ON PEOPLE AND CAUSES ALL SORTS OF HEALTH PROBLEMS TO THEIR BONES TO THEIR
NinaJablonski_2009@684.29:697.72 SO WE HAVE IN SKIN PIGMENTATION ONE OF THESE WONDERFUL PRODUCTS OF EVOLUTION THAT STILL HAS CONSEQUENCES FOR US TODAY AND THE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES AS WE KNOW ARE INCREDIBLY PROFOUND
NinaJablonski_2009@698.05:712.18 WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE WE HAVE LIGHTLY AND DARKLY PIGMENTED PEOPLE LIVING NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER BUT OFTEN BROUGHT INTO PROXIMITY INITIALLY AS A RESULT OF VERY INVIDIOUS SOCIAL INTERACTIONS
NinaJablonski_2009@713.22:721.15 SO HOW CAN WE OVERCOME THIS HOW CAN WE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND IT EVOLUTION HELPS US
NinaJablonski_2009@721.91:729.66 TWO HUNDRED YEARS AFTER DARWIN 'S BIRTHDAY WE HAVE THE FIRST MODERATELY PIGMENTED PRESIDENT OF THE
NinaJablonski_2009@735.33:735.93 THIS MAN IS
NinaJablonski_2009@736.26:745.53 SIGNIFICANT FOR A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS BUT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW HE COMPARES IN TERMS OF HIS PIGMENTATION TO OTHER PEOPLE ON EARTH HE AS ONE OF
NinaJablonski_2009@745.91:753.35 MANY URBAN AND MIXED POPULATIONS IS VERY EMBLEMATIC OF A MIXED PARENTAGE OF A MIXED PIGMENTATION
NinaJablonski_2009@762.30:772.89 THESE PEOPLE HAVE A TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL TO TAN TO DEVELOP MORE PIGMENT IN THEIR SKIN AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO SUN THEY ALSO RUN THE RISK OF VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY
NinaJablonski_2009@773.38:784.54 IF THEY HAVE DESK JOBS LIKE THAT GUY SO LETS ALL WISH FOR HIS GREAT HEALTH AND HIS AWARENESS OF HIS OWN SKIN PIGMENTATION
NinaJablonski_2009@786.34:787.00 NOW
NinaJablonski_2009@787.77:796.22 WHAT IS WONDERFUL ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF HUMAN SKIN PIGMENTATION AND THE PHENOMENON OF PIGMENTATION IS THAT
NinaJablonski_2009@796.57:805.76 IT IS THE DEMONSTRATION THE EVIDENCE OF EVOLUTION BY NATURAL SELECTION RIGHT ON YOUR BODY
NinaJablonski_2009@807.21:817.08 WHEN PEOPLE ASK YOU WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE FOR EVOLUTION YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT SOME EXOTIC EXAMPLES OR FOSSILS YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR SKIN
NinaJablonski_2009@830.68:839.34 ABLE TO LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE TODAY HE WOULD UNDERSTAND IT HE WOULD APPRECIATE IT AND MOST OF ALL HE WOULD TEACH
NinaJablonski_2009@841.22:854.16 YOU YOU CAN TEACH IT YOU CAN TOUCH IT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT TAKE IT OUT OF THIS ROOM TAKE YOUR SKIN COLOR AND CELEBRATE IT
NinaJablonski_2009@855.09:862.52 SPREAD THE WORD YOU HAVE THE EVOLUTION OF THE HISTORY OF OUR SPECIES
NinaJablonski_2009@862.82:875.27 PART OF IT WRITTEN IN YOUR SKIN UNDERSTAND IT APPRECIATE IT CELEBRATE IT GO OUT ISN'T IS BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT WONDERFUL YOU ARE THE PRODUCTS OF EVOLUTION THANK YOU
