GaryLauder_2010@27.67:41.32 I'VE HAD SOME TIME TO THINK IT OVER AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS MORE THAN JUST ABOUT THE VEHICLE IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE ROAD ROAD DESIGN MAKES A DIFFERENCE PARTICULARLY INTERSECTIONS OF WHICH THERE ARE TWO TYPES SIGNALIZED AND UNSIGNALIZED WHICH MEANS STOP SIGNS
GaryLauder_2010@50.47:58.38 FROM WHEN YOU CONVERT A TRAFFIC LIGHT INTO A ROUNDABOUT INJURY CRASHES HAVE DROPPED SEVENTY SIX PERCENT FATAL CRASHES DOWN NINETY PERCENT
GaryLauder_2010@59.13:67.26 THAT'S JUST SAFETY WHAT ABOUT TIME AND GAS SO TRAFFIC KEEPS FLOWING SO THAT MEANS LESS BRAKING WHICH MEANS LESS ACCELERATING LESS GAS AND LESS POLLUTION
GaryLauder_2010@68.15:81.89 LESS TIME WASTED AND THAT PARTLY ACCOUNTS FOR EUROPE 'S BETTER EFFICIENCY THAN WE HAVE IN THE UNITED STATES SO UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS MEANING STOP SIGNS THEY SAVE MANY LIVES BUT THERE IS AN EXCESSIVE PROLIFERATION OF THEM SMALL ROUNDABOUTS ARE STARTING TO APPEAR
GaryLauder_2010@82.35:90.35 THIS IS ONE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND THEY ARE MUCH BETTER BETTER THAN TRAFFIC LIGHTS BETTER THAN FOUR WAY STOP SIGNS THEY'RE EXPENSIVE TO INSTALL
GaryLauder_2010@90.72:104.32 BUT THEY ARE MORE EXPENSIVE NOT TO SO WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT BUT THEY ARE NOT APPLICABLE IN ALL SITUTIONS SO TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE THREE WAY INTERSECTION SO IT'S LOGICAL THAT YOU'D HAVE ONE THERE ON THE MINOR ROAD ENTERING THE MAJOR BUT THE OTHER TWO ARE SOMEWHAT QUESTIONABLE
GaryLauder_2010@104.78:118.42 SO HERE 'S ONE THERE'S ANOTHER ONE WHICH I STUDIED CARS RARELY APPEAR ON THAT THIRD ROAD AND SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT DOES THAT COST US THAT INTERSECTION I LOOKED AT HAD ABOUT THREE THOUSAND CARS PER DAY IN EACH DIRECTION AND SO THAT'S TWO OUNCES OF GAS TO ACCELERATE OUT OF THAT'S FIVE CENTS
GaryLauder_2010@128.29:135.08 TEN SECONDS PER THREE THOUSAND CARS THAT'S EIGHT POINT THREE HOURS PER DAY THE AVERAGE WAGE IN THE U S IS DOLLAR TWENTY AN HOUR THAT IS
GaryLauder_2010@144.64:147.86 OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR A STOP
GaryLauder_2010@148.12:162.01 SIGN IN EACH DIRECTION NOW IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THAT ADJACENT PROPERTY IS WORTH YOU COULD ACTUALLY BUY THE PROPERTY CUT DOWN THE SHRUBBERY TO IMPROVE THE SIGHT LINE AND THEN SELL IT OFF AGAIN AND YOU'D STILL COME OUT AHEAD
GaryLauder_2010@162.46:170.84 SO IT MAKES ONE WONDER WHY IS IT THERE I MEAN WHY IS THERE THAT STOP SIGN IN EACH DIRECTION BECAUSE IT IS SAVING LIVES SO IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL
GaryLauder_2010@171.09:181.09 THE ANSWER IS TO ENABLE CARS TO COME IN FROM THAT SIDE ROAD SAFELY BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO MIGHT LIVE UP THERE AND IF THEY'RE WAITING FOREVER A LONG QUEUE COULD FORM BECAUSE THE CARS AREN'T SLOWING DOWN ON THE MAIN ROAD
GaryLauder_2010@192.12:201.84 SO WHY NOT USE A YIELD SIGN WELL THE MEANING OF YIELD IS YOU MUST YIELD THE RIGHT OF WAY THAT MEANS THAT IF THERE ARE FIVE CARS WAITING YOU HAVE TO WAIT TILL THEY ALL GO THEN YOU GO IT LACKS THE NOTION OF ALTERNATING OR TAKING TURNS
GaryLauder_2010@202.35:218.43 AND IT'S ALWAYS ON THE MINOR ROAD ALLOWING THE MAJOR ONE TO HAVE PRIMACY SO IT'S HARD TO CREATE A NEW MEANING FOR THE EXISTING SIGN YOU COULDN'T SUDDENLY TELL EVERYONE OKAY REMEMBER WHAT YOU USED TO DO AT YIELD SIGNS NOW DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT WOULD NOT WORK SO WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS NOW IS A NEW TYPE OF SIGN
GaryLauder_2010@222.87:223.26 SO
GaryLauder_2010@223.96:233.13 HAVE A LITTLE INSTRUCTION BELOW IT YOU KNOW FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T SEE THE PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS AND IT MERGES THE STOP SIGN AND YIELD SIGNS IT'S KIND OF SHAPED LIKE A T AS IN TAKING TURNS AND
GaryLauder_2010@251.51:258.42 AND YOU CAN HAVE MORE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT JUST GETTING YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD TO CHANGE THESE THINGS THAN BY CHANGING YOUR VEHICLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
