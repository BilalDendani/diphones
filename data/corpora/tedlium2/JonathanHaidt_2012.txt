JonathanHaidt_2012 FOR YOU ARE YOU RELIGIOUS
JonathanHaidt_2012 PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND RIGHT NOW IF YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS A RELIGIOUS PERSON
JonathanHaidt_2012 LET 'S SEE I 'D SAY ABOUT THREE OR FOUR PERCENT I HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE SO MANY BELIEVERS AT A TED CONFERENCE
JonathanHaidt_2012 DO YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS SPIRITUAL IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM RAISE YOUR HAND OKAY THAT 'S THE MAJORITY
JonathanHaidt_2012 MY TALK TODAY IS ABOUT THE MAIN REASON OR ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER THEMSELVES TO BE SPIRITUAL IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM MY TALK TODAY IS ABOUT SELF TRANSCENDENCE IT 'S JUST A BASIC FACT ABOUT BEING HUMAN THAT SOMETIMES THE SELF SEEMS TO JUST MELT AWAY
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE FEELING IS ECSTATIC
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND WE REACH FOR METAPHORS OF UP AND DOWN TO EXPLAIN THESE FEELINGS WE TALK ABOUT BEING UPLIFTED OR ELEVATED
JonathanHaidt_2012 NOW IT 'S REALLY HARD TO THINK ABOUT ANYTHING ABSTRACT LIKE THIS WITHOUT A GOOD CONCRETE METAPHOR SO HERE 'S THE METAPHOR I 'M OFFERING TODAY THINK ABOUT THE MIND AS BEING LIKE A HOUSE WITH MANY ROOMS MOST OF WHICH WE 'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH
JonathanHaidt_2012 BUT SOMETIMES IT 'S AS THOUGH A DOORWAY APPEARS FROM OUT OF NOWHERE
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND IT OPENS ONTO A STAIRCASE WE CLIMB THE STAIRCASE AND EXPERIENCE A STATE OF ALTERED CONSCIOUSNESS
JonathanHaidt_2012 IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND TWO THE GREAT AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST WILLIAM JAMES WROTE ABOUT THE MANY VARIETIES OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE
JonathanHaidt_2012 HE COLLECTED ALL KINDS OF CASE STUDIES HE QUOTED THE WORDS OF ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO 'D HAD A VARIETY OF THESE EXPERIENCES ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING TO ME IS THIS YOUNG MAN STEPHEN BRADLEY HAD AN ENCOUNTER HE THOUGHT WITH JESUS IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY AND HERE 'S WHAT BRADLEY
JonathanHaidt_2012 WITH ARMS EXTENDED
JonathanHaidt_2012 APPEARING TO SAY TO ME
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND COULD WITH A FEELING HEART FORGIVE MY WORST ENEMIES
JonathanHaidt_2012 SO NOTE HOW
JonathanHaidt_2012 BRADLEY 'S PETTY MORALISTIC SELF JUST DIES ON THE WAY UP THE STAIRCASE AND ON THIS HIGHER LEVEL HE BECOMES LOVING AND FORGIVING
JonathanHaidt_2012 THE WORLD 'S MANY RELIGIONS HAVE FOUND SO MANY WAYS TO HELP PEOPLE CLIMB THE STAIRCASE SOME SHUT DOWN THE SELF USING MEDITATION
JonathanHaidt_2012 OTHERS USE PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS THIS IS FROM A SIXTEENTH CENTURY AZTEC SCROLL SHOWING A MAN ABOUT TO EAT A PSILOCYBIN MUSHROOM AND AT THE SAME MOMENT GET YANKED UP THE STAIRCASE BY A GOD
JonathanHaidt_2012 OTHERS USE DANCING SPINNING AND CIRCLING TO PROMOTE SELF TRANSCENDENCE BUT YOU DON 'T NEED A RELIGION TO GET YOU THROUGH THE STAIRCASE LOTS OF PEOPLE FIND SELF TRANSCENDENCE IN NATURE OTHERS OVERCOME THEIR SELF AT RAVES
JonathanHaidt_2012 BUT HERE 'S THE WEIRDEST PLACE OF ALL
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND AFTER THE WAR HE INTERVIEWED A LOT OF OTHER SOLDIERS AND WROTE ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF MEN IN BATTLE HERE 'S A KEY PASSAGE WHERE HE BASICALLY DESCRIBES THE STAIRCASE
JonathanHaidt_2012 I BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOTHING LESS THAN THE ASSURANCE OF IMMORTALITY THAT MAKES SELF SACRIFICE AT THESE MOMENTS SO RELATIVELY EASY I MAY FALL BUT I DO NOT
JonathanHaidt_2012 FOR THAT WHICH IS REAL IN ME GOES FORWARD AND LIVES ON IN THE COMRADES FOR WHOM I GAVE UP MY LIFE
JonathanHaidt_2012 IS THAT THE SELF SEEMS TO THIN OUT OR MELT AWAY AND IT FEELS GOOD IT FEELS REALLY GOOD IN A WAY TOTALLY UNLIKE ANYTHING WE FEEL IN OUR NORMAL LIVES IT FEELS SOMEHOW UPLIFTING
JonathanHaidt_2012 THIS IDEA THAT WE MOVE UP WAS CENTRAL IN THE WRITING OF THE GREAT FRENCH SOCIOLOGIST EMILE DURKHEIM DURKHEIM EVEN CALLED US HOMO DUPLEX OR TWO LEVEL MAN
JonathanHaidt_2012 THE LOWER LEVEL HE CALLED THE LEVEL OF THE PROFANE NOW PROFANE IS THE OPPOSITE OF SACRED IT JUST MEANS ORDINARY OR COMMON AND IN OUR ORDINARY LIVES WE EXIST AS INDIVIDUALS WE WANT TO SATISFY OUR INDIVIDUAL DESIRES WE PURSUE OUR INDIVIDUAL GOALS
JonathanHaidt_2012 BUT SOMETIMES SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT TRIGGERS A PHASE CHANGE
JonathanHaidt_2012 INDIVIDUALS UNITE INTO A TEAM A MOVEMENT OR A NATION WHICH IS FAR MORE THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS DURKHEIM CALLED THIS LEVEL THE LEVEL OF THE SACRED BECAUSE HE BELIEVED THAT THE FUNCTION OF RELIGION WAS TO UNITE PEOPLE INTO A GROUP INTO A MORAL COMMUNITY
JonathanHaidt_2012 DURKHEIM BELIEVED THAT ANYTHING THAT UNITES US TAKES ON AN AIR OF SACREDNESS AND ONCE PEOPLE CIRCLE AROUND SOME SACRED OBJECT OR VALUE THEY 'LL THEN WORK AS A TEAM AND FIGHT TO DEFEND IT
JonathanHaidt_2012 DURKHEIM WROTE ABOUT A SET OF INTENSE COLLECTIVE EMOTIONS THAT ACCOMPLISH THIS MIRACLE OF E PLURIBUS UNUM OF MAKING A GROUP OUT OF INDIVIDUALS
JonathanHaidt_2012 THINK OF THE COLLECTIVE ANGER IN TAHRIR SQUARE WHICH BROUGHT DOWN A DICTATOR
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND THINK OF THE COLLECTIVE GRIEF IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WE ALL FELT THAT BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER AFTER NINE ELEVEN
JonathanHaidt_2012 SO LET ME SUMMARIZE WHERE WE ARE
JonathanHaidt_2012 I 'M SAYING THAT THE CAPACITY FOR SELF TRANSCENDENCE IS JUST A BASIC PART OF BEING HUMAN
JonathanHaidt_2012 I 'M OFFERING THE METAPHOR OF A STAIRCASE IN THE MIND
JonathanHaidt_2012 I 'M SAYING WE ARE HOMO DUPLEX
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND THIS STAIRCASE TAKES US UP FROM THE PROFANE LEVEL
JonathanHaidt_2012 TO THE LEVEL OF THE SACRED
JonathanHaidt_2012 WHEN WE CLIMB THAT STAIRCASE
JonathanHaidt_2012 SELF INTEREST FADES AWAY WE BECOME JUST MUCH LESS SELF INTERESTED AND WE FEEL AS THOUGH WE ARE BETTER NOBLER AND SOMEHOW UPLIFTED
JonathanHaidt_2012 SO HERE 'S THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION FOR SOCIAL SCIENTISTS LIKE ME
JonathanHaidt_2012 IS THE STAIRCASE A FEATURE
JonathanHaidt_2012 OF OUR EVOLUTIONARY DESIGN
JonathanHaidt_2012 IS IT A PRODUCT OF NATURAL SELECTION LIKE OUR HANDS
JonathanHaidt_2012 OR IS IT A BUG A MISTAKE IN THE SYSTEM THIS RELIGIOUS STUFF IS JUST SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS WHEN THE WIRES CROSS IN THE BRAIN JILL HAS A STROKE AND SHE HAS THIS RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE IT 'S JUST A MISTAKE
JonathanHaidt_2012 WELL MANY SCIENTISTS WHO STUDY RELIGION TAKE THIS VIEW THE NEW ATHEISTS FOR EXAMPLE ARGUE THAT RELIGION IS A SET OF MEMES SORT OF PARASITIC MEMES THAT GET INSIDE OUR MINDS AND MAKE US DO ALL KINDS OF CRAZY RELIGIOUS STUFF SELF DESTRUCTIVE STUFF LIKE SUICIDE BOMBING
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND AFTER ALL HOW COULD IT EVER BE GOOD FOR US TO LOSE OURSELVES
JonathanHaidt_2012 HOW COULD IT EVER BE ADAPTIVE FOR ANY ORGANISM
JonathanHaidt_2012 TO OVERCOME SELF INTEREST
JonathanHaidt_2012 ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF MORALITY WHERE DID IT COME FROM WHY DO WE HAVE IT
JonathanHaidt_2012 DARWIN NOTED THAT MANY OF OUR VIRTUES ARE OF VERY LITTLE USE TO OURSELVES BUT THEY 'RE OF GREAT USE TO OUR GROUPS
JonathanHaidt_2012 HE WROTE ABOUT THE SCENARIO IN WHICH TWO TRIBES OF EARLY HUMANS WOULD HAVE COME IN CONTACT AND COMPETITION HE SAID IF THE ONE TRIBE INCLUDED A GREAT NUMBER OF COURAGEOUS SYMPATHETIC AND FAITHFUL MEMBERS WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO AID AND DEFEND EACH OTHER THIS TRIBE WOULD SUCCEED BETTER AND CONQUER THE OTHER
JonathanHaidt_2012 HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT SELFISH AND CONTENTIOUS PEOPLE WILL NOT COHERE AND WITHOUT COHERENCE NOTHING CAN BE EFFECTED
JonathanHaidt_2012 IN OTHER WORDS CHARLES DARWIN
JonathanHaidt_2012 BELIEVED IN GROUP SELECTION
JonathanHaidt_2012 NOW THIS IDEA HAS BEEN VERY CONTROVERSIAL FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS BUT IT 'S ABOUT TO MAKE A MAJOR COMEBACK THIS YEAR ESPECIALLY AFTER E O WILSON 'S BOOK COMES OUT IN APRIL MAKING A VERY STRONG CASE
JonathanHaidt_2012 THAT WE AND SEVERAL OTHER SPECIES ARE PRODUCTS OF GROUP SELECTION BUT REALLY THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS AS MULTILEVEL SELECTION SO LOOK AT IT THIS WAY
JonathanHaidt_2012 YOU 'VE GOT COMPETITION GOING ON WITHIN GROUPS AND ACROSS GROUPS SO HERE 'S A GROUP OF GUYS ON A COLLEGE CREW TEAM WITHIN THIS TEAM
JonathanHaidt_2012 THERE 'S COMPETITION THERE ARE GUYS COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER THE SLOWEST ROWERS THE WEAKEST ROWERS ARE GOING TO GET CUT FROM THE TEAM AND ONLY A FEW OF THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO GO ON IN THE SPORT MAYBE ONE OF THEM WILL MAKE IT TO THE OLYMPICS SO WITHIN THE TEAM THEIR INTERESTS ARE ACTUALLY PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND SOMETIMES IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR ONE OF THESE GUYS TO TRY TO SABOTAGE THE OTHER GUYS MAYBE HE 'LL BADMOUTH HIS CHIEF RIVAL TO THE COACH
JonathanHaidt_2012 BUT WHILE THAT COMPETITION IS GOING ON WITHIN THE BOAT
JonathanHaidt_2012 THIS COMPETITION IS GOING ON ACROSS BOATS
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND ONCE YOU PUT THESE GUYS IN A BOAT COMPETING WITH ANOTHER BOAT NOW THEY 'VE GOT NO CHOICE BUT TO COOPERATE BECAUSE THEY 'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT THEY CAN ONLY WIN IF THEY ALL PULL TOGETHER AS A TEAM I MEAN THESE THINGS SOUND TRITE BUT THEY ARE DEEP EVOLUTIONARY TRUTHS
JonathanHaidt_2012 THE MAIN ARGUMENT AGAINST GROUP SELECTION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT WELL SURE IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A GROUP OF COOPERATORS BUT AS SOON AS YOU HAVE A GROUP OF COOPERATORS THEY 'RE JUST GOING TO GET TAKEN OVER BY FREE RIDERS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE GOING TO EXPLOIT THE HARD WORK OF THE OTHERS LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS FOR YOU
JonathanHaidt_2012 SUPPOSE WE 'VE GOT A GROUP OF LITTLE ORGANISMS THEY CAN BE BACTERIA THEY CAN BE HAMSTERS IT DOESN 'T MATTER WHAT AND LET 'S SUPPOSE THAT THIS LITTLE GROUP HERE THEY EVOLVED TO BE COOPERATIVE WELL THAT 'S GREAT THEY GRAZE THEY DEFEND EACH OTHER THEY WORK TOGETHER THEY GENERATE WEALTH
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND AS YOU 'LL SEE IN THIS SIMULATION AS THEY INTERACT THEY GAIN POINTS AS IT WERE THEY GROW AND WHEN THEY 'VE DOUBLED IN SIZE YOU 'LL SEE THEM SPLIT AND THAT 'S HOW THEY REPRODUCE AND THE POPULATION GROWS
JonathanHaidt_2012 BUT SUPPOSE THEN THAT ONE OF THEM MUTATES THERE 'S A MUTATION IN THE GENE AND ONE OF THEM MUTATES TO FOLLOW A SELFISH STRATEGY IT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE OTHERS AND SO WHEN A GREEN INTERACTS WITH A BLUE
JonathanHaidt_2012 YOU 'LL SEE THE GREEN GETS LARGER AND THE BLUE GETS SMALLER SO HERE 'S HOW THINGS PLAY OUT
JonathanHaidt_2012 WE START WITH JUST ONE GREEN AND AS IT INTERACTS IT GAINS WEALTH OR POINTS OR FOOD
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND IN SHORT ORDER THE COOPERATORS ARE DONE FOR THE FREE RIDERS HAVE TAKEN OVER IF A GROUP CANNOT SOLVE THE FREE RIDER PROBLEM
JonathanHaidt_2012 THEN IT CANNOT REAP THE BENEFITS OF COOPERATION
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND GROUP SELECTION CANNOT GET STARTED
JonathanHaidt_2012 BUT THERE ARE SOLUTIONS TO THE FREE RIDER PROBLEM IT 'S NOT THAT HARD A PROBLEM IN FACT NATURE HAS SOLVED IT MANY MANY TIMES AND NATURE 'S FAVORITE SOLUTION IS TO PUT EVERYONE IN THE SAME BOAT
JonathanHaidt_2012 FOR EXAMPLE WHY IS IT
JonathanHaidt_2012 THAT THE MITOCHONDRIA
JonathanHaidt_2012 IN EVERY CELL HAS ITS OWN DNA TOTALLY SEPARATE FROM THE DNA IN THE NUCLEUS
JonathanHaidt_2012 IT 'S BECAUSE THEY USED TO BE SEPARATE FREE LIVING BACTERIA AND THEY CAME TOGETHER AND BECAME A SUPERORGANISM
JonathanHaidt_2012 SOMEHOW OR OTHER MAYBE ONE SWALLOWED ANOTHER WE 'LL NEVER KNOW EXACTLY WHY BUT ONCE THEY GOT A MEMBRANE AROUND THEM THEY WERE ALL IN THE SAME MEMBRANE NOW ALL THE WEALTH CREATED DIVISION OF LABOR ALL THE GREATNESS CREATED BY COOPERATION STAYS LOCKED INSIDE THE MEMBRANE AND WE 'VE GOT A SUPERORGANISM
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND NOW LET 'S RERUN THE SIMULATION PUTTING ONE OF THESE SUPERORGANISMS INTO A POPULATION OF FREE RIDERS OF DEFECTORS OF CHEATERS AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENS
JonathanHaidt_2012 A SUPERORGANISM CAN BASICALLY TAKE WHAT IT WANTS IT 'S SO BIG AND POWERFUL AND EFFICIENT THAT IT CAN TAKE RESOURCES FROM THE GREENS FROM THE DEFECTORS THE CHEATERS AND PRETTY SOON THE WHOLE POPULATION IS ACTUALLY COMPOSED OF THESE NEW SUPERORGANISMS
JonathanHaidt_2012 WHAT I 'VE SHOWN YOU HERE IS SOMETIMES CALLED A MAJOR TRANSITION IN EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY
JonathanHaidt_2012 DARWIN 'S LAWS DON 'T CHANGE BUT NOW THERE 'S A NEW KIND OF PLAYER ON THE FIELD
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND THINGS BEGIN TO LOOK VERY DIFFERENT NOW THIS TRANSITION WAS NOT A ONE TIME FREAK OF NATURE THAT JUST HAPPENED WITH SOME BACTERIA IT HAPPENED AGAIN ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY OR A ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION YEARS AGO WHEN SOME SOLITARY WASPS BEGAN CREATING LITTLE SIMPLE PRIMITIVE NESTS OR HIVES
JonathanHaidt_2012 ONCE SEVERAL WASPS WERE ALL TOGETHER IN THE SAME HIVE THEY HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO COOPERATE BECAUSE PRETTY SOON THEY WERE LOCKED INTO COMPETITION WITH OTHER HIVES AND THE MOST COHESIVE HIVES WON JUST AS DARWIN SAID
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN EVEN MORE SPECTACULARLY IN THE LAST HALF MILLION YEARS WHEN OUR OWN ANCESTORS BECAME CULTURAL CREATURES
JonathanHaidt_2012 THEY CAME TOGETHER AROUND A HEARTH OR A CAMPFIRE THEY DIVIDED LABOR THEY BEGAN PAINTING THEIR BODIES THEY SPOKE THEIR OWN DIALECTS AND EVENTUALLY THEY WORSHIPED THEIR OWN GODS ONCE THEY WERE ALL IN THE SAME TRIBE THEY COULD KEEP THE BENEFITS OF COOPERATION LOCKED INSIDE
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND THEY UNLOCKED THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE EVER KNOWN ON THIS PLANET
JonathanHaidt_2012 WHICH IS HUMAN COOPERATION
JonathanHaidt_2012 A FORCE FOR CONSTRUCTION AND DESTRUCTION
JonathanHaidt_2012 OF COURSE HUMAN GROUPS ARE NOWHERE NEAR AS COHESIVE AS BEEHIVES
JonathanHaidt_2012 HUMAN GROUPS MAY LOOK LIKE HIVES FOR BRIEF MOMENTS BUT THEY TEND TO THEN BREAK APART WE 'RE NOT LOCKED INTO COOPERATION THE WAY BEES AND ANTS ARE IN FACT OFTEN AS WE 'VE SEEN HAPPEN IN A LOT OF THE ARAB SPRING REVOLTS OFTEN THOSE DIVISIONS ARE ALONG RELIGIOUS LINES
JonathanHaidt_2012 NONETHELESS WHEN PEOPLE DO COME TOGETHER AND PUT THEMSELVES ALL INTO THE SAME MOVEMENT THEY CAN MOVE MOUNTAINS
JonathanHaidt_2012 LOOK AT THE PEOPLE IN THESE PHOTOS I 'VE BEEN SHOWING YOU
JonathanHaidt_2012 DO YOU THINK THEY 'RE THERE PURSUING THEIR SELF INTEREST
JonathanHaidt_2012 OR ARE THEY PURSUING COMMUNAL INTEREST
JonathanHaidt_2012 WHICH REQUIRES THEM TO LOSE THEMSELVES AND BECOME SIMPLY A PART OF A WHOLE
JonathanHaidt_2012 AND NOW I 'M GOING TO GIVE THE WHOLE TALK OVER AGAIN IN THREE MINUTES IN A MORE FULL SPECTRUM SORT OF WAY
JonathanHaidt_2012 HUMANS HAVE MANY VARIETIES OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE AS WILLIAM JAMES
JonathanHaidt_2012 BUT IF IT IS AN ADAPTATION THEN THE IMPLICATIONS ARE PROFOUND
JonathanHaidt_2012 IF IT IS AN ADAPTATION
JonathanHaidt_2012 THEN WE EVOLVED TO BE RELIGIOUS
JonathanHaidt_2012 I DON 'T MEAN THAT WE EVOLVED TO JOIN GIGANTIC ORGANIZED RELIGIONS THOSE THINGS CAME ALONG TOO RECENTLY
JonathanHaidt_2012 WE UNLEASHED EARTH CHANGING CREATIVITY
JonathanHaidt_2012 NOWADAYS WE FLY AROUND LIKE INDIVIDUAL BEES EXULTING IN OUR FREEDOM BUT SOMETIMES WE
JonathanHaidt_2012 MOST PEOPLE LONG TO OVERCOME PETTINESS
JonathanHaidt_2012 CONJURED UP NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO
JonathanHaidt_2012 NO MAN IS AN ISLAND
JonathanHaidt_2012 A PART OF THE MAIN JH THANK YOU
