BrianCox_2010S@16.40:28.36 WE LIVE IN DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES OF COURSE AND ONE OF THE FIRST VICTIMS OF DIFFICULT ECONOMIC TIMES I THINK IS PUBLIC SPENDING OF ANY KIND
BrianCox_2010S@28.64:36.54 BUT CERTAINLY IN THE FIRING LINE AT THE MOMENT IS PUBLIC SPENDING FOR SCIENCE AND PARTICULARLY CURIOSITY LED SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION
BrianCox_2010S@36.94:45.21 SO I WANT TO TRY AND CONVINCE YOU IN ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES THAT THAT'S A RIDICULOUS AND LUDICROUS THING TO DO BUT I THINK TO SET THE SCENE
BrianCox_2010S@45.65:53.36 I WANT TO SHOW THE NEXT SLIDE IS NOT MY ATTEMPT TO SHOW THE WORST TED SLIDE IN THE HISTORY OF TED BUT IT IS A BIT OF A MESS
BrianCox_2010S@54.61:66.38 BUT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT MY FAULT IT'S FROM THE GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER AND IT'S ACTUALLY A BEAUTIFUL DEMONSTRATION OF HOW MUCH SCIENCE COSTS BECAUSE IF I'M GOING TO MAKE THE CASE FOR CONTINUING TO SPEND ON CURIOSITY DRIVEN SCIENCE
BrianCox_2010S@67.08:77.77 I SHOULD TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT COSTS SO THIS IS A GAME CALLED SPOT THE SCIENCE BUDGETS THIS IS THE U K GOVERNMENT SPEND YOU SEE THERE IT'S ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY BILLION A YEAR THE SCIENCE BUDGET IS ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK
BrianCox_2010S@77.87:84.71 TO YOUR LEFT THERE'S A PURPLE SET OF BLOBS AND THEN YELLOW SET OF BLOBS AND IT'S ONE OF THE YELLOW SET OF BLOBS
BrianCox_2010S@85.10:94.75 AROUND THE BIG YELLOW BLOB IT'S ABOUT THREE POINT THREE BILLION POUNDS PER YEAR OUT OF SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY BILLION THAT FUNDS EVERYTHING IN THE U K FROM MEDICAL RESEARCH SPACE EXPLORATION
BrianCox_2010S@95.32:108.49 WHERE I WORK AT CERN IN GENEVA PARTICLE PHYSICS ENGINEERING EVEN ARTS AND HUMANITIES FUNDED FROM THE SCIENCE BUDGET WHICH IS THAT THREE POINT THREE BILLION THAT LITTLE TINY YELLOW BLOB AROUND THE ORANGE BLOB AT THE TOP LEFT OF THE SCREEN
BrianCox_2010S@135.24:141.71 SENT BACK BY THE CASSINI SPACE PROBE AROUND SATURN AFTER WE'D FINISHED FILMING WONDERS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM SO IT ISN'T IN THE SERIES
BrianCox_2010S@142.15:149.97 THE MOON ENCELADUS SO THAT BIG SWEEPING WHITE SPHERE IN THE CORNER IS SATURN WHICH IS ACTUALLY IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE PICTURE
BrianCox_2010S@150.34:158.84 AND THAT CRESCENT THERE IS THE MOON ENCELADUS WHICH IS ABOUT AS BIG AS THE BRITISH ISLES IT'S ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED KM IN DIAMETER SO TINY MOON
BrianCox_2010S@159.38:172.37 WHAT'S FASCINATING AND BEAUTIFUL THIS AN UNPROCESSED PICTURE BY THE WAY I SHOULD SAY IT'S BLACK AND WHITE STRAIGHT FROM SATURNIAN ORBIT WHAT'S BEAUTIFUL IS YOU CAN PROBABLY SEE IN THE LIMB THERE SOME FAINT SORT OF WISPS OF ALMOST SMOKE
BrianCox_2010S@187.08:198.28 THAT'S FASCINATING AND BEAUTIFUL IN ITSELF BUT WE THINK THAT THE MECHANISM FOR POWERING THOSE FOUNTAINS REQUIRES THERE TO BE LAKES OF LIQUID WATER BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THIS MOON
BrianCox_2010S@198.68:207.84 AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT IS THAT ON OUR PLANET ON EARTH WHEREVER WE FIND LIQUID WATER WE FIND LIFE SO TO FIND
BrianCox_2010S@216.11:224.09 IS REALLY QUITE ASTOUNDING SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING ESSENTIALLY IS MAYBE THAT'S A HABITAT FOR LIFE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM
BrianCox_2010S@233.90:241.22 JUST A FEW HUNDRED KILOMETERS ABOVE THE SURFACE AND SO THIS AGAIN A REAL PICTURE OF THE ICE FOUNTAINS RISING UP INTO SPACE ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL
BrianCox_2010S@241.82:254.20 BUT THAT'S NOT THE PRIME CANDIDATE FOR LIFE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM THAT'S PROBABLY THIS PLACE WHICH IS A MOON OF JUPITER EUROPA AND AGAIN WE HAD TO FLY TO THE JOVIAN SYSTEM TO GET ANY SENSE THAT THIS MOON AS MOST MOONS
BrianCox_2010S@265.32:274.83 BUT BY MEASURE THE WAY THAT EUROPA INTERACTS WITH THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF JUPITER AND LOOKING AT HOW THOSE CRACKS IN THE ICE THAT YOU CAN SEE THERE ON THAT GRAPHIC MOVE AROUND
BrianCox_2010S@275.24:285.23 WE'VE INFERRED VERY STRONGLY THAT THERE'S AN OCEAN OF LIQUID SURROUNDING THE ENTIRE SURFACE OF EUROPA SO BELOW THE ICE THERE'S AN OCEAN OF LIQUID AROUND THE WHOLE MOON
BrianCox_2010S@285.65:296.47 IT COULD BE HUNDREDS OF KILOMETERS DEEP WE THINK WE THINK IT'S SALTWATER AND THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THERE'S MORE WATER ON THAT MOON OF JUPITER THAN THERE IS IN ALL THE OCEANS OF THE EARTH COMBINED
BrianCox_2010S@296.98:310.11 SO THAT PLACE A LITTLE MOON AROUND JUPITER IS PROBABLY THE PRIME CANDIDATE FOR FINDING LIFE ON A MOON OR A BODY OUTSIDE THE EARTH THAT WE KNOW OF TREMENDOUS AND BEAUTIFUL DISCOVERY
BrianCox_2010S@310.68:322.54 OUR EXPLORATION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM HAS TAUGHT US THAT THE SOLAR SYSTEM IS BEAUTIFUL IT MAY ALSO HAVE POINTED THE WAY TO ANSWERING ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND QUESTIONS THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLY ASK WHICH IS ARE WE ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE
BrianCox_2010S@349.58:360.39 TURBULENT YEAR THE STUDENT RIOTS IN PARIS THE HEIGHT OF THE VIETNAM WAR THE REASON MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT ABOUT THIS PICTURE AND AL GORE HAS SAID IT MANY TIMES ACTUALY ON THE STAGE AT TED
BrianCox_2010S@360.77:369.04 IS THAT THIS PICTURE ARGUABLY WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME WE SAW OUR WORLD NOT AS
BrianCox_2010S@369.98:381.24 WELL A SOLID IMMOVABLE KIND OF INDESTRUCTIBLE PLACE BUT AS A VERY SMALL FRAGILE LOOKING WORLD JUST HANGING AGAINST THE BLACKNESS OF SPACE WHAT'S ALSO NOT OFTEN
BrianCox_2010S@393.50:400.13 IT COST A LOT DIDN'T IT WELL ACTUALLY MANY STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE ABOUT THE ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF
BrianCox_2010S@410.39:424.81 SO THE APOLLO PROGRAM PAID FOR ITSELF IN INSPIRATION IN ENGINEERING ACHIEVEMENT AND I THINK IN INSPIRING YOUNG SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS FOURTEEN TIMES OVER SO EXPLORATION CAN PAY FOR ITSELF WHAT ABOUT
BrianCox_2010S@437.19:446.61 EIGHTEEN EIGHTIES EIGHTEEN NINETIES MANY SCIENTISTS MANY OBSERVERS LOOKED AT THE LIGHT GIVEN OFF FROM ATOMS AND THEY SAW STRANGE PICTURES LIKE THIS
BrianCox_2010S@447.07:457.18 YOU PUT IT THROUGH A PRISM IS THAT YOU HEAT HYDROGEN UP AND IT DOESN'T JUST GLOW LIKE A WHITE LIGHT IT JUST EMITS LIGHT AT PARTICULAR COLORS A RED ONE A LIGHT BLUE ONE
BrianCox_2010S@458.73:471.11 NOW THAT LED TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF ATOMIC STRUCTURE BECAUSE THE WAY THAT'S EXPLAINED IS ATOMS ARE A SINGLE NUCLEUS WITH ELECTRONS GOING AROUND THEM AND THE ELECTRONS CAN ONLY BE IN PARTICULAR PLACES AND WHEN THEY JUMP
BrianCox_2010S@481.49:493.28 WAS ONE OF THE KEY DRIVERS THAT LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE QUANTUM THEORY THE THEORY OF THE STRUCTURE OF ATOMS I JUST WANTED TO SHOW THIS PICTURE BECAUSE THIS IS REMARKABLE THIS IS ACTUALLY A PICTURE OF THE SPECTRUM OF THE SUN
BrianCox_2010S@504.71:512.08 BUT LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF BLACK LINES IN THAT SPECTRUM AND THE ELEMENT HELIUM WAS DISCOVERED JUST BY STARING AT THE LIGHT FROM THE SUN
BrianCox_2010S@520.34:533.55 HELIOS FROM THE SUN NOW THAT SOUNDS ESOTERIC AND INDEED IT WAS AN ESOTERIC PURSUIT BUT THE QUANTUM THEORY QUICKLY LED TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE BEHAVIORS OF ELECTRONS IN MATERIALS LIKE SILICON FOR EXAMPLE
BrianCox_2010S@547.70:556.79 WE WOULDN'T HAVE TRANSISTORS WE WOULDN'T HAVE SILICON CHIPS WE WOULDN'T HAVE PRETTY MUCH THE BASIS OF OUR MODERN ECONOMY THERE'S ONE MORE I THINK WONDERFUL TWIST TO THAT
BrianCox_2010S@558.16:565.64 IN WONDERS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM WE KEPT EMPHASIZING THE LAWS OF PHYSICS ARE UNIVERSAL IT'S ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE THINGS ABOUT THE PHYSICS
BrianCox_2010S@591.13:602.77 IMPOSED ON THE MASS OF STARS YOU CAN WORK IT OUT ON A PIECE OF PAPER IN LABORATORY GET A TELESCOPE SWING IT TO THE SKY AND YOU FIND THAT THERE ARE NO DEAD STARS BIGGER THAN ONE POINT FOUR TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN
BrianCox_2010S@610.41:617.84 THIS IS THE PICTURE OF A GALAXY A COMMON OUR GARDEN GALAXY WITH WHAT ONE HUNDRED BILLION STARS LIKE OUR SUN IN IT IT'S JUST ONE OF
BrianCox_2010S@618.43:628.97 BILLIONS OF GALAXIES IN THE UNIVERSE THERE ARE A BILLION STARS IN THE GALACTIC CORE WHICH IS WHY IT'S SHINING OUT SO BRIGHTLY THIS IS ABOUT FIFTY MILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY SO ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORING GALAXIES
BrianCox_2010S@629.47:637.95 BUT THAT BRIGHT STAR THERE IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE STARS IN THE GALAXY SO THAT STAR IS ALSO FIFTY MILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY
BrianCox_2010S@649.00:661.42 THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE PHENOMENA BECAUSE IT'S A STAR THAT SITS THERE IT'S CALLED A CARBON OXYGEN DWARF IT SITS THERE ABOUT SAY ONE POINT THREE TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN AND IT HAS A BINARY COMPANION THAT GOES AROUND IT SO A BIG
BrianCox_2010S@661.91:668.42 STAR A BIG BALL OF GAS AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT SUCKS GAS OFF ITS COMPANION STAR UNTIL IT GETS TO THIS
BrianCox_2010S@670.67:680.52 AND THEN IT EXPLODES AND IT EXPLODES AND IT SHINES AS BRIGHTLY AS A BILLION SUNS FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS AND RELEASES NOT ONLY ENERGY BUT A HUGE AMOUNT OF
BrianCox_2010S@707.09:717.59 I THINK THAT'S A REMARKABLE DEMONSTRATION OF THE POWER AND BEAUTY AND UNIVERSALITY OF THE LAWS OF PHYSICS BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT PROCESS BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE OF ATOMS
BrianCox_2010S@727.15:738.14 I CERTAINLY DIDN'T PLAN TO REVOLUTIONIZE ALL MEDICINE BY DISCOVERING THE WORLD 'S FIRST ANTIBIOTIC NOW THE EXPLORERS OF THE WORLD OF THE ATOM DID NOT INTEND TO INVENT THE TRANSISTOR AND THEY CERTAINLY DIDN'T INTEND TO
BrianCox_2010S@748.41:756.92 SO I THINK SCIENCE CAN BE SERENDIPITY IS IMPORTANT IT CAN BE BEAUTIFUL IT CAN REVEAL QUITE ASTONISHING THINGS IT CAN ALSO
BrianCox_2010S@757.29:771.15 I THINK FINALLY REVEAL THE MOST PROFOUND IDEAS TO US ABOUT OUR PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE AND REALLY THE VALUE OF OUR HOME PLANET THIS IS A SPECTACULAR PICTURE OR OUR HOME PLANET NOW IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
BrianCox_2010S@772.13:781.57 IT LOOKS LIKE SATURN BECAUSE OF COURSE IT IS IT WAS TAKEN BY THE CASSINI SPACE PROBE BUT IT'S A FAMOUS PICTURE NOT BECAUSE OF THE BEAUTY AND MAJESTY OF SATURN 'S RINGS
BrianCox_2010S@781.76:788.39 BUT ACTUALLY BECAUSE OF A TINY FAINT BLOB JUST HANGING UNDERNEATH ONE OF THE RINGS AND IF I BLOW IT UP THERE YOU SEE
BrianCox_2010S@788.96:799.29 LIKE A MOON BUT IN FACT IT'S A PICTURE OF EARTH IT WAS A PICTURE OF EARTH CAPTURED IN THAT FRAME OF SATURN THAT'S OUR PLANET FROM SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION MILES AWAY
BrianCox_2010S@810.34:819.36 THE VOYAGER SPACECRAFT AND THAT'S A PICTURE OF ME IN FRONT OF IT FOR SCALE THE VOYAGER IS A TINY MACHINE IT'S CURRENTLY TEN BILLION MILES AWAY FROM
BrianCox_2010S@842.91:848.48 VERY HARD TO SEE THE EARTH THERE IT'S CALLED THE PALE BLUE DOT PICTURE BUT EARTH IS SUSPENDED IN THAT SHAFT
BrianCox_2010S@848.58:857.15 OF LIGHT THAT'S EARTH FROM FOUR BILLION MILES AWAY AND I'D LIKE TO READ YOU WHAT SAGAN WROTE ABOUT IT JUST TO FINISH BECAUSE I CANNOT SAY
BrianCox_2010S@857.80:864.49 WORDS AS BEAUTIFUL AS THIS TO DESCRIBE WHAT HE SAW IN THAT PICTURE THAT HE HAD TAKEN HE SAID CONSIDER AGAIN THAT
BrianCox_2010S@865.27:876.19 THAT'S HERE THAT'S HOME THAT'S US ON IT EVERYONE YOU LOVE EVERYONE YOU KNOW EVERYONE YOU'VE EVER HEARD OF EVERY HUMAN BEING WHO EVER WAS LIVED OUT THEIR LIVES
BrianCox_2010S@876.45:889.16 THE AGGREGATES OF JOY AND SUFFERING THOUSANDS OF CONFIDENT RELIGIONS IDEOLOGIES AND ECONOMIC DOCTRINES EVERY HUNTER AND FORAGER EVERY HERO AND COWARD EVERY CREATOR AND DESTROYER OF CIVILIZATION
BrianCox_2010S@889.49:899.07 EVERY KING AND PEASANT EVERY YOUNG COUPLE IN LOVE EVERY MOTHER AND FATHER HOPEFUL CHILD INVENTOR AND EXPLORER EVERY TEACHER OF MORALS EVERY CORRUPT POLITICIAN
BrianCox_2010S@920.36:928.97 TO ME IT UNDERSCORES OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DEAL MORE KINDLY WITH ONE ANOTHER AND TO PRESERVE AND CHERISH THE PALE BLUE DOT THE ONLY HOME WE'VE EVER KNOWN
BrianCox_2010S@961.53:969.36 THE TURN OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY JUST EXPLOIT IT JUST BUILD THINGS HE SAID THIS HE SAID NOTHING IS MORE FATAL TO THE PROGRESS OF THE HUMAN MIND
BrianCox_2010S@970.91:980.34 THAT OUR VIEWS OF SCIENCE ARE ULTIMATE THAT OUR TRIUMPHS ARE COMPLETE THAT THERE ARE NO MYSTERIES IN NATURE AND THAT THERE ARE NO NEW WORLDS TO CONQUER THANK YOU
