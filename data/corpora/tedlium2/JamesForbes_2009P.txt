JamesForbes_2009P IF YOU COME IN YOU WILL SEE US EVENING TIME AT TABLE SET FOR TEN BUT NOT ALWAYS ALL SEATS FILLED
JamesForbes_2009P AT THE POINT WHEN DINNER IS READY TO BE SERVED SINCE MOM HAD EIGHT KIDS SOMETIMES SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T TELL WHO WAS WHO AND WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE WE COULD EAT SHE WOULD
JamesForbes_2009P ALL THE CHILDREN IN AND IF SOMEONE HAPPENED TO BE MISSING
JamesForbes_2009P WE SAY FIX A PLATE FOR THAT PERSON PUT IT IN THE OVEN THEN WE COULD SAY GRACE AND WE COULD EAT
JamesForbes_2009P ALSO WHILE WE WERE AT THE TABLE THERE WAS A RITUAL IN OUR FAMILY
JamesForbes_2009P WHEN SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT HAD HAPPENED FOR ANY ONE OF US WHETHER MOM HAD JUST BEEN ELECTED AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE
JamesForbes_2009P OR WHETHER DAD HAD GOTTEN AN ASSIGNMENT AT THE COLLEGE OF OUR DENOMINATION OR WHETHER SOMEONE HAD WON THE JABBERWOCKY CONTEST FOR TALENT
JamesForbes_2009P THE RITUAL AT THE FAMILY WAS ONCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT IS MADE WE MUST TAKE FIVE TEN MINUTES TO DO WHAT WE CALL MAKE OVER THAT PERSON
JamesForbes_2009P THAT IS TO MAKE A FUSS OVER THE ONE WHO HAD BEEN HONORED IN SOME WAY FOR WHEN ONE IS HONORED
JamesForbes_2009P ALL ARE HONORED ALSO WE HAD TO MAKE A REPORT ON OUR
JamesForbes_2009P EXTENDED VISITED
JamesForbes_2009P MEMBERS THAT IS EXTENDED MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY SICK
JamesForbes_2009P ELDERLY SHUT IN MY TASK WAS AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK TO VISIT MOTHER LASSITER WHO LIVED ON EAST STREET
JamesForbes_2009P MOTHER WILLIAMSON WHO LIVED ON BLEDSOE AVENUE MOTHER LATHERS WHO LIVED ON OBERLIN ROAD WHY BECAUSE THEY
JamesForbes_2009P AND INFIRM AND WE NEEDED TO GO BY TO SEE IF THEY NEEDED ANYTHING FOR MOM SAID TO BE FAMILY IS TO CARE AND SHARE AND TO LOOK
JamesForbes_2009P FOR ONE ANOTHER THEY ARE OUR FAMILY AND
JamesForbes_2009P TO GIVE ME THIS WAS THE NATURE OF BEING AT THAT TABLE IN FACT SHE INDICATED THAT
JamesForbes_2009P IF WE WOULD DO THAT NOT ONLY WOULD WE HAVE THE JOY OF RECEIVING THE GRATITUDE FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE EXTENDED FAMILY BUT SHE SAID EVEN
JamesForbes_2009P GOD WILL SMILE AND WHEN GOD SMILES THERE IS PEACE AND JUSTICE AND JOY SO AT THE TABLE AT NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN I LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT COMPASSION
JamesForbes_2009P OF COURSE IT WAS A MINISTER 'S FAMILY SO WE HAD TO ADD GOD INTO IT AND SO I CAME TO THINK THAT MAMA
JamesForbes_2009P ETERNAL MAMA ETERNAL IS ALWAYS WONDERING ARE ALL
JamesForbes_2009P THE CHILDREN IN AND IF WE HAD BEEN FAITHFUL IN CARING AND SHARING WE HAD
JamesForbes_2009P THE SENSE THAT JUSTICE AND PEACE WOULD HAVE A CHANCE IN THE WORLD NOW IT WAS NOT ALWAYS WONDERFUL AT THAT TABLE LET ME EXPLAIN A POINT AT WHICH WE DID NOT RISE TO THE OCCASION
JamesForbes_2009P IT WAS CHRISTMAS AND AT OUR FAMILY OH WHAT A MORNING CHRISTMAS MORNING WHERE WE OPEN UP OUR GIFTS WHERE WE HAVE SPECIAL PRAYERS AND WHERE WE GET TO THE OLD
JamesForbes_2009P UPRIGHT PIANO AND WE WOULD SING CAROLS IT WAS A VERY INTIMATE MOMENT IN FACT YOU COULD COME DOWN TO THE TREE TO GET YOUR GIFTS AND GET READY TO SING AND THEN GET
JamesForbes_2009P AND DADDY BROUGHT ELDER REVELS TO THE CHRISTMAS FAMILY CELEBRATION WE THOUGHT HE MUST BE OUT OF HIS MIND THIS IS
JamesForbes_2009P TIME THIS IS INTIMATE TIME THIS IS WHEN WE CAN JUST BE WHO WE ARE AND NOW WE HAVE THIS STUFFY BROTHER WITH HIS SHIRT AND TIE ON
JamesForbes_2009P WHILE WE ARE STILL IN OUR PJS WHY WOULD DADDY BRING ELDER REVELS ANY OTHER TIME BUT
JamesForbes_2009P NOT TO THE CHRISTMAS CELEBRATION AND MOM OVERHEARD US AS SAID WELL YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THIS CELEBRATION
JamesForbes_2009P IT IS THAT THIS IS A TIME WHERE YOU EXTEND THE CIRCLE OF LOVE THAT'S WHAT THE CELEBRATION IS ALL ABOUT IT'S TIME TO MAKE SPACE
JamesForbes_2009P TO SHARE THE ENJOYMENT OF LIFE IN A BELOVED COMMUNITY SO WE SUCKED UP
JamesForbes_2009P WAS NOT A WORD TO BE DEBATED
JamesForbes_2009P IT WAS A SENSIBILITY TO HOW
JamesForbes_2009P WE ARE TOGETHER WE ARE
JamesForbes_2009P SISTERS AND BROTHERS UNITED TOGETHER AND LIKE CHIEF SEATTLE SAID WE DID NOT SPIN THE WEB OF LIFE WE'RE ALL STRANDS IN IT AND WHATEVER WE DO TO THE WEB
JamesForbes_2009P WE DO TO OURSELVES NOW THAT'S COMPASSION SO LET ME TELL YOU I KIND OF LOOK AT THE WORLD THIS WAY I SEE PICTURES AND SOMETHING SAYS NOW THAT'S COMPASSION A HARVESTED FIELD OF GRAIN
JamesForbes_2009P WITH SOME GRAIN
JamesForbes_2009P THE CORNERS REMINDING ME OF THE HEBREW TRADITION THAT YOU MAY INDEED HARVEST BUT YOU MUST ALWAYS LEAVE SOME
JamesForbes_2009P ON THE EDGES JUST IN CASE THERE'S SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT HAD THE SHARE NECESSARY FOR GOOD NURTURE
JamesForbes_2009P TALK ABOUT A PICTURE OF COMPASSION I SEE ALWAYS IT STIRS MY HEART A PICTURE OF DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JR WALKING
JamesForbes_2009P YOUNG AND RABBI HESCHEL AND MAYBE THICH NHAT HANH AND SOME OF
JamesForbes_2009P OTHER SAINTS ASSEMBLED WALKING ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND GOING INTO SELMA JUST A PHOTOGRAPH ARM IN ARM FOR STRUGGLE SUFFERING
JamesForbes_2009P IN A COMMON HOPE THAT WE CAN BE BROTHERS AND SISTERS WITHOUT THE ACCIDENTS OF OUR BIRTH OR OUR ETHNICITY ROBBING US OF A SENSE OF UNITY
JamesForbes_2009P ANOTHER PICTURE HERE THIS ONE I REALLY DO LIKE THIS PICTURE WHEN DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING
JamesForbes_2009P WAS ASSASSINATED THAT DAY EVERYBODY IN MY COMMUNITY
JamesForbes_2009P WAS UPSET YOU HEARD ABOUT RIOTS
JamesForbes_2009P ALL ACROSS THE LAND BOBBY KENNEDY WAS SCHEDULED TO BRING AN INNER CITY MESSAGE
JamesForbes_2009P IN INDIANAPOLIS
JamesForbes_2009P THIS IS THE PICTURE THEY SAID IT 'S GOING TO BE TOO VOLATILE FOR YOU TO GO HE INSISTED I MUST GO SO SITTING ON A FLATBED TRUCK
JamesForbes_2009P ELDERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND BOBBY STANDS UP AND SAYS TO THE PEOPLE I HAVE BAD NEWS FOR YOU
JamesForbes_2009P ALMOST WISH TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENTER NOW INTO ACTIVITIES OF REVENGE BUT HE SAID WHAT I REALLY WANT YOU TO KNOW IS THAT I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
JamesForbes_2009P BECAUSE I HAD SOMEONE DEAR TO ME SNATCHED AWAY I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
JamesForbes_2009P AND HE SAID I HOPE THAT YOU WILL HAVE THE STRENGTH TO DO WHAT I DID I ALLOWED MY ANGER MY BITTERNESS MY GRIEF TO SIMMER
JamesForbes_2009P AND THEN I MADE UP MY MIND THAT I WAS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENT WORLD AND WE CAN DO THAT TOGETHER THAT'S A PICTURE COMPASSION I THINK I SEE IT
JamesForbes_2009P I SAW IT WHEN THE DALAI LAMA CAME TO THE RIVERSIDE CHURCH WHILE I WAS A PASTOR AND HE INVITED REPRESENTATIVES OF FAITH TRADITIONS FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD
JamesForbes_2009P HE ASKED THEM TO GIVE A MESSAGE AND THEY EACH READ IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE A CENTRAL AFFIRMATION AND THAT WAS SOME
JamesForbes_2009P VERSION OF THE GOLDEN RULE AS YOU WOULD THAT OTHERS WOULD DO UNTO YOU DO ALSO UNTO THEM
JamesForbes_2009P TWELVE IN THEIR ECCLESIASTICAL OR CULTURAL OR TRIBAL ATTIRE AFFIRMING ONE MESSAGE
JamesForbes_2009P WE ARE SO CONNECTED THAT WE MUST TREAT EACH OTHER AS IF AN ACTION TOWARD YOU IS AN ACTION TOWARD MYSELF
JamesForbes_2009P ONE MORE PICTURE WHILE I'M STINKING AND THINKING ABOUT THE RIVERSIDE CHURCH NINE ELEVEN LAST NIGHT
JamesForbes_2009P AT CHAGRIN FALL A NEWSPAPER MAN AND A TELEVISION GUY SAID THAT EVENING
JamesForbes_2009P WHEN A SERVICE WAS HELD AT THE RIVERSIDE CHURCH WE CARRIED IT ON OUR STATION IN THIS CITY
JamesForbes_2009P IT WAS HE SAID ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOMENTS OF LIFE TOGETHER WE WERE ALL SUFFERING
JamesForbes_2009P BUT YOU INVITED REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL OF THE TRADITIONS TO COME AND YOU INVITED THEM FIND OUT WHAT IT IS IN YOUR TRADITION THAT TELLS US WHAT TO DO
JamesForbes_2009P WHEN WE HAVE BEEN HUMILIATED WHEN WE HAVE BEEN DESPISED AND REJECTED AND THEY ALL SPOKE OUT OF THEIR OWN TRADITION
JamesForbes_2009P A WORD ABOUT THE HEALING POWER OF SOLIDARITY ONE WITH THE OTHER
JamesForbes_2009P AS A PREACHER I GOT A JOB I GOT TO PREACH
JamesForbes_2009P THE STUFF BUT I GOT TO DO IT TOO OR AS FATHER DIVINE IN HARLEM USED TO SAY TO FOLKS SOME PEOPLE PREACH THE GOSPEL
JamesForbes_2009P I HAVE TO TANGIBILITATE THE GOSPEL SO THE REAL ISSUE IS HOW DO YOU TANGIBILITATE
JamesForbes_2009P COMPASSION HOW DO YOU MAKE IT REAL MY FAITH HAS CONSTANTLY LIFTED UP THE IDEAL AND CHALLENGED ME WHEN I
JamesForbes_2009P BENEATH IT IN MY TRADITION THERE IS A GIFT THAT WE HAVE MADE TO OTHER TRADITIONS
JamesForbes_2009P AROUND THE WORLD WHO KNOWS THE STORY OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN MANY PEOPLE THINK OF IT PRIMARILY IN TERMS OF CHARITY
JamesForbes_2009P RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS BUT FOR THOSE WHO REALLY STUDY THAT TEXT A LITTLE MORE
JamesForbes_2009P THOROUGHLY YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT A QUESTION HAS BEEN RAISED THAT LEADS TO THIS PARABLE THE QUESTION WAS
JamesForbes_2009P WHAT IS THE GREATEST COMMANDMENT AND ACCORDING TO JESUS THE WORD COMES FORTH YOU MUST LOVE YOURSELF YOU MUST LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART MIND AND SOUL AND YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF
JamesForbes_2009P AND THEN THE PERSON ASKED WELL WHAT DO YOU MEAN NEIGHBOR AND HE ANSWERED
JamesForbes_2009P BY TELLING THE STORY OF THE MAN WHO FELL AMONG THIEVES AND HOW RELIGIOUS AUTHORITIES WENT THE OTHER WAY
JamesForbes_2009P AND HOW THEIR SUPPORTERS IN THE CONGREGATION WENT THE OTHER WAY BUT AN UNSUSPECTING DESPISED PERSON
JamesForbes_2009P CAME ALONG SAW THE MAN IN NEED PROVIDED OIL AND WINE FOR HIS WOUNDS PUT HIM ON HIS OWN
JamesForbes_2009P HE SAID HERE THIS IS THE INITIAL INVESTMENT BUT IF NEEDS CONTINUE MAKE SURE THAT YOU PROVIDE THEM AND WHATEVER ELSE IS NEEDED
JamesForbes_2009P I WILL PROVIDE IT AND PAY FOR IT WHEN I RETURN
JamesForbes_2009P THIS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME TO BE A DEEPENING OF THE SENSE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A GOOD SAMARITAN A GOOD SAMARITAN IS NOT SIMPLY ONE WHOSE HEART IS TOUCHED IN AN IMMEDIATE ACT OF CARE AND CHARITY
JamesForbes_2009P BUT ONE WHO PROVIDES A SYSTEM OF SUSTAINED CARE I LIKE THAT A SYSTEM
JamesForbes_2009P IN THE INN TAKE CARE I THINK MAYBE IT'S ONE TIME WHEN THE BIBLE TALKS ABOUT A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND A COMMITMENT TO DO
JamesForbes_2009P IS NECESSARY THAT ALL GOD 'S CHILDREN WOULD HAVE THEIR NEEDS CARED FOR SO THAT WE COULD ANSWER WHEN MOMMY ETERNAL ASKS IN REGARDS TO
JamesForbes_2009P AND WE COULD SAY YES OH WHAT A JOY IT HAS BEEN TO BE A PERSON SEEKING TO TANGIBILITATE
JamesForbes_2009P COMPASSION I RECALL THAT MY WORK AS A PASTOR HAS ALWAYS INVOLVED
JamesForbes_2009P CARING FOR THEIR SPIRITUAL NEEDS BEING CONCERNED FOR HOUSING FOR HEALTHCARE FOR THE PRISONERS FOR THE
JamesForbes_2009P FOR CHILDREN EVEN THE FOSTER CARE CHILDREN FOR WHOM NO ONE MAYBE CAN EVEN KEEP A RECORD WHERE THEY STARTED OFF WHERE THEY ARE GOING
JamesForbes_2009P TO BE A PASTOR IS TO CARE FOR THESE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS BUT NOW TO BE A GOOD SAMARITAN AND I ALWAYS SAY AND TO BE A GOOD AMERICAN FOR ME
JamesForbes_2009P IS NOT SIMPLY TO CONGRATULATE MYSELF FOR THE INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF CARE COMPASSION TAKES ON A CORPORATE DYNAMIC I BELIEVE THAT WHATEVER WE DID
JamesForbes_2009P THAT TABLE AT BLOODWORTH STREET MUST BE DONE AROUND TABLES AND RITUALS OF FAITH
JamesForbes_2009P UNTIL WE BECOME THAT FAMILY THAT FAMILY TOGETHER THAT UNDERSTANDS THE NATURE OF OUR UNITY WE ARE ONE PEOPLE TOGETHER
JamesForbes_2009P SO LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT I MEAN WHEN I THINK ABOUT COMPASSION AND WHY I THINK IT IS SO IMPORTANT
JamesForbes_2009P THAT RIGHT AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY WE WOULD DECIDE TO ESTABLISH THIS CHARTER OF COMPASSION THE REASON IT'S IMPORTANT
JamesForbes_2009P IS BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL TIME IN HISTORY
JamesForbes_2009P IT IS THE TIME WHICH BIBLICALLY WE WOULD SPEAK OF IT AS THE DAY OR THE YEAR OF GOD 'S FAVOR THIS IS A SEASON OF GRACE
JamesForbes_2009P THINGS ARE BEGINNING TO HAPPEN PLEASE PARDON ME AS A BLACK MAN FOR CELEBRATING THAT
JamesForbes_2009P THE ELECTION OF OBAMA WAS AN UNUSUAL SIGN OF THE FACT THAT IT IS A YEAR OF FAVOR
JamesForbes_2009P THERE IS SO MUCH MORE THAT
JamesForbes_2009P NEEDS TO BE DONE WE NEED TO BRING HEALTH AND FOOD AND EDUCATION AND RESPECT
JamesForbes_2009P FOR ALL GOD 'S CITIZENS ALL
JamesForbes_2009P CHILDREN REMEMBERING MAMA ETERNAL NOW LET ME CLOSE MY COMMENTS BY TELLING YOU THAT WHENEVER I FEEL SOMETHING VERY DEEPLY
JamesForbes_2009P IT USUALLY TAKES THE FORM OF VERSE AND SO I WANT TO CLOSE WITH A LITTLE SONG
JamesForbes_2009P I CLOSE WITH THIS SONG IT'S A CHILDREN 'S SONG BECAUSE WE ARE ALL CHILDREN AT THE TABLE OF MAMA ETERNAL AND IF MAMA
JamesForbes_2009P HAS TAUGHT US CORRECTLY THIS SONG WILL MAKE SENSE NOT ONLY TO THOSE OF US WHO ARE A PART OF THIS GATHERING BUT TO ALL WHO SIGN THE CHARTER FOR COMPASSION AND THIS IS WHY WE DO IT THE SONG SAYS A I
JamesForbes_2009P MADE HEAVEN SO HAPPY TODAY A A RECEIVING GOD 'S LOVE AND GIVING IT AWAY A A WHEN I LOOKED
JamesForbes_2009P ME A A NOW I'M SO HAPPY CAN'T
JamesForbes_2009P LOOK AT ME
