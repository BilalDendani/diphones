JohnWalker_2007P@17.07:18.40 OF US
JohnWalker_2007P@18.70:29.01 HAVE THE DREAM OF LISTENERS NOT BEING THE MUSICIANS THE LISTENERS RIGHT AND WE CRAVE ONE THING EVEN THOUGH WE KIND OF DON'T KNOW IT ALL THE TIME WE CRAVE TO BE IN THE ROOM
JohnWalker_2007P@30.49:39.33 WITH THE MUSICIAN THE DAY IT WAS RECORDED THE DAY IT WAS PLAYED AND WE GO TO LIVE CONCERTS AND WE GET THAT AS MUCH AS WE CAN BUT THEN WE LISTEN TO THE OTHER NINETY NINE PERCENT OF OUR STUFF RECORDED
JohnWalker_2007P@39.81:45.53 AND IT TURNS OUT THE FURTHER BACK YOU GO IN HISTORY THE LITTLE ROUGHER IT SOUNDS AND SO
JohnWalker_2007P@46.42:54.15 WE SAID THERE'S A SOLUTION TO THIS LET 'S SEPARATE THE PERFORMANCE AS A THING OUT FROM THE RECORDING
JohnWalker_2007P@54.36:65.07 WHICH WAS HOW IT WAS MADE YOU KNOW THE THING WITH MICROPHONES IN THE ROOM AND ALL THAT DAY BUT THE PERFORMANCE ITSELF WAS HOW THE MUSICIANS WORKED THEIR FINGERS AND WHAT INSTRUMENTS THEY WERE USING AND IT'S THE DATA
JohnWalker_2007P@66.29:77.52 HIDDEN INSIDE THE RECORDING IN ORDER TO DO THIS IT'S A LOT OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE THAT RUNS IN A VERY HIGH RESOLUTION AND YAMAHA MAKES AN INCREDIBLE THING CALLED THE DISKLAVIER PRO THAT
JohnWalker_2007P@78.13:86.60 LOOKS LIKE A NICE GRAND PIANO THERE AND YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T REALIZE IT'S GOING TO DO ALL THESE THINGS BUT FULL OF SOLENOIDS AND FIBER OPTICS AND COMPUTERS AND ALL THIS KINDS OF STUFF THE HIGHEST RESOLUTION OUT OF
JohnWalker_2007P@86.89:95.20 JAPAN AND THIS JUST DIDN'T WORK UNTIL WE COULD CROSS THIS LINE THAT SAYS HIGH DEFINITION AND WE WERE ABLE TO CROSS THIS LINE CALLED THE UNCANNY VALLEY IN TERMS OF
JohnWalker_2007P@106.51:117.58 AND ALL THE ATTRIBUTES OF THOSE NOTES HOW HARD THEY WERE STRUCK AND HOW THEY WERE HELD DOWN AND HOW YOU MOVE THE FINGERS SO WE HAD TO DEVELOP A WHOLE NEW SCIENCE OF HOW YOU MOVE YOUR FINGERS AND YOU KNOW IT'S A THING YOUR PIANO TEACHER TEACHES YOU
JohnWalker_2007P@134.90:147.37 SO HE STEPPED BACK AND DID NOTHING BUT THE CRAFTING OF HIS WORK AND GOULD 'S SPECIALTY WAS PLAYING BACH HIS MAYBE MOST FAMOUS RECORDING WAS SOMETHING CALLED THE GOLDBERG VARIATIONS BACH ONLY WROTE THEMES AND VARIATIONS ONE TIME
JohnWalker_2007P@148.04:156.68 EARLY PIECES BUT LATE IN HIS LIFE IN HIS MATURE PERIOD HE SAID HERE 'S A THEME THIRTY VARIATIONS IN FACT THE THEME ISN'T EVEN THE MELODY IT'S THE
JohnWalker_2007P@158.65:165.65 AND GOULD RECORDED IT IN TWO MAJOR RECORDINGS THAT YOU MAY KNOW ABOUT ONE IN MONO AND ONE IN STEREO AND THE ONE IN MONO BY THE WAY
JohnWalker_2007P@166.60:173.04 THE PEDAL AND AS HE GOT OLDER HE SAID NO NO WAIT A MINUTE I'M GOING TO GET VERY SCIENTIFIC ABOUT THIS AND NOT USE THE
JohnWalker_2007P@335.92:336.33 THAT
JohnWalker_2007P@341.73:355.09 A LITTLE BIT HOW THIS WAS DONE FIRST OF ALL LET ME GET YOU TO THE END STEP THIS IS WE HAVE A FAIRLY COMPLEX PROCESS THAT YOU KNOW SOFTWARE AND MUSICIANS AND SO ON BUT WHEN WE'RE ALL DONE WE KNOW THAT THE EAR IS THE FINAL ARBITER
JohnWalker_2007P@355.42:363.88 WE CAN PLAY THE ORIGINAL IN ONE EAR AND A NEW RECORDING IN THE OTHER SO I'M GOING TO DO THIS FOR YOU RIGHT NOW WHAT YOU JUST HEARD AND IN THE RIGHT SPEAKER IS GOING TO BE THE ORIGINAL RECORDING
JohnWalker_2007P@364.35:371.49 THE LEFT SPEAKER IS GOING TO BE THE NEW RECORDING ACTUALLY OF AN INSTRUMENT JUST LIKE THAT ONE AND I'M GOING TO PLAY THEM TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME
JohnWalker_2007P@416.31:421.88 JURASSIC PARK THERE WAS NO SCIENCE FOR HOW SKIN HUNG OFF OF MUSCLE
JohnWalker_2007P@422.86:432.39 RIGHT SO IN THE VIDEO WORLD WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO INVENT IN OUR LIFETIMES NATURAL BEHAVIOR AND THIS IS KIND OF ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF PUTTING A SCIENCE BEHIND NATURAL BEHAVIOR
JohnWalker_2007P@432.83:441.83 AND THEN YOU HEARD THE ORIGINAL ULTIMATELY I STARTED WITH THE EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPERIENCE IS I WANT TO BE IN THE ROOM AND HEAR THE MUSICIANS LOTS OF YOU CAN AFFORD TO BUY ONE OF THESE
JohnWalker_2007P@444.80:447.12 IF NOT THERE IS NOW
JohnWalker_2007P@460.41:472.10 AND SO ON THE SAME DISK WE HAVE FIVE RECORDINGS SONY HAS FIVE RECORDINGS AND YOU COULD LISTEN IN HEADPHONES WITH THIS THING CALLED BINAURAL RECORDING AND IT'S A DUMMY HEAD THAT SITS IN FRONT OF THE INSTRUMENT
JohnWalker_2007P@473.58:484.73 IT'S GOT MICROPHONES WHERE THE EARS ARE AND WHEN YOU PUT ON HEADPHONES AND YOU LISTEN TO THIS YOU'RE INSIDE OF GLENN GOULD 'S BODY AND IT IS A CHUCKLE UNTIL YOU KNOW THE MUSICIANS WHO ARE MUSICIANS WHO PLAY THE PIANO
JohnWalker_2007P@485.30:494.42 I CAN'T BELIEVE IT IT'S JUST WHAT IT'S LIKE TO PLAY THE PIANO EXCEPT NOW YOU'RE INSIDE GLENN GOULD 'S BODY PLAYING THE PIANO AND IT FEELS LIKE YOUR FINGERS ARE MAKING THE DECISIONS AND MOVING THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS IT'S A GAME CHANGER HERE 'S NOW
JohnWalker_2007P@494.74:503.79 SOMETHING WE KNOW IN SPECTACULAR QUALITY THE WHOLE PROCESS IS VERY SENSITIVE TO TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY WHAT YOU HEARD TODAY WAS NOT PERFECT IT'S
JohnWalker_2007P@504.02:512.25 AN AMALGAM OF WOOD AND CAST IRON AND FELT AND STEEL STRINGS AND ALL THESE AND THEY'RE ALL AMAZINGLY SENSITIVE TO
JohnWalker_2007P@513.58:528.13 SO WHEN YOU GO INTO THE RECORDING SESSION YOU GET TO STOP AFTER EVERY PIECE AND REBUILD THE PIANO IF YOU NEED TO THERE'S THE WHOLE ACTION THERE SITTING KIND OF ON THE SIDE AND THE DUMMY HEAD AND OUR RECORDING ENGINEERS STANDING AROUND WHILE WE REBUILD THE PIANO WITHOUT PUTTING DATES NEXT TO THESE THINGS STEP BY STEP
JohnWalker_2007P@528.51:534.37 MUSIC WILL BE TURNED INTO DATA LIKE EVERY FIELD THAT'S OCCURRED IN THE PAST THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY YEARS
JohnWalker_2007P@534.92:548.53 AUDIO HAS COME VERY LATE TO THIS GAME I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT DIGITIZING AND BITS AND RE MASTERING I'M TALKING ABOUT TURN IT INTO THE DATA THAT IT WAS MADE FROM WHICH IS HOW IT WAS PERFORMED AND AUDIO CAME VERY LATE BECAUSE OUR EARS ARE SO HARD TO FOOL
JohnWalker_2007P@549.05:559.60 HIGH RESOLUTION AND THEY'RE WIRED STRAIGHT TO OUR EMOTIONS AND YOU CAN'T TRICK THEM VERY EASILY YOUR EYES ARE PRETTY HAPPY WITH SOME COLOR AND MOVEMENT YOU KNOW ALL RIGHT THERE'S THIS EPISODE OF STAR TREK
JohnWalker_2007P@591.64:591.83 THE
JohnWalker_2007P@597.78:600.02 I WANT TO HEAR THE WALTZES BRAHMS DIDN'T WRITE
JohnWalker_2007P@601.76:605.46 I WANT TO HEAR THE PIECES THAT HOROWITZ DIDN'T PLAY
JohnWalker_2007P@606.03:610.87 BUT I BELIEVE WE'RE ON A PATH NOW WHEN WE GET TO DATA THAT WE CAN DISTILL
JohnWalker_2007P@611.85:622.32 STYLES AND TEMPLATES AND FORMULAS AND ALL THESE KINDS OF THINGS AGAIN THAT YOU'VE SEEN HAPPEN IN THE COMPUTER GRAPHICS WORLD IT'S NOW COMING IN THIS WORLD THE TRANSITION WILL BE THIS ONE IT SAYS RIGHT NOW WE THINK MUSIC IS NOTES AND HOW
JohnWalker_2007P@624.30:625.97 I BELIEVE THIS IS COMING
JohnWalker_2007P@626.71:636.84 BECAUSE WHAT YOU'VE JUST HEARD WAS A COMPUTER PLAYING DATA NO GLENN GOULD IN THE ROOM BUT YET IT WAS HUMAN AND I BELIEVE YOU'LL GET TO THE NEXT STEP THE REAL DREAM OF
JohnWalker_2007P@646.46:651.98 IT'S FROZEN WOULDN'T IT BE COOL IF EVERY TIME YOU LISTENED IT COULD BE DIFFERENT
JohnWalker_2007P@652.36:664.30 THIS MORNING YOU'RE SADDER YOU WANT TO HEAR YOUR SONG THE SAME SONG PLAYED SADDER THAN YOU DID YESTERDAY YOU WANT TO HEAR IT PLAYED BY DIFFERENT MUSICIANS YOU WANT TO HEAR IT IN DIFFERENT ROOMS AND WHATEVER WE'VE SEEN ALL THESE STAR TREKS AND THEY'RE ALL HOLODECK EPISODES AS WELL EVERY TIME
JohnWalker_2007P@665.47:665.59 I

JohnWalker_2007P@726.83:736.67 AND EVERY NOTE EVERY BEAT EVERY SLUR EVERY ACCENT EVERY PEDAL WAS PERFECT BECAUSE HE PLAYED IT FOR THAT ROOM ON THAT DAY AND WE CAPTURED ALL THAT DATA ALL OVER AGAIN
