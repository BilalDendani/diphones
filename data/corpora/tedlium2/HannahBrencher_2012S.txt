HannahBrencher_2012S@15.8:20.54 ONE OF THE ONLY KIDS IN COLLEGE WHO HAD A REASON TO GO TO THE P O BOX AT THE END OF THE DAY
HannahBrencher_2012S@20.54:38.58 AND THAT WAS MAINLY BECAUSE MY MOTHER HAS NEVER BELIEVED IN EMAIL IN FACEBOOK IN TEXTING OR CELL PHONES IN GENERAL AND SO WHILE OTHER KIDS WERE BBM ING THEIR PARENTS I WAS LITERALLY WAITING BY THE MAILBOX TO GET A LETTER FROM HOME TO SEE HOW THE WEEKEND HAD GONE WHICH WAS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING WHEN GRANDMA WAS IN THE HOSPITAL BUT
HannahBrencher_2012S@38.58:44.21 I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR SOME SORT OF SCRIBBLE SOME UNKEMPT CURSIVE FROM MY MOTHER
HannahBrencher_2012S@65.97:78.01 I BLOGGED ABOUT THOSE LETTERS AND THE DAYS WHEN THEY WERE NECESSARY AND I POSED A KIND OF CRAZY PROMISE TO THE INTERNET THAT IF YOU ASKED ME FOR A HAND WRITTEN LETTER I WOULD WRITE YOU ONE NO QUESTIONS ASKED
HannahBrencher_2012S@78.01:91.67 OVERNIGHT MY INBOX MORPHED INTO THIS HARBOR OF HEARTBREAK A SINGLE MOTHER IN SACRAMENTO A GIRL BEING BULLIED IN RURAL KANSAS ALL ASKING ME A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD GIRL WHO BARELY EVEN KNEW HER OWN COFFEE ORDER
HannahBrencher_2012S@91.67:102.09 TO WRITE THEM A LOVE LETTER AND GIVE THEM A REASON TO WAIT BY THE MAILBOX WELL TODAY I FUEL A GLOBAL ORGANIZATION THAT IS FUELED BY THOSE TRIPS TO THE MAILBOX
HannahBrencher_2012S@114.41:127.44 FILLED WITH THE SCRIPTINGS OF ORDINARY PEOPLE STRANGERS WRITING LETTERS TO OTHER STRANGERS NOT BECAUSE THEY 'RE EVER GOING TO MEET AND LAUGH OVER A CUP OF COFFEE BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE FOUND ONE ANOTHER BY WAY OF LETTER WRITING
HannahBrencher_2012S@127.72:133.66 BUT YOU KNOW THE THING THAT ALWAYS GETS ME ABOUT THESE LETTERS IS THAT MOST OF THEM HAVE BEEN WRITTEN
HannahBrencher_2012S@133.74:137.25 PEOPLE THAT HAVE NEVER KNOWN THEMSELVES LOVED ON A PIECE OF PAPER
HannahBrencher_2012S@151.96:158.28 WE HAVE LEARNED TO DIARY OUR PAIN ONTO FACEBOOK AND WE SPEAK SWIFTLY IN ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY CHARACTERS OR LESS
HannahBrencher_2012S@158.28:175.66 BUT WHAT IF IT 'S NOT ABOUT EFFICIENCY THIS TIME I WAS ON THE SUBWAY YESTERDAY WITH THIS MAIL CRATE WHICH IS A CONVERSATION STARTER LET ME TELL YOU IF YOU EVER NEED ONE JUST CARRY ONE OF THESE LAUGHTER AND A MAN JUST STARED AT ME AND HE WAS LIKE WELL WHY DON 'T YOU USE THE INTERNET AND I THOUGHT WELL SIR
HannahBrencher_2012S@175.94:181.26 I AM NOT A STRATEGIST NOR AM I SPECIALIST I AM MERELY A STORYTELLER
HannahBrencher_2012S@181.26:196.51 AND SO I COULD TELL YOU ABOUT A WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND HAS JUST COME HOME FROM AFGHANISTAN AND SHE IS HAVING A HARD TIME UNEARTHING THIS THING CALLED CONVERSATION AND SO SHE TUCKS LOVE LETTERS THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE AS A WAY TO SAY COME BACK TO ME FIND ME WHEN YOU CAN
HannahBrencher_2012S@196.51:212.05 OR A GIRL WHO DECIDES THAT SHE IS GOING TO LEAVE LOVE LETTERS AROUND HER CAMPUS IN DUBUQUE IOWA ONLY TO FIND HER EFFORTS RIPPLE EFFECTED THE NEXT DAY WHEN SHE WALKS OUT ONTO THE QUAD AND FINDS LOVE LETTERS HANGING FROM THE TREES TUCKED IN THE BUSHES AND THE BENCHES
HannahBrencher_2012S@212.05:215.27 OR THE MAN WHO DECIDES THAT HE IS GOING TO TAKE HIS LIFE
HannahBrencher_2012S@215.27:228.47 USES FACEBOOK AS A WAY TO SAY GOODBYE TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY WELL TONIGHT HE SLEEPS SAFELY WITH A STACK OF LETTERS JUST LIKE THIS ONE TUCKED BENEATH HIS PILLOW SCRIPTED BY STRANGERS WHO WERE THERE FOR HIM WHEN
HannahBrencher_2012S@243.74:259.28 THE MERE FACT THAT SOMEBODY WOULD EVEN JUST SIT DOWN PULL OUT A PIECE OF PAPER AND THINK ABOUT SOMEONE THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH WITH AN INTENTION THAT IS SO MUCH HARDER TO UNEARTH WHEN THE BROWSER IS UP AND THE IPHONE IS PINGING AND WE 'VE GOT SIX CONVERSATIONS ROLLING IN AT ONCE THAT IS AN ART FORM
HannahBrencher_2012S@259.28:267.93 THAT DOES NOT FALL DOWN TO THE GOLIATH OF GET FASTER NO MATTER HOW MANY SOCIAL NETWORKS WE MIGHT JOIN WE STILL CLUTCH CLOSE THESE LETTERS TO OUR CHEST
