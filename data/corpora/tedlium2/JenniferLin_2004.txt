JenniferLin_2004 THANK YOU VERY MUCH LIKE THE SPEAKER BEFORE ME I AM THAT'S THE TED VIRGIN I GUESS I'M ALSO THE FIRST TIME HERE AND
JenniferLin_2004 I HAVE ANOTHER PIECE THAT I'D LIKE TO PLAY FOR YOU IT'S CALLED ABEGG VARIATIONS BY ROBERT SCHUMANN A GERMAN NINETEENTH CENTURY COMPOSER
JenniferLin_2004 THE NAME ABEGG ABEGG IS ACTUALLY A B E G G AND THAT'S THE MAIN THEME IN THE MELODY
JenniferLin_2004 THAT COMES FROM THE LAST NAME OF ONE OF SCHUMANN 'S FEMALE FRIENDS
JenniferLin_2004 BUT HE WROTE THAT FOR HIS WIFE
JenniferLin_2004 NOW COMES THE PART THAT
JenniferLin_2004 BECAUSE MISTER ANDERSON TOLD ME THAT THIS SESSION IS CALLED SYNC AND FLOW I WAS WONDERING WHAT DO I KNOW THAT THESE GENIUSES DON
JenniferLin_2004 SO I'LL TALK ABOUT MUSICAL COMPOSITION EVEN THOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START HOW DO I COMPOSE I THINK YAMAHA DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB OF TEACHING US HOW TO COMPOSE
JenniferLin_2004 WHAT I DO FIRST IS I MAKE A LOT OF LITTLE MUSICAL IDEAS YOU CAN JUST IMPROVISE HERE AT THE PIANO AND I CHOOSE ONE OF THOSE TO BECOME MY MAIN THEME MY MAIN MELODY LIKE THE ABEGG THAT YOU JUST HEARD
JenniferLin_2004 AND ONCE I CHOOSE MY MAIN THEME I HAVE TO DECIDE OUT OF ALL THE STYLES IN MUSIC WHAT KIND OF STYLE DO I
JenniferLin_2004 AND THIS YEAR I COMPOSED A ROMANTIC STYLE SO FOR INSPIRATION I LISTENED TO LISZT AND TCHAIKOVSKY AND ALL THE GREAT ROMANTIC COMPOSERS
JenniferLin_2004 NEXT I MAKE THE STRUCTURE OF THE ENTIRE PIECE WITH MY TEACHERS THEY HELP ME PLAN OUT THE WHOLE PIECE AND THEN THE HARD PART IS FILLING IT IN WITH MUSICAL IDEAS BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE TO THINK
JenniferLin_2004 AND THEN WHEN THE PIECE TAKES SOMEWHAT OF A SOLIFIED FORM SOLIDIFIED EXCUSE ME SOLIDIFIED FORM YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
JenniferLin_2004 AND ANOTHER THING THAT I ENJOY DOING IS DRAWING DRAWING BECAUSE I LIKE TO DRAW YOU KNOW JAPANESE ANIME ART I THINK THAT'S A CRAZE AMONG TEENS RIGHT NOW
JenniferLin_2004 AND ONCE I REALIZED IT THERE'S A PARALLEL BETWEEN CREATING MUSIC AND CREATING ART BECAUSE FOR YOUR MOTIVE OR YOUR
JenniferLin_2004 LIKE AM I GOING TO USE ONE PAGE AM I GOING TO DRAW IT ON THE COMPUTER AM I GOING TO USE A TWO PAGE SPREAD LIKE A COMIC BOOK FOR MORE GRANDIOSE EFFECT I GUESS
JenniferLin_2004 AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DO THE INITIAL SKETCH OF THE CHARACTER WHICH IS LIKE YOUR STRUCTURE OF A PIECE AND THEN YOU ADD PEN AND PENCIL AND WHATEVER DETAILS THAT YOU NEED THAT'S POLISHING THE DRAWING
JenniferLin_2004 AND ANOTHER THING THAT BOTH OF THESE HAVE IN COMMON IS YOUR STATE OF MIND BECAUSE I DON'T I'M ONE OF THOSE TEENAGERS THAT ARE REALLY EASILY DISTRACTED SO
JenniferLin_2004 I'M TRYING TO DO HOMEWORK
JenniferLin_2004 I'M TRYING TO DO HOMEWORK AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT I'LL TRY TO DRAW OR YOU KNOW WASTE MY TIME
JenniferLin_2004 AND SOMETIMES IF YOU MANAGE TO USE YOUR TIME WISELY AND WORK ON IT YOU'LL GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT BUT IT DOESN'T COME NATURALLY
JenniferLin_2004 WHAT HAPPENS IS IF SOMETHING MAGICAL HAPPENS IF SOMETHING NATURAL HAPPENS TO YOU YOU'RE ABLE TO PRODUCE ALL THIS BEAUTIFUL STUFF INSTANTLY
JenniferLin_2004 AND THEN THAT'S WHAT I CONSIDER FLOW BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN EVERYTHING CLICKS AND YOU'RE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ON TOP OF YOUR GAME AND YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT
JenniferLin_2004 I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY MY OWN COMPOSITION TODAY BECAUSE ALTHOUGH I DID FINISH IT IT'S WAY TOO LONG INSTEAD I'D LIKE TO TRY SOMETHING CALLED IMPROVISATION
JenniferLin_2004 I HAVE HERE SEVEN NOTE CARDS ONE WITH EACH NOTE OF THE MUSICAL ALPHABET AND I'D LIKE SOMEONE TO COME UP HERE AND CHOOSE FIVE
JenniferLin_2004 COME UP HERE AND CHOOSE FIVE AND THEN I CAN MAKE IT INTO SOME SORT OF MELODY AND I'LL IMPROVISE IT
JenniferLin_2004 YES FIVE CARDS ANY FIVE CARDS
JenniferLin_2004 OK
JenniferLin_2004 D AND F TOO FAMILIAR
JenniferLin_2004 WOULD YOU MIND READING THEM OUT IN THE ORDER THAT YOU CHOSE THEM GH OK
JenniferLin_2004 YOU VERY MUCH GH YOU'RE WELCOME AND WHAT ABOUT THESE
JenniferLin_2004 NOW SHE CHOSE C G B A E I'M GOING TO TRY TO PUT THAT IN SOME SORT OF ORDER
JenniferLin_2004 OK THAT'S NICE SO I'M GOING TO HAVE A MOMENT TO THINK AND I'LL TRY TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF IT
