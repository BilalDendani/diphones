DavedeBronkart_2010X@22.09:35.99 YOU HEARD STORIES EARLIER TODAY ABOUT PATIENTS WHO ARE TAKING CONTROL OF THEIR CASES PATIENTS WHO ARE SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW WHAT THE ODDS ARE BUT I 'M GOING TO GO LOOK FOR MORE INFORMATION I 'M GOING TO DEFINE WHAT THE TERMS OF MY SUCCESS ARE
DavedeBronkart_2010X@36.02:39.71 I 'M GOING TO BE SHARING WITH YOU HOW FOUR YEARS AGO I ALMOST DIED
DavedeBronkart_2010X@39.77:55.81 FOUND OUT I WAS IN FACT ALREADY ALMOST DEAD AND WHAT I THEN FOUND OUT ABOUT WHAT 'S CALLED THE E PATIENT MOVEMENT I 'LL EXPLAIN WHAT THAT TERM MEANS I HAD BEEN BLOGGING UNDER THE NAME PATIENT DAVE AND WHEN I DISCOVERED THIS I JUST RENAMED MYSELF E PATIENT DAVE
DavedeBronkart_2010X@55.81:68.67 REGARDING THE WORD PATIENT WHEN I FIRST STARTED A FEW YEARS AGO GETTING INVOLVED IN HEALTH CARE AND ATTENDING MEETINGS AS JUST A CASUAL OBSERVER I NOTICED THAT PEOPLE WOULD TALK ABOUT PATIENTS AS IF IT WAS SOMEBODY WHO 'S NOT IN THE ROOM HERE
DavedeBronkart_2010X@68.68:72.56 SOMEBODY OUT THERE SOME OF OUR TALKS TODAY WE STILL ACT LIKE THAT
DavedeBronkart_2010X@72.65:77.46 BUT I 'M HERE TO TELL YOU PATIENT IS NOT A THIRD PERSON WORD
DavedeBronkart_2010X@77.89:79.96 YOU YOURSELF
DavedeBronkart_2010X@104.97:116.35 ONE OF THE SENIOR DOCTORS AT MY HOSPITAL CHARLIE SAFRAN AND HIS COLLEAGUE WARNER SLACK HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR DECADES THAT THE MOST UNDERUTILIZED RESOURCE IN ALL OF HEALTH CARE IS THE PATIENT
DavedeBronkart_2010X@116.35:135.61 THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT SINCE THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY S NOW I 'M GOING TO STEP BACK IN HISTORY THIS IS FROM JULY ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE I WAS A FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE AND THIS WAS WHEN WE FIRST LANDED ON THE MOON AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE HAD EVER SEEN FROM ANOTHER SURFACE THAT 'S THE PLACE WHERE YOU AND I ARE RIGHT NOW WHERE WE LIVE
DavedeBronkart_2010X@135.61:143.63 THE WORLD WAS CHANGING IT WAS ABOUT TO CHANGE IN WAYS THAT NOBODY COULD FORESEE A FEW WEEKS LATER WOODSTOCK HAPPENED
DavedeBronkart_2010X@144.47:150.81 THREE DAYS OF FUN AND MUSIC HERE JUST FOR HISTORICAL AUTHENTICITY IS A PICTURE OF ME IN THAT YEAR
DavedeBronkart_2010X@157.3:171.21 THAT FALL OF ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE THE WHOLE EARTH CATALOG CAME OUT IT WAS A HIPPIE JOURNAL OF SELF SUFFICIENCY WE THINK OF HIPPIES OF BEING JUST HEDONISTS BUT THERE 'S A VERY STRONG COMPONENT I WAS IN THAT MOVEMENT
DavedeBronkart_2010X@171.21:183.17 A VERY STRONG COMPONENT OF BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR YOURSELF THIS BOOK 'S TITLE 'S SUBTITLE IS ACCESS TO TOOLS AND IT TALKED ABOUT HOW TO BUILD YOUR OWN HOUSE HOW TO GROW YOUR OWN FOOD ALL KINDS OF THINGS
DavedeBronkart_2010X@183.17:186.77 IN THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY S THIS YOUNG DOCTOR TOM FERGUSON
DavedeBronkart_2010X@186.77:200.64 WAS THE MEDICAL EDITOR OF THE WHOLE EARTH CATALOG AND HE SAW THAT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF WHAT WE DO IN MEDICINE AND HEALTH CARE IS TAKING CARE OF OURSELVES IN FACT HE SAID IT WAS SEVENTY TO EIGHTY PERCENT OF HOW WE ACTUALLY TAKE CARE OF OUR BODIES
DavedeBronkart_2010X@200.64:212.8 WELL HE ALSO SAW THAT WHEN HEALTH CARE TURNS TO MEDICAL CARE BECAUSE OF A MORE SERIOUS DISEASE THE KEY THING THAT HOLDS US BACK IS ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND WHEN THE WEB CAME ALONG
DavedeBronkart_2010X@212.95:228.25 THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING BECAUSE NOT ONLY COULD WE FIND INFORMATION WE COULD FIND OTHER PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES WHO COULD GATHER WHO COULD BRING US INFORMATION AND HE COINED THIS TERM E PATIENTS EQUIPPED ENGAGED EMPOWERED ENABLED OBVIOUSLY AT THIS STAGE
DavedeBronkart_2010X@232.47:249.63 NOW I WAS AN ENGAGED PATIENT LONG BEFORE I EVER HEARD OF THE TERM IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX I WENT TO MY DOCTOR FOR A REGULAR PHYSICAL AND I HAD SAID I HAVE A SORE SHOULDER WELL I GOT AN X RAY AND THE NEXT MORNING YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH A MEDICAL CRISIS WILL UNDERSTAND THIS
DavedeBronkart_2010X@249.63:255.57 THIS MORNING SOME OF THE SPEAKERS NAMED THE DATE WHEN THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT THEIR CONDITION
DavedeBronkart_2010X@255.58:257.84 FOR ME IT WAS NINE ZERO AM
DavedeBronkart_2010X@258.08:269.31 ON JANUARY THREE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN I WAS AT THE OFFICE MY DESK WAS CLEAN I HAD THE BLUE PARTITION CARPET ON THE WALLS THE PHONE RANG AND IT WAS MY DOCTOR
DavedeBronkart_2010X@269.61:282.16 HE SAID DAVE I PULLED UP THE X RAY IMAGE ON THE SCREEN ON THE COMPUTER AT HOME HE SAID YOUR SHOULDER 'S GOING TO BE FINE BUT DAVE THERE 'S SOMETHING IN YOUR LUNG AND IF YOU LOOK IN THAT RED OVAL THAT SHADOW
DavedeBronkart_2010X@295.6:301.23 THINK ABOUT THIS ONE THIS IS THE ADVICE YOUR DOCTOR GIVES YOU JUST GO HOME AND HAVE A GLASS OF WINE WITH YOUR WIFE
DavedeBronkart_2010X@302.37:307.32 I WENT IN FOR THE CAT SCAN
DavedeBronkart_2010X@307.32:317.45 AND IT TURNS OUT THERE WERE FIVE OF THESE THINGS IN BOTH MY LUNGS SO AT THAT POINT WE KNEW THAT IT WAS CANCER WE KNEW IT WASN 'T LUNG CANCER THAT MEANT IT WAS METASTASIZED FROM SOMEWHERE
DavedeBronkart_2010X@318.09:319.92 THE QUESTION WAS WHERE FROM
DavedeBronkart_2010X@320.27:336.76 SO I WENT IN FOR AN ULTRASOUND I GOT TO DO WHAT MANY WOMEN HAVE THE JELLY ON THE BELLY AND BZZZZ MY WIFE CAME WITH ME SHE 'S A VETERINARIAN SO SHE 'S SEEN LOTS OF ULTRASOUNDS I MEAN SHE KNOWS I 'M NOT A DOG BUT
DavedeBronkart_2010X@361.58:377.05 I WENT HOME NOW I 'VE BEEN GOOGLING I 'VE BEEN ONLINE SINCE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE ON COMPUSERVE I WENT HOME AND I KNOW YOU CAN 'T READ THE DETAILS HERE THAT 'S NOT IMPORTANT MY POINT IS I WENT TO A RESPECTED MEDICAL WEBSITE WEBMD BECAUSE I KNOW HOW TO FILTER OUT JUNK
DavedeBronkart_2010X@402.17:421.94 WHERE DOES MEDICAL ABILITY END AND START WELL SO WHAT I READ ON WEBMD THE PROGNOSIS IS POOR FOR PROGRESSING RENAL CELL CANCER ALMOST ALL PATIENTS ARE INCURABLE I 'VE BEEN ONLINE LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW IF I DON 'T LIKE THE FIRST RESULTS I GET I GO LOOK FOR MORE
DavedeBronkart_2010X@422.08:428.91 AND WHAT I FOUND WAS ON OTHER WEBSITES EVEN BY THE THIRD PAGE OF GOOGLE RESULTS OUTLOOK IS BLEAK
DavedeBronkart_2010X@429.35:431.4 PROGNOSIS IS GRIM
DavedeBronkart_2010X@431.93:433.66 AND I 'M THINKING WHAT
DavedeBronkart_2010X@434.03:444.46 I DIDN 'T FEEL SICK AT ALL I MEAN I 'D BEEN GETTING TIRED IN THE EVENING BUT I WAS FIFTY SIX YEARS OLD I WAS SLOWLY LOSING WEIGHT BUT FOR ME THAT WAS WHAT THE DOCTOR TOLD ME TO DO
DavedeBronkart_2010X@455.76:459.69 IN THE LEFT FEMUR THE LEFT THIGH BONE THERE 'S ANOTHER ONE I HAD ONE
DavedeBronkart_2010X@459.7:477.75 MY LEG EVENTUALLY SNAPPED I FAINTED AND LANDED ON IT AND IT BROKE THERE 'S ONE IN THE SKULL AND THEN JUST FOR GOOD MEASURE I HAD THESE OTHER TUMORS INCLUDING BY THE TIME MY TREATMENT STARTED ONE WAS GROWING OUT OF MY TONGUE I HAD KIDNEY CANCER GROWING OUT OF MY TONGUE AND WHAT I READ WAS THAT MY MEDIAN SURVIVAL WAS TWENTY FOUR WEEKS
DavedeBronkart_2010X@482.03:498.73 I THOUGHT WHAT 'S MY MOTHER 'S FACE GOING TO LOOK LIKE ON THE DAY OF MY FUNERAL I HAD TO SIT DOWN WITH MY DAUGHTER AND SAY HERE 'S THE SITUATION HER BOYFRIEND WAS WITH HER I SAID I DON 'T WANT YOU GUYS TO GET MARRIED PREMATURELY JUST SO YOU CAN DO IT WHILE DAD 'S STILL ALIVE
DavedeBronkart_2010X@498.84:501.85 IT 'S REALLY SERIOUS
DavedeBronkart_2010X@519.76:526.22 THERE IS NO CURE BUT THERE 'S SOMETHING THAT SOMETIMES WORKS IT USUALLY DOESN 'T CALLED HIGH DOSAGE INTERLEUKIN
DavedeBronkart_2010X@526.22:539.33 MOST HOSPITALS DON 'T OFFER IT SO THEY WON 'T EVEN TELL YOU IT EXISTS AND DON 'T LET THEM GIVE YOU ANYTHING ELSE FIRST AND BY THE WAY HERE ARE FOUR DOCTORS IN YOUR PART OF THE UNITED STATES WHO OFFER IT AND THEIR PHONE NUMBERS HOW AMAZING IS THAT
DavedeBronkart_2010X@543.41:549.64 HERE 'S THE THING HERE WE ARE FOUR YEARS LATER YOU CAN 'T FIND A WEBSITE THAT GIVES PATIENTS THAT INFORMATION
DavedeBronkart_2010X@549.71:565.84 GOVERNMENT APPROVED AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY BUT PATIENTS KNOW WHAT PATIENTS WANT TO KNOW IT 'S THE POWER OF PATIENT NETWORKS THIS AMAZING SUBSTANCE AGAIN I MENTIONED WHERE DOES MY BODY END MY ONCOLOGIST AND I TALK A LOT THESE DAYS
DavedeBronkart_2010X@565.84:579.71 BECAUSE I TRY TO KEEP MY TALKS TECHNICALLY ACCURATE AND HE SAID YOU KNOW THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS GOOD AT DETECTING INVADERS BACTERIA COMING FROM OUTSIDE BUT WHEN IT 'S YOUR OWN TISSUE THAT YOU 'VE GROWN IT 'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING
DavedeBronkart_2010X@579.71:587.43 AND I WENT THROUGH A MENTAL EXERCISE ACTUALLY BECAUSE I STARTED A PATIENT SUPPORT COMMUNITY OF MY OWN ON A WEBSITE
DavedeBronkart_2010X@618.6:627.38 TWO MONTHS APART AND LOOK AT HOW THE TUMOR SIZES PLUMMETED IN BETWEEN JUST INCREDIBLE WHO KNOWS WHAT WE 'LL BE ABLE TO DO WHEN WE LEARN TO MAKE MORE USE OF IT
DavedeBronkart_2010X@634.48:637.32 GOT MARRIED AND WHEN SHE CAME DOWN THOSE STEPS
DavedeBronkart_2010X@638.01:643.53 AND IT WAS JUST HER AND ME FOR THAT MOMENT I WAS SO GLAD THAT SHE DIDN 'T HAVE TO SAY TO HER MOTHER
DavedeBronkart_2010X@643.56:649.59 I WISH DAD COULD HAVE BEEN HERE AND THIS IS WHAT WE 'RE DOING WHEN WE MAKE HEALTH CARE BETTER
DavedeBronkart_2010X@649.59:665.96 NOW I WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT A COUPLE OF OTHER PATIENTS WHO ARE DOING EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE THIS IS REGINA HOLLIDAY A PAINTER IN WASHINGTON D C WHOSE HUSBAND DIED OF KIDNEY CANCER A YEAR AFTER MY DISEASE SHE 'S PAINTING HERE A MURAL OF HIS HORRIBLE
DavedeBronkart_2010X@665.96:670.09 FINAL WEEKS IN THE HOSPITAL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHE DISCOVERED
DavedeBronkart_2010X@670.26:687.05 WAS THAT HER HUSBAND 'S MEDICAL RECORD IN THIS PAPER FOLDER WAS JUST DISORGANIZED AND SHE THOUGHT YOU KNOW IF I HAVE A NUTRITION FACTS LABEL ON THE SIDE OF A CEREAL BOX WHY CAN 'T THERE BE SOMETHING THAT SIMPLE TELLING EVERY NEW NURSE WHO COMES ON DUTY EVERY NEW DOCTOR
DavedeBronkart_2010X@687.05:691.7 THE BASICS ABOUT MY HUSBAND 'S CONDITION SO SHE PAINTED THIS MEDICAL FACTS MURAL
DavedeBronkart_2010X@695.69:712.09 OF HIM SHE THEN LAST YEAR PAINTED THIS DIAGRAM SHE STUDIED HEALTH CARE LIKE ME SHE CAME TO REALIZE THAT THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO 'D WRITTEN PATIENT ADVOCATE BOOKS THAT YOU JUST DON 'T HEAR ABOUT AT MEDICAL CONFERENCES PATIENTS ARE SUCH AN UNDERUTILIZED RESOURCE
DavedeBronkart_2010X@712.09:720.52 WELL AS IT SAYS IN MY INTRODUCTION I 'VE GOTTEN SOMEWHAT KNOWN FOR SAYING THAT PATIENTS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR DATA AND I ACTUALLY SAID AT ONE CONFERENCE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
DavedeBronkart_2010X@729.07:744.24 WHICH IS STARTING TO BREAK OUT STARTING TO BREAK THROUGH THE WATER SYMBOLIZES OUR DATA AND IN FACT I WANT TO DO A LITTLE SOMETHING IMPROVISATIONAL FOR YOU HERE THERE 'S A GUY ON TWITTER THAT I KNOW A HEALTH IT GUY OUTSIDE BOSTON AND HE WROTE THE E PATIENT RAP
DavedeBronkart_2010X@775.99:778.83 WELL THANK YOU THAT SHOT THE TIMING
DavedeBronkart_2010X@786.05:790.06 THAN THE HEALTH TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU TO HELP TAKE CARE OF YOUR FAMILY
DavedeBronkart_2010X@806.67:809.57 AND THEN I REALIZED IT REMINDED ME OF GOOGLE EARTH
DavedeBronkart_2010X@809.6:812.21 WHERE YOU CAN FLY TO ANY ADDRESS
DavedeBronkart_2010X@812.4:817.4 AND I THOUGHT WHY NOT TAKE THIS AND CONNECT IT TO MY DIGITAL SCAN DATA
DavedeBronkart_2010X@817.73:820.01 AND HAVE GOOGLE EARTH FOR MY BODY
DavedeBronkart_2010X@820.64:825 WHAT DID GOOGLE COME OUT WITH THIS YEAR NOW THERE 'S GOOGLE BODY BROWSER
DavedeBronkart_2010X@825.4:829.17 BUT YOU SEE IT 'S STILL GENERIC IT 'S NOT MY DATA
DavedeBronkart_2010X@829.17:845.88 BUT IF WE CAN GET THAT DATA OUT FROM BEHIND THE DAM SO SOFTWARE INNOVATORS CAN POUNCE ON IT THE WAY SOFTWARE INNOVATORS LIKE TO DO WHO KNOWS WHAT WE 'LL BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH ONE FINAL STORY THIS IS KELLY YOUNG A RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS PATIENT FROM FLORIDA
DavedeBronkart_2010X@846.13:854.92 THIS IS A LIVE STORY UNFOLDING JUST IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS RA PATIENTS AS THEY CALL THEMSELVES HER BLOG IS RA WARRIOR
DavedeBronkart_2010X@854.92:873.83 HAVE A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE FORTY PERCENT OF THEM HAVE NO VISIBLE SYMPTOMS AND THAT MAKES IT JUST REALLY HARD TO TELL HOW THE DISEASE IS GOING AND SOME DOCTORS THINK YEAH RIGHT YOU 'RE REALLY IN PAIN WELL SHE FOUND THROUGH HER ONLINE RESEARCH A NUCLEAR BONE SCAN THAT 'S USUALLY USED FOR CANCER BUT IT CAN ALSO REVEAL
DavedeBronkart_2010X@873.83:884.88 INFLAMMATION AND SHE SAW THAT IF THERE IS NO INFLAMMATION THEN THE SCAN IS A UNIFORM GRAY SO SHE TOOK IT AND THE RADIOLOGIST REPORT
DavedeBronkart_2010X@885.31:893.63 SAID NO CANCER FOUND WELL THAT 'S NOT WHAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO WITH IT SO SHE HAD IT READ AGAIN SHE WANTED TO HAVE IT READ AGAIN AND HER DOCTOR FIRED HER
DavedeBronkart_2010X@893.85:910.62 SHE PULLED UP THE CD HE SAID IF YOU DON 'T WANT TO FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTIONS GO AWAY SO SHE PULLED UP THE CD OF THE SCAN IMAGES AND LOOK AT ALL THOSE HOT SPOTS AND SHE 'S NOW ACTIVELY ENGAGED ON HER BLOG IN LOOKING FOR ASSISTANCE IN GETTING BETTER CARE
DavedeBronkart_2010X@910.83:915.72 SEE THAT IS AN EMPOWERED PATIENT NO MEDICAL TRAINING WE ARE YOU ARE
DavedeBronkart_2010X@915.9:929.32 THE MOST UNDERUSED RESOURCE IN HEALTH CARE WHAT SHE WAS ABLE TO DO WAS BECAUSE SHE HAD ACCESS TO THE RAW DATA HOW BIG A DEAL WAS THIS WELL AT TED TWO THOUSAND AND NINE TIM BERNERS LEE HIMSELF INVENTOR OF THE WEB
DavedeBronkart_2010X@929.37:944.8 GAVE A TALK WHERE HE SAID THE NEXT BIG THING IS NOT TO HAVE YOUR BROWSER GO OUT AND FIND OTHER PEOPLE 'S ARTICLES ABOUT THE DATA BUT THE RAW DATA AND HE GOT THEM CHANTING BY THE END OF THE TALK RAW DATA NOW RAW DATA NOW
DavedeBronkart_2010X@944.84:949.39 AND I ASK YOU THREE WORDS PLEASE TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE
