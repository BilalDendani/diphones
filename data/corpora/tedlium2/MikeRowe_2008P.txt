MikeRowe_2008P@390.54:403.10 IT'S JUST IT'S ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WHERE THE BRAIN GOES OFF ON IT'S OWN AND SUDDENLY I'M STANDING THERE IN THE ROCKIES AND ALL I CAN THINK OF IS THE ARISTOTELIAN DEFINITION OF A TRAGEDY
MikeRowe_2008P@403.43:411.30 YOU KNOW ARISTOTLE SAYS A TRAGEDY IS THAT MOMENT WHEN THE HERO COMES FACE TO FACE WITH HIS OWN IDENTITY
MikeRowe_2008P@412.52:419.91 AND I'M LIKE WHAT IS THIS JACKED UP METAPHOR I DON'T LIKE WHAT I'M THINKING RIGHT NOW AND I CAN'T GET THIS THOUGHT OUT OF MY HEAD AND I CAN'T GET THAT VISION OUT OF MY

MikeRowe_2008P@465.23:473.61 OUR NETWORK DOES IT'S WHAT DIRTY JOBS IS AND I'M UP TO MY NECK IN ANAGNORISES EVERY SINGLE DAY GREAT THE OTHER WORD
MikeRowe_2008P@475.15:485.25 THAT'S THE MOMENT IN THE GREAT TRAGEDIES YOU KNOW EURIPIDES AND SOPHOCLES THE MOMENT WHERE OEDIPUS
MikeRowe_2008P@485.69:493.20 HAS HIS MOMENT WHERE HE SUDDENLY REALIZES THAT HOT CHICK HE 'S BEEN SLEEPING WITH AND HAVING BABIES WITH IS HIS MOTHER OK THAT'S
MikeRowe_2008P@493.76:500.70 OR PERIPETEIA AND THIS METAPHOR IN MY HEAD I GOT ANAGNORISIS AND PERIPETIA ON MY CHIN
MikeRowe_2008P@502.86:513.58 I GOT TO TELL YOU IT'S SUCH A GREAT DEVICE THOUGH WHEN YOU START TO LOOK FOR PERIPETIA YOU FIND IT EVERYWHERE I MEAN BRUCE WILLIS IN THE SIXTH SENSE RIGHT SPENDS THE WHOLE MOVIE
MikeRowe_2008P@525.13:531.77 OH I'M LIVING IN A COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT'S WEIRD THESE DISCOVERIES THAT LEAD TO SUDDEN REALIZATIONS
MikeRowe_2008P@532.27:543.65 AND I'VE BEEN HAVING THEM OVER TWO HUNDRED DIRTY JOBS I HAVE THEM ALL THE TIME BUT THAT ONE THAT ONE DRILLED SOMETHING HOME IN A WAY THAT I JUST WASN'T PREPARED FOR AND AS I STOOD THERE
MikeRowe_2008P@544.24:551.07 LOOKING AT THE HAPPY LAMB THAT I HAD JUST DEFILED BUT IT LOOKED OK
MikeRowe_2008P@551.63:560.02 LOOKING AT THAT POOR OTHER LITTLE THING THAT I'D DONE IT THE RIGHT WAY ON AND I JUST WAS STRUCK BY IF I'M WRONG ABOUT
MikeRowe_2008P@561.91:569.93 I'M WRONG SO OFTEN IN A LITERAL WAY WHAT OTHER PERIPATETIC MISCONCEPTIONS MIGHT I BE ABLE TO COMMENT UPON BECAUSE LOOK
MikeRowe_2008P@570.46:583.30 I'M NOT A SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGIST BUT I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS AND I TALK TO HIM AND HE SAYS HEY MIKE LOOK I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR BRAIN IS INTERESTED IN THIS SORT OF THING OR NOT BUT DO YOU REALIZE YOU'VE SHOT IN
MikeRowe_2008P@584.44:594.44 YOU'VE WORKED IN MINING YOU'VE WORKED IN FISHING YOU'VE WORKED IN STEEL YOU'VE WORKED IN EVERY MAJOR INDUSTRY YOU'VE HAD YOUR BACK SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH THESE GUYS THAT
MikeRowe_2008P@606.72:615.90 AND IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THEIR THOUGHTS COLLECTIVELY IT MIGHT BE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE DUDE YOU KNOW FOUR YEARS
MikeRowe_2008P@617.47:625.83 THAT'S IN MY HEAD TESTICLES ARE ON MY CHIN THOUGHTS ARE BOUNCING AROUND AND AFTER THAT SHOOT DIRTY JOBS
MikeRowe_2008P@626.27:638.14 REALLY DIDN'T CHANGE IN TERMS OF WHAT THE SHOW IS BUT IT CHANGED FOR ME PERSONALLY AND NOW WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE SHOW I NO LONGER JUST TELL THE STORY YOU HEARD AND ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY LIKE IT
MikeRowe_2008P@639.39:645.68 I DO BUT I ALSO START TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS I GOT WRONG SOME OF THE OTHER NOTIONS OF WORK
MikeRowe_2008P@646.15:653.89 THAT I'VE JUST BEEN ASSUMING ARE SACROSANCT AND THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE WITH DIRTY JOBS ARE HAPPIER THAN YOU THINK
MikeRowe_2008P@654.04:668.09 AS A GROUP THEY'RE THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE I KNOW AND I DON'T WANT TO START WHISTLING LOOK FOR THE UNION LABEL AND ALL THAT HAPPY WORKER CRAP I'M JUST TELLING YOU THAT THESE ARE BALANCED PEOPLE WHO DO UNTHINKABLE WORK ROADKILL PICKER UPPERS WHISTLE WHILE THEY WORK I SWEAR TO GOD I DID IT
MikeRowe_2008P@668.89:678.16 THEY'VE GOT THIS AMAZING SORT OF SYMMETRY TO THEIR LIFE AND I SEE IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO I STARTED TO WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
MikeRowe_2008P@678.50:686.34 IF WE CHALLENGED SOME OF THESE SACRED COWS FOLLOW YOUR PASSION WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT HERE FOR THE LAST THIRTY SIX HOURS
MikeRowe_2008P@699.23:714.47 PASSION IT'S GOING TO WORK OUT I CAN GIVE YOU THIRTY EXAMPLES RIGHT NOW BOB COMBS THE PIG FARMER IN LAS VEGAS WHO COLLECTS THE UNEATEN SCRAPS OF FOOD FROM THE CASINOS AND FEEDS THEM THEM TO HIS SWINE WHY BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH PROTEIN IN THE STUFF WE DON'T EAT HIS PIGS GROW AT TWICE THE NORMAL SPEED
MikeRowe_2008P@714.68:729.22 AND HE IS ONE RICH PIG FARMER AND HE IS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND HE SPENDS HIS DAYS DOING THIS INCREDIBLE SERVICE AND HE SMELLS LIKE HELL BUT GOD BLESS HIM HE 'S MAKING A GREAT LIVING YOU ASK HIM DID YOU FOLLOW YOUR PASSION HERE AND HE'D LAUGH AT YOU THE GUY 'S WORTH
MikeRowe_2008P@729.58:737.90 HE JUST GOT OFFERED LIKE SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR HIS FARM AND TURNED IT DOWN OUTSIDE OF VEGAS HE DIDN'T FOLLOW HIS PASSION HE STEPPED BACK AND HE WATCHED WHERE EVERYBODY WAS
MikeRowe_2008P@738.92:751.01 AND HE WENT THE OTHER WAY AND I HEAR THAT STORY OVER AND OVER MATT FROIND A DAIRY FARMER IN NEW CANAAN CONNECTICUT WHO WOKE UP ONE DAY AND REALIZED THE CRAP FROM HIS COWS WAS WORTH MORE THAN THEIR MILK
MikeRowe_2008P@751.26:759.66 IF HE COULD USE IT TO MAKE THESE BIODEGRADABLE FLOWER POTS NOW HE 'S SELLING THEM TO WALMART FOLLOW HIS PASSION THE
MikeRowe_2008P@760.66:770.69 COME ON SO I STARTED TO LOOK AT PASSION I STARTED TO LOOK AT EFFICIENCY VERSUS EFFECTIVENESS AS TIM TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAT'S A HUGE DISTINCTION
MikeRowe_2008P@771.05:785.08 I STARTED TO LOOK AT TEAMWORK AND DETERMINATION AND BASICALLY ALL THOSE PLATITUDES THEY CALL SUCCESSORIES THAT HANG WITH THAT SCHMALTZY ART IN BOARDROOMS AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT NOW THAT STUFF IT'S SUDDENLY ALL BEEN TURNED ON ITS HEAD
MikeRowe_2008P@785.72:792.32 SAFETY SAFETY FIRST IS ME GOING BACK TO YOU KNOW OSHA AND PETA AND THE HUMANE SOCIETY
MikeRowe_2008P@792.96:800.28 WHAT IF OSHA GOT IT WRONG I MEAN THIS IS HERESY WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY BUT WHAT IF IT'S REALLY SAFETY THIRD
MikeRowe_2008P@803.21:817.39 I MEAN REALLY WHAT I MEAN TO SAY IS I VALUE MY SAFETY ON THESE CRAZY JOBS AS MUCH AS THE PEOPLE THAT I'M WORKING WITH BUT THE ONES WHO REALLY GET IT DONE THEY'RE NOT OUT THERE TALKING ABOUT SAFETY FIRST
MikeRowe_2008P@817.93:824.50 THEY KNOW THAT OTHER THINGS COME FIRST THE BUSINESS OF DOING THE WORK COMES FIRST THE BUSINESS OF GETTING IT DONE AND
MikeRowe_2008P@825.21:833.97 NEVER FORGET UP IN THE BERING SEA I WAS ON A CRAB BOAT WITH THE DEADLIEST CATCH GUYS WHICH I ALSO WORK ON IN THE FIRST SEASON WE'RE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES OFF THE COAST OF RUSSIA
MikeRowe_2008P@834.50:843.69 FIFTY FOOT SEAS BIG WAVES GREEN WATER COMING OVER THE WHEELHOUSE RIGHT MOST HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENT I'D EVER SEEN AND I WAS BACK WITH A GUY LASHING THE POTS DOWN
MikeRowe_2008P@843.96:850.03 SO I'M FORTY FEET OFF THE DECK WHICH IS LIKE LOOKING DOWN AT THE TOP OF YOUR SHOE YOU KNOW AND IT'S DOING THIS IN THE OCEAN
MikeRowe_2008P@866.41:876.31 BUT IN THAT MOMENT WHAT HE SAID NEXT CAN'T BE REPEATED IN THE LOWER FORTY EIGHT IT CAN'T BE REPEATED ON ANY FACTORY FLOOR OR ANY CONSTRUCTION SITE BUT HE LOOKED AT ME AND HE SAID SON
MikeRowe_2008P@876.59:887.00 HE 'S MY AGE BY THE WAY HE CALLS ME SON I LOVE THAT HE SAYS SON I'M A CAPTAIN OF A CRAB BOAT MY RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT TO GET YOU HOME ALIVE MY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO GET YOU HOME RICH
MikeRowe_2008P@909.84:923.83 AT LENGTH ABOUT THE MANY LITTLE DISTINCTIONS WE MADE AND THE ENDLESS LIST OF WAYS THAT I GOT IT WRONG BUT WHAT IT ALL COMES DOWN TO IS THIS I FORMED A THEORY AND I'M GOING TO SHARE IT NOW IN MY REMAINING TWO MINUTES AND THIRTY SECONDS IT GOES LIKE THIS
MikeRowe_2008P@924.88:934.31 WE'VE DECLARED WAR ON WORK AS A SOCIETY ALL OF US IT'S A CIVIL WAR IT'S A COLD WAR REALLY WE DIDN'T
MikeRowe_2008P@935.22:942.36 SET OUT TO DO IT AND WE DIDN'T TWIST OUR MUSTACHE IN SOME MACHIAVELLIAN WAY BUT WE'VE DONE IT AND WE'VE WAGED THIS WAR
MikeRowe_2008P@942.98:956.49 ON AT LEAST FOUR FRONTS CERTAINLY IN HOLLYWOOD THE WAY WE PORTRAY WORKING PEOPLE ON TV IT'S LAUGHABLE IF THERE'S A PLUMBER HE 'S THREE HUNDRED POUNDS AND HE 'S GOT A GIANT BUTTCRACK ADMIT IT YOU SEE HIM ALL THE TIME THAT'S WHAT PLUMBERS LOOK LIKE
MikeRowe_2008P@957.65:967.17 WE TURN THEM INTO HEROES OR WE TURN THEM INTO PUNCHLINES THAT'S WHAT TV DOES WE TRY HARD ON DIRTY JOBS NOT TO DO THAT WHICH IS WHY I DO THE WORK AND I DON'T CHEAT BUT
MikeRowe_2008P@968.40:976.88 WE'VE WAGED THIS WAR ON MADISON AVENUE I MEAN SO MANY OF THE COMMERCIALS THAT COME OUT THERE IN THE WAY OF A MESSAGE WHAT'S REALLY BEING SAID
MikeRowe_2008P@977.04:987.38 YOUR LIFE WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU COULD WORK A LITTLE LESS IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK SO HARD IF YOU COULD GET HOME A LITTLE EARLIER IF YOU COULD RETIRE A LITTLE FASTER IF YOU COULD PUNCH OUT A LITTLE SOONER IT'S ALL IN THERE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN
MikeRowe_2008P@988.27:1000.96 WASHINGTON I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT THE DEALS AND POLICIES IN PLACE THAT AFFECT THE BOTTOM LINE REALITY OF THE AVAILABLE JOBS BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY KNOW I JUST KNOW THAT THAT'S A FRONT IN THIS WAR AND RIGHT HERE GUYS SILICON VALLEY
MikeRowe_2008P@1001.50:1015.14 I MEAN HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE AN IPHONE ON THEM RIGHT NOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE THEIR BLACKBERRIES WE'RE PLUGGED IN WE'RE CONNECTED I WOULD NEVER SUGGEST FOR A SECOND THAT SOMETHING BAD HAS COME OUT OF THE TECH REVOLUTION GOOD GRIEF NOT TO THIS CROWD
MikeRowe_2008P@1017.34:1028.13 BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT INNOVATION WITHOUT IMITATION IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND NOBODY CELEBRATES IMITATION THE WAY DIRTY JOBS GUYS
MikeRowe_2008P@1028.89:1041.07 IT HAS TO BE DONE YOUR IPHONE WITHOUT THOSE PEOPLE MAKING THE SAME INTERFACE THE SAME CIRCUITRY THE SAME BOARD OVER AND OVER ALL THAT THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT EQUALLY AS POSSIBLE AS THE GENIUS THAT GOES
MikeRowe_2008P@1041.88:1054.12 INSIDE OF IT SO WE'VE GOT THIS NEW TOOLBOX YOU KNOW OUR TOOLS TODAY DON'T LOOK LIKE SHOVELS AND PICKS THEY LOOK LIKE THE STUFF WE WALK AROUND WITH AND SO THE COLLECTIVE
MikeRowe_2008P@1056.03:1057.59 EFFECT OF ALL OF THAT
MikeRowe_2008P@1057.73:1070.63 HAS BEEN THIS MARGINALIZATION OF LOTS AND LOTS OF JOBS AND I REALIZED PROBABLY TOO LATE IN THIS GAME I HOPE NOT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO TWO HUNDRED MORE OF THESE THINGS BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO AS MANY AS WE CAN
MikeRowe_2008P@1071.06:1080.10 AND TO ME THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW AND TO REALLY COME FACE TO FACE WITH IS THAT FACT THAT I GOT IT WRONG ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS NOT JUST THE TESTICLES ON MY CHIN
MikeRowe_2008P@1080.41:1088.36 I GOT A LOT WRONG SO WE'RE THINKING BY WE I MEAN ME THAT
MikeRowe_2008P@1089.90:1096.88 THE THING TO DO IS TO TALK ABOUT A PR CAMPAIGN FOR WORK MANUAL LABOR SKILLED LABOR
MikeRowe_2008P@1106.14:1111.04 KIND OF YOU KNOW KIND OF LOST A LITTLE
MikeRowe_2008P@1153.22:1153.60 SO
MikeRowe_2008P@1155.06:1165.51 IF I WERE RUNNING FOR ANYTHING AND I'M NOT I WOULD SIMPLY SAY THAT THE JOBS WE HOPE TO MAKE AND THE JOBS WE HOPE TO CREATE AREN'T GOING TO STICK UNLESS THEY'RE JOBS THAT PEOPLE WANT
MikeRowe_2008P@1166.09:1179.89 AND I KNOW THE POINT OF THIS CONFERENCE IS TO CELEBRATE THINGS THAT ARE NEAR AND DEAR TO US BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT CLEAN AND DIRTY AREN'T OPPOSITES THEY'RE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN JUST LIKE INNOVATION AND IMITATION LIKE RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY
MikeRowe_2008P@1180.42:1191.21 LIKE PERIPETIA AND ANAGNORISIS LIKE THAT POOR LITTLE LAMB WHO I HOPE ISN'T QUIVERING ANYMORE AND LIKE MY TIME THAT'S GONE IT'S BEEN GREAT TALKING TO YOU AND GET BACK
