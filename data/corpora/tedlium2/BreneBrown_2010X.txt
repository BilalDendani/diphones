BreneBrown_2010X SO I'LL START WITH THIS A COUPLE YEARS AGO AN EVENT PLANNER CALLED ME BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO DO A SPEAKING EVENT AND SHE CALLED AND SHE SAID
BreneBrown_2010X REALLY STRUGGLING WITH HOW TO WRITE ABOUT YOU ON THE LITTLE FLIER AND I THOUGHT WELL WHAT'S THE STRUGGLE AND SHE SAID
BreneBrown_2010X WELL I SAW YOU SPEAK AND I'M GOING TO CALL YOU A RESEARCHER I THINK BUT I'M AFRAID IF I CALL YOU A RESEARCHER NO ONE WILL COME BECAUSE THEY'LL THINK YOU'RE BORING
BreneBrown_2010X OKAY AND SHE SAID
BreneBrown_2010X THE THING I LIKED ABOUT YOUR TALK IS YOU'RE A STORYTELLER SO I THINK WHAT I'LL DO IS JUST CALL YOU A STORYTELLER AND OF COURSE THE ACADEMIC INSECURE PART OF ME WAS LIKE
BreneBrown_2010X AND SHE SAID I 'M GOING TO CALL YOU A STORYTELLER AND I WAS LIKE
BreneBrown_2010X LET ME THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A SECOND I TRIED TO CALL DEEP ON MY COURAGE
BreneBrown_2010X I THOUGHT I AM A STORYTELLER I'M A QUALITATIVE RESEARCHER I COLLECT STORIES
BreneBrown_2010X I DO AND MAYBE STORIES ARE JUST DATA WITH A SOUL AND MAYBE I'M JUST A STORYTELLER AND SO I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT
BreneBrown_2010X SAY I'M A RESEARCHER STORYTELLER
BreneBrown_2010X I'M A RESEARCHER STORYTELLER AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EXPANDING PERCEPTION AND SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU AND TELL SOME STORIES ABOUT A PIECE OF MY RESEARCH
BreneBrown_2010X I WAS A YOUNG RESEARCHER DOCTORAL STUDENT MY FIRST YEAR I HAD A RESEARCH PROFESSOR WHO SAID TO
BreneBrown_2010X HERE 'S THE THING IF YOU CANNOT MEASURE IT IT DOES NOT EXIST AND
BreneBrown_2010X SO MY ENTIRE ACADEMIC CAREER WAS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO KIND OF BELIEVED THE LIFE 'S MESSY LOVE IT
BreneBrown_2010X AND I'M MORE OF THE LIFE 'S MESSY CLEAN IT UP
BreneBrown_2010X AND SO TO THINK THAT I HAD FOUND MY WAY TO FOUND A CAREER THAT TAKES ME REALLY ONE OF THE BIG SAYINGS IN SOCIAL WORK IS LEAN INTO THE DISCOMFORT OF THE WORK
BreneBrown_2010X AND I'M LIKE KNOCK DISCOMFORT UPSIDE THE HEAD AND MOVE IT OVER AND GET ALL A 'S THAT WAS MY
BreneBrown_2010X SO I WAS VERY EXCITED
BreneBrown_2010X I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT
BreneBrown_2010X THIS IS THE CAREER FOR ME BECAUSE I AM INTERESTED IN SOME MESSY TOPICS BUT I WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THEM
BreneBrown_2010X I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THEM I WANT TO HACK INTO THESE THINGS I KNOW ARE IMPORTANT AND LAY THE CODE OUT FOR EVERYONE TO SEE SO WHERE I STARTED
BreneBrown_2010X WAS WITH CONNECTION BECAUSE BY THE TIME YOU'RE A SOCIAL WORKER FOR TEN YEARS WHAT YOU REALIZE IS THAT CONNECTION IS
BreneBrown_2010X WHY WE'RE HERE IT'S WHAT GIVES PURPOSE AND MEANING TO OUR LIVES THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU TALK TO PEOPLE WHO WORK IN SOCIAL JUSTICE AND MENTAL HEALTH
BreneBrown_2010X KNOW THAT SITUATION WHERE YOU GET AN EVALUATION FROM YOUR BOSS AND SHE TELLS YOU THIRTY SEVEN THINGS YOU DO REALLY AWESOME AND ONE THING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH
BreneBrown_2010X AND ALL YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IS THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH RIGHT
BreneBrown_2010X WELL APPARENTLY THIS IS THE WAY MY WORK WENT AS WELL BECAUSE WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE ABOUT LOVE
BreneBrown_2010X THEY TELL YOU ABOUT HEARTBREAK WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE ABOUT BELONGING THEY'LL TELL YOU THEIR MOST EXCRUCIATING EXPERIENCES OF BEING EXCLUDED AND WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE ABOUT CONNECTION THE STORIES THEY TOLD ME WERE ABOUT DISCONNECTION
BreneBrown_2010X VERY QUICKLY REALLY ABOUT SIX WEEKS INTO THIS RESEARCH I RAN INTO THIS UNNAMED THING THAT ABSOLUTELY UNRAVELED CONNECTION
BreneBrown_2010X IN A WAY THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND OR HAD NEVER SEEN AND SO I PULLED BACK OUT OF THE RESEARCH AND THOUGHT I NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS IS AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE SHAME
BreneBrown_2010X BE WORTHY OF CONNECTION
BreneBrown_2010X THE THINGS I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT IT IT'S UNIVERSAL WE ALL HAVE IT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO DON'T EXPERIENCE SHAME HAVE NO CAPACITY FOR HUMAN EMPATHY OR CONNECTION NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT AND THE LESS YOU TALK ABOUT IT THE MORE YOU HAVE
BreneBrown_2010X WHAT UNDERPINNED THIS SHAME THIS I 'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH
BreneBrown_2010X WHICH WE ALL KNOW THAT FEELING I 'M NOT BLANK ENOUGH I'M NOT THIN ENOUGH RICH ENOUGH BEAUTIFUL ENOUGH SMART ENOUGH PROMOTED ENOUGH THE THING THAT UNDERPINNED THIS WAS
BreneBrown_2010X IDEA
BreneBrown_2010X IN ORDER FOR CONNECTION TO HAPPEN WE HAVE TO ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE SEEN REALLY SEEN AND YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT VULNERABILITY I HATE VULNERABILITY AND SO I THOUGHT THIS IS MY CHANCE
BreneBrown_2010X TO BEAT IT BACK WITH MY MEASURING STICK I'M GOING IN I'M GOING TO FIGURE THIS STUFF OUT I'M GOING TO SPEND A YEAR I'M GOING TO TOTALLY DECONSTRUCT SHAME I'M GOING TO UNDERSTAND HOW VULNERABILITY WORKS AND I'M GOING TO OUTSMART IT
BreneBrown_2010X SO I WAS READY AND I WAS REALLY EXCITED
BreneBrown_2010X AS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO TURN OUT WELL
BreneBrown_2010X SO I COULD TELL YOU A LOT ABOUT SHAME BUT I'D HAVE TO BORROW EVERYONE ELSE'S TIME BUT HERE 'S WHAT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT BOILS DOWN TO
BreneBrown_2010X AND THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT I'VE EVER LEARNED IN THE DECADE OF DOING THIS RESEARCH
BreneBrown_2010X MY ONE YEAR TURNED INTO SIX YEARS THOUSANDS OF STORIES HUNDREDS OF LONG INTERVIEWS FOCUS GROUPS AT ONE POINT PEOPLE WERE SENDING ME JOURNAL PAGES AND SENDING ME THEIR STORIES
BreneBrown_2010X THOUSANDS OF PIECES OF DATA IN SIX YEARS AND I KIND OF GOT A HANDLE ON IT I KIND OF UNDERSTOOD THIS IS WHAT SHAME IS THIS IS HOW IT WORKS
BreneBrown_2010X WHO REALLY HAVE A SENSE OF WORTHINESS THAT'S WHAT THIS COMES DOWN TO A SENSE OF WORTHINESS THEY HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF LOVE AND BELONGING
BreneBrown_2010X AND FOLKS WHO STRUGGLE FOR IT AND FOLKS WHO ARE ALWAYS WONDERING IF THEIR GOOD ENOUGH THERE WAS ONLY ONE VARIABLE THAT SEPARATED THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF LOVE AND BELONGING
BreneBrown_2010X AND THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY STRUGGLE FOR IT AND THAT WAS THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF LOVE AND BELONGING
BreneBrown_2010X AND TO ME THE HARD PART OF THE ONE THING THAT KEEPS US OUT OF CONNECTION IS OUR FEAR THAT WE'RE NOT WORTHY OF CONNECTION WAS SOMETHING THAT PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY I FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND BETTER
BreneBrown_2010X SO WHAT I DID
BreneBrown_2010X IS I TOOK ALL OF THE INTERVIEWS WHERE I SAW WORTHINESS WHERE I SAW PEOPLE LIVING THAT WAY AND JUST LOOKED AT
BreneBrown_2010X WHAT DO THESE PEOPLE HAVE IN COMMON I
BreneBrown_2010X SLIGHT OFFICE SUPPLY ADDICTION BUT THAT'S ANOTHER TALK
BreneBrown_2010X SO I HAD A MANILA FOLDER AND I HAD A SHARPIE AND I WAS LIKE WHAT AM I GOING TO CALL THIS RESEARCH AND THE FIRST WORDS THAT CAME TO MY MIND WERE
BreneBrown_2010X WHOLE HEARTED THESE ARE WHOLE HEARTED PEOPLE LIVING FROM THIS DEEP SENSE OF WORTHINESS SO I WROTE AT THE TOP OF THE MANILA FOLDER AND I STARTED LOOKING AT THE DATA IN FACT I DID IT FIRST IN A FOUR DAY
BreneBrown_2010X MY HUSBAND LEFT TOWN WITH THE KIDS
BreneBrown_2010X MEANING HEART AND THE ORIGINAL DEFINITION WAS TO TELL THE STORY OF WHO YOU ARE WITH YOUR WHOLE HEART AND SO THESE FOLKS HAD VERY SIMPLY THE COURAGE TO BE IMPERFECT
BreneBrown_2010X THEY HAD THE COMPASSION TO BE KIND TO THEMSELVES FIRST AND THEN TO OTHERS BECAUSE AS IT TURNS OUT
BreneBrown_2010X WE CAN'T PRACTICE COMPASSION WITH OTHER PEOPLE IF WE CAN'T TREAT OURSELVES KINDLY AND THE LAST WAS THEY HAD CONNECTION AND THIS WAS THE HARD PART
BreneBrown_2010X AS A RESULT OF AUTHENTICITY
BreneBrown_2010X THEY WERE WILLING TO LET GO OF WHO THEY THOUGHT THEY SHOULD BE
BreneBrown_2010X IN ORDER TO BE WHO THEY WERE
BreneBrown_2010X TO ABSOLUTELY DO THAT FOR CONNECTION
BreneBrown_2010X THE OTHER THING THAT THEY HAD IN COMMON WAS
BreneBrown_2010X FULLY EMBRACED VULNERABILITY
BreneBrown_2010X THEY
BreneBrown_2010X BELIEVED THAT WHAT MADE THEM VULNERABLE MADE THEM BEAUTIFUL
BreneBrown_2010X THEY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT VULNERABILITY BEING COMFORTABLE NOR DID THEY TALK ABOUT IT BEING EXCRUCIATING AS I HAD HEARD IT EARLIER IN THE SHAME INTERVIEWING THEY JUST TALKED ABOUT IT BEING NECESSARY
BreneBrown_2010X THEY TALKED ABOUT THE WILLINGNESS
BreneBrown_2010X TO SAY I LOVE YOU FIRST THE WILLINGNESS TO
BreneBrown_2010X DO SOMETHING WHERE THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THE WILLINGNESS TO BREATHE THROUGH WAITING FOR THE DOCTOR TO CALL AFTER YOUR MAMMOGRAM
BreneBrown_2010X WILLING TO INVEST IN A RELATIONSHIP
BreneBrown_2010X THAT MAY OR MAY NOT WORK OUT
BreneBrown_2010X THEY THOUGHT THIS WAS FUNDAMENTAL
BreneBrown_2010X I PERSONALLY THOUGHT IT WAS BETRAYAL I COULD NOT BELIEVE I HAD PLEDGED ALLEGIANCE TO RESEARCH
BreneBrown_2010X AND NOW MY MISSION TO CONTROL AND PREDICT HAD TURNED UP THE ANSWER THAT THE WAY TO LIVE IS WITH VULNERABILITY
BreneBrown_2010X SOUNDS BETTER THAN BREAKDOWN BUT I ASSURE YOU IT WAS A BREAKDOWN
BreneBrown_2010X AND THEY'RE LIKE I 'M JUST SAYING YOU KNOW
BreneBrown_2010X DON'T BRING YOUR MEASURING STICK
BreneBrown_2010X I BROUGHT IN MY LIST OF THE WAY THE WHOLE HEARTED LIVE AND I SAT DOWN
BreneBrown_2010X AND SHE SAID HOW ARE YOU
BreneBrown_2010X I'M OKAY SHE SAID WHAT 'S GOING ON AND THIS IS A THERAPIST
BreneBrown_2010X BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO TO THOSE BECAUSE THEIR B S METERS ARE
BreneBrown_2010X AND SO I SAID HERE 'S THE THING
BreneBrown_2010X OF SHAME AND FEAR AND OUR STRUGGLE FOR WORTHINESS BUT IT APPEARS THAT IT'S ALSO THE BIRTHPLACE OF JOY
BreneBrown_2010X OF CREATIVITY OF BELONGING OF
BreneBrown_2010X LOVE AND I THINK I HAVE A PROBLEM AND I NEED SOME HELP AND I SAID BUT HERE 'S THE THING NO FAMILY STUFF NO CHILDHOOD SHIT I JUST
BreneBrown_2010X NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD
BreneBrown_2010X AND IT DID AND IT DIDN 'T AND IT TOOK ABOUT A YEAR AND YOU KNOW HOW THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WHEN THEY REALIZE
BreneBrown_2010X THAT'S NOT ME AND B I DON'T EVEN HANG OUT WITH PEOPLE LIKE
BreneBrown_2010X FOR ME
BreneBrown_2010X PUSHED I PUSHED BACK I LOST
BreneBrown_2010X THE FIGHT BUT PROBABLY WON MY LIFE BACK
BreneBrown_2010X AND SO THEN I WENT BACK INTO THE RESEARCH AND SPENT THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY THE WHOLE HEARTED WHAT CHOICES THEY WERE MAKING AND WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH VULNERABILITY
BreneBrown_2010X WHY DO WE STRUGGLE WITH IT SO MUCH AM I ALONE IN STRUGGLING WITH VULNERABILITY
BreneBrown_2010X SO THIS IS WHAT I LEARNED
BreneBrown_2010X WE NUMB VULNERABILITY
BreneBrown_2010X WE'RE WAITING FOR THE CALL IT WAS FUNNY I SENT SOMETHING OUT ON TWITTER AND ON FACEBOOK THAT SAYS HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE VULNERABILITY WHAT MAKES YOU FEEL VULNERABLE AND WITHIN AN HOUR AND A HALF I HAD A ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY RESPONSES BECAUSE I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE
BreneBrown_2010X BEING TURNED DOWN ASKING SOMEONE
BreneBrown_2010X WE LIVE IN A VULNERABLE WORLD AND ONE OF THE WAYS WE DEAL WITH IT IS WE NUMB VULNERABILITY AND I THINK THERE'S EVIDENCE AND IT'S NOT THE ONLY REASON THIS EVIDENCE EXISTS BUT I THINK IT'S A HUGE CAUSE WE ARE
BreneBrown_2010X THE MOST IN DEBT
BreneBrown_2010X ADDICTED AND MEDICATED ADULT COHORT IN U S HISTORY
BreneBrown_2010X THE PROBLEM IS AND I LEARNED THIS FROM THE RESEARCH THAT YOU CANNOT SELECTIVELY NUMB
BreneBrown_2010X YOU CAN'T SAY HERE 'S THE BAD
BreneBrown_2010X HERE 'S VULNERABILITY HERE 'S GRIEF HERE 'S SHAME HERE 'S FEAR HERE 'S DISAPPOINTMENT I DON'T WANT TO FEEL THESE I'M GOING TO HAVE A COUPLE OF BEERS AND A BANANA NUT MUFFIN
BreneBrown_2010X I DON'T WANT TO FEEL THESE
BreneBrown_2010X AND I KNOW THAT'S KNOWING LAUGHTER I HACK INTO YOUR LIVES FOR A LIVING GOD
BreneBrown_2010X YOU CAN'T NUMB THOSE HARD FEELINGS WITHOUT NUMBING THE AFFECTS OUR EMOTIONS YOU CANNOT SELECTIVELY NUMB SO WHEN WE NUMB THOSE
BreneBrown_2010X WE NUMB JOY
BreneBrown_2010X WE NUMB GRATITUDE WE NUMB HAPPINESS AND
BreneBrown_2010X WE ARE MISERABLE AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR PURPOSE AND MEANING AND THEN WE FEEL VULNERABLE SO THEN WE HAVE A COUPLE OF
BreneBrown_2010X AND IT BECOMES THIS DANGEROUS CYCLE
BreneBrown_2010X ONE OF THE THINGS
BreneBrown_2010X I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IS WHY AND HOW WE NUMB AND IT DOESN'T JUST HAVE TO BE ADDICTION
BreneBrown_2010X THE OTHER THING WE DO IS WE MAKE EVERYTHING THAT'S UNCERTAIN
BreneBrown_2010X JUST CERTAIN
BreneBrown_2010X THE MORE AFRAID WE ARE THE MORE VULNERABLE WE ARE THE MORE AFRAID WE ARE THIS IS WHAT POLITICS LOOKS LIKE TODAY THERE'S NO DISCOURSE ANYMORE
BreneBrown_2010X WE
BreneBrown_2010X IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO WANTS THEIR LIFE TO LOOK LIKE THIS IT WOULD BE ME BUT IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE FAT FROM OUR BUTTS AND PUT IT IN OUR CHEEKS
BreneBrown_2010X WHICH JUST I HOPE IN A HUNDRED YEARS PEOPLE WILL LOOK BACK AND
BreneBrown_2010X THEY'RE HARDWIRED FOR STRUGGLE WHEN THEY GET HERE AND WHEN YOU HOLD THOSE PERFECT LITTLE BABIES IN YOUR HAND OUR JOB IS NOT SO SAY LOOK AT HER SHE'S
BreneBrown_2010X MY JOB IS JUST TO KEEP HER PERFECT MAKE SURE SHE MAKES THE TENNIS TEAM BY FIFTH GRADE AND YALE BY SEVENTH GRADE
BreneBrown_2010X JOB OUR JOB IS TO LOOK AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE IMPERFECT AND YOU'RE WIRED FOR STRUGGLE BUT YOU ARE WORTHY OF LOVE AND BELONGING
BreneBrown_2010X THAT'S OUR JOB SHOW ME A GENERATION OF KIDS RAISED LIKE THAT AND WE'LL END THE PROBLEMS I THINK THAT WE SEE TODAY WE PRETEND
BreneBrown_2010X WHETHER IT'S A BAILOUT AN OIL SPILL A RECALL WE PRETEND LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING DOESN'T HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON OTHER PEOPLE I WOULD SAY TO COMPANIES THIS IS NOT OUR FIRST RODEO PEOPLE
BreneBrown_2010X WE JUST NEED YOU TO BE AUTHENTIC AND REAL AND SAY
BreneBrown_2010X TO LET OURSELVES BE SEEN DEEPLY SEEN VULNERABLY SEEN
BreneBrown_2010X TO LOVE WITH OUR WHOLE
BreneBrown_2010X TO PRACTICE GRATITUDE AND JOY IN THOSE MOMENTS OF TERROR WHEN WE'RE WONDERING CAN I LOVE YOU THIS MUCH CAN I BELIEVE IN THIS THIS PASSIONATELY CAN I BE THIS FIERCE ABOUT
BreneBrown_2010X IS TO BELIEVE THAT WE'RE ENOUGH BECAUSE WHEN WE WORK FROM A PLACE I BELIEVE THAT SAYS I 'M ENOUGH
