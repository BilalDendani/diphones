MayaBeiser_2011@448.14:457.78 THANK YOU IMAGINING A SOLO CELLO CONCERT ONE WOULD MOST LIKELY THINK OF JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH UNACCOMPANIED CELLO SUITES
MayaBeiser_2011@458.61:463.05 AS A CHILD STUDYING THESE ETERNAL MASTERPIECES
MayaBeiser_2011@474.3:483.14 LATE AT NIGHT AFTER HOURS OF PRACTICING I WOULD LISTEN TO JANIS JOPLIN AND BILLIE HOLIDAY AS THE SOUNDS OF TANGO MUSIC WOULD BE CREEPING FROM MY PARENTS
MayaBeiser_2011@483.51:485.55 STEREO
MayaBeiser_2011@485.55:489.84 IT ALL BECAME MUSIC TO ME I DIDN 'T HEAR THE BOUNDARIES
MayaBeiser_2011@490.09:498.32 I STILL START EVERY DAY PRACTICING PLAYING BACH HIS MUSIC NEVER CEASES TO SOUND FRESH AND SURPRISING TO ME
MayaBeiser_2011@498.32:513.48 BUT AS I WAS MOVING AWAY FROM THE TRADITIONAL CLASSICAL REPERTOIRE AND TRYING TO FIND NEW WAYS OF MUSICAL EXPRESSION I REALIZED THAT WITH TODAY 'S TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES THERE 'S NO REASON TO LIMIT WHAT CAN BE PRODUCED
MayaBeiser_2011@513.62:522.49 AT ONE TIME FROM A SINGLE STRING INSTRUMENT THE POWER AND COHERENCY THAT COMES FROM ONE PERSON HEARING PERCEIVING AND PLAYING ALL THE VOICES
MayaBeiser_2011@522.49:526.17 MAKES A VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE
MayaBeiser_2011@535.06:542.48 THE EXCITEMENT FROM USING MULTI TRACKING THE WAY I DID IN THE PIECE YOU WILL HEAR NEXT COMES FROM
MayaBeiser_2011@542.74:552.03 THE ATTEMPT TO BUILD AND CREATE A WHOLE UNIVERSE WITH MANY DIVERSE LAYERS ALL GENERATED FROM A SINGLE SOURCE
MayaBeiser_2011@552.22:557.75 MY CELLO AND MY VOICE ARE LAYERED TO CREATE THIS LARGE SONIC CANVAS
MayaBeiser_2011@558.41:567.7 WHEN COMPOSERS WRITE MUSIC FOR ME I ASK THEM TO FORGET WHAT THEY KNOW ABOUT THE CELLO I HOPE TO ARRIVE AT NEW TERRITORIES TO DISCOVER SOUNDS I HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE
MayaBeiser_2011@568.14:577.98 I WANT TO CREATE ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES WITH THIS CELLO I BECOME THE MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH THE MUSIC IS BEING CHANNELED AND IN THE PROCESS WHEN ALL IS RIGHT
MayaBeiser_2011@578.24:583 THE MUSIC IS TRANSFORMED AND SO AM I
