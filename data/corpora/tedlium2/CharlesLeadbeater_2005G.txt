CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@16.29:29.80 IN THE SPIRIT OF COLLABORATIVE CREATIVITY IS SIMPLY REPEAT MANY OF THE POINTS THAT THE THREE PEOPLE BEFORE ME HAVE ALREADY MADE BUT DO THEM THIS IS CALLED CREATIVE COLLABORATION IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED BORROWING
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@31.48:38.78 BUT DO IT THROUGH A PARTICULAR PERSPECTIVE AND THAT IS TO ASK ABOUT THE ROLE OF USERS AND CONSUMERS IN THIS EMERGING WORLD OF
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@72.49:79.44 THE MOUNTAIN BIKE CAME FROM USERS CAME FROM YOUNG USERS PARTICULARLY A GROUP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@79.75:87.27 WHO WERE FRUSTRATED WITH TRADITIONAL RACING BIKES WHICH WERE THOSE SORT OF BIKES THAT EDDY MERCKX RODE OR YOUR BIG BROTHER AND THEY'RE VERY GLAMOROUS
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@87.79:101.82 BUT ALSO FRUSTRATED WITH THE BIKES THAT YOUR DAD RODE WHICH SORT OF HAD BIG HANDLEBARS LIKE THAT AND THEY WERE TOO HEAVY SO THEY GOT THE FRAMES FROM THESE BIG BIKES PUT THEM TOGETHER WITH THE GEARS FROM THE RACING BIKES GOT THE BRAKES FROM MOTORCYCLES
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@102.56:114.19 AND SORT OF MIXED AND MATCHED VARIOUS INGREDIENTS AND FOR THE FIRST I DON'T KNOW THREE TO FIVE YEARS OF THEIR LIFE MOUNTAIN BIKES WERE KNOWN AS CLUNKERS AND THEY WERE JUST MADE IN A COMMUNITY OF BIKERS MAINLY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@114.58:124.70 AND THEN ONE OF THESE COMPANIES THAT WAS IMPORTING PARTS FOR THE CLUNKERS DECIDED TO SET UP IN BUSINESS START SELLING THEM TO OTHER PEOPLE AND GRADUALLY ANOTHER COMPANY EMERGED OUT OF THAT MARIN
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@125.21:134.06 AND IT PROBABLY WAS I DON'T KNOW TEN MAYBE EVEN FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE BIG BIKE COMPANIES REALIZED THERE WAS A MARKET THIRTY YEARS LATER
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@134.74:142.97 MOUNTAIN BIKE SALES AND MOUNTAIN BIKE EQUIPMENT ACCOUNT FOR SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF BIKE SALES IN AMERICA THAT'S FIFTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@143.35:155.65 THIS IS A CATEGORY ENTIRELY CREATED BY CONSUMERS THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CREATED BY THE MAINSTREAM BIKE MARKET BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T SEE THE NEED THE OPPORTUNITY THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE INCENTIVE TO INNOVATE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@156.16:165.60 THE ONE THING I THINK I DISAGREE WITH ABOUT YOCHAI 'S PRESENTATION IS WHEN HE SAID THE INTERNET CAUSES THIS DISTRIBUTIVE CAPACITY FOR INNOVATION TO COME ALIVE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@165.88:179.42 IT'S WHEN THE INTERNET COMBINES WITH THESE KINDS OF PASSIONATE PRO AM CONSUMERS WHO ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE THEY'VE GOT THE INCENTIVE TO INNOVATE THEY'VE GOT THE TOOLS THEY WANT TO THAT YOU GET THIS KIND OF EXPLOSION OF CREATIVE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@180.49:193.63 COLLABORATION AND OUT OF THAT YOU GET THE NEED FOR THE KIND OF THINGS THAT JIMMY WAS TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS OUR NEW KINDS OF ORGANIZATION OR A BETTER WAY TO PUT IT HOW DO WE ORGANIZE OURSELVES WITHOUT ORGANIZATIONS THAT'S NOW POSSIBLE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@193.91:207.32 YOU DON'T NEED AN ORGANIZATION TO BE ORGANIZED TO ACHIEVE LARGE AND COMPLEX TASKS LIKE INNOVATING NEW SOFTWARE PROGRAMS SO THIS IS A HUGE CHALLENGE TO THE WAY WE THINK CREATIVITY COMES ABOUT
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@207.98:218.08 THE TRADITIONAL VIEW STILL ENSHRINED IN MUCH OF THE WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT CREATIVITY IN ORGANIZATIONS IN GOVERNMENT IS THAT CREATIVITY IS ABOUT SPECIAL PEOPLE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@218.51:227.21 WEAR BASEBALL CAPS THE WRONG WAY ROUND COME TO CONFERENCES LIKE THIS IN SPECIAL PLACES ELITE UNIVERSITIES R D LABS IN THE FORESTS WATER
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@228.24:234.66 MAYBE SPECIAL ROOMS IN COMPANIES PAINTED FUNNY COLORS YOU KNOW BEAN BAGS MAYBE THE ODD TABLE FOOTBALL TABLE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@244.37:253.52 THEY CAN SAY YES OR NO TO THE INVENTION THAT'S THE IDEA OF CREATIVITY WHAT'S THE POLICY RECOMMENDATION OUT OF THAT IF YOU'RE IN GOVERNMENT OR YOU'RE RUNNING A LARGE COMPANY
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@254.10:265.26 MORE SPECIAL PEOPLE MORE SPECIAL PLACES BUILD CREATIVE CLUSTERS IN CITIES CREATE MORE R D PARKS SO ON AND SO FORTH EXPAND THE PIPELINE DOWN TO THE CONSUMERS
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@265.92:275.73 WELL THIS VIEW I THINK IS INCREASINGLY WRONG I THINK IT'S ALWAYS BEEN WRONG BECAUSE I THINK ALWAYS CREATIVITY HAS BEEN HIGHLY COLLABORATIVE AND IT'S PROBABLY BEEN LARGELY INTERACTIVE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@285.17:299.39 AND THEY'RE OFTEN AHEAD OF THE PRODUCERS WHY IS THAT WELL ONE ISSUE IS THAT RADICAL INNOVATION WHEN YOU'VE GOT IDEAS THAT AFFECT A LARGE NUMBER OF TECHNOLOGIES OR PEOPLE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@299.98:307.36 HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY ATTACHED TO THEM THE PAYOFFS TO INNOVATION ARE GREATEST WHERE THE UNCERTAINTY IS HIGHEST
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@307.89:317.75 AND WHEN YOU GET A RADICAL INNOVATION IT'S OFTEN VERY UNCERTAIN HOW IT CAN BE APPLIED THE WHOLE HISTORY OF TELEPHONY IS A STORY OF DEALING WITH THAT UNCERTAINTY
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@318.15:328.34 THE VERY FIRST LAND LINE TELEPHONES THE INVENTORS THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD BE USED FOR PEOPLE TO LISTEN IN TO LIVE PERFORMANCES FROM WEST END THEATERS
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@328.73:339.00 WHEN THE MOBILE TELEPHONE COMPANIES INVENTED SMS THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS FOR IT WAS ONLY WHEN THAT TECHNOLOGY GOT INTO THE HANDS OF TEENAGE USERS THAT THEY INVENTED THE USE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@339.45:351.44 SO THE MORE RADICAL THE INNOVATION THE MORE THE UNCERTAINTY THE MORE YOU NEED INNOVATION IN USE TO WORK OUT WHAT A TECHNOLOGY IS FOR ALL OF OUR PATENTS OUR
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@351.85:359.88 ENTIRE APPROACH TO PATENTS AND INVENTION IS BASED ON THE IDEA THAT THE INVENTOR KNOWS WHAT THE INVENTION IS FOR WE CAN SAY WHAT IT'S
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@360.97:368.00 MORE AND MORE THE INVENTORS OF THINGS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SAY THAT IN ADVANCE IT WILL BE WORKED OUT IN USE IN COLLABORATION
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@370.17:377.44 WE LIKE TO THINK THAT INVENTION IS A SORT OF MOMENT OF CREATION THERE IS A MOMENT OF BIRTH WHEN SOMEONE COMES UP WITH AN IDEA
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@377.85:386.69 THE TRUTH IS THAT MOST CREATIVITY IS CUMULATIVE AND COLLABORATIVE LIKE WIKIPEDIA IT DEVELOPS OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@387.27:396.48 THE SECOND REASON WHY USERS ARE MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT IS THAT THEY ARE THE SOURCE OF BIG DISRUPTIVE INNOVATIONS IF YOU WANT TO FIND
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@396.67:407.02 THE BIG NEW IDEAS IT'S OFTEN DIFFICULT TO FIND THEM IN MAINSTREAM MARKETS IN BIG ORGANIZATIONS AND JUST LOOK INSIDE LARGE ORGANIZATIONS AND YOU'LL SEE WHY THAT
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@408.79:418.52 SO YOU'RE IN A BIG CORPORATION YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY KEEN TO GO UP THE CORPORATE LADDER DO YOU GO INTO YOUR BOARD AND SAY LOOK I'VE GOT A FANTASTIC IDEA
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@419.13:428.42 FOR AN EMBRYONIC PRODUCT IN A MARGINAL MARKET WITH CONSUMERS WE'VE NEVER DEALT WITH BEFORE AND I'M NOT SURE IT'S GOING TO HAVE A BIG PAYOFF BUT IT COULD BE REALLY REALLY BIG IN THE FUTURE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@429.23:442.98 WHAT YOU DO IS YOU GO IN AND YOU SAY I'VE GOT A FANTASTIC IDEA FOR AN INCREMENTAL INNOVATION TO AN EXISTING PRODUCT WE SELL THROUGH EXISTING CHANNELS TO EXISTING USERS AND I CAN GUARANTEE YOU GET THIS MUCH RETURN OUT OF IT OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@443.48:451.99 BIG CORPORATIONS HAVE AN IN BUILT TENDENCY TO REINFORCE PAST SUCCESS THEY'VE GOT SO MUCH SUNK IN IT THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO SPOT
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@461.04:469.36 WHO IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY THIRTY YEARS AGO WOULD HAVE SAID YES LET 'S INVENT A MUSICAL FORM WHICH IS ALL ABOUT
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@469.90:480.94 DISPOSSESSED BLACK MEN IN GHETTOS EXPRESSING THEIR FRUSTRATION WITH THE WORLD THROUGH A FORM OF MUSIC THAT MANY PEOPLE FIND INITIALLY QUITE DIFFICULT TO LISTEN TO THAT SOUNDS LIKE A WINNER WE'LL GO WITH IT
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@481.97:494.21 SO WHAT HAPPENS RAP MUSIC IS CREATED BY THE USERS THEY DO IT ON THEIR OWN TAPES WITH THEIR OWN RECORDING EQUIPMENT THEY DISTRIBUTE IT THEMSELVES THIRTY YEARS LATER RAP MUSIC IS THE DOMINANT MUSICAL FORM OF POPULAR CULTURE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@494.45:503.43 WOULD NEVER HAVE COME FROM THE BIG COMPANIES HAD TO START THIS IS THE THIRD POINT WITH THESE PRO AMS THIS IS THE PHRASE THAT I'VE USED
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@504.42:512.91 SOME STUFF WHICH I'VE DONE WITH A THINK TANK IN LONDON CALLED DEMOS WHERE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE AMATEURS I E THEY DO IT FOR THE LOVE OF IT
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@513.29:520.60 BUT THEY WANT TO DO IT TO VERY HIGH STANDARDS AND ACROSS A WHOLE RANGE OF FIELDS FROM SOFTWARE ASTRONOMY
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@522.11:529.29 NATURAL SCIENCES VAST AREAS OF LEISURE AND CULTURE LIKE KITE SURFING SO ON AND SO FORTH YOU FIND PEOPLE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@529.82:539.49 WHO WANT TO DO THINGS BECAUSE THEY LOVE IT BUT THEY WANT TO DO THESE THINGS TO VERY HIGH STANDARDS THEY WORK AT THEIR LEISURE IF YOU LIKE THEY TAKE THEIR LEISURE VERY SERIOUSLY
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@539.76:550.49 THEY ACQUIRE SKILLS THEY INVEST TIME THEY USE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S GETTING CHEAPER IT'S NOT JUST THE INTERNET CAMERAS DESIGN TECHNOLOGY LEISURE TECHNOLOGY SURFBOARDS SO
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@561.28:567.29 MORE ABLE TO DO THINGS TOGETHER CONSUMPTION IN THAT SENSE IS AN EXPRESSION OF THEIR PRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@567.90:577.33 WHY WE FOUND PEOPLE WERE INTERESTED IN THIS IS THAT AT WORK THEY DON'T FEEL VERY EXPRESSED THEY DON'T FEEL AS IF THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT REALLY MATTERS TO THEM
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@578.10:589.35 SO THEY PICK UP THESE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES THIS HAS HUGE ORGANIZATIONAL IMPLICATIONS FOR VERY LARGE AREAS OF LIFE TAKE ASTRONOMY AS AN EXAMPLE WHICH YOCHAI HAS ALREADY MENTIONED
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@590.18:599.09 TWENTY YEARS AGO THIRTY YEARS AGO ONLY BIG PROFESSIONAL ASTRONOMERS WITH VERY BIG TELESCOPES COULD SEE FAR INTO SPACE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@599.29:612.80 AND THERE'S A BIG TELESCOPE IN NORTHERN ENGLAND CALLED JODRELL BANK AND WHEN I WAS A KID IT WAS AMAZING BECAUSE THE MOON SHOTS WOULD TAKE OFF AND THIS THING WOULD MOVE ON RAILS AND IT WAS HUGE IT WAS ABSOLUTELY ENORMOUS NOW SIX
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@614.70:620.63 WORKING WITH THE INTERNET WITH DOBSONIAN DIGITAL TELESCOPES WHICH ARE PRETTY MUCH OPEN SOURCE WITH SOME
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@620.94:628.07 LIGHT SENSORS DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THE INTERNET THEY CAN DO WHAT JODRELL BANK COULD ONLY DO THIRTY YEARS AGO
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@628.56:633.57 SO HERE IN ASTRONOMY YOU HAVE THIS VAST EXPLOSION OF NEW PRODUCTIVE RESOURCES THE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@645.64:655.48 CAMPS OVER HERE YOU'VE GOT THE OLD TRADITIONAL CORPORATE MODEL SPECIAL PEOPLE SPECIAL PLACES PATENT IT PUSH IT DOWN THE PIPELINE TO LARGELY WAITING PASSIVE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@656.02:664.20 CONSUMERS OVER HERE LET 'S IMAGINE WE'VE GOT WIKIPEDIA LINUX AND BEYOND OPEN SOURCE THIS IS OPEN THIS IS CLOSED
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@664.67:675.45 THIS IS NEW THIS IS TRADITIONAL WELL THE FIRST THING YOU CAN SAY I THINK WITH CERTAINTY IS WHAT YOCHAI HAS SAID ALREADY IS THERE IS A GREAT BIG STRUGGLE BETWEEN THOSE TWO ORGANIZATIONAL FORMS
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@675.88:683.42 THESE PEOPLE OVER THERE WILL DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THESE KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS SUCCEEDING BECAUSE THEY'RE THREATENED BY THEM
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@683.95:692.48 AND SO THE DEBATES ABOUT COPYRIGHT DIGITAL RIGHTS SO ON AND SO FORTH THESE ARE ALL ABOUT TRYING TO STIFLE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@692.72:703.18 IN MY VIEW THESE KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A COMPLETE CORRUPTION OF THE IDEA OF PATENTS AND COPYRIGHT MEANT TO BE A WAY TO INCENTIVIZE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@704.32:714.56 MEANT TO BE A WAY TO ORCHESTRATE THE DISSEMINATION OF KNOWLEDGE THEY ARE INCREASINGLY BEING USED BY LARGE COMPANIES TO CREATE THICKETS OF PATENTS TO PREVENT INNOVATION TAKING PLACE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@725.65:734.58 THAT IS MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN MICROSOFT OUTLOOK WHICH VENTURE CAPITALIST IN THEIR RIGHT MIND IS GOING TO GIVE YOU ANY MONEY TO SET UP A VENTURE COMPETING WITH MICROSOFT
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@743.34:755.09 SO THERE IS A HUGE COMPETITIVE ARGUMENT ABOUT SUSTAINING THE CAPACITY FOR OPEN SOURCE AND CONSUMER DRIVEN INNOVATION BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST COMPETITIVE LEVERS AGAINST MONOPOLY
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@755.86:764.01 BE HUGE PROFESSIONAL ARGUMENTS AS WELL BECAUSE THE PROFESSIONALS OVER HERE IN THESE CLOSED ORGANIZATIONS THEY MIGHT BE ACADEMICS THEY MIGHT BE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@764.90:772.17 THEY MIGHT BE DOCTORS THEY MIGHT BE JOURNALISTS MY FORMER PROFESSION SAY NO NO YOU CAN'T TRUST THESE PEOPLE OVER HERE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@773.40:778.76 WHEN I STARTED IN JOURNALISM FINANCIAL TIMES TWENTY YEARS AGO
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@779.64:788.16 IT WAS VERY VERY EXCITING TO SEE SOMEONE READING THE NEWSPAPER AND YOU'D KIND OF LOOK OVER THEIR SHOULDER ON THE TUBE TO SEE IF THEY WERE READING YOUR READING YOUR ARTICLE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@799.66:807.00 AND WE ALLOWED USERS READERS TWO PLACES WHERE THEY COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE PAPER THE LETTERS PAGE WHERE THEY COULD WRITE A LETTER IN
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@807.16:817.93 AND WE WOULD CONDESCEND TO THEM CUT IT IN HALF AND PRINT IT THREE DAYS LATER OR THE OP ED PAGE WHERE IF THEY KNEW THE EDITOR HAD BEEN TO SCHOOL WITH HIM SLEPT WITH HIS WIFE THEY COULD WRITE AN ARTICLE FOR THE OP ED PAGE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@818.86:826.47 THOSE WERE THE TWO PLACES SHOCK HORROR NOW THE READERS WANT TO BE WRITERS AND PUBLISHERS THAT'S NOT THEIR ROLE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO READ WHAT WE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@827.36:837.90 BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO BE JOURNALISTS THE JOURNALISTS THINK THAT THE THE BLOGGERS WANT TO BE JOURNALISTS THEY DON'T WANT TO BE JOURNALISTS THEY JUST WANT TO HAVE A VOICE THEY WANT TO AS JIMMY SAID THEY WANT TO HAVE A DIALOGUE A CONVERSATION THEY WANT TO BE PART
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@838.22:847.32 OF THAT FLOW OF INFORMATION WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE IS THAT THE WHOLE DOMAIN OF CREATIVITY IS EXPANDING SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A TREMENDOUS STRUGGLE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@856.95:865.22 AND THESE I THINK ARE TWO CHALLENGES FOR THE OPEN MOVEMENT THE FIRST IS CAN WE REALLY SURVIVE ON VOLUNTEERS
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@865.65:877.10 IF THIS IS SO CRITICAL DO WE NOT NEED IT FUNDED ORGANIZED SUPPORTED IN MUCH MORE STRUCTURED WAYS I THINK THE IDEA OF CREATING THE RED CROSS FOR INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE IS A FANTASTIC IDEA
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@877.66:884.46 BUT CAN WE REALLY ORGANIZE THAT JUST ON VOLUNTEERS WHAT KIND OF CHANGES DO WE NEED IN PUBLIC POLICY AND FUNDING
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@884.70:894.23 TO MAKE THAT POSSIBLE WHAT'S THE ROLE OF THE BBC FOR INSTANCE IN THAT WORLD WHAT SHOULD BE THE ROLE OF PUBLIC POLICY AND FINALLY WHAT I THINK YOU WILL SEE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@908.63:914.49 NEW ORGANIZATIONAL MODELS COMING ABOUT MIXING CLOSED AND OPEN IN TRICKY WAYS IT
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@935.89:943.58 IN AN OFFICE BLOCK BUILT ON WHAT WAS A RICE PADDY FIVE YEARS AGO ONE OF THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SKYSCRAPERS
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@944.07:951.93 BUILT IN SHANGHAI IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AND I WAS HAVING DINNER WITH THIS GUY CALLED TIMOTHY CHEN TIMOTHY CHEN SET UP AN INTERNET BUSINESS IN
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@952.70:959.97 TWO THOUSAND DIDN'T GO INTO THE INTERNET KEPT HIS MONEY DECIDED TO GO INTO COMPUTER GAMES HE RUNS A COMPANY
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@960.22:967.61 CALLED SHANDA WHICH IS THE LARGEST COMPUTER GAMES COMPANY IN CHINA NINE THOUSAND SERVERS ALL OVER CHINA
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@968.39:981.71 HAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION SUBSCRIBERS AT ANY ONE TIME THERE ARE FOUR MILLION PEOPLE PLAYING ONE OF HIS GAMES HOW MANY PEOPLE DOES HE EMPLOY TO SERVICE THAT POPULATION
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@982.65:991.45 FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE WELL HOW CAN HE SERVICE TWO AND A HALF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE FROM FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES BECAUSE BASICALLY HE DOESN'T SERVICE THEM
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@991.76:1000.93 HE GIVES THEM A PLATFORM HE GIVES THEM SOME RULES HE GIVES THEM THE TOOLS AND THEN HE KIND OF ORCHESTRATES THE CONVERSATION HE ORCHESTRATES THE ACTION
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@1013.84:1027.98 GO INTO ONE OF HIS GAMES YOU CREATE A CHARACTER THAT YOU DEVELOP IN THE COURSE OF THE GAME IF FOR SOME REASON YOUR CREDIT CARD BOUNCES OR THERE'S SOME OTHER PROBLEM YOU LOSE YOUR CHARACTER YOU'VE GOT TWO OPTIONS
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@1028.46:1035.92 ONE OPTION YOU CAN CREATE A NEW CHARACTER RIGHT FROM SCRATCH BUT WITH NONE OF THE HISTORY OF YOUR PLAYER THAT COSTS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@1036.49:1048.89 OR YOU CAN GET ON A PLANE FLY TO SHANGHAI QUEUE UP OUTSIDE SHANDA 'S OFFICES COST PROBABLY SIX HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS AND RECLAIM YOUR CHARACTER GET YOUR HISTORY BACK
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@1049.69:1063.57 EVERY MORNING THERE ARE SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE QUEUING OUTSIDE THEIR OFFICES TO RECLAIM THESE CHARACTERS SO THIS IS ABOUT COMPANIES BUILT ON COMMUNITIES THAT PROVIDE COMMUNITIES WITH TOOLS RESOURCES PLATFORMS IN WHICH THEY CAN SHARE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@1064.03:1071.77 HE 'S NOT OPEN SOURCE BUT IT'S VERY VERY POWERFUL SO HERE IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I THINK FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@1073.04:1081.27 DO A LOT OF WORK WITH GOVERNMENT IF YOU'RE A GAMES COMPANY AND YOU'VE GOT A MILLION PLAYERS IN YOUR GAME
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@1081.68:1090.58 YOU ONLY NEED ONE PERCENT OF THEM TO BE CO DEVELOPERS CONTRIBUTING IDEAS AND YOU'VE GOT A DEVELOPMENT WORKFORCE OF TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@1100.66:1108.18 TO THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THE EDUCATION SYSTEM OR IF YOU GOT ONE PERCENT OF THE PATIENTS IN THE NHS TO IN SOME SENSE BE CO
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@1108.79:1120.81 OF HEALTH THE THE REASON WHY DESPITE ALL THE EFFORTS TO CUT IT DOWN TO CONSTRAIN IT TO HOLD IT BACK WHY THESE OPEN MODELS WILL STILL START EMERGING WITH TREMENDOUS FORCE
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G@1121.15:1130.62 IS THAT THEY MULTIPLY OUR PRODUCTIVE RESOURCES AND ONE OF THE REASONS THEY DO THAT IS THAT THEY TURN USERS INTO PRODUCERS CONSUMERS INTO DESIGNERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
