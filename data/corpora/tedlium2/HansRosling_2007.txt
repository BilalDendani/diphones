HansRosling_2007 IF I COULD SHARE THE IMAGE WITH YOU
HansRosling_2007 ON THE SCREEN SO THREE THINGS HAD HAPPENED U N OPENED THEIR STATISTIC DATABASES AND WE HAVE A NEW VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE UP WORKING AS A BETA ON THE NET
HansRosling_2007 SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DOWNLOAD IT ANY LONGER AND LET ME REPEAT WHAT YOU SAW LAST YEAR THE BUBBLES ARE THE COUNTRIES HERE YOU HAVE THE FERTILITY RATE
HansRosling_2007 THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN PER WOMAN AND THERE YOU HAVE THE LENGTH OF LIFE IN YEARS
HansRosling_2007 HOW THINGS REALLY CHANGED AND IT'S AFRICA WHICH STANDS OUT AS THE PROBLEM DOWN HERE DOESN'T IT LARGE FAMILIES
HansRosling_2007 AND THE HIV EPIDEMIC BROUGHT DOWN THE COUNTRIES LIKE THIS THIS IS MORE OR LESS WHAT WE SAW LAST YEAR AND THIS IS HOW IT WILL GO ON INTO THE FUTURE
HansRosling_2007 AND I WILL TALK ON IS THIS POSSIBLE BECAUSE YOU SEE NOW I PRESENTED STATISTICS THAT DON'T EXIST
HansRosling_2007 BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE WE ARE
HansRosling_2007 WILL IT BE POSSIBLE THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN
HansRosling_2007 I COVER MY LIFETIME HERE YOU KNOW I EXPECT TO LIVE ONE HUNDRED YEARS AND THIS IS WHERE WE ARE TODAY NOW COULD WE
HansRosling_2007 LOOK HERE AT INSTEAD
HansRosling_2007 THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN THE WORLD
HansRosling_2007 AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW THAT AGAINST CHILD SURVIVAL WE'LL SWAP THE AXIS HERE YOU HAVE CHILD MORTALITY
HansRosling_2007 THAT IS SURVIVAL FOUR KIDS DYING THERE TWO HUNDRED DYING THERE AND THIS IS GDP PER CAPITA ON THIS AXIS AND THIS WAS TWO THOUSAND
HansRosling_2007 AND SEVEN AND IF I GO BACK IN TIME I'VE ADDED SOME HISTORICAL STATISTICS HERE WE GO
HansRosling_2007 HERE WE GO HERE WE GO NOT SO MUCH STATISTICS ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO SOME COUNTRIES STILL HAD STATISTICS WE ARE LOOKING DOWN IN THE ARCHIVE
HansRosling_2007 AND WHERE WE ARE DOWN INTO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY THERE IS ONLY AUSTRIA AND SWEDEN THAT CAN PRODUCE NUMBERS
HansRosling_2007 HAD ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON PER YEAR AND THEY LOST ONE FIFTH OF THEIR KIDS BEFORE THEIR FIRST BIRTHDAY SO THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WORLD IF WE PLAY THE ENTIRE WORLD
HansRosling_2007 SLOWLY RICHER AND RICHER AND THEY ADD STATISTICS ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL WHEN THEY GET STATISTICS YOU SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT AND HERE CHILDREN DON'T LIVE LONGER
HansRosling_2007 THAT MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF THE CHILDREN SURVIVED THEIR FIRST YEAR THIS IS INDIA COMING UP WITH THE FIRST DATA FROM INDIA AND THIS IS THE UNITED STATES MOVING AWAY HERE EARNING MORE MONEY
HansRosling_2007 AND WE WILL SOON SEE CHINA COMING UP IN THE VERY FAR END CORNER HERE AND IT MOVES UP WITH MAO TSE TUNG GETTING HEALTH NOT GETTING SO RICH THERE HE DIED THEN DENG XIAOPING BRINGS MONEY
HansRosling_2007 THIS WAY OVER HERE AND THE BUBBLES KEEP MOVING UP THERE AND THIS IS WHAT THE WORLD LOOKS LIKE TODAY
HansRosling_2007 THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE A FUNCTION HERE I CAN TELL THE WORLD STAY WHERE YOU ARE AND I TAKE THE UNITED STATES WE STILL WANT TO SEE THE BACKGROUND I PUT THEM UP LIKE THIS AND NOW WE GO BACKWARDS AND WE CAN SEE
HansRosling_2007 AND LOOK HERE COMPARE TO THE PHILIPPINES OF TODAY THE PHILIPPINES OF TODAY HAS ALMOST THE SAME ECONOMY AS THE UNITED STATES DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR BUT WE HAVE TO BRING UNITED STATES FORWARD QUITE A
HansRosling_2007 THIS WORLD WHICH MANY CALL GLOBALIZED IS THAT ASIA ARABIC COUNTRIES LATIN AMERICA ARE MUCH MORE AHEAD IN BEING HEALTHY EDUCATED HAVING HUMAN RESOURCES THAN THEY ARE
HansRosling_2007 A DISCREPANCY IN WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY IN THE EMERGING ECONOMIES THERE NOW SOCIAL BENEFITS SOCIAL PROGRESS ARE GOING AHEAD OF ECONOMICAL PROGRESS
HansRosling_2007 AND HOW LONG DO WE HAVE TO BRING UNITED STATES TO GET THE SAME HEALTH AS CHILE HAS
HansRosling_2007 I THINK WE HAVE TO GO THERE WE HAVE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE OR TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THE UNITED STATES HAS THE SAME
HansRosling_2007 MORE OR LESS THIRTY FORTY YEARS DIFFERENCE ON THE HEALTH AND BEHIND THE HEALTH IS THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL AND THERE'S A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THINGS AND GENERAL HUMAN RESOURCES ARE THERE NOW
HansRosling_2007 WE CAN TAKE AWAY THIS AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU THE RATE OF SPEED THE RATE OF CHANGE
HansRosling_2007 AND I WANT TO LOOK AT JAPAN
HansRosling_2007 AND I WANT TO LOOK AT SWEDEN AND THE UNITED STATES AND I'M GOING TO STAGE A RACE HERE BETWEEN THIS SORT OF YELLOWISH FORD HERE AND THE RED TOYOTA DOWN THERE AND THE BROWNISH VOLVO
HansRosling_2007 AND HERE WE GO HERE WE GO THE TOYOTA HAS A VERY BAD START DOWN HERE YOU CAN SEE AND THE UNITED STATES FORD IS GOING OFF ROAD THERE AND THE VOLVO IS DOING QUITE FINE THIS IS THE WAR THE
HansRosling_2007 AND NOW WE CAN SEE THAT
HansRosling_2007 THE RATE OF CHANGE WAS ENORMOUS IN JAPAN THEY REALLY CAUGHT UP AND THIS CHANGES GRADUALLY WE HAVE TO LOOK OVER GENERATIONS TO UNDERSTAND IT AND
HansRosling_2007 LET ME SHOW YOU MY OWN SORT OF FAMILY HISTORY WE MADE THESE GRAPHS HERE AND THIS IS THE SAME THING MONEY DOWN THERE AND HEALTH YOU KNOW AND THIS IS MY FAMILY
HansRosling_2007 THAT'S WHEN I BELIEVE STATISTICS WHEN IT'S GRANDMA VERIFIED STATISTICS
HansRosling_2007 I THINK IT'S THE BEST WAY OF
HansRosling_2007 WAS BORN IN SINGAPORE NOW THE HEALTHIEST COUNTRY ON THIS EARTH IT BYPASSED SWEDEN ABOUT TWO TO THREE YEARS AGO WITH
HansRosling_2007 BUT THEY'RE VERY SMALL YOU KNOW THEY'RE SO CLOSE TO THE HOSPITAL WE CAN NEVER BEAT THEM OUT
HansRosling_2007 TO
HansRosling_2007 THIS LOOKS ALSO LIKE A VERY GOOD STORY BUT IT'S NOT REALLY THAT EASY THAT IT'S ALL A GOOD STORY BECAUSE I HAVE TO SHOW YOU ONE OF THE OTHER FACILITY WE CAN ALSO
HansRosling_2007 MAKE THE COLOR HERE REPRESENT THE VARIABLE AND WHAT AM I CHOOSING HERE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSION METRIC
HansRosling_2007 THE COST OF EMISSION OF CARBON DIOXIDE
HansRosling_2007 THERE IS NO ONE WHO HAS DONE IT SO FAR AND WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE UPDATED DATA ANY LONGER BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY HOT DATA TODAY AND THERE WE ARE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE
HansRosling_2007 AND IN THE DISCUSSION I ATTENDED WITH GLOBAL LEADERS YOU KNOW MANY SAY NOW THE PROBLEM IS
HansRosling_2007 THE EMERGING ECONOMIES THEY ARE GETTING OUT TOO MUCH CARBON DIOXIDE THE MINISTER OF THE ENVIRONMENT OF INDIA SAID WELL YOU WERE THE ONE WHO CAUSED THE PROBLEM
HansRosling_2007 YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT BUT FROM NOW ON WE COUNT PER
HansRosling_2007 AND EVERYONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PER CAPITA EMISSION THIS REALLY SHOWS YOU WE HAVE NOT SEEN GOOD ECONOMIC AND HEALTH PROGRESS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
HansRosling_2007 DESTROYING THE CLIMATE AND THIS IS REALLY WHAT HAS TO BE CHANGED I'VE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR SHOWING YOU A TOO POSITIVE IMAGE OF THE WORLD
HansRosling_2007 I DON'T THINK IT'S LIKE THIS THE WORLD IS QUITE A MESSY PLACE THIS WE CAN CALL DOLLAR STREET EVERYONE LIVES ON THIS STREET HERE
HansRosling_2007 HERE WHAT NUMBER THEY LIVE ON IS HOW MUCH THEY EARN PER DAY THIS FAMILY EARNS ABOUT ONE DOLLAR PER DAY WE DRIVE UP THE STREET HERE WE FIND A FAMILY HERE
HansRosling_2007 WHICH EARNS ABOUT TWO TO THREE DOLLARS A DAY AND WE DRIVE AWAY HERE WE FIND THE FIRST GARDEN IN THE STREET AND THEY EARN TEN TO FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY
HansRosling_2007 AND HOW DO THEY LIVE IF WE LOOK AT THE BED HERE WE CAN SEE THAT THEY SLEEP ON A RUG ON THE FLOOR THIS IS WHAT POVERTY LINE IS
HansRosling_2007 EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE FAMILY INCOME IS JUST TO COVER THE ENERGY NEEDS THE FOOD FOR THE DAY THIS IS
HansRosling_2007 TWO TO FIVE DOLLARS YOU HAVE A BED AND HERE IT'S A MUCH NICER BEDROOM YOU CAN SEE I LECTURED ON THIS FOR IKEA AND THEY WANTED TO SEE THE SOFA IMMEDIATELY HERE
HansRosling_2007 AND THIS IS THE SOFA HOW IT WILL EMERGE FROM THERE AND THE INTERESTING THING WHEN YOU GO AROUND HERE IN THE PHOTO PANORAMA YOU SEE THE FAMILY STILL SITTING ON THE FLOOR
HansRosling_2007 IS A SOFA IF YOU WATCH IN THE KITCHEN
HansRosling_2007 YOU CAN SEE THAT THE GREAT DIFFERENCE FOR WOMEN DOES NOT COME BETWEEN ONE TO TEN DOLLAR IT COMES BEYOND HERE WHEN YOU REALLY CAN GET GOOD WORKING CONDITIONS IN THE FAMILY AND IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE YOU LOOK AT THE TOILET OVER HERE
HansRosling_2007 THIS CAN CHANGE THIS CAN CHANGE THESE ARE ALL PICTURES AND IMAGES FROM AFRICA AND IT CAN BECOME MUCH BETTER
HansRosling_2007 WE CAN GET OUT OF POVERTY MY OWN RESEARCH HAS NOT BEEN IN IT OR ANYTHING LIKE THIS I SPENT TWENTY YEARS IN INTERVIEWS WITH AFRICAN FARMERS WHO WERE ON THE VERGE OF
HansRosling_2007 AND THIS IS THE RESULT OF THE FARMERS NEEDS RESEARCH THE NICE THING HERE IS THAT YOU CAN'T SEE WHO ARE THE RESEARCHERS IN THIS PICTURE THAT'S WHEN RESEARCH
HansRosling_2007 MUST REALLY LIVE WITH THE PEOPLE
HansRosling_2007 WHEN YOU'RE IN POVERTY
HansRosling_2007 EVERYTHING IS ABOUT SURVIVAL IT'S ABOUT HAVING FOOD
HansRosling_2007 AND THESE TWO YOUNG FARMERS THEY ARE GIRLS NOW BECAUSE THE PARENTS ARE DEAD FROM HIV AND AIDS THEY DISCUSS WITH A TRAINED AGRONOMIST THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST AGRONOMISTS IN MALAWI JUNATAMBE
HansRosling_2007 AND HE 'S DISCUSSING WHAT SORT OF CASSAVA THEY WILL PLANT THE BEST CONVERTER OF SUNSHINE TO FOOD THAT MAN HAS FOUND AND THEY ARE VERY VERY EAGERLY INTERESTED TO GET ADVICE
HansRosling_2007 THAT'S TO SURVIVE IN POVERTY THAT'S
HansRosling_2007 GETTING OUT OF POVERTY THE WOMEN TOLD US ONE THING GET US TECHNOLOGY WE HATE THIS MORTAR TO STAND HOURS AND HOURS GET US A MILL SO THAT WE CAN MILL OUR FLOUR THEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THE REST
HansRosling_2007 TECHNOLOGY WILL BRING YOU OUT OF POVERTY BUT THERE'S A NEED FOR A MARKET TO GET AWAY FROM
HansRosling_2007 SHE WANTS HER KID TO BE HEALTHY SO SHE CAN GO TO THE MARKET AND DOESN'T HAVE TO STAY HOME AND SHE WANTS THE INFRASTRUCTURE IT IS NICE WITH
HansRosling_2007 GOOD WITH CREDIT MICRO CREDITS GAVE HER THE BICYCLE YOU KNOW AND INFORMATION WILL TELL HER WHEN TO GO TO MARKET WITH WHICH
HansRosling_2007 WE HAVE TO KNOW A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE WORLD I HAVE A NEIGHBOR WHO KNOWS TWO HUNDRED TYPES OF WINE HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE KNOWS THE NAME OF THE GRAPE THE TEMPERATURE
HansRosling_2007 I
HansRosling_2007 BUT MY NEIGHBOR ONLY KNOWS TWO TYPES OF COUNTRIES INDUSTRIALIZED AND DEVELOPING AND I KNOW TWO HUNDRED I KNOW ABOUT THE SMALL DATA
HansRosling_2007 GET SERIOUS AND HOW DO YOU GET
HansRosling_2007 HOMAGE TO THE OFFICE PACKAGE
HansRosling_2007 WHAT IS THIS WHAT IS THIS WHAT
HansRosling_2007 I'M TELLING YOU THAT THERE ARE MANY DIMENSIONS OF DEVELOPMENT EVERYONE WANTS YOUR PET THING IF YOU ARE IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR
HansRosling_2007 ALL THESE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPMENT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU JUST GET OUT OF POVERTY AND YOU SHOULD GO TOWARDS WELFARE NOW WHAT
HansRosling_2007 WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IS WHAT IS A GOAL FOR DEVELOPMENT AND WHAT ARE THE MEANS FOR DEVELOPMENT LET ME FIRST GRADE WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT MEANS ECONOMIC GROWTH TO ME
HansRosling_2007 AS A PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSOR IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS EIGHTY PERCENT OF SURVIVAL GOVERNANCE
HansRosling_2007 EDUCATION HUMAN RESOURCES ARE IMPORTANT HEALTH IS ALSO IMPORTANT BUT NOT THAT MUCH AS A MEAN ENVIRONMENT IS IMPORTANT HUMAN RIGHTS IS ALSO IMPORTANT BUT IT JUST GETS ONE CROSS NOW WHAT ABOUT GOALS
HansRosling_2007 ARE WE GOING TOWARD WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN MONEY MONEY IS NOT A GOAL IT'S THE BEST MEAN BUT I GIVE IT ZERO AS A GOAL
HansRosling_2007 IT'S NICE TO BE HEALTHY AT MY AGE ESPECIALLY YOU CAN STAND HERE YOU'RE HEALTHY AND THAT'S GOOD IT GETS TWO PLUSSES ENVIRONMENT IS VERY VERY CRUCIAL THERE'S NOTHING FOR THE GRANDKID IF YOU DON'T SAVE UP BUT WHERE ARE THE IMPORTANT GOALS OF COURSE IT'S HUMAN RIGHTS
HansRosling_2007 HUMAN RIGHTS IS THE GOAL BUT IT'S NOT THAT STRONG OF A MEAN FOR ACHIEVING DEVELOPMENT AND
HansRosling_2007 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I WOULD SAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT BRINGS JOY TO LIFE THAT'S THE VALUE OF
HansRosling_2007 SO THE SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE IS POSSIBLE EVEN AFRICAN COUNTRIES CAN ACHIEVE THIS AND
HansRosling_2007 THE SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE IS POSSIBLE AND REMEMBER PLEASE REMEMBER MY MAIN MESSAGE
HansRosling_2007 IS THIS THE SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE IS POSSIBLE WE CAN HAVE A GOOD
HansRosling_2007 I SHOWED YOU THE SHOTS I PROVED IT IN THE POWERPOINT AND I THINK I WILL CONVINCE YOU
HansRosling_2007 BY
HansRosling_2007 INDIA
HansRosling_2007 YOU CAN HEAR
HansRosling_2007 AND I'M GOING TO
HansRosling_2007 TAKE THIS BLADE OF STEEL AND PUSH IT DOWN THROUGH MY BODY OF BLOOD AND FLESH AND PROVE TO YOU
HansRosling_2007 THAT THE SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE IS POSSIBLE CAN I REQUEST A MOMENT OF ABSOLUTE
