AlaindeBotton_2011G THE
AlaindeBotton_2011G COMMON WAYS OF DIVIDING THE WORLD IS INTO THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND THOSE WHO DON 'T INTO THE RELIGIOUS
AlaindeBotton_2011G AND THE ATHEISTS AND FOR THE LAST DECADE OR SO IT 'S BEEN QUITE CLEAR WHAT BEING AN ATHEIST MEANS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME VERY VOCAL ATHEISTS WHO 'VE POINTED OUT NOT JUST THAT RELIGION IS WRONG BUT THAT IT 'S RIDICULOUS THESE PEOPLE MANY OF WHOM HAVE LIVED IN NORTH OXFORD
AlaindeBotton_2011G DOCTRINES I DON 'T THINK THESE DOCTRINES ARE RIGHT BUT A VERY IMPORTANT BUT I LOVE CHRISTMAS CAROLS
AlaindeBotton_2011G I REALLY LIKE
AlaindeBotton_2011G THE ART OF MANTEGNA I REALLY LIKE LOOKING AT OLD CHURCHES I REALLY LIKE TURNING THE PAGES OF THE OLD TESTAMENT WHATEVER IT MAY BE YOU KNOW THE KIND OF THING I 'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE ATTRACTED TO THE RITUALISTIC SIDE THE MORALISTIC COMMUNAL SIDE OF RELIGION BUT CAN 'T BEAR THE DOCTRINE UNTIL NOW
AlaindeBotton_2011G THESE PEOPLE HAVE FACED A RATHER UNPLEASANT CHOICE IT 'S ALMOST AS THOUGH EITHER YOU ACCEPT THE DOCTRINE AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE NICE STUFF OR YOU REJECT THE DOCTRINE AND YOU 'RE LIVING IN SOME KIND OF SPIRITUAL WASTELAND UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF CNN AND WALMART
AlaindeBotton_2011G SO THAT 'S A SORT OF TOUGH CHOICE I DON 'T THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE I THINK THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE I THINK THERE ARE WAYS AND I 'M BEING BOTH VERY RESPECTFUL AND COMPLETELY IMPIOUS OF STEALING FROM RELIGIONS
AlaindeBotton_2011G IF YOU DON 'T BELIEVE IN A RELIGION THERE 'S NOTHING WRONG WITH PICKING AND MIXING WITH TAKING OUT THE BEST SIDES OF RELIGION
AlaindeBotton_2011G AND FOR ME ATHEISM TWO POINT ZERO IS ABOUT BOTH AS I SAY A RESPECTFUL AND AN IMPIOUS WAY OF GOING THROUGH RELIGIONS AND SAYING WHAT HERE COULD WE USE THE SECULAR WORLD IS FULL OF HOLES WE HAVE SECULARIZED BADLY I WOULD ARGUE
AlaindeBotton_2011G AND A THOROUGH STUDY OF RELIGION COULD GIVE US ALL SORTS OF INSIGHTS INTO AREAS OF LIFE THAT ARE NOT GOING TOO WELL AND I 'D LIKE TO RUN THROUGH A FEW OF THESE TODAY
AlaindeBotton_2011G I 'D LIKE TO KICK OFF BY LOOKING AT EDUCATION NOW EDUCATION IS A FIELD THE SECULAR WORLD REALLY BELIEVES IN WHEN WE THINK ABOUT
AlaindeBotton_2011G HOW WE 'RE GOING TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE WE THINK EDUCATION THAT 'S WHERE WE PUT A LOT OF MONEY EDUCATION IS GOING TO GIVE US NOT ONLY COMMERCIAL SKILLS INDUSTRIAL SKILLS IT 'S ALSO GOING TO MAKE US BETTER PEOPLE YOU KNOW THE KIND OF THING A COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS IS AND GRADUATION CEREMONIES THOSE LYRICAL CLAIMS
AlaindeBotton_2011G THAT EDUCATION THE PROCESS OF EDUCATION PARTICULARLY HIGHER EDUCATION WILL MAKE US INTO NOBLER AND BETTER HUMAN BEINGS THAT 'S A LOVELY IDEA
AlaindeBotton_2011G INTERESTING WHERE IT CAME FROM IN THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY CHURCH ATTENDANCE IN WESTERN EUROPE STARTED SLIDING DOWN VERY VERY SHARPLY AND PEOPLE PANICKED THEY ASKED THEMSELVES THE FOLLOWING QUESTION THEY SAID WHERE ARE PEOPLE GOING TO FIND THE MORALITY WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO FIND GUIDANCE AND WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO FIND SOURCES OF CONSOLATION
AlaindeBotton_2011G AND INFLUENTIAL VOICES CAME UP WITH ONE ANSWER THEY SAID CULTURE IT 'S TO CULTURE THAT WE SHOULD LOOK FOR GUIDANCE FOR CONSOLATION FOR MORALITY LET 'S LOOK TO THE PLAYS OF SHAKESPEARE THE DIALOGUES OF PLATO THE NOVELS OF JANE AUSTEN
AlaindeBotton_2011G IN THERE WE 'LL FIND A LOT OF THE TRUTHS THAT WE MIGHT PREVIOUSLY HAVE FOUND IN THE GOSPEL OF SAINT JOHN
AlaindeBotton_2011G NOW I THINK THAT 'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL IDEA AND A VERY TRUE IDEA THEY WANTED TO REPLACE SCRIPTURE WITH CULTURE AND THAT 'S A VERY PLAUSIBLE IDEA IT 'S ALSO AN IDEA THAT WE HAVE FORGOTTEN
AlaindeBotton_2011G IF YOU WENT TO A TOP UNIVERSITY LET 'S SAY YOU WENT TO HARVARD OR OXFORD OR CAMBRIDGE AND YOU SAID I 'VE COME HERE BECAUSE I 'M IN SEARCH OF MORALITY GUIDANCE AND CONSOLATION I WANT TO KNOW HOW TO LIVE
AlaindeBotton_2011G THEY WOULD SHOW YOU THE WAY TO THE INSANE ASYLUM THIS IS SIMPLY NOT WHAT OUR GRANDEST AND BEST INSTITUTES OF HIGHER LEARNING ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF WHY THEY DON 'T THINK WE NEED IT THEY DON 'T THINK WE ARE IN AN URGENT NEED OF ASSISTANCE THEY SEE US AS ADULTS RATIONAL ADULTS WHAT WE NEED IS INFORMATION WE NEED DATA WE DON 'T NEED HELP NOW
AlaindeBotton_2011G RELIGIONS START FROM A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE INDEED ALL RELIGIONS ALL MAJOR RELIGIONS AT VARIOUS POINTS CALL US CHILDREN
AlaindeBotton_2011G AND LIKE CHILDREN THEY BELIEVE THAT WE ARE IN SEVERE NEED OF ASSISTANCE WE 'RE ONLY JUST HOLDING IT TOGETHER
AlaindeBotton_2011G AND SO WE NEED GUIDANCE AND WE NEED DIDACTIC LEARNING
AlaindeBotton_2011G YOU KNOW IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IN THE U K THE GREATEST PREACHER GREATEST RELIGIOUS PREACHER WAS A MAN CALLED JOHN WESLEY WHO WENT UP AND DOWN THIS COUNTRY DELIVERING SERMONS
AlaindeBotton_2011G HEY HOW ABOUT A SERMON THEY 'D GO NO NO I DON 'T NEED ONE OF THOSE
AlaindeBotton_2011G I 'M AN INDEPENDENT INDIVIDUAL PERSON
AlaindeBotton_2011G WHAT 'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SERMON AND OUR MODERN SECULAR MODE OF DELIVERY THE LECTURE
AlaindeBotton_2011G WELL A SERMON WANTS TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE
AlaindeBotton_2011G AND A LECTURE WANTS TO GIVE YOU A BIT OF INFORMATION AND I THINK WE NEED TO GET BACK TO THAT SERMON TRADITION THE TRADITION OF SERMONIZING IS HUGELY VALUABLE BECAUSE WE ARE IN NEED OF GUIDANCE MORALITY AND CONSOLATION AND RELIGIONS KNOW THAT ANOTHER POINT ABOUT EDUCATION
AlaindeBotton_2011G WE TEND TO BELIEVE IN THE MODERN SECULAR WORLD THAT IF YOU TELL SOMEONE SOMETHING ONCE THEY 'LL REMEMBER IT SIT THEM IN A CLASSROOM TELL THEM ABOUT PLATO AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SEND THEM OUT FOR A CAREER IN MANAGEMENT CONSULTANCY FOR FORTY YEARS AND THAT LESSON WILL STICK WITH THEM RELIGIONS GO NONSENSE
AlaindeBotton_2011G YOU NEED TO KEEP REPEATING THE LESSON TEN TIMES A DAY SO GET ON YOUR KNEES AND REPEAT IT THAT 'S WHAT ALL RELIGIONS TELL US GET ON YOU KNEES AND REPEAT IT TEN OR TWENTY OR FIFTEEN TIMES A DAY OTHERWISE OUR MINDS ARE LIKE SIEVES
AlaindeBotton_2011G SO RELIGIONS ARE CULTURES OF REPETITION THEY CIRCLE THE GREAT TRUTHS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN WE ASSOCIATE REPETITION WITH BOREDOM GIVE US THE NEW WE 'RE ALWAYS SAYING
AlaindeBotton_2011G FIVE TIMES BECAUSE WHAT SHE SAYS IS SO CLEVER
AlaindeBotton_2011G YOU 'D FEEL CHEATED NOT SO IF YOU 'RE ADOPTING A RELIGIOUS MINDSET
AlaindeBotton_2011G THE OTHER THINGS THAT RELIGIONS DO IS TO ARRANGE TIME
AlaindeBotton_2011G ALL THE MAJOR RELIGIONS GIVE US CALENDARS WHAT IS A CALENDAR A CALENDAR IS A WAY OF MAKING SURE THAT ACROSS THE YEAR YOU WILL BUMP INTO CERTAIN VERY IMPORTANT IDEAS IN THE
AlaindeBotton_2011G NONSENSE SAYS THE RELIGIOUS WORLD VIEW RELIGIOUS VIEW SAYS WE NEED CALENDARS WE NEED TO STRUCTURE TIME WE NEED TO SYNCHRONIZE ENCOUNTERS THIS COMES ACROSS ALSO IN THE WAY IN WHICH RELIGIONS SET UP RITUALS AROUND IMPORTANT FEELINGS TAKE THE MOON
AlaindeBotton_2011G BUT IF YOU 'RE A ZEN BUDDHIST IN THE MIDDLE OF SEPTEMBER YOU WILL BE ORDERED OUT OF YOUR HOME MADE TO STAND ON A CANONICAL PLATFORM AND MADE TO CELEBRATE THE FESTIVAL OF TSUKIMI WHERE YOU WILL BE GIVEN POEMS TO READ IN HONOR OF THE MOON AND THE PASSAGE OF TIME AND THE FRAILTY OF LIFE THAT IT SHOULD REMIND US OF YOU 'LL BE HANDED RICE CAKES
AlaindeBotton_2011G AND THE MOON AND THE REFLECTION ON THE MOON WILL HAVE A SECURE PLACE IN YOUR HEART
AlaindeBotton_2011G THAT 'S VERY GOOD THE OTHER THING THAT RELIGIONS ARE REALLY AWARE OF IS SPEAK WELL I 'M NOT DOING A VERY GOOD JOB OF THIS HERE BUT ORATORY ORATORY IS ABSOLUTELY KEY TO RELIGIONS IN THE SECULAR WORLD YOU CAN COME THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND BE A LOUSY SPEAKER AND STILL HAVE A GREAT CAREER
AlaindeBotton_2011G BUT THE RELIGIOUS WORLD DOESN 'T THINK THAT WAY WHAT YOU 'RE SAYING NEEDS TO BE BACKED UP BY A REALLY CONVINCING WAY OF SAYING IT SO IF YOU GO TO AN AFRICAN AMERICAN PENTECOSTALIST CHURCH IN THE AMERICAN SOUTH
AlaindeBotton_2011G AND YOU LISTEN TO HOW THEY TALK MY GOODNESS THEY TALK WELL AFTER EVERY CONVINCING POINT PEOPLE WILL GO AMEN AMEN AMEN AT THE END OF A REALLY ROUSING PARAGRAPH THEY 'LL ALL STAND UP AND THEY 'LL GO THANK YOU JESUS THANK YOU CHRIST THANK YOU SAVIOR IF WE WERE DOING IT LIKE THEY DO IT LET 'S NOT DO IT
AlaindeBotton_2011G SO IN ORTHODOX JEWISH COMMUNITIES EVERY FRIDAY YOU GO TO A MIKVEH YOU IMMERSE YOURSELF IN THE WATER AND A PHYSICAL ACTION BACKS UP A PHILOSOPHICAL IDEA WE DON 'T TEND TO DO THAT OUR IDEAS ARE IN ONE AREA AND OUR BEHAVIOR WITH OUR BODIES IS IN ANOTHER RELIGIONS ARE FASCINATING IN THE WAY THEY TRY AND COMBINE THE TWO LET 'S LOOK AT ART NOW
AlaindeBotton_2011G NOW ART IS SOMETHING THAT IN THE SECULAR WORLD WE THINK VERY HIGHLY OF WE THINK ART IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT A LOT OF OUR SURPLUS WEALTH GOES TO MUSEUMS ETC WE SOMETIMES HEAR IT SAID THAT MUSEUMS ARE OUR NEW CATHEDRALS OR OUR NEW CHURCHES YOU 'VE HEARD THAT SAYING
AlaindeBotton_2011G NOW I THINK THAT THE POTENTIAL IS THERE BUT WE 'VE COMPLETELY LET OURSELVES DOWN AND THE REASON WE 'VE LET OURSELVES DOWN IS THAT WE 'RE NOT PROPERLY STUDYING HOW RELIGIONS HANDLE ART
AlaindeBotton_2011G THE TWO REALLY BAD IDEAS THAT ARE HOVERING IN THE MODERN WORLD THAT INHIBIT OUR CAPACITY TO DRAW STRENGTH FROM ART THE FIRST IDEA IS THAT ART SHOULD BE FOR ART 'S SAKE A RIDICULOUS IDEA AN IDEA THAT ART SHOULD LIVE IN A HERMETIC BUBBLE AND SHOULD NOT TRY TO DO ANYTHING WITH THIS TROUBLED WORLD I COULDN 'T DISAGREE MORE
AlaindeBotton_2011G THE OTHER THING THAT WE BELIEVE IS THAT ART SHOULDN 'T EXPLAIN ITSELF
AlaindeBotton_2011G THAT ARTISTS SHOULDN 'T SAY WHAT THEY 'RE UP TO BECAUSE IF THEY SAID IT IT MIGHT DESTROY THE SPELL AND WE MIGHT FIND IT TOO EASY THAT 'S WHY A VERY COMMON FEELING WHEN YOU 'RE IN A MUSEUM LET 'S ADMIT IT IS I DON 'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT
AlaindeBotton_2011G BUT IF WE 'RE SERIOUS PEOPLE WE DON 'T ADMIT TO THAT BUT THAT FEELING OF PUZZLEMENT
AlaindeBotton_2011G AND SECONDLY IT 'S TRYING TO REMIND YOU OF WHAT THERE IS TO FEAR AND TO HATE
AlaindeBotton_2011G AND THAT 'S WHAT ART IS ART IS A VISCERAL ENCOUNTER WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS OF YOUR FAITH SO AS YOU WALK AROUND A CHURCH OR A MOSQUE OR A CATHEDRAL WHAT YOU 'RE TRYING TO IMBIBE WHAT YOU 'RE IMBIBING IS THROUGH YOUR EYES THROUGH YOUR SENSES TRUTHS THAT HAVE OTHERWISE COME TO YOU THROUGH YOUR MIND
AlaindeBotton_2011G ESSENTIALLY IT 'S PROPAGANDA REMBRANDT IS A PROPAGANDIST
AlaindeBotton_2011G IN THE CHRISTIAN VIEW NOW THE WORD PROPAGANDA SETS OFF ALARM BELLS WE THINK OF HITLER WE THINK OF STALIN DON 'T NECESSARILY PROPAGANDA IS A MANNER OF BEING DIDACTIC IN HONOR OF SOMETHING AND IF THAT THING IS GOOD THERE 'S NO PROBLEM WITH IT AT ALL
AlaindeBotton_2011G MY VIEW IS THAT MUSEUMS SHOULD TAKE A LEAF OUT OF THE BOOK OF RELIGIONS
AlaindeBotton_2011G AND THEY SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU WALK INTO A MUSEUM IF I WAS A MUSEUM CURATOR
AlaindeBotton_2011G MIS FOUNDED IDEAS ART SHOULD BE ONE OF THE TOOLS BY WHICH WE IMPROVE OUR SOCIETY ART SHOULD BE DIDACTIC
AlaindeBotton_2011G LET 'S THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE
AlaindeBotton_2011G THE PEOPLE IN THE MODERN WORLD IN THE SECULAR WORLD WHO ARE INTERESTED IN MATTERS OF THE SPIRIT IN MATTERS OF THE MIND IN HIGHER SOUL LIKE CONCERNS TEND TO BE ISOLATED INDIVIDUALS THEY 'RE POETS THEY 'RE PHILOSOPHERS THEY 'RE PHOTOGRAPHERS THEY 'RE FILMMAKERS AND THEY TEND TO BE ON THEIR OWN THEY 'RE OUR COTTAGE INDUSTRIES THEY ARE VULNERABLE SINGLE PEOPLE
AlaindeBotton_2011G AND THEY GET DEPRESSED AND THEY GET SAD ON THEIR OWN
AlaindeBotton_2011G AND THEY DON 'T REALLY CHANGE MUCH NOW THINK ABOUT RELIGIONS THINK ABOUT ORGANIZED RELIGIONS WHAT DO ORGANIZED RELIGIONS DO THEY GROUP TOGETHER THEY FORM INSTITUTIONS AND THAT HAS ALL SORTS OF ADVANTAGES
AlaindeBotton_2011G FIRST OF ALL SCALE MIGHT
AlaindeBotton_2011G THE CATHOLIC CHURCH PULLED IN NINETY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR ACCORDING TO THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THESE ARE MASSIVE MACHINES THEY 'RE COLLABORATIVE THEY 'RE BRANDED THEY 'RE MULTINATIONAL AND THEY 'RE HIGHLY DISCIPLINED THESE ARE ALL VERY GOOD QUALITIES WE RECOGNIZE THEM IN RELATION TO CORPORATIONS
AlaindeBotton_2011G AND CORPORATIONS ARE VERY LIKE RELIGIONS IN MANY WAYS EXCEPT THEY 'RE RIGHT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PYRAMID OF NEEDS THEY 'RE SELLING US SHOES AND CARS
AlaindeBotton_2011G THE THERAPISTS THE POETS ARE ON THEIR OWN AND THEY HAVE NO POWER THEY HAVE NO MIGHT
AlaindeBotton_2011G SO RELIGIONS ARE THE FOREMOST EXAMPLE OF AN INSTITUTION THAT IS FIGHTING FOR THE THINGS OF THE MIND NOW WE MAY NOT AGREE WITH WHAT RELIGIONS ARE TRYING TO TEACH US BUT WE CAN ADMIRE THE INSTITUTIONAL WAY IN WHICH THEY 'RE DOING IT
AlaindeBotton_2011G BOOKS ALONE BOOKS WRITTEN BY LONE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING WE NEED TO GROUP TOGETHER IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD YOU HAVE TO GROUP TOGETHER YOU HAVE TO BE COLLABORATIVE AND THAT 'S WHAT RELIGIONS DO THEY ARE MULTINATIONAL AS I SAY THEY ARE BRANDED THEY HAVE A CLEAR IDENTITY SO THEY DON 'T GET LOST IN A BUSY WORLD
AlaindeBotton_2011G FOR MANY OF YOU WHO ARE OPERATING IN A RANGE OF DIFFERENT FIELDS THERE IS SOMETHING TO LEARN FROM THE EXAMPLE OF RELIGION EVEN IF YOU DON 'T BELIEVE ANY OF IT
AlaindeBotton_2011G IF YOU 'RE INVOLVED IN ANYTHING THAT 'S COMMUNAL THAT INVOLVES LOTS OF PEOPLE GETTING TOGETHER THERE ARE THINGS FOR YOU IN RELIGION
AlaindeBotton_2011G IF YOU 'RE INVOLVED SAY IN A TRAVEL INDUSTRY IN ANY WAY LOOK AT PILGRIMAGE LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT PILGRIMAGE WE HAVEN 'T BEGUN TO SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF WHAT TRAVEL COULD BE BECAUSE WE HAVEN 'T LOOKED AT WHAT RELIGIONS DO WITH TRAVEL IF YOU 'RE IN THE ART WORLD LOOK AT THE EXAMPLE OF WHAT RELIGIONS ARE DOING WITH ART
AlaindeBotton_2011G AND IF YOU 'RE AN EDUCATOR IN ANY WAY AGAIN LOOK AT HOW RELIGIONS ARE SPREADING IDEAS YOU MAY NOT AGREE WITH THE IDEAS BUT MY GOODNESS THEY 'RE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE MECHANISMS FOR DOING SO
AlaindeBotton_2011G SO REALLY MY CONCLUDING POINT IS YOU MAY NOT AGREE WITH RELIGION BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY RELIGIONS ARE SO SUBTLE SO COMPLICATED SO INTELLIGENT IN MANY WAYS THAT THEY 'RE NOT FIT TO BE ABANDONED TO THE RELIGIOUS ALONE THEY 'RE FOR ALL OF US THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AlaindeBotton_2011G ONE ASPECT OF RELIGION THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT SAY YOUR AGENDA COULD BORROW FROM WHICH IS THIS SENSE THAT 'S ACTUALLY PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO ANYONE WHO 'S RELIGIOUS OF
AlaindeBotton_2011G AND THEY SAY SO AREN 'T YOU SORT OF RELIGIOUS AND I GO NO WHY DOES THAT SENSE OF MYSTERY THAT SENSE OF THE DIZZYING SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE NEED TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY A MYSTICAL FEELING SCIENCE AND
AlaindeBotton_2011G JUST OBSERVATION GIVES US THAT FEELING WITHOUT IT SO I DON 'T FEEL THE NEED THE UNIVERSE IS LARGE AND WE ARE TINY WITHOUT THE NEED FOR FURTHER
AlaindeBotton_2011G RELIGIOUS SUPERSTRUCTURE SO ONE CAN HAVE SO CALLED SPIRITUAL MOMENTS WITHOUT BELIEF IN THE SPIRIT
AlaindeBotton_2011G IS THERE AN EQUIVALENT
AlaindeBotton_2011G PROCESS BY WHICH THERE 'S A SORT OF BRIDGE BETWEEN WHAT YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT YOU WOULD SAY TO THEM
AlaindeBotton_2011G FROM ALL THESE VERY GOOD THINGS IT 'S SO SAD THAT WE CONSTANTLY SAY I DON 'T BELIEVE SO I CAN 'T HAVE COMMUNITY SO I 'M CUT OFF FROM MORALITY SO I CAN 'T GO ON A PILGRIMAGE ONE WANTS TO SAY NONSENSE WHY NOT AND THAT 'S REALLY THE SPIRIT OF MY TALK THERE 'S SO MUCH WE CAN ABSORB ATHEISM SHOULDN 'T CUT ITSELF OFF FROM THE RICH SOURCES OF RELIGION
AlaindeBotton_2011G BUT PROBABLY MOST PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY CERTAINLY DON 'T THINK THAT RELIGION IS GOING AWAY ANY TIME SOON AND WANT TO FIND THE LANGUAGE TO HAVE A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE AND TO FEEL LIKE WE CAN ACTUALLY TALK TO EACH OTHER AND AT LEAST SHARE SOME THINGS IN COMMON ARE WE
AlaindeBotton_2011G FOOLISH TO BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A WORLD WHERE INSTEAD OF RELIGION BEING THE GREAT RALLYING CRY OF DIVIDE AND WAR THAT THERE COULD BE BRIDGING
AlaindeBotton_2011G WE 'RE ALL VERY SUSPICIOUS OF IS INDIVIDUAL LEADERS IT DOESN 'T NEED IT WHAT I 'VE TRIED TO LAY OUT IS A FRAMEWORK AND I 'M HOPING THAT PEOPLE CAN JUST
AlaindeBotton_2011G FILL IT IN I 'VE SKETCHED A SORT OF BROAD FRAMEWORK BUT WHEREVER YOU ARE AS I SAY IF YOU 'RE IN THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY DO THAT TRAVEL BIT IF YOU 'RE IN THE COMMUNAL INDUSTRY LOOK AT RELIGION AND DO THE COMMUNAL BIT SO IT 'S A WIKI PROJECT
AlaindeBotton_2011G THANK YOU FOR SPARKING
