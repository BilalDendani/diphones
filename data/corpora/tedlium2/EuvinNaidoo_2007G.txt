EuvinNaidoo_2007G WE'VE ALL HEARD THESE THINGS BUT THIS IS ABOUT AFRICA THE STORY WE HAVE NOT HEARD
EuvinNaidoo_2007G THE STORIES THAT WE WANT TO KNOW AND THE STORIES THAT DO EXIST ABOUT POSITIVE TALES A PART OF MY
EuvinNaidoo_2007G TALK IS GOING TO BE ABOUT INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT EXIST ON THIS CONTINENT TO SEPARATE THE RHETORIC FROM THE REALITY THE FACT FROM THE FICTION
EuvinNaidoo_2007G TO GO TO THE ACTUAL DATA AND STATISTICS THAT EXIST ABOUT THE ACTUAL THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING ON THE GROUND THAT MAKE AFRICA
EuvinNaidoo_2007G A REALISTIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY AND OPTION FOR YOU SO LET 'S GET GOING BECAUSE AFRICA TO SOME DEGREE IS ON A TURNAROUND
EuvinNaidoo_2007G A TURNAROUND IN TERMS OF HOW IT MANAGES ITS IMAGE AND HOW IT TAKES CONTROL OF ITS OWN DESTINY
EuvinNaidoo_2007G AND TURNAROUNDS ARE PART AND PARCEL OF WHAT I HAVE FOCUSED ON FOR MOST OF MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER AND IT ALL STARTED ALMOST A DECADE AGO
EuvinNaidoo_2007G AS A YOUNG CONSULTANT AT MCKINSEY COMPANY AT THEIR FIRST AFRICAN OFFICE IN JOHANNESBURG AND THERE WE WORKED WITH LEADING CEOS
EuvinNaidoo_2007G ON AFRICAN ISSUES AND AFRICAN COMPANIES ON TURNAROUNDS MAKING THE COMPANIES NOT JUST THE BEST IN AFRICA BUT THE BEST
EuvinNaidoo_2007G BUT I REALLY FORMALIZED THIS FOCUS ON TURNAROUNDS WHEN I WAS COMPLETING MY MBA IN THE UNITED STATES IT ALL BEGAN WITH A FANTASTIC PHONE CALL IT WAS FROM ROSABETH MOSS KANTER
EuvinNaidoo_2007G HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL GURU AND A PROFESSOR OF MINE AND SHE SAID I WANT TO WRITE A CASE EUVIN A CASE ON A PUBLIC SECTOR LEADER THAT HAS LESSONS FOR THE CORPORATE WORLD
EuvinNaidoo_2007G AND THE LEADER THAT CAME TO MIND WAS NELSON MANDELA
EuvinNaidoo_2007G AS HE TOOK OVER POWER AS THE FIRST DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA FACED A SITUATION OF A COUNTRY THAT COULD HAVE SLID INTO THE ABYSS OF CHAOS BUT HE STARTED THE COUNTRY ON A PATH OF A POSITIVE CYCLE
EuvinNaidoo_2007G NOW THE CASE NELSON MANDELA CHANGE LEADER BECAME PART OF THE RESEARCH BASE FOR A CHAPTER IN ROSABETH 'S NEW BOOK CALLED CONFIDENCE
EuvinNaidoo_2007G AND CONFIDENCE BECAME A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER AND TOPPED BUSINESS WEEK 'S HARDCOVER BESTSELLER LIST AND WHY I TELL YOU THIS STORY
EuvinNaidoo_2007G IS BECAUSE LATER WHEN I WAS INTERVIEWED ON SABC AFRICA ON A PAN AFRICAN BROADCAST THEY ASKED WHAT IS YOUR KEY LESSON OR THE KEY THING YOU ENJOY THE MOST BECAUSE IT WAS A HUGE PRIVILEGE TO BE PART OF SUCH A PROJECT
EuvinNaidoo_2007G THE LESSON FROM THAT WAS THAT IT WAS AFRICA AN AFRICAN STORY THAT WAS USED TO SHARE NEWS WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD
EuvinNaidoo_2007G OF WHAT THE BENCHMARK CAN BE FOR CORPORATE TURNAROUNDS AFRICA WAS BEING USED AS A SUCCESS STORY
EuvinNaidoo_2007G I FOUND MYSELF FROM THE SOUTHERN PART OF AFRICA IN SOUTH AFRICA AT THE VERY NORTH IN EGYPT AND I SOUGHT OUT THE MOST REMOTE PLACES
EuvinNaidoo_2007G I WENT TO THE SIWA OASIS THAT WAS ONE OF MY STOPS AND THE SIWA OASIS IS FAMOUS FOR SEVERAL THINGS BUT THE KEY THING IS THAT IT WAS THE PLACE THAT ALEXANDER THE GREAT
EuvinNaidoo_2007G WENT TO WHEN HE WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT HIS DESTINY HAD IN STORE FOR HIM AND LEGEND HAS IT THAT ALEXANDER TREKKED THROUGH THIS DESERT
EuvinNaidoo_2007G THIS WAS THREE HUNDRED BC SO AFRICA HAD LONG BEEN SEEN AS A PLACE TO GO TO FOR ANSWERS NOW THE THING I REMEMBER ABOUT SIWA
EuvinNaidoo_2007G TO TWO THOUSAND AND TWO I'M SITTING IN CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS AT THE HEALTHCARE DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE AND I SEE THE SAME PICTURE BUT FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE
EuvinNaidoo_2007G A SATELLITE PICTURE LOOKING DOWN AT THE
EuvinNaidoo_2007G AND IT WAS THAT PICTURE THAT MADE SUCH AN PROFOUND IMPACT ON ME BECAUSE I'LL NEVER FORGET IT I REMEMBER THE VERY MOMENT AND I WANTED TO SHARE THAT IMAGE WITH YOU OF WHAT I SAW AT THAT POINT
EuvinNaidoo_2007G THE FIRST THING THAT I SAW WAS NORTH AMERICA
EuvinNaidoo_2007G IN ALL ITS GLORY A WARM FEELING
EuvinNaidoo_2007G LIGHT AND THEN I SAW
EuvinNaidoo_2007G AFRICA QUITE LITERALLY THE
EuvinNaidoo_2007G AND WHILE AFRICA MAY BE DARK THE THING THAT BROUGHT
EuvinNaidoo_2007G THE MESSAGE HOME TO ME WAS THAT THIS IS THE CHALLENGE WE ARE FACING BUT IT'S ALSO THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE WHILST AFRICA MAY BE DARK OTHER THAN THE FEW SPECKS
EuvinNaidoo_2007G THAT EXIST NORTH AND IN THE SOUTH AND OTHER AREAS IT'S AGLOW WITH THE LIGHT IN THE HEARTS OF THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE ENTREPRENEURS DYNAMIC PEOPLE PEOPLE WITH HOPE
EuvinNaidoo_2007G WAS GEORGE KIMBLE THE GEOGRAPHER WHO SAID THAT THE ONLY THING DARK ABOUT AFRICA IS OUR IGNORANCE
EuvinNaidoo_2007G SO LET 'S START SHEDDING LIGHT ON THIS AMAZING ECLECTIC CONTINENT THAT HAS SO MUCH TO OFFER LET 'S START UNPACKING IT
EuvinNaidoo_2007G AFRICA IS THE SECOND LARGEST CONTINENT A LAND MASS SECOND FROM ASIA IT ALSO IS THE SECOND MOST POPULATED CONTINENT WITH NINE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE
EuvinNaidoo_2007G IN FACT COMING BACK TO THE LAND MASS AFRICA IS SO BIG THAT YOU COULD FIT IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES CHINA AND THE ENTIRE EUROPE INTO AFRICA AND STILL HAVE SPACE
EuvinNaidoo_2007G AS AN INVESTMENT BANKER I'M IN THE CROSS FLOW OF INFORMATION AND THE CHANGES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE IN CAPITAL MARKETS SO I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THESE
EuvinNaidoo_2007G I CALL IT MY Z E N CLUSTER ZAMBIA FROM TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR TO TWO THOUSAND AND SIX MOVES FROM THE EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN INFLATION TO THE NINE PERCENT EGYPT FROM THE SIXTEEN PERCENT TO ABOUT EIGHT POINT FOUR PERCENT
EuvinNaidoo_2007G MORE FASCINATING YOU HAVE OTHER COUNTRIES SOUTH AFRICA MAURITIUS NAMIBIA ALL
EuvinNaidoo_2007G IN SINGLE DIGITS
EuvinNaidoo_2007G IS NOT A COUNTRY IT'S MADE UP IT'S MADE UP
EuvinNaidoo_2007G FIFTY THREE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES SO THE VERY DEFINITION TO SAY INVEST IN AFRICA IS A NO GO IT'S MEANINGLESS
EuvinNaidoo_2007G EACH COUNTRY HAS A UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION YOU CAN MAKE MONEY YOU CAN LOSE MONEY IN AFRICA BUT OPPORTUNITIES BOY OH BOY THEY EXIST AND THIS IS WHAT TODAY IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT DISCUSSING THOSE
EuvinNaidoo_2007G VERY OPPORTUNITIES SO LET 'S START GETTING INTO THE COUNTRIES AND INTO THE SPECIFIC MATERIAL AND DATA
EuvinNaidoo_2007G I WAS RECENTLY ELECTED AS EMEKA MENTIONED AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN AMERICA AND I'M VERY PROUD AND HAPPY TO BE IN THAT ROLE BECAUSE IT IS A FASCINATING POSITION TO BE IN
EuvinNaidoo_2007G OTHER HEADLINES THAT HAVE RECENTLY REACHED SOUTH AFRICA WERE BAIN CAPITAL AND KKR THE BIG BOYS OF PRIVATE EQUITY HEADLINE IN SOUTH AFRICA THEY HAVE LANDED QUITE OMINOUS
EuvinNaidoo_2007G WHAT WERE THEY THERE FOR TO ACQUIRE ASSETS BING CAPITAL 'S ACQUISITION OF EDCON A LARGE RETAILER

EuvinNaidoo_2007G BUT WITH AFRICA LET 'S START BEING CAREFUL ABOUT THIS AND EMEKA AND I HAVE HAD THESE DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE TO MOVE AWAY FROM WHAT'S CALLED THE CURSE OF THE COMMODITIES

EuvinNaidoo_2007G IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE THE EGYPTIAN STOCK MARKET STOCK EXCHANGE RETURNED OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE PERCENT
EuvinNaidoo_2007G BUT IN ANY INVESTMENT DECISION THE KEY QUESTION IS WHAT IS MY ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT
EuvinNaidoo_2007G AN OVERHANG OF CAPITAL IN THE U S AND THE KEY IS YIELD PICKUP WHAT AFRICA IS PROVIDING IS A DIVERSIFICATION PLAY AND ALSO OPPORTUNITIES FOR YIELD PICKUP FOR THE INVESTOR THAT'S AWARE OF WHAT HE OR SHE IS DOING
