EuvinNaidoo_2007G@117.71:123.97 A TURNAROUND IN TERMS OF HOW IT MANAGES ITS IMAGE AND HOW IT TAKES CONTROL OF ITS OWN DESTINY
EuvinNaidoo_2007G@124.83:132.92 AND TURNAROUNDS ARE PART AND PARCEL OF WHAT I HAVE FOCUSED ON FOR MOST OF MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER AND IT ALL STARTED ALMOST A DECADE AGO

EuvinNaidoo_2007G@230.12:237.64 OF WHAT THE BENCHMARK CAN BE FOR CORPORATE TURNAROUNDS AFRICA WAS BEING USED AS A SUCCESS STORY
