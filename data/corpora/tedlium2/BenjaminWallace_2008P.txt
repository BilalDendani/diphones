BenjaminWallace_2008P@16.61:18.40 TO PLAY A BRIEF VIDEO CLIP

BenjaminWallace_2008P@52.92:64.53 ABOUT ALL THE VIDEOTAPE THAT REMAINS OF AN EVENT THAT SET OFF THE LONGEST RUNNING MYSTERY IN THE MODERN WINE WORLD AND THE MYSTERY EXISTED BECAUSE OF A GENTLEMAN NAMED HARDY RODENSTOCK
BenjaminWallace_2008P@81.20:88.95 HE WOULDN'T REVEAL THE EXACT NUMBER OF BOTTLES HE WOULD NOT REVEALEXACTLY WHERE THE BUILDING WAS AND HE WOULD NOT REVEAL EXACTLY WHO OWNED THE BUILDING
BenjaminWallace_2008P@89.11:96.83 THE MYSTERY PERSISTED FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS IT FINALLY BEGAN TO GET RESOLVED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE BECAUSE OF THIS
BenjaminWallace_2008P@97.54:108.40 BILL KOCH IS A FLORIDA BILLIONAIRE WHO OWNS FOUR OF THE JEFFERSON BOTTLES AND HE BECAME SUSPICIOUS AND HE ENDED UP SPENDING OVER A MILLION DOLLARS AND HIRING EX FBI AND EX SCOTLAND YARD AGENTS TO
BenjaminWallace_2008P@120.95:128.49 EMINENT AND ACCOMPLISHED FIGURES IN THE WINE WORLD WERE SORT OF DRAWN INTO THE ORBIT OF THESE BOTTLES I THINK THEY WANTED TO BELIEVE
BenjaminWallace_2008P@128.66:136.94 THAT THE MOST EXPENSIVE BOTTLE OF WINE IN THE WORLD MUST BE THE BEST BOTTLE OF WINE IN THE WORLD MUST BE THE RAREST BOTTLE OF WINE IN THE WORLD I BECAME
BenjaminWallace_2008P@152.15:164.87 WITH THE GENEROUS BACKING OF A MAGAZINE I WRITE FOR SOMETIMES I DECIDED TO SAMPLE THE VERY BEST OR MOST EXPENSIVE OR MOST COVETED ITEM IN ABOUT A DOZEN CATEGORIES WHICH WAS A VERY GRUELING QUEST AS YOU
BenjaminWallace_2008P@211.40:220.52 FOR SOME REASON POSED HIS DOG IN A LOT OF THEM SO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THIS RECURRING CHARACTER WHICH I GUESS YOU KNOW COMMUNICATES TO YOU THAT I DID NOT THINK THAT ONE WAS REALLY WORTH THE
BenjaminWallace_2008P@223.16:233.77 WHITE TRUFFLES ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE LUXURY FOODS BY WEIGHT IN THE WORLD TO TRY THIS I WENT TO A MARIO BATALI RESTAURANT IN MANHATTAN DEL POSTO THE WAITER YOU KNOW CAME OUT WITH THE WHITE TRUFFLE KNOB AND
BenjaminWallace_2008P@233.95:238.93 HIS SHAVER AND HE SHAVED IT ONTO MY PASTA AND HE SAID YOU KNOW WOULD SIGNORE LIKE THE TRUFFLES AND
BenjaminWallace_2008P@239.24:246.01 THE CHARM OF WHITE TRUFFLES IS IN THEIR AROMA IT'S NOT IN THEIR TASTE REALLY IT'S NOT IN THEIR TEXTURE IT'S IN THE SMELL THESE WHITE
BenjaminWallace_2008P@257.95:267.05 THAT YOU KNOW THEIR PURPOSE HAD BEEN SERVED AND SO I'M AFRAID TO SAY THAT THIS WAS ALSO A DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME THERE WERE SEVERAL SEVERAL OF THESE ITEMS WERE DISAPPOINTMENTS
BenjaminWallace_2008P@301.30:311.48 THIS IS SOAP THAT'S MADE FROM SILVER NANOPARTICLES WHICH HAVE ANTIBACTERIAL PROPERTIES I WASHED MY FACE WITH THIS THIS MORNING IN PREPARATION FOR THIS
BenjaminWallace_2008P@312.76:318.39 AND IT YOU KNOW TICKLED A LITTLE BIT AND IT SMELLED GOOD BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT NOBODY HERE HAS COMPLIMENTED ME ON THE CLEANLINESS
BenjaminWallace_2008P@320.51:322.53 THEN AGAIN NOBODY HAS COMPLIMENTED ME ON THE

BenjaminWallace_2008P@336.35:345.11 I DON'T THINK THAT WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GETTING A COMPLIMENT SHOULD BE THE TEST OF SOMETHING 'S VALUE BUT I THINK IN THE CASE OF A FASHION ITEM AN ARTICLE OF CLOTHING THAT'S A REASONABLE BENCHMARK
BenjaminWallace_2008P@345.89:353.66 THAT SAID A LOT OF WORK GOES INTO THESE THEY ARE MADE FROM HANDPICKED ORGANIC ZIMBABWEAN COTTON THAT HAS BEEN SHUTTLE

BenjaminWallace_2008P@400.39:406.75 IT TASTED FINE IT TASTED INTERESTING IT WAS VERY GREEN IT WAS VERY PEPPERY BUT IN THE BLIND TASTE TEST IT CAME IN LAST
BenjaminWallace_2008P@415.64:418.15 WHICH HAD BEEN OXIDIZING NEXT TO MY STOVE FOR SIX MONTHS
BenjaminWallace_2008P@427.78:438.90 A RECURRING THEME IS THAT A LOT OF THESE THINGS ARE FROM JAPAN YOU'LL START TO NOTICE I DON'T PLAY GOLF SO I COULDN'T ACTUALLY ROAD TEST THESE BUT I DID INTERVIEW A GUY WHO OWNS THEM EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO MARKET THESE CLUBS
BenjaminWallace_2008P@439.56:451.47 THESE HAVE FOUR AXIS SHAFTS WHICH MINIMIZE LOSS OF CLUB SPEED AND THEREBY DRIVE THE BALL FARTHER BUT THEY'LL SAY LOOK YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GETTING FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF PERFORMANCE FROM THESE CLUBS YOU'RE PAYING FOR
BenjaminWallace_2008P@451.61:459.33 THE BLING THAT THEY'RE ENCRUSTED WITH GOLD AND PLATINUM THE GUY WHO I INTERVIEWED WHO OWNS THEM DID SAY THAT HE 'S GOTTEN A LOT OF PLEASURE OUT OF THEM SO

BenjaminWallace_2008P@530.46:538.09 AND TRANSMITS THE RESULTS VIA EMAIL TO YOUR DOCTOR IT'S ALMOST LIKE A HOME MEDICAL CENTER AND THAT IS THE DIRECTION THAT JAPANESE TOILET TECHNOLOGY IS
BenjaminWallace_2008P@538.76:549.18 THIS ONE DOES NOT HAVE THOSE BELLS AND WHISTLES BUT FOR PURE FUNCTIONALITY IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE BEST THE NEOREST SIX HUNDRED AND TO TRY THIS I COULDN'T GET A LOANER BUT
BenjaminWallace_2008P@550.60:557.24 I DID GO INTO THE MANHATTAN SHOWROOM OF THE MANUFACTURER TOTO AND THEY HAVE A BATHROOM OFF OF THE SHOWROOM THAT YOU CAN USE WHICH I

BenjaminWallace_2008P@566.91:579.93 IT FLUSHES BY ITSELF THE LID CLOSES IT SELF CLEANS NOT ONLY IS IT A TECHNOLOGICAL LEAP FORWARD BUT I REALLY DO BELIEVE IT'S A BIT OF A CULTURAL LEAP FORWARD I MEAN A NO HANDS NO TOILET PAPER TOILET AND I WANT TO GET ONE OF THESE
BenjaminWallace_2008P@584.39:586.47 I COULD NOT GET A LOANER OF
BenjaminWallace_2008P@588.17:594.80 TOM CRUISE SUPPOSEDLY OWNS THIS BED THERE'S A LITTLE PLAQUE ON THE END THAT YOU KNOW EACH BUYER GETS THEIR NAME ENGRAVED ON IT
BenjaminWallace_2008P@601.29:606.50 TO TRY THIS ONE THE MAKER OF IT LET ME AND MY WIFE SPEND THE NIGHT IN THE MANHATTAN SHOWROOM LIGHTS
BenjaminWallace_2008P@618.45:619.97 THIS WAS A FUN ONE
BenjaminWallace_2008P@621.03:629.13 THIS IS THE FASTEST STREET LEGAL CAR IN THE WORLD AND THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRODUCTION CAR I GOT TO DRIVE THIS WITH A CHAPERONE FROM THE COMPANY
BenjaminWallace_2008P@646.89:653.99 I GET UP TO EIGHTY THEY START TO RATTLE I SWITCHED LANES ON THE HIGHWAY AND THE DRIVER THIS CHAPERONE SAID YOU KNOW YOU WERE JUST GOING ONE HUNDRED AND TEN MILES AN HOUR
BenjaminWallace_2008P@654.32:660.57 AND I HAD NO IDEA THAT I WAS ONE OF THOSE OBNOXIOUS PEOPLE YOU OCCASIONALLY SEE WEAVING IN AND OUT OF TRAFFIC BECAUSE IT WAS JUST THAT SMOOTH AND IF I WAS A
BenjaminWallace_2008P@667.16:675.30 THIS IS A COMPLETELY GRATUITOUS VIDEO I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW OF ONE OF THE PITFALLS OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY THIS IS TOM CRUISE ARRIVING AT THE MISSION IMPOSSIBLE
BenjaminWallace_2008P@701.21:706.44 AND CHEVAL BLANC IS KIND OF AN UNUSUAL WINE FOR BORDEAUX IN HAVING A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF
BenjaminWallace_2008P@717.17:723.63 THAT EVENTUALLY KIND OF GAVE IT THIS CULTISH FOLLOWING BUT IT'S SIXTY YEARS OLD THERE'S NOT MUCH OF IT LEFT
BenjaminWallace_2008P@724.08:733.48 WHAT THERE IS OF IT LEFT YOU DON'T KNOW IF IT'S REAL IT'S CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST FAKED WINE IN THE WORLD NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO POP OPEN THEIR ONE REMAINING BOTTLE FOR A JOURNALIST
BenjaminWallace_2008P@733.92:743.45 SO I'D ABOUT GIVEN UP TRYING TO GET MY HANDS ON ONE OF THESE I'D PUT OUT FEELERS TO RETAILERS TO AUCTIONEERS AND IT WAS COMING UP EMPTY AND THEN I GOT AN EMAIL FROM A GUY NAMED
BenjaminWallace_2008P@745.59:754.02 IS A UC RIVERSIDE THEORETICAL PHYSICIST WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE THE PREEMINENT ORGANIZER OF RARE WINE TASTINGS AND HE SAID I 'VE GOT A
BenjaminWallace_2008P@764.59:775.65 AND IT WAS AN INVITATION YOU DO NOT REFUSE I WENT IT WAS THREE DAYS FOUR MEALS AND AT LUNCH ON SATURDAY WE OPENED THE FORTY SEVEN AND
BenjaminWallace_2008P@801.47:811.93 CALL MY PALATE A PHILISTINE PALATE SO IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN SOMETHING THAT I WASN'T IMPRESSED BUT I WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE THERE WHO HAD THAT REACTION AND IT WASN'T JUST TO THAT WINE
BenjaminWallace_2008P@812.28:819.54 ANY ONE OF THE WINES SERVED AT THIS TASTING IF I'D BEEN SERVED IT AT A DINNER PARTY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW THE WINE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFETIME AND INCREDIBLY
BenjaminWallace_2008P@820.13:829.11 MEMORABLE BUT DRINKING SIXTY GREAT WINES OVER THREE DAYS THEY ALL JUST BLURRED TOGETHER AND IT BECAME ALMOST A GRUELING EXPERIENCE
BenjaminWallace_2008P@829.60:838.64 AND I JUST WANTED TO FINISH BY MENTIONING A VERY INTERESTING STUDY WHICH CAME OUT EARLIER THIS YEAR FROM SOME RESEARCHERS AT STANFORD AND CALTECH AND
BenjaminWallace_2008P@839.65:853.45 THEY GAVE SUBJECTS THE SAME WINE LABELED WITH DIFFERENT PRICE TAGS A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW SAID THAT THEY LIKED THE MORE EXPENSIVE WINE MORE IT WAS THE SAME WINE BUT THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A DIFFERENT ONE THAT WAS MORE EXPENSIVE BUT WHAT WAS UNEXPECTED WAS THAT
BenjaminWallace_2008P@853.97:861.61 THESE RESEARCHERS DID MRI BRAIN IMAGING WHILE THE PEOPLE WERE DRINKING THE WINE AND NOT ONLY DID THEY SAY THEY ENJOYED THE MORE EXPENSIVELY LABELED WINE MORE
BenjaminWallace_2008P@861.90:869.38 THEIR BRAIN ACTUALLY REGISTERED AS EXPERIENCING MORE PLEASURE FROM THE SAME WINE WHEN IT WAS LABELED WITH A HIGHER PRICE TAG THANK YOU
