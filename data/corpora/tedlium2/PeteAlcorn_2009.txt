PeteAlcorn_2009 EXPLODING POPULATION SMALL PLANET IT 'S GOING TO LEAD TO UGLY THINGS BUT I 'M MOVING PAST MALTHUS BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE JUST MIGHT BE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS FROM A KIND OF NEW ENLIGHTENMENT
PeteAlcorn_2009 MOST OF THE ECONOMIC MODELS ARE BUILT AROUND SCARCITY AND GROWTH SO A LOT OF ECONOMISTS LOOK AT DECLINING POPULATION AND EXPECT TO SEE STAGNATION MAYBE DEPRESSION
PeteAlcorn_2009 BUT A DECLINING POPULATION IS GOING TO HAVE AT LEAST TWO VERY BENEFICIAL ECONOMIC EFFECTS
PeteAlcorn_2009 MAKE INVESTING IN PROPERTY A BAD BET
PeteAlcorn_2009 IN THE CITIES A LOT OF THE COST OF PROPERTY IS ACTUALLY WRAPPED UP IN ITS SPECULATIVE VALUE
PeteAlcorn_2009 TAKE AWAY LAND SPECULATION
PeteAlcorn_2009 PRICE OF LAND DROPS
PeteAlcorn_2009 AND THAT BEGINS TO LIFT A HEAVY BURDEN OFF THE WORLD 'S POOR
PeteAlcorn_2009 MEANS SCARCE LABOR SCARCE LABOR DRIVES WAGES AS WAGES INCREASE THAT ALSO LIFTS THE BURDEN ON THE POOR AND THE WORKING CLASS
PeteAlcorn_2009 NOW I 'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A RADICAL DROP IN POPULATION LIKE WE SAW IN THE BLACK DEATH BUT LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN EUROPE
PeteAlcorn_2009 AFTER THE PLAGUE RISING WAGES
PeteAlcorn_2009 ALL OF THE WESTERN RELIGIONS BEGIN WITH THE NOTION OF EDEN AND DESCEND THROUGH A KIND OF PROFLIGATE PRESENT TO A VERY UGLY FUTURE
PeteAlcorn_2009 SO HUMAN HISTORY IS VIEWED AS SORT OF THIS DOWNHILL SLIDE FROM THE GOOD OLD DAYS BUT I THINK WE 'RE IN FOR ANOTHER CHANGE ABOUT TWO GENERATIONS AFTER THE TOP OF THAT CURVE ONCE THE EFFECTS OF A DECLINING POPULATION START TO SETTLE IN
PeteAlcorn_2009 AT THAT POINT WE 'LL START ROMANTICIZING THE FUTURE AGAIN INSTEAD OF THE NASTY BRUTISH PAST
PeteAlcorn_2009 SO WHY DOES THIS MATTER WHY TALK ABOUT SOCIAL ECONOMIC MOVEMENTS THAT MAY BE MORE THAN A CENTURY AWAY BECAUSE TRANSITIONS ARE DANGEROUS TIMES WHEN LAND OWNERS START TO LOSE MONEY AND LABOR DEMANDS MORE PAY
PeteAlcorn_2009 THERE ARE SOME POWERFUL INTERESTS THAT ARE GOING TO FEAR FOR THE FUTURE FEAR FOR THE FUTURE LEADS TO SOME RASH DECISIONS IF WE HAVE A POSITIVE VIEW ABOUT THE FUTURE THEN WE MAY BE ABLE TO ACCELERATE THROUGH THAT TURN INSTEAD OF CAREENING OFF A CLIFF
