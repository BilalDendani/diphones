PeteAlcorn_2009@20.88:33.55 EXPLODING POPULATION SMALL PLANET IT 'S GOING TO LEAD TO UGLY THINGS BUT I 'M MOVING PAST MALTHUS BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE JUST MIGHT BE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS FROM A KIND OF NEW ENLIGHTENMENT
PeteAlcorn_2009@52.5:63.42 MOST OF THE ECONOMIC MODELS ARE BUILT AROUND SCARCITY AND GROWTH SO A LOT OF ECONOMISTS LOOK AT DECLINING POPULATION AND EXPECT TO SEE STAGNATION MAYBE DEPRESSION
PeteAlcorn_2009@63.78:69.87 BUT A DECLINING POPULATION IS GOING TO HAVE AT LEAST TWO VERY BENEFICIAL ECONOMIC EFFECTS
PeteAlcorn_2009@75.11:78.54 MAKE INVESTING IN PROPERTY A BAD BET
PeteAlcorn_2009@79.4:86.64 IN THE CITIES A LOT OF THE COST OF PROPERTY IS ACTUALLY WRAPPED UP IN ITS SPECULATIVE VALUE
PeteAlcorn_2009@86.91:89 TAKE AWAY LAND SPECULATION
PeteAlcorn_2009@89.16:90.84 PRICE OF LAND DROPS
PeteAlcorn_2009@90.94:95.12 AND THAT BEGINS TO LIFT A HEAVY BURDEN OFF THE WORLD 'S POOR
PeteAlcorn_2009@100.15:110.25 MEANS SCARCE LABOR SCARCE LABOR DRIVES WAGES AS WAGES INCREASE THAT ALSO LIFTS THE BURDEN ON THE POOR AND THE WORKING CLASS
PeteAlcorn_2009@111.17:117.13 NOW I 'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A RADICAL DROP IN POPULATION LIKE WE SAW IN THE BLACK DEATH BUT LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN EUROPE
PeteAlcorn_2009@117.63:120.84 AFTER THE PLAGUE RISING WAGES
PeteAlcorn_2009@143.1:151.86 ALL OF THE WESTERN RELIGIONS BEGIN WITH THE NOTION OF EDEN AND DESCEND THROUGH A KIND OF PROFLIGATE PRESENT TO A VERY UGLY FUTURE
PeteAlcorn_2009@152.62:168.9 SO HUMAN HISTORY IS VIEWED AS SORT OF THIS DOWNHILL SLIDE FROM THE GOOD OLD DAYS BUT I THINK WE 'RE IN FOR ANOTHER CHANGE ABOUT TWO GENERATIONS AFTER THE TOP OF THAT CURVE ONCE THE EFFECTS OF A DECLINING POPULATION START TO SETTLE IN
PeteAlcorn_2009@169.2:175.7 AT THAT POINT WE 'LL START ROMANTICIZING THE FUTURE AGAIN INSTEAD OF THE NASTY BRUTISH PAST
PeteAlcorn_2009@176.44:191.34 SO WHY DOES THIS MATTER WHY TALK ABOUT SOCIAL ECONOMIC MOVEMENTS THAT MAY BE MORE THAN A CENTURY AWAY BECAUSE TRANSITIONS ARE DANGEROUS TIMES WHEN LAND OWNERS START TO LOSE MONEY AND LABOR DEMANDS MORE PAY
PeteAlcorn_2009@191.53:207.07 THERE ARE SOME POWERFUL INTERESTS THAT ARE GOING TO FEAR FOR THE FUTURE FEAR FOR THE FUTURE LEADS TO SOME RASH DECISIONS IF WE HAVE A POSITIVE VIEW ABOUT THE FUTURE THEN WE MAY BE ABLE TO ACCELERATE THROUGH THAT TURN INSTEAD OF CAREENING OFF A CLIFF
