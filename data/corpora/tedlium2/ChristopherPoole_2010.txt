ChristopherPoole_2010 B IS THE FIRST BOARD WE STARTED WITH AND IT IS IN MANY WAYS THE BEATING HEART OF THE WEBSITE IT IS WHERE A THIRD OF ALL THE TRAFFIC IS GOING AND B IS KNOWN FOR
ChristopherPoole_2010 MORE THAN ANYTHING NOT JUST THE MEMES THEY'VE CREATED BUT THE EXPLOITS AND CHRIS JUST TOUCHED ON ONE OF THOSE A SECOND AGO AND THAT WAS
ChristopherPoole_2010 THE TIME ONE HUNDRED POLL SO SOMEBODY AT TIME AT THE MAGAZINE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN TO NOMINATE ME FOR THIS THING THEY DID LAST YEAR AND SO THEY PLACED ME ON IT AND THE INTERNET GOT WIND OF IT MY COMMUNITY
ChristopherPoole_2010 I DIDN'T INSTRUCT THEM TO DO IT THEY JUST DECIDED THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED AND SO YOU KNOW THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY PERCENT APPROVAL RATING AIN'T SO
ChristopherPoole_2010 BAD
ChristopherPoole_2010 SO THEY BROKE THAT
ChristopherPoole_2010 AND I ENDED UP ON TOP I ENDED UP AT THIS REALLY FANCY PARTY
ChristopherPoole_2010 BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IT'S THAT THEY WEREN'T PUTTING ME AT THE TOP OF THIS LIST THEY WERE ACTUALLY IT GOT SO SOPHISTICATED TO THE POINT WHERE THEY GAMED

ChristopherPoole_2010 SO WE'VE GOT THIS ACTIVIST GROUP THAT'S THIS GRASSROOTS GROUP THAT'S COME OUT OF THE SITE AND LAST I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE EXAMPLE THE STORY OF DUSTY THE CAT
ChristopherPoole_2010 IS THE NAME THAT WE'VE GIVEN TO THIS CAT THIS YOUNG MAN
ChristopherPoole_2010 FOR PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
ChristopherPoole_2010 SO WHAT THEY DID IS THEY I MEAN THEY PUT C S I TO SHAME HERE THE INTERNET DETECTIVES CAME OUT THEY MATCHED THEY FOUND HIS MYSPACE THEY TOOK THE YOUTUBE VIDEO AND THEY MASHED EVERYTHING IN THE VIDEO AND WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY HAD HIS NAME
ChristopherPoole_2010 AND WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS HE WAS ARRESTED
ChristopherPoole_2010 SITES LIKE IT ARE KIND OF GOING THE WAY OF THE DINOSAUR RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ENDANGERED BECAUSE WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS SOCIAL NETWORKING WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS PERSISTENT IDENTITY WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS
ChristopherPoole_2010 YOU KNOW A LACK OF PRIVACY REALLY WE'RE SACRIFICING A LOT OF THAT AND I THINK IN DOING SO MOVING TOWARDS THOSE THINGS WE'RE LOSING SOMETHING VALUABLE

ChristopherPoole_2010 THE COMMERCIAL PICTURE IS THAT THERE REALLY ISN'T MUCH OF ONE I GUESS THE SITE HAS ADULT CONTENT ON IT
ChristopherPoole_2010 IT'S GOT SOME VERY OBSCENE CONTENT ON IT JUST IN TERMS OF LANGUAGE ALONE AND WHEN YOU'VE GOT THAT YOU'VE PRETTY MUCH SACRIFICED ANY HOPE OF MAKING LOTS OF MONEY
