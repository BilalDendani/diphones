HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@15.94:21.22 HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF A PUPPET HORSE
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@52.88:61.31 IT
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@84.33:103.64 THE HYENA IS THE ANCESTOR OF THE HORSE BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF A PRODUCTION CALLED FAUSTUS IN AFRICA A HANDSPRING PRODUCTION FROM ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE WHERE IT HAD TO PLAY DRAUGHTS WITH HELEN OF TROY THIS PRODUCTION WAS DIRECTED BY SOUTH AFRICAN ARTIST AND THEATER DIRECTOR WILLIAM KENTRIDGE
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@103.69:106.64 SO IT NEEDED A VERY ARTICULATE FRONT PAW
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@112.16:114.56 BUT LIKE ALL PUPPETS IT HAS OTHER
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@139.69:147.64 PUPPETS ALWAYS HAVE TO TRY TO BE ALIVE IT 'S THEIR KIND OF UR STORY ONSTAGE THAT DESPERATION
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@151.52:161.33 AND IT ONLY LIVES BECAUSE YOU MAKE IT AN ACTOR STRUGGLES TO DIE ONSTAGE BUT A PUPPET HAS TO STRUGGLE TO LIVE AND IN A WAY THAT 'S A METAPHOR FOR LIFE
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@169.68:176.76 EMOTIONAL ENGINEERING THAT USES UP TO THE MINUTE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY TECHNOLOGY
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@188.79:199.54 WITH MOVEMENT BUILT INTO IT TO PERSUADE YOU TO BELIEVE THAT IT HAS LIFE BJ OKAY SO AK IT HAS EARS THAT MOVE PASSIVELY WHEN THE HEAD GOES
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@206.79:215.99 CURIOUSLY SIMILAR IN FACT TO THE PLYWOOD CANOES THAT ADRIAN 'S FATHER USED TO MAKE WHEN HE WAS A BOY IN THEIR WORKSHOP
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@263.75:272.96 COLLABORATED WITH A COMPANY FROM MALI THE SOGOLON MARIONETTE TROUPE OF BAMAKO WHERE WE MADE A PIECE ABOUT A TALL GIRAFFE IT WAS JUST CALLED TALL HORSE WHICH WAS A LIFE SIZED GIRAFFE
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@323.01:325.11 AND HE JOINS UP TO FIND HIS HORSE
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@404.96:422.03 AND THE PROTOTYPE TOOK A BIT LONGER THAN WE ANTICIPATED WE HAD TO THROW OUT THE PLYWOOD LEGS AND MAKE NEW CANE ONES AND WE HAD A CRATE BUILT FOR IT IT HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO LONDON WE WERE GOING TO TEST DRIVE IT ON THE STREET OUTSIDE OF OUR HOUSE IN CAPE TOWN AND IT GOT TO MIDNIGHT AND WE HADN 'T DONE THAT YET
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@424.04:440.89 AND WE POSED THE PUPPET IN VARIOUS GALLOPING STANCES AND WE SENT IT OFF TO THE NATIONAL THEATRE HOPING THAT THEY BELIEVED THAT WE CREATED SOMETHING THAT WORKED
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@462.25:469.63 OF THE PROTOTYPE THIS IS IN THE NATIONAL THEATRE STUDIO THE PLACE WHERE THEY COOK NEW IDEAS IT HAD BY NO MEANS GOT THE GREEN LIGHT
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@485.52:501.59 GREW UP INTO THE BIG HORSE AND NICK STARR THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL THEATRE SAW THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT HE WAS STANDING NEXT TO ME HE NEARLY WET HIMSELF AND SO THE SHOW WAS GIVEN THE GREEN LIGHT AND WE WENT BACK TO CAPE TOWN AND REDESIGNED THE HORSE COMPLETELY HERE IS THE PLAN
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@510.69:514.44 YOU CAN SEE QUITE A LOT OF SKELETONS IN THE BACKGROUND THERE
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@532.3:542.86 SO HERE ARE SOME HALF FINISHED HORSES READY TO BE WORKED IN LONDON AND NOW WE WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO JOEY

HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@655.41:657.55 HERE CRAIG IS WORKING THE HEAD
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@658.18:675.54 HE HAS BICYCLE BRAKE CABLES GOING DOWN TO THE HEAD CONTROL IN HIS HAND EACH ONE OF THEM OPERATES EITHER AN EAR SEPARATELY OR THE HEAD UP AND DOWN BUT HE ALSO CONTROLS THE HEAD DIRECTLY BY USING HIS HAND
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@687.95:696.42 DEPENDING UPON WHAT 'S GOING ON IN FRONT OF HIM AROUND HIM OR WHEN HE 'S MORE RELAXED THE HEAD COMES DOWN AND THE EARS LISTEN EITHER SIDE
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@697.8:701.86 HORSES HEARING IS VERY IMPORTANT IT 'S ALMOST MORE IMPORTANT THAN THEIR EYESIGHT
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@703.48:719.82 OVER HERE TOMMY 'S GOT WHAT YOU CALL THE HEART POSITION HE 'S WORKING THE LEG YOU SEE THE STRING TENDON FROM THE HYENA THE HYENA 'S FRONT LEG AUTOMATICALLY PULLS THE HOOP UP
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@750.5:757.41 FROM LEFT TO RIGHT AND UP AND DOWN WITH THE OTHER HAND AND TOGETHER THERE 'S QUITE A COMPLEX POSSIBILITY
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@764.68:778.9 THOUGHT THAT HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO SPLIT THE CHEST OF THE PUPPET IN TWO AND MAKE IT BREATHE LIKE THAT BECAUSE THAT 'S HOW A HORSE WOULD BREATHE WITH AN EXPANDED CHEST BUT WE REALIZED THAT IF THAT WERE TO BE HAPPENING YOU WOULDN 'T AS AN AUDIENCE SEE THE BREATH
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@778.9:781.15 SO HE MADE A CHANNEL IN HERE

HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@823.08:836.65 BUT OF COURSE IT WAS THE CANE IS LIGHT THE CANE IS FLEXIBLE THE CANE IS DURABLE AND THE CANE IS MOLDABLE AND SO IT WAS A VERY PRACTICAL REASON WHY IT WAS MADE OF CANE THE SKIN ITSELF IS MADE OUT OF A SEE THROUGH NYLON MESH WHICH
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@836.65:843.51 IF THE LIGHTING DESIGNER WANTS THE HORSE TO ALMOST DISAPPEAR SHE CAN LIGHT THE BACKGROUND AND THE HORSE
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@845.73:851.38 THE SKELETAL STRUCTURE OF IT OR IF YOU LIGHT IT FROM ABOVE IT BECOMES MORE SOLID AGAIN THAT WAS A
HandspringPuppetCompany_2011@851.38:867.33 PRACTICAL CONSIDERATION THE GUYS INSIDE THE HORSE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE OUT THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ACT ALONG WITH THEIR FELLOW ACTORS IN THE PRODUCTION AND IT 'S VERY MUCH AN IN THE MOMENT ACTIVITY THAT THEY 'RE ENGAGED IN IT 'S THREE HEADS MAKING ONE CHARACTER
