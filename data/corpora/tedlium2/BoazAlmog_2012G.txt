BoazAlmog_2012G@42.36:47.02 SUPERCONDUCTIVITY IS A QUANTUM STATE OF MATTER
BoazAlmog_2012G@60.32:68.45 WE ARE NOW ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO YOU QUANTUM LEVITATION AND QUANTUM LOCKING SO
BoazAlmog_2012G@68.47:79.62 A SUPERCONDUCTOR IS DEFINED BY TWO PROPERTIES THE FIRST IS ZERO ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE AND THE SECOND IS THE EXPULSION OF A MAGNETIC FIELD
BoazAlmog_2012G@79.73:82.72 FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE SUPERCONDUCTOR
BoazAlmog_2012G@82.72:90.04 THAT SOUNDS COMPLICATED RIGHT BUT WHAT IS ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE SO
BoazAlmog_2012G@103.4:110.73 AND THEY DISSIPATE THIS ENERGY IN THE FORM OF HEAT AND YOU KNOW THAT EFFECT HOWEVER
BoazAlmog_2012G@110.96:112.88 INSIDE A SUPERCONDUCTOR
BoazAlmog_2012G@112.97:120.99 THERE ARE NO COLLISIONS SO THERE IS NO ENERGY DISSIPATION IT 'S QUITE REMARKABLE
BoazAlmog_2012G@121.04:133.68 THINK ABOUT IT IN CLASSICAL PHYSICS THERE IS ALWAYS SOME FRICTION SOME ENERGY LOSS BUT NOT HERE BECAUSE IT IS A QUANTUM EFFECT BUT THAT 'S NOT ALL BECAUSE
BoazAlmog_2012G@165.22:172.77 PERFECT AS WE ALL KNOW AND SOMETIMES STRANDS OF MAGNETIC FIELD REMAIN INSIDE THE SUPERCONDUCTOR
BoazAlmog_2012G@172.77:174.53 NOW
BoazAlmog_2012G@175.02:180.74 UNDER PROPER CONDITIONS WHICH WE HAVE HERE THESE STRANDS OF MAGNETIC FIELD CAN BE TRAPPED
BoazAlmog_2012G@180.84:184.74 INSIDE THE SUPERCONDUCTOR
BoazAlmog_2012G@187.45:189.4 INSIDE THE SUPERCONDUCTOR
BoazAlmog_2012G@207.82:210.77 THESE ARE NOT PARTICLES BUT THEY BEHAVE LIKE PARTICLES
BoazAlmog_2012G@220.32:222.22 WHEN WE PUT IT INSIDE
BoazAlmog_2012G@234.21:239.36 DISSIPATE ENERGY WHICH BREAKS THE SUPERCONDUCTIVITY STATE
BoazAlmog_2012G@239.36:251.44 SO WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES IT LOCKS THESE STRANDS WHICH ARE CALLED FLUXONS AND IT LOCKS THESE FLUXONS IN PLACE AND BY DOING THAT WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES
BoazAlmog_2012G@252.41:257.19 IS LOCKING ITSELF IN PLACE WHY BECAUSE
BoazAlmog_2012G@257.44:260.47 ANY MOVEMENT
BoazAlmog_2012G@260.47:269.3 OF THE SUPERCONDUCTOR WILL CHANGE THEIR PLACE WILL CHANGE THEIR CONFIGURATION SO WE GET QUANTUM LOCKING AND LET ME SHOW YOU
BoazAlmog_2012G@269.75:277.36 HOW THIS WORKS I HAVE HERE A SUPERCONDUCTOR WHICH I WRAPPED UP SO IT 'D STAY COLD LONG ENOUGH
BoazAlmog_2012G@277.36:279.92 AND WHEN I PLACE IT ON
BoazAlmog_2012G@296.13:298.69 AND IT WILL BE LOCKED IN THIS NEW CONFIGURATION
BoazAlmog_2012G@299.18:304.18 LIKE THIS OR MOVE IT SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT SO
BoazAlmog_2012G@304.31:306.5 THIS IS QUANTUM LOCKING
BoazAlmog_2012G@328.7:334.82 YOU WON 'T BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT IF I TAKE THIS CIRCULAR MAGNET
BoazAlmog_2012G@334.82:337.44 IN WHICH THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS THE SAME ALL AROUND
BoazAlmog_2012G@337.52:345.54 THE SUPERCONDUCTOR WILL BE ABLE TO FREELY ROTATE AROUND THE AXIS OF THE MAGNET WHY BECAUSE AS LONG AS IT ROTATES
BoazAlmog_2012G@345.54:351.44 THE LOCKING IS MAINTAINED YOU SEE I CAN ADJUST
BoazAlmog_2012G@351.77:355.57 AND I CAN ROTATE THE SUPERCONDUCTOR WE HAVE
BoazAlmog_2012G@355.68:362.41 FRICTIONLESS MOTION IT IS STILL LEVITATING BUT CAN MOVE FREELY ALL AROUND
BoazAlmog_2012G@362.41:365.06 SO
BoazAlmog_2012G@365.39:371.28 WE HAVE QUANTUM LOCKING AND WE CAN LEVITATE IT ON TOP OF THIS MAGNET
BoazAlmog_2012G@385.65:392.9 THREE INCH DISK BUT THAT 'S NOT THE AMAZING PART YET BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING I HAVEN 'T TOLD YOU YET
BoazAlmog_2012G@394.15:397.87 AND YEAH THE AMAZING PART IS THAT THIS SUPERCONDUCTOR THAT YOU SEE HERE
BoazAlmog_2012G@421.65:430.18 I CAN EXTEND THIS CIRCULAR MAGNET AND MAKE WHATEVER TRACK I WANT FOR EXAMPLE I CAN MAKE
BoazAlmog_2012G@433.1:444.12 AND WHEN I PLACE THE SUPERCONDUCTING DISK ON TOP OF THIS RAIL IT MOVES FREELY
BoazAlmog_2012G@452.5:458.11 AND AGAIN THAT 'S NOT ALL I CAN ADJUST ITS POSITION LIKE THIS AND ROTATE AND IT
BoazAlmog_2012G@459:463.69 FREELY MOVES IN THIS NEW POSITION
BoazAlmog_2012G@474.73:479.07 WHILE IT STAYS HERE DON 'T MOVE I WILL TRY TO
BoazAlmog_2012G@484.2:489.71 HOPEFULLY IF I DID IT CORRECTLY IT STAYS SUSPENDED
BoazAlmog_2012G@498.03:502.85 YOU SEE IT 'S QUANTUM LOCKING NOT LEVITATION
BoazAlmog_2012G@509.2:513.52 LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SUPERCONDUCTORS NOW
BoazAlmog_2012G@518.14:526.62 SO WE NOW KNOW THAT WE ARE ABLE TO TRANSFER ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF CURRENTS INSIDE SUPERCONDUCTORS SO WE CAN USE THEM
BoazAlmog_2012G@526.62:535.55 TO PRODUCE STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS SUCH AS NEEDED IN MRI MACHINES PARTICLE ACCELERATORS AND SO ON
BoazAlmog_2012G@536.06:547.67 BUT WE CAN ALSO STORE ENERGY USING SUPERCONDUCTORS BECAUSE WE HAVE NO DISSIPATION AND WE COULD ALSO PRODUCE POWER CABLES TO TRANSFER ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF
BoazAlmog_2012G@564.58:572.1 LET ME ANSWER THIS SIMPLE QUESTION BY GIVING YOU AN EXAMPLE IMAGINE YOU WOULD HAVE
BoazAlmog_2012G@572.11:585.84 A DISK SIMILAR TO THE ONE I HAVE HERE IN MY HAND THREE INCH DIAMETER WITH A SINGLE DIFFERENCE THE SUPERCONDUCTING LAYER INSTEAD OF BEING HALF A MICRON THIN
BoazAlmog_2012G@586.04:592.03 BEING TWO MILLIMETERS THIN QUITE THIN THIS TWO MILLIMETER THIN SUPERCONDUCTING LAYER
BoazAlmog_2012G@597.8:602.49 IN MY HAND AMAZING THANK YOU
