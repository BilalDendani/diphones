BoazAlmog_2012G SUPERCONDUCTIVITY IS A QUANTUM STATE OF MATTER
BoazAlmog_2012G WE ARE NOW ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO YOU QUANTUM LEVITATION AND QUANTUM LOCKING SO
BoazAlmog_2012G A SUPERCONDUCTOR IS DEFINED BY TWO PROPERTIES THE FIRST IS ZERO ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE AND THE SECOND IS THE EXPULSION OF A MAGNETIC FIELD
BoazAlmog_2012G FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE SUPERCONDUCTOR
BoazAlmog_2012G THAT SOUNDS COMPLICATED RIGHT BUT WHAT IS ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE SO
BoazAlmog_2012G AND THEY DISSIPATE THIS ENERGY IN THE FORM OF HEAT AND YOU KNOW THAT EFFECT HOWEVER
BoazAlmog_2012G INSIDE A SUPERCONDUCTOR
BoazAlmog_2012G THERE ARE NO COLLISIONS SO THERE IS NO ENERGY DISSIPATION IT 'S QUITE REMARKABLE
BoazAlmog_2012G THINK ABOUT IT IN CLASSICAL PHYSICS THERE IS ALWAYS SOME FRICTION SOME ENERGY LOSS BUT NOT HERE BECAUSE IT IS A QUANTUM EFFECT BUT THAT 'S NOT ALL BECAUSE
BoazAlmog_2012G PERFECT AS WE ALL KNOW AND SOMETIMES STRANDS OF MAGNETIC FIELD REMAIN INSIDE THE SUPERCONDUCTOR
BoazAlmog_2012G NOW
BoazAlmog_2012G UNDER PROPER CONDITIONS WHICH WE HAVE HERE THESE STRANDS OF MAGNETIC FIELD CAN BE TRAPPED
BoazAlmog_2012G INSIDE THE SUPERCONDUCTOR
BoazAlmog_2012G INSIDE THE SUPERCONDUCTOR
BoazAlmog_2012G THESE ARE NOT PARTICLES BUT THEY BEHAVE LIKE PARTICLES
BoazAlmog_2012G WHEN WE PUT IT INSIDE
BoazAlmog_2012G DISSIPATE ENERGY WHICH BREAKS THE SUPERCONDUCTIVITY STATE
BoazAlmog_2012G SO WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES IT LOCKS THESE STRANDS WHICH ARE CALLED FLUXONS AND IT LOCKS THESE FLUXONS IN PLACE AND BY DOING THAT WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES
BoazAlmog_2012G IS LOCKING ITSELF IN PLACE WHY BECAUSE
BoazAlmog_2012G ANY MOVEMENT
BoazAlmog_2012G OF THE SUPERCONDUCTOR WILL CHANGE THEIR PLACE WILL CHANGE THEIR CONFIGURATION SO WE GET QUANTUM LOCKING AND LET ME SHOW YOU
BoazAlmog_2012G HOW THIS WORKS I HAVE HERE A SUPERCONDUCTOR WHICH I WRAPPED UP SO IT 'D STAY COLD LONG ENOUGH
BoazAlmog_2012G AND WHEN I PLACE IT ON
BoazAlmog_2012G AND IT WILL BE LOCKED IN THIS NEW CONFIGURATION
BoazAlmog_2012G LIKE THIS OR MOVE IT SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT SO
BoazAlmog_2012G THIS IS QUANTUM LOCKING
BoazAlmog_2012G YOU WON 'T BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT IF I TAKE THIS CIRCULAR MAGNET
BoazAlmog_2012G IN WHICH THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS THE SAME ALL AROUND
BoazAlmog_2012G THE SUPERCONDUCTOR WILL BE ABLE TO FREELY ROTATE AROUND THE AXIS OF THE MAGNET WHY BECAUSE AS LONG AS IT ROTATES
BoazAlmog_2012G THE LOCKING IS MAINTAINED YOU SEE I CAN ADJUST
BoazAlmog_2012G AND I CAN ROTATE THE SUPERCONDUCTOR WE HAVE
BoazAlmog_2012G FRICTIONLESS MOTION IT IS STILL LEVITATING BUT CAN MOVE FREELY ALL AROUND
BoazAlmog_2012G SO
BoazAlmog_2012G WE HAVE QUANTUM LOCKING AND WE CAN LEVITATE IT ON TOP OF THIS MAGNET
BoazAlmog_2012G THREE INCH DISK BUT THAT 'S NOT THE AMAZING PART YET BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING I HAVEN 'T TOLD YOU YET
BoazAlmog_2012G AND YEAH THE AMAZING PART IS THAT THIS SUPERCONDUCTOR THAT YOU SEE HERE
BoazAlmog_2012G I CAN EXTEND THIS CIRCULAR MAGNET AND MAKE WHATEVER TRACK I WANT FOR EXAMPLE I CAN MAKE
BoazAlmog_2012G AND WHEN I PLACE THE SUPERCONDUCTING DISK ON TOP OF THIS RAIL IT MOVES FREELY
BoazAlmog_2012G AND AGAIN THAT 'S NOT ALL I CAN ADJUST ITS POSITION LIKE THIS AND ROTATE AND IT
BoazAlmog_2012G FREELY MOVES IN THIS NEW POSITION
BoazAlmog_2012G WHILE IT STAYS HERE DON 'T MOVE I WILL TRY TO
BoazAlmog_2012G HOPEFULLY IF I DID IT CORRECTLY IT STAYS SUSPENDED
BoazAlmog_2012G YOU SEE IT 'S QUANTUM LOCKING NOT LEVITATION
BoazAlmog_2012G LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SUPERCONDUCTORS NOW
BoazAlmog_2012G SO WE NOW KNOW THAT WE ARE ABLE TO TRANSFER ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF CURRENTS INSIDE SUPERCONDUCTORS SO WE CAN USE THEM
BoazAlmog_2012G TO PRODUCE STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS SUCH AS NEEDED IN MRI MACHINES PARTICLE ACCELERATORS AND SO ON
BoazAlmog_2012G BUT WE CAN ALSO STORE ENERGY USING SUPERCONDUCTORS BECAUSE WE HAVE NO DISSIPATION AND WE COULD ALSO PRODUCE POWER CABLES TO TRANSFER ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF
BoazAlmog_2012G LET ME ANSWER THIS SIMPLE QUESTION BY GIVING YOU AN EXAMPLE IMAGINE YOU WOULD HAVE
BoazAlmog_2012G A DISK SIMILAR TO THE ONE I HAVE HERE IN MY HAND THREE INCH DIAMETER WITH A SINGLE DIFFERENCE THE SUPERCONDUCTING LAYER INSTEAD OF BEING HALF A MICRON THIN
BoazAlmog_2012G BEING TWO MILLIMETERS THIN QUITE THIN THIS TWO MILLIMETER THIN SUPERCONDUCTING LAYER
BoazAlmog_2012G IN MY HAND AMAZING THANK YOU
