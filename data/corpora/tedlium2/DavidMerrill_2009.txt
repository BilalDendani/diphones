DavidMerrill_2009@11.48:25.62 I WANT TO START OUT BY ASKING YOU TO THINK BACK TO WHEN YOU WERE A KID PLAYING WITH BLOCKS AS YOU FIGURED OUT HOW TO REACH OUT AND GRASP PICK THEM UP AND MOVE THEM AROUND YOU WERE ACTUALLY LEARNING HOW TO THINK AND SOLVE PROBLEMS BY UNDERSTANDING AND MANIPULATING SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS
DavidMerrill_2009@25.62:31.81 SPATIAL REASONING IS DEEPLY CONNECTED TO HOW WE UNDERSTAND A LOT OF THE WORLD AROUND US SO
DavidMerrill_2009@31.81:41.11 AS A COMPUTER SCIENTIST INSPIRED BY THIS UTILITY OF OUR INTERACTIONS WITH PHYSICAL OBJECTS ALONG WITH MY ADVISER PATTIE AND MY COLLABORATOR JEEVAN KALANITHI I STARTED TO WONDER
DavidMerrill_2009@41.11:53.61 WHAT IF WHEN WE USED A COMPUTER INSTEAD OF HAVING THIS ONE MOUSE CURSOR THAT WAS A LIKE A DIGITAL FINGERTIP MOVING AROUND A FLAT DESKTOP WHAT IF WE COULD REACH IN WITH BOTH HANDS AND GRASP INFORMATION PHYSICALLY ARRANGING IT THE WAY WE WANTED
DavidMerrill_2009@53.61:58.99 THIS QUESTION WAS SO COMPELLING THAT WE DECIDED TO EXPLORE THE ANSWER BY BUILDING SIFTABLES
DavidMerrill_2009@58.99:70.51 IN A NUTSHELL A SIFTABLE IS AN INTERACTIVE COMPUTER THE SIZE OF A COOKIE THEY 'RE ABLE TO BE MOVED AROUND BY HAND THEY CAN SENSE EACH OTHER THEY CAN SENSE THEIR MOTION AND THEY HAVE A SCREEN AND A WIRELESS RADIO
DavidMerrill_2009@70.51:81.51 MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY 'RE PHYSICAL SO LIKE THE BLOCKS YOU CAN MOVE THEM JUST BY REACHING OUT AND GRASPING AND SIFTABLES ARE AN EXAMPLE OF A NEW ECOSYSTEM OF TOOLS FOR MANIPULATING DIGITAL INFORMATION
DavidMerrill_2009@81.51:99.81 AND AS THESE TOOLS BECOME MORE PHYSICAL MORE AWARE OF THEIR MOTION AWARE OF EACH OTHER AND AWARE OF THE NUANCE OF HOW WE MOVE THEM WE CAN START TO EXPLORE SOME NEW AND FUN INTERACTION STYLES SO I 'M GOING TO START WITH SOME SIMPLE EXAMPLES THIS SIFTABLE IS CONFIGURED TO SHOW VIDEO AND IF I TILT IT IN ONE DIRECTION IT 'LL ROLL THE VIDEO THIS WAY IF I TILT IT THE OTHER WAY
DavidMerrill_2009@99.81:107.29 IT ROLLS IT BACKWARDS AND THESE INTERACTIVE PORTRAITS ARE AWARE OF EACH OTHER SO IF I PUT THEM NEXT TO EACH OTHER THEY GET INTERESTED
DavidMerrill_2009@107.29:116.59 IF THEY GET SURROUNDED THEY NOTICE THAT TOO THEY MIGHT GET A LITTLE FLUSTERED AND THEY CAN ALSO SENSE THEIR MOTION AND TILT
DavidMerrill_2009@116.59:124.24 SO ONE OF THE INTERESTING IMPLICATIONS ON INTERACTION WE STARTED TO REALIZE WAS THAT WE COULD USE EVERYDAY GESTURES ON DATA
DavidMerrill_2009@124.24:137.32 LIKE POURING A COLOR THE WAY WE MIGHT POUR A LIQUID SO IN THIS CASE WE 'VE GOT THREE SIFTABLES CONFIGURED TO BE PAINT BUCKETS AND I CAN USE THEM TO POUR COLOR INTO THAT CENTRAL ONE WHERE THEY GET MIXED IF WE OVERSHOOT WE CAN POUR A LITTLE BIT BACK
DavidMerrill_2009@137.32:139.53 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@139.53:150.53 THERE ARE ALSO SOME NEAT POSSIBILITIES FOR EDUCATION LIKE LANGUAGE MATH AND LOGIC GAMES WHERE WE WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO TRY THINGS QUICKLY AND VIEW THE RESULTS IMMEDIATELY SO HERE I 'M
DavidMerrill_2009@150.53:153.22 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@153.22:165.98 THIS IS A FIBONACCI SEQUENCE THAT I 'M MAKING WITH A SIMPLE EQUATION PROGRAM HERE WE HAVE A WORD GAME THAT 'S KIND OF LIKE A MASH UP BETWEEN SCRABBLE AND BOGGLE BASICALLY IN EVERY ROUND YOU GET A RANDOMLY ASSIGNED LETTER ON EACH SIFTABLE
DavidMerrill_2009@165.98:174.40 AND AS YOU TRY TO MAKE WORDS IT CHECKS AGAINST A DICTIONARY THEN AFTER ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS IT RESHUFFLES AND YOU HAVE A NEW SET OF LETTERS AND NEW POSSIBILITIES TO TRY

DavidMerrill_2009@176.32:177.21 THANK YOU
DavidMerrill_2009@177.21:178.65 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@178.65:185.76 SO THESE ARE SOME KIDS THAT CAME ON A FIELD TRIP TO THE MEDIA LAB AND I MANAGED TO GET THEM TO TRY IT OUT AND SHOOT A VIDEO
DavidMerrill_2009@185.76:191.93 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@191.93:201.85 THEY REALLY LOVED IT AND ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THIS KIND OF APPLICATION IS THAT YOU DON 'T HAVE TO GIVE PEOPLE MANY INSTRUCTIONS ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY IS MAKE WORDS AND THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO
DavidMerrill_2009@201.85:202.49 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@202.49:204.87 SO HERE 'S ANOTHER FEW PEOPLE TRYING IT OUT
DavidMerrill_2009@204.87:212.16 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@212.16:215.63 THAT 'S OUR YOUNGEST BETA TESTER DOWN THERE ON THE RIGHT
DavidMerrill_2009@215.63:217.01 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@217.01:225.65 TURNS OUT ALL HE WANTED TO DO WAS TO STACK THE SIFTABLES UP SO TO HIM THEY WERE JUST BLOCKS
DavidMerrill_2009@225.65:237.16 NOW THIS IS AN INTERACTIVE CARTOON APPLICATION AND WE WANTED TO BUILD A LEARNING TOOL FOR LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND THIS IS FELIX ACTUALLY
DavidMerrill_2009@237.16:246.46 AND HE CAN BRING NEW CHARACTERS INTO THE SCENE JUST BY LIFTING THE SIFTABLES OFF THE TABLE THAT HAVE THAT CHARACTER SHOWN ON THEM HERE HE 'S BRINGING THE SUN OUT
DavidMerrill_2009@246.46:248.67 THE SUN IS RISING
DavidMerrill_2009@248.67:249.81 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@249.81:251.59 NOW HE 'S BROUGHT A TRACTOR INTO THE SCENE
DavidMerrill_2009@251.59:254.17 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@254.17:255.71 THE ORANGE TRACTOR
DavidMerrill_2009@255.90:258.76 GOOD JOB YEAH
DavidMerrill_2009@258.76:263.58 SO BY SHAKING THE SIFTABLES AND PUTTING THEM NEXT TO EACH OTHER HE CAN MAKE THE CHARACTERS INTERACT
DavidMerrill_2009@263.58:264.27 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@264.27:265.73 INVENTING HIS OWN NARRATIVE
DavidMerrill_2009@265.73:267.82 HELLO
DavidMerrill_2009@267.82:271.50 IT 'S AN OPEN ENDED STORY AND HE GETS TO DECIDE HOW IT UNFOLDS
DavidMerrill_2009@271.50:275.92 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@275.92:277.21 FLY AWAY CAT
DavidMerrill_2009@277.21:281.65 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@281.65:294.64 SO THE LAST EXAMPLE I HAVE TIME TO SHOW YOU TODAY IS A MUSIC SEQUENCING AND LIVE PERFORMANCE TOOL THAT WE 'VE BUILT RECENTLY IN WHICH SIFTABLES ACT AS SOUNDS LIKE LEAD BASS AND DRUMS
DavidMerrill_2009@294.84:304.65 EACH OF THESE HAS FOUR DIFFERENT VARIATIONS YOU GET TO CHOOSE WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO USE AND YOU CAN INJECT THESE SOUNDS INTO A SEQUENCE THAT YOU CAN ASSEMBLE INTO THE PATTERN THAT YOU WANT
DavidMerrill_2009@304.65:315.72 AND YOU INJECT IT BY JUST BUMPING UP THE SOUND SIFTABLE AGAINST A SEQUENCE SIFTABLE THERE ARE EFFECTS THAT YOU CAN CONTROL LIVE LIKE REVERB AND FILTER YOU ATTACH IT TO A PARTICULAR SOUND AND THEN TILT TO ADJUST IT
DavidMerrill_2009@315.73:322.60 AND THEN OVERALL EFFECTS LIKE TEMPO AND VOLUME THAT APPLY TO THE ENTIRE SEQUENCE SO LET 'S HAVE A LOOK
DavidMerrill_2009@322.60:324.76 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@324.76:327.12 WE 'LL START BY PUTTING A LEAD
DavidMerrill_2009@327.12:331.81 INTO TWO SEQUENCE SIFTABLES ARRANGE THEM INTO A SERIES
DavidMerrill_2009@331.81:336.83 EXTEND IT ADD A LITTLE MORE LEAD NOW I PUT A BASSLINE IN
DavidMerrill_2009@336.83:342.06 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@342.06:343.99 NOW I 'LL PUT SOME PERCUSSION IN
DavidMerrill_2009@343.99:348.65 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@348.65:352.49 AND NOW I 'LL ATTACH THE FILTER TO THE DRUMS SO I CAN CONTROL THE EFFECT LIVE
DavidMerrill_2009@352.49:354.19 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@354.19:360.06 I CAN SPEED UP THE WHOLE SEQUENCE BY TILTING THE TEMPO TO ONE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
DavidMerrill_2009@360.06:363.77 AND NOW I 'LL ATTACH THE FILTER TO THE BASS FOR SOME MORE EXPRESSION
DavidMerrill_2009@363.77:368.67 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@368.67:376.17 I CAN REARRANGE THE SEQUENCE WHILE IT PLAYS I DON 'T HAVE TO PLAN IT OUT IN ADVANCE BUT I CAN IMPROVISE CHANGING IT MAKING IT LONGER OR SHORTER AS I GO
DavidMerrill_2009@376.17:382.22 AND NOW FINALLY I CAN FADE THE WHOLE SEQUENCE OUT USING THE VOLUME SIFTABLE TILTED TO THE LEFT
DavidMerrill_2009@382.22:388.12 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@388.12:389.87 THANK YOU SO
DavidMerrill_2009@389.87:390.99 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DavidMerrill_2009@390.99:401.08 AS YOU CAN SEE MY PASSION IS FOR MAKING NEW HUMAN COMPUTER INTERFACES THAT ARE A BETTER MATCH TO THE WAY OUR BRAINS AND BODIES WORK AND TODAY I HAD TIME TO SHOW YOU
DavidMerrill_2009@401.08:406.50 ONE POINT IN THIS NEW DESIGN SPACE AND A FEW OF THE POSSIBILITIES THAT WE 'RE WORKING TO BRING OUT OF THE LABORATORY
DavidMerrill_2009@406.50:420.82 SO THE THOUGHT I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS THAT WE 'RE ON THE CUSP OF THIS NEW GENERATION OF TOOLS FOR INTERACTING WITH DIGITAL MEDIA THAT ARE GOING TO BRING INFORMATION INTO OUR WORLD ON OUR TERMS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING WITH ALL OF YOU
