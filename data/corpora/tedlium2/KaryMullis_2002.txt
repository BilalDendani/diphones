KaryMullis_2002 AND WHEN SURFERS ARE OUT WAITING FOR WAVES YOU PROBABLY WONDER IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN OUT THERE WHAT ARE THEY DOING YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THERE'S A TEN FIFTEEN MINUTE BREAK OUT THERE WHEN YOU'RE WAITING FOR A WAVE TO COME IN THEY USUALLY TALK ABOUT THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
KaryMullis_2002 THE WORLD PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE SORT OF LOWBROWS
KaryMullis_2002 ONE DAY SOMEBODY SUGGESTED I READ THIS BOOK IT WAS CALLED IT WAS CALLED THE AIR PUMP OR SOMETHING LIKE THE LEVIATHAN AND THE AIR PUMP IT WAS A REAL WEIRD BOOK ABOUT THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
KaryMullis_2002 THE ROOTS OF THE WAY I SORT OF THOUGHT WAS JUST THE ONLY NATURAL WAY TO THINK ABOUT THINGS
KaryMullis_2002 THAT YOU KNOW I WAS BORN THINKING ABOUT THINGS THAT WAY AND I HAD ALWAYS BEEN LIKE A LITTLE SCIENTIST GUY AND WHEN I WENT TO FIND OUT SOMETHING I USED SCIENTIFIC METHODS I WASN'T REAL SURPRISED
KaryMullis_2002 YOU KNOW WHEN THEY FIRST TOLD ME HOW HOW YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO SCIENCE BECAUSE I'D ALREADY BEEN DOING IT FOR FUN AND WHATEVER BUT
KaryMullis_2002 IT DIDN'T IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT HAD TO BE INVENTED AND THAT IT HAD BEEN INVENTED ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO
KaryMullis_2002 YOU KNOW IT WAS LIKE IT HAPPENED IN ENGLAND AND GERMANY AND ITALY SORT OF ALL AT THE SAME TIME AND
KaryMullis_2002 THE STORY OF THAT I THOUGHT WAS REALLY FASCINATING SO I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AND WHAT EXACTLY IS IT THAT SCIENTISTS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO AND
KaryMullis_2002 IT 'S IT'S A KIND OF YOU KNOW CHARLES I GOT BEHEADED SOMEWHERE EARLY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND THE ENGLISH SET UP CROMWELL AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF REPUBLICANS OR WHATEVER AND NOT THE KIND OF REPUBLICANS WE HAD THEY
KaryMullis_2002 THE GOVERNMENT AND IT DIDN'T WORK AND CHARLES II THE
KaryMullis_2002 FINALLY PUT BACK ON THE THRONE OF ENGLAND HE WAS REALLY NERVOUS BECAUSE HIS DAD HAD BEEN YOU KNOW BEHEADED FOR BEING THE KING OF ENGLAND AND HE WAS NERVOUS ABOUT THE FACT
KaryMullis_2002 THAT CONVERSATIONS THAT GOT GOING IN LIKE BARS AND STUFF WOULD TURN TO THIS IS KIND OF IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE BUT PEOPLE IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY IN ENGLAND
KaryMullis_2002 TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW PHILOSOPHY AND STUFF IN BARS THEY DIDN'T HAVE TV SCREENS AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY FOOTBALL GAMES TO WATCH
KaryMullis_2002 IT WAS OKAY IF ROBERT BOYLE MADE A DEVICE CALLED THE VACUUM PUMP NOW BOYLE WAS A FRIEND OF CHARLES II HE WAS A CHRISTIAN GUY DURING THE WEEKENDS BUT DURING THE WEEK HE WAS A SCIENTIST
KaryMullis_2002 WHICH WAS BACK THEN IT WAS SORT OF YOU KNOW WELL YOU KNOW IF YOU MADE THIS THING HE MADE THIS LITTLE DEVICE LIKE KIND OF LIKE A BICYCLE PUMP
KaryMullis_2002 IN REVERSE THAT COULD SUCK ALL THE AIR OUT OF YOU KNOW WHAT A BELL JAR IS ONE OF THESE THINGS YOU PICK IT UP PUT IT DOWN AND IT'S GOT A SEAL AND YOU CAN SEE INSIDE OF IT SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE THIS THING
KaryMullis_2002 WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO WAS TO PUMP ALL THE AIR OUT OF THERE AND SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN INSIDE THERE I MEAN THE FIRST I THINK ONE OF THE FIRST EXPERIMENTS HE DID WAS HE PUT A BIRD IN
KaryMullis_2002 AND PEOPLE IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THEY DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE SAME WAY WE DO
KaryMullis_2002 ABOUT YOU KNOW THIS STUFF IS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF MOLECULES AND WE BREATHE IT IN FOR A PURPOSE AND ALL THAT I MEAN FISH DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WATER
KaryMullis_2002 AND PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT AIR BUT BOTH STARTED EXPLORING IT ONE THING HE PUT A BIRD IN THERE AND HE PUMPED ALL THE AIR OUT AND THE BIRD DIED
KaryMullis_2002 RIGHT AND IMMEDIATELY HE GOT INTO TROUBLE WITH THE LOCAL CLERGY WHO SAID YOU CAN'T MAKE A VACUUM
KaryMullis_2002 PEOPLE RELIED ON AUTHORITIES LIKE THAT AND YOU KNOW BOYLE SAYS WELL SHIT I MAKE THEM ALL THE TIME
KaryMullis_2002 WHATEVER THAT IS THAT
KaryMullis_2002 KILLS THE BIRD AND I'M CALLING IT A VACUUM AND THE RELIGIOUS PEOPLE SAID THAT IF GOD WANTED YOU TO MAKE I MEAN GOD IS EVERYWHERE THAT WAS ONE OF THEIR RULES IS GOD IS EVERYWHERE
KaryMullis_2002 AND A VACUUM THERE'S NOTHING IN A VACUUM SO YOU'VE GOD COULDN'T BE IN THERE SO THEREFORE THE CHURCH SAID THAT YOU CAN'T MAKE A VACUUM YOU KNOW AND BOYLE SAID BULLSHIT I MEAN
KaryMullis_2002 YOU KNOW YOU CALL IT GODLESS BUT THAT'S NOT MY JOB I'M NOT INTO THAT I DO THAT ON THE WEEKEND AND
KaryMullis_2002 WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SUCK EVERYTHING OUT OF A COMPARTMENT AND HE DID ALL THESE CUTE LITTLE EXPERIMENTS LIKE HE DID ONE WITH HE HAD A LITTLE WHEEL LIKE A FAN THAT WAS
KaryMullis_2002 LOOSELY ATTACHED SO IT COULD SPIN BY ITSELF HE HAD ANOTHER FAN OPPOSED TO IT THAT HE HAD LIKE A I MEAN THE WAY I WOULD HAVE DONE THIS WOULD BE LIKE A RUBBER BAND AND YOU KNOW AROUND A TINKER TOY KIND OF
KaryMullis_2002 EXACTLY HOW HE DID IT I'VE SEEN THE DRAWINGS IT'S TWO FANS ONE WHICH HE COULD TURN FROM OUTSIDE AFTER HE GOT THE VACUUM ESTABLISHED
KaryMullis_2002 AND HE DISCOVERED THAT IF HE PULLED ALL THE AIR OUT OF IT THE ONE FAN WOULD NO LONGER TURN THE OTHER ONE RIGHT SOMETHING WAS MISSING
KaryMullis_2002 WEIRD TO THINK THAT SOMEONE HAD TO DO AN EXPERIMENT TO SHOW THAT BUT THAT WAS WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THE TIME AND LIKE THERE WAS BIG ARGUMENTS ABOUT IT IN THE YOU KNOW THE GIN HOUSES AND IN THE COFFEE SHOPS AND STUFF AND
KaryMullis_2002 WHO WANTS TO DO SCIENCE IS THIS IS ABOUT THE TIME THAT ISAAC NEWTON WAS STARTING TO WHIP OUT A LOT OF REALLY INTERESTING THINGS AND THERE WAS ALL KIND OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD COME TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY THEY CALLED IT
KaryMullis_2002 YOU HAD TO BE DRESSED UP PRETTY WELL IT WASN'T LIKE A TED CONFERENCE THE WAS THE ONLY CRITERIA WAS THAT YOU BE YOU LOOKED LIKE A GENTLEMAN AND THEY'D LET ANYBODY COULD COME YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE A MEMBER THEN
KaryMullis_2002 AND SO THEY WOULD COME IN AND YOU WOULD DO ANYBODY THAT WAS GOING TO SHOW AN EXPERIMENT WHICH WAS KIND OF A NEW WORD AT THE TIME DEMONSTRATE SOME PRINCIPLE THEY HAD TO DO IT ON STAGE WHERE EVERYBODY COULD SEE IT
KaryMullis_2002 SO THEY WERE THE REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS WAS YOU WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT FINAL CAUSES FOR INSTANCE AND GOD WAS OUT OF THE PICTURE THE ACTUAL NATURE OF REALITY WAS NOT AT ISSUE
KaryMullis_2002 NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF ANYTHING YOU WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING THAT YOU COULDN'T DEMONSTRATE SO IF SOMEBODY COULD SEE IT YOU COULD SAY HERE 'S HOW THE MACHINE WORKS HERE 'S WHAT WE DO AND THEN HERE 'S WHAT HAPPENS
KaryMullis_2002 AND SEEING WHAT HAPPENS IT WAS OK TO GENERALIZE AND SAY I'M SURE THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN ANYTIME WE MAKE ONE OF THESE THINGS AND SO YOU CAN START MAKING UP SOME RULES YOU SAY ANYTIME YOU HAVE
KaryMullis_2002 VACUUM STATE YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT ONE WHEEL WILL NOT TURN ANOTHER ONE IF IF THE ONLY CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM IS WHATEVER WAS THERE BEFORE THE VACUUM THAT KIND OF THING
KaryMullis_2002 CANDLES CAN'T BURN IN A VACUUM THEREFORE PROBABLY SPARKLERS WOULDN'T EITHER IT'S NOT CLEAR ACTUALLY SPARKLERS WILL BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE
KaryMullis_2002 YOU CAN MAKE UP RULES BUT THEY HAVE TO RELATE ONLY TO THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE AND MOST THE DEMONSTRATIONS HAD TO DO WITH
KaryMullis_2002 IF YOU DO AN EXPERIMENT ON STAGE AND NOBODY CAN SEE IT THEY CAN JUST HEAR IT THEY WOULD PROBABLY THINK YOU WERE FREAKY I MEAN REALITY IS WHAT YOU CAN SEE
KaryMullis_2002 THAT WASN'T AN EXPLICIT RULE IN THE MEETING BUT I'M SURE THAT WAS PART OF IT YOU KNOW IF PEOPLE HEAR VOICES AND THEY CAN'T SEE AND ASSOCIATE IT WITH SOMEBODY THAT PERSON 'S PROBABLY NOT THERE BUT THE GENERAL IDEA THAT YOU COULD ONLY
KaryMullis_2002 YOU COULD ONLY REALLY TALK ABOUT THINGS IN THAT PLACE THAT HAD SOME KIND OF EXPERIMENTAL BASIS IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT THOMAS HOBBES WHO WAS A LOCAL PHILOSOPHER SAID ABOUT IT
KaryMullis_2002 YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T GOING TO TALKING FINAL CAUSES WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WAS THAT WHAT BECAME MY FIELD SCIENCE EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE
KaryMullis_2002 WAS PULLING ITSELF AWAY AND IT WAS IN A PHYSICAL WAY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IN THIS ROOM OVER HERE BUT IT WAS ALSO WHAT IT WAS AN AMAZING THING THAT HAPPENED SCIENCE HAD BEEN ALL INTERLOCKED WITH THEOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY
KaryMullis_2002 AND AND AND MATHEMATICS WHICH IS REALLY NOT SCIENCE BUT EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE HAS BEEN TIED UP WITH ALL THOSE THINGS AND
KaryMullis_2002 THE MATHEMATICS PART AND THE EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE PART WAS PULLING AWAY FROM PHILOSOPHY AND THINGS WE NEVER LOOKED BACK IT'S BEEN SO COOL
KaryMullis_2002 I MEAN IT JUST IT JUST UNTANGLED A THING THAT WAS REALLY IMPEDING TECHNOLOGY FROM BEING DEVELOPED
KaryMullis_2002 AND I MEAN EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM NOW THIS IS THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SHORT YEARS AGO REMEMBER THAT'S A SHORT TIME IT WAS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PROBABLY YEARS AGO THAT
KaryMullis_2002 THAT HAPPENED VERY A LONG TIME AGO COMPARED TO THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SHORT YEARS AGO BUT IN THAT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS
KaryMullis_2002 THE PLACE HAS JUST UNDERGONE A LOT OF CHANGES IN FACT EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM PROBABLY ESPECIALLY IF YOU PICKED UP YOUR BAG
KaryMullis_2002 IF YOU CAN THINK HOW IMPORTANT IF YOU HAVE A GPS SYSTEM AND THERE ARE NO SATELLITES IT'S NOT GOING TO BE MUCH USE BUT LIKE
KaryMullis_2002 YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY HAD A GPS SYSTEM IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY SOME KING WOULD HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER AN ARMY AND GONE TO GET IT
KaryMullis_2002 THIS KIND OF STUFF YOU KNOW ALL THIS STUFF CAME FROM THAT SEPARATION OF THIS LITTLE SORT OF THING THAT WE DO NOW I WHEN I WAS A BOY
KaryMullis_2002 WAS BORN SORT OF WITH THIS IDEA THAT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE MY OLD MAN WAS GONE A LOT AND MY MOTHER DIDN'T REALLY KNOW MUCH SCIENCE
KaryMullis_2002 BUT I THOUGHT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT STUFF YOU DO IT YOU MAKE AN EXPERIMENT YOU KNOW YOU GET YOU GET LIKE
KaryMullis_2002 WAS GOT INTO TROUBLE THE OTHER NIGHT AT DINNER BECAUSE OF THE POST MODERNISM THING AND I DIDN'T MEAN YOU KNOW WHERE IS THAT LADY
KaryMullis_2002 REALLY THINK OF THAT AS AN
KaryMullis_2002 SO MUCH AS JUST A LIVELY DISCUSSION
KaryMullis_2002 I DIDN'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY
KaryMullis_2002 I
KaryMullis_2002 I NAIVELY HAD THOUGHT UNTIL THIS SURFING EXPERIENCE STARTED ME INTO THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY I'D THOUGHT THAT'S JUST THE WAY PEOPLE THOUGHT AND EVERYBODY DID AND THEY RECOGNIZED REALITY
KaryMullis_2002 WHAT THEY COULD SEE OR TOUCH OR FEEL OR HEAR AT ANY RATE WHEN I WAS A BOY
KaryMullis_2002 I LIKE FOR INSTANCE I HAD THIS I GOT THIS LITTLE BOOK FROM FORT SILL OKLAHOMA THIS IS ABOUT THE TIME THAT GEORGE DYSON 'S DAD WAS STARTING TO BLOW NUCLEAR THINKING ABOUT BLOWING UP NUCLEAR ROCKETS AND
KaryMullis_2002 I WAS THINKING ABOUT MAKING MY OWN LITTLE ROCKETS AND I KNEW THAT FROGS LITTLE FROGS HAD ASPIRATIONS OF SPACE TRAVEL JUST LIKE
KaryMullis_2002 I I WAS LOOKING FOR A
KaryMullis_2002 A PROPULSION SYSTEM THAT WOULD LIKE MAKE A ROCKET LIKE MAYBE ABOUT FOUR FEET HIGH GO UP A COUPLE OF MILES AND I MEAN THAT WAS MY SORT OF GOAL I WANTED IT TO GO OUT OF SIGHT AND THEN I WANTED THIS LITTLE PARACHUTE TO COME BACK
KaryMullis_2002 WITH THE FROG IN IT AND
KaryMullis_2002 I I I
KaryMullis_2002 BOOK FROM FORT SILL OKLAHOMA WHERE THERE'S A MISSILE BASE THEY SEND IT OUT FOR AMATEUR ROCKETEERS AND
KaryMullis_2002 SAID IN THERE DO NOT EVER HEAT A MIXTURE OF POTASSIUM PERCHLORATE AND SUGAR
KaryMullis_2002 YOU KNOW
KaryMullis_2002 PRESIDED OVER THE BACK YARD FROM AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW WHERE SHE WOULD BE IRONING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SHE WAS USUALLY JUST SORT OF KEEPING AN EYE ON AND IF THERE WAS PUFFS OF SMOKE OUT THERE SHE'D LEAN OUT
KaryMullis_2002 NOT CARE ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT'S PROHIBITED FROM HEATING THIS SOLUTION I'M GOING TO DO IT CAREFULLY BUT I'LL DO IT IT'S LIKE ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S PROHIBITED YOU DO IT BEHIND THE
KaryMullis_2002 I WENT TO THE DRUG STORE AND I TRIED TO BUY SOME POTASSIUM PERCHLORATE AND IT WASN'T UNREASONABLE THEN FOR A KID TO WALK INTO A DRUG STORE AND BUY CHEMICALS NOWADAYS IT'S NO MA 'AM CHECK YOUR SHOES AND LIKE
KaryMullis_2002 BUT THEN IT WASN'T THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY BUT THE GUY HAD I SAID WHAT KIND OF SALTS OR POTASSIUM DO YOU HAVE YOU KNOW AND HE HAD POTASSIUM NITRATE AND I SAID THAT MIGHT DO THE SAME THING
KaryMullis_2002 I'M SURE IT'S GOT TO DO WITH
KaryMullis_2002 IT WOULDN'T BE IN THAT MANUAL AND SO I I DID SOME EXPERIMENTS YOU KNOW I STARTED OFF WITH LITTLE TINY AMOUNTS OF POTASSIUM NITRATE AND SUGAR WHICH WAS READILY AVAILABLE
KaryMullis_2002 AND I MIXED IT IN DIFFERENT PROPORTIONS AND I TRIED TO LIGHT IT ON FIRE
KaryMullis_2002 JUST TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU MIXED IT TOGETHER AND IT THEY BURNED IT BURNED KIND OF SLOW BUT IT MADE A NICE SMELL COMPARED TO OTHER ROCKET FUELS I HAD TRIED THAT ALL HAD SULFUR IN
KaryMullis_2002 AND IT SMELT LIKE BURNT CANDY AND THEN I TRIED THE MELTING BUSINESS AND I MELTED IT AND THEN IT MELTED INTO A LITTLE SORT OF SYRUPY LIQUID BROWN AND THEN IT COOLED DOWN TO A BRICK HARD SUBSTANCE
KaryMullis_2002 THERE IS A WAY TO GET A
KaryMullis_2002 SO I STARTED DEVELOPING
KaryMullis_2002 DAD HAD A LOT OF HELP I JUST HAD MY BROTHER
KaryMullis_2002 BUT I IT TOOK ME ABOUT IT TOOK ME ABOUT
KaryMullis_2002 SAY SIX MONTHS TO FINALLY FIGURE OUT ALL THE LITTLE THINGS THERE'S A LOT OF LITTLE THINGS INVOLVED IN MAKING A ROCKET THAT IT WILL ACTUALLY WORK EVEN AFTER YOU HAVE THE FUEL BUT YOU DO IT BY WHAT I JUST YOU KNOW YOU DO EXPERIMENTS
KaryMullis_2002 AND YOU WRITE DOWN THINGS SOMETIMES YOU MAKE OBSERVATIONS YOU KNOW AND THEN YOU SLOWLY BUILD UP A THEORY OF HOW THIS STUFF WORKS AND IT WAS I WAS FOLLOWING ALL THE RULES I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE RULES WERE I'M A NATURAL BORN SCIENTIST I GUESS OR
KaryMullis_2002 SOME KIND OF A THROWBACK TO THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WHATEVER BUT AT ANY RATE WE FINALLY DID HAVE A DEVICE THAT WOULD REPRODUCEABLY PUT
KaryMullis_2002 OUT OF SIGHT AND GET HIM BACK ALIVE AND WE HAD NOT I MEAN WE WEREN'T FRIGHTENED BY IT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
KaryMullis_2002 BECAUSE IT MADE A LOT OF SMOKE AND IT MADE A LOT OF NOISE AND IT WAS POWERFUL YOU KNOW AND ONCE IN A WHILE THEY WOULD BLOW UP BUT
KaryMullis_2002 I WASN'T WORRIED BY THE WAY ABOUT YOU KNOW THE EXPLOSION CAUSING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PLANET I HADN'T HEARD ABOUT THE TEN WAYS THAT WE SHOULD BE AFRAID
KaryMullis_2002 BY THE WAY I COULD HAVE THOUGHT I'D BETTER NOT DO THIS
KaryMullis_2002 BECAUSE THEY SAY NOT TO YOU KNOW AND I'D BETTER GET PERMISSIONFROM THE GOVERNMENT IF I'D HAVE WAITED AROUND FOR THAT I WOULD HAVE NEVER THE FROG WOULD HAVE DIED
KaryMullis_2002 YOU GET AN IDEA LIKE WHEN I GOT THE IDEA ONE NIGHT THAT I COULD AMPLIFY DNA WITH TWO OLIGONUCLEOTIDES AND I COULD MAKE LOTS OF COPIES OF SOME LITTLE PIECE OF DNA
KaryMullis_2002 YOU KNOW THE THINKING FOR THAT WAS ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES WHILE I WAS DRIVING MY CAR AND THEN INSTEAD OF GOING I WENT BACK AND I DID TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT IT BUT IF I'D LISTENED TO WHAT I HEARD FROM ALL MY FRIENDS WHO WERE MOLECULAR BIOLOGISTS
KaryMullis_2002 I WOULD HAVE ABANDONED IT YOU KNOW IF I HAD GONE BACK LOOKING FOR AN AUTHORITY FIGURE WHO COULD TELL ME IF IT WOULD WORK OR NOT HE WOULD HAVE SAID NO
KaryMullis_2002 PROBABLY WON 'T BECAUSE THE RESULTS OF IT WERE SO SPECTACULAR THAT IF IT WORKED IT WAS GOING TO CHANGE EVERYBODY 'S GODDAMN WAY OF DOING MOLECULAR BIOLOGY NOBODY WANT A CHEMIST TO COME IN AND POKE AROUND IN THEIR STUFF LIKE THAT AND CHANGE THINGS
KaryMullis_2002 BUT IF YOU GO TO AUTHORITY AND YOU ALWAYS DON'T YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET THE RIGHT ANSWER SEE BUT I KNEW YOU'D GO INTO THE LAB AND YOU'D TRY TO MAKE IT WORK YOURSELF AND THEN YOU'RE THE AUTHORITY AND YOU CAN SAY I KNOW IT WORKS BECAUSE RIGHT THERE IN THAT
KaryMullis_2002 TUBE IS WHERE IT HAPPENED AND HERE ON THIS GEL THERE'S A LITTLE BAND THERE THAT I KNOW THAT'S DNA AND THAT'S THE DNA I WANTED TO AMPLIFY SO THERE
KaryMullis_2002 SO IT DOES WORK YOU KNOW THAT'S HOW YOU DO SCIENCE AND THEN YOU SAY WELL WHAT CAN MAKE IT WORK BETTER AND THEN YOU FIGURE OUT BETTER AND BETTER WAYS TO DO IT BUT YOU ALWAYS WORK FROM FROM LIKE FACTS THAT YOU HAVE
KaryMullis_2002 MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU BY DOING EXPERIMENTS THINGS THAT YOU COULD DO ON A STAGE AND NO TRICKY SHIT BEHIND THE THING I MEAN IT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT TO BE VERY HONEST
KaryMullis_2002 WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING IF IT REALLY IS GOING TO WORK I MEAN YOU CAN'T MAKE UP RESULTS AND THEN DO ANOTHER EXPERIMENT BASED ON THAT ONE SO YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST
KaryMullis_2002 AND I'M BASICALLY HONEST I HAVE A FAIRLY BAD MEMORY AND DISHONESTY WOULD ALWAYS GET ME IN TROUBLE IF I LIKE SO I'VE JUST SORT OF BEEN NATURALLY HONEST AND NATURALLY INQUISITIVE AND THAT SORT OF LEADS TO THAT KIND OF SCIENCE NOW
KaryMullis_2002 ALL SCIENTISTS AREN'T LIKE THAT
KaryMullis_2002 AND THERE IS A LOT
KaryMullis_2002 THERE IS A LOT A LOT HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE ISAAC NEWTON AND ALL THAT STUFF HAPPENED ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED RIGHT AROUND WORLD WAR II IN THAT SAME TIME PERIOD BEFORE AND AS SURE AS HELL AFTERWARDS
KaryMullis_2002 TEST TUBE SCIENTISTS YOU KNOW MADE WORLD WAR II AS WE KNOW IT QUITE POSSIBLE THEY MADE FASTER THINGS THEY MADE
KaryMullis_2002 BIGGER GUNS TO SHOOT THEM DOWN WITH YOU KNOW THEY MADE DRUGS TO GIVE THE PILOTS IF THEY WERE BROKEN UP IN THE PROCESS
KaryMullis_2002 MADE ALL KINDS OF AND THEN FINALLY ONE GIANT BOMB TO END THE WHOLE THING RIGHT AND EVERYBODY STEPPED BACK A LITTLE AND SAID YOU KNOW WE OUGHT TO INVEST IN
KaryMullis_2002 BECAUSE WHOEVER HAS GOT THE MOST
KaryMullis_2002 THESE PEOPLE WORKING IN THE PLACES IS GOING TO HAVE A DOMINANT POSITION AT LEAST IN THE MILITARY AND PROBABLY IN ALL KIND OF ECONOMIC WAYS AND THEY GOT INVOLVED IN IT
KaryMullis_2002 YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT WAS SUDDENLY AVAILABLE AND THEY WEREN'T THE CURIOUS LITTLE BOYS THAT LIKED TO PUT FROGS UP IN THE AIR THEY WERE THE SAME PEOPLE THAT LATER WENT IN TO MEDICAL SCHOOL YOU KNOW BECAUSE THERE WAS MONEY IN IT YOU KNOW I MEAN LATER THEN THEY ALL GOT INTO BUSINESS I MEAN THERE ARE WAVES OF GOING
KaryMullis_2002 YOUR HIGH SCHOOL PERSON SAYING YOU WANT TO BE RIGHT YOU KNOW BE A SCIENTIST YOU KNOW NOT ANYMORE YOU WANT TO BE RICH YOU BE A BUSINESSMAN BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT IN IT FOR THE MONEY AND THE POWER AND THE TRAVEL THAT'S BACK WHEN TRAVEL WAS EASY AND
KaryMullis_2002 THOSE PEOPLE DON'T THINK THEY DON'T THEY DON'T ALWAYS TELL YOU THE TRUTH YOU KNOW THERE IS NOTHING IN THEIR CONTRACT IN FACT THAT MAKES IT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE ALWAYS TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH AND THE PEOPLE I'M TALKING ABOUT ARE PEOPLE THAT LIKE
KaryMullis_2002 THEY SAY THAT THEY'RE A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE CALLED SAY THE INTER GOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND THEY AND THEY HAVE THESE BIG MEETINGS WHERE THEY TRY TO FIGURE OUT
KaryMullis_2002 HOW WE'RE GOING TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUALLY PROVE THAT THE PLANET IS GETTING WARMER WHEN THAT'S ACTUALLY CONTRARY TO MOST PEOPLE 'S SENSATIONS I MEAN IF YOU ACTUALLY MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE
KaryMullis_2002 OVER A PERIOD I MEAN THE TEMPERATURE HAS BEEN MEASURED NOW PRETTY CAREFULLY FOR ABOUT FIFTY SIXTY YEARS LONGER THAN THAT IT'S BEEN MEASURED BUT IN REALLY NICE
KaryMullis_2002 WEATHER STATIONS HAVE COME UP JUST A LITTLE BIT BUT THERE'S A GOOD EXPLANATION FOR THAT AND IT'S THAT THE WEATHER STATIONS ARE ALL BUILT OUTSIDE OF TOWN WHERE THE AIRPORT WAS AND NOW THE TOWN 'S MOVED OUT THERE THERE'S CONCRETE ALL AROUND AND THEY CALL IT THE SKYLINE EFFECT
KaryMullis_2002 AND MOST RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE THAT MEASURE TEMPERATURES REALIZE YOU HAVE TO SHIELD YOUR MEASURING DEVICE FROM THAT AND EVEN THEN
KaryMullis_2002 YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE BUILDINGS GET WARM IN THE DAYTIME AND THEY KEEP IT A LITTLE WARMER AT NIGHT SO THE TEMPERATURE HAS BEEN SORT OF INCHING UP IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUT NOT A LOT NOT LIKE
KaryMullis_2002 YOU KNOW THE FIRST GUY THE FIRST GUY THAT GOT THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO FRY OURSELVES HERE ACTUALLY HE DIDN'T THINK OF IT THAT WAY HIS NAME WAS SVEN ARRHENIUS HE WAS SWEDISH
KaryMullis_2002 AND HE SAID IF YOU DOUBLE THE CO TWO LEVEL IN THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH HE THOUGHT MIGHT THIS IS IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED
KaryMullis_2002 THE TEMPERATURE OUGHT TO GO UP ABOUT FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREES HE CALCULATED HE WAS THINKING OF THE EARTH AS KIND OF LIKE YOU KNOW LIKE A COMPLETELY INSULATED THING WITH NO STUFF IN IT REALLY JUST ENERGY COMING DOWN ENERGY LEAVING
KaryMullis_2002 AND SO HE CAME UP WITH THIS THEORY AND HE SAID THIS WILL BE COOL BECAUSE IT'LL BE A LONGER GROWING SEASON IN SWEDEN YOU KNOW AND THE SURFERS LIKED
KaryMullis_2002 THE SURFERS THOUGHT THAT'S A COOL IDEA BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY COLD IN THE OCEAN SOMETIMES
KaryMullis_2002 A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE LATER ON STARTED THINKING IT WOULD BE BAD YOU KNOW BUT NOBODY ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATED
KaryMullis_2002 I MEAN THE TEMPERATURE AS MEASURED AND YOU CAN FIND THIS ON OUR WONDERFUL INTERNET YOU JUST GO AND LOOK FOR ALL NASAS RECORDS AND ALL THE WEATHER BUREAU 'S RECORDS AND YOU'LL LOOK AT IT YOURSELF AND YOU'LL SEE
KaryMullis_2002 THE TEMPERATURE HAS JUST THE NIGHTTIME TEMPERATURE MEASURED ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET HAS GONE UP A TINY LITTLE BIT SO IF YOU JUST AVERAGE THAT AND THE DAYTIME TEMPERATURE IT LOOKS LIKE IT WENT UP ABOUT SEVEN DEGREES IN THIS CENTURY
KaryMullis_2002 BUT IN FACT IT WAS JUST COMING UP IT WAS THE NIGHTTIME THE DAYTIME TEMPERATURES DIDN'T GO UP SO AND ARRHENIUS THEORY AND ALL THE GLOBAL WARMERS THINK THEY WOULD SAY YEAH IT SHOULD GO UP IN THE DAYTIME TOO
KaryMullis_2002 IF IT'S THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT NOW PEOPLE LIKE THINGS THAT HAVE LIKE NAMES LIKE THAT THAT THEY CAN ENVISION IT RIGHT I MEAN BUT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THINGS LIKE THIS SO MOST I MEAN YOU DON'T GET ALL EXCITED ABOUT THINGS
KaryMullis_2002 LIKE THE ACTUAL EVIDENCE YOU KNOW WHICH WOULD BE EVIDENCE FOR STRENGTHENING OF THE TROPICAL CIRCULATION IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES IT'S A PAPER THAT CAME OUT IN FEBRUARY AND MOST OF YOU PROBABLY HADN'T HEARD ABOUT IT
KaryMullis_2002 AND VILIKI AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE PRINCETON AND THOSE TWO PAPERS CAME OUT IN SCIENCE MAGAZINE FEBRUARY THE FIRST
KaryMullis_2002 AND THESE THE CONCLUSION IN BOTH OF THESE PAPERS AND IN ALSO THE SCIENCE EDITOR 'S LIKE DESCRIPTIONS OF THESE PAPERS FOR YOU KNOW FOR THE
KaryMullis_2002 IS THAT OUR THEORIES ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING ARE COMPLETELY WRONG I MEAN WHAT THESE GUYS WERE DOING AND THIS IS WHAT THE NASA PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR A LONG TIME THEY SAY IF YOU MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE IT ISN'T GOING UP
KaryMullis_2002 IT'S NOT GOING UP AT ALL WE'VE DOING IT VERY CAREFULLY NOW FOR TWENTY YEARS FROM SATELLITES AND IT ISN'T GOING UP AND IN THIS PAPER THEY SHOW SOMETHING MUCH MORE STRIKING AND THAT WAS
KaryMullis_2002 REALLY GET DOWN
KaryMullis_2002 THE SUN PUTS OUT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ENERGY WE KNOW HOW MUCH THAT IS IT FALLS ON THE EARTH THE EARTH GIVES BACK A CERTAIN AMOUNT WHEN IT GETS WARM IT GENERATES IT MAKES REDDER ENERGY I MEAN LIKE INFRA RED LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S WARM GIVES
KaryMullis_2002 THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF THE GLOBAL WARMING TRASH REALLY IS THAT IF THE IF THERE'S TOO MUCH CO TWO IN THE ATMOSPHERE THE HEAT THAT'S TRYING TO ESCAPE WON 'T BE ABLE TO GET OUT
KaryMullis_2002 SO YOU STILL GET HEATED BUT YOU DON'T DISSIPATE ANY WELL THESE GUYS MEASURED ALL OF THOSE THINGS I MEAN YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THAT STUFF AND YOU CAN WRITE THESE LARGE REPORTS
KaryMullis_2002 GOVERNMENT MONEY TO DO IT BUT THESE THEY ACTUALLY MEASURED IT AND IT TURNS OUT THAT IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT'S
KaryMullis_2002 THAT THE ENERGY THAT THE LEVEL OF WHAT THEY CALL IMBALANCE HAS BEEN WAY THE HELL OVER WHAT WAS EXPECTED LIKE THE AMOUNT OF IMBALANCE MEANING
KaryMullis_2002 ENERGY BUDGET BY ABOUT IN OTHER WORDS ONE WATT PER SQUARE CENTIMETER MORE WOULD BE COMING IN THAN GOING OUT SO THE PLANET SHOULD GET WARMER WELL THEY FOUND OUT IN THIS STUDY THESE TWO STUDIES BY TWO DIFFERENT TEAMS
KaryMullis_2002 SO THE THEORY 'S KAPUT IT'S NOTHING THESE PAPERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED THE END TO THE GLOBAL WARMING FIASCO YOU KNOW THEY'RE CONCERNED AND YOU CAN TELL THEY HAVE VERY GUARDED CONCLUSIONS IN THESE PAPERS BECAUSE
KaryMullis_2002 THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT BIG LABORATORIES THAT ARE FUNDED BY LOTS OF MONEY AND BY SCARED PEOPLE YOU KNOW IF THEY SAID YOU KNOW WHAT THERE ISN'T A PROBLEM WITH GLOBAL WARMING ANY LONGER SO WE CAN YOU
KaryMullis_2002 THEY'RE FUNDING AND IF YOU START A GRANT REQUEST WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SAY GLOBAL WARMING OBVIOUSLY HADN'T HAPPENED IF THEY IF THEY IF THEY ACTUALLY IF THEY ACTUALLY SAID THAT
KaryMullis_2002 WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WHAT WE'VE BEEN THINKING WAS THE GLOBAL CIRCULATION MODEL THAT WE PREDICT THAT THE EARTH IS GOING TO GET OVERHEATED THAT IT'S ALL WRONG IT'S WRONG BY A LARGE FACTOR
KaryMullis_2002 NOT BY A SMALL ONE THEY JUST THEY JUST MISINTERPRETED THE FACT THAT THE EARTH THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME MECHANISMS GOING ON THAT NOBODY KNEW ABOUT
KaryMullis_2002 THAT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THEM THEN YOU HAVE TO GET DOWN THE DETAILS AND READ THE PAPERS CALLED LARGE DECADAL VARIABILITY IN THE YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ALL THOSE WORDS MEAN
KaryMullis_2002 ONE OF
KaryMullis_2002 AND THE ASTEROIDS IS THE ONE I REALLY AGREE WITH THERE I MEAN YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH OUT FOR ASTEROIDS OK THANK YOU FOR
