JacquelineNovogratz_2005G TO START WITH A STORY A LA SETH GODIN FROM WHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD MY UNCLE ED GAVE ME A BEAUTIFUL BLUE SWEATER AT LEAST I THOUGHT IT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND IT HAD FUZZY ZEBRAS WALKING ACROSS THE STOMACH AND
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G ONE DAY IN NINTH GRADE WHEN I WAS STANDING WITH A NUMBER OF THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS AND MY BODY HAD CLEARLY CHANGED AND MATT MUSSOLINA WHO WAS
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G UNDENIABLY MY NEMESIS IN HIGH SCHOOL SAID IN A BOOMING VOICE THAT WE NO LONGER HAD TO GO FAR AWAY TO GO ON SKI TRIPS BUT WE COULD ALL SKI ON MOUNT NOVOGRATZ AND
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G SO HUMILIATED AND MORTIFIED THAT I IMMEDIATELY RAN HOME TO MY MOTHER AND CHASTISED HER FOR EVER LETTING ME WEAR THE HIDEOUS SWEATER WE DROVE TO THE GOODWILL AND WE THREW THE SWEATER AWAY SOMEWHAT CEREMONIOUSLY
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G MY IDEA BEING THAT I WOULD NEVER HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE SWEATER NOR SEE IT EVER AGAIN FAST FORWARD ELEVEN YEARS LATER I'M A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD KID
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G I'M WORKING IN KIGALI RWANDA JOGGING THROUGH THE STEEP SLOPES WHEN I SEE TEN FEET IN FRONT OF ME A LITTLE BOY ELEVEN YEARS OLD RUNNING TOWARD ME WEARING MY SWEATER
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G AND I'M THINKING NO THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE BUT SO CURIOUS I RUN UP TO THE CHILD OF COURSE SCARING THE LIVING BEJESUS OUT OF HIM
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G AND CONTINUES TO SERVE AS A METAPHOR TO ME ABOUT THE LEVEL OF CONNECTEDNESS THAT WE ALL HAVE ON THIS EARTH WE SO OFTEN DON'T REALIZE WHAT OUR ACTION AND OUR INACTION DOES TO PEOPLE WE THINK WE WILL NEVER SEE AND NEVER
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G I ALSO TELL IT BECAUSE IT TELLS A LARGER CONTEXTUAL STORY OF WHAT AID IS AND CAN BE THAT THIS TRAVELED INTO THE GOODWILL IN VIRGINIA
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G AND MOVED ITS WAY INTO THE LARGER INDUSTRY WHICH AT THAT POINT WAS GIVING MILLIONS OF TONS OF SECONDHAND CLOTHING TO AFRICA AND ASIA WHICH WAS A VERY GOOD THING PROVIDING LOW COST CLOTHING AND AT THE SAME TIME CERTAINLY IN RWANDA IT DESTROYED THE LOCAL RETAILING INDUSTRY
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G NOT TO SAY THAT IT SHOULDN 'T HAVE BUT THAT WE HAVE TO GET BETTER AT ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN WE THINK ABOUT CONSEQUENCES AND RESPONSES
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G UNWED MOTHERS WE WERE CALLED THE BAD NEWS BEARS AND OUR NOTION WAS WE WERE GOING TO CORNER THE SNACK FOOD BUSINESS IN KIGALI WHICH WAS NOT HARD BECAUSE THERE WERE NO SNACKS BEFORE US
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G AND BECAUSE WE HAD A GOOD BUSINESS MODEL WE ACTUALLY DID IT AND I WATCHED THESE WOMEN TRANSFORM ON A MICRO LEVEL BUT AT THE SAME TIME I STARTED A MICRO FINANCE BANK AND TOMORROW IQBAL QUADIR IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT GRAMEEN WHICH IS
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G WHAT WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING ALL AROUND US WITH THE CONFLUENCE OF FEAR
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G ETHNIC STRIFE AND CERTAINLY AN AID GAME IF YOU WILL THAT WAS PLAYING INTO THIS INVISIBLE BUT CERTAINLY PALPABLE
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G THE BANKING INSTITUTION LASTED IN FACT IT BECAME THE LARGEST REHABILITATION LENDER IN THE COUNTRY THE BAKERY WAS COMPLETELY WIPED OUT BUT THE LESSONS FOR ME WERE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY COUNTS
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G GOT TO BUILD THINGS WITH PEOPLE ON THE GROUND USING BUSINESS MODELS WHERE AS STEVEN LEVITT WOULD SAY THE INCENTIVES MATTER UNDERSTAND HOWEVER COMPLEX WE
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G INCENTIVES MATTER SO WHEN CHRIS RAISED TO ME HOW WONDERFUL EVERYTHING THAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD THAT WE WERE SEEING A SHIFT IN ZEITGEIST
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G ON THE ONE HAND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH HIM AND I WAS SO THRILLED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE G EIGHT THAT THE WORLD BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE TONY BLAIR AND BONO AND BOB GELDOF
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G THE WORLD IS TALKING ABOUT GLOBAL POVERTY THE WORLD IS TALKING ABOUT AFRICA IN WAYS I HAVE NEVER SEEN IN MY LIFE IT'S THRILLING AND AT THE SAME TIME WHAT KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT IS A FEAR THAT WE'LL LOOK
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G AS THE VICTORY AS MORE THAN CHAPTER ONE AS OUR MORAL ABSOLUTION AND IN FACT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS SEE THAT AS CHAPTER ONE
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G AND IF YOU REMEMBER ONE THING FROM WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IT'S THAT THE ONLY WAY TO END POVERTY TO MAKE IT HISTORY IS TO BUILD
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G WHOLE PHILOSOPHY THAT ENCOURAGED ME TO START MY CURRENT ENDEAVOR CALLED ACUMEN FUND WHICH IS TRYING TO BUILD SOME MINI BLUEPRINTS FOR HOW WE MIGHT DO THAT IN WATER HEALTH AND HOUSING IN PAKISTAN INDIA
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G KENYA TANZANIA AND EGYPT AND I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AND SOME OF THE EXAMPLES SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE DOING
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G STRONG HUGE MASSES OF PEOPLE YEARNING TO BE FREE WHEN IN FACT IT'S QUITE AN AMAZING STORY ON A MACRO LEVEL
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G WHERE WE TYPICALLY WORK THERE'S PEOPLE MAKING BETWEEN ONE AND THREE DOLLARS A DAY WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE THEY ARE FARMERS AND FACTORY WORKERS THEY'RE WORKING IN GOVERNMENT OFFICES THEY'RE DRIVERS THEY
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G THE POOR ALSO ARE WILLING TO MAKE AND DO MAKE SMART DECISIONS IF YOU GIVE THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY SO TWO EXAMPLES
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G ONE IS IN INDIA WHERE THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION FARMERS MOST OF WHOM MAKE LESS THAN TWO DOLLARS A DAY WHERE WE WORK IN AURANGABAD THE LAND IS EXTRAORDINARILY PARCHED
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G YOU SEE PEOPLE ON AVERAGE MAKING SIXTY CENTS TO A DOLLAR THIS GUY IN PINK IS A SOCIAL ENTREPRENEUR NAMED AMI TABAR WHAT HE DID WAS SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN ISRAEL LARGER APPROACHES AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO A DRIP IRRIGATION WHICH IS A WAY
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G OF BRINGING WATER DIRECTLY TO THE PLANT STOCK BUT PREVIOUSLY IT'S ONLY BEEN CREATED FOR LARGE SCALE FARMS SO AMI TABAR TOOK THIS AND MODULARIZED IT DOWN TO
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G A COUPLE OF PRINCIPLES BUILD SMALL MAKE IT INFINITELY EXPANDABLE AND AFFORDABLE TO THE POOR
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G THIS FAMILY SARITA AND HER HUSBAND BOUGHT A FIFTEEN DOLLAR UNIT WHEN THEY WERE LIVING IN A LITERALLY A THREE WALLED LEAN TO WITH A CORRUGATED IRON
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G ROOF AFTER ONE HARVEST THEY HAD INCREASED THEIR INCOME ENOUGH TO BUY A SECOND SYSTEM TO DO THEIR FULL QUARTER ACRE
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G I TRULY BELIEVE YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT POVERTY TODAY WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT MALARIA BED NETS AND I AGAIN GIVE JEFFREY SACHS OF HARVARD HUGE KUDOS FOR BRINGING TO THE WORLD THIS NOTION
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G OF HIS RAGE FOR FIVE DOLLARS YOU CAN SAVE A LIFE MALARIA IS A DISEASE THAT KILLS ONE TO THREE MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION CASES ARE REPORTED IT'S ESTIMATED THAT AFRICA LOSES ABOUT THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO THE DISEASE
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G THE QUESTION THOUGH IS NOT WHY CAN'T WE THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN WE HELP AFRICANS DO THIS FOR THEMSELVES A LOT OF HURDLES ONE PRODUCTION IS TOO LOW TWO PRICE IS TOO HIGH THREE
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G THIS IS A GOOD ROAD IN RIGHT NEAR WHERE OUR FACTORY IS LOCATED DISTRIBUTION IS A NIGHTMARE BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE WE STARTED BY MAKING A THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR LOAN TO THE LARGEST TRADITIONAL BED NET MANUFACTURER IN AFRICA SO THAT THEY COULD
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G TRANSFER TECHNOLOGY FROM JAPAN AND BUILD THESE LONG LASTING FIVE YEAR NETS HERE ARE JUST SOME PICTURES OF THE FACTORY TODAY THREE YEARS LATER THE COMPANY HAS EMPLOYED ANOTHER THOUSAND WOMEN
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G IT CONTRIBUTES ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN WAGES TO THE ECONOMY OF TANZANIA IT'S THE LARGEST COMPANY IN TANZANIA
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G THE THROUGHPUT RATE RIGHT NOW IS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION NETS THREE MILLION BY THE END OF THE YEAR WE HOPE TO HAVE SEVEN MILLION AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G SO THE PRODUCTION SIDE IS WORKING ON THE DISTRIBUTION SIDE THOUGH AS A WORLD WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO RIGHT NOW NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THESE NETS ARE BEING BOUGHT BY THE U N AND THEN GIVEN PRIMARILY TO PEOPLE
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G PEOPLE THEIR WOMEN AND SO I WANT YOU TO MEET JACQUELINE MY NAMESAKE TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD IF SHE WERE BORN ANYWHERE ELSE BUT TANZANIA I'M TELLING YOU SHE COULD RUN WALL STREET SHE RUNS TWO OF THE LINES
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G AND FIND A WAY FOR THE WOMEN THEMSELVES TO GO OUT AND SELL THESE NETS TO OTHERS SHE QUICKLY STARTED CALCULATING WHAT SHE HERSELF COULD MAKE AND SIGNED UP WE
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G NOT COMING IN WITH OUR OWN NOTIONS BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT MALARIA UNTIL THE VERY END FIRST SHE TALKED ABOUT COMFORT STATUS BEAUTY
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G THESE NETS SHE SAID YOU PUT THEM ON THE FLOOR BUGS LEAVE YOUR HOUSE CHILDREN CAN SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT THE HOUSE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL YOU HANG THEM IN THE WINDOW AND WE'VE STARTED MAKING CURTAINS
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G AND NOT ONLY IS IT BEAUTIFUL BUT PEOPLE CAN SEE STATUS THAT YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN ONLY THEN DID SHE TALK ABOUT SAVING YOUR
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G CHILDREN 'S LIVES A LOT OF LESSONS TO BE LEARNED IN TERMS OF HOW WE SELL GOODS AND SERVICES TO THE POOR
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G I WANT TO END JUST BY SAYING THAT THERE'S ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE POVERTY HISTORY TO DO IT RIGHT
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G WE HAVE TO BUILD BUSINESS MODELS THAT MATTER THAT ARE SCALEABLE AND THAT WORK WITH AFRICANS INDIANS PEOPLE ALL OVER THE DEVELOPING WORLD WHO FIT IN THIS CATEGORY
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G TO DO IT THEMSELVES BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S ABOUT ENGAGEMENT IT'S ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THAT PEOPLE REALLY DON'T WANT HANDOUTS THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS THEY WANT TO SOLVE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS AND THAT BY ENGAGING WITH THEM
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G NOT ONLY DO WE CREATE MUCH MORE DIGNITY FOR THEM BUT FOR US AS WELL AND SO I URGE ALL OF YOU TO THINK NEXT TIME AS TO HOW TO ENGAGE WITH THIS NOTION
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G AND THIS OPPORTUNITY THAT WE ALL HAVE TO MAKE POVERTY HISTORY BY REALLY BECOMING PART OF THE PROCESS AND MOVING AWAY FROM AN US AND THEM WORLD AND REALIZING THAT IT'S ABOUT ALL OF US AND THE KIND OF WORLD THAT WE TOGETHER WANT TO LIVE IN AND SHARE THANK YOU
