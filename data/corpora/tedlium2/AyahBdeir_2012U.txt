AyahBdeir_2012U@26.27:40.71 VERY QUICKLY CONCRETE BLOCKS BECAME THE MOST USED CONSTRUCTION UNIT IN THE WORLD THEY ENABLED US TO TO BUILD THINGS THAT WERE LARGER THAN US BUILDINGS BRIDGES ONE BRICK AT A TIME ESSENTIALLY CONCRETE BLOCKS HAD BECOME THE BUILDING BLOCK OF OUR TIME
AyahBdeir_2012U@46.89:59.77 IT WAS CALLED THE AUTOMATIC BINDING BRICK AND IN A FEW SHORT YEARS LEGO BRICKS TOOK PLACE IN EVERY HOUSEHOLD IT 'S ESTIMATED THAT OVER FOUR HUNDRED BILLION BRICKS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED OR SEVENTY FIVE BRICKS FOR EVERY PERSON ON THE PLANET
AyahBdeir_2012U@74.06:90.06 MEANWHILE THE EXACT SAME YEAR AT BELL LABS THE NEXT REVOLUTION WAS ABOUT TO BE ANNOUNCED THE NEXT BUILDING BLOCK THE TRANSISTOR WAS A SMALL PLASTIC UNIT THAT WOULD TAKE US FROM A WORLD OF STATIC BRICKS PILED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER TO A WORLD WHERE EVERYTHING WAS INTERACTIVE
AyahBdeir_2012U@90.06:96.73 LIKE THE CONCRETE BLOCK THE TRANSISTOR ALLOWS YOU TO BUILD MUCH LARGER MORE COMPLEX CIRCUITS ONE BRICK AT A TIME
AyahBdeir_2012U@96.81:98.46 BUT THERE 'S A MAIN DIFFERENCE
AyahBdeir_2012U@98.5:107.57 THE TRANSISTOR WAS ONLY FOR EXPERTS I PERSONALLY DON 'T ACCEPT THIS THAT THE BUILDING BLOCK OF OUR TIME IS RESERVED FOR EXPERTS SO I DECIDED TO CHANGE THAT
AyahBdeir_2012U@107.98:116.74 EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS AT THE MEDIA LAB I STARTED EXPLORING THIS IDEA OF HOW TO PUT THE POWER OF ENGINEERS IN THE HANDS OF ARTISTS AND DESIGNERS
AyahBdeir_2012U@117.26:121.46 A FEW YEARS AGO I STARTED DEVELOPING LITTLEBITS LET ME SHOW YOU HOW THEY WORK
AyahBdeir_2012U@127.77:129.94 WITH EACH ONE SPECIFIC FUNCTION
AyahBdeir_2012U@130.33:133.42 THEY 'RE PRE ENGINEERED TO BE LIGHT
AyahBdeir_2012U@137.3:145.89 AND THE BEST PART ABOUT IT IS THEY SNAP TOGETHER WITH MAGNETS SO YOU CAN 'T PUT THEM THE WRONG WAY
AyahBdeir_2012U@145.98:158.5 THE BRICKS ARE COLOR CODED GREEN IS OUTPUT BLUE IS POWER PINK IS INPUT AND ORANGE IS WIRE SO ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS SNAP A BLUE TO A GREEN AND VERY QUICKLY YOU CAN START MAKING LARGER CIRCUITS
AyahBdeir_2012U@158.91:161.72 YOU PUT A BLUE TO A GREEN YOU CAN MAKE LIGHT
AyahBdeir_2012U@162.19:164.93 YOU CAN PUT A KNOB IN BETWEEN
AyahBdeir_2012U@178.19:180.08 AND NOW YOU 'VE MADE A LITTLE BLINKER
AyahBdeir_2012U@268.06:272.65 HERE 'S AN EXAMPLE OF A PROJECT THEY MADE A MOTION ACTIVATED CONFETTI CANON BALL
AyahBdeir_2012U@283.72:285.33 THAT 'S AFRAID OF THE DARK
AyahBdeir_2012U@306.07:311.1 OF CONTRIBUTORS BECAUSE THIS WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN THIS INTERACTIVE WORLD IS OURS
AyahBdeir_2012U@311.13:314.15 SO GO AHEAD AND START INVENTING THANK
