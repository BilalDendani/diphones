HansRosling_2009S@16.05:22.50 I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT YOUR MINDSET DOES YOUR MINDSET CORRESPOND TO MY DATASET
HansRosling_2009S@24.17:35.60 IF NOT ONE OR THE OTHER NEEDS UPGRADING ISN'T IT WHEN I TALK TO MY STUDENTS ABOUT GLOBAL ISSUES AND I LISTEN TO THEM IN THE COFFEE BREAK THEY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT WE AND
HansRosling_2009S@36.60:44.72 AND WHEN THEY COME BACK INTO THE LECTURE ROOM I ASK THEM WHAT DO YOU MEAN WITH WE AND THEM OH IT'S VERY EASY IT'S THE WESTERN WORLD AND IT'S THE DEVELOPING WORLD THEY SAY WE
HansRosling_2009S@46.12:59.59 AND WHAT IS THE DEFINITION THEN THE DEFINITION EVERYONE KNOWS THEY SAY BUT THEN YOU KNOW I PRESS THEM LIKE THIS SO ONE GIRL SAID VERY CLEVERLY IT 'S VERY EASY WESTERN WORLD IS A LONG LIFE IN A SMALL FAMILY DEVELOPING WORLD IS A SHORT LIFE IN A LARGE
HansRosling_2009S@60.50:68.62 AND I LIKE THAT DEFINITION BECAUSE IT ENABLED ME TO TRANSFER THEIR MINDSET INTO THE DATASET AND HERE YOU HAVE THE DATASET
HansRosling_2009S@69.05:78.61 SO YOU CAN SEE THAT WHAT WE HAVE ON THIS AXIS HERE IS SIZE OF FAMILY ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE CHILDREN PER WOMAN ON THIS AXIS AND HERE LENGTH OF LIFE LIFE EXPECTANCY
HansRosling_2009S@78.92:88.65 THIRTY FORTY FIFTY EXACTLY WHAT THE STUDENTS SAID WAS THEIR CONCEPT ABOUT THE WORLD AND REALLY THIS IS ABOUT THE BEDROOM WHETHER MAN AND WOMAN
HansRosling_2009S@88.93:98.43 DECIDE TO HAVE SMALL FAMILY AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR KIDS AND HOW LONG THEY WILL LIVE IT'S ABOUT THE BATHROOM AND THE KITCHEN IF YOU HAVE SOAP WATER AND FOOD YOU KNOW YOU CAN LIVE
HansRosling_2009S@99.13:108.21 AND THE STUDENTS WERE RIGHT IT WASN'T THAT THE WORLD CONSISTED THE WORLD CONSISTED HERE OF ONE SET OF COUNTRIES OVER HERE WHICH HAD LARGE FAMILIES AND SHORT LIFE
HansRosling_2009S@117.76:122.14 AND YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HERE THE AMAZING THING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE WORLD
HansRosling_2009S@122.43:130.78 DURING MY LIFETIME AND THEN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES APPLIED SOAP AND WATER VACCINATION AND ALL THE DEVELOPING WORLD START TO APPLY FAMILY PLANNING
HansRosling_2009S@131.04:137.71 AND PARTLY TO USA WHO HELP TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ADVICE AND INVESTMENT AND YOU SEE ALL THE WORLD MOVES OVER
HansRosling_2009S@138.03:148.68 TO A TWO CHILD FAMILY AND A LIFE WITH SIXTY TO SEVENTY YEARS BUT SOME COUNTRIES REMAIN BACK IN THIS AREA HERE AND YOU CAN SEE WE STILL HAVE AFGHANISTAN DOWN HERE
HansRosling_2009S@148.90:158.38 WE HAVE LIBERIA WE HAVE CONGO SO WE HAVE COUNTRIES LIVING THERE SO THE PROBLEM I HAD IS THAT THE WORLDVIEW THAT MY STUDENTS
HansRosling_2009S@159.81:164.17 CORRESPOND TO REALITY IN THE WORLD THE YEAR THEIR TEACHERS WERE BORN
HansRosling_2009S@170.32:177.62 AND WE IN FACT WHEN WE HAVE PLAYED THIS OVER THE WORLD I WAS AT THE GLOBAL HEALTH CONFERENCE HERE IN WASHINGTON LAST WEEK AND I COULD SEE THAT
HansRosling_2009S@178.17:186.97 THE WRONG CONCEPT EVEN ACTIVE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES HAD THAT THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THE IMPROVEMENT OF MEXICO THERE
HansRosling_2009S@187.26:193.02 AND CHINA IN RELATION TO UNITED STATES LOOK HERE WHEN I MOVE THEM FORWARD HERE WE GO
HansRosling_2009S@217.74:228.82 BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIS STRANGE RELATIONSHIP TO THE UNITED STATES YOU KNOW BUT IF I WOULD CHANGE THIS AXIS HERE LOOK AND I WOULD INSTEAD HERE I WOULD PUT INCOME PER PERSON
HansRosling_2009S@229.38:240.96 INCOME PER PERSON I CAN PUT THAT HERE AND WE WILL THEN SEE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PICTURE BY THE WAY I'M TEACHING YOU HOW TO USE OUR WEBSITE GAPMINDER WORLD WHILE I'M CORRECTING
HansRosling_2009S@258.79:268.88 AND NOW I HAVE INCOME PER PERSON ON THIS AXIS AND THE UNITED STATES ONLY HAD SOMEONE TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR AT THAT TIME AND THE LIFE EXPECTANCY WAS THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY YEARS ON PAR WITH
HansRosling_2009S@270.59:274.77 AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE WORLD
HansRosling_2009S@274.92:281.73 I WILL SHOW NOW THIS IS INSTEAD OF STUDYING HISTORY FOR ONE YEAR AT UNIVERSITY YOU CAN WATCH ME FOR ONE MINUTE NOW AND YOU'LL SEE
HansRosling_2009S@284.14:292.52 YOU CAN SEE HOW THE BROWN BUBBLES WHICH IS WEST EUROPE AND THE YELLOW ONE WHICH IS UNITED STATES
HansRosling_2009S@292.79:305.92 THEY GET RICHER AND RICHER AND ALSO START TO GET HEALTHIER AND HEALTHIER AND THIS IS NOW ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHERE THE AS THE REST OF THE WORLD REMAINS BEHIND HERE WE COME AND THAT WAS THE INFLUENZA
HansRosling_2009S@313.95:323.06 AND NOT UNTIL INDEPENDENCE STARTED LOOK HERE YOU HAVE CHINA OVER THERE YOU HAVE INDIA OVER THERE AND THIS IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED
HansRosling_2009S@329.35:342.56 YOU NOTE THERE THAT WE HAVE MEXICO UP THERE MEXICO IS NOT AT ALL ON PAR WITH THE UNITED STATES BUT THEY ARE QUITE CLOSE AND ESPECIALLY IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES DURING TWO HUNDRED YEARS
HansRosling_2009S@343.19:350.77 BECAUSE I HAVE MY OLDEST SON NOW WORKING FOR GOOGLE AFTER GOOGLE ACQUIRED THIS SOFTWARE BECAUSE IN FACT THIS IS CHILD LABOR MY SON AND HIS WIFE
HansRosling_2009S@356.21:365.11 WHO STUDIED CHINESE IN BEIJING SO THEY COME IN WITH THE TWO PERSPECTIVES I HAVE YOU KNOW AND MY SON YOUNGEST SON WHO STUDIED IN BEIJING IN CHINA HE GOT
HansRosling_2009S@367.71:372.11 WHEN MY OLDEST SON WHO WORK IN GOOGLE HE SHOULD DEVELOP BY QUARTER
HansRosling_2009S@372.50:384.61 OR BY HALF YEAR OR GOOGLE IS QUITE GENEROUS SO HE CAN HAVE ONE OR TWO YEARS TO GO BUT IN CHINA THEY LOOK GENERATION AFTER GENERATION BECAUSE THEY REMEMBER THE VERY EMBARRASSING PERIOD FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS WHERE THEY WENT
HansRosling_2009S@399.14:413.33 HEALTH TO CHINA AND THEN HE DIED AND THEN DENG XIAOPING STARTED THIS AMAZING MOVE FORWARD ISN'T IT STRANGE TO SEE THAT UNITED STATES FIRST GREW THE ECONOMY AND THEN GRADUALLY GOT RICH WHERE AS CHINA COULD GET HEALTHY MUCH
HansRosling_2009S@413.99:428.42 BECAUSE THEY APPLIED THE KNOWLEDGE OF EDUCATION NUTRITION AND THEN ALSO BENEFITS OF PENICILLIN AND VACCINES AND FAMILY PLANNING AND ASIA COULD HAVE SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT BEFORE THEY GOT THE ECONOMIC
HansRosling_2009S@429.05:440.03 SO TO ME AS A PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSOR IT'S NOT STRANGE THAT ALL THESE COUNTRIES GROW SO FAST NOW BECAUSE WHAT YOU SEE HERE WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS THE FLAT WORLD OF THOMAS FRIEDMAN ISN'T IT
HansRosling_2009S@441.23:447.83 IT'S NOT REALLY REALLY FLAT BUT THE MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES AND THIS IS WHERE I SUGGEST TO MY STUDENTS
HansRosling_2009S@457.73:466.61 THE LAST CHAPTER IS ABOUT THE PRESENT AND PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE OTHER IS ABOUT THE PAST WHERE YOU COVER EVERYTHING FROM WASHINGTON TO EISENHOWER
HansRosling_2009S@467.61:473.93 BECAUSE WASHINGTON TO EISENHOWER THAT IS WHAT WE FIND IN DEVELOPING WORLD WE COULD ACTUALLY GO FROM MAYFLOWER
HansRosling_2009S@475.66:484.76 AND THAT WOULD BE PUT TOGETHER INTO A DEVELOPING WORLD WHICH IS RIGHTLY GROWING ITS CITIES IN A VERY AMAZING WAY WHICH HAVE GREAT ENTREPRENEURS BUT ALSO HAVE
HansRosling_2009S@484.92:492.64 THE COLLAPSING COUNTRIES SO HOW COULD WE MAKE A BETTER SENSE ABOUT THIS WELL ONE WAY OF TRYING IS TO SEE WHETHER WE
HansRosling_2009S@493.02:502.14 LOOK AT INCOME DISTRIBUTION THIS IS THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION OF PEOPLES IN THE WORLD FROM ONE DOLLAR THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE FOOD TO EAT THESE PEOPLE GO TO BED HUNGRY
HansRosling_2009S@502.39:510.30 AND THIS IS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THIS IS TEN DOLLAR WHETHER YOU HAVE A PUBLIC OR A PRIVATE HEALTH SERVICE SYSTEM THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN PROVIDE HEALTH SERVICE FOR YOUR FAMILY
HansRosling_2009S@510.55:518.38 AND SCHOOL FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND THIS IS OECD COUNTRIES GREEN LATIN AMERICA EAST EUROPE THIS IS EAST ASIA AND THE LIGHT BLUE THERE
HansRosling_2009S@518.61:522.86 IS SOUTH ASIA AND THIS IS HOW THE WORLD CHANGED IT CHANGED LIKE THIS
HansRosling_2009S@524.39:538.13 YOU SEE HOW IT'S GROWING AND HOW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS AND BILLIONS IS COMING OUT OF POVERTY IN ASIA AND IT GOES OVER HERE AND I COME NOW INTO PROJECTIONS BUT I HAVE TO STOP AT THE DOOR OF LEHMAN BROTHERS THERE YOU KNOW BECAUSE
HansRosling_2009S@540.68:551.84 THE PROJECTIONS ARE NOT VALID ANY LONGER PROBABLY THE WORLD WILL DO THIS AND THEN IT WILL CONTINUE FORWARD LIKE THIS BUT MORE OR LESS THIS IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND WE HAVE A WORLD WHICH
HansRosling_2009S@552.02:559.26 CAN NOT BE LOOKED UPON AS DIVIDED WE HAVE THE HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES HERE WITH UNITED STATES AS A LEADING POWER
HansRosling_2009S@559.53:566.99 WE HAVE THE EMERGING ECONOMIES IN THE MIDDLE THAT PROVIDE A LOT OF THE FUNDING FOR THE BAILOUT AND WE HAVE THE LOW INCOME COUNTRIES
HansRosling_2009S@568.28:579.53 THIS IS A FACT THAT FROM WHERE THE MONEY COME THEY HAVE BEEN SAVING YOU KNOW OVER THE LAST DECADE AND HERE WE HAVE THE LOW INCOME COUNTRIES WHERE ENTREPRENEURS ARE AND HERE WE HAVE THE COUNTRIES IN COLLAPSE AND WAR LIKE
HansRosling_2009S@582.21:592.39 OF CONGO DARFUR WE HAVE ALL THIS AT THE SAME TIME THAT'S WHY IT'S SO PROBLEMATIC TO DESCRIBE WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD BECAUSE IT'S SO DIFFERENT WHAT HAS HAPPENED
HansRosling_2009S@592.78:605.18 AND THAT'S WHY I SUGGEST A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH OF WHAT YOU WOULD CALL IT AND YOU HAVE HUGE DIFFERENCE WITHIN COUNTRIES ALSO I HEARD THAT YOUR DEPARTMENTS HERE WERE BY REGIONS HERE YOU HAVE
HansRosling_2009S@605.88:617.36 AFRICA SOUTH ASIA EAST ASIA ARAB STATES EAST EUROPE LATIN AMERICA AND OECD AND ON THIS AXIS GDP AND ON THIS HEATH CHILD SURVIVAL AND IT DOESN'T COME AS A SURPRISE
HansRosling_2009S@617.53:627.68 THAT AFRICA SOUTH OF SAHARA IS AT THE BOTTOM BUT WHEN I SPLIT IT WHEN I SPLIT IT INTO COUNTRY BUBBLES THE SIZE OF THE BUBBLES HERE IS THE POPULATION THEN YOU SEE
HansRosling_2009S@630.61:643.56 SUCH A DIFFERENCE WITHIN SUB SAHARAN AFRICA AND I CAN SPLIT THE OTHERS HERE THE SOUTH ASIAN ARAB WORLD NOW ALL YOU DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS EAST EUROPE LATIN AMERICA AND OECD COUNTRIES AND HERE WERE ARE WE HAVE A
HansRosling_2009S@645.18:650.53 WE CAN NOT PUT IT INTO TWO PARTS IT IS MAYFLOWER DOWN HERE IT IS WASHINGTON HERE
HansRosling_2009S@651.04:658.70 BUILDING BUILDING COUNTRIES IT'S LINCOLN HERE ADVANCING THEM IT'S EISENHOWER BRINGING MODERNITY INTO THE
HansRosling_2009S@659.34:669.51 AND THEN IT'S UNITED STATES TODAY UP HERE AND WE HAVE COUNTRIES ALL THIS WAY NOW THIS IS THE IMPORTANT THING OF UNDERSTANDING HOW THE WORLD HAS CHANGED
HansRosling_2009S@676.09:680.30 AND IT IS MY TASK ON BEHALF OF THE REST OF THE WORLD TO CONVEY
HansRosling_2009S@680.97:682.83 TO THE U S TAXPAYERS
HansRosling_2009S@683.43:695.97 FOR DEMOGRAPHIC HEALTH SURVEY MANY ARE NOT AWARE OF NO THIS IS NOT A JOKE THIS IS VERY SERIOUS IT IS DUE TO USA 'S CONTINUOUS SPONSORING DURING TWENTY FIVE YEARS
HansRosling_2009S@696.17:702.70 OF THE VERY GOOD METHODOLOGY FOR MEASURING CHILD MORTALITY THAT WE HAVE A GRASP OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE
HansRosling_2009S@709.28:717.30 AND IT IS U S GOVERNMENT AT ITS BEST WITHOUT ADVOCACY PROVIDING FACTS THAT IT'S USEFUL FOR THE SOCIETY
HansRosling_2009S@717.67:726.36 AND PROVIDING DATA FREE OF CHARGE ON THE INTERNET FOR THE WORLD TO USE THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUITE IN THE OPPOSITE OF THE WORLD BANK WHO COMPILED
HansRosling_2009S@741.16:750.76 PEOPLE DOING THAT AT THE WORLD BANK ARE AMONG THE BEST IN THE WORLD AND THEY ARE HIGHLY SKILLED PROFESSIONALS IT'S JUST THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO UPGRADE OUR INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES
HansRosling_2009S@751.03:762.95 TO DEAL WITH THE WORLD IN A MODERN WAY AS WE DO AND WHEN IT COMES TO FREE DATA AND TRANSPARENCY UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS ONE OF THE BEST AND THAT DOESN'T COME EASY FROM THE MOUTH OF A SWEDISH PUBLIC HEALTH
HansRosling_2009S@766.03:773.40 AND I'M NOT PAID TO COME HERE NO I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE DATA WHAT WE CAN SHOW WITH THIS DATA LOOK HERE THIS IS
HansRosling_2009S@801.60:812.09 AS WE HAVE HAD ALWAYS IN HISTORY AND THAT'S THE BOTTOM BILLION WHERE WE'VE HEARD TODAY ABOUT A COMPLETELY NEW APPROACH TO DO IT AND HOW
HansRosling_2009S@813.16:824.28 HAS THIS HAPPENED WELL MDG FOUR UNITED STATES HAVE NOT BEEN SO EAGER TO USE MDG FOUR BUT YOU HAVE BEEN THE MAIN SPONSOR THAT HAS ENABLED US TO MEASURE
HansRosling_2009S@870.16:876.45 FIVE POINT FIVE PERCENT THEY ARE FASTER THAN MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOAL AND THIRD CHANCE FOR SWEDEN AGAINST BRAZIL HERE
HansRosling_2009S@883.40:889.54 THAN SWEDEN THIS MEANS THAT THE WORLD IS CONVERGING THE MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES THE EMERGING
HansRosling_2009S@890.05:898.47 THEY ARE CATCHING UP THEY ARE MOVING TO CITIES WHERE THEY WILL ALSO GET BETTER ASSISTANCE FOR THAT WHAT THE SWEDISH DO IS PROTEST AT THIS TIME THEY SAY THIS IS NOT
HansRosling_2009S@899.50:906.88 THESE COUNTRIES HAD VACCINE AND ANTIBIOTIC THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR SWEDEN WE HAVE TO DO REAL TIME COMPETITION OKAY I GIVE YOU SINGAPORE
HansRosling_2009S@907.20:914.94 THE YEAR I WAS BORN SINGAPORE HAD TWICE THE CHILD MORTALITY OF SWEDEN IT'S THE MOST TROPICAL COUNTRY IN THE WORLD A MARSHLAND ON THE EQUATOR AND HERE WE GO
HansRosling_2009S@915.31:924.41 IT TOOK A LITTLE TIME FOR THEM TO GET INDEPENDENT BUT THEN THEY STARTED TO GROW THEIR ECONOMY AND THEY MADE THE SOCIAL INVESTMENT THEY GOT AWAY MALARIA THEY GOT A MAGNIFICENT HEALTH SYSTEM THAT BEAT
HansRosling_2009S@925.53:927.34 WE NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD HAPPEN THAT THEY
HansRosling_2009S@936.59:947.20 THESE GREEN COUNTRIES ARE ACHIEVING MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS THESE YELLOW ARE JUST ABOUT TO DOING THIS THESE RED COUNTRIES THAT DOESN'T DO IT AND THE POLICY HAS TO BE IMPROVED NOT SIMPLISTIC EXTRAPOLATION
HansRosling_2009S@947.83:961.35 WE HAVE TO REALLY FIND A WAY OF SUPPORTING THOSE COUNTRIES IN A BETTER WAY WE HAVE TO RESPECT THE MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES ON WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND WE HAVE TO FACT BASE THE WHOLE WAY WE LOOK AT THE WORLD THIS IS DOLLAR PER PERSON THIS IS
HansRosling_2009S@961.98:969.33 IN THE COUNTRIES THE BLUE IS AFRICA THE SIZE OF THE BUBBLES IS HOW MANY ARE HIV AFFECTED YOU SEE THE TRAGEDY IN SOUTH AFRICA THERE
HansRosling_2009S@978.45:987.16 BUT YOU ALSO SEE THAT THERE ARE AFRICAN COUNTRIES DOWN HERE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN HIV EPIDEMIC IN AFRICA THERE'S A NUMBER FIVE TO
HansRosling_2009S@987.80:996.94 IN AFRICA THAT HAS THE SAME LEVEL AS SWEDEN AND UNITED STATES AND THERE ARE OTHERS WHO ARE EXTREMELY HIGH AND I WILL SHOW YOU THAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN
HansRosling_2009S@997.78:1006.79 ONE OF THE BEST COUNTRIES WITH THE MOST VIBRANT ECONOMY IN AFRICA AND A GOOD GOVERNANCE IS BOTSWANA THEY HAVE A VERY HIGH LEVEL IT'S COMING DOWN BUT NOW IT'S NOT
HansRosling_2009S@1007.54:1015.27 BECAUSE THERE WITH HELP FROM PEPFAR IT'S WORKING WITH TREATMENT AND PEOPLE ARE NOT DYING AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S NOT THAT
HansRosling_2009S@1015.82:1021.99 THAT IT IS WAR WHICH CAUSED THIS BECAUSE HERE IN CONGO THERE IS WAR AND HERE IN ZAMBIA THERE IS
HansRosling_2009S@1023.66:1036.28 AND IT'S NOT THE ECONOMY RICHER COUNTRY HAS A LITTLE HIGHER AND IF I SPLIT TANZANIA IN ITS INCOME THE RICHER TWENTY PERCENT IN TANZANIA HAS MORE HIV THAN THE POOREST ONE AND IT'S REALLY DIFFERENT WITHIN COUNTRY LOOK AT THE PROVINCES OF
HansRosling_2009S@1036.78:1050.10 THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND THIS IS THE SITUATION YOU SEE IT'S NOT DEEP POVERTY IT'S THE SPECIAL SITUATION PROBABLY OF CONCURRENT SEXUAL PARTNERSHIP AMONG PART OF THE HETEROSEXUAL POPULATION IN SOME
HansRosling_2009S@1050.68:1058.27 OR SOME PARTS OF COUNTRIES IN SOUTH AND EASTERN AFRICA DON'T MAKE IT AFRICA DON'T MAKE IT A RACE ISSUE MAKE IT A LOCAL ISSUE AND DO
HansRosling_2009S@1059.42:1066.66 AT EACH PLACE IN THE WAY IT CAN BE DONE THERE SO TO JUST END UP THERE ARE THINGS
HansRosling_2009S@1067.18:1077.71 OF SUFFERING IN THE ONE BILLION POOREST WHICH WE DON'T KNOW THOSE WHO LIVE BEYOND THE CELLPHONE THOSE WHO HAVE YET TO SEE A COMPUTER THOSE WHO HAVE NO ELECTRICITY AT
HansRosling_2009S@1078.31:1091.29 THIS IS THE DISEASE KONZO I SPENT TWENTY YEARS ELUCIDATING IN AFRICA IT'S CAUSED BY FAST PROCESSING OF TOXIC CASSAVA ROOT IN FAMINE SITUATION IT'S SIMILAR TO THE PELLAGRA EPIDEMIC IN MISSISSIPPI IN THE
HansRosling_2009S@1091.92:1100.83 IT'S SIMILAR TO OTHER NUTRITIONAL DISEASES IT WILL NEVER AFFECT A RICH PERSON WE HAVE SEEN IT HERE IN MOZAMBIQUE THIS IS THE EPIDEMIC IN MOZAMBIQUE
HansRosling_2009S@1101.97:1111.60 IN NORTHERN TANZANIA YOU NEVER HEARD ABOUT THE DISEASE BUT IT'S MUCH MORE THAN EBOLA THAT HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS DISEASE CAUSE CRIPPLING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND OVER THE LAST
HansRosling_2009S@1117.15:1130.16 THE ILLEGAL DIAMOND TRADE FROM THE UNITA DOMINATED AREA IN ANGOLA THAT HAS NOW DISAPPEARED AND THEY ARE NOW IN GREAT ECONOMICAL PROBLEM AND ONE WEEK AGO FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE WERE FOUR LINES ON THE
HansRosling_2009S@1131.58:1141.08 DON'T GET CONFUSED OF THE PROGRESS OF THE EMERGING ECONOMIES AND THE GREAT CAPACITY OF PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES AND IN PEACEFUL LOW INCOME COUNTRIES
HansRosling_2009S@1141.31:1151.55 THERE IS STILL MYSTERY IN ONE BILLION AND WE HAVE TO HAVE MORE CONCEPT THAN JUST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND DEVELOPING WORLD WE NEED A NEW MINDSET THE WORLD IS CONVERGING
HansRosling_2009S@1153.30:1161.52 NOT THE BOTTOM BILLION THEY ARE STILL AS POOR AS THEY'VE EVER BEEN IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE AND IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AROUND ONE SUPERPOWER
HansRosling_2009S@1162.52:1163.03 BUT
HansRosling_2009S@1163.78:1176.74 YOU WILL REMAIN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SUPERPOWER AND THE MOST HOPEFUL SUPERPOWER FOR THE TIME TO BE AND THIS INSTITUTION WILL HAVE A VERY CRUCIAL ROLE NOT FOR UNITED STATES BUT FOR THE WORLD
HansRosling_2009S@1177.04:1185.35 SO YOU HAVE A VERY BAD NAME STATE DEPARTMENT THIS IS NOT THE STATE DEPARTMENT IT'S THE WORLD DEPARTMENT AND WE HAVE A HIGH HOPE IN YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH
