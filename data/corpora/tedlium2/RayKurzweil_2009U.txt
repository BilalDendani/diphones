RayKurzweil_2009U@22.28:35.22 AND OUR INTUITION IS LINEAR WHEN WE WALKED THROUGH THE SAVANNA A THOUSAND YEARS AGO WE MADE LINEAR PREDICTIONS WHERE THAT ANIMAL WOULD BE AND THAT WORKED FINE IT'S HARDWIRED IN OUR BRAINS BUT THE PACE OF EXPONENTIAL GROWTH IS REALLY WHAT DESCRIBES
RayKurzweil_2009U@47.38:58.34 TAKE THIRTY STEPS EXPONENTIALLY TWO FOUR EIGHT SIXTEEN I GET TO A BILLION IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE AND THAT REALLY DESCRIBES INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT MIT
RayKurzweil_2009U@67.49:79.27 THAT'S A BILLION FOLD INCREASE IN CAPABILITY PER DOLLAR THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED SINCE I WAS A STUDENT AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN IN THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROGRESSES THROUGH A SERIES OF S CURVES
RayKurzweil_2009U@88.46:96.80 AND MOORE 'S LAW WAS NOT THE FIRST PARADIGM TO BRING EXPONENTIAL GROWTH TO COMPUTING THE EXPONENTIAL GROWTH OF COMPUTING STARTED DECADES BEFORE GORDON MOORE WAS EVEN BORN
RayKurzweil_2009U@118.58:132.93 IN NINETEEN FIFTIES THEY WERE SHRINKING VACUUM TUBES MAKING THEM SMALLER AND SMALLER THEY FINALLY HIT A WALL THEY COULDN'T SHRINK THE VACUUM TUBE ANY MORE AND KEEP THE VACUUM AND THAT WAS THE END OF THE SHRINKING OF VACUUM TUBES BUT IT WAS NOT THE END OF THE EXPONENTIAL GROWTH OF COMPUTING WE WENT TO THE FOURTH PARADIGM
RayKurzweil_2009U@155.24:167.48 MADE NOT A DENT IN THIS EXPONENTIAL PROGRESSION WE'LL SEE THE SAME THING IN THE ECONOMIC RECESSION WE'RE HAVING NOW AT LEAST THE EXPONENTIAL GROWTH OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITY WILL CONTINUE UNABATED
RayKurzweil_2009U@168.08:175.95 AND I JUST UPDATED THESE GRAPHS BECAUSE I HAD THEM THROUGH TWO THOUSAND AND TWO IN MY BOOK THE SINGULARITY IS NEAR SO WE UPDATED THEM SO I COULD PRESENT IT HERE
RayKurzweil_2009U@176.30:183.51 TO TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND I WAS ASKED WELL AREN'T YOU NERVOUS MAYBE IT KIND OF DIDN'T STAY ON THIS EXPONENTIAL PROGRESSION
RayKurzweil_2009U@184.19:192.19 WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS BECAUSE MAYBE THE DATA WOULDN'T BE RIGHT BUT I'VE DONE THIS NOW FOR THIRTY YEARS AND IT HAS STAYED ON THIS EXPONENTIAL PROGRESSION
RayKurzweil_2009U@199.99:207.98 BUT LOOK AT HOW PREDICTABLE THIS IS AND I'D SAY THIS KNOWLEDGE IS OVER FITTING TO PAST DATA I'VE BEEN MAKING THESE FORWARD LOOKING PREDICTIONS FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS
RayKurzweil_2009U@208.65:220.33 AND THE COST OF A TRANSISTOR CYCLE WHICH IS A MEASURE OF THE PRICE PERFORMANCE OF ELECTRONICS COMES DOWN ABOUT EVERY YEAR THAT'S A FIFTY PERCENT DEFLATION RATE AND IT'S ALSO TRUE OF OTHER EXAMPLES LIKE DNA DATA OR BRAIN DATA
RayKurzweil_2009U@220.86:227.80 BUT WE MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR THAT WE ACTUALLY SHIP MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH OF EVERY FORM OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WE'VE HAD EIGHTEEN PERCENT GROWTH
RayKurzweil_2009U@228.07:235.75 IN CONSTANT DOLLARS IN EVERY FORM OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR THE LAST HALF CENTURY DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU CAN GET TWICE AS MUCH OF IT EACH YEAR
RayKurzweil_2009U@236.65:246.29 THIS IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EXAMPLE THIS IS NOT MOORE 'S LAW THE AMOUNT OF DNA DATA WE'VE SEQUENCED HAS DOUBLED EVERY YEAR THE COST HAS COME DOWN BY HALF
RayKurzweil_2009U@246.80:257.97 EVERY YEAR AND THIS HAS BEEN A SMOOTH PROGRESSION SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE GENOME PROJECT AND HALFWAY THROUGH THE PROJECT SKEPTICS SAID THIS IS NOT WORKING OUT YOU'RE HALFWAY THROUGH THE GENOME PROJECT AND YOU'VE FINISHED ONE PERCENT
RayKurzweil_2009U@258.34:267.17 OF THE PROJECT BUT THAT WAS REALLY RIGHT ON SCHEDULE BECAUSE IF YOU DOUBLE ONE PERCENT SEVEN MORE TIMES WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED YOU GET ONE HUNDRED PERCENT AND THE PROJECT WAS FINISHED ON TIME
RayKurzweil_2009U@278.64:288.10 I WROTE OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO IN THE AGE OF INTELLIGENT MACHINES WHEN THE SOVIET UNION WAS GOING STRONG THAT IT WOULD BE SWEPT AWAY BY THIS GROWTH OF DECENTRALIZED COMMUNICATION
RayKurzweil_2009U@288.61:299.73 AND WE WILL HAVE PLENTY OF COMPUTATION AS WE GO THROUGH THE TWENTY ONE ST CENTURY TO DO THINGS LIKE SIMULATE REGIONS OF THE HUMAN BRAIN BUT WHERE WILL WE GET THE SOFTWARE SOME CRITICS SAY OH WELL SOFTWARE IS STUCK IN THE MUD
RayKurzweil_2009U@300.27:310.43 BUT WE ARE LEARNING MORE AND MORE ABOUT THE HUMAN BRAIN SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF BRAIN SCANNING IS DOUBLING EVERY YEAR THE AMOUNT OF DATA WE'RE GETTING ABOUT THE BRAIN IS DOUBLING EVERY YEAR AND WE'RE SHOWING THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY TURN THIS
RayKurzweil_2009U@311.43:317.79 INTO WORKING MODELS AND SIMULATIONS OF BRAIN REGIONS THERE IS ABOUT TWENTY REGIONS OF THE BRAIN THAT HAVE BEEN MODELED SIMULATED
RayKurzweil_2009U@318.52:327.39 THE AUDITORY CORTEX REGIONS OF THE VISUAL CORTEX CEREBELLUM WHERE WE DO OUR SKILL FORMATION SLICES OF THE CEREBRAL CORTEX WHERE WE DO OUR RATIONAL THINKING
RayKurzweil_2009U@341.48:349.82 AND WE'RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT WELL THIS IS A LOGARITHMIC GRAPH THIS REPRESENTS A SMOOTH DOUBLING EVERY TWO YEARS
RayKurzweil_2009U@350.11:356.08 OF THE AMOUNT OF SOLAR ENERGY WE'RE CREATING PARTICULARLY AS WE'RE NOW APPLYING NANOTECHNOLOGY A FORM OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
RayKurzweil_2009U@356.42:364.94 TO SOLAR PANELS AND WE'RE ONLY EIGHT DOUBLINGS AWAY FROM IT MEETING ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF OUR ENERGY NEEDS AND THERE IS TEN THOUSAND TIMES MORE SUNLIGHT THAN WE NEED
RayKurzweil_2009U@379.05:388.48 IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND WE WILL BEGIN TO ACTUALLY DEEPLY INFLUENCE OUR HEALTH AND OUR INTELLIGENCE AS WE GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THIS TECHNOLOGY
RayKurzweil_2009U@389.49:402.53 BASED ON THAT WE ARE ANNOUNCING HERE AT TED IN TRUE TED TRADITION SINGULARITY UNIVERSITY IT'S A NEW UNIVERSITY THAT'S FOUNDED BY PETER DIAMANDIS WHO IS HERE IN THE AUDIENCE AND MYSELF IT'S BACKED BY NASA
RayKurzweil_2009U@402.80:411.99 AND GOOGLE AND OTHER LEADERS IN THE HIGH TECH AND SCIENCE COMMUNITY AND OUR GOAL WAS TO ASSEMBLE THE LEADERS BOTH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS
RayKurzweil_2009U@412.34:423.15 IN THESE EXPONENTIALLY GROWING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND THEIR APPLICATION BUT LARRY PAGE MADE AN IMPASSIONED SPEECH AT OUR ORGANIZING MEETING SAYING WE SHOULD DEVOTE
RayKurzweil_2009U@423.90:433.03 THIS STUDY TO ACTUALLY ADDRESSING SOME OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES FACING HUMANITY AND IF WE DID THAT THEN GOOGLE WOULD BACK THIS AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE
RayKurzweil_2009U@433.63:443.04 THE LAST THIRD OF THE NINE WEEK INTENSIVE SUMMER SESSION WILL BE DEVOTED TO A GROUP PROJECT TO ADDRESS SOME MAJOR CHALLENGE OF HUMANITY LIKE FOR EXAMPLE APPLYING
RayKurzweil_2009U@443.39:455.27 THE INTERNET WHICH IS NOW UBIQUITOUS IN THE RURAL AREAS OF CHINA OR IN AFRICA TO BRINGING HEALTH INFORMATION TO DEVELOPING AREAS OF THE WORLD AND THESE PROJECTS WILL CONTINUE PAST
RayKurzweil_2009U@456.02:469.81 THESE SESSIONS USING COLLABORATIVE INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATION ALL THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT IS CREATED AND TAUGHT WILL BE ONLINE AND AVAILABLE AND DEVELOPED ONLINE IN A COLLABORATIVE FASHION HERE IS OUR FOUNDING MEETING
RayKurzweil_2009U@470.13:481.65 BUT THIS IS BEING ANNOUNCED TODAY IT WILL BE PERMANENTLY HEADQUARTERED IN SILICON VALLEY AT THE NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER THERE ARE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS FOR EXECUTIVES AT DIFFERENT
RayKurzweil_2009U@482.53:489.61 THE FIRST SIX TRACKS HERE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ADVANCED COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES BIOTECHNOLOGY NANOTECHNOLOGY ARE THE DIFFERENT CORE AREAS
RayKurzweil_2009U@489.95:502.61 OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY THEN WE ARE GOING TO APPLY THEM TO THE OTHER AREAS LIKE ENERGY ECOLOGY POLICY LAW AND ETHICS ENTREPRENEURSHIP SO THAT PEOPLE CAN BRING THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO THE WORLD
RayKurzweil_2009U@504.87:516.50 SO WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE SUPPORT WE'VE GOTTEN FROM BOTH THE INTELLECTUAL LEADERS THE HIGH TECH LEADERS PARTICULARLY GOOGLE AND NASA THIS IS AN EXCITING NEW VENTURE AND WE INVITE YOU TO PARTICIPATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
