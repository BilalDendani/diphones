DavidPogue_2008P@16.33:24.45 I'M THE WEEKLY TECH CRITIC FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES I REVIEW GADGETS AND STUFF AND MOSTLY WHAT GOOD DADS SHOULD BE DOING THIS TIME OF YEAR
DavidPogue_2008P@24.83:34.84 IS NESTLING WITH THEIR KIDS AND DECORATING THE CHRISTMAS TREE WHAT I'M MOSTLY DOING THIS YEAR IS GOING ON CABLE TV AND ANSWERING THE SAME QUESTION WHAT ARE THE TECH TRENDS FOR NEXT YEAR
DavidPogue_2008P@35.45:45.50 LIKE DIDN 'T WE JUST GO THROUGH THIS LAST YEAR BUT I'M GOING TO PICK THE ONE THAT INTERESTS ME MOST AND THAT IS THE COMPLETED MARRIAGE OF THE CELL PHONE AND THE INTERNET YOU KNOW I FOUND THAT
DavidPogue_2008P@45.94:51.51 VOLCANO ON GOOGLE IMAGES NOT REALIZING HOW MUCH IT MAKES ME LOOK LIKE THE COVER OF DIANETICS
DavidPogue_2008P@76.13:87.43 BUT ITS JUST A FAKE OUT IT'S A WAV FILE OF A DIAL TONE JUST TO REASSURE YOU THAT THE WORLD HASN'T ENDED IT COULD BE ANYTHING IT COULD BE SALSA MUSIC OR A COMEDY ROUTINE IT DOESN'T MATTER
DavidPogue_2008P@88.65:101.45 THE LITTLE BOX HAS YOUR PHONE NUMBER SO THAT'S REALLY COOL YOU CAN TAKE IT TO LONDON OR SIBERIA AND YOUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR CAN DIAL YOUR HOME NUMBER AND YOUR PHONE WILL RING BECAUSE IT'S GOT EVERYTHING IN THE BOX THEY'VE GOT EVERY FEATURE KNOWN TO MAN IN THERE
DavidPogue_2008P@113.51:123.11 THE LAST THREE YEARS I MEAN NO SELF RESPECTING COLLEGE KID HAS HOME PHONE SERVICE ANYMORE THIS IS WHAT COLLEGE KIDS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE IT'S THE MOST POPULAR VOIP SERVICE IN THE WORLD IT'S SKYPE
DavidPogue_2008P@123.32:133.91 IT'S A FREE PROGRAM YOU DOWNLOAD FOR YOUR MAC OR PC AND YOU MAKE FREE PHONE CALLS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO WEAR A HEADSET LIKE A NERD IT'S NOT YOUR PHONE IT'S YOUR COMPUTER
DavidPogue_2008P@134.96:143.80 BUT NONETHELESS IF YOU'RE A COLLEGE KID AND YOU HAVE NO MONEY BELIEVE ME THIS IS BETTER THAN TRYING TO USE YOUR CELLPHONE IT'S REALLY CUTE SEEING MIDDLE AGED PEOPLE LIKE ME
DavidPogue_2008P@144.09:150.96 TRY OUT SKYPE FOR THE FIRST TIME WHICH IS USUALLY WHEN THEIR KID GOES AWAY FOR A SEMESTER ABROAD THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY THE INTERNATIONAL FEES
DavidPogue_2008P@153.21:153.82 IS THAT YOU
DavidPogue_2008P@154.21:156.07 IT'S REALLY CUTE
DavidPogue_2008P@158.43:170.16 BUT I AT LEAST IT WAS WHEN I DID IT I THINK WHERE VOIP IS REALLY GOING TO GET INTERESTING IS WHEN THEY START PUTTING IT ON CELLPHONES IMAGINE IF YOU HAD AN ORDINARY CELLPHONE AND ANY TIME YOU WERE IN A WIRELESS HOTSPOT
DavidPogue_2008P@170.54:179.52 FREE CALLS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD NEVER PAY THE CELLULAR COMPANY A NICKLE IT 'D BE REALLY REALLY COOL AND YET EVEN THOUGH THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THIS HAS BEEN AVAILABLE
DavidPogue_2008P@179.77:187.71 FOR FIVE YEARS INCREDIBLY THE NUMBER OF STANDARD CELLPHONES OFFERED BY US CARRIERS WITH FREE VOIP
DavidPogue_2008P@189.18:189.76 ZERO
DavidPogue_2008P@190.44:192.24 I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY
DavidPogue_2008P@203.05:212.35 I AM NOT PAID BY T MOBILE I'M NOT PLUGGING T MOBILE THE NEW YORK TIMES HAS VERY RIGID POLICIES ABOUT THAT EVER SINCE THAT JAYSON BLAIR JERK RUINED IT FOR ALL OF US
DavidPogue_2008P@214.04:223.67 BASICALLY THE REASON YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IS BECAUSE IT WAS INTRODUCED LAST YEAR ON JUNE TWENTY NINE DOES ANYONE REMEMBER WHAT ELSE HAPPENED ON JUNE TWENTY NINE LAST YEAR
DavidPogue_2008P@223.99:231.74 IT WAS THE IPHONE THE IPHONE CAME OUT THAT DAY I'M LIKE CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING THE T MOBILE PR LADY YOU KNOW HI WE
DavidPogue_2008P@238.72:239.20 BUT
DavidPogue_2008P@254.41:263.14 AND WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF THE HOTSPOT YOU'RE ON THE REGULAR CELLULAR NETWORK YOUR 'E THINKING WELL HOW OFTEN AM I IN A HOTSPOT THE ANSWER IS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY GIVE YOU
DavidPogue_2008P@276.18:284.36 IT'S A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO PUT UP ONE OF THOSE TOWERS RIGHT THEY DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY INSTEAD THEY GIVE EACH OF US A SEVEN DOLLAR AND NINETY FIVE CENT BOX
DavidPogue_2008P@285.07:293.73 LIKE A STEALTH TOWER INSTALLATION PROGRAM WE'RE PUTTING IT IN OUR HOMES FOR THEM ANYWAY THEY HAVE WI FI PHONES IN EUROPE
DavidPogue_2008P@294.09:304.51 BUT THE THING THAT T MOBILE DID THAT NOBODY 'S DONE BEFORE IS WHEN YOU'RE ON A CALL AN YOU MOVE FROM WI FI INTO CELLULAR RANGE THE CALL IS HANDED OFF IN MID SYLLABLE SEAMLESSLY
DavidPogue_2008P@305.13:313.00 I'LL SHOW YOU THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES WE USE AT THE NEW YORK TIMES TO TEST THIS GEAR THIS IS ME WITH A CAMCORDER ON A PHONE GOING LIKE THIS
DavidPogue_2008P@314.10:322.80 AS I WALK OUT OF THE HOUSE FROM MY WI FI HOTSPOT INTO THE CELLULAR NETWORK ON A CALL WITH MY WIFE LOOK AT THE UPPER LEFT THAT'S THE WI FI SIGNAL
DavidPogue_2008P@330.17:330.36 SOUND
DavidPogue_2008P@340.05:341.58 DOING RIGHT
DavidPogue_2008P@353.04:361.95 THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE BOUNDARIES BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET PLUS CELLPHONE ARE MELTING THE COOL THING ABOUT THE T MOBILE PHONES IS THAT ALTHOUGH SWITCHING TECHNOLOGIES IS VERY ADVANCED
DavidPogue_2008P@376.09:377.02 AND
DavidPogue_2008P@378.27:385.27 THE CALL WILL CONTINUE TO BE FREE BECAUSE THEY DON 'T THEY HAVEN'T WELL NO WAIT NOT SO FAST IT ALSO WORKS THE OTHER WAY
DavidPogue_2008P@386.14:396.05 IF YOU START A CALL ON YOUR CELLULAR NETWORK AND YOU COME HOME YOU KEEP BEING BILLED WHICH IS WHY MOST PEOPLE WITH THIS SERVICE GET INTO THE HABIT OF SAYING HEY I JUST GOT HOME CAN I CALL YOU RIGHT BACK
DavidPogue_2008P@396.76:404.15 NOW YOU GET IT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT IF YOU USE ONE OF THESE PHONES OVERSEAS IT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT INTERNET HOTSPOT
DavidPogue_2008P@404.94:411.68 ON THE INTERNET NOBODY KNOWS YOU'RE A DOG RIGHT NOBODY KNOWS YOU'RE IN PAKISTAN YOU CAN MAKE FREE UNLIMITED CALLS HOME TO THE
DavidPogue_2008P@434.93:437.10 I HAVE TWO CELLPHONES SO THIS GOING TO BE VERY ODD
DavidPogue_2008P@473.83:474.78 MADE THE POINT

DavidPogue_2008P@487.63:492.23 I HAVE YOUR NUMBERS NOW YOU WILL PAY
DavidPogue_2008P@494.43:506.40 IS THIS REALLY BRILLIANT IDEA WHERE THEY GIVE YOU A NEW PHONE NUMBER AND THEN AT THAT POINT ONE PHONE NUMBER RINGS ALL YOUR PHONES AT ONCE YOUR HOME PHONE YOUR WORK PHONE YOUR CELLPHONE YOUR YACHT PHONE THIS IS THE EG
DavidPogue_2008P@519.01:526.01 YOU CAN SAY I WANT THESE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO CALL ME ONLY DURING THESE HOURS AND I WANT THESE PEOPLE TO HEAR THIS GREETING
DavidPogue_2008P@526.53:534.60 HI BOSS I'M OUT MAKING US BOTH SOME MONEY LEAVE A MESSAGE AND THEN YOUR WIFE CALLS AND HI HONEY LEAVE ME A MESSAGE VERY CUSTOMIZABLE
DavidPogue_2008P@535.09:544.96 GOOGLE BOUGHT IT AND THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR A YEAR THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO COME OUT WITH IT VERY SHORTLY IN A PUBLIC METHOD BY THE WAY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY BOTHERS ME
DavidPogue_2008P@556.41:565.64 I'M GOING TO TELL YOU HOW TO AVOID THAT NOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE IS GOOGLE CELLULAR IT'S TOTALLY FREE THERE'S NOT EVEN ADS IF YOU KNOW HOW TO SEND A TEXT MESSAGE YOU CAN GET THE SAME INFORMATION FOR

DavidPogue_2008P@608.04:608.71 WHY I WAS IN
DavidPogue_2008P@610.91:617.43 AND THOSE ARE JUST THE BEGINNING THESE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU CAN TEXT TO GOOGLE AND THEY WILL YEAH YOU'RE ALL TRYING TO WRITE THIS

DavidPogue_2008P@778.57:784.47 WHO ARE BEING PAID TWENTY CENTS PER ANSWER AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT'S COLLEGE KIDS AND OLD PEOPLE
DavidPogue_2008P@785.30:795.71 THAT'S WHO CAN AFFORD TO DO THAT BUT IT'S A HUMAN BEING ON THE LINE AND IT'S GOTTEN ME OUT OF SO MANY TOUGH POSITIONS LIKE WHEN 'S THE LAST FLIGHT OUT OF CHICAGO YOU KNOW IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
DavidPogue_2008P@797.02:804.35 ANOTHER THING THAT REALLY BOTHERS ME ABOUT CELLPHONES TODAY THIS IS PROBABLY MY BIGGEST PET PEEVE IN ALL OF TECHNOLOGY WHEN I
DavidPogue_2008P@804.61:806.20 CALL TO LEAVE YOU A MESSAGE
DavidPogue_2008P@807.56:814.59 I GET FIFTEEN SECONDS OF INSTRUCTIONS FROM A THIRD GRADE TEACHER ON AMBIEN

DavidPogue_2008P@1144.20:1156.73 I THINK THE BIGGEST CHANGE WHEN INTERNET MET PHONE WAS WITH THE IPHONE NOT MY FINEST MOMENT IN NEW YORK TIMES JOURNALISM IT WAS WHEN IN THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND AND SIX I EXPLAINED WHY APPLE WOULD NEVER DO A CELLPHONE
DavidPogue_2008P@1157.60:1164.42 I LOOKED LIKE A MORON HOWEVER MY LOGIC WAS GOOD BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REALIZE THIS BUT UNTIL THE IPHONE CAME ALONG THE
DavidPogue_2008P@1207.05:1217.05 YOU CAN SEE WHAT I SAID ABOUT IT IT'S A FLAWED MASTERPIECE IT'S GOT BAD THINGS AND GOOD THINGS LETS ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT RIGHT NOW BUT IT DID CHANGE A FEW THINGS THE FIRST THING IT CHANGED WAS THAT
DavidPogue_2008P@1217.22:1226.53 ALL THOSE CARRIERS SAW THAT THEY SOLD TEN MILLION OF THESE THINGS IN A YEAR AND THEY SAID OH MY GOSH MAYBE WE'VE BEEN DOING IT WRONG MAYBE WE SHOULD LET PHONE DESIGNERS DESIGN THE PHONES
DavidPogue_2008P@1231.40:1241.45 ANOTHER THING WAS THAT IT LET TEN MILLION PEOPLE FOR THE FIRST TIME EXPERIENCE BEING ONLINE ALL THE TIME NOT USING THESE SIXTY DOLLAR A MONTH CELLULAR CARDS FOR THEIR LAPTOPS
DavidPogue_2008P@1250.45:1250.74 A
