AlGore_2008 I HAVE GIVEN
AlGore_2008 THE SLIDE SHOW THAT I GAVE HERE TWO YEARS AGO ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TIMES I'M GIVING A SHORT SLIDE SHOW THIS MORNING THAT I'M GIVING FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
AlGore_2008 ON OUR HOUSE AND DUG THE GEOTHERMAL WELLS AND DID ALL OF THAT
AlGore_2008 OTHER STUFF
AlGore_2008 BUT AS IMPORTANT AS IT IS TO CHANGE THE LIGHT BULBS IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO CHANGE THE LAWS AND WHEN WE
AlGore_2008 IN ORDER
AlGore_2008 TO BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THIS WE HAVE TO BECOME INCREDIBLY ACTIVE AS CITIZENS IN OUR DEMOCRACY IN
AlGore_2008 MANY YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A YOUNG CONGRESSMAN I SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME DEALING WITH THE CHALLENGE OF NUCLEAR ARMS CONTROL THE NUCLEAR ARMS RACE AND THE MILITARY HISTORIANS TAUGHT ME DURING THAT QUEST
AlGore_2008 THAT MILITARY CONFLICTS ARE TYPICALLY
AlGore_2008 PUT INTO THREE CATEGORIES
AlGore_2008 LOCAL BATTLES
AlGore_2008 REGIONAL OR THEATER WARS
AlGore_2008 AND THE RARE BUT ALL IMPORTANT GLOBAL WORLD WAR
AlGore_2008 A DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES FALL INTO THE SAME THREE CATEGORIES AND MOST OF WHAT WE THINK ABOUT ARE LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS AIR POLLUTION WATER POLLUTION HAZARDOUS WASTE DUMPS
AlGore_2008 BUT THERE ARE ALSO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS LIKE ACID RAIN FROM THE MIDWEST TO THE NORTHEAST AND FROM WESTERN EUROPE TO THE ARCTIC AND
AlGore_2008 NOT BECAUSE VENUS IS SLIGHTLY CLOSER TO THE SUN IT'S THREE TIMES HOTTER THAN MERCURY WHICH IS RIGHT NEXT TO THE
AlGore_2008 YOU'VE SEEN THIS SLIDE BEFORE BUT THERE'S A CHANGE
AlGore_2008 THE ONLY TWO COUNTRIES THAT DIDN'T RATIFY AND NOW THERE'S ONLY ONE
AlGore_2008 HEARD A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO
AlGore_2008 ABOUT THE VALUE OF
AlGore_2008 HAVE TO SOMEHOW UNDERSTAND
AlGore_2008 THAT HISTORY HAS PRESENTED US WITH A CHOICE
AlGore_2008 FIGURING OUT HOW TO SAVE HER LIFE
AlGore_2008 WHILE SHE WAS DISTRACTED
AlGore_2008 BY THE AMAZING EXPERIENCE THAT SHE WAS GOING THROUGH
AlGore_2008 WE NOW HAVE A CULTURE OF DISTRACTION
AlGore_2008 BUT WE HAVE A PLANETARY EMERGENCY
AlGore_2008 AND WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY
AlGore_2008 TO CREATE IN THE GENERATION OF THOSE ALIVE TODAY A SENSE OF GENERATIONAL MISSION I WISH I COULD FIND THE WORDS TO CONVEY THIS
AlGore_2008 THIS WAS ANOTHER HERO GENERATION
AlGore_2008 THAT BROUGHT DEMOCRACY TO THE PLANET
AlGore_2008 ANOTHER THAT ENDED SLAVERY
AlGore_2008 WE CAN DO THIS
AlGore_2008 HAVE THE CAPACITY
AlGore_2008 AT MOMENTS OF GREAT CHALLENGE
AlGore_2008 TO SET ASIDE THE CAUSES OF DISTRACTION AND RISE TO THE CHALLENGE THAT HISTORY IS PRESENTING TO US
AlGore_2008 SOMETIMES I HEAR PEOPLE
AlGore_2008 BY SAYING OH THIS IS SO TERRIBLE
AlGore_2008 WHAT A BURDEN WE HAVE
AlGore_2008 I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU TO RE FRAME THAT
AlGore_2008 HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
AlGore_2008 TO RISE TO A CHALLENGE
AlGore_2008 THAT IS WORTHY OF OUR BEST EFFORTS
AlGore_2008 CHALLENGE THAT CAN PULL FROM US
AlGore_2008 MORE THAN WE KNEW WE COULD DO
AlGore_2008 I THINK WE OUGHT TO APPROACH THIS CHALLENGE WITH A SENSE OF PROFOUND JOY AND GRATITUDE
AlGore_2008 THAT WE ARE THE GENERATION
AlGore_2008 ABOUT WHICH A THOUSAND YEARS FROM NOW
AlGore_2008 AND POETS AND SINGERS
AlGore_2008 WILL CELEBRATE BY SAYING THEY WERE THE ONES
AlGore_2008 SO MANY PEOPLE AT TED THERE IS DEEP PAIN THAT BASICALLY A DESIGN ISSUE AT THE END OF THE DAY A DESIGN ISSUE ON A VOTING FORM
AlGore_2008 ONE BAD DESIGN ISSUE MEANT THAT YOUR VOICE WASN'T BEING HEARD LIKE THAT IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS IN A POSITION WHERE YOU COULD MAKE THESE THINGS COME TRUE
AlGore_2008 YOU HAVE NO IDEA
AlGore_2008 WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE LEADING CANDIDATES IN YOUR OWN PARTY ARE DOING NOW I MEAN
AlGore_2008 ARE YOU EXCITED BY THEIR PLANS ON GLOBAL
AlGore_2008 THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS HARD FOR ME BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD FEEL
AlGore_2008 REALLY GREAT ABOUT THE FACT
AlGore_2008 THAT THE
AlGore_2008 AND FORWARD LEANING POSITION ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS ALL THREE HAVE OFFERED LEADERSHIP AND ALL THREE ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE APPROACH TAKEN BY THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION
AlGore_2008 AND I THINK THAT ALL THREE HAVE ALSO BEEN RESPONSIBLE IN PUTTING FORWARD PLANS AND PROPOSALS
AlGore_2008 THE
AlGore_2008 CAMPAIGN DIALOGUE THAT AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS PUT TOGETHER BY THE LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS BY THE WAY THE ANALYSIS OF ALL THE QUESTIONS
AlGore_2008 AND BY THE WAY THE DEBATES HAVE ALL BEEN SPONSORED BY SOMETHING THAT GOES BY THE ORWELLIAN LABEL CLEAN COAL
AlGore_2008 EVERY SINGLE DEBATE HAS BEEN SPONSORED BY CLEAN COAL NOW EVEN LOWER EMISSIONS
AlGore_2008 THE RICHNESS AND FULLNESS OF THE DIALOGUE IN OUR DEMOCRACY HAS NOT LAID THE BASIS FOR THE KIND OF BOLD
AlGore_2008 THAT IS REALLY NEEDED SO THEY'RE SAYING THE RIGHT THINGS AND THEY MAY WHICHEVER OF THEM IS ELECTED MAY DO THE RIGHT THING BUT LET ME TELL YOU
AlGore_2008 ONLY ONE OUT OF ONE HUNDRED SENATORS WAS WILLING TO VOTE TO CONFIRM
AlGore_2008 TO RATIFY THAT TREATY
AlGore_2008 WHATEVER THE CANDIDATES SAY
AlGore_2008 HAS TO BE LAID ALONGSIDE WHAT THE PEOPLE SAY
AlGore_2008 THIS CHALLENGE IS PART OF THE FABRIC OF OUR WHOLE CIVILIZATION CO TWO IS THE EXHALING BREATH OF OUR CIVILIZATION LITERALLY
AlGore_2008 AND NOW WE MECHANIZED THAT PROCESS CHANGING THAT PATTERN REQUIRES A SCOPE
AlGore_2008 A SCALE A SPEED OF CHANGE THAT IS BEYOND WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST SO THAT'S WHY I BEGAN BY SAYING
AlGore_2008 BE OPTIMISTIC IN WHAT YOU DO BUT BE AN ACTIVE CITIZEN DEMAND CHANGE THE LIGHT BULBS BUT CHANGE THE LAWS
AlGore_2008 CHANGE THE GLOBAL TREATIES WE HAVE TO SPEAK UP WE HAVE TO SOLVE THIS DEMOCRACY
AlGore_2008 THIS WE HAVE SCLEROSIS IN OUR DEMOCRACY AND WE HAVE TO CHANGE THAT USE THE INTERNET GO ON THE INTERNET
AlGore_2008 CONNECT WITH PEOPLE BECOME VERY ACTIVE AS CITIZENS HAVE A MORATORIUM WE SHOULDN 'T HAVE ANY NEW
AlGore_2008 WE HAVE TO QUICKLY BUILD THESE RENEWABLE SOURCES NOW NOBODY IS TALKING ON THAT SCALE BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER IT IS POSSIBLE THIS ALLIANCE FOR CLIMATE PROTECTION
AlGore_2008 LAUNCH A NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN GRASSROOTS MOBILIZATION TELEVISION ADS INTERNET ADS RADIO NEWSPAPER WITH PARTNERSHIPS WITH EVERYBODY FROM THE GIRL SCOUTS TO THE HUNTERS AND FISHERMEN
AlGore_2008 WE NEED HELP
AlGore_2008 YOUR OWN PERSONAL ROLE GOING FORWARD AL IS THERE SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE DOING
AlGore_2008 I HAVE PRAYED THAT
AlGore_2008 WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND THE ANSWER
AlGore_2008 IT DOES DEPEND ON ALL OF US BUT AGAIN NOT JUST WITH THE LIGHT BULBS
AlGore_2008 MOST OF US HERE
AlGore_2008 ARE AMERICANS
AlGore_2008 WE HAVE A DEMOCRACY
AlGore_2008 WE CAN CHANGE THINGS BUT WE HAVE TO ACTIVELY CHANGE
AlGore_2008 WHAT'S NEEDED REALLY IS
AlGore_2008 A HIGHER LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS
AlGore_2008 AND THAT'S HARD TO THAT'S HARD TO CREATE BUT IT IS COMING
AlGore_2008 IF YOU WANT TO GO FAR GO TOGETHER
