NickVeasey_2009G IT SEEMS A BIT EXTREME TO ME THAT IMAGE WAS THE START OF THE X RAY TECHNOLOGY AND I'M STILL FUNDAMENTALLY USING THE SAME PRINCIPLES
NickVeasey_2009G IN A MORE
NickVeasey_2009G IT SHOWS ALL THE DETRITUS THAT'S SORT OF EMBEDDED IN THE SOLE OF THE SNEAKERS IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE POT LUCK THINGS WHERE YOU GET IT RIGHT FIRST TIME
NickVeasey_2009G MOVING ON TO SOMETHING A BIT LARGER THIS IS AN X RAY OF A BUS AND THE BUS IS FULL OF PEOPLE IT'S ACTUALLY THE SAME PERSON IT'S JUST ONE SKELETON AND BACK IN THE SIXTIES THEY USED TO TEACH STUDENT RADIOGRAPHERS TO TAKE X RAYS THANKFULLY NOT ON YOU AND I
NickVeasey_2009G ON DEAD PEOPLE SO I'VE STILL GOT ACCESS TO ONE OF THESE DEAD PEOPLE CALLED FRIEDA SHE'S FALLING APART I'M AFRAID BECAUSE SHE'S VERY OLD AND FRAGILE
NickVeasey_2009G BUT EVERYONE ON THAT BUS IS FRIEDA AND THE BUS IS TAKEN WITH A CARGO SCANNING X RAY WHICH IS THE SORT OF MACHINE YOU HAVE ON BORDERS WHICH CHECKS FOR CONTRABAND AND DRUGS AND BOMBS AND THINGS
NickVeasey_2009G THESE LARGE CARGO SCANNER X RAYS THAT WORK WITH THE DIGITAL SYSTEM ARE GETTING BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER AGAIN THOUGH TO MAKE IT COME ALIVE YOU NEED SOMEHOW TO ADD THE HUMAN ELEMENT AND I THINK THE REASON THIS IMAGE WORKS AGAIN IS BECAUSE FRIEDA IS DRIVING
NickVeasey_2009G QUITE A DIFFICULT BRIEF MAKE A PAIR OF MEN 'S PANTS LOOK BEAUTIFUL BUT I THINK THE PROCESS IN ITSELF SHOWS
NickVeasey_2009G FASHION NOW I'M SORT OF ANTI FASHION BECAUSE I DON'T SHOW THE SURFACE I SHOW WHAT'S WITHIN SO THE FASHIONISTAS DON'T REALLY LIKE ME BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER IF KATE MOSS IS WEARING IT OR IF I'M WEARING IT
NickVeasey_2009G WE ALL LOOK THE SAME INSIDE BELIEVE ME THE CREASES IN THE MATERIAL AND THE SORT OF NUANCES AND I SHOW THINGS FOR REALLY WHAT THEY ARE WHAT THEY'RE MADE OF I PEEL BACK THE LAYERS AND EXPOSE IT
NickVeasey_2009G WELL MADE I SHOW IT IF IT'S BADLY MADE I SHOW IT AND I'M SURE ROSS CAN ASSOCIATE THAT WITH DESIGN THE DESIGN COMES FROM WITHIN IT'S NOT JUST
NickVeasey_2009G ONCE THE BONES HAD FUSED TOGETHER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
NickVeasey_2009G SO THAT'S AN EMPTY PARKA JACKET BUT I QUITE LOVE THE WAY IT'S POSED NATURE IS MY GREATEST INSPIRATION AND TO CARRY ON WITH A THEME THAT WE'VE ALREADY TOUCHED WITH
NickVeasey_2009G BY WHAT SURROUNDS US BY NATURE THIS IN FACT IS A VICTORIA WATER LILY LEAF THAT FLOATS ON THE TOP OF A POND AN AMARYLLIS FLOWER LOOKING REALLY THREE DIMENSIONAL
NickVeasey_2009G THE DOOR TO MY X RAY ROOM IS MADE OF LEAD AND STEEL IT WEIGHS ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY KILOGRAMS AND THE ONLY EXERCISE I GET
NickVeasey_2009G THE WALLS ARE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLIMETERS THICK OF SOLID DENSE CONCRETE SO I'M USING QUITE A LOT OF RADIATION A LOT MORE THAN YOU'D GET IN A HOSPITAL OR
NickVeasey_2009G THAT TECHNOLOGY IS USED FOR LOOKING FOR CANCER OR LOOKING FOR DRUGS OR LOOKING FOR CONTRABAND OR WHATEVER AND I USE THAT SORT OF TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE THINGS
NickVeasey_2009G HAVE TO USE A NINETEEN EIGHTIES DRUM SCANNER WHICH WAS DESIGNED IN THE DAYS WHEN EVERYONE SHOT PHOTOGRAPHS ON FILM THEY SCAN EACH
NickVeasey_2009G SO WHEN YOU MOVE FORWARD FROM SOMETHING FAIRLY SMALL A DRESS WHICH IS THIS SIZE ONTO SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH IS DONE IN EXACTLY THE SAME PROCESS YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT IS A LOT OF WORK
NickVeasey_2009G FRIEDA IS MY DEAD SKELETON THIS UNFORTUNATELY IS BASICALLY TWO PICTURES ONE ON THE EXTREME RIGHT IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF AN AMERICAN FOOTBALLER THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS AN X RAY
NickVeasey_2009G BUT THIS TIME I HAD TO USE A REAL BODY BECAUSE I NEEDED ALL THE SKIN TISSUE TO MAKE IT LOOK REAL TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT WAS A REAL ATHLETE SO HERE I HAD TO USE A RECENTLY DECEASED BODY AND
NickVeasey_2009G WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND LABORIOUS BUT PEOPLE DO DONATE THEIR BODIES TO ART AND SCIENCE AND WHEN THEY DO I'M IN THE QUEUE SO I LIKE TO USE THEM
NickVeasey_2009G FLOWER DOESN'T COME IN BRIGHT ORANGE I DON'T THINK BUT I JUST LIKE IT IN BRIGHT ORANGE AND ALSO WITH SOMETHING TECHNICAL LIKE THESE ARE DJ DECKS IT SORT OF ADDS ANOTHER
NickVeasey_2009G HAS HUMAN CONNOTATIONS THE FACT THAT IT'S A CHILD 'S TOY THAT WE ALL RECOGNIZE
NickVeasey_2009G IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S
NickVeasey_2009G THE BUS WAS DONE WITH A CARGO SCANNING X RAY MACHINE WHICH IS USED ON THE BORDERS BETWEEN COUNTRIES LOOKING FOR CONTRABAND AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THE LORRY GOES IN FRONT OF IT AND IT TAKES SLICES
NickVeasey_2009G OF X RAYS THROUGH THE LORRY AND THAT'S HOW THIS WAS DONE IT'S ACTUALLY SLICE SLICE IT'S A BIT LIKE A CT SCANNER IN A HOSPITAL
NickVeasey_2009G SO THESE LITTLE DETAILS
NickVeasey_2009G TO MAKE IT WORK MAKE IT REAL
NickVeasey_2009G THE PROBLEM WITH USING LIVING PEOPLE IS THAT TO TAKE AN X RAY IF I X RAY YOU
NickVeasey_2009G THAT'S A VARIETY OF THINGS FROM RECENTLY DECEASED BODIES TO A SKELETON THAT WAS USED BY STUDENT RADIOGRAPHERS TO TRAIN IN TAKING X RAYS OF THE HUMAN BODY AT DIFFERENT DENSITIES
NickVeasey_2009G VERY HIGH TECH EQUIPMENT OF GLOVES SCISSORS AND A
NickVeasey_2009G I WILL SHOW
NickVeasey_2009G TO GET ALL THE CELLS INSIDE THAT STEM BECAUSE IT TRANSFERS
NickVeasey_2009G THE X RAY SHOWS HOW BEAUTIFUL NATURE CAN BE NOT THAT THAT IS PARTICULARLY BEAUTIFUL WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT WITH THE HUMAN
NickVeasey_2009G THE WAY THE LEAVES FORM THEY'RE CURLING BACK ON EACH OTHER
NickVeasey_2009G SO THE X RAY WILL SHOW THE OVERLAPS IN THESE LITTLE CORNERS
NickVeasey_2009G THE OBJECT THE MORE RADIATION IT NEEDS AND THE MORE TIME
NickVeasey_2009G I COULD GET A BIT DARKER IN THE TUBE BUT EVERYTHING ELSE WOULD SUFFER SO THESE LEAVES AT THE EDGE WOULD START TO DISAPPEAR WHAT I LIKE IS HOW HARD THE
NickVeasey_2009G FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH FOR WHAT IT'S REALLY MADE OF HOW IT REALLY WORKS BUT ALSO I FIND THAT
NickVeasey_2009G WHICH IS THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE USED TO
NickVeasey_2009G NOT FAR OFF SO WHAT AM I DOING IN THE FUTURE WELL THIS YEAR IS THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF ISSIGONIS MINI WHICH IS ONE OF MY
NickVeasey_2009G MUSEUM AS A LIGHT BOX WHICH IS ACTUALLY ATTACHED TO THE CAR SO I'VE GOT TO SAW THE CAR IN HALF DOWN THE MIDDLE NOT AN EASY TASK IN ITSELF AND THEN SO YOU CAN GET IN THE DRIVER 'S SIDE SIT DOWN
NickVeasey_2009G AND APPLY IT TO OTHER SORT OF ICONIC THINGS FROM MY LIFE LIKE MY FIRST COMPUTER WAS A BIG MOVEMENT IN MY LIFE AND I HAD A MAC CLASSIC AND IT'S A LITTLE BOX
NickVeasey_2009G DOING IT I'M ALSO WORKING NOW WITH X RAY VIDEO SO IF YOU CAN IMAGINE SOME OF THESE FLOWERS AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY MOVING AND GROWING AND YOU CAN FILM THAT IN X RAY SHOULD BE QUITE STUNNING BUT THAT'S IT I'M DONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
