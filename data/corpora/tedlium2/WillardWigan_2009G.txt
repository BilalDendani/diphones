WillardWigan_2009G@15.13:27.32 SOMETHING DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT THERE MY WORK IS IT'S A REFLECTION OF MYSELF WHAT I WANTED TO DO IS TO
WillardWigan_2009G@29.19:36.98 SHOW THE WORLD THAT THE LITTLE THINGS CAN BE THE BIGGEST THINGS
WillardWigan_2009G@38.56:48.34 WE ALL SEEM TO THINK THAT YOU KNOW IF WE LOOK DOWN ON THE GROUND THERE'S NOTHING THERE AND WE USE THE WORD NOTHING
WillardWigan_2009G@49.41:55.62 NOTHING DOESN'T EXIST BECAUSE THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING MY MOTHER TOLD ME THAT WHEN I WAS A CHILD
WillardWigan_2009G@55.99:63.26 THAT I SHOULD ALWAYS RESPECT THE LITTLE THINGS WHAT MADE ME DO THIS WORK I SHALL GO INTO MY STORY
WillardWigan_2009G@70.25:72.78 THIS ALL STARTED WHEN I WAS AGE FIVE
WillardWigan_2009G@73.89:81.61 WHAT MADE ME DO IT AT SCHOOL I WILL ADMIT THIS ACADEMICALLY I COULDN'T EXPRESS MYSELF SO I WAS
WillardWigan_2009G@81.89:89.60 MORE OR LESS CLASSED AS NOTHING MY WORLD WAS SEEN AS LESS
WillardWigan_2009G@90.35:103.19 SO I DECIDED I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT WORLD I THOUGHT I NEED TO RETREAT INTO SOMETHING ELSE SO WHEN MY MOTHER USED TO TAKE ME TO SCHOOL
WillardWigan_2009G@104.08:116.18 SHE THOUGHT I WAS AT SCHOOL AND I USED TO DO A U TURN WHEN HER BACK WAS TURNED AND RUN OFF AND HIDE IN THE SHED AT THE BACK OF THE GARDEN NOW THE ONE TIME I WAS IN THE SHED AND
WillardWigan_2009G@117.38:127.55 MY MOTHER SUSPECTED SOMETHING THINKING I WAS AT SCHOOL MY MOTHER WAS LIKE THE WOMAN IN TOM AND JERRY SO YOU'D JUST SEE
WillardWigan_2009G@133.76:137.45 SO I WAS HIDING IN THE SHED LIKE THAT AND
WillardWigan_2009G@142.68:150.18 AND THEN I SAW HER LEGS AND THEN SHE SAID GRABBED ME LIKE THAT BECAUSE MY MOTHER WAS QUITE BIG AND SHE LIFTED ME
WillardWigan_2009G@153.15:163.29 SCHOOL I TOLD HER I COULDN'T FACE IT BECAUSE THE WAY THE TEACHER WAS TREATING ME RIDICULING ME AND USING ME AS AN EXAMPLE OF
WillardWigan_2009G@165.68:175.77 AT THAT AGE OBVIOUSLY I COULDN'T EXPRESS IT THAT WAY BUT I TOLD HER I DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT AND THEN SHE SAID YOU 'RE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL TOMORROW AND WALKED OFF AND I DIDN'T EXPECT
WillardWigan_2009G@175.93:183.87 THAT BECAUSE I EXPECTED ONE OF THESE BUT I DIDN'T GET IT SO I'M SITTING THERE THINKING
WillardWigan_2009G@184.74:195.93 AND AS I LOOKED DOWN ON THE GROUND I NOTICED THERE WAS SOME ANTS RUNNING AROUND AND I WENT INTO THIS LITTLE FANTASY WORLD AND I THOUGHT
WillardWigan_2009G@199.06:207.53 LOOKING FOR THE QUEEN ANT OR DO THEY NEED SOMEWHERE TO LIVE SO I THOUGHT PERHAPS IF I MADE THESE ANTS SOME APARTMENTS
WillardWigan_2009G@216.98:229.97 SO I DID AND HOW I SET ABOUT THAT I GOT SOME SPLINTERS OF WOOD AND I SLICED THE LITTLE SPLINTERS OF WOOD WITH A BROKEN SHARD OF GLASS CONSTRUCTED THIS LITTLE APARTMENT WELL IT
WillardWigan_2009G@231.18:237.18 LITTLE SHANTY SHED WHEN I'D FINISHED BUT I THOUGHT PERHAPS THE ANT WON 'T KNOW IT'LL PROBABLY MOVE IN AND SO
WillardWigan_2009G@238.18:248.91 A BIT CRUDE AT THE TIME AND I MADE ALL THESE LITTLE APARTMENTS AND LITTLE MERRY GO ROUNDS SEESAWS AND SWINGS LITTLE LADDERS AND I ENCOURAGED THE ANTS TO COME ROUND BY PUTTING SUGAR AND THINGS LIKE THAT
WillardWigan_2009G@249.74:251.43 AND THEN I SAT DOWN AND ALL THE ANTS
WillardWigan_2009G@252.40:256.98 CAME ALONG AND ALL I COULD HEAR WAS
WillardWigan_2009G@274.77:275.02 THIS

WillardWigan_2009G@357.77:358.10 I SAYS
WillardWigan_2009G@363.70:367.45 AND THEN HE SAID BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN DO
WillardWigan_2009G@386.82:392.42 OF GLASS WHICH AS YOU CAN SEE THAT'S THE ACTUAL FRAME OF
WillardWigan_2009G@409.20:409.38 I
WillardWigan_2009G@438.26:440.30 I DON'T INHALE MY
WillardWigan_2009G@459.56:460.63 OF GLASS AND I HAD TO
