WillardWigan_2009G SOMETHING DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT THERE MY WORK IS IT'S A REFLECTION OF MYSELF WHAT I WANTED TO DO IS TO
WillardWigan_2009G SHOW THE WORLD THAT THE LITTLE THINGS CAN BE THE BIGGEST THINGS
WillardWigan_2009G WE ALL SEEM TO THINK THAT YOU KNOW IF WE LOOK DOWN ON THE GROUND THERE'S NOTHING THERE AND WE USE THE WORD NOTHING
WillardWigan_2009G NOTHING DOESN'T EXIST BECAUSE THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING MY MOTHER TOLD ME THAT WHEN I WAS A CHILD
WillardWigan_2009G THAT I SHOULD ALWAYS RESPECT THE LITTLE THINGS WHAT MADE ME DO THIS WORK I SHALL GO INTO MY STORY
WillardWigan_2009G THIS ALL STARTED WHEN I WAS AGE FIVE
WillardWigan_2009G WHAT MADE ME DO IT AT SCHOOL I WILL ADMIT THIS ACADEMICALLY I COULDN'T EXPRESS MYSELF SO I WAS
WillardWigan_2009G MORE OR LESS CLASSED AS NOTHING MY WORLD WAS SEEN AS LESS
WillardWigan_2009G SO I DECIDED I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT WORLD I THOUGHT I NEED TO RETREAT INTO SOMETHING ELSE SO WHEN MY MOTHER USED TO TAKE ME TO SCHOOL
WillardWigan_2009G SHE THOUGHT I WAS AT SCHOOL AND I USED TO DO A U TURN WHEN HER BACK WAS TURNED AND RUN OFF AND HIDE IN THE SHED AT THE BACK OF THE GARDEN NOW THE ONE TIME I WAS IN THE SHED AND
WillardWigan_2009G MY MOTHER SUSPECTED SOMETHING THINKING I WAS AT SCHOOL MY MOTHER WAS LIKE THE WOMAN IN TOM AND JERRY SO YOU'D JUST SEE
WillardWigan_2009G SO I WAS HIDING IN THE SHED LIKE THAT AND
WillardWigan_2009G AND THEN I SAW HER LEGS AND THEN SHE SAID GRABBED ME LIKE THAT BECAUSE MY MOTHER WAS QUITE BIG AND SHE LIFTED ME
WillardWigan_2009G SCHOOL I TOLD HER I COULDN'T FACE IT BECAUSE THE WAY THE TEACHER WAS TREATING ME RIDICULING ME AND USING ME AS AN EXAMPLE OF
WillardWigan_2009G AT THAT AGE OBVIOUSLY I COULDN'T EXPRESS IT THAT WAY BUT I TOLD HER I DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT AND THEN SHE SAID YOU 'RE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL TOMORROW AND WALKED OFF AND I DIDN'T EXPECT
WillardWigan_2009G THAT BECAUSE I EXPECTED ONE OF THESE BUT I DIDN'T GET IT SO I'M SITTING THERE THINKING
WillardWigan_2009G AND AS I LOOKED DOWN ON THE GROUND I NOTICED THERE WAS SOME ANTS RUNNING AROUND AND I WENT INTO THIS LITTLE FANTASY WORLD AND I THOUGHT
WillardWigan_2009G LOOKING FOR THE QUEEN ANT OR DO THEY NEED SOMEWHERE TO LIVE SO I THOUGHT PERHAPS IF I MADE THESE ANTS SOME APARTMENTS
WillardWigan_2009G SO I DID AND HOW I SET ABOUT THAT I GOT SOME SPLINTERS OF WOOD AND I SLICED THE LITTLE SPLINTERS OF WOOD WITH A BROKEN SHARD OF GLASS CONSTRUCTED THIS LITTLE APARTMENT WELL IT
WillardWigan_2009G LITTLE SHANTY SHED WHEN I'D FINISHED BUT I THOUGHT PERHAPS THE ANT WON 'T KNOW IT'LL PROBABLY MOVE IN AND SO
WillardWigan_2009G A BIT CRUDE AT THE TIME AND I MADE ALL THESE LITTLE APARTMENTS AND LITTLE MERRY GO ROUNDS SEESAWS AND SWINGS LITTLE LADDERS AND I ENCOURAGED THE ANTS TO COME ROUND BY PUTTING SUGAR AND THINGS LIKE THAT
WillardWigan_2009G AND THEN I SAT DOWN AND ALL THE ANTS
WillardWigan_2009G CAME ALONG AND ALL I COULD HEAR WAS
WillardWigan_2009G THIS
WillardWigan_2009G I REALIZED THAT
WillardWigan_2009G TO LIFE THAN JUST EVERYTHING THAT WE SEE AROUND US THAT'S
WillardWigan_2009G I SAYS
WillardWigan_2009G AND THEN HE SAID BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN DO
WillardWigan_2009G OF GLASS WHICH AS YOU CAN SEE THAT'S THE ACTUAL FRAME OF
WillardWigan_2009G I
WillardWigan_2009G I DON'T INHALE MY
WillardWigan_2009G OF GLASS AND I HAD TO
WillardWigan_2009G MY
WillardWigan_2009G AND WHEN I FINISHED IT I
WillardWigan_2009G AND
WillardWigan_2009G THINGS
WillardWigan_2009G TO CARVE HOMER SIMPSON LIKE THAT IN THAT POSITION AND
WillardWigan_2009G TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS ROOM FOR BART'S NECK SO AFTER I'VE DONE THE SAME THING THEN I HAVE TO
WillardWigan_2009G PAINT BRUSH BUT I WOULD NEVER DO IT TO A LIVING FLY BECAUSE I'VE HEARD A FLY
WillardWigan_2009G I WOULD NEVER
WillardWigan_2009G BECAUSE
WillardWigan_2009G AND
WillardWigan_2009G TO
WillardWigan_2009G SIX TO SEVEN WEEKS
WillardWigan_2009G THE WHOLE THING IT'S MADE THE
WillardWigan_2009G OF A
WillardWigan_2009G I
WillardWigan_2009G AND I CUT IT BENT IT ROUND AND
WillardWigan_2009G AND THE SPIDER 'S WEB IS FOR THE REINS ON THE
WillardWigan_2009G A MACHINE THAT ONE TOOK ME
WillardWigan_2009G THE
WillardWigan_2009G SO
