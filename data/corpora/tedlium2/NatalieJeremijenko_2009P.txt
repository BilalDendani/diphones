NatalieJeremijenko_2009P I WAS INFORMED BY THIS KIND OF UNORIGINAL AND TRITE IDEA THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES WERE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION WHICH IS WHAT DROVE ME THEN
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P AND STILL IT'S A DELUSION THAT DRIVES ME NOW I WANTED TO UPDATE WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING SINCE THEN BUT IT'S STILL THE SAME THEME SONG
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P AND INTRODUCE YOU TO MY LAB AND CURRENT WORK WHICH IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CLINIC THAT I RUN AT
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P AND WHAT IT IS IT'S A TWIST ON HEALTH BECAUSE REALLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO NOW IS REDEFINE WHAT COUNTS AS HEALTH IT'S A CLINIC LIKE A HEALTH CLINIC AT ANY OTHER UNIVERSITY
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P EXCEPT PEOPLE COME TO THE CLINIC WITH ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS AND THEY WALK OUT WITH PRESCRIPTIONS FOR THINGS THEY CAN DO TO IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P AS OPPOSED TO COMING TO A CLINIC WITH MEDICAL CONCERNS AND WALKING OUT WITH PRESCRIPTIONS FOR PHARMACEUTICALS
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P IT'S A HANDY DANDY QUOTE FROM HIPPOCRATES OF THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH THAT SAYS THE GREATER PART OF THE SOUL LAYS OUTSIDE THE BODY TREATMENT OF THE INNER REQUIRES TREATMENT OF THE
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P BUT THAT SUGGESTS THE ISSUE THAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT HERE THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REDEFINE WHAT IS HEALTH BECAUSE THIS IDEA THAT HEALTH IS INTERNAL AND ATOMIZED AND INDIVIDUAL
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P AND THE NEW YORK AREA AND LOGGED WHAT THEY SPENT THEIR PATIENT HOURS ON EIGHTY TO NINETY PERCENT OF THEIR TIME WAS SPENT ON FIVE THINGS NUMBER ONE WAS
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P NUMBER FOUR AND FIVE WERE CHILDHOOD OBESITY AND DIABETES RELATED ISSUES SO ALL OF THOSE WHAT'S COMMON ABOUT ALL OF THOSE
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THE ENVIRONMENT IS IMPLICATED RADICALLY IMPLICATED RIGHT THIS IS NOT THE GERMS THAT MEDICOS WERE TRAINED TO DEAL WITH THIS IS A DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF HEALTH
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P HEALTH THAT HAS A GREAT ADVANTAGE BECAUSE IT'S EXTERNAL IT'S SHARED WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AS OPPOSED TO INTERNAL GENETICALLY PREDETERMINED
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P WHERE WE MET IN A ROUNDABOUT PRECISELY BECAUSE THE ROUNDABOUT ICONIFIED THE HEADLESS SOCIAL MOVEMENT THAT INFORMS MUCH SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION AS OPPOSED TO THE TOP DOWN CONTROL OF RED LIGHT
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P MICRO DECISIONS BEING MADE IN SITU BY PEOPLE NOT BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO BUT OF COURSE AFFORDS GREATER THROUGHPUT FEWER ACCIDENTS AND AN INTERESTING MODEL OF SOCIAL MOVEMENT
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P IF YOU WILL WHAT THEY ARE IS AN ADDITION OF TADPOLES THAT ARE NAMED AFTER A LOCAL BUREAUCRAT WHOSE DECISIONS AFFECT YOUR WATER QUALITY SO
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P AN IMPATIENT CONCERN FOR WATER QUALITY WOULD RAISE A TADPOLE BUREAUCRAT IN A SAMPLE OF WATER IN WHICH THEY'RE INTERESTED
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P SENSITIVE THAN SOME OF OUR SENSES FOR SENSING RESPONDING IN A BIOLOGICALLY MEANINGFUL WAY TO THAT WHOLE CLASS OF INDUSTRIAL CONTAMINANTS
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P WE CALL ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS OR HORMONE EMULATORS BUT BY TAKING YOUR TADPOLE OUT FOR A WALK IN THE EVENING THERE'S A FEW ACTION SHOTS YOUR NEIGHBORS ARE LIKELY TO SAY WHAT ARE YOU DOING
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P NEXT TIME YOUR NEIGHBOR SEES YOU THEY'LL SAY HOW IS THAT TADPOLE DOING AND YOU CAN LET THEM SOCIAL NETWORK WITH YOUR TADPOLE BECAUSE THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CLINIC HAS A SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THE TWO AND A HALF YEAR DROP IN THE AVERAGE AGE OF ONSET OF PUBERTY IN YOUNG GIRLS AND OTHER RELATED THINGS THE CULMINATION OF THIS IS IF YOU'VE SUCCESSFULLY RAISED YOUR TADPOLE
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P SEEN ANOTHER QUICK PROTOCOL AND I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH THESE QUICKLY BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU THE MATERIAL SENSE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE INSTEAD OF ASKING YOU FOR URINE SAMPLES I'LL ASK YOU FOR
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P ANYONE HERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO SHARE TO COHABIT WITH A MOUSE A DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP WITH MICE VERY LUCKY
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THE QUINTESSENTIAL MODEL ORGANISM THEY'RE EVEN BETTER MODELS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE NOT ONLY
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THE SAME MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY BUT THEY SHARE YOUR DIET LARGELY THEY SHARE YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS THE ASBESTOS LEVELS AND LEAD LEVELS WHATEVER YOUR EXPOSED TO AND THEY'RE GEOGRAPHICALLY MORE LIMITED THAN YOU ARE BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P COPING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS IS TRICKY IS ANYBODY HERE ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MANHATTAN ARE AND
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P TESTING IF THE
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P SO THIS WAS PROZAC
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THIS WAS ZOLOFT THIS WAS A BLACK JELLYBEAN AND THIS WAS MUSCLE RELAXANT ALL OF WHICH WERE THE MEDICATIONS THAT THE IMPATIENT WAS TAKING SO DO YOU THINK THE MICE SELF ADMINISTERED ANTIDEPRESSANTS
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THAT THEY DID THIS WAS VODKA AND SOLUTION GIN AND SOLUTION THIS GUY ALSO
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P WATER AND THE
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P EXPORT VODKA GIN
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P YES YES YOU KNOW YOUR MICE WELL
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P I WANT TO SORT OF POINT OUT THE BIG ADVANTAGE OF FRAMING HEALTH IN THIS EXTERNAL WAY BUT WE DO HAVE A FEW PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS THROUGH THIS
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE MEDICAL MODEL ANYTHING YOU DO TO IMPROVE YOUR WATER QUALITY OR AIR QUALITY OR TO UNDERSTAND IT OR TO CHANGE IT
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THE BENEFITS ARE ENJOYED BY ANYONE YOU SHARE
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P WATER QUALITY OR AIR QUALITY WITH AND THAT AGGREGATING EFFECT THAT COLLECTIVE ACTION EFFECT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING WE CAN USE TO OUR ADVANTAGE SO I WANT TO SHOW YOU ONE PRESCRIPTION PRODUCT IN THE CLINIC
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P CALLED THE NO PARK THIS IS A PRESCRIPTION TO IMPROVE WATER QUALITY MANY IMPATIENTS ARE VERY CONCERNED FOR WATER QUALITY AND AIR QUALITY
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE A FIRE HYDRANT A NO PARKING SPACE ASSOCIATED WITH A FIRE HYDRANT AND WE PRESCRIBE THE REMOVAL OF THE ASPHALT TO CREATE AN ENGINEERED MICRO LANDSCAPE
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P TO CREATE AN INFILTRATION OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE MANY OF YOU WILL KNOW THAT THE BIGGEST POLLUTION BURDEN THAT WE HAVE ON THE NEW YORK NEW JERSEY HARBOR RIGHT NOW IS NO LONGER THE POINT SOURCES
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P NO LONGER THE BIG POLLUTERS NO LONGER THE GES BUT THAT MASSIVE NETWORK OF ROADS IMPERVIOUS SURFACES THAT COLLECT ALL THAT CADMIUM
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P BRAKE LINERS OR THE OILY HYDROCARBON WASTE IN EVERY SINGLE STORM EVENT AND MEDIEVAL INFRASTRUCTURE WASHES IT STRAIGHT INTO THE ESTUARY SYSTEM
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THAT DOESN'T DO A LOT OF GOOD THESE ARE LITTLE OPPORTUNITIES TO INTERCEPT THOSE POLLUTANTS BEFORE THEY
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P IF WE DID THIS IN EVERY SINGLE EVERY FIRE HYDRANT WE COULD REDEFINE THE EMERGENCY
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THAT NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE TIME WHEN A FIRETRUCK IS NOT PARKING THERE IT'S INFILTRATING
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P UP TO A SEVEN INCH RAIN EVENT UP TO A HUNDRED YEAR STORM SO THESE ARE SMALL ACTIONS THAT CAN AMOUNT TO A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT TO IMPROVE LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P WHAT TO DO SOMEHOW BUYING A LOCAL LETTUCE CHANGING A LIGHT BULB
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P SPEED LIMIT CHANGING YOUR TIRES REGULARLY DOESN'T SEEM SUFFICIENT IN THE FACE OF
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P AND THIS IS AN INTERESTING ICON
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P YOU REMEMBER THESE FALLOUT SHELTERS WHAT IS THE FALLOUT SHELTER FOR THE CLIMATE CRISIS THIS WAS CIVIC MOBILIZATION CHURCHES SCHOOL GROUPS HOSPITALS
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P PRIVATE RESIDENTS EVERYONE BUILD ONE OF THESE IN A MATTER OF MONTHS AND THEY STILL REMAIN AS ICONS OF CIVIC RESPONSE IN THE FACE OF SHARED UNCERTAIN COLLECTIVE THREAT FALLOUT SHELTER FOR THE CLIMATE CRISIS I WOULD SAY LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THIS WHICH IS AN INTENSIVE URBAN AGRICULTURE FACILITY THAT'S DUE TO GO ON MY LAB BUILDING AT NYU WHAT IS DOES IS A VERY
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P SIMPLE IDEA OF TAKING EIGHTY TO NINETY PERCENT OF THE CO TWO PRODUCED IN MANHATTAN IS BUILDING RELATED
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P WE TAKE JUST LIKE A COMMERCIAL GREENHOUSE WE TAKE THE CO TWO FROM THE BUILDING CO TWO ENRICHED AIR WE FORCE IT THROUGH
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THE URBAN AGRICULTURE FACILITY AND THEN WE RESUPPLY OXYGEN ENRICHED AIR YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY BUILD MUCH ON A ROOF THEY'RE NOT DESIGNED FOR THAT SO IT'S ON LEGS
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P SO IT FOCUSES ALL THE LOAD ON THE MASONRY WALLS AND THE COLUMNS IT'S BUILT AS A BARN RAISING USING OPEN SOURCE HARDWARE THIS IS THE QUARTER SCALE PROTOTYPE THAT WAS FUNCTIONING IN SPAIN
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THIS IS WHAT IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE FINGERS CROSSED NYU WILLING AND WHAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU IS ACTUALLY THIS IS ONE OF THE COMPONENTS OF IT THAT WE'VE JUST RECENTLY BEEN TESTING
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P WHICH IS A SOLAR CHIMNEY WE HAVE GOT SEVENTEEN OF THEM NOW PUT AROUND NEW YORK AT THE MOMENT THAT PASSIVELY DRAWS AIR UP YOU UNDERSTAND A SOLAR CHIMNEY HOT AIR RISES
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THAT ACTUALLY REMOVES ABOUT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE CARBON BLACK THAT STUFF THAT WITH OZONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ABOUT HALF OF GLOBAL WARMING 'S EFFECTS BECAUSE IT CHANGES IT SETTLES ON THE SNOW IT CHANGES THE REFLECTORS IT CHANGES THE
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P WHEN WE PUT IT THROUGH OUR SOLAR CHIMNEY WE REMOVE ACTUALLY ABOUT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THAT AND THEN I SWAP IT OUT WITH THE
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P ONE OF THEM THAT WE HAVE UP NOW HERE 'S WHO PUT THEM UP AND WHO ARE AVID PENCIL USERS OKAY SO I WANT TO SHOW YOU JUST TWO MORE INTERFACES BECAUSE
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P I THINK ONE OF OUR BIG CHALLENGES IS RE IMAGINING OUR RELATIONSHIP TO NATURAL SYSTEMS NOT ONLY THROUGH THIS MODEL OF
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P TWISTED PERSONALIZED HEALTH BUT THROUGH THE ANIMALS WITH WHOM WE COHABIT WE ARE NOT ALONE THE ANIMALS ARE MOVING IN IN FACT URBAN MIGRATION NOW DESCRIBES THE MOVEMENT OF ANIMALS FORMERLY KNOWN AS WILD
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P INTO URBAN CENTERS YOU KNOW COYOTE IN CENTRAL PARK A WHALE IN THE GOWANUS CANAL ELK IN WESTCHESTER COUNTY IT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER THE DEVELOPED WORLD PROBABLY FOR LOSS OF HABITAT BUT ALSO BECAUSE OUR CITIES
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE LIVABLE THAN THEY HAVE BEEN AND EVERY GREEN SPACE WE CREATE IS AN INVITATION FOR NON HUMANS TO COHABIT WITH US BUT WE'VE KIND OF LACKED IMAGINATION IN HOW WE COULD DO THAT WELL OR INTERESTINGLY
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P TO TRY AND REFORM THAT RELATIONSHIP THIS IS COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY FOR BIRDS I LOOKS LIKE THIS WHEN A BIRD LANDS ON IT THEY TRIGGER A SOUND FILE
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P IS ACTUALLY IN THE WHITNEY MUSEUM WHERE THERE WERE SIX OF THEM EACH OF WHICH HAD A DIFFERENT ARGUMENT ON IT DIFFERENT SOUND FILE THEY SAID THINGS LIKE THIS
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P WHAT YOU NEED TO DO GO DOWN THERE AND BUY SOME OF THOSE HEALTH FOOD BARS THE ONES YOU CALL BIRD FOOD AND BRING IT HERE AND SCATTER IT AROUND THERE'S A GOOD
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P SO THERE WAS SEVERAL OF THESE THE BIRDS WERE ABLE TO JUMP FROM ONE TO THE OTHER THESE ARE JUST YOUR AVERAGE URBAN PIGEON AND AN EARLY TEST
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THAT'S THE SOUND OF GENETIC MUTATIONS OF THE AVIAN FLU BECOMING A DEADLY HUMAN FLU
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P YOU KNOW WHAT SLOWS IT DOWN HEALTHY SUB POPULATIONS OF BIRDS INCREASING BIODIVERSITY GENERALLY
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P IT IS IN YOUR INTERESTS THAT I'M HEALTHY HAPPY WELL FED HENCE YOU COULD SHARE SOME OF YOUR NUTRITIONAL RESOURCES INSTEAD OF MONOPOLIZING THEM
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THAT IS SHARE YOUR LUNCH
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P AND IT'S TRUE THE FINAL PROJECT I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU IS A NEW INTERFACE FOR FISH THAT HAS JUST BEEN LAUNCHED IT'S ACTUALLY OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED NEXT WEEK
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THAT FLOAT ON THE WATER PROJECT THREE FOOT UP THREE FOOT DOWN WHEN A FISH SWIMS UNDERNEATH A LIGHT GOES ON THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P SO THERE'S ANOTHER FUNCTION ON HERE THIS TOP LIGHT IS I'M SORRY IF I'M MAKING YOU SEASICK THIS TOP LIGHT IS ACTUALLY A WATER QUALITY DISPLAY
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THAT SHIFTS FROM RED WHEN THE DISSOLVED OXYGEN IS LOW TO A BLUE GREEN WHEN ITS DISSOLVED OXYGEN IS HIGH AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO TEXT
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THE FISH SO THERE'S BUSINESS CARDS DOWN THERE THAT'LL GIVE YOU CONTACT DETAILS AND THEY TEXT BACK WHEN THE BUOYS GET YOUR TEXT THEY WINK AT YOU TWICE TO SAY WE'VE GOT YOUR MESSAGE
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P BUT PERHAPS THE MOST POPULAR HAS BEEN THAT WE'VE GOT ANOTHER ARRAY OF THESE BOYS IN THE BRONX RIVER WHERE THE FIRST BEAVER
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P CRAZY AS HE IS TO HAVE MOVED IN AND BUILT A LODGE IN NEW YORK IN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS HANGS OUT SO UPDATES FROM A BEAVER YOU CAN SUBSCRIBE TO UPDATES FROM HIM
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P TALK TO HIM AND WHAT I LIKE TO THINK OF IS THIS IS AN INTERFACE THAT RE SCRIPTS
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P HOW WE INTERACT WITH NATURAL SYSTEMS SPECIFICALLY BY CHANGING WHO HAS INFORMATION WHERE THEY HAVE IT WHO CAN MAKE SENSE OF THAT INFORMATION AND WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P IN THIS CASE INSTEAD OF THROWING CHEWING GUM OR DORITOS OR WHATEVER YOU HAVE IN YOUR POCKET AT THE FISH
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P AND SO EVERY TIME THAT DESIRE TO INTERACT WITH THE ANIMALS WHICH IS
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P AT LEAST AS UBIQUITOUS AS THAT SIGN DO NOT FEED THE ANIMALS AND THERE'S ABOUT THREE OF THEM ON EVERY NEW YORK CITY PARK AND YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK THERE'S MORE
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P DO NOT FEED THE ANIMALS SIGNS THAN THERE ARE ANIMALS YOU MIGHT WISH TO FEED BUT IN THAT ACTION THAT INTERACTION BY RE SCRIPTING THAT
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P BY CHANGING IT INTO AN OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER FOOD THAT IS NUTRITIONALLY APPROPRIATE THAT COULD AUGMENT THE NUTRITIONAL RESOURCES THAT WE OURSELVES HAVE DEPLETED
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P ARE IN THE FISH LIVING IN THIS PARTICULAR
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P AND ALLOWS THEM TO PASS IT OUT AS A HARMLESS SALT WHERE IT'S COMPLEXED BY A REACTIVE EFFECTIVELY REMOVING IT FROM BIOAVAILABILITY
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P BUT I WANTED TO SAY THAT INTERACTION RE SCRIPTING THAT INTERACTION INTO COLLECTIVE ACTION COLLECTIVE REMEDIATIVE ACTION VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE APPROACH
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P BEING USED ON THE OTHER SIDE ON THE HUDSON RIVER WHERE WE'RE DREDGING
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P PCBS AFTER THIRTY YEARS OF
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P WE'RE DREDGING IT AND IT'LL PROBABLY GET SHIPPED OFF TO PENNSYLVANIA OR THE NEAREST THIRD WORLD COUNTRY WHERE IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE TOXIC SLUDGE
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P ACTUALLY TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES NEW INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGIES PRESENT TO RE SCRIPT OUR INTERACTIONS
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P THAT CAN AMOUNT TO SOMETHING WE CAN REALLY BEGIN TO ADDRESS SOME OF OUR IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES THANK YOU
