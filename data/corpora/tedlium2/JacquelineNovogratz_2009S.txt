JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@16.92:26.12 WE'RE LIVING IN A MOMENT OF CRISIS ARGUABLY THE FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE FAILED US AND THE AID SYSTEM IS FAILING US AND YET I STAND FIRMLY
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@26.69:33.97 THE OPTIMISTS WHO BELIEVE THAT THERE HAS PROBABLY NEVER BEEN A MORE EXCITING MOMENT TO BE ALIVE BECAUSE OF SOME OF TECHNOLOGIES WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@60.49:66.79 YOU WORK ON THE FRONT LINES AND YOU'VE SEEN THE BEST AND THE WORST THAT HUMAN BEINGS CAN DO FOR ONE ANOTHER AND TO ONE ANOTHER
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@67.23:75.58 AND NO MATTER WHAT COUNTRY YOU LIVE OR WORK IN YOU'VE ALSO SEEN THE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE CAPABLE OF EVEN IN THEIR MOST ORDINARINESS
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@76.63:89.78 TODAY THERE IS A RAGING DEBATE AS TO HOW BEST WE LIFT PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY HOW BEST WE RELEASE THEIR ENERGIES ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT SAY THE AID SYSTEM IS SO BROKEN WE NEED TO THROW IT OUT
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@90.09:99.60 AND ON THE OTHER WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO SAY THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE NEED MORE AID AND WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS SOMETHING THAT COMPLIMENTS BOTH SYSTEMS WE CALL IT PATIENT CAPITAL
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@112.20:119.67 RAMPANT CORRUPTION THEY USE MOBUTU AS METAPHOR AND THEIR POLICY PRESCRIPTION IS TO
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@120.19:126.80 MAKE GOVERNMENT MORE ACCOUNTABLE FOCUS ON THE CAPITAL MARKETS INVEST DON'T GIVE ANYTHING AWAY
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@127.29:136.62 ON THE OTHER SIDE AS I SAID THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE NEED MORE MONEY THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE RICH WE'LL BAIL OUT AND WE'LL HAND A LOT OF AID BUT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@138.93:146.80 LITTLE TO DO WITH IT THEY POINT TO THE SUCCESSES OF AID THE ERADICATION OF SMALLPOX AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@147.32:160.04 MALARIA BED NETS AND ANTIRETROVIRALS BOTH SIDES ARE RIGHT AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT NEITHER SIDE IS LISTENING TO THE OTHER EVEN MORE PROBLEMATIC THEY'RE NOT LISTENING TO POOR PEOPLE THEMSELVES
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@173.57:183.85 THEY MUST NAVIGATE MARKETS DAILY MAKING MICRO DECISIONS DOZENS AND DOZENS TO MOVE THEIR WAY THROUGH SOCIETY AND YET IF A SINGLE CATASTROPHIC HEALTH
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@184.40:195.88 PROBLEM IMPACTS THEIR FAMILY THEY COULD BE PUT BACK INTO POVERTY SOMETIMES FOR GENERATIONS AND SO WE NEED BOTH THE MARKET AND WE NEED AID PATIENT CAPITAL
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@196.87:205.38 WORKS BETWEEN AND TRIES TO TAKE THE BEST OF BOTH IT'S MONEY THAT'S INVESTED IN ENTREPRENEURS WHO KNOW THEIR COMMUNITIES AND ARE BUILDING SOLUTIONS TO
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@205.90:212.73 HEALTHCARE WATER HOUSING ALTERNATIVE ENERGY THINKING OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE NOT AS PASSIVE RECIPIENTS OF CHARITY
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@213.20:223.59 BUT AS INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS CONSUMERS CLIENTS PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THEIR OWN LIVES PATIENT CAPITAL REQUIRES THAT WE HAVE INCREDIBLE TOLERANCE FOR RISK
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@223.82:237.24 A LONG TIME HORIZON IN TERMS OF ALLOWING THOSE ENTREPRENEURS TIME TO EXPERIMENT TO USE THE MARKET AS THE BEST LISTENING DEVICE THAT WE HAVE AND THE EXPECTATION OF BELOW MARKET RETURNS BUT OUTSIZED SOCIAL IMPACT
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@238.57:249.19 IT RECOGNIZES THAT THE MARKET HAS ITS LIMITATION AND SO PATIENT CAPITAL ALSO WORKS WITH SMART SUBSIDY TO EXTEND THE BENEFITS OF A GLOBAL ECONOMY TO INCLUDE ALL PEOPLE
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@249.51:260.73 NOW ENTREPRENEURS NEED PATIENT CAPITAL FOR THREE REASONS FIRST THEY TEND TO WORK IN MARKETS WHERE PEOPLE MAKE ONE TWO THREE DOLLARS A DAY AND THEY ARE MAKING ALL OF THEIR DECISIONS WITHIN THAT INCOME LEVEL
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@261.31:269.85 SECOND THE GEOGRAPHIES IN WHICH THEY WORK HAVE TERRIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE NO ROADS TO SPEAK OF SPORADIC ELECTRICITY AND HIGH LEVELS OF CORRUPTION
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@270.91:278.26 THIRD THEY ARE OFTEN CREATING MARKETS EVEN IF YOU'RE BRINGING CLEAN WATER FOR THE FIRST TIME INTO RURAL VILLAGES IT IS SOMETHING NEW
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@278.47:286.99 AND SO MANY LOW INCOME PEOPLE HAVE SEEN SO MANY FAILED PROMISES BROKEN AND SEEN SO MANY QUACKS AND SPORADIC
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@287.43:296.83 OFFERED TO THEM THAT BUILDING TRUST TAKES A LOT OF TIME TAKES A LOT OF PATIENCE IT ALSO REQUIRES BEING CONNECTED TO A LOT OF MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@297.15:303.60 NOT ONLY TO BUILD THE SYSTEMS THE BUSINESS MODELS THAT ALLOW US TO REACH LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@303.79:311.57 BUT TO CONNECT THOSE BUSINESS TO OTHER MARKETS TO GOVERNMENTS TO CORPORATIONS REAL PARTNERSHIPS IF WE WANT TO GET TO SCALE
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@337.11:345.81 THEY WERE CREATING SUBSIDIES EITHER FOR LARGE FARMS OR THEY WERE GIVING INPUTS TO THE FARMERS THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY SHOULD USE RATHER THAN THAT THE FARMERS WANTED TO USE
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@346.19:359.82 AT THE SAME TIME AMITABHA WAS OBSESSED WITH THIS DRIP IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGY THAT HAD BEEN INVENTED IN ISRAEL IT WAS A WAY OF BRINGING SMALL AMOUNTS OF WATER DIRECTLY TO THE STALK OF THE PLANT AND IT COULD
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@361.57:367.86 OF DESERT LAND INTO FIELDS OF EMERALD GREEN BUT THE MARKET ALSO HAD BYPASSED LOW INCOME FARMERS
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@368.13:377.39 BECAUSE THESE SYSTEMS WERE BOTH TOO EXPENSIVE AND THEY WERE CONSTRUCTED FOR FIELDS THAT WERE TOO LARGE THE AVERAGE SMALL VILLAGE FARMER WORKS ON TWO ACRES OR LESS
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@388.50:398.08 WHAT HE THOUGH THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE AND HE USED THREE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES THE FIRST ONE WAS MINIATURIZATION THE DRIP IRRIGATION SYSTEM HAD TO BE SMALL
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@410.95:422.95 IN OTHER WORDS THAT RISK ON THE QUARTER ACRE NEEDED TO BE REPAID IN A SINGLE HARVEST OR ELSE THEY WOULDN'T TAKE THE RISK AND THIRD IT HAD TO BE WHAT AMITABHA CALLS INFINITELY EXPANDABLE
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@423.55:433.89 WHAT I MEAN IS WITH THE PROFITS FROM THE FIRST QUARTER ACRE THE FARMERS COULD BUY A SECOND AND A THIRD AND A FOURTH AS OF TODAY IDE INDIA AMITABHA 'S ORGANIZATION HAS SOLD
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@434.14:442.62 OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FARMERS THESE SYSTEMS AND HAS SEEN THEIR YIELDS AND INCOMES DOUBLE OR TRIPLE ON AVERAGE BUT THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@443.14:455.89 IN FACT WHEN YOU GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING THERE WERE NO PRIVATE INVESTORS WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE A RISK ON BUILDING A NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR A MARKET CLASS THAT MADE UNDER A DOLLAR A DAY THAT WERE KNOWN TO BE SOME OF THE MOST RISK AVERSE PEOPLE ON THE PLANET
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@456.26:467.78 AND THAT WERE WORKING IN ONE OF THE RISKIEST SECTORS AGRICULTURE AND SO WE NEEDED GRANTS AND HE USED SIGNIFICANT GRANTS TO RESEARCH TO EXPERIMENT TO FAIL TO INNOVATE AND TRY AGAIN
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@468.11:477.57 AND WHEN HE HAD A PROTOTYPE AND HAD A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO MARKET TO FARMERS THAT'S WHEN PATIENT CAPITAL COULD COME IN AND WE HELPED HIM BUILD A COMPANY
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@478.02:487.31 FOR PROFIT THAT WOULD BUILD ON IDE 'S KNOWLEDGE AND START LOOKING AT SALES AND EXPORTS AND BE ABLE TO TAP INTO OTHER KINDS OF CAPITAL
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@497.26:505.27 PAKISTAN AND WHILE AGAIN YOU NEEDED PATIENCE TO MOVE A TECHNOLOGY FOR THE POOR IN INDIA INTO PAKISTAN JUST TO GET THE PERMITS
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@505.86:512.87 OVER TIME WE WERE ABLE TO START A COMPANY WITH WITH DOCTOR SONO WHO RUNS A LARGE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@513.90:523.15 WHICH IS ONE OF THE REMOTE AND POOREST AREAS OF THE COUNTRY AND THOUGH THAT COMPANY HAS JUST STARTED OUR ASSUMPTION IS THAT THERE TOO WE'LL SEE THE IMPACT ON MILLIONS
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@524.11:533.49 BUT DRIP IRRIGATION ISN'T THE ONLY INNOVATION WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THESE HAPPENING ALL AROUND THE WORLD IN ARUSHA TANZANIA A TO Z TEXTILE MANUFACTURING
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@533.79:545.77 HAS WORKED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH US WITH UNICEF WITH THE GLOBAL FUND TO CREATE A FACTORY THAT NOW EMPLOYS SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE MOSTLY WOMEN AND THEY PRODUCE TWENTY MILLION LIFESAVING BEDNETS FOR AFRICANS AROUND THE WORLD
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@591.24:600.39 JUST WON FOUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS TO BUILD OFF THEIR ONE HUNDRED AMBULANCES AND ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE AMBULANCE COMPANIES IN INDIA
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@612.09:619.82 AND IT'S WHERE THE IDEA OF PARTNERSHIP BECOMES SO IMPORTANT WHETHER IT'S BY FINDING THOSE INNOVATIONS THAT CAN ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@637.58:649.98 THAT IT'S TIME TO CONSIDER A GLOBAL INNOVATION FUND THAT WOULD FIND THESE ENTREPRENEURS AROUND THE WORLD WHO REALLY HAVE INNOVATIONS NOT ONLY FOR THEIR COUNTRY BUT ONES THAT WE CAN USE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD AS WELL INVEST
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@658.57:665.51 IMPACT PERSPECTIVE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT NEW APPROACHES TO AID IT'S IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO TALK ABOUT
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@667.26:673.11 A ROCKY RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT COUNTRY AND IN ALL FAIRNESS THE UNITED STATES HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN A VERY
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@683.53:691.67 WE COULD USE THIS TIME TO INVEST NOT DIRECTLY IN GOVERNMENT THOUGH WE WOULD HAVE GOVERNMENT 'S BLESSING NOR IN INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@692.04:699.46 BUT IN THE MANY EXISTING ENTREPRENEURS AND CIVIL SOCIETY LEADERS WHO ALREADY ARE BUILDING WONDERFUL
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@715.58:726.99 WHERE HE HAS MOVED FORTY THOUSAND SLUM DWELLERS INTO SAFE AFFORDABLE COMMUNITY HOUSING EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES LIKE DIL AND THE CITIZEN FOUNDATION THAT ARE BUILDING SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@727.56:734.65 IT'S NOT HYPERBOLE TO SAY THAT THESE CIVIL SOCIETY INSTITUTIONS AND THESE SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURS ARE BUILDING REAL ALTERNATIVES TO THE
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@750.41:760.58 PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAID THAT THOSE WHO MAKE PEACEFUL REVOLUTION IMPOSSIBLE MAKE VIOLENT REVOLUTION INEVITABLE I WOULD SAY THAT THE CONVERSE IS TRUE
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@761.37:770.16 THAT THESE SOCIAL LEADERS WHO REALLY ARE LOOKING AT INNOVATION AND EXTENDING OPPORTUNITY TO THE SEVENTY PERCENT OF PAKISTANIS WHO MAKE LESS THAN TWO DOLLARS A DAY
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@770.78:778.83 PROVIDE REAL PATHWAYS TO HOPE AND AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE CONSTRUCT AID FOR PAKISTAN WHILE WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE JUDICIARY
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@779.23:786.74 BUILD GREATER STABILITY WE ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT LIFTING THOSE LEADERS WHO CAN BE ROLE MODELS FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@787.81:794.66 ON ONE OF MY LAST VISITS TO PAKISTAN I ASKED DOCTOR SONO IF HE WOULD TAKE ME TO SEE SOME OF THE DRIP IRRIGATION IN
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@795.49:805.33 AND WE LEFT KARACHI ONE MORNING BEFORE DAWN IT WAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN DEGREES AND WE DROVE FOR EIGHT HOURS ALONG THIS MOONSCAPE LIKE LANDSCAPE WITH
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@805.70:819.48 VERY LITTLE COLOR LOTS OF HEAT VERY LITTLE DISCUSSION BECAUSE WE WERE EXHAUSTED AND FINALLY AT THE END OF THE JOURNEY I COULD SEE THIS THIN LITTLE YELLOW LINE ACROSS THE HORIZON AND AS WE GOT CLOSER ITS SIGNIFICANCE BECAME APPARENT
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@819.96:830.18 THAT THERE IN THE DESERT WAS A FIELD OF SUNFLOWERS GROWING SEVEN FEET TALL BECAUSE ONE OF THE POOREST FARMERS ON EARTH HAD GOTTEN ACCESS TO A TECHNOLOGY THAT HAD ALLOWED HIM
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@830.54:834.93 TO CHANGE HIS OWN LIFE HIS NAME WAS RAJA AND HE HAD
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@835.20:844.04 KIND TWINKLY HAZEL EYES AND WARM EXPRESSIVE HANDS THAT REMINDED ME OF MY FATHER AND HE SAID IT WAS THE FIRST DRY SEASON IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@844.31:854.43 THAT HE HADN'T TAKEN HIS TWELVE CHILDREN AND FIFTY GRANDCHILDREN ON A TWO DAY JOURNEY ACROSS THE DESERT TO WORK AS DAY LABORERS AT A COMMERCIAL FARM FOR ABOUT FIFTY CENTS A DAY
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@871.61:878.01 BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THEM DISCRIMINATED AGAINST ANYMORE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT SOLUTIONS TO POVERTY
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@887.28:900.09 AND WHAT'S EXCITING IS TO SEE SO MANY ENTREPRENEURS ACROSS SECTORS WHO ARE BUILDING INNOVATIONS THAT RECOGNIZE THAT WHAT PEOPLE WANT IS FREEDOM AND CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE DIGNITY REALLY STARTS
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@901.11:910.85 MARTIN LUTHER KING SAID THAT LOVE WITHOUT POWER IS ANEMIC AND SENTIMENTAL AND THAT POWER WITHOUT LOVE IS RECKLESS AND
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@912.54:922.63 OUR GENERATION HAS SEEN BOTH APPROACHES TRIED AND OFTEN FAIL BUT I THINK OUR GENERATION ALSO MIGHT BE THE FIRST TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO EMBRACE BOTH LOVE
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@924.22:930.02 FOR THAT IS WHAT WE'LL NEED AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO DREAM AND IMAGINE WHAT IT WILL REALLY TAKE
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@940.11:949.09 THE TIME FOR US TO BEGIN INNOVATING AND LOOKING FOR NEW SOLUTIONS A CROSS SECTOR IS NOW I CAN ONLY TALK FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@949.64:957.05 BUT IN EIGHT YEARS OF RUNNING ACUMEN FUND I'VE SEEN THE POWER OF PATIENT CAPITAL NOT ONLY TO
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@970.27:984.58 I KNOW IT WORKS BUT I KNOW THAT MANY OTHER KINDS OF INNOVATION ALSO WORK AND SO I URGE YOU IN WHATEVER SECTOR YOU WORK IN WHATEVER JOB YOU DO TO START THINKING ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT BUILD SOLUTIONS THAT START
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@984.97:999.77 FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THOSE WE'RE TRYING TO HELP RATHER THAN WHAT WE THINK THAT THEY MIGHT NEED I WILL TAKE EMBRACING THE WORLD WITH BOTH ARMS AND IT WILL TAKE LIVING WITH THE SPIRIT OF GENEROSITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S@1000.93:1008.05 A SENSE OF INTEGRITY AND PERSEVERANCE AND YET THESE ARE THE VERY QUALITIES FOR WHICH MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN HONORED
