ThandieNewton_2011G@21.96:36.23 AND THE JOURNEY TO THAT PLACE OF UNDERSTANDING AND ACCEPTANCE HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING ONE FOR ME AND IT 'S GIVEN ME AN INSIGHT INTO THE WHOLE NOTION OF SELF WHICH I THINK IS WORTH SHARING WITH YOU TODAY
ThandieNewton_2011G@37.07:41.7 WE EACH HAVE A SELF BUT I DON 'T THINK THAT WE 'RE BORN WITH ONE
ThandieNewton_2011G@42.47:57.61 YOU KNOW HOW NEWBORN BABIES BELIEVE THEY 'RE PART OF EVERYTHING THEY 'RE NOT SEPARATE WELL THAT FUNDAMENTAL SENSE OF ONENESS IS LOST ON US VERY QUICKLY IT 'S LIKE THAT INITIAL STAGE IS OVER ONENESS INFANCY
ThandieNewton_2011G@57.72:61.68 UNFORMED PRIMITIVE IT 'S NO LONGER VALID OR REAL
ThandieNewton_2011G@62.07:66.65 WHAT IS REAL IS SEPARATENESS AND AT SOME POINT IN EARLY BABYHOOD
ThandieNewton_2011G@66.96:69.47 THE IDEA OF SELF STARTS TO FORM
ThandieNewton_2011G@69.83:76 OUR LITTLE PORTION OF ONENESS IS GIVEN A NAME IS TOLD ALL KINDS OF THINGS ABOUT ITSELF
ThandieNewton_2011G@76:90.69 AND THESE DETAILS OPINIONS AND IDEAS BECOME FACTS WHICH GO TOWARDS BUILDING OURSELVES OUR IDENTITY AND THAT SELF BECOMES THE VEHICLE FOR NAVIGATING OUR SOCIAL WORLD
ThandieNewton_2011G@96.68:98.78 IS IT WHO WE REALLY ARE
ThandieNewton_2011G@99.11:101.02 OR WHO WE REALLY WANT TO BE
ThandieNewton_2011G@117.21:131.11 AND MY PANIC AT NOT HAVING A SELF THAT FIT AND THE CONFUSION THAT CAME FROM MY SELF BEING REJECTED CREATED ANXIETY SHAME AND HOPELESSNESS WHICH KIND OF DEFINED ME FOR A LONG TIME
ThandieNewton_2011G@138.36:140.42 THE SELF CHANGED
ThandieNewton_2011G@148.94:150.56 SOMETIMES HATEFUL
ThandieNewton_2011G@150.88:152.96 SOMETIMES NOT WANTING TO BE THERE AT ALL
ThandieNewton_2011G@153.43:156.68 THE SELF WAS NOT CONSTANT
ThandieNewton_2011G@161.55:165.14 BEFORE I REALIZED THAT IT WAS NEVER ALIVE IN THE FIRST PLACE
ThandieNewton_2011G@173.47:176.14 AND MY MOM IS BLACK FROM ZIMBABWE
ThandieNewton_2011G@177.06:181.51 EVEN THE IDEA OF US AS A FAMILY WAS CHALLENGING TO MOST PEOPLE
ThandieNewton_2011G@181.88:185.12 BUT NATURE HAD ITS WICKED WAY AND BROWN BABIES WERE BORN
ThandieNewton_2011G@186.16:190.71 BUT FROM ABOUT THE AGE OF FIVE I WAS AWARE THAT I DIDN 'T FIT
ThandieNewton_2011G@191.25:199.42 I WAS THE BLACK ATHEIST KID IN THE ALL WHITE CATHOLIC SCHOOL RUN BY NUNS I WAS AN ANOMALY
ThandieNewton_2011G@199.74:205.39 AND MY SELF WAS ROOTING AROUND FOR DEFINITION AND TRYING TO PLUG IN
ThandieNewton_2011G@206.14:208.35 BECAUSE THE SELF LIKES TO FIT
ThandieNewton_2011G@208.6:211.89 TO SEE ITSELF REPLICATED TO BELONG
ThandieNewton_2011G@212.65:230.19 THAT CONFIRMS ITS EXISTENCE AND ITS IMPORTANCE AND IT IS IMPORTANT IT HAS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FUNCTION WITHOUT IT WE LITERALLY CAN 'T INTERFACE WITH OTHERS WE CAN 'T HATCH PLANS AND CLIMB THAT STAIRWAY OF POPULARITY OF SUCCESS
ThandieNewton_2011G@231.32:233.18 BUT MY SKIN COLOR WASN 'T RIGHT
ThandieNewton_2011G@234.14:235.72 MY HAIR WASN 'T RIGHT
ThandieNewton_2011G@236.03:245.35 MY HISTORY WASN 'T RIGHT MY SELF BECAME DEFINED BY OTHERNESS WHICH MEANT THAT IN THAT SOCIAL WORLD I DIDN 'T REALLY EXIST
ThandieNewton_2011G@246.35:251.24 AND I WAS OTHER BEFORE BEING ANYTHING ELSE EVEN BEFORE BEING A GIRL
ThandieNewton_2011G@252.12:254.63 I WAS A NOTICEABLE NOBODY
ThandieNewton_2011G@255.88:257.82 ANOTHER WORLD WAS OPENING UP
ThandieNewton_2011G@258.45:261.39 AROUND THIS TIME PERFORMANCE
ThandieNewton_2011G@268.8:271.52 I 'D LITERALLY LOSE MYSELF
ThandieNewton_2011G@272.38:283.37 AND I WAS A REALLY GOOD DANCER I WOULD PUT ALL MY EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION INTO MY DANCING I COULD BE IN THE MOVEMENT
ThandieNewton_2011G@283.81:289.19 IN A WAY THAT I WASN 'T ABLE TO BE IN MY REAL LIFE IN MYSELF
ThandieNewton_2011G@289.36:297.41 AND AT SIXTEEN I STUMBLED ACROSS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY AND I EARNED MY FIRST ACTING ROLE IN A FILM
ThandieNewton_2011G@297.74:304.39 I CAN HARDLY FIND THE WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE PEACE I FELT WHEN I WAS ACTING
ThandieNewton_2011G@304.93:311.02 MY DYSFUNCTIONAL SELF COULD ACTUALLY PLUG IN TO ANOTHER SELF NOT MY OWN
ThandieNewton_2011G@311.39:313.18 AND IT FELT SO GOOD
ThandieNewton_2011G@314.07:319.67 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I EXISTED INSIDE A FULLY FUNCTIONING SELF
ThandieNewton_2011G@319.89:321.65 ONE THAT I CONTROLLED
ThandieNewton_2011G@327.41:329.21 BUT THE SHOOTING DAY WOULD END
ThandieNewton_2011G@329.5:331.81 AND I 'D RETURN TO MY GNARLY
ThandieNewton_2011G@339.75:342.07 BUT STILL SEARCHING FOR DEFINITION
ThandieNewton_2011G@342.75:345.98 I APPLIED TO READ ANTHROPOLOGY AT UNIVERSITY
ThandieNewton_2011G@346.86:348.42 DR PHYLLIS LEE
ThandieNewton_2011G@348.51:357.72 GAVE ME MY INTERVIEW AND SHE ASKED ME HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE RACE WELL I THOUGHT I HAD THE ANSWER TO THAT ONE AND I SAID SKIN COLOR
ThandieNewton_2011G@358.19:361.12 SO BIOLOGY GENETICS SHE SAID
ThandieNewton_2011G@379.81:383.54 THERE 'S BEEN MORE TIME TO CREATE GENETIC DIVERSITY
ThandieNewton_2011G@391.88:394.21 ON THE ONE HAND RESULT
ThandieNewton_2011G@402.61:404.16 BUT WHAT WAS CREDIBLE
ThandieNewton_2011G@404.18:415.41 WHAT IS BIOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC FACT IS THAT WE ALL STEM FROM AFRICA IN FACT FROM A WOMAN CALLED MITOCHONDRIAL EVE WHO LIVED ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO
ThandieNewton_2011G@415.9:423.99 AND RACE IS AN ILLEGITIMATE CONCEPT WHICH OUR SELVES HAVE CREATED BASED ON FEAR AND IGNORANCE
ThandieNewton_2011G@424.98:432.51 STRANGELY THESE REVELATIONS DIDN 'T CURE MY LOW SELF ESTEEM THAT FEELING OF OTHERNESS
ThandieNewton_2011G@433:436.79 MY DESIRE TO DISAPPEAR WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
ThandieNewton_2011G@437.24:444.5 I HAD A DEGREE FROM CAMBRIDGE I HAD A THRIVING CAREER BUT MY SELF WAS A CAR CRASH
ThandieNewton_2011G@444.8:449.77 AND I WOUND UP WITH BULIMIA AND ON A THERAPIST 'S COUCH AND OF COURSE I DID
ThandieNewton_2011G@449.9:453.96 I STILL BELIEVED MY SELF WAS ALL I WAS
ThandieNewton_2011G@454.03:457.88 I STILL VALUED SELF WORTH ABOVE ALL OTHER WORTH
ThandieNewton_2011G@458.33:460.56 AND WHAT WAS THERE TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE
ThandieNewton_2011G@460.82:467.05 WE 'VE CREATED ENTIRE VALUE SYSTEMS AND A PHYSICAL REALITY TO SUPPORT THE WORTH OF SELF
ThandieNewton_2011G@467.09:473.37 LOOK AT THE INDUSTRY FOR SELF IMAGE AND THE JOBS IT CREATES THE REVENUE IT TURNS OVER
ThandieNewton_2011G@473.99:479.41 WE 'D BE RIGHT IN ASSUMING THAT THE SELF IS AN ACTUAL LIVING THING BUT IT 'S NOT
ThandieNewton_2011G@489.19:490.77 BUT THERE IS SOMETHING
ThandieNewton_2011G@496.21:498.75 AND THAT THING IS ONENESS
ThandieNewton_2011G@514.42:519.78 AWARENESS OF THE REALITY OF ONENESS AND THE PROJECTION OF SELF HOOD
ThandieNewton_2011G@520.42:525.2 FOR A START WE CAN THINK ABOUT ALL THE TIMES WHEN WE DO LOSE OURSELVES
ThandieNewton_2011G@525.39:528.51 IT HAPPENS WHEN I DANCE WHEN I 'M ACTING
ThandieNewton_2011G@534.51:536.88 IN THOSE MOMENTS I 'M CONNECTED
ThandieNewton_2011G@547.43:552.82 IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS AN INFANT MIGHT FEEL THAT FEELING OF ONENESS
ThandieNewton_2011G@553.8:555.5 AND WHEN I 'M ACTING A ROLE
ThandieNewton_2011G@555.92:557.87 I INHABIT ANOTHER SELF
ThandieNewton_2011G@558.58:560.57 AND I GIVE IT LIFE FOR AWHILE
ThandieNewton_2011G@560.68:562.93 BECAUSE WHEN THE SELF IS SUSPENDED
ThandieNewton_2011G@563.42:565.33 SO IS DIVISIVENESS
ThandieNewton_2011G@565.39:567.08 AND JUDGMENT
ThandieNewton_2011G@567.21:574.31 AND I 'VE PLAYED EVERYTHING FROM A VENGEFUL GHOST IN THE TIME OF SLAVERY TO SECRETARY OF STATE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR
ThandieNewton_2011G@575.35:577.03 AND NO MATTER HOW OTHER
ThandieNewton_2011G@577.49:579.2 THESE SELVES MIGHT BE
ThandieNewton_2011G@583.01:584.69 AND I HONESTLY BELIEVE
ThandieNewton_2011G@585.07:587.88 THE KEY TO MY SUCCESS AS AN ACTOR
ThandieNewton_2011G@587.94:595.78 AND MY PROGRESS AS A PERSON HAS BEEN THE VERY LACK OF SELF THAT USED TO MAKE ME FEEL SO ANXIOUS AND INSECURE
ThandieNewton_2011G@596.75:606.37 I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY I COULD FEEL OTHERS PAIN SO DEEPLY WHY I COULD RECOGNIZE THE SOMEBODY IN THE NOBODY
ThandieNewton_2011G@607.17:610.11 IT 'S BECAUSE I DIDN 'T HAVE A SELF TO GET IN THE WAY
ThandieNewton_2011G@610.99:613.29 I THOUGHT I LACKED SUBSTANCE
ThandieNewton_2011G@619.75:622.16 THE THING THAT WAS A SOURCE OF SHAME
ThandieNewton_2011G@622.68:625.07 WAS ACTUALLY A SOURCE OF ENLIGHTENMENT
ThandieNewton_2011G@625.34:627.05 AND WHEN I REALIZED
ThandieNewton_2011G@627.51:629.2 AND REALLY UNDERSTOOD
ThandieNewton_2011G@641.61:649.09 VERY FAMILIAR WITH ITS DYSFUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR BUT I 'M NOT ASHAMED OF MY SELF IN FACT I RESPECT MY SELF
ThandieNewton_2011G@656.08:658.2 MORE AND MORE FROM MY ESSENCE
ThandieNewton_2011G@666.15:674.55 DANCING AND CELEBRATING WITH WOMEN WHO 'VE SURVIVED THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR SELVES IN LITERALLY UNTHINKABLE WAYS
ThandieNewton_2011G@675.12:686.76 DESTROYED BECAUSE OTHER BRUTALIZED PSYCHOPATHIC SELVES ALL OVER THAT BEAUTIFUL LAND ARE FUELING OUR SELVES ADDICTION TO IPODS PADS AND BLING
ThandieNewton_2011G@700.84:705.08 THEN WE 'RE DEVALUING AND DESENSITIZING LIFE
ThandieNewton_2011G@705.4:707.59 AND IN THAT DISCONNECTED STATE
ThandieNewton_2011G@711.07:712.77 DESTROY MARINE LIFE
ThandieNewton_2011G@713.03:715.55 AND USE RAPE AS A WEAPON OF WAR
ThandieNewton_2011G@717.04:719.17 SO HERE 'S A NOTE TO SELF
ThandieNewton_2011G@724.9:729.05 AND OCEANS WILL CONTINUE TO SURGE THROUGH THE CRACKS
ThandieNewton_2011G@739.32:742.04 WITH THE EARTH AND EVERY OTHER LIVING THING
ThandieNewton_2011G@742.38:748.03 WE 'VE JUST BEEN INSANELY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LIVE WITH EACH OTHER BILLIONS OF EACH OTHER
ThandieNewton_2011G@750.36:753.73 OUR CRAZY SELVES ARE LIVING WITH EACH OTHER
ThandieNewton_2011G@753.77:757.12 AND PERPETUATING AN EPIDEMIC OF DISCONNECTION
ThandieNewton_2011G@758.7:760.49 LET 'S LIVE WITH EACH OTHER
ThandieNewton_2011G@772.62:776.59 OUR CONNECTION TO THE INFINITE AND EVERY OTHER LIVING THING
ThandieNewton_2011G@776.89:779.04 WE KNEW IT FROM THE DAY WE WERE BORN
ThandieNewton_2011G@779.76:784.06 LET 'S NOT BE FREAKED OUT BY OUR BOUNTIFUL NOTHINGNESS
ThandieNewton_2011G@784.11:787.52 IT 'S MORE A REALITY THAN THE ONES OUR SELVES HAVE CREATED
ThandieNewton_2011G@788.31:790.65 IMAGINE WHAT KIND OF EXISTENCE
ThandieNewton_2011G@796.43:799.41 APPRECIATE THE PRIVILEGE OF LIFE
ThandieNewton_2011G@799.97:802.72 AND MARVEL AT WHAT COMES NEXT
ThandieNewton_2011G@803.88:806.97 SIMPLE AWARENESS IS WHERE IT BEGINS
ThandieNewton_2011G@807.75:809.34 THANK YOU FOR LISTENING
