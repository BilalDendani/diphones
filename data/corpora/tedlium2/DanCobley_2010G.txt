DanCobley_2010G SO I WORK IN MARKETING WHICH I LOVE BUT MY FIRST PASSION WAS PHYSICS
DanCobley_2010G SO HE TAUGHT ME THAT PHYSICS IS COOL
DanCobley_2010G AT SCHOOL
DanCobley_2010G OKAY LOTS OF YOU SO HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BRING BACK SOME HAPPY OR POSSIBLY SOME SLIGHTLY DISTURBING MEMORIES SO PHYSICS AND MARKETING
DanCobley_2010G THE FORCE EQUALS MASS
DanCobley_2010G THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS TURKISH AIRLINES SHOULD HAVE STUDIED A BIT MORE
DanCobley_2010G BUT IF WE REARRANGE THIS FORMULA QUICKLY WE CAN GET TO ACCELERATION EQUALS FORCE OVER MASS
DanCobley_2010G WHICH MEANS THAT FOR A LARGER PARTICLE A LARGER MASS IT REQUIRES MORE FORCE TO CHANGE IT'S DIRECTION
DanCobley_2010G IT'S THE SAME WITH BRANDS
DanCobley_2010G THE MORE MASSIVE A BRAND THE MORE BAGGAGE IT HAS
DanCobley_2010G THE MORE FORCE IS NEEDED TO CHANGE ITS
DanCobley_2010G KNOCKS THE PARTICLE SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS BEFORE YOU LOOKED AT IT
DanCobley_2010G THE ACT OF MEASUREMENT CHANGES IT
DanCobley_2010G AND YET MCDONALD 'S SELLS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF BURGERS EVERY YEAR
DanCobley_2010G THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON ACCOMPANIED SHOPS IN SUPERMARKETS WHO STUFF THEIR TROLLEYS FULL OF FRESH GREEN VEGETABLES AND FRUIT BUT DON'T SHOP LIKE THAT ANY OTHER DAY
DanCobley_2010G THE SCIENCE NO SORRY THE MARKETING IS GETTING EASIER LUCKILY WITH NOW BETTER POINT OF SALE TRACKING MORE DIGITAL MEDIA CONSUMPTION YOU CAN MEASURE MORE WHAT CONSUMERS ACTUALLY DO RATHER THAN WHAT THEY SAY THEY DO
DanCobley_2010G SO THE PHYSICS IS YOU CAN NEVER ACCURATELY AND EXACTLY MEASURE A PARTICLE BECAUSE THE OBSERVATION CHANGES IT
DanCobley_2010G THE MARKETING IS THE MESSAGE FOR MARKETING IS THAT TRY TO MEASURE WHAT CONSUMERS ACTUALLY DO RATHER THAN WHAT THEY SAY
DanCobley_2010G NEXT THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD
DanCobley_2010G HAD DOZENS OF DATA POINTS TO SUPPORT HIS THEORY THAT THE PLANETS WOULD ROTATE AROUND THE EARTH IT ONLY TOOK ONE ROBUST OBSERVATION FROM COPERNICUS TO BLOW THAT IDEA OUT OF THE WATER
DanCobley_2010G THEY SPENT MILLIONS OF POUNDS OVER MANY YEARS BUILDING UP ITS CREDENTIALS AS AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY BRAND
DanCobley_2010G THINK ABOUT
DanCobley_2010G IT WAS FOR A LONG TIME REVERED AS THE MOST RELIABLE OF CARS
DanCobley_2010G AND THEN THEY HAD THE BIG RECALL INCIDENT
DanCobley_2010G SO THE PHYSICS IS THAT YOU CANNOT PROVE A HYPOTHESIS BUT IT'S EASY TO DISPROVE IT ANY HYPOTHESIS IS SHAKY AND THE MARKETING IS THAT NOT MATTER
DanCobley_2010G HOW MUCH YOU'VE INVESTED IN YOUR BRAND ONE BAD WEEK CAN UNDERMINE DECADES OF GOOD WORK SO BE REALLY CAREFUL TO TRY AND AVOID THE SCREW UPS THAT CAN UNDERMINE YOUR BRAND
DanCobley_2010G THE SAME IS TRUE OF MARKETING
DanCobley_2010G IF WE GO BACK TWENTY YEARS THE ONE MESSAGE PRETTY MUCH CONTROLLED BY ONE MARKETING MANAGER COULD PRETTY MUCH DEFINE A BRAND
DanCobley_2010G WHERE WE ARE TODAY THINGS HAVE CHANGED YOU CAN GET A STRONG BRAND IMAGE
DanCobley_2010G BUT THEN YOU LOSE CONTROL OF IT
DanCobley_2010G WITH THE KIND OF DIGITAL
DanCobley_2010G YOUR BRAND STARTS BEING DISPERSED
DanCobley_2010G IT'S OUT OF YOUR CONTROL
DanCobley_2010G IT MAKES THIS DISTRIBUTION OF ENERGY A DEMOCRATIZING FORCE WHICH IS ULTIMATELY GOOD FOR YOUR BRAND
DanCobley_2010G SO THE LESSON FROM PHYSICS IS THAT ENTROPY WILL ALWAYS INCREASE IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL LAW THE MESSAGE FOR MARKETING IS THAT YOUR BRAND IS MORE DISPERSED YOU CAN'T FIGHT IT SO EMBRACE IT AND FIND A WAY TO WORK WITH IT
DanCobley_2010G SO TO CLOSE MY TEACHER MISTER VUTTER TOLD ME THAT PHYSICS IS COOL
DanCobley_2010G AND HOPEFULLY I'VE CONVINCED YOU THAT PHYSICS CAN TEACH ALL OF US EVEN IN THE WORLD OF MARKETING SOMETHING SPECIAL THANK YOU
