RitaPierson_2013S BOTH MY PARENTS WERE EDUCATORS MY MATERNAL GRANDPARENTS WERE EDUCATORS
RitaPierson_2013S AND FOR THE PAST FORTY YEARS I 'VE DONE THE SAME THING AND SO NEEDLESS TO SAY OVER THOSE YEARS I 'VE HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT EDUCATION REFORM FROM A LOT OF PERSPECTIVES SOME OF THOSE REFORMS HAVE BEEN GOOD SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN NOT SO GOOD
RitaPierson_2013S AND WE KNOW WHY KIDS DROP OUT WE KNOW WHY KIDS DON 'T LEARN IT 'S EITHER POVERTY LOW ATTENDANCE NEGATIVE PEER INFLUENCES WE KNOW WHY BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEVER DISCUSS OR WE RARELY DISCUSS IS THE VALUE AND IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN CONNECTION
RitaPierson_2013S SAYS THAT NO SIGNIFICANT LEARNING CAN OCCUR WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER SAYS ALL LEARNING IS UNDERSTANDING RELATIONSHIPS
RitaPierson_2013S EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY A TEACHER OR AN ADULT
RitaPierson_2013S WELL I SAID TO HER YOU KNOW KIDS DON 'T LEARN FROM PEOPLE THEY DON 'T LIKE
RitaPierson_2013S AND KIDS CAN BE CRUEL AND SO SHE KEPT THOSE THINGS IN HER DESK AND YEARS LATER AFTER SHE RETIRED
RitaPierson_2013S I WATCHED SOME OF THOSE SAME KIDS COME THROUGH AND SAY TO HER YOU KNOW MS WALKER YOU MADE A DIFFERENCE IN MY LIFE
RitaPierson_2013S OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT COULD NEVER DISAPPEAR
RitaPierson_2013S CAN WE STAND TO HAVE MORE RELATIONSHIPS ABSOLUTELY WILL YOU LIKE ALL YOUR CHILDREN
RitaPierson_2013S IS THIS JOB TOUGH YOU BETCHA
RitaPierson_2013S OH GOD YOU BETCHA BUT IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE
RitaPierson_2013S WE CAN DO THIS WE 'RE EDUCATORS WE 'RE BORN TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE THANK YOU
