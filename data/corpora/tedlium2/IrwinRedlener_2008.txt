IrwinRedlener_2008@13.26:20.82 SO A BIG QUESTION THAT WE'RE FACING NOW AND HAVE BEEN FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW ARE WE AT RISK OF A NUCLEAR ATTACK
IrwinRedlener_2008@22.20:29.85 A BIGGER QUESTION THAT'S PROBABLY ACTUALLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT IS THE NOTION OF PERMANENTLY ELIMINATING
IrwinRedlener_2008@30.14:42.36 THE POSSIBILITY OF A NUCLEAR ATTACK ELIMINATING THE THREAT ALTOGETHER AND I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A CASE TO YOU THAT OVER THE YEARS SINCE WE FIRST DEVELOPED ATOMIC WEAPONRY UNTIL THIS VERY MOMENT
IrwinRedlener_2008@42.72:50.88 WE'VE ACTUALLY LIVED IN A DANGEROUS NUCLEAR WORLD THAT'S CHARACTERIZED BY TWO PHASES WHICH I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH WITH YOU RIGHT NOW
IrwinRedlener_2008@61.22:70.50 WE WOULD USE THE POWER OF THE ATOM TO END THE ATROCITIES AND THE HORROR OF THIS UNENDING WORLD WAR II THAT WE'D BEEN INVOLVED IN IN EUROPE AND IN THE PACIFIC
IrwinRedlener_2008@105.90:112.68 WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY TIME OF A BUILDUP OF A NUCLEAR ARSENAL THAT NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE IMAGINED
IrwinRedlener_2008@122.08:130.11 SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND NUCLEAR WARHEADS AND SEVEN MEMBERS OF SOMETHING THAT CAME TO BE KNOWN AS THE NUCLEAR CLUB
IrwinRedlener_2008@159.09:169.81 AND WE DROPPED THE NUMBER OF NUCLEAR WARHEADS IN THE WORLD TO ABOUT A TOTAL OF TWENTY ONE THOUSAND IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT NUMBER TO DEAL WITH BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE 'VE QUOTE UNQUOTE DECOMMISSIONED SOME OF THE WARHEADS
IrwinRedlener_2008@179.35:185.84 BUT WE ALSO IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME ADDED TWO MORE MEMBERS TO THE NUCLEAR CLUB PAKISTAN AND NORTH KOREA
IrwinRedlener_2008@186.30:199.32 SO WE STAND TODAY WITH A STILL FULLY ARMED NUCLEAR ARSENAL AMONG MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD BUT A VERY DIFFERENT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES SO I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT A NUCLEAR THREAT STORY IN TWO CHAPTERS
IrwinRedlener_2008@214.32:222.09 VERY FRAGILE STANDOFF AND BASICALLY WE LIVED FOR ALL THOSE YEARS AND SOME MIGHT ARGUE THAT WE STILL DO
IrwinRedlener_2008@222.45:232.86 IN A SITUATION OF BEING ON THE BRINK LITERALLY OF AN APOCALYPTIC PLANETARY CALAMITY IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT WE ACTUALLY LIVED THROUGH ALL THAT
IrwinRedlener_2008@233.14:241.84 WE WERE TOTALLY DEPENDENT DURING THOSE YEARS ON THIS AMAZING ACRONYM WHICH IS MAD IT STANDS FOR MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION SO IT MEANT IF
IrwinRedlener_2008@242.65:251.06 IF YOU ATTACKED US WE WOULD ATTACK YOU VIRTUALLY SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THE END RESULT WOULD BE A DESTRUCTION OF YOUR COUNTRY AND MINE
IrwinRedlener_2008@251.38:263.89 SO THE THREAT OF MY OWN DESTRUCTION KEPT ME FROM LAUNCHING A NUCLEAR ATTACK ON YOU THAT'S THE WAY WE LIVED AND THE DANGER OF THAT OF COURSE IS THAT A MISREADING OF A RADAR SCREEN
IrwinRedlener_2008@264.20:274.86 COULD ACTUALLY CAUSE A COUNTER LAUNCH EVEN THOUGH THE FIRST COUNTRY HAD NOT ACTUALLY LAUNCHED ANYTHING DURING THIS CHAPTER ONE THERE WAS A HIGH LEVEL OF PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF NUCLEAR
IrwinRedlener_2008@275.42:283.39 CATASTROPHE AND AN INDELIBLE IMAGE WAS IMPLANTED IN OUR COLLECTIVE MINDS THAT IN FACT A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST WOULD BE
IrwinRedlener_2008@284.19:290.65 GLOBALLY DESTRUCTIVE AND COULD IN SOME WAYS MEAN THE END OF CIVILIZATION AS WE KNOW IT SO THIS WAS CHAPTER ONE
IrwinRedlener_2008@291.14:304.31 NOW THE ODD THING IS THAT EVEN THOUGH WE KNEW THAT THERE WOULD BE THAT KIND OF CIVILIZATION OBLITERATION WE ENGAGED IN AMERICA IN A SERIES AND IN FACT IN THE SOVIET UNION IN A SERIES OF RESPONSE PLANNING
IrwinRedlener_2008@333.15:333.51 THE
IrwinRedlener_2008@342.70:351.57 WAS BASICALLY AN ATTEMPT TO TEACH OUR SCHOOLCHILDREN THAT IF WE DID GET ENGAGED IN A NUCLEAR CONFRONTATION AND ATOMIC WAR THEN
IrwinRedlener_2008@351.92:362.60 WE WANTED OUR SCHOOL CHILDREN TO KIND OF BASICALLY DUCK AND COVER THAT WAS THE PRINCIPLE YOU THERE WOULD BE A NUCLEAR CONFLAGRATION ABOUT TO HIT US AND IF YOU GET UNDER YOUR DESK THINGS WOULD BE OK
IrwinRedlener_2008@365.96:372.42 I DIDN'T DO ALL THAT WELL IN PSYCHIATRY IN MEDICAL SCHOOL BUT I WAS INTERESTED AND I THINK THIS WAS SERIOUSLY DELUSIONAL
IrwinRedlener_2008@384.99:397.24 OR AS MANY TEENAGERS FOUND OUT A VERY VERY SAFE PLACE FOR A LITTLE PRIVACY WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND AND ACTUALLY SO THERE ARE MULTIPLE USES OF THE BOMB SHELTERS OR YOU COULD BUY A PREFABRICATED BOMB SHELTER AND YOU COULD SIMPLY BURY IN THE GROUND
IrwinRedlener_2008@397.90:408.99 THE BOMB SHELTERS AT THAT POINT LET 'S SAY YOU BOUGHT A PREFAB ONE IT WOULD BE A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS MAYBE UP TO FIVE HUNDRED IF YOU GOT A FANCY ONE YET WHAT PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS DO YOU THINK EVER HAD A BOMB SHELTER IN THEIR HOUSE WHAT PERCENTAGE LIVED IN A HOUSE
IrwinRedlener_2008@411.08:421.52 LESS THAN TWO PERCENT ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT OF THE POPULATION AS FAR AS ANYONE KNOWS DID ANYTHING EITHER MAKING A SPACE IN THEIR BASEMENT OR ACTUALLY BUILDING A BOMB SHELTER
IrwinRedlener_2008@433.69:441.86 AND ONE OF THE GREATEST GOVERNMENTAL DELUSIONS OF ALL TIME WAS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY
IrwinRedlener_2008@442.13:449.48 FEMA AS WE NOW KNOW AND ARE WELL AWARE OF THEIR BEHAVIORS FROM KATRINA HERE IS THEIR FIRST BIG PUBLIC
IrwinRedlener_2008@462.83:471.05 THAT THE SOVIETS WERE GOING TO ATTACK US SO THE GOAL WAS TO EVACUATE THE TARGET CITIES WE WOULD MOVE PEOPLE OUT OF THE TARGET CITIES INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE
IrwinRedlener_2008@498.62:506.63 TAKE OUT SITES WHERE PEOPLE WERE GOING THIS WAS WHAT APPARENTLY AS IT TURNS OUT WAS BEHIND ALL THIS IT WAS JUST REALLY REALLY FRIGHTENING
IrwinRedlener_2008@507.00:520.90 THE MAIN POINT HERE IS WE WERE DEALING WITH A COMPLETE DISCONNECT FROM REALITY THE CIVIL DEFENSE PROGRAMS WERE DISCONNECTED FROM THE REALITY OF WHAT WE'D SEEN IN ALL OUT NUCLEAR WAR SO ORGANIZATIONS LIKE PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
IrwinRedlener_2008@532.11:545.68 SO NO POSSIBILITY OF MEDICAL RESPONSE TO OR MEANINGFUL PREPAREDNESS FOR ALL OUT NUCLEAR WAR SO WE HAD TO PREVENT NUCLEAR WAR IF WE EXPECTED TO SURVIVE THIS DISCONNECT WAS NEVER ACTUALLY RESOLVED
IrwinRedlener_2008@567.86:581.08 THROUGH THE PRESENT TIME EMPHASIZED BY THE ATTACKS OF TWO THOUSAND AND ONE THE IDEA OF AN ALL OUT NUCLEAR WAR HAS DIMINISHED AND THE IDEA OF A SINGLE EVENT ACT OF NUCLEAR TERRORISM IS WHAT WE HAVE INSTEAD
IrwinRedlener_2008@582.12:592.58 ALTHOUGH THE SCENARIO HAS CHANGED VERY CONSIDERABLY THE FACT IS THAT WE HAVEN'T CHANGED OUR MENTAL IMAGE OF WHAT A NUCLEAR WAR MEANS SO I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT ARE IN JUST A SECOND
IrwinRedlener_2008@593.15:603.48 SO WHAT IS A NUCLEAR TERROR THREAT AND THERE'S FOUR KEY INGREDIENTS TO DESCRIBING THAT FIRST THING IS THAT THE GLOBAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE STOCKPILES THAT I SHOWED YOU IN THOSE ORIGINAL MAPS
IrwinRedlener_2008@610.61:621.09 THERE ARE MANY MANY SITES WHERE WARHEADS ARE STORED AND IN FACT LOTS OF SITES WHERE FISSIONABLE MATERIALS LIKE HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM AND PLUTONIUM ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT SAFE
IrwinRedlener_2008@630.13:642.20 THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY DOCUMENTED ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE CASES OF NUCLEAR THEFT EIGHTEEN OF WHICH INVOLVED HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM OR PLUTONIUM THE KEY INGREDIENTS TO MAKE A NUCLEAR WEAPON
IrwinRedlener_2008@657.41:665.36 RUSSIAN FACILITIES HOW MUCH OF THAT DO YOU THINK IT WOULD TAKE TO ACTUALLY BUILD A TEN KILOTON BOMB WELL YOU NEED ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE
IrwinRedlener_2008@665.65:668.98 POUNDS OF IT SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU
IrwinRedlener_2008@672.04:676.45 WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO HOLD SEVENTY FIVE POUNDS OF HIGHLY
IrwinRedlener_2008@678.23:682.70 THIS IS NOT A PRODUCT PLACEMENT IT'S JUST IN FACT IF I WAS COCA COLA I'D BE PRETTY DISTRESSED ABOUT THIS
IrwinRedlener_2008@685.53:686.22 BUT
IrwinRedlener_2008@687.82:701.02 BUT BASICALLY THIS IS IT THIS IS WHAT YOU WOULD NEED TO STEAL OR BUY OUT OF THAT ONE HUNDRED METRIC TON STOCKPILE THAT'S RELATIVELY INSECURE TO CREATE THE TYPE OF BOMB THAT WAS USED IN HIROSHIMA
IrwinRedlener_2008@701.74:712.29 NOW YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT PLUTONIUM AS ANOTHER FISSIONABLE MATERIAL THAT YOU MIGHT USE IN A BOMB THAT YOU'D NEED TEN TO THIRTEEN POUNDS OF PLUTONIUM NOW PLUTONIUM TEN TO THIRTEEN POUNDS
IrwinRedlener_2008@713.88:721.98 THIS THIS IS ENOUGH PLUTONIUM TO CREATE A NAGASAKI SIZE ATOMIC WEAPON NOW
IrwinRedlener_2008@722.42:729.53 THIS SITUATION ALREADY I YOU KNOW I DON'T REALLY LIKE THINKING ABOUT THIS ALTHOUGH SOMEHOW I GOT MYSELF A JOB WHERE I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT SO
IrwinRedlener_2008@730.13:744.21 THE POINT IS THAT WE'RE VERY VERY INSECURE IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING THIS MATERIAL THE SECOND THING IS WHAT ABOUT THE KNOW HOW AND THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSY ABOUT WHETHER TERROR ORGANIZATIONS HAVE THE KNOW HOW TO ACTUALLY
IrwinRedlener_2008@744.77:758.72 MAKE A NUCLEAR WEAPON WELL THERE'S A LOT OF KNOW HOW OUT THERE THERE'S AN UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT OF KNOWHOW OUT THERE THERE'S DETAILED INFORMATION ON HOW TO ASSEMBLE A NUCLEAR WEAPON FROM PARTS THERE'S BOOKS ABOUT HOW TO BUILD A NUCLEAR BOMB
IrwinRedlener_2008@759.12:773.78 THERE ARE PLANS FOR HOW TO CREATE A TERROR FARM WHERE YOU COULD ACTUALLY MANUFACTURE AND DEVELOP ALL THE COMPONENTS AND ASSEMBLE IT ALL OF THIS INFORMATION IS RELATIVELY AVAILABLE IF YOU HAVE AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IN PHYSICS I WOULD SUGGEST
IrwinRedlener_2008@774.22:783.27 ALTHOUGH I DON 'T SO MAYBE IT'S NOT EVEN TRUE BUT SOMETHING CLOSE TO THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU WITH THE INFORMATION THAT'S CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO ACTUALLY BUILD A NUCLEAR WEAPON
IrwinRedlener_2008@784.59:792.75 THE THIRD ELEMENT OF THE NUCLEAR TERROR THREAT IS THAT WHO WOULD ACTUALLY DO SUCH A THING WELL WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW
IrwinRedlener_2008@793.03:802.01 IS A LEVEL OF TERRORISM THAT INVOLVES INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HIGHLY ORGANIZED THEY ARE VERY DEDICATED AND COMMITTED THEY ARE STATELESS SOMEBODY ONCE SAID
IrwinRedlener_2008@803.02:811.74 DOES NOT HAVE A RETURN ADDRESS SO IF THEY ATTACK US WITH A NUCLEAR WEAPON WHAT'S THE RESPONSE AND TO WHOM IS THE RESPONSE AND THEY'RE RETALIATION PROOF
IrwinRedlener_2008@812.47:819.70 SINCE THERE IS NO REAL RETRIBUTION POSSIBLE THAT WOULD MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE SINCE THERE ARE PEOPLE WILLING TO ACTUALLY GIVE UP THEIR LIVES
IrwinRedlener_2008@820.02:828.92 IN ORDER TO DO A LOT OF DAMAGE TO US IT BECOMES APPARENT THAT THE WHOLE NOTION OF THIS MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION WOULD NOT WORK HERE IS
IrwinRedlener_2008@830.30:840.07 AND SULAIMAN WAS A KEY LIEUTENANT OF OSAMA BIN LADEN HE WROTE MANY MANY TIMES STATEMENTS TO THIS EFFECT WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO KILL FOUR MILLION AMERICANS TWO MILLION OF WHOM SHOULD BE CHILDREN
IrwinRedlener_2008@840.56:853.51 AND WE DON'T HAVE TO GO OVERSEAS TO FIND PEOPLE WILLING TO DO HARM FOR WHATEVER THEIR REASONS MCVEIGH AND NICHOLS AND THE OKLAHOMA CITY ATTACK IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOMEGROWN TERRORISTS WHAT IF THEY HAD GOTTEN THEIR HANDS ON A NUCLEAR WEAPON
IrwinRedlener_2008@853.84:859.84 THE FOURTH ELEMENT IS THAT THE HIGH VALUE U S TARGETS ARE ACCESSIBLE SOFT AND PLENTIFUL
IrwinRedlener_2008@870.34:878.22 IS A VERY GOOD INDICATOR OF HOW LITTLE PREPARED THE UNITED STATES IS FOR ANY KIND OF MAJOR ATTACK SEVEN MILLION
IrwinRedlener_2008@878.59:886.87 SHIP CARGO CONTAINERS COME INTO THE UNITED STATES EVERY YEAR FIVE TO SEVEN PERCENT ONLY ARE INSPECTED FIVE TO SEVEN PERCENT
IrwinRedlener_2008@887.42:895.16 THIS IS ALEXANDER LEBED WHO WAS A GENERAL THAT WORKED WITH YELTSIN WHO TALKED ABOUT AND PRESENTED TO CONGRESS
IrwinRedlener_2008@895.64:902.33 THIS IDEA THAT THE RUSSIANS HAD DEVELOPED THESE SUITCASE BOMBS THEY WERE VERY LOW YIELD ZERO POINT ONE TO ONE
IrwinRedlener_2008@903.40:910.43 HIROSHIMA WAS AROUND THIRTEEN KILOTONS BUT ENOUGH TO DO AN UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE AND LEBED CAME TO THE UNITED STATES
IrwinRedlener_2008@910.84:923.75 AND TOLD US THAT MANY MANY MORE THAN EIGHTY OF THE SUITCASE BOMBS WERE ACTUALLY NOT ACCOUNTABLE AND THEY LOOK LIKE THIS THEY'RE BASICALLY VERY SIMPLE ARRANGEMENTS YOU PUT THE ELEMENTS INTO A SUITCASE IT BECOMES VERY PORTABLE
IrwinRedlener_2008@948.43:959.30 AND FOR FIFTY BUCKS OR SO YOU RENT A TRUCK THAT'S GOT THE RIGHT CAPACITY AND YOU TAKE YOUR BOMB AND YOU PUT IT IN THE TRUCK AND YOU'RE READY TO GO IT COULD HAPPEN BUT WHAT IT WOULD MEAN AND
IrwinRedlener_2008@969.88:979.21 A NUCLEAR WEAPON BEING USED BY A TERRORIST IS KIDDING THEMSELVES I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DEAL WITH THIS WORK IN GENERAL THINK
IrwinRedlener_2008@979.95:988.93 ALMOST INEVITABLE UNLESS WE DO CERTAIN THINGS TO REALLY TRY TO DEFUSE THE RISK LIKE BETTER INTERDICTION BETTER PREVENTION BETTER FIXING YOU KNOW BETTER
IrwinRedlener_2008@997.73:1006.15 WE ACTUALLY COULD END UP SEEING A NUCLEAR DETONATION IN ONE OF OUR CITIES I DON'T THINK WE WOULD SEE AN ALL OUT NUCLEAR WAR ANY TIME SOON
IrwinRedlener_2008@1006.38:1017.84 ALTHOUGH EVEN THAT IS NOT COMPLETELY OFF THE TABLE THERE'S STILL ENOUGH NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE ARSENALS OF THE SUPERPOWERS TO DESTROY THE EARTH MANY MANY TIMES OVER THERE ARE FLASH POINTS IN INDIA AND PAKISTAN
IrwinRedlener_2008@1018.23:1026.49 IN THE MIDDLE EAST IN NORTH KOREA OTHER PLACES WHERE THE USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHILE INITIALLY LOCALLY COULD
IrwinRedlener_2008@1027.10:1036.53 VERY RAPIDLY GO INTO A SITUATION WHERE WE'D BE FACING ALL OUT NUCLEAR WAR VERY UNSETTLING OK
IrwinRedlener_2008@1037.32:1041.20 BACK IN MY TRUCK AND WE DROVE OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE WE'RE COMING DOWN
IrwinRedlener_2008@1042.94:1047.19 AND WE BRING THAT TRUCK THAT YOU JUST SAW SOMEWHERE IN HERE IN THE FINANCIAL
IrwinRedlener_2008@1060.21:1067.91 THIS IS A TEN KILOTON BOMB SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN WAS USED IN HIROSHIMA AND I WANT TO JUST
IrwinRedlener_2008@1068.23:1072.05 THIS BY JUST GIVING YOU SOME INFORMATION I THINK NEWS YOU COULD USE KIND OF CONCEPT HERE
IrwinRedlener_2008@1072.83:1083.54 SO FIRST OF ALL THIS WOULD BE HORRIFIC BEYOND ANYTHING WE CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE THIS IS THE ULTIMATE AND IF YOU'RE IN THE HALF MILE RADIUS OF WHERE THIS BOMB WENT OFF
IrwinRedlener_2008@1083.77:1094.33 YOU HAVE A NINETY PERCENT CHANCE OF NOT MAKING IT IF YOU'RE RIGHT WHERE THE BOMB WENT OFF YOU WILL BE VAPORIZED AND THAT'S I'M JUST TELLING YOU THIS IS NOT GOOD YOU ASSUME THAT
IrwinRedlener_2008@1133.03:1139.76 WHAT I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON AS I COME TO CONCLUSION HERE IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU IF YOU'RE IN HERE
IrwinRedlener_2008@1140.14:1147.81 WELL IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OLD DAYS OF AN ALL OUT NUCLEAR ATTACK YOU UP HERE ARE AS DEAD AS THE PEOPLE HERE SO IT WAS A MOOT POINT
IrwinRedlener_2008@1148.15:1159.42 MY POINT NOW THOUGH IS THAT THERE IS A LOT THAT WE COULD DO FOR YOU WHO ARE IN HERE IF YOU'VE SURVIVED THE INITIAL BLAST YOU HAVE WHEN THE BLAST GOES OFF AND BY THE WAY IF IT EVER COMES UP DON'T LOOK AT IT
IrwinRedlener_2008@1160.24:1168.07 IF YOU LOOK AT IT YOU'RE GOING TO BE BLIND EITHER TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY SO IF THERE'S ANY WAY THAT YOU CAN AVOID LIKE AVERT YOUR EYES THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING
IrwinRedlener_2008@1169.06:1181.47 IF YOU FIND YOURSELF ALIVE BUT YOU'RE IN THE VICINITY OF A NUCLEAR WEAPON YOU HAVE THAT'S GONE OFF YOU HAVE TEN TO TWENTY MINUTES DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND EXACTLY WHERE IT WENT OFF TO GET OUT OF THE WAY
IrwinRedlener_2008@1182.19:1193.27 BEFORE A LETHAL AMOUNT OF RADIATION COMES STRAIGHT DOWN FROM THE MUSHROOM CLOUD THAT GOES UP IN THAT TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES ALL YOU HAVE TO DO AND I MEAN THIS SERIOUSLY IS GO ABOUT A MILE
IrwinRedlener_2008@1194.25:1203.61 AWAY FROM THE BLAST AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THIS IS I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU NOW SOME FALLOUT PLUMES WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES IT COMES STRAIGHT DOWN WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS LETHAL RADIATION IS GOING OUT
IrwinRedlener_2008@1203.97:1213.11 WITH PREVAILING WINDS AND IT'S MOSTLY IN THIS PARTICULAR DIRECTION IT'S GOING NORTH EAST AND IF YOU'RE IN THIS VICINITY YOU'VE GOT TO GET AWAY SO YOU'RE FEELING THE
IrwinRedlener_2008@1222.44:1230.07 ABLE TO SEE WHERE THE BLAST WAS IN FRONT OF YOU YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF THERE IF YOU DON'T GET OUT OF THERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE EXPOSED TO LETHAL RADIATION IN VERY SHORT ORDER
IrwinRedlener_2008@1230.35:1237.89 IF YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF THERE WE WANT YOU TO GO INTO A SHELTER AND STAY THERE NOW IN A SHELTER IN AN URBAN AREA MEANS YOU
IrwinRedlener_2008@1238.46:1250.99 HAVE TO BE EITHER IN A BASEMENT AS DEEP AS POSSIBLE OR YOU HAVE TO BE ON A FLOOR ON A HIGH FLOOR IF IT'S A GROUND BURST EXPLOSION WHICH IT WOULD BE HIGHER THAN THE NINTH FLOOR SO YOU HAVE TO BE TENTH FLOOR OR HIGHER OR IN THE BASEMENT
IrwinRedlener_2008@1261.44:1271.03 THE NEXT FEW DAYS TO A WEEK THERE WILL BE A RADIATION CLOUD AGAIN GOING WITH THE WIND AND SETTLING DOWN FOR ANOTHER FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MILES OUT IN THIS CASE OVER LONG ISLAND
IrwinRedlener_2008@1271.48:1282.98 AND IF YOU'RE IN THE DIRECT FALLOUT ZONE HERE YOU REALLY HAVE TO EITHER BE SHELTERED OR YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF THERE AND THAT'S CLEAR BUT IF YOU ARE SHELTERED YOU CAN ACTUALLY SURVIVE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING
IrwinRedlener_2008@1302.49:1311.05 BUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THERE ISN'T ONE SINGLE AMERICAN CITY THAT HAS DONE EFFECTIVE PLANS TO DEAL WITH A NUCLEAR DETONATION DISASTER
IrwinRedlener_2008@1326.47:1340.75 AND WE'RE TRYING TO TELL THEM IT'S NOT FUTILE WE CAN CHANGE THE SURVIVAL RATES BY DOING SOME COMMONSENSICAL THINGS SO THE GOAL HERE IS TO MINIMIZE FATALITIES AND I JUST WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE PERSONAL POINTS THAT I THINK YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN THE KEY TO
IrwinRedlener_2008@1341.20:1346.88 A NUCLEAR BLAST IS GETTING OUT AND NOT GOING INTO HARM 'S WAY
IrwinRedlener_2008@1347.61:1355.86 THAT'S BASICALLY ALL WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HERE AND THE FARTHER YOU ARE AWAY IN DISTANCE THE LONGER IT IS IN TIME FROM THE INITIAL BLAST
IrwinRedlener_2008@1356.19:1364.96 AND THE MORE SEPARATION BETWEEN YOU AND THE OUTSIDE ATMOSPHERE THE BETTER SO SEPARATION HOPEFULLY WITH DIRT OR CONCRETE OR BEING IN A BASEMENT
IrwinRedlener_2008@1365.64:1375.19 DISTANCE AND TIME IS WHAT WILL SAVE YOU SO HERE 'S WHAT YOU DO FIRST OF ALL AS I SAID DON'T STARE AT THE LIGHT FLASH IF YOU CAN I DON'T KNOW YOU COULD POSSIBLY RESIST DOING THAT BUT LET 'S ASSUME THEORETICALLY YOU WANT TO DO THAT
IrwinRedlener_2008@1385.24:1397.07 AND YOU WANT TO GET UNDER SOMETHING SO THAT YOU'RE NOT INJURED OR KILLED BY OBJECTS IF THAT'S AT ALL POSSIBLE YOU WANT TO GET AWAY FROM THE INITIAL FALLOUT MUSHROOM CLOUD I SAID IN JUST A FEW MINUTES AND SHELTER AND PLACE YOU WANT TO MOVE DOWNWIND
IrwinRedlener_2008@1397.42:1404.35 OR CROSSWIND FOR ONE POINT TWO MILES YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE OUT THERE AND YOU SEE BUILDINGS HORRIBLY DESTROYED AND DOWN IN THAT DIRECTION
IrwinRedlener_2008@1404.61:1411.94 LESS DESTROYED HERE THEN YOU KNOW THAT IT WAS OVER THERE THE BLAST AND YOU'RE GOING THIS WAY AS LONG AS YOU'RE GOING CROSSWISE TO THE WIND
IrwinRedlener_2008@1412.77:1421.23 ONCE YOU'RE OUT AND EVACUATING YOU WANT TO KEEP AS MUCH OF YOUR SKIN YOUR MOUTH AND NOSE COVERED AS LONG AS THAT COVERING DOESN'T IMPEDE YOU MOVING AND GETTING OUT OF THERE
IrwinRedlener_2008@1421.47:1430.23 AND FINALLY YOU WANT TO GET DECONTAMINATED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND IF YOU'RE WEARING CLOTHING YOU'VE TAKEN OFF YOUR CLOTHING YOU'RE GOING TO GET SHOWERED DOWN SOME PLACE AND REMOVE THE RADIATION THAT WOULD BE
IrwinRedlener_2008@1431.71:1439.36 THAT MIGHT BE ON YOU AND THEN YOU WANT TO STAY IN SHELTER FOR FORTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS MINIMUM BUT YOU'RE GOING TO WAIT HOPEFULLY YOU'LL HAVE YOUR LITTLE WIND UP
IrwinRedlener_2008@1439.80:1446.82 BATTERY LESS RADIO AND YOU'LL BE WAITING FOR PEOPLE TO TELL YOU WHEN IT'S SAFE TO GO OUTSIDE THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IN CONCLUSION
IrwinRedlener_2008@1447.41:1460.80 NUCLEAR WAR IS LESS LIKELY THAN BEFORE BUT BY NO MEANS OUT OF THE QUESTION AND IT'S NOT SURVIVABLE NUCLEAR TERRORISM IS POSSIBLE IT MAY BE PROBABLE BUT IS SURVIVABLE AND THIS IS JACK GEIGER WHO 'S ONE OF THE HEROES OF THE U S PUBLIC HEALTH
IrwinRedlener_2008@1461.91:1472.49 COMMUNITY AND JACK SAID THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH NUCLEAR ANYTHING WHETHER IT'S WAR OR TERRORISM IS ABOLITION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND YOU WANT SOMETHING TO WORK ON ONCE YOU'VE FIXED GLOBAL WARMING
IrwinRedlener_2008@1472.95:1485.51 I URGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS UNACCEPTABLE INHUMANE REALITY OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN OUR WORLD NOW THIS IS MY FAVORITE CIVIL DEFENSE SLIDE AND
IrwinRedlener_2008@1494.92:1505.87 SENT TO ME BY SOMEBODY WHO IS AN AFICIONADO OF CIVIL DEFENSE PROCEDURES BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT AMERICA 'S GONE THROUGH A VERY HARD TIME WE'VE NOT BEEN FOCUSED WE'VE NOT DONE WHAT WE HAD TO DO
IrwinRedlener_2008@1506.22:1507.83 AND NOW WE'RE FACING THE POTENTIAL OF
