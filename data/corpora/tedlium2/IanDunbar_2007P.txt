IanDunbar_2007P DOGS HAVE INTERESTS THEY HAVE INTERESTS SNIFFING EACH OTHER CHASING SQUIRRELS AND IF WE DON'T MAKE THAT A REWARD IN TRAINING THAT WILL BE A DISTRACTION
IanDunbar_2007P IT'S ALWAYS SORT OF STRUCK ME AS REALLY A SCARY THOUGHT THAT IF YOU SEE A DOG IN A PARK AND THE OWNER IS CALLING IT
IanDunbar_2007P THE OWNER SAYS YOU KNOW PUPPY COME HERE COME HERE AND THE DOG THINKS HMM INTERESTING I'M SNIFFING THIS OTHER DOG 'S REAR END
IanDunbar_2007P THE OWNER 'S CALLING IT'S A DIFFICULT CHOICE RIGHT REAR END OWNER REAR END WINS I MEAN YOU LOSE YOU CANNOT COMPETE
IanDunbar_2007P WITH THE ENVIRONMENT IF YOU HAVE AN ADOLESCENT DOG 'S BRAIN SO WHEN WE TRAIN WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE DOG 'S POINT OF VIEW
IanDunbar_2007P NOW I'M HERE LARGELY BECAUSE THERE'S KIND OF A RIFT IN DOG TRAINING AT THE MOMENT THAT ON ONE SIDE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT YOU TRAIN A DOG NUMBER ONE BY MAKING UP RULES
IanDunbar_2007P HUMAN RULES WE DON'T TAKE THE DOG 'S POINT OF VIEW INTO ACCOUNT SO THE HUMAN SAYS YOU 'RE GOING TO ACT THIS WAY DAMN IT WE'RE GOING TO FORCE YOU TO ACT AGAINST YOUR WILL TO BEND TO OUR WILL THEN NUMBER TWO WE KEEP THESE RULES A SECRET FROM THE DOG
IanDunbar_2007P AND THEN NUMBER THREE NOW WE CAN PUNISH THE DOG FOR BREAKING RULES HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW EXISTED SO YOU GET A LITTLE PUPPY HE COMES HIS ONLY CRIME IS HE GREW WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE PUPPY HE PUTS HIS PAWS ON YOUR LEG
IanDunbar_2007P THAT NICE AND YOU GO OH THERE'S A GOOD BOY YOU BEND DOWN YOU PAT HIM YOU REWARD HIM FOR JUMPING UP
IanDunbar_2007P ONE MISTAKE IS HE 'S A TIBETAN MASTIFF AND A FEW MONTHS LATER HE WEIGHS YOU KNOW EIGHTY POUNDS
IanDunbar_2007P HE JUMPS UP HE GETS ALL SORTS OF ABUSE I MEAN IT IS REALLY VERY VERY SCARY THE ABUSE THAT DOGS GET SO
IanDunbar_2007P THIS WHOLE DOMINANCE ISSUE NUMBER ONE WHAT WE GET IN DOG TRAINING IS THIS MICKEY MOUSE INTERPRETATION OF A VERY COMPLICATED SOCIAL SYSTEM AND THEY TAKE THIS STUFF SERIOUSLY
IanDunbar_2007P AND WHAT YOU WILL FIND IS A VERY VERY LOW RANKING BITCH WILL QUITE EASILY KEEP A BONE AWAY FROM A HIGH RANKING MALE
IanDunbar_2007P SO WE GET IN DOG TRAINING THIS NOTION OF DOMINANCES OR OF THE ALPHA DOG I'M SURE THAT YOU'VE HEARD THIS DOGS GET SO ABUSED DOGS HORSES AND HUMANS THESE ARE THE THREE SPECIES WHICH ARE SO ABUSED IN LIFE AND THE REASON IS BUILT INTO THEIR BEHAVIOR IS
IanDunbar_2007P JUMPS UP YOU OPEN THE DOG BOOK WHAT DOES IT SAY HOLD HIS FRONT PAWS SQUEEZE HIS FRONT PAWS STAMP ON HIS HIND FEET SQUIRT HIM IN THE FACE WITH LEMON JUICE HIT HIM ON THE HEAD WITH A ROLLED UP
IanDunbar_2007P KNEE HIM IN THE CHEST FLIP HIM OVER BACKWARDS BECAUSE HE GREW AND BECAUSE HE 'S PERFORMING A BEHAVIOR YOU'VE TRAINED HIM TO DO THIS IS INSANITY I ASK OWNERS WELL HOW
IanDunbar_2007P AND PEOPLE SAY WELL I DON'T KNOW TO SIT I GUESS I SAID LET 'S TEACH HIM TO SIT AND THEN WE GIVE HIM A REASON FOR SITTING
IanDunbar_2007P BECAUSE THE FIRST STAGE IS BASICALLY TEACHING A DOG ESL I COULD SPEAK TO YOU AND SAY LAYTAY
IanDunbar_2007P ON SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN NOW WHY AREN'T YOU RESPONDING OH YOU DON'T SPEAK SWAHILI WELL I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU THE DOG DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH
IanDunbar_2007P SIT SIT SIT THEY'RE MAKING A HAND SIGNAL IN FRONT OF THE DOG 'S RECTUM FOR SOME REASON LIKE THE DOG HAS A THIRD EYE THERE IT'S INSANE
IanDunbar_2007P NO WE GO PUPPY SIT BOOM IT'S GOT IT IN SIX TO TEN TRIALS THEN WE PHASE OUT THE FOOD AS A
IanDunbar_2007P PHOENIX COME HERE TAKE THIS GO TO AND THE NAME OF MY SON JAMIE AND THE DOG CAN TAKE A NOTE AND I'VE GOT MY OWN LITTLE SEARCH AND RESCUE DOG HE'LL FIND JAMIE WHEREVER HE
IanDunbar_2007P NOT NECESSARILY NO AS I SAID IF HE 'S IN THE PARK AND THERE'S A REAR END TO SNIFF WHY COME TO THE OWNER THE DOG LIVES WITH YOU
IanDunbar_2007P THE DOG CAN GET YOU ANY TIME THE DOG CAN SNIFF YOUR BUTT IF YOU LIKE WHEN HE WANTS TO AT THE MOMENT HE 'S IN THE PARK AND YOU ARE COMPETING WITH
IanDunbar_2007P AND OTHER DOGS AND SQUIRRELS SO THE SECOND STAGE IN TRAINING IS TO TEACH THE DOG TO WANT TO DO WHAT WE WANT HIM TO DO
IanDunbar_2007P THIS IS VERY EASY WE USE THE PREMACK PRINCIPLE BASICALLY WE FOLLOW A LOW FREQUENCY BEHAVIOR ONE THE DOG DOESN'T WANT TO DO BY A HIGH FREQUENCY BEHAVIOR COMMONLY KNOWN AS A BEHAVIOR PROBLEM OR A DOG
IanDunbar_2007P HOBBY SOMETHING THE DOG DOES LIKE TO DO
IanDunbar_2007P THAT WILL THEN BECOME A REWARD FOR THE LOWER FREQUENCY BEHAVIOR SO WE GO SIT ON THE COUCH SIT TUMMY RUB SIT LOOK I THROW A TENNIS BALL
IanDunbar_2007P SAY HELLO TO THAT OTHER DOG YES WE PUT SNIFF BUTT ON QUEUE SIT SNIFF BUTT SO NOW ALL OF THESE DISTRACTIONS
IanDunbar_2007P WORKED AGAINST TRAINING NOW BECOME REWARDS THAT WORK FOR TRAINING AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IN ESSENCE IS WE'RE TEACHING THE DOG
IanDunbar_2007P KIND OF LIKE WE'RE LETTING THE DOG THINK THAT THE DOG IS TRAINING US AND I CAN IMAGINE THIS DOG YOU KNOW SPEAKING THROUGH THE FENCE TO SAY AN AKITA SAYING
IanDunbar_2007P THEY ARE SO INCREDIBLY EASY TO TRAIN THEY'RE LIKE GOLDEN RETRIEVERS ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SIT AND THEY DO EVERYTHING THEY OPEN DOORS
IanDunbar_2007P THEY DRIVE MY CAR THEY MASSAGE ME THEY WILL THROW TENNIS BALLS THEY WILL COOK FOR ME AND SERVE THE FOOD
IanDunbar_2007P IT'S LIKE IF I JUST SIT THAT'S MY COMMAND THEN I HAVE MY OWN PERSONAL DOORMAN CHAUFFEUR MASSEUSE CHEF AND WAITER
IanDunbar_2007P AND NOW THE DOG 'S REALLY HAPPY AND THIS TO ME IS ALWAYS WHAT TRAINING IS SO WE REALLY MOTIVATE THE DOG TO WANT TO DO IT SUCH THAT THE NEED FOR PUNISHMENT SELDOM COMES UP
IanDunbar_2007P NOW WE MOVE TO PHASE THREE WHEN NOW THERE'S TIMES YOU KNOW WHEN DADDY KNOWS BEST AND I HAVE A LITTLE SIGN ON MY FRIDGE AND IT SAYS BECAUSE I'M THE DADDY THAT'S WHY SORRY NO MORE EXPLANATION I 'M THE DADDY YOU'RE NOT SIT
IanDunbar_2007P AND THERE'S TIMES FOR EXAMPLE IF MY SON 'S FRIENDS LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN THE DOGS HAVE TO KNOW YOU DON'T STEP ACROSS THIS LINE
IanDunbar_2007P THIS IS A LIFE OR DEATH THING YOU LEAVE THIS THE SANCTITY OF YOUR HOUSE AND YOU COULD BE HIT ON THE
IanDunbar_2007P SO SOME THINGS WE HAVE TO LET THE DOG KNOW YOU MUSTN'T DO THIS AND SO WE HAVE TO ENFORCE BUT WITHOUT
IanDunbar_2007P OR SCARY OR NASTY IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THERE'S SEVERAL DEFINITIONS OF WHAT A PUNISHMENT IS BUT ONE DEFINITION THE MOST POPULAR IS
IanDunbar_2007P A STIMULUS THAT REDUCES THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING BEHAVIOR SUCH THAT IT'S LESS LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE FUTURE
IanDunbar_2007P IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE NASTY SCARY OR PAINFUL AND I WOULD SAY IF IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THEN MAYBE IT SHOULDN 'T BE
IanDunbar_2007P I WAS WORKING WITH A VERY DANGEROUS DOG ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND THIS WAS A DOG THAT PUT BOTH HIS OWNERS IN HOSPITAL PLUS THE BROTHER IN LAW PLUS THE CHILD AND I ONLY AGREED TO WORK WITH IT IF THEY PROMISED IT WOULD STAY IN THEIR HOUSE AND THEY NEVER TOOK IT OUTSIDE
IanDunbar_2007P THE DOG IS ACTUALLY EUTHANIZED NOW BUT THIS WAS A DOG I WORKED WITH FOR A WHILE A LOT OF THE AGGRESSION HAPPENED AROUND THE KITCHEN SO WHILE I WAS THERE THIS WAS ON THE FOURTH VISIT WE DID A FOUR AND A HALF HOUR DOWN STAY WITH THE DOG ON HIS MAT
IanDunbar_2007P AND HE WAS KEPT THERE BY THE OWNER 'S CALM INSISTENCE WHEN THE DOG WOULD TRY TO LEAVE THE MAT SHE WOULD SAY
IanDunbar_2007P ON THE MAT ON THE MAT ON THE MAT
IanDunbar_2007P THE DOG BROKE HIS DOWN STAY TWENTY TWO TIMES IN FOUR AND A HALF HOURS WHILE SHE COOKED DINNER BECAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF AGGRESSION RELATED TOWARDS FOOD
IanDunbar_2007P THE BREAKS GOT FEWER AND FEWER YOU SEE THE PUNISHMENT WAS WORKING THE BEHAVIOR PROBLEM WAS GOING AWAY SHE NEVER RAISED HER VOICE IF SHE DID SHE WOULD HAVE GOT
IanDunbar_2007P NOT A GOOD DOG YOU SHOUT AT
IanDunbar_2007P A LOT OF MY FRIENDS TRAIN REALLY NEAT ANIMALS GRIZZLY BEARS IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN A GRIZZLY BEAR ON THE TELLY OR IN FILM THEN IT'S A FRIEND OF MINE WHO 'S TRAINED IT KILLER WHALES I LOVE IT BECAUSE IT WIRES YOU UP HOW ARE YOU GOING TO REPRIMAND A GRIZZLY BEAR
IanDunbar_2007P BAD BEAR BAD BEAR VOOM YOUR HEAD NOW IS ONE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY SAILING THROUGH THE AIR
IanDunbar_2007P THIS IS CRAZY SO
IanDunbar_2007P DO WE GO FROM HERE WE WANT A BETTER WAY DOGS DESERVE BETTER BUT FOR ME THE REASON FOR THIS ACTUALLY
IanDunbar_2007P DO WITH DOGS IT HAS TO DO WITH WATCHING PEOPLE TRAIN PUPPIES AND REALIZING THEY HAVE
IanDunbar_2007P INTERACTION SKILLS HORRENDOUS RELATIONSHIP SKILLS NOT JUST WITH THEIR PUPPY BUT WITH THE REST OF THE FAMILY AT CLASS
IanDunbar_2007P AND THERE'S THE OWNER IN THE PARK AND THEIR DOG 'S OVER HERE AND THEY SAY ROVER COME HERE ROVER COME HERE ROVER COME HERE YOU SON OF A BITCH THE DOG SAYS
IanDunbar_2007P THAT A DOG WOULD WANT TO APPROACH THEM WHEN THEY'RE SCREAMING LIKE THAT INSTEAD THE DOG SAYS I KNOW THAT TONE I KNOW THAT TONE PREVIOUSLY WHEN I'VE APPROACHED I'VE GOT PUNISHED THERE
IanDunbar_2007P I WAS WALKING ONTO A PLANE THIS FOR ME WAS A PIVOTAL MOMENT IN MY CAREER AND IT REALLY CEMENTED WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH THIS WHOLE PUPPY TRAINING THING
IanDunbar_2007P THE NOTION OF HOW TO TEACH PUPPIES IN A DOG FRIENDLY WAY TO WANT TO DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO SO WE DON'T HAVE TO FORCE THEM
IanDunbar_2007P I PUPPY TRAIN MY CHILD
IanDunbar_2007P FIVE KICKING THE BACK OF THE CHAIR JOHNNY DON'T DO THAT KICK KICK KICK JOHNNY DON'T DO THAT
IanDunbar_2007P I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE WITH MY BAG THE FATHER LEANS OVER GRABS HIM LIKE THIS AND GIVES HIM UGLY FACE AND UGLY FACE IS THIS WHEN YOU GO FACE TO FACE WITH A PUPPY OR A CHILD
IanDunbar_2007P I WENT OH MY GOD DO I DO SOMETHING THAT CHILD HAS LOST EVERYTHING THAT ONE OF THE TWO PEOPLE HE CAN TRUST IN THIS WORLD HAS ABSOLUTELY PULLED THE RUG FROM UNDER HIS FEET
IanDunbar_2007P KICKED A DOG I WOULD HAVE PUNCHED HIM OUT HE KICKED A CHILD GRABS THE CHILD LIKE THIS AND I LET IT GO AND THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
IanDunbar_2007P THE HUSBAND WON 'T CLEAR UP HIS CLOTHES OR THE WIFE 'S ALWAYS LATE FOR MEETINGS WHATEVER IT IS OK AND IT THEN STARTS
IanDunbar_2007P AND WE GET INTO THIS THING AND OUR PERSONAL FEEDBACK THERE'S TWO THINGS ABOUT IT WHEN YOU WATCH PEOPLE INTERACTING WITH ANIMALS OR OTHER PEOPLE THERE IS VERY LITTLE FEEDBACK IT'S TOO INFREQUENT AND WHEN IT HAPPENS IT'S BAD IT'S
IanDunbar_2007P IT'S AS IF THERE'S SOME SCHADENFREUDE THERE THAT WE ACTUALLY TAKE DELIGHT IN PEOPLE GETTING THINGS WRONG SO THAT WE CAN THEN MOAN AND GROAN AND BITCH AT THEM
IanDunbar_2007P AND THIS I WOULD SAY IS THE BIGGEST HUMAN FOIBLE THAT WE HAVE IT REALLY IS WE TAKE THE GOOD FOR GRANTED AND WE MOAN AND GROAN AT THE BAD
IanDunbar_2007P AND I THINK THIS WHOLE NOTION OF THESE SKILLS SHOULD BE TAUGHT YOU KNOW CALCULUS IS WONDERFUL WHEN I WAS A KID I WAS A CALCULUS WHIZ I DON'T UNDERSTAND A THING ABOUT IT NOW BUT I COULD DO IT AS A KID
IanDunbar_2007P GEOMETRY FANTASTIC YOU KNOW QUANTUM MECHANICS THESE ARE COOL THINGS BUT THEY DON'T SAVE MARRIAGES
IanDunbar_2007P AND THEY DON'T RAISE CHILDREN AND MY LOOK TO THE FUTURE IS AND WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH THIS DOGGY STUFF IS TO TEACH PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW YOUR HUSBAND 'S JUST AS EASY TO TRAIN
IanDunbar_2007P IF IT'S GOOD SAY THAT WAS REALLY NEAT THANK YOU THAT IS SUCH A POWERFUL TRAINING TECHNIQUE THIS SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS RELATIONSHIPS HOW DO YOU NEGOTIATE
IanDunbar_2007P YOU DO NEGOTIATE WITH YOUR FRIEND WHO WANTS YOUR TOY YOU KNOW HOW TO PREPARE YOU FOR YOUR FIRST RELATIONSHIP HOW ON EARTH ABOUT RAISING CHILDREN WE THINK HOW WE DO IT ONE NIGHT IN BED WE'RE PREGNANT AND THEN WE'RE RAISING
IanDunbar_2007P THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN LIFE A CHILD NO THIS IS WHAT SHOULD BE TAUGHT THE GOOD LIVING THE GOOD HABITS WHICH
IanDunbar_2007P JUST AS HARD TO BREAK AS BAD HABITS SO THAT WOULD BE MY WISH TO THE FUTURE AH DAMN I WANTED TO END EXACTLY ON TIME BUT I GOT EIGHT SEVEN SIX FIVE
IanDunbar_2007P FOUR THREE TWO SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT'S MY
