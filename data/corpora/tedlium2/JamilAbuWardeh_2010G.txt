JamilAbuWardeh_2010G IS ABOUT RIGHTING WRITING WRONGS NO THE SOUND 'S NOT FAULTY RIGHTING WRITING WRONGS
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G THE MIDDLE EAST IS HUGE
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO LAUGH AT OURSELVES BEFORE OTHERS CAN LAUGH WITH US THIS IS THE STORY OF THE RISE AND RISE OF STAND UP COMEDY IN THE MIDDLE EAST A STAND UP UPRISING IF YOU WILL
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G WORKING IN LONDON AS TV MAKER AND WRITER I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT COMEDY CONNECTS AUDIENCES
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G NOW THE BEST BREEDING GROUND FOR GOOD COMIC WRITING IS THE STAND UP COMEDY CIRCUIT WHERE THEY JUST HAPPEN TO SAY THAT YOU KILL WHEN YOU DO WELL AND YOU BOMB WHEN YOU DO BADLY
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G AN UNFORTUNATE CONNECTION FOR US MAYBE BUT IT REMINDS ME THAT
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G TO THANK ONE MAN FOR OVER THE PAST DECADE WORKING TIRELESSLY TO SUPPORT COMEDIANS ALL AROUND THE WORLD SPECIFICALLY
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G LIKE MY GOOD FRIENDS DEAN AND MAYSOON AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN WHO TWO YEARS AFTER NINE ELEVEN STARTED A FESTIVAL TO CHANGE THE WAY MIDDLE EASTERNERS ARE PERCEIVED IN THE WORLD
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G IT'S STILL GOING STRONG WITH POSITIVE PRESS TO DIE FOR ALSO THREE GUYS WORKING FOR YEARS IN LOS ANGELES AN IRANIAN A PALESTINIAN AND AN EGYPTIAN
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G COMEDY ACT AND WHEREVER THEY WENT
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G THEY KILLED
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G NOW I DIDN'T START THIS FIRE BUT I DID POUR PETROL ON IT I MOVED TO DUBAI AS THE HEAD OF ORIGINAL CONTENT FOR A WESTERN TV NETWORK MY JOB WAS TO CONNECT THE BRAND WITH A MIDDLE EASTERN AUDIENCE
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G THE AMERICAN HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G WANTED NEW LOCAL ARABIC COMEDY
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G IN A THICK ARABIC ACCENT MY BRAIN
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G NOW I HAD FRIENDS IN THE U S WHO HAD STARTED A SUCCESSFUL NEW TRIBE
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G AND I HAD EVERY INTENTION OF TAKING THEM FROM BEING OUTLIERS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND PUSHING THEM OVER THE TIPPING POINT TOWARDS SUCCESS
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G NOW AS WITH ANY NEW IDEA IT WASN'T EASY I HAD FOUR PHASES TO THIS PLAN FIRST WE'D NEED TO BUY CONTENT FROM THE WEST AND AIR IT THEN I'D BRING MY FRIENDS AND WE'D SHOW LOCAL AMATEURS HOW IT'S DONE WE WOULD FILM THAT AND AIR IT
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G SO I RETREATED BACK TO MY CAVE AND CONTINUED TO SUPPORT AND PRODUCE COMEDY AND LET MY FRIENDS USE MY COUCH AS A REGIONAL OPERATIONS HUB
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G NOW FAST FORWARD TWO YEARS TO EARLY TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G EARTH ROTATED AS DID OUR MANAGEMENT
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G AND AS IF BY DIVINE INTERVENTION THINGS CAME
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G AXIS GUYS RECORDED A COMEDY CENTRAL SPECIAL THAT AIRED IN THE STATES
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G AND IT WAS GETTING GREAT HITS ON
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G OUR NEW FRENCH CEO BELIEVED IN THE POWER OF POSITIVE PR
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G AND IDEAS DU BON MARCHE LET 'S JUST SAY VALUE FOR MONEY
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G I PRODUCED IN DUBAI A SHOW FOR AHMED AHMED TO SHOWCASE HIS NEW AXIS SPECIAL TO A PACKED ROOM I INVITED OUR NEW CEO AND AS SOON AS HE REALIZED WE HAD A ROOM PACKED FULL OF LAUGHING INFIDELS HIS REACTION WAS VERY SIMPLE LET 'S MAKE THIS
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G AND ONE MORE THING NO DON'T F IT UP SO I QUICKLY WENT TO WORK WITH A GREAT TEAM AROUND ME I HAPPENED TO FIND A FUNNY GUY TO PRESENT IT IN ARABIC WHO IS ORIGINALLY KOREAN
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G PERFECT FIT FOR THE AXIS OF EVIL THIS IS ALL TRUE NOW WHILE PREPARING FOR THE TOUR I HAD TO REMIND THE GUYS TO BE CULTURALLY SENSITIVE I USED THE THREE BS OF STAND UP
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G DON'TS AS I CALL THEM IN THE MIDDLE EAST BLUE CONTENT KEEP IT CLEAN BELIEFS NOT RELIGION AND THE THIRD B BOLITICS
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G STAY AWAY FROM BOLITICS IN THE MIDDLE EAST OH COURSE YOU MIGHT
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G THE AXIS SUCCESSFUL IN FIVE COUNTRIES IN JUST UNDER A MONTH WE HAD THOUSANDS OF FANATICAL FANS COME AND SEE THEM LIVE WE HAD MILLIONS SEE THEM ON TV AND ON TV NEWS

JamilAbuWardeh_2010G DUBAI TO ME IS LIKE
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G TWENTY YEARS AGO NO ONE HAD HEARD OF IT LOOK AT IT NOW
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G WITH AN INSPIRATIONAL LEADER I THINK THIS YEAR THE OPENING OF THE TALLEST TOWER IN THE WORLD IS LIKE ADDING A FINGER TO THAT HAND THAT POINTS AT ALL THOSE WHO SPREAD FALLACIOUS STORIES ABOUT US
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G NOW
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G IN THREE SHORT YEARS WE'VE COME A LONG WAY WITH STAND UP COMEDY SHOWS HAPPENING EVEN IN SAUDI ARABIA THESE COMICS ARE NOW GOING TO THE NEW YORK FESTIVAL

JamilAbuWardeh_2010G SO AS FOR THE OUTSIDERS LOOKING IN WATCH THE CNN REPORT ON THE SECOND ANMAN COMEDY FESTIVAL
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G THE REPORTER DID A GREAT JOB AND I THANK HER BUT SOMEBODY FORGOT TO SEND THE POSITIVE PR EMAIL TO THE PERSON OPERATING THE AUTOMATIC NEWS TICKER THAT APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G FOR EXAMPLE WHEN DEAN TALKS THE TICKER SAYS U S SUSPECT GAVE ACTIONABLE INTEL WELL IF YOU'RE USED TO LISTENING TO COMEDIANS
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G THEN I'M NOT SURPRISED
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G SADLY THIS LEADS ME TO ANOTHER THREE BS THAT REPRESENTS HOW THE MEDIA IN THE WEST TALKS ABOUT US AS BOMBERS BILLIONAIRES AND
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G ENOUGH
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G HERE ARE THREE QUESTIONS THAT I LIKE TO USE TO TEST THE TRUTHINESS OF OUR REPRESENTATION IN ANY MEDIA STORY ONE
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G IS THE MIDDLE EAST BEING SHOWN IN A CURRENT TIME AND CORRECT CONTEXT
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G DO THE MIDDLE EASTERN CHARACTERS LAUGH OR SMILE WITHOUT SHOWING THE WHITES OF THEIR EYES
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G IS THE MIDDLE
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G BEING PLAYED BY ONE
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G THERE ARE WRONGS THAT NEED TO BE RIGHTED WE'VE STARTED IN OUR REGION MY CHALLENGE TO THE REST OF THE WORLD
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G PLEASE START USING POSITIVE MIDDLE EASTERN IMAGES IN YOUR STORIES FOR INSPIRATION GO TO ONE OF OUR FESTIVALS GO ONLINE DROP US A LINE LET 'S CHANGE THE NARRATIVE TOGETHER
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G AND LET 'S START RIGHTING WRITING WRONGS I'D LIKE TO END BEFORE GOING BACK TO THE MIDDLE EAST WITH A QUOTE FROM ONE OF THE GREATEST SHEIKHS
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G TO PUT QUILL TO PARCHMENT AS MY FATHER LIKES TO CALL HIM ASHEIKH AZUBARE AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY SHAKESPEARE
