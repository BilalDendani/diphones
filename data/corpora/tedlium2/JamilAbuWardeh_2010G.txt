JamilAbuWardeh_2010G@357.49:368.67 WITH AN INSPIRATIONAL LEADER I THINK THIS YEAR THE OPENING OF THE TALLEST TOWER IN THE WORLD IS LIKE ADDING A FINGER TO THAT HAND THAT POINTS AT ALL THOSE WHO SPREAD FALLACIOUS STORIES ABOUT US
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G@373.23:373.74 NOW

JamilAbuWardeh_2010G@403.02:411.17 THE REPORTER DID A GREAT JOB AND I THANK HER BUT SOMEBODY FORGOT TO SEND THE POSITIVE PR EMAIL TO THE PERSON OPERATING THE AUTOMATIC NEWS TICKER THAT APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G@411.58:419.48 FOR EXAMPLE WHEN DEAN TALKS THE TICKER SAYS U S SUSPECT GAVE ACTIONABLE INTEL WELL IF YOU'RE USED TO LISTENING TO COMEDIANS

JamilAbuWardeh_2010G@422.87:430.43 SADLY THIS LEADS ME TO ANOTHER THREE BS THAT REPRESENTS HOW THE MEDIA IN THE WEST TALKS ABOUT US AS BOMBERS BILLIONAIRES AND
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G@432.95:433.60 ENOUGH
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G@451.48:459.26 HERE ARE THREE QUESTIONS THAT I LIKE TO USE TO TEST THE TRUTHINESS OF OUR REPRESENTATION IN ANY MEDIA STORY ONE
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G@460.07:465.28 IS THE MIDDLE EAST BEING SHOWN IN A CURRENT TIME AND CORRECT CONTEXT
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G@472.61:477.58 DO THE MIDDLE EASTERN CHARACTERS LAUGH OR SMILE WITHOUT SHOWING THE WHITES OF THEIR EYES
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G@481.83:482.54 IS THE MIDDLE
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G@483.77:485.28 BEING PLAYED BY ONE
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G@489.29:495.02 THERE ARE WRONGS THAT NEED TO BE RIGHTED WE'VE STARTED IN OUR REGION MY CHALLENGE TO THE REST OF THE WORLD

JamilAbuWardeh_2010G@506.39:513.98 AND LET 'S START RIGHTING WRITING WRONGS I'D LIKE TO END BEFORE GOING BACK TO THE MIDDLE EAST WITH A QUOTE FROM ONE OF THE GREATEST SHEIKHS
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G@514.54:520.86 TO PUT QUILL TO PARCHMENT AS MY FATHER LIKES TO CALL HIM ASHEIKH AZUBARE AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY SHAKESPEARE
