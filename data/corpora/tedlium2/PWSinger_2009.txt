PWSinger_2009@13.10:13.30 WHAT
PWSinger_2009@13.39:24.65 WE'RE GONNA DO IS ACTUALLY JUST FLASH A SERIES OF PHOTOS BEHIND ME THAT SHOW YOU THE REALITY OF ROBOTS USED IN WAR RIGHT NOW OR ALREADY AT THE PROTOTYPE STAGE IT'S JUST TO GIVE YOU A TASTE
PWSinger_2009@25.56:35.95 ANOTHER WAY OF PUTTING IT IS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE ANYTHING THAT'S POWERED BY VULCAN TECHNOLOGY OR TEENAGE WIZARD HORMONES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THIS IS ALL REAL SO WHY DON'T WE GO AHEAD AND START THOSE PICTURES
PWSinger_2009@36.85:49.31 SOMETHING BIG IS GOING ON IN WAR TODAY AND MAYBE EVEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY ITSELF THE U S MILITARY WENT INTO IRAQ WITH A HANDFUL OF DRONES IN THE AIR WE NOW HAVE FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED
PWSinger_2009@49.90:55.16 WE WENT IN WITH ZERO UNMANNED GROUND SYSTEMS WE NOW HAVE TWELVE THOUSAND
PWSinger_2009@55.79:67.45 AND THE TECH TERM KILLER APPLICATION TAKES ON NEW MEANING IN THIS SPACE WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MODEL T FOUR S THE WRIGHT FLIERS COMPARED TO WHAT'S COMING SOON
PWSinger_2009@68.36:82.71 THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT I RECENTLY MET WITH WAS AN AIR FORCE THREE STAR GENERAL AND HE SAID BASICALLY WHERE WE'RE HEADED VERY SOON IS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ROBOTS OPERATING IN OUR CONFLICTS AND THESE NUMBERS MATTER BECAUSE WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT
PWSinger_2009@83.52:91.48 TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TODAY 'S ROBOTS BUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THESE PROTOTYPES AND TOMORROWS ROBOTS BECAUSE OF COURSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS OPERATING
PWSinger_2009@91.62:101.02 IN TECHNOLOGY IS MOORE 'S LAW THAT YOU CAN PACK IN MORE AND MORE COMPUTING POWER INTO THOSE ROBOTS SO FLASH FORWARD AROUND TWENTY FIVE YEARS IF MOORE 'S HOLDS TRUE
PWSinger_2009@101.36:113.55 THOSE ROBOTS WILL BE CLOSE TO A BILLION TIMES MORE POWERFUL IN THEIR COMPUTING THAN TODAY AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE USED TO ONLY TALK ABOUT AT SCIENCE FICTION CONVENTIONS LIKE COMICON
PWSinger_2009@118.08:119.77 ROBOTS REVOLUTION IS UPON US
PWSinger_2009@120.73:135.09 NOW I NEED TO BE CLEAR HERE I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A REVOLUTION WHERE YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA SHOWING UP AT YOUR DOOR A LA THE TERMINATOR WHEN HISTORIANS LOOK AT THIS PERIOD THEY'RE GOING TO CONCLUDE THAT WE'RE AT A DIFFERENT TYPE OF REVOLUTION A REVOLUTION IN WAR
PWSinger_2009@136.20:138.15 LIKE THE INVENTION OF THE ATOMIC BOMB
PWSinger_2009@138.54:144.20 BUT IT MAY BE EVEN BIGGER THAN THAT BECAUSE OUR UNMANNED SYSTEMS DON'T JUST AFFECT THE HOW OF WAR FIGHTING
PWSinger_2009@144.95:158.99 THEY AFFECT THE WHO OF FIGHTING AT IT'S MOST FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL THAT IS EVERY PREVIOUS REVOLUTION IN WAR BE IT THE MACHINE GUN BE IN THE ATOMIC BOMB WAS ABOUT A SYSTEM THAT EITHER SHOT FASTER WENT FURTHER HAD A BIGGER BOOM
PWSinger_2009@168.22:176.56 ANOTHER WAY OF PUTTING THIS IS THAT MANKIND 'S FIVE THOUSAND YEAR OLD MONOPOLY ON THE FIGHTING OF WAR IS BREAKING DOWN IN OUR VERY LIFETIME
PWSinger_2009@177.27:184.67 I SPENT THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS GOING AROUND MEETING WITH ALL THE PLAYERS IN THIS FIELD FROM THE ROBOT SCIENTISTS TO THE SCIENCE FICTION AUTHORS WHO INSPIRED THEM
PWSinger_2009@184.85:194.17 TO THE NINETEEN YEAR OLD DRONE PILOTS WHO ARE FIGHTING FROM NEVADA TO THE FOUR STAR GENERALS WHO COMMAND THEM TO EVEN THE IRAQI INSURGENTS WHO THEY ARE TARGETING AND WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT OUR SYSTEMS
PWSinger_2009@194.95:208.34 WHAT I FOUND INTERESTING IS NOT JUST THEIR STORIES BUT HOW THEIR EXPERIENCES POINT TO THESE RIPPLE EFFECTS THAT ARE GOING OUTWARDS IN OUR SOCIETY AND OUR LAW AND OUR ETHICS ET CETERA AND SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO WITH MY REMAINING TIME IS BASICALLY FLESH OUT A COUPLE OF THESE
PWSinger_2009@209.14:213.15 SO THE FIRST IS THAT THE FUTURE OF WAR EVEN A ROBOTICS ONE
PWSinger_2009@213.76:215.56 NOT GOING TO BE PURELY AN AMERICAN ONE
PWSinger_2009@216.26:219.33 THE U S IS CURRENTLY AHEAD IN MILITARY ROBOTICS RIGHT NOW
PWSinger_2009@219.74:229.61 BUT WE KNOW THAT IN TECHNOLOGY THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A PERMANENT FIRST MOVER ADVANTAGE IN A QUICK SHOW OF HANDS HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM STILL USE WANG COMPUTERS
PWSinger_2009@230.73:235.22 IT'S THE SAME THING IN WAR THE BRITISH AND THE FRENCH INVENTED THE TANK
PWSinger_2009@235.96:238.01 THE GERMANS FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE IT RIGHT
PWSinger_2009@239.04:251.90 SO WHAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT FOR THE U S IS THAT WE ARE AHEAD RIGHT NOW BUT YOU HAVE FORTY THREE OTHER COUNTRIES OUT THERE WORKING ON MILITARY ROBOTICS AND THEY INCLUDE ALL THE INTERESTING COUNTRIES LIKE RUSSIA CHINA PAKISTAN IRAN
PWSinger_2009@252.78:254.76 THIS RAISES A BIGGER WORRY FOR ME
PWSinger_2009@255.95:263.68 HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS REVOLUTION GIVEN THE STATE OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND THE STATE OF OUR SCIENCE AND MATHMATICS TRAINING IN OUR SCHOOLS
PWSinger_2009@264.52:269.07 ANOTHER WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THIS IS WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO GO TO WAR INCREASINGLY WITH SOLDIERS
PWSinger_2009@269.52:271.88 WHOSE HARDWARE IS MADE IN CHINA
PWSinger_2009@272.27:274.26 AND SOFTWARE IS WRITTEN IN INDIA
PWSinger_2009@275.64:278.36 BUT JUST AS SOFTWARE HAS GONE OPEN SOURCE
PWSinger_2009@279.01:280.19 SO HAS WARFARE
PWSinger_2009@280.85:293.39 UNLIKE AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER OR AN ATOMIC BOMB YOU DON'T NEED A MASSIVE MANUFACTURING SYSTEM TO BUILD ROBOTICS A LOT OF IT IS OFF THE SHELF AND SOME IT IS EVEN DO IT YOURSELF ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU JUST SAW FLASH BEFORE YOU WAS A RAVEN DRONE A HAND HELD TOSSED ONE
PWSinger_2009@293.63:305.46 FOR ABOUT ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU CAN BUILD ONE YOURSELF EQUIVALENT TO WHAT THE SOLDIERS USE IN IRAQ THAT RAISES ANOTHER WRINKLE WHEN IT COMES TO WAR AND CONFLICT GOOD GUYS MIGHT PLAY AROUND AND WORK ON THESE AS HOBBY KITS
PWSinger_2009@306.10:314.16 SO MIGHT BAD GUYS THIS CROSS BETWEEN ROBOTICS AND THINGS LIKE TERRORISM IS GOING TO BE FASCINATING AND EVEN DISTURBING WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IT START
PWSinger_2009@315.20:324.12 DURING THE WAR BETWEEN ISRAEL A STATE AND HEZBOULAH A NON STATE ACTOR THE NON STATE ACTOR FLEW FOUR DIFFERENT DRONES AGAINST ISRAEL
PWSinger_2009@332.73:340.92 AND SO WHAT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE IS TWO TRENDS TAKE PLACE WITH THIS FIRST IS YOUR GOING TO REINFORCE THE POWER OF INDIVIDUALS AGAINST
PWSinger_2009@342.73:347.71 THE SECOND IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE AN EXPANSION IN THE REALM OF TERRORISM
PWSinger_2009@348.39:357.00 THE FUTURE OF IT MAY BE A CROSS BETWEEN AL QAEDA TWO POINT ZERO AND THE NEXT GENERATION OF THE UNABOMBER ANOTHER WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THIS IS THE FACT THAT
PWSinger_2009@357.80:364.99 YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONVINCE A ROBOT THAT THEY ARE GOING TO RECIEVE SEVENTY TWO VIRGINS AFTER THEY DIE TO CONVINCE THEM TO BLOW THEMSELVES UP
PWSinger_2009@366.52:378.33 THE RIPPLE EFFECTS OF THIS ARE GOING TO GO OUT INTO OUR POLITICS ONE OF THE PEOPLE I MET WAS A FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENCE FOR RONALD REGAN AND HE PUT IT THIS WAY QUOTE I LIKE THESE SYSTEMS BECAUSE THEY SAVE AMERICAN LIVES
PWSinger_2009@378.77:385.04 BUT I WORRY ABOUT MORE MARKETIZATION OF WARS MORE SHOCK AND AWE TALK TO DEFRAY DISCUSSION OF THE
PWSinger_2009@386.09:390.48 PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUPPORT THE USE OF FORCE IF THEY VIEW IT AS COSTLESS
PWSinger_2009@401.64:412.78 WE DON'T HAVE DECLARATIONS OF WAR ANYMORE WE DON'T BUY WAR BONDS ANYMORE AND NOW WE HAVE THE FACT THAT WE'RE CONVERTING MORE AND MORE OF OUR AMERICAN SOLDIERS THAT WE WOULD SEND INTO HARMS WAY
PWSinger_2009@413.25:418.30 INTO MACHINES AND SO WE MAY TAKE THOSE ALREADY LOWERING BARS TO WAR
PWSinger_2009@425.60:435.06 THAT IS OUR NEW TECHNOLOGIES DON'T MERELY REMOVE HUMANS FROM RISK THEY ALSO RECORD EVERYTHING THAT THEY SEE SO THEY DON'T JUST DELINK THE PUBLIC
PWSinger_2009@435.71:438.36 THEY RESHAPE IT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH WAR
PWSinger_2009@438.77:444.35 THERE'S ALREADY SEVERAL THOUSAND VIDEO CLIPS OF COMBAT FOOTAGE FROM IRAQ ON YOUTUBE RIGHT NOW
PWSinger_2009@444.93:446.62 MOST OF IT GATHERED BY DRONES
PWSinger_2009@447.24:453.85 NOW THIS COULD BE A GOOD THING IT COULD BE BUILDING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE HOME FRONT AND THE WAR FRONT AS NEVER BEFORE
PWSinger_2009@454.85:464.40 BUT REMEMBER THIS IS TAKING PLACE IN OUR STRANGE WEIRD WORLD AND SO INEVITABLY THE ABILITY TO DOWNLOAD THESE VIDEO CLIPS TO YOUR IPOD OR YOUR ZUNE
PWSinger_2009@467.20:469.86 THE ABILITY TO TURN IT INTO ENTERTAINMENT
PWSinger_2009@474.35:485.11 A TYPICAL ONE THAT I WAS SENT WAS AN EMAIL THAT HAD AN ATTACHMENT OF VIDEO OF A PREDATOR STRIKE TAKING OUT AN ENEMY SITE MISSILE HITS BODIES BURST INTO AIR AT THE EXPLOSION
PWSinger_2009@492.67:497.28 THIS ABILITY TO WATCH MORE BUT EXPERIENCE LESS
PWSinger_2009@506.68:513.52 WATCHING AN NBA GAME A PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL GAME ON TV WHERE THE ATHLETES ARE TINY FIGURES ON THE SCREEN
PWSinger_2009@532.17:535.12 WAR JUST BECOMES SLAM DUNKS AND SMART BOMBS
PWSinger_2009@536.49:541.33 NOW THE IRONY OF ALL THIS IS THAT WHILE THE FUTURE OF WAR MAY INVOLVE MORE AND MORE MACHINES
PWSinger_2009@542.02:552.02 IT'S OUR HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY THAT'S DRIVING ALL OF THIS IT'S OUR HUMAN FAILINGS THAT ARE LEADING TO THESE WARS SO ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS THAT HAS BIG RESONANCE IN THE POLICY REALM IS
PWSinger_2009@552.40:565.91 HOW THIS PLAYS OUT ON OUR VERY REAL WAR OF IDEAS THAT WE'RE FIGHTING AGAINST RADICAL GROUPS WHAT IS THE MESSAGE THAT WE THINK WE ARE SENDING WITH THESE MACHINES VERSUS WHAT IS BEING RECEIVED IN TERMS OF THE MESSAGE
PWSinger_2009@566.30:577.54 ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT I MET WAS SENIOR BUSH ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL WHO HAD THIS TO SAY ABOUT OUR UNMANNING OF WAR QUOTE IT PLAYS TO OUR STRENGTH THE THING THAT SCARES PEOPLE IS OUR TECHNOLOGY
PWSinger_2009@590.13:598.33 THIS IS JUST ANOTHER SIGN OF THE COLD HEARTED CRUEL ISRAELIS AND AMERICANS WHO ARE COWARDS BECAUSE THEY SEND OUT MACHINES TO FIGHT US
PWSinger_2009@598.57:605.34 THEY DON'T WANT TO FIGHT US LIKE REAL MEN BUT THEY'RE AFRAID TO FIGHT SO WE JUST HAVE TO KILL A FEW OF THEIR SOLDIERS TO DEFEAT THEM
PWSinger_2009@607.53:611.70 THE FUTURE OF WAR ALSO IS FEATURING A NEW TYPE OF WARRIOR
PWSinger_2009@623.27:631.96 WHILE NEVER LEAVING NEVADA QUOTE YOU 'RE GOING TO WAR FOR TWELVE HOURS SHOOTING WEAPONS AT TARGETS DIRECTING KILLS ON ENEMY COMBATANTS
PWSinger_2009@635.20:639.65 AND WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES YOU'RE SITTING AT THE DINNER TABLE TALKING TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT THEIR HOMEWORK
PWSinger_2009@640.66:651.42 NOW THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BALANCING OF THOSE EXPERIENCES IS INCREDIBLY TOUGH AND IN FACT THOSE DRONE PILOTS HAVE HIGHER RATES OF PTSD THAN MANY OF THE UNITS PHYSICALLY IN
PWSinger_2009@652.85:660.22 BUT SOME HAVE WORRIES THAT THIS DISCONNECTION WILL LEAD TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT IT MIGHT MAKE THE CONTEMPLATION OF WAR CRIMES A LOT EASIER WHEN YOU HAVE THIS DISTANCE
PWSinger_2009@661.62:667.06 LIKE A VIDEO GAME IS WHAT ONE YOUNG PILOT DESCRIBED TO ME OF TAKING OUT ENEMY TROOPS FROM AFAR
PWSinger_2009@676.30:685.60 SO MUCH OF WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM ME IS THAT THERE IS ANOTHER SIDE TO TECHNOLOGIC REVOLUTIONS AND THAT IT IS SHAPING OUR PRESENT AND MAYBE WILL SHAPE OUR FUTURE OF WAR
PWSinger_2009@686.47:688.14 MOORE 'S LAW IS OPERATIVE
PWSinger_2009@688.66:690.02 BUT SO IS MURPHY 'S LAW
PWSinger_2009@690.80:699.82 THE FOG OF WAR ISN'T BEING LIFTED THE ENEMY HAS A VOTE WE'RE GAINING INCREDIBLE NEW CAPABILITIES BUT WE'RE ALSO SEEING AND EXPERIENCING NEW HUMAN DILEMMAS
PWSinger_2009@707.17:715.73 WHAT ARE OOPS MOMENTS WITH ROBOTS AND WAR WELL SOMETIMES THEY'RE FUNNY SOMETIMES THEY'RE LIKE THAT SCENE FROM THE EDDIE MURPHY MOVIE BEST DEFENSE
PWSinger_2009@731.99:740.50 BUT OTHER TIMES OOPS MOMENTS ARE TRAGIC SUCH AS LAST YEAR IN SOUTH AFRICA WHERE AN ANTI AIRCRAFT CANNON HAD A QUOTE SOFTWARE GLITCH
PWSinger_2009@741.29:745.64 AND ACTUALLY DID TURN ON AND FIRED AND NINE SOLDIERS WERE KILLED
PWSinger_2009@746.67:759.17 WE HAVE NEW WRINKLES IN THE LAWS OF WAR AND ACCOUNTABILITY WHAT DO WE DO WITH THINGS LIKE UNMANNED SLAUGHTER WHAT IS UNMANNED SLAUGHTER WE'VE ALREADY HAD THREE INSTANCES OF PREDATOR DRONE STRIKES WHERE WE THOUGHT WE GOT
PWSinger_2009@760.36:762.07 AND IT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE THE CASE
PWSinger_2009@762.72:769.76 THIS IS WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW THIS IS NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT ARMED AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS WITH FULL AUTHORITY TO USE FORCE
PWSinger_2009@770.22:771.81 AND DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT
PWSinger_2009@773.01:777.09 DURING MY RESEARCH I CAME ACROSS FOUR DIFFERENT PENTAGON PROJECTS ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF
PWSinger_2009@778.24:779.63 AND SO YOU HAVE THIS QUESTION
PWSinger_2009@787.37:790.24 THEY DON'T COMMIT CRIMES OF RAGE AND REVENGE
PWSinger_2009@791.14:793.50 BUT ROBOTS ARE EMOTIONLESS
PWSinger_2009@794.55:800.65 THEY SEE AN EIGHTY YEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER IN A WHEELCHAIR THE SAME WAY THEY SEE A T EIGHTY TANK
PWSinger_2009@801.17:804.28 THEY'RE BOTH JUST A SERIES OF ZEROS AND ONES
PWSinger_2009@804.95:814.30 AND SO WE HAVE THIS QUESTION TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE CATCH UP OUR TWENTIETH CENTURY LAWS OF WAR THAT ARE SO OLD RIGHT NOW THAT THEY COULD QUALIFY FOR MEDICARE
PWSinger_2009@819.02:829.49 IN CONCLUSION I'VE TALKED ABOUT WHAT SEEMS THE FUTURE OF WAR BUT NOTICE THAT I'VE ONLY USED REAL WORLD EXAMPLES AND YOU'VE ONLY SEEN REAL WORLD PICTURES AND VIDEOS
PWSinger_2009@830.18:841.81 THIS SETS A GREAT CHALLENGE FOR ALL OF US THAT WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WELL BEFORE YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR ROOMBA SUCKING THE LIFE AWAY FROM YOU ARE WE GOING TO LET THE FACT THAT WHAT IS UNVEILING ITSELF RIGHT NOW IN WAR
PWSinger_2009@842.79:846.29 SOUNDS LIKE SCIENCE FICTION AND THEREFORE KEEPS US IN DENIAL
PWSinger_2009@847.23:850.34 ARE WE GOING TO FACE THE REALITY OF TWENTY ONE ST CENTURY WAR
PWSinger_2009@850.80:855.90 IS OUR GENERATION GOING TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE THAT A PAST GENERATION DID WITH ATOMIC WEAPONRY
PWSinger_2009@856.47:860.62 AND NOT DEAL WITH THE ISSUES THAT SURROUND IT UNTIL PANDORA 'S BOX WAS ALREADY OPENED UP
PWSinger_2009@862.09:869.67 NOW I COULD BE WRONG ON THIS AND ONE PENTAGON ROBOT SCIENTIST TOLD ME THAT I WAS HE SAID THERE 'S NO REAL SOCIAL ETHICAL MORAL ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TO ROBOTS
PWSinger_2009@870.87:875.31 THAT IS HE ADDED UNLESS THE MACHINE KILLS THE WRONG PEOPLE REPEATEDLY
PWSinger_2009@877.25:880.42 QUOTE THEN IT'S JUST A PRODUCT RECALL ISSUE
PWSinger_2009@882.01:887.19 AND SO THE ENDING POINT FOR THIS IS THAT ACTUALLY WE CAN TURN TO HOLLYWOOD
PWSinger_2009@888.13:896.67 A FEW YEARS AGO HOLLYWOOD GATHERED ALL THE TOP CHARACTERS AND CREATED A LIST OF THE TOP ONE HUNDRED HEROS AND TOP ONE HUNDRED VILLAINS OF ALL OF HOLLYWOOD HISTORY
PWSinger_2009@897.32:899.08 THE CHARACTERS THAT REPRESENTED THE BEST
PWSinger_2009@899.62:900.94 AND WORST OF HUMANITY
PWSinger_2009@901.74:904.54 ONLY ONE CHARACTER MADE IT ON TO BOTH LISTS
PWSinger_2009@906.09:908.69 THE TERMINATOR A ROBOT KILLING MACHINE
PWSinger_2009@909.31:917.49 THAT POINTS TO THE FACT THAT OUR MACHINES CAN BE USED FOR BOTH GOOD AND EVIL BUT FOR ME IT POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS A DUALITY OF HUMANS AS WELL
PWSinger_2009@919.14:928.77 THIS WEEK IS A CELEBRATION OF OUR CREATIVITY OUR CREATIVITY HAS TAKEN OUR SPECIES TO THE STARS OUR CREATIVITY HAS CREATED WORKS OF ARTS AND LITERATURE TO EXPRESS
PWSinger_2009@930.36:940.79 AND NOW WE'RE USING OUR CREATIVITY IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION TO BUILD FANTASTIC MACHINES WITH INCREDIBLE CAPABILITIES MAYBE EVEN ONE DAY AN ENTIRELY NEW SPECIES
PWSinger_2009@942.45:944.73 BUT ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT WE'RE DOING THAT
PWSinger_2009@945.32:947.53 IS BECAUSE OF OUR DRIVE TO DESTROY EACH OTHER
PWSinger_2009@952.08:954.92 OR IS IT US THAT'S WIRED FOR WAR THANK YOU
