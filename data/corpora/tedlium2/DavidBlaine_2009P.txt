DavidBlaine_2009P@16.07:27.30 AS A MAGICIAN I TRY TO CREATE IMAGES THAT MAKE PEOPLE STOP AND THINK I ALSO TRY TO CHALLENGE MYSELF TO DO THINGS THAT DOCTORS SAY ARE NOT POSSIBLE
DavidBlaine_2009P@37.91:40.69 I LIVED THERE WITH NOTHING BUT WATER
DavidBlaine_2009P@51.08:58.02 BLOCK OF ICE FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN NEW YORK CITY THAT ONE WAS WAY MORE DIFFICULT THAN I HAD EXPECTED
DavidBlaine_2009P@59.26:70.65 THE ONE AFTER THAT I STOOD ON TOP OF A HUNDRED FOOT PILLAR FOR THIRTY SIX HOURS I BEGAN TO HALLUCINATE SO HARD THAT THE BUILDINGS THAT WERE BEHIND ME STARTED TO LOOK LIKE BIG ANIMAL HEADS
DavidBlaine_2009P@71.51:83.47 SO NEXT I WENT TO LONDON IN LONDON I LIVED IN A GLASS BOX FOR FORTY FOUR DAYS WITH NOTHING BUT WATER IT WAS FOR ME ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS I'D EVER DONE BUT IT WAS ALSO
DavidBlaine_2009P@90.89:94.55 THEY STARTED FLYING CHEESEBURGERS ON HELICOPTERS AROUND MY BOX
DavidBlaine_2009P@96.56:104.47 SO I FELT VERY VALIDATED WHEN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE ACTUALLY USED THE RESEARCH FOR SCIENCE
DavidBlaine_2009P@105.78:117.80 MY NEXT PURSUIT WAS I WANTED TO SEE HOW LONG I COULD GO WITHOUT BREATHING LIKE HOW LONG I COULD SURVIVE WITH NOTHING NOT EVEN AIR I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT IT WOULD BECOME THE MOST AMAZING JOURNEY OF MY LIFE
DavidBlaine_2009P@120.31:121.59 AS A YOUNG MAGICIAN
DavidBlaine_2009P@122.24:136.09 I WAS OBSESSED WITH HOUDINI AND HIS UNDERWATER CHALLENGES SO I BEGAN EARLY ON COMPETING AGAINST THE OTHER KIDS SEEING HOW LONG I COULD STAY UNDERWATER WHILE THEY WENT UP AND DOWN TO BREATHE YOU KNOW FIVE TIMES WHILE I STAYED UNDER ON ONE BREATH
DavidBlaine_2009P@136.79:145.28 BY THE TIME I WAS A TEENAGER I WAS ABLE TO HOLD MY BREATH FOR THREE MINUTES AND THIRTY SECONDS I WOULD LATER FIND OUT THAT WAS HOUDINI 'S PERSONAL RECORD
DavidBlaine_2009P@157.59:170.63 WAS UNDERNEATH NOT BREATHING FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES WHEN THE RESCUE WORKERS CAME THEY RESUSCITATED HIM AND THERE WAS NO BRAIN DAMAGE HIS CORE TEMPERATURE HAD DROPPED TO SEVENTY SEVEN DEGREES
DavidBlaine_2009P@171.55:186.00 AS A MAGICIAN I THINK EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE AND I THINK IF SOMETHING IS DONE BY ONE PERSON IT CAN BE DONE BY OTHERS I STARTED TO THINK IF THE BOY COULD SURVIVE WITHOUT BREATHING FOR THAT LONG THERE MUST BE A WAY THAT I COULD DO IT
DavidBlaine_2009P@186.92:194.55 SO I MET WITH A TOP NEUROSURGEON AND I ASKED HIM HOW LONG IS IT POSSIBLE TO GO WITHOUT BREATHING LIKE HOW LONG COULD I GO WITHOUT AIR
DavidBlaine_2009P@194.96:205.71 AND HE SAID TO ME THAT ANYTHING OVER SIX MINUTES YOU HAVE A SERIOUS RISK OF HYPOXIC BRAIN DAMAGE SO I TOOK THAT AS A CHALLENGE BASICALLY
DavidBlaine_2009P@207.15:208.53 MY FIRST TRY
DavidBlaine_2009P@209.69:212.66 I FIGURED THAT I COULD DO SOMETHING SIMILAR
DavidBlaine_2009P@214.01:217.70 AND I CREATED A WATER TANK AND I FILLED IT WITH ICE
DavidBlaine_2009P@218.32:232.55 AND FREEZING COLD WATER AND I STAYED INSIDE OF THAT WATER TANK HOPING MY CORE TEMPERATURE WOULD START TO DROP AND I WAS SHIVERING IN MY FIRST ATTEMPT TO HOLD MY BREATH I COULDN'T EVEN LAST A MINUTE SO I REALIZED THAT WAS COMPLETELY NOT GOING TO WORK
DavidBlaine_2009P@233.97:236.09 SO I WENT TO TALK TO A DOCTOR FRIEND
DavidBlaine_2009P@239.04:248.78 AND I ASKED HIM HOW COULD I DO THAT I WANT TO HOLD MY BREATH FOR A REALLY LONG TIME HOW COULD IT BE DONE AND HE SAID DAVID YOU'RE A MAGICIAN
DavidBlaine_2009P@252.04:252.79 EASIER
DavidBlaine_2009P@256.20:260.29 SO HE CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA OF CREATING A REBREATHER
DavidBlaine_2009P@260.77:264.36 WITH A CO TWO SCRUBBER WHICH WAS BASICALLY
DavidBlaine_2009P@266.18:275.07 TUBE FROM HOME DEPOT WITH A BALLOON DUCT TAPED TO IT THAT HE THOUGHT WE COULD PUT INSIDE OF ME AND SOMEHOW BE ABLE TO
DavidBlaine_2009P@281.69:284.58 A LITTLE HARD TO WATCH BUT THIS IS THAT
DavidBlaine_2009P@292.08:293.20 SO THAT CLEARLY WASN'T
DavidBlaine_2009P@298.30:309.48 THEN I ACTUALLY STARTED THINKING ABOUT LIQUID BREATHING THERE IS A CHEMICAL THAT'S CALLED PERFLUBRON AND IT'S SO HIGH IN OXYGEN LEVELS THAT IN THEORY YOU COULD BREATHE IT
DavidBlaine_2009P@329.05:339.05 WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO HOOK UP A HEART LUNG BYPASS MACHINE AND HAVE A SURGERY WHERE IT WAS A TUBE GOING INTO MY ARTERY AND THEN APPEAR TO NOT BREATHE WHILE THEY WERE OXYGENATING
DavidBlaine_2009P@340.69:348.52 WHICH WAS ANOTHER INSANE IDEA OBVIOUSLY THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT THE CRAZIEST IDEA OF ALL THE IDEAS
DavidBlaine_2009P@349.85:351.05 TO ACTUALLY DO IT
DavidBlaine_2009P@352.55:358.23 TO ACTUALLY TRY TO HOLD MY BREATH PAST THE POINT THAT DOCTORS WOULD CONSIDER YOU
DavidBlaine_2009P@361.17:373.68 SO I STARTED RESEARCHING INTO PEARL DIVERS YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY GO DOWN FOR FOUR MINUTES ON ONE BREATH AND WHEN I WAS RESEARCHING PEARL DIVERS I FOUND THE WORLD OF FREEDIVING IT WAS THE MOST
DavidBlaine_2009P@374.52:389.86 AMAZING THING THAT I EVER DISCOVERED PRETTY MUCH THERE IS MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS TO FREEDIVING THERE IS DEPTH RECORDS WHERE PEOPLE GO AS DEEP AS THEY CAN AND THEN THERE IS STATIC APNEA THAT'S HOLDING YOUR BREATH AS LONG AS YOU CAN IN ONE PLACE WITHOUT MOVING
DavidBlaine_2009P@390.45:399.06 THAT WAS THE ONE THAT I STUDIED THE FIRST THING THAT I LEARNED IS WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR BREATH YOU SHOULD NEVER MOVE AT ALL THAT WASTES ENERGY AND THAT
DavidBlaine_2009P@411.98:418.39 JUST CONTROL THAT AND THEN I LEARNED HOW TO PURGE PURGING IS BASICALLY HYPERVENTILATING YOU BLOW IN
DavidBlaine_2009P@423.48:432.11 DO THAT YOU GET LIGHTHEADED YOU GET TINGLING AND YOU'RE REALLY RIDDING YOUR BODY OF CO TWO SO WHEN YOU HOLD YOUR BREATH IT'S INFINITELY EASIER
DavidBlaine_2009P@432.68:434.82 THEN I LEARNED THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE A HUGE BREATH
DavidBlaine_2009P@436.75:450.54 JUST HOLD AND RELAX AND NEVER LET ANY AIR OUT AND JUST HOLD AND RELAX THROUGH ALL THE PAIN EVERY MORNING THIS IS FOR MONTHS I WOULD WAKE UP AND THE FIRST THING THAT I WOULD DO IS I WOULD HOLD MY BREATH
DavidBlaine_2009P@451.35:460.12 FOR OUT OF FIFTY TWO MINUTES I WOULD HOLD MY BREATH FOR FORTY FOUR MINUTES SO BASICALLY WHAT THAT MEANS IS I WOULD PURGE I'D BREATH REALLY HARD FOR A MINUTE
DavidBlaine_2009P@460.42:465.70 AND I WOULD HOLD IMMEDIATELY AFTER FOR FIVE AND HALF MINUTES THEN I WOULD BREATH AGAIN FOR A MINUTE
DavidBlaine_2009P@466.05:473.65 PURGING AS HARD AS I CAN THEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT I WOULD HOLD AGAIN FOR FIVE AND HALF MINUTES I WOULD REPEAT THIS PROCESS EIGHT TIMES IN A ROW
DavidBlaine_2009P@474.35:487.90 FIFTY TWO MINUTES YOU'RE ONLY BREATHING FOR EIGHT MINUTES AT THE END OF THAT YOU'RE COMPLETELY FRIED YOUR BRAIN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE WALKING AROUND IN A DAZE AND YOU HAVE THESE AWFUL HEADACHES BASICALLY I'M NOT HE BEST PERSON TO TALK TO WHEN I'M DOING THAT STUFF
DavidBlaine_2009P@488.22:495.96 I STARTED LEARNING ABOUT THE WORLD RECORD HOLDER HIS NAME IS TOM SIETAS AND THIS GUY IS PERFECTLY BUILT FOR HOLDING HIS BREATH
DavidBlaine_2009P@496.21:504.93 HE 'S SIX FOOT FOUR HE 'S ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY POUNDS AND HIS TOTAL LUNG CAPACITY IS IS TWICE THE SIZE OF AN AVERAGE PERSON
DavidBlaine_2009P@505.61:508.02 I'M SIX FOOT ONE AND FAT
DavidBlaine_2009P@509.33:509.96 SAY BIG
DavidBlaine_2009P@512.46:524.74 I HAD TO DROP FIFTY POUNDS IN THREE MONTHS SO EVERYTHING THAT I PUT INTO MY BODY I CONSIDERED AS MEDICINE EVERY BIT OF FOOD WAS EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS FOR ITS NUTRITIONAL VALUE
DavidBlaine_2009P@525.13:532.99 I ATE REALLY SMALL CONTROLLED PORTIONS THOUGHOUT THE DAY AND I STARTED TO REALLY ADAPT MY BODY
DavidBlaine_2009P@538.69:550.95 THINNER I WAS THE LONGER I WAS ABLE TO HOLD MY BREATH AND BY EATING SO WELL AND TRAINING SO HARD MY RESTING HEART RATE DROPPED TO THIRTY EIGHT BEATS PER MINUTE WHICH IS LOWER THAN MOST OLYMPIC ATHLETES
DavidBlaine_2009P@552.36:556.84 IN FOUR MONTHS OF TRAINING I WAS ABLE TO HOLD MY BREATH FOR OVER SEVEN MINUTES
DavidBlaine_2009P@557.60:565.99 I WANTED TO TRY HOLDING MY BREATH EVERYWHERE I WANTED TO TRY IT IN THE MOST EXTREME SITUATIONS TO SEE IF I COULD SLOW MY HEART RATE DOWN UNDER
DavidBlaine_2009P@570.73:582.17 I DECIDED THAT I WAS GOING TO BREAK THE WORLD RECORD LIVE ON PRIME TIME TELEVISION THE WORLD RECORD WAS EIGHT MINUTES AND FIFTY EIGHT SECONDS HELD BY TOM SIETAS THAT GUY WITH THE WHALE LUNGS I TOLD
DavidBlaine_2009P@584.29:588.52 I ASSUMED THAT I COULD PUT A WATER TANK AT LINCOLN CENTER AND
DavidBlaine_2009P@589.04:599.29 IF I STAYED THERE A WEEK NOT EATING I WOULD GET COMFORTABLE IN THAT SITUATION AND I WOULD SLOW MY METABOLISM WHICH I WAS SURE WOULD HELP ME HOLD MY BREATH LONGER THAN I HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO IT
DavidBlaine_2009P@599.99:601.39 I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG
DavidBlaine_2009P@602.76:613.61 I ENTERED THE SPHERE A WEEK BEFORE THE SCHEDULED AIR DATE AND I THOUGHT EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE ON TRACK TWO DAYS BEFORE MY BIG BREATH HOLD ATTEMPT FOR THE RECORD
DavidBlaine_2009P@614.09:617.02 THE PRODUCERS OF MY TELEVISION SPECIAL THOUGHT THAT
DavidBlaine_2009P@617.94:623.94 JUST WATCHING SOMEBODY HOLDING THEIR BREATH AND ALMOST DROWNING IS TOO BORING FOR TELEVISION
DavidBlaine_2009P@626.82:629.97 SO I HAD TO ADD HANDCUFFS WHILE HOLDING MY BREATH
DavidBlaine_2009P@630.12:642.75 TO ESCAPE FROM THIS WAS A CRITICAL MISTAKE BECAUSE OF THE MOVEMENT I WAS WASTING OXYGEN AND BY SEVEN MINUTES I HAD GONE INTO THESE AWFUL CONVULSIONS
DavidBlaine_2009P@644.32:648.18 BY SEVEN EIGHT I STARTED TO BLACK OUT
DavidBlaine_2009P@649.42:655.37 AND BY SEVEN MINUTES AND THIRTY SECONDS THEY HAD TO PULL MY BODY OUT AND BRING ME BACK
DavidBlaine_2009P@660.36:662.19 I HAD FAILED ON EVERY LEVEL
DavidBlaine_2009P@664.85:669.08 SO NATURALLY THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THE SLUMP THAT I COULD THINK OF
DavidBlaine_2009P@670.00:672.70 WAS I DECIDED TO CALL OPRAH
DavidBlaine_2009P@676.45:690.08 I TOLD HER THAT I WANTED TO UP THE ANTE AND HOLD MY BREATH LONGER THAN ANY HUMAN BEING EVER HAD THIS WAS A DIFFERENT RECORD THIS WAS A PURE O TWO STATIC APNEA RECORD THAT GUINNESS HAD SET THE WORLD RECORD AT THIRTEEN MINUTES
DavidBlaine_2009P@691.75:699.36 SO BASICALLY YOU BREATH PURE O TWO FIRST OXYGENATING YOUR BODY FLUSHING OUT CO TWO AND YOU ARE ABLE TO HOLD MUCH LONGER
DavidBlaine_2009P@700.84:704.82 I REALIZED THAT MY REAL COMPETITION WAS THE BEAVER
DavidBlaine_2009P@712.57:720.67 IN JANUARY OF EIGHT OPRAH GAVE ME FOUR MONTHS TO PREPARE AND TRAIN SO I WOULD SLEEP IN A HYPOXIC TENT EVERY NIGHT
DavidBlaine_2009P@720.93:732.50 A HYPOXIC TENT IS A TENT THAT SIMULATES ALTITUDE AT FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEET SO IT'S LIKE BASECAMP EVEREST WHAT THAT DOES IS YOU START BUILDING UP THE RED BLOODCELL COUNT
DavidBlaine_2009P@740.77:750.21 BRAIN IS COMPLETELY WIPED OUT MY FIRST ATTEMPT ON PURE O TWO I WAS ABLE TO GO UP TO FIFTEEN MINUTES SO IT WAS A PRETTY BIG SUCCESS
DavidBlaine_2009P@750.48:760.01 THE NEUROSURGEON PULLED ME OUT OF THE WATER BECAUSE IN HIS MIND AT FIFTEEN MINUTES YOUR BRAIN IS DONE YOU'RE BRAINDEAD SO HE PULLED ME UP AND I WAS FINE
DavidBlaine_2009P@760.98:773.46 THERE WAS ONE PERSON THERE THAT WAS DEFINITELY NOT IMPRESSED IT WAS MY EX GIRLFRIEND WHILE I WAS BREAKING THE RECORD UNDERWATER FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE WAS SIFTING THROUGH MY BLACKBERRY CHECKING ALL MY MESSAGES
DavidBlaine_2009P@776.07:778.05 MY BROTHER HAD A PICTURE OF IT IT IS
DavidBlaine_2009P@783.78:792.93 I THEN ANNOUNCED THAT I WAS GOING TO GO FOR SIETAS RECORD PUBLICLY AND WHAT HE DID IN RESPONSE IS HE WENT ON REGIS AND KELLY
DavidBlaine_2009P@793.49:797.35 AND BROKE HIS OLD RECORD THEN HIS MAIN COMPETITOR
DavidBlaine_2009P@798.59:808.72 AND BROKE HIS RECORD SO HE SUDDENLY PUSHED THE RECORD UP TO SIXTEEN MINUTES AND THIRTY TWO SECONDS WHICH WAS THREE MINUTES LONGER THAN I HAD PREPARED YOU KNOW IT WAS LONGER THAN THE RECORD
DavidBlaine_2009P@810.53:823.59 NOW I WANTED TO GET THE SCIENCE TIMES TO DOCUMENT THIS I WANTED TO GET THEM TO DO A PIECE ON IT SO I DID WHAT ANY PERSON SERIOUSLY PURSUING SCIENTIFIC ADVANCEMENT WOULD DO
DavidBlaine_2009P@824.14:827.89 I WALKED INTO THE NEW YORK TIMES OFFICES AND DID CARD TRICKS TO EVERYBODY
DavidBlaine_2009P@832.18:843.38 SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS THE MAGIC OR THE LORE OF THE CAYMAN ISLANDS BUT JOHN TIERNEY FLEW DOWN AND DID A PIECE ON THE SERIOUSNESS OF BREATH HOLDING WHILE HE WAS THERE I TRIED TO IMPRESS HIM OF COURSE AND I DID A
DavidBlaine_2009P@843.79:849.49 DIVE DOWN TO ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FEET WHICH IS BASICALLY THE HEIGHT OF A SIXTEEN STORY BUILDING
DavidBlaine_2009P@849.95:858.67 AND AS I WAS COMING UP I BLACKED OUT UNDERWATER WHICH IS REALLY DANGEROUS THAT'S HOW YOU DROWN LUCKILY KIRK HAD SEEN ME AND HE SWAM OVER AND PULLED ME UP
DavidBlaine_2009P@859.21:870.90 SO I STARTED FULL FOCUS I COMPLETELY TRAINED TO GET MY BREATH HOLD TIME UP FOR WHAT I NEEDED TO DO BUT THERE WAS NO WAY TO PREPARE FOR THE LIVE TELEVISION ASPECT OF IT BEING ON OPRAH
DavidBlaine_2009P@871.72:881.76 BUT IN PRACTICE I WOULD DO IT FACE DOWN FLOATING ON THE POOL BUT FOR TV THEY WANTED ME TO BE UPRIGHT SO THEY COULD SEE MY FACE BASICALLY
DavidBlaine_2009P@882.48:895.41 THE OTHER PROBLEM WAS THE SUIT WAS SO BOUYANT THAT THEY HAD TO STRAP MY FEET IN TO KEEP ME FROM FLOATING UP SO I HAD TO USE MY LEGS TO HOLD MY FEET INTO THE STRAPS THAT WERE LOOSE WHICH WAS A REAL PROBLEM FOR ME
DavidBlaine_2009P@896.66:905.54 THAT MADE ME EXTREMELY NERVOUS RAISING THE HEART RATE THEN WHAT THEY ALSO DID WAS WHICH WE NEVER DID BEFORE IS THERE WAS A HEART RATE MONITOR
DavidBlaine_2009P@905.79:918.87 AND IT WAS RIGHT NEXT TO THE SPHERE SO EVERY TIME MY HEART WOULD BEAT I'D HEAR THE BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP YOU KNOW THE TICKING REALLY LOUD WHICH WAS MAKING ME MORE NERVOUS AND THERE IS NO WAY TO SLOW MY HEART RATE DOWN SO
DavidBlaine_2009P@920.89:929.13 NORMALLY I WOULD START AT THIRTY EIGHT BEATS PER MINUTE AND WHILE HOLDING MY BREATH IT WOULD DROP TO TWELVE BEATS PER MINUTE WHICH IS PRETTY UNUSUAL
DavidBlaine_2009P@935.91:938.73 THIS TIME IT STARTED AT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY BEATS
DavidBlaine_2009P@939.21:940.66 AND IT NEVER WENT DOWN
DavidBlaine_2009P@951.66:957.43 AND I WAS GETTING MORE NERVOUS AND THE HEART RATE JUST KEPT GOING UP AND UP ALL THE WAY UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BEATS
DavidBlaine_2009P@960.91:964.02 BASICALLY IT'S THE SAME THING THAT CREATED MY DOWNFALL AT LINCOLN CENTER
DavidBlaine_2009P@966.09:976.11 WHEN I MADE IT TO THE HALFWAY MARK AT EIGHT MINUTES I WAS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CERTAIN THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS THERE WAS NO WAY FOR ME TO DO IT SO
DavidBlaine_2009P@976.54:985.60 I FIGURED OPRAH HAD DEDICATED AN HOUR TO DOING THIS BREATH HOLD THING IF I HAD CRACKED EARLY IT WOULD BE A WHOLE SHOW ABOUT HOW DEPRESSED I AM SO
DavidBlaine_2009P@987.45:993.90 I FIGURED I'M BETTER OFF JUST FIGHTING AND STAYING THERE UNTIL I BLACK OUT AT LEAST THEN THEY CAN PULL ME OUT AND TAKE CARE OF ME AND ALL
DavidBlaine_2009P@998.10:1005.34 I KEPT PUSHING TO TEN MINUTES AT TEN MINUTES YOU START GETTING ALL THESE REALLY STRONG TINGLING SENSATIONS IN YOUR FINGERS AND TOES
DavidBlaine_2009P@1005.70:1012.53 AND I KNEW THAT THAT WAS BLOOD SHUNTING WHEN THE BLOOD RUSHES AWAY FROM YOUR EXTREMITIES TO PROVIDE OXYGEN TO YOUR VITAL ORGANS
DavidBlaine_2009P@1021.39:1029.57 TO FEEL REALLY STRANGE AT MINUTE TWELVE I STARTED TO HAVE RINGING IN MY EARS AND I STARTED TO FEEL MY ARM GOING
DavidBlaine_2009P@1030.31:1036.59 AND I'M A HYPOCHONDRIAC AND I REMEMBER ARM NUMB MEANS HEART ATTACK SO I STARTED TO REALLY GET REALLY PARANOID
DavidBlaine_2009P@1037.45:1045.66 THEN AT THIRTEEN MINUTES MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE HYPOCHONDRIA I STARTED FEELING PAINS ALL OVER MY CHEST IT WAS AWFUL
DavidBlaine_2009P@1047.24:1052.11 FOURTEEN MINUTES I HAD THESE AWFUL CONTRACTIONS LIKE THIS URGE TO BREATHE
DavidBlaine_2009P@1095.76:1107.79 SO I LET MY FEET OUT AND I STARTED FLOATING TO THE TOP AND I DIDN'T TAKE MY HEAD OUT BUT I WAS JUST FLOATING THERE WAITING FOR MY HEART TO STOP JUST WAITING THEY HAD DOCTORS WITH THE PST YOU KNOW SO SITTING THERE WAITING
DavidBlaine_2009P@1108.58:1114.80 AND THEN SUDDENLY I HEAR SCREAMING AND I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME WEIRD THING THAT I HAD DIED OR SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED
DavidBlaine_2009P@1115.51:1126.89 AND THEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD MADE IT TO SIXTEEN THIRTY TWO SO WITH THE ENERGY OF EVERYBODY THAT WAS THERE I DECIDED TO KEEP PUSHING AND I WENT TO SEVENTEEN MINUTES AND FOUR SECONDS
DavidBlaine_2009P@1136.29:1153.18 THAT WASN'T ENOUGH WHAT I DID IMMEDIATELY AFTER IS I WENT TO QUEST LABS AND HAD THEM TAKE EVERY BLOOD SAMPLE THAT THEY COULD TO TEST FOR EVERYTHING AND TO SEE WHERE MY LEVELS WERE SO THE DOCTORS COULD USE IT ONCE AGAIN I ALSO DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO QUESTION IT I HAD THE WORLD RECORD AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS LEGITIMATE
DavidBlaine_2009P@1162.44:1168.10 LIKE YEAH HE SAID IF YOU REALLY HELD YOUR BREATH THAT LONG WHY 'D YOU COME OUT OF THE WATER DRY
DavidBlaine_2009P@1170.02:1170.63 WHAT
DavidBlaine_2009P@1172.43:1173.83 AND THAT'S MY LIFE SO
DavidBlaine_2009P@1179.35:1192.14 AS A MAGICIAN I TRY TO SHOW THINGS TO PEOPLE THAT SEEM IMPOSSIBLE AND I THINK MAGIC WHETHER I'M HOLDING MY BREATH OR SHUFFLING A DECK OF CARDS IS PRETTY SIMPLE IT'S PRACTICE IT'S TRAINING AND
DavidBlaine_2009P@1194.85:1202.09 IT'S PRACTICE IT'S TRAINING AND EXPERIMENTING WHILE PUSHING THROUGH THE PAIN TO BE THE BEST THAT I CAN BE AND
DavidBlaine_2009P@1203.42:1203.91 THAT'S WHAT
