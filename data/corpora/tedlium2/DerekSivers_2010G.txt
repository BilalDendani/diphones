DerekSivers_2010G@17.04:26.93 PLEASE THINK OF YOUR BIGGEST PERSONAL GOAL FOR REAL YOU CAN TAKE A SECOND YOU'VE GOT TO FEEL THIS TO LEARN IT TAKE A FEW SECONDS AND THINK OF YOUR PERSONAL BIGGEST GOAL OKAY
DerekSivers_2010G@45.29:58.83 WELL BAD NEWS YOU SHOULD HAVE KEPT YOUR MOUTH SHUT BECAUSE THAT GOOD FEELING NOW WILL MAKE YOU LESS LIKELY TO DO IT REPEATED PSYCHOLOGY TESTS HAVE PROVEN THAT TELLING SOMEONE YOUR GOAL MAKES IT LESS LIKELY TO HAPPEN
DerekSivers_2010G@68.22:76.67 BUT WHEN YOU TELL SOMEONE YOUR GOAL AND THEY ACKNOWLEDGE IT PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT'S CALLED A SOCIAL REALITY THE MIND IS KIND OF TRICKED INTO FEELING THAT IT'S ALREADY DONE
DerekSivers_2010G@77.04:83.44 AND THEN BECAUSE YOU'VE FELT THAT SATISFACTION YOU'RE LESS MOTIVATED TO DO THE ACTUAL HARD WORK NECESSARY
DerekSivers_2010G@84.19:91.71 SO THIS GOES AGAINST THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT WE SHOULD TELL OUR FRIENDS OUR GOALS RIGHT SO THEY HOLD US TO IT YEAH SO
DerekSivers_2010G@103.33:110.50 EIGHTY TWO PETER GOLLWITZER WROTE A WHOLE BOOK ABOUT THIS AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE HE DID SOME NEW TESTS THAT WERE PUBLISHED IT GOES LIKE THIS
DerekSivers_2010G@123.03:130.47 THEN EVERYONE WAS GIVEN FORTY FIVE MINUTES OF WORK THAT WOULD DIRECTLY LEAD THEM TOWARDS THEIR GOAL BUT THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEY COULD STOP AT ANY TIME NOW THOSE WHO KEPT
DerekSivers_2010G@131.68:139.39 WORKED THE ENTIRE FORTY FIVE MINUTES ON AVERAGE AND WHEN ASKED AFTERWARDS SAID THAT THEY FELT THAT THEY HAD A LONG WAY TO GO STILL TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOAL
DerekSivers_2010G@139.88:151.42 BUT THOSE WHO HAD ANNOUNCED IT QUIT AFTER ONLY THIRTY THREE MINUTES ON AVERAGE AND WHEN ASKED AFTERWARDS SAID THAT THEY FELT MUCH CLOSER TO ACHIEVING THEIR GOAL SO IF THIS IS TRUE WHAT CAN WE DO
DerekSivers_2010G@153.07:160.25 RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO ANNOUNCE YOUR GOAL YOU CAN DELAY THE GRATIFICATION THAT THE SOCIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BRINGS
DerekSivers_2010G@160.81:170.84 AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR MIND MISTAKES THE TALKING FOR THE DOING BUT IF YOU DO NEED TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING YOU CAN STATE IT IN A WAY THAT GIVES YOU NO SATISFACTION
DerekSivers_2010G@172.00:183.88 SUCH AS I REALLY WANT TO RUN THIS MARATHON SO I NEED TO TRAIN FIVE TIMES A WEEK AND KICK MY ASS IF I DON 'T OKAY SO AUDIENCE NEXT TIME YOU'RE TEMPTED TO TELL SOMEONE YOUR GOAL WHAT WILL YOU SAY EXACTLY WELL
