EdwardBurtynsky_2005@13.31:15.51 WALK AROUND FOR FOUR MONTHS WITH
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@16.36:24.95 THREE WISHES AND ALL THE IDEAS WILL START TO PERCOLATE UP I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD DO IT THINK THAT YOU'VE GOT THREE WISHES AND WHAT WOULD YOU DO IT'S ACTUALLY A GREAT EXERCISE TO REALLY
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@25.33:33.67 DRILL DOWN TO THE THINGS THAT YOU FEEL ARE IMPORTANT AND REALLY REFLECT ON THE WORLD AROUND US AND THINKING THAT CAN AN INDIVIDUAL
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@43.75:49.16 THE THEME HERE AND I THINK QUITE FRANKLY THAT'S WHERE I STARTED
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@50.45:60.52 I BECAME VERY INTERESTED IN THE LANDSCAPE AS A CANADIAN WE HAVE THIS GREAT NORTH AND THERE WAS A PRETTY SMALL POPULATION AND MY FATHER WAS AN AVID OUTDOORSMAN
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@68.52:70.83 TELLING ME IS THAT WE ARE THIS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@72.57:80.91 THING THAT'S HAPPENING AND THAT THE NATURE THAT YOU SEE OUT THERE THE UNTOUCHED SHORELINES THE UNTOUCHED FOREST THAT I WAS ABLE TO SEE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@81.64:89.27 REALLY BRING IN A SENSE OF THAT GEOLOGICAL TIME THAT THIS HAS GONE ON
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@89.38:101.07 FOR A LONG TIME AND WE'RE EXPERIENCING IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND THAT TO ME WAS A REFERENCE POINT THAT I THINK I NEEDED TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE WORK THAT I DID
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@101.35:114.14 AND I DID GO OUT AND I DID THIS PICTURE OF GRASSES COMING THROUGH IN THE SPRING ALONG A ROADSIDE THIS REBIRTH OF GRASS AND THEN I WENT OUT FOR YEARS TRYING TO PHOTOGRAPH THE PRISTINE LANDSCAPE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@114.85:124.54 BUT AS A FINE ART PHOTOGRAPHER I SOMEHOW FELT THAT IT WOULDN'T CATCH ON OUT THERE THAT THERE WOULD BE A PROBLEM WITH TRYING TO MAKE THIS AS A FINE ART CAREER AND I KEPT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@125.10:134.43 BEING SUCKED INTO THIS GENRE OF THE CALENDAR PICTURE OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE AND I COULDN'T GET AWAY FROM IT SO I STARTED TO THINK OF HOW CAN I RETHINK THE LANDSCAPE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@134.79:141.99 I DECIDED TO RETHINK THE LANDSCAPE AS THE LANDSCAPE THAT WE'VE TRANSFORMED I HAD A BIT OF AN EPIPHANY BEING LOST IN PENNSYLVANIA AND I TOOK A
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@185.26:185.84 AND JUST
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@212.02:218.60 SO IN THAT RESPECT TO ME I'M NOT AGAINST THE CORPORATION I OWN A CORPORATION I
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@219.40:225.51 WORK WITH THEM AND I FEEL THAT WE ALL NEED THEM AND THEY'RE IMPORTANT BUT I AM ALSO FOR SUSTAINABILITY SO THERE'S THIS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@226.32:234.85 THING THAT IS PULLING ME IN BOTH DIRECTIONS AND I'M NOT MAKING AN INDICTMENT TOWARDS WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE BUT IT IS A SLOW PROGRESSION SO
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@235.20:248.27 I STARTING THINKING WELL WE LIVE IN ALL THESE AGES OF MAN THE STONE AGE AND THE IRON AGE AND THE COPPER AGE AND THESE AGES OF MAN ARE STILL AT WORK TODAY BUT WE'VE BECOME TOTALLY DISCONNECTED FROM THEM THERE'S SOMETHING THAT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@249.04:259.33 WE'RE NOT SEEING THERE AND IT'S A SCARY THING AS WELL BECAUSE WHEN WE START LOOKING AT THE COLLECTIVE APPETITE FOR OUR LIFESTYLES AND WHAT WE'RE DOING TO THAT LANDSCAPE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@260.06:272.24 THAT TO ME IS SOMETHING THAT IS A VERY SOBERING MOMENT FOR ME TO CONTEMPLATE AND THROUGH MY PHOTOGRAPHS I'M HOPING TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE THE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@287.52:297.51 AND IT'S THAT FORBIDDEN PLEASURE THAT I THINK IS WHAT RESONATES OUT THERE AND IT GETS PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THESE THINGS AND IT GETS PEOPLE TO ENTER IT AND IT ALSO IN A WAY DEFINES
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@298.58:306.76 KIND OF WHAT I FEEL TOO IS THAT I'M DRAWN TO HAVE A GOOD LIFE I WANT A HOUSE AND I WANT A CAR BUT THERE'S THIS CONSEQUENCE OUT THERE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@307.14:315.91 AND HOW DO I BEGIN TO HAVE THAT ATTRACTION REPULSION IT'S EVEN IN MY OWN CONSCIENCE I'M HAVING IT AND HERE IN MY WORK I'M TRYING TO BUILD THAT SAME TOGGLE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@339.80:350.23 IN THE RECYCLING WORK THAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE WAS STARTING TO POINT TO A DIRECTION TO ME IT WAS OUR REDEMPTION THAT IN THE RECYCLING WORK THAT I WAS DOING I'M LOOKING FOR
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@361.23:375.03 EXISTENCE BACK INTO THE SYSTEM IF WE KEEP DOING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE ON OF COURSE LISTENING AT THE CONFERENCE THERE'S MANY MANY THINGS THAT ARE COMING BIO MIMICRY AND THERE'S MANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE COMING ONSTREAM NANOTECHNOLOGY THAT MAY ALSO
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@386.92:393.89 LOOKING AT HERE I WENT TO BANGLADESH SO I STARTED TO MOVE AWAY FROM NORTH AMERICA I STARTED TO LOOK AT OUR WORLD GLOBALLY
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@394.27:400.49 AND THIS CAME ABOUT THESE IMAGES OF BANGLADESH CAME OUT OF A RADIO PROGRAM I WAS LISTENING TO THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT EXXON
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@411.43:417.85 MY GOD WOULDN'T THAT BE SOMETHING TO SEE THE LARGEST VESSELS OF MAN BEING DECONSTRUCTED BY HAND LITERALLY IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@419.00:427.04 GO TO INDIA AND I WAS SHUT OUT OF INDIA BECAUSE OF A GREENPEACE SITUATION THERE AND THEN I WAS ABLE TO GET INTO BANGLADESH AND SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@429.24:433.36 THIRD WORLD A VIEW OF IT THAT I HAD NEVER ACTUALLY THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@443.14:450.50 HERE YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOME OIL FIELDS IN CALIFORNIA SOME OF THE BIGGEST OIL FIELDS AND AGAIN I STARTED TO THINK THAT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@466.48:473.40 SERIES I'M HOPING TO HAVE READY IN ABOUT TWO OR THREE YEARS KIND OF UNDER THE HEADING OF THE OIL PARTY BECAUSE I THINK EVERYTHING THAT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@474.07:480.52 WE'RE INVOLVED IN OUR CLOTHING OUR CARS OUR ROADS AND EVERYTHING ARE DIRECTLY A RESULT I'M GOING TO
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@481.32:489.48 TO SOME PICTURES OF CHINA AND THROUGH CHINA I STARTED PHOTOGRAPHING IT FOUR YEARS AGO AND CHINA TRULY IS A QUESTION OF SUSTAINABILITY IN MY MIND
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@489.83:498.77 NOT TO MENTION THAT CHINA AS WELL HAS A GREAT EFFECT ON THE INDUSTRIES THAT I GREW UP AROUND BECAUSE I CAME OUT OF A BLUE COLLAR TOWN A GM TOWN
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@499.38:506.61 AND MY FATHER WORKED AT GM SO I WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT KIND OF INDUSTRY AND THAT ALSO INFORMED MY WORK
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@507.14:514.07 BUT YOU KNOW TO SEE CHINA AND THE SCALE AT WHICH IT'S EVOLVING IS QUITE SOMETHING
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@515.15:528.59 WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS THE THREE GORGES DAM AND THIS IS THE LARGEST DAM BY FIFTY PERCENT EVER ATTEMPTED BY MAN AND MOST OF THE ENGINEERS AROUND THE WORLD LEFT THE PROJECT BECAUSE THEY SAID IT 'S JUST TOO BIG
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@529.55:538.52 IN FACT WHEN IT DID ACTUALLY FILL WITH WATER A YEAR AND A HALF AGO THEY WERE ABLE TO MEASURE A WOBBLE WITHIN THE EARTH AS IT WAS SPINNING IT TOOK FIFTEEN DAYS TO FILL IT SO
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@538.82:546.18 THIS CREATED A RESERVOIR SIX HUNDRED KILOMETERS LONG ONE OF THE LARGEST RESERVOIRS EVER CREATED AND
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@546.75:554.17 WHAT WAS ALSO ONE OF THE BIGGER PROJECTS AROUND THAT WAS MOVING THIRTEEN FULL SIZE CITIES UP OUT OF THE RESERVOIR
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@554.28:562.42 AND FLATTENING ALL THE BUILDINGS SO THEY COULD MAKE WAY FOR THE SHIPS THIS IS A BEFORE AND AFTER SO THAT WAS BEFORE AND THIS IS LIKE TEN WEEKS LATER
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@563.07:575.66 DEMOLISHED BY HAND I THINK ELEVEN OF THE BUILDINGS THEY USED DYNAMITE EVERYTHING ELSE WAS BY HAND THAT WAS TEN WEEKS LATER AND THIS GIVES YOU AN IDEA AGAIN WITH AND IT WAS ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THOSE HOMES WERE THE ONES THAT WERE ACTUALLY TAKING IT APART AND WORKING
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@585.10:594.08 DAM LOOKING AT THAT MASSIVE TRANSFORMATION OF A LANDSCAPE AND IT LOOKS LIKE A BOMBED OUT LANDSCAPE BUT IT ISN 'T WHAT IT IS IT'S A LANDSCAPE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@594.62:600.80 THAT IS AN INTENTIONAL ONE THIS IS A NEED FOR POWER AND THEY'RE WILLING TO GO THROUGH THIS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@601.94:606.63 MASSIVE TRANSFORMATION ON THIS SCALE TO GET THAT POWER
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@608.34:613.25 AND AGAIN IT'S ACTUALLY A RELIEF FOR WHAT'S GOING ON
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@613.75:626.55 CHINA BECAUSE I THINK ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW THERE'S TWENTY SEVEN NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS TO BE BUILT THERE HASN'T BEEN ONE BUILT IN NORTH AMERICA FOR TWENTY YEARS BECAUSE OF THE NIMBY PROBLEM NOT IN MY BACKYARD BUT IN CHINA THEY'RE SAYING NO WE'RE PUTTING IN TWENTY SEVEN IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@627.18:637.04 AND COAL BURNING FURNACES ARE GOING IN THERE FOR HYDROELECTRIC POWER LITERALLY WEEKLY SO COAL ITSELF IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE LARGEST
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@643.57:654.07 ON THE LEFT WAS ALSO LOST SOME OF THE MOST FERTILE AGRICULTURAL LAND WAS LOST IN THAT AND AT ONE POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE WERE RELOCATED DEPENDING ON WHOSE STATISTICS YOU'RE LOOKING AT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@655.05:663.42 AND THIS IS WHAT THEY WERE BUILDING THIS IS WUSHAN ONE OF THE LARGEST CITIES THAT WAS RELOCATED THIS IS THE CENTRAL HEADQUARTERS OR THE TOWN HALL FOR THE CITY
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@664.01:675.03 AND AGAIN THE REBUILDING OF THE CITY TO ME IT WAS SAD TO SEE THAT THEY DIDN'T REALLY GRAB A LOT OF I GUESS WHAT WE KNOW HERE IN TERMS OF URBAN PLANNING THERE WERE NO PARKS THERE WERE NO GREEN SPACES
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@675.64:684.75 VERY HIGH DENSITY LIVING ON THE SIDE OF A HILL AND HERE THEY HAD A CHANCE TO REBUILD CITIES FROM THE BOTTOM UP BUT SOMEHOW WE'RE NOT CONNECTING WITH THEM
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@685.60:694.44 HERE IS A SIGN THAT TRANSLATED SAYS OBEY THE BIRTH CONTROL LAW BUILD OUR SCIENCE CIVILIZED AND ADVANCED IDEA OF MARRIAGE AND GIVING BIRTH SO
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@694.91:701.30 HERE IF YOU LOOK AT THIS POSTER IT HAS ALL THE TRAPPINGS OF WESTERN CULTURE YOU'RE SEEING
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@702.23:710.30 THE TUXEDOS THE BOUQUETS BUT WHAT'S REALLY TO ME FRIGHTENING ABOUT THE PICTURE AND ABOUT THIS BILLBOARD IS THE REFINERY IN THE BACKGROUND SO IT'S LIKE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@711.54:719.50 ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE AND IT'S AN ADAPTATION OF OUR WAY OF LIFE FULL STOP AND
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@720.10:727.10 AGAIN WHEN YOU START SEEING THAT KIND OF EMBRACE AND YOU START LOOKING AT THEM LEADING
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@740.69:747.55 GUANGDONG AND THIS IS WHERE A LOT OF MIGRANT WORKERS ARE COMING IN FROM THE COUNTRY AND THERE'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@756.52:764.13 TO MIGRATE INTO THE URBAN CENTERS LIKE SHANGHAI AND THE MANUFACTURING CENTERS THE MANUFACTURERS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@765.05:778.22 ARE THE DOMESTICS ARE USUALLY YOU CAN TELL A DOMESTIC FACTORY BY THE FACT THAT THEY ALL USE THE SAME COLOR UNIFORMS SO THIS IS A PINK UNIFORM AT THIS FACTORY IT'S A SHOE FACTORY AND THEY HAVE DORMS FOR THE WORKERS SO THEY BRING THEM IN FROM THE COUNTRY AND PUT THEM UP IN THE DORMS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@779.38:787.76 THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST SHOE FACTORIES THE YUYUAN SHOE FACTORY NEAR SHENZHEN IT HAS NINETY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES MAKING SHOES
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@788.51:795.72 THIS IS A SHIFT CHANGE ONE OF THREE AT EVERY CHANGE THERE'S TWO FACTORIES OF THIS SCALE IN THE SAME TOWN THIS IS ONE WITH FORTY FIVE THOUSAND SO
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@796.22:803.80 EVERY LUNCH THERE'S ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND COMING THROUGH FOR LUNCH THEY SIT DOWN THEY HAVE ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES THE NEXT ROUND COMES IN IT'S AN INCREDIBLE WORKFORCE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@804.57:816.30 THAT'S BUILDING THERE SHANGHAI I'M LOOKING AT THE URBAN RENEWAL IN SHANGHAI AND THIS IS A WHOLE AREA THAT WILL BE FLATTENED AND TURNED INTO SKYSCRAPERS IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@817.53:826.60 WHAT'S ALSO HAPPENING IN SHANGHAI IS CHINA IS CHANGING BECAUSE THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED FIVE YEARS AGO FOR INSTANCE THIS IS A HOLDOUT THEY'RE CALLED DENGZAHOOS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@827.14:835.24 LIKE PIN TACKS TO THE GROUND THEY WON 'T MOVE THEY'RE NOT NEGOTIATING THEY'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE AND SO THEY'RE HOLDING OFF UNTIL
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@835.56:845.76 THEY GET A DEAL WITH THEM AND THEY'VE BEEN ACTUALLY QUITE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING BETTER DEALS BECAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE GETTING A RAW DEAL THEY'RE BEING PUT OUT ABOUT TWO HOURS THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@856.72:864.45 IN THIS RECONSTRUCTION OF SHANGHAI PROBABLY THE LARGEST URBAN RENEWAL PROJECT I THINK EVER ATTEMPTED ON THE PLANET
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@866.52:869.34 AND THEN THE EMBRACE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE REPLACING IT WITH
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@882.05:891.56 QUITE SOMETHING AND THESE ARE CALLED THE VILLAS AND ALSO LIKE RIGHT NOW THEY'RE JUST MOVING THE SCAFFOLDING IS STILL ON AND THIS IS AN E WASTE AREA
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@891.91:900.87 AND IF YOU LOOKED IN THE FOREGROUND ON THE BIG PRINT YOU'D SEE THAT THE INDUSTRY THEIR INDUSTRY THEY'RE ALL RECYCLING SO THE INDUSTRY 'S ALREADY GROWING AROUND THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@902.16:909.70 IS A FIVE LEVEL BRIDGE IN SHANGHAI SHANGHAI WAS A VERY INTRIGUING CITY IT'S EXPLODING ON A LEVEL
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@910.69:922.94 THAT I DON'T THINK ANY CITY HAS EXPERIENCED IN FACT EVEN SHENZHEN THE INDUSTRIAL OR THE ECONOMIC ZONE ONE OF THE FIRST ONES FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@932.26:939.23 WITH WHICH THIS IS JUST THE TAXIS BEING BUILT BY VOLKSWAGEN THERE'S NINE THOUSAND OF THEM HERE AND THEY'RE BEING BUILT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@940.09:951.46 FOR MOST OF THE BIG CITIES BEIJING AND SHANGHAI SHENZHEN AND THIS ISN'T EVEN THE DOMESTIC CAR MARKET THIS IS THE TAXI MARKET
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@953.38:959.68 AND WHAT WE WOULD SEE HERE AS KIND OF A SUBURBAN KIND OF DEVELOPMENT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@969.46:977.17 SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING WOULD GO UP HERE IN AN AREA AND THE DENSITY IS QUITE INCREDIBLE AND ONE OF THE THINGS IN
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@977.39:980.33 THIS PICTURE THAT I WANTED TO POINT OUT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@980.82:982.21 IS THAT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@984.11:993.01 WHEN I SAW THESE KINDS OF BUILDINGS I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THAT THEY'RE NOT USING A CENTRAL AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM EVERY WINDOW
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@993.38:1001.68 HAS AN AIR CONDITIONER IN IT AND I'M SURE THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE WHO PROBABLY KNOW BETTER THAN I DO ABOUT EFFICIENCIES BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1002.16:1010.16 THAT EVERY APARTMENT HAVING ITS OWN AIR CONDITIONER IS A VERY EFFICIENT WAY TO COOL A BUILDING ON THIS SCALE AND WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT THAT AND THEN YOU START FACTORING UP INTO
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1010.82:1020.20 A CITY THE SIZE OF SHANGHAI IT'S LITERALLY A FOREST OF SKYSCRAPERS IT'S BREATHTAKING IN TERMS OF THE SPEED AT WHICH THIS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1030.29:1040.86 AND HIGH RISES ARE NOW GOING UP INTO THAT CENTRAL SPOT SO A SKYSCRAPER IS BUILT LITERALLY OVERNIGHT IN SHANGHAI
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1056.73:1063.39 IT'S AN INCREDIBLY MASSIVE OPERATION I THINK FIFTEEN THOUSAND WORKERS FIVE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1064.73:1071.44 AND THE SIXTH ONE 'S COMING IN HERE SO THEY'RE BUILDING VERY LARGE BLAST FURNACES
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1072.09:1081.26 TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THE DEMAND FOR STEEL IN CHINA SO THIS IS THREE OF THE VISIBLE BLAST FURNACES WITHIN THAT SHOT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1081.64:1088.74 AND AGAIN LOOKING AT THESE IMAGES THERE'S THIS CONSTANT LIKE HAZE THAT YOU'RE SEEING THIS IS GOING TO SHOW YOU REAL
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1089.95:1094.88 AN ASSEMBLER IT'S A CIRCUIT BREAKER
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1126.90:1127.20 THAT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1127.52:1135.18 WE HERE ARE FACING WITH CHINA IS THAT THEY'RE USING A LOT OF THE LATEST PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY IN THAT ONE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1135.27:1144.32 THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT WORKED ON THE FLOOR AND I ASKED THE MANAGER TO POINT OUT FIVE OF YOUR FASTEST PRODUCERS AND THEN I WENT AND LOOKED AT EACH ONE OF THEM
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1144.54:1152.09 FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES AND PICKED THIS ONE WOMAN AND IT WAS JUST LIGHTNING FAST THE WAY SHE WAS WORKING WAS ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1152.52:1160.43 THAT IS THE TRICK THAT THEY'VE GOT RIGHT NOW THAT THEY'RE WINNING WITH IS THAT THEY'RE USING ALL THE LATEST TECHNOLOGIES AND EXTRUSION MACHINES AND
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1161.66:1169.45 ALL THE COMPONENTS INTO PLAY BUT THE ASSEMBLY IS WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY BRINGING IN THE COUNTRY WORKERS ARE VERY
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1170.57:1180.36 WILLING TO WORK THEY WANT TO WORK THERE'S A MASSIVE BACKLOG OF PEOPLE WANTING THEIR JOBS THAT CONDITION 'S GOING TO BE THERE FOR THE NEXT TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS IF THEY
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1190.31:1195.72 TO USE A VERY SMALL APERTURE TO GET THE DEPTH OF FIELD I HAD TO HAVE THEM FREEZE FOR TEN SECONDS TO GET THIS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1197.88:1209.51 IT TOOK ME FIVE FAKE TRIES BECAUSE THEY WERE JUST GOING TO SLOW THEM DOWN WAS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE THEY WERE JUST WOUND UP DOING THESE THINGS ALL DAY LONG UNTIL THE MANAGER HAD TO WITH A STERN VOICE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1210.53:1220.99 EVERYBODY FREEZE IT WASN'T TOO BAD BUT THEY'RE DRIVEN TO PRODUCE THESE THINGS AT AN INCREDIBLE RATE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1228.18:1231.39 AND WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE IS AGAIN ONE OF THE MOST STATE OF THE ART
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1241.13:1249.16 THE MACHINES ARE ALL RUNNING ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE TO SEE WHAT THE SCALE OF INDUSTRIES ARE AND I STARTED GETTING IN FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1249.65:1260.79 THE FACTORIES AND THAT'S A DIPTYCH SO I DO A LOT OF PAIRINGS TO TRY AND GET THE SENSE OF SCALE IN THESE PLACES THIS IS A LINE WHERE THEY GET THE THREADS AND THEY WIND THE THREADS TOGETHER
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1273.04:1281.49 HUNDRED WORKERS ON THIS FLOOR THE COMPANY ITSELF HAD ABOUT TEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND THEY'RE DOING DOMESTIC SHOES
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1281.78:1296.01 IT WAS VERY HARD TO GET INTO THE INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES BECAUSE I HAD TO GET PERMISSION FROM COMPANIES LIKE NIKE AND ADIDAS AND THAT'S VERY HARD TO GET AND THEY DON'T WANT TO LET ME IN BUT THE DOMESTIC WAS MUCH EASIER TO DO IT JUST GIVES YOU A SENSE OF AGAIN
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1296.65:1304.54 AND THAT'S WHERE REALLY THE WHOLE MIGRATION OF JOBS STARTED GOING OVER TO CHINA AND MAKING THE SHOES NIKE WAS ONE OF THE EARLY ONES AND IT WAS REALLY
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1305.89:1312.36 IT WAS SUCH A HIGH LABOR COMPONENT TO IT THAT IT MADE A LOT OF SENSE TO GO AFTER THAT LABOR MARKET THIS IS A
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1313.06:1321.67 HIGH TECH MOBILE PHONE BIRD MOBILE PHONE ONE OF THE LARGEST MOBILE MAKERS IN CHINA I THINK MOBILE PHONE COMPANIES ARE POPPING UP LITERALLY
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1322.09:1329.07 ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND THEY HAVE AN EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN MOBILE PHONES THIS IS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1330.06:1335.35 A TEXTILE WHERE THEY'RE DOING SHIRTS YOUNGOR THE BIGGEST SHIRT FACTORY AND CLOTHING FACTORY IN CHINA
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1335.49:1347.54 AND THIS NEXT SHOT HERE IS ONE OF THE LUNCHROOMS EVERYTHING IS VERY EFFICIENT WHILE SETTING UP THIS SHOT PEOPLE ON AVERAGE WOULD SPEND EIGHT TO TEN MINUTES HAVING A LUNCH
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1351.13:1358.03 THIS WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST FACTORIES I'VE EVER SEEN THEY MAKE COFFEEMAKERS HERE THE BIGGEST COFFEEMAKER
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1358.80:1367.00 AND THE BIGGEST IRON MAKERS THEY MAKE TWENTY MILLION OF THEM IN THE WORLD THERE'S TWENTY ONE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES THIS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1368.08:1376.42 ONE FACTORY AND THEY HAD SEVERAL OF THEM IS HALF A KILOMETER LONG THESE ARE JUST RECENTLY SHOT I JUST CAME BACK ABOUT A MONTH AGO SO YOU'RE THE FIRST ONES TO BE SEEING THESE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1378.83:1385.25 THESE NEW FACTORY PICTURES I'VE TAKEN SO IT'S TAKEN ME ALMOST A YEAR TO GAIN ACCESS INTO THESE PLACES
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1386.88:1397.31 THE OTHER ASPECT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CHINA IS THAT THERE'S A REAL NEED FOR MATERIALS THERE SO A LOT OF THE RECYCLED MATERIALS THAT ARE COLLECTED HERE ARE BEING RECYCLED AND TAKEN TO CHINA
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1397.87:1408.28 BY SHIPS THAT'S CUBED METAL THIS IS ARMATURES ELECTRICAL ARMATURES WHERE THEY'RE GETTING THE COPPER AND THE HIGH END STEEL FROM ELECTRICAL MOTORS OUT AND RECYCLING THEM
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1409.33:1418.41 THIS IS CERTAINLY CONNECTED TO CALIFORNIA AND SILICON VALLEY BUT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO MOST OF THE COMPUTERS FIFTY PERCENT OF THE WORLD 'S COMPUTERS END UP IN CHINA TO BE RECYCLED
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1419.72:1429.96 IT'S REFERRED TO AS E WASTE THERE AND IT IS A BIT OF A PROBLEM THE WAY THEY RECYCLE THE BOARDS IS THAT THEY ACTUALLY USE THE COAL BRIQUETTES WHICH ARE USED ALL THROUGH CHINA
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1430.23:1437.95 BUT THEY HEAT UP THE BOARDS AND WITH PAIRS OF PLIERS THEY PULL OFF ALL THE COMPONENTS THEY'RE TRYING TO GET ALL THE VALUED METALS OUT OF THOSE COMPONENTS BUT THE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1438.36:1446.02 TOXIC SMELLS WHEN YOU COME INTO A TOWN THAT'S ACTUALLY DOING THIS KIND OF BURNING OF THE BOARDS YOU CAN SMELL IT A GOOD FIVE OR TEN KILOMETERS BEFORE YOU GET THERE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1446.74:1454.91 HERE 'S ANOTHER OPERATION IT'S ALL COTTAGE INDUSTRIES SO IT'S NOT BIG PLACES IT'S ALL IN PEOPLE 'S FRONT PORCHES IN
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1456.33:1469.44 THEIR BACKYARDS EVEN IN THEIR HOMES THEY'RE BURNING BOARDS IF THERE'S A CONCERN FOR SOMEBODY COMING BY BECAUSE IT IS CONSIDERED IN CHINA TO BE ILLEGAL DOING IT BUT THEY CAN'T STOP THE PRODUCT FROM COMING
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1470.46:1480.36 THIS PORTRAIT I'M NOT USUALLY KNOWN FOR PORTRAITS BUT I COULDN'T RESIST THIS ONE WHERE SHE'S BEEN THROUGH MAO AND SHE'S BEEN THROUGH THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD AND THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1495.44:1506.59 TO SHOW YOU I WANT TO DEDICATE MY WISHES TO MY TWO GIRLS THEY'VE BEEN SITTING ON MY SHOULDER THE WHOLE TIME WHILE I'VE BEEN THINKING ONE 'S MEGAN THE ONE OF THE RIGHT AND KATJA THERE AND
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1506.81:1515.06 TO ME THE WHOLE NOTION THE THINGS I'M PHOTOGRAPHING ARE OF GREAT CONCERN ABOUT THE SCALE OF OUR PROGRESS AND WHAT WE CALL PROGRESS AND
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1515.63:1525.39 AS MUCH AS THERE ARE GREAT THINGS AROUND THE CORNER AND IT'S PALPABLE IN THIS ROOM OF ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE JUST ABOUT TO BREAK THAT CAN SOLVE SO MANY PROBLEMS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1526.41:1537.82 I'M REALLY HOPING THAT THOSE THINGS WILL SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD AND WILL START TO HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT AND IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT ISN'T JUST AFFECTING OUR WORLD BUT IT STARTS TO GO UP BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN START CORRECTING OUR FOOTPRINT AND
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1538.42:1540.19 IT DOWN BUT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1541.43:1553.59 THERE'S A GROWING FOOTPRINT THAT'S HAPPENING IN ASIA AND IS GROWING AT A RAPID RAPID RATE AND SO I DON'T THINK WE CAN EQUALIZE IT SO ULTIMATELY THE STRATEGY I THINK HERE IS THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY CONCERNED
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1554.18:1562.09 ABOUT THEIR EVOLUTION BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE CONNECTED TO OUR EVOLUTION AS WELL SO PART OF MY THINKING AND PART OF MY WISHES IS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1562.46:1574.73 SITTING WITH THESE THOUGHTS IN MIND AND THINKING ABOUT HOW IS THEIR LIFE GOING TO BE WHEN THEY WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN OR WHEN THEY'RE READY TO GET MARRIED TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW OR WHATEVER FIFTEEN YEARS FROM NOW AND TO ME THAT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1575.09:1582.00 HAS BEEN THE CORE BEHIND MOST OF MY THINKING IN MY WORK AND ALSO FOR THIS INCREDIBLE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1582.63:1593.17 CHANCE TO HAVE SOME WISHES WISH ONE WORLD CHANGING I WANT TO USE MY IMAGES TO PERSUADE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO JOIN IN THE GLOBAL
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1601.61:1604.44 IDEA OH AND I WENT IN SEARCH I WANTED TO PUT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1605.29:1618.82 WHAT I HAD IN MIND HITCH IT ONTO SOMETHING I DIDN'T WANT A WISH JUST TO START FROM NOWHERE ONE OF THEM I'M STARTING FROM ALMOST NOTHING BUT THE OTHER ONE I WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON THAT'S WORKING RIGHT NOW AND WORLDCHANGING COM IS A FANTASTIC BLOG
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1619.81:1622.03 AND THAT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1624.42:1631.81 IS NOW BEING VISITED BY CLOSE TO HALF A MILLION PEOPLE A MONTH AND IT JUST STARTED ABOUT FOURTEEN
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1633.01:1641.99 MONTHS AGO AND THE BEAUTY OF WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IS THAT THE TONE OF THE CONVERSATION IS THE TONE THAT I LIKE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1642.44:1656.07 WHAT THEY'RE DOING THERE IS THAT THEY'RE NOT I THINK THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT HAS FAILED IN THAT IT'S USED THE STICK TOO MUCH IT'S USED THE APOCALYPTIC TONE TOO MUCH IT HASN'T SOLD THE POSITIVE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1665.65:1678.69 ABOUT POSITIVE MOVEMENTS ABOUT HOW TO CHANGE OUR WORLD IN A BETTER WAY QUICKLY AND IT'S LOOKING AT TECHNOLOGY AND IT'S LOOKING AT NEW ENERGY SAVING DEVICES AND IT'S LOOKING AT HOW TO RETHINK AND HOW TO RE STRATEGIZE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1679.84:1686.70 THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY AND SO FOR ME ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1687.90:1696.83 PUT SOME OF MY WORK IN THE SERVICE OF PROMOTING THE WORLDCHANGING COM WEBSITE SOME OF YOU MIGHT KNOW
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1699.48:1709.32 AND I ARE WORKING ON SOME LAYOUTS AND THIS IS STILL IN PRELIMINARY STAGES THESE AREN'T THE FINALS BUT THESE IMAGES WITH WORLDCHANGING COM
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1709.91:1717.54 CAN BE PLACED INTO ANY KIND OF MEDIA THEY COULD BE POSTED THROUGH THE WEB THEY COULD BE USED AS A
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1719.49:1726.76 BILLBOARD OR A BUS SHELTER OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AS TRYING TO BUILD OUT AND WHAT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1727.91:1736.40 DISCUSSING WAS THAT IN MOST MEDIA YOU GET MOSTLY AN IMAGE WITH A LOT OF TEXT AND THE TEXT IS BLASTED ALL OVER WHAT WAS UNUSUAL
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1737.63:1743.59 LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT OF ADS ARE ACTUALLY LEADING WITH IMAGE AND SO IN THIS CASE BECAUSE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1744.67:1755.86 IT'S ABOUT A LOT OF THESE IMAGES AND WHAT THEY REPRESENT AND THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THEY BRING UP THAT WE THOUGHT LETTING THE IMAGES PLAY OUT AND BRING SOMEONE TO SAY WELL WHAT'S WORLDCHANGING COM WITH THESE IMAGES
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1757.01:1764.54 HAVE TO DO AND HOPEFULLY INSPIRE PEOPLE TO GO TO THAT WEBSITE SO WORLDCHANGING COM
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1764.91:1773.99 AND BUILDING THAT BLOG AND IT IS A BLOG AND I'M HOPING THAT IT ISN'T I DON'T SEE IT AS THE KIND OF BLOG WHERE WE'RE ALL GOING TO FOLLOW EACH OTHER TO DEATH THIS ONE IS ONE THAT WILL SPOKE OUT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1774.44:1787.52 AND WILL GO OUT AND TO START REACHING BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S CONVERSATIONS IN INDIA IN CHINA IN SOUTH AMERICA THERE'S ENTRIES COMING FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD I THINK THERE'S A CHANCE TO HAVE A DIALOGUE A CONVERSATION ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1799.65:1807.74 A GROUNDBREAKING COMPETITION THAT MOTIVATES KIDS TO INVEST IDEAS ON AND INVENT IDEAS ON SUSTAINABILITY
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1808.98:1817.43 AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME OUT ALLISON WHO ACTUALLY NOMINATED ME SAID SOMETHING EARLIER ON IN A BRAINSTORMING SHE SAID THAT RECYCLING IN CANADA HAD A FANTASTIC ENTRY
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1818.10:1825.89 INTO OUR PSYCHE THROUGH KIDS BETWEEN GRADE FOUR AND SIX AND YOU THINK ABOUT IT
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1827.69:1834.23 MY WIFE AND I WE SAY AGE SEVEN IS THE AGE OF REASON SO THEY'RE INTO THE AGE OF REASON AND THEY'RE PRE PUBERTY SO
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1834.46:1843.16 THIS GREAT WINDOW WHERE THEY ACTUALLY ARE YOU CAN INFLUENCE THEM YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AT PUBERTY YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT FROM EARLIER PRESENTATIONS SO MY
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1844.12:1849.24 THINKING HERE IS THAT WE TRY TO MOTIVATE THOSE KIDS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1849.71:1859.15 TO START DRIVING HOME IDEAS LET THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT SUSTAINABILITY IS AND THAT THEY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN IT TO HAPPEN AND ONE OF THE WAYS I THOUGHT OF DOING IT IS TO
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1873.86:1880.86 PRIZE TARGETS AND SO ONE COULD BE FOR THE BEST SUSTAINABLE IDEA FOR AN IN SCHOOL PROJECT THE BEST ONE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1882.63:1894.99 FOR A HOUSEHOLD PROJECT OR IT COULD BE THE BEST COMMUNITY PROJECT FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND I ALSO THOUGHT THERE SHOULD BE A NICE PRIZE FOR THE BEST ARTWORK FOR IN MY WORLD AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IT'S A SCALABLE THING AND
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1896.88:1905.48 IF WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO PUT IN THINGS WHETHER IT'S EQUIPMENT LIKE A MEDIA LAB OR MONEY TO MAKE THE PRIZE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH AND TO OPEN IT UP TO ALL
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1905.61:1913.16 THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OR SCHOOLS THAT ARE WITH KIDS THAT AGE AND MAKE IT A WIDE OPEN COMPETITION FOR THEM
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1913.63:1926.24 TO GO AFTER THOSE PRIZES AND TO SUBMIT THEM AND THE PRIZE HAS TO BE A VERIFIABLE THING SO IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST IDEAS THE ART PIECES ARE ABOUT THE IDEAS AND HOW THEY PRESENT THEM AND DO THEM BUT THE ACTUAL THINGS HAVE TO BE VERIFIABLE
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1926.80:1935.62 THAT WAY WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT WE'RE MOTIVATING A CERTAIN AGE GROUP TO START THINKING AND THEY'RE GOING TO PUSH THAT UP FROM THE BOTTOM UP INTO
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1936.10:1946.02 I BELIEVE INTO THE HOUSEHOLDS AND PARENTS WILL BE REACTING TO IT AND TRYING TO HELP THEM WITH THE PROJECTS AND I THINK IT STARTS TO MOTIVATE THE WHOLE IDEA TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1946.74:1957.09 IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY AND STARTS TO TEACH THEM THEY KNOW ABOUT RECYCLING NOW BUT THEY DON'T REALLY I THINK GET SUSTAINABILITY IN ALL THE THINGS AND THE ENERGY FOOTPRINT AND HOW THAT MATTERS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1957.62:1965.33 AND TO TEACH THEM TO ME WOULD BE A FANTASTIC WISH AND IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT I WOULD CERTAINLY PUT MY SHOULDER INTO
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1965.99:1974.83 AND AGAIN IN MY WORLD THE COMPETITION WE WOULD USE THE ARTWORK THAT COMES IN FROM THAT COMPETITION TO PROMOTE IT AND I LIKE THE WORDS IN MY WORLD BECAUSE IT GIVES POSSESSION
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1975.36:1983.43 OF THE WORLD TO THE PERSON WHO 'S DOING IT IT IS MY WORLD IT'S NOT SOMEONE ELSE 'S I WANT TO HELP IT I WANT TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT SO I THINK IT HAS
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1983.82:1991.34 A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE THE IMAGINATIONS AND GREAT IDEAS I THINK COME FROM KIDS AND ENGAGE THEIR IMAGINATION
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1991.73:1998.95 INTO A PROJECT AND DO SOMETHING FOR SCHOOLS I THINK ALL SCHOOLS COULD USE EXTRA EQUIPMENT EXTRA CASH IT'S GOING TO BE AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@1999.58:2010.88 TO DO THAT AND THESE ARE SOME OF THE IDEAS IN TERMS OF WHERE WE COULD POSSIBLY PUT IN SOME PROMOTION FOR IN MY WORLD AND
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@2012.34:2023.26 IMAX FILM SO I WAS TOLD I SHOULD DO ONE FOR MYSELF AND I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO ACTUALLY GET INVOLVED WITH DOING SOMETHING AND THE SCALE OF MY WORK AND THE KINDS OF IDEAS I'M PLAYING WITH
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@2023.95:2033.60 WHEN I FIRST SAW AN IMAX FILM I ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT THERE 'S A REAL RESONANCE BETWEEN WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO AND THE SCALE OF WHAT I TRY TO DO AS A PHOTOGRAPHER AND I THINK THERE'S A REAL POSSIBILITY
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@2034.19:2048.43 TO MAKE A POWERFUL TO REACH NEW AUDIENCES IF I HAD A CHANCE SO I'M LOOKING REALLY FOR A MENTOR BECAUSE I JUST HAD MY BIRTHDAY I'M FIFTY AND I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL RIGHT NOW I'M TOO BUSY SO I NEED SOMEBODY WHO CAN PUT ME ON A QUICK
EdwardBurtynsky_2005@2049.15:2058.42 CATCH UP COURSE ON HOW TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND LEAD ME THROUGH THE MAZE OF HOW ONE DOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC SO THOSE ARE MY THREE WISHES
