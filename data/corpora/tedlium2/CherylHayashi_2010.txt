CherylHayashi_2010@17.45:19.39 AND HOW MUCH WE CAN LEARN FROM THEM
CherylHayashi_2010@19.92:26.13 SPIDERS ARE TRULY GLOBAL CITIZENS YOU CAN FIND SPIDERS IN NEARLY EVERY TERRESTRIAL HABITAT
CherylHayashi_2010@26.39:34.23 THIS RED DOT MARKS THE GREAT BASIN OF NORTH AMERICA AND I 'M INVOLVED WITH AN ALPINE BIODIVERSITY PROJECT THERE WITH SOME COLLABORATORS
CherylHayashi_2010@34.72:36.44 HERE 'S ONE OF OUR FIELD SITES
CherylHayashi_2010@36.79:45.3 AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF PERSPECTIVE THIS LITTLE BLUE SMUDGE HERE THAT 'S ONE OF MY COLLABORATORS THIS IS A RUGGED AND BARREN LANDSCAPE
CherylHayashi_2010@53.41:71.03 SPIDERS ARE NOT JUST EVERYWHERE BUT THEY 'RE EXTREMELY DIVERSE THERE ARE OVER FORTY THOUSAND DESCRIBED SPECIES OF SPIDERS TO PUT THAT NUMBER INTO PERSPECTIVE HERE 'S A GRAPH COMPARING THE FORTY THOUSAND SPECIES OF SPIDERS TO THE FOUR HUNDRED SPECIES OF PRIMATES THERE ARE TWO ORDERS
CherylHayashi_2010@105.92:109.5 ALL SPIDERS MAKE SILK AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFE
CherylHayashi_2010@109.76:116.26 MOST SPIDERS USE COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF SILK AND SILK IS ESSENTIAL TO THEIR SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION
CherylHayashi_2010@116.73:131.26 EVEN FOSSIL SPIDERS CAN MAKE SILK AS WE CAN SEE FROM THIS IMPRESSION OF A SPINNERET ON THIS FOSSIL SPIDER SO THIS MEANS THAT BOTH SPIDERS AND SPIDER SILK HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION YEARS
CherylHayashi_2010@133.02:141.11 IT DOESN 'T TAKE LONG FROM WORKING WITH SPIDERS TO START NOTICING HOW ESSENTIAL SILK IS TO JUST ABOUT EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR LIFE
CherylHayashi_2010@141.44:145.15 SPIDERS USE SILK FOR MANY PURPOSES INCLUDING
CherylHayashi_2010@145.31:147.3 THE TRAILING SAFETY DRAGLINE
CherylHayashi_2010@147.63:153.04 WRAPPING EGGS FOR REPRODUCTION PROTECTIVE RETREATS AND CATCHING PREY
CherylHayashi_2010@154.01:167.55 THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF SPIDER SILK FOR EXAMPLE THIS GARDEN SPIDER CAN MAKE SEVEN DIFFERENT KINDS OF SILKS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS ORB WEB YOU 'RE ACTUALLY SEEING MANY TYPES OF SILK FIBERS THE FRAME AND RADII OF THIS WEB
CherylHayashi_2010@183.6:198.46 TO ANSWER THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK A LOT CLOSER AT THE SPINNERET REGION OF A SPIDER SO SILK COMES OUT OF THE SPINNERETS AND FOR THOSE OF US SPIDER SILK BIOLOGISTS THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE BUSINESS END OF THE SPIDER LAUGHTER WE SPEND LONG DAYS HEY DON 'T LAUGH THAT 'S MY LIFE
CherylHayashi_2010@227.76:230.14 WITH A LOT OF SILK PROTEINS STUCK INSIDE
CherylHayashi_2010@230.43:236.52 SO IF YOU EVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISSECT AN ORB WEB WEAVING SPIDER AND I HOPE YOU DO
CherylHayashi_2010@243.28:247.17 INSIDE EACH SPIDER THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF SILK GLANDS SOMETIMES
CherylHayashi_2010@253.26:268.01 AND SOMETIMES EVEN COLOR IN AN ORB WEB WEAVING SPIDER YOU CAN FIND SEVEN TYPES OF SILK GLANDS AND WHAT I HAVE DEPICTED HERE IN THIS PICTURE LET 'S START AT THE ONE O 'CLOCK POSITION THERE 'S TUBULIFORM SILK GLANDS WHICH ARE USED TO MAKE THE OUTER SILK OF AN EGG SAC
CherylHayashi_2010@268.01:282.19 THERE 'S THE AGGREGATE AND FLAGELLIFORM SILK GLANDS WHICH COMBINE TO MAKE THE STICKY CAPTURE SPIRAL OF AN ORB WEB PYRIFORM SILK GLANDS MAKE THE ATTACHMENT CEMENT THAT 'S THE SILK THAT 'S USED TO ADHERE SILK LINES TO A SUBSTRATE
CherylHayashi_2010@283.03:299.54 THERE 'S ALSO ACINIFORM SILK WHICH IS USED TO WRAP PREY MINOR AMPULLATE SILK IS USED IN WEB CONSTRUCTION AND THE MOST STUDIED SILK LINE OF THEM ALL MAJOR AMPULLATE SILK THIS IS THE SILK THAT 'S USED TO MAKE THE FRAME AND RADII OF AN ORB WEB AND ALSO THE SAFETY TRAILING DRAGLINE
CherylHayashi_2010@300.3:303.7 BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS SPIDER SILK
CherylHayashi_2010@304.8:308.21 SPIDER SILK IS ALMOST ENTIRELY PROTEIN
CherylHayashi_2010@308.84:324.65 NEARLY ALL OF THESE PROTEINS CAN BE EXPLAINED BY A SINGLE GENE FAMILY SO THIS MEANS THAT THE DIVERSITY OF SILK TYPES WE SEE TODAY IS ENCODED BY ONE GENE FAMILY SO PRESUMABLY THE ORIGINAL SPIDER ANCESTOR MADE ONE KIND OF SILK
CherylHayashi_2010@336.14:340.27 THE LARGE VARIETY OF FLAVORS OF SPIDER SILKS THAT WE HAVE TODAY
CherylHayashi_2010@341.44:351.94 THERE ARE SEVERAL FEATURES THAT ALL THESE SILKS HAVE IN COMMON THEY ALL HAVE A COMMON DESIGN SUCH AS THEY 'RE ALL VERY LONG THEY 'RE SORT OF OUTLANDISHLY LONG COMPARED TO OTHER
CherylHayashi_2010@366.82:368.73 FROM THE BLACK WIDOW SPIDER
CherylHayashi_2010@369.16:386.57 THIS IS THE KIND OF SEQUENCE THAT I LOVE LOOKING AT DAY AND NIGHT LAUGHTER SO WHAT YOU 'RE SEEING HERE IS THE ONE LETTER ABBREVIATION FOR AMINO ACIDS AND I 'VE COLORED IN THE GLYCINES WITH GREEN AND THE ALANINES IN RED AND SO YOU CAN SEE IT 'S JUST A LOT OF G 'S AND A 'S YOU CAN ALSO SEE
CherylHayashi_2010@405.03:407.38 AND THESE WORDS OCCUR IN SENTENCES
CherylHayashi_2010@407.41:421.91 SO FOR EXAMPLE THIS WOULD BE ONE SENTENCE AND YOU WOULD GET THIS SORT OF GREEN REGION AND THE RED POLYALANINE THAT REPEATS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND YOU CAN HAVE THAT HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF TIMES WITHIN AN INDIVIDUAL SILK MOLECULE
CherylHayashi_2010@423.11:425.27 SILKS MADE BY THE SAME SPIDER
CherylHayashi_2010@457.4:463 THEY ALSO DIFFER IN SEQUENCE SO I 'VE COLORED IN THE GLYCINES AGAIN IN GREEN ALANINE IN RED
CherylHayashi_2010@484.85:490.53 IT 'S REALLY CONVENIENT THAT SPIDERS USE THEIR SILK COMPLETELY OUTSIDE THEIR BODY THIS MAKES
CherylHayashi_2010@490.78:509.52 TESTING SPIDER SILK REALLY REALLY EASY TO DO IN THE LABORATORY BECAUSE WE 'RE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW TESTING IT IN AIR THAT 'S EXACTLY THE ENVIRONMENT THAT SPIDERS ARE USING THEIR SILK PROTEINS SO THIS MAKES QUANTIFYING SILK PROPERTIES BY METHODS SUCH AS TENSILE TESTING WHICH IS BASICALLY YOU KNOW TUGGING ON ONE END OF THE FIBER VERY AMENABLE
CherylHayashi_2010@518.55:523.97 SO WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THAT THE FIVE FIBERS HAVE DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS
CherylHayashi_2010@523.97:539.18 SPECIFICALLY IF YOU LOOK ON THE VERTICAL AXIS THAT 'S STRESS IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAXIMUM STRESS VALUE FOR EACH OF THESE FIBERS YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE 'S A LOT OF VARIATION AND IN FACT DRAGLINE OR MAJOR AMPULLATE SILK IS THE STRONGEST OF THESE FIBERS
CherylHayashi_2010@539.54:546.57 WE THINK THAT 'S BECAUSE THE DRAGLINE SILK WHICH IS USED TO MAKE THE FRAME AND RADII FOR A WEB NEEDS TO BE VERY STRONG
CherylHayashi_2010@546.97:565.21 ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT STRAIN THIS IS HOW MUCH A FIBER CAN BE EXTENDED IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAXIMUM VALUE HERE AGAIN THERE 'S A LOT OF VARIATION AND THE CLEAR WINNER IS FLAGELLIFORM OR THE CAPTURE SPIRAL FILAMENT IN FACT THIS FLAGELLIFORM FIBER CAN ACTUALLY STRETCH OVER TWICE ITS ORIGINAL LENGTH
CherylHayashi_2010@565.54:568.38 SO SILK FIBERS VARY IN THEIR STRENGTH
CherylHayashi_2010@585.51:596.41 AN INSECT IS VERY LIKELY TO JUST BOUNCE RIGHT OFF BUT BY HAVING REALLY REALLY STRETCHY CAPTURE SPIRAL SILK THE WEB IS ACTUALLY ABLE TO ABSORB THE IMPACT OF THAT INTERCEPTED PREY
CherylHayashi_2010@597.07:599.49 THERE 'S QUITE A BIT OF VARIATION
CherylHayashi_2010@608.37:621.54 BUT HOW ABOUT VARIATION AMONG SPIDER SPECIES SO LOOKING AT ONE TYPE OF SILK AND LOOKING AT DIFFERENT SPECIES OF SPIDERS THIS IS AN AREA THAT 'S LARGELY UNEXPLORED BUT HERE 'S A LITTLE BIT OF DATA I CAN SHOW YOU
CherylHayashi_2010@637.69:642.55 SHOULD HAVE THE TOUGHEST DRAGLINE SILKS BECAUSE THEY MUST INTERCEPT FLYING PREY
CherylHayashi_2010@643.2:645.94 WHAT YOU SEE HERE ON THIS TOUGHNESS GRAPH
CherylHayashi_2010@657.8:661.05 AND I 'VE COLORED IN YELLOW THE ORB WEB WEAVING SPIDERS
CherylHayashi_2010@700.33:715.39 A WEB AT ALL TO CATCH PREY INSTEAD SCYTODES SORT OF LURKS AROUND AND WAITS FOR PREY TO GET CLOSE TO IT AND THEN IMMOBILIZES PREY BY SPRAYING A SILK LIKE VENOM ONTO THAT INSECT THINK OF HUNTING WITH SILLY STRING
CherylHayashi_2010@718.97:723.23 WE DON 'T REALLY KNOW WHY SCYTODES NEEDS SUCH A TOUGH DRAGLINE
CherylHayashi_2010@724.4:730.84 BUT IT 'S UNEXPECTED RESULTS LIKE THIS THAT MAKE BIO PROSPECTING SO EXCITING AND WORTHWHILE
CherylHayashi_2010@731.03:734.23 IT FREES US FROM THE CONSTRAINTS OF OUR IMAGINATION
CherylHayashi_2010@739.92:742.78 BOMBYX OR DOMESTICATED SILKWORM SILK
CherylHayashi_2010@750.42:751.94 IT 'S THE COMBINATION
CherylHayashi_2010@756.55:764.85 THAT MAKES SPIDER SILK SO SPECIAL AND THAT HAS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF BIOMIMETICISTS SO PEOPLE THAT TURN TO NATURE TO TRY TO FIND NEW SOLUTIONS
CherylHayashi_2010@783.66:787.68 FOR SERVING AS GUIDES TO REGROW NERVES
CherylHayashi_2010@791.61:797.12 SPIDER SILKS ALSO HAVE A LOT OF POTENTIAL FOR THEIR ANTI BALLISTIC CAPABILITIES
CherylHayashi_2010@797.19:805.49 SILKS COULD BE INCORPORATED INTO BODY AND EQUIPMENT ARMOR THAT WOULD BE MORE LIGHTWEIGHT AND FLEXIBLE THAN ANY ARMOR AVAILABLE TODAY
CherylHayashi_2010@806.64:808.65 IN ADDITION TO THESE
CherylHayashi_2010@808.69:811.99 BIOMIMETIC APPLICATIONS OF SPIDER SILKS
CherylHayashi_2010@812.49:816.09 PERSONALLY I FIND STUDYING SPIDER SILKS JUST
CherylHayashi_2010@816.18:818.42 FASCINATING IN AND OF ITSELF
CherylHayashi_2010@823.08:825.72 A NEW SPIDER SILK SEQUENCE COMES IN
CherylHayashi_2010@826.12:828.19 THAT 'S JUST
CherylHayashi_2010@834.2:837.37 AND THAT 'S WHY I 'M GOING TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE STUDYING SPIDER SILK
CherylHayashi_2010@837.71:839.72 THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE A SPIDER WEB
CherylHayashi_2010@839.93:843.17 PLEASE PAUSE AND LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER
CherylHayashi_2010@849.79:853.03 TO BORROW FROM THE WRITINGS OF A SPIDER NAMED CHARLOTTE
CherylHayashi_2010@853.32:856.27 SILK IS TERRIFIC THANK YOU
