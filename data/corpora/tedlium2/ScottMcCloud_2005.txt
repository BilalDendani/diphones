ScottMcCloud_2005@15.90:25.71 THE FIVE SENSES VISION IS THE ONE THAT I APPRECIATE THE MOST AND IT'S THE ONE THAT I CAN LEAST TAKE FOR GRANTED I THINK THIS IS PARTIALLY DUE TO MY FATHER WHO WAS BLIND
ScottMcCloud_2005@25.92:32.38 IT WAS A FACT THAT HE DIDN'T MAKE MUCH OF A FUSS ABOUT USUALLY ONE TIME IN NOVA SCOTIA WHEN WE WENT TO SEE A TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN
ScottMcCloud_2005@33.24:45.92 SAME ONE AS IN THE CARLY SIMON SONG WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT REFER TO JAMES TAYLOR WARREN BEATTY OR MICK JAGGER WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE THEY HANDED OUT THESE DARK PLASTIC VIEWERS THAT ALLOWED US TO LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN WITHOUT DAMAGING OUR EYES
ScottMcCloud_2005@55.92:61.62 I THOUGHT THIS WAS A LITTLE STRANGE AT THE TIME WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW AT THE TIME WAS THAT MY FATHER HAD ACTUALLY BEEN BORN WITH PERFECT EYESIGHT
ScottMcCloud_2005@62.56:72.72 WHEN HE AND HIS SISTER MARTHA WERE JUST VERY LITTLE THEIR MOM TOOK THEM OUT TO SEE A TOTAL ECLIPSE OR ACTUALLY A SOLAR ECLIPSE AND NOT LONG AFTER THAT BOTH OF THEM STARTED LOSING THEIR EYESIGHT
ScottMcCloud_2005@73.89:82.32 DECADES LATER IT TURNED OUT THAT THE SOURCE OF THEIR BLINDNESS WAS MOST LIKELY SOME SORT OF BACTERIAL INFECTION AS NEAR AS WE CAN TELL IT HAD NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO
ScottMcCloud_2005@82.72:88.52 WITH THAT SOLAR ECLIPSE BUT BY THEN MY GRANDMOTHER HAD ALREADY GONE TO HER GRAVE THINKING IT WAS HER FAULT
ScottMcCloud_2005@113.50:119.91 REAL MILITARISTIC KIND OF GUY HE JUST REALLY FELT BAD THAT HE WASN'T ABLE TO FIGHT IN WORLD WAR II ON ACCOUNT OF HIS HANDICAP
ScottMcCloud_2005@120.26:128.24 ALTHOUGH THEY DID LET HIM GET THROUGH THE SEVERAL HOUR LONG ARMY PHYSICAL EXAM BEFORE THEY GOT TO THE VERY LAST TEST WHICH WAS FOR VISION
ScottMcCloud_2005@131.61:141.67 SO DAD STARTED RACKING UP ALL OF THESE PATENTS AND GAINING A REPUTATION AS A BLIND GENIUS ROCKET SCIENTIST INVENTOR BUT TO US HE WAS JUST DAD AND OUR HOME LIFE WAS PRETTY NORMAL
ScottMcCloud_2005@158.61:171.58 SO HERE 'S MY DAD HE 'S A SCIENTIST HE 'S AN ENGINEER AND HE 'S A MILITARY CONTRACTOR SO HE HAS FOUR KIDS RIGHT ONE GROWS UP TO BECOME A COMPUTER SCIENTIST ONE GROWS UP TO JOIN THE NAVY
ScottMcCloud_2005@172.13:175.27 ONE GROWS UP TO BECOME AN ENGINEER AND THEN THERE'S ME
ScottMcCloud_2005@175.99:177.28 THE COMIC BOOK ARTIST
ScottMcCloud_2005@193.75:202.68 THE FUNNY THING IS DAD HAD A LOT OF FAITH IN ME HE HAD FAITH IN MY ABILITIES AS A CARTOONIST EVEN THOUGH HE HAD NO DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT I WAS ANY GOOD WHATSOEVER EVERYTHING HE SAW WAS JUST A BLUR
ScottMcCloud_2005@202.93:209.16 NOW THIS GIVES A REAL MEANING TO THE TERM BLIND FAITH WHICH DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME NEGATIVE CONNOTATION FOR ME THAT IT DOES FOR OTHER PEOPLE
ScottMcCloud_2005@209.95:223.29 NOW FAITH IN THINGS WHICH CANNOT BE SEEN WHICH CANNOT BE PROVED IS NOT THE SORT OF FAITH THAT I'VE EVER REALLY RELATED TO ALL THAT MUCH I TEND TO LIKE SCIENCE WHERE WHAT WE SEE AND CAN ASCERTAIN ARE THE FOUNDATION OF WHAT WE KNOW
ScottMcCloud_2005@233.29:241.63 NOBODY REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WAS THAT HE HAD IN MIND EXCEPT FOR ADA LOVELACE AND HE WENT TO HIS GRAVE TRYING TO PURSUE THAT DREAM
ScottMcCloud_2005@243.32:248.97 WITH HIS MEMEX THIS IDEA OF ALL OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE AT YOUR FINGERTIPS HE HAD THIS VISION
ScottMcCloud_2005@249.41:256.96 AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE IN HIS DAY PROBABLY THOUGHT HE WAS A BIT OF A KOOK AND YEAH WE CAN LOOK BACK IN RETROSPECT AND SAY YEAH HA HA YOU KNOW IT'S ALL MICROFILM BUT THAT'S
ScottMcCloud_2005@270.36:279.39 IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WOULD ONLY BE IMPLEMENTED BY PEOPLE MUCH LATER OR PAUL BARRON AND HIS VISION FOR PACKET SWITCHING HARDLY ANYBODY LISTENED TO HIM IN HIS DAY
ScottMcCloud_2005@280.17:292.68 OR EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY PULLED IT OFF THE PEOPLE AT BOLT BERANEK AND NEWMAN IN BOSTON WHO JUST WOULD SKETCH OUT THESE STRUCTURES OF WHAT WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME A WORLDWIDE NETWORK AND SKETCHING THINGS ON THE BACK OF NAPKINS AND ON
ScottMcCloud_2005@306.23:316.73 MY DAD 'S BIG EASY CHAIR YOU KNOW SO THREE TYPES OF VISION RIGHT VISION BASED ON WHAT ONE CANNOT SEE THE VISION OF THAT UNSEEN AND UNKNOWABLE
ScottMcCloud_2005@317.05:330.29 THE VISION OF THAT WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN PROVEN OR CAN BE ASCERTAINED AND THIS THIRD KIND OF VISION OF SOMETHING WHICH CAN BE WHICH MAY BE BASED ON KNOWLEDGE BUT IS AS YET UNPROVEN
ScottMcCloud_2005@330.89:338.50 NOW WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PURSUING THAT SORT OF VISION IN SCIENCE BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO TRUE IN THE ARTS IT'S TRUE IN POLITICS IT'S EVEN TRUE IN
ScottMcCloud_2005@346.25:357.35 WATCH FOR PATTERNS AND WORK LIKE HELL I THINK THESE ARE THE FOUR PRINCIPLES THAT GO INTO THIS AND IT'S THAT THIRD ONE ESPECIALLY WHERE VISIONS OF THE FUTURE BEGIN TO MANIFEST THEMSELVES
ScottMcCloud_2005@357.80:371.95 WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT THIS PARTICULAR WAY OF LOOKING AT THE WORLD IS I THINK ONLY ONE OF FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS THAT MANIFEST THEMSELVES IN DIFFERENT FIELDS OF ENDEAVOR IN COMICS I KNOW THAT IT RESULTS IN SORT OF A FORMALIST ATTITUDE TOWARDS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS
ScottMcCloud_2005@372.35:382.06 THEN THERE'S ANOTHER MORE CLASSICAL ATTITUDE WHICH EMBRACES BEAUTY AND CRAFT ANOTHER ONE WHICH BELIEVES IN THE PURE TRANSPARENCY OF CONTENT AND THEN ANOTHER
ScottMcCloud_2005@382.29:397.17 WHICH EMPHASIZES THE AUTHENTICITY OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE AND HONESTY AND RAWNESS THESE ARE FOUR VERY DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT THE WORLD I EVEN GAVE THEM NAMES THE CLASSICIST THE ANIMIST AND FORMALIST AND ICONOCLAST INTERESTINGLY IT SEEMED TO CORRESPOND MORE OR LESS TO JUNG 'S FOUR SUBDIVISIONS OF HUMAN THOUGHT
ScottMcCloud_2005@399.03:408.88 AND THEY REFLECT A DICHOTOMY OF ART AND DELIGHT ON LEFT AND THE RIGHT TRADITION AND REVOLUTION ON THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM AND IF YOU GO ON THE DIAGONAL YOU GET CONTENT AND FORM AND THEN BEAUTY AND TRUTH
ScottMcCloud_2005@409.10:415.65 AND IT PROBABLY APPLIES JUST AS MUCH TO MUSIC AND TO MOVIES AND TO FINE ART WHICH HAS NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH VISION AT ALL
ScottMcCloud_2005@416.54:427.48 OR FOR THAT MATTER NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR CONFERENCE THEME OF INSPIRED BY NATURE EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OF THE FABLE OF THE FROG WHO GIVES THE RIDE TO THE SCORPION ON HIS BACK TO GET ACROSS THE RIVER BECAUSE THE SCORPION PROMISES NOT TO
ScottMcCloud_2005@437.39:437.60 SO
ScottMcCloud_2005@440.33:449.29 SO THIS WAS MY NATURE THE THING WAS I SAW THAT THE ROUTE THAT I TOOK TO DISCOVERING THIS FOCUS IN MY WORK AND WHO I WAS
ScottMcCloud_2005@450.38:459.32 I SAW IT AS JUST THIS ROAD TO DISCOVERY ACTUALLY IT WAS JUST ME EMBRACING MY NATURE WHICH MEANS THAT I DIDN'T ACTUALLY FALL THAT FAR FROM THE TREE AFTER ALL
ScottMcCloud_2005@460.98:467.42 SO WHAT DOES A SCIENTIFIC MIND DO IN THE ARTS WELL I STARTED MAKING COMICS
ScottMcCloud_2005@479.55:488.16 THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF COMICS LIKE PICTURES AND WORDS AND THE DIFFERENT SYMBOLS AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN THAT COMICS PRESENTS ARE ALL FUNNELED THROUGH THE SINGLE CONDUIT OF VISION
ScottMcCloud_2005@488.88:499.18 SO YOU HAVE THINGS LIKE RESEMBLANCE WHERE SOMETHING WHICH RESEMBLES THE PHYSICAL WORLD CAN BE ABSTRACTED IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS ABSTRACTED FROM RESEMBLANCE BUT STILL RETAINING THE COMPLETE MEANING
ScottMcCloud_2005@499.48:508.61 OR ABSTRACTED AWAY FROM BOTH RESEMBLANCE AND MEANING TOWARDS THE PICTURE PLAN PUT ALL THESE THREE TOGETHER AND YOU HAVE A NICE LITTLE MAP OF THE ENTIRE BOUNDARY OF VISUAL ICONOGRAPHY
ScottMcCloud_2005@510.40:518.06 AND IF YOU MOVE TO THE RIGHT YOU ALSO GET LANGUAGE BECAUSE THAT'S ABSTRACTING EVEN FURTHER FROM RESEMBLANCE BUT STILL MAINTAINING MEANING
ScottMcCloud_2005@519.03:533.43 VISION IS CALLED UPON TO REPRESENT SOUND AND TO UNDERSTAND THE COMMON PROPERTIES OF THOSE TWO AND THEIR COMMON HERITAGE AS WELL ALSO TO TRY TO REPRESENT THE TEXTURE OF SOUND TO CAPTURE ITS ESSENTIAL CHARACTER THROUGH VISUALS
ScottMcCloud_2005@548.59:560.52 ALSO ANOTHER SENSE WHICH COMICS VISION REPRESENTS AND THAT'S TIME SEQUENCE IS A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF COMICS COMICS PRESENTS A KIND OF TEMPORAL MAP
ScottMcCloud_2005@561.41:571.95 AND THIS TEMPORAL MAP WAS SOMETHING THAT ENERGIZES MODERN COMICS BUT I WAS WONDERING IF PERHAPS IT ALSO ENERGIZES OTHER SORTS OF FORMS AND I FOUND SOME IN HISTORY AND
ScottMcCloud_2005@572.03:580.60 YOU CAN SEE THIS SAME PRINCIPLE OPERATING IN THESE ANCIENT VERSIONS OF THE SAME IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE ART FORM IS COLLIDING WITH THE GIVEN TECHNOLOGY
ScottMcCloud_2005@580.93:587.04 WHETHER IT'S PAINT ON STONE LIKE THE TOMB OF THE SCRIBE IN ANCIENT EGYPT OR A BAS RELIEF SCULPTURE RISING UP A STONE COLUMN
ScottMcCloud_2005@608.23:611.43 AND WITHIN ONE HUNDRED YEARS YOU ALREADY START TO SEE WORD
ScottMcCloud_2005@635.97:646.24 AND SO I KEPT MY EYES PEELED TO SEE IF THE SORT OF CHANGES THAT HAPPENED WHEN WE WENT FROM PRE PRINT COMICS TO PRINT COMICS WOULD HAPPEN WHEN WE WENT BEYOND TO POST PRINT COMICS
ScottMcCloud_2005@646.74:656.11 SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT WERE PROPOSED WAS THAT WE COULD MIX THE VISUALS OF COMICS WITH THE SOUND MOTION AND INTERACTIVITY OF THE CD ROMISS THAT WERE BEING MADE IN THOSE DAYS THIS WAS EVEN BEFORE THE WEB
ScottMcCloud_2005@674.97:682.10 THE PROBLEM WAS THAT IF YOU GO WITH THIS IDEA THIS BASIC IDEA THAT SPACE EQUALS TIME IN COMICS WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN YOU INTRODUCE
ScottMcCloud_2005@682.35:691.56 SOUND AND MOTION WHICH ARE TEMPORAL PHENOMENA THAT CAN ONLY BE REPRESENTED THROUGH TIME THEN THEY BREAK WITH THAT CONTINUITY OF PRESENTATION
ScottMcCloud_2005@700.90:708.01 THE DISTANCE FROM ABRAHAM LINCOLN TO A LINCOLN PENNY THE PENNY MARSHALL TO THE MARSHALL PLAN TO PLAN NINE TO NINE LIVES IT'S ALL THE SAME
ScottMcCloud_2005@709.13:720.68 AND BUT IN COMICS IN COMICS EVERY ASPECT OF THE WORK EVERY ELEMENT OF THE WORK HAS A SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP TO EVERY OTHER ELEMENT AT ALL TIMES SO THE QUESTION WAS WAS THERE ANY WAY
ScottMcCloud_2005@720.82:734.26 TO PRESERVE THAT SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP WHILE STILL TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF THE THINGS THAT DIGITAL HAD TO OFFER US AND I FOUND MY PERSONAL ANSWER FOR THIS IN THOSE ANCIENT COMICS THAT I WAS SHOWING YOU EACH OF THEM HAS A SINGLE UNBROKEN READING LINE
ScottMcCloud_2005@734.72:739.64 WHETHER IT'S GOING ZIGZAG ACROSS THE WALLS OR SPIRALING UP A COLUMN OR JUST STRAIGHT LEFT TO RIGHT
ScottMcCloud_2005@739.97:752.86 OR EVEN GOING IN A BACKWARDS ZIGZAG ACROSS THOSE EIGHTY EIGHT ACCORDION FOLDED PAGES THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING AND THAT IS THAT THE BASIC IDEA THAT AS YOU MOVE THROUGH SPACE YOU MOVE THROUGH TIME IS BEING CARRIED OUT WITHOUT ANY COMPROMISE BUT THERE WERE COMPROMISES WHEN PRINT HIT
ScottMcCloud_2005@761.99:768.09 IF THAT'S TRUE IS THERE ANY WAY WHEN WE GO BEYOND TODAY 'S PRINT TO SOMEHOW BRING THAT BACK
ScottMcCloud_2005@769.55:776.93 NOW THE MONITOR IS JUST AS LIMITED AS THE PAGE TECHNICALLY RIGHT IT'S A DIFFERENT SHAPE BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT'S THE SAME
ScottMcCloud_2005@777.21:784.47 BASIC LIMITATION BUT THAT'S ONLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE MONITOR AS A PAGE BUT NOT IF YOU LOOK AT THE MONITOR AS A WINDOW
ScottMcCloud_2005@794.18:806.07 WE COULD DO CIRCULAR NARRATIVES THAT WERE LITERALLY CIRCULAR WE COULD DO A TURN IN A STORY THAT WAS LITERALLY A TURN PARALLEL NARRATIVES COULD BE LITERALLY PARALLEL X Y AND ALSO Z
ScottMcCloud_2005@818.12:821.56 THIS WAS AN EARLY COLLAGE COMIC BY A FELLOW NAMED JASON LEX
ScottMcCloud_2005@832.52:840.07 HEAD INTO THIS NEW ERA WE ARE LOOKING FOR MUTATIONS THAT ARE DURABLE THAT HAVE SOME SORT OF STAYING POWER
ScottMcCloud_2005@840.70:850.53 NOW WE'RE TAKING THIS BASIC IDEA OF PRESENTING COMICS IN A VISUAL MEDIUM AND THEN WE'RE CARRYING IT THROUGH ALL THE WAY FROM BEGINNING TO END THAT'S THAT ENTIRE COMIC YOU JUST SAW IS UP ON THE SCREEN RIGHT NOW
ScottMcCloud_2005@865.57:876.31 ADAPT TO ITS ENVIRONMENT IT'S A DURABLE MUTATION HERE 'S ANOTHER ONE I'LL SHOW YOU THIS IS BY DOCTOREW WEING THIS IS CALLED POP CONTEMPLATES THE HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE
ScottMcCloud_2005@901.48:902.98 SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
ScottMcCloud_2005@903.97:906.88 AS WE DRAW THESE STORIES ON AN INFINITE CANVAS
ScottMcCloud_2005@909.24:911.60 IS YOU'RE CREATING A MORE PURE EXPRESSION
ScottMcCloud_2005@912.41:914.08 OF WHAT THIS MEDIUM IS ALL ABOUT
ScottMcCloud_2005@958.28:960.87 I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE MEDIA
ScottMcCloud_2005@961.79:966.68 ALL MEDIA PROVIDE US A WINDOW BACK INTO OUR WORLD NOW
ScottMcCloud_2005@966.76:981.44 IT COULD BE THAT MOTION PICTURES AND EVENTUALLY VIRTUAL REALITY OR SOMETHING EQUIVALENT TO IT SOME SORT OF IMMERSIVE DISPLAY IS GOING TO PROVIDE US WITH OUR MOST EFFICIENT ESCAPE FROM THE WORLD THAT WE'RE IN THAT'S WHY MOST PEOPLE TURN TO STORYTELLING IS TO ESCAPE
ScottMcCloud_2005@982.09:992.72 MEDIA PROVIDES US WITH A WINDOW BACK INTO THE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN AND WHEN MEDIA EVOLVE SO THAT
ScottMcCloud_2005@993.21:1003.18 THE IDENTITY OF THE MEDIA BECOMES INCREASINGLY UNIQUE BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS YOU'RE LOOKING AT COMICS CUBED YOU'RE LOOKING AT COMICS THAT ARE MORE COMICS LIKE THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE
ScottMcCloud_2005@1003.50:1010.46 WHEN THAT HAPPENS YOU PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE WAYS OF RE ENTERING THE WORLD THROUGH DIFFERENT WINDOWS
ScottMcCloud_2005@1010.68:1020.35 AND WHEN YOU DO THAT IT ALLOWS THEM TO TRIANGULATE THE WORLD THAT THEY LIVE IN AND SEE ITS SHAPE AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT ONE OF MANY REASONS BUT I'VE GOT TO GO NOW THANK YOU FOR HAVING
