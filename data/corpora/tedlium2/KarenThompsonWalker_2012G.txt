KarenThompsonWalker_2012G AS THEIR SHIP BEGAN TO SINK BENEATH THE SWELLS THE MEN HUDDLED TOGETHER IN THREE SMALL WHALEBOATS THESE MEN WERE TEN THOUSAND MILES FROM HOME MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND MILES FROM THE NEAREST SCRAP OF LAND
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G IN THEIR SMALL BOATS THEY CARRIED ONLY RUDIMENTARY NAVIGATIONAL EQUIPMENT AND LIMITED SUPPLIES OF FOOD AND WATER
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G THESE WERE THE MEN OF THE WHALESHIP ESSEX WHOSE STORY WOULD LATER INSPIRE PARTS OF MOBY DICK EVEN IN TODAY 'S WORLD THEIR SITUATION WOULD BE REALLY DIRE BUT THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH WORSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THEN NO ONE ON LAND HAD ANY IDEA THAT ANYTHING HAD GONE WRONG NO SEARCH PARTY WAS COMING TO LOOK FOR THESE MEN
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G SO MOST OF US HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED A SITUATION AS FRIGHTENING AS THE ONE IN WHICH THESE SAILORS FOUND THEMSELVES BUT WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT 'S LIKE TO BE AFRAID WE KNOW HOW FEAR FEELS BUT I 'M NOT SURE WE SPEND ENOUGH TIME THINKING ABOUT WHAT OUR FEARS MEAN
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G AS WE GROW UP WE 'RE OFTEN ENCOURAGED TO THINK OF FEAR AS A WEAKNESS JUST ANOTHER CHILDISH THING TO DISCARD LIKE BABY TEETH OR ROLLER SKATES
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G AND I THINK IT 'S NO ACCIDENT THAT WE THINK THIS WAY NEUROSCIENTISTS HAVE ACTUALLY SHOWN THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE HARD WIRED TO BE OPTIMISTS
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G SO MAYBE THAT 'S WHY WE THINK OF FEAR SOMETIMES AS A DANGER IN AND OF ITSELF DON 'T WORRY WE LIKE TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER DON 'T PANIC IN ENGLISH FEAR IS SOMETHING WE CONQUER IT 'S SOMETHING WE FIGHT IT 'S SOMETHING WE OVERCOME BUT WHAT IF WE LOOKED AT FEAR IN A FRESH WAY
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G WHAT IF WE THOUGHT OF FEAR AS AN AMAZING ACT OF THE IMAGINATION SOMETHING THAT CAN BE AS PROFOUND AND INSIGHTFUL AS STORYTELLING ITSELF
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G IT 'S EASIEST TO SEE THIS LINK BETWEEN FEAR AND THE IMAGINATION IN YOUNG CHILDREN WHOSE FEARS ARE OFTEN EXTRAORDINARILY VIVID
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G WHEN I WAS A CHILD I LIVED IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS YOU KNOW MOSTLY A VERY NICE PLACE TO LIVE
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT MOST OF US LEARN TO LEAVE THESE KINDS OF VISIONS BEHIND AND GROW UP WE LEARN THAT THERE ARE NO MONSTERS HIDING UNDER THE BED AND NOT EVERY EARTHQUAKE BRINGS BUILDINGS DOWN
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G BUT MAYBE IT 'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT SOME OF OUR MOST CREATIVE MINDS FAIL TO LEAVE THESE KINDS OF FEARS BEHIND AS ADULTS THE SAME INCREDIBLE IMAGINATIONS THAT PRODUCED THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES JANE EYRE AND THE REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST ALSO GENERATED INTENSE WORRIES THAT HAUNTED THE ADULT LIVES OF CHARLES DARWIN CHARLOTTE BRONTĂŤ
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G AND MARCEL PROUST SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT CAN THE REST OF US LEARN
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G LET 'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE FEARS THAT THEIR IMAGINATIONS WERE GENERATING AS THEY DRIFTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC TWENTY FOUR HOURS HAD NOW PASSED SINCE THE CAPSIZING OF THE SHIP THE TIME HAD COME FOR THE MEN TO MAKE A PLAN BUT THEY HAD VERY FEW OPTIONS
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G IN HIS FASCINATING ACCOUNT OF THE DISASTER NATHANIEL PHILBRICK WROTE THAT THESE MEN WERE JUST ABOUT AS FAR FROM LAND AS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO BE ANYWHERE ON EARTH
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G NOW THE LAST OPTION WAS THE LONGEST AND THE MOST DIFFICULT TO SAIL ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MILES DUE SOUTH IN HOPES OF REACHING A CERTAIN BAND OF WINDS THAT COULD EVENTUALLY PUSH THEM TOWARD THE COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA BUT THEY KNEW THAT THE SHEER LENGTH OF THIS JOURNEY WOULD STRETCH THEIR SUPPLIES OF FOOD AND WATER
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G TO BE EATEN BY CANNIBALS TO BE BATTERED BY STORMS TO STARVE TO DEATH BEFORE REACHING LAND THESE WERE THE FEARS THAT DANCED IN THE IMAGINATIONS OF THESE POOR MEN AND AS IT TURNED OUT THE FEAR THEY CHOSE TO LISTEN TO WOULD GOVERN WHETHER THEY LIVED OR DIED
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G NOW WE MIGHT JUST AS EASILY CALL THESE FEARS BY A DIFFERENT NAME WHAT IF INSTEAD OF CALLING THEM FEARS WE CALLED THEM STORIES BECAUSE THAT 'S REALLY WHAT FEAR IS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT 'S A KIND OF UNINTENTIONAL STORYTELLING THAT WE ARE ALL BORN KNOWING HOW TO DO
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G AND FEARS AND STORYTELLING HAVE THE SAME COMPONENTS THEY HAVE THE SAME ARCHITECTURE LIKE ALL STORIES FEARS HAVE CHARACTERS IN OUR FEARS THE CHARACTERS ARE US FEARS ALSO HAVE PLOTS THEY HAVE BEGINNINGS AND MIDDLES AND ENDS YOU BOARD THE PLANE THE PLANE TAKES OFF THE ENGINE FAILS
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G OUR FEARS ALSO TEND TO CONTAIN IMAGERY THAT CAN BE EVERY BIT AS VIVID AS WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND IN THE PAGES OF A NOVEL PICTURE A CANNIBAL
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G HUMAN TEETH SINKING INTO HUMAN SKIN HUMAN FLESH ROASTING OVER A FIRE
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G FEARS ALSO HAVE SUSPENSE
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G IF I 'VE DONE MY JOB AS A STORYTELLER TODAY YOU SHOULD BE WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MEN OF THE WHALESHIP ESSEX OUR FEARS PROVOKE IN US A VERY SIMILAR FORM OF SUSPENSE JUST LIKE ALL GREAT STORIES OUR FEARS FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON A QUESTION THAT IS AS IMPORTANT IN LIFE AS IT IS IN LITERATURE WHAT WILL HAPPEN
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G NEXT IN OTHER WORDS OUR FEARS MAKE US THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE AND HUMANS BY THE WAY ARE THE ONLY CREATURES CAPABLE OF THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE IN THIS WAY OF PROJECTING OURSELVES FORWARD IN TIME AND THIS MENTAL TIME TRAVEL IS JUST ONE MORE THING THAT FEARS HAVE IN COMMON WITH STORYTELLING
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G AS A WRITER I CAN TELL YOU THAT A BIG PART OF WRITING FICTION IS LEARNING TO PREDICT HOW ONE EVENT IN A STORY WILL AFFECT ALL THE OTHER EVENTS AND FEAR WORKS IN THAT SAME WAY IN FEAR JUST LIKE IN FICTION ONE THING ALWAYS LEADS TO ANOTHER
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G WHEN I WAS WRITING MY FIRST NOVEL THE AGE OF MIRACLES I SPENT MONTHS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH SUDDENLY BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO OUR DAYS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO OUR CROPS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO OUR MINDS
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO OUR HOUSE WHAT WILL HAPPEN
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G TO MY FAMILY AND THE ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS ALWAYS TOOK THE FORM OF A STORY
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G SO IF WE THINK OF OUR FEARS AS MORE THAN JUST FEARS BUT AS STORIES WE SHOULD THINK OF OURSELVES AS THE AUTHORS OF THOSE STORIES BUT JUST AS IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO THINK OF OURSELVES AS THE READERS OF OUR FEARS AND HOW WE CHOOSE TO READ OUR FEARS CAN HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON OUR LIVES
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G NOW SOME OF US NATURALLY READ OUR FEARS MORE CLOSELY THAN OTHERS I READ ABOUT A STUDY RECENTLY OF SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEURS
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G AND THE AUTHOR FOUND THAT THESE PEOPLE SHARED A HABIT THAT HE CALLED PRODUCTIVE PARANOIA WHICH MEANT THAT THESE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF DISMISSING THEIR FEARS THESE PEOPLE READ THEM CLOSELY THEY STUDIED THEM AND THEN THEY TRANSLATED THAT FEAR INTO PREPARATION AND ACTION
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G SO THAT WAY IF THEIR WORST FEARS CAME TRUE THEIR BUSINESSES WERE READY AND SOMETIMES OF COURSE OUR WORST FEARS DO COME TRUE
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G THAT 'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS SO EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT FEAR ONCE IN A WHILE
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G OUR FEARS CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G BUT WE CAN 'T POSSIBLY PREPARE FOR ALL OF THE FEARS THAT OUR IMAGINATIONS CONCOCT SO HOW CAN WE TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FEARS WORTH LISTENING TO AND ALL THE OTHERS I THINK THE END OF THE STORY OF THE WHALESHIP ESSEX OFFERS AN ILLUMINATING IF TRAGIC EXAMPLE
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G AFTER MUCH DELIBERATION THE MEN FINALLY MADE A DECISION TERRIFIED OF CANNIBALS THEY DECIDED TO FORGO THE CLOSEST ISLANDS AND INSTEAD EMBARKED ON THE LONGER AND MUCH MORE DIFFICULT ROUTE TO SOUTH
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G WHEN THE LAST OF THE SURVIVORS WERE FINALLY PICKED UP BY TWO PASSING SHIPS LESS THAN HALF OF THE MEN WERE LEFT ALIVE AND SOME OF THEM HAD RESORTED TO THEIR OWN FORM OF CANNIBALISM
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G HERMAN MELVILLE WHO USED THIS STORY AS RESEARCH FOR MOBY DICK WROTE YEARS LATER AND FROM DRY LAND QUOTE ALL THE SUFFERINGS OF THESE MISERABLE MEN OF THE ESSEX MIGHT IN ALL HUMAN PROBABILITY HAVE BEEN AVOIDED HAD THEY IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEAVING
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G STEERED STRAIGHT FOR TAHITI BUT AS MELVILLE PUT IT THEY DREADED CANNIBALS
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G LOOKED AT FROM THIS ANGLE THEIRS BECOMES A STORY ABOUT READING THE NOVELIST VLADIMIR NABOKOV SAID THAT THE BEST READER HAS A COMBINATION OF TWO VERY DIFFERENT TEMPERAMENTS THE ARTISTIC AND
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G WHICH ACTS TO TEMPER AND COMPLICATE THE READER 'S INTUITIVE REACTIONS TO THE STORY
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G AS WE 'VE SEEN THE MEN OF THE ESSEX HAD NO TROUBLE WITH THE ARTISTIC PART THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THEY LISTENED TO THE WRONG STORY
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G OF ALL THE NARRATIVES THEIR FEARS WROTE THEY RESPONDED ONLY TO THE MOST LURID THE MOST VIVID THE ONE THAT WAS EASIEST FOR THEIR IMAGINATIONS TO PICTURE CANNIBALS
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G THE GRADUAL CHANGES IN OUR CLIMATE JUST AS THE MOST NUANCED STORIES IN LITERATURE ARE OFTEN THE RICHEST SO TOO MIGHT OUR SUBTLEST FEARS BE THE TRUEST
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G PROPERLY READ OUR FEARS CAN OFFER US SOMETHING AS PRECIOUS AS OUR FAVORITE WORKS OF LITERATURE A LITTLE WISDOM A BIT OF INSIGHT AND A VERSION OF THAT MOST ELUSIVE THING
