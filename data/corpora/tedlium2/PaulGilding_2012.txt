PaulGilding_2012@22.98:26.13 THIS CENTURY
PaulGilding_2012@41.82:46.99 SO MUCH THAT OUR ECONOMY IS NOW BIGGER THAN ITS HOST OUR PLANET
PaulGilding_2012@65.2:81.35 THE EMINENT SCIENTISTS OF THE GLOBAL FOOTPRINT NETWORK FOR EXAMPLE CALCULATE THAT WE NEED ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE EARTHS TO SUSTAIN THIS ECONOMY IN OTHER WORDS TO KEEP OPERATING AT OUR CURRENT LEVEL WE NEED FIFTY PERCENT MORE EARTH THAN WE 'VE GOT
PaulGilding_2012@84.46:91.5 IN FINANCIAL TERMS THIS WOULD BE LIKE ALWAYS SPENDING FIFTY PERCENT MORE THAN YOU EARN GOING FURTHER INTO DEBT EVERY YEAR
PaulGilding_2012@91.87:97.48 BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN 'T BORROW NATURAL RESOURCES SO WE 'RE BURNING THROUGH OUR CAPITAL
PaulGilding_2012@97.56:99.59 OR STEALING FROM THE FUTURE
PaulGilding_2012@100.6:109.05 SO WHEN I SAY FULL I MEAN REALLY FULL WELL PAST ANY MARGIN FOR ERROR WELL PAST ANY DISPUTE ABOUT METHODOLOGY
PaulGilding_2012@111.59:116.89 WHAT THIS MEANS IS OUR ECONOMY IS UNSUSTAINABLE I 'M NOT SAYING IT 'S NOT NICE OR PLEASANT
PaulGilding_2012@121.74:126.93 WHAT I 'M SAYING IS OUR APPROACH IS SIMPLY UNSUSTAINABLE IN OTHER WORDS
PaulGilding_2012@135.13:145.63 ECONOMIC GROWTH BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT WILL STOP ECONOMIC GROWTH IT WILL STOP BECAUSE OF THE END OF TRADE RESOURCES IT WILL STOP BECAUSE OF THE GROWING DEMAND
PaulGilding_2012@156.51:165.16 WHEN WE THINK ABOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH STOPPING WE GO THAT 'S NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE ECONOMIC GROWTH IS SO ESSENTIAL TO OUR SOCIETY THAT IS IS RARELY QUESTIONED
PaulGilding_2012@173.61:186.15 UNDERSTAND THE POSSIBILITY OF IT NOT BEING AROUND EVEN THOUGH IT HAS DELIVERED MANY BENEFITS IT IS BASED ON A CRAZY IDEA THE CRAZY IDEA BEING THAT WE CAN HAVE INFINITE GROWTH ON A FINITE PLANET
PaulGilding_2012@187.17:195.91 AND I 'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES THAT THE CRAZY IDEA IS JUST THAT IT IS CRAZY AND WITH THE EARTH FULL IT 'S GAME OVER
PaulGilding_2012@225.58:228.66 THE PROBLEM IS WE 'RE JUST WARMING UP THIS GROWTH ENGINE
PaulGilding_2012@229.53:232.37 WE PLAN TO TAKE THIS HIGHLY STRESSED ECONOMY
PaulGilding_2012@245.92:249.26 CHINA PLANS TO BE THERE IN JUST TWENTY YEARS
PaulGilding_2012@250.43:254.5 THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS PLAN IS THAT IT 'S NOT POSSIBLE
PaulGilding_2012@293.73:306.98 SO THE IDEA THAT WE CAN SMOOTHLY TRANSITION TO A HIGHLY EFFICIENT SOLAR POWERED KNOWLEDGE BASED ECONOMY TRANSFORMED BY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SO THAT NINE BILLION PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTY
PaulGilding_2012@307.6:311.42 A LIFE OF ABUNDANCE AND DIGITAL DOWNLOADS IS A DELUSION
PaulGilding_2012@312.94:318.2 IT 'S NOT THAT IT 'S NOT POSSIBLE TO FEED CLOTHE AND HOUSE US ALL AND HAVE US LIVE DECENT LIVES
PaulGilding_2012@318.79:326.47 IT CERTAINLY IS BUT THE IDEA THAT WE CAN GENTLY GROW THERE WITH A FEW MINOR HICCUPS IS JUST WRONG
PaulGilding_2012@332.69:336.9 SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU OPERATE A SYSTEM PAST ITS LIMITS
PaulGilding_2012@342.37:345.55 IS THAT THE SYSTEM STOPS WORKING AND BREAKS DOWN
PaulGilding_2012@346.48:348.76 AND THAT 'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO US
PaulGilding_2012@353.62:355.38 MANY OF YOU WILL BE THINKING
PaulGilding_2012@356.1:360.21 BUT SURELY WE CAN STILL STOP THIS IF IT 'S THAT BAD WE 'LL REACT
PaulGilding_2012@360.87:366.41 LET 'S JUST THINK THROUGH THAT IDEA NOW WE 'VE HAD FIFTY YEARS OF WARNINGS
PaulGilding_2012@380.13:385.28 PRETTY MUCH NOTHING TO CHANGE COURSE WE 'RE NOT EVEN SLOWING DOWN
PaulGilding_2012@385.52:389.75 LAST YEAR ON CLIMATE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD THE HIGHEST GLOBAL EMISSIONS EVER
PaulGilding_2012@409.51:411.06 AND RECOGNIZED
PaulGilding_2012@419.07:424.36 AND THAT 'S WHY THE END OF GROWTH IS THE CENTRAL ISSUE AND THE EVENT THAT WE NEED TO GET READY FOR
PaulGilding_2012@424.72:430.78 SO WHEN DOES THIS TRANSITION BEGIN WHEN DOES THIS BREAKDOWN BEGIN
PaulGilding_2012@459.62:465.42 IN FACT IT 'S THE SYSTEM IN THE PAINFUL PROCESS OF BREAKING DOWN OUR SYSTEM
PaulGilding_2012@476.97:485.31 I COULD GIVE YOU COUNTLESS STUDIES AND EVIDENCE TO PROVE THIS BUT I WON 'T BECAUSE IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT THAT EVIDENCE IS ALL AROUND YOU
PaulGilding_2012@485.89:488.19 I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT FEAR
PaulGilding_2012@489.12:495.68 I WANT TO DO SO BECAUSE IN MY VIEW THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE WE FACE
PaulGilding_2012@496.65:500.13 IS HOW WE RESPOND TO THIS QUESTION
PaulGilding_2012@500.38:503.62 THE CRISIS IS NOW INEVITABLE
PaulGilding_2012@508.32:510.39 OF COURSE WE CAN 'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN
PaulGilding_2012@510.64:515.47 THE FUTURE IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN BUT LET 'S JUST THINK THROUGH WHAT THE SCIENCE IS TELLING US
PaulGilding_2012@515.58:520.11 IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IMAGINE OUR ECONOMY
PaulGilding_2012@521.34:529.51 WHEN THE CARBON BUBBLE BURSTS WHEN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS RECOGNIZE THAT TO HAVE ANY HOPE OF PREVENTING THE CLIMATE SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL
PaulGilding_2012@530.27:533.22 THE OIL AND COAL INDUSTRIES ARE FINISHED
PaulGilding_2012@534.45:539.29 IMAGINE CHINA INDIA AND PAKISTAN GOING TO WAR AS CLIMATE IMPACTS
PaulGilding_2012@540.33:542.55 GENERATE CONFLICT OVER FOOD AND WATER
PaulGilding_2012@543.75:546.16 IMAGINE THE MIDDLE EAST WITHOUT OIL INCOME
PaulGilding_2012@546.47:548.25 BUT WITH COLLAPSING GOVERNMENTS
PaulGilding_2012@549.03:555.4 IMAGINE OUR HIGHLY TUNED JUST IN TIME FOOD INDUSTRY AND OUR HIGHLY STRESSED AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM FAILING
PaulGilding_2012@559.98:570.15 IMAGINE THIRTY PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT IN AMERICA AS THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IS GRIPPED BY FEAR AND UNCERTAINTY NOW IMAGINE WHAT THAT MEANS FOR YOU YOUR FAMILY
PaulGilding_2012@570.62:577.5 YOUR FRIENDS YOUR PERSONAL FINANCIAL SECURITY IMAGINE WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOUR PERSONAL SECURITY
PaulGilding_2012@578.13:584.56 AS A HEAVILY ARMED CIVILIAN POPULATION GETS ANGRIER AND ANGRIER ABOUT WHY THIS WAS ALLOWED TO HAPPEN
PaulGilding_2012@586.39:592.98 IMAGINE WHAT YOU 'LL TELL YOUR CHILDREN WHEN THEY ASK YOU SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE MOM AND DAD WHAT WAS IT LIKE
PaulGilding_2012@618.23:619.74 WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
PaulGilding_2012@622.11:623.65 SO HOW DO YOU FEEL
PaulGilding_2012@672.91:674.62 WE SHOULD FEEL A BIT OF FEAR
PaulGilding_2012@677.05:679.64 WE ARE IN DANGER ALL OF US
PaulGilding_2012@679.92:685.4 AND WE 'VE EVOLVED TO RESPOND TO DANGER WITH FEAR TO MOTIVATE A POWERFUL RESPONSE
PaulGilding_2012@689.3:692.86 BUT THIS TIME IT 'S NOT A TIGER AT THE CAVE MOUTH
PaulGilding_2012@693.24:696.77 YOU CAN 'T SEE THE DANGER AT YOUR DOOR BUT IF YOU LOOK
PaulGilding_2012@696.89:699.6 YOU CAN SEE IT AT THE DOOR OF YOUR CIVILIZATION
PaulGilding_2012@702.08:715.32 THAT 'S WHY WE NEED TO FEEL OUR RESPONSE NOW WHILE THE LIGHTS ARE STILL ON BECAUSE IF WE WAIT UNTIL THE CRISIS TAKES HOLD WE MAY PANIC AND HIDE IF WE FEEL IT NOW AND THINK IT THROUGH WE WILL REALIZE WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR BUT FEAR ITSELF
PaulGilding_2012@718.88:720.64 YES THINGS WILL GET UGLY
PaulGilding_2012@720.79:733.12 AND IT WILL HAPPEN SOON CERTAINLY IN OUR LIFETIME BUT WE ARE MORE THAN CAPABLE OF GETTING THROUGH EVERYTHING THAT 'S COMING YOU SEE THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE FAITH THAT HUMANS CAN SOLVE ANY PROBLEM
PaulGilding_2012@734.35:736.3 THAT TECHNOLOGY IS LIMITLESS
PaulGilding_2012@742.22:744.45 IS THAT IT TAKES A GOOD CRISIS TO GET US GOING
PaulGilding_2012@745.28:751.65 WHEN WE FEEL FEAR AND WE FEAR LOSS WE ARE CAPABLE OF QUITE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS THINK ABOUT
PaulGilding_2012@771.14:780.2 THINK ABOUT HOW AN INDIVIDUAL RESPONDS TO A DIAGNOSIS OF A LIFE THREATENING ILLNESS AND HOW LIFESTYLE CHANGES THAT PREVIOUSLY WERE JUST TOO DIFFICULT
PaulGilding_2012@784.86:789.35 WE ARE SMART IN FACT WE REALLY ARE QUITE AMAZING BUT WE DO LOVE A GOOD CRISIS
PaulGilding_2012@789.46:791.9 AND THE GOOD NEWS THIS ONE 'S A MONSTER
PaulGilding_2012@798.01:807.66 BUT IF WE GET IT RIGHT IT COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF CIVILIZATION INSTEAD AND HOW COOL WOULD IT BE TO TELL YOUR GRANDCHILDREN THAT YOU WERE PART OF THAT
PaulGilding_2012@820.09:821.76 IN JUST A FEW DECADES
PaulGilding_2012@832.37:836.13 SO NAMED BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL OF MOBILIZATION AND FOCUS REQUIRED
PaulGilding_2012@836.92:848.78 TO MY SURPRISE ELIMINATING NET CO TWO EMISSIONS FROM THE ECONOMY IN JUST TWENTY YEARS IS ACTUALLY PRETTY EASY AND PRETTY CHEAP NOT VERY CHEAP BUT CERTAINLY LESS THAN THE COST OF A COLLAPSING CIVILIZATION
PaulGilding_2012@854.94:869.55 YOU CAN READ THE DETAILS BUT IN SUMMARY WE CAN TRANSFORM OUR ECONOMY WE CAN DO IT WITH PROVEN TECHNOLOGY WE CAN DO IT AT AN AFFORDABLE COST WE CAN DO IT WITH EXISTING POLITICAL STRUCTURES THE ONLY THING WE NEED TO CHANGE IS HOW WE THINK AND HOW WE FEEL
PaulGilding_2012@869.69:871.43 AND THIS IS WHERE YOU COME IN
PaulGilding_2012@872.74:876.45 WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE I PAINT OF COURSE WE SHOULD FEEL A BIT OF FEAR
PaulGilding_2012@877.15:882.3 BUT FEAR CAN BE PARALYZING OR MOTIVATING WE NEED TO ACCEPT THE FEAR AND THEN WE NEED TO ACT
PaulGilding_2012@891.79:900.71 WE CAN DO THIS I KNOW THE FREE MARKET FUNDAMENTALISTS WILL TELL YOU THAT MORE GROWTH MORE STUFF AND NINE BILLION PEOPLE GOING SHOPPING IS THE BEST WE CAN DO
PaulGilding_2012@900.71:902.31 THEY 'RE WRONG
PaulGilding_2012@902.8:905.35 WE CAN BE MORE WE CAN BE MUCH MORE
PaulGilding_2012@907.29:914.51 WE HAVE ACHIEVED REMARKABLE THINGS SINCE WORKING OUT HOW TO GROW FOOD SOME TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO WE 'VE BUILT A POWERFUL FOUNDATION
PaulGilding_2012@914.58:917.54 OF SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGY MORE THAN ENOUGH
PaulGilding_2012@928.73:933.77 WE CAN CHOOSE THIS MOMENT OF CRISIS TO ASK AND ANSWER THE BIG QUESTIONS OF SOCIETY 'S EVOLUTION
PaulGilding_2012@944.66:946.51 WELL IT 'S TIME TO GROW UP
PaulGilding_2012@962.67:966.92 WHICH IS STRONGER AND HAPPIER AND PLANS ON STAYING AROUND
