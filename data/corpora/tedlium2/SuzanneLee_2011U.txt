SuzanneLee_2011U@16.24:20.53 AS A FASHION DESIGNER I 'VE ALWAYS TENDED TO THINK OF MATERIALS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
SuzanneLee_2011U@20.54:26.15 OR THIS OR MAYBE THIS
SuzanneLee_2011U@28.3:33.28 BUT THEN I MET A BIOLOGIST AND NOW I THINK OF MATERIALS LIKE THIS
SuzanneLee_2011U@33.48:38.2 GREEN TEA SUGAR A FEW MICROBES AND A LITTLE TIME
SuzanneLee_2011U@38.2:57.89 I 'M ESSENTIALLY USING A KOMBUCHA RECIPE WHICH IS A SYMBIOTIC MIX OF BACTERIA YEASTS AND OTHER MICRO ORGANISMS WHICH SPIN CELLULOSE IN A FERMENTATION PROCESS OVER TIME THESE TINY THREADS FORM IN THE LIQUID INTO LAYERS AND PRODUCE A MAT ON THE SURFACE
SuzanneLee_2011U@58.04:64.65 SO WE START BY BREWING THE TEA I BREW UP TO ABOUT THIRTY LITERS OF TEA AT A TIME
SuzanneLee_2011U@64.66:72.57 AND THEN WHILE IT 'S STILL HOT ADD A COUPLE OF KILOS OF SUGAR WE STIR THIS IN UNTIL IT 'S COMPLETELY DISSOLVED AND THEN POUR IT INTO A GROWTH BATH
SuzanneLee_2011U@72.74:80.45 WE NEED TO CHECK THAT THE TEMPERATURE HAS COOLED TO BELOW THIRTY DEGREES C AND THEN WE 'RE READY TO ADD THE LIVING ORGANISM AND ALONG WITH THAT
SuzanneLee_2011U@80.51:91.39 SOME ACETIC ACID AND ONCE YOU GET THIS PROCESS GOING YOU CAN ACTUALLY RECYCLE YOUR PREVIOUS FERMENTED LIQUID WE NEED TO MAINTAIN AN OPTIMUM TEMPERATURE FOR THE GROWTH
SuzanneLee_2011U@91.72:109.32 AND I USE A HEAT MAT TO SIT THE BATH ON AND A THERMOSTAT TO REGULATE IT AND ACTUALLY IN HOT WEATHER I CAN JUST GROW IT OUTSIDE SO THIS IS MY MINI FABRIC FARM AFTER ABOUT THREE DAYS THE BUBBLES WILL APPEAR ON THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUID SO THIS IS TELLING US THAT THE FERMENTATION IS IN FULL SWING
SuzanneLee_2011U@109.47:127.06 AND THE BACTERIA ARE FEEDING ON THE SUGAR NUTRIENTS IN THE LIQUID SO THEY 'RE SPINNING THESE TINY NANO FIBERS OF PURE CELLULOSE AND THEY 'RE STICKING TOGETHER FORMING LAYERS AND GIVING US A SHEET ON THE SURFACE AFTER ABOUT TWO TO THREE WEEKS WE 'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING WHICH IS ABOUT AN INCH IN THICKNESS
SuzanneLee_2011U@127.06:131.56 SO THE BATH ON THE LEFT IS AFTER FIVE DAYS AND ON THE RIGHT AFTER TEN
SuzanneLee_2011U@131.76:138.82 AND THIS IS A STATIC CULTURE YOU DON 'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING TO IT YOU JUST LITERALLY WATCH IT GROW IT DOESN 'T NEED LIGHT
SuzanneLee_2011U@152.91:155.78 AGAIN YOU CAN DO THAT OUTSIDE AND JUST LET IT DRY
SuzanneLee_2011U@168.62:181.93 AND THEN YOU CAN EITHER CUT THAT OUT AND SEW IT CONVENTIONALLY OR YOU CAN USE THE WET MATERIAL TO FORM IT AROUND A THREE DIMENSIONAL SHAPE AND AS IT EVAPORATES IT WILL KNIT ITSELF TOGETHER FORMING SEAMS
SuzanneLee_2011U@181.93:189.11 SO THE COLOR IN THIS JACKET IS COMING PURELY FROM GREEN TEA I GUESS IT ALSO LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE HUMAN SKIN WHICH INTRIGUES ME
SuzanneLee_2011U@189.11:203.99 SINCE IT 'S ORGANIC I 'M REALLY KEEN TO TRY AND MINIMIZE THE ADDITION OF ANY CHEMICALS I CAN MAKE IT CHANGE COLOR WITHOUT USING DYE BY A PROCESS OF IRON OXIDATION USING FRUIT AND VEGETABLE STAINING CREATE ORGANIC PATTERNING
SuzanneLee_2011U@203.99:211.59 AND USING INDIGO MAKE IT ANTI MICROBIAL AND IN FACT COTTON WOULD TAKE UP TO EIGHTEEN
SuzanneLee_2011U@226.21:233.04 IN THE RAIN WEARING THIS DRESS TODAY I WOULD IMMEDIATELY START TO ABSORB HUGE AMOUNTS OF WATER
SuzanneLee_2011U@233.52:244.34 THE DRESS WOULD GET REALLY HEAVY AND EVENTUALLY THE SEAMS WOULD PROBABLY FALL APART LEAVING ME FEELING RATHER NAKED POSSIBLY A GOOD PERFORMANCE PIECE BUT DEFINITELY NOT IDEAL FOR EVERYDAY WEAR
SuzanneLee_2011U@265.21:277.28 BACTERIAL CELLULOSE IS ACTUALLY ALREADY BEING USED FOR WOUND HEALING AND POSSIBLY IN THE FUTURE FOR BIOCOMPATIBLE BLOOD VESSELS POSSIBLY EVEN REPLACEMENT BONE TISSUE
SuzanneLee_2011U@277.28:282.71 BUT WITH SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY WE CAN ACTUALLY IMAGINE ENGINEERING THIS BACTERIUM
SuzanneLee_2011U@282.71:299.59 TO PRODUCE SOMETHING THAT GIVES US THE QUALITY QUANTITY AND SHAPE OF MATERIAL THAT WE DESIRE OBVIOUSLY AS A DESIGNER THAT 'S REALLY EXCITING BECAUSE THEN I START TO THINK WOW WE COULD ACTUALLY IMAGINE GROWING CONSUMABLE PRODUCTS
SuzanneLee_2011U@302.12:319.3 WHAT EXCITES ME ABOUT USING MICROBES IS THEIR EFFICIENCY SO WE ONLY GROW WHAT WE NEED THERE 'S NO WASTE AND IN FACT WE COULD MAKE IT FROM A WASTE STREAM SO FOR EXAMPLE A WASTE SUGAR STREAM FROM A FOOD PROCESSING PLANT
SuzanneLee_2011U@319.3:324.58 FINALLY AT THE END OF USE WE COULD BIODEGRADE IT NATURALLY ALONG WITH YOUR VEGETABLE PEELINGS
SuzanneLee_2011U@334.32:349.61 I DO THINK IT COULD BE QUITE A SMART AND SUSTAINABLE ADDITION TO OUR INCREASINGLY PRECIOUS NATURAL RESOURCES ULTIMATELY MAYBE IT WON 'T EVEN BE FASHION WHERE WE SEE THESE MICROBES HAVE THEIR IMPACT WE COULD FOR EXAMPLE IMAGINE GROWING A LAMP A CHAIR
