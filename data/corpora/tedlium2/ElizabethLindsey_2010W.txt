ElizabethLindsey_2010W@18.05:20.96 I WAS RAISED BY NATIVE HAWAIIAN ELDERS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@21.27:25.77 THREE OLD WOMEN WHO TOOK CARE OF ME WHILE MY PARENTS WORKED
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@27.59:29.79 THE YEAR IS ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@38.67:48.42 AND THE SHIFTING OF THE TIDES IT 'S A STRETCH OF BEACH WE KNOW SO WELL THE SMOOTH STONES ON THE SAND
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@52.51:54.93 IF YOU SAW THESE WOMEN ON THE STREET
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@55.02:60.01 IN THEIR FADED CLOTHES YOU MIGHT DISMISS THEM AS POOR AND SIMPLE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@60.51:62.14 THAT WOULD BE A MISTAKE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@63.64:67.19 THESE WOMEN ARE DESCENDANTS OF POLYNESIAN NAVIGATORS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@67.46:70.23 TRAINED IN THE OLD WAYS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@70.59:72.24 BY THEIR ELDERS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@72.34:74.58 AND NOW THEY 'RE PASSING IT ON TO ME
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@75.14:83.15 THEY TEACH ME THE NAMES OF THE WINDS AND THE RAINS OF ASTRONOMY ACCORDING TO A GENEALOGY OF STARS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@83.86:89.24 THERE 'S A NEW MOON ON THE HORIZON HAWAIIANS SAY IT 'S A GOOD NIGHT FOR FISHING
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@90.03:91.75 THEY BEGIN TO CHANT
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@124.66:126.32 THEY SIT IN A CIRCLE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@126.43:128.4 AND ASK ME TO COME TO JOIN THEM
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@129.77:132.22 THEY WANT TO TEACH ME ABOUT MY DESTINY
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@133.33:135.89 I THOUGHT EVERY SEVEN YEAR OLD WENT THROUGH
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@144.7:146.69 PEOPLE WILL FORGET THEIR WISDOM
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@147.81:153.08 IT WILL TAKE ELDERS VOICES FROM THE FAR CORNERS OF THE WORLD
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@153.45:155.72 TO CALL THE WORLD INTO BALANCE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@157.33:159.39 YOU WILL GO FAR AWAY
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@160:163.85 IT WILL SOMETIMES BE A LONELY ROAD WE WILL NOT BE THERE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@164.43:168.94 BUT YOU WILL LOOK INTO THE EYES OF SEEMING STRANGERS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@192.38:194.55 THE YEAR IS TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@195.31:198.49 I 'M ON A REMOTE ISLAND IN MICRONESIA
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@202.04:203.78 BY ONE MILE WIDE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@212.59:216.37 HE 'S ALSO CONSIDERED THE GREATEST WAVE FINDER IN THE WORLD
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@217.76:221.59 THERE ARE FEWER THAN A HANDFUL OF PALU LEFT ON THIS ISLAND
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@222.55:224.97 THEIR TRADITION IS SO EXTRAORDINARY
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@225.38:227.42 THAT THESE MARINERS SAILED
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@227.52:232.78 THREE MILLION SQUARE MILES ACROSS THE PACIFIC WITHOUT THE USE OF INSTRUMENTS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@233.37:242.58 THEY COULD SYNTHESIZE PATTERNS IN NATURE USING THE RISING AND SETTING OF STARS THE SEQUENCE AND DIRECTION OF WAVES
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@242.75:255.59 THE FLIGHT PATTERNS OF CERTAIN BIRDS EVEN THE SLIGHTEST HINT OF COLOR ON THE UNDERBELLY OF A CLOUD WOULD INFORM THEM AND HELP THEM NAVIGATE WITH THE KEENEST ACCURACY
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@258.28:267.42 WHEN WESTERN SCIENTISTS WOULD JOIN MAU ON THE CANOE AND WATCH HIM GO INTO THE HULL IT APPEARED THAT AN OLD MAN WAS GOING TO REST
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@267.57:279.12 IN FACT THE HULL OF THE CANOE IS THE WOMB OF THE VESSEL IT IS THE MOST ACCURATE PLACE TO FEEL THE RHYTHM AND SEQUENCE AND DIRECTION OF WAVES
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@286.81:290.6 IT 'S WHAT HE HAD BEEN TRAINED TO DO SINCE HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@291.57:294.7 NOW SCIENCE MAY DISMISS THIS METHODOLOGY
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@296.2:299.11 BUT POLYNESIAN NAVIGATORS USE IT TODAY
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@299.32:301.84 BECAUSE IT PROVIDES THEM
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@302.64:307.67 AN ACCURATE DETERMINATION OF THE ANGLE AND DIRECTION OF THEIR VESSEL
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@308.63:324.89 THE PALU ALSO HAD AN UNCANNY ABILITY TO FORECAST WEATHER CONDITIONS DAYS IN ADVANCE SOMETIMES I 'D BE WITH MAU ON A CLOUD COVERED NIGHT AND WE 'D SIT AT THE EASTERNMOST COAST OF THE ISLAND AND HE WOULD LOOK OUT
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@335.81:347.56 THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS INTELLECTUALLY AND SCIENTIFICALLY ARE EXTRAORDINARY AND THEY ARE SO RELEVANT FOR THESE TIMES THAT WE ARE IN WHEN WE ARE RIDING OUT STORMS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@348.02:353.27 WE ARE IN SUCH A CRITICAL MOMENT OF OUR COLLECTIVE HISTORY
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@356.05:360.75 THEY HAVE BEEN COMPARED TO ASTRONAUTS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@360.98:368.3 THESE ELDER NAVIGATORS WHO SAIL VAST OPEN OCEANS IN DOUBLE HULLED CANOES
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@368.32:371.84 THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM A SMALL ISLAND
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@372.85:374.5 THEIR CANOES
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@394.65:397.62 WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE IT
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@398.79:400.79 THE YEAR IS TWO THOUSAND AND TEN
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@402.58:405.6 JUST AS THE WOMEN IN HAWAII
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@405.81:409.53 THAT RAISED ME PREDICTED THE WORLD IS IN TROUBLE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@411.99:416.33 WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY BLOATED WITH DATA
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@416.82:419.11 YET STARVED FOR WISDOM
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@419.98:422.3 WE 'RE CONNECTED TWENTY FOUR SEVEN
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@426.78:433.76 FEAR DEPRESSION AND LONELINESS IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH WE MUST COURSE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@438.45:440.82 YOUR SOCIETY WORSHIPS THE JESTER
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@441.67:445.6 WHILE THE KING STANDS IN PLAIN CLOTHES
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@449.95:454.75 THE LINK BETWEEN THE PAST AND THE FUTURE IS FRAGILE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@455.9:461.9 THIS I KNOW INTIMATELY BECAUSE EVEN AS I TRAVEL THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@462.18:465.33 TO LISTEN TO THESE STORIES AND RECORD THEM
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@476.78:479.34 BY THE FACT THAT I NO LONGER
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@480.03:482.76 REMEMBER THE NAMES OF THE WINDS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@498.39:502.26 AND I AM REMINDED
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@502.48:510.69 THAT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THERE ARE CULTURES WITH VAST SUMS OF KNOWLEDGE IN THEM
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@512.06:515.17 AS POTENT AS THE MICRONESIAN NAVIGATORS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@516.02:520.91 THAT ARE GOING DISMISSED THAT THIS IS A TESTAMENT TO BRILLIANT
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@520.93:524.97 BRILLIANT TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE AND WISDOM
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@525.34:532.85 THAT IS VANISHING RAPIDLY BECAUSE WHEN AN ELDER DIES A LIBRARY IS BURNED AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD LIBRARIES ARE ABLAZE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@542.97:546.47 AND I REALIZE THROUGH A LESSON THAT HE SHARED
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@547.22:551.29 THAT WE CONTINUE TO FIND OUR WAY AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAID
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@551.78:554.61 THE ISLAND IS THE CANOE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@554.71:558.96 THE CANOE THE ISLAND AND WHAT HE MEANT WAS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@560.82:563.87 IF YOU ARE VOYAGING AND FAR FROM HOME
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@564.7:568.62 YOUR VERY SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON EVERYONE ABOARD
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@569.86:574.05 YOU CANNOT MAKE THE VOYAGE ALONE YOU WERE NEVER MEANT TO
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@574.05:580.8 THIS WHOLE NOTION OF EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF IS COMPLETELY UNSUSTAINABLE IT ALWAYS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@592.06:593.76 TRUE NAVIGATION
ElizabethLindsey_2010W@593.87:595.88 BEGINS IN THE HUMAN HEART
