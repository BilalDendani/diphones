ElizabethLindsey_2010W I WAS RAISED BY NATIVE HAWAIIAN ELDERS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THREE OLD WOMEN WHO TOOK CARE OF ME WHILE MY PARENTS WORKED
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THE YEAR IS ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W AND THE SHIFTING OF THE TIDES IT 'S A STRETCH OF BEACH WE KNOW SO WELL THE SMOOTH STONES ON THE SAND
ElizabethLindsey_2010W IF YOU SAW THESE WOMEN ON THE STREET
ElizabethLindsey_2010W IN THEIR FADED CLOTHES YOU MIGHT DISMISS THEM AS POOR AND SIMPLE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THAT WOULD BE A MISTAKE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THESE WOMEN ARE DESCENDANTS OF POLYNESIAN NAVIGATORS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W TRAINED IN THE OLD WAYS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W BY THEIR ELDERS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W AND NOW THEY 'RE PASSING IT ON TO ME
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THEY TEACH ME THE NAMES OF THE WINDS AND THE RAINS OF ASTRONOMY ACCORDING TO A GENEALOGY OF STARS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THERE 'S A NEW MOON ON THE HORIZON HAWAIIANS SAY IT 'S A GOOD NIGHT FOR FISHING
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THEY BEGIN TO CHANT
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THEY SIT IN A CIRCLE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W AND ASK ME TO COME TO JOIN THEM
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THEY WANT TO TEACH ME ABOUT MY DESTINY
ElizabethLindsey_2010W I THOUGHT EVERY SEVEN YEAR OLD WENT THROUGH
ElizabethLindsey_2010W PEOPLE WILL FORGET THEIR WISDOM
ElizabethLindsey_2010W IT WILL TAKE ELDERS VOICES FROM THE FAR CORNERS OF THE WORLD
ElizabethLindsey_2010W TO CALL THE WORLD INTO BALANCE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W YOU WILL GO FAR AWAY
ElizabethLindsey_2010W IT WILL SOMETIMES BE A LONELY ROAD WE WILL NOT BE THERE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W BUT YOU WILL LOOK INTO THE EYES OF SEEMING STRANGERS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THE YEAR IS TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
ElizabethLindsey_2010W I 'M ON A REMOTE ISLAND IN MICRONESIA
ElizabethLindsey_2010W BY ONE MILE WIDE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W HE 'S ALSO CONSIDERED THE GREATEST WAVE FINDER IN THE WORLD
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THERE ARE FEWER THAN A HANDFUL OF PALU LEFT ON THIS ISLAND
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THEIR TRADITION IS SO EXTRAORDINARY
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THAT THESE MARINERS SAILED
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THREE MILLION SQUARE MILES ACROSS THE PACIFIC WITHOUT THE USE OF INSTRUMENTS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THEY COULD SYNTHESIZE PATTERNS IN NATURE USING THE RISING AND SETTING OF STARS THE SEQUENCE AND DIRECTION OF WAVES
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THE FLIGHT PATTERNS OF CERTAIN BIRDS EVEN THE SLIGHTEST HINT OF COLOR ON THE UNDERBELLY OF A CLOUD WOULD INFORM THEM AND HELP THEM NAVIGATE WITH THE KEENEST ACCURACY
ElizabethLindsey_2010W WHEN WESTERN SCIENTISTS WOULD JOIN MAU ON THE CANOE AND WATCH HIM GO INTO THE HULL IT APPEARED THAT AN OLD MAN WAS GOING TO REST
ElizabethLindsey_2010W IN FACT THE HULL OF THE CANOE IS THE WOMB OF THE VESSEL IT IS THE MOST ACCURATE PLACE TO FEEL THE RHYTHM AND SEQUENCE AND DIRECTION OF WAVES
ElizabethLindsey_2010W IT 'S WHAT HE HAD BEEN TRAINED TO DO SINCE HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD
ElizabethLindsey_2010W NOW SCIENCE MAY DISMISS THIS METHODOLOGY
ElizabethLindsey_2010W BUT POLYNESIAN NAVIGATORS USE IT TODAY
ElizabethLindsey_2010W BECAUSE IT PROVIDES THEM
ElizabethLindsey_2010W AN ACCURATE DETERMINATION OF THE ANGLE AND DIRECTION OF THEIR VESSEL
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THE PALU ALSO HAD AN UNCANNY ABILITY TO FORECAST WEATHER CONDITIONS DAYS IN ADVANCE SOMETIMES I 'D BE WITH MAU ON A CLOUD COVERED NIGHT AND WE 'D SIT AT THE EASTERNMOST COAST OF THE ISLAND AND HE WOULD LOOK OUT
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS INTELLECTUALLY AND SCIENTIFICALLY ARE EXTRAORDINARY AND THEY ARE SO RELEVANT FOR THESE TIMES THAT WE ARE IN WHEN WE ARE RIDING OUT STORMS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W WE ARE IN SUCH A CRITICAL MOMENT OF OUR COLLECTIVE HISTORY
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THEY HAVE BEEN COMPARED TO ASTRONAUTS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THESE ELDER NAVIGATORS WHO SAIL VAST OPEN OCEANS IN DOUBLE HULLED CANOES
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM A SMALL ISLAND
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THEIR CANOES
ElizabethLindsey_2010W WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE IT
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THE YEAR IS TWO THOUSAND AND TEN
ElizabethLindsey_2010W JUST AS THE WOMEN IN HAWAII
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THAT RAISED ME PREDICTED THE WORLD IS IN TROUBLE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY BLOATED WITH DATA
ElizabethLindsey_2010W YET STARVED FOR WISDOM
ElizabethLindsey_2010W WE 'RE CONNECTED TWENTY FOUR SEVEN
ElizabethLindsey_2010W FEAR DEPRESSION AND LONELINESS IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH WE MUST COURSE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W YOUR SOCIETY WORSHIPS THE JESTER
ElizabethLindsey_2010W WHILE THE KING STANDS IN PLAIN CLOTHES
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THE LINK BETWEEN THE PAST AND THE FUTURE IS FRAGILE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THIS I KNOW INTIMATELY BECAUSE EVEN AS I TRAVEL THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
ElizabethLindsey_2010W TO LISTEN TO THESE STORIES AND RECORD THEM
ElizabethLindsey_2010W BY THE FACT THAT I NO LONGER
ElizabethLindsey_2010W REMEMBER THE NAMES OF THE WINDS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W AND I AM REMINDED
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THAT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THERE ARE CULTURES WITH VAST SUMS OF KNOWLEDGE IN THEM
ElizabethLindsey_2010W AS POTENT AS THE MICRONESIAN NAVIGATORS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THAT ARE GOING DISMISSED THAT THIS IS A TESTAMENT TO BRILLIANT
ElizabethLindsey_2010W BRILLIANT TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE AND WISDOM
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THAT IS VANISHING RAPIDLY BECAUSE WHEN AN ELDER DIES A LIBRARY IS BURNED AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD LIBRARIES ARE ABLAZE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W AND I REALIZE THROUGH A LESSON THAT HE SHARED
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THAT WE CONTINUE TO FIND OUR WAY AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAID
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THE ISLAND IS THE CANOE
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THE CANOE THE ISLAND AND WHAT HE MEANT WAS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W IF YOU ARE VOYAGING AND FAR FROM HOME
ElizabethLindsey_2010W YOUR VERY SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON EVERYONE ABOARD
ElizabethLindsey_2010W YOU CANNOT MAKE THE VOYAGE ALONE YOU WERE NEVER MEANT TO
ElizabethLindsey_2010W THIS WHOLE NOTION OF EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF IS COMPLETELY UNSUSTAINABLE IT ALWAYS
ElizabethLindsey_2010W TRUE NAVIGATION
ElizabethLindsey_2010W BEGINS IN THE HUMAN HEART
