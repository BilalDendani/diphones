RoryStewart_2011G WHY DID WE INVADE AFGHANISTAN THE QUESTION IS
RoryStewart_2011G WHY ARE WE STILL IN AFGHANISTAN ONE DECADE LATER
RoryStewart_2011G WHY ARE WE SPENDING DOLLAR ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE BILLION WHY HAVE WE GOT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND TROOPS ON THE GROUND WHY WERE MORE PEOPLE KILLED
RoryStewart_2011G LAST MONTH THAN IN ANY PRECEDING MONTH OF THIS CONFLICT
RoryStewart_2011G TWENTY YEARS HAS BEEN THE AGE OF INTERVENTION
RoryStewart_2011G AND AFGHANISTAN IS SIMPLY ONE ACT IN A FIVE ACT TRAGEDY WE CAME OUT OF THE END OF THE COLD WAR
RoryStewart_2011G WE FACED BOSNIA
RoryStewart_2011G AND THEN WE REDISCOVERED OUR CONFIDENCE IN THE THIRD ACT WE WENT INTO BOSNIA AND KOSOVO AND WE SEEMED TO SUCCEED IN THE FOURTH ACT WITH OUR HUBRIS OUR OVERCONFIDENCE DEVELOPING
RoryStewart_2011G WE INVADED IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN
RoryStewart_2011G SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE DOING WHY ARE WE STILL STUCK IN AFGHANISTAN AND THE ANSWER OF COURSE THAT WE KEEP BEING GIVEN
RoryStewart_2011G IS AS FOLLOWS WE 'RE TOLD THAT WE WENT INTO AFGHANISTAN
RoryStewart_2011G AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN THE STORY THAT WE 'RE TOLD IS THAT THERE WAS A LIGHT FOOTPRINT INITIALLY
RoryStewart_2011G IN OTHER WORDS THAT WE ENDED UP IN A SITUATION WHERE WE DIDN 'T HAVE ENOUGH TROOPS WE DIDN 'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES THAT AFGHANS WERE FRUSTRATED THEY FELT THERE WASN 'T ENOUGH PROGRESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND SECURITY AND THEREFORE THE TALIBAN CAME BACK
RoryStewart_2011G WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED OFF ON A SURGE THAT WE FINALLY HAD IN THE WORDS OF SECRETARY CLINTON
RoryStewart_2011G THE STRATEGY THE LEADERSHIP AND THE RESOURCES SO AS THE PRESIDENT NOW REASSURES US WE ARE ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS
RoryStewart_2011G ALL OF THIS IS WRONG
RoryStewart_2011G EVERY ONE OF THOSE STATEMENTS IS WRONG
RoryStewart_2011G AFGHANISTAN DOES NOT POSE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO GLOBAL SECURITY
RoryStewart_2011G IT IS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THE TALIBAN WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY
RoryStewart_2011G IT 'S EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT AL QAEDA WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE ITS ABILITY TO HARM THE UNITED STATES OR HARM EUROPE
RoryStewart_2011G BECAUSE THIS ISN 'T THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY S ANYMORE IF THE
RoryStewart_2011G AND THESE TROOPS THAT WE BROUGHT IN
RoryStewart_2011G IT 'S A GREAT PICTURE OF DAVID BECKHAM THERE ON THE SUB MACHINE GUN MADE THE SITUATION WORSE NOT BETTER WHEN I WALKED ACROSS AFGHANISTAN IN THE WINTER OF TWO THOUSAND AND ONE TWO THOUSAND AND TWO WHAT I SAW WAS SCENES LIKE THIS
RoryStewart_2011G A GIRL IF YOU 'RE LUCKY IN THE CORNER OF A DARK ROOM
RoryStewart_2011G LUCKY TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE KORAN
RoryStewart_2011G BUT IN THOSE EARLY DAYS WHEN WE 'RE TOLD WE DIDN 'T HAVE ENOUGH TROOPS AND ENOUGH RESOURCES WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN AFGHANISTAN WITHIN A FEW MONTHS THERE WERE TWO AND A HALF MILLION MORE GIRLS IN SCHOOL
RoryStewart_2011G AND WE HAD PROGRESS IN THE FREE MEDIA WE HAD PROGRESS IN ELECTIONS ALL OF THIS WITH THE SO CALLED LIGHT FOOTPRINT
RoryStewart_2011G BUT WHEN WE BEGAN TO BRING MORE MONEY
RoryStewart_2011G WHEN WE BEGAN TO INVEST MORE RESOURCES THINGS GOT WORSE NOT BETTER HOW WELL FIRST SEE IF YOU PUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR INTO A COUNTRY LIKE AFGHANISTAN WHERE THE ENTIRE REVENUE OF THE AFGHAN STATE IS ONE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR YOU DROWN EVERYTHING
RoryStewart_2011G IT 'S NOT SIMPLY CORRUPTION AND WASTE THAT YOU CREATE YOU ESSENTIALLY REPLACE THE PRIORITIES OF THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT THE ELECTED AFGHAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE MICROMANAGING TENDENCIES OF FOREIGNERS ON SHORT TOURS WITH THEIR OWN PRIORITIES AND THE SAME IS TRUE FOR THE TROOPS
RoryStewart_2011G CONSIDERABLY MORE ISLAMIST THAN WE 'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MAN FOR EXAMPLE MULLAH MUSTAFA TRIED TO SHOOT ME
RoryStewart_2011G AND I WAS TOO AFRAID ON THIS OCCASION
RoryStewart_2011G TO ASK HIM HAVING RUN FOR AN HOUR THROUGH THE DESERT AND TAKEN REFUGE IN THIS HOUSE WHY HE HAD TURNED UP AND WANTED TO HAVE HIS PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN WITH ME
RoryStewart_2011G BUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER I ASKED HIM WHY HE HAD TRIED TO SHOOT ME
RoryStewart_2011G AND MULLAH MUSTAFA HE 'S THE MAN WITH THE PEN AND PAPER EXPLAINED THAT THE MAN SITTING IMMEDIATELY TO THE LEFT AS YOU LOOK AT THE PHOTOGRAPH NADIR SHAH HAD BET HIM THAT HE COULDN 'T HIT ME NOW THIS IS NOT TO SAY AFGHANISTAN IS A PLACE FULL OF PEOPLE LIKE MULLAH MUSTAFA IT 'S NOT IT 'S A WONDERFUL PLACE
RoryStewart_2011G FULL OF INCREDIBLE ENERGY AND INTELLIGENCE BUT IT IS A PLACE WHERE THE PUTTING IN OF THE TROOPS HAS INCREASED THE VIOLENCE RATHER THAN DECREASED IT
RoryStewart_2011G TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE ANTHONY FITZHERBERT AN AGRICULTURAL ENGINEER COULD TRAVEL THROUGH HELMAND COULD STAY IN NAD ALI SANGIN AND GHORESH WHICH ARE NOW THE NAMES OF VILLAGES WHERE FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE TODAY HE COULD NEVER DO THAT
RoryStewart_2011G SO THE IDEA THAT WE DEPLOYED THE TROOPS TO RESPOND TO THE TALIBAN INSURGENCY IS MISTAKEN RATHER THAN PRECEDING THE INSURGENCY THE TALIBAN FOLLOWED THE TROOP DEPLOYMENT AND AS FAR AS I 'M CONCERNED THE TROOP DEPLOYMENT CAUSED THEIR RETURN
RoryStewart_2011G NOW IS THIS A NEW IDEA NO THERE HAVE BEEN ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE SAYING THIS OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS I RAN A CENTER AT HARVARD FROM TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND AND TEN
RoryStewart_2011G AND THERE WERE PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL SEMPLE THERE WHO SPEAK AFGHAN LANGUAGES FLUENTLY WHO 'VE TRAVELED TO ALMOST EVERY DISTRICT IN THE COUNTRY ANDREW WILDER FOR EXAMPLE
RoryStewart_2011G SERVED HIS WHOLE LIFE IN PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN PAUL FISHSTEIN WHO BEGAN WORKING THERE IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT WORKED FOR SAVE THE CHILDREN RAN THE AFGHAN RESEARCH AND EVALUATION UNIT
RoryStewart_2011G THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE ABLE TO SAY CONSISTENTLY
RoryStewart_2011G THAT THE INCREASE IN DEVELOPMENT AID WAS MAKING AFGHANISTAN LESS SECURE NOT MORE SECURE THAT THE COUNTER INSURGENCY STRATEGY WAS NOT WORKING AND WOULD NOT WORK
RoryStewart_2011G AND YET NOBODY LISTENED TO THEM INSTEAD
RoryStewart_2011G THERE WAS A LITANY OF ASTONISHING OPTIMISM
RoryStewart_2011G BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR EVERY GENERAL CAME IN SAYING
RoryStewart_2011G I 'VE INHERITED A DISMAL SITUATION BUT FINALLY
RoryStewart_2011G I HAVE THE RIGHT RESOURCES AND THE CORRECT STRATEGY WHICH WILL DELIVER IN GENERAL BARNO 'S WORD IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR THE DECISIVE YEAR
RoryStewart_2011G WELL GUESS WHAT IT DIDN 'T BUT IT WASN 'T SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT
RoryStewart_2011G GENERAL ABUZAID SAYING THAT HE HAD THE STRATEGY AND THE RESOURCES TO DELIVER IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE THE DECISIVE YEAR OR GENERAL DAVID RICHARDS TO COME IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND SAY HE HAD THE STRATEGY AND THE RESOURCES TO DELIVER THE CRUNCH YEAR OR IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
RoryStewart_2011G THE NORWEGIAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER ESPEN EIDE TO SAY THAT THAT WOULD DELIVER THE DECISIVE YEAR OR IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT MAJOR GENERAL CHAMPOUX TO COME IN AND SAY
RoryStewart_2011G HE WOULD DELIVER THE DECISIVE YEAR OR IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE MY GREAT FRIEND GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL WHO SAID THAT HE WAS KNEE DEEP IN THE DECISIVE YEAR OR IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THE U K FOREIGN SECRETARY DAVID MILIBAND WHO SAID THAT AT LAST WE WOULD DELIVER
RoryStewart_2011G WELL THE ANSWER OF COURSE IS IF YOU SPEND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE BILLION OR ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN A COUNTRY YOU CO OPT ALMOST EVERYBODY
RoryStewart_2011G EVEN THE AID AGENCIES WHO BEGIN TO RECEIVE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM THE U S AND THE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS TO BUILD SCHOOLS AND CLINICS ARE SOMEWHAT DISINCLINED TO CHALLENGE THE IDEA THAT AFGHANISTAN IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO GLOBAL SECURITY
RoryStewart_2011G WOULDN 'T GET THE MONEY TO BUILD THEIR HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS IT 'S ALSO VERY DIFFICULT TO CONFRONT A GENERAL WITH MEDALS ON HIS CHEST IT 'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR A POLITICIAN BECAUSE YOU 'RE AFRAID THAT MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST IN VAIN YOU FEEL DEEP DEEP GUILT YOU EXAGGERATE YOUR FEARS
RoryStewart_2011G AND YOU 'RE TERRIFIED ABOUT THE HUMILIATION OF DEFEAT
RoryStewart_2011G WHAT IS THE SOLUTION TO THIS
RoryStewart_2011G WELL THE SOLUTION TO THIS IS WE NEED TO FIND A WAY THAT PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL SEMPLE OR THOSE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE TELLING THE TRUTH WHO KNOW THE COUNTRY WHO 'VE SPENT THIRTY YEARS ON THE GROUND AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL
RoryStewart_2011G THE MISSING COMPONENT OF THIS
RoryStewart_2011G AFGHANS THEMSELVES WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON
RoryStewart_2011G WE NEED TO SOMEHOW GET THEIR MESSAGE TO THE POLICYMAKERS AND THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO BECAUSE OF OUR STRUCTURES THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO CHANGE IS THE STRUCTURES OF OUR GOVERNMENT
RoryStewart_2011G VERY VERY SADLY OUR FOREIGN SERVICES THE UNITED NATIONS THE MILITARY
RoryStewart_2011G IN THESE COUNTRIES HAVE VERY LITTLE IDEA OF WHAT 'S GOING ON THE AVERAGE BRITISH SOLDIER IS ON A TOUR OF ONLY SIX MONTHS
RoryStewart_2011G ITALIAN SOLDIERS ON TOURS OF FOUR MONTHS
RoryStewart_2011G THE AMERICAN MILITARY ON TOURS OF TWELVE MONTHS
RoryStewart_2011G DIPLOMATS ARE LOCKED IN EMBASSY COMPOUNDS WHEN THEY GO OUT THEY TRAVEL IN THESE CURIOUS ARMORED VEHICLES WITH THESE SOMEWHAT THREATENING SECURITY TEAMS WHO READY TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN ADVANCE WHO SAY YOU CAN ONLY STAY ON THE GROUND FOR AN HOUR IN THE BRITISH EMBASSY IN AFGHANISTAN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
RoryStewart_2011G AN EMBASSY OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE THERE WERE ONLY THREE PEOPLE WHO COULD SPEAK DARI THE MAIN LANGUAGE OF AFGHANISTAN AT A DECENT LEVEL AND THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PASHTO SPEAKER
RoryStewart_2011G IN THE AFGHAN SECTION IN LONDON RESPONSIBLE FOR GOVERNING AFGHAN POLICY ON THE GROUND
RoryStewart_2011G I WAS TOLD LAST YEAR THAT THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE STAFF MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE IN THAT SECTION WHO HAD EVER SERVED ON A POSTING IN AFGHANISTAN
RoryStewart_2011G SO WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT INSTITUTIONAL CULTURE AND I COULD MAKE THE SAME POINTS ABOUT THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED NATIONS
RoryStewart_2011G SECONDLY WE NEED TO AIM OFF OF THE OPTIMISM OF THE GENERALS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 'RE A LITTLE BIT SUSPICIOUS THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT OPTIMISM IS IN THE DNA OF THE MILITARY THAT WE DON 'T RESPOND TO IT WITH QUITE AS MUCH ALACRITY
RoryStewart_2011G AND THIRDLY WE NEED TO HAVE SOME HUMILITY WE NEED TO BEGIN FROM THE POSITION
RoryStewart_2011G THAT OUR KNOWLEDGE OUR POWER
RoryStewart_2011G OUR LEGITIMACY IS LIMITED THIS DOESN 'T MEAN THAT INTERVENTION AROUND THE WORLD IS A DISASTER IT ISN 'T BOSNIA AND KOSOVO
RoryStewart_2011G WERE SIGNAL SUCCESSES
RoryStewart_2011G HAS LARGELY HAPPENED A MILLION PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN RETURNED BORDERS BETWEEN THE BOSNIAK TERRITORY AND THE BOSNIAN SERB TERRITORY HAVE CALMED DOWN
RoryStewart_2011G THE NATIONAL ARMY HAS SHRUNK
RoryStewart_2011G THE CRIME RATES IN BOSNIA TODAY ARE LOWER THAN THEY ARE IN SWEDEN
RoryStewart_2011G THIS HAS BEEN DONE BY AN INCREDIBLE PRINCIPLED EFFORT BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND OF COURSE ABOVE ALL BY BOSNIANS THEMSELVES
RoryStewart_2011G BUT YOU NEED TO LOOK AT CONTEXT AND THIS IS WHAT WE 'VE LOST IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN THOSE PLACES WHAT REALLY MATTERED
RoryStewart_2011G LOT OF THE SECRET OF OUR SUCCESS
RoryStewart_2011G WAS OUR HUMILITY
RoryStewart_2011G WAS THE TENTATIVE NATURE OF OUR ENGAGEMENT WE CRITICIZED PEOPLE A LOT IN BOSNIA FOR BEING QUITE SLOW TO TAKE ON WAR CRIMINALS WE CRITICIZED THEM FOR BEING QUITE SLOW TO RETURN REFUGEES BUT THAT SLOWNESS THAT CAUTION THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON INITIALLY SAID THAT AMERICAN TROOPS WOULD ONLY BE DEPLOYED FOR A YEAR TURNED OUT TO BE A STRENGTH
RoryStewart_2011G AND IT HELPED US TO PUT OUR PRIORITIES RIGHT ONE OF THE SADDEST THINGS ABOUT OUR INVOLVEMENT IN AFGHANISTAN
RoryStewart_2011G IS THAT WE 'VE GOT OUR PRIORITIES OUT OF SYNC WE 'RE NOT MATCHING OUR RESOURCES TO OUR PRIORITIES BECAUSE IF WHAT WE 'RE INTERESTED IN IS TERRORISM
RoryStewart_2011G PAKISTAN IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN AFGHANISTAN IF WHAT WE 'RE INTERESTED IN IS REGIONAL STABILITY EGYPT IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT IF WHAT WE 'RE WORRIED ABOUT IS POVERTY AND DEVELOPMENT SUB SAHARAN AFRICA IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT
RoryStewart_2011G THIS DOESN 'T MEAN THAT AFGHANISTAN DOESN 'T MATTER BUT THAT IT 'S ONE OF FORTY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD WITH WHICH WE NEED TO ENGAGE
RoryStewart_2011G SO IF I CAN FINISH WITH A METAPHOR
RoryStewart_2011G FOR INTERVENTION WHAT WE NEED TO THINK OF
RoryStewart_2011G IS SOMETHING LIKE MOUNTAIN RESCUE
RoryStewart_2011G WHY MOUNTAIN RESCUE BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT INTERVENTION THEY IMAGINE THAT SOME SCIENTIFIC THEORY THE RAND CORPORATION GOES AROUND COUNTING FORTY THREE PREVIOUS INSURGENCIES PRODUCING MATHEMATICAL FORMULA SAYING YOU NEED ONE TRAINED COUNTER INSURGENT FOR EVERY TWENTY MEMBERS OF THE POPULATION
RoryStewart_2011G THIS IS THE WRONG WAY OF LOOKING AT IT YOU NEED TO LOOK AT IT IN THE WAY THAT YOU LOOK AT MOUNTAIN RESCUE WHEN YOU 'RE DOING MOUNTAIN RESCUE YOU DON 'T TAKE A DOCTORATE IN MOUNTAIN RESCUE YOU LOOK FOR SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS THE TERRAIN IT 'S ABOUT CONTEXT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CAN PREPARE
RoryStewart_2011G BUT THE AMOUNT OF PREPARATION YOU CAN DO IS LIMITED YOU CAN TAKE SOME WATER YOU CAN HAVE A MAP YOU CAN HAVE A PACK BUT WHAT REALLY MATTERS
RoryStewart_2011G IS TWO KINDS OF PROBLEMS PROBLEMS THAT OCCUR ON THE MOUNTAIN WHICH YOU COULDN 'T ANTICIPATE SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE ICE ON A SLOPE BUT WHICH YOU CAN GET AROUND AND PROBLEMS WHICH YOU COULDN 'T ANTICIPATE AND WHICH YOU CAN 'T GET AROUND LIKE A SUDDEN BLIZZARD OR AN AVALANCHE OR A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER
RoryStewart_2011G AND THE KEY TO THIS IS A GUIDE WHO HAS BEEN ON THAT MOUNTAIN
RoryStewart_2011G IN EVERY TEMPERATURE AT EVERY PERIOD
RoryStewart_2011G A GUIDE WHO ABOVE ALL KNOWS WHEN TO TURN BACK
RoryStewart_2011G WHO DOESN 'T PRESS ON RELENTLESSLY WHEN CONDITIONS TURN AGAINST THEM WHAT WE LOOK FOR IN FIREMEN IN CLIMBERS IN POLICEMEN AND WHAT WE SHOULD LOOK FOR IN INTERVENTION IS INTELLIGENT RISK TAKERS NOT PEOPLE WHO PLUNGE BLIND OFF A CLIFF
RoryStewart_2011G NOT PEOPLE WHO JUMP INTO A BURNING ROOM BUT WHO WEIGH THEIR RISKS WEIGH THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES BECAUSE THE WORST THING WE HAVE DONE IN AFGHANISTAN IS THIS IDEA THAT FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION
RoryStewart_2011G IT MAKES FAILURE
RoryStewart_2011G THAT IF WE CAN OFTEN DO MUCH LESS THAN WE PRETEND WE CAN DO MUCH MORE THAN WE FEAR
RoryStewart_2011G THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPLAUSE THANK YOU THANK YOU
RoryStewart_2011G THE PROBLEM IN LIBYA IS THAT WE ARE ALWAYS PUSHING FOR THE BLACK OR WHITE WE IMAGINE THERE ARE ONLY TWO CHOICES EITHER FULL ENGAGEMENT AND TROOP DEPLOYMENT
RoryStewart_2011G OR TOTAL ISOLATION AND WE ARE ALWAYS BEING TEMPTED UP TO OUR NECK WE PUT OUR TOES IN AND WE GO UP TO OUR NECK
RoryStewart_2011G WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE IN LIBYA IS WE SHOULD HAVE STUCK TO THE U N RESOLUTION WE SHOULD HAVE LIMITED OURSELVES VERY VERY STRICTLY TO THE PROTECTION OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN BENGHAZI
RoryStewart_2011G HAD NO PLANES WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS INSTEAD OF WHICH WE 'VE ALLOWED OURSELVES TO BE TEMPTED TOWARDS REGIME CHANGE
RoryStewart_2011G IN DOING SO WE 'VE DESTROYED OUR CREDIBILITY WITH THE SECURITY COUNCIL WHICH MEANS
