BecciManson_2012G WE 'RE PALE GRAY CREATURES WE HIDE IN DARK WINDOWLESS ROOMS AND GENERALLY AVOID SUNLIGHT WE MAKE SKINNY MODELS SKINNIER PERFECT SKIN MORE PERFECT AND THE IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE
BecciManson_2012G AND WE GET CRITICIZED IN THE PRESS ALL THE TIME BUT SOME OF US ARE ACTUALLY TALENTED ARTISTS WITH YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND A REAL APPRECIATION FOR IMAGES AND PHOTOGRAPHY
BecciManson_2012G I ALONG WITH HUNDREDS OF OTHER VOLUNTEERS KNEW WE COULDN 'T JUST SIT AT HOME SO I DECIDED TO JOIN THEM FOR THREE WEEKS ON MAY THE THIRTEENTH I MADE MY WAY TO THE TOWN OF ÅŒFUNATO IT 'S A SMALL FISHING TOWN IN IWATE PREFECTURE
BecciManson_2012G ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ONE OF THE FIRST THAT WAS HIT BY THE WAVE
BecciManson_2012G THE WATERS HERE HAVE BEEN RECORDED AT REACHING OVER TWENTY FOUR METERS IN HEIGHT
BecciManson_2012G AND TRAVELED OVER TWO MILES INLAND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE TOWN HAD BEEN DEVASTATED
BecciManson_2012G WE PULLED DEBRIS FROM CANALS AND DITCHES WE CLEANED SCHOOLS WE DE MUDDED AND GUTTED HOMES READY FOR RENOVATION AND REHABILITATION WE CLEARED TONS AND TONS OF STINKING ROTTING FISH CARCASSES FROM THE LOCAL FISH PROCESSING PLANT WE GOT DIRTY AND WE LOVED IT
BecciManson_2012G EVERYTHING HAD TO BE LEFT BEHIND AT THE END OF MY FIRST WEEK THERE I FOUND MYSELF HELPING OUT IN AN EVACUATION CENTER IN THE TOWN I WAS HELPING CLEAN THE ONSEN THE COMMUNAL ONSEN THE HUGE GIANT BATHTUBS THIS HAPPENED TO ALSO BE A PLACE IN THE TOWN
BecciManson_2012G NOW IT WAS EMOTIONAL AND IT WAS INSPIRING AND I 'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX BUT IT WASN 'T UNTIL I HAD ACTUALLY GOTTEN OUTSIDE OF MY BOX THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED
BecciManson_2012G AS I LOOKED THROUGH THE PHOTOS THERE WERE SOME WERE OVER A HUNDRED YEARS OLD SOME STILL IN THE ENVELOPE FROM THE PROCESSING LAB I COULDN 'T HELP BUT THINK AS A RETOUCHER THAT I COULD FIX THAT TEAR AND MEND THAT SCRATCH AND
BecciManson_2012G I KNEW HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO COULD DO THE SAME
BecciManson_2012G SO WE STARTED RETOUCHING PHOTOS
BecciManson_2012G THIS WAS THE VERY FIRST NOT TERRIBLY DAMAGED BUT WHERE THE WATER HAD CAUSED THAT DISCOLORATION ON THE GIRL 'S FACE HAD TO BE REPAIRED WITH SUCH ACCURACY AND DELICACY
BecciManson_2012G OTHERWISE THAT LITTLE GIRL ISN 'T GOING TO LOOK LIKE THAT LITTLE GIRL ANYMORE AND SURELY THAT 'S AS TRAGIC AS HAVING THE PHOTO DAMAGED
BecciManson_2012G OVER TIME MORE PHOTOS CAME IN THANKFULLY AND MORE RETOUCHERS WERE NEEDED AND SO I REACHED OUT AGAIN ON FACEBOOK AND LINKEDIN AND WITHIN FIVE DAYS EIGHTY PEOPLE WANTED TO HELP FROM TWELVE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WITHIN TWO WEEKS I HAD ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE WANTING TO JOIN IN
BecciManson_2012G WITHIN JAPAN BY JULY WE 'D BRANCHED OUT TO THE NEIGHBORING TOWN OF RIKUZENTAKATA FURTHER NORTH TO A TOWN CALLED YAMADA ONCE A WEEK WE WOULD SET UP OUR SCANNING EQUIPMENT IN THE TEMPORARY PHOTO LIBRARIES THAT HAD BEEN SET UP WHERE PEOPLE WERE RECLAIMING THEIR PHOTOS
BecciManson_2012G THE TIME IT TOOK HOWEVER TO GET IT
BecciManson_2012G BACK IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY AND IT DEPENDED OBVIOUSLY ON THE DAMAGE INVOLVED IT COULD TAKE AN HOUR IT COULD TAKE WEEKS IT COULD TAKE MONTHS THE KIMONO IN THIS SHOT PRETTY MUCH HAD TO BE HAND DRAWN OR PIECED TOGETHER
BecciManson_2012G PICKING OUT THE REMAINING PARTS OF COLOR AND DETAIL THAT THE WATER HADN 'T DAMAGED IT WAS VERY TIME CONSUMING
BecciManson_2012G NOW ALL THESE PHOTOS HAD BEEN DAMAGED BY WATER SUBMERGED IN SALT WATER COVERED IN BACTERIA IN SEWAGE SOMETIMES EVEN IN OIL ALL OF WHICH OVER TIME IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO DAMAGE THEM SO HAND CLEANING THEM WAS A HUGE PART OF THE PROJECT WE COULDN 'T RETOUCH THE PHOTO UNLESS IT WAS CLEANED
BecciManson_2012G DRY AND RECLAIMED
BecciManson_2012G THE LADY WHO BROUGHT US THESE PHOTOS WAS LUCKY AS FAR AS THE PHOTOS GO
BecciManson_2012G WHEN SHE COLLECTED THE PHOTOS FROM US SHE SHARED A BIT OF HER STORY WITH US HER PHOTOS WERE FOUND BY HER HUSBAND 'S COLLEAGUES AT A LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT IN THE DEBRIS A LONG WAY FROM WHERE THE HOME HAD ONCE STOOD AND THEY 'D RECOGNIZED HIM
BecciManson_2012G THE DAY OF THE TSUNAMI HE 'D ACTUALLY BEEN IN CHARGE OF MAKING SURE THE TSUNAMI GATES WERE CLOSED HE HAD TO GO TOWARDS THE WATER AS THE SIRENS SOUNDED
BecciManson_2012G FOR HER DESPITE ALL OF THIS THOSE PHOTOS WERE THE PERFECT GIFT BACK TO HIM SOMETHING HE COULD LOOK AT AGAIN SOMETHING HE REMEMBERED FROM BEFORE THAT
BecciManson_2012G HELPED US GET NINETY FAMILIES HUNDREDS OF PHOTOGRAPHS BACK FULLY RESTORED AND RETOUCHED DURING THIS TIME WE HADN 'T REALLY SPENT MORE THAN ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS MOST OF WHICH WAS PRINTER INKS
BecciManson_2012G WE TAKE PHOTOS CONSTANTLY A PHOTO IS A REMINDER OF SOMEONE OR SOMETHING
BecciManson_2012G A PLACE A RELATIONSHIP A LOVED ONE THEY 'RE OUR MEMORY KEEPERS AND OUR HISTORIES THE LAST THING WE WOULD GRAB
BecciManson_2012G AND THE FIRST THING YOU 'D GO BACK TO LOOK FOR THAT 'S ALL THIS PROJECT WAS ABOUT
BecciManson_2012G ABOUT RESTORING THOSE LITTLE BITS OF HUMANITY GIVING SOMEONE THAT CONNECTION BACK
BecciManson_2012G WHEN A PHOTO LIKE THIS CAN BE RETURNED TO SOMEONE LIKE THIS IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE PERSON RECEIVING IT
BecciManson_2012G THE PROJECT 'S ALSO MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE RETOUCHERS FOR SOME OF THEM IT 'S GIVEN THEM A CONNECTION TO SOMETHING BIGGER GIVING SOMETHING BACK USING THEIR TALENTS ON SOMETHING OTHER THAN SKINNY MODELS AND PERFECT SKIN
BecciManson_2012G I WOULD LIKE TO CONCLUDE BY READING AN EMAIL I GOT FROM ONE OF THEM CINDY THE DAY I FINALLY GOT BACK FROM JAPAN AFTER SIX MONTHS
BecciManson_2012G AS I WORKED I COULDN 'T HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS AND THE STORIES REPRESENTED IN THE IMAGES ONE IN PARTICULAR
BecciManson_2012G A PHOTO OF WOMEN OF ALL AGES FROM GRANDMOTHER TO LITTLE GIRL GATHERED AROUND A BABY STRUCK A CHORD BECAUSE A SIMILAR PHOTO FROM MY FAMILY MY GRANDMOTHER AND MOTHER MYSELF AND NEWBORN DAUGHTER HANGS ON OUR WALL
BecciManson_2012G ACROSS THE GLOBE THROUGHOUT THE AGES OUR BASIC NEEDS ARE JUST THE SAME AREN 'T THEY THANK YOU
