AnupamMishra_2009I WE SHOULD NOT MOVE QUICKLY TO THE DESERT SO
AnupamMishra_2009I SO WELCOME TO THE GOLDEN DESERT INDIAN DESERT IT RECEIVES THE LEAST RAINFALL IN THE COUNTRY LOWEST
AnupamMishra_2009I HUNDRED METERS AND IN MOST PARTS IT IS SALINE NOT FIT FOR DRINKING SO YOU
AnupamMishra_2009I THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY IN MOST OF THE VILLAGES BUT SUPPOSE YOU USE THE GREEN TECHNOLOGY SOLAR PUMPS THEY ARE OF NO USE IN THIS AREA SO WELCOME TO THE GOLDEN DESERT
AnupamMishra_2009I CLOUDS SELDOM VISIT THIS AREA BUT WE FIND FORTY DIFFERENT NAMES OF CLOUDS IN THIS DIALECT USED
AnupamMishra_2009I A NUMBER OF TECHNIQUES TO HARVEST RAIN THIS IS A NEW WORK IT'S A NEW PROGRAM BUT FOR THE DESERT SOCIETY THIS IS NO PROGRAM THIS IS THEIR LIFE AND THEY
AnupamMishra_2009I AND YOU CAN NOTICE THEY HAVE CREATED A KIND OF FALSE
AnupamMishra_2009I THE DESERT IS THERE SAND DUNES SOME SMALL FIELD AND THIS IS ALL
AnupamMishra_2009I YOU CAN NOTICE THE SMALL HOLES THE WATER WILL FALL ON THIS CATCHMENT AND THERE IS A SLOPE SOMETIMES
AnupamMishra_2009I AND ARCHITECTS DO NOT CARE ABOUT SLOPES IN BATHROOMS BUT HERE THEY WILL CARE PROPERLY AND THE WATER WILL GO WHERE IT SHOULD GO AND THEN IT IS FORTY FEET DEEP
AnupamMishra_2009I THE WATERPROOFING IS DONE PERFECTLY BETTER THAN OUR CITY CONTRACTORS BECAUSE NOT A SINGLE DROP SHOULD GO WASTE IN THIS THEY COLLECT ONE
AnupamMishra_2009I HUNDRED THOUSAND LITERS IN ONE SEASON AND THIS IS PURE DRINKING WATER BELOW THE SURFACE THERE IS HARD SALINE WATER BUT NOW YOU CAN HAVE
AnupamMishra_2009I WE OFTEN USE A TERM CALLED BYLAWS BECAUSE WE ARE USED TO GET
AnupamMishra_2009I THINGS BUT HERE IT IS UNWRITTEN BY LAW AND PEOPLE MAKE THEIR HOUSE AND THE WATER STORAGE TANKS THESE RAISED UP PLATFORMS JUST LIKE THIS
AnupamMishra_2009I FIFTEEN FEET DEEP AND COLLECT RAIN WATER FROM ROOF THERE IS A SMALL PIPE AND FROM THEIR COURTYARD IT CAN ALSO HARVEST SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND IN A
AnupamMishra_2009I GOOD MONSOON ANOTHER BIG ONE THIS IS OF COURSE OUT OF THE HARDCORE DESERT AREA THIS IS NEAR JAIPUR THIS IS CALLED THE JAIGARH FORT AND IT CAN
AnupamMishra_2009I SIX MILLION GALLONS OF RAINWATER IN ONE SEASON THE AGE IS FOUR HUNDRED YEARS
AnupamMishra_2009I SO SINCE FOUR HUNDRED YEARS IT HAS BEEN GIVING YOU ALMOST SIX MILLION GALLONS OF WATER PER SEASON YOU CAN
AnupamMishra_2009I THE PRICE OF THAT WATER IT DRAWS WATER FROM FIFTEEN KILOMETERS OF CANALS YOU CAN SEE A MODERN ROAD HARDLY FIFTY YEARS
AnupamMishra_2009I IT CAN BREAK SOMETIMES BUT THIS FOUR HUNDRED YEAR OLD CANAL WHICH DRAWS WATER IS IS MAINTAINED FOR SO MANY GENERATIONS
AnupamMishra_2009I OF COURSE IF YOU WANT TO GO INSIDE THE TWO DOORS ARE LOCKED BUT THEY CAN BE OPENED FOR TED PEOPLE AND
AnupamMishra_2009I THEM YOU CAN SEE PERSON COMING UP WITH TWO CANISTERS OF WATER AND THE WATER
AnupamMishra_2009I THESE ARE NOT EMPTY CANISTERS WATER LEVEL IS RIGHT UP TO THIS IT CAN
AnupamMishra_2009I THE COLOR THE TASTE THE PURITY OF THIS WATER AND THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL ZERO B TYPE OF WATER BECAUSE IT COMES FROM THE CLOUDS PURE DISTILLED WATER
AnupamMishra_2009I STOP FOR A QUICK COMMERCIAL BREAK AND THEN WE COME BACK TO THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS THE GOVERNMENT
AnupamMishra_2009I THIS IS A VERY BACKWARD AREA AND WE SHOULD BRING A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT TO BRING WATER FROM THE HIMALAYAS THAT'S WHY I SAID THAT THIS IS A COMMERCIAL
AnupamMishra_2009I BUT WE WILL COME BACK ONCE AGAIN TO THE
AnupamMishra_2009I WATER FROM THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED KILOMETERS AWAY SOON IT BECOME LIKE THIS IN MANY PORTIONS WATER HYACINTH COVERED
AnupamMishra_2009I THESE BIG CANALS LIKE ANYTHING OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME AREAS WHERE WATER IS REACHING I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT IS NOT REACHING AT ALL BUT THE TAIL END THE
AnupamMishra_2009I YOU WILL NOTICE IN BIKANER THINGS LIKE THIS WHERE THE WATER HYACINTH COULDN'T GROW THE
AnupamMishra_2009I SAND IS FLOWING IN THESE CANALS THE BONUS IS THAT YOU CAN FIND WILDLIFE AROUND IT
AnupamMishra_2009I WE HAD FULL PAGE ADVERTISEMENTS SOME THIRTY YEARS TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN THIS CANAL CAME THEY SAID THAT
AnupamMishra_2009I YOUR TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS THESE NEW CEMENT TANKS WILL SUPPLY YOU PIPED WATER IT'S A DREAM AND IT BECAME A DREAM ALSO BECAUSE
AnupamMishra_2009I SOON THE WATER WAS NOT ABLE TO REACH THESE AREAS AND PEOPLE STARTED RENOVATING THEIR OWN STRUCTURES
AnupamMishra_2009I THESE ARE ALL TRADITIONAL WATER STRUCTURES WHICH WE WON 'T BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN IN SUCH A SHORT TIME BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT NO WOMAN IS STANDING ON THOSE AND
AnupamMishra_2009I THIS IS HEART OF DESERT THIS TOWN WAS ESTABLISHED EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS AGO I'M NOT SURE BY
AnupamMishra_2009I WAS THERE OR DELHI WAS THERE OR CHENNAI WAS THERE OR BANGALORE WAS THERE SO THIS WAS THE TERMINAL POINT FOR SILK ROUTE WELL CONNECTED EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS AGO THROUGH
AnupamMishra_2009I ABLE TO GO TO EUROPE BUT JAISALMER WAS WELL CONNECTED TO IT AND THIS IS THE SIXTEEN CENTIMETER
AnupamMishra_2009I SUCH A LIMITED RAINFALL AND HIGHEST COLORFUL LIFE FLOURISHED IN THESE AREAS YOU WON 'T FIND
