LisaHarouni_2011S REALITY TODAY
LisaHarouni_2011S FOR YOU VERY RAPIDLY A PHYSICAL OBJECT
LisaHarouni_2011S AND THE REASON WE CAN DO THIS IS THROUGH AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY CALLED ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING OR THREE D PRINTING THIS IS A THREE D PRINTER
LisaHarouni_2011S AND WE WOULD PASS THAT DATA WITH MATERIAL INTO A MACHINE AND A PROCESS THAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE MACHINE WOULD MEAN LAYER BY LAYER THAT PRODUCT WOULD BE BUILT AND WE CAN TAKE OUT THE PHYSICAL PRODUCT AND READY TO USE OR TO PERHAPS ASSEMBLE INTO SOMETHING ELSE
LisaHarouni_2011S BUT IF THESE MACHINES HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS WHY DON 'T WE KNOW ABOUT THEM BECAUSE TYPICALLY THEY 'VE BEEN
LisaHarouni_2011S TOO INEFFICIENT INACCESSIBLE
LisaHarouni_2011S NOT BEEN FAST ENOUGH THEY 'VE BEEN QUITE EXPENSIVE BUT TODAY IT IS BECOMING A REALITY THAT THEY ARE NOW BECOMING SUCCESSFUL MANY BARRIERS ARE BREAKING DOWN THAT MEANS THAT YOU GUYS WILL SOON BE ABLE TO ACCESS ONE OF THESE MACHINES IF NOT THIS MINUTE AND
LisaHarouni_2011S IT TYPICALLY READS CAD DATA WHICH IS A PRODUCT DESIGN DATA CREATED ON PROFESSIONAL PRODUCT DESIGN PROGRAMS AND HERE YOU CAN SEE AN ENGINEER IT COULD BE AN ARCHITECT OR IT COULD BE A PROFESSIONAL PRODUCT DESIGNER CREATE A PRODUCT IN THREE D
LisaHarouni_2011S AND THIS DATA GETS SENT TO A MACHINE THAT SLICES THE DATA INTO TWO DIMENSIONAL REPRESENTATIONS OF THAT PRODUCT ALL THE WAY THROUGH ALMOST LIKE SLICING IT LIKE SALAMI
LisaHarouni_2011S THIS MATERIAL THAT 'S DEPOSITED EITHER STARTS AS A LIQUID FORM OR A MATERIAL POWDER FORM
LisaHarouni_2011S AND OVER TIME QUITE RAPIDLY ACTUALLY IN A NUMBER OF HOURS WE CAN BUILD A PHYSICAL PRODUCT READY TO TAKE OUT OF THE MACHINE AND USE AND THIS IS QUITE
LisaHarouni_2011S AN EXTRAORDINARY IDEA BUT IT IS REALITY TODAY
LisaHarouni_2011S SO ALL THESE PRODUCTS THAT YOU CAN SEE ON THE SCREEN WERE MADE IN THE SAME WAY THEY WERE ALL THREE D PRINTED AND
LisaHarouni_2011S YOU CAN SEE THEY 'RE RANGING FROM SHOES
LisaHarouni_2011S BECAUSE WE 'RE TAKING THIS DATA IN THREE D FORM SLICING IT UP BEFORE IT GETS PAST THE MACHINE WE CAN ACTUALLY CREATE STRUCTURES THAT ARE MORE INTRICATE THAN ANY OTHER MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY OR IN FACT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD IN ANY OTHER WAY
LisaHarouni_2011S AND YOU CAN CREATE PARTS WITH MOVING COMPONENTS HINGES PARTS WITHIN PARTS SO IN SOME CASES WE CAN ABOLISH TOTALLY THE NEED FOR MANUAL LABOR
LisaHarouni_2011S IT SOUNDS GREAT IT IS GREAT
LisaHarouni_2011S WE CAN HAVE THREE D PRINTERS TODAY THAT BUILD STRUCTURES LIKE THESE THIS IS ALMOST THREE METERS HIGH
LisaHarouni_2011S AND THIS WAS BUILT BY DEPOSITING ARTIFICIAL SANDSTONE LAYER UPON LAYER IN LAYERS OF ABOUT FIVE MILLIMETERS TO TEN MM IN THICKNESS SLOWLY GROWING THIS STRUCTURE THIS WAS CREATED BY AN ARCHITECTURAL FIRM CALLED SHIRO AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY WALK INTO IT
LisaHarouni_2011S AND ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM THIS IS A MICROSTRUCTURE IT 'S CREATED DEPOSITING LAYERS OF ABOUT FOUR MICRONS SO REALLY THE RESOLUTION IS QUITE INCREDIBLE THE DETAIL THAT YOU CAN GET TODAY IS QUITE AMAZING
LisaHarouni_2011S SO WHO 'S USING IT TYPICALLY BECAUSE WE CAN CREATE PRODUCTS VERY RAPIDLY IT 'S BEEN USED BY
LisaHarouni_2011S PRODUCT DESIGNERS OR ANYONE WHO WANTED TO PROTOTYPE A PRODUCT AND VERY QUICKLY
LisaHarouni_2011S CREATE OR REITERATE A DESIGN AND ACTUALLY WHAT 'S QUITE AMAZING ABOUT THIS TECHNOLOGY AS WELL IS THAT YOU CAN CREATE BESPOKE PRODUCTS EN MASSE THERE 'S VERY LITTLE ECONOMIES OF SCALE
LisaHarouni_2011S SO YOU CAN NOW CREATE ONE OFFS VERY EASILY
LisaHarouni_2011S ARCHITECTS FOR EXAMPLE
LisaHarouni_2011S BUILDING OF THE FREE UNIVERSITY IN BERLIN AND IT WAS DESIGNED BY FOSTER AND PARTNERS AGAIN NOT BUILDABLE IN ANY OTHER WAY AND VERY HARD TO EVEN CREATE THIS BY HAND
LisaHarouni_2011S NOW THIS IS AN ENGINE COMPONENT IT WAS DEVELOPED BY A COMPANY CALLED WITHIN TECHNOLOGIES AND THREE T RPD
LisaHarouni_2011S WHICH MEANS IT 'S A MORE EFFICIENT PRODUCT YOU CAN 'T CREATE THIS WITH STANDARD MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES EVEN IF YOU TRIED TO DO IT MANUALLY
LisaHarouni_2011S AND THEN TAKING THIS IDEA OF CREATING A VERY DETAILED STRUCTURE WE CAN APPLY IT TO HONEYCOMB STRUCTURES AND USE THEM WITHIN IMPLANTS TYPICALLY AN IMPLANT IS MORE EFFECTIVE WITHIN THE BODY
LisaHarouni_2011S IF IT 'S MORE POROUS BECAUSE OUR BODY TISSUE WILL GROW INTO IT THERE 'S A LOWER CHANCE OF REJECTION
LisaHarouni_2011S BUT IT 'S VERY HARD TO CREATE THAT IN STANDARD WAYS WITH THREE D PRINTING WE 'RE SEEING TODAY THAT WE CAN CREATE MUCH BETTER IMPLANTS AND IN FACT BECAUSE WE CAN CREATE BESPOKE PRODUCTS EN MASSE ONE OFFS WE CAN CREATE IMPLANTS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO INDIVIDUALS
LisaHarouni_2011S SO AS YOU CAN SEE THIS TECHNOLOGY AND THE QUALITY OF WHAT COMES OUT OF THE MACHINES IS FANTASTIC AND WE 'RE STARTING TO SEE IT BEING USED FOR FINAL END PRODUCTS
LisaHarouni_2011S WHICH IS QUITE INCREDIBLE BUT THEN IT BEGS THE QUESTION WHY DON 'T WE ALL HAVE ONE IN OUR HOME BECAUSE SIMPLY MOST OF US HERE TODAY DON 'T KNOW HOW TO CREATE THE DATA THAT A THREE D PRINTER READS
LisaHarouni_2011S IF I GAVE YOU A THREE D PRINTER YOU WOULDN 'T KNOW HOW TO DIRECT IT TO MAKE WHAT YOU WANT IT TO BUT THERE ARE MORE AND MORE TECHNOLOGIES SOFTWARE AND PROCESSES TODAY THAT ARE BREAKING DOWN THOSE BARRIERS I BELIEVE WE 'RE AT A TIPPING POINT WHERE THIS IS NOW
LisaHarouni_2011S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN 'T AVOID
LisaHarouni_2011S YOU CAN DOWNLOAD PRODUCTS FROM THE WEB ANYTHING YOU WOULD HAVE ON YOUR DESKTOP
LisaHarouni_2011S LIKE PENS WHISTLES LEMON SQUEEZERS YOU CAN USE SOFTWARE LIKE GOOGLE SKETCHUP
LisaHarouni_2011S TO CREATE PRODUCTS FROM SCRATCH VERY EASILY
LisaHarouni_2011S BUT WHAT INTERESTS MY COMPANY THE MOST IS THE FACT THAT YOU CAN CREATE INDIVIDUAL UNIQUE PRODUCTS EN MASSE THERE 'S NO NEED TO DO A RUN OF THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS
LisaHarouni_2011S OR SEND THAT PRODUCT TO BE INJECTION MOLDED IN CHINA YOU CAN JUST MAKE IT PHYSICALLY ON THE SPOT
LisaHarouni_2011S WHICH MEANS THAT WE CAN NOW PRESENT TO THE PUBLIC
LisaHarouni_2011S IMAGINE THAT YOU CAN NOW ENGAGE WITH A BRAND
LisaHarouni_2011S AND INTERACT SO THAT YOU CAN PASS YOUR PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES TO THE PRODUCTS THAT YOU 'RE ABOUT TO BUY
LisaHarouni_2011S VIEW THE PRODUCT IN THREE D THIS IS THE SORT OF THREE D DATA THAT A MACHINE WILL READ
LisaHarouni_2011S WHAT COLOR THAT PRODUCT WILL BE PERHAPS WHAT MATERIAL AND ALSO YOU CAN ENGAGE IN SHAPE MANIPULATION OF THAT PRODUCT BUT WITHIN BOUNDARIES THAT ARE SAFE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE PUBLIC ARE NOT PROFESSIONAL PRODUCT DESIGNERS THE PIECE OF SOFTWARE WILL KEEP AN INDIVIDUAL WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE POSSIBLE
LisaHarouni_2011S AND WHEN SOMEBODY IS READY TO PURCHASE THE PRODUCT IN THEIR PERSONALIZED DESIGN THEY CLICK ENTER AND THIS DATA GETS CONVERTED INTO THE DATA THAT A THREE D PRINTER READS AND GETS PASSED TO A THREE D PRINTER
LisaHarouni_2011S PERHAPS ON SOMEONE 'S DESKTOP
LisaHarouni_2011S HERE 'S THE PRODUCT BEING BUILT
LisaHarouni_2011S YOU CAN SEE THIS CAME OUT OF THE MACHINE IN ONE PIECE AND THE ELECTRONICS WERE INSERTED LATER IT 'S THIS LAMP AS YOU CAN SEE HERE
LisaHarouni_2011S SCANNING TEETH TODAY YOU CAN HAVE YOUR TEETH SCANNED AND DENTAL COATINGS MADE IN THIS WAY TO FIT YOU WHILE YOU WAIT AT THE DENTIST A MACHINE WILL QUIETLY BE CREATING THIS FOR YOU READY TO INSERT IN THE TEETH
LisaHarouni_2011S AND THE IDEA OF NOW CREATING IMPLANTS SCANNING DATA AN MRI SCAN OF SOMEBODY CAN NOW BE CONVERTED INTO THREE D DATA AND WE CAN CREATE VERY SPECIFIC IMPLANTS FOR THEM
LisaHarouni_2011S AND APPLYING THIS TO THE IDEA OF BUILDING UP WHAT 'S IN OUR BODIES YOU KNOW THIS IS PAIR OF LUNGS AND THE BRONCHIAL TREE IT 'S VERY INTRICATE YOU COULDN 'T REALLY CREATE THIS OR SIMULATE IT IN ANY OTHER WAY
LisaHarouni_2011S BUT WITH MRI DATA WE CAN JUST BUILD THE PRODUCT AS YOU CAN SEE VERY INTRICATELY
LisaHarouni_2011S SO JUST TO FINALIZE WE 'RE ALL INDIVIDUAL WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT PREFERENCES DIFFERENT NEEDS WE LIKE DIFFERENT THINGS WE 'RE ALL DIFFERENT SIZES AND OUR COMPANIES THE SAME BUSINESSES WANT DIFFERENT THINGS
