MarlaSpivak_2013G AND THIS IS OUR LIFE WITHOUT BEES
MarlaSpivak_2013G BUT THE IRONIC THING IS THAT BEES ARE NOT OUT THERE POLLINATING OUR FOOD INTENTIONALLY THEY 'RE OUT THERE BECAUSE THEY NEED TO EAT
MarlaSpivak_2013G IN PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE THERE ARE NO BEES OR WHERE THEY PLANT VARIETIES THAT ARE NOT ATTRACTIVE TO BEES PEOPLE ARE PAID TO DO THE BUSINESS OF POLLINATION BY HAND THESE PEOPLE ARE MOVING POLLEN FROM FLOWER TO FLOWER WITH A PAINTBRUSH
MarlaSpivak_2013G NOW THIS BUSINESS OF HAND POLLINATION IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT UNCOMMON TOMATO GROWERS OFTEN POLLINATE THEIR TOMATO FLOWERS WITH A HAND HELD VIBRATOR NOW THIS ONE 'S THE TOMATO TICKLER LAUGHTER NOW THIS IS BECAUSE
MarlaSpivak_2013G THE POLLEN WITHIN A TOMATO FLOWER IS HELD VERY SECURELY WITHIN THE MALE PART OF THE FLOWER THE ANTHER AND THE ONLY WAY TO RELEASE THIS POLLEN IS TO VIBRATE IT
MarlaSpivak_2013G SO BUMBLEBEES ARE ONE OF THE FEW KINDS OF BEES IN THE WORLD THAT ARE ABLE TO HOLD ONTO THE FLOWER AND VIBRATE IT AND THEY DO THIS BY SHAKING THEIR FLIGHT MUSCLES AT A FREQUENCY SIMILAR TO THE MUSICAL NOTE C
MarlaSpivak_2013G SO THEY VIBRATE THE FLOWER THEY SONICATE IT AND THAT RELEASES THE POLLEN IN THIS EFFICIENT SWOOSH AND THE POLLEN GATHERS ALL OVER THE FUZZY BEE 'S BODY AND SHE TAKES IT HOME AS FOOD
MarlaSpivak_2013G TOMATO GROWERS NOW PUT BUMBLEBEE COLONIES INSIDE THE GREENHOUSE TO POLLINATE THE TOMATOES BECAUSE THEY GET MUCH MORE EFFICIENT POLLINATION WHEN IT 'S DONE NATURALLY AND THEY GET BETTER QUALITY TOMATOES
MarlaSpivak_2013G SO
MarlaSpivak_2013G THERE 'S OTHER MAYBE MORE PERSONAL REASONS TO CARE ABOUT BEES THERE 'S OVER TWENTY THOUSAND SPECIES OF BEES IN THE WORLD AND THEY 'RE ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS
MarlaSpivak_2013G THESE BEES SPEND THE MAJORITY OF THEIR LIFE CYCLE HIDDEN IN THE GROUND OR WITHIN A HOLLOW STEM AND VERY FEW OF THESE BEAUTIFUL SPECIES HAVE EVOLVED HIGHLY SOCIAL BEHAVIOR LIKE HONEYBEES
MarlaSpivak_2013G NOW HONEYBEES TEND TO BE THE CHARISMATIC REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE OTHER NINETEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED PLUS SPECIES BECAUSE THERE 'S SOMETHING ABOUT HONEYBEES THAT DRAWS PEOPLE INTO THEIR WORLD
MarlaSpivak_2013G HUMANS HAVE BEEN DRAWN TO HONEYBEES SINCE EARLY RECORDED HISTORY MOSTLY TO HARVEST THEIR HONEY WHICH IS AN AMAZING NATURAL SWEETENER
MarlaSpivak_2013G I GOT DRAWN INTO THE HONEYBEE WORLD COMPLETELY BY A FLUKE I WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD AND BORED AND I PICKED UP A BOOK IN THE LIBRARY ON BEES AND I SPENT THE NIGHT READING IT I HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT INSECTS LIVING IN COMPLEX SOCIETIES IT WAS LIKE THE BEST OF SCIENCE FICTION COME TRUE
MarlaSpivak_2013G AND EVEN STRANGER THERE WERE THESE PEOPLE THESE BEEKEEPERS THAT LOVED THEIR BEES LIKE THEY WERE FAMILY AND WHEN I PUT DOWN THE BOOK I KNEW I HAD TO SEE THIS FOR MYSELF SO I WENT TO WORK FOR A COMMERCIAL BEEKEEPER A FAMILY THAT OWNED TWO THOUSAND HIVES OF BEES IN NEW MEXICO AND I WAS PERMANENTLY HOOKED
MarlaSpivak_2013G HONEYBEES CAN BE CONSIDERED A SUPER ORGANISM WHERE THE COLONY IS THE ORGANISM AND IT 'S COMPRISED OF FORTY THOUSAND TO FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL BEE ORGANISMS
MarlaSpivak_2013G NOW THIS SOCIETY HAS NO CENTRAL AUTHORITY NOBODY 'S IN CHARGE SO HOW THEY COME TO COLLECTIVE DECISIONS AND HOW THEY ALLOCATE THEIR TASKS AND DIVIDE THEIR LABOR HOW THEY COMMUNICATE WHERE THE FLOWERS ARE ALL OF THEIR COLLECTIVE SOCIAL BEHAVIORS ARE MINDBLOWING
MarlaSpivak_2013G MY PERSONAL FAVORITE AND ONE THAT I 'VE STUDIED FOR MANY YEARS IS THEIR SYSTEM OF HEALTHCARE SO BEES HAVE SOCIAL HEALTHCARE
MarlaSpivak_2013G SO IN MY LAB WE STUDY HOW BEES KEEP THEMSELVES HEALTHY FOR EXAMPLE WE STUDY HYGIENE WHERE SOME BEES ARE ABLE TO LOCATE AND WEED OUT SICK INDIVIDUALS FROM THE NEST FROM THE COLONY AND IT KEEPS THE COLONY HEALTHY
MarlaSpivak_2013G AND MORE RECENTLY WE 'VE BEEN STUDYING RESINS THAT BEES COLLECT FROM PLANTS SO BEES FLY TO SOME PLANTS AND THEY SCRAPE THESE VERY VERY STICKY RESINS OFF THE LEAVES AND THEY TAKE THEM BACK TO THE NEST WHERE THEY CEMENT THEM INTO THE NEST ARCHITECTURE WHERE WE CALL IT PROPOLIS
MarlaSpivak_2013G WE 'VE FOUND THAT PROPOLIS IS A NATURAL DISINFECTANT IT 'S A NATURAL ANTIBIOTIC IT KILLS OFF BACTERIA AND MOLDS AND OTHER GERMS WITHIN THE COLONY AND SO IT BOLSTERS THE COLONY HEALTH AND THEIR SOCIAL IMMUNITY
MarlaSpivak_2013G HUMANS HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE POWER OF PROPOLIS SINCE BIBLICAL TIMES WE 'VE BEEN HARVESTING PROPOLIS OUT OF BEE COLONIES
MarlaSpivak_2013G FOR HUMAN MEDICINE BUT WE DIDN 'T KNOW HOW GOOD IT WAS FOR THE BEES
MarlaSpivak_2013G SO HONEYBEES HAVE THESE REMARKABLE NATURAL DEFENSES THAT HAVE KEPT THEM HEALTHY AND THRIVING FOR OVER FIFTY MILLION YEARS
MarlaSpivak_2013G SO SEVEN YEARS AGO WHEN HONEYBEE COLONIES WERE REPORTED TO BE DYING EN MASSE FIRST IN THE UNITED STATES IT WAS CLEAR THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING REALLY REALLY WRONG IN OUR COLLECTIVE CONSCIENCE IN A REALLY PRIMAL WAY WE KNOW WE CAN 'T AFFORD TO LOSE BEES
MarlaSpivak_2013G SO WHAT 'S GOING ON
MarlaSpivak_2013G BEES ARE DYING FROM MULTIPLE AND INTERACTING CAUSES AND I 'LL GO THROUGH EACH OF THESE THE BOTTOM LINE IS BEES DYING REFLECTS A FLOWERLESS LANDSCAPE AND A DYSFUNCTIONAL FOOD SYSTEM
MarlaSpivak_2013G WE HAVE HALF THE NUMBER OF MANAGED HIVES IN THE UNITED STATES NOW COMPARED TO ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE WE 'RE DOWN TO ABOUT TWO MILLION HIVES OF BEES WE THINK AND THE REASON IS AFTER WORLD WAR II WE CHANGED OUR FARMING PRACTICES
MarlaSpivak_2013G WE STOPPED PLANTING COVER CROPS WE STOPPED PLANTING CLOVER AND ALFALFA WHICH ARE NATURAL FERTILIZERS THAT FIX NITROGEN IN THE SOIL AND INSTEAD WE STARTED USING SYNTHETIC FERTILIZERS CLOVER AND ALFALFA ARE HIGHLY NUTRITIOUS FOOD PLANTS FOR BEES
MarlaSpivak_2013G AND AFTER WORLD WAR II WE STARTED USING HERBICIDES TO KILL OFF THE WEEDS IN OUR FARMS MANY OF THESE WEEDS ARE FLOWERING PLANTS THAT BEES REQUIRE FOR THEIR SURVIVAL
MarlaSpivak_2013G AND WE STARTED GROWING LARGER AND LARGER CROP MONOCULTURES NOW WE TALK ABOUT FOOD DESERTS PLACES IN OUR CITIES NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE NO GROCERY STORES
MarlaSpivak_2013G THE VERY FARMS THAT USED TO SUSTAIN BEES ARE NOW AGRICULTURAL FOOD DESERTS DOMINATED BY ONE OR TWO PLANT SPECIES LIKE CORN AND SOYBEANS
MarlaSpivak_2013G SINCE WORLD WAR II WE HAVE BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY ELIMINATING MANY OF THE FLOWERING PLANTS THAT BEES NEED FOR THEIR SURVIVAL
MarlaSpivak_2013G AND THESE MONOCULTURES EXTEND EVEN TO CROPS THAT ARE GOOD FOR BEES LIKE ALMONDS FIFTY YEARS AGO BEEKEEPERS WOULD TAKE A FEW COLONIES HIVES OF BEES INTO THE ALMOND ORCHARDS FOR POLLINATION AND ALSO BECAUSE THE POLLEN IN AN ALMOND BLOSSOM IS REALLY HIGH IN PROTEIN IT 'S REALLY GOOD FOR
MarlaSpivak_2013G AND THEY 'RE TRUCKED IN IN SEMI LOADS AND THEY MUST BE TRUCKED OUT BECAUSE AFTER BLOOM THE ALMOND ORCHARDS ARE A VAST AND FLOWERLESS LANDSCAPE
MarlaSpivak_2013G BEES HAVE BEEN DYING OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS AND WE 'RE PLANTING MORE CROPS THAT NEED THEM THERE HAS BEEN A THREE HUNDRED PERCENT INCREASE IN CROP PRODUCTION THAT REQUIRES BEE POLLINATION
MarlaSpivak_2013G AND THEN THERE 'S PESTICIDES
MarlaSpivak_2013G AFTER WORLD WAR II WE STARTED USING PESTICIDES ON A LARGE SCALE AND THIS BECAME NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE MONOCULTURES THAT PUT OUT A FEAST FOR CROP PESTS
MarlaSpivak_2013G RECENTLY RESEARCHERS FROM PENN STATE UNIVERSITY HAVE STARTED LOOKING AT THE PESTICIDE RESIDUE IN THE LOADS OF POLLEN THAT BEES CARRY HOME AS FOOD AND THEY 'VE FOUND THAT EVERY BATCH OF POLLEN THAT A HONEYBEE COLLECTS HAS AT LEAST SIX DETECTABLE PESTICIDES IN IT
MarlaSpivak_2013G AND THIS INCLUDES EVERY CLASS OF INSECTICIDES HERBICIDES FUNGICIDES AND EVEN INERT AND UNLABELED INGREDIENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE PESTICIDE FORMULATION THAT CAN BE MORE TOXIC THAN THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT
MarlaSpivak_2013G THIS SMALL BEE IS HOLDING UP A LARGE MIRROR HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO TAKE TO CONTAMINATE HUMANS
MarlaSpivak_2013G ONE OF THESE CLASS OF INSECTICIDES THE NEONICONTINOIDS IS MAKING HEADLINES AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT NOW YOU 'VE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT IT THIS IS A NEW CLASS OF INSECTICIDES IT MOVES THROUGH THE PLANT SO THAT A CROP PEST A LEAF EATING INSECT WOULD TAKE A BITE OF THE PLANT AND GET A LETHAL DOSE AND DIE
MarlaSpivak_2013G IF ONE OF THESE NEONICS WE CALL THEM IS APPLIED IN A HIGH CONCENTRATION SUCH AS IN THIS GROUND APPLICATION ENOUGH OF THE COMPOUND MOVES THROUGH THE PLANT AND GETS INTO THE POLLEN AND THE NECTAR WHERE A BEE CAN CONSUME IN THIS CASE A HIGH DOSE OF THIS NEUROTOXIN THAT MAKES THE BEE TWITCH
MarlaSpivak_2013G AND DIE
MarlaSpivak_2013G IN MOST AGRICULTURAL SETTINGS ON MOST OF OUR FARMS IT 'S ONLY THE SEED
MarlaSpivak_2013G AND ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE BEES HAVE THEIR OWN SET OF DISEASES AND PARASITES PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE FOR BEES IS THIS THING IT 'S CALLED VARROA DESTRUCTOR IT 'S APTLY NAMED IT 'S THIS BIG BLOOD SUCKING PARASITE THAT COMPROMISES THE BEE 'S IMMUNE SYSTEM AND CIRCULATES VIRUSES
MarlaSpivak_2013G LET ME PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER FOR YOU
MarlaSpivak_2013G I DON 'T KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO A BEE TO HAVE A BIG BLOODSUCKING PARASITE RUNNING AROUND ON IT AND I DON 'T KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO A BEE TO HAVE A VIRUS BUT I DO KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN I HAVE A VIRUS THE FLU AND I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR ME TO GET TO THE GROCERY STORE TO GET GOOD NUTRITION
MarlaSpivak_2013G BUT WHAT IF I LIVED IN A FOOD DESERT
MarlaSpivak_2013G AND WHAT IF I HAD TO TRAVEL A LONG DISTANCE TO GET TO THE GROCERY STORE AND I FINALLY GOT MY WEAK BODY OUT THERE AND I CONSUMED IN MY FOOD ENOUGH OF A PESTICIDE A NEUROTOXIN THAT I COULDN 'T FIND MY WAY HOME
MarlaSpivak_2013G AND THIS IS WHAT WE MEAN BY MULTIPLE AND INTERACTING CAUSES OF DEATH
MarlaSpivak_2013G SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
MarlaSpivak_2013G WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS BIG BEE BUMMER THAT WE 'VE CREATED IT TURNS OUT IT 'S HOPEFUL IT 'S HOPEFUL
MarlaSpivak_2013G EVERY ONE OF YOU OUT THERE CAN HELP BEES IN TWO VERY DIRECT AND EASY WAYS PLANT BEE FRIENDLY FLOWERS
MarlaSpivak_2013G AND DON 'T CONTAMINATE THESE FLOWERS THIS BEE FOOD WITH PESTICIDES
MarlaSpivak_2013G SO GO ONLINE AND SEARCH FOR FLOWERS THAT ARE NATIVE TO YOUR AREA AND PLANT THEM PLANT THEM IN A POT ON YOUR DOORSTEP PLANT THEM IN YOUR FRONT YARD IN YOUR LAWNS IN YOUR BOULEVARDS CAMPAIGN TO HAVE THEM PLANTED IN PUBLIC GARDENS
MarlaSpivak_2013G COMMUNITY SPACES MEADOWS SET ASIDE FARMLAND WE NEED A BEAUTIFUL DIVERSITY OF FLOWERS THAT BLOOMS OVER THE ENTIRE GROWING SEASON FROM SPRING TO FALL WE NEED ROADSIDES SEEDED IN FLOWERS FOR OUR BEES BUT ALSO FOR MIGRATING BUTTERFLIES AND BIRDS AND OTHER WILDLIFE
MarlaSpivak_2013G AND WE NEED TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT PUTTING BACK IN COVER CROPS TO NOURISH OUR SOIL AND NOURISH OUR BEES
MarlaSpivak_2013G AND WE NEED TO DIVERSIFY OUR FARMS WE NEED TO PLANT FLOWERING CROP BORDERS AND HEDGE ROWS TO DISRUPT THE AGRICULTURAL FOOD DESERT AND BEGIN TO CORRECT THE DYSFUNCTIONAL FOOD SYSTEM THAT WE 'VE CREATED
MarlaSpivak_2013G SO MAYBE IT SEEMS LIKE A REALLY SMALL COUNTERMEASURE TO A BIG HUGE PROBLEM JUST GO PLANT FLOWERS BUT WHEN BEES HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD NUTRITION WE HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD NUTRITION THROUGH THEIR POLLINATION SERVICES
MarlaSpivak_2013G AND WHEN BEES HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD NUTRITION THEY 'RE BETTER ABLE TO ENGAGE THEIR OWN NATURAL DEFENSES THEIR HEALTHCARE THAT THEY HAVE RELIED ON FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS
MarlaSpivak_2013G SO THE BEAUTY OF HELPING BEES THIS WAY FOR ME IS THAT
MarlaSpivak_2013G EVERY ONE OF US NEEDS TO BEHAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE A BEE SOCIETY AN INSECT SOCIETY
MarlaSpivak_2013G WHERE EACH OF OUR INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A GRAND SOLUTION AN EMERGENT PROPERTY THAT 'S MUCH GREATER THAN THE MERE SUM OF OUR INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS
MarlaSpivak_2013G SO LET THE SMALL ACT OF PLANTING FLOWERS AND KEEPING THEM FREE OF PESTICIDES BE THE DRIVER OF LARGE SCALE CHANGE
MarlaSpivak_2013G ON BEHALF OF THE BEES THANK YOU
MarlaSpivak_2013G THIS MARIA SPIVAK YEAH AT LEAST IN THE UNITED STATES AN AVERAGE OF THIRTY PERCENT OF ALL BEE HIVES ARE LOST EVERY WINTER ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO WE WERE AT A FIFTEEN PERCENT LOSS SO
MarlaSpivak_2013G IT 'S GETTING PRECARIOUS AND SO THEY CAN MAINTAIN THE SAME NUMBER THEY CAN RECUPERATE SOME OF THEIR LOSS WE 'RE KIND OF AT A TIPPING POINT WE CAN 'T REALLY AFFORD TO LOSE THAT MANY MORE
MarlaSpivak_2013G WE NEED TO BE REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF ALL THE BEEKEEPERS OUT THERE
