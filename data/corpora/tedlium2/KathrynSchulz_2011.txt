KathrynSchulz_2011 AND A FRIEND AND I GO ON A ROAD TRIP FROM PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND TO PORTLAND OREGON
KathrynSchulz_2011 SO WE DO THE WHOLE THING ON BACK ROADS THROUGH STATE PARKS AND NATIONAL FORESTS BASICALLY THE LONGEST ROUTE WE CAN POSSIBLY TAKE
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOUTH DAKOTA
KathrynSchulz_2011 I TURN TO MY FRIEND
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND I ASK HER A QUESTION THAT 'S BEEN BOTHERING ME FOR TWO THOUSAND MILES
KathrynSchulz_2011 WHAT 'S UP WITH THE CHINESE CHARACTER I KEEP SEEING BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
KathrynSchulz_2011 MY FRIEND LOOKS AT ME TOTALLY BLANKLY
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND THEN SHE CRACKS UP
KathrynSchulz_2011 BECAUSE SHE FIGURES OUT WHAT I 'M TALKING ABOUT
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND WHAT I 'M TALKING ABOUT IS THIS
KathrynSchulz_2011 THINKING ABOUT SITUATIONS EXACTLY LIKE THIS
KathrynSchulz_2011 WHY WE SOMETIMES MISUNDERSTAND THE SIGNS AROUND US
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND HOW WE BEHAVE WHEN THAT HAPPENS AND WHAT ALL OF THIS CAN TELL US ABOUT HUMAN NATURE IN OTHER WORDS AS YOU HEARD CHRIS SAY
KathrynSchulz_2011 THIS MIGHT STRIKE YOU AS A STRANGE CAREER MOVE
KathrynSchulz_2011 BUT IT ACTUALLY HAS ONE GREAT ADVANTAGE
KathrynSchulz_2011 NO JOB COMPETITION
KathrynSchulz_2011 OR AT LEAST TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE OURSELVES ARE WRONG
KathrynSchulz_2011 WE ALL KNOW EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM MAKES MISTAKES THE HUMAN SPECIES IN GENERAL IS FALLIBLE OKAY FINE
KathrynSchulz_2011 BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO ME RIGHT NOW
KathrynSchulz_2011 TO ALL THE BELIEFS I HOLD HERE IN THE PRESENT TENSE
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND THE THING IS THE PRESENT TENSE IS WHERE WE LIVE WE GO TO MEETINGS IN THE PRESENT TENSE WE GO ON FAMILY VACATIONS IN THE PRESENT TENSE WE GO TO THE POLLS AND VOTE IN THE PRESENT TENSE SO EFFECTIVELY WE ALL KIND OF WIND UP TRAVELING THROUGH LIFE TRAPPED IN THIS LITTLE BUBBLE OF FEELING VERY RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING
KathrynSchulz_2011 I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM
KathrynSchulz_2011 I THINK IT 'S A PROBLEM FOR EACH OF US AS INDIVIDUALS IN OUR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIVES
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND I THINK IT 'S A PROBLEM FOR ALL OF US COLLECTIVELY AS A CULTURE
KathrynSchulz_2011 SO WHAT I WANT TO DO TODAY IS FIRST OF ALL TALK ABOUT WHY WE GET STUCK INSIDE THIS FEELING OF BEING RIGHT
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND SECOND WHY IT 'S SUCH A PROBLEM
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND FINALLY I WANT TO CONVINCE YOU THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO STEP OUTSIDE OF THAT FEELING
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND THAT IF YOU CAN DO SO IT IS THE SINGLE GREATEST MORAL INTELLECTUAL AND CREATIVE LEAP YOU CAN MAKE SO
KathrynSchulz_2011 ONE REASON ACTUALLY HAS TO DO WITH A FEELING OF BEING WRONG
KathrynSchulz_2011 THANK YOU THESE ARE GREAT ANSWERS
KathrynSchulz_2011 BUT THEY 'RE ANSWERS TO A DIFFERENT QUESTION
KathrynSchulz_2011 YOU GUYS ARE ANSWERING THE QUESTION HOW DOES IT FEEL TO REALIZE YOU 'RE WRONG
KathrynSchulz_2011 IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY EPISODE OF THIS CARTOON THERE 'S A MOMENT WHERE THE COYOTE IS CHASING THE ROADRUNNER AND THE ROADRUNNER RUNS OFF A CLIFF
KathrynSchulz_2011 WHICH IS FINE HE 'S A BIRD HE CAN FLY
KathrynSchulz_2011 BUT THE THING IS THE COYOTE RUNS OFF THE CLIFF RIGHT AFTER HIM AND WHAT 'S FUNNY AT LEAST IF YOU 'RE SIX YEARS OLD IS THAT THE COYOTE 'S TOTALLY FINE TOO HE JUST KEEPS RUNNING RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT THAT HE LOOKS DOWN AND REALIZES THAT HE 'S IN MID AIR
KathrynSchulz_2011 THAT 'S WHEN HE FALLS
KathrynSchulz_2011 WE 'RE LIKE THAT COYOTE
KathrynSchulz_2011 AFTER HE 'S GONE OFF THE CLIFF AND BEFORE HE LOOKS DOWN
KathrynSchulz_2011 YOU KNOW WE 'RE ALREADY WRONG
KathrynSchulz_2011 SO I SHOULD ACTUALLY CORRECT SOMETHING I SAID A MOMENT AGO
KathrynSchulz_2011 IT DOES FEEL LIKE SOMETHING TO BE WRONG
KathrynSchulz_2011 THINK BACK FOR A MOMENT TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
KathrynSchulz_2011 SO BY THE TIME YOU ARE NINE YEARS OLD
KathrynSchulz_2011 YOU 'VE ALREADY LEARNED FIRST OF ALL THAT PEOPLE WHO GET STUFF WRONG ARE LAZY IRRESPONSIBLE DIMWITS
KathrynSchulz_2011 IS TO NEVER MAKE ANY MISTAKES
KathrynSchulz_2011 WE LEARN THESE REALLY BAD LESSONS REALLY WELL
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND A LOT OF US AND I SUSPECT ESPECIALLY A LOT OF US IN THIS ROOM
KathrynSchulz_2011 DEAL WITH THEM BY JUST BECOMING PERFECT LITTLE A STUDENTS
KathrynSchulz_2011 AT THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE 'VE GOTTEN SOMETHING WRONG
KathrynSchulz_2011 BECAUSE IT MAKES US FEEL SMART AND RESPONSIBLE AND VIRTUOUS AND SAFE
KathrynSchulz_2011 SO THIS WOMAN COMES IN
KathrynSchulz_2011 WHY IS THE WRONG SIDE OF MY BODY IN BANDAGES
KathrynSchulz_2011 WELL THE WRONG SIDE OF HER BODY IS IN BANDAGES BECAUSE THE SURGEON HAS PERFORMED A MAJOR OPERATION ON HER LEFT LEG INSTEAD OF HER RIGHT ONE
KathrynSchulz_2011 WHEN THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY AT BETH ISRAEL SPOKE ABOUT THIS INCIDENT
KathrynSchulz_2011 HE SAID SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING
KathrynSchulz_2011 THE POINT OF THIS STORY
KathrynSchulz_2011 IS THAT TRUSTING TOO MUCH IN THE FEELING OF BEING ON THE CORRECT SIDE
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND WHEN WE ACT LIKE IT IS AND WE STOP ENTERTAINING THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE COULD BE WRONG
KathrynSchulz_2011 OR TORPEDOING THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
KathrynSchulz_2011 SO THIS IS A HUGE PRACTICAL PROBLEM
KathrynSchulz_2011 BUT IT 'S ALSO A HUGE SOCIAL PROBLEM
KathrynSchulz_2011 THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO FEEL RIGHT
KathrynSchulz_2011 IT MEANS THAT YOU THINK THAT YOUR BELIEFS JUST PERFECTLY REFLECT REALITY
KathrynSchulz_2011 IT TURNS OUT MOST OF US EXPLAIN THOSE PEOPLE THE SAME WAY
KathrynSchulz_2011 WHEN IT TURNS OUT THOSE PEOPLE HAVE ALL THE SAME FACTS THAT WE DO AND THEY STILL DISAGREE WITH US
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND WHEN THAT DOESN 'T WORK WHEN IT TURNS OUT THAT PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH US
KathrynSchulz_2011 HAVE ALL THE SAME FACTS WE DO
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY SMART
KathrynSchulz_2011 SO THIS IS A CATASTROPHE THIS ATTACHMENT TO OUR OWN RIGHTNESS
KathrynSchulz_2011 KEEPS US FROM PREVENTING MISTAKES WHEN WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO AND CAUSES US TO TREAT EACH OTHER TERRIBLY
KathrynSchulz_2011 BUT TO ME WHAT 'S MOST BAFFLING AND MOST TRAGIC ABOUT THIS
KathrynSchulz_2011 IS THAT IT MISSES THE WHOLE POINT OF BEING HUMAN IT 'S LIKE WE WANT TO IMAGINE THAT OUR MINDS ARE JUST THESE PERFECTLY TRANSLUCENT WINDOWS AND WE JUST GAZE OUT OF THEM AND DESCRIBE THE WORLD AS IT UNFOLDS
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND WE WANT EVERYBODY ELSE TO GAZE OUT OF THE SAME WINDOW AND SEE THE EXACT SAME THING
KathrynSchulz_2011 THAT IS NOT TRUE AND IF IT WERE LIFE WOULD BE INCREDIBLY BORING
KathrynSchulz_2011 THE MIRACLE OF YOUR MIND
KathrynSchulz_2011 ISN 'T THAT YOU CAN SEE THE WORLD AS IT IS
KathrynSchulz_2011 IT 'S THAT YOU CAN SEE THE WORLD AS IT ISN 'T
KathrynSchulz_2011 WE CAN REMEMBER THE PAST
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND WE CAN IMAGINE WHAT IT 'S LIKE TO BE SOME OTHER PERSON IN SOME OTHER PLACE
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND WE ALL DO THIS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND ALSO THIS AND ALSO THIS AND YEAH IT IS ALSO WHY WE GET THINGS WRONG
KathrynSchulz_2011 I ERR THEREFORE I AM
KathrynSchulz_2011 AUGUSTINE UNDERSTOOD THAT OUR CAPACITY TO SCREW UP IT 'S NOT SOME KIND OF EMBARRASSING DEFECT IN THE HUMAN SYSTEM
KathrynSchulz_2011 SOMETHING WE CAN ERADICATE OR OVERCOME
KathrynSchulz_2011 IT 'S TOTALLY FUNDAMENTAL TO WHO WE ARE
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND UNLIKE ALL OF THE OTHER ANIMALS
KathrynSchulz_2011 WE ARE OBSESSED WITH TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT
KathrynSchulz_2011 TO ME THIS OBSESSION
KathrynSchulz_2011 IS THE SOURCE AND ROOT OF ALL OF OUR PRODUCTIVITY AND CREATIVITY
KathrynSchulz_2011 ALL THE STORIES ARE ABOUT BEING WRONG
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND THE CRYPTO THEME IS I THOUGHT THIS ONE THING WAS GOING TO
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED INSTEAD
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND THE THING IS SAYS IRA GLASS
KathrynSchulz_2011 WE NEED THIS WE NEED THESE MOMENTS OF SURPRISE AND REVERSAL AND WRONGNESS TO MAKE THESE STORIES WORK
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND FOR THE REST OF US AUDIENCE MEMBERS AS LISTENERS AS READERS
KathrynSchulz_2011 WE EAT THIS STUFF UP
KathrynSchulz_2011 WE LOVE THINGS LIKE PLOT TWISTS AND RED HERRINGS AND SURPRISE ENDINGS
KathrynSchulz_2011 WHEN IT COMES TO OUR STORIES
KathrynSchulz_2011 WE THINK THIS ONE THING IS GOING TO HAPPEN
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS INSTEAD
KathrynSchulz_2011 GEORGE BUSH THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO INVADE IRAQ FIND A BUNCH OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION LIBERATE THE PEOPLE AND BRING DEMOCRACY TO THE MIDDLE EAST
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED INSTEAD
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND HOSNI MUBARAK THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BE THE DICTATOR OF EGYPT FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE UNTIL HE GOT TOO OLD OR TOO SICK AND COULD PASS THE REIGNS OF POWER ONTO HIS SON
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED INSTEAD
KathrynSchulz_2011 GROW UP AND MARRY YOUR HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART AND MOVE BACK TO YOUR HOMETOWN AND RAISE A BUNCH OF KIDS TOGETHER
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED INSTEAD
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT
KathrynSchulz_2011 I THOUGHT I WAS WRITING AN INCREDIBLY NERDY BOOK ABOUT A SUBJECT EVERYBODY HATES FOR AN AUDIENCE THAT WOULD NEVER MATERIALIZE
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED INSTEAD
KathrynSchulz_2011 WE GENERATE THESE INCREDIBLE STORIES ABOUT THE WORLD AROUND US
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND THEN THE WORLD TURNS AROUND AND ASTONISHES US
KathrynSchulz_2011 NO OFFENSE BUT THIS ENTIRE CONFERENCE IS AN UNBELIEVABLE MONUMENT TO OUR CAPACITY TO GET STUFF WRONG
KathrynSchulz_2011 WE JUST SPENT AN ENTIRE WEEK TALKING ABOUT INNOVATIONS AND ADVANCEMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS BUT YOU KNOW WHY WE NEED
KathrynSchulz_2011 BOGGLING AND WORLD ALTERING TED ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT
KathrynSchulz_2011 WE TELL ANOTHER STORY WE HOLD ANOTHER CONFERENCE
KathrynSchulz_2011 THE THEME OF THIS ONE AS YOU GUYS HAVE NOW HEARD SEVEN MILLION TIMES IS THE REDISCOVERY OF WONDER
KathrynSchulz_2011 YOU NEED TO STEP OUTSIDE OF THAT TINY TERRIFIED SPACE OF RIGHTNESS
KathrynSchulz_2011 AND LOOK AROUND AT EACH OTHER
