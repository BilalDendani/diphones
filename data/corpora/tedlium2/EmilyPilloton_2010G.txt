EmilyPilloton_2010G THIS IS A STORY OF A PLACE THAT I NOW CALL HOME IT'S A STORY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION
EmilyPilloton_2010G AND OF RURAL COMMUNITIES AND OF WHAT DESIGN MIGHT DO TO IMPROVE BOTH SO THIS IS BERTIE COUNTY NORTH CAROLINA USA
EmilyPilloton_2010G ABOUT TWO HOURS EAST DRIVING TIME FROM RALEIGH AND IT'S VERY FLAT IT'S VERY SWAMPY IT'S MOSTLY FARMLAND
EmilyPilloton_2010G THE ENTIRE COUNTY IS HOME TO JUST TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THEY'RE VERY SPARSELY DISTRIBUTED SO THERE'S ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PEOPLE PER SQUARE MILE WHICH COMES DOWN TO ABOUT TEN PEOPLE PER SQUARE KILOMETER
EmilyPilloton_2010G BERTIE COUNTY IS KIND OF A PRIME EXAMPLE IN THE DEMISE OF RURAL AMERICA WE'VE SEEN THIS STORY ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
EmilyPilloton_2010G AND EVEN IN PLACES BEYOND THE AMERICAN BORDERS WE KNOW THE SYMPTOMS IT'S THE HOLLOWING OUT OF SMALL TOWNS IT'S DOWNTOWNS BECOMING GHOST TOWNS
EmilyPilloton_2010G THE BRAIN DRAIN WHERE ALL OF THE MOST EDUCATED AND QUALIFIED LEAVE AND NEVER COME BACK IT'S THE DEPENDENCE ON FARM SUBSIDIES AND UNDER PERFORMING SCHOOLS AND HIGHER POVERTY RATES IN RURAL AREAS THAN IN URBAN
EmilyPilloton_2010G AND BERTIE COUNTY IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS PERHAPS THE BIGGEST THING IT STRUGGLES WITH LIKE MANY COMMUNITIES SIMILAR TO IT IS THAT THERE'S NO
EmilyPilloton_2010G SHARED COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE OF RURAL COMMUNITIES ONLY SIX POINT EIGHT PERCENT OF ALL OUR PHILANTHROPIC GIVING IN THE U S RIGHT NOW
EmilyPilloton_2010G HAS ONE IN THREE OF ITS CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY AND IT'S WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS A RURAL GHETTO THE ECONOMY IS MOSTLY AGRICULTURAL THE BIGGEST CROPS ARE COTTON AND TOBACCO AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF OUR BERTIE COUNTY PEANUT
EmilyPilloton_2010G IT'S HOME TO ONLY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE AND LIKE A LOT OF OTHER SMALL TOWNS IT HAS BEEN HOLLOWED OUT OVER THE YEARS THERE ARE MORE BUILDINGS THAT ARE EMPTY OR IN DISREPAIR THAN OCCUPIED AND IN USE
EmilyPilloton_2010G YOU CAN COUNT THE NUMBER OF RESTAURANTS IN THE COUNTY ON ONE HAND BUNN 'S BARBECUE BEING MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE BUT IN THE WHOLE COUNTY THERE IS NO COFFEE SHOP THERE'S NO INTERNET CAFE THERE'S NO MOVIE THEATER THERE'S NO BOOKSTORE THERE ISN'T EVEN
EmilyPilloton_2010G SO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE ABOUT EIGHTY SIX PERCENT AFRICAN AMERICAN AND THIS IS A SPREAD FROM THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER OF THE RECENT GRADUATING CLASS AND YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IS PRETTY STARK
EmilyPilloton_2010G SO TO SAY THAT THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IN BERTIE COUNTY IS STRUGGLING WOULD BE A HUGE UNDERSTATEMENT THERE'S BASICALLY NO POOL OF QUALIFIED TEACHERS TO PULL FROM
EmilyPilloton_2010G AND ONLY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY HAVE A BACHELOR 'S DEGREE OR HIGHER SO THERE ISN'T A BIG LEGACY IN THE PRIDE OF EDUCATION
EmilyPilloton_2010G IN FACT TWO YEARS AGO ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF ALL THE THIRD THROUGH EIGHTH GRADERS WERE PASSING THE STATE STANDARD IN BOTH ENGLISH AND MATH
EmilyPilloton_2010G SO IT SOUNDS LIKE I'M PAINTING A REALLY BLEAK PICTURE OF THIS PLACE BUT I PROMISE THERE IS GOOD NEWS THE BIGGEST ASSET IN MY OPINION ONE OF THE BIGGEST ASSETS IN BERTIE COUNTY RIGHT NOW IS THIS MAN THIS IS DOCTOR CHIP ZULLINGER FONDLY KNOWN AS DOCTOR Z
EmilyPilloton_2010G IN IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AS THE NEW SUPERINTENDENT TO BASICALLY FIX THIS BROKEN SCHOOL SYSTEM AND HE PREVIOUSLY WAS A SUPERINTENDENT IN CHARLESTON SOUTH CAROLINA AND THEN IN DENVER COLORADO HE STARTED SOME OF THE COUNTRY 'S FIRST CHARTER SCHOOLS
EmilyPilloton_2010G IN THE LATE EIGHTIES IN THE U S AND HE IS AN ABSOLUTE RENEGADE AND A VISIONARY AND HE IS THE REASON THAT I NOW LIVE AND WORK THERE
EmilyPilloton_2010G SO IN FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINE DOCTOR ZULLINGER INVITED US PROJECT H DESIGN WHICH IS A NON PROFIT DESIGN FIRM THAT I FOUNDED
EmilyPilloton_2010G TO COME COME TO BERTIE AND TO PARTNER WITH HIM ON THE REPAIR OF THIS SCHOOL DISTRICT AND TO BRING A DESIGN PERSPECTIVE TO THE REPAIR OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT
EmilyPilloton_2010G AND HE INVITED US IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC TYPE OF DESIGN PROCESS ONE THAT RESULTS IN APPROPRIATE DESIGN SOLUTIONS IN PLACES THAT DON'T USUALLY HAVE ACCESS TO DESIGN SERVICES OR CREATIVE CAPITAL
EmilyPilloton_2010G SO AT THE TIME OF BEING INVITED DOWN THERE WE WERE BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO AND SO WE WERE GOING BACK AND FORTH FOR BASICALLY THE REST OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINE
EmilyPilloton_2010G SO FAST FORWARD TO TODAY AND WE NOW LIVE THERE I HAVE STRATEGICALLY CUT MATT 'S HEAD OUT OF THIS PHOTO BECAUSE HE WOULD KILL ME IF HE KNEW I WAS USING IT BECAUSE OF THE SWEATSUITS BUT
EmilyPilloton_2010G THIS IS OUR FRONT PORCH WE LIVE THERE WE NOW CALL THIS PLACE HOME OVER THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR THAT WE SPENT FLYING BACK AND FORTH WE REALIZED WE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE PLACE WE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH
EmilyPilloton_2010G THE PLACE AND THE PEOPLE AND THE WORK THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO IN A RURAL PLACE LIKE BERTIE COUNTY THAT AS DESIGNERS AND BUILDERS YOU CAN'T DO EVERYWHERE
EmilyPilloton_2010G THERE'S SPACE TO EXPERIMENT AND TO WELD AND TO TEST THINGS WE HAVE AN AMAZING ADVOCATE IN DOCTOR ZULLINGER THERE'S A NOBILITY OF REAL HANDS ON DIRT UNDER YOUR FINGERNAILS WORK
EmilyPilloton_2010G AND SO WE SAW AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING DESIGN AS THIS UNTOUCHED TOOL SOMETHING THAT BERTIE COUNTY DIDN'T OTHERWISE HAVE AND TO BE SORT OF THE TO USHER THAT IN AS A NEW TYPE OF TOOL IN THEIR TOOL KIT
EmilyPilloton_2010G THE INITIAL GOAL BECAME USING DESIGN WITHIN THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DOCTOR ZULLINGER THAT WAS WHY WE WERE THERE BUT BEYOND THAT WE RECOGNIZED THAT BERTIE COUNTY
EmilyPilloton_2010G AS A COMMUNITY WAS IN DIRE NEED OF A FRESH PERSPECTIVE OF PRIDE AND CONNECTEDNESS AND OF THE CREATIVE CAPITAL THAT THEY WERE SO MUCH LACKING
EmilyPilloton_2010G SO THE GOAL BECAME YES TO APPLY DESIGN WITHIN EDUCATION BUT THEN TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE EDUCATION A GREAT VEHICLE FOR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
EmilyPilloton_2010G SO IN ORDER TO DO THIS WE'VE TAKEN THREE DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THE INTERSECTION OF DESIGN AND EDUCATION
EmilyPilloton_2010G I SHOULD SAY THAT THESE ARE THREE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IN BERTIE COUNTY BUT I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THEY COULD WORK IN A LOT OF OTHER RURAL COMMUNITIES AROUND THE U S AND MAYBE EVEN BEYOND
EmilyPilloton_2010G SO THE FIRST OF THE THREE IS DESIGN FOR EDUCATION THIS IS THE MOST KIND OF DIRECT OBVIOUS INTERSECTION OF THE TWO THINGS
EmilyPilloton_2010G IT'S THE PHYSICAL CONSTRUCTION OF IMPROVED SPACES AND MATERIALS AND EXPERIENCES FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO
EmilyPilloton_2010G THE AWFUL MOBILE TRAILERS AND THE OUTDATED TEXTBOOKS AND THE TERRIBLE MATERIALS THAT WE'RE BUILDING SCHOOLS OUT OF THESE
EmilyPilloton_2010G SO WE WANTED TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT STUDENTS APPROACH TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE A MORE CONVIVIAL AND SOCIAL SPACE THAT WAS MORE ENGAGING MORE ACCESSIBLE
EmilyPilloton_2010G AND IN MATCH ME YOU TAKE THE CLASS DIVIDE IT INTO TWO TEAMS ONE TEAM ON EACH SIDE OF THE PLAYGROUND AND THE TEACHER WILL TAKE PIECE OF CHALK AND JUST WRITE A NUMBER ON EACH OF THE TIRES
EmilyPilloton_2010G TO FIGURE OUT THAT FOUR TIMES FOUR IS SIXTEEN AND FIND THE TIRE WITH THE SIXTEEN ON IT AND SIT ON IT SO THE GOAL IS TO HAVE ALL OF YOUR TEAMMATES SITTING ON THE TIRES AND THEN YOUR TEAM WINS
EmilyPilloton_2010G THE IMPACT OF THE LEARNING LANDSCAPE HAS BEEN PRETTY SURPRISING AND AMAZING SOME OF THE CLASSES AND TEACHERS HAVE REPORTED HIGHER TEST SCORES A GREATER COMFORT LEVEL WITH THE MATERIAL ESPECIALLY WITH THE BOYS THAT IN GOING OUTSIDE AND PLAYING THEY AREN'T AFRAID TO TAKE ON A DOUBLE DIGIT
EmilyPilloton_2010G THIS IS MISTER PERRY HE 'S THE ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT HE CAME OUT FOR ONE OF OUR TEACHER TRAINING DAYS AND WON LIKE FIVE ROUNDS OF MATCH ME IN A ROW AND WAS VERY PROUD OF
EmilyPilloton_2010G THE SECOND APPROACH IS REDESIGNING EDUCATION ITSELF THIS IS THE MOST COMPLEX IT'S A SYSTEMS LEVEL LOOK AT HOW EDUCATION IS ADMINISTERED
EmilyPilloton_2010G AND WHAT IS BEING OFFERED AND TO WHOM SO IN MANY CASES THIS IS NOT SO MUCH ABOUT MAKING CHANGE AS IT IS CREATING THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH CHANGE IS POSSIBLE
EmilyPilloton_2010G AND THE INCENTIVE TO WANT TO MAKE CHANGE WHICH IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND IN INSIDE THE BOX EDUCATION SYSTEMS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES
EmilyPilloton_2010G SO FOR US THIS WAS A GRAPHIC PUBLIC CAMPAIGN CALLED CONNECT BERTIE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THESE BLUE DOTS ALL OVER THE COUNTY
EmilyPilloton_2010G THIS WAS FOR A FUND THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAD TO PUT A DESKTOP COMPUTER AND A BROADBAND INTERNET CONNECTION IN EVERY HOME WITH A CHILD IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM
EmilyPilloton_2010G ASIDE FROM YOU KNOW GETTING PEOPLE EXCITED AND WONDERING WHAT THE HECK THESE BLUE DOTS WERE ALL OVER THE PLACE IT ASKED THE SCHOOL SYSTEM
EmilyPilloton_2010G TO ENVISION HOW IT MIGHT BECOME A CATALYST FOR A MORE CONNECTED COMMUNITY IT ASKED THEM TO REACH OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL WALLS AND TO THINK ABOUT HOW THEY COULD PLAY A ROLE IN THE COMMUNITY 'S DEVELOPMENT
EmilyPilloton_2010G SO THE FIRST BATCH OF COMPUTERS ARE BEING INSTALLED LATER THIS SUMMER AND WE'RE HELPING DOCTOR ZULLINGER DEVELOP SOME STRATEGIES AROUND HOW WE MIGHT CONNECT THE CLASSROOM
EmilyPilloton_2010G AND THE HOME TO EXTEND LEARNING BEYOND THE SCHOOL DAY AND THEN THE THIRD APPROACH WHICH IS WHAT I'M MOST EXCITED ABOUT WHICH IS WHERE WE ARE NOW
EmilyPilloton_2010G DESIGN AS EDUCATION SO DESIGN AS EDUCATION MEANS THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY TEACH DESIGN WITHIN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND NOT DESIGN BASED LEARNING NOT LIKE
EmilyPilloton_2010G LET 'S LEARN PHYSICS BY BUILDING A ROCKET BUT ACTUALLY LEARNING DESIGN THINKING COUPLED WITH REAL CONSTRUCTION AND FABRICATION SKILLS PUT TOWARDS A LOCAL COMMUNITY PURPOSE
EmilyPilloton_2010G ANTIDOTE TO ALL OF THE BORING RIGID VERBAL INSTRUCTION THAT SO MANY OF THESE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE PLAGUED BY IT'S HANDS ON
EmilyPilloton_2010G IT'S A VOCATIONAL TRAINING PATH IT'S WORKING CLASS IT'S BLUE COLLAR THE PROJECTS ARE THINGS LIKE LET 'S MAKE A BIRDHOUSE FOR YOUR MOM FOR CHRISTMAS AND IN RECENT DECADES A LOT OF THE FUNDING FOR SHOP CLASS HAS GONE AWAY ENTIRELY
EmilyPilloton_2010G SO WE THOUGHT WHAT IF YOU COULD BRING BACK SHOP CLASS BUT THIS TIME ORIENT THE PROJECTS AROUND THINGS THAT THE COMMUNITY NEEDED AND TO INFUSE SHOP CLASS WITH MORE CRITICAL AND CREATIVE DESIGN THINKING STUDIO PROCESS
EmilyPilloton_2010G TO THE JUNIOR CLASS AND SO THIS STARTS IN FOUR WEEKS AT THE END OF THE SUMMER AND MY PARTNER AND I MATTHEW AND I JUST WENT THROUGH THE ARDUOUS AND TOTALLY CONVOLUTED PROCESS OF GETTING CERTIFIED AS HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS TO ACTUALLY RUN IT
EmilyPilloton_2010G AND THEN MOVING INTO THE SHOP AND ACTUALLY TESTING THEM BUILDING THEM PROTOTYPING THEM FIGURING OUT IF THEY ARE GOING TO WORK AND REFINING THAT
EmilyPilloton_2010G IS AN OPEN AIR FARMERS MARKET DOWNTOWN FOLLOWED BY BUS SHELTERS FOR THE SCHOOL BUS SYSTEM IN THE SECOND YEAR AND HOME IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE ELDERLY IN THE THIRD YEAR
EmilyPilloton_2010G WHERE SHE CALLS HOME AND SHE FEELS VERY STRONGLY ABOUT GIVING BACK TO THIS PLACE THAT SHE'S BEEN FAIRLY FORTUNATE IN SO WHAT STUDIO H MIGHT OFFER HER IS A WAY TO DEVELOP SKILLS SO THAT SHE MIGHT GIVE BACK IN THE MOST MEANINGFUL WAY
EmilyPilloton_2010G THIS IS ERIC HE PLAYS FOR THE FOOTBALL TEAM HE IS REALLY INTO DIRTBIKE RACING AND HE WANTS TO BE AN ARCHITECT
EmilyPilloton_2010G SO FOR HIM STUDIO H OFFERS HIM A WAY TO DEVELOP THE SKILLS HE WILL NEED AS AN ARCHITECT EVERYTHING FROM DRAFTING TO WOOD AND METAL CONSTRUCTION TO HOW TO DO RESEARCH FOR A CLIENT
EmilyPilloton_2010G HANDS ON ENGAGEMENT HE 'S INTERESTED IN FORESTRY BUT HE ISN'T SURE SO IF HE ENDS UP NOT GOING TO COLLEGE HE WILL HAVE DEVELOPED SOME INDUSTRY RELEVANT SKILLS
EmilyPilloton_2010G WHAT DESIGN AND BUILDING REALLY OFFERS TO PUBLIC EDUCATION IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF CLASSROOM SO THIS BUILDING DOWNTOWN WHICH MAY VERY WELL BECOME THE SITE OF OUR FUTURE FARMERS MARKET IS NOW THE CLASSROOM
EmilyPilloton_2010G AND GOING OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND INTERVIEWING YOUR NEIGHBORS ABOUT WHAT KIND OF FOOD THEY BUY AND FROM WHERE AND WHY THAT'S A HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT
EmilyPilloton_2010G AND THE RIBBON CUTTING CEREMONY AT THE END OF THE SUMMER WHEN THEY HAVE BUILT THE FARMERS MARKET AND IT'S OPEN TO THE PUBLIC THAT'S THE FINAL EXAM
EmilyPilloton_2010G SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT STUDIO H ESPECIALLY IN ITS FIRST YEAR IS A SMALL STORY THIRTEEN STUDENTS IT'S TWO TEACHERS IT'S ONE PROJECT IN ONE PLACE
EmilyPilloton_2010G BUT WE FEEL LIKE THIS COULD WORK IN OTHER PLACES AND I REALLY STRONGLY BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF THE SMALL STORY BECAUSE IT IS SO DIFFICULT
EmilyPilloton_2010G TO DO HUMANITARIAN WORK AT A GLOBAL SCALE BECAUSE WHEN YOU ZOOM OUT THAT FAR YOU LOSE THE ABILITY TO VIEW PEOPLE AS HUMANS
EmilyPilloton_2010G AND LET 'S FACE IT DESIGNERS WE NEED TO REINVENT OURSELVES WE NEED TO RE EDUCATE OURSELVES AROUND THE THINGS THAT MATTER WE NEED TO WORK OUTSIDE OF OUR COMFORT ZONES MORE AND WE NEED TO BE BETTER CITIZENS IN OUR OWN BACKYARD
