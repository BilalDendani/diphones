AmandaPalmer_2013 SO I DIDN 'T ALWAYS MAKE MY LIVING FROM MUSIC FOR ABOUT THE FIVE YEARS AFTER GRADUATING FROM AN UPSTANDING LIBERAL ARTS UNIVERSITY THIS
AmandaPalmer_2013 OF SADNESS AND LONGING
AmandaPalmer_2013 WE WOULD GET THIS BEAUTIFUL MOMENT OF PROLONGED EYE CONTACT
AmandaPalmer_2013 BEING ALLOWED IN A CITY STREET AND WE WOULD SORT OF
AmandaPalmer_2013 NOBODY EVER SEES ME
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND UNFAIR SHAMEFUL
AmandaPalmer_2013 I HAD NO IDEA HOW PERFECT A REAL EDUCATION I WAS GETTING FOR THE MUSIC BUSINESS ON THIS BOX
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND FOR THE ECONOMISTS OUT THERE YOU MAY BE INTERESTED TO KNOW I ACTUALLY MADE A PRETTY PREDICTABLE INCOME WHICH WAS SHOCKING TO ME GIVEN I HAD NO REGULAR CUSTOMERS BUT PRETTY MUCH SIXTY BUCKS ON A TUESDAY NINETY BUCKS ON A FRIDAY IT WAS CONSISTENT
AmandaPalmer_2013 CONNECTION WITH PEOPLE BECAUSE I LOVED IT SO AFTER ALL OF OUR SHOWS WE WOULD SIGN AUTOGRAPHS AND HUG FANS AND HANG OUT AND TALK TO PEOPLE AND WE MADE AN ART OUT OF ASKING PEOPLE TO HELP US
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND JOIN US AND I WOULD TRACK DOWN LOCAL MUSICIANS AND ARTISTS AND THEY WOULD SET UP OUTSIDE OF OUR SHOWS AND THEY WOULD PASS THE HAT AND THEN THEY WOULD COME IN AND JOIN US ONSTAGE SO WE HAD THIS ROTATING SMORGASBORD OF WEIRD RANDOM CIRCUS GUESTS
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND THEN TWITTER CAME ALONG AND MADE THINGS EVEN MORE MAGIC BECAUSE I COULD ASK INSTANTLY FOR ANYTHING ANYWHERE SO I WOULD NEED A PIANO TO PRACTICE ON AND AN HOUR LATER I WOULD BE AT A FAN 'S HOUSE THIS IS IN LONDON
AmandaPalmer_2013 PEOPLE WOULD BRING HOME COOKED FOOD TO US ALL OVER THE WORLD BACKSTAGE AND FEED US AND EAT WITH US THIS IS IN SEATTLE FANS WHO WORKED IN MUSEUMS AND STORES AND ANY KIND OF PUBLIC SPACE WOULD WAVE THEIR HANDS IF I WOULD DECIDE TO DO A LAST MINUTE SPONTANEOUS FREE GIG THIS IS A LIBRARY IN AUCKLAND
AmandaPalmer_2013 ON SATURDAY I TWEETED FOR THIS CRATE AND
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND A NURSE FROM A HOSPITAL DROVE ONE RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT TO THE CAFE I WAS IN AND I BOUGHT HER A SMOOTHIE AND WE SAT THERE TALKING ABOUT NURSING AND DEATH AND I LOVE THIS KIND OF RANDOM CLOSENESS WHICH IS LUCKY BECAUSE I DO A LOT OF COUCHSURFING
AmandaPalmer_2013 IN MANSIONS WHERE EVERYONE IN MY CREW GETS THEIR OWN ROOM BUT THERE 'S NO WIRELESS AND IN PUNK SQUATS EVERYONE ON THE FLOOR IN ONE ROOM WITH NO TOILETS BUT WITH WIRELESS CLEARLY MAKING IT THE BETTER OPTION
AmandaPalmer_2013 MIAMI NEIGHBORHOOD AND WE FOUND OUT THAT OUR COUCHSURFING HOST FOR THE NIGHT WAS AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL STILL LIVING AT HOME AND HER FAMILY WERE ALL UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS FROM HONDURAS AND THAT NIGHT HER WHOLE FAMILY
AmandaPalmer_2013 TOOK THE COUCHES AND SHE SLEPT TOGETHER WITH HER MOM
AmandaPalmer_2013 SO THAT WE COULD TAKE THEIR BEDS
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND I LAY THERE THINKING
AmandaPalmer_2013 THESE PEOPLE HAVE SO LITTLE
AmandaPalmer_2013 TO ME IN HER BROKEN ENGLISH
AmandaPalmer_2013 THIS IS THIS
AmandaPalmer_2013 COUCHSURFING AND CROWDSURFING ARE BASICALLY THE SAME THING YOU 'RE FALLING INTO THE AUDIENCE AND YOU 'RE TRUSTING EACH OTHER
AmandaPalmer_2013 I ONCE ASKED AN OPENING BAND OF MINE IF THEY WANTED TO GO OUT INTO THE CROWD AND PASS THE HAT TO GET THEMSELVES SOME EXTRA MONEY SOMETHING THAT I DID A LOT AND AS USUAL THE BAND WAS PSYCHED BUT THERE WAS THIS ONE GUY IN THE BAND WHO TOLD ME HE JUST COULDN 'T BRING HIMSELF TO GO OUT THERE IT FELT TOO MUCH LIKE BEGGING TO STAND THERE
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND GET A JOB
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND MEANWHILE MY BAND IS BECOMING BIGGER AND BIGGER WE SIGNED WITH A MAJOR LABEL
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND I WAS LIKE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ISN 'T THAT A LOT THEY WERE LIKE NO THE SALES ARE GOING DOWN IT 'S A FAILURE AND THEY WALK OFF
AmandaPalmer_2013 I 'M SORRY I BURNED YOUR CD FROM A FRIEND
AmandaPalmer_2013 BUT I READ YOUR BLOG I KNOW YOU HATE YOUR LABEL I JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS MONEY
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND THIS STARTS HAPPENING ALL THE TIME
AmandaPalmer_2013 I BECOME THE HAT
AmandaPalmer_2013 AFTER MY OWN GIGS BUT I HAVE TO PHYSICALLY STAND THERE AND TAKE THE HELP FROM PEOPLE AND UNLIKE THE GUY IN THE OPENING BAND I 'VE ACTUALLY HAD A LOT OF PRACTICE STANDING THERE
AmandaPalmer_2013 ON THE STREET SO I FOUGHT MY WAY OFF MY LABEL AND FOR MY NEXT PROJECT WITH MY NEW BAND THE GRAND THEFT ORCHESTRA I TURNED TO CROWDFUNDING
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND I FELL INTO THOSE THOUSANDS OF CONNECTIONS THAT I 'D MADE AND I ASKED MY CROWD TO CATCH ME
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND THE GOAL WAS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS MY FANS BACKED ME AT NEARLY ONE POINT TWO MILLION
AmandaPalmer_2013 WHICH WAS THE BIGGEST MUSIC CROWDFUNDING PROJECT
AmandaPalmer_2013 HOW MANY PEOPLE IT IS
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND THE MEDIA ASKED AMANDA THE MUSIC BUSINESS IS TANKING AND YOU ENCOURAGE PIRACY HOW DID YOU MAKE ALL THESE PEOPLE PAY FOR MUSIC AND THE REAL ANSWER IS I DIDN 'T MAKE THEM
AmandaPalmer_2013 I ASKED THEM
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND THROUGH THE VERY
AmandaPalmer_2013 AFTER MY KICKSTARTER WENT BIG FOR CONTINUING MY CRAZY CROWDSOURCING PRACTICES SPECIFICALLY FOR ASKING MUSICIANS
AmandaPalmer_2013 WHO ARE FANS IF THEY WANTED TO JOIN US ON STAGE FOR A FEW SONGS IN EXCHANGE FOR LOVE AND TICKETS AND BEER AND THIS WAS A DOCTORED IMAGE THAT WENT UP OF ME ON A WEBSITE
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND THIS HURT IN A REALLY FAMILIAR WAY AND PEOPLE SAYING
AmandaPalmer_2013 YOU 'RE NOT ALLOWED ANYMORE TO ASK FOR THAT KIND OF HELP
AmandaPalmer_2013 REALLY REMINDED ME
AmandaPalmer_2013 OF THE PEOPLE IN THEIR CARS YELLING GET A JOB
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND THEY COULDN 'T SEE
AmandaPalmer_2013 THE EXCHANGE THAT WAS HAPPENING BETWEEN ME AND MY CROWD AN EXCHANGE THAT WAS VERY FAIR TO US BUT ALIEN
AmandaPalmer_2013 NOW LET ME TELL YOU IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE VISCERAL FEELING OF TRUSTING STRANGERS
AmandaPalmer_2013 I RECOMMEND THIS
AmandaPalmer_2013 ESPECIALLY IF THOSE STRANGERS ARE DRUNK GERMAN PEOPLE
AmandaPalmer_2013 THIS WAS A NINJA MASTER LEVEL FAN CONNECTION BECAUSE WHAT I WAS REALLY SAYING HERE WAS
AmandaPalmer_2013 I TRUST YOU THIS MUCH
AmandaPalmer_2013 MUSICIANS ARTISTS
AmandaPalmer_2013 CONNECTORS AND OPENERS NOT UNTOUCHABLE STARS CELEBRITY IS ABOUT A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVING YOU FROM A DISTANCE BUT THE INTERNET AND THE CONTENT THAT WE 'RE FREELY ABLE TO SHARE ON IT ARE TAKING US BACK
AmandaPalmer_2013 IT 'S ABOUT A FEW PEOPLE LOVING YOU UP CLOSE
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE
AmandaPalmer_2013 NOW THE ONLINE TOOLS TO MAKE THE EXCHANGE AS EASY AND AS INSTINCTIVE AS THE STREET THEY 'RE GETTING THERE
AmandaPalmer_2013 BUT THE PERFECT TOOLS AREN 'T GOING TO HELP US
AmandaPalmer_2013 IF WE CAN 'T FACE EACH OTHER
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND GIVE AND RECEIVE FEARLESSLY BUT MORE IMPORTANT
AmandaPalmer_2013 ON THE INTERNET THE WAY I COULD ON THE BOX
AmandaPalmer_2013 SO BLOGGING AND TWEETING NOT JUST ABOUT MY TOUR DATES AND MY NEW VIDEO BUT ABOUT OUR WORK AND OUR ART AND OUR FEARS AND OUR HANGOVERS
AmandaPalmer_2013 OUR MISTAKES AND WE SEE EACH OTHER
AmandaPalmer_2013 AND I THINK WHEN WE REALLY
AmandaPalmer_2013 I THINK PEOPLE HAVE BEEN OBSESSED WITH THE WRONG QUESTION WHICH IS HOW DO WE MAKE PEOPLE PAY FOR MUSIC
AmandaPalmer_2013 WHAT IF WE STARTED ASKING
