MenaTrott_2006 AND IT'S PRETTY SAD BECAUSE HOW I ONLY GO BACK FIVE GENERATIONS AND THEN IT'S IT I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAPPENS ON MY MOM 'S SIDE BECAUSE SHE'S FROM CUBA AND I DON'T HAVE THAT MANY THINGS
MenaTrott_2006 THIS IS MY GREAT GREAT GRANDMOTHER THIS IS THE ONLY PICTURE I HAVE AND TO THINK OF WHAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO WITH OUR BLOGS

MenaTrott_2006 AND HER SISTER CAME ON
MenaTrott_2006 AND SHE SAID THAT THAT EMMA HAD PASSED AWAY AND ALL OF OUR SUPPORT STAFF WHO HAD TALKED TO HER WERE WERE REALLY EMOTIONAL AND IT WAS A VERY HARD DAY AT THE COMPANY
MenaTrott_2006 AND IT WAS THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE INSTANCES WHERE I REALIZED HOW MUCH BLOGGING AFFECTS OUR RELATIONSHIP AND FLATTENING THIS SORT OF WORLD THAT THIS WOMAN IS IN ENGLAND AND SHE LIVES
MenaTrott_2006 SHE LIVED A LIFE WHERE SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT HER WHAT SHE WAS DOING BUT THE BIG THING THAT
MenaTrott_2006 REALLY INFLUENCED US WAS HER SISTER WROTE TO ME AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW AND SHE WROTE ON THIS BLOG THAT WRITING HER BLOG DURING THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS OF HER LIFE WAS PROBABLY THE BEST THING THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER AND BEING ABLE TO TALK TO PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO SHARE
MenaTrott_2006 WHAT WAS GOING ON AND BEING ABLE TO WRITE AND RECEIVE COMMENTS AND THAT WAS AMAZING TO BE ABLE TO KNOW THAT WE HAD EMPOWERED THAT AND THAT
MenaTrott_2006 BLOGGING WAS SOMETHING THAT SHE FELT COMFORTABLE DOING AND THAT THE IDEA THAT BLOGGING DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SCARY THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE ATTACK OF THE BLOGS THAT WE CAN BE PEOPLE WHO ARE OPEN AND WANTING TO HELP AND TALK TO PEOPLE THAT WAS AN AMAZING THING AND
MenaTrott_2006 AND SO I PRINTED OUT HER OR I SENT A PDF OF HER BLOG TO HER FAMILY AND THEY PASSED IT OUT AT HER MEMORIAL SERVICE AND EVEN IN HER HER OBITUARY THEY MENTIONED HER BLOG BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A BIG PART OF HER LIFE AND THAT'S A HUGE THING
