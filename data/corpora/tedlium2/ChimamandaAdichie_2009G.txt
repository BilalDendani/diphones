ChimamandaAdichie_2009G A STORYTELLER AND I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU A FEW PERSONAL STORIES ABOUT
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G WHAT I LIKE TO CALL THE DANGER OF THE SINGLE STORY
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G I GREW UP ON A UNIVERSITY CAMPUS IN EASTERN NIGERIA MY MOTHER SAYS THAT I STARTED READING AT THE AGE OF TWO
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G ALTHOUGH I THINK FOUR IS PROBABLY CLOSE TO THE TRUTH
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G SO I WAS AN EARLY READER AND WHAT I READ WERE BRITISH AND AMERICAN CHILDREN 'S BOOKS
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G I WAS ALSO AN EARLY WRITER AND WHEN I BEGAN TO WRITE AT ABOUT THE AGE OF SEVEN
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G ALL MY CHARACTERS WERE WHITE AND BLUE
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G THEY PLAYED IN THE SNOW
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G THEY ATE APPLES AND THEY TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE WEATHER HOW LOVELY IT WAS THAT THE SUN HAD COME OUT
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G NOW THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT I LIVED IN NIGERIA I HAD NEVER BEEN OUTSIDE NIGERIA
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G WE DIDN'T HAVE SNOW
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G AND FOR MANY YEARS AFTERWARDS I WOULD HAVE A DESPERATE DESIRE TO TASTE GINGER BEER BUT THAT IS ANOTHER STORY WHAT THIS DEMONSTRATES I THINK
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G IS HOW IMPRESSIONABLE AND VULNERABLE WE ARE IN THE FACE OF A STORY PARTICULARLY AS CHILDREN
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G NOW THINGS CHANGED WHEN I DISCOVERED AFRICAN BOOKS
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G MANY OF THEM AVAILABLE AND THEY WEREN'T QUITE AS EASY TO FIND AS THE FOREIGN BOOKS BUT BECAUSE OF WRITERS LIKE CHINUA ACHEBE AND CAMARA LAYE I WENT THROUGH A MENTAL SHIFT IN MY PERCEPTION OF LITERATURE
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G I REALIZED THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G GIRLS WITH SKIN THE COLOR OF CHOCOLATE WHOSE
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G KINKY HAIR COULD NOT FORM PONYTAILS COULD ALSO EXIST IN LITERATURE I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT THINGS I RECOGNIZED
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G NOW I LOVED THOSE AMERICAN AND BRITISH BOOKS I READ THEY STIRRED MY IMAGINATION THEY OPENED UP NEW WORLDS FOR ME
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G BUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT I DID NOT KNOW THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME COULD EXIST IN LITERATURE
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G SO WHAT THE DISCOVERY OF AFRICAN WRITERS DID FOR ME WAS THIS IT SAVED ME FROM HAVING A SINGLE STORY OF WHAT BOOKS
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G I COME FROM A CONVENTIONAL MIDDLE CLASS NIGERIAN FAMILY MY FATHER WAS A PROFESSOR
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G MY MOTHER WAS AN ADMINISTRATOR
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G SO THE YEAR I TURNED EIGHT WE GOT A NEW HOUSE BOY
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G THE ONLY THING MY MOTHER TOLD US ABOUT HIM WAS THAT HIS FAMILY WAS VERY POOR
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G MY MOTHER SENT YAMS AND RICE AND OUR OLD CLOTHES TO HIS FAMILY AND WHEN I DIDN'T FINISH MY DINNER MY MOTHER WOULD SAY FINISH YOUR FOOD DON'T YOU KNOW PEOPLE LIKE FIDE 'S FAMILY HAVE NOTHING
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G SO I FELT ENORMOUS PITY
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G ONE SATURDAY WE WENT TO HIS VILLAGE TO VISIT AND HIS MOTHER SHOWED US A BEAUTIFULLY PATTERNED BASKET MADE OF DYED RAFFIA THAT HIS BROTHER HAD
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO ME THAT ANYBODY IN HIS FAMILY COULD ACTUALLY MAKE SOMETHING
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G ALL I HAD HEARD ABOUT THEM IS HOW POOR THEY WERE SO THAT IT HAD BECOME IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SEE THEM AS ANYTHING ELSE BUT POOR
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G YEARS LATER I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS WHEN I LEFT NIGERIA TO GO TO UNIVERSITY IN THE UNITED STATES I WAS NINETEEN
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G SHE ASKED WHERE I HAD LEARNED TO SPEAK ENGLISH SO WELL AND WAS CONFUSED WHEN I SAID THAT NIGERIA HAPPENED TO HAVE ENGLISH AS ITS OFFICIAL LANGUAGE
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G SHE ASKED IF SHE COULD LISTED TO WHAT SHE CALLED MY TRIBAL MUSIC AND WAS CONSEQUENTLY VERY DISSAPOINTED WHEN I PRODUCED MY TAPE OF MARIAH CAREY
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G SHE ASSUMED THAT I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO USE
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G WHAT STRUCK ME WAS THIS SHE HAD FELT SORRY FOR ME EVEN BEFORE SHE SAW ME HER DEFAULT POSITION TOWARD ME AS AN AFRICAN WAS A KIND OF PATRONIZING WELL MEANING PITY
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G MY ROOMMATE HAD A SINGLE STORY OF AFRICA
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G A SINGLE STORY OF CATASTROPHE
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G IN THIS SINGLE STORY THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF AFRICANS BEING SIMILAR TO HER IN ANY WAY NO POSSIBILITY OF FEELINGS MORE COMPLEX THAN PITY NO POSSIBILITY OF A CONNECTION AS HUMAN
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G I MUST SAY THAT BEFORE I WENT TO THE U S I DIDN'T CONSCIOUSLY IDENTIFY AS AFRICAN BUT IN THE U S WHENEVER AFRICA CAME UP PEOPLE TURNED TO ME NEVER MIND THAT I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT PLACES LIKE NAMIBIA
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G BUT I DID COME TO EMBRACE THIS NEW IDENTITY AND IN MANY WAYS I THINK OF MYSELF NOW AS AFRICAN ALTHOUGH I STILL GET QUITE IRRITABLE WHEN AFRICA IS REFERRED TO AS A COUNTRY THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE BEING MY
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G SO AFTER I HAD SPENT SOME YEARS IN THE U S AS AN AFRICAN I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND MY ROOMMATE 'S RESPONSE TO ME
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G IF I HAD NOT GROWN UP IN NIGERIA AND IF ALL I KNEW ABOUT AFRICA WERE FROM POPULAR IMAGES I TOO WOULD THINK THAT AFRICA WAS A PLACE OF BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES BEAUTIFUL ANIMALS
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE PEOPLE FIGHTING SENSELESS WARS DYING OF POVERTY AND AIDS UNABLE TO SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES AND
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G BY A KIND WHITE FOREIGNER I WOULD SEE AFRICANS IN THE SAME WAY THAT I AS A CHILD HAD SEEN FIDE 'S FAMILY
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G A FASCINATING ACCOUNT OF HIS VOYAGE
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G AFTER REFERRING TO THE BLACK AFRICANS AS BEASTS WHO HAVE NO HOUSES HE WRITES THEY ARE ALSO PEOPLE WITHOUT HEADS HAVING THEIR MOUTH AND EYES IN THEIR BREASTS
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G NOW I'VE LAUGHED EVERY TIME I'VE READ THIS AND ONE MUST ADMIRE THE IMAGINATION OF JOHN LOCKE BUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT HIS WRITING IS THAT IT REPRESENTS THE BEGINNING OF A TRADITION OF TELLING AFRICAN STORIES IN THE WEST
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G A TRADITION OF SUB SAHARAN AFRICA AS A PLACE OF NEGATIVES OF DIFFERENCE OF DARKNESS OF PEOPLE WHO IN THE WORDS OF THE WONDERFUL POET RUDYARD KIPLING ARE HALF DEVIL HALF CHILD
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G AND SO I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT MY AMERICAN ROOMMATE MUST HAVE THROUGHOUT HER LIFE SEEN AND HEARD DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THIS SINGLE STORY AS HAD A PROFESSOR WHO ONCE TOLD ME THAT MY NOVEL WAS NOT AUTHENTICALLY
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G IN A NUMBER OF PLACES BUT I HAD NOT QUITE IMAGINED THAT IT HAD FAILED AT ACHIEVING SOMETHING CALLED AFRICAN AUTHENTICITY IN FACT I DID NOT KNOW WHAT AFRICAN AUTHENTICITY WAS
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G THE PROFESSOR TOLD ME THAT MY CHARACTERS
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G TOO MUCH LIKE HIM
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G BUT I MUST QUICKLY ADD THAT I TOO AM JUST AS GUILTY IN THE QUESTION OF THE SINGLE STORY
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G A FEW YEARS AGO I VISITED MEXICO FROM THE U S
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G THE POLITICAL CLIMATE IN THE U S AT THE TIME WAS TENSE AND THERE WERE DEBATES GOING ON ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND AS OFTEN HAPPENS IN AMERICA IMMIGRATION BECAME SYNONYMOUS WITH MEXICANS
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G WERE ENDLESS STORIES OF MEXICANS AS PEOPLE WHO WERE FLEECING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM SNEAKING ACROSS THE BORDER BEING ARRESTED AT THE BORDER THAT SORT OF THING
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G I REMEMBER WALKING AROUND ON MY FIRST DAY IN
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G WATCHING THE PEOPLE GOING TO WORK ROLLING UP TORTILLAS IN THE MARKETPLACE SMOKING LAUGHING
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G I REMEMBER FIRST FEELING SLIGHT SURPRISE AND THEN I WAS OVERWHELMED WITH SHAME I REALIZED
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G I HAD BOUGHT INTO THE SINGLE STORY OF MEXICANS AND I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ASHAMED OF MYSELF
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G SO THAT IS HOW TO CREATE A SINGLE STORY SHOW A PEOPLE
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G AS ONE THING AS ONLY ONE THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THAT IS WHAT THEY BECOME
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TALK ABOUT THE SINGLE STORY WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT POWER
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G THERE IS A WORD AN IGBO WORD THAT I THINK ABOUT WHENEVER I THINK ABOUT THE POWER STRUCTURES OF THE WORLD AND IT IS
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G IT'S A NOUN THAT LOOSELY TRANSLATES TO TO BE GREATER THAN ANOTHER
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G LIKE OUR ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WORLDS STORIES TOO ARE DEFINED
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G BY THE PRINCIPLE OF
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G HOW THEY ARE TOLD WHO TELLS THEM WHEN THEY'RE TOLD HOW MANY STORIES ARE TOLD ARE REALLY DEPENDENT ON POWER
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G POWER IS THE ABILITY NOT JUST TO TELL THE STORY OF ANOTHER PERSON BUT TO MAKE IT THE DEFINITIVE STORY OF THAT PERSON THE PALESTINIAN POET MOURID BARGHOUTI WRITES THAT
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G IF YOU WANT TO DISPOSSESS A PEOPLE THE SIMPLEST WAY TO DO IT IS TO TELL THEIR STORY AND TO START WITH SECONDLY
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G START THE STORY WITH THE ARROWS OF THE NATIVE AMERICANS AND NOT WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE BRITISH AND YOU HAVE AND ENTIRELY DIFFERENT STORY
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G START THE STORY WITH THE FAILURE OF THE AFRICAN STATE AND NOT WITH THE COLONIAL CREATION OF THE AFRICAN STATE AND YOU HAVE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT STORY
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G I RECENTLY SPOKE AT A UNIVERSITY WHERE
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G A STUDENT TOLD ME THAT IT WAS SUCH A SHAME THAT NIGERIAN MEN WERE PHYSICAL ABUSERS LIKE THE FATHER CHARACTER IN MY NOVEL
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD JUST READ A NOVEL CALLED AMERICAN PSYCHO
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G AND THAT IT WAS SUCH A SHAME THAT YOUNG AMERICANS WERE SERIAL
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G NOW
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED TO ME TO THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE I HAD READ A NOVEL IN WHICH A CHARACTER WAS A SERIAL KILLER THAT HE WAS SOMEHOW REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G WHEN I LEARNED SOME YEARS AGO THAT WRITERS WERE EXPECTED TO HAVE HAD REALLY UNHAPPY CHILDHOODS TO BE SUCCESSFUL I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT HOW I COULD INVENT HORRIBLE THINGS MY PARENTS HAD DONE TO ME
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT I HAD A VERY HAPPY CHILDHOOD FULL OF LAUGHTER AND LOVE IN A VERY CLOSE KNIT FAMILY
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G BUT I ALSO HAD GRANDFATHERS WHO DIED IN REFUGEE CAMPS MY COUSIN POLLE DIED BECAUSE HE COULD NOT GET ADEQUATE HEALTHCARE ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS OKOLOMA DIED IN A PLANE CRASH BECAUSE OUR FIRETRUCKS DID NOT HAVE WATER
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G I GREW UP UNDER REPRESSIVE MILITARY GOVERNMENTS THAT DEVALUED EDUCATION SO THAT SOMETIMES MY PARENTS WERE NOT PAID THEIR SALARIES
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G AND SO AS A CHILD I SAW JAM DISAPPEAR FROM THE BREAKFAST TABLE THEN MARGARINE DISAPPEARED THEN BREAD BECAME TOO EXPENSIVE THEN MILK BECAME RATIONED
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G AND MOST OF ALL A KIND OF NORMALIZED POLITICAL FEAR INVADED OUR LIVES
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G ALL OF THESE STORIES MAKE ME WHO I AM
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G BUT TO INSIST ON ONLY THESE NEGATIVE STORIES IS TO FLATTEN MY EXPERIENCE
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G AND TO OVERLOOK THE MANY OTHER STORIES THAT FORMED ME
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G THE SINGLE STORY CREATES STEREOTYPES AND THE PROBLEM WITH STEREOTYPES IS NOT THAT THEY ARE UNTRUE BUT THAT THEY ARE INCOMPLETE
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G THEY MAKE ONE STORY BECOME THE ONLY STORY
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G ABOUT CATASTROPHE AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IT IS JUST AS IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT THEM I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ENGAGE PROPERLY WITH A PLACE OR A PERSON WITHOUT ENGAGING WITH ALL OF THE STORIES OF
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE SINGLE STORY IS THIS IT ROBS PEOPLE OF DIGNITY
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G IT MAKES OUR RECOGNITION OF OUR EQUAL HUMANITY DIFFICULT IT EMPHASIZES HOW WE ARE DIFFERENT RATHER THAN HOW WE ARE SIMILAR
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G SO WHAT IF BEFORE MY MEXICAN TRIP I HAD FOLLOWED THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE FROM BOTH SIDES THE U S AND THE MEXICAN WHAT IF MY MOTHER HAD TOLD US THAT FIDE 'S FAMILY WAS POOR
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G AND HARDWORKING WHAT IF WE HAD AN AFRICAN TELEVISION NETWORK THAT BROADCAST DIVERSE AFRICAN STORIES ALL OVER THE WORLD WHAT THE NIGERIAN WRITER CHINUA ACHEBE CALLS A BALANCE OF STORIES
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G WHAT IF MY ROOMMATE KNEW ABOUT MY NIGERIAN PUBLISHER MUKTA BAKARAY A REMARKABLE MAN WHO LEFT HIS JOB IN A BANK TO FOLLOW HIS DREAM AND START A PUBLISHING HOUSE NOW THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM WAS THAT NIGERIANS DON'T READ LITERATURE
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G HE DISAGREED HE FELT THAT PEOPLE WHO COULD READ WOULD READ IF YOU MADE LITERATURE AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE TO THEM
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G I REALLY LIKED YOUR NOVEL I DIDN'T LIKE THE ENDING NOW YOU MUST WRITE A SEQUEL AND THIS IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G AND SHE WENT ON TO TELL ME WHAT TO WRITE IN THE SEQUEL
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G NOW I WAS NOT ONLY CHARMED I WAS VERY MOVED HERE WAS A WOMAN PART OF THE ORDINARY MASSES OF NIGERIANS WHO WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G HAD NOT ONLY READ THE BOOK BUT SHE HAD TAKEN OWNERSHIP OF IT AND FELT JUSTIFIED IN TELLING ME WHAT TO WRITE IN THE SEQUEL
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G NOW WHAT IF MY ROOMMATE KNEW ABOUT MY FRIEND FUMI ONDA A FEARLESS WOMAN WHO HOSTS A TV SHOW IN LAGOS AND IS DETERMINED TO TELL THE STORIES THAT WE PREFER TO FORGET WHAT IF MY ROOMMATE KNEW
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G ABOUT THE HEART PROCEDURE THAT WAS PERFORMED IN THE LAGOS HOSPITAL LAST WEEK WHAT IF MY ROOMMATE KNEW ABOUT CONTEMPORARY NIGERIAN MUSIC
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G WHAT IF MY ROOMMATE KNEW ABOUT THE FEMALE LAWYER WHO RECENTLY WENT TO COURT IN NIGERIA TO CHALLENGE A RIDICULOUS LAW THAT REQUIRED WOMEN TO GET THEIR HUSBAND 'S CONSENT BEFORE RENEWING THEIR PASSPORTS
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G WHAT IF MY ROOMMATE KNEW ABOUT NOLLYWOOD
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G FULL OF INNOVATIVE PEOPLE MAKING FILMS DESPITE GREAT TECHNICAL ODDS FILMS SO POPULAR THAT THEY REALLY ARE THE BEST EXAMPLE OF NIGERIANS CONSUMING WHAT THEY PRODUCE
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G WHAT IF MY ROOMMATE KNEW ABOUT MY WONDERFULLY AMBITIOUS HAIR BRAIDER WHO HAS JUST STARTED HER OWN BUSINESS SELLING HAIR EXTENSIONS OR ABOUT THE MILLIONS OF OTHER NIGERIANS WHO START BUSINESSES AND SOMETIMES FAIL BUT CONTINUE TO NURSE AMBITION
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G EVERY TIME I AM HOME I AM CONFRONTED WITH THE USUAL SOURCES OF IRRITATION FOR MOST NIGERIANS OUR FAILED INFRASTRUCTURE OUR FAILED GOVERNMENT
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G I TEACH WRITING WORKSHOPS IN LAGOS EVERY SUMMER AND IT IS AMAZING TO ME HOW MANY PEOPLE APPLY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE EAGER TO WRITE TO TELL STORIES
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G MY NIGERIAN PUBLISHER AND I HAVE JUST STARTED A NON PROFIT CALLED FARAFINA TRUST AND
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G WE HAVE BIG DREAMS OF BUILDING LIBRARIES AND REFURBISHING LIBRARIES THAT ALREADY EXIST AND PROVIDING BOOKS FOR STATE SCHOOLS THAT DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN THEIR LIBRARIES
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G AND ALSO OF ORGANIZING LOTS AND LOTS OF WORKSHOPS IN READING AND WRITING FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE EAGER TO TELL OUR MANY STORIES STORIES MATTER
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G MANY STORIES MATTER STORIES HAVE BEEN USED TO DISPOSSESS AND TO MALIGN BUT STORIES CAN ALSO BE USED TO EMPOWER
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G AND TO HUMANIZE STORIES CAN BREAK THE DIGNITY OF A PEOPLE BUT STORIES CAN ALSO REPAIR THAT BROKEN DIGNITY
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G THE AMERICAN WRITER ALICE WALKER WROTE THIS ABOUT HER SOUTHERN RELATIVES WHO HAD MOVED TO THE NORTH SHE INTRODUCED THEM TO A BOOK ABOUT THE SOUTHERN LIFE THAT THEY HAD LEFT BEHIND
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G THEY SAT AROUND READING THE BOOK THEMSELVES LISTENING TO ME READ THE BOOK
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G AND A KIND OF PARADISE
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G I WOULD LIKE TO END WITH THIS THOUGHT
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G THAT WHEN WE REJECT THE SINGLE STORY WHEN WE REALIZE THAT THERE IS NEVER
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G WE REGAIN A KIND OF PARADISE
