AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G WE LOOKED AT THE HISTORICAL ATTEMPTS THAT HAD BEEN OUT
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G WE HAVE GLASS COCKPIT AVIONICS THAT BRING THE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO FLY DIRECTLY TO YOU IN THE COCKPIT
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G BUT WITHOUT FUNDAMENTALLY ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE WE REALIZED THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE GETTING THE SAME RESULT
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G THAT PEOPLE HAD BEEN GETTING FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS WHICH ISN 'T WHERE WE WANT TO BE RIGHT NOW
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G SO INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MAKE A CAR THAT CAN FLY WE DECIDED TO TRY TO MAKE A PLANE THAT COULD DRIVE
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G AFTER TWO YEARS OF AN INNOVATIVE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PROCESS THE PROOF OF CONCEPT MADE ITS PUBLIC DEBUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT NOW LIKE WITH ANYTHING THAT 'S REALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE STATUS QUO IT DIDN 'T ALWAYS GO SO WELL TESTING THAT AIRCRAFT
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G AND WE DISCOVERED THAT IT 'S A VERY GOOD THING
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G THE PICTURE BEHIND ME WAS SNAPPED BY THE COPILOT IN OUR CHASE AIRCRAFT JUST MOMENTS AFTER THE WHEELS GOT OFF THE GROUND FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WE WERE ALL VERY FLATTERED TO SEE THAT IMAGE BECOME A SYMBOL OF ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE HAD THOUGHT WAS IMPOSSIBLE REALLY THE WORLD OVER
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G THE FLIGHT TESTING THAT FOLLOWED THAT WAS AS BASIC AND LOW RISK AS WE COULD MAKE IT BUT IT STILL ACCOMPLISHED WHAT WE NEEDED TO TO TAKE THE PROGRAM TO THE NEXT STEP AND TO GAIN THE CREDIBILITY THAT WE NEEDED WITHIN OUR EVENTUAL MARKET THE GENERAL AVIATION COMMUNITY AND WITH THE REGULATORS THAT GOVERN THE USE OF DESIGN OF AIRCRAFT PARTICULARLY IN THE STATES
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G THE FAA ABOUT A YEAR AGO GAVE US AN EXEMPTION FOR THE TRANSITION TO ALLOW US TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED AND TEN LBS WITHIN THE LIGHT SPORT AIRCRAFT CATEGORY
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G NOW THAT DOESN 'T SOUND LIKE A LOT BUT IT 'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE BEING ABLE TO DELIVER THE TRANSITION AS A LIGHT SPORT AIRCRAFT MAKES IT SIMPLER FOR US TO CERTIFY IT BUT IT ALSO MAKES IT MUCH EASIER FOR YOU TO LEARN HOW TO FLY
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G IT TURNS OUT THAT DRIVING WITH ITS ASSOCIATED DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION AND REGULATORY HURDLES IS ACTUALLY A HARDER PROBLEM TO SOLVE THAN FLYING
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G FOR THOSE OF US THAT SPEND MOST OF OUR LIVES ON THE GROUND THIS MAY BE COUNTER INTUITIVE BUT DRIVING HAS POTHOLES COBBLESTONES PEDESTRIANS OTHER DRIVERS AND A RATHER LONG AND DETAILED LIST OF FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS TO CONTEND WITH
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G FORTUNATELY NECESSITY REMAINS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION AND A LOT OF THE DESIGN WORK THAT WE 'RE THE MOST PROUD OF WITH THE AIRCRAFT CAME OUT OF SOLVING THE UNIQUE PROBLEMS OF OPERATING IT ON THE GROUND
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G EVERYTHING FROM A CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION AND LIQUID BASED COOLING SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS US TO USE AN AIRCRAFT ENGINE IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC TO A CUSTOM DESIGNED GEARBOX THAT POWERS EITHER THE PROPELLER WHEN YOU 'RE FLYING OR THE WHEELS ON THE GROUND TO THE AUTOMATED WING FOLDING MECHANISM THAT WE 'LL SEE IN A MOMENT
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G TO CRASH SAFETY FEATURES WE HAVE A CARBON FIBER SAFETY CAGE THAT PROTECTS THE OCCUPANTS FOR LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF THE WEIGHT OF A TRADITIONAL STEEL CHASSIS IN A CAR
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G WE LEVERAGE A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY FROM THE STATE OF THE ART IN GENERAL AVIATION AND FROM AUTOMOTIVE RACING WHEN WE DO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TRULY OUT OF THE BOX WE USE AN INCREMENTAL DESIGN BUILD TEST REDESIGN CYCLE THAT LETS US REDUCE RISK IN BABY STEPS
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G STILL IF EVERYTHING GOES TO OUR SATISFACTION WITH THE TESTING AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE TWO PRODUCTION PROTOTYPES THAT WE 'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW THOSE FIRST DELIVERIES TO THE ABOUT A HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO HAVE RESERVED AN AIRPLANE AT THIS POINT SHOULD BEGIN AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G THE TRANSITION WILL COST IN LINE WITH OTHER SMALL AIRPLANES AND I 'M CERTAINLY NOT OUT TO REPLACE YOUR CHEVY
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G BUT I DO THINK THAT THE TRANSITION SHOULD BE YOUR NEXT AIRPLANE
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G INSTEAD OF PAYING TO KEEP YOUR AIRPLANE IN A HANGER PARK IT IN YOUR GARAGE AND THE UNLEADED AUTOMOTIVE FUEL THAT WE USE IS BOTH CHEAPER AND BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAN TRADITIONAL AVGAS
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G DOOR TO DOOR TRAVEL TIME IS REDUCED BECAUSE NOW INSTEAD OF LUGGING BAGS FINDING A PARKING SPACE TAKING OFF YOUR SHOES OR PULLING YOUR AIRPLANE OUT OF THE HANGER YOU 'RE NOW JUST SPENDING THAT TIME GETTING TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G THE TRANSITION SIMULTANEOUSLY EXPANDS OUR HORIZONS WHILE MAKING THE WORLD A SMALLER MORE ACCESSIBLE PLACE
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G IT ALSO CONTINUES TO BE A FABULOUS ADVENTURE I HOPE YOU 'LL EACH TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU COULD USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO GIVE YOURSELF MORE ACCESS TO YOUR OWN WORLD AND TO MAKE YOUR OWN TRAVEL MORE CONVENIENT AND MORE FUN
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE
