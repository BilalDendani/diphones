AshrafGhani_2005G@16.02:28.66 A PUBLIC DEWEY LONG AGO OBSERVED IS CONSTITUTED THROUGH DISCUSSION AND DEBATE IF WE ARE TO CALL THE TYRANNY OF ASSUMPTIONS INTO QUESTION
AshrafGhani_2005G@29.53:36.63 AVOID DOXA THE REALM OF THE UNQUESTIONED THEN WE MUST BE WILLING TO SUBJECT OUR OWN ASSUMPTIONS
AshrafGhani_2005G@36.94:43.16 TO DEBATE AND DISCUSSION IT IS IN THIS SPIRIT THAT I
AshrafGhani_2005G@78.29:88.61 THE QUESTION NOW HOWEVER IS BOTH ABOUT WHICH FORM OF CAPITALISM AND WHICH TYPE OF DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION
AshrafGhani_2005G@89.85:98.06 BUT WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS MOMENT HAS BROUGHT ABOUT A RARE CONSENSUS OF ASSUMPTIONS AND THAT
AshrafGhani_2005G@108.28:121.23 OR HOW PROVISIONAL OUR CONSENSUS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD NEITHER BENEFITS FROM CAPITALISM NOR FROM DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS
AshrafGhani_2005G@124.67:130.78 MOST OF THE GLOBE EXPERIENCES THE STATE AS REPRESSIVE AS
AshrafGhani_2005G@141.84:148.06 AND IN TERMS OF EXPERIENCE OF CAPITALISM THERE ARE TWO ASPECTS THAT THE REST OF THE GLOBE EXPERIENCES
AshrafGhani_2005G@148.29:155.54 FIRST EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRY BLOOD DIAMONDS SMUGGLED EMERALDS TIMBER
AshrafGhani_2005G@156.46:169.02 THAT IS CUT RIGHT FROM UNDER THE POOREST SECOND IS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE MIGHT SHOCK YOU BUT IT'S THE WORST FORM OF TODAY OF THE UGLY FACE
AshrafGhani_2005G@169.65:180.15 OF THE DEVELOPED WORLD TO THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE SUPPOSEDLY SPENT ON BUILDING CAPACITY WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE PAID UP TO ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY
AshrafGhani_2005G@200.38:204.31 WE DO NOT LIVE IN THREE DIFFERENT WORLDS WE LIVE
AshrafGhani_2005G@208.21:215.82 BUT THAT'S EASILY SAID BUT WE ARE NOT DEALING WITH THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE ONE WORLD THAT WE ARE LIVING
AshrafGhani_2005G@217.70:227.00 AND THAT IS THAT IF WE WANT TO HAVE ONE WORLD THIS ONE WORLD CANNOT BE BASED ON HUGE POCKETS OF EXCLUSION AND THEN INCLUSION FOR SOME
AshrafGhani_2005G@227.87:232.94 WE MUST NOW FINALLY COME TO THINK ABOUT THE PREMISES OF A TRULY GLOBAL
AshrafGhani_2005G@244.46:252.03 THIS OPEN MOMENT IN HISTORY WHERE WE HAVE A CONSENSUS ON BOTH THE FORM OF POLITICS AND THE FORM OF ECONOMICS
AshrafGhani_2005G@252.76:259.98 WHAT IS ONE OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO PICK WE HAVE THREE CRITICAL TERMS ECONOMY CIVIL SOCIETY
AshrafGhani_2005G@260.68:268.50 AND THE STATE I WILL NOT DEAL WITH THOSE FIRST TWO EXCEPT TO SAY THAT UNCRITICAL TRANSFER OF ASSUMPTIONS
AshrafGhani_2005G@268.78:275.56 FROM ONE CONTEXT TO ANOTHER CAN ONLY MAKE FOR DISASTER ECONOMICS
AshrafGhani_2005G@277.27:286.80 IN MOST OF THE ELITE UNIVERSITIES ARE PRACTICALLY USELESS IN MY CONTEXT MY COUNTRY IS DOMINATED BY DRUG ECONOMY AND A MAFIA
AshrafGhani_2005G@301.95:308.83 AND NOT IMPOSITION OF THE FRAMEWORK THAT WORKS ON THE BASIS OF MATHEMATICAL MODELING FOR WHICH I HAVE ENORMOUS RESPECT
AshrafGhani_2005G@309.40:318.98 MY COLLEAGUES AT JOHNS HOPKINS WERE AMONG THE BEST SECOND INSTEAD OF DEBATING ENDLESSLY ABOUT WHAT IS
AshrafGhani_2005G@329.97:337.56 WE HOPE TO SHARE THAT MUCH WIDELY WITH AND THIRD IS THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY CONSTRUCT AN INDEX TO MEASURE COMPARATIVELY
AshrafGhani_2005G@338.58:347.56 HOW WELL THESE FUNCTIONS THAT WE WOULD AGREE ON ARE BEING PERFORMED IN DIFFERENT PLACES SO WHAT ARE THESE FUNCTIONS WE PROPOSE TEN AND
AshrafGhani_2005G@348.02:356.52 IT'S LEGITIMATE MONOPOLY OF MEANS OF VIOLENCE ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC FINANCES INVESTMENT IN HUMAN CAPITAL PROVISION OF CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS
AshrafGhani_2005G@370.42:383.12 I WON 'T ELABORATE I HOPE THE QUESTIONS WILL GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY THIS IS A FEASIBLE GOAL BASICALLY BECAUSE CONTRARY TO WIDESPREAD ASSUMPTION I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS WHO WOULD HAVE IMAGINED
AshrafGhani_2005G@393.06:401.56 BUT PEOPLE AT OXFORD PREPARED FOR A DEMOCRATIC GERMANY AND ENGAGED IN PLANNING AND THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER EXAMPLES
AshrafGhani_2005G@403.01:416.37 NOW IN ORDER TO DO THIS AND THIS BRINGS THIS GROUP WE HAVE TO RETHINK THE NOTION OF CAPITAL THE LEAST IMPORTANT FORM OF CAPITAL IN THIS PROJECT IS FINANCIAL CAPITAL MONEY
AshrafGhani_2005G@417.57:429.45 MONEY IS NOT CAPITAL IN MOST OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IT'S JUST CASH BECAUSE IT LACKS THE INSTITUTIONAL ORGANIZATIONAL MANAGERIAL FORMS TO TURN IT INTO CAPITAL
AshrafGhani_2005G@430.68:441.67 AND WHAT IS REQUIRED IS A COMBINATION OF PHYSICAL CAPITAL INSTITUTIONAL CAPITAL HUMAN CAPITAL AND SECURITY OF COURSE IS CRITICAL BUT SO IS INFORMATION
AshrafGhani_2005G@442.56:455.24 NOW THE ISSUE THAT SHOULD CONCERN US HERE AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO POSE TO THIS GROUP IS AGAIN IT TAKES SIXTEEN YEARS
AshrafGhani_2005G@456.03:463.95 IN YOUR COUNTRIES TO PRODUCE SOMEBODY WITH A BS DEGREE IT TAKES TWENTY YEARS TO PRODUCE SOMEBODY WITH A PHD
AshrafGhani_2005G@464.45:470.40 THE FIRST CHALLENGE IS TO RETHINK FUNDAMENTALLY THE
AshrafGhani_2005G@472.95:477.90 THE TIME DO WE NEED TO REPEAT
AshrafGhani_2005G@485.93:492.15 WHAT IS IT THAT WE NEED TO DO FUNDAMENTALLY TO RE ENGAGE IN A PROJECT THAT CAPITAL FORMATION IS
AshrafGhani_2005G@502.96:510.82 THEY NEED DIFFERENT WAYS OF BEING APPROACHED DIFFERENT WAYS OF BEING ENFRANCHISED DIFFERENT WAYS OF BEING
AshrafGhani_2005G@512.38:520.42 AND THAT'S THE FIRST THING SECOND IS YOU'RE PROBLEM SOLVERS BUT YOU'RE NOT ENGAGING YOUR GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY
AshrafGhani_2005G@522.49:534.10 AWAY FROM THE PROBLEMS OF CORRUPTION YOU ONLY WANT CLEAN ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH TO FUNCTION BUT IF YOU DON'T THINK THROUGH THE PROBLEMS OF CORRUPTION WHO WILL
AshrafGhani_2005G@535.21:547.38 YOU STAY AWAY FROM DESIGN FOR DEVELOPMENT YOU'RE GREAT DESIGNERS BUT YOUR DESIGNS ARE SELFISH IT'S FOR YOUR OWN IMMEDIATE USE THE
AshrafGhani_2005G@566.33:574.10 IS YOUR IMAGINATION TO BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON PROBLEMS THE WAY A MEME IS SUPPOSED TO WORK
AshrafGhani_2005G@575.21:585.22 AS THE WORK ON PARADIGMS LONG TIME AGO SHOWED THOMAS KUHN 'S WORK IT'S IN THE INTERSECTION OF IDEAS THAT NEW DEVELOPMENTS TRUE BREAKTHROUGHS OCCUR
AshrafGhani_2005G@585.66:595.31 AND I HOPE THAT THIS GROUP WOULD BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF STATE AND DEVELOPMENT AND THE EMPOWERMENT OF THE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD 'S POOR THROUGH THIS MEANS THANK YOU
AshrafGhani_2005G@620.39:627.07 WHAT SCARES ME MOST IS IS YOU LACK OF YOUR ENGAGEMENT
AshrafGhani_2005G@630.63:643.28 YOU KNOW I ALWAYS GIVE THE UNCONVENTIONAL ANSWER NO BUT SERIOUSLY THE ISSUE OF AFGHANISTAN FIRST HAS TO BE SEEN AS AT LEAST A TEN TO TWENTY YEAR PERSPECTIVE
AshrafGhani_2005G@644.22:658.17 TODAY THE WORLD OF GLOBALIZATION IS ON SPEED TIME HAS BEEN COMPRESSED AND SPACE DOES NOT EXIST FOR MOST PEOPLE BUT IN MY WORLD YOU KNOW WHEN I WENT BACK TO AFGHANISTAN AFTER TWENTY THREE YEARS
AshrafGhani_2005G@669.47:683.27 SO THE FIRST IS WHEN THE SCALE IS THAT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT JUST THE SIMPLE THINGS THAT ARE INFRASTRUCTURE IT TAKES SIX YEARS TO DELIVER INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR WORLD ANY MEANINGFUL SORT OF
AshrafGhani_2005G@684.33:694.53 BUT THE MODALITY OF ATTENTION OR WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY WHAT'S HAPPENING TOMORROW SECOND IS WHEN A COUNTRY HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO
AshrafGhani_2005G@695.64:708.43 ONE OF THE MOST IMMENSE BRUTAL FORMS OF EXERCISE OF POWER WE HAD THE RED ARMY FOR TEN CONTINUOUS YEARS ONE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND STRONG LITERALLY TERRORIZING THE SKY
AshrafGhani_2005G@710.58:722.79 EVERY AFGHAN SEES THE SKY AS A SOURCE OF FEAR WE WERE BOMBED PRACTICALLY OUT OF EXISTENCE
AshrafGhani_2005G@724.22:731.25 THEN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE TRAINED IN TERRORISM FROM ALL SIDES
AshrafGhani_2005G@741.28:748.96 HOW TO TURN A BICYCLE INTO AN INSTRUMENT OF TERROR HOW TO TURN A DONKEY A CART HORSE ANYTHING
AshrafGhani_2005G@749.40:757.30 AND THE RUSSIANS EQUALLY SO WHEN VIOLENCE ERUPTS IN A COUNTRY LIKE AFGHANISTAN IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT LEGACY
AshrafGhani_2005G@757.85:767.02 BUT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE'VE BEEN INCREDIBLY LUCKY I MEAN I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE HOW LUCKY I AM HERE STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU SPEAKING
AshrafGhani_2005G@767.43:777.01 WHEN I JOINED AS FINANCE MINISTER I THOUGHT THAT THE CHANCES OF MY LIVING MORE THAN THREE YEARS WOULD NOT BE MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT
AshrafGhani_2005G@787.08:796.63 YOU SEE BECAUSE I MEAN I GIVE YOU ONE STATISTIC NINETY ONE PERCENT OF THE MEN IN AFGHANISTAN EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF THE WOMEN LISTEN TO AT LEAST THREE RADIO STATIONS
AshrafGhani_2005G@799.32:806.02 IN TERMS OF THEIR DISCOURSE IN TERMS OF THEIR SOPHISTICATION OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD I THINK THAT I
AshrafGhani_2005G@807.27:817.36 MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN RURAL AMERICANS WITH COLLEGE DEGREES AND THE BULK OF EUROPEANS
AshrafGhani_2005G@819.28:828.82 BECAUSE THE WORLD MATTERS TO THEM AND WHAT IS THEIR PREDOMINANT CONCERN ABANDONMENT AFGHANS HAVE BECOME DEEPLY INTERNATIONALIST
AshrafGhani_2005G@829.19:839.12 YOU KNOW WHEN I WENT BACK IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND ONE I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO DESIRE TO WORK WITH THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT BECAUSE I'D LIVED AS A NATIONALIST AND I TOLD THEM MY PEOPLE WITH THE AMERICANS HERE
AshrafGhani_2005G@840.48:852.62 SEPARATE YES I HAVE AN ADVISORY POSITION WITH THE U N I WENT THROUGH TEN AFGHAN PROVINCES VERY RAPIDLY AND EVERYBODY WAS TELLING ME IT WAS A DIFFERENT WORLD YOU KNOW THEY ENGAGE THEY SEE ENGAGEMENT
AshrafGhani_2005G@853.22:867.10 GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT AS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO THE FUTURE OF THE ORDINARY PEOPLE AND THE THING THAT THE ORDINARY AFGHAN IS MOST CONCERNED WITH IS CLARE LOCKHART IS HERE SO I'LL RECITE A DISCUSSION SHE HAD WITH AN ILLITERATE WOMAN IN NORTHERN AFGHANISTAN
AshrafGhani_2005G@867.59:880.38 AND THAT WOMAN SAID SHE DIDN'T CARE WHETHER SHE HAD FOOD ON HER TABLE WHAT SHE WORRIED ABOUT WAS WHETHER THERE WAS A PLAN FOR THE FUTURE WHERE HER CHILDREN COULD REALLY HAVE A DIFFERENT LIFE THAT GIVES ME HOPE
AshrafGhani_2005G@881.30:889.02 HOW IS AFGHANISTAN GOING TO PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE INCOME TO THE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING THEIR LIVING OFF THE DRUGS TRADE
AshrafGhani_2005G@890.84:898.90 THE FIRST IS INSTEAD OF SENDING A BILLION DOLLARS ON DRUG ERADICATION AND PAYING IT TO A COUPLE OF SECURITY COMPANIES
AshrafGhani_2005G@899.26:910.88 THEY SHOULD GIVE THIS HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS TO FIFTY OF THE MOST CRITICALLY INNOVATIVE COMPANIES IN THE WORLD TO ASK THEM TO CREATE ONE MILLION JOBS
AshrafGhani_2005G@912.53:919.95 TO THE DRUG ERADICATION IS JOBS LOOK THERE'S A VERY LITTLE KNOWN FACT COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A LEGAL AVERAGE INCOME PER CAPITA OF ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS DON'T PRODUCE DRUGS
AshrafGhani_2005G@935.54:942.58 IF YOU WANT US TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH CHINA AND TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT WE COULD PROBABLY ATTRACT FOUR TO SIX BILLION DOLLARS
AshrafGhani_2005G@955.80:963.83 AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT'S THE VALUE CHAIN LOOK AND THE ORDINARY AFGHAN IS SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT MICROCREDIT
AshrafGhani_2005G@964.80:975.79 IT IS IMPORTANT BUT WHAT THE ORDINARY WOMEN AND MEN WHO ENGAGE IN MICRO PRODUCTION WANT IS GLOBAL ACCESS THEY DON'T WANT TO SELL TO THE CHARITY BAZAARS
AshrafGhani_2005G@977.22:988.73 THAT ARE ONLY FOR FOREIGNERS AND THE SAME BLOODY SHIRT EMBROIDERED TIME AND AGAIN WHAT WE WANT IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ITALIAN DESIGN FIRMS
AshrafGhani_2005G@990.35:996.50 WE HAVE THE BEST EMBROIDERERS IN THE WORLD WHY CAN'T WE DO WHAT WAS DONE WITH NORTHERN ITALY WITH THE PUT OUT
AshrafGhani_2005G@999.35:1009.61 SO I THINK ECONOMICALLY THE CRITICAL ISSUE REALLY IS TO NOW THINK THROUGH AND WHAT I WILL SAY HERE IS THAT AID DOESN'T WORK YOU KNOW THE AID SYSTEM IS BROKEN
AshrafGhani_2005G@1010.53:1017.76 THE AID SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE THE VISION THE ABILITY I'M ALL FOR IT AFTER ALL I RAISED A LOT OF
AshrafGhani_2005G@1018.63:1031.25 TO BE EXACT YOU KNOW I MANAGED TO PERSUADE THE WORLD THEY HAD TO GIVE MY COUNTRY TWENTY SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE US THE MONEY CA AND IT STILL DIDN'T WORK AG NO IT'S NOT THAT IT DIDN'T WORK IT'S THAT A DOLLAR OF PRIVATE
AshrafGhani_2005G@1033.34:1041.09 IN MY JUDGMENT IS EQUAL AT LEAST TO TWENTY DOLLARS OF AID IN TERMS OF THE DYNAMIC THAT IT GENERATES SECOND IS THAT
AshrafGhani_2005G@1041.33:1050.93 ONE DOLLAR OF AID COULD BE TEN CENTS IT COULD BE TWENTY CENTS OR IT COULD BE FOUR DOLLARS IT DEPENDS ON WHAT FORM IT COMES WHAT DEGREES OF CONDITIONALITIES ARE ATTACHED TO IT
AshrafGhani_2005G@1051.69:1060.84 THE AID SYSTEM AT FIRST WAS DESIGNED TO BENEFIT ENTREPRENEURS OF THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES NOT TO GENERATE GROWTH IN THE POOR COUNTRIES
AshrafGhani_2005G@1061.53:1068.11 AND THIS IS AGAIN ONE OF THOSE ASSUMPTIONS THE WAY CAR SEATS ARE AN ASSUMPTION THAT WE'VE INHERITED IN GOVERNMENTS AND
AshrafGhani_2005G@1068.95:1079.08 YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE US GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT THINK THAT AMERICAN FIRMS NEEDED SUBSIDIZING TO FUNCTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES PROVIDE ADVICE BUT THEY DO
AshrafGhani_2005G@1080.39:1090.24 AN ENTIRE WEIGHT OF HISTORY VIS A VIS AID THAT NOW NEEDS TO BE REEXAMINED IF THE GOAL IS TO BUILD STATES THAT CAN CREDIBLY
AshrafGhani_2005G@1090.47:1097.13 TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND I'M PUTTING THAT PROPOSITION EQUALLY YOU KNOW I'M VERY HARSH ON MY COUNTERPARTS
AshrafGhani_2005G@1101.06:1108.31 IN EACH COUNTRY IN A DEFINABLE PERIOD AND EVERY YEAR THERE MUST BE PROGRESS ON MOBILIZATION OF DOMESTIC
AshrafGhani_2005G@1109.10:1116.68 REVENUE AND GENERATION OF THE ECONOMY UNLESS THAT KIND OF COMPACT IS ENTERED INTO YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THE
