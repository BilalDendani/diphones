LizaDonnelly_2010W I WAS AFRAID OF WOMANHOOD
LizaDonnelly_2010W NOT THAT I'M NOT AFRAID NOW BUT I'VE LEARNED
LizaDonnelly_2010W THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES WHEN I WAS GROWING UP LITTLE GIRLS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE KIND AND THOUGHTFUL AND PRETTY AND GENTLE AND SOFT AND WE WERE SUPPOSED TO FIT INTO ROLES THAT WERE SORT OF SHADOWY
LizaDonnelly_2010W REALLY NOT QUITE CLEAR WHAT
LizaDonnelly_2010W THERE WERE PLENTY OF ROLE MODELS ALL AROUND US WE HAD OUR MOTHERS OUR
LizaDonnelly_2010W SISTERS AND OF COURSE THE EVER PRESENT MEDIA BOMBARDING US WITH IMAGES AND WORDS TELLING US HOW TO BE
LizaDonnelly_2010W NOW MY MOTHER WAS DIFFERENT
LizaDonnelly_2010W SHE WAS A HOMEMAKER BUT SHE AND I DIDN'T GO OUT AND DO GIRLIE THINGS TOGETHER AND SHE DIDN'T BUY ME PINK OUTFITS INSTEAD SHE KNEW WHAT I NEEDED AND SHE BOUGHT ME A BOOK OF CARTOONS AND I JUST ATE IT UP
LizaDonnelly_2010W I DREW AND I DREW AND SINCE I KNEW THAT HUMOR WAS ACCEPTABLE IN MY FAMILY I COULD DRAW DO WHAT I WANTED TO DO AND NOT HAVE TO PERFORM
LizaDonnelly_2010W SPEAK I WAS VERY SHY AND I COULD STILL GET APPROVAL
LizaDonnelly_2010W I WAS LAUNCHED AS A CARTOONIST
LizaDonnelly_2010W NOW WHEN WE'RE YOUNG WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WE KNOW THERE ARE RULES OUT THERE BUT WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW
LizaDonnelly_2010W EVEN THOUGH WE ARE IMPRINTED AT BIRTH
LizaDonnelly_2010W WITH THESE THINGS
LizaDonnelly_2010W WE'RE TOLD WHAT THE MOST IMPORTANT COLOR IN THE WORLD IS
LizaDonnelly_2010W TOLD WHAT SHAPE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
LizaDonnelly_2010W TOLD
LizaDonnelly_2010W NOW THE RULES THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT ARE CONSTANTLY BEING MONITORED BY THE
LizaDonnelly_2010W CULTURE WE'RE BEING CORRECTED AND THE PRIMARY POLICEMEN ARE WOMEN BECAUSE WE ARE THE CARRIERS OF THE TRADITION WE PASS IT DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION
LizaDonnelly_2010W NOT ONLY WE ALWAYS HAVE THIS VAGUE NOTION THAT SOMETHING 'S EXPECTED OF US AND ON TOP OF ALL OFF THESE RULES
LizaDonnelly_2010W THEY KEEP CHANGING
LizaDonnelly_2010W WE
LizaDonnelly_2010W DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HALF THE TIME SO IT PUTS US IN A VERY TENUOUS POSITION
LizaDonnelly_2010W NOW IF YOU DON'T LIKE THESE RULES
LizaDonnelly_2010W AND MANY OF US DON'T I KNOW I
LizaDonnelly_2010W AND I STILL DON 'T EVEN THOUGH I FOLLOW THEM HALF THE TIME NOT QUITE AWARE THAT I'M FOLLOWING THEM WHAT BETTER WAY THAN TO CHANGE THEM WITH HUMOR
LizaDonnelly_2010W IT TAKES WHAT WE KNOW AND IT TWISTS IT IT TAKES THE CODES OF BEHAVIOR AND THE CODES OF DRESS AND IT MAKES IT UNEXPECTED AND THAT'S WHAT ELICITS A LAUGH
LizaDonnelly_2010W NOW WHAT IF YOU PUT TOGETHER WOMEN AND HUMOR I THINK YOU CAN GET CHANGE BECAUSE WOMEN ARE ON THE GROUND FLOOR
LizaDonnelly_2010W AND WE KNOW THE TRADITIONS SO WELL WE CAN BRING A DIFFERENT VOICE TO THE TABLE NOW I STARTED DRAWING IN THE MIDDLE OF A LOT OF CHAOS
LizaDonnelly_2010W I GREW UP NOT FAR FROM HERE IN WASHINGTON D C DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THE ASSASSINATIONS THE WATERGATE HEARINGS AND THEN THE FEMINIST MOVEMENT AND I THINK I WAS DRAWING TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND THEN ALSO MY FAMILY WAS IN CHAOS
LizaDonnelly_2010W AND I DREW TO TRY TO BRING MY
LizaDonnelly_2010W WHEN I WAS A LITTLE OLDER IN MY
LizaDonnelly_2010W I REALIZED THERE ARE NOT MANY WOMEN IN CARTOONING AND I THOUGHT WELL MAYBE I CAN BREAK THE LITTLE GLASS CEILING OF CARTOONING AND SO I DID I BECAME A CARTOONIST AND THEN I THOUGHT
LizaDonnelly_2010W IN MY FORTIES I STARTED THINKING WELL WHY DON'T I DO SOMETHING I ALWAYS LOVED POLITICAL CARTOONS SO WHY DON'T I DO SOMETHING WITH THE CONTENT OF MY CARTOONS TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE STUPID RULES THAT WE'RE FOLLOWING AS WELL AS LAUGH
LizaDonnelly_2010W NOW MY
LizaDonnelly_2010W IS A PARTICULARLY AMERICAN PERSPECTIVE I CAN'T HELP IT I LIVE HERE EVEN THOUGH I'VE TRAVELED A LOT I STILL THINK LIKE AN AMERICAN
LizaDonnelly_2010W BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE RULES THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT ARE UNIVERSAL OF COURSE THAT EACH CULTURE HAS ITS DIFFERENT CODES OF BEHAVIOR AND DRESS AND TRADITIONS
LizaDonnelly_2010W AND EACH WOMAN HAS TO DEAL WITH THESE SAME THINGS THAT WE DO HERE IN THE U S CONSEQUENTLY WE HAVE WOMEN BECAUSE WE'RE ON THE GROUND WE KNOW THE TRADITION WE HAVE AMAZING ANTENNA
LizaDonnelly_2010W NOW MY WORK LATELY HAS BEEN TO COLLABORATE WITH INTERNATIONAL CARTOONISTS WHICH I SO ENJOY AND IT'S GIVEN ME A GREATER APPRECIATION FOR THE POWER OF CARTOONS TO
LizaDonnelly_2010W GET AT THE TRUTH TO GET AT THE ISSUES QUICKLY AND SUCCINCTLY AND NOT ONLY THAT IT CAN GET TO THE VIEWER THROUGH NOT ONLY THE INTELLECT BUT THROUGH THE HEART
LizaDonnelly_2010W MY WORK ALSO HAS ALLOWED ME TO COLLABORATE WITH WOMEN CARTOONISTS FROM ACROSS THE WORLD COUNTRIES SUCH AS SAUDI ARABIA IRAN
LizaDonnelly_2010W TURKEY ARGENTINA FRANCE AND WE HAVE
LizaDonnelly_2010W TOGETHER AND LAUGHED AND TALKED AND SHARED OUR DIFFICULTIES AND THESE WOMEN ARE WORKING SO HARD TO GET THEIR VOICES HEARD IN SOME VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES BUT I FEEL BLESSED TO BE
LizaDonnelly_2010W WE TALK ABOUT HOW WOMEN HAVE SUCH STRONG PERCEPTIONS BECAUSE OF OUR TENUOUS POSITION AND OUR ROLE AS TRADITION KEEPERS THAT WE CAN HAVE THE GREAT POTENTIAL TO BE CHANGE AGENTS
LizaDonnelly_2010W AND I THINK I TRULY BELIEVE THAT WE CHANGE THIS THING
