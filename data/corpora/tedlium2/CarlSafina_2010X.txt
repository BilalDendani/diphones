CarlSafina_2010X THE OCEAN AS I USED TO KNOW
CarlSafina_2010X AND I FIND THAT SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE GULF A COUPLE OF TIMES I REALLY KIND OF AM TRAUMATIZED BECAUSE WHENEVER I LOOK AT THE OCEAN NOW NO MATTER WHERE I AM
CarlSafina_2010X EVEN WHERE I KNOW NONE OF THE OIL HAS GONE I SORT OF SEE SLICKS AND I'M FINDING THAT I'M VERY MUCH HAUNTED
CarlSafina_2010X BY IT
CarlSafina_2010X BUT WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT TRY TO PUT ALL OF THIS IN CONTEXT NOT JUST ABOUT THE OIL ERUPTION BUT
CarlSafina_2010X WHAT IT MEANS AND WHY IT HAS HAPPENED FIRST JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME I'M BASICALLY JUST A GUY THAT LIKES TO GO FISHING EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID
CarlSafina_2010X AND BECAUSE I DID I WOUND UP STUDYING SEA BIRDS TO TRY TO STAY IN THE COASTAL HABITATS THAT I SO LOVED
CarlSafina_2010X AND NOW I MAINLY WRITE BOOKS ABOUT HOW THE OCEAN IS CHANGING AND THE OCEAN IS CERTAINLY CHANGING VERY RAPIDLY NOW WE SAW THIS KIND OF GRAPHIC EARLIER ON
CarlSafina_2010X THAT WE REALLY LIVE ON A HARD MARBLE THAT HAS JUST A SLIGHT BIT OF WETNESS TO IT IT'S LIKE YOU DIPPED A MARBLE IN WATER
CarlSafina_2010X AND THE SAME THING WITH THE ATMOSPHERE IF YOU TOOK ALL THE ATMOSPHERE AND ROLLED IT UP IN A BALL YOU WOULD GET THAT LITTLE SPHERE OF GAS ON THE RIGHT SO WE LIVE
CarlSafina_2010X ON THE MOST FRAGILE LITTLE SOAP BUBBLE YOU CAN IMAGINE A VERY SACRED SOAP BUBBLE BUT ONE THAT IS VERY VERY EASY TO EFFECT AND ALL THE BURNING OF OIL AND COAL AND GAS
CarlSafina_2010X ALL THE FOSSIL FUELS HAVE CHANGED THE ATMOSPHERE GREATLY CARBON DIOXIDE LEVEL HAS GONE UP AND UP AND UP WE'RE WARMING THE CLIMATE
CarlSafina_2010X SO THE BLOWOUT IN THE GULF IS JUST A LITTLE PIECE OF A MUCH LARGER PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WITH THE ENERGY THAT WE USE TO RUN CIVILIZATION
CarlSafina_2010X BEYOND WARMING WE HAVE THE PROBLEM OF THE OCEANS GETTING MORE ACIDIFIED AND ALREADY MEASURABLY SO AND ALREADY EFFECTING ANIMALS
CarlSafina_2010X NOW IN THE LABORATORY IF YOU TAKE A CLAM AND YOU PUT IT IN THE PH THAT IS NOT EIGHT POINT ONE WHICH IS THE NORMAL PH OF SEAWATER BUT
CarlSafina_2010X SEVEN POINT FIVE IT DISSOLVES IN ABOUT THREE DAYS IF YOU TAKE SEA URCHIN LARVA FROM EIGHT POINT ONE
CarlSafina_2010X PUT IT IN A PH OF SEVEN POINT SEVEN NOT A HUGE CHANGE IT BECOMES DEFORMED AND DIES AND ALREADY
CarlSafina_2010X CORAL REEFS ARE GROWING SLOWER IN SOME PLACES BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM SO THIS REALLY MATTERS NOW LET 'S TAKE A LITTLE TOUR AROUND THE GULF A LITTLE BIT
CarlSafina_2010X THINGS THAT REALLY IMPRESSES ME ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THE GULF THEY ARE REALLY REALLY AQUATIC PEOPLE AND THEY CAN HANDLE WATER THEY CAN HANDLE A HURRICANE THAT COMES AND GOES WHEN THE WATER GOES DOWN THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO
CarlSafina_2010X BUT WHEN IT'S SOMETHING OTHER THAN WATER AND THEIR WATER HABITAT CHANGES THEY DON'T HAVE MANY OPTIONS IN FACT THOSE ENTIRE COMMUNITIES REALLY DON'T HAVE
CarlSafina_2010X MANY OPTIONS THEY DON'T HAVE ANOTHER THING THEY CAN DO THEY CAN'T GO AND WORK IN THE LOCAL HOTEL BUSINESS BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ONE IN THEIR COMMUNITY
CarlSafina_2010X IF YOU GO TO THE GULF AND YOU LOOK AROUND YOU DO SEE A LOT OF OIL YOU SEE A LOT OF OIL ON THE OCEAN YOU SEE A LOT OF OIL ON THE SHORELINE IF YOU GO TO THE SITE OF THE BLOWOUT
CarlSafina_2010X IT LOOKS PRETTY UNBELIEVABLE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU JUST EMPTIED THE OIL PAN IN YOUR CAR AND YOU JUST DUMPED IT IN THE OCEAN AND ONE OF THE REALLY MOST INCREDIBLE THINGS I THINK
CarlSafina_2010X IS THAT THERE'S NOBODY OUT THERE TRYING TO COLLECT IT AT THE SITE WHERE IT IS DENSEST PARTS OF THE OCEAN THERE LOOK JUST ABSOLUTELY APOCALYPTIC
CarlSafina_2010X YOU GO IN ALONG THE SHORE YOU CAN FIND IT EVERYWHERE IT'S REALLY MESSY IF YOU GO TO THE PLACES WHERE IT'S JUST ARRIVING LIKE THE EASTERN PART OF THE GULF IN ALABAMA
CarlSafina_2010X THERE'S STILL PEOPLE USING THE BEACH WHILE THERE ARE PEOPLE CLEANING UP THE BEACH AND THEY HAVE A VERY STRANGE WAY OF CLEANING UP THE BEACH THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO PUT MORE THAN TEN LBS OF
CarlSafina_2010X YOU SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY SHELL SHOCKED THEY ARE VERY HARDWORKING PEOPLE ALL THEY KNOW ABOUT LIFE IS THEY GET UP IN THE MORNING AND IF THEIR ENGINE STARTS THEY GO TO WORK
CarlSafina_2010X THEY ALWAYS FELT THAT THEY COULD RELY ON THE ASSURANCES THAT NATURE BROUGHT THEM THROUGH THE ECOSYSTEM OF THE GULF AND THEY'RE FINDING THAT THEIR WORLD IS REALLY COLLAPSING AND SO YOU CAN SEE LITERALLY SIGNS OF
CarlSafina_2010X THEIR SHOCK SIGNS OF THEIR OUTRAGE SIGNS OF THEIR ANGER
CarlSafina_2010X AND SIGNS OF THEIR GRIEF THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN SEE
CarlSafina_2010X AND
CarlSafina_2010X AND I LEARNED IN FACT I CONFIRMED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT OIL AND WATER DON'T MIX UNTIL YOU ADD A DISPERSANT
CarlSafina_2010X AND THEN
CarlSafina_2010X THEY START MIXING AND YOU ADD A LITTLE ENERGY FROM THE WIND AND THE WAVES AND YOU GET A BIG MESS
CarlSafina_2010X A BIG MESS THAT YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY CLEAN YOU CAN'T TOUCH YOU CAN'T EXTRACT AND I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS IS WHAT I THINK
CarlSafina_2010X YOU CAN'T SEE IT I THINK IT'S BEING HIDDEN ON PURPOSE NOW THIS IS SUCH A CATASTROPHE AND SUCH A MESS
CarlSafina_2010X THAT LOTS OF STUFF IS LEAKING OUT ON THE EDGES OF THE INFORMATION STREAM BUT AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID THERE'S A LARGE ATTEMPT TO SUPPRESS WHAT'S GOING ON PERSONALLY I THINK THAT
CarlSafina_2010X DISPERSANTS ARE A MAJOR STRATEGY TO HIDE THE BODY BECAUSE WE PUT THE MURDERER IN CHARGE OF THE CRIME SCENE
CarlSafina_2010X BUT YOU CAN SEE IT YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE OIL IS CONCENTRATED AT THE SURFACE AND THEN IT IS ATTACKED BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE EVIDENCE IN MY OPINION OKAY
CarlSafina_2010X WE HEARD THAT BACTERIA EAT OIL SO DO SEA TURTLES WHEN IT BREAKS UP IT HAS A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE IT GETS DOWN TO BACTERIA
CarlSafina_2010X TURTLES EAT IT IT GETS IN THE GILLS OF FISH THESE GUYS HAVE TO SWIM AROUND THROUGH IT I HEARD THE MOST INCREDIBLE STORY TODAY WHEN I WAS ON THE TRAIN COMING HERE A WRITER NAMED TED WILLIAMS CALLED ME
CarlSafina_2010X AND HE WAS ASKING ME A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT I SAW BECAUSE HE 'S WRITING AN ARTICLE FOR AUDUBON MAGAZINE HE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN IN THE GULF A LITTLE WHILE AGO LIKE ABOUT A WEEK AGO AND
CarlSafina_2010X A GUY WHO HAD BEEN A RECREATIONAL FISHING GUIDE TOOK HIM OUT TO SHOW HIM WHAT'S GOING ON THAT GUIDE 'S ENTIRE CALENDAR YEAR IS
CarlSafina_2010X TED THAT ON THE LAST DAY HE WENT OUT A BOTTLENOSED DOLPHIN SUDDENLY APPEARED NEXT TO THE BOAT AND IT WAS SPLATTERING OIL OUT ITS BLOWHOLE
CarlSafina_2010X AND HE
CarlSafina_2010X NOW IN THE EXXON VALDEZ SPILL ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE KILLER WHALES
CarlSafina_2010X DIED IN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS THEIR NUMBERS HAVE NEVER RECOVERED SO THE RECOVERY RATE OF ALL THIS STUFF IS GOING TO BE VARIABLE IT'S GOING TO TAKE
CarlSafina_2010X SO THE GULF IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF WATER MORE IMPORTANT THAN A SIMILAR VOLUME OF WATER IN THE OPEN ATLANTIC OCEAN
CarlSafina_2010X VERY MUCH RIGHT IN THE AREA OF THE SLICK THEY'RE PROBABLY HAVING AT THE VERY LEAST A CATASTROPHIC SPAWNING SEASON THIS YEAR I'M HOPING THAT MAYBE THE ADULTS ARE AVOIDING THAT DIRTY WATER
CarlSafina_2010X THEY DON'T USUALLY LIKE TO GO INTO WATER THAT IS VERY CLOUDY ANYWAY BUT THESE ARE REALLY HIGH PERFORMANCE ATHLETIC ANIMALS
CarlSafina_2010X I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS KIND OF STUFF WILL DO IN THEIR GILLS I DON'T KNOW IF IT'LL EFFECT THE ADULTS IF IT'S NOT IT'S CERTAINLY EFFECTING THEIR EGGS AND LARVAE I WOULD CERTAINLY THINK
CarlSafina_2010X I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WE'VE DONE A LOT TO EFFECT WHAT'S IN THE OCEAN FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE STARTING WITH SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN OKAY WE'RE STARTING WITH SOMETHING THAT'S HAD A LOT OF STRESSES AND A LOT OF PROBLEMS
CarlSafina_2010X TO BEGIN WITH IF YOU LOOK AROUND AT THE BIRDS THERE ARE A LOT OF BIRDS IN THE GULF THAT CONCENTRATE IN THE GULF AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR BUT THEN LEAVE AND THEY POPULATE MUCH LARGER AREAS
CarlSafina_2010X SO FOR INSTANCE MOST OF THE BIRDS IN THIS PICTURE ARE MIGRATORY BIRDS THEY WERE ALL ON THE GULF IN MAY WHILE OIL WAS STARTING TO COME ASHORE IN CERTAIN PLACES
CarlSafina_2010X DOWN ON THE LOWER LEFT THERE ARE RUDDY TURNSTONES AND SANDERLINGS THEY BREED IN THE HIGH ARCTIC AND THEY WINTER DOWN IN SOUTHERN SOUTH AMERICA BUT THEY
CarlSafina_2010X SO THIS IS A HEMISPHERIC ISSUE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS GO AT LEAST NATIONALLY IN MANY WAYS THE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS ARE CERTAINLY HEMISPHERIC
CarlSafina_2010X I THINK THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST ABSOLUTELY MINDBOGGLING EXAMPLES OF TOTAL UNPREPAREDNESS THAT I CAN EVEN THINK OF EVEN WHEN
CarlSafina_2010X THE JAPANESE BOMBED PEARL HARBOR AT LEAST THEY SHOT BACK AND WE JUST SEEM TO BE UNABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO THERE WAS NOTHING READY
CarlSafina_2010X AND YOU KNOW AS WE CAN SEE BY WHAT THEY'RE DOING MAINLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS BOOMS AND DISPERSANTS THE BOOMS ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT
CarlSafina_2010X MADE FOR OPEN WATER THEY DON'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO CORRAL THE OIL WHERE IT IS MOST CONCENTRATED THEY GET NEAR SHORE LOOK AT THESE TWO BOATS THAT ONE ON THE RIGHT IS CALLED FISHING FOOL
CarlSafina_2010X AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT'S A GREAT NAME FOR BOATS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO MAKE A DENT IN THIS BY DRAGGING A BOOM BETWEEN THEM WHEN THERE ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SQUARE MILES
CarlSafina_2010X IN THE GULF RIGHT NOW WITH OIL AT THE SURFACE THE DISPERSANTS MAKE THE OIL GO RIGHT UNDER THE BOOMS THE BOOMS ARE ONLY ABOUT THIRTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER
CarlSafina_2010X SO IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY CRAZY HERE ARE SHRIMP BOATS EMPLOYED THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF SHRIMP BOATS EMPLOYED TO DRAG BOOMS INSTEAD OF NETS HERE THEY ARE WORKING
CarlSafina_2010X YOU CAN SEE EASILY THAT ALL THE OILY WATER JUST GOES OVER THE BACK OF THE BOOM ALL THEY'RE DOING IS STIRRING IT IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS
CarlSafina_2010X ALSO FOR ALL THE SHORELINE THAT HAS BOOMS HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF MILES OF SHORELINE ALL OF THE SHORELINE THAT HAS BOOMS THERE'S ADJACENT SHORELINE THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY BOOMS THERE IS AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR
CarlSafina_2010X OIL AND DIRTY WATER TO GET IN BEHIND THEM AND THAT LOWER PHOTO THAT'S A BIRD COLONY THAT HAS BEEN BOOMED EVERYBODY 'S TRYING TRYING TO PROTECT
CarlSafina_2010X THE BIRD COLONIES THERE WELL AS AN ORNITHOLOGIST I CAN TELL YOU THAT BIRDS FLY AND THAT
CarlSafina_2010X AND THAT BOOMING A BIRD COLONY DOESN'T DO IT IT DOESN'T DO IT THESE BIRDS MAKE A LIVING BY DIVING INTO THE WATER
CarlSafina_2010X IN FACT
CarlSafina_2010X REALLY WHAT I THINK THEY SHOULD DO IF ANYTHING THEY'RE TRYING SO HARD TO PROTECT THOSE NESTS ACTUALLY IF THEY DESTROYED EVERY SINGLE NEST SOME OF THE BIRDS WOULD LEAVE AND THAT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THEM THIS YEAR
CarlSafina_2010X AS FAR AS CLEANING THEM I DON'T MEAN TO CAST ANY ASPERSION ON PEOPLE CLEANING BIRDS
CarlSafina_2010X IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE EXPRESS OUR COMPASSION I THINK THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT PEOPLE HAVE IS COMPASSION
CarlSafina_2010X IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET THOSE IMAGES AND TO SHOW IT BUT REALLY WHERE ARE THOSE BIRDS GOING TO GET RELEASED TO
CarlSafina_2010X IT'S LIKE TAKING SOMEBODY OUT OF A BURNING BUILDING TREATING THEM FOR SMOKE INHALATION AND SENDING THEM BACK INTO THE BUILDING BECAUSE THE OIL IS STILL GUSHING
CarlSafina_2010X TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS AS ANYTHING LIKE AN ACCIDENT I THINK THAT THIS IS THE RESULT OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE
CarlSafina_2010X NOT JUST B P B P OPERATED VERY
CarlSafina_2010X AND VERY RECKLESSLY BECAUSE THEY COULD AND THEY WERE ALLOWED TO DO SO BECAUSE OF THE ABSOLUTE FAILURE OF OVERSIGHT OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE OUR GOVERNMENT PROTECTING US
CarlSafina_2010X IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU SEE THIS SIGN ON ALMOST EVERY COMMERCIAL VESSEL IN THE UNITED STATES YOU KNOW IF YOU SPILLED A COUPLE OF GALLONS OF OIL YOU WOULD BE IN BIG TROUBLE AND YOU HAVE TO REALLY WONDER WHO ARE THE LAWS
CarlSafina_2010X MADE FOR AND WHO HAS GOTTEN ABOVE THE LAWS NOW THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IN THE FUTURE WE COULD HAVE THE KINDS OF EQUIPMENT THAT WE WOULD REALLY NEED
CarlSafina_2010X IT WOULD NOT TAKE AN AWFUL LOT TO ANTICIPATE THAT AFTER MAKING THIRTY THOUSAND HOLES IN THE SEA FLOOR OF THE GULF OF MEXICO LOOKING FOR OIL
CarlSafina_2010X OIL MIGHT START COMING OUT OF ONE OF THEM AND YOU'D HAVE SOME IDEA OF WHAT TO DO THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THIS LEAK REALLY STARTED FROM
CarlSafina_2010X IT REALLY STARTED FROM THE DESTRUCTION OF THE IDEA THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS THERE BECAUSE IT'S OUR GOVERNMENT MEANT TO PROTECT THE LARGER PUBLIC INTEREST
CarlSafina_2010X SO I THINK THAT THE OIL BLOWOUT THE BANK BAILOUT THE MORTGAGE CRISIS AND ALL THESE THINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY SYMPTOMS OF THE SAME CAUSE
CarlSafina_2010X WE STILL SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT AT LEAST WE NEED THE POLICE TO PROTECT US FROM A FEW BAD PEOPLE AND EVEN THOUGH THE POLICE CAN BE A LITTLE ANNOYING AT TIMES GIVING US TICKETS AND STUFF LIKE THAT NOBODY SAYS THAT
CarlSafina_2010X WE SHOULD JUST GET RID OF THEM BUT IN THE ENTIRE REST OF GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW AND FOR THE LAST AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A CULTURE OF DEREGULATION THAT IS CAUSED DIRECTLY
CarlSafina_2010X BY THE PEOPLE WHO WE NEED TO BE PROTECTED FROM BUYING THE GOVERNMENT OUT FROM UNDER US
CarlSafina_2010X COMPLAINED THAT THEY WERE ALREADY BIDDING DEFIANCE TO THE LAWS OF OUR COUNTRY
CarlSafina_2010X THEY WOULD TELL THESE CORPORATIONS TO GO TO HELL THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD REALLY MEAN TO BE CONSERVATIVE
CarlSafina_2010X SO WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS REGAIN THE IDEA THAT IT'S OUR GOVERNMENT
CarlSafina_2010X I THINK THERE ARE SIGNS OF HOPE WE SEEM TO BE WAKING UP A LITTLE BIT THE GLASS STEAGALL ACT WHICH WAS REALLY TO PROTECT US FROM THE KIND OF THING THAT CAUSED THE RECESSION TO HAPPEN
CarlSafina_2010X NOW THERE'S A MOOD TO PUT SOME OF THAT STUFF BACK IN PLACE BUT THE LOBBYISTS ARE ALL READY THERE TRYING TO WEAKEN THE REGULATIONS
CarlSafina_2010X AFTER THE LEGISLATION HAS JUST PASSED SO IT'S A CONTINUED FIGHT IT'S A HISTORIC MOMENT RIGHT NOW WE'RE EITHER GOING TO HAVE AN ABSOLUTELY UNMITIGATED CATASTROPHE OF THIS OIL LEAK IN THE GULF OR WE WILL MAKE THE MOMENT WE NEED
CarlSafina_2010X OUT OF THIS AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE NOTED TODAY THERE'S CERTAINLY A COMMON THEME ABOUT NEEDING TO MAKE THE MOMENT OUT OF THIS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE WITH OTHER WAYS OF OFFSHORE DRILLING THE FIRST
CarlSafina_2010X NOW ARE WE STUCK WITH THIS EVER SINCE WE LIVED IN CAVES EVERY TIME WE WANTED ANY ENERGY WE LIT SOMETHING ON FIRE AND THAT IS STILL WHAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE STILL LIGHTING SOMETHING ON FIRE EVERY TIME
CarlSafina_2010X WE WANT ENERGY AND PEOPLE SAY WE CAN'T HAVE CLEAN ENERGY BECAUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE
CarlSafina_2010X WHO SAYS IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE PEOPLE WHO SELL US FOSSIL FUELS WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE WITH ENERGY AND PEOPLE SAYING THE ECONOMY CANNOT WITHSTAND A SWITCH BECAUSE THE CHEAPEST ENERGY
CarlSafina_2010X WAS SLAVERY ENERGY IS ALWAYS A MORAL ISSUE IT'S AN ISSUE THAT IS MORAL RIGHT NOW IT'S A MATTER OF RIGHT AND WRONG THANK YOU VERY MUCH
