LucianneWalkowicz_2011G SYSTEMS OUTSIDE OUR OWN ARE LIKE DISTANT CITIES WHOSE LIGHTS WE CAN SEE TWINKLING BUT WHOSE STREETS WE CAN 'T WALK BY STUDYING THOSE TWINKLING LIGHTS THOUGH WE CAN LEARN ABOUT HOW STARS AND PLANETS INTERACT TO FORM THEIR OWN ECOSYSTEM AND MAKE HABITATS THAT ARE AMENABLE TO LIFE
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G AND WHAT WE 'RE LOOKING FOR IS THE TINY DIMMING OF LIGHT THAT IS CAUSED BY A PLANET PASSING IN FRONT OF ONE OF THESE STARS AND BLOCKING SOME OF THAT STARLIGHT FROM GETTING TO US
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G IN JUST OVER TWO YEARS OF OPERATIONS WE 'VE FOUND OVER ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED POTENTIAL NEW PLANETARY SYSTEMS AROUND OTHER STARS TO GIVE YOU SOME PERSPECTIVE IN THE PREVIOUS TWO DECADES OF SEARCHING WE HAD ONLY KNOWN ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED PRIOR TO KEPLER
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G WHEN WE SEE THESE LITTLE DIPS IN THE LIGHT WE CAN DETERMINE A NUMBER OF THINGS FOR ONE THING WE CAN DETERMINE THAT THERE 'S A PLANET THERE BUT ALSO HOW BIG THAT PLANET IS AND HOW FAR IT IS AWAY FROM ITS PARENT STAR
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G HOWEVER THERE 'S MORE TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR PARENT STAR THAN JUST HOW MUCH LIGHT YOU RECEIVE OVERALL AND I 'LL TELL YOU WHY
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G THIS IS OUR STAR THIS IS OUR SUN IT 'S SHOWN HERE IN VISIBLE LIGHT THAT 'S THE LIGHT THAT YOU CAN SEE WITH YOUR OWN HUMAN EYES YOU 'LL NOTICE THAT IT LOOKS PRETTY MUCH LIKE THE ICONIC YELLOW BALL THAT SUN THAT WE ALL DRAW WHEN WE 'RE CHILDREN BUT YOU 'LL NOTICE SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT 'S THAT THE FACE OF THE SUN HAS FRECKLES
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G THESE FRECKLES ARE CALLED SUNSPOTS AND THEY ARE JUST ONE OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SUN 'S MAGNETIC FIELD THEY ALSO CAUSE THE LIGHT FROM THE STAR TO VARY AND WE CAN MEASURE THIS VERY VERY PRECISELY WITH KEPLER AND TRACE THEIR EFFECTS HOWEVER
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G THESE ARE JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG IF WE HAD UV EYES OR X RAY EYES WE WOULD REALLY SEE THE DYNAMIC AND DRAMATIC EFFECTS OF OUR SUN 'S MAGNETIC ACTIVITY THE KIND OF THING THAT HAPPENS ON OTHER STARS AS WELL
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G JUST THINK EVEN WHEN IT 'S CLOUDY OUTSIDE THESE KIND OF EVENTS ARE HAPPENING IN THE SKY ABOVE YOU ALL THE TIME
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G SO WHEN WE WANT TO LEARN WHETHER A PLANET IS HABITABLE WHETHER IT MIGHT BE AMENABLE TO LIFE WE WANT TO KNOW NOT ONLY HOW MUCH TOTAL LIGHT IT RECEIVES AND HOW WARM IT IS
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G THE UV AND THE X RAYS THAT ARE CREATED BY ITS STAR AND THAT BATHE IT IN THIS BATH OF HIGH ENERGY RADIATION
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G AND SO WE CAN 'T REALLY LOOK AT PLANETS AROUND OTHER STARS IN THE SAME KIND OF DETAIL THAT WE CAN LOOK AT PLANETS IN OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM I 'M SHOWING HERE VENUS EARTH AND MARS THREE PLANETS IN OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM THAT ARE ROUGHLY THE SAME SIZE BUT ONLY ONE OF WHICH IS REALLY A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IN THE MEANTIME IS MEASURE THE LIGHT FROM OUR STARS
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G AND LEARN ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PLANETS AND THEIR PARENT STARS TO SUSS OUT CLUES ABOUT WHICH PLANETS MIGHT BE GOOD PLACES TO LOOK FOR LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G KEPLER WON 'T FIND A PLANET AROUND EVERY SINGLE STAR IT LOOKS AT BUT REALLY EVERY MEASUREMENT IT MAKES IS PRECIOUS
