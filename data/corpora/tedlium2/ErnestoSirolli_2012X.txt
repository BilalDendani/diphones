ErnestoSirolli_2012X WE WESTERN PEOPLE
ErnestoSirolli_2012X OR WE ARE PATERNALISTIC THE TWO WORDS COME FROM THE LATIN ROOT PATER WHICH MEANS FATHER BUT THEY MEAN TWO DIFFERENT THINGS
ErnestoSirolli_2012X I WAS GIVEN A SLAP IN THE FACE READING
ErnestoSirolli_2012X ABOVE ALL IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
ErnestoSirolli_2012X THIS SHOULD BE THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF AID THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF AID IS RESPECT THIS MORNING THE GENTLEMAN WHO OPENED THIS CONFERENCE LAY A STICK ON THE FLOOR AND SAID CAN WE CAN YOU IMAGINE A CITY THAT IS NOT NEOCOLONIAL
ErnestoSirolli_2012X WHEN I WAS TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD
ErnestoSirolli_2012X TO ONLY RESPOND TO PEOPLE
ErnestoSirolli_2012X AND I INVENTED A SYSTEM CALLED ENTERPRISE FACILITATION WHERE YOU NEVER INITIATE ANYTHING YOU NEVER MOTIVATE ANYBODY BUT YOU BECOME A SERVANT OF THE LOCAL PASSION THE SERVANT OF LOCAL PEOPLE WHO HAVE A DREAM TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON
ErnestoSirolli_2012X SO WHAT YOU DO YOU SHUT UP YOU NEVER ARRIVE IN A COMMUNITY WITH ANY IDEAS AND YOU SIT
ErnestoSirolli_2012X WITH THE LOCAL PEOPLE WE DON 'T WORK FROM OFFICES WE MEET AT THE CAFE WE MEET AT THE PUB WE HAVE ZERO INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHAT WE DO
ErnestoSirolli_2012X WE BECOME FRIENDS AND WE FIND OUT WHAT THAT PERSON WANTS TO DO THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS PASSION YOU CAN GIVE SOMEBODY AN IDEA IF THAT PERSON DOESN 'T WANT TO DO IT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
ErnestoSirolli_2012X THE PERSON WITH THE IDEA MAY NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE BUT THE KNOWLEDGE IS AVAILABLE SO YEARS AND YEARS AGO
ErnestoSirolli_2012X I HAD THIS IDEA WHY DON 'T WE FOR ONCE INSTEAD OF ARRIVING IN THE COMMUNITY TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO DO
ErnestoSirolli_2012X WHY DON 'T FOR ONCE LISTEN TO THEM BUT NOT IN COMMUNITY MEETINGS LET ME
ErnestoSirolli_2012X WITH COMMUNITY MEETINGS ENTREPRENEURS NEVER COME
ErnestoSirolli_2012X AND THEY NEVER TELL YOU IN A PUBLIC MEETING WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THEIR OWN MONEY
ErnestoSirolli_2012X WHAT WE DO WE WORK ONE ON ONE
ErnestoSirolli_2012X AND TO WORK ONE ON ONE YOU HAVE TO CREATE A SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT DOESN 'T EXIST YOU HAVE TO CREATE A NEW PROFESSION
ErnestoSirolli_2012X THE PROFESSION IS THE FAMILY DOCTOR OF ENTERPRISE THE FAMILY DOCTOR OF BUSINESS WHO SITS WITH YOU IN YOUR HOUSE AT YOUR KITCHEN TABLE AT THE CAFE AND HELPS YOU FIND THE RESOURCES TO TRANSFORM YOUR PASSION INTO A WAY TO MAKE A LIVING
ErnestoSirolli_2012X I STARTED THIS AS A TRYOUT IN ESPERANCE IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA I WAS A DOING A PH D AT THE TIME TRYING TO GO AWAY FROM THIS PATRONIZING BULLSHIT THAT WE ARRIVE AND TELL YOU WHAT TO DO
ErnestoSirolli_2012X AND SO WHAT I DID IN ESPERANCE THAT FIRST YEAR WAS TO JUST WALK THE STREETS AND IN THREE DAYS I HAD MY FIRST CLIENT AND I HELPED THIS FIRST GUY WHO WAS SMOKING FISH FROM A GARAGE WAS A MAORI GUY

ErnestoSirolli_2012X HOW TO GET THESE PEOPLE TO COME AND TALK TO YOU YOU HAVE TO OFFER THEM
ErnestoSirolli_2012X CONFIDENTIALITY PRIVACY YOU HAVE TO BE FANTASTIC AT HELPING THEM
ErnestoSirolli_2012X AND THEN THEY WILL COME AND THEY WILL COME IN DROVES IN A COMMUNITY OF TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WE GET TWO HUNDRED CLIENTS CAN YOU IMAGINE A COMMUNITY OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THE INTELLIGENCE AND THE PASSION WHICH PRESENTATION HAVE YOU APPLAUDED THE MOST THIS MORNING LOCAL PASSIONATE PEOPLE

ErnestoSirolli_2012X GOVERNMENT FORGET ABOUT IT
ErnestoSirolli_2012X THERE 'S A LOVELY STORY THAT I READ IN A FUTURIST MAGAZINE MANY MANY YEARS AGO THERE WAS A GROUP OF EXPERTS WHO WERE INVITED TO DISCUSS THE FUTURE OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY
ErnestoSirolli_2012X AND IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER AND THEY ALL SPECULATED ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AND THE CONCLUSION WAS UNANIMOUS THE CITY OF NEW YORK WOULD NOT EXIST IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS WHY BECAUSE THEY LOOKED AT THE CURVE AND SAID IF THE POPULATION KEEPS GROWING AT THIS RATE

ErnestoSirolli_2012X HOWEVER THERE IS A SECRET
ErnestoSirolli_2012X TO WORK WITH ENTREPRENEURS FIRST YOU HAVE TO OFFER THEM CONFIDENTIALITY OTHERWISE THEY DON 'T COME AND TALK TO YOU
ErnestoSirolli_2012X THEN YOU HAVE TO OFFER THEM ABSOLUTE DEDICATED PASSIONATE SERVICE TO THEM AND THEN YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM THE TRUTH ABOUT ENTREPRENEURSHIP
ErnestoSirolli_2012X THE SMALLEST COMPANY THE BIGGEST COMPANY HAS TO BE CAPABLE OF DOING THREE THINGS BEAUTIFULLY
ErnestoSirolli_2012X THE PRODUCT THAT YOU WANT TO SELL HAS TO BE FANTASTIC YOU HAVE TO HAVE FANTASTIC MARKETING AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE TREMENDOUS FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT GUESS WHAT
ErnestoSirolli_2012X WE HAVE NEVER MET A SINGLE HUMAN BEING IN THE WORLD WHO CAN MAKE IT SELL IT AND LOOK AFTER THE MONEY
