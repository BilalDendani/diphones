ErnestoSirolli_2012X@299.28:302.23 ABOVE ALL IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
ErnestoSirolli_2012X@307.44:326.82 THIS SHOULD BE THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF AID THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF AID IS RESPECT THIS MORNING THE GENTLEMAN WHO OPENED THIS CONFERENCE LAY A STICK ON THE FLOOR AND SAID CAN WE CAN YOU IMAGINE A CITY THAT IS NOT NEOCOLONIAL
ErnestoSirolli_2012X@330.47:333.19 WHEN I WAS TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD
ErnestoSirolli_2012X@333.32:336.68 TO ONLY RESPOND TO PEOPLE
ErnestoSirolli_2012X@336.68:356.52 AND I INVENTED A SYSTEM CALLED ENTERPRISE FACILITATION WHERE YOU NEVER INITIATE ANYTHING YOU NEVER MOTIVATE ANYBODY BUT YOU BECOME A SERVANT OF THE LOCAL PASSION THE SERVANT OF LOCAL PEOPLE WHO HAVE A DREAM TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON
ErnestoSirolli_2012X@356.52:367.35 SO WHAT YOU DO YOU SHUT UP YOU NEVER ARRIVE IN A COMMUNITY WITH ANY IDEAS AND YOU SIT
ErnestoSirolli_2012X@367.35:380.59 WITH THE LOCAL PEOPLE WE DON 'T WORK FROM OFFICES WE MEET AT THE CAFE WE MEET AT THE PUB WE HAVE ZERO INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHAT WE DO
ErnestoSirolli_2012X@380.63:394.59 WE BECOME FRIENDS AND WE FIND OUT WHAT THAT PERSON WANTS TO DO THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS PASSION YOU CAN GIVE SOMEBODY AN IDEA IF THAT PERSON DOESN 'T WANT TO DO IT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
ErnestoSirolli_2012X@416.83:424.58 THE PERSON WITH THE IDEA MAY NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE BUT THE KNOWLEDGE IS AVAILABLE SO YEARS AND YEARS AGO
ErnestoSirolli_2012X@424.91:432.15 I HAD THIS IDEA WHY DON 'T WE FOR ONCE INSTEAD OF ARRIVING IN THE COMMUNITY TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO DO
ErnestoSirolli_2012X@432.15:441.1 WHY DON 'T FOR ONCE LISTEN TO THEM BUT NOT IN COMMUNITY MEETINGS LET ME
ErnestoSirolli_2012X@446.8:451.39 WITH COMMUNITY MEETINGS ENTREPRENEURS NEVER COME
ErnestoSirolli_2012X@452.62:459.7 AND THEY NEVER TELL YOU IN A PUBLIC MEETING WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THEIR OWN MONEY
ErnestoSirolli_2012X@480.66:484.2 WHAT WE DO WE WORK ONE ON ONE
ErnestoSirolli_2012X@484.2:491.72 AND TO WORK ONE ON ONE YOU HAVE TO CREATE A SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT DOESN 'T EXIST YOU HAVE TO CREATE A NEW PROFESSION
ErnestoSirolli_2012X@491.72:510.08 THE PROFESSION IS THE FAMILY DOCTOR OF ENTERPRISE THE FAMILY DOCTOR OF BUSINESS WHO SITS WITH YOU IN YOUR HOUSE AT YOUR KITCHEN TABLE AT THE CAFE AND HELPS YOU FIND THE RESOURCES TO TRANSFORM YOUR PASSION INTO A WAY TO MAKE A LIVING
ErnestoSirolli_2012X@510.08:525.55 I STARTED THIS AS A TRYOUT IN ESPERANCE IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA I WAS A DOING A PH D AT THE TIME TRYING TO GO AWAY FROM THIS PATRONIZING BULLSHIT THAT WE ARRIVE AND TELL YOU WHAT TO DO
ErnestoSirolli_2012X@525.55:542.28 AND SO WHAT I DID IN ESPERANCE THAT FIRST YEAR WAS TO JUST WALK THE STREETS AND IN THREE DAYS I HAD MY FIRST CLIENT AND I HELPED THIS FIRST GUY WHO WAS SMOKING FISH FROM A GARAGE WAS A MAORI GUY

ErnestoSirolli_2012X@763.03:781.16 AND IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER AND THEY ALL SPECULATED ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AND THE CONCLUSION WAS UNANIMOUS THE CITY OF NEW YORK WOULD NOT EXIST IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS WHY BECAUSE THEY LOOKED AT THE CURVE AND SAID IF THE POPULATION KEEPS GROWING AT THIS RATE
