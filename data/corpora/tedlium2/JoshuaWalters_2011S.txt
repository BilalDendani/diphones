JoshuaWalters_2011S WALTERS I 'M A PERFORMER
JoshuaWalters_2011S WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN IN SAN FRANCISCO I HAD MY BREAKTHROUGH MANIC EPISODE IN WHICH I THOUGHT I WAS JESUS CHRIST
JoshuaWalters_2011S MAYBE YOU THOUGHT THAT WAS SCARY BUT ACTUALLY THERE 'S NO AMOUNT OF DRUGS YOU CAN TAKE THAT CAN GET YOU AS HIGH AS IF YOU THINK YOU 'RE JESUS CHRIST
JoshuaWalters_2011S I WAS SENT TO A PLACE A PSYCH WARD AND IN THE PSYCH WARD EVERYONE IS DOING THEIR OWN ONE MAN SHOW
JoshuaWalters_2011S THERE 'S NO AUDIENCE LIKE THIS TO JUSTIFY THEIR REHEARSAL TIME
JoshuaWalters_2011S THEY 'RE JUST PRACTICING ONE DAY THEY 'LL GET HERE
JoshuaWalters_2011S THE FIRST HALF OF HIGH SCHOOL WAS THE STRUGGLE OF THE MANIC EPISODE AND THE SECOND HALF WAS THE OVERMEDICATIONS OF THESE DRUGS WHERE I WAS SLEEPING THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL THE SECOND HALF WAS JUST ONE BIG NAP PRETTY MUCH IN CLASS
JoshuaWalters_2011S WHEN I GOT OUT I HAD A CHOICE I COULD EITHER DENY MY MENTAL ILLNESS OR
JoshuaWalters_2011S THERE 'S A MOVEMENT GOING ON RIGHT NOW
JoshuaWalters_2011S TO REFRAME MENTAL ILLNESS AS A POSITIVE AT LEAST THE HYPOMANIC EDGE PART OF IT NOW IF YOU DON 'T KNOW WHAT HYPOMANIA IS IT 'S LIKE AN ENGINE THAT 'S OUT OF CONTROL MAYBE A FERRARI ENGINE WITH NO BREAKS MANY OF THE SPEAKERS HERE MANY OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE HAVE THAT CREATIVE EDGE IF YOU KNOW WHAT I 'M TALKING ABOUT
JoshuaWalters_2011S YOU 'RE DRIVEN TO DO SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE HAS TOLD YOU IS IMPOSSIBLE AND THERE 'S A BOOK JOHN GARTNER JOHN GARTNER WROTE THIS BOOK CALLED THE HYPOMANIC EDGE IN WHICH CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS AND TED TURNER AND STEVE JOBS AND ALL THESE BUSINESS MINDS HAVE THIS EDGE TO COMPETE
JoshuaWalters_2011S A DIFFERENT BOOK WAS WRITTEN NOT TOO LONG AGO IN THE MID NINETY S CALLED TOUCHED WITH FIRE BY KAY REDFIELD JAMISON IN WHICH IT WAS LOOKED AT IN A CREATIVE SENSE IN WHICH MOZART AND BEETHOVEN AND VAN GOGH ALL HAVE THIS MANIC DEPRESSION THAT THEY WERE SUFFERING WITH SOME OF THEM COMMITTED SUICIDE
JoshuaWalters_2011S SO IT WASN 'T ALL THE GOOD SIDE OF THE ILLNESS NOW RECENTLY THERE 'S BEEN
JoshuaWalters_2011S DEVELOPMENT IN THIS FIELD AND THERE WAS AN ARTICLE WRITTEN IN THE NEW YORK TIMES SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THAT STATED
JoshuaWalters_2011S MAYBE THEY JUST MAKE YOU A LOT OF MONEY
JoshuaWalters_2011S YOUR CALL YOUR CALL AND EVERYONE 'S SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE
JoshuaWalters_2011S EVERYONE 'S SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE
JoshuaWalters_2011S SO MAYBE
JoshuaWalters_2011S HOW MUCH DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU FALL IN THE SPECTRUM
