JuliaSweeney_2006@13.47:25.72 TEN THE MORNING OF MY SEVENTH BIRTHDAY I CAME DOWNSTAIRS TO THE KITCHEN WHERE MY MOTHER WAS WASHING THE DISHES AND MY FATHER WAS READING THE PAPER OR SOMETHING AND I SORT OF PRESENTED MYSELF TO THEM IN THE DOORWAY AND THEY SAID
JuliaSweeney_2006@54.60:66.96 THIS PHRASE AGE OF REASON BEFORE SISTER MARY KEVIN HAD BEEN BANDYING IT ABOUT MY SECOND GRADE CLASS AT SCHOOL BUT WHEN SHE SAID IT THE PHRASE SEEMED ALL CAUGHT UP IN THE EXCITEMENT OF PREPARATIONS FOR OUR FIRST COMMUNION AND OUR FIRST CONFESSION
JuliaSweeney_2006@67.79:75.40 KNEW THAT WAS REALLY ALL ABOUT THE WHITE DRESS AND THE WHITE VEIL AND ANYWAY I HADN'T REALLY PAID ALL THAT MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT PHRASE AGE OF REASON
JuliaSweeney_2006@75.96:78.85 SO I SAID YEAH YEAH AGE OF REASON

JuliaSweeney_2006@207.45:217.14 AND MY POOR PARENTS WERE TRYING TO PROTECT US FROM THE EMBARRASSMENT THIS HUMILIATION OF REJECTION BY SANTA WHO WAS JOLLY BUT LET 'S FACE IT HE WAS ALSO VERY JUDGMENTAL
JuliaSweeney_2006@217.54:224.85 SO TO FIND OUT THAT THERE WAS NO SANTA CLAUS AT ALL WAS ACTUALLY SORT OF A RELIEF I LEFT THE KITCHEN NOT REALLY IN SHOCK ABOUT SANTA

JuliaSweeney_2006@401.59:410.76 AROUND THE TIME THAT I STARTED FILLING OUT PHYSICALLY AND I WAS FILLING OUT A LOT MORE THAN A LOT OF THE OTHER GIRLS AND FRANKLY THE WHOLE IDEA THAT MY ASTROLOGICAL SIGN WAS A SCALE
JuliaSweeney_2006@411.15:412.51 SEEMED OMINOUS AND
JuliaSweeney_2006@421.62:424.46 AND I WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT IT WAS ALSO
JuliaSweeney_2006@427.67:429.40 IT WASN'T UNTIL YEARS LATER LOOKING
JuliaSweeney_2006@429.55:433.70 BACK ON THIS WHOLE AGE OF REASON CHANGE OF BIRTHDAY THING THAT IT DAWNED ON ME I
JuliaSweeney_2006@436.77:443.04 OTHER MONTH TO DO ANYTHING I WANTED TO BEFORE GOD STARTED KEEPING TABS ON ME OH LIFE CAN BE SO
JuliaSweeney_2006@446.63:456.54 TWO MORMON MISSIONARIES CAME TO MY DOOR NOW I JUST LIVE OFF A MAIN THOROUGHFARE IN LOS ANGELES AND MY BLOCK IS WELL IT'S A NATURAL BEGINNING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE PEDDLING THINGS DOOR TO DOOR
JuliaSweeney_2006@470.98:480.22 SO NORMALLY I JUST IGNORE THE DOORBELL BUT ON THIS DAY I ANSWERED AND THERE STOOD TWO BOYS EACH ABOUT NINETEEN IN WHITE STARCHED SHORT SLEEVED SHIRTS
JuliaSweeney_2006@480.61:488.70 AND THEY HAD LITTLE NAME TAGS THAT IDENTIFIED THEM AS OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS AND THEY SAID THEY HAD A MESSAGE FOR ME
JuliaSweeney_2006@489.38:495.79 FROM GOD I SAID A MESSAGE FOR ME FROM GOD AND THEY SAID YES
JuliaSweeney_2006@496.28:506.89 NOW I WAS RAISED IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST AROUND A LOT OF CHURCH OF LATTER DAY SAINTS PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW I'VE WORKED WITH THEM AND EVEN DATED THEM BUT I NEVER REALLY KNEW THE DOCTRINE OR WHAT THEY SAID TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE OUT ON A MISSION
JuliaSweeney_2006@507.20:514.33 I GUESS I WAS SORT OF CURIOUS SO I SAID WELL PLEASE COME IN AND THEY LOOKED REALLY HAPPY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THIS HAPPENS TO THEM ALL THAT
JuliaSweeney_2006@516.68:520.29 AND I SAT THEM DOWN AND I GOT THEM GLASSES OF WATER
JuliaSweeney_2006@531.98:534.36 I GOT THEM GLASSES OF WATER DON'T TOUCH MY HAIR THAT'S THE
JuliaSweeney_2006@541.89:544.07 ME NOT TO FIX MY HAIR OK
JuliaSweeney_2006@555.82:564.46 AND I THOUGHT WELL OF COURSE I BELIEVE IN GOD BUT YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE THAT WORD HEART BECAUSE IT ANTHROPOMORPHIZES GOD AND
JuliaSweeney_2006@564.99:574.47 I DON'T LIKE THE WORD HIS EITHER BECAUSE THAT SEXUALIZES GOD BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO ARGUE SEMANTICS WITH THESE BOYS SO AFTER A VERY LONG UNCOMFORTABLE PAUSE I SAID
JuliaSweeney_2006@575.41:582.45 YES YES I DO I FEEL VERY LOVED AND THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SMILED LIKE THAT WAS THE RIGHT ANSWER
JuliaSweeney_2006@609.47:619.90 AND GOD CAME TO LEHI AND SAID TO HIM PUT YOUR FAMILY ON A BOAT AND I WILL LEAD YOU OUT OF HERE AND GOD DID LEAD THEM HE LED THEM TO AMERICA I SAID
JuliaSweeney_2006@624.76:628.09 BY BOAT IN SIX HUNDRED BC AND THEY SAID
JuliaSweeney_2006@631.68:638.99 TOLD ME HOW LEHI AND HIS DESCENDANTS REPRODUCED AND REPRODUCED AND OVER THE COURSE OF SIX HUNDRED YEARS THERE WERE TWO GREAT RACES OF THEM THE NEPHITES AND THE
JuliaSweeney_2006@656.77:665.08 THAT IF THEY ALL REMAINED TOTALLY TOTALLY GOOD EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM THEY WOULD WIN THE WAR AGAINST THE EVIL LAMANITES BUT APPARENTLY SOMEBODY
JuliaSweeney_2006@689.88:693.02 I WAS JUST ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT
JuliaSweeney_2006@698.61:701.28 AND THEY SAID WELL THEY BECAME OUR NATIVE AMERICANS HERE IN THE
JuliaSweeney_2006@702.51:712.76 I SAID SO YOU BELIEVE THE NATIVE AMERICANS ARE DESCENDED FROM A PEOPLE WHO WERE TOTALLY EVIL AND THEY SAID YES THEN THEY TOLD ME HOW THIS GUY NAMED JOSEPH SMITH
JuliaSweeney_2006@713.89:723.77 THOSE BURIED GOLD PLATES RIGHT IN HIS BACKYARD AND HE ALSO FOUND THIS MAGIC STONE BACK THERE THAT HE PUT INTO HIS HAT AND THEN BURIED HIS FACE INTO AND THIS ALLOWED HIM TO TRANSLATE THE GOLD PLATES
JuliaSweeney_2006@724.01:731.28 FROM THE REFORMED EGYPTIAN INTO ENGLISH WELL AT THIS POINT I JUST WANTED TO GIVE THESE TWO BOYS SOME ADVICE ABOUT THEIR
JuliaSweeney_2006@738.47:740.35 DON'T START WITH THIS STORY
JuliaSweeney_2006@741.28:746.39 I MEAN EVEN THE SCIENTOLOGISTS KNOW TO START WITH A PERSONALITY TEST BEFORE THEY START
JuliaSweeney_2006@754.05:762.55 SAID DO YOU BELIEVE THAT GOD SPEAKS TO US THROUGH HIS RIGHTEOUS PROPHETS AND I SAID NO I DON 'T BECAUSE I WAS SORT OF UPSET ABOUT THIS LAMANITE STORY AND THIS CRAZY GOLD PLATE STORY
JuliaSweeney_2006@762.85:772.71 BUT THE TRUTH WAS I HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT THIS THROUGH SO I BACKPEDALED A LITTLE AND I SAID WELL WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU MEAN BY RIGHTEOUS AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PROPHETS LIKE
JuliaSweeney_2006@772.82:779.17 COULD THE PROPHETS BE WOMEN AND THEY SAID NO AND I SAID WHY AND THEY SAID WELL
JuliaSweeney_2006@779.63:784.32 BECAUSE GOD GAVE WOMEN A GIFT THAT IS SO SPECTACULAR IT IS SO
JuliaSweeney_2006@785.89:796.88 THE ONLY GIFT HE HAD LEFT OVER TO GIVE MEN WAS THE GIFT OF PROPHECY WHAT IS THIS WONDERFUL GIFT GOD GAVE WOMEN I WONDERED MAYBE THEIR GREATER ABILITY TO COOPERATE AND
JuliaSweeney_2006@798.70:799.91 WOMEN 'S LONGER LIFESPAN
JuliaSweeney_2006@800.08:810.49 THE FACT THAT WOMEN TEND TO BE MUCH LESS VIOLENT THAN MEN BUT NO IT WASN'T ANY OF THESE GIFTS THEY SAID WELL IT'S HER ABILITY TO BEAR CHILDREN I SAID OH COME ON I MEAN
JuliaSweeney_2006@828.10:836.00 SO FRESH FACED AND CUTE TO ME ANY MORE BUT THEY HAD MORE TO SAY THEY SAID WELL WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IF YOU'RE A MORMON AND IF YOU'RE IN GOOD STANDING WITH THE CHURCH
JuliaSweeney_2006@836.17:842.79 WHEN YOU DIE YOU GET TO GO TO HEAVEN AND BE WITH YOUR FAMILY FOR ALL ETERNITY AND I SAID OH
JuliaSweeney_2006@850.78:854.86 THAT WOULDN'T BE SUCH A GOOD INCENTIVE FOR ME AND THEY SAID
JuliaSweeney_2006@857.76:867.11 WELL WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU GO TO HEAVEN YOU GET YOUR BODY RESTORED TO YOU IN ITS BEST ORIGINAL STATE LIKE IF YOU'D LOST A LEG WELL YOU GET IT BACK OR IF YOU'D GONE BLIND YOU COULD SEE
JuliaSweeney_2006@867.47:878.24 I SAID OH NOW I DON'T HAVE A UTERUS BECAUSE I HAD CANCER A FEW YEARS AGO SO DOES THIS MEAN THAT IF I WENT TO HEAVEN I WOULD GET MY OLD UTERUS BACK AND THEY SAID SURE
JuliaSweeney_2006@884.69:886.48 WHAT IF YOU HAD A NOSE JOB
JuliaSweeney_2006@893.72:902.68 GAVE ME THIS BOOK OF MORMON AND THEY TOLD ME TO READ THIS CHAPTER AND THAT CHAPTER AND THEY SAID THEY'D COME BACK SOME DAY AND CHECK IN ON ME AND I THINK I SAID SOMETHING LIKE PLEASE DON'T HURRY OR MAYBE IT WAS JUST PLEASE DON 'T AND THEY
JuliaSweeney_2006@904.22:910.20 OK SO I INITIALLY FELT REALLY SUPERIOR TO THESE BOYS AND SMUG IN MY MORE CONVENTIONAL FAITH
JuliaSweeney_2006@929.31:930.55 HAD A BABY AND
JuliaSweeney_2006@930.88:936.45 THAT'S THE SON OF GOD I MEAN I WOULD THINK THAT'S EQUALLY RIDICULOUS I'M JUST SO USED TO THAT STORY
JuliaSweeney_2006@948.45:959.22 BECAUSE I WASN'T EXACTLY SURE HOW I FELT ABOUT THAT QUESTION NOW IF THEY'D ASKED ME DO YOU FEEL THAT GOD LOVES YOU WITH ALL HIS HEART WELL THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH DIFFERENT I THINK I WOULD HAVE INSTANTLY ANSWERED
JuliaSweeney_2006@959.70:967.03 YES YES I FEEL IT ALL THE TIME I FEEL GOD 'S LOVE WHEN I'M HURT AND CONFUSED AND I FEEL CONSOLED AND CARED FOR
JuliaSweeney_2006@967.48:975.39 I TAKE SHELTER IN GOD 'S LOVE WHEN I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY TRAGEDY HITS AND I FEEL GOD 'S LOVE WHEN I LOOK WITH GRATITUDE AT ALL THE BEAUTY I SEE
JuliaSweeney_2006@976.48:984.60 ASKED ME THAT QUESTION WITH THE WORD BELIEVE IN IT SOMEHOW IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT BECAUSE I WASN'T EXACTLY SURE IF I BELIEVED WHAT I SO CLEARLY FELT
