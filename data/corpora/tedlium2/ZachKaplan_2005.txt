ZachKaplan_2005@21.22:30.29 OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS WE FOUND OVER TWO HUNDRED OF THESE THINGS AND SO WE LOOKED BACK INTO OUR LIBRARY AND SELECTED SIX WE THOUGHT WOULD BE MOST SURPRISING FOR TED
ZachKaplan_2005@32.41:42.52 OF THESE SIX THE FIRST ONE THAT WE 'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS IN THE BLACK ENVELOPE YOU 'RE HOLDING IT COMES FROM A COMPANY IN JAPAN CALLED GELTECH NOW GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT UP
ZachKaplan_2005@47.64:49.91 BE SURE AND TAKE THE TWO PIECES APART
ZachKaplan_2005@51.61:54.46 WHAT 'S UNEXPECTED ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT 'S SOFT
ZachKaplan_2005@54.66:67.69 BUT IT 'S ALSO A STRONG MAGNET ZACH AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED OBSERVING UNEXPECTED THINGS LIKE THIS WE SPENT A LONG TIME THINKING ABOUT WHY THIS IS AND IT 'S JUST RECENTLY THAT WE REALIZED
ZachKaplan_2005@73.18:83.02 AS YOU 'RE SEEING THIS GEL MAGNET FOR THE FIRST TIME IF YOU ASSUME THAT ALL MAGNETS HAD TO BE HARD THEN SEEING THIS SURPRISED YOU AND IT CHANGED YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAY MAGNETS COULD WORK
ZachKaplan_2005@95.12:97.35 SO A FIRST IDEA IS TO USE
ZachKaplan_2005@108.7:120.83 IMAGINE TAKING THE SAME MATERIAL BUT PUTTING IT ON THE BOTTOM OF A SNEAKER YOU KNOW THIS WAY YOU COULD GO TO THE CONTAINER STORE AND BUY ONE OF THOSE METAL SHEETS THAT THEY HANG ON THE BACK OF YOUR DOOR IN YOUR CLOSET AND YOU COULD LITERALLY STICK
ZachKaplan_2005@120.88:123.32 YOUR SHOES UP INSTEAD OF USING A SHELF
ZachKaplan_2005@165.37:171.03 AND YOU COULD SEE IT IN HIS FACE ROMAN STARTS TO GET REALLY EXCITED AND HE WHIPS OUT THIS MANILA FOLDER
ZachKaplan_2005@176.69:180.76 THESE THINGS JUST GET HIM REALLY EXCITED AND SO WE 'RE LOOKING AT THESE CONCEPTS
ZachKaplan_2005@203.25:206.71 AND AS WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT MORE WE REALIZED THAT IT LET YOU FILL IN ALL THE DETAILS
ZachKaplan_2005@206.8:210.45 ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE JUST AS IF YOU SAW IT ON TV
ZachKaplan_2005@210.88:217.16 SO FOR TED WE DECIDED TO TAKE OUR FAVORITE IDEA FOR THE GEL MAGNET AND WORK WITH ROMAN AND HIS TEAM AT THE DIRECTORS BUREAU
ZachKaplan_2005@267.35:269.46 SO I JUST WANT TO QUICKLY EXPLAIN HOW THIS WOULD WORK
ZachKaplan_2005@269.71:281.39 THIS IS THE MAGNETICALLY LEVITATING BOARD THAT THEY MENTIONED IN THE COMMERCIAL THE GEL THAT YOU 'RE HOLDING WOULD BE LINING THE BOTTOM OF THE BOARD NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR TWO REASONS ONE THE SOFT PROPERTIES OF THE MAGNET THAT MAKE IT SO THAT IF IT WERE TO HIT THE RIDER IN THE HEAD
ZachKaplan_2005@281.39:295.7 IT WOULDN 'T INJURE HIM IN ADDITION YOU CAN SEE FROM THE DIAGRAM ON THE RIGHT THE UNDERPART OF THE SLIDE WOULD BE AN ELECTROMAGNET SO THIS WOULD ACTUALLY REPEL THE RIDER A LITTLE BIT AS YOU 'RE GOING DOWN THE FORCE OF THE WATER RUSHING DOWN IN ADDITION TO THAT REPULSION FORCE WOULD MAKE THIS SLIDE GO FASTER THAN ANY SLIDE ON THE MARKET
ZachKaplan_2005@295.7:299.56 IT 'S BECAUSE OF THIS THAT YOU NEED THE MAGNETIC BRAKING SYSTEM
ZachKaplan_2005@312.86:319.48 BUT SOMETHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENS WHEN YOU DROP A MAGNET DOWN AN ALUMINUM TUBE SO WE SET UP A QUICK EXPERIMENT HERE TO SHOW THAT TO YOU
ZachKaplan_2005@337.43:339.95 NOW YOU SEE THE MAGNET FELL REALLY SLOWLY
ZachKaplan_2005@368.68:370.47 TO HOLD ANY POSITION IN BETWEEN
ZachKaplan_2005@392.55:399.2 IN OUR BRAINSTORMS WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA YOU COULD USE IT FOR A SOCCER GOAL SO AT THE END OF THE GAME YOU JUST ROLL UP THE GOAL AND PUT IT IN YOUR GYM BAG
ZachKaplan_2005@410.84:416.7 WE DECIDED TO GO OUT ONTO THE STREETS OF CHICAGO AND ASK A FEW PEOPLE ON THE STREETS WHAT THEY THOUGHT YOU COULD DO WITH THIS
ZachKaplan_2005@464.95:467.08 WE NEED YOU TO STAND RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE TED SIGN
ZachKaplan_2005@506.51:509.38 SO DESCRIBE TO THE AUDIENCE
ZachKaplan_2005@509.38:511.37 THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SHIRT GO AHEAD
ZachKaplan_2005@521.05:523.05 IT 'S ODORLESS IT 'S COLORLESS
ZachKaplan_2005@523.39:526.13 IT 'S SO SAFE YOU COULD DRINK THIS STUFF
ZachKaplan_2005@550.99:558.14 WHAT 'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS DRY LIQUID EARLY VERSIONS OF THE FLUID WERE ACTUALLY USED ON A CRAY SUPERCOMPUTER
ZachKaplan_2005@558.15:571.03 NOW THE UNEXPECTED THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT ZACH COULD STAND UP ON STAGE AND DRENCH A PERFECTLY INNOCENT MEMBER OF THE AUDIENCE WITHOUT ANY CONCERN THAT WE 'D DAMAGE THE ELECTRONICS THAT WE 'D GET HIM WET THAT WE 'D HURT THE BOOKS OR THE COMPUTERS
ZachKaplan_2005@571.03:587.82 IT WORKS BECAUSE IT 'S NON CONDUCTIVE SO YOU CAN SEE HERE YOU CAN IMMERSE A WHOLE CIRCUIT BOARD IN THIS AND IT WOULDN 'T CAUSE ANY DAMAGE YOU CAN CIRCULATE IT TO DRAW THE HEAT AWAY BUT TODAY IT 'S MOST WIDELY USED IN OFFICE BUILDINGS IN THE SPRINKLER SYSTEM AS A FIRE SUPPRESSION FLUID AGAIN IT 'S PERFECTLY SAFE FOR PEOPLE IT PUTS OUT THE FIRES DOESN 'T HURT ANYTHING
ZachKaplan_2005@587.9:596.99 BUT OUR FAVORITE IDEA FOR THIS WAS USING IT IN A BASKETBALL GAME SO DURING HALFTIME IT COULD RAIN DOWN ON THE PLAYERS COOL EVERYONE DOWN AND IN A MATTER OF MINUTES IT WOULD DRY WOULDN 'T HURT THE COURT
ZachKaplan_2005@602.13:606.2 ONE OF THEIR R D ENGINEERS WAS WORKING ON A WAY TO MAKE PLASTIC STIFFER
ZachKaplan_2005@636.01:637.84 SO YOU SEE THERE IT DIDN 'T BOUNCE BACK
ZachKaplan_2005@644.38:656.76 NOW THINK ABOUT YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH ALUMINUM FOIL SHAPE RETAINING IS COMMON IN METAL YOU BEND A PIECE OF ALUMINUM FOIL AND IT HOLDS ITS PLACE CONTRAST THAT WITH A PLASTIC GARBAGE CAN AND YOU CAN PUSH IN THE SIDES AND IT ALWAYS BOUNCES BACK
ZachKaplan_2005@664.18:677.72 TAKING IT A LITTLE FURTHER IF YOU WOVE THOSE STRIPS TOGETHER KIND OF LIKE A LITTLE BASKET YOU COULD MAKE A SHAPE RETAINING SHEET AND THEN YOU COULD EMBED IT IN A CLOTH SO YOU COULD MAKE A PICNIC SHEET THAT WRAPS AROUND THE TABLE SO THAT WAY ON A WINDY DAY IT WOULDN 'T BLOW AWAY
ZachKaplan_2005@678.05:686.12 FOR OUR NEXT TECHNOLOGY IT 'S HARD TO OBSERVE THE UNEXPECTED PROPERTY BY ITSELF BECAUSE IT 'S AN INK SO WE 'VE PREPARED A VIDEO TO SHOW IT APPLIED TO PAPER
ZachKaplan_2005@698.47:700.48 NOW TO THINK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS
ZachKaplan_2005@700.64:709.16 THINK OF ALL THE PLACES INK IS SUPPLIED ON BUSINESS CARDS ON THE BACK OF CEREAL BOXES BOARD GAMES ANY PLACE YOU USE INK YOU COULD CHANGE THE WAY YOU INTERACT WITH IT
ZachKaplan_2005@712.83:715.77 THIS COULD TOTALLY CHANGE THE WAY THAT YOU INTERFACE WITH PAPER
ZachKaplan_2005@716.01:723.79 YOU SEE THE DARK LINE ON THE SIDE AND THE TOP AS YOU TURN THE PAGES OF THE BOOK THE BOOK CAN ACTUALLY DETECT WHAT PAGE YOU 'RE ON BASED ON THE CURVATURE OF THE PAGES
ZachKaplan_2005@724.75:732.11 IN ADDITION IF YOU WERE TO FOLD IN ONE OF THE CORNERS THEN YOU COULD PROGRAM THE BOOK TO ACTUALLY EMAIL YOU THE TEXT ON THE PAGE FOR YOUR NOTES
ZachKaplan_2005@767.94:771.05 DON 'T LET MILK SPOIL YOUR MORNING
ZachKaplan_2005@807.53:811.58 BEYOND JUST DETECTING SPOILED FOOD IT 'S REALLY WHERE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IT LIES
ZachKaplan_2005@812.19:830.6 HIS COMPANY ACTUALLY DID A SURVEY OF FIREMEN ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO TRY TO LEARN HOW ARE THEY CURRENTLY TESTING THE AIR WHEN THEY RESPOND TO AN EMERGENCY SCENE AND HE KIND OF COMICALLY EXPLAINED THAT TIME AFTER TIME WHAT THE FIREMEN WOULD SAY IS THEY WOULD RUSH TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME THEY WOULD LOOK AROUND IF THERE WERE NO DEAD POLICEMEN IT WAS OK TO GO
ZachKaplan_2005@854.16:857.58 SO A PATIENT CAN COME IN AND ACTUALLY BLOW INTO THEIR DEVICE
ZachKaplan_2005@857.73:861.31 BY DETECTING THE ODOR OF PARTICULAR BACTERIA OR VIRUSES
ZachKaplan_2005@861.46:863.11 OR EVEN LUNG CANCER
ZachKaplan_2005@863.51:870.79 THE DOTS WILL CHANGE AND THEY CAN USE SOFTWARE TO ANALYZE THE RESULTS THIS CAN RADICALLY IMPROVE THE WAY THAT DOCTORS DIAGNOSE PATIENTS
ZachKaplan_2005@871.27:876.08 CURRENTLY THEY 'RE USING A METHOD OF TRIAL AND ERROR BUT THIS COULD TELL YOU PRECISELY WHAT DISEASE YOU HAVE
ZachKaplan_2005@886.05:896 PRIOR TO SEEING THIS WE WOULD HAVE ASSUMED A TEN FOOT POLE COULDN 'T FIT IN YOUR POCKET SOMETHING AS INEXPENSIVE AS INK COULDN 'T SENSE THE WAY PAPER IS BEING BENT EVERY ONE OF THESE THINGS AND WE 'RE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO FIND MORE
ZachKaplan_2005@912.04:923.59 ONE OF THE ITEMS IN IT WAS THE HYDROPHOBIC SAND THE SAND THAT DOESN 'T GET WET HE SAID THAT HE WAS PLAYING WITH IT WITH HIS SON AND YOU KNOW HIS SON WAS MESMERIZED BECAUSE HE WOULD DUNK IT IN THE WATER HE WOULD TAKE IT OUT AND IT WAS BONE DRY
ZachKaplan_2005@936.1:940.69 AFTER HEARING THAT STORY THAT REALLY SUMMED IT UP FOR ME
ZachKaplan_2005@940.7:942.26 THANK YOU VERY MUCH KS THANK YOU
