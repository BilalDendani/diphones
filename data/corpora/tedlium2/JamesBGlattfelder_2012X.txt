JamesBGlattfelder_2012X IMMEDIATELY BECAME APPARENT
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THERE IS ALSO A STRONG BELIEF
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X AND OVERCONFIDENT ECONOMICS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THE FIRST QUOTE IS FROM JEAN CLAUDE TRICHET WHEN HE WAS GOVERNOR OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THE SECOND QUOTE IS FROM THE HEAD OF THE U K FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY ARE THESE PEOPLE IMPLYING THAT WE DON 'T UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMIC SYSTEMS THAT DRIVE OUR MODERN SOCIETIES IT GETS WORSE WE SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE ORIGINS OF THE UNIVERSE
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X WHILE WE STILL DON 'T UNDERSTAND
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THE CONDITIONS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X FOR A STABLE SOCIETY
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X A FUNCTIONING ECONOMY OR PEACE
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X WHAT 'S HAPPENING HERE
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X HOW CAN THIS BE POSSIBLE DO WE REALLY UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THE FABRIC OF REALITY THAN WE DO ABOUT THE FABRIC WHICH EMERGES FROM OUR HUMAN INTERACTIONS UNFORTUNATELY THE ANSWER IS YES
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X BUT THERE 'S AN INTRIGUING SOLUTION WHICH IS COMING FROM
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE SCIENCE OF COMPLEXITY TO EXPLAIN WHAT THIS MEANS AND WHAT THIS THING IS PLEASE LET ME QUICKLY TAKE A COUPLE OF STEPS BACK
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X I ENDED UP IN PHYSICS BY ACCIDENT IT WAS A RANDOM ENCOUNTER WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND SINCE THEN I 'VE OFTEN WONDERED ABOUT THE AMAZING SUCCESS OF PHYSICS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X IN DESCRIBING THE REALITY WE WAKE UP IN EVERY DAY IN A NUTSHELL YOU CAN THINK OF PHYSICS AS FOLLOWS SO YOU TAKE A CHUNK OF REALITY YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND AND YOU TRANSLATE IT INTO MATHEMATICS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X YOU ENCODE IT INTO EQUATIONS THEN PREDICTIONS CAN BE MADE AND TESTED
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X DESPITE THE SUCCESS PHYSICS HAS ITS LIMITS AS DIRK HELBING POINTED OUT IN THE LAST QUOTE WE DON 'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY THAT RELATES TO US THAT SURROUNDS US
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THIS PARADOX IS WHAT GOT ME INTERESTED IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS SO THESE ARE SYSTEMS WHICH ARE MADE UP OF MANY INTERCONNECTED OR INTERACTING PARTS SWARMS OF BIRDS OR FISH
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X INTERESTINGLY COMPLEX SYSTEMS ARE VERY HARD TO MAP INTO MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS SO
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THE USUAL PHYSICS APPROACH DOESN 'T REALLY WORK HERE SO WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT COMPLEX SYSTEMS WELL
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X IT TURNS OUT THAT WHAT LOOKS LIKE COMPLEX BEHAVIOR FROM THE OUTSIDE IS ACTUALLY THE RESULT OF A FEW SIMPLE RULES OF INTERACTION
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THIS MEANS YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT THE EQUATIONS AND JUST START TO UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X BY LOOKING AT THE INTERACTIONS SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY FORGET ABOUT THE EQUATIONS AND YOU JUST START TO LOOK AT THE INTERACTIONS AND IT GETS EVEN BETTER BECAUSE MOST COMPLEX SYSTEMS HAVE THIS AMAZING PROPERTY CALLED EMERGENCE SO THIS MEANS THAT THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE SUDDENLY STARTS TO SHOW A BEHAVIOR WHICH CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X OR PREDICTED BY LOOKING AT THE COMPONENTS OF THE SYSTEM SO THE WHOLE IS LITERALLY MORE THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X AND ALL OF THIS ALSO MEANS THAT YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X OR A BIRD YOU JUST FOCUS ON THE RULES OF INTERACTION
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X AS A RESULT NETWORKS ARE IDEAL REPRESENTATIONS OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THE NODES IN THE NETWORK ARE THE SYSTEM 'S COMPONENTS AND THE LINKS ARE GIVEN BY THE INTERACTIONS SO WHAT EQUATIONS ARE FOR PHYSICS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X COMPLEX NETWORKS ARE FOR THE STUDY OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THIS APPROACH HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED TO MANY COMPLEX SYSTEMS IN PHYSICS BIOLOGY COMPUTER SCIENCE THE SOCIAL SCIENCES BUT WHAT ABOUT ECONOMICS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X WHERE ARE ECONOMIC NETWORKS THIS IS A SURPRISING AND PROMINENT GAP
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X IN THE LITERATURE
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THE STUDY WE PUBLISHED LAST YEAR CALLED
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THE NETWORK OF GLOBAL CORPORATE CONTROL
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X WAS THE FIRST EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS OF ECONOMIC NETWORKS THE STUDY WENT VIRAL ON THE INTERNET AND IT ATTRACTED A LOT OF ATTENTION FROM THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THIS IS QUITE REMARKABLE BECAUSE AGAIN WHY DID NO ONE LOOK AT THIS BEFORE SIMILAR DATA HAS BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE SOME TIME WHAT WE LOOKED AT IN DETAIL WAS OWNERSHIP NETWORKS SO
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X HERE THE NODES ARE COMPANIES PEOPLE GOVERNMENTS FOUNDATIONS ETC
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X AND THE LINKS REPRESENT THE SHAREHOLDING RELATIONS SO SHAREHOLDER A HAS X PERCENT OF THE SHARES IN COMPANY B AND WE ALSO ASSIGN A VALUE TO THE COMPANY GIVEN BY THE OPERATING REVENUE
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X SO OWNERSHIP NETWORKS REVEAL THE PATTERNS OF SHAREHOLDING RELATIONS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X NOW YOU MAY THINK THAT NO ONE 'S LOOKED AT THIS BEFORE BECAUSE OWNERSHIP NETWORKS ARE REALLY REALLY BORING TO STUDY WELL AS OWNERSHIP IS RELATED TO CONTROL AS I SHALL EXPLAIN LATER LOOKING AT OWNERSHIP NETWORKS ACTUALLY CAN GIVE YOU ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS LIKE
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X WHO ARE THE KEY PLAYERS HOW ARE THEY ORGANIZED ARE THEY ISOLATED ARE THEY INTERCONNECTED AND WHAT IS THE OVERALL DISTRIBUTION OF CONTROL
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X A HIGH DEGREE OF INTERCONNECTIVITY CAN BE BAD FOR STABILITY BECAUSE THEN THE STRESS CAN SPREAD THROUGH THE SYSTEM LIKE AN EPIDEMIC
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X SCIENTISTS HAVE SOMETIMES CRITICIZED ECONOMISTS WHO BELIEVE IDEAS AND CONCEPTS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EMPIRICAL DATA
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X BECAUSE A FOUNDATIONAL GUIDELINE IN SCIENCE IS LET THE DATA SPEAK OKAY LET 'S DO THAT SO WE STARTED WITH A DATABASE CONTAINING THIRTEEN MILLION OWNERSHIP RELATIONS FROM TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THIS IS A LOT OF DATA AND BECAUSE WE WANTED TO FIND OUT
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X WHO RULES THE WORLD
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X WE DECIDED TO FOCUS ON TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X OR TNCS FOR SHORT THESE ARE COMPANIES THAT OPERATE IN MORE THAN ONE COUNTRY AND WE FOUND FORTY THREE THOUSAND
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X IN THE NEXT STEP WE BUILT THE NETWORK AROUND THESE COMPANIES SO WE TOOK ALL THE TNCS SHAREHOLDERS AND THE SHAREHOLDERS SHAREHOLDERS ETC ALL THE WAY UPSTREAM AND WE DID THE SAME DOWNSTREAM AND ENDED UP WITH A NETWORK CONTAINING SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND NODES AND ONE MILLION LINKS THIS IS THE TNC NETWORK WHICH WE ANALYZED
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X AND IT TURNS OUT TO BE STRUCTURED AS FOLLOWS SO YOU HAVE A PERIPHERY AND A CENTER WHICH CONTAINS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL THE PLAYERS AND IN THE CENTER THERE 'S THIS TINY BUT DOMINANT CORE
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X WHICH IS MADE UP OF HIGHLY INTERCONNECTED COMPANIES TO GIVE YOU A BETTER PICTURE THINK ABOUT A METROPOLITAN AREA SO YOU HAVE THE SUBURBS AND THE PERIPHERY YOU HAVE A CENTER LIKE
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X A FINANCIAL DISTRICT THEN THE CORE WILL BE SOMETHING LIKE THE TALLEST HIGH RISE BUILDING IN THE CENTER
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X AND WE ALREADY SEE SIGNS OF ORGANIZATION GOING ON HERE
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THIRTY SIX PERCENT OF THE TNCS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X ARE IN THE CORE ONLY BUT THEY MAKE UP NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL OPERATING REVENUE OF ALL TNCS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X OKAY SO NOW WE ANALYZED THE STRUCTURE SO HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO THE CONTROL WELL
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X OWNERSHIP GIVES VOTING RIGHTS TO SHAREHOLDERS THIS IS THE NORMAL NOTION OF CONTROL
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT MODELS WHICH ALLOW YOU TO COMPUTE THE CONTROL YOU GET FROM OWNERSHIP
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF THE SHARES IN A COMPANY YOU GET CONTROL
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X BUT USUALLY IT DEPENDS ON THE RELATIVE DISTRIBUTION OF SHARES AND THE NETWORK REALLY MATTERS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO MR TRONCHETTI PROVERA HAD OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL IN A SMALL COMPANY
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X WHICH HAD OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL IN A BIGGER COMPANY YOU GET THE IDEA THIS ENDED UP GIVING HIM CONTROL IN TELECOM ITALIA WITH A LEVERAGE OF TWENTY SIX
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X NOW WHAT WE ACTUALLY COMPUTED
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X IN OUR STUDY WAS THE CONTROL OVER THE TNCS VALUE THIS ALLOWED US TO ASSIGN A DEGREE OF INFLUENCE TO EACH SHAREHOLDER
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THIS IS VERY MUCH IN THE SENSE OF MAX WEBER 'S IDEA OF POTENTIAL POWER
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X WHICH IS THE PROBABILITY OF IMPOSING ONE 'S OWN WILL DESPITE THE OPPOSITION OF OTHERS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X IF YOU WANT TO COMPUTE THE FLOW
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X IN AN OWNERSHIP NETWORK THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IT 'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD TO UNDERSTAND LET ME EXPLAIN BY GIVING YOU THIS ANALOGY SO THINK ABOUT WATER FLOWING IN PIPES WHERE THE PIPES HAVE DIFFERENT THICKNESS SO SIMILARLY THE CONTROL IS FLOWING IN THE OWNERSHIP NETWORKS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X AND IS ACCUMULATING AT THE NODES
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X SO WHAT DID WE FIND AFTER COMPUTING ALL THIS NETWORK CONTROL WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN TOP SHAREHOLDERS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO COLLECTIVELY CONTROL EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE TNCS VALUE
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X NOW REMEMBER WE STARTED OUT WITH SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND NODES SO
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THESE SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN TOP PLAYERS MAKE UP A BIT MORE THAN ZERO POINT ONE PERCENT
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THEY 'RE MOSTLY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE U S AND THE U K AND IT GETS EVEN MORE EXTREME THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX TOP PLAYERS IN THE CORE
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X AND THEY TOGETHER HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO COLLECTIVELY CONTROL FORTY PERCENT OF THE TNCS VALUE
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X WHAT SHOULD YOU TAKE HOME FROM ALL OF THIS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THE HIGH DEGREE OF INTERCONNECTIVITY OF THE TOP PLAYERS IN THE CORE
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X COULD POSE A SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMIC RISK TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X AND WE COULD EASILY REPRODUCE THE TNC NETWORK WITH A FEW SIMPLE RULES
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X THIS MEANS THAT ITS STRUCTURE IS PROBABLY THE RESULT OF SELF ORGANIZATION IT 'S AN EMERGENT PROPERTY WHICH DEPENDS ON THE RULES OF INTERACTION IN THE SYSTEM SO IT 'S PROBABLY NOT THE RESULT OF A TOP DOWN APPROACH LIKE A GLOBAL CONSPIRACY
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X OUR STUDY IS AN IMPRESSION OF THE MOON 'S SURFACE IT 'S NOT A STREET MAP SO YOU SHOULD TAKE THE EXACT NUMBERS IN OUR STUDY WITH A GRAIN OF SALT YET
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X IT GAVE US A TANTALIZING GLIMPSE OF A BRAVE NEW WORLD OF FINANCE WE HOPE TO HAVE OPENED THE DOOR FOR MORE SUCH RESEARCH IN THIS DIRECTION SO THE REMAINING UNKNOWN TERRAIN WILL BE CHARTED IN THE FUTURE
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X AND THIS IS SLOWLY STARTING WE 'RE SEEING THE EMERGENCE OF LONG TERM AND HIGHLY FUNDED PROGRAMS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X WHICH AIM AT UNDERSTANDING OUR NETWORKED WORLD
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X FROM A COMPLEXITY POINT OF VIEW BUT THIS JOURNEY HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN SO WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT BEFORE WE SEE THE FIRST RESULTS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X NOW THERE IS STILL A BIG PROBLEM IN MY OPINION
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X IDEAS RELATING TO FINANCE ECONOMICS POLITICS SOCIETY
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X I REALLY HOPE THAT THIS COMPLEXITY PERSPECTIVE
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X ALLOWS FOR SOME COMMON GROUND TO BE FOUND IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT IF IT HAS THE POWER TO HELP END THE GRIDLOCK
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X CREATED BY CONFLICTING IDEAS
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X WHICH APPEARS TO BE PARALYZING OUR GLOBALIZED WORLD
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM DOGMA BUT THIS IS JUST MY OWN PERSONAL IDEOLOGY THANK YOU
