SirKenRobinson_2013S I MOVED TO AMERICA TWELVE YEARS AGO WITH MY WIFE TERRY AND OUR TWO KIDS ACTUALLY TRUTHFULLY WE MOVED TO LOS ANGELES
SirKenRobinson_2013S IT 'S A SHORT PLANE RIDE FROM
SirKenRobinson_2013S AMERICANS DON 'T GET IRONY
SirKenRobinson_2013S HAVE YOU COME ACROSS THIS IDEA
SirKenRobinson_2013S IT 'S NOT TRUE I 'VE TRAVELED THE WHOLE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THIS COUNTRY I HAVE FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT AMERICANS DON 'T GET IRONY
SirKenRobinson_2013S IT 'S ONE OF THOSE CULTURAL MYTHS
SirKenRobinson_2013S LIKE THE BRITISH ARE RESERVED
SirKenRobinson_2013S I DON 'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE THINK THIS
SirKenRobinson_2013S BUT I KNEW THAT AMERICANS GET IRONY WHEN I CAME ACROSS THAT LEGISLATION NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND
SirKenRobinson_2013S BECAUSE WHOEVER THOUGHT OF THAT TITLE GETS IRONY
SirKenRobinson_2013S IT 'S LEAVING MILLIONS OF CHILDREN BEHIND NOW I CAN SEE THAT 'S NOT A VERY ATTRACTIVE NAME FOR LEGISLATION
SirKenRobinson_2013S MILLIONS OF CHILDREN LEFT BEHIND I CAN SEE
SirKenRobinson_2013S IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SIXTY PERCENT OF KIDS DROP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
SirKenRobinson_2013S IN THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES IT 'S EIGHTY PERCENT
SirKenRobinson_2013S ONE ESTIMATE IS IT WOULD
SirKenRobinson_2013S CREATE A NET GAIN TO THE U S ECONOMY OVER TEN YEARS
SirKenRobinson_2013S OF NEARLY A TRILLION DOLLARS
SirKenRobinson_2013S FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW THIS IS GOOD MATH ISN 'T
SirKenRobinson_2013S THAT WE SHOULD DO THIS IT ACTUALLY COSTS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT TO MOP UP THE DAMAGE FROM
SirKenRobinson_2013S THE DROPOUT CRISIS BUT THE DROPOUT CRISIS IS JUST THE TIP OF AN ICEBERG WHAT IT DOESN 'T COUNT ARE ALL THE KIDS WHO ARE IN SCHOOL
SirKenRobinson_2013S BUT BEING DISENGAGED FROM IT
SirKenRobinson_2013S WHO DON 'T ENJOY IT WHO DON 'T GET ANY REAL BENEFIT FROM IT AND THE REASON IS NOT THAT WE 'RE NOT SPENDING ENOUGH MONEY AMERICA SPENDS MORE MONEY ON EDUCATION THAN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES
SirKenRobinson_2013S CLASS SIZES ARE SMALLER THAN IN MANY COUNTRIES
SirKenRobinson_2013S AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF INITIATIVES EVERY YEAR TO TRY AND IMPROVE EDUCATION
SirKenRobinson_2013S THE TROUBLE IS
SirKenRobinson_2013S IT 'S ALL GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
SirKenRobinson_2013S THERE ARE THREE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH HUMAN LIFE FLOURISHES
SirKenRobinson_2013S AND THEY ARE CONTRADICTED
SirKenRobinson_2013S BY THE CULTURE OF EDUCATION UNDER WHICH MOST TEACHERS
SirKenRobinson_2013S HAVE TO LABOR AND MOST STUDENTS HAVE TO ENDURE
SirKenRobinson_2013S THE FIRST IS THIS THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE NATURALLY
SirKenRobinson_2013S DIFFERENT AND DIVERSE
SirKenRobinson_2013S I BET YOU THEY ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER
SirKenRobinson_2013S YOU WOULD NEVER CONFUSE THEM WOULD YOU
SirKenRobinson_2013S IS BASED ON NOT DIVERSITY
SirKenRobinson_2013S ONE OF THE EFFECTS OF NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND
SirKenRobinson_2013S HAS BEEN TO NARROW THE FOCUS ONTO THE SO CALLED STEM DISCIPLINES THEY 'RE VERY IMPORTANT
SirKenRobinson_2013S I 'M NOT HERE TO ARGUE AGAINST SCIENCE AND MATH ON THE CONTRARY
SirKenRobinson_2013S A REAL EDUCATION HAS TO GIVE EQUAL WEIGHT TO THE ARTS THE HUMANITIES TO PHYSICAL EDUCATION AN AWFUL LOT OF KIDS
SirKenRobinson_2013S ESTIMATE IN AMERICA CURRENTLY IS THAT SOMETHING LIKE TEN PERCENT OF KIDS GETTING ON THAT WAY ARE BEING DIAGNOSED WITH VARIOUS CONDITIONS UNDER THE BROAD TITLE OF ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER
SirKenRobinson_2013S I JUST DON 'T BELIEVE IT 'S AN EPIDEMIC
SirKenRobinson_2013S LIKE THIS IF YOU SIT KIDS DOWN HOUR AFTER HOUR DOING LOW GRADE CLERICAL WORK
SirKenRobinson_2013S DON 'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY START TO FIDGET
SirKenRobinson_2013S CHILDREN ARE NOT FOR THE MOST PART SUFFERING FROM A PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITION THEY 'RE SUFFERING FROM CHILDHOOD
SirKenRobinson_2013S THEY WILL LEARN WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ASSISTANCE VERY OFTEN CHILDREN ARE NATURAL LEARNERS IT 'S A REAL ACHIEVEMENT TO PUT THAT PARTICULAR ABILITY OUT OR TO STIFLE IT
SirKenRobinson_2013S CURIOSITY IS THE ENGINE OF ACHIEVEMENT NOW THE REASON I SAY THIS IS BECAUSE ONE OF THE EFFECTS OF THE CURRENT CULTURE HERE IF I CAN SAY SO HAS BEEN TO DE PROFESSIONALIZE TEACHERS
SirKenRobinson_2013S THERE IS NO SYSTEM IN THE WORLD
SirKenRobinson_2013S TEACHERS ARE THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE SUCCESS OF SCHOOLS BUT TEACHING IS A CREATIVE PROFESSION
SirKenRobinson_2013S TEACHING PROPERLY CONCEIVED IS NOT A DELIVERY SYSTEM
SirKenRobinson_2013S YOU KNOW YOU 'RE NOT THERE JUST TO PASS ON RECEIVED INFORMATION GREAT TEACHERS DO THAT
SirKenRobinson_2013S BUT WHAT GREAT TEACHERS ALSO DO IS MENTOR STIMULATE PROVOKE ENGAGE YOU SEE IN THE END EDUCATION IS ABOUT LEARNING
SirKenRobinson_2013S BUT A WONDERFUL GUY HE WAS WONDERFUL
SirKenRobinson_2013S YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE ENGAGED IN THE ACTIVITY OF SOMETHING BUT NOT REALLY BE ACHIEVING IT LIKE
SirKenRobinson_2013S BUT IF NOBODY 'S LEARNING ANYTHING
SirKenRobinson_2013S SHE MAY BE ENGAGED IN THE TASK OF TEACHING BUT NOT ACTUALLY
SirKenRobinson_2013S LEARNING THAT 'S IT AND PART OF THE PROBLEM IS I THINK THAT THE DOMINANT CULTURE OF EDUCATION HAS COME TO FOCUS ON NOT TEACHING AND LEARNING BUT TESTING
SirKenRobinson_2013S NOW TESTING IS IMPORTANT STANDARDIZED TESTS HAVE A PLACE
SirKenRobinson_2013S BUT THEY SHOULD NOT BE THE DOMINANT CULTURE OF EDUCATION THEY SHOULD BE DIAGNOSTIC
SirKenRobinson_2013S IF I GO FOR A MEDICAL EXAMINATION
SirKenRobinson_2013S I WANT SOME STANDARDIZED TESTS I DO
SirKenRobinson_2013S YOU KNOW I WANT TO KNOW WHAT MY CHOLESTEROL LEVEL IS COMPARED TO EVERYBODY ELSE 'S
SirKenRobinson_2013S ON A STANDARD SCALE I DON 'T WANT TO BE TOLD ON SOME SCALE MY DOCTOR INVENTED IN THE
SirKenRobinson_2013S YOUR CHOLESTEROL IS WHAT I CALL LEVEL ORANGE
SirKenRobinson_2013S BUT ALL THAT SHOULD SUPPORT
SirKenRobinson_2013S WHICH OF COURSE IT OFTEN DOES SO IN PLACE OF CURIOSITY WHAT WE HAVE IS A CULTURE OF COMPLIANCE
SirKenRobinson_2013S IT 'S WHY WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT RESUMES
SirKenRobinson_2013S WE CREATE OUR LIVES AND WE CAN RECREATE THEM AS WE GO THROUGH THEM IT 'S THE COMMON CURRENCY OF BEING A HUMAN BEING IT 'S WHY HUMAN CULTURE IS SO INTERESTING AND DIVERSE AND DYNAMIC I MEAN OTHER ANIMALS MAY WELL HAVE IMAGINATIONS AND CREATIVITY BUT IT 'S NOT SO MUCH IN EVIDENCE IS IT AS OURS I MEAN YOU MAY HAVE A DOG
SirKenRobinson_2013S SIT STARING OUT THE WINDOW WITH A BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS
SirKenRobinson_2013S NOW IT DOESN 'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY IT REALLY DOESN 'T
SirKenRobinson_2013S THE THING ABOUT WORK IN FINLAND IS THIS
SirKenRobinson_2013S THEY DON 'T OBSESS ABOUT THOSE DISCIPLINES THEY HAVE A VERY BROAD APPROACH TO EDUCATION WHICH INCLUDES HUMANITIES PHYSICAL EDUCATION THE ARTS
SirKenRobinson_2013S BUT YOU CAN COMPARE IT TO A STATE IN AMERICA
SirKenRobinson_2013S MANY STATES IN AMERICA HAVE FEWER PEOPLE IN THEM THAN THAT
SirKenRobinson_2013S BUT WHAT ALL THE HIGH PERFORMING SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD DO
SirKenRobinson_2013S IS CURRENTLY WHAT IS NOT EVIDENT
SirKenRobinson_2013S SADLY ACROSS THE SYSTEMS IN AMERICA
SirKenRobinson_2013S THEY INDIVIDUALIZE TEACHING AND LEARNING THEY RECOGNIZE THAT IT 'S STUDENTS WHO ARE LEARNING
SirKenRobinson_2013S AND THE SYSTEM HAS TO ENGAGE THEM THEIR CURIOSITY THEIR INDIVIDUALITY AND THEIR CREATIVITY THAT 'S HOW YOU GET THEM TO LEARN
SirKenRobinson_2013S THE SECOND IS THAT THEY ATTRIBUTE A VERY HIGH STATUS TO THE TEACHING
SirKenRobinson_2013S TO THE SCHOOL LEVEL FOR GETTING THE JOB DONE
SirKenRobinson_2013S YOU SEE THERE 'S A BIG DIFFERENCE HERE
SirKenRobinson_2013S BETWEEN GOING INTO A MODE OF COMMAND AND CONTROL IN EDUCATION THAT 'S WHAT HAPPENS IN SOME SYSTEMS YOU KNOW CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS DECIDE OR STATE GOVERNMENTS DECIDE THEY KNOW BEST AND THEY 'RE GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO THE TROUBLE IS THAT
SirKenRobinson_2013S EDUCATION DOESN 'T GO ON IN THE COMMITTEE ROOMS OF OUR LEGISLATIVE BUILDINGS IT HAPPENS IN CLASSROOMS AND SCHOOLS AND THE PEOPLE WHO DO IT ARE THE TEACHERS AND THE STUDENTS AND IF YOU REMOVE THEIR DISCRETION IT STOPS WORKING
SirKenRobinson_2013S BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT 'S HAPPENING IN SPITE OF THE DOMINANT CULTURE OF EDUCATION NOT BECAUSE OF IT IT 'S LIKE PEOPLE ARE SAILING INTO A HEADWIND ALL THE TIME
SirKenRobinson_2013S OF EDUCATION IT 'S LIKE
SirKenRobinson_2013S EDUCATION IS AN INDUSTRIAL PROCESS
SirKenRobinson_2013S THAT CAN BE IMPROVED JUST BY HAVING BETTER DATA AND SOMEWHERE IN I THINK THE BACK OF THE MIND OF SOME POLICY MAKERS IS THIS IDEA THAT IF WE FINE TUNE IT WELL ENOUGH IF WE JUST GET IT RIGHT IT WILL ALL HUM ALONG PERFECTLY INTO THE FUTURE
SirKenRobinson_2013S IT WON 'T AND IT NEVER DID
SirKenRobinson_2013S THE POINT IS THAT EDUCATION
SirKenRobinson_2013S IS NOT A MECHANICAL SYSTEM IT 'S A HUMAN SYSTEM
SirKenRobinson_2013S I WAS AT A MEETING RECENTLY IN LOS ANGELES OF THEY 'RE CALLED ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAMS THESE ARE PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO GET KIDS BACK INTO EDUCATION
SirKenRobinson_2013S THEY HAVE CERTAIN COMMON FEATURES
SirKenRobinson_2013S THEY 'RE VERY PERSONALIZED
SirKenRobinson_2013S THEY HAVE STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE TEACHERS
SirKenRobinson_2013S CLOSE LINKS WITH THE COMMUNITY AND A BROAD AND DIVERSE CURRICULUM AND OFTEN PROGRAMS WHICH INVOLVE STUDENTS OUTSIDE SCHOOL AS WELL AS INSIDE SCHOOL
SirKenRobinson_2013S SO I THINK WE HAVE TO EMBRACE A DIFFERENT METAPHOR WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT 'S A HUMAN SYSTEM AND THERE ARE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH PEOPLE THRIVE
SirKenRobinson_2013S AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY DON 'T WE ARE AFTER ALL ORGANIC CREATURES
SirKenRobinson_2013S NOT FAR FROM WHERE I LIVE IS A PLACE CALLED DEATH VALLEY
SirKenRobinson_2013S DRIEST PLACE IN AMERICA AND NOTHING GROWS THERE
SirKenRobinson_2013S NOTHING GROWS THERE BECAUSE IT DOESN 'T RAIN
SirKenRobinson_2013S WAS CARPETED IN FLOWERS
SirKenRobinson_2013S WAITING FOR THE RIGHT CONDITIONS TO COME ABOUT
SirKenRobinson_2013S AND WITH ORGANIC SYSTEMS IF THE CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT
SirKenRobinson_2013S AND SCHOOLS THAT WERE ONCE BEREFT SPRING TO LIFE
SirKenRobinson_2013S GREAT LEADERS KNOW THAT
SirKenRobinson_2013S THE REAL ROLE OF LEADERSHIP IN EDUCATION AND I THINK IT 'S TRUE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL THE STATE LEVEL AT THE SCHOOL LEVEL
SirKenRobinson_2013S THE REAL ROLE OF LEADERSHIP IS CLIMATE CONTROL
SirKenRobinson_2013S CREATING A CLIMATE OF POSSIBILITY
SirKenRobinson_2013S AND IF YOU DO THAT PEOPLE WILL RISE TO IT AND ACHIEVE THINGS THAT YOU COMPLETELY DID NOT ANTICIPATE AND COULDN 'T HAVE EXPECTED
SirKenRobinson_2013S THERE 'S A WONDERFUL QUOTE FROM BENJAMIN FRANKLIN THERE ARE THREE SORTS OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
SirKenRobinson_2013S THOSE WHO ARE IMMOVABLE
SirKenRobinson_2013S PEOPLE WHO DON 'T GET THEY DON 'T WANT TO GET IT THEY 'RE GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOVABLE
SirKenRobinson_2013S AND IF THE MOVEMENT IS STRONG ENOUGH
SirKenRobinson_2013S THAT 'S IN THE BEST SENSE OF THE WORD A REVOLUTION
