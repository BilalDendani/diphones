MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 TO DO THIS TEDTALK I WAS REALLY CHUCKLED BECAUSE YOU SEE MY FATHER 'S NAME WAS TED AND MUCH OF MY LIFE ESPECIALLY MY MUSICAL LIFE IS REALLY A TALK THAT I 'M STILL HAVING WITH HIM OR THE PART OF ME THAT HE CONTINUES TO BE
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 HE WAS A SELF TAUGHT ILLUSTRATOR AND MUSICIAN HE DIDN 'T READ A NOTE
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 AND HE WAS PROFOUNDLY HEARING IMPAIRED YET HE WAS MY GREATEST TEACHER
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 BECAUSE EVEN THROUGH THE SQUEAKS OF HIS HEARING AIDS HIS UNDERSTANDING OF MUSIC WAS PROFOUND AND FOR HIM IT WASN 'T SO MUCH
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 THE WAY THE MUSIC GOES AS ABOUT WHAT IT WITNESSES AND WHERE IT CAN TAKE YOU AND HE DID A PAINTING OF THIS EXPERIENCE WHICH HE CALLED IN THE REALM OF MUSIC
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 THEY DIDN 'T KNOW ALL THAT MUCH ABOUT IT BUT THEY GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCOVER IT TOGETHER WITH THEM AND I THINK INSPIRED BY THAT MEMORY IT 'S BEEN MY DESIRE TO TRY AND BRING IT TO AS MANY OTHER PEOPLE AS I CAN SORT OF PASS IT ON THROUGH WHATEVER MEANS
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 AND HOW PEOPLE GET THIS MUSIC HOW IT COMES INTO THEIR LIVES REALLY FASCINATES ME ONE DAY IN NEW YORK I WAS ON THE STREET AND I SAW SOME KIDS PLAYING BASEBALL BETWEEN STOOPS AND CARS AND FIRE HYDRANTS AND A TOUGH SLOUCHY KID GOT UP TO BAT
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 AND HE RAN AROUND THE BASES
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 AND I THOUGHT GO FIGURE HOW DID THIS PIECE OF EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AUSTRIAN ARISTOCRATIC ENTERTAINMENT
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 TURN INTO THE VICTORY CROW OF THIS NEW YORK
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 CLASSICAL MUSIC IS AN UNBROKEN LIVING TRADITION THAT GOES BACK OVER ONE THOUSAND YEARS AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE YEARS HAS HAD SOMETHING UNIQUE AND POWERFUL TO SAY TO US ABOUT WHAT IT 'S LIKE TO BE ALIVE
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 BUT WHAT CLASSICAL MUSIC DOES
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 IS TO DISTILL ALL OF THESE MUSICS DOWN TO CONDENSE THEM TO THEIR ABSOLUTE ESSENCE AND FROM THAT ESSENCE CREATE
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 A NEW LANGUAGE A LANGUAGE THAT SPEAKS VERY LOVINGLY
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 IT 'S A LANGUAGE THAT 'S STILL EVOLVING
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 NOW OVER THE CENTURIES IT GREW INTO THE BIG PIECES WE ALWAYS THINK OF LIKE
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 TO BRING YOU BACK TO A FRAGILE AND PERSONAL MOMENT LIKE THIS ONE FROM
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 THE BEETHOVEN VIOLIN CONCERTO
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 IT 'S SO SIMPLE
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY PER SECOND
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 BUT THE WAY WE REACT TO DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF THESE PHENOMENA IS COMPLEX AND EMOTIONAL AND NOT TOTALLY UNDERSTOOD
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 AND
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 AND IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 IT WAS MORE LIKE THIS
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 HAPPY WITH THIS LAST CHORD EVEN THOUGH A WHILE BACK IT WOULD HAVE PUZZLED OR ANNOYED YOU OR SENT SOME OF YOU RUNNING FROM THE ROOM AND THE REASON YOU LIKE IT IS BECAUSE YOU 'VE INHERITED WHETHER YOU KNEW IT OR NOT CENTURIES WORTH
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 OF THE MUSIC 'S POWERFUL SILENT PARTNER THE WAY IT 'S BEEN PASSED ON NOTATION NOW THE IMPULSE TO NOTATE OR MORE EXACTLY I SHOULD SAY ENCODE MUSIC
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 IN TWO HUNDRED B C A MAN NAMED SEKULOS WROTE THIS SONG FOR HIS DEPARTED WIFE AND INSCRIBED IT ON HER GRAVESTONE IN THE NOTATIONAL SYSTEM OF THE GREEKS
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 IN THESE EXCERPTS FROM THE CHRISTMAS MASS PUER NATUS EST NOBIS FOR US IS BORN
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 WELL NOTATION NOT ONLY PASSED THE MUSIC ON NOTATING AND ENCODING THE MUSIC CHANGED ITS PRIORITIES ENTIRELY BECAUSE IT ENABLED THE MUSICIANS TO IMAGINE MUSIC ON A MUCH VASTER SCALE NOW
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 INSPIRED MOVES OF IMPROVISATION COULD BE RECORDED SAVED CONSIDERED
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 PRIORITIZED MADE INTO INTRICATE DESIGNS AND FROM THIS MOMENT CLASSICAL MUSIC BECAME WHAT IT MOST ESSENTIALLY IS A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE TWO POWERFUL SIDES OF OUR NATURE INSTINCT AND INTELLIGENCE
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 AND THERE BEGAN TO BE A REAL DIFFERENCE AT THIS POINT BETWEEN THE ART OF IMPROVISATION AND THE ART OF COMPOSITION
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 ALL POSSIBLE MOVES TESTING THEM OUT PRIORITIZING THEM OUT UNTIL HE SEES HOW THEY CAN FORM A POWERFUL AND COHERENT DESIGN OF ULTIMATE AND ENDURING
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 BUT EVERY MUSICIAN STRIKES A DIFFERENT BALANCE BETWEEN FAITH AND REASON INSTINCT AND INTELLIGENCE AND EVERY MUSICAL ERA HAD DIFFERENT PRIORITIES OF THESE THINGS DIFFERENT THINGS TO PASS ON DIFFERENT WHATS
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 THE BIG WHAT WAS TO PRAISE GOD AND BY THE ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED S MUSIC WAS BEING WRITTEN THAT TRIED TO MIRROR GOD 'S MIND AS COULD BE SEEN IN THE DESIGN OF THE NIGHT SKY
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 THIS
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 THIS OF COURSE WAS THE BIRTH OF OPERA AND ITS DEVELOPMENT PUT MUSIC ON A RADICAL NEW COURSE THE WHAT NOW WAS NOT TO MIRROR THE MIND OF GOD BUT TO FOLLOW THE EMOTION TURBULENCE OF MAN
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 HAVE WITH US THE TRIADS EITHER THE
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 MAJOR ONE
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE VIBRATIONS PER SECOND
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 OR E FLAT
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 THIRTY SEVEN FREAKIN VIBRATIONS
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 SO YOU CAN SEE IN A SYSTEM LIKE THIS THERE WAS ENORMOUS SUBTLE POTENTIAL OF REPRESENTING HUMAN EMOTIONS AND IN FACT AS MAN BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND MORE HIS COMPLEX AND AMBIVALENT NATURE HARMONY GREW MORE COMPLEX TO REFLECT IT
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 EMOTIONS BEYOND THE ABILITY OF WORDS
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 PRINTING PUT MUSIC THE SCORES THE CODEBOOKS OF MUSIC INTO THE HANDS OF PERFORMERS EVERYWHERE
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 THIS IS WHEN THOSE BIG FORMS AROSE THE SYMPHONIES THE SONATAS THE CONCERTOS AND IN THESE BIG ARCHITECTURES OF TIME
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 COMPOSERS LIKE BEETHOVEN COULD SHARE THE INSIGHTS OF A LIFETIME
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 A PIECE LIKE BEETHOVEN 'S FIFTH
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 BASICALLY WITNESSING HOW IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GO FROM SORROW AND ANGER
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 OVER THE COURSE OF A HALF AN HOUR STEP BY EXACTING STEP
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 OF HIS ROUTE TO THE MOMENT WHEN HE COULD MAKE IT ACROSS TO JOY
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 AND IT TURNED OUT THE SYMPHONY COULD BE USED FOR MORE COMPLEX ISSUES LIKE
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 GRIPPING ONES OF CULTURE SUCH AS NATIONALISM OR
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 QUEST FOR FREEDOM OR THE FRONTIERS OF
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 ONE THING UNTIL RECENTLY WAS ALWAYS THE SAME AND THAT WAS
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 WHEN THE MUSICIANS STOPPED PLAYING THE MUSIC STOPPED
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 WHAT 'S LEFT WHAT STICKS WITH PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE AT THE END OF A PERFORMANCE IS IT A MELODY OR A RHYTHM OR A MOOD OR AN ATTITUDE AND HOW MIGHT THAT CHANGE THEIR LIVES TO ME THIS IS THE INTIMATE PERSONAL SIDE OF MUSIC IT 'S THE PASSING ON PART IT 'S THE WHY PART OF IT
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 TO ME THAT 'S THE MOST ESSENTIAL OF ALL
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 MOSTLY IT 'S BEEN A PERSON TO PERSON THING A TEACHER STUDENT PERFORMER AUDIENCE THING
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 AND THEN AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY CAME THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT FIRST MECHANICALLY THEN THROUGH ANALOGS THEN DIGITALLY CREATED A NEW AND MIRACULOUS WAY OF
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 PASSING THINGS ON
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 ALBEIT AN IMPERSONAL ONE
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 PEOPLE COULD NOW HEAR MUSIC ALL THE TIME EVEN THOUGH IT WASN 'T NECESSARY FOR THEM TO PLAY AN INSTRUMENT READ MUSIC OR EVEN GO TO CONCERTS
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 AND TECHNOLOGY PUSHED COMPOSERS TO TREMENDOUS EXTREMES USING COMPUTERS AND SYNTHESIZERS TO CREATE WORKS OF INTELLECTUALLY IMPENETRABLE COMPLEXITY BEYOND THE MEANS OF PERFORMERS AND AUDIENCES AT THE SAME TIME
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 TECHNOLOGY BY TAKING OVER THE ROLE THAT NOTATION HAD ALWAYS PLAYED SHIFTED THE BALANCE WITHIN MUSIC BETWEEN INSTINCT AND INTELLIGENCE WAY OVER TO THE INSTINCTIVE SIDE THE CULTURE IN WHICH WE LIVE NOW
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 IS AWASH WITH MUSIC OF IMPROVISATION THAT 'S BEEN SLICED DICED LAYERED AND GOD KNOWS DISTRIBUTED AND SOLD
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 WHAT 'S THE LONG TERM EFFECT OF THIS ON US OR ON MUSIC NOBODY KNOWS
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 THE QUESTION REMAINS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS WHAT STICKS WITH PEOPLE NOW THAT WE HAVE UNLIMITED ACCESS TO MUSIC WHAT DOES STICK WITH US WELL LET ME SHOW YOU A STORY OF WHAT I MEAN BY REALLY STICKING WITH US I WAS VISITING A COUSIN OF MINE IN AN OLD AGE HOME
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 AND I SPIED A VERY SHAKY OLD MAN MAKING HIS WAY ACROSS THE ROOM ON A WALKER HE CAME OVER TO A PIANO THAT WAS THERE AND HE BALANCED HIMSELF AND BEGAN PLAYING SOMETHING LIKE THIS
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 SUDDENLY GOT IT AND I SAID FRIEND
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 BY ANY CHANCE ARE YOU TRYING TO PLAY THIS
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 WELL THAT 'S WHY I TAKE EVERY PERFORMANCE SO SERIOUSLY WHY IT MATTERS TO ME SO MUCH I NEVER KNOW WHO MIGHT BE THERE WHO MIGHT BE ABSORBING IT AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO IT IN THEIR LIFE
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 BUT NOW I 'M EXCITED THAT THERE 'S MORE CHANCE THAN EVER BEFORE POSSIBLE OF SHARING THIS MUSIC
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 THAT 'S WHAT DRIVES MY INTEREST IN PROJECTS LIKE THE TV SERIES KEEPING SCORE WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY THAT LOOKS AT THE BACKSTORIES OF MUSIC AND WORKING
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 WITH THE YOUNG MUSICIANS AT THE NEW WORLD SYMPHONY ON PROJECTS THAT EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF THE NEW PERFORMING ARTS CENTERS FOR BOTH ENTERTAINMENT AND EDUCATION AND OF COURSE THE NEW WORLD
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 TO BE EXPLORERS TOGETHER
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 SURE THE BIG EVENTS ATTRACT A LOT OF ATTENTION BUT WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS WHAT GOES ON EVERY SINGLE DAY
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 WE NEED YOUR PERSPECTIVES YOUR CURIOSITY YOUR VOICES AND IT EXCITES ME NOW TO MEET PEOPLE WHO ARE HIKERS CHEFS CODE WRITERS TAXI DRIVERS PEOPLE I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED WHO LOVED THE MUSIC AND WHO ARE PASSING IT ON
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 YOU DON 'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT KNOWING ANYTHING IF YOU 'RE CURIOUS IF YOU HAVE A CAPACITY FOR WONDER IF YOU 'RE ALIVE YOU KNOW ALL THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 YOU CAN START ANYWHERE RAMBLE A BIT FOLLOW TRACES GET LOST BE SURPRISED AMUSED INSPIRED ALL THAT WHAT ALL THAT HOW IS OUT THERE WAITING FOR YOU TO DISCOVER ITS WHY
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 TO DIVE IN AND PASS IT ON
