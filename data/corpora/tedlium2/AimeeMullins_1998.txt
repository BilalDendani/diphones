AimeeMullins_1998 I WAS BORN WITHOUT FIBULAS IN BOTH LEGS I WAS AMPUTATED AT AGE ONE AND I'VE BEEN RUNNING LIKE HELL
AimeeMullins_1998 STUDENTS OUT OF THE NATION EVERY YEAR TO GET INVOLVED IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND SO I WON A FULL RIDE TO GEORGETOWN
AimeeMullins_1998 AND I'VE BEEN THERE FOR FOUR YEARS LOVE IT
AimeeMullins_1998 AIMEE GOT THERE SHE DECIDED THAT SHE 'S KIND OF CURIOUS ABOUT TRACK AND FIELD SO SHE DECIDED TO CALL SOMEONE AND START ASKING ABOUT IT SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL
