NathanielKahn_2002 SAY ABOUT FILM MAKING IS ABOUT THIS FILM IN THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE WONDERFUL TALKS WE'VE HEARD HERE MICHAEL MOSCHEN AND SOME OF THE TALKS ABOUT MUSIC
NathanielKahn_2002 THIS IDEA THAT THERE IS A NARRATIVE LINE AND THAT MUSIC EXISTS IN TIME A FILM ALSO EXISTS IN TIME IT'S AN EXPERIENCE THAT YOU SHOULD GO THROUGH EMOTIONALLY
NathanielKahn_2002 AND IN MAKING THIS FILM I FELT THAT SO MANY OF THE DOCUMENTARIES I'VE SEEN WERE ALL ABOUT LEARNING SOMETHING OR KNOWLEDGE OR DRIVEN BY TALKING HEADS AND DRIVEN BY IDEAS AND I WANTED THIS FILM TO BE DRIVEN BY EMOTIONS AND REALLY TO FOLLOW MY JOURNEY
NathanielKahn_2002 SO INSTEAD OF DOING THE TALKING HEAD THING INSTEAD IT'S COMPOSED OF SCENES AND WE MEET PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY WE ONLY MEET THEM ONCE THEY DON'T COME BACK SEVERAL TIMES
NathanielKahn_2002 SO IT REALLY CHRONICLES A JOURNEY IT'S SOMETHING LIKE LIFE THAT ONCE YOU GET IN IT YOU CAN'T GET OUT
NathanielKahn_2002 TWO CLIPS I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE FIRST ONE IS A KIND OF HODGEPODGE ITS JUST THREE LITTLE MOMENTS FOUR LITTLE MOMENTS WITH THREE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE TONIGHT
NathanielKahn_2002 IT'S NOT THE WAY THEY OCCUR IN THE FILM BECAUSE THEY ARE PART OF MUCH LARGER SCENES THEY PLAY OFF EACH OTHER IN A WONDERFUL WAY AND THAT ENDS WITH A LITTLE CLIP OF MY FATHER OF
NathanielKahn_2002 IT WAS BUILT ENTIRELY BY HAND I THINK THEY GOT A CRANE THE LAST YEAR IT WAS BUILT ENTIRELY BY HAND OFF BAMBOO SCAFFOLDING
NathanielKahn_2002 WHICH IS SOMETHING THEY SEEM TO BE VERY PROUD OF OVER THERE IT TOOK AS LONG AS THE TAJ MAHAL UNFORTUNATELY IT TOOK SO LONG THAT LOU NEVER SAW IT FINISHED HE DIED
NathanielKahn_2002 THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU SEE THAT BUILDING THAT SOMETIMES THE THINGS WE STRIVE FOR SO HARD IN LIFE WE NEVER GET TO SEE FINISHED AND THAT REALLY STRUCK ME ABOUT MY FATHER IN THE SENSE THAT HE HAD SUCH BELIEF
NathanielKahn_2002 THAT SOMEHOW DOING THESE THINGS GIVING IN THE WAY THAT HE GAVE THAT SOMETHING GOOD WOULD COME OUT OF IT EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR THERE WAS A WAR WITH PAKISTAN AT ONE POINT AND THE CONSTRUCTION STOPPED TOTALLY AND HE KEPT WORKING
NathanielKahn_2002 BECAUSE HE FELT WELL WHEN THE WAR IS DONE THEY'LL NEED THIS BUILDING SO THOSE ARE THE TWO CLIPS I'M GOING TO SHOW ROLL THAT TAPE
NathanielKahn_2002 REMEMBER HEARING HIM TALK AT PENN AND I CAME HOME AND I SAID TO MY FATHER AND MOTHER I JUST MET THIS MAN DOESN'T HAVE MUCH WORK AND HE 'S SORT OF UGLY FUNNY VOICE
NathanielKahn_2002 AND HE 'S A TEACHER AT SCHOOL I KNOW YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM BUT JUST MARK THIS DAY THAT SOMEDAY YOU WILL HEAR OF HIM BECAUSE HE 'S REALLY AN AMAZING MAN
NathanielKahn_2002 FLING WITH INGRID BERGMAN
NathanielKahn_2002 HE
NathanielKahn_2002 HE WAS IN ROME MOSHE SAFDIE HE WAS A REAL NOMAD AND YOU KNOW
NathanielKahn_2002 A PLANE OR I'M GOING TO DIE IN AN AIRPORT OR DIE JOGGING WITHOUT AN IDENTIFICATION ON ME I DON'T KNOW WHY I SORT OF CARRY THAT FROM THAT MEMORY OF THE WAY
NathanielKahn_2002 HOW ACCIDENTAL OUR EXISTENCES ARE REALLY AND HOW FULL OF
NathanielKahn_2002 THE TIME HERE AND ENJOY THE WALKING CITY 'S BEAUTY AND THE
NathanielKahn_2002 THIS IS THE NICEST
NathanielKahn_2002 WELL ACTUALLY I'M HERE BECAUSE I'M THE
NathanielKahn_2002 NO HE 'S BEEN DEAD FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS
NathanielKahn_2002 WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE BUILDING FOR A COUNTRY LIKE OURS IN FIFTY YEARS BACK IT WAS NOTHING ONLY PADDY FIELDS AND SINCE WE INVITED HIM HERE HE FELT THAT HE HAS GOT
NathanielKahn_2002 HE WANTED TO BE A MOSES HERE HE GAVE US DEMOCRACY HE IS NOT A POLITICAL MAN BUT IN THIS GUISE HE HAS GIVEN US THE INSTITUTION FOR
NathanielKahn_2002 HE DIDN'T CARE FOR HOW MUCH MONEY THIS COUNTRY HAS OR WHETHER HE WOULD BE ABLE TO EVER FINISH THIS BUILDING BUT SOMEHOW HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO IT BUILD IT HERE AND THIS IS THE LARGEST PROJECT HE HAS GOT IN HERE THE POOREST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD NK IT COST HIM HIS LIFE
NathanielKahn_2002 YEAH HE PAID HE PAID HIS LIFE FOR THIS AND THAT IS WHY HE IS GREAT AND WE'LL REMEMBER HIM
NathanielKahn_2002 BUT HE WAS ALSO HUMAN NOW HIS FAILURE TO SATISFY THE FAMILY LIFE IS AN INEVITABLE ASSOCIATION OF
NathanielKahn_2002 HE CARED IN A VERY DIFFERENT MANNER BUT IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME
NathanielKahn_2002 HE WAS JUST LIKE A CHILD HE WAS NOT AT ALL MATURED HE COULD NOT SAY NO TO ANYTHING AND THAT IS WHY THAT HE CAN NOT SAY NO TO THINGS WE GOT THIS BUILDING TODAY
NathanielKahn_2002 SEE ONLY THAT
NathanielKahn_2002 WAY TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HIM BUT I THINK HE HAS GIVEN US THIS BUILDING
NathanielKahn_2002 WE FEEL ALL THE TIME FOR HIM THAT'S WHY HE
NathanielKahn_2002 NOT SEE THE VERY
NathanielKahn_2002 THAT IS INEVITABLE FOR
