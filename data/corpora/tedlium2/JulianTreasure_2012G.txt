JulianTreasure_2012G OUR SOCIAL BEHAVIOR
JulianTreasure_2012G AND OUR PRODUCTIVITY AS WELL
JulianTreasure_2012G HOW DOES THIS WORK WELL TWO WAYS FIRST OF ALL AMBIENCE I HAVE A WHOLE TEDTALK ABOUT THIS SOUND AFFECTS US PHYSIOLOGICALLY PSYCHOLOGICALLY COGNITIVELY AND BEHAVIORALLY ALL THE TIME THE SOUND AROUND US IS AFFECTING US EVEN THOUGH WE 'RE NOT CONSCIOUS OF IT
JulianTreasure_2012G THERE 'S A SECOND WAY THOUGH AS WELL THAT 'S INTERFERENCE
JulianTreasure_2012G COMMUNICATION REQUIRES SENDING AND RECEIVING
JulianTreasure_2012G WHEN I SEE A CLASSROOM THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW THIS SOUNDS I AM FORCED TO ASK MYSELF A QUESTION
JulianTreasure_2012G UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS DESIGNED LIKE A CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS WITH A VAST CENTRAL ATRIUM AND CLASSROOMS LEADING OFF IT WITH NO BACK WALLS AT ALL
JulianTreasure_2012G THE CHILDREN COULDN 'T HEAR THEIR TEACHERS THEY HAD TO GO BACK IN AND SPEND SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS PUTTING THE WALLS IN LET 'S STOP THIS MADNESS OF OPEN PLAN CLASSROOMS RIGHT NOW
JulianTreasure_2012G PLEASE IT 'S NOT JUST THESE MODERN BUILDINGS WHICH SUFFER OLD FASHIONED CLASSROOMS SUFFER TOO A STUDY IN FLORIDA JUST A FEW YEARS AGO FOUND THAT IF YOU 'RE SITTING WHERE THIS PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN IN THE CLASSROOM ROW FOUR SPEECH INTELLIGIBILITY IS JUST FIFTY PERCENT
JulianTreasure_2012G CHILDREN ARE LOSING ONE WORD IN TWO NOW THAT DOESN 'T MEAN THEY ONLY GET HALF THEIR EDUCATION BUT IT DOES MEAN THEY HAVE TO WORK VERY HARD TO JOIN THE DOTS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT 'S GOING ON THIS IS AFFECTED MASSIVELY BY REVERBERATION TIME HOW REVERBERANT A ROOM IS IN A CLASSROOM WITH A REVERBERATION TIME OF ONE POINT TWO SECONDS WHICH IS PRETTY COMMON
JulianTreasure_2012G THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE
JulianTreasure_2012G NOT SO GOOD IS IT IF YOU TAKE THAT ONE POINT TWO SECONDS DOWN TO ZERO POINT FOUR SECONDS BY INSTALLING ACOUSTIC TREATMENTS SOUND ABSORBING MATERIALS AND SO FORTH THIS IS WHAT YOU GET
JulianTreasure_2012G IF EDUCATION CAN BE LIKENED TO WATERING A GARDEN WHICH IS A FAIR METAPHOR SADLY MUCH OF THE WATER IS EVAPORATING BEFORE IT REACHES THE FLOWERS ESPECIALLY FOR SOME GROUPS
JulianTreasure_2012G FOR EXAMPLE THOSE WITH HEARING IMPAIRMENT NOW THAT 'S NOT JUST DEAF CHILDREN THAT COULD BE ANY CHILD WHO 'S GOT A COLD GLUE EAR AN EAR INFECTION EVEN HAY FEVER ON A GIVEN DAY ONE IN EIGHT CHILDREN FALL INTO THAT GROUP ON ANY GIVEN DAY
JulianTreasure_2012G THEN YOU HAVE CHILDREN FOR WHOM ENGLISH IS A SECOND LANGUAGE OR WHATEVER THEY 'RE BEING TAUGHT IN IS A SECOND LANGUAGE IN THE U K THAT 'S MORE THAN TEN PERCENT OF THE SCHOOL POPULATION
JulianTreasure_2012G AND FINALLY AFTER SUSAN CAIN 'S WONDERFUL TEDTALK IN FEBRUARY WE KNOW THAT INTROVERTS FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO RELATE WHEN THEY 'RE IN A NOISY ENVIRONMENT DOING GROUP WORK
JulianTreasure_2012G IN FACT SIXTY FIVE DECIBELS IS THE VERY LEVEL AT WHICH THIS BIG SURVEY OF ALL THE EVIDENCE ON NOISE AND HEALTH FOUND THAT THAT IS THE THRESHOLD FOR THE DANGER OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
JulianTreasure_2012G WHAT DOES IT COST TO TREAT A CLASSROOM DOWN TO THAT ZERO POINT FOUR SECOND REVERBERATION TIME
JulianTreasure_2012G TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND POUNDS AND THE ESSEX STUDY WHICH HAS JUST BEEN DONE IN THE U K WHICH INCIDENTALLY SHOWED THAT WHEN YOU DO THIS YOU DO NOT JUST MAKE A ROOM THAT 'S SUITABLE FOR HEARING IMPAIRED CHILDREN YOU MAKE A ROOM WHERE BEHAVIOR IMPROVES AND RESULTS IMPROVE SIGNIFICANTLY THIS FOUND THAT
JulianTreasure_2012G SENDING A CHILD OUT OF AREA TO A SCHOOL THAT DOES HAVE SUCH A ROOM IF YOU DON 'T HAVE ONE COSTS
JulianTreasure_2012G NINETY THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR
JulianTreasure_2012G I THINK THE ECONOMICS ARE PRETTY CLEAR ON THIS
JulianTreasure_2012G I 'M GLAD THAT DEBATE IS HAPPENING ON THIS I JUST MODERATED A MAJOR CONFERENCE IN LONDON A FEW WEEKS AGO CALLED SOUND EDUCATION WHICH BROUGHT TOGETHER TOP ACOUSTICIANS GOVERNMENT PEOPLE TEACHERS AND SO FORTH WE 'RE AT LAST STARTING TO DEBATE THIS ISSUE
JulianTreasure_2012G OUT OF THAT CONFERENCE INCIDENTALLY ALSO CAME A FREE APP
JulianTreasure_2012G WHICH IS DESIGNED TO HELP CHILDREN STUDY IF THEY 'RE HAVING TO WORK AT HOME FOR EXAMPLE IN A NOISY KITCHEN
JulianTreasure_2012G LET 'S BROADEN THE PERSPECTIVE A LITTLE BIT AND LOOK AT CITIES
JulianTreasure_2012G WE HAVE URBAN PLANNERS WHERE ARE THE URBAN SOUND
JulianTreasure_2012G PLANNERS I DON 'T KNOW OF ONE IN THE WORLD AND THE OPPORTUNITY IS THERE TO TRANSFORM OUR EXPERIENCE IN OUR CITIES THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION ESTIMATES THAT A QUARTER OF EUROPE 'S POPULATION IS HAVING ITS SLEEP DEGRADED BY NOISE IN CITIES WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT
JulianTreasure_2012G AND IN OUR OFFICES WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME AT WORK
JulianTreasure_2012G WHERE ARE THE OFFICE SOUND PLANNERS PEOPLE WHO SAY DON 'T SIT THAT TEAM NEXT TO THIS TEAM BECAUSE THEY LIKE NOISE AND THEY NEED QUIET OR WHO SAY DON 'T SPEND ALL YOUR BUDGET ON A HUGE SCREEN IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM AND THEN PLACE ONE TINY MICROPHONE IN THE MIDDLE OF A TABLE FOR THIRTY PEOPLE LAUGHTER IF YOU CAN HEAR ME YOU CAN UNDERSTAND ME WITHOUT SEEING ME
JulianTreasure_2012G IF YOU CAN SEE ME WITHOUT HEARING ME THAT DOES NOT WORK
JulianTreasure_2012G SO OFFICE SOUND IS A HUGE AREA AND INCIDENTALLY NOISE IN OFFICES HAS BEEN SHOWN TO MAKE PEOPLE LESS HELPFUL LESS ENJOY THEIR TEAMWORK AND LESS PRODUCTIVE AT WORK
JulianTreasure_2012G FINALLY WE HAVE HOMES WE USE INTERIOR DESIGNERS WHERE ARE THE INTERIOR SOUND DESIGNERS HEY LET 'S ALL BE INTERIOR SOUND DESIGNERS
JulianTreasure_2012G TAKE ON LISTENING TO OUR ROOMS AND DESIGNING SOUND THAT 'S EFFECTIVE AND APPROPRIATE MY FRIEND RICHARD MAZUCH AN ARCHITECT IN LONDON COINED THE PHRASE INVISIBLE ARCHITECTURE
JulianTreasure_2012G I LOVE THAT PHRASE IT 'S ABOUT DESIGNING NOT APPEARANCE
JulianTreasure_2012G AND OUR PRODUCTIVITY
JulianTreasure_2012G IT 'S TIME TO START DESIGNING FOR THE EARS THANK YOU
