JamesFlynn_2013 GOING TO TAKE A QUICK VOYAGE OVER THE COGNITIVE HISTORY OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
JamesFlynn_2013 BECAUSE DURING THAT CENTURY OUR MINDS HAVE ALTERED DRAMATICALLY
JamesFlynn_2013 AS YOU ALL KNOW THE CARS THAT PEOPLE DROVE IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED HAVE ALTERED BECAUSE THE ROADS ARE BETTER AND BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY AND OUR MINDS HAVE ALTERED TOO WE 'VE GONE FROM PEOPLE WHO CONFRONTED A CONCRETE WORLD AND ANALYZED THAT WORLD PRIMARILY IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH IT WOULD BENEFIT THEM
JamesFlynn_2013 TO PEOPLE WHO CONFRONT A VERY COMPLEX WORLD AND IT 'S A WORLD WHERE WE 'VE HAD TO DEVELOP NEW MENTAL HABITS NEW HABITS OF MIND AND THESE INCLUDE THINGS LIKE CLOTHING THAT CONCRETE WORLD WITH CLASSIFICATION
JamesFlynn_2013 INTRODUCING ABSTRACTIONS THAT WE TRY TO MAKE LOGICALLY CONSISTENT AND ALSO TAKING THE HYPOTHETICAL SERIOUSLY THAT IS WONDERING ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN RATHER THAN WHAT IS
JamesFlynn_2013 NOW THIS DRAMATIC CHANGE WAS DRAWN TO MY ATTENTION THROUGH MASSIVE I Q GAINS OVER TIME
JamesFlynn_2013 AND THESE HAVE BEEN TRULY MASSIVE
JamesFlynn_2013 THAT IS WE DON 'T JUST GET A FEW MORE QUESTIONS RIGHT ON I Q TESTS WE GET FAR MORE QUESTIONS RIGHT ON I Q TESTS THAN EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION BACK TO THE TIME THAT THEY WERE INVENTED
JamesFlynn_2013 INDEED IF YOU SCORE THE PEOPLE A CENTURY AGO AGAINST MODERN NORMS THEY WOULD HAVE AN AVERAGE I Q OF SEVENTY IF YOU SCORE US AGAINST THEIR NORMS WE WOULD HAVE AN AVERAGE I Q OF ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY
JamesFlynn_2013 NOW THIS HAS RAISED ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS WERE OUR IMMEDIATE ANCESTORS ON THE VERGE OF MENTAL RETARDATION
JamesFlynn_2013 BECAUSE SEVENTY IS NORMALLY THE SCORE FOR MENTAL RETARDATION OR ARE WE ON THE VERGE OF ALL BEING GIFTED BECAUSE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY IS THE CUTTING LINE FOR GIFTEDNESS NOW I 'M GOING TO TRY AND ARGUE FOR A THIRD ALTERNATIVE THAT 'S MUCH MORE ILLUMINATING THAN EITHER OF THOSE
JamesFlynn_2013 AND TO PUT THIS INTO PERSPECTIVE LET 'S IMAGINE THAT A MARTIAN CAME DOWN TO EARTH AND FOUND A RUINED CIVILIZATION
JamesFlynn_2013 AND THIS MARTIAN WAS AN ARCHAEOLOGIST AND THEY FOUND SCORES TARGET SCORES THAT PEOPLE HAD USED FOR SHOOTING
JamesFlynn_2013 AND INITIALLY THAT ARCHAEOLOGIST WOULD BE BAFFLED THEY WOULD SAY LOOK THESE TESTS WERE DESIGNED TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH PEOPLE WERE STEADY OF HAND HOW KEEN THEIR EYESIGHT WAS WHETHER THEY HAD CONTROL OF THEIR WEAPON
JamesFlynn_2013 AND IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS THE EQUIPMENT THAT WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE AVERAGE SOLDIER THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE NOT GREATER KEENNESS OF EYE OR STEADINESS OF
JamesFlynn_2013 LURIA LOOKED AT PEOPLE JUST BEFORE THEY ENTERED THE SCIENTIFIC AGE AND HE FOUND THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE RESISTANT TO CLASSIFYING THE CONCRETE WORLD THEY WANTED TO BREAK IT UP INTO LITTLE BITS THAT THEY COULD USE HE FOUND THAT THEY WERE RESISTANT TO
JamesFlynn_2013 DEDUCING THE HYPOTHETICAL TO SPECULATING ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE AND HE FOUND FINALLY THAT THEY DIDN 'T DEAL WELL WITH ABSTRACTIONS OR USING LOGIC ON THOSE ABSTRACTIONS NOW LET ME GIVE YOU A SAMPLE OF SOME OF HIS INTERVIEWS
JamesFlynn_2013 AND HE WAS INTERESTED EFFECTIVELY IN WHAT HE COULD DO WITH THOSE CONCRETE OBJECTS AND THEN LURIA WENT TO ANOTHER PERSON
JamesFlynn_2013 AND HE SAID TO THEM
JamesFlynn_2013 THERE ARE NO CAMELS IN GERMANY
JamesFlynn_2013 HAMBURG IS A CITY IN GERMANY
JamesFlynn_2013 ARE THERE CAMELS IN HAMBURG
JamesFlynn_2013 AND THE FELLOW SAID WELL IF IT 'S LARGE ENOUGH THERE OUGHT TO BE CAMELS THERE
JamesFlynn_2013 A THIRD INTERVIEW
JamesFlynn_2013 WHEREVER THERE IS ALWAYS SNOW THE BEARS ARE WHITE
JamesFlynn_2013 WHAT COLOR ARE THE BEARS AT THE NORTH POLE
JamesFlynn_2013 AND THE RESPONSE WAS SUCH A THING IS TO BE SETTLED BY TESTIMONY
JamesFlynn_2013 NOW YOU SEE AGAIN THIS PERSON HAS REJECTED GOING BEYOND THE CONCRETE WORLD AND ANALYZING IT THROUGH EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE AND IT WAS IMPORTANT TO THAT PERSON WHAT COLOR BEARS WERE THAT IS THEY HAD TO HUNT BEARS
JamesFlynn_2013 THEY WEREN 'T WILLING TO ENGAGE IN THIS ONE OF THEM SAID TO LURIA HOW CAN WE SOLVE THINGS THAT AREN 'T REAL PROBLEMS
JamesFlynn_2013 NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS ARE REAL HOW CAN WE ADDRESS THEM NOW THESE THREE
JamesFlynn_2013 CATEGORIES CLASSIFICATION
JamesFlynn_2013 FIRST ALMOST ALL OF US TODAY GET A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA THAT IS WE 'VE GONE FROM FOUR TO EIGHT YEARS OF EDUCATION TO TWELVE YEARS OF FORMAL EDUCATION AND FIFTY TWO PERCENT OF AMERICANS HAVE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED SOME TYPE OF TERTIARY EDUCATION
JamesFlynn_2013 NOW NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE MUCH MORE EDUCATION AND MUCH OF THAT EDUCATION IS SCIENTIFIC AND YOU CAN 'T DO SCIENCE WITHOUT CLASSIFYING THE WORLD YOU CAN 'T DO SCIENCE WITHOUT PROPOSING HYPOTHESES YOU CAN 'T DO SCIENCE WITHOUT MAKING IT LOGICALLY CONSISTENT
JamesFlynn_2013 AND EVEN DOWN IN GRADE SCHOOL THINGS HAVE CHANGED
JamesFlynn_2013 AND YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO THINK WELL THE STATE LEGISLATURE WAS RURAL CONTROLLED AND THEY HATED THE BIG CITY
JamesFlynn_2013 SO RATHER THAN PUTTING THE CAPITAL IN A BIG CITY THEY PUT IT IN A COUNTY SEAT THEY PUT IT IN ALBANY RATHER THAN NEW YORK THEY PUT IT IN HARRISBURG RATHER THAN PHILADELPHIA AND SO FORTH
JamesFlynn_2013 WHAT ABOUT EMPLOYMENT
JamesFlynn_2013 WELL IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED THREE PERCENT OF AMERICANS PRACTICED PROFESSIONS THAT WERE COGNITIVELY DEMANDING
JamesFlynn_2013 ONLY THREE PERCENT WERE LAWYERS OR DOCTORS OR TEACHERS
JamesFlynn_2013 TODAY THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF AMERICANS PRACTICE COGNITIVELY DEMANDING PROFESSIONS NOT ONLY TO THE PROFESSIONS PROPER LIKE LAWYER OR DOCTOR OR SCIENTIST OR LECTURER BUT MANY MANY SUB PROFESSIONS HAVING TO DO WITH BEING A TECHNICIAN A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER
JamesFlynn_2013 A WHOLE RANGE OF PROFESSIONS NOW MAKE COGNITIVE DEMANDS
JamesFlynn_2013 AND WE CAN ONLY MEET THE TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE MODERN WORLD BY BEING COGNITIVELY FAR MORE FLEXIBLE
JamesFlynn_2013 COMPARE THE BANKER IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED WHO REALLY JUST NEEDED A GOOD ACCOUNTANT AND TO KNOW WHO WAS TRUSTWORTHY IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY FOR PAYING BACK THEIR MORTGAGE
JamesFlynn_2013 WELL THE MERCHANT BANKERS WHO BROUGHT THE WORLD TO THEIR KNEES MAY HAVE BEEN MORALLY REMISS BUT THEY WERE COGNITIVELY VERY AGILE THEY WENT FAR BEYOND THAT ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED BANKER THEY HAD TO LOOK AT COMPUTER PROJECTIONS FOR THE HOUSING MARKET
JamesFlynn_2013 THEY HAD TO GET COMPLICATED CDO SQUARED IN ORDER TO BUNDLE DEBT TOGETHER AND MAKE DEBT LOOK AS IF IT WERE ACTUALLY A PROFITABLE ASSET THEY HAD TO PREPARE A CASE TO GET RATING AGENCIES TO GIVE IT A AAA THOUGH IN MANY CASES THEY HAD VIRTUALLY BRIBED THE RATING AGENCIES
JamesFlynn_2013 SOME OF THE HABITS OF MIND THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE TWENTIETH CENTURY HAVE PAID OFF IN UNEXPECTED AREAS I 'M PRIMARILY A MORAL PHILOSOPHER I MERELY HAVE A HOLIDAY IN PSYCHOLOGY AND WHAT INTERESTS ME IN GENERAL IS MORAL DEBATE
JamesFlynn_2013 NOW OVER THE LAST CENTURY IN DEVELOPED NATIONS LIKE AMERICA MORAL DEBATE HAS ESCALATED BECAUSE WE TAKE THE HYPOTHETICAL SERIOUSLY AND WE ALSO TAKE UNIVERSALS SERIOUSLY AND LOOK FOR LOGICAL CONNECTIONS
JamesFlynn_2013 WHEN I CAME HOME IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE FROM UNIVERSITY AT THE TIME OF MARTIN LUTHER KING
JamesFlynn_2013 AND WHEN WE SAID TO OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF TOMORROW MORNING YOU WOKE UP BLACK
JamesFlynn_2013 MORES AND ATTITUDES THEY HAD INHERITED THEY WOULD NOT TAKE THE HYPOTHETICAL SERIOUSLY AND WITHOUT THE HYPOTHETICAL IT 'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET MORAL ARGUMENT OFF THE GROUND YOU HAVE TO SAY IMAGINE YOU WERE
JamesFlynn_2013 AND IF SOMEONE OF THE OLDER GENERATION SAYS WELL OUR GOVERNMENT TAKES CARE OF US AND IT 'S UP TO THEIR GOVERNMENT TO TAKE CARE OF THEM
JamesFlynn_2013 WELL YOU TODAY UNIVERSALIZE YOUR PRINCIPLES YOU STATE THEM AS ABSTRACTIONS AND YOU USE LOGIC ON THEM IF YOU HAVE A PRINCIPLE SUCH AS PEOPLE SHOULDN 'T SUFFER UNLESS THEY 'RE GUILTY OF SOMETHING THEN TO EXCLUDE BLACK PEOPLE YOU 'VE GOT TO MAKE EXCEPTIONS DON 'T YOU YOU HAVE TO SAY WELL BLACKNESS OF SKIN
JamesFlynn_2013 YOU COULDN 'T SUFFER JUST FOR THAT IT MUST BE THAT BLACKS ARE SOMEHOW TAINTED
JamesFlynn_2013 BECAUSE YOU 'RE NOT TREATING MORAL PRINCIPLES AS CONCRETE ENTITIES YOU 'RE TREATING THEM AS UNIVERSALS TO BE RENDERED CONSISTENT BY LOGIC
JamesFlynn_2013 NOW HOW DID ALL OF THIS ARISE OUT OF I Q TESTS THAT 'S WHAT INITIALLY GOT ME GOING ON COGNITIVE HISTORY IF YOU LOOK AT THE I Q TEST YOU FIND THE GAINS HAVE BEEN GREATEST IN CERTAIN AREAS THE SIMILARITIES SUBTEST OF THE WECHSLER IS ABOUT CLASSIFICATION
JamesFlynn_2013 THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF THE I Q TEST BATTERY THAT ARE ABOUT USING LOGIC ON ABSTRACTIONS SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE TAKEN RAVEN 'S PROGRESSIVE MATRICES AND IT 'S ALL ABOUT ANALOGIES AND IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE COULD DO SIMPLE ANALOGIES
JamesFlynn_2013 THAT IS IF YOU SAID TO THEM CATS ARE LIKE WILDCATS WHAT ARE DOGS LIKE THEY WOULD SAY WOLVES
JamesFlynn_2013 BUT BY ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY PEOPLE COULD ATTACK RAVEN 'S ON A MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED LEVEL IF YOU SAID WE 'VE GOT TWO SQUARES FOLLOWED BY A TRIANGLE WHAT FOLLOWS TWO CIRCLES THEY COULD SAY A SEMICIRCLE
JamesFlynn_2013 JUST AS A TRIANGLE IS HALF OF A SQUARE A SEMICIRCLE IS HALF OF A CIRCLE BY TWO THOUSAND AND TEN COLLEGE GRADUATES IF YOU SAID
JamesFlynn_2013 THEY WOULD SAY EIGHT BECAUSE EIGHT IS HALF OF SIXTEEN THAT IS THEY
JamesFlynn_2013 NOW I SHOULD SAY ONE THING THAT 'S VERY DISHEARTENING WE HAVEN 'T MADE PROGRESS ON ALL FRONTS ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE WOULD LIKE TO DEAL WITH THE SOPHISTICATION OF THE MODERN WORLD IS THROUGH POLITICS
JamesFlynn_2013 WE 'VE NOTICED IN A TREND AMONG YOUNG AMERICANS THAT THEY READ LESS HISTORY AND LESS LITERATURE AND LESS MATERIAL ABOUT FOREIGN LANDS AND THEY 'RE ESSENTIALLY AHISTORICAL THEY LIVE IN THE BUBBLE OF THE PRESENT
JamesFlynn_2013 THEY DON 'T KNOW THE KOREAN WAR FROM THE WAR IN VIETNAM THEY DON 'T KNOW WHO WAS AN ALLY OF AMERICA IN WORLD WAR II THINK HOW DIFFERENT AMERICA WOULD BE IF EVERY AMERICAN KNEW THAT THIS IS THE FIFTH TIME WESTERN ARMIES HAVE GONE TO AFGHANISTAN TO PUT ITS HOUSE IN ORDER
JamesFlynn_2013 OR IMAGINE HOW DIFFERENT THINGS WOULD BE IF MOST AMERICANS KNEW THAT WE HAD BEEN LIED INTO FOUR OF OUR LAST SIX WARS
JamesFlynn_2013 YOU KNOW THE SPANISH DIDN 'T SINK THE BATTLESHIP MAINE THE LUSITANIA WAS NOT AN INNOCENT VESSEL BUT WAS LOADED WITH MUNITIONS THE NORTH VIETNAMESE DID NOT ATTACK THE SEVENTH FLEET
JamesFlynn_2013 BUT I DON 'T WANT TO END ON A PESSIMISTIC NOTE
JamesFlynn_2013 WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME WHAT WHITE BODIES THE LOWER ORDERS HAVE AS IF THEY WERE A REPTILE WELL DICKENS WAS RIGHT AND HE WAS WRONG
