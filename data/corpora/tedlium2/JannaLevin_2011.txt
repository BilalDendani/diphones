JannaLevin_2011@16.17:25.31 ASK YOU ALL TO CONSIDER FOR A SECOND THE VERY SIMPLE FACT THAT BY FAR MOST OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE UNIVERSE COMES TO US
JannaLevin_2011@25.39:37.33 FROM LIGHT WE CAN STAND ON THE EARTH AND LOOK UP AT THE NIGHT SKY AND SEE STARS WITH OUR BARE EYES THE SUN BURNS OUR PERIPHERAL VISION WE SEE LIGHT REFLECTED OFF THE MOON
JannaLevin_2011@37.33:47.52 AND IN THE TIME SINCE GALILEO POINTED THAT RUDIMENTARY TELESCOPE AT THE CELESTIAL BODIES THE KNOWN UNIVERSE HAS COME TO US THROUGH LIGHT
JannaLevin_2011@55.06:69.96 THIS STUNNING SILENT MOVIE OF THE UNIVERSE THESE SERIES OF SNAPSHOTS THAT GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE BIG BANG AND YET THE UNIVERSE IS NOT A SILENT MOVIE BECAUSE THE UNIVERSE ISN 'T SILENT
JannaLevin_2011@69.96:73.27 I 'D LIKE TO CONVINCE YOU THAT THE UNIVERSE HAS A SOUNDTRACK
JannaLevin_2011@73.27:82.52 AND THAT SOUNDTRACK IS PLAYED ON SPACE ITSELF BECAUSE SPACE CAN WOBBLE LIKE A DRUM IT CAN RING OUT
JannaLevin_2011@89.98:106.08 WE 'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADD TO A KIND OF GLORIOUS VISUAL COMPOSITION THAT WE HAVE OF THE UNIVERSE A SONIC COMPOSITION AND WHILE WE 'VE NEVER HEARD THE SOUNDS FROM SPACE WE REALLY SHOULD IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS START TO TURN UP
JannaLevin_2011@106.08:118.07 THE VOLUME ON WHAT 'S GOING ON OUT THERE SO IN THIS AMBITION TO CAPTURE SONGS FROM THE UNIVERSE WE TURN OUR FOCUS TO BLACK HOLES AND THE PROMISE THEY HAVE BECAUSE BLACK HOLES
JannaLevin_2011@118.07:128.96 CAN BANG ON SPACE TIME LIKE MALLETS ON A DRUM AND HAVE A VERY CHARACTERISTIC SONG WHICH I 'D LIKE TO PLAY FOR YOU SOME OF OUR PREDICTIONS FOR WHAT THAT SONG WILL BE LIKE
JannaLevin_2011@128.96:131.26 NOW BLACK HOLES ARE DARK AGAINST A DARK
JannaLevin_2011@146.07:152.22 BUT THEY WON 'T COME TO US DIRECTLY THROUGH LIGHT WE MIGHT ONE DAY SEE A SHADOW A BLACK HOLE CAN CAST
JannaLevin_2011@152.22:155.5 ON A VERY BRIGHT BACKGROUND BUT WE HAVEN 'T YET
JannaLevin_2011@163.35:174.19 NOW WE OWE THE IDEA THAT SPACE CAN RING LIKE A DRUM TO ALBERT EINSTEIN TO WHOM WE OWE SO MUCH EINSTEIN REALIZED THAT IF SPACE WERE EMPTY IF THE UNIVERSE WERE EMPTY
JannaLevin_2011@174.19:191.77 IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS PICTURE EXCEPT FOR MAYBE WITHOUT THE HELPFUL GRID DRAWN ON IT BUT IF WE WERE FREELY FALLING THROUGH THE SPACE EVEN WITHOUT THIS HELPFUL GRID WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PAINT IT OURSELVES BECAUSE WE WOULD NOTICE THAT WE TRAVELED ALONG STRAIGHT LINES UNDEFLECTED STRAIGHT
JannaLevin_2011@192.06:206.96 THROUGH THE UNIVERSE EINSTEIN ALSO REALIZED AND THIS IS THE REAL MEAT OF THE MATTER THAT IF YOU PUT ENERGY OR MASS IN THE UNIVERSE IT WOULD CURVE SPACE AND A FREELY FALLING OBJECT WOULD PASS BY LET 'S SAY THE SUN
JannaLevin_2011@206.96:214.71 AND IT WOULD BE DEFLECTED ALONG THE NATURAL CURVES IN THE SPACE IT WAS EINSTEIN 'S GREAT GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY
JannaLevin_2011@214.71:226.71 NOW EVEN LIGHT WILL BE BENT BY THOSE PATHS AND YOU CAN BE BENT SO MUCH THAT YOU 'RE CAUGHT IN ORBIT AROUND THE SUN AS THE EARTH IS OR THE MOON AROUND THE EARTH THESE ARE THE NATURAL CURVES IN SPACE
JannaLevin_2011@226.71:243.48 WHAT EINSTEIN DID NOT REALIZE WAS THAT IF YOU TOOK OUR SUN AND YOU CRUSHED IT DOWN TO SIX KILOMETERS SO YOU TOOK A MILLION TIMES THE MASS OF THE EARTH AND YOU CRUSHED IT TO SIX KILOMETERS ACROSS YOU WOULD MAKE A BLACK HOLE AN OBJECT SO DENSE
JannaLevin_2011@243.48:252.09 THAT IF LIGHT VEERED TOO CLOSE IT WOULD NEVER ESCAPE A DARK SHADOW AGAINST THE UNIVERSE IT WASN 'T EINSTEIN WHO REALIZED THIS IT WAS
JannaLevin_2011@268.98:278.82 AND THEN IN BETWEEN CALCULATING EINSTEIN 'S EQUATIONS AS YOU DO IN THE TRENCHES AND HE WAS READING EINSTEIN 'S RECENTLY PUBLISHED GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY
JannaLevin_2011@278.82:291.53 AND HE WAS THRILLED BY THIS THEORY AND HE QUICKLY SURMISED AN EXACT MATHEMATICAL SOLUTION THAT DESCRIBED SOMETHING VERY EXTRAORDINARY CURVES SO STRONG THAT SPACE WOULD RAIN DOWN INTO THEM SPACE
JannaLevin_2011@291.53:311.34 ITSELF WOULD CURVE LIKE A WATERFALL FLOWING DOWN THE THROAT OF A HOLE AND EVEN LIGHT COULD NOT ESCAPE THIS CURRENT LIGHT WOULD BE DRAGGED DOWN THE HOLE AS EVERYTHING ELSE WOULD BE AND ALL THAT WOULD BE LEFT WOULD BE A SHADOW NOW HE WROTE TO EINSTEIN AND HE SAID AS YOU WILL SEE THE WAR HAS BEEN KIND TO ME ENOUGH
JannaLevin_2011@323.32:333.28 DEDICATION OF THE SCIENTIST THIS IS THE HARDWORKING SCIENTIST UNDER HARSH CONDITIONS AND HE TOOK SCHWARZSCHILD 'S IDEA TO THE PRUSSIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES THE NEXT WEEK
JannaLevin_2011@333.28:345.31 BUT EINSTEIN ALWAYS THOUGHT BLACK HOLES WERE A MATHEMATICAL ODDITY HE DID NOT BELIEVE THEY EXISTED IN NATURE HE THOUGHT NATURE WOULD PROTECT US FROM THEIR FORMATION IT WAS DECADES BEFORE THE TERM
JannaLevin_2011@345.31:357.98 BLACK HOLE WAS COINED AND PEOPLE REALIZED THAT BLACK HOLES ARE REAL ASTROPHYSICAL OBJECTS IN FACT THEY 'RE THE DEATH STATE OF VERY MASSIVE STARS THAT COLLAPSE CATASTROPHICALLY AT THE END OF THEIR LIFETIME
JannaLevin_2011@358.2:362.6 NOW OUR SUN WILL NOT COLLAPSE TO A BLACK HOLE IT 'S ACTUALLY NOT MASSIVE ENOUGH
JannaLevin_2011@362.6:366.19 BUT IF WE DID A LITTLE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT AS EINSTEIN WAS VERY FOND
JannaLevin_2011@386.05:397.53 AND YOU WOULD REALIZE YOU COULD PUT THE EARTH IN A HAPPY ORBIT EVEN THIRTY KM OUTSIDE OF THIS CRUSHED BLACK HOLE THIS CRUSHED BLACK HOLE ACTUALLY WOULD FIT INSIDE MANHATTAN MORE OR LESS
JannaLevin_2011@397.53:416.08 IT MIGHT SPILL OFF INTO THE HUDSON A LITTLE BIT BEFORE IT DESTROYED THE EARTH BUT BASICALLY THAT 'S WHAT WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT AN OBJECT THAT YOU COULD CRUSH DOWN TO HALF THE SQUARE AREA OF MANHATTAN SO WE MOVE THIS EARTH VERY CLOSE THIRTY KILOMETERS OUTSIDE AND WE NOTICE IT 'S PERFECTLY FINE ORBITING AROUND THE BLACK HOLE THERE 'S A SORT OF MYTH
JannaLevin_2011@416.08:421.02 THAT BLACK HOLES DEVOUR EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE BUT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO GET VERY CLOSE TO FALL IN
JannaLevin_2011@421.02:424.37 BUT WHAT 'S VERY IMPRESSIVE IS THAT FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT
JannaLevin_2011@424.37:441.59 WE CAN ALWAYS SEE THE EARTH IT CANNOT HIDE BEHIND THE BLACK HOLE THE LIGHT FROM THE EARTH SOME OF IT FALLS IN BUT SOME OF IT GETS LENSED AROUND AND BROUGHT BACK TO US SO YOU CAN 'T HIDE ANYTHING BEHIND A BLACK HOLE IF THIS WERE BATTLESTAR GALACTICA AND YOU 'RE FIGHTING THE CYLONS DON 'T HIDE BEHIND THE BLACK HOLE
JannaLevin_2011@446.62:452.81 COLLAPSE TO A BLACK HOLE IT 'S NOT MASSIVE ENOUGH BUT THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BLACK HOLES IN OUR GALAXY
JannaLevin_2011@452.81:472.63 AND IF ONE WERE TO ECLIPSE THE MILKY WAY THIS IS WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE WE WOULD SEE A SHADOW OF THAT BLACK HOLE AGAINST THE HUNDRED BILLION STARS IN THE MILKY WAY GALAXY AND ITS LUMINOUS DUST LANES AND IF WE WERE TO FALL TOWARDS THIS BLACK HOLE WE WOULD SEE ALL OF THAT LIGHT LENSED AROUND IT AND WE COULD EVEN
JannaLevin_2011@472.63:478.12 START TO CROSS INTO THAT SHADOW AND REALLY NOT NOTICE THAT ANYTHING DRAMATIC HAD HAPPENED
JannaLevin_2011@478.12:491.56 IT WOULD BE BAD IF WE TRIED TO FIRE OUR ROCKETS AND GET OUT OF THERE BECAUSE WE COULDN 'T ANYMORE THAN LIGHT CAN ESCAPE BUT EVEN THOUGH THE BLACK HOLE IS DARK FROM THE OUTSIDE IT 'S NOT DARK ON THE INSIDE BECAUSE ALL OF THE LIGHT FROM THE GALAXY CAN
JannaLevin_2011@491.56:507.65 FALL IN BEHIND US AND EVEN THOUGH DUE TO A RELATIVISTIC EFFECT KNOWN AS TIME DILATION OUR CLOCKS WOULD SEEM TO SLOW DOWN RELATIVE TO GALACTIC TIME IT WOULD LOOK AS THOUGH THE EVOLUTION OF THE GALAXY HAD BEEN SPED UP AND SHOT AT US RIGHT
JannaLevin_2011@518.21:523.58 AND THERE 'S NO WAY OF TELLING ANYBODY ABOUT THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL NOW WE 'VE NEVER
JannaLevin_2011@534.15:546.78 IMAGINE TWO BLACK HOLES THAT HAVE LIVED A LONG LIFE TOGETHER MAYBE THEY STARTED AS STARS AND COLLAPSED TO TWO BLACK HOLES EACH ONE TEN TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN SO NOW WE 'RE GOING TO CRUSH THEM DOWN TO SIXTY KILOMETERS ACROSS
JannaLevin_2011@546.78:561.9 THEY CAN BE SPINNING HUNDREDS OF TIMES A SECOND AT THE END OF THEIR LIVES THEY 'RE GOING AROUND EACH OTHER VERY NEAR THE SPEED OF LIGHT SO THEY 'RE CROSSING THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS IN A FRACTION OF A SECOND AND AS THEY DO SO THEY NOT ONLY CURVE SPACE
JannaLevin_2011@561.9:573.33 BUT THEY LEAVE BEHIND IN THEIR WAKE A RINGING OF SPACE AN ACTUAL WAVE ON SPACE TIME SPACE SQUEEZES AND STRETCHES AS IT EMANATES OUT FROM THESE BLACK HOLES BANGING ON THE UNIVERSE
JannaLevin_2011@573.33:587.24 AND THEY TRAVEL OUT INTO THE COSMOS AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT THIS COMPUTER SIMULATION IS DUE TO A RELATIVITY GROUP AT NASA GODDARD IT TOOK ALMOST THIRTY YEARS FOR ANYONE IN THE WORLD TO CRACK THIS PROBLEM THIS WAS ONE OF THE GROUPS
JannaLevin_2011@587.24:597.6 IT SHOWS TWO BLACK HOLES IN ORBIT AROUND EACH OTHER AGAIN WITH THESE HELPFULLY PAINTED CURVES AND IF YOU CAN SEE IT 'S KIND OF FAINT BUT IF YOU CAN SEE THE RED WAVES EMANATING OUT
JannaLevin_2011@597.6:607.68 THOSE ARE THE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES THEY 'RE LITERALLY THE SOUNDS OF SPACE RINGING AND THEY WILL TRAVEL OUT FROM THESE BLACK HOLES AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT AS THEY RING DOWN AND COALESCE
JannaLevin_2011@607.68:619.87 TO ONE SPINNING QUIET BLACK HOLE AT THE END OF THE DAY IF YOU WERE STANDING NEAR ENOUGH YOUR EAR WOULD RESONATE WITH THE SQUEEZING AND STRETCHING OF SPACE YOU WOULD LITERALLY HEAR THE SOUND
JannaLevin_2011@619.87:621.68 NOW OF COURSE YOUR HEAD WOULD BE SQUEEZED
JannaLevin_2011@643.63:649.18 ON SPACE EACH TIME IT GETS CLOSE IF IT GETS FAR AWAY IT 'S A LITTLE TOO QUIET
JannaLevin_2011@762.29:765.96 BUT THE SOUND IS TOO QUIET FOR ANY OF US TO EVER HEAR
JannaLevin_2011@765.96:784.19 THERE ARE VERY INDUSTRIOUS EXPERIMENTS BEING BUILT ON EARTH ONE CALLED LIGO WHICH WILL DETECT DEVIATIONS IN THE SQUEEZING AND STRETCHING OF SPACE AT LESS THAN THE FRACTION OF A NUCLEUS OF AN ATOM OVER FOUR KILOMETERS IT 'S A REMARKABLY AMBITIOUS EXPERIMENT AND IT 'S GOING TO BE AT ADVANCED
JannaLevin_2011@784.19:793.21 SENSITIVITY WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS TO PICK THIS UP THERE 'S ALSO A MISSION PROPOSED FOR SPACE WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL LAUNCH IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS CALLED LISA
JannaLevin_2011@793.21:812.38 AND LISA WILL BE ABLE TO SEE SUPER MASSIVE BLACK HOLES BLACK HOLES MILLIONS OR BILLIONS OF TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN IN THIS HUBBLE IMAGE WE SEE TWO GALAXIES THEY LOOK LIKE THEY 'RE FROZEN IN SOME EMBRACE AND EACH ONE PROBABLY HARBORS A SUPER MASSIVE BLACK HOLE AT ITS CORE
JannaLevin_2011@826.46:833.96 BUT LISA COULD SEE THE FINAL STAGES OF TWO SUPER MASSIVE BLACK HOLES EARLIER IN THE UNIVERSE 'S HISTORY THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES
JannaLevin_2011@833.97:835.75 BEFORE THEY FALL TOGETHER
JannaLevin_2011@835.75:853.13 AND IT 'S NOT JUST BLACK HOLES BUT IT 'S ALSO ANY BIG DISTURBANCE IN THE UNIVERSE AND THE BIGGEST OF THEM ALL IS THE BIG BANG WHEN THAT EXPRESSION WAS COINED IT WAS DERISIVE LIKE OH WHO WOULD BELIEVE IN A BIG BANG BUT NOW IT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE MORE TECHNICALLY ACCURATE BECAUSE IT MIGHT BANG IT MIGHT MAKE A SOUND
JannaLevin_2011@853.13:871.12 THIS ANIMATION FROM MY FRIENDS AT PROTON STUDIOS SHOWS LOOKING AT THE BIG BANG FROM THE OUTSIDE WE DON 'T EVER WANT TO DO THAT ACTUALLY WE WANT TO BE INSIDE THE UNIVERSE BECAUSE THERE 'S NO SUCH THING AS STANDING OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSE SO IMAGINE YOU 'RE INSIDE THE BIG BANG IT 'S EVERYWHERE IT 'S ALL AROUND YOU AND THE SPACE IS WOBBLING CHAOTICALLY
JannaLevin_2011@871.12:875.42 FOURTEEN BILLION YEARS PASS AND THIS SONG IS STILL RINGING ALL AROUND US
JannaLevin_2011@875.42:886.47 GALAXIES FORM AND GENERATIONS OF STARS FORM IN THOSE GALAXIES AND AROUND ONE STAR AT LEAST ONE STAR IS A HABITABLE PLANET AND HERE WE ARE
JannaLevin_2011@886.47:890.99 FRANTICALLY BUILDING THESE EXPERIMENTS DOING THESE CALCULATIONS WRITING THESE COMPUTER CODES
JannaLevin_2011@925.24:929.73 IT 'S A TERRIBLE SOUND IT 'S LITERALLY THE DEFINITION OF NOISE IT 'S WHITE NOISE
JannaLevin_2011@932.36:947.22 EVERYWHERE PRESUMABLY IF IT HASN 'T BEEN WIPED OUT BY SOME OTHER PROCESS IN THE UNIVERSE AND IF WE PICK IT UP IT WILL BE MUSIC TO OUR EARS BECAUSE IT WILL BE THE QUIET ECHO OF THAT MOMENT OF OUR CREATION OF OUR OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE
JannaLevin_2011@947.22:957.93 SO WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE 'LL BE ABLE TO TURN UP THE SOUNDTRACK A LITTLE BIT RENDER THE UNIVERSE IN AUDIO BUT IF WE DETECT THOSE EARLIEST MOMENTS
JannaLevin_2011@957.93:970.64 IT 'LL BRING US THAT MUCH CLOSER TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIG BANG WHICH BRINGS US THAT MUCH CLOSER TO ASKING SOME OF THE HARDEST MOST ELUSIVE QUESTIONS IF WE RUN THE MOVIE OF OUR UNIVERSE BACKWARDS
JannaLevin_2011@970.64:973.69 WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS A BIG BANG IN OUR PAST
JannaLevin_2011@973.69:977.35 AND WE MIGHT EVEN HEAR THE CACOPHONOUS SOUND OF IT
JannaLevin_2011@996.77:1016.49 IS IT POSSIBLE THAT OUR UNIVERSE IS JUST A PLUME OFF OF SOME GREATER HISTORY OR IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE 'RE JUST A BRANCH OFF OF A MULTIVERSE EACH BRANCH WITH ITS OWN BIG BANG IN ITS PAST MAYBE SOME OF THEM WITH BLACK HOLES PLAYING DRUMS MAYBE SOME WITHOUT MAYBE SOME WITH SENTIENT LIFE AND MAYBE SOME WITHOUT
JannaLevin_2011@1016.49:1020.97 NOT IN OUR PAST NOT IN OUR FUTURE BUT SOMEHOW FUNDAMENTALLY CONNECTED TO US
JannaLevin_2011@1020.97:1027.84 SO WE HAVE TO WONDER IF THERE IS A MULTIVERSE IN SOME OTHER PATCH OF THAT MULTIVERSE ARE THERE CREATURES
JannaLevin_2011@1027.84:1045.34 HERE 'S MY MULTIVERSE CREATURES ARE THERE OTHER CREATURES IN THE MULTIVERSE WONDERING ABOUT US AND WONDERING ABOUT THEIR OWN ORIGINS AND IF THEY ARE I CAN IMAGINE THEM AS WE ARE CALCULATING WRITING COMPUTER CODE BUILDING INSTRUMENTS
JannaLevin_2011@1045.34:1048.93 TRYING TO DETECT THAT FAINTEST SOUND
