DanielKahneman_2010@15.8:18.33 EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT HAPPINESS THESE DAYS
DanielKahneman_2010@18.33:19.462 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanielKahneman_2010@19.462:25.282 I HAD SOMEBODY COUNT THE NUMBER OF BOOKS WITH HAPPINESS IN THE TITLE PUBLISHED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS
DanielKahneman_2010@25.282:29.75 AND THEY GAVE UP AFTER ABOUT FORTY AND THERE WERE MANY MORE
DanielKahneman_2010@29.75:38.57 THERE IS A HUGE WAVE OF INTEREST IN HAPPINESS AMONG RESEARCHERS THERE IS A LOT OF HAPPINESS COACHING EVERYBODY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPIER
DanielKahneman_2010@38.57:40.068 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanielKahneman_2010@40.068:48.52 BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THIS FLOOD OF WORK THERE ARE SEVERAL COGNITIVE TRAPS THAT SORT OF MAKE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK STRAIGHT ABOUT HAPPINESS
DanielKahneman_2010@48.52:62.11 AND MY TALK TODAY WILL BE MOSTLY ABOUT THESE COGNITIVE TRAPS THIS APPLIES TO LAYPEOPLE THINKING ABOUT THEIR OWN HAPPINESS AND IT APPLIES TO SCHOLARS THINKING ABOUT HAPPINESS BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT WE 'RE JUST AS MESSED UP AS ANYBODY ELSE IS
DanielKahneman_2010@62.11:63.424 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanielKahneman_2010@63.424:76.34 THE FIRST OF THESE TRAP IS A RELUCTANCE TO ADMIT COMPLEXITY IT TURNS OUT THAT THE WORD HAPPINESS IS JUST NOT A USEFUL WORD ANYMORE BECAUSE WE APPLY IT TO TOO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS
DanielKahneman_2010@76.34:88.99 I THINK THERE IS ONE PARTICULAR MEANING FOR TO WHICH WE MIGHT RESTRICT IT BUT BY AND LARGE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE 'LL HAVE TO GIVE UP AND WE 'LL HAVE TO ADOPT THE MORE COMPLICATED VIEW OF WHAT WELL BEING IS
DanielKahneman_2010@88.99:104.99 THE SECOND TRAP IS A CONFUSION BETWEEN EXPERIENCE AND MEMORY BASICALLY IT 'S BETWEEN BEING HAPPY IN YOUR LIFE AND BEING HAPPY ABOUT YOUR LIFE OR HAPPY WITH YOUR LIFE AND THOSE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT CONCEPTS AND THEY 'RE BOTH LUMPED IN THE NOTION OF HAPPINESS
DanielKahneman_2010@104.99:119.79 AND THE THIRD IS IT 'S THE FOCUSING ILLUSION AND IT 'S THE UNFORTUNATE FACT THAT WE CAN 'T THINK ABOUT ANY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT AFFECTS WELL BEING WITHOUT DISTORTING ITS IMPORTANCE I MEAN THIS IS A REAL COGNITIVE TRAP THERE 'S JUST NO WAY OF GETTING IT RIGHT
DanielKahneman_2010@119.79:121.27 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanielKahneman_2010@121.27:126.79 NOW I 'D LIKE TO START WITH AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEBODY
DanielKahneman_2010@126.79:130.64 WHO HAD A QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION AFTER ONE OF MY LECTURES
DanielKahneman_2010@130.64:136.48 REPORTED A STORY AND THAT WAS THE STORY HE SAID HE 'D BEEN LISTENING TO THE SYMPHONY
DanielKahneman_2010@136.48:146.77 AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS MUSIC AND AT THE VERY END OF THE RECORDING THERE WAS A DREADFUL SCREECHING SOUND AND THEN HE ADDED REALLY QUITE EMOTIONALLY
DanielKahneman_2010@146.77:149.82 IT RUINED THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE
DanielKahneman_2010@149.82:152.51 BUT IT HADN'T
DanielKahneman_2010@152.51:168.19 WHAT IT HAD RUINED WERE THE MEMORY OF THE EXPERIENCE HE HAD HAD THE EXPERIENCE HE HAD HAD TWENTY MINUTES OF GLORIOUS MUSIC THEY COUNTED FOR NOTHING BECAUSE HE WAS LEFT WITH A MEMORY THE MEMORY WAS RUINED AND THE MEMORY WAS ALL THAT HE HAD GOTTEN TO KEEP
DanielKahneman_2010@168.19:178.63 WHAT THIS IS TELLING US REALLY IS THAT WE MIGHT BE THINKING OF OURSELVES AND OF OTHER PEOPLE IN TERMS OF TWO SELVES THERE IS AN EXPERIENCING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010@178.63:181.98 WHO LIVES IN THE PRESENT
DanielKahneman_2010@181.98:196.32 AND KNOWS THE PRESENT IS CAPABLE OF RE LIVING THE PAST BUT BASICALLY IT HAS ONLY THE PRESENT IT 'S THE EXPERIENCING SELF THAT THE DOCTOR APPROACHES YOU KNOW WHEN THE DOCTOR ASKS DOES IT HURT NOW WHEN I TOUCH YOU HERE
DanielKahneman_2010@196.32:198.93 AND THEN THERE IS A REMEMBERING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010@198.93:202.82 AND THE REMEMBERING SELF IS THE ONE THAT KEEPS SCORE
DanielKahneman_2010@202.82:207.93 AND MAINTAINS THE STORY OF OUR LIFE AND IT 'S THE ONE THAT THE DOCTOR
DanielKahneman_2010@207.93:210.56 APPROACHES IN ASKING THE QUESTION
DanielKahneman_2010@210.56:212.49 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanielKahneman_2010@212.49:221.188 HOW HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING LATELY OR HOW WAS YOUR TRIP TO ALBANIA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THOSE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT ENTITIES THE EXPERIENCING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010@221.188:228.29 AND THE AND THE REMEMBERING SELF AND GETTING CONFUSED BETWEEN THEM IS PART OF THE MESS OF THE NOTION OF HAPPINESS
DanielKahneman_2010@228.29:229.6 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanielKahneman_2010@229.6:233.41 NOW THE REMEMBERING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010@233.41:237.8 IS A STORYTELLER AND THAT REALLY STARTS WITH A BASIC
DanielKahneman_2010@237.8:251.12 RESPONSE OF OUR MEMORY IT STARTS IMMEDIATELY WE DON 'T ONLY TELL STORIES WHEN WE SET OUT TO TELL STORIES OUR MEMORY TELLS US STORIES THAT IS WHAT WE GET TO KEEP FROM OUR EXPERIENCES IS A STORY
DanielKahneman_2010@251.12:254.982 AND LET ME BEGIN WITH ONE EXAMPLE
DanielKahneman_2010@254.982:268.23 THIS IS AN OLD STUDY THOSE ARE ACTUAL PATIENTS UNDERGOING A PAINFUL PROCEDURE I WON 'T GO INTO DETAIL IT 'S NO LONGER PAINFUL THESE DAYS BUT IT WAS PAINFUL WHEN THIS WHEN THIS STUDY WAS RUN IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES
DanielKahneman_2010@268.23:277.008 THEY WERE ASKED TO REPORT ON THEIR PAIN EVERY SIXTY SECONDS AND HERE ARE TWO PATIENTS THOSE ARE THEIR RECORDINGS AND YOU ARE ASKED
DanielKahneman_2010@277.008:286.362 WHO OF THEM SUFFERED MORE AND IT 'S A VERY EASY QUESTION I MEAN CLEARLY PATIENT B SUFFERED MORE HIS COLONOSCOPY WAS LONGER AND EVERY
DanielKahneman_2010@286.362:293.16 MINUTE OF PAIN THAT PATIENT A HAD PATIENT B HAD AND MORE BUT NOW THERE IS ANOTHER QUESTION
DanielKahneman_2010@293.16:296.31 HOW MUCH DID THESE PATIENTS THINK THEY SUFFERED
DanielKahneman_2010@296.31:296.98 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanielKahneman_2010@296.98:298.59 AND HERE IS A SURPRISE
DanielKahneman_2010@298.59:309.156 AND THE SURPRISE IS THAT PATIENT A HAD A MUCH WORSE MEMORY OF THE COLONOSCOPY THAN PATIENT B THE STORIES OF THE COLONOSCOPIES WERE DIFFERENT
DanielKahneman_2010@309.156:315.11 AND BECAUSE A VERY CRITICAL PART OF THE STORY IS HOW IT ENDS
DanielKahneman_2010@315.11:330.46 AND NEITHER OF THESE STORIES IS VERY INSPIRING OR GREAT BUT BUT ONE OF THEM IS DISTINCT BUT ONE OF THEM IS DISTINCTLY WORSE THAN THE OTHER AND THE ONE THAT IS WORSE IS THE ONE WHERE PAIN WAS AT ITS PEAK AT THE VERY END
DanielKahneman_2010@330.46:344.486 IT 'S A BAD STORY HOW DO WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE ASKED THESE PEOPLE AFTER THEIR COLONOSCOPY AND MUCH LATER TOO HOW BAD WAS THE WHOLE THING IN TOTAL AND IT WAS MUCH WORSE FOR A THAN FOR B IN MEMORY
DanielKahneman_2010@344.486:354.46 NOW THIS IS A DIRECT CONFLICT BETWEEN THE EXPERIENCING SELF AND THE REMEMBERING SELF FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF CLEARLY B HAD A WORSE TIME
DanielKahneman_2010@354.46:371.322 NOW WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH PATIENT A AND WE ACTUALLY RAN CLINICAL EXPERIMENTS AND IT HAS BEEN DONE AND IT DOES WORK YOU COULD ACTUALLY EXTEND THE COLONOSCOPY OF PATIENT A BY JUST KEEPING THE TUBE IN WITHOUT JIGGLING IT TOO MUCH THAT WILL
DanielKahneman_2010@371.322:384.78 CAUSE THE PATIENT TO SUFFER BUT JUST A LITTLE AND MUCH LESS THAN BEFORE AND IF YOU DO THAT FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES YOU HAVE MADE THE EXPERIENCING SELF OF PATIENT A WORSE OFF
DanielKahneman_2010@384.78:391.74 AND YOU HAVE THE REMEMBERING SELF OF PATIENT A AND LOT BETTER OFF BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE ENDOWED PATIENT A
DanielKahneman_2010@391.74:395.89 WITH A BETTER STORY ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE
DanielKahneman_2010@395.89:396.856 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanielKahneman_2010@396.856:399.58 WHAT DEFINES A STORY
DanielKahneman_2010@399.58:417.69 AND THAT IS TRUE OF THE STORIES THAT MEMORY DELIVERS FOR US AND IT 'S ALSO TRUE OF THE STORIES THAT WE MAKE UP WHAT DEFINES A STORY ARE CHANGES SIGNIFICANT MOMENTS AND ENDINGS ENDINGS ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND IN THIS CASE YOU KNOW THE ENDING DOMINATED
DanielKahneman_2010@417.69:419.146 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanielKahneman_2010@419.146:423.39 NOW THE EXPERIENCING SELF LIVES ITS LIFE
DanielKahneman_2010@423.39:433.1 CONTINUOUSLY IT HAS MOMENTS OF EXPERIENCE ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND YOU CAN ASK WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE MOMENTS AND THE ANSWER IS REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD
DanielKahneman_2010@433.1:448.06 THEY ARE LOST FOREVER I MEAN MOST OF THE MOMENTS OF OUR LIFE AND I CALCULATED YOU KNOW THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESENT IS SAID TO BE ABOUT THREE SECONDS LONG WHICH MEANS THAT YOU KNOW IN IN A LIFE THERE ARE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION OF THEM IN A MONTH THERE ARE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND
DanielKahneman_2010@448.06:449.178 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanielKahneman_2010@449.178:456.1 MOST OF THEM DON 'T LEAVE A TRACE MOST OF THEM ARE COMPLETELY IGNORED BY THE REMEMBERING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010@456.1:460.088 AND YET SOMEHOW YOU GET THE SENSE THAT THEY SHOULD COUNT
DanielKahneman_2010@460.088:464.96 THAT WHAT HAPPENS DURING THESE MOMENTS OF EXPERIENCE IS OUR LIFE
DanielKahneman_2010@464.96:469.734 IT 'S THE FINITE RESOURCE THAT WE 'RE SPENDING WHILE WE 'RE ON THIS EARTH
DanielKahneman_2010@469.734:479.05 AND HOW TO SPEND IT WOULD SEEM TO BE RELEVANT BUT THAT IS NOT THE STORY THAT THE REMEMBERING SELF KEEPS FOR US SO WE HAVE THE
DanielKahneman_2010@479.05:487.33 REMEMBERING SELF AND THE EXPERIENCING SELF AND THEY 'RE REALLY QUITE DISTINCT THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IS IN THE HANDLING OF TIME
DanielKahneman_2010@487.33:488.596 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanielKahneman_2010@488.596:497.412 FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF IF YOU HAVE A VACATION AND THE SECOND WEEK IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST THEN
DanielKahneman_2010@497.412:508.58 THE TWO WEEK VACATION IS TWICE AS GOOD AS THE ONE WEEK VACATION THAT 'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS AT ALL FOR THE REMEMBERING SELF FOR THE REMEMBERING SELF A TWO WEEK VACATION IS BARELY BETTER
DanielKahneman_2010@508.58:514.682 THAN THE ONE WEEK VACATION BECAUSE THERE ARE NO NEW MEMORIES ADDED YOU HAVE NOT CHANGED THE STORY
DanielKahneman_2010@514.682:528.33 AND IN THIS WAY TIME IS ACTUALLY THE CRITICAL VARIABLE THAT DISTINGUISHES A REMEMBERING SELF FROM AN EXPERIENCING SELF TIME HAS VERY LITTLE IMPACT ON THIS STORY
DanielKahneman_2010@528.33:529.956 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanielKahneman_2010@529.956:538.09 NOW THE REMEMBERING SELF DOES MORE THAN REMEMBER AND TELL STORIES IT IS ACTUALLY THE ONE THAT MAKES DECISIONS
DanielKahneman_2010@538.09:547.894 BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A PATIENT WHO HAS HAD SAY TWO COLONOSCOPIES WITH TWO DIFFERENT SURGEONS AND IS DECIDING WHICH OF THEM TO CHOOSE THEN
DanielKahneman_2010@547.894:555.75 THE ONE THAT CHOOSES IS THE ONE THAT HAS YOU KNOW THE MEMORY THAT IS LESS BAD AND THAT 'S THE THE SURGEON THAT WILL BE CHOSEN
DanielKahneman_2010@555.75:568.97 THE EXPERIENCING SELF HAS NO VOICE IN THIS CHOICE WE ACTUALLY DON 'T CHOOSE BETWEEN EXPERIENCES WE CHOOSE BETWEEN MEMORIES OF EXPERIENCES AND EVEN WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE
DanielKahneman_2010@568.97:577.032 WE DON 'T THINK OF OUR FUTURE NORMALLY AS EXPERIENCES WE THINK OF OUR FUTURE AS ANTICIPATED MEMORIES
DanielKahneman_2010@577.032:582.368 AND BASICALLY YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS YOU KNOW AS A TYRANNY OF THE REMEMBERING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010@582.368:590.588 AND YOU CAN THINK OF THE REMEMBERING SELF SORT OF DRAGGING THE EXPERIENCING SELF THROUGH EXPERIENCES THAT THE EXPERIENCING SELF DOESN 'T NEED
DanielKahneman_2010@590.588:597.28 I HAVE THAT SENSE THAT WHEN WE GO ON VACATIONS THIS IS VERY FREQUENTLY THE CASE THAT IS THAT IT 'S
DanielKahneman_2010@597.28:603.1 WE WE GO ON VACATIONS TO A VERY LARGE EXTENT IN THE SERVICE OF OUR REMEMBERING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010@603.1:604.084 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanielKahneman_2010@604.084:607.484 AND THIS IS A BIT HARD TO JUSTIFY I THINK I MEAN I
DanielKahneman_2010@607.484:615.67 HOW MUCH DO WE CONSUME OUR MEMORIES THAT IS ONE OF THE EXPLANATIONS THAT IS GIVEN FOR THE DOMINANCE OF THE REMEMBERING SELF AND
DanielKahneman_2010@615.67:624.83 WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT I THINK ABOUT A VACATION WE HAD IN ANTARCTICA A FEW YEARS AGO WHICH WAS CLEARLY THE BEST VACATION I 'VE EVER HAD AND I THINK OF IT RELATIVELY OFTEN
DanielKahneman_2010@624.83:628.832 RELATIVE TO HOW MUCH I THINK OF OTHER VACATIONS AND
DanielKahneman_2010@628.832:644.2 I PROBABLY HAVE CONSUMED MY MEMORIES OF THAT THREE WEEK TRIP I WOULD SAY FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS NOW YOU KNOW IF IF I HAD EVER OPENED THE FOLDER WITH THE SIX HUNDRED PICTURES IN IT I WOULD HAVE SPENT ANOTHER HOUR
DanielKahneman_2010@644.2:648.47 NOW THAT IS THREE WEEKS AND THAT IS AT MOST AN HOUR AND A HALF
DanielKahneman_2010@648.47:657.87 THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISCREPANCY NOW I MAY BE A BIT EXTREME YOU KNOW IN HOW LITTLE APPETITE I HAVE FOR CONSUMING MEMORIES BUT EVEN IF YOU DO MORE OF THIS
DanielKahneman_2010@657.87:661.054 THERE IS A GENUINE QUESTION
DanielKahneman_2010@661.054:673.07 WHY DO WE PUT SO MUCH WEIGHT ON MEMORY RELATIVE TO THE WEIGHT THAT WE PUT ON EXPERIENCES SO I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT
DanielKahneman_2010@673.07:681.02 IMAGINE THAT FOR YOUR NEXT VACATION YOU KNOW THAT AT THE END OF THE THE VACATION ALL YOUR PICTURES WILL BE DESTROYED
DanielKahneman_2010@681.02:688.834 AND YOU 'LL GET AN AMNESIC DRUG SO THAT YOU WON 'T REMEMBER ANYTHING NOW WOULD YOU CHOOSE THE SAME VACATION
DanielKahneman_2010@688.834:694.13 AND AND IF AND IF YOU WOULD CHOOSE A DIFFERENT VACATION
DanielKahneman_2010@694.13:704.842 THERE IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN YOUR TWO SELVES AND YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO ADJUDICATE THAT CONFLICT AND IT 'S ACTUALLY NOT AT ALL OBVIOUS BECAUSE IF YOU THINK IN TERMS OF TIME
DanielKahneman_2010@704.842:713.1 THEN YOU GET ONE ANSWER AND IF YOU THINK IN TERMS OF MEMORIES YOU MIGHT GET ANOTHER ANSWER
DanielKahneman_2010@713.1:721.07 WHY DO WE PICK THEM THE VACATIONS WE DO IS A PROBLEM THAT CONFRONTS US YOU KNOW WITH A CHOICE BETWEEN THE TWO SELVES
DanielKahneman_2010@721.07:731.678 NOW THE TWO SELVES BRING UP TWO NOTIONS OF HAPPINESS THERE ARE REALLY TWO CONCEPTS OF HAPPINESS THAT WE CAN APPLY ONE PER SELF
DanielKahneman_2010@731.678:740.77 AND SO YOU CAN ASK HOW HAPPY IS THE EXPERIENCING SELF AND THEN YOU WOULD ASK HOW HAPPY ARE THE MOMENTS IN THE EXPERIENCING SELF 'S LIFE
DanielKahneman_2010@740.77:750.91 AND THEY 'RE ALL HAPPINESS FOR MOMENTS IS A FAIRLY COMPLICATED PROCESS WHAT ARE THE EMOTIONS THAT CAN BE MEASURED AND BY THE WAY NOW WE ARE CAPABLE OF
DanielKahneman_2010@750.91:756.76 GETTING A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF THE HAPPINESS OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF OVER TIME
DanielKahneman_2010@756.76:758.594 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanielKahneman_2010@758.594:773.612 IF YOU ASK FOR THE HAPPINESS OF THE REMEMBERING SELF IT 'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING THIS IS NOT ABOUT HOW HAPPILY A PERSON LIVES IT IS ABOUT HOW SATISFIED OR PLEASED THE PERSON IS WHEN THAT PERSON THINKS ABOUT HER LIFE
DanielKahneman_2010@773.612:783.81 VERY DIFFERENT NOTIONS ANYONE WHO DOESN 'T DISTINGUISH THOSE NOTIONS IS GOING TO MESS UP THE STUDY OF HAPPINESS AND I BELONG TO A CROWD OF STUDENTS OF WELL BEING
DanielKahneman_2010@783.81:798.564 WHO 'VE BEEN MESSING UP THE STUDY OF HAPPINESS FOR A LONG TIME IN PRECISELY THIS WAY THE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE HAPPINESS OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF AND THE SATISFACTION OF THE REMEMBERING SELF HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN RECENT YEARS
DanielKahneman_2010@798.564:811.5 AND THERE ARE NOW EFFORTS TO MEASURE THE TWO SEPARATELY THE GALLUP ORGANIZATION HAS A WORLD POLL WITH MORE THAT HALF A MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK OF THEIR LIFE AND ABOUT
DanielKahneman_2010@811.5:820.878 THEIR EXPERIENCES AND THERE THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER EFFORTS ALONG THOSE LINES SO IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE BEGUN TO LEARN ABOUT THE HAPPINESS OF THE TWO SELVES
DanielKahneman_2010@820.878:826.68 AND THE MAIN LESSON I THINK THAT WE HAVE LEARNED IS THEY ARE REALLY DIFFERENT
DanielKahneman_2010@826.68:836.342 YOU CAN KNOW HOW SATISFIED SOMEBODY IS WITH THEIR LIFE AND THAT REALLY DOESN 'T TEACH YOU MUCH ABOUT HOW HAPPILY THEY 'RE LIVING THEIR LIFE
DanielKahneman_2010@836.342:848.668 AND VICE VERSA YOU KNOW JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE CORRELATION THE CORRELATION IS ABOUT POINT FIVE WHAT THAT MEANS IS IF YOU MET SOMEBODY AND YOU WERE TOLD OH HIS FATHER IS SIX FEET TALL
DanielKahneman_2010@848.668:858.95 WOULD HOW MUCH WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT HIS HEIGHT WELL YOU WOULD KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT HIS HEIGHT BUT THERE 'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY YOU HAVE THAT MUCH UNCERTAINTY IF I TELL YOU THAT SOMEBODY
DanielKahneman_2010@858.95:867.02 RANKED THEIR LIFE EIGHT ON A SCALE OF TEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW HAPPY THEY ARE WITH THEIR EXPERIENCING SELF
DanielKahneman_2010@867.02:882.35 SO THE CORRELATION IS LOW WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT CONTROLS SATISFACTION OF THE HAPPINESS SELF WE KNOW THAT MONEY IS VERY IMPORTANT GOALS ARE VERY IMPORTANT WE KNOW THAT HAPPINESS IS MAINLY
DanielKahneman_2010@882.35:885.6 BEING SATISFIED WITH PEOPLE THAT WE LIKE
DanielKahneman_2010@885.6:896.69 SPENDING TIME WITH PEOPLE THAT WE LIKE THERE ARE OTHER PLEASURES BUT THIS IS DOMINANT SO IF YOU WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE HAPPINESS OF THE TWO SELVES YOU ARE GOING TO END UP DOING VERY DIFFERENT THINGS
DanielKahneman_2010@896.69:907.68 THE BOTTOM LINE OF WHAT I 'VE SAID HERE IS THAT WE REALLY SHOULD NOT THINK OF HAPPINESS AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR WELL BEING IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NOTION
DanielKahneman_2010@907.68:908.998 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanielKahneman_2010@908.998:917.16 NOW VERY QUICKLY ANOTHER REASON WE CANNOT THINK STRAIGHT ABOUT HAPPINESS IS THAT
DanielKahneman_2010@917.16:919.274 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanielKahneman_2010@919.274:930.25 WE DO NOT ATTEND THE SAME TO THE SAME THINGS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT LIFE AND WE ACTUALLY LIVE SO IF YOU ASK THE SIMPLE QUESTION OF HOW HAPPY PEOPLE ARE IN CALIFORNIA
DanielKahneman_2010@930.25:942.24 YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET TO THE CORRECT ANSWER WHEN YOU ASK THAT QUESTION YOU THINK PEOPLE MUST BE HAPPIER IN CALIFORNIA IF IF SAY YOU LIVE IN OHIO
DanielKahneman_2010@942.24:952.758 AND WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT LIVING IN CALIFORNIA YOU ARE THINKING OF THE CONTRAST BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER PLACES
DanielKahneman_2010@952.758:965.882 AND THAT CONTRAST SAY IS IN CLIMATE WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT CLIMATE IS NOT VERY IMPORTANT TO THE EXPERIENCING SELF AND IS NOT EVEN VERY IMPORTANT TO THE REFLECTIVE SELF THAT DECIDES HOW HAPPY PEOPLE ARE
DanielKahneman_2010@965.882:970.57 BUT NOW BECAUSE THE REFLECTIVE SELF IS IN CHARGE
DanielKahneman_2010@970.57:980.708 YOU MAY END UP SOME PEOPLE MAY END UP MOVING TO CALIFORNIA AND IT 'S SORT OF INTERESTING TO TRACE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO PEOPLE WHO MOVE TO CALIFORNIA IN THE HOPE OF GETTING HAPPIER
DanielKahneman_2010@980.708:985.588 WELL THEIR EXPERIENCING SELF IS NOT GOING TO GET HAPPIER WE KNOW THAT

DanielKahneman_2010@998.222:1006.27 AND THEY WILL FEEL THEY MADE THE RIGHT DECISION IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO THINK STRAIGHT ABOUT WELL BEING AND

DanielKahneman_2010@1024.85:1030.49 YOU MENTIONED TO ME THAT THERE WAS QUITE AN INTERESTING RESULT CAME OUT OF THAT GALLUP SURVEY
DanielKahneman_2010@1030.49:1034.21 IS THAT IS THAT SOMETHING YOU CAN SHARE SINCE YOU DO HAVE A FEW MOMENTS LEFT NOW SURE
DanielKahneman_2010@1034.21:1046.44 SURE I THINK THE MOST INTERESTING RESULT THAT WE FOUND IN THE GALLUP SURVEY IS A NUMBER WHICH WE ABSOLUTELY DID NOT EXPECT TO FIND WE FOUND THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE HAPPINESS OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF

DanielKahneman_2010@1054.19:1068.44 AND IT TURNS OUT THAT BELOW AN INCOME OF SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR AMERICANS AND THAT 'S A VERY LARGE SAMPLE OF AMERICANS LIKE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND SO IT 'S A LARGE REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE BELOW AN INCOME OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
DanielKahneman_2010@1068.44:1069.39 SIX SIXTY THOUSAND

DanielKahneman_2010@1072.72:1086.16 SIXTY THOUSAND SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR PEOPLE ARE UNHAPPY AND THEY GET PROGRESSIVELY UNHAPPIER THE POORER THEY GET ABOVE THAT WE GET AN ABSOLUTELY FLAT LINE I MEAN I 'VE RARELY SEEN LINES SO FLAT
DanielKahneman_2010@1086.16:1094.48 CLEARLY WHAT IS HAPPENING IS MONEY DOES NOT BUY YOU EXPERIENTIAL HAPPINESS BUT LACK OF MONEY CERTAINLY BUYS YOU MISERY
DanielKahneman_2010@1094.48:1099.37 AND WE CAN MEASURE THAT MISERY VERY VERY CLEARLY IN TERMS OF
DanielKahneman_2010@1099.37:1108.1 THE OTHER SELF THE REMEMBERING SELF YOU GET A DIFFERENT STORY THE MORE MONEY YOU EARN THE MORE SATISFIED YOU ARE THAT DOES NOT HOLD FOR EMOTIONS

DanielKahneman_2010@1122.74:1132.73 YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE TAXATION POLICY AND SO FORTH IS IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT POLITICIANS THAT THE COUNTRY GENERALLY WOULD TAKE A FINDING LIKE THAT SERIOUSLY AND RUN PUBLIC POLICY BASED ON IT
DanielKahneman_2010@1132.73:1146.82 YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THERE IS RECOGNITION OF THE ROLE OF HAPPINESS RESEARCH IN PUBLIC POLICY THE RECOGNITION IS GOING TO BE SLOW IN THE UNITED STATES NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT BUT IN THE UK IT IS HAPPENING AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES IT IS HAPPENING
DanielKahneman_2010@1146.82:1152.96 PEOPLE ARE RECOGNIZING THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE THINKING OF POLICY OF HAPPINESS WHEN THEY THINK OF PUBLIC POLICY

DanielKahneman_2010@1153.68:1167.55 IT 'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE AND IT 'S NOT GOING TO AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DEBATE WHETHER THEY WANT TO STUDY EXPERIENCE HAPPINESS OR WHETHER THEY WANT TO STUDY LIFE EVALUATION SO WE NEED TO HAVE THAT DEBATE FAIRLY SOON HOW TO ENHANCE HAPPINESS
DanielKahneman_2010@1167.55:1180.16 GOES VERY DIFFERENT WAYS DEPENDING ON HOW YOU THINK AND WHETHER YOU THINK OF THE REMEMBERING SELF OR YOU THINK OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF THIS IS GOING TO INFLUENCE POLICY I THINK IN YEARS TO COME IN THE UNITED STATES EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE
DanielKahneman_2010@1180.16:1188.29 TO MEASURE THE EXPERIENCE HAPPINESS OF THE POPULATION THIS IS GOING TO BE I THINK WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE OR TWO PART OF NATIONAL STATISTICS
DanielKahneman_2010@1188.29:1192.25 WELL IT SEEMS TO ME THIS ISSUE WILL OR AT LEAST SHOULD BE
