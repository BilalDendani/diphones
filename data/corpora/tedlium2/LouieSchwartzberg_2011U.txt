LouieSchwartzberg_2011U@16.52:27.01 HERE AT TED YOU KNOW I THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME PRESENTATIONS THAT WILL GO OVER MY HEAD BUT THE MOST AMAZING CONCEPTS ARE THE ONES THAT GO RIGHT UNDER MY FEET
LouieSchwartzberg_2011U@27.01:34.6 THE LITTLE THINGS IN LIFE SOMETIMES THAT WE FORGET ABOUT LIKE POLLINATION THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED
LouieSchwartzberg_2011U@34.6:54.3 AND YOU CAN 'T TELL THE STORY ABOUT POLLINATORS BEES BATS HUMMINGBIRDS BUTTERFLIES WITHOUT TELLING THE STORY ABOUT THE INVENTION OF FLOWERS AND HOW THEY CO EVOLVED OVER FIFTY MILLION YEARS I 'VE BEEN FILMING TIME LAPSE FLOWERS TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FOR OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS
LouieSchwartzberg_2011U@54.32:66.9 TO WATCH THEM MOVE IS A DANCE I 'M NEVER GOING TO GET TIRED OF IT FILLS ME WITH WONDER AND IT OPENS MY HEART BEAUTY AND SEDUCTION I BELIEVE IS NATURE 'S TOOL FOR SURVIVAL
LouieSchwartzberg_2011U@67.15:75.09 BECAUSE WE WILL PROTECT WHAT WE FALL IN LOVE WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS A LOVE STORY THAT FEEDS THE EARTH
LouieSchwartzberg_2011U@75.09:80.48 IT REMINDS US THAT WE ARE A PART OF NATURE AND WE 'RE NOT SEPARATE FROM IT
LouieSchwartzberg_2011U@80.48:97.43 WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THE VANISHING BEES COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER IT MOTIVATED ME TO TAKE ACTION WE DEPEND ON POLLINATORS FOR OVER A THIRD OF THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WE EAT AND MANY SCIENTISTS BELIEVE IT 'S THE MOST SERIOUS ISSUE FACING MANKIND
LouieSchwartzberg_2011U@97.43:102.66 IT 'S LIKE THE CANARY IN THE COALMINE IF THEY DISAPPEAR SO DO WE
LouieSchwartzberg_2011U@102.66:107.61 IT REMINDS US THAT WE ARE A PART OF NATURE AND WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF IT
LouieSchwartzberg_2011U@107.89:119.66 WHAT MOTIVATED ME TO FILM THEIR BEHAVIOR WAS SOMETHING THAT I ASKED MY SCIENTIFIC ADVISERS WHAT MOTIVATES THE POLLINATORS WELL THEIR ANSWER WAS
LouieSchwartzberg_2011U@119.74:125.03 IT 'S ALL ABOUT RISK AND REWARD LIKE A WIDE EYED KID I 'D SAY WHY IS THAT
LouieSchwartzberg_2011U@125.04:127.61 AND THEY 'D SAY WELL BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SURVIVE
LouieSchwartzberg_2011U@147.07:165.89 AND THAT BLEW MY MIND BECAUSE I REALIZED THAT NATURE HAD INVENTED REPRODUCTION AS A MECHANISM FOR LIFE TO MOVE FORWARD AS A LIFE FORCE THAT PASSES RIGHT THROUGH US AND MAKES US A LINK IN THE EVOLUTION OF LIFE RARELY SEEN BY THE NAKED EYE
LouieSchwartzberg_2011U@165.99:171.56 THIS INTERSECTION BETWEEN THE ANIMAL WORLD AND THE PLANT WORLD IS TRULY A MAGIC MOMENT
LouieSchwartzberg_2011U@171.99:178.04 IT 'S THE MYSTICAL MOMENT WHERE LIFE REGENERATES ITSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN
LouieSchwartzberg_2011U@178.04:197.14 SO HERE IS SOME NECTAR FROM MY FILM I HOPE YOU 'LL DRINK TWEET AND PLANT SOME SEEDS TO POLLINATE A FRIENDLY GARDEN AND ALWAYS TAKE TIME TO SMELL THE FLOWERS AND LET IT FILL YOU WITH BEAUTY AND REDISCOVER THAT SENSE OF WONDER HERE ARE SOME IMAGES
