RomulusWhitaker_2009I@16.98:24.09 OFF YOUR PRECONCEPTIONS YOUR PRECONCEIVED FEARS AND THOUGHTS ABOUT REPTILES BECAUSE
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@25.48:34.07 MY STORY ACROSS TO YOU AND BY THE WAY IF I COME ACROSS AS A SORT OF RABID HIPPIE CONSERVATIONIST IT'S PURELY A FIGMENT OF YOUR IMAGINATION
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@39.85:46.63 OKAY WE ARE ACTUALLY THE FIRST SPECIES ON EARTH TO BE SO PROLIFIC TO ACTUALLY THREATEN OUR OWN SURVIVAL
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@47.73:54.51 AND I KNOW WE'VE ALL SEEN IMAGES ENOUGH TO MAKE US NUMB OF THE TRAGEDIES THAT WE'RE PERPETRATING ON THE PLANET
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@55.66:63.12 GREEDY KIDS USING IT ALL UP AREN'T WE AND TODAY IS A TIME FOR ME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WATER
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@76.58:88.83 BUT FOR SEVERAL OTHER REASONS AS WELL WHEN I WAS A KID GROWING UP IN NEW YORK I WAS SMITTEN BY SNAKES THE SAME WAY MOST KIDS ARE SMITTEN BY TOPS MARBLES CARS TRAINS CRICKET BALLS AND MY MOTHER
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@90.27:102.66 WAS PARTLY TO BLAME TAKING ME TO THE NEW YORK NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM BUYING ME BOOKS ON SNAKES AND THEN STARTING THIS INFAMOUS CAREER OF MINE WHICH HAS CULMINATED IN OF COURSE
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@103.40:112.47 ARRIVING IN INDIA SIXTY YEARS AGO BROUGHT BY MY MOTHER DORIS NORDEN AND MY STEPFATHER RAMA CHATTOPADHYAYA IT'S BEEN A ROLLER COASTER RIDE
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@126.22:135.16 AND THIS CHARISMATIC SNAKE THE KING COBRA TALK TODAY REALLY IS IS TO SORT OF INDELIBLY SCAR YOUR MINDS
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@146.24:154.36 THE KING COBRA IS QUITE REMARKABLE FOR SEVERAL REASONS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE IS VERY RECENTLY SHOT IMAGES IN A FOREST NEARBY HERE
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@154.88:162.79 OF A FEMALE KING COBRA MAKING HER NEST HERE IS A LIMBLESS ANIMAL CAPABLE OF GATHERING A HUGE MOUND OF LEAVES AND THEN LAYING HER EGGS INSIDE
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@162.96:173.23 TO WITHSTAND FIVE TO TEN IN ORDER THAT THE EGGS CAN INCUBATE OVER THE NEXT NINETY DAYS AND HATCH INTO LITTLE BABY KING COBRAS SO SHE PROTECTS HER EGGS
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@173.90:185.38 AND AFTER THREE MONTHS THE BABIES FINALLY DO HATCH OUT A MAJORITY OF THEM WILL DIE OF COURSE THERE IS VERY HIGH MORTALITY IN LITTLE BABY REPTILES WHO ARE JUST TEN TO TWELVE INCHES LONG
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@186.10:193.68 MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH KING COBRAS WAS IN SEVENTY TWO AT A MAGICAL PLACE CALLED AGUMBE IN KARNATAKA THIS STATE
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@194.24:207.03 AND IT IS A MARVELOUS RAIN FOREST THIS FIRST ENCOUNTER WAS KIND OF LIKE THE MASAI BOY WHO KILLS THE LION TO BECOME A WARRIOR IT REALLY CHANGED MY LIFE TOTALLY
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@207.29:216.82 AND IT BROUGHT ME STRAIGHT INTO THE CONSERVATION FRAY I ENDED UP STARTING THIS RESEARCH AND EDUCATION STATION IN AGUMBE WHICH YOU ARE ALL OF COURSE INVITED TO VISIT
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@217.75:231.59 THIS IS BASICALLY A BASE WHEREIN WE ARE TRYING TO GATHER AND LEARN VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING ABOUT THE BIODIVERSITY OF THIS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX FOREST SYSTEM AND TRY TO HANG ON TO WHAT'S THERE MAKE SURE THE WATER SOURCES ARE PROTECTED AND KEPT CLEAN
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@231.85:241.51 AND OF COURSE HAVING A GOOD TIME TOO YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR THE DRUMS THROBBING BACK IN THAT LITTLE COTTAGE WHERE WE STAY WHEN WE'RE THERE
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@242.45:253.55 IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET THROUGH TO THE PEOPLE AND THROUGH THE CHILDREN IS USUALLY THE WAY TO GO THEY ARE FASCINATED WITH SNAKES THEY HAVEN'T GOT THAT STEELY THING THAT YOU END UP
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@254.10:261.85 EITHER FEARING OR HATING OR DESPISING OR LOATHING THEM IN SOME WAY THEY ARE INTERESTED AND IT REALLY WORKS TO START WITH THEM THIS
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@277.20:286.64 CAUGHT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED KING COBRAS OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS AND RELOCATED THEM IN NEARBY FORESTS BUT IN ORDER TO FIND OUT THE REAL SECRETS OF THESE CREATURES
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@287.55:299.75 FOR US TO ACTUALLY INSERT A SMALL RADIO TRANSMITTER INSIDE SNAKE NOW WE ARE ABLE TO FOLLOW THEM AND FIND OUT THEIR SECRETS WHERE THE BABIES GO AFTER THEY HATCH AND
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@303.60:319.11 THIS WAS JUST A FEW DAYS AGO IN AGUMBE I HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING CLOSE TO THIS LARGE KING COBRA WHO HAD CAUGHT A VENOMOUS PIT VIPER AND IT DOES IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT DOESN'T GET BITTEN ITSELF AND KING COBRAS FEED ONLY ON SNAKES
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@326.63:339.04 USUALLY THEY EAT SOMETHING A BIT LARGER IN THIS CASE A RATHER STRANGE AND INEXPLICABLE ACTIVITY HAPPENED OVER THE LAST BREEDING SEASON WHEREIN A LARGE MALE KING COBRA ACTUALLY GRABBED A FEMALE KING COBRA
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@357.30:368.40 THIS MALE SNAKE TWELVE FEET LONG MET ANOTHER MALE KING COBRA AND THEY DID THIS INCREDIBLE RITUAL COMBAT DANCE IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE THE RUTTING OF MAMMALS INCLUDING HUMANS YOU KNOW SORTING OUT OUR DIFFERENCES
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@368.64:378.27 BUT GENTLER NO BITING ALLOWED IT'S JUST A WRESTING MATCH BUT A REMARKABLE ACTIVITY NOW WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH ALL THIS INFORMATION WHAT'S THE POINT OF ALL THIS
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@378.95:387.13 WELL THE KING COBRA IS LITERALLY A KEYSTONE SPECIES IN THESE RAINFORESTS AND OUR JOB IS TO CONVINCE THE AUTHORITIES
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@387.54:399.04 THAT THESE FORESTS HAVE TO BE PROTECTED AND THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS WE DO IT BY LEARNING AS MUCH AS WE CAN ABOUT SOMETHING SO REMARKABLE AND SO ICONIC IN THE RAINFORESTS THERE IN ORDER TO HELP PROTECT
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@399.64:406.89 TREES ANIMALS AND OF COURSE THE WATER SOURCES YOU'VE ALL HEARD PERHAPS OF PROJECT TIGER WHICH STARTED BACK IN THE EARLY
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@417.14:425.53 BUT WHO ALSO HAD AN INCREDIBLE PASSION FOR ENVIRONMENT AND THIS IS THE TIME WHEN PROJECT TIGER EMERGED AND JUST LIKE PROJECT TIGER
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@426.38:435.51 OUR ACTIVITY WITH THE KING COBRA IS TO A SPECIES OF ANIMAL SO THAT WE PROTECT ITS HABITAT AND EVERYTHING WITHIN IT SO THE TIGER IS THE ICON
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@435.89:446.89 AND NOW THE KING COBRA IS A NEW ONE ALL THE MAJOR RIVERS IN SOUTH INDIA ARE SOURCED IN THE WESTERN GHATS THE CHAIN OF HILLS RUNNING ALONG THE WEST COAST OF INDIA
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@447.70:458.88 IT POURS OUT MILLIONS OF GALLONS EVERY HOUR AND SUPPLIES DRINKING WATER TO AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE AND WASHES MANY MANY BABIES AND OF COURSE
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@473.09:487.14 IN PERIL OF YOUR LIFE AND THE THING IS IT'S NOT JUST BIG INDUSTRY IT'S NOT MISGUIDED RIVER ENGINEERS WHO ARE DOING ALL THIS IT'S US IT SEEMS THAT OUR CITIZENS FIND THE BEST WAY TO DISPOSE OF GARBAGE ARE IN WATER SOURCES
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@488.54:496.33 NOW WE'RE GOING NORTH VERY FAR NORTH NORTH CENTRAL INDIA THE CHAMBAL RIVER IS WHERE WE HAVE OUR BASE THIS IS THE HOME OF THE GHARIAL THIS INCREDIBLE
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@498.61:508.57 IT IS AN ANIMAL WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE EARTH FOR JUST ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS IT SURVIVED EVEN DURING THE TIME THAT THE DINOSAURS DIED OFF
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@508.99:523.22 IT HAS REMARKABLE FEATURES EVEN THOUGH IT GROWS TO TWENTY FEET LONG SINCE IT EATS ONLY FISH IT'S NOT DANGEROUS TO HUMAN BEINGS IT DOES HAVE BIG TEETH HOWEVER AND IT'S KIND OF HARD TO CONVINCE PEOPLE IF AN ANIMAL HAS BIG TEETH THAT IT'S A HARMLESS CREATURE BUT
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@524.14:532.42 WE ACTUALLY BACK IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES DID SURVEYS AND FOUND THAT GHARIAL WERE EXTREMELY RARE
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@532.93:546.86 IN FACT IF YOU SEE THE MAP THE RANGE OF THEIR ORIGINAL HABITAT WAS ALL THE WAY FROM THE INDUS IN PAKISTAN TO THE IRRAWADDY IN BURMA AND NOW IT'S JUST LIMITED TO A COUPLE OF SPOTS IN NEPAL AND INDIA SO
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@547.50:559.66 IN FACT AT THIS POINT THERE ARE ONLY TWO HUNDRED BREEDING GHARIAL LEFT IN THE WILD SO STARTING IN THE MID SEVENTIES WHEN CONSERVATION WAS AT THE FORE WE WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO START PROJECTS
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@560.16:571.68 WHICH WERE BASICALLY GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED TO COLLECT EGGS FROM THE WILD FROM THE FEW REMAINING NESTS AND RELEASE FIVE THOUSAND BABY GHARIAL BACK TO THE WILD AND PRETTY SOON WE WERE SEEING SIGHTS LIKE THIS
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@572.35:577.54 I MEAN JUST INCREDIBLE TO SEE BUNCHES OF GHARIAL BASKING ON THE RIVER AGAIN BUT
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@587.85:600.56 VERY VERY HEAVY CULTIVATION ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE RIVER 'S EDGE NOT ALLOWING THE ANIMALS TO BREED ANYMORE WE'RE LOOKING AT EVEN MORE PROBLEMS BUILDING UP FOR THE GHARIAL DESPITE THE EARLY GOOD
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@603.11:610.38 THEIR NESTS HATCHING ALONG THE RIVERSIDE PRODUCING HUNDREDS OF HATCHLINGS IT'S JUST AN AMAZING SIGHT THIS WAS ACTUALLY JUST TAKEN LAST YEAR
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@610.79:618.44 BUT THEN THE MONSOON ARRIVES AND UNFORTUNATELY DOWNRIVER THERE IS ALWAYS A DAM OR THERE IS ALWAYS A BARRAGE
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@623.91:633.90 A LOT OF INTEREST MY PALS IN THE CROCODILE SPECIALIST GROUP OF THE IUCN THE AN NGO THE WORLD WILDLIFE FUND THE WILDLIFE INSTITUTE OF INDIA STATE FOREST DEPARTMENTS
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@634.30:643.20 AND THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT WE ALL WORK TOGETHER ON STUFF BUT IT'S POSSIBLY AND DEFINITELY NOT ENOUGH FOR EXAMPLE
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@643.90:651.80 IN THE WINTER OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THERE WAS THIS INCREDIBLE DIE OFF OF GHARIAL IN THE CHAMBAL RIVER SUDDENLY DOZENS OF GHARIAL
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@664.63:678.45 SO IN ORDER TO TRY TO FIND OUT THE ANSWER TO THIS WE GOT VETERINARIANS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD WORKING WITH INDIAN VETS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING I WAS THERE FOR A LOT OF THE NECROPSIES ON THE RIVERSIDE AND WE ACTUALLY LOOKED THROUGH
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@679.28:689.03 ALL THEIR ORGANS AND TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND IT CAME DOWN TO SOMETHING CALLED GOUT WHICH AS A RESULT OF KIDNEY BREAKDOWN IS ACTUALLY URIC ACID CRYSTALS
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@689.41:698.04 THROUGHOUT THE BODY AND WORSE IN THE JOINTS WHICH MADE THE GHARIAL UNABLE TO SWIM AND IT'S A HORRIBLY PAINFUL DEATH
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@698.97:711.95 JUST DOWNRIVER FROM THE CHAMBAL IS THE FILTHY YAMUNA RIVER THE SACRED YAMUNA RIVER AND I HATE TO BE SO IRONIC AND SARCASTIC ABOUT IT BUT IT'S THE TRUTH IT'S JUST ONE OF THE FILTHIEST CESSPOOLS YOU CAN IMAGINE IF FLOWS DOWN THROUGH
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@713.59:724.76 MATHURA AGRA AND GETS JUST ABOUT EVERY BIT OF EFFLUENT YOU CAN IMAGINE SO IT SEEMED THAT THE TOXIN THAT WAS KILLING THE GHARIAL WAS SOMETHING IN THE FOOD CHAIN SOMETHING IN THE FISH THEY WERE EATING
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@725.17:734.28 AND YOU KNOW ONCE A TOXIN IS IN THE FOOD CHAIN EVERYTHING IS AFFECTED INCLUDING US BECAUSE THESE RIVERS ARE THE LIFEBLOOD OF PEOPLE ALL ALONG THEIR COURSE
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@734.89:741.84 IN ORDER TO TRY TO ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS WE AGAIN TURN TO TECHNOLOGY TO BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGY IN THIS CASE AGAIN
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@742.88:751.48 PUTTING RADIOS ON TEN GHARIAL AND ACTUALLY FOLLOWING THEIR MOVEMENTS THEY'RE BEING WATCHED EVERYDAY AS WE SPEAK TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT THIS MYSTERIOUS TOXIN
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@753.05:763.13 THE CHAMBAL RIVER IS AN ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE PLACE IT'S A PLACE THAT'S FAMOUS TO A LOT OF YOU WHO KNOW ABOUT THE BANDITS THE DACOITS WHO USED TO
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@771.94:778.30 GET TO SEE THE INCREDIBLE LANDSCAPE AS WELL BUT AGAIN HEAVY FISHING PRESSURES
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@778.96:787.02 THIS IS ONE OF THE LAST REPOSITORIES OF THE GANGES RIVER DOLPHIN VARIOUS SPECIES OF TURTLES THOUSANDS OF MIGRATORY BIRDS
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@787.58:798.90 AND FISHING IS CAUSING PROBLEMS LIKE THIS AND NOW NEW ELEMENTS OF HUMAN INTOLERANCE FOR RIVER CREATURES LIKE THE GHARIAL MEANS THAT
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@800.76:810.43 IF THEY DON'T DROWN IN THE NET THEN THEY SIMPLY CUT THEIR BEAKS OFF ANIMALS LIKE THE GANGES RIVER DOLPHIN WHICH IS JUST DOWN TO A FEW LEFT AND IT IS ALSO CRITICALLY ENDANGERED SO WHO IS NEXT US
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@811.34:822.37 BECAUSE WE ARE ALL DEPENDENT ON THESE WATER SOURCES SO WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE NARMADA RIVER THE TRAGEDIES OF DAMS THE TRAGEDIES OF HUGE PROJECTS WHICH DISPLACE PEOPLE AND WRECK RIVER SYSTEMS
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@831.25:841.76 SO WE'RE NOT SURE WHERE THIS STORY IS GOING TO END WHETHER IT'S GOT A HAPPY OR SAD ENDING AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS CERTAINLY GOING TO TURN ALL OF OUR THEORIES AND PREDICTIONS ON THEIR HEADS
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@849.92:857.04 YOU KNOW THE DECISION MAKERS THE FOLKS IN POWER THEY'RE UP IN THEIR BUNGALOWS AND SO ON IN DELHI IN THE CITY CAPITALS THEY ARE ALL SUPPLIED WITH PLENTY OF WATER
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@858.64:864.87 BUT OUT ON THE RIVERS THERE ARE STILL MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN REALLY BAD SHAPE AND IT'S A BLEAK FUTURE FOR THEM
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@865.43:873.39 SO WE HAVE OUR GANGES AND YAMUNA CLEAN UP PROJECT WE'VE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON IT AND NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT INCREDIBLE
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@874.04:884.67 SO PEOPLE TALK ABOUT POLITICAL WILL DURING THE DIEOFF OF THE GHARIAL WE DID GALVANIZE A LOT OF ACTION GOVERNMENT CUT THROUGH ALL THE RED TAPE WE GOT FOREIGN VETS ON IT IT WAS GREAT SO WE CAN DO IT
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@885.63:898.96 BUT IF YOU STROLL DOWN TO THE YAMUNA OR TO THE GOMATI IN LUCKNOW OR TO THE ADYAR RIVER IN CHENNAI OR THE MULA MUTA RIVER IN PUNE JUST SEE WHAT WE'RE CAPABLE OF DOING TO A RIVER IT'S SAD
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@899.94:907.34 BUT I THINK THE FINAL NOTE REALLY IS THAT WE CAN DO IT THE CORPORATES THE ARTISTS THE
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@909.05:918.94 THE GOOD OLD EVERYDAY FOLKS CAN ACTUALLY BRING THESE RIVERS BACK AND THE FINAL WORD IS THAT THERE IS A KING COBRA LOOKING OVER OUR SHOULDERS
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@919.67:928.97 AND THERE IS A GHARIAL LOOKING AT US FROM THE RIVER AND THESE ARE POWERFUL WATER TOTEMS AND THEY ARE GOING TO DISTURB OUR DREAMS UNTIL WE DO THE RIGHT THING
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@954.07:964.78 I TAKE THE SORT OF HUMBLE APPROACH I GUESS YOU COULD SAY I DON'T SAY THAT SNAKES ARE HUGGABLE EXACTLY IT'S NOT LIKE THE TEDDY BEAR BUT I
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@975.86:983.77 AS A CREATURE WHO IS TOTALLY FRIGHTENED OF SOMETHING SO DANGEROUS AS A HUMAN BEING AND THAT IS THE TRUTH AND THAT'S WHAT I TRY TO GET
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@992.39:1001.82 THIS IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST TIME ANYONE OF US KNEW ABOUT IT FOR ONE THING AS I SAID IT'S JUST LIKE A LITTLE SNACK FOR HIM YOU KNOW USUALLY THEY EAT LARGER SNAKES LIKE RAT SNAKES OR EVEN COBRAS
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@1002.17:1010.95 BUT THIS GUY WHO WE'RE FOLLOWING RIGHT NOW IS IN THE DEEP JUNGLE WHEREAS OTHER KING COBRAS VERY OFTEN COME INTO THE HUMAN INTERFACE YOU KNOW THE PLANTATIONS
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@1011.09:1020.28 TO FIND BIG RAT SNAKES AND STUFF THIS GUY SPECIALIZES IN PIT VIPERS AND THE GUY WHO IS WORKING THERE WITH THEM HE 'S FROM MAHARASHTRA HE SAID I THINK HE 'S AFTER
RomulusWhitaker_2009I@1022.62:1026.56 THE NUSHA MEANS THE HIGH WHENEVER HE EATS THE PIT VIPER HE GETS THIS LITTLE
