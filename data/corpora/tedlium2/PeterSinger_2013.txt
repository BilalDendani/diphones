PeterSinger_2013 FOOTAGE TOO GRAPHIC TO BE SHOWN
PeterSinger_2013 THE ENTIRE ACCIDENT IS CAUGHT ON CAMERA THE DRIVER PAUSES AFTER HITTING THE CHILD HIS BACK WHEELS SEEN RESTING ON HER FOR OVER A SECOND
PeterSinger_2013 WITHIN TWO MINUTES THREE PEOPLE PASS TWO YEAR OLD WANG YUE BY THE FIRST WALKS AROUND THE BADLY INJURED TODDLER COMPLETELY OTHERS LOOK AT HER BEFORE MOVING OFF
PeterSinger_2013 THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WALKED PAST WANG YUE AND A SECOND VAN RAN OVER HER LEGS BEFORE A STREET CLEANER RAISED
PeterSinger_2013 I WONDER HOW MANY OF YOU LOOKING AT THAT SAID TO YOURSELVES JUST NOW
PeterSinger_2013 I WOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT I WOULD HAVE STOPPED TO HELP RAISE YOUR HANDS IF THAT THOUGHT OCCURRED TO YOU AS I THOUGHT THAT 'S MOST OF YOU AND I BELIEVE YOU I 'M SURE YOU 'RE RIGHT
PeterSinger_2013 BUT BEFORE YOU GIVE YOURSELF TOO MUCH CREDIT
PeterSinger_2013 LOOK AT THIS UNICEF REPORTS THAT IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN
PeterSinger_2013 SIX POINT NINE MILLION CHILDREN UNDER FIVE
PeterSinger_2013 DIED FROM PREVENTABLE POVERTY RELATED
PeterSinger_2013 I DON 'T THINK IT DOES MAKE A MORALLY RELEVANT DIFFERENCE
PeterSinger_2013 AND THE ANSWER IS YES WE CAN EACH OF US
PeterSinger_2013 SPENDS MONEY ON THINGS THAT WE DO NOT REALLY NEED YOU CAN THINK WHAT YOUR OWN HABIT IS WHETHER IT 'S A NEW CAR A VACATION OR JUST SOMETHING LIKE BUYING BOTTLED WATER WHEN THE WATER THAT COMES OUT OF THE TAP IS PERFECTLY SAFE TO DRINK
PeterSinger_2013 YOU COULD TAKE THE MONEY YOU 'RE SPENDING ON THOSE UNNECESSARY THINGS AND GIVE IT TO THIS ORGANIZATION
PeterSinger_2013 THE AGAINST MALARIA FOUNDATION
PeterSinger_2013 AND USE IT TO BUY NETS LIKE THIS ONE TO PROTECT CHILDREN LIKE THIS ONE
PeterSinger_2013 AND WE KNOW RELIABLY THAT IF WE PROVIDE NETS
PeterSinger_2013 FORTUNATELY MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE UNDERSTANDING THIS IDEA AND THE RESULT IS A GROWING MOVEMENT EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM IT 'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT COMBINES BOTH THE HEART AND THE HEAD THE HEART OF COURSE YOU FELT YOU FELT THE EMPATHY FOR THAT CHILD
PeterSinger_2013 BUT IT 'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO USE THE HEAD AS WELL
PeterSinger_2013 TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT YOU DO IS EFFECTIVE AND WELL DIRECTED AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT ALSO I THINK REASON HELPS US
PeterSinger_2013 TO UNDERSTAND THAT OTHER PEOPLE WHEREVER THEY ARE ARE LIKE US
PeterSinger_2013 SO I THINK REASON IS NOT JUST SOME NEUTRAL TOOL TO HELP YOU GET WHATEVER YOU WANT IT DOES HELP US TO PUT PERSPECTIVE ON OUR SITUATION
PeterSinger_2013 AND I THINK THAT 'S WHY MANY OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PEOPLE IN EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM
PeterSinger_2013 HAVE BEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD BACKGROUNDS IN PHILOSOPHY OR ECONOMICS OR MATH AND THAT MIGHT SEEM SURPRISING BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK PHILOSOPHY IS REMOTE FROM THE REAL WORLD ECONOMICS WE 'RE TOLD JUST MAKES US MORE SELFISH
PeterSinger_2013 AND WE KNOW THAT MATH IS FOR NERDS
PeterSinger_2013 BUT IN FACT IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND IN FACT THERE 'S ONE PARTICULAR NERD WHO HAS BEEN A PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE
PeterSinger_2013 THAT 'S THE UNDERSTANDING THE RATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF OUR SITUATION IN THE WORLD THAT HAS LED TO THESE PEOPLE BEING THE MOST EFFECTIVE ALTRUISTS IN HISTORY BILL AND MELINDA GATES AND WARREN BUFFETT
PeterSinger_2013 HAS EVER GIVEN AS MUCH TO CHARITY AS EACH ONE OF THESE THREE
PeterSinger_2013 AND THEY HAVE USED THEIR INTELLIGENCE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE
PeterSinger_2013 ACCORDING TO ONE ESTIMATE THE GATES FOUNDATION HAS ALREADY SAVED FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION LIVES AND MANY MILLIONS MORE PEOPLE GETTING DISEASES THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THEM VERY SICK EVEN IF EVENTUALLY
PeterSinger_2013 WELL YOU MIGHT SAY THAT 'S FINE IF YOU 'RE A BILLIONAIRE YOU CAN HAVE THAT KIND OF IMPACT BUT IF I 'M NOT WHAT CAN I DO SO I 'M GOING TO LOOK AT FOUR QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE ASK THAT MAYBE STAND IN THE WAY OF THEM GIVING
PeterSinger_2013 THEY WORRY HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE THEY CAN MAKE BUT YOU DON 'T HAVE TO BE A BILLIONAIRE THIS IS TOBY ORD
PeterSinger_2013 HE 'S A RESEARCH FELLOW IN PHILOSOPHY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD
PeterSinger_2013 HE BECAME AN EFFECTIVE ALTRUIST WHEN HE CALCULATED THAT WITH THE MONEY THAT HE WAS LIKELY TO EARN THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER AN ACADEMIC CAREER HE COULD GIVE ENOUGH
PeterSinger_2013 TO CURE EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE OF BLINDNESS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND STILL
PeterSinger_2013 HAVE ENOUGH LEFT FOR A PERFECTLY ADEQUATE STANDARD OF LIVING SO TOBY FOUNDED AN ORGANIZATION CALLED GIVING WHAT WE CAN TO SPREAD THIS INFORMATION TO UNITE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SHARE SOME OF THEIR INCOME AND TO ASK PEOPLE TO PLEDGE TO GIVE TEN PERCENT
PeterSinger_2013 OF WHAT THEY EARN OVER THEIR LIFETIME TO FIGHTING GLOBAL POVERTY
PeterSinger_2013 TOBY HIMSELF DOES BETTER THAN THAT
PeterSinger_2013 HE 'S PLEDGED TO LIVE ON EIGHTEEN THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR THAT 'S LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
PeterSinger_2013 AND TO GIVE THE REST TO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AND YES TOBY IS MARRIED AND HE DOES HAVE A MORTGAGE
PeterSinger_2013 THIS IS A COUPLE AT A LATER STAGE OF LIFE CHARLIE BRESLER AND DIANA SCHOTT WHO WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG WHEN THEY MET WERE ACTIVISTS AGAINST THE VIETNAM WAR
PeterSinger_2013 AND THEN MOVED INTO CAREERS AS MOST PEOPLE DO DIDN 'T REALLY DO ANYTHING VERY ACTIVE ABOUT THOSE VALUES ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN 'T ABANDON THEM AND THEN AS THEY GOT TO THE AGE AT WHICH MANY PEOPLE START TO THINK OF RETIREMENT
PeterSinger_2013 THEY RETURNED TO THEM AND THEY 'VE DECIDED TO CUT BACK ON THEIR SPENDING TO LIVE MODESTLY AND TO GIVE BOTH MONEY AND TIME
PeterSinger_2013 TO HELPING TO FIGHT GLOBAL POVERTY
PeterSinger_2013 ONE PERSON WHO 'S THOUGHT QUITE A BIT ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF HOW YOU CAN HAVE A CAREER THAT WILL HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD IS WILL CROUCH
PeterSinger_2013 HE 'S A GRADUATE STUDENT IN PHILOSOPHY AND HE 'S SET UP A WEBSITE
PeterSinger_2013 CALLED EIGHTY THOUSAND HOURS THE NUMBER OF HOURS HE ESTIMATES MOST PEOPLE SPEND ON THEIR CAREER TO ADVISE PEOPLE ON HOW TO HAVE THE BEST MOST EFFECTIVE CAREER
PeterSinger_2013 BUT YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT ONE OF THE CAREERS THAT HE ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO CONSIDER IF THEY HAVE THE RIGHT ABILITIES AND CHARACTER IS TO GO INTO BANKING OR FINANCE
PeterSinger_2013 WHY
PeterSinger_2013 BECAUSE IF YOU EARN A LOT OF MONEY
PeterSinger_2013 YOU CAN GIVE AWAY A LOT OF MONEY
PeterSinger_2013 AND IF YOU 'RE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT CAREER YOU COULD GIVE ENOUGH TO AN AID ORGANIZATION SO THAT IT COULD EMPLOY LET 'S SAY FIVE
PeterSinger_2013 AID WORKERS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND EACH ONE OF THEM WOULD PROBABLY DO ABOUT AS MUCH GOOD AS YOU WOULD HAVE DONE
PeterSinger_2013 SO YOU CAN QUINTUPLE THE IMPACT BY LEADING THAT KIND OF CAREER
PeterSinger_2013 HERE 'S ONE YOUNG MAN WHO 'S TAKEN THIS ADVICE HIS NAME IS MATT WEIGER HE WAS A STUDENT AT PRINCETON IN PHILOSOPHY AND MATH ACTUALLY WON THE PRIZE FOR THE BEST UNDERGRADUATE PHILOSOPHY THESIS LAST YEAR WHEN HE GRADUATED
PeterSinger_2013 BUT HE 'S GONE INTO FINANCE IN NEW YORK HE 'S ALREADY EARNING ENOUGH SO THAT HE 'S GIVING A SIX FIGURE SUM TO EFFECTIVE CHARITIES AND STILL LEAVING HIMSELF WITH ENOUGH TO LIVE ON
PeterSinger_2013 MATT HAS ALSO HELPED ME TO SET UP AN ORGANIZATION THAT I 'M WORKING WITH THAT HAS THE NAME TAKEN FROM THE TITLE OF A BOOK I WROTE THE LIFE YOU CAN SAVE WHICH IS TRYING TO CHANGE OUR CULTURE SO THAT
PeterSinger_2013 MORE PEOPLE THINK THAT IF WE 'RE GOING TO LIVE AN ETHICAL LIFE IT 'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO FOLLOW THE THOU SHALT NOTS AND NOT CHEAT STEAL MAIM KILL BUT THAT IF WE HAVE ENOUGH WE HAVE TO SHARE SOME OF THAT WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE SO LITTLE
PeterSinger_2013 AND THE ORGANIZATION DRAWS TOGETHER PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT GENERATIONS LIKE HOLLY MORGAN WHO 'S AN UNDERGRADUATE WHO 'S PLEDGED TO GIVE TEN PERCENT OF THE LITTLE AMOUNT THAT SHE HAS AND ON THE RIGHT ADA WAN WHO HAS WORKED DIRECTLY FOR THE POOR BUT HAS NOW GONE TO YALE TO DO AN MBA TO HAVE MORE TO GIVE
PeterSinger_2013 MANY PEOPLE WILL THINK THOUGH THAT
PeterSinger_2013 CHARITIES AREN 'T REALLY ALL THAT EFFECTIVE SO LET 'S TALK ABOUT EFFECTIVENESS TOBY ORD IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND HE 'S CALCULATED THAT SOME CHARITIES ARE HUNDREDS OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHERS SO IT 'S VERY IMPORTANT TO FIND THE EFFECTIVE ONES
PeterSinger_2013 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDING A GUIDE DOG FOR A BLIND PERSON
PeterSinger_2013 SO YOU DO THE SUMS AND YOU GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU COULD PROVIDE ONE GUIDE DOG FOR ONE BLIND AMERICAN OR YOU COULD CURE BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE OF BLINDNESS
PeterSinger_2013 I THINK IT 'S CLEAR WHAT 'S THE BETTER THING TO DO BUT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR EFFECTIVE CHARITIES
PeterSinger_2013 THIS IS A GOOD WEBSITE TO GO TO
PeterSinger_2013 SO IT 'S VERY TOUGH IF YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS THELIFEYOUCANSAVE COM AND GIVING WHAT WE CAN BOTH HAVE A SOMEWHAT BROADER LIST
PeterSinger_2013 BUT YOU CAN FIND EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATIONS
PeterSinger_2013 AND NOT JUST IN THE AREA OF SAVING LIVES FROM THE POOR I 'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT THERE IS NOW ALSO A WEBSITE LOOKING AT EFFECTIVE
PeterSinger_2013 ANIMAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT 'S ANOTHER CAUSE THAT I 'VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT ALL MY LIFE THE IMMENSE AMOUNT OF SUFFERING THAT HUMANS INFLICT ON LITERALLY
PeterSinger_2013 TENS OF BILLIONS OF ANIMALS EVERY YEAR SO IF YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATIONS TO REDUCE THAT SUFFERING YOU CAN GO TO EFFECTIVE ANIMAL ACTIVISM AND SOME EFFECTIVE
PeterSinger_2013 MY FINAL QUESTION IS SOME PEOPLE WILL THINK IT 'S A BURDEN TO GIVE
PeterSinger_2013 I DON 'T REALLY BELIEVE IT IS I 'VE ENJOYED GIVING ALL OF MY LIFE SINCE I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT IT 'S BEEN SOMETHING FULFILLING TO ME
PeterSinger_2013 CHARLIE BRESLER SAID TO ME THAT HE 'S NOT AN ALTRUIST HE THINKS THAT THE LIFE HE 'S SAVING IS HIS OWN AND HOLLY MORGAN TOLD ME THAT SHE USED TO BATTLE DEPRESSION UNTIL SHE GOT INVOLVED WITH EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM AND NOW IS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE SHE KNOWS
PeterSinger_2013 I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS IS THAT BEING AN EFFECTIVE ALTRUIST HELPS TO OVERCOME WHAT I CALL THE SISYPHUS PROBLEM
PeterSinger_2013 CONDEMNED BY THE GODS TO PUSH A HUGE BOULDER UP TO THE TOP OF THE HILL JUST AS HE GETS THERE THE EFFORT BECOMES TOO MUCH THE BOULDER ESCAPES ROLLS ALL THE WAY DOWN THE HILL HE HAS TO TRUDGE BACK DOWN TO PUSH IT UP AGAIN AND THE SAME THING HAPPENS AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR ALL ETERNITY
PeterSinger_2013 DOES THAT REMIND YOU OF A CONSUMER LIFESTYLE WHERE YOU WORK HARD TO GET MONEY YOU SPEND THAT MONEY ON CONSUMER GOODS WHICH YOU HOPE YOU 'LL ENJOY USING
PeterSinger_2013 BUT THEN THE MONEY 'S GONE YOU HAVE TO WORK HARD TO GET MORE SPEND MORE AND TO MAINTAIN THE SAME LEVEL OF HAPPINESS IT 'S KIND OF A HEDONIC TREADMILL YOU NEVER GET OFF AND YOU NEVER REALLY FEEL SATISFIED
PeterSinger_2013 BECOMING AN EFFECTIVE ALTRUIST GIVES YOU THAT MEANING AND FULFILLMENT IT ENABLES YOU TO HAVE A SOLID BASIS FOR SELF ESTEEM ON WHICH YOU CAN FEEL YOUR LIFE
PeterSinger_2013 WAS REALLY WORTH LIVING I 'M GOING TO CONCLUDE
PeterSinger_2013 BY TELLING YOU ABOUT AN EMAIL THAT I RECEIVED WHILE I WAS WRITING THIS TALK JUST A MONTH OR SO AGO
PeterSinger_2013 THIS IS A PICTURE OF HIM SHOWING HIM RECOVERING FROM SURGERY WHY WAS HE RECOVERING FROM SURGERY THE EMAIL BEGAN LAST TUESDAY I ANONYMOUSLY DONATED MY RIGHT KIDNEY TO A STRANGER THAT STARTED A KIDNEY CHAIN WHICH ENABLED FOUR PEOPLE TO RECEIVE KIDNEYS
PeterSinger_2013 THERE 'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE EACH YEAR IN THE U S AND MORE IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHO DO THAT I WAS PLEASED TO READ IT CHRIS WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE 'D BEEN INFLUENCED BY MY WRITINGS IN WHAT HE DID WELL I HAVE TO ADMIT I 'M ALSO SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED BY THAT BECAUSE I STILL HAVE TWO KIDNEYS
PeterSinger_2013 BUT CHRIS WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE DIDN 'T THINK THAT WHAT HE 'D DONE WAS ALL THAT AMAZING BECAUSE HE CALCULATED THAT THE NUMBER OF LIFE YEARS THAT HE HAD ADDED TO PEOPLE THE EXTENSION OF LIFE
PeterSinger_2013 WAS ABOUT THE SAME THAT YOU COULD ACHIEVE IF YOU GAVE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE AGAINST MALARIA FOUNDATION
PeterSinger_2013 AND THAT DID MAKE ME FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER BECAUSE I HAVE GIVEN MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE AGAINST MALARIA FOUNDATION
PeterSinger_2013 AND TO VARIOUS OTHER EFFECTIVE CHARITIES SO IF YOU 'RE FEELING BAD BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE TWO KIDNEYS AS WELL THERE 'S A WAY FOR YOU TO GET OFF THE HOOK
