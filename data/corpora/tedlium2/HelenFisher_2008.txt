HelenFisher_2008@19.30:26.99 I AND MY COLLEAGUES ART ARON AND LUCY BROWN AND OTHERS HAVE PUT THIRTY SEVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE MADLY IN LOVE INTO A FUNCTIONAL MRI BRAIN SCANNER
HelenFisher_2008@36.53:46.50 AFTER TEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF MARRIAGE SO THIS IS THE SHORT STORY OF THAT RESEARCH IN THE JUNGLES OF GUATEMALA IN TIKAL STANDS A TEMPLE
HelenFisher_2008@47.49:55.83 IT WAS BUILT BY THE GRANDEST SUN KING OF THE GRANDEST CITY STATE OF THE GRANDEST CIVILIZATION OF THE AMERICAS THE
HelenFisher_2008@57.19:67.55 HIS NAME WAS JASAW CHAN K 'AWIIL HE STOOD OVER SIX FEET TALL HE LIVED INTO HIS EIGHTIES AND HE WAS BURIED BENEATH THIS MONUMENT IN SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY
HelenFisher_2008@68.61:76.04 AND MAYAN INSCRIPTIONS PROCLAIM THAT HE WAS DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH HIS WIFE SO HE BUILT A TEMPLE IN HER HONOR FACING HIS
HelenFisher_2008@76.54:84.04 AND EVERY SPRING AND AUTUMN EXACTLY AT THE EQUINOX THE SUN RISES BEHIND HIS TEMPLE AND PERFECTLY
HelenFisher_2008@84.80:93.78 BATHES HER TEMPLE WITH HIS SHADOW AND AS THE SUN SETS BEHIND HER TEMPLE IN THE AFTERNOON IT PERFECTLY BATHES HIS TEMPLE
HelenFisher_2008@103.06:110.65 AROUND THE WORLD PEOPLE LOVE THEY SING FOR LOVE THEY DANCE FOR LOVE THEY COMPOSE POEMS AND STORIES ABOUT LOVE
HelenFisher_2008@110.97:123.57 THEY TELL MYTHS AND LEGENDS ABOUT LOVE THEY PINE FOR LOVE THEY LIVE FOR LOVE THEY KILL FOR LOVE AND THEY DIE FOR LOVE AS WALT WHITMAN ONCE SAID HE SAID OH I WOULD STAKE ALL FOR YOU
HelenFisher_2008@132.51:146.09 BUT LOVE ISN'T ALWAYS A HAPPY EXPERIENCE IN ONE STUDY OF COLLEGE STUDENTS THEY ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT LOVE BUT THE TWO THAT STOOD OUT TO ME THE MOST WERE HAVE YOU EVER BEEN REJECTED BY SOMEBODY WHO YOU REALLY LOVED
HelenFisher_2008@146.74:159.91 AND THE SECOND QUESTION WAS HAVE YOU EVER DUMPED SOMEBODY WHO REALLY LOVED YOU AND ALMOST NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF BOTH MEN AND WOMEN SAID YES TO BOTH ALMOST NOBODY GETS OUT OF LOVE ALIVE
HelenFisher_2008@160.95:172.65 SO BEFORE I START TELLING YOU ABOUT THE BRAIN I WANT TO READ FOR YOU WHAT I THINK IS THE MOST POWERFUL LOVE POEM ON EARTH THERE'S OTHER LOVE POEMS THAT ARE OF COURSE JUST AS GOOD BUT I DON'T THINK THIS ONE CAN BE
HelenFisher_2008@173.80:178.68 IT WAS TOLD BY AN ANONYMOUS KWAKUTL INDIAN OF SOUTHERN ALASKA TO
HelenFisher_2008@182.16:185.74 HERE IT IS I'VE NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY IT BEFORE
HelenFisher_2008@187.12:198.53 FIRE RUNS THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE PAIN OF LOVING YOU PAIN RUNS THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FIRES OF MY LOVE FOR YOU PAIN LIKE A BOIL ABOUT TO BURST WITH MY LOVE FOR YOU
HelenFisher_2008@199.15:208.30 CONSUMED BY FIRE WITH MY LOVE FOR YOU I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME I AM THINKING OF YOUR LOVE FOR ME I AM TORN BY YOUR LOVE FOR ME
HelenFisher_2008@208.76:222.93 PAIN AND MORE PAIN WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH MY LOVE I AM TOLD YOU WILL GO FROM HERE I AM TOLD YOU WILL LEAVE ME HERE MY BODY IS NUMB WITH GRIEF REMEMBER WHAT I SAID MY LOVE GOODBYE MY LOVE GOODBYE
HelenFisher_2008@231.27:242.08 HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED IN ALL THE MILLIONS OF YEARS OF HUMAN EVOLUTION HOW MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ARE DANCING WITH ELATION AT THIS VERY MINUTE
HelenFisher_2008@250.39:259.08 AND STUDY THIS MADNESS OUR FIRST STUDY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE HAPPILY IN LOVE HAS BEEN WIDELY PUBLICIZED SO I'M ONLY GOING TO SAY A VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT
HelenFisher_2008@259.81:273.92 WE FOUND ACTIVITY IN A TINY LITTLE FACTORY NEAR THE BASE OF THE BRAIN CALLED THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA WE FOUND ACTIVITY IN SOME CELLS CALLED THE A TEN CELLS CELLS THAT ACTUALLY MAKE DOPAMINE A NATURAL STIMULANT AND SPRAY IT TO MANY BRAIN REGIONS
HelenFisher_2008@274.33:285.51 INDEED THIS PART THE VTA IS PART OF THE BRAIN 'S REWARD SYSTEM IT'S WAY BELOW YOUR COGNITIVE THINKING PROCESS IT'S BELOW YOUR EMOTIONS IT'S PART OF WHAT WE CALL THE REPTILIAN CORE OF THE BRAIN
HelenFisher_2008@286.28:297.19 WITH WANTING WITH MOTIVATION WITH FOCUS AND WITH CRAVING IN FACT THE SAME BRAIN REGION WHERE WE FOUND ACTIVITY BECOMES ACTIVE ALSO WHEN YOU FEEL THE RUSH OF COCAINE
HelenFisher_2008@298.05:306.33 BUT ROMANTIC LOVE IS MUCH MORE THAN A COCAINE HIGH AT LEAST YOU COME DOWN FROM COCAINE ROMANTIC LOVE IS AN OBSESSION IT POSSESSES YOU
HelenFisher_2008@306.68:319.98 YOU LOSE YOUR SENSE OF SELF YOU CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT ANOTHER HUMAN BEING SOMEBODY IS CAMPING IN YOUR HEAD AS AN EIGHTH CENTURY JAPANESE POET SAID MY LONGING HAD NO TIME WHEN IT CEASES
HelenFisher_2008@320.93:331.12 WILD IS LOVE AND THE OBSESSION CAN GET WORSE WHEN YOU'VE BEEN REJECTED SO RIGHT NOW LUCY BROWN AND I THE NEUROSCIENTIST ON OUR PROJECT
HelenFisher_2008@331.38:341.29 ARE LOOKING AT THE DATA OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE PUT INTO THE MACHINE AFTER THEY HAD JUST BEEN DUMPED IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT ACTUALLY PUTTING THESE PEOPLE IN THE MACHINE BECAUSE THEY WERE IN SUCH BAD SHAPE
HelenFisher_2008@345.54:354.55 SO ANYWAY WE FOUND ACTIVITY IN THREE BRAIN REGIONS WE FOUND ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN REGION IN EXACTLY THE SAME BRAIN REGION ASSOCIATED WITH INTENSE ROMANTIC LOVE
HelenFisher_2008@355.14:366.97 WHAT A BAD DEAL YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'VE BEEN DUMPED THE ONE THING YOU LOVE TO DO IS JUST FORGET ABOUT THIS HUMAN BEING AND THEN GO ON WITH YOUR LIFE BUT NO YOU JUST LOVE THEM HARDER AS THE POET
HelenFisher_2008@378.20:392.28 THAT BRAIN SYSTEM THE REWARD SYSTEM FOR WANTING FOR MOTIVATION FOR CRAVING FOR FOCUS BECOMES MORE ACTIVE WHEN YOU CAN'T GET WHAT YOU WANT IN THIS CASE LIFE 'S GREATEST PRIZE AN APPROPRIATE MATING PARTNER
HelenFisher_2008@392.67:404.58 WE FOUND ACTIVITY IN OTHER BRAIN REGIONS ALSO IN A BRAIN REGION ASSOCIATED WITH CALCULATING GAINS AND LOSSES YOU KNOW YOU'RE LYING THERE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PICTURE AND YOU'RE IN THIS MACHINE AND YOU'RE CALCULATING
HelenFisher_2008@404.86:414.20 YOU KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG HOW YOU KNOW WHAT HAVE I LOST AS A MATTER OF FACT LUCY AND I HAVE A LITTLE JOKE ABOUT THIS IT COMES FROM A DAVID MAMET
HelenFisher_2008@415.77:425.40 TWO CON ARTISTS IN THE PLAY AND THE WOMAN IS CONNING THE MAN AND THE MAN LOOKS AT THE WOMAN AND SAYS OH YOU'RE A BAD PONY I'M NOT GOING TO BET
HelenFisher_2008@426.58:434.46 AND INDEED IT'S THIS PART OF THE BRAIN THE CORE OF THE NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS THAT IS BECOMING ACTIVE AS YOU'RE MEASURING YOUR GAINS AND LOSSES
HelenFisher_2008@434.76:449.07 IT'S ALSO THE BRAIN REGION THAT BECOMES ACTIVE WHEN YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE ENORMOUS RISKS FOR HUGE GAINS AND HUGE LOSSES LAST BUT NOT LEAST WE FOUND ACTIVITY IN A BRAIN REGION ASSOCIATED WITH DEEP ATTACHMENT TO ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL
HelenFisher_2008@450.07:458.02 NO WONDER PEOPLE SUFFER AROUND THE WORLD AND WE HAVE SO MANY CRIMES OF PASSION WHEN YOU'VE BEEN REJECTED IN LOVE
HelenFisher_2008@458.34:467.95 NOT ONLY ARE YOU ENGULFED WITH FEELINGS OF ROMANTIC LOVE BUT YOU'RE FEELING DEEP ATTACHMENT TO THIS INDIVIDUAL MOREOVER THIS BRAIN CIRCUIT FOR REWARD IS WORKING
HelenFisher_2008@468.27:477.98 AND YOU'RE FEELING INTENSE ENERGY INTENSE FOCUS INTENSE MOTIVATION AND THE WILLINGNESS TO RISK IT ALL TO WIN LIFE 'S GREATEST PRIZE
HelenFisher_2008@479.89:493.46 SO WHAT HAVE I LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIMENT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TELL THE WORLD FOREMOST I HAVE COME TO THINK THAT ROMANTIC LOVE IS A DRIVE A BASIC MATING DRIVE NOT THE SEX DRIVE THE SEX DRIVE GETS YOU OUT THERE LOOKING FOR A WHOLE RANGE OF PARTNERS
HelenFisher_2008@503.48:516.52 I THINK OF ALL THE POETRY THAT I'VE READ ABOUT ROMANTIC LOVE WHAT SUMS IT UP BEST IS SOMETHING THAT IS SAID BY PLATO OVER TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO HE SAID THE GOD OF LOVE LIVES IN A STATE OF NEED
HelenFisher_2008@517.22:526.52 IT IS A NEED IT IS AN URGE IT IS A HOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCE LIKE HUNGER AND THIRST IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO STAMP OUT
HelenFisher_2008@527.47:536.11 I'VE ALSO COME TO BELIEVE THAT ROMANTIC LOVE IS AN ADDICTION A PERFECTLY WONDERFUL ADDICTION WHEN IT'S GOING WELL AND A PERFECTLY HORRIBLE ADDICTION WHEN IT'S GOING POORLY
HelenFisher_2008@536.43:549.68 AND INDEED IT HAS ALL OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ADDICTION YOU FOCUS ON THE PERSON YOU OBSESSIVELY THINK ABOUT THEM YOU CRAVE THEM YOU DISTORT REALITY YOUR WILLINGNESS TO TAKE ENORMOUS RISKS TO WIN THIS PERSON AND IT'S GOT THE THREE MAIN
HelenFisher_2008@559.84:567.84 TERRIBLE LOVE AFFAIR IT'S BEEN ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS SHE'S BEGINNING TO FEEL BETTER AND SHE WAS DRIVING ALONG IN HER CAR THE OTHER DAY AND SUDDENLY SHE HEARD A SONG ON THE CAR RADIO
HelenFisher_2008@568.11:575.79 THAT REMINDED HER OF THIS MAN AND SHE NOT ONLY DID THE INSTANT CRAVING COME BACK BUT SHE HAD TO PULL OVER FROM THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND
HelenFisher_2008@576.78:583.58 SO ONE THING I WOULD LIKE THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AND THE LEGAL COMMUNITY AND EVEN THE COLLEGE COMMUNITY TO SEE IF THEY CAN UNDERSTAND
HelenFisher_2008@583.86:591.98 THAT INDEED ROMANTIC LOVE IS ONE OF THE MOST ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCES ON EARTH I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TELL THE WORLD THAT ANIMALS LOVE
HelenFisher_2008@592.76:604.18 NOT AN ANIMAL ON THIS PLANET THAT WILL COPULATE WITH ANYTHING THAT COMES ALONG TOO OLD TOO YOUNG TOO SCRUFFY TOO STUPID AND THEY WON 'T DO IT UNLESS YOU'RE STUCK IN A LABORATORY CAGE
HelenFisher_2008@605.09:613.98 YOU KNOW IF YOU SPEND YOUR ENTIRE LIFE IN A LITTLE BOX YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE AS PICKY ABOUT WHO YOU HAVE SEX WITH BUT I'VE LOOKED IN A HUNDRED SPECIES
HelenFisher_2008@614.41:624.35 AND EVERYWHERE IN THE WILD ANIMALS HAVE FAVORITES AS A MATTER OF FACT ETHOLOGISTS KNOW THIS THERE'S OVER EIGHT WORDS FOR WHAT THEY CALL ANIMAL FAVORITISM SELECTIVE
HelenFisher_2008@626.24:637.89 CHOICE FEMALE CHOICE SEXUAL CHOICE AND INDEED THERE ARE THREE ACADEMIC ARTICLES IN WHICH THEY'VE LOOKED AT THIS ATTRACTION WHICH MAY ONLY LAST FOR A SECOND BUT IT'S A DEFINITE ATTRACTION
HelenFisher_2008@638.33:644.83 AND EITHER THIS SAME BRAIN REGION THIS REWARD SYSTEM OR THE CHEMICALS OF THAT REWARD SYSTEM ARE INVOLVED
HelenFisher_2008@645.03:654.93 IN FACT I THINK ANIMAL ATTRACTION CAN BE INSTANT YOU CAN SEE AN ELEPHANT INSTANTLY GO FOR ANOTHER ELEPHANT AND I THINK THAT THIS IS REALLY THE ORIGINS OF WHAT YOU AND I CALL LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
HelenFisher_2008@656.93:664.66 PEOPLE HAVE OFTEN ASKED ME WHETHER WHAT I KNOW ABOUT LOVE HAS SPOILED IT FOR ME AND I JUST SIMPLY SAY HARDLY
HelenFisher_2008@665.29:671.76 YOU CAN KNOW EVERY SINGLE INGREDIENT IN A PIECE OF CHOCOLATE CAKE AND THEN WHEN YOU SIT DOWN AND EAT THAT CAKE YOU CAN STILL FEEL THAT
HelenFisher_2008@673.02:681.20 AND CERTAINLY I MAKE ALL THE SAME MISTAKES THAT EVERYBODY ELSE DOES TOO BUT IT'S REALLY DEEPENED MY UNDERSTANDING AND
HelenFisher_2008@692.76:702.87 IN FACT SOMETIMES I FEEL A LITTLE SORRY FOR THE CHICKEN ON MY DINNER PLATE WHEN I THINK OF HOW INTENSE THIS BRAIN SYSTEM IS OUR NEWEST EXPERIMENT
HelenFisher_2008@705.42:717.36 BEEN HATCHED BY MY COLLEAGUE ART ARON PUTTING PEOPLE WHO ARE REPORTING THAT THEY ARE STILL IN LOVE IN A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP INTO THE FUNCTIONAL MRI WE'VE PUT FIVE PEOPLE IN SO FAR
HelenFisher_2008@717.91:728.02 AND INDEED WE FOUND EXACTLY THE SAME THING THEY'RE NOT LYING THE BRAIN AREAS ASSOCIATED WITH INTENSE ROMANTIC LOVE
HelenFisher_2008@728.41:736.01 STILL BECOME ACTIVE TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER THERE ARE STILL MANY QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED AND
HelenFisher_2008@736.72:745.95 ASKED ABOUT ROMANTIC LOVE THE QUESTION THAT I'M WORKING ON RIGHT THIS MINUTE AND I'M ONLY GOING TO SAY IT FOR A SECOND AND THEN END IS WHY DO YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH ONE PERSON RATHER THAN ANOTHER
HelenFisher_2008@746.96:753.84 I NEVER WOULD HAVE EVEN THOUGHT TO THINK OF THIS BUT MATCH COM THE INTERNET DATING SITE CAME TO ME THREE YEARS AGO AND ASKED ME THAT QUESTION
HelenFisher_2008@754.23:761.97 AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BRAIN WHEN YOU DO BECOME IN LOVE BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH ONE PERSON RATHER THAN ANOTHER
HelenFisher_2008@762.46:769.89 AND SO I'VE SPENT THE LAST THREE YEARS ON THIS AND THERE'S MANY REASONS THAT YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH ONE PERSON RATHER THAN ANOTHER THAT PSYCHOLOGISTS CAN TELL YOU
HelenFisher_2008@781.45:789.29 AND THAT'S ABOUT IT THAT'S ALL THEY KNOW NO THEY'VE NEVER FOUND THE WAY TWO PERSONALITIES FIT TOGETHER TO MAKE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP
HelenFisher_2008@789.61:799.11 SO IT BEGAN TO OCCUR TO ME THAT MAYBE YOUR BIOLOGY PULLS YOU TOWARDS SOME PEOPLE RATHER THAN ANOTHER AND I HAVE CONCOCTED A QUESTIONNAIRE
HelenFisher_2008@799.32:810.53 TO SEE TO WHAT DEGREE YOU EXPRESS DOPAMINE SEROTONIN ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTERONE I THINK WE'VE EVOLVED FOUR VERY BROAD PERSONALITY TYPES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RATIOS OF THESE
HelenFisher_2008@811.32:819.39 CHEMICALS IN THE BRAIN AND ON THIS DATING SITE THAT I HAVE CREATED CALLED CHEMISTRY COM I ASK YOU FIRST
HelenFisher_2008@819.70:827.97 A SERIES OF QUESTIONS TO SEE TO WHAT DEGREE YOU EXPRESS THESE CHEMICALS AND I'M WATCHING WHO CHOOSES WHO TO LOVE AND
HelenFisher_2008@828.40:838.78 THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN THE QUESTIONNAIRE IN AMERICA ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN IT IN THIRTY THREE OTHER COUNTRIES I'M PUTTING THE DATA TOGETHER NOW AND AT SOME POINT
HelenFisher_2008@839.50:847.55 WILL ALWAYS BE MAGIC TO LOVE BUT I THINK I WILL COME CLOSER TO UNDERSTANDING WHY IT IS YOU CAN WALK INTO A ROOM AND EVERYBODY
HelenFisher_2008@847.80:854.48 IS FROM YOUR BACKGROUND YOUR SAME GENERAL LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE YOUR SAME GENERAL LEVEL OF GOOD LOOKS AND YOU DON'T FEEL PULLED TOWARDS ALL OF THEM
HelenFisher_2008@854.73:866.52 I THINK THERE'S BIOLOGY TO THAT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO END UP IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS TO UNDERSTAND ALL KINDS OF BRAIN MECHANISMS THAT PULL US TO ONE PERSON RATHER THAN ANOTHER SO I WILL CLOSE WITH THIS
HelenFisher_2008@867.57:875.59 THESE ARE MY OLDER PEOPLE FAULKNER ONCE SAID THE PAST IS NOT DEAD IT'S NOT EVEN THE PAST
HelenFisher_2008@875.97:882.28 INDEED WE CARRY A LOT OF LUGGAGE FROM OUR YESTERYEAR IN THE HUMAN BRAIN AND SO THERE'S ONE THING THAT MAKES
HelenFisher_2008@885.22:891.53 MY UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN NATURE AND THIS REMINDS ME OF IT THESE ARE TWO WOMEN
HelenFisher_2008@891.94:898.75 WOMEN TEND TO GET INTIMACY DIFFERENTLY THAN MEN DO WOMEN GET INTIMACY FROM FACE TO FACE TALKING WE SWIVEL TOWARDS EACH OTHER
HelenFisher_2008@899.41:911.36 WE DO WHAT WE CALL THE ANCHORING GAZE AND WE TALK THIS IS INTIMACY TO WOMEN I THINK IT COMES FROM MILLIONS OF YEARS OF HOLDING THAT BABY IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE CAJOLING IT REPRIMANDING IT EDUCATING IT WITH WORDS
HelenFisher_2008@912.30:918.98 MEN TEND TO GET INTIMACY FROM SIDE BY SIDE DOING AS SOON AS ONE GUY LOOKS UP THE OTHER GUY WILL LOOK AWAY
HelenFisher_2008@920.92:930.04 I THINK IT COMES FROM MILLIONS OF YEARS OF STANDING BEHIND THAT SITTING BEHIND THE BUSH LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD TRYING TO HIT THAT BUFFALO ON THE HEAD WITH A ROCK
HelenFisher_2008@930.53:938.34 I THINK FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS MEN FACED THEIR ENEMIES THEY SAT SIDE BY SIDE WITH FRIENDS SO MY FINAL STATEMENT IS
HelenFisher_2008@938.87:946.30 LOVE IS IN US IT'S DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN THE BRAIN OUR CHALLENGE IS TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER THANK YOU
