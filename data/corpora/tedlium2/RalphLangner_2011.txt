RalphLangner_2011 IDEA BEHIND THE STUXNET COMPUTER WORM IS ACTUALLY QUITE SIMPLE
RalphLangner_2011 NOW IF WE MANAGE TO COMPROMISE THESE SYSTEMS THAT CONTROL DRIVE SPEEDS
RalphLangner_2011 PLACE A GOOD WINDOWS VIRUS ON A NOTEBOOK THAT IS USED BY A MAINTENANCE ENGINEER TO CONFIGURE
RalphLangner_2011 I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW WE FOUND THAT OUT WHEN WE STARTED OUR RESEARCH ON STUXNET SIX MONTHS AGO IT WAS COMPLETELY UNKNOWN WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS THING WAS
RalphLangner_2011 THE ONLY THING THAT WAS KNOWN IS IT 'S VERY VERY COMPLEX ON THE WINDOWS PART THE DROPPER PART USED MULTIPLE ZERO DAY VULNERABILITIES
RalphLangner_2011 AND IT SEEMED TO WANT TO DO SOMETHING WITH THESE GRAY BOXES THESE REAL TIME CONTROL SYSTEMS SO THAT GOT OUR ATTENTION AND WE STARTED A LAB PROJECT WHERE WE INFECTED OUR ENVIRONMENT WITH STUXNET AND CHECKED THIS THING OUT
RalphLangner_2011 PROGRAM CODE THAT IT 'S TRYING TO INFECT IS ACTUALLY RUNNING ON THAT TARGET AND IF NOT
RalphLangner_2011 STUXNET DOES NOTHING SO THAT REALLY GOT MY ATTENTION AND WE STARTED TO WORK ON THIS NEARLY AROUND THE CLOCK BECAUSE I THOUGHT WELL WE DON 'T KNOW WHAT THE TARGET IS IT COULD BE LET 'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE A U S POWER PLANT OR A CHEMICAL PLANT IN GERMANY SO WE BETTER FIND OUT WHAT THE TARGET IS SOON
RalphLangner_2011 SO WE EXTRACTED AND DECOMPILED THE ATTACK CODE AND WE DISCOVERED THAT IT 'S STRUCTURED IN TWO DIGITAL BOMBS A SMALLER ONE AND A BIGGER ONE
RalphLangner_2011 AND WE ALSO SAW THAT THEY ARE VERY PROFESSIONALLY ENGINEERED BY PEOPLE WHO OBVIOUSLY HAD ALL INSIDER INFORMATION THEY KNEW ALL THE BITS AND BITES THAT THEY HAD TO ATTACK
RalphLangner_2011 THEY PROBABLY EVEN KNOW THE SHOE SIZE OF THE OPERATOR SO THEY KNOW EVERYTHING AND IF YOU HAVE HEARD THAT THE DROPPER OF STUXNET IS COMPLEX AND HIGH TECH LET ME TELL YOU THIS THE PAYLOAD IS ROCKET SCIENCE IT 'S WAY ABOVE EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE
RalphLangner_2011 IN ORDER TO GET TARGET THEORIES WE REMEMBER THAT IT 'S DEFINITELY HARDCORE SABOTAGE
RalphLangner_2011 IT MUST BE A HIGH VALUE TARGET AND IT IS MOST LIKELY LOCATED IN IRAN BECAUSE THAT 'S WHERE MOST OF THE INFECTIONS HAD BEEN REPORTED
RalphLangner_2011 NOW YOU DON 'T FIND SEVERAL THOUSAND TARGETS IN THAT AREA IT BASICALLY BOILS DOWN TO THE BUSHEHR NUCLEAR POWER PLANT AND TO THE NATANZ FUEL ENRICHMENT PLANT SO I TOLD MY ASSISTANT GET ME A LIST OF ALL CENTRIFUGE AND POWER PLANT EXPERTS FROM OUR CLIENT BASE
RalphLangner_2011 AND I PHONED THEM UP AND PICKED THEIR BRAIN IN AN EFFORT TO MATCH
RalphLangner_2011 THEIR EXPERTISE WITH WHAT WE FOUND IN CODE AND DATA
RalphLangner_2011 AND THAT WORKED PRETTY WELL SO WE WERE ABLE TO ASSOCIATE THE SMALL DIGITAL WARHEAD WITH THE ROTOR CONTROL THE ROTOR IS THAT MOVING PART WITHIN THE CENTRIFUGE THAT BLACK OBJECT THAT YOU SEE
RalphLangner_2011 AND IF YOU MANIPULATE THE SPEED OF THIS ROTOR YOU ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO CRACK THE ROTOR AND EVENTUALLY EVEN HAVE THE CENTRIFUGE EXPLODE
RalphLangner_2011 WHAT WE ALSO SAW IS THAT THE GOAL OF THE ATTACK WAS REALLY TO DO IT SLOWLY AND CREEPY OBVIOUSLY IN AN EFFORT TO DRIVE MAINTENANCE ENGINEERS CRAZY THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FIGURE THIS OUT QUICKLY
RalphLangner_2011 THE BIG DIGITAL WARHEAD WE HAD A SHOT AT THIS BY LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT DATA AND DATA STRUCTURES SO FOR EXAMPLE THE NUMBER ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR REALLY STANDS OUT IN THAT CODE YOU CAN 'T OVERLOOK IT
RalphLangner_2011 I STARTED TO RESEARCH SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE ON HOW THESE CENTRIFUGES ARE ACTUALLY BUILT IN NATANZ AND FOUND THEY ARE STRUCTURED IN WHAT IS CALLED A CASCADE AND EACH CASCADE HOLDS ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR CENTRIFUGES SO THAT MADE SENSE THAT WAS A MATCH AND IT EVEN GOT BETTER
RalphLangner_2011 THESE CENTRIFUGES IN IRAN ARE SUBDIVIDED INTO FIFTEEN WHAT IS CALLED STAGES
RalphLangner_2011 AND GUESS WHAT WE FOUND IN THE ATTACK CODE AN ALMOST IDENTICAL STRUCTURE SO AGAIN THAT WAS A REAL GOOD MATCH
RalphLangner_2011 ANYWAY SO WE FIGURED OUT THAT BOTH DIGITAL WARHEADS WERE ACTUALLY AIMING AT ONE AND THE SAME TARGET BUT FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES
RalphLangner_2011 THE SMALL WARHEAD IS TAKING ONE CASCADE AND SPINNING UP THE ROTORS AND SLOWING THEM DOWN AND THE BIG WARHEAD IS TALKING TO SIX CASCADES AND MANIPULATING VALVES
RalphLangner_2011 SO IN ALL WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY DETERMINED WHAT THE TARGET IS IT IS NATANZ AND IT IS ONLY NATANZ SO WE DON 'T HAVE TO WORRY THAT OTHER TARGETS MIGHT BE HIT BY STUXNET HERE 'S SOME VERY COOL STUFF THAT WE SAW
RalphLangner_2011 NOW WHAT THIS THING DOES IS IT INTERCEPTS THE INPUT VALUES FROM SENSORS SO FOR EXAMPLE FROM PRESSURE SENSORS AND VIBRATION SENSORS
RalphLangner_2011 AND IT PROVIDES LEGITIMATE PROGRAM CODE WHICH IS STILL RUNNING DURING THE ATTACK WITH FAKE INPUT DATA
RalphLangner_2011 AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS FAKE INPUT DATA IS ACTUALLY PRERECORDED BY STUXNET SO IT 'S JUST LIKE FROM THE HOLLYWOOD MOVIES WHERE DURING THE HEIST THE OBSERVATION CAMERA IS FED WITH PRERECORDED VIDEO
RalphLangner_2011 THAT 'S COOL
RalphLangner_2011 THE
RalphLangner_2011 IDEA HERE IS OBVIOUSLY NOT ONLY TO FOOL THE OPERATORS IN THE CONTROL ROOM IT ACTUALLY IS MUCH MORE DANGEROUS AND AGGRESSIVE THE IDEA IS TO CIRCUMVENT A DIGITAL SAFETY SYSTEM
RalphLangner_2011 OBVIOUSLY THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY A HUMAN OPERATOR SO THIS IS WHERE WE NEED DIGITAL SAFETY SYSTEMS AND WHEN THEY ARE COMPROMISED THEN REAL BAD THINGS CAN HAPPEN YOUR PLANT CAN BLOW UP AND NEITHER YOUR OPERATORS NOR YOUR SAFETY SYSTEM WILL NOTICE IT THAT 'S SCARY BUT IT GETS WORSE
RalphLangner_2011 AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT WHAT I 'M GOING TO SAY
RalphLangner_2011 THINK ABOUT THIS THIS ATTACK
RalphLangner_2011 IS GENERIC
RalphLangner_2011 IT IS GENERIC
RalphLangner_2011 AND YOU DON 'T HAVE AS AN ATTACKER YOU DON 'T HAVE TO DELIVER THIS PAYLOAD BY A USB STICK AS WE SAW IT IN THE CASE OF STUXNET YOU COULD ALSO USE CONVENTIONAL WORM TECHNOLOGY FOR SPREADING JUST SPREAD IT AS WIDE AS POSSIBLE AND IF YOU DO THAT WHAT YOU END UP WITH IS
RalphLangner_2011 THAT 'S THE CONSEQUENCE THAT WE HAVE TO FACE
RalphLangner_2011 SO UNFORTUNATELY
RalphLangner_2011 THE BIGGEST NUMBER OF TARGETS FOR SUCH ATTACKS ARE NOT IN THE MIDDLE EAST
RalphLangner_2011 SO ALL OF THE GREEN AREAS THESE ARE YOUR TARGET RICH ENVIRONMENTS
RalphLangner_2011 WE HAVE TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES AND WE BETTER START TO PREPARE RIGHT NOW THANKS
RalphLangner_2011 THERE IS ONLY ONE AND THAT 'S THE UNITED STATES
RalphLangner_2011 FORTUNATELY FORTUNATELY
RalphLangner_2011 BECAUSE OTHERWISE OUR PROBLEMS WOULD EVEN BE BIGGER
