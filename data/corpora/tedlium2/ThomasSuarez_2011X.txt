ThomasSuarez_2011X@70.53:87.7 A LOT OF KIDS THESE DAYS LIKE TO PLAY GAMES BUT NOW THEY WANT TO MAKE THEM AND IT 'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE NOT MANY KIDS KNOW WHERE TO GO TO FIND OUT HOW TO MAKE A PROGRAM I MEAN FOR SOCCER YOU COULD GO TO A SOCCER TEAM FOR VIOLIN YOU COULD GET LESSONS FOR A VIOLIN
ThomasSuarez_2011X@87.7:89.55 BUT WHAT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AN APP
ThomasSuarez_2011X@113.99:127.43 AND THEN APPLE RELEASED THE IPHONE AND WITH IT THE IPHONE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT AND THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT IS A SUITE OF TOOLS FOR CREATING AND PROGRAMMING AN IPHONE APP
ThomasSuarez_2011X@127.43:135.97 THIS OPENED UP A WHOLE NEW WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES FOR ME AND AFTER PLAYING WITH THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT A LITTLE BIT I MADE A COUPLE
ThomasSuarez_2011X@144.84:154.37 I PERSUADED MY PARENTS TO PAY THE NINETY NINE DOLLAR FEE TO BE ABLE TO PUT MY APPS ON THE APP STORE THEY AGREED AND NOW I HAVE APPS ON THE APP STORE
ThomasSuarez_2011X@181.61:186.1 THIS IS SO I CAN SHARE MY EXPERIENCES WITH OTHERS
ThomasSuarez_2011X@222.01:229.83 THESE DAYS STUDENTS USUALLY KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN TEACHERS WITH THE TECHNOLOGY
