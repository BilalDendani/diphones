DaveMeslin_2010X OFTEN DO WE HEAR THAT PEOPLE JUST DON 'T CARE
DaveMeslin_2010X HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU BEEN TOLD THAT REAL SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE ISN 'T POSSIBLE BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ARE TOO SELFISH TOO STUPID OR TOO LAZY TO TRY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR COMMUNITY
DaveMeslin_2010X I PROPOSE TO YOU TODAY THAT APATHY AS WE THINK WE KNOW IT DOESN 'T ACTUALLY EXIST BUT RATHER THAT PEOPLE DO CARE BUT THAT WE LIVE IN A WORLD THAT
DaveMeslin_2010X ACTIVELY DISCOURAGES ENGAGEMENT BY CONSTANTLY PUTTING OBSTACLES AND BARRIERS IN OUR WAY AND I 'LL GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT I MEAN LET 'S START WITH CITY HALL YOU EVER SEE ONE OF THESE BEFORE
DaveMeslin_2010X THIS IS A NEWSPAPER AD IT 'S A NOTICE OF A ZONING APPLICATION CHANGE FOR A NEW OFFICE BUILDING SO THE NEIGHBORHOOD KNOWS WHAT 'S HAPPENING AS YOU CAN SEE IT 'S IMPOSSIBLE TO READ YOU NEED TO GET HALFWAY DOWN TO EVEN FIND OUT WHICH ADDRESS THEY 'RE TALKING ABOUT AND THEN FARTHER DOWN IN TINY TEN POINT FONT TO FIND OUT HOW TO ACTUALLY GET INVOLVED
DaveMeslin_2010X IMAGINE IF THE PRIVATE SECTOR ADVERTISED IN THE SAME WAY IF NIKE WANTED TO SELL A PAIR OF SHOES
DaveMeslin_2010X AND PUT AN AD IN THE PAPER LIKE THAT
DaveMeslin_2010X YOU 'LL NEVER SEE AN AD LIKE THAT BECAUSE NIKE ACTUALLY WANTS YOU TO BUY THEIR SHOES WHEREAS THE CITY OF TORONTO CLEARLY DOESN 'T WANT YOU INVOLVED WITH THE PLANNING PROCESS OTHERWISE THEIR ADS WOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS WITH ALL THE INFORMATION BASICALLY LAID OUT CLEARLY AS LONG AS THE CITY 'S PUTTING OUT NOTICES LIKE THIS TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE ENGAGED THEN OF COURSE PEOPLE AREN 'T GOING TO BE ENGAGED
DaveMeslin_2010X BUT THAT 'S NOT APATHY THAT 'S INTENTIONAL EXCLUSION
DaveMeslin_2010X WHICH WE MISTREAT OUR PUBLIC SPACES IS A HUGE OBSTACLE TOWARDS ANY TYPE OF PROGRESSIVE POLITICAL CHANGE BECAUSE WE 'VE ESSENTIALLY PUT A PRICE TAG ON FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
DaveMeslin_2010X WHOEVER HAS THE MOST MONEY GETS THE LOUDEST VOICE DOMINATING THE VISUAL AND MENTAL ENVIRONMENT THE PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL IS THAT THERE ARE SOME AMAZING MESSAGES THAT NEED TO BE SAID THAT AREN 'T PROFITABLE TO SAY
DaveMeslin_2010X SO YOU 'RE NEVER GOING TO SEE THEM ON A BILLBOARD
DaveMeslin_2010X THE MEDIA PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN DEVELOPING OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH
DaveMeslin_2010X POLITICAL CHANGE MAINLY BY IGNORING POLITICS AND FOCUSING ON CELEBRITIES AND SCANDALS BUT EVEN WHEN THEY DO TALK ABOUT IMPORTANT POLITICAL ISSUES THEY DO IT IN A WAY THAT I FEEL DISCOURAGES ENGAGEMENT AND I 'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THE NOW MAGAZINE FROM LAST WEEK PROGRESSIVE DOWNTOWN WEEKLY IN TORONTO THIS IS THE COVER STORY
DaveMeslin_2010X IT 'S AN ARTICLE ABOUT A THEATER PERFORMANCE AND IT STARTS WITH BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE IT IS IN CASE YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GO AND SEE IT AFTER YOU 'VE READ THE ARTICLE WHERE THE TIME THE WEBSITE SAME WITH THIS IT 'S A MOVIE REVIEW
DaveMeslin_2010X A RESTAURANT YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO JUST READ ABOUT IT MAYBE YOU WANT TO GO TO THE RESTAURANT SO THEY TELL YOU WHERE IT IS WHAT THE PRICES ARE
DaveMeslin_2010X HERE 'S ANOTHER GOOD ARTICLE ABOUT A NEW CAMPAIGN OPPOSING PRIVATIZATION OF TRANSIT WITHOUT ANY CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE CAMPAIGN THE MESSAGE SEEMS TO BE THAT THE READERS ARE MOST LIKELY TO WANT TO EAT MAYBE READ A BOOK MAYBE SEE A MOVIE BUT NOT BE ENGAGED IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND YOU MIGHT THINK THIS IS A SMALL THING BUT I THINK IT 'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SETS A TONE
DaveMeslin_2010X AND IT REINFORCES THE DANGEROUS IDEA THAT POLITICS IS A SPECTATOR SPORT
DaveMeslin_2010X HEROES HOW DO WE VIEW LEADERSHIP LOOK AT THESE TEN MOVIES WHAT DO THEY HAVE IN COMMON ANYONE
DaveMeslin_2010X THEY ALL HAVE HEROES WHO WERE CHOSEN SOMEONE CAME UP TO THEM AND SAID YOU 'RE THE CHOSEN ONE THERE 'S A PROPHESY YOU HAVE TO SAVE THE WORLD AND THEN SOMEONE GOES OFF AND SAVES THE WORLD BECAUSE THEY 'VE BEEN TOLD TO WITH A FEW PEOPLE TAGGING ALONG
DaveMeslin_2010X THIS HELPS ME UNDERSTAND WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE SEEING THEMSELVES AS LEADERS BECAUSE IT SENDS ALL THE WRONG MESSAGES ABOUT WHAT LEADERSHIP IS ABOUT
DaveMeslin_2010X A HEROIC EFFORT IS A COLLECTIVE EFFORT NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IT 'S IMPERFECT IT 'S NOT VERY GLAMOROUS AND IT DOESN 'T SUDDENLY START AND SUDDENLY END IT 'S AN ONGOING PROCESS YOUR WHOLE LIFE BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT 'S VOLUNTARY
DaveMeslin_2010X THAT HEROISM STARTS WHEN SOMEONE SCRATCHES A MARK ON YOUR FOREHEAD OR SOMEONE TELLS YOU THAT YOU 'RE PART OF A PROPHECY THEY 'RE MISSING THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC OF LEADERSHIP WHICH IS THAT IT COMES FROM WITHIN IT 'S ABOUT FOLLOWING YOUR OWN DREAMS UNINVITED
DaveMeslin_2010X UNINVITED AND THEN WORKING WITH OTHERS TO MAKE THOSE DREAMS COME TRUE
DaveMeslin_2010X POLITICAL PARTIES OH BOY
DaveMeslin_2010X POLITICAL PARTIES COULD AND SHOULD BE ONE OF THE BASIC ENTRY POINTS FOR PEOPLE TO GET ENGAGED IN POLITICS INSTEAD THEY 'VE BECOME SADLY UNINSPIRING
DaveMeslin_2010X AND UNCREATIVE ORGANIZATIONS THAT RELY SO HEAVILY ON MARKET RESEARCH AND POLLING AND FOCUS GROUPS THAT THEY END UP ALL SAYING THE SAME THING PRETTY MUCH REGURGITATING BACK TO US WHAT WE ALREADY WANT TO HEAR AT THE EXPENSE OF PUTTING FORWARD BOLD AND CREATIVE IDEAS AND PEOPLE CAN SMELL THAT AND IT FEEDS CYNICISM
DaveMeslin_2010X OUR ELECTIONS AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED OUR ELECTIONS IN CANADA ARE A COMPLETE JOKE
DaveMeslin_2010X AND OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE APATHETIC IT 'S LIKE TRYING TO RUN INTO A BRICK WALL NOW I 'M NOT TRYING TO BE NEGATIVE BY THROWING ALL THESE OBSTACLES OUT AND EXPLAINING WHAT 'S IN OUR WAY QUITE THE OPPOSITE I ACTUALLY THINK PEOPLE ARE AMAZING AND SMART AND THAT THEY DO CARE
DaveMeslin_2010X BUT THAT AS I SAID WE LIVE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHERE ALL THESE OBSTACLES ARE BEING PUT
DaveMeslin_2010X IN OUR WAY AS LONG AS WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE OUR OWN NEIGHBORS
DaveMeslin_2010X ARE SELFISH STUPID OR LAZY
DaveMeslin_2010X THEN THERE 'S NO HOPE
DaveMeslin_2010X BUT WE CAN CHANGE ALL THOSE
DaveMeslin_2010X THINGS I MENTIONED WE CAN OPEN UP CITY HALL WE CAN REFORM OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEMS WE CAN DEMOCRATIZE OUR PUBLIC SPACES MY MAIN MESSAGE IS IF WE CAN REDEFINE APATHY NOT AS SOME KIND OF INTERNAL SYNDROME
DaveMeslin_2010X BUT AS A COMPLEX WEB OF CULTURAL BARRIERS THAT REINFORCES DISENGAGEMENT AND IF WE CAN CLEARLY DEFINE
DaveMeslin_2010X WE CAN CLEARLY IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE OBSTACLES ARE
