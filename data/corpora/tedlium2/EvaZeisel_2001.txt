EvaZeisel_2001 ME TO SEE MANY COUNTRIES AND MANY CULTURES I STARTED
EvaZeisel_2001 AS AN APPRENTICE TO A HUNGARIAN CRAFTSMAN AND THIS TAUGHT ME
EvaZeisel_2001 WAS IN MIDDLE AGES THE GUILD SYSTEM THAT MEANS WHEN I WAS AN APPRENTICE I HAD TO APPRENTICE MYSELF IN ORDER TO BECOME
EvaZeisel_2001 IN MY SHOP WHERE I STUDIED
EvaZeisel_2001 AND LEARNED WORKER AND APPRENTICE AND
EvaZeisel_2001 THE WORK AS AN APPRENTICE
EvaZeisel_2001 FEET WHEN IT CAME FROM THE

EvaZeisel_2001 AND THERE I WAS SITTING AND MY THEN BOYFRIEND I DIDN'T MEAN IT WAS A BOYFRIEND LIKE IT IS MEANT
EvaZeisel_2001 AND I SAT AT THE MARKET AND SOLD THE POTS MY MOTHER THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS NOT VERY PROPER SO SHE SAT WITH US TO
