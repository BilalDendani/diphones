TimJackson_2010G@20.54:30.62 FOR A SHARED AND LASTING PROSPERITY AND NOT JUST US BUT THE TWO BILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE WHO ARE STILL CHRONICALLY UNDERNOURISHED AND HOPE
TimJackson_2010G@43.36:50.20 THE IRONY IS THOUGH THAT WE HAVE CASHED OUT PROSPERITY ALMOST LITERALLY IN TERMS OF MONEY
TimJackson_2010G@50.49:59.70 AND ECONOMIC GROWTH AND WE'VE GROWN OUR ECONOMIES SO MUCH THAT WE NOW STAND IN A REAL DANGER OF UNDERMINING HOPE
TimJackson_2010G@68.54:75.82 AND THE ONLY THING THAT HAS ACTUALLY REMOTELY SLOWED DOWN THE RELENTLESS RISE OF CARBON EMISSIONS OVER THE LAST TWO TO THREE DECADES
TimJackson_2010G@85.57:99.26 IT'S A DILEMMA A DILEMMA OF GROWTH WE CAN'T LIVE WITH IT WE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT TRASH THE SYSTEM OR CRASH THE PLANET IT'S A TOUGH CHOICE IT ISN'T MUCH OF A CHOICE AND OUR BEST AVENUE OF ESCAPE FROM THIS ACTUALLY IS A
TimJackson_2010G@121.32:134.82 OF AROUND NINE BILLION PEOPLE ALL ASPIRING TO WESTERN INCOMES WESTERN LIFESTYLES AND I WANT TO ASK THE QUESTION AND WE'LL GIVE THEM THAT TWO PERCENT HIKE IN INCOME IN SALARY EACH YEARS AS WELL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN GROWTH AND I WANT
TimJackson_2010G@135.57:146.00 THE QUESTION HOW FAR AND HOW FAST WOULD BE HAVE TO MOVE HOW CLEVER WOULD WE HAVE TO BE HOW MUCH TECHNOLOGY WOULD WE NEED IN THIS WORLD TO DELIVER OUR CARBON TARGETS AND HERE
TimJackson_2010G@146.28:157.25 IN MY CHART ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE IS WHERE WE ARE NOW THIS IS THE CARBON INTENSITY OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY AT THE MOMENT IT'S AROUND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY GRAMS OF CARBON
TimJackson_2010G@158.14:170.61 IN THE WORLD I DESCRIBE TO YOU WE HAVE TO BE RIGHT OVER HERE AT THE RIGHT HAND SIDE AT SIX GRAMS OF CARBON IT'S A ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOLD IMPROVEMENT AND THAT IS TEN TIMES FURTHER AND FASTER THAN ANYTHING WE'VE EVER ACHIEVED IN INDUSTRIAL HISTORY
TimJackson_2010G@181.18:191.74 BUT SHOULDN 'T WE JUST CHECK FIRST THAT THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IS REMOTELY CAPABLE OF DELIVERING THIS KIND OF IMPROVEMENT SO
TimJackson_2010G@192.13:202.61 I WANT TO JUST SPEND A COUPLE OF MINUTES ON SYSTEM DYNAMICS IT'S A BIT COMPLEX AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT WHAT I'LL TRY AND DO IS I'LL TRY AND PARAPHRASE IT IS SORT OF HUMAN TERMS SO IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS
TimJackson_2010G@203.47:214.66 FIRMS PRODUCE GOODS FOR HOUSEHOLDS THAT'S US AND PROVIDE US WITH INCOMES AND THAT'S EVEN BETTER BECAUSE WE CAN SPEND THOSE INCOMES ON MORE GOODS AND SERVICES THAT'S CALLED THE CIRCULAR FLOW OF THE ECONOMY
TimJackson_2010G@230.28:236.98 WHAT IT DOES ESSENTIALLY IS TO STIMULATE FURTHER CONSUMPTION GROWTH IT DOES THIS IN A COUPLE OF WAYS CHASING
TimJackson_2010G@250.54:263.02 JOSEPH SCHUMPETER CALLED THIS THE PROCESS OF CREATIVE DESTRUCTION IT'S A PROCESS OF THE PRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTION OF NOVELTY CONTINUALLY CHASING EXPANDING CONSUMER MARKETS CONSUMER GOODS NEW CONSUMER GOODS AND THIS
TimJackson_2010G@263.61:272.81 THIS IS WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT HUMAN BEINGS HAVE SOMETHING OF AN APPETITE FOR NOVELTY WE LOVE NEW STUFF
TimJackson_2010G@286.25:299.65 MATERIAL STUFF OPERATES AS A KIND OF LANGUAGE A LANGUAGE OF GOODS A SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE THAT WE USE TO TELL EACH OTHER STORIES STORIES FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT WE ARE
TimJackson_2010G@300.26:308.89 STATUS DRIVEN CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION THRIVES FROM THE LANGUAGE OF NOVELTY AND HERE ALL OF A SUDDEN
TimJackson_2010G@309.28:321.80 WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS LOCKING ECONOMIC STRUCTURE WITH SOCIAL LOGIC THE ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS AND WHO WE ARE AS PEOPLE LOCKED TOGETHER TO DRIVE AN ENGINE OF GROWTH AND THIS ENGINE IS NOT JUST
TimJackson_2010G@334.86:349.22 ADAM SMITH TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO SPOKE ABOUT OUR DESIRE FOR A LIFE WITHOUT SHAME A LIFE WITHOUT SHAME IN HIS DAY WHAT THAT MEANT WAS LINEN SHIRTS AND TODAY WELL YOU STILL NEED THE SHIRT BUT YOU NEED
TimJackson_2010G@349.80:362.90 THE HYBRID CAR THE HDTV TWO HOLIDAYS A YEAR IN THE SUN THE NETBOOK AND IPAD THE LIST GOES ON AN ALMOST INEXHAUSTIBLE SUPPLY OF GOODS DRIVEN BY THIS ANXIETY AND EVEN IF WE DON'T WANT THEM
TimJackson_2010G@363.19:376.56 WE NEED TO BUY THEM BECAUSE IF WE DON'T BUY THEM THE SYSTEM CRASHES AND TO STOP IT CRASHING OVER THE LAST TWO TO THREE DECADES WE'VE EXPANDED THE MONEY SUPPLY EXPANDED CREDIT AND DEBT SO THAT PEOPLE CAN KEEP BUYING STUFF
TimJackson_2010G@388.01:394.86 THE CRASH AND YOU CAN SEE THERE CONSUMER DEBT ROSE DRAMATICALLY IT WAS ABOVE THE GDP FOR THREE YEARS IN A ROW JUST BEFORE THE CRISIS
TimJackson_2010G@395.18:404.74 AND IN THE MEAN TIME PERSONAL SAVINGS ABSOLUTELY PLUMMETED THE SAVINGS RATIO NET SAVINGS WERE BELOW ZERO IN THE MIDDLE OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT JUST BEFORE THE CRASH THIS IS
TimJackson_2010G@417.74:421.35 PEOPLE BEING PERSUADED TO
TimJackson_2010G@422.65:428.60 SPEND MONEY WE DON'T HAVE ON THINGS WE DON'T NEED TO CREATE IMPRESSIONS THAT WON 'T LAST ON PEOPLE WE DON'T CARE ABOUT
TimJackson_2010G@460.79:468.55 BUT SAVING IS EXACTLY THE WRONG THING TO DO FROM THE SYSTEM POINT OF VIEW KEYNES CALLED THIS THE PARADOX OF THRIFT SAVING SLOWS DOWN RECOVERY
TimJackson_2010G@468.92:478.06 AND POLITICIANS CALL ON US CONTINUALLY TO DRAW DOWN MORE DEBT TO DRAW DOWN OUR OWN SAVINGS EVEN FARTHER JUST SO THAT WE CAN GET THE SHOW BACK ON THE ROAD SO WE CAN KEEP
TimJackson_2010G@484.11:490.22 ARE AS PEOPLE HERE 'S ANOTHER ONE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ONE WHY IS IT
TimJackson_2010G@490.37:495.97 THAT WE DON'T DO THE BLINDINGLY OBVIOUS THINGS WE SHOULD DO TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE VERY VERY SIMPLE THINGS LIKE
TimJackson_2010G@496.49:506.92 BUYING ENERGY EFFICIENT APPLIANCES PUTTING IN EFFICIENT LIGHTS TURNING THE LIGHTS OFF OCCASIONALLY INSULATING OUR HOMES THESE THINGS SAVE CARBON THEY SAVE ENERGY THEY SAVE US MONEY
TimJackson_2010G@507.45:517.84 SO IS IT THAT THOUGH THEY MAKE PERFECT ECONOMIC SENSE WE DON'T DO THEM WELL I HAD MY OWN PERSONAL INSIGHT INTO THIS A FEW YEARS AGO IT WAS A SUNDAY EVENING SUNDAY
TimJackson_2010G@519.17:532.33 AND IT WAS JUST AFTER ACTUALLY TO BE HONEST TOO LONG AFTER WE HAD MOVED INTO A NEW HOUSE AND I HAD FINALLY GOT AROUND TO DOING SOME DRAFT STRIPPING INSTALLING INSULATION AROUND THE WINDOWS AND DOORS TO KEEP OUT THE DRAFTS
TimJackson_2010G@532.91:540.68 AND MY THEN FIVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS HELPING ME IN THE WAY THAT FIVE YEAR OLDS DO AND WE'D BEEN DOING THIS FOR A WHILE
TimJackson_2010G@541.13:547.98 WHEN SHE TURNED TO ME VERY SOLEMNLY AND SAID WILL THIS REALLY KEEP OUT THE GIRAFFES
TimJackson_2010G@551.20:561.45 HERE THEY ARE THE GIRAFFES YOU CAN HEAR THE FIVE YEAR OLD MIND WORKING THESE ONES INTERESTINGLY ARE FOUR HUNDRED MILES NORTH OF HERE OUTSIDE BARROW IN FURNESS IN CUMBRIA GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT THEY
TimJackson_2010G@562.07:576.29 OF THE LAKE DISTRICT WEATHER BUT ACTUALLY THAT CHILDISH MISREPRESENTATION STUCK WITH ME BECAUSE IT SUDDENLY BECAME CLEAR TO ME WHY WE DON'T DO THE BLINDINGLY OBVIOUS THINGS WE'RE TOO BUSY KEEPING OUT THE GIRAFFES PUTTING THE KIDS
TimJackson_2010G@576.52:585.50 ON THE BUS IN THE MORNING GETTING OURSELVES TO WORK ON TIME SURVIVING EMAIL OVERLOAD AND SHOP FLOOR POLITICS FORAGING FOR GROCERIES
TimJackson_2010G@585.91:592.66 THROWING TOGETHER MEALS ESCAPING FOR A COUPLE OF PRECIOUS HOURS IN THE EVENING INTO PRIME TIME TV
TimJackson_2010G@593.17:599.36 OR TED ONLINE GETTING FROM ONE END OF THE DAY TO THE OTHER KEEPING OUT THE GIRAFFES
TimJackson_2010G@602.13:613.66 WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CONSUMER MARY DOUGLAS ASKED IN AN ESSAY ON POVERTY WRITTEN THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO IT IS SHE SAID
TimJackson_2010G@614.84:627.75 TO HELP CREATE THE SOCIAL WORLD AND FIND A CREDIBLE PLACE IN IT THAT IS A DEEPLY HUMANIZING VISION OF OUR LIVES AND IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT VISION
TimJackson_2010G@628.35:637.81 THAN THE ONE THAT LIES AT THE HEART OF THIS ECONOMIC MODEL SO WHO ARE WE WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE
TimJackson_2010G@638.39:646.26 ARE WE THESE NOVELTY SEEKING HEDONISTIC SELFISH INDIVIDUALS OR MIGHT WE ACTUALLY OCCASIONALLY BE
TimJackson_2010G@646.82:658.28 SOMETHING LIKE THE SELFLESS ALTRUIST DEPICTED IN REMBRANDT 'S LOVELY LOVELY SKETCH HERE WELL PSYCHOLOGY ACTUALLY SAYS THERE IS A TENSION A TENSION BETWEEN
TimJackson_2010G@658.82:666.76 SELF REGARDING BEHAVIORS AND OTHER REGARDING BEHAVIORS AND THESE TENSIONS HAVE DEEP EVOLUTIONARY ROOTS SO SELFISH BEHAVIOR IS
TimJackson_2010G@667.47:676.38 IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES FIGHT OR FLIGHT BUT OTHER REGARDING BEHAVIORS ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR EVOLUTION AS SOCIAL BEINGS
TimJackson_2010G@700.83:707.28 AND IT REVEALS TO US SUDDENLY THE CRUX OF THE MATTER WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE CREATED ECONOMIES
TimJackson_2010G@716.92:726.04 AND LEFT THE OTHERS UNREGARDED AND IN THE SAME TOKEN THE SOLUTION BECOMES CLEAR BECAUSE THIS ISN 'T THEREFORE ABOUT CHANGING HUMAN NATURE
TimJackson_2010G@726.41:734.47 IT ISN 'T IN FACT ABOUT CURTAILING POSSIBILITIES IT IS ABOUT OPENING UP IT IS ABOUT ALLOWING OURSELVES THE FREEDOM TO BECOME
TimJackson_2010G@734.88:742.22 FULLY HUMAN RECOGNIZING THE DEBT AND THE BREADTH OF THE HUMAN PSYCHE AND BUILDING INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT
TimJackson_2010G@742.78:753.57 REMBRANDT 'S FRAGILE ALTRUIST WITHIN WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN FOR ECONOMICS WHAT WOULD ECONOMIES LOOK LIKE IF WE TOOK THAT VISION
TimJackson_2010G@753.73:768.19 OF HUMAN NATURE AT THEIR HEART AND STRETCHED THEM ALONG THESE ORTHOGONAL DIMENSIONS OF THE HUMAN PSYCHE WELL IT MIGHT LOOK A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE FOUR THOUSAND COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANIES THAT HAVE SPRUNG UP IN THE U K OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS
TimJackson_2010G@768.41:778.98 AND A SIMILAR RISE IN B CORPORATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES ENTERPRISES THAT HAVE ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL GOALS WRITTEN INTO THEIR CONSTITUTION AT THEIR
TimJackson_2010G@791.55:799.85 WHEN YOU DO A SEARCH AND ECOSIA WORKS IN PRETTY MUCH THE SAME WAY SO WE CAN DO THAT HERE WE CAN JUST PUT IN
TimJackson_2010G@800.24:810.55 A LITTLE SEARCH TERM THERE YOU GO OXFORD THAT'S WHERE WE ARE SEE WHAT COMES UP THE DIFFERENCE WITH ECOSIA THOUGH IS THAT IN ECOSIA 'S CASE IT DRAWS THE REVENUES IN THE SAME WAY
TimJackson_2010G@811.35:819.51 BUT IT ALLOCATES EIGHTY PERCENT OF THOSE REVENUES TO A RAINFOREST PROTECTION PROJECT IN THE AMAZON AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT
TimJackson_2010G@828.22:837.10 GAVE REVENUES TO ECOSIA AND ECOSIA IS GIVING EIGHTY PERCENT OF THOSE REVENUES TO A RAINFOREST PROTECTION PROJECT IT'S TAKING PROFITS FROM ONE PLACE
TimJackson_2010G@837.28:848.56 AND ALLOCATING THEM INTO THE PROTECTION OF ECOLOGICAL RESOURCES IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF ENTERPRISE FOR A NEW ECONOMY IT'S A FORM IF YOU LIKE OF ECOLOGICAL ALTRUISM
TimJackson_2010G@860.70:869.23 PUT INVESTMENT BACK INTO THE HEART OF THE MODEL TO RE CONCEIVE INVESTMENT ONLY NOW INVESTMENT ISN'T GOING TO BE ABOUT
TimJackson_2010G@869.66:876.13 THE RELENTLESS AND MINDLESS PURSUIT OF CONSUMPTION GROWTH INVESTMENT HAS TO BE A DIFFERENT BEAST
TimJackson_2010G@885.49:893.59 IT HAS TO BE ABOUT TRANSITION IT HAS TO BE INVESTING IN LOW CARBON TECHNOLOGIES AND INFRASTRUCTURES WE HAVE TO INVEST IN FACT
TimJackson_2010G@894.16:902.84 IN THE IDEA OF A MEANINGFUL PROSPERITY PROVIDING CAPABILITIES FOR PEOPLE TO FLOURISH
TimJackson_2010G@903.20:916.30 AND OF COURSE THIS TASK HAS MATERIAL DIMENSIONS IT WOULD BE NONSENSE TO TALK ABOUT PEOPLE FLOURISHING IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER BUT IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT PROSPERITY GOES BEYOND THIS IT HAS SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL AIMS
TimJackson_2010G@917.09:924.77 FAMILY FRIENDSHIP COMMITMENTS SOCIETY PARTICIPATING IN THE LIFE OF THAT SOCIETY AND THIS
TimJackson_2010G@936.97:945.91 CONCERT HALLS GARDENS PUBLIC PARKS LIBRARIES MUSEUMS QUIET CENTERS PLACES OF JOY AND CELEBRATION PLACES OF
TimJackson_2010G@951.20:959.40 THE CULTIVATION OF A COMMON CITIZENSHIP IN MICHAEL SANDEL 'S LOVELY PHRASE AN INVESTMENT INVESTMENT AFTER ALL IS JUST SUCH A BASIC ECONOMIC
TimJackson_2010G@960.07:966.14 IS NOTHING MORE NOR LESS THAN A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE
TimJackson_2010G@966.67:978.03 A SHARED PRESENT AND A COMMON FUTURE AND WE NEED THAT RELATIONSHIP TO REFLECT TO RECLAIM HOPE SO LET ME COME BACK WITH THIS SENSE OF HOPE
TimJackson_2010G@978.74:987.08 TO THE TWO BILLION PEOPLE STILL TRYING TO LIVE EACH DAY ON LESS THAN THE PRICE OF A SKINNY LATTE FROM THE CAFE NEXT DOOR
TimJackson_2010G@988.41:1000.09 CAN WE OFFER THOSE PEOPLE IT'S CLEAR THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP LIFT THEM OUT OF POVERTY IT'S CLEAR THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE ROOM FOR GROWTH WHERE GROWTH REALLY MATTERS IN THOSE POOREST NATIONS
TimJackson_2010G@1000.47:1010.66 AND IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT WE WILL NEVER ACHIEVE THAT UNLESS WE'RE CAPABLE OF REDEFINING A MEANINGFUL SENSE OF PROSPERITY IN THE RICHER NATIONS A PROSPERITY THAT
TimJackson_2010G@1011.36:1023.90 MORE MEANINGFUL AND LESS MATERIALISTIC THAN THE GROWTH BASED MODEL SO THIS IS NOT JUST A WESTERN POST MATERIALIST FANTASY IN FACT AN AFRICAN PHILOSOPHER WROTE TO ME
TimJackson_2010G@1024.47:1032.32 WHEN PROSPERITY WITHOUT GROWTH WAS PUBLISHED POINTING OUT THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THIS VIEW OF PROSPERITY AND THE TRADITIONAL AFRICAN CONCEPT OF
TimJackson_2010G@1034.37:1041.10 SAYS I AM BECAUSE WE ARE PROSPERITY IS A SHARED ENDEAVOR
TimJackson_2010G@1041.57:1051.23 ITS ROOTS ARE LONG AND DEEP ITS FOUNDATIONS I'VE TRIED TO SHOW EXIST ALREADY INSIDE EACH OF US SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT STANDING IN THE WAY OF DEVELOPMENT
TimJackson_2010G@1052.11:1055.14 IT'S NOT ABOUT OVERTHROWING CAPITALISM
TimJackson_2010G@1055.63:1068.99 IT'S NOT ABOUT TRYING TO CHANGE HUMAN NATURE WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS WE'RE TAKING A FEW SIMPLE STEPS TOWARDS AN ECONOMICS FIT FOR PURPOSE AND AT THE HEART OF THAT ECONOMICS
TimJackson_2010G@1070.03:1071.81 PLACING A MORE CREDIBLE
TimJackson_2010G@1072.30:1081.39 MORE ROBUST AND MORE REALISTIC VISION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TimJackson_2010G@1093.04:1097.51 QUESTION FIRST OF ALL ECONOMISTS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE INSPIRING SO YOU MAY NEED TO WORK ON THE
TimJackson_2010G@1100.63:1107.17 CAN YOU PICTURE THE POLITICIANS EVERY BUYING INTO THIS I MEAN CAN YOU PICTURE A POLITICIAN STANDING UP IN BRITAIN AND SAYING
TimJackson_2010G@1108.38:1113.94 GDP FELL TWO PERCENT THIS YEAR GOOD NEWS WE'RE ACTUALLY ALL HAPPIER AND A COUNTRY 'S MORE BEAUTIFUL AND OUR LIVES ARE BETTER
TimJackson_2010G@1123.84:1133.61 I ALREADY AM SEEING A LITTLE BIT OF IT WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THIS KIND OF WORK POLITICIANS WOULD STAND UP TREASURY SPOKESMEN WOULD STAND UP AND ACCUSE US OF WANTING TO GO BACK AND LIVE IN CAVES
TimJackson_2010G@1133.93:1146.81 AND ACTUALLY IN THE PERIOD THROUGH WHICH WE'VE BEEN WORKING OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND A LITTLE BIT OF HUMILITY IN THE PROFESSION OF ECONOMICS ACTUALLY PEOPLE ARE ENGAGING IN THIS ISSUE IN ALL SORTS OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD
TimJackson_2010G@1147.51:1153.46 IS IT MAINLY POLITICIANS WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER OR IS IT GOING TO BE MORE JUST CIVIL SOCIETY AND COMPANIES
TimJackson_2010G@1153.84:1165.45 IT HAS TO BE COMPANIES IT HAS TO BE CIVIL SOCIETY BUT IT HAS TO HAVE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP THIS IS A KIND OF AGENDA WHICH ACTUALLY POLITICIANS THEMSELVES ARE KIND OF CAUGHT IN THAT DILEMMA BECAUSE
TimJackson_2010G@1166.09:1179.22 HOOKED ON THE GROWTH MODEL THEMSELVES BUT ACTUALLY OPENING UP THE SPACE TO THINK ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS OF GOVERNING DIFFERENT KINDS OF POLITICS AND CREATING THE SPACE FOR CIVIL SOCIETY AND BUSINESSES TO OPERATE DIFFERENTLY ABSOLUTELY VITAL
TimJackson_2010G@1192.73:1202.36 WOULD STILL WANT TO KNOW THAT YOU COULD DO THAT AND GET BELOW ZERO BY THE END OF THE CENTURY IN TERMS OF TAKING CARBON OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF BIODIVERSITY AND REDUCE THE IMPACT ON LAND USE
TimJackson_2010G@1202.63:1210.19 AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE EROSION OF TOPSOILS AND THE QUALITY OF WATER IF YOU CAN CONVINCE ME WE CAN DO ALL THAT THEN YES I WOULD TAKE THE TWO PERCENT
