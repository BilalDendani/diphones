AlexLaskey_2013@17.01:19.17 HOW MANY OF YOU ARE CHECKING IT RIGHT NOW
AlexLaskey_2013@51.06:69.07 AND EVEN WE AREN 'T PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ENERGY USE THAT 'S DRIVING CLIMATE CHANGE THE WOMAN IN THE PHOTO WITH ME IS HARRIET WE MET HER ON OUR FIRST FAMILY VACATION HARRIET 'S PAYING ATTENTION TO HER ENERGY USE AND SHE IS DECIDEDLY NOT AN ENERGY GEEK THIS IS THE STORY OF HOW HARRIET CAME TO PAY ATTENTION
AlexLaskey_2013@76.15:79.73 AND THERE 'S ENOUGH ENERGY IN THIS COAL
AlexLaskey_2013@80.14:83.15 TO LIGHT THIS BULB FOR MORE THAN A YEAR
AlexLaskey_2013@83.58:92.62 BUT UNFORTUNATELY BETWEEN HERE AND HERE MOST OF THAT ENERGY IS LOST TO THINGS LIKE TRANSMISSION LEAKAGE AND HEAT IN FACT ONLY TEN PERCENT ENDS UP AS LIGHT
AlexLaskey_2013@97.38:100.29 IF YOU WANTED TO LIGHT THIS BULB FOR A YEAR
AlexLaskey_2013@110.43:114.86 THAT MEANS THERE 'S GOOD NEWS BECAUSE FOR EVERY UNIT OF ENERGY WE SAVE
AlexLaskey_2013@114.9:116.8 WE SAVE THE OTHER NINE
AlexLaskey_2013@118.75:120.32 SO THE QUESTION IS
AlexLaskey_2013@120.61:123.03 HOW CAN WE GET THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM
AlexLaskey_2013@123.32:124.98 AND ACROSS THE GLOBE
AlexLaskey_2013@125.09:127.79 TO START PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ENERGY WE 'RE USING
AlexLaskey_2013@127.95:129.98 AND START WASTING LESS OF IT
AlexLaskey_2013@130.91:141.32 THE ANSWER COMES FROM A BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE EXPERIMENT THAT WAS RUN ONE HOT SUMMER TEN YEARS AGO AND ONLY NINETY MILES FROM HERE IN SAN MARCOS CALIFORNIA
AlexLaskey_2013@142.51:149.99 GRADUATE STUDENTS PUT SIGNS ON EVERY DOOR IN A NEIGHBORHOOD ASKING PEOPLE TO TURN OFF THEIR AIR CONDITIONING AND TURN ON THEIR FANS
AlexLaskey_2013@150.08:166.75 ONE QUARTER OF THE HOMES RECEIVED A MESSAGE THAT SAID DID YOU KNOW YOU COULD SAVE FIFTY FOUR DOLLARS A MONTH THIS SUMMER TURN OFF YOUR AIR CONDITIONING TURN ON YOUR FANS ANOTHER GROUP GOT AN ENVIRONMENTAL MESSAGE AND STILL A THIRD GROUP GOT A MESSAGE ABOUT BEING GOOD CITIZENS PREVENTING BLACKOUTS MOST PEOPLE GUESSED THAT MONEY SAVING MESSAGE WOULD WORK BEST OF ALL
AlexLaskey_2013@166.75:175.36 IN FACT NONE OF THESE MESSAGES WORKED THEY HAD ZERO IMPACT ON ENERGY CONSUMPTION IT WAS AS IF THE GRAD STUDENTS HADN 'T SHOWN UP AT ALL
AlexLaskey_2013@176.06:189.77 BUT THERE WAS A FOURTH MESSAGE AND THIS MESSAGE SIMPLY SAID WHEN SURVEYED SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF YOUR NEIGHBORS SAID THAT THEY TURNED OFF THEIR AIR CONDITIONING AND TURNED ON THEIR FANS PLEASE JOIN THEM TURN OFF YOUR AIR CONDITIONING AND TURN ON YOUR FANS
AlexLaskey_2013@189.77:199.5 AND WOULDN 'T YOU KNOW IT THEY DID THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVED THIS MESSAGE SHOWED A MARKED DECREASE IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION SIMPLY BY BEING TOLD WHAT THEIR NEIGHBORS WERE DOING
AlexLaskey_2013@211.99:213.58 THAT 'S POWERFUL STUFF
AlexLaskey_2013@214.12:217.16 AND HARNESSED CORRECTLY IT CAN BE A POWERFUL FORCE FOR GOOD
AlexLaskey_2013@217.77:219.5 IN FACT IT ALREADY IS
AlexLaskey_2013@219.83:237.63 INSPIRED BY THIS INSIGHT MY FRIEND DAN YATES AND I STARTED A COMPANY CALLED OPOWER WE BUILT SOFTWARE AND PARTNERED WITH UTILITY COMPANIES WHO WANTED TO HELP THEIR CUSTOMERS SAVE ENERGY WE DELIVER PERSONALIZED HOME ENERGY REPORTS THAT SHOW PEOPLE HOW THEIR CONSUMPTION COMPARES TO THEIR NEIGHBORS IN SIMILAR SIZED HOMES
AlexLaskey_2013@237.63:246.06 JUST LIKE THOSE EFFECTIVE DOOR HANGERS WE HAVE PEOPLE COMPARING THEMSELVES TO THEIR NEIGHBORS AND THEN WE GIVE EVERYONE TARGETED RECOMMENDATIONS TO HELP THEM SAVE
AlexLaskey_2013@246.06:259.16 WE STARTED WITH PAPER WE MOVED TO A MOBILE APPLICATION WEB AND NOW EVEN A CONTROLLABLE THERMOSTAT AND FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE 'VE BEEN RUNNING THE LARGEST BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE EXPERIMENT IN THE WORLD AND IT 'S WORKING
AlexLaskey_2013@259.47:275.01 ORDINARY HOMEOWNERS AND RENTERS HAVE SAVED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ON THEIR ENERGY BILLS AND WE 'RE JUST GETTING STARTED THIS YEAR ALONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MORE THAN EIGHTY UTILITIES IN SIX COUNTRIES WE 'RE GOING TO GENERATE ANOTHER TWO TERAWATT HOURS OF ELECTRICITY SAVINGS
AlexLaskey_2013@275.01:287.2 NOW THE ENERGY GEEKS IN THE ROOM KNOW TWO TERAWATT HOURS BUT FOR THE REST OF US TWO TERAWATT HOURS IS MORE THAN ENOUGH ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME IN ST LOUIS AND SALT LAKE CITY COMBINED FOR MORE THAN A YEAR
AlexLaskey_2013@287.33:293.87 TWO TERAWATT HOURS IT 'S ROUGHLY HALF WHAT THE U S SOLAR INDUSTRY PRODUCED LAST YEAR AND TWO TERAWATT HOURS
AlexLaskey_2013@294.17:295.71 IN TERMS OF COAL
AlexLaskey_2013@295.84:298.48 WE 'D NEED TO BURN THIRTY FOUR OF THESE WHEELBARROWS
AlexLaskey_2013@298.98:310.94 EVERY MINUTE AROUND THE CLOCK EVERY DAY FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR TO GET TWO TERAWATT HOURS OF ELECTRICITY AND WE 'RE NOT BURNING ANYTHING WE 'RE JUST MOTIVATING PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION AND CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR
AlexLaskey_2013@311.06:315.24 BUT WE 'RE JUST ONE COMPANY AND THIS IS JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE
AlexLaskey_2013@315.24:333.61 TWENTY PERCENT OF THE ELECTRICITY IN HOMES IS WASTED AND WHEN I SAY WASTED I DON 'T MEAN THAT PEOPLE HAVE INEFFICIENT LIGHTBULBS THEY MAY I MEAN WE LEAVE THE LIGHTS ON IN EMPTY ROOMS AND WE LEAVE THE AIR CONDITIONING ON WHEN NOBODY 'S HOME THAT 'S FORTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WASTED
AlexLaskey_2013@333.61:339.33 ON ELECTRICITY THAT DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR WELL BEING BUT DOES CONTRIBUTE TO CLIMATE CHANGE
AlexLaskey_2013@339.33:357.64 THAT 'S FORTY BILLION WITH A B EVERY YEAR IN THE U S ALONE THAT 'S HALF OUR COAL USAGE RIGHT THERE NOW THANKFULLY SOME OF THE WORLD 'S BEST MATERIAL SCIENTISTS ARE LOOKING TO REPLACE COAL WITH SUSTAINABLE RESOURCES LIKE THESE AND THIS IS BOTH FANTASTIC AND ESSENTIAL
AlexLaskey_2013@358.38:363.43 BUT THE MOST OVERLOOKED RESOURCE TO GET US TO A SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE IT ISN 'T ON THIS SLIDE
AlexLaskey_2013@372.9:380.05 SIMPLY BY APPLYING BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE WE CAN DO IT TODAY WE KNOW IT WORKS AND IT WILL SAVE US MONEY RIGHT AWAY
AlexLaskey_2013@380.75:383.56 SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR
AlexLaskey_2013@384.54:389.9 WELL IN MOST PLACES UTILITY REGULATION HASN 'T CHANGED MUCH SINCE THOMAS EDISON
AlexLaskey_2013@391.64:395.84 UTILITIES ARE STILL REWARDED WHEN THEIR CUSTOMERS WASTE ENERGY
AlexLaskey_2013@396.18:405.17 THEY OUGHT TO BE REWARDED FOR HELPING THEIR CUSTOMERS SAVE IT BUT THIS STORY IS MUCH MORE THAN ABOUT HOUSEHOLD ENERGY USE TAKE A LOOK AT THE PRIUS
AlexLaskey_2013@405.23:420.43 IT 'S EFFICIENT NOT ONLY BECAUSE TOYOTA INVESTED IN MATERIAL SCIENCE BUT BECAUSE THEY INVESTED IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE THE DASHBOARD THAT SHOWS DRIVERS HOW MUCH ENERGY THEY 'RE SAVING IN REAL TIME MAKES FORMER SPEED DEMONS DRIVE MORE LIKE CAUTIOUS GRANDMOTHERS WHICH BRINGS US BACK
AlexLaskey_2013@420.57:430.17 TO HARRIET WE MET HER ON OUR FIRST FAMILY VACATION SHE CAME OVER TO MEET MY YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHE WAS TICKLED TO LEARN THAT MY DAUGHTER 'S NAME IS ALSO HARRIET
AlexLaskey_2013@430.17:445.38 SHE ASKED ME WHAT I DID FOR A LIVING AND I TOLD HER I WORK WITH UTILITIES TO HELP PEOPLE SAVE ENERGY IT WAS THEN THAT HER EYES LIT UP SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SHE SAID YOU 'RE EXACTLY THE PERSON I NEED TO TALK TO YOU SEE TWO WEEKS AGO MY HUSBAND AND I GOT A LETTER IN THE MAIL FROM OUR UTILITY
AlexLaskey_2013@446:449.2 IT TOLD US WE WERE USING TWICE AS MUCH ENERGY AS OUR NEIGHBORS
AlexLaskey_2013@452.33:462.05 AND FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS ALL WE CAN THINK ABOUT TALK ABOUT AND EVEN ARGUE ABOUT IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING TO SAVE ENERGY WE DID EVERYTHING THAT LETTER TOLD US TO DO
AlexLaskey_2013@462.48:464.51 AND STILL I KNOW THERE MUST BE MORE
AlexLaskey_2013@465.3:468.2 NOW I 'M HERE WITH A GENUINE EXPERT TELL ME
AlexLaskey_2013@468.27:470.37 WHAT SHOULD I DO TO SAVE ENERGY
AlexLaskey_2013@471.66:475.16 THERE ARE MANY EXPERTS WHO CAN HELP ANSWER HARRIET 'S QUESTION
