JohnFrancis_2008@129.89:141.67 WELL I WANT TO TAKE YOU ON THIS JOURNEY AND THE JOURNEY I BELIEVE IS A METAPHOR FOR ALL OF OUR JOURNEYS AND SO EVEN THOUGH THIS ONE IS KIND OF UNUSUAL I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT
JohnFrancis_2008@153.80:156.29 COLLIDE BENEATH THE GOLDEN GATE AND
JohnFrancis_2008@156.89:159.01 A HALF A MILLION GALLONS OF OIL
JohnFrancis_2008@161.57:169.44 IT DISTURBED ME SO MUCH THAT I DECIDED THAT I WAS GOING TO GIVE UP RIDING AND DRIVING IN MOTORIZED VEHICLES
JohnFrancis_2008@174.04:186.05 AND IT WAS A BIG THING IN MY LITTLE COMMUNITY OF POINT REYES STATION IN INVERNESS CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THERE WAS ONLY ABOUT MAYBE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE THERE IN THE WINTER A THIS WAS BACK IN SEVENTY ONE
JohnFrancis_2008@187.27:190.51 AND SO WHEN I CAME IN AND I STARTED WALKING AROUND
JohnFrancis_2008@192.13:201.86 PEOPLE THEY JUST KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND PEOPLE WOULD DRIVE UP NEXT TO ME AND SAY JOHN WHAT ARE YOU DOING AND I A D SAY WELL I A M WALKING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
JohnFrancis_2008@202.38:214.06 AND THEY SAID NO YOU A RE WALKING TO MAKE US LOOK BAD RIGHT YOU A RE WALKING TO MAKE US FEEL BAD AND MAYBE THERE WAS SOME TRUTH TO THAT BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT IF I STARTED WALKING EVERYONE WOULD YOU KNOW FOLLOW
JohnFrancis_2008@215.29:218.65 BECAUSE OF THE OIL EVERYBODY TALKED ABOUT THE POLLLUTION AND SO
JohnFrancis_2008@219.55:223.40 I ARGUED WITH PEOPLE ABOUT THAT I ARGUED AND I ARGUED

JohnFrancis_2008@280.80:282.46 AND WHAT I HEARD
JohnFrancis_2008@283.05:292.88 IT KIND OF DISTURBED ME BECAUSE WHAT I USED TO DO WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS LISTENING WAS I WOULD LISTEN JUST ENOUGH TO HEAR WHAT PEOPLE HAD TO SAY AND THINK THAT I COULD
JohnFrancis_2008@293.24:303.54 I KNEW WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO SAY AND SO I STOPPED LISTENING AND IN MY MIND I JUST KIND OF RACED AHEAD AND THOUGHT OF WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY BACK WHILE THEY WERE STILL FINISHING UP
JohnFrancis_2008@304.65:305.85 AND THEN I WOULD LAUNCH IN WELL
JohnFrancis_2008@307.15:309.43 JUST ENDED COMMUNICATION
JohnFrancis_2008@310.57:322.15 SO ON THIS FIRST DAY I ACTUALLY LISTENED AND IT WAS VERY SAD FOR ME BECAUSE I REALIZED THAT FOR THOSE MANY YEARS I HAD NOT BEEN LEARNING I WAS TWENTY SEVEN I THOUGHT I KNEW EVERYTHING

JohnFrancis_2008@534.03:539.85 AND I HAD THIRTEEN STUDENTS WHEN I FIRST WALKED INTO THE CLASS AND I EXPLAINED WITH A FRIEND WHO COULD
JohnFrancis_2008@557.48:561.02 I COULD SEE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR THE SCHEDULE TO SEE WHEN THEY COULD GET OUT
JohnFrancis_2008@563.29:570.56 THEY HAD TO TAKE THAT CLASS WITH ME TWO WEEKS LATER EVERYONE WAS TRYING TO GET INTO OUR CLASS AND I LEARNED IN THAT CLASS BECAUSE I WOULD DO THINGS LIKE THIS
JohnFrancis_2008@597.54:604.31 BUT WHAT I LEARNED WAS THAT SOMETIMES I WOULD MAKE A SIGN AND THEY SAID THINGS THAT I ABSOLUTELY DID NOT MEAN
JohnFrancis_2008@605.75:606.59 BUT I SHOULD HAVE
JohnFrancis_2008@608.71:616.62 AND SO WHAT CAME TO ME IS IF YOU WERE A TEACHER AND YOU WERE TEACHING IF YOU WEREN A T LEARNING YOU PROBABLY WEREN A T TEACHING VERY WELL
JohnFrancis_2008@632.56:636.42 I HUNCHED MY SHOULDER I GOT MY BACKPACK AND I WENT ON TO THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN

JohnFrancis_2008@714.36:718.31 ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF THE SILENCE THE LISTENING TO EACH OTHER
JohnFrancis_2008@719.94:722.84 REALLY VERY IMPORTANT WE NEED TO LISTEN TO EACH OTHER
JohnFrancis_2008@725.74:727.23 MY JOURNEY KEPT GOING ON

JohnFrancis_2008@780.46:786.09 ONE YEAR 'S ENOUGH FOR ME TO DO THAT I GOT ON A SAILBOAT AND I SAILED DOWN TO THE CARIBBEAN AND
JohnFrancis_2008@793.53:805.33 YOU KNOW I FORGOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHICH IS WHY I STARTED TALKING WHICH I HAVE TO TELL YOU I STARTED TALKING BECAUSE I HAD STUDIED ENVIRONMENT
JohnFrancis_2008@813.20:816.92 AND THE INFORMAL LEVEL I LEARNED ABOUT
JohnFrancis_2008@817.55:820.45 PEOPLE AND WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE ARE
JohnFrancis_2008@827.73:829.29 HOW WE TREATED EACH OTHER
JohnFrancis_2008@830.57:835.59 BECAUSE IF WE ARE THE ENVIRONMENT THEN ALL WE NEED TO DO IS LOOK AROUND US AND SEE
JohnFrancis_2008@836.57:839.27 WE TREAT OURSELVES AND HOW WE TREAT EACH OTHER
JohnFrancis_2008@841.10:848.53 AND SO THAT A S THE MESSAGE THAT I HAD AND I SAID WELL I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SPREAD THAT MESSAGE AND I GOT IN MY SAILBOAT SAILED ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE CARIBBEAN

JohnFrancis_2008@938.57:944.03 I WAS A PRISONER AND I NEEDED TO ESCAPE THE PRISON THAT I WAS IN
JohnFrancis_2008@944.77:947.80 WAS THE FACT THAT I DID NOT DRIVE
JohnFrancis_2008@948.39:955.68 OR USE MOTORIZED VEHICLES NOW HOW COULD THAT BE BECAUSE WHEN I STARTED IT SEEMED VERY APPROPRIATE TO ME
JohnFrancis_2008@965.85:967.69 MY DECISION TO JUST
