BillGates_2013S IT DOESN 'T MATTER WHETHER YOU 'RE A BASKETBALL PLAYER
BillGates_2013S A TENNIS PLAYER A GYMNAST
BillGates_2013S WE ALL NEED PEOPLE WHO WILL GIVE US FEEDBACK
BillGates_2013S THAT 'S HOW WE IMPROVE
BillGates_2013S UNFORTUNATELY THERE 'S ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO GET ALMOST NO SYSTEMATIC FEEDBACK TO HELP THEM DO THEIR JOBS BETTER AND THESE PEOPLE HAVE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS IN THE WORLD
BillGates_2013S I 'M TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS
BillGates_2013S WHEN MELINDA AND I LEARNED HOW LITTLE USEFUL FEEDBACK MOST TEACHERS GET WE WERE BLOWN AWAY UNTIL RECENTLY OVER NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF TEACHERS JUST GOT ONE WORD OF FEEDBACK
BillGates_2013S SATISFACTORY
BillGates_2013S IF ALL MY BRIDGE COACH EVER TOLD ME WAS THAT I WAS SATISFACTORY I WOULD HAVE NO HOPE OF EVER GETTING BETTER HOW WOULD I KNOW
BillGates_2013S OUR TEACHERS DESERVE BETTER
BillGates_2013S THE SYSTEM WE HAVE TODAY ISN 'T FAIR TO THEM IT 'S NOT FAIR TO STUDENTS AND IT 'S PUTTING AMERICA 'S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AT RISK
BillGates_2013S SO TODAY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN HELP ALL TEACHERS GET THE TOOLS FOR IMPROVEMENT THEY WANT AND DESERVE LET 'S START BY ASKING WHO 'S DOING WELL
BillGates_2013S CONSIDER THE RANKINGS FOR READING PROFICIENCY
BillGates_2013S THE U S ISN 'T NUMBER ONE WE 'RE NOT EVEN IN THE TOP TEN WE 'RE TIED FOR FIFTEENTH WITH ICELAND AND POLAND
BillGates_2013S NOW OUT OF ALL THE PLACES THAT DO BETTER THAN THE U S IN READING HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE A FORMAL SYSTEM FOR HELPING TEACHERS IMPROVE
BillGates_2013S SO THERE 'S REALLY ONLY ONE AREA WHERE WE 'RE NEAR THE TOP AND THAT 'S IN FAILING TO GIVE OUR TEACHERS THE HELP THEY NEED TO DEVELOP THEIR SKILLS LET 'S LOOK AT THE BEST ACADEMIC PERFORMER
BillGates_2013S THE PROVINCE OF SHANGHAI CHINA NOW THEY RANK NUMBER ONE ACROSS THE BOARD IN READING MATH AND SCIENCE AND ONE OF THE KEYS TO SHANGHAI 'S INCREDIBLE SUCCESS IS THE WAY THEY HELP TEACHERS KEEP IMPROVING
BillGates_2013S THEY MADE SURE THAT YOUNGER TEACHERS GET A CHANCE TO WATCH MASTER TEACHERS AT WORK THEY HAVE WEEKLY STUDY GROUPS WHERE TEACHERS GET TOGETHER AND TALK ABOUT WHAT 'S WORKING THEY EVEN REQUIRE EACH TEACHER TO OBSERVE AND GIVE FEEDBACK TO THEIR COLLEAGUES
BillGates_2013S YOU MIGHT ASK WHY IS A SYSTEM LIKE THIS SO IMPORTANT
BillGates_2013S IT 'S BECAUSE THERE 'S SO MUCH VARIATION IN THE TEACHING PROFESSION
BillGates_2013S SOME TEACHERS ARE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHERS
BillGates_2013S IN FACT THERE ARE TEACHERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WHO ARE HELPING THEIR STUDENTS MAKE EXTRAORDINARY GAINS IF TODAY 'S AVERAGE TEACHER COULD BECOME AS GOOD AS THOSE TEACHERS OUR STUDENTS WOULD BE BLOWING AWAY THE REST OF THE WORLD
BillGates_2013S SO WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS BE AS GOOD AS THE BEST
BillGates_2013S WHAT WOULD THAT SYSTEM LOOK LIKE
BillGates_2013S WELL TO FIND OUT
BillGates_2013S WE HAD OBSERVERS WATCH VIDEOS OF TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM AND RATE HOW THEY DID ON A RANGE OF PRACTICES FOR EXAMPLE DID THEY ASK THEIR STUDENTS CHALLENGING QUESTIONS DID THEY FIND MULTIPLE WAYS TO EXPLAIN AN IDEA
BillGates_2013S WE ALSO HAD STUDENTS FILL OUT SURVEYS WITH QUESTIONS LIKE DOES YOUR TEACHER KNOW WHEN THE CLASS UNDERSTANDS A LESSON DO YOU LEARN TO CORRECT YOUR MISTAKES
BillGates_2013S AND WHAT WE FOUND IS VERY EXCITING FIRST
BillGates_2013S THE TEACHERS WHO DID WELL ON THESE OBSERVATIONS
BillGates_2013S I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT THIS VIDEO COMPONENT OF MET
BillGates_2013S LOOKS LIKE IN ACTION
BillGates_2013S MY NAME IS SARAH BROWN WESSLING I AM A HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH TEACHER AT JOHNSTON HIGH SCHOOL IN JOHNSTON IOWA TURN TO SOMEBODY NEXT TO YOU TELL THEM WHAT YOU THINK I MEAN WHEN I TALK ABOUT MOVES TO PROVE I 'VE TALK ABOUT I THINK THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE FOR TEACHERS BETWEEN
BillGates_2013S THE ABSTRACT OF HOW WE SEE OUR PRACTICE AND THEN THE CONCRETE REALITY OF IT OKAY SO I WOULD LIKE YOU TO PLEASE BRING UP YOUR PAPERS I THINK WHAT VIDEO OFFERS FOR US IS A CERTAIN DEGREE OF REALITY YOU CAN 'T REALLY DISPUTE WHAT YOU SEE ON THE VIDEO
BillGates_2013S AND THERE IS A LOT TO BE LEARNED FROM THAT AND THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS THAT WE CAN GROW AS A PROFESSION
BillGates_2013S WHEN WE ACTUALLY GET TO SEE THIS I JUST HAVE A FLIP CAMERA AND A LITTLE TRIPOD AND INVESTED IN THIS TINY LITTLE WIDE ANGLE LENS
BillGates_2013S AT THE BEGINNING OF CLASS I JUST PERCH IT IN THE BACK OF THE CLASSROOM IT 'S NOT A PERFECT SHOT IT DOESN 'T CATCH EVERY LITTLE THING THAT 'S GOING ON BUT I CAN HEAR THE SOUND I CAN SEE A LOT AND I 'M ABLE TO LEARN A LOT FROM IT SO IT REALLY HAS BEEN A SIMPLE BUT POWERFUL TOOL IN MY OWN REFLECTION
BillGates_2013S ONCE I 'M FINISHED TAPING THEN I PUT IT IN MY COMPUTER AND THEN I 'LL SCAN IT AND TAKE A PEEK AT IT IF I DON 'T WRITE THINGS DOWN I DON 'T REMEMBER THEM SO HAVING THE NOTES IS A PART OF MY THINKING PROCESS AND I DISCOVER WHAT I 'M SEEING AS I 'M WRITING
BillGates_2013S AND THEN HELP OUR BROADER COMMUNITIES UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS COMPLEX WORK IS REALLY ALL ABOUT
BillGates_2013S I THINK IT IS A WAY TO EXEMPLIFY AND ILLUSTRATE THINGS THAT WE CANNOT CONVEY IN A LESSON PLAN THINGS YOU CANNOT CONVEY IN A STANDARD THINGS THAT YOU CANNOT EVEN SOMETIMES CONVEY IN A BOOK OF PEDAGOGY
BillGates_2013S BUT WE STILL HAVE MORE WORK TO DO
BillGates_2013S DIAGNOSING AREAS WHERE A TEACHER NEEDS TO IMPROVE IS ONLY HALF THE BATTLE
BillGates_2013S WE ALSO HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO ACT ON THE DIAGNOSIS
BillGates_2013S IF YOU LEARN THAT YOU NEED TO IMPROVE THE WAY YOU TEACH FRACTIONS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO WATCH A VIDEO OF THE BEST PERSON IN THE WORLD TEACHING FRACTIONS
BillGates_2013S SO BUILDING THIS COMPLETE TEACHER FEEDBACK AND IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM WON 'T BE EASY
BillGates_2013S FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW SOME TEACHERS AREN 'T IMMEDIATELY COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA OF A CAMERA IN THE CLASSROOM
BillGates_2013S THAT 'S UNDERSTANDABLE BUT OUR EXPERIENCE WITH MET
BillGates_2013S SUGGESTS THAT IF TEACHERS MANAGE THE PROCESS IF THEY COLLECT VIDEO IN THEIR OWN CLASSROOMS AND THEY PICK THE LESSONS THEY WANT TO SUBMIT A LOT OF THEM WILL BE EAGER TO PARTICIPATE BUILDING THIS SYSTEM WILL ALSO REQUIRE A CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT
BillGates_2013S OUR FOUNDATION ESTIMATES THAT IT COULD COST UP TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
BillGates_2013S NOW THAT 'S A BIG NUMBER BUT TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE IT 'S LESS THAN TWO PERCENT OF WHAT WE SPEND EVERY YEAR ON TEACHER SALARIES
BillGates_2013S THE IMPACT FOR TEACHERS WOULD BE PHENOMENAL
BillGates_2013S WE WOULD FINALLY HAVE A WAY TO GIVE THEM FEEDBACK
BillGates_2013S AS WELL AS THE MEANS TO ACT ON IT
BillGates_2013S BUT THIS SYSTEM WOULD HAVE AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT BENEFIT FOR OUR COUNTRY IT WOULD PUT US ON A PATH TO MAKING SURE ALL OUR STUDENTS GET A GREAT EDUCATION FIND A CAREER THAT 'S FULFILLING AND REWARDING AND HAVE A CHANCE TO LIVE OUT THEIR DREAMS
BillGates_2013S THIS WOULDN 'T JUST MAKE US A MORE SUCCESSFUL COUNTRY
BillGates_2013S IT WOULD ALSO MAKE US A MORE FAIR AND JUST ONE TOO
BillGates_2013S I 'M EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE ALL OUR TEACHERS THE SUPPORT THEY WANT AND DESERVE
