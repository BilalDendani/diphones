RicElias_2011U@25.58:28.85 IMAGINE AN ENGINE GOING CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK
RicElias_2011U@39.86:53.16 AND THEY SAID NO PROBLEM WE PROBABLY HIT SOME BIRDS THE PILOT HAD ALREADY TURNED THE PLANE AROUND AND WE WEREN 'T THAT FAR YOU COULD SEE MANHATTAN TWO MINUTES LATER THREE THINGS HAPPENED AT THE SAME TIME
RicElias_2011U@53.16:60.71 THE PILOT LINES UP THE PLANE WITH THE HUDSON RIVER THAT 'S USUALLY NOT THE ROUTE
RicElias_2011U@82.05:94.3 COULD SEE IN HER EYES IT WAS TERROR LIFE WAS OVER NOW I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THREE THINGS I LEARNED ABOUT MYSELF THAT DAY I LEARNED THAT IT ALL CHANGES IN AN INSTANT
RicElias_2011U@107.92:125.76 AS I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT LATER ON I CAME UP WITH A SAYING WHICH IS I COLLECT BAD WINES BECAUSE IF THE WINE IS READY AND THE PERSON IS THERE I 'M OPENING IT I NO LONGER WANT TO POSTPONE ANYTHING IN LIFE AND THAT URGENCY THAT PURPOSE HAS REALLY CHANGED MY LIFE
RicElias_2011U@125.76:134.15 THE SECOND THING I LEARNED THAT DAY AND THIS IS AS WE CLEAR THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE WHICH WAS BY NOT A LOT
RicElias_2011U@154.6:167.79 AND I THOUGHT ABOUT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY WIFE WITH MY FRIENDS WITH PEOPLE AND AFTER AS I REFLECTED ON THAT I DECIDED TO ELIMINATE NEGATIVE ENERGY FROM MY LIFE IT 'S NOT PERFECT BUT IT 'S A LOT BETTER
RicElias_2011U@177.36:194.87 THE THIRD THING I LEARNED AND THIS IS AS YOUR MENTAL CLOCK STARTS GOING FIFTEEN FOURTEEN THIRTEEN YOU CAN SEE THE WATER COMING I 'M SAYING PLEASE BLOW UP I DON 'T WANT THIS THING TO BREAK IN TWENTY PIECES LIKE YOU 'VE SEEN IN THOSE DOCUMENTARIES AND AS WE 'RE COMING DOWN I HAD A SENSE OF

RicElias_2011U@205.48:224.72 AND THAT SADNESS REALLY FRAMED IN ONE THOUGHT WHICH IS I ONLY WISH FOR ONE THING I ONLY WISH I COULD SEE MY KIDS GROW UP ABOUT A MONTH LATER I WAS AT A PERFORMANCE BY MY DAUGHTER FIRST GRADER NOT MUCH ARTISTIC TALENT
RicElias_2011U@250.58:255.91 I WAS GIVEN THE GIFT OF A MIRACLE OF NOT DYING THAT DAY I WAS GIVEN ANOTHER GIFT
RicElias_2011U@255.91:266.2 WHICH WAS TO BE ABLE TO SEE INTO THE FUTURE AND COME BACK AND LIVE DIFFERENTLY I CHALLENGE YOU GUYS THAT ARE FLYING TODAY
RicElias_2011U@266.2:285.63 IMAGINE THE SAME THING HAPPENS ON YOUR PLANE AND PLEASE DON 'T BUT IMAGINE AND HOW WOULD YOU CHANGE WHAT WOULD YOU GET DONE THAT YOU 'RE WAITING TO GET DONE BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU 'LL BE HERE FOREVER HOW WOULD YOU CHANGE YOUR RELATIONSHIPS AND THE NEGATIVE ENERGY IN THEM AND MORE THAN ANYTHING ARE YOU BEING THE BEST PARENT YOU CAN THANK YOU
