GarikIsraelian_2009G A VERY DIFFICULT TASK I'M A SPECTROSCOPIST I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
GarikIsraelian_2009G SHOWING YOU ANY SINGLE IMAGE OF NEBULAE OR GALAXIES ETC BECAUSE MY JOB IS SPECTROSCOPY I NEVER DEAL WITH IMAGES
GarikIsraelian_2009G BUT I'LL TRY TO CONVINCE YOU THAT SPECTROSCOPY IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING WHICH CAN CHANGE THIS WORLD
GarikIsraelian_2009G IT'S NOT VERY FUN TO DO SPECTROSCOPY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES IN BULGARIA NEVIANA MARKOVA SPENT ABOUT TWENTY YEARS STUDYING THESE PROFILES AND SHE PUBLISHED FORTY TWO ARTICLES JUST DEDICATED TO THE SUBJECT
GarikIsraelian_2009G CAN YOU IMAGINE DAY AND NIGHT THINKING OBSERVING THE SAME STAR FOR TWENTY YEARS IS INCREDIBLE BUT WE ARE CRAZY WE DO THESE THINGS
GarikIsraelian_2009G AND I'M NOT THAT FAR I SPENT ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS WORKING ON THESE PROFILES BECAUSE
GarikIsraelian_2009G A VERY SMALL SYMMETRY IN THE PROFILE OF ONE OF THE PLANET HOST STARS AND I THOUGHT WELL MAYBE THERE IS LITHIUM SIX IN THIS STAR WHICH IS AND INDICATION THAT THIS STAR HAS SWALLOWED A PLANET
GarikIsraelian_2009G BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT IF YOU ARE HAVING A TELESCOPE YOU ARE AN ASTRONOMER SO WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS ACTUALLY LOOKING IN A TELESCOPE AND YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE PLANET GOING INTO A STAR AND I WAS SAYING NO EXCUSE ME
GarikIsraelian_2009G I SEE IS THIS ONE IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE BECAUSE NOBODY UNDERSTOOD
GarikIsraelian_2009G I BET THAT THERE WERE VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THIS IS THE INDICATION THAT THE PLANET WENT INTO THE STAR IT'S AMAZING
GarikIsraelian_2009G THE POWER OF SPECTROSCOPY WAS ACTUALLY REALIZED BY PINK FLOYD ALREADY
GarikIsraelian_2009G BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY SAID THAT YOU CAN GET ANY COLOR
GarikIsraelian_2009G YOU LIKE IN A SPECTRUM AND ALL YOU NEED IS TIME AND MONEY TO MAKE YOUR SPECTROGRAPH THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE HIGH RESOLUTION MOST PRECISE SPECTROGRAPH ON THIS PLANET CALLED HARPS
GarikIsraelian_2009G WHICH IS ACTUALLY USED TO DETECT EXTRASOLAR PLANETS AND SOUND WAVES IN THE ATMOSPHERES OF STARS HOW WE GET SPECTRA
GarikIsraelian_2009G I'M SURE MOST OF YOU KNOW FROM SCHOOL PHYSICS THAT IT'S BASICALLY SPLITTING A WHITE LIGHT
GarikIsraelian_2009G TO COLORS AND IF YOU HAVE A LIQUID HOT MASS IT WILL PRODUCE SOMETHING WHICH WE CALL A CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM A HOT GAS IS PRODUCING EMISSION LINES ONLY
GarikIsraelian_2009G NO CONTINUUM AND IF YOU PLACE A COOL GAS IN FRONT OF A HOT SOURCE YOU WILL SEE CERTAIN PATTERNS WHICH WE CALL ABSORPTION LINES
GarikIsraelian_2009G WHICH IS USED ACTUALLY TO IDENTIFY CHEMICAL ELEMENTS IN A COOL MATTER WHICH IS ABSORBING EXACTLY AT THOSE FREQUENCIES NOW WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE SPECTRA
GarikIsraelian_2009G WE CAN ACTUALLY STUDY LINE OF SIGHT VELOCITIES OF COSMIC OBJECTS AND WE CAN ALSO STUDY CHEMICAL COMPOSTION AND PHYSICAL PARAMETERS OF STARS GALAXIES
GarikIsraelian_2009G A STAR IS THE MOST SIMPLE OBJECT IN THE CORE WE HAVE THERMONUCLEAR REACTIONS GOING ON CREATING CHEMICAL ELEMENTS AND WE HAVE A COOL ATMOSPHERE IT'S COOL FOR ME COOL IN MY TERMS IS
GarikIsraelian_2009G COOL FOR THEM BUT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING IS RELATIVE SO FOR ME FIVE THOUSAND DEGREES IS
GarikIsraelian_2009G THIS IS THE SPECTRUM OF THE SUN TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND SPECTRAL LINES AND ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THESE LINES IS NOT YET IDENTIFIED IT IS AMAZING SO WE ARE IN THE TWENTY ONE ST CENTURY AND WE STILL CAN NOT PROPERLY
GarikIsraelian_2009G IS THE ONLY SPECTRAL LINE IN THE SPECTRUM OF THE SUN AND WE USE THIS WEAK FEATURE TO MEASURE THE COMPOSITION OF GOLD IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE SUN
GarikIsraelian_2009G AND NOW THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH A SIMILARLY VERY WEAK FEATURE WHICH BELONGS TO OSMIUM IT'S A HEAVY ELEMENT PRODUCED IN THERMONUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS OF SUPERNOVAE
GarikIsraelian_2009G THE ONLY PLACE WHERE YOU CAN PRODUCE ACTUALLY OSMIUM JUST COMPARING THE COMPOSITION OF OSMIUM IN ONE OF THE PLANET HOST STARS
GarikIsraelian_2009G WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS SO MUCH OF THIS ELEMENT PERHAPS WE EVEN THINK THAT MAYBE SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS TRIGGER FORMATIONS OF PLANETS AND STARS IT CAN BE AN INDICATION
GarikIsraelian_2009G THE OTHER DAY MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY GIBOR BASRI EMAILED ME A VERY INTERESTING SPECTRUM ASKING ME CAN YOU HAVE A LOOK AT THIS
GarikIsraelian_2009G AND I COULDN'T SLEEP NEXT TWO WEEKS WHEN I SAW THE HUGE AMOUNT OF OXYGEN AND OTHER ELEMENTS IN THE SPECTRUM OF THE STARS I KNEW THAT THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THAT OBSERVED IN THE GALAXY
GarikIsraelian_2009G IT WAS INCREDIBLE THE ONLY CONCLUSION WE COULD MAKE FROM THIS IS CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION IN THIS SYSTEM WHICH POLLUTED THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS STAR AND LATER A BLACK HOLE WAS FORMED
GarikIsraelian_2009G IN A BINARY SYSTEM WHICH IS STILL THERE WITH A MASS OF ABOUT FIVE SOLAR MASSES THIS WAS CONSIDERED AS FIRST EVIDENCE THAT ACTUALLY BLACK HOLES COME FROM SUPERNOVAE EXPLOSIONS
GarikIsraelian_2009G MY COLLEAGUES COMPARING COMPOSITION OF CHEMICAL ELEMENTS IN DIFFERENT GALACTIC STARS ACTUALLY DISCOVERED ALIEN STARS IN OUR GALAXY
GarikIsraelian_2009G ONE OF THE STARS YOU SEE IN THE SPECTRA IS AN ALIEN IT COMES FROM A DIFFERENT GALAXY THERE IS INTERACTION OF GALAXIES WE KNOW THIS AND SOMETIMES THEY JUST CAPTURE STARS
GarikIsraelian_2009G HEARD ABOUT SOLAR FLARES WE WERE VERY SURPRISED TO DISCOVER A SUPER FLARE
GarikIsraelian_2009G A FLARE WHICH IS THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN THOSE WE SEE IN THE SUN IN ONE OF THE BINARY STARS IN OUR GALAXY CALLED
GarikIsraelian_2009G WE DISCOVERED THE SUPER FLARE AND LATER WE WENT TO STUDY THE SPECTRAL LINES TO SEE IS THERE ANYTHING STRANGE WITH THESE OBJECTS AND WE FOUND THAT EVERYTHING IS NORMAL
GarikIsraelian_2009G STARS ARE NORMAL LIKE THE SUN AGE EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL SO THIS IS A MYSTERY IT'S ONE OF THE MYSTERIES WE STILL HAVE SUPER FLARES AND THERE ARE SIX OR SEVEN SIMILAR CASES
GarikIsraelian_2009G TO GO AHEAD WITH THIS WE REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND CHEMICAL EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE IT'S VERY COMPLICATED I DON'T REALLY WANT YOU TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HERE
GarikIsraelian_2009G BUT IT'S TO SHOW YOU HOW
GarikIsraelian_2009G AND DOING THIS FOR FOURTEEN BILLION YEARS WE END UP WITH THIS PICTURE WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT GRAPH SHOWING RELATIVE ABUNDANCES OF CHEMICAL ELEMENTS IN SUN LIKE STARS AND IN THE INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM
GarikIsraelian_2009G SO WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND AN OBJECT WHERE YOU FIND ABOUT TEN TIMES MORE SULFUR
GarikIsraelian_2009G FIVE TIMES MORE CALCIUM THAN OXYGEN IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE AND IF YOU FIND ONE I WILL SAY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING RELATED TO SETI BECAUSE NATURALLY YOU
GarikIsraelian_2009G DOPPLER EFFECT IS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT FROM FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS AND THIS IS RELATED TO THE CHANGE OF THE FREQUENCY OF A MOVING SOURCE THE DOPPLER EFFECT IS USED TO DISCOVER EXTRASOLAR PLANETS
GarikIsraelian_2009G THE PRECISION WHICH WE NEED TO DISCOVER A JUPITER LIKE PLANET AROUND A SUN LIKE STAR IS SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY EIGHT POINT FOUR METERS PER SECOND AND WE NEED NINE CENTIMETERS PER SECOND TO DETECT AN EARTH LIKE PLANET
GarikIsraelian_2009G THIS CAN BE DONE WITH THE FUTURE SPECTROGRAPHS I MYSELF I'M ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THE TEAM WHICH IS DEVELOPING A CODEX HIGH RESOLUTION FUTURE GENERATION SPECTROGRAPH FOR THE FORTY
GarikIsraelian_2009G TELESCOPE AND THIS IS GOING TO BE AN INSTRUMENT TO DETECT EARTH LIKE PLANETS AROUND SUN LIKE STARS IT IS AN AMAZING TOOL CALLED ASTROSEISMOLOGY WHERE WE CAN DETECT SOUND WAVES
GarikIsraelian_2009G IN THE ATMOSPHERES OF STARS
GarikIsraelian_2009G WE CAN DETECT SOUND WAVES IN THE ATMOSPHERES OF SUN LIKE STARS THOSE WAVES HAVE FREQUENCIES IN INFRASOUND DOMAIN THE
GarikIsraelian_2009G COMING BACK TO THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE THIS IS CLOSELY RELATED TO TECTONIC AND VOLCANIC ACTIVITY OF PLANETS
GarikIsraelian_2009G CONNECTION BETWEEN LIFE AND RADIOACTIVE NUCLEI IS STRAIGHTFORWARD NO LIFE WITHOUT TECTONIC ACTIVITY WITHOUT VOLCANIC ACTIVITY
GarikIsraelian_2009G AND WE KNOW VERY WELL THAT GEOTHERMAL ENERGY IS MOSTLY PRODUCED BY DECAY OF URANIUM THORIUM AND POTASSIUM
GarikIsraelian_2009G HOW TO MEASURE IF WE HAVE PLANETS WHERE THE AMOUNT OF THOSE ELEMENTS IS SMALL SO THOSE PLANETS ARE TECTONICALLY DEAD THERE CAN NOT BE LIFE
GarikIsraelian_2009G IF THERE IS TOO MUCH URANIUM OR POTASSIUM OR THORIUM PROBABLY AGAIN THERE WOULD BE NO LIFE BECAUSE CAN YOU IMAGINE EVERYTHING BOILING IT'S TOO MUCH ENERGY ON A PLANET
GarikIsraelian_2009G NOW WE HAVE BEEN MEASURING ABUNDANCY OF OR THORIUM IN ONE OF THE STARS WITH EXTRASOLAR PLANETS IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME GAME A VERY TINY
GarikIsraelian_2009G WE ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO MEASURE THIS PROFILE AND TO DETECT THORIUM IT'S VERY TOUGH IT'S VERY TOUGH AND YOU HAVE TO FIRST YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE YOURSELF
GarikIsraelian_2009G THEN YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE YOUR COLLEAGUES AND THEN YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE THE WHOLE WORLD THAT YOU HAVE ACTUALLY DETECTED SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF AN EXTRASOLAR PLANET HOST STAR
GarikIsraelian_2009G ONE HUNDRED PARSEC AWAY FROM HERE IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT BUT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT A LIFE
GarikIsraelian_2009G ON EXTRASOLAR PLANETS YOU HAVE TO DO THIS JOB BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF RADIOACTIVE ELEMENT YOU HAVE IN THOSE SYSTEMS
GarikIsraelian_2009G THE ONE WAY TO DISCOVER ABOUT ALIENS IS TO TUNE YOUR RADIO TELESCOPE AND LISTEN TO THE SIGNALS IF YOU RECEIVE SOMETHING INTERESTING WELL THAT'S WHAT SETI DOES ACTUALLY WHAT SETI HAS BEEN DOING FOR MANY YEARS
GarikIsraelian_2009G I THINK THE MOST PROMISING WAY IS TO GO FOR BIOMARKERS YOU CAN SEE THE SPECTRUM OF THE EARTH THIS EARTHSHINE SPECTRUM
GarikIsraelian_2009G AND THAT IS A VERY CLEAR SIGNAL THE SLOPE WHICH IS COMING WHICH WE CALL A RED EDGE IS A DETECTION OF VEGETATED AREA
GarikIsraelian_2009G IT'S AMAZING THAT WE CAN DETECT VEGETATION FROM A SPECTRUM NOW IMAGINE DOING THIS TEST FOR OTHER PLANETS
GarikIsraelian_2009G VERY RECENTLY VERY RECENTLY I'M TALKING ABOUT LAST SIX SEVEN EIGHT MONTHS WATER
GarikIsraelian_2009G CARBON DIOXIDE HAVE BEEN DETECTED IN THE SPECTRUM OF A PLANET OUTSIDE THE SOLAR SYSTEM IT'S AMAZING SO THIS IS THE POWER OF SPECTROSCOPY
GarikIsraelian_2009G YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO AND DETECT AND STUDY A CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF PLANETS FAR FAR
GarikIsraelian_2009G FAR FROM SOLAR SYSTEM WE HAVE TO DETECT OXYGEN OR OZONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ALL NECESSARY CONDITIONS TO HAVE LIFE
GarikIsraelian_2009G SOMETHING WHICH CAN BE RELATED TO SETI NOW IMAGINE AN OBJECT AMAZING OBJECT OR SOMETHING WHICH WE CAN NOT EXPLAIN WHEN WE JUST STAND UP AND SAY LOOK WE GIVE UP
GarikIsraelian_2009G AND WITH THE KNOWN PHYSICS ETC IT'S SOMETHING ACTUALLY WHICH HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY FRANK DOCTORAKE MANY YEARS AGO IF YOU SEE IN THE SPECTRUM OF A PLANET HOST STAR IF YOU SEE STRANGE CHEMICAL ELEMENTS
GarikIsraelian_2009G IT CAN BE A SIGNAL FROM A CIVILIZATION WHICH IS THERE AND THEY WANT TO SIGNAL ABOUT IT THEY WANT TO ACTUALLY SIGNAL THEIR PRESENCE THROUGH THESE SPECTRAL LINES IN THE SPECTRUM OF A STAR
GarikIsraelian_2009G IN DIFFERENT WAYS THERE CAN BE DIFFERENT WAYS DOING THIS ONE IS FOR INSTANCE TECHNETIUM IS A RADIOACTIVE ELEMENT WITH A DECAY TIME OF ABOUT FOUR POINT TWO MILLION YEARS
GarikIsraelian_2009G SUDDENLY OBSERVE TECHNETIUM IN A SUN LIKE STAR YOU CAN BE SURE THAT SOMEBODY HAS PUT THIS ELEMENT IN THE ATMOSPHERE BECAUSE IN A NATURAL WAY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THIS
GarikIsraelian_2009G NOW WE ARE REVIEWING THE SPECTRA OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED STARS WITH EXTRASOLAR PLANETS AND WE ARE DOING THIS JOB SINCE TWO THOUSAND
GarikIsraelian_2009G AND IT'S A VERY HEAVY PROJECT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD AND WE HAVE SOME INTERESTING CASES
GarikIsraelian_2009G THINGS WHICH WE CAN'T REALLY EXPLAIN AND I HOPE IN THE NEAR FUTURE WE CAN CONFIRM THIS
GarikIsraelian_2009G SO THE MAIN QUESTION ARE WE ALONE I THINK IT WILL NOT COME FROM UFOS IT WILL NOT COME FROM RADIO SIGNALS
GarikIsraelian_2009G I THINK IT WILL COME FROM A SPECTRUM LIKE THIS IT IS THE SPECTRUM OF A PLANET LIKE
GarikIsraelian_2009G SHOWING A PRESENCE OF NITROGEN OXIDE AS A CLEAR SIGNAL OF LIFE AND OXYGEN AND OZONE IF ONE DAY AND I THINK IT WILL BE WITHIN FIFTEEN YEARS FROM NOW OR TWENTY YEARS
GarikIsraelian_2009G WILL TAKE ABOUT FIVE YEARS AND THEN WE WILL NEED ANOTHER TEN FIFTEEN YEARS WITH SPACE PROJECTS TO GET THE SPECTRA OF EARTH LIKE PLANETS LIKE THE ONE I SHOWED YOU
GarikIsraelian_2009G AND IF WE SEE THE NITROGEN OXIDE AND OXYGEN I THINK WE HAVE THE PERFECT E T THANK YOU VERY MUCH
