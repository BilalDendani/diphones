JulieBurstein_2012@15.95:19.26 A SMALL CLAY POT THAT I MADE IN COLLEGE
JulieBurstein_2012@22.33:26.03 THAT BEGAN IN JAPAN CENTURIES AGO AS A WAY
JulieBurstein_2012@30.2:33.13 THIS ONE IS MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OLD
JulieBurstein_2012@33.49:37.68 EACH ONE WAS PINCHED OR CARVED OUT OF A BALL OF CLAY
JulieBurstein_2012@38.18:41.72 AND IT WAS THE IMPERFECTIONS THAT PEOPLE CHERISHED
JulieBurstein_2012@43.34:45.36 EVERYDAY POTS LIKE THIS

JulieBurstein_2012@59.46:61.56 YOU DO IT OUTSIDE AND YOU TAKE
JulieBurstein_2012@67.43:76.74 AND AS SOON AS YOU SEE THAT THE GLAZE HAS MELTED INSIDE YOU CAN SEE THAT FAINT SHEEN YOU TURN THE KILN OFF AND YOU REACH IN WITH THESE LONG METAL TONGS
JulieBurstein_2012@89.37:94.23 BUT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES WE RAMP UP THE DRAMA A LITTLE BIT AND WE DROP
JulieBurstein_2012@108.55:111.59 I LOVE RAKU BECAUSE IT ALLOWS
JulieBurstein_2012@117:118.7 AND CHOOSE A GLAZE
JulieBurstein_2012@130.99:134.57 TO ROOM TEMPERATURE IN THE SPACE OF JUST A MINUTE
JulieBurstein_2012@138.63:149.64 FOR THE PROCESS OF CREATIVITY I FIND IN SO MANY THINGS THAT TENSION BETWEEN WHAT I CAN CONTROL AND WHAT I HAVE TO LET GO HAPPENS ALL THE TIME
JulieBurstein_2012@149.74:152.74 WHETHER I 'M CREATING A NEW RADIO SHOW
JulieBurstein_2012@157.45:159.57 WHEN I SAT DOWN TO WRITE A BOOK
JulieBurstein_2012@159.57:166.28 ABOUT CREATIVITY I REALIZED THAT THE STEPS WERE REVERSED I HAD TO LET GO AT THE VERY BEGINNING
JulieBurstein_2012@169.11:171.65 IN THE STORIES OF HUNDREDS OF
JulieBurstein_2012@175.44:177.97 AND AS I LISTENED TO THESE STORIES
JulieBurstein_2012@184.97:186.65 MORE OFTEN THAN YOU MIGHT THINK
JulieBurstein_2012@204.68:206.65 THE BEST WAY TO LEARN ABOUT ANYTHING
JulieBurstein_2012@222.81:226.47 THE FIRST EMBRACE IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK OH THIS IS VERY EASY
JulieBurstein_2012@234.83:243.78 SPEAK ABOUT NEEDING TO BE OPEN TO EMBRACE EXPERIENCE AND THAT 'S HARD TO DO WHEN YOU HAVE A LIGHTED RECTANGLE IN YOUR POCKET
JulieBurstein_2012@248.54:254.3 THE FILMMAKER MIRA NAIR SPEAKS ABOUT GROWING UP IN A SMALL TOWN IN INDIA

JulieBurstein_2012@263.79:277.02 WE PLAYED CRICKET ALL THE TIME WE KIND OF GREW UP IN THE RUBBLE THE MAJOR THING THAT INSPIRED ME THAT LED ME ON THIS PATH THAT MADE ME A FILMMAKER EVENTUALLY WAS TRAVELING FOLK THEATER THAT WOULD COME THROUGH THE TOWN
JulieBurstein_2012@277.02:285.39 AND I WOULD GO OFF AND SEE THESE GREAT BATTLES OF GOOD AND EVIL BY TWO PEOPLE IN A SCHOOL FIELD WITH NO PROPS BUT WITH A LOT OF
JulieBurstein_2012@285.39:304.33 YOU KNOW PASSION AND HASHISH AS WELL AND IT WAS AMAZING YOU KNOW THE FOLK TALES OF MAHABHARATA AND RAMAYANA THE TWO HOLY BOOKS THE EPICS THAT EVERYTHING COMES OUT OF IN INDIA THEY SAY AFTER SEEING THAT JATRA THE FOLK THEATER I KNEW I WANTED TO GET ON YOU KNOW AND PERFORM

JulieBurstein_2012@358.27:360.32 HE 'S SEVERELY DYSLEXIC
JulieBurstein_2012@367.66:384.86 AND STILL TO THIS DAY CAN 'T READ SILENTLY MUCH FASTER THAN I CAN READ ALOUD BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF BENEFITS TO BEING DYSLEXIC FOR ME BECAUSE WHEN I FINALLY DID RECONCILE MYSELF TO HOW SLOW I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT THEN I THINK I CAME VERY SLOWLY
JulieBurstein_2012@384.86:403.08 INTO AN APPRECIATION OF ALL OF THOSE QUALITIES OF LANGUAGE AND OF SENTENCES THAT ARE NOT JUST THE COGNITIVE ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE THE SYNCOPATIONS THE SOUNDS OF WORDS WHAT WORDS LOOK LIKE WHERE PARAGRAPHS BREAK WHERE LINES BREAK I MEAN I WASN 'T SO BADLY DYSLEXIC THAT I WAS DISABLED FROM READING I JUST HAD TO DO IT REALLY SLOWLY
JulieBurstein_2012@403.08:408.12 AND AS I DID LINGERING ON THOSE SENTENCES AS I HAD TO LINGER
JulieBurstein_2012@408.26:414.2 I FELL HEIR TO LANGUAGE 'S OTHER QUALITIES WHICH I THINK HAS HELPED ME WRITE SENTENCES
JulieBurstein_2012@428.04:429.9 OVERCOME DYSLEXIA
JulieBurstein_2012@431.81:435.44 HE HAD TO LEARN FROM IT HE HAD TO LEARN TO HEAR THE MUSIC IN LANGUAGE

JulieBurstein_2012@476.75:480.77 AND IT 'S THE PICTURE OF A LITTLE PRINCESS AND HER LADIES IN WAITING
JulieBurstein_2012@481.04:485.52 AND IF YOU LOOK OVER THAT LITTLE BLONDE PRINCESS 'S SHOULDER YOU 'LL SEE A MIRROR
JulieBurstein_2012@486.04:487.7 AND REFLECTED IN IT
JulieBurstein_2012@487.84:489.91 THE KING AND QUEEN OF SPAIN
JulieBurstein_2012@490.38:493.84 WHO WOULD BE STANDING WHERE YOU MIGHT STAND TO LOOK AT THE PICTURE
JulieBurstein_2012@497.66:499.41 IN THIS PAINTING TOO
JulieBurstein_2012@499.56:501.09 HE 'S STANDING ON THE LEFT
JulieBurstein_2012@524.21:529.99 RANDOMNESS AND I WASN 'T GETTING ANYWHERE SO I WENT BACK AND DUMPED ALL MY PAINTINGS IN THE ARNO AND I THOUGHT I 'M GOING TO JUST START PLAYING AROUND

JulieBurstein_2012@561.44:564.79 TO ROLL TO CREASE TO FOLD
JulieBurstein_2012@575.28:577.32 HE WOULD DO THE SAME THING
JulieBurstein_2012@578.15:580.39 AND WHEN HE GOT TO THE DIRECTION
JulieBurstein_2012@586.77:589.61 RICHARD SERRA HAD TO LET GO OF PAINTING
JulieBurstein_2012@589.67:593.05 IN ORDER TO EMBARK ON THIS PLAYFUL EXPLORATION
JulieBurstein_2012@593.46:596.24 THAT LED HIM TO THE WORK THAT HE 'S KNOWN FOR TODAY
JulieBurstein_2012@614.07:617.56 SO EXPERIENCE AND CHALLENGE
JulieBurstein_2012@617.95:623.15 AND LIMITATIONS ARE ALL THINGS WE NEED TO EMBRACE FOR CREATIVITY TO FLOURISH
JulieBurstein_2012@623.7:625.23 THERE 'S A FOURTH EMBRACE
JulieBurstein_2012@626.28:629.36 AND IT 'S THE HARDEST IT 'S THE EMBRACE OF LOSS
JulieBurstein_2012@629.85:633.66 THE OLDEST AND MOST CONSTANT OF HUMAN EXPERIENCES
JulieBurstein_2012@633.87:640.01 IN ORDER TO CREATE WE HAVE TO STAND IN THAT SPACE BETWEEN WHAT WE SEE IN THE WORLD AND WHAT WE HOPE FOR
JulieBurstein_2012@640.88:643.46 LOOKING SQUARELY AT REJECTION
JulieBurstein_2012@651.99:655.16 EDUCATOR PARKER PALMER CALLS IT THE TRAGIC
JulieBurstein_2012@659.98:665.89 AND MY FRIEND DICK NODEL LIKES TO SAY YOU CAN HOLD THAT TENSION LIKE A VIOLIN STRING
JulieBurstein_2012@666.27:668.2 AND MAKE SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL
JulieBurstein_2012@674.04:684.97 WHO AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER WAS KNOWN FOR HIS STREET PHOTOGRAPHY FOR CAPTURING A MOMENT ON THE STREET AND ALSO FOR HIS BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPHS OF LANDSCAPES OF TUSCANY
JulieBurstein_2012@693.72:697.82 WITH A STRAIGHT VIEW DOWNTOWN TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
JulieBurstein_2012@698.1:701.97 AND HE PHOTOGRAPHED THOSE BUILDINGS IN EVERY SORT OF LIGHT
JulieBurstein_2012@703.71:705.28 YOU KNOW WHERE THIS STORY
JulieBurstein_2012@725.27:730.83 AND I RAISED MY CAMERA TO TAKE A PEEK JUST TO SEE IF THERE WAS SOMETHING TO SEE AND SOME
JulieBurstein_2012@744.1:751.79 AND WHEN I ASKED HER WHY NO PICTURES SHE SAID IT 'S A CRIME SCENE NO PHOTOGRAPHS ALLOWED AND I ASKED HER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I WAS A MEMBER OF THE PRESS
JulieBurstein_2012@751.79:758.48 AND SHE TOLD ME OH LOOK BACK THERE AND BACK A BLOCK WAS THE PRESS CORPS TIED UP
JulieBurstein_2012@758.64:760.88 IN A LITTLE PENNED IN AREA
JulieBurstein_2012@761.16:764.69 AND I SAID WELL WHEN DO THEY GO IN AND SHE SAID PROBABLY NEVER
JulieBurstein_2012@765.06:769.06 AND AS I WALKED AWAY FROM THAT I HAD THIS CRYSTALLIZATION
JulieBurstein_2012@769.2:772.91 PROBABLY FROM THE BLOW BECAUSE IT WAS AN INSULT IN A WAY I THOUGHT
JulieBurstein_2012@776.35:784.64 WE NEED A RECORD AND I THOUGHT I 'M GONNA MAKE THAT RECORD I 'LL FIND A WAY TO GET IN BECAUSE I DON 'T WANT TO SEE THIS HISTORY DISAPPEAR
JulieBurstein_2012@791.98:794.31 FOR NINE MONTHS ALMOST EVERY DAY
JulieBurstein_2012@795.12:802.78 LOOKING AT THESE PHOTOGRAPHS TODAY BRINGS BACK THE SMELL OF SMOKE THAT LINGERED ON MY CLOTHES WHEN I WENT HOME TO MY FAMILY AT NIGHT
JulieBurstein_2012@802.91:805.13 MY OFFICE WAS JUST A FEW BLOCKS AWAY
JulieBurstein_2012@809.94:814.74 AND WE WONDERED WAS IT DIFFICULT FOR JOEL MEYEROWITZ TO MAKE SUCH BEAUTY
JulieBurstein_2012@815.18:816.84 OUT OF SUCH DEVASTATION
JulieBurstein_2012@830.41:843.31 AFTER THE FACT INTO THIS RESIDUE AND LIKE MANY OTHER RUINS YOU GO TO THE RUINS OF THE COLOSSEUM OR THE RUINS OF A CATHEDRAL SOMEPLACE AND THEY TAKE ON A NEW MEANING WHEN YOU WATCH THE WEATHER
JulieBurstein_2012@843.63:853.02 I MEAN THERE WERE AFTERNOONS I WAS DOWN THERE AND THE LIGHT GOES PINK AND THERE 'S A MIST IN THE AIR AND YOU 'RE STANDING IN THE RUBBLE AND I FOUND MYSELF
JulieBurstein_2012@853.08:854.8 RECOGNIZING BOTH
JulieBurstein_2012@855.58:861.41 THE INHERENT BEAUTY OF NATURE AND THE FACT THAT NATURE AS TIME IS ERASING
JulieBurstein_2012@861.41:863.74 THIS WOUND
JulieBurstein_2012@863.74:872.09 TIME IS UNSTOPPABLE AND IT TRANSFORMS THE EVENT IT GETS FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THE DAY AND LIGHT AND SEASONS
JulieBurstein_2012@907.73:910.17 YOU HAVE TO TAKE A PICTURE
JulieBurstein_2012@919.3:928.74 WHEN I SAW JOEL MEYEROWITZ RECENTLY I TOLD HIM HOW MUCH I ADMIRED HIS PASSIONATE OBSTINACY HIS DETERMINATION TO PUSH THROUGH ALL THE BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE
JulieBurstein_2012@954.42:960.92 HE 'S RIGHT WE ALL WRESTLE WITH EXPERIENCE AND CHALLENGE LIMITS AND LOSS
JulieBurstein_2012@961.54:963.66 CREATIVITY IS ESSENTIAL TO ALL OF US
JulieBurstein_2012@964.06:966.57 WHETHER WE 'RE SCIENTISTS OR TEACHERS
JulieBurstein_2012@972.95:978.72 IMAGE OF A JAPANESE TEA BOWL THIS ONE IS AT THE FREER GALLERY IN WASHINGTON D C
JulieBurstein_2012@978.83:984.06 IT 'S MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND YOU CAN STILL SEE THE FINGERMARKS WHERE THE POTTER PINCHED IT
JulieBurstein_2012@985.23:990.39 BUT AS YOU CAN ALSO SEE THIS ONE DID BREAK AT SOME POINT IN ITS HUNDRED YEARS
JulieBurstein_2012@997.96:1000.94 USING GOLD LACQUER TO REPAIR IT
JulieBurstein_2012@1001.6:1004.23 THIS BOWL IS MORE BEAUTIFUL NOW
JulieBurstein_2012@1004.81:1008.69 HAVING BEEN BROKEN THAN IT WAS WHEN IT WAS FIRST MADE
JulieBurstein_2012@1013.94:1017.05 OF THE CYCLE OF CREATION AND DESTRUCTION
JulieBurstein_2012@1017.65:1020.06 OF CONTROL AND LETTING GO
JulieBurstein_2012@1020.48:1024.09 OF PICKING UP THE PIECES AND MAKING SOMETHING NEW
