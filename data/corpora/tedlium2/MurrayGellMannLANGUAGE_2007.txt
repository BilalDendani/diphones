MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007@13.22:22.74 WELL I'M INVOLVED IN OTHER THINGS BESIDES PHYSICS IN FACT MOSTLY NOW IN OTHER THINGS ONE THING IS DISTANT RELATIONSHIPS AMONG HUMAN LANGUAGES

MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007@29.58:32.99 MOSTLY TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM ANY LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS

MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007@93.86:106.21 THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO OR EARLIER I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DID ALL THOSE THINGS AND DIDN'T ALSO HAVE A MODERN LANGUAGE SO I WOULD GUESS THAT THE ACTUAL ORIGIN GOES BACK AT LEAST THAT FAR AND MAYBE FURTHER BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007@106.55:118.48 THAT ALL OR MANY OR MOST OF TODAY 'S ATTESTED LANGUAGES COULDN'T DESCEND PERHAPS FROM ONE THAT'S MUCH YOUNGER THAN THAT LIKE SAY TWENTY THOUSAND YEARS OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND IT'S WHAT WE CALL A BOTTLENECK
