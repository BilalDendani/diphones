JohnMaeda_2007@372.30:384.06 BECAUSE THE HUMAN THING IS VERY HARD WHEN YOU'RE AT MIT THE T DOESN'T STAND FOR HUMAN IT STANDS FOR TECHNOLOGY AND BECAUSE OF THAT I ALWAYS WONDERED ABOUT THIS HUMAN THING SO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN GOOGLING THIS WORD HUMAN TO FIND OUT HOW MANY HITS I GET
JohnMaeda_2007@384.29:394.61 IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE I HAD TWENTY SIX MILLION HITS AND FOR A COMPUTER BECAUSE COMPUTERS ARE AGAINST HUMANS A BIT I HAVE FORTY TWO MILLION HITS LET ME DO AN AL GORE HERE SO IF YOU SORT OF COMPARE THAT
JohnMaeda_2007@409.44:421.70 IN THE SIMPLICITY REALM IT'S ALSO INTERESTING SO IF YOU COMPARE COMPLEXITIES TO SIMPLICITY IT'S ALSO CATCHING UP IN A WAY TOO SO SOMEHOW HUMANS AND SIMPLICITY ARE INTERTWINED I THINK
JohnMaeda_2007@423.69:431.96 I HAVE A CONFESSION I'M NOT A MAN OF SIMPLICITY I SPENT MY ENTIRE EARLY CAREER MAKING COMPLEX STUFF LOTS OF COMPLEX STUFF I
JohnMaeda_2007@432.27:443.19 WROTE COMPUTER PROGRAMS TO MAKE COMPLEX GRAPHICS LIKE THIS I HAD CLIENTS IN JAPAN TO MAKE REALLY COMPLEX STUFF LIKE THIS AND I'VE ALWAYS FELT BAD ABOUT IT IN A SENSE SO I HID IN A TIME DIMENSION
JohnMaeda_2007@453.05:465.98 AND THIS IS A FIREWORK CALENDAR SO YOU LAUNCH THE NUMBER INTO SPACE BECAUSE THE JAPANESE BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU SEE FIREWORKS YOU'RE COOLER FOR SOME REASON THIS IS WHY THEY HAVE FIREWORKS IN THE SUMMER A VERY EXTREME CULTURE
JohnMaeda_2007@467.26:476.52 THIS IS A FALL BASED CALENDAR BECAUSE I HAVE SO MANY LEAVES IN MY YARD SO THIS IS THE LEAVES IN MY YARD ESSENTIALLY AND SO I MADE A LOT OF THESE TYPES OF THINGS

JohnMaeda_2007@529.93:541.20 MAKE ART WITH A COMPUTER PROGRAM YOU'RE ALWAYS ON THE TREE AND THE PARADOX IS THAT FOR EXCELLENT ART YOU WANT TO BE OFF THE TREE SO THIS IS SORT OF A COMPLICATION I'VE FOUND

JohnMaeda_2007@553.83:564.67 YOU CAN'T TYPE VERY MUCH ON THIS I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT AN IR MOUSE RESPONDS TO CRT EMISSIONS AND STARTS TO MOVE BY ITSELF SO THIS IS A SELF DRAWING MACHINE
JohnMaeda_2007@578.18:583.00 MEASURE THE IMPACT STUFF LIKE THIS ARE THINGS I MADE JUST TO SORT OF UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE THINGS ARE
JohnMaeda_2007@609.64:616.21 IN DIFFERENT FORMS IF YOU DRY THEM QUICK YOU CAN MAKE LIKE ELEPHANTS AND STEERS AND STUFF AND MY WIFE DIDN'T LIKE THESE BECAUSE THEY MOLD SO I HAD TO STOP THAT
JohnMaeda_2007@617.02:621.20 SO I WENT BACK TO THE COMPUTER AND I BOUGHT FIVE LARGE FRIES AND SCANNED THEM ALL
JohnMaeda_2007@621.97:629.99 AND I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF FOOD THEME AND I WROTE SOME SOFTWARE TO AUTOMATICALLY LAY OUT FRENCH FRY IMAGES

JohnMaeda_2007@657.79:658.54 I DISCOVERED THAT
JohnMaeda_2007@658.90:660.97 CHEETOS ARE GOOD EXPRESSIVE MATERIAL
JohnMaeda_2007@661.64:675.59 AND WITH THESE CHEETOS I BEGAN TO THINK WHAT CAN I MAKE WITH THESE CHEETOS AND SO I BEGAN TO CRINKLE UP POTATO CHIP FLECKS AND ALSO PRETZELS I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF FORM AND IN THE END I MADE ONE HUNDRED BUTTER FRIES
JohnMaeda_2007@677.34:677.68 AND
JohnMaeda_2007@677.99:690.09 EACH BUTTER FRY IS COMPOSED OF DIFFERENT PIECES PEOPLE ASK ME HOW THEY MAKE THE ANTENNA SOMETIMES THEY FIND A HAIR IN THE FOOD THAT'S MY HAIR MY HAIR 'S CLEAN IT'S OKAY I'M A TENURED PROFESSOR WHICH MEANS BASICALLY I DON'T HAVE TO WORK ANYMORE
JohnMaeda_2007@690.53:698.47 A STRANGE BUSINESS MODEL I CAN COME INTO WORK EVERYDAY AND STAPLE FIVE PIECES OF PAPER AND JUST STARE AT IT WITH MY LATTE END OF STORY BUT
JohnMaeda_2007@699.17:713.23 I REALIZED THAT LIFE COULD BE VERY BORING SO I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT LIFE AND I NOTICE THAT MY CAMERA MY DIGITAL CAMERA VERSUS MY CAR A VERY STRANGE THING THE CAR IS SO BIG THE CAMERA IS SO SMALL YET THE MANUAL FOR THE CAMERA IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN THE
JohnMaeda_2007@718.72:725.45 SO I WAS IN THE CAPE ONE TIME AND I TYPED THE WORD SIMPLICITY AND I DISCOVERED IN THIS WEIRD M NIGHT SHYAMALAN WAY THAT I DISCOVERED
JohnMaeda_2007@748.92:760.22 BUT THE LAWS ARE KIND OF LIKE SUSHI IN A WAY THERE ARE ALL KINDS IN JAPAN THEY SAY THAT SUSHI IS CHALLENGING YOU KNOW THE UNI IS THE MOST CHALLENGING SO NUMBER TEN IS CHALLENGING PEOPLE HATE NUMBER TEN LIKE THEY HATE UNI ACTUALLY
JohnMaeda_2007@760.39:768.63 THE THREE KEYS ARE EASY TO EAT SO THIS IS ANAGO COOKED ALREADY SO EASY TO EAT SO ENJOY YOUR SUSHI MEAL LATER WITH THE LAWS OF SIMPLICITY
JohnMaeda_2007@777.53:785.13 COOKIE VERSUS LAUNDRY THING ANYONE WHO HAS KIDS KNOWS THAT IF YOU OFFER A KID A BIG COOKIE OR A SMALL COOKIE WHICH COOKIE ARE THEY GOING TO TAKE
JohnMaeda_2007@785.86:794.98 BIG COOKIE YOU CAN SAY THE SMALL COOKIE HAS GODIVA CHOCOLATE BITS IN IT BUT IT DOESN'T WORK THEY WANT THE BIG COOKIE BUT IF YOU OFFER KIDS TWO PILES OF
JohnMaeda_2007@795.27:801.31 TO FOLD THE SMALL PILE OR THE BIG PILE WHICH WILL THEY CHOOSE STRANGELY NOT THE BIG PILE
JohnMaeda_2007@802.60:811.81 SO I THINK IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THIS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WANT MORE IT'S BECAUSE YOU WANT TO ENJOY IT WHEN YOU WANT LESS IT'S BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT WORK AND SO TO BOIL IT ALL DOWN

JohnMaeda_2007@915.29:924.53 YOUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IS VERY INTERESTING SO AS YOU GET OLDER YOU MAY LIKE HAVE KIDS WHATEVER AND THEN THE KIDS GRADUATE AND YOU HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY ANY MORE
