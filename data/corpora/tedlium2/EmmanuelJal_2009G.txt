EmmanuelJal_2009G@13.53:21.46 SAY MY NAME IS EMMANUEL JAL AND I COME FROM A LONG WAY I'VE BEEN TELLING A STORY THAT HAS BEEN
EmmanuelJal_2009G@22.01:28.85 SO PAINFUL FOR ME IT'S BEEN A TOUGH JOURNEY FOR ME TRAVELING THE WORLD TELLING MY STORY IN FORM OF A
EmmanuelJal_2009G@28.96:41.82 BOOK AND ALSO TELLING IT LIKE NOW AND ALSO THE EASIEST ONE WAS WHEN I WAS DOING IT IN FORM OF A MUSIC SO I HAVE BRANDED MYSELF AS A WAR CHILD
EmmanuelJal_2009G@45.04:48.03 DOING THIS BECAUSE OF
EmmanuelJal_2009G@49.47:62.35 LADY IN MY VILLAGE NOW WHO HAVE LOST HER CHILDREN THERE IS NO NEWSPAPER TO COVER HER PAIN AND WHAT SHE WANTS TO CHANGE IN THIS SOCIETY AND I'M DOING IT FOR A YOUNG MAN
EmmanuelJal_2009G@62.97:73.90 WHO WANT TO CREATE A CHANGE AND HAS NO WAY TO PROJECT HIS VOICE BECAUSE HE CAN'T WRITE OR THERE IS NO INTERNET LIKE FACEBOOK MYSPACE YOUTUBE FOR THEM TO
EmmanuelJal_2009G@78.44:84.71 ALSO ONE THING THAT KEPT ME PUSHING THIS STORY THIS PAINFUL STORIES OUT THE DREAMS
EmmanuelJal_2009G@86.18:88.35 IS LIKE THE VOICES OF THE
EmmanuelJal_2009G@89.35:90.30 THAT I HAVE SEEN
EmmanuelJal_2009G@102.03:108.75 WELL I WAS BORN IN THE MOST DIFFICULT TIME WHEN MY COUNTRY WAS AT WAR
EmmanuelJal_2009G@135.54:141.48 SEEING PEOPLE DIE EVERY DAY MY MOTHER CRYING IT'S LIKE I WAS RAISED IN A VIOLENCE
EmmanuelJal_2009G@145.76:154.94 THAT MADE ME CALL MYSELF A WAR CHILD AND NOT ONLY THAT WHEN I WAS EIGHT I BECAME A CHILD SOLDIER
EmmanuelJal_2009G@155.87:163.59 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS THE WAR FOR BUT ONE THING I KNEW WAS AN IMAGE THAT I SAW THAT STUCK IN MY HEAD
EmmanuelJal_2009G@164.18:171.03 WHEN I WENT TO THE TRAINING CAMP I SAY I WANT TO KILL AS MANY MUSLIMS AND AS MANY ARABS AS POSSIBLE
EmmanuelJal_2009G@171.49:178.83 THE TRAINING WASN'T EASY BUT THAT WAS THE DRIVING FORCE BECAUSE I WANTED TO REVENGE FOR MY FAMILY I WANTED TO REVENGE FOR MY
EmmanuelJal_2009G@189.84:198.89 WHAT WAS ACTUALLY KILLING US WASN'T THE MUSLIMS WASN'T THE ARABS IT WAS SOMEBODY SITTING SOMEWHERE MANIPULATING THE SYSTEM
EmmanuelJal_2009G@200.35:209.88 AND USING RELIGION TO GET WHAT THEY WANT TO GET OUT OF US WHICH IS THE OIL THE DIAMOND THE GOLD AND THE LAND
EmmanuelJal_2009G@211.22:218.68 SO REALIZING THE TRUTH GIVE ME A POSITION TO CHOOSE SHOULD I CONTINUE TO HATE OR LET IT GO
EmmanuelJal_2009G@219.30:227.73 SO I HAPPENED TO FORGIVE NOW I SING MUSIC WITH THE MUSLIMS I DANCE WITH THEM I EVEN HAD A MOVIE OUT CALLED WAR CHILD FUNDED BY
