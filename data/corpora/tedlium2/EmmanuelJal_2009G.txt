EmmanuelJal_2009G SAY MY NAME IS EMMANUEL JAL AND I COME FROM A LONG WAY I'VE BEEN TELLING A STORY THAT HAS BEEN
EmmanuelJal_2009G SO PAINFUL FOR ME IT'S BEEN A TOUGH JOURNEY FOR ME TRAVELING THE WORLD TELLING MY STORY IN FORM OF A
EmmanuelJal_2009G BOOK AND ALSO TELLING IT LIKE NOW AND ALSO THE EASIEST ONE WAS WHEN I WAS DOING IT IN FORM OF A MUSIC SO I HAVE BRANDED MYSELF AS A WAR CHILD
EmmanuelJal_2009G DOING THIS BECAUSE OF
EmmanuelJal_2009G LADY IN MY VILLAGE NOW WHO HAVE LOST HER CHILDREN THERE IS NO NEWSPAPER TO COVER HER PAIN AND WHAT SHE WANTS TO CHANGE IN THIS SOCIETY AND I'M DOING IT FOR A YOUNG MAN
EmmanuelJal_2009G WHO WANT TO CREATE A CHANGE AND HAS NO WAY TO PROJECT HIS VOICE BECAUSE HE CAN'T WRITE OR THERE IS NO INTERNET LIKE FACEBOOK MYSPACE YOUTUBE FOR THEM TO
EmmanuelJal_2009G ALSO ONE THING THAT KEPT ME PUSHING THIS STORY THIS PAINFUL STORIES OUT THE DREAMS
EmmanuelJal_2009G IS LIKE THE VOICES OF THE
EmmanuelJal_2009G THAT I HAVE SEEN
EmmanuelJal_2009G WELL I WAS BORN IN THE MOST DIFFICULT TIME WHEN MY COUNTRY WAS AT WAR
EmmanuelJal_2009G SEEING PEOPLE DIE EVERY DAY MY MOTHER CRYING IT'S LIKE I WAS RAISED IN A VIOLENCE
EmmanuelJal_2009G THAT MADE ME CALL MYSELF A WAR CHILD AND NOT ONLY THAT WHEN I WAS EIGHT I BECAME A CHILD SOLDIER
EmmanuelJal_2009G I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS THE WAR FOR BUT ONE THING I KNEW WAS AN IMAGE THAT I SAW THAT STUCK IN MY HEAD
EmmanuelJal_2009G WHEN I WENT TO THE TRAINING CAMP I SAY I WANT TO KILL AS MANY MUSLIMS AND AS MANY ARABS AS POSSIBLE
EmmanuelJal_2009G THE TRAINING WASN'T EASY BUT THAT WAS THE DRIVING FORCE BECAUSE I WANTED TO REVENGE FOR MY FAMILY I WANTED TO REVENGE FOR MY
EmmanuelJal_2009G WHAT WAS ACTUALLY KILLING US WASN'T THE MUSLIMS WASN'T THE ARABS IT WAS SOMEBODY SITTING SOMEWHERE MANIPULATING THE SYSTEM
EmmanuelJal_2009G AND USING RELIGION TO GET WHAT THEY WANT TO GET OUT OF US WHICH IS THE OIL THE DIAMOND THE GOLD AND THE LAND
EmmanuelJal_2009G SO REALIZING THE TRUTH GIVE ME A POSITION TO CHOOSE SHOULD I CONTINUE TO HATE OR LET IT GO
EmmanuelJal_2009G SO I HAPPENED TO FORGIVE NOW I SING MUSIC WITH THE MUSLIMS I DANCE WITH THEM I EVEN HAD A MOVIE OUT CALLED WAR CHILD FUNDED BY
EmmanuelJal_2009G SO
EmmanuelJal_2009G THAT PAIN HAS GONE OUT BUT MY STORY IS HUGE SO I'M JUST GOING TO GO INTO A DIFFERENT STEP NOW WHICH IS EASIER FOR ME I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
EmmanuelJal_2009G TO SIN WHICH IS FROM MY ALBUM WAR CHILD I TALK ABOUT MY STORY ONE OF THE JOURNEY THAT I TREAD WHEN I WAS TEMPTED TO EAT

EmmanuelJal_2009G QUESTION WHAT AM I HERE FOR AND WHY ARE MY PEOPLE POOR AND WHY WHY WHEN THE REST OF THE CHILDREN WERE LEARNING HOW TO READ AND WRITE I WAS LEARNING HOW TO FIGHT
EmmanuelJal_2009G WHAT ENERGIZED ME AND KEPT ME GOING IS THE MUSIC I DO I NEVER SAW ANYBODY TO TELL MY STORY TO THEM SO THEY COULD ADVISE ME OR DO THERAPY SO THE MUSIC
EmmanuelJal_2009G BEEN MY THERAPY FOR ME IT'S BEEN WHERE I ACTUALLY SEE HEAVEN WHERE I CAN BE HAPPY WHERE I CAN BE A CHILD AGAIN IN DANCES THROUGH MUSIC
