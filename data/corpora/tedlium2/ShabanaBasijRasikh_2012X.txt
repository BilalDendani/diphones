ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X I REMEMBER WAKING UP ONE MORNING TO THE SOUND OF JOY IN MY HOUSE
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X MY FATHER WAS LISTENING TO BBC NEWS ON HIS SMALL GRAY RADIO
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X THERE WAS A BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE WHICH WAS UNUSUAL THEN BECAUSE THE NEWS MOSTLY DEPRESSED HIM
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X THE TALIBAN ARE GONE
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X BUT I COULD SEE THAT MY FATHER WAS VERY VERY HAPPY
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X YOU CAN GO TO A REAL SCHOOL NOW
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X TO A SECRET SCHOOL
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X IT WAS THE ONLY WAY WE BOTH COULD BE EDUCATED
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X EACH DAY WE TOOK A DIFFERENT ROUTE
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X SO THAT NO ONE WOULD SUSPECT WHERE WE WERE GOING
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X WE WOULD COVER OUR BOOKS IN GROCERY BAGS SO IT WOULD SEEM WE WERE JUST OUT SHOPPING
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X THE SCHOOL WAS IN A HOUSE
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED OF US PACKED IN ONE SMALL LIVING ROOM
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X IT WAS COZY IN WINTER BUT EXTREMELY HOT
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X FROM TIME TO TIME THE SCHOOL WOULD SUDDENLY BE CANCELED FOR A WEEK BECAUSE TALIBAN WERE SUSPICIOUS
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X WE ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT THEY KNEW ABOUT US
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X I WAS VERY LUCKY TO GROW UP IN A FAMILY
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X WHERE EDUCATION WAS PRIZED
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X AND DAUGHTERS WERE TREASURED
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X MY GRANDFATHER WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN FOR HIS TIME
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X A TOTAL MAVERICK FROM A REMOTE PROVINCE OF AFGHANISTAN HE INSISTED THAT HIS DAUGHTER MY MOM
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X BUT MY EDUCATED MOTHER BECAME A TEACHER
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X RECEIVE AN EDUCATION INCLUDING HIS DAUGHTERS
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X DESPITE THE TALIBAN
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X DESPITE THE RISKS
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X THERE WERE TIMES I WOULD GET SO FRUSTRATED BY OUR LIFE
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X AND ALWAYS BEING SCARED AND NOT SEEING A FUTURE
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X I WOULD WANT TO QUIT
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X YOUR MONEY CAN BE STOLEN YOU CAN BE FORCED TO LEAVE YOUR HOME DURING A WAR BUT THE ONE THING THAT WILL ALWAYS REMAIN WITH YOU IS WHAT IS HERE
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X AND IF WE HAVE TO SELL OUR BLOOD
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X TO PAY YOUR SCHOOL FEES
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X FEWER THAN SIX PERCENT OF WOMEN MY AGE HAVE MADE IT BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X AND HAD MY FAMILY NOT BEEN SO COMMITTED TO MY EDUCATION I WOULD BE ONE OF
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X HE NOT ONLY BRAGS ABOUT MY COLLEGE DEGREE BUT ALSO THAT I WAS THE FIRST WOMAN AND
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X AND THAT I AM THE FIRST WOMAN TO DRIVE HIM THROUGH THE STREETS OF KABUL
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X MY FAMILY BELIEVES IN ME
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X THAT 'S WHY I COFOUNDED SOLA
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X WHERE IT 'S STILL RISKY FOR GIRLS TO GO TO SCHOOL
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X THE EXCITING THING IS THAT I SEE STUDENTS AT MY SCHOOL
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X WITH AMBITION GRABBING AT OPPORTUNITY
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X AND I SEE THEIR PARENTS
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X AND THEIR FATHERS WHO LIKE MY OWN
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X BUT AHMED IS THE FATHER OF ONE OF MY STUDENTS
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X LESS THAN A MONTH AGO HE
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X AND HIS DAUGHTER WERE ON THEIR WAY FROM SOLA TO THEIR VILLAGE
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X THAT IF HE SENT HIS DAUGHTER BACK TO SCHOOL
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X BUT I WILL NOT RUIN MY DAUGHTER 'S
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X FUTURE BECAUSE OF YOUR OLD AND BACKWARD IDEAS
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X WHAT I 'VE COME TO REALIZE ABOUT AFGHANISTAN
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS OFTEN DISMISSED IN THE WEST THAT BEHIND MOST OF US WHO SUCCEED
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X AND WHO SEES THAT HER SUCCESS IS HIS SUCCESS
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X IT 'S NOT TO SAY THAT OUR MOTHERS AREN 'T KEY
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X IN OUR SUCCESS IN FACT THEY 'RE OFTEN THE INITIAL AND CONVINCING NEGOTIATORS OF A BRIGHT FUTURE FOR THEIR DAUGHTERS
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF A SOCIETY LIKE IN AFGHANISTAN
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X WE MUST HAVE THE SUPPORT OF MEN
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X UNDER THE TALIBAN GIRLS WHO WENT TO SCHOOL
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X NUMBERED IN THE HUNDREDS REMEMBER IT WAS ILLEGAL
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X MUCH BEYOND THE U S TROOPS WITHDRAWAL
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X BUT WHEN I AM BACK IN AFGHANISTAN
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X AND THEIR PARENTS WHO ADVOCATE FOR THEM WHO ENCOURAGE THEM
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X TO ME AFGHANISTAN IS A COUNTRY OF HOPE AND BOUNDLESS POSSIBILITIES
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X AND EVERY SINGLE DAY
