ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@17.6:21.28 I REMEMBER WAKING UP ONE MORNING TO THE SOUND OF JOY IN MY HOUSE
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@22.12:26.96 MY FATHER WAS LISTENING TO BBC NEWS ON HIS SMALL GRAY RADIO
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@28.75:34.03 THERE WAS A BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE WHICH WAS UNUSUAL THEN BECAUSE THE NEWS MOSTLY DEPRESSED HIM
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@35.8:37.43 THE TALIBAN ARE GONE
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@43.56:46.36 BUT I COULD SEE THAT MY FATHER WAS VERY VERY HAPPY
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@49.24:51.9 YOU CAN GO TO A REAL SCHOOL NOW
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@81.1:82.65 TO A SECRET SCHOOL
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@84.85:87.62 IT WAS THE ONLY WAY WE BOTH COULD BE EDUCATED
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@89.71:92.22 EACH DAY WE TOOK A DIFFERENT ROUTE
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@92.56:95.33 SO THAT NO ONE WOULD SUSPECT WHERE WE WERE GOING
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@96.67:101.46 WE WOULD COVER OUR BOOKS IN GROCERY BAGS SO IT WOULD SEEM WE WERE JUST OUT SHOPPING
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@104.87:106.74 THE SCHOOL WAS IN A HOUSE
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@107.23:111.79 MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED OF US PACKED IN ONE SMALL LIVING ROOM
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@112.88:115.5 IT WAS COZY IN WINTER BUT EXTREMELY HOT
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@125.79:130.58 FROM TIME TO TIME THE SCHOOL WOULD SUDDENLY BE CANCELED FOR A WEEK BECAUSE TALIBAN WERE SUSPICIOUS
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@132.15:134.95 WE ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT THEY KNEW ABOUT US
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@151.89:154.72 I WAS VERY LUCKY TO GROW UP IN A FAMILY
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@155.38:157.86 WHERE EDUCATION WAS PRIZED
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@157.9:159.51 AND DAUGHTERS WERE TREASURED
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@161.44:164.4 MY GRANDFATHER WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN FOR HIS TIME
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@166.37:172.45 A TOTAL MAVERICK FROM A REMOTE PROVINCE OF AFGHANISTAN HE INSISTED THAT HIS DAUGHTER MY MOM
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@179.74:182.28 BUT MY EDUCATED MOTHER BECAME A TEACHER
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@208.41:211.65 RECEIVE AN EDUCATION INCLUDING HIS DAUGHTERS
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@212.66:214.23 DESPITE THE TALIBAN

ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@229.42:233.09 THERE WERE TIMES I WOULD GET SO FRUSTRATED BY OUR LIFE
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@233.63:237.07 AND ALWAYS BEING SCARED AND NOT SEEING A FUTURE
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@237.78:239.34 I WOULD WANT TO QUIT
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@251.62:259.88 YOUR MONEY CAN BE STOLEN YOU CAN BE FORCED TO LEAVE YOUR HOME DURING A WAR BUT THE ONE THING THAT WILL ALWAYS REMAIN WITH YOU IS WHAT IS HERE
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@262.28:264.6 AND IF WE HAVE TO SELL OUR BLOOD
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@264.67:266.58 TO PAY YOUR SCHOOL FEES
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@283.83:288.62 FEWER THAN SIX PERCENT OF WOMEN MY AGE HAVE MADE IT BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@289.45:293.12 AND HAD MY FAMILY NOT BEEN SO COMMITTED TO MY EDUCATION I WOULD BE ONE OF
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@321.35:325.59 HE NOT ONLY BRAGS ABOUT MY COLLEGE DEGREE BUT ALSO THAT I WAS THE FIRST WOMAN AND

ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@351.08:353.32 THAT 'S WHY I COFOUNDED SOLA
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@359.44:362.5 WHERE IT 'S STILL RISKY FOR GIRLS TO GO TO SCHOOL
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@363.32:367.41 THE EXCITING THING IS THAT I SEE STUDENTS AT MY SCHOOL
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@367.83:370.4 WITH AMBITION GRABBING AT OPPORTUNITY
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@372.85:374.78 AND I SEE THEIR PARENTS
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@374.82:377.36 AND THEIR FATHERS WHO LIKE MY OWN
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@394.51:397.18 BUT AHMED IS THE FATHER OF ONE OF MY STUDENTS
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@398.27:400.68 LESS THAN A MONTH AGO HE
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@400.78:404.94 AND HIS DAUGHTER WERE ON THEIR WAY FROM SOLA TO THEIR VILLAGE

ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@462.84:465.25 IT 'S NOT TO SAY THAT OUR MOTHERS AREN 'T KEY
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@465.57:473.92 IN OUR SUCCESS IN FACT THEY 'RE OFTEN THE INITIAL AND CONVINCING NEGOTIATORS OF A BRIGHT FUTURE FOR THEIR DAUGHTERS
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@474.5:477.87 BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF A SOCIETY LIKE IN AFGHANISTAN
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@477.95:480.03 WE MUST HAVE THE SUPPORT OF MEN
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X@481.69:484.99 UNDER THE TALIBAN GIRLS WHO WENT TO SCHOOL
