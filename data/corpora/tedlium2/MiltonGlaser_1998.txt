MiltonGlaser_1998 INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY BECAUSE YOU ARE ALWAYS COMPARING THE VARIATION WITH THE THEME THAT YOU HOLD IN YOUR MIND YOU MIGHT SAY THAT THE THEME IS NATURE
MiltonGlaser_1998 AND EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS IS A VARIATION ON THE SUBJECT
MiltonGlaser_1998 I
MiltonGlaser_1998 I GUESS ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO TO DO A
MiltonGlaser_1998 THAT IN SOME WAY WOULD CELEBRATE THE BIRTH OF PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA
MiltonGlaser_1998 AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO IMAGINE HOW TO
MiltonGlaser_1998 PICTURES THAT WERE BASED ON
MiltonGlaser_1998 UNTIL I REALIZED THAT I COULD LOOK AT PIERO AS NATURE
MiltonGlaser_1998 THAT I WOULD HAVE THE SAME
MiltonGlaser_1998 ATTITUDE TOWARDS LOOKING
MiltonGlaser_1998 AT PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA AS I WOULD IF I WERE LOOKING OUT A
MiltonGlaser_1998 AND THAT WAS ENORMOUSLY LIBERATING TO ME AND PERHAPS IT'S NOT A VERY INSIGHTFUL OBSERVATION BUT
MiltonGlaser_1998 THAT REALLY STARTED ME ON A PATH TO BE ABLE TO DO A KIND OF THEME AND VARIATION BASED ON A WORK BY PIERO IN THIS CASE THAT REMARKABLE
MiltonGlaser_1998 THE REAL PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA
MiltonGlaser_1998 ONE OF THE GREATEST PORTRAITS IN HUMAN HISTORY AND THESE I'LL JUST SHOW
MiltonGlaser_1998 THESE WITHOUT COMMENT IT'S JUST A SERIES OF VARIATIONS ON THE HEAD OF THE DUKE OF MONTEFELTRO WHO 'S A GREAT GREAT FIGURE IN THE RENAISSANCE AND PROBABLY THE BASIS FOR MACHIAVELLI 'S THE
MiltonGlaser_1998 IN BATTLE WHICH IS WHY HE IS ALWAYS SHOWN IN PROFILE
MiltonGlaser_1998 AND THIS IS BATTISTA
MiltonGlaser_1998 AND THEN I DECIDED I COULD MOVE THEM AROUND A LITTLE
MiltonGlaser_1998 SO THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THEY'RE FACING THE SAME DIRECTION
MiltonGlaser_1998 AND THEN A VISITOR FROM ANOTHER PAINTING BY PIERO THIS IS FROM THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
MiltonGlaser_1998 AS THOUGH THE CAST HAD JUST GOTTEN OF THE SET TO HAVE A CHAT AND NOW FOUR LARGE PANELS THIS IS UPPER LEFT
MiltonGlaser_1998 RIGHT LOWER LEFT LOWER
MiltonGlaser_1998 I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE CONFLICT BETWEEN ABSTRACTION AND
MiltonGlaser_1998 I WAS DRIVING IN THE COUNTRY ONE DAY WITH MY WIFE AND I SAW THIS SIGN AND I SAID THAT IS A FABULOUS PIECE OF DESIGN AND SHE SAID WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT I SAID WELL IT'S SO PERSUASIVE BECAUSE
MiltonGlaser_1998 THE PURPOSE OF THAT SIGN IS TO GET YOU INTO THE
MiltonGlaser_1998 THEY USE THE WORD RELIABLE BUT EVERYBODY SAYS THEY'RE RELIABLE BUT RELIABLE
MiltonGlaser_1998 SO ON AND SO THE ENTIRE ISSUE IS DETOXIFIED BY THE USE OF DUTCHMAN NOW IF YOU THINK I'M
MiltonGlaser_1998 AT ALL IN THIS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SUBSTITUTE SOMETHING ELSE LIKE
MiltonGlaser_1998 OR EVEN FRENCH
MiltonGlaser_1998 NOW SWISS WORKS BUT YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO COST A LOT OF MONEY
MiltonGlaser_1998 I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU QUICKLY THROUGH THE ACTUAL PROCESS OF DOING A POSTER I DO A LOT OF WORK FOR THE SCHOOL OF VISUAL ARTS WHERE I TEACH AND THE DIRECTOR OF THIS SCHOOL A REMARKABLE MAN NAMED SILAS RHODES OFTEN
MiltonGlaser_1998 HOLD ALIKE FANTASTIC IF TOO NEW OR OLD BE NOT THE FIRST BY WHOM THE NEW ARE TRIED NOR YET THE LAST TO LAY THE OLD ASIDE I COULD MAKE NOTHING OF
MiltonGlaser_1998 AND I REALLY STRUGGLED WITH THIS ONE AND THE FIRST THING I DID WHICH WAS SORT OF IN THE ABSENCE OF ANOTHER IDEA WAS SAY I'LL SORT OF WRITE IT OUT AND MAKE SOME WORDS BIG AND I'LL HAVE SOME KIND OF
MiltonGlaser_1998 DESIGN ON THE BACK
MiltonGlaser_1998 SOMEHOW AND I WAS HOPING AS ONE OFTEN DOES TO STUMBLE INTO SOMETHING
MiltonGlaser_1998 SO I TOOK ANOTHER SORT OF CRACK AT IT AND YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP IT MOVING I XEROXED SOME WORDS ON PIECES OF COLORED PAPER AND I PASTED THEM DOWN ON AN UGLY BOARD
MiltonGlaser_1998 I THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING WOULD COME OUT OF IT LIKE WORDS RULE FANTASTIC NEW OLD FIRST LAST POPE
MiltonGlaser_1998 BY ALEXANDER POPE BUT I SORT OF MADE A MESS OUT OF IT AND THEN I THOUGHT I'D REPEAT IT IN SOME WAY SO IT WAS LEGIBLE SO IT WAS GOING NOWHERE SOMETIMES
MiltonGlaser_1998 IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESISTANT PROBLEM I WRITE DOWN THINGS THAT I KNOW ABOUT IT
MiltonGlaser_1998 AND THEN I DID SOME VARIATIONS OF IT BUT IT STILL WASN'T SORT OF COALESCING GRAPHICALLY AT ALL I HAD THIS OTHER VERSION WHICH HAD SOMETHING INTERESTING ABOUT IT
MiltonGlaser_1998 IN TERMS OF
MiltonGlaser_1998 ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER IN YOUR MIND FROM CLUES THE W WAS CLEARLY A W THE N WAS CLEARLY AN N EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE
MiltonGlaser_1998 VERY FRAGMENTARY AND THERE WASN'T A LOT OF INFORMATION IN IT THEN I SORT OF GOT THE WORDS NEW AND OLD AND NOW I HAD REGRESSED BACK TO A POINT WHERE THERE SEEMED TO BE NO RETURN I WAS
MiltonGlaser_1998 REALLY DESPERATE AT THIS POINT AND SO I DO SOMETHING
MiltonGlaser_1998 TRUTHFULLY ASHAMED OF WHICH IS THAT I TOOK TWO DRAWINGS I HAD MADE FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE
MiltonGlaser_1998 AND I PUT THEM TOGETHER
MiltonGlaser_1998 AND IT SAYS DREAMS
MiltonGlaser_1998 THE TOP AND I WAS GOING TO DO A THING I SAY WELL CHANGE THE COPY LET IT SAY SOMETHING ABOUT DREAMS AND COME TO SVA AND YOU'LL SORT OF FULFILL YOUR DREAMS BUT TO MY CREDIT I
MiltonGlaser_1998 EMBARRASSED ABOUT DOING THAT THAT I NEVER SUBMITTED THIS SKETCH
MiltonGlaser_1998 AND FINALLY I ARRIVED AT THE FOLLOWING
MiltonGlaser_1998 SOLUTION NOW IT DOESN'T LOOK TERRIBLY INTERESTING BUT IT DOES HAVE SOMETHING THAT DISTINGUISHES IT FROM A LOT OF OTHER POSTERS
MiltonGlaser_1998 FOR ONE THING IT TRANSGRESSES THE IDEA OF WHAT A POSTER 'S SUPPOSED TO BE WHICH IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD AND SEEN
MiltonGlaser_1998 IMMEDIATELY AND NOT EXPLAINED I REMEMBER HEARING ALL OF YOU IN THE GRAPHIC ARTS IF YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT
MiltonGlaser_1998 AND ONE DAY I WOKE UP AND I SAID WELL SUPPOSE THAT'S NOT TRUE
MiltonGlaser_1998 HERE 'S WHAT IT SAYS IN MY EXPLANATION AT THE BOTTOM LEFT
MiltonGlaser_1998 IT SAYS THOUGHTS THIS POEM IS IMPOSSIBLE
MiltonGlaser_1998 SILAS USUALLY HAS A BETTER TOUCH WITH HIS CHOICE OF QUOTATIONS THIS ONE GENERATES NO
MiltonGlaser_1998 I AM NOW EXPOSING MYSELF TO MY AUDIENCE
MiltonGlaser_1998 RIGHT WHICH IS SOMETHING YOU NEVER WANT TO DO PROFESSIONALLY
MiltonGlaser_1998 MAYBE THE WORDS CAN MAKE THE IMAGE WITHOUT ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENING WHAT'S THE HEART OF THIS POEM DON'T BE TRENDY IF YOU WANT TO BE SERIOUS IS DOING
MiltonGlaser_1998 THE POSTER THIS WAY TRENDY IN ITSELF I GUESS ONE COULD REDUCE THE IDEA FURTHER BY SUGGESTING THAT THE NEW EMERGES BEHIND AND THROUGH THE OLD
MiltonGlaser_1998 LIKE THIS
MiltonGlaser_1998 AND THEN I SHOW YOU A LITTLE DRAWING YOU SEE YOU REMEMBER THAT OLD THING I DISCARDED WELL I FOUND A WAY TO USE IT SO THERE'S THAT LITTLE ALTERNATIVE OVER THERE
MiltonGlaser_1998 EACH DEFINES THE OTHER AND THEN MORE SELF QUESTIONING AM I BEING SIMPLE MINDED
MiltonGlaser_1998 AS ANY AMBITION DO YOU THINK THIS SORT OF THING COULD REALLY ATTRACT A STUDENT TO THE SCHOOL
MiltonGlaser_1998 WELL I THINK THERE ARE TWO FRESH THINGS HERE TWO FRESH THINGS ONE IS THE SORT OF
MiltonGlaser_1998 THE WILLINGNESS TO EXPOSE MYSELF TO A CRITICAL AUDIENCE AND NOT TO SUGGEST THAT I AM CONFIDENT ABOUT
MiltonGlaser_1998 WHAT I'M DOING AND AS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FRONT I MEAN YOU'VE GOT TO BE CONFIDENT IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN YOUR WORK WHO
MiltonGlaser_1998 SO THAT'S ONE THING SORT OF TO INTRODUCE THE IDEA OF DOUBT TO GRAPHICS THAT CAN BE A BIG CONTRIBUTION THE OTHER THING IS TO ACTUALLY GIVE YOU TWO SOLUTIONS FOR THE PRICE OF
MiltonGlaser_1998 YOU GET THE BIG ONE IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT HOW ABOUT THE LITTLE
MiltonGlaser_1998 AND THAT TOO IS A RELATIVELY NEW IDEA AND HERE 'S JUST A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS WHERE I ASK THE QUESTION
MiltonGlaser_1998 OF DOES A POSTER HAVE TO BE SQUARE NOW THIS IS A LITTLE ILLUSION THAT POSTER IS NOT FOLDED
MiltonGlaser_1998 IT'S NOT FOLDED THAT'S A PHOTOGRAPH AND IT'S CUT ON THE DIAGONAL
MiltonGlaser_1998 SAME CHEAP TRICK IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND
MiltonGlaser_1998 POSTER BECAUSE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF USING THE ISOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE IN THE COMPUTER IT
MiltonGlaser_1998 IN THE SPACE AT TIMES IT SEEMS TO BE WIDER AT THE BACK THAN THE FRONT AND THEN IT SHIFTS AND IF YOU SIT HERE LONG ENOUGH IT'LL FLOAT OFF THE PAGE INTO THE AUDIENCE
MiltonGlaser_1998 AND THEN AN EXPERIMENT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE NATURE OF PERSPECTIVE WHERE THE OUTSIDE SHAPE IS DETERMINED BY THE PECULIARITY OF PERSPECTIVE BUT THE SHAPE OF THE BOTTLE WHICH IS IDENTICAL TO THE OUTSIDE SHAPE
MiltonGlaser_1998 IS SEEN FRONTALLY AND ANOTHER
MiltonGlaser_1998 PIECE FOR THE ART DIRECTORS CLUB IS ANNA REES CASTING LONG SHADOWS THIS IS NOT A POSTER FROM THE SCHOOL OF VISUAL ARTS THERE WERE TEN ARTISTS
MiltonGlaser_1998 THE IDEA WAS AND IT WAS A BRILLIANT IDEA WAS TO HAVE TEN POSTERS DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE CITY 'S SUBWAY SYSTEM SO EVERY TIME YOU GOT ON THE SUBWAY YOU'D BE PASSING A DIFFERENT POSTER ALL OF WHICH HAD A DIFFERENT
MiltonGlaser_1998 OF WHAT ART IS BUT I WAS ABSOLUTELY STUCK ON THE IDEA OF ART IS AND TRYING TO
MiltonGlaser_1998 DETERMINE WHAT ART WAS
MiltonGlaser_1998 BUT THEN I GAVE UP AND I SAID WELL ART IS WHATEVER
MiltonGlaser_1998 THE WORD HAT WAS HIDDEN IN THE WORD WHATEVER AND THAT LED ME TO THE INEVITABLE CONCLUSION BUT THEN AGAIN IT'S
MiltonGlaser_1998 MY LIST OF DIDACTIC POSTERS MY INTENT IS TO HAVE A LITERARY ACCOMPANIMENT THAT EXPLAINS THE POSTER IN CASE YOU DON'T GET
MiltonGlaser_1998 THIS SAYS NOTE TO THE VIEWER I THOUGHT I MIGHT USE A VISUAL CLICHE OF OUR TIME MAGRITTE 'S EVERYMAN TO EXPRESS THE IDEA THAT ART IS MYSTERY CONTINUITY AND HISTORY
MiltonGlaser_1998 ALSO CONVINCED THAT IN AN AGE OF COMPUTER MANIPULATION SURREALISM HAS BECOME BANAL A SHADOW OF ITS FORMER SELF
MiltonGlaser_1998 THE PHRASE ART IS WHATEVER EXPRESSES THE CURRENT INCLUSIVENESS THAT SURROUNDS ART MAKING A SORT OF IT AIN'T WHAT YOU DO IT'S THE WAY THAT YOU DO IT NOTION
MiltonGlaser_1998 THE SHADOW OF MAGRITTE FALLS ACROSS THE CENTRAL PART OF THE POSTER A POETIC EVENT THAT OCCURS AS THE SHADOW MAN ISOLATES THE WORD HAT HIDDEN IN THE WORD WHATEVER
MiltonGlaser_1998 THING WHATEVER
MiltonGlaser_1998 THE ONE THAT I DID NOT SUBMIT WHICH I STILL LIKE I WANTED TO USE THE SAME PHRASE
MiltonGlaser_1998 AND
MiltonGlaser_1998 OF COURSE THOSE ARE THE REMAINS AND THEY'RE SO LABELED BUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENS IS YOU READ IT AS ART IS WHATEVER REMAINS THANK YOU
