AliCarrChellman_2010X@16.42:18.96 SO I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BOYS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@19.50:21.26 AND IT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH BOYS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@22.14:29.38 THEIR CULTURE ISN'T WORKING IN SCHOOLS AND I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU WAYS THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT OVERCOMING THAT PROBLEM
AliCarrChellman_2010X@30.14:31.83 TO START BY SAYING THIS IS A
AliCarrChellman_2010X@32.95:44.41 AND THIS IS A GIRL AND THIS IS PROBABLY STEREOTYPICALLY WHAT YOU THINK OF AS A BOY AND A GIRL IF I ESSENTIALIZE GENDER FOR YOU TODAY THEN YOU CAN DISMISS WHAT I HAVE TO SAY SO I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN DOING THAT
AliCarrChellman_2010X@44.72:54.91 THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF BOY AND A DIFFERENT KIND OF GIRL SO THE POINT HERE IS THAT NOT ALL BOYS EXIST WITHIN THESE RIGID BOUNDARIES OF WHAT WE THINK OF AS BOYS AND GIRLS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@65.24:73.93 THE POINT IS THAT FOR BOYS THE WAY THAT THEY EXIST AND THE CULTURE THAT THEY EMBRACE ISN'T WORKING WELL IN SCHOOLS NOW HOW DO WE KNOW THAT
AliCarrChellman_2010X@74.40:76.53 THE ONE HUNDRED GIRLS PROJECT TELLS US
AliCarrChellman_2010X@77.31:85.38 SOME REALLY NICE STATISTICS FOR EXAMPLE FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED GIRLS THAT ARE SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BOYS THAT ARE SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL
AliCarrChellman_2010X@85.72:90.97 FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED GIRLS WHO ARE EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE BOYS WHO ARE EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL
AliCarrChellman_2010X@91.39:95.51 FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED GIRLS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN BOYS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@95.95:99.96 FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED GIRLS WITH A LEARNING DISABILITY THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX BOYS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@100.64:111.16 FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED GIRLS WITH AN EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE DIAGNOSED WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR BOYS AND BY THE WAY ALL OF THESE NUMBERS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE BLACK
AliCarrChellman_2010X@113.83:116.09 YOU HAPPEN TO EXIST IN AN OVERCROWDED SCHOOL
AliCarrChellman_2010X@117.64:118.71 AND IF YOU ARE A
AliCarrChellman_2010X@119.92:125.85 FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH ADHD ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER
AliCarrChellman_2010X@126.57:129.07 NOW THERE IS ANOTHER SIDE TO THIS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@129.73:132.27 AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT
AliCarrChellman_2010X@132.87:134.73 WOMEN STILL NEED HELP IN SCHOOL
AliCarrChellman_2010X@135.32:143.22 THAT SALARIES ARE STILL SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER EVEN WHEN CONTROLLED FOR JOB TYPES AND THAT GIRLS HAVE CONTINUED TO STRUGGLE IN MATH AND SCIENCE FOR YEARS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@144.12:151.36 THAT'S ALL TRUE NOTHING ABOUT THAT PREVENTS US FROM PAYING ATTENTION TO THE LITERACY NEEDS OF OUR BOYS BETWEEN AGES THREE AND THIRTEEN
AliCarrChellman_2010X@152.23:156.98 AND SO WE SHOULD IN FACT WHAT WE OUGHT TO DO IS TAKE A PAGE FROM THEIR PLAYBOOK BECAUSE
AliCarrChellman_2010X@157.50:168.01 THE INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN SET IN PLACE FOR WOMEN IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS ARE FANTASTIC THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF GOOD FOR GIRLS IN THESE SITUATIONS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@168.63:173.42 AND WE OUGHT TO BE THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN FOR BOYS TOO IN THEIR YOUNGER YEARS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@189.23:199.43 WE MAY BE GETTING CLOSE TO SEVENTY PERCENT FEMALE POPULATION IN UNIVERSITIES THIS MAKES UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATORS VERY NERVOUS BECAUSE GIRLS DON'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOLS THAT DON'T HAVE BOYS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@202.87:212.84 WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MEN CENTERS AND MEN STUDIES TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE ENGAGE MEN IN THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THE UNIVERSITY IF YOU TALK TO FACULTY THEY MAY SAY
AliCarrChellman_2010X@213.88:223.68 WELL THEY'RE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES AND THEY'RE GAMBLING ONLINE ALL NIGHT LONG AND THEY'RE PLAYING WORLD OF WARCRAFT AND THAT'S AFFECTING THEIR ACADEMIC
AliCarrChellman_2010X@225.91:231.30 GUESS WHAT VIDEO GAMES ARE NOT THE CAUSE VIDEO GAMES ARE A SYMPTOM
AliCarrChellman_2010X@231.90:234.95 THEY WERE TURNED OFF A LONG TIME BEFORE THEY GOT HERE
AliCarrChellman_2010X@236.57:241.95 SO LET 'S TALK ABOUT WHY THEY GOT TURNED OFF WHEN THEY WERE BETWEEN THE AGES OF THREE AND THIRTEEN
AliCarrChellman_2010X@242.57:247.73 THERE ARE THREE REASONS THAT I BELIEVE THAT BOYS ARE OUT OF SYNC WITH THE CULTURE OF SCHOOLS TODAY
AliCarrChellman_2010X@255.76:260.05 AND WHEN HE DID SHE HAD TO GO THROUGH AND PULL OUT ALL THE LITTLE PLASTIC GUNS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@262.38:265.04 YOU CAN'T HAVE PLASTIC KNIVES AND SWORDS AND AXES AND ALL
AliCarrChellman_2010X@266.34:271.38 IN A KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE AFRAID THAT THIS YOUNG MAN IS GOING TO DO WITH THIS GUN
AliCarrChellman_2010X@272.00:272.87 I MEAN REALLY
AliCarrChellman_2010X@274.07:281.13 BUT HERE HE STANDS AS TESTAMENT TO THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T ROUGHHOUSE ON THE PLAYGROUND TODAY NOW I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR BULLIES
AliCarrChellman_2010X@281.75:290.90 I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE NEED TO BE ALLOWING GUNS AND KNIVES INTO SCHOOL BUT WHEN WE SAY THAT AN EAGLE SCOUT IN A HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM
AliCarrChellman_2010X@324.46:328.95 TO WRITE POEMS AND LITTLE MOMENTS IN MY LIFE I DON'T WANT TO WRITE THAT STUFF
AliCarrChellman_2010X@330.55:339.08 WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT TO WRITE WHAT DO YOU WANT TO WRITE ABOUT I WANT TO WRITE ABOUT VIDEO GAMES I WANT TO WRITE ABOUT LEVELING UP I WANT TO WRITE ABOUT THIS REALLY INTERESTING WORLD I WANT TO WRITE ABOUT
AliCarrChellman_2010X@355.00:356.89 THE ANSWER IS NO HE 'S JUST A BOY
AliCarrChellman_2010X@357.86:359.11 HE 'S JUST A LITTLE BOY
AliCarrChellman_2010X@360.56:364.08 IT'S NOT OKAY TO WRITE THESE KINDS OF THINGS IN CLASSROOMS TODAY
AliCarrChellman_2010X@372.59:381.83 THERE ARE FEWER MALE TEACHERS ANYBODY WHO 'S OVER FIFTEEN DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS BECAUSE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM TEACHERS HAS BEEN CUT IN HALF
AliCarrChellman_2010X@392.88:394.26 NOW WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THIS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@395.13:397.14 WOMEN ARE GREAT YEP ABSOLUTELY BUT
AliCarrChellman_2010X@397.85:410.41 MALE ROLE MODELS FOR BOYS THAT SAY IT'S ALL RIGHT TO BE SMART THEY'VE GOT DADS THEY'VE GOT PASTORS THEY'VE GOT CUB SCOUT LEADERS BUT ULTIMATELY SIX HOURS A DAY FIVE DAYS A WEEK THEY'RE SPENDING IN A CLASSROOM
AliCarrChellman_2010X@411.23:417.82 AND MOST OF THOSE CLASSROOMS ARE NOT PLACES WHERE MEN EXIST AND SO THEY SAY I GUESS THIS REALLY ISN'T A PLACE FOR BOYS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@441.21:443.50 TEACHERS LOUNGE AND THEY'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT
AliCarrChellman_2010X@456.45:460.13 YOU'LL SEE THE CONVERSATION CHANGES DEPENDING UPON WHO 'S SITTING AROUND THE TABLE
AliCarrChellman_2010X@461.02:469.72 THIRD REASON THAT BOYS ARE OUT OF SYNC WITH SCHOOL TODAY KINDERGARTEN IS THE OLD SECOND GRADE FOLKS WE HAVE A SERIOUS COMPRESSION OF THE CURRICULUM HAPPENING OUT THERE
AliCarrChellman_2010X@477.28:479.75 IN FIRST GRADE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO READ PARAGRAPHS OF
AliCarrChellman_2010X@481.22:494.77 WITH MAYBE A PICTURE MAYBE NOT IN A BOOK OF MAYBE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY PAGES IF YOU DON 'T WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE PUTTING YOU INTO A TITLE ONE SPECIAL READING PROGRAM AND IF YOU ASK TITLE ONE TEACHERS THEY'LL TELL YOU THEY'VE GOT ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE BOYS FOR EVERY GIRL THAT'S IN THEIR PROGRAM IN THE ELEMENTARY GRADES
AliCarrChellman_2010X@498.69:505.33 IS BECAUSE THE MESSAGE THAT BOYS ARE GETTING IS YOU NEED TO DO WHAT THE TEACHER ASKS YOU TO DO ALL THE TIME
AliCarrChellman_2010X@506.45:517.43 THE TEACHER 'S SALARY DEPENDS ON NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND AND RACE TO THE TOP AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND TESTING AND ALL OF THIS SO SHE HAS TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
AliCarrChellman_2010X@544.43:547.93 AND SO THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM WHERE IS IT COMING FROM IT'S COMING FROM
AliCarrChellman_2010X@556.34:560.12 WE WANT TO LIVE IN LAKE WOBEGON WHERE EVERY CHILD IS ABOVE AVERAGE
AliCarrChellman_2010X@561.75:568.30 BUT WHAT THIS DOES TO OUR CHILDREN IS REALLY NOT HEALTHY IT'S NOT DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE AND IT'S PARTICULARLY BAD FOR BOYS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@571.32:574.66 NEED TO MEET THEM WHERE THEY ARE WE NEED TO PUT OURSELVES INTO BOY CULTURE
AliCarrChellman_2010X@575.28:581.65 WE NEED TO CHANGE THE MINDSET OF ACCEPTANCE IN BOYS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@584.56:589.05 VERY SPECIFIC THINGS WE CAN DESIGN BETTER GAMES MOST OF THE EDUCATIONAL GAMES THAT ARE OUT THERE
AliCarrChellman_2010X@590.20:591.29 ARE REALLY FLASHCARDS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@591.90:597.10 THEY'RE GLORIFIED DRILL AND PRACTICE THEY DON'T HAVE THE DEPTH THE RICH NARRATIVE THAT
AliCarrChellman_2010X@597.55:602.49 REALLY ENGAGING VIDEO GAMES HAVE THAT THE BOYS ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN SO WE NEED TO DESIGN BETTER GAMES
AliCarrChellman_2010X@622.46:626.88 ALL OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS NEED TO BE HAPPENING THERE ARE SOME GREAT EXAMPLES OUT THERE OF SCHOOLS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@627.91:635.98 THE NEW YORK TIMES JUST TALKED ABOUT A SCHOOL RECENTLY A GAME DESIGNER FROM THE NEW SCHOOL PUT TOGETHER A WONDERFUL VIDEO GAMING SCHOOL
AliCarrChellman_2010X@637.15:650.72 IT ONLY TREATS A FEW KIDS AND SO THIS ISN'T VERY SCALABLE WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE CULTURE AND THE FEELINGS THAT POLITICIANS AND SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS AND PARENTS HAVE ABOUT THE WAY WE ACCEPT AND WHAT WE ACCEPT IN OUR SCHOOLS TODAY
AliCarrChellman_2010X@651.65:659.35 WE HAVE TO FIND MORE MONEY FOR GAME DESIGN BECAUSE GOOD GAMES REALLY GOOD GAMES COST MONEY AND WORLD OF WARCRAFT HAS QUITE A BUDGET MOST OF THE EDUCATIONAL GAMES DO NOT
AliCarrChellman_2010X@670.66:678.38 AND WE DISCOVERED THAT THEY TALK ABOUT THE KIDS IN THEIR SCHOOL WHO TALK ABOUT GAMING IN PRETTY DEMEANING WAYS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@678.94:684.61 THEY SAY OH YEAH THEY'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT THAT STUFF THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THEIR LITTLE ACTION FIGURES AND THEIR LITTLE
AliCarrChellman_2010X@701.75:713.58 NERVOUS ABOUT ANYTHING THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH VIOLENCE BECAUSE OF THE ZERO TOLERANCE POLICIES THEY ARE SURE THAT PARENTS AND ADMINISTRATORS WILL NEVER ACCEPT ANYTHING SO WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT LOOKING AT TEACHER ATTITUDES AND FINDING WAYS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@714.03:720.45 TO CHANGE THE ATTITUDES SO THAT TEACHERS ARE MUCH MORE OPEN AND ACCEPTING OF BOY CULTURES IN THEIR CLASSROOMS
AliCarrChellman_2010X@720.87:722.03 BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IF WE DON
AliCarrChellman_2010X@723.18:725.41 HAVE BOYS WHO LEAVE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SAYING
AliCarrChellman_2010X@741.68:742.59 YOU
