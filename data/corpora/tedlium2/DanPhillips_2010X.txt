DanPhillips_2010X@236.73:238.96 THE FAUCET THERE IS A BEER TAP

DanPhillips_2010X@254.15:264.55 DESIGN FAILS SO DON'T PUT IT IN THE FRONT DOOR PUT IT SOMEWHERE ELSE IT'S A PRETTY PANEL OF GLASS BUT THEN IF YOU PUT IT IN THE FRONT DOOR PEOPLE SAY OH YOU'RE TRYING TO BE LIKE THOSE GUYS AND YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT SO DON'T PUT IT THERE

DanPhillips_2010X@278.17:282.85 BUT NOT IN THE FOYER THEN SOMEBODY GAVE ME A BIDET SO
DanPhillips_2010X@286.76:295.05 THIS LITTLE HOUSE HERE THOSE BRANCHES THERE ARE MADE OUT OF BOIS D 'ARK OR OSAGE ORANGE AND THESE PICTURES WILL KEEP SCROLLING AS I TALK A LITTLE BIT
DanPhillips_2010X@295.49:303.81 IN ORDER TO DO WHAT I DO YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CAUSES WASTE IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY OUR HOUSING HAS BECOME A COMMODITY
DanPhillips_2010X@304.48:312.20 AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT BUT THE FIRST CAUSE OF WASTE IS PROBABLY EVEN BURIED IN OUR DNA HUMAN BEINGS HAVE A NEED FOR MAINTAINING CONSISTENCY FOR THE
DanPhillips_2010X@315.14:326.23 WHAT IT MEANS IS FOR EVERY PERCEPTION WE HAVE IT NEEDS TO TALLY WITH THE ONE LIKE IT BEFORE OR WE DON'T HAVE CONTINUITY AND WE BECOME A LITTLE BIT DISORIENTED SO I CAN SHOW YOU AN OBJECT YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE
DanPhillips_2010X@327.29:336.88 THAT'S A CELLPHONE BUT YOU'VE NEVER THIS ONE BEFORE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS SIZING UP THE PATTERN OF STRUCTURAL FEATURES HERE AND THEN YOU GO THROUGH YOUR
DanPhillips_2010X@338.68:344.32 THAT'S A CELLPHONE IF I TOOK A BIT OUT OF IT YOU'D GO WAIT A SECOND
DanPhillips_2010X@345.98:349.96 NOT A CELLPHONE THAT'S ONE OF THOSE NEW CHOCOLATE CELLPHONES
DanPhillips_2010X@351.99:354.89 HAVE TO START A NEW CATEGORY RIGHT BETWEEN CELLPHONES AND
DanPhillips_2010X@371.57:384.58 NEVER MIND THAT IT DOESN'T AFFECT OUR LIVES AT ALL IT ONLY RATTLES THAT EXPECTED PATTERN AND UNITY OF STRUCTURAL FEATURES HOWEVER IF WE TOOK A SMALL HAMMER AND WE ADDED CRACKS TO ALL THE OTHER WINDOWS
DanPhillips_2010X@386.83:394.27 THEN WE HAVE A PATTERN BECAUSE GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY EMPHASIZES RECOGNITION OF PATTERN OVER PARTS THAT COMPRISE A PATTERN WE'LL GO OOH THAT'S
DanPhillips_2010X@396.50:400.99 THAT SERVES ME EVERY DAY REPETITION CREATES PATTERN IF I HAVE A HUNDRED OF THESE A HUNDRED OF THOSE
DanPhillips_2010X@401.20:409.63 IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHAT THESE AND THOSE ARE IF I CAN REPEAT ANYTHING I HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF A PATTERN FROM HICKORY NUTS AND CHICKEN EGGS SHARDS OF GLASS BRANCHES
DanPhillips_2010X@421.08:433.19 HE SAID THAT CULTURES TEND TO SWING BETWEEN ONE OF TWO PERSPECTIVES ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE AN APOLLONIAN PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS VERY CRISP AND PREMEDITATED AND INTELLECTUALIZED AND PERFECT
DanPhillips_2010X@446.20:452.50 OR HANGS A PICTURE IS THEY'LL GET OUT A TRANSIT AND A LASER LEVEL AND A MICROMETER
DanPhillips_2010X@453.08:462.79 OKAY HONEY A THOUSANDTH OF AN INCH TO THE LEFT THAT'S WHERE WE WANT THE PICTURE RIGHT PERFECT PREDICATED ON PLUM LEVEL SQUARE AND CENTERED THE DIONYSIAN PERSONALITY TAKES THE PICTURE AND
DanPhillips_2010X@471.64:482.55 FEATURE BLEMISH I FEATURE ORGANIC PROCESS DEAD CENTER JOHN DEWEY APOLLONIAN MINDSET CREATES MOUNTAINS OF WASTE IF SOMETHING ISN'T PERFECT
DanPhillips_2010X@482.95:491.54 IF IT DOES LINE UP WITH THAT PREMEDITATED MODEL DUMPSTER OOPS SCRATCH DUMPSTER OOPS THIS OOPS THAT LANDFILL LANDFILL LANDFILL THE THIRD THING
DanPhillips_2010X@492.18:498.73 IS ARGUABLY THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION STARTED IN THE RENAISSANCE WITH THE RISE OF HUMANISM THEN GOT A LITTLE JUMP START
DanPhillips_2010X@509.37:519.12 THAT WE UP TO THAT POINT HAD TO DO MY HAND SO NOW WE HAVE STANDARDIZED MATERIALS WELL TREES DON'T GROW TWO INCHES BY FOUR INCHES EIGHT TEN AND TWELVE FEET TALL
DanPhillips_2010X@520.48:532.44 WE CREATE MOUNTAINS OF WASTE AND THEY'RE DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB THERE IN THE FOREST WORKING ALL THE BYPRODUCT OF THEIR INDUSTRY WITH OSB AND PARTICLE BOARD AND SO FORTH AND SO ON BUT IT DOES NO GOOD
DanPhillips_2010X@532.88:539.93 TO BE RESPONSIBLE AT THE POINT OF HARVEST IN THE FOREST IF CONSUMERS ARE WASTING THE HARVEST AT THE POINT OF CONSUMPTION AND THAT'S WHAT'S
DanPhillips_2010X@552.04:559.95 WELL I FEATURE ALL THOSE WARPED THINGS BECAUSE REPETITION CREATES PATTERN AND IT'S FROM A DIONYSIAN PERSPECTIVE THE FOURTH THING
DanPhillips_2010X@560.96:568.60 LABOR IS DISPROPORTIONATELY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MATERIALS WELL THAT'S JUST A MYTH AND HERE 'S A STORY JIM TULLES ONE OF THE GUYS I TRAINED
DanPhillips_2010X@569.58:577.08 IT'S TIME NOW I GOT A JOB FOR YOU AS A FOREMAN ON A FRAMING CREW IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO DAN I JUST DON'T THINK I'M READY JIM NOW IT'S TIME
DanPhillips_2010X@578.83:585.73 SO WE HIRED ON AND HE WAS OUT THERE WITH HIS TAPE MEASURE GOING THROUGH THE TRASH HEAP LOOKING FOR HEADER MATERIAL WHICH IS THE BOARD THAT GOES OVER
DanPhillips_2010X@600.64:612.42 HE SAID YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE PAYING ME DOLLAR THREE HUNDRED AN HOUR I CAN SEE HOW YOU MIGHT SAY THAT BUT RIGHT NOW I'M SAVING YOU FIVE DOLLARS A MINUTE DO THE MATH
DanPhillips_2010X@639.82:647.83 AND WE FORCE ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES TO ACCOMMODATE THAT SO ALL HAVE IN OUR HEAD THE PERFECT HOUSE THE AMERICAN DREAM WHICH IS A HOUSE THE
DanPhillips_2010X@657.90:668.81 IT'S A CHATTEL MORTGAGE JUST LIKE FURNITURE JUST LIKE A CAR YOU WRITE THE CHECK AND INSTANTLY IT DEPRECIATES THIRTY PERCENT AFTER A YEAR YOU CAN'T GET INSURANCE ON EVERYTHING YOU HAVE IN IT ONLY ON SEVENTY PERCENT
DanPhillips_2010X@669.34:678.47 WIRED WITH FOURTEEN GAUGE WIRE TYPICALLY NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT UNLESS YOU ASK IT TO DO WHAT TWELVE GAUGE WIRE 'S SUPPOSED TO DO AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IT OUT GASSES FORMALDEHYDE SO MUCH
DanPhillips_2010X@679.21:686.12 THAT THERE IS A FEDERAL LAW IN PLACE TO WARN NEW MOBILE HOME BUYERS OF THE FORMALDEHYDE ATMOSPHERE DANGER
DanPhillips_2010X@686.60:693.78 ARE WE JUST BEING NUMBINGLY STUPID THE WALLS ARE THIS THICK THE WHOLE THING HAS THE STRUCTURAL VALUE OF CORN
DanPhillips_2010X@695.65:701.54 SO I THOUGHT PALM HARBOR VILLAGE WAS OVER THERE NO NO WE HAD A WIND LAST NIGHT IT'S GONE NOW
DanPhillips_2010X@705.01:709.16 THEN WHEN THEY DEGRADE WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THEM NOW ALL THAT
DanPhillips_2010X@710.04:717.47 THAT APOLLONIAN PLATONIC MODEL IS WHAT THE BUILDING INDUSTRY IS PREDICATED ON AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT EXACERBATE THAT
DanPhillips_2010X@718.17:726.44 ONE IS THAT ALL THE PROFESSIONALS ALL THE TRADESMEN VENDORS INSPECTORS ENGINEERS ARCHITECTS ALL THINK LIKE THIS
DanPhillips_2010X@726.91:736.01 AND THEN IT WORKS ITS WAY BACK TO THE CONSUMER WHO DEMANDS THE SAME MODEL IT'S A SELF FULFILLING PROPHESY WE CAN'T GET OUT OF IT THEN HERE COME THE MARKETEERS AND THE ADVERTISERS
DanPhillips_2010X@739.33:742.38 WE BUY STUFF WE DIDN'T KNOW WE NEEDED ALL WE
DanPhillips_2010X@742.51:747.63 TO DO IS LOOK AT WHAT ONE COMPANY DID WITH CARBONATED PRUNE JUICE HOW DISGUSTING
DanPhillips_2010X@749.80:752.17 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID THEY HOOKED A METAPHOR INTO IT
DanPhillips_2010X@764.07:774.89 MY OH MY THAT MAKES IT WORSE AND WE GET SUCKED INTO THAT FASTER THAN ANYTHING THEN A MAN NAMED JEAN PAUL SARTRE WROTE A BOOK TITLED BEING AND NOTHINGNESS IT'S A PRETTY QUICK READ YOU CAN SNAP THROUGH IT
DanPhillips_2010X@777.24:780.30 MAYBE TWO YEARS IF YOU READ EIGHT HOURS A DAY
DanPhillips_2010X@781.05:790.20 THERE HE TALKED ABOUT THE DIVIDED SELF HE SAID HUMAN BEINGS ACT DIFFERENTLY WHEN THEY KNOW THEY'RE ALONE THAN WHEN THEY KNOW SOMEBODY ELSE IS AROUND SO IF I'M EATING SPAGHETTI AND I KNOW I'M ALONE
DanPhillips_2010X@790.53:800.92 I CAN EAT LIKE BACKHOE I CAN WIPE MY MOUTH ON MY SLEEVE NAPKIN ON THE TABLE CHEW WITH MY MOUTH OPEN MAKE LITTLE NOISES SCRATCH WHEREVER I WANT
DanPhillips_2010X@802.70:804.36 BUT AS SOON AS YOU WALK IN I GO
DanPhillips_2010X@808.06:818.24 BITES CHEW WITH MY MOUTH CLOSED NO SCRATCHING NOW WHAT I'M DOING IS FULFILLING YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF HOW I SHOULD LIVE MY LIFE
DanPhillips_2010X@819.24:827.72 I FEEL THAT EXPECTATION AND SO I ACCOMMODATE IT AND I'M LIVING MY LIFE ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU EXPECT ME TO DO THAT HAPPENS IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY AS WELL
DanPhillips_2010X@828.04:839.06 THAT'S WHY ALL OF OUR SUBDIVISIONS LOOK THE SAME SOMETIMES WE EVEN HAVE THESE FORMALIZED CULTURAL EXPECTATIONS I'LL BET ALL YOUR SHOES MATCH SURE ENOUGH WE ALL BUY INTO THAT
DanPhillips_2010X@841.55:849.45 GATED COMMUNITIES WE HAVE A FORMALIZED EXPECTATION WITH A HOME OWNERS ASSOCIATION SOMETIMES THOSE GUYS ARE NAZIS MY
DanPhillips_2010X@851.45:851.65 THAT
DanPhillips_2010X@852.97:861.96 CONTINUES THIS MODEL THE LAST THING IS GREGARIOUSNESS HUMAN BEINGS ARE A SOCIAL SPECIES WE LIKE TO HAND TOGETHER IN GROUPS
DanPhillips_2010X@874.07:880.80 AND SO YOU SEE THIS IN JUNIOR HIGH A LOT THOSE KIDS THEY'LL WORK ALL SUMMER LONG KILL THEMSELVES
DanPhillips_2010X@881.15:891.63 SO THAT THEY CAN AFFORD ONE PAIR OF DESIGNER JEANS SO ALONG ABOUT SEPTEMBER THEY CAN STRIDE IN AND GO I 'M IMPORTANT TODAY SEE
DanPhillips_2010X@904.58:913.61 AND SO THAT HAPPENS IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY AS WELL WE HAVE CONFUSED MASLOW 'S HIERARCHY OF NEEDS JUST A LITTLE BIT
DanPhillips_2010X@913.97:919.27 ON THE BOTTOM TIER WE HAVE BASIC NEEDS SHELTER CLOTHING FOOD WATER
DanPhillips_2010X@941.55:952.38 HOUSING HAS BECOME A COMMODITY AND IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF NERVE TO DIVE INTO THOSE PRIMAL TERRIFYING PARTS OF OURSELVES
DanPhillips_2010X@952.96:965.18 AND MAKE OUR OWN DECISIONS AND NOT MAKE OUR HOUSING A COMMODITY BUT MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT BUBBLES UP FROM SEMINAL SOURCES THAT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF NERVE AND DARN IT ONCE IN A WHILE YOU FAIL
DanPhillips_2010X@966.71:967.15 BUT
DanPhillips_2010X@967.34:972.53 THAT'S OKAY IF FAILURE DESTROYS YOU THEN YOU CAN'T DO THIS I FAIL
DanPhillips_2010X@972.76:976.79 ALL THE TIME EVERYDAY AND I'VE HAD SOME WHOPPING FAILURES I

DanPhillips_2010X@1001.05:1008.22 BUT YOU DON'T SAY THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE THE GUYS YOU'RE TARGETING AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE
DanPhillips_2010X@1008.71:1017.79 AND THIS ISN'T JUST IN HOUSING IT'S IN CLOTHING AND FOOD AND OUR TRANSPORTATION NEEDS OUR ENERGY WE SPRAWL JUST A LITTLE BIT AND
DanPhillips_2010X@1018.34:1028.25 WHEN I GET A LITTLE BIT OF PRESS I HEAR FROM PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD AND WE MAY HAVE INVENTED EXCESS BUT THE PROBLEM OF WASTE IS
DanPhillips_2010X@1032.47:1040.54 WE'RE IN TROUBLE AND I DON'T WEAR AMMO BELTS CRISSCROSSING MY CHEST AND A RED BANDANA BUT WE'RE CLEARLY IN TROUBLE
DanPhillips_2010X@1041.14:1048.24 AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS RECONNECT WITH THOSE REALLY PRIMAL PARTS OF OURSELVES
DanPhillips_2010X@1060.26:1067.45 WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS RECONNECT WITH WHO WE REALLY ARE AND THAT'S THRILLING INDEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH
