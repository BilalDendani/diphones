JasonClay_2010G IN MISSOURI WE LIVED ON LESS THAN A DOLLAR A DAY FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS I GOT A SCHOLARSHIP WENT TO UNIVERSITY
JasonClay_2010G STUDIED INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURE STUDIED ANTHROPOLOGY AND DECIDED I WAS GOING TO GIVE BACK I WAS GOING TO WORK WITH SMALL FARMERS I WAS GOING TO HELP ALLEVIATE POVERTY I WAS GOING TO WORK ON INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
JasonClay_2010G AND THEN I TOOK A TURN
JasonClay_2010G AND ENDED UP HERE NOW IF YOU GET A PH D AND YOU DECIDE NOT TO TEACH YOU DON'T ALWAYS END UP IN A PLACE LIKE THIS IT'S A CHOICE YOU MIGHT END UP DRIVING A TAXICAB YOU COULD BE IN NEW YORK
JasonClay_2010G WHAT I FOUND WAS I STARTED WORKING WITH REFUGEES AND FAMINE VICTIMS SMALL FARMERS ALL OR NEARLY ALL WHO HAD BEEN DISPOSSESSED AND
JasonClay_2010G WHAT I'D BEEN TRAINED TO DO WAS METHODOLOGICAL RESEARCH ON SUCH PEOPLE
JasonClay_2010G SO I DID IT I FOUND OUT HOW MANY WOMEN HAD BEEN RAPED EN ROUTE TO THESE CAMPS I FOUND OUT HOW MANY PEOPLE HAD BEEN PUT IN JAIL
JasonClay_2010G HOW MANY FAMILY MEMBERS HAD BEEN KILLED I ASSESSED HOW LONG THEY WERE GOING TO STAY AND HOW MUCH IT WOULD TAKE TO FEED THEM
JasonClay_2010G AND I GOT REALLY GOOD AT PREDICTING HOW MANY BODY BAGS YOU WOULD NEED FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO DIE IN THESE CAMPS
JasonClay_2010G NOW THIS IS GOD 'S WORK
JasonClay_2010G HE SAID WHAT CAN I DO TO SAVE THE RAINFORESTS I SAID WELL BEN WHAT DO YOU DO I MAKE ICE CREAM SO I SAID WELL YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE
JasonClay_2010G IT WAS A GREAT SUCCESS
JasonClay_2010G WE DID OUR FIRST MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF TRADE BY BUYING ON THIRTY DAYS AND SELLING ON TWENTY ONE THAT GETS YOUR ADRENALINE GOING
JasonClay_2010G THEN WE HAD A FOUR AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR LINE OF CREDIT BECAUSE WE WERE CREDIT WORTHY AT THAT POINT
JasonClay_2010G FIFTY COMPANIES SIGNED UP TWO HUNDRED PRODUCTS CAME OUT GENERATED ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN SALES
JasonClay_2010G IT FAILED
JasonClay_2010G BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE GATHERING BRAZIL NUTS WEREN'T THE SAME PEOPLE WHO WERE CUTTING THE FORESTS AND THE PEOPLE WHO MADE MONEY FROM BRAZIL NUTS WERE NOT THE PEOPLE WHO MADE MONEY FROM CUTTING THE FORESTS
JasonClay_2010G WE WERE ATTACKING THE WRONG DRIVER WE NEEDED TO BE WORKING ON BEEF WE NEEDED TO BE WORKING ON LUMBER WE NEEDED TO BE WORKING ON SOY THINGS THAT WE WERE NOT FOCUSED ON
JasonClay_2010G SO LET 'S GO BACK TO SUDAN
JasonClay_2010G THIS FARMER SAID TO ME ONE DAY SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY PROFOUND HE SAID YOU CAN'T WAKE A PERSON WHO 'S PRETENDING TO SLEEP
JasonClay_2010G FAST FORWARD WE LIVE ON A PLANET THERE'S JUST ONE OF THEM
JasonClay_2010G GOT TO WAKE UP TO THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE
JasonClay_2010G AND THAT THIS IS A FINITE PLANET
JasonClay_2010G WE KNOW THE LIMITS OF THE RESOURCES WE HAVE
JasonClay_2010G WE MAY BE ABLE TO USE THEM DIFFERENTLY WE MAY HAVE SOME INNOVATIVE NEW IDEAS BUT IN GENERAL THIS IS WHAT WE'VE GOT THERE'S NO MORE OF
JasonClay_2010G THERE'S A BASIC EQUATION THAT WE CAN'T GET AWAY FROM
JasonClay_2010G LINE OF BEING IN A SUSTAINABLE RELATIONSHIP TO THE PLANET NOW WE'RE AT ONE POINT THREE IF WE WERE FARMERS WE'D BE EATING OUR SEED
JasonClay_2010G FOR BANKERS WE'D BE LIVING OFF THE PRINCIPAL NOT THE INTEREST THIS IS WHERE WE STAND TODAY
JasonClay_2010G LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO POINT TO SOME PLACE ELSE AS THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM IT'S ALWAYS POPULATION GROWTH
JasonClay_2010G WE'VE GOT TO THINK THAT CONSUMPTION IS AN ISSUE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT POPULATION AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THEM IT'S ABOUT US
JasonClay_2010G THERE'S VERY GOOD EVIDENCE AGAIN WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A PEER REVIEWED METHODOLOGY THAT'S BULLETPROOF YET BUT THERE'S VERY GOOD EVIDENCE THAT THE AVERAGE CAT IN EUROPE
JasonClay_2010G HAS A LARGER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT IN ITS LIFETIME THAN THE AVERAGE AFRICAN
JasonClay_2010G YOU THINK THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE GOING FORWARD YOU THINK THAT'S NOT A QUESTION AS TO HOW WE SHOULD BE USING THE EARTH 'S RESOURCES LET 'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATION
JasonClay_2010G IN TWO THOUSAND WE HAD SIX BILLION PEOPLE ON THE PLANET THEY WERE CONSUMING WHAT THEY WERE CONSUMING LET 'S SAY ONE UNIT OF CONSUMPTION EACH WE HAVE SIX BILLION UNITS OF CONSUMPTION
JasonClay_2010G FIVE TIMES WHAT IT IS TODAY ON GLOBAL AVERAGE ABOUT SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EIGHTEEN BILLION UNITS OF CONSUMPTION
JasonClay_2010G WHO HAVE YOU HEARD TALKING LATELY THAT'S SAID WE HAVE TO TRIPLE PRODUCTION OF GOODS AND SERVICES BUT THAT'S WHAT THE MATH SAYS WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
JasonClay_2010G WE CAN GET PRODUCTIVITY UP
JasonClay_2010G AND THEN WE NEED TO USE LESS AGAIN AND THEN WE NEED TO CONSUME LESS ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE PART OF THAT EQUATION BUT IT BASICALLY RAISES A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION
JasonClay_2010G SHOULD CONSUMERS HAVE A CHOICE ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS SHOULD YOU BE ABLE TO BUY A PRODUCT THAT'S SUSTAINABLE SITTING NEXT TO ONE THAT ISN 'T OR SHOULD ALL THE PRODUCTS ON THE SHELF BE SUSTAINABLE
JasonClay_2010G THE AVERAGE CONSUMER TAKES ONE POINT EIGHT SECONDS IN THE U S OKAY SO LET 'S BE GENEROUS LET 'S SAY IT'S THREE POINT FIVE SECONDS IN EUROPE
JasonClay_2010G HOW DO YOU EVALUATE ALL THE SCIENTIFIC DATA AROUND A PRODUCT THE DATA THAT'S CHANGING ON A WEEKLY IF NOT A DAILY BASIS
JasonClay_2010G HERE 'S A LITTLE QUESTION
JasonClay_2010G FROM A GREENHOUSE GAS PERSPECTIVE IS LAMB PRODUCED IN THE U K BETTER THAN LAMB PRODUCED IN NEW ZEALAND FROZEN AND SHIPPED TO THE U K
JasonClay_2010G IS A BAD FEEDER LOT OPERATION FOR BEEF BETTER OR WORSE THAN A BAD GRAZING OPERATION FOR BEEF
JasonClay_2010G DO ORGANIC POTATOES ACTUALLY HAVE FEWER TOXIC CHEMICALS USED TO PRODUCE THEM THAN CONVENTIONAL POTATOES
JasonClay_2010G IN EVERY SINGLE CASE THE ANSWER IS IT DEPENDS IT DEPENDS ON WHO PRODUCED IT AND HOW
JasonClay_2010G IN EVERY SINGLE INSTANCE AND THERE ARE MANY OTHERS HOW IS A CONSUMER GOING TO WALK THROUGH THIS MINE FIELD
JasonClay_2010G THEY'RE NOT THEY MAY HAVE A LOT OF OPINIONS ABOUT IT BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE TERRIBLY INFORMED
JasonClay_2010G IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING WE ALL CARE ABOUT
JasonClay_2010G AND WE NEED COLLUSION
JasonClay_2010G WE NEED GROUPS TO WORK TOGETHER THAT NEVER HAVE WE NEED CARGILL TO WORK WITH BUNGE WE NEED COKE TO WORK WITH PEPSI
JasonClay_2010G WE NEED OXFORD TO WORK WITH CAMBRIDGE WE NEED GREENPEACE TO WORK WITH WWF EVERYBODY 'S GOT TO WORK TOGETHER CHINA AND THE U S
JasonClay_2010G WE NEED TO BEGIN TO MANAGE THIS PLANET AS IF OUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT BECAUSE IT DOES
JasonClay_2010G IT FUNDAMENTALLY DOES
JasonClay_2010G SO THE WHERE WE'VE IDENTIFIED THIRTY FIVE PLACES GLOBALLY THAT WE NEED TO WORK THESE ARE THE PLACES THAT ARE THE RICHEST IN BIODIVERSITY AND THE MOST IMPORTANT FROM AN ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION POINT OF VIEW
JasonClay_2010G WE LOOKED AT THE THREATS TO THESE PLACES THESE ARE THE FIFTEEN COMMODITIES THAT FUNDAMENTALLY POSE THE BIGGEST THREATS TO THESE PLACES
JasonClay_2010G BECAUSE OF DEFORESTATION SOIL LOSS WATER USE PESTICIDE USE OVER FISHING ETC
JasonClay_2010G SO WE'VE GOT THIRTY FIVE PLACES WE'VE GOT FIFTEEN PRIORITY COMMODITIES WHO DO WE WORK WITH TO CHANGE THE WAY THOSE COMMODITIES ARE PRODUCED ARE WE GOING TO WORK WITH SIX POINT NINE BILLION CONSUMERS
JasonClay_2010G LET 'S SEE THAT'S ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND LANGUAGES THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MAJOR LANGUAGES A LOT OF WORK THERE I DON'T SEE ANYBODY ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO DO THAT VERY EFFECTIVELY
JasonClay_2010G ARE WE GOING TO WORK WITH ONE POINT FIVE BILLION PRODUCERS
JasonClay_2010G AGAIN A DAUNTING TASK THERE MUST BE A BETTER WAY
JasonClay_2010G OF THE TRADE OF EACH OF THE FIFTEEN COMMODITIES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IF WE WORK WITH THOSE IF WE CHANGE THOSE COMPANIES AND THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS THEN THE REST WILL HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY
JasonClay_2010G SO WE WENT THROUGH OUR FIFTEEN COMMODITIES THIS IS NINE OF THEM WE LINED THEM UP SIDE BY SIDE AND WE PUT THE NAMES OF THE COMPANIES THAT WORK ON EACH OF THOSE AND IF YOU GO
JasonClay_2010G THROUGH THE FIRST TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY NAMES OF EACH OF THE COMMODITIES WHAT YOU BEGIN TO SEE IS GOSH THERE'S CARGILL HERE THERE'S CARGILL THERE THERE'S CARGILL EVERYWHERE
JasonClay_2010G IN FACT THESE NAMES START COMING UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO WE DID THE ANALYSIS AGAIN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY
JasonClay_2010G WE SAID IF WE TAKE THE TOP HUNDRED COMPANIES WHAT PERCENTAGE OF ALL FIFTEEN COMMODITIES DO THEY TOUCH BUY OR SELL
JasonClay_2010G AND WHAT WE FOUND IS IT'S TWENTY FIVE PERCENT
JasonClay_2010G SO ONE HUNDRED COMPANIES
JasonClay_2010G WHY IS TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IMPORTANT
JasonClay_2010G BECAUSE IF THESE COMPANIES DEMAND SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS THEY'LL PULL FORTY TO FIFTY PERCENT OF PRODUCTION
JasonClay_2010G COMPANIES CAN PUSH PRODUCERS FASTER THAN CONSUMERS CAN
JasonClay_2010G BY COMPANIES ASKING FOR THIS WE CAN LEVERAGE PRODUCTION SO MUCH FASTER THAN BY WAITING FOR CONSUMERS TO DO IT
JasonClay_2010G AFTER FORTY YEARS THE GLOBAL ORGANIC MOVEMENT HAS ACHIEVED ZERO POINT SEVEN OF ONE PERCENT OF GLOBAL FOOD
JasonClay_2010G WE CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG
JasonClay_2010G WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME WE NEED CHANGE THAT'S GOING TO ACCELERATE
JasonClay_2010G EVEN WORKING WITH INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES IS NOT PROBABLY GOING TO GET US THERE WE NEED TO BEGIN TO WORK WITH
JasonClay_2010G INDUSTRIES SO WE'VE STARTED ROUNDTABLES WHERE WE BRING TOGETHER THE ENTIRE VALUE CHAIN FROM PRODUCERS ALL THE WAY TO THE RETAILERS AND BRANDS
JasonClay_2010G WE BRING IN CIVIL SOCIETY WE BRING IN NGOS WE BRING IN RESEARCHERS AND SCIENTISTS TO HAVE AN INFORMED DISCUSSION SOMETIMES A BATTLE ROYALE
JasonClay_2010G AND DESIGN STANDARDS AROUND THAT IT'S NOT ALL FUN AND GAMES
JasonClay_2010G IN SALMON AQUACULTURE WE KICKED OFF A ROUNDTABLE ALMOST SIX YEARS AGO
JasonClay_2010G EIGHT ENTITIES CAME TO THE TABLE
JasonClay_2010G WE EVENTUALLY GOT I THINK SIXTY PERCENT OF GLOBAL PRODUCTION AT THE TABLE AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF DEMAND AT THE TABLE THREE OF THE ORIGINAL EIGHT ENTITIES WERE SUING EACH OTHER
JasonClay_2010G AND YET NEXT WEEK WE LAUNCH GLOBALLY VERIFIED VETTED AND CERTIFIED STANDARDS FOR SALMON
JasonClay_2010G IT CAN HAPPEN
JasonClay_2010G SO WHAT BRINGS
JasonClay_2010G THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES TO THE TABLE
JasonClay_2010G FOR THE BIG COMPANIES IT'S REPUTATIONAL RISK BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY DON'T CARE WHAT THE PRICE OF COMMODITIES IS IF THEY DON'T HAVE COMMODITIES THEY DON'T HAVE A BUSINESS THEY CARE ABOUT AVAILABILITY SO THE BIG RISK FOR THEM IS NOT HAVING PRODUCT AT ALL
JasonClay_2010G FOR THE PRODUCERS IF A BUYER WANTS TO BUY SOMETHING PRODUCED A CERTAIN WAY THAT'S WHAT BRINGS THEM TO THE TABLE SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM TO THE TABLE
JasonClay_2010G THE GOOD NEWS IS WE IDENTIFIED A HUNDRED COMPANIES TWO YEARS AGO IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS WE'VE SIGNED AGREEMENTS WITH FORTY OF THOSE HUNDRED COMPANIES TO BEGIN TO WORK WITH THEM ON THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN AND IN THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS
JasonClay_2010G SIGNED UP TO WORK WITH ANOTHER FORTY AND WE THINK WE'LL GET THOSE SIGNED AS WELL NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS BRINGING THE CEOS OF THESE EIGHTY COMPANIES TOGETHER
JasonClay_2010G TO HELP TWIST THE ARMS OF THE FINAL TWENTY TO BRING THEM TO THE TABLE BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE NGOS THEY'VE NEVER WORKED WITH NGOS THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT
JasonClay_2010G BUT WE ALL NEED TO BE IN THIS TOGETHER SO WE'RE PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS WE'RE USING WHATEVER LEVERAGE WE HAVE TO BRING THEM TO THE TABLE ONE COMPANY WE'RE WORKING WITH THAT'S BEGUN IN BABY STEPS PERHAPS BUT HAS BEGUN THIS JOURNEY ON SUSTAINABILITY IS CARGILL
JasonClay_2010G FUNDED RESEARCH THAT SHOWS
JasonClay_2010G THAT WE CAN DOUBLE GLOBAL PALM OIL PRODUCTION WITHOUT CUTTING A SINGLE TREE IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS AND DO IT ALL IN BORNEO ALONE BY PLANTING ON LAND THAT'S ALREADY DEGRADED
JasonClay_2010G THE STUDY SHOWS THAT THE HIGHEST NET PRESENT VALUE FOR PALM OIL IS ON LAND THAT'S BEEN DEGRADED THEY'RE ALSO UNDERTAKING A STUDY TO LOOK AT ALL OF THEIR
JasonClay_2010G WHY IS CARGILL IMPORTANT BECAUSE CARGILL HAS TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF GLOBAL PALM OIL IF CARGILL MAKES A DECISION
JasonClay_2010G THE ENTIRE PALM OIL INDUSTRY MOVES OR AT LEAST FORTY OR FIFTY PERCENT OF IT THAT'S NOT INSIGNIFICANT MORE IMPORTANTLY
JasonClay_2010G BUT THEY'RE DOING SOME REALLY INTERESTING THINGS AROUND
JasonClay_2010G AND IT ALL COMES FROM THE FACT THAT MARS WANTS TO BE IN BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE
JasonClay_2010G AND WHAT THEY SEE IS THAT THEY NEED TO IMPROVE CHOCOLATE PRODUCTION ON ANY GIVEN PLANTATION
JasonClay_2010G SO MARS IS LOOKING AT THE GENOME THEY'RE SEQUENCING THE GENOME OF THE COCOA PLANT
JasonClay_2010G WHAT THEY'VE REALIZED IS THAT IF THEY CAN IDENTIFY THE TRAITS ON PRODUCTIVITY AND DROUGHT TOLERANCE THEY CAN PRODUCE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY PERCENT AS MUCH COCOA ON FORTY PERCENT OF THE
JasonClay_2010G THE REST OF THE LAND CAN BE USED FOR SOMETHING ELSE IT'S MORE WITH LESS AND LESS AGAIN THAT'S WHAT THE FUTURE HAS GOT TO BE
JasonClay_2010G NOW MANY PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT
JasonClay_2010G CONSUMERS ARE NOT PAYING FOR THE TRUE COST OF FOOD IF YOU TAKE A LOOK JUST AT WATER WHAT WE SEE IS THAT
JasonClay_2010G WITH FOUR VERY COMMON PRODUCTS YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH A FARMER PRODUCED TO MAKE THOSE PRODUCTS AND THEN YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH WATER INPUT WAS PUT INTO THEM
JasonClay_2010G AND THEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE FARMER WAS PAID IF YOU DIVIDE THE AMOUNT OF WATER INTO WHAT THE FARMER WAS PAID
JasonClay_2010G A LOT ON WATER BUT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ENTERING INTO SEVENTEEN YEAR CONTRACTS WITH GROWERS IN TURKEY TO SELL JUICE INTO EUROPE AND THEY'RE DOING THAT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HAVE A PRODUCT THAT'S CLOSER TO THE EUROPEAN MARKET
JasonClay_2010G THERE'S CARBON THAT'S BEING BOUGHT WITH SUGAR WITH COFFEE WITH BEEF THIS IS CALLED BUNDLING IT'S BRINGING THOSE EXTERNALITIES BACK INTO THE PRICE OF THE COMMODITY
JasonClay_2010G WE NEED TO TAKE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IN PRIVATE VOLUNTARY STANDARDS
JasonClay_2010G OF WHAT THE BEST PRODUCERS IN THE WORLD ARE DOING AND USE THAT TO INFORM GOVERNMENT REGULATION SO WE CAN SHIFT THE ENTIRE PERFORMANCE CURVE WE CAN'T JUST FOCUS ON IDENTIFYING THE BEST WE'VE GOT TO MOVE THE REST
JasonClay_2010G THE ISSUE ISN'T WHAT TO THINK IT'S HOW TO THINK THESE COMPANIES HAVE BEGUN TO THINK DIFFERENTLY THEY'RE ON A JOURNEY THERE'S NO TURNING BACK WE'RE ALL ON THAT SAME JOURNEY WITH THEM
JasonClay_2010G WE HAVE TO REALLY BEGIN TO CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING WHATEVER WAS SUSTAINABLE ON A PLANET OF SIX BILLION IS NOT GOING TO BE SUSTAINABLE ON A PLANET WITH NINE THANK YOU
