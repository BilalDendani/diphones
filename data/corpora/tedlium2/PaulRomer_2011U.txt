PaulRomer_2011U THOUSAND AND SEVEN I DECIDED THAT WE NEEDED TO RECONCEPTUALIZE HOW WE THOUGHT ABOUT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
PaulRomer_2011U OUR NEW GOAL SHOULD BE THAT WHEN EVERY FAMILY THINKS ABOUT WHERE THEY WANT TO LIVE AND WORK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN AT LEAST A HANDFUL OF DIFFERENT CITIES THAT WERE ALL COMPETING TO ATTRACT NEW RESIDENTS
PaulRomer_2011U NOW WE 'RE A LONG WAY AWAY FROM THAT GOAL RIGHT NOW THERE ARE BILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHO DON 'T HAVE EVEN A SINGLE CITY THAT WOULD BE WILLING TO WELCOME THEM BUT THE AMAZING THING ABOUT CITIES IS THEY 'RE WORTH SO MUCH MORE THAN IT COSTS TO BUILD THEM
PaulRomer_2011U SO WE COULD EASILY SUPPLY THE WORLD WITH DOZENS MAYBE HUNDREDS OF NEW CITIES
PaulRomer_2011U NOW THIS MIGHT SOUND PREPOSTEROUS TO YOU IF YOU 'VE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT NEW CITIES BUT JUST SUBSTITUTE APARTMENT BUILDING FOR CITIES IMAGINE HALF THE PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO BE IN APARTMENTS ALREADY HAD THEM THE OTHER HALF AREN 'T THERE YET
PaulRomer_2011U YOU COULD TRY AND EXPAND THE CAPACITY BY DOING ADDITIONS ON ALL THE EXISTING APARTMENTS
PaulRomer_2011U BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU 'D RUN INTO IS THOSE APARTMENTS AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS HAVE RULES TO AVOID DISCOMFORT AND THE DISTRACTIONS OF CONSTRUCTION SO IT 'S EXTREMELY HARD TO DO ALL OF THOSE ADDITIONS BUT YOU COULD GO OUT SOMEPLACE BRAND NEW
PaulRomer_2011U BUILD A BRAND NEW APARTMENT BUILDING AS LONG AS THE RULES THERE WERE ONES THAT FACILITATED CONSTRUCTION RATHER THAN GETTING IN THE WAY
PaulRomer_2011U SO I PROPOSED THAT GOVERNMENTS CREATE NEW REFORM ZONES BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD CITIES AND GAVE THEM A NAME CHARTER CITIES
PaulRomer_2011U LATER I LEARNED THAT AT ABOUT THIS SAME TIME JAVIER AND OCTAVIO WERE THINKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGE OF REFORM IN HONDURAS
PaulRomer_2011U THEY KNEW THAT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND HONDURANS EVERY YEAR WOULD LEAVE TO GO TO THE UNITED STATES AND THEY WANTED TO ASK WHAT COULD THEY DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE COULD STAY AND DO THE SAME THINGS IN HONDURAS AT ONE POINT JAVIER SAID TO OCTAVIO WHAT IF WE TOOK SOME OF OUR EMPTY LAND WHAT IF WE JUST GAVE IT TO AN EMBASSY
PaulRomer_2011U GIVE SOME TO THE U S EMBASSY GIVE SOME TO THE CANADIAN EMBASSY AND THEN IF PEOPLE WANT TO GO WORK UNDER THE RULES OF CANADA OR UNDER THE RULES OF THE UNITED STATES THEY CAN GO GET JOBS DO EVERYTHING THEY DO ON THOSE EMBASSY GROUNDS THAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TO GO TO CANADA OR THE U S TO DO
PaulRomer_2011U BUT RECONCILIATION AS WELL HE ASKED OCTAVIO TO BE HIS CHIEF OF STAFF
PaulRomer_2011U MEANWHILE I WAS GETTING READY TO GIVE A TALK AT TEDGLOBAL THROUGH A PROCESS OF REFINEMENT TRIAL AND ERROR A LOT OF USER TESTING I TRIED TO BOIL THIS COMPLICATED CONCEPT OF CHARTER CITY DOWN TO THE BARE ESSENTIALS
PaulRomer_2011U THE FIRST POINT WAS THE IMPORTANCE OF RULES LIKE THOSE RULES THAT SAY YOU CAN 'T COME IN AND DISTURB ALL THE EXISTING APARTMENT HOLDERS WE PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES BUT IT TAKES TECHNOLOGIES AND RULES TO GET PROGRESS AND IT 'S USUALLY THE RULES THAT HOLD US BACK
PaulRomer_2011U IN THE FALL
PaulRomer_2011U I TRIED TO EXPLAIN THIS POINT ABOUT HOW VALUABLE CITIES ARE HOW MUCH MORE VALUABLE THEY ARE THAN THEY COST AND I USED THIS SLIDE SHOWING HOW VALUABLE THE RAW LAND IS IN A PLACE LIKE NEW YORK CITY NOTICE LAND THAT 'S WORTH THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN SOME CASES PER SQUARE METER
PaulRomer_2011U BUT IT WAS A FAIRLY ABSTRACT DISCUSSION AND AT SOME POINT WHEN THERE WAS A PAUSE OCTAVIO SAID
PaulRomer_2011U PAUL MAYBE WE COULD WATCH THE TEDTALK
PaulRomer_2011U SO THE TEDTALK LAID OUT IN VERY SIMPLE TERMS A CHARTER CITY IS A PLACE WHERE YOU START WITH UNINHABITED LAND A CHARTER THAT SPECIFIES THE RULES THAT WILL APPLY THERE AND THEN A CHANCE FOR PEOPLE TO OPT IN TO GO LIVE UNDER THOSE RULES OR NOT
PaulRomer_2011U SO I WAS ASKED BY THE PRESIDENT OF HONDURAS WHO SAID THAT WE NEED TO DO THIS PROJECT THIS IS IMPORTANT THIS COULD BE THE WAY FORWARD FOR OUR COUNTRY I WAS ASKED TO COME TO TEGUCIGALPA AND TALK AGAIN ON JANUARY FOURTH AND FIFTH
PaulRomer_2011U SO I PRESENTED ANOTHER FACT FILLED LECTURE THAT INCLUDED A SLIDE LIKE THIS WHICH TRIED TO MAKE THE POINT THAT IF YOU WANT TO CREATE A LOT OF VALUE IN A CITY IT HAS TO BE VERY BIG
PaulRomer_2011U THIS IS A PICTURE OF DENVER AND THE OUTLINE IS THE NEW AIRPORT THAT WAS BUILT IN DENVER THIS AIRPORT ALONE COVERS MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED SQUARE KILOMETERS
PaulRomer_2011U SO I WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE THE HONDURANS IF YOU BUILD A NEW CITY YOU 'VE GOT TO START WITH A SITE THAT 'S AT LEAST ONE THOUSAND SQUARE KILOMETERS THAT 'S MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY HUNDRED THOUSAND
PaulRomer_2011U SO I SAT DOWN AND THEY PLAYED THE TEDTALK AND IT GOT TO THE ESSENCE WHICH IS THAT A NEW CITY COULD OFFER NEW CHOICES FOR PEOPLE THERE WOULD BE A CHOICE OF A CITY WHICH YOU COULD GO TO WHICH COULD BE IN HONDURAS INSTEAD OF HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY IN THE NORTH
PaulRomer_2011U AND IT ALSO INVOLVED NEW CHOICES FOR LEADERS BECAUSE THE LEADERS IN THE GOVERNMENT THERE IN HONDURAS WOULD NEED HELP FROM PARTNER COUNTRIES WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM PARTNER COUNTRIES WHO HELP THEM SET UP THE RULES IN THIS CHARTER AND THE ENFORCEMENT SO EVERYBODY CAN TRUST THAT
PaulRomer_2011U THE CHARTER REALLY WILL BE ENFORCED AND THE INSIGHT OF PRESIDENT LOBO WAS THAT THAT ASSURANCE OF ENFORCEMENT THAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT AS A WAY TO GET THE FOREIGN INVESTORS TO COME IN AND BUILD THE CITY COULD BE EQUALLY IMPORTANT FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTIES IN HONDURAS WHO HAD SUFFERED FOR SO MANY YEARS FROM FEAR AND DISTRUST
PaulRomer_2011U WE WENT AND LOOKED AT A SITE THIS PICTURE 'S FROM THERE IT EASILY COULD HOLD A THOUSAND SQUARE KILOMETERS
PaulRomer_2011U AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER ON JANUARY NINETEENTH THEY VOTED IN THE CONGRESS TO AMEND THEIR CONSTITUTION TO HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION THAT ALLOWS FOR SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT REGIONS IN A COUNTRY WHICH HAD JUST GONE THROUGH THIS WRENCHING CRISIS THE VOTE IN THE CONGRESS IN FAVOR OF THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WAS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR TO ONE
PaulRomer_2011U ALL PARTIES ALL FACTIONS IN SOCIETY BACKED THIS TO BE PART OF THE CONSTITUTION YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO PASS IT TWICE IN THE CONGRESS ON FEBRUARY SEVENTEENTH THEY PASSED IT AGAIN WITH ANOTHER VOTE OF ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN TO ONE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT VOTE
PaulRomer_2011U ONE IS SOUTH KOREA THIS IS A PICTURE OF A BIG NEW CITY CENTER THAT 'S BEING BUILT IN SOUTH KOREA BIGGER THAN DOWNTOWN BOSTON EVERYTHING YOU SEE THERE WAS BUILT IN FOUR YEARS AFTER THEY SPENT FOUR YEARS GETTING THE PERMITS
PaulRomer_2011U THE OTHER PLACE THAT 'S VERY INTERESTED IN CITY BUILDING IS SINGAPORE THEY 'VE ACTUALLY BUILT TWO CITIES ALREADY IN CHINA AND ARE PREPARING THE THIRD
PaulRomer_2011U SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS PRACTICALLY HERE 'S WHERE WE ARE THEY 'VE GOT A SITE THEY 'RE ALREADY THINKING ABOUT THIS SITE FOR THE SECOND CITY THEY 'RE PUTTING IN PLACE A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT COULD ALLOW FOR MANAGERS TO COME IN AND ALSO AN EXTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM ONE COUNTRY HAS ALREADY VOLUNTEERED TO LET ITS SUPREME COURT BE THE COURT OF FINAL APPEAL FOR THE NEW JUDICIAL SYSTEM THERE
PaulRomer_2011U THERE 'S DESIGNERS AND BUILDERS OF CITIES WHO ARE VERY INTERESTED THEY EVEN CAN BRING WITH THEM SOME FINANCING
PaulRomer_2011U BUT THE ONE THING YOU KNOW THEY 'VE ALREADY SOLVED IS THAT THERE 'S LOTS OF TENANTS
PaulRomer_2011U THERE 'S LOTS OF BUSINESSES THAT WOULD LIKE TO LOCATE IN THE AMERICAS ESPECIALLY IN A PLACE WITH A FREE TRADE ZONE AND THERE 'S LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO 'D LIKE TO GO THERE AROUND THE WORLD THERE 'S SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY 'D LIKE TO MOVE PERMANENTLY SOMEPLACE ELSE RIGHT NOW THERE 'S A MILLION A YEAR WHO LEAVE LATIN AMERICA TO GO TO THE UNITED STATES
PaulRomer_2011U MANY OF THESE ARE A FATHER WHO HAS TO LEAVE HIS FAMILY BEHIND TO GO GET A JOB SOMETIMES A SINGLE MOTHER WHO HAS TO GET ENOUGH MONEY TO EVEN PAY FOR FOOD OR CLOTHING SADLY SOMETIMES THERE ARE EVEN CHILDREN WHO ARE TRYING TO GET REUNITED WITH THEIR PARENTS THAT THEY HAVEN 'T SEEN IN SOME CASES FOR A DECADE
PaulRomer_2011U SO WHAT KIND OF AN IDEA IS IT TO THINK ABOUT BUILDING A BRAND NEW CITY IN HONDURAS OR TO BUILD A DOZEN OF THESE OR A HUNDRED OF THESE AROUND THE WORLD WHAT KIND OF AN IDEA IS IT TO THINK ABOUT INSISTING THAT EVERY FAMILY HAVE A CHOICE OF SEVERAL CITIES THAT ARE COMPETING TO ATTRACT
