LeeCronin_2012G CHEMISTRY NOW WHAT WOULD THIS MEAN AND HOW WOULD WE DO IT
LeeCronin_2012G WELL TO START TO DO THIS WE TOOK A THREE D PRINTER AND WE STARTED TO PRINT OUR BEAKERS AND OUR TEST TUBES ON ONE SIDE AND THEN PRINT THE MOLECULE AT THE SAME TIME ON THE OTHER SIDE AND COMBINE THEM TOGETHER IN WHAT WE CALL REACTIONWARE AND SO BY PRINTING THE VESSEL
LeeCronin_2012G AND DOING THE CHEMISTRY AT THE SAME TIME WE MAY START TO ACCESS THIS UNIVERSAL TOOLKIT OF CHEMISTRY
LeeCronin_2012G BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL NETWORKS LIKE A SEARCH ENGINE SO IF YOU HAVE A CELL THAT 'S ILL THAT YOU NEED TO CURE OR BACTERIA THAT YOU WANT TO KILL IF YOU HAVE THIS EMBEDDED IN YOUR DEVICE AT THE SAME TIME AND YOU DO THE CHEMISTRY YOU MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE DRUGS IN A NEW WAY
LeeCronin_2012G SO HOW ARE WE DOING THIS IN THE LAB WELL IT REQUIRES SOFTWARE
LeeCronin_2012G IT REQUIRES HARDWARE AND IT REQUIRES CHEMICAL INKS AND SO THE REALLY COOL BIT IS THE IDEA IS THAT WE WANT TO HAVE A UNIVERSAL SET OF INKS THAT WE PUT OUT WITH THE PRINTER AND YOU DOWNLOAD THE BLUEPRINT THE ORGANIC CHEMISTRY FOR THAT MOLECULE AND YOU MAKE IT IN THE DEVICE
LeeCronin_2012G AND SO YOU CAN MAKE YOUR MOLECULE IN THE PRINTER USING THIS SOFTWARE
LeeCronin_2012G SO WHAT COULD THIS MEAN WELL ULTIMATELY IT COULD MEAN THAT YOU COULD PRINT YOUR OWN MEDICINE
LeeCronin_2012G AND THIS IS WHAT WE 'RE DOING IN THE LAB AT THE MOMENT BUT TO TAKE BABY STEPS TO GET THERE FIRST OF ALL WE WANT TO LOOK AT DRUG DESIGN AND PRODUCTION OR DRUG DISCOVERY AND MANUFACTURING BECAUSE IF WE CAN MANUFACTURE IT AFTER WE 'VE DISCOVERED IT WE COULD DEPLOY IT ANYWHERE YOU DON 'T NEED TO GO TO THE CHEMIST ANYMORE
LeeCronin_2012G SO THIS ALLOWS YOU ON THE FLY MOLECULAR ASSEMBLY BUT PERHAPS FOR ME THE CORE BIT GOING INTO THE FUTURE IS THIS IDEA OF TAKING YOUR OWN STEM CELLS WITH YOUR GENES AND YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND YOU PRINT YOUR OWN PERSONAL MEDICINE AND IF THAT DOESN 'T SEEM FANCIFUL ENOUGH
LeeCronin_2012G WHERE DO YOU THINK WE 'RE GOING TO GO WELL
LeeCronin_2012G YOU 'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR OWN PERSONAL
LeeCronin_2012G MATTER FABRICATOR BEAM ME UP SCOTTY
