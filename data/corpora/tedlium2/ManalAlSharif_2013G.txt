ManalAlSharif_2013G@157.86:160.99 IT ALL HIT ME
ManalAlSharif_2013G@160.99:169.4 IT CAME INTO FOCUS THAT THOSE KIDS DID NOT MEAN TO BE RUDE TO MY SON THEY WERE JUST INFLUENCED BY THE ADULTS AROUND THEM
ManalAlSharif_2013G@169.4:181.24 AND IT WASN 'T ABOUT ME AND IT WASN 'T A PUNISHMENT FOR TAKING THE WHEEL AND DRIVING A FEW MILES IT WAS A PUNISHMENT FOR DARING TO CHALLENGE THE SOCIETY 'S RULES

ManalAlSharif_2013G@461.11:468.17 SO THEY NEED TO TAKE PERMISSION FROM THIS GUARDIAN WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN ALL THEIR LIVES WE ARE MINORS UNTIL THE DAY WE DIE
ManalAlSharif_2013G@476.44:487.43 WHAT 'S WORST WHEN THEY BECOME CODIFIED AS LAWS IN THE SYSTEM AND WHEN WOMEN THEMSELVES BELIEVE IN THEIR INFERIORITY AND THEY EVEN FIGHT THOSE WHO TRY
ManalAlSharif_2013G@487.45:506.02 TO QUESTION THESE RULES SO FOR ME IT WASN 'T ONLY ABOUT THESE ATTACKS I HAD TO FACE IT WAS ABOUT LIVING TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERCEPTIONS OF MY PERSONALITY OF MY PERSON THE VILLAIN BACK IN MY HOME COUNTRY AND THE HERO OUTSIDE
ManalAlSharif_2013G@520.13:531.85 DURING THESE NINE DAYS I WAS IN JAIL BUT IN MY HOME COUNTRY IT WAS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PICTURE IT WAS MORE LIKE THIS MANAL AL SHARIF FACES CHARGES OF DISTURBING PUBLIC ORDER AND
