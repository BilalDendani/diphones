BreneBrown_2012@21.01:23.74 I WOKE UP THE MORNING AFTER I GAVE THAT TALK
BreneBrown_2012@24.55:27.28 WITH THE WORST VULNERABILITY HANGOVER
BreneBrown_2012@35.22:37.39 THE FIRST TIME I LEFT WAS TO MEET A FRIEND
BreneBrown_2012@57.13:64.34 THAT I BECAME A RESEARCHER TO AVOID VULNERABILITY AND THAT WHEN BEING VULNERABLE EMERGED FROM MY DATA
BreneBrown_2012@65.56:68.89 AS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO WHOLE HEARTED LIVING
BreneBrown_2012@69.8:73.26 I TOLD THESE FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT I HAD A BREAKDOWN
BreneBrown_2012@121.23:125.04 THEN WE 'D HAVE TO BREAK INTO HIS DORM ROOM AND THEN ERASE THE TAPE
BreneBrown_2012@140.8:142.46 'M THINKING TO MYSELF
BreneBrown_2012@152.82:154.37 SO I LOOKED BACK UP AND SHE SAID
BreneBrown_2012@155.89:159.1 ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO TRY TO BREAK IN
BreneBrown_2012@159.48:162.29 AND STEAL THE VIDEO BEFORE THEY PUT IT ON YOUTUBE
BreneBrown_2012@183.93:186.96 IF FIVE HUNDRED TURNS INTO ONE THOUSAND
BreneBrown_2012@194:197.34 I HAD NO CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR FOUR MILLION
BreneBrown_2012@203.98:209.73 AND MAYBE THE HARDEST PART ABOUT MY LIFE ENDING IS THAT I
BreneBrown_2012@224.75:226.49 STAYING RIGHT UNDER THE RADAR
BreneBrown_2012@228.98:233.99 BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I 'VE LEARNED THERE 'S TWO THINGS THAT I 'VE LEARNED IN THE LAST YEAR
BreneBrown_2012@242.44:244.14 AND THAT MYTH
BreneBrown_2012@257.97:263.86 HOW MANY OF YOU HONESTLY WHEN YOU 'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING SOMETHING VULNERABLE OR SAYING SOMETHING VULNERABLE
BreneBrown_2012@263.91:269.43 THINK GOD VULNERABILITY 'S WEAKNESS THIS IS WEAKNESS HOW MANY OF YOU THINK OF VULNERABILITY AND WEAKNESS SYNONYMOUSLY
BreneBrown_2012@283.98:285.57 VULNERABILITY IS NOT WEAKNESS
BreneBrown_2012@289.42:291.04 EMOTIONAL RISK
BreneBrown_2012@291.37:293.85 EXPOSURE UNCERTAINTY
BreneBrown_2012@294.6:296.65 IT FUELS OUR DAILY LIVES
BreneBrown_2012@300.57:304.34 THAT VULNERABILITY IS OUR MOST ACCURATE
BreneBrown_2012@304.97:307.38 MEASUREMENT OF COURAGE
BreneBrown_2012@309.13:312.79 TO BE VULNERABLE TO LET OURSELVES BE SEEN TO BE HONEST
BreneBrown_2012@313.88:331.98 ONE OF THE WEIRD THINGS THAT 'S HAPPENED IS AFTER THE TED EXPLOSION I GOT A LOT OF OFFERS TO SPEAK ALL OVER THE COUNTRY EVERYONE FROM SCHOOLS AND PARENT MEETINGS TO FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES AND SO MANY OF THE CALLS WENT LIKE THIS HEY DR BROWN WE LOVED YOUR TEDTALK WE 'D LIKE YOU TO COME IN AND SPEAK
BreneBrown_2012@332.69:336.47 WE 'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULDN 'T MENTION VULNERABILITY OR SHAME
BreneBrown_2012@345.27:353.31 THERE 'S THREE BIG ANSWERS THIS IS MOSTLY TO BE HONEST WITH YOU FROM THE BUSINESS SECTOR INNOVATION CREATIVITY AND CHANGE
BreneBrown_2012@355.68:357.26 SO LET ME GO ON THE RECORD
BreneBrown_2012@378.85:381.13 THERE 'S NOTHING MORE VULNERABLE THAN THAT
BreneBrown_2012@381.91:385.26 ADAPTABILITY TO CHANGE IS ALL ABOUT VULNERABILITY
BreneBrown_2012@386.64:391.1 THE SECOND THING IN ADDITION TO REALLY FINALLY UNDERSTANDING
BreneBrown_2012@391.54:395.51 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VULNERABILITY AND COURAGE THE SECOND THING I LEARNED IS THIS
BreneBrown_2012@397.12:399.15 WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT SHAME
BreneBrown_2012@401.6:403.78 AND I 'M GOING TO BE REALLY HONEST WITH YOU
BreneBrown_2012@407.6:414.09 AND THAT BECAME THE FOCUS BECAUSE OF THE TEDTALK AND I 'M NOT KIDDING I 'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE ABOUT
BreneBrown_2012@414.33:423.42 THREE MONTHS AGO I WAS IN A SPORTING GOODS STORE BUYING GOGGLES AND SHIN GUARDS AND ALL THE THINGS THAT PARENTS BUY AT THE SPORTING GOODS STORE ABOUT FROM A HUNDRED
BreneBrown_2012@423.42:427.34 FEET AWAY THIS IS WHAT I HEAR VULNERABILITY TED VULNERABILITY TED
BreneBrown_2012@437.76:444.81 OUR FAMILY MOTTO IS LOCK AND LOAD I AM NOT A NATURAL VULNERABILITY RESEARCHER
BreneBrown_2012@461.01:463.69 YOU 'RE THE SHAME RESEARCHER WHO HAD THE BREAKDOWN
BreneBrown_2012@488.62:490.57 AND SHE LOOKS BACK AND DOES THIS
BreneBrown_2012@495.4:497.88 WE WATCHED YOUR TEDTALK IN MY BOOK
BreneBrown_2012@497.94:503.6 THEN WE READ YOUR BOOK AND WE RENAMED OURSELVES THE BREAKDOWN BABES
BreneBrown_2012@505.11:509.24 SHE SAID OUR TAGLINE IS WE 'RE FALLING APART AND IT FEELS
BreneBrown_2012@526.05:528.26 LIKE NINJA BARBIE BUT I 'M VULNERABILITY TED
BreneBrown_2012@530.23:547.69 I THOUGHT I 'M GOING TO LEAVE THAT SHAME STUFF BEHIND BECAUSE I SPENT SIX YEARS STUDYING SHAME BEFORE I REALLY STARTED WRITING AND TALKING ABOUT VULNERABILITY AND I THOUGHT THANK GOD BECAUSE SHAME IS THIS HORRIBLE TOPIC NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT IT 'S THE BEST WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN ON AN AIRPLANE WHAT DO YOU DO I STUDY SHAME
BreneBrown_2012@561.38:565.78 I WAS REMINDED OF A CARDINAL RULE NOT A RESEARCH RULE
BreneBrown_2012@566.15:568.78 BUT A MORAL IMPERATIVE
BreneBrown_2012@574.4:579.94 AND I DID NOT LEARN ABOUT VULNERABILITY AND COURAGE AND CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION
BreneBrown_2012@580.08:582.64 FROM STUDYING VULNERABILITY
BreneBrown_2012@582.83:585.88 I LEARNED ABOUT THESE THINGS FROM STUDYING SHAME
BreneBrown_2012@586.72:590.04 AND SO I WANT TO WALK YOU IN TO SHAME
BreneBrown_2012@593.44:595.29 THE SWAMPLAND OF THE SOUL
BreneBrown_2012@596.72:602.73 AND WE 'RE GOING TO WALK IN AND THE PURPOSE IS NOT TO WALK IN AND CONSTRUCT A HOME AND LIVE THERE
BreneBrown_2012@603.28:605.52 IT IS TO PUT ON SOME GALOSHES
BreneBrown_2012@606.98:609.28 AND WALK THROUGH AND FIND OUR WAY AROUND
BreneBrown_2012@631.97:639.04 BECAUSE YOU CANNOT TALK ABOUT RACE WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT PRIVILEGE AND WHEN PEOPLE START TALKING ABOUT PRIVILEGE THEY GET PARALYZED BY SHAME
BreneBrown_2012@639.93:642.36 WE HEARD A BRILLIANT SIMPLE SOLUTION
BreneBrown_2012@642.54:645.36 TO NOT KILLING PEOPLE IN SURGERY WHICH IS HAVE A CHECKLIST
BreneBrown_2012@646.35:651.52 YOU CAN 'T FIX THAT PROBLEM WITHOUT ADDRESSING SHAME BECAUSE WHEN THEY TEACH THOSE FOLKS HOW TO SUTURE
BreneBrown_2012@651.81:655.02 THEY ALSO TEACH THEM HOW TO STITCH THEIR SELF WORTH
BreneBrown_2012@655.57:657.12 TO BEING ALL POWERFUL
BreneBrown_2012@657.64:659.62 AND ALL POWERFUL FOLKS DON 'T NEED
BreneBrown_2012@667.41:669.01 MYSHKIN INGAWALE
BreneBrown_2012@684.12:693.17 AND HE SAID I SAW THIS NEED SO YOU KNOW WHAT I DID I MADE IT AND EVERYBODY JUST BURST INTO APPLAUSE AND THEY WERE LIKE YES AND HE SAID AND IT DIDN 'T WORK
BreneBrown_2012@693.62:697.1 AND THEN I MADE IT THIRTY TWO MORE TIMES
BreneBrown_2012@718.2:720.94 BECAUSE VERY FEW PEOPLE HERE ARE AFRAID TO FAIL
BreneBrown_2012@722.27:725.68 AND NO ONE WHO GETS ON THE STAGE SO FAR THAT I 'VE SEEN HAS NOT FAILED
BreneBrown_2012@731.45:733.17 BECAUSE OF SHAME
BreneBrown_2012@733.85:737.63 THERE 'S A GREAT QUOTE THAT SAVED ME THIS PAST YEAR BY THEODORE ROOSEVELT
BreneBrown_2012@737.68:741.14 A LOT OF PEOPLE REFER TO IT AS THE MAN IN THE ARENA QUOTE
BreneBrown_2012@756.23:759.45 WHOSE FACE IS MARRED WITH DUST AND BLOOD
BreneBrown_2012@768.59:772.79 BUT WHEN HE FAILS WHEN HE LOSES HE DOES SO DARING GREATLY
BreneBrown_2012@774.25:776.64 AND THAT 'S WHAT THIS CONFERENCE TO ME IS ABOUT
BreneBrown_2012@777.05:785.9 THAT 'S WHAT LIFE IS ABOUT ABOUT DARING GREATLY ABOUT BEING IN THE ARENA WHEN YOU WALK UP TO THAT ARENA AND YOU PUT YOUR HAND ON THE DOOR AND YOU THINK I 'M GOING IN AND I 'M GOING TO TRY THIS
BreneBrown_2012@786.18:789.91 SHAME IS THE GREMLIN WHO SAYS
BreneBrown_2012@794.99:798.21 I KNOW YOUR DAD REALLY WASN 'T IN LUXEMBOURG HE WAS IN SING SING
BreneBrown_2012@804.18:808.33 I KNOW YOU DON 'T THINK THAT YOU 'RE PRETTY ENOUGH OR SMART ENOUGH OR TALENTED ENOUGH OR POWERFUL ENOUGH
BreneBrown_2012@819.05:820.68 AND SAY I 'M GOING TO DO THIS
BreneBrown_2012@837.09:839.08 AND IF YOU CAN TALK IT OUT OF THAT ONE
BreneBrown_2012@845.27:851.62 SHAME IS A FOCUS ON SELF GUILT IS A FOCUS ON BEHAVIOR SHAME IS I AM BAD GUILT IS I DID SOMETHING BAD
BreneBrown_2012@853.06:861.14 HOW MANY OF YOU IF YOU DID SOMETHING THAT WAS HURTFUL TO ME WOULD BE WILLING TO SAY I 'M SORRY I MADE A MISTAKE HOW MANY OF YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO SAY THAT
BreneBrown_2012@861.79:867.95 GUILT I 'M SORRY I MADE A MISTAKE SHAME I 'M SORRY I AM A MISTAKE
BreneBrown_2012@873.06:881.81 SHAME IS HIGHLY HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH ADDICTION DEPRESSION VIOLENCE AGGRESSION BULLYING SUICIDE EATING DISORDERS
BreneBrown_2012@889.73:899.21 THE ABILITY TO HOLD SOMETHING WE 'VE DONE OR FAILED TO DO UP AGAINST WHO WE WANT TO BE IS INCREDIBLY ADAPTIVE IT 'S UNCOMFORTABLE BUT IT 'S ADAPTIVE
BreneBrown_2012@902.7:907.62 THE OTHER THING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT SHAME IS IT 'S ABSOLUTELY ORGANIZED BY GENDER
BreneBrown_2012@908.31:911.04 IF SHAME WASHES OVER ME AND WASHES OVER CHRIS
BreneBrown_2012@911.27:912.9 IT 'S GOING TO FEEL THE SAME
BreneBrown_2012@913.44:916.32 EVERYONE SITTING IN HERE KNOWS THE WARM WASH OF SHAME
BreneBrown_2012@916.93:922.3 WE 'RE PRETTY SURE THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO DON 'T EXPERIENCE SHAME ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO CAPACITY FOR CONNECTION OR EMPATHY
BreneBrown_2012@923.25:926.6 WHICH MEANS YES I HAVE A LITTLE SHAME NO I 'M A SOCIOPATH
BreneBrown_2012@926.63:929.31 SO I WOULD OPT FOR YES YOU HAVE A LITTLE SHAME
BreneBrown_2012@932.68:936.45 SHAME FEELS THE SAME FOR MEN AND WOMEN BUT IT 'S ORGANIZED BY GENDER
BreneBrown_2012@963.23:971.05 I DON 'T KNOW HOW MUCH PERFUME THAT COMMERCIAL SOLD BUT I GUARANTEE YOU IT MOVED A LOT OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND ANTI ANXIETY MEDS
BreneBrown_2012@979.51:982.95 CONFLICTING COMPETING EXPECTATIONS ABOUT WHO WE 'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
BreneBrown_2012@984.61:986.12 AND IT 'S A STRAIGHT JACKET
BreneBrown_2012@986.97:991.57 FOR MEN SHAME IS NOT A BUNCH OF COMPETING CONFLICTING EXPECTATIONS
BreneBrown_2012@1010.42:1012.21 AND HE SAID THAT 'S CONVENIENT
BreneBrown_2012@1019.33:1021.89 YOU SAY TO REACH OUT TELL OUR STORY
BreneBrown_2012@1049.16:1051.91 BECAUSE THE WOMEN IN MY LIFE ARE HARDER ON ME THAN ANYONE ELSE
BreneBrown_2012@1053.56:1056.49 SO I STARTED INTERVIEWING MEN AND ASKING QUESTIONS
BreneBrown_2012@1056.77:1058.7 AND WHAT I LEARNED IS THIS
BreneBrown_2012@1059.73:1063.88 YOU SHOW ME A WOMAN WHO CAN ACTUALLY SIT WITH A MAN IN REAL VULNERABILITY AND FEAR
BreneBrown_2012@1064.11:1066.7 I 'LL SHOW YOU A WOMAN WHO 'S DONE INCREDIBLE WORK
BreneBrown_2012@1067.56:1069.73 YOU SHOW ME A MAN WHO CAN SIT WITH A WOMAN
BreneBrown_2012@1071.79:1074.11 CAN 'T DO IT ALL ANYMORE
BreneBrown_2012@1075.34:1079.14 AND HIS FIRST RESPONSE IS NOT I UNLOADED THE DISHWASHER
BreneBrown_2012@1080.52:1082.65 BUT HE REALLY LISTENS
BreneBrown_2012@1087.12:1088.95 SHAME IS AN EPIDEMIC
BreneBrown_2012@1096.56:1106.74 TO FIND OUR WAY BACK TO EACH OTHER WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT AFFECTS US AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE WAY WE 'RE PARENTING THE WAY WE 'RE WORKING THE WAY WE 'RE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER
BreneBrown_2012@1107.97:1111.25 VERY QUICKLY SOME RESEARCH BY MAHALIK AT BOSTON COLLEGE
BreneBrown_2012@1111.36:1117.18 HE ASKED WHAT DO WOMEN NEED TO DO TO CONFORM TO FEMALE NORMS THE TOP ANSWERS IN THIS COUNTRY
BreneBrown_2012@1118.68:1122.68 NICE THIN MODEST AND USE ALL AVAILABLE RESOURCES FOR APPEARANCE
BreneBrown_2012@1124.22:1131.17 WHEN HE ASKED ABOUT MEN WHAT DO MEN IN THIS COUNTRY NEED TO DO TO CONFORM WITH MALE NORMS THE ANSWERS WERE
BreneBrown_2012@1131.64:1133.55 ALWAYS SHOW EMOTIONAL CONTROL
BreneBrown_2012@1133.6:1135.11 WORK IS FIRST
BreneBrown_2012@1142.23:1145.31 AND KNOW EMPATHY BECAUSE EMPATHY 'S THE ANTIDOTE TO SHAME
BreneBrown_2012@1145.73:1148.03 IF YOU PUT SHAME IN A PETRI DISH
BreneBrown_2012@1148.06:1152.29 IT NEEDS THREE THINGS TO GROW EXPONENTIALLY SECRECY SILENCE AND JUDGMENT
BreneBrown_2012@1152.83:1157.03 IF YOU PUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF SHAME IN A PETRI DISH AND DOUSE IT WITH EMPATHY IT CAN 'T SURVIVE
BreneBrown_2012@1157.52:1161.86 THE TWO MOST POWERFUL WORDS WHEN WE 'RE IN STRUGGLE ME TOO
BreneBrown_2012@1162.77:1165.11 AND SO I 'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS THOUGHT
BreneBrown_2012@1166.1:1169.68 IF WE 'RE GOING TO FIND OUR WAY BACK TO EACH OTHER
BreneBrown_2012@1170.52:1172.88 VULNERABILITY IS GOING TO BE THAT
BreneBrown_2012@1174.47:1178.8 AND I KNOW IT 'S SEDUCTIVE TO STAND OUTSIDE THE ARENA BECAUSE I THINK I DID IT MY WHOLE LIFE
BreneBrown_2012@1182.72:1185.2 WHEN I 'M BULLETPROOF AND WHEN I 'M PERFECT
BreneBrown_2012@1187.25:1189.95 AND THAT IS SEDUCTIVE BUT THE TRUTH IS
BreneBrown_2012@1196.78:1199.56 WHEN YOU GOT IN THERE THAT 'S NOT WHAT WE WANT TO SEE
BreneBrown_2012@1201.92:1203.65 WE WANT YOU TO GO IN
BreneBrown_2012@1204.85:1207.36 WE WANT TO BE WITH YOU AND ACROSS FROM YOU
BreneBrown_2012@1208.23:1209.76 AND WE JUST WANT
BreneBrown_2012@1210.13:1213.65 FOR OURSELVES AND THE PEOPLE WE CARE ABOUT AND THE PEOPLE WE WORK WITH
