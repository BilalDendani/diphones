AntonyGormley_2012G@17.54:19.54 WHY I BECAME A SCULPTOR
AntonyGormley_2012G@24.82:31.43 THEY DEAL WITH OBJECTS THEY DEAL WITH BODIES BUT I THINK
AntonyGormley_2012G@38.48:52.49 MAKING SPACE SPACE THAT EXISTS WITHIN US AND WITHOUT US SO WHEN I WAS A CHILD
AntonyGormley_2012G@52.49:59.53 I DON 'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU GREW UP IN THE FIFTY S BUT I WAS SENT UPSTAIRS FOR AN ENFORCED REST
AntonyGormley_2012G@71.46:86.9 HOT SMALL AND LIGHT AND I HAD TO LIE THERE IT WAS RIDICULOUS BUT ANYWAY FOR SOME REASON I PROMISED MYSELF THAT I WASN 'T GOING TO MOVE THAT I WAS GOING TO DO THIS THING THAT MUMMY WANTED ME TO DO
AntonyGormley_2012G@86.9:96.25 AND THERE I WAS LYING THERE IN THIS TINY SPACE HOT DARK CLAUSTROPHOBIC MATCHBOX SIZED BEHIND MY EYES
AntonyGormley_2012G@96.25:100.02 BUT IT WAS REALLY WEIRD LIKE
AntonyGormley_2012G@100.16:111.49 AFTER THIS WENT ON FOR DAYS WEEKS MONTHS THAT SPACE WOULD GET BIGGER AND DARKER
AntonyGormley_2012G@143.11:145.58 HERE WE ARE
AntonyGormley_2012G@145.74:158.64 IN A SPACE THE SUBJECTIVE COLLECTIVE SPACE OF THE DARKNESS OF THE BODY I THINK OF THIS AS THE PLACE OF IMAGINATION
AntonyGormley_2012G@198.29:208.4 CAN CONNECT US WITH SO IMAGINE WE 'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF AMERICA YOU 'RE ASLEEP YOU WAKE UP
AntonyGormley_2012G@208.49:216.94 AND WITHOUT LIFTING YOUR HEAD FROM THE EARTH ON YOUR SLEEPING BAG YOU CAN SEE FOR SEVENTY MILES
AntonyGormley_2012G@216.94:220.48 THIS IS A DRY LAKE
AntonyGormley_2012G@229.98:243.7 DIRECTLY WITH PLACE THIS WAS A WONDERFUL PLACE BECAUSE IT WAS A PLACE WHERE YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON TO BE THERE IT WAS A PLACE WHERE NOTHING VERY MUCH HAD HAPPENED
AntonyGormley_2012G@243.7:246 ANYWAY
AntonyGormley_2012G@269.43:274.96 I STOOD ON THE PILE AND THREW ALL OF THOSE ROCKS OUT AGAIN
AntonyGormley_2012G@274.96:281.41 AND HERE IS REARRANGED DESERT
AntonyGormley_2012G@307.9:318.12 ROCKS THAT HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF GEOLOGICAL FORMATION EROSION THE ACTION OF TIME ON OBJECTS
AntonyGormley_2012G@318.12:329.73 THIS IS A PLACE IN A WAY THAT I JUST WOULD LIKE YOU TO IN A WAY LOOK AT DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF THIS EVENT THAT HAS HAPPENED IN IT A HUMAN EVENT
AntonyGormley_2012G@329.73:345.09 AND IN GENERAL IT JUST ASKS US TO LOOK AGAIN AT THIS WORLD SO DIFFERENT FROM IN A WAY THE WORLD THAT WE HAVE BEEN SHARING WITH EACH OTHER THE TECHNOLOGICAL WORLD TO LOOK AGAIN AT THE ELEMENTAL
AntonyGormley_2012G@345.09:358.17 WORLD THE ELEMENTAL WORLD THAT WE ALL LIVE IN IS THAT SPACE THAT WE ALL VISITED TOGETHER THE DARKNESS OF THE BODY
AntonyGormley_2012G@358.17:369.92 I WANTED TO START AGAIN WITH THAT ENVIRONMENT THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE INTIMATE SUBJECTIVE SPACE THAT EACH OF US LIVES IN BUT FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF APPEARANCE
AntonyGormley_2012G@369.92:383.74 SO HERE IS A DAILY ACTIVITY OF THE STUDIO YOU CAN SEE I DON 'T DO MUCH I 'M JUST STANDING THERE AGAIN WITH MY EYES CLOSED AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE MOLDING ME EVIDENTIAL
AntonyGormley_2012G@383.74:390.2 THIS IS AN INDEXICAL REGISTER OF A LIVED MOMENT OF A BODY IN TIME
AntonyGormley_2012G@390.2:398.22 CAN WE MAP THAT SPACE USING THE LANGUAGE OF NEUTRINOS OR COSMIC RAYS
AntonyGormley_2012G@398.22:417.99 TAKING THE BOUNDING CONDITION OF THE BODY AS ITS LIMIT BUT IN COMPLETE REVERSAL OF IN A WAY THE MOST TRADITIONAL GREEK IDEA OF POINTING IN THE OLD DAYS THEY USED TO TAKE A LUMP OF PENTELIC MARBLE AND DRILL FROM THE SURFACE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE SKIN
AntonyGormley_2012G@417.99:430.57 THE APPEARANCE WHAT ARISTOTLE DEFINED AS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUBSTANCE AND APPEARANCE THE THING THAT MAKES THINGS VISIBLE BUT HERE WE 'RE WORKING FROM THE OTHER SIDE
AntonyGormley_2012G@430.57:446.86 OR CAN WE DO IT AS AN EXCLUSIVE MEMBRANE THIS IS A LEAD CASE MADE AROUND THE SPACE THAT MY BODY OCCUPIED BUT IT 'S NOW VOID THIS IS A WORK CALLED LEARNING TO SEE
AntonyGormley_2012G@446.86:451.25 IT
AntonyGormley_2012G@451.25:461.94 WELL WE COULD CALL IT NIGHT WE COULD CALL IT THE NINETY SIX PERCENT OF GRAVITY THAT WE DON 'T KNOW ABOUT DARK MATTER
AntonyGormley_2012G@474.73:489.42 IT 'S CALLED LEARNING TO SEE BECAUSE IT 'S ABOUT AN OBJECT THAT HOPEFULLY WORKS REFLEXIVELY AND TALKS ABOUT THAT VISION OR CONNECTION WITH THE DARKNESS OF THE BODY THAT I SEE AS A SPACE OF POTENTIAL
AntonyGormley_2012G@492.02:508.89 CAN WE DO IT ANOTHER WAY USING THE LANGUAGE OF PARTICLES AROUND A NUCLEUS AND TALK ABOUT THE BODY AS AN ENERGY CENTER NO LONGER ABOUT STATUES NO LONGER HAVING TO TAKE THAT DUTY OF STANDING THE STANDING OF A HUMAN BODY OR THE STANDING OF A STATUE RELEASE IT
AntonyGormley_2012G@508.89:517.14 ALLOW IT TO BE AN ENERGY FIELD A SPACE IN SPACE THAT TALKS ABOUT HUMAN LIFE
AntonyGormley_2012G@517.14:524.95 BETWEEN BECOMING AN ENTROPY AS A SORT OF CONCENTRATION OF ATTENTION
AntonyGormley_2012G@524.96:533.6 A HUMAN PLACE OF POSSIBILITY IN SPACE AT LARGE IS THERE ANOTHER WAY
AntonyGormley_2012G@549.65:564 DO THEY ALSO HAVE A FINAL SKIN AND IS THAT SKIN PERCEPTUAL THE HORIZON AND IS ART ABOUT TRYING TO IMAGINE WHAT LIES BEYOND THE HORIZON
AntonyGormley_2012G@566.71:578 CAN WE USE IN A WAY A BODY AS AN EMPTY CATALYST FOR A KIND OF EMPATHY WITH
AntonyGormley_2012G@578:587 THE EXPERIENCE OF SPACE TIME AS IT IS LIVED AS I AM STANDING HERE IN FRONT OF YOU
AntonyGormley_2012G@587.39:606.43 TRYING TO FEEL AND MAKE A CONNECTION IN THIS SPACE TIME THAT WE ARE SHARING CAN WE USE AT IT WERE THE MEMORY OF A BODY OF A HUMAN SPACE IN SPACE TO CATALYZE AN EXPERIENCE AGAIN FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE OF ELEMENTAL TIME
AntonyGormley_2012G@606.43:622.18 HUMAN TIME INDUSTRIAL TIME TESTED AGAINST THE TIME OF THE TIDES IN WHICH THESE MEMORIES OF A PARTICULAR BODY THAT COULD BE ANY BODY MULTIPLIED AS IN THE TIME
AntonyGormley_2012G@622.18:628.99 MECHANICAL REPRODUCTION MANY TIMES PLACED OVER THREE SQUARE MILES
AntonyGormley_2012G@628.99:648.82 A MILE OUT TO SEA DISAPPEARING IN DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OF DAY AND NIGHT YOU CAN SEE THIS WORK IT 'S ON THE MOUTH OF THE MERSEY JUST OUTSIDE LIVERPOOL AND THERE YOU CAN SEE WHAT A LIVERPOOL SEA LOOKS LIKE ON A TYPICAL AFTERNOON
AntonyGormley_2012G@648.82:660.47 THE PIECES APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR BUT MAYBE MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS IS JUST LOOKING NORTH FROM THE CENTER OF THE INSTALLATION THEY CREATE A FIELD
AntonyGormley_2012G@660.47:676.1 A FIELD THAT INVOLVES LIVING AND THE SURROGATE BODIES IN A KIND OF RELATION A RELATION WITH EACH OTHER AND A RELATION WITH THAT LIMIT THE EDGE THE HORIZON
AntonyGormley_2012G@685.52:696.78 SUPPLANT THE FIRST BODY THE BIOLOGICAL BODY WITH THE SECOND THE BODY OF ARCHITECTURE AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT THIS IS A WORK CALLED ROOM FOR THE GREAT AUSTRALIAN DESERT
AntonyGormley_2012G@696.78:706.71 IT 'S IN AN UNDEFINED LOCATION AND I 'VE NEVER PUBLISHED WHERE IT IS IT 'S AN OBJECT FOR THE MIND I THINK OF IT AS A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BUDDHA
AntonyGormley_2012G@725.37:738.53 IT 'S TWO AND A HALF INCHES THICK CONCRETE WITH A VOID INTERIOR AGAIN A SITE FOUND WITH A COMPLETELY FLAT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DEGREE HORIZON
AntonyGormley_2012G@738.53:755.06 THIS IS JUST SIMPLY ASKING AGAIN AS IF WE HAD ARRIVED FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE HUMAN PROJECT TO TIME AND SPACE
AntonyGormley_2012G@755.06:762.66 TAKING THAT IDIOM OF AS IT WERE THE DARKNESS OF THE BODY TRANSFERRED
AntonyGormley_2012G@762.66:781.21 TO ARCHITECTURE CAN YOU USE ARCHITECTURAL SPACE NOT FOR LIVING BUT AS A METAPHOR AND USE ITS SYSTOLIC DIASTOLIC SMALLER AND LARGER SPACES TO PROVIDE A KIND OF FIRSTHAND SOMATIC NARRATIVE
AntonyGormley_2012G@781.21:787.02 FOR A JOURNEY THROUGH SPACE LIGHT AND DARKNESS
AntonyGormley_2012G@787.02:801.97 THIS IS A WORK OF SOME PROPORTION AND SOME WEIGHT THAT MAKES THE BODY INTO A CITY AN AGGREGATION OF CELLS THAT ARE ALL INTERCONNECTED AND THAT ALLOW
AntonyGormley_2012G@802.04:807.23 CERTAIN VISUAL ACCESS AT CERTAIN PLACES
AntonyGormley_2012G@807.23:818.54 THE LAST WORK THAT I JUST WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU IS BLIND LIGHT WHICH IS PERHAPS
AntonyGormley_2012G@846.1:853.15 YOU DISAPPEAR BOTH TO YOURSELVES AND TO OTHERS
AntonyGormley_2012G@853.15:860.39 IF YOU HOLD YOUR HAND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU YOU CAN 'T SEE IT IF YOU LOOK DOWN YOU CAN 'T SEE YOUR FEET
AntonyGormley_2012G@879.51:886.95 BUT THIS IS A SPACE THAT IS ACTUALLY FILLED WITH PEOPLE DISEMBODIED
AntonyGormley_2012G@886.95:899.12 VOICES AND OUT OF THAT AMBIENT ENVIRONMENT WHEN PEOPLE COME CLOSE TO YOUR OWN BODY ZONE VERY CLOSE THEY APPEAR TO YOU AS REPRESENTATIONS
AntonyGormley_2012G@899.12:909.65 WHEN THEY APPEAR CLOSE TO THE EDGE THEY ARE REPRESENTATIONS REPRESENTATIONS IN WHICH THE VIEWERS HAVE BECOME
AntonyGormley_2012G@924.25:927.96 AS JOHN CAGE SAID
AntonyGormley_2012G@927.96:945.29 WE ARE NOT MOVING TOWARDS SOME KIND OF GOAL WE ARE AT THE GOAL AND IT IS CHANGING WITH US IF ART HAS ANY PURPOSE IT IS TO OPEN OUR EYES TO THAT FACT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
