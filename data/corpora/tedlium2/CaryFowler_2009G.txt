CaryFowler_2009G I'VE BEEN FASCINATED WITH CROP DIVERSITY FOR ABOUT THIRTY FIVE YEARS FROM NOW EVER SINCE I STUMBLED ACROSS A FAIRLY OBSCURE ACADEMIC ARTICLE BY A GUY NAMED JACK HARLAN
CaryFowler_2009G AND HE DESCRIBED THE DIVERSITY WITHIN CROPS ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF WHEAT AND RICE AND SUCH AS A GENETIC RESOURCE
CaryFowler_2009G AND HE SAID THIS GENETIC RESOURCE AND I'LL NEVER FORGET THE WORDS STANDS BETWEEN US AND CATASTROPHIC STARVATION ON A SCALE WE CANNOT IMAGINE
CaryFowler_2009G I FIGURED HE WAS REALLY ON TO SOMETHING OR HE WAS ONE OF THESE ACADEMIC NUTCASES SO I LOOKED A LITTLE FURTHER AND WHAT I FIGURED OUT WAS THAT HE WASN'T A NUTCASE HE WAS THE MOST RESPECTED SCIENTIST IN THE FIELD
CaryFowler_2009G WHAT HE UNDERSTOOD WAS THAT BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY CROP DIVERSITY IS THE BIOLOGICAL FOUNDATION OF AGRICULTURE
CaryFowler_2009G IT'S THE RAW MATERIAL THE STUFF OF EVOLUTION IN OUR AGRICULTURAL CROPS NOT A TRIVIAL MATTER
CaryFowler_2009G AND HE ALSO UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT FOUNDATION WAS CRUMBLING LITERALLY CRUMBLING THAT INDEED A MASS EXTINCTION WAS UNDERWAY
CaryFowler_2009G IN OUR FIELDS IN OUR AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM AND THAT THIS MASS EXTINCTION WAS TAKING PLACE WITH VERY FEW PEOPLE NOTICING AND EVEN FEWER CARING
CaryFowler_2009G NOW I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU DON'T STOP TO THINK ABOUT DIVERSITY IN AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS AND LET 'S FACE IT THAT'S LOGICAL YOU DON'T SEE IT IN THE NEWSPAPER EVERY DAY AND WHEN YOU GO INTO THE SUPERMARKET YOU CERTAINLY DON'T SEE A LOT OF CHOICES THERE
CaryFowler_2009G YOU SEE APPLES THAT ARE RED YELLOW AND GREEN AND THAT'S ABOUT IT SO LET ME SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF ONE FORM OF DIVERSITY HERE 'S SOME BEANS AND
CaryFowler_2009G ARE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF BEANS ON THIS PICTURE NOW
CaryFowler_2009G IMAGINE EACH ONE OF THESE VARIETIES AS BEING DISTINCT FROM ANOTHER ABOUT THE SAME WAY AS A POODLE AS A GREAT DANE IF I WANTED TO SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF ALL THE DOG BREEDS IN THE WORLD
CaryFowler_2009G AND I PUT THIRTY OR FORTY OF THEM ON A SLIDE IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT TEN SLIDES BECAUSE THERE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED BREEDS OF DOGS IN THE WORLD
CaryFowler_2009G BUT THERE ARE THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY THOUSAND DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF BEANS SO IF I WERE TO GOING TO SHOW YOU ALL THE BEANS IN THE WORLD
CaryFowler_2009G AND I HAD A SLIDE LIKE THIS AND I SWITCHED IT EVERY SECOND IT WOULD TAKE UP MY ENTIRE TED TALK AND I WOULDN'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING
CaryFowler_2009G BUT THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT THIS DIVERSITY AND THE TRAGIC THING IS THAT THIS DIVERSITY IS BEING LOST WE HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF WHEAT
CaryFowler_2009G AND WE HAVE ABOUT TWO TO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF RICE BUT IT'S BEING LOST AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THAT
CaryFowler_2009G IT'S A BIT OF A PERSONAL EXAMPLE IN FACT IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE THE BEST
CaryFowler_2009G FARMERS AND GARDENERS WERE GROWING SEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NAMED VARIETIES OF APPLES IMAGINE THAT SEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED APPLES WITH NAMES TODAY SIX THOUSAND
CaryFowler_2009G EIGHT HUNDRED OF THOSE ARE EXTINCT NO LONGER TO BE SEEN AGAIN
CaryFowler_2009G AND AT THE END OF THE SPEECH I WOULD ASK HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE FOUND A NAME AND I NEVER HAD FEWER THAN TWO THIRDS OF AN AUDIENCE HOLD UP THEIR HAND AND I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT
CaryFowler_2009G THESE APPLES COME FROM YOUR ANCESTORS AND YOUR ANCESTORS GAVE THEM THE GREATEST HONOR THEY COULD GIVE THEM THEY GAVE THEM THEIR NAME
CaryFowler_2009G THE BAD NEWS IS THEY'RE EXTINCT THE GOOD NEWS IS A THIRD OF YOU DIDN'T HOLD UP YOUR HAND YOUR APPLE 'S STILL OUT THERE FIND IT MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T JOIN THE LIST
CaryFowler_2009G SO I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THE PIECE OF THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE FOWLER APPLE IS STILL OUT THERE
CaryFowler_2009G THE FOWLER APPLE IS DESCRIBED IN HERE I HOPE THIS DOESN'T SURPRISE YOU AS A BEAUTIFUL
CaryFowler_2009G I DON'T KNOW IF WE NAMED THE APPLE OF OR THE APPLE NAMED US
CaryFowler_2009G TO BE HONEST THE DESCRIPTION GOES ON AND IT SAYS THAT IT DOESN 'T RANK HIGH IN QUALITY HOWEVER AND THEN HE HAS TO GO EVEN FURTHER IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN BY AN OLD SCHOOL TEACHER OF
CaryFowler_2009G AS GROWN IN NEW YORK THE FRUIT USUALLY FAILS TO DEVELOP PROPERLY IN SIZE AND QUALITY AND IS ON THE WHOLE
CaryFowler_2009G AND I GUESS THERE'S A LESSON TO BE LEARNED HERE AND THE LESSON IS SO WHY SAVE IT I GET THIS QUESTION ALL THE TIME WHY DON'T WE JUST SAVE THE BEST ONE
CaryFowler_2009G AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION ONE THING IS THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A BEST ONE TODAY 'S BEST VARIETY IS TOMORROW 'S LUNCH FOR INSECTS OR PESTS OR DISEASE
CaryFowler_2009G THE OTHER THING IS THAT MAYBE THAT FOWLER APPLE OR MAYBE A VARIETY OF WHEAT THAT'S NOT ECONOMICAL RIGHT NOW
CaryFowler_2009G HAS DISEASE OR PEST RESISTANCE OR SOME QUALITY THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE THAT THE OTHERS DON 'T SO IT'S NOT NECESSARY
CaryFowler_2009G WHY AS A RAW MATERIAL AS A TRAIT WE CAN USE IN THE FUTURE THINK OF DIVERSITY AS
CaryFowler_2009G OPTIONS AND OPTIONS OF COURSE ARE EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED AN ERA OF CLIMATE CHANGE
CaryFowler_2009G AND UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON TO ASK THE QUESTION WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO AGRICULTURE IN AN ERA OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHAT KIND OF TRAITS AND CHARACTERISTICS DO WE NEED IN OUR AGRICULTURAL CROPS TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT TO THIS
CaryFowler_2009G IN SHORT THE ANSWER IS THAT IN THE FUTURE IN MANY COUNTRIES THE COLDEST GROWING SEASONS ARE GOING TO BE HOTTER
CaryFowler_2009G THAN ANYTHING THOSE CROPS HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST THE COLDEST GROWING SEASONS OF THE FUTURE HOTTER THAN THE HOTTEST OF THE PAST
CaryFowler_2009G AGRICULTURE ADAPTED TO THAT I DON'T KNOW CAN FISH PLAY THE PIANO IF AGRICULTURE HASN'T EXPERIENCED THAT HOW COULD IT BE ADAPTED
CaryFowler_2009G NOW THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF POOR AND HUNGRY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND THE PLACE WHERE CLIMATE CHANGE IRONICALLY IS GOING TO BE THE WORST IS IN SOUTH ASIA AND SUB SAHARA AFRICA SO I'VE PICKED TWO EXAMPLES HERE AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU
CaryFowler_2009G IN THE HISTOGRAM BEFORE YOU NOW THE BLUE BARS REPRESENT THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF TEMPERATURES GOING BACK
CaryFowler_2009G FAR AS WE HAVE TEMPERATURE DATA AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE GROWING SEASON AND ANOTHER SOME ARE COLDER SOME ARE HOTTER AND IT'S A BELL SHAPED CURVE
CaryFowler_2009G THE TALLEST BAR IS THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE FOR THE MOST NUMBER OF GROWING SEASONS IN THE FUTURE LATER THIS CENTURY IT'S GOING
CaryFowler_2009G TOTALLY OUT OF BOUNDS THE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE CROPS IN THE FIELD IN INDIA HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS BEFORE
CaryFowler_2009G THIRTY IF THE MAIZE OR CORN VARIETIES WHICH IS THE DOMINANT CROP FIFTY PERCENT OF THE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA ARE STILL IN THE FIELD
CaryFowler_2009G THIRTY PERCENT DECREASE OF PRODUCTION IN THE CONTEXT OF INCREASING POPULATION THAT'S A FOOD CRISES IT'S GLOBAL IN NATURE WE WILL WATCH CHILDREN STARVE TO DEATH ON TV
CaryFowler_2009G NOW YOU MAY SAY THAT TWENTY YEARS IS A LONG WAY OFF IT'S TWO BREEDING CYCLES FOR MAIZE WE HAVE TWO ROLLS OF THE DICE TO GET THIS RIGHT WE HAVE TO GET CLIMATE READY CROPS IN THE FIELD AND WE HAVE TO DO THAT RATHER QUICKLY
CaryFowler_2009G NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE HAVE CONSERVED WE HAVE COLLECTED AND CONSERVED A GREAT DEAL OF BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AGRICULTURAL DIVERSITY MOSTLY IN THE FORM OF SEED
CaryFowler_2009G AND WE PUT IT IN SEED BANKS WHICH IS A FANCY WAY OF SAYING A FREEZER IF YOU WANT TO CONSERVE SEED FOR A LONG TERM AND YOU WANT TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO PLANT BREEDERS AND RESEARCHERS YOU DRY IT AND THEN YOU FREEZE
CaryFowler_2009G IN RWANDA IN THE SOLOMON ISLANDS AND THEN THERE ARE JUST DAILY DISASTERS THAT TAKE PLACE IN THESE BUILDINGS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AND MISMANAGEMENT AND EQUIPMENT FAILURES AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS AND EVERY TIME SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS
CaryFowler_2009G IT MEANS EXTINCTION WE LOSE DIVERSITY AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT LOSING DIVERSITY IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU LOSE YOUR CAR KEYS I'M TALKING ABOUT LOSING IT IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE LOST THE DINOSAURS
CaryFowler_2009G ACTUALLY LOSING IT NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN SO A NUMBER OF US GOT TOGETHER AND DECIDED THAT YOU KNOW ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AND WE NEED TO HAVE A FACILITY
CaryFowler_2009G THAT CAN REALLY OFFER PROTECTION FOR OUR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY
CaryFowler_2009G MAYBE NOT THE MOST CHARISMATIC DIVERSITY YOU DON'T LOOK IN THE EYES OF A CARROT SEED QUITE IN THE WAY YOU DO A PANDA BEAR BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT DIVERSITY
CaryFowler_2009G SO WE NEEDED A REALLY SAFE PLACE AND WE WENT QUITE
CaryFowler_2009G FAR NORTH TO FIND IT TO SVALBARD IN FACT THIS IS ABOVE MAINLAND NORWAY YOU CAN SEE GREENLAND THERE THAT'S AT SEVENTY EIGHT DEGREES NORTH IT'S AS FAR AS YOU CAN FLY ON A REGULARLY SCHEDULED AIRPLANE
CaryFowler_2009G IT'S A REMARKABLY BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE IT TO YOU IT'S OTHERWORLDLY BEAUTIFUL WE WORKED WITH THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT AND WITH
CaryFowler_2009G WHICH IS BUILT IN A MOUNTAIN IN SVALBARD THE IDEA OF SVALBARD WAS THAT IT'S COLD SO WE GET NATURAL FREEZING TEMPERATURES
CaryFowler_2009G IT'S REMOTE IT'S REMOTE AND ACCESSIBLE SO IT'S SAFE AND WE DON'T DEPEND ON MECHANICAL REFRIGERATION THIS IS MORE THAN JUST AN ARTIST 'S DREAM IT'S NOW A REALITY
CaryFowler_2009G AND THIS NEXT PICTURE SHOWS IT IN CONTEXT IN SVALBARD AND HERE 'S THE FRONT DOOR OF THIS FACILITY WHEN YOU OPEN UP THE FRONT DOOR
CaryFowler_2009G THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE IT'S A HOLE IN THE GROUND IT'S A TUNNEL AND YOU GO INTO THE TUNNEL CHISELED IN SOLID ROCK ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY METERS THERE ARE NOW A COUPLE OF SECURITY DOORS SO YOU WON 'T SEE IT QUITE LIKE THIS AGAIN
CaryFowler_2009G WHEN YOU GET TO THE BACK YOU GET INTO AN AREA THAT'S REALLY MY FAVORITE WHY IS THAT I THINK OF IT AS SORT OF A CATHEDRAL AND I KNOW THAT THIS TAGS ME AS A BIT OF A NERD BUT SOME
CaryFowler_2009G THE HAPPIEST DAYS OF MY LIFE HAVE BEEN SPENT
CaryFowler_2009G IF YOU WERE TO WALK INTO ONE OF THESE ROOMS YOU WOULD SEE THIS IT'S NOT VERY EXCITING BUT IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S THERE IT'S PRETTY EMOTIONAL
CaryFowler_2009G WE HAVE NOW ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SAMPLES OF UNIQUE CROP VARIETIES THERE'S SEVENTY THOUSAND SAMPLES OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF RICE
CaryFowler_2009G IN THIS FACILITY RIGHT NOW ABOUT A YEAR FROM NOW WE'LL HAVE OVER HALF A MILLION SAMPLES WE'RE GOING UP TO OVER A MILLION AND SOMEDAY WE'LL BASICALLY HAVE
CaryFowler_2009G SAMPLES ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SEEDS OF EVERY VARIETY OF AGRICULTURAL CROP THAT CAN BE STORED IN A FROZEN STATE IN THIS FACILITY
CaryFowler_2009G THIS IS A BACKUP SYSTEM FOR WORLD AGRICULTURE IT'S A BACKUP SYSTEM FOR ALL THE SEED BANKS STORAGE IS FREE IT OPERATES LIKE A SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX NORWAY OWNS THE MOUNTAIN AND THE FACILITY BUT THE
CaryFowler_2009G THIS PARTICULAR PICTURE THAT YOU SEE SHOWS THE NATIONAL COLLECTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF CANADA AND AN INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTION FROM SYRIA I THINK IT'S INTERESTING IN THAT
CaryFowler_2009G THIS FACILITY I THINK IS ALMOST THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF THESE DAYS WHERE COUNTRIES LITERALLY
CaryFowler_2009G EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEDS FROM EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S BOTH LONG TERM
CaryFowler_2009G THE WATER CRISIS AGRICULTURE TAKES SEVENTY PERCENT OF FRESH WATER SUPPLIES ON EARTH I CAN'T LOOK YOU IN THE EYES AND TELL YOU THAT THERE IS SUCH A SOLUTION FOR THOSE THINGS OR THE ENERGY CRISIS OR WORLD HUNGER
CaryFowler_2009G OR PEACE IN CONFLICT I CAN'T I LOOK YOU IN THE EYES AND TELL YOU THAT I HAVE A SIMPLE SOLUTION FOR THAT BUT I CAN LOOK YOU IN THE
CaryFowler_2009G AND TELL YOU THAT WE CAN'T SOLVE ANY OF THOSE PROBLEMS IF WE DON'T HAVE CROP DIVERSITY BECAUSE I CHALLENGE YOU TO THINK OF
CaryFowler_2009G AN EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IF WE DON'T HAVE CROP DIVERSITY
CaryFowler_2009G BECAUSE QUITE LITERALLY IF AGRICULTURE DOESN'T ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE NEITHER WILL WE
CaryFowler_2009G AND IF CROPS DON'T ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE NEITHER WILL AGRICULTURE NEITHER WILL WE SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING PRETTY AND NICE TO DO THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THIS DIVERSITY EXIST JUST
CaryFowler_2009G FOR THE EXISTENCE VALUE OF IT IT IS I AGREE A NICE THING TO DO BUT IT'S A NECESSARY THING TO DO SO IN A VERY REALLY SENSE
CaryFowler_2009G I BELIEVE WE AS AN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD GET ORGANIZED TO COMPLETE THE TASK THE SVALBARD GLOBAL SEED VAULT
CaryFowler_2009G IS A WONDERFUL GIFT THAT NORWAY AND OTHERS HAVE GIVEN US BUT IT'S NOT THE COMPLETE ANSWER WE NEED TO COLLECT THE REMAINING DIVERSITY THAT'S OUT THERE
CaryFowler_2009G WE NEED TO PUT IT INTO GOOD SEED BANKS THAT CAN OFFER THOSE SEEDS TO RESEARCHERS IN THE FUTURE WE NEED TO CATALOG IT IT'S A LIBRARY OF LIFE BUT RIGHT NOW I WOULD SAY WE DON'T HAVE A CARD CATALOG FOR IT
CaryFowler_2009G AND WE NEED TO SUPPORT IT FINANCIALLY MY BIG IDEA WOULD BE THAT WHILE WE THINK OF IT AS COMMONPLACE TO ENDOW
CaryFowler_2009G AN ART MUSEUM OR ENDOW A CHAIR AT A UNIVERSITY WE REALLY OUGHT TO BE THINKING ABOUT ENDOWING WHEAT
CaryFowler_2009G THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN AN ENDOWMENT WOULD TAKE CARE OF PRESERVING ALL THE DIVERSITY IN WHEAT FOREVER SO WE NEED TO BE THINKING A LITTLE BIT IN THOSE TERMS AND MY FINAL THOUGHT IS THAT
CaryFowler_2009G WE OF COURSE BY CONSERVING WHEAT RICE POTATOES AND THE OTHER CROPS WE MAY QUITE SIMPLY END UP SAVING OURSELVES THANK YOU
