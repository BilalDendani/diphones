NancyLublin_2012U THAT YOU SEE HOPEFULLY NOT YOUR KIDS SENDING TO SOMEBODY ELSE OR TRYING TO TRANSLATE THE ABBREVIATIONS LOL LMAO HMU I CAN HELP YOU WITH THOSE LATER
NancyLublin_2012U BUT THE PARENTS IN THE ROOM KNOW THAT TEXTING IS ACTUALLY THE BEST WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR KIDS IT MIGHT BE THE ONLY WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR KIDS
NancyLublin_2012U FOR MINORITY AND URBAN YOUTH I KNOW THIS BECAUSE AT DOSOMETHING ORG WHICH IS THE LARGEST ORGANIZATION FOR TEENAGERS AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN AMERICA ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO WE PIVOTED AND STARTED FOCUSING ON TEXT MESSAGING WE 'RE NOW TEXTING OUT TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND KIDS A WEEK
