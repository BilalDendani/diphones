PatrickChappatte_2010G THIS WAS SO SICKENING PEOPLE DIED BECAUSE OF CARTOONS
PatrickChappatte_2010G AND THEN OF COURSE THEY WERE USED BY EXTREMISTS AND POLITICIANS ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY WANTED TO STIR UP CONTROVERSY YOU KNOW THE STORY
PatrickChappatte_2010G WE KNOW THAT CARTOONS CAN BE USED AS WEAPONS
PatrickChappatte_2010G AND HERE WE ARE NOW
PatrickChappatte_2010G IN THE UNITED NATIONS HALF OF THE WORLD IS PUSHING TO PENALIZE THE OFFENSE TO RELIGION THEY CALL IT THE DEFAMATION OF RELIGION WHILE THE OTHER HALF OF THE WORLD IS FIGHTING BACK IN DEFENSE OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH
PatrickChappatte_2010G THE CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS IS HERE AND CARTOONS ARE
PatrickChappatte_2010G THIS GOT ME THINKING
PatrickChappatte_2010G NOW TALK OF A DIVIDED PLACE THE COUNTRY WAS CUT IN TWO YOU HAD A REBELLION IN THE NORTH THE GOVERNMENT IN THE SOUTH THE CAPITAL ABIDJAN AND IN THE MIDDLE THE FRENCH
PatrickChappatte_2010G THIS LOOKS LIKE A GIANT HAMBURGER YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
PatrickChappatte_2010G IN THE
PatrickChappatte_2010G I WAS THERE TO REPORT ON THAT STORY
PatrickChappatte_2010G IN CARTOONS I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS IT'S MY SIDE JOB IF YOU WANT SO YOU SEE THE STYLE IS DIFFERENT THIS IS MORE SERIOUS THAN MAYBE
PatrickChappatte_2010G I WENT TO PLACES LIKE GAZA DURING THE WAR IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE SO THIS IS REALLY JOURNALISM IN CARTOONS YOU'LL HEAR MORE AND MORE ABOUT IT THIS IS THE FUTURE OF JOURNALISM I THINK
PatrickChappatte_2010G AND OF COURSE I WENT TO SEE THE REBELS IN THE NORTH THOSE WERE POOR GUYS FIGHTING FOR THEIR RIGHTS THERE WAS AN
PatrickChappatte_2010G I WENT TO SEE THE DOZO THE DOZO THEY ARE THE TRADITIONAL HUNTERS OF WEST AFRICA PEOPLE FEAR THEM THEY HELP THE REBELLION
PatrickChappatte_2010G THEY ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE MAGICAL POWERS THEY CAN DISAPPEAR
PatrickChappatte_2010G I WENT TO SEE A DOZO CHIEF
PatrickChappatte_2010G HE TOLD ME ABOUT HIS MAGICAL POWERS HE SAID I CAN CHOP YOUR HEAD OFF RIGHT AWAY AND BRING YOU BACK TO LIFE I SAID WELL MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS
PatrickChappatte_2010G RIGHT NOW
PatrickChappatte_2010G ANOTHER TIME
PatrickChappatte_2010G BACK IN ABIDJAN I WAS GIVEN A CHANCE
PatrickChappatte_2010G TO LEAD A WORKSHOP WITH LOCAL CARTOONISTS THERE
PatrickChappatte_2010G AND I THOUGHT YES IN A CONTEXT LIKE THIS CARTOONS CAN REALLY BE USED AS WEAPONS AGAINST THE OTHER SIDE
PatrickChappatte_2010G THE PRESS IN IVORY COAST WAS BITTERLY DIVIDED IT WAS COMPARED TO THE MEDIA IN RWANDA BEFORE THE GENOCIDE
PatrickChappatte_2010G SO IMAGINE AND WHAT CAN A CARTOONIST DO SOMETIMES EDITORS WOULD TELL THEIR CARTOONISTS TO DRAW WHAT THEY WANTED TO SEE AND THE GUY HAS TO FEED HIS FAMILY RIGHT
PatrickChappatte_2010G PRETTY SIMPLE WE BROUGHT TOGETHER CARTOONISTS FROM ALL SIDES
PatrickChappatte_2010G IN IVORY COAST WE TOOK THEM AWAY FROM THEIR NEWSPAPER FOR THREE DAYS AND I ASKED THEM TO DO A PROJECT TOGETHER TACKLING THE ISSUES
PatrickChappatte_2010G IN CARTOONS YES IN CARTOONS SHOW THE POSITIVE POWER OF CARTOONS IT'S A GREAT TOOL OF COMMUNICATION FOR BAD OR FOR GOOD
PatrickChappatte_2010G AND CARTOONS CAN CROSS BOUNDARIES AS YOU HAVE SEEN
PatrickChappatte_2010G IS A GOOD WAY I THINK TO ADDRESS SERIOUS ISSUES
PatrickChappatte_2010G I'M VERY PROUD OF WHAT THEY DID I MEAN THEY DIDN'T AGREE WITH EACH OTHER THAT WAS NOT THE POINT AND I DIDN'T ASK THEM TO DO NICE CARTOONS THE FIRST DAY THEY WERE EVEN SHOUTING AT EACH OTHER BUT THEY CAME UP WITH A BOOK LOOKING BACK
PatrickChappatte_2010G OF POLITICAL CRISIS IN IVORY COAST
PatrickChappatte_2010G SO THE IDEA WAS THERE AND I'VE BEEN DOING PROJECTS LIKE THIS IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE IN LEBANON
PatrickChappatte_2010G THIS YEAR IN KENYA BACK IN JANUARY IN LEBANON IT WAS NOT A BOOK THE IDEA WAS TO HAVE THE SAME PRINCIPAL A DIVIDED COUNTRY TAKE CARTOONISTS FROM ALL SIDES AND LET THEM DO SOMETHING TOGETHER
PatrickChappatte_2010G SO IN LEBANON WE ENROLLED THE NEWSPAPER EDITORS AND WE GOT THEM TO PUBLISH EIGHT CARTOONISTS FROM ALL SIDES ALL TOGETHER
PatrickChappatte_2010G ON THE SAME PAGE ADDRESSING THE ISSUE AFFECTING LEBANON LIKE RELIGION IN POLITICS AND EVERYDAY LIFE AND IT WORKED
PatrickChappatte_2010G FOR THREE DAYS ALMOST ALL THE NEWSPAPERS OF BEIRUT PUBLISHED ALL THOSE CARTOONISTS TOGETHER ANTI GOVERNMENT
PatrickChappatte_2010G PRO GOVERNMENT CHRISTIAN
PatrickChappatte_2010G MUSLIM OF COURSE ENGLISH SPEAKING
PatrickChappatte_2010G SO THIS WAS A GREAT PROJECT
PatrickChappatte_2010G IN KENYA WHAT WE DID
PatrickChappatte_2010G AS YOU HAVE SEEN IN CONTEXTS OF REPRESSION OR DIVISION AGAIN WHAT CAN A CARTOONIST DO
PatrickChappatte_2010G HE HAS TO KEEP HIS JOB
PatrickChappatte_2010G WELL I BELIEVE THAT IN ANY CONTEXT ANYWHERE
PatrickChappatte_2010G AT LEAST NOT TO DO A CARTOON THAT WILL FEED HATRED
PatrickChappatte_2010G AND THAT'S THE MESSAGE I TRY TO CONVEY TO THEM
PatrickChappatte_2010G ALL ALWAYS HAVE THE CHOICE IN THE END NOT TO DO THE
PatrickChappatte_2010G BUT WE NEED TO SUPPORT THESE CRITICAL
PatrickChappatte_2010G RESPONSIBLE VOICES IN AFRICA IN LEBANON
PatrickChappatte_2010G IN YOUR LOCAL NEWSPAPER
PatrickChappatte_2010G FOR DICTATORS ALL OVER THE WORLD
PatrickChappatte_2010G THE GOOD NEWS
PatrickChappatte_2010G AND ACTIVISTS SHUT UP
