KevinKelly_2005 I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I HAVEN'T QUITE FIGURED OUT EXACTLY WHAT TECHNOLOGY MEANS IN MY LIFE I'VE SPENT THE PAST YEAR THINKING ABOUT
KevinKelly_2005 WHAT IT REALLY SHOULD BE ABOUT SHOULD I BE PRO TECHNOLOGY SHOULD I EMBRACE IT FULL ARMS SHOULD I BE WARY LIKE YOU I'M VERY TEMPTED BY THE LATEST THING BUT AT THE OTHER HAND A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I GAVE UP
KevinKelly_2005 ALL OF MY POSSESSIONS SOLD ALL MY TECHNOLOGY EXCEPT FOR A BICYCLE AND RODE ACROSS THREE THOUSAND MILES ON THE U S BACK ROADS UNDER THE POWER OF MY ONE BODY
KevinKelly_2005 FUELLED MOSTLY BY TWINKIES AND JUNK FOOD AND I'VE SINCE THEN TRIED TO KEEP TECHNOLOGY AT ARM 'S LENGTH IN MANY WAYS SO IT DOESN'T MASTER MY LIFE
KevinKelly_2005 THE SAME TIME I RUN A WEBSITE ON COOL TOOLS WHERE I ISSUE A DAILY OBSESSION OF THE LATEST THINGS IN TECHNOLOGY SO I'M STILL PERPLEXED ABOUT WHAT THE TRUE MEANING OF TECHNOLOGY IS
KevinKelly_2005 AS IT RELATES TO HUMANITY AS IT RELATES TO NATURE AS IT RELATES TO THE SPIRITUAL AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE WE KNOW WHAT TECHNOLOGY IS AND
KevinKelly_2005 ONE DEFINITION OF TECHNOLOGY IS THAT WHICH IS FIRST RECORDED THIS IS THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF THE MODERN USE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT I CAN FIND
KevinKelly_2005 I LIKE ONE OF THE DEFINITIONS THAT ALAN KAY HAS FOR TECHNOLOGY HE SAYS TECHNOLOGY IS ANYTHING THAT WAS INVENTED AFTER YOU WERE BORN
KevinKelly_2005 SUMS UP A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DANNY HILLIS ACTUALLY HAS AN UPDATE ON THAT HE SAYS TECHNOLOGY IS ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T QUITE WORK YET WHICH ALSO
KevinKelly_2005 I THINK GETS INTO A LITTLE BIT OF OUR CURRENT IDEA BUT I WAS INTERESTED IN ANOTHER DEFINITION OF TECHNOLOGY SOMETHING AGAIN THAT WENT BACK TO SOMETHING MORE FUNDAMENTAL
KevinKelly_2005 SOMETHING THAT WAS DEEPER AND AS I STRUGGLED TO UNDERSTAND THAT I CAME UP WITH A WAY OF FRAMING THE QUESTION THAT SEEMED TO WORK FOR ME IN MY INVESTIGATIONS AND I'M
KevinKelly_2005 THIS MORNING GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME SO THIS IS A VERY ROUGH ATTEMPT TO THINK OUT LOUD THE QUESTION THAT I CAME UP WITH WAS
KevinKelly_2005 THIS QUESTION WHAT DOES TECHNOLOGY WANT AND BY THAT I DON'T MEAN DOES IT WANT CHOCOLATE OR VANILLA
KevinKelly_2005 BY WHAT IT WANTS I MEAN WHAT ARE ITS INHERENT TRENDS AND BIASES WHAT ARE ITS TENDENCIES OVER TIME ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS THINKING ABOUT BIOLOGICAL ORGANISMS WHICH WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT
KevinKelly_2005 AND THE TRICK THAT RICHARD DAWKINS DOES WHICH IS TO SAY TO LOOK AT THEM AS SIMPLY AS GENES AS VEHICLES FOR GENES SO HE 'S SAYING WHAT DO GENES WANT THE SELFISH GENE
KevinKelly_2005 AND I'M APPLYING A SIMILAR TRICK TO SAY WHAT IF WE LOOKED AT THE UNIVERSE IN OUR CULTURE THROUGH THE EYES OF TECHNOLOGY WHAT DOES TECHNOLOGY WANT
KevinKelly_2005 WHAT DOES IT WANT AND I THINK ONCE WE ASK THAT QUESTION WE HAVE TO GO BACK ACTUALLY TO LIFE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY
KevinKelly_2005 IF WE KEEP EXTENDING THE ORIGINS OF TECHNOLOGY FAR BACK I THINK WE COME BACK TO LIFE AT SOME POINT SO THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO BEGIN MY LITTLE EXPLORATION IS IN LIFE AND LIKE YOU HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS WE DON'T REALLY KNOW
KevinKelly_2005 WHAT LIFE THERE IS ON EARTH RIGHT NOW WE HAVE REALLY NO IDEA
KevinKelly_2005 CRAIG VENTER 'S TREMENDOUS AND BRILLIANT ATTEMPT TO DNA SEQUENCE THINGS IN THE OCEAN IS GREAT BRIAN FARRELL 'S WORK
KevinKelly_2005 ALL PART OF THIS AGENDA TO TRY AND ACTUALLY DISCOVER ALL THE SPECIES ON EARTH AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD DO IS JUST MAKE A GRID OF THE GLOBE AND RANDOMLY
KevinKelly_2005 WE WOULD BEGIN TO SEE SOME INCREDIBLE SPECIES THIS IS NOT ON ANOTHER PLANET THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE HIDDEN AWAY ON OUR PLANET THIS IS AN ANT THAT STORES
KevinKelly_2005 EACH ONE OF THEM IS THEY'RE HACKING THE RULES OF LIFE I CAN'T THINK OF A SINGLE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF BIOLOGY THAT DOES NOT
KevinKelly_2005 HAVE AN EXCEPTION SOMEWHERE BY SOME ORGANISM EVERY SINGLE THING THAT WE CAN THINK OF AND IF YOU HEARD OLIVIA 'S TALK ABOUT THE SEXUAL HABITS YOU'LL REALIZE THAT THERE ISN'T ANYTHING WE CAN SAY THAT'S TRUE FOR ALL LIFE BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS HACKING
KevinKelly_2005 SOMETHING ABOUT IT THIS IS A SOLAR POWERED SEA SLUG IT'S A NUDIBRANCH THAT HAS INCORPORATED CHLOROPLAST INSIDE IT TO DRIVE ITS ENERGY
KevinKelly_2005 THIS IS ANOTHER VERSION OF THAT THIS IS A SEA DRAGON AND THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM THE BLUE ONE IS A JUVENILE THAT HAS NOT YET SWALLOWED THE ACID HAS NOT YET TAKEN
KevinKelly_2005 THE BROWN GREEN ALGAE POND SCUM INTO ITS BODY TO GIVE IT ENERGY THESE ARE HACKS AND
KevinKelly_2005 IF WE LOOKED AT THE GENERAL SHAPE OF THE APPROACHES TO HACKING LIFE THERE ARE CURRENT CONSENSUS SIX KINGDOMS
KevinKelly_2005 SIX DIFFERENT BROAD APPROACHES THE PLANTS THE ANIMALS THE FUNGI THE PROTISTS THE LITTLE THINGS THE BACTERIA AND THE
KevinKelly_2005 THOSE ARE THE GENERAL APPROACHES TO LIFE THAT'S ONE WAY TO LOOK AT LIFE ON EARTH TODAY BUT A MORE INTERESTING WAY THE CURRENT WAY TO TAKE THE LONG VIEW IS TO LOOK AT IT IN AN EVOLUTIONARY
KevinKelly_2005 PERSPECTIVE AND HERE WE HAVE A VIEW OF EVOLUTION WHERE RATHER THAN HAVING EVOLUTION GO OVER THE LINEAR TIME WE HAVE IT COMING OUT FROM THE CENTER
KevinKelly_2005 SO IN THE CENTER IS THE MOST PRIMITIVE AND THIS IS A GENEALOGICAL CHART OF ALL LIFE ON EARTH THIS IS ALL THE SAME SIX KINGDOMS YOU SEE FOUR THOUSAND REPRESENTATIVE
KevinKelly_2005 SPECIES AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE WE ARE BUT WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS IS IT SHOWS THAT EVERY LIVING ORGANISM ON EARTH TODAY IS EQUALLY EVOLVED
KevinKelly_2005 THOSE FUNGI AND BACTERIA ARE AS HIGHLY EVOLVED AS HUMANS THEY'VE BEEN AROUND JUST AS LONG AND GONE THROUGH JUST THE SAME KIND OF TRIAL AND ERROR TO GET HERE
KevinKelly_2005 BUT WE SEE THAT EACH ONE OF THESE IS ACTUALLY HACKING AND HAS A DIFFERENT WAY OF FINDING OUT HOW TO DO LIFE
KevinKelly_2005 AND IF WE TAKE THE LONG TERM TRENDS OF LIFE IF WE BEGIN TO SAY WHAT DOES EVOLUTION WANT THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS THAT WE SEE ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT EVOLUTION IS THAT
KevinKelly_2005 NOWHERE ON EARTH HAVE WE EVER BEEN
KevinKelly_2005 AND WHEREVER LIFE IS IT NEVER RETREATS IT'S UBIQUITOUS AND IT WANTS TO BE MORE MORE AND MORE OF THE INERT MATTER OF THE GLOBE IS BEING TOUCHED AND ANIMATED BY LIFE THE SECOND THING IS IS WE SEE
KevinKelly_2005 THAT'S VERY INTUITIVE AND ACTUALLY WE HAVE CURRENT DATA THAT DOES SHOW THAT THERE IS AN ACTUAL DRIFT TOWARDS COMPLEXITY OVER TIME AND THE LAST THING I BRING BACK THIS
KevinKelly_2005 ONE OF THE THINGS WE SEE ABOUT LIFE IS THAT IT MOVES FROM THE INNER TO INCREASING SOCIABILITY AND BY THAT IT MEANS THAT THERE IS MORE AND MORE OF LIFE
KevinKelly_2005 WHOSE ENTIRE ENVIRONMENT IS OTHER LIFE LIKE THOSE CHLOROPLAST CELLS THEY'RE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY OTHER LIFE THEY NEVER TOUCH THE INNER MATTER
KevinKelly_2005 THERE IS MORE AND MORE CO EVOLUTION AND SO THE GENERAL LONG TERM TRENDS OF EVOLUTION ARE ROUGHLY THESE FIVE UBIQUITY DIVERSITY SPECIALIZATION COMPLEXITY AND SOCIALIZATION
KevinKelly_2005 NOW I TOOK THAT AND SAID OK WHAT ARE THE LONG TERM TRENDS IN TECHNOLOGY AND AGAIN MY QUESTION IS WHAT DOES TECHNOLOGY WANT AND SO
KevinKelly_2005 THIS IS A SCENE FROM STAR WARS WHERE THE THREE PO COMES OUT AND HE SEES MACHINES MAKING MACHINES HOW DEPRAVED WELL THIS IS ACTUALLY
KevinKelly_2005 WHAT WE'RE HEADED TOWARDS WORLD MACHINES AND THE TECHNOLOGY IS ONLY BEING THROWN OUT BY OTHER TECHNOLOGIES MOST MACHINES WILL ONLY EVER BE IN CONTACT WITH OTHER TECHNOLOGY AND NOT NON TECHNOLOGY OR EVEN LIFE
KevinKelly_2005 AND THIRDLY THE IDEA THAT MACHINES ARE BECOMING BIOLOGICAL AND COMPLEX IS AT THIS POINT A CLICHE
KevinKelly_2005 THAT IS MAYBE NOT A BIG SURPRISE BECAUSE IF WE MAP OUT SAY THE EVOLUTION OF ARMOR YOU CAN ACTUALLY FOLLOW A SORT OF AN EVOLUTIONARY TYPE CLADISTIC TREE
KevinKelly_2005 I SUGGEST IN FACT TECHNOLOGY IS THE SEVENTH KINGDOM OF LIFE THAT ITS OPERATIONS AND HOW IT WORKS IS SO SIMILAR THAT WE CAN THINK OF IT AS THE SEVENTH KINGDOM
KevinKelly_2005 ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED OF THEM AND HE HAS DECIDED TO TREAT THEM AS IF THEY WERE TRIBOLITES OR SNAILS AND TO DO A MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS AND TRY TO
KevinKelly_2005 THEIR GENEALOGICAL HISTORY OVER TIME THIS IS HIS CHART WHICH IS NOT QUITE PUBLISHED YET BUT THE MOST INTERESTING ASPECT ABOUT THIS
KevinKelly_2005 IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE RED LINES AT THE BOTTOM THOSE INDICATE BASICALLY A PARENTAGE OF A TYPE OF CORNET THAT WAS NO LONGER MADE
KevinKelly_2005 THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN IN BIOLOGY WHEN SOMETHING IS EXTINCT YOU CAN'T HAVE IT AS YOUR PARENT BUT THAT DOES HAPPEN IN TECHNOLOGY AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT'S SO DISTINCTIVE
KevinKelly_2005 THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT THIS TREE AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE IT TO DETERMINE THAT THIS IS A TECHNOLOGICAL SYSTEM VERSUS
KevinKelly_2005 A BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM IN FACT THIS IDEA OF RESURRECTING THE WHOLE IDEA IS SO IMPORTANT THAT I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT
KevinKelly_2005 WHAT HAPPENS WITH OLD TECHNOLOGY AND IT TURNS OUT THAT IN FACT TECHNOLOGIES DON'T DIE SO I SUGGESTED THIS TO AN HISTORIAN OF SCIENCE AND HE SAID WELL WHAT ABOUT YOU KNOW
KevinKelly_2005 COME ON WHAT ABOUT STEAM CARS THEY'RE NOT AROUND ANYMORE WELL
KevinKelly_2005 BUYING STEAM VALVES I MEAN IT WAS JUST IT WAS REALLY THERE AND SO I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT WELL MAYBE THAT'S JUST A RANDOM SAMPLE MAYBE I SHOULD DO THIS SORT OF IN A MORE
KevinKelly_2005 ALL OF THEM ARE STILL BEING PRODUCED SO YOU'VE GOT CORN SHELLERS I DON'T KNOW WHO NEEDS A CORN SHELLER BE IT CORN SHELLERS YOU 'VE GOT
KevinKelly_2005 YOU CAN BUY FOR FIFTY BUCKS A STONE AGE KNIFE MADE EXACTLY THE SAME WAY
KevinKelly_2005 TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO IT'S SHORT BONE HANDLE FIFTY BUCKS AND IN FACT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THIS INFORMATION ACTUALLY NEVER DIED OUT
KevinKelly_2005 IT WAS RESURRECTED IT'S CONTINUED ALL ALONG AND IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA THEY WERE MAKING STONE AXES UNTIL TWO DECADES AGO JUST AS A COURSE OF PRACTICAL MATTERS
KevinKelly_2005 EVEN WHEN WE TRY TO GET RID OF A TECHNOLOGY IT'S ACTUALLY VERY HARD SO WE'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT THE AMISH GIVING UP CARS WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE
KevinKelly_2005 AND THEN I TRIED TO FIND OUT WHEN THEY WERE WHEN THEY CAME BACK IN BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS CAME BACK IN AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE TIME THE DURATION OF WHEN THEY WERE OUTLAWED AND PROHIBITED IS DECREASING
KevinKelly_2005 OVER TIME AND THAT BASICALLY YOU CAN DELAY TECHNOLOGY BUT YOU CAN'T KILL IT SO THIS MAKES SENSE BECAUSE IN A CERTAIN SENSE WHAT CULTURE IS
KevinKelly_2005 IS THE ACCUMULATION OF IDEAS THAT'S WHAT IT'S FOR IT'S SO THAT IDEAS DON'T DIE OUT AND WHEN WE TAKE THAT
KevinKelly_2005 WE TAKE THIS IDEA OF WHAT CULTURE IS DOING AND ADD IT TO WHAT THE LONG TERM TRAJECTORY AGAIN IN LIFE 'S EVOLUTION
KevinKelly_2005 WE FIND THAT EACH CASE EACH OF THE MAJOR TRANSITIONS IN LIFE WHAT THEY'RE REALLY ABOUT IS ACCELERATING AND CHANGING THE WAY IN WHICH EVOLUTION HAPPENS
KevinKelly_2005 THEY'RE ACTUALLY CHANGING THE WAY IN WHICH IDEAS ARE GENERATED SO ALL THESE STEPS IN EVOLUTION ARE INCREASING BASICALLY THE EVOLUTION OF EVOLVABILITY SO WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER TIME IN LIFE
KevinKelly_2005 IS THAT THE WAYS IN WHICH YOU GENERATE THESE NEW IDEAS THESE NEW HACKS ARE INCREASING AND THE REAL TRICKS ARE WAYS IN WHICH YOU KIND OF EXPLORE THE WAY OF EXPLORING
KevinKelly_2005 AND THEN WHAT WE SEE IN THE SINGULARITY THAT PROPHESIZED BY KURZWEIL AND OTHERS HIS IDEA THAT TECHNOLOGY IS ACCELERATING EVOLUTION IT'S ACCELERATING THE WAY IN WHICH WE SEARCH FOR IDEAS
KevinKelly_2005 SO IF YOU HAVE LIFE HACKING LIFE MEANS HACKING THE GAME OF SURVIVAL THEN EVOLUTION IS A WAY TO EXTEND THE GAME BY CHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME
KevinKelly_2005 WHAT TECHNOLOGY IS REALLY ABOUT IS BETTER WAYS TO EVOLVE THAT IS WHAT WE CALL AN INFINITE GAME
KevinKelly_2005 THAT'S THE DEFINITION OF INFINITE GAME A FINITE GAME IS PLAY TO WIN AND AN INFINITE GAME IS PLAYED TO KEEP PLAYING AND I BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGY IS ACTUALLY
KevinKelly_2005 THE ENTIRE HUGE BILLIONS OF STARS IN THE UNIVERSE WERE COMPRESSED THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE WAS COMPRESSED INTO A LITTLE QUANTUM DOT
KevinKelly_2005 AND IT WAS SO TIGHT IN THERE THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL THAT'S THE DEFINITION THERE WAS NO TEMPERATURE THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER AND AT THE BIG BANG WHAT IT EXPANDED WAS THE POTENTIAL FOR DIFFERENCE
KevinKelly_2005 SO AS IT EXPANDS AND AS THINGS EXPAND WHAT WE HAVE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR DIFFERENCES DIVERSITY
KevinKelly_2005 OPTIONS CHOICES OPPORTUNITIES POSSIBILITIES AND FREEDOMS THOSE ARE ALL BASICALLY THE SAME THING AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT TECHNOLOGY BRING US
KevinKelly_2005 THAT'S WHAT TECHNOLOGY IS BRINGING US CHOICES POSSIBILITIES FREEDOMS THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT IT'S THIS EXPANSION OF ROOM TO MAKE DIFFERENCES
KevinKelly_2005 AND SO A HAMMER WHEN WE GRAB A HAMMER THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GRABBING AND THAT'S WHY WE CONTINUE TO GRAB TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE WE WANT THOSE THINGS THOSE THINGS ARE GOOD DIFFERENCES FREEDOM CHOICES POSSIBILITIES
KevinKelly_2005 AND EACH TIME WE MAKE A NEW OPPORTUNITY PLACE WE'RE ALLOWING A PLATFORM TO MAKE NEW ONES AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU CAN IMAGINE MOZART BEFORE THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE PIANO WAS INVENTED
KevinKelly_2005 WHAT A LOSS TO SOCIETY THERE WOULD BE IMAGINE VAN GOGH BEING BORN BEFORE THE TECHNOLOGIES OF CHEAP OIL PAINTS IMAGINE
KevinKelly_2005 WHOSE TECHNOLOGY OF SELF EXPRESSION HAS NOT YET BEEN INVENTED WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO INVENT TECHNOLOGY SO THAT EVERY PERSON ON THE GLOBE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REALIZE THEIR TRUE DIFFERENCE
KevinKelly_2005 WE WANT A TRILLION ZILLION SPECIES OF ONE INDIVIDUALS THAT'S WHAT TECHNOLOGY REALLY WANTS I'M GOING TO SKIP THROUGH SOME OF THE OBJECTIONS BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANSWERS TO WHY
KevinKelly_2005 THERE'S DEFORESTATION I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SEEM TO BE BAD TECHNOLOGIES I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO
KevinKelly_2005 HOW THIS IMPACTS ON OUR DIGNITY OTHER THAN TO SUGGEST THAT MAYBE THE SEVENTH KINGDOM BECAUSE IT'S SO CLOSE TO WHAT LIFE IS ABOUT
KevinKelly_2005 MAYBE WE CAN BRING IT BACK AND HAVE IT HELP US MONITOR LIFE MAYBE IN SOME WAYS THE FACT THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH TECHNOLOGY IS FIND A GOOD HOME FOR
KevinKelly_2005 IT'S A TERRIBLE THING TO SPRAY DDT ON COTTON FIELDS BUT IT'S A REALLY GOOD THING TO USE TO ELIMINATE MILLIONS OF CASES OF DEATH DUE TO MALARIA IN A SMALL VILLAGE
KevinKelly_2005 OUR HUMANITY IS ACTUALLY DEFINED BY TECHNOLOGY ALL THE THINGS THAT WE THINK THAT WE REALLY LIKE ABOUT HUMANITY IS BEING DRIVEN BY TECHNOLOGY THIS IS THE INFINITE GAME
KevinKelly_2005 THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU SEE TECHNOLOGY IS A WAY TO EVOLVE THE EVOLUTION IT'S A WAY TO EXPLORE
KevinKelly_2005 WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT TECHNOLOGY WANTS I THINK THAT IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT EVERY PERSON HERE AND I REALLY BELIEVE THIS EVERY PERSON HERE HAS AN ASSIGNMENT AND YOUR ASSIGNMENT IS
KevinKelly_2005 TO SPEND YOUR LIFE DISCOVERING WHAT YOUR ASSIGNMENT IS THAT RECURSIVE NATURE IS THE INFINITE GAME AND IF YOU PLAY THAT WELL
KevinKelly_2005 HAVE OTHER PEOPLE INVOLVED SO EVEN THAT GAME EXTENDS AND CONTINUES EVEN WHEN YOU'RE GONE THAT IS THE INFINITE GAME AND WHAT TECHNOLOGY IS IS THE MEDIUM IN WHICH
KevinKelly_2005 WE PLAY THAT INFINITE GAME AND SO I THINK THAT WE SHOULD EMBRACE TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE IT IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR JOURNEY IN FINDING OUT
KevinKelly_2005 WHO WE ARE THANK YOU
