CandyChang_2012G A LOT OF WAYS THE PEOPLE AROUND US CAN HELP IMPROVE OUR LIVES WE DON 'T BUMP INTO EVERY NEIGHBOR SO A LOT OF WISDOM NEVER GETS PASSED ON THOUGH WE DO SHARE THE SAME PUBLIC SPACES SO OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS I 'VE TRIED WAYS TO SHARE MORE WITH MY NEIGHBORS IN PUBLIC SPACE
CandyChang_2012G USING SIMPLE TOOLS LIKE STICKERS STENCILS AND CHALK AND THESE PROJECTS CAME FROM QUESTIONS I HAD LIKE
CandyChang_2012G HOW MUCH ARE MY NEIGHBORS PAYING FOR THEIR APARTMENTS LAUGHTER HOW CAN WE LEND AND BORROW MORE THINGS WITHOUT KNOCKING ON EACH OTHER 'S DOORS AT A BAD TIME
CandyChang_2012G HOW CAN WE SHARE MORE OF OUR MEMORIES OF OUR ABANDONED BUILDINGS AND GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF OUR LANDSCAPE
CandyChang_2012G AND HOW CAN WE SHARE MORE OF OUR HOPES FOR OUR VACANT STOREFRONTS SO OUR COMMUNITIES CAN REFLECT OUR NEEDS
CandyChang_2012G HER NAME WAS JOAN AND SHE WAS A MOTHER TO ME
CandyChang_2012G AND HER DEATH WAS SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED
CandyChang_2012G AND I THOUGHT ABOUT DEATH A LOT
CandyChang_2012G AND
CandyChang_2012G BUT I STRUGGLE
CandyChang_2012G TO MAINTAIN THIS PERSPECTIVE IN MY DAILY LIFE
CandyChang_2012G I FEEL LIKE IT 'S EASY TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THE DAY TO DAY AND FORGET WHAT REALLY MATTERS TO YOU
CandyChang_2012G SO WITH HELP FROM OLD AND NEW FRIENDS I TURNED THE SIDE OF THIS ABANDONED HOUSE INTO A GIANT CHALKBOARD AND STENCILED IT WITH A FILL IN THE BLANK SENTENCE
CandyChang_2012G BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO
CandyChang_2012G SO ANYONE WALKING BY CAN PICK UP A PIECE OF CHALK REFLECT ON THEIR LIVES AND SHARE THEIR PERSONAL ASPIRATIONS IN PUBLIC SPACE
CandyChang_2012G BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO BE TRIED FOR PIRACY
CandyChang_2012G BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO STRADDLE THE INTERNATIONAL DATE LINE
CandyChang_2012G BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO SING FOR MILLIONS
CandyChang_2012G BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO PLANT A TREE
CandyChang_2012G BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO LIVE OFF THE GRID
CandyChang_2012G BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO HOLD HER ONE MORE TIME
CandyChang_2012G BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO BE SOMEONE 'S CAVALRY
CandyChang_2012G BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO BE COMPLETELY MYSELF
CandyChang_2012G THINKING ABOUT DEATH CLARIFIES YOUR LIFE
