BenKatchor_2002@162.72:169.79 THE SOUND MADE FLICKING A WALL SWITCH OFF IS OF A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NATURE
BenKatchor_2002@170.07:179.54 IT HAS A DEEP MELANCHOLY RING CHILDREN DON'T LIKE IT IT'S WHY THEY LEAVE LIGHTS ON AROUND THE HOUSE
BenKatchor_2002@180.49:194.96 ADULTS FIND IT COMFORTING BUT WOULDN'T IT BE AN EASY MATTER TO WIRE A WALL SWITCH SO THAT IT TRIGGERS THE MUTED HORN OF A STEAM SHIP OR THE RECORDED CROWING OF A ROOSTER

BenKatchor_2002@267.48:275.01 ALTHOUGH THEY MAKE NO CLAIM TO ARCHITECTURAL BEAUTY THEY ARE IN THEIR PERFECT TEMPORARINESS

BenKatchor_2002@357.76:368.17 THE TEMPORARY BUILDING IS A TRIUMPH OF MODERN INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION A HEALTHY SUBLIMATION OF THE URGE TO BUILD

BenKatchor_2002@386.31:396.37 THE LAP WAS A PLATFORM UPON WHICH TO PLACE THE EARTHLY POSSESSIONS OF THE DEAD THIRTY CUBITS FROM FOOT TO KNEE
