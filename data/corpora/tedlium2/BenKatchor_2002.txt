BenKatchor_2002 I'M GOING TO READ A FEW STRIPS THESE ARE MOST OF THESE ARE FROM A MONTHLY PAGE I DO IN AND ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN MAGAZINE
BenKatchor_2002 CALLED METROPOLIS AND THE FIRST STORY IS CALLED THE FAULTY SWITCH ANOTHER BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED NEW BUILDING RUINED BY THE SOUND OF A COMMON WALL LIGHT SWITCH
BenKatchor_2002 IT'S FINE DURING THE DAY WHEN THE MAIN ROOMS ARE FLOODED WITH SUNLIGHT BUT AT DUSK EVERYTHING CHANGES THE
BenKatchor_2002 HUNDREDS OF HOURS DESIGNING THE BURNISHED BRASS SWITCHPLATES
BenKatchor_2002 FOR HIS NEW OFFICE TOWER AND THEN LEFT IT TO A CONTRACTOR TO INSTALL THESE SEVENTY NINE CENT SWITCHES BEHIND THEM WE KNOW
BenKatchor_2002 WHERE TO REACH WHEN WE ENTER A DARK ROOM WE AUTOMATICALLY THROW THE LITTLE NUB OF PLASTIC UPWARD BUT THE SOUND WE ARE GREETED WITH AS THE ROOM IS BATHED
BenKatchor_2002 IN THE SIMULATED GLOW OF LATE AFTERNOON LIGHT RECALLS TO MIND A DIRTY MEN 'S ROOM IN THE REAR OF A GREEK COFFEE SHOP
BenKatchor_2002 THIS SOUND COLORS OUR FIRST IMPRESSION OF ANY ROOM IT CAN'T BE HELPED BUT WHERE DOES THIS SOUND COMMONLY DESCRIBED AS A CLICK
BenKatchor_2002 COME FROM IS IS SIMPLY THE BYPRODUCT OF A CRUDE MECHANICAL ACTION
BenKatchor_2002 OR IS IT AN IMITATION OF ONE HALF A SET OF SOUNDS WE MAKE TO EXPRESS DISAPPOINTMENT THE OFTEN DEDENTAL CONSONANT OF NO INDO EUROPEAN LANGUAGE
BenKatchor_2002 OR IS IT THE AMPLIFIED SOUND OF A SYNAPSE FIRING IN THE BRAIN OF A COCKROACH
BenKatchor_2002 IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES THEY TRIED THEIR BEST TO MUFFLE THIS SOUND WITH MERCURY SWITCHES
BenKatchor_2002 AND SILENT KNOB CONTROLS BUT TODAY THESE IMPROVEMENTS SEEM SOMEHOW INAUTHENTIC
BenKatchor_2002 THE CLICK IS THE MODERN TRIUMPHAL CLARION PROCEEDING US THROUGH LIFE ANNOUNCING OUR ENTRY INTO EVERY LIGHTLESS ROOM
BenKatchor_2002 THE SOUND MADE FLICKING A WALL SWITCH OFF IS OF A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NATURE
BenKatchor_2002 IT HAS A DEEP MELANCHOLY RING CHILDREN DON'T LIKE IT IT'S WHY THEY LEAVE LIGHTS ON AROUND THE HOUSE
BenKatchor_2002 ADULTS FIND IT COMFORTING BUT WOULDN'T IT BE AN EASY MATTER TO WIRE A WALL SWITCH SO THAT IT TRIGGERS THE MUTED HORN OF A STEAM SHIP OR THE RECORDED CROWING OF A ROOSTER
BenKatchor_2002 THE DISTANT PEEL OF THUNDER THOMAS
BenKatchor_2002 EDISON WENT THROUGH THOUSANDS OF UNLIKELY SUBSTANCES BEFORE HE CAME UPON THE RIGHT ONE FOR THE FILAMENT OF HIS ELECTRIC LIGHTBULB
BenKatchor_2002 WHY HAVE WE SETTLED SO QUICKLY FOR THE SOUND OF ITS SWITCH THAT'S THE END
BenKatchor_2002 PRAISE OF THE TAXPAYER THAT SO MANY OF THE CITY 'S MOST VENERABLE TAXPAYERS HAVE SURVIVED YET ANOTHER COMMERCIAL BUILDING BOOM IS CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION
BenKatchor_2002 THESE ONE OR TWO STORY STRUCTURES DESIGNED TO YIELD ONLY ENOUGH INCOME TO COVER THE TAXES ON THE LAND ON WHICH THEY STAND WERE NOT MEANT TO BE PERMANENT BUILDINGS
BenKatchor_2002 YET FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER THEY HAVE CONFOUNDED THE EFFORTS OF DEVELOPERS TO BE COMBINED INTO LOTS SUITABLE FOR HIGH RISE CONSTRUCTION
BenKatchor_2002 ALTHOUGH THEY MAKE NO CLAIM TO ARCHITECTURAL BEAUTY THEY ARE IN THEIR PERFECT TEMPORARINESS
BenKatchor_2002 A DELIGHTFUL ALTERNATIVE TO THE LARGE SCALE STRUCTURES THAT MIGHT SOMEDAY TAKE THEIR PLACE
BenKatchor_2002 THE MOST PERFECT EXAMPLES OCCUPY CORNER LOTS
BenKatchor_2002 THEY OFFER A PLEASANT RESPITE FROM THE HIGH DENSITY DEVELOPMENT AROUND THEM A BREAK OF LIGHT AND AIR AN ARCHITECTURAL BIDING OF TIME
BenKatchor_2002 SO BURIED IN SIGNAGE ARE THESE STRUCTURES THAT IT OFTEN TAKES A MOMENT TO DISTINGUISH THE MODERN SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED TAXPAYER FROM ITS NEIGHBOR
BenKatchor_2002 THE SMALL COMMERCIAL BUILDING FROM AN EARLIER CENTURY WHOSE UPPER FLOORS HAVE BEEN SEALED AND WHOSE GROUNDFLOOR SPACE NOW FUNCTIONS AS A TAXPAYER
BenKatchor_2002 THE FEW SURFACES NOT COVERED BY SIGNS ARE OFTEN CLAD IN A DISTINCTIVE DARK GREEN GRAY STRIATED ALUMINUM SIDING
BenKatchor_2002 TAKE OUT SANDWICH SHOPS FILM PROCESSING DROP OFFS PEEP SHOWS AND NECKTIE STORES
BenKatchor_2002 NOW THESE PROVISIONAL STRUCTURES HAVE IN SOME CASES REMAINED STANDING FOR THE BETTER PART OF A HUMAN LIFETIME
BenKatchor_2002 THE TEMPORARY BUILDING IS A TRIUMPH OF MODERN INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION A HEALTHY SUBLIMATION OF THE URGE TO BUILD
BenKatchor_2002 AND PROOF THAT NOT EVERY ARCHITECTURAL IDEA NEED BE SET IN STONE THAT'S THE END
BenKatchor_2002 THE LAP WAS A PLATFORM UPON WHICH TO PLACE THE EARTHLY POSSESSIONS OF THE DEAD THIRTY CUBITS FROM FOOT TO KNEE
BenKatchor_2002 IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY THAT AN ITALIAN PAINTER RECOGNIZED THE LAP AS A GRECIAN TEMPLE UPHOLSTERED IN FLESH AND CLOTH
BenKatchor_2002 OVER THE NEXT TWO HUNDRED YEARS WE SEE THE INFANT CHRIST GO FROM A SITTING TO A STANDING POSITION ON THE VIRGIN 'S LAP AND THEN BACK AGAIN
BenKatchor_2002 EVERY CHILD RECAPITULATES THIS ASCENSION STRADDLING ONE OR BOTH LEGS SITTING SIDEWAYS OR LEANING AGAINST THE BODY
BenKatchor_2002 FROM THERE TO THE MODERN VENTRILOQUIST 'S DUMMY IS BUT A BRIEF MOMENT IN HISTORY YOU WERE LATE FOR SCHOOL AGAIN THIS MORNING
BenKatchor_2002 THE VENTRILOQUIST MUST FIRST MAKE US BELIEVE THAT A SMALL BOY IS SITTING ON HIS LAP THE ILLUSION OF SPEECH FOLLOWS INCIDENTALLY
BenKatchor_2002 WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY FOR YOURSELF JIMMY AS ADULTS WE ADMIRE THE LAP FROM A NOSTALGIC DISTANCE
BenKatchor_2002 WE HAVE FADING MEMORIES OF THAT PROVISIONAL TEMPLE ERECTED EACH TIME AN ADULT SAT DOWN ON A CROWDED BUS THERE WAS ALWAYS A
BenKatchor_2002 TO SIT
BenKatchor_2002 CHILDREN AND TEENAGE GIRLS WHO ARE MOST KEENLY AWARE OF ITS ARCHITECTURAL BEAUTY
BenKatchor_2002 THEY UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF A DEEP AVUNCULAR LAP AS COMPARED TO THE SHAKY ARANGEMENT OF A NEUROTIC NIECE IN HIGH HEELS
BenKatchor_2002 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LAP AND ITS OWNER IS DIRECT AND INTIMATE I ENVISION A THIRTY SIX STORY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY UNIT RESIDENTIAL HIGH
BenKatchor_2002 A REASON TO CONSIDER THE MENTAL HEALTH OF ANY ARCHITECT BEFORE GRANTING AN IMPORTANT COMMISSION THE BATHROOMS AND KITCHENS WILL OF COURSE HAVE NO WINDOWS
BenKatchor_2002 THE LAP OF LUXURY IS AN ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRUCT OF CHILDHOOD WHICH WE SEEK IN VAIN AS ADULTS TO EMPLOY THAT'S THE END
BenKatchor_2002 THE
BenKatchor_2002 SERVES AS THE TEMPORARY RESTING PLACE FOR THE HAVERPIECE COLLECTION OF EUROPEAN DRIED FRUIT
BenKatchor_2002 THE PROFOUND CONVOLUTIONS ON THE SURFACE OF A DRIED CHERRY THE FOREBODING SHEEN OF AN EXTRA LARGE DATE
BenKatchor_2002 DO YOU REMEMBER WANDERING AS A CHILD THROUGH THOSE DARK WOODEN STOREFRONT GALLERIES WHERE EVERYTHING WAS DISPLAYED
BenKatchor_2002 IN POORLY LABELED ROACH PROOF BINS PEARS DRIED IN THE FORM OF GENITAL ORGANS

BenKatchor_2002 AS AN ART FORM IT LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN STILL LIFE PAINTING AND PLUMBING
