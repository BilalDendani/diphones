Bono_2005@13.19:13.52 WELL
Bono_2005@28.28:36.71 THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS ANOTHER FAMOUS MAN JERRY GARCIA SAID WHAT A STRANGE LONG TRIP
Bono_2005@37.37:48.28 AND HE SHOULD HAVE SAID WHAT A STRANGE LONG TRIP IT'S ABOUT TO BECOME AT THIS VERY MOMENT YOU ARE VIEWING MY UPPER HALF MY LOWER HALF IS APPEARING AT A DIFFERENT
Bono_2005@56.08:63.30 TWO PLACES AT ONCE BUT STILL I'M SORRY I CAN'T BE WITH YOU IN PERSON I'LL EXPLAIN AT ANOTHER
Bono_2005@64.13:74.59 TIME AND THOUGH I'M A ROCK STAR I JUST WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT NONE OF MY WISHES WILL INCLUDE A HOT TUB BUT WHAT REALLY TURNS ME ON ABOUT TECHNOLOGY
Bono_2005@75.11:84.15 IS NOT JUST THE ABILITY TO GET MORE SONGS ON MP THREE PLAYERS THE REVOLUTION THIS REVOLUTION IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT
Bono_2005@109.57:118.18 IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE A FILM YOU NEEDED A MASS OF EQUIPMENT AND A HOLLYWOOD BUDGET NOW YOU NEED A CAMERA THAT FITS IN YOUR
Bono_2005@119.18:124.57 AND A COUPLE OF BUCKS FOR A BLANK DVD IMAGINATION HAS BEEN
Bono_2005@125.65:133.93 FROM THE OLD CONSTRAINTS AND THAT REALLY REALLY EXCITES ME I'M EXCITED WHEN I GLIMPSE THAT KIND OF THINKING
Bono_2005@134.28:147.13 WRIT LARGE WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS IDEALISM DECOUPLED FROM ALL CONSTRAINTS POLITICAL ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGICAL WHATEVER
Bono_2005@147.79:152.66 THE GEOPOLITICAL WORLD HAS GOT A LOT TO LEARN FROM THE DIGITAL WORLD FROM THE
Bono_2005@153.68:162.08 WITH WHICH YOU SWEPT AWAY OBSTACLES THAT NO ONE KNEW COULD EVEN BE BUDGED AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY
Bono_2005@163.65:167.56 FIRST THOUGH I SHOULD PROBABLY EXPLAIN WHY
Bono_2005@167.93:177.49 AND HOW I GOT TO THIS PLACE IT'S A JOURNEY THAT STARTED TWENTY YEARS AGO
Bono_2005@178.88:186.92 YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT SONG WE ARE THE WORLD OR DO THEY KNOW IT'S CHRISTMAS BAND AID LIVE AID ANOTHER VERY TALL
Bono_2005@195.10:204.16 WAS A GREAT MOMENT AND IT UTTERLY CHANGED MY LIFE THAT SUMMER MY WIFE ALI AND MYSELF WENT TO ETHIOPIA
Bono_2005@206.46:218.37 WE WENT ON THE QUIET TO SEE FOR OURSELVES WHAT WAS GOING ON WE LIVED IN ETHIOPIA FOR A MONTH WORKING AT AN ORPHANAGE THE CHILDREN HAD A NAME FOR ME THEY CALLED ME THE GIRL WITH THE
Bono_2005@221.84:227.55 DON'T ASK ANYWAY WE FOUND AFRICA TO BE A MAGICAL PLACE
Bono_2005@229.75:235.86 BIG SHINING CONTINENT BEAUTIFUL ROYAL PEOPLE ANYBODY WHO EVER GAVE ANYTHING
Bono_2005@236.74:244.39 TO AFRICA GOT A LOT MORE BACK ETHIOPIA DIDN'T JUST BLOW MY MIND IT OPENED MY MIND
Bono_2005@245.81:252.31 ANYWAY ON OUR LAST DAY AT THIS ORPHANAGE A MAN HANDED ME HIS BABY AND SAID
Bono_2005@254.41:267.27 WOULD YOU TAKE MY SON WITH YOU HE KNEW IN IRELAND THAT HIS SON WOULD LIVE AND THAT IN ETHIOPIA HIS SON WOULD DIE IT WAS THE MIDDLE OF THAT AWFUL FAMINE
Bono_2005@269.77:270.08 WELL
Bono_2005@270.68:274.79 I TURNED HIM DOWN AND
Bono_2005@278.21:285.31 WAS A FUNNY KIND OF SICK FEELING BUT I TURNED HIM DOWN AND IT'S A FEELING I CAN'T EVER QUITE FORGET
Bono_2005@285.78:294.50 AND IN THAT MOMENT I STARTED THIS JOURNEY IN THAT MOMENT I BECAME THE WORST THING OF ALL I BECAME A ROCK STAR WITH
Bono_2005@297.80:305.86 EXCEPT THIS ISN'T THE CAUSE IS IT SIX AND A HALF THOUSAND AFRICANS DYING EVERY SINGLE DAY FROM AIDS
Bono_2005@306.13:311.97 A PREVENTABLE TREATABLE DISEASE FOR LACK OF DRUGS WE CAN GET IN ANY PHARMACY
Bono_2005@312.61:321.88 THAT'S NOT A CAUSE THAT'S AN EMERGENCY ELEVEN MILLION AIDS ORPHANS IN AFRICA TWENTY MILLION BY THE END OF THE DECADE THAT'S NOT A CAUSE
Bono_2005@336.24:337.13 AN EMERGENCY
Bono_2005@338.71:346.04 SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS HUMAN RIGHTS THE RIGHT TO LIVE LIKE A HUMAN
Bono_2005@346.64:356.41 THE RIGHT TO LIVE PERIOD AND WHAT WE'RE FACING IN AFRICA IS AN UNPRECEDENTED THREAT TO HUMAN DIGNITY AND EQUALITY
Bono_2005@367.37:374.90 THIS IS ABOUT JUSTICE REALLY THIS IS NOT ABOUT CHARITY THIS IS ABOUT JUSTICE
Bono_2005@375.70:383.68 THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT'S TOO BAD BECAUSE WE'RE VERY GOOD AT CHARITY AMERICANS LIKE IRISH PEOPLE ARE GOOD
Bono_2005@384.67:392.86 EVEN THE POOREST NEIGHBORHOODS GIVE MORE THAN THEY CAN AFFORD WE LIKE TO GIVE AND WE GIVE A LOT LOOK AT THE RESPONSE TO THE TSUNAMI IT'S INSPIRING
Bono_2005@394.48:403.93 BUT JUSTICE IS A TOUGHER STANDARD THAN CHARITY YOU SEE AFRICA MAKES A FOOL OF OUR IDEA OF JUSTICE
Bono_2005@404.54:411.32 IT MAKES A FARCE OF OUR IDEA OF EQUALITY IT MOCKS OUR PIETIES IT DOUBTS OUR CONCERN IT QUESTIONS OUR
Bono_2005@413.17:421.87 BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY WE CAN LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AFRICA AND IF WE'RE HONEST CONCLUDE THAT IT WOULD EVER BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN ANYWHERE ELSE
Bono_2005@422.30:428.67 AS YOU HEARD IN THE FILM ANYWHERE ELSE NOT HERE NOT HERE NOT IN AMERICA NOT IN EUROPE
Bono_2005@430.45:437.01 A HEAD OF STATE THAT YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH ADMITTED THIS TO ME
Bono_2005@438.40:446.74 REALLY TRUE THERE IS NO CHANCE THIS KIND OF HEMORRHAGING OF HUMAN LIFE WOULD BE ACCEPTED ANYWHERE ELSE OTHER THAN AFRICA
Bono_2005@448.07:461.04 AFRICA IS A CONTINENT IN FLAMES AND DEEP DOWN IF WE REALLY ACCEPTED THAT AFRICANS WERE EQUAL TO US WE WOULD ALL DO MORE TO PUT THE FIRE OUT WE'RE STANDING AROUND WITH WATERING CANS
Bono_2005@461.76:468.60 WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS THE FIRE BRIGADE YOU SEE IT'S NOT AS DRAMATIC AS THE TSUNAMI
Bono_2005@470.34:476.14 CRAZY REALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT DOES STUFF HAVE TO LOOK LIKE AN ACTION MOVIE THESE DAYS
Bono_2005@476.48:485.10 TO EXIST IN THE FRONT OF OUR BRAIN THE SLOW EXTINGUISHING OF COUNTLESS LIVES IS JUST NOT DRAMATIC ENOUGH IT WOULD APPEAR
Bono_2005@495.40:503.30 ANYWAY I BELIEVE THAT THAT KIND OF THINKING OFFENDS THE INTELLECTUAL RIGOR IN THIS ROOM
Bono_2005@516.48:527.42 I WANT TO ARGUE WITH YOU TONIGHT THAT THAT'S OUR CRISIS I WANT TO ARGUE THAT THOUGH AFRICA IS NOT THE FRONT LINE IN THE WAR AGAINST TERROR IT COULD BE SOON
Bono_2005@528.30:535.89 EVERY WEEK RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS TAKE ANOTHER AFRICAN VILLAGE THEY'RE ATTEMPTING TO BRING ORDER TO CHAOS WELL
Bono_2005@536.89:545.84 WHY AREN'T WE POVERTY BREEDS DESPAIR WE KNOW THIS DESPAIR BREEDS VIOLENCE WE KNOW THIS IN TURBULENT TIMES ISN'T IT CHEAPER
Bono_2005@546.43:559.30 AND SMARTER TO MAKE FRIENDS OUT OF POTENTIAL ENEMIES THAN TO DEFEND YOURSELF AGAINST THEM LATER THE WAR AGAINST TERROR IS BOUND UP IN THE WAR AGAINST POVERTY
Bono_2005@560.86:568.13 AND I DIDN'T SAY THAT COLIN POWELL SAID THAT NOW WHEN THE MILITARY ARE TELLING US THAT THIS IS A WAR THAT CANNOT BE WON
Bono_2005@568.52:574.96 BY MILITARY MIGHT ALONE MAYBE WE SHOULD LISTEN THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HERE
Bono_2005@575.60:587.45 AND IT'S REAL IT'S NOT SPIN IT'S NOT WISHFUL THINKING THE PROBLEMS FACING THE DEVELOPING WORLD AFFORD US IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD A CHANCE TO RE DESCRIBE OURSELVES TO THE WORLD
Bono_2005@588.96:600.08 WE WILL NOT ONLY TRANSFORM OTHER PEOPLE 'S LIVES BUT WE WILL ALSO TRANSFORM THE WAY THOSE OTHER LIVES SEE US AND THAT MIGHT BE SMART IN THESE NERVOUS DANGEROUS TIMES
Bono_2005@600.84:607.18 DON'T YOU THINK THAT ON A PURELY COMMERCIAL LEVEL THAT ANTI RETROVIRAL DRUGS
Bono_2005@607.62:615.57 GREAT ADVERTISEMENTS FOR WESTERN INGENUITY AND TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T COMPASSION LOOK WELL ON US AND LET 'S CUT THE
Bono_2005@616.73:629.66 CRAP FOR A SECOND IN CERTAIN QUARTERS OF THE WORLD BRAND EU BRAND USA IS NOT AT ITS SHINIEST THE NEON SIGN IS FIZZING AND
Bono_2005@631.73:633.65 SOMEONE 'S PUT A BRICK THROUGH THE WINDOW
Bono_2005@634.14:637.05 THE REGIONAL BRANCH MANAGERS ARE GETTING NERVOUS
Bono_2005@638.04:645.87 NEVER BEFORE HAVE WE IN THE WEST BEEN SO SCRUTINIZED OUR VALUES DO WE HAVE ANY OUR CREDIBILITY
Bono_2005@646.38:655.19 THESE THINGS ARE UNDER ATTACK AROUND THE WORLD BRAND USA COULD USE SOME POLISHING AND I SAY THAT AS A FAN YOU KNOW
Bono_2005@655.49:664.87 AS A PERSON WHO BUYS THE PRODUCTS BUT THINK ABOUT IT MORE ANTI RETROVIRALS MAKE SENSE BUT THAT'S JUST THE EASY PART
Bono_2005@668.54:674.12 EQUALITY FOR AFRICA THAT'S A BIG EXPENSIVE IDEA
Bono_2005@675.27:682.45 YOU SEE THE SCALE OF THE SUFFERING NUMBS US INTO A KIND OF INDIFFERENCE WHAT ON EARTH CAN WE ALL DO
Bono_2005@684.73:694.82 WELL MUCH MORE THAN WE THINK WE CAN'T FIX EVERY PROBLEM BUT THE ONES WE CAN I WANT TO ARGUE WE MUST AND BECAUSE WE CAN WE MUST
Bono_2005@695.98:708.87 THIS IS THE STRAIGHT TRUTH THE RIGHTEOUS TRUTH IT IS NOT A THEORY THE FACT IS THAT OURS IS THE FIRST GENERATION THAT CAN LOOK DISEASE AND EXTREME POVERTY IN THE EYE
Bono_2005@709.45:720.98 LOOK ACROSS THE OCEAN TO AFRICA AND SAY THIS AND MEAN IT WE DO NOT HAVE TO STAND FOR THIS A WHOLE CONTINENT WRITTEN OFF WE DO NOT HAVE TO STAND FOR THIS
Bono_2005@732.08:740.17 LET ME SAY THIS WITHOUT A TRACE OF IRONY BEFORE I BACK IT UP TO A BUNCH OF EX HIPPIES
Bono_2005@740.69:749.84 FORGET THE SIXTIES WE CAN CHANGE THE WORLD I CAN 'T YOU CAN 'T AS INDIVIDUALS BUT WE
Bono_2005@750.18:758.28 CAN CHANGE THE WORLD I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM LOOK AT THE GATES FOUNDATION THEY'VE DONE INCREDIBLE STUFF UNBELIEVABLE STUFF
Bono_2005@758.64:766.13 BUT WORKING TOGETHER WE CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE WORLD WE CAN TURN THE INEVITABLE OUTCOMES
Bono_2005@767.99:776.01 AND TRANSFORM THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR MILLIONS OF LIVES WHO LOOK AND FEEL RATHER LIKE US WHEN
Bono_2005@778.35:786.89 I'M SORRY TO LAUGH HERE BUT YOU DO LOOK SO DIFFERENT THAN YOU DID IN HAIGHT ASHBURY IN THE SIXTIES
Bono_2005@788.85:800.71 BUT I WANT TO ARGUE THAT THIS IS THE MOMENT THAT YOU ARE DESIGNED FOR IT IS THE FLOWERING OF THE SEEDS YOU PLANTED IN EARLIER HEADIER DAYS
Bono_2005@802.70:816.81 IDEAS THAT YOU GESTATED IN YOUR YOUTH THIS IS WHAT EXCITES ME THIS ROOM WAS BORN FOR THIS MOMENT IS REALLY WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO YOU TONIGHT MOST OF YOU STARTED OUT WANTING TO CHANGE THE WORLD
Bono_2005@818.07:821.42 MOST OF YOU DID THE DIGITAL WORLD WELL NOW
Bono_2005@822.23:825.81 ACTUALLY BECAUSE OF YOU IT IS POSSIBLE TO CHANGE THE PHYSICAL
Bono_2005@830.75:833.92 AND THEY KNOW MUCH MORE THAN I DO SO
Bono_2005@834.79:848.93 WHY THEN ARE WE NOT PUMPING OUR FISTS INTO THE AIR PROBABLY BECAUSE WHEN WE ADMIT WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT IT IS
Bono_2005@850.38:864.51 PAIN IN THE ARSE THIS EQUALITY BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY A PAIN IN THE ARSE BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE THE KNOW HOW WE HAVE THE CASH WE HAVE THE LIFE SAVING DRUGS
Bono_2005@866.11:870.38 DO WE HAVE THE WILL I HOPE THIS IS OBVIOUS BUT
Bono_2005@872.98:886.57 I'M NOT A HIPPIE AND I'M NOT REALLY ONE FOR THE WARM FUZZY FEELING I DO NOT HAVE FLOWERS IN MY HAIR ACTUALLY I COME FROM PUNK ROCK THE CLASH WORE BIG ARMY BOOTS NOT
Bono_2005@888.72:896.41 BUT I KNOW TOUGHNESS WHEN I SEE IT AND FOR ALL THE TALK OF PEACE AND LOVE ON THE WEST COAST THERE WAS MUSCLE
Bono_2005@898.29:907.10 TO THE MOVEMENT THAT STARTED OUT HERE YOU SEE IDEALISM DETACHED FROM ACTION IS JUST A DREAM
Bono_2005@907.81:914.46 BUT IDEALISM ALLIED WITH PRAGMATISM WITH ROLLING UP YOUR SLEEVES AND MAKING THE WORLD BEND A BIT IS
Bono_2005@916.13:924.80 VERY EXCITING IT'S VERY REAL IT'S VERY STRONG AND IT'S VERY PRESENT IN A CROWD LIKE YOU
Bono_2005@926.25:939.57 LAST YEAR AT DATA THIS ORGANIZATION I HELPED SET UP WE LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN TO SUMMON THIS SPIRIT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST AIDS AND EXTREME POVERTY WE'RE CALLING IT THE ONE CAMPAIGN
Bono_2005@940.25:951.51 IT'S BASED ON OUR BELIEF THAT THE ACTION OF ONE PERSON CAN CHANGE A LOT BUT THE ACTIONS OF MANY COMING TOGETHER AS ONE CAN CHANGE THE WORLD
Bono_2005@952.35:962.86 WELL WE FEEL THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO PROVE WE'RE RIGHT THERE ARE MOMENTS IN HISTORY WHEN CIVILIZATION REDEFINES ITSELF
Bono_2005@963.43:972.80 WE BELIEVE THIS IS ONE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS COULD BE THE TIME WHEN THE WORLD FINALLY DECIDES THAT THE WANTON LOSS OF LIFE IN AFRICA IS JUST NO LONGER
Bono_2005@982.19:992.13 WHO LIVE ON PLANET EARTH MOMENTUM HAS BEEN BUILDING LURCHING A LITTLE BUT IT'S BUILDING THIS YEAR IS A TEST FOR US ALL
Bono_2005@992.78:998.50 ESPECIALLY THE LEADERS OF THE G EIGHT NATIONS WHO REALLY ARE ON THE LINE HERE
Bono_2005@998.93:1000.64 WITH ALL THE WORLD IN HISTORY WATCHING
Bono_2005@1001.80:1005.88 I HAVE BEEN OF LATE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION
Bono_2005@1006.52:1015.07 THEY STARTED OUT WITH SUCH PROMISE ON AFRICA THEY MADE SOME REALLY GREAT PROMISES AND ACTUALLY HAVE FULFILLED A LOT OF THEM
Bono_2005@1015.42:1022.01 BUT SOME OF THEM THEY HAVEN 'T THEY DON'T FEEL THE PUSH FROM THE GROUND IS THE TRUTH
Bono_2005@1024.99:1033.20 BUT MY DISAPPOINTMENT HAS MUCH MORE PERSPECTIVE WHEN I TALK TO AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I HEAR THEIR WORRIES ABOUT THE DEFICIT
Bono_2005@1033.66:1043.44 THE FISCAL WELL BEING OF THEIR COUNTRY I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THERE'S MUCH MORE PUSH FROM THE GROUND THAN YOU'D THINK IF WE GOT ORGANIZED
Bono_2005@1044.83:1058.89 WHAT I TRY TO COMMUNICATE AND YOU CAN HELP ME IF YOU AGREE IS THAT AID FOR AFRICA IS JUST GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY AT A TIME WHEN AMERICA REALLY NEEDS IT PUTTING IT IN THE CRASSEST POSSIBLE TERMS
Bono_2005@1059.55:1070.98 THE INVESTMENT REAPS HUGE RETURNS NOT ONLY IN LIVES SAVED BUT IN GOODWILL STABILITY AND SECURITY THAT WE'LL GAIN
Bono_2005@1072.46:1081.91 SO THIS IS WHAT I HOPE THAT YOU WILL DO IF I COULD BE SO BOLD AND NOT HAVE IT DEDUCTED FROM MY NUMBER OF WISHES
Bono_2005@1084.28:1094.69 WHAT I HOPE IS THAT BEYOND INDIVIDUAL MERCIFUL ACTS THAT YOU WILL TELL THE POLITICIANS TO DO RIGHT BY
Bono_2005@1095.87:1097.80 BY AMERICA AND BY THE WORLD
Bono_2005@1098.56:1104.43 GIVE THEM PERMISSION IF YOU LIKE TO SPEND THEIR POLITICAL CAPITAL AND YOUR FINANCIAL
Bono_2005@1105.18:1119.46 YOUR NATIONAL PURSE ON SAVING THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT'S REALLY WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO BECAUSE WE ALSO NEED YOUR INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL YOUR IDEAS YOUR SKILLS YOUR INGENUITY
Bono_2005@1120.18:1127.10 AND YOU AT THIS CONFERENCE ARE IN A UNIQUE POSITION SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGIES WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT YOU INVENTED
Bono_2005@1137.92:1142.20 PUSHED THE BOUNDARIES AND WE'D LIKE YOU TO
Bono_2005@1167.39:1173.74 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING TOGETHER AND WORKING UNDER THIS UMBRELLA I TOLD YOU ABOUT EARLIER THE ONE CAMPAIGN
Bono_2005@1176.18:1182.65 I THINK THEY JUST HAVE ONE IDEA IN THEIR MIND WHICH IS
Bono_2005@1183.84:1189.44 WHERE YOU LIVE IN THE WORLD SHOULD NOT DETERMINE WHETHER YOU LIVE
Bono_2005@1195.30:1195.92 LIKE
Bono_2005@1196.86:1206.53 GOD IS WATCHING WHAT WE DO WHEN THE HISTORY BOOKS GET WRITTEN I THINK OUR AGE WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR THREE THINGS REALLY IT'S JUST THREE THINGS
Bono_2005@1207.78:1216.49 THIS WHOLE AGE WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION YES THE WAR AGAINST TERROR YES AND WHAT WE DID
Bono_2005@1217.55:1220.24 OR DID NOT DO TO PUT OUT THE FIRES
Bono_2005@1222.10:1226.80 SOME SAY WE CAN'T AFFORD TO I SAY

Bono_2005@1256.48:1263.03 THE CREATIVE IMAGINATION FROM THE PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS OF MATTER THIS SHOULD BE A PIECE
Bono_2005@1268.93:1269.80 THAT THIS STARTED OUT AS A
Bono_2005@1270.88:1277.20 WISHES MOST OF THEM IMPOSSIBLE SOME OF THEM IMPRACTICAL AND ONE OR TWO OF THEM CERTAINLY IMMORAL

Bono_2005@1529.94:1540.60 TO TRULY SHOW THE POWER OF INFORMATION ITS POWER TO REWRITE THE RULES AND TRANSFORM LIVES BY CONNECTING EVERY HOSPITAL HEALTH
Bono_2005@1541.74:1550.31 AND SCHOOL IN ONE AFRICAN COUNTRY AND I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE ETHIOPIA I BELIEVE
Bono_2005@1551.09:1565.27 WE CAN CONNECT EVERY SCHOOL IN ETHIOPIA EVERY HEALTH CLINIC EVERY HOSPITAL WE CAN CONNECT TO THE INTERNET THAT IS MY WISH MY THIRD WISH I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE I THINK WE HAVE THE MONEY AND BRAINS IN THE ROOM TO DO THAT
Bono_2005@1565.78:1577.82 AND THAT WOULD BE A MIND BLOWING WISH TO COME TRUE I'VE BEEN TO ETHIOPIA AS I SAID EARLIER IT'S ACTUALLY WHERE IT ALL STARTED FOR ME
Bono_2005@1581.15:1587.13 THE IDEA THAT THE INTERNET WHICH CHANGED ALL OF OUR LIVES CAN TRANSFORM A COUNTRY
Bono_2005@1588.15:1597.34 AND A CONTINENT THAT HAS HARDLY MADE IT TO ANALOG LET ALONE DIGITAL BLOWS MY MIND BUT IT DIDN'T START
Bono_2005@1608.12:1617.80 WAS JUST NINE YEARS LATER THAT ADDIS ABABA WAS CONNECTED BY PHONE TO HARARE WHICH IS FIVE HUNDRED KILOMETERS AWAY
Bono_2005@1618.92:1628.26 SINCE THEN NOT THAT MUCH HAS CHANGED THE AVERAGE WAITING TIME TO GET A LAND LINE IN ETHIOPIA IS ACTUALLY ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT
Bono_2005@1630.79:1640.31 WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY WASN'T DREAMT UP THEN ANYWAY I'M IRISH AND AS YOU CAN SEE I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT TALKING IS
