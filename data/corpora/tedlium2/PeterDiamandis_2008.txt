PeterDiamandis_2008 AND I SAID I CAN'T TAKE YOU THERE BUT I CAN TAKE YOU INTO WEIGHTLESSNESS INTO ZERO G AND HE SAID ON THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY YES WELL THE ONLY WAY TO EXPERIENCE ZERO G ON EARTH IS ACTUALLY WITH PARABOLIC FLIGHT WEIGHTLESS FLIGHT
PeterDiamandis_2008 YOU TAKE AN AIRPLANE YOU FLY OVER THE TOP YOU'RE WEIGHTLESS FOR TWENTY FIVE SECONDS COME BACK DOWN YOU WEIGH TWICE AS MUCH YOU DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN YOU CAN GET EIGHT TEN MINUTES WEIGHTLESSNESS HOW NASA'S TRAINED THEIR ASTRONAUTS FOR SO LONG
