AfraRaymond_2012X@31.89:40.24 CONTEXT YOUR FRIENDS YOUR FAMILY OR YOUR FINANCIERS OKAY FRIENDS FAMILY AND FINANCIERS
AfraRaymond_2012X@40.24:43.84 NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT CORRUPTION
AfraRaymond_2012X@43.84:56.88 AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE BEEN MISEDUCATED ABOUT IT AND WE HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO ADMIT THAT TO START CHANGING HOW WE DEAL WITH IT THE FIRST THING IS THAT THE BIG MYTH NUMBER ONE
AfraRaymond_2012X@56.88:69.38 IS THAT IN FACT IT 'S NOT REALLY A CRIME WHEN WE GET TOGETHER WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND WE DISCUSS CRIME IN OUR COUNTRY CRIME IN BELMONT OR CRIME IN DIEGO OR CRIME IN MARABELLA NOBODY 'S SPEAKING ABOUT CORRUPTION THAT 'S THE HONEST TRUTH
AfraRaymond_2012X@109.88:120.49 THE SECOND IMPORTANT MYTH TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DESTROY THESE MYTHS DISMANTLE THEM AND DESTROY THEM AND RIDICULE THEM THE SECOND IMPORTANT MYTH TO UNDERSTAND IS THE ONE THAT SAYS THAT
AfraRaymond_2012X@139.08:149.43 THAT THAT TOO IS A DANGEROUS MYTH VERY DANGEROUS IT 'S A PIECE OF PUBLIC MISCHIEF AND I WANT TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TAKE US BACK ABOUT THIRTY YEARS
AfraRaymond_2012X@197.15:202.57 THE FIRST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THAT WHEN ALL OF THIS MONEY FLOWED INTO OUR COUNTRY ABOUT FORTY YEARS AGO
AfraRaymond_2012X@202.57:209.21 WE EMBARKED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY EMBARKED ON A SERIES OF GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE RAPIDLY DEVELOP THE COUNTRY
AfraRaymond_2012X@228.1:243.94 IT BECAME SO OUTRAGEOUS THE WHOLE SITUATION THAT IN FACT A COMMISSION OF INQUIRY WAS APPOINTED AND IT REPORTED IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO THIRTY YEARS AGO IT REPORTED THE BALLAH REPORT THIRTY YEARS AGO AND IMMEDIATELY THE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS WERE STOPPED
AfraRaymond_2012X@261.03:265.12 'S WHAT HE TOLD US HE TOLD US THAT IN FACT
AfraRaymond_2012X@273.72:277.36 SO THE TEN OR FIFTEEN PERCENT IS PURE MISCHIEF
AfraRaymond_2012X@277.36:295.05 AS WE SAY IT 'S A NANCY STORY FORGET IT THAT 'S FOR LITTLE CHILDREN WE ARE BIG PEOPLE AND WE 'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH WHAT 'S HAPPENING IN OUR SOCIETY OKAY THIS IS THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM OKAY TWO THIRDS OF THE MONEY STOLEN OR WASTED THAT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO WAS BALLAH SO WHAT HAS CHANGED
AfraRaymond_2012X@295.05:299.41 I DON 'T LIKE TO BRING UP EMBARRASSING SECRETS TO AN INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE BUT I HAVE TO
AfraRaymond_2012X@299.41:316.4 FOUR MONTHS AGO WE SUFFERED A CONSTITUTIONAL OUTRAGE IN THIS COUNTRY WE CALL IT THE SECTION THIRTY FOUR FIASCO THE SECTION THIRTY FOUR FIASCO A SUSPICIOUS PIECE OF LAW AND I 'M GOING TO SAY IT LIKE IT IS A SUSPICIOUS PIECE OF LAW WAS PASSED AT A SUSPICIOUS TIME TO FREE SOME SUSPECTS
AfraRaymond_2012X@338.97:358.6 WE ARE DEALING WITH PERVERTS HERE OF AN ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL NATURE DO YOU GET HOW SERIOUS THIS PROBLEM IS THERE WAS MASSIVE PROTEST A LOT OF US IN THIS ROOM TOOK PART IN THE PROTEST IN DIFFERENT FORMS MOST IMPORTANTLY THE AMERICAN EMBASSY COMPLAINED SO PARLIAMENT WAS SWIFTLY RECONVENED AND THE LAW WAS REVERSED IT WAS REPEALED THAT 'S THE WORD LAWYERS USE IT WAS REPEALED
AfraRaymond_2012X@358.6:361.2 BUT THE POINT IS
AfraRaymond_2012X@368.03:372.93 BECAUSE OF THE SUSPICIOUS PASSAGE OF THAT LAW THE LAW WAS ACTUALLY PASSED INTO EFFECT
AfraRaymond_2012X@429.24:445.76 WE HAD A LOT OF BID RIGGING AND SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY CORRUPT ACTIVITY TOOK PLACE AND TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT IT CONSISTED OF AND TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT IN RELATIONSHIP TO THIS WHOLE SECOND MYTH ABOUT IT BEING NO BIG THING WE CAN LOOK AT THIS SECOND SLIDE HERE
AfraRaymond_2012X@445.76:454.71 AND WHAT WE HAVE HERE I AM NOT SAYING SO THIS IS THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS IN A WRITTEN STATEMENT HE SAID SO

AfraRaymond_2012X@750.63:763.44 THE CENTRAL BANK IN WHICH WE STAND THIS MORNING IS IMMUNE FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT SO IN FACT YOU CAN 'T ASK THEM ANYTHING AND THEY DON 'T HAVE TO ANSWER ANYTHING THAT IS THE LAW SINCE ONE THOUSAND NINE
AfraRaymond_2012X@777.14:782.82 I ASKED TO SEE THE ACCOUNTS OF CL FINANCIAL AND IF YOU CAN 'T SHOW ME THE ACCOUNTS
AfraRaymond_2012X@782.82:798.01 THE MINISTER OF FINANCE IS MAKING STATEMENTS PASSING NEW LAWS AND GIVING SPEECHES AND SO ON WHAT ARE THE FIGURES HE 'S RELYING ON IT 'S LIKE THAT JOKE I WANT WHATEVER HE 'S DRINKING AND THEY WROTE BACK AND SAID TO ME WELL WHAT DO YOU REALLY MEAN SO THEY HIT MY QUESTION WITH A QUESTION
AfraRaymond_2012X@798.01:799.69 SECOND POINT
AfraRaymond_2012X@868.14:875.15 USING THAT ACT OF PARLIAMENT FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT TO RELEASE THE INFORMATION AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS EXCELLENT
AfraRaymond_2012X@898.73:901.46 YOU SEE

AfraRaymond_2012X@915.11:934.12 FOR THE DIRECTORS OF CL FINANCIAL WHETHER IN FACT THEY WERE MAKING FILINGS UNDER OUR INTEGRITY IN PUBLIC LIFE ACT WE HAVE AN INTEGRITY IN PUBLIC LIFE ACT AS PART OF OUR FRAMEWORK SUPPOSED TO SAFEGUARD THE NATION 'S INTEREST AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS ARE SUPPOSED TO FILE TO SAY WHAT IT IS
AfraRaymond_2012X@934.12:946.2 THEY HAVE IN TERMS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND OF COURSE I 'VE SINCE DISCOVERED THAT THEY 'RE NOT FILING AND IN FACT THE MINISTER OF FINANCE HAS NOT EVEN ASKED THEM TO FILE SO HERE WE HAVE IT WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE
AfraRaymond_2012X@948.2:965.3 THE BASIC SAFEGUARDS OF INTEGRITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY HAVE ALL BEEN DISCARDED I 'VE ASKED THE QUESTION IN THE LEGAL AND REQUIRED FASHION IT 'S BEEN IGNORED THE SORT OF THING THAT MOTIVATED US AROUND SECTION THIRTY FOUR WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT WE CAN 'T FORGET IT
AfraRaymond_2012X@965.3:974.43 I HAVE DEFINED THIS AS THE SINGLE LARGEST EXPENDITURE IN THE COUNTRY 'S HISTORY IT 'S ALSO THE SINGLE LARGEST EXAMPLE OF PUBLIC CORRUPTION ACCORDING TO THIS EQUATION
AfraRaymond_2012X@977.34:981.92 AND THIS IS MY REALITY CHECK WHERE YOU HAVE AN EXPENDITURE OF PUBLIC MONEY
AfraRaymond_2012X@981.92:1001.3 AND IT IS WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND IT 'S WITHOUT TRANSPARENCY IT WILL ALWAYS BE EQUAL TO CORRUPTION WHETHER YOU 'RE IN RUSSIA OR NIGERIA OR ALASKA IT WILL ALWAYS BE EQUAL TO CORRUPTION AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH HERE I 'M GOING TO CONTINUE THE WORK TO PRESS ON TO GET
AfraRaymond_2012X@1001.3:1019.74 SOME RESOLUTION OF THOSE MATTERS AT THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE IF IT IS I HAVE TO GO TO COURT PERSONALLY I WILL DO THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS ON WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITHIN JCC BUT I WANT TO STEP BACK FROM THE TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO CONTEXT AND BRING SOMETHING NEW TO THE TABLE IN TERMS OF AN INTERNATIONAL EXAMPLE WE HAD THE JOURNALIST HEATHER BROOKE SPEAKING
AfraRaymond_2012X@1042.5:1056.67 WE CAN WORK ON IT TOGETHER WE NEED TO BUILD A COLLECTIVE DATABASE AND A COLLECTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE WE ARE TO GO TO THE NEXT POINT WE NEED TO INCREASE THE CONSCIOUSNESS THE FINAL THING I WANT TO SAY IS IN RELATION TO THIS ONE WHICH IS A LOVELY WEBSITE FROM INDIA
AfraRaymond_2012X@1072.69:1077.28 DISCARD THE SECOND MYTH IT IS A BIG THING IT 'S A HUGE PROBLEM IT 'S AN ECONOMIC CRIME
