GeoffMulgan_2011G@29.24:41.37 WHERE IT COMES FROM IS AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE YOUNG FOUNDATION WHICH OVER MANY DECADES HAS COME UP WITH MANY INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION LIKE THE OPEN UNIVERSITY AND THINGS LIKE EXTENDED SCHOOLS SCHOOLS FOR SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURS
GeoffMulgan_2011G@41.37:51.29 SUMMER UNIVERSITIES AND THE SCHOOL OF EVERYTHING AND ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WE ASKED WHAT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT NEED FOR INNOVATION IN SCHOOLING HERE IN THE U K
GeoffMulgan_2011G@51.29:56.18 AND WE FELT THE MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITY WAS TO BRING TOGETHER TWO SETS OF PROBLEMS ONE WAS
GeoffMulgan_2011G@56.18:75.18 LARGE NUMBERS OF BORED TEENAGERS WHO JUST DIDN 'T LIKE SCHOOL COULDN 'T SEE ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WHAT THEY LEARNED IN SCHOOL AND FUTURE JOBS AND EMPLOYERS WHO KEPT COMPLAINING THAT THE KIDS COMING OUT OF SCHOOL WEREN 'T ACTUALLY READY FOR REAL WORK DIDN 'T HAVE THE RIGHT ATTITUDES AND EXPERIENCE AND SO WE TRY TO ASK WHAT KIND OF SCHOOL WOULD HAVE THE TEENAGERS FIGHTING TO GET IN
GeoffMulgan_2011G@75.18:77.38 NOT FIGHTING TO STAY OUT
GeoffMulgan_2011G@77.38:85.48 AND AFTER HUNDREDS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH TEENAGERS AND TEACHERS AND PARENTS AND EMPLOYERS AND SCHOOLS FROM PARAGUAY TO AUSTRALIA
GeoffMulgan_2011G@85.48:103.92 AND LOOKING AT SOME OF THE ACADEMIC RESEARCH WHICH SHOWED THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT 'S NOW CALLED NON COGNITIVE SKILLS THE SKILLS OF MOTIVATION RESILIENCE AND THAT THESE ARE AS IMPORTANT AS THE COGNITIVE SKILLS FORMAL ACADEMIC SKILLS WE CAME UP WITH AN ANSWER A VERY SIMPLE ANSWER IN A WAY WHICH WE CALLED THE STUDIO SCHOOL
GeoffMulgan_2011G@103.92:122.54 AND WE CALLED IT A STUDIO SCHOOL TO GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL IDEA OF A STUDIO IN THE RENAISSANCE WHERE WORK AND LEARNING ARE INTEGRATED YOU WORK BY LEARNING AND YOU LEARN BY WORKING AND THE DESIGN WE CAME UP WITH HAD THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS FIRST OF ALL WE WANTED SMALL SCHOOLS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED PUPILS
GeoffMulgan_2011G@122.54:135.73 FOURTEEN TO NINETEEN YEAR OLDS AND CRITICALLY ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE CURRICULUM DONE NOT THROUGH SITTING IN CLASSROOMS BUT THROUGH REAL LIFE PRACTICAL PROJECTS WORKING ON COMMISSION TO BUSINESSES NGO 'S AND OTHERS
GeoffMulgan_2011G@135.73:148.86 THAT EVERY PUPIL WOULD HAVE A COACH AS WELL AS TEACHERS WHO WOULD HAVE TIMETABLES MUCH MORE LIKE A WORK ENVIRONMENT IN A BUSINESS AND ALL OF THIS WILL BE DONE WITHIN THE PUBLIC SYSTEM FUNDED BY PUBLIC MONEY BUT INDEPENDENTLY RUN
GeoffMulgan_2011G@148.86:159.65 AND ALL AT NO EXTRA COST NO SELECTION AND ALLOWING THE PUPILS THE ROUTE INTO UNIVERSITY EVEN IF MANY OF THEM WOULD WANT TO BECOME ENTREPRENEURS AND HAVE MANUAL JOBS AS WELL
GeoffMulgan_2011G@159.65:174.57 UNDERLYING IT WAS SOME VERY SIMPLE IDEAS THAT LARGE NUMBERS OF TEENAGERS LEARN BEST BY DOING THINGS THEY LEARN BEST IN TEAMS AND THEY LEARN BEST BY DOING THINGS FOR REAL ALL THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT MAINSTREAM SCHOOLING ACTUALLY DOES
GeoffMulgan_2011G@174.57:179.67 NOW THAT WAS A NICE IDEA SO WE MOVED INTO THE RAPID PROTOTYPING PHASE
GeoffMulgan_2011G@179.67:199.2 WE TRIED IT OUT FIRST IN LUTON FAMOUS FOR ITS AIRPORT AND NOT MUCH ELSE I FEAR AND IN BLACKPOOL FAMOUS FOR ITS BEACHES AND LEISURE AND WHAT WE FOUND AND WE GOT QUITE A LOT OF THINGS WRONG AND THEN IMPROVED THEM BUT WE FOUND THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE LOVED IT THEY FOUND IT MUCH MORE MOTIVATIONAL MUCH MORE EXCITING THAN TRADITIONAL EDUCATION
GeoffMulgan_2011G@199.2:218.59 AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL TWO YEARS LATER WHEN THE EXAM RESULTS CAME THROUGH THE PUPILS WHO HAD BEEN PUT ON THESE FIELD TRIALS WHO WERE IN THE LOWEST PERFORMING GROUPS HAD JUMPED RIGHT TO THE TOP IN FACT PRETTY MUCH AT THE TOP DECILE OF PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF GCSE 'S WHICH IS THE BRITISH MARKING SYSTEM
GeoffMulgan_2011G@218.59:223.59 NOW NOT SURPRISINGLY THAT INFLUENCED SOME PEOPLE TO THINK WE WERE ONTO SOMETHING
GeoffMulgan_2011G@223.59:241.54 THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION DOWN SOUTH IN LONDON DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS A BIG FAN AND THE BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS THOUGHT WE WERE ONTO SOMETHING IN TERMS OF A WAY OF PREPARING CHILDREN MUCH BETTER FOR REAL LIFE WORK TODAY AND INDEED THE HEAD OF THE CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE IS NOW THE CHAIRMAN OF THE STUDIO SCHOOLS TRUST
GeoffMulgan_2011G@241.54:246.92 AND HELPING IT NOT JUST WITH BIG BUSINESSES BUT SMALL BUSINESSES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
GeoffMulgan_2011G@246.92:264.71 WE STARTED WITH TWO SCHOOLS THAT 'S GROWN THIS YEAR TO ABOUT TEN AND NEXT YEAR WE 'RE EXPECTING ABOUT THIRTY FIVE SCHOOLS OPEN ACROSS ENGLAND AND ANOTHER FORTY AREAS WANT TO HAVE THEIR OWN SCHOOLS OPENING A PRETTY RAPID SPREAD OF THIS IDEA
GeoffMulgan_2011G@264.71:269.89 INTERESTINGLY IT 'S HAPPENED ALMOST ENTIRELY WITHOUT MEDIA COVERAGE
GeoffMulgan_2011G@269.89:281.47 IT 'S HAPPENED ALMOST ENTIRELY WITHOUT BIG MONEY BEHIND IT IT SPREAD ALMOST ENTIRELY THROUGH WORD OF MOUTH VIRALLY ACROSS TEACHERS PARENTS PEOPLE INVOLVED IN EDUCATION
GeoffMulgan_2011G@281.47:299.4 AND IT SPREAD BECAUSE OF THE POWER OF AN IDEA SO THE VERY VERY SIMPLE IDEA ABOUT TURNING EDUCATION ON ITS HEAD AND PUTTING THE THINGS WHICH WERE MARGINAL THINGS LIKE WORKING IN TEAMS DOING PRACTICAL PROJECTS AND PUTTING THEM RIGHT AT THE HEART OF LEARNING RATHER THAN ON THE EDGES
GeoffMulgan_2011G@299.4:318.57 NOW THERE 'S A WHOLE SET OF NEW SCHOOLS OPENING UP THIS AUTUMN THIS IS ONE FROM YORKSHIRE WHERE IN FACT MY NEPHEW I HOPE WILL BE ABLE TO ATTEND IT AND THIS ONE IS FOCUSED ON CREATIVE AND MEDIA INDUSTRIES OTHER ONES HAVE A FOCUS ON HEALTH CARE TOURISM ENGINEERING AND OTHER FIELDS
GeoffMulgan_2011G@318.57:330.49 WE THINK WE 'RE ONTO SOMETHING IT 'S NOT PERFECT YET BUT WE THINK THIS IS ONE IDEA WHICH CAN TRANSFORM THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS POSSIBLY MILLIONS OF TEENAGERS WHO ARE REALLY BORED BY SCHOOLING
GeoffMulgan_2011G@330.49:344.2 IT DOESN 'T ANIMATE THEM THEY 'RE NOT LIKE ALL OF YOU WHO CAN SIT IN ROWS AND HEAR THINGS SAID TO YOU FOR HOUR AFTER HOUR THEY WANT TO DO THINGS THEY WANT TO GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY THEY WANT EDUCATION TO BE FOR REAL
GeoffMulgan_2011G@344.2:354.06 AND MY HOPE IS THAT SOME OF YOU OUT THERE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP US WE FEEL WE 'RE ON THE BEGINNING OF A JOURNEY OF EXPERIMENT AND IMPROVEMENT
