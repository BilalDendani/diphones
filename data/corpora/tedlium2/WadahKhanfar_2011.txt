WadahKhanfar_2011 EXACTLY I WAS IN AFGHANISTAN
WadahKhanfar_2011 THESE REGIMES CREATED SOMETHING WITHIN US
WadahKhanfar_2011 DURING THIS PERIOD I 'M FORTY THREE YEARS OLD RIGHT NOW FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS I HAVE SEEN ALMOST THE SAME FACES FOR KINGS AND PRESIDENTS RULING US
WadahKhanfar_2011 AGED AUTHORITARIAN CORRUPT
WadahKhanfar_2011 YES THEY GOT RID OF SADDAM HUSSEIN BUT WHEN THEY SAW THEIR LAND OCCUPIED BY FOREIGN FORCES THEY FELT VERY SAD THEY FELT THAT THEIR DIGNITY HAD SUFFERED AND THIS IS WHY THEY REVOLTED THIS IS WHY THEY DID NOT ACCEPT
WadahKhanfar_2011 WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE CIVIL WAR SECTARIAN KILLING WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE DESTRUCTION WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE FOREIGN TROOPS ON YOUR LAND
WadahKhanfar_2011 THAT WAS ONE OF THE WORST NIGHTMARES THAT WE HAVE SEEN FOR TEN YEARS
WadahKhanfar_2011 IMAGES OF DESTRUCTION IMAGES OF KILLING OF SECTARIAN CONFLICTS IMAGES OF VIOLENCE EMERGING FROM A MAGNIFICENT PIECE OF LAND A REGION THAT ONE DAY WAS THE SOURCE OF CIVILIZATIONS AND ART AND CULTURE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS
WadahKhanfar_2011 NOW I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE FUTURE THAT WE WERE DREAMING FOR HAS EVENTUALLY ARRIVED
WadahKhanfar_2011 INSPIRED BY UNIVERSAL VALUES
WadahKhanfar_2011 AND A GLOBAL UNDERSTANDING

WadahKhanfar_2011 BUT YES
WadahKhanfar_2011 WHO HAVE BEEN INSPIRED BY UNIVERSAL VALUES
WadahKhanfar_2011 WHO ARE IDEALISTIC ENOUGH TO IMAGINE A MAGNIFICENT FUTURE AND AT THE SAME TIME REALISTIC ENOUGH TO BALANCE THIS KIND OF IMAGINATION AND THE PROCESS LEADING TO IT NOT USING VIOLENCE NOT TRYING TO CREATE CHAOS
WadahKhanfar_2011 WE PUT IT IN EVERY SITTING ROOM IN THE ARAB WORLD AND INTERNATIONALLY GLOBALLY
WadahKhanfar_2011 AND WHILE THIS WAS THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MANY INITIATIVES BEFORE TO CREATE CHANGE
WadahKhanfar_2011 CULTURE CULTURAL DIVERSITY WITH OUR FAITH IN OUR TRADITION AND IN OUR HISTORY BUT AT THE SAME TIME OPEN TO UNIVERSAL VALUES CONNECTED WITH THE WORLD TOLERANT TO THE OUTSIDE AND THIS IS
WadahKhanfar_2011 WE ARE SEEING THEM COLLAPSING ONE AFTER THE OTHER
WadahKhanfar_2011 A TOOL OF REVOLUTION WE DO NOT CREATE REVOLUTIONS HOWEVER WHEN SOMETHING OF THAT MAGNITUDE HAPPENS WE ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COVERAGE
WadahKhanfar_2011 BUT MOST OF
WadahKhanfar_2011 TO PHONE OUR CORRESPONDENTS THERE AND TO PHONE OUR NEWSROOM AND TO TELL THEM MAKE YOUR BEST NOT TO SWITCH OFF THE CAMERAS AT NIGHT BECAUSE THE GUYS THERE REALLY FEEL CONFIDENT WHEN SOMEONE IS REPORTING THEIR STORY AND THEY FEEL PROTECTED AS WELL
WadahKhanfar_2011 SO WE HAVE A CHANCE
WadahKhanfar_2011 TO CREATE A NEW FUTURE IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD WE HAVE A CHANCE TO
WadahKhanfar_2011 CANNOT CREATE BUT TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION
WadahKhanfar_2011 LET US ACCEPT THE CHOICE OF THE PEOPLE LET US NOT PICK AND CHOOSE WHO WE WOULD LIKE TO RULE THEIR FUTURE THE FUTURE SHOULD BE RULED BY PEOPLE THEMSELVES EVEN SOMETIMES IF THEY ARE VOICES THAT MIGHT NOW SCARE US BUT
