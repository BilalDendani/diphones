SebastianSeung_2010G LIVE IN IN A REMARKABLE TIME THE AGE OF GENOMICS YOUR GENOME IS THE ENTIRE SEQUENCE OF YOUR DNA YOUR SEQUENCE AND MINE ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
SebastianSeung_2010G THAT'S WHY WE LOOK DIFFERENT I'VE GOT BROWN EYES YOU MIGHT HAVE BLUE OR GRAY BUT IT'S NOT JUST SKIN DEEP THE HEADLINES TELL US THAT GENES CAN GIVE US SCARY DISEASES
SebastianSeung_2010G MAYBE EVEN SHAPE OUR PERSONALITY OR GIVE US MENTAL DISORDERS OUR GENES SEEM TO HAVE
SebastianSeung_2010G AWESOME POWER OVER OUR
SebastianSeung_2010G AND YET I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT I AM MORE THAN MY GENES
SebastianSeung_2010G ARE YOU MORE THAN YOUR GENES YES
SebastianSeung_2010G MORE THAN MY
SebastianSeung_2010G I I AM MY CONNECTOME
SebastianSeung_2010G SINCE YOU GUYS ARE REALLY GREAT MAYBE YOU CAN HUMOR ME AND SAY THIS ALL TOGETHER
SebastianSeung_2010G RIGHT ALL TOGETHER NOW EVERYBODY I AM
SebastianSeung_2010G GREAT YOU KNOW YOU GUYS ARE SO GREAT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A CONNECTOME IS AND YOU'RE WILLING TO PLAY ALONG WITH ME I COULD JUST GO HOME NOW WELL SO FAR
SebastianSeung_2010G ONLY ONE CONNECTOME IS KNOWN THAT OF THIS TINY WORM ITS MODEST NERVOUS SYSTEM CONSISTS OF JUST THREE HUNDRED NEURONS
SebastianSeung_2010G AND IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES A TEAM OF SCIENTISTS MAPPED ALL SEVEN THOUSAND CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE NEURONS
SebastianSeung_2010G IN THIS DIAGRAM EVERY NODE IS A NEURON AND EVERY LINE IS A CONNECTION THIS IS THE CONNECTOME OF THE WORM C ELEGANS
SebastianSeung_2010G YOUR CONNECTOME IS FAR MORE COMPLEX THAN THIS BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN CONTAINS ONE HUNDRED BILLION NEURONS AND TEN THOUSAND TIMES AS MANY CONNECTIONS
SebastianSeung_2010G YOUR GENOME HAS LETTERS THAT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION WHAT'S IN THAT INFORMATION
SebastianSeung_2010G WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT THERE ARE THEORIES SINCE THE NINETEENTH CENTURY NEUROSCIENTISTS HAVE SPECULATED
SebastianSeung_2010G THAT MAYBE YOUR MEMORIES THE INFORMATION THAT MAKES YOU YOU MAYBE YOUR MEMORIES ARE STORED IN THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN YOUR BRAIN 'S NEURONS
SebastianSeung_2010G AND PERHAPS OTHER ASPECTS OF YOUR PERSONAL IDENTITY MAYBE YOUR PERSONALITY AND YOUR INTELLECT MAYBE THEY'RE ALSO ENCODED
SebastianSeung_2010G IN THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN YOUR NEURONS AND SO NOW YOU CAN SEE WHY I PROPOSED THIS HYPOTHESIS I AM MY CONNECTOME
SebastianSeung_2010G WE NEED MORE SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE AUTOMATED THAT WILL SPEED UP THE PROCESS OF FINDING CONNECTOMES
SebastianSeung_2010G NOW YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN PICTURES OF NEURONS BEFORE YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THEM INSTANTLY BY THEIR FANTASTIC SHAPES THEY EXTEND LONG AND DELICATE BRANCHES AND IN SHORT THEY LOOK LIKE TREES
SebastianSeung_2010G BUT THIS IS JUST A SINGLE NEURON IN ORDER TO FIND CONNECTOMES WE HAVE TO SEE ALL THE NEURONS AT THE SAME TIME
SebastianSeung_2010G SO LET 'S MEET BOBBY KASTHURI WHO WORKS IN THE LABORATORY OF JEFF LICHTMAN AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY BOBBY IS HOLDING FANTASTICALLY THIN SLICES OF A MOUSE BRAIN
SebastianSeung_2010G AND WE'RE ZOOMING IN BY A FACTOR OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES TO OBTAIN THE RESOLUTION SO THAT WE CAN SEE THE BRANCHES OF NEURONS ALL AT THE SAME TIME
SebastianSeung_2010G EXCEPT YOU STILL MAY NOT REALLY RECOGNIZE THEM AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE TO WORK IN THREE DIMENSIONS IF WE TAKE MANY IMAGES OF MANY SLICES OF THE BRAIN
SebastianSeung_2010G AND STACK THEM UP WE GET A THREE DIMENSIONAL IMAGE AND STILL YOU MAY NOT SEE THE BRANCHES SO WE START AT THE TOP AND WE COLOR IN THE CROSS SECTION OF ONE BRANCH IN RED
SebastianSeung_2010G AND WE DO THAT FOR THE NEXT SLICE AND FOR THE NEXT SLICE AND WE KEEP ON DOING THAT SLICE AFTER SLICE
SebastianSeung_2010G IF WE CONTINUE THROUGH THE ENTIRE STACK WE CAN RECONSTRUCT THE THREE DIMENSIONAL SHAPE OF A SMALL FRAGMENT OF A BRANCH OF A NEURON
SebastianSeung_2010G LET 'S ZOOM IN ON ONE SYNAPSE AND KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE INTERIOR OF THE GREEN NEURON YOU SHOULD SEE SMALL CIRCLES THESE ARE CALLED VESICLES
SebastianSeung_2010G THEY CONTAIN A MOLECULE KNOW AS A NEUROTRANSMITTER AND SO WHEN THE GREEN NEURON WANTS TO COMMUNICATE IT WANTS TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE RED NEURON
SebastianSeung_2010G IT SPITS OUT NEUROTRANSMITTER AT THE SYNAPSE THE TWO NEURONS ARE SAID TO BE CONNECTED LIKE TWO FRIENDS TALKING ON THE TELEPHONE
SebastianSeung_2010G SO YOU SEE HOW TO FIND A SYNAPSE HOW CAN WE FIND AN ENTIRE CONNECTOME WELL WE TAKE
SebastianSeung_2010G THIS THREE DIMENSIONAL STACK OF IMAGES AND TREAT IT AS A GIGANTIC THREE DIMENSIONAL COLORING BOOK WE COLOR EVERY NEURON IN IN A DIFFERENT COLOR
SebastianSeung_2010G AND THEN WE LOOK THROUGH ALL OF THE IMAGES FIND THE SYNAPSES AND NOTE THE COLORS OF THE TWO NEURONS INVOLVED IN EACH SYNAPSE IF WE CAN DO THAT THROUGHOUT ALL THE IMAGES WE COULD FIND A CONNECTOME
SebastianSeung_2010G NOW AT THIS POINT YOU'VE LEARNED THE BASICS OF NEURONS AND SYNAPSES AND SO I THINK WE'RE READY TO TACKLE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS IN NEUROSCIENCE HOW ARE THE BRAINS OF MEN AND WOMEN DIFFERENT
SebastianSeung_2010G GUYS BRAINS ARE LIKE WAFFLES THEY KEEP THEIR LIVES COMPARTMENTALIZED IN BOXES GIRLS BRAINS ARE LIKE SPAGHETTI EVERYTHING IN THEIR LIFE IS CONNECTED TO EVERYTHING ELSE YOU GUYS ARE LAUGHING BUT YOU KNOW
SebastianSeung_2010G THIS BOOK CHANGED MY LIFE
SebastianSeung_2010G IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU'RE A GUY OR
SebastianSeung_2010G EVERYONE 'S BRAINS ARE LIKE SPAGHETTI OR MAYBE REALLY REALLY FINE CAPELLINI WITH BRANCHES
SebastianSeung_2010G JUST AS ONE STRAND OF SPAGHETTI CONTACTS MANY OTHER STRANDS ON YOUR PLATE ONE NEURON TOUCHES MANY OTHER NEURONS THROUGH THEIR ENTANGLED BRANCHES
SebastianSeung_2010G ONE NEURON CAN BE CONNECTED TO SO MANY OTHER NEURONS BECAUSE THERE CAN BE SYNAPSES AT THESE POINTS OF CONTACT
SebastianSeung_2010G BY NOW YOU MIGHT HAVE SORT OF LOST PERSPECTIVE ON HOW LARGE THIS CUBE OF BRAIN TISSUE ACTUALLY IS AND SO LET 'S DO A SERIES OF COMPARISONS TO SHOW YOU I ASSURE YOU THIS IS VERY TINY IT'S JUST SIX MICRONS ON A SIDE
SebastianSeung_2010G SO HERE 'S HOW IT STACKS UP AGAINST AN ENTIRE NEURON AND YOU CAN TELL THAT REALLY ONLY THE SMALLEST FRAGMENTS OF BRANCHES ARE CONTAINED INSIDE THIS CUBE
SebastianSeung_2010G AND A NEURON WELL THAT'S SMALLER THAN BRAIN AND THAT'S JUST A MOUSE BRAIN
SebastianSeung_2010G IS HOPELESS BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT A BRAIN WITH YOUR NAKED EYE YOU DON'T REALLY SEE HOW COMPLEX IT IS BUT WHEN YOU USE A MICROSCOPE FINALLY THE HIDDEN COMPLEXITY IS REVEALED
SebastianSeung_2010G IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THE MATHEMATICIAN AND PHILOSOPHER BLAISE PASCAL WROTE OF HIS DREAD OF THE INFINITE HIS FEELING OF INSIGNIFICANCE AT CONTEMPLATING
SebastianSeung_2010G THE VAST REACHES OF OUTER SPACE AND AS A SCIENTIST I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT MY FEELINGS TOO MUCH INFORMATION PROFESSOR
SebastianSeung_2010G BUT MAY I
SebastianSeung_2010G I FEEL CURIOSITY AND I FEEL WONDER BUT AT TIMES I HAVE ALSO FELT DESPAIR
SebastianSeung_2010G WHY DID I CHOOSE TO STUDY THIS ORGAN THAT IS SO AWESOME IN ITS COMPLEXITY THAT IT MIGHT WELL BE INFINITE
SebastianSeung_2010G IT'S ABSURD HOW COULD WE EVEN DARE TO THINK THAT WE MIGHT
SebastianSeung_2010G AND YET I PERSIST IN THIS QUIXOTIC ENDEAVOR AND INDEED THESE DAYS I HARBOR NEW HOPES SOME DAY
SebastianSeung_2010G AN ENTIRE HUMAN CONNECTOME IS ONE OF THE GREATEST TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES OF ALL TIME IT WILL TAKE THE WORK OF GENERATIONS TO SUCCEED
SebastianSeung_2010G AT THE PRESENT TIME MY COLLABORATORS AND I WHAT WE'RE AIMING FOR IS MUCH MORE MODEST JUST TO FIND PARTIAL CONNECTOMES OF TINY CHUNKS
SebastianSeung_2010G MOUSE AND HUMAN BRAIN BUT EVEN THAT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR THE FIRST TESTS OF THIS HYPOTHESIS THAT I AM MY CONNECTOME
SebastianSeung_2010G FOR NOW LET ME TRY TO CONVINCE YOU OF THE PLAUSIBILITY OF THIS HYPOTHESIS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY WORTH TAKING SERIOUSLY
SebastianSeung_2010G AS YOU GROW DURING CHILDHOOD AND AGE DURING ADULTHOOD YOUR PERSONAL IDENTITY CHANGES SLOWLY
SebastianSeung_2010G LIKEWISE EVERY CONNECTOME CHANGES OVER TIME WHAT KINDS OF CHANGES HAPPEN WELL NEURONS LIKE TREES CAN GROW NEW BRANCHES AND THEY CAN LOSE OLD ONES
SebastianSeung_2010G SYNAPSES CAN BE CREATED AND THEY CAN BE ELIMINATED AND SYNAPSES CAN GROW LARGER
SebastianSeung_2010G IT'S TRUE TO SOME EXTENT THEY ARE PROGRAMMED BY YOUR GENES BUT THAT'S NOT THE WHOLE STORY
SebastianSeung_2010G BECAUSE THERE ARE SIGNALS ELECTRICAL SIGNALS THAT TRAVEL ALONG THE BRANCHES OF NEURONS AND CHEMICAL SIGNALS THAT JUMP ACROSS FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH THESE SIGNALS ARE CALLED NEURAL ACTIVITY
SebastianSeung_2010G AND THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT NEURAL ACTIVITY CAN CAUSE YOUR CONNECTIONS TO CHANGE AND IF YOU PUT THOSE TWO FACTS TOGETHER IT MEANS THAT YOUR EXPERIENCES CAN CHANGE YOUR CONNECTOME
SebastianSeung_2010G AND IT MIGHT TRUE THAT JUST THE MERE ACT OF THINKING CAN CHANGE YOUR CONNECTOME AN IDEA THAT YOU MAY FIND EMPOWERING
SebastianSeung_2010G A COOL AND REFRESHING STREAM OF WATER YOU SAY WHAT ELSE IS IN THIS PICTURE
SebastianSeung_2010G DO NOT FORGET THAT GROOVE IN THE EARTH CALLED THE STREAM BED WITHOUT IT THE WATER WOULD NOT KNOW IN WHICH DIRECTION TO FLOW
SebastianSeung_2010G AND WITH THE STREAM I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE A METAPHOR FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NEURAL ACTIVITY AND CONNECTIVITY
SebastianSeung_2010G THE PATHWAYS ALONG WHICH NEURAL ACTIVITY FLOWS AND SO THE CONNECTOME IS LIKE BED OF THE STREAM
SebastianSeung_2010G BUT THE METAPHOR IS RICHER THAN THAT BECAUSE IT'S TRUE THAT THE STREAM BED GUIDES THE FLOW OF THE WATER
SebastianSeung_2010G BUT OVER LONG TIMESCALES THE WATER ALSO RESHAPES THE BED OF THE STREAM AND AS I TOLD YOU JUST NOW
SebastianSeung_2010G NEURAL ACTIVITY CAN CHANGE THE CONNECTOME AND IF YOU'LL ALLOW ME TO ASCEND TO METAPHORICAL HEIGHTS
SebastianSeung_2010G I WILL REMIND YOU THAT NEURAL ACTIVITY IS THE PHYSICAL BASIS OR SO NEUROSCIENTISTS THINK OF THOUGHTS FEELINGS AND PERCEPTIONS AND SO WE MIGHT EVEN SPEAK OF THE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS NEURAL ACTIVITY IS ITS WATER
SebastianSeung_2010G SO LET 'S RETURN FROM THE HEIGHTS OF METAPHOR AND RETURN TO SCIENCE SUPPOSE OUR TECHNOLOGIES FOR FINDING CONNECTOMES ACTUALLY WORK HOW WILL WE GO ABOUT TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS I AM MY
SebastianSeung_2010G CONNECTOME WELL I PROPOSE A DIRECT TEST LET US ATTEMPT TO READ OUT MEMORIES FROM CONNECTOMES
SebastianSeung_2010G THE MEMORY OF LONG TEMPORAL SEQUENCES OF MOVEMENTS LIKE A PIANIST PLAYING A BEETHOVEN SONATA
SebastianSeung_2010G BECAUSE IF THE FIRST NEURONS IN THE CHAIN ARE ACTIVATED THROUGH THEIR SYNAPSES THEY SEND MESSAGES TO THE SECOND NEURONS WHICH ARE ACTIVATED AND SO ON DOWN THE LINE
SebastianSeung_2010G LIKE A CHAIN OF FALLING DOMINOES AND THIS SEQUENCE OF NEURAL ACTIVATION IS HYPOTHESIZED TO BE THE NEURAL BASIS OF THOSE SEQUENCE OF MOVEMENTS
SebastianSeung_2010G SO ONE WAY OF TRYING TO TEST THE THEORY IS TO LOOK FOR SUCH CHAINS INSIDE CONNECTOMES BUT IT WON 'T BE EASY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LOOK LIKE THIS THEY'RE GOING TO BE SCRAMBLED
SebastianSeung_2010G SO WE'LL HAVE TO USE OUR COMPUTERS TO TRY TO UNSCRAMBLE THE CHAIN AND IF WE CAN DO THAT THE SEQUENCE OF THE NEURONS WE RECOVER
SebastianSeung_2010G FROM THAT UNSCRAMBLING WILL BE A PREDICTION OF THE PATTERN OF NEURAL ACTIVITY THAT IS REPLAYED IN THE BRAIN DURING MEMORY RECALL AND IF THAT WERE SUCCESSFUL THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF READING A MEMORY FROM A CONNECTOME
SebastianSeung_2010G WHAT A MESS
SebastianSeung_2010G HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO WIRE UP A SYSTEM AS COMPLEX AS THIS I HOPE NOT BUT IF YOU HAVE YOU KNOW IT'S VERY EASY TO MAKE A MISTAKE
SebastianSeung_2010G THE BRANCHES OF NEURONS ARE LIKE THE WIRES OF THE BRAIN CAN ANYONE GUESS WHAT'S THE TOTAL LENGTH OF WIRES IN YOUR BRAIN
SebastianSeung_2010G I ESTIMATE MILLIONS OF
SebastianSeung_2010G ALL PACKED IN YOUR SKULL AND IF YOU APPRECIATE THAT NUMBER YOU CAN EASILY SEE THERE IS HUGE POTENTIAL FOR MIS WIRING OF THE BRAIN
SebastianSeung_2010G AND INDEED THE POPULAR PRESS LOVES HEADLINES LIKE ANOREXIC BRAINS ARE WIRED DIFFERENTLY OR AUTISTIC BRAINS ARE WIRED DIFFERENTLY
SebastianSeung_2010G THESE ARE PLAUSIBLE CLAIMS BUT IN TRUTH WE CAN'T SEE THE BRAIN 'S WIRING CLEARLY ENOUGH TO TELL IF THESE ARE REALLY TRUE AND SO THE TECHNOLOGIES FOR SEEING CONNECTOMES WILL ALLOW US TO FINALLY READ
SebastianSeung_2010G MIS WIRING OF THE BRAIN TO SEE MENTAL DISORDERS IN CONNECTOMES SOMETIMES
SebastianSeung_2010G THE BEST WAY TO TEST A HYPOTHESIS IS TO CONSIDER ITS MOST EXTREME IMPLICATION PHILOSOPHERS KNOW THIS GAME VERY WELL
SebastianSeung_2010G IF YOU BELIEVE THAT I AM MY CONNECTOME I THINK YOU MUST ALSO ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT DEATH IS THE DESTRUCTION OF YOUR CONNECTOME
SebastianSeung_2010G I MENTION THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE PROPHETS TODAY WHO CLAIM THAT TECHNOLOGY WILL FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE HUMAN CONDITION AND PERHAPS EVEN TRANSFORM THE HUMAN SPECIES
SebastianSeung_2010G ONE OF THEIR MOST CHERISHED DREAMS IS TO CHEAT DEATH BY THAT PRACTICE KNOWN AS CRYONICS IF YOU PAY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU CAN ARRANGE TO HAVE YOUR BODY FROZEN AFTER DEATH AND STORED IN LIQUID NITROGEN
SebastianSeung_2010G IN ONE OF THESE TANKS IN AN ARIZONA WAREHOUSE AWAITING A FUTURE CIVILIZATION THAT IS ADVANCED TO RESURRECT YOU SHOULD WE RIDICULE THE MODERN SEEKERS OF IMMORTALITY CALLING THEM FOOLS OR WILL THEY SOME DAY CHUCKLE
SebastianSeung_2010G OVER OUR GRAVES I DON'T KNOW I PREFER TO TEST THEIR BELIEFS SCIENTIFICALLY I PROPOSE THAT WE ATTEMPT TO FIND A CONNECTOME OF A FROZEN BRAIN
SebastianSeung_2010G THE BODY BUT NOT FOR THE MIND ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE CONNECTOME IS STILL INTACT WE CANNOT RIDICULE THE CLAIMS OF CRYONICS SO
SebastianSeung_2010G AS WE EVOLVED FROM OUR APE LIKE ANCESTORS ON THE AFRICAN SAVANNA WHAT DISTINGUISHED US WAS OUR LARGER BRAINS WE HAVE USED OUR BRAINS TO FASHION EVER MORE AMAZING TECHNOLOGIES
SebastianSeung_2010G I BELIEVE THAT THIS VOYAGE OF SELF DISCOVERY IS NOT JUST FOR SCIENTISTS BUT FOR ALL OF US AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THIS VOYAGE WITH YOU TODAY THANK YOU
