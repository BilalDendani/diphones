MarkhamNolan_2012S@35.43:51.74 SO IT 'S A REALLY INTERESTING TIME TO BE A JOURNALIST BUT THE UPHEAVAL THAT I 'M INTERESTED IN IS NOT ON THE OUTPUT SIDE IT 'S ON THE INPUT SIDE IT 'S CONCERN WITH HOW WE GET INFORMATION AND HOW WE GATHER THE NEWS AND THAT 'S CHANGED BECAUSE WE 'VE HAD A HUGE SHIFT IN THE BALANCE OF POWER FROM
MarkhamNolan_2012S@51.74:69.55 THE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS TO THE AUDIENCE AND THE AUDIENCE FOR SUCH A LONG TIME WAS IN A POSITION WHERE THEY DIDN 'T HAVE ANY WAY OF AFFECTING NEWS OR MAKING ANY CHANGE THEY COULDN 'T REALLY CONNECT AND THAT 'S CHANGED IRREVOCABLY MY FIRST CONNECTION WITH THE NEWS MEDIA WAS IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR THE BBC HAD A ONE DAY STRIKE
MarkhamNolan_2012S@69.55:80.87 I WASN 'T HAPPY I WAS ANGRY I COULDN 'T SEE MY CARTOONS SO I WROTE A LETTER AND IT 'S A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY OF ENDING YOUR HATE MAIL LOVE MARKHAM AGED FOUR STILL WORKS
MarkhamNolan_2012S@81.68:100.71 I 'M NOT SURE IF I HAD ANY IMPACT ON THE ONE DAY STRIKE BUT WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT IT TOOK THEM THREE WEEKS TO GET BACK TO ME AND THAT WAS THE ROUND JOURNEY IT TOOK THAT LONG FOR ANYONE TO HAVE ANY IMPACT AND GET SOME FEEDBACK AND THAT 'S CHANGED NOW BECAUSE AS JOURNALISTS WE INTERACT IN REAL TIME WE 'RE NOT IN A POSITION WHERE THE AUDIENCE IS REACTING TO NEWS WE 'RE REACTING TO THE AUDIENCE
MarkhamNolan_2012S@100.71:111.22 AND WE 'RE ACTUALLY RELYING ON THEM THEY 'RE HELPING US FIND THE NEWS THEY 'RE HELPING US FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE BEST ANGLE TO TAKE AND WHAT IS THE STUFF THAT THEY WANT TO HEAR SO
MarkhamNolan_2012S@115.48:120.02 A CONSTANT BASIS AND THE JOURNALIST IS ALWAYS PLAYING CATCH UP
MarkhamNolan_2012S@120.02:138.82 TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE RELY ON THE AUDIENCE ON THE FIFTH OF SEPTEMBER IN COSTA RICA AN EARTHQUAKE HIT IT WAS A SEVEN POINT SIX MAGNITUDE IT WAS FAIRLY BIG AND SIXTY SECONDS IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TOOK FOR IT TO TRAVEL TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY KILOMETERS TO MANAGUA SO THE GROUND SHOOK IN MANAGUA SIXTY SECONDS AFTER IT HIT THE EPICENTER
MarkhamNolan_2012S@138.82:154.95 THIRTY SECONDS LATER THE FIRST MESSAGE WENT ONTO TWITTER AND THIS WAS SOMEONE SAYING TEMBLOR WHICH MEANS EARTHQUAKE SO SIXTY SECONDS WAS HOW LONG IT TOOK FOR THE PHYSICAL EARTHQUAKE TO TRAVEL THIRTY SECONDS LATER NEWS OF THAT EARTHQUAKE HAD TRAVELED ALL AROUND THE WORLD INSTANTLY EVERYONE IN THE WORLD
MarkhamNolan_2012S@154.99:159.75 HYPOTHETICALLY HAD THE POTENTIAL TO KNOW THAT AN EARTHQUAKE WAS HAPPENING IN MANAGUA
MarkhamNolan_2012S@159.75:175.13 AND THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE THIS ONE PERSON HAD A DOCUMENTARY INSTINCT WHICH WAS TO POST A STATUS UPDATE WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL DO NOW SO IF SOMETHING HAPPENS WE PUT OUR STATUS UPDATE OR WE POST A PHOTO WE POST A VIDEO AND IT ALL GOES UP INTO THE CLOUD IN A CONSTANT STREAM AND
MarkhamNolan_2012S@175.13:183.28 WHAT THAT MEANS IS JUST CONSTANT HUGE VOLUMES OF DATA GOING UP IT 'S ACTUALLY STAGGERING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS EVERY MINUTE
MarkhamNolan_2012S@183.28:194.2 THERE ARE SEVENTY TWO MORE HOURS OF VIDEO ON YOUTUBE SO THAT 'S EVERY SECOND MORE THAN AN HOUR OF VIDEO GETS UPLOADED AND IN PHOTOS INSTAGRAM FIFTY EIGHT PHOTOS ARE UPLOADED TO INSTAGRAM A SECOND
MarkhamNolan_2012S@194.2:205.05 MORE THAN THREE AND A HALF THOUSAND PHOTOS GO UP ONTO FACEBOOK SO BY THE TIME I 'M FINISHED TALKING HERE THERE 'LL BE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR MORE HOURS OF VIDEO ON YOUTUBE THAN THERE WERE WHEN I STARTED
MarkhamNolan_2012S@205.05:209.13 AND TWO AND A HALF MILLION MORE PHOTOS ON FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM THAN WHEN I STARTED
MarkhamNolan_2012S@229.77:243.33 AND THAT CAN BE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT WHEN YOU 'RE DEALING WITH THOSE VOLUMES AND NOWHERE WAS THIS BROUGHT HOME MORE THAN DURING HURRICANE SANDY SO WHAT YOU HAD IN HURRICANE SANDY WAS A SUPERSTORM THE LIKES OF WHICH WE HADN 'T SEEN FOR A LONG TIME HITTING THE IPHONE CAPITAL OF THE UNIVERSE
MarkhamNolan_2012S@273.41:288.54 BUT JOKING ASIDE THERE WERE IMAGES LIKE THIS ONE FROM INSTAGRAM WHICH WAS SUBJECTED TO A GRILLING BY JOURNALISTS THEY WEREN 'T REALLY SURE IT WAS FILTERED IN INSTAGRAM THE LIGHTING WAS QUESTIONED EVERYTHING WAS QUESTIONED ABOUT IT AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE IT WAS FROM AVENUE C IN DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN WHICH WAS FLOODED
MarkhamNolan_2012S@288.54:303.37 AND THE REASON THAT THEY COULD TELL THAT IT WAS REAL WAS BECAUSE THEY COULD GET TO THE SOURCE AND IN THIS CASE THESE GUYS WERE NEW YORK FOOD BLOGGERS THEY WERE WELL RESPECTED THEY WERE KNOWN SO THIS ONE WASN 'T A DEBUNK IT WAS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD PROVE AND THAT WAS THE JOB OF THE JOURNALIST IT WAS FILTERING ALL THIS STUFF
MarkhamNolan_2012S@303.37:320.31 AND YOU WERE INSTEAD OF GOING AND FINDING THE INFORMATION AND BRINGING IT BACK TO THE READER YOU WERE HOLDING BACK THE STUFF THAT WAS POTENTIALLY DAMAGING AND FINDING THE SOURCE BECOMES MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT FINDING THE GOOD SOURCE AND TWITTER IS WHERE MOST JOURNALISTS NOW GO IT 'S LIKE THE DE FACTO REAL TIME NEWSWIRE
MarkhamNolan_2012S@320.31:323.38 IF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH ON TWITTER
MarkhamNolan_2012S@323.38:333.91 AND A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW USEFUL IT CAN BE BUT ALSO HOW DIFFICULT WAS THE EGYPTIAN REVOLUTION IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AS A NON ARABIC SPEAKER AS SOMEONE WHO WAS LOOKING FROM THE OUTSIDE FROM DUBLIN
MarkhamNolan_2012S@333.91:347.56 TWITTER LISTS AND LISTS OF GOOD SOURCES PEOPLE WE COULD ESTABLISH WERE CREDIBLE WERE REALLY IMPORTANT AND HOW DO YOU BUILD A LIST LIKE THAT FROM SCRATCH WELL IT CAN BE QUITE DIFFICULT BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR THIS VISUALIZATION WAS DONE BY AN ITALIAN ACADEMIC
MarkhamNolan_2012S@347.56:354.98 HE 'S CALLED ANDRE PANNISON AND HE BASICALLY TOOK THE TWITTER CONVERSATION IN TAHRIR SQUARE ON THE DAY THAT HOSNI MUBARAK
MarkhamNolan_2012S@354.98:367.65 WOULD EVENTUALLY RESIGN AND THE DOTS YOU CAN SEE ARE RETWEETS SO WHEN SOMEONE RETWEETS A MESSAGE A CONNECTION IS MADE BETWEEN TWO DOTS AND THE MORE TIMES THAT MESSAGE IS RETWEETED BY OTHER PEOPLE THE MORE YOU GET TO SEE THESE NODES THESE CONNECTIONS BEING MADE
MarkhamNolan_2012S@367.65:370.69 AND IT 'S AN AMAZING WAY OF VISUALIZING THE CONVERSATION BUT WHAT YOU GET IS
MarkhamNolan_2012S@370.69:374.68 HINTS AT WHO IS MORE INTERESTING AND WHO IS WORTH INVESTIGATING
MarkhamNolan_2012S@374.68:392 AND AS THE CONVERSATION GREW AND GREW IT BECAME MORE AND MORE LIVELY AND EVENTUALLY YOU WERE LEFT WITH THIS HUGE BIG RHYTHMIC POINTER OF THIS CONVERSATION YOU COULD FIND THE NODES THOUGH AND THEN YOU WENT AND YOU GO RIGHT I 'VE GOT TO INVESTIGATE THESE PEOPLE THESE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY MAKING SENSE LET 'S SEE WHO THEY ARE
MarkhamNolan_2012S@392.2:408.61 NOW IN THE DELUGE OF INFORMATION THIS IS WHERE THE REAL TIME WEB GETS REALLY INTERESTING FOR A JOURNALIST LIKE MYSELF BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE TOOLS THAN EVER TO DO THAT KIND OF INVESTIGATION AND WHEN YOU START DIGGING INTO THE SOURCES YOU CAN GO FURTHER AND FURTHER THAN YOU EVER COULD BEFORE
MarkhamNolan_2012S@409.38:416.38 SOMETIMES YOU COME ACROSS A PIECE OF CONTENT THAT IS SO COMPELLING YOU WANT TO USE IT YOU 'RE DYING TO USE IT
MarkhamNolan_2012S@449.66:465.85 BUT HOW DO YOU FIND IF THIS PERSON IF IT 'S TRUE IF IT 'S FAKED OR IF IT 'S SOMETHING THAT 'S OLD AND THAT 'S BEEN REPOSTED SO WE SET ABOUT GOING TO WORK ON THIS VIDEO AND THE ONLY THING THAT WE HAD TO GO ON WAS THE USERNAME ON THE YOUTUBE ACCOUNT THERE WAS ONLY ONE VIDEO POSTED TO THAT ACCOUNT AND THE USERNAME WAS RITA KRILL AND WE DIDN 'T KNOW
MarkhamNolan_2012S@470.68:486.56 THE FIRST ONE WAS CALLED SPOKEO WHICH ALLOWED US TO LOOK FOR RITA KRILLS SO WE LOOKED ALL OVER THE U S WE FOUND THEM IN NEW YORK WE FOUND THEM IN PENNSYLVANIA NEVADA AND FLORIDA SO WE WENT AND WE LOOKED FOR A SECOND FREE INTERNET TOOL CALLED WOLFRAM ALPHA AND WE CHECKED THE WEATHER REPORTS FOR THE DAY IN WHICH THIS VIDEO HAD BEEN UPLOADED
MarkhamNolan_2012S@486.56:499.52 AND WHEN WE WENT THROUGH ALL THOSE VARIOUS CITIES WE FOUND THAT IN FLORIDA THERE WERE THUNDERSTORMS AND RAIN ON THE DAY SO WE WENT TO THE WHITE PAGES AND WE FOUND WE LOOKED THROUGH THE RITA KRILLS IN THE PHONEBOOK AND WE LOOKED THROUGH A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ADDRESSES
MarkhamNolan_2012S@519.76:524.66 AND WE WENT BACK TO GOOGLE MAPS AND WE LOOKED A LITTLE BIT CLOSER AND SURE ENOUGH THERE 'S THE
MarkhamNolan_2012S@542.09:555.54 SOMETIMES THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH THOUGH IS A LITTLE BIT LESS FLIPPANT AND IT HAS MUCH GREATER CONSEQUENCES SYRIA HAS BEEN REALLY INTERESTING FOR US BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THE TIME YOU 'RE TRYING TO DEBUNK STUFF THAT CAN BE POTENTIALLY
MarkhamNolan_2012S@555.54:563.6 WAR CRIME EVIDENCE SO THIS IS WHERE YOUTUBE ACTUALLY BECOMES THE MOST IMPORTANT REPOSITORY OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT 'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD
MarkhamNolan_2012S@588.91:607.36 SYRIAN ARMY OFFICERS BODIES OFF THE BRIDGE AND THEY WERE CURSING AND USING BLASPHEMOUS LANGUAGE AND THERE WERE LOTS OF COUNTERCLAIMS ABOUT WHO THEY WERE AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE WHAT THE VIDEO SAID IT WAS SO WE TALKED TO SOME SOURCES IN HAMA WHO WE HAD BEEN BACK AND FORTH WITH ON TWITTER AND WE ASKED THEM ABOUT THIS AND THE BRIDGE WAS INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE IT WAS SOMETHING WE COULD IDENTIFY
MarkhamNolan_2012S@607.36:627.12 THREE DIFFERENT SOURCES SAID THREE DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT THE BRIDGE THEY SAID ONE THE BRIDGE DOESN 'T EXIST ANOTHER ONE SAID THE BRIDGE DOES EXIST BUT IT 'S NOT IN HAMA IT 'S SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THE THIRD ONE SAID I THINK THE BRIDGE DOES EXIST BUT THE DAM UPSTREAM OF THE BRIDGE WAS CLOSED SO THE RIVER SHOULD ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN DRY SO THIS DOESN 'T MAKE SENSE SO THAT WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT GAVE US A CLUE
MarkhamNolan_2012S@627.36:640 WE LOOKED THROUGH THE VIDEO FOR OTHER CLUES WE SAW THE DISTINCTIVE RAILINGS WHICH WE COULD USE WE LOOKED AT THE CURBS THE CURBS WERE THROWING SHADOWS SOUTH SO WE COULD TELL THE BRIDGE WAS RUNNING EAST WEST ACROSS THE RIVER IT HAD BLACK AND WHITE CURBS
MarkhamNolan_2012S@640:654.71 AS WE LOOKED AT THE RIVER ITSELF YOU COULD SEE THERE 'S A CONCRETE STONE ON THE WEST SIDE THERE 'S A CLOUD OF BLOOD THAT 'S BLOOD IN THE RIVER SO THE RIVER IS FLOWING SOUTH TO NORTH THAT 'S WHAT THAT TELLS ME AND ALSO AS YOU LOOK AWAY FROM THE BRIDGE THERE 'S A DIVOT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE BANK AND THE RIVER NARROWS
MarkhamNolan_2012S@654.81:673.81 SO ONTO GOOGLE MAPS WE GO AND WE START LOOKING THROUGH LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE BRIDGE WE GO TO THE DAM THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WE START JUST LITERALLY GOING THROUGH EVERY TIME THAT ROAD CROSSES THE RIVER CROSSING OFF THE BRIDGES THAT DON 'T MATCH WE 'RE LOOKING FOR ONE THAT CROSSES EAST WEST AND WE GET TO HAMA WE GET ALL THE WAY FROM THE DAM TO HAMA AND THERE 'S NO BRIDGE
MarkhamNolan_2012S@673.81:683.89 SO WE GO A BIT FURTHER WE SWITCH TO THE SATELLITE VIEW AND WE FIND ANOTHER BRIDGE AND EVERYTHING STARTS TO LINE UP THE BRIDGE LOOKS LIKE IT 'S CROSSING THE RIVER EAST TO WEST SO THIS COULD BE OUR BRIDGE
MarkhamNolan_2012S@683.89:688.86 AND WE ZOOM RIGHT IN WE START TO SEE THAT IT 'S GOT A MEDIAN SO IT 'S A TWO LANE BRIDGE
MarkhamNolan_2012S@688.86:708.51 AND IT 'S GOT THE BLACK AND WHITE CURBS THAT WE SAW IN THE VIDEO AND AS WE CLICK THROUGH IT YOU CAN SEE SOMEONE 'S UPLOADED PHOTOS TO GO WITH THE MAP WHICH IS VERY HANDY SO WE CLICK INTO THE PHOTOS AND THE PHOTOS START SHOWING US MORE DETAIL THAT WE CAN CROSS REFERENCE WITH THE VIDEO THE FIRST THING THAT WE SEE IS WE SEE BLACK AND WHITE CURBING WHICH IS HANDY BECAUSE WE 'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE
MarkhamNolan_2012S@708.62:713.9 WE SEE THE DISTINCTIVE RAILING THAT WE SAW THE GUYS THROWING THE BODIES OVER
MarkhamNolan_2012S@733.3:739.07 USING SOME FREE INTERNET TOOLS SITTING IN A CUBICLE IN AN OFFICE IN DUBLIN IN THE SPACE OF TWENTY MINUTES
MarkhamNolan_2012S@739.07:758.54 AND THAT 'S PART OF THE JOY OF THIS ALTHOUGH THE WEB IS RUNNING LIKE A TORRENT THERE 'S SO MUCH INFORMATION THERE THAT IT 'S INCREDIBLY HARD TO SIFT AND GETTING HARDER EVERY DAY IF YOU USE THEM INTELLIGENTLY YOU CAN FIND OUT INCREDIBLE INFORMATION GIVEN A COUPLE OF CLUES I COULD PROBABLY FIND OUT A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT MOST OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE THAT YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE ME FINDING OUT BUT WHAT IT TELLS ME IS THAT
MarkhamNolan_2012S@759.02:765.34 AT A TIME WHEN THERE 'S MORE THERE 'S A GREATER ABUNDANCE OF INFORMATION THAN THERE EVER HAS BEEN IT 'S HARDER TO FILTER
MarkhamNolan_2012S@765.34:780.29 WE HAVE GREATER TOOLS WE HAVE FREE INTERNET TOOLS THAT ALLOW US HELP US DO THIS KIND OF INVESTIGATION WE HAVE ALGORITHMS THAT ARE SMARTER THAN EVER BEFORE AND COMPUTERS THAT ARE QUICKER THAN EVER BEFORE BUT HERE 'S THE THING ALGORITHMS ARE RULES THEY 'RE BINARY THEY 'RE YES OR NO THEY 'RE BLACK OR WHITE
MarkhamNolan_2012S@780.29:788.25 TRUTH IS NEVER BINARY TRUTH IS A VALUE TRUTH IS EMOTIONAL IT 'S FLUID AND ABOVE ALL IT 'S HUMAN
MarkhamNolan_2012S@788.25:800.74 NO MATTER HOW QUICK WE GET WITH COMPUTERS NO MATTER HOW MUCH INFORMATION WE HAVE YOU 'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO REMOVE THE HUMAN FROM THE TRUTH SEEKING EXERCISE BECAUSE IN THE END IT IS A UNIQUELY HUMAN TRAIT THANKS VERY MUCH
