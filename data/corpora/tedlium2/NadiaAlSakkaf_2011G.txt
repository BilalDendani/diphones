NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G US IMAGES FROM THE YEMEN TIMES
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G TAKE US THROUGH THOSE AND INTRODUCE US TO ANOTHER YEMEN
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G HAPPENING TODAY IN YEMEN THIS PICTURE SHOWS A REVOLUTION STARTED BY WOMEN AND IT SHOWS WOMEN AND MEN LEADING A MIXED PROTEST
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G THE OTHER PICTURE IS THE POPULARITY OF THE REAL NEED FOR CHANGE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE THERE THE INTENSITY OF THE
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G I LOVE THIS PICTURE I JUST WANTED TO SHOW THAT OVER SIXTY PERCENT OF THE YEMENI POPULATION ARE FIFTEEN YEARS AND BELOW AND THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM DECISION MAKING AND NOW THEY ARE IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE NEWS RAISING THE FLAG
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G PAINTINGS COMICS
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G TO TELL THE WORLD AND EACH OTHER ABOUT WHAT 'S GOING ON
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G OBVIOUSLY THERE 'S ALWAYS THE DARK SIDE OF IT AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE LESS GRUESOME PICTURES OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE COST THAT WE HAVE TO PAY
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G THE SOLIDARITY OF MILLIONS OF YEMENIS ACROSS THE COUNTRY JUST DEMANDING THE ONE THING AND FINALLY LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT YEMEN 'S REVOLUTION IS GOING TO BREAK THE COUNTRY
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G IS IT GOING TO BE SO MANY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IS IT GOING TO BE ANOTHER SOMALIA BUT WE WANT TO TELL THE WORLD THAT NO UNDER THE ONE FLAG WE 'LL STILL REMAIN AS YEMENI
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G CHARACTERIZATIONS SO LET 'S TALK ABOUT THE PERSONAL STORY FOR A MOMENT
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G BUT THERE 'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL I WISH I COULD SHOW YOU MY YEMEN I WISH YOU COULD SEE
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G AND EVEN MY MOTHER I OWE IT TO MY FAMILY A STORY I STUDIED IN INDIA AND IN MY THIRD YEAR I STARTED BECOMING CONFUSED
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G BECAUSE I WAS YEMENI BUT I WAS ALSO MIXING UP WITH A LOT OF MY FRIENDS IN COLLEGE AND I WENT BACK HOME AND I SAID DADDY I DON 'T KNOW WHO I AM I 'M NOT A YEMENI I 'M NOT AN INDIAN AND HE SAID YOU ARE THE BRIDGE AND
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G A WOMAN 'S GOT TO DO WHAT A WOMAN 'S GOT TO DO
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G BUT IN ASSUMING THIS RESPONSIBILITY AND GOING ABOUT IT AS YOU HAVE YOU HAVE BECOME A BRIDGE BETWEEN
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G AN OLDER AND TRADITIONAL SOCIETY AND THE ONE THAT YOU ARE NOW CREATING AT THE PAPER AND SO ALONG WITH CHANGING WHO WORKED THERE YOU MUST HAVE COME UP AGAINST ANOTHER POSITIONING THAT WE ALWAYS RUN INTO IN PARTICULAR WITH WOMEN AND IT HAS TO DO WITH OUTSIDE IMAGE
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G DRESS THE VEILED WOMAN SO HOW HAVE YOU DEALT WITH THIS ON A PERSONAL LEVEL AS WELL AS THE WOMEN WHO WORKED FOR YOU
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G AND THE MORE EMPOWERED THE WOMEN BECOME THE MORE THEY ARE ABLE TO REMOVE THE VEIL FOR EXAMPLE OR TO DRIVE THEIR OWN CAR OR TO HAVE A JOB OR TO BE ABLE TO TRAVEL SO
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G AND SO ON IT 'S JUST A MOVEMENT AND I AM A ROLE MODEL IN YEMEN A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOK UP TO ME A LOT OF YOUNG GIRLS LOOK UP TO ME AND I NEED TO PROVE TO THEM THAT YES YOU CAN STILL BE MARRIED YOU CAN STILL BE A MOTHER AND YOU CAN STILL BE RESPECTED WITHIN THE SOCIETY BUT AT THE SAME TIME THAT DOESN 'T MEAN YOU SHOULD JUST BE ONE OF THE CROWD
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G YOU CAN BE YOURSELF AND HAVE YOUR FACE
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G TELL THAT TO THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE THEY THINK THAT IF THERE 'S ANYTHING AGAINST THEM THEN WE ARE BEING AN OPPOSITION NEWSPAPER AND VERY VERY DIFFICULT TIMES SOME OF MY REPORTERS WERE ARRESTED WE HAD SOME COURT CASES MY FATHER WAS ASSASSINATED
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G AND IT 'S VERY IMPORTANT TO LISTEN TO OUR VOICE AND THIS IS PROBABLY SOMETHING I 'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU IN WESTERN MEDIA PROBABLY AND HOW
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G THERE 'S A LOT OF STEREOTYPES THINKING OF YEMEN IN ONE SINGLE FRAME THIS IS WHAT YEMEN IS ALL ABOUT AND THAT 'S NOT FAIR IT 'S NOT FAIR FOR ME IT 'S NOT FAIR FOR MY COUNTRY A LOT OF REPORTERS COME TO YEMEN AND THEY WANT TO WRITE A STORY ON AL QAEDA OR TERRORISM
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G CERTAINLY WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WAYS IN WHICH WE HAVE SEPARATED OURSELVES FROM OTHERS AND WE 'VE CREATED FEAR AND DANGER OFTEN FROM LACK OF KNOWLEDGE LACK OF REAL UNDERSTANDING HOW DO YOU SEE THE WAY THAT
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G WESTERN PRESS IN PARTICULAR IS COVERING THIS AND ALL OTHER STORIES OUT OF THE REGION BUT IN PARTICULAR IN YOUR COUNTRY
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G THINK THAT YOU 'VE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK AND A STORY SO I WISH THAT THE WORLD WOULD KNOW MY YEMEN MY COUNTRY MY PEOPLE
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G YOU YOURSELF AND WHAT YOU DO
