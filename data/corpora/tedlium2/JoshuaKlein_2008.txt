JoshuaKlein_2008@16.88:20.51 HITCHCOCK FILM THE BIRDS ANY OF YOU GET REALLY FREAKED OUT BY
JoshuaKlein_2008@24.49:36.66 SO THIS IS A VENDING MACHINE FOR CROWS AND OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN ASKING ME HOW DID YOU COME TO THIS HOW DID YOU GET STARTED DOING THIS AND IT STARTED AS WITH MANY GREAT IDEAS OR MANY IDEAS YOU CAN'T GET RID OF ANYWAY AT A COCKTAIL PARTY
JoshuaKlein_2008@37.05:45.02 ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO I WAS AT A COCKTAIL PARTY WITH A FRIEND OF MINE AND WE'RE SITTING THERE AND HE WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT THE CROWS THAT HE HAD SEEN THAT WERE ALL OVER HIS YARD AND MAKING A BIG MESS
JoshuaKlein_2008@45.69:54.77 ME THAT REALLY WE OUGHT TO TRY AND ERADICATE THESE THINGS WE GOTTA KILL THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE MAKING A MESS I SAID THAT WAS STUPID YOU KNOW MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST TRAIN THEM TO DO SOMETHING USEFUL AND HE SAID THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
JoshuaKlein_2008@55.26:63.06 AND I'M SURE I'M IN GOOD COMPANY IN FINDING THAT TREMENDOUSLY ANNOYING WHEN SOMEONE TELLS YOU IT'S IMPOSSIBLE SO I SPENT THE NEXT TEN YEARS READING ABOUT CROWS IN MY SPARE TIME
JoshuaKlein_2008@66.79:75.89 AND AFTER TEN YEARS OF THIS MY WIFE EVENTUALLY SAID LOOK YOU KNOW YOU GOTTA DO THIS THING YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND BUILD THE VENDING MACHINE SO I DID BUT PART OF THE REASON THAT I FOUND THIS INTERESTING IS THAT I
JoshuaKlein_2008@76.54:86.31 STARTED NOTICING THAT WE ARE VERY AWARE OF ALL THE SPECIES THAT ARE GOING EXTINCT ON THE PLANET AS A RESULT OF HUMAN HABITATION EXPANSION AND NO ONE SEEMS TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO ALL THE SPECIES THAT ARE ACTUALLY LIVING
JoshuaKlein_2008@86.81:97.08 ARE SURVIVING AND I'M TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SYNANTHROPIC SPECIES WHICH ARE SPECIES THAT HAVE ADAPTED SPECIFICALLY FOR HUMAN ECOLOGIES SPECIES LIKE RATS AND COCKROACHES AND CROWS
JoshuaKlein_2008@97.60:105.94 AND AS I STARTED LOOKING AT THEM I WAS FINDING THAT THEY HAD HYPER ADAPTED THEY'D BECOME EXTREMELY ADEPT AT LIVING WITH US AND IN RETURN WE JUST TRIED TO KILL THEM ALL THE TIME
JoshuaKlein_2008@107.27:110.90 AND IN DOING SO WE WERE BREEDING THEM FOR PARASITISM WE WERE GIVING THEM ALL SORTS OF
JoshuaKlein_2008@122.79:132.67 SO I THOUGHT LET 'S BUILD SOMETHING THAT'S MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL WELL THEN LET 'S BUILD SOMETHING THAT WE CAN BOTH BENEFIT FROM AND FIND SOME WAY TO MAKE A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE SPECIES AND SO I BUILT THE VENDING MACHINE
JoshuaKlein_2008@141.57:153.68 THEY'RE FOUND EVERYWHERE ON THE PLANET EXCEPT FOR THE ARCTIC AND THE SOUTHERN TIP OF SOUTH AMERICA AND IN ALL THAT AREA THEY'RE ONLY RARELY FOUND BREEDING MORE THAN FIVE KILOMETERS AWAY FROM HUMAN BEINGS SO WE MAY NOT THINK ABOUT THEM BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS AROUND
JoshuaKlein_2008@154.32:165.83 AND NOT SURPRISINGLY GIVEN THE HUMAN POPULATION GROWTH MORE THAN HALF OF THE HUMAN POPULATION IS LIVING IN CITIES NOW AND OUT OF THOSE NINE TENTHS OF THE HUMAN GROWTH POPULATION IS OCCURRING IN CITIES WE'RE SEEING A POPULATION BOOM WITH CROWS
JoshuaKlein_2008@166.34:178.37 SO BIRD COUNTS ARE INDICATING THAT WE MIGHT BE SEEING UP TO EXPONENTIAL GROWTH IN THEIR NUMBERS SO THAT'S NO GREAT SURPRISE BUT WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO ME WAS TO FIND OUT THAT THE BIRDS WERE ADAPTING IN A PRETTY UNUSUAL WAY
JoshuaKlein_2008@179.71:180.76 AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
JoshuaKlein_2008@182.18:190.92 SO THIS IS BETTY SHE'S A NEW CALEDONIAN CROW AND THESE CROWS USE STICKS IN THE WILD TO GET INSECTS AND WHATNOT OUT OF PIECES OF WOOD HERE SHE'S TRYING TO GET A PIECE OF MEAT OUT OF
JoshuaKlein_2008@204.18:214.54 THIS IS COMPLETELY UNPROMPTED SHE HAD NEVER SEEN THIS DONE BEFORE NO ONE TAUGHT HER TO BEND THIS INTO A HOOK HAD SHOWN HER HOW IT COULD HAPPEN BUT SHE DID IT ALL ON HER OWN SO KEEP IN MIND THAT SHE'S NEVER SEEN THIS DONE
JoshuaKlein_2008@235.26:242.60 SO IT TURNS OUT WE'VE BEEN FINDING MORE AND MORE THAT CROWS ARE REALLY REALLY INTELLIGENT THEIR BRAINS ARE PROPORTIONATE IN THE SAME PROPORTION AS CHIMPANZEE BRAINS ARE
JoshuaKlein_2008@252.76:257.98 THE CROWS FLY DOWN REEL UP THE LINES AND EAT THE FISH OR THE BAIT IT'S PRETTY ANNOYING FOR THE FISHERMEN
JoshuaKlein_2008@259.06:267.27 AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TACK AT UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON THEY A FEW YEARS AGO WERE DOING AN EXPERIMENT WHERE THEY CAPTURED SOME CROWS ON CAMPUS SOME STUDENTS WENT OUT AND NETTED SOME CROWS
JoshuaKlein_2008@282.26:286.02 THEY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS ENTERTAINED WHEN THIS WENT ON FOR THE NEXT WEEK
JoshuaKlein_2008@301.71:306.69 NOW STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON THAT ARE STUDYING THESE CROWS DO SO WITH A GIANT WIG AND A BIG MASK
JoshuaKlein_2008@311.96:318.27 SO WE KNOW THAT THESE CROWS ARE REALLY SMART BUT THE MORE I DUG INTO THIS THE MORE I FOUND THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE AN EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT ADAPTATION
JoshuaKlein_2008@320.51:332.05 CROWS HAVE BECOME HIGHLY SKILLED AT MAKING A LIVING IN THESE NEW URBAN ENVIRONMENTS IN THIS JAPANESE CITY THEY HAVE DEVISED A WAY OF EATING A FOOD THAT NORMALLY THEY CAN'T MANAGE
JoshuaKlein_2008@369.95:375.28 PRETTY INTERESTING SO WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THIS ISN'T THAT CROWS ARE USING CARS TO CRACK NUTS IN FACT THAT'S
JoshuaKlein_2008@376.65:382.58 THIS HAPPENED ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO IN A PLACE CALLED SENDAI CITY AT A DRIVING SCHOOL IN THE SUBURBS OF TOKYO
JoshuaKlein_2008@383.14:391.56 AND SINCE THAT TIME ALL OF THE CROWS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ARE PICKING UP THIS BEHAVIOR AND NOW EVERY CROW WITHIN FIVE KILOMETERS IS STANDING BY A SIDEWALK WAITING TO COLLECT ITS LUNCH
JoshuaKlein_2008@392.42:404.90 SO THEY'RE LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER AND RESEARCH BEARS THIS OUT PARENTS SEEM TO BE TEACHING THEIR YOUNG THEY'VE LEARNED FROM THEIR PEERS THEY'VE LEARNED FROM THEIR ENEMIES IF I HAVE A LITTLE EXTRA TIME I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT A CASE OF CROW INFIDELITY THAT ILLUSTRATES THAT NICELY
JoshuaKlein_2008@406.35:413.79 THE POINT BEING THAT THEY'VE DEVELOPED CULTURAL ADAPTATION AND AS WE HEARD YESTERDAY THAT'S THE PANDORA 'S BOX THAT'S GETTING HUMAN BEINGS IN TROUBLE AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE IT WITH
JoshuaKlein_2008@414.60:422.13 THEY'RE ABLE TO VERY QUICKLY AND VERY FLEXIBLY ADAPT TO NEW CHALLENGES AND NEW RESOURCES IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS REALLY USEFUL IF YOU LIVE IN A CITY
JoshuaKlein_2008@424.11:433.20 SO WE KNOW THAT THERE'S LOTS OF CROWS WE FOUND OUT THEY'RE REALLY SMART AND WE FOUND OUT THAT THEY CAN TEACH EACH OTHER AND WHEN ALL THIS BECAME CLEAR TO ME I REALIZED THE ONLY OBVIOUS THING TO DO IS BUILD A VENDING MACHINE
JoshuaKlein_2008@433.70:441.14 SO THAT'S WHAT WE DID THIS IS A VENDING MACHINE FOR CROWS AND IT USES SKINNERIAN TRAINING TO SHAPE THEIR BEHAVIOR OVER FOUR STAGES IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE
JoshuaKlein_2008@468.79:475.02 TO THE CROWS COMING BACK NOW THEY'RE USED TO THE SOUND OF THE MACHINE AND THEY KEEP COMING BACK AND DIGGING OUT THESE PEANUTS FROM AMONGST THE PILE OF COINS THAT'S THERE
JoshuaKlein_2008@485.51:494.52 SO THEY DO WHAT THEY DO IN NATURE WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THEY SWEEP THINGS OUT OF THE WAY WITH THEIR BEAK AND THEY DO THAT HERE AND THAT KNOCKS THE COINS DOWN THE SLOT AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS THEY GET A PEANUT
JoshuaKlein_2008@494.92:506.69 AND SO THIS GOES ON FOR SOME TIME THE CROWS LEARN THAT ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS SHOW UP WAIT FOR THE COIN TO COME OUT PUT THE COIN IN THE SLOT AND THEN THEY GET THEIR PEANUT AND WHEN THEY'RE REALLY GOOD AND COMFORTABLE WITH THAT WE MOVE TO THE FINAL STAGE IN WHICH THEY SHOW UP AND NOTHING HAPPENS
JoshuaKlein_2008@508.10:513.34 AND THIS IS WHERE WE SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CROWS AND OTHER ANIMALS SQUIRRELS FOR EXAMPLE WOULD SHOW UP LOOK FOR THE
JoshuaKlein_2008@514.28:517.57 GO AWAY COME BACK LOOK FOR THE PEANUT GO AWAY
JoshuaKlein_2008@518.30:524.25 MAYBE HALF A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE THEY GET BORED AND THEN THEY GO OFF AND PLAY IN TRAFFIC CROWS ON THE OTHER HAND
JoshuaKlein_2008@524.73:529.38 SHOW UP AND THEY TRY AND FIGURE IT OUT THEY KNOW THAT THIS MACHINE 'S BEEN MESSING WITH THEM THROUGH THREE DIFFERENT STAGES OF
JoshuaKlein_2008@532.06:541.44 IT'S GOTTA HAVE MORE TO IT SO THEY POKE AT IT AND PECK AT IT AND WHATNOT AND EVENTUALLY SOME CROW GETS A BRIGHT IDEA THAT HEY THERE'S LOTS OF COINS LYING AROUND FROM THE FIRST STAGE LYING AROUND ON THE GROUND
JoshuaKlein_2008@542.06:550.45 DOWN PICKS IT UP DROPS IT IN THE SLOT AND THEN WE'RE OFF TO THE RACES THAT CROW ENJOYS A TEMPORARY MONOPOLY ON PEANUTS UNTIL HIS FRIENDS FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT AND THEN
JoshuaKlein_2008@552.21:563.11 SO WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THIS TO ME ISN'T THAT WE CAN TRAIN CROWS TO PICK UP PEANUTS MIND YOU THERE'S TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CHANGE LOST EVERY YEAR BUT I'M NOT SURE I CAN DEPEND ON THAT ROI FROM CROWS
JoshuaKlein_2008@564.32:566.84 INSTEAD I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK A LITTLE BIT LARGER
JoshuaKlein_2008@567.49:577.96 I THINK THAT CROWS CAN BE TRAINED TO DO OTHER THINGS FOR EXAMPLE WHY NOT TRAIN THEM TO PICK UP GARBAGE AFTER STADIUM EVENTS OR FIND EXPENSIVE COMPONENTS FROM DISCARDED ELECTRONICS OR MAYBE DO SEARCH AND RESCUE
JoshuaKlein_2008@578.70:586.18 THE MAIN THING THE MAIN POINT OF ALL THIS FOR ME IS THAT WE CAN FIND MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL SYSTEMS FOR THESE SPECIES WE CAN FIND WAYS TO INTERACT WITH THESE OTHER SPECIES THAT
