ElizabethPisani_2010@21.05:26.75 THIS WAS A HEADLINE IN A U K NEWSPAPER THE GUARDIAN NOT THAT LONG AGO I'M CURIOUS SHOW OF HANDS WHO AGREES WITH IT
ElizabethPisani_2010@30.12:36.92 TWO BRAVE SOULS THIS IS ACTUALLY A DIRECT QUOTE FROM AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST WHO 'S BEEN IN FIELD OF HIV FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
ElizabethPisani_2010@37.37:40.22 FOUR CONTINENTS AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT HER
ElizabethPisani_2010@41.32:44.63 AND I AM NOW GOING TO ARGUE THAT THIS IS ONLY HALF TRUE
ElizabethPisani_2010@53.90:65.57 IS THE DOMINANT PARADIGM IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND IF YOU PUT YOUR PUBLIC HEALTH NERD GLASSES ON YOU'LL SEE THAT IF WE GIVE PEOPLE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED ABOUT WHAT'S GOOD FOR THEM AND WHAT'S BAD FOR THEM
ElizabethPisani_2010@65.84:76.40 IF YOU GIVE THEM THE SERVICES THAT THEY CAN USE TO ACT ON THAT INFORMATION AND A LITTLE BIT OF MOTIVATION PEOPLE WILL MAKE RATIONAL DECISIONS AND LIVE LONG AND HEALTHY LIVES WONDERFUL
ElizabethPisani_2010@101.61:112.14 LET 'S START WITH WHAT'S RATIONAL FOR AN ADDICT NOW I REMEMBER SPEAKING TO AN INDONESIAN FRIEND OF MINE FRANKIE WE WERE HAVING LUNCH AND HE WAS TELLING ME ABOUT WHEN HE WAS IN JAIL IN BALI FOR A DRUG INJECTION
ElizabethPisani_2010@112.66:120.58 AND IT WAS SOMEONE 'S BIRTHDAY AND THEY HAD VERY KINDLY SMUGGLED SOME HEROIN IN TO THE JAIL AND HE WAS VERY GENEROUSLY SHARING IT OUT WITH ALL OF HIS
ElizabethPisani_2010@121.16:129.33 COLLEAGUES AND SO EVERYONE LINED UP ALL THE SMACKHEADS IN A ROW AND THE GUY WHOSE BIRTHDAY IT WAS FILLED UP THE
ElizabethPisani_2010@129.93:143.01 FIT AND HE WENT DOWN AND STARTED INJECTING PEOPLE SO HE INJECTS THE FIRST GUY AND THEN HE 'S WIPING THE NEEDLE ON HIS SHIRT AND HE INJECTS THE NEXT GUY AND FRANKIE SAID I 'M NUMBER TWENTY TWO IN LINE
ElizabethPisani_2010@143.48:153.06 AND I CAN SEE THE NEEDLE COMING DOWN TOWARDS ME AND THERE IS BLOOD ALL OVER THE PLACE IT'S GETTING BLUNTER AND BLUNTER AND A SMALL PART OF MY BRAIN IS THINKING
ElizabethPisani_2010@153.93:154.79 THAT IS
ElizabethPisani_2010@156.62:160.99 REALLY DANGEROUS BUT MOST OF MY BRAIN IS THINKING PLEASE LET THERE BE SOME
ElizabethPisani_2010@161.50:164.76 LEFT BY THE TIME IT GETS TO ME PLEASE LET THERE BE SOME
ElizabethPisani_2010@176.83:178.06 FOR ACCURACY
ElizabethPisani_2010@179.21:179.87 BUT ACTUALLY
ElizabethPisani_2010@181.09:190.96 AT THAT TIME WAS A HEROIN ADDICT AND HE WAS IN JAIL SO HIS CHOICE WAS EITHER TO ACCEPT THAT DIRTY NEEDLE OR NOT TO GET HIGH AND IF THERE'S ONE PLACE YOU REALLY WANT TO GET HIGH IT'S
ElizabethPisani_2010@191.46:198.16 WHEN YOU'RE IN JAIL BUT I'M A SCIENTIST AND I DON'T LIKE TO MAKE DATA OUT OF ANECDOTES SO LET 'S LOOK AT SOME
ElizabethPisani_2010@200.01:210.27 TO SIX HUNDRED DRUG ADDICTS IN THREE CITIES IN INDONESIA AND WE SAID WELL DO YOU KNOW HOW YOU GET HIV OH YEAH BY SHARING NEEDLES I MEAN NEARLY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT YEAH BY SHARING NEEDLES
ElizabethPisani_2010@210.68:221.03 AND DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN GET A CLEAN NEEDLE AT A PRICE YOU CAN AFFORD TO AVOID THAT OH YEAH ONE HUNDRED PERCENT WE 'RE SMACKHEADS WE KNOW WHERE TO GET CLEAN NEEDLES SO ARE YOU CARRYING A NEEDLE WE'RE ACTUALLY
ElizabethPisani_2010@229.99:238.15 SO NO SURPRISES THEN THAT THE PROPORTION THAT ACTUALLY USED CLEAN NEEDLES EVERY TIME THEY INJECTED IN THE LAST WEEK IS JUST ABOUT ONE IN
ElizabethPisani_2010@238.54:245.10 TEN AND THE OTHER NINE IN TEN ARE SHARING SO YOU'VE GOT THIS MASSIVE MISMATCH EVERYONE KNOWS
ElizabethPisani_2010@245.49:253.29 THAT IF THEY SHARE THEY'RE GOING TO GET HIV BUT THEY'RE ALL SHARING ANYWAY SO WHAT'S THAT ABOUT IS IT LIKE YOU GET A BETTER HIGH IF YOU SHARE OR SOMETHING WE ASKED THAT TO
ElizabethPisani_2010@255.91:264.94 WANT TO SHARE A NEEDLE ANYMORE THAN YOU WANT TO SHARE A TOOTHBRUSH EVEN WITH SOMEONE YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH THERE'S JUST AN ICK FACTOR THERE NO NO WE SHARE NEEDLES BECAUSE WE DON'T
ElizabethPisani_2010@266.96:269.41 SO IN INDONESIA AT THIS TIME
ElizabethPisani_2010@270.39:277.75 IF YOU WERE CARRYING A NEEDLE AND THE COPS ROUNDED YOU UP THEY COULD PUT YOU INTO JAIL AND THAT CHANGES THE EQUATION SLIGHTLY DOESN'T IT BECAUSE
ElizabethPisani_2010@278.50:285.67 YOUR CHOICE NOW IS EITHER I USE MY OWN NEEDLE NOW OR I COULD SHARE A NEEDLE NOW AND
ElizabethPisani_2010@286.15:293.44 GET A DISEASE THAT'S GOING TO POSSIBLY KILL ME TEN YEARS FROM NOW OR I COULD USE MY OWN NEEDLE NOW AND
ElizabethPisani_2010@293.93:304.81 GO TO JAIL TOMORROW AND WHILE JUNKIES THINK THAT IT'S A REALLY BAD IDEA TO EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO HIV THEY THINK IT'S A MUCH WORSE IDEA TO SPEND THE NEXT YEAR IN JAIL
ElizabethPisani_2010@305.12:312.86 WHERE THEY'LL PROBABLY END UP IN FRANKIE 'S SITUATION AND EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO HIV ANYWAY SO SUDDENLY IT BECOMES PERFECTLY RATIONAL TO SHARE NEEDLES
ElizabethPisani_2010@313.30:323.25 NOW LET 'S LOOK AT IT FROM A POLICY MAKER 'S POINT OF VIEW THIS IS A REALLY EASY PROBLEM FOR ONCE YOUR INCENTIVES ARE ALIGNED WE'VE GOT WHAT'S RATIONAL FOR PUBLIC HEALTH
ElizabethPisani_2010@323.70:334.05 YOU WANT PEOPLE TO USE CLEAN NEEDLES AND JUNKIES WANT TO USE CLEAN NEEDLES SO WE COULD MAKE THIS PROBLEM GO AWAY SIMPLY BY MAKING CLEAN NEEDLES UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE AND TAKING AWAY THE FEAR OF ARREST
ElizabethPisani_2010@334.58:342.58 NOW THE FIRST PERSON TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT ON A NATIONAL SCALE WAS THAT WELL KNOWN BLEEDING HEART LIBERAL MARGARET THATCHER
ElizabethPisani_2010@343.38:354.55 AND SHE PUT IN THE WORLD 'S FIRST NATIONAL NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM AND OTHER COUNTRIES FOLLOWED SUIT AUSTRALIA THE NETHERLANDS AND FEW OTHERS AND IN ALL OF THOSE COUNTRIES YOU CAN SEE NOT MORE THAN FOUR PERCENT
ElizabethPisani_2010@354.82:362.52 EVER BECAME INFECTED WITH HIV OF INJECTORS IN PLACES THAT DIDN'T DO THIS NEW YORK CITY FOR EXAMPLE MOSCOW JAKARTA
ElizabethPisani_2010@363.52:370.92 AT ITS PEAK ONE IN TWO INJECTORS INFECTED WITH THIS FATAL DISEASE NOW
ElizabethPisani_2010@380.50:388.76 SO IF SHE DIDN'T INVEST IN EFFECTIVE PREVENTION SHE WAS GOING TO HAVE PICK UP THE COSTS OF TREATMENT LATER ON AND OBVIOUSLY THOSE ARE MUCH HIGHER
ElizabethPisani_2010@389.01:396.52 SO SHE WAS MAKING A POLITICALLY RATIONAL DECISION NOW IF I TAKE OUT MY PUBLIC HEALTH NERD GLASSES
ElizabethPisani_2010@397.32:398.95 AND LOOK AT THESE DATA
ElizabethPisani_2010@400.29:402.10 IT SEEMS LIKE A NO BRAINER DOESN'T IT
ElizabethPisani_2010@403.09:404.74 BUT IN THIS COUNTRY
ElizabethPisani_2010@404.96:416.04 WHERE THE GOVERNMENT APPARENTLY DOES NOT FEEL COMPELLED TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE FOR CITIZENS WE'VE TAKEN A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN THE UNITED STATES IS REVIEWING THE DATA
ElizabethPisani_2010@438.90:440.40 THE WHOLE SLIDE
ElizabethPisani_2010@442.39:446.43 THERE IS NOTHING ON THE OTHER SIDE
ElizabethPisani_2010@447.99:454.26 SO COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL YOU WOULD THINK EXCEPT THAT WAIT A MINUTE POLITICIANS ARE RATIONAL
ElizabethPisani_2010@454.98:464.64 AND THEY'RE RESPONDING TO WHAT THEY THINK THE VOTES WANT SO WHAT WE SEE IS THAT VOTERS RESPOND VERY WELL TO THINGS LIKE THIS AND NOT QUITE SO WELL TO THINGS LIKE THIS
ElizabethPisani_2010@488.96:496.91 THINK SOMEHOW THAT IF YOU GIVE OUT CONDOMS EVERYONE 'S GOING TO RUN OUT AND HAVE SEX I DON'T KNOW IF
ElizabethPisani_2010@499.33:505.83 BUT IF YOU DO I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU BENEDICT I CARRY CONDOMS ALL THE TIME AND
ElizabethPisani_2010@522.18:524.08 HIV IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT EASY
ElizabethPisani_2010@524.36:537.26 TO TRANSMIT SEXUALLY SO IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH VIRUS THERE IS IN YOUR BLOOD AND IN YOUR BODY FLUIDS AND WHAT WE'VE GOT IS A VERY VERY HIGH LEVEL OF VIRUS RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING WHEN YOU'RE FIRST INFECTED THEN YOU START MAKING ANTIBODIES
ElizabethPisani_2010@537.54:545.84 AND THEN IT BUMPS ALONG AT QUITE LOW LEVELS FOR A LONG TIME TEN OR TWELVE YEARS YOU HAVE SPIKES IF YOU GET ANOTHER SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION BUT BASICALLY NOTHING MUCH IS GOING ON
ElizabethPisani_2010@546.25:554.53 UNTIL YOU START TO GET SYMPTOMATIC AIDS AND BY THAT STAGE OVER HERE YOU'RE NOT LOOKING GREAT YOU'RE NOT FEELING GREAT YOU'RE NOT HAVING THAT MUCH SEX
ElizabethPisani_2010@554.94:565.10 SO THE SEXUAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV IS ESSENTIALLY DETERMINED BY HOW MANY PARTNERS YOU HAVE IN THESE VERY SHORT SPACES OF TIME WHEN YOU HAVE PEAK VIREMIA NOW
ElizabethPisani_2010@585.83:598.09 THE TRUTH IS THAT TWENTY YEARS OF VERY GOOD RESEARCH HAVE SHOWN US THAT THERE ARE GROUPS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO TURN OVER LARGE NUMBERS OF PARTNERS IN A SHORT SPACE OF TIME AND THOSE GROUPS ARE GLOBALLY
ElizabethPisani_2010@598.35:607.65 PEOPLE WHO SELL SEX AND THEIR MORE REGULAR PARTNERS THEY ARE GAY MEN ON THE PARTY SCENE WHO HAVE ON AVERAGE THREE TIMES MORE PARTNERS THAN STRAIGHT PEOPLE ON THE PARTY SCENE
ElizabethPisani_2010@608.04:616.03 AND THEY ARE HETEROSEXUALS WHO COME FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TRADITIONS OF POLYGAMY AND RELATIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF FEMALE AUTONOMY
ElizabethPisani_2010@616.30:627.59 AND ALMOST ALL OF THOSE COUNTRIES ARE IN EAST OR SOUTHERN AFRICA AND THAT IS REFLECTED IN THE EPIDEMIC THAT WE HAVE TODAY SO YOU CAN SEE THESE HORRIFYING FIGURES FROM AFRICA THESE ARE ALL COUNTRIES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA WHERE
ElizabethPisani_2010@627.84:635.32 BETWEEN ONE IN SEVEN AND ONE IN THREE OF ALL ADULTS ARE INFECTED WITH HIV
ElizabethPisani_2010@636.07:645.14 NOW IN THE REST OF THE WORLD WE'VE GOT BASICALLY NOTHING GOING ON IN THE GENERAL POPULATION VERY VERY LOW LEVELS BUT WE HAVE EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH LEVELS OF HIV
ElizabethPisani_2010@645.52:656.13 IN THESE OTHER POPULATIONS WHO ARE AT HIGHEST RISK SO DRUG INJECTORS SEX WORKERS AND GAY MEN AND YOU'LL NOTE THAT'S THE LOCAL DATA FROM LOS ANGELES TWENTY FIVE PERCENT
ElizabethPisani_2010@658.78:667.17 OF COURSE YOU CAN'T GET HIV JUST BY HAVING UNPROTECTED SEX YOU CAN ONLY HIV BY HAVING UNPROTECTED SEX WITH A POSITIVE PERSON
ElizabethPisani_2010@668.53:679.09 MOST OF THE WORLD THESE FEW PREVENTION FAILURES NOT WITHSTANDING WE ARE ACTUALLY DOING QUITE WELL THESE DAYS IN COMMERCIAL SEX CONDOM USE RATES ARE BETWEEN
ElizabethPisani_2010@679.50:688.63 EIGHTY AND ONE HUNDRED PERCENT IN COMMERCIAL SEX IN MOST COUNTRIES AND AGAIN IT'S BECAUSE OF AN ALIGNMENT OF THE INCENTIVES WHAT'S RATIONAL FOR PUBLIC HEALTH IS ALSO RATIONAL FOR INDIVIDUAL
ElizabethPisani_2010@688.96:702.01 SEX WORKERS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY BAD FOR BUSINESS TO HAVE ANOTHER STI NO ONE WANTS IT AND ACTUALLY CLIENTS DON'T WANT TO GO HOME WITH A DRIP EITHER SO ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE ABLE TO ACHIEVE QUITE HIGH RATES OF CONDOM USE IN COMMERCIAL SEX
ElizabethPisani_2010@702.34:711.71 BUT IN INTIMATE RELATIONS IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE WITH YOUR WIFE OR YOUR BOYFRIEND OR SOMEONE THAT YOU HOPE MIGHT TURN INTO ONE OF THOSE THINGS
ElizabethPisani_2010@725.41:736.47 THAT YOU REALLY NEED QUITE A STRONG INCENTIVE TO USE CONDOMS THIS FOR EXAMPLE THIS GENTLEMAN 'S CALLED JOSEPH HE 'S FROM HAITI AND HE HAS AIDS
ElizabethPisani_2010@736.92:750.82 AND HE 'S PROBABLY NOT HAVING A LOT OF SEX RIGHT NOW BUT HE IS A REMINDER IN THE POPULATION OF WHY YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE USING CONDOMS THIS IS ALSO IN HAITI AND IS A REMINDER OF WHY YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE HAVING SEX PERHAPS
ElizabethPisani_2010@752.22:762.46 NOW FUNNILY ENOUGH THIS IS ALSO JOSEPH AFTER SIX MONTHS ON ANTIRETROVIRAL TREATMENT NOT FOR NOTHING DO WE CALL IT THE LAZARUS EFFECT
ElizabethPisani_2010@763.95:770.31 IS CHANGING THE EQUATION OF WHAT'S RATIONAL IN SEXUAL DECISION MAKING
ElizabethPisani_2010@771.91:782.73 SO WHAT WE'VE GOT SOME PEOPLE SAY OH IT DOESN'T MATTER VERY MUCH BECAUSE ACTUALLY TREATMENT IS EFFECTIVE PREVENTION BECAUSE IT LOWERS YOUR VIRAL LOAD AND THEREFORE MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO TRANSMIT HIV
ElizabethPisani_2010@783.16:790.28 SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE VIREMIA THING AGAIN IF YOU DO START TREATMENT WHEN YOU'RE SICK WELL WHAT HAPPENS YOUR VIRAL LOAD COMES DOWN
ElizabethPisani_2010@791.00:793.83 BUT COMPARED TO WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU'RE NOT ON TREATMENT
ElizabethPisani_2010@794.73:802.82 WELL YOU DIE SO YOUR VIRAL LOAD GOES TO ZERO AND ALL OF THIS GREEN STUFF HERE INCLUDING THE SPIKES WHICH ARE
ElizabethPisani_2010@803.32:811.58 BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T GET TO THE PHARMACY OR YOU RAN OUT OF DRUGS OR YOU WENT ON A THREE DAY PARTY BINGE AND FORGOT TO TAKE YOUR DRUGS OR BECAUSE YOU'VE STARTED TO GET
ElizabethPisani_2010@812.29:826.17 RESISTANCE OR WHATEVER ALL OF THAT IS VIRUS THAT WOULDN'T BE OUT THERE EXCEPT FOR TREATMENT NOW AM I SAYING OH WELL GREAT PREVENTION STRATEGY LET 'S JUST STOP TREATING PEOPLE OF COURSE NOT OF COURSE NOT WE NEED TO EXPAND
ElizabethPisani_2010@836.26:847.89 NOT NECESSARILY TRUE AND I THINK WE CAN LEARN A LOT FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF GAY MEN IN RICH COUNTRIES WHERE TREATMENT HAS BEEN WIDELY AVAILABLE FOR GOING ON FIFTEEN YEARS NOW AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT ACTUALLY
ElizabethPisani_2010@848.41:856.56 CONDOM USE RATES WHICH WERE VERY VERY HIGH THE GAY COMMUNITY RESPONDED VERY RAPIDLY TO HIV WITH EXTREMELY LITTLE HELP FROM PUBLIC HEALTH NERDS I WOULD SAY
ElizabethPisani_2010@857.95:867.69 THAT CONDOM USE RATE HAS COME DOWN DRAMATICALLY SINCE TREATMENT FOR TWO REASONS REALLY ONE IS THE ASSUMPTION OF OH WELL IF HE 'S INFECTED HE 'S PROBABLY ON MEDS AND HIS VIRAL LOAD 'S GOING TO BE LOW
ElizabethPisani_2010@868.03:873.74 SO I'M PRETTY SAFE AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY NOT AS SCARED OF
ElizabethPisani_2010@874.22:885.55 HIV AS THEY WERE OF AIDS AND RIGHTLY SO AIDS WAS A DISFIGURING DISEASE THAT KILLED YOU AND HIV IS AN INVISIBLE VIRUS THAT MAKES YOU TAKE A PILL EVERY DAY AND THAT'S BORING
ElizabethPisani_2010@886.15:895.17 IS IT AS BORING AS HAVING TO USE A CONDOM EVERY TIME YOU HAVE SEX NO MATTER HOW DRUNK YOU ARE NO MATTER HOW MANY POPPERS YOU'VE TAKEN WHATEVER
ElizabethPisani_2010@903.96:913.17 YOU SEE THE PEAK IN DRUG INJECTORS BEFORE THEY STARTED THE NATIONAL NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM THEN IT CAME WAY DOWN AND BOTH IN HETEROSEXUALS MOSTLY IN COMMERCIAL SEX AND IN DRUG USERS
ElizabethPisani_2010@913.92:919.89 GOT NOTHING MUCH GOING ON AFTER TREATMENT BEGINS AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THAT ALIGNMENT OF INCENTIVES THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER
ElizabethPisani_2010@920.44:930.64 BUT IN GAY MEN YOU'VE GOT QUITE A DRAMATIC RISE STARTING THREE OR FOUR YEARS AFTER TREATMENT BECAME WIDELY AVAILABLE THIS IS OF NEW INFECTIONS
ElizabethPisani_2010@930.99:946.83 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT MEANS THAT THE COMBINED EFFECT OF BEING LESS WORRIED AND HAVING MORE VIRUS OUT THERE IN THE POPULATION MORE PEOPLE LIVING LONGER HEALTHIER LIVES MORE LIKELY TO BE GETTING LAID WITH HIV IS OUTWEIGHING THE EFFECTS OF LOWER VIRAL
ElizabethPisani_2010@947.85:956.29 AND THAT'S A VERY WORRISOME THING WHAT DOES IT MEAN IT MEANS WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE PREVENTION THE MORE TREATMENT WE HAVE IS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING
ElizabethPisani_2010@956.72:964.66 NO AND I CALL IT THE COMPASSION CONUNDRUM WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT COMPASSION THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND WHAT'S HAPPENING REALLY IS THAT PEOPLE
ElizabethPisani_2010@965.52:973.82 UNABLE QUITE TO BRING THEMSELVES TO PUT IN GOOD SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES FOR SEX WORKERS UNABLE QUITE TO BE GIVING OUT NEEDLES TO JUNKIES
ElizabethPisani_2010@974.76:978.92 ONCE THEY'VE GONE FROM BEING TRANSGRESSIVE PEOPLE WHOSE BEHAVIORS WE DON'T WANT TO
ElizabethPisani_2010@979.64:988.94 TO BEING AIDS VICTIMS WE COME OVER ALL COMPASSIONATE AND BUY THEM INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE DRUGS FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH POINT OF VIEW
ElizabethPisani_2010@989.44:997.42 I WANT TO GIVE WHAT'S VERY NEARLY THE LAST WORD TO INES INES IS A A TRANSGENDER HOOKER ON THE STREETS OF JAKARTA SHE'S A CHICK
ElizabethPisani_2010@1010.22:1021.01 WHAT FACTORY WORKERS EARN IN AN HOUR IN INDONESIA ON AVERAGE TWENTY CENTS IT VARIES A BIT PROVINCE TO PROVINCE I DO SPEAK TO SEX WORKERS FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF THEM FOR THIS PARTICULAR SLIDE
ElizabethPisani_2010@1070.10:1076.66 I MEAN THE TRUTH IS THAT EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT RATIONALE THERE ARE AS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OF BEING RATIONAL AS THERE ARE HUMAN BEINGS ON THE PLANET
ElizabethPisani_2010@1085.90:1099.73 A DRUG INJECTOR TO SHARE NEEDLES BECAUSE OF A STUPID DECISION THAT'S MADE BY A POLITICIAN AND IT'S RATIONAL FOR A POLITICIAN TO MAKE THAT STUPID DECISION BECAUSE THEY'RE RESPONDING TO WHAT THEY THINK THE VOTERS WANT
ElizabethPisani_2010@1100.33:1114.32 'S THE THING WE ARE THE VOTERS WE'RE NOT ALL OF THEM OF COURSE BUT TED IS A COMMUNITY OF OPINION LEADERS AND EVERYONE WHO 'S IN THIS ROOM AND EVERYONE WHO 'S WATCHING THIS OUT THERE ON THE WEB I THINK HAS A DUTY TO DEMAND OF THEIR POLITICIANS
ElizabethPisani_2010@1125.22:1135.01 EVERY INES OUT THERE BUT YOU CAN AT LEAST USE YOUR VOTE TO STOP POLITICIANS DOING STUPID THINGS THAT SPREAD HIV THANK YOU
