GregStone_2010Z HAS TO START MAYBE BACK IN THE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WHEN I WAS SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS OLD WATCHING JACQUES COUSTEAU DOCUMENTARIES ON THE LIVING ROOM FLOOR WITH MY MASK AND FLIPPERS ON
GregStone_2010Z AFTER EVERY EPISODE I HAD TO GO UP TO THE BATHTUB AND SWIM AROUND THE BATHTUB AND LOOK AT THE DRAIN BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THERE WAS TO LOOK AT AND
GregStone_2010Z BY THE TIME I TURNED SIXTEEN I PURSUED A CAREER IN MARINE SCIENCE IN EXPLORATION AND DIVING
GregStone_2010Z AND LIVED IN UNDERWATER HABITATS LIKE THIS ONE OFF THE FLORIDA KEYS FOR THIRTY DAYS TOTAL BRIAN SKERRY TOOK THIS SHOT THANKS BRIAN
GregStone_2010Z AND I'VE DIVED IN DEEP SEA SUBMERSIBLES AROUND THE WORLD AND THIS ONE IS THE DEEPEST DIVING SUBMARINE IN THE WORLD OPERATED BY THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT
GregStone_2010Z AND SYLVIA EARLE AND I WERE ON AN EXPEDITION IN THIS SUBMARINE TWENTY YEARS AGO IN JAPAN AND ON MY DIVE I WENT DOWN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND
GregStone_2010Z TO AN AREA THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE PRISTINE WILDERNESS AREA ON THE SEA FLOOR BUT WHEN I GOT THERE I FOUND LOTS OF PLASTIC GARBAGE AND OTHER DEBRIS
GregStone_2010Z TEN YEARS AGO WAS A SEMINAL TRIP WHERE WE EXPLORED THAT BIG ICEBERG B FIFTEEN THE LARGEST ICEBERG IN HISTORY THAT BROKE OFF THE ROSS ICE SHELF
GregStone_2010Z AND WE DEVELOPED TECHNIQUES TO DIVE INSIDE AND UNDER THE ICEBERG SUCH AS HEATING PADS ON OUR KIDNEYS WITH A BATTERY THAT WE DRAGGED AROUND SO THAT
GregStone_2010Z AS THE BLOOD FLOWED THROUGH OUR KIDNEYS IT WOULD GET A LITTLE BOOST OF WARMTH BEFORE GOING BACK INTO OUR BODIES BUT AFTER THREE TRIPS TO ANTARCTICA I DECIDED THAT IT MIGHT BE NICER TO WORK IN WARMER WATER
GregStone_2010Z AND THAT SAME YEAR TEN YEARS AGO I HEADED NORTH TO THE PHOENIX ISLANDS AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THAT STORY HERE IN A MOMENT BUT BEFORE I DO I JUST WANT YOU TO PONDER THIS GRAPH FOR A MOMENT
GregStone_2010Z YOU MAY HAVE SEE THIS IN OTHER FORMS BUT THE TOP LINE IS THE AMOUNT OF PROTECTED AREA ON LAND GLOBALLY AND IT'S ABOUT TWELVE PERCENT AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT KIND OF HOCKEY STICKS UP AROUND THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES AND IT'S
GregStone_2010Z A NICE TRAJECTORY RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN EVERYBODY GOT AWARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND EARTH DAY
GregStone_2010Z AND ALL THE STUFF THAT HAPPENED IN THE SIXTIES WITH THE HIPPIES AND EVERYTHING REALLY DID I THINK HAVE AN AFFECT ON GLOBAL AWARENESS BUT THE OCEAN PROTECTED AREA IS BASICALLY FLAT
GregStone_2010Z ABOUT NOW IT APPEARS TO BE TICKING UP AND I DO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE AT THE HOCKEY STICK POINT OF THE PROTECTED AREA IN THE OCEAN I THINK WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THERE A LOT EARLIER IF WE COULD SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE OCEAN
GregStone_2010Z LIKE WE CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENS ON LAND BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE OCEAN IS OPAQUE AND WE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND THEREFORE WE'RE WAY BEHIND
GregStone_2010Z ON PROTECTION BUT SCUBA DIVING SUBMERSIBLES AND ALL THE WORK THAT WE'RE SETTING ABOUT TO DO HERE WILL HELP RECTIFY THAT
GregStone_2010Z SO WHERE ARE THE PHOENIX ISLANDS THEY WERE THE WORLD 'S LARGEST MARINE PROTECTED AREA UP UNTIL LAST WEEK WHEN THE CHAGOS ARCHIPELAGO WAS DECLARED IT'S IN THE MID PACIFIC IT'S ABOUT FIVE DAYS FROM ANYWHERE IF YOU WANT TO GET TO THE PHOENIX ISLANDS
GregStone_2010Z IT'S FIVE DAYS FROM FIJI IT'S FIVE DAYS FROM HAWAII IT'S FIVE DAYS FROM SAMOA IT'S OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC RIGHT AROUND THE EQUATOR
GregStone_2010Z I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE ISLANDS TEN YEARS AGO NOR THE COUNTRY KIRIBATI THAT OWNS THEM TIL TWO FRIENDS OF MINE WHO RUN A LIVEABOARD DIVE BOAT IN FIJI SAID GREG WOULD YOU LEAD A SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION UP TO THESE ISLANDS THEY'VE NEVER BEEN DIVED
GregStone_2010Z GIVE YOU A LITTLE PEEK HERE OF THE PHOENIX ISLANDS PROTECTED AREA IT'S A VERY DEEP WATER PART OF OUR PLANET THE AVERAGE DEPTHS ARE ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND FT THERE'S LOTS OF SEAMOUNTS IN THE PHOENIX ISLANDS WHICH ARE SPECIFICALLY PART OF THE PROTECTED AREA
GregStone_2010Z SEAMOUNTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR BIODIVERSITY THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE MOUNTAINS IN THE OCEAN THAN THERE ARE ON LAND IT'S AN INTERESTING FACT AND THE PHOENIX ISLANDS IS VERY RICH IN THOSE SEAMOUNTS
GregStone_2010Z SO IT'S A DEEP THINK ABOUT IT IN A BIG THREE DIMENSIONAL SPACE VERY DEEP THREE DIMENSIONAL SPACE WITH HERDS OF TUNA WHALES
GregStone_2010Z ALL KINDS OF DEEP SEA MARINE LIFE LIKE WE'VE SEEN HERE BEFORE THAT'S THE VESSEL THAT WE TOOK UP THERE FOR THESE STUDIES EARLY ON
GregStone_2010Z AND THAT'S WHAT THE ISLANDS LOOK LIKE YOU CAN SEE IN THE BACKGROUND THEY'RE VERY LOW TO THE WATER AND THEY'RE ALL UNINHABITED EXCEPT ONE ISLAND HAS ABOUT THIRTY FIVE CARETAKERS
GregStone_2010Z AND THEY'VE BEEN UNINHABITED FOR MOST OF TIME BECAUSE EVEN IN THE ANCIENT DAYS THESE ISLANDS WERE TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF FIJI AND HAWAII AND
GregStone_2010Z THE UNIQUE AND WONDERFUL SCIENTIFIC OPPORTUNITY AND PERSONAL OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO A PLACE THAT HAD NEVER BEEN DIVED AND JUST GET TO AN ISLAND AND GO OKAY WHERE ARE WE GOING TO
GregStone_2010Z LARGE FISH EVERYWHERE MANTA RAYS
GregStone_2010Z IT WAS AN ECOSYSTEM PARROTFISH SPAWNING THIS IS ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND LONGNOSE PARROTFISH SPAWNING AT THE ENTRANCE TO ONE OF THE PHOENIX ISLANDS YOU CAN SEE THIS FISH ARE BALLED UP AND THEN THERE'S A LITTLE CLOUDY AREA THERE WHERE THEY'RE EXCHANGING THE EGGS AND SPERM FOR REPRODUCTION
GregStone_2010Z THOUGHT THE SCENES OF NEVER ENDING WILDERNESS WOULD
GregStone_2010Z GO ON FOREVER BUT THEY DID FINALLY COME TO AN END AND WE
GregStone_2010Z SURFACE OF THE ISLANDS AS WELL VERY IMPORTANT BIRD NESTING SITE SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BIRD NESTING SITES IN THE PACIFIC
GregStone_2010Z IN THE WORLD AND WE FINISHED OUR
GregStone_2010Z THE AREA AGAIN YOU CAN SEE THE ISLANDS THERE'S EIGHT ISLANDS THAT POP OUT OF THE WATER THE
GregStone_2010Z THAT DON'T COME OUT OF THE WATER ARE THE SEAMOUNTS REMEMBER A SEAMOUNT TURNS INTO AN ISLAND WHEN IT HITS THE SURFACE
GregStone_2010Z AND WHAT'S THE CONTEXT OF THE PHOENIX ISLANDS WHERE DO THESE EXIST WELL THEY EXIST IN THE REPUBLIC OF KIRIBATI AND KIRIBATI IS LOCATED IN THE CENTRAL PACIFIC IN THREE ISLAND GROUPS
GregStone_2010Z IN THE WEST WE HAVE THE GILBERT ISLANDS IN THE CENTER WE HAVE THE PHOENIX ISLANDS WHICH IS THE SUBJECT THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT AND THEN OVER TO THE EAST WE HAVE THE LINE ISLANDS IT'S THE LARGEST ATOLL NATION IN THE WORLD
GregStone_2010Z AND THEY HAVE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE
GregStone_2010Z SPREAD OUT OVER THIRTY THREE ISLANDS THEY CONTROL THREE POINT FOUR MILLION CUBIC MILES OF OCEAN AND THAT'S
GregStone_2010Z BETWEEN ONE AND TWO PERCENT OF ALL THE OCEAN WATER ON THE PLANET AND WHEN I WAS FIRST GOING UP THERE I BARELY KNEW THE NAME OF THIS COUNTRY TEN YEARS AGO AND PEOPLE WOULD ASK ME
GregStone_2010Z WHY ARE YOU GOING TO THIS PLACE CALLED KIRIBATI AND IT REMINDED ME OF THAT OLD JOKE WHERE THE BANK ROBBER COMES OUT OF THE COURTHOUSE HANDCUFFED AND THE REPORTER YELLS HEY WILLY WHY DO YOU ROB BANKS AND HE SAYS CAUSE THAT'S WHERE ALL THE MONEY
GregStone_2010Z AND I WOULD TELL PEOPLE WHY DO I GO TO KIRIBATI BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE ALL THE OCEAN IS THEY BASICALLY ARE ONE NATION THAT CONTROLS MOST OF THE EQUATORIAL WATERS OF THE CENTRAL PACIFIC OCEAN
GregStone_2010Z ALSO A COUNTRY THAT IS IN DIRE DANGER
GregStone_2010Z SEA LEVELS ARE RISING
GregStone_2010Z AND KIRIBATI ALONG WITH FORTY TWO OTHER NATIONS IN THE WORLD WILL BE UNDER WATER WITHIN FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED YEARS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ASSOCIATED SEA LEVEL RISE FROM THERMAL EXPANSION AND THE MELTING OF FRESHWATER INTO THE OCEAN
GregStone_2010Z THE ISLANDS RISE ONLY ONE TO TWO METERS ABOVE THE SURFACE SOME OF THE ISLANDS HAVE ALREADY GONE UNDER WATER AND THESE NATIONS ARE FACED WITH A REAL PROBLEM WE AS A WORLD ARE FACED WITH A PROBLEM WHAT DO WE DO WITH DISPLACED FELLOW
GregStone_2010Z EARTHLINGS THAT NO LONGER HAVE A HOME ON THE PLANET THE PRESIDENT OF THE MALDIVES CONDUCTED A MOCK CABINET MEETING UNDERWATER RECENTLY
GregStone_2010Z TO HIGHLIGHT THE DIRE STRAITS OF THESE COUNTRIES SO IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO FOCUS ON BUT BACK TO THE PHOENIX ISLANDS WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS TALK
GregStone_2010Z SAID OKAY THIS IS AMAZING WHAT WE FOUND I'D LIKE TO GO BACK AND SHARE IT WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF KIRIBATI
GregStone_2010Z WHO ARE OVER IN TARAWA THE WESTERNMOST GROUP SO I STARTED CONTACTING THEM BECAUSE THEY HAD ACTUALLY GIVEN ME A PERMIT TO DO THIS AND
GregStone_2010Z I SAID I WANT TO COME UP AND TELL YOU WHAT WE FOUND AND FOR SOME REASON THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO COME OR IT WAS HARD TO FIND A TIME AND A PLACE AND IT TOOK AWHILE BUT FINALLY THEY SAID OKAY YOU CAN
GregStone_2010Z IF YOU COME YOU HAVE TO BUY LUNCH FOR EVERYBODY WHO COMES TO THE SEMINAR
GregStone_2010Z SO I SAID OKAY I'M HAPPY TO BUY LUNCH JUST GET WHATEVER ANYBODY WANTS SO DAVID OBURA A CORAL REEF BIOLOGIST AND I WENT TO TARAWA AND WE PRESENTED FOR TWO HOURS ON THE AMAZING FINDINGS OF THE PHOENIX ISLANDS AND
GregStone_2010Z THE COUNTRY NEVER KNEW THIS THEY NEVER HAD ANY DATA FROM THIS AREA THEY'D NEVER HAD ANY INFORMATION FROM THE PHOENIX ISLANDS AFTER THE TALK THE MINISTER OF FISHERIES
GregStone_2010Z WE OFTEN ISSUE THESE PERMITS TO DO RESEARCH IN OUR WATERS BUT USUALLY WE GET A NOTE TWO OR THREE YEARS LATER OR A REPRINT BUT YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE THAT'S EVER COME BACK AND TOLD US WHAT YOU DID AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND WE'RE BUYING YOU LUNCH TODAY AND ARE YOU FREE FOR DINNER
GregStone_2010Z GAINS WHAT REVENUE IS HAS BY SELLING ACCESS TO FOREIGN NATIONS TO TAKE FISH OUT OF ITS WATERS BECAUSE KIRIBATI DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TAKE THE FISH ITSELF
GregStone_2010Z AND THE DEAL THAT THEY STRIKE IS THE EXTRACTING COUNTRY GIVES KIRIBATI FIVE PERCENT OF THE LANDED VALUE
GregStone_2010Z SO IF THE UNITED STATES REMOVES A MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF
GregStone_2010Z FIFTY THOUSAND
GregStone_2010Z AND YOU KNOW IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE A VERY GOOD DEAL TO ME
GregStone_2010Z SO I ASKED THE MINISTER OVER DINNER I SAID WOULD YOU CONSIDER
GregStone_2010Z A SITUATION WHERE YOU WOULD STILL GET PAID WE DO THE MATH AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE VALUE OF THE RESOURCE IS BUT YOU LEAVE FISH AND THE SHARKS AND THE
GregStone_2010Z HE STOPPED AND HE SAID YES WE WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT
GregStone_2010Z TO DEAL WITH OUR OVERFISHING PROBLEM
GregStone_2010Z AND I THINK WE WOULD CALL IT A REVERSE FISHING LICENSE HE COINED THE TERM REVERSE FISHING LICENSE SO I SAID YES A REVERSE FISHING LICENSE SO
GregStone_2010Z WE WALKED AWAY FROM THIS DINNER REALLY NOT KNOWING WHERE TO GO AT THAT POINT I WENT BACK TO THE STATES AND STARTED LOOKING AROUND TO SEE IF I COULD FIND EXAMPLES WHERE
GregStone_2010Z IT HAD OCCURRED ON LAND IN RAINFORESTS OF SOUTH AMERICA AND AFRICA WHERE LANDOWNERS HAD BEEN PAID NOT TO CUT THE TREES
GregStone_2010Z VALUING THE FISHERY RESOURCE
GregStone_2010Z AND WE BASICALLY FOUNDED THE PARK ON THE IDEA OF AN ENDOWMENT THAT WOULD PAY THE EQUIVALENT LOST FISHING LICENSE FEES TO THIS VERY POOR COUNTRY TO KEEP THE AREA INTACT
GregStone_2010Z IS REMEMBER I'M A POLITICIAN SO YOU'VE GO OUT AND WORK WITH MY MINISTERS AND CONVINCE THE PEOPLE OF KIRIBATI THAT THIS IS A GOOD IDEA
GregStone_2010Z I DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IF IT'S GOING TO GO AWAY AFTER I'M VOTED OUT OF OFFICE
GregStone_2010Z IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO WHEN THIS WAS ALL GOING FULL SWING
GregStone_2010Z A CORAL BLEACHING EVENT HAPPENED
GregStone_2010Z HERE 'S THIS RESOURCE THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO SAVE AND
GregStone_2010Z IT TURNS OUT IT'S THE HOTTEST HEATING EVENT THAT WE CAN FIND ON RECORD
GregStone_2010Z THE OCEAN HEATED UP AS IT DOES SOMETIMES AND THE HOT SPOT FORMED AND STALLED RIGHT OVER THE PHOENIX ISLANDS FOR SIX MONTHS
GregStone_2010Z IT WAS OVER THIRTY TWO DEGREES CELSIUS FOR SIX MONTHS AND IT BASICALLY KILLED SIXTY PERCENT OF THE CORAL
GregStone_2010Z SO SUDDENLY WE HAD THIS AREA THAT WE WERE PROTECTING BUT NOW IT APPEARED TO BE DEAD AT LEAST IN THE CORAL AREAS OF COURSE THE DEEP SEA AREAS AND THE OPEN OCEAN AREAS WERE FINE BUT THE CORAL WHICH EVERYBODY LIKES TO LOOK AT WAS IN TROUBLE WELL THE GOOD NEWS IS
GregStone_2010Z KEEP THE ALGAE GRAZED DOWN AND KEEP THE REST OF THE REEF HEALTHY THE CORAL IS BOOMING IS JUST BOOMING BACK IT'S ALMOST LIKE IF A PERSON HAS MULTIPLE DISEASES
GregStone_2010Z IT'S HARD TO GET WELL YOU MIGHT DIE BUT IF YOU ONLY HAVE ONE DISEASE TO DEAL WITH
GregStone_2010Z YOU CAN GET BETTER AND THAT'S THE STORY WITH CLIMATE CHANGE HEATING IT'S THE ONLY THREAT THE ONLY INFLUENCE THAT THE REEF HAD TO DEAL WITH THERE WAS NO FISHING THERE WAS NO POLLUTION THERE WAS NO COASTAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE REEF IS ON A FULL BORE RECOVERY
GregStone_2010Z NOW I REMEMBER THAT DINNER I HAD WITH THE MINISTER OF FISHERIES TEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE FIRST BROUGHT THIS UP AND I GOT QUITE ANIMATED DURING THE DINNER AND SAID WELL I THINK THAT THE CONSERVATION COMMUNITY MIGHT EMBRACE THIS IDEA MINISTER HE PAUSED AND PUT HIS HANDS TOGETHER AND SAID YES GREG
GregStone_2010Z BUT THE DEVIL WILL BE IN THE DETAILS
GregStone_2010Z AND IT CERTAINLY WAS THE LAST TEN YEARS HAVE BEEN DETAIL AFTER DETAIL RANGING FROM
GregStone_2010Z CREATING LEGISLATION TO MULTIPLE RESEARCH EXPEDITIONS TO COMMUNICATION PLANS
GregStone_2010Z AS I SAID TEAMS OF LAWYERS
GregStone_2010Z CREATING THE PHOENIX ISLANDS TRUST BOARD AND WE ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS OF RAISING THE FULL ENDOWMENT KIRIBATI HAS FROZEN EXTRACTING ACTIVITIES AT ITS CURRENT STATE
GregStone_2010Z WHILE WE RAISE THE ENDOWMENT WE JUST HAD OUR FIRST PIPA TRUST BOARD MEETING THREE WEEKS AGO SO IT'S A FULLY FUNCTIONAL UP AND RUNNING ENTITY THAT NEGOTIATES THE REVERSE FISHING LICENSE WITH THE COUNTRY
GregStone_2010Z AND THE PIPA TRUST BOARD HOLDS THAT LICENSE AND PAYS THE COUNTRY FOR THIS SO IT'S A VERY SOLID VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT VERY WELL GROUNDED SYSTEM
GregStone_2010Z AND IT WAS A BOTTOM UP SYSTEM AND THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT WITH THIS WORK FROM THE BOTTOM UP TO SECURE THIS
GregStone_2010Z SO THE CONDITIONS FOR SUCCESS HERE ARE LISTED YOU CAN READ THEM YOURSELVES BUT I WOULD SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IN MY MIND WAS WORKING WITHIN THE MARKET FORCES OF THE SITUATION
GregStone_2010Z BOTH THE SELF INTEREST OF KIRIBATI
GregStone_2010Z AS WELL AS THE SELF INTEREST OF THE WORLD AND I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH ONE FINAL SLIDE
GregStone_2010Z THAT IS HOW DO WE SCALE THIS UP HOW DO WE REALIZE SYLVIA 'S DREAM WHERE EVENTUALLY DO WE TAKE THIS HERE 'S THE PACIFIC
GregStone_2010Z WITH LARGE MPA 'S AND
GregStone_2010Z LARGE CONSERVATION ZONES ON IT
GregStone_2010Z AND AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE A PATCHWORK ACROSS THIS OCEAN
GregStone_2010Z I'VE JUST DESCRIBED TO YOU THE ONE STORY BEHIND THAT RECTANGULAR AREA IN THE MIDDLE THE PHOENIX ISLANDS BUT EVERY OTHER GREEN PATCH ON THAT HAS ITS OWN STORY
GregStone_2010Z AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW IS LOOK AT THE WHOLE PACIFIC OCEAN
