EleanorLongden_2013 I LOOKED AROUND AND THERE WAS NO ONE THERE BUT THE CLARITY AND DECISIVENESS OF THE COMMENT WAS UNMISTAKABLE SHAKEN I LEFT MY BOOKS ON THE STAIRS AND HURRIED HOME AND THERE IT WAS AGAIN SHE IS OPENING THE DOOR THIS WAS THE BEGINNING
EleanorLongden_2013 THE VOICE HAD ARRIVED AND THE VOICE PERSISTED DAYS AND THEN WEEKS OF IT ON AND ON NARRATING EVERYTHING I DID IN THE THIRD PERSON SHE IS GOING TO THE LIBRARY SHE IS GOING TO A LECTURE
EleanorLongden_2013 IT WAS NEUTRAL IMPASSIVE AND EVEN AFTER A WHILE STRANGELY COMPANIONATE AND REASSURING ALTHOUGH I DID NOTICE THAT ITS CALM EXTERIOR SOMETIMES SLIPPED
EleanorLongden_2013 AND THAT IT OCCASIONALLY MIRRORED MY OWN UNEXPRESSED EMOTION SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I WAS ANGRY AND HAD TO HIDE IT WHICH I OFTEN DID BEING VERY ADEPT AT CONCEALING HOW I REALLY FELT THEN THE VOICE WOULD SOUND FRUSTRATED
EleanorLongden_2013 OTHERWISE IT WAS NEITHER SINISTER NOR DISTURBING ALTHOUGH EVEN AT THAT POINT IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT HAD SOMETHING TO COMMUNICATE TO ME ABOUT MY EMOTIONS PARTICULARLY EMOTIONS WHICH WERE REMOTE AND INACCESSIBLE
EleanorLongden_2013 AND WAS MET WITH BORED INDIFFERENCE UNTIL I MENTIONED THE VOICE UPON WHICH HE DROPPED HIS PEN SWUNG ROUND AND BEGAN TO QUESTION ME WITH A SHOW OF REAL INTEREST AND TO BE FAIR I WAS DESPERATE FOR INTEREST AND HELP AND I BEGAN TO TELL HIM ABOUT MY STRANGE COMMENTATOR AND I ALWAYS WISH AT THIS POINT THE VOICE HAD SAID SHE IS DIGGING HER OWN GRAVE
EleanorLongden_2013 FOR EXAMPLE I WAS PART OF A STUDENT TV STATION THAT BROADCAST NEWS BULLETINS AROUND THE CAMPUS AND DURING AN APPOINTMENT WHICH WAS RUNNING VERY LATE I SAID I 'M SORRY DOCTOR I 'VE GOT TO GO I 'M READING THE NEWS AT SIX NOW IT 'S DOWN ON MY MEDICAL RECORDS THAT ELEANOR HAS DELUSIONS THAT SHE 'S A TELEVISION NEWS BROADCASTER
EleanorLongden_2013 IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT EVENTS BEGAN TO RAPIDLY OVERTAKE ME A HOSPITAL ADMISSION FOLLOWED THE FIRST OF MANY A DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA CAME NEXT
EleanorLongden_2013 AND THEN WORST OF ALL A TOXIC TORMENTING SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS HUMILIATION AND DESPAIR ABOUT MYSELF AND MY PROSPECTS
EleanorLongden_2013 BUT HAVING BEEN ENCOURAGED TO SEE THE VOICE NOT AS AN EXPERIENCE BUT AS A SYMPTOM MY FEAR AND RESISTANCE TOWARDS IT INTENSIFIED NOW ESSENTIALLY THIS REPRESENTED TAKING AN AGGRESSIVE STANCE TOWARDS MY OWN MIND A KIND OF PSYCHIC CIVIL WAR
EleanorLongden_2013 AND IN TURN THIS CAUSED THE NUMBER OF VOICES TO INCREASE AND GROW PROGRESSIVELY HOSTILE AND MENACING
EleanorLongden_2013 HELPLESSLY AND HOPELESSLY I BEGAN TO RETREAT INTO THIS NIGHTMARISH INNER WORLD IN WHICH THE VOICES WERE DESTINED TO BECOME BOTH MY PERSECUTORS AND MY ONLY PERCEIVED COMPANIONS
EleanorLongden_2013 THEY TOLD ME FOR EXAMPLE THAT IF I PROVED MYSELF WORTHY OF THEIR HELP THEN THEY COULD CHANGE MY LIFE BACK TO HOW IT HAD BEEN AND A SERIES OF INCREASINGLY BIZARRE TASKS WAS SET A KIND OF LABOR OF HERCULES
EleanorLongden_2013 TWO YEARS LATER AND THE DETERIORATION WAS DRAMATIC
EleanorLongden_2013 BY NOW I HAD THE WHOLE FRENZIED REPERTOIRE TERRIFYING VOICES GROTESQUE VISIONS BIZARRE INTRACTABLE DELUSIONS
EleanorLongden_2013 MY MENTAL HEALTH STATUS HAD BEEN A CATALYST FOR DISCRIMINATION VERBAL ABUSE AND PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ASSAULT AND I 'D BEEN TOLD BY MY PSYCHIATRIST ELEANOR YOU 'D BE BETTER OFF WITH CANCER BECAUSE CANCER IS EASIER TO CURE THAN SCHIZOPHRENIA
EleanorLongden_2013 I 'D BEEN DIAGNOSED DRUGGED AND DISCARDED AND WAS BY NOW SO TORMENTED BY THE VOICES THAT I ATTEMPTED TO DRILL A HOLE IN MY HEAD IN ORDER TO GET THEM OUT
EleanorLongden_2013 NOW LOOKING BACK ON THE WRECKAGE AND DESPAIR OF THOSE YEARS IT SEEMS TO ME NOW AS IF SOMEONE DIED IN THAT PLACE AND YET SOMEONE ELSE WAS SAVED
EleanorLongden_2013 A BROKEN AND HAUNTED PERSON BEGAN THAT JOURNEY BUT THE PERSON WHO EMERGED WAS A SURVIVOR AND WOULD ULTIMATELY GROW INTO THE PERSON I WAS DESTINED TO BE
EleanorLongden_2013 MANY PEOPLE HAVE HARMED ME IN MY LIFE AND I REMEMBER THEM ALL
EleanorLongden_2013 BUT THE MEMORIES GROW PALE AND FAINT IN COMPARISON WITH THE PEOPLE WHO 'VE HELPED ME
EleanorLongden_2013 THE FELLOW SURVIVORS THE FELLOW VOICE HEARERS THE COMRADES AND COLLABORATORS
EleanorLongden_2013 THE MOTHER WHO NEVER GAVE UP ON ME WHO KNEW THAT ONE DAY I WOULD COME BACK TO HER AND WAS WILLING TO WAIT FOR ME FOR AS LONG AS IT TOOK
EleanorLongden_2013 BUT TOGETHER THEY FORGED A BLEND OF COURAGE CREATIVITY INTEGRITY AND AN UNSHAKEABLE BELIEF THAT MY SHATTERED SELF COULD BECOME HEALED AND WHOLE I USED TO SAY THAT THESE PEOPLE SAVED ME BUT WHAT I NOW KNOW IS THEY DID SOMETHING EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IN THAT THEY EMPOWERED ME TO SAVE MYSELF
EleanorLongden_2013 AND CRUCIALLY THEY HELPED ME TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING WHICH I 'D ALWAYS SUSPECTED THAT MY VOICES WERE A MEANINGFUL RESPONSE TO TRAUMATIC LIFE EVENTS PARTICULARLY CHILDHOOD EVENTS AND AS SUCH WERE NOT MY ENEMIES BUT A SOURCE OF INSIGHT INTO SOLVABLE EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS
EleanorLongden_2013 NOW AT FIRST THIS WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE NOT LEAST BECAUSE THE VOICES APPEARED SO HOSTILE AND MENACING
EleanorLongden_2013 SO IN THIS RESPECT A VITAL FIRST STEP WAS LEARNING TO SEPARATE OUT A METAPHORICAL MEANING FROM WHAT I 'D PREVIOUSLY INTERPRETED TO BE A LITERAL TRUTH SO FOR EXAMPLE VOICES WHICH THREATENED TO ATTACK MY HOME I LEARNED TO INTERPRET AS MY OWN SENSE OF FEAR AND INSECURITY IN THE WORLD RATHER THAN AN ACTUAL OBJECTIVE DANGER
EleanorLongden_2013 NOW AT FIRST I WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THEM I REMEMBER FOR EXAMPLE SITTING UP ONE NIGHT ON GUARD OUTSIDE MY PARENTS ROOM TO PROTECT THEM FROM WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A GENUINE THREAT FROM THE VOICES
EleanorLongden_2013 BECAUSE I 'D HAD SUCH A BAD PROBLEM WITH SELF INJURY THAT MOST OF THE CUTLERY IN THE HOUSE HAD BEEN HIDDEN SO I ENDED UP ARMING MYSELF WITH A PLASTIC FORK KIND OF LIKE PICNIC WARE AND SORT OF SAT OUTSIDE THE ROOM CLUTCHING IT AND WAITING TO
EleanorLongden_2013 SO WHEN THE VOICES WARNED ME NOT TO LEAVE THE HOUSE THEN I WOULD THANK THEM FOR DRAWING MY ATTENTION TO HOW UNSAFE I FELT BECAUSE IF I WAS AWARE OF IT THEN I COULD DO SOMETHING POSITIVE ABOUT IT BUT GO ON TO REASSURE BOTH THEM AND MYSELF THAT WE WERE SAFE AND DIDN 'T NEED TO FEEL FRIGHTENED ANYMORE
EleanorLongden_2013 I WOULD SET BOUNDARIES FOR THE VOICES AND TRY TO INTERACT WITH THEM IN A WAY THAT WAS ASSERTIVE YET RESPECTFUL ESTABLISHING A SLOW PROCESS OF COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION IN WHICH WE COULD LEARN TO WORK TOGETHER AND SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER
EleanorLongden_2013 THROUGHOUT ALL OF THIS WHAT I WOULD ULTIMATELY REALIZE WAS THAT EACH VOICE WAS CLOSELY RELATED TO ASPECTS OF MYSELF AND THAT EACH OF THEM CARRIED OVERWHELMING EMOTIONS THAT I 'D NEVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROCESS OR RESOLVE MEMORIES OF SEXUAL TRAUMA AND ABUSE OF ANGER SHAME GUILT LOW SELF WORTH
EleanorLongden_2013 THE VOICES TOOK THE PLACE OF THIS PAIN AND GAVE WORDS TO IT
EleanorLongden_2013 TEN YEARS AFTER THE VOICE FIRST CAME I FINALLY GRADUATED THIS TIME WITH THE HIGHEST DEGREE IN PSYCHOLOGY THE UNIVERSITY HAD EVER GIVEN AND ONE YEAR LATER THE HIGHEST MASTERS WHICH SHALL WE SAY ISN 'T BAD FOR A MADWOMAN IN FACT ONE OF THE VOICES ACTUALLY DICTATED THE ANSWERS DURING THE EXAM WHICH TECHNICALLY POSSIBLY COUNTS AS CHEATING
EleanorLongden_2013 IT ALSO MAKES YOU VERY GOOD AT EAVESDROPPING BECAUSE YOU CAN LISTEN TO TWO CONVERSATIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY SO IT 'S NOT ALL BAD I WORKED IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES I SPOKE AT CONFERENCES I PUBLISHED BOOK CHAPTERS AND ACADEMIC ARTICLES AND I ARGUED AND CONTINUE TO DO SO THE RELEVANCE OF THE FOLLOWING CONCEPT
EleanorLongden_2013 AND I REMEMBER THE MOST MOVING AND EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT WHEN SUPPORTING ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS TERRORIZED BY HER VOICES AND BECOMING FULLY AWARE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT I NO LONGER FELT THAT WAY MYSELF
EleanorLongden_2013 BUT WAS FINALLY ABLE TO HELP SOMEONE ELSE WHO WAS
EleanorLongden_2013 BUT A COMPLEX SIGNIFICANT AND MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCE TO BE EXPLORED
EleanorLongden_2013 TOGETHER WE ENVISAGE AND ENACT A SOCIETY THAT UNDERSTANDS AND RESPECTS VOICE HEARING SUPPORTS THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HEAR VOICES AND WHICH VALUES THEM AS FULL CITIZENS THIS TYPE OF SOCIETY IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE IT 'S ALREADY ON ITS WAY
EleanorLongden_2013 TO PARAPHRASE CHAVEZ ONCE SOCIAL CHANGE BEGINS IT CANNOT BE REVERSED YOU CANNOT HUMILIATE THE PERSON WHO FEELS PRIDE YOU CANNOT OPPRESS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AFRAID ANYMORE
EleanorLongden_2013 AND THAT BELIEFS CAN CHANGE THE WORLD
EleanorLongden_2013 IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THE HEARING VOICES MOVEMENT HAS ESTABLISHED HEARING VOICES NETWORKS IN TWENTY SIX COUNTRIES ACROSS FIVE CONTINENTS WORKING TOGETHER TO PROMOTE DIGNITY SOLIDARITY AND EMPOWERMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS IN MENTAL DISTRESS
EleanorLongden_2013 TO CREATE A NEW LANGUAGE AND PRACTICE OF HOPE WHICH AT ITS VERY CENTER LIES AN UNSHAKABLE BELIEF IN THE POWER OF THE INDIVIDUAL
EleanorLongden_2013 AND THE INTELLECTUAL SPIRIT TO HARNESS THIS INNATE CAPACITY
EleanorLongden_2013 IN THIS RESPECT FOR MEMBERS OF SOCIETY THERE IS NO GREATER HONOR OR PRIVILEGE THAN FACILITATING THAT PROCESS OF HEALING FOR SOMEONE TO BEAR WITNESS TO REACH OUT A HAND TO SHARE THE BURDEN OF SOMEONE 'S SUFFERING AND TO HOLD THE HOPE FOR THEIR RECOVERY AND LIKEWISE FOR SURVIVORS OF DISTRESS AND ADVERSITY THAT WE REMEMBER
EleanorLongden_2013 WE DON 'T HAVE TO LIVE OUR LIVES FOREVER DEFINED BY THE DAMAGING THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO US WE ARE UNIQUE WE ARE IRREPLACEABLE WHAT LIES WITHIN US CAN NEVER BE TRULY COLONIZED CONTORTED OR TAKEN AWAY
EleanorLongden_2013 THE LIGHT NEVER GOES OUT
