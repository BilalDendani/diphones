KarenTse_2011G@18.11:22.53 I WALKED INTO A PRISON IN CAMBODIA AND I MET A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY
KarenTse_2011G@22.76:26.21 WHO HAD BEEN TORTURED AND WAS DENIED ACCESS TO COUNSEL
KarenTse_2011G@26.81:45.17 AND AS I LOOKED INTO HIS EYES I REALIZED THAT FOR THE HUNDREDS OF LETTERS I HAD WRITTEN FOR POLITICAL PRISONERS THAT I WOULD NEVER HAVE WRITTEN A LETTER FOR HIM BECAUSE HE WAS NOT A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY WHO HAD DONE SOMETHING IMPORTANT FOR ANYBODY HE WAS NOT A POLITICAL PRISONER HE WAS A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY WHO HAD STOLEN A BICYCLE
KarenTse_2011G@72.09:85.13 WE OFTEN THINK OF TORTURE AS BEING POLITICAL TORTURE OR RESERVED FOR JUST THE WORST BUT IN FACT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF TORTURE TODAY IS NOT FOR POLITICAL PRISONERS IT IS FOR PEOPLE
KarenTse_2011G@85.27:99.14 WHO ARE IN BROKEN DOWN LEGAL SYSTEMS AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE TORTURE IS THE CHEAPEST FORM OF INVESTIGATION IT 'S CHEAPER THAN HAVING A LEGAL SYSTEM CHEAPER THAN HAVING A LAWYER AND EARLY ACCESS TO COUNSEL IT IS WHAT HAPPENS MOST OF THE TIME
KarenTse_2011G@99.73:103.57 I BELIEVE TODAY THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR US AS A WORLD COMMUNITY
KarenTse_2011G@109.43:111.51 BUT IT WILL REQUIRE THREE THINGS
KarenTse_2011G@111.76:116.81 FIRST IS THE TRAINING EMPOWERMENT AND CONNECTION OF DEFENDERS WORLDWIDE
KarenTse_2011G@117.07:122.71 THE SECOND IS INSURING THAT THERE IS SYSTEMATIC EARLY ACCESS TO COUNSEL
KarenTse_2011G@123.18:125.96 AND THE THIRD IS COMMITMENT
KarenTse_2011G@137.67:140.44 AND I FOUNDED INTERNATIONAL BRIDGES TO JUSTICE
KarenTse_2011G@140.51:144.69 WHICH HAS A SPECIFIC MISSION OF ENDING TORTURE AS AN INVESTIGATIVE TOOL
KarenTse_2011G@167.32:185.75 AND EVEN TWENTY YEARS LATER THERE WAS ONLY TEN LAWYERS IN THE COUNTRY SO CONSEQUENTLY YOU 'D WALK INTO A PRISON AND NOT ONLY WOULD YOU MEET TWELVE YEAR OLD BOYS YOU 'D MEET WOMEN AND YOU 'D SAY WHY ARE YOU HERE WOMEN WOULD SAY WELL I 'VE BEEN HERE FOR TEN YEARS BECAUSE MY HUSBAND COMMITTED A CRIME BUT THEY CAN 'T FIND HIM SO IT 'S JUST A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS NO RULE OF LAW
KarenTse_2011G@185.89:203.82 THE FIRST GROUP OF DEFENDERS CAME TOGETHER AND I STILL REMEMBER AS I WAS TRAINING I SAID OKAY WHAT DO YOU DO FOR AN INVESTIGATION AND THERE WAS SILENCE IN THE CLASS AND FINALLY ONE WOMAN STOOD UP INAUDIBLE NAME AND SHE SAID KHREW WHICH MEANS TEACHER SHE SAID I HAVE DEFENDED MORE THAN A HUNDRED PEOPLE
KarenTse_2011G@231.46:236.64 AND I STILL REMEMBER THE FIRST CASES WHERE THEY CAME ALL TWENTY FIVE TOGETHER SHE WOULD STAND UP AND THEY WERE IN THE BACK
KarenTse_2011G@236.65:251.76 AND THEY WOULD SUPPORT HER AND THE JUDGES KEPT SAYING NO NO NO NO WE 'RE GOING TO DO THINGS THE EXACT SAME WAY WE 'VE BEEN DOING THEM BUT ONE DAY THE PERFECT CASE CAME AND IT WAS A WOMAN WHO WAS A VEGETABLE SELLER SHE WAS SITTING OUTSIDE OF A HOUSE SHE SAID SHE ACTUALLY SAW THE PERSON
KarenTse_2011G@273.49:279.96 BEGAN TO TAKE CASES OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND YOU WILL SEE THEY HAVE STEP BY STEP BEGAN
KarenTse_2011G@287.87:294.48 IT OTHER COUNTRIES BUT IT IS IN SO MANY COUNTRIES IN BURUNDI I WALKED INTO A PRISON AND IT WASN 'T
KarenTse_2011G@314.27:316.73 PRISON DIRECTOR I SAID
KarenTse_2011G@321.97:323.51 EIGHTY PERCENT
KarenTse_2011G@341.61:353.58 IT WAS THAT INAUDIBLE NAME DID NOT GO ALONE BUT SHE HAD TWENTY FOUR LAWYERS WITH HER WHO STOOD UP TOGETHER AND IN THE SAME WAY IN CHINA THEY ALWAYS TELL ME IT 'S LIKE A FRESH WIND IN THE DESERT WHEN WE CAN COME TOGETHER
KarenTse_2011G@353.67:366.99 OR IN ZIMBABWE WHERE I REMEMBER INNOCENT AFTER COMING OUT OF A PRISON WHERE EVERYBODY STOOD UP AND SAID I 'VE BEEN HERE FOR ONE YEAR EIGHT YEARS TWELVE YEARS WITHOUT A LAWYER HE CAME AND WE HAD A TRAINING TOGETHER AND HE SAID
KarenTse_2011G@379.44:398.77 AND THEN HE SAID BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THE LACK OF RESOURCES IS NEVER AN EXCUSE FOR INJUSTICE AND WITH THAT HE SUCCESSFULLY ORGANIZED SIXTY EIGHT LAWYERS WHO HAVE BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY TAKING THE CASES THE KEY THAT WE SEE THOUGH IS TRAINING AND THEN EARLY ACCESS I WAS RECENTLY IN EGYPT
KarenTse_2011G@398.77:412.11 AND WAS INSPIRED TO MEET WITH ANOTHER GROUP OF LAWYERS AND WHAT THEY TOLD ME IS THAT THEY SAID HEY LOOK WE DON 'T HAVE POLICE ON THE STREETS NOW THE POLICE ARE ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY WE HAD THE REVOLUTION THEY WERE TORTURING EVERYBODY ALL THE TIME
KarenTse_2011G@459.51:470.28 IMPLEMENT EARLY ACCESS TO COUNSEL BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SAFEGUARD IN THE SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING TORTURED AND AS I TELL YOU THIS I 'M ALSO AWARE OF THE FACT THAT
KarenTse_2011G@470.28:475.63 IT SOUNDS LIKE OH OKAY IT SOUNDS LIKE WE COULD DO IT BUT CAN WE REALLY DO IT
KarenTse_2011G@476.07:483.33 AND THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY I BELIEVE IT 'S POSSIBLE THE FIRST REASON IS THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND
KarenTse_2011G@529.85:543.57 THESE JUSTICEMAKERS BUT PEOPLE WE COURAGEOUSLY SEE FIGURE OUT WHO THEIR NETWORKS ARE AND HOW THEY CAN MOVE IT FORWARD SO IN CHINA FOR INSTANCE GREAT LAWS CAME OUT WHERE IT SAYS POLICE
KarenTse_2011G@565.88:583.55 HE ORGANIZED THREE THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE YOUTH COMMUNIST LEAGUE FROM FOURTEEN OF THE TOP LAW SCHOOLS WHO ORGANIZED THEMSELVES DEVELOPED POSTERS WITH THE NEW LAWS AND WENT TO THE POLICE STATIONS AND BEGAN WHAT HE SAYS IS A NON VIOLENT LEGAL REVOLUTION TO PROTECT CITIZEN RIGHTS
KarenTse_2011G@585:602.73 SO I TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO TRAIN AND SUPPORT DEFENDERS WE NEED TO SYSTEMATICALLY IMPLEMENT EARLY ACCESS TO COUNSEL BUT THE THIRD AND MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE MAKE A COMMITMENT TO THIS AND PEOPLE OFTEN SAY TO ME YOU KNOW THIS IS GREAT BUT IT 'S WILDLY IDEALISTIC NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN
KarenTse_2011G@612.16:624.68 IT BEGAN WITH A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO DECIDED THEY WOULD COMMIT NOW THERE 'S ONE OF OUR FAVORITE POEMS FROM THE DEFENDERS WHICH THEY SHARE FROM EACH OTHER IS TAKE COURAGE FRIENDS THE ROAD IS OFTEN LONG
