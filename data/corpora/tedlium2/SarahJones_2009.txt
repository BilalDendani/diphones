SarahJones_2009 FOR EXAMPLE A FRIEND OF MINE
SarahJones_2009 AND I WANTED TO START BY TELLING YOU THAT ONCE SARAH JONES TOLD ME THAT WE WILL BE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME HERE TO TED IN CALIFORNIA
SarahJones_2009 I WAS VERY PLEASED AND FRANKLY RELIEVED BECAUSE YOU KNOW I AM A HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATE AND USUALLY MY WORK IT TAKES ME TO WASHINGTON D C
SarahJones_2009 AND THERE I MUST ATTEND THESE MEETINGS MINGLING WITH SOME TIRESOME POLITICIANS TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL COMFORTABLE BY TELLING HOW OFTEN THEY ARE EATING THE CURRY IN GEORGETOWN SO YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE RIGHT
SarahJones_2009 BUT I'M THRILLED TO BE JOINING ALL OF YOU HERE I WISH WE HAD MORE TIME TOGETHER BUT THAT'S FOR ANOTHER TIME
SarahJones_2009 AND SADLY I DON'T THINK WE'LL HAVE TIME FOR YOU TO MEET EVERYBODY I BROUGHT BUT
SarahJones_2009 TO BEHAVE MYSELF IT'S MY FIRST TIME
SarahJones_2009 BUT I DO WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO A COUPLE OF FOLKS YOU MAY RECOGNIZE IF YOU SAW BRIDGE AND TUNNEL
SarahJones_2009 WELL THANK YOU GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS PAULINE NING AND
SarahJones_2009 I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT I'M OF COURSE I AM A MEMBER OF THE CHINESE COMMUNITY IN NEW YORK
SarahJones_2009 WHEN SARAH JONES ASKED ME TO PLEASE COME TO TED I SAID WELL YOU KNOW FIRST I DON'T KNOW
SarahJones_2009 THAT YOU KNOW BEFORE TWO YEARS AGO YOU WOULD NOT FIND ME IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE OF PEOPLE MUCH LESS LIKE THIS BECAUSE I DID NOT LIKE TO GIVE SPEECHES BECAUSE I FEEL THAT AS AN IMMIGRANT I DO NOT HAVE
SarahJones_2009 GOOD ENGLISH SKILLS FOR SPEAKING BUT THEN I DECIDED JUST LIKE GOVERNOR ARNOLD SCHWARTZENEGGER I TRY ANYWAY
SarahJones_2009 MY DAUGHTER MY DAUGHTER WROTE THAT SHE TOLD ME ALWAYS START YOUR SPEECH WITH HUMOR BUT MY BACKGROUND
SarahJones_2009 I WANT TO TELL YOU STORY ONLY BRIEFLY MY HUSBAND AND I WE BROUGHT OUR SON AND DAUGHTER HERE IN NINETEEN EIGHTIES
SarahJones_2009 TO HAVE THE FREEDOM WE CANNOT HAVE IN CHINA AT THAT TIME AND WE TRIED TO TEACH OUR KIDS TO BE PROUD OF THEIR TRADITION BUT IT'S VERY
SarahJones_2009 AS IMMIGRANT I WOULD SPEAK CHINESE TO THEM AND THEY WOULD ALWAYS ANSWER ME BACK IN ENGLISH
SarahJones_2009 THEY LOVE ROCK MUSIC POP CULTURE AMERICAN CULTURE BUT WHEN THEY GOT OLDER
SarahJones_2009 WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR THEM TO START THINK ABOUT GETTING MARRIED THAT'S WHEN WE EXPECT THEM TO REALIZE A LITTLE BIT MORE THEIR OWN CULTURE
SarahJones_2009 THAT'S WHERE WE HAD SOME PROBLEMS MY SON HE SAYS HE IS NOT READY TO GET MARRIED AND HE HAS A SWEETHEART
SarahJones_2009 BUT SHE IS AMERICAN WOMAN NOT CHINESE IT'S NOT THAT IT'S BAD BUT I TOLD HIM WHAT 'S WRONG WITH A CHINESE WOMAN
SarahJones_2009 BUT I THINK HE WILL CHANGE HIS MIND SOON SO THEN I DECIDE INSTEAD I WILL CONCENTRATE ON MY DAUGHTER
SarahJones_2009 THE DAUGHTER 'S MARRIAGE IS VERY SPECIAL TO THE MOM BUT FIRST SHE SAID SHE'S NOT INTERESTED SHE ONLY WANTS TO SPEND TIME WITH HER FRIENDS AND THEN
SarahJones_2009 AT COLLEGE IT'S LIKE SHE NEVER CAME HOME AND SHE DOESN'T WANT ME TO COME AND VISIT SO I SAID WHAT 'S WRONG IN THIS PICTURE
SarahJones_2009 SO I ACCUSED MY DAUGHTER TO HAVE LIKE A SECRET BOYFRIEND BUT SHE TOLD ME MOM YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BOYS BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THEM
SarahJones_2009 AND I SAID YES MEN CAN BE DIFFICULT BUT ALL WOMEN HAVE TO GET USED TO THAT SHE SAID NO MOM I MEAN I DON'T LIKE BOYS I LIKE GIRLS I AM
SarahJones_2009 SO I ALWAYS TEACH MY KIDS TO RESPECT AMERICAN IDEAS BUT I TOLD MY DAUGHTER THAT THIS IS ONE EXCEPTION
SarahJones_2009 IS NOT GAY SHE IS JUST CONFUSED BY THIS AMERICAN PROBLEM
SarahJones_2009 BUT SHE TOLD ME MOM IT'S NOT AMERICAN SHE SAID SHE IS IN LOVE IN LOVE WITH A NICE CHINESE GIRL
SarahJones_2009 SO THESE ARE THE WORDS I AM WAITING TO HEAR BUT FROM MY SON NOT MY
SarahJones_2009 I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO BUT THEN OVER TIME I HAVE COME TO UNDERSTAND
SarahJones_2009 THIS IS WHO SHE IS SO EVEN THOUGH SOMETIMES IT'S STILL
SarahJones_2009 WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT IT HELPS ME TO REALIZE SOCIETY IS MORE TOLERANT
SarahJones_2009 SO I THINK MAYBE TED YOU IMPACT PEOPLE 'S LIVES IN THE WAYS THAT MAYBE EVEN YOU DON'T REALIZE
SarahJones_2009 FOR MY DAUGHTER 'S SAKE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR IDEAS WORTH SPREADING THANK YOU
SarahJones_2009 GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS HABBI BELAHAL AND I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST OF ALL THANK SARAH JONES FOR PUTTING ALL OF THE PRESSURE ON THE ONLY ARAB WHO SHE BROUGHT
SarahJones_2009 TO BE LAST TODAY I AM ORIGINALLY FROM JORDAN AND I TEACH COMPARATIVE LITERATURE AT QUEENS COLLEGE
SarahJones_2009 IT IS NOT HARVARD BUT I FEEL A BIT LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER BUT
SarahJones_2009 I AM VERY PROUD OF MY STUDENTS AND I SEE THAT A FEW OF THEM DID MAKE IT HERE TO THE CONFERENCE SO YOU WILL GET THE EXTRA CREDIT I
SarahJones_2009 I KNOW THAT I MAY NOT LOOK LIKE THE TYPICAL DENIZEN AS YOU WOULD SAY I DO LIKE TO MAKE THE POINT THAT
SarahJones_2009 WE IN GLOBAL SOCIETY WE ARE NEVER AS DIFFERENT AS THE APPEARANCES MAY SUGGEST SO IF YOU WILL INDULGE ME I WILL SHARE
SarahJones_2009 QUICKLY WITH YOU A BIT OF VERSE WHICH I MEMORIZED AS A YOUNG GIRL AT SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE SO BACK IN THE ANCIENT TIMES

SarahJones_2009 BECAUSE I WAS AT THE SAME TIME IN MY LIFE LISTENING TO THE
SarahJones_2009 ON THE RADIO THEY WERE VERY POPULAR SO ALL OF THAT IS TO SAY THAT I LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT FOR EVERY
SarahJones_2009 TO ONE ANOTHER THERE IS ALWAYS A LYRIC CONNECTING EARS AND HEARTS ACROSS THE CONTINENTS IN RHYME
SarahJones_2009 AND I PRAY THAT THIS IS THE WAY THAT WE WILL SELF INVENT IN TIME THAT'S ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OKAY
