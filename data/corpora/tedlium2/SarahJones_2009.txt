SarahJones_2009@796.09:803.78 WHEN SARAH JONES ASKED ME TO PLEASE COME TO TED I SAID WELL YOU KNOW FIRST I DON'T KNOW
SarahJones_2009@805.11:818.68 THAT YOU KNOW BEFORE TWO YEARS AGO YOU WOULD NOT FIND ME IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE OF PEOPLE MUCH LESS LIKE THIS BECAUSE I DID NOT LIKE TO GIVE SPEECHES BECAUSE I FEEL THAT AS AN IMMIGRANT I DO NOT HAVE
SarahJones_2009@819.59:828.29 GOOD ENGLISH SKILLS FOR SPEAKING BUT THEN I DECIDED JUST LIKE GOVERNOR ARNOLD SCHWARTZENEGGER I TRY ANYWAY
SarahJones_2009@833.43:840.16 MY DAUGHTER MY DAUGHTER WROTE THAT SHE TOLD ME ALWAYS START YOUR SPEECH WITH HUMOR BUT MY BACKGROUND

SarahJones_2009@848.77:858.42 TO HAVE THE FREEDOM WE CANNOT HAVE IN CHINA AT THAT TIME AND WE TRIED TO TEACH OUR KIDS TO BE PROUD OF THEIR TRADITION BUT IT'S VERY
SarahJones_2009@859.34:865.14 AS IMMIGRANT I WOULD SPEAK CHINESE TO THEM AND THEY WOULD ALWAYS ANSWER ME BACK IN ENGLISH
SarahJones_2009@865.91:871.71 THEY LOVE ROCK MUSIC POP CULTURE AMERICAN CULTURE BUT WHEN THEY GOT OLDER
SarahJones_2009@872.03:880.73 WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR THEM TO START THINK ABOUT GETTING MARRIED THAT'S WHEN WE EXPECT THEM TO REALIZE A LITTLE BIT MORE THEIR OWN CULTURE
SarahJones_2009@881.99:889.41 THAT'S WHERE WE HAD SOME PROBLEMS MY SON HE SAYS HE IS NOT READY TO GET MARRIED AND HE HAS A SWEETHEART
SarahJones_2009@889.61:897.85 BUT SHE IS AMERICAN WOMAN NOT CHINESE IT'S NOT THAT IT'S BAD BUT I TOLD HIM WHAT 'S WRONG WITH A CHINESE WOMAN
SarahJones_2009@899.22:906.86 BUT I THINK HE WILL CHANGE HIS MIND SOON SO THEN I DECIDE INSTEAD I WILL CONCENTRATE ON MY DAUGHTER
SarahJones_2009@907.86:918.61 THE DAUGHTER 'S MARRIAGE IS VERY SPECIAL TO THE MOM BUT FIRST SHE SAID SHE'S NOT INTERESTED SHE ONLY WANTS TO SPEND TIME WITH HER FRIENDS AND THEN
SarahJones_2009@919.04:927.39 AT COLLEGE IT'S LIKE SHE NEVER CAME HOME AND SHE DOESN'T WANT ME TO COME AND VISIT SO I SAID WHAT 'S WRONG IN THIS PICTURE

SarahJones_2009@974.82:983.63 BUT SHE TOLD ME MOM IT'S NOT AMERICAN SHE SAID SHE IS IN LOVE IN LOVE WITH A NICE CHINESE GIRL
SarahJones_2009@985.87:990.16 SO THESE ARE THE WORDS I AM WAITING TO HEAR BUT FROM MY SON NOT MY
SarahJones_2009@996.22:1000.88 I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO BUT THEN OVER TIME I HAVE COME TO UNDERSTAND
