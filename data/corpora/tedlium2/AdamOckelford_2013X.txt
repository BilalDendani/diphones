AdamOckelford_2013X@22.83:37.35 IT 'S AMAZING NOW BECAUSE HE 'S SO MUCH BIGGER THAN ME BUT WHEN DEREK WAS BORN HE COULD HAVE FITTED ON THE PALM OF YOUR HAND HE WAS BORN THREE AND A HALF MONTHS PREMATURE AND REALLY IT WAS A FANTASTIC FIGHT FOR HIM TO SURVIVE
AdamOckelford_2013X@45.45:58.65 BUT THAT WAS THE END OF THE BAD NEWS BECAUSE WHEN DEREK CAME HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL HIS FAMILY DECIDED TO EMPLOY THE REDOUBTABLE NANNY WHO WAS GOING TO LOOK AFTER YOU DEREK REALLY FOR THE REST OF YOUR CHILDHOOD
AdamOckelford_2013X@58.65:62.41 AND NANNY 'S GREAT INSIGHT REALLY WAS TO THINK
AdamOckelford_2013X@62.41:81 HERE 'S A CHILD WHO CAN 'T SEE MUSIC MUST BE THE THING FOR DEREK AND SURE ENOUGH SHE SANG OR AS DEREK CALLED IT WARBLED TO HIM FOR HIS FIRST FEW YEARS OF LIFE AND I THINK IT WAS THAT EXCITEMENT WITH HEARING HER VOICE HOUR AFTER HOUR EVERY DAY THAT
AdamOckelford_2013X@86.48:93.7 GIFT HERE 'S A LITTLE PICTURE OF DEREK GOING UP NOW WHEN YOU WERE WITH YOUR NANNY
AdamOckelford_2013X@93.7:99.26 NOW NANNY 'S GREAT OTHER INSIGHT WAS TO THINK PERHAPS WE SHOULD GET DEREK
AdamOckelford_2013X@99.26:116.08 SOMETHING TO PLAY AND SURE ENOUGH SHE DRAGGED THIS LITTLE KEYBOARD OUT OF THE LOFT NEVER THINKING REALLY THAT ANYTHING MUCH WOULD COME OF IT BUT DEREK YOUR TINY HAND MUST HAVE GONE OUT TO THAT THING AND ACTUALLY BASHED IT BASHED IT SO HARD THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BREAK
AdamOckelford_2013X@116.08:123.55 BUT OUT OF ALL THE BASHING AFTER A FEW MONTHS EMERGED THE MOST FANTASTIC MUSIC
AdamOckelford_2013X@225.38:240.66 HAS NO ONE IN THE FAMILY WHO PLAYS AN INSTRUMENT AND YET HE TAUGHT HIMSELF TO PLAY THAT AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE PICTURE THERE WAS QUITE A LOT OF BODY ACTION GOING ON WHILE YOU WERE PLAYING DEREK NOW ALONG DEREK AND I MET WHEN HE WAS FOUR AND A HALF YEARS OLD
AdamOckelford_2013X@256.03:269.03 AND HAVING SAID TO YOUR DAD NICK THAT I WOULD TRY TO TEACH YOU I WAS THEN SLIGHTLY CONFUSED AS TO HOW I MIGHT GO ABOUT THAT IF I WASN 'T ALLOWED NEAR THE PIANO BUT AFTER A WHILE I THOUGHT WELL THE ONLY WAY IS TO JUST PICK YOU UP
AdamOckelford_2013X@310.22:323.78 AN EXCITING JOURNEY REALLY AND IN THOSE DAYS DEREK YOU DIDN 'T SPEAK VERY MUCH AND SO THERE WAS ALWAYS A MOMENT OF TENSION AS TO WHETHER YOU 'D ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WAS WE WERE GOING TO PLAY AND WHETHER YOU 'D PLAY THE RIGHT PIECE IN THE RIGHT KEY AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING
AdamOckelford_2013X@323.78:333.51 BUT THE ORCHESTRA WERE WOWED AS WELL AND THE PRESS OF THE WORLD WERE FASCINATED BY YOUR ABILITY TO PLAY THESE FANTASTIC PIECES
AdamOckelford_2013X@333.51:342.57 NOW THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU DO IT DEREK AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN SHOW THE AUDIENCE NOW HOW IT IS YOU DO WHAT YOU DO
AdamOckelford_2013X@368.64:373.94 SOME PEOPLE HAVE PERFECT PITCH FOR A FEW WHITE NOTES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PIANO
AdamOckelford_2013X@440.24:452.55 THAT KIND OF RAW ABILITY WITHOUT THE TECHNIQUE AND LUCKILY DEREK YOU DECIDED THAT ONCE WE DID START LEARNING YOU 'D LET ME HELP YOU LEARN ALL THE SCALE FINGERINGS SO FOR EXAMPLE USING YOUR THUMB UNDER WITH C MAJOR

AdamOckelford_2013X@618.03:635.17 SORRY DO YOU MIND PLAYING FLIGHT OF THE BUMBLEE IN B MINOR INSTEAD OF A MINOR AS WE WENT ON IN FACT THE FIRST TIME DEREK YOU PLAYED THAT WITH AN ORCHESTRA YOU 'D LEARNED THE VERSION THAT YOU 'D LEARNED AND THEN THE ORCHESTRA IN FACT DID HAVE A DIFFERENT VERSION SO WHILE WE WERE WAITING IN THE TWO HOURS BEFORE THE REHEARSAL AND THE CONCERT
AdamOckelford_2013X@815.93:819.92 YOU MAY THINK THIRTEEN HOURS IS A LONG TIME TO KEEP TALKING BUT DEREK DOES IT EFFORTLESSLY
