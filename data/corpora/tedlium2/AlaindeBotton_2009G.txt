AlaindeBotton_2009G@14.15:23.33 THESE CAREER CRISES OFTEN ACTUALLY ON A SUNDAY EVENING JUST AS THE SUN IS STARTING TO SET AND THE GAP BETWEEN MY HOPES FOR MYSELF AND THE REALITY
AlaindeBotton_2009G@23.56:30.57 OF MY LIFE START TO DIVERGE SO PAINFULLY THAT I NORMALLY END UP WEEPING INTO A PILLOW I'M MENTIONING ALL THIS
AlaindeBotton_2009G@31.01:42.81 I'M MENTIONING ALL THIS BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS NOT MERELY A PERSONAL PROBLEM YOU MAY THINK I'M WRONG IN THIS BUT I THINK THAT WE LIVE IN AN AGE WHEN OUR LIVES ARE REGULARLY PUNCTUATED BY CAREER CRISES BY MOMENTS WHEN WHAT WE THOUGHT WE KNEW
AlaindeBotton_2009G@43.14:50.70 ABOUT OUR LIVES ABOUT OUR CAREERS COMES INTO CONTACT WITH A THREATENING SORT OF REALITY IT'S PERHAPS EASIER NOW THAN EVER BEFORE
AlaindeBotton_2009G@50.81:57.89 TO MAKE A GOOD LIVING IT'S PERHAPS HARDER THAN EVER BEFORE TO STAY CALM TO BE FREE OF CAREER ANXIETY I WANT TO LOOK
AlaindeBotton_2009G@58.65:67.04 NOW IF I MAY AT SOME OF THE REASONS WHY WE MIGHT BE FEELING ANXIETY ABOUT OUR CAREERS WHY WE MIGHT BE VICTIMS OF THESE CAREER CRISES AS
AlaindeBotton_2009G@67.34:75.93 WE'RE WEEPING SOFTLY INTO OUR PILLOWS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE MIGHT BE SUFFERING IS THAT WE ARE SURROUNDED BY SNOBS
AlaindeBotton_2009G@101.41:109.33 AND USES THAT TO COME TO A COMPLETE VISION OF WHO YOU ARE THAT IS SNOBBERY AND THE DOMINANT KIND OF SNOBBERY THAT EXISTS NOWADAYS
AlaindeBotton_2009G@109.85:118.47 JOB SNOBBERY YOU ENCOUNTER IT WITHIN MINUTES AT A PARTY WHEN YOU GET ASKED THAT FAMOUS ICONIC QUESTION OF THE EARLY TWENTY ONE ST CENTURY WHAT DO YOU DO
AlaindeBotton_2009G@118.86:128.82 AND ACCORDING TO HOW YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION PEOPLE ARE EITHER INCREDIBLY DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU OR LOOK AT THEIR WATCH AND MAKE THEIR EXCUSES NOW TO OPPOSITE OF A SNOB IS YOUR MOTHER
AlaindeBotton_2009G@129.98:139.40 NOT NECESSARILY YOUR MOTHER OR INDEED MINE BUT AS IT WERE THE IDEAL MOTHER SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS BUT UNFORTUNATELY MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT OUR MOTHERS
AlaindeBotton_2009G@146.88:155.90 LOVE IN GENERAL RESPECT THEY ARE WILLING TO ACCORD US THAT WILL BE STRICTLY DEFINED BY OUR POSITION IN THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY AND THAT'S A LOT OF THE REASON WHY WE CARE SO MUCH ABOUT OUR CAREERS
AlaindeBotton_2009G@156.19:163.74 AND INDEED START CARING SO MUCH ABOUT MATERIAL GOODS YOU KNOW WE'RE OFTEN TOLD THAT WE LIVE IN VERY MATERIALISTIC TIMES
AlaindeBotton_2009G@164.50:172.60 GREEDY PEOPLE I DON'T THINK WE ARE PARTICULARLY MATERIALISTIC I THINK WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHICH HAS SIMPLY PEGGED CERTAIN EMOTIONAL REWARDS TO
AlaindeBotton_2009G@172.79:186.28 THE ACQUISITION OF MATERIAL GOODS IT'S NOT THE MATERIAL GOODS WE WANT IT'S THE REWARDS WE WANT AND THAT'S A NEW WAY OF LOOKING AT LUXURY GOODS THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE SOMEBODY DRIVING A FERRARI DON'T THINK THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO IS GREEDY THINK THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO IS INCREDIBLY VULNERABLE AND IN NEED OF LOVE
AlaindeBotton_2009G@191.66:197.61 FEEL SYMPATHY RATHER THAN CONTEMPT THERE ARE OTHER REASONS THERE ARE OTHER REASONS WHY
AlaindeBotton_2009G@212.23:222.29 FROM MANY SOURCES THAT ANYONE CAN ACHIEVE ANYTHING WE'VE DONE AWAY WITH THE CASTE SYSTEM WE ARE NOW IN A SYSTEM WHERE ANYONE CAN RISE TO ANY POSITION THEY PLEASE AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL IDEA
AlaindeBotton_2009G@223.13:235.26 ALONG WITH THAT IS A KIND OF SPIRIT OF EQUALITY WE'RE ALL BASICALLY EQUAL THERE ARE NO STRICTLY DEFINED KIND OF HIERARCHIES THERE IS ONE REALLY BIG PROBLEM WITH THIS AND THAT PROBLEM IS ENVY ENVY
AlaindeBotton_2009G@235.77:244.32 REAL TABOO TO MENTION ENVY BUT IF THERE IS ONE DOMINANT EMOTION IN MODERN SOCIETY THAT IS ENVY AND IT'S LINKED TO THE SPIRIT OF EQUALITY LET ME EXPLAIN
AlaindeBotton_2009G@244.62:256.46 I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY UNUSUAL FOR ANYONE HERE OR ANYONE WATCHING TO BE ENVIOUS OF THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND EVEN THOUGH SHE IS MUCH RICHER THAN ANY OF YOU ARE AND SHE'S GOT A VERY LARGE HOUSE THE REASON WHY WE DON'T ENVY
AlaindeBotton_2009G@265.50:279.78 WE CAN'T RELATE TO HER AND WHEN YOU CAN'T RELATE TO SOMEBODY YOU DON'T ENVY THEM THE CLOSER TWO PEOPLE ARE IN AGE IN BACKGROUND IN THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFICATION THE MORE THERE IS A DANGER OF ENVY WHICH IS INCIDENTALLY WHY NONE OF YOU SHOULD EVER GO TO A SCHOOL REUNION BECAUSE THERE IS NO
AlaindeBotton_2009G@280.39:288.77 STRONGER REFERENCE POINT THAN PEOPLE ONE WAS AT SCHOOL WITH BUT THE PROBLEM GENERALLY OF MODERN SOCIETY IS THAT IT TURNS THE WHOLE WORLD INTO A SCHOOL EVERYBODY IS WEARING JEANS EVERYBODY IS THE SAME
AlaindeBotton_2009G@288.99:297.36 AND YET THEY'RE NOT SO THERE IS A SPIRIT OF EQUALITY COMBINED WITH DEEP INEQUALITIES WHICH MAKES FOR A VERY CAN MAKE FOR A VERY STRESSFUL SITUATION IT'S PROBABLY AS UNLIKELY
AlaindeBotton_2009G@297.84:305.45 THAT YOU WOULD NOWADAYS BECOME AS RICH AND FAMOUS AS BILL GATES AS IT WAS UNLIKELY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THAT YOU WOULD ACCEDE TO THE RANKS OF THE FRENCH ARISTOCRACY
AlaindeBotton_2009G@305.67:315.13 BUT THE POINT IS IT DOESN'T FEEL THAT WAY IT'S MADE TO FEEL BY MAGAZINES AND OTHER MEDIA OUTLETS THAT IF YOU'VE GOT ENERGY A FEW BRIGHT IDEAS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY A GARAGE YOU
AlaindeBotton_2009G@330.49:341.78 THE FIRST KIND TELLS YOU YOU CAN DO IT YOU CAN MAKE IT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE AND THE OTHER KIND TELL YOU HOW TO COPE WITH WHAT WE POLITELY CALL LOW SELF ESTEEM OR IMPOLITELY CALL FEELING VERY BAD ABOUT YOURSELF
AlaindeBotton_2009G@342.24:354.10 A REAL CORRELATIONSHIP A REAL CORRELATION BETWEEN A SOCIETY THAT TELLS PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN DO ANYTHING AND THE EXISTENCE OF LOW SELF ESTEEM SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH SOMETHING THAT IS QUITE POSITIVE CAN HAVE A NASTY KICKBACK THERE IS ANOTHER REASON
AlaindeBotton_2009G@354.63:364.63 WHY WE MIGHT BE FEELING MORE ANXIOUS ABOUT OUR CAREERS ABOUT OUR STATUS IN THE WORLD TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE AND IT IS AGAIN LINKED TO SOMETHING NICE AND THAT NICE THING IS CALLED MERITOCRACY
AlaindeBotton_2009G@365.16:373.59 NOW EVERYBODY ALL POLITICIANS ON LEFT AND RIGHT AGREE THAT MERITOCRACY IS A GREAT THING AND WE SHOULD ALL BE TRYING TO MAKE OUR SOCIETIES REALLY REALLY MERITOCRATIC
AlaindeBotton_2009G@396.87:409.29 TO GET TO THE BOTTOM ALSO GET TO THE BOTTOM AND STAY THERE IN OTHER WORDS YOUR POSITION IN LIFE COMES TO SEEM NOT ACCIDENTAL BUT MERITED AND DESERVED AND THAT MAKES FAILURE SEEM MUCH MORE CRUSHING YOU KNOW IN THE MIDDLE AGES
AlaindeBotton_2009G@410.15:419.05 IN ENGLAND WHEN YOU MET A VERY POOR PERSON THAT PERSON WOULD BE DESCRIBED AS AN UNFORTUNATE LITERALLY SOMEBODY WHO HAD NOT BEEN BLESSED BY FORTUNE AN UNFORTUNATE
AlaindeBotton_2009G@426.63:432.43 A REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN UNFORTUNATE AND A LOSER AND THAT SHOWS FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF EVOLUTION IN SOCIETY AND
AlaindeBotton_2009G@432.67:444.39 OUR BELIEF IN WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR LIVES IT'S NO LONGER THE GODS IT'S US WE'RE IN THE DRIVING SEAT THAT'S EXHILARATING IF YOU'RE DOING WELL AND VERY CRUSHING IF YOU'RE NOT IT LEADS IN THE WORST CASES IN THE ANALYSIS OF
AlaindeBotton_2009G@444.58:453.71 A SOCIOLOGIST LIKE EMIL DURKHEIM IT LEADS TO INCREASED RATES OF SUICIDE THERE ARE MORE SUICIDES IN DEVELOPED INDIVIDUALISTIC COUNTRIES THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD
AlaindeBotton_2009G@453.93:460.31 AND SOME OF THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT PEOPLE TAKE WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM EXTREMELY PERSONALLY THE OWN THEIR SUCCESS BUT THEY ALSO
AlaindeBotton_2009G@461.25:472.99 THEIR FAILURE IS THERE ANY RELIEF FROM SOME OF THESE PRESSURES THAT I'VE JUST BEEN OUTLINING I THINK THERE IS I JUST WANT TO TURN TO A FEW OF THEM LET 'S TAKE MERITOCRACY THIS IDEA THAT EVERYBODY DESERVES TO GET WHERE THEY GET TO
AlaindeBotton_2009G@473.86:482.03 I THINK IT'S A CRAZY IDEA COMPLETELY CRAZY I WILL SUPPORT ANY POLITICIAN OF LEFT AND RIGHT WITH ANY HALFWAY DECENT MERITOCRATIC IDEA I AM A MERITOCRAT IN THAT SENSE
AlaindeBotton_2009G@482.35:491.04 BUT I THINK IT'S INSANE TO BELIEVE THAT WE WILL EVER MAKE A SOCIETY THAT IS GENUINELY MERITOCRATIC IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM THE IDEA THAT WE WILL MAKE A SOCIETY WHERE LITERALLY EVERYBODY
AlaindeBotton_2009G@491.83:505.21 THE GOOD AT THE TOP AND THE BAD AT THE BOTTOM AND IT'S EXACTLY DONE AS IT SHOULD BE IS IMPOSSIBLE THERE ARE SIMPLY TOO MANY RANDOM FACTORS ACCIDENTS ACCIDENTS OF BIRTH ACCIDENTS OF THINGS DROPPING ON PEOPLE 'S HEADS ILLNESSES ETC WE WILL NEVER GET TO GRADE THEM
AlaindeBotton_2009G@515.11:522.28 IN MODERN ENGLISH THAT WOULD MEAN IT'S A SIN TO COME TO ANY VIEW OF WHO YOU SHOULD TALK TO DEPENDENT ON THEIR BUSINESS CARD IT'S NOT THE POST THAT SHOULD COUNT
AlaindeBotton_2009G@522.90:535.92 AND ACCORDING TO ST AUGUSTINE IT'S ONLY GOD WHO CAN REALLY PUT EVERYBODY IN THEIR PLACE AND HE 'S GOING TO DO THAT ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT WITH ANGELS AND TRUMPETS AND THE SKIES WILL OPEN INSANE IDEA IF YOU'RE A SECULARIST PERSON LIKE ME BUT SOMETHING VERY VALUABLE IN THAT IDEA NEVERTHELESS
AlaindeBotton_2009G@536.20:546.78 IN OTHER WORDS HOLD YOUR HORSES WHEN YOU'RE COMING TO JUDGE PEOPLE YOU DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT SOMEONE 'S TRUE VALUE IS THAT IS AN UNKNOWN PART OF THEM AND WE SHOULDN 'T BEHAVE AS THOUGH IT IS
AlaindeBotton_2009G@557.40:567.06 WHAT WE FEAR IS THE JUDGEMENT AND RIDICULE OF OTHERS AND IT EXISTS YOU KNOW THE NUMBER ONE ORGAN OF RIDICULE NOWADAYS IS THE NEWSPAPER AND IF YOU OPEN THE NEWSPAPER ANY DAY OF THE WEEK
AlaindeBotton_2009G@567.42:575.77 IT'S FULL OF PEOPLE WHO 'VE MESSED UP THEIR LIVES THEY'VE SLEPT WITH THE WRONG PERSON THEY'VE TAKEN THE WRONG SUBSTANCE THEY'VE PASSED THE WRONG LEGISLATION WHATEVER IT IS AND THEN ARE FIT FOR
AlaindeBotton_2009G@586.84:596.77 TRAGIC ART AS IT DEVELOPED IN THE THEATERS OF ANCIENT GREECE IN THE FIFTH CENTURY B C WAS ESSENTIALLY AN ART FORM DEVOTED TO TRACING HOW PEOPLE FAIL AND
AlaindeBotton_2009G@597.75:611.30 ALSO ACCORDING THEM A LEVEL OF SYMPATHY WHICH ORDINARY LIFE WOULD NOT NECESSARILY ACCORD THEM I REMEMBER A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS THINKING ABOUT ALL THIS AND I WENT TO SEE THE SUNDAY SPORT A TABLOID NEWSPAPER THAT I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU TO START READING IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT ALREADY
AlaindeBotton_2009G@612.23:619.73 I WENT TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT CERTAIN OF THE GREAT TRAGEDIES OF WESTERN ART AND I WANTED TO SEE HOW THEY WOULD SEIZE THE BARE BONES OF CERTAIN STORIES
AlaindeBotton_2009G@620.05:626.92 IF THEY CAME IN AS A NEWS ITEM AT THE NEWS DESK ON A SATURDAY AFTERNOON SO I TOLD THEM ABOUT OTHELLO THEY HAD NOT HEARD OF IT BUT WERE FASCINATED BY
AlaindeBotton_2009G@628.16:634.52 TO WRITE THE HEADLINE FOR THE STORY OF OTHELLO THEY CAME UP WITH LOVE CRAZED IMMIGRANT KILLS SENATORS DAUGHTER SPLASHED
AlaindeBotton_2009G@635.36:644.14 I GAVE THEM THE PLOTLINE OF MADAME BOVARY AGAIN A BOOK THEY WERE ENCHANTED TO DISCOVER AND THEY WROTE SHOPAHOLIC ADULTERESS SWALLOWS ARSENIC AFTER CREDIT
AlaindeBotton_2009G@645.47:654.12 THEN MY FAVORITE THEY REALLY DO HAVE A KIND OF GENIUS ALL OF THEIR OWN THESE GUYS MY FAVORITE IS SOPHOCLES OEDIPUS THE KING SEX WITH MUM WAS BLINDING
AlaindeBotton_2009G@660.09:674.49 LIKE AT ONE END OF THE SPECTRUM OF SYMPATHY YOU'VE GOT THE TABLOID NEWSPAPER AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM YOU'VE GOT TRAGEDY AND TRAGIC ART AND I SUPPOSE I'M ARGUING THAT WE SHOULD LEARN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TRAGIC ART IT WOULD BE INSANE TO CALL HAMLET A LOSER
AlaindeBotton_2009G@674.71:686.00 HE IS NOT A LOSER THOUGH HE HAS LOST AND I THINK THAT IS THE MESSAGE OF TRAGEDY TO US AND WHY IT'S SO VERY VERY IMPORTANT I THINK THE OTHER THING ABOUT MODERN SOCIETY AND WHY IT CAUSES THIS ANXIETY
AlaindeBotton_2009G@686.34:697.33 IS THAT WE HAVE NOTHING AT ITS CENTER THAT IS NON HUMAN WE ARE THE FIRST SOCIETY TO BE LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE WE DON'T WORSHIP ANYTHING OTHER THAN OURSELVES WE THINK VERY HIGHLY OF OURSELVES AND SO WE SHOULD WE'VE PUT PEOPLE ON THE MOON
AlaindeBotton_2009G@697.89:702.27 OF EXTRAORDINARY THINGS AND SO WE TEND TO WORSHIP OURSELVES OUR HEROS ARE HUMAN
AlaindeBotton_2009G@703.47:710.08 THAT'S A VERY NEW SITUATION MOST OTHER SOCIETIES HAVE HAD RIGHT AT THEIR CENTER THE WORSHIP OF SOMETHING TRANSCENDENT A GOD A SPIRIT
AlaindeBotton_2009G@710.18:718.58 A NATURAL FORCE THE UNIVERSE WHATEVER IT IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS BEING WORSHIPED WE'VE SLIGHTLY LOST THE HABIT OF DOING THAT WHICH IS I THINK WHY WE'RE PARTICULARLY DRAWN TO NATURE
AlaindeBotton_2009G@719.22:732.64 NOT FOR THE SAKE OF OUR HEALTH THOUGH IT'S OFTEN PRESENTED THAT WAY BUT BECAUSE IT'S AN ESCAPE FROM THE HUMAN ANTHILL IT'S AN ESCAPE FROM OUR OWN COMPETITION AND OUR OWN DRAMAS AND THAT'S WHY WE ENJOY LOOKING AT GLACIERS AND OCEANS AND CONTEMPLATING THE
AlaindeBotton_2009G@732.96:740.55 FROM OUTSIDE ITS PERIMETERS ETC WE LIKE TO FEEL IN CONTACT WITH SOMETHING THAT IS NON HUMAN AND THAT IS SO DEEPLY
AlaindeBotton_2009G@752.99:761.22 THE SCREEN WHO IS VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL CERTAIN IDEAS WOULD IMMEDIATELY COME TO MIND YOU WOULD THINK THAT PERSON MIGHT HAVE MADE A LOT OF MONEY ACHIEVED RENOWN IN SOME FIELD
AlaindeBotton_2009G@761.86:772.30 MY OWN THEORY OF SUCCESS AND I'M SOMEBODY WHO IS VERY INTERESTED IN SUCCESS I REALLY WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL I'M ALWAYS THINKING HOW COULD I BE MORE SUCCESSFUL BUT AS I GET OLDER I'M ALSO VERY NUANCED ABOUT WHAT THAT WORD SUCCESS MIGHT
AlaindeBotton_2009G@773.17:781.83 AN INSIGHT THAT I'VE HAD ABOUT SUCCESS YOU CAN'T BE SUCCESSFUL AT EVERYTHING WE HEAR A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WORK LIFE BALANCE NONSENSE YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ALL YOU
AlaindeBotton_2009G@782.49:791.66 SO ANY VISION OF SUCCESS HAS TO ADMIT WHAT IT'S LOSING OUT ON WHERE THE ELEMENT OF LOSS IS AND I THINK ANY WISE LIFE WILL ACCEPT AS I SAY
AlaindeBotton_2009G@792.35:798.25 THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE AN ELEMENT WHERE WE ARE NOT SUCCEEDING AND THE THING ABOUT A SUCCESSFUL LIFE IS A LOT OF THE TIME OUR IDEAS
AlaindeBotton_2009G@798.45:807.00 OF WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO LIVE SUCCESSFULLY ARE NOT OUR OWN THEY ARE SUCKED IN FROM OTHER PEOPLE CHIEFLY IF YOU'RE A MAN YOUR FATHER AND IF YOU'RE A WOMAN YOUR MOTHER
AlaindeBotton_2009G@826.15:835.46 WHEN WE'RE TOLD THAT BANKING IS A VERY RESPECTABLE PROFESSION A LOT OF US WANT TO GO INTO BANKING WHEN BANKING IS NO LONGER SO RESPECTABLE WE LOSE INTEREST IN BANKING WE ARE HIGHLY OPEN
AlaindeBotton_2009G@835.78:844.53 TO SUGGESTION SO WHAT I WANT TO ARGUE FOR IS NOT THAT WE SHOULD GIVE UP ON OUR IDEAS OF SUCCESS BUT WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE OUR OWN WE SHOULD FOCUS IN
AlaindeBotton_2009G@844.62:852.72 ON OUR IDEAS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE OWN THEM THAT WE ARE TRULY THE AUTHORS OF OUR OWN AMBITIONS BECAUSE IT'S BAD ENOUGH NOT GETTING WHAT YOU WANT
AlaindeBotton_2009G@853.69:863.64 EVEN WORSE TO HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT IT IS YOU WANT AND FIND OUT AT THE END OF A JOURNEY THAT IT ISN 'T IN FACT WHAT YOU WANTED ALL ALONG SO I'M GOING TO END IT THERE BUT
AlaindeBotton_2009G@864.12:878.16 WHAT I REALLY WANT TO STRESS IS BY ALL MEANS SUCCESS YES BUT LET 'S ACCEPT THE STRANGENESS OF SOME OF OUR IDEAS LET 'S PROBE AWAY AT OUR NOTIONS OF SUCCESS LET 'S MAKE SURE OUR IDEAS OF SUCCESS ARE TRULY OUR OWN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AlaindeBotton_2009G@895.17:904.41 THAT WAS FASCINATING HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THIS IDEA OF SOMEONE BEING IT BEING BAD TO THINK OF SOMEONE AS A LOSER
AlaindeBotton_2009G@905.57:915.11 THE IDEA THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE OF SEIZING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE AND THAT A SOCIETY THAT ENCOURAGES THAT PERHAPS HAS TO HAVE SOME WINNERS AND LOSERS
AlaindeBotton_2009G@915.63:929.44 YES I THINK IT'S MERELY THE RANDOMNESS OF THE WINNING AND LOSING PROCESS THAT I WANTED TO STRESS BECAUSE THE EMPHASIS NOWADAYS IS SO MUCH ON THE JUSTICE OF EVERYTHING AND POLITICIANS ALWAYS TALK ABOUT JUSTICE NOW I AM A FIRM BELIEVER IN JUSTICE I JUST THINK THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
AlaindeBotton_2009G@929.76:938.03 SO WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PURSUE IT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE SHOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT WHOEVER IS FACING US WHATEVER HAS HAPPENED
AlaindeBotton_2009G@945.49:957.90 I MEAN DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN COMBINE YOUR KIND OF KINDER GENTLER PHILOSOPHY OF WORK WITH A SUCCESSFUL ECONOMY OR DO YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN 'T BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER TOO MUCH THAT WE'RE PUTTING TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON
AlaindeBotton_2009G@959.17:969.63 THE NIGHTMARE THOUGHT IS THAT FRIGHTENING PEOPLE IS THE BEST WAY TO GET WORK OUT OF THEM AND THAT SOMEHOW THE CRUELER THE ENVIRONMENT THE MORE PEOPLE WILL RISE TO THE CHALLENGE
AlaindeBotton_2009G@970.21:982.32 YOU WANT TO THINK WHO WOULD YOU LIKE AS YOUR IDEAL DAD AND YOUR IDEAL DAD IS SOMEBODY WHO IS TOUGH BUT GENTLE AND IT'S A VERY HARD LINE TO MAKE WE NEED FATHERS AS IT WERE THE EXEMPLARY FATHER FIGURES IN SOCIETY
