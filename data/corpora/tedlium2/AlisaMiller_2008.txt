AlisaMiller_2008 THE NEWS SHAPE THE WAY WE SEE THE WORLD
AlisaMiller_2008 HERE 'S THE WORLD BASED ON THE WAY IT LOOKS BASED ON LANDMASS
AlisaMiller_2008 AND HERE 'S HOW NEWS SHAPES WHAT AMERICANS SEE
AlisaMiller_2008 NOW THIS WAS A MONTH WHEN NORTH KOREA AGREED TO DISMANTLE ITS NUCLEAR FACILITIES
AlisaMiller_2008 THERE WAS MASSIVE FLOODING IN INDONESIA AND IN PARIS THE IPCC RELEASED ITS STUDY CONFIRMING MAN 'S IMPACT
AlisaMiller_2008 ON GLOBAL WARMING
AlisaMiller_2008 THE U S ACCOUNTED FOR SEVENTY NINE PERCENT OF TOTAL NEWS COVERAGE
AlisaMiller_2008 AND WHEN WE TAKE OUT THE U S AND LOOK AT THE REMAINING TWENTY ONE PERCENT
AlisaMiller_2008 WE SEE A LOT OF IRAQ THAT 'S THAT BIG GREEN THING THERE
AlisaMiller_2008 REACHED JUST ONE PERCENT
AlisaMiller_2008 WHEN WE ANALYZED ALL THE NEWS STORIES
AlisaMiller_2008 AND REMOVED JUST ONE STORY HERE 'S HOW THE WORLD LOOKED
AlisaMiller_2008 AND THE CYCLE CONTINUES AS WE ALL KNOW BRITNEY HAS LOOMED PRETTY LARGE LATELY
AlisaMiller_2008 SO WHY DON 'T WE HEAR MORE ABOUT THE WORLD
AlisaMiller_2008 ONE REASON IS THAT NEWS NETWORKS HAVE REDUCED THE NUMBER OF THEIR FOREIGN BUREAUS BY HALF
AlisaMiller_2008 INDIA OR SOUTH AMERICA PLACES THAT ARE HOME TO MORE THAN TWO BILLION PEOPLE
AlisaMiller_2008 THE REALITY IS THAT COVERING BRITNEY
AlisaMiller_2008 LOCAL TV NEWS LOOMS LARGE
AlisaMiller_2008 AND UNFORTUNATELY ONLY DEDICATES TWELVE PERCENT OF ITS COVERAGE TO INTERNATIONAL NEWS
AlisaMiller_2008 THE MOST POPULAR NEWS SITES DON 'T DO MUCH BETTER LAST YEAR PEW AND THE COLOMBIA J SCHOOL ANALYZED THE FOURTEEN THOUSAND STORIES THAT APPEARED ON GOOGLE NEWS FRONT PAGE AND THEY IN FACT COVERED THE SAME TWENTY FOUR NEWS EVENTS
AlisaMiller_2008 SO IF YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER THIS COULD HELP EXPLAIN WHY TODAY 'S COLLEGE GRADUATES AS WELL AS LESS EDUCATED AMERICANS KNOW LESS ABOUT THE WORLD THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS DID TWENTY YEARS AGO
AlisaMiller_2008 AND IF YOU THINK IT 'S SIMPLY BECAUSE WE ARE NOT INTERESTED
AlisaMiller_2008 THE REAL QUESTION
AlisaMiller_2008 IS THIS DISTORTED WORLDVIEW
AlisaMiller_2008 WHAT WE WANT FOR AMERICANS IN OUR INCREASINGLY INTERCONNECTED WORLD
AlisaMiller_2008 I KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER AND CAN WE AFFORD NOT TO
AlisaMiller_2008 THANK YOU
