AbigailWashburn_2012U AND ASKED ME WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO WITH MY LIFE I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
AbigailWashburn_2012U EVER THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE BANJO
AbigailWashburn_2012U BEAUTIFUL THE SOUND OF DOC 'S VOICE AND THE RIPPLING GROOVE OF THE BANJO AND AFTER BEING
AbigailWashburn_2012U TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY OBSESSED WITH THE MAMMOTH RICHNESS AND HISTORY OF CHINESE CULTURE IT WAS LIKE THIS TOTAL RELIEF TO HEAR SOMETHING SO TRULY AMERICAN
AbigailWashburn_2012U TRULY AWESOME I KNEW I HAD TO TAKE A BANJO WITH ME TO CHINA
AbigailWashburn_2012U AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT I DIDN 'T GO TO CHINA TO BECOME A LAWYER IN FACT I WENT TO NASHVILLE
AbigailWashburn_2012U AND AFTER A FEW MONTHS I WAS WRITING SONGS AND THE FIRST SONG I WROTE WAS IN ENGLISH AND THE SECOND ONE WAS IN CHINESE
AbigailWashburn_2012U AND I 'VE PLAYED THOUSANDS OF SHOWS AND I 'VE COLLABORATED WITH SO MANY INCREDIBLE INSPIRATIONAL MUSICIANS AROUND THE WORLD AND I SEE THE POWER OF MUSIC I SEE THE POWER OF MUSIC TO CONNECT
AbigailWashburn_2012U CULTURES I SEE IT WHEN I STAND ON A STAGE IN A BLUEGRASS FESTIVAL IN EAST VIRGINIA AND I LOOK OUT AT THE SEA OF LAWN CHAIRS AND I BUST OUT INTO A SONG IN CHINESE
AbigailWashburn_2012U AND EVERYBODY 'S EYES JUST POP WIDE OPEN LIKE IT 'S GOING TO
AbigailWashburn_2012U AND I BUST OUT INTO A SONG IN CHINESE AND EVERYBODY SINGS ALONG AND THEY ROAR WITH DELIGHT AT THIS GIRL WITH THE HAIR AND THE INSTRUMENT AND SHE 'S SINGING THEIR MUSIC
AbigailWashburn_2012U AND I SEE EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THE POWER OF MUSIC TO CONNECT HEARTS LIKE THE TIME I WAS IN SICHUAN PROVINCE AND I WAS SINGING FOR KIDS IN RELOCATION SCHOOLS IN THE EARTHQUAKE DISASTER ZONE AND THIS LITTLE GIRL COMES UP TO ME
AbigailWashburn_2012U BIG SISTER WONG WASHBURN WONG SAME DIFFERENCE
AbigailWashburn_2012U BIG SISTER WONG CAN I SING YOU A SONG THAT MY MOM SANG FOR ME BEFORE SHE WAS SWALLOWED IN THE EARTHQUAKE
AbigailWashburn_2012U AND I SAT DOWN SHE SAT ON MY LAP SHE STARTED SINGING
AbigailWashburn_2012U AND THE WARMTH OF HER BODY
AbigailWashburn_2012U WAS A PLACE I COULD HAVE STAYED FOREVER AND IN THAT MOMENT WE WEREN 'T OUR AMERICAN SELVES WE WEREN 'T OUR CHINESE SELVES WE WERE JUST
AbigailWashburn_2012U MORTALS
AbigailWashburn_2012U SITTING TOGETHER IN THAT LIGHT THAT KEEPS US HERE
