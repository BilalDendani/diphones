AbigailWashburn_2012U@95.43:109.83 TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY OBSESSED WITH THE MAMMOTH RICHNESS AND HISTORY OF CHINESE CULTURE IT WAS LIKE THIS TOTAL RELIEF TO HEAR SOMETHING SO TRULY AMERICAN

AbigailWashburn_2012U@213.62:226.67 AND I 'VE PLAYED THOUSANDS OF SHOWS AND I 'VE COLLABORATED WITH SO MANY INCREDIBLE INSPIRATIONAL MUSICIANS AROUND THE WORLD AND I SEE THE POWER OF MUSIC I SEE THE POWER OF MUSIC TO CONNECT

AbigailWashburn_2012U@272.87:285.54 AND I BUST OUT INTO A SONG IN CHINESE AND EVERYBODY SINGS ALONG AND THEY ROAR WITH DELIGHT AT THIS GIRL WITH THE HAIR AND THE INSTRUMENT AND SHE 'S SINGING THEIR MUSIC
AbigailWashburn_2012U@285.54:305.15 AND I SEE EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THE POWER OF MUSIC TO CONNECT HEARTS LIKE THE TIME I WAS IN SICHUAN PROVINCE AND I WAS SINGING FOR KIDS IN RELOCATION SCHOOLS IN THE EARTHQUAKE DISASTER ZONE AND THIS LITTLE GIRL COMES UP TO ME
