KellyMcGonigal_2013G@12.92:24.81 HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE BUT FIRST I WANT YOU TO MAKE A LITTLE CONFESSION TO ME IN THE PAST YEAR
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@51.04:61.32 BUT I FEAR THAT SOMETHING I 'VE BEEN TEACHING FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS IS DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD AND IT HAS TO DO WITH STRESS
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@61.32:74.05 FOR YEARS I 'VE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE STRESS MAKES YOU SICK IT INCREASES THE RISK OF EVERYTHING FROM THE COMMON COLD TO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE BASICALLY I 'VE TURNED STRESS INTO THE ENEMY
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@80.65:96.55 LET ME START WITH THE STUDY THAT MADE ME RETHINK MY WHOLE APPROACH TO STRESS THIS STUDY TRACKED THIRTY THOUSAND ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR EIGHT YEARS AND THEY STARTED BY ASKING PEOPLE HOW MUCH STRESS HAVE YOU EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST YEAR
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@96.55:103.51 THEY ALSO ASKED DO YOU BELIEVE THAT STRESS IS HARMFUL FOR YOUR HEALTH
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@103.51:109.01 AND THEN THEY USED PUBLIC DEATH RECORDS TO FIND OUT WHO DIED
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@111.1:119.27 SOME BAD NEWS FIRST PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCED A LOT OF STRESS IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR HAD A FORTY THREE PERCENT INCREASED RISK OF DYING
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@119.27:128.01 BUT THAT WAS ONLY TRUE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ALSO BELIEVED THAT STRESS IS HARMFUL FOR YOUR HEALTH
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@130.83:144.53 PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCED A LOT OF STRESS BUT DID NOT VIEW STRESS AS HARMFUL WERE NO MORE LIKELY TO DIE IN FACT THEY HAD THE LOWEST RISK OF DYING OF ANYONE IN THE STUDY INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO HAD RELATIVELY LITTLE STRESS
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@144.53:157.57 NOW THE RESEARCHERS ESTIMATED THAT OVER THE EIGHT YEARS THEY WERE TRACKING DEATHS ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND AMERICANS DIED PREMATURELY NOT FROM STRESS BUT FROM THE BELIEF THAT STRESS IS BAD FOR YOU
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@168.98:175.18 IN THE UNITED STATES LAST YEAR KILLING MORE PEOPLE THAN SKIN CANCER HIV AIDS AND HOMICIDE
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@178.8:185.5 YOU CAN SEE WHY THIS STUDY FREAKED ME OUT HERE I 'VE BEEN SPENDING SO MUCH ENERGY TELLING PEOPLE
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@185.53:188.36 STRESS IS BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@188.36:202.12 SO THIS STUDY GOT ME WONDERING CAN CHANGING HOW YOU THINK ABOUT STRESS MAKE YOU HEALTHIER AND HERE THE SCIENCE SAYS YES WHEN YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT STRESS YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR BODY 'S RESPONSE TO STRESS
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@202.12:219.79 NOW TO EXPLAIN HOW THIS WORKS I WANT YOU ALL TO PRETEND THAT YOU ARE PARTICIPANTS IN A STUDY DESIGNED TO STRESS YOU OUT IT 'S CALLED THE SOCIAL STRESS TEST YOU COME INTO THE LABORATORY AND YOU 'RE TOLD YOU HAVE TO GIVE A FIVE MINUTE IMPROMPTU SPEECH ON YOUR
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@219.79:231.54 PERSONAL WEAKNESSES TO A PANEL OF EXPERT EVALUATORS SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND TO MAKE SURE YOU FEEL THE PRESSURE THERE ARE BRIGHT LIGHTS AND A CAMERA IN YOUR FACE KIND OF LIKE THIS
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@248.26:266.83 NOW THAT YOU 'RE SUFFICIENTLY DEMORALIZED TIME FOR PART TWO A MATH TEST AND UNBEKNOWNST TO YOU THE EXPERIMENTER HAS BEEN TRAINED TO HARASS YOU DURING IT NOW WE 'RE GOING TO ALL DO THIS TOGETHER IT 'S GOING TO BE FUN FOR ME
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@320.71:336.05 NOW THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT PARTICIPANTS WERE TOLD IN A STUDY CONDUCTED AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY BEFORE THEY WENT THROUGH THE SOCIAL STRESS TEST THEY WERE TAUGHT TO RETHINK THEIR STRESS RESPONSE AS HELPFUL THAT POUNDING HEART IS PREPARING YOU FOR ACTION
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@336.05:341.3 IF YOU 'RE BREATHING FASTER IT 'S NO PROBLEM IT 'S GETTING MORE OXYGEN TO YOUR BRAIN
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@341.3:355.56 AND PARTICIPANTS WHO LEARNED TO VIEW THE STRESS RESPONSE AS HELPFUL FOR THEIR PERFORMANCE WELL THEY WERE LESS STRESSED OUT LESS ANXIOUS MORE CONFIDENT BUT THE MOST FASCINATING FINDING TO ME WAS HOW THEIR PHYSICAL STRESS RESPONSE CHANGED
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@355.56:363.4 NOW IN A TYPICAL STRESS RESPONSE YOUR HEART RATE GOES UP AND YOUR BLOOD VESSELS CONSTRICT LIKE THIS
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@363.4:372.85 AND THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT CHRONIC STRESS IS SOMETIMES ASSOCIATED WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IT 'S NOT REALLY HEALTHY TO BE IN THIS STATE ALL THE TIME
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@372.85:391.8 BUT IN THE STUDY WHEN PARTICIPANTS VIEWED THEIR STRESS RESPONSE AS HELPFUL THEIR BLOOD VESSELS STAYED RELAXED LIKE THIS THEIR HEART WAS STILL POUNDING BUT THIS IS A MUCH HEALTHIER CARDIOVASCULAR PROFILE IT ACTUALLY LOOKS A LOT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IN MOMENTS OF JOY AND
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@391.85:406.03 OVER A LIFETIME OF STRESSFUL EXPERIENCES THIS ONE BIOLOGICAL CHANGE COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STRESS INDUCED HEART ATTACK AT AGE FIFTY AND LIVING WELL INTO YOUR NINETY
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@406.03:412.81 AND THIS IS REALLY WHAT THE NEW SCIENCE OF STRESS REVEALS THAT HOW YOU THINK ABOUT STRESS MATTERS
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@412.81:428.98 SO MY GOAL AS A HEALTH PSYCHOLOGIST HAS CHANGED I NO LONGER WANT TO GET RID OF YOUR STRESS I WANT TO MAKE YOU BETTER AT STRESS AND WE JUST DID A LITTLE INTERVENTION IF YOU RAISED YOUR HAND AND SAID YOU 'D HAD A LOT OF STRESS IN THE LAST YEAR WE COULD HAVE SAVED YOUR LIFE
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@428.98:441.84 BECAUSE HOPEFULLY THE NEXT TIME YOUR HEART IS POUNDING FROM STRESS YOU 'RE GOING TO REMEMBER THIS TALK AND YOU 'RE GOING TO THINK TO YOURSELF THIS IS MY BODY HELPING ME RISE TO THIS CHALLENGE
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@441.84:449.59 AND WHEN YOU VIEW STRESS IN THAT WAY YOUR BODY BELIEVES YOU AND YOUR STRESS RESPONSE BECOMES HEALTHIER
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@449.59:468.77 NOW I SAID I HAVE OVER A DECADE OF DEMONIZING STRESS TO REDEEM MYSELF FROM SO WE ARE GOING TO DO ONE MORE INTERVENTION I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST UNDER APPRECIATED ASPECTS OF THE STRESS RESPONSE AND THE IDEA IS THIS STRESS MAKES YOU SOCIAL
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@468.77:475.05 TO UNDERSTAND THIS SIDE OF STRESS WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT A HORMONE OXYTOCIN AND I KNOW
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@489.11:501.31 OXYTOCIN IS A NEURO HORMONE IT FINE TUNES YOUR BRAIN 'S SOCIAL INSTINCTS IT PRIMES YOU TO DO THINGS THAT STRENGTHEN CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@501.31:513.03 OXYTOCIN MAKES YOU CRAVE PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY IT ENHANCES YOUR EMPATHY IT EVEN MAKES YOU MORE WILLING TO HELP AND SUPPORT THE PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@513.03:518.83 SOME PEOPLE HAVE EVEN SUGGESTED WE SHOULD SNORT OXYTOCIN
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@519:522.3 TO BECOME MORE COMPASSIONATE AND CARING
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@522.3:527.52 BUT HERE 'S WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON 'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT OXYTOCIN
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@527.52:530.76 IT 'S A STRESS HORMONE
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@530.76:541.89 YOUR PITUITARY GLAND PUMPS THIS STUFF OUT AS PART OF THE STRESS RESPONSE IT 'S AS MUCH A PART OF YOUR STRESS RESPONSE AS THE ADRENALINE THAT MAKES YOUR HEART POUND
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@555.75:563.98 YOUR STRESS RESPONSE WANTS TO MAKE SURE YOU NOTICE WHEN SOMEONE ELSE IN YOUR LIFE IS STRUGGLING SO THAT YOU CAN SUPPORT EACH OTHER
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@563.98:572.53 WHEN LIFE IS DIFFICULT YOUR STRESS RESPONSE WANTS YOU TO BE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT YOU
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@586.4:602.84 SYSTEM FROM THE EFFECTS OF STRESS IT 'S A NATURAL ANTI INFLAMMATORY IT ALSO HELPS YOUR BLOOD VESSELS STAY RELAXED DURING STRESS BUT MY FAVORITE EFFECT ON THE BODY IS ACTUALLY ON THE HEART YOUR HEART HAS RECEPTORS FOR THIS HORMONE
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@602.84:614.95 AND OXYTOCIN HELPS HEART CELLS REGENERATE AND HEAL FROM ANY STRESS INDUCED DAMAGE THIS STRESS HORMONE STRENGTHENS YOUR HEART
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@614.95:623.69 AND THE COOL THING IS THAT ALL OF THESE PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF OXYTOCIN ARE ENHANCED BY SOCIAL CONTACT AND SOCIAL SUPPORT
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@623.69:637.47 SO WHEN YOU REACH OUT TO OTHERS UNDER STRESS EITHER TO SEEK SUPPORT OR TO HELP SOMEONE ELSE YOU RELEASE MORE OF THIS HORMONE YOUR STRESS RESPONSE BECOMES HEALTHIER AND YOU ACTUALLY RECOVER FASTER FROM STRESS
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@637.47:644.85 I FIND THIS AMAZING THAT YOUR STRESS RESPONSE HAS A BUILT IN MECHANISM FOR STRESS
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@644.85:650 RESILIENCE AND THAT MECHANISM IS HUMAN CONNECTION
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@650:657.99 I WANT TO FINISH BY TELLING YOU ABOUT ONE MORE STUDY AND LISTEN UP BECAUSE THIS STUDY COULD ALSO SAVE A LIFE
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@657.99:671.83 THIS STUDY TRACKED ABOUT ONE THOUSAND ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THEY RANGED IN AGE FROM THIRTY FOUR TO NINETY THREE AND THEY STARTED THE STUDY BY ASKING HOW MUCH STRESS HAVE YOU EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST YEAR
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@671.83:676.03 THEY ALSO ASKED HOW MUCH TIME HAVE YOU SPENT
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@676.06:681.78 HELPING OUT FRIENDS NEIGHBORS PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@681.78:686.7 AND THEN THEY USED PUBLIC RECORDS FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TO FIND OUT WHO DIED
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@686.7:699.69 OKAY SO THE BAD NEWS FIRST FOR EVERY MAJOR STRESSFUL LIFE EXPERIENCE LIKE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OR FAMILY CRISIS THAT INCREASED THE RISK OF DYING BY THIRTY PERCENT
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@719.54:734.88 AND SO WE SEE ONCE AGAIN THAT THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF STRESS ON YOUR HEALTH ARE NOT INEVITABLE HOW YOU THINK AND HOW YOU ACT CAN TRANSFORM YOUR EXPERIENCE OF STRESS WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO VIEW YOUR STRESS
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@734.88:736.85 AS HELPFUL
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@737.22:741.72 YOU CREATE THE BIOLOGY OF COURAGE
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@741.72:748.85 AND WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO CONNECT WITH OTHERS UNDER STRESS YOU CAN CREATE RESILIENCE
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@748.85:765.07 NOW I WOULDN 'T NECESSARILY ASK FOR MORE STRESSFUL EXPERIENCES IN MY LIFE BUT THIS SCIENCE HAS GIVEN ME A WHOLE NEW APPRECIATION FOR STRESS STRESS GIVES US ACCESS TO OUR HEARTS
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@765.07:779.25 THE COMPASSIONATE HEART THAT FINDS JOY AND MEANING IN CONNECTING WITH OTHERS AND YES YOUR POUNDING PHYSICAL HEART WORKING SO HARD TO GIVE YOU STRENGTH AND ENERGY
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@779.25:782.4 AND WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO VIEW STRESS IN THIS WAY
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@783.16:792.66 YOU 'RE NOT JUST GETTING BETTER AT STRESS YOU 'RE ACTUALLY MAKING A PRETTY PROFOUND STATEMENT YOU 'RE SAYING THAT YOU CAN TRUST YOURSELF
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@792.75:802.31 TO HANDLE LIFE 'S CHALLENGES AND YOU 'RE REMEMBERING THAT YOU DON 'T HAVE TO FACE THEM ALONE
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@812.97:817.53 THIS IS KIND OF AMAZING WHAT YOU 'RE TELLING US IT SEEMS AMAZING TO ME THAT A BELIEF
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@817.53:823.17 ABOUT STRESS CAN MAKE SO MUCH DIFFERENCE TO SOMEONE 'S LIFE EXPECTANCY
KellyMcGonigal_2013G@823.17:840.03 HOW WOULD THAT EXTEND TO ADVICE LIKE IF SOMEONE IS MAKING A LIFESTYLE CHOICE BETWEEN SAY A STRESSFUL JOB AND A NON STRESSFUL JOB DOES IT MATTER WHICH WAY THEY GO IT 'S EQUALLY WISE TO GO FOR THE STRESSFUL JOB SO LONG AS YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN HANDLE IT IN SOME SENSE
