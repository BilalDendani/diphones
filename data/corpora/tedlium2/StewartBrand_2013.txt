StewartBrand_2013@30.44:32.43 DIED AT THE CINCINNATI ZOO
StewartBrand_2013@33.6:42.01 THIS HAD BEEN THE MOST ABUNDANT BIRD IN THE WORLD THAT 'D BEEN IN NORTH AMERICA FOR SIX MILLION YEARS SUDDENLY IT WASN 'T HERE AT ALL
StewartBrand_2013@43.66:49.37 FLOCKS THAT WERE A MILE WIDE AND FOUR HUNDRED MILES LONG USED TO DARKEN THE SUN
StewartBrand_2013@56.44:62.2 AND INDEED IT WAS A KEYSTONE SPECIES THAT ENRICHED THE ENTIRE EASTERN DECIDUOUS FOREST
StewartBrand_2013@72.81:74.67 WELL COMMERCIAL HUNTING HAPPENED
StewartBrand_2013@75.06:76.97 THESE BIRDS WERE HUNTED FOR MEAT
StewartBrand_2013@79.21:91.3 AND IT WAS EASY TO DO BECAUSE WHEN THOSE BIG FLOCKS CAME DOWN TO THE GROUND THEY WERE SO DENSE THAT HUNDREDS OF HUNTERS AND NETTERS COULD SHOW UP AND SLAUGHTER THEM BY THE TENS OF THOUSANDS IT WAS THE CHEAPEST SOURCE OF PROTEIN IN AMERICA
StewartBrand_2013@91.37:97.49 BY THE END OF THE CENTURY THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT BUT THESE BEAUTIFUL SKINS IN MUSEUM SPECIMEN DRAWERS
StewartBrand_2013@98.79:100.46 THERE 'S AN UPSIDE TO THE STORY
StewartBrand_2013@100.62:106.2 THIS MADE PEOPLE REALIZE THAT THE SAME THING WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO THE AMERICAN BISON AND SO THESE BIRDS
StewartBrand_2013@106.22:107.77 SAVED THE BUFFALOS
StewartBrand_2013@138.87:158.74 ANOTHER KEYSTONE SPECIES IS A FAMOUS ANIMAL CALLED THE EUROPEAN AUROCHS THERE WAS SORT OF A MOVIE MADE ABOUT IT RECENTLY AND THE AUROCHS WAS LIKE THE BISON THIS WAS AN ANIMAL THAT BASICALLY KEPT THE FOREST MIXED WITH GRASSLANDS ACROSS THE ENTIRE EUROPE AND ASIAN CONTINENT FROM SPAIN TO KOREA
StewartBrand_2013@158.98:163.63 THE DOCUMENTATION OF THIS ANIMAL GOES BACK TO THE LASCAUX CAVE PAINTINGS
StewartBrand_2013@164.99:171.4 THE EXTINCTIONS STILL GO ON THERE 'S AN IBEX IN SPAIN CALLED THE BUCARDO IT WENT EXTINCT IN TWO THOUSAND
StewartBrand_2013@180.71:186.73 IT WAS HUNTED UNTIL THERE WERE JUST A FEW LEFT TO DIE IN ZOOS A LITTLE BIT OF FILM WAS SHOT
StewartBrand_2013@199.39:201.6 SORROW ANGER
StewartBrand_2013@229.12:241.44 GEORGE CHURCH ONE OF THE LEADING GENETIC ENGINEERS WHO TURNED OUT TO BE ALSO OBSESSED WITH PASSENGER PIGEONS AND A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THAT METHODOLOGIES HE WAS WORKING ON MIGHT ACTUALLY DO THE DEED
StewartBrand_2013@252.14:256.05 AND FORTUNATELY PASSENGER PIGEON DNA HAD ALREADY BEEN SEQUENCED
StewartBrand_2013@259.52:277.36 ALL SHE NEEDED FROM THOSE SPECIMENS AT THE SMITHSONIAN WAS A LITTLE BIT OF TOE PAD TISSUE BECAUSE DOWN IN THERE IS WHAT IS CALLED ANCIENT DNA IT 'S DNA WHICH IS PRETTY BADLY FRAGMENTED BUT WITH GOOD TECHNIQUES NOW YOU CAN BASICALLY REASSEMBLE THE WHOLE GENOME THEN THE QUESTION IS
StewartBrand_2013@277.4:280.41 CAN YOU REASSEMBLE WITH THAT GENOME THE WHOLE BIRD
StewartBrand_2013@280.8:282.86 GEORGE CHURCH THINKS YOU CAN
StewartBrand_2013@283.4:291.34 SO IN HIS BOOK REGENESIS WHICH I RECOMMEND HE HAS A CHAPTER ON THE SCIENCE OF BRINGING BACK EXTINCT SPECIES AND HE HAS A MACHINE
StewartBrand_2013@302.47:306.75 AND THE ONES THAT WIN THAT YOU CAN THEN PUT INTO A LIVING ORGANISM IT 'LL WORK
StewartBrand_2013@306.93:311.72 THE PRECISION OF THIS ONE OF GEORGE 'S FAMOUS UNREADABLE SLIDES NEVERTHELESS
StewartBrand_2013@333.19:341.16 SO THIS IS A FORM OF SYNTHETIC HYBRIDIZATION OF THE GENOME OF AN EXTINCT SPECIES WITH THE GENOME OF ITS CLOSEST LIVING RELATIVE
StewartBrand_2013@344.74:352.06 HIS TECHNOLOGY THE TECHNOLOGY OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY IS CURRENTLY ACCELERATING AT FOUR TIMES THE RATE OF MOORE 'S LAW
StewartBrand_2013@352.08:355.65 IT 'S BEEN DOING THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AND IT 'S LIKELY TO CONTINUE
StewartBrand_2013@356.44:362.28 OKAY THE CLOSEST LIVING RELATIVE OF THE PASSENGER PIGEON IS THE BAND TAILED PIGEON THEY 'RE ABUNDANT THERE 'S SOME AROUND HERE
StewartBrand_2013@371.36:377.5 IF YOU REPLACE THOSE BITS WITH PASSENGER PIGEON BITS YOU 'VE GOT THE EXTINCT BIRD BACK COOING
StewartBrand_2013@399.5:413.67 SO THIS MEETING IN BOSTON LED TO THREE THINGS FIRST OFF RYAN AND I DECIDED TO CREATE A NONPROFIT CALLED REVIVE AND RESTORE THAT WOULD PUSH DE EXTINCTION GENERALLY AND TRY TO HAVE IT GO IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY
StewartBrand_2013@414.03:416.84 AND WE WOULD PUSH AHEAD WITH THE PASSENGER PIGEON
StewartBrand_2013@416.97:430.24 ANOTHER DIRECT RESULT WAS A YOUNG GRAD STUDENT NAMED BEN NOVAK WHO HAD BEEN OBSESSED WITH PASSENGER PIGEONS SINCE HE WAS FOURTEEN AND HAD ALSO LEARNED HOW TO WORK WITH ANCIENT DNA HIMSELF SEQUENCED THE PASSENGER PIGEON
StewartBrand_2013@430.57:434.85 USING MONEY FROM HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS WE HIRED HIM FULL TIME
StewartBrand_2013@437.29:441.19 LAST YEAR AT THE SMITHSONIAN HE 'S LOOKING DOWN AT MARTHA
StewartBrand_2013@441.58:443.71 THE LAST PASSENGER PIGEON ALIVE
StewartBrand_2013@446.56:455.16 THE THIRD RESULT OF THE BOSTON MEETING WAS THE REALIZATION THAT THERE ARE SCIENTISTS ALL OVER THE WORLD WORKING ON VARIOUS FORMS OF DE EXTINCTION BUT THEY 'D NEVER MET EACH OTHER
StewartBrand_2013@504.4:508.64 AND SO BASICALLY ITS GENOME IS ALIVE IT 'S JUST UNEVENLY DISTRIBUTED
StewartBrand_2013@510.2:516.86 SO WHAT THEY 'RE DOING IS WORKING WITH SEVEN BREEDS OF PRIMITIVE HARDY LOOKING CATTLE LIKE THAT MAREMMANA PRIMITIVO ON THE TOP THERE
StewartBrand_2013@543.24:544.88 ANOTHER AMAZING STORY
StewartBrand_2013@545.16:548.21 CAME FROM ALBERTO FERNANDEZ ARIAS
StewartBrand_2013@554.7:556.45 WHO WAS STILL ALIVE
StewartBrand_2013@556.86:564.58 BUT THEN THEY CAPTURED HER THEY GOT A LITTLE BIT OF TISSUE FROM HER EAR THEY CRYOPRESERVED IT IN LIQUID NITROGEN
StewartBrand_2013@564.93:569.71 RELEASED HER BACK INTO THE WILD BUT A FEW MONTHS LATER SHE WAS FOUND DEAD UNDER A FALLEN TREE
StewartBrand_2013@570.01:572.4 THEY TOOK THE DNA FROM THAT EAR
StewartBrand_2013@572.99:575.99 THEY PLANTED IT AS A CLONED EGG IN A GOAT
StewartBrand_2013@576.43:578.15 THE PREGNANCY CAME TO TERM
StewartBrand_2013@578.33:582.63 AND A LIVE BABY BUCARDO WAS BORN IT WAS THE FIRST DE EXTINCTION IN HISTORY
StewartBrand_2013@590.7:606.21 RESPIRATION PROBLEMS THIS ONE HAD A MALFORMED LUNG AND DIED AFTER TEN MINUTES BUT ALBERTO WAS CONFIDENT THAT CLONING HAS MOVED ALONG WELL SINCE THEN AND THIS WILL MOVE AHEAD AND EVENTUALLY THERE WILL BE A POPULATION OF BUCARDOS BACK IN THE MOUNTAINS IN NORTHERN SPAIN
StewartBrand_2013@607.22:620.11 CRYOPRESERVATION PIONEER OF GREAT DEPTH IS OLIVER RYDER AT THE SAN DIEGO ZOO HIS FROZEN ZOO HAS COLLECTED THE TISSUES FROM OVER ONE THOUSAND SPECIES OVER THE LAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS
StewartBrand_2013@662.49:680.05 SO NOW WE GO TO MIKE MCGREW WHO IS A SCIENTIST AT ROSLIN INSTITUTE IN SCOTLAND AND MIKE 'S DOING MIRACLES WITH BIRDS SO HE 'LL TAKE SAY FALCON SKIN CELLS FIBROBLAST TURN IT INTO INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS SINCE IT 'S SO PLURIPOTENT IT CAN BECOME GERM PLASM
StewartBrand_2013@680.05:687.08 HE THEN HAS A WAY TO PUT THE GERM PLASM INTO THE EMBRYO OF A CHICKEN EGG SO THAT THAT
StewartBrand_2013@702.83:707.52 BEN NOVAK WAS THE YOUNGEST SCIENTIST AT THE MEETING HE SHOWED HOW ALL OF THIS CAN BE PUT TOGETHER
StewartBrand_2013@707.81:716.06 THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS HE 'LL PUT TOGETHER THE GENOMES OF THE BAND TAILED PIGEON AND THE PASSENGER PIGEON HE 'LL TAKE THE TECHNIQUES OF GEORGE CHURCH
StewartBrand_2013@716.06:731.75 AND GET PASSENGER PIGEON DNA THE TECHNIQUES OF ROBERT LANZA AND MICHAEL MCGREW GET THAT DNA INTO CHICKEN GONADS AND OUT OF THE CHICKEN GONADS GET PASSENGER PIGEON EGGS SQUABS AND NOW YOU 'RE GETTING A POPULATION OF PASSENGER PIGEONS IT DOES RAISE THE QUESTION
StewartBrand_2013@755.19:757.87 AND FEEDING GROUNDS
StewartBrand_2013@757.99:774.38 THERE WERE SOME CONSERVATIONISTS REALLY FAMOUS CONSERVATIONISTS LIKE STANLEY TEMPLE WHO IS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF CONSERVATION BIOLOGY AND KATE JONES FROM THE IUCN WHICH DOES THE RED LIST THEY 'RE EXCITED ABOUT ALL THIS BUT THEY 'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT IT MIGHT BE COMPETITIVE
StewartBrand_2013@774.4:781.07 WITH THE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT EFFORTS TO PROTECT ENDANGERED SPECIES THAT ARE STILL ALIVE THAT HAVEN 'T GONE EXTINCT YET
StewartBrand_2013@811.1:816.72 SPECIES THAT WERE ENDANGERED LIKE THE BALD EAGLE BUT THEY 'RE MUCH BETTER OFF NOW THANKS TO EVERYBODY 'S GOOD WORK
StewartBrand_2013@816.9:824.16 AND PROTECTED AREAS AROUND THE WORLD THAT ARE VERY VERY WELL MANAGED SO BASICALLY THEY 'RE LEARNING HOW TO BUILD ON GOOD NEWS
StewartBrand_2013@849.59:857.18 THAT TECHNOLOGY WILL BE USED ON DE EXTINCTED ANIMALS ANOTHER SUCCESS STORY IS THE MOUNTAIN GORILLA IN CENTRAL AFRICA
StewartBrand_2013@878.94:882.84 THAT 'S HOW COMFORTABLE THESE WILD GORILLAS ARE WITH VISITORS
StewartBrand_2013@883.5:898.86 ANOTHER INTERESTING PROJECT THOUGH IT 'S GOING TO NEED SOME HELP IS THE NORTHERN WHITE RHINOCEROS THERE 'S NO BREEDING PAIRS LEFT BUT THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT A WIDE VARIETY OF DNA FOR THIS ANIMAL IS AVAILABLE IN THE FROZEN ZOO A BIT OF CLONING YOU CAN GET THEM BACK
StewartBrand_2013@901.62:905.82 THESE HAVE BEEN PRIVATE MEETINGS SO FAR I THINK IT 'S TIME FOR THE SUBJECT TO GO PUBLIC
StewartBrand_2013@906.08:911.67 WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK ABOUT IT YOU KNOW DO YOU WANT EXTINCT SPECIES BACK DO YOU WANT EXTINCT SPECIES BACK
StewartBrand_2013@925.87:933.18 WE 'RE ALSO GOING TO PUSH AHEAD WITH THE PASSENGER PIGEON SO BEN NOVAK EVEN AS WE SPEAK IS JOINING THE GROUP THAT
StewartBrand_2013@960.73:967.18 MAYBE FOR THE NEXT SIX MILLION YEARS YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING AS THE COSTS COME DOWN FOR THE CAROLINA PARAKEET
StewartBrand_2013@969:974.97 FOR THE GREAT AUK FOR THE HEATH HEN FOR THE IVORY BILLED WOODPECKER FOR THE ESKIMO CURLEW FOR THE CARIBBEAN MONK SEAL FOR THE WOOLLY
StewartBrand_2013@982.36:984.14 WE HAVE THE ABILITY NOW
StewartBrand_2013@984.44:987.93 AND MAYBE THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO REPAIR SOME OF THE DAMAGE
StewartBrand_2013@991.41:995.56 EXPANDING AND PROTECTING WILDLANDS BY EXPANDING AND PROTECTING
StewartBrand_2013@995.62:998.37 THE POPULATIONS OF ENDANGERED SPECIES
StewartBrand_2013@1000.06:1003.06 BUT SOME SPECIES THAT WE KILLED
StewartBrand_2013@1010.63:1013.04 TO A WORLD THAT MISSES THEM
StewartBrand_2013@1051.57:1057.92 UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES YOU 'RE GOING TO UNCORK SOME SORT OF PANDORA 'S BOX OF WHO KNOWS WHAT
StewartBrand_2013@1072.05:1075.99 NOW THERE 'S THE SHIFTING BASELINE PROBLEM WHICH IS SO WHEN THESE THINGS COME BACK
StewartBrand_2013@1083.67:1090.88 THIS IS A LONG SLOW PROCESS ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE ABOUT IT IT 'S MULTI GENERATION WE WILL GET WOOLLY MAMMOTHS BACK
