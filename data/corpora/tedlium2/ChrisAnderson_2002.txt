ChrisAnderson_2002@16.28:27.07 THIS IS YOUR CONFERENCE AND I THINK YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT RIGHT NOW IN THIS TRANSITION PERIOD ABOUT THIS GUY WHO 'S GOING TO BE LOOKING AFTER IT FOR YOU FOR
ChrisAnderson_2002@40.52:51.25 YEARS AGO AT TED I THINK I'VE COME TO THIS CONCLUSION I THINK I MAY HAVE BEEN SUFFERING FROM A STRANGE DELUSION
ChrisAnderson_2002@52.59:62.27 I THINK THAT I MAY HAVE BELIEVED UNCONSCIOUSLY THEN THAT I WAS KIND OF A BUSINESS HERO
ChrisAnderson_2002@64.04:72.04 HAD THIS COMPANY THAT I'D SPENT FIFTEEN YEARS BUILDING IT WAS CALLED FUTURE IT WAS A MAGAZINE PUBLISHING COMPANY IT HAD RECENTLY GONE PUBLIC
ChrisAnderson_2002@72.65:78.53 AND THE MARKET SAID THAT IT WAS APPARENTLY WORTH TWO BILLION DOLLARS A NUMBER I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
ChrisAnderson_2002@80.61:89.55 A MAGAZINE I'D RECENTLY LAUNCHED CALLED BUSINESS TWO POINT ZERO WAS FATTER THAN A TELEPHONE DIRECTORY BUSY PUMPING HOT AIR INTO THE BUBBLE
ChrisAnderson_2002@93.25:101.48 AND I WAS THE FORTY PERCENT OWNER OF A DOT COM THAT WAS ABOUT TO GO PUBLIC AND NO DOUBT BE WORTH BILLIONS MORE
ChrisAnderson_2002@102.04:113.00 AND ALL THIS HAD COME FROM NOTHING FIFTEEN YEARS EARLIER I WAS A SCIENCE JOURNALIST WHO PEOPLE JUST LAUGHED AT WHEN I SAID I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO START MY OWN COMPUTER MAGAZINE
ChrisAnderson_2002@114.15:127.62 AND FIFTEEN YEARS LATER THERE ARE THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED OF THEM AND TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE ON STAFF AND IT WAS JUST SUCH HEADY TIMES THE DATE WAS FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND I THOUGHT THE LITTLE
ChrisAnderson_2002@128.34:134.59 OF MY BUSINESS LIFE THAT KIND OF LOOKED A BIT LIKE MOORE 'S LAW EVER UPWARD ONTO THE RIGHT IT WAS GOING TO GO ON FOREVER I MEAN IT HAD TO
ChrisAnderson_2002@137.45:140.12 I WAS IN FOR QUITE A SURPRISE
ChrisAnderson_2002@142.90:154.26 THE DOT COM IRONICALLY CALLED SNOWBALL WAS THE VERY LAST CONSUMER WEB COMPANY TO GO PUBLIC THE NEXT MONTH BEFORE NASDAQ EXPLODED AND
ChrisAnderson_2002@155.93:163.16 I ENTERED EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF BUSINESS HELL I SAW I WATCHED EVERYTHING THAT
ChrisAnderson_2002@164.75:170.77 CRUMBLING AND IT LOOKED LIKE ALL THIS STUFF WAS GOING TO DIE AND FIFTEEN YEARS WORK WOULD HAVE COME FOR NOTHING
ChrisAnderson_2002@181.49:192.94 IN THE BUSINESS FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND AND ONE IN ONE DAY WE LAID OFF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE AND BEFORE THE BLOODSHED WAS FINISHED ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE HAD LOST THEIR JOBS FROM FROM MY COMPANIES
ChrisAnderson_2002@201.82:207.93 BY ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS A DAY EVERY DAY FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS
ChrisAnderson_2002@208.35:218.90 AND WORSE THAN THAT FAR WORSE THAN THAT MY SENSE OF SELF WORTH WAS KIND OF EVAPORATING I WAS GOING AROUND WITH THIS BIG SIGN ON MY FOREHEAD LOSER
ChrisAnderson_2002@220.46:231.85 AND I THINK WHAT DISGUSTS ME MORE THAN ANYTHING LOOKING BACK IS HOW THE HELL DID I LET MY PERSONAL HAPPINESS GET SO TIED UP WITH THIS BUSINESS THING
ChrisAnderson_2002@235.39:246.34 IN THE END WE WERE ABLE TO SAVE FUTURE AND SNOWBALL BUT I WAS AT THAT POINT READY TO MOVE ON AND TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT HERE 'S WHERE I CAME TO
ChrisAnderson_2002@247.45:254.42 AND THE REASON I'M TELLING THIS STORY IS THAT I BELIEVE FROM MANY CONVERSATIONS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM
ChrisAnderson_2002@255.16:267.27 HAVE BEEN THROUGH A SIMILAR KIND OF ROLLERCOASTER EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THIS HAS BEEN A BIG BIG TRANSITION TIME AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS CONFERENCE CAN
ChrisAnderson_2002@269.02:282.92 A BIG PART FOR ALL OF US IN TAKING US FORWARD TO THE NEXT STAGE TO WHATEVER 'S NEXT THE THEME NEXT YEAR IS RE BIRTH IT WAS AT THE SAME TED TWO YEARS AGO WHEN RICHARD AND I REACHED AN AGREEMENT ON
ChrisAnderson_2002@283.21:295.35 THE FUTURE OF TED AND AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AND I THINK PARTLY BECAUSE OF THAT I STARTED DOING SOMETHING THAT I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT IN MY BUSINESS FOCUS I STARTED TO READ AGAIN
ChrisAnderson_2002@297.55:305.81 AND I DISCOVERED THAT WHILE I'D BEEN BUSY PLAYING BUSINESS GAMES THERE'D BEEN THIS INCREDIBLE REVOLUTION IN SO MANY AREAS OF
ChrisAnderson_2002@306.65:315.38 INTEREST COSMOLOGY TO PSYCHOLOGY TO EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY TO ANTHROPOLOGY TO YOU KNOW ALL THIS STUFF HAD CHANGED AND
ChrisAnderson_2002@315.89:325.76 THE WAY IN WHICH YOU COULD THINK ABOUT US AS A SPECIES AND US AS A PLANET HAD JUST CHANGED SO MUCH AND IT WAS INCREDIBLY EXCITING AND WHAT WAS REALLY MOST EXCITING
ChrisAnderson_2002@326.37:333.07 AND I THINK RICHARD WURMAN DISCOVERED THIS AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS BEFORE I DID WAS THAT ALL THIS STUFF
ChrisAnderson_2002@333.33:340.61 IS CONNECTED IT'S CONNECTED IT ALL HOOKS INTO EACH OTHER WE TALK ABOUT THIS A LOT AND I THOUGHT ABOUT TRYING TO
ChrisAnderson_2002@341.58:353.21 OF THIS JUST ONE EXAMPLE MADAME DE GAULLE THE WIFE OF THE FRENCH PRESIDENT WAS FAMOUSLY ASKED ONCE WHAT DO YOU MOST DESIRE AND SHE
ChrisAnderson_2002@356.15:365.24 AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT'S VERY TRUE WHAT WE ALL MOST DESIRE IS A PENIS OR YOU KNOW HAPPINESS AS WE SAY IN ENGLISH
ChrisAnderson_2002@381.09:382.72 THAT ONE IN THE JAPANESE TRANSLATION
ChrisAnderson_2002@401.43:412.40 TODAY IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE'S DOZENS OF TED LIKE QUESTIONS THAT YOU CAN ASK ABOUT IT WHICH ARE REALLY INTERESTING YOU CAN ASK ABOUT WHAT CAUSES IT BIOCHEMICALLY NEUROSCIENCE SEROTONIN ALL THAT STUFF
ChrisAnderson_2002@412.77:422.18 YOU CAN ASK WHAT ARE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CAUSES OF IT NATURE NURTURE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCE TURNS OUT THAT THE RESEARCH DONE ON THAT IS ABSOLUTELY MIND BLOWING
ChrisAnderson_2002@423.42:434.51 YOU CAN VIEW IT AS A COMPUTING PROBLEM AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROBLEM WHY DO YOU NEED TO INCORPORATE SOME SORT OF ANALOG OF HAPPINESS INTO A COMPUTER BRAIN TO MAKE IT WORK PROPERLY
ChrisAnderson_2002@435.67:443.03 YOU CAN VIEW IT IN SORT OF GEOPOLITICAL TERMS AND SAY WHY IS IT THAT A BILLION PEOPLE ON THIS PLANET
ChrisAnderson_2002@443.67:450.26 ARE SO DESPERATELY NEEDY THAT THEY HAVE NO POSSIBILITY OF HAPPINESS AND WHEREAS ALMOST ALL THE REST OF THEM
ChrisAnderson_2002@459.78:470.39 OR YOU CAN VIEW IT AS AN EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY KIND OF THING WHY WOULD OUR DID OUR GENES INVENT THIS AS A KIND OF TRICK TO GET US TO BEHAVE IN CERTAIN WAYS
ChrisAnderson_2002@471.73:478.73 BRAIN PARASITIZED TO MAKE US BEHAVE IN CERTAIN WAYS SO THAT OUR GENES WOULD PROPAGATE ARE WE THE VICTIMS OF A MASS DELUSION AND SO
ChrisAnderson_2002@481.10:488.99 TO UNDERSTAND EVEN SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT TO US AS HAPPINESS YOU KIND OF HAVE TO BRANCH OFF IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND THERE'S NOWHERE
ChrisAnderson_2002@489.72:501.88 THAT I'VE DISCOVERED OTHER THAN TED WHERE YOU CAN ASK THAT MANY QUESTIONS IN THAT MANY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND SO IT'S THE PROFOUND THING THAT RICHARD TALKS ABOUT TO UNDERSTAND
ChrisAnderson_2002@503.02:515.93 YOU JUST NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE LITTLE BITS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT SURROUNDS IT AND SO GRADUALLY OVER THESE THREE DAYS YOU START OFF KIND OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY AM I LISTENING TO ALL THIS IRRELEVANT STUFF AND AT THE END OF THE FOUR DAYS
ChrisAnderson_2002@517.12:524.21 BRAIN IS HUMMING AND YOU FEEL ENERGIZED ALIVE AND EXCITED AND IT'S BECAUSE ALL THESE DIFFERENT BITS HAVE BEEN PUT TOGETHER IT'S THE TOTAL
ChrisAnderson_2002@524.39:529.24 BRAIN EXPERIENCE WE'RE GOING TO IT'S THE MENTAL EQUIVALENT OF THE FULL BODY MASSAGE EVERY MENTAL
ChrisAnderson_2002@531.17:538.82 REALLY IS ENOUGH OF THE THEORY CHRIS TELL US WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO DO ALL RIGHT SO
ChrisAnderson_2002@539.03:545.89 I WILL HERE 'S THE VISION FOR TED NUMBER ONE DO NOTHING THIS THING AIN'T BROKE SO I
ChrisAnderson_2002@549.09:556.16 JEFF BEZOS KINDLY REMARKED TO ME CHRIS TED IS A REALLY GREAT CONFERENCE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FUCK UP REALLY BADLY
ChrisAnderson_2002@563.00:567.45 SO I GAVE MYSELF THE JOB TITLE OF TED
ChrisAnderson_2002@579.67:584.56 DIVERSITY NO SELLING NO CORPORATE BULLSHIT
ChrisAnderson_2002@587.83:590.89 NO BANDWAGONING NO PLATFORMS
ChrisAnderson_2002@593.50:600.96 JUST THE PURSUIT OF INTEREST WHEREVER IT LIES ACROSS ALL THE DISCIPLINES THAT ARE REPRESENTED HERE THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE CHANGED AT ALL
ChrisAnderson_2002@610.57:624.83 THE TIME SCALE ON WHICH TED OPERATES IS JUST FANTASTIC AFTER COMING OUT OF A MAGAZINE BUSINESS WITH MONTHLY DEADLINES THERE'S A YEAR TO DO THIS AND ALREADY AS I HOPE TO SHOW YOU A BIT LATER THERE'S TWENTY FIVE OR SO TERRIFIC SPEAKERS SIGNED UP FOR NEXT YEAR
ChrisAnderson_2002@643.36:649.52 DO WANT TO IF I CAN FIND A WAY OF EXTENDING THE TED EXPERIENCE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR
ChrisAnderson_2002@650.40:659.15 AND ONE KEY WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS IS TO INTRODUCE THIS BOOK CLUB BOOKS KIND OF SAVED ME IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND
ChrisAnderson_2002@661.99:673.78 THAT'S A GIFT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO PASS ON SO WHEN YOU SIGN UP FOR TED TWO THOUSAND AND THREE EVERY SIX WEEKS YOU'LL GET A CARE PACKAGE WITH A BOOK OR TWO AND A REASON WHY THEY'RE LINKED TO TED THEY MAY WELL BE BY A TED SPEAKER
ChrisAnderson_2002@681.82:689.13 I THINK IT WILL BE GREAT AND THEN FOURTHLY I WANT TO MENTION THE
ChrisAnderson_2002@689.74:696.98 FOUNDATION WHICH IS THE NEW OWNER OF TED WHAT SAPLING 'S OWNERSHIP MEANS IS THAT ALL OF THE PROCEEDS OF TED WILL GO TOWARDS
ChrisAnderson_2002@697.62:704.88 THE CAUSES THAT SAPLING STANDS FOR AND MORE IMPORTANT I THINK THE IDEAS
ChrisAnderson_2002@705.13:710.35 THAT ARE EXHIBITED AND REALIZED HERE
ChrisAnderson_2002@711.68:725.17 IDEAS THAT THE FOUNDATION CAN USE BECAUSE THERE'S FANTASTIC SYNERGY ALREADY JUST IN THE LAST FEW DAYS WE'VE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT STUFF THAT THEY CARE ABOUT THAT THEY'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD AND THE IDEA OF GETTING THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE TOGETHER
ChrisAnderson_2002@725.83:733.97 SOME OF THE CAUSES THAT WE BELIEVE IN THE MONEY THAT THIS CONFERENCE CAN RAISE AND THE IDEAS I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THAT COMBINATION WILL
ChrisAnderson_2002@734.47:747.88 TIME MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M INCREDIBLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT IN FACT I DON'T THINK OVERALL THAT I'VE BEEN AS EXCITED BY ANYTHING EVER IN MY LIFE I'M IN THIS FOR THE LONG RUN
ChrisAnderson_2002@748.94:754.48 AND I WOULD BE GREATLY HONORED AND EXCITED IF YOU'LL COME ON THIS JOURNEY WITH ME
