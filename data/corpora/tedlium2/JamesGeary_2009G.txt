JamesGeary_2009G@17.72:27.37 LIVES A SECRET LIFE ALL AROUND US WE UTTER ABOUT SIX METAPHORS A MINUTE METAPHORICAL THINKING IS ESSENTIAL TO HOW WE UNDERSTAND OURSELVES
JamesGeary_2009G@27.74:38.38 AND OTHERS HOW WE COMMUNICATE LEARN DISCOVER AND INVENT BUT METAPHOR IS A WAY OF THOUGHT BEFORE IT IS A WAY WITH WORDS
JamesGeary_2009G@39.17:47.98 NOW TO ASSIST ME IN EXPLAINING THIS I'VE ENLISTED THE HELP OF ONE OF OUR GREATEST PHILOSOPHERS THE REIGNING KING OF THE METAPHORIANS
JamesGeary_2009G@48.44:61.58 A MAN WHOSE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FIELD ARE SO GREAT THAT HE HIMSELF HAS BECOME A METAPHOR I AM OF COURSE REFERRING TO NONE OTHER THAN ELVIS PRESLEY
JamesGeary_2009G@76.08:83.13 IN ALL SHOOK UP A TOUCH IS NOT A TOUCH BUT A CHILL LIPS ARE NOT LIPS BUT VOLCANOES
JamesGeary_2009G@83.78:91.11 SHE IS NOT SHE BUT A BUTTERCUP AND LOVE IS NOT LOVE BUT BEING ALL SHOOK UP
JamesGeary_2009G@91.60:101.33 IN THIS ELVIS IS FOLLOWING ARISTOTLE 'S CLASSIC DEFINITION OF METAPHOR AS THE PROCESS OF GIVING THE THING A NAME THAT BELONGS TO SOMETHING ELSE
JamesGeary_2009G@101.99:109.33 THIS IS THE MATHEMATICS OF METAPHOR AND FORTUNATELY IT'S VERY SIMPLE X EQUALS Y
JamesGeary_2009G@111.33:122.12 THIS FORMULA WORKS WHEREEVER METAPHOR IS PRESENT ELVIS USES IT BUT SO DOES SHAKESPEARE IN THIS FAMOUS LINE FROM ROMEO AND JULIET JULIET IS THE SUN
JamesGeary_2009G@122.89:129.55 NOW HERE SHAKESPEARE GIVES THE THING JULIET A NAME THAT BELONGS TO SOMETHING ELSE THE
JamesGeary_2009G@131.26:141.85 BUT WHENEVER WE GIVE A THING A NAME THAT BELONGS TO SOMETHING ELSE WE GIVE IT A WHOLE NETWORK OF ANALOGIES TOO WE MIX AND MATCH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE METAPHOR 'S SOURCE IN THIS CASE THE SUN
JamesGeary_2009G@142.10:152.41 WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT ITS TARGET JULIET AND METAPHOR GIVES US A MUCH MORE VIVID UNDERSTANDING OF JULIET THAN IF SHAKESPEARE HAD LITERALLY DESCRIBED WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE
JamesGeary_2009G@153.41:161.76 SO HOW DO WE MAKE AND UNDERSTAND METAPHORS THIS MIGHT LOOK FAMILIAR THE FIRST STEP IS PATTERN RECOGNITION LOOK AT THIS IMAGE WHAT DO YOU SEE
JamesGeary_2009G@180.07:188.43 NOW SYNESTHESIA IS THE EXPERIENCE OF A STIMULUS IN ONCE SENSE ORGAN IN ANOTHER SENSE ORGAN AS WELL SUCH AS COLORED HEARING
JamesGeary_2009G@188.88:197.64 PEOPLE WITH COLORED HEARING ACTUALLY SEE COLORS WHEN THEY HEAR THE SOUNDS OF WORDS OR LETTERS WE ALL HAVE SYNESTHETIC ABILITIES
JamesGeary_2009G@198.12:206.29 THIS IS THE BOUBA KIKI TEST WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS IDENTIFY WHICH OF THESE SHAPES IS CALLED BOUBA AND WHICH IS CALLED KIKI
JamesGeary_2009G@207.40:214.57 IF YOU ARE LIKE NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF OTHER PEOPLE YOU WILL IDENTIFY THE ROUND AMOEBIOD SHAPE AS BOUBA AND THE SHARP SPIKY ONE
JamesGeary_2009G@214.78:223.59 AS KIKI CAN WE DO A QUICK SHOW OF HANDS DOES THAT CORRESPOND OKAY I THINK NINETY NINE POINT NINE WOULD ABOUT COVER IT
JamesGeary_2009G@224.96:232.68 WHY DO WE DO THAT BECAUSE WE INSTINCTIVELY FIND OR CREATE A PATTERN BETWEEN THE ROUND SHAPE
JamesGeary_2009G@232.91:239.82 AND THE ROUND SOUND OF BOUBA AND THE SPIKY SHAPE AND THE SPIKY SOUND OF KIKI
JamesGeary_2009G@240.52:248.16 AND MANY OF THE METAPHORS WE USE EVERYDAY ARE SYNESTHETIC SILENCE IS SWEET NECKTIES ARE LOUD
JamesGeary_2009G@262.73:276.60 THIRD STEP IS COGNITIVE DISSONANCE THIS IS THE STROOP TEST WHAT YOU NEED TO DO HERE IS IDENTIFY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THE COLOR OF THE INK IN WHICH THESE WORDS ARE PRINTED YOU CAN TAKE THE TEST NOW
JamesGeary_2009G@286.23:294.64 THE TEST SHOWS THAT WE CAN NOT IGNORE THE LITERAL MEANING OF WORDS EVEN WHEN THE LITERAL MEANING GIVES THE WRONG ANSWER STROOP TESTS HAVE BEEN DONE WITH METAPHOR AS WELL
JamesGeary_2009G@295.36:306.60 PARTICIPANTS HAD TO IDENTIFY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THE LITERALLY FALSE SENTENCES THEY TOOK LONGER TO REJECT METAPHORS AS FALSE THAN THEY DID TO REJECT LITERALLY FALSE SENTENCES
JamesGeary_2009G@307.28:315.82 WHY BECAUSE WE CANNOT IGNORE THE METAPHORICAL MEANING OF WORDS EITHER ONE OF THE SENTENCES WAS SOME JOBS ARE JAILS
JamesGeary_2009G@316.57:329.69 NOW UNLESS YOU'RE A PRISON GUARD THE SENTENCE SOME JOBS ARE JAILS IS LITERALLY FALSE SADLY IT'S METAPHORICALLY TRUE AND THE METAPHORICAL TRUTH INTERFERES WITH OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY IT AS LITERALLY FALSE
JamesGeary_2009G@341.52:349.28 AGENT METAPHORS DESCRIBE PRICE MOVEMENTS AS THE DELIBERATE ACTION OF A LIVING THING AS IN THE NASDAQ CLIMBED HIGHER
JamesGeary_2009G@370.39:377.11 THOSE EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE AGENT METAPHORS IMPLY THE DELIBERATE ACTION OF A LIVING THING PURSUING A GOAL
JamesGeary_2009G@377.62:386.70 IF FOR EXAMPLE HOUSE PRICES ARE ROUTINELY DESCRIBED AS CLIMBING AND CLIMBING HIGHER AND HIGHER PEOPLE MIGHT NATURALLY ASSUME THAT THAT RISE IS UNSTOPPABLE
JamesGeary_2009G@386.93:397.82 THEY MAY FEEL CONFIDENT SAY IN TAKING OUT MORTGAGES THEY REALLY CAN'T AFFORD THAT'S A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE OF COURSE BUT THIS IS HOW METAPHOR MISLEADS
JamesGeary_2009G@416.59:425.39 THEY WERE EACH THEN GIVEN ONE OF THREE DESCRIPTIONS OF THIS HYPOTHETICAL CRISIS EACH OF WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO TRIGGER A DIFFERENT HISTORICAL ANALOGY
JamesGeary_2009G@425.82:435.86 WORLD WAR II VIETNAM AND THE THIRD WAS HISTORICALLY NEUTRAL THOSE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD WAR II SCENARIO MADE MORE INTERVENTIONIST RECOMMENDATIONS THAN THE OTHERS
JamesGeary_2009G@452.99:459.62 WITH WHAT WE DON'T KNOW AND THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE LATTER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE WAYS IT MIGHT BE LIKE THE FORMER
JamesGeary_2009G@460.53:472.35 EINSTEIN DESCRIBED HIS SCIENTIFIC METHOD AS COMBINATORY PLAY HE FAMOUSLY USED THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY ELABORATE ANALOGIES TO COME UP WITH SOME OF HIS GREATEST DISCOVERIES
JamesGeary_2009G@472.96:481.38 BY BRINGING TOGETHER WHAT WE KNOW AND WHAT WE DON'T KNOW THROUGH ANALOGY METAPHORICAL THINKING STRIKES THE SPARK THAT IGNITES DISCOVERY
JamesGeary_2009G@491.17:502.10 RALPH WALDO EMERSON DESCRIBED LANGUAGE AS FOSSIL POETRY BUT BEFORE IT WAS FOSSIL POETRY LANGUAGE WAS FOSSIL METAPHOR AND THESE FOSSILS STILL BREATHE
JamesGeary_2009G@503.48:514.01 TAKE THE THREE MOST FAMOUS WORDS IN ALL OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY COGITO ERGO SUM IT IS ROUTINELY TRANSLATED AS I THINK THEREFORE I AM
JamesGeary_2009G@529.40:536.95 AND THE PROPER TRANSLATION OF COGITO ERGO SUM IS I SHAKE THINGS UP THEREFORE I AM
JamesGeary_2009G@545.84:553.05 THE MIND IS A PLASTIC SNOW DOME THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOST INTERESTING AND MOST ITSELF WHEN AS ELVIS PUT IT
JamesGeary_2009G@553.78:561.34 IT'S ALL SHOOK UP AND METAPHOR KEEPS THE MIND SHAKING RATTLING AND ROLLING LONG AFTER ELVIS HAS LEFT THE BUILDING THANK YOU VERY MUCH
