RayZahab_2009 A MONTH AGO TODAY I STOOD THERE
RayZahab_2009 NINETY DEGREES SOUTH THE TOP OF THE BOTTOM OF THE WORLD THE GEOGRAPHIC SOUTH POLE AND I STOOD THERE BESIDE TWO VERY GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE RICHARD WEBER AND KEVIN VALLELY TOGETHER WE HAD JUST BROKEN THE WORLD SPEED RECORD FOR A TREK TO THE SOUTH POLE
RayZahab_2009 TOOK US THIRTY THREE DAYS TWENTY THREE HOURS AND FIFTY FIVE MINUTES TO GET THERE WE SHAVED FIVE DAYS OFF THE PREVIOUS BEST TIME AND IN THE PROCESS I BECAME THE FIRST PERSON IN HISTORY
RayZahab_2009 TO MAKE THE ENTIRE SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILE JOURNEY FROM HERCULES INLET TO SOUTH POLE SOLELY ON FEET WITHOUT SKIS NOW MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY SAYING WAIT A SEC IS THIS TOUGH TO DO
RayZahab_2009 IMAGINE IF YOU WILL DRAGGING A SLED AS YOU JUST SAW IN THAT VIDEO CLIP WITH ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY POUNDS OF GEAR IN IT EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO SURVIVE
RayZahab_2009 ON YOUR ANTARCTIC TREK IT'S GOING TO BE FORTY BELOW EVERY SINGLE DAY YOU'LL BE IN A MASSIVE HEADWIND AND AT SOME POINT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CROSS THESE CRACKS IN THE ICE THESE
RayZahab_2009 SOME OF THEM HAVE A VERY PRECARIOUS THIN FOOTBRIDGE UNDERNEATH THEM THAT COULD GIVE WAY AT A MOMENT 'S NOTICE TAKING YOUR SLED YOU INTO THE ABYSS NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN
RayZahab_2009 THE PUNCHLINE TO YOUR JOURNEY LOOK AT THE HORIZON YES IT'S UPHILL THE ENTIRE WAY BECAUSE THE SOUTH POLE IS AT TEN THOUSAND FEET AND YOU'RE STARTING AT SEA LEVEL
RayZahab_2009 AND WHILE WE WERE THERE WE LEARNED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE WATER CRISIS IN NORTHERN AFRICA WE ALSO LEARNED THAT MANY OF THE ISSUES FACING THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN AFRICA AFFECTED YOUNG PEOPLE THE MOST
RayZahab_2009 WE ARE CAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING WE SET OUR MINDS TO BUT IF I'M GOING TO CONTINUE DOING THESE ADVENTURES THERE HAS TO BE A REASON FOR ME TO DO THEM BEYOND JUST GETTING THERE
RayZahab_2009 AROUND THAT TIME I MET AN EXTRAORDINARY HUMAN BEING PETER THUM WHO INSPIRED ME WITH HIS ACTIONS HE 'S TRYING TO FIND AND SOLVE WATER ISSUES THE CRISIS AROUND THE WORLD HIS DEDICATION INSPIRED ME
RayZahab_2009 TO COME UP WITH THIS EXPEDITION A RUN TO THE SOUTH POLE WHERE WITH AN INTERACTIVE WEBSITE I WILL BE ABLE TO BRING YOUNG PEOPLE STUDENTS AND TEACHERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD ON BOARD THE EXPEDITION WITH ME
RayZahab_2009 AS ACTIVE MEMBERS SO WE WOULD HAVE A LIVE WEBSITE THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY OF THE THIRTY THREE DAYS WE WOULD BE BLOGGING TELLING STORIES OF YOU KNOW DEPLETED OZONE FORCING US TO COVER OUR FACES OR WE WILL BURN

RayZahab_2009 BATTERIES DO YOU CARRY FOR ALL THE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU HAVE VIRTUALLY NONE ALL OF OUR EQUIPMENT INCLUDING FILM EQUIPMENT WAS CHARGED BY THE SUN AND DO YOU GET ALONG
RayZahab_2009 I CERTAINLY HOPE SO BECAUSE AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER ON THIS EXPEDITION ONE OF YOUR TEAMMATES IS GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE A VERY BIG NEEDLE AND PUT IT IN AN INFECTED BLISTER AND DRAIN IT FOR YOU
RayZahab_2009 BUT SERIOUSLY SERIOUSLY WE DID GET ALONG BECAUSE WE HAD A COMMON GOAL OF WANTING TO INSPIRE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE THEY WERE OUR TEAMMATES THEY WERE INSPIRING US
