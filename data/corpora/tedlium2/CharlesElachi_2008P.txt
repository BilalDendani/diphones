CharlesElachi_2008P@16.23:20.50 I THOUGHT I'D START WITH TELLING YOU OR SHOWING YOU THE PEOPLE WHO STARTED
CharlesElachi_2008P@21.65:31.42 THEY WERE A BUNCH OF KIDS THEY WERE KIND OF VERY IMAGINATIVE VERY ADVENTUROUS AS THEY WERE TRYING AT CALTECH TO MIX CHEMICALS AND SEE WHICH ONE BLOWS UP MORE WELL I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT YOU TRY TO DO THAT NOW
CharlesElachi_2008P@32.90:39.34 UP A SHACK AND CALTECH WELL THEN HEY YOU GO TO THE ARROYO AND REALLY DO ALL YOUR TESTS IN THERE SO THAT'S WHAT WE CALL OUR FIRST
CharlesElachi_2008P@48.54:59.37 WAS KIND OF PART OF A CULT WHICH WAS NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE ON ORANGE GROVE AND UNFORTUNATELY HE BLEW UP HIMSELF BECAUSE HE KEPT MIXING CHEMICALS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONES WERE THE BEST
CharlesElachi_2008P@71.18:83.39 I TRIED TO COME LIKE HIM THIS MORNING BUT AS I WALKED OUT THEN IT WAS TOO COLD AND I SAID I'D BETTER PUT MY SHIRT BACK ON BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE REASON I WANTED TO SHOW THIS PICTURE LOOK WHERE THE OTHER PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AND LOOK WHERE HE IS LOOKING
CharlesElachi_2008P@84.99:91.69 WHEREVER ANYBODY ELSE LOOKS LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE AND GO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT YOU KNOW AND DOING THAT AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT HAS BEEN THE SPIRIT
CharlesElachi_2008P@115.33:126.68 IN OUR EARLY DAYS WE USED TO WORK A LOT ON ROCKETS BUT WE ALSO USED TO HAVE A LOT OF PARTIES YOU KNOW AS YOU CAN SEE ONE OF OUR PARTIES YOU KNOW A FEW YEARS AGO BUT THEN A BIG DIFFERENCE HAPPENED ABOUT FIFTY YEARS AGO
CharlesElachi_2008P@127.25:135.40 SPUTNIK WAS LAUNCHED WE LAUNCHED THE FIRST AMERICAN SATELLITE AND THAT'S THE ONE YOU SEE ON THE LEFT IN THERE AND HERE WE MADE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES CHANGE
CharlesElachi_2008P@135.72:146.96 WE CHANGED FROM A ROCKET HOUSE TO BE AN EXPLORATION HOUSE AND THAT WAS DONE OVER A PERIOD OF A COUPLE OF YEARS AND NOW WE ARE THE LEADING ORGANIZATION YOU KNOW EXPLORING SPACE ON ALL OF YOUR BEHALF
CharlesElachi_2008P@147.30:156.63 BUT EVEN WHEN WE DID THAT WE HAD TO REMIND OURSELVES SOMETIMES THERE ARE SETBACKS SO YOU SEE ON THE BOTTOM THAT ROCKET WAS SUPPOSED TO GO UPWARD SOMEHOW IT ENDED GOING SIDEWAYS
CharlesElachi_2008P@157.07:167.90 SO THAT'S WHAT WE CALL THE MISGUIDED MISSILE BUT THEN ALSO JUST TO CELEBRATE THAT WE STARTED AN EVENT AT JPL FOR MISS GUIDED MISSILE SO WE USED TO HAVE A CELEBRATION EVERY YEAR AND SELECT
CharlesElachi_2008P@168.79:181.58 TO BE COMPETITION AND PARADES AND SO ON IT'S NOT VERY APPROPRIATE TO DO IT NOW SOME PEOPLE TELL ME TO DO IT I THINK WELL THAT'S NOT REALLY PROPER YOU KNOW THESE DAYS SO WE DO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE IN THE LAST
CharlesElachi_2008P@182.04:190.68 ROSE BOWL YOU KNOW WHEN WE ENTERED ONE OF THE FLOATS THAT'S MORE ON THE PLAY SIDE AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE THAT'S THE ROVER JUST BEFORE WE FINISHED ITS TESTING
CharlesElachi_2008P@191.13:197.32 TO TAKE IT TO THE CAPE TO LAUNCH IT THESE ARE THE ROVERS UP HERE THAT YOU HAVE ON MARS NOW SO THAT KIND OF TELLS YOU ABOUT KIND OF THE FUN THINGS
CharlesElachi_2008P@197.71:206.35 YOU KNOW AND THE SERIOUS THINGS THAT WE TRY TO DO BUT I SAID I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A SHORT CLIP OF ONE OF OUR EMPLOYEES TO KIND OF GIVE YOU AN IDEA ABOUT SOME OF THE
CharlesElachi_2008P@232.15:241.02 BEING ABLE TO TREAT SOUND AS AN INSTRUMENT AND BE ABLE TO DIG FOR MORE ABSTRACT SOUNDS AND THINGS TO PLAY LIVE MIXING ELECTRONICS AND
CharlesElachi_2008P@258.04:259.14 THE
CharlesElachi_2008P@273.45:281.88 NOW MOVING FROM THE PLAY STUFF TO THE SERIOUS STUFF ALWAYS PEOPLE ASK WHY DO WE EXPLORE WHY ARE WE DOING ALL OF THESE MISSIONS AND WHY ARE WE EXPLORING THEM
CharlesElachi_2008P@282.29:290.96 WELL THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT IS FAIRLY SIMPLE SOMEHOW THIRTEEN BILLION YEARS AGO THERE WAS A BIG BANG AND YOU'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU KNOW THE ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE BUT SOMEHOW
CharlesElachi_2008P@291.19:298.80 WHAT STRIKES EVERYBODY 'S IMAGINATION OR LOTS OF PEOPLE 'S IMAGINATION SOMEHOW FROM THAT ORIGINAL BIG BANG WE HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN TODAY
CharlesElachi_2008P@311.98:321.38 HOW DID THAT EVOLVE HOW DID THE UNIVERSE FORM HOW DID THE GALAXIES FORM HOW DID THE PLANETS FORM WHY IS THERE A PLANET ON WHICH THERE IS LIFE WHICH HAVE EVOLVED IS THAT VERY COMMON
CharlesElachi_2008P@321.95:330.88 LIFE ON EVERY PLANET THAT YOU CAN SEE AROUND THE STARS SO WE LITERALLY ARE ALL MADE OUT OF STARDUST WE STARTED FROM THOSE STARS WE ARE MADE OF STARDUST SO
CharlesElachi_2008P@337.40:347.14 BUT LITERALLY WE ARE ALL MADE OF STARDUST SO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IN OUR EXPLORATION IS EFFECTIVELY WRITE THE BOOK OF HOW THINGS HAVE CAME ABOUT AS THEY ARE TODAY
CharlesElachi_2008P@347.79:357.25 AND ONE OF THE FIRST OR THE EASIEST PLACES WE CAN GO AND EXPLORE THAT IS TO GO TOWARDS MARS AND THE REASON MARS TAKES PARTICULAR ATTENTION IT'S NOT VERY FAR FROM US
CharlesElachi_2008P@372.83:384.35 IT HAS AN ATMOSPHERE SOMEWHAT THINNER THAN OURS SO IT HAS WEATHER SO IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO SOME EXTENT AND YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE FEATURES ON IT LIKE THE GRAND CANYON ON MARS OR WHAT WE CALL THE GRAND CANYON ON MARS
CharlesElachi_2008P@384.89:393.49 IS LIKE THE GRAND CANYON ON EARTH EXCEPT A HELL OF A LOT LARGER SO IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE YOU KNOW OF THE UNITED STATES IT HAS VOLCANOES ON IT
CharlesElachi_2008P@394.72:400.70 AND THAT'S MOUNT OLYMPUS ON MARS WHICH IS A KIND OF HUGE VOLCANIC SHIELD
CharlesElachi_2008P@401.08:412.30 ON THAT PLANET AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE HEIGHT OF IT AND YOU COMPARE IT TO MOUNT EVEREST YOU SEE IT'LL GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW LARGE THAT MOUNT OLYMPUS YOU KNOW IS RELATIVE TO MOUNT EVEREST
CharlesElachi_2008P@412.84:421.63 SO IT BASICALLY DWARFS YOU KNOW MOUNT EVEREST HERE ON EARTH SO THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE TECTONIC EVENTS OR VOLCANIC EVENTS WHICH HAVE HAPPENED ON THAT PLANET
CharlesElachi_2008P@422.65:430.64 FROM ONE OF OUR SATELLITES THIS SHOWS THAT IT'S EARTH LIKE WE CAUGHT A LANDSLIDE OCCURRING AS IT WAS HAPPENING SO IT IS A DYNAMIC PLANET
CharlesElachi_2008P@430.86:439.09 AND ACTIVITY IS GOING ON AS WE SPEAK TODAY AND THESE ROVERS PEOPLE WONDER NOW WHAT ARE THEY DOING TODAY SO I THOUGHT I WOULD SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT
CharlesElachi_2008P@447.89:459.95 AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S BELOW THE SURFACE SO THIS IS CALLED VICTORIA CRATER WHICH IS ABOUT A FEW FOOTBALL FIELDS IN SIZE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP LEFT YOU SEE A LITTLE TEENY DARK DOT THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN FROM AN ORBITING SATELLITE
CharlesElachi_2008P@460.41:471.50 IF I ZOOM ON IT YOU CAN SEE THAT'S THE ROVER ON THE SURFACE SO THAT WAS TAKEN FROM ORBIT WE HAD THE CAMERA ZOOM ON THE SURFACE AND WE ACTUALLY SAW THE ROVER ON THE SURFACE AND WE ACTUALLY USED THE COMBINATION
CharlesElachi_2008P@471.77:479.58 OF THE SATELLITE IMAGES AND THE ROVER TO ACTUALLY CONDUCT SCIENCE BECAUSE WE CAN OBSERVE LARGE AREAS AND THEN YOU CAN GET THOSE ROVERS TO MOVE AROUND
CharlesElachi_2008P@480.29:489.14 AND BASICALLY GO TO A CERTAIN LOCATION SO SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW IS THAT ROVER IS GOING DOWN IN THAT CRATER AS I TOLD YOU GEOLOGISTS LOVE CRATERS
CharlesElachi_2008P@489.42:498.62 AND THE REASON IS MANY OF YOU WENT TO THE GRAND CANYON AND YOU SEE IN THE WALL OF THE GRAND CANYON YOU SEE THESE LAYERS AND WHAT THESE LAYERS THAT'S WHAT THE SURFACE USED TO BE
CharlesElachi_2008P@499.09:500.31 MILLION YEARS AGO
CharlesElachi_2008P@500.68:510.59 TEN MILLION YEARS AGO A HUNDRED MILLION YEARS AGO AND YOU GET DEPOSITS ON TOP OF THEM SO IF YOU CAN READ THE LAYERS IT'S LIKE READING YOUR BOOK AND YOU CAN LEARN THE HISTORY OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST
CharlesElachi_2008P@510.79:518.79 IN THAT LOCATION SO WHAT YOU ARE SEEING HERE ARE THE LAYERS ON THE WALL OF THAT CRATER AND THE ROVER IS GOING DOWN NOW MEASURING YOU KNOW THE
CharlesElachi_2008P@526.98:536.90 A SLOPE LIKE THIS IF YOU WERE THERE YOU WOULDN'T DO IT YOURSELF BUT WE REALLY MADE SURE WE TESTED THOSE ROVERS BEFORE WE GOT THEM DOWN OR THAT ROVER AND MADE SURE THAT IT'S ALL WORKING WELL
CharlesElachi_2008P@537.29:545.66 NOW WHEN I CAME LAST TIME SHORTLY AFTER THE LANDING I THINK IT WAS LIKE A HUNDRED DAYS AFTER THE LANDING I TOLD YOU I WAS SURPRISED THAT THOSE ROVERS ARE LASTING EVEN A HUNDRED DAYS
CharlesElachi_2008P@547.03:557.51 ARE FOUR YEARS LATER AND THEY'RE STILL WORKING NOW YOU SAY CHARLES YOU ARE REALLY LYING TO US AND SO ON BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE WE REALLY BELIEVED THEY WERE GOING TO LAST NINETY DAYS OR ONE HUNDRED DAYS BECAUSE THEY ARE SOLAR
CharlesElachi_2008P@558.29:571.75 AND MARS IS A DUSTY PLANET SO WE EXPECTED THE DUST WOULD START ACCUMULATING ON THE SURFACE AND AFTER A WHILE WE WOULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH POWER YOU KNOW TO KEEP THEM WARM WELL I ALWAYS SAY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU ARE SMART BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE IT'S GOOD TO BE LUCKY
CharlesElachi_2008P@572.27:581.80 AND THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND OUT IT TURNED OUT THAT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THERE ARE DUST DEVILS WHICH COME BY ON MARS AS YOU ARE SEEING HERE AND WHEN THE DUST DEVIL COMES OVER THE ROVER IT JUST CLEANS IT
CharlesElachi_2008P@582.60:590.20 LIKE A BRAND NEW CAR THAT YOU HAVE AND THAT'S LITERALLY WHY THEY HAVE LASTED SO LONG AND NOW WE DESIGNED THEM REASONABLY WELL
CharlesElachi_2008P@590.88:605.01 BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHY THEY ARE LASTING THAT LONG AND STILL PROVIDING ALL THE SCIENCE DATA NOW THE TWO ROVERS EACH ONE OF THEM IS KIND OF GETTING OLD YOU KNOW ONE OF THEM ONE OF THE WHEELS IS STUCK IS NOT WORKING ONE OF THE FRONT WHEELS SO WHAT WE ARE DOING WE ARE DRIVING IT BACKWARDS
CharlesElachi_2008P@605.72:615.76 AND THE OTHER ONE HAS ARTHRITIS OF THE SHOULDER JOINT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT WORKING VERY WELL SO IT'S WALKING LIKE THIS AND WE CAN MOVE THE ARM YOU KNOW THAT WAY BUT STILL THEY ARE PRODUCING A LOT OF SCIENTIFIC DATA
CharlesElachi_2008P@616.36:625.55 NOW DURING THAT WHOLE PERIOD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE GOT EXCITED YOU KNOW OUTSIDE THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY ABOUT THESE ROVERS SO I THOUGHT I'D SHOW YOU A VIDEO JUST TO GIVE YOU A REFLECTION
CharlesElachi_2008P@626.14:634.25 HOW THESE ROVERS ARE BEING VIEWED BY PEOPLE OTHER THAN THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY SO LET ME GO ON THE NEXT SHORT VIDEO
CharlesElachi_2008P@661.08:662.26 DUTCH WILL FIND
CharlesElachi_2008P@669.89:670.17 WHAT IS
CharlesElachi_2008P@693.91:702.70 SO ANYWAY LET ME CONTINUE ON SHOWING YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BEAUTY OF THAT PLANET AS I SAID EARLIER IT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE EARTH SO YOU SEE SAND DUNES
CharlesElachi_2008P@703.15:709.22 IT LOOKS LIKE I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THESE ARE PICTURES TAKEN FROM THE SAHARA DESERT OR SOMEWHERE AND YOU'D HAVE BELIEVED ME BUT THESE ARE PICTURES TAKEN FROM MARS
CharlesElachi_2008P@709.54:718.89 BUT ONE AREA WHICH IS PARTICULARLY INTRIGUING FOR US IS THE NORTHERN REGION YOU KNOW OF MARS CLOSE TO THE NORTH POLE BECAUSE WE SEE ICE CAPS AND WE SEE THE ICE CAPS SHRINKING AND EXPANDING
CharlesElachi_2008P@719.35:733.25 SO IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE YOU HAVE IN NORTHERN CANADA AND WE WANTED TO FIND OUT AND WE SEE ALL KINDS OF GLACIAL FEATURES ON IT SO WE WANTED TO FIND OUT ACTUALLY WHAT IS THAT ICE MADE OF AND COULD THAT HAVE EMBEDDED IN IT SOME ORGANIC YOU KNOW MATERIAL
CharlesElachi_2008P@734.27:741.23 SO WE HAVE A SPACECRAFT WHICH IS HEADING TOWARDS MARS CALLED PHOENIX AND THAT SPACECRAFT WILL LAND SEVENTEEN DAYS SEVEN HOURS
CharlesElachi_2008P@741.78:750.37 AND TWENTY SECONDS FROM NOW SO YOU CAN ADJUST YOUR WATCH SO IT'S ON MAY TWENTY FIVE AROUND JUST BEFORE FIVE O'CLOCK OUR TIME HERE ON THE WEST COAST
CharlesElachi_2008P@781.80:782.99 AND TAKE SAMPLES THAT
CharlesElachi_2008P@783.88:789.37 AND ACTUALLY HEAT THEM AND LOOK WHAT GASES WILL COME FROM IT SO THIS WAS LAUNCHED ABOUT NINE MONTHS AGO
CharlesElachi_2008P@793.78:801.14 COMING IN AT TWELVE THOUSAND MILES PER HOUR AND IN SEVEN MINUTES WE HAVE TO STOP AND TOUCH THE SURFACE VERY SOFTLY SO WE DON'T BREAK
CharlesElachi_2008P@819.80:827.41 MARS SCOUT MISSION IT'S THE FIRST MISSION THAT'S GOING TO TRY TO LAND NEAR THE NORTH POLE OF MARS AND IT'S THE FIRST MISSION THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO TRY AND REACH OUT AND TOUCH WATER ON THE SURFACE OF
CharlesElachi_2008P@828.90:838.12 THERE TENDS TO BE WATER AT LEAST ON EARTH THERE TENDS TO BE LIFE AND SO IT'S POTENTIALLY A PLACE WHERE LIFE COULD HAVE EXISTED ON THE PLANET
CharlesElachi_2008P@844.53:848.65 TAKE A SPACECRAFT THAT IS TRAVELING AT TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MILES
CharlesElachi_2008P@849.08:850.86 AND BRING IT TO A SCREECHING
CharlesElachi_2008P@851.75:853.99 IN A SOFT WAY IN A VERY SHORT
CharlesElachi_2008P@856.81:859.28 WE ENTER THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE WE'RE SEVENTY MILES ABOVE THE SURFACE
CharlesElachi_2008P@859.96:862.50 AND OUR LANDER IS SAFELY TUCKED INSIDE WHAT WE CALL AN
CharlesElachi_2008P@865.66:879.26 THE FRONT OF IT IS THIS HEAT SHIELD THIS SAUCER LOOKING THING THAT HAS ABOUT A HALF INCH OF ESSENTIALLY WHAT'S CORK ON THE FRONT OF IT WHICH IS OUR HEAT SHIELD NOW THIS IS REALLY SPECIAL CORK AND THIS CORK IS WHAT'S GOING TO PROTECT US FROM THE VIOLENT ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY THAT WE'RE ABOUT
CharlesElachi_2008P@886.53:887.89 THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE TO OUR ADVANTAGE TO
CharlesElachi_2008P@889.73:892.25 FROM THIS POINT WE'RE GOING TO DECELERATE FROM TWELVE THOUSAND
CharlesElachi_2008P@910.69:913.86 IS THIS WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY WITHIN WHICH WE CAN
CharlesElachi_2008P@931.54:933.76 A RELATIVELY SLOW TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES
CharlesElachi_2008P@934.49:939.09 WE NO LONGER NEED THE HEAT SHIELD TO PROTECT US FROM THE FORCE OF ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY SO WE JETTISON
CharlesElachi_2008P@943.34:944.30 THE HEAT SHIELD HAS
CharlesElachi_2008P@951.47:953.45 HOW FAR PHOENIX REALLY IS FROM
CharlesElachi_2008P@960.93:964.36 BUT THAT LAST ONE PERCENT AS IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE IS THE TRICKY PART EB NOW
CharlesElachi_2008P@964.90:969.10 SPACECRAFT ACTUALLY HAS TO DECIDE WHEN IT'S GOING TO GET RID OF ITS PARACHUTE BC WE
CharlesElachi_2008P@984.57:985.46 IT'S A VERY SCARY
CharlesElachi_2008P@1002.58:1005.18 RIGHT ITSELF AND THEN SLOWLY SLOW ITSELF
CharlesElachi_2008P@1028.28:1031.09 THE SPACECRAFT SO THAT IT CAN LAND ITSELF SAFELY
CharlesElachi_2008P@1042.74:1044.25 IMMENSELY EXCITING AND CHALLENGING
CharlesElachi_2008P@1062.92:1075.06 SO NOW LET ME TALK ABOUT THE NEXT THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING SO WE ARE IN THE PROCESS AS WE SPEAK OF ACTUALLY DESIGNING THE NEXT ROVER THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE SENDING TO MARS SO I THOUGHT I WOULD GO A LITTLE BIT AND TELL YOU KIND OF THE STEPS WE GO THROUGH IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT
CharlesElachi_2008P@1075.35:1086.90 YOU DO WHEN YOU DESIGN YOUR PRODUCT AS YOU SAW A LITTLE BIT EARLIER WHEN WE WERE DOING THE PHOENIX ONE WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE HEAT THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE FACING SO WE HAVE TO STUDY ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS THE SHAPE THAT WE WANT TO DO
CharlesElachi_2008P@1087.41:1097.55 IN GENERAL WE DON'T TRY TO PLEASE THE CUSTOMER HERE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE AN EFFECTIVE YOU KNOW AN EFFICIENT KIND OF MACHINE FIRST WE START BY WE WANT TO HAVE OUR EMPLOYEES TO BE AS IMAGINATIVE
CharlesElachi_2008P@1113.08:1121.19 ABOUT THINGS WE HAVE A BUNCH OF LEGOS SO AS I SAID THIS IS A PLAYGROUND FOR ADULTS WHERE THEY SIT DOWN AND TRY TO PLAY WITH DIFFERENT SHAPES AND DIFFERENT
CharlesElachi_2008P@1123.43:1132.68 THEN WE GET A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS SO WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL OUR CAD CAMISS AND ALL THE ENGINEERS WHO ARE INVOLVED OR SCIENTISTS WHO ARE INVOLVED WHO KNOW ABOUT THERMAL PROPERTIES KNOW ABOUT DESIGN
CharlesElachi_2008P@1132.98:1143.99 KNOW ABOUT ATMOSPHERIC INTERACTION PARACHUTES ALL OF THESE THINGS WHICH THEY WORK IN A TEAM EFFORT AND ACTUALLY DESIGN A SPACECRAFT IN A COMPUTER TO SOME EXTENT SO TO SEE DOES THAT MEET THE REQUIREMENT
CharlesElachi_2008P@1144.48:1157.24 WE NEED ON THE RIGHT ALSO WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE PLANET WHERE WE ARE GOING IF YOU ARE GOING TO JUPITER YOU HAVE A VERY HIGH RADIATION YOU KNOW ENVIRONMENT IT'S ABOUT THE SAME RADIATION ENVIRONMENT CLOSE BY JUPITER AS INSIDE A NUCLEAR REACTOR
CharlesElachi_2008P@1157.58:1164.33 SO JUST IMAGINE YOU TAKE YOUR PC AND THROW IT INTO A NUCLEAR REACTOR AND IT STILL HAS TO WORK SO THESE ARE KIND OF SOME OF THE LITTLE CHALLENGES
CharlesElachi_2008P@1164.51:1172.40 YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO FACE IF WE ARE DOING ENTRY WE HAVE TO DO TESTS OF PARACHUTES YOU SAW IN THE VIDEO A PARACHUTE BREAKING THAT WOULD BE A BAD DAY
CharlesElachi_2008P@1172.71:1184.55 YOU KNOW IF THAT HAPPENED SO WE HAVE TO TEST BECAUSE WE ARE DEPLOYING THIS PARACHUTE AT SUPERSONIC SPEEDS WE ARE COMING AT EXTREMELY HIGH SPEEDS AND WE ARE DEPLOYING THEM TO SLOW US DOWN SO WE HAVE TO DO ALL KINDS OF TESTS TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE
CharlesElachi_2008P@1185.21:1193.38 YOU KNOW OF THAT PARACHUTE RELATIVE TO THE PEOPLE STANDING THERE NEXT STEP WE GO AND ACTUALLY BUILD SOME KIND OF TEST MODELS AND ACTUALLY TEST THEM YOU KNOW
CharlesElachi_2008P@1194.32:1207.93 IN THE LAB AT JPL IN WHAT WE CALL OUR MARS YARD WE KICK THEM WE HIT THEM WE DROP THEM JUST TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND HOW WHERE WOULD THEY BREAK AND THEN WE BACK OFF YOU KNOW FROM THAT POINT
CharlesElachi_2008P@1208.74:1217.47 AND THEN WE ACTUALLY DO THE ACTUAL BUILDING AND THE FLIGHT AND THIS NEXT ROVER THAT WE'RE FLYING IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A CAR THAT BIG
CharlesElachi_2008P@1218.29:1228.90 THAT YOU SEE OUTSIDE THAT'S A HEAT SHIELD WHICH IS GOING TO PROTECT IT AND THAT WILL BE BASICALLY BUILT OVER THE NEXT YEAR AND IT WILL BE LAUNCHED JUNE A YEAR FROM NOW NOW IN THAT CASE BECAUSE IT WAS A VERY BIG
CharlesElachi_2008P@1229.79:1239.76 ROVER WE COULDN'T USE AIRBAGS AND I KNOW MANY OF YOU KIND OF LAST TIME AFTERWARDS SAID WELL THAT WAS A COOL THING TO HAVE THOSE AIRBAGS UNFORTUNATELY THIS ROVER IS LIKE TEN TIMES THE SIZE OF
CharlesElachi_2008P@1240.16:1246.79 YOU KNOW MASS WISE OF THE OTHER ROVER OR THREE TIMES THE MASS SO WE CAN'T USE AIRBAGS SO WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH ANOTHER INGENIOUS IDEA OF HOW DO WE
CharlesElachi_2008P@1247.58:1255.83 AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE IT PROPULSIVELY ALL THE WAY TO THE SURFACE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO CONTAMINATE THE SURFACE WE WANTED THE ROVER TO IMMEDIATELY LAND ON ITS LEGS
CharlesElachi_2008P@1256.17:1265.12 SO WE CAME UP WITH THIS INGENIOUS IDEA WHICH IS USED HERE ON EARTH FOR HELICOPTERS ACTUALLY THE LANDER WILL COME DOWN TO ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FEET AND HOVER
CharlesElachi_2008P@1265.93:1276.60 ABOVE THAT SURFACE FOR ONE HUNDRED FEET AND THEN WE HAVE A SKY CRANE WHICH WILL TAKE THAT ROVER AND LAND IT DOWN ON THE SURFACE HOPEFULLY IT ALL WILL WORK YOU KNOW IT WILL WORK THAT WAY AND THAT ROVER WILL BE MORE KIND OF LIKE A
CharlesElachi_2008P@1277.30:1285.62 WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BE DOING WITH THAT ROVER AS IT DRIVES AROUND IT'S GOING TO GO AND ANALYZE THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF ROCKS SO IT WILL HAVE AN ARM WHICH WILL TAKE SAMPLES
CharlesElachi_2008P@1285.81:1293.74 PUT THEM IN AN OVEN CRUSH AND ANALYZE THEM BUT ALSO IF THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WE CANNOT REACH BECAUSE IT IS TOO HIGH ON A CLIFF WE HAVE A LITTLE LASER
CharlesElachi_2008P@1303.42:1311.85 STUFF AND ALSO TO HELP YOU TO HELP THE COMMUNITY SO YOU CAN DO ADS ON THAT ROVER WE ARE GOING TO TRAIN THAT ROVER TO ACTUALLY IN ADDITION TO DO THIS
CharlesElachi_2008P@1312.10:1320.31 TO ACTUALLY SERVE COCKTAILS YOU KNOW ALSO ON MARS SO THAT'S KIND OF GIVING YOU AN IDEA OF THE KIND OF YOU KNOW FUN THINGS WE ARE DOING ON MARS I THOUGHT I'D GO TO THE
CharlesElachi_2008P@1320.89:1329.03 LORD OF THE RINGS NOW AND SHOW YOU SOME OF THE THINGS WE HAVE THERE NOW THE LORD OF THE RINGS HAS TWO THINGS PLAYED THROUGH IT ONE IT'S A VERY ATTRACTIVE
CharlesElachi_2008P@1329.78:1340.20 PLANET IT JUST HAS THE BEAUTY OF THE RINGS AND SO ON BUT FOR SCIENTISTS ALSO THE RINGS HAVE A SPECIAL MEANING BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY REPRESENT ON A SMALL SCALE HOW THE SOLAR SYSTEM ACTUALLY
CharlesElachi_2008P@1342.33:1348.45 SOME OF THE SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THE SOLAR SYSTEM FORMED THAT THE SUN WHEN IT COLLAPSED AND ACTUALLY CREATED THE
CharlesElachi_2008P@1349.03:1356.84 A LOT OF THE DUST AROUND IT CREATED RINGS AND THEN THE PARTICLES IN THOSE RINGS ACCUMULATED TOGETHER AND THEY FORMED BIGGER ROCKS AND THEN THAT'S HOW THE PLANETS YOU KNOW
CharlesElachi_2008P@1357.81:1364.92 SO THE IDEA IS BY WATCHING SATURN WE'RE ACTUALLY WATCHING OUR SOLAR SYSTEM IN REAL TIME BEING FORMED ON A SMALLER SCALE SO IT'S LIKE
CharlesElachi_2008P@1365.87:1372.51 IT SO LET ME SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT THAT SATURNIAN SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE FIRST I'M GOING TO FLY YOU
CharlesElachi_2008P@1372.94:1382.55 OVER THE RINGS BY THE WAY ALL OF THIS IS REAL STUFF THIS IS NOT ANIMATION OR ANYTHING LIKE THIS THIS IS ACTUALLY TAKEN FROM THE SATELLITE THAT WE HAVE IN ORBIT AROUND SATURN THE CASSINI
CharlesElachi_2008P@1383.11:1393.84 AND YOU SEE THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL THAT IS IN THOSE RINGS WHICH ARE THE PARTICLES SOME OF THEM ARE ACCUMULATING TOGETHER TO FORM LARGER PARTICLES SO THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THESE GAPS IS BECAUSE A SMALL SATELLITE
CharlesElachi_2008P@1394.14:1403.22 YOU KNOW IS BEING FORMED IN THAT LOCATION NOW YOU THINK THAT THOSE RINGS ARE VERY LARGE OBJECTS YES THEY ARE VERY LARGE IN ONE DIMENSION IN THE OTHER DIMENSION THEY ARE PAPER THIN
CharlesElachi_2008P@1403.67:1417.35 VERY VERY THIN WHAT YOU ARE SEEING HERE IS THE SHADOW OF THE RING ON SATURN ITSELF AND THAT'S ONE OF THE SATELLITES WHICH WAS ACTUALLY FORMED ON THAT ONE SO THINK ABOUT IT AS A PAPER THIN HUGE AREA OF MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES
CharlesElachi_2008P@1417.88:1426.23 WHICH IS ROTATING AND WE HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF KIND OF SATELLITES WHICH WILL FORM EACH ONE LOOKING VERY DIFFERENT AND VERY ODD AND THAT KEEPS SCIENTISTS BUSY FOR
CharlesElachi_2008P@1426.67:1433.49 TENS OF YEARS TRYING TO EXPLAIN THIS AND TELLING NASA WE NEED MORE MONEY SO WE CAN EXPLAIN WHAT THESE THINGS LOOK LIKE OR WHY THEY FORMED THAT WAY
CharlesElachi_2008P@1433.77:1441.38 THERE WERE TWO SATELLITES WHICH WERE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING ONE OF THEM IS CALLED ENCELADUS IT'S A SATELLITE WHICH WAS ALL MADE OF ICE
CharlesElachi_2008P@1441.72:1452.47 AND WE MEASURED IT FROM ORBIT MADE OF ICE BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING BIZARRE ABOUT IT IF YOU LOOK AT THESE STRIPES IN HERE WHAT WE CALL TIGER STRIPES WHEN WE FLEW OVER THEM ALL OF A SUDDEN WE SAW AN INCREASE IN THE TEMPERATURE
CharlesElachi_2008P@1462.21:1471.12 COMING OUT SO THIS IS A YELLOWSTONE YOU KNOW OF SATURN WE ARE SEEING GEYSERS OF ICE WHICH ARE COMING OUT OF THAT PLANET WHICH INDICATE THAT MOST LIKELY THERE IS AN OCEAN
CharlesElachi_2008P@1471.38:1477.08 YOU KNOW BELOW THE SURFACE AND SOMEHOW THROUGH SOME DYNAMIC EFFECT WE'RE HAVING THESE GEYSERS WHICH ARE BEING
CharlesElachi_2008P@1477.77:1489.77 YOU KNOW EMITTED FROM IT AND THE REASON I SHOWED THE LITTLE ARROW THERE I THINK THAT SHOULD SAY THIRTY MILES WE DECIDED A FEW MONTHS AGO TO ACTUALLY FLY THE SPACECRAFT THROUGH THE PLUME OF THAT GEYSER SO WE CAN ACTUALLY MEASURE
CharlesElachi_2008P@1500.24:1513.20 THAT THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF ORGANIC MATERIAL WHICH IS BEING EMITTED IN COMBINATION WITH THE ICE AND OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS WE KEEP ORBITING YOU KNOW SATURN WE ARE PLANNING TO GET CLOSER AND CLOSER DOWN TO THE SURFACE AND MAKE MORE ACCURATE
CharlesElachi_2008P@1513.81:1523.51 NOW ANOTHER SATELLITE ALSO ATTRACTED A LOT OF ATTENTION AND THAT'S TITAN AND THE REASON TITAN IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING IT'S A SATELLITE BIGGER THAN OUR MOON AND IT HAS AN ATMOSPHERE
CharlesElachi_2008P@1523.84:1536.27 AND THAT ATMOSPHERE IS VERY AS DENSE AS OUR OWN ATMOSPHERE SO IF YOU WERE ON TITAN YOU WOULD FEEL THE SAME PRESSURE THAT YOU FEEL IN HERE EXCEPT IT'S A LOT COLDER AND THAT ATMOSPHERE IS HEAVILY MADE OF METHANE
CharlesElachi_2008P@1546.81:1554.18 MATERIAL SO PEOPLE BELIEVE NOW THAT TITAN IS MOST LIKELY WHAT WE CALL A PREBIOTIC PLANET BECAUSE IT'S SO COLD
CharlesElachi_2008P@1563.92:1573.39 THREE BILLION YEARS AGO BEFORE LIFE ACTUALLY STARTED ON IT SO THAT'S GETTING A LOT OF INTEREST AND TO SHOW YOU SOME EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE DID IN THERE WE ACTUALLY DROPPED A PROBE
CharlesElachi_2008P@1583.45:1592.83 DOWN JUST LOOKED LIKE THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA FOR ME YOU SEE THE RIVERS WHICH ARE COMING ALONG THE COAST AND YOU SEE THAT WHITE AREA WHICH LOOKS LIKE CATALINA ISLAND AND THAT LOOKS LIKE AN OCEAN
CharlesElachi_2008P@1593.22:1601.80 AND THEN WITH AN INSTRUMENT WE HAVE ON BOARD A RADAR INSTRUMENT WE FOUND THERE ARE LAKES LIKE THE GREAT LAKES IN HERE SO IT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE EARTH IT LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE RIVERS ON IT
CharlesElachi_2008P@1602.60:1611.92 OCEANS OR LAKES WE KNOW THERE ARE CLOUDS WE THINK IT'S RAINING ALSO ON IT SO IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE THE CYCLE ON EARTH EXCEPT BECAUSE IT'S SO COLD IT COULD NOT BE WATER
