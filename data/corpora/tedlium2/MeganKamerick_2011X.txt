MeganKamerick_2011X@46.81:53.86 WE MAKE UP HALF THE POPULATION OF THE WORLD BUT WE 'RE JUST TWENTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE NEWS SUBJECTS QUOTED IN NEWS STORIES
MeganKamerick_2011X@53.86:72.58 AND WE 'RE JUST TWENTY PERCENT OF THE EXPERTS QUOTED IN STORIES AND NOW WITH TODAY 'S TECHNOLOGY IT 'S POSSIBLE TO REMOVE WOMEN FROM THE PICTURE COMPLETELY THIS IS A PICTURE OF PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA AND HIS ADVISORS TRACKING THE KILLING OF OSAMA BIN LADEN YOU CAN SEE HILLARY CLINTON ON THE RIGHT
MeganKamerick_2011X@115.3:126.02 THE PROBLEM IS OF COURSE THERE AREN 'T ENOUGH WOMEN IN NEWSROOMS THEY REPORTED JUST THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT OF STORIES IN PRINT TV AND RADIO EVEN IN STORIES ON GENDER BASED VIOLENCE
MeganKamerick_2011X@126.18:131.58 MEN GET AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PRINT SPACE AND AIRTIME CASE IN POINT
MeganKamerick_2011X@131.58:145.88 THIS MARCH THE NEW YORK TIMES RAN A STORY BY JAMES MCKINLEY ABOUT A GANG RAPE OF A YOUNG GIRL ELEVEN YEARS OLD IN A SMALL TEXAS TOWN MCKINLEY WRITES THAT THE COMMUNITY 'S WONDERING HOW COULD THEIR BOYS HAVE BEEN DRAWN INTO THIS
MeganKamerick_2011X@145.88:156.41 DRAWN INTO THIS LIKE THEY WERE SEDUCED INTO COMMITTING AN ACT OF VIOLENCE AND THE FIRST PERSON HE QUOTES SAYS THESE BOYS WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITH THIS THE REST OF THEIR LIVES
MeganKamerick_2011X@178.55:193.87 YOUR STORIES ARE CONSTRUCTED AS REPORTERS WE RESEARCH WE INTERVIEW WE TRY TO GIVE A GOOD PICTURE OF REALITY WE ALSO HAVE OUR OWN UNCONSCIOUS BIASES BUT THE TIMES MAKES IT SOUND LIKE ANYONE WOULD HAVE REPORTED THIS STORY THE SAME WAY
MeganKamerick_2011X@194.29:195.87 I DISAGREE WITH THAT
MeganKamerick_2011X@196.17:204.66 SO THREE WEEKS LATER THE TIMES REVISITS THE STORY THIS TIME IT ADDS ANOTHER BYLINE TO IT WITH MCKINLEY 'S ERICA
MeganKamerick_2011X@223.66:227.93 PERHAPS THE ADDITION OF MS GOODE IS WHAT MADE THIS STORY MORE COMPLETE
MeganKamerick_2011X@227.93:235.89 THE GLOBAL MEDIA MONITORING PROJECT HAS FOUND THAT STORIES BY FEMALE REPORTERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO CHALLENGE STEREOTYPES THAN THOSE BY MALE REPORTERS
MeganKamerick_2011X@250.33:257.25 SO FOR HER GRADUATE WORK SHE DID A THREE PART SERIES ON THE MURDER OF ELEVEN WOMEN FOUND BURIED ON ALBUQUERQUE 'S WEST MESA
MeganKamerick_2011X@257.25:274.05 SHE TRIED TO CHALLENGE THOSE PATTERNS AND STEREOTYPES IN HER WORK AND SHE TRIED TO SHOW THE CHALLENGES THAT JOURNALISTS FACE FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES THEIR OWN INTERNAL BIASES AND CULTURAL NORMS AND SHE WORKED WITH AN EDITOR AT NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO TO TRY TO GET A STORY AIRED NATIONALLY
MeganKamerick_2011X@274.05:278.46 SHE 'S NOT SURE THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THE EDITOR HAD NOT BEEN A FEMALE
MeganKamerick_2011X@278.46:288.23 STORIES IN THE NEWS ARE MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY TO PRESENT WOMEN AS VICTIMS THAN MEN AND WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE DEFINED BY THEIR BODY PARTS
MeganKamerick_2011X@322.41:341.4 TEXAS STATE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR CINDY ROYAL WONDERED IN HER BLOG HOW ARE YOUNG WOMEN LIKE HER STUDENTS SUPPOSED TO FEEL ABOUT THEIR ROLES IN TECHNOLOGY READING WIRED CHRIS ANDERSON THE EDITOR OF WIRED DEFENDED HIS CHOICE AND SAID THERE AREN 'T ENOUGH WOMEN PROMINENT WOMEN IN TECHNOLOGY TO SELL A COVER TO SELL AN ISSUE
MeganKamerick_2011X@341.4:355.31 PART OF THAT IS TRUE THERE AREN 'T AS MANY PROMINENT WOMEN IN TECHNOLOGY HERE 'S MY PROBLEM WITH THAT ARGUMENT MEDIA TELLS US EVERY DAY WHAT 'S IMPORTANT BY THE STORIES THEY CHOOSE AND WHERE THEY PLACE THEM IT 'S CALLED AGENDA SETTING
MeganKamerick_2011X@387.85:391.4 BY THE WAY APPARENTLY WIRED TOOK ALL THIS TO HEART
MeganKamerick_2011X@391.51:400.73 THIS WAS ITS ISSUE IN APRIL LAUGHTER THAT 'S LIMOR FRIED THE FOUNDER OF ADAFRUIT INDUSTRIES IN THE ROSIE THE RIVETER POSE
MeganKamerick_2011X@400.73:416.74 IT WOULD HELP TO HAVE MORE WOMEN IN POSITIONS OF LEADERSHIP IN THE MEDIA A RECENT GLOBAL SURVEY FOUND THAT SEVENTY THREE PERCENT OF THE TOP MEDIA MANAGEMENT JOBS ARE STILL HELD BY MEN BUT THIS IS ALSO ABOUT SOMETHING FAR MORE COMPLEX OUR OWN UNCONSCIOUS BIASES AND BLIND SPOTS
MeganKamerick_2011X@416.74:424.51 SHANKAR VEDANTAM IS THE AUTHOR OF THE HIDDEN BRAIN HOW OUR UNCONSCIOUS MINDS ELECT PRESIDENTS CONTROL MARKETS WAGE WARS AND SAVE OUR LIVES
MeganKamerick_2011X@438.18:446.9 BUT HE DID HAVE ONE SUGGESTION HE USED TO WORK FOR TWO EDITORS WHO SAID EVERY STORY HAD TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE FEMALE SOURCE
MeganKamerick_2011X@460.03:474.33 THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS WON A PULITZER PRIZE IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR FOR A SERIES IT DID ON WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD BUT ONE OF THE REPORTERS TOLD ME SHE 'S CONVINCED IT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY HAD NOT HAD A FEMALE ASSISTANT FOREIGN EDITOR
MeganKamerick_2011X@474.33:485.11 AND THEY WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN SOME OF THOSE STORIES WITHOUT FEMALE REPORTERS AND EDITORS ON THE GROUND PARTICULARLY ONE ON FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION MEN WOULD JUST NOT BE ALLOWED INTO THOSE SITUATIONS
MeganKamerick_2011X@485.11:495.69 THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT TO CONSIDER BECAUSE MUCH OF OUR FOREIGN POLICY NOW REVOLVES AROUND COUNTRIES WHERE THE TREATMENT OF WOMEN IS AN ISSUE SUCH AS AFGHANISTAN
MeganKamerick_2011X@495.69:504.39 WHAT WE 'RE TOLD IN TERMS OF ARGUMENTS AGAINST LEAVING THIS COUNTRY IS THAT THE FATE OF THE WOMEN IS PRIMARY
MeganKamerick_2011X@504.39:515.42 NOW I 'M SURE A MALE REPORTER IN KABUL CAN FIND WOMEN TO INTERVIEW NOT SO SURE ABOUT RURAL TRADITIONAL AREAS WHERE I 'M GUESSING WOMEN CAN 'T TALK TO STRANGE MEN
MeganKamerick_2011X@515.93:519.94 IT 'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS IN LIGHT OF LARA LOGAN
MeganKamerick_2011X@519.94:536.44 SHE WAS THE CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT WHO WAS BRUTALLY SEXUALLY ASSAULTED IN EGYPT 'S TAHRIR SQUARE RIGHT AFTER THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY PUNDITS WEIGHED IN BLAMING HER AND SAYING THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW MAYBE WOMEN SHOULDN 'T BE SENT TO COVER THOSE STORIES
MeganKamerick_2011X@536.44:543.23 I NEVER HEARD ANYONE SAY THIS ABOUT ANDERSON COOPER AND HIS CREW WHO WERE ATTACKED COVERING THE SAME STORY
MeganKamerick_2011X@557.28:564.48 BUT THIS IS NOT JUST A JOB FOR SUPER JOURNALISTS OR MY ORGANIZATION YOU ALL HAVE A STAKE IN A STRONG VIBRANT MEDIA
MeganKamerick_2011X@574.45:592.25 REMEMBER A COMPLETE PICTURE OF REALITY MAY DEPEND UPON IT AND I 'LL LEAVE YOU WITH A VIDEO CLIP THAT I FIRST SAW IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN WHEN I WAS A STUDENT IN LONDON IT 'S FOR THE GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER IT 'S ACTUALLY LONG BEFORE I EVER THOUGHT ABOUT BECOMING A JOURNALIST BUT I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN HOW WE LEARN TO PERCEIVE OUR WORLD
MeganKamerick_2011X@602.95:615.23 SEEN FROM ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW IT GIVES QUITE A DIFFERENT IMPRESSION BUT IT 'S ONLY WHEN YOU GET THE WHOLE PICTURE YOU CAN FULLY UNDERSTAND
