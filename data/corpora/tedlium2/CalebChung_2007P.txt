CalebChung_2007P YOU KNOW YOU TO FIND INNOVATION AND I TRIED TO SUM THIS UP IN SOME KIND OF SYMBOL THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO ME ANYWAY AND SO ART AND SCIENCE HAVE A KIND OF DYNAMIC BALANCE THAT'S WHERE I THINK INNOVATION HAPPENS AND ACTUALLY THIS IS TO ME HOW I
CalebChung_2007P CAN COME UP WITH GREAT IDEAS BUT IT'S NOT HOW YOU ACTUALLY GET LEVERAGE ACTUALLY YOU HAVE TO PUT A CIRCLE AROUND THAT AND CALL IT BUSINESS AND THOSE THREE TOGETHER I THINK GIVE YOU LEVERAGE IN THE WORLD BUT MOVING ON SO THIS IS A QUICK TALE I'M GOING TO TELL THIS IS THE FURBY TALE
CalebChung_2007P AS HE SAID I WAS CO INVENTOR OF THE FURBY I DID THE BODY AND CREATURE WELL YOU'LL SEE SO BY WAY OF SHOWING YOU THIS YOU CAN KIND OF GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT IS TO HOPEFULLY TRY TO CREATE
CalebChung_2007P ROBOTIC LIFE FORMS OR TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH THE USER SO THIS IS MY FAMILY
CalebChung_2007P THIS IS MY WIFE CHRISTI AND ABBY AND MELISSA AND MY SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD NOW EMILY WHO WAS JUST A PACK OF TROUBLE ALL RIGHT THERE 'S THERE'S THAT ROBOT AGAIN I CAME OUT OF THE MOVIE BUSINESS AS I SAID AND I SAID LET 'S MAKE THESE ANIMATRONIC ROBOTS LET 'S MAKE THESE THINGS

CalebChung_2007P FEWEST PIECES WE COULD USE TO MAKE A LITTLE LIFE FORM AND THAT'S OUR LITTLE THIRTY CENT MABUCHI MOTOR AND SO I HAVE ALL THESE DESIGN BOOKS LIKE I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE AND THROUGHOUT THE BOOKS THIS IS THE FIRST PAGE ON FURBY I HAVE KIND OF THE ART AND SCIENCE I HAVE THE
CalebChung_2007P OVER HERE AND THE HOW OVER THERE I TRY TO DO A LOT OF PHILOSOPHY A LOT OF THINKING ABOUT ALL OF THESE PROJECTS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT JUST BING IDEAS YOU HAVE TO REALLY DIG DEEP
CalebChung_2007P THAT TURNED OUT TO BE A LITTLE MORE THAN TRUE THERE'S MY FIRST EXPLODED VIEW AND ALL THE LITTLE PIECES AND THE LITTLE WORM DRIVE AND ALL THAT STUFF
CalebChung_2007P THE LITTLE BB IN THE BOX IS MY TILT SENSOR I JUST BASICALLY GNAWED ALL THIS STUFF OUT OF PLASTIC
CalebChung_2007P SO THERE'S THE BACK OF HIS HEAD WITH A BILLION HOLES IN IT AND THERE I AM I'M DONE THERE'S MY LITTLE FURBY NO IT'S A LITTLE ROBOT ON HEROIN OR SOMETHING I THINK
CalebChung_2007P RIGHT NOW YOU SEE I LOVE LITTLE ROBOTS SO MY WIFE SAYS WELL YOU MAY LIKE IT BUT NOBODY ELSE WILL SO SHE COMES TO THE RESCUE THIS IS MY WIFE CHRISTI WHO IS JUST YOU KNOW
CalebChung_2007P SO HERE 'S A LITTLE PINK ONE A LITTLE POUF ON HIS HEAD AND HERE 'S THIS DIDN'T DO SO WELL IN TESTING EITHER I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE'S MY FAVORITE DEMON FURBY THAT WAS A GOOD ONE
CalebChung_2007P AND SINCE THEN EVERY TIME I COME HOME FROM TOYS R US WITH DOLLS OR SOMETHING THEY DISAPPEAR FROM MY DESK AND THEY GET HIDDEN IN THE HOUSE I HAVE THREE GIRLS AND THEY JUST THEY IT'S LIKE A RESCUE ANIMAL THING THEY'RE GOING
CalebChung_2007P LITTLE TETHER COMING OFF IT'S JUST A CONTROL FOR THE FUR 'S MOUTH AND HIS EYES IT'S JUST A LITTLE SERVER CONTROL AND I MADE A
CalebChung_2007P AND THAT'S HOW WE SOLD HIM AND HASBRO ACTUALLY SAID I MEANT TIGER ELECTRONICS AT THE TIME SAID YEAH WE WANT TO DO THIS WE HAVE YOU KNOW
CalebChung_2007P RAN THE PARTS FOR THAT SO THIS IS HOW THEY COME OUT CLOSE TO THE END AND THEN THEY LOOKED LIKE LITTLE GARFIELDS THERE EIGHT MONTHS LATER YOU MAY REMEMBER THIS THIS WAS A
CalebChung_2007P TOTAL TOTAL TOTAL CHAOS FOR A WHILE THEY WERE MAKING TWO MILLION FURBYS A MONTH THEY ACTUALLY WOUND UP DOING ABOUT FORTY MILLION FURBYS I IT'S UNBELIEVABLE HOW
CalebChung_2007P I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT CAN BE AND HASBRO MADE ABOUT YOU KNOW A BILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS
CalebChung_2007P SO
CalebChung_2007P FULL CIRCLE WHY DO I DO THIS WHY DO YOU YOU KNOW TRY TO DO THIS STUFF AND IT'S OF COURSE FOR YOUR KIDS AND THERE'S MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER WITH HER FURBYS AND SHE STILL ACTUALLY HAS THOSE SO I KIND OF RETIRED AND WE'RE ALREADY LIVING IN PARADISE UP IN BOISE ON A RIVER YOU KNOW
CalebChung_2007P AND THEN I STARTED ANOTHER COMPANY CALLED TOY INNOVATION AND WE DID SOME PROJECTS WITH MATTEL WITH A ACTUALLY WITH A LADY WHO 'S HERE IVY ROSS AND
CalebChung_2007P MOVES BABY MADE IT IN WIRED MAGAZINE DID A BUNCH OF OTHER STUFF AND THEN I STARTED ANOTHER COMPANY WE DID A LITTLE
CalebChung_2007P GUY SAW IT AND THEN PEOPLE STARTED TO WANT TO DO IT AND THEY SAID THEY'D SPEND ALL THIS TIME SO I SAID OK LET 'S TRY TO DO THIS DINOSAUR PROJECT THE CRAZY IDEA IS WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO
CalebChung_2007P A DINOSAUR AS MUCH AS WE CAN WITH TODAY 'S TECHNOLOGY AND IT'S NOT REALLY BUT AS CLOSE AS WE CAN DO AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO REALLY
CalebChung_2007P PULL THIS OFF INTENTFULLY TRY TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ALIVE NOT A ROBOT THAT KIND OF DOES BUT LET 'S REALLY GO FOR IT
CalebChung_2007P SO I PICKED A CAMARASAURUS BECAUSE THE CAMARASAURUS WAS THE MOST ABUNDANT OF THE SAUROPODS IN NORTH AMERICA AND YOU COULD ACTUALLY FIND FULL FOSSIL EVIDENCE OF THESE THAT'S A JUVENILE AND SO WE ACTUALLY WENT IN THERE'S A BOOK
CalebChung_2007P VERY VERY OBSESSIVE THERE'S A KIND OF TRUNCATED CAMARASAURUS SKELETON BUT THE GEOMETRY 'S CORRECT AND THEN I WENT IN AND MEASURED ALL THE GEOMETRY BECAUSE
CalebChung_2007P I FIGURED HEY BIOMIMICRY IF I DO IT KIND OF RIGHT IT MIGHT MOVE KIND OF LIKE THE REAL THING SO THERE'S THE MOTOR AND ABOUT THIS TIME YOU KNOW ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO HELP HERE 'S AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE DID WITH THE SKULL THERE'S THE SKULL
CalebChung_2007P THERE'S SOME SOLID WORKS VERSIONS OF IT HERE 'S SOME SLA PARTS OF THE SAME THING AND THEN THESE ARE REALLY CRUDE PIECES WE WERE JUST DOING SOME TESTS HERE THERE'S THE SKULL PRETTY MUCH THE SAME SHAPE AS THE CAMARASAURUS THERE'S A
CalebChung_2007P PHOTO REALISTIC EYE BEHIND A LENS AND THERE'S KIND OF THE FIRST EXPLODED VIEW OR SEE THROUGH VIEW THERE'S THE FIRST SLA VERSION AND IT ALREADY KIND OF HAS THE FEEL IT HAS KIND OF A CUTENESS ALREADY
CalebChung_2007P AND THE THING ABOUT BLENDING SCIENCE AND ART IN THIS MULTIDISCIPLINARY STUFF IS YOU CAN DO A ROBOT AND THEN YOU GO BACK AND DO THE SHAPE AND THEN YOU GO BACK AND FORTH THE SERVOS IN THE FRONT LEGS WE HAD TO SHAPE THOSE LIKE MUSCLES THEY HAD TO FIT WITHIN THE
CalebChung_2007P A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK TO GET ALL THAT WORKING RIGHT ALL THE NECK AND THE TAIL ARE CABLE SO IT MOVES SMOOTHLY AND ORGANICALLY AND THEN OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT DONE YET YOU HAVE TO GET THE LOOK FOR THE SKIN THE SKIN 'S A WHOLE ANOTHER THING PROBABLY THE HARDEST PART
CalebChung_2007P SO YOU HIRE ARTISTS AND YOU TRY TO GET THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE CHARACTER NOW THIS IS NOT WITH CHARACTER DESIGNERS RIGHT
CalebChung_2007P AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO KEEP WITH THE REAL CHARACTER SO NOW YOU GO BACK AND YOU COVER THE WHOLE THING WITH CLAY NOW YOU START DOING THE SCULPTURE FOR THIS AND YOU CAN SEE WE GOT A GUY FROM WHO 'S JUST
