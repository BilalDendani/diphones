EllenJorgensen_2012G TIME TO BE A MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST
EllenJorgensen_2012G IT 'S A MOVEMENT THAT IT ADVOCATES MAKING BIOTECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE
EllenJorgensen_2012G NOT JUST SCIENTISTS AND PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT LABS THE IDEA IS THAT IF YOU OPEN UP THE SCIENCE AND YOU ALLOW DIVERSE GROUPS TO PARTICIPATE IT COULD REALLY STIMULATE INNOVATION PUTTING TECHNOLOGY IN THE HANDS OF THE END USER IS USUALLY A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THEY 'VE GOT THE BEST IDEA OF WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE
EllenJorgensen_2012G AND HERE 'S THIS REALLY SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY COMING DOWN THE ROAD ALL THESE ASSOCIATED SOCIAL MORAL
EllenJorgensen_2012G SO
EllenJorgensen_2012G SO THREE YEARS AGO I GOT TOGETHER WITH SOME FRIENDS OF MINE WHO HAD SIMILAR ASPIRATIONS AND WE FOUNDED GENSPACE IT 'S A NONPROFIT A COMMUNITY BIOTECH LAB
EllenJorgensen_2012G AND PUTTER AROUND IN THE LAB
EllenJorgensen_2012G IN A VERY OPEN FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE
EllenJorgensen_2012G NONE OF MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE PREPARED ME FOR WHAT CAME NEXT CAN YOU GUESS THE PRESS STARTED CALLING US AND THE MORE WE TALKED ABOUT HOW GREAT IT WAS TO INCREASE SCIENCE LITERACY THE MORE THEY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT US CREATING THE NEXT FRANKENSTEIN AND AS A RESULT
EllenJorgensen_2012G FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS WHEN YOU GOOGLED MY NAME INSTEAD OF GETTING MY SCIENTIFIC PAPERS YOU GOT THIS
EllenJorgensen_2012G IT WAS PRETTY DEPRESSING THE ONLY THING THAT GOT US THROUGH THAT PERIOD WAS THAT WE KNEW THAT ALL OVER THE WORLD THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING THAT WE WERE
EllenJorgensen_2012G GLOBAL COMMUNITY OF HACKERSPACES AND THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING THESE ARE SOME OF THE BIGGEST ONES AND THERE ARE OTHERS OPENING EVERY DAY THERE 'S ONE PROBABLY GOING TO OPEN UP IN MOSCOW ONE IN SOUTH KOREA
EllenJorgensen_2012G AND THE COOL THING IS THEY EACH HAVE THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL FLAVOR THAT GREW OUT OF THE COMMUNITY THEY CAME OUT OF
EllenJorgensen_2012G LET ME TAKE YOU ON A LITTLE TOUR BIOHACKERS WORK ALONE WE WORK IN GROUPS IN BIG CITIES LAUGHTER AND IN SMALL VILLAGES WE REVERSE ENGINEER LAB
EllenJorgensen_2012G TO TAKE THINGS APART WE MAKE THINGS GROW
EllenJorgensen_2012G WE MAKE THINGS GLOW AND WE MAKE CELLS DANCE
EllenJorgensen_2012G IS BIO SAFETY BIO SECURITY
EllenJorgensen_2012G IT REALLY COMPELS YOU YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT BOTH THE AMATEUR GROUPS BUT ALSO THE PROFESSIONAL GROUPS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE THEY HAVE BETTER FACILITIES AND THEY HAVE ACCESS TO PATHOGENS
EllenJorgensen_2012G SO THE UNITED NATIONS DID JUST THAT AND THEY RECENTLY ISSUED A REPORT ON THIS WHOLE AREA
EllenJorgensen_2012G AND WHAT THEY CONCLUDED WAS THE POWER OF THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR POSITIVE WAS MUCH GREATER THAN THE RISK FOR NEGATIVE AND THEY EVEN LOOKED SPECIFICALLY AT THE DIYBIO COMMUNITY
EllenJorgensen_2012G AND THEY NOTED NOT SURPRISINGLY THAT THE PRESS HAD A TENDENCY TO CONSISTENTLY OVERESTIMATE OUR CAPABILITIES AND UNDERESTIMATE OUR ETHICS
EllenJorgensen_2012G AS A MATTER OF FACT DIY PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD AMERICA EUROPE GOT TOGETHER LAST YEAR AND WE HAMMERED OUT A COMMON CODE OF ETHICS THAT 'S A LOT MORE THAN CONVENTIONAL SCIENCE HAS DONE NOW
EllenJorgensen_2012G WE FOLLOW STATE AND LOCAL REGULATIONS WE DISPOSE OF OUR WASTE PROPERLY WE FOLLOW SAFETY PROCEDURES WE DON 'T WORK WITH PATHOGENS YOU KNOW IF YOU 'RE WORKING WITH A PATHOGEN YOU 'RE NOT PART OF THE BIOHACKER COMMUNITY
EllenJorgensen_2012G THAT 'S LITERALLY ABOUT AS PROBABLE AS A SNOWSTORM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SAHARA DESERT NOW IT COULD
EllenJorgensen_2012G BUT I 'M NOT GOING TO PLAN MY LIFE AROUND IT
EllenJorgensen_2012G I
EllenJorgensen_2012G ACTUALLY CHOSEN TO TAKE A DIFFERENT KIND OF RISK
EllenJorgensen_2012G I SIGNED UP FOR SOMETHING CALLED THE PERSONAL GENOME PROJECT IT 'S A STUDY AT HARVARD WHERE AT THE END OF THE STUDY THEY 'RE GOING TO TAKE MY ENTIRE GENOMIC SEQUENCE ALL OF MY MEDICAL INFORMATION AND MY IDENTITY AND THEY 'RE GOING TO POST IT ONLINE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE
EllenJorgensen_2012G THERE WERE A LOT OF RISKS INVOLVED THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT DURING THE INFORMED CONSENT PORTION THE ONE I LIKED THE BEST
EllenJorgensen_2012G IS SOMEONE COULD DOWNLOAD MY SEQUENCE GO BACK TO THE LAB SYNTHESIZE SOME FAKE ELLEN DNA AND PLANT IT AT A CRIME SCENE
EllenJorgensen_2012G NOW YOU MIGHT BE ASKING YOURSELF WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD I DO IN A BIOLAB
EllenJorgensen_2012G WELL IT WASN 'T THAT LONG AGO WE WERE ASKING WELL WHAT WOULD ANYONE DO WITH A PERSONAL COMPUTER SO THIS STUFF IS JUST BEGINNING
EllenJorgensen_2012G HE THREW TENNIS BALLS TO ALL THE NEIGHBORHOOD DOGS
EllenJorgensen_2012G INVASIVE SPECIES IN MY OWN
EllenJorgensen_2012G IN A BIOHACKER SPACE YOU CAN ANALYZE YOUR GENOME FOR MUTATIONS YOU CAN ANALYZE YOUR BREAKFAST CEREAL FOR GMO 'S AND YOU CAN EXPLORE YOUR ANCESTRY YOU CAN SEND WEATHER BALLOONS UP INTO THE STRATOSPHERE COLLECT MICROBES SEE WHAT 'S UP
EllenJorgensen_2012G YOU CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN ALSO DO AN ART SCIENCE PROJECT SOME OF THESE ARE REALLY SPECTACULAR AND THEY LOOK AT SOCIAL ECOLOGICAL PROBLEMS FROM A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE IT 'S REALLY COOL SOME PEOPLE ASK ME WELL WHY
EllenJorgensen_2012G THERE 'S SOMETHING SACRED ABOUT A SPACE WHERE YOU CAN WORK ON A PROJECT AND YOU DON 'T HAVE TO JUSTIFY TO ANYONE THAT IT 'S GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY THAT IT 'S GOING TO SAVE MANKIND OR EVEN THAT IT 'S FEASIBLE IT JUST HAS TO FOLLOW SAFETY GUIDELINES
EllenJorgensen_2012G WHO KNOWS WHAT WE COULD DO THIS IS SUCH A NEW AREA AND AS WE SAY BACK
