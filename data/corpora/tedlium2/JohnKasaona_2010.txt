JohnKasaona_2010 AND
JohnKasaona_2010 HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR A MAN WITH SO MUCH TIME TO TELL HIS STORY IN EIGHTEEN MINUTES I THINK IT WILL BE QUITE A CHALLENGE FOR ME
JohnKasaona_2010 THESE DAYS THEY TALK ABOUT FAMINE HIV AND
JohnKasaona_2010 MY STORY THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY IS THE ONE ABOUT SUCCESS
JohnKasaona_2010 IT IS ABOUT A COUNTRY IN THE SOUTHWEST OF AFRICA
JohnKasaona_2010 HAS GOT TWO POINT ONE MILLION PEOPLE
JohnKasaona_2010 BUT IT IS ONLY TWICE THE SIZE OF
JohnKasaona_2010 I COME FROM
JohnKasaona_2010 IN THE REMOTE NORTHWEST PART OF THE COUNTRY IT'S CALLED KUNENE REGION
JohnKasaona_2010 AND IN THE CENTER OF KUNENE REGION IS THE VILLAGE OF SESFONTAIN THIS IS WHERE I WAS BORN THIS IS WHERE I'M COMING FROM
JohnKasaona_2010 MOST PEOPLE THAT ARE FOLLOWING
JohnKasaona_2010 AND BRAD PITT WILL
JohnKasaona_2010 THEY LOVE NAMIBIA FOR ITS BEAUTIFUL DUNES
JohnKasaona_2010 THAT ARE EVEN TALLER THAN THE
JohnKasaona_2010 AND TIME HAVE
JohnKasaona_2010 VERY STRANGE SHAPES
JohnKasaona_2010 TO THIS
JohnKasaona_2010 A HIMBA
JohnKasaona_2010 YOU MIGHT WONDER WHY ARE YOU WEARING THESE WESTERN CLOTHES I'M A HIMBA AND NAMIBIAN A HIMBA IS ONE OF THE TWENTY NINE ETHNIC GROUPS IN NAMIBIA
JohnKasaona_2010 WE LIVE
JohnKasaona_2010 I GREW UP HERDING LOOKING AFTER OUR LIVESTOCK GOATS SHEEP AND CATTLE
JohnKasaona_2010 AND ONE
JohnKasaona_2010 MY FATHER ACTUALLY TOOK ME INTO THE BUSH HE SAID
JohnKasaona_2010 I WANT YOU TO BECOME
JohnKasaona_2010 JUST WALK UP TO IT
JohnKasaona_2010 AND SMACK IT ON THE
JohnKasaona_2010 AND HE WILL LET GO OF THE GOAT AND
JohnKasaona_2010 MAY NOT
JohnKasaona_2010 THEN HE SAID IF YOU SEE A
JohnKasaona_2010 YOU
JohnKasaona_2010 IN THIS WAY I ACTUALLY STARTED TO LEARN ABOUT
JohnKasaona_2010 IN ADDITION TO BEING A HIMBA I'M ALSO
JohnKasaona_2010 AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT
JohnKasaona_2010 AND HUNT AS THEY WISHED BUT WE BLACK WE WERE NOT
JohnKasaona_2010 TO USE WILDLIFE WHENEVER WE TRIED TO
JohnKasaona_2010 WE WERE CALLED
JohnKasaona_2010 AND AS A RESULT WE WERE FINED AND LOCKED UP
JohnKasaona_2010 FOR CONTROL OVER MY COUNTRY AND
JohnKasaona_2010 YOU KNOW DURING WAR TIME THERE ARE MILITARIES ARMIES THAT
JohnKasaona_2010 AND THE
JohnKasaona_2010 AND TUSKS AND THEY COULD SELL THESE THINGS FOR ANYTHING
JohnKasaona_2010 THE SAME YEAR ALMOST EVERY HIMBA HAD
JohnKasaona_2010 WAS ALMOST AT THE
JohnKasaona_2010 WHEN
JohnKasaona_2010 WENT INTO THE HOUSE OF ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS AND TOOK HIS SLEEPING CHILD OUT OF
JohnKasaona_2010 EVEN TODAY THAT MEMORY IS STILL IN PEOPLE 'S MIND THEY CAN PINPOINT THE EXACT LOCATION WHERE THIS ALL HAPPENED
JohnKasaona_2010 YOU JUST GO TO SCHOOL AND THEY SENT ME OFF TO SCHOOL JUST TO GET BUSY SOMEWHERE THERE AND THE YEAR I WENT TO SCHOOL
JohnKasaona_2010 ACTUALLY GOT A JOB WITH A NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION CALLED IRDNC INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND NATURE CONSERVATION
JohnKasaona_2010 THEY ACTUALLY SPEND A LOT OF
JohnKasaona_2010 A YEAR IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY WERE TRUSTED BY THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES LIKE
JohnKasaona_2010 DESPAIR SURROUNDED JOSHUA AND
JohnKasaona_2010 THEN THE PEOPLE FROM IRDNC PROPOSED TO
JohnKasaona_2010 DO YOU HAVE ANYBODY IN YOUR COMMUNITIES OR PEOPLE
JohnKasaona_2010 THAT KNOW THE BUSH VERY WELL
JohnKasaona_2010 AND THAT
JohnKasaona_2010 DOING ELSEWHERE
JohnKasaona_2010 HAS HELPED
JohnKasaona_2010 AS PEOPLE STARTED FEELING OWNERSHIP
JohnKasaona_2010 STARTED COMING BACK AND THAT'S ACTUALLY BECOMING A FOUNDATION FOR CONSERVATION IN NAMIBIA
JohnKasaona_2010 WITH INDEPENDENCE THE WHOLE APPROACH OF COMMUNITY GETTING INVOLVED WAS EMBRACED BY
JohnKasaona_2010 THAT ACTUALLY HELP
JohnKasaona_2010 TO BUILD ON THIS FOUNDATION THE VERY FIRST ONE
JohnKasaona_2010 AND BEING OPEN TO NEW
JohnKasaona_2010 AT EVERY HIMBA
JohnKasaona_2010 AND AT THIS SACRED FIRE THE
JohnKasaona_2010 SPEAK THROUGH THE HEADMAN AND ADVISE US WHERE TO GET WATER WHERE TO GET GRAZINGS AND WHERE TO GO
JohnKasaona_2010 AND I THINK THIS IS THE BEST WAY
JohnKasaona_2010 THE ENVIRONMENT
JohnKasaona_2010 AND HERE ARE THE NEW
JohnKasaona_2010 USING
JohnKasaona_2010 I THINK IS MUCH EASIER THAN TALKING THROUGH A SPIRIT THAT YOU CAN'T SEE ISN'T IT AND THESE THINGS WE WERE TAUGHT BY OUTSIDERS WE LEARNED THESE THINGS FROM
JohnKasaona_2010 WE NEEDED NEW BOUNDARIES TO DESCRIBE OUR TRADITIONAL LANDS
JohnKasaona_2010 WE NEEDED TO LEARN MORE THINGS LIKE GPS JUST TO SEE WHETHER
JohnKasaona_2010 CAN GPS REALLY REFLECT THE TRUE REFLECTION OF THE LAND OR IS THIS JUST A THING MADE SOMEWHERE IN THE WEST AND WE THEN WANTED TO SEE WHETHER WE CAN MATCH OUR ANCESTRAL MAPS WITH DIGITAL MAPS MADE SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD
JohnKasaona_2010 WE ACTUALLY STARTED REALIZING OUR DREAMS
JohnKasaona_2010 AND WE MAINTAINED HONORING OUR TRADITIONS BUT WE WERE STILL OPEN TO NEW IDEAS
JohnKasaona_2010 THE SECOND ELEMENT IS THAT WE WANTED TO HAVE A LIFE
JohnKasaona_2010 WE CAN BENEFIT THROUGH MANY THINGS MOST POACHERS
JohnKasaona_2010 LIKE MY FATHER
JohnKasaona_2010 OUR OWN PEOPLE
JohnKasaona_2010 AND SOMETIMES ONCE THEY WERE CAUGHT
JohnKasaona_2010 THEY
JohnKasaona_2010 BROUGHT BACK INTO THE COMMUNITIES AND THEY WERE MADE PART OF THE
JohnKasaona_2010 THEY WERE PUT IN CHARGE TO STOP OTHERS FROM
JohnKasaona_2010 WHEN THIS THING STARTED GOING ON WE STARTED BECOMING ONE COMMUNITY WE KNEW OUR CONNECTION TO NATURE AND THAT WAS A VERY VERY STRONG THING IN NAMIBIA
JohnKasaona_2010 THE LAST ELEMENT THAT ACTUALLY HELPED DEVELOP THESE THINGS WAS THE
JohnKasaona_2010 GIVEN LEGAL STATUS OVER
JohnKasaona_2010 THE OTHER PARTNERS THAT WE HAVE GOT IS BUSINESS COMMUNITIES
JohnKasaona_2010 BRING NAMIBIA ONTO THE WORLD
JohnKasaona_2010 AND THEY HAVE ALSO HELPED
JohnKasaona_2010 AND MOST OF MY CONSERVATION COLLEAGUES TODAY THAT YOU FIND IN NAMIBIA HAVE BEEN TRAINED
JohnKasaona_2010 THROUGH THE INITIATIVE THROUGH THE INVOLVEMENT OF WORLD WILDLIFE
JohnKasaona_2010 IN THE MOST UP TO DATE CONSERVATION PRACTICES THEY HAVE ALSO GIVEN FUNDING FOR TWO DECADES TO THIS WHOLE PROGRAM AND SO FAR WITH THE SUPPORT OF WORLD WILDLIFE FUND
JohnKasaona_2010 BEEN ABLE TO SCALE UP THE VERY SMALL PROGRAMS TO NATIONAL PROGRAMS
JohnKasaona_2010 WAS NO MORE AN ISOLATED VILLAGE SOMEWHERE HIDDEN AWAY IN
JohnKasaona_2010 WE ARE NOW PART OF THE GLOBAL VILLAGE
JohnKasaona_2010 SINCE MY FATHER 'S FIRST JOB AS A COMMUNITY GAME GUARD IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT HE PASSED AWAY
JohnKasaona_2010 AND HE CANNOT SEE THE
JohnKasaona_2010 AS I
JohnKasaona_2010 TWENTY LIONS IN THE
JohnKasaona_2010 ONE HUNDRED AND
JohnKasaona_2010 IN THE WORLD THIS IS OUTSIDE THE
JohnKasaona_2010 NOW IN BIG NUMBERS BUT THEY ARE NOW FAR AWAY FROM OUR VILLAGE BECAUSE THE NATURAL PLAIN HAS
JohnKasaona_2010 AND EVERYTHING THEY
JohnKasaona_2010 THIS OTHER THING HAS MULTIPLIED FROM
JohnKasaona_2010 OF ANIMALS
JohnKasaona_2010 AND WHAT STARTED AS VERY SMALL COMMUNITY RANGERS GETTING COMMUNITY INVOLVED
JohnKasaona_2010 HAS NOW
JohnKasaona_2010 INSTITUTED INSTITUTIONS
JohnKasaona_2010 AND THESE ARE RUN BY THE COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES FOR THEIR BENEFIT TODAY WE HAVE GOT SIXTY
JohnKasaona_2010 THAT MANAGE AND PROTECT OVER THIRTEEN MILLION HECTARES OF LAND IN NAMIBIA
JohnKasaona_2010 WE HAVE
JohnKasaona_2010 IN THE WORLD HAS COMMUNITY
JohnKasaona_2010 IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT CONSERVANCY GENERATED FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS
JohnKasaona_2010 THIS IS
JohnKasaona_2010 BASED ON THE RESPECT OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AND WE ARE ABLE TO USE THIS MONEY FOR MANY THINGS
JohnKasaona_2010 VERY IMPORTANT
JohnKasaona_2010 WE INVEST THIS MONEY IN AIDS AND HIV EDUCATION YOU KNOW THAT AFRICA IS BEING AFFECTED BY
JohnKasaona_2010 AND THIS IS THE GOOD NEWS FROM AFRICA THAT WE HAVE TO SHOUT FROM THE
JohnKasaona_2010 HELP ME AND OUR PARTNERS
JohnKasaona_2010 GREAT PLAINS
JohnKasaona_2010 WHERE BUFFALO AND OTHER ANIMALS HAVE SUFFERED
JohnKasaona_2010 AND MANY COMMUNITIES ARE IN DECLINE
JohnKasaona_2010 THAT
JohnKasaona_2010 AND AFRICA SERVING AS A MODEL TO THE UNITED STATES
JohnKasaona_2010 WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN NAMIBIA BECAUSE
JohnKasaona_2010 WE
JohnKasaona_2010 MUCH MORE THAN JUST A HEALTHY
