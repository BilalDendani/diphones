StefonHarris_2011S I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE 'RE GOING TO PLAY I WON 'T BE ABLE TO TELL YOU WHAT IT IS UNTIL IT HAPPENS I DIDN 'T REALIZE THERE WAS GOING TO BE A LITTLE MUSIC BEFORE SO I THINK I 'M GOING TO START WITH WHAT I JUST HEARD
StefonHarris_2011S HEARD
StefonHarris_2011S OKAY
StefonHarris_2011S OKAY
StefonHarris_2011S LET 'S WELCOME MR JAMIRE WILLIAMS ON THE DRUMS
StefonHarris_2011S OR THE PAST YOU REALLY ARE ALIVE RIGHT HERE IN THIS MOMENT THERE ARE SO MANY DECISIONS BEING MADE WHEN YOU WALK ON THE BANDSTAND WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT KEY WE WERE GOING TO PLAY
