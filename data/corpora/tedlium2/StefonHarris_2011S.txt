StefonHarris_2011S@16.38:27.01 I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE 'RE GOING TO PLAY I WON 'T BE ABLE TO TELL YOU WHAT IT IS UNTIL IT HAPPENS I DIDN 'T REALIZE THERE WAS GOING TO BE A LITTLE MUSIC BEFORE SO I THINK I 'M GOING TO START WITH WHAT I JUST HEARD
StefonHarris_2011S@121.37:127.14 HEARD
StefonHarris_2011S@148.84:155.02 OKAY
StefonHarris_2011S@351.8:355.35 OKAY
StefonHarris_2011S@373.11:375.35 LET 'S WELCOME MR JAMIRE WILLIAMS ON THE DRUMS
StefonHarris_2011S@399.98:409.97 OR THE PAST YOU REALLY ARE ALIVE RIGHT HERE IN THIS MOMENT THERE ARE SO MANY DECISIONS BEING MADE WHEN YOU WALK ON THE BANDSTAND WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT KEY WE WERE GOING TO PLAY
StefonHarris_2011S@409.97:424.82 IN IN THE MIDDLE WE SORT OF MADE OUR WAY INTO A SONG CALLED TITI BOOM BUT THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED MAYBE MAYBE NOT EVERYONE 'S LISTENING WE 'RE RESPONDING YOU HAVE NO TIME FOR PROJECTED IDEAS SO THE IDEA OF A MISTAKE
StefonHarris_2011S@443.82:454.18 IS AN OPPORTUNITY IN JAZZ SO IT 'S HARD TO EVEN DESCRIBE WHAT A FUNNY NOTE WOULD BE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I PLAYED A COLOR LIKE WE WERE PLAYING ON A PALETTE THAT SOUNDED LIKE
StefonHarris_2011S@606.66:618.19 SO YOU SEE HE PLAYED THIS NOTE I ENDED UP CREATING A MELODY OUT OF IT THE TEXTURE CHANGED IN THE DRUMS THIS TIME IT GOT A LITTLE BIT MORE RHYTHMIC A LITTLE BIT MORE INTENSE IN RESPONSE TO
StefonHarris_2011S@627.99:646.35 FELLOW BAND MEMBER TO INCORPORATE THE IDEA AND WE DON 'T ALLOW FOR CREATIVITY SO JAZZ THIS BANDSTAND IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING IT 'S A VERY PURIFYING EXPERIENCE AND I KNOW THAT I SPEAK FOR ALL OF US WHEN I TELL YOU THAT WE DON 'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED WE KNOW THAT TO BE ABLE TO COME ON THE BANDSTAND AND PLAY MUSIC IS A BLESSING SO
StefonHarris_2011S@646.35:655.63 HOW DOES THIS ALL RELATE TO BEHAVIORAL FINANCE WELL WE 'RE JAZZ MUSICIANS SO STEREOTYPICALLY WE DON 'T HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP TO FINANCE
StefonHarris_2011S@685.02:688.22 IT
StefonHarris_2011S@692.64:697.12 IT 'S KIND OF CHAOTIC BECAUSE I 'M BULLYING MY IDEAS I 'M TELLING THEM YOU COME WITH ME OVER THIS WAY
StefonHarris_2011S@697.12:714.55 IF I REALLY WANT THE MUSIC TO GO THERE THE BEST WAY FOR ME TO DO IT IS TO LISTEN THIS IS A SCIENCE OF LISTENING IT HAS FAR MORE TO DO WITH WHAT I CAN PERCEIVE THAN WHAT IT IS THAT I CAN DO SO IF I WANT THE MUSIC TO GET TO A CERTAIN LEVEL OF INTENSITY THE FIRST STEP FOR ME IS TO BE PATIENT TO LISTEN TO WHAT 'S GOING ON AND PULL
StefonHarris_2011S@714.55:717.36 FROM SOMETHING THAT 'S GOING ON AROUND ME WHEN YOU DO THAT
