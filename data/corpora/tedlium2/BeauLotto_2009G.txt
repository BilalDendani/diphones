BeauLotto_2009G@16.78:18.75 I WANT TO START WITH A GAME
BeauLotto_2009G@20.22:29.75 TO WIN THIS GAME ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SEE THE REALITY THAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU AS IT REALLY IS ALL RIGHT SO WE HAVE TWO PANELS HERE OF COLORED DOTS
BeauLotto_2009G@30.49:40.62 AND ONE OF THOSE DOTS IS THE SAME IN THE TWO PANELS OKAY AND YOU HAVE TO TELL ME WHICH ONE NOW NARROW IT DOWN TO
BeauLotto_2009G@49.72:56.25 GRAY ONE REALLY OKAY HOW MANY PEOPLE THINK IT'S THE GREEN ONE
BeauLotto_2009G@58.04:62.35 AND HOW MANY PEOPLE THINK IT'S THE ORANGE ONE
BeauLotto_2009G@65.79:69.39 LET 'S FIND OUT WHAT THE REALITY IS HERE IS THE ORANGE ONE
BeauLotto_2009G@73.42:79.73 HERE IS THE GREEN ONE AND HERE IS THE GRAY ONE
BeauLotto_2009G@89.46:97.60 SO THIS PRETTY AMAZING ACTUALLY ISN'T IT BECAUSE NEARLY EVERY LIVING SYSTEM HAS EVOLVED THE ABILITY TO DETECT LIGHT IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SO FOR US
BeauLotto_2009G@97.97:105.68 SEEING COLOR IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST THINGS THE BRAIN DOES AND YET EVEN AT THIS MOST FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL CONTEXT IS EVERYTHING
BeauLotto_2009G@106.72:115.42 WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS NOT THAT CONTEXT IS EVERYTHING BUT WHY IS CONTEXT EVERYTHING BECAUSE IT'S ANSWERING THAT QUESTION THAT TELLS US NOT ONLY
BeauLotto_2009G@116.04:122.18 WE SEE WHAT WE DO BUT WHO WE ARE AS INDIVIDUALS AND WHO WE ARE AS A SOCIETY
BeauLotto_2009G@135.99:143.32 NOW CAN ANY OF YOU SEE THE PREDATOR THAT'S ABOUT TO JUMP OUT AT YOU AND IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET YOU'RE DEAD RIGHT
BeauLotto_2009G@144.32:155.07 CAN ANYONE SEE IT ANYONE NO NOW LET 'S SEE THE SURFACES ACCORDING THE QUALITY OF LIGHT THAT THEY REFLECT AND NOW YOU SEE IT SO COLOR
BeauLotto_2009G@155.65:165.63 TO SEE THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SURFACES ACCORDING TO THE FULL SPECTRUM OF LIGHT THAT THEY REFLECT BUT WHAT YOU'VE JUST DONE IS IN MANY RESPECTS MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE
BeauLotto_2009G@166.29:179.12 WHY BECAUSE AS BERKELEY TELLS US WE HAVE NO DIRECT ACCESS TO OUR PHYSICAL WORLD OTHER THAN THROUGH OUR SENSES AND THE LIGHT THAT FALLS ON TO OUR EYES IS DETERMINED BY MULTIPLE THINGS IN THE WORLD NOT ONLY THE COLOR OF OBJECTS
BeauLotto_2009G@179.37:188.74 BUT ALSO THE COLOR OF THEIR ILLUMINATION AND THE COLOR OF THE SPACE BETWEEN US AND THOSE OBJECTS YOU VARY ANY ONE OF THOSE PARAMETERS AND YOU'LL CHANGE THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT THAT FALLS
BeauLotto_2009G@206.10:215.31 THEY ARE IDENTICAL IN EVERY SINGLE WAY IDENTICAL IN SHAPE SIZE SPECTRAL CONTENT THEY ARE THE SAME AS FAR AS YOUR EYE IS CONCERNED
BeauLotto_2009G@216.36:223.29 AND YET THEY COME FROM COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SOURCES THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
BeauLotto_2009G@223.80:231.01 COMES FROM A YELLOW SURFACE IN SHADOW ORIENTED FACING THE LEFT VIEWED THROUGH A PINKISH MEDIUM
BeauLotto_2009G@231.49:238.79 THE ONE ON THE LEFT COMES FROM AN ORANGE SURFACE UNDER DIRECT LIGHT FACING TO THE RIGHT VIEWED THROUGH A SORT OF A BLUEISH MEDIUM
BeauLotto_2009G@239.26:247.49 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MEANINGS GIVING RISE TO THE EXACT SAME RETINAL INFORMATION AND YET IT'S ONLY THE RETINAL INFORMATION THAT WE GET
BeauLotto_2009G@248.51:254.91 SO HOW ON EARTH DO WE EVEN SEE SO IF YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING IN THIS NEXT EIGHTEEN MINUTES
BeauLotto_2009G@255.15:262.92 REMEMBER THIS THAT THE LIGHT THAT FALLS ON TO YOUR EYE SENSORY INFORMATION IS MEANINGLESS BECAUSE IT COULD MEAN LITERALLY ANYTHING
BeauLotto_2009G@263.39:271.15 AND WHAT'S TRUE FOR SENSORY INFORMATION IS TRUE FOR INFORMATION GENERALLY THERE IS NO INHERENT MEANING IN INFORMATION IT'S WHAT WE DO WITH THAT INFORMATION THAT MATTERS
BeauLotto_2009G@272.14:285.47 SO HOW DO WE SEE WELL WE SEE BY LEARNING TO SEE SO THE BRAIN EVOLVED THE MECHANISMS FOR FINDING PATTERNS FINDING RELATIONSHIPS IN INFORMATION AND ASSOCIATING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH A BEHAVIORAL MEANING
BeauLotto_2009G@285.76:296.91 A SIGNIFICANCE BY INTERACTING WITH THE WORLD WE'RE VERY AWARE OF THIS IN THE FORM OF MORE COGNITIVE ATTRIBUTES LIKE LANGUAGE SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME LETTER STRINGS AND I WANT YOU TO READ THEM OUT FOR ME IF YOU CAN
BeauLotto_2009G@324.21:332.71 SO YOU DON'T DO IT AGAIN SO LET ME SHOW YOU HOW QUICKLY OUR BRAINS CAN REDEFINE NORMALITY EVEN AT THE SIMPLEST THING THE BRAIN DOES WHICH IS COLOR
BeauLotto_2009G@332.98:340.58 SO IF I COULD HAVE THE LIGHTS DOWN UP HERE I WANT YOU TO FIRST NOTICE THAT THOSE TWO DESERT SCENES ARE PHYSICALLY THE SAME ONE IS SIMPLY THE FLIPPING OF THE OTHER
BeauLotto_2009G@341.23:342.40 OKAY
BeauLotto_2009G@343.64:355.15 NOW I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THAT DOT BETWEEN THE GREEN AND THE RED OKAY AND I WANT YOU TO STARE AT THAT DOT DON'T LOOK ANYWHERE ELSE AND WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THAT FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS WHICH IS A BIT OF A KILLER IN AN EIGHTEEN MINUTE TALK
BeauLotto_2009G@357.89:363.12 REALLY WANT YOU TO LEARN AND I'LL TELL YOU DON'T LOOK ANYWHERE ELSE AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE YOUR HEAD
BeauLotto_2009G@375.35:380.18 I TELL YOU I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THE DOT BETWEEN THE TWO DESERT SCENES SO WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT NOW
BeauLotto_2009G@385.02:388.95 HAVE THE LIGHTS UP AGAIN I TAKE IT FROM YOUR RESPONSE THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME
BeauLotto_2009G@389.77:391.77 RIGHT WHY BECAUSE
BeauLotto_2009G@392.86:400.85 IS SEEING THAT SAME INFORMATION AS IF THE RIGHT ONE IS STILL UNDER RED LIGHT AND THE LEFT ONE IS STILL UNDER GREEN LIGHT THAT'S YOUR NEW NORMAL
BeauLotto_2009G@401.46:408.98 SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR CONTEXT IT MEANS THAT I CAN TAKE THESE TWO IDENTICAL SQUARES AND I CAN PUT THEM IN LIGHT AND DARK SURROUNDS AND NOW THE ONE ON THE DARK SURROUND LOOKS LIGHTER THAN THE ONE ON THE
BeauLotto_2009G@409.98:418.52 WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT IS NOT SIMPLY THE LIGHT AND DARK SURROUNDS THAT MATTER IT'S WHAT THOSE LIGHT AND DARK SURROUNDS MEANT FOR YOUR BEHAVIOR IN THE PAST SO I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN
BeauLotto_2009G@418.70:427.08 HERE WE HAVE THAT EXACT SAME ILLUSION WE HAVE TWO IDENTICAL TILES ON THE LEFT ONE IN A DARK SURROUND ONE IN A LIGHT SURROUND AND THE SAME THING OVER ON THE RIGHT
BeauLotto_2009G@436.95:447.40 NOTICE THAT ON THE LEFT THE TWO TILES LOOK NEARLY COMPLETELY OPPOSITE ONE VERY WHITE AND ONE VERY DARK ALRIGHT WHEREAS ON THE RIGHT THE TWO TILES LOOK NEARLY THE SAME
BeauLotto_2009G@447.86:460.37 AND YET THERE IS STILL ONE ON A DARK SURROUND AND ONE ON A LIGHT SURROUND WHY BECAUSE IF THE TILE IN THAT SHADOW WERE IN FACT IN SHADOW AND REFLECTING THE SAME AMOUNT OF LIGHT TO YOUR EYE AS THE ONE OUTSIDE THE SHADOW
BeauLotto_2009G@460.71:473.23 IT WOULD HAVE TO BE MORE REFLECTIVE JUST THE LAWS OF PHYSICS SO YOU SEE IT THAT WAY WHEREAS ON THE RIGHT THE INFORMATION IS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE TWO TILES BEING UNDER THE SAME LIGHT IF THEY ARE UNDER THE SAME LIGHT REFLECTING THE SAME AMOUNT OF
BeauLotto_2009G@474.33:477.91 THEN THEY MUST BE EQUALLY REFLECTIVE SO YOU SEE IT THAT WAY
BeauLotto_2009G@488.40:494.65 BRIGHT ORANGE TILE AT THE SIDE THAT IS YOUR PERCEPTUAL REALITY THE PHYSICAL REALITY IS THAT THOSE TWO TILES ARE THE SAME
BeauLotto_2009G@497.56:506.30 HERE YOU SEE FOUR GRAY TILES ON YOUR LEFT SEVEN GRAY TILES ON THE RIGHT I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE THOSE TILES AT ALL BUT I'M GOING TO REVEAL THE REST OF THE
BeauLotto_2009G@507.01:521.62 AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR PERCEPTION THE FOUR BLUE TILES ON THE LEFT ARE GRAY THE SEVEN YELLOW TILES ON THE RIGHT ARE ALSO GRAY THEY ARE THE SAME OKAY DON'T BELIEVE ME LET 'S WATCH IT AGAIN
BeauLotto_2009G@522.98:530.86 WHAT'S TRUE FOR COLOR IS ALSO TRUE FOR COMPLEX PERCEPTIONS OF MOTION SO HERE WE HAVE LET 'S TURN THIS AROUND
BeauLotto_2009G@531.65:537.17 A DIAMOND AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO HOLD IT HERE AND
BeauLotto_2009G@540.33:551.27 AND FOR ALL OF YOU YOU'LL SEE IT PROBABLY SPINNING THIS DIRECTION NOW I WANT YOU TO KEEP LOOKING AT IT MOVE YOUR EYES AROUND BLINK MAYBE CLOSE ONE EYE AND SUDDENLY IT WILL FLIP AND START SPINNING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
BeauLotto_2009G@552.49:561.90 YES RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU GOT THAT YES KEEP BLINKING EVERY TIME YOU BLINK IT WILL SWITCH ALRIGHT SO I CAN ASK YOU WHICH DIRECTION IS IT ROTATING
BeauLotto_2009G@563.59:564.76 HOW DO YOU KNOW
BeauLotto_2009G@565.62:572.35 YOUR BRAIN DOESN'T KNOW BECAUSE BOTH ARE EQUALLY LIKELY SO DEPENDING ON WHERE IT LOOKS IT FLIPS BETWEEN THE TWO POSSIBILITIES
BeauLotto_2009G@585.26:599.01 SEES ILLUSIONS DOES THE MOST COMPLICATED THINGS THAT EVEN OUR MOST SOPHISTICATED COMPUTERS CAN'T DO SO IN MY LAB WE OF COURSE WORK ON BUMBLEBEES BECAUSE WE CAN COMPLETELY CONTROL THEIR EXPERIENCE AND SEE HOW THAT ALTERS THE ARCHITECTURE OF THEIR BRAIN AND WE DO THIS IN WHAT WE CALL THE BEE MATRIX
BeauLotto_2009G@599.52:606.24 AND HERE YOU HAVE THE HIVE YOU CAN SEE THE QUEEN BEE THAT LARGE BEE IN THE MIDDLE THERE THOSE ARE ALL HER DAUGHTERS THE EGGS AND THEY GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THIS
BeauLotto_2009G@607.46:613.58 AND THE ARENA VIA THIS TUBE AND YOU'LL SEE ONE OF THE BEES COME
BeauLotto_2009G@622.59:627.57 RIGHT WE PULL THEM OUT PUT THEM IN THE FRIDGE AND THEY FALL ASLEEP AND THEN YOU CAN SUPERGLUE LITTLE NUMBERS ON THEM
BeauLotto_2009G@647.54:661.75 AND SOMETIMES THEY LEARN NOT TO GO TO THE BLUE BUT TO GO TO WHERE THE OTHER BEES GO SO THEY COPY EACH OTHER THEY CAN COUNT TO FIVE THEY CAN RECOGNIZE FACES AND HERE SHE COMES DOWN THE LADDER AND SHE'LL COME INTO THE HIVE FIND AN EMPTY HONEY POT AND THROW UP AND THAT'S HONEY
BeauLotto_2009G@662.85:664.29 NOW REMEMBER
BeauLotto_2009G@675.67:688.10 AND THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS NO THOSE ARE ACTUALLY BLUE FLOWERS BUT THOSE ARE BLUE FLOWERS UNDER GREEN LIGHT SO THEY ARE USING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE COLORS TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE DO
BeauLotto_2009G@688.77:702.58 SO ILLUSIONS ARE OFTEN USED ESPECIALLY IN ART IN THE WORDS OF A MORE CONTEMPORARY ARTIST TO DEMONSTRATE THE FRAGILITY OF OUR SENSES OKAY THIS IS COMPLETE RUBBISH THE SENSES AREN'T FRAGILE AND IF THEY WERE WE WOULDN'T BE HERE
BeauLotto_2009G@711.18:719.35 INSTEAD THE BRAIN EVOLVED TO SEE THE WORLD THE WAY IT WAS USEFUL TO SEE IN THE PAST AND HOW WE SEE IS BY CONTINUALLY REDEFINING
BeauLotto_2009G@723.18:723.40 SO
BeauLotto_2009G@724.68:731.67 HOW CAN WE TAKE THIS INCREDIBLE CAPACITY OF PLASTICITY OF THE BRAIN AND GET PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE THEIR WORLD
BeauLotto_2009G@732.36:740.91 ONE OF THE WAYS WE DO IN MY LAB AND STUDIO IS WE TRANSLATE THE LIGHT INTO SOUND AND WE ENABLE PEOPLE TO HEAR THEIR VISUAL WORLD
BeauLotto_2009G@742.44:744.06 AND THEY CAN NAVIGATE THE WORLD USING
BeauLotto_2009G@745.77:753.70 HERE IS DAVID IN THE RIGHT AND HE IS HOLDING A CAMERA ON THE LEFT IS WHAT HIS CAMERA SEES AND YOU'LL SEE THERE IS A LINE A FAINT LINE GOING ACROSS THAT IMAGE
BeauLotto_2009G@753.94:760.59 THAT LINE IS BROKEN UP INTO THIRTY TWO SQUARES IN EACH SQUARE WE CALCULATE THE AVERAGE COLOR AND THEN WE JUST SIMPLY TRANSLATE THAT INTO SOUND
BeauLotto_2009G@760.99:764.15 AND NOW HE 'S GOING TO TURN AROUND
BeauLotto_2009G@767.20:768.62 AND FIND A PLATE ON THE
BeauLotto_2009G@788.41:795.54 HE FINDS IT AMAZING RIGHT SO NOT ONLY CAN WE CREATE A PROSTHETIC FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED BUT WE CAN ALSO INVESTIGATE
BeauLotto_2009G@804.13:815.10 SO WORKING WITH KIDS THEY CREATED IMAGES THINKING ABOUT WHAT MIGHT THE IMAGES YOU SEE SOUND LIKE IF WE COULD LISTEN TO THEM AND THEN WE TRANSLATED THESE IMAGES AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE IMAGES
BeauLotto_2009G@815.37:817.53 AND THIS IS A SIX YEAR OLD CHILD COMPOSING
BeauLotto_2009G@852.39:863.49 NOW WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN WHAT THIS SUGGESTS IS THAT NO ONE IS AN OUTSIDE OBSERVER OF NATURE OKAY WE ARE NOT DEFINED BY OUR CENTRAL PROPERTIES BY THE BITS THAT MAKE US UP
BeauLotto_2009G@864.80:874.33 DEFINED BY OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR INTERACTION WITH THAT ENVIRONMENT BY OUR ECOLOGY AND THAT ECOLOGY IS NECESSARILY RELATIVE HISTORICAL AND
BeauLotto_2009G@876.64:885.91 SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO FINISH WITH IS THIS OVER HERE BECAUSE WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IS REALLY CELEBRATE UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE I THINK ONLY THROUGH UNCERTAINTY
BeauLotto_2009G@886.18:895.82 IS THERE POTENTIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING SO IF SOME OF YOU ARE STILL FEELING A BIT TOO CERTAIN I'D LIKE TO DO THIS ONE SO IF WE HAVE THE LIGHTS DOWN
BeauLotto_2009G@897.15:897.62 WHAT WE HAVE
BeauLotto_2009G@899.67:906.13 HERE CAN EVERYONE SEE TWENTY FIVE PURPLE SURFACES ON YOUR LEFT
BeauLotto_2009G@920.66:926.20 RIGHT NOW YOU CAN SEE THAT CHANGES THE LIGHT THAT'S COMING THROUGH THERE RIGHT BECAUSE NOW THE LIGHT IS GOING
BeauLotto_2009G@927.53:937.35 YELLOWISH FILTER AND THEN A PURPLISH FILTER I'M GOING TO DO THIS OPPOSITE ON THE LEFT HERE I'M GOING TO PUT THE MIDDLE NINE UNDER
BeauLotto_2009G@938.26:948.45 PURPLISH LIGHT NOW SOME OF YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT THE LIGHT COMING THROUGH THOSE MIDDLE NINE ON THE RIGHT
BeauLotto_2009G@949.11:961.35 OR YOUR LEFT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE LIGHT COMING THROUGH THE MIDDLE NINE ON YOUR RIGHT AGREED YES OKAY SO THEY ARE PHYSICALLY THE SAME LET 'S PULL THE COVERS OFF
BeauLotto_2009G@965.84:966.64 REMEMBER
BeauLotto_2009G@969.16:981.59 YOU KNOW THE MIDDLE NINE ARE EXACTLY THE SAME DO THEY LOOK THE SAME NO THE QUESTION IS IS THAT AN ILLUSION AND I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THAT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
