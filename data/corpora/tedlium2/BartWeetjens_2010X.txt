BartWeetjens_2010X I'M HERE TODAY TO SHARE WITH YOU AN EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY EXTRAORDINARILY REWARDING JOURNEY ACTUALLY WHICH BROUGHT ME INTO
BartWeetjens_2010X TRAINING RATS TO SAVE HUMAN LIVES BY DETECTING LANDMINES AND TUBERCULOSIS
BartWeetjens_2010X AS A CHILD I HAD TWO PASSIONS ONE WAS A PASSION FOR RODENTS
BartWeetjens_2010X ALL KINDS OF RATS MICE HAMSTERS GERBILS SQUIRRELS YOU NAME IT I BRED IT AND I SOLD THEM TO
BartWeetjens_2010X I ALSO HAD A PASSION FOR AFRICA GROWING UP IN A MULTICULTURAL ENVIRONMENT WE HAD AFRICAN STUDENTS IN THE HOUSE AND I LEARNED ABOUT THEIR STORIES
BartWeetjens_2010X DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS DEPENDENCY ON IMPORTED KNOW HOW GOODS SERVICES EXUBERANT CULTURAL DIVERSITY
BartWeetjens_2010X I STARTED WORKING IN THE INDUSTRY BUT I WASN'T REALLY HAPPY TO CONTRIBUTE TO A MATERIAL CONSUMER SOCIETY
BartWeetjens_2010X IN A LINEAR EXTRACTING AND MANUFACTURING MODE I QUIT MY JOB TO FOCUS ON THE REAL WORLD PROBLEM
BartWeetjens_2010X TALKING NINETY FIVE NOW PRINCESS DIANA IS ANNOUNCING ON TV THAT LANDMINES FORM A STRUCTURAL BARRIER
BartWeetjens_2010X TO ANY DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS REALLY TRUE AS LONG AS THESE DEVICES ARE THERE OR THERE IS SUSPICION OF LANDMINES YOU CAN'T REALLY ENTER INTO THE LAND ACTUALLY THERE WAS AN APPEAL WORLDWIDE
BartWeetjens_2010X FOR NEW DETECTORS SUSTAINABLE
BartWeetjens_2010X BECAUSE AREN'T THEY VERMIN WELL ACTUALLY RATS ARE CONTRARY TO WHAT MOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THEM RATS ARE
BartWeetjens_2010X LEFT AND RIGHT THERE THE ANIMAL FINDS A MINE IT SCRATCHES ON THE SOIL AND THE ANIMAL COMES BACK FOR A FOOD REWARD VERY VERY SIMPLE
BartWeetjens_2010X VERY SUSTAINABLE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT HERE THE ANIMAL GETS ITS FOOD REWARD AND THAT'S HOW IT WORKS VERY VERY SIMPLE
BartWeetjens_2010X NOW WHY WOULD YOU USE RATS RATS HAVE BEEN USED SINCE THE FIFTIES LAST CENTURY IN ALL KINDS OF EXPERIMENTS RATS HAVE MORE GENETIC MATERIAL ALLOCATED TO OLFACTION THAN ANY OTHER MAMMAL SPECIES
BartWeetjens_2010X THEY'RE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO SMELL MOREOVER THEY HAVE THE MECHANISMS TO MAP ALL THESE SMELLS AND TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT
BartWeetjens_2010X HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE WITH RATS WELL DON'T TALK RAT BUT WE HAVE A CLICKER A STANDARD METHOD FOR ANIMAL TRAINING WHICH YOU SEE THERE
BartWeetjens_2010X A CLICKER WHICH MAKES A PARTICULAR SOUND WITH WHICH YOU CAN REINFORCE PARTICULAR BEHAVIORS FIRST OF ALL WE ASSOCIATE THE CLICK SOUND WITH A FOOD REWARD WHICH IS SMASHED BANANA AND PEANUTS TOGETHER IN A SYRINGE
BartWeetjens_2010X ONCE THE ANIMAL KNOWS CLICK FOOD CLICK FOOD CLICK FOOD SO CLICK IS FOOD WE BRING IT IN A CAGE WITH
BartWeetjens_2010X AND ACTUALLY THE ANIMAL LEARNS TO STICK THE NOSE IN THE HOLE UNDER WHICH A TARGET SCENT IS PLACED AND TO DO THAT FOR FIVE SECONDS FIVE SECONDS WHICH IS LONG FOR A RAT ONCE THE ANIMAL KNOWS THIS WE MAKE THE TASK A BIT MORE DIFFICULT
BartWeetjens_2010X IT LEARNS HOW TO FIND THE TARGET SMELL IN A CAGE WITH SEVERAL HOLES UP TO TEN HOLES THEN THE ANIMAL LEARNS TO WALK ON A LEASH IN THE OPEN AND FIND TARGETS IN THE NEXT STEP
BartWeetjens_2010X THERE'S A NUMBER OF MINES PLACED BLINDLY AND THE TEAM OF TRAINER AND THEIR RAT HAVE TO FIND ALL THE
BartWeetjens_2010X JUST LIKE DOGS BY THE WAY MAYBE ONE SLIGHT DIFFERENCE WE CAN TRAIN RATS AT A FIFTH OF THE PRICE OF TRAINING THE MINING DOG
BartWeetjens_2010X THIS IS OUR TEAM IN MOZAMBIQUE ONE TANZANIAN TRAINER WHO TRANSFERS THE SKILLS TO THESE THREE MOZAMBICAN FELLOWS AND YOU SHOULD SEE THE PRIDE IN THE EYES OF THESE PEOPLE THEY HAVE A SKILL
BartWeetjens_2010X WHICH MAKES THEM MUCH LESS DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN AID MOREOVER THIS SMALL TEAM TOGETHER WITH OF COURSE YOU NEED THE HEAVY VEHICLES AND THE MANUAL DEMINERS TO FOLLOW UP
BartWeetjens_2010X WITH THIS SMALL INVESTMENT IN A RAT CAPACITY WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED IN MOZAMBIQUE THAT WE CAN REDUCE THE COST PRICE PER SQ METER
BartWeetjens_2010X UP TO SIXTY PERCENT OF WHAT IS CURRENTLY NORMAL TWO DOLLARS PER SQ METER WE DO IT AT ONE POINT ONE EIGHT AND WE CAN STILL BRING THAT PRICE DOWN QUESTION OF SCALE
BartWeetjens_2010X IF YOU CAN BRING IN MORE RATS WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THE OUTPUT EVEN BIGGER WE HAVE A DEMONSTRATION SITE IN MOZAMBIQUE
BartWeetjens_2010X ELEVEN AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS HAVE SEEN THAT THEY CAN BECOME LESS DEPENDENT BY USING THIS TECHNOLOGY THEY HAVE SIGNED THE PACT FOR PEACE AND TREATY IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION AND
BartWeetjens_2010X THEY ENDORSE HERO RATS TO CLEAR THEIR COMMON BORDERS OF LANDMINES BUT LET ME BRING YOU TO A VERY DIFFERENT PROBLEM AND THERE'S ABOUT SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE LAST YEAR THAT WALKED ON A LANDMINE BUT
BartWeetjens_2010X LAST YEAR ALMOST ONE POINT NINE MILLION DIED FROM TUBERCULOSIS AS A FIRST CAUSE OF INFECTION ESPECIALLY IN AFRICA WHERE T B AND HIV ARE STRONGLY LINKED THERE IS A HUGE
BartWeetjens_2010X COMMON PROBLEM MICROSCOPY THE STANDARD WHO PROCEDURE REACHED FROM FORTY TO SIXTY PERCENT RELIABILITY
BartWeetjens_2010X IN TANZANIA THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE T B PATIENTS
BartWeetjens_2010X B SECONDARY INFECTIONS AND
BartWeetjens_2010X IF HOWEVER YOU ARE DETECTED VERY EARLY DIAGNOSED EARLY TREATMENT CAN START AND EVEN IN HIV POSITIVES
BartWeetjens_2010X IT MAKES SENSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY CURE T B EVEN IN HIV POSITIVES
BartWeetjens_2010X SO IN OUR COMMON LANGUAGE DUTCH THE NAME FOR
BartWeetjens_2010X WHICH ETYMOLOGICALLY REFERS TO THE SMELL OF TAR ALREADY THE OLD CHINESE AND
BartWeetjens_2010X ACTUALLY PUBLISHED DOCUMENTED THAT T B CAN BE DIAGNOSED BASED ON THE VOLATILES EXUDING FROM
BartWeetjens_2010X PATIENTS SO WHAT WE DID IS WE COLLECTED SOME SAMPLES JUST AS A WAY OF TESTING FROM HOSPITALS TRAINED RATS ON THEM AND
BartWeetjens_2010X THIS WORKS AND WONDER WELL WE CAN REACH EIGHTY NINE PERCENT SENSITIVITY EIGHTY SIX PERCENT SPECIFICITY USING
BartWeetjens_2010X HOW IT WORKS AND REALLY THIS IS A GENERIC TECHNOLOGY
BartWeetjens_2010X HOW DOES IT WORK YOU HAVE A CASSETTE WITH
BartWeetjens_2010X OF A SECOND TO DISCRIMINATE THE SCENT SO IT GOES EXTREMELY FAST HERE IT'S ALREADY AT THE THIRD SAMPLE
BartWeetjens_2010X WHICH PATIENTS ARE POSITIVE WHICH ARE
BartWeetjens_2010X LIKE THIS PROVIDED THAT YOU HAVE RATS AND WE HAVE NOW CURRENTLY TWENTY FIVE TUBERCULOSIS RATS
BartWeetjens_2010X A CAGE LIKE THIS OPERATING THROUGHOUT THE DAY CAN PROCESS ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SAMPLES
BartWeetjens_2010X FIVE CLINICS IN DAR ES SALAAM ON A POPULATION OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WHERE FIFTEEN THOUSAND REPORTED TO GET
BartWeetjens_2010X WE WERE ABLE TO INCREASE CASE DETECTION RATES BY OVER THIRTY PERCENT THROUGHOUT LAST YEAR WE'VE BEEN
BartWeetjens_2010X DEPENDING ON WHICH INTERVALS YOU TAKE WE'VE BEEN CONSISTENTLY INCREASING CASE DETECTION RATES IN FIVE HOSPITALS IN DAR ES SALAAM BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY PERCENT
BartWeetjens_2010X SO THIS IS REALLY CONSIDERABLE KNOWING THAT A MISSED PATIENT BY MICROSCOPY INFECTS UP TO FIFTEEN PEOPLE HEALTHY PEOPLE PER YEAR
BartWeetjens_2010X YOU CAN BE SURE THAT WE HAVE SAVED LOTS OF LIVES AT LEAST OUR HERO RATS HAVE SAVED LOTS OF LIVES THE WAY FORWARD FOR US IS NOW TO STANDARDIZE THIS TECHNOLOGY
BartWeetjens_2010X AND THERE ARE SIMPLE THINGS LIKE FOR INSTANCE WE HAVE A SMALL LASER IN THE SNIFFER HOLE WHERE THE ANIMAL HAS TO STICK FOR FIVE SECONDS SO TO STANDARDIZE THIS ALSO TO STANDARDIZE THE
BartWeetjens_2010X AND TO SEMI AUTOMATE THIS IN ORDER TO REPLICATE THIS ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE AND AFFECT THE LIVES OF MANY MORE PEOPLE
BartWeetjens_2010X TO CONCLUDE THERE ARE ALSO OTHER APPLICATIONS AT THE HORIZON HERE IS A FIRST PROTOTYPE OF OUR CAMERA RAT WHICH IS A RAT WITH A RAT BACKPACK
BartWeetjens_2010X WITH A CAMERA THAT CAN GO UNDER RUBBLE TO DETECT FOR VICTIMS AFTER EARTHQUAKE AND SO ON THIS IS IN A PROTOTYPE STAGE WE DON'T HAVE A WORKING SYSTEM HERE YET
BartWeetjens_2010X TO CONCLUDE I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO SAY YOU MAY THINK THIS IS ABOUT RATS THESE PROJECTS BUT IN THE END IT IS ABOUT PEOPLE IT IS ABOUT EMPOWERING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES
BartWeetjens_2010X TO TACKLE DIFFICULT EXPENSIVE AND DANGEROUS HUMANITARIAN DETECTION TASKS AND
BartWeetjens_2010X DOING THAT WITH A LOCAL RESOURCE PLENTY AVAILABLE SO SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IS TO KEEP ON CHALLENGING YOUR PERCEPTION ABOUT
BartWeetjens_2010X THE RESOURCES SURROUNDING YOU WHETHER THEY ARE ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGICAL ANIMAL OR HUMAN AND TO RESPECTFULLY HARMONIZE WITH THEM IN ORDER
BartWeetjens_2010X TO FOSTER A SUSTAINABLE WORK THANK YOU VERY MUCH
