DanDennett_2006 IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE BACK I LOVE THIS WONDERFUL GATHERING AND YOU MUST BE WONDERING WHAT ON EARTH HAVE THEY PUT UP THE WRONG SLIDE NO NO
DanDennett_2006 LOOK AT THIS MAGNIFICENT BEAST AND ASK THE QUESTION
DanDennett_2006 WHO DESIGNED IT THIS IS
DanDennett_2006 TED THIS IS TECHNOLOGY ENTERTAINMENT DESIGN AND THERE'S A DAIRY COW
DanDennett_2006 QUITE WONDERFULLY DESIGNED ANIMAL AND I WAS THINKING HOW DO I INTRODUCE THIS AND I THOUGHT WELL MAYBE THAT OLD DOGGEREL BY JOYCE KILMER YOU KNOW
DanDennett_2006 ARE MADE BY FOOLS LIKE ME BUT ONLY GOD CAN MAKE A TREE AND YOU MIGHT SAY WELL GOD DESIGNED THE COW BUT OF COURSE GOD GOT A LOT OF HELP
DanDennett_2006 THIS IS THE ANCESTOR OF CATTLE THIS IS THE ORYX AND IT WAS DESIGNED BY NATURAL SELECTION THE PROCESS OF NATURAL SELECTION OVER MANY MILLIONS OF YEARS
DanDennett_2006 AND THEN IT BECAME DOMESTICATED THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO AND HUMAN BEINGS BECAME ITS STEWARDS
DanDennett_2006 AND WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY GRADUALLY REDESIGNED IT AND REDESIGNED IT AND REDESIGNED IT AND THEN MORE RECENTLY THEY
DanDennett_2006 REALLY BEGAN TO DO SORT OF REVERSE ENGINEERING ON THIS BEAST AND FIGURE OUT JUST WHAT THE PARTS WERE HOW THEY WORKED AND HOW THEY MIGHT BE OPTIMIZED HOW THEY MIGHT BE MADE BETTER
DanDennett_2006 NOW WHY AM I TALKING ABOUT
DanDennett_2006 BECAUSE I WANT TO SAY THAT MUCH THE SAME THING IS TRUE OF RELIGIONS RELIGIONS ARE NATURAL PHENOMENA THEY'RE JUST AS NATURAL AS
DanDennett_2006 THEY HAVE EVOLVED OVER MILLENNIA THEY HAVE A BIOLOGICAL BASE JUST LIKE THE
DanDennett_2006 THEY HAVE BECOME DOMESTICATED AND HUMAN BEINGS HAVE BEEN REDESIGNING THEIR RELIGIONS FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS
DanDennett_2006 THIS IS TED AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT DESIGN BECAUSE WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS REALLY SINCE THE FIRST TIME YOU SAW ME SOME OF YOU SAW ME AT TED WHEN I WAS TALKING ABOUT RELIGION
DanDennett_2006 AND IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS I'VE BEEN WORKING JUST ABOUT NON STOP ON THIS TOPIC AND YOU MIGHT SAY IT'S ABOUT THE REVERSE ENGINEERING OF RELIGIONS
DanDennett_2006 NOW THAT VERY IDEA I THINK STRIKES TERROR IN MANY PEOPLE OR ANGER OR ANXIETY OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER
DanDennett_2006 AND THAT IS THE SPELL THAT I WANT TO BREAK I WANT TO SAY NO RELIGIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT NATURAL PHENOMENON WE SHOULD STUDY THEM
DanDennett_2006 WITH THE SAME INTENSITY THAT WE STUDY ALL THE OTHER IMPORTANT NATURAL PHENOMENA LIKE GLOBAL WARMING AS WE HEARD SO ELOQUENTLY LAST NIGHT FROM AL GORE
DanDennett_2006 TODAY 'S RELIGIONS ARE BRILLIANTLY DESIGNED BRILLIANTLY DESIGNED THEY'RE IMMENSELY POWERFUL SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS
DanDennett_2006 AND MANY OF THEIR FEATURES CAN BE TRACED BACK TO EARLIER FEATURES THAT WE CAN REALLY MAKE SENSE OF BY REVERSE ENGINEERING
DanDennett_2006 AND AS WITH THE COW THERE'S A MIXTURE OF EVOLUTIONARY DESIGN DESIGNED BY NATURAL SELECTION ITSELF AND INTELLIGENT DESIGN
DanDennett_2006 MORE OR LESS INTELLIGENT DESIGN REDESIGNED BY HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE TRYING TO REDESIGN THEIR RELIGIONS
DanDennett_2006 AT THIS TIME WHEN I CLAIM NOT TO KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT RELIGION TO KNOW WHAT OTHER POLICY PROPOSALS TO MAKE AND IT'S ONE THAT ECHOES
DanDennett_2006 IN PRIMARY SCHOOL IN HIGH SCHOOL IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND IN HOME SCHOOLING
DanDennett_2006 SO WHAT I'M PROPOSING IS JUST AS WE REQUIRE READING WRITING ARITHMETIC AMERICAN HISTORY
DanDennett_2006 SO WE SHOULD HAVE A CURRICULUM ON FACTS ABOUT ALL THE RELIGIONS OF THE WORLD ABOUT THEIR HISTORY
DanDennett_2006 ABOUT THEIR CREEDS ABOUT THEIR TEXTS THEIR MUSIC THEIR SYMBOLISMS THEIR PROHIBITIONS THEIR REQUIREMENTS
DanDennett_2006 AND THIS SHOULD BE PRESENTED FACTUALLY STRAIGHTFORWARDLY WITH NO PARTICULAR SPIN TO ALL OF THE CHILDREN IN THE COUNTRY
DanDennett_2006 AND AS LONG AS YOU TEACH THEM THAT YOU CAN TEACH THEM ANYTHING ELSE YOU LIKE
DanDennett_2006 THAT I THINK IS MAXIMAL TOLERANCE FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AS LONG AS YOU
DanDennett_2006 BUT ALSO LET THEM KNOW ABOUT OTHER RELIGIONS NOW WHY DO I SAY THAT BECAUSE DEMOCRACY DEPENDS
DanDennett_2006 ON AN INFORMED CITIZENSHIP INFORMED CONSENT IS THE VERY BEDROCK OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF DEMOCRACY
DanDennett_2006 AS RESPONSIBLE ADULTS NOW CHILDREN
DanDennett_2006 BELOW THE AGE OF CONSENT ARE A SPECIAL CASE
DanDennett_2006 A WORD THAT PASTOR RICK JUST USED PARENTS ARE STEWARDS OF THEIR CHILDREN
DanDennett_2006 THEM YOU CAN'T OWN YOUR CHILDREN YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE WORLD
DanDennett_2006 TO THE STATE TO THEM TO TAKE CARE OF THEM RIGHT
DanDennett_2006 YOU MAY TEACH THEM WHATEVER CREED YOU THINK IS MOST IMPORTANT BUT I SAY YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
DanDennett_2006 TO LET THEM BE INFORMED ABOUT ALL THE OTHER CREEDS IN THE WORLD TOO THE REASON I'VE TAKEN THIS TIME IS I'VE BEEN FASCINATED TO HEAR SOME OF THE REACTIONS TO THIS
DanDennett_2006 ONE REVIEWER FOR A ROMAN CATHOLIC NEWSPAPER CALLED IT TOTALITARIAN IT STRIKES ME AS PRACTICALLY LIBERTARIAN
DanDennett_2006 IS IT TOTALITARIAN TO REQUIRE READING WRITING AND ARITHMETIC I DON'T THINK SO ALL I'M SAYING IS
DanDennett_2006 FACTS FACTS ONLY NO VALUES JUST FACTS ABOUT ALL THE WORLD 'S RELIGIONS
DanDennett_2006 ANOTHER REVIEWER CALLED IT HILARIOUS WELL
DanDennett_2006 I'M REALLY BOTHERED BY THE FACT THAT ANYBODY WOULD THINK THAT WAS HILARIOUS IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE SUCH A PLAUSIBLE
DanDennett_2006 NATURAL EXTENSION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES WE ALREADY HAVE THAT I'M SHOCKED TO THINK ANYBODY WOULD FIND THAT JUST RIDICULOUS I KNOW MANY RELIGIONS
DanDennett_2006 THE PURITY OF THEIR FAITH AMONG THEIR CHILDREN THAT THEY ARE INTENT ON KEEPING THEIR CHILDREN IGNORANT OF OTHER FAITHS
DanDennett_2006 I DON'T THINK THAT'S DEFENSIBLE
DanDennett_2006 BUT I'D REALLY BE PLEASED TO GET YOUR ANSWERS ON THAT ANY REACTIONS TO THAT LATER BUT NOW I'M GOING TO MOVE ON BACK TO THE COW
DanDennett_2006 THIS PICTURE WHICH I PULLED OFF THE WEB THE FELLOW ON THE LEFT IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS PICTURE THAT'S THE STEWARD COWS COULDN'T LIVE
DanDennett_2006 WITHOUT HUMAN STEWARDS THEY'RE DOMESTICATED THEY'RE A SORT OF ECTOSYMBIONT THEY DEPEND ON US FOR THEIR SURVIVAL AND
DanDennett_2006 PASTOR RICK WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT SHEEP I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SHEEP TOO THERE'S A LOT OF SERENDIPITOUS CONVERGENCE HERE HOW CLEVER IT WAS OF SHEEP TO ACQUIRE SHEPHERDS
DanDennett_2006 THINK OF WHAT THIS GOT THEM THEY COULD OUTSOURCE ALL THEIR PROBLEMS
DanDennett_2006 HEALTH MAINTENANCE
DanDennett_2006 THE ONLY COST IN MOST FLOCKS IS A LOSS OF FREE MATING
DanDennett_2006 WHAT A DEAL
DanDennett_2006 HOW CLEVER OF SHEEP YOU MIGHT SAY EXCEPT OF COURSE IT WASN'T THE SHEEP 'S CLEVERNESS WE ALL KNOW SHEEP ARE NOT EXACTLY ROCKET SCIENTISTS THEY'RE NOT VERY SMART
DanDennett_2006 IT WASN'T THE CLEVERNESS OF THE SHEEP AT ALL THEY WERE CLUELESS BUT IT WAS A VERY CLEVER MOVE
DanDennett_2006 WHOSE CLEVER MOVE WAS IT IT WAS A CLEVER MOVE OF NATURAL SELECTION ITSELF FRANCIS CRICK
DanDennett_2006 CO DISCOVERER OF THE STRUCTURE OF DNA WITH JIM WATSON ONCE JOKED ABOUT WHAT HE CALLED ORGEL 'S SECOND RULE
DanDennett_2006 LESLIE ORGEL IS STILL A MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST BRILLIANT GUY AND ORGEL 'S SECOND RULE IS EVOLUTION IS CLEVERER THAN YOU ARE
DanDennett_2006 NOW THAT IS NOT INTELLIGENT DESIGN NOT FROM FRANCIS CRICK
DanDennett_2006 MOVEMENT IS BASICALLY A HOAX THE DESIGNS DISCOVERED BY THE PROCESS OF NATURAL SELECTION
DanDennett_2006 YEARS AGO I TOLD THE STORY ABOUT AN ANT CLIMBING A BLADE OF GRASS AND WHY WAS THE ANT DOING IT WELL IT'S BECAUSE ITS BRAIN HAD BEEN INFECTED WITH
DanDennett_2006 A LANCET FLUKE THAT WAS NEEDED TO GET INTO THE BELLY OF A SHEEP OR A COW IN ORDER TO REPRODUCE IT WAS SORT OF A SPOOKY STORY AND I THINK SOME PEOPLE MAY HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD LANCET FLUKES AREN'T SMART
DanDennett_2006 I SUBMIT THAT THE INTELLIGENCE OF A LANCET FLUKE IS DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN PETUNIA AND CARROT THEY'RE NOT REALLY BRIGHT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE THE LESSON WE LEARN FROM THIS IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A MIND
DanDennett_2006 TO BE A BENEFICIARY THE DESIGN IS THERE IN NATURE BUT IT'S NOT IN ANYBODY 'S HEAD IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT'S THE WAY EVOLUTION WORKS
DanDennett_2006 TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO AT THE DAWN OF AGRICULTURE HUMAN POPULATION PLUS LIVESTOCK AND PETS WAS APPROXIMATELY A TENTH OF ONE PER CENT OF THE TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRAE LANDMASS THAT WAS JUST TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO
DanDennett_2006 I TALKED TO PAUL AFTERWARDS I WANTED TO CHECK TO FIND OUT HOW HE'D CALCULATED THIS AND GET THE SOURCES AND SO FORTH AND HE GAVE ME A PAPER THAT HE HAD WRITTEN ON THIS THERE WAS A PASSAGE IN IT WHICH HE DID NOT PRESENT HERE AND I THINK IT IS SO GOOD I'M GOING TO READ IT TO
DanDennett_2006 OVER BILLIONS OF YEARS ON A UNIQUE SPHERE CHANCE HAS PAINTED A THIN COVERING OF LIFE COMPLEX IMPROBABLE WONDERFUL AND FRAGILE
DanDennett_2006 SUDDENLY WE HUMANS A RECENTLY ARRIVED SPECIES NO LONGER SUBJECT TO THE CHECKS AND BALANCES INHERENT IN NATURE HAVE GROWN IN POPULATION TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLIGENCE TO A POSITION OF TERRIBLE POWER WE NOW WIELD THE PAINTBRUSH
DanDennett_2006 WE HEARD ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE AS A THIN LAYER OF VARNISH LIFE ITSELF IS JUST A THIN COAT OF PAINT ON THIS PLANET
DanDennett_2006 AND WE'RE THE ONES THAT HOLD THE PAINTBRUSH AND HOW CAN WE DO THAT THE KEY TO OUR DOMINATION OF THE PLANET IS CULTURE AND THE KEY TO CULTURE IS RELIGION
DanDennett_2006 THIS IS A MILLION PEOPLE GATHERING ON THE BANKS OF THE GANGES IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE PERHAPS THE LARGEST SINGLE GATHERING OF HUMAN BEINGS EVER
DanDennett_2006 AS SEEN FROM SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPH HERE 'S A BIG CROWD HERE 'S ANOTHER CROWD IN MECCA MARTIANS WOULD BE AMAZED BY THIS THEY'D WANT TO KNOW HOW IT ORIGINATED WHAT IT WAS FOR AND HOW IT PERPETUATES ITSELF
DanDennett_2006 I'M GOING TO PASS OVER THIS THE ANT ISN'T ALONE THERE'S ALL SORTS OF WONDERFUL CASES OF SPECIES
DanDennett_2006 TRUE STORY
DanDennett_2006 IN OTHER WORDS WE HAVE THESE HIJACKERS YOU'VE SEEN THIS SLIDE BEFORE FROM FOUR YEARS AGO A PARASITE THAT INFECTS THE BRAIN AND INDUCES EVEN SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR ON BEHALF OF A CAUSE OTHER THAN ONE 'S OWN GENETIC FITNESS
DanDennett_2006 DOES THAT EVER HAPPEN TO US YES IT DOES QUITE WONDERFULLY
DanDennett_2006 THE ARABIC WORD ISLAM MEANS SUBMISSION IT MEANS SURRENDER OF SELF INTEREST TO THE WILL OF ALLAH BUT I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT ISLAM I'M TALKING ALSO ABOUT CHRISTIANITY
DanDennett_2006 THIS IS A PARCHMENT MUSIC PAGE THAT I FOUND IN A PARIS BOOKSTALL FIFTY YEARS AGO AND ON IT IT SAYS IN LATIN
DanDennett_2006 THE WORD OF GOD IS THE SEED AND THE SOWER OF THE SEED IS CHRIST SAME IDEA WELL NOT QUITE BUT IN FACT CHRISTIANS TOO
DanDennett_2006 GLORY IN THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE SURRENDERED TO GOD I'LL GIVE YOU A FEW QUOTES THE HEART OF WORSHIP IS SURRENDER SURRENDERED PEOPLE OBEY GOD 'S WORDS EVEN IF IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
DanDennett_2006 AND WHAT I WANT TO DO NOW IS SAY A BIT ABOUT THIS BOOK FROM THE DESIGN STANDPOINT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY A BRILLIANT BOOK
DanDennett_2006 FIRST OF ALL THE GOAL AND YOU HEARD JUST NOW WHAT THE GOAL IS IT'S TO BRING PURPOSE TO THE LIVES OF MILLIONS AND HE HAS SUCCEEDED IS IT A GOOD GOAL IN ITSELF I'M SURE WE ALL AGREE IT IS A WONDERFUL GOAL HE 'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE
DanDennett_2006 WHO DON'T HAVE PURPOSE IN THEIR LIFE AND BRINGING PURPOSE TO THEIR LIFE IS A WONDERFUL GOAL I GIVE HIM AN A PLUS
DanDennett_2006 IS THE GOAL ACHIEVED
DanDennett_2006 YES THIRTY MILLION COPIES OF THIS BOOK
DanDennett_2006 YOUR HEART
DanDennett_2006 I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS YOU'VE JUST HEARD THE MAN EXCELLENT INSIGHTS INTO HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY WISE ADVICE ON EVERY PAGE MOREOVER
DanDennett_2006 JUST ENOUGH REPETITION THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
DanDennett_2006 EVERY TIME YOU READ IT OR SAY IT YOU MAKE ANOTHER COPY IN YOUR BRAIN
DanDennett_2006 EVERY TIME YOU READ IT OR SAY IT YOU MAKE ANOTHER COPY IN YOUR BRAIN
DanDennett_2006 EVERYBODY EVERY TIME YOU READ IT OR SAY IT YOU MAKE ANOTHER COPY IN YOUR BRAIN
DanDennett_2006 THANK YOU AND NOW WE COME TO MY PROBLEM BECAUSE I'M ABSOLUTELY SINCERE IN MY APPRECIATION OF ALL THAT I'VE SAID ABOUT THIS BOOK
DanDennett_2006 BUT I WISH IT WERE BETTER I HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE BOOK AND IT WOULD JUST BE INSINCERE OF ME NOT TO ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS I WISH HE COULD DO THIS WITH A REVISION A MARK TWO VERSION OF HIS BOOK
DanDennett_2006 THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS IN THE BIBLE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO LIVE BY TOO MY PROBLEM IS
DanDennett_2006 SOME OF THE BITS IN IT I DON'T THINK ARE TRUE NOW SOME OF IT IS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
DanDennett_2006 AND THAT'S NOT MY MAIN COMPLAINT THAT'S WORTH MENTIONING HERE 'S A PASSAGE IT'S VERY MUCH WHAT HE SAID ANYWAY IF THERE WAS NO GOD WE WOULD ALL BE ACCIDENTS THE RESULT OF ASTRONOMICAL RANDOM CHANCE IN THE UNIVERSE
DanDennett_2006 PRESENTED A BEAUTIFUL ALTERNATIVE TO THAT VERY CLAIM YES THERE IS MEANING AND A REASON FOR RIGHT OR WRONG WE DON'T NEED
DanDennett_2006 BELIEF IN GOD TO BE GOOD OR TO HAVE MEANING IN US BUT THAT IS JUST A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT
DanDennett_2006 HOW ABOUT THIS GOD DESIGNED THIS PLANET 'S ENVIRONMENT JUST SO WE COULD LIVE IN IT I'M AFRAID THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE THAT SENTIMENT
DanDennett_2006 TO MEAN THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT AL GORE IS TRYING SO HARD TO GET US TO DO I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THAT SENTIMENT AT ALL AND THEN I FIND THIS
DanDennett_2006 ALL THE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES SUPPORTS THE CORE PROPOSITION THAT THE COSMOS IS ESPECIALLY DESIGNED WHOLE WITH LIFE AND MANKIND AS ITS FUNDAMENTAL GOAL AND PURPOSE A WHOLE IN WHICH ALL FACETS OF REALITY HAVE THEIR MEANING AND EXPLANATION IN THIS CENTRAL FACT
DanDennett_2006 WELL THAT'S MICHAEL DENTON HE 'S A CREATIONIST AND HERE I THINK WAIT A MINUTE I READ THIS AGAIN I READ IT THREE OR FOUR TIMES AND I THINK IS HE REALLY
DanDennett_2006 ON AND I READ THIS FIRST NOAH HAD NEVER SEEN RAIN BECAUSE PRIOR TO THE FLOOD GOD IRRIGATED THE EARTH FROM THE GROUND UP
DanDennett_2006 I WISH THAT SENTENCE WEREN'T IN THERE BECAUSE I THINK IT IS FALSE AND I THINK THAT THINKING THIS WAY ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE PLANET AFTER WE'VE JUST BEEN HEARING ABOUT THE
DanDennett_2006 RICK WARREN
DanDennett_2006 USES SCIENTIFIC TERMS AND SCIENTIFIC FACTOIDS AND INFORMATION IN A VERY INTERESTING WAY HERE 'S ONE
DanDennett_2006 WELL THERE'S A SENSE WHICH I AGREE WITH HIM EXCEPT I THINK IT HAS AN EVOLUTIONARY EXPLANATION AND WHAT I FIND DEEPLY TROUBLING IN THIS BOOK IS THAT HE SEEMS TO BE ARGUING THAT IF YOU WANT TO BE MORAL IF YOU WANT TO HAVE MEANING IN YOUR LIFE
DanDennett_2006 YOU HAVE TO BE AN INTELLIGENT DESIGNER YOU HAVE TO DENY THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION BY NATURAL SELECTION AND I THINK ON THE CONTRARY THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SOLVING THE WORLD 'S PROBLEMS THAT WE TAKE EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY SERIOUSLY
DanDennett_2006 WHOSE TRUTH ARE WE GOING TO LISTEN TO
DanDennett_2006 WELL MAYBE OK BUT WHAT'S GOING TO FOLLOW FROM THIS AND HERE 'S ONE THAT DOES CONCERN ME
DanDennett_2006 MAKE SENSE AND THAT'S A PROBLEM
DanDennett_2006 EVER ARGUE WITH THE DEVIL HE 'S BETTER AT ARGUING THAN YOU ARE HAVING HAD THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO PRACTICE NOW RICK WARREN DIDN'T INVENT THIS CLEVER MOVE
DanDennett_2006 YOU DON'T LIKE MY INTERPRETATION YOU'VE GOT A REASONABLE OBJECTION TO IT DON'T LISTEN DON'T LISTEN THAT'S THE DEVIL SPEAKING
DanDennett_2006 THIS DISCOURAGES THE SORT OF REASONING CITIZENSHIP IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE WANT TO HAVE
DanDennett_2006 ONE MORE PROBLEM THEN I'M THROUGH AND I'D REALLY LIKE TO GET A RESPONSE IF RICK IS ABLE TO DO IT
DanDennett_2006 IN THE GREAT COMMISSION JESUS SAID GO TO ALL PEOPLE OF ALL NATIONS AND MAKE THEM MY DISCIPLES BAPTIZE THEM IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT TEACH THEM TO DO EVERYTHING I'VE TOLD YOU THE BIBLE SAYS JESUS IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE THE WORLD
DanDennett_2006 NOW HERE WE'VE SEEN MANY WONDERFUL MAPS OF THE WORLD IN THE LAST DAY OR SO HERE 'S ONE NOT AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE OTHERS IT SIMPLY SHOWS THE RELIGIONS OF THE WORLD
DanDennett_2006 AND HERE 'S ONE THAT SHOWS THE SORT OF CURRENT BREAKDOWN OF THE DIFFERENT RELIGIONS
DanDennett_2006 NOW
DanDennett_2006 DO WE REALLY WANT TO COMMIT OURSELVES TO ENGULFING ALL THE OTHER RELIGIONS
DanDennett_2006 WHEN THEIR HOLY BOOKS ARE TELLING THEM DON 'T LISTEN TO THE OTHER SIDE THAT'S JUST SATAN TALKING IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT'S A VERY PROBLEMATIC
DanDennett_2006 SHIP TO GET ON FOR THE FUTURE I FOUND THIS
DanDennett_2006 AS I WAS DRIVING TO MAINE RECENTLY IN FRONT OF A CHURCH GOOD WITHOUT GOD BECOMES ZERO SORT OF CUTE A VERY CLEVER LITTLE
DanDennett_2006 I DON'T BELIEVE IT AND I THINK THIS IDEA POPULAR AS IT IS NOT IN THIS GUISE BUT IN GENERAL IS ITSELF ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE IF YOU ARE LIKE ME YOU KNOW MANY WONDERFUL
DanDennett_2006 BEHIND THEIR SANCTITY INSTEAD OF DOING GOOD WORKS SO I WISH WE COULD DROP THIS MEME I WISH THIS MEME WOULD GO EXTINCT THANKS VERY MUCH
