DavidCameron_2010 SOMEONE ONCE SAID THAT POLITICS IS OF COURSE
DavidCameron_2010 I FEEL LIKE I'VE REALLY ARRIVED
DavidCameron_2010 THE OTHER THING TO THINK OF IS WHAT AN HONOR IT IS AS A POLITICIAN TO GIVE A TED TALK PARTICULARLY HERE IN THE U K WHERE THE REPUTATION OF POLITICS WITH THE EXPENSES SCANDAL HAS SUNK SO LOW THERE WAS EVEN A STORY RECENTLY THAT
DavidCameron_2010 SCIENTISTS HAD THOUGHT ABOUT ACTUALLY REPLACING RATS IN THEIR EXPERIMENTS WITH POLITICIANS AND SOMEONE ASKED WHY AND THEY SAID WELL
DavidCameron_2010 ALL THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT RATS JUST WON 'T DO
DavidCameron_2010 NOW I
DavidCameron_2010 YOU ALL LOVE DATA SO I'M STARTING WITH A DATA RICH SLIDE THIS I THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACT TO BEAR IN MIND IN BRITISH POLITICS OR AMERICAN POLITICS AND THAT IS WE HAVE RUN OUT OF MONEY
DavidCameron_2010 WE HAVE VAST BUDGET DEFICITS THIS IS MY GLOBAL PUBLIC DEBT CLOCK AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S THIRTY TWO TRILLION AND COUNTING AND I THINK WHAT THIS LEADS TO
DavidCameron_2010 IS A VERY SIMPLE RECOGNITION THAT THERE'S ONE QUESTION IN POLITICS AT THE MOMENT ABOVE ALL OTHER AND IT'S THIS ONE
DavidCameron_2010 HOW DO WE MAKE THINGS BETTER WITHOUT SPENDING MORE MONEY BECAUSE THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE A LOT OF MONEY TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SERVICES
DavidCameron_2010 OR TO IMPROVE GOVERNMENT OR TO IMPROVE SO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT SO WHAT FOLLOWS FROM THAT IS THAT IF YOU THINK
DavidCameron_2010 IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY YOU CAN ONLY MEASURE SUCCESS IN PUBLIC SERVICES IN HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION AND POLICING BY SPENDING MORE MONEY YOU CAN ONLY MEASURE PROGRESS BY SPENDING MONEY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A PRETTY MISERABLE TIME
DavidCameron_2010 BUT IF YOU THINK A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER THINGS MATTER THAT LEAD UP TO WELL BEING THINGS LIKE YOUR FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS FRIENDSHIP COMMUNITY VALUES
DavidCameron_2010 IF WE COMBINE THE RIGHT POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY THE RIGHT POLITICAL THINKING
DavidCameron_2010 WITH THE INCREDIBLE INFORMATION REVOLUTION THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE AND THAT ALL OF YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE ABOUT THAN I DO I THINK THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY
DavidCameron_2010 TO ACTUALLY REMAKE POLITICS REMAKE GOVERNMENT REMAKE PUBLIC SERVICES AND ACHIEVE WHAT'S UP ON THAT SLIDE WHICH IS A BIG INCREASE IN OUR WELL BEING THAT'S THE ARGUMENT I WANT TO MAKE TONIGHT
DavidCameron_2010 THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY NOW I'M NOT SAYING FOR A MINUTE THAT BRITISH CONSERVATIVES HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS OF COURSE WE DON 'T BUT THERE ARE TWO THINGS AT HEART THAT I THINK DRIVE A CONSERVATIVE PHILOSOPHY THAT ARE REALLY RELEVANT TO THIS WHOLE DEBATE
DavidCameron_2010 THE FIRST IS THIS WE BELIEVE THAT IF YOU GIVE PEOPLE MORE POWER AND CONTROL OVER THEIR LIVES IF YOU GIVE PEOPLE MORE CHOICE IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE DRIVING SEAT
DavidCameron_2010 REMAKE POLITICS REMAKE GOVERNMENT REMAKE YOUR PUBLIC SERVICES THE SECOND THING WE BELIEVE IS WE BELIEVE GOING WITH THE GRAIN OF HUMAN NATURE
DavidCameron_2010 WHICH WE WERE JUST HEARING ABOUT AGAIN I THINK WE CAN ACHIEVE A REAL INCREASE
DavidCameron_2010 IN WELL BEING IN HAPPINESS IN A STRONGER SOCIETY WITHOUT NECESSARILY HAVING TO SPEND A WHOLE LOT MORE MONEY
DavidCameron_2010 WHY DO I THINK NOW IS THE MOMENT TO MAKE THIS ARGUMENT WELL I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GOING TO SUFFER A SHORT CONDENSED HISTORY LESSON ABOUT WHAT I WOULD SAY ARE THE THREE PASSAGES OF HISTORY
DavidCameron_2010 GONE FROM A WORLD OF LOCAL CONTROL THEN WE WENT TO A WORLD OF CENTRAL CONTROL AND NOW WE'RE IN A WORLD OF PEOPLE CONTROL LOCAL POWER CENTRAL POWER
DavidCameron_2010 NOW PEOPLE POWER NOW HERE IS KING KNUT KING A THOUSAND YEARS AGO THOUGHT HE COULD TURN BACK THE WAVES COULDN'T TURN BACK THE WAVES COULDN'T ACTUALLY TURN BACK VERY MUCH BECAUSE IF YOU WERE KING A THOUSAND YEARS AGO WHILE IT STILL
DavidCameron_2010 HOURS AND HOURS AND WEEKS AND WEEKS TO TRAVERSE YOUR OWN COUNTRY THERE WASN'T MUCH YOU WERE IN CHARGE OF YOU WEREN'T IN CHARGE OF POLICING JUSTICE EDUCATION HEALTH WELFARE
DavidCameron_2010 EVERYTHING HAD TO BE LOCAL YOU HAD TO HAVE LOCAL CONTROL BECAUSE THERE WAS NO NATIONALLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION BECAUSE TRAVEL WAS SO RESTRICTED SO THIS WAS THE PRE BUREAUCRATIC AGE
DavidCameron_2010 SUDDENLY YOU HAVE THE BIG STRONG CENTRAL STATE IT WAS ABLE
DavidCameron_2010 BUT ONLY IT WAS ABLE TO ORGANIZE HEALTH CARE EDUCATION POLICING JUSTICE AND IT WAS THE WORLD OF AS I SAY
DavidCameron_2010 LOCAL POWER BUT NOW CENTRAL POWER IT HAD SUCKED ALL THAT POWER UP FROM THE LOCALITIES IT WAS ABLE TO DO THAT ITSELF
DavidCameron_2010 HUNDRED YEARS AGO SENDING THESE TEN WORDS COST FIFTY DOLLARS RIGHT NOW HERE WE ARE LINKED UP TO LONG BEACH AND EVERYWHERE ELSE
DavidCameron_2010 FOR A FRACTION OF THAT COST AND WE CAN SEND AND RECEIVE HUGE QUANTITIES OF INFORMATION WITHOUT IT COSTING ANYTHING SO WE'RE NOW LIVING IN
DavidCameron_2010 A POST BUREAUCRATIC AGE WHERE GENUINE PEOPLE
DavidCameron_2010 POWER IS POSSIBLE
DavidCameron_2010 NOW WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR OUR POLITICS FOR OUR PUBLIC SERVICES FOR OUR GOVERNMENT WELL I CAN 'T IN THE TIME I'VE GOT
DavidCameron_2010 LET ME JUST GIVE A FEW OF THE WAYS LIFE CAN CHANGE AND THIS IS SO OBVIOUS IN A WAY BECAUSE YOU THINK ABOUT HOW ALL OF YOU HAVE CHANGED THE WAY WE SHOP THE WAY WE TRAVEL
DavidCameron_2010 THE WAY THAT BUSINESS IS DONE THAT IS ALREADY HAPPENED THE INFORMATION AND INTERNET REVOLUTION HAS ACTUALLY GONE ALL THE WAY THROUGH OUR SOCIETIES IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS BUT IT HASN'T
DavidCameron_2010 IN EVERY WAY YET TOUCHED OUR GOVERNMENT SO HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN WELL I THINK THERE ARE THREE CHIEF WAYS THAT IT SHOULD MAKE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE IN TRANSPARENCY IN GREATER CHOICE
DavidCameron_2010 AND IN ACCOUNTABILITY IN GIVING US THAT GENUINE PEOPLE POWER
DavidCameron_2010 IF WE TAKE TRANSPARENCY HERE IS ONE OF MY
DavidCameron_2010 CURRENTLY IS BEING SPENT ANYONE THINKING I COULD DO THAT SERVICE BETTER I COULD DELIVER IT CHEAPER IT'S ALL AVAILABLE THERE WE HAVE ONLY IN GOVERNMENT AND IN POLITICS
DavidCameron_2010 STARTED TO SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING IN THE COMMERCIAL WORLD WITH THE INFORMATION REVOLUTION SO COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE
DavidCameron_2010 AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET SO ANYONE CAN SEE WHAT THE TERMS ARE WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE DERIVING HUGE VALUE FOR MONEY BUT ALSO HUGE INCREASES I BELIEVE IN WELL BEING AS WELL
DavidCameron_2010 GOING TO SEE THIS CHANGE MASSIVELY WE SHOULD BE MAKING THIS CHANGE WITH THE INFORMATION REVOLUTION IN OUR COUNTRY
DavidCameron_2010 HEALTH SITES SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT OPERATIONS WORK OUT PROPERLY WHAT RECORDS DOCTORS HAVE THE CLEANLINESS OF HOSPITALS
DavidCameron_2010 WHO DOES BEST AT INFECTION CONTROL ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT WOULD ONCE BE LOCKED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR ALL OF US TO SEE
DavidCameron_2010 AND THE THIRD OF THESE BIG CHANGES ACCOUNTABILITY THIS I THINK IS A HUGE CHANGE IT IS A CRIME MAP THIS IS A CRIME MAP
DavidCameron_2010 PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT TO TRY AND HOLD THE POLICE TO ACCOUNT SUDDENLY WE'VE GOT THIS VAST OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE POWER
DavidCameron_2010 WHERE WE AS CITIZENS CAN SEE WHAT CRIMES ARE BEING COMMITTED WHERE WHEN AND BY WHOM AND WE CAN HOLD THE POLICE TO ACCOUNT AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS
DavidCameron_2010 WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE NOW I ALSO SAID THE OTHER PRINCIPLE THAT I THINK WE SHOULD WORK ON IS UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE IS RECOGNIZING THAT GOING WITH THE GRAIN OF HUMAN NATURE YOU CAN ACHIEVE SO MUCH MORE
DavidCameron_2010 GOT A HUGE REVOLUTION IN UNDERSTANDING OF WHY PEOPLE BEHAVE IN THE WAY THAT THEY DO AND A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO PUT THAT KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION TO GREATER USE WE'RE WORKING WITH SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WE'RE BEING ADVISED BY SOME OF THESE PEOPLE
DavidCameron_2010 AS WAS SAID TO TRY AND BRING ALL THE EXPERIENCE TO BOOK LET ME JUST GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE THAT I THINK IS INCREDIBLY SIMPLE AND
DavidCameron_2010 WE WANT TO GET PEOPLE TO BE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT WHY IT CUTS FUEL POVERTY IT CUTS THEIR BILLS AND IT CUTS CARBON EMISSIONS AT THE SAME TIME
DavidCameron_2010 HOW DO YOU DO IT WELL WE'VE HAD GOVERNMENT INFORMATION CAMPAIGNS OVER THE YEARS WHEN THEY TELL YOU TO SWITCH OFF THE LIGHTS WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOME WE EVEN HAD ONE GOVERNMENT MINISTER ONCE TOLD US TO
DavidCameron_2010 IS TO SHOW THEM THEIR OWN SPENDING TO SHOW THEM WHAT THEIR NEIGHBORS ARE SPENDING AND THEN SHOW WHAT AN ENERGY CONSCIOUS NEIGHBOR
DavidCameron_2010 THAT SORT OF BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS CAN TRANSFORM PEOPLE 'S BEHAVIOR IN A WAY THAT ALL THE BULLYING AND ALL THE INFORMATION AND ALL THE
DavidCameron_2010 ALL THE PROOF FROM AMERICA IS ACTUALLY IF YOU PAY PEOPLE TO RECYCLE IF YOU GIVE THEM A CARROT RATHER THAN A STICK YOU CAN TRANSFORM THEIR BEHAVIOR
DavidCameron_2010 SO WHAT DOES ALL THIS ADD UP TO HERE ARE MY TWO FAVORITE
DavidCameron_2010 SPEECHES
DavidCameron_2010 WHAT YOUR COUNTRY CAN DO FOR YOU ASK WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR COUNTRY AN INCREDIBLY NOBLE SENTIMENT BUT WHEN HE MADE THAT SPEECH
DavidCameron_2010 WHAT COULD YOU DO TO BUILD THE STRONGER BETTER SOCIETY YOU COULD FIGHT FOR YOUR COUNTRY YOU COULD DIE FOR YOUR COUNTRY YOU COULD SERVE IN YOUR
DavidCameron_2010 CIVIL SERVICE BUT YOU DIDN'T REALLY HAVE THE INFORMATION AND THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE ABILITY TO HELP BUILD THE STRONGER SOCIETY IN THE WAY THAT YOU DO
DavidCameron_2010 AND I THINK AN EVEN MORE
DavidCameron_2010 WONDERFUL SPEECH WHICH I'M GOING TO READ A BIG CHUNK OF WHICH SUMS UP WHAT I SAID AT THE BEGINNING ABOUT BELIEVING THERE IS MORE TO LIFE
DavidCameron_2010 MONEY AND MORE THAT WE SHOULD TRY AND MEASURE THAN MONEY AND IT IS ROBERT KENNEDY'S BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTION OF WHY GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT CAPTURES SO LITTLE
DavidCameron_2010 IT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN THE QUALITY OF THEIR EDUCATION OR THE JOY OF THEIR PLAY IT DOES NOT THE BEAUTY OF OUR POETRY OR THE STRENGTH OF OUR MARRIAGES THE INTELLIGENCE OF OUR PUBLIC DEBATE
DavidCameron_2010 IT MEASURES NEITHER OUR WIT NOR OUR COURAGE NEITHER OUR WISDOM NOR OUR LEARNING NEITHER OUR COMPASSION NOR OUR DEVOTION TO OUR COUNTRY IT MEASURES EVERYTHING IN SHORT
DavidCameron_2010 EXCEPT THAT WHICH MAKES LIFE WORTH WHILE AGAIN A SENTIMENT THAT WAS SO NOBLE AND BEAUTIFULLY PUT FORTY YEARS AGO AND A BEAUTIFUL DREAM FORTY YEARS AGO
DavidCameron_2010 BUT NOW WITH THE HUGE ADVANCES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WITH THE MASSIVE CHANGES IN BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS WITH ALL THAT WE KNOW ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD ADVANCE WELL BEING
DavidCameron_2010 IF WE COMBINE THOSE INSIGHTS OF GIVING POWER TO PEOPLE AND USING INFORMATION TO MAKE THAT POSSIBLE AND USING THE INSIGHT OF GOING WITH THE GRAIN OF HUMAN NATURE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME UNDERSTANDING WHY PEOPLE BEHAVE IN THE WAY THEY DO
DavidCameron_2010 IT IS A DREAM MORE EASY TO REALIZE TODAY THAN IT WAS WHEN IT WAS MADE IN THAT BEAUTIFUL SPEECH FORTY YEARS AGO THANK
