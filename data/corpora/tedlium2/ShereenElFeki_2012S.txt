ShereenElFeki_2012S@16.13:19.19 STORY
ShereenElFeki_2012S@20.04:21.56 ONCE UPON A TIME
ShereenElFeki_2012S@21.72:27.6 WELL ACTUALLY LESS THAN TWO YEARS AGO IN A KINGDOM NOT SO VERY FAR AWAY
ShereenElFeki_2012S@28.13:47.88 THERE WAS A MAN WHO TRAVELED MANY MILES TO COME TO WORK AT THE JEWEL IN THE KINGDOM 'S CROWN AN INTERNATIONALLY FAMOUS COMPANY LET 'S CALL IT ISLAND NETWORKS NOW THIS KINGDOM HAD MANY RESOURCES AND MIGHTY AMBITIONS BUT THE ONE THING IT LACKED WAS PEOPLE
ShereenElFeki_2012S@48.39:53.98 AND SO IT INVITED WORKERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO COME AND HELP IT BUILD THE NATION
ShereenElFeki_2012S@71.75:88.46 THE MEDICAL PERSONNEL WHO TOOK BLOOD SAMPLES FROM THE MAN NEVER ACTUALLY TOLD HIM WHAT THEY WERE TESTING FOR HE WASN 'T OFFERED COUNSELING BEFORE OR AFTER THE TEST WHICH IS BEST MEDICAL PRACTICE HE WAS NEVER INFORMED OF THE RESULTS OF THE TEST
ShereenElFeki_2012S@88.46:98.97 AND YET A COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER HE WAS PICKED UP AND TAKEN TO PRISON WHERE HE WAS SUBJECTED TO A MEDICAL EXAM INCLUDING A FULL BODY SEARCH
ShereenElFeki_2012S@98.97:101.8 IN FULL VIEW OF THE OTHERS IN THE CELL
ShereenElFeki_2012S@102.59:118.91 HE WAS RELEASED BUT THEN A DAY OR TWO LATER HE WAS TAKEN TO THE AIRPORT AND HE WAS DEPORTED WHAT ON EARTH DID THIS MAN DO TO MERIT THIS TREATMENT WHAT WAS HIS TERRIBLE CRIME
ShereenElFeki_2012S@119.41:121.84 HE WAS INFECTED WITH HIV
ShereenElFeki_2012S@122.52:132.97 NOW THE KINGDOM IS ONE OF ABOUT FIFTY COUNTRIES THAT IMPOSES RESTRICTIONS ON THE ENTRY OR STAY OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV
ShereenElFeki_2012S@132.97:142.59 THE KINGDOM ARGUES THAT ITS LAWS ALLOW IT TO DETAIN OR DEPORT FOREIGNERS WHO POSE A RISK TO THE ECONOMY
ShereenElFeki_2012S@142.66:161.16 OR THE SECURITY OR THE PUBLIC HEALTH OR THE MORALS OF THE STATE BUT THESE LAWS WHEN APPLIED TO PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV ARE A VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS AGREEMENTS TO WHICH THESE COUNTRIES ARE SIGNATORIES BUT YOU KNOW WHAT MATTERS OF PRINCIPLE ASIDE
ShereenElFeki_2012S@161.22:179.46 PRACTICALLY SPEAKING THESE LAWS DRIVE HIV UNDERGROUND PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY TO COME FORTH TO BE TESTED OR TREATED OR TO DISCLOSE THEIR CONDITION NONE OF WHICH HELPS THESE INDIVIDUALS OR THE COMMUNITIES THESE LAWS PURPORT TO PROTECT
ShereenElFeki_2012S@179.53:197.95 TODAY WE CAN PREVENT THE TRANSMISSION OF HIV AND WITH TREATMENT IT IS A MANAGEABLE CONDITION WE ARE VERY FAR FROM THE DAYS WHEN THE ONLY PRACTICAL RESPONSE TO DREAD DISEASE WAS TO HAVE BANISHED THE AFFLICTED LIKE THIS THE EXILE OF THE LEPER
ShereenElFeki_2012S@198.2:211.06 SO YOU TELL ME WHY IN OUR AGE OF SCIENCE WE STILL HAVE LAWS AND POLICIES WHICH COME FROM AN AGE OF SUPERSTITION TIME FOR A QUICK SHOW OF HANDS
ShereenElFeki_2012S@211.08:214.61 WHO HERE HAS BEEN TOUCHED BY HIV
ShereenElFeki_2012S@214.62:223.55 EITHER BECAUSE YOU YOURSELF HAVE THE VIRUS OR YOU HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER OR A FRIEND OR A COLLEAGUE WHO IS LIVING WITH HIV
ShereenElFeki_2012S@237.52:249.16 AND THE LAWS REFLECT THESE ATTITUDES I 'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT LAWS ON THE BOOKS BUT LAWS AS THEY ARE ENFORCED ON THE STREETS AND LAWS AS THEY ARE DECIDED IN THE COURTS
ShereenElFeki_2012S@249.16:257.04 AND I 'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT LAWS AS THEY RELATE TO PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE AT GREATEST RISK OF INFECTION
ShereenElFeki_2012S@257.04:272.57 PEOPLE SUCH AS THOSE WHO INJECT DRUGS OR SEX WORKERS OR MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN OR TRANSGENDERED PERSONS OR MIGRANTS OR PRISONERS AND IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT INCLUDES WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE
ShereenElFeki_2012S@272.88:291.07 NOW THERE ARE LAWS IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD WHICH REFLECT THE BEST OF HUMAN NATURE THESE LAWS TREAT PEOPLE TOUCHED BY HIV WITH COMPASSION AND ACCEPTANCE THESE LAWS RESPECT UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND THEY ARE GROUNDED IN EVIDENCE
ShereenElFeki_2012S@291.33:303.63 THESE LAWS ENSURE THAT PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV AND THOSE AT GREATEST RISK ARE PROTECTED FROM VIOLENCE AND DISCRIMINATION AND THAT THEY GET ACCESS TO PREVENTION AND TO TREATMENT
ShereenElFeki_2012S@303.83:305.76 UNFORTUNATELY
ShereenElFeki_2012S@305.89:311.91 THESE GOOD LAWS ARE COUNTER BALANCED BY A MASS OF REALLY BAD LAW
ShereenElFeki_2012S@312.03:319.6 LAW WHICH IS GROUNDED IN MORAL JUDGEMENT AND IN FEAR AND IN MISINFORMATION
ShereenElFeki_2012S@337.97:357.77 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DON 'T HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT WE 'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE SHARP END OF THE LAW THE FIRST IS NICK RHOADES HE 'S AN AMERICAN AND HE WAS CONVICTED UNDER THE U S STATE OF IOWA 'S LAW ON HIV TRANSMISSION AND EXPOSURE NEITHER OF WHICH OFFENSE HE ACTUALLY COMMITTED
ShereenElFeki_2012S@368.72:370.99 HOW BAD YOU ARE AS A PERSON
ShereenElFeki_2012S@371.77:376.88 YOU 'RE A CLASS B FELON LIFETIME SEX OFFENDER
ShereenElFeki_2012S@397.19:409.71 IT 'S NOT JUST A QUESTION OF UNFAIR OR INEFFECTIVE LAWS SOME COUNTRIES HAVE GOOD LAWS LAWS WHICH COULD STEM THE TIDE OF HIV THE PROBLEM IS THAT THESE LAWS ARE FLOUTED
ShereenElFeki_2012S@409.71:418.25 BECAUSE STIGMA GIVES UNOFFICIAL LICENSE TO TREAT PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV OR THOSE AT GREATEST RISK UNLIKE OTHER CITIZENS
ShereenElFeki_2012S@418.26:422.5 AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO HELMA AND DONGO FROM NAMIBIA
ShereenElFeki_2012S@476.55:486.41 HILMA AND NICK AND OUR MAN IN THE KINGDOM ARE AMONG THE THIRTY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV ACCORDING TO RECENT ESTIMATES
ShereenElFeki_2012S@506.54:509.25 WE ACTUALLY SEE SOME REASON FOR HOPE
ShereenElFeki_2012S@509.63:514.84 LOOKING GLOBALLY THE NUMBER OF NEW INFECTIONS OF HIV IS DECLINING
ShereenElFeki_2012S@515.35:534.23 AND LOOKING GLOBALLY AS WELL DEATHS ARE ALSO STARTING TO FALL THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THESE POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS BUT ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE IS IN THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ON ANTI RETROVIRAL THERAPY THE MEDICINES THEY NEED TO KEEP THEIR HIV IN CHECK
ShereenElFeki_2012S@534.23:549.66 NOW THERE ARE STILL MANY PROBLEMS ONLY ABOUT HALF OF THE PEOPLE WHO NEED TREATMENT ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING IT IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD LIKE HERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA NEW INFECTIONS ARE RISING AND SO ARE DEATHS
ShereenElFeki_2012S@549.66:555.88 AND THE MONEY THE MONEY WE NEED FOR THE GLOBAL RESPONSE TO HIV THAT IS SHRINKING
ShereenElFeki_2012S@558.46:572.77 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE DECADES INTO THIS EPIDEMIC WE HAVE A REAL CHANCE TO COME TO GRIPS WITH HIV BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE NEED TO TACKLE AN EPIDEMIC OF REALLY BAD LAW
ShereenElFeki_2012S@573.03:588.03 IT 'S FOR THIS REASON THAT THE GLOBAL COMMISSION ON HIV AND THE LAW OF WHICH I 'M A MEMBER WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE AGENCIES OF THE UNITED NATIONS TO LOOK AT THE WAYS THAT LEGAL ENVIRONMENTS ARE AFFECTING PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV AND THOSE AT GREATEST RISK
ShereenElFeki_2012S@588.03:595.91 AND TO RECOMMEND WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO MAKE THE LAW AN ALLY NOT AN ENEMY OF THE GLOBAL RESPONSE TO HIV
ShereenElFeki_2012S@595.91:603 LET ME GIVE YOU JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE WAY A LEGAL ENVIRONMENT CAN MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE
ShereenElFeki_2012S@604.49:621.07 PEOPLE WHO INJECT DRUGS ARE ONE OF THOSE GROUPS I MENTIONED THEY 'RE AT HIGH RISK OF HIV THROUGH CONTAMINATED INJECTION EQUIPMENT AND OTHER RISK RELATED BEHAVIORS IN FACT ONE IN EVERY TEN NEW INFECTIONS OF HIV IS AMONG PEOPLE WHO INJECT DRUGS
ShereenElFeki_2012S@621.09:629.83 NOW DRUG USE OR POSSESSION IS ILLEGAL IN ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY BUT SOME COUNTRIES TAKE A HARDER LINE ON THIS THAN OTHERS
ShereenElFeki_2012S@629.83:641.56 IN THAILAND PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS OR ARE MERELY SUSPECTED OF USING DRUGS ARE PLACED IN DETENTION CENTERS LIKE THE ONE YOU SEE HERE WHERE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO CLEAN UP
ShereenElFeki_2012S@641.56:649.41 THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THROWING PEOPLE INTO DETENTION CURES THEIR DRUG DEPENDENCE
ShereenElFeki_2012S@649.44:658.4 THERE IS HOWEVER AMPLE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT INCARCERATING PEOPLE INCREASES THEIR RISK OF HIV AND OTHER INFECTIONS
ShereenElFeki_2012S@658.84:668.21 WE KNOW HOW TO REDUCE HIV TRANSMISSION AND OTHER RISKS IN PEOPLE WHO INJECT DRUGS IT 'S CALLED HARM REDUCTION
ShereenElFeki_2012S@668.21:673.6 AND IT INVOLVES AMONG OTHER THINGS PROVIDING CLEAN NEEDLES AND SYRINGES
ShereenElFeki_2012S@673.6:680.78 OFFERING OPIOID SUBSTITUTION THERAPY AND OTHER EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS TO REDUCE DRUG DEPENDENCE
ShereenElFeki_2012S@680.78:694.48 IT INVOLVES PROVIDING INFORMATION AND EDUCATION AND CONDOMS TO REDUCE HIV TRANSMISSION AND ALSO PROVIDING HIV TESTING AND COUNSELING AND TREATMENT SHOULD PEOPLE BECOME INFECTED
ShereenElFeki_2012S@694.48:698.15 WHERE THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT ALLOWS FOR HARM REDUCTION
ShereenElFeki_2012S@698.16:700.08 THE RESULTS ARE STRIKING
ShereenElFeki_2012S@700.55:712.63 AUSTRALIA AND SWITZERLAND WERE TWO COUNTRIES WHICH INTRODUCED HARM REDUCTION VERY EARLY ON IN THEIR HIV EPIDEMICS AND THEY HAVE A VERY LOW RATE OF HIV AMONG INJECTING DRUG USERS
ShereenElFeki_2012S@713.23:721.19 THE U S AND MALAYSIA CAME TO HARM REDUCTION A LITTLE LATER AND THEY HAVE HIGHER RATES OF HIV IN THESE POPULATIONS
ShereenElFeki_2012S@721.45:728.22 THAILAND AND RUSSIA HOWEVER HAVE RESISTED HARM REDUCTION AND HAVE STRINGENT LAWS WHICH PUNISH DRUG USE
ShereenElFeki_2012S@728.23:734.75 AND HEY SURPRISE VERY HIGH RATES OF HIV AMONG PEOPLE WHO ARE INJECTING DRUGS
ShereenElFeki_2012S@735.19:738.72 AT THE GLOBAL COMMISSION WE HAVE STUDIED THE EVIDENCE
ShereenElFeki_2012S@753.73:767.91 NOW COMING UP WITH A VACCINE FOR HIV OR A CURE FOR AIDS NOW THAT 'S ROCKET SCIENCE BUT CHANGING THE LAW ISN 'T AND IN FACT A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES ARE STARTING TO MAKE PROGRESS ON A NUMBER OF POINTS
ShereenElFeki_2012S@768.23:775.63 TO BEGIN COUNTRIES NEED TO REVIEW THEIR LEGISLATION AS IT TOUCHES HIV AND VULNERABLE GROUPS
ShereenElFeki_2012S@775.74:792.95 ON THE BACK OF THOSE REVIEWS GOVERNMENTS SHOULD REPEAL LAWS THAT PUNISH OR DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV OR THOSE AT GREATEST RISK REPEALING A LAW ISN 'T EASY AND IT 'S PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT WHEN IT RELATES TO TOUCHY SUBJECTS LIKE DRUGS AND SEX
ShereenElFeki_2012S@792.96:797.17 BUT THERE 'S PLENTY YOU CAN DO WHILE THAT PROCESS IS UNDERWAY
ShereenElFeki_2012S@797.21:814.9 ONE OF THE KEY POINTS IS TO REFORM THE POLICE SO THAT THEY HAVE BETTER PRACTICES ON THE GROUND SO FOR EXAMPLE OUTREACH WORKERS WHO ARE DISTRIBUTING CONDOMS TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS ARE NOT THEMSELVES SUBJECT TO POLICE HARASSMENT OR ABUSE OR ARBITRARY ARREST
ShereenElFeki_2012S@814.9:824.27 WE CAN ALSO TRAIN JUDGES SO THAT THEY FIND FLEXIBILITIES IN THE LAW AND SO THAT THEY RULE ON THE SIDE OF TOLERANCE RATHER THAN PREJUDICE
ShereenElFeki_2012S@824.6:831.68 WE CAN RETOOL PRISONS SO THAT HIV PREVENTION AND HARM REDUCTION IS AVAILABLE TO PRISONERS
ShereenElFeki_2012S@842.72:855.3 BUT AWARENESS NEEDS ACTION AND SO WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING WITH HIV OR AT GREATEST RISK OF HIV HAVE ACCESS TO LEGAL SERVICES AND THEY HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO THE COURTS
ShereenElFeki_2012S@855.46:867.64 AND ALSO IMPORTANT IS TALKING TO COMMUNITIES SO THAT WE CHANGE INTERPRETATIONS OF RELIGIOUS OR CUSTOMARY LAW WHICH IS TOO OFTEN USED TO JUSTIFY PUNISHMENT AND FUEL STIGMA
ShereenElFeki_2012S@868.02:875.67 FOR MANY OF US HERE HIV IS NOT AN ABSTRACT THREAT IT HITS VERY CLOSE TO HOME
ShereenElFeki_2012S@875.67:892.54 THE LAW ON THE OTHER HAND CAN SEEM REMOTE ARCANE THE STUFF OF SPECIALISTS BUT IT ISN 'T BECAUSE FOR THOSE OF US WHO LIVE IN DEMOCRACIES OR IN ASPIRING DEMOCRACIES THE LAW BEGINS WITH US
ShereenElFeki_2012S@892.54:907.77 LAWS THAT TREAT PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV OR THOSE AT GREATEST RISK WITH RESPECT START WITH THE WAY THAT WE TREAT THEM OURSELVES AS EQUALS IF WE ARE GOING TO STOP THE SPREAD OF HIV IN OUR LIFETIME
ShereenElFeki_2012S@908.04:912.51 THEN THAT IS THE CHANGE WE NEED TO SPREAD THANK YOU
