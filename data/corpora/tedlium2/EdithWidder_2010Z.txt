EdithWidder_2010Z@50.32:56.81 WE TRAINED IN A TANK IN PORT HUENEME AND THEN MY FIRST OPEN OCEAN DIVE WAS IN SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL
EdithWidder_2010Z@56.96:58.53 IT WAS AN EVENING DIVE
EdithWidder_2010Z@58.6:62.71 I WENT DOWN TO A DEPTH OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FEET AND TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS
EdithWidder_2010Z@62.96:69.69 AND THE REASON I TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS IS BECAUSE I KNEW I WOULD SEE THIS PHENOMENON OF ANIMALS MAKING LIGHT CALLED BIOLUMINESCENCE
EdithWidder_2010Z@69.82:75.52 BUT I WAS TOTALLY UNPREPARED FOR HOW MUCH THERE WAS AND HOW SPECTACULAR IT WAS
EdithWidder_2010Z@76.18:81.34 I SAW CHAINS OF JELLYFISH CALLED SIPHONOPHORES THAT WERE LONGER THAN THIS ROOM
EdithWidder_2010Z@81.54:87 PUMPING OUT SO MUCH LIGHT THAT I COULD READ THE DIALS AND GAUGES INSIDE THE SUIT WITHOUT A FLASHLIGHT
EdithWidder_2010Z@92.49:103.26 AND EXPLOSIONS OF SPARKS THAT WOULD SWIRL UP OUT OF THE THRUSTERS JUST LIKE WHEN YOU THROW A LOG ON A CAMPFIRE AND THE EMBERS SWIRL UP OFF THE CAMPFIRE BUT THESE WERE ICY BLUE EMBERS IT WAS BREATHTAKING
EdithWidder_2010Z@103.37:115.49 NOW USUALLY IF PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH BIOLUMINESCENCE AT ALL IT 'S THESE GUYS IT 'S FIREFLIES AND THERE ARE A FEW OTHER LAND DWELLERS THAT CAN MAKE LIGHT SOME INSECTS EARTHWORMS FUNGI BUT IN GENERAL ON LAND IT 'S REALLY RARE
EdithWidder_2010Z@119.34:125.96 IF I GO OUT IN THE OPEN OCEAN ENVIRONMENT VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND I DRAG A NET FROM THREE THOUSAND FEET TO THE SURFACE
EdithWidder_2010Z@127.04:134.05 MOST OF THE ANIMALS IN FACT IN MANY PLACES EIGHTY TO NINETY PERCENT OF THE ANIMALS THAT I BRING UP IN THAT NET MAKE LIGHT
EdithWidder_2010Z@134.46:137.73 THIS MAKES FOR SOME PRETTY SPECTACULAR LIGHT SHOWS
EdithWidder_2010Z@137.82:150.79 NOW I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE VIDEO THAT I SHOT FROM A SUBMERSIBLE I FIRST DEVELOPED THIS TECHNIQUE WORKING FROM A LITTLE SINGLE PERSON SUBMERSIBLE CALLED DEEP ROVER AND THEN ADAPTED IT FOR USE ON THE JOHNSON SEA LINK WHICH YOU SEE HERE
EdithWidder_2010Z@150.92:167.99 SO MOUNTED IN FRONT OF THE OBSERVATION SPHERE THERE 'S A A THREE FOOT DIAMETER HOOP WITH A SCREEN STRETCHED ACROSS IT AND INSIDE THE SPHERE WITH ME IS AN INTENSIFIED CAMERA THAT 'S ABOUT AS SENSITIVE AS A FULLY DARK ADAPTED HUMAN EYE ALBEIT A LITTLE FUZZY SO YOU TURN ON THE CAMERA TURN OUT THE LIGHTS
EdithWidder_2010Z@181.75:191.31 NOW WHEN I WAS FIRST DOING THIS ALL I WAS TRYING TO DO WAS COUNT THE NUMBERS OF SOURCES I KNEW MY FORWARD SPEED I KNEW THE AREA AND SO I COULD FIGURE OUT HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF SOURCES THERE WERE PER CUBIC METER
EdithWidder_2010Z@191.31:195.83 BUT I STARTED TO REALIZE THAT I COULD ACTUALLY IDENTIFY ANIMALS BY THE TYPE OF FLASHES THEY PRODUCED
EdithWidder_2010Z@195.83:212.13 AND SO HERE IN THE GULF OF MAINE AT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET I CAN NAME PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING YOU 'RE SEEING THERE TO THE SPECIES LEVEL LIKE THOSE BIG EXPLOSIONS SPARKS ARE FROM A LITTLE COMB JELLY AND THERE 'S KRILL AND OTHER KINDS OF CRUSTACEANS AND JELLYFISH
EdithWidder_2010Z@259.27:270.31 UNFILTERED SEAWATER THAT OFTEN HAS BIOLUMINESCENT PLANKTON IN IT SO IF YOU STAGGER INTO THE HEAD LATE AT NIGHT AND YOU 'RE SO TOILET HUGGING SICK THAT YOU FORGET TO TURN ON THE LIGHT YOU MAY THINK THAT YOU 'RE HAVING A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE
EdithWidder_2010Z@285.04:289.04 THE SUBSTRATE HE CALLED LUCIFERIN AFTER LUCIFER THE LIGHTBEARER
EdithWidder_2010Z@289.04:308.17 THAT TERMINOLOGY HAS STUCK BUT IT DOESN 'T ACTUALLY REFER TO SPECIFIC CHEMICALS BECAUSE THESE CHEMICALS COME IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT SHAPES AND FORMS IN FACT MOST OF THE PEOPLE STUDYING BIOLUMINESCENCE TODAY ARE FOCUSED ON THE CHEMISTRY BECAUSE THESE CHEMICALS HAVE PROVED SO INCREDIBLY VALUABLE FOR DEVELOPING ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS CANCER FIGHTING DRUGS
EdithWidder_2010Z@308.17:315.27 TESTING FOR THE PRESENCE OF LIFE ON MARS DETECTING POLLUTANTS IN OUR WATERS WHICH IS HOW WE USE IT AT ORCA IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
EdithWidder_2010Z@315.27:334.75 THE NOBEL PRIZE IN CHEMISTRY WAS AWARDED FOR WORK DONE ON A MOLECULE CALLED GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN THAT WAS ISOLATED FROM THE BIOLUMINESCENT CHEMISTRY OF A JELLYFISH AND IT 'S BEEN EQUATED TO THE INVENTION OF THE MICROSCOPE IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS HAD ON CELL BIOLOGY AND GENETIC ENGINEERING
EdithWidder_2010Z@348.55:356.48 SPECTACULARLY IMPORTANT THIS TRAIT IS FOR SURVIVAL SO WHAT IS IT ABOUT BIOLUMINESCENCE THAT 'S SO IMPORTANT TO SO MANY ANIMALS
EdithWidder_2010Z@356.48:370.95 WELL FOR ANIMALS THAT ARE TRYING TO AVOID PREDATORS BY STAYING IN THE DARKNESS LIGHT CAN STILL BE VERY USEFUL FOR THE THREE BASIC THINGS THAT ANIMALS HAVE TO DO TO SURVIVE AND THAT 'S FIND FOOD ATTRACT A MATE AND AVOID
EdithWidder_2010Z@370.95:384.53 BEING EATEN SO FOR EXAMPLE THIS FISH HAS A BUILT IN HEADLIGHT BEHIND ITS EYE THAT IT CAN USE FOR FINDING FOOD OR ATTRACTING A MATE AND THEN WHEN IT 'S NOT USING IT IT ACTUALLY CAN ROLL IT DOWN INTO ITS HEAD JUST LIKE THE HEADLIGHTS ON YOUR LAMBORGHINI
EdithWidder_2010Z@385.27:387.86 THIS FISH ACTUALLY HAS HIGH BEAMS
EdithWidder_2010Z@388.16:392.93 AND THIS FISH WHICH IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES HAS THREE HEADLIGHTS ON EACH SIDE OF ITS HEAD
EdithWidder_2010Z@393.19:395.22 NOW THIS ONE IS BLUE
EdithWidder_2010Z@413.71:421.8 AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THERE 'S TWO AND THAT 'S SOMETHING I WANT TO SOLVE SOME DAY BUT NOT ONLY CAN IT SEE BLUE LIGHT BUT IT CAN SEE RED LIGHT
EdithWidder_2010Z@421.87:431.43 SO IT USES ITS RED BIOLUMINESCENCE LIKE A SNIPER 'S SCOPE TO BE ABLE TO SNEAK UP ON ANIMALS THAT ARE BLIND TO RED LIGHT AND BE ABLE TO SEE THEM WITHOUT BEING SEEN
EdithWidder_2010Z@431.74:442.1 IT 'S ALSO GOT A LITTLE CHIN BARBEL HERE WITH A BLUE LUMINESCENT LURE ON IT THAT IT CAN USE TO ATTRACT PREY FROM A LONG WAY OFF AND A LOT OF ANIMALS WILL USE THEIR BIOLUMINESCENCE AS A LURE
EdithWidder_2010Z@442.51:452.69 THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVORITE FISH THIS IS A VIPERFISH AND IT 'S GOT A LURE ON THE END OF A LONG FISHING ROD THAT IT ARCHES IN FRONT OF THE TOOTHY JAW THAT GIVES THE VIPERFISH ITS NAME
EdithWidder_2010Z@452.89:460.12 THE TEETH ON THIS FISH ARE SO LONG THAT IF THEY CLOSED INSIDE THE MOUTH OF THE FISH IT WOULD ACTUALLY IMPALE ITS OWN BRAIN
EdithWidder_2010Z@460.27:468.86 SO INSTEAD IT SLIDES IN GROOVES ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE HEAD THIS IS A CHRISTMAS TREE OF A FISH EVERYTHING ON THIS FISH LIGHTS UP IT 'S NOT JUST
EdithWidder_2010Z@468.86:485.04 THAT LURE IT 'S GOT A BUILT IN FLASHLIGHT IT 'S GOT THESE JEWEL LIKE LIGHT ORGANS ON ITS BELLY THAT IT USES FOR A TYPE OF CAMOUFLAGE THAT OBLITERATES ITS SHADOW SO WHEN IT 'S SWIMMING AROUND AND THERE 'S A PREDATOR LOOKING UP FROM BELOW IT MAKES ITSELF DISAPPEAR
EdithWidder_2010Z@485.04:495.01 IT 'S GOT LIGHT ORGANS IN THE MOUTH IT 'S GOT LIGHT ORGANS IN EVERY SINGLE SCALE IN THE FINS IN A MUCUS LAYER ON THE BACK AND THE BELLY ALL USED FOR DIFFERENT THINGS SOME OF WHICH WE KNOW ABOUT SOME OF WHICH WE DON
EdithWidder_2010Z@514.9:526.42 THESE ARE THE EYES OF A LIVING ANGLERFISH SO SHE 'S GOT A LURE THAT SHE STICKS OUT IN FRONT OF THIS LIVING MOUSETRAP OF NEEDLE SHARP TEETH IN ORDER TO ATTRACT IN SOME UNSUSPECTING PREY
EdithWidder_2010Z@540.7:556.22 OR MORE LIKELY THEIR GRADUATE STUDENTS HAVE REVEALED THAT THEY ALL EAT PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING SO NOW WE BELIEVE THAT THE DIFFERENT SHAPE OF THE LURE IS HOW THE MALE RECOGNIZES THE FEMALE IN THE ANGLERFISH WORLD BECAUSE MANY OF THESE MALES ARE WHAT ARE KNOWN AS DWARF MALES
EdithWidder_2010Z@557.05:560.54 THIS LITTLE GUY HAS NO VISIBLE MEANS OF SELF SUPPORT
EdithWidder_2010Z@561.03:569.62 HE HAS NO LURE FOR ATTRACTING FOOD AND NO TEETH FOR EATING IT WHEN IT GETS THERE HIS ONLY HOPE FOR EXISTENCE ON THIS PLANET IS AS A GIGOLO
EdithWidder_2010Z@575.25:577.04 SO THIS LITTLE GUY
EdithWidder_2010Z@577.32:584.35 HAS FOUND HIMSELF THIS BABE AND YOU WILL NOTE THAT HE 'S HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO ATTACH HIMSELF IN A WAY THAT HE DOESN 'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT HER
EdithWidder_2010Z@586.73:591.32 BUT HE STILL KNOWS A GOOD THING WHEN HE SEES IT AND SO HE SEALS THE RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ETERNAL KISS
EdithWidder_2010Z@591.47:598.36 HIS FLESH FUSES WITH HER FLESH HER BLOODSTREAM GROWS INTO HIS BODY AND HE BECOMES NOTHING MORE THAN A LITTLE SPERM SAC
EdithWidder_2010Z@610.71:623.67 SO THEY CAN USE IT FOR FINDING FOOD FOR ATTRACTING MATES THEY USE IT A LOT FOR DEFENSE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS A LOT OF THEM CAN RELEASE THEIR LUCIFERIN OR LUFERASE IN THE WATER JUST THE WAY A SQUID OR AN OCTOPUS WILL RELEASE AN INK CLOUD THIS SHRIMP IS ACTUALLY
EdithWidder_2010Z@643.51:658.54 BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY HAS A TUBE ON ITS SHOULDER THAT CAN SQUIRT OUT LIGHT AND I WAS LUCK ENOUGH TO CAPTURE ONE OF THESE WHEN WE WERE ON A TRAWLING EXPEDITION OFF THE NORTHWEST COAST OF AFRICA FOR BLUE PLANET FOR THE DEEP PORTION OF BLUE PLANET AND WE WERE USING A SPECIAL TRAWLING NET THAT
EdithWidder_2010Z@658.59:660.17 WE WERE ABLE TO BRING THESE ANIMALS
EdithWidder_2010Z@677.59:689.15 FOR THIS FISH IT 'S ACTUALLY WHOLE CELLS WITH NUCLEI AND MEMBRANES IT 'S ENERGETICALLY VERY COSTLY FOR THIS FISH TO DO THIS AND WE HAVE NO IDEA WHY IT DOES IT ANOTHER ONE OF THESE GREAT MYSTERIES THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED
EdithWidder_2010Z@691.78:695.48 NOW ANOTHER FORM OF DEFENSE IS SOMETHING CALLED A BURGLAR ALARM
EdithWidder_2010Z@695.48:713.84 SAME REASON YOU HAVE A BURGLAR ALARM ON YOUR CAR THE HONKING HORN AND FLASHING LIGHTS ARE MEANT TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF HOPEFULLY THE POLICE THAT WILL COME AND TAKE THE BURGLAR AWAY WHEN AN ANIMAL 'S CAUGHT IN THE CLUTCHES OF A PREDATOR ITS ONLY HOPE FOR ESCAPE MAY BE TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF SOMETHING BIGGER AND NASTIER THAT WILL ATTACK THEIR ATTACKER THEREBY AFFORDING THEM A CHANCE FOR ESCAPE
EdithWidder_2010Z@713.84:723.01 THIS JELLYFISH FOR EXAMPLE HAS A SPECTACULAR BIOLUMINESCENT DISPLAY THIS IS US CHASING IT IN THE SUBMERSIBLE THAT 'S NOT LUMINESCENCE THAT 'S REFLECTED LIGHT FROM THE GONADS
EdithWidder_2010Z@723.01:742.23 WE CAPTURE IT IN A VERY SPECIAL DEVICE ON THE FRONT OF THE SUBMERSIBLE THAT ALLOWS US TO BRING IT UP IN REALLY PRISTINE CONDITION BRING IT INTO THE LAB ON THE SHIP AND THEN TO GENERATE THE DISPLAY YOU 'RE ABOUT TO SEE ALL I DID WAS TOUCH IT ONCE PER SECOND ON ITS NERVE RING WITH A SHARP PICK THAT 'S SORT OF LIKE THE SHARP TOOTH OF A FISH AND ONCE THIS DISPLAY GETS GOING I 'M NOT TOUCHING IT ANYMORE
EdithWidder_2010Z@756.67:766.88 BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 'S FRUSTRATED ME AS A DEEP SEA EXPLORER IS HOW MANY ANIMALS THERE PROBABLY ARE IN THE OCEAN THAT WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE EXPLORE THE OCEAN
EdithWidder_2010Z@766.95:772.72 THE PRIMARY WAY THAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT LIVES IN THE OCEAN IS WE GO OUT AND DRAG NETS BEHIND SHIPS
EdithWidder_2010Z@772.75:777.88 AND I DEFY YOU TO NAME ANY OTHER BRANCH OF SCIENCE THAT STILL DEPENDS ON HUNDREDS OF YEAR OLD TECHNOLOGY
EdithWidder_2010Z@778.04:785.03 THE OTHER PRIMARY WAY IS WE GO DOWN WITH SUBMERSIBLES AND REMOTE OPERATED VEHICLES I 'VE MADE HUNDREDS OF DIVES IN SUBMERSIBLES
EdithWidder_2010Z@785.27:795.31 WHEN I 'M SITTING IN A SUBMERSIBLE THOUGH I KNOW THAT I 'M NOT UNOBTRUSIVE AT ALL I 'VE GOT BRIGHT LIGHTS AND NOISY THRUSTERS ANY ANIMAL WITH ANY SENSE IS GOING TO BE LONG GONE
EdithWidder_2010Z@795.91:813.27 SO I 'VE WANTED FOR A LONG TIME TO FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT WAY TO EXPLORE AND SO SOMETIME AGO I GOT THIS IDEA FOR A CAMERA SYSTEM IT 'S NOT EXACTLY ROCKET SCIENCE WE CALL THIS THING EYE IN THE SEA AND SCIENTISTS HAVE DONE THIS ON LAND FOR YEARS WE JUST USE A COLOR THAT THE ANIMALS CAN 'T SEE AND THEN A CAMERA THAT CAN SEE THAT COLOR
EdithWidder_2010Z@813.27:825.58 YOU CAN 'T USE INFRARED IN THE SEA WE USE FAR RED LIGHT BUT EVEN THAT 'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT GETS ABSORBED SO QUICKLY MADE AN INTENSIFIED CAMERA WANTED TO MAKE THIS ELECTRONIC JELLYFISH THING IS IN SCIENCE
EdithWidder_2010Z@826:842.65 YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO TELL THE FUNDING AGENCIES WHAT YOU 'RE GOING TO DISCOVER BEFORE THEY 'LL GIVE YOU THE MONEY AND I DIDN 'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING TO DISCOVER SO I COULDN 'T GET THE FUNDING FOR THIS SO I KLUGED THIS TOGETHER I GOT THE HARVEY MUDD ENGINEERING CLINIC TO ACTUALLY DO IT AS AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT PROJECT INITIALLY AND THEN I KLUGED
EdithWidder_2010Z@878.62:881.31 IT ALL CAME TOGETHER AND EVERYTHING WORKED
EdithWidder_2010Z@881.31:900.68 AND REMARKABLY THAT MOMENT GOT CAUGHT ON FILM BY PHOTOGRAPHER MARK RICHARDS WHO HAPPENED TO BE THERE AT THE PRECISE MOMENT THAT WE DISCOVERED THAT IT ALL CAME TOGETHER THAT 'S ME ON THE LEFT MY GRADUATE STUDENT AT THE TIME ERIKA RAYMOND AND LEE FRY WHO WAS THE ENGINEER ON THE PROJECT AND WE HAVE THIS PHOTOGRAPH POSTED IN OUR LAB IN A PLACE OF HONOR
EdithWidder_2010Z@900.68:916.29 WITH THE CAPTION ENGINEER SATISFYING TWO WOMEN AT ONCE LAUGHTER AND WE WERE VERY VERY HAPPY SO NOW WE HAD A SYSTEM THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY TAKE TO SOME PLACE THAT WAS KIND OF LIKE AN OASIS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN THAT MIGHT BE PATROLLED BY LARGE PREDATORS
EdithWidder_2010Z@916.29:923.75 AND SO THE PLACE THAT WE TOOK IT TO WAS THIS PLACE CALLED A BRINE POOL WHICH IS IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE GULF OF MEXICO IT 'S A MAGICAL PLACE
EdithWidder_2010Z@923.75:930.8 AND I KNOW THIS FOOTAGE ISN 'T GOING TO LOOK LIKE ANYTHING TO YOU WE HAD A CRUMMY CAMERA AT THE TIME BUT I WAS ECSTATIC
EdithWidder_2010Z@947.53:958.94 FOUR HOURS INTO THE DEPLOYMENT WE HAD PROGRAMMED THE ELECTRONIC JELLYFISH TO COME ON FOR THE FIRST TIME EIGHTY SIX SECONDS AFTER IT WENT INTO ITS PINWHEEL DISPLAY WE RECORDED THIS
EdithWidder_2010Z@959.99:967.65 THIS IS A SQUID OVER SIX FEET LONG THAT IS SO NEW TO SCIENCE IT CANNOT BE PLACED IN ANY KNOWN SCIENTIFIC FAMILY
EdithWidder_2010Z@967.94:978.13 I COULD NOT HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER PROOF OF CONCEPT AND BASED ON THIS I WENT BACK TO THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AND SAID THIS IS WHAT WE WILL DISCOVER AND THEY GAVE ME ENOUGH MONEY TO DO IT RIGHT
EdithWidder_2010Z@978.13:991.13 WHICH HAS INVOLVED DEVELOPING THE WORLD 'S FIRST DEEP SEA WEBCAM WHICH HAS BEEN INSTALLED IN THE MONTEREY CANYON FOR THE PAST YEAR AND NOW MORE RECENTLY A MODULAR FORM OF THIS SYSTEM A MUCH MORE MOBILE FORM
EdithWidder_2010Z@991.13:1005.14 THAT 'S A LOT EASIER TO LAUNCH AND RECOVER THAT I HOPE CAN BE USED ON SYLVIA 'S HOPE SPOTS TO HELP EXPLORE AND PROTECT THESE AREAS AND FOR ME LEARN MORE ABOUT THE BIOLUMINESCENCE IN THESE HOPE SPOTS
EdithWidder_2010Z@1005.36:1009.03 SO ONE OF THESE TAKE HOME MESSAGES HERE IS
EdithWidder_2010Z@1009.28:1017.55 THERE IS STILL A LOT TO EXPLORE IN THE OCEANS AND SYLVIA HAS SAID THAT WE ARE DESTROYING THE OCEANS BEFORE WE EVEN KNOW WHAT 'S IN THEM AND SHE 'S RIGHT
EdithWidder_2010Z@1018.11:1022.46 SO IF YOU EVER EVER GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A DIVE IN A SUBMERSIBLE
EdithWidder_2010Z@1022.54:1025.29 SAY YES A THOUSAND TIMES YES
EdithWidder_2010Z@1025.35:1028.61 AND PLEASE TURN OUT THE LIGHTS I PROMISE YOU 'LL LOVE IT
