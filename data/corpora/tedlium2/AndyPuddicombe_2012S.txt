AndyPuddicombe_2012S JUST TEN MINUTES UNDISTURBED AND WHEN I SAY NOTHING I DO MEAN NOTHING SO THAT 'S NO EMAILING TEXTING NO INTERNET NO TV NO CHATTING NO EATING NO READING
AndyPuddicombe_2012S SIMPLY DOING NOTHING
AndyPuddicombe_2012S I SEE A LOT OF VERY BLANK FACES LAUGHTER MY THINKING IS YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO GO A LONG WAY BACK AND THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY THING RIGHT WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR MIND THE MIND OUR MOST VALUABLE AND PRECIOUS RESOURCE THROUGH WHICH WE EXPERIENCE EVERY SINGLE MOMENT OF OUR LIFE THE MIND THAT WE RELY UPON TO
AndyPuddicombe_2012S BE HAPPY CONTENT EMOTIONALLY STABLE AS INDIVIDUALS AND AT THE SAME TIME TO BE KIND AND THOUGHTFUL AND CONSIDERATE IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHERS
AndyPuddicombe_2012S THIS IS THE SAME MIND THAT WE DEPEND UPON TO BE FOCUSED CREATIVE SPONTANEOUS AND TO PERFORM AT OUR VERY BEST IN EVERYTHING THAT WE DO AND YET WE DON 'T TAKE ANY TIME OUT TO LOOK AFTER IT
AndyPuddicombe_2012S THAT 'S REALLY NOT HOW IT HAS TO BE SO
AndyPuddicombe_2012S I WAS ABOUT ELEVEN WHEN I WENT ALONG TO MY FIRST MEDITATION CLASS
AndyPuddicombe_2012S AND TRUST ME IT HAD ALL THE STEREOTYPES THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE THE SITTING CROSS LEGGED ON THE FLOOR
AndyPuddicombe_2012S THE INCENSE THE HERBAL TEA THE VEGETARIANS THE WHOLE DEAL BUT MY MOM WAS GOING AND I WAS INTRIGUED SO I WENT ALONG WITH HER I 'D ALSO SEEN A FEW KUNG FU MOVIES AND SECRETLY I KIND OF THOUGHT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO LEARN HOW TO FLY BUT I WAS VERY YOUNG AT THE TIME NOW
AndyPuddicombe_2012S AS I WAS THERE I GUESS LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE I ASSUMED THAT IT WAS JUST AN ASPIRIN FOR THE MIND YOU GET STRESSED YOU DO SOME MEDITATION I HADN 'T REALLY THOUGHT THAT IT COULD BE SORT OF PREVENTATIVE IN NATURE
AndyPuddicombe_2012S REALLY SERIOUS THINGS WHICH JUST FLIPPED MY LIFE UPSIDE DOWN AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I WAS INUNDATED WITH THOUGHTS INUNDATED WITH DIFFICULT EMOTIONS THAT I DIDN 'T KNOW HOW TO COPE WITH EVERY TIME I SORT OF PUSHED ONE DOWN ANOTHER ONE WOULD JUST SORT OF POP BACK UP AGAIN IT WAS A REALLY VERY STRESSFUL TIME
AndyPuddicombe_2012S I GUESS WE ALL DEAL WITH STRESS IN DIFFERENT WAYS
AndyPuddicombe_2012S SOME PEOPLE WILL BURY THEMSELVES IN WORK GRATEFUL FOR THE DISTRACTION OTHERS WILL TURN TO THEIR FRIENDS THEIR FAMILY LOOKING FOR SUPPORT SOME PEOPLE HIT THE BOTTLE START TAKING MEDICATION
AndyPuddicombe_2012S MY OWN WAY OF DEALING WITH IT WAS TO BECOME A MONK SO I QUIT MY DEGREE I HEADED OFF TO THE HIMALAYAS I BECAME A MONK AND I STARTED STUDYING MEDITATION
AndyPuddicombe_2012S PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME WHAT I LEARNED FROM THAT TIME WELL OBVIOUSLY IT CHANGED THINGS LET 'S FACE IT BECOMING A CELIBATE MONK IS GOING TO CHANGE A NUMBER OF THINGS BUT IT WAS MORE THAN THAT
AndyPuddicombe_2012S FOR THE PRESENT MOMENT BY THAT I MEAN NOT BEING LOST IN THOUGHT NOT BEING DISTRACTED NOT BEING OVERWHELMED BY DIFFICULT EMOTIONS BUT INSTEAD LEARNING HOW TO BE IN THE HERE AND NOW HOW TO BE MINDFUL HOW TO BE PRESENT
AndyPuddicombe_2012S I THINK THE PRESENT MOMENT IS SO UNDERRATED IT SOUNDS SO ORDINARY AND YET WE SPEND SO LITTLE TIME
AndyPuddicombe_2012S IN THE PRESENT MOMENT THAT IT 'S ANYTHING BUT ORDINARY THERE WAS A RESEARCH PAPER THAT CAME OUT OF HARVARD JUST RECENTLY THAT SAID ON AVERAGE OUR MINDS ARE LOST IN THOUGHT ALMOST FORTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE TIME FORTY SEVEN PERCENT
AndyPuddicombe_2012S AT THE SAME TIME THIS SORT OF CONSTANT MIND WANDERING IS ALSO A DIRECT CAUSE OF UNHAPPINESS NOW
AndyPuddicombe_2012S AND POTENTIALLY QUITE UNHAPPY DUNNO IT JUST KIND OF SEEMS TRAGIC ACTUALLY ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE 'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT
AndyPuddicombe_2012S WHEN THERE 'S A POSITIVE PRACTICAL ACHIEVABLE SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN TECHNIQUE
AndyPuddicombe_2012S WHICH ALLOWS OUR MIND TO BE MORE HEALTHY TO BE MORE MINDFUL AND LESS DISTRACTED AND THE BEAUTY OF IT IS THAT EVEN THOUGH IT NEED ONLY TAKE ABOUT TEN MINUTES A DAY IT IMPACTS OUR ENTIRE LIFE
AndyPuddicombe_2012S BUT WE NEED TO KNOW HOW TO DO IT WE NEED AN EXERCISE WE NEED A FRAMEWORK TO LEARN HOW TO BE MORE MINDFUL THAT 'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT MEDITATION IS IT 'S FAMILIARIZING OURSELVES WITH THE PRESENT MOMENT BUT WE ALSO NEED TO KNOW HOW TO APPROACH IT IN THE RIGHT WAY TO GET THE BEST FROM IT
AndyPuddicombe_2012S AND THAT 'S WHAT THESE ARE FOR IN CASE YOU 'VE BEEN WONDERING BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ASSUME THAT MEDITATION IS ALL ABOUT STOPPING THOUGHTS GETTING RID OF EMOTIONS SOMEHOW CONTROLLING THE MIND BUT ACTUALLY IT 'S QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT IT 'S MORE ABOUT STEPPING BACK
AndyPuddicombe_2012S IF I FOCUS TOO MUCH ON THE BALLS THEN THERE 'S NO WAY THAT I CAN RELAX AND TALK TO YOU AT THE SAME TIME EQUALLY IF I RELAX TOO MUCH TALKING TO YOU THEN THERE 'S NO WAY I CAN FOCUS ON THE BALLS I 'M GOING TO DROP THEM NOW IN LIFE AND IN MEDITATION THERE 'LL BE TIMES WHEN THE FOCUS BECOMES A LITTLE BIT TOO INTENSE AND LIFE STARTS TO
AndyPuddicombe_2012S FEEL A BIT LIKE THIS IT 'S A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WAY TO LIVE LIFE WHEN YOU GET THIS TIGHT AND STRESSED
AndyPuddicombe_2012S WITHOUT ALL THE USUAL INVOLVEMENT NOW WHAT USUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE 'RE LEARNING TO BE MINDFUL IS THAT WE GET DISTRACTED
AndyPuddicombe_2012S YOU GO BACK TO IT REPEAT IT OH I AM WORRIED OH I REALLY AM WORRIED WOW THERE 'S SO MUCH ANXIETY AND BEFORE WE KNOW IT RIGHT WE 'RE ANXIOUS ABOUT FEELING ANXIOUS YOU KNOW THIS IS CRAZY WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME EVEN ON AN EVERYDAY LEVEL IF YOU THINK ABOUT
AndyPuddicombe_2012S THE LAST TIME I DUNNO YOU HAD A WOBBLY TOOTH YOU KNOW IT 'S WOBBLY AND YOU KNOW THAT IT HURTS BUT WHAT DO YOU DO EVERY TWENTY THIRTY SECONDS
AndyPuddicombe_2012S BUT WHEN YOU SIT DOWN AND YOU WATCH THE MIND IN THIS WAY YOU MIGHT SEE MANY DIFFERENT PATTERNS YOU MIGHT FIND A MIND THAT 'S REALLY RESTLESS AND THE WHOLE TIME
AndyPuddicombe_2012S THE OPPORTUNITY THE POTENTIAL TO STEP BACK AND TO GET A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE TO SEE THAT THINGS AREN 'T ALWAYS AS THEY APPEAR
AndyPuddicombe_2012S BUT WE CAN CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE EXPERIENCE IT THAT 'S THE POTENTIAL OF MEDITATION
