DonTapscott_2012G YESTERDAY 'S INTERNET WAS A PLATFORM FOR THE PRESENTATION OF CONTENT
DonTapscott_2012G THE INTERNET OF TODAY IS A PLATFORM FOR COMPUTATION THE INTERNET IS BECOMING A GIANT GLOBAL COMPUTER AND EVERY TIME YOU GO ON IT YOU UPLOAD A VIDEO YOU DO A GOOGLE SEARCH YOU REMIX SOMETHING YOU 'RE PROGRAMMING THIS BIG GLOBAL COMPUTER THAT WE ALL SHARE HUMANITY IS BUILDING A MACHINE
DonTapscott_2012G AND THIS ENABLES US TO COLLABORATE IN NEW WAYS COLLABORATION CAN OCCUR ON AN ASTRONOMICAL BASIS
DonTapscott_2012G NOW A NEW GENERATION IS OPENING UP THE WORLD AS WELL I STARTED STUDYING KIDS ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO SO ACTUALLY TWENTY YEARS AGO NOW AND I NOTICED HOW MY OWN CHILDREN WERE EFFORTLESSLY ABLE TO USE ALL THIS SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT MY CHILDREN ARE PRODIGIES
DonTapscott_2012G TO BE BATHED IN BITS I CALL THEM THE NET GENERATION I SAID THESE KIDS ARE DIFFERENT THEY HAVE NO FEAR OF TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE IT 'S NOT THERE IT 'S LIKE THE AIR IT 'S SORT OF LIKE I HAVE NO FEAR OF A REFRIGERATOR AND
DonTapscott_2012G THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS IS OPENING UP THE WORLD AS WELL OUR OPAQUE INSTITUTIONS FROM THE INDUSTRIAL AGE EVERYTHING FROM OLD MODELS OF THE CORPORATION GOVERNMENT MEDIA WALL STREET ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF BEING STALLED OR FROZEN OR IN ATROPHY OR EVEN FAILING
DonTapscott_2012G AND THIS IS NOW CREATING A BURNING PLATFORM IN THE WORLD I MEAN THINK ABOUT WALL STREET THE CORE MODUS OPERANDI OF WALL STREET ALMOST BROUGHT DOWN GLOBAL
DonTapscott_2012G CAPITALISM NOW YOU KNOW THE IDEA OF A BURNING PLATFORM THAT YOU 'RE SOMEWHERE WHERE THE COSTS OF STAYING WHERE YOU ARE BECOME GREATER THAN THE COSTS OF MOVING TO SOMETHING DIFFERENT PERHAPS SOMETHING RADICALLY
DonTapscott_2012G WHERE WE CAN FINALLY NOW REBUILD MANY OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE INDUSTRIAL AGE AROUND A NEW SET OF PRINCIPLES
DonTapscott_2012G NOW WHAT IS OPENNESS WELL AS IT TURNS OUT OPENNESS HAS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MEANINGS AND FOR EACH THERE 'S A CORRESPONDING PRINCIPLE FOR THE TRANSFORMATION OF CIVILIZATION THE FIRST IS COLLABORATION
DonTapscott_2012G NOW THIS IS OPENNESS IN THE SENSE OF THE BOUNDARIES OF ORGANIZATIONS BECOMING MORE POROUS AND FLUID AND OPEN
DonTapscott_2012G THE GUY IN THE PICTURE HERE I 'LL TELL YOU HIS STORY HIS NAME IS ROB MCEWEN I 'D LIKE TO SAY I HAVE THIS THINK TANK WE SCOUR THE WORLD FOR AMAZING CASE STUDIES THE REASON I KNOW THIS STORY IS BECAUSE HE 'S MY NEIGHBOR
DonTapscott_2012G AND HE TELLS ME THIS AMAZING STORY HE TAKES OVER THIS GOLD MINE AND HIS GEOLOGISTS CAN 'T TELL HIM WHERE THE GOLD IS HE GIVES THEM MORE MONEY FOR GEOLOGICAL DATA THEY COME BACK THEY CAN 'T TELL HIM WHERE TO GO INTO PRODUCTION
DonTapscott_2012G AFTER A FEW YEARS HE 'S SO FRUSTRATED HE 'S READY TO GIVE UP BUT HE HAS AN EPIPHANY ONE DAY HE WONDERS IF MY GEOLOGISTS DON 'T KNOW WHERE THE GOLD IS MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE DOES
DonTapscott_2012G SO HE DOES A RADICAL THING HE TAKES HIS GEOLOGICAL DATA HE PUBLISHES IT AND HE HOLDS A CONTEST ON THE INTERNET CALLED THE GOLDCORP CHALLENGE IT 'S BASICALLY HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN PRIZE MONEY FOR ANYBODY WHO CAN TELL ME DO I HAVE ANY GOLD AND IF SO WHERE
DonTapscott_2012G THE MARKET VALUE OF HIS COMPANY GOES FROM NINETY MILLION TO TEN BILLION DOLLARS AND I CAN TELL YOU BECAUSE HE 'S MY NEIGHBOR HE 'S A HAPPY CAMPER
DonTapscott_2012G YOU KNOW CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SAYS TALENT IS INSIDE RIGHT YOUR MOST PRECIOUS ASSET GOES OUT THE ELEVATOR EVERY NIGHT HE VIEWED TALENT DIFFERENTLY HE WONDERED WHO ARE THEIR PEERS HE SHOULD HAVE FIRED HIS GEOLOGY DEPARTMENT BUT HE DIDN 'T
DonTapscott_2012G YOU KNOW SOME OF THE BEST SUBMISSIONS DIDN 'T COME FROM GEOLOGISTS THEY CAME FROM COMPUTER SCIENTISTS ENGINEERS THE WINNER WAS A COMPUTER GRAPHICS COMPANY THAT BUILT A THREE DIMENSIONAL MODEL OF THE MINE WHERE YOU CAN HELICOPTER UNDERGROUND AND SEE WHERE THE GOLD IS
DonTapscott_2012G HE HELPED US UNDERSTAND THAT SOCIAL MEDIA 'S BECOMING SOCIAL PRODUCTION IT 'S NOT ABOUT HOOKING UP ONLINE THIS IS A NEW MEANS OF PRODUCTION IN THE MAKING AND THIS IDEAGORA THAT HE CREATED AN OPEN MARKET AGORA FOR UNIQUELY QUALIFIED MINDS
DonTapscott_2012G WAS PART OF A CHANGE A PROFOUND CHANGE IN THE DEEP STRUCTURE AND ARCHITECTURE OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS AND HOW WE SORT OF ORCHESTRATE CAPABILITY TO INNOVATE TO CREATE GOODS AND SERVICES TO ENGAGE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT HOW WE CREATE PUBLIC VALUE
DonTapscott_2012G OPENNESS IS ABOUT COLLABORATION NOW SECONDLY OPENNESS IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY THIS IS DIFFERENT HERE WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT THE COMMUNICATION OF PERTINENT INFORMATION TO STAKEHOLDERS OF ORGANIZATIONS EMPLOYEES CUSTOMERS BUSINESS PARTNERS SHAREHOLDERS AND SO ON
DonTapscott_2012G AND EVERYWHERE OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE BECOMING NAKED PEOPLE ARE ALL BENT OUT OF SHAPE ABOUT WIKILEAKS BUT THAT 'S JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG YOU SEE PEOPLE AT THEIR FINGERTIPS NOW EVERYBODY
DonTapscott_2012G SO THIS IS GOOD IT 'S NOT
DonTapscott_2012G THEY HAD A TECHNOLOGY DISRUPTION AND RATHER THAN TAKING A BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION TO CORRESPOND TO THAT
DonTapscott_2012G THEY TOOK AND SOUGHT A LEGAL SOLUTION AND THE INDUSTRY THAT BROUGHT YOU ELVIS AND THE BEATLES IS NOW SUING CHILDREN AND IS IN DANGER OF COLLAPSE SO WE NEED TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY I 'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
DonTapscott_2012G WE NEED TO REINVENT THE WHOLE MODEL OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY NEEDS TO PLACE ASSETS IN A COMMONS THEY NEED TO START SHARING PRECOMPETITIVE RESEARCH THEY NEED TO START SHARING CLINICAL TRIAL DATA AND IN DOING SO CREATE
DonTapscott_2012G A RISING TIDE THAT COULD LIFT ALL BOATS NOT JUST
DonTapscott_2012G FOR THE INDUSTRY BUT FOR HUMANITY
DonTapscott_2012G NOW THE FOURTH MEANING OF OPENNESS AND CORRESPONDING PRINCIPLE IS ABOUT
DonTapscott_2012G SOCIAL MEDIA DIDN 'T CREATE THE REVOLUTION IT WAS CREATED BY A NEW GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANTED JOBS AND HOPE AND WHO DIDN 'T WANT TO BE TREATED AS SUBJECTS ANYMORE
DonTapscott_2012G BUT JUST AS THE INTERNET DROPS TRANSACTION AND COLLABORATION COSTS IN BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT
DonTapscott_2012G IT ALSO DROPS THE COST OF DISSENT OF REBELLION AND EVEN INSURRECTION IN WAYS THAT PEOPLE DIDN 'T UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW DURING THE TUNISIAN REVOLUTION SNIPERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REGIME WERE KILLING UNARMED STUDENTS IN THE STREET SO THE STUDENTS WOULD TAKE THEIR
DonTapscott_2012G MOBILE DEVICES TAKE A PICTURE TRIANGULATE THE LOCATION SEND THAT PICTURE TO FRIENDLY MILITARY UNITS WHO 'D COME IN AND TAKE OUT THE SNIPERS
DonTapscott_2012G YOU THINK THAT SOCIAL MEDIA IS ABOUT HOOKING UP ONLINE
DonTapscott_2012G FOR THESE KIDS IT WAS A MILITARY TOOL TO DEFEND UNARMED PEOPLE FROM MURDERERS IT WAS A TOOL OF SELF DEFENSE YOU KNOW AS WE SPEAK TODAY
DonTapscott_2012G YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BEING KILLED IN SYRIA AND UP UNTIL THREE MONTHS AGO IF YOU WERE INJURED ON THE STREET AN AMBULANCE WOULD PICK YOU UP TAKE YOU TO THE HOSPITAL YOU 'D GO IN SAY WITH A BROKEN LEG AND YOU 'D COME OUT WITH A BULLET IN YOUR HEAD
DonTapscott_2012G SO THESE TWENTY SOMETHINGS CREATED AN ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WHERE WHAT THEY DID IS THEY USED TWITTER AND BASIC
DonTapscott_2012G PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TOOLS THAT WHEN SOMEONE 'S INJURED A CAR WOULD SHOW UP IT WOULD PICK THEM UP TAKE THEM TO A MAKESHIFT MEDICAL CLINIC WHERE YOU 'D GET MEDICAL TREATMENT AS OPPOSED TO BEING EXECUTED SO THIS IS A TIME OF GREAT CHANGE NOW IT 'S NOT WITHOUT ITS PROBLEMS UP UNTIL
DonTapscott_2012G TWO YEARS AGO ALL REVOLUTIONS IN HUMAN HISTORY HAD A LEADERSHIP AND WHEN THE OLD REGIME FELL THE
DonTapscott_2012G THE LEADERSHIP AND THE ORGANIZATION WOULD TAKE POWER WELL THESE WIKI REVOLUTIONS HAPPEN SO FAST THEY CREATE A VACUUM AND POLITICS ABHORS A VACUUM AND UNSAVORY FORCES CAN FILL THAT
DonTapscott_2012G TYPICALLY THE OLD REGIME OR
DonTapscott_2012G EXTREMISTS OR FUNDAMENTALIST FORCES YOU CAN SEE THIS PLAYING OUT TODAY IN EGYPT BUT THAT DOESN 'T MATTER BECAUSE THIS IS MOVING FORWARD THE TRAIN HAS LEFT THE STATION THE CAT IS OUT OF THE BAG THE HORSE IS OUT OF THE BARN HELP ME OUT HERE OKAY LAUGHTER THE TOOTHPASTE IS OUT OF THE TUBE I MEAN WE 'RE NOT PUTTING THIS ONE BACK
DonTapscott_2012G THE OPEN WORLD IS BRINGING EMPOWERMENT
DonTapscott_2012G AND FREEDOM I THINK AT THE END OF THESE FOUR DAYS THAT YOU 'LL COME TO CONCLUDE THAT THE ARC OF HISTORY IS A POSITIVE ONE
DonTapscott_2012G AND IT 'S TOWARDS OPENNESS IF YOU GO BACK A FEW HUNDRED YEARS ALL AROUND THE WORLD IT WAS A VERY CLOSED SOCIETY IT WAS AGRARIAN AND THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION AND POLITICAL SYSTEM WAS CALLED FEUDALISM AND KNOWLEDGE WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE CHURCH AND THE NOBILITY PEOPLE DIDN 'T KNOW ABOUT THINGS THERE WAS NO
DonTapscott_2012G CONCEPT OF PROGRESS YOU WERE BORN YOU LIVED YOUR LIFE AND YOU DIED BUT THEN JOHANNES GUTENBERG CAME ALONG WITH HIS GREAT INVENTION AND OVER TIME
DonTapscott_2012G THE SOCIETY OPENED UP PEOPLE STARTED TO LEARN ABOUT THINGS AND WHEN THEY DID THE INSTITUTIONS OF FEUDAL SOCIETY APPEARED TO BE STALLED OR FROZEN OR FAILING IT DIDN 'T MAKE SENSE FOR THE CHURCH TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MEDICINE WHEN PEOPLE HAD KNOWLEDGE SO WE SAW THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION MARTIN LUTHER CALLED THE PRINTING PRESS GOD 'S HIGHEST
DonTapscott_2012G PROMISE AN AGE OF COLLABORATION
DonTapscott_2012G WHERE THE BOUNDARIES OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS ARE CHANGING OF TRANSPARENCY WHERE SUNLIGHT IS DISINFECTING CIVILIZATION AN AGE OF SHARING AND UNDERSTANDING THE NEW POWER OF THE COMMONS AND IT 'S AN AGE OF EMPOWERMENT AND OF FREEDOM
DonTapscott_2012G BEES COME IN SWARMS AND FISH COME IN SCHOOLS
DonTapscott_2012G STARLINGS IN THE AREA AROUND
DonTapscott_2012G AND THE MURMURATION REFERS TO THE MURMURING OF THE WINGS OF THE BIRDS AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY THE STARLINGS ARE OUT OVER A TWENTY MILE RADIUS SORT OF DOING THEIR STARLING THING
DonTapscott_2012G AND AT NIGHT THEY COME TOGETHER AND THEY CREATE ONE OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR THINGS IN ALL OF NATURE AND IT 'S CALLED A MURMURATION
DonTapscott_2012G AND SCIENTISTS THAT HAVE STUDIED THIS HAVE SAID THEY 'VE NEVER SEEN AN ACCIDENT NOW THIS THING HAS A FUNCTION
DonTapscott_2012G IT PROTECTS THE BIRDS YOU CAN SEE ON THE RIGHT HERE THERE 'S A PREDATOR BEING CHASED AWAY BY THE COLLECTIVE POWER
DonTapscott_2012G IF YOU 'RE A PREDATOR OF STARLINGS
DonTapscott_2012G IT 'S AN OPENNESS IT 'S A SHARING OF ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION NOT JUST ABOUT LOCATION AND TRAJECTORY AND DANGER AND SO ON BUT ABOUT FOOD SOURCES
DonTapscott_2012G PERHAPS LIKE WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND
DonTapscott_2012G SPRING AND YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT 'S UNDERWAY
DonTapscott_2012G A VAST NETWORK OF AIR AND GLASS
DonTapscott_2012G COULD WE GO BEYOND JUST SHARING INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE COULD WE START TO SHARE OUR INTELLIGENCE
DonTapscott_2012G COULD WE CREATE SOME KIND OF COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE THAT GOES BEYOND AN INDIVIDUAL OR A GROUP OR A TEAM TO CREATE
DonTapscott_2012G LET 'S DO THIS
