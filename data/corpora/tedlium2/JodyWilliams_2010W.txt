JodyWilliams_2010W OF GETTING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO PLANT THOSE TREES TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO OVERCOME THE AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENT IN HER COUNTRY
JodyWilliams_2010W PEOPLE COULD NOT GATHER WITHOUT GETTING BUSTED AND TAKEN TO JAIL BUT IF THEY WERE TOGETHER PLANTING
JodyWilliams_2010W TREES FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
JodyWilliams_2010W IT WAS OKAY CREATIVITY
JodyWilliams_2010W BUT IT'S NOT JUST ICONIC WOMEN

JodyWilliams_2010W ABOUT VOTING IT'S ABOUT BEING AN ACTIVE CITIZEN
JodyWilliams_2010W THAT'S WHAT I GOT STUCK DOING THE LANDMINE CAMPAIGN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MADE THIS CAMPAIGN WORK IS BECAUSE WE GREW FROM TWO NGO 'S
