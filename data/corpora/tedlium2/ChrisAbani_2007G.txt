ChrisAbani_2007G@100.66:109.01 BUT THEN I THOUGHT BUT WHY BE RUDE TO CHIMPANZEES I GUESS THERE GOES MY GREEN CARD
ChrisAbani_2007G@118.36:126.50 ABOUT NEWS STORIES ABOUT AFRICA WE'RE NOT REALLY TALKING ABOUT AFRICAN NARRATIVES AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE A DISTINCTION BECAUSE IF THE NEWS IS ANYTHING TO GO BY
ChrisAbani_2007G@127.31:137.71 FORTY PERCENT OF AMERICANS CAN'T EITHER CAN'T AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE OR HAVE THE MOST INADEQUATE HEALTH INSURANCE AND HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO DESPITE
ChrisAbani_2007G@138.43:150.63 THE PROTEST OF MILLIONS OF HIS CITIZENS EVEN HIS OWN CONGRESS CONTINUES TO PROSECUTE A SENSELESS WAR SO IF NEWS IS ANYTHING TO GO BY THE US IS RIGHT THERE WITH ZIMBABWE RIGHT WHICH

ChrisAbani_2007G@180.14:189.36 THINK WELL I REALLY KNOW WHO I AM NOW BECAUSE THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SAYS THAT THE STOCK EXCHANGE CLOSED AT THIS MANY POINTS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HOW TO BE WHO WE ARE
ChrisAbani_2007G@200.66:214.50 TO REMEMBER BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN AFRICA THE COMPLICATED QUESTIONS WE WANT TO ASK ABOUT WHAT ALL OF THIS MEANS HAS BEEN ASKED FROM THE ROCK PAINTINGS OF THE SAN PEOPLE
ChrisAbani_2007G@214.94:229.09 THROUGH THE SUNDIATA EPICS OF MALI TO MODERN CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT AFRICA READ OUR LITERATURE AND NOT JUST THINGS FALL APART BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE LIKE SAYING I 'VE READ GONE WITH THE WIND AND SO I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT AMERICA
ChrisAbani_2007G@230.51:237.28 VERY IMPORTANT THERE'S A POEM BY JACK GILBERT CALLED THE FORGOTTEN DIALECT OF THE HEART HE SAYS
ChrisAbani_2007G@237.97:244.85 WHEN THE SUMERIAN TABLETS WERE FIRST TRANSLATED THEY WERE THOUGHT TO BE BUSINESS RECORDS BUT WHAT IF THEY WERE POEMS AND

ChrisAbani_2007G@262.56:270.16 THIS IS IMPORTANT IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE MISREADING IS REALLY THE CHANCE FOR COMPLICATION AND OPPORTUNITY THE FIRST IGBO BIBLE
ChrisAbani_2007G@270.48:277.73 WAS TRANSLATED FROM ENGLISH IN ABOUT THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS BY BISHOP CROWTHER WHO WAS A YORUBA AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW IGBO IS A TONAL LANGUAGE
ChrisAbani_2007G@278.58:287.42 AND SO THEY'LL SAY THE WORD IGWE AND IGWE SAME SPELLING ONE MEANS SKY OR HEAVEN AND ONE MEANS BICYCLE
ChrisAbani_2007G@289.54:293.84 SO GOD IS IN HEAVEN SURROUNDED BY HIS ANGELS WAS
ChrisAbani_2007G@315.58:319.05 THIS IS GOOD BECAUSE LANGUAGE COMPLICATES THINGS
ChrisAbani_2007G@320.35:329.95 YOU KNOW WE OFTEN THINK THAT LANGUAGE MIRRORS THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE AND I FIND THAT'S NOT TRUE THE LANGUAGE ACTUALLY MAKES THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE
ChrisAbani_2007G@342.63:349.45 EVERYTHING ALL OF THIS IS STORY AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE IF WE DON 'T THEN WE BECOME
ChrisAbani_2007G@376.95:384.34 TO REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE OTHERWISE TEN YEARS FROM NOW WE'LL BE BACK HERE TRYING TO TELL THIS STORY AGAIN SO
ChrisAbani_2007G@385.85:391.99 WHAT IT SAYS TO ME THEN IS THAT IT'S NOT REALLY THE PROBLEM ISN'T REALLY THE STORIES THAT ARE BEING TOLD OR WHICH STORIES ARE BEING TOLD
ChrisAbani_2007G@392.36:399.98 THE PROBLEM REALLY IS THE TERMS OF HUMANITY THAT WE'RE WILLING TO BRING TO COMPLICATE EVERY STORY AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
ChrisAbani_2007G@402.02:405.67 A NIGERIAN JOKE WELL IT'S JUST A JOKE ANYWAY
ChrisAbani_2007G@406.00:419.98 SO THERE'S TOM DICK AND HARRY AND THEY'RE WORKING CONSTRUCTION AND TOM OPENS UP HIS LUNCH BOX AND THERE'S RICE IN IT AND HE GOES ON THIS RANT ABOUT TWENTY YEARS MY WIFE HAS BEEN PACKING RICE FOR LUNCH IF SHE GOES IT AGAIN TOMORROW I'M GONNA THROW MYSELF OFF THIS BUILDING AND KILL MYSELF

ChrisAbani_2007G@443.40:452.36 THIS SEEMINGLY INNOCENT JOKE WHEN I HEARD IT AS A CHILD IN NIGERIA WAS TOLD ABOUT IGBO YORUBA AND HAUSA WITH THE HAUSA BEING HARRY
ChrisAbani_2007G@452.60:460.01 SO WHAT SEEMS LIKE AN ECCENTRIC IF TRAGIC JOKE ABOUT HARRY BECOMES A WAY TO SPREAD ETHNIC HATRED
ChrisAbani_2007G@460.11:470.59 MY FATHER WAS EDUCATED IN CORK IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CORK IN THE FIFTIES IN FACT EVERY TIME I READ IN IRELAND PEOPLE GET ME ALL MISTAKEN AND THEY SAY OH THIS IS CHRIS O 'BARNEY FROM CORK

ChrisAbani_2007G@482.01:483.28 BECAUSE THEY WILL POISON YOU
ChrisAbani_2007G@484.99:489.27 IT MAKES SENSE NOW WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE IF YOU'D KNOWN MY FATHER YOU WOULD 'VE WANTED TO POISON HIM
ChrisAbani_2007G@499.63:503.10 THE BEGINNING OF THE BIAFRAN NIGERIAN CIVIL WAR AND
ChrisAbani_2007G@504.37:513.69 THE WAR ENDED AFTER THREE YEARS AND I WAS GROWING UP IN SCHOOL AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DIDN'T WANT US TAUGHT ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE WAR BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT PROBABLY WOULD MAKE US

ChrisAbani_2007G@539.90:547.28 TEACHING JEWISH HOLOCAUST HISTORY TO YOUNG IGBO CHILDREN STORY IS POWERFUL STORY IS FLUID AND IT BELONGS TO NOBODY
ChrisAbani_2007G@547.70:555.98 AND IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT MY FIRST NOVEL AT SIXTEEN WAS ABOUT NEO NAZIS TAKING OVER NIGERIA TO INSTITUTE THE FOURTH REICH MAKES PERFECT SENSE
ChrisAbani_2007G@558.86:567.03 TO BLOW UP STRATEGIC TARGETS AND TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY AND THEY WERE FOILED BY A NIGERIAN JAMES BOND CALLED COYOTE WILLIAMS AND A JEWISH
ChrisAbani_2007G@577.05:588.05 BUT ALSO THE BOOK WAS LAUNCHED IN TIME FOR ME TO BE ACCUSED OF CONSTRUCTING THE BLUEPRINT FOR A FOILED COUP ATTEMPT SO AT EIGHTEEN I WAS BONDED OFF TO PRISON IN NIGERIA
ChrisAbani_2007G@589.01:598.70 I GREW UP VERY PRIVILEGED AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT PRIVILEGE BECAUSE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT HERE A LOT OF US ARE VERY PRIVILEGED I GREW UP SERVANTS CARS TELEVISIONS ALL THAT STUFF
ChrisAbani_2007G@599.36:609.32 MY STORY OF NIGERIA GROWING UP WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE STORY I ENCOUNTERED IN PRISON AND I HAD NO LANGUAGE FOR IT I WAS COMPLETELY TERRIFIED COMPLETELY BROKEN
ChrisAbani_2007G@610.15:610.42 AND
ChrisAbani_2007G@612.46:625.61 KEPT TRYING TO FIND A NEW LANGUAGE A NEW WAY TO MAKE SENSE OF ALL OF THIS SIX MONTHS AFTER THAT WITH NO EXPLANATION THEY LET ME GO NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE SEEN ME AT THE BUFFET TABLES KNOW THAT IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS COSTING THEM TOO MUCH TO FEED
ChrisAbani_2007G@635.41:644.55 BUT I MEAN I GREW UP WITH THIS INCREDIBLE PRIVILEGE AND NOT JUST ME MILLIONS OF NIGERIANS GREW UP WITH BOOKS AND LIBRARIES IN FACT WE WERE TALKING LAST NIGHT ABOUT HOW
ChrisAbani_2007G@645.09:653.40 ALL OF THE STEAMY NOVELS OF HAROLD ROBBINS HAD DONE MORE FOR SEX EDUCATION OF HORNY TEENAGE BOYS IN AFRICA THAN ANY SEX EDUCATION PROGRAMS EVER
ChrisAbani_2007G@655.11:662.71 ALL OF THOSE ARE GONE WE ARE SQUANDERING THE MOST VALUABLE RESOURCE WE HAVE ON THIS CONTINENT THE VALUABLE RESOURCE OF THE IMAGINATION
ChrisAbani_2007G@663.45:673.99 IN THE FILM SOMETIMES IN APRIL BY RAOUL PECK IDRIS ELBA IS POISED IN A SCENE WITH HIS MACHETE RAISED AND HE 'S BEING FORCED BY A CROWD TO CHOP UP HIS BEST FRIEND
ChrisAbani_2007G@694.23:701.19 CHOP HIM UP SHUT HIM UP AND AS IDRIS MOVES FRASER SCREAMS STOP
ChrisAbani_2007G@710.96:718.16 IT'S NOT THE LOOK OF HORROR AND TERROR ON FRASER 'S FACE THAT STOPS IDRIS OR US IT'S THE
ChrisAbani_2007G@719.68:729.00 IT'S ONE THAT SAYS DON 'T DO THIS AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS TO SAVE MYSELF ALTHOUGH THIS WOULD BE NICE I'M DOING IT TO SAVE YOU
ChrisAbani_2007G@729.34:731.81 BECAUSE IF YOU DO THIS YOU WILL BE LOST
ChrisAbani_2007G@733.59:743.22 TO BE SO AFRAID THAT YOU'RE STANDING IN THE FACE OF A DEATH YOU CAN'T ESCAPE AND THAT YOU'RE SOILING YOURSELF AND CRYING BUT TO SAY IN THAT MOMENT AS FRASER SAYS TO IDRIS TELL MY GIRLFRIEND I LOVE

ChrisAbani_2007G@748.49:756.72 I AM LOST ALREADY BUT NOT YOU NOT YOU THIS IS A REDEMPTION WE CAN ALL ASPIRE TO
ChrisAbani_2007G@766.88:773.20 AS A WRITER I FIND THAT AFRICAN WRITERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE CURATORS OF OUR HUMANITY ON THIS CONTINENT
ChrisAbani_2007G@773.64:780.82 THE QUESTION IS HOW DO I BALANCE NARRATIVES THAT ARE WONDERFUL WITH NARRATIVES
ChrisAbani_2007G@781.85:794.82 OF WOUNDS AND SELF LOATHING AND THIS IS THE DIFFICULTY THAT I FACE I AM TRYING TO MOVE BEYOND POLITICAL RHETORIC TO A PLACE OF ETHICAL QUESTIONING I AM ASKING US TO BALANCE THE IDEA OF OUR COMPLETE VULNERABILITY
ChrisAbani_2007G@795.35:808.99 WITH THE COMPLETE NOTION OF TRANSFORMATION OR WHAT IS POSSIBLE AS A YOUNG MIDDLE CLASS NIGERIAN ACTIVIST I LAUNCHED MYSELF ALONG WITH A WHOLE GENERATION OF US INTO THE CAMPAIGN TO STOP THE GOVERNMENT AND I ASKED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
ChrisAbani_2007G@809.49:822.25 WITHOUT QUESTIONING MY RIGHT TO DO SO TO GO UP AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND I WATCHED THEM BEING LOCKED UP IN PRISON AND TEAR GASSED I JUSTIFIED IT AND I SAID THIS IS THE COST OF REVOLUTION HAVE I NOT MYSELF BEEN IMPRISONED HAVE I NOT MYSELF BEEN BEATEN

ChrisAbani_2007G@892.83:894.97 I WANT TO BELIEVE

ChrisAbani_2007G@905.16:917.54 NOT BECAUSE I WAS ENCOUNTERING HOMOSEXUAL SEX AND LOVE FOR THE FIRST TIME BUT BECAUSE THE WAY JAMES WROTE ABOUT IT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO ATTACH OTHERNESS TO IT HERE JIMMY SAID HERE IS LOVE ALL OF IT
ChrisAbani_2007G@918.28:927.18 THE FACT THAT IT HAPPENS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY TAKES YOU QUITE BY SURPRISE MY FRIEND RONALD GOTTESMAN SAYS THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THOSE WHO CAN COUNT AND THOSE
