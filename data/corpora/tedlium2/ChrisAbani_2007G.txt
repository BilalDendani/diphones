ChrisAbani_2007G TO REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE OTHERWISE TEN YEARS FROM NOW WE'LL BE BACK HERE TRYING TO TELL THIS STORY AGAIN SO
ChrisAbani_2007G WHAT IT SAYS TO ME THEN IS THAT IT'S NOT REALLY THE PROBLEM ISN'T REALLY THE STORIES THAT ARE BEING TOLD OR WHICH STORIES ARE BEING TOLD

ChrisAbani_2007G AS A WRITER I FIND THAT AFRICAN WRITERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE CURATORS OF OUR HUMANITY ON THIS CONTINENT

ChrisAbani_2007G OF WOUNDS AND SELF LOATHING AND THIS IS THE DIFFICULTY THAT I FACE I AM TRYING TO MOVE BEYOND POLITICAL RHETORIC TO A PLACE OF ETHICAL QUESTIONING I AM ASKING US TO BALANCE THE IDEA OF OUR COMPLETE VULNERABILITY
