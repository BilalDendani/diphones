SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 GOOD MORNING
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 LET 'S LOOK FOR A MINUTE AT THE GREATEST ICON OF ALL
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH HIS FANTASTIC WORK HIS DRAWINGS HIS PAINTINGS HIS INVENTIONS HIS WRITINGS
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 BUT WE DO NOT KNOW HIS FACE
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 THOUSANDS OF BOOKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT HIM BUT THERE'S CONTROVERSY AND IT REMAINS ABOUT HIS LOOKS
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 EVEN THIS WELL KNOWN PORTRAIT IS NOT ACCEPTED BY MANY ART HISTORIANS SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 IS THIS THE FACE OF LEONARDO DA VINCI OR ISN'T IT
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE HIS CONTEMPORARIES MADE FACES LIKE THE ONES YOU SEE HERE EN FACE OR THREE QUARTERS
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 SO SURELY A PASSIONATE DRAWER LIKE LEONARDO MUST HAVE MADE SELF PORTRAITS FROM TIME TO TIME
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 SO LET 'S TRY TO FIND THEM I THINK THAT IF WE WERE TO SCAN ALL OF HIS WORK
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 AND LOOK FOR SELF PORTRAITS WE WOULD FIND HIS FACE LOOKING AT US
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 SO I LOOKED AT ALL OF HIS DRAWINGS MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 AND LOOKED FOR MALE PORTRAITS THERE ARE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY YOU SEE THEM HERE
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 WHICH ONES OF THESE COULD BE SELF PORTRAITS WELL FOR THAT THEY HAVE TO BE DONE AS WE JUST SAW EN FACE OR THREE QUARTERS SO WE CAN ELIMINATE ALL THE PROFILES
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 IT ALSO HAS TO BE SUFFICIENTLY DETAILED
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 SO WE CAN ALSO ELIMINATE THE ONES THAT ARE VERY VAGUE OR VERY STYLIZED
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 AND WE KNOW FROM HIS CONTEMPORARIES THAT LEONARDO WAS A VERY HANDSOME EVEN BEAUTIFUL MAN SO WE CAN ALSO ELIMINATE THE UGLY ONES OR THE
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENS ONLY THREE CANDIDATES REMAIN THAT FIT THE BILL
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 YES INDEED THE OLD MAN IS THERE
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 AS IS THIS FAMOUS PEN DRAWING OF THE HOMO VITRUVIANOS
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 AND LASTLY THE ONLY PORTRAIT OF A MALE THAT LEONARDO PAINTED THE MUSICIAN
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 WE GO INTO THESE FACES I SHOULD EXPLAIN WHY I HAVE SOME RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT THEM
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 I'VE MADE MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED PORTRAITS MYSELF FOR NEWSPAPERS OVER THE COURSE OF THREE HUNDRED THIRTY YEARS SORRY THIRTY YEARS
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 THEY HAVE THE SAME BROAD FOREHEAD THE HORIZONTAL EYEBROWS THE LONG NOSE THE CURVED LIPS AND THE SMALL WELL DEVELOPED CHIN I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT THERE IS NO REASON WHY THESE PORTRAITS SHOULD LOOK ALIKE
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 ALL WE DID WAS LOOK FOR PORTRAITS THAT HAD THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A SELF PORTRAIT AND LOOK THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR NOW
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 MADE IN THE RIGHT ORDER THE YOUNG MAN SHOULD BE MADE FIRST AND AS YOU SEE HERE FROM THE YEARS THAT THEY WERE CREATED IT IS INDEED THE CASE THEY ARE MADE IN THE RIGHT ORDER
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 WHAT WAS THE AGE OF LEONARDO AT THE TIME DOES THAT FIT YES IT DOES HE WAS THIRTY THREE THIRTY EIGHT AND SIXTY THREE WHEN THESE WERE MADE SO WE HAVE THREE PICTURES POTENTIALLY OF THE SAME PERSON OF THE SAME AGE AS LEONARDO AT THE TIME
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 BUT HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S HIM AND NOT SOMEONE ELSE
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 WELL WE NEED A REFERENCE AND HERE 'S THE ONLY PICTURE OF LEONARDO THAT'S WIDELY ACCEPTED IT'S A STATUE MADE BY VERROCCHIO OF DAVID FOR WHICH LEONARDO POSED AS A BOY OF FIFTEEN AND IF WE NOW COMPARE THE FACE OF THE STATUE
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 WITH THE FACE OF THE MUSICIAN
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 YOU SEE THE VERY SAME FEATURES AGAIN THE STATUE IS THE REFERENCE AND IT CONNECTS THE IDENTITY OF LEONARDO TO THOSE THREE FACES
