JamesBalog_2009G MOST OF THE
JamesBalog_2009G TIME ART AND SCIENCE STARE AT EACH OTHER ACROSS A GULF OF MUTUAL INCOMPREHENSION
JamesBalog_2009G GREAT CONFUSION WHEN THE TWO LOOK AT EACH OTHER ART OF COURSE LOOKS AT THE WORLD THROUGH
JamesBalog_2009G THE PSYCHE THE EMOTIONS EVEN THE UNCONSCIOUS AT TIMES AND OF COURSE THE AESTHETIC SCIENCE TENDS TO LOOK AT THE WORLD THROUGH THE RATIONAL THE QUANTITATIVE THINGS THAT CAN BE MEASURED AND DESCRIBED
JamesBalog_2009G BUT IT GIVES ART A TERRIFIC CONTEXT FOR UNDERSTANDING IN THE EXTREME ICE SURVEY WE'RE DEDICATED TO BRINGING THOSE TWO
JamesBalog_2009G PARTS OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING TOGETHER MERGING ART AND SCIENCE TO THE END OF HELPING US UNDERSTAND NATURE AND HUMANITY 'S RELATIONSHIP WITH NATURE BETTER
JamesBalog_2009G FIRMLY OF THE BELIEF THAT PHOTOGRAPHY VIDEO AND FILM HAVE TREMENDOUS POWER TO HELP US UNDERSTAND AND SHAPE
JamesBalog_2009G THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT NATURE AND ABOUT OURSELVES IN RELATIONSHIP TO NATURE IN THIS PROJECT WE'RE SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED OF COURSE IN ICE
JamesBalog_2009G I'M FASCINATED BY THE BEAUTY OF IT THE MUTABILITY OF IT THE MALLEABILITY OF IT AND THE FABULOUS SHAPES IN WHICH IT CAN
JamesBalog_2009G IT'S THE PLACE WHERE WE CAN SEE AND TOUCH AND HEAR AND FEEL CLIMATE CHANGE IN ACTION CLIMATE CHANGE IS A REALLY ABSTRACT THING
JamesBalog_2009G VERY VISIBLE THEY'RE PHOTOGRAPHABLE THEY'RE MEASURABLE NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE GLACIERS IN THE WORLD ARE RETREATING OR SHRINKING
JamesBalog_2009G IT'S BOMB PROOF INFORMATION AND THE GREAT IRONY AND TRAGEDY OF OUR TIME IS THAT A LOT OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC THINKS THAT SCIENCE IS STILL ARGUING ABOUT THAT SCIENCE IS NOT ARGUING ABOUT THAT
JamesBalog_2009G THESE IMAGES WE SEE ICE FROM ENORMOUS GLACIERS ICE SHEETS THAT ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLD BREAKING UP INTO CHUNKS AND CHUNK BY CHUNK BY CHUNK
JamesBalog_2009G ICEBERG BY ICEBERG TURNING INTO GLOBAL SEA LEVEL RISE SO HAVING SEEN ALL THIS IN THE COURSE OF A THIRTY YEAR CAREER I WAS STILL A SKEPTIC ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE UNTIL ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO BECAUSE I THOUGHT
JamesBalog_2009G THE STORY OF CLIMATE CHANGE WAS BASED ON COMPUTER MODELS I HADN'T REALIZED IT WAS BASED ON CONCRETE MEASUREMENTS
JamesBalog_2009G OF WHAT THE PALEO CLIMATES THE ANCIENT CLIMATES WERE AS RECORDED IN THE ICE SHEETS AS RECORDED IN DEEP OCEAN SEDIMENTS AS RECORDED IN LAKE SEDIMENTS TREE RINGS AND A LOT OF OTHER
JamesBalog_2009G WAYS OF MEASURING TEMPERATURE WHEN I REALIZED THAT CLIMATE CHANGE WAS REAL AND IT WAS NOT BASED ON COMPUTER MODELS
JamesBalog_2009G I DECIDED THAT ONE DAY I WOULD DO A PROJECT LOOKING AT TRYING TO
JamesBalog_2009G IN TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY THAT I SHOULD STATION A CAMERA OR TWO AT A GLACIER AND LET IT SHOOT EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES OR EVERY HOUR OR WHATEVER AND WATCH THE PROGRESSION OF THE LANDSCAPE OVER TIME WELL WITHIN ABOUT THREE
JamesBalog_2009G WEEKS I INCAUTIOUSLY TURNED THAT IDEA OF A COUPLE OF TIME LAPSE CAMERAS INTO TWENTY FIVE TIME LAPSE CAMERAS AND THE NEXT SIX MONTHS OF MY LIFE WERE THE HARDEST
JamesBalog_2009G TIME IN MY CAREER TRYING TO DESIGN BUILD AND DEPLOY OUT IN THE FIELD THESE TWENTY FIVE TIME LAPSE CAMERAS THEY ARE
JamesBalog_2009G SOLAR PANELS POWER THEM POWER GOES INTO A BATTERY THERE IS A CUSTOM MADE COMPUTER THAT TELLS THE CAMERA WHEN TO FIRE
JamesBalog_2009G CAMERAS OUT ON THE GREENLAND ICE SHEET WE ACTUALLY DRILLED HOLES INTO THE ICE WAY DEEP DOWN BELOW THE THAWING LEVEL AND LEFT THE CAMERAS OUT THERE FOR THE PAST MONTH AND A HALF OR SO ACTUALLY THERE'S STILL A CAMERA OUT THERE RIGHT NOW
JamesBalog_2009G IN ANY CASE THE CAMERAS SHOOT ROUGHLY EVERY HOUR EVERY HALF HOUR EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES EVERY FIVE MINUTES HERE 'S A TIME LAPSE OF ONE OF THE TIME LAPSE UNITS BEING MADE
JamesBalog_2009G I PERSONALLY OBSESSED ABOUT EVERY NUT BOLT AND WASHER IN THESE CRAZY THINGS I SPENT HALF MY LIFE AT OUR LOCAL HARDWARE STORE DURING THE MONTHS WHEN WE BUILT THESE UNITS ORIGINALLY
JamesBalog_2009G WE'RE WORKING IN MOST OF THE MAJOR GLACIATED REGIONS OF THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE OUR TIME LAPSE UNITS ARE IN ALASKA
JamesBalog_2009G THE ROCKIES GREENLAND AND ICELAND AND WE HAVE REPEAT PHOTOGRAPHY POSITIONS THAT IS PLACES WE JUST VISIT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IN BRITISH COLUMBIA THE ALPS AND BOLIVIA
JamesBalog_2009G HOUR AGO ALL ACROSS THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE WATCHING WHAT'S HAPPENED AND WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE FIELD IT'S BEEN A FANTASTIC AMOUNT OF WORK WE'VE BEEN OUT FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND WE'VE GOT ABOUT ANOTHER TWO AND A HALF YEARS YET TO GO
JamesBalog_2009G THAT'S ONLY HALF OUR JOB THE OTHER HALF OF OUR JOB IS TO TELL THE STORY TO THE GLOBAL PUBLIC
JamesBalog_2009G YOU KNOW SCIENTISTS HAVE COLLECTED THIS KIND OF INFORMATION OFF AND ON OVER THE YEARS BUT A LOT OF IT STAYS WITHIN THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY SIMILARLY
JamesBalog_2009G A LOT OF ART PROJECTS STAY IN THE ART COMMUNITY AND I FEEL VERY MUCH A RESPONSIBILITY THROUGH MECHANISMS LIKE TED
JamesBalog_2009G AND LIKE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE WITH THE SENATE WITH JOHN KERRY 'S OFFICE TO INFLUENCE POLICY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITH THESE PICTURES AS WELL WE'VE DONE FILMS WE'VE DONE BOOKS WE HAVE MORE COMING
JamesBalog_2009G WE HAVE A SITE ON GOOGLE EARTH THAT GOOGLE EARTH WAS GENEROUS ENOUGH TO GIVE US
JamesBalog_2009G BECAUSE WE FEEL VERY MUCH THE NEED TO TELL THIS STORY BECAUSE IT IS SUCH AN IMMEDIATE EVIDENCE OF ONGOING CLIMATE CHANGE RIGHT NOW
JamesBalog_2009G NOW ONE BIT OF SCIENCE BEFORE WE GET INTO THE VISUALS IF EVERYBODY IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD UNDERSTOOD THIS GRAPH
JamesBalog_2009G AND EMBLAZONED IT ON THE INSIDE OF THEIR FOREHEADS THERE WOULD BE NO FURTHER SOCIETAL ARGUMENT ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE THIS IS THE STORY THAT COUNTS EVERYTHING ELSE YOU HEAR IS JUST PROPAGANDA AND CONFUSION
JamesBalog_2009G KEY ISSUES THIS IS A FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND YEAR RECORD THIS
JamesBalog_2009G AND SEVERAL THINGS ARE IMPORTANT NUMBER ONE TEMPERATURE AND CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE ATMOSPHERE GO UP AND DOWN BASICALLY IN SYNC YOU CAN SEE THAT FROM THE ORANGE LINE AND THE BLUE LINE
JamesBalog_2009G RIGHT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP RIGHT PART OF THAT GRAPH WE'RE AT THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE PARTS PER MILLION WE ARE WAY WAY OUTSIDE THE NORMAL NATURAL VARIABILITY
JamesBalog_2009G EARTH IS HAVING A FEVER IN THE PAST HUNDRED YEARS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH HAS GONE UP ONE POINT THREE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT SEVENTY FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS
JamesBalog_2009G AND IT'S GOING TO KEEP GOING UP BECAUSE WE KEEP DUMPING FOSSIL FUELS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AT THE RATE OF ABOUT TWO AND A HALF PARTS PER MILLION PER YEAR IT'S BEEN A REMORSELESS STEADY INCREASE WE HAVE TO TURN THAT AROUND
JamesBalog_2009G THAT'S THE CRUX AND SOMEDAY I HOPE TO EMBLAZON THAT ACROSS TIMES SQUARE IN NEW YORK AND A LOT OF OTHER PLACES BUT ANYWAY OFF TO THE WORLD OF ICE
JamesBalog_2009G THE COLUMBIA GLACIER IN ALASKA THIS IS A VIEW OF WHAT'S CALLED THE CALVING FACE THIS IS WHAT ONE OF OUR CAMERAS SAW OVER THE COURSE OF A FEW MONTHS YOU SEE SEE THE GLACIER FLOWING IN FROM THE RIGHT
JamesBalog_2009G DROPPING OFF INTO THE SEA CAMERA SHOOTING EVERY HOUR IF YOU LOOK IN THE MIDDLE BACKGROUND YOU CAN SEE THE CALVING FACE BOBBING UP AND DOWN LIKE A
JamesBalog_2009G THAT MEANS THAT GLACIER 'S FLOATING AND IT'S UNSTABLE AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT FLOATING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A SENSE OF SCALE
JamesBalog_2009G THAT CALVING FACE IN THIS PICTURE IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FT TALL THAT'S THIRTY TWO STORIES
JamesBalog_2009G THIS IS NOT A LITTLE CLIFF THIS IS LIKE A MAJOR OFFICE BUILDING IN AN URBAN CENTER THE CALVING FACE IS THE WALL WHERE THE VISIBLE ICE BREAKS OFF BUT IN FACT IT GOES DOWN BELOW SEA LEVEL
JamesBalog_2009G HERE 'S WHAT COLUMBIA 'S DONE THIS IS IN SOUTH CENTRAL ALASKA
JamesBalog_2009G THIS WAS AN AERIAL PICTURE I DID ONE DAY IN JUNE THREE YEARS AGO
JamesBalog_2009G THIS IS AN AERIAL PICTURE WE DID THIS YEAR
JamesBalog_2009G THAT'S THE RETREAT OF THIS GLACIER THE MAIN STEM THE MAIN FLOW OF THE GLACIER IS COMING FROM THE RIGHT AND IT'S GOING VERY RAPIDLY UP THAT STEM WE'RE GOING TO BE UP THERE IN JUST A FEW MORE WEEKS
JamesBalog_2009G AND WE EXPECT THAT IT'S PROBABLY RETREATED ANOTHER HALF A MILE BUT IF I GOT THERE AND DISCOVERED THAT IT HAD COLLAPSED AND IT WAS FIVE MILES FURTHER BACK I WOULDN'T BE THE LEAST BIT SURPRISED
JamesBalog_2009G NOW IT'S REALLY HARD TO GRASP THE SCALE OF THESE PLACES BECAUSE AS THE GLACIERS ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT PLACES LIKE ALASKA AND GREENLAND ARE HUGE THEY'RE NOT NORMAL LANDSCAPES
JamesBalog_2009G BUT AS THE GLACIERS ARE RETREATING THEY'RE ALSO DEFLATING LIKE AIR BEING LET OUT OF A BALLOON
JamesBalog_2009G AND SO THERE ARE FEATURES ON THIS LANDSCAPE THERE'S A RIDGE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PICTURE UP ABOVE WHERE THAT ARROW COMES IN THAT SHOWS YOU THAT A LITTLE BIT THERE'S A MARKER LINE CALLED THE TRIM LINE ABOVE
JamesBalog_2009G LITTLE RED ILLUSTRATION THERE THIS IS SOMETHING NO SELF RESPECTING PHOTOGRAPHER WOULD EVER DO YOU PUT SOME CHEESY ILLUSTRATION ON HIS SHOT RIGHT AND
JamesBalog_2009G HIGHER THAN THE EIFFEL TOWER HIGHER THAN THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ICE HAS BEEN LET OUT OF THESE VALLEYS AS IT'S RETREATED AND DEFLATED GONE BACK
JamesBalog_2009G THESE CHANGES IN THE ALPINE WORLD ARE ACCELERATING IT'S NOT STATIC PARTICULARLY IN THE WORLD OF SEA ICE THE RATE OF NATURAL CHANGE IS OUTSTRIPPING PREDICTIONS OF JUST A FEW YEARS AGO AND THE PROCESSES
JamesBalog_2009G ARE ACCELERATING OR THE PREDICTIONS WERE TOO LOW TO BEGIN WITH BUT IN ANY CASE THERE ARE BIG BIG CHANGES HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK SO HERE 'S ANOTHER TIME LAPSE SHOT OF COLUMBIA
JamesBalog_2009G AND YOU SEE WHERE IT ENDED IN THESE VARIOUS SPRING DAYS JUNE MAY THEN OCTOBER NOW WE TURN ON OUR TIME LAPSE THIS CAMERA WAS SHOOTING EVERY HOUR
JamesBalog_2009G YOU CAN LOOK AT THESE PICTURES OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH A STRANGE BIZARRE FASCINATION IN SEEING THESE THINGS YOU DON'T NORMALLY GET TO SEE COME ALIVE
JamesBalog_2009G HUGE CREVASSES OPEN UP THESE GREAT ICE ISLANDS BREAK OFF
JamesBalog_2009G HUGE COLLAPSE THAT HAPPENED IN ABOUT A MONTH THE LOSS OF ALL THAT ICE
JamesBalog_2009G ON UP TO ICELAND
JamesBalog_2009G ONE OF MY FAVORITE GLACIERS
JamesBalog_2009G AND HERE IF YOU WATCH YOU CAN SEE THE TERMINUS RETREATING YOU CAN SEE THIS RIVER BEING FORMED YOU CAN SEE IT DEFLATING
JamesBalog_2009G SO WE WIND TIME BACKWARDS NOW
JamesBalog_2009G GO BACK A COUPLE YEARS IN TIME
JamesBalog_2009G AND ON UP TO GREENLAND THE SMALLER THE
JamesBalog_2009G ICE MASS THE FASTER IT RESPONDS TO CLIMATE GREENLAND TOOK A LITTLE WHILE TO START REACTING TO THE WARMING CLIMATE OF THE PAST CENTURY BUT IT REALLY STARTED GALLOPING ALONG ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO
JamesBalog_2009G ONE GLACIER IN GREENLAND THAT PUTS MORE ICE INTO THE GLOBAL OCEAN THAN ALL THE OTHER GLACIERS IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE COMBINED THE ILULISSAT GLACIER WE HAVE SOME CAMERAS ON THE SOUTH EDGE OF THE
JamesBalog_2009G WATCHING THE CALVING FACE AS IT GOES THROUGH THIS DRAMATIC RETREAT HERE 'S A TWO YEAR RECORD OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE THE HELICOPTER IS IN FRONT OF THE CALVING FACE FOR SCALE
JamesBalog_2009G QUICKLY DWARFED THE CALVING FACE IS FOUR AND A HALF MILES ACROSS AND IN THIS SHOT AS WE PULL BACK YOU'RE ONLY SEEING ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF OF IT SO IMAGINE HOW BIG THIS IS AND HOW MUCH ICE IS CHARGING OUT
JamesBalog_2009G THE INTERIOR OF GREENLAND IS TO THE RIGHT IT'S FLOWING OUT TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN ON THE LEFT ICEBERGS MANY MANY MANY TIMES THE SIZE OF THIS BUILDING ARE ROARING OUT TO SEA
JamesBalog_2009G WE JUST DOWNLOADED THESE PICTURES A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AS YOU CAN SEE JUNE TWENTY FIFTH
JamesBalog_2009G OKAY WE HAD A TEAM OUT WATCHING THIS GLACIER AND WE RECORDED THE BIGGEST CALVING EVENT THAT'S EVER BEEN PUT ON FILM WE HAD NINE CAMERAS GOING THIS IS WHAT A COUPLE OF THE CAMERAS SAW
JamesBalog_2009G FOUR HUNDRED FOOT TALL CALVING FACE BREAKING OFF
JamesBalog_2009G HUGE HUGE ICEBERGS ROLLING OVER
JamesBalog_2009G OKAY HOW BIG WAS THAT IT'S HARD TO GET IT SO AN ILLUSTRATION AGAIN GIVES YOU A FEELING FOR SCALE A MILE OF RETREAT IN SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES ACROSS THE CALVING FACE OF THAT PARTICULAR VENT THREE MILES WIDE
JamesBalog_2009G YOU PACK THREE THOUSAND CAPITOL BUILDINGS INTO THAT BLOCK IT WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO HOW LARGE THAT BLOCK WAS
JamesBalog_2009G SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES
JamesBalog_2009G THE POLICY AND THE ECONOMICS AND THE TECHNOLOGY ARE SERIOUS ENOUGH ISSUES BUT WE ACTUALLY CAN DEAL WITH THEM I'M CERTAIN THAT WE CAN BUT WHAT WE HAVE IS A PERCEPTION PROBLEM BECAUSE NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE REALLY GET IT YET
JamesBalog_2009G YOU'RE AN ELITE AUDIENCE YOU GET IT
JamesBalog_2009G LIKE THE EXTREME ICE SURVEY CAN HAVE A TERRIFIC IMPACT ON HUMAN PERCEPTION AND BRING US ALONG BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW
JamesBalog_2009G WE ARE NEARLY ON THE EDGE OF A CRISIS BUT WE STILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FACE THE GREATEST CHALLENGE OF OUR
