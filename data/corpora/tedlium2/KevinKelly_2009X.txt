KevinKelly_2009X@17.58:28.66 MY INVESTIGATIONS INTO WHAT TECHNOLOGY MEANS IN OUR LIVES NOT JUST OUR IMMEDIATE LIFE BUT IN THE COSMIC SENSE IN THE KIND OF LONG HISTORY OF
KevinKelly_2009X@29.01:37.42 THE WORLD AND OUR PLACE IN THE WORLD WHAT IS THIS STUFF WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE AND SO I WANT TO KIND OF GO THROUGH
KevinKelly_2009X@38.12:45.24 MY LITTLE STORY OF WHAT I FOUND OUT AND ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT I STARTED TO INVESTIGATE WAS THE HISTORY OF THE NAME OF TECHNOLOGY
KevinKelly_2009X@97.85:108.86 SO WHAT IS THIS STUFF THAT WE'RE ALL CONSUMED BY AND BOTHERED BY ALAN KAY CALLS IT TECHNOLOGY IS ANYTHING THAT WAS INVENTED AFTER YOU WERE BORN
KevinKelly_2009X@110.08:119.13 WHICH IS SORT OF THE IDEA THAT WE NORMALLY HAVE OF ABOUT WHAT TECHNOLOGY IS IT'S ALL THAT NEW STUFF IT'S NOT ROADS OR PENICILLIN OR
KevinKelly_2009X@128.20:134.65 WHICH IS AGAIN A SENSE THAT IT'S ALL NEW BUT WE KNOW THAT IT'S JUST NOT NEW IT ACTUALLY GOES WAY BACK AND WHAT I WANT TO SUGGEST IS IT GOES
KevinKelly_2009X@136.69:137.76 WAY BACK
KevinKelly_2009X@138.27:150.23 SO ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT TECHNOLOGY WHAT IT MEANS IS TO IMAGINE A WORLD WITHOUT TECHNOLOGY IF WE WERE TO ELIMINATE EVERY SINGLE BIT OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORLD TODAY AND I MEAN EVERYTHING FROM BLADES TO SCRAPERS TO
KevinKelly_2009X@151.68:158.54 WE AS A SPECIES WOULD NOT LIVE VERY LONG WE WOULD DIE BY THE BILLIONS AND VERY QUICKLY THE WOLVES WOULD GET US
KevinKelly_2009X@159.24:167.05 WE WOULD BE DEFENSELESS WE WOULD BE UNABLE TO GROW ENOUGH FOOD OR FIND ENOUGH FOOD EVEN THE HUNTER GATHERERS USED SOME ELEMENTARY TOOLS
KevinKelly_2009X@167.50:176.91 AND SO THEY HAD MINIMAL TECHNOLOGY BUT THEY HAD SOME TECHNOLOGY AND IF WE STUDY THOSE HUNTER GATHERER TRIBES AND THE NEANDERTHAL WHICH ARE VERY SIMILAR TO
KevinKelly_2009X@177.40:185.61 EARLY MAN WE FIND OUT A VERY CURIOUS THING ABOUT THIS WORLD WITHOUT TECHNOLOGY AND THIS IS A KIND OF A CURVE OF THEIR AVERAGE AGE THERE ARE NO
KevinKelly_2009X@197.23:208.23 INFANTS BECAUSE THEY DIE HIGH MORTALITY RATE AND THERE IS VERY FEW OLD PEOPLE AND SO THE PROFILE IS SORT OF FOR YOUR AVERAGE SAN FRANCISCO NEIGHBORHOOD A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND IF YOU GO THERE YOU SAY HEY EVERYBODY IS REALLY HEALTHY
KevinKelly_2009X@217.98:230.42 AND GRANDPARENTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY ARE THE TRANSMITTER OF CULTURAL EVOLUTION AND INFORMATION IMAGINE A WORLD AND BASICALLY EVERYONE WAS TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS OLD HOW MUCH LEARNING CAN YOU DO YOU CAN'T DO VERY MUCH LEARNING IN YOUR OWN LIFE
KevinKelly_2009X@233.53:234.98 DO LEARN SO
KevinKelly_2009X@236.54:247.40 THAT'S ONE ASPECT IT WAS A VERY SHORT LIFE BUT AT THE SAME TIME ANTHROPOLOGISTS KNOW THAT MOST HUNTER GATHERER TRIBES OF THE WORLD WITH VERY LITTLE TECHNOLOGY ACTUALLY DID NOT SPEND A VERY LONG TIME
KevinKelly_2009X@257.63:260.49 SO IT WAS POSSIBLE TO GET ENOUGH FOOD BUT
KevinKelly_2009X@261.18:269.60 WHEN THE SCARCITY CAME WHEN THE HIGHS AND LOWS AND THE DROUGHTS CAME THEN PEOPLE WENT INTO STARVATION AND THAT'S WHY THEY DIDN'T LIVE VERY LONG SO
KevinKelly_2009X@270.30:276.05 WHAT TECHNOLOGY BROUGHT THROUGH THE VERY SIMPLE TOOLS LIKE THESE STONE TOOLS HERE
KevinKelly_2009X@276.87:288.08 EVEN SOMETHING AS SMALL AS THIS THE EARLY BANDS OF HUMANS WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO ELIMINATE TO EXTINCTION ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY
KevinKelly_2009X@291.33:298.46 SO LONG BEFORE THE INDUSTRIAL AGE WE'VE BEEN AFFECTING THE PLANET ON A GLOBAL SCALE WITH JUST A SMALL AMOUNT OF TECHNOLOGY
KevinKelly_2009X@298.80:307.64 THE OTHER THING THAT THE EARLY MAN INVENTED WAS FIRE AND FIRE WAS USED TO CLEAR OUT AND AGAIN EFFECTED THE ECOLOGY OF GRASS AND WHOLE CONTINENTS
KevinKelly_2009X@308.15:316.41 AND WAS USED IN COOKING IT ENABLED US TO ACTUALLY EAT ALL KINDS OF THINGS IT WAS SORT OF IN A CERTAIN SENSE IN A MCLUHAN SENSE AN EXTERNAL STOMACH
KevinKelly_2009X@342.55:349.76 AND VERY QUICKLY BECAME THE DOMINANT SPECIES ON THE PLANET AND THEY MIGRATED INTO THE REST OF THE WORLD AT TWO KILOMETERS PER YEAR UNTIL
KevinKelly_2009X@350.22:358.67 WITHIN SEVERAL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS WE OCCUPIED EVERY SINGLE WATERSHED ON THE PLANET AND BECAME THE MOST DOMINANT SPECIES WITH A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF TECHNOLOGY
KevinKelly_2009X@359.17:371.59 AND EVEN AT THAT TIME WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF AGRICULTURE EIGHT THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO WE STARTED TO SEE CLIMATE CHANGE SO CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT A NEW THING WHAT'S NEW IS JUST THE DEGREE OF IT EVEN DURING THE AGRICULTURAL AGE THERE WAS CLIMATE CHANGE
KevinKelly_2009X@372.29:382.49 SO ALREADY SMALL AMOUNTS OF TECHNOLOGY WERE TRANSFORMING THE WORLD AND WHAT THIS MEANS AND WHERE I'M GOING IS THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS BECOME THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE IN THE WORLD
KevinKelly_2009X@382.77:392.14 ALL THE THINGS THAT WE SEE TODAY THAT ARE CHANGING OUR LIVES WE CAN ALWAYS TRACE BACK TO THE INTRODUCTION OF SOME NEW TECHNOLOGY SO IT'S A FORCE THAT IS THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE
KevinKelly_2009X@392.33:397.68 THAT HAS BEEN UNLEASHED ON THIS PLANET AND IN SUCH A DEGREE THAT I THINK THAT
KevinKelly_2009X@408.58:412.94 THE ANIMALS THAT WE'VE DOMESTICATED THE MOST IMPORTANT ANIMAL THAT WE'VE DOMESTICATED HAS BEEN US
KevinKelly_2009X@413.72:414.64 OKAY SO
KevinKelly_2009X@425.21:434.04 IT'S A VERY VERY STRONG FORCE I CALL THIS ENTIRE THING US HUMANS AS OUR TECHNOLOGY EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE MADE GADGETS IN OUR LIVES WE CALL THAT THE TECHNIUM
KevinKelly_2009X@434.30:442.94 THAT'S THIS WORLD MY WORKING DEFINITION OF TECHNOLOGY IS ANYTHING USEFUL THAT A HUMAN MIND MAKES IT'S NOT JUST HAMMERS AND GADGETS LIKE LAPTOPS
KevinKelly_2009X@443.45:449.37 ALSO LAW AND OF COURSE CITIES ARE WAYS TO MAKE THINGS MORE USEFUL TO US
KevinKelly_2009X@449.90:460.36 WHILE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COMES FROM OUR MIND IT ALSO HAS ITS ROOTS DEEPLY INTO THE COSMOS IT GOES BACK THE ORIGINS AND ROOTS OF TECHNOLOGY GO BACK TO THE BIG BANG
KevinKelly_2009X@460.61:467.25 IN THIS WAY IN THAT THEY ARE PART OF THIS SELF ORGANIZING THREAD THAT STARTS AT THE BIG BANG AND GOES THROUGH
KevinKelly_2009X@481.30:489.77 FOUR BILLION YEARS AGO THE DOMINANT FORCE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD BECAME INFORMATION THAT'S WHAT LIFE IS IT'S AN INFORMATION PROCESS THAT WAS RESTRUCTURING AND MAKING NEW ORDER SO
KevinKelly_2009X@490.49:503.43 THOSE ENERGY MATTER EINSTEIN SHOWED WERE EQUIVALENT AND NOW NEW SCIENCES OF QUANTUM COMPUTING SHOW THAT ENTROPY AND INFORMATION AND MATTER AND ENERGY ARE ALL INTERRELATED SO IT'S ONE LONG CONTINUUM
KevinKelly_2009X@504.37:512.45 YOU PUT ENERGY INTO THE RIGHT KIND OF SYSTEM AND OUT COMES WASTED HEAT ENTROPY AND EXTROPY WHICH IS
KevinKelly_2009X@513.16:521.68 ORDER IT'S THE INCREASE IN ORDER SO WHERE DOES THIS ORDER COME FROM ITS ROOTS GO WAY BACK WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE SELF ORGANIZATION
KevinKelly_2009X@522.05:529.08 TREND THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE IS LONG AND IT BEGAN WITH THINGS LIKE GALAXIES THEY MAINTAINED THEIR ORDER FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS
KevinKelly_2009X@529.73:540.71 STARS ARE BASICALLY NUCLEAR FUSION MACHINES THAT SELF ORGANIZE AND SELF SUSTAIN THEMSELVES FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS THIS ORDER AGAINST THE ENTROPY OF THE WORLD AND FLOWERS AND
KevinKelly_2009X@541.16:548.72 PLANTS ARE THE SAME THING EXTENDED AND TECHNOLOGY IS BASICALLY AN EXTENSION OF LIFE SO
KevinKelly_2009X@549.65:555.43 ONE TREND THAT WE NOTICE IN ALL THOSE THINGS IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY PER
KevinKelly_2009X@557.59:567.30 THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY IS INCREASING THROUGH THIS LITTLE SEQUENCE AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY PER GRAM PER SECOND THAT FLOWS THROUGH LIFE IS ACTUALLY GREATER
KevinKelly_2009X@567.58:576.16 THAN A STAR BECAUSE OF THE STAR 'S LONG LIFESPAN THE ENERGY DENSITY IN LIFE IS ACTUALLY HIGHER THAN A STAR AND THE ENERGY DENSITY
KevinKelly_2009X@576.66:586.19 THAT WE SEE IN THE GREATEST THAT WE SEE ANYWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE IS ACTUALLY IN A P C CHIP THERE IS MORE ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH PER GRAM PER SECOND THAN ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE ANY OTHER EXPERIENCE WITH
KevinKelly_2009X@586.43:595.38 SO WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHERE TECHNOLOGY IS GOING WE CONTINUE THAT TRAJECTORY AND WE SAY WELL WHAT'S GOING TO BECOME MORE ENERGY DENSE
KevinKelly_2009X@595.66:603.01 THAT'S WHERE IT'S GOING AND SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS I'VE TAKEN THE SAME KINDS OF THINGS AND LOOKED AT OTHER ASPECTS OF EVOLUTIONARY LIFE AND SAY
KevinKelly_2009X@603.34:612.06 WHAT ARE THE GENERAL TRENDS IN EVOLUTIONARY LIFE AND THERE ARE THINGS MOVING TOWARDS GREATER COMPLEXITY MOVING TOWARDS GREATER DIVERSITY MOVING TOWARDS GREATER SPECIALIZATION
KevinKelly_2009X@612.96:622.06 SENTIENCE UBIQUITY AND MOST IMPORTANT EVOLVABILITY THOSE VERY SAME THINGS ARE ALSO PRESENT IN TECHNOLOGY THAT'S WHERE TECHNOLOGY IS GOING
KevinKelly_2009X@622.33:632.40 IN FACT TECHNOLOGY IS ACCELERATING ALL THE ASPECTS OF LIFE AND WE CAN SEE THAT HAPPENING JUST AS THERE IS DIVERSITY IN LIFE THERE IS MORE DIVERSITY IN THINGS WE MAKE
KevinKelly_2009X@633.41:642.72 THINGS IN LIFE START OUT BEING GENERAL CELL AND THEY BECOME SPECIALIZED YOU HAVE TISSUE CELLS YOU HAVE MUSCLE BRAIN CELLS AND SAME THINGS HAPPENS WITH SAY A HAMMER WHICH IS GENERAL AT FIRST AND BECOMES MORE SPECIFIC
KevinKelly_2009X@643.22:652.27 SO I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WHILE THERE IS SIX KINGDOMS OF LIFE WE CAN THINK OF TECHNOLOGY BASICALLY AS A SEVENTH KINGDOM OF LIFE IT'S A BRANCHING OFF FROM THE HUMAN FORM
KevinKelly_2009X@652.84:664.47 BUT TECHNOLOGY HAS ITS OWN AGENDA LIKE ANYTHING LIKE LIFE ITSELF FOR INSTANCE RIGHT NOW THREE QUARTERS OF THE ENERGY THAT WE USE IS ACTUALLY USED TO FEED THE TECHNIUM ITSELF IN TRANSPORTATION IT'S NOT TO MOVE US IT'S TO MOVE THE STUFF THAT WE MAKE
KevinKelly_2009X@664.66:672.67 OR BUY I USE THE WORD WANT TECHNOLOGY WANTS THIS IS A ROBOT THAT WANTS TO PLUG ITSELF IN TO GET MORE POWER YOUR CAT WANTS MORE FOOD
KevinKelly_2009X@673.17:684.40 A BACTERIUM WHICH HAS NO CONSCIOUSNESS AT ALL WANTS TO MOVE TOWARDS LIGHT IT HAS AN URGE AND TECHNOLOGY HAS AN URGE AT THE SAME TIME IT WANTS TO GIVE US THINGS AND WHAT IT GIVES US IS BASICALLY PROGRESS
KevinKelly_2009X@685.01:693.90 YOU CAN TAKE ALL KINDS OF CURVES AND THEY'RE ALL POINTING UP THERE IS REALLY NO DISPUTE ABOUT PROGRESS IF WE DISCOUNT THE COST OF THAT
KevinKelly_2009X@694.55:703.75 THE THING THAT BOTHERS MOST PEOPLE IS THAT PROGRESS IS REALLY REAL BUT WE WONDER AND QUESTION WHAT ARE THE ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS OF IT I DID A SURVEY OF A NUMBER OF SPECIES OF
KevinKelly_2009X@718.16:726.53 AND WITH THAT ENTIRE WEALTH OF ENGLAND KING HENRY COULD NOT BUY ANY ANTIBIOTICS HE COULD NOT BUY REFRIGERATION HE COULD NOT BUY A TRIP OF A THOUSAND MILES
KevinKelly_2009X@726.90:730.68 WHEREAS THIS RICKSHAW WALE IN INDIA
KevinKelly_2009X@752.57:762.37 RIGHT NOW THE DEFAULT POSITION ABOUT WHEN A NEW TECHNOLOGY COMES ALONG IS WE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE WHICH IS VERY COMMON IN EUROPE WHICH SAYS BASICALLY DON 'T DO ANYTHING
KevinKelly_2009X@775.74:790.08 YOU TRY IT OUT YOU OBVIOUSLY DO WHAT THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE SUGGESTS YOU TRY TO ANTICIPATE IT BUT AFTER ANTICIPATING IT YOU CONSTANTLY ASSES IT NOT JUST ONCE BUT ETERNALLY AND WHEN IT DIVERTS FROM WHAT YOU WANT
KevinKelly_2009X@790.45:799.40 WE PRIORITIZE RISK WE EVALUATE NOT JUST THE NEW STUFF BUT THE OLD STUFF WE FIX IT BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WE RELOCATE IT AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT
KevinKelly_2009X@819.92:826.82 THE RESPONSE TO A BAD IDEA LIKE SAY A TUNGSTEN LIGHTBULB IS A BETTER IDEA OKAY
KevinKelly_2009X@827.52:841.15 BETTER IDEAS IS REALLY ALWAYS THE RESPONSE TO TECHNOLOGY THAT WE DON'T LIKE IS BASICALLY BETTER TECHNOLOGY ACTUALLY IN A CERTAIN SENSE TECHNOLOGY IS A KIND OF A METHOD FOR GENERATING BETTER IDEAS IF YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY
KevinKelly_2009X@841.60:848.58 SO MAYBE SPRAYING DDT ON CROPS IS A REALLY BAD IDEA BUT DDT SPRAYED ON LOCAL HOMES THERE IS NOTHING BETTER
KevinKelly_2009X@848.84:857.45 TO ELIMINATE MALARIA BESIDES INSECT DDT IMPREGNATED MOSQUITO NETS BUT THAT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA THAT'S A GOOD JOB FOR TECHNOLOGY
KevinKelly_2009X@857.83:867.95 SO OUR JOB AS HUMANS IS TO PARENT OUR MIND CHILDREN TO FIND THEM GOOD FRIENDS TO FIND THEM A GOOD JOB AND SO EVERY TECHNOLOGY IS SORT OF A CREATIVE FORCE LOOKING FOR
KevinKelly_2009X@868.28:881.22 THE RIGHT JOB THAT'S ACTUALLY MY SON RIGHT HERE THERE ARE NO BAD TECHNOLOGIES JUST AS THERE ARE NO BAD CHILDREN WE DON'T SAY CHILDREN ARE NEUTRAL OR CHILDREN ARE POSITIVE WE JUST HAVE TO FIND THEM THE RIGHT
KevinKelly_2009X@882.50:892.42 SO WHAT TECHNOLOGY GIVES US OVER THE LONG TERM OVER THE SORT OF EXTENDED EVOLUTION FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME THROUGH THE INVENTION OF THE PLANTS
KevinKelly_2009X@907.20:917.60 THAT'S WHAT WE GET FROM TECHNOLOGY ALL THE TIME THAT'S WHY PEOPLE LEAVE VILLAGES AND GO INTO CITIES IS BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS GRAVITATING TOWARDS INCREASED CHOICES AND POSSIBILITIES
KevinKelly_2009X@917.96:926.65 AND WE ARE AWARE OF THE PRICE WE PAY A PRICE FOR THAT BUT WE ARE AWARE OF IT AND GENERALLY WE WILL PAY THE PRICE FOR INCREASED FREEDOMS CHOICES AND OPPORTUNITIES
KevinKelly_2009X@927.68:936.27 EVEN TECHNOLOGY WANTS CLEAN WATER IS TECHNOLOGY DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO NATURE BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY IS AN EXTENSION
KevinKelly_2009X@936.58:945.40 OF LIFE IT'S IN PARALLEL AND ALIGNED WITH THE SAME THINGS THAT LIFE WANTS SO THAT I THINK TECHNOLOGY LOVES BIOLOGY IF WE ALLOW IT
KevinKelly_2009X@946.66:954.90 GREAT MOVEMENT THAT IS STARTING BILLIONS OF YEARS AGO IS MOVING THROUGH US AND IT CONTINUES TO GO AND OUR CHOICE SO TO SPEAK
KevinKelly_2009X@955.23:966.40 IN TECHNOLOGY IS REALLY TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THIS FORCE MUCH GREATER THAN OURSELVES SO TECHNOLOGY IS MORE THAN JUST THE STUFF IN YOUR POCKET IT'S MORE THAN JUST GADGETS IT'S MORE THAN JUST THINGS THAT PEOPLE INVENT IT'S ACTUALLY
KevinKelly_2009X@966.98:975.24 PART OF A VERY LONG STORY A GREAT STORY THAT BEGAN BILLIONS OF YEARS AGO AND IT MOVING THROUGH US THIS SELF ORGANIZATION AND WE'RE EXTENDING AND ACCELERATING IT
KevinKelly_2009X@975.33:983.57 AND WE CAN BE PART OF IT BY ALIGNING THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE MAKE WITH IT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TODAY THANK YOU
