JessicaJackley_2010G THE STORIES WE TELL ABOUT EACH OTHER
JessicaJackley_2010G MATTER VERY MUCH THE STORIES WE TELL OURSELVES ABOUT OUR OWN LIVES MATTER
JessicaJackley_2010G AND MOST OF ALL I THINK THE WAY THAT WE PARTICIPATE IN EACH OTHER 'S STORIES IS OF DEEP IMPORTANCE I WAS SIX YEARS OLD
JessicaJackley_2010G I FIRST HEARD STORIES ABOUT THE POOR NOW I DIDN'T HEAR THOSE STORIES FROM THE POOR THEMSELVES I HEARD THEM FROM MY SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER AND JESUS KIND OF VIA MY SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER
JessicaJackley_2010G I REMEMBER LEARNING THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE POOR NEEDED SOMETHING MATERIAL FOOD CLOTHING SHELTER THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE
JessicaJackley_2010G JESUS ASKED OF US AND THEN HE SAID WHAT YOU DO FOR THE LEAST OF THESE YOU DO FOR ME NOW I WAS PRETTY
JessicaJackley_2010G BUT I ALSO LEARNED VERY SOON THERE AFTER THAT JESUS ALSO SAID AND I'M PARAPHRASING THE POOR WOULD ALWAYS BE WITH US THIS FRUSTRATED AND CONFUSED ME I FELT LIKE I HAD BEEN JUST GIVEN A HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT THAT I HAD TO DO
JessicaJackley_2010G EXCITED TO DO BUT NO MATTER WHAT I WOULD DO I WOULD FAIL SO I FELT CONFUSED A LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY LIKE MAYBE I'D MISUNDERSTOOD SOMETHING HERE AND I FELT OVERWHELMED
JessicaJackley_2010G AND FOR THE FIRST TIME I BEGAN TO FEAR THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE AND TO FEEL NEGATIVE EMOTION TOWARDS A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE I IMAGINED IN MY HEAD A KIND OF LONG LINE OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE NEVER GOING AWAY THAT WOULD ALWAYS BE WITH US
JessicaJackley_2010G ME TO HELP THEM AND GIVE THEM THINGS WHICH I WAS EXCITED TO DO BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW IT WAS GOING TO WORK AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WHEN I RAN OUT OF THINGS TO GIVE
JessicaJackley_2010G I SAW PICTURES AND IMAGES FREQUENTLY OF SADNESS AND SUFFERING I HEARD ABOUT THINGS THAT WERE GOING WRONG IN THE LIVES OF THE POOR I HEARD ABOUT DISEASE I HEARD ABOUT WAR
JessicaJackley_2010G BECAUSE I WASN'T DOING MORE APPARENTLY TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND I EVEN FELT A SENSE OF SHAME BECAUSE OF THAT AND SO
JessicaJackley_2010G NOW I STILL GAVE ON THE OUTSIDE IT LOOKED LIKE I WAS STILL QUITE INVOLVED I GAVE OF MY TIME AND MY MONEY I GAVE WHEN SOLUTIONS WERE ON SALE THE COST OF A CUP OF COFFEE CAN SAVE A CHILD 'S LIFE RIGHT I MEAN WHO CAN ARGUE WITH THAT I GAVE WHEN I WAS
JessicaJackley_2010G WAS DIFFICULT TO AVOID AND I GAVE IN GENERAL WHEN THE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS BUILT UP ENOUGH THAT I GAVE TO RELIEVE MY OWN SUFFERING NOT SOMEONE ELSE 'S THE TRUTH BE TOLD
JessicaJackley_2010G I WAS GIVING OUT OF THAT PLACE NOT OUT OF A GENUINE PLACE OF HOPE AND EXCITEMENT TO HELP AND OF GENEROSITY IT BECAME A TRANSACTION FOR ME BECAME SORT OF A TRADE I WAS PURCHASING SOMETHING I WAS
JessicaJackley_2010G BUYING MY RIGHT TO GO ON WITH MY DAY AND NOT NECESSARILY BE BOTHERED BY THIS BAD NEWS AND I THINK THE WAY THAT WE GO THROUGH THAT SOMETIMES CAN
JessicaJackley_2010G I THINK THAT EXCHANGE CAN ACTUALLY GET IN THE WAY OF THE VERY THING THAT WE WANT MOST IT CAN GET IN THE WAY OF OUR DESIRE TO REALLY BE MEANINGFUL AND USEFUL IN ANOTHER PERSON 'S LIFE AND IN SHORT TO LOVE
JessicaJackley_2010G THIS IS NEW TO YOU AS WELL THINK OF THAT AS FINANCIAL SERVICES
JessicaJackley_2010G TINY LOAN THAT COULD HELP SOMEONE START OR GROW A BUSINESS NOW WHEN I HEARD HIM SPEAK IT WAS EXCITING FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS FIRST AND FOREMOST I LEARNED ABOUT THIS NEW METHOD OF CHANGE IN THE WORLD
JessicaJackley_2010G THAT FOR ONCE SHOWED ME MAYBE A WAY TO INTERACT WITH SOMEONE AND TO GIVE TO SHARE OF A RESOURCE IN A WAY THAT WASN'T WEIRD AND DIDN'T MAKE ME FEEL BAD THAT WAS EXCITING BUT
JessicaJackley_2010G MORE IMPORTANTLY HE TOLD STORIES ABOUT THE POOR THAT WERE DIFFERENT THAN ANY STORIES I HAD HEARD BEFORE IN FACT THOSE INDIVIDUALS HE TALKED ABOUT WHO WERE POOR WAS SORT OF A SIDE NOTE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT STRONG SMART
JessicaJackley_2010G IT WAS AN AMAZING SORT OF INSIGHT FOR ME AND I IN FACT WAS SO DEEPLY MOVED BY THIS IT'S HARD TO EXPRESS NOW HOW MUCH THAT AFFECTED ME BUT I WAS SO MOVED THAT I ACTUALLY QUIT MY JOB A FEW WEEKS LATER
JessicaJackley_2010G THE FIRST TIME I WAS STARTING TO GET TO BE FRIENDS WITH SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THAT BIG AMORPHOUS GROUP OUT THERE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FAR AWAY
JessicaJackley_2010G DID HEAR STORIES OF LIFE CHANGE AND AMAZING LITTLE DETAILS OF CHANGE SO I WOULD HEAR FROM GOAT HERDERS WHO HAD USED THAT MONEY THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED
JessicaJackley_2010G AND THEY WOULD MAKE REALLY INTERESTING LITTLE ADJUSTMENTS IN THEIR LIVES LIKE THEY WOULD START TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO BUY MOSQUITO NETS
JessicaJackley_2010G THESE BEAUTIFUL DETAILS OF LIFE CHANGE THAT WERE MEANINGFUL TO THEM THAT WAS ANOTHER THING THAT REALLY TOUCHED ME IT WAS REALLY HUMBLING TO SEE FOR THE FIRST TIME TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT
JessicaJackley_2010G ANOTHER INTERESTING THING HAPPENED WHILE I WAS THERE I NEVER ONCE WAS ASKED FOR A DONATION WHICH HAD KIND OF BEEN MY MODE RIGHT THERE'S POVERTY YOU GIVE MONEY TO HELP
JessicaJackley_2010G NO ONE ASKED ME FOR A DONATION IN FACT NO ONE WANTED ME TO FEEL BAD FOR THEM AT ALL IF ANYTHING THEY JUST WANTED TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING ALREADY AND TO BUILD ON THEIR OWN CAPABILITIES SO WHAT I DID HEAR ONCE IN A WHILE WAS THAT PEOPLE WANTED
JessicaJackley_2010G I THOUGHT THAT SOUNDED VERY REASONABLE AND REALLY EXCITING AND BY THE WAY I WAS A PHILOSOPHY AND POETRY MAJOR IN SCHOOL SO I DIDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROFIT AND REVENUE WHEN I WENT TO EAST AFRICA I JUST GOT THIS IMPRESSION THAT
JessicaJackley_2010G SO THIS IDEA THAT THESE NEW STORIES OF BUSINESS AND HOPE MIGHT BE SHARED WITH MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND THROUGH THAT MAYBE WE COULD GET SOME OF THE MONEY THAT THEY NEEDED
JessicaJackley_2010G TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THEIR BUSINESSES AS LOANS THAT'S THIS LITTLE IDEA THAT TURNED INTO KIVA A FEW MONTHS LATER I WENT BACK TO UGANDA WITH A DIGITAL CAMERA AND A BASIC WEBSITE THAT MY PARTNER MATTHEW AND I HAD KIND OF BUILT
JessicaJackley_2010G PICTURES OF SEVEN
JessicaJackley_2010G THEIR STORIES THESE STORIES OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP UP ON THE WEBSITE SPAMMED FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND SAID WE THINK THIS IS LEGAL HAVEN'T HEARD BACK YET FROM SEC ON ALL THE DETAILS BUT DO YOU SAY
JessicaJackley_2010G THEY WERE PAID AND THEIR BUSINESSES IN FACT GREW AND THEY WERE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THEIR LIVES IN OCTOBER OF FIVE
JessicaJackley_2010G THE SECOND YEAR IT WAS A TOTAL OF FIFTEEN MILLION THE THIRD YEAR THE TOTAL WAS UP TO AROUND FORTY THE FOURTH YEAR WE WERE JUST SHORT OF ONE HUNDRED AND TODAY LESS THAN FIVE YEARS IN KIVA 'S FACILITATED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN LITTLE TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR BITS
JessicaJackley_2010G FROM LENDERS AND ENTREPRENEURS MORE THAN A MILLION OF THOSE COLLECTIVELY IN TWO HUNDRED COUNTRIES SO THAT'S WHERE KIVA IS TODAY JUST TO BRING YOU RIGHT UP TO THE PRESENT AND WHILE THOSE NUMBERS AND THOSE STATISTICS ARE REALLY FUN TO TALK ABOUT AND THEY'RE INTERESTING
JessicaJackley_2010G TO ME KIVA 'S REALLY ABOUT STORIES IT'S ABOUT RETELLING THE STORY OF THE POOR AND IT'S ABOUT GIVING OURSELVES AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE
JessicaJackley_2010G THAT VALIDATES THEIR DIGNITY VALIDATES A PARTNERSHIP RELATIONSHIP NOT A RELATIONSHIP THAT'S BASED ON THE TRADITIONAL SORT OF DONOR BENEFICIARY
JessicaJackley_2010G BECAUSE AS THAT HAPPENS I THINK WE CAN FEEL FREE TO INTERACT IN A WAY THAT'S MORE OPEN MORE JUST AND MORE CREATIVE TO ENGAGE WITH EACH OTHER AND TO HELP EACH OTHER
JessicaJackley_2010G IMAGINE HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOU SEE SOMEBODY ON STREET WHO IS BEGGING AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO APPROACH THEM IMAGINE HOW YOU FEEL
JessicaJackley_2010G 'S USING THEIR TALENTS TO DO SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE SOMEBODY WHO 'S BUILT THEIR OWN BUSINESS
JessicaJackley_2010G NOT EMPTY HANDS ASKING FOR YOU TO GIVE THEM SOMETHING IMAGINE IF YOU COULD HEAR A STORY
JessicaJackley_2010G THESE INDIVIDUALS AND TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR STORY BY LENDING A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY I THINK THAT CAN CHANGE THE WAY WE BELIEVE IN EACH OTHER AND EACH OTHER 'S POTENTIAL
JessicaJackley_2010G NOW FOR ME KIVA IS JUST THE BEGINNING AND AS I LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT IS NEXT IT'S BEEN HELPFUL TO REFLECT ON THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED SO FAR
JessicaJackley_2010G THE FIRST ONE IS AS I MENTIONED ENTREPRENEURSHIP WAS A NEW IDEA TO ME KIVA BORROWERS AS I INTERVIEWED THEM AND GOT TO KNOW THEM OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE TAUGHT ME WHAT ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS AND I THINK AT ITS CORE
JessicaJackley_2010G AND THEY SLOWLY PAY YOU BACK OVER TIME YOU HAVE THIS EXCUSE TO HAVE AN ONGOING DIALOGUE THIS CONTINUED ATTENTION THIS ONGOING ATTENTION IS A REALLY BIG DEAL TO BUILD DIFFERENT KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS AMONG US
JessicaJackley_2010G FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM THE ENTREPRENEURS I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW WHEN ALL ELSE IS EQUAL GIVEN THE OPTION TO HAVE JUST MONEY TO DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO OR MONEY PLUS THE SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF A GLOBAL COMMUNITY PEOPLE CHOOSE
JessicaJackley_2010G THE COMMUNITY PLUS THE MONEY THAT'S A MUCH MORE MEANINGFUL COMBINATION A MORE POWERFUL COMBINATION SO WITH THAT IN MIND THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT HAS LED TO
JessicaJackley_2010G THE THINGS THAT I'M WORKING ON NOW I SEE ENTREPRENEURS EVERYWHERE NOW NOW THAT I'M TUNED INTO THIS AND ONE THING THAT I'VE SEEN IS THERE ARE A LOT OF SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITIES THAT ALREADY EXIST IN THE WORLD WITH SOCIAL NETWORKS IT'S AN AMAZING WAY
JessicaJackley_2010G IDEAS AND TO CATALYZE ALL OF US TO MAKE TOMORROW BETTER THAN TODAY AS I'VE RESEARCHED WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE UNITED STATES A FEW INTERESTING LITTLE INSIGHTS HAVE COME UP SO ONE IS THAT OF COURSE AS WE ALL MIGHT EXPECT
JessicaJackley_2010G CLOSE BY ANOTHER THING IS IT TURNS OUT THOSE RESOURCES DON'T USUALLY COME FROM THE PLACES YOU MIGHT EXPECT BANKS VENTURE CAPITALISTS OTHER ORGANIZATIONS
JessicaJackley_2010G TO HARNESS THE POWER OF THESE SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITIES IN A NEW WAY AND TO ALLOW ENTREPRENEURS TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES EXACTLY WHAT THAT FINANCIAL EXCHANGE SHOULD LOOK LIKE EXACTLY WHAT FITS THEM AND THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM
JessicaJackley_2010G THIS WEEK ACTUALLY WE'RE QUIETLY DOING A LAUNCH OF PROFOUNDER WHICH IS A CROWD FUNDING PLATFORM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO RAISE WHAT THEY NEED THROUGH INVESTMENTS FROM THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND IT'S INVESTMENTS NOT
JessicaJackley_2010G TO GATHER THEM TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN SO
JessicaJackley_2010G WHAT WE NEED ARE FOR PEOPLE TO CARE TO ACTUALLY GO USE IT JUST LIKE THEY'VE CARED ENOUGH TO USE KIVA TO MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS I DON'T THINK I NEED TO STAND HERE AND CONVINCE YOU TO CARE I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO TRY I DON'T THINK
JessicaJackley_2010G I THINK WE KNOW SO MUCH AND IT'S SUCH A REALITY THAT WE CARE SO DEEPLY THAT IN FACT WHAT USUALLY STOPS US IS THAT WE'RE AFRAID
JessicaJackley_2010G TO TRY AND TO MESS UP BECAUSE WE CARE SO VERY MUCH ABOUT HELPING EACH OTHER AND BEING MEANINGFUL IN EACH OTHER 'S LIVES SO
JessicaJackley_2010G WHAT I THINK I CAN DO TODAY THAT BEST THING I CAN GIVE YOU I'VE GIVEN YOU MY STORY WHICH IS THE BEST I CAN DO AND I THINK I CAN REMIND US THAT
JessicaJackley_2010G WE DO CARE I THINK WE ALL ALREADY KNOW THAT AND I THINK WE KNOW THAT LOVE IS RESILIENT ENOUGH FOR US TO GET OUT THERE AND TRY
JessicaJackley_2010G ME THE BEST WAY TO BE INSPIRED TO TRY IS TO STOP AND TO LISTEN TO SOMEONE ELSE'S STORY AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT I'VE GOTTEN TO DO THAT HERE AT TED
JessicaJackley_2010G AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT WHENEVER I DO THAT GUARANTEED I AM INSPIRED I AM INSPIRED BY THE PERSON I AM LISTENING TO AND I BELIEVE MORE AND MORE EVERY TIME I LISTEN IN THAT THAT PERSON 'S POTENTIAL
JessicaJackley_2010G TO DO GREAT THINGS IN THE WORLD AND IN MY OWN POTENTIAL TO MAYBE HELP AND THAT FORGET THE TOOLS FORGET THE MOVING AROUND OF RESOURCES THAT
JessicaJackley_2010G THAT IS WHAT CAN MAKE OUR STORIES INTO LOVE STORIES AND OUR COLLECTIVE STORY INTO ONE THAT CONTINUALLY PERPETUATES HOPE
JessicaJackley_2010G AND GOOD THINGS FOR ALL OF US SO THAT THIS BELIEF IN EACH OTHER KNOWING THAT WITHOUT A DOUBT
JessicaJackley_2010G THAT EVERY DAY IN WHATEVER YOU DO THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD AND MAKE TOMORROW BETTER THAN TODAY
