JohnLloyd_2009G@18.42:20.06 QUESTION IS WHAT IS INVISIBLE
JohnLloyd_2009G@21.03:30.28 MORE OF IT THAN YOU THINK ACTUALLY EVERYTHING I WOULD SAY EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS EXCEPT EVERY THING AND EXCEPT MATTER
JohnLloyd_2009G@32.31:40.92 WE CAN SEE MATTER BUT WE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER AS IN THIS CRYPTIC SENTENCE I FOUND IN THE GUARDIAN RECENTLY
JohnLloyd_2009G@49.94:51.85 THERE'S A WORLD OF INVISIBILITY THERE
JohnLloyd_2009G@54.54:61.17 SO WE CAN SEE THE STARS AND THE PLANETS BUT WE CAN'T SEE WHAT HOLDS THEM APART OR WHAT DRAWS THEM TOGETHER
JohnLloyd_2009G@61.98:69.93 WITH MATTER AS WITH PEOPLE WE SEE ONLY THE SKIN OF THINGS WE CAN'T SEE INTO THE ENGINE ROOM WE CAN'T SEE WHAT MAKES PEOPLE TICK AT LEAST NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
JohnLloyd_2009G@70.11:77.51 THE CLOSER WE LOOK AT ANYTHING THE MORE IT DISAPPEARS IN FACT IF YOU LOOK REALLY CLOSELY AT STUFF IF YOU LOOK AT THE BASIC SUBSTRUCTURE OF
JohnLloyd_2009G@78.58:84.23 THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THERE ELECTRONS DISAPPEAR IN A KIND OF FUZZ AND THERE IS ONLY ENERGY AND YOU CAN'T SEE ENERGY
JohnLloyd_2009G@86.25:87.65 SO EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS
JohnLloyd_2009G@90.93:97.45 SLIGHTLY SILLY THING THAT'S INVISIBLE IS THIS STORY WHICH IS INVISIBLE TO YOU AND I'M NOW GOING TO MAKE IT VISIBLE TO YOU IN YOUR MINDS
JohnLloyd_2009G@98.54:100.89 IT'S ABOUT AN M P CALLED GEOFFREY DICKENS
JohnLloyd_2009G@101.83:110.79 THE LATE GEOFFREY DICKENS M P WAS ATTENDING A FETE IN HIS CONSTITUENCY WHEREVER HE WENT AT EVERY STALL HE STOPPED HE WAS CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY A DEVOTED SMILING WOMAN OF INDESCRIBABLE UGLINESS
JohnLloyd_2009G@136.51:145.81 SO HE WENT OUT AND BOUGHT A PLASTIC FRAME TO PUT THE PHOTOGRAPH IN AND ON THE PHOTOGRAPH HE WROTE WITH A FLOURISH TO HORSE FACE WITH LOVE FROM GEOFFREY DICKENS M P
JohnLloyd_2009G@146.87:153.65 SENT OFF HIS SECRETARY SAID TO HIM DID YOU GET THAT LETTER FROM THE WOMAN AT THE FETE I WROTE HORSE FACE ON HER SO YOU'D REMEMBER
JohnLloyd_2009G@160.69:162.27 HE THOUGHT HE WISHED HE WAS INVISIBLE
JohnLloyd_2009G@164.57:178.02 SO ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT INVISIBILITY IS THAT THINGS THAT WE CAN'T SEE WE ALSO CAN'T UNDERSTAND GRAVITY IS ONE THING THAT WE CAN'T SEE AND WHICH WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT'S THE LEAST UNDERSTOOD OF ALL THE FOUR FUNDAMENTAL FORCES AND THE WEAKEST
JohnLloyd_2009G@178.46:185.91 AND NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT IT IS OR WHY IT'S THERE FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH SIR ISSAC NEWTON THE GREATEST SCIENTIST WHO EVER LIVED HE THOUGHT JESUS CAME
JohnLloyd_2009G@196.62:204.46 I SEE ALL YOUR FACES I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ANY OF YOU ARE THINKING ISN'T THAT AMAZING ISN'T THAT INCREDIBLE THAT WE CAN'T READ EACH OTHER 'S MINDS BUT WE CAN TOUCH EACH OTHER
JohnLloyd_2009G@205.49:219.48 TASTE EACH OTHER PERHAPS IF WE GET CLOSE ENOUGH BUT WE CAN'T READ EACH OTHER 'S MINDS I FIND THAT QUITE ASTONISHING IN THE SUFI FAITH THIS GREAT MIDDLE EASTERN RELIGION WHICH SOME CLAIM IS THE ROUTE OF ALL RELIGIONS SUFI MASTERS ARE ALL TELEPATHS
JohnLloyd_2009G@220.05:228.17 SO THEY SAY BUT THEIR MAIN EXERCISE OF TELEPATHY IS TO SEND OUT POWERFUL SIGNALS TO THE REST OF US THAT IT DOESN'T EXIST
JohnLloyd_2009G@228.99:232.26 SO THAT'S WHY WE DON'T THINK IT EXISTS THE SUFI MASTERS WORKING ON US
JohnLloyd_2009G@254.40:266.31 THE LAWS OF PHYSICS INVISIBLE ETERNAL OMNIPRESENT ALL POWERFUL REMIND YOU OF ANYONE INTERESTING I 'M AS YOU CAN GUESS NOT A MATERIALIST I'M AN IMMATERIALIST AND I'VE FOUND A VERY USEFUL NEW
JohnLloyd_2009G@267.20:274.94 IGNOSTIC OKAY I'M AN IGNOSTIC I REFUSE TO BE DRAWN ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER GOD EXISTS UNTIL SOMEBODY PROPERLY DEFINES THE TERMS
JohnLloyd_2009G@278.30:280.64 ANOTHER THING WE CAN'T SEE IS THE HUMAN GENOME
JohnLloyd_2009G@281.20:288.89 AND THIS IS INCREASINGLY PECULIAR BECAUSE ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN THEY STARTED DELVING INTO THE GENOME
JohnLloyd_2009G@289.11:296.64 THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD PROBABLY CONTAIN AROUND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND GENES GENETICISTS WILL KNOW THIS BUT EVERY YEAR SINCE IT'S BEEN REVISED DOWNWARDS
JohnLloyd_2009G@296.92:307.48 WE NOW THINK THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE ONLY JUST OVER TWENTY THOUSAND GENES IN THE HUMAN GENOME THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE RICE GET THIS RICE IS KNOWN TO HAVE THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND GENES
JohnLloyd_2009G@313.36:316.88 YOU KNOW THAT TWO MORE THAN PEOPLE AND THE SAME A GORILLA
JohnLloyd_2009G@319.92:322.55 YOU CAN'T SEE THESE THINGS BUT THEY ARE VERY STRANGE
JohnLloyd_2009G@324.85:333.26 THE STARS BY DAY I ALWAYS THINK THAT'S FASCINATING THE UNIVERSE DISAPPEARS THE MORE LIGHT THERE IS THE LESS YOU CAN SEE TIME
JohnLloyd_2009G@360.27:371.81 ISN'T THAT EXTRAORDINARY YOU CAN NOT REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU EARLIER THAN THE AGE OF TWO OR THREE WHICH IS GREAT NEWS FOR PSYCHOANALYSTS BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY'D BE OUT OF A JOB BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE ALL THE STUFF HAPPENS
JohnLloyd_2009G@374.71:376.09 THAT MAKES YOU WHO YOU ARE
JohnLloyd_2009G@377.95:386.76 ANOTHER THING YOU CAN'T SEE IS THE GRID ON WHICH WE HANG THIS IS FASCINATING YOU PROBABLY KNOW SOME OF YOU THAT CELLS ARE CONTINUALLY RENEWED YOU CAN SEE IT IN SKIN AND THIS KIND OF STUFF
JohnLloyd_2009G@396.04:403.63 LIVERS AND INTERNAL ORGANS SORT OF TAKE A BIT LONGER A SPINE TAKES SEVERAL YEARS BUT AT THE END OF SEVEN YEARS NOT ONE CELL IN YOUR BODY
JohnLloyd_2009G@404.45:412.89 REMAINS FROM WHAT WAS THERE SEVEN YEARS AGO THE QUESTION IS WHO THEN ARE WE WHAT ARE WE WHAT IS THIS THING THAT WE HANG ON THAT IS ACTUALLY
JohnLloyd_2009G@429.65:440.25 SAID TO BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL EVER INVENTION OF A WORD BY A KNOWN INDIVIDUAL QUITE GOOD HE ALSO INVENTED A WORD CALLED BLASS MEANING ASTRAL RADIATION DIDN'T
JohnLloyd_2009G@446.69:448.38 IS SO MANY THINGS THAT
JohnLloyd_2009G@467.62:473.02 SEE THAT DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THEY UNDERSTAND ELECTRICITY THEY DON 'T NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT IS
JohnLloyd_2009G@473.70:485.25 YOU PROBABLY THINK THE ELECTRONS IN AN ELECTRIC WIRE MOVE INSTANTANEOUSLY DOWN A WIRE DON'T YOU AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT WHEN YOU TURN THE LIGHT ON THEY DON 'T ELECTRONS BUMBLE DOWN THE WIRE ABOUT THE SPEED OF SPREADING HONEY THEY SAY
JohnLloyd_2009G@488.57:492.62 HUNDRED BILLION OF THEM ESTIMATED IN THE UNIVERSE ONE HUNDRED BILLION HOW MANY CAN WE SEE
JohnLloyd_2009G@520.56:527.37 AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DO RADIO THAT'S WHAT THEY DISCOVERED ANYWAY SO THE BIGGEST THING
JohnLloyd_2009G@537.28:540.80 ABOUT ANYTHING AND I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION
JohnLloyd_2009G@551.55:563.18 YOU CAN'T SEE A POINT IT 'S BY DEFINITION DIMENSIONLESS LIKE AN ELECTRON ODDLY ENOUGH BUT THE POINT WHAT I'VE GOT IT DOWN TO IS THERE ARE ONLY TWO QUESTIONS REALLY WORTH ASKING WHY ARE WE
JohnLloyd_2009G@564.27:566.27 AND WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT IT WHILE WE ARE
JohnLloyd_2009G@567.50:568.09 AND
