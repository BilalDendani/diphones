DavidKelley_2012 I 'M GOING TO START WAY BACK IN THE THIRD GRADE AT OAKDALE SCHOOL IN BARBERTON OHIO I REMEMBER ONE DAY MY BEST FRIEND BRIAN WAS WORKING ON A PROJECT
DavidKelley_2012 HE WAS MAKING A HORSE OUT OF THE CLAY THAT OUR TEACHER KEPT UNDER THE SINK
DavidKelley_2012 AND AT ONE POINT ONE OF THE GIRLS WHO WAS SITTING AT HIS TABLE
DavidKelley_2012 SEEING WHAT HE WAS DOING LEANED OVER AND SAID TO HIM THAT 'S TERRIBLE THAT DOESN 'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE A HORSE
DavidKelley_2012 AND BRIAN 'S SHOULDERS SANK AND HE WADDED UP THE CLAY HORSE AND HE THREW IT BACK IN THE BIN
DavidKelley_2012 IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN I TELL THAT STORY OF BRIAN TO MY CLASS
DavidKelley_2012 AND I SEE THAT OPTING OUT THAT HAPPENS IN CHILDHOOD AND IT MOVES IN AND BECOMES MORE INGRAINED EVEN BY THE TIME YOU GET TO ADULT LIFE
DavidKelley_2012 SO
DavidKelley_2012 FUZZY OR UNCONVENTIONAL
DavidKelley_2012 AND EVENTUALLY THESE BIGSHOT EXECUTIVES WHIP OUT THEIR BLACKBERRIES AND THEY SAY THEY HAVE TO MAKE REALLY IMPORTANT PHONE CALLS AND THEY HEAD FOR THE EXITS
DavidKelley_2012 AND THEY 'RE JUST SO UNCOMFORTABLE
DavidKelley_2012 WHEN WE TRACK THEM DOWN AND ASK THEM WHAT 'S GOING ON THEY SAY SOMETHING LIKE I 'M JUST NOT THE CREATIVE TYPE
DavidKelley_2012 IF THEY STICK WITH THE PROCESS IF THEY STICK WITH IT THEY END UP DOING AMAZING THINGS AND THEY SURPRISE THEMSELVES JUST HOW INNOVATIVE THEY AND THEIR TEAMS REALLY ARE
DavidKelley_2012 SO I 'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS FEAR OF JUDGMENT THAT WE HAVE THAT YOU DON 'T DO THINGS YOU 'RE AFRAID YOU 'RE GOING TO BE JUDGED IF YOU DON 'T SAY THE RIGHT CREATIVE THING YOU 'RE GOING TO BE JUDGED AND I HAD A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH WHEN I MET THE PSYCHOLOGIST ALBERT BANDURA
DavidKelley_2012 FREUD SKINNER SOMEBODY AND BANDURA
DavidKelley_2012 AND SO I WENT TO SEE HIM BECAUSE HE HAS JUST WORKED ON PHOBIAS FOR A LONG TIME WHICH I 'M VERY INTERESTED IN HE HAD DEVELOPED THIS
DavidKelley_2012 METHODOLOGY THAT ENDED UP CURING PEOPLE IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME IN FOUR HOURS HE HAD A HUGE CURE RATE OF PEOPLE WHO HAD PHOBIAS AND WE TALKED ABOUT SNAKES I DON 'T KNOW WHY WE TALKED ABOUT SNAKES WE TALKED ABOUT SNAKES AND FEAR OF SNAKES AS A PHOBIA
DavidKelley_2012 AND IT WAS REALLY ENJOYABLE REALLY INTERESTING
DavidKelley_2012 HE TOLD ME THAT HE 'D INVITE THE TEST SUBJECT IN AND HE 'D SAY YOU KNOW THERE 'S A SNAKE IN THE NEXT ROOM AND WE 'RE GOING TO GO IN THERE
DavidKelley_2012 AND HE 'D GET THEM COMFORTABLE WITH THAT AND THEN THROUGH A SERIES OF STEPS
DavidKelley_2012 HE 'D MOVE THEM AND THEY 'D BE STANDING IN THE DOORWAY WITH THE DOOR OPEN AND THEY 'D BE LOOKING IN THERE AND HE 'D GET THEM COMFORTABLE WITH THAT AND THEN MANY MORE STEPS LATER BABY STEPS THEY 'D BE IN THE ROOM THEY 'D HAVE A LEATHER GLOVE LIKE A WELDER 'S GLOVE ON
DavidKelley_2012 AND THEY 'D EVENTUALLY TOUCH THE SNAKE
DavidKelley_2012 AND WHEN THEY TOUCHED THE SNAKE
DavidKelley_2012 EVERYTHING WAS FINE THEY WERE CURED IN FACT EVERYTHING WAS BETTER THAN FINE
DavidKelley_2012 THESE PEOPLE WHO HAD LIFE LONG FEARS OF SNAKES
DavidKelley_2012 WERE SAYING THINGS LIKE
DavidKelley_2012 BANDURA CALLS THIS PROCESS GUIDED MASTERY
DavidKelley_2012 I LOVE THAT TERM GUIDED MASTERY AND SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED
DavidKelley_2012 THESE PEOPLE WHO WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS AND TOUCHED THE SNAKE ENDED UP HAVING LESS ANXIETY ABOUT OTHER THINGS IN THEIR LIVES
DavidKelley_2012 THEY TRIED HARDER THEY PERSEVERED LONGER AND THEY WERE MORE RESILIENT IN THE FACE OF FAILURE
DavidKelley_2012 THEY JUST GAINED A NEW CONFIDENCE
DavidKelley_2012 AND BANDURA CALLS THAT CONFIDENCE
DavidKelley_2012 SELF EFFICACY THE SENSE THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE WORLD
DavidKelley_2012 AND THAT YOU CAN ATTAIN WHAT YOU SET OUT TO DO
DavidKelley_2012 WELL MEETING BANDURA WAS REALLY CATHARTIC FOR ME BECAUSE I REALIZED THAT THIS FAMOUS SCIENTIST HAD DOCUMENTED AND SCIENTIFICALLY VALIDATED SOMETHING THAT WE 'VE SEEN HAPPEN FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS THAT WE COULD TAKE PEOPLE WHO HAD THE FEAR THAT THEY WEREN 'T CREATIVE AND WE COULD TAKE THEM THROUGH A SERIES OF STEPS
DavidKelley_2012 KIND OF LIKE A SERIES OF SMALL SUCCESSES AND THEY TURN FEAR INTO FAMILIARITY
DavidKelley_2012 AND THEY SURPRISE THEMSELVES THAT TRANSFORMATION IS AMAZING WE SEE IT AT THE D SCHOOL ALL THE TIME PEOPLE FROM ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF DISCIPLINES
DavidKelley_2012 THEY THINK OF THEMSELVES AS ONLY ANALYTICAL AND THEY COME IN AND THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OUR PROCESS THEY BUILD CONFIDENCE AND NOW THEY THINK OF THEMSELVES DIFFERENTLY AND THEY 'RE TOTALLY EMOTIONALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY WALK AROUND THINKING OF THEMSELVES AS A CREATIVE PERSON
DavidKelley_2012 SO I THOUGHT ONE OF THE THINGS I 'D DO TODAY IS TAKE YOU THROUGH AND SHOW YOU WHAT THIS JOURNEY LOOKS LIKE
DavidKelley_2012 TO ME THAT JOURNEY LOOKS LIKE
DavidKelley_2012 DOUG DIETZ
DavidKelley_2012 DOUG DIETZ IS A TECHNICAL PERSON HE DESIGNS MEDICAL IMAGING EQUIPMENT LARGE MEDICAL IMAGING EQUIPMENT HE 'S WORKED FOR GE AND HE 'S HAD A FANTASTIC CAREER BUT AT ONE POINT HE HAD A MOMENT OF CRISIS
DavidKelley_2012 HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL LOOKING AT ONE OF HIS MRI MACHINES IN USE
DavidKelley_2012 WHEN HE SAW A YOUNG FAMILY
DavidKelley_2012 THAT NEARLY EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PEDIATRIC PATIENTS IN THIS HOSPITAL HAD TO BE SEDATED IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH HIS MRI MACHINE
DavidKelley_2012 AND THIS WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTING TO DOUG BECAUSE BEFORE THIS TIME HE WAS PROUD OF WHAT HE DID HE WAS SAVING LIVES WITH THIS MACHINE BUT IT REALLY HURT HIM TO SEE THE FEAR THAT THIS MACHINE CAUSED IN KIDS ABOUT THAT TIME HE WAS AT THE D SCHOOL AT STANFORD TAKING CLASSES
DavidKelley_2012 HE WAS LEARNING ABOUT OUR PROCESS ABOUT DESIGN THINKING ABOUT EMPATHY
DavidKelley_2012 ABOUT ITERATIVE PROTOTYPING AND HE WOULD TAKE THIS NEW KNOWLEDGE AND DO SOMETHING QUITE EXTRAORDINARY HE WOULD REDESIGN
DavidKelley_2012 THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE OF BEING SCANNED
DavidKelley_2012 AND THIS IS WHAT HE CAME UP WITH
DavidKelley_2012 HE TURNED IT INTO AN ADVENTURE FOR THE KIDS HE PAINTED THE WALLS AND HE PAINTED THE MACHINE AND HE GOT THE OPERATORS RETRAINED BY PEOPLE WHO KNOW KIDS LIKE CHILDREN 'S MUSEUM PEOPLE AND NOW WHEN THE KID COMES
DavidKelley_2012 IT 'S AN EXPERIENCE AND THEY TALK TO THEM ABOUT THE NOISE AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE SHIP
DavidKelley_2012 AND WHEN THEY COME THEY SAY OKAY YOU 'RE GOING TO GO INTO THE PIRATE SHIP BUT BE VERY STILL BECAUSE WE DON 'T WANT THE PIRATES TO FIND YOU
DavidKelley_2012 AND THE RESULTS WERE SUPER DRAMATIC SO FROM SOMETHING LIKE EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE KIDS NEEDING TO BE SEDATED TO SOMETHING LIKE TEN PERCENT OF THE KIDS NEEDING TO BE SEDATED
DavidKelley_2012 AND THE HOSPITAL AND GE WERE HAPPY TOO BECAUSE YOU DIDN 'T HAVE TO CALL THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST ALL THE TIME THEY COULD PUT MORE KIDS THROUGH THE MACHINE IN A DAY SO THE QUANTITATIVE RESULTS WERE GREAT
DavidKelley_2012 BUT DOUG 'S RESULTS THAT HE CARED ABOUT WERE MUCH MORE QUALITATIVE
DavidKelley_2012 HE WAS WITH ONE OF THE MOTHERS WAITING FOR HER CHILD TO COME OUT OF THE SCAN AND WHEN THE LITTLE GIRL CAME OUT OF HER SCAN SHE RAN UP TO HER MOTHER AND SAID
DavidKelley_2012 MOMMY CAN WE COME BACK TOMORROW
DavidKelley_2012 DOUG 'S STORY TAKES PLACE IN A HOSPITAL
DavidKelley_2012 I KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT HOSPITALS
DavidKelley_2012 A FEW YEARS AGO I FELT A LUMP ON THE SIDE OF MY NECK
DavidKelley_2012 IT WAS CANCER IT WAS THE BAD KIND I WAS TOLD I HAD A FORTY PERCENT CHANCE OF SURVIVAL
DavidKelley_2012 SO WHILE YOU 'RE SITTING AROUND WITH THE OTHER PATIENTS IN YOUR PAJAMAS AND EVERYBODY 'S PALE AND THIN AND YOU 'RE WAITING FOR YOUR TURN TO GET THE GAMMA RAYS
DavidKelley_2012 YOU THINK OF A LOT OF THINGS MOSTLY YOU THINK ABOUT AM I GOING TO SURVIVE
DavidKelley_2012 AND I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT WHAT WAS MY DAUGHTER 'S LIFE GOING TO BE LIKE WITHOUT ME
DavidKelley_2012 BUT
DavidKelley_2012 BUT I DECIDED AND I COMMITTED TO AT THIS POINT TO THE THING I MOST WANTED TO DO
DavidKelley_2012 WAS TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE
DavidKelley_2012 COME UP WITH MORE INTERESTING AND JUST MORE IDEAS SO THEY CAN CHOOSE FROM BETTER IDEAS AND THEY JUST MAKE BETTER DECISIONS SO I KNOW AT TED YOU 'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CHANGE THE WORLD KIND OF THING EVERYBODY HAS A CHANGE THE WORLD THING IF THERE IS ONE FOR ME THIS IS IT TO HELP THIS HAPPEN
DavidKelley_2012 SO I HOPE YOU 'LL JOIN ME ON MY QUEST
DavidKelley_2012 AND TO HAVE PEOPLE REALIZE THAT THEY 'RE NATURALLY CREATIVE
