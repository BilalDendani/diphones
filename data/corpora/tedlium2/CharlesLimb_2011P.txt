CharlesLimb_2011P WHEN WE THINK OF OUR SENSES
CharlesLimb_2011P WE DON 'T USUALLY THINK OF THE REASONS WHY THEY PROBABLY EVOLVED FROM A BIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE WE DON 'T REALLY THINK OF THE EVOLUTIONARY NEED TO BE PROTECTED BY OUR SENSES BUT THAT 'S PROBABLY WHY OUR SENSES REALLY EVOLVED TO KEEP US SAFE TO ALLOW US TO LIVE REALLY WHEN WE THINK OF OUR SENSES OR WHEN WE THINK OF THE LOSS OF THE SENSE
CharlesLimb_2011P WE REALLY THINK ABOUT SOMETHING MORE LIKE THIS THE ABILITY TO TOUCH SOMETHING LUXURIOUS TO TASTE SOMETHING DELICIOUS TO SMELL SOMETHING FRAGRANT TO SEE SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL THIS IS WHAT WE WANT OUT OF OUR SENSES WE WANT BEAUTY WE DON 'T JUST WANT FUNCTION
CharlesLimb_2011P AND WHEN IT COMES TO SENSORY RESTORATION WE 'RE STILL VERY FAR AWAY FROM BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE BEAUTY AND THAT 'S WHAT I 'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TODAY LIKEWISE FOR HEARING WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHY WE HEAR WE DON 'T OFTEN THINK ABOUT THE ABILITY TO HEAR AN ALARM OR A SIREN ALTHOUGH CLEARLY THAT 'S AN IMPORTANT THING
CharlesLimb_2011P REALLY WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR IS MUSIC
CharlesLimb_2011P I 'D LIKE TO IMPRESS UPON YOU HOW UNUSUAL IT IS THAT WE CAN HEAR MUSIC MUSIC IS JUST ONE OF THE STRANGEST THINGS THAT THERE IS
CharlesLimb_2011P IT 'S ACOUSTIC VIBRATIONS IN THE AIR LITTLE WAVES OF ENERGY IN THE AIR THAT TICKLE OUR EARDRUM SOMEHOW IN TICKLING OUR EARDRUM THAT TRANSMITS ENERGY DOWN OUR HEARING BONES WHICH GET CONVERTED TO A FLUID IMPULSE INSIDE THE COCHLEA AND THEN SOMEHOW CONVERTED INTO AN ELECTRICAL SIGNAL IN OUR AUDITORY NERVES THAT SOMEHOW WIND UP IN OUR BRAINS
CharlesLimb_2011P AS A PERCEPTION OF A SONG OR A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF MUSIC THAT PROCESS IS ENTIRELY ABSTRACT AND VERY VERY UNUSUAL AND WE COULD DISCUSS THAT TOPIC ALONE FOR DAYS TO REALLY TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW IS IT THAT WE HEAR SOMETHING THAT 'S EMOTIONAL FROM SOMETHING THAT STARTS OUT AS A VIBRATION IN THE AIR
CharlesLimb_2011P TURNS OUT THAT IF YOU HAVE HEARING LOSS MOST PEOPLE THAT LOSE THEIR HEARING LOSE IT AT WHAT 'S CALLED THE COCHLEA THE INNER EAR
CharlesLimb_2011P AND IT 'S AT THE HAIR CELL LEVEL THAT THEY DO THIS
CharlesLimb_2011P NOW IF YOU HAD TO PICK A SENSE TO LOSE I HAVE TO BE VERY HONEST WITH YOU AND SAY WE 'RE BETTER AT RESTORING HEARING THAN WE ARE AT RESTORING ANY SENSE THAT THERE IS
CharlesLimb_2011P IN FACT NOTHING EVEN ACTUALLY COMES CLOSE TO OUR ABILITY TO RESTORE HEARING AND AS A PHYSICIAN AND A SURGEON I CAN CONFIDENTLY TELL MY PATIENTS THAT IF YOU HAD TO PICK A SENSE TO LOSE WE ARE THE FURTHEST ALONG MEDICALLY AND SURGICALLY WITH HEARING AS A MUSICIAN
CharlesLimb_2011P THERE IS A LIMITATION TO WHAT A CHILD WHO 'S DEAF AN INFANT WHO WAS BORN DEAF HAS IN THIS WORLD IN TERMS OF SOCIAL EDUCATIONAL VOCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES I 'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY CAN 'T LIVE A BEAUTIFUL WONDERFUL LIFE I 'M SAYING THAT THEY 'RE GOING TO FACE OBSTACLES THAT MOST PEOPLE WHO HAVE NORMAL HEARING WILL NOT HAVE TO FACE
CharlesLimb_2011P NOW HEARING LOSS AND THE TREATMENT FOR HEARING LOSS HAS REALLY EVOLVED IN THE PAST TWO HUNDRED YEARS I MEAN LITERALLY THEY USED TO DO THINGS LIKE STICK EAR SHAPED OBJECTS ONTO YOUR EARS AND STICK FUNNELS IN AND THAT WAS THE BEST YOU COULD DO FOR HEARING LOSS
CharlesLimb_2011P BACK THEN YOU COULDN 'T EVEN LOOK AT THE EARDRUM SO IT 'S NOT TOO SURPRISING THAT THERE WERE NO GOOD TREATMENTS FOR HEARING LOSS AND NOW TODAY WE HAVE THE MODERN MULTI CHANNEL COCHLEAR IMPLANT WHICH IS AN OUTPATIENT PROCEDURE IT 'S SURGICALLY PLACED INSIDE THE INNER EAR IT TAKES ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF TO TWO HOURS DEPENDING ON WHERE IT 'S DONE UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA AND IN THE END YOU ACHIEVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
CharlesLimb_2011P WHERE AN ELECTRODE ARRAY IS INSERTED INSIDE THE COCHLEA NOW ACTUALLY THIS IS QUITE CRUDE IN COMPARISON TO OUR REGULAR INNER EAR BUT HERE IS THAT SAME GIRL WHO IS IMPLANTED NOW THIS IS HER TEN YEARS LATER AND THIS IS A VIDEO THAT WAS TAKEN BY MY SURGICAL MENTOR DR JOHN NIPARKO WHO IMPLANTED HER IF WE COULD PLAY THIS VIDEO PLEASE
CharlesLimb_2011P DO YOU REMEMBER WRITING THAT CHAPTER
CharlesLimb_2011P YOU TURN ON THE RADIO AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY CAN 'T HEAR MUSIC ALMOST AT ALL IN FACT MOST IMPLANT USERS REALLY STRUGGLE AND DISLIKE MUSIC BECAUSE IT SOUNDS SO BAD
CharlesLimb_2011P AND SO WHEN IT COMES TO THIS IDEA OF RESTORING BEAUTY TO SOMEBODY 'S LIFE WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO WHEN IT COMES TO AUDITION
CharlesLimb_2011P NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS FOR THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER THE FACT THAT MUSIC IS A DIFFERENT CAPACITY BECAUSE IT 'S ABSTRACT LANGUAGE IS VERY DIFFERENT LANGUAGE IS VERY PRECISE IN FACT THE WHOLE REASON WE USE IT IS BECAUSE IT HAS SEMANTIC SPECIFICITY
CharlesLimb_2011P WHEN YOU SAY A WORD WHAT YOU CARE IS THAT WORD WAS PERCEIVED CORRECTLY YOU DON 'T CARE THAT THE WORD SOUNDED PRETTY WHEN IT WAS SPOKEN MUSIC IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WHEN YOU HEAR MUSIC IF IT DOESN 'T SOUND GOOD WHAT 'S THE POINT THERE 'S REALLY VERY LITTLE POINT IN LISTENING TO MUSIC WHEN IT DOESN 'T SOUND GOOD TO YOU
CharlesLimb_2011P THE ACOUSTICS OF MUSIC ARE MUCH HARDER THAN THOSE OF LANGUAGE AND YOU CAN SEE ON THIS
CharlesLimb_2011P FIGURE THAT THE FREQUENCY RANGE AND THE DECIBEL RANGE THE DYNAMIC RANGE OF MUSIC IS FAR MORE HETEROGENEOUS
CharlesLimb_2011P SO IF WE HAD TO DESIGN A PERFECT COCHLEAR IMPLANT WHAT WE WOULD TRY TO DO IS TARGET IT TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW MUSIC TRANSMISSION
CharlesLimb_2011P BECAUSE I ALWAYS VIEW MUSIC AS THE PINNACLE OF HEARING IF YOU CAN HEAR MUSIC YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO HEAR ANYTHING NOW THE PROBLEMS BEGIN FIRST WITH PITCH PERCEPTION I MEAN MOST OF US KNOW THAT PITCH IS A FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCK OF MUSIC AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO PERCEIVE PITCH WELL
CharlesLimb_2011P MUSIC AND MELODY IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO FORGET ABOUT A HARMONY AND THINGS LIKE THAT NOW THIS IS A MIDI ARRANGEMENT OF RACHMANINOFF 'S PRELUDE NOW IF WE COULD JUST PLAY THIS
CharlesLimb_2011P THE SOUND QUALITY OR THE SOUND OF THE SOUND IS HOW I LIKE TO DESCRIBE TIMBRE TONE COLOR THEY CANNOT TELL THESE THINGS WHATSOEVER THIS IMPLANT IS NOT TRANSMITTING THE QUALITY OF MUSIC THAT USUALLY PROVIDES THINGS LIKE WARMTH
CharlesLimb_2011P NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE BRAIN OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS A COCHLEAR IMPLANT AND YOU HAVE THEM LISTEN TO SPEECH HAVE THEM LISTEN TO RHYTHM AND HAVE THEM LISTEN TO MELODY WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THE AUDITORY CORTEX IS THE MOST ACTIVE DURING SPEECH YOU WOULD THINK THAT BECAUSE THESE IMPLANTS ARE OPTIMIZED FOR SPEECH THEY WERE DESIGNED FOR SPEECH
CharlesLimb_2011P BUT ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT MELODY WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THERE 'S VERY LITTLE CORTICAL ACTIVITY IN IMPLANT USERS COMPARED WITH NORMAL HEARING CONTROLS
CharlesLimb_2011P SO FOR WHATEVER REASON THIS IMPLANT IS NOT SUCCESSFULLY STIMULATING AUDITORY CORTICES DURING MELODY PERCEPTION
CharlesLimb_2011P I HAD PATIENTS TELL ME THAT THOSE SOUND THE SAME THEY CANNOT DIFFERENTIATE SOUND QUALITY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE TWO CLIPS AGAIN WE ARE VERY VERY FAR AWAY IN JUST GETTING TO WHERE WE WANT TO GET TO NOW THE QUESTION COMES TO MIND IS THERE ANY HOPE
CharlesLimb_2011P AND YES THERE IS HOPE NOW I DON 'T KNOW IF ANYBODY KNOWS WHO THIS IS THIS IS DOES SOMEBODY KNOW THIS IS BEETHOVEN
CharlesLimb_2011P AND IT TURNS OUT THAT HIS TEMPORAL BONES WERE HARVESTED WHEN HE DIED TO TRY TO LOOK AT THE CAUSE OF HIS DEAFNESS WHICH IS WHY HE HAS MOLDING CLAY AND HIS SKULL IS BULGING OUT ON THE SIDE THERE BUT BEETHOVEN COMPOSED MUSIC LONG AFTER HE LOST HIS HEARING WHAT THAT SUGGESTS IS THAT EVEN IN THE CASE OF HEARING LOSS
CharlesLimb_2011P THE CAPACITY FOR MUSIC REMAINS THE BRAINS REMAIN HARDWIRED FOR MUSIC I 'VE BEEN VERY LUCKY TO WORK WITH DR DAVID RYUGO WHERE I 'VE BEEN WORKING ON DEAF CATS THAT ARE WHITE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE GIVE THEM COCHLEAR IMPLANTS THIS IS A CAT THAT 'S BEEN TRAINED TO RESPOND TO A TRUMPET FOR FOOD
CharlesLimb_2011P IF WE WERE TO DIRECT EFFORTS TOWARDS TRAINING COCHLEAR IMPLANT USERS TO HEAR MUSIC BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE 'S VIRTUALLY NO EFFORT PUT TOWARDS THAT NO REHABILITATIVE STRATEGIES
CharlesLimb_2011P VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE MUSIC WE WOULD COME A LONG WAY
CharlesLimb_2011P AND HE LEARNED TO PLAY THE PIANO AFTER HE RECEIVED THE COCHLEAR IMPLANT AND HERE 'S A VIDEO OF JOSEPH
CharlesLimb_2011P AND
CharlesLimb_2011P AND IT 'S ONE OF THE MOST AWFUL THINGS HEARTWARMING BUT AWFUL
CharlesLimb_2011P WHEN IT COMES TO RESTORATION OF HEARING WE HAVE CERTAINLY COME A LONG WAY A REMARKABLY LONG WAY
CharlesLimb_2011P AND WE HAVE A MUCH LONGER WAY TO GO WHEN IT COMES TO THE IDEA OF RESTORING PERFECT HEARING AND LET ME TELL YOU RIGHT NOW IT 'S FINE THAT WE WOULD ALL BE VERY HAPPY WITH SPEECH BUT I TELL YOU IF WE LOST OUR HEARING IF ANYONE HERE SUDDENLY LOST YOUR HEARING YOU WOULD WANT PERFECT HEARING BACK YOU WOULDN 'T WANT DECENT HEARING YOU WOULD WANT PERFECT HEARING
CharlesLimb_2011P RESTORATION OF BASIC SENSORY FUNCTION IS CRITICAL AND I DON 'T MEAN TO UNDERSTATE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO RESTORE BASIC FUNCTION BUT IT 'S REALLY RESTORATION OF THE ABILITY TO PERCEIVE BEAUTY
