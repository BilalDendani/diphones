AaronHuey_2010X I'M HERE TODAY TO SHOW MY PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE LAKOTA MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF THE LAKOTA OR AT LEAST THE LARGER GROUP OF TRIBES CALLED
AaronHuey_2010X THE LAKOTA ARE ONE OF MANY TRIBES THAT WERE MOVED OFF THEIR LAND TO PRISONER OF WAR CAMPS NOW CALLED RESERVATIONS THE PINE RIDGE RESERVATION
AaronHuey_2010X NOW IF ANY OF YOU HAVE EVER HEARD OF AIM THE AMERICAN INDIAN MOVEMENT OR OF RUSSELL MEANS OR LEONARD PELTIER OR OF THE STAND OFF AT OGLALA
AaronHuey_2010X AND INVITED ME AGAIN AND AGAIN OVER FIVE YEARS BUT ON PINE RIDGE I WILL ALWAYS BE WHAT IS CALLED WASICHU AND WASICHU IS A LAKOTA WORD
AaronHuey_2010X THAT MEANS NON INDIAN BUT ANOTHER VERSION OF THIS WORD MEANS THE ONE WHO TAKES THE BEST MEAT FOR HIMSELF AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE ONE WHO TAKES THE BEST PART OF THE MEAT IT MEANS GREEDY
AaronHuey_2010X WE HAVE INDEED TAKEN THE BEST PART OF THE MEAT SO LET 'S LOOK TODAY AT A SET OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF A PEOPLE WHO LOST SO THAT WE COULD GAIN
AaronHuey_2010X AND KNOW THAT WHEN YOU SEE THESE PEOPLE 'S FACES THAT THESE ARE NOT JUST IMAGES OF THE LAKOTA THEY STAND FOR ALL INDIGENOUS PEOPLE
AaronHuey_2010X ON THIS PIECE OF PAPER IS THE HISTORY THE WAY I LEARNED IT FROM MY LAKOTA FRIENDS AND FAMILY
AaronHuey_2010X SIXTY SIX THE BEGINNING OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD A NEW ERA
AaronHuey_2010X WE APPROPRIATED LAND FOR TRAILS AND TRAINS TO SHORTCUT THROUGH THE HEART OF THE LAKOTA NATION THE TREATIES WERE OUT THE WINDOW IN RESPONSE THREE TRIBES LED BY THE LAKOTA CHIEF RED CLOUD
AaronHuey_2010X ATTACKED AND DEFEATED THE U S ARMY MANY TIMES OVER I WANT TO REPEAT THAT PART THE LAKOTA DEFEAT THE U S ARMY
AaronHuey_2010X SIXTY EIGHT THE SECOND FORT LARAMIE TREATY CLEARLY GUARANTEES THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE GREAT SIOUX NATION AND THE LAKOTAS OWNERSHIP OF THE SACRED BLACK HILLS
AaronHuey_2010X SEVENTY ONE THE INDIAN APPROPRIATION ACT MAKES ALL INDIANS WARDS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN ADDITION THE MILITARY ISSUED ORDERS FORBIDDING WESTERN INDIANS FROM LEAVING RESERVATIONS
AaronHuey_2010X THE MOVE DESTROYED THE RESERVATIONS MAKING IT EASIER TO FURTHER SUBDIVIDE AND TO SELL WITH EVERY PASSING GENERATION MOST OF THE SURPLUS LAND
AaronHuey_2010X I BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT IN THIS SLIDE SHOW THIS IS THE YEAR OF THE WOUNDED KNEE MASSACRE
AaronHuey_2010X TO THIS DAY THIS IS THE MOST MEDALS OF HONOR EVER AWARDED FOR A SINGLE BATTLE
AaronHuey_2010X MORE MEDALS OF HONOR WERE GIVEN FOR THE INDISCRIMINATE SLAUGHTER OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN THAN FOR ANY BATTLE IN WORLD WAR ONE WORLD WAR TWO KOREA VIETNAM IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN
AaronHuey_2010X THE WOUNDED KNEE MASSACRE IS CONSIDERED THE END OF THE INDIAN WARS WHENEVER I VISIT THE SITE OF THE MASS GRAVE AT WOUNDED KNEE
AaronHuey_2010X I SEE IT NOT JUST A GRAVE FOR THE LAKOTA OR FOR THE SIOUX BUT AS A GRAVE FOR ALL INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
AaronHuey_2010X THE HOLY MAN BLACK ELK SAID I DID NOT KNOW THEN HOW MUCH WAS ENDED WHEN I LOOK BACK NOW FROM THIS HIGH HILL OF MY OLD AGE
AaronHuey_2010X I CAN STILL SEE THE BUTCHERED WOMEN AND CHILDREN LYING HEAPED AND SCATTERED ALL ALONG THE CROOKED GULCH
AaronHuey_2010X WHEN I SAW THEM WITH EYES STILL YOUNG
AaronHuey_2010X AND I CAN SEE THAT SOMETHING ELSE DIED THERE IN THE BLOODY MUD AND WAS BURIED IN THE BLIZZARD
AaronHuey_2010X A PEOPLE 'S DREAM DIED THERE AND IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DREAM WITH
AaronHuey_2010X THIS EVENT A NEW ERA IN NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY BEGAN EVERYTHING CAN BE MEASURED BEFORE WOUNDED KNEE AND AFTER BECAUSE IT WAS IN THIS MOMENT WITH THE FINGERS ON THE TRIGGERS OF THE HOTCHKISS GUNS
AaronHuey_2010X THE COURT DETERMINED THAT WHEN THE SIOUX WERE RESETTLED ONTO RESERVATIONS AND SEVEN MILLION ACRES OF THEIR LAND WERE OPENED UP TO PROSPECTORS AND HOMESTEADERS THE TERMS OF THE SECOND FORT LARAMIE TREATY HAD BEEN VIOLATED
AaronHuey_2010X THE COURT STATED THAT THE BLACK HILLS WERE ILLEGALLY TAKEN AND THAT THE INITIAL OFFERING PRICE PLUS INTEREST SHOULD BE PAID TO THE SIOUX NATION
AaronHuey_2010X TEN STATISTICS ABOUT NATIVE POPULATION TODAY MORE THAN A CENTURY AFTER THE MASSACRE AT WOUNDED KNEE REVEAL THE LEGACY OF COLONIZATION FORCED MIGRATION AND TREATY VIOLATIONS
AaronHuey_2010X AT LEAST SIXTY PERCENT OF THE HOMES ON THE RESERVATION ARE INFESTED WITH BLACK MOLD MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION LIVES BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE
AaronHuey_2010X THE TUBERCULOSIS RATE ON PINE RIDGE IS APPROXIMATELY EIGHT TIMES HIGHER THAN THE U S NATIONAL AVERAGE THE INFANT MORTALITY RATE IS THE HIGHEST ON THIS CONTINENT AND IS ABOUT THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE U S NATIONAL AVERAGE
AaronHuey_2010X THE LAST CHAPTER IN ANY SUCCESSFUL GENOCIDE IS THE ONE IN WHICH THE OPPRESSOR CAN REMOVE THEIR HANDS AND SAY
AaronHuey_2010X MY GOD WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE DOING TO THEMSELVES THEY'RE KILLING EACH OTHER THEY'RE KILLING THEMSELVES WHILE WE WATCH THEM DIE
AaronHuey_2010X THIS IS HOW WE CAME TO OWN THESE UNITED STATES THIS IS THE LEGACY OF MANIFEST DESTINY PRISONERS ARE STILL BORN INTO PRISONER OF WAR CAMPS LONG AFTER THE GUARDS ARE GONE
AaronHuey_2010X THESE ARE THE BONES LEFT AFTER THE BEST MEAT HAS BEEN HAS BEEN TAKEN
AaronHuey_2010X A LONG TIME AGO A SERIES OF EVENTS WAS SET IN MOTION BY A PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME BY WASICHU EAGER TO TAKE THE LAND AND THE WATER AND THE GOLD IN THE HILLS
AaronHuey_2010X THOSE EVENTS LED TO A DOMINO EFFECT THAT HAS YET TO END AS REMOVED AS WE THE DOMINANT SOCIETY MAY FEEL
AaronHuey_2010X WHAT IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THESE IMAGES OF SUFFERING AND THE HISTORY THAT I JUST READ TO YOU AND HOW MUCH OF THIS HISTORY DO YOU NEED TO OWN EVEN IS ANY OF THIS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TODAY
AaronHuey_2010X BEEN TOLD THAT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WE CAN DO THERE MUST BE SOME CALL TO ACTION BECAUSE FOR SO LONG I'VE BEEN STANDING ON THE SIDELINES
AaronHuey_2010X CONTENT TO BE A WITNESS JUST TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS BECAUSE THE SOLUTION SEEMS SO FAR IN THE PAST I NEEDED NOTHING SHORT OF A TIME MACHINE TO ACCESS THEM
AaronHuey_2010X THE SUFFERING OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IS NOT A SIMPLE ISSUE TO FIX IT'S NOT SOMETHING EVERYONE CAN GET BEHIND THE WAY THEY GET BEHIND HELPING HAITI OF ENDING AIDS OR FIGHTING A FAMINE
AaronHuey_2010X THE FIX AS IT'S CALLED MAY BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE DOMINANT SOCIETY THAN SAY A FIFTY DOLLAR CHECK
AaronHuey_2010X OR CHURCH TRIP TO PAINT SOME GRAFFITI COVERED HOUSES OR A SUBURBAN FAMILY DONATING A BOX OF CLOTHES THEY DON'T EVEN WANT ANYMORE
AaronHuey_2010X SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US SHRUGGING OUR SHOULDERS IN THE DARK
AaronHuey_2010X THE CALL TO ACTION I OFFER TODAY MY TED WISH IS THIS HONOR THE TREATIES GIVE BACK THE BLACK HILLS IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS WHAT THEY DO WITH THEM
