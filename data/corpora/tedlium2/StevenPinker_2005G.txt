StevenPinker_2005G@13.13:20.86 THIS IS A PICTURE OF MAURICE DOCTORUON THE HONORARY PERPETUAL SECRETARY OF L 'ACADEMIE FRANCAISE THE FRENCH ACADEMY
StevenPinker_2005G@21.35:30.22 HE IS SPLENDIDLY ATTIRED IN HIS SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLAR UNIFORM BEFITTING THE ROLE OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY AS LEGISLATING
StevenPinker_2005G@30.90:39.19 THE CORRECT USAGE IN FRENCH AND PERPETUATING THE LANGUAGE THE FRENCH ACADEMY HAS TWO MAIN TASKS
StevenPinker_2005G@49.62:62.12 THEY ALSO LEGISLATE ON CORRECT USAGE SUCH AS THE PROPER TERM FOR WHAT THE FRENCH CALL EMAIL WHICH OUGHT TO BE COURRIEL THE WORLD WIDE WEB THE FRENCH ARE TOLD OUGHT TO BE REFERRED TO AS
StevenPinker_2005G@65.30:77.31 THE GLOBAL SPIDER WEB RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE FRENCH GAILY IGNORE NOW THIS IS ONE MODEL OF HOW LANGUAGE COMES TO BE NAMELY THAT IT'S LEGISLATED BY
StevenPinker_2005G@78.86:88.43 BUT ANYONE WHO LOOKS AT LANGUAGE REALIZES THAT THIS IS A RATHER SILLY CONCEIT THAT LANGUAGE RATHER EMERGES FROM HUMAN MINDS INTERACTING FROM ONE ANOTHER
StevenPinker_2005G@88.86:99.81 AND THIS IS VISIBLE IN THE UNSTOPPABLE CHANGE IN LANGUAGE IN THE FACT THAT BY THE TIME THE ACADEMY FINISHES THEIR DICTIONARY IT WILL ALREADY BE WELL OUT OF DATE WE SEE IT IN THE CONSTANT
StevenPinker_2005G@110.38:116.12 SO LANGUAGE IS NOT SO MUCH A CREATOR OR SHAPER OF HUMAN NATURE SO MUCH AS A WINDOW INTO HUMAN NATURE
StevenPinker_2005G@117.21:128.76 IN A BOOK THAT I'M CURRENTLY WORKING ON I HOPE TO USE LANGUAGE TO SHED LIGHT ON A NUMBER OF ASPECTS OF HUMAN NATURE INCLUDING THE COGNITIVE MACHINERY WITH WHICH HUMANS CONCEPTUALIZE THE WORLD
StevenPinker_2005G@141.43:149.39 INDULGE ME IN MY PASSION FOR VERBS AND HOW THEY'RE USED THE PROBLEM IS WHICH VERBS GO IN WHICH CONSTRUCTIONS
StevenPinker_2005G@149.56:155.82 THE VERB IS THE CHASSIS OF THE SENTENCE IT'S THE FRAMEWORK ONTO WHICH THE OTHER PARTS ARE BOLTED
StevenPinker_2005G@156.99:169.98 GIVE YOU A QUICK REMINDER OF SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE LONG FORGOTTEN AN INTRANSITIVE VERB SUCH AS DINE FOR EXAMPLE CAN'T TAKE A DIRECT OBJECT YOU HAVE TO SAY SAM DINED NOT SAM DINED THE PIZZA A TRANSITIVE VERB
StevenPinker_2005G@182.85:195.73 IN EXPLAINING HOW CHILDREN LEARN LANGUAGE A PROBLEM IN TEACHING LANGUAGE TO ADULTS SO THAT THEY DON'T MAKE GRAMMATICAL ERRORS AND A PROBLEM IN PROGRAMMING COMPUTERS TO USE LANGUAGE IS WHICH VERBS GO IN WHICH CONSTRUCTIONS
StevenPinker_2005G@196.30:210.24 FOR EXAMPLE THE DATIVE CONSTRUCTION IN ENGLISH YOU CAN SAY GIVE A MUFFIN TO A MOUSE THE PREPOSITIONAL DATIVE OR GIVE A MOUSE A MUFFIN THE DOUBLE OBJECT DATIVE PROMISE ANYTHING TO HER PROMISE HER ANYTHING AND SO ON HUNDREDS OF VERBS CAN GO BOTH WAYS
StevenPinker_2005G@227.62:236.07 THE SENTENCES THAT YOU'VE HEARD YOU'VE GOT TO EXTRACT GENERALIZATIONS SO YOU CAN PRODUCE AND UNDERSTAND NEW SENTENCES THIS WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO DO THAT
StevenPinker_2005G@243.51:251.20 BIFF DROVE CHICAGO THE CAR YOU CAN SAY SAL GAVE JASON A HEADACHE BUT IT'S A BIT ODD TO SAY SAL GAVE A HEADACHE TO JASON
StevenPinker_2005G@251.66:261.97 THE SOLUTION IS THAT THESE CONSTRUCTIONS DESPITE INITIAL APPEARANCE ARE NOT SYNONYMOUS THAT WHEN YOU CRANK UP THE MICROSCOPE ON HUMAN COGNITION YOU SEE THAT THERE'S A SUBTLE DIFFERENCE IN MEANING BETWEEN THEM
StevenPinker_2005G@262.48:273.70 SO GIVE THE X TO THE Y THAT CONSTRUCTION CORRESPONDS TO THE THOUGHT CAUSE X TO GO TO Y WHEREAS GIVE THE Y THE X CORRESPONDS TO THE THOUGHT CAUSE Y TO HAVE
StevenPinker_2005G@274.31:282.35 NOW MANY EVENTS CAN BE SUBJECT TO EITHER CONSTRUAL KIND OF LIKE THE CLASSIC FIGURE GROUND REVERSAL ILLUSIONS IN WHICH YOU CAN
StevenPinker_2005G@282.83:296.12 EITHER PAY ATTENTION TO A PARTICULAR OBJECT IN WHICH CASE THE SPACE AROUND IT RECEDES FROM ATTENTION OR YOU CAN SEE THE FACES IN THE EMPTY SPACE IN WHICH CASE THE OBJECT RECEDES OUT OF CONSCIOUSNESS
StevenPinker_2005G@296.52:306.40 HOW ARE THESE CONSTRUALS REFLECTED IN LANGUAGE WELL IN BOTH CASES THE THING THAT IS CONSTRUED AS BEING AFFECTED IS EXPRESSED AS THE DIRECT OBJECT THE NOUN AFTER THE VERB
StevenPinker_2005G@306.80:314.00 SO WHEN YOU THINK OF THE EVENT AS CAUSING THE MUFFIN TO GO SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING TO THE MUFFIN YOU SAY GIVE THE MUFFIN TO THE MOUSE
StevenPinker_2005G@314.27:322.02 WHEN YOU CONSTRUE IT AS CAUSE THE MOUSE TO HAVE SOMETHING YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING TO THE MOUSE AND THEREFORE YOU EXPRESS IT AS GIVE THE MOUSE THE MUFFIN
StevenPinker_2005G@322.70:331.58 SO WHICH VERBS GO IN WHICH CONSTRUCTION THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM WITH WHICH I BEGAN DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE VERB SPECIFIES A KIND OF MOTION OR A KIND OF POSSESSION CHANGE
StevenPinker_2005G@332.12:344.62 TO GIVE SOMETHING INVOLVES BOTH CAUSING SOMETHING TO GO AND CAUSING SOMEONE TO HAVE TO DRIVE THE CAR ONLY CAUSES SOMETHING TO GO BECAUSE CHICAGO 'S NOT THE KIND OF THING THAT CAN POSSESS SOMETHING ONLY HUMANS CAN POSSESS THINGS
StevenPinker_2005G@345.05:358.26 AND TO GIVE SOMEONE A HEADACHE CAUSES THEM TO HAVE THE HEADACHE BUT IT'S NOT AS IF YOU'RE TAKING THE HEADACHE OUT OF YOUR HEAD AND CAUSING IT TO GO TO THE OTHER PERSON AND THEN PLAN TO GET IT IN THEIR HEAD YOU MAY JUST BE LOUD OR OBNOXIOUS OR IN SOME OTHER WAY CAUSING THEM TO HAVE THE HEADACHE
StevenPinker_2005G@358.87:370.37 SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF THING THAT I DO IN MY DAY JOB SO WHY SHOULD ANYONE CARE WELL THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INTERESTING CONCLUSIONS I THINK FROM THIS
StevenPinker_2005G@370.76:379.60 AND FROM MANY SIMILAR KINDS OF ANALYSES OF HUNDREDS OF ENGLISH VERBS FIRST THERE'S A LEVEL OF FINE GRAINED CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURE WHICH WE AUTOMATICALLY
StevenPinker_2005G@379.96:387.91 AND UNCONSCIOUSLY COMPUTE EVERY TIME WE PRODUCE OR UTTER A SENTENCE THAT GOVERNS OUR USE OF LANGUAGE YOU CAN THINK OF THIS AS THE LANGUAGE OF THOUGHT
StevenPinker_2005G@389.50:398.12 IT SEEMS TO BE BASED ON A FIXED SET OF CONCEPTS WHICH GOVERN DOZENS OF CONSTRUCTIONS AND THOUSANDS OF VERBS NOT ONLY IN ENGLISH BUT IN ALL OTHER LANGUAGES
StevenPinker_2005G@410.23:419.94 ARGUED ARE THE BASIC FRAMEWORK FOR HUMAN THOUGHT AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT OUR UNCONSCIOUS USE OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO REFLECT THESE KANTIAN CATEGORIES DOESN'T CARE ABOUT
StevenPinker_2005G@456.77:465.39 THE CONTAINER METAPHOR OF COMMUNICATION IN WHICH WE CONCEIVE OF IDEAS AS OBJECTS SENTENCES AS CONTAINERS AND COMMUNICATION AS A KIND OF SENDING
StevenPinker_2005G@465.91:476.00 WE SAY WE GATHER OUR IDEAS TO PUT THEM INTO WORDS AND IF OUR WORDS AREN'T EMPTY OR HOLLOW WE MIGHT GET THESE IDEAS ACROSS TO A LISTENER WHO CAN UNPACK OUR WORDS TO EXTRACT THAT CONTENT
StevenPinker_2005G@476.60:487.57 THIS KIND OF VERBIAGE IS NOT THE EXCEPTION BUT THE RULE IT'S VERY HARD TO FIND ANY EXAMPLE OF ABSTRACT LANGUAGE THAT IS NOT BASED ON SOME CONCRETE METAPHOR FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN USE THE VERB
StevenPinker_2005G@488.29:497.23 GO AND THE PREPOSITIONS TO AND FROM IN A LITERAL SPATIAL SENSE THE MESSENGER WENT FROM PARIS TO ISTANBUL YOU CAN ALSO SAY BIFF WENT FROM SICK TO WELL
StevenPinker_2005G@498.05:504.67 GO ANYWHERE HE COULD HAVE BEEN IN BED THE WHOLE TIME BUT IT'S AS IF HIS HEALTH IS A POINT IN STATE SPACE THAT YOU CONCEPTUALIZE AS MOVING
StevenPinker_2005G@505.11:512.24 THE MEETING WENT FROM THREE TO FOUR IN WHICH WE CONCEIVE OF TIME AS STRETCHED ALONG A LINE LIKEWISE WE USE FORCE TO INDICATE
StevenPinker_2005G@513.04:521.09 NOT ONLY PHYSICAL FORCE AS IN ROSE FORCED THE DOOR TO OPEN BUT ALSO INTERPERSONAL FORCE AS IN ROSE FORCED SADIE TO GO NOT NECESSARILY BY
StevenPinker_2005G@521.65:531.13 MANHANDLING HER BUT BY ISSUING A THREAT OR ROSE FORCED HERSELF TO GO AS IF THERE WERE TWO ENTITIES INSIDE ROSE 'S HEAD ENGAGED IN A TUG OF A WAR
StevenPinker_2005G@531.92:544.15 SECOND CONCLUSION IS THAT THE ABILITY TO CONCEIVE OF A GIVEN EVENT IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS SUCH AS CAUSE SOMETHING TO GO TO SOMEONE AND CAUSING SOMEONE TO HAVE SOMETHING I THINK IS A FUNDAMENTAL
StevenPinker_2005G@544.86:550.99 FEATURE OF HUMAN THOUGHT AND IT'S THE BASIS FOR MUCH HUMAN ARGUMENTATION IN WHICH PEOPLE DON'T DIFFER SO MUCH ON THE FACTS
StevenPinker_2005G@551.32:559.78 ON HOW THEY OUGHT TO BE CONSTRUED JUST TO GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES ENDING A PREGNANCY VERSUS KILLING A FETUS A BALL OF CELLS VERSUS AN UNBORN CHILD
StevenPinker_2005G@560.38:568.60 INVADING IRAQ VERSUS LIBERATING IRAQ REDISTRIBUTING WEALTH VERSUS CONFISCATING EARNINGS AND I THINK THE BIGGEST PICTURE OF ALL WOULD
StevenPinker_2005G@569.86:578.30 TAKE SERIOUSLY THE FACT THAT SO MUCH OF OUR VERBIAGE ABOUT ABSTRACT EVENTS IS BASED ON A CONCRETE METAPHOR IT WOULD SEE HUMAN INTELLIGENCE ITSELF
StevenPinker_2005G@578.58:589.52 AS CONSISTING OF A REPERTOIRE OF CONCEPTS SUCH AS OBJECTS SPACE TIME CAUSATION AND INTENTION WHICH ARE USEFUL IN A SOCIAL KNOWLEDGE INTENSIVE SPECIES WHOSE EVOLUTION YOU CAN WELL
StevenPinker_2005G@590.28:598.43 IMAGINE AND A PROCESS OF METAPHORICAL ABSTRACTION THAT ALLOWS US TO BLEACH THESE CONCEPTS OF THEIR ORIGINAL CONCEPTUAL CONTENT
StevenPinker_2005G@599.41:604.43 SPACE TIME AND FORCE AND APPLY THEM TO NEW ABSTRACT DOMAINS THEREFORE
StevenPinker_2005G@604.74:614.09 ALLOWING A SPECIES THAT EVOLVED TO DEAL WITH ROCKS AND TOOLS AND ANIMALS TO CONCEPTUALIZE MATHEMATICS PHYSICS LAW AND OTHER ABSTRACT DOMAINS
StevenPinker_2005G@627.04:634.80 I'LL START OUT WITH A PUZZLE THE PUZZLE OF INDIRECT SPEECH ACTS NOW I'M SURE MOST OF YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE FARGO AND YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE SCENE IN WHICH THE
StevenPinker_2005G@661.27:673.04 FOR EXAMPLE IN POLITE REQUESTS IF SOMEONE SAYS IF YOU COULD PASS THE GUACAMOLE THAT WOULD BE AWESOME WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANS EVEN THOUGH THAT THAT'S A RATHER BIZARRE CONCEPT BEING EXPRESSED
StevenPinker_2005G@683.47:696.02 AND LIKEWISE IF SOMEONE SAYS NICE STORE YOU'VE GOT THERE IT WOULD BE A REAL SHAME IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO IT WE UNDERSTAND THAT AS A VEILED THREAT RATHER THAN A MUSING OF HYPOTHETICAL POSSIBILITIES SO THE PUZZLE IS WHY ARE
StevenPinker_2005G@696.46:705.07 BRIBES POLITE REQUESTS SOLICITATIONS AND THREATS SO OFTEN VEILED NO ONE 'S FOOLED BOTH PARTIES KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE SPEAKER MEANS AND
StevenPinker_2005G@705.21:711.27 THE SPEAKER KNOWS THE LISTENER KNOWS THAT THE SPEAKER KNOWS THAT THE LISTENER KNOWS ET CETERA ET CETERA SO WHAT'S GOING ON
StevenPinker_2005G@711.97:723.48 THE KEY IDEA IS THAT LANGUAGE IS A WAY OF NEGOTIATING RELATIONSHIPS AND HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS FALL INTO A NUMBER OF TYPES THERE'S AN INFLUENTIAL TAXONOMY BY THE ANTHROPOLOGIST ALAN FISKE IN WHICH
StevenPinker_2005G@747.61:755.50 NOW RELATIONSHIPS TYPES CAN BE NEGOTIATED EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE DEFAULT SITUATIONS IN WHICH ONE OF THESE MINDSETS CAN BE APPLIED
StevenPinker_2005G@755.71:766.02 THEY CAN BE STRETCHED AND EXTENDED FOR EXAMPLE COMMUNALITY APPLIES MOST NATURALLY WITHIN FAMILY OR FRIENDS BUT IT CAN BE USED TO TRY TO TRANSFER THE
StevenPinker_2005G@787.07:794.39 MISMATCHES WHEN ONE PERSON ASSUMES ONE RELATIONSHIP TYPE AND ANOTHER ASSUMES A DIFFERENT ONE CAN BE AWKWARD IF YOU WENT OVER AND YOU HELPED YOURSELF
StevenPinker_2005G@794.64:805.50 TO A SHRIMP OFF YOUR BOSS PLATE FOR EXAMPLE THAT WOULD BE AN AWKWARD SITUATION OR IF A DINNER GUEST AFTER THE MEAL PULLED OUT HIS WALLET AND OFFERED TO PAY YOU FOR THE MEAL THAT WOULD BE RATHER AWKWARD AS WELL
StevenPinker_2005G@805.88:811.10 IN LESS BLATANT CASES THERE'S STILL A KIND OF NEGOTIATION THAT OFTEN GOES ON
StevenPinker_2005G@811.74:820.89 THE WORKPLACE FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S OFTEN A TENSION OVER WHETHER AN EMPLOYEE CAN SOCIALIZE WITH THE BOSS OR REFER TO HIM OR HER ON A FIRST NAME BASIS
StevenPinker_2005G@821.26:829.25 IF TWO FRIENDS HAVE A RECIPROCAL TRANSACTION LIKE SELLING A CAR IT'S WELL KNOWN THAT THIS CAN BE A SOURCE OF TENSION OR AWKWARDNESS
StevenPinker_2005G@829.58:840.59 IN DATING THE TRANSITION FROM FRIENDSHIP TO SEX CAN LEAD TO NOTORIOUSLY TO VARIOUS FORMS OF AWKWARDNESS AND AS CAN SEX IN THE WORKPLACE IN WHICH WE CALL THE CONFLICT BETWEEN
StevenPinker_2005G@841.51:850.38 A DOMINANT AND A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP SEXUAL HARASSMENT WELL WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH LANGUAGE WELL LANGUAGE AS A SOCIAL INTERACTION HAS TO SATISFY TWO CONDITIONS
StevenPinker_2005G@850.82:858.82 YOU HAVE TO CONVEY THE ACTUAL CONTENT HERE WE GET BACK TO THE CONTAINER METAPHOR YOU WANT TO EXPRESS THE BRIBE THE COMMAND THE PROMISE THE
StevenPinker_2005G@866.21:878.42 THE SOLUTION I THINK IS THAT WE USE LANGUAGE AT TWO LEVELS THE LITERAL FORM SIGNALS THE SAFEST RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LISTENER WHEREAS THE IMPLICATED CONTENT THE READING BETWEEN THE LINES THAT WE COUNT ON THE LISTENER TO PERFORM
StevenPinker_2005G@879.23:889.68 ALLOWS THE LISTENER TO DERIVE THE INTERPRETATION WHICH IS MOST RELEVANT IN CONTEXT WHICH POSSIBLY INITIATES A CHANGED RELATIONSHIP THE SIMPLEST EXAMPLE OF THIS IS IN THE POLITE REQUEST
StevenPinker_2005G@890.38:901.99 IF YOU EXPRESS YOUR REQUEST AS A CONDITIONAL IF YOU COULD OPEN THE WINDOW THAT WOULD BE GREAT EVEN THOUGH THE CONTENT IS AN IMPERATIVE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE NOT USING THE IMPERATIVE VOICE MEANS THAT YOU'RE NOT
StevenPinker_2005G@902.79:910.59 ACTING AS IF YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP OF DOMINANCE WHERE YOU COULD PRESUPPOSE THE COMPLIANCE OF THE OTHER PERSON ON THE OTHER HAND YOU WANT THE DAMN GUACAMOLE
StevenPinker_2005G@910.91:921.65 BY EXPRESSING IT AS AN IF THEN STATEMENT YOU CAN GET THE MESSAGE ACROSS WITHOUT APPEARING TO BOSS ANOTHER PERSON AROUND AND IN A MORE SUBTLE WAY I THINK THIS WORKS FOR ALL OF THE
StevenPinker_2005G@922.33:935.88 VEILED SPEECH ACTS INVOLVING PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY THE BRIBES THREATS PROPOSITIONS SOLICITATIONS AND SO ON ONE WAY OF THINKING ABOUT IT IS TO IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF LANGUAGE WHERE IT COULD ONLY BE USED LITERALLY AND YOU CAN THINK OF IT IN TERMS OF A
StevenPinker_2005G@945.25:952.25 HIGH STAKES IN THE TWO POSSIBILITIES OF HAVING A DISHONEST OFFICER OR AN HONEST OFFICER
StevenPinker_2005G@952.67:960.75 IF YOU DON'T BRIBE THE OFFICER THEN YOU WILL GET A TRAFFIC TICKET OR AS IS THE CASE OF FARGO WORSE WHETHER THE HONEST
StevenPinker_2005G@961.09:971.28 OFFICER IS HONEST OR DISHONEST NOTHING VENTURED NOTHING GAINED IN THAT CASE THE CONSEQUENCES ARE RATHER SEVERE ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU EXTEND THE BRIBE IF THE
StevenPinker_2005G@982.59:994.67 ON THE OTHER HAND WITH INDIRECT LANGUAGE IF YOU ISSUE A VEILED BRIBE THEN THE DISHONEST OFFICER COULD INTERPRET IT AS A BRIBE IN WHICH CASE YOU GET THE PAYOFF OF GOING FREE THE HONEST OFFICER CAN'T
StevenPinker_2005G@995.60:1005.11 TO IT AS BEING A BRIBE AND THEREFORE YOU GET THE NUISANCE OF THE TRAFFIC TICKET SO YOU GET THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS AND A SIMILAR ANALYSIS I THINK CAN APPLY TO THE
StevenPinker_2005G@1015.96:1026.53 NAMELY THAT THE VAGUENESS OF LANGUAGE FAR FROM BEING A BUG OR AN IMPERFECTION ACTUALLY MIGHT BE A FEATURE OF LANGUAGE ONE THAT WE USE TO OUR ADVANTAGE IN SOCIAL INTERACTIONS
StevenPinker_2005G@1026.88:1035.80 SO TO SUM UP LANGUAGE IS A COLLECTIVE HUMAN CREATION REFLECTING HUMAN NATURE HOW WE CONCEPTUALIZE REALITY HOW WE RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER AND BY
