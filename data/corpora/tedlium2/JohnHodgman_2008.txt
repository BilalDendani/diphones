JohnHodgman_2008 WENT TO LUNCH AT LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY AND JOINED SOME COLLEAGUES THERE AND ASKED THEM A QUESTION WHERE IS EVERYBODY THIS CONFUSED HIS COLLEAGUES OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THEY WERE SITTING RIGHT THERE WITH HIM
JohnHodgman_2008 AND THEN HE HAD TO CLARIFY THAT HE WASN'T TALKING ABOUT THEM HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE SPACE ALIENS YOU SEE THIS WAS ONLY A FEW YEARS AFTER
JohnHodgman_2008 THE SUPPOSED FLYING SAUCER CRASH AT ROSWELL NEW MEXICO AND EVEN THOUGH THAT TURNED OUT TO BE NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL
JohnHodgman_2008 MERELY A DOWNED WEATHER BALLOON PILOTED BY SMALL HAIRLESS MEN WITH SLITS FOR MOUTHS STILL AMERICA HAD GONE SAUCER MAD EVEN FAMOUS SCIENTISTS WHO WERE EATING LUNCH
JohnHodgman_2008 WE SHOULD HAVE SOME EVIDENCE OF THEIR EXISTENCE BY NOW AND YET TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE WE ARE ALONE WHERE IS EVERYBODY ASKED FERMI AND HIS COLLEAGUES HAD NO ANSWER
JohnHodgman_2008 THEN WENT ON WITH THE SAME BLUNT LOGIC TO DISPROVE FAIRIES SASQUATCH GOD THE POSSIBILITY OF LOVE AND THEREAFTER AS YOU KNOW ENRICO FERMI ATE ALONE
JohnHodgman_2008 I AM NOT A SCIENTIST
JohnHodgman_2008 I HAVE NEVER BUILT AN ATOMIC PILE
JohnHodgman_2008 ALTHOUGH I MIGHT ARGUE THAT TECHNICALLY EVERY PILE IS ATOMIC
JohnHodgman_2008 DID NOT CONSIDER ONE IS THAT THE ALIENS MIGHT BE VERY FAR AWAY PERHAPS I DARE SAY EVEN ON OTHER PLANETS
JohnHodgman_2008 THE OTHER POSSIBILITY
JohnHodgman_2008 IS PERHAPS ENRICO FERMI HIMSELF WAS AN ALIEN
JohnHodgman_2008 THINK ABOUT IT ISN'T IT A LITTLE CONVENIENT THAT IN THE MIDST OF THE WORLD WAR OUT OF NOWHERE SUDDENLY AN ITALIAN SCIENTIST SHOWED UP WITH AN AMAZING NEW TECHNOLOGY
JohnHodgman_2008 WOULD TRANSFORM EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD AND DARKEN OUR HISTORY OF THE HUMAN SPECIES FOREVER AFTER AND ISN'T IT A LITTLE STRANGE THAT HE REQUIRED NO PAYMENT FOR
JohnHodgman_2008 THAT HE ASKED FOR ONLY ONE THING A GIFT OF TWO HEALTHY SPERM WHALES
JohnHodgman_2008 THAT'S THAT'S NOT TRUE BUT IT IS
JohnHodgman_2008 AND IF ENRICO FERMI WAS INDEED A SPACE ALIEN WOULDN'T HE BE
JohnHodgman_2008 FIRST TO HAVE TRIED TO CONVINCE HIS FELLOW SCIENTISTS THAT THE SPACE ALIENS ARE NOT ALREADY HERE FOR IT IS GIVEN IN CERTAIN UFO OLOGY OR UFOLOGY CIRCLES
JohnHodgman_2008 THAT THE ALIENS ARE ALREADY HERE AND HAVE BEEN FOR MILLENNIA THAT THEY HAVE WALKED AMONG US IN DISGUISE OBSERVING US GUIDING OUR EVOLUTION FROM APE TO MAN
JohnHodgman_2008 IF YOU BELIEVE IN THAT SORT OF THING
JohnHodgman_2008 AND OCCASIONALLY KIDNAPPING US IN THEIR FLYING SAUCERS AND TAKING US AWAY TO HAVE SEX WITH US IN PYRAMIDS
JohnHodgman_2008 IT'S A DIFFICULT THEORY TO DISCOUNT I THINK YOU'LL AGREE
JohnHodgman_2008 FOR EVEN IN MY OWN LIFE
JohnHodgman_2008 MEMORIES I HAVE THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN HAPPENINGS THAT ARE SO ODD AND UNACCOUNTABLY WEIRD THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THEY WERE NOT THE RESULT OF PROLONGED AND FREQUENT CONTACT WITH ALIENS THROUGHOUT MY LIFE
JohnHodgman_2008 FOR HOW ELSE WILL YOU EXPLAIN THE AMAZING AND ABSOLUTELY TRUE CLOSE ENCOUNTERS THAT I HAD AND WILL DESCRIBE TO YOU NOW
JohnHodgman_2008 I WAS PRETTY GOOD AT THE VIDEO GAMES I WAS NOT VERY GOOD AT THE OTHER PART SO I STAYED ALONE WITH THE COSMOS AND THAT'S WHEN IT
JohnHodgman_2008 ELDERLY COUPLE CAME WALKING DOWN THE STREET I WOULD SAY THEY WERE IN THEIR LATE SEVENTIES AND I WOULD SAY THAT THEY WERE ON A DATE BECAUSE HE WAS WEARING
JohnHodgman_2008 A VERY NEAT LITTLE SUIT WITH A YELLOW TIE BROWN SUIT AND SHE WAS WEARING A CARDIGAN BECAUSE IT WAS NOW FULLY NIGHT NOW AND A CHILL WAS COMING IN OFF THE OCEAN
JohnHodgman_2008 HAVE TO ADMIT THAT'S A PRETTY BOSS PIECE OF DETECTIVE WORK FOR AN OLD MAN ON A DATE
JohnHodgman_2008 BUT WHAT WAS STRANGER STILL AND EVEN I REALIZED IT AT THE TIME AS A NINE YEAR OLD CHILD WAS THAT THEY STOPPED AT ALL THAT THIS OLD MAN WOULD INTERRUPT HIS MOONLIGHT STROLL WITH HIS SWEETHEART WITH THE PRECISE REASON OF MAKING FUN OF A CHILD
JohnHodgman_2008 OH HE SAID LITTLE GREEN MEN AND THEN HIS GIRLFRIEND JOINED IN TOO THERE 'S NO SUCH THING AS SPACE MEN SHE SAID
JohnHodgman_2008 THERE 'S NO SUCH THING AND THEN THEY BOTH LAUGHED HA HA HA I LOOKED AROUND
JohnHodgman_2008 THE STREET WAS ENTIRELY EMPTY
JohnHodgman_2008 I HAD STOPPED HEARING THE SOUND OF THE OCEAN IT WAS AS THOUGH TIME HAD STOPPED I DID NOT KNOW WHY THEY WERE TEASING ME I LOOKED INTO THEIR STRANGELY ANGRY FACES AND I REMEMBER WONDERING
JohnHodgman_2008 ARE THEY WEARING RUBBER MASKS
JohnHodgman_2008 AND WHAT WOULD BE BEHIND THOSE RUBBER MASKS IF THEY WERE GIANT ALMOND SHAPED UNBLINKING EYES SLITS FOR MOUTHS
JohnHodgman_2008 THE OLD MAN CROOKED HIS FINGER AS THOUGH HE WERE FIRING A GUN AND THEN HE MADE LASER SOUNDS KEW KEW KEW WATCH OUT AND THEY TURNED AT ONCE AND WALKED AWAY
JohnHodgman_2008 THE OLD MAN REACHED OUT HIS KNOBBLY CLAW FOR THE WOMAN 'S HAND AND FOUND IT AND LEFT ME ALONE
JohnHodgman_2008 YOU COULD DESCRIBE THIS AS A SIMPLE MISUNDERSTANDING A STRANGE ENCOUNTER AMONG HUMANS MAYBE IT WAS SWAMP GAS BUT
JohnHodgman_2008 I KNOW WHAT I SAW
JohnHodgman_2008 SHE WAS VERY TALL I WOULD SAY I WAS STARTING HIGH SCHOOL AT THE TIME I WOULD SAY SHE WAS A JUNIOR BUT I HAD NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE SHE DIDN'T GO TO MY SCHOOL I DIDN'T KNOW HER NAME AND I NEVER WILL
JohnHodgman_2008 SHE WAS SITTING WITH SOMEONE WHO I PRESUME WAS HER MOTHER AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE NOVEL DUNE THEY WERE BOTH BIG FANS MOTHER AND DAUGHTER VERY UNUSUAL
JohnHodgman_2008 THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEIR FAVORITE CHARACTERS WERE THE GIANT SANDWORMS AND THEN IT GOT STRANGER
JohnHodgman_2008 THAT'S WHEN SHE TURNED TO ME AND SAID
JohnHodgman_2008 ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE MOVIE
JohnHodgman_2008 CARE ABOUT THE ANSWER AS THOUGH SHE JUST WANTED TO TALK TO ME I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY
JohnHodgman_2008 I SAID YES I DID NOT EVEN TURN MY HEAD THE MOVIE BEGAN
JohnHodgman_2008 I NEED NOT REMIND YOU THAT THIS WAS DAVID LYNCH 'S VERSION OF DUNE IN WHICH ALL OF THE CHARACTERS WERE SEXY AND DEFORMED AT THE SAME TIME
JohnHodgman_2008 THERE WAS A CHARACTER CALLED THE THIRD STAGE GUILD NAVIGATOR WHICH WAS A KIND OF GIANT FLOATING FETUS
JohnHodgman_2008 THAT LIVED IN A GIANT TANK WITH THIS ORANGE MIST OF PSYCHEDELIC SPICE SWIRLING AROUND HIM ALLOWING HIM TO BEND SPACE AND TIME
JohnHodgman_2008 HE COULD NEVER LEAVE THE TANK OR INTERACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD HE'D BECOME IN HIS ISOLATION SO DEFORMED AND SO SEXY THAT HE HAD TO TALK
JohnHodgman_2008 THROUGH A KIND OF OLD TIMEY RADIO TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND COULD NEVER TOUCH THEM I MEAN I LIKED HIM A LOT BETTER THAN THE SANDWORMS THE SANDWORMS WERE FINE BUT YOUR FAVORITE CHARACTER
JohnHodgman_2008 WHEN THE MOVIE ENDED
JohnHodgman_2008 AS I WALKED OUT HER PACE SLOWED PERHAPS IT WAS THE CRUTCHES BUT IT SEEMED
JohnHodgman_2008 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SHE MIGHT WANT TO TALK TO ME AGAIN WHEN I SAY IT OUT LOUD IT SOUNDS SO RIDICULOUS
JohnHodgman_2008 BUT I CAN ONLY COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS WHAT IN THE ALIEN ABDUCTEE COMMUNITY THEY CALL A SCREEN MEMORY
JohnHodgman_2008 A RIDICULOUS FALSE RECOLLECTION DESIGNED BY THEIR BRAIN TO COVER UP SOME TRAUMA SAY OF BEING KIDNAPPED AND FLOWN OFF TO A SEX PYRAMID
JohnHodgman_2008 IN WHICH HE DESCRIBED HIS OWN LIFELONG EXPERIENCES BEING ABDUCTED BY ALIENS AND HE ALSO DESCRIBED THE PHENOMENON KNOWN IN THIS COMMUNITY AS LOST TIME
JohnHodgman_2008 WHERE WHITLEY STRIEBER WOULD SUDDENLY BECOME AWARE THAT HE COULD NOT REMEMBER THE PREVIOUS TEN MINUTES OR THE PREVIOUS TEN HOURS OR THE PREVIOUS TEN DAYS AND WOULD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THAT WAS WHEN THE ALIENS WERE TAKING HIM AND GIVING HIM RECTAL PROBES
JohnHodgman_2008 THIS BOOK BECAME NATURALLY AN ENORMOUS BEST SELLER THIS IMAGE BY TED JOSEPH WAS FROM THAT BOOK AND WAS HIS SORT OF POLICE SKETCH OF WHAT THE CREATURES LOOKED LIKE THAT WHITLEY STRIEBER DESCRIBED
JohnHodgman_2008 AND WE DECIDED APROPOS OF NOTHING TO GO SEE THIS MOVIE AND THE WAY I REMEMBER IT THE MOVIE FEATURED THESE DETAILS ONE
JohnHodgman_2008 WAS PLAYED BY CHRISTOPHER WALKEN
JohnHodgman_2008 THE ALIEN WAS PLAYED BY A RUBBER PUPPET
JohnHodgman_2008 THREE THERE WAS A SURPRISINGLY LONG SEQUENCE OF THE FILM IN WHICH THE RUBBER PUPPET GIVES CHRISTOPHER WALKEN A RECTAL PROBE
JohnHodgman_2008 THIS WAS BEING SHOWN IN A REGULAR MOVIE THEATER IN CENTER CITY PHILADELPHIA FIVE ALL OF WHICH IS TO SAY THEY MADE A MOVIE OUT OF THE BOOK COMMUNION AND IT STARRED CHRISTOPHER WALKEN DOES SOMETHING SEEM STRANGE ABOUT THIS
JohnHodgman_2008 HOW DID THIS HAPPEN WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN
JohnHodgman_2008 I REMEMBER WALKING OUT OF THE THEATER AND BECOMING SUDDENLY AWARE OF THIS FACT AS WE WALKED HAND IN HAND AND PONDERING THESE VERY SAME QUESTIONS AND TO THIS DAY I HAVE NO ANSWER FOR
JohnHodgman_2008 THROUGH THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL TOGETHER
JohnHodgman_2008 WE STAYED IN OLD CRUMBLING WALLED CITIES IN TINY LITTLE HOTELS AND WE WOULD CLIMB UP TO THE ROOF AND DRINK VINHO VERDE AND WATCH THE SUN SET AND PLAY CHECKERS WHAT DID WE DO THIS REALLY DOES ANYONE DO THIS
JohnHodgman_2008 WE WENT TO SOME TOPLESS BEACHES EXCUSE ME NO
JohnHodgman_2008 NOT IN MY LIFE
JohnHodgman_2008 FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH WE WENT TO SAGRES WHICH WAS CONSIDERED AT THE TIME TO BE THE END OF THE WORLD AND THERE I WAS CHASED BY A PACK OF FERAL DOGS ON THE
JohnHodgman_2008 AND THE LEAD DOG BIT ME ON THE ASS REQUIRING ME TO GO TO A STRANGE PORTUGUESE CLINIC AND RECEIVE AN ASS SHOT MAKE OF THAT WHAT YOU WILL
JohnHodgman_2008 OUR LAST DAY IN PORTUGAL WE WERE IN THE DISTRICT CAPITAL
JohnHodgman_2008 AND CATHERINE DECIDED THAT SHE WANTED TO GO TO THE BEACH ONE LAST TIME NOW FARO IS A BUSTLING LITTLE CITY AND TO GET TO THE BEACH SHE EXPLAINED YOU WOULD HAVE TO TAKE
JohnHodgman_2008 BUS AND THEN A BOAT AND DID I WANT TO COME WITH BUT I WAS EXHAUSTED AND DOG BITTEN AND SO I SAID NO I REMEMBER WHAT SHE LOOKED LIKE BEFORE SHE LEFT
JohnHodgman_2008 THE FRECKLES HAD GROWN AND MULTIPLIED ON HER FACE AND SHOULDERS
JohnHodgman_2008 CLUSTERING INTO A KIND OF A TAN A TAN WE WERE BOTH TAN IS THIS TRUE HER EYES WERE EXTRA BRIGHT AND EXTRA BLUE AS A RESULT SHE WAS SMILING
JohnHodgman_2008 SHE WAS A SINGLE WOMAN ABOUT TO GO ALONE INTO A COUNTRY NOT EVEN SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE TO TRAVEL ALONE BY BUS AND BOAT TO GO TO A BEACH SHE DID NOT KNOW OR HAD NEVER SEEN
JohnHodgman_2008 I LOVED HER AND THEN SHE WENT OUT INTO THAT STRANGE ALIEN LAND
JohnHodgman_2008 IT TOOK ME SOME TIME TO COME TO MY SENSES
JohnHodgman_2008 NOW I DID NOT SPEAK PORTUGUESE
JohnHodgman_2008 I DID NOT KNOW WHERE THE BEACH WAS
JohnHodgman_2008 I REALIZED THAT THE DAY WOULD ONLY HAVE TWO POSSIBLE OUTCOMES EITHER CATHERINE WOULD COME BACK TO THE HOTEL
JohnHodgman_2008 OR SHE WOULD NEVER COME BACK TO THE HOTEL AND SO I SAT DOWN TO WAIT I DID NOT WATCH THE SKIES BUT THE VERY END OF THE STREET WHERE
JohnHodgman_2008 THE BUSES AND CARS AND PEDESTRIANS AND LITTLE SCOOTERS WERE MOVING ALONG AND I WATCHED THOSE CONSTELLATIONS SHIFT HOPING THAT THEY WOULD PART AND I WOULD SEE HER FACE
JohnHodgman_2008 WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN THAT VERY SMALL TOWN OF THIRTY THOUSAND OR SO THAT I TRULY APPRECIATED THE VASTNESS OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE SEARCHING WE MIGHT DO
JohnHodgman_2008 AND THAT'S WHEN THE LIBERIANS CAME ALONG
JohnHodgman_2008 FIVE YOUNG MEN ALL LAUGHING HAPPY TRAVELING TOGETHER COMING BACK TO THIS HOTEL WHERE THEY WERE
JohnHodgman_2008 ONE OF THEM WAS NAMED JOSEPH AND HE ASKED ME WHAT WAS I DOING AND I EXPLAINED AND HE SAID DON 'T WORRY HE WAS SURE THAT CATHERINE WOULD BE SAFE BUT HE DID NOT SEEM SO VERY SURE FOR HE SAT DOWN TO WAIT WITH ME
JohnHodgman_2008 AND EVEN NOW A DECADE AND A HALF LATER EVEN NOW THAT WE ARE MARRIED
JohnHodgman_2008 I LOOK FOR HER STILL WHENEVER SHE IS NOT IN THE ROOM AND EVEN THOUGH I THINK YOU'LL AGREE IT IS PROBABLE THAT DURING THE TIME SHE WAS AWAY SHE WAS KIDNAPPED AND REPLACED BY AN ALIEN CLONE
JohnHodgman_2008 I LOVE HER AND WAIT FOR HER STILL THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION
