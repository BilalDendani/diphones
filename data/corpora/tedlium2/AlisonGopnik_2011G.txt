AlisonGopnik_2011G IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE HAS COMPLETELY OVERTURNED THAT PICTURE SO IN SOME WAYS WE THINK THAT THIS BABY 'S THINKING IS LIKE THE THINKING OF THE MOST BRILLIANT SCIENTISTS LET ME GIVE YOU JUST ONE EXAMPLE
AlisonGopnik_2011G ONE THING THAT THIS BABY COULD BE THINKING ABOUT THAT COULD BE GOING ON IN HIS MIND IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT 'S GOING ON IN THE MIND OF THAT OTHER BABY
AlisonGopnik_2011G WE WANTED TO KNOW IF BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN COULD UNDERSTAND THIS REALLY PROFOUND THING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE NOW THE QUESTION IS HOW COULD WE ASK
AlisonGopnik_2011G AND ONE BOWL OF DELICIOUS GOLDFISH CRACKERS NOW ALL OF THE BABIES EVEN IN BERKLEY
AlisonGopnik_2011G SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD THE BABY GIVE HER WHAT THEY LIKED OR WHAT SHE
AlisonGopnik_2011G SO CHILDREN BOTH KNOW MORE AND LEARN MORE THAN WE EVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF STUDIES OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THAT 'S ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATED
AlisonGopnik_2011G IN MANY WAYS THEY 'RE WORSE THAN USELESS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PUT SO MUCH TIME AND ENERGY INTO JUST KEEPING THEM ALIVE
AlisonGopnik_2011G BIRDS EVEN MARSUPIALS LIKE KANGAROOS AND WOMBATS IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE 'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HOW LONG A CHILDHOOD A SPECIES HAS AND HOW BIG THEIR BRAINS ARE COMPARED TO THEIR BODIES AND HOW SMART AND FLEXIBLE
AlisonGopnik_2011G ARE INCREDIBLY SMART BIRDS THEY 'RE AS SMART AS CHIMPANZEES IN SOME RESPECTS AND THIS IS A BIRD ON THE COVER OF SCIENCE
AlisonGopnik_2011G WHO 'S LEARNED HOW TO USE A TOOL TO GET FOOD
AlisonGopnik_2011G ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE OUR FRIEND THE DOMESTIC CHICKEN
AlisonGopnik_2011G AND CHICKENS AND DUCKS AND GEESE AND TURKEYS ARE BASICALLY AS DUMB AS DUMPS SO THEY 'RE VERY VERY GOOD AT PECKING FOR GRAIN AND THEY 'RE NOT MUCH GOOD AT DOING ANYTHING ELSE
AlisonGopnik_2011G WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT THE BABIES THE NEW CALEDONIAN CROW BABIES ARE FLEDGLINGS THEY DEPEND ON THEIR MOMS TO DROP WORMS IN THEIR LITTLE OPEN MOUTHS FOR AS LONG AS TWO YEARS WHICH IS A REALLY LONG TIME IN THE LIFE OF A BIRD WHEREAS THE CHICKENS ARE ACTUALLY MATURE WITHIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS
AlisonGopnik_2011G WELL WHAT KIND OF EXPLANATION COULD WE HAVE FOR THIS WELL SOME ANIMALS LIKE THE CHICKEN SEEM TO BE BEAUTIFULLY SUITED TO DOING JUST ONE THING VERY WELL SO THEY SEEM TO BE BEAUTIFULLY SUITED TO PECKING GRAIN IN ONE ENVIRONMENT
AlisonGopnik_2011G AND OF COURSE WE HUMAN BEINGS ARE WAY OUT ON THE END OF THE DISTRIBUTION LIKE THE CROWS
AlisonGopnik_2011G THAT STRATEGY THAT LEARNING STRATEGY IS AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL GREAT STRATEGY FOR GETTING ON IN THE WORLD BUT IT HAS ONE BIG DISADVANTAGE AND THAT ONE BIG DISADVANTAGE IS THAT UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY DO ALL THAT LEARNING YOU 'RE GOING TO BE HELPLESS SO YOU DON 'T WANT
AlisonGopnik_2011G THAT PROBLEM IS WITH A KIND OF DIVISION OF LABOR SO THE IDEA IS THAT WE HAVE THIS EARLY PERIOD WHEN WE 'RE COMPLETELY PROTECTED WE DON 'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS LEARN AND THEN AS ADULTS WE CAN TAKE ALL THOSE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED WHEN WE WERE BABIES AND CHILDREN AND ACTUALLY PUT THEM TO WORK TO DO THINGS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD
AlisonGopnik_2011G SO ONE WAY OF THINKING ABOUT IT IS THAT BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN ARE LIKE THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DIVISION OF THE HUMAN SPECIES
AlisonGopnik_2011G IF THIS IS TRUE IF THESE BABIES ARE DESIGNED TO LEARN AND THIS EVOLUTIONARY STORY WOULD SAY CHILDREN ARE FOR LEARNING THAT 'S WHAT THEY 'RE FOR WE MIGHT EXPECT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE REALLY POWERFUL LEARNING
AlisonGopnik_2011G AND SO FORTH AND WHAT BAYES SHOWED WAS A MATHEMATICAL WAY THAT YOU COULD DO THAT AND THAT
AlisonGopnik_2011G MATHEMATICS IS AT THE CORE OF THE BEST MACHINE LEARNING PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE NOW
AlisonGopnik_2011G AND SOME TEN YEARS AGO I SUGGESTED THAT BABIES MIGHT BE DOING THE SAME THING SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT 'S GOING ON UNDERNEATH THOSE BEAUTIFUL BROWN EYES
AlisonGopnik_2011G I THINK IT ACTUALLY LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS THIS IS REVEREND BAYES 'S NOTEBOOK SO I THINK THOSE BABIES ARE ACTUALLY MAKING COMPLICATED CALCULATIONS WITH CONDITIONAL PROBABILITIES THAT THEY 'RE REVISING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE WORLD WORKS
AlisonGopnik_2011G SO TO TEST THIS WE USED A MACHINE THAT WE HAVE CALLED THE BLICKET DETECTOR THIS IS A BOX THAT LIGHTS UP AND PLAYS MUSIC WHEN YOU PUT SOME THINGS ON IT AND NOT OTHERS AND USING THIS VERY SIMPLE MACHINE MY
AlisonGopnik_2011G SO THE UNLIKELY HYPOTHESIS
AlisonGopnik_2011G ACTUALLY HAS STRONGER EVIDENCE IT LOOKS AS IF THE WAVING IS A MORE EFFECTIVE STRATEGY THAN THE OTHER STRATEGY SO WE DID JUST THIS WE GAVE FOUR YEAR OLDS THIS PATTERN OF EVIDENCE AND WE JUST ASKED THEM TO MAKE IT GO AND SURE ENOUGH THE FOUR YEAR OLDS USED THE EVIDENCE TO WAVE THE OBJECT ON TOP OF THE DETECTOR
AlisonGopnik_2011G NOW THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT ARE REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THIS THE FIRST ONE IS AGAIN REMEMBER THESE ARE FOUR YEAR OLDS THEY 'RE JUST LEARNING HOW TO COUNT BUT UNCONSCIOUSLY THEY 'RE DOING THESE QUITE COMPLICATED CALCULATIONS THAT WILL GIVE THEM A CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY MEASURE
AlisonGopnik_2011G AND THE OTHER INTERESTING THING IS THAT THEY 'RE USING THAT EVIDENCE TO GET TO AN IDEA GET TO A HYPOTHESIS ABOUT THE WORLD THAT SEEMS VERY UNLIKELY TO BEGIN WITH AND IN STUDIES WE 'VE JUST BEEN DOING IN MY LAB SIMILAR STUDIES WE 'VE SHOW THAT FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE ACTUALLY
AlisonGopnik_2011G BETTER AT FINDING OUT AN UNLIKELY HYPOTHESIS THAN ADULTS ARE WHEN WE GIVE THEM EXACTLY THE SAME
AlisonGopnik_2011G AND THERE 'S BEEN A BUNCH OF INTERESTING STUDIES RECENTLY THAT HAVE SHOWN THIS PLAYING AROUND IS REALLY A KIND OF EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAM HERE 'S ONE FROM CRISTINE LEGARE 'S LAB WHAT CRISTINE DID WAS USE OUR BLICKET DETECTORS
AlisonGopnik_2011G AND WHAT SHE DID WAS SHOW CHILDREN THAT YELLOW ONES MADE IT GO AND RED ONES DIDN 'T AND THEN SHE SHOWED THEM AN ANOMALY
AlisonGopnik_2011G BOY BUT WHAT CRISTINE DISCOVERED IS THIS IS ACTUALLY QUITE TYPICAL IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY CHILDREN PLAY WHEN YOU ASK THEM TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING WHAT THEY REALLY DO IS DO A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS
AlisonGopnik_2011G THIS IS ACTUALLY PRETTY TYPICAL OF FOUR YEAR
AlisonGopnik_2011G AND I THINK JUST THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE I THINK BABIES AND CHILDREN ARE ACTUALLY MORE CONSCIOUS THAN WE ARE AS ADULTS
AlisonGopnik_2011G NOW HERE 'S WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HOW ADULT CONSCIOUSNESS WORKS AND
AlisonGopnik_2011G ADULTS ATTENTION AND CONSCIOUSNESS LOOK KIND OF LIKE A SPOTLIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS FOR ADULTS IS WE DECIDE THAT SOMETHING 'S RELEVANT OR IMPORTANT WE SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO IT
AlisonGopnik_2011G DOWN ACTIVITY IN ALL THE REST OF OUR BRAINS SO WE HAVE A VERY FOCUSED PURPOSE DRIVEN KIND OF ATTENTION IF WE LOOK AT BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN WE SEE SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT
AlisonGopnik_2011G I THINK BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN SEEM TO HAVE MORE OF A LANTERN OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAN A SPOTLIGHT OF CONSCIOUSNESS
AlisonGopnik_2011G AND IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK IN THEIR BRAINS YOU SEE THAT THEY 'RE FLOODED WITH THESE NEUROTRANSMITTERS THAT ARE REALLY GOOD AT INDUCING LEARNING AND PLASTICITY AND THE INHIBITORY PARTS HAVEN 'T COME ON YET SO WHEN WE SAY THAT BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN ARE BAD AT PAYING ATTENTION WHAT WE REALLY MEAN IS THAT THEY
AlisonGopnik_2011G WELL IF WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT A WAY OF GETTING A TASTE OF THAT KIND OF BABY CONSCIOUSNESS AS ADULTS I THINK THE BEST THING IS THINK ABOUT CASES WHERE WE 'RE PUT IN A NEW SITUATION THAT WE 'VE NEVER BEEN IN BEFORE WHEN WE FALL IN LOVE
AlisonGopnik_2011G AND BY THE WAY THAT COFFEE THAT WONDERFUL COFFEE YOU 'VE BEEN DRINKING DOWNSTAIRS ACTUALLY MIMICS THE EFFECT OF THOSE BABY NEUROTRANSMITTERS SO WHAT 'S IT LIKE TO BE A BABY IT 'S LIKE BEING IN LOVE IN PARIS
AlisonGopnik_2011G FIRST TIME AFTER YOU 'VE HAD THREE DOUBLE ESPRESSOS
AlisonGopnik_2011G THAT 'S A FANTASTIC WAY TO BE BUT IT DOES TEND TO LEAVE YOU WAKING UP CRYING AT THREE O 'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
