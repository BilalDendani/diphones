DevduttPattanaik_2009I@17.24:26.61 TO UNDERSTAND THE BUSINESS OF MYTHOLOGY AND WHAT A CHIEF BELIEF OFFICER IS SUPPOSED TO DO YOU HAVE TO HEAR A STORY
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@28.39:33.76 THE ELEPHANT HEADED GOD WHO IS THE SCRIBE OF STORYTELLERS AND HIS BROTHER
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@34.67:44.40 THE ATHLETIC WARLORD OF THE GODS KARTIKEYA THE TWO BROTHERS ONE DAY DECIDED TO GO ON A RACE THREE TIMES AROUND THE WORLD
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@47.89:54.84 AND FLEW AROUND THE CONTINENTS AND THE MOUNTAINS AND THE OCEANS
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@55.86:64.18 HE WENT AROUND ONCE HE WENT AROUND TWICE HE WENT AROUND THRICE BUT HIS BROTHER
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@65.72:73.22 SIMPLY WALKED AROUND HIS PARENTS ONCE TWICE THRICE AND SAID I WON HOW
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@73.44:82.25 COME SAID KARTIKEYA AND GANESHA SAID YOU WENT AROUND THE WORLD I WENT AROUND MY WORLD
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@82.82:84.22 WHAT MATTERS MORE
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@84.94:99.12 IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WORLD AND MY WORLD YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOGOS AND MYTHOS THE WORLD IS OBJECTIVE LOGICAL UNIVERSAL FACTUAL SCIENTIFIC
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@99.75:113.14 MY WORLD IS SUBJECTIVE IT'S EMOTIONAL IT'S PERSONAL IT'S PERCEPTIONS THOUGHTS FEELINGS DREAMS IT IS THE BELIEF SYSTEM THAT WE CARRY IT'S THE MYTH THAT WE LIVE IN
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@116.65:123.42 HOW THE WORLD FUNCTIONS HOW THE SUN RISES HOW WE ARE BORN MY
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@125.06:127.63 WHY THE SUN RISES WHY
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@130.55:143.57 EVERY CULTURE IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ITSELF WHY DO WE EXIST AND EVERY CULTURE COMES UP WITH ITS OWN UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE ITS OWN CUSTOMIZED VERSION OF MYTHOLOGY
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@144.76:152.41 CULTURE IS A REACTION TO NATURE AND THIS UNDERSTANDING OF OUR ANCESTORS IS TRANSMITTED GENERATION FROM GENERATION
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@152.69:160.19 IN THE FORM OF STORIES SYMBOLS AND RITUALS WHICH ARE ALWAYS INDIFFERENT TO RATIONALITY
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@161.24:174.39 AND SO WHEN YOU STUDY IT YOU REALIZE THAT DIFFERENT PEOPLE OF THE WORLD HAVE A DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD DIFFERENT PEOPLE SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS THERE IS MY WORLD AND THERE IS YOUR WORLD
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@174.85:184.57 AND MY WORLD IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN YOUR WORLD BECAUSE MY WORLD YOU SEE IS RATIONAL AND YOURS IS SUPERSTITION YOURS IS FAITH YOURS IS
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@194.71:206.03 ON THE BANKS OF A RIVER CALLED THE INDUS NOW IN PAKISTAN THIS RIVER LENDS ITSELF TO INDIA 'S NAME INDIA INDUS
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@207.86:214.93 ALEXANDER A YOUNG MACEDONIAN MET THERE WHAT HE CALLED A GYMNOSOPHIST WHICH MEANS
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@215.21:221.15 THE NAKED WISE MAN WE DON'T KNOW WHO HE WAS PERHAPS HE WAS A JAIN MONK
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@241.14:250.32 THE GYMNOSOPHIST ASKED WHAT ARE YOU DOING AND ALEXANDER SAID I AM CONQUERING THE WORLD AND THEY BOTH LAUGHED
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@251.39:259.26 EACH ONE THOUGHT THAT THE OTHER WAS A FOOL THE GYMNOSOPHIST SAID WHY IS HE CONQUERING THE WORLD
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@259.73:266.21 IT'S POINTLESS AND ALEXANDER THOUGHT WHY IS HE SITTING AROUND DOING NOTHING
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@269.07:282.32 TO UNDERSTAND THIS DIFFERENCE IN VIEWPOINTS WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE SUBJECTIVE TRUTH OF ALEXANDER HIS MYTH AND THE MYTHOLOGY THAT CONSTRUCTED IT
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@292.15:298.32 WHO WHEN HE PARTICIPATED IN BATTLE VICTORY WAS ASSURED BUT WHEN HE WITHDREW FROM THE BATTLE
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@299.39:310.86 DEFEAT WAS INEVITABLE ACHILLES WAS A MAN WHO COULD SHAPE HISTORY A MAN OF DESTINY AND THIS IS WHAT YOU SHOULD BE ALEXANDER THAT'S WHAT
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@312.70:322.63 WHAT SHOULD YOU NOT BE YOU SHOULD NOT BE SISYPHUS WHO ROLLS A ROCK UP A MOUNTAIN ALL DAY ONLY TO FIND THE BOULDER ROLLED DOWN AT NIGHT
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@325.90:335.94 DON'T LIVE A LIFE WHICH IS MONOTONOUS MEDIOCRE MEANINGLESS BE SPECTACULAR LIKE THE GREEK HEROES LIKE JASON
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@336.42:348.84 WHO WENT ACROSS THE SEA WITH THE ARGONAUTS AND FETCHED THE GOLDEN FLEECE BE SPECTACULAR LIKE THESEUS WHO ENTERED THE LABYRINTH AND KILLED THE BULL HEADED MINOTAUR
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@350.05:362.26 WHEN YOU PLAY IN A RACE WIN BECAUSE WHEN YOU WIN THE EXHILARATION OF VICTORY IS THE CLOSEST YOU WILL COME TO THE AMBROSIA OF THE GODS
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@363.07:371.05 BECAUSE YOU SEE THE GREEKS BELIEVED YOU LIVE ONLY ONCE AND WHEN YOU DIE YOU HAVE TO CROSS THE RIVER STYX
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@371.43:378.74 AND IF YOU HAVE LIVED AN EXTRAORDINARY LIFE YOU WILL BE WELCOMED TO ELYSIUM OR WHAT THE FRENCH
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@383.15:385.19 THE HEAVEN OF THE HEROES
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@388.39:395.58 BUT THESE ARE NOT THE STORIES THAT THE GYMNOSOPHIST HEARD HE HEARD A VERY DIFFERENT STORY
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@396.44:402.57 HE HEARD OF A MAN CALLED BHARAT AFTER WHOM INDIA IS CALLED BHARATA BHARAT ALSO CONQUERED THE
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@404.67:411.81 AND THEN HE WENT TO THE TOP MOST PEAK OF THE GREATEST MOUNTAIN OF THE CENTER OF THE WORLD CALLED MERU AND HE WANTED TO
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@412.45:424.21 HOIST HIS FLAG TO SAY I WAS HERE FIRST BUT WHEN HE REACHED THE MOUNTAIN PEAK HE FOUND THE PEAK COVERED WITH COUNTLESS FLAGS
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@427.09:430.37 BEFORE HIM EACH ONE CLAIMING I WAS
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@442.76:449.65 THIS WAS THE MYTHOLOGY OF THE GYMNOSOPHIST YOU SEE HE HAD HEROES LIKE RAM
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@451.90:461.12 AND KRISHNA GOVINDA HARI BUT THEY WERE NOT TWO CHARACTERS ON TWO DIFFERENT ADVENTURES THEY WERE TWO LIFETIMES OF THE SAME HERO
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@470.23:482.28 YOU SEE THE INDIANS ALSO HAD A RIVER THAT SEPARATES THE LAND OF THE LIVING FROM THE LAND OF THE DEAD BUT YOU DON'T CROSS IT ONCE YOU GO TO AND FRO ENDLESSLY IT WAS CALLED THE
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@484.77:493.74 YOU GO AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN BECAUSE YOU SEE NOTHING LASTS FOREVER IN INDIA NOT EVEN DEATH AND SO YOU HAVE THESE GRAND RITUALS
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@494.46:501.67 GREAT IMAGES OF MOTHER GODDESSES ARE BUILT AND WORSHIPED FOR TEN DAYS AND WHAT DO YOU DO AT THE END OF TEN DAYS YOU DUNK IT IN
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@511.73:519.18 AND THIS RULE APPLIES NOT JUST TO MAN BUT ALSO THE GODS YOU SEE THE GODS
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@519.35:532.34 HAVE TO COME BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AS RAM AS KRISHNA NOT ONLY DO THEY LIVE INFINITE LIVES BUT THE SAME LIFE IS LIVED INFINITE TIMES TILL YOU GET TO THE POINT OF IT ALL
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@534.93:537.05 GROUNDHOG DAY
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@541.84:548.62 TWO DIFFERENT MYTHOLOGIES WHICH IS RIGHT TWO DIFFERENT MYTHOLOGIES TWO DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT THE WORLD
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@549.12:557.36 ONE LINEAR ONE CYCLICAL ONE BELIEVES THIS IS THE ONE AND ONLY LIFE THE OTHER BELIEVES THIS IS ONE OF MANY LIVES
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@558.53:566.66 AND SO THE DENOMINATOR OF ALEXANDER 'S LIFE WAS ONE SO THE VALUE OF HIS LIFE WAS THE SUM TOTAL OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@568.17:575.62 THE DENOMINATOR OF THE GYMNOSOPHIST 'S LIFE WAS INFINITY SO NO MATTER WHAT HE DID IT WAS ALWAYS ZERO
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@576.41:583.94 AND I BELIEVE IT IS THIS MYTHOLOGICAL PARADIGM THAT INSPIRED INDIAN MATHEMATICIANS TO DISCOVER THE NUMBER ZERO
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@601.15:608.29 YOU SEE WHAT IS BUSINESS BUT THE RESULT OF HOW THE MARKET BEHAVES AND HOW THE ORGANIZATION BEHAVES
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@619.99:629.16 IF YOU LIVE ONLY ONCE IN ONE LIFE CULTURES AROUND THE WORLD YOU WILL SEE AN OBSESSION WITH BINARY LOGIC ABSOLUTE TRUTH STANDARDIZATION ABSOLUTENESS
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@630.49:638.75 IN DESIGN BUT IF YOU LOOK AT CULTURES WHICH HAVE CYCLICAL AND BASED ON INFINITE LIVES YOU WILL SEE A COMFORT WITH FUZZY LOGIC
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@641.46:644.38 WITH CONTEXTUAL THINKING WITH EVERYTHING
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@650.09:659.66 LOOK AT ART LOOK AT THE BALLERINA HOW LINEAR SHE IS IN HER PERFORMANCE AND THEN LOOK AT THE INDIAN CLASSICAL DANCER THE KUCHIPUDI DANCER THE BHARATANATYAM DANCER
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@664.43:671.79 AND THEN LOOK AT BUSINESS STANDARD BUSINESS MODEL VISION MISSION VALUES PROCESSES
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@672.30:681.22 SOUNDS VERY MUCH LIKE THE JOURNEY THROUGH THE WILDERNESS TO THE PROMISED LAND WITH THE COMMANDMENTS HELD BY THE LEADER AND IF YOU COMPLY YOU WILL GO TO HEAVEN
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@693.92:704.86 YOU SEE BUSINESSES ARE NOT RUN AS INSTITUTIONS BY THE IDIOSYNCRASIES OF INDIVIDUALS IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT TASTE IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT MY
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@707.33:714.25 YOU SEE INDIAN MUSIC FOR EXAMPLE DOES NOT HAVE THE CONCEPT OF HARMONY THERE IS NO ORCHESTRA CONDUCTOR
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@715.05:721.54 IS ONE PERFORMER STANDING THERE AND EVERYBODY FOLLOWS AND YOU CAN NEVER REPLICATE THAT PERFORMANCE TWICE
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@722.52:731.35 IT IS NOT ABOUT DOCUMENTATION AND CONTRACT IT'S ABOUT CONVERSATION AND FAITH IT'S NOT ABOUT COMPLIANCE IT'S ABOUT SETTING
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@769.71:779.93 WHICH IS ROOTED IN ONE LIFE CULTURE AND A CLASH IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE LIKE ON THE BANKS OF THE INDUS IT IS BOUND TO HAPPEN
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@781.02:786.03 I HAVE PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED IT I'M TRAINED AS A MEDICAL DOCTOR I DID NOT WANT TO STUDY SURGERY DON'T ASK ME
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@787.52:795.75 I LOVE MYTHOLOGY TOO MUCH I WANTED TO LEARN MYTHOLOGY BUT THERE IS NOWHERE YOU CAN STUDY SO I HAD TO TEACH IT TO MYSELF AND MYTHOLOGY DOES NOT PAY WELL UNTIL NOW
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@818.02:830.15 WHEN THEY WERE DEALING WITH INDIA EXAMPLE PLEASE TELL US THE PROCESS TO INVOICE HOSPITALS STEP A STEP B STEP C MOSTLY

DevduttPattanaik_2009I@846.34:855.50 YOU SEE HE HAS ESTABLISHED THE LARGEST RETAIL CHAIN CALLED BIG BAZAAR AND THERE ARE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FORMATS ACROSS FIFTY CITIES AND TOWNS OF INDIA
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@855.83:868.23 AND HE WAS DEALING WITH DIVERSE AND DYNAMIC MARKETS AND HE KNEW VERY INTUITIVELY THAT BEST PRACTICES DEVELOPED IN JAPAN AND CHINA AND EUROPE AND AMERICA WILL NOT WORK IN INDIA
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@869.24:876.59 HE KNEW THAT INSTITUTIONAL THINKING DOESN'T WORK IN INDIA INDIVIDUAL THINKING DOES HE HAD AN INTUITIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MYTHIC STRUCTURE OF INDIA
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@886.60:894.24 YOU CAN'T MEASURE IT YOU CAN'T MANAGE IT SO HOW DO YOU CONSTRUCT BELIEF HOW DO YOU ENHANCE THE SENSITIVITY OF PEOPLE TO INDIAN NESS
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@917.53:929.58 SO WHEN YOU GO TO THE TEMPLE ALL YOU SEEK IS AN AUDIENCE WITH GOD YOU WANT TO SEE GOD AND YOU WANT GOD TO SEE YOU AND HENCE THE GODS HAVE VERY LARGE EYES LARGE UNBLINKING EYES SOMETIMES MADE OF SILVER
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@930.94:941.80 SO THEY LOOK AT YOU BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE RIGHT OR WRONG AND SO ALL YOU SEEK IS DIVINE EMPATHY JUST KNOW WHERE I CAME FROM WHY I DID THE
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@943.84:948.77 WHY DID I DO THE SETTING WHY I DON'T CARE FOR THE PROCESSES JUST UNDERSTAND

DevduttPattanaik_2009I@967.29:975.13 THE KEYS AND THEN YOU REMOVE THE BLINDFOLD AND INVARIABLY YOU SEE A TEAR BECAUSE THE PENNY HAS DROPPED
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@975.83:983.09 HE REALIZES THAT TO SUCCEED HE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A PROFESSIONAL HE DOES NOT HAVE
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@990.91:1003.59 MAKE THEM HAPPY TO MAKE THE BOSS HAPPY TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY THE CUSTOMER IS HAPPY BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER IS GOD THAT SENSITIVITY IS WHAT WE NEED ONCE THIS BELIEF ENTERS BEHAVIOR WILL HAPPEN BUSINESS WILL HAPPEN AND IT
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@1014.47:1026.59 THIS WAY OR THAT WAY AND IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS QUESTION BECAUSE IT LEADS YOU TO THE PATH OF FUNDAMENTALISM AND VIOLENCE SO I WILL NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION WHAT I WILL GIVE YOU IS AN INDIAN ANSWER THE INDIAN HEAD SHAKE
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@1049.15:1057.47 AND SO THE NEXT TIME YOU MEET SOMEONE A STRANGER ONE REQUEST UNDERSTAND THAT YOU LIVE IN THE SUBJECTIVE TRUTH
DevduttPattanaik_2009I@1057.81:1065.16 AND SO DOES HE UNDERSTAND IT AND WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND IT YOU WILL DISCOVER SOMETHING SPECTACULAR
