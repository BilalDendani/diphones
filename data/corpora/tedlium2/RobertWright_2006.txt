RobertWright_2006@12.91:22.56 GOT APPARENTLY EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO CONVINCE YOU THAT HISTORY HAS A DIRECTION AN ARROW THAT IN SOME FUNDAMENTAL SENSE IT'S GOOD THAT THE ARROW POINTS TO SOMETHING POSITIVE
RobertWright_2006@24.17:30.35 NOW WHEN THE TED PEOPLE FIRST APPROACHED ME ABOUT GIVING THIS UPBEAT TALK THAT WAS BEFORE
RobertWright_2006@31.63:43.81 THE CARTOON OF MUHAMMAD HAD TRIGGERED GLOBAL RIOTING IT WAS BEFORE THE AVIAN FLU HAD REACHED EUROPE IT WAS BEFORE HAMAS HAD WON THE PALESTINIAN ELECTION ELICITING VARIOUS COUNTER MEASURES BY ISRAEL AND TO BE HONEST
RobertWright_2006@45.69:49.98 WHEN I WAS ASKED TO GIVE THIS UPBEAT TALK THAT EVEN AS I WAS GIVING THE UPBEAT TALK
RobertWright_2006@50.71:52.83 THE APOCALYPSE WOULD BE UNFOLDING
RobertWright_2006@54.45:60.98 I MIGHT HAVE SAID IS IT OKAY IF I TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE BUT I DIDN 'T OK SO WE'RE HERE I'LL DO WHAT I CAN
RobertWright_2006@63.13:63.66 I CAN I'VE GOT
RobertWright_2006@66.46:74.71 THE SENSE IN WHICH MY WORLDVIEW IS UPBEAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF SUBTLE SOMETIMES EVEN ELUSIVE
RobertWright_2006@76.71:77.69 SENSE IN WHICH I CAN
RobertWright_2006@77.79:86.73 BE UPLIFTING AND INSPIRING I MEAN THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A KIND OF A CERTAIN GRIM DIMENSION TO THE WAY I TRY TO UPLIFT SO IF GRIM INSPIRATION
RobertWright_2006@87.01:97.34 IF GRIM INSPIRATION IS NOT A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS THAT IS I'M AFRAID THE MOST YOU CAN HOPE FOR OK TODAY THAT'S IF I SUCCEED I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO OK
RobertWright_2006@98.24:110.43 NOW IN ONE SENSE THE CLAIM THAT HISTORY HAS A DIRECTION IS NOT THAT CONTROVERSIAL IF YOU'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL STRUCTURE OK CLEARLY THAT'S GOTTEN MORE COMPLEX A LITTLE OVER THE LAST TEN THOUSAND YEARS HAS REACHED HIGHER AND HIGHER LEVELS
RobertWright_2006@111.09:123.92 AND IN FACT THAT'S ACTUALLY SUSTAINING A LONG STANDING TREND THAT PREDATES HUMAN BEINGS OK THAT BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION WAS DOING FOR US BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BEGINNING THIS STUFF ENCASES ITSELF IN A CELL
RobertWright_2006@124.36:134.85 THEN CELLS START HANGING OUT TOGETHER IN SOCIETIES EVENTUALLY THEY GET SO CLOSE THEY FORM MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS THEN YOU GET COMPLEX MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS THEY FORM SOCIETIES
RobertWright_2006@146.18:153.57 AND AMAZINGLY THAT EVOLUTION SUSTAINS THE TRAJECTORY THAT BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION HAD ESTABLISHED TOWARD GREATER COMPLEXITY
RobertWright_2006@174.43:176.46 JUST ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTS THE LITTLE ONES
RobertWright_2006@178.25:179.67 NEXT BEST THING TO A VIDEO GAME
RobertWright_2006@201.45:208.24 I'M SORRY IT WAS A CHEAP LAUGH BUT I WANTED TO FIND A WAY TO TRANSITION BACK TO THIS IDEA OF THE UNFOLDING APOCALYPSE AND I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT
RobertWright_2006@216.20:219.11 OK SO WHAT
RobertWright_2006@225.14:235.57 NOW FIRST LET ME REMIND YOU HOW MUCH WORK IT TOOK TO GET US WHERE WE ARE TO BE ON THE BRINK OF TRUE GLOBAL SOCIAL ORGANIZATION ORIGINALLY YOU HAD THE MOST COMPLEX SOCIETIES THE HUNTER GATHERER VILLAGE
RobertWright_2006@245.52:255.54 WITH THE INVENTION OF WRITING YOU START GETTING CITIES THIS IS BLURRY I KIND OF LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE A ONE CELLED ORGANISM AND REMINDS YOU HOW MANY LEVELS ORGANIC
RobertWright_2006@270.35:278.95 AND THE ROMAN EMPIRE SO YOU HAD SOCIAL COMPLEXITY SPANNING THE WHOLE CONTINENT EVEN IF NO POLITY DID SIMILARLY TODAY YOU'VE GOT NATION STATES
RobertWright_2006@279.26:286.98 POINT IS THERE'S OBVIOUSLY COLLABORATION AND ORGANIZATION GOING ON BEYOND NATIONAL BOUNDS THIS IS ACTUALLY JUST A PICTURE OF THE EARTH AT NIGHT
RobertWright_2006@287.15:296.15 I'M JUST PUTTING IT UP BECAUSE I THINK IT'S PRETTY DOES KIND OF CONVEY THE SENSE THAT THIS IS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM OK NOW
RobertWright_2006@298.02:302.18 I EXPLAINED THIS GROWTH OF COMPLEXITY BY REFERENCE TO SOMETHING CALLED NON ZERO SUMNESS
RobertWright_2006@305.36:319.65 ASSUMING THAT A FEW OF YOU DID NOT DO THE ASSIGNED READING VERY QUICKLY THE KEY IDEA IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ZERO SUM GAMES IN WHICH CORRELATIONS ARE INVERSE ALWAYS A WINNER AND A LOSER NON ZERO SUM GAMES IN WHICH CORRELATIONS
RobertWright_2006@320.06:329.60 CAN BE POSITIVE OK SO LIKE IN TENNIS USUALLY IT'S WIN LOSE IT ALWAYS ADDS UP TO ZERO ZERO SUM BUT IF YOU'RE PLAYING DOUBLES THE PERSON ON YOUR SIDE OF THE NET
RobertWright_2006@338.79:341.83 SUM BEHAVIOR IN THE REALM OF ECONOMICS AND SO ON IN EVERYDAY LIFE
RobertWright_2006@343.05:350.27 OFTEN LEADS TO COOPERATION THE ARGUMENT I MAKE IS BASICALLY THAT WELL NON ZERO SUM GAMES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PART OF LIFE YOU HAVE THEM IN HUNTER GATHERER SOCIETIES
RobertWright_2006@350.71:361.33 BUT THEN THROUGH TECHNOLOGICAL EVOLUTION NEW FORMS OF TECHNOLOGY ARISE THAT FACILITATE OR ENCOURAGE THE PLAYING OF NON ZERO SUM GAMES INVOLVING MORE PEOPLE
RobertWright_2006@361.82:371.12 OVER LARGER TERRITORY SOCIAL STRUCTURE ADAPTS TO ACCOMMODATE THIS POSSIBILITY AND TO HARNESS THIS PRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL SO YOU GET CITIES YOU KNOW AND YOU GET
RobertWright_2006@371.42:379.04 ALL THE NON ZERO SUM GAMES YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT ARE BEING PLAYED ACROSS THE WORLD LIKE HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT WHEN YOU BUY A CAR HOW MANY PEOPLE ON HOW MANY DIFFERENT CONTINENTS
RobertWright_2006@379.65:390.52 TO THE MANUFACTURE OF THAT CAR THOSE ARE PEOPLE IN EFFECT YOU'RE PLAYING A NON ZERO SUM GAME WITH I MEAN THERE ARE CERTAINLY PLENTY OF THEM AROUND NOW
RobertWright_2006@393.83:403.75 SOUNDS LIKE AN INTRINSICALLY UPBEAT WORLDVIEW IN A WAY BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK OF NON ZERO YOU THINK WIN WIN YOU KNOW THAT'S GOOD WELL THERE ARE A FEW REASONS THAT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT INTRINSICALLY
RobertWright_2006@404.15:415.01 UPBEAT FIRST OF ALL IT CAN ACCOMMODATE IT DOESN'T DENY THE EXISTENCE OF INEQUALITY EXPLOITATION WAR BUT THERE'S A MORE FUNDAMENTAL REASON THAT IT'S NOT INTRINSICALLY UPBEAT BECAUSE
RobertWright_2006@415.80:423.17 A NON ZERO SUM GAME ALL IT TELLS YOU FOR SURE IS THAT THE FORTUNES WILL BE CORRELATED FOR BETTER OR WORSE IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY PREDICT A WIN WIN OUTCOME
RobertWright_2006@426.11:436.17 SO IN A WAY THE QUESTION IS ON WHAT GROUNDS AM I UPBEAT AT ALL ABOUT HISTORY AND THE ANSWER IS FIRST OF ALL ON BALANCE I WOULD SAY PEOPLE HAVE PLAYED THEIR GAMES
RobertWright_2006@436.39:444.45 TO MORE WIN WIN OUTCOMES THAN LOSE LOSE OUTCOMES ON BALANCE I THINK HISTORY IS A NET POSITIVE IN THE NON ZERO SUM GAME DEPARTMENT
RobertWright_2006@446.86:454.69 AND A TESTAMENT TO THIS IS THE THING THAT MOST AMAZES ME MOST IMPRESSES ME AND MOST UPLIFTS ME WHICH IS THAT
RobertWright_2006@468.54:482.50 AND TREATED THEM THAT WAY AND THEN THIS MORAL REVOLUTION ARRIVED AND THEY DECIDED THAT ACTUALLY NO GREEKS ARE HUMAN BEINGS IT'S JUST THE PERSIANS WHO AREN'T FULLY HUMAN AND DON'T DESERVE TO BE TREATED VERY NICELY
RobertWright_2006@495.07:504.32 DO SOMETHING HORRENDOUS REGARDLESS OF RACE OR RELIGION AND YOU HAVE TO READ YOUR ANCIENT HISTORY TO REALIZE WHAT A REVOLUTION THAT HAS BEEN OK THIS WAS NOT A PREVALENT VIEW
RobertWright_2006@504.71:516.28 FEW THOUSAND YEARS AGO AND I ATTRIBUTE IT TO THIS NON ZERO SUM DYNAMIC I THINK THAT'S THE REASON THERE IS AS MUCH TOLERANCE TOWARD NATIONALITIES ETHNICITIES RELIGIONS AS THERE IS TODAY
RobertWright_2006@516.57:527.40 YOU KNOW IF YOU ASKED ME YOU KNOW WHY AM I NOT IN FAVOR OF BOMBING JAPAN WELL I'M ONLY HALF JOKING WHEN I SAY THEY BUILT MY CAR OK WE HAVE THIS NON ZERO SUM RELATIONSHIP AND I THINK THAT DOES LEAD TO
RobertWright_2006@527.92:541.16 A KIND OF A TOLERANCE TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU REALIZE THAT SOMEONE ELSE'S WELFARE IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH YOURS YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO CUT THEM A BREAK I KIND OF THINK THIS IS A KIND OF A BUSINESS CLASS MORALITY
RobertWright_2006@552.87:562.03 YOU KNOW BIGOTRY ABOUT RACIAL GROUPS OR ETHNIC GROUPS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FLYING TRANS ATLANTIC BUSINESS CLASS ARE DOING BUSINESS WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE THEY'RE MAKING MONEY OFF OF ALL THESE PEOPLE AND I
RobertWright_2006@562.89:572.83 REALLY DO THINK THAT IN THAT SENSE AT LEAST CAPITALISM HAS BEEN A CONSTRUCTIVE FORCE AND MORE FUNDAMENTALLY IT'S A NON ZERO SUMNESS THAT HAS BEEN A CONSTRUCTIVE FORCE
RobertWright_2006@573.22:587.22 IN EXPANDING PEOPLE 'S REALM OF MORAL AWARENESS OK I THINK THE NON ZERO SUM DYNAMIC WHICH IS NOT ONLY ECONOMIC BY ANY MEANS IT'S NOT ALWAYS COMMERCE BUT IT HAS DRIVEN US TO THE VERGE OF A MORAL TRUTH
RobertWright_2006@588.32:599.29 WHICH IS THE FUNDAMENTAL EQUALITY OF EVERYONE IT HAS DONE THAT AS IT HAS MOVED GLOBAL MOVED US TOWARD A GLOBAL LEVEL OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATION IT HAS DRIVEN US TOWARD MORAL TRUTH I THINK THAT'S WONDERFUL
RobertWright_2006@600.97:612.52 NOW BACK TO THE UNFOLDING APOCALYPSE AND YOU MAY WONDER OK THAT'S ALL FINE SOUNDS GREAT MORAL DIRECTION IN HISTORY BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS SO CALLED CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS WELL
RobertWright_2006@617.41:626.60 I WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT IT FITS INTO THE NON ZERO SUM FRAMEWORK OK IF YOU LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SO CALLED MUSLIM WORLD AND WESTERN WORLD TWO TERMS I DON'T LIKE BUT
RobertWright_2006@626.94:633.99 CAN'T REALLY AVOID IN SUCH A SHORT SPAN OF TIME THEY'RE EFFICIENT IF NOTHING ELSE IT IS NON ZERO SUM
RobertWright_2006@639.17:648.23 LESS HAPPY WITH THEIR PLACE IN THE WORLD IT'LL BE BAD FOR THE WEST IF THEY GET MORE HAPPY IT'LL BE GOOD FOR THE WEST SO THAT IS A NON ZERO SUM DYNAMIC
RobertWright_2006@649.23:662.59 AND I WOULD SAY THE NON ZERO SUM DYNAMIC IS ONLY GOING TO GROW MORE INTENSE OVER TIME BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS BUT MORE INTENSE IN A KIND OF NEGATIVE WAY IT'S THE DOWN SIDE CORRELATION OF THEIR FORTUNES THAT WILL BECOME MORE AND MORE
RobertWright_2006@663.72:672.83 POSSIBLE AND ONE REASON IS BECAUSE OF SOMETHING I CALL THE GROWING LETHALITY OF HATRED MORE AND MORE IT'S POSSIBLE FOR GRASSROOTS HATRED ABROAD
RobertWright_2006@673.09:682.95 TO MANIFEST ITSELF IN THE FORM OF ORGANIZED VIOLENCE ON AMERICAN SOIL AND THAT'S PRETTY NEW AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO GET A LOT WORSE THIS CAPACITY
RobertWright_2006@692.30:700.98 AND NANOTECHNOLOGY WE MAY BE HEARING MORE ABOUT THAT TODAY AND THERE'S SOMETHING I WORRY ABOUT ESPECIALLY WHICH IS THAT THIS DYNAMIC
RobertWright_2006@701.20:710.21 WILL LEAD TO A KIND OF A FEEDBACK CYCLE THAT PUTS US ON A SLIPPERY SLOPE WHAT I HAVE IN MIND IS TERRORISM HAPPENS HERE WE OVERREACT TO IT THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE
RobertWright_2006@711.20:720.47 SURGICAL IN OUR RETALIATION LEADS TO MORE HATRED ABROAD MORE TERRORISM WE OVERREACT BECAUSE BEING HUMAN WE FEEL LIKE RETALIATING AND IT GETS WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE
RobertWright_2006@720.73:731.63 YOU COULD CALL THIS THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK OF NEGATIVE VIBES BUT I THINK IN SOMETHING SO SPOOKY WE REALLY SHOULDN 'T HAVE THE WORD POSITIVE THERE AT ALL EVEN IN A TECHNICAL SENSE SO LET 'S CALL IT THE DEATH SPIRAL OF NEGATIVITY
RobertWright_2006@733.84:739.96 I ASSURE YOU IF IT HAPPENS AT THE END BOTH THE WEST AND THE MUSLIM WORLD WILL HAVE SUFFERED OK SO
RobertWright_2006@741.48:742.73 WE DO WELL
RobertWright_2006@743.27:753.84 FIRST OF ALL WE CAN DO A LOT MORE WITH ARMS CONTROL THE INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF DANGEROUS TECHNOLOGIES I HAVE A WHOLE GLOBAL GOVERNANCE SERMON THAT I WILL SPARE YOU RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH ANYWAY ALTHOUGH IT'S ESSENTIAL
RobertWright_2006@754.20:768.68 I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A MAJOR ROUND OF MORAL PROGRESS IN THE WORLD I THINK YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO SEE LESS HATRED AMONG GROUPS LESS BIGOTRY AND YOU KNOW RACIAL GROUPS RELIGIOUS
RobertWright_2006@769.03:780.55 WHATEVER I'VE GOT TO ADMIT I FEEL SILLY SAYING THAT IT SOUNDS SO KIND OF POLLYANNAISH I FEEL LIKE RODNEY KING YOU KNOW SAYING WHY CAN'T WE ALL JUST GET ALONG BUT HEY I DON'T REALLY SEE ANY ALTERNATIVE GIVEN THE WAY I
RobertWright_2006@780.83:792.13 THE SITUATION THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE MORAL PROGRESS OK THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE A LESSENING OF THE AMOUNT OF HATRED IN THE WORLD GIVEN HOW DANGEROUS IT'S BECOMING
RobertWright_2006@793.16:795.88 IN MY DEFENSE I'D SAY AS NAIVE AS THIS MAY SOUND
RobertWright_2006@796.52:798.69 IT'S ULTIMATELY GROUNDED IN CYNICISM
RobertWright_2006@799.31:802.41 THAT IS TO SAY THANK YOU THANK YOU
RobertWright_2006@805.17:815.66 IS TO SAY REMEMBER MY WHOLE VIEW OF MORALITY IS THAT IT BOILS DOWN TO SELF INTEREST IT'S WHEN PEOPLE 'S FORTUNES ARE CORRELATED IT'S WHEN YOUR WELFARE CONDUCES TO MINE THAT I DECIDE OH YEAH I'M ALL IN FAVOR OF YOUR WELFARE
RobertWright_2006@816.08:830.59 THAT'S WHAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS GROWTH OF THIS MORAL PROGRESS SO FAR AND I'M SAYING WE ONCE AGAIN HAVE A CORRELATION OF FORTUNES AND IF PEOPLE RESPOND TO IT INTELLIGENTLY WE WILL SEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOLERANCE
RobertWright_2006@831.04:842.77 AND SO ON THE NORMS THAT WE NEED YOU KNOW WE WILL SEE THE FURTHER EVOLUTION OF THIS KIND OF BUSINESS CLASS MORALITY SO THESE TWO THINGS YOU KNOW IF THEY GET PEOPLE 'S ATTENTION
RobertWright_2006@844.23:850.96 AND DRIVE HOME THE POSITIVE CORRELATION AND PEOPLE DO WHAT'S IN THEIR SELF INTERESTS WHICH IS FURTHER THE MORAL EVOLUTION
RobertWright_2006@851.34:860.50 THEN THEY COULD ACTUALLY HAVE A CONSTRUCTIVE EFFECT AND THAT'S WHY I LUMP GROWING LETHALITY OF HATRED AND DEATH SPIRAL OF NEGATIVITY UNDER THE GENERAL RUBRIC
RobertWright_2006@861.04:862.21 REASONS TO BE CHEERFUL
RobertWright_2006@864.16:873.86 DOING THE BEST I CAN OKAY I NEVER CALLED MYSELF MISTER UPLIFT I'M JUST DOING WHAT I CAN HERE NOW
RobertWright_2006@886.53:892.98 SPEAKING AS AN AMERICAN WHO HAS CHILDREN WHOSE SECURITY TEN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS DOWN THE ROAD I WORRY ABOUT
RobertWright_2006@893.22:900.77 WHAT I PERSONALLY WANT TO START OUT DOING IS FIGURING OUT WHY SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD HATE US OK I THINK THAT'S A WORTHY
RobertWright_2006@914.66:923.40 'S DOING THINGS YOU CONSIDER STRANGE IN A CULTURE YOU CONSIDER STRANGE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DO THE THINGS THEY DO IS A MORALLY REDEEMING
RobertWright_2006@935.16:946.17 FOR SOMEWHAT THE SAME REASONS THAT'S TRUE UNDERSTANDING AND I THINK THAT IS AN EXPANSION OF YOUR MORAL COMPASS WHEN YOU MANAGE TO DO THAT IT'S ESPECIALLY HARD TO DO WHEN PEOPLE HATE YOU
RobertWright_2006@956.67:965.47 YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY WELL YEAH I CAN KIND OF UNDERSTAND HOW A HUMAN BEING IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HATE THE COUNTRY I LIVE IN THAT'S NOT A PLEASANT THING BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT
RobertWright_2006@966.91:972.02 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET USED TO AND WORK ON NOW
RobertWright_2006@974.59:985.36 I WANT TO STRESS THAT TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE THIS WHOLE BUSINESS OF UNDERSTANDING THE GRASSROOTS THE ROOT CAUSES OF
RobertWright_2006@994.41:1002.80 THE IDEA WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THIS MORAL EXERCISE OF REALLY COMING TO APPRECIATE THEIR HUMANITY AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THEM
RobertWright_2006@1003.20:1009.90 IS PART OF AN EFFORT TO GET THEM TO APPRECIATE YOUR HUMANITY IN THE LONG RUN I THINK IT'S THE FIRST STEP TOWARD THAT THAT'S THE LONG TERM GOAL
RobertWright_2006@1011.29:1021.39 THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORRY ABOUT THIS AND IN FACT I MYSELF APPARENTLY WAS DENOUNCED ON NATIONAL TV A COUPLE OF NIGHTS AGO
RobertWright_2006@1022.78:1033.68 BECAUSE OF AN OP ED I'D WRITTEN IT WAS KIND OF ALONG THESE LINES AND THE ALLEGATION WAS THAT I HAVE QUOTE AFFECTION FOR TERRORISTS NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE PERSON WHO SAID IT WAS ANN COULTER OK
RobertWright_2006@1036.73:1038.76 IF YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE AN ENEMY DO MAKE IT
RobertWright_2006@1039.61:1042.95 BUT IT'S NOT A CRAZY CONCERN OK BECAUSE
RobertWright_2006@1052.96:1062.86 CLOSER TO ERRING ON THE SIDE OF NOT COMPREHENDING THE SITUATION CLEARLY ENOUGH THAN IN COMPREHENDING IT SO CLEARLY THAT WE JUST CAN 'T YOU KNOW GET THE ARMY OUT TO KILL TERRORISTS
RobertWright_2006@1063.19:1072.92 SO I'M NOT REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IT SO I MEAN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK ON A LOT OF FRONTS OK BUT
RobertWright_2006@1073.41:1078.45 IF WE SUCCEED IF WE SUCCEED THEN ONCE AGAIN
RobertWright_2006@1079.94:1082.81 NON ZERO SUMNESS AND THE RECOGNITION OF NON ZERO SUM
RobertWright_2006@1084.21:1091.26 WILL HAVE FORCED US TO A HIGHER MORAL LEVEL AND A KIND OF SAVING
RobertWright_2006@1091.93:1098.40 HIGHER MORAL LEVEL SOMETHING THAT KIND OF LITERALLY SAVES THE WORLD IF YOU LOOK AT THE WORD SALVATION IN THE BIBLE
RobertWright_2006@1098.94:1107.76 THE CHRISTIAN USAGE THAT WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH SAVING SOULS THAT PEOPLE GO TO HEAVEN THAT'S ACTUALLY A LATECOMER THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF THE WORD SALVATION IN THE BIBLE
RobertWright_2006@1108.11:1116.37 IS ABOUT SAVING THE SOCIAL SYSTEM YAHWEH IS OUR SAVIOR MEANS HE HAS SAVED THE NATION OF ISRAEL WHICH AT THE TIME WAS A PRETTY HIGH LEVEL SOCIAL ORGANIZATION
RobertWright_2006@1116.83:1129.41 NOW SOCIAL ORGANIZATION HAS REACHED THE GLOBAL LEVEL AND I GUESS IF THERE'S GOOD NEWS I CAN SAY I'M BRINGING YOU IT'S JUST THAT ALL THE SALVATION OF THE WORLD REQUIRES IS THE INTELLIGENT
RobertWright_2006@1130.05:1142.53 PURSUIT OF SELF INTERESTS IN A DISCIPLINED AND CAREFUL WAY IT'S GOING TO BE HARD I SAY WE GIVE IT A SHOT ANYWAY BECAUSE WE'VE JUST COME TOO FAR TO SCREW IT UP NOW
