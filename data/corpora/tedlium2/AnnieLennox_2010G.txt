AnnieLennox_2010G@15.98:26.04 SHARE WITH YOU THE STORY AS TO HOW I HAVE BECOME AN HIV AIDS CAMPAIGNER AND THIS IS THE NAME OF MY CAMPAIGN SING CAMPAIGN
AnnieLennox_2010G@26.04:44.28 IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND THREE I WAS INVITED TO TAKE PART IN THE LAUNCH OF NELSON MANDELA 'S FORTY SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR FOUNDATION THAT IS HIS HIV AIDS FOUNDATION AND FORTY SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR IS THE NUMBER THAT MANDELA HAD WHEN HE WAS IMPRISONED IN ROBBEN ISLAND
AnnieLennox_2010G@45.11:49.12 AND THAT 'S ME WITH YOUSSOU N 'DOUR ONSTAGE HAVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE
AnnieLennox_2010G@50.3:55.71 THE NEXT DAY ALL THE ARTISTS WERE INVITED TO JOIN MANDELA IN ROBBEN ISLAND
AnnieLennox_2010G@56.35:60.22 WHERE HE WAS GOING TO GIVE A CONFERENCE TO THE WORLD 'S PRESS
AnnieLennox_2010G@61.34:65.55 STANDING IN FRONT OF HIS FORMER PRISON CELL YOU CAN SEE THE BARS OF THE WINDOW THERE
AnnieLennox_2010G@66.14:71.33 IT WAS QUITE A MOMENTOUS OCCASION FOR ALL OF US IN THAT MOMENT IN TIME
AnnieLennox_2010G@71.53:73.64 MANDELA TOLD THE WORLD 'S PRESS
AnnieLennox_2010G@74.66:78.17 THAT THERE WAS A VIRTUAL GENOCIDE TAKING PLACE IN HIS COUNTRY
AnnieLennox_2010G@78.76:81.9 THAT POST APARTHEID RAINBOW NATION
AnnieLennox_2010G@82.46:89.12 A THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE DYING ON A DAILY BASIS AND THAT THE FRONT LINE VICTIMS THE MOST VULNERABLE OF ALL
AnnieLennox_2010G@92.63:96.88 THIS WAS A HUGE IMPACT ON MY MIND BECAUSE I AM A WOMAN
AnnieLennox_2010G@98.71:104.97 AND I AM A MOTHER AND I HADN 'T REALIZED THAT THE HIV AIDS PANDEMIC WAS DIRECTLY AFFECTING WOMEN IN SUCH A WAY
AnnieLennox_2010G@104.99:114.52 AND SO I COMMITTED WHEN I LEFT SOUTH AFRICA WHEN I LEFT CAPETOWN I TOLD MYSELF THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT I HAVE TO SERVE
AnnieLennox_2010G@114.6:117.86 AND SO SUBSEQUENTLY I
AnnieLennox_2010G@127.5:142.35 TALKING AND USING MY PLATFORM AS A MUSICIAN WITH MY COMMITMENT TO MANDELA OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE TREMENDOUS UNBELIEVABLE WORK THAT HE HAD DONE EVERYONE IN THE WORLD RESPECTS NELSON MANDELA EVERYONE REVERES NELSON MANDELA
AnnieLennox_2010G@142.41:147.05 BUT DO THEY ALL KNOW ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE IN SOUTH AFRICA
AnnieLennox_2010G@147.46:159.7 HIS COUNTRY THE COUNTRY THAT HAD ONE OF THE HIGHEST INCIDENTS OF TRANSMISSION OF THE VIRUS I THINK THAT IF I WENT OUT INTO THE STREET NOW AND I TOLD PEOPLE WHAT WAS HAPPENING THERE THEY WOULD BE SHOCKED
AnnieLennox_2010G@161.16:164.24 I WAS VERY VERY FORTUNATE A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER
AnnieLennox_2010G@164.57:181.68 TO HAVE MET ZACKIE ACHMAT THE FOUNDER OF TREATMENT ACTION CAMPAIGN AN INCREDIBLE CAMPAIGNER AND ACTIVIST I MET HIM AT A FORTY SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR EVENT HE WAS WEARING A T SHIRT LIKE THE ONE I WEAR NOW THIS IS A TOOL THIS TELLS YOU I AM IN SOLIDARITY WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE HIV
AnnieLennox_2010G@181.9:192.53 PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING WITH HIV AND IN A WAY BECAUSE OF THE STIGMA BY WEARING THIS T SHIRT I SAY YES WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE IT DOESN 'T HAVE TO BE IN THE CLOSET
AnnieLennox_2010G@192.92:199.87 I BECAME A MEMBER OF TREATMENT ACTION CAMPAIGN AND I 'M VERY PROUD TO BE A MEMBER OF THAT INCREDIBLE ORGANIZATION
AnnieLennox_2010G@200.15:204.8 IT 'S A GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN WITH EIGHTY PERCENT MEMBERSHIP BEING WOMEN
AnnieLennox_2010G@205.16:208.66 MOST OF WHOM ARE HIV POSITIVE
AnnieLennox_2010G@208.8:219.42 THEY WORK IN THE FIELD THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS OUTREACH TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING DIRECTLY WITH THE EFFECTS OF THE VIRUS THEY HAVE EDUCATION PROGRAMS
AnnieLennox_2010G@220.28:222.78 THEY BRING OUT THE ISSUES OF STIGMA
AnnieLennox_2010G@223.15:225.97 IT 'S QUITE EXTRAORDINARY WHAT THEY DO AND
AnnieLennox_2010G@226.16:232.83 YES MY SING CAMPAIGN HAS SUPPORTED TREATMENT ACTION CAMPAIGN IN THE WAY THAT I HAVE TRIED TO RAISE AWARENESS
AnnieLennox_2010G@244.59:262.46 SO THIS IS MY SING CAMPAIGN SING CAMPAIGN IS BASICALLY JUST ME AND ABOUT THREE OR FOUR WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO HELP TO SUPPORT ME I 'VE TRAVELED ALL OVER THE WORLD IN THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS I WENT TO ABOUT TWELVE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HERE I AM IN OSLO IN NORWAY GETTING A NICE FAT CHECK
AnnieLennox_2010G@262.66:266.71 SINGING IN HONG KONG TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO RAISE MONEY
AnnieLennox_2010G@266.71:280.89 IN JOHANNESBURG I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY TO A MAINLY WHITE MIDDLE CLASS SOUTH AFRICAN AUDIENCE WHO ENDED UP IN TEARS BECAUSE I USE FILM CLIPS THAT REALLY TOUCH THE HEART THE WHOLE NATURE OF THIS TERRIBLE TRAGEDY THAT IS TAKING PLACE THAT PEOPLE ARE
AnnieLennox_2010G@280.89:287.04 TENDING TO AVOID BECAUSE THEY ARE FATIGUED AND THEY REALLY DON 'T QUITE KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTIONS ARE
AnnieLennox_2010G@287.04:297.62 AARON MOTSOALEDI THE CURRENT HEALTH MINISTER ATTENDED THAT CONCERT AND I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH HIM AND HE GAVE HIS ABSOLUTE COMMITMENT TO TRY TO MAKING A CHANGE
AnnieLennox_2010G@297.62:299.84 WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
AnnieLennox_2010G@299.84:319.4 THIS IS IN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT I 'VE SUBSEQUENTLY BECOME AN ENVOY FOR SCOTLAND AND HIV AND I WAS SHOWING THEM MY EXPERIENCES AND TRYING TO AGAIN RAISE AWARENESS AND ONCE AGAIN IN EDINBURGH WITH THE WONDERFUL AFRICAN CHILDREN 'S CHOIR WHO I SIMPLY ADORE AND IT 'S CHILDREN LIKE THIS MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN ORPHANED BECAUSE OF THEIR
AnnieLennox_2010G@319.82:323.46 FAMILY BEING AFFECTED BY THE AIDS VIRUS
AnnieLennox_2010G@323.46:341.51 I 'M SITTING HERE IN NEW YORK WITH MICHEL SIDIBE HE 'S THE DIRECTOR OF UNAIDS AND I 'M VERY HONORED BY THE FACT THAT MICHEL INVITED ME ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO TO BECOME A UNAIDS AMBASSADOR AND IN THIS WAY I 'VE BEEN STRENGTHENING MY PLATFORM AND BROADENING MY OUTREACH
AnnieLennox_2010G@341.82:358.66 THE MESSAGE THAT UNAIDS ARE CURRENTLY SENDING OUT TO THE WORLD IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE VIRTUAL ELIMINATION OF THE TRANSMISSION OF THE VIRUS FROM MOTHER TO CHILD BY TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN IT 'S A VERY AMBITIOUS GOAL BUT WE BELIEVE IT CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH POLITICAL WILL
AnnieLennox_2010G@358.99:361.55 THIS CAN HAPPEN AND HERE I AM WITH
AnnieLennox_2010G@361.84:364.36 PREGNANT WOMAN WHO IS HIV POSITIVE

AnnieLennox_2010G@372.41:374.36 SO HER LIFE CAN BE EXTENDED
AnnieLennox_2010G@374.38:392.77 TO TAKE CARE OF THE BABY SHE 'S ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH TO AND HER BABY WILL RECEIVE PMTCT WHICH WILL MEAN THAT THAT BABY CAN BE BORN FREE OF THE VIRUS NOW THAT IS PREVENTION AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF LIFE IT 'S ONE WAY TO START LOOKING AT INTERVENTION WITH THE AIDS PANDEMIC
AnnieLennox_2010G@392.77:395.38 NOW I JUST WOULD LIKE TO FINISH OFF
