SakiMafundikwa_2013 AFRICA HAS HAD A LONG TRADITION OF DESIGN A WELL DEFINED DESIGN SENSIBILITY BUT THE PROBLEM IN AFRICA HAS BEEN THAT ESPECIALLY TODAY DESIGNERS IN AFRICA
SakiMafundikwa_2013 STRUGGLE WITH ALL FORMS OF DESIGN BECAUSE
SakiMafundikwa_2013 THEY ARE MORE APT TO LOOK OUTWARD FOR INFLUENCE AND INSPIRATION
SakiMafundikwa_2013 THE CREATIVE SPIRIT IN AFRICA THE CREATIVE TRADITION IS AS POTENT AS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN IF ONLY DESIGNERS COULD LOOK WITHIN
SakiMafundikwa_2013 THIS ETHIOPIC CROSS ILLUSTRATES WHAT DR RON EGLASH HAS ESTABLISHED THAT AFRICA HAS A LOT TO CONTRIBUTE TO COMPUTING AND MATHEMATICS THROUGH THEIR INTUITIVE GRASP OF FRACTALS AFRICANS OF ANTIQUITY CREATED CIVILIZATION
SakiMafundikwa_2013 AND THEIR MONUMENTS WHICH STILL STAND TODAY ARE A TRUE TESTIMONY OF THEIR GREATNESS
SakiMafundikwa_2013 MOST PROBABLY ONE OF HUMANITY 'S GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS IS THE INVENTION OF THE ALPHABET AND THAT HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO MESOPOTAMIA WITH THEIR INVENTION OF CUNEIFORM IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED BC FOLLOWED BY HIEROGLYPHICS IN EGYPT
