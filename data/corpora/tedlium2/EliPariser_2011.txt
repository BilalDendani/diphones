EliPariser_2011@29.16:32.09 MAY BE MORE RELEVANT TO YOUR INTERESTS RIGHT NOW
EliPariser_2011@32.11:34.43 THAN PEOPLE DYING IN AFRICA
EliPariser_2011@35:39.83 AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT A WEB BASED ON THAT IDEA OF RELEVANCE MIGHT LOOK LIKE
EliPariser_2011@40.84:60.16 SO WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN A REALLY RURAL AREA IN MAINE THE INTERNET MEANT SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT TO ME IT MEANT A CONNECTION TO THE WORLD IT MEANT SOMETHING THAT WOULD CONNECT US ALL TOGETHER AND I WAS SURE THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE GREAT FOR DEMOCRACY AND FOR OUR SOCIETY BUT THERE 'S THIS SHIFT
EliPariser_2011@60.28:62.6 IN HOW INFORMATION IS FLOWING ONLINE
EliPariser_2011@65.28:67.2 AND IT 'S INVISIBLE AND IF WE DON 'T PAY ATTENTION TO IT
EliPariser_2011@67.81:69.41 IT COULD BE A REAL PROBLEM
EliPariser_2011@70.07:75.53 SO I FIRST NOTICED THIS IN A PLACE I SPEND A LOT OF TIME MY FACEBOOK PAGE
EliPariser_2011@75.53:93.06 I 'M PROGRESSIVE POLITICALLY BIG SURPRISE BUT I 'VE ALWAYS GONE OUT OF MY WAY TO MEET CONSERVATIVES I LIKE HEARING WHAT THEY 'RE THINKING ABOUT I LIKE SEEING WHAT THEY LINK TO I LIKE LEARNING A THING OR TWO AND SO I WAS SURPRISED WHEN I NOTICED ONE DAY THAT THE CONSERVATIVES HAD DISAPPEARED FROM MY FACEBOOK FEED
EliPariser_2011@93.06:98.75 AND WHAT IT TURNED OUT WAS GOING ON WAS THAT FACEBOOK WAS LOOKING AT WHICH LINKS I CLICKED ON
EliPariser_2011@98.86:108.2 AND IT WAS NOTICING THAT ACTUALLY I WAS CLICKING MORE ON MY LIBERAL FRIENDS LINKS THAN ON MY CONSERVATIVE FRIENDS LINKS AND WITHOUT CONSULTING ME ABOUT IT
EliPariser_2011@108.41:109.98 IT HAD EDITED THEM OUT
EliPariser_2011@135:136.94 THERE ARE FIFTY SEVEN SIGNALS
EliPariser_2011@144.5:150.15 TO WHERE YOU 'RE LOCATED THAT IT USES TO PERSONALLY TAILOR YOUR QUERY RESULTS
EliPariser_2011@150.27:154.79 THINK ABOUT IT FOR A SECOND THERE IS NO STANDARD GOOGLE ANYMORE
EliPariser_2011@155.21:169.8 AND YOU KNOW THE FUNNY THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT 'S HARD TO SEE YOU CAN 'T SEE HOW DIFFERENT YOUR SEARCH RESULTS ARE FROM ANYONE ELSE 'S BUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I ASKED A BUNCH OF FRIENDS TO GOOGLE EGYPT AND TO SEND ME SCREEN SHOTS OF WHAT THEY GOT
EliPariser_2011@170.02:174.03 SO HERE 'S MY FRIEND SCOTT 'S SCREEN SHOT
EliPariser_2011@174.93:177.34 AND HERE 'S MY FRIEND DANIEL 'S SCREEN SHOT
EliPariser_2011@178.08:183.39 WHEN YOU PUT THEM SIDE BY SIDE YOU DON 'T EVEN HAVE TO READ THE LINKS TO SEE HOW DIFFERENT THESE TWO PAGES ARE
EliPariser_2011@183.84:187.25 BUT WHEN YOU DO READ THE LINKS IT 'S REALLY QUITE REMARKABLE
EliPariser_2011@198.41:215.88 THAT 'S HOW DIFFERENT THESE RESULTS ARE BECOMING SO IT 'S NOT JUST GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK EITHER THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 'S SWEEPING THE WEB THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING THIS KIND OF PERSONALIZATION YAHOO NEWS THE BIGGEST NEWS SITE ON THE INTERNET IS NOW PERSONALIZED DIFFERENT PEOPLE GET DIFFERENT THINGS
EliPariser_2011@216.75:225.5 HUFFINGTON POST THE WASHINGTON POST THE NEW YORK TIMES ALL FLIRTING WITH PERSONALIZATION IN VARIOUS WAYS AND THIS MOVES US VERY QUICKLY
EliPariser_2011@225.76:230.5 TOWARD A WORLD IN WHICH THE INTERNET IS SHOWING US WHAT IT THINKS WE WANT TO SEE
EliPariser_2011@231.18:233.81 BUT NOT NECESSARILY WHAT WE NEED TO SEE
EliPariser_2011@234.94:244.01 AS ERIC SCHMIDT SAID IT WILL BE VERY HARD FOR PEOPLE TO WATCH OR CONSUME SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT IN SOME SENSE BEEN TAILORED FOR THEM
EliPariser_2011@245.25:247.38 SO I DO THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM
EliPariser_2011@247.78:255.21 AND I THINK IF YOU TAKE ALL OF THESE FILTERS TOGETHER YOU TAKE ALL THESE ALGORITHMS YOU GET WHAT I CALL A FILTER BUBBLE
EliPariser_2011@256.11:263.28 AND YOUR FILTER BUBBLE IS YOUR OWN PERSONAL UNIQUE UNIVERSE OF INFORMATION THAT YOU LIVE IN ONLINE
EliPariser_2011@263.78:266.05 AND WHAT 'S IN YOUR FILTER BUBBLE
EliPariser_2011@266.42:269.46 DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ARE AND IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU DO
EliPariser_2011@269.91:273.3 BUT THE THING IS THAT YOU DON 'T DECIDE WHAT GETS IN
EliPariser_2011@279.09:283.54 SO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE FILTER BUBBLE WAS DISCOVERED BY SOME RESEARCHERS AT NETFLIX
EliPariser_2011@283.54:301.91 AND THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE NETFLIX QUEUES AND THEY NOTICED SOMETHING KIND OF FUNNY THAT A LOT OF US PROBABLY HAVE NOTICED WHICH IS THERE ARE SOME MOVIES THAT JUST SORT OF ZIP RIGHT UP AND OUT TO OUR HOUSES THEY ENTER THE QUEUE THEY JUST ZIP RIGHT OUT SO IRON MAN ZIPS RIGHT OUT AND WAITING FOR SUPERMAN CAN WAIT FOR A REALLY LONG TIME
EliPariser_2011@302:308.39 WHAT THEY DISCOVERED WAS THAT IN OUR NETFLIX QUEUES THERE 'S THIS EPIC STRUGGLE GOING ON
EliPariser_2011@309.25:312.77 BETWEEN OUR FUTURE ASPIRATIONAL SELVES
EliPariser_2011@312.96:315.29 AND OUR MORE IMPULSIVE PRESENT SELVES
EliPariser_2011@315.4:318.8 YOU KNOW WE ALL WANT TO BE SOMEONE WHO HAS WATCHED RASHOMON
EliPariser_2011@318.92:321.83 BUT RIGHT NOW
EliPariser_2011@322.04:325.14 WE WANT TO WATCH ACE VENTURA FOR THE FOURTH TIME
EliPariser_2011@339.02:346.83 AND THE CHALLENGE WITH THESE KINDS OF ALGORITHMIC FILTERS THESE PERSONALIZED FILTERS IS THAT BECAUSE THEY 'RE MAINLY LOOKING AT WHAT YOU CLICK ON FIRST
EliPariser_2011@352.47:359.91 AND INSTEAD OF A BALANCED INFORMATION DIET YOU CAN END UP SURROUNDED BY INFORMATION JUNK FOOD
EliPariser_2011@364.86:369.91 IN A BROADCAST SOCIETY THIS IS HOW THE FOUNDING MYTHOLOGY GOES IN A BROADCAST SOCIETY
EliPariser_2011@370.48:372.72 THERE WERE THESE GATEKEEPERS THE EDITORS
EliPariser_2011@372.89:375.27 AND THEY CONTROLLED THE FLOWS OF INFORMATION
EliPariser_2011@375.84:385.34 AND ALONG CAME THE INTERNET AND IT SWEPT THEM OUT OF THE WAY AND IT ALLOWED ALL OF US TO CONNECT TOGETHER AND IT WAS AWESOME BUT THAT 'S NOT ACTUALLY WHAT 'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW
EliPariser_2011@386.64:389.35 WHAT WE 'RE SEEING IS MORE OF A PASSING OF THE TORCH
EliPariser_2011@390.09:391.82 FROM HUMAN GATEKEEPERS
EliPariser_2011@392.04:393.71 TO ALGORITHMIC ONES
EliPariser_2011@403.73:413.87 SO IF ALGORITHMS ARE GOING TO CURATE THE WORLD FOR US IF THEY 'RE GOING TO DECIDE WHAT WE GET TO SEE AND WHAT WE DON 'T GET TO SEE THEN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY 'RE NOT JUST KEYED TO RELEVANCE
EliPariser_2011@414.32:418.11 WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ALSO SHOW US THINGS THAT ARE UNCOMFORTABLE
EliPariser_2011@418.36:427.15 OR CHALLENGING OR IMPORTANT THIS IS WHAT TED DOES OTHER POINTS OF VIEW AND THE THING IS WE 'VE ACTUALLY BEEN HERE BEFORE AS A SOCIETY
EliPariser_2011@428.85:434.76 IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN IT 'S NOT LIKE NEWSPAPERS WERE SWEATING A LOT ABOUT THEIR CIVIC RESPONSIBILITIES
EliPariser_2011@434.92:438.74 THEN PEOPLE NOTICED THAT THEY WERE DOING SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT
EliPariser_2011@439.44:447.05 THAT IN FACT YOU COULDN 'T HAVE A FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY IF CITIZENS DIDN 'T GET A GOOD FLOW OF INFORMATION
EliPariser_2011@455.24:457.56 BUT IT GOT US THROUGH THE LAST CENTURY
EliPariser_2011@458.12:460.08 AND SO NOW
EliPariser_2011@464.71:466.77 AND WE NEED THE NEW GATEKEEPERS
EliPariser_2011@467.35:470.75 TO ENCODE THAT KIND OF RESPONSIBILITY INTO THE CODE THAT THEY 'RE WRITING
EliPariser_2011@480.2:482.47 BUT WE REALLY NEED YOU TO MAKE SURE
EliPariser_2011@483.14:489.6 THAT THESE ALGORITHMS HAVE ENCODED IN THEM A SENSE OF THE PUBLIC LIFE A SENSE OF CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY
EliPariser_2011@490.28:497.18 WE NEED YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY 'RE TRANSPARENT ENOUGH THAT WE CAN SEE WHAT THE RULES ARE THAT DETERMINE WHAT GETS THROUGH OUR FILTERS
EliPariser_2011@497.34:501.33 AND WE NEED YOU TO GIVE US SOME CONTROL SO THAT WE CAN DECIDE
EliPariser_2011@501.59:503.44 WHAT GETS THROUGH AND WHAT DOESN 'T
EliPariser_2011@520.18:521.69 AND IT 'S NOT GOING TO DO THAT
EliPariser_2011@522.07:525.43 IF IT LEAVES US ALL ISOLATED IN A WEB OF ONE
EliPariser_2011@526.08:528.22 THANK YOU
