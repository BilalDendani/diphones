LizDiller_2007P ASIDE FROM KEEPING THE RAIN OUT AND PRODUCING SOME USABLE SPACE ARCHITECTURE IS NOTHING BUT A SPECIAL EFFECTS MACHINE
LizDiller_2007P THAT DELIGHTS AND DISTURBS THE SENSES OUR WORK IS ACROSS MEDIA THE WORK COMES IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES IT'S SMALL AND LARGE THIS IS
LizDiller_2007P STUFF THE THING THAT ALL THE WORK HAS IN COMMON IS THAT IT CHALLENGES THE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CONVENTIONS OF SPACE
LizDiller_2007P AND THESE ARE EVERYDAY CONVENTIONS CONVENTIONS THAT ARE SO OBVIOUS THAT WE ARE BLINDED BY THEIR FAMILIARITY AND I'VE ASSEMBLED A SAMPLING OF
LizDiller_2007P WORK THAT ALL SHARE A KIND OF PRODUCTIVE NIHILISM THAT'S USED IN THE SERVICE OF CREATING A PARTICULAR SPECIAL EFFECT AND THAT IS SOMETHING LIKE NOTHING OR SOMETHING NEXT TO NOTHING
LizDiller_2007P IT'S DONE THROUGH A FORM OF SUBTRACTION OR OBSTRUCTION OR INTERFERENCE IN A WORLD THAT WE NATURALLY
LizDiller_2007P SLEEPWALK THROUGH THIS IS AN IMAGE THAT WON US A COMPETITION FOR AN EXHIBITION PAVILION FOR THE SWISS EXPO TWO THOUSAND AND TWO ON LAKE NEUCHATEL NEAR GENEVA
LizDiller_2007P AND WE WANTED TO USE THE WATER NOT ONLY AS A CONTEXT BUT AS A PRIMARY BUILDING MATERIAL WE WANTED TO MAKE AN ARCHITECTURE OF ATMOSPHERE
LizDiller_2007P SO NO WALLS NO ROOF NO PURPOSE JUST A MASS OF ATOMIZED WATER A BIG CLOUD AND THIS PROPOSAL WAS A REACTION TO THE OVER SATURATION OF EMERGENT TECHNOLOGIES IN RECENT NATIONAL AND WORLD EXPOSITIONS
LizDiller_2007P WHICH FEEDS OR HAS BEEN FEEDING OUR INSATIABLE APPETITE FOR VISUAL STIMULATION WITH AN EVER GREATER DIGITAL VIRTUOSITY HIGH DEFINITION IN OUR OPINION HAS BECOME THE NEW ORTHODOXY
LizDiller_2007P AND WE ASK THE QUESTION CAN WE USE TECHNOLOGY HIGH TECHNOLOGY IN TO TO MAKE AN EXPO PAVILION THAT'S DECIDEDLY LOW DEFINITION
LizDiller_2007P THAT ALSO CHALLENGES THE CONVENTIONS OF SPACE AND SKIN AND RETHINKS OUR DEPENDENCE ON VISION
LizDiller_2007P SO THIS IS HOW WE SOUGHT TO DO IT WATER 'S PUMPED FROM THE LAKE AND IS FILTERED AND SHOT AS A FINE MIST THROUGH AN ARRAY OF HIGH PRESSURE FOG NOZZLES THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THEM
LizDiller_2007P AND IT PROCESSES THIS DATA IN A CENTRAL COMPUTER THAT CALIBRATES THE DEGREE OF WATER PRESSURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF WATER THROUGHOUT
LizDiller_2007P AND IT'S A RESPONSIVE SYSTEM THAT'S TRAINED ON ACTUAL WEATHER SO THIS IS JUST IN CONSTRUCTION AND
LizDiller_2007P THE INTERFACE AND BASICALLY THE SYSTEM IS KIND OF READING THE REAL WEATHER AND PRODUCING KIND OF SEMI ARTIFICIAL AND REAL WEATHER SO WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN CREATING WEATHER
LizDiller_2007P THE
LizDiller_2007P SO THIS IS AN EXHIBITION
LizDiller_2007P SUSTAINED BY
LizDiller_2007P BY THE FOG AND THIS IS VERY MUCH
LizDiller_2007P SO
LizDiller_2007P YOU KNOW ONCE DISORIENTED CAN ACTUALLY ASCEND TO THE ANGEL DECK ABOVE AND THEN JUST COME DOWN UNDER THOSE LIPS INTO THE WATER BAR SO ALL THE WATERS OF THE WORLD ARE SERVED THERE SO WE THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW AFTER BEING
LizDiller_2007P AT THE WATER AND MOVING THROUGH THE WATER AND BREATHING THE WATER YOU COULD ALSO DRINK THIS BUILDING AND
LizDiller_2007P SO IT IS SORT OF A THEME BUT IT GOES A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW DEEPER THAN THAT WE REALLY WANTED
LizDiller_2007P TO BRING OUT OUR ABSOLUTE DEPENDENCE ON THIS MASTER SENSE AND MAYBE SHARE OUR KIND OF SENSIBILITY WITH OUR OTHER SENSES YOU KNOW WHEN WE DID THIS PROJECT
LizDiller_2007P IT WAS A KIND OF TOUGH SELL BECAUSE THE SWISS SAID WELL WHY ARE WE GOING TO SPEND YOU KNOW TEN MILLION DOLLARS PRODUCING AN EFFECT THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN NATURAL ABUNDANCE THAT WE HATE
LizDiller_2007P AND YOU KNOW WE THOUGHT WELL WE TRIED TO CONVINCE THEM AND IN THE END YOU KNOW THEY ADAPTED THIS AS A NATIONAL ICON
LizDiller_2007P THAT CAME TO REPRESENT SWISS DOUBT WHICH WE YOU KNOW IT WAS KIND OF A MEANING MACHINE THAT EVERYBODY KIND OF LAID ON THEIR OWN MEANINGS OFF OF ANYWAY IT'S A TEMPORARY STRUCTURE THAT WAS ULTIMATELY DESTROYED AND SO IT'S NOW A MEMORY
LizDiller_2007P OF AN APPARITION ACTUALLY BUT IT CONTINUES TO LIVE IN EDIBLE FORM AND THIS IS THE HIGHEST HONOR TO BE BESTOWED UPON AN ARCHITECT IN SWITZERLAND
LizDiller_2007P TO HAVE A CHOCOLATE BAR ANYWAY MOVING ALONG SO IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES WE WERE MOSTLY KNOWN FOR INDEPENDENT WORK
LizDiller_2007P SUCH AS INSTALLATION ARTIST ARCHITECT COMMISSIONED PROJECTS BY MUSEUMS AND NON FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS
LizDiller_2007P AND WE DID A LOT OF MEDIA WORK ALSO A LOT OF EXPERIMENTAL THEATER PROJECTS IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE THE WHITNEY MOUNTED A RETROSPECTIVE
LizDiller_2007P OF OUR WORK THAT FEATURED A LOT OF THIS WORK FROM THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES HOWEVER THE WORK ITSELF
LizDiller_2007P RESISTED THE VERY NATURE OF A RETROSPECTIVE AND THIS IS JUST SOME OF THE STUFF THAT WAS IN THE SHOW THIS WAS A PIECE ON TOURISM
LizDiller_2007P THE PROBLEM OF THE RETROSPECTIVE WAS SOMETHING WE WERE VERY WE WERE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT'S A KIND OF INVENTION OF THE MUSEUM THAT'S SUPPOSED TO
LizDiller_2007P AND ONE OF THE RECURRING THEMES THAT BY THE WAY IN THE WORK WAS A KIND OF HOSTILITY TOWARD THE MUSEUM ITSELF
LizDiller_2007P AND WHAT YOU SEE IS ACTUALLY THE RED DOTTED LINE SHOWS THE TRACK OF THIS PERFORMING ELEMENT WHICH WAS A NEW PIECE THAT CREATED THAT WE CREATED FOR THE
LizDiller_2007P WHICH WAS A ROBOTIC DRILL BASICALLY THAT WENT ALL THE WAY AROUND CRUISED THE MUSEUM WENT ALL AROUND THE WALLS AND DID A LOT OF DAMAGE
LizDiller_2007P SO THE DRILL WAS MOUNTED ON THIS ROBOTIC ARM WE WORKED WITH BY THE WAY HONEYBEE ROBOTICS THIS IS THE BRAIN HONEYBEE ROBOTICS DESIGNED THE MARS DOCTORILLER AND IT WAS REALLY VERY
LizDiller_2007P MUCH FUN TO WORK WITH THEM THEY WEREN'T DOING THEIR PRIMARY WORK WHICH WAS FOR THE GOVERNMENT WHILE THEY WERE HELPING US WITH THIS IN ANY CASE THE WAY IT WORKS IS THAT
LizDiller_2007P AN INTELLIGENT NAVIGATOR BASICALLY MAPS THE ENTIRE SURFACE OF THESE WALLS SO UNFOLDED IT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED LINEAR FEET
LizDiller_2007P BOTH SIDES OF THE WALL ALIGNED OPENING VIEWS FROM GALLERY TO GALLERY CLUSTERS OF HOLES RANDOMLY OPENED UP SECTIONS OF WALL AND SO THIS WAS A THREE MONTH PERFORMANCE PIECE IN WHICH
LizDiller_2007P THE WALL WAS MADE INTO KIND OF AN INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE ELEMENT AND ALSO THE ACOUSTIC SEPARATION WAS DESTROYED ALSO THE VISUAL SEPARATION AND THERE WAS ALSO THIS CONSTANT
LizDiller_2007P GROAN WHICH WAS VERY ANNOYING AND THIS IS ONE OF THE BLACKOUT SPACES WHERE THERE'S A VIDEO PIECE THAT BECAME TOTALLY
LizDiller_2007P AND THIS ACOUSTICAL NUISANCE AND VISUAL NUISANCE BASICALLY EXPOSED THE DISCOMFORT OF THE WORK TO THIS ENCOMPASSING NATURE OF THE RETROSPECTIVE
LizDiller_2007P WAS REALLY GREAT WHEN IT STARTED TO BREAK UP ALL OF THE CURATORIAL TEXT MOVING ALONG TO A PROJECT THAT WE FINISHED ABOUT A YEAR AGO
LizDiller_2007P IN THE INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART IN BOSTON WHICH IS ON THE WATERFRONT AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME TO REALLY INTRODUCE THE BUILDING BUT I'LL SIMPLY SAY THAT THE BUILDING NEGOTIATES BETWEEN THIS
LizDiller_2007P OUTWARDLY FOCUSED NATURE OF THE SITE YOU KNOW IT'S A REALLY GREAT WATERFRONT SITE IN BOSTON
LizDiller_2007P AND THIS CONTRADICTORY OTHER DESIRE TO HAVE AN INWARDLY FOCUSED MUSEUM SO THE NATURE OF THE BUILDING IS THAT IT LOOKS AT LOOKING I MEAN THAT'S ITS PRIMARY OBJECTIVE BOTH ITS PROGRAM AND ITS ARCHITECTURAL CONCEIT
LizDiller_2007P THE BUILDING INCORPORATES THE SITE BUT IT DISPENSES IT IN VERY SMALL DOSES IN THE WAY THAT THE MUSEUM IS CHOREOGRAPHED SO YOU COME IN
LizDiller_2007P AND YOU'RE BASICALLY SQUEEZED BY THE THEATER BY THE BELLY OF THE THEATER INTO THIS VERY COMPRESSED SPACE WHERE THE VIEW IS TURNED OFF THEN YOU COME UP
LizDiller_2007P IN THIS GLASS ELEVATOR RIGHT NEAR THE CURTAIN WALL THIS IS THIS ELEVATOR 'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A NEW YORK CITY STUDIO APARTMENT AND THEN THIS IS A
LizDiller_2007P VIEW GOING UP AND THEN YOU COULD COME INTO THE THEATER WHICH CAN ACTUALLY DENY THE VIEW OR OPEN IT UP AND BECOME A BACKDROP AND MANY MUSICIANS CHOOSE TO USE THE
LizDiller_2007P THEATER GLASS WALLS TOTALLY OPEN THE VIEW IS DENIED IN THE GALLERIES WHERE WE JUST RECEIVE JUST NATURAL LIGHT AND THEN EXPOSED AGAIN IN THE NORTH GALLERY WITH A PANORAMIC VIEW THE ORIGINAL INTENTION OF THIS SPACE
LizDiller_2007P WHICH WAS UNFORTUNATELY NEVER REALIZED WAS TO USE LENTICULAR GLASS WHICH ALLOWED ONLY A KIND OF PERPENDICULAR VIEW OUT IN THIS VERY NARROW SPACE THAT CONNECTS EAST AND WEST GALLERIES THE INTENTION WAS REALLY TO NOT GET A CLIMAX
LizDiller_2007P BUT TO HAVE THE VIEW STALK YOU SO THE VIEW WOULD OPEN UP AS YOU WALKED FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER
LizDiller_2007P THIS WAS ELIMINATED BECAUSE THE VIEW WAS TOO GOOD AND THE MAYOR SAID NO WE JUST WANT THIS OPEN THE ARCHITECT LOST HERE BUT CULMINATING AND THAT'S WHERE THIS HOOKS INTO THE THEME OF MY LITTLE TALK
LizDiller_2007P IS THIS MEDIATHEQUE WHICH IS SUSPENDED FROM THE CANTILEVERED PORTION OF THE BUILDING SO THIS IS AN EIGHTY FOOT CANTILEVER IT'S QUITE SUBSTANTIAL SO IT'S ALREADY STICKING OUT INTO SPACE ENOUGH AND THEN FROM THAT IS THIS
LizDiller_2007P IS THIS SMALL AREA CALLED THE MEDIATHEQUE THE MEDIATHEQUE HAS SOMETHING LIKE SIXTEEN STATIONS WHERE THE PUBLIC CAN GET ONTO THE SERVER AND LOOK AT DIGITAL ARTWORKS
LizDiller_2007P OR ALSO CURATED ARTWORKS OFF THE WEB AND THIS WAS REALLY A KIND OF VERY IMPORTANT
LizDiller_2007P PART OF THIS BUILDING AND HERE IS A POINT WHERE ARCHITECTURE THIS IS LIKE TECHNOLOGY FREE ARCHITECTURE IS ONLY A FRAMING DEVICE
LizDiller_2007P IT ONLY EDITS THE HARBOR VIEW THE INDUSTRIAL HARBOR JUST THROUGH ITS WALLS ITS FLOORS AND ITS CEILING
LizDiller_2007P TO ONLY EXPOSE THE WATER ITSELF THE TEXTURE OF WATER MUCH LIKE A HYPNOTIC EFFECT CREATED BY ELECTRONIC SNOW OR A LAVA LAMP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
LizDiller_2007P AND HERE IS WHERE WE REALLY FELT THAT THERE WAS A GREAT CONVERGENCE OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL AND THE NATURAL IN THE PROJECT BUT THERE IS JUST NO INFORMATION IT'S JUST IT'S JUST HYPNOSIS
LizDiller_2007P MOVING ALONG TO LINCOLN CENTER THESE ARE THE GUYS THAT DID THE PROJECT IN THE FIRST PLACE FIFTY YEARS AGO WE'RE TAKING OVER NOW DOING WORK
LizDiller_2007P THAT RANGES IN SCALE FROM SMALL SCALE REPAIRS TO MAJOR RENOVATIONS AND MAJOR FACILITY EXPANSIONS
LizDiller_2007P BUT WE'RE DOING IT WITH A LOT LESS TESTOSTERONE THIS IS THE EXTENT OF THE WORK THAT'S TO BE COMPLETED BY TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS TALK I WANTED TO ISOLATE
LizDiller_2007P JUST A PART OF A PROJECT THAT'S EVEN A PART OF A PROJECT THAT TOUCHES A LITTLE BIT ON THIS THEME OF ARCHITECTURAL SPECIAL EFFECTS AND IT HAPPENS TO BE OUR CURRENT
LizDiller_2007P OBSESSION AND IT PLAYS A LITTLE BIT WITH THE PURGING AND ADDING OF DISTRACTION IT'S
LizDiller_2007P HALL AND IT'S TUCKED UNDER THE JUILLIARD BUILDING AND DESCENDS SEVERAL LEVELS UNDER THE STREET SO THIS IS THE ENTRANCE TO TULLY HALL AS IT USED TO BE
LizDiller_2007P AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE ASKED TO DO WAS GIVE IT A STREET IDENTITY EXPAND THE LOBBIES AND MAKE IT VISUALLY ACCESSIBLE AND THIS BUILDING WHICH IS JUST NATURALLY HERMETIC
LizDiller_2007P CANOPY THE UNDERSIDE OF THREE LEVELS OF EXPANSION OF JUILLIARD ABOUT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET CUTTING IT TO THE
LizDiller_2007P ANGLE OF BROADWAY AND THEN EXPOSING USING THAT CANOPY TO FRAME TULLY HALL BEFORE AND AFTER SHOT
LizDiller_2007P THE HALL ITSELF WHICH IS KIND OF WHERE WE'RE REALLY DOING A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF WORK SO THE HALL IS A MULTI PURPOSE HALL THE CLIENTS HAVE ASKED US TO PRODUCE A GREAT
LizDiller_2007P THEY ASKED US TO BRING AN INTIMACY HOW DO YOU BRING AN INTIMACY INTO A HALL INTIMACY FOR US MEANS A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS IT MEANS ACOUSTIC INTIMACY AND IT MEANS VISUAL INTIMACY ONE THING IS THAT THE SUBWAY IS RUNNING AND RUMBLING RIGHT UNDER THE HALL ANOTHER THING THAT COULD BE FIXED IS THE SHAPE OF THE HALL IT'S LIKE A COFFIN IT BASICALLY SENDS ALL THE SOUND
LizDiller_2007P GUTTER BALL EFFECT DOWN THE AISLES THE WALLS ARE MADE OF ABSORPTIVE SURFACE HALF ABSORPTIVE HALF REFLECTIVE WHICH IS NOT VERY GOOD FOR CONCERT SOUND THIS IS AVERY FISHER HALL
LizDiller_2007P BUT THE NOTION OF JUNK VISUAL JUNK WAS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO US TO GET RID OF VISUAL NOISE BECAUSE WE CAN'T ELIMINATE A SINGLE SEAT
LizDiller_2007P THE ARCHITECTURE IS RESTRICTED TO EIGHTEEN INCHES SO IT'S A VERY VERY THIN ARCHITECTURE FIRST WE DO A KIND OF PARTIAL BOX AND BOX SEPARATION TO TAKE AWAY THE DISTRACTION OF THE SUBWAY NOISE
LizDiller_2007P NEXT WE WRAP THE ENTIRE HALL ALMOST LIKE THIS OLIVETTI KEYBOARD WITH A MATERIAL WITH A WOOD MATERIAL THAT BASICALLY COVERS ALL THE SURFACES WALL CEILING FLOOR STAGE
LizDiller_2007P STEPS EVERYTHING BOXES BUT IT'S ACOUSTICALLY ENGINEERED TO FOCUS THE SOUND INTO THE HOUSE AND BACK TO THE STAGE AND HERE 'S AN ACOUSTIC SHELF LOOKING UP THE HALL JUST A SECTION OF THE STAGE
LizDiller_2007P JUST EVERYTHING IS LINED IT INCORPORATES EVERY SINGLE THING THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE IS TUCKED INTO THIS HIGH PERFORMANCE SKIN
LizDiller_2007P HOUSE THE AUDIENCE WITH THE PERFORMERS WE ADD ONE LITTLE DETAIL ONE PIECE OF ARCHITECTURAL EXCESS A SPECIAL EFFECT LIGHTING WE VERY STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT
LizDiller_2007P THE THEATRICS OF A CONCERT HALL IS AS MUCH IN THE SPACE OF INTERMISSION AND THE SPACE OF ARRIVAL AS IT IS
LizDiller_2007P WHEN THE CONCERT STARTS SO WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WAS PRODUCE THESE THIS EFFECT THIS LIGHTING EFFECT WHICH MADE US HAVE TO BIOENGINEER THE WOOD WALLS
LizDiller_2007P AND WHAT IT ENTAILS IS THE USE OF RESIN OF THIS VERY THICK RESIN WITH A VENEER OF THE SAME KIND OF WOOD THAT'S USED THROUGHOUT THE HALL IN A KIND OF SEAMLESS
LizDiller_2007P THAT WRAPS THE HALL IN LIGHT LIKE A BELT OF LIGHT
LizDiller_2007P RATHER THAN SEPARATING LIKE A PROSCENIUM WOULD SEPARATE THE AUDIENCE FROM PERFORMERS IT CONNECTS AUDIENCE WITH PLAYERS AND THIS IS
LizDiller_2007P A MOCKUP THAT IS IN SALT LAKE CITY THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WHAT THIS IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN FULL SCALE
LizDiller_2007P AND THIS IS A GUY FROM SALT LAKE CITY THIS IS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE
LizDiller_2007P AND FOR US I MEAN IT'S REALLY KIND OF A VERY STRANGE THING BUT THE MOMENTS IN THE HALL THAT THE BUZZ KIND OF DIES DOWN WHEN THE
LizDiller_2007P WAITING FOR THE PERFORMANCE TO BEGIN VERY SIMILAR TO THE PARTING OF CURTAINS OR THE RAISING OF A CHANDELIER THE WALLS WILL
LizDiller_2007P JUST EXUDE THIS GLOW TEMPORARILY STEALING ATTENTION FROM THE STAGE AND THIS IS TULLY IN CONSTRUCTION NOW I HAVE NO ENDING TO SAY EXCEPT THAT I'M A COUPLE OF MINUTES OVER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
