AlVernacchio_2012 TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT A WHOLE NEW WAY TO THINK ABOUT SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND SEXUALITY EDUCATION BY COMPARISON
AlVernacchio_2012 IF YOU TALK TO SOMEONE TODAY IN AMERICA ABOUT SEXUAL ACTIVITY YOU 'LL FIND PRETTY SOON YOU 'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT SEXUAL ACTIVITY YOU 'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT BASEBALL
AlVernacchio_2012 BECAUSE BASEBALL IS THE DOMINANT CULTURAL METAPHOR THAT AMERICANS USE TO THINK ABOUT AND TALK ABOUT SEXUAL ACTIVITY
AlVernacchio_2012 AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE THERE 'S ALL THIS LANGUAGE IN ENGLISH THAT SEEMS TO BE TALKING ABOUT BASEBALL BUT THAT 'S REALLY TALKING ABOUT SEXUAL ACTIVITY
AlVernacchio_2012 SO FOR EXAMPLE
AlVernacchio_2012 AND IF YOU 'RE A BENCHWARMER YOU MIGHT BE A VIRGIN OR SOMEBODY WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON ISN 'T IN THE GAME MAYBE BECAUSE OF YOUR AGE OR BECAUSE OF YOUR ABILITY
AlVernacchio_2012 OR BECAUSE OF YOUR SKILLSET
AlVernacchio_2012 A BAT 'S A PENIS AND A NAPPY DUGOUT IS A VULVA OR A VAGINA
AlVernacchio_2012 A GLOVE OR A CATCHER 'S MITT IS A CONDOM
AlVernacchio_2012 A SWITCH HITTER IS A BISEXUAL PERSON AND WE GAY AND LESBIAN FOLKS PLAY FOR THE OTHER TEAM AND THEN THERE 'S THIS ONE
AlVernacchio_2012 IF THERE 'S GRASS ON THE FIELD PLAY BALL
AlVernacchio_2012 AND THAT USUALLY REFERS TO IF A YOUNG PERSON SPECIFICALLY OFTEN A YOUNG WOMAN IS OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE PUBIC HAIR SHE 'S OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE SEX WITH
AlVernacchio_2012 THIS BASEBALL MODEL IS INCREDIBLY PROBLEMATIC IT 'S SEXIST IT 'S HETEROSEXIST IT 'S COMPETITIVE IT 'S GOAL DIRECTED AND IT CAN 'T RESULT IN HEALTHY SEXUALITY DEVELOPING IN YOUNG PEOPLE OR IN ADULTS
AlVernacchio_2012 SO WE NEED A NEW MODEL I 'M HERE TODAY TO OFFER YOU THAT NEW MODEL
AlVernacchio_2012 AND IT 'S BASED ON
AlVernacchio_2012 THE TRIGGER FOR SEXUAL ACTIVITY WHAT HAPPENS DURING SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY
AlVernacchio_2012 SO WHEN DO YOU PLAY BASEBALL
AlVernacchio_2012 YOU PLAY BASEBALL WHEN IT 'S BASEBALL SEASON AND WHEN THERE 'S A GAME ON THE SCHEDULE
AlVernacchio_2012 IT 'S NOT EXACTLY YOUR CHOICE
AlVernacchio_2012 IT 'S COMPETITIVE WE 'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER WE 'RE PLAYING AGAINST EACH OTHER AND WHEN YOU SHOW UP TO PLAY BASEBALL NOBODY NEEDS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE 'RE GOING TO DO OR HOW THIS BASEBALL GAME MIGHT BE GOOD FOR US EVERYBODY KNOWS THE RULES YOU JUST TAKE YOUR POSITION AND PLAY THE GAME
AlVernacchio_2012 BUT WHEN DO YOU HAVE PIZZA
AlVernacchio_2012 WELL YOU HAVE PIZZA
AlVernacchio_2012 WHEN YOU 'RE HUNGRY
AlVernacchio_2012 FOR PIZZA IT STARTS WITH AN INTERNAL SENSE AN INTERNAL DESIRE OR A NEED HUH I COULD GO FOR SOME PIZZA
AlVernacchio_2012 WE 'RE LOOKING FOR AN EXPERIENCE THAT BOTH OF US WILL SHARE THAT 'S SATISFYING FOR BOTH OF US
AlVernacchio_2012 AND HALF AND EVEN IF YOU 'VE HAD
AlVernacchio_2012 PIZZA WITH SOMEBODY FOR A VERY LONG TIME DON 'T YOU STILL SAY THINGS LIKE
AlVernacchio_2012 SHOULD WE GET THE USUAL LAUGHTER OR MAYBE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE ADVENTUROUS
AlVernacchio_2012 OKAY SO WHEN YOU 'RE PLAYING BASEBALL SO IF WE TALK ABOUT DURING SEXUAL ACTIVITY WHEN YOU 'RE PLAYING BASEBALL YOU 'RE JUST SUPPOSED TO ROUND THE BASES IN THE PROPER ORDER ONE AT A TIME YOU CAN 'T HIT THE BALL AND RUN TO RIGHT FIELD THAT DOESN 'T WORK AND YOU ALSO CAN 'T GET TO SECOND BASE AND SAY
AlVernacchio_2012 AND ALSO OF COURSE WITH BASEBALL THERE 'S LIKE THE SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT AND A SPECIFIC SKILL SET NOT EVERYBODY CAN PLAY BASEBALL
AlVernacchio_2012 IT 'S PRETTY EXCLUSIVE OKAY BUT WHAT ABOUT PIZZA WHEN WE 'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT 'S GOOD FOR PIZZA ISN 'T IT ALL ABOUT
AlVernacchio_2012 YOU SCORE AS MANY RUNS AS YOU CAN
AlVernacchio_2012 THERE 'S ALWAYS A WINNER IN BASEBALL
AlVernacchio_2012 AND THAT MEANS THERE 'S ALWAYS A LOSER IN BASEBALL
AlVernacchio_2012 THERE 'S NO WINNING HOW DO YOU WIN PIZZA
AlVernacchio_2012 AND SOMETIMES THAT CAN BE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OVER DIFFERENT TIMES OR WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE OR ON DIFFERENT DAYS AND WE GET TO DECIDE
AlVernacchio_2012 WHEN WE FEEL SATISFIED IF WE 'RE STILL HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE SOME MORE
AlVernacchio_2012 IF YOU EAT TOO MUCH THOUGH YOU JUST FEEL GROSS
AlVernacchio_2012 SO WHAT IF WE COULD TAKE THIS PIZZA MODEL AND OVERLAY IT ON TOP OF SEXUALITY EDUCATION A LOT OF SEXUALITY EDUCATION THAT HAPPENS TODAY IS SO INFLUENCED BY THE BASEBALL MODEL AND IT SETS UP EDUCATION THAT
AlVernacchio_2012 AND THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE BECOME OLDER PEOPLE BUT IF WE COULD CREATE SEXUALITY EDUCATION THAT WAS MORE LIKE PIZZA WE COULD CREATE EDUCATION THAT INVITES PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT THEIR OWN DESIRES TO MAKE DELIBERATE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT
AlVernacchio_2012 TO TALK ABOUT IT WITH THEIR PARTNERS AND TO ULTIMATELY LOOK FOR NOT SOME EXTERNAL OUTCOME
AlVernacchio_2012 BUT FOR WHAT FEELS SATISFYING AND WE GET TO DECIDE THAT
AlVernacchio_2012 YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED IN THE BASEBALL AND PIZZA COMPARISON UNDER THE BASEBALL IT 'S ALL COMMANDS THEY 'RE ALL EXCLAMATION POINTS
AlVernacchio_2012 BUT UNDER THE PIZZA MODEL THEY 'RE QUESTIONS
AlVernacchio_2012 AND WHO GETS TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS YOU DO
