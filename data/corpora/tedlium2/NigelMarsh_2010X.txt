NigelMarsh_2010X AND I DECIDED THAT I WOULD TRY AND TURN MY LIFE AROUND IN PARTICULAR I DECIDED I WOULD TRY TO ADDRESS THE THORNY ISSUE OF WORK LIFE BALANCE
NigelMarsh_2010X SO I STEPPED BACK
NigelMarsh_2010X AND FOUR YOUNG CHILDREN
NigelMarsh_2010X BUT ALL I LEARNED ABOUT WORK LIFE BALANCE FROM THAT YEAR
NigelMarsh_2010X WAS THAT I FOUND IT QUITE EASY TO BALANCE
NigelMarsh_2010X WORK AND LIFE WHEN I DIDN 'T HAVE ANY WORK
NigelMarsh_2010X SO I WENT BACK TO WORK
NigelMarsh_2010X AND I 'VE SPENT THESE SEVEN YEARS SINCE
NigelMarsh_2010X THE FIRST IS IF SOCIETY 'S TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS ON THIS ISSUE WE NEED AN HONEST
NigelMarsh_2010X ALL THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT
NigelMarsh_2010X ONLY SERVE TO MASK THE CORE ISSUE
NigelMarsh_2010X WHICH IS THAT CERTAIN JOB AND CAREER CHOICES
NigelMarsh_2010X ARE FUNDAMENTALLY INCOMPATIBLE
NigelMarsh_2010X WITH BEING MEANINGFULLY ENGAGED ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS WITH A YOUNG FAMILY
NigelMarsh_2010X NOW THE FIRST STEP IN SOLVING ANY PROBLEM IS ACKNOWLEDGING THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION YOU 'RE IN
NigelMarsh_2010X AND THE REALITY OF THE SOCIETY THAT WE 'RE IN
NigelMarsh_2010X LEADING LIVES OF QUIET SCREAMING DESPERATION
NigelMarsh_2010X TO ENABLE THEM TO BUY THINGS THEY DON 'T NEED TO IMPRESS PEOPLE THEY DON 'T LIKE
NigelMarsh_2010X IF YOU DON 'T DESIGN YOUR LIFE SOMEONE ELSE WILL DESIGN IT FOR YOU AND YOU MAY JUST NOT LIKE THEIR IDEA OF BALANCE
NigelMarsh_2010X IT 'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT
NigelMarsh_2010X THIS ISN 'T ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB IS IT I 'M ABOUT TO GET FIRED IT 'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU NEVER PUT THE QUALITY OF YOUR LIFE IN THE HANDS OF A COMMERCIAL CORPORATION
NigelMarsh_2010X NOW I 'M NOT TALKING HERE JUST ABOUT THE BAD COMPANIES THE ABATTOIRS OF THE HUMAN SOUL AS I CALL THEM
NigelMarsh_2010X BECAUSE COMMERCIAL COMPANIES ARE INHERENTLY DESIGNED
NigelMarsh_2010X TO GET AS MUCH OUT OF YOU AS THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH
NigelMarsh_2010X ON THE ONE HAND PUTTING CHILDCARE FACILITIES IN THE WORKPLACE IS WONDERFUL AND ENLIGHTENED
NigelMarsh_2010X ON THE OTHER HAND IT 'S A NIGHTMARE IT JUST MEANS YOU SPEND MORE TIME AT THE BLOODY OFFICE
NigelMarsh_2010X WE HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING AND ENFORCING THE BOUNDARIES THAT WE WANT IN OUR LIFE
NigelMarsh_2010X THAT WE CHOOSE UPON WHICH TO JUDGE OUR BALANCE
NigelMarsh_2010X BEFORE I WENT BACK TO WORK AFTER MY YEAR AT HOME
NigelMarsh_2010X I SAT DOWN
NigelMarsh_2010X DETAILED STEP BY STEP DESCRIPTION
NigelMarsh_2010X OF THE IDEAL BALANCED DAY THAT I ASPIRED
NigelMarsh_2010X AND IT WENT LIKE THIS
NigelMarsh_2010X DO THREE HOURS WORK
NigelMarsh_2010X DO ANOTHER THREE HOURS WORK
NigelMarsh_2010X MEET SOME MATES IN THE PUB FOR AN EARLY EVENING DRINK
NigelMarsh_2010X MEDITATE FOR HALF AN HOUR
NigelMarsh_2010X LIFE WHEN I RETIRE
NigelMarsh_2010X WHEN MY KIDS HAVE LEFT HOME WHEN MY WIFE HAS DIVORCED ME MY HEALTH IS FAILING I 'VE GOT NO MATES OR INTERESTS LEFT
NigelMarsh_2010X IN A BALANCED WAY
NigelMarsh_2010X NOW I DON 'T MEAN TO MOCK
NigelMarsh_2010X BUT BEING A FIT TEN HOUR A DAY OFFICE RAT
NigelMarsh_2010X UNDERSTAND HOW THAT CAN BE DAUNTING BUT AN INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO GAVE ME A NEW PERSPECTIVE
NigelMarsh_2010X MY WIFE WHO IS SOMEWHERE IN THE AUDIENCE
NigelMarsh_2010X AND SAID NIGEL YOU NEED TO PICK OUR YOUNGEST SON HARRY UP FROM SCHOOL
NigelMarsh_2010X WE WALKED DOWN TO THE LOCAL PARK
NigelMarsh_2010X AS I WAS WALKING OUT OF HIS BEDROOM HE SAID DAD I WENT YES MATE HE WENT DAD THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE
NigelMarsh_2010X MOREOVER I THINK IT CAN TRANSFORM SOCIETY
NigelMarsh_2010X WE CAN CHANGE SOCIETY 'S DEFINITION OF SUCCESS
NigelMarsh_2010X AWAY FROM THE MORONICALLY SIMPLISTIC NOTION THAT THE PERSON WITH THE MOST MONEY WHEN HE DIES WINS
NigelMarsh_2010X TO A MORE THOUGHTFUL AND BALANCED DEFINITION OF WHAT A LIFE WELL LIVED LOOKS LIKE
