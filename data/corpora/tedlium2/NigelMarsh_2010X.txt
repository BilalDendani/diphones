NigelMarsh_2010X@53.47:63.44 AND I DECIDED THAT I WOULD TRY AND TURN MY LIFE AROUND IN PARTICULAR I DECIDED I WOULD TRY TO ADDRESS THE THORNY ISSUE OF WORK LIFE BALANCE
NigelMarsh_2010X@64.18:66.05 SO I STEPPED BACK
NigelMarsh_2010X@71.33:73.22 AND FOUR YOUNG CHILDREN
NigelMarsh_2010X@73.92:77.3 BUT ALL I LEARNED ABOUT WORK LIFE BALANCE FROM THAT YEAR
NigelMarsh_2010X@77.45:80.66 WAS THAT I FOUND IT QUITE EASY TO BALANCE
NigelMarsh_2010X@80.69:84.98 WORK AND LIFE WHEN I DIDN 'T HAVE ANY WORK
NigelMarsh_2010X@91.86:93.73 SO I WENT BACK TO WORK
NigelMarsh_2010X@94:97.13 AND I 'VE SPENT THESE SEVEN YEARS SINCE
NigelMarsh_2010X@107.88:113.51 THE FIRST IS IF SOCIETY 'S TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS ON THIS ISSUE WE NEED AN HONEST
NigelMarsh_2010X@122.08:124.12 ALL THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT
NigelMarsh_2010X@129.24:132.3 ONLY SERVE TO MASK THE CORE ISSUE
NigelMarsh_2010X@133.06:137.4 WHICH IS THAT CERTAIN JOB AND CAREER CHOICES
NigelMarsh_2010X@137.41:140.78 ARE FUNDAMENTALLY INCOMPATIBLE
NigelMarsh_2010X@141.02:145.69 WITH BEING MEANINGFULLY ENGAGED ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS WITH A YOUNG FAMILY
NigelMarsh_2010X@148.32:153.77 NOW THE FIRST STEP IN SOLVING ANY PROBLEM IS ACKNOWLEDGING THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION YOU 'RE IN
NigelMarsh_2010X@153.89:157.18 AND THE REALITY OF THE SOCIETY THAT WE 'RE IN
NigelMarsh_2010X@161.28:164.76 LEADING LIVES OF QUIET SCREAMING DESPERATION
NigelMarsh_2010X@169.4:173.69 TO ENABLE THEM TO BUY THINGS THEY DON 'T NEED TO IMPRESS PEOPLE THEY DON 'T LIKE
NigelMarsh_2010X@207.78:215.83 IF YOU DON 'T DESIGN YOUR LIFE SOMEONE ELSE WILL DESIGN IT FOR YOU AND YOU MAY JUST NOT LIKE THEIR IDEA OF BALANCE
NigelMarsh_2010X@216.76:219.03 IT 'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT
NigelMarsh_2010X@219.55:229.1 THIS ISN 'T ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB IS IT I 'M ABOUT TO GET FIRED IT 'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU NEVER PUT THE QUALITY OF YOUR LIFE IN THE HANDS OF A COMMERCIAL CORPORATION
NigelMarsh_2010X@230.22:236.21 NOW I 'M NOT TALKING HERE JUST ABOUT THE BAD COMPANIES THE ABATTOIRS OF THE HUMAN SOUL AS I CALL THEM
NigelMarsh_2010X@241.46:245.32 BECAUSE COMMERCIAL COMPANIES ARE INHERENTLY DESIGNED
NigelMarsh_2010X@245.37:249.11 TO GET AS MUCH OUT OF YOU AS THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH
NigelMarsh_2010X@256.22:262.13 ON THE ONE HAND PUTTING CHILDCARE FACILITIES IN THE WORKPLACE IS WONDERFUL AND ENLIGHTENED
NigelMarsh_2010X@262.85:267.71 ON THE OTHER HAND IT 'S A NIGHTMARE IT JUST MEANS YOU SPEND MORE TIME AT THE BLOODY OFFICE
NigelMarsh_2010X@269.17:275.68 WE HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING AND ENFORCING THE BOUNDARIES THAT WE WANT IN OUR LIFE
NigelMarsh_2010X@283.56:286.88 THAT WE CHOOSE UPON WHICH TO JUDGE OUR BALANCE
NigelMarsh_2010X@288.17:291.91 BEFORE I WENT BACK TO WORK AFTER MY YEAR AT HOME
NigelMarsh_2010X@292.09:293.77 I SAT DOWN
NigelMarsh_2010X@295.75:299.72 DETAILED STEP BY STEP DESCRIPTION
NigelMarsh_2010X@299.78:303.82 OF THE IDEAL BALANCED DAY THAT I ASPIRED
NigelMarsh_2010X@304.87:306.44 AND IT WENT LIKE THIS
NigelMarsh_2010X@327.68:329.29 DO THREE HOURS WORK
NigelMarsh_2010X@332.79:334.3 DO ANOTHER THREE HOURS WORK
NigelMarsh_2010X@334.97:337.74 MEET SOME MATES IN THE PUB FOR AN EARLY EVENING DRINK
NigelMarsh_2010X@343.62:345.41 MEDITATE FOR HALF AN HOUR
NigelMarsh_2010X@378.71:380.4 LIFE WHEN I RETIRE
NigelMarsh_2010X@380.79:387.66 WHEN MY KIDS HAVE LEFT HOME WHEN MY WIFE HAS DIVORCED ME MY HEALTH IS FAILING I 'VE GOT NO MATES OR INTERESTS LEFT
NigelMarsh_2010X@400.76:402.4 IN A BALANCED WAY
NigelMarsh_2010X@433.57:436.29 NOW I DON 'T MEAN TO MOCK
NigelMarsh_2010X@436.78:439.85 BUT BEING A FIT TEN HOUR A DAY OFFICE RAT
NigelMarsh_2010X@473.62:480.35 UNDERSTAND HOW THAT CAN BE DAUNTING BUT AN INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO GAVE ME A NEW PERSPECTIVE
NigelMarsh_2010X@480.69:483.55 MY WIFE WHO IS SOMEWHERE IN THE AUDIENCE
NigelMarsh_2010X@486.01:490.86 AND SAID NIGEL YOU NEED TO PICK OUR YOUNGEST SON HARRY UP FROM SCHOOL
NigelMarsh_2010X@501.34:503.26 WE WALKED DOWN TO THE LOCAL PARK
NigelMarsh_2010X@531.1:539.18 AS I WAS WALKING OUT OF HIS BEDROOM HE SAID DAD I WENT YES MATE HE WENT DAD THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE
NigelMarsh_2010X@567.84:571.89 MOREOVER I THINK IT CAN TRANSFORM SOCIETY
NigelMarsh_2010X@574.49:577.87 WE CAN CHANGE SOCIETY 'S DEFINITION OF SUCCESS
NigelMarsh_2010X@578.12:583.73 AWAY FROM THE MORONICALLY SIMPLISTIC NOTION THAT THE PERSON WITH THE MOST MONEY WHEN HE DIES WINS
NigelMarsh_2010X@584.14:590.42 TO A MORE THOUGHTFUL AND BALANCED DEFINITION OF WHAT A LIFE WELL LIVED LOOKS LIKE
