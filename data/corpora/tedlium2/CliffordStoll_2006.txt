CliffordStoll_2006 HERE I'M HONORED BY THE INVITATION AND THANKS I WOULD LOVE TO TALK ABOUT STUFF THAT I'M INTERESTED IN BUT UNFORTUNATELY I SUSPECT THAT WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN WON 'T INTEREST MANY OTHER PEOPLE
CliffordStoll_2006 FIRST OFF MY BADGE SAYS I'M AN ASTRONOMER I WOULD LOVE TO TALK ABOUT MY ASTRONOMY
CliffordStoll_2006 BUT I SUSPECT THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN NON GRAY ATMOSPHERES AND POLARIZATION OF LIGHT IN JUPITER 'S UPPER ATMOSPHERE ARE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO 'D FIT IN A BUS SHELTER SO
CliffordStoll_2006 TO TALK ABOUT THAT
CliffordStoll_2006 IT WOULD BE JUST AS MUCH FUN TO TALK ABOUT SOME STUFF THAT HAPPENED
CliffordStoll_2006 I CAUGHT THE GUYS AND THEY TURNED OUT TO BE WORKING FOR WHAT WAS THEN THE SOVIET KGB AND STEALING INFORMATION AND SELLING IT AND I'D LOVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND IT
CliffordStoll_2006 BUT TWENTY YEARS
CliffordStoll_2006 LATER
CliffordStoll_2006 I FIND COMPUTER SECURITY FRANKLY TO BE KIND OF BORING IT'S TEDIOUS
CliffordStoll_2006 THE FIRST TIME YOU DO SOMETHING
CliffordStoll_2006 IT'S SCIENCE THE SECOND TIME IT'S ENGINEERING
CliffordStoll_2006 THIRD TIME IT'S JUST BEING A TECHNICIAN
CliffordStoll_2006 DO SOMETHING I DO SOMETHING ELSE
CliffordStoll_2006 SECOND BOOK NOR AM I GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHY I BELIEVE COMPUTERS DON'T BELONG IN SCHOOLS
CliffordStoll_2006 I FEEL THAT THERE'S A MASSIVE AND
CliffordStoll_2006 THE ARGUMENT IS SO OBVIOUS TO ANYONE WHO 'S HUNG AROUND A FOURTH GRADE CLASSROOM
CliffordStoll_2006 DOESN'T NEED MUCH TALKING ABOUT BUT I GUESS I MAY BE VERY WRONG ABOUT THAT AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT I'VE SAID SO DON'T GO BACK AND READ MY DISSERTATION IT PROBABLY HAS LIES IN IT AS WELL
CliffordStoll_2006 SAID THAT I OUTLINED MY TALK ABOUT
CliffordStoll_2006 FIVE MINUTES AGO AND
CliffordStoll_2006 IF YOU LOOK AT IT OVER HERE THE MAIN THING I WROTE ON MY THUMB WAS THE FUTURE I'M SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE YES
CliffordStoll_2006 RIGHT AND MY FEELING IS ASKING
CliffordStoll_2006 ME TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE IS BIZARRE BECAUSE I'VE GOT GRAY HAIR AND SO IT'S KIND OF SILLY FOR ME TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE IN FACT
CliffordStoll_2006 I THINK THAT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE 'S GOING TO BE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE FUTURE
CliffordStoll_2006 ASK A TECHNOLOGIST A SCIENTIST A PHYSICIST NO
CliffordStoll_2006 DON'T ASK SOMEBODY WHO 'S WRITING CODE
CliffordStoll_2006 NO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT SOCIETY 'S GOING TO BE LIKE IN TWENTY YEARS
CliffordStoll_2006 IN FACT DON'T ASK JUST ANY KINDERGARTEN TEACHER ASK AN EXPERIENCED ONE
CliffordStoll_2006 THE ONES WHO KNOW WHAT SOCIETY IS GOING TO BE LIKE IN ANOTHER GENERATION I
CliffordStoll_2006 NOR I SUSPECT DO MANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE WILL BRING
CliffordStoll_2006 CERTAINLY ALL OF US CAN IMAGINE THESE COOL NEW THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE THERE
CliffordStoll_2006 TO ME THINGS AREN'T THE FUTURE
CliffordStoll_2006 I ASK MYSELF IS WHAT'S SOCIETY IS GOING TO BE LIKE
CliffordStoll_2006 THE KIDS TODAY ARE PHENOMENALLY GOOD AT TEXT MESSAGING AND SPEND A HUGE AMOUNT OF ON SCREEN TIME
CliffordStoll_2006 NEVER GONE BOWLING TOGETHER
CliffordStoll_2006 HAPPENING AND THE CHANGE THAT IS HAPPENING IS NOT ONE THAT IS IN SOFTWARE BUT
CliffordStoll_2006 GOING TO TALK ABOUT I'D LOVE TO TALK ABOUT IT IT 'D BE FUN BUT
CliffordStoll_2006 I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I'M DOING NOW WHAT AM I DOING NOW OH THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IS RIGHT OVER HERE RIGHT OVER HERE
CliffordStoll_2006 IS THAT VISIBLE WHAT I'D LIKE TO TALK IS ONE SIDED THINGS
CliffordStoll_2006 I WOULD DEARLY LOVE TO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT HAVE ONE SIDE BECAUSE
CliffordStoll_2006 I LOVE MOBIUS LOOPS I NOT ONLY LOVE MOBIUS LOOPS BUT I'M ONE OF THE VERY FEW PEOPLE IF NOT THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD THAT MAKES KLEIN BOTTLES RIGHT AWAY I HOPE THAT ALL OF YOUR EYES GLAZE OVER THIS IS A KLEIN BOTTLE
CliffordStoll_2006 FOR THOSE OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE WHO KNOW YOU ROLL YOUR EYES AND SAY YUP I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT IT'S ONE SIDED IT'S A BOTTLE WHOSE INSIDE IS ITS OUTSIDE IT HAS ZERO VOLUME AND IT'S
CliffordStoll_2006 NON ORIENTABLE IT HAS WONDERFUL PROPERTIES IF YOU TAKE TWO MOBIUS LOOPS AND SEW THEIR COMMON EDGE TOGETHER YOU GET ONE OF THESE AND I MAKE THEM OUT OF GLASS AND I'D LOVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS BUT I DON'T
CliffordStoll_2006 HOWEVER THE D IN TED OF COURSE STANDS FOR DESIGN JUST
CliffordStoll_2006 TWO WEEKS AGO I MADE YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN MAKING SMALL MEDIUM AND BIG KLEIN BOTTLES FOR THE TRADE BUT
CliffordStoll_2006 WHAT I'VE JUST MADE AND I'M DELIGHTED TO SHOW YOU FIRST TIME IN PUBLIC HERE
CliffordStoll_2006 THIS IS A KLEIN BOTTLE WINE
CliffordStoll_2006 ALTHOUGH IN FOUR DIMENSIONS IT SHOULDN 'T BE ABLE TO HOLD ANY FLUID AT ALL IT'S PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF DOING SO BECAUSE OUR UNIVERSE
CliffordStoll_2006 THE COOL ONE THAT WAS A MONTH OF MY LIFE
CliffordStoll_2006 ALTHOUGH I WOULD LOVE TO TALK ABOUT TOPOLOGY
CliffordStoll_2006 I'M NOT GOING TO
CliffordStoll_2006 GOING TO MENTION MY
CliffordStoll_2006 AWAY LAST SUMMER
CliffordStoll_2006 HAD COLLECTED PHOTOGRAPHS OF ME AS MOTHERS WILL DO
CliffordStoll_2006 AND I LOOKED OVER HER ALBUM AND SHE HAD COLLECTED A PICTURE OF ME STANDING WELL SITTING IN
CliffordStoll_2006 IT SENT ME BACK SOON AFTER THAT
CliffordStoll_2006 I FOUND IN ANOTHER PICTURE THAT SHE HAD A PICTURE OF ME
CliffordStoll_2006 OVER HERE
CliffordStoll_2006 OF COURSE IS ME THIS MAN IS ROBERT MOOG
CliffordStoll_2006 THE INVENTOR OF THE MOOG SYNTHESIZER WHO PASSED AWAY THIS PAST AUGUST
CliffordStoll_2006 ROBERT MOOG WAS A GENEROUS KIND PERSON
CliffordStoll_2006 A MUSICIAN
CliffordStoll_2006 WHO TOOK TIME FROM HIS LIFE TO TEACH ME A SOPHOMORE A FRESHMAN AT SUNY BUFFALO HE'D COME UP FROM TRUMANSBURG
CliffordStoll_2006 MENTORING ME HE'D COME UP AND SPEND HOURS AND HOURS WITH ME
CliffordStoll_2006 HE WROTE A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION FOR ME TO GET INTO GRADUATE SCHOOL
CliffordStoll_2006 BOB 'S PASSING THIS PAST SUMMER HAS BEEN A LOSS TO ALL OF US
CliffordStoll_2006 ANYONE WHO 'S A MUSICIAN HAS BEEN PROFOUNDLY INFLUENCED BY
CliffordStoll_2006 SAY WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO I HOPE YOU CAN RECOGNIZE
CliffordStoll_2006 A DISTORTED SINE WAVE ALMOST A TRIANGULAR WAVE UPON THIS HEWLETT PACKARD
CliffordStoll_2006 I CAN GET TO
CliffordStoll_2006 THIS PLACE OVER HERE RIGHT
CliffordStoll_2006 KIDS KIDS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS THAT OKAY IT SAYS KIDS OVER HERE THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT
CliffordStoll_2006 FOR ME AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE A BIG ENOUGH HEAD SO I THINK LOCALLY AND I ACT LOCALLY I FEEL THAT THE BEST WAY I CAN HELP OUT
CliffordStoll_2006 IS TO HELP OUT VERY VERY LOCALLY SO PH D THIS AND DEGREE THERE AND THE
CliffordStoll_2006 HOW COME YOU AIN'T OVER HERE ON THE FRONT LINES
CliffordStoll_2006 I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT THIS IS A GOOD THING FOR EACH OF YOU TO DO NOT JUST SHOW UP TO CLASS EVERY NOW AND THEN TEACH A SOLID WEEK OKAY I'M TEACHING THREE QUARTERS TIME BUT
CliffordStoll_2006 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE DONE FOR MY SCIENCE STUDENTS IS TO TELL THEM LOOK I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU
CliffordStoll_2006 WITH MY HELP OF COURSE AND WITH THE HELP OF A VERY BEAT UP OSCILLOSCOPE MEASURED THE SPEED OF LIGHT WE WERE OFF BY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT
CliffordStoll_2006 HOW MANY EIGHTH GRADERS DO YOU KNOW OF WHO HAVE MEASURED THE SPEED OF LIGHT
CliffordStoll_2006 IN ADDITION TO THAT WE'VE MEASURED THE SPEED OF SOUND
CliffordStoll_2006 I'D LOVE TO MEASURE THE SPEED OF LIGHT HERE I WAS ALL SET TO DO IT AND I WAS THINKING AW MAN I WAS JUST GOING TO IMPOSE UPON THE POWERS THAT BE AND MEASURE THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND I'M ALL SET TO DO IT I'M ALL SET TO DO IT BUT THEN IT TURNS OUT THAT TO SET UP HERE
CliffordStoll_2006 COULD WE MEASURE THE SPEED OF LIGHT USING THE WAVE EQUATION AND ALL OF YOU KNOW THE WAVE EQUATION IS
CliffordStoll_2006 OF ANY WAVE IS A CONSTANT WHEN THE FREQUENCY GOES UP THE WAVELENGTH COMES DOWN WAVELENGTH GOES UP FREQUENCY GOES DOWN
CliffordStoll_2006 IF WE HAVE A WAVE HERE OVER HERE THAT'S WHAT'S INTERESTING
CliffordStoll_2006 WHAT THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU IN PHYSICS IN EIGHTH GRADE PHYSICS BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE AND I WISH THEY HAD WAS THAT IF YOU MULTIPLY THE FREQUENCY TIMES THE WAVELENGTH OF SOUND OR LIGHT
CliffordStoll_2006 YOU GET A CONSTANT AND THAT CONSTANT IS THE SPEED OF SOUND
CliffordStoll_2006 IS KNOW ITS FREQUENCY WELL THAT'S EASY I'VE GOT A FREQUENCY COUNTER RIGHT HERE SET IT UP TO
CliffordStoll_2006 AROUND A ABOVE A ABOVE A THERE'S AN A MORE OR LESS NOW SO I KNOW THE FREQUENCY IT'S ONE POINT SEVEN SIX
CliffordStoll_2006 NEED NOW IS TO FLIP ON ANOTHER BEAM AND THE BOTTOM BEAM IS ME TALKING RIGHT SO ANYTIME I TALK YOU'D SEE IT ON THE SCREEN
CliffordStoll_2006 OVER HERE AND AS I MOVE THIS AWAY FROM THE SOURCE YOU'LL NOTICE
CliffordStoll_2006 THE SPIRAL THE SLINKY MOVES WE'RE GOING THROUGH DIFFERENT NODES OF
CliffordStoll_2006 THE WAVE COMING OUT THIS WAY THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE PHYSICISTS I HEAR YOU ROLLING YOUR EYES BUT BEAR WITH ME TO MEASURE THE WAVELENGTH
CliffordStoll_2006 ALL I NEED TO DO IS MEASURE
CliffordStoll_2006 THE DISTANCE FROM HERE ONE FULL WAVE OVER TO HERE FROM HERE TO HERE IS THE WAVELENGTH OF SOUND SO I'LL PUT A
CliffordStoll_2006 HERE
CliffordStoll_2006 HERE
CliffordStoll_2006 LET 'S GO BACK TO MISTER
CliffordStoll_2006 THE FREQUENCY IS ONE POINT SEVEN SIX KILOHERTZ OR ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY THE WAVELENGTH WAS ZERO POINT TWO METERS
CliffordStoll_2006 LET 'S FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS IS
CliffordStoll_2006 ONE POINT SEVEN SIX
CliffordStoll_2006 ZERO POINT TWO OVER HERE IS THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO METERS PER SECOND IF YOU LOOK IT UP IN THE BOOK IT'S REALLY
CliffordStoll_2006 THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE BUT HERE WITH KLUDGY MATERIAL AND LOUSY DRINK
CliffordStoll_2006 TO MEASURE THE SPEED OF SOUND TO
CliffordStoll_2006 COMES TO WHAT I WANTED TO SAY
CliffordStoll_2006 GO BACK TO THIS PICTURE OF ME A MILLION YEARS AGO
CliffordStoll_2006 AND I'M LIKE OH MY GOD I'M STUDYING PHYSICS LANDAU LIPSCHITZ RESNICK AND HALLIDAY I'M GOING HOME FOR A MIDTERM A RIOT 'S GOING ON
CliffordStoll_2006 THERE'S A RIOT GOING ON ON CAMPUS
CliffordStoll_2006 AND THE POLICE ARE CHASING ME
CliffordStoll_2006 I'M WALKING ACROSS CAMPUS COP COMES AND LOOKS AT ME AND SAYS YOU YOU'RE A STUDENT
CliffordStoll_2006 AND A TEAR GAS CANISTER THE SIZE OF A PEPSI
CliffordStoll_2006 I GO RUNNING ACROSS CAMPUS QUICK AS I CAN I DUCK INTO
CliffordStoll_2006 BEHIND ME CLIMB UP GO PAST THIS PLACE WHERE I SEE A PENDULUM TICKING AND I'M THINKING OH YEAH THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE LENGTH IS PROPORTIONAL TO ITS PERIOD
CliffordStoll_2006 I KEEP CLIMBING UP GO
CliffordStoll_2006 BACK I GO TO A PLACE WHERE A DOWEL SPLITS OFF THERE'S A CLOCK CLOCK CLOCK CLOCK THE TIME 'S GOING BACKWARDS BECAUSE I'M INSIDE OF IT I'M THINKING OF LORENZ CONTRACTIONS AND
CliffordStoll_2006 I CLIMB UP AND THERE'S THIS PLACE WAY IN THE
CliffordStoll_2006 WHEN THEY CAST BELLS THEY WRITE INSCRIPTIONS ON THEM SO I WIPE THE PIGEON MANURE OFF ONE OF THE BELLS AND I LOOK AT IT
CliffordStoll_2006 I'M ASKING MYSELF WHY AM I HERE
CliffordStoll_2006 SO AT THIS TIME
CliffordStoll_2006 I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU THE WORDS INSCRIBED UPON THE HAYES HALL TOWER BELLS ALL TRUTH
CliffordStoll_2006 IS ONE IN
CliffordStoll_2006 SCIENCE AND RELIGION ENDEAVOR HERE FOR THE STEADY EVOLUTION OF MANKIND
CliffordStoll_2006 FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT FROM NARROWNESS TO BROAD MINDEDNESS FROM PREJUDICE TO TOLERANCE
