MickEbeling_2011A SO TEMPT IS NOW COMPLETELY PARALYZED HE ONLY HAS USE OF HIS EYES I WAS EXPOSED TO HIM I HAVE A COMPANY THAT DOES DESIGN AND ANIMATION SO OBVIOUSLY GRAFFITI IS DEFINITELY AN INTRICATE PART OF WHAT WE ADMIRE AND RESPECT IN THE ART WORLD
MickEbeling_2011A AND SO WE DECIDED THAT WE WERE GOING TO SPONSOR TONY TEMPT AND HIS CAUSE SO I WENT AND MET WITH HIS BROTHER AND FATHER AND SAID
MickEbeling_2011A AND HE SAID NO UNLESS YOU 'RE IN THE UPPER ECHELON AND YOU 'VE GOT REALLY AMAZING INSURANCE YOU CAN 'T ACTUALLY DO THAT THESE DEVICES AREN 'T ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE AND I SAID WELL HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY COMMUNICATE HAS EVERYONE SEEN THE MOVIE THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY
MickEbeling_2011A THAT 'S HOW THEY COMMUNICATE SO RUN THEIR FINGER ALONG I SAID THAT 'S ARCHAIC HOW CAN THAT BE SO I SHOWED UP WITH THE DESIRE TO JUST WRITE A CHECK
MickEbeling_2011A AND INSTEAD I WROTE A CHECK THAT I HAD NO FREAKING IDEA HOW I WAS GOING TO CASH
MickEbeling_2011A I COMMITTED TO HIS BROTHER AND HIS FATHER RIGHT THEN AND THERE I 'M LIKE ALL RIGHT HERE 'S THE DEAL TONY 'S GOING TO SPEAK WE 'RE GOING TO GET HIM A MACHINE AND WE 'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY FOR HIM TO DO HIS ART AGAIN BECAUSE IT 'S A TRAVESTY THAT SOMEONE WHO STILL HAS ALL OF THAT IN HIM ISN 'T ABLE TO COMMUNICATE IT
MickEbeling_2011A SO I SPOKE AT A CONFERENCE A COUPLE MONTHS AFTER THAT I MET THESE GUYS CALLED GRL GRAFFITI RESEARCH LAB AND THEY HAVE A TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS THEM TO PROJECT A LIGHT ONTO ANY SURFACE AND THEN WITH A LASER POINTER DRAW ON IT AND IT JUST REGISTERS THE NEGATIVE SPACE SO THEY GO AROUND AND DO ART INSTALLATIONS LIKE THIS
MickEbeling_2011A A STEPHEN HAWKING MACHINE
MickEbeling_2011A INTO OUR HOUSE MY WIFE AND KIDS AND I MOVED TO OUR BACK GARAGE AND THESE HACKERS AND PROGRAMMERS AND CONSPIRACY THEORISTS AND ANARCHISTS TOOK OVER OUR HOUSE A LOT OF OUR FRIENDS THOUGHT WE WERE ABSOLUTELY STUPID TO DO THAT AND THAT WE WERE GOING TO COME BACK AND ALL THE PICTURES ON THE WALL WOULD BE REMOVED AND GRAF ON THE WALLS BUT
MickEbeling_2011A FOR OVER TWO WEEKS WE PROGRAMMED WE WENT TO THE VENICE BOARDWALK MY KIDS GOT INVOLVED MY DOG GOT INVOLVED
MickEbeling_2011A AND WE CREATED THIS THIS IS CALLED THE EYEWRITER
MickEbeling_2011A AND YOU CAN SEE THE DESCRIPTION THIS IS A CHEAP
MickEbeling_2011A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES THAT WE BOUGHT AT THE VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK
MickEbeling_2011A SOME COPPER WIRE AND SOME STUFF FROM HOME DEPOT AND RADIO SHACK
MickEbeling_2011A WE TOOK A PS THREE CAMERA HACKED IT OPEN MOUNTED IT TO AN LED LIGHT AND NOW THERE 'S A DEVICE THAT IS
MickEbeling_2011A FREE YOU BUILD THIS YOURSELF WE PUBLISH THE CODE FOR FREE YOU DOWNLOAD THE SOFTWARE FOR FREE AND NOW WE 'VE CREATED A DEVICE THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO LIMITATIONS THERE 'S NO INSURANCE COMPANY THAT CAN SAY NO THERE 'S NO HOSPITAL THAT CAN SAY NO ANYBODY WHO 'S PARALYZED NOW HAS ACCESS TO ACTUALLY DRAW OR COMMUNICATE USING
MickEbeling_2011A AND THIS IS AN AMAZING PICTURE BECAUSE THIS IS HIS LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM AND HE 'S LOOKING OVER HIS LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM WE KICKED HIS BED SO THAT HE COULD SEE OUT AND WE SET UP A PROJECTOR ON A WALL OUT IN THE PARKING LOT OUTSIDE OF HIS HOSPITAL AND HE DREW AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FRONT OF HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THE
MickEbeling_2011A THAT 'S KIND OF OUR BATTLE CRY THAT 'S WHAT KEEPS US GOING AND KEEPS US DEVELOPING AND WE 'VE GOT SUCH A LONG WAY TO GO WITH THIS THIS IS AN AMAZING DEVICE BUT IT 'S THE EQUIVALENT OF AN ETCH A SKETCH AND SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL DESERVES SO MUCH MORE SO WE 'RE IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER FASTER STRONGER
MickEbeling_2011A THING ABOUT THIS AND THIS IS WHAT 'S COMPLETING THE
MickEbeling_2011A BASICALLY THIS IS MY POINT IF YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT 'S NOT POSSIBLE
MickEbeling_2011A NEVER DONE ANYTHING WITH OCULAR RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY BUT I JUST RECOGNIZED SOMETHING AND ASSOCIATED MYSELF WITH AMAZING PEOPLE SO THAT WE COULD MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN AND THIS IS THE QUESTION I WANT EVERYONE TO ASK YOURSELF EVERY SINGLE DAY WHEN YOU COME UP WITH SOMETHING YOU FEEL THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
MickEbeling_2011A IF NOT NOW THEN WHEN AND IF NOT ME THEN WHO THANK YOU
