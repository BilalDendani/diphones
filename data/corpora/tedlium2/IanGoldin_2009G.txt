IanGoldin_2009G SORT OF ABILITY TO DO EVERYTHING IN NEW WAYS UNLEASHES POTENTIAL NOT LEAST IN THE AREA OF MEDICINE THIS IS A STEM CELL THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED HERE IN OXFORD
IanGoldin_2009G FROM AN EMBRYONIC STEM CELL WE CAN DEVELOP ANY PART OF THE BODY INCREASINGLY OVER TIME THIS WILL BE POSSIBLE FROM OUR OWN SKIN ABLE TO REPLICATE PARTS OF THE BODY FANTASTIC POTENTIAL FOR REGENERATIVE MEDICINE
IanGoldin_2009G WHO WILL HAVE IT THE OTHER MAJOR DEVELOPMENT IS GOING TO BE IN THE AREA OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN GENETICS THE CAPACITY TO CREATE
IanGoldin_2009G AS THIS MOUSE HAS BEEN GENETICALLY MODIFIED SOMETHING WHICH GOES THREE TIMES FASTER LASTS FOR THREE TIMES LONGER WE COULD REDUCE AS THIS MOUSE CAN TO THE AGE OF OUR EQUIVALENT OF EIGHTY YEARS
IanGoldin_2009G THE BIG QUESTION FOR US IS HOW DO WE MANAGE THIS TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT IT CREATES A MORE INCLUSIVE TECHNOLOGY A TECHNOLOGY
IanGoldin_2009G WHICH MEANS THAT NOT ONLY AS WE GROW OLDER THAT WE CAN ALSO GROW WISER AND THAT WE'RE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE POPULATIONS OF THE FUTURE ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC MANIFESTATIONS OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE
