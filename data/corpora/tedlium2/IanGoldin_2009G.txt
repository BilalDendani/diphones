IanGoldin_2009G@220.30:228.95 THE BIG QUESTION FOR US IS HOW DO WE MANAGE THIS TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT IT CREATES A MORE INCLUSIVE TECHNOLOGY A TECHNOLOGY
IanGoldin_2009G@229.37:240.03 WHICH MEANS THAT NOT ONLY AS WE GROW OLDER THAT WE CAN ALSO GROW WISER AND THAT WE'RE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE POPULATIONS OF THE FUTURE ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC MANIFESTATIONS OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE

IanGoldin_2009G@325.33:333.32 OF HOW WE DEAL WITH THESE HOW WE MOBILIZE OURSELVES IN A NEW WAY AND COME TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY TO MANAGE SYSTEMIC RISK
IanGoldin_2009G@333.61:346.19 IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE INNOVATION IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE GLORY OF GLOBALIZATION COULD ALSO BE ITS DOWNFALL THIS COULD BE OUR BEST CENTURY EVER BECAUSE OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OR IT COULD BE OUR WORST
IanGoldin_2009G@360.67:371.19 THROUGH THE CREATION FOR EXAMPLE OF A BIOPATHOGEN HOW DO WE BEGIN TO WEAVE THESE TAPESTRIES TOGETHER HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT COMPLEX SYSTEMS IN NEW WAYS THAT WILL BE THE CHALLENGE OF THE SCHOLARS AND OF ALL OF US
