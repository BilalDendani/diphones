AaronKoblin_2011 DATA CAN ACTUALLY MAKE US MORE HUMAN WE 'RE COLLECTING AND CREATING ALL KINDS OF DATA ABOUT HOW WE 'RE LIVING OUR LIVES
AaronKoblin_2011 AND IT 'S ENABLING US TO TELL SOME AMAZING STORIES RECENTLY A WISE MEDIA THEORIST TWEETED THE NINETEENTH CENTURY CULTURE WAS DEFINED BY THE NOVEL THE TWENTIETH CENTURY CULTURE WAS DEFINED BY THE CINEMA AND THE CULTURE OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WILL BE DEFINED BY THE INTERFACE
AaronKoblin_2011 AND I BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO PROVE TRUE OUR LIVES ARE BEING DRIVEN BY DATA AND THE PRESENTATION OF THAT DATA IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MAKE SOME AMAZING INTERFACES THAT TELL GREAT STORIES SO I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A FEW OF THE PROJECTS THAT I 'VE BEEN WORKING ON OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THAT REFLECT ON OUR LIVES AND OUR SYSTEMS
AaronKoblin_2011 THIS IS A PROJECT CALLED FLIGHT PATTERNS WHAT YOU 'RE LOOKING AT IS AIRPLANE TRAFFIC OVER NORTH AMERICA FOR A TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD AS YOU SEE EVERYTHING STARTS TO FADE TO BLACK AND YOU SEE PEOPLE GOING TO SLEEP
AaronKoblin_2011 FOLLOWED BY THAT YOU SEE ON THE WEST COAST PLANES MOVING ACROSS THE RED EYE FLIGHTS TO THE EAST COAST AND YOU 'LL SEE EVERYBODY WAKING UP ON THE EAST COAST
AaronKoblin_2011 FOLLOWED BY EUROPEAN FLIGHTS COMING IN THE UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER EVERYBODY 'S MOVING FROM THE EAST COAST TO THE WEST COAST YOU SEE SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES START TO MAKE THEIR JOURNEYS DOWN TO HAWAII IN THE LOWER LEFT HAND CORNER I THINK IT 'S ONE THING TO SAY THERE 'S ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND PLANES BEING MONITORED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT ANY ONE TIME AND IT 'S ANOTHER THING TO SEE THAT SYSTEM AS IT EBBS AND FLOWS
AaronKoblin_2011 THIS IS A TIME LAPSE IMAGE OF THAT EXACT SAME DATA BUT I 'VE COLOR CODED IT BY TYPE SO YOU CAN SEE THE DIVERSITY OF AIRCRAFT THAT ARE IN THE SKIES ABOVE US
AaronKoblin_2011 YOU CAN ALSO TOGGLE BETWEEN ALTITUDE FOR MODEL AND MANUFACTURER SEE AGAIN THE DIVERSITY
AaronKoblin_2011 AND YOU CAN SCROLL AROUND AND SEE SOME OF THE DIFFERENT AIRPORTS AND THE DIFFERENT PATTERNS THAT THEY HAVE THIS IS SCROLLING UP THE EAST COAST YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE CHAOS THAT 'S HAPPENING IN NEW YORK WITH THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS HAVING TO DEAL WITH
AaronKoblin_2011 SO ZOOMING BACK OUT REAL QUICK WE SEE AGAIN THE U S YOU GET FLORIDA DOWN IN THE RIGHT HAND CORNER MOVING ACROSS TO THE WEST COAST YOU SEE SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES BIG LOW TRAFFIC ZONES ACROSS NEVADA AND ARIZONA AND THAT 'S US DOWN THERE IN L A AND LONG BEACH ON THE BOTTOM
AaronKoblin_2011 I STARTED TAKING A LOOK AS WELL AT DIFFERENT PERIMETERS BECAUSE YOU CAN CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT TO PULL OUT FROM THE DATA THIS IS LOOKING AT ASCENDING VERSUS DESCENDING FLIGHTS AND YOU CAN SEE OVER TIME THE WAYS THE AIRPORTS CHANGE YOU SEE THE HOLDING PATTERNS THAT START TO DEVELOP IN THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND YOU CAN SEE EVENTUALLY THE AIRPORT ACTUALLY FLIPS DIRECTIONS
AaronKoblin_2011 SO THIS IS ANOTHER PROJECT THAT I WORKED ON WITH THE SENSIBLE CITIES LAB AT MIT THIS IS VISUALIZING INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS SO IT 'S HOW NEW YORK COMMUNICATES WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL CITIES AND WE SET THIS UP AS A LIVE GLOBE IN THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART IN NEW YORK FOR THE DESIGN THE ELASTIC MIND EXHIBITION
AaronKoblin_2011 IT 'S VISUALIZING SMS MESSAGES BEING SENT IN THE CITY OF AMSTERDAM SO YOU 'RE SEEING THE DAILY EBB AND FLOW OF PEOPLE SENDING SMS MESSAGES FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CITY UNTIL WE APPROACH NEW YEAR 'S EVE WHERE EVERYBODY SAYS HAPPY NEW YEAR
AaronKoblin_2011 AND THEN YOU 'RE GOING TO SEE PEOPLE START TO GATHER IN THE CENTER OF THE CITY TO CELEBRATE THE NIGHT BEFORE WHICH HAPPENS RIGHT HERE AND THEN YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE CELEBRATING THE NEXT DAY AND YOU CAN PAUSE IT AND STEP BACK AND FORTH AND SEE DIFFERENT PHASES
AaronKoblin_2011 SO NOW ON TO SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SOME OF YOU MAY RECOGNIZE THIS THIS IS BARON WOLFGANG VON KEMPELEN 'S MECHANICAL CHESS PLAYING MACHINE AND IT 'S THIS AMAZING ROBOT THAT PLAYS CHESS EXTREMELY WELL EXCEPT FOR ONE THING IT 'S NOT A ROBOT AT ALL THERE 'S ACTUALLY A LEGLESS MAN THAT SITS IN THAT BOX AND CONTROLS THIS CHESS PLAYER
AaronKoblin_2011 THIS WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR A WEB SERVICE BY AMAZON CALLED THE MECHANICAL TURK NAMED AFTER THIS GUY AND IT 'S BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE EASY FOR PEOPLE BUT REALLY DIFFICULT FOR COMPUTERS
AaronKoblin_2011 SO THEY MADE THIS WEB SERVICE AND SAID ANY PROGRAMMER CAN WRITE A PIECE OF SOFTWARE AND TAP INTO THE MINDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THE NERDY SIDE OF ME THOUGHT WOW THIS IS AMAZING I CAN TAP INTO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 'S MINDS AND THE OTHER NERDY SIDE OF ME THOUGHT THIS IS HORRIBLE THIS IS COMPLETELY BIZARRE WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE FUTURE OF MANKIND
AaronKoblin_2011 SO I CREATED THIS DRAWING TOOL I ASKED PEOPLE TO DRAW A SHEEP FACING TO THE LEFT AND I SAID I 'LL PAY YOU TWO CENTS FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION
AaronKoblin_2011 AND I STARTED COLLECTING SHEEP AND I COLLECTED
AaronKoblin_2011 A LOT A LOT OF DIFFERENT SHEEP
AaronKoblin_2011 LOTS OF SHEEP
AaronKoblin_2011 I TOOK THE FIRST TEN THOUSAND SHEEP THAT I COLLECTED AND I PUT THEM ON A WEBSITE CALLED THESHEEPMARKET COM
AaronKoblin_2011 WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY BUY COLLECTIONS OF TWENTY SHEEP YOU CAN 'T PICK INDIVIDUAL SHEEP BUT YOU CAN BUY A SINGLE PLATE BLOCK OF STAMPS AS A COMMODITY AND JUXTAPOSED AGAINST THIS GRID YOU SEE ACTUALLY BY ROLLING OVER EACH INDIVIDUAL ONE THE HUMANITY BEHIND THIS HUGELY MECHANICAL PROCESS
AaronKoblin_2011 SO HERE 'S A FEW STATISTICS FROM THE PROJECT APPROXIMATE COLLECTION RATE OF ELEVEN SHEEP PER HOUR WHICH WOULD MAKE A WORKING WAGE OF SIXTY NINE CENTS PER HOUR
AaronKoblin_2011 THERE WERE SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO REJECTED SHEEP THAT DIDN 'T MEET SHEEP LIKE CRITERIA AND WERE THROWN OUT OF
AaronKoblin_2011 THE FLOCK LAUGHTER THE AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT DRAWING RANGED FROM FOUR SECONDS TO FORTY SIX MINUTES THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOTIVATIONS AND DEDICATION AND THERE WERE SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE PEOPLE THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROJECT OR WERE UNIQUE IP ADDRESSES SO ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE CONTRIBUTED BUT ONLY ONE OF THEM OUT OF THE SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE SAID THIS
AaronKoblin_2011 OBVIOUSLY WE THINK OF SHEEP AS FOLLOWERS AND THERE 'S THIS REFERENCE TO LE PETIT PRINCE WHERE THE NARRATOR ASKS THE PRINCE TO DRAW A SHEEP HE DRAWS SHEEP AFTER SHEEP THE NARRATOR 'S ONLY APPEASED WHEN HE DRAWS A BOX AND HE SAYS IT 'S NOT ABOUT A SCIENTIFIC RENDERING OF A SHEEP IT 'S ABOUT YOUR OWN INTERPRETATION AND DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND I LIKE THAT
AaronKoblin_2011 SO THERE WERE NO LONGER SHOE MAKERS BUT NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE SLAPPING SOLES ON PEOPLE 'S SHOES AND THE WHOLE IDEA OF ONE 'S RELATIONSHIP TO THEIR WORK CHANGED A LOT SO I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN INTERESTING CLIP TO DIVIDE INTO SIXTEEN PIECES AND FEED INTO THE MECHANICAL TURK WITH A DRAWING TOOL
AaronKoblin_2011 THIS BASICALLY ALLOWED WHAT YOU SEE ON THE LEFT SIDE IS THE ORIGINAL FRAME AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE YOU SEE THAT FRAME AS INTERPRETED BY SIXTEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS THEY 'RE DOING
AaronKoblin_2011 AND THIS WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR A PROJECT THAT I WORKED ON WITH MY FRIEND TAKASHI KAWASHIMA WE DECIDED TO USE THE MECHANICAL TURK FOR EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS MEANT FOR WHICH IS MAKING MONEY SO WE TOOK A HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL AND DIVIDED IT INTO TEN THOUSAND TEENY PIECES AND WE FED THOSE INTO THE MECHANICAL TURK
AaronKoblin_2011 WE ASKED PEOPLE TO DRAW WHAT IT WAS THAT THEY SAW BUT HERE THERE WAS NO SHEEP LIKE CRITERIA PEOPLE IF THEY DREW A STICK FIGURE OR A SMILEY FACE IT ACTUALLY MADE IT INTO THE BILL SO WHAT YOU SEE IS ACTUALLY A REPRESENTATION OF HOW WELL PEOPLE DID WHAT IT WAS THEY WERE ASKED TO DO
AaronKoblin_2011 SO WE TOOK THESE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS AND WE PUT THEM ON A WEBSITE CALLED TENTHOUSANDSCENTS COM WHERE YOU CAN BROWSE THROUGH AND SEE ALL THE INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND YOU CAN ALSO TRADE REAL HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS FOR FAKE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS AND MAKE A DONATION TO THE HUNDRED DOLLAR LAPTOP PROJECT WHICH IS NOW KNOWN AS ONE LAPTOP PER CHILD
AaronKoblin_2011 THIS IS AGAIN SHOWING ALL THE DIFFERENT CONTRIBUTIONS YOU SEE SOME PEOPLE DID BEAUTIFUL STIPPLE RENDERINGS LIKE THIS ONE ON TOP SPENT A LONG TIME MAKING REALISTIC VERSIONS AND OTHER PEOPLE WOULD DRAW STICK FIGURES OR SMILEY FACES HERE
AaronKoblin_2011 YOU MAY RECOGNIZE IT FROM TWO THOUSAND AND ONE A SPACE ODYSSEY WHEN HAL 'S DYING AT THE END OF THE FILM HE STARTS SINGING THIS SONG AS A REFERENCE TO WHEN COMPUTERS BECAME HUMAN SO WE RESYNTHESIZED THIS SONG THIS IS WHAT THAT SOUNDED LIKE WE BROKE DOWN ALL THE INDIVIDUAL NOTES IN THE SINGING AS WELL AS THE PHONEMES IN THE SINGING
AaronKoblin_2011 AND WE TOOK ALL OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL PIECES AND WE FED THEM INTO ANOTHER TURK REQUEST THIS IS WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IF YOU WENT TO THE SITE YOU TYPE IN YOUR CODE
AaronKoblin_2011 BUT YOU FIRST TEST YOUR MIC YOU 'D BE FED A SIMPLE AUDIO CLIP
AaronKoblin_2011 AFTER
AaronKoblin_2011 AND THIS WAS SEEN BY A DIRECTOR IN L A NAMED JAMES FROST WHO SAID WAIT A MINUTE YOU MEAN WE CAN SHOOT A MUSIC VIDEO WITHOUT ACTUALLY USING ANY VIDEO
AaronKoblin_2011 SO WE DID EXACTLY THAT WE MADE A MUSIC VIDEO FOR ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS RADIOHEAD AND I THINK ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS OF THIS PROJECT WAS NOT JUST SHOOTING A VIDEO WITH LASERS BUT WE ALSO OPEN SOURCED IT AND WE MADE IT RELEASED AS A GOOGLE CODE PROJECT WHERE PEOPLE COULD DOWNLOAD A BUNCH OF THE DATA AND SOME SOURCE CODE TO BUILD THEIR OWN VERSIONS OF IT AND PEOPLE WERE MAKING SOME AMAZING THINGS THIS IS ACTUALLY TWO OF MY FAVORITES THE
AaronKoblin_2011 SO WITH EVERYBODY MAKING SO MUCH AMAZING STUFF AND ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT WAS THEY WERE WORKING ON I WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN TRYING TO MAKE A COLLABORATIVE PROJECT WHERE PEOPLE WERE WORKING TOGETHER TO BUILD SOMETHING AND I MET A MUSIC VIDEO DIRECTOR NAMED CHRIS MILK AND WE STARTED BOUNCING AROUND IDEAS TO MAKE A COLLABORATIVE MUSIC VIDEO PROJECT BUT WE KNEW WE REALLY NEEDED THE RIGHT PERSON TO KIND OF RALLY BEHIND AND BUILD SOMETHING FOR
AaronKoblin_2011 SO WE PUT THE IDEA ON THE BACK BURNER FOR A FEW MONTHS AND HE ENDED UP TALKING TO RICK RUBIN WHO WAS FINISHING UP JOHNNY CASH 'S FINAL ALBUM
AaronKoblin_2011 CALLED AIN 'T NO GRAVE THE LYRICS TO THE LEADING TRACK ARE AIN 'T NO GRAVE CAN HOLD MY BODY DOWN SO WE THOUGHT THIS WAS THE PERFECT PROJECT TO BUILD A COLLABORATIVE MEMORIAL AND A VIRTUAL RESURRECTION FOR JOHNNY CASH SO I TEAMED UP WITH MY GOOD FRIEND RICARDO CABELLO ALSO KNOWN AS MR DOOB WHO 'S A MUCH BETTER PROGRAMMER THAN I AM
AaronKoblin_2011 AND HE MADE THIS AMAZING FLASH DRAWING TOOL AS YOU KNOW AN ANIMATION IS
AaronKoblin_2011 A SERIES OF IMAGES SO WHAT WE DID WAS CROSS CUT A BUNCH OF ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE OF JOHNNY CASH AND AT EIGHT FRAMES A SECOND WE ALLOWED INDIVIDUALS TO DRAW A SINGLE FRAME THAT WOULD GET WOVEN INTO THIS DYNAMICALLY CHANGING MUSIC VIDEO
AaronKoblin_2011 SO I DON 'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY THE ENTIRE THING FOR YOU BUT I WANT TO SHOW YOU TWO SHORT CLIPS ONE IS THE BEGINNING OF THE MUSIC VIDEO AND THAT 'S GOING TO BE FOLLOWED BY A SHORT CLIP OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROJECT TALKING ABOUT IT BRIEFLY
AaronKoblin_2011 YOU CAN SEE THE PERSON WHO DREW THAT INDIVIDUAL THUMBNAIL AND WHERE THEY WERE LOCATED AND IF YOU FIND ONE THAT YOU 'RE INTERESTED IN YOU CAN ACTUALLY CLICK ON IT AND OPEN UP AN INFORMATION PANEL WHERE YOU 'RE ABLE TO RATE THAT FRAME WHICH HELPS IT BUBBLE UP TO THE TOP
AaronKoblin_2011 AND THEN THIS IS AGAIN THE ABSTRACT VERSION
AaronKoblin_2011 WHICH ENDS UP GETTING A LITTLE BIT CRAZY
AaronKoblin_2011 SO THE LAST PROJECT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IS ANOTHER COLLABORATION WITH CHRIS MILK AND THIS IS CALLED THE WILDERNESS DOWNTOWN IT 'S AN ONLINE MUSIC VIDEO FOR THE ARCADE FIRE CHRIS AND I WERE REALLY AMAZED BY THE POTENTIAL NOW WITH MODERN WEB BROWSERS WHERE YOU HAVE HTML FIVE AUDIO AND VIDEO AND THE POWER OF JAVASCRIPT TO RENDER AMAZINGLY FAST
AaronKoblin_2011 BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I THINK
AaronKoblin_2011 WE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE AN EXPERIENCE THAT WAS UNLIKE THE JOHNNY CASH PROJECT WHERE YOU HAD A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME TO CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE
AaronKoblin_2011 WHAT IF WE HAD A VERY LOW COMMITMENT BUT DELIVERED SOMETHING INDIVIDUALLY UNIQUE TO EACH PERSON WHO CONTRIBUTED
AaronKoblin_2011 SO THE PROJECT STARTS OFF BY ASKING YOU TO ENTER THE ADDRESS OF THE HOME WHERE YOU GREW UP AND YOU TYPE IN THE ADDRESS IT ACTUALLY CREATES A MUSIC VIDEO SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU PULLING IN GOOGLE MAPS AND STREETVIEW IMAGES INTO THE EXPERIENCE ITSELF SO THIS SHOULD REALLY BE SEEN AT HOME WITH YOU TYPING IN YOUR OWN ADDRESS BUT I 'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE PREVIEW OF WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT
