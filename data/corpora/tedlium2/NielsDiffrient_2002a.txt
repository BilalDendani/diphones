NielsDiffrient_2002a FIVE YEARS OLD I FELL IN LOVE WITH AIRPLANES NOW I'M TALKING ABOUT THE
NielsDiffrient_2002a HAD HIGH LEATHER BOOTS JODHPURS AN OLD LEATHER JACKET A WONDERFUL HELMET AND THOSE MARVELOUS GOGGLES AND INEVITABLY A WHITE SCARF
NielsDiffrient_2002a TO FLOW IN THE WIND HE'D ALWAYS WALK UP TO HIS AIRPLANE IN A KIND OF
NielsDiffrient_2002a CIGARETTE AWAY GRAB THE GIRL
NielsDiffrient_2002a MOUNT HIS AIRPLANE MAYBE FOR THE LAST TIME OF COURSE I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF HE'D KISSED THE AIRPLANE FIRST
NielsDiffrient_2002a BUT THIS WAS REAL ROMANCE TO ME
NielsDiffrient_2002a SO AS A YOUNGSTER I TRIED TO GET CLOSE TO THIS BY DRAWING AIRPLANES CONSTANTLY DRAWING
NielsDiffrient_2002a AIRPLANES IT'S THE WAY I GOT A PART OF THIS ROMANCE AND OF COURSE IN A WAY WHEN I SAY ROMANCE
NielsDiffrient_2002a I MEAN IN PART THE AESTHETICS OF THAT WHOLE SITUATION I THINK THE WORD IS THE HOLISTIC EXPERIENCE REVOLVING AROUND A PRODUCT THE PRODUCT
NielsDiffrient_2002a WAS THAT AIRPLANE BUT IT BUILT A ROMANCE EVEN THE PARTS OF THE AIRPLANE
NielsDiffrient_2002a HAD FRENCH NAMES THE FUSELAGE THE
NielsDiffrient_2002a YOU KNOW FROM A ROMANCE LANGUAGE SO THAT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT JUST GOT INTO YOUR SPIRIT IT DID MINE AND I DECIDED I HAD TO GET CLOSER THAN JUST DRAWING
NielsDiffrient_2002a THE APPEARANCE DRAWINGS WERE NOT ENOUGH YOU COULDN'T TRANSFER THOSE TO THE MODEL ITSELF
NielsDiffrient_2002a IF YOU WANTED IT TO FLY YOU HAD TO LEARN THE DISCIPLINE OF FLYING YOU HAD TO LEARN ABOUT AERONAUTICS
NielsDiffrient_2002a I HAD TO GIVE UP THE APPROACH OF DRAWING THE FANTASY SHAPES AND CONVERT IT TO TECHNICAL DRAWINGS
NielsDiffrient_2002a THE SHAPE OF THE WING THE SHAPE OF THE FUSELAGE AND SO ON AND BUILD AN AIRPLANE OVER THESE DRAWINGS
NielsDiffrient_2002a THAT I KNEW FOLLOWED SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES OF FLYING AND IN SO DOING I COULD PRODUCE A MODEL THAT WOULD FLY
NielsDiffrient_2002a STAY IN THE AIR AND IT HAD ONCE IT WAS IN THE AIR SOME OF THIS ROMANCE THAT I WAS IN LOVE WITH WELL THE ACT OF DRAWING AIRPLANES LED ME TO
NielsDiffrient_2002a WHEN I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE A COURSE IN SCHOOL LED ME TO SIGN UP FOR AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING
NielsDiffrient_2002a AND WHEN I WAS SITTING IN CLASSES IN WHICH NO ONE ASKED ME TO DRAW AN AIRPLANE TO MY SURPRISE
NielsDiffrient_2002a I HAD TO LEARN MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS AND ALL THIS SORT OF THING I'D WILE AWAY MY TIME DRAWING AIRPLANES IN THE CLASS
NielsDiffrient_2002a ONE DAY A YOUNG MAN LOOKED OVER MY SHOULDER HE SAID YOU DRAW VERY WELL YOU SHOULD BE IN THE ART DEPARTMENT AND I SAID WHY HE SAID WELL FOR ONE THING THERE ARE MORE GIRLS THERE
NielsDiffrient_2002a SO MY ROMANCE WAS TEMPORARILY SHIFTED
NielsDiffrient_2002a AND I WENT IN TO ART BECAUSE THEY APPRECIATED DRAWING STUDIED PAINTING DIDN'T DO VERY WELL AT THAT WENT THROUGH
NielsDiffrient_2002a DESIGN SOME ARCHITECTURE EVENTUALLY HIRED MYSELF OUT AS A DESIGNER AND FOR THE FOLLOWING TWENTY FIVE YEARS
NielsDiffrient_2002a LIVING IN ITALY LIVING IN AMERICA I DOLED OUT A PIECE OF THIS ROMANCE TO ANYBODY WHO 'D PAY FOR IT
NielsDiffrient_2002a SENSE THIS AESTHETIC FEELING FOR
NielsDiffrient_2002a REVOLVING AROUND A DESIGNED OBJECT IT EXISTS ANY OF YOU WHO RODE THE AUTOMOBILES
NielsDiffrient_2002a WAS IT YESTERDAY AT THE TRACK YOU KNOW THE ROMANCE REVOLVING AROUND THOSE HIGH PERFORMANCE CARS WELL IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS
NielsDiffrient_2002a I WAS MOSTLY PUTTING OUT PIECES OF THIS ROMANCE AND NOT GETTING A LOT BACK IN BECAUSE DESIGN ON CALL
NielsDiffrient_2002a DOESN'T ALWAYS CONNECT YOU WITH A CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH YOU CAN PRODUCE THINGS OF THIS NATURE SO AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS I BEGAN TO FEEL AS THOUGH I WAS RUNNING DRY
NielsDiffrient_2002a AND I QUIT AND I STARTED UP A VERY SMALL OPERATION WENT FROM FORTY PEOPLE TO ONE
NielsDiffrient_2002a IN AN EFFORT TO REDISCOVER MY INNOCENCE I WANTED TO GET BACK WHERE THE ROMANCE WAS
NielsDiffrient_2002a I COULDN'T CHOOSE AIRPLANES BECAUSE THEY HAD GOTTEN SORT OF UNROMANTIC AT THAT POINT EVEN THOUGH I'D DONE A LOT OF AIRPLANE WORK
NielsDiffrient_2002a ON THE INTERIORS SO I CHOSE FURNITURE AND I CHOSE CHAIRS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THEM
NielsDiffrient_2002a DESIGNED A LOT OF CHAIRS OVER THE YEARS FOR TRACTORS AND TRUCKS AND SUBMARINES ALL KINDS OF THINGS
NielsDiffrient_2002a BUT NOT OFFICE CHAIRS SO I STARTED DOING THAT
NielsDiffrient_2002a AND I FOUND THAT THERE WERE WAYS TO DUPLICATE THE SAME APPROACH THAT I USED TO USE ON THE AIRPLANE ONLY THIS TIME
NielsDiffrient_2002a FOR A CHAIR YOU HAVE TO LEARN A LOT ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE BODY AND WHAT THE BODY NEEDS WANTS
NielsDiffrient_2002a I ENDED UP DESIGNING THE CHAIR I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU I SHOULD SAY ONE MORE THING WHEN I WAS DOING THOSE MODEL AIRPLANES
NielsDiffrient_2002a I DID EVERYTHING I CONCEIVED THE KIND OF AIRPLANE I BASICALLY ENGINEERED IT
NielsDiffrient_2002a I BUILT IT AND I FLEW IT AND THAT'S THE WAY I WORK NOW
NielsDiffrient_2002a WHEN I STARTED THIS CHAIR IT WAS NOT A PRECONCEIVED NOTION DESIGN NOWADAYS IF YOU MEAN IT YOU DON'T START WITH STYLING SKETCHES
NielsDiffrient_2002a I STARTED WITH A LOT OF LOOSE IDEAS ROUGHLY EIGHT OR NINE YEARS AGO AND THE LOOSE IDEAS HAD SOMETHING TO WITH WHAT I KNEW HAPPENED WITH PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE
NielsDiffrient_2002a PEOPLE WHO WORKED AND USED TASK SEATING A GREAT MANY OF THEM SITTING IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER ALL DAY LONG
NielsDiffrient_2002a AND I FELT THE ONE THING THEY DON'T NEED IS A CHAIR THAT INTERFERES WITH THEIR MAIN REASON FOR SITTING THERE
NielsDiffrient_2002a SO I TOOK THE APPROACH THAT THE CHAIR SHOULD DO AS MUCH FOR THEM AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE
NielsDiffrient_2002a OR AS MECHANISTICALLY POSSIBLE SO THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO FUSS WITH IT SO MY IDEA WAS THAT
NielsDiffrient_2002a NOW THAT MAY NOT MEAN A LOT TO SOME OF YOU BUT YOU KNOW MOST GOOD CHAIRS DO RECLINE BECAUSE IT'S BENEFICIAL TO OPEN UP THIS JOINT BETWEEN YOUR LEGS
NielsDiffrient_2002a AND YOUR UPPER BODY FOR BETTER BREATHING AND BETTER FLOW SO THAT IF YOU SIT DOWN ON MY CHAIR
NielsDiffrient_2002a TALL OR SIX FOOT SIX IT ALWAYS
NielsDiffrient_2002a DEALS WITH YOUR WEIGHT AND TRANSFERS THE AMOUNT OF FORCE REQUIRED TO RECLINE IN A WAY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING TO ADJUST
NielsDiffrient_2002a I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT UP FRONT THIS IS A TRADE OFF THERE ARE DRAWBACKS TO THIS ONE IS YOU CAN'T ACCOMMODATE EVERYBODY
NielsDiffrient_2002a BUT THE COMPROMISE I FELT WAS IN MY FAVOR BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T ADJUST THEIR CHAIRS THEY WILL SIT IN THEM FOREVER I HAD SOMEBODY
NielsDiffrient_2002a BUS OUT TO THE RACETRACK TELL ME ABOUT HIS SISTER CALLING HIM HE SAID SHE HAD ONE OF THE NEW BETTER CHAIRS SHE SAID OH I LOVE IT SHE SAID BUT IT'S TOO HIGH SO HE
NielsDiffrient_2002a COME OVER AND LOOK AT IT HE CAME OVER AND LOOKED AT IT HE REACHED DOWN HE PULLED A LEVER AND THE CHAIR SANK DOWN SHE SAID OH IT'S WONDERFUL HOW DID YOU DO THAT
NielsDiffrient_2002a SHOWED HER THE LEVER WELL THAT'S TYPICAL OF A LOT OF US WORKING IN CHAIRS AND WHY SHOULD YOU GET A TWENTY PAGE MANUAL ABOUT HOW TO RUN A CHAIR
NielsDiffrient_2002a I HAD ONE FOR A WRISTWATCH ONCE TWENTY PAGES ANYWAY I FELT THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
NielsDiffrient_2002a MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT IN ORDER TO GET THIS KIND OF ACTION THE OTHER THING I FELT WAS THAT ARMRESTS HAD NEVER REALLY BEEN
NielsDiffrient_2002a PROPERLY APPROACHED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF HOW MUCH OF HOW MUCH OF AN AIDE THEY COULD BE TO YOUR WORK LIFE
NielsDiffrient_2002a BUT I FELT IT WAS TOO MUCH TO ASK TO HAVE TO ADJUST EACH INDIVIDUAL ARM REST IN ORDER TO GET IT WHERE YOU WANTED
NielsDiffrient_2002a SO I SPENT A LONG TIME I SAID I WORKED ON EIGHT OR NINE YEARS ON IT AND EACH OF THESE THINGS WENT ALONG SORT OF IN PARALLEL BUT INCREMENTALLY WERE A PROBLEM OF THEIR OWN
NielsDiffrient_2002a I WORKED A LONG TIME ON FIGURING OUT HOW TO MOVE THE ARMS OVER A MUCH GREATER ARC THAT IS UP AND DOWN
NielsDiffrient_2002a AND MAKE THEM A LOT EASIER SO THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO USE A BUTTON AND SO AFTER MANY TRIALS MANY FAILURES
NielsDiffrient_2002a WE CAME UP WITH A VERY SIMPLE ARRANGEMENT IN WHICH WE COULD JUST MOVE ONE ARM OR THE OTHER AND THEY GO UP EASILY AND STOP WHERE YOU WANT
NielsDiffrient_2002a YOU CAN PUT THEM DOWN ESSENTIALLY OUT OF THE WAY NO ARMS AT ALL OR YOU CAN PULL THEM UP WHERE YOU WANT THEM AND THIS WAS ANOTHER THING THAT I FELT WHILE NOT NEARLY AS ROMANTIC AS CARY GRANT
NielsDiffrient_2002a NEVERTHELESS BEGINS TO GRAB A LITTLE BIT OF AESTHETIC OPERATION AESTHETIC PERFORMANCE INTO A PRODUCT
NielsDiffrient_2002a THE NEXT AREA THAT WAS OF INTEREST TO ME WAS THE FACT THAT RECLINING WAS A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR AND THE MORE YOU CAN RECLINE IN A WAY THE BETTER IT IS
NielsDiffrient_2002a THE MORE THE ANGLE BETWEEN HERE AND HERE OPENS UP AND NOWADAYS WITH A SCREEN IN FRONT OF YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE YOUR EYE DROP TOO FAR IN THE RECLINE
NielsDiffrient_2002a SO WE KEEP IT AT MORE OR LESS THE SAME LEVEL BUT YOU TRANSFER WEIGHT OFF YOUR TAILBONES
NielsDiffrient_2002a ALL THE WEIGHT OF YOUR UPPER TORSO YOUR ARMS YOUR HEAD GOES RIGHT DOWN THROUGH YOUR BACK YOUR SPINE INTO THOSE BONES WHEN YOU SIT AND THAT'S A LOT OF LOAD
NielsDiffrient_2002a JUST RELIEVING YOUR ARMS WITH ARMRESTS TAKES TWENTY PERCENT OF THAT LOAD OFF NOW THAT IF YOUR SPINE IS NOT HELD IN A GOOD POSITION
NielsDiffrient_2002a WILL HELP BEND YOUR SPINE THE WRONG WAY AND SO ON SO TO UNLOAD THAT
NielsDiffrient_2002a GREAT WEIGHT
NielsDiffrient_2002a INDEED EXISTS YOU CAN RECLINE WHEN YOU RECLINE YOU TAKE AWAY A LOT OF THAT LOAD OFF YOUR BOTTOM END AND TRANSFER IT TO YOUR BACK
NielsDiffrient_2002a THE SAME TIME AS I SAY YOU OPEN UP THIS JOINT AND BREATHABILITY IS GOOD BUT TO DO THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY
NielsDiffrient_2002a AMOUNT OF RECLINE IT GETS TO THE POINT WHERE YOU NEED A HEADREST BECAUSE NEARLY ALWAYS
NielsDiffrient_2002a YOU HAVE TO USE MUSCLE FORCE TO HOLD YOUR HEAD THERE SO THAT'S WHERE A HEADREST COMES IN NOW HEADREST IS A CHALLENGE BECAUSE YOU WANT IT TO ADJUST ENOUGH SO THAT IT WILL FIT
NielsDiffrient_2002a YOU KNOW A TALL GUY AND A SHORT GIRL SO HERE WE ARE
NielsDiffrient_2002a GOT FIVE INCHES OF ADJUSTMENT HERE
NielsDiffrient_2002a IN ORDER TO GET THE HEADREST IN THE RIGHT PLACE BUT THEN I KNEW FROM EXPERIENCE AND LOOKING AROUND IN OFFICES WHERE THERE WERE CHAIRS WITH HEADRESTS
NielsDiffrient_2002a NOBODY WOULD EVER BOTHER TO REACH BACK AND TURN A KNOB AND ADJUST THE HEADREST TO PUT IT IN POSITION AND YOU NEED IT IN A DIFFERENT POSITION WHEN YOU'RE UPRIGHT
NielsDiffrient_2002a THEN WHEN YOU'RE RECLINED SO I KNEW THAT HAD TO BE SOLVED AND HAD TO BE AUTOMATIC SO IF YOU WATCH THIS CHAIR AS I RECLINE
NielsDiffrient_2002a THE HEADREST COMES UP TO MEET MY NECK IDEALLY YOU WANT TO PUT THE HEAD SUPPORT IN
NielsDiffrient_2002a CRANIAL AREA RIGHT THERE SO THAT
NielsDiffrient_2002a PART OF IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO WORK OUT
NielsDiffrient_2002a AND PUT GEL IN THE CUSHIONS AND IN THE ARMRESTS TO ABSORB POINT LOAD DISTRIBUTES THE LOADING
NielsDiffrient_2002a SO YOU DON'T GET HARD SPOTS YOU CANT HIT YOUR ELBOW ON BOTTOM AND I DID WANT TO DEMONSTRATE THE FACT THAT THE CHAIR CAN ACCOMMODATE PEOPLE
NielsDiffrient_2002a WHILE YOU'RE SITTING IN IT YOU CAN ADJUST IT DOWN FOR THE FIVE FOOTER
NielsDiffrient_2002a OR YOU CAN ADJUST IT
NielsDiffrient_2002a FOR THE SIX FOOT SIX GUY
NielsDiffrient_2002a ALL WITHIN THE SCOPE
NielsDiffrient_2002a OF A FEW SIMPLE ADJUSTMENTS
