NielsDiffrient_2002a@13.96:20.44 FIVE YEARS OLD I FELL IN LOVE WITH AIRPLANES NOW I'M TALKING ABOUT THE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@36.03:49.71 HAD HIGH LEATHER BOOTS JODHPURS AN OLD LEATHER JACKET A WONDERFUL HELMET AND THOSE MARVELOUS GOGGLES AND INEVITABLY A WHITE SCARF
NielsDiffrient_2002a@50.53:58.20 TO FLOW IN THE WIND HE'D ALWAYS WALK UP TO HIS AIRPLANE IN A KIND OF
NielsDiffrient_2002a@64.10:67.22 CIGARETTE AWAY GRAB THE GIRL
NielsDiffrient_2002a@70.93:78.74 MOUNT HIS AIRPLANE MAYBE FOR THE LAST TIME OF COURSE I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF HE'D KISSED THE AIRPLANE FIRST
NielsDiffrient_2002a@87.39:89.43 BUT THIS WAS REAL ROMANCE TO ME
NielsDiffrient_2002a@104.26:112.27 SO AS A YOUNGSTER I TRIED TO GET CLOSE TO THIS BY DRAWING AIRPLANES CONSTANTLY DRAWING
NielsDiffrient_2002a@112.76:120.33 AIRPLANES IT'S THE WAY I GOT A PART OF THIS ROMANCE AND OF COURSE IN A WAY WHEN I SAY ROMANCE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@120.91:134.16 I MEAN IN PART THE AESTHETICS OF THAT WHOLE SITUATION I THINK THE WORD IS THE HOLISTIC EXPERIENCE REVOLVING AROUND A PRODUCT THE PRODUCT
NielsDiffrient_2002a@134.87:141.81 WAS THAT AIRPLANE BUT IT BUILT A ROMANCE EVEN THE PARTS OF THE AIRPLANE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@142.65:147.35 HAD FRENCH NAMES THE FUSELAGE THE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@150.25:161.68 YOU KNOW FROM A ROMANCE LANGUAGE SO THAT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT JUST GOT INTO YOUR SPIRIT IT DID MINE AND I DECIDED I HAD TO GET CLOSER THAN JUST DRAWING
NielsDiffrient_2002a@175.26:182.81 THE APPEARANCE DRAWINGS WERE NOT ENOUGH YOU COULDN'T TRANSFER THOSE TO THE MODEL ITSELF
NielsDiffrient_2002a@183.41:192.75 IF YOU WANTED IT TO FLY YOU HAD TO LEARN THE DISCIPLINE OF FLYING YOU HAD TO LEARN ABOUT AERONAUTICS
NielsDiffrient_2002a@209.65:218.00 I HAD TO GIVE UP THE APPROACH OF DRAWING THE FANTASY SHAPES AND CONVERT IT TO TECHNICAL DRAWINGS
NielsDiffrient_2002a@218.46:224.94 THE SHAPE OF THE WING THE SHAPE OF THE FUSELAGE AND SO ON AND BUILD AN AIRPLANE OVER THESE DRAWINGS
NielsDiffrient_2002a@225.34:234.38 THAT I KNEW FOLLOWED SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES OF FLYING AND IN SO DOING I COULD PRODUCE A MODEL THAT WOULD FLY
NielsDiffrient_2002a@234.56:246.49 STAY IN THE AIR AND IT HAD ONCE IT WAS IN THE AIR SOME OF THIS ROMANCE THAT I WAS IN LOVE WITH WELL THE ACT OF DRAWING AIRPLANES LED ME TO
NielsDiffrient_2002a@247.52:254.98 WHEN I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE A COURSE IN SCHOOL LED ME TO SIGN UP FOR AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING
NielsDiffrient_2002a@256.11:264.53 AND WHEN I WAS SITTING IN CLASSES IN WHICH NO ONE ASKED ME TO DRAW AN AIRPLANE TO MY SURPRISE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@265.14:273.20 I HAD TO LEARN MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS AND ALL THIS SORT OF THING I'D WILE AWAY MY TIME DRAWING AIRPLANES IN THE CLASS
NielsDiffrient_2002a@273.96:286.15 ONE DAY A YOUNG MAN LOOKED OVER MY SHOULDER HE SAID YOU DRAW VERY WELL YOU SHOULD BE IN THE ART DEPARTMENT AND I SAID WHY HE SAID WELL FOR ONE THING THERE ARE MORE GIRLS THERE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@290.20:293.55 SO MY ROMANCE WAS TEMPORARILY SHIFTED
NielsDiffrient_2002a@294.69:302.88 AND I WENT IN TO ART BECAUSE THEY APPRECIATED DRAWING STUDIED PAINTING DIDN'T DO VERY WELL AT THAT WENT THROUGH
NielsDiffrient_2002a@303.57:312.09 DESIGN SOME ARCHITECTURE EVENTUALLY HIRED MYSELF OUT AS A DESIGNER AND FOR THE FOLLOWING TWENTY FIVE YEARS
NielsDiffrient_2002a@312.79:322.56 LIVING IN ITALY LIVING IN AMERICA I DOLED OUT A PIECE OF THIS ROMANCE TO ANYBODY WHO 'D PAY FOR IT
NielsDiffrient_2002a@324.07:327.77 SENSE THIS AESTHETIC FEELING FOR
NielsDiffrient_2002a@329.44:338.20 REVOLVING AROUND A DESIGNED OBJECT IT EXISTS ANY OF YOU WHO RODE THE AUTOMOBILES
NielsDiffrient_2002a@339.16:351.47 WAS IT YESTERDAY AT THE TRACK YOU KNOW THE ROMANCE REVOLVING AROUND THOSE HIGH PERFORMANCE CARS WELL IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS
NielsDiffrient_2002a@352.52:360.08 I WAS MOSTLY PUTTING OUT PIECES OF THIS ROMANCE AND NOT GETTING A LOT BACK IN BECAUSE DESIGN ON CALL
NielsDiffrient_2002a@360.70:371.14 DOESN'T ALWAYS CONNECT YOU WITH A CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH YOU CAN PRODUCE THINGS OF THIS NATURE SO AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS I BEGAN TO FEEL AS THOUGH I WAS RUNNING DRY
NielsDiffrient_2002a@372.34:380.63 AND I QUIT AND I STARTED UP A VERY SMALL OPERATION WENT FROM FORTY PEOPLE TO ONE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@381.92:389.61 IN AN EFFORT TO REDISCOVER MY INNOCENCE I WANTED TO GET BACK WHERE THE ROMANCE WAS
NielsDiffrient_2002a@391.02:399.59 I COULDN'T CHOOSE AIRPLANES BECAUSE THEY HAD GOTTEN SORT OF UNROMANTIC AT THAT POINT EVEN THOUGH I'D DONE A LOT OF AIRPLANE WORK
NielsDiffrient_2002a@399.96:409.49 ON THE INTERIORS SO I CHOSE FURNITURE AND I CHOSE CHAIRS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THEM
NielsDiffrient_2002a@410.27:420.05 DESIGNED A LOT OF CHAIRS OVER THE YEARS FOR TRACTORS AND TRUCKS AND SUBMARINES ALL KINDS OF THINGS
NielsDiffrient_2002a@420.52:423.51 BUT NOT OFFICE CHAIRS SO I STARTED DOING THAT
NielsDiffrient_2002a@424.48:435.14 AND I FOUND THAT THERE WERE WAYS TO DUPLICATE THE SAME APPROACH THAT I USED TO USE ON THE AIRPLANE ONLY THIS TIME
NielsDiffrient_2002a@449.92:457.48 FOR A CHAIR YOU HAVE TO LEARN A LOT ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE BODY AND WHAT THE BODY NEEDS WANTS
NielsDiffrient_2002a@466.24:475.12 I ENDED UP DESIGNING THE CHAIR I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU I SHOULD SAY ONE MORE THING WHEN I WAS DOING THOSE MODEL AIRPLANES
NielsDiffrient_2002a@475.96:482.80 I DID EVERYTHING I CONCEIVED THE KIND OF AIRPLANE I BASICALLY ENGINEERED IT
NielsDiffrient_2002a@483.61:490.03 I BUILT IT AND I FLEW IT AND THAT'S THE WAY I WORK NOW
NielsDiffrient_2002a@494.89:506.03 WHEN I STARTED THIS CHAIR IT WAS NOT A PRECONCEIVED NOTION DESIGN NOWADAYS IF YOU MEAN IT YOU DON'T START WITH STYLING SKETCHES
NielsDiffrient_2002a@506.79:519.16 I STARTED WITH A LOT OF LOOSE IDEAS ROUGHLY EIGHT OR NINE YEARS AGO AND THE LOOSE IDEAS HAD SOMETHING TO WITH WHAT I KNEW HAPPENED WITH PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@520.91:529.02 PEOPLE WHO WORKED AND USED TASK SEATING A GREAT MANY OF THEM SITTING IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER ALL DAY LONG
NielsDiffrient_2002a@529.82:538.64 AND I FELT THE ONE THING THEY DON'T NEED IS A CHAIR THAT INTERFERES WITH THEIR MAIN REASON FOR SITTING THERE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@539.34:546.01 SO I TOOK THE APPROACH THAT THE CHAIR SHOULD DO AS MUCH FOR THEM AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@546.41:554.22 OR AS MECHANISTICALLY POSSIBLE SO THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO FUSS WITH IT SO MY IDEA WAS THAT
NielsDiffrient_2002a@568.16:578.26 NOW THAT MAY NOT MEAN A LOT TO SOME OF YOU BUT YOU KNOW MOST GOOD CHAIRS DO RECLINE BECAUSE IT'S BENEFICIAL TO OPEN UP THIS JOINT BETWEEN YOUR LEGS
NielsDiffrient_2002a@578.61:587.36 AND YOUR UPPER BODY FOR BETTER BREATHING AND BETTER FLOW SO THAT IF YOU SIT DOWN ON MY CHAIR
NielsDiffrient_2002a@589.94:593.13 TALL OR SIX FOOT SIX IT ALWAYS
NielsDiffrient_2002a@593.96:606.63 DEALS WITH YOUR WEIGHT AND TRANSFERS THE AMOUNT OF FORCE REQUIRED TO RECLINE IN A WAY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING TO ADJUST
NielsDiffrient_2002a@608.07:618.39 I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT UP FRONT THIS IS A TRADE OFF THERE ARE DRAWBACKS TO THIS ONE IS YOU CAN'T ACCOMMODATE EVERYBODY
NielsDiffrient_2002a@629.86:639.58 BUT THE COMPROMISE I FELT WAS IN MY FAVOR BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T ADJUST THEIR CHAIRS THEY WILL SIT IN THEM FOREVER I HAD SOMEBODY
NielsDiffrient_2002a@640.26:650.94 BUS OUT TO THE RACETRACK TELL ME ABOUT HIS SISTER CALLING HIM HE SAID SHE HAD ONE OF THE NEW BETTER CHAIRS SHE SAID OH I LOVE IT SHE SAID BUT IT'S TOO HIGH SO HE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@655.16:664.38 COME OVER AND LOOK AT IT HE CAME OVER AND LOOKED AT IT HE REACHED DOWN HE PULLED A LEVER AND THE CHAIR SANK DOWN SHE SAID OH IT'S WONDERFUL HOW DID YOU DO THAT
NielsDiffrient_2002a@665.66:675.92 SHOWED HER THE LEVER WELL THAT'S TYPICAL OF A LOT OF US WORKING IN CHAIRS AND WHY SHOULD YOU GET A TWENTY PAGE MANUAL ABOUT HOW TO RUN A CHAIR
NielsDiffrient_2002a@678.18:685.78 I HAD ONE FOR A WRISTWATCH ONCE TWENTY PAGES ANYWAY I FELT THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
NielsDiffrient_2002a@686.20:694.82 MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT IN ORDER TO GET THIS KIND OF ACTION THE OTHER THING I FELT WAS THAT ARMRESTS HAD NEVER REALLY BEEN
NielsDiffrient_2002a@696.60:704.08 PROPERLY APPROACHED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF HOW MUCH OF HOW MUCH OF AN AIDE THEY COULD BE TO YOUR WORK LIFE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@704.74:712.00 BUT I FELT IT WAS TOO MUCH TO ASK TO HAVE TO ADJUST EACH INDIVIDUAL ARM REST IN ORDER TO GET IT WHERE YOU WANTED
NielsDiffrient_2002a@712.57:723.87 SO I SPENT A LONG TIME I SAID I WORKED ON EIGHT OR NINE YEARS ON IT AND EACH OF THESE THINGS WENT ALONG SORT OF IN PARALLEL BUT INCREMENTALLY WERE A PROBLEM OF THEIR OWN
NielsDiffrient_2002a@724.53:733.22 I WORKED A LONG TIME ON FIGURING OUT HOW TO MOVE THE ARMS OVER A MUCH GREATER ARC THAT IS UP AND DOWN
NielsDiffrient_2002a@734.11:741.91 AND MAKE THEM A LOT EASIER SO THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO USE A BUTTON AND SO AFTER MANY TRIALS MANY FAILURES
NielsDiffrient_2002a@742.15:752.26 WE CAME UP WITH A VERY SIMPLE ARRANGEMENT IN WHICH WE COULD JUST MOVE ONE ARM OR THE OTHER AND THEY GO UP EASILY AND STOP WHERE YOU WANT
NielsDiffrient_2002a@753.99:767.87 YOU CAN PUT THEM DOWN ESSENTIALLY OUT OF THE WAY NO ARMS AT ALL OR YOU CAN PULL THEM UP WHERE YOU WANT THEM AND THIS WAS ANOTHER THING THAT I FELT WHILE NOT NEARLY AS ROMANTIC AS CARY GRANT
NielsDiffrient_2002a@768.66:778.59 NEVERTHELESS BEGINS TO GRAB A LITTLE BIT OF AESTHETIC OPERATION AESTHETIC PERFORMANCE INTO A PRODUCT
NielsDiffrient_2002a@779.26:792.13 THE NEXT AREA THAT WAS OF INTEREST TO ME WAS THE FACT THAT RECLINING WAS A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR AND THE MORE YOU CAN RECLINE IN A WAY THE BETTER IT IS
NielsDiffrient_2002a@792.27:801.64 THE MORE THE ANGLE BETWEEN HERE AND HERE OPENS UP AND NOWADAYS WITH A SCREEN IN FRONT OF YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE YOUR EYE DROP TOO FAR IN THE RECLINE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@801.88:809.67 SO WE KEEP IT AT MORE OR LESS THE SAME LEVEL BUT YOU TRANSFER WEIGHT OFF YOUR TAILBONES
NielsDiffrient_2002a@833.54:846.01 ALL THE WEIGHT OF YOUR UPPER TORSO YOUR ARMS YOUR HEAD GOES RIGHT DOWN THROUGH YOUR BACK YOUR SPINE INTO THOSE BONES WHEN YOU SIT AND THAT'S A LOT OF LOAD
NielsDiffrient_2002a@846.48:856.01 JUST RELIEVING YOUR ARMS WITH ARMRESTS TAKES TWENTY PERCENT OF THAT LOAD OFF NOW THAT IF YOUR SPINE IS NOT HELD IN A GOOD POSITION
NielsDiffrient_2002a@856.32:864.12 WILL HELP BEND YOUR SPINE THE WRONG WAY AND SO ON SO TO UNLOAD THAT
NielsDiffrient_2002a@864.62:867.20 GREAT WEIGHT
NielsDiffrient_2002a@868.48:878.28 INDEED EXISTS YOU CAN RECLINE WHEN YOU RECLINE YOU TAKE AWAY A LOT OF THAT LOAD OFF YOUR BOTTOM END AND TRANSFER IT TO YOUR BACK
NielsDiffrient_2002a@879.06:888.72 THE SAME TIME AS I SAY YOU OPEN UP THIS JOINT AND BREATHABILITY IS GOOD BUT TO DO THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY
NielsDiffrient_2002a@889.94:898.71 AMOUNT OF RECLINE IT GETS TO THE POINT WHERE YOU NEED A HEADREST BECAUSE NEARLY ALWAYS
NielsDiffrient_2002a@910.58:923.94 YOU HAVE TO USE MUSCLE FORCE TO HOLD YOUR HEAD THERE SO THAT'S WHERE A HEADREST COMES IN NOW HEADREST IS A CHALLENGE BECAUSE YOU WANT IT TO ADJUST ENOUGH SO THAT IT WILL FIT
NielsDiffrient_2002a@925.21:929.71 YOU KNOW A TALL GUY AND A SHORT GIRL SO HERE WE ARE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@930.70:933.57 GOT FIVE INCHES OF ADJUSTMENT HERE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@934.60:944.77 IN ORDER TO GET THE HEADREST IN THE RIGHT PLACE BUT THEN I KNEW FROM EXPERIENCE AND LOOKING AROUND IN OFFICES WHERE THERE WERE CHAIRS WITH HEADRESTS
NielsDiffrient_2002a@945.96:955.23 NOBODY WOULD EVER BOTHER TO REACH BACK AND TURN A KNOB AND ADJUST THE HEADREST TO PUT IT IN POSITION AND YOU NEED IT IN A DIFFERENT POSITION WHEN YOU'RE UPRIGHT
NielsDiffrient_2002a@955.47:963.42 THEN WHEN YOU'RE RECLINED SO I KNEW THAT HAD TO BE SOLVED AND HAD TO BE AUTOMATIC SO IF YOU WATCH THIS CHAIR AS I RECLINE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@963.83:971.34 THE HEADREST COMES UP TO MEET MY NECK IDEALLY YOU WANT TO PUT THE HEAD SUPPORT IN
NielsDiffrient_2002a@971.79:976.48 CRANIAL AREA RIGHT THERE SO THAT
NielsDiffrient_2002a@978.57:981.93 PART OF IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO WORK OUT
NielsDiffrient_2002a@991.99:1000.79 AND PUT GEL IN THE CUSHIONS AND IN THE ARMRESTS TO ABSORB POINT LOAD DISTRIBUTES THE LOADING
NielsDiffrient_2002a@1001.10:1013.38 SO YOU DON'T GET HARD SPOTS YOU CANT HIT YOUR ELBOW ON BOTTOM AND I DID WANT TO DEMONSTRATE THE FACT THAT THE CHAIR CAN ACCOMMODATE PEOPLE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@1014.17:1018.38 WHILE YOU'RE SITTING IN IT YOU CAN ADJUST IT DOWN FOR THE FIVE FOOTER
NielsDiffrient_2002a@1019.40:1021.06 OR YOU CAN ADJUST IT
NielsDiffrient_2002a@1022.18:1026.46 FOR THE SIX FOOT SIX GUY
NielsDiffrient_2002a@1027.73:1029.72 ALL WITHIN THE SCOPE
NielsDiffrient_2002a@1030.24:1031.97 OF A FEW SIMPLE ADJUSTMENTS
