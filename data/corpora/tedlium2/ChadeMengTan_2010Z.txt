ChadeMengTan_2010Z@16.1:24.59 WHAT DOES THE HAPPIEST MAN IN THE WORLD LOOK LIKE HE CERTAINLY DOESN 'T LOOK LIKE ME HE LOOKS LIKE THIS
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@25.03:31.66 HIS NAME IS MATTHIEU RICARD SO HOW DO YOU GET TO BE THE HAPPIEST MAN IN THE WORLD
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@31.87:36.53 WELL IT TURNS OUT THERE IS A WAY TO MEASURE HAPPINESS IN THE BRAIN
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@36.53:54.95 AND YOU DO THAT BY MEASURING THE RELATIVE ACTIVATION OF THE LEFT PREFRONTAL CORTEX IN THE FMRI VERSUS THE RIGHT PREFRONTAL CORTEX AND MATTHIEU 'S HAPPINESS MEASURE IS OFF THE CHARTS HE 'S BY FAR THE HAPPIEST MAN EVER MEASURED BY SCIENCE
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@62.27:64.47 PERHAPS SOMETHING VERY NAUGHTY
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@88.93:94.65 AND TO DO THAT BY CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR INNER PEACE
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@118.82:136.24 BECAUSE IF COMPASSION WAS A CHORE NOBODY 'S GOING TO DO IT EXCEPT MAYBE THE DALAI LAMA OR SOMETHING BUT IF COMPASSION WAS FUN EVERYBODY 'S GOING TO DO IT THEREFORE TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR GLOBAL COMPASSION
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@136.42:144.05 ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TO REFRAME COMPASSION AS SOMETHING THAT IS FUN
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@144.58:156.56 BUT FUN IS NOT ENOUGH WHAT IF COMPASSION IS ALSO PROFITABLE WHAT IF COMPASSION IS ALSO GOOD FOR BUSINESS
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@156.82:162.86 THEN EVERY BOSS EVERY MANAGER IN THE WORLD WILL WANT TO HAVE COMPASSION LIKE THIS
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@163.57:174.1 THAT WOULD CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR WORLD PEACE SO I STARTED PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT COMPASSION LOOKS LIKE IN A BUSINESS SETTING
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@174.6:177.08 FORTUNATELY I DIDN 'T HAVE TO LOOK VERY FAR
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@177.41:193.5 BECAUSE WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY EYES IN GOOGLE MY COMPANY I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER COMPASSIONATE COMPANIES IN THE WORLD BUT GOOGLE IS THE PLACE I 'M FAMILIAR WITH BECAUSE I 'VE BEEN THERE FOR TEN YEARS SO I 'LL USE GOOGLE AS THE CASE STUDY
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@193.59:197.25 GOOGLE IS A COMPANY BORN OF IDEALISM
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@197.4:208.04 IT 'S A COMPANY THAT THRIVES ON IDEALISM AND MAYBE BECAUSE OF THAT COMPASSION IS ORGANIC AND WIDESPREAD COMPANY WIDE
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@225.82:232.49 AND THEN OTHER GOOGLERS JOIN IN AND IT JUST GETS BIGGER AND BIGGER AND SOMETIMES IT GETS BIG ENOUGH TO BECOME OFFICIAL
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@233.05:237.74 SO IN OTHER WORDS IT ALMOST ALWAYS STARTS FROM THE BOTTOM UP
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@238.73:240.56 AND LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@240.64:249.61 THE FIRST EXAMPLE IS THE LARGEST ANNUAL COMMUNITY EVENT WHERE GOOGLERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD DONATE THEIR LABOR TO THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@249.8:253.33 WAS INITIATED AND ORGANIZED BY THREE EMPLOYEES
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@253.75:260.36 BEFORE IT BECAME OFFICIAL BECAUSE IT JUST BECAME TOO BIG ANOTHER EXAMPLE THREE GOOGLERS A CHEF
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@261.08:273.45 AN ENGINEER AND MOST FUNNY A MASSAGE THERAPIST THREE OF THEM THEY LEARNED ABOUT A REGION IN INDIA WHERE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVE WITHOUT A SINGLE MEDICAL FACILITY
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@273.52:284.08 SO WHAT DO THEY DO THEY JUST GO AHEAD AND START A FUNDRAISER AND THEY RAISE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUILD THIS HOSPITAL THE FIRST HOSPITAL OF ITS KIND FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@284.25:286.53 DURING THE HAITI EARTHQUAKE
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@316.18:323.26 WORKING ON ISSUES SUCH AS EDUCATION POVERTY HEALTH CARE AND THE ENVIRONMENT
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@323.64:338.23 THERE IS SO MUCH ORGANIC SOCIAL ACTION ALL AROUND GOOGLE THAT THE COMPANY DECIDED TO FORM A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY TEAM JUST TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS AND THIS IDEA AGAIN CAME FROM THE GRASSROOTS FROM TWO GOOGLERS
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@338.56:342.88 WHO WROTE THEIR OWN JOB DESCRIPTIONS AND VOLUNTEERED THEMSELVES FOR THE JOB
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@343.61:356.58 AND I FOUND IT FASCINATING THAT THE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY TEAM WAS NOT FORMED AS PART OF SOME GRAND CORPORATE STRATEGY IT WAS TWO PERSONS SAYING LET 'S DO THIS AND THE COMPANY SAID YES
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@357.09:369.33 SO IT TURNS OUT THAT GOOGLE IS A COMPASSIONATE COMPANY BECAUSE GOOGLERS FOUND COMPASSION TO BE FUN BUT AGAIN FUN IS NOT ENOUGH
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@396.63:405.88 AND THERE IS A MOTIVATIONAL COMPONENT WHICH IS I WANT TO HELP YOU SO WHAT HAS THIS GOT TO DO WITH BUSINESS LEADERSHIP
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@406.56:420.49 ACCORDING TO A VERY COMPREHENSIVE STUDY LED BY JIM COLLINS AND DOCUMENTED IN THE BOOK GOOD TO GREAT IT TAKES A VERY SPECIAL KIND OF LEADER TO BRING A COMPANY FROM GOODNESS TO GREATNESS
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@421.24:429.35 AND HE CALLS THEM LEVEL FIVE LEADERS THESE ARE LEADERS WHO IN ADDITION TO BEING HIGHLY CAPABLE
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@447.65:451.99 AND THEY ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCH MAKE THE BEST BUSINESS LEADERS
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@452.6:457.1 AND IF YOU LOOK AT THESE QUALITIES IN THE CONTEXT OF COMPASSION
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@457.65:463.23 WE FIND THAT THE COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE COMPONENTS OF COMPASSION
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@463.5:467.61 UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE AND EMPATHIZING WITH PEOPLE
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@467.64:473 INHIBITS TONES DOWN WHAT I CALL THE EXCESSIVE SELF OBSESSION
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@479.03:484.6 THE MOTIVATIONAL COMPONENT OF COMPASSION CREATES AMBITION FOR GREATER GOOD
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@485.68:502.39 IN OTHER WORDS COMPASSION IS THE WAY TO GROW LEVEL FIVE LEADERS AND THIS IS THE FIRST COMPELLING BUSINESS BENEFIT THE SECOND COMPELLING BENEFIT OF COMPASSION IS THAT IT CREATES AN INSPIRING WORKFORCE
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@502.39:506.89 EMPLOYEES MUTUALLY INSPIRE EACH OTHER TOWARDS GREATER GOOD
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@507:519.77 IT CREATES A VIBRANT ENERGETIC COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE ADMIRE AND RESPECT EACH OTHER I MEAN YOU COME TO WORK IN THE MORNING AND YOU WORK WITH THREE GUYS WHO JUST UP AND DECIDE TO BUILD A HOSPITAL IN INDIA
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@537.3:549.21 SO HAVING SAID ALL THAT WHAT IS THE SECRET FORMULA FOR BREWING COMPASSION IN THE CORPORATE SETTING IN OUR EXPERIENCE THERE ARE THREE INGREDIENTS
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@549.68:557.51 THE FIRST INGREDIENT IS TO CREATE A CULTURE OF PASSIONATE CONCERN FOR THE GREATER GOOD
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@558.55:560.1 SO ALWAYS THINK
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@560.34:569.37 HOW IS YOUR COMPANY AND YOUR JOB SERVING THE GREATER GOOD OR HOW CAN YOU FURTHER SERVE THE GREATER GOOD
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@569.77:586.99 THIS AWARENESS OF SERVING THE GREATER GOOD IS VERY SELF INSPIRING AND IT CREATES FERTILE GROUND FOR COMPASSION TO GROW IN THAT 'S ONE THE SECOND INGREDIENT IS AUTONOMY SO IN GOOGLE THERE 'S A LOT OF AUTONOMY
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@599.07:603.43 IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A CULTURE OF COMPASSION
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@603.48:605.21 AND IDEALISM
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@605.56:618.65 AND YOU LET YOUR PEOPLE ROAM FREE THEY WILL DO THE RIGHT THING IN THE MOST COMPASSIONATE WAY THE THIRD INGREDIENT IS TO FOCUS ON INNER DEVELOPMENT AND PERSONAL GROWTH
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@619.53:622.47 LEADERSHIP TRAINING IN GOOGLE FOR EXAMPLE
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@628.98:630.98 EMPATHY AND COMPASSION
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@671.53:675.05 THE FIRST STEP IS ATTENTION TRAINING
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@675.94:685.11 ATTENTION IS THE BASIS OF ALL HIGHER COGNITIVE AND EMOTIONAL ABILITIES THEREFORE
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@685.15:688.85 ANY CURRICULUM FOR TRAINING EMOTION INTELLIGENCE
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@689.03:702.03 HAS TO BEGIN WITH ATTENTION TRAINING THE IDEA HERE IS TO TRAIN ATTENTION TO CREATE A QUALITY OF MIND THAT IS CALM AND CLEAR AT THE SAME TIME
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@702.03:718.58 AND THIS CREATES THE FOUNDATION FOR EMOTION INTELLIGENCE THE SECOND STEP FOLLOWS THE FIRST STEP THE SECOND STEP IS DEVELOPING SELF KNOWLEDGE AND SELF MASTERY SO USING THE SUPERCHARGED ATTENTION FROM STEP ONE
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@719.16:725.84 WE CREATE A HIGH RESOLUTION PERCEPTION INTO THE COGNITIVE AND EMOTIVE PROCESSES
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@731.57:733.84 AND THE PROCESS OF EMOTION
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@734.09:751.08 WITH HIGH CLARITY OBJECTIVITY AND FROM A THIRD PERSON PERSPECTIVE AND ONCE YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CREATE THE KIND OF SELF KNOWLEDGE THAT ENABLES SELF MASTERY THE THIRD STEP FOLLOWING THE SECOND STEP
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@751.26:766.31 IS TO CREATE NEW MENTAL HABITS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IMAGINE THIS IMAGINE WHENEVER YOU MEET ANY OTHER PERSON ANY TIME YOU MEET A PERSON YOUR HABITUAL INSTINCTIVE FIRST THOUGHT IS I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@786.81:797.12 AND THIS ALSO CREATES THE CONDITIONS FOR COMPASSION IN THE WORKPLACE SOMEDAY WE HOPE TO OPEN SOURCE SEARCH INSIDE YOURSELF
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@797.97:804.71 SO THAT EVERYBODY IN THE CORPORATE WORLD WILL AT LEAST BE ABLE TO USE IT AS A REFERENCE
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@804.89:808.56 AND IN CLOSING I WANT TO END THE SAME PLACE I STARTED
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@808.61:810.48 WITH HAPPINESS
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@810.99:815.62 I WANT TO QUOTE THIS GUY THE GUY IN ROBES NOT THE OTHER GUY THE DALAI LAMA
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@815.84:819.09 WHO SAID IF YOU WANT OTHERS TO BE HAPPY
ChadeMengTan_2010Z@819.35:824.37 PRACTICE COMPASSION IF YOU WANT TO BE HAPPY PRACTICE COMPASSION
