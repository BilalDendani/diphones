BjarkeIngels_2009G ABOUT ARCHITECTURE QUITE OFTEN JUST STAYS ON CONTEMPLATING THE FINAL RESULT SORT OF THE ARCHITECTURAL OBJECT IS THE LATEST TOWER IN LONDON A GHERKIN OR A SAUSAGE OR A
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO RECENTLY WE ASKED OURSELVES IF WE COULD INVENT A FORMAT THAT COULD ACTUALLY TELL THE STORIES BEHIND THE PROJECTS MAYBE COMBINING IMAGES AND DRAWINGS AND WORDS TO ACTUALLY SORT OF
BjarkeIngels_2009G TELL STORIES ABOUT ARCHITECTURE AND WE DISCOVERED THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO INVENT IT IT ALREADY EXISTED IN THE FORM OF A COMIC BOOK
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO WE BASICALLY COPIED THE FORMAT OF THE COMIC BOOK SO ACTUALLY WE TELL THE STORIES OF BEHIND THE SCENES HOW OUR PROJECTS ACTUALLY EVOLVE THROUGH ADAPTATION AND IMPROVISATION
BjarkeIngels_2009G THE TURMOIL AND THE OPPORTUNITIES AND THE INCIDENTS OF THE REAL WORLD WE CALL THIS COMIC BOOK YES IS MORE
BjarkeIngels_2009G WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A SORT OF EVOLUTION OF THE IDEAS OF SOME OF OUR HEROES IN THIS CASE IT'S MIES VAN DER ROHE 'S LESS IS MORE HE TRIGGERED THE MODERNIST REVOLUTION
BjarkeIngels_2009G AFTER HIM FOLLOWED THE POST MODERN COUNTER REVOLUTION ROBERT VENTURI SAYING LESS IS A BORE AFTER HIM PHILIP JOHNSON SORT OF INTRODUCED
BjarkeIngels_2009G AND WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SAY WITH YES IS MORE IS BASICALLY TRYING TO QUESTION THIS IDEA THAT THE ARCHITECTURAL AVANT GARDE IS ALMOST ALWAYS NEGATIVELY DEFINED AS WHO OR WHAT WE ARE AGAINST
BjarkeIngels_2009G THE CLICHE OF THE RADICAL ARCHITECT IS THE SORT OF ANGRY YOUNG MAN REBELLING AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT OR THIS IDEA OF THE MISUNDERSTOOD GENIUS FRUSTRATED THAT THE WORLD DOESN'T FIT IN WITH HIS OR HER IDEAS
BjarkeIngels_2009G RATHER THAN REVOLUTION WE'RE MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN EVOLUTION THIS IDEA THAT THINGS GRADUALLY EVOLVE BY ADAPTING AND IMPROVISING TO THE
BjarkeIngels_2009G HIS FAMOUS EVOLUTIONARY TREE COULD ALMOST BE A DIAGRAM OF THE WAY WE WORK AS YOU CAN SEE A PROJECT EVOLVES THROUGH A SERIES OF GENERATIONS OF DESIGN MEETINGS
BjarkeIngels_2009G AT EACH MEETING THERE'S WAY TOO MANY IDEAS ONLY THE BEST ONES CAN SURVIVE AND THROUGH A PROCESS OF ARCHITECTURAL SELECTION WE MIGHT CHOOSE A REALLY BEAUTIFUL MODEL
BjarkeIngels_2009G OR WE MIGHT HAVE A VERY FUNCTIONAL MODEL WE MATE THEM THEY HAVE SORT OF MUTANT OFFSPRING
BjarkeIngels_2009G AND THROUGH THESE SORT OF GENERATIONS OF DESIGN MEETINGS WE ARRIVE AT A DESIGN A VERY LITERAL WAY OF SHOWING IT IS A PROJECT WE DID FOR A LIBRARY AND A HOTEL IN COPENHAGEN
BjarkeIngels_2009G THE DESIGN PROCESS WAS LIKE REALLY TOUGH ALMOST LIKE A STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL BUT GRADUALLY AN IDEA EVOLVED THIS SORT OF IDEA OF A RATIONAL TOWER THAT MELTS TOGETHER WITH THE SURROUNDING CITY
BjarkeIngels_2009G BUT DARWIN DOESN'T ONLY EXPLAIN THE EVOLUTION OF A SINGLE IDEA AS YOU CAN SEE SOMETIMES A SUBSPECIES BRANCHES OFF AND QUITE OFTEN WE SIT IN A DESIGN MEETING AND WE DISCOVER THAT
BjarkeIngels_2009G THIS GREAT IDEA IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK IN THIS CONTEXT BUT FOR ANOTHER CLIENT IN ANOTHER CULTURE IT COULD REALLY BE THE RIGHT ANSWER TO A DIFFERENT QUESTION
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO AS A RESULT WE NEVER THROW ANYTHING OUT WE KEEP OUR OFFICE ALMOST LIKE AN ARCHIVE OF ARCHITECTURAL BIODIVERSITY YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU MIGHT NEED IT
BjarkeIngels_2009G AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO NOW IN AN ACT OF WARP SPEED STORY TELLING IS TELL THE STORY OF HOW TWO PROJECTS EVOLVED BY ADAPTING AND IMPROVISING TO THE HAPPENSTANCE OF THE WORLD
BjarkeIngels_2009G THE FIRST STORY STARTS LAST YEAR WHEN WE WENT TO SHANGHAI TO DO THE COMPETITION FOR THE DANISH NATIONAL PAVILION FOR THE WORLD EXPO IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND WE SAW THIS GUY
BjarkeIngels_2009G THE MASCOT OF THE EXPO AND HE LOOKS STRANGELY FAMILIAR IN FACT HE LOOKED LIKE A BUILDING WE HAD DESIGNED FOR
BjarkeIngels_2009G A HOTEL IN THE NORTH OF SWEDEN WHEN WE SUBMITTED IT FOR THE SWEDISH COMPETITION WE THOUGHT IT WAS A REALLY COOL SCHEME BUT IT DIDN'T EXACTLY LOOK LIKE SOMETHING FROM THE NORTH OF SWEDEN THE SWEDISH JURY DIDN'T THINK SO
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO WE LOST BUT THEN WE HAD A MEETING WITH A CHINESE BUSINESSMAN WHO SAW OUR DESIGN AND SAID WOW THAT'S THE CHINESE CHARACTER FOR THE WORD PEOPLE
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO APPARENTLY THIS IS HOW YOU WRITE PEOPLE AS IN THE PEOPLE 'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA WE EVEN DOUBLE CHECKED AND AT THE SAME TIME WE GOT INVITED TO EXHIBIT AT THE SHANGHAI CREATIVE INDUSTRY WEEK
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO THE PEOPLE 'S BUILDING AS WE CALLED IT THIS IS OUR TWO INTERPRETERS SORT OF READING THE ARCHITECTURE IT WENT ON THE COVER OF THE WEN WEI PO NEWSPAPER WHICH GOT MISTER LIANG YU CHEN THE MAYOR OF SHANGHAI TO VISIT THE EXHIBITION AND WE HAD THE CHANCE TO EXPLAIN THE PROJECT
BjarkeIngels_2009G AND HE SAID SHANGHAI IS THE CITY IN THE WORLD WITH MOST SKYSCRAPERS BUT TO HIM IT WAS AS IF THE CONNECTION TO THE ROOTS HAD BEEN CUT OVER
BjarkeIngels_2009G BUT LIKE I SAID HAIBAO LOOKED VERY FAMILIAR BECAUSE HE IS ACTUALLY THE CHINESE CHARACTER FOR PEOPLE AND THEY CHOSE THIS MASCOT BECAUSE THE THEME
BjarkeIngels_2009G OF THE EXPO IS BETTER CITY BETTER LIFE SUSTAINABILITY AND WE THOUGHT LIKE SUSTAINABILITY HAS GROWN INTO BEING THIS SORT OF NEO PROTESTANT IDEA THAT IS HAS TO HURT IN ORDER TO DO GOOD
BjarkeIngels_2009G YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TAKE LONG WARM SHOWERS YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO FLY ON HOLIDAYS BECAUSE IT'S BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
BjarkeIngels_2009G YOU GET THIS IDEA THAT SUSTAINABLE LIFE IS LESS FUN THAN NORMAL LIFE SO WE THOUGHT THAT MAYBE IT COULD BE INTERESTING TO FOCUS ON EXAMPLES WHERE A SUSTAINABLE CITY ACTUALLY INCREASES THE QUALITY OF LIFE
BjarkeIngels_2009G CHINA HAS MANY GREAT POETS BUT WE DISCOVERED THAT IN THE PEOPLE 'S REPUBLIC PUBLIC SCHOOL CURRICULUM THEY HAVE THREE FAIRY TALES BY AN TU SHUNG OR HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSON AS WE CALL HIM
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO THAT MEANS THAT ALL ONE POINT THREE BILLION CHINESE HAVE GROWN UP WITH THE EMPEROR 'S NEW CLOTHES THE MATCHSTICK GIRL AND THE LITTLE MERMAID IT'S ALMOST LIKE A FRAGMENT OF DANISH CULTURE INTEGRATED INTO CHINESE CULTURE
BjarkeIngels_2009G AND IT SORT OF SHOWS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO CITIES COPENHAGEN SHANGHAI MODERN EUROPEAN BUT THEN WE LOOKED AT RECENT URBAN DEVELOPMENT
BjarkeIngels_2009G AND WE NOTICED THAT THIS IS LIKE A SHANGHAI STREET THIRTY YEARS AGO ALL BIKES NO CARS THIS IS HOW IT LOOKS TODAY ALL TRAFFIC JAM BICYCLES HAVE BECOME FORBIDDEN MANY PLACES
BjarkeIngels_2009G WE DONATE ONE THOUSAND BIKES TO SHANGHAI SO IF YOU COME TO THE EXPO GO STRAIGHT TO THE DANISH PAVILLION GET A DANISH BIKE AND THEN CONTINUE ON THAT TO VISIT THE OTHER PAVILLIONS
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO WE THOUGHT THAT THESE EXPOS QUITE OFTEN HAVE A LOT OF STATE FINANCED PROPAGANDA IMAGES STATEMENTS BUT NO REAL EXPERIENCE SO JUST LIKE WITH A BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT YOU CAN TRY IT LIKE WITH THE
BjarkeIngels_2009G THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE NORMALLY OBJECT THAT IT DOESN'T SOUND VERY SUSTAINABLE TO SAIL WATER FROM COPENHAGEN TO CHINA BUT IN FACT THE CONTAINER SHIPS GO FULL OF GOOD FROM CHINA TO DENMARK
BjarkeIngels_2009G AND THEN THEY SAIL EMPTY BACK SO QUITE OFTEN YOU LOAD WATER FOR BALLAST SO WE CAN ACTUALLY HITCH A RIDE FOR FREE AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS SORT OF HARBOR BATH WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO PUT THE ACTUAL LITTLE MERMAID
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO THE REAL MERMAID THE REAL WATER AND THE REAL BIKES AND WHEN SHE'S GONE WE'RE GOING TO INVITE A CHINESE ARTIST TO REINTERPRET HER THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE PAVILION IS THIS SORT OF LOOP OF EXHIBITION AND
BjarkeIngels_2009G WHEN YOU GO TO THE EXHIBITION YOU'LL SEE THE MERMAID AND THE POOL YOU'LL WALK AROUND START LOOKING FOR A BICYCLE ON THE ROOF JUMP ON YOUR RIDE AND THEN CONTINUE OUT INTO THE REST OF THE EXPO
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO WHEN WE ACTUALLY WON THE COMPETITION WE HAD TO DO AN EXHIBITION IN CHINA EXPLAINING THE PROJECT AND TO OUR SURPRISE WE GOT ONE OF OUR BOARDS BACK WITH CORRECTIONS FROM THE CHINESE STATE CENSORSHIP
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO WHEN IT CAME OUT IN DENMARK THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO MOVE OUR NATIONAL MONUMENT THE NATIONAL PEOPLE 'S PARTY SORT OF
BjarkeIngels_2009G REBELLED AGAINST IT THEY TRIED TO PASS A LAW AGAINST MOVING THE MERMAID SO FOR THE FIRST TIME I GOT INVITED TO SPEAK AT THE NATIONAL PARLIAMENT
BjarkeIngels_2009G IN THE MORNING FROM NINE TO ELEVEN THEY WERE DISCUSSING THE BAILOUT PACKAGE HOW MANY BILLIONS TO INVEST IN SAVING THE DANISH ECONOMY
BjarkeIngels_2009G BUT TO CONCLUDE IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE MERMAID FROM MAY TO DECEMBER NEXT YEAR DON'T COME TO COPENHAGEN BECAUSE SHE'S GOING TO BE IN SHANGHAI
BjarkeIngels_2009G IF YOU DO COME TO COPENHAGEN YOU WILL PROBABLY SEE AN INSTALLATION BY AI WEIWEI THE CHINESE ARTIST BUT IF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT INTERVENES IT MIGHT EVEN BE A PANDA
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO THE SECOND STORY THAT I'D LIKE TO TELL IS ACTUALLY STARTS IN MY OWN HOUSE THIS IS MY APARTMENT
BjarkeIngels_2009G THIS IS THE VIEW FROM MY APARTMENT OVER THE SORT OF LANDSCAPE OF TRIANGULAR BALCONIES THAT OUR CLIENT CALLED THE LEONARDO DICAPRIO BALCONY
BjarkeIngels_2009G AND
BjarkeIngels_2009G THEY FORM THIS SORT OF VERTICAL BACKYARD WHERE ON A NICE SUMMER DAY YOU'LL ACTUALLY GET INTRODUCED TO ALL YOUR NEIGHBORS IN A VERTICAL RADIUS OF TEN METERS
BjarkeIngels_2009G THE HOUSE IS SORT OF A DISTORTION OF A SQUARE BLOCK TRYING TO ZIG ZAG IT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE APARTMENTS LOOK AT THE STRAIGHT VIEWS INSTEAD OF INTO EACH OTHER
BjarkeIngels_2009G BECAUSE COPENHAGEN IS COMPLETELY FLAT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A NICE SOUTH FACING SLOPE WITH A VIEW YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO DO IT YOURSELF THEN WE SORT OF CUT UP THE VOLUME SO WE WOULDN'T BLOCK THE VIEW FROM MY APARTMENT
BjarkeIngels_2009G AND ESSENTIALLY THE PARKING IS SORT OF OCCUPYING THE DEEP SPACE UNDERNEATH THE APARTMENTS AND UP IN THE SUN YOU HAVE LIKE A SINGLE LAYER OF APARTMENTS
BjarkeIngels_2009G ALL THE SPLENDORS OF A SUBURBAN LIFESTYLE LIKE A HOUSE WITH A GARDEN WITH A SORT OF METROPOLITAN VIEW AND A SORT OF DENSE URBAN LOCATION
BjarkeIngels_2009G THIS IS OUR FIRST ARCHITECTURAL MODEL THIS IS AN AERIAL PHOTO TAKEN LAST SUMMER AND ESSENTIALLY THE APARTMENTS COVER THE PARKING THEY ARE ACCESSED THROUGH THIS DIAGONAL
BjarkeIngels_2009G AND
BjarkeIngels_2009G THE FACADE OF THE PARKING WE WANTED TO MAKE THE PARKING NATURALLY VENTILATED SO WE NEEDED TO PERFORATE IT AND WE DISCOVERED THAT BY CONTROLLING THE SIZE OF THE HOLES WE COULD ACTUALLY TURN THE ENTIRE FACADE INTO A GIGANTIC NATURALLY VENTILATED RASTERIZED IMAGE
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO IF YOU GO BACK INTO THE PARKING INTO THE CORRIDORS IT'S ALMOST LIKE TRAVELING INTO A PARALLEL UNIVERSE FROM
BjarkeIngels_2009G INTO THIS SORT OF SOUTH FACING URBAN OASIS THE WOOD OF YOUR APARTMENT CONTINUES OUTSIDE BECOMING THE FACADES IF YOU GO EVEN FURTHER IT TURNS INTO
BjarkeIngels_2009G AND ALL THE RAINWATER THAT DROPS ON THE MOUNTAIN IS ACTUALLY ACCUMULATED AND THERE IS AN AUTOMATIC IRRIGATION SYSTEM
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO THE MOUNTAIN IS LIKE OUR FIRST BUILT EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE LIKE TO REFER TO AS ARCHITECTURAL ALCHEMY THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY CREATE IF NOT GOLD THEN AT LEAST ADDED VALUE BY MIXING TRADITIONAL INGREDIENTS LIKE NORMAL APARTMENTS AND NORMAL PARKING
BjarkeIngels_2009G AND IN THIS CASE ACTUALLY OFFER PEOPLE THE CHANCE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A LIFE WITH A GARDEN OR A LIFE IN THE CITY THEY CAN ACTUALLY HAVE BOTH
BjarkeIngels_2009G AS AN ARCHITECT IT'S REALLY HARD TO SET THE AGENDA YOU CAN'T JUST SAY THAT
BjarkeIngels_2009G NOW I'D LIKE TO DO A SUSTAINABLE CITY IN CENTRAL ASIA BECAUSE THAT'S NOT REALLY HOW YOU GET COMMISSIONS YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO SORT OF ADAPT AND IMPROVISE TO THE OPPORTUNITIES AND ACCIDENTS THAT HAPPEN AND THE SORT OF TURMOIL OF THE WORLD
BjarkeIngels_2009G ONE LAST EXAMPLE IS THAT RECENTLY WE LIKE LAST SUMMER WE WON THE COMPETITION TO DESIGN A NORDIC NATIONAL BANK THIS WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE BANK WHEN HE WAS STILL SMILING
BjarkeIngels_2009G IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAPITAL SO WE WERE REALLY EXCITED BY THIS OPPORTUNITY UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS THE NATIONAL BANK OF ICELAND
BjarkeIngels_2009G AT THE SAME TIME WE ACTUALLY HAD A VISITOR A MINISTER FROM AZERBAIJAN CAME TO OUR OFFICE WE TOOK HIM TO SEE THE MOUNTAIN
BjarkeIngels_2009G AND HE GOT VERY EXCITED BY THIS IDEA THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY MAKE MOUNTAINS OUT OF ARCHITECTURE BECAUSE AZERBAIJAN IS KNOWN AS THE ALPS OF CENTRAL ASIA
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO HE ASKED US IF WE COULD ACTUALLY IMAGINE AN URBAN MASTER PLAN ON AN ISLAND OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL THAT WOULD RECREATE THE SILHOUETTE OF THE SEVEN MOST SIGNIFICANT MOUNTAINS OF AZERBAIJAN
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO WE TOOK THE COMMISSION AND WE MADE THIS SMALL MOVIE THAT I'D LIKE TO SHOW WE QUITE OFTEN MAKE LITTLE MOVIES WE ALWAYS ARGUE A LOT ABOUT THE SOUNDTRACK BUT IN THIS CASE IT WAS REALLY EASY TO CHOOSE THE SONG
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO BASICALLY BAKU IS THIS SORT OF CRESCENT BAY OVERLOOKING THE ISLAND OF ZIRA THE ISLAND THAT WE ARE PLANNING ALMOST LIKE THE DIAGRAM OF THEIR FLAG
BjarkeIngels_2009G OUR MAIN IDEA WAS TO SORT OF SAMPLE THE SEVEN MOST SIGNIFICANT MOUNTAINS OF THE TOPOGRAPHY OF AZERBAIJAN AND REINTERPRET THEM INTO URBAN AND ARCHITECTURAL STRUCTURES INHABITABLE OF HUMAN LIFE
BjarkeIngels_2009G IT HAS NO VEGETATION IT HAS NO WATER IT HAS NO ENERGY NO RESOURCES SO WE ACTUALLY SORT OF DESIGNED THE ENTIRE ISLAND AS A SINGLE ECOSYSTEM EXPLOITING WIND ENERGY TO DRIVE THE DESALINATION PLANTS AND TO USE THE THERMAL PROPERTIES OF WATER
BjarkeIngels_2009G TO HEAT AND COOL THE BUILDINGS AND ALL THE SORT OF EXCESS FRESHWATER WASTEWATER IS FILTERED ORGANICALLY INTO THE LANDSCAPE GRADUALLY TRANSFORMING THE DESERT ISLAND INTO SORT OF A GREEN LUSH LANDSCAPE
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO YOU CAN SAY WHERE AN URBAN DEVELOPMENT NORMALLY HAPPENS AT THE EXPENSE OF NATURE IN THIS CASE IT'S ACTUALLY CREATING NATURE
BjarkeIngels_2009G AND THE BUILDINGS THEY DON'T ONLY SORT OF INVOKE THE IMAGERY OF THE MOUNTAINS THEY ALSO OPERATE LIKE MOUNTAINS THEY CREATE SHELTER FROM THE WIND
BjarkeIngels_2009G THEY ACCUMULATE THE SOLAR ENERGY THEY ACCUMULATE THE WATER SO THEY ACTUALLY TRANSFORM THE ENTIRE ISLAND INTO A SINGLE ECOSYSTEM
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO WE RECENTLY PRESENTED THE MASTER PLAN AND IT HAS GOTTEN APPROVED AND THIS SUMMER WE ARE STARTING THE CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS
BjarkeIngels_2009G OF THE TWO FIRST MOUNTAINS IN WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE FIRST CARBON NEUTRAL ISLAND IN
BjarkeIngels_2009G SO IN A WAY YOU CAN SEE HOW THE MOUNTAIN IN COPENHAGEN SORT OF EVOLVED INTO THE SEVEN PEAKS OF AZERBAIJAN
BjarkeIngels_2009G WITH A LITTLE LUCK AND SOME MORE EVOLUTION MAYBE IN TEN YEARS IT COULD BE THE FIVE MOUNTAINS OF ON MARS THANK YOU
