NicMarks_2010G@19.73:20.40 DID NOT SAY
NicMarks_2010G@23.13:24.63 WHEN HE INSPIRED THE CIVIL RIGHTS
NicMarks_2010G@26.20:27.65 HE SAID I HAVE A DREAM
NicMarks_2010G@36.76:38.41 AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE
NicMarks_2010G@38.84:44.17 BECAUSE IF YOU THINK OF EVERY MAJOR BLOCKBUSTING FILM OF RECENT TIMES
NicMarks_2010G@45.28:48.45 NEARLY ALL OF ITS VISIONS FOR HUMANITY ARE APOCALYPTIC
NicMarks_2010G@49.31:53.69 I THINK THIS FILM IS ONE OF THE HARDEST WATCHES OF MODERN TIMES THE ROAD
NicMarks_2010G@54.33:58.49 IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF FILMMAKING BUT EVERYTHING IS DESOLATE
NicMarks_2010G@61.29:62.81 AND JUST A FATHER AND SON
NicMarks_2010G@63.33:64.05 TRYING TO SURVIVE
NicMarks_2010G@66.79:69.90 AND I THINK THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT OF WHICH I AM A
NicMarks_2010G@76.36:79.40 WE HAVE PEDDLED A NIGHTMARISH VISION OF WHAT'S GOING TO
NicMarks_2010G@80.39:82.91 WE HAVE FOCUSED ON THE WORST CASE SCENARIO
NicMarks_2010G@83.31:88.48 WE HAVE FOCUSED ON THE PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE NOT THOUGHT ENOUGH ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS
NicMarks_2010G@89.97:93.34 USED FEAR IF YOU LIKE TO GRAB PEOPLE 'S ATTENTION
NicMarks_2010G@94.56:96.32 AND ANY PSYCHOLOGIST WILL TELL YOU
NicMarks_2010G@98.22:103.86 IN THE ORGANISM IS LINKED TO FLIGHT MECHANISM IT'S PART OF THE FIGHT AND FLIGHT MECHANISM
NicMarks_2010G@108.57:111.02 A DEER A DEER FREEZES VERY VERY STILL
NicMarks_2010G@111.83:113.03 POISED TO RUN AWAY
NicMarks_2010G@116.00:124.14 ASKING PEOPLE TO ENGAGE WITH OUR AGENDA AROUND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE PEOPLE ARE FREEZING AND RUNNING AWAY
NicMarks_2010G@124.74:126.05 BECAUSE WE'RE USING FEAR
NicMarks_2010G@126.96:129.32 AND I THINK THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT HAS TO GROW UP
NicMarks_2010G@129.92:135.73 AND START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT PROGRESS IS WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE TO BE IMPROVING THE HUMAN LOT
NicMarks_2010G@136.72:142.76 AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE I THINK IS THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE CORNERED THE MARKET IN TERMS OF PROGRESS
NicMarks_2010G@143.73:152.59 IS A FINANCIAL DEFINITION OF WHAT PROGRESS IS AN ECONOMIC DEFINITION OF WHAT PROGRESS IS THAT SOMEHOW IF WE GET THE RIGHT NUMBERS TO GO UP
NicMarks_2010G@160.42:163.69 ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT SOMEHOW LIFE IS GOING TO GET BETTER
NicMarks_2010G@165.04:171.87 THIS IS SOMEHOW APPEALING TO HUMAN GREED INSTEAD OF FEAR THAT MORE IS BETTER COME ON
NicMarks_2010G@172.26:173.76 IN THE WESTERN WORLD WE HAVE ENOUGH
NicMarks_2010G@177.38:188.55 AND WE'VE KNOW FOR A LONG TIME THAT THIS IS NOT A GOOD MEASURE OF THE WELFARE OF NATIONS IN FACT THE ARCHITECT OF OUR NATIONAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM SIMON KUZNETS IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES SAID THAT
NicMarks_2010G@188.89:192.79 A NATION 'S WELFARE CAN SCARCELY BE INFERRED FROM THEIR NATIONAL INCOME
NicMarks_2010G@193.38:202.24 BUT WE'VE CREATED A NATIONAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM WHICH IS FIRMLY BASED ON PRODUCTION AND PRODUCING STUFF AND INDEED THIS IS PROBABLY HISTORICAL AND IT HAD ITS TIME
NicMarks_2010G@202.47:211.26 IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR WE NEEDED TO PRODUCE A LOT OF STUFF AND INDEED WE WERE SO SUCCESSFUL AT PRODUCING CERTAIN TYPES OF STUFF THAT WE DESTROYED A LOT OF EUROPE AND WE HAD TO REBUILD IT AFTERWARDS
NicMarks_2010G@219.99:228.68 THIS VISIONARY MAN ROBERT KENNEDY AT THE START OF HIS ILL FATED PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN GAVE THE MOST ELOQUENT DECONSTRUCTION
NicMarks_2010G@229.15:241.93 OF GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT THAT EVER HAS BEEN AND HE FINISHED HIS TALK WITH THE PHRASE THAT THE GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT MEASURES EVERYTHING EXCEPT THAT WHICH MAKES LIFE WORTHWHILE
NicMarks_2010G@242.51:250.51 HOW CRAZY IS THAT THAT OUR MEASURE OF PROGRESS OUR DOMINANT MEASURE OF PROGRESS IN SOCIETY IS MEASURING EVERYTHING EXCEPT THAT
NicMarks_2010G@251.06:252.84 WHICH MAKES LIFE WORTHWHILE
NicMarks_2010G@253.46:255.29 I BELIEVE IF KENNEDY WAS ALIVE TODAY
NicMarks_2010G@256.57:261.09 BE ASKING STATISTICIANS SUCH AS MYSELF TO GO OUT AND FIND OUT
NicMarks_2010G@261.61:269.02 WHAT MAKES LIFE WORTHWHILE HE'D BE ASKING US TO REDESIGN OUR NATIONAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM TO BE BASED UPON
NicMarks_2010G@269.73:275.71 SUCH IMPORTANT THINGS AS SOCIAL JUSTICE SUSTAINABILITY AND PEOPLE 'S WELL BEING
NicMarks_2010G@276.06:280.04 AND ACTUALLY SOCIAL SCIENTISTS HAVE ALREADY GONE OUT AND ASKED THESE QUESTIONS AROUND THE WORLD
NicMarks_2010G@286.11:288.57 AND UNSURPRISINGLY PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD
NicMarks_2010G@289.08:298.76 THAT WHAT THEY WANT IS HAPPINESS FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR FAMILIES THEIR CHILDREN THEIR COMMUNITIES OKAY THEY THINK MONEY IS SLIGHTLY IMPORTANT IT'S THERE
NicMarks_2010G@304.70:308.83 WE ALL NEED TO LOVE AND BE LOVED IN LIFE IT'S NOT NEARLY AS IMPORTANT AS HEALTH
NicMarks_2010G@309.48:315.94 WE WANT TO BE HEALTHY AND LIVE A FULL LIFE THESE SEEM TO BE NATURAL HUMAN ASPIRATIONS
NicMarks_2010G@316.61:324.23 WHY ARE STATISTICIANS NOT MEASURING THESE WHY ARE WE NOT THINKING OF THE PROGRESS OF NATIONS IN THESE TERMS INSTEAD OF JUST HOW MUCH STUFF WE HAVE
NicMarks_2010G@333.98:346.15 WE CREATED AT THE ORGANIZATION THAT I WORK FOR THE NEW ECONOMICS FOUNDATION SOMETHING WE CALL THE HAPPY PLANET INDEX BECAUSE WE THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE HAPPY AND THE PLANET SHOULD BE HAPPY WHY DON'T WE CREATE A MEASURE OF PROGRESS THAT SHOWS THAT
NicMarks_2010G@346.76:360.61 AND WHAT WE DO IS WE SAY THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF A NATION IS HOW SUCCESSFUL IS IT AT CREATING HAPPY AND HEALTHY LIVES FOR ITS CITIZENS THAT SHOULD BE THE GOAL OF EVERY NATION ON THE PLANET BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER
NicMarks_2010G@361.60:363.40 THAT THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL INPUT TO THAT
NicMarks_2010G@364.41:367.16 AND THAT IS HOW MANY OF THE PLANET 'S RESOURCES WE USE
NicMarks_2010G@368.20:379.07 WE ALL HAVE ONE PLANET WE ALL HAVE TO SHARE IT IT IS THE ULTIMATE SCARCE RESOURCE THE ONE PLANET THAT WE SHARE AND ECONOMICS IS VERY INTERESTED IN SCARCITY
NicMarks_2010G@379.61:390.99 WHEN IT HAS A SCARCE RESOURCE THAT IT WANTS TO TURN INTO A DESIRABLE OUTCOME IT THINKS IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY IT THINKS IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH BANG DO WE GET FOR OUR BUCK
NicMarks_2010G@391.64:400.48 AND THIS IS A MEASURE OF HOW MUCH WELL BEING WE GET FOR OUR PLANETARY RESOURCE USE IT IS AN EFFICIENCY MEASURE AND PROBABLY THE EASIEST WAY TO SHOW YOU
NicMarks_2010G@401.81:403.09 IS TO SHOW YOU THIS GRAPH
NicMarks_2010G@404.09:405.72 RUNNING HORIZONTALLY ALONG THE
NicMarks_2010G@415.04:424.08 RUNNING VERTICALLY UPWARDS IS A MEASURE CALLED HAPPY LIFE YEARS IT'S ABOUT THE WELL BEING OF NATIONS IT'S LIKE A HAPPINESS ADJUSTED LIFE EXPECTANCY
NicMarks_2010G@424.49:436.50 IT'S LIKE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF LIFE IN NATIONS AND THE YELLOW DOT THERE YOU SEE IS THE GLOBAL AVERAGE NOW THERE'S A HUGE ARRAY OF NATIONS AROUND THAT GLOBAL AVERAGE TO THE TOP RIGHT OF THE GRAPH
NicMarks_2010G@458.89:467.24 IN HOBBESIAN TERMS LIFE IS SHORT AND BRUTISH THERE THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY IN MANY OF THESE COUNTRIES IS ONLY FORTY YEARS
NicMarks_2010G@468.91:473.48 MALARIA HIV AIDS ARE KILLING A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THESE REGIONS OF THE WORLD
NicMarks_2010G@474.32:482.57 BUT NOW FOR THE GOOD NEWS THERE ARE SOME COUNTRIES UP THERE YELLOW TRIANGLES THAT ARE DOING BETTER THAN GLOBAL AVERAGE THAT ARE HEADING UP TOWARDS THE TOP LEFT OF THE GRAPH
NicMarks_2010G@482.90:491.32 THIS IS AN ASPIRATIONAL GRAPH WE WANT TO BE TOP LEFT WHERE GOOD LIVES DON'T COST THE EARTH THEY'RE LATIN AMERICAN THE COUNTRY ON ITS OWN UP AT THE TOP
NicMarks_2010G@491.80:493.85 A PLACE I HAVEN'T BEEN TO MAYBE SOME OF YOU HAVE
NicMarks_2010G@508.55:513.59 THEY ARE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST GALLUP WORLD POLL THE HAPPIEST NATION ON THE PLANET
NicMarks_2010G@515.38:516.98 ANYBODY MORE THAN SWITZERLAND AND
NicMarks_2010G@553.66:558.83 PROGRAMS HEALTH AND EDUCATION THEY HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST LITERACY RATES IN LATIN AMERICA AND IN THE WORLD
NicMarks_2010G@561.21:564.69 LATIN VIBE DON'T THEY THEY HAVE THE SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS
NicMarks_2010G@578.33:583.66 AND THE CHALLENGE REALLY IS TO PULL THE GLOBAL AVERAGE UP HERE
NicMarks_2010G@584.54:592.54 THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT WE NEED TO PULL COUNTRIES FROM THE BOTTOM AND WE NEED TO PULL COUNTRIES FROM THE RIGHT OF THE GRAPH
NicMarks_2010G@593.18:594.91 AND THEN WE'RE STARTING TO CREATE
NicMarks_2010G@606.26:613.06 AND THIS IS THE TREND IN WELL BEING OVER THAT TIME A SMALL INCREASE BUT THIS IS THE TREND IN ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT
NicMarks_2010G@636.49:645.63 ACTUALLY NOT VERY LONG AWAY IT'S HALF A HUMAN LIFETIME AWAY A CHILD ENTERING SCHOOL TODAY WILL BE MY AGE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTY THIS IS NOT THE VERY DISTANT FUTURE
NicMarks_2010G@646.91:652.35 THIS IS WHAT THE U K GOVERNMENT TARGET ON CARBON AND GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS LOOKS LIKE
NicMarks_2010G@653.34:654.33 AND I PUT IT TO YOU THAT
NicMarks_2010G@654.90:656.27 NOT BUSINESS AS USUAL
NicMarks_2010G@657.30:660.11 THAT IS CHANGING OUR BUSINESS THAT IS CHANGING THE WAY WE
NicMarks_2010G@661.66:664.15 WE DO OUR GOVERNMENT POLICY AND WE LIVE OUR LIVES
NicMarks_2010G@666.17:676.68 WE NEED TO CARRY ON INCREASING WELL BEING NO ONE CAN GO TO THE POLLS AND SAY THAT QUALITY OF LIFE IS GOING TO REDUCE NONE OF US I THINK WANT HUMAN PROGRESS TO
NicMarks_2010G@677.36:687.57 I THINK WE WANT IT TO CARRY ON I THINK WE WANT THE LOT OF HUMANITY TO KEEP ON INCREASING AND I THINK THIS IS WHERE CLIMATE CHANGE SKEPTICS AND DENIERS COME IN I THINK THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT THEY WANT QUALITY OF LIFE TO KEEP INCREASING
NicMarks_2010G@687.76:693.19 THEY WANT TO HOLD ON TO WHAT THEY'VE GOT AND IF WE'RE GOING TO ENGAGE THEM I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO
NicMarks_2010G@694.41:703.82 AND THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO REALLY INCREASE EFFICIENCY EVEN MORE NOW THAT'S ALL VERY EASY TO DRAW GRAPHS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT THE POINT IS WE NEED TO TURN THOSE CURVES
NicMarks_2010G@704.25:716.14 AND THIS IS WHERE I THINK WE CAN TAKE A LEAF OUT OF SYSTEMS THEORY SYSTEMS ENGINEERS WHERE THEY CREATE FEEDBACK LOOPS PUT THE RIGHT INFORMATION AT THE RIGHT POINT OF TIME HUMAN BEINGS ARE VERY MOTIVATED BY THE NOW
NicMarks_2010G@716.70:727.46 YOU PUT A SMART METER IN YOUR HOME AND YOU SEE HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY YOU'RE USING RIGHT NOW HOW MUCH IT'S COSTING YOU YOUR KIDS GO AROUND AND TURN THE LIGHTS OFF PRETTY QUICKLY WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE FOR SOCIETY
NicMarks_2010G@737.08:743.33 AND WHY DO I HEAR THAT WHY DON'T I HEAR HOW MUCH ENERGY BRITAIN USED YESTERDAY OR AMERICAN USED YESTERDAY
NicMarks_2010G@743.95:755.25 DID WE MEET OUR THREE PERCENT ANNUAL TARGET ON REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS THAT'S HOW YOU CREATE A COLLECTIVE GOAL YOU PUT IT OUT THERE INTO THE MEDIA AND START THINKING ABOUT IT AND WE NEED POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOPS
NicMarks_2010G@755.63:757.03 FOR INCREASING WELL BEING
NicMarks_2010G@757.67:767.01 AT A GOVERNMENT LEVEL THEY MIGHT CREATE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS OF WELL BEING AT A BUSINESS LEVEL YOU MIGHT LOOK AT THE WELL BEING OF YOUR EMPLOYEES WHICH WE KNOW IS REALLY LINKED TO CREATIVITY WHICH IS LINKED TO INNOVATION
NicMarks_2010G@767.61:773.70 A LOT OF INNOVATION TO DEAL WITH THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AT A PERSONAL LEVEL WE NEED THESE NUDGES TOO
NicMarks_2010G@777.61:785.07 IN THE U K WE HAVE A STRONG PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGE ON FIVE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES A DAY AND HOW MUCH EXERCISE WE SHOULD DO NEVER MY BEST THING
NicMarks_2010G@786.60:787.97 WHAT ARE THESE FOR HAPPINESS
NicMarks_2010G@789.10:791.57 WHAT ARE THE FIVE THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD DO EVERY DAY TO BE
NicMarks_2010G@803.43:810.43 PIECE OF WORK WE DID WAS ON WHAT FIVE POSITIVE ACTIONS CAN YOU DO TO IMPROVE WELL BEING IN YOUR LIFE AND THE POINT OF THESE IS THEY ARE
NicMarks_2010G@810.80:818.48 NOT QUITE THE SECRETS OF HAPPINESS BUT THEY ARE THINGS THAT I THINK HAPPINESS WILL FLOW OUT THE SIDE FROM AND THE FIRST OF THESE IS TO CONNECT
NicMarks_2010G@818.96:829.09 IS THAT YOUR SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT CORNERSTONES OF YOUR LIFE DO YOU INVEST THE TIME WITH YOUR LOVED ONES THAT YOU COULD DO AND ENERGY KEEP BUILDING THEM
NicMarks_2010G@829.71:836.23 THE SECOND ONE IS BE ACTIVE THE FASTEST WAY OUT OF A BAD MOOD STEP OUTSIDE GO FOR A WALK TURN THE RADIO ON AND
NicMarks_2010G@843.91:852.24 HOW AWARE ARE YOU OF THINGS GOING ON AROUND THE WORLD THE SEASONS CHANGING PEOPLE AROUND YOU DO YOU NOTICE WHAT'S BUBBLING UP FOR YOU AND TRYING TO EMERGE
NicMarks_2010G@852.92:858.69 BASED ON A LOT OF EVIDENCE FOR MINDFULNESS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY STRONG FOR OUR WELL BEING
NicMarks_2010G@859.48:861.59 THE FOURTH IS KEEP LEARNING
NicMarks_2010G@862.34:868.46 AND KEEP IS IMPORTANT LEARNING THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE LIFE COURSE OLDER PEOPLE WHO KEEP LEARNING AND ARE CURIOUS
NicMarks_2010G@868.77:878.27 THEY HAVE MUCH BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES THAN THOSE WHO START TO CLOSE DOWN BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE FORMAL LEARNING IT'S NOT KNOWLEDGE BASED IT'S MORE CURIOSITY IT CAN BE LEARNING TO COOK A NEW DISH
NicMarks_2010G@881.25:888.15 KEEP LEARNING AND THE FINAL ONE IS THAT MOST ANTI ECONOMIC OF ACTIVITIES BUT GIVE
NicMarks_2010G@889.16:898.10 OUR GENEROSITY OUR ALTRUISM OUR COMPASSION ARE ALL HARDWIRED TO THE REWARD MECHANISM IN OUR BRAIN WE FEEL GOOD IF WE GIVE
NicMarks_2010G@898.72:907.40 YOU CAN DO AN EXPERIMENT WHERE YOU GIVE TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE A HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE MORNING YOU TELL ONE OF THEM TO SPEND IT ON THEMSELVES AND ONE ON OTHER PEOPLE
NicMarks_2010G@908.03:920.05 YOU MEASURE THEIR HAPPINESS AT THE END OF THE DAY THOSE THAT HAVE GONE AND SPENT ON OTHER PEOPLE ARE MUCH HAPPIER THAT THOSE THAT SPENT IT ON THEMSELVES AND THESE FIVE WAYS WHICH WE PUT ONTO THESE HANDY POSTCARDS
NicMarks_2010G@921.03:932.48 I WOULD SAY DON'T HAVE TO COST THE EARTH THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CARBON CONTENT THEY DON'T NEED A LOT OF MATERIAL GOODS TO BE SATISFIED AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY QUITE FEASIBLE THAT HAPPINESS DOES NOT COST THE EARTH
NicMarks_2010G@936.48:939.11 ON THE EVE OF HIS DEATH GAVE AN INCREDIBLE SPEECH
NicMarks_2010G@940.12:943.38 HE SAID I KNOW THERE ARE CHALLENGES AHEAD THERE MAY BE TROUBLE AHEAD
NicMarks_2010G@944.28:951.66 BUT I FEAR NO ONE I DON'T CARE I HAVE BEEN TO THE MOUNTAIN TOP AND I HAVE SEEN THE PROMISED LAND
NicMarks_2010G@952.27:960.40 HE WAS A PREACHER BUT I BELIEVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT AND IN FACT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO GO TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN TOP
NicMarks_2010G@961.18:971.59 AND IT NEEDS TO LOOK OUT AND IT NEEDS TO SEE THE PROMISED LAND OR THE LAND OF PROMISE AND IT NEEDS TO HAVE A VISION OF A WORLD THAT WE ALL WANT
NicMarks_2010G@972.22:980.75 AND NOT ONLY THAT WE NEED TO CREATE A GREAT TRANSITION TO GET THERE AND WE NEED TO PAVE THAT GREAT TRANSITION WITH GOOD THINGS HUMAN BEINGS
NicMarks_2010G@981.28:992.00 WANT TO BE HAPPY PAVE THEM WITH THE FIVE WAYS AND WE NEED TO HAVE SIGNPOSTS GATHERING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND POINTING THEM SOMETHING LIKE THE HAPPY PLANET INDEX AND THEN I BELIEVE
NicMarks_2010G@992.42:994.21 THAT WE CAN ALL CREATE A WORLD WE ALL WANT
