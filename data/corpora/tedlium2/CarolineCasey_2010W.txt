CarolineCasey_2010W I WANTED TO BE A BIKER CHICK LAUGHTER I WANTED TO RACE CARS
CarolineCasey_2010W AND I WANTED TO BE MOWGLI FROM THE JUNGLE BOOK
CarolineCasey_2010W BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL ABOUT BEING FREE
CarolineCasey_2010W NOT THAT WE COULD HAVE AFFORDED I DRIVE BUT TO GIVE ME THE DREAM OF DRIVING
CarolineCasey_2010W AND ON MY SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY I ACCOMPANIED MY LITTLE SISTER IN COMPLETE INNOCENCE
CarolineCasey_2010W AS I ALWAYS HAD ALL MY LIFE
CarolineCasey_2010W MY VISUALLY IMPAIRED SISTER TO GO TO SEE AN EYE SPECIALIST BECAUSE BIG SISTERS ARE ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO SUPPORT THEIR LITTLE SISTERS
CarolineCasey_2010W AND MY LITTLE SISTER WANTED TO BE A PILOT GOD HELP HER
CarolineCasey_2010W SO I USED TO GET MY EYES TESTED JUST FOR FUN
CarolineCasey_2010W AND ON MY SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY AFTER MY FAKE EYE EXAM
CarolineCasey_2010W THE EYE SPECIALIST JUST NOTICED IT HAPPENED TO BE MY BIRTHDAY AND HE SAID
CarolineCasey_2010W ON MY SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY
CarolineCasey_2010W AS JANIS IAN WOULD BEST SAY
CarolineCasey_2010W I LEARNED THE TRUTH AT SEVENTEEN
CarolineCasey_2010W EVERY MAN IN THIS ROOM EVEN YOU STEVE IS GEORGE CLOONEY
CarolineCasey_2010W NO SPECIAL NEEDS SCHOOLS
CarolineCasey_2010W AND THEY DECIDED TO TELL ME
CarolineCasey_2010W A BOY GIVEN A GIRL 'S NAME
CarolineCasey_2010W I WOULD GROW UP AND LEARN FROM EXPERIENCE HOW TO BE TOUGH AND HOW TO SURVIVE
CarolineCasey_2010W BUT MORE SIGNIFICANTLY THEY GAVE ME THE ABILITY TO BELIEVE
CarolineCasey_2010W TOTALLY TO BELIEVE
CarolineCasey_2010W AND I SWEAR TO GOD I WALKED OUT OF HIS OFFICE I WILL DRIVE
CarolineCasey_2010W I WILL DRIVE YOU 'RE MAD I 'LL DRIVE I KNOW I CAN DRIVE
CarolineCasey_2010W AND WITH THE SAME DOGGED DETERMINATION THAT MY FATHER HAD BRED INTO ME SINCE I WAS SUCH A CHILD HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO SAIL KNOWING I COULD NEVER SEE WHERE I WAS GOING I COULD NEVER SEE THE SHORE AND I COULDN 'T SEE THE SAILS AND I COULDN 'T SEE THE DESTINATION BUT HE TOLD ME TO BELIEVE AND FEEL THE WIND IN MY FACE
CarolineCasey_2010W AND THAT WIND IN MY FACE MADE ME BELIEVE THAT HE WAS MAD AND I WOULD DRIVE AND FOR THE NEXT ELEVEN YEARS I SWORE NOBODY WOULD EVER FIND OUT THAT I COULDN 'T SEE BECAUSE I DIDN 'T WANT TO BE A FAILURE AND I DIDN 'T WANT TO BE WEAK AND I BELIEVED I COULD DO IT SO I RAMMED THROUGH LIFE AS ONLY A CASEY CAN DO
CarolineCasey_2010W AND I WAS AN ARCHEOLOGIST AND THEN I BROKE THINGS AND THEN I MANAGED A RESTAURANT AND THEN I SLIPPED ON THINGS AND THEN I WAS A MASSEUSE AND THEN I WAS A LANDSCAPE GARDENER AND THEN I WENT TO BUSINESS SCHOOL AND YOU KNOW DISABLED PEOPLE ARE HUGELY EDUCATED
CarolineCasey_2010W AND THEN I WENT IN AND I GOT A GLOBAL CONSULTING JOB WITH ACCENTURE AND THEY DIDN 'T EVEN KNOW
CarolineCasey_2010W AND IT 'S EXTRAORDINARY HOW FAR BELIEF CAN TAKE YOU
CarolineCasey_2010W IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE TWO AND A HALF YEARS INTO THAT JOB
CarolineCasey_2010W VERY UNEXPECTEDLY
CarolineCasey_2010W AND TWO YEARS IN I REALLY COULD SEE VERY LITTLE
CarolineCasey_2010W AND I FOUND MYSELF IN FRONT OF AN HR MANAGER
CarolineCasey_2010W AND YOU ALL KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU DON 'T NEED TO HAVE A DISABILITY TO KNOW THAT WE ALL KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO ADMIT WEAKNESS AND FAILURE AND IT 'S FRIGHTENING ISN 'T
CarolineCasey_2010W IT 'S SUCH A SMALL THING
CarolineCasey_2010W AND YOU KNOW HOW EXHAUSTING IT CAN BE TO TRY TO
CarolineCasey_2010W AND THAT EYE SPECIALIST HE DIDN 'T BOTHER TESTING MY EYES GOD NO IT WAS THERAPY AND HE ASKED ME SEVERAL QUESTIONS OF WHICH MANY WERE
CarolineCasey_2010W WHY WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING SO HARD
CarolineCasey_2010W NOT TO BE YOURSELF
CarolineCasey_2010W AND DO YOU LOVE WHAT YOU DO
CarolineCasey_2010W AND AS I LEFT HIS OFFICE

CarolineCasey_2010W BECAUSE MY ORGANIZATION WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE NAMED AFTER MY ELEPHANT BECAUSE DISABILITY IS LIKE THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM AND I WANTED TO MAKE YOU SEE IT IN A POSITIVE WAY NO CHARITY NO PITY BUT I WANTED TO WORK ONLY AND TRULY WITH BUSINESS AND MEDIA LEADERSHIP TO TOTALLY REFRAME DISABILITY IN A WAY THAT WAS
CarolineCasey_2010W AND POSSIBLE
