AmyWebb_2013S MY NAME IS AMY WEBB AND A FEW YEARS AGO I FOUND MYSELF AT THE END OF YET ANOTHER
AmyWebb_2013S FANTASTIC RELATIONSHIP THAT CAME BURNING DOWN IN A SPECTACULAR FASHION AND I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT 'S WRONG WITH ME I DON 'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS KEEPS HAPPENING SO I ASKED EVERYBODY IN MY LIFE WHAT THEY THOUGHT I TURNED TO MY GRANDMOTHER WHO ALWAYS HAD PLENTY OF ADVICE AND SHE SAID
AmyWebb_2013S NOW AS IT TURNS OUT I 'M SOMEBODY WHO THINKS A LOT ABOUT DATA AS YOU 'LL SOON FIND I AM CONSTANTLY SWIMMING IN NUMBERS AND FORMULAS AND CHARTS
AmyWebb_2013S I FIGURE I 'M PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO DATE SOMEBODY FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS BEFORE I 'M READY TO GET MONOGAMOUS AND BEFORE WE CAN SORT OF COHABITATE AND WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN FOR A WHILE BEFORE WE CAN GET ENGAGED AND IF I WANT TO START HAVING CHILDREN BY THE TIME I 'M THIRTY FIVE
AmyWebb_2013S THAT MEANT THAT I WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY TO MARRIAGE FIVE YEARS AGO
AmyWebb_2013S AND IT 'S A BIG CITY AND I FIGURED IN THIS ENTIRE PLACE THERE ARE LOTS OF POSSIBILITIES SO AGAIN I STARTED DOING SOME MATH POPULATION OF PHILADELPHIA IT HAS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE I FIGURE ABOUT HALF OF THAT ARE MEN SO THAT TAKES THE NUMBER DOWN TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND I 'M LOOKING FOR A GUY BETWEEN THE AGES OF THIRTY AND THIRTY SIX
AmyWebb_2013S WHICH WAS ONLY FOUR PERCENT OF THE POPULATION SO NOW I 'M DEALING WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF THIRTY THOUSAND MEN I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY WHO WAS JEWISH BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT I AM AND THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT 'S ONLY TWO POINT THREE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION
AmyWebb_2013S I FIGURE I 'M ATTRACTED TO MAYBE ONE OUT OF TEN OF THOSE MEN AND THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS GOING TO DEAL WITH SOMEBODY WHO WAS AN AVID GOLFER
AmyWebb_2013S PERSON CITY OF PHILADELPHIA
AmyWebb_2013S I COULD TRY ONLINE DATING
AmyWebb_2013S NOW I LIKE THE IDEA OF ONLINE DATING BECAUSE IT 'S PREDICATED ON AN ALGORITHM AND THAT 'S REALLY JUST A SIMPLE WAY OF SAYING I 'VE GOT A PROBLEM I 'M GOING TO USE SOME DATA RUN IT THROUGH A SYSTEM AND GET TO A SOLUTION
AmyWebb_2013S SO ONLINE DATING IS THE SECOND MOST POPULAR WAY THAT PEOPLE NOW MEET EACH OTHER BUT AS IT TURNS OUT ALGORITHMS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS
AmyWebb_2013S AND THE MATCHMAKER WOULD SORT OF THINK THROUGH ALL OF THIS PUT TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER AND THAT WOULD BE THE END OF IT
AmyWebb_2013S SO IN MY CASE I THOUGHT
AmyWebb_2013S WELL WILL DATA AND AN ALGORITHM LEAD ME TO MY PRINCE CHARMING
AmyWebb_2013S SO I DECIDED TO SIGN ON NOW THERE WAS ONE SMALL CATCH AS I 'M SIGNING ON TO THE VARIOUS DATING WEBSITES AS IT HAPPENS I WAS REALLY REALLY BUSY BUT THAT ACTUALLY
AmyWebb_2013S SO I JUST COPIED AND PASTED FROM MY RESUME
AmyWebb_2013S SO IN THE DESCRIPTIVE PART UP TOP I SAID THAT I WAS AN AWARD WINNING JOURNALIST AND A FUTURE THINKER WHEN I WAS ASKED ABOUT FUN ACTIVITIES AND MY IDEAL DATE I SAID MONETIZATION
AmyWebb_2013S THIS WAS NOT THE BEST WAY TO PUT MY MOST SEXY FOOT FORWARD
AmyWebb_2013S BUT THE REAL FAILURE WAS THAT THERE WERE PLENTY OF MEN FOR ME TO DATE THESE ALGORITHMS HAD A SEA FULL OF MEN THAT WANTED TO TAKE ME OUT ON LOTS OF DATES WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE TRULY AWFUL DATES
AmyWebb_2013S THERE WAS THIS GUY STEVE THE I T GUY
AmyWebb_2013S AND EIGHTY S MUSIC
AmyWebb_2013S AND SO I AGREED TO GO OUT WITH HIM SO STEVE THE I T GUY INVITED ME OUT TO ONE OF PHILADELPHIA 'S WHITE TABLE CLOTH EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE RESTAURANTS AND WE WENT IN AND RIGHT OFF THE BAT OUR CONVERSATION REALLY WASN 'T TAKING FLIGHT
AmyWebb_2013S BUT HE WAS ORDERING A LOT OF FOOD IN FACT HE DIDN 'T EVEN BOTHER LOOKING AT THE MENU
AmyWebb_2013S HE WAS ORDERING MULTIPLE APPETIZERS MULTIPLE ENTREES FOR ME AS WELL AND SUDDENLY THERE ARE PILES AND PILES OF FOOD ON OUR TABLE ALSO LOTS AND LOTS OF BOTTLES OF WINE SO WE 'RE NEARING THE END OF OUR CONVERSATION AND THE END OF DINNER AND I 'VE DECIDED STEVE THE I T GUY AND I ARE REALLY JUST NOT MEANT FOR EACH OTHER BUT WE 'LL PART WAYS AS FRIENDS
AmyWebb_2013S WHEN HE GETS UP TO GO TO THE BATHROOM
AmyWebb_2013S AND IN THE MEANTIME THE BILL COMES TO OUR TABLE
AmyWebb_2013S THAT WAS MY ENTIRE MONTH 'S RENT
AmyWebb_2013S SO NEEDLESS TO SAY
AmyWebb_2013S I WAS NOT HAVING A GOOD NIGHT SO I RUN HOME I CALL MY MOTHER I CALL MY SISTER AND AS I DO AT THE END OF EACH ONE OF THESE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE DATES I REGALE THEM WITH THE DETAILS
AmyWebb_2013S AND THEY SAY TO ME
AmyWebb_2013S THE NUMBER OF TIMES A MAN FORCED ME TO HIGH FIVE
AmyWebb_2013S AND AS IT HAPPENS THE ALGORITHMS THAT WERE SETTING US UP
AmyWebb_2013S THEY WEREN 'T BAD EITHER THESE ALGORITHMS WERE DOING EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE DESIGNED TO DO WHICH WAS TO TAKE OUR USER GENERATED INFORMATION IN MY CASE MY RESUME AND
AmyWebb_2013S MATCH IT UP WITH OTHER PEOPLE 'S INFORMATION
AmyWebb_2013S THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT THESE WEBSITES ARE ASKING US QUESTIONS LIKE ARE YOU A DOG PERSON OR A CAT PERSON DO YOU LIKE HORROR FILMS OR ROMANCE FILMS I 'M NOT LOOKING FOR A PEN PAL I 'M LOOKING FOR A HUSBAND
AmyWebb_2013S I WANTED SOMEBODY WHO WORKED HARD BECAUSE WORK FOR ME IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUT NOT TOO HARD FOR ME THE HOBBIES THAT I HAVE ARE REALLY JUST NEW WORK PROJECTS THAT I 'VE LAUNCHED
AmyWebb_2013S I ALSO WANTED SOMEBODY WHO NOT ONLY WANTED TWO CHILDREN BUT WAS GOING TO HAVE THE SAME ATTITUDE TOWARD PARENTING THAT I DO SO SOMEBODY WHO WAS GOING TO BE TOTALLY OKAY WITH FORCING OUR CHILD TO START TAKING PIANO LESSONS AT AGE THREE
AmyWebb_2013S AND ALSO MAYBE COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASSES IF WE COULD WRANGLE IT SO THINGS LIKE THAT BUT I ALSO WANTED SOMEBODY WHO WOULD GO TO FAR FLUNG EXOTIC PLACES LIKE PETRA JORDAN
AmyWebb_2013S INTO A TOP TIER AND A SECOND TIER OF POINTS AND I RANKED EVERYTHING STARTING AT ONE HUNDRED AND GOING ALL THE WAY DOWN TO NINETY ONE
AmyWebb_2013S I FIGURED THERE WOULD BE A MINIMUM OF SEVEN HUNDRED POINTS BEFORE I WOULD AGREE TO EMAIL SOMEBODY OR RESPOND TO AN EMAIL MESSAGE FOR NINE HUNDRED POINTS I 'D AGREE TO GO OUT ON A DATE AND I WOULDN 'T EVEN CONSIDER ANY KIND OF RELATIONSHIP BEFORE SOMEBODY HAD CROSSED THE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED POINT THRESHOLD
AmyWebb_2013S WHO ARE ALL OF THE OTHER WOMEN ON THESE DATING SITES
AmyWebb_2013S AT THIS MOMENT I KNEW CLICKING AFTER PROFILE AFTER PROFILE AFTER PROFILE THAT LOOKED LIKE THIS THAT I NEEDED TO DO SOME MARKET RESEARCH SO I CREATED TEN FAKE MALE PROFILES NOW
AmyWebb_2013S BEFORE I LOSE ALL OF YOU
AmyWebb_2013S AND MAINLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT WAS TWO DIFFERENT DATA SETS SO I WAS LOOKING AT QUALITATIVE DATA SO WHAT WAS THE HUMOR THE TONE THE VOICE THE COMMUNICATION STYLE THAT THESE WOMEN SHARED IN COMMON AND ALSO QUANTITATIVE DATA SO WHAT WAS THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF THEIR PROFILE HOW MUCH TIME WAS SPENT BETWEEN MESSAGES
AmyWebb_2013S WELL ONE MONTH LATER I HAD
AmyWebb_2013S A LOT OF DATA AND I WAS ABLE TO DO ANOTHER ANALYSIS AND AS IT TURNS OUT
AmyWebb_2013S CONTENT MATTERS A LOT SO SMART PEOPLE TEND TO WRITE A LOT THREE THOUSAND FOUR THOUSAND FIVE THOUSAND WORDS ABOUT THEMSELVES WHICH MAY ALL BE VERY VERY INTERESTING
AmyWebb_2013S THE CHALLENGE HERE THOUGH IS THAT THE POPULAR MEN AND WOMEN ARE STICKING TO NINETY SEVEN WORDS ON AVERAGE THAT ARE WRITTEN VERY VERY WELL EVEN THOUGH IT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE IT ALL THE TIME
AmyWebb_2013S THE OTHER SORT OF HALLMARK OF THE PEOPLE WHO DO THIS WELL IS THAT THEY 'RE USING NON SPECIFIC LANGUAGE SO IN MY CASE YOU KNOW THE ENGLISH PATIENT IS MY MOST FAVORITE MOVIE EVER
AmyWebb_2013S ALSO OPTIMISTIC LANGUAGE MATTERS A LOT SO THIS IS A WORD CLOUD HIGHLIGHTING THE MOST POPULAR WORDS THAT WERE USED BY THE MOST POPULAR WOMEN WORDS LIKE FUN AND GIRL AND LOVE
AmyWebb_2013S AND WHAT I REALIZED WAS NOT THAT I HAD TO DUMB DOWN MY OWN PROFILE REMEMBER I 'M SOMEBODY WHO SAID THAT I SPEAK FLUENT JAPANESE AND I KNOW JAVASCRIPT AND I WAS OKAY WITH THAT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IT 'S ABOUT BEING MORE APPROACHABLE AND HELPING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE BEST WAY TO REACH OUT TO YOU
AmyWebb_2013S AND AS IT TURNS OUT TIMING IS ALSO REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE ACCESS TO SOMEBODY 'S MOBILE PHONE NUMBER OR THEIR INSTANT MESSAGE ACCOUNT
AmyWebb_2013S AND IT 'S TWO O 'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND YOU HAPPEN TO BE AWAKE DOESN 'T MEAN THAT THAT 'S A GOOD TIME TO COMMUNICATE WITH THOSE PEOPLE
AmyWebb_2013S THE POPULAR WOMEN ON THESE ONLINE SITES SPEND AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY THREE HOURS IN BETWEEN EACH COMMUNICATION AND THAT 'S WHAT WE WOULD NORMALLY DO IN THE USUAL PROCESS OF COURTSHIP AND FINALLY
AmyWebb_2013S WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE IN SHARP CONTRAST TO WHAT I HAD UPLOADED
AmyWebb_2013S ONCE I HAD ALL OF THIS INFORMATION I WAS ABLE TO CREATE A SUPER PROFILE SO IT WAS STILL ME
AmyWebb_2013S BUT IT WAS ME OPTIMIZED NOW FOR THIS ECOSYSTEM
AmyWebb_2013S AND AS IT TURNS OUT
AmyWebb_2013S I DID A REALLY GOOD JOB
AmyWebb_2013S I WAS THE MOST POPULAR PERSON ONLINE
AmyWebb_2013S AND I SAID WELL ACTUALLY I 'M NOT GOING TO GO OUT WITH ANYBODY
AmyWebb_2013S BECAUSE REMEMBER IN MY SCORING SYSTEM THEY HAVE TO REACH A MINIMUM THRESHOLD OF SEVEN HUNDRED POINTS AND NONE OF THEM HAVE DONE THAT
AmyWebb_2013S WELL NOT TOO LONG AFTER THAT I FOUND THIS GUY
AmyWebb_2013S WHICH I THOUGHT WAS VERY CLEVER
AmyWebb_2013S HE TALKED IN DETAIL ABOUT TRAVEL HE MADE A LOT OF REALLY INTERESTING CULTURAL REFERENCES HE LOOKED AND TALKED EXACTLY LIKE WHAT I WANTED AND IMMEDIATELY HE SCORED EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY POINTS IT WAS ENOUGH FOR A DATE
AmyWebb_2013S THREE WEEKS LATER WE MET UP IN PERSON FOR WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE A FOURTEEN HOUR LONG CONVERSATION THAT WENT FROM COFFEE SHOP TO RESTAURANT TO ANOTHER COFFEE SHOP TO ANOTHER RESTAURANT AND WHEN HE DROPPED ME BACK OFF AT MY HOUSE THAT NIGHT I RE SCORED HIM
AmyWebb_2013S WELL A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER THAT WE WERE NON CRUISE SHIP TRAVELING THROUGH PETRA JORDAN
AmyWebb_2013S WHEN HE GOT DOWN ON HIS KNEE AND PROPOSED
AmyWebb_2013S A YEAR AFTER THAT WE WERE MARRIED AND ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER THAT OUR DAUGHTER PETRA WAS BORN
AmyWebb_2013S IN FACT IT 'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WRITE YOURSELF SO WHETHER YOU 'RE LOOKING FOR A HUSBAND OR A WIFE OR YOU 'RE TRYING TO FIND YOUR PASSION OR YOU 'RE TRYING TO START A BUSINESS ALL YOU HAVE TO REALLY DO IS FIGURE OUT YOUR OWN FRAMEWORK
AmyWebb_2013S AND PLAY BY YOUR OWN RULES AND FEEL FREE TO BE AS PICKY AS YOU WANT
AmyWebb_2013S WELL ON MY WEDDING DAY I HAD A CONVERSATION AGAIN WITH MY GRANDMOTHER AND SHE SAID
AmyWebb_2013S ALL RIGHT MAYBE I WAS WRONG IT LOOKS LIKE YOU DID COME UP WITH A REALLY REALLY GREAT SYSTEM
