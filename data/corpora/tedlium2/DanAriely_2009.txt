DanAriely_2009@19.16:24.30 I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PREDICTABLE IRRATIONALITY
DanAriely_2009@31.67:33.33 WAS BURNED VERY BADLY
DanAriely_2009@35.49:41.67 AND IF YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN HOSPITAL YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF TYPES OF IRRATIONALITIES
DanAriely_2009@42.29:50.25 THE ONE THAT PARTICULARLY BOTHERED ME IN THE BURN DEPARTMENT WAS THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE NURSES TOOK THE BANDAGES OFF
DanAriely_2009@51.18:59.10 NOW YOU MUST HAVE ALL TAKEN A BAND AID OFF AT SOME POINT AND YOU MUST HAVE WONDERED WHAT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH DO YOU RIP IT OFF QUICKLY SHORT DURATION
DanAriely_2009@60.81:68.84 YOU TAKE YOUR BAND AID OFF SLOWLY YOU TAKE A LONG TIME BUT EACH SECOND IS NOT AS PAINFUL WHICH ONE OF THOSE IS THE RIGHT APPROACH
DanAriely_2009@69.82:70.88 THE NURSES IN MY
DanAriely_2009@72.50:81.80 THOUGHT THAT THE RIGHT APPROACH WAS THE RIPPING ONE SO THEY WOULD GRAB HOLD AND THEY WOULD RIP AND THEY WOULD GRAB HOLD AND THEY WOULD RIP AND BECAUSE I HAD SEVENTY PERCENT OF MY BODY BURNED IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT AN HOUR
DanAriely_2009@89.89:98.34 TO REASON WITH THEM AND SAY WHY DON'T WE TRY SOMETHING ELSE WHY DON'T WE TAKE IT A LITTLE LONGER MAYBE TWO HOURS INSTEAD OF AN HOUR AND HAVE LESS OF THIS INTENSITY
DanAriely_2009@99.43:108.10 AND THE NURSES TOLD ME TWO THINGS THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD THE RIGHT MODEL OF THE PATIENT THAT THEY KNEW WHAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO MINIMIZE MY PAIN
DanAriely_2009@114.83:118.49 THIS IS NOT JUST IN HEBREW BY THE WAY IT'S IN EVERY LANGUAGE I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH SO FAR
DanAriely_2009@119.87:127.74 AND YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT MUCH THERE WASN'T MUCH I COULD DO AND THEY KEPT ON DOING WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND ABOUT THREE YEARS LATER WHEN I LEFT THE HOSPITAL
DanAriely_2009@128.34:130.06 I STARTED STUDYING AT THE UNIVERSITY
DanAriely_2009@131.35:134.50 THE MOST INTERESTING LESSONS I LEARNED WAS THAT
DanAriely_2009@135.32:145.79 THERE IS AN EXPERIMENTAL METHOD THAT IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION YOU CAN CREATE A REPLICA OF THIS QUESTION IN SOME ABSTRACT WAY AND YOU CAN TRY TO EXAMINE THIS QUESTION MAYBE LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT THE WORLD
DanAriely_2009@157.46:158.95 A CARPENTER 'S VICE
DanAriely_2009@166.76:174.38 AND I WOULD CRUNCH IT FOR LONG PERIODS AND SHORT PERIODS AND PAIN THAT WENT UP AND PAIN THAT WENT DOWN AND WITH BREAKS AND WITHOUT BREAKS ALL KINDS OF VERSIONS OF PAIN
DanAriely_2009@175.07:183.44 AND WHEN I FINISHED HURTING PEOPLE A LITTLE BIT I WOULD ASK THEM SO HOW PAINFUL WAS THIS OR HOW PAINFUL WAS THIS OR IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE LAST TWO WHICH ONE WOULD YOU CHOOSE
DanAriely_2009@186.93:188.94 I KEPT ON DOING THIS FOR A WHILE
DanAriely_2009@191.69:197.69 AND THEN LIKE ALL GOOD ACADEMIC PROJECTS I GOT MORE FUNDING I MOVED TO SOUNDS ELECTRICAL SHOCKS
DanAriely_2009@198.76:202.84 I EVEN HAD A PAIN SUIT THAT COULD GET PEOPLE TO FEEL MUCH MORE PAIN
DanAriely_2009@204.88:208.90 BUT AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS WHAT I LEARNED WAS THAT THE NURSES WERE WRONG
DanAriely_2009@210.99:218.39 WONDERFUL PEOPLE WITH GOOD INTENTIONS AND PLENTY OF EXPERIENCE AND NEVERTHELESS THEY WERE GETTING THINGS WRONG PREDICTABLY ALL THE TIME
DanAriely_2009@218.72:228.21 IT TURNS OUT THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T ENCODE DURATION IN THE WAY THAT WE ENCODE INTENSITY I WOULD HAVE HAD LESS PAIN IF THE DURATION WOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER AND THE INTENSITY
DanAriely_2009@228.68:238.24 WAS LOWER IT TURNS OUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO START WITH MY FACE WHICH WAS MUCH MORE PAINFUL AND MOVE TOWARDS MY LEGS GIVING ME A TREND OF IMPROVEMENT OVER TIME THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALSO LESS PAINFUL
DanAriely_2009@254.02:257.24 CASE AND IT TURNS OUT IT'S A MORE GENERAL CASE THERE'S A LOT OF
DanAriely_2009@258.08:259.38 MISTAKES WE DO
DanAriely_2009@275.76:284.49 MY INTEREST IN CHEATING STARTED WHEN ENRON CAME ON THE SCENE EXPLODED ALL OF A SUDDEN AND I STARTED THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IS IT THE CASE THAT THERE WAS KIND OF A FEW BAD APPLES
DanAriely_2009@285.64:291.87 CAPABLE OF DOING THESE THINGS OR ARE WE TALKING A MORE ENDEMIC SITUATION THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY CAPABLE OF BEHAVING THIS WAY
DanAriely_2009@292.68:305.53 SO LIKE WE USUALLY DO I DECIDED TO DO A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT AND HERE 'S HOW IT WENT IF YOU WERE IN THE EXPERIMENT I WOULD PASS YOU A SHEET OF PAPER WITH TWENTY SIMPLE MATH PROBLEMS THAT EVERYBODY COULD SOLVE BUT I WOULDN'T GIVE YOU ENOUGH TIME
DanAriely_2009@317.64:330.06 OTHER PEOPLE I WOULD TEMPT TO CHEAT I WOULD PASS THEIR SHEET OF PAPER WHEN THE FIVE MINUTES WERE OVER I WOULD SAY PLEASE SHRED THE PIECE OF PAPER PUT THE LITTLE PIECES IN YOUR POCKET OR IN YOUR BACKPACK AND TELL ME HOW MANY QUESTIONS YOU GOT CORRECTLY
DanAriely_2009@335.53:337.00 NOW IT WASN'T AS IF
DanAriely_2009@345.43:352.89 NOW IN ECONOMIC THEORY CHEATING IS A VERY SIMPLE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS YOU SAY WHAT'S THE PROBABILITY OF BEING CAUGHT
DanAriely_2009@353.27:364.09 HOW MUCH DO I STAND TO GAIN FROM CHEATING AND HOW MUCH PUNISHMENT WOULD I GET IF I GET CAUGHT AND YOU WEIGH THESE OPTIONS OUT YOU DO THE SIMPLE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND YOU DECIDE WHETHER IT'S WORTHWHILE TO COMMIT THE CRIME OR NOT
DanAriely_2009@364.67:377.08 SO WE TRY TO TEST THIS FOR SOME PEOPLE WE VARIED HOW MUCH MONEY THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH HOW MUCH MONEY THEY COULD STEAL WE PAID THEM TEN CENTS PER CORRECT QUESTION FIFTY CENTS A DOLLAR FIVE DOLLARS TEN DOLLARS PER CORRECT QUESTION
DanAriely_2009@378.11:386.96 YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT AS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THE TABLE INCREASES PEOPLE WOULD CHEAT MORE BUT IN FACT IT WASN'T THE CASE WE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE CHEATING BY STEALING BY A LITTLE BIT
DanAriely_2009@387.77:389.71 WHAT ABOUT THE PROBABILITY OF BEING CAUGHT
DanAriely_2009@390.20:393.16 SOME PEOPLE SHREDDED HALF THE SHEET OF PAPER SO THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE LEFT
DanAriely_2009@401.61:413.10 YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT AS THE PROBABILITY OF BEING CAUGHT GOES DOWN PEOPLE WOULD CHEAT MORE BUT AGAIN THIS WAS NOT THE CASE AGAIN A LOT OF PEOPLE CHEATED BY JUST BY A LITTLE BIT AND THEY WERE INSENSITIVE TO THESE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES
DanAriely_2009@421.85:433.71 AND WE THOUGHT MAYBE WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT THERE ARE TWO FORCES AT ONE HAND WE ALL WANT TO LOOK AT OURSELVES IN THE MIRROR AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT OURSELVES SO WE DON'T WANT TO CHEAT ON THE OTHER HAND WE CAN CHEAT A LITTLE BIT AND STILL FEEL GOOD ABOUT OURSELVES
DanAriely_2009@434.01:446.61 SO MAYBE WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT THERE'S A LEVEL OF CHEATING WE CAN'T GO OVER BUT WE CAN STILL BENEFIT FROM CHEATING AT A LOW DEGREE AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T CHANGE OUR IMPRESSIONS ABOUT OURSELVES WE CALL THIS LIKE A PERSONAL FUDGE FACTOR
DanAriely_2009@448.76:450.15 NOW HOW WOULD YOU TEST
DanAriely_2009@450.54:455.33 A PERSONAL FUDGE FACTOR INITIALLY WE SAID WHAT CAN WE DO TO SHRINK THE FUDGE FACTOR
DanAriely_2009@456.31:466.08 SO WE GOT PEOPLE TO THE LAB AND WE SAID WE HAVE TWO TASKS FOR YOU TODAY FIRST WE ASKED HALF THE PEOPLE TO RECALL EITHER TEN BOOKS THEY READ IN HIGH SCHOOL OR TO RECALL THE TEN COMMANDMENTS
DanAriely_2009@475.65:480.26 BUT THOSE PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO RECALL THE TEN COMMANDMENTS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHEAT DID NOT CHEAT AT ALL
DanAriely_2009@489.39:500.36 THE MOMENT PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT TRYING TO RECALL THE TEN COMMANDMENTS THEY STOPPED CHEATING IN FACT EVEN WHEN WE GAVE SELF DECLARED ATHEISTS THE TASK OF SWEARING ON THE BIBLE AND WE GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO CHEAT THEY
DanAriely_2009@504.39:510.15 NOW TEN COMMANDMENTS IS SOMETHING THAT IS HARD TO BRING INTO THE EDUCATION SYSTEM SO WE SAID WHY DON'T WE GET PEOPLE TO SIGN THE HONOR CODE
DanAriely_2009@510.95:512.97 WE GOT PEOPLE TO SIGN I UNDERSTAND THAT
DanAriely_2009@513.78:516.99 SURVEY FALLS UNDER THE MIT HONOR CODE THEN THEY SHREDDED IT
DanAriely_2009@517.58:518.92 NO CHEATING WHATSOEVER
DanAriely_2009@527.98:530.74 SO ALL THIS WAS ABOUT DECREASING THE FUDGE FACTOR
DanAriely_2009@531.69:533.38 WHAT ABOUT INCREASING THE FUDGE FACTOR
DanAriely_2009@534.24:545.49 THE FIRST EXPERIMENT I WALKED AROUND MIT AND I DISTRIBUTED SIX PACKS OF COKES IN THE REFRIGERATORS THESE WERE COMMON REFRIGERATORS FOR THE UNDERGRADS AND I CAME BACK TO MEASURE WHAT WE TECHNICALLY CALL THE HALF LIFETIME OF COKE
DanAriely_2009@545.83:557.55 HOW LONG DOES IT LAST IN THE REFRIGERATORS AS YOU CAN EXPECT IT DOESN'T LAST VERY LONG PEOPLE TAKE IT IN CONTRAST I TOOK A PLATE WITH SIX ONE DOLLAR BILLS AND I LEFT THOSE PLATES IN THE SAME REFRIGERATORS
DanAriely_2009@558.32:564.06 NO BILL EVER DISAPPEARED NOW THIS IS NOT A GOOD SOCIAL SCIENCE EXPERIMENT SO TO DO IT BETTER
DanAriely_2009@564.72:577.33 I DID THE SAME EXPERIMENT AS I DESCRIBED TO YOU BEFORE A THIRD OF THE PEOPLE WE PASSED THE SHEET THEY GAVE IT BACK TO US A THIRD OF THE PEOPLE WE PASSED IT TO THEY SHREDDED IT THEY CAME TO US AND SAID MISTER EXPERIMENTER I SOLVED X PROBLEMS GIVE ME X DOLLARS
DanAriely_2009@577.78:587.51 A THIRD OF THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY FINISHED SHREDDING THE PIECE OF PAPER THEY CAME TO US AND SAID MISTER EXPERIMENTER I SOLVED X PROBLEMS GIVE ME X TOKENS
DanAriely_2009@587.96:601.75 WE DID NOT PAY THEM WITH DOLLARS WE PAID THEM WITH SOMETHING ELSE AND THEN THEY TOOK THE SOMETHING ELSE THEY WALKED TWELVE FEET TO THE SIDE AND EXCHANGED IT FOR DOLLARS THINK ABOUT THE FOLLOWING INTUITION HOW BAD WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT TAKING A PENCIL FROM WORK HOME
DanAriely_2009@617.63:619.98 TELL YOU WHAT I THINK ABOUT THIS AND THE STOCK MARKET IN A MINUTE
DanAriely_2009@621.82:635.50 BUT THIS DID NOT SOLVE THE BIG PROBLEM I HAD WITH ENRON YET BECAUSE IN ENRON THERE'S ALSO A SOCIAL ELEMENT PEOPLE SEE EACH OTHER BEHAVING IN FACT EVERY DAY WHEN WE OPEN THE NEWS WE SEE EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE CHEATING WHAT DOES THIS CAUSE US
DanAriely_2009@635.95:649.34 SO WE DID ANOTHER EXPERIMENT WE GOT A BIG GROUP OF STUDENTS TO BE IN THE EXPERIMENT AND WE PREPAID THEM SO EVERYBODY GOT AN ENVELOPE WITH ALL THE MONEY FOR THE EXPERIMENT AND WE TOLD THEM THAT AT THE END WE ASKED THEM TO PAY US BACK THE MONEY THEY DIDN'T MAKE
DanAriely_2009@650.03:659.38 OK THE SAME THING HAPPENS WHEN WE GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHEAT THEY CHEAT THEY CHEAT JUST BY A LITTLE BIT BUT ALL THE SAME BUT IN THIS EXPERIMENT WE ALSO HIRED AN ACTING STUDENT
DanAriely_2009@660.29:666.50 ACTING STUDENT STOOD UP AFTER THIRTY SECONDS AND SAID I SOLVED EVERYTHING WHAT DO I DO NOW
DanAriely_2009@675.29:685.42 WAS A PART OF THE GROUP NOBODY KNEW IT WAS AN ACTOR AND THEY CLEARLY CHEATED IN A VERY VERY SERIOUS WAY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE GROUP
DanAriely_2009@685.81:688.13 WILL THEY CHEAT MORE OR WILL THEY CHEAT LESS
DanAriely_2009@690.44:694.87 HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS IT TURNS OUT IT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF SWEATSHIRT THEY'RE WEARING
DanAriely_2009@696.36:699.62 HERE IS THE THING WE RAN THIS AT CARNEGIE MELLON AND PITTSBURGH
DanAriely_2009@701.76:709.19 BIG UNIVERSITIES CARNEGIE MELLON AND UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH ALL OF THE SUBJECTS SITTING IN THE EXPERIMENT WERE CARNEGIE MELLON STUDENTS
DanAriely_2009@709.52:717.68 WHEN THE ACTOR WHO WAS GETTING UP WAS A CARNEGIE MELLON STUDENT HE WAS ACTUALLY A CARNEGIE MELLON STUDENT BUT HE WAS A PART OF THEIR GROUP
DanAriely_2009@719.91:724.09 BUT WHEN HE ACTUALLY HAD A UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH SWEATSHIRT CHEATING WENT DOWN
DanAriely_2009@746.79:759.42 SOMEBODY FROM OUR IN GROUP CHEATS AND WE SEE THEM CHEATING WE FEEL IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE AS A GROUP TO BEHAVE THIS WAY BUT IF IT'S SOMEBODY FROM ANOTHER GROUP THESE TERRIBLE PEOPLE I MEAN NOT TERRIBLE IN THIS BUT SOMEBODY WE DON'T WANT TO ASSOCIATE OURSELF WITH
DanAriely_2009@769.55:774.09 LESS SO WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED FROM THIS ABOUT CHEATING
DanAriely_2009@774.89:779.37 WE'VE LEARNED THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN CHEAT THEY CHEAT JUST BY A LITTLE BIT
DanAriely_2009@784.26:786.90 WHEN WE GET BIGGER DISTANCE FROM CHEATING
DanAriely_2009@788.04:796.55 FROM THE OBJECT OF MONEY FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE CHEAT MORE AND WHEN WE SEE CHEATING AROUND US PARTICULARLY IF IT'S A PART OF OUR IN GROUP CHEATING GOES UP
DanAriely_2009@797.34:808.90 NOW IF WE THINK ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF THE STOCK MARKET THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHAT HAPPENS IN A SITUATION WHEN YOU CREATE SOMETHING WHERE YOU PAY PEOPLE A LOT OF MONEY TO SEE REALITY IN A SLIGHTLY DISTORTED WAY
DanAriely_2009@809.47:811.53 WOULD THEY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT THIS WAY
DanAriely_2009@811.95:820.41 OF COURSE THEY WOULD WHAT HAPPEN WHEN YOU DO OTHER THINGS LIKE YOU REMOVE THINGS FROM MONEY YOU CALL THEM STOCK OR STOCK OPTIONS DERIVATIVES MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES
DanAriely_2009@820.74:828.21 COULD IT BE THAT WITH THOSE MORE DISTANT THINGS IT'S NOT A TOKEN FOR ONE SECOND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS MANY STEPS REMOVED FROM MONEY FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME
DanAriely_2009@830.79:841.41 EVEN MORE AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT WHEN PEOPLE SEE OTHER PEOPLE BEHAVE AROUND THEM I THINK ALL OF THOSE FORCES WORK IN A VERY BAD WAY IN THE STOCK
DanAriely_2009@844.32:845.79 I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT
DanAriely_2009@852.27:862.84 AND THE POINT IS THAT MANY OF THESE INTUITIONS ARE WRONG THE QUESTION IS ARE WE GOING TO TEST THOSE INTUITIONS WE CAN THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO TEST THIS INTUITION IN OUR PRIVATE LIFE IN OUR BUSINESS LIFE
DanAriely_2009@863.34:876.91 MOST PARTICULARLY WHEN IT GOES TO POLICY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND WHEN YOU CREATE NEW STOCK MARKETS WHEN YOU CREATE OTHER POLICIES TAXATION HEALTH CARE AND SO ON AND THE DIFFICULTY OF TESTING OUR INTUITION WAS THE
DanAriely_2009@877.34:884.45 LESSON I LEARNED WHEN I WENT BACK TO THE NURSES TO TALK TO THEM SO I WENT BACK TO TALK TO THEM AND TELL THEM WHAT I FOUND OUT ABOUT REMOVING BANDAGES
DanAriely_2009@885.27:892.71 AND I LEARNED TWO INTERESTING THINGS ONE WAS THAT MY FAVORITE NURSE ETTIE TOLD ME THAT I DID NOT TAKE HER PAIN INTO CONSIDERATION
DanAriely_2009@893.22:901.65 SHE SAID OF COURSE YOU KNOW IT WAS VERY PAINFUL FOR YOU BUT THINK ABOUT ME AS A NURSE TAKING REMOVING THE BANDAGES OF SOMEBODY I LIKED AND HAD TO DO IT REPEATEDLY OVER A LONG PERIOD OF
DanAriely_2009@914.94:919.60 I DID NOT THINK THAT YOUR INTUITION WAS RIGHT I FELT MY INTUITION WAS CORRECT
DanAriely_2009@919.99:930.20 SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT ALL OF YOUR INTUITIONS IT'S VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT YOUR INTUITION IS WRONG AND SHE SAID GIVEN THE FACT THAT I THOUGHT MY INTUITION WAS RIGHT SHE THOUGHT HER INTUITION WAS RIGHT
DanAriely_2009@930.45:937.07 IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR HER TO ACCEPT DOING A DIFFICULT EXPERIMENT TO TRY AND CHECK WHETHER SHE WAS WRONG
DanAriely_2009@937.72:946.74 BUT IN FACT THIS IS THE SITUATION WE'RE ALL IN ALL THE TIME WE HAVE VERY STRONG INTUITIONS ABOUT ALL KINDS OF THINGS OUR OWN ABILITY HOW THE ECONOMY
DanAriely_2009@947.36:954.92 HOW WE SHOULD PAY SCHOOL TEACHERS BUT UNLESS WE START TESTING THOSE INTUITIONS WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO BETTER AND JUST THINK ABOUT HOW BETTER
