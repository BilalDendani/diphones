EleniGabreMadhin_2007G YOU KNOW THERE'S A SMALL COUNTRY NESTLED IN THE HIMALAYAN MOUNTAINS FAR FROM THESE BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAINS WHERE THE PEOPLE OF THE KINGDOM OF BHUTAN HAVE DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT WHICH IS TO MEASURE THEIR GROSS NATIONAL HAPPINESS RATHER THAN THEIR GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G AND WHY NOT AFTER ALL HAPPINESS IS NOT JUST A PRIVILEGE FOR THE LUCKY FEW BUT A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT FOR ALL AND WHAT IS HAPPINESS HAPPINESS IS THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G THE FREEDOM TO CHOSE WHERE TO LIVE WHAT TO DO WHAT TO BUY WHAT TO SELL FROM WHOM TO WHOM WHEN AND HOW
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G DOES CHOICE COME FROM AND WHO GETS TO EXPRESS IT AND HOW DO WE EXPRESS IT WELL ONE WAY TO EXPRESS CHOICE IS THROUGH THE MARKET
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G WELL FUNCTIONING MARKETS PROVIDE CHOICES AND ULTIMATELY THE ABILITY TO EXPRESS ONE 'S PURSUIT FOR HAPPINESS THE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G GREAT INDIAN ECONOMIST AMARTYA SEN WAS AWARDED THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR DEMONSTRATING THAT FAMINE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G IS NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF FOOD SUPPLY BUT RATHER THE ABILITY TO ACQUIRE OR ENTITLE ONESELF TO THAT FOOD THROUGH THE MARKET
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G NOT BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH FOOD BECAUSE THERE WAS ACTUALLY A SURPLUS OF FOOD IN THE FERTILE REGIONS OF THE SOUTH PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G BUT BECAUSE IN THE NORTH PEOPLE COULD NOT ACCESS OR ENTITLE THEMSELVES TO THAT FOOD THAT WAS A TURNING POINT FOR MY LIFE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G EIGHT TIMES MORE TRACTORS IN LATIN AMERICA AND THREE TIMES MORE TRACTORS IN ASIA THAN IN AFRICA
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G THE SMALL FARMER IN AFRICA TODAY LIVES A LIFE WITHOUT MUCH CHOICE AND THEREFORE WITHOUT MUCH FREEDOM HIS LIVELIHOOD IS PREDETERMINED
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G BY THE CONDITIONS OF GRINDING POVERTY HE COMES TO THE MARKET WHEN PRICES ARE LOWEST WITH THE MEAGER FRUITS OF HIS HARD LABOR
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G JUST AFTER THE HARVEST BECAUSE HE HAS NO CHOICE SHE COMES BACK TO THE MARKET SOME MONTHS LATER WHEN PRICES ARE HIGHEST IN WHAT WE CALL THE LEAN SEASON WHEN FOOD IS SCARCE BECAUSE SHE HAS TO FEED HER FAMILY AND HAS NO CHOICE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW CAN MARKETS BE DEVELOPED IN RURAL AFRICA TO HARNESS THE POWER OF INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G MEANING IN FACT THAT FARMERS ARE RATIONAL AND PROFIT MINDED JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WELL WE DON'T NEED NOW ANY MORE NOBEL PRIZES TO KNOW THAT FARMERS WANT A FAIR SHAKE AT THE MARKET AND WANT TO MAKE MONEY JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G AND ONE THING IS CLEAR WHICH IS AT LEAST NOW WE KNOW THAT AFRICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS AND THAT BUSINESS IS AGRICULTURE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G WHICH THEY DID RATHER INEFFICIENTLY AND LET THE PRIVATE MARKET DO IT'S MAGIC WELL WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS DID AFRICA FEED ITSELF
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G DID OUR FARMERS TURN INTO HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE COMMERCIAL ACTORS I THINK WE'RE ALL IN THIS ROOM PROBABLY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IN FACT AFRICA IS THE ONLY REGION IN THE WORLD
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G HUNGER AND MALNUTRITION ARE PROJECTED TO GO UP OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS WHERE THE FOOD IMPORT BILL IS NOW DOUBLE WHAT IT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G WHERE FOOD PRODUCTION PER CAPITA HAS STAGNATED AND WHERE FERTILIZER USE HAS DECLINED RATHER THAN INCREASED
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G SO WHY DIDN'T AGRICULTURE MARKETS PERFORM TO EXPECTATIONS THE MARKET REFORMS PROMPTED BY THE WEST AND I'VE SPENT
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G SOME FIFTEEN YEARS TRAVELING AROUND THE CONTINENT DOING RESEARCH ON AGRICULTURAL MARKETS AND HAVE INTERVIEWED TRADERS
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G TEN TO FIFTEEN COUNTRIES IN THIS CONTINENT HUNDREDS OF TRADERS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WENT WRONG WITH OUR MARKET REFORM
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE REFORMS MIGHT HAVE THROWN THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH WATER LIKE ITS AGRICULTURE AFRICA 'S MARKETS ARE HIGHLY UNDER CAPITALIZED AND INEFFICIENT
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G WE KNOW FROM OUR WORK AROUND THE CONTINENT THAT TRANSACTION COSTS OF REACHING THE MARKET AND THE RISKS OF TRANSACTING IN RURAL AGRICULTURE MARKETS ARE EXTREMELY HIGH
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G IN FACT ONLY ONE THIRD OF AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT PRODUCED IN AFRICA EVEN REACHES THE MARKET AFRICA 'S MARKETS ARE WEAK NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF WEAK INFRASTRUCTURE IN TERMS OF ROADS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUT ALSO BECAUSE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G OF THE VIRTUAL ABSENCE OF NECESSARY MARKET INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS MARKET INFORMATION GRADES AND STANDARDS AND RELIABLE WAYS TO CONNECT BUYERS AND SELLERS
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G AS GRAIN CHANGES HANDS AND I'VE MEASURED THAT IT CHANGES HANDS FOUR FIVE TIMES IN IT'S TRAJECTORY FROM THE FARMER TO THE CONSUMER
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G ACTUALLY HAS HUGE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ABILITY OF MARKETS TO QUICKLY RESPOND TO PRICE SIGNALS AND SITUATIONS WHERE THERE ARE DEFICITS FOR EXAMPLE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G IT ALSO HAS VERY HIGH COST IMPLICATIONS I HAVE MEASURED THAT TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF THE MARKETING MARGIN IS SIMPLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF GRADES AND STANDARDS
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G AND MARKET INFORMATION SACKS HAVE TO BE CONSTANTLY CHANGED AND THIS LEADS TO VERY HIGH HANDLING COSTS FOR
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G SMALL FARMERS WHO PRODUCE THE BULK OF OUR AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT IN AFRICA COME TO THE MARKET WITH VIRTUALLY NO INFORMATION AT ALL BLIND TRUSTING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME SORT OF DEMAND FOR THEIR
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G AND COMPLETELY AT THE MERCY OF THE MERCHANTS IN THE ONLY MARKET THE NEAREST LOCAL MARKET THEY KNOW WHERE THEY'RE UNABLE TO NEGOTIATE BETTER PRICES OR REDUCE THEIR
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G AFRICA SMALL FARMERS BEAR THE BRUNT OF THIS RISK IN FACT IN MY VIEW THERE IS NO REGION OF THE WORLD AND NO PERIOD IN HISTORY
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G THAT FARMERS HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO BEAR THE KIND OF MARKET RISK THAT AFRICA 'S FARMERS HAVE TO BEAR AND IN MY VIEW
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G THERE IS SIMPLY NO PLACE IN THE WORLD THAT HAS GROWN IT'S AGRICULTURE ON THE KIND OF RISK THAT OUR FARMERS IN AFRICA TODAY FACE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G IN ETHIOPIA FOR EXAMPLE THE VARIATION IN MAIZE PRICES FROM YEAR TO YEAR IS AS MUCH AS FIFTY PERCENT ANNUALLY THIS KIND OF MARKET RISK IS MIND BOGGLING AND HAS DIRECT IMPLICATIONS
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G FOR NOT ONLY THE INCENTIVES OF FARMERS TO INVEST IN HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS MODERN SEEDS AND FERTILIZERS BUT ALSO DIRECT IMPLICATIONS FOR FOOD SECURITY
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE AND TWO THOUSAND AND TWO ETHIOPIAN MAIZE FARMERS PRODUCED TWO YEARS OF BUMPER HARVEST THAT IN TURN BECAUSE OF THE WEAK MARKETING SYSTEM LED TO AN EIGHTY PERCENT COLLAPSE IN MAIZE PRICES IN THE COUNTRY
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G THIS MADE IT UNPROFITABLE FOR SOME FARMERS TO EVEN HARVEST THE GRAIN FROM THE FIELDS AND WE CALCULATED THAT SOME THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TONS OF GRAIN WAS LEFT IN THE FIELDS TO ROT IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND AND TWO
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G THAT YEAR IS IN THE AREAS WHERE THERE WERE GOOD RAINS
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G I'M NOT HERE TODAY TO LAMENT ABOUT THE SITUATION OR WRING MY HANDS I AM HERE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G TO TELL YOU THAT CHANGE IS IN THE AIR AFRICA TODAY IS NOT THE AFRICA WAITING FOR AID SOLUTIONS OR COOKIE CUTTER FOREIGN EXPERT POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G AFRICA HAS LEARNED OR IS LEARNING SOMEWHAT SLOWLY THAT MARKETS DON'T HAPPEN BY THEMSELVES IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES IT WAS VERY FASHIONABLE TO TALK ABOUT GETTING PRICES RIGHT THERE WAS A VERY INFLUENTIAL BOOK ABOUT THAT
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G BUT ALSO INVESTING IN THE RIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY INSTITUTIONS TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS TO UNLEASH THE POWER OF INNOVATION IN THE MARKET
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G WHEN CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT WE KNOW AND SEE THAT THAT INNOVATION IS READY TO EXPLODE IN RURAL AFRICA JUST LIKE ANYWHERE ELSE NEARLY THREE YEARS AGO
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G I DECIDED TO LEAVE MY COMFORTABLE JOB AS A WORLD BANK SENIOR ECONOMIST IN WASHINGTON AND COME BACK TO MY COUNTRY OF BIRTH ETHIOPIA AFTER NEARLY THIRTY YEARS ABROAD I DID SO FOR A SIMPLE REASON
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G I CURRENTLY LEAD IN ETHIOPIA AN EXCITING NEW INITIATIVE TO ESTABLISH THE FIRST ETHIOPIA COMMODITY EXCHANGE OR ECX NOW THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ITSELF
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G TO ESTABLISH A WAY TO TRADE BETTER AMONGST THEMSELVES THAT WAS OF COURSE THE BIRTH OF THE CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE WHICH IS THE MOST FAMOUS COMMODITY EXCHANGE IN THE WORLD
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G THE CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE WAS ESTABLISHED THEN FOR PRECISELY THE SAME REASONS THAT OUR FARMERS TODAY WOULD BENEFIT FROM A COMMODITY EXCHANGE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G NEED TO AVOID THESE HUGE RISKS AND TREMENDOUS LOSSES LED TO THE BIRTH OF THE FUTURES MARKET AND THE UNDERLYING SYSTEM OF GRADING GRAIN AND RECEIPTING ISSUING WAREHOUSE RECEIPTS ON THE BASIS OF WHICH TRADE COULD BE DONE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G FROM THERE THE GREATEST INNOVATION OF ALL CAME ABOUT IN THIS MARKET WHICH IS THAT BUYERS AND SELLERS COULD TRANSACT GRAIN WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING TO PHYSICALLY
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G OR VISUALLY INSPECT THE GRAIN THAT MEANT THAT GRAIN COULD BE TRADED ACROSS TREMENDOUS DISTANCES AND EVEN ACROSS TIME AS FAR FORWARD AS EIGHTEEN MONTHS INTO THE FUTURE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G THIS INNOVATION IS AT THE HEART OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE AND THE RISE OF CHICAGO TO A GLOBAL MARKET AGRICULTURAL MARKET SUPERPOWER FROM WHERE IT WAS A SMALL REGIONAL
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G NOW OVER THE LAST CENTURY WE TEND TO THINK OF COMMODITY EXCHANGES AS THE PURVIEW OF WESTERN INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES AND THAT THE REFERENCE PRICES FOR COTTON COFFEE COCOA PRODUCTS PRODUCED MAINLY IN THE SOUTH
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G ARE ACTUALLY A REFERENCE PRICE OR A PRICE DISCOVERED IN THESE ORGANIZED COMMODITY EXCHANGES IN THE NORTHERN COUNTRIES BUT
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G IS ACTUALLY CHANGING AND WE'RE SEEING A SHIFT POWERED
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G MAINLY BECAUSE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY A SHIFT IN MARKET DOMINANCE TOWARDS THE EMERGING MARKETS AND OVER THE LAST DECADE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G YOU SEE THAT THE SHARE OF WESTERN EXCHANGES AND THIS IS THE U S SHARE OF EXCHANGES IN THE WORLD HAS GONE DOWN BY NEARLY HALF IN JUST THE LAST DECADE SIMILARLY THERE'S BEEN EXPLOSIVE GROWTH
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G IN INDIA FOR EXAMPLE WHERE RURAL FARMERS ARE USING EXCHANGES GROWING HERE OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS BY TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PERCENT A YEAR
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G THIS IS POWERED BY LOW COST VSAT TECHNOLOGY AGGRESSIVELY TRYING TO REACH FARMERS TO BRING THEM INTO THE MARKET CHINA
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G THE FIRST ORGANIZED ETHIOPIA COMMODITY EXCHANGE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CUT AND PASTE THE CHICAGO MODEL OR THE INDIA MODEL BUT CREATING A SYSTEM UNIQUELY TAILORED TO ETHIOPIA 'S NEEDS AND REALITIES
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G SMALL FARMERS SO THE ECX IS AN ETHIOPIAN EXCHANGE FOR ETHIOPIA WE'RE CREATING A SYSTEM THAT SERVES ALL MARKET ACTORS
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G THAT CREATES INTEGRITY TRUST EFFICIENCY TRANSPARENCY AND ENABLES SMALL FARMERS TO MANAGE THE RISKS THAT I HAVE DESCRIBED
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G IN THE DESIGN OF OUR COMMODITY EXCHANGE IN ETHIOPIA WE'VE DONE SOMETHING RATHER UNIQUE WHICH IS TO TAKE THE APPROACH OF AN INTEGRATED PERSPECTIVE OR WHAT WE CALL THE ECX EDGE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G PRETTY MUCH CREATES THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM IN WHICH THE MARKET WILL DEVELOP ITSELF AND THIS IS BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE LAST
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G DECADE OF STUDYING MARKET DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA IS THAT THE PIECEMEAL APPROACH DOES NOT WORK YOU'VE GOT ONE DONOR TRYING TO DEVELOP MARKET INFORMATION
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G ANOTHER TRYING TO WORK ON OR SPONSOR GRADES AND STANDARDS ANOTHER ICT AND YET ANOTHER
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G SO THAT FARMERS AND SMALL TRADERS CAN ACTUALLY COME TO A TERMINAL CENTER WHAT WE CALL THE REMOTE ACCESS TERMINAL CENTERS
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G AND ACTUALLY WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY A COMPUTER OR FIGURE OUT HOW TO DIAL UP OR ANY OF THOSE THINGS SIMPLY SEE THE TRADING THAT'S HAPPENING ON THE ADDIS ABABA TRADING FLOOR
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G AND IN TURN WE'LL OPERATE AN IN HOUSE CLEARING SYSTEM TO ASSURE THAT PAYMENT IS DONE APPROPRIATELY IN THE RIGHT AMOUNT AND AT THE RIGHT TIME SO THAT BASICALLY WE CREATE TRUST AND INTEGRITY IN THE SYSTEM
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G THAT THE ECX WILL OPERATE A MARKET INFORMATION SYSTEM TO DISSEMINATE PRICES IN REAL TIME TO FARMERS AROUND THE COUNTRY USING VSAT TECHNOLOGY
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G TO BRING AN ELECTRONIC PRICE DISSEMINATION DIRECTLY TO FARMERS WHAT THIS DOES IS TRANSFORMS FUNDAMENTALLY THE FARMERS RELATIONSHIP TO THE MARKET
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G NOW FARMERS COME WITH KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT PRICES ARE AT THE NATIONAL MARKET AND THEY START TO THINK NATIONAL AND EVEN GLOBAL THEY START TO MAKE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G NOT ONLY COMMERCIAL MARKETING DECISIONS BUT ALSO PLANTING DECISIONS ON THE BASIS OF INFORMATION COMING FROM THE FUTURES PRICE MARKET
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G FROM DOING SIMPLE BACK TO BACK LIMITED ARBITRAGE TO REALLY THINKING STRATEGICALLY ABOUT HOW TO MOVE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G BUT IT WILL CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES WE BELIEVE THAT THIS INITIATIVE REQUIRES GREAT POLITICAL WILL AND WE'LL HAVE TO ALIGN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AS WELL AS THE ICT SECTOR AND REALLY EVEN THE UNDERLYING LEGAL FRAMEWORK
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G WE BELIEVE THAT THE WINDS OF CHANGE ARE HERE AND THAT WE CAN DO IT ECX IS THE MARKET FOR ETHIOPIA 'S NEW MILLENNIUM
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G WHICH STARTS IN ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS THE LAST PARLIAMENT OF OUR CENTURY OPENED WITH OUR PRESIDENT ANNOUNCING TO THE COUNTRY THAT THIS WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC INITIATIVE FOR THE COUNTRY TODAY
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G WE BELIEVE THAT THE STAKES ARE HIGH BUT THAT THE RETURNS WILL BE EVEN GREATER ECX MOREOVER CAN BECOME A TRADING PLATFORM
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G FOR A PAN AFRICAN MARKET IN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES ETHIOPIA 'S DOMESTIC MARKET IS ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF VALUE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G AND WE FEEL THAT OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IF ETHIOPIA CAN CAPTURE EVEN FORTY PERCENT JUST FORTY PERCENT OF THE DOMESTIC MARKET
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G AND ADD JUST TWENTY FIVE PERCENT VALUE TO THAT MARKET THE VALUE OF THE MARKET DOUBLES ETHIOPIA 'S AGRICULTURAL MARKET IS THIRTY PERCENT HIGHER THAN SOUTH AFRICA 'S
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G GRAIN PRODUCTION AND IN FACT ETHIOPIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST MAIZE PRODUCER IN AFRICA SO THE POTENTIAL IS THERE THE WILL IS THERE THE COMMITMENT IS THERE
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G WE FEEL THAT WE HAVE A WINNING VALUE PROPOSITION TO TRANSFORM FARMERS CHOICES TO GROW OUR AGRICULTURE AND TO CHANGE AFRICA
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G SO WE ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF FINDING OUR HAPPINESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
