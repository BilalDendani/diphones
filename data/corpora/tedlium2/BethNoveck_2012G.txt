BethNoveck_2012G@33.97:41.01 LATER IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY S UNDER PRESIDENT PIERCE HE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE REMARKED PROBABLY THE ONLY THING HE 'S KNOWN FOR
BethNoveck_2012G@41.01:52.12 WHEN A NEIGHBOR PASSED BY AND SAID I 'D LOVE TO SEE THE BEAUTIFUL HOUSE AND PIERCE SAID TO HIM WHY MY DEAR SIR OF COURSE YOU MAY COME IN THIS ISN 'T MY HOUSE IT IS THE PEOPLE 'S HOUSE
BethNoveck_2012G@60.23:71.67 BOMB BLAST CURTAINS COVERED MY WINDOWS WE WERE RUNNING WINDOWS TWO THOUSAND SOCIAL MEDIA WERE BLOCKED AT THE FIREWALL WE DIDN 'T HAVE A BLOG LET ALONE A DOZEN TWITTER ACCOUNTS LIKE WE HAVE TODAY
BethNoveck_2012G@87.65:103.44 IS THAT COMPANIES ARE VERY GOOD AT GETTING PEOPLE TO WORK TOGETHER IN TEAMS AND IN NETWORKS TO MAKE VERY COMPLEX PRODUCTS LIKE CARS AND COMPUTERS AND THE MORE COMPLEX THE PRODUCTS ARE A SOCIETY CREATES THE MORE SUCCESSFUL THE SOCIETY IS OVER TIME
BethNoveck_2012G@103.44:112.59 COMPANIES MAKE GOODS BUT GOVERNMENTS THEY MAKE PUBLIC GOODS THEY WORK ON THE CURE FOR CANCER AND EDUCATING OUR CHILDREN AND MAKING ROADS
BethNoveck_2012G@112.59:125.82 BUT WE DON 'T HAVE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY GOOD AT THIS KIND OF COMPLEXITY WE DON 'T HAVE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE GOOD AT BRINGING OUR TALENTS TO BEAR AT WORKING WITH US IN THIS KIND OF OPEN AND COLLABORATIVE WAY
BethNoveck_2012G@125.82:133.6 SO WHEN WE WANTED TO CREATE OUR OPEN GOVERNMENT POLICY WHAT DID WE DO WE WANTED NATURALLY TO ASK PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES HOW WE SHOULD OPEN UP GOVERNMENT
BethNoveck_2012G@133.6:136.81 TURNS OUT THAT HAD NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE
BethNoveck_2012G@136.81:147.58 WE WANTED TO ASK MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO HELP US COME UP WITH A POLICY NOT AFTER THE FACT COMMENTING ON A RULE AFTER IT 'S WRITTEN THE WAY IS TYPICALLY THE CASE BUT IN ADVANCE
BethNoveck_2012G@147.58:155.48 THERE WAS NO LEGAL PRECEDENT NO CULTURAL PRECEDENT NO TECHNICAL WAY OF DOING THIS IN FACT MANY PEOPLE TOLD US IT WAS ILLEGAL
BethNoveck_2012G@155.48:158.15 HERE 'S THE CRUX OF THE OBSTACLE
BethNoveck_2012G@158.15:168.16 GOVERNMENTS EXIST TO CHANNEL THE FLOW OF TWO THINGS REALLY VALUES AND EXPERTISE TO AND FROM GOVERNMENT AND TO AND FROM CITIZENS TO THE END OF MAKING DECISIONS
BethNoveck_2012G@168.16:177.32 BUT THE WAY THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE DESIGNED IN OUR RATHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CENTRALIZED MODEL IS TO CHANNEL THE FLOW OF VALUES THROUGH VOTING
BethNoveck_2012G@177.32:192.9 ONCE EVERY FOUR YEARS ONCE EVERY TWO YEARS AT BEST ONCE A YEAR THIS IS A RATHER ANEMIC AND THIN WAY IN THIS ERA OF SOCIAL MEDIA FOR US TO ACTUALLY EXPRESS OUR VALUES TODAY WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY THAT LETS US EXPRESS OURSELVES A GREAT DEAL PERHAPS A LITTLE TOO MUCH
BethNoveck_2012G@200.9:219.24 BUT WE 'VE CENTRALIZED THESE BUREAUCRACIES WE 'VE ENTRENCHED THEM AND WE KNOW THAT THE SMARTEST PERSON ALWAYS WORKS FOR SOMEONE ELSE WE NEED TO ONLY LOOK AROUND THIS ROOM TO KNOW THAT EXPERTISE AND INTELLIGENCE IS WIDELY DISTRIBUTED IN SOCIETY AND NOT LIMITED SIMPLY TO OUR INSTITUTIONS
BethNoveck_2012G@237.82:247.24 AND A LEAF IS DESIGNED TO CHANNEL THE FLOW OF NUTRIENTS TO THE TREE SOMETIMES EVEN HAVING TO ROUTE AROUND AN OBSTACLE BUT TO GET THAT NUTRITION FLOWING
BethNoveck_2012G@247.24:266.55 THE SAME CAN BE SAID FOR OUR SOCIAL SYSTEMS FOR OUR SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT WHERE AT THE VERY LEAST FLOW OFFERS US A HELPFUL METAPHOR FOR UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WHAT 'S REALLY BROKEN AND THE URGENT NEED THAT WE HAVE THAT WE ALL FEEL TODAY TO REDESIGN THE FLOW OF OUR INSTITUTIONS WE LIVE IN A CAMBRIAN ERA
BethNoveck_2012G@266.85:276.14 OF BIG DATA OF SOCIAL NETWORKS AND WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REDESIGN THESE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ACTUALLY QUITE RECENT
BethNoveck_2012G@276.14:284.24 THINK ABOUT IT WHAT OTHER BUSINESS DO YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY AND ESPECIALLY ONE AS BIG AS THE PUBLIC SECTOR
BethNoveck_2012G@284.24:301.74 THAT DOESN 'T SEEK TO REINVENT ITS BUSINESS MODEL ON A REGULAR BASIS SURE WE INVEST PLENTY IN INNOVATION WE INVEST IN BROADBAND AND SCIENCE EDUCATION AND SCIENCE GRANTS BUT WE INVEST FAR TOO LITTLE IN REINVENTING AND REDESIGNING THE INSTITUTIONS THAT WE HAVE
BethNoveck_2012G@301.74:312.7 NOW IT 'S VERY EASY TO COMPLAIN OF COURSE ABOUT PARTISAN POLITICS AND ENTRENCHED BUREAUCRACY AND WE LOVE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT GOVERNMENT IT 'S A PERENNIAL PASTIME ESPECIALLY AROUND ELECTION TIME
BethNoveck_2012G@312.7:330.25 BUT THE WORLD IS COMPLEX WE SOON WILL HAVE TEN BILLION PEOPLE MANY OF WHOM WILL LACK BASIC RESOURCES SO COMPLAIN AS WE MIGHT WHAT ACTUALLY CAN REPLACE WHAT WE HAVE TODAY WHAT COMES THE DAY AFTER THE ARAB SPRING WELL ONE
BethNoveck_2012G@347.77:355.67 TO FIGHT AGAINST LEGISLATIVE INCURSION AND THE CITIZENS OF THESE NETWORKS WORK TOGETHER TO SERVE EACH OTHER IN GREAT WAYS
BethNoveck_2012G@355.67:373.32 BUT PRIVATE COMMUNITIES PRIVATE CORPORATE PRIVATIZING COMMUNITIES ARE NOT BOTTOM UP DEMOCRACIES THEY CANNOT REPLACE GOVERNMENT FRIENDING SOMEONE ON FACEBOOK IS NOT COMPLEX ENOUGH TO DO THE HARD WORK OF YOU AND I COLLABORATING WITH EACH OTHER AND DOING THE HARD WORK OF GOVERNANCE
BethNoveck_2012G@373.32:376.18 BUT SOCIAL MEDIA DO TEACH US SOMETHING
BethNoveck_2012G@376.18:395.48 WHY IS TWITTER SO SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IT OPENS UP ITS PLATFORM IT OPENS UP THE API TO ALLOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW APPLICATIONS TO BE BUILT ON TOP OF IT SO THAT WE CAN READ AND PROCESS INFORMATION IN NEW AND EXCITING WAYS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO OPEN UP THE API OF GOVERNMENT
BethNoveck_2012G@395.48:404.24 AND THE WAY THAT WE 'RE GOING TO DO THAT THE NEXT GREAT SUPERPOWER IS GOING TO BE THE ONE WHO CAN SUCCESSFULLY COMBINE
BethNoveck_2012G@404.24:424.24 THE HIERARCHY OF INSTITUTION BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN THOSE PUBLIC VALUES WE HAVE TO COORDINATE THE FLOW BUT WITH THE DIVERSITY AND THE PULSATING LIFE AND THE CHAOS AND THE EXCITEMENT OF NETWORKS ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER TO BUILD THESE NEW INNOVATIONS ON TOP OF OUR INSTITUTIONS TO ENGAGE IN THE PRACTICE OF GOVERNANCE
BethNoveck_2012G@424.24:430.98 WE HAVE A PRECEDENT FOR THIS GOOD OLD HENRY II HERE IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY INVENTED THE JURY
BethNoveck_2012G@430.98:437.98 POWERFUL PRACTICAL PALPABLE MODEL FOR HANDING POWER FROM GOVERNMENT TO CITIZENS
BethNoveck_2012G@437.98:442.76 TODAY WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND WE HAVE THE IMPERATIVE
BethNoveck_2012G@442.76:459.7 TO CREATE THOUSANDS OF NEW WAYS OF INTERCONNECTING BETWEEN NETWORKS AND INSTITUTIONS THOUSANDS OF NEW KINDS OF JURIES THE CITIZEN JURY THE CARROTMOB THE HACKATHON WE ARE JUST BEGINNING TO INVENT THE MODELS BY WHICH WE CAN COCREATE THE PROCESS OF GOVERNANCE
BethNoveck_2012G@471.56:475.26 SOME OF IT 'S VERY HIGH TECH AND SOME OF IT IS EXTREMELY LOW TECH
BethNoveck_2012G@475.26:479.33 SUCH AS THE PROJECT THAT MKSS IS RUNNING IN RAJASTHAN INDIA
BethNoveck_2012G@479.33:498.8 WHERE THEY TAKE THE SPENDING DATA OF THE STATE AND PAINT IT ON ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND VILLAGE WALLS AND THEN INVITE THE VILLAGERS TO COME AND COMMENT WHO IS ON THE GOVERNMENT PAYROLL WHO 'S ACTUALLY DIED WHAT ARE THE BRIDGES THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT TO NOWHERE AND TO WORK TOGETHER THROUGH CIVIC ENGAGEMENT TO SAVE REAL MONEY AND PARTICIPATE AND HAVE ACCESS TO THAT BUDGET
BethNoveck_2012G@498.8:514.81 BUT IT 'S NOT JUST ABOUT POLICING GOVERNMENT IT 'S ALSO ABOUT CREATING GOVERNMENT SPACEHIVE IN THE U K IS ENGAGING IN CROWD FUNDING GETTING YOU AND ME TO RAISE THE MONEY TO BUILD THE GOALPOSTS AND THE PARK BENCHES THAT WILL ACTUALLY ALLOW US TO DELIVER BETTER SERVICES IN OUR COMMUNITIES
BethNoveck_2012G@524.96:544.22 CREATED AFTER THE POST ELECTION RIOTS IN KENYA IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THIS CRISIS MAPPING WEBSITE AND COMMUNITY IS ACTUALLY ABLE TO CROWDSOURCE AND TARGET THE DELIVERY OF BETTER RESCUE SERVICES TO PEOPLE TRAPPED UNDER THE RUBBLE WHETHER IT 'S AFTER THE EARTHQUAKES IN HAITI OR MORE RECENTLY IN ITALY
BethNoveck_2012G@544.22:554.13 AND THE RED CROSS TOO IS TRAINING VOLUNTEERS AND TWITTER IS CERTIFYING THEM NOT SIMPLY TO SUPPLEMENT EXISTING GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS BUT IN MANY CASES TO REPLACE THEM
BethNoveck_2012G@568.71:581.08 THERE 'S SO MANY EXAMPLES I COULD HAVE PICKED AND I SELECTED THIS ONE OF JON BON JOVI SOME OF YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW THAT HE RUNS A SOUP KITCHEN IN NEW JERSEY WHERE HE CATERS TO AND SERVES THE HOMELESS AND PARTICULARLY HOMELESS VETERANS
BethNoveck_2012G@581.08:598.21 IN FEBRUARY HE APPROACHED THE WHITE HOUSE AND SAID I WOULD LIKE TO FUND A PRIZE TO CREATE SCALABLE NATIONAL APPLICATIONS APPS THAT WILL HELP NOT ONLY THE HOMELESS BUT THOSE WHO DELIVER SERVICES TO THEM TO DO SO BETTER FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE TO JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE
BethNoveck_2012G@598.21:613.51 THE FINALISTS ARE ANNOUNCED IN THE COMPETITION CAN YOU IMAGINE IN THE BUREAUCRATIC WORLD OF YESTERYEAR GETTING ANYTHING DONE IN A FOUR MONTH PERIOD OF TIME YOU CAN BARELY FILL OUT THE FORMS IN THAT AMOUNT OF TIME LET ALONE GENERATE REAL PALPABLE INNOVATIONS THAT IMPROVE PEOPLE 'S LIVES
BethNoveck_2012G@613.51:620.64 AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR TO MENTION THAT THIS OPEN GOVERNMENT REVOLUTION IS NOT ABOUT PRIVATIZING GOVERNMENT
BethNoveck_2012G@620.64:636.05 BECAUSE IN MANY CASES WHAT IT CAN DO WHEN WE HAVE THE WILL TO DO SO IS TO DELIVER MORE PROGRESSIVE AND BETTER POLICY THAN THE REGULATIONS AND THE LEGISLATIVE AND LITIGATION ORIENTED STRATEGIES BY WHICH WE MAKE POLICY TODAY
BethNoveck_2012G@662.89:676.26 BUT TO REPLACE THOSE REGULATIONS WITH MORE INNOVATIVE ALTERNATIVES SOMETIMES USING TRANSPARENCY IN THE CREATION OF NEW IPHONE APPS THAT WILL ALLOWS US BOTH TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND THE PUBLIC AND TO ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
BethNoveck_2012G@676.26:690.04 THAT IS A NICE SIDELINE OF OPEN GOVERNMENT IT 'S NOT ONLY THE BENEFITS THAT WE 'VE TALKED ABOUT WITH REGARD TO DEVELOPMENT IT 'S THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND THE JOB CREATION THAT 'S COMING FROM THIS OPEN INNOVATION WORK
BethNoveck_2012G@701.23:713.11 LAST YEAR THEY SAVED A BILLION DOLLARS THIRTY BILLION RUBLES FROM OPEN INNOVATION AND THEY 'RE PUSHING RADICALLY THE EXTENSION OF CROWDSOURCING NOT ONLY FROM BANKING BUT INTO THE PUBLIC SECTOR
BethNoveck_2012G@713.11:722.9 AND WE SEE LOTS OF EXAMPLES OF THESE INNOVATORS USING OPEN GOVERNMENT DATA NOT SIMPLY TO MAKE APPS BUT THEN TO MAKE COMPANIES AND TO HIRE PEOPLE TO BUILD THEM WORKING WITH THE GOVERNMENT
BethNoveck_2012G@722.9:728.48 SO A LOT OF THESE INNOVATIONS ARE LOCAL IN SAN RAMON CALIFORNIA THEY PUBLISHED AN IPHONE APP
BethNoveck_2012G@728.48:746.49 IN WHICH THEY ALLOW YOU OR ME TO SAY WE ARE CERTIFIED CPR TRAINED AND THEN WHEN SOMEONE HAS A HEART ATTACK A NOTIFICATION GOES OUT SO THAT YOU CAN RUSH OVER TO THE PERSON OVER HERE AND DELIVER CPR THE VICTIM WHO RECEIVES BYSTANDER CPR IS MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY TO SURVIVE
BethNoveck_2012G@746.49:749.9 THERE IS A HERO IN ALL OF US IS THEIR SLOGAN
BethNoveck_2012G@749.9:759.63 BUT IT 'S NOT LIMITED TO THE LOCAL BRITISH COLUMBIA CANADA IS PUBLISHING A CATALOGUE OF ALL THE WAYS THAT ITS RESIDENTS AND CITIZENS CAN ENGAGE WITH THE STATE
BethNoveck_2012G@762.18:771.11 LET ME BE VERY CLEAR AND PERHAPS CONTROVERSIAL THAT OPEN GOVERNMENT IS NOT ABOUT TRANSPARENT GOVERNMENT
BethNoveck_2012G@771.11:790.67 SIMPLY THROWING DATA OVER THE TRANSOM DOESN 'T CHANGE HOW GOVERNMENT WORKS IT DOESN 'T GET ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING WITH THAT DATA TO CHANGE LIVES TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND IT DOESN 'T CHANGE GOVERNMENT WHAT IT DOES IS IT CREATES AN ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CIVIL SOCIETY AND GOVERNMENT OVER THE CONTROL AND OWNERSHIP OF INFORMATION
BethNoveck_2012G@790.67:806.23 AND TRANSPARENCY BY ITSELF IS NOT REDUCING THE FLOW OF MONEY INTO POLITICS AND ARGUABLY IT 'S NOT EVEN PRODUCING ACCOUNTABILITY AS WELL AS IT MIGHT IF WE TOOK THE NEXT STEP OF COMBINING PARTICIPATION AND COLLABORATION WITH TRANSPARENCY TO TRANSFORM HOW WE WORK
BethNoveck_2012G@817.32:834.77 STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AND THIS IS HOW THIS OPEN GOVERNMENT WORK IN THE U S REALLY GOT STARTED I WAS TEACHING A PATENT LAW CLASS TO MY STUDENTS AND EXPLAINING TO THEM HOW A SINGLE PERSON IN THE BUREAUCRACY HAS THE POWER TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHICH PATENT APPLICATION BECOMES THE NEXT PATENT
BethNoveck_2012G@834.77:840.54 AND THEREFORE MONOPOLIZES FOR TWENTY YEARS THE RIGHTS OVER AN ENTIRE FIELD OF INVENTIVE ACTIVITY
BethNoveck_2012G@840.54:848.63 WELL WHAT DID WE DO WE SAID WE CAN MAKE A WEBSITE WE CAN MAKE AN EXPERT NETWORK A SOCIAL NETWORK THAT WOULD CONNECT THE NETWORK TO THE INSTITUTION
BethNoveck_2012G@848.63:859.83 TO ALLOW SCIENTISTS AND TECHNOLOGISTS TO GET BETTER INFORMATION TO THE PATENT OFFICE TO AID IN MAKING THOSE DECISIONS WE PILOTED THE WORK IN THE U S AND THE U K AND JAPAN AND AUSTRALIA
BethNoveck_2012G@859.83:874.2 AND NOW I 'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THE UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE WILL BE ROLLING OUT UNIVERSAL COMPLETE AND TOTAL OPENNESS SO THAT ALL PATENT APPLICATIONS WILL NOW BE OPEN FOR CITIZEN PARTICIPATION BEGINNING THIS YEAR
BethNoveck_2012G@874.2:876.99 THE SECOND PHASE OF THIS EVOLUTION YEAH
BethNoveck_2012G@880.87:886.95 FIRST PHASE IS IN GETTING BETTER INFORMATION IN THE SECOND PHASE IS IN GETTING DECISION MAKING POWER OUT
BethNoveck_2012G@886.95:902.5 PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING HAS LONG BEEN PRACTICED IN PORTO ALEGRE BRAZIL THEY 'RE JUST STARTING IT IN THE FORTY NINTH WARD IN CHICAGO RUSSIA IS USING WIKIS TO GET CITIZENS WRITING LAW TOGETHER AS IS LITHUANIA WHEN WE START TO SEE POWER OVER THE CORE FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT
BethNoveck_2012G@902.5:909.76 SPENDING LEGISLATION DECISION MAKING THEN WE 'RE WELL ON OUR WAY TO AN OPEN GOVERNMENT REVOLUTION
BethNoveck_2012G@909.76:913.27 THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO GET US THERE
BethNoveck_2012G@913.27:931.79 OBVIOUSLY OPENING UP THE DATA IS ONE BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO CREATE LOTS MORE CREATE AND CURATE LOTS MORE PARTICIPATORY OPPORTUNITIES HACKATHONS AND MASHATHONS AND WORKING WITH DATA TO BUILD APPS IS AN INTELLIGIBLE WAY FOR PEOPLE TO ENGAGE AND PARTICIPATE LIKE THE JURY IS
BethNoveck_2012G@931.79:934.97 BUT WE 'RE GOING TO NEED LOTS MORE THINGS LIKE IT
BethNoveck_2012G@934.97:939.3 AND THAT 'S WHY WE NEED TO START WITH OUR YOUNGEST PEOPLE
BethNoveck_2012G@939.3:952.36 WE 'VE HEARD TALK HERE AT TED ABOUT PEOPLE BIOHACKING AND HACKING THEIR PLANTS WITH ARDUINO AND MOZILLA IS DOING WORK AROUND THE WORLD IN GETTING YOUNG PEOPLE TO BUILD WEBSITES AND MAKE VIDEOS
BethNoveck_2012G@952.36:970.42 WHEN WE START BY TEACHING YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE LIVE NOT IN A PASSIVE SOCIETY A READ ONLY SOCIETY BUT IN A WRITABLE SOCIETY WHERE WE HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE OUR COMMUNITIES TO CHANGE OUR INSTITUTIONS THAT 'S WHEN WE BEGIN TO REALLY PUT OURSELVES ON THE PATHWAY TOWARDS THIS OPEN GOVERNMENT
BethNoveck_2012G@970.42:975.2 INNOVATION TOWARDS THIS OPEN GOVERNMENT MOVEMENT TOWARDS THIS OPEN GOVERNMENT REVOLUTION
BethNoveck_2012G@975.2:993.8 SO LET ME CLOSE BY SAYING THAT I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING FOR US TO DO IS TO TALK ABOUT AND DEMAND THIS REVOLUTION WE DON 'T HAVE WORDS REALLY TO DESCRIBE IT YET WORDS LIKE EQUALITY AND FAIRNESS AND THE TRADITIONAL ELECTIONS DEMOCRACY THESE ARE NOT REALLY GREAT TERMS YET
BethNoveck_2012G@1000.91:1010.84 BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT IF WE WANT TO SEE THE KINDS OF INNOVATIONS THE HOPEFUL AND EXCITING INNOVATIONS THAT WE HEAR TALKED ABOUT HERE AT TED IN CLEAN ENERGY IN CLEAN EDUCATION
BethNoveck_2012G@1010.84:1027.28 IN DEVELOPMENT IF WE WANT TO SEE THOSE ADOPTED AND WE WANT TO SEE THOSE SCALED WE WANT TO SEE THEM BECOME THE GOVERNANCE OF TOMORROW THEN WE MUST ALL PARTICIPATE THEN WE MUST GET INVOLVED WE MUST OPEN UP OUR INSTITUTIONS AND LIKE THE LEAF WE MUST LET THE NUTRIENTS FLOW
