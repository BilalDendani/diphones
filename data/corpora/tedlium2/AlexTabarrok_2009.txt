AlexTabarrok_2009@22.64:24.16 THE FIRST WORLD WAR
AlexTabarrok_2009@24.62:30.63 THE GREAT DEPRESSION THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND THE RISE OF THE COMMUNIST NATIONS
AlexTabarrok_2009@31.30:40.29 AND EACH ONE OF THESE FORCES SPLIT THE WORLD TORE THE WORLD APART DIVIDED THE WORLD AND THEY THREW UP WALLS
AlexTabarrok_2009@40.85:48.98 POLITICAL WALLS TRADE WALLS TRANSPORTATION WALLS COMMUNICATION WALLS IRON CURTAINS WHICH DIVIDED PEOPLES
AlexTabarrok_2009@49.31:61.16 AND NATIONS IT WAS ONLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THAT WE SLOWLY BEGAN TO PULL OURSELVES OUT OF THIS ABYSS
AlexTabarrok_2009@62.39:71.60 TRADE WALLS BEGAN TO COME TUMBLING DOWN HERE ARE SOME DATA ON TARIFFS STARTING AT FORTY PERCENT COMING DOWN TO LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT WE GLOBALIZED THE WORLD
AlexTabarrok_2009@72.07:79.43 THAT MEAN IT MEANS THAT WE EXTENDED COOPERATION ACROSS NATIONAL BOUNDARIES WE MADE THE WORLD MORE
AlexTabarrok_2009@91.90:100.25 TODAY A CONTAINER SHIP CAN CARRY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TONS IT CAN BE MANNED WITH A SMALLER CREW AND UNLOADED FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE
AlexTabarrok_2009@101.86:107.36 I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THE INTERNET HAVE COME TUMBLING DOWN AND OF COURSE THE IRON CURTAINS
AlexTabarrok_2009@109.63:110.94 HAVE COME TUMBLING DOWN
AlexTabarrok_2009@111.82:115.07 NOW ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS FOR THE WORLD
AlexTabarrok_2009@127.64:136.01 AND PERHAPS MOST REMARKABLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY REALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MODERN HISTORY
AlexTabarrok_2009@136.57:140.64 GROWTH EXTENDED TO ALMOST ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD
AlexTabarrok_2009@152.21:153.59 NEVER BEFORE
AlexTabarrok_2009@154.20:155.51 IN HUMAN HISTORY
AlexTabarrok_2009@155.84:165.01 HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE BEEN RAISED OUT OF SUCH GREAT POVERTY AS HAPPENED IN CHINA CHINA IS THE WORLD 'S GREATEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES
AlexTabarrok_2009@185.87:197.49 AFRICA HAS BEEN THE AREA OF THE WORLD MOST RESISTANT TO GROWTH AND WE CAN SEE THE TRAGEDY OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST FEW BARS HERE GROWTH WAS NEGATIVE
AlexTabarrok_2009@208.89:216.42 WE SAW GROWTH IN AFRICA AND I THINK AS YOU'LL SEE THERE'S REASONS FOR OPTIMISM BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE BEST IS YET TO COME
AlexTabarrok_2009@217.25:229.95 NOW WHY ON THE CUTTING EDGE TODAY IT'S NEW IDEAS WHICH ARE DRIVING GROWTH AND BY THAT I MEAN IT'S PRODUCTS FOR WHICH THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE REALLY HIGH AND THE MANUFACTURING COSTS ARE LOW
AlexTabarrok_2009@230.24:237.71 MORE THAN EVER BEFORE IT IS THESE TYPES OF IDEAS WHICH ARE DRIVING GROWTH ON THE CUTTING EDGE NOW IDEAS HAVE THIS AMAZING PROPERTY
AlexTabarrok_2009@248.89:253.91 AS HE WHO LIGHTS HIS CANDLE AT MINE RECEIVES LIGHT WITHOUT DARKENING ME
AlexTabarrok_2009@254.85:260.96 OR TO PUT IT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY ONE APPLE FEEDS ONE MAN BUT AN IDEA CAN FEED THE WORLD
AlexTabarrok_2009@261.38:270.87 NOW THIS IS NOT NEW THIS IS PRACTICALLY NOT NEW TO TEDSTERS THIS IS PRACTICALLY THE MODEL OF TED WHAT IS NEW IS THAT THE GREATER FUNCTION OF IDEAS
AlexTabarrok_2009@271.21:273.08 IS GOING TO DRIVE GROWTH
AlexTabarrok_2009@274.58:287.59 EVEN MORE THAN EVER BEFORE THIS PROVIDES A REASON WHY TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION ARE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER BEFORE AND ARE GOING TO INCREASE GROWTH MORE THAN EVER BEFORE AND TO EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS SO I HAVE A QUESTION
AlexTabarrok_2009@289.13:296.16 SUPPOSE THAT THERE ARE TWO DISEASES ONE OF THEM IS RARE THE OTHER ONE IS COMMON BUT IF THEY ARE NOT TREATED THEY ARE EQUALLY SEVERE
AlexTabarrok_2009@296.72:302.16 IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE WHICH WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE THE COMMON DISEASE OR THE RARE DISEASE
AlexTabarrok_2009@303.75:314.18 COMMON THE COMMON I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WHY BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE DRUGS TO TREAT COMMON DISEASES THAN THERE ARE TO TREAT RARE DISEASES THE REASON FOR THIS IS INCENTIVES
AlexTabarrok_2009@314.59:324.73 IT COSTS ABOUT THE SAME TO PRODUCE A NEW DRUG WHETHER THAT DRUG TREATS ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE OR A MILLION PEOPLE BUT THE REVENUES ARE MUCH GREATER
AlexTabarrok_2009@324.83:330.71 IF THE DRUG TREATS A MILLION PEOPLE SO THE INCENTIVES ARE MUCH LARGER TO PRODUCE DRUGS
AlexTabarrok_2009@331.34:337.18 WHICH TREAT MORE PEOPLE TO PUT THIS DIFFERENTLY LARGER MARKETS SAVE LIVES
AlexTabarrok_2009@342.69:352.07 THINK ABOUT THE FOLLOWING IF CHINA AND INDIA WERE AS RICH AS THE UNITED STATES IS TODAY THE MARKET FOR CANCER DRUGS WOULD BE EIGHT TIMES LARGER THAN IT IS NOW
AlexTabarrok_2009@353.16:355.64 NOW WE ARE NOT THERE YET BUT IT IS HAPPENING
AlexTabarrok_2009@356.23:368.17 AS OTHER COUNTRIES BECOME RICHER THE DEMAND FOR THESE PHARMACEUTICALS IS GOING TO INCREASE TREMENDOUSLY AND THAT MEANS AN INCREASE INCENTIVE TO DO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WHICH BENEFITS EVERYONE IN THE WORLD
AlexTabarrok_2009@380.07:392.40 ACTION MOVIES HAVE LARGER BUDGETS THAN COMEDIES IT'S BECAUSE ACTION MOVIES TRANSLATE EASIER INTO OTHER LANGUAGES AND OTHER CULTURES SO THE MARKET FOR THOSE MOVIES IS LARGER PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO INVEST MORE AND THE BUDGETS ARE LARGER
AlexTabarrok_2009@393.35:400.95 ALRIGHT WELL IF LARGER MARKETS INCREASE THE INCENTIVE TO PRODUCE NEW IDEAS HOW DO WE MAXIMIZE THAT INCENTIVE
AlexTabarrok_2009@402.32:416.01 HAVING ONE WORLD MARKET BY GLOBALIZING THE WORLD THE WAY I LIKE TO PUT THIS IS ONE IDEA IDEAS ARE MEANT TO BE SHARED SO ONE IDEA CAN SERVE ONE WORLD ONE MARKET
AlexTabarrok_2009@416.63:419.16 ONE IDEA ONE WORLD ONE MARKET
AlexTabarrok_2009@421.77:423.92 CAN WE CREATE NEW IDEAS THAT'S ONE REASON
AlexTabarrok_2009@425.45:429.79 TRADE HOW ELSE CAN WE CREATE NEW IDEAS WELL MORE IDEA CREATORS
AlexTabarrok_2009@430.66:441.80 IDEA CREATORS THEY COME FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE ARTISTS AND INNOVATORS MANY OF THE PEOPLE YOU'VE SEEN ON THIS STAGE I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS BECAUSE I HAVE SOME DATA ON THAT AND I'M A DATA PERSON
AlexTabarrok_2009@442.76:445.58 NOW TODAY LESS THAN ONE
AlexTabarrok_2009@446.43:451.52 OF ONE PERCENT OF THE WORLD 'S POPULATION ARE SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS
AlexTabarrok_2009@459.95:467.87 THE U S IS LOSING ITS IDEA LEADERSHIP AND FOR THAT I AM VERY GRATEFUL THAT IS A GOOD THING
AlexTabarrok_2009@468.30:479.52 IT IS FORTUNATE THAT WE ARE BECOMING LESS OF AN IDEA LEADER BECAUSE FOR TOO LONG THE UNITED STATES AND A HANDFUL OF OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES HAVE SHOULDERED THE ENTIRE BURDEN OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AlexTabarrok_2009@480.20:490.50 BUT CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING IF THE WORLD AS A WHOLE WERE AS WEALTHY AS THE UNITED STATES IS NOW THERE WOULD BE MORE THAN FIVE TIMES AS MANY SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS CONTRIBUTING
AlexTabarrok_2009@491.24:498.58 IDEAS WHICH BENEFIT EVERYONE WHICH ARE SHARED BY EVERYONE I THINK OF THE GREAT INDIAN MATHEMATICIAN
AlexTabarrok_2009@499.36:509.32 HOW MANY RAMANUJANS ARE THERE IN INDIA TODAY TOILING IN THE FIELDS BARELY ABLE TO FEED THEMSELVES WHEN THEY COULD BE FEEDING THE WORLD
AlexTabarrok_2009@510.63:519.03 NOW WE'RE NOT THERE YET BUT IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS CENTURY THE REAL TRAGEDY OF THE LAST CENTURY
AlexTabarrok_2009@519.86:533.21 IS THIS IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE WORLD 'S POPULATION AS A GIANT COMPUTER A MASSIVELY PARALLEL PROCESSOR THEN THE GREAT TRAGEDY HAS BEEN THAT BILLIONS OF OUR PROCESSORS HAVE BEEN OFF
AlexTabarrok_2009@534.47:539.74 BUT IN THIS CENTURY CHINA IS COMING ON LINE INDIA IS COMING ON LINE
AlexTabarrok_2009@540.66:545.20 IS COMING ON LINE WE WILL SEE AN EINSTEIN IN AFRICA IN THIS CENTURY
AlexTabarrok_2009@557.90:563.60 THINK WHAT THIS MEANS THIS MEANS WE ALL BENEFIT WHEN ANOTHER COUNTRY GETS RICH
AlexTabarrok_2009@573.93:580.38 NEED A GREATER DEMAND FOR IDEAS THOSE LARGER MARKETS I WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER AND A GREATER SUPPLY
AlexTabarrok_2009@580.81:582.28 OF IDEAS FOR THE WORLD
AlexTabarrok_2009@582.83:585.46 NOW YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE REASONS WHY I'M OPTIMISTIC
AlexTabarrok_2009@612.11:615.42 CENTURY THAN YOU EXPECT TO SEE IN A YEAR TODAY
AlexTabarrok_2009@628.03:640.05 AVERAGE GDP PER CAPITA IN THE WORLD WILL BE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S NOT U S GDP PER CAPITA WHICH WILL BE OVER A MILLION BUT WORLD GDP PER CAPITA TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S NOT THAT FAR
AlexTabarrok_2009@641.38:652.35 WE WON 'T MAKE IT BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WILL AND I SHOULD SAY I THINK THIS IS A RATHER MODEST PREDICTION IN KURZWEILIAN TERMS THIS IS GLOOMY
AlexTabarrok_2009@657.57:658.27 GROWTH
AlexTabarrok_2009@661.74:665.98 ALRIGHT WHAT ABOUT PROBLEMS WHAT ABOUT A GREAT DEPRESSION
AlexTabarrok_2009@666.68:669.56 WELL LET 'S TAKE A LOOK LET 'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE GREAT DEPRESSION
AlexTabarrok_2009@708.48:711.30 WE WENT OFF A CLIFF BUT WE RECOVERED
AlexTabarrok_2009@712.35:719.27 IN FACT IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY GROWTH WAS EVEN HIGHER THAN ANYTHING YOU WOULD HAVE PREDICTED
AlexTabarrok_2009@720.15:727.81 UPON THE FIRST HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY SO GROWTH CAN WASH AWAY EVEN WHAT APPEARS TO BE A GREAT DEPRESSION
AlexTabarrok_2009@728.61:733.43 ALRIGHT WHAT ELSE OIL OIL THIS WAS A BIG TOPIC WHEN I WAS
AlexTabarrok_2009@734.77:745.01 WRITING UP MY NOTES OIL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS PER BARREL SO PEOPLE WERE ASKING A QUESTION THE WERE SAYING IS CHINA DRINKING OUR MILKSHAKE
AlexTabarrok_2009@747.85:754.30 AND THERE IS SOME TRUTH TO THIS IN THE SENSE THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING OF A FINITE RESOURCE AND
AlexTabarrok_2009@764.82:771.95 MOREOVER AS EVERYONE KNOWS LOOK IT'S ENERGY NOT OIL WHICH COUNTS AND HIGHER OIL
AlexTabarrok_2009@782.61:791.20 TO OVERCOME AN INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF OIL TODAY THAN EVER IN THE PAST BECAUSE OF WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT ONE IDEA ONE WORLD ONE MARKET
AlexTabarrok_2009@792.93:794.09 SO I'M OPTIMISTIC
AlexTabarrok_2009@795.38:805.26 SO LONG AS WE HEW TO THESE TWO IDEAS TO KEEP GLOBALIZING WORLD MARKETS KEEP EXTENDING COOPERATION ACROSS NATIONAL BOUNDARIES AND KEEP INVESTING IN EDUCATION
AlexTabarrok_2009@806.36:815.26 NOW THE UNITED STATES HAS A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN THIS TO KEEP OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM GLOBALIZED
AlexTabarrok_2009@815.41:823.15 TO KEEP OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM OPEN TO STUDENTS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD BECAUSE OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM IS THE CANDLE
AlexTabarrok_2009@823.67:831.05 THAT OTHER STUDENTS COME TO TO LIGHT THEIR OWN CANDLES NOW REMEMBER HERE WHAT JEFFERSON SAID
AlexTabarrok_2009@831.85:841.03 JEFFERSON SAID WHEN THEY COME AND LIGHT THEIR CANDLES AT OURS THAT THEY GAIN LIGHT AND WE ARE NOT DARKENED
AlexTabarrok_2009@845.78:847.14 BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS
AlexTabarrok_2009@856.58:857.28 SO
AlexTabarrok_2009@858.65:862.93 MY VIEW IS BE OPTIMISTIC SPREAD THE IDEAS SPREAD THE LIGHT
AlexTabarrok_2009@863.41:864.53 THANK YOU
