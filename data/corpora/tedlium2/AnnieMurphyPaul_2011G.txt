AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@16.4:26.17 SUBJECT TODAY IS LEARNING AND IN THAT SPIRIT I WANT TO SPRING ON YOU ALL A POP QUIZ READY WHEN DOES LEARNING BEGIN
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@26.17:40.54 NOW AS YOU PONDER THAT QUESTION MAYBE YOU 'RE THINKING ABOUT THE FIRST DAY OF PRESCHOOL OR KINDERGARTEN THE FIRST TIME THAT KIDS ARE IN A CLASSROOM WITH A TEACHER OR MAYBE YOU 'VE CALLED TO MIND THE TODDLER PHASE WHEN CHILDREN ARE LEARNING HOW TO WALK
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@40.56:46.29 AND TALK AND USE A FORK MAYBE YOU 'VE ENCOUNTERED THE ZERO TO THREE MOVEMENT
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@46.5:61.37 WHICH ASSERTS THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT YEARS FOR LEARNING ARE THE EARLIEST ONES AND SO YOUR ANSWER TO MY QUESTION WOULD BE LEARNING BEGINS AT BIRTH WELL TODAY I WANT TO PRESENT TO YOU AN IDEA THAT MAY BE SURPRISING
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@64.27:75.06 BUT WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY THE LATEST EVIDENCE FROM PSYCHOLOGY AND BIOLOGY AND THAT IS THAT SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LEARNING WE EVER DO HAPPENS BEFORE WE 'RE BORN
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@84.04:89.34 AND THOSE TWO ROLES CAME TOGETHER FOR ME IN A BOOK THAT I WROTE CALLED ORIGINS
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@89.35:108.77 ORIGINS IS A REPORT FROM THE FRONT LINES OF AN EXCITING NEW FIELD CALLED FETAL ORIGINS FETAL ORIGINS IS A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE THAT EMERGED JUST ABOUT TWO DECADES AGO AND IT 'S BASED ON THE THEORY THAT OUR HEALTH AND WELL BEING THROUGHOUT OUR LIVES
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@113.19:122.2 NOW THIS THEORY WAS OF MORE THAN JUST INTELLECTUAL INTEREST TO ME I WAS MYSELF PREGNANT WHILE I WAS DOING THE RESEARCH FOR THE BOOK
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@122.2:139.78 AND ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING INSIGHTS I TOOK FROM THIS WORK IS THAT WE 'RE ALL LEARNING ABOUT THE WORLD EVEN BEFORE WE ENTER IT WHEN WE HOLD OUR BABIES FOR THE FIRST TIME WE MIGHT IMAGINE THAT THEY 'RE CLEAN SLATES UNMARKED BY LIFE
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@139.78:155.77 WHEN IN FACT THEY 'VE ALREADY BEEN SHAPED BY US AND BY THE PARTICULAR WORLD WE LIVE IN TODAY I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE AMAZING THINGS THAT SCIENTISTS ARE DISCOVERING ABOUT WHAT FETUSES LEARN WHILE THEY 'RE STILL IN THEIR MOTHERS BELLIES
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@155.77:161.42 FIRST OF ALL THEY LEARN THE SOUND OF THEIR MOTHERS VOICES
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@161.42:178.5 BECAUSE SOUNDS FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD HAVE TO TRAVEL THROUGH THE MOTHER 'S ABDOMINAL TISSUE AND THROUGH THE AMNIOTIC FLUID THAT SURROUNDS THE FETUS THE VOICES FETUSES HEAR STARTING AROUND THE FOURTH MONTH OF GESTATION ARE MUTED AND MUFFLED
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@178.76:185.55 ONE RESEARCHER SAYS THAT THEY PROBABLY SOUND A LOT LIKE THE THE VOICE OF CHARLIE BROWN 'S TEACHER IN THE OLD PEANUTS CARTOON
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@185.96:191.61 BUT THE PREGNANT WOMAN 'S OWN VOICE REVERBERATES THROUGH HER BODY
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@191.67:194.39 REACHING THE FETUS MUCH MORE READILY
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@194.49:199.37 AND BECAUSE THE FETUS IS WITH HER ALL THE TIME IT HEARS HER VOICE
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@214.63:232.35 RESEARCHERS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS FACT BY RIGGING UP TWO RUBBER NIPPLES SO THAT IF A BABY SUCKS ON ONE IT HEARS A RECORDING OF ITS MOTHER 'S VOICE ON A PAIR OF HEADPHONES AND IF IT SUCKS ON THE OTHER NIPPLE IT HEARS A RECORDING OF A FEMALE STRANGER 'S VOICE
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@232.35:237.7 BABIES QUICKLY SHOW THEIR PREFERENCE BY CHOOSING THE FIRST ONE
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@237.7:249.95 SCIENTISTS ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT BABIES WILL SLOW DOWN THEIR SUCKING WHEN SOMETHING INTERESTS THEM AND RESUME THEIR FAST SUCKING WHEN THEY GET BORED
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@249.95:265.61 THIS IS HOW RESEARCHERS DISCOVERED THAT AFTER WOMEN REPEATEDLY READ ALOUD A SECTION OF DR SEUSS THE CAT IN THE HAT WHILE THEY WERE PREGNANT THEIR NEWBORN BABIES RECOGNIZED THAT PASSAGE WHEN THEY HEAR IT OUTSIDE THE WOMB
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@281.13:299.01 SO FETUSES ARE EVEN LEARNING ABOUT THE PARTICULAR LANGUAGE THAT 'S SPOKEN IN THE WORLD THAT THEY 'LL BE BORN INTO A STUDY PUBLISHED LAST YEAR FOUND THAT FROM BIRTH FROM THE MOMENT OF BIRTH BABIES CRY IN THE ACCENT OF THEIR MOTHER 'S NATIVE LANGUAGE
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@313.73:324.61 IT MAY HAVE EVOLVED TO AID THE BABY 'S SURVIVAL FROM THE MOMENT OF BIRTH THE BABY RESPONDS MOST TO THE VOICE OF THE PERSON WHO IS MOST LIKELY TO CARE FOR IT ITS MOTHER
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@324.86:340.33 IT EVEN MAKES ITS CRIES SOUND LIKE THE MOTHER 'S LANGUAGE WHICH MAY FURTHER ENDEAR THE BABY TO THE MOTHER AND WHICH MAY GIVE THE BABY A HEAD START IN THE CRITICAL TASK OF LEARNING HOW TO UNDERSTAND AND SPEAK ITS NATIVE LANGUAGE
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@340.33:347.55 BUT IT 'S NOT JUST SOUNDS THAT FETUSES ARE LEARNING ABOUT IN UTERO IT 'S ALSO TASTES AND SMELLS
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@347.55:365.09 BY SEVEN MONTHS OF GESTATION THE FETUS TASTE BUDS ARE FULLY DEVELOPED AND ITS OLFACTORY RECEPTORS WHICH ALLOW IT TO SMELL ARE FUNCTIONING THE FLAVORS OF THE FOOD A PREGNANT WOMAN EATS FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE AMNIOTIC FLUID WHICH IS CONTINUOUSLY SWALLOWED BY THE FETUS
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@365.09:371.53 BABIES SEEM TO REMEMBER AND PREFER THESE TASTES ONCE THEY 'RE OUT IN THE WORLD
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@371.53:386.02 IN ONE EXPERIMENT A GROUP OF PREGNANT WOMEN WAS ASKED TO DRINK A LOT OF CARROT JUICE DURING THEIR THIRD TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY WHILE ANOTHER GROUP OF PREGNANT WOMEN DRANK ONLY WATER SIX MONTHS LATER THE WOMEN 'S INFANTS
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@386.02:393.07 WERE OFFERED CEREAL MIXED WITH CARROT JUICE AND THEIR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS WERE OBSERVED WHILE THEY ATE IT
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@393.07:401.5 THE OFFSPRING OF THE CARROT JUICE DRINKING WOMEN ATE MORE CARROT FLAVORED CEREAL AND FROM THE LOOKS OF IT THEY SEEMED TO ENJOY IT MORE
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@401.5:415.39 A SORT OF FRENCH VERSION OF THIS EXPERIMENT WAS CARRIED OUT IN DIJON FRANCE WHERE RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT MOTHERS WHO CONSUMED FOOD AND DRINK FLAVORED WITH LICORICE FLAVORED ANISE
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@415.39:432.18 DURING PREGNANCY SHOWED A PREFERENCE FOR ANISE ON THEIR FIRST DAY OF LIFE AND AGAIN WHEN THEY WERE TESTED LATER ON THEIR FOURTH DAY OF LIFE BABIES WHOSE MOTHERS DID NOT EAT ANISE DURING PREGNANCY SHOWED A REACTION THAT TRANSLATED ROUGHLY AS YUCK
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@432.43:444.76 WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT FETUSES ARE EFFECTIVELY BEING TAUGHT BY THEIR MOTHERS ABOUT WHAT IS SAFE AND GOOD TO EAT FETUSES ARE ALSO BEING TAUGHT ABOUT THE PARTICULAR CULTURE THAT THEY 'LL BE JOINING
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@444.76:457.16 THROUGH ONE OF CULTURE 'S MOST POWERFUL EXPRESSIONS WHICH IS FOOD THEY 'RE BEING INTRODUCED TO THE CHARACTERISTIC FLAVORS AND SPICES OF THEIR CULTURE 'S CUISINE EVEN BEFORE BIRTH
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@457.16:466.3 NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT FETUSES ARE LEARNING EVEN BIGGER LESSONS BUT BEFORE I GET TO THAT I WANT TO ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT YOU MAY BE WONDERING ABOUT
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@466.3:485.54 THE NOTION OF FETAL LEARNING MAY CONJURE UP FOR YOU ATTEMPTS TO ENRICH THE FETUS LIKE PLAYING MOZART THROUGH HEADPHONES PLACED ON A PREGNANT BELLY BUT ACTUALLY THE NINE MONTH LONG PROCESS OF MOLDING AND SHAPING THAT GOES ON IN THE WOMB IS A LOT MORE VISCERAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL THAN THAT
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@485.54:489.9 MUCH OF WHAT A PREGNANT WOMAN ENCOUNTERS IN HER DAILY LIFE
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@489.9:509.6 THE AIR SHE BREATHES THE FOOD AND DRINK SHE CONSUMES THE CHEMICALS SHE 'S EXPOSED TO EVEN THE EMOTIONS SHE FEELS ARE SHARED IN SOME FASHION WITH HER FETUS THEY MAKE UP A MIX OF INFLUENCES AS INDIVIDUAL AND IDIOSYNCRATIC AS THE WOMAN HERSELF THE FETUS INCORPORATES
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@509.73:516.96 THESE OFFERINGS INTO ITS OWN BODY MAKES THEM PART OF ITS FLESH AND BLOOD AND OFTEN IT DOES SOMETHING MORE
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@517.04:526.11 IT TREATS THESE MATERNAL CONTRIBUTIONS AS INFORMATION AS WHAT I LIKE TO CALL BIOLOGICAL POSTCARDS FROM THE WORLD OUTSIDE
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@526.11:545.79 SO WHAT A FETUS IS LEARNING ABOUT IN UTERO IS NOT MOZART 'S MAGIC FLUTE BUT ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS MUCH MORE CRITICAL TO ITS SURVIVAL WILL IT BE BORN INTO A WORLD OF ABUNDANCE OR SCARCITY WILL IT BE SAFE AND PROTECTED OR WILL IT FACE CONSTANT DANGERS AND THREATS
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@545.79:559.42 WILL IT LIVE A LONG FRUITFUL LIFE OR A SHORT HARRIED ONE THE PREGNANT WOMAN 'S DIET AND STRESS LEVEL IN PARTICULAR PROVIDE IMPORTANT CLUES TO PREVAILING CONDITIONS LIKE A FINGER LIFTED TO THE WIND
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@559.42:570.37 THE RESULTING TUNING AND TWEAKING OF A FETUS BRAIN AND OTHER ORGANS ARE PART OF WHAT GIVE US HUMANS OUR ENORMOUS FLEXIBILITY OUR ABILITY TO THRIVE
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@585.4:594.74 IN THE AUTUMN OF ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THE DARKEST DAYS OF WORLD WAR II GERMAN TROOPS BLOCKADED WESTERN HOLLAND
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@594.74:606.6 TURNING AWAY ALL SHIPMENTS OF FOOD THE OPENING OF THE NAZI 'S SIEGE WAS FOLLOWED BY ONE OF THE HARSHEST WINTERS IN DECADES SO COLD THE WATER IN THE CANALS FROZE SOLID
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@606.6:621.63 SOON FOOD BECAME SCARCE WITH MANY DUTCH SURVIVING ON JUST FIVE HUNDRED CALORIES A DAY A QUARTER OF WHAT THEY CONSUMED BEFORE THE WAR AS WEEKS OF DEPRIVATION STRETCHED INTO MONTHS SOME RESORTED TO EATING TULIP BULBS
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@621.63:635.21 BY THE BEGINNING OF MAY THE NATION 'S CAREFULLY RATIONED FOOD RESERVE WAS COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED THE SPECTER OF MASS STARVATION LOOMED AND THEN ON MAY FIFTH ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE THE SIEGE CAME TO A SUDDEN END
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@635.33:646.5 WHEN HOLLAND WAS LIBERATED BY THE ALLIES THE HUNGER WINTER AS IT CAME TO BE KNOWN KILLED SOME TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE AND WEAKENED THOUSANDS MORE
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@646.65:653.94 BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER POPULATION THAT WAS AFFECTED THE FORTY THOUSAND FETUSES IN UTERO DURING THE SIEGE
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@667.68:675.06 DECADES AFTER THE HUNGER WINTER RESEARCHERS DOCUMENTED THAT PEOPLE WHOSE MOTHERS WERE PREGNANT DURING THE SIEGE
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@675.06:683.7 HAVE MORE OBESITY MORE DIABETES AND MORE HEART DISEASE IN LATER LIFE THAN INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE GESTATED UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@683.7:699.78 THESE INDIVIDUALS PRENATAL EXPERIENCE OF STARVATION SEEMS TO HAVE CHANGED THEIR BODIES IN MYRIAD WAYS THEY HAVE HIGHER BLOOD PRESSURE POORER CHOLESTEROL PROFILES AND REDUCED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE A PRECURSOR OF DIABETES
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@699.78:702.69 WHY WOULD UNDERNUTRITION IN THE WOMB
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@702.72:718.41 RESULT IN DISEASE LATER ONE EXPLANATION IS THAT FETUSES ARE MAKING THE BEST OF A BAD SITUATION WHEN FOOD IS SCARCE THEY DIVERT NUTRIENTS TOWARDS THE REALLY CRITICAL ORGAN THE BRAIN AND AWAY FROM OTHER ORGANS LIKE THE HEART AND LIVER
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@718.41:729.65 THIS KEEPS THE FETUS ALIVE IN THE SHORT TERM BUT THE BILL COMES DUE LATER ON IN LIFE WHEN THOSE OTHER ORGANS DEPRIVED EARLY ON BECOME MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DISEASE
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@729.65:739.89 BUT THAT MAY NOT BE ALL THAT 'S GOING ON IT SEEMS THAT FETUSES ARE TAKING CUES FROM THE INTRAUTERINE ENVIRONMENT AND TAILORING THEIR PHYSIOLOGY ACCORDINGLY
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@739.89:758.24 THEY 'RE PREPARING THEMSELVES FOR THE KIND OF WORLD THEY WILL ENCOUNTER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WOMB THE FETUS ADJUSTS ITS METABOLISM AND OTHER PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN ANTICIPATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT AWAITS IT AND THE BASIS OF THE FETUS PREDICTION IS WHAT ITS MOTHER EATS
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@758.24:768.03 THE MEALS A PREGNANT WOMAN CONSUMES CONSTITUTE A KIND OF STORY A FAIRY TALE OF ABUNDANCE OR A GRIM CHRONICLE OF DEPRIVATION
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@768.03:780.79 THIS STORY IMPARTS INFORMATION THAT THE FETUS USES TO ORGANIZE ITS BODY AND ITS SYSTEMS AN ADAPTATION TO PREVAILING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT FACILITATES ITS FUTURE SURVIVAL
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@780.79:790.31 FACED WITH SEVERELY LIMITED RESOURCES A SMALLER SIZED CHILD WITH REDUCED ENERGY REQUIREMENTS WILL IN FACT HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF LIVING TO ADULTHOOD
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@790.31:802.35 THE REAL TROUBLE COMES WHEN PREGNANT WOMEN ARE IN A SENSE UNRELIABLE NARRATORS WHEN FETUSES ARE LED TO EXPECT A WORLD OF SCARCITY AND ARE BORN INSTEAD INTO A WORLD OF PLENTY
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@802.35:810.9 THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CHILDREN OF THE DUTCH HUNGER WINTER AND THEIR HIGHER RATES OF OBESITY DIABETES AND HEART DISEASE ARE THE RESULT
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@826.65:839.12 HERE 'S ANOTHER STORY AT EIGHT FORTY SIX A M ON SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH TWO THOUSAND AND ONE THERE WERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THE VICINITY OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER IN NEW YORK
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@839.46:847.92 COMMUTERS SPILLING OFF TRAINS WAITRESSES SETTING TABLES FOR THE MORNING RUSH BROKERS ALREADY WORKING THE PHONES ON WALL STREET
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@851.59:871.07 WHEN THE PLANES STRUCK AND THE TOWERS COLLAPSED MANY OF THESE WOMEN EXPERIENCED THE SAME HORRORS INFLICTED ON OTHER SURVIVORS OF THE DISASTER THE OVERWHELMING CHAOS AND CONFUSION THE ROLLING CLOUDS OF POTENTIALLY TOXIC DUST AND DEBRIS THE HEART POUNDING FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@871.07:879.06 ABOUT A YEAR AFTER NINE ELEVEN RESEARCHERS EXAMINED A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER ATTACK
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@879.06:886.31 IN THE BABIES OF THOSE WOMEN WHO DEVELOPED POST TRAUMATIC STRESS SYNDROME OR PTSD FOLLOWING THEIR ORDEAL
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@886.33:894.39 RESEARCHERS DISCOVERED A BIOLOGICAL MARKER OF SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PTSD AN EFFECT THAT WAS MOST PRONOUNCED
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@894.39:910.54 IN INFANTS WHOSE MOTHERS EXPERIENCED THE CATASTROPHE IN THEIR THIRD TRIMESTER IN OTHER WORDS THE MOTHERS WITH POST TRAUMATIC STRESS SYNDROME HAD PASSED ON A VULNERABILITY TO THE CONDITION TO THEIR CHILDREN WHILE THEY WERE STILL IN UTERO
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@910.54:924.82 NOW CONSIDER THIS POST TRAUMATIC STRESS SYNDROME APPEARS TO BE A REACTION TO STRESS GONE VERY WRONG CAUSING ITS VICTIMS TREMENDOUS UNNECESSARY SUFFERING BUT THERE 'S ANOTHER WAY OF THINKING ABOUT PTSD
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@924.82:943.81 WHAT LOOKS LIKE PATHOLOGY TO US MAY ACTUALLY BE A USEFUL ADAPTATION IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES IN A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT THE CHARACTERISTIC MANIFESTATIONS OF PTSD A HYPER AWARENESS OF ONE 'S SURROUNDINGS A QUICK TRIGGER RESPONSE TO DANGER
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@943.81:945.83 COULD SAVE SOMEONE 'S LIFE
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@945.83:964.46 THE NOTION THAT THE PRENATAL TRANSMISSION OF PTSD RISK IS ADAPTIVE IS STILL SPECULATIVE BUT I FIND IT RATHER POIGNANT IT WOULD MEAN THAT EVEN BEFORE BIRTH MOTHERS ARE WARNING THEIR CHILDREN THAT IT 'S A WILD WORLD OUT THERE TELLING THEM BE CAREFUL
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@964.46:984.11 LET ME BE CLEAR FETAL ORIGINS RESEARCH IS NOT ABOUT BLAMING WOMEN FOR WHAT HAPPENS DURING PREGNANCY IT 'S ABOUT DISCOVERING HOW BEST TO PROMOTE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THE NEXT GENERATION THAT IMPORTANT EFFORT MUST INCLUDE A FOCUS ON WHAT FETUSES LEARN DURING THE NINE MONTHS THEY SPEND IN THE WOMB
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G@984.93:992.41 LEARNING IS ONE OF LIFE 'S MOST ESSENTIAL ACTIVITIES AND IT BEGINS MUCH EARLIER THAN WE EVER IMAGINED THANK YOU
