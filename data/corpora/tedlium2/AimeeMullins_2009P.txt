AimeeMullins_2009P@104.3:109.73 UH AND AND IMPACT THAT THE ASSAULT FROM THESE WORDS UNLEASHED
AimeeMullins_2009P@109.73:121.23 YOU KNOW HUM OF COURSE THIS IS MY RAGGEDY OLD THESAURUS I 'M THINKING THIS MUST BE AN ANCIENT PRINT DATE RIGHT BUT IN FACT THE PRINT DATE WAS THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES
AimeeMullins_2009P@121.23:135.45 WHEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN STARTING PRIMARY SCHOOL AND FORMING AN UNDERSTANDING OF MYSELF OUTSIDE THE FAMILY UNIT AND AS RELATED TO THE OTHER KIDS AND THE WORLD AROUND ME AND NEEDLESS TO SAY THANK GOD I WASN 'T USING A THESAURUS BACK THEN
AimeeMullins_2009P@135.45:149.51 I MEAN FROM THIS ENTRY IT WOULD SEEM THAT I WAS BORN INTO A WORLD THAT PERCEIVED SOMEONE LIKE ME TO HAVE NOTHING POSITIVE WHATSOEVER GOING FOR THEM WHEN IN FACT TODAY
AimeeMullins_2009P@149.51:158.66 I 'M CELEBRATED FOR UH THE OPPORTUNITIES AND ADVENTURES MY LIFE HAS PROCURED SO UH I IMMEDIATELY
AimeeMullins_2009P@158.66:168.44 WENT TO LOOK UP THE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE UH ONLINE EDITION EXPECTING TO FIND A REVISION WORTH NOTING HERE 'S THE UPDATED VERSION OF THIS ENTRY
AimeeMullins_2009P@168.44:180.666 UNFORTUNATELY IT 'S NOT MUCH BETTER I FIND THE THE LAST TWO WORDS UNDER NEAR ANTONYMS PARTICULARLY UNSETTLING WHOLE AND WHOLESOME

AimeeMullins_2009P@182.278:184.84 SO IT 'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE WORDS
AimeeMullins_2009P@184.84:196.18 IT 'S WHAT WE BELIEVE ABOUT PEOPLE WHEN WE NAME THEM WITH THESE WORDS IT 'S ABOUT THE VALUES BEHIND THE WORDS AND HOW WE CONSTRUCT THOSE VALUES OUR LANGUAGE AFFECTS OUR THINKING
AimeeMullins_2009P@196.18:206.58 AND HOW WE VIEW THE WORLD AND HOW WE VIEW OTHER PEOPLE IN FACT MANY ANCIENT SOCIETIES INCLUDING THE GREEKS AND THE ROMANS BELIEVED THAT TO UTTER A CURSE
AimeeMullins_2009P@206.58:214.08 VERBALLY WAS SO POWERFUL BECAUSE TO SAY THE THING OUT LOUD BROUGHT IT INTO EXISTENCE
AimeeMullins_2009P@214.08:215.588 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
AimeeMullins_2009P@215.588:225.37 SO WHAT REALITY DO WE WANT TO CALL INTO EXISTENCE A PERSON WHO IS LIMITED OR A PERSON WHO 'S EMPOWERED
AimeeMullins_2009P@225.37:225.962 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
AimeeMullins_2009P@225.962:232.19 BY CASUALLY DOING SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS NAMING A PERSON A CHILD
AimeeMullins_2009P@232.19:242.6 WE MIGHT BE PUTTING LIDS AND CASTING SHADOWS ON THEIR POWER WOULDN 'T WE WANT TO OPEN DOORS FOR THEM INSTEAD
AimeeMullins_2009P@242.6:253.18 ONE SUCH PERSON WHO OPENED DOORS FOR ME WAS MY CHILDHOOD DOCTOR AT THE A I DUPONT INSTITUTE IN WILMINGTON DELAWARE HIS NAME IS DOCTOR PIZZUTILLO
AimeeMullins_2009P@253.18:261.72 HUM IT'S AN ITALIAN AMERICAN WHOSE NAME APPARENTLY WAS TOO DIFFICULT FOR MOST AMERICANS TO PRONOUNCE SO HE WENT BY DOCTOR P AND DOCTOR P
AimeeMullins_2009P@261.72:269.226 ALWAYS WORE REALLY COLORFUL BOW TIES AND HUM HAD THE VERY PERFECT DISPOSITION TO WORK WITH CHILDREN
AimeeMullins_2009P@269.226:278.63 I LOVED ALMOST EVERYTHING ABOUT MY TIME SPENT AT THIS HOSPITAL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MY PHYSICAL THERAPY SESSIONS
AimeeMullins_2009P@278.63:289.48 I HAD TO DO WHAT SEEMED LIKE INNUMERABLE REPETITIONS OF EXERCISES WITH THESE THICK ELASTIC BANDS UH DIFFERENT COLORS YOU KNOW
AimeeMullins_2009P@289.48:296.89 TO HELP BUILD UP MY LEG MUSCLES AND I HATED THESE BANDS MORE THAN ANYTHING I HATED THEM HAD NAMES FOR THEM I HATED THEM AND
AimeeMullins_2009P@296.89:304.81 YOU KNOW I WAS ALREADY BARGAINING AS A FIVE YEAR OLD CHILD WITH DOCTOR P TO TRY TO GET OUT OF DOING THESE EXERCISES UNSUCCESSFULLY OF COURSE
AimeeMullins_2009P@304.81:312.78 AND ONE DAY HE CAME IN TO MY SESSION HUM EXHAUSTIVE AND UNFORGIVING
AimeeMullins_2009P@312.78:320.2 THESE SESSIONS AND HE SAID TO ME WOW AIMEE YOU ARE SUCH A STRONG POWERFUL LITTLE GIRL
AimeeMullins_2009P@320.2:329.56 I THINK YOU 'RE GOING TO BREAK ONE OF THOSE BANDS WHEN YOU DO BREAK IT I 'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A HUNDRED BUCKS NOW OF COURSE THIS THIS WAS A SIMPLE PLOY
AimeeMullins_2009P@329.56:338.02 ON DOCTOR P 'S PART TO GET ME TO DO THE EXERCISES I DIDN 'T WANT TO DO BEFORE THE PROSPECT OF BEING THE RICHEST FIVE YEAR OLD IN THE SECOND FLOOR WARD
AimeeMullins_2009P@338.02:349.47 BUT WHAT HE EFFECTIVELY DID FOR ME WAS RESHAPE AN AWFUL DAILY OCCURRENCE INTO A NEW AND PROMISING EXPERIENCE FOR ME
AimeeMullins_2009P@349.47:356.864 AND I HAVE TO WONDER TODAY TO WHAT EXTENT HIS VISION AND HIS DECLARATION OF ME
AimeeMullins_2009P@356.864:367.83 AS A STRONG AND POWERFUL LITTLE GIRL SHAPED MY OWN VIEW OF MYSELF AS AN INHERENTLY STRONG POWERFUL AND ATHLETIC PERSON WELL INTO THE FUTURE
AimeeMullins_2009P@367.83:374.854 THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW ADULTS IN POSITIONS OF POWER CAN IGNITE THE POWER OF A CHILD
AimeeMullins_2009P@374.854:385.51 BUT IN THE PREVIOUS INSTANCES OF THOSE THESAURUS ENTRIES OUR LANGUAGE ISN 'T ALLOWING US TO EVOLVE INTO THE REALITY THAT WE WOULD ALL WANT
AimeeMullins_2009P@385.51:391.01 THE POSSIBILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL TO SEE THEMSELVES AS CAPABLE
AimeeMullins_2009P@391.01:392.278 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
AimeeMullins_2009P@392.278:402.35 OUR LANGUAGE HASN 'T CAUGHT UP WITH THE CHANGES IN OUR SOCIETY MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY TECHNOLOGY CERTAINLY FROM A MEDICAL STANDPOINT
AimeeMullins_2009P@402.35:419.4 MY LEGS HUM YOU KNOW LASER SURGERY FOR VISION IMPAIRMENT UH TITANIUM KNEE AND HIP REPLACEMENTS FOR AGING BODIES THAT ARE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO MORE FULLY ENGAGE WITH THEIR ABILITIES AND MOVE BEYOND THE LIMITS THAT NATURE HAS IMPOSED ON THEM
AimeeMullins_2009P@419.4:431.92 NOT TO MENTION SOCIAL NETWORKING PLATFORMS ALLOW PEOPLE TO SELF IDENTIFY TO CLAIM THEIR OWN DESCRIPTIONS OF THEMSELVES SO THEY CAN GO ALIGN WITH GLOBAL GROUPS OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING
AimeeMullins_2009P@431.92:433.237 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
AimeeMullins_2009P@433.237:446.75 SO PERHAPS TECHNOLOGY IS REVEALING MORE CLEARLY TO US NOW WHAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A TRUTH THAT EVERYONE HAS SOMETHING RARE AND POWERFUL TO OFFER OUR SOCIETY
AimeeMullins_2009P@446.75:447.76 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
AimeeMullins_2009P@447.76:458.08 AND THAT THE HUMAN ABILITY TO ADAPT IS OUR GREATEST ASSET THE HUMAN ABILITY TO ADAPT IT 'S AN INTERESTING THING BECAUSE PEOPLE
AimeeMullins_2009P@458.08:462.272 HAVE CONTINUALLY WANTED TO TALK TO ME ABOUT OVERCOMING ADVERSITY
AimeeMullins_2009P@462.272:474.43 AND I 'M GOING TO MAKE AN ADMISSION THIS PHRASE NEVER SAT RIGHT WITH ME AND I ALWAYS FELT UNEASY TRYING TO ANSWER PEOPLE 'S QUESTIONS ABOUT IT AND I THINK I 'M STARTING TO FIGURE OUT WHY
AimeeMullins_2009P@474.43:483.16 IMPLICIT IN THIS PHRASE OF OVERCOMING ADVERSITY IS THE IDEA THAT SUCCESS OR HAPPINESS
AimeeMullins_2009P@483.16:491.71 IS ABOUT EMERGING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A CHALLENGING EXPERIENCE UNSCATHED OR UNMARKED BY THE EXPERIENCE
AimeeMullins_2009P@491.71:502.676 AS IF MY SUCCESSES IN LIFE HAVE COME ABOUT FROM AN ABILITY TO SIDESTEP OR CIRCUMNAVIGATE THE PRESUMED PITFALLS OF A LIFE WITH PROSTHETICS OR WHAT OTHER PEOPLE PERCEIVE AS MY DISABILITY
AimeeMullins_2009P@502.676:515.12 BUT IN FACT WE ARE CHANGED WE ARE MARKED OF COURSE BY A CHALLENGE WHETHER PHYSICALLY EMOTIONALLY OR BOTH AND I AM GOING TO SUGGEST THAT THIS IS A GOOD THING
AimeeMullins_2009P@515.12:524.35 ADVERSITY ISN 'T AN OBSTACLE THAT WE NEED TO GET AROUND IN ORDER TO RESUME LIVING OUR LIFE IT 'S PART OF OUR LIFE
AimeeMullins_2009P@524.35:533.17 AND I TEND TO THINK OF IT LIKE MY SHADOW SOMETIMES I SEE A LOT OF IT SOMETIMES THERE 'S VERY LITTLE BUT IT 'S ALWAYS WITH ME
AimeeMullins_2009P@533.17:541.35 AND CERTAINLY I 'M NOT TRYING TO DIMINISH THE IMPACT THE WEIGHT OF A PERSON 'S STRUGGLE THERE IS
AimeeMullins_2009P@541.35:552.15 ADVERSITY AND CHALLENGE IN LIFE AND IT 'S ALL VERY REAL AND RELATIVE TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON BUT THE QUESTION ISN 'T WHETHER OR NOT YOU 'RE GOING TO MEET ADVERSITY BUT HOW YOU 'RE GOING TO MEET IT
AimeeMullins_2009P@552.15:562.79 SO OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT SIMPLY SHIELDING THOSE WE CARE FOR FROM ADVERSITY BUT PREPARING THEM TO MEET IT WELL
AimeeMullins_2009P@562.79:573.75 AND WE DO A DISSERVICE TO OUR KIDS WHEN WE MAKE THEM FEEL THAT THEY 'RE NOT EQUIPPED TO ADAPT
AimeeMullins_2009P@573.75:587.55 THERE 'S AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE AND DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE OBJECTIVE MEDICAL FACT OF MY BEING AN AMPUTEE AND THE SUBJECTIVE SOCIETAL OPINION OF WHETHER OR NOT I 'M DISABLED
AimeeMullins_2009P@587.55:599.168 AND TRUTHFULLY THE ONLY REAL AND CONSISTENT DISABILITY I 'VE HAD TO CONFRONT IS THE WORLD EVER THINKING THAT I COULD BE DESCRIBED BY THOSE DEFINITIONS
AimeeMullins_2009P@599.168:606.64 IN OUR DESIRE TO PROTECT THOSE WE CARE ABOUT BY GIVING THEM THE COLD HARD TRUTH ABOUT THEIR MEDICAL PROGNOSIS
AimeeMullins_2009P@606.64:616.24 OR INDEED A PROGNOSIS ON THE EXPECTED QUALITY OF THEIR LIFE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON 'T PUT THE FIRST BRICK IN A WALL THAT WILL ACTUALLY
AimeeMullins_2009P@616.24:625.91 DISABLE SOMEONE PERHAPS THE EXISTING MODEL OF ONLY LOOKING AT WHAT IS BROKEN IN YOU AND HOW DO WE FIX IT
AimeeMullins_2009P@625.91:635.63 SERVES TO BE MORE DISABLING TO THE INDIVIDUAL THAN THE PATHOLOGY ITSELF BY NOT TREATING THE WHOLENESS OF A PERSON
AimeeMullins_2009P@635.63:644.4 BY NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR POTENCY WE ARE CREATING ANOTHER ILL ON TOP OF WHATEVER NATURAL STRUGGLE THEY MIGHT HAVE
AimeeMullins_2009P@644.4:659.37 WE ARE EFFECTIVELY GRADING SOMEONE 'S WORTH TO OUR COMMUNITY SO WE NEED TO SEE THROUGH THE PATHOLOGY AND INTO THE RANGE OF HUMAN CAPABILITY
AimeeMullins_2009P@659.37:669.29 AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THERE 'S A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THOSE PERCEIVED DEFICIENCIES AND OUR GREATEST CREATIVE ABILITY
AimeeMullins_2009P@669.29:681.08 SO IT 'S NOT ABOUT DEVALUING OR NEGATING THESE MORE TRYING TIMES AS SOMETHING WE WANT TO AVOID OR SWEEP UNDER THE RUG BUT INSTEAD TO FIND THOSE OPPORTUNITIES
AimeeMullins_2009P@681.08:693.7 WRAPPED IN THE ADVERSITY SO MAYBE THE IDEA I WANT TO PUT OUT THERE IS NOT SO MUCH OVERCOMING ADVERSITY AS IT IS OPENING OURSELVES UP TO IT
AimeeMullins_2009P@693.7:695.864 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
AimeeMullins_2009P@695.864:704.018 EMBRACING IT GRAPPLING WITH IT TO USE A WRESTLING TERM MAYBE EVEN DANCING WITH IT
AimeeMullins_2009P@704.018:705.69 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
AimeeMullins_2009P@705.69:716.87 AND PERHAPS IF WE SEE ADVERSITY AS NATURAL CONSISTENT AND USEFUL WE 'RE LESS BURDENED BY THE PRESENCE OF IT
AimeeMullins_2009P@716.87:729.03 THIS YEAR WE CELEBRATE THE TWO HUNDRETH BIRTHDAY OF CHARLES DARWIN AND IT WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN WRITING ABOUT EVOLUTION THAT DARWIN ILLUSTRATED I THINK A TRUTH ABOUT THE HUMAN CHARACTER
AimeeMullins_2009P@729.03:741.1 TO PARAPHRASE IT 'S NOT THE STRONGEST OF THE SPECIES THAT SURVIVES NOR IS IT THE MOST INTELLIGENT THAT SURVIVES IT IS THE ONE THAT IS MOST ADAPTABLE TO CHANGE
AimeeMullins_2009P@741.1:753.91 CONFLICT IS THE GENESIS OF CREATION FROM DARWIN 'S WORK AMONGST OTHERS WE CAN RECOGNIZE THAT THE HUMAN ABILITY TO SURVIVE AND FLOURISH
AimeeMullins_2009P@753.91:765.87 IS DRIVEN BY THE THE STRUGGLE OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT THROUGH CONFLICT INTO TRANSFORMATION SO AGAIN TRANSFORMATION ADAPTATION IS OUR GREATEST
AimeeMullins_2009P@765.87:779.774 HUMAN SKILL AND PERHAPS YOU KNOW UNTIL WE 'RE TESTED WE DON 'T KNOW WHAT WE 'RE MADE OF MAYBE THAT 'S WHAT ADVERSITY GIVES US A SENSE OF SELF A SENSE OF OUR OWN POWER
AimeeMullins_2009P@779.774:790.16 SO WE CAN GIVE OURSELVES A GIFT WE CAN RE IMAGINE ADVERSITY AS SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST TOUGH TIMES
AimeeMullins_2009P@790.16:798.72 MAYBE WE CAN SEE IT AS CHANGE ADVERSITY IS JUST CHANGE THAT WE HAVEN 'T ADAPTED OURSELVES TO YET
AimeeMullins_2009P@798.72:804.38 I THINK THE GREATEST ADVERSITY THAT WE 'VE CREATED FOR OURSELVES IS THIS IDEA OF NORMALCY
AimeeMullins_2009P@804.38:811.66 NOW WHO 'S NORMAL THERE 'S NO NORMAL THERE 'S COMMON THERE 'S TYPICAL
AimeeMullins_2009P@811.66:821.97 THERE 'S NO NORMAL AND WOULD YOU WANT TO MEET THAT POOR BEIGE PERSON IF THEY EXISTED I DON 'T THINK SO IF WE CAN CHANGE THIS PARADIGM FROM ONE OF
AimeeMullins_2009P@821.97:835.09 ACHIEVING NORMALCY TO ONE OF POSSIBILITY OR POTENCY TO BE EVEN A LITTLE BIT MORE DANGEROUS WE CAN RELEASE THE POWER OF SO MANY MORE CHILDREN AND INVITE THEM TO ENGAGE
AimeeMullins_2009P@835.09:849.25 THEIR RARE AND VALUABLE ABILITIES WITH THE COMMUNITY ANTHROPOLOGISTS TELL US THAT THE ONE THING WE AS HUMANS HAVE ALWAYS REQUIRED OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS IS TO BE OF USE TO BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE
AimeeMullins_2009P@849.25:859.68 THERE 'S EVIDENCE THAT NEANDERTHALS SIXTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO CARRIED THEIR ELDERLY AND THOSE WITH SERIOUS PHYSICAL INJURY
AimeeMullins_2009P@859.68:868.86 AND PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE THE LIFE EXPERIENCE OF SURVIVAL OF THESE PEOPLE PROVED OF VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY
AimeeMullins_2009P@868.86:876.84 THEY DIDN 'T VIEW THESE PEOPLE AS BROKEN AND USELESS THEY WERE SEEN AS RARE AND VALUABLE
AimeeMullins_2009P@876.84:883.06 FEW YEARS AGO I WAS IN A FOOD MARKET IN THE TOWN WHERE I GREW UP IN THAT RED ZONE IN NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA
AimeeMullins_2009P@883.06:892.05 AND I WAS STANDING OVER A BUSHEL OF TOMATOES IT WAS SUMMER TIME I HAD SHORTS ON I HEAR THIS GUY HIS VOICE BEHIND ME SAY WELL IF IT ISN 'T AIMEE MULLINS
AimeeMullins_2009P@892.05:899.05 AND I TURN AROUND AND IT 'S THIS OLDER MAN I HAVE NO IDEA WHO HE IS AND I SAID I 'M SORRY SIR I DON 'T
AimeeMullins_2009P@899.05:907.2 HAVE WE MET I I DON 'T REMEMBER MEETING YOU HE SAID WELL YOU WOULDN 'T REMEMBER MEETING ME I MEAN WHEN WE MET I WAS DELIVERING YOU FROM YOUR MOTHER 'S WOMB
AimeeMullins_2009P@907.2:913.63 OH THAT GUY AND BUT OF COURSE ACTUALLY
AimeeMullins_2009P@913.63:922.62 IT DID CLICK THIS MAN WAS DOCTOR KEAN A MAN I HAD ONLY KNOWN ABOUT THROUGH MY MOTHER 'S STORIES OF THAT DAY BECAUSE OF COURSE
AimeeMullins_2009P@922.62:935.65 TYPICAL FASHION I ARRIVED LATE FOR MY BIRTHDAY BY TWO WEEKS AN SO MY MOTHER 'S PRENATAL PHYSICIAN HAD GONE ON VACATION SO THE MAN WHO DELIVERED ME WAS A COMPLETE STRANGER TO MY PARENTS
AimeeMullins_2009P@935.65:944.78 AND BECAUSE I WAS BORN WITHOUT THE FIBULA BONES AND HAD FEET TURNED IN AND A FEW TOES IN THIS FOOT AND A FEW TOES IN THAT HE HAD TO BE THE BEARER THIS STRANGER
AimeeMullins_2009P@944.78:953.39 HAD TO BE THE BEARER OF BAD NEWS HE SAID TO ME I HAD TO GIVE THIS PROGNOSIS TO YOUR PARENTS THAT YOU WOULD NEVER WALK
AimeeMullins_2009P@953.39:961.216 AND YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE THE KIND OF MOBILITY THAT OTHER KIDS HAVE OR ANY KIND OF LIFE OF INDEPENDENCE AND YOU 'VE BEEN MAKING LIAR OUT OF ME EVER SINCE

AimeeMullins_2009P@969.39:975.77 THE EXTRAORDINARY THING IS THAT HE SAID HE HAD SAVED NEWSPAPER CLIPPING THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD
AimeeMullins_2009P@975.77:985.93 WHETHER WINNING A SECOND GRADE SPELLING BEE MARCHING WITH THE GIRL SCOUTS YOU KNOW THE HALLOWEEN PARADE WINNING MY COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP OR ANY OF MY SPORTS VICTORIES
AimeeMullins_2009P@985.93:994.17 AND HE WAS USING IT AND INTEGRATING IT INTO TEACHING UH RESIDENT STUDENTS MED STUDENTS FROM HAHNEMANN
AimeeMullins_2009P@994.17:1002.99 MEDICAL SCHOOL AND HERSHEY MEDICAL SCHOOL AND HE CALLED THIS PART OF THE COURSE THE X FACTOR THE POTENTIAL OF THE HUMAN WILL
AimeeMullins_2009P@1002.99:1011.28 NO PROGNOSIS CAN ACCOUNT FOR HOW POWERFUL THIS COULD BE AND A AS A DETERMINANT IN THE QUALITY OF SOMEONE 'S LIFE
AimeeMullins_2009P@1011.28:1022.04 AND DOCTOR KEAN WENT ON TO TELL ME THAT HE SAID IN MY EXPERIENCE UNLESS REPEATEDLY TOLD OTHERWISE
AimeeMullins_2009P@1022.04:1031.66 AND EVEN IF GIVEN A MODICUM OF SUPPORT IF LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES A CHILD WILL ACHIEVE
AimeeMullins_2009P@1031.66:1041.97 SEE DOCTOR KEAN MADE THAT SHIFT IN THINKING HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE 'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MEDICAL CONDITION AND WHAT SOMEONE MIGHT DO WITH IT
AimeeMullins_2009P@1041.97:1055.78 AND THERE 'S BEEN A SHIFT IN MY THINKING OVER TIME IN THAT IF YOU 'D ASKED ME AT FIFTEEN YEARS OLD IF I WOULD HAVE TRADED PROSTHETICS FOR FLESH AND BONE LEGS I WOULDN 'T HAVE HESITATED FOR A SECOND
AimeeMullins_2009P@1055.78:1065.39 I ASPIRED TO THAT KIND OF NORMALCY BACK THEN IF YOU ASK ME TODAY I 'M NOT SO SURE
AimeeMullins_2009P@1065.39:1075.71 AND IT 'S BECAUSE OF THE EXPERIENCES I 'VE HAD WITH THEM NOT IN SPITE OF THE EXPERIENCES I 'VE HAD WITH THEM
AimeeMullins_2009P@1075.71:1090.7 AND PERHAPS THIS SHIFT IN ME HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE I 'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO MORE PEOPLE WHO HAVE OPENED DOORS FOR ME THAN THOSE WHO HAVE PUT LIDS AND CAST SHADOWS ON ME
AimeeMullins_2009P@1090.7:1101.7 SEE ALL YOU REALLY NEED IS ONE PERSON TO SHOW YOU THE EPIPHANY OF YOUR OWN POWER AND YOU 'RE OFF IF YOU CAN HAND SOMEBODY THE KEY
AimeeMullins_2009P@1101.7:1112.4 TO THEIR OWN POWER THE HUMAN SPIRIT IS SO RECEPTIVE IF YOU CAN DO THAT AND OPEN A DOOR FOR SOMEONE AT A CRUCIAL MOMENT YOU ARE EDUCATING THEM IN THE BEST SENSE
AimeeMullins_2009P@1112.4:1121.74 YOU 'RE TEACHING THEM TO OPEN DOORS FOR THEMSELVES IN FACT THE THE EXACT MEANING OF THE WORD EDUCATE
AimeeMullins_2009P@1121.74:1133.61 COMES FROM THE ROOT WORD EDUCE IT MEANS TO BRING FORTH WHAT IS WITHIN TO BRING OUT POTENTIAL SO AGAIN WHICH POTENTIAL DO WE WANT TO BRING OUT

AimeeMullins_2009P@1135.42:1145.66 THERE WAS A CASE STUDY DONE IN NINETEEN SIXTIES IN BRITAIN WHEN THEY WERE MOVING FROM GRAMMAR SCHOOLS TO COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS IT 'S CALLED THE STREAMING TRIALS WE CALL IT TRACKING
AimeeMullins_2009P@1145.66:1151.07 HERE IN THE STATES IT 'S SEPARATING STUDENTS FROM A B C D AND SO ON
AimeeMullins_2009P@1151.07:1165.65 AND YOU KNOW THE A STUDENTS GET THE TOUGHER CURRICULUM THE BEST TEACHERS ETC WELL THEY TOOK OVER A THREE MONTH PERIOD D LEVEL STUDENTS GAVE THEM A 'S TOLD THEM THEY WERE A 'S TOLD THEM THEY WERE BRIGHT AND AT THE END OF THIS THREE MONTH PERIOD
AimeeMullins_2009P@1165.65:1174.92 THEY WERE PERFORMING AT A LEVEL AND OF COURSE THE HEARTBREAKING FLIP SIDE OF THIS STUDY IS THAT THEY TOOK THE A STUDENTS
AimeeMullins_2009P@1174.92:1184.08 AND TOLD THEM THEY WERE D 'S AND THAT 'S WHAT HAPPENED AT THE END OF THAT THREE MONTH PERIOD THOSE WHO WERE STILL AROUND IN SCHOOL BESIDES THE PEOPLE WHO HAD DROPPED OUT

AimeeMullins_2009P@1186.39:1194.84 THIS IS A CRUCIAL PART OF THIS CASE STUDY WAS THAT THE TEACHERS WERE DUPED TOO
AimeeMullins_2009P@1194.84:1203.62 THE TEACHERS DIDN 'T KNOW A SWITCH HAD BEEN MADE THEY WERE SIMPLY TOLD THESE ARE THE A STUDENTS THESE ARE THE D STUDENTS AND THAT 'S HOW THEY WENT ABOUT TEACHING THEM
AimeeMullins_2009P@1203.62:1209.98 AND TREATING THEM SO I THINK
AimeeMullins_2009P@1209.98:1212.73 THAT THE ONLY TRUE DISABILITY
AimeeMullins_2009P@1212.73:1223.82 IS A CRUSHED SPIRIT A SPIRIT THAT 'S BEEN CRUSHED DOESN 'T HAVE HOPE IT DOESN 'T SEE BEAUTY
AimeeMullins_2009P@1223.82:1230.96 IT NO LONGER HAS OUR NATURAL CHILDLIKE CURIOSITY AND OUR INNATE ABILITY TO IMAGINE

AimeeMullins_2009P@1232.86:1241.12 IF INSTEAD WE CAN BOLSTER A HUMAN SPIRIT TO KEEP HOPE TO SEE BEAUTY IN THEMSELVES AND OTHERS
AimeeMullins_2009P@1241.12:1247.94 TO BE CURIOUS AND IMAGINATIVE THEN WE ARE TRULY USING OUR POWER WELL
AimeeMullins_2009P@1247.94:1256.8 WHEN A SPIRIT HAS THOSE QUALITIES WE ARE ABLE TO CREATE NEW REALITIES AND NEW WAYS OF BEING
AimeeMullins_2009P@1256.8:1263.35 I 'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH A POEM BY A FOURTEENTH CENTURY PERSIAN POET NAMED HAFIZ
AimeeMullins_2009P@1263.35:1272.91 THAT MY FRIEND JACQUES DEMBOIS TOLD ME ABOUT AND THE POEM IS CALLED THE GOD WHO ONLY KNOWS FOUR WORDS EVERY CHILD
