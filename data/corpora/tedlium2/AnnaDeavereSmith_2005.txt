AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@254.87:256.67 THE TRUTH WAS THE LAW WAS THAT
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@258.86:261.02 YOU SEE AND HUCK GETS ON THE RAFT
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@325.71:330.93 AND MORE AND MORE LESS AND LESS AWARENESS OF THE PAIN OR THE OTHER
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@343.53:343.74 AND
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@348.16:348.83 KIDS I
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@352.77:353.20 THAT'S
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@362.49:370.21 TALK ABOUT RISK TAKING I'M GOING TO DO SOMEBODY THAT NOBODY LIKES YOU KNOW MOST ACTORS WANT TO DO CHARACTERS THAT ARE
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@371.55:380.23 WELL NOT ALWAYS BUT THE NOTION ESPECIALLY AT A CONFERENCE LIKE THIS I LIKE TO INSPIRE PEOPLE BUT SINCE THIS WAS CALLED RISK TAKING I'M DOING SOMEBODY WHO I NEVER DO
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@380.76:386.10 BECAUSE SHE'S SO UNLIKEABLE THAT ONE PERSON ACTUALLY CAME BACKSTAGE AND TOLD ME TO TAKE HER OUT OF THE SHOW SHE
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@390.88:401.04 LIKE THIS AS A GOOD THING BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN OTHER CONNOTATIONS TO THE WORD RISK AND THE SAME THING ABOUT THE WORD NATURE WHAT IS NATURE MAXINE GREENE WHO 'S A WONDERFUL PHILOSOPHER WHO 'S
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@402.94:412.18 AND WAS THE HEAD OF A PHILOSOPHY GREAT BIG PHILOSOPHY KIND OF AN ORGANIZATION I WENT TO HER AND ASKED HER WHAT ARE THE TWO THINGS THAT SHE DOESN'T
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@412.59:418.67 KNOW THAT SHE STILL WANTS TO KNOW AND SHE SAID WELL PERSONALLY I STILL FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO CURTSEY WHEN I SEE THE PRESIDENT OF MY UNIVERSITY
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@419.17:433.27 AND I STILL FEEL AS THOUGH I'VE GOT TO GET COFFEE FOR MY MALE COLLEAGUES EVEN THOUGH I'VE OUTLIVED MOST OF THEM AND SHE SAID AND THEN INTELLECTUALLY I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE NEGATIVE IMAGINATION AND SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH CERTAINLY TAUGHT US THAT THAT'S A WHOLE AREA WE DON'T INVESTIGATE SO
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@433.70:446.41 THIS PIECE IS ABOUT A NEGATIVE IMAGINATION IT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT NATURE IS WHAT MOTHER NATURE IS AND ABOUT WHAT A RISK CAN BE AND I GOT THIS IN THE MARYLAND CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTE FOR WOMEN EVERYTHING I DO IS WORD FOR WORD
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@446.79:455.65 OFF OF A TAPE AND I TITLE THINGS BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE SPEAK IN ORGANIC POEMS AND THIS IS CALLED A MIRROR TO HER MOUTH AND THIS IS AN INMATE NAMED PAULETTE JENKINS
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@462.69:464.90 I BEGAN TO LEARN HOW TO COVER
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@467.36:471.56 BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT NOBODY TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING IN MY HOME
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@472.53:476.78 I WANT EVERYBODY TO THINK WE WERE A NORMAL FAMILY I MEAN WE HAD ALL THE MATERIALISTIC
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@485.23:489.70 RAN OUT OF EXCUSES ABOUT HOW WE GOT BLACK EYES AND BUSTED LIPS AND BRUISES
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@490.20:492.45 I DIDN'T HAD NO MORE EXCUSES AND HE BEAT ME
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@493.48:497.52 BUT THAT DIDN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT IT WAS A NIGHTMARE FOR MY FAMILY IT WAS A NIGHTMARE
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@498.80:503.76 AND I FAILED THEM DRAMATICALLY BECAUSE I ALLOWED IT TO GO ON AND ON AND ON
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@504.55:514.19 BUT THE NIGHT THAT MYESHA GOT KILLED AND THE INTENSITY JUST GREW AND GREW AND GREW UNTIL ONE NIGHT WE CAME HOME FROM GETTING DRUGS
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@515.42:518.48 AND HE GOT ANGRY WITH MYESHA AND HE STARTED BEATING HER AND HE PUT HER IN A
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@520.30:530.34 OH HE WOULD USE A BELT HE HAD A BELT BECAUSE HE HAD THIS WARPED PERVERTED THING THAT MYESHA WAS HAVING SEX WITH HER LITTLE BROTHER AND THEY WAS FONDLING EACH OTHER THAT WOULD BE HIS REASON I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT THE PARTICULAR NIGHT
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@532.91:542.19 AND SO HE PUT HER IN THE BATHTUB AND I WAS IN THE BEDROOM WITH THE BABY AND FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THIS HAPPENED FOUR MONTHS BEFORE MYESHA DIED I THOUGHT I COULD REALLY FIX THIS MAN
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@543.03:549.34 SO I HAD A BABY BY HIM INSANE THINKING THAT IF I GAVE HIM HIS OWN KID HE WOULD LEAVE MINE ALONE
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@549.82:550.93 AND IT DIDN'T WORK
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@553.82:558.83 UP WITH THREE CHILDREN HOUSTON MYESHA AND DOMINIC WHO WAS FOUR MONTHS OLD WHEN I CAME TO
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@560.32:565.87 AND I WAS IN THE BEDROOM LIKE I SAID HE HAD HER IN THE BATHROOM AND HE HE EVERY TIME HE HIT HER SHE WOULD FALL
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@574.20:577.03 BUT I DARED NOT TO MOVE I DIDN'T MOVE I DIDN'T EVEN GO AND SEE WHAT WAS
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@578.35:579.60 I JUST SAT THERE AND
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@589.14:591.93 AND SO SHE SET THERE FOR ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE HOURS
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@604.46:607.54 ALL AROUND HER HEAD WAS JUST SWOLLEN HER HEAD WAS ABOUT TWO SIZES OF
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@619.09:620.30 THE NEXT MORNING SHE WAS
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@625.26:627.43 ON HER FOR SCHOOL AND HE GOT VERY EXCITED
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@632.14:636.10 SHE WAS DEAD I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT SHE WAS DEAD SO I
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@638.40:639.93 THERE WAS NO THING NOTHING
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@641.02:646.80 COMING OUT OF HER MOUTH HE SAID HE SAID HE SAID WE CAN 'T WE CAN'T LET NOBODY FIND OUT ABOUT THIS HE SAY YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@647.16:648.06 I AGREE
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@649.77:654.84 I MEAN I'VE BEEN KEEPING A SECRET FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS SO IT JUST SEEMED LIKE SECOND HAND TO ME JUST TO KEEP ON KEEPING IT A SECRET
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@656.77:658.04 SO WE WENT TO THE MALL
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@659.07:661.40 AND WE TOLD A POLICE THAT WE HAD LIKE LOST HER
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@665.29:666.74 WE TOLD A SECURITY GUARD
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@667.95:669.18 THAT SHE WAS MISSING
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@671.03:671.33 SHE
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@712.68:713.02 TO
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@722.57:725.51 SO THAT'S AN INVESTIGATION OF THE NEGATIVE IMAGINATION
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@734.89:741.29 SEARCH FOR AN AMERICAN CHARACTER WITH MY TAPE RECORDER I THOUGHT THAT I WAS GOING TO GO AROUND AMERICA AND FIND IT IN ALL ITS ASPECTS BULL RIDERS
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@742.18:749.27 PIG FARMERS DRUM MAJORETTES BUT I SORT OF GOT TRIPPED ON RACE RELATIONS BECAUSE MY FIRST BIG SHOW WAS A SHOW
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@762.70:774.56 IT'S A KIND OF AN ARIA I WOULD SAY AND IN MANY TAPES THAT I HAVE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THE LOS ANGELES RIOTS HAPPENED BECAUSE FOUR COPS BEAT UP A BLACK MAN NAMED RODNEY KING IT WAS CAPTURED ON VIDEO TAPE TECHNOLOGY
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@775.10:784.94 WAS PLAYED ALL OVER THE WORLD EVERYBODY THOUGHT THE FOUR COPS WOULD GO TO JAIL THEY DID NOT SO THERE WERE RIOTS AND WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGET IS THERE WAS A SECOND TRIAL ORDERED BY GEORGE BUSH SR AND THAT
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@786.89:792.49 CAME BACK WITH TWO COPS GOING TO JAIL AND TWO COPS DECLARED INNOCENT I WAS AT THAT TRIAL
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@803.21:812.09 WHOSE STORES HAD BEEN BURNED TO THE GROUND AND SO THIS WOMAN MISTERS YOUNG SOON HAN I SUPPOSE WILL HAVE TAUGHT ME THE MOST THAT I HAVE LEARNED ABOUT RACE AND SHE
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@821.86:824.97 IN SOCIETY AND THIS IS CALLED SWALLOWING THE BITTERNESS
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@826.70:828.31 I USED TO BELIEVE
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@834.33:834.66 MANY
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@852.60:853.32 BUT AT THE END
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@854.96:860.70 WHEN WE WERE IN SUCH TURMOIL AND HAVING ALL THE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AND ALL THE MENTAL
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@861.47:864.11 I BEGAN TO REALLY REALIZE THAT
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@867.33:874.52 OUT OF THIS SOCIETY AND WE ARE NOTHING WHY WHY DO WE HAVE TO BE
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@889.93:895.51 AMOUNT OF MONEY TO SURVIVE WE DIDN'T GET ANY BECAUSE WE HAVE A
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@900.26:903.41 AND A HOUSE AND WE ARE
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@909.15:909.41 I
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005@918.52:926.22 MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS PROBABLY THINK THAT THEY WON BY THE TRIAL I WAS SITTING HERE WATCHING THEM THE MORNING AFTER THE VERDICT AND ALL THE
