SebastianWernicke_2010A YOU GO ON THE TED WEBSITE YOU CAN CURRENTLY FIND THERE OVER A FULL WEEK OF TED TALK VIDEOS OVER ONE POINT THREE MILLION WORDS OF TRANSCRIPTS AND MILLIONS OF USER RATINGS
SebastianWernicke_2010A AND THAT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF DATA AND IT GOT ME WONDERING IF YOU TOOK ALL THIS DATA AND PUT IT THROUGH STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
SebastianWernicke_2010A ALSO COULD YOU CREATE THE WORST POSSIBLE TED TALK THAT THEY WOULD STILL LET YOU GET AWAY WITH
SebastianWernicke_2010A TO FIND THIS OUT I LOOKED AT THREE THINGS I LOOKED AT THE TOPIC THAT YOU SHOULD CHOOSE I LOOKED AT HOW YOU SHOULD DELIVER IT AND THE VISUALS ONSTAGE
SebastianWernicke_2010A NOW WITH THE TOPIC THERE'S A WHOLE RANGE OF TOPICS YOU CAN CHOOSE BUT YOU SHOULD CHOOSE WISELY BECAUSE YOUR TOPIC STRONGLY CORRELATES WITH HOW USERS WILL REACT TO YOUR TALK
SebastianWernicke_2010A NOW TO MAKE THIS MORE CONCRETE LET 'S LOOK AT THE LIST OF TOP TEN WORDS THAT STATISTICALLY STICK OUT
SebastianWernicke_2010A IN THE MOST FAVORITE TED TALKS
SebastianWernicke_2010A IN THE LEAST FAVORITE TED TALKS SO IF YOU CAME HERE TO TALK ABOUT HOW FRENCH COFFEE WILL SPREAD HAPPINESS IN OUR BRAINS
SebastianWernicke_2010A GO
SebastianWernicke_2010A WELL IF YOU GENERALIZE THIS THE MOST FAVORITE TED TALKS ARE THOSE THAT
SebastianWernicke_2010A FEATURE TOPICS WE CAN CONNECT WITH BOTH EASILY AND DEEPLY SUCH AS HAPPINESS OUR OWN BODY FOOD EMOTIONS
SebastianWernicke_2010A THE MORE TECHNICAL TOPICS SUCH AS ARCHITECTURE MATERIALS AND STRANGELY ENOUGH MEN THOSE ARE NOT GOOD TOPICS TO TALK ABOUT
SebastianWernicke_2010A HOW SHOULD YOU DELIVER YOUR TALK TED IS FAMOUS FOR KEEPING A VERY SHARP EYE ON THE CLOCK SO THEY'RE GOING TO HATE ME FOR REVEALING THIS BECAUSE ACTUALLY YOU SHOULD TALK AS LONG AS THEY WILL LET
SebastianWernicke_2010A ALL RANKING LISTS ON TED COM EXCEPT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A TALK THAT'S BEAUTIFUL INSPIRING OR FUNNY THEN YOU SHOULD BE BRIEF BUT
SebastianWernicke_2010A OTHER THAN THAT TALK UNTIL THEY DRAG YOU OFF THE STAGE
SebastianWernicke_2010A PUSHING THE CLOCK THERE'S A FEW RULES TO OBEY I FOUND THESE RULES OUT BY COMPARING THE STATISTICS OF FOUR WORD PHRASES THAT APPEAR MORE OFTEN IN THE MOST
SebastianWernicke_2010A AND
SebastianWernicke_2010A NOW LET 'S GO TO THE VISUALS THE MOST OBVIOUS VISUAL THING ON STAGE IS THE SPEAKER AND ANALYSIS SHOWS IF YOU WANT TO BE AMONG THE MOST FAVORITE TED SPEAKERS YOU SHOULD
SebastianWernicke_2010A LET YOUR HAIR GROW A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN AVERAGE MAKE SURE YOU WEAR YOUR GLASSES AND BE SLIGHTLY MORE DRESSED UP THAN THE AVERAGE TED SPEAKER
SebastianWernicke_2010A THE RATINGS THAT TALKS GET ON THE WEBSITE FOR EXAMPLE FASCINATING TALKS CONTAIN A STATISTICALLY HIGH AMOUNT OF
SebastianWernicke_2010A I'M NOT THE FIRST ONE WHO HAS DONE THIS ANALYSIS BUT I'LL LEAVE THIS TO YOUR GOOD JUDGMENT SO NOW IT'S TIME TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER AND
SebastianWernicke_2010A GIVE YOU SOMETHING I WILL NOT IMPOSE THE ULTIMATE OR WORST TED TALK ON YOU BUT RATHER GIVE YOU A TOOL TO CREATE YOUR OWN AND I CALL THIS TOOL THE TED PAD AND
SebastianWernicke_2010A TED PAD IS A MATRIX OF ONE HUNDRED SPECIFICALLY SELECTED HIGHLY CURATED SENTENCES THAT YOU CAN EASILY PIECE TOGETHER TO GET YOUR OWN TED TALK
SebastianWernicke_2010A YOU ONLY HAVE TO MAKE ONE DECISION AND THAT IS ARE YOU GOING TO USE THE WHITE VERSION FOR VERY GOOD TED TALKS ABOUT
