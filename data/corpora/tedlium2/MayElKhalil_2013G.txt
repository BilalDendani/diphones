MayElKhalil_2013G@24.52:37.99 YOU KNOW LEBANON AS A COUNTRY HAS BEEN ONCE DESTROYED BY A LONG AND BLOODY CIVIL WAR HONESTLY I DON 'T KNOW WHY THEY CALL IT CIVIL WAR WHEN THERE IS NOTHING CIVIL ABOUT IT
MayElKhalil_2013G@37.99:50.21 WITH SYRIA TO THE NORTH ISRAEL AND PALESTINE TO THE SOUTH AND OUR GOVERNMENT EVEN UP TILL THIS MOMENT IS STILL FRAGMENTED AND UNSTABLE
MayElKhalil_2013G@50.21:56.27 FOR YEARS THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN DIVIDED BETWEEN POLITICS AND RELIGION
MayElKhalil_2013G@56.27:58.16 HOWEVER
MayElKhalil_2013G@84.81:90.2 UNTIL ONE FATEFUL MORNING AND WHILE TRAINING
MayElKhalil_2013G@90.2:94.03 I WAS HIT BY A BUS
MayElKhalil_2013G@94.35:95.88 I NEARLY DIED
MayElKhalil_2013G@107.06:121.85 AS SOON AS I CAME OUT OF MY COMA I REALIZED THAT I WAS NO LONGER THE SAME RUNNER I USED TO BE SO I DECIDED IF I COULDN 'T RUN MYSELF I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
MayElKhalil_2013G@122.01:134.45 THAT OTHERS COULD SO OUT OF MY HOSPITAL BED I ASKED MY HUSBAND TO START TAKING NOTES AND A FEW MONTHS LATER THE MARATHON WAS BORN
MayElKhalil_2013G@142.37:154.69 BUT AT THAT TIME EVEN DURING MY MOST VULNERABLE CONDITION I NEEDED TO DREAM BIG I NEEDED SOMETHING TO TAKE ME OUT OF MY PAIN AN OBJECTIVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO
MayElKhalil_2013G@155.57:157.97 I DIDN 'T WANT TO PITY MYSELF
MayElKhalil_2013G@157.98:159.91 NOR TO BE PITIED
MayElKhalil_2013G@159.91:168.46 AND I THOUGHT BY ORGANIZING SUCH A MARATHON I 'LL BE ABLE TO PAY BACK TO MY COMMUNITY BUILD BRIDGES WITH THE OUTSIDE
MayElKhalil_2013G@184.62:200.75 HOW DO YOU INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF RUNNING TO A NATION THAT IS CONSTANTLY AT THE BRINK OF WAR HOW DO YOU ASK THOSE WHO WERE ONCE FIGHTING AND KILLING EACH OTHER TO COME TOGETHER AND RUN NEXT TO EACH OTHER
MayElKhalil_2013G@200.75:212.81 MORE THAN THAT HOW DO YOU CONVINCE PEOPLE TO RUN A DISTANCE OF TWENTY SIX POINT TWO MILES AT A TIME THEY WERE NOT EVEN FAMILIAR WITH THE WORD MARATHON
MayElKhalil_2013G@213.28:216.48 SO WE HAD TO START FROM SCRATCH FOR
MayElKhalil_2013G@233.77:237 PEOPLE FROM MOSQUES CHURCHES
MayElKhalil_2013G@252.61:269.99 AND THEY SHARED THEIR STORIES IN RETURN IT WAS HONESTY AND TRANSPARENCY THAT BROUGHT US TOGETHER WE SPOKE ONE COMMON LANGUAGE TO EACH OTHER AND THAT WAS FROM ONE HUMAN TO ANOTHER
MayElKhalil_2013G@269.99:282.83 ONCE THAT TRUST WAS BUILT EVERYBODY WANTED TO BE PART OF THE MARATHON TO SHOW THE WORLD THE TRUE COLORS OF LEBANON AND THE LEBANESE AND THEIR DESIRE TO LIVE IN PEACE
MayElKhalil_2013G@295.09:299.15 ALL DETERMINED AND WHEN THE GUNFIRE WENT OFF
MayElKhalil_2013G@308.64:319.59 SO DID OUR POLITICAL PROBLEMS BUT FOR EVERY DISASTER WE HAD THE MARATHON FOUND WAYS TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER
MayElKhalil_2013G@319.59:329.19 IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE OUR PRIME MINISTER WAS ASSASSINATED AND THE COUNTRY CAME TO A COMPLETE STANDSTILL
MayElKhalil_2013G@329.19:339.63 SO WE ORGANIZED A FIVE KILOMETER UNITED WE RUN CAMPAIGN OVER SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE CAME TO THE START LINE ALL WEARING WHITE T SHIRTS
MayElKhalil_2013G@339.63:343.09 WITH NO POLITICAL SLOGANS
MayElKhalil_2013G@343.23:352.81 THAT WAS A TURNING POINT FOR THE MARATHON WHERE PEOPLE STARTED LOOKING AT IT AS A PLATFORM FOR PEACE AND UNITY
MayElKhalil_2013G@352.81:371.83 BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX UP TO TWO THOUSAND AND NINE OUR COUNTRY LEBANON WENT THROUGH UNSTABLE YEARS INVASIONS AND MORE ASSASSINATIONS THAT BROUGHT US CLOSE TO A CIVIL WAR THE COUNTRY WAS DIVIDED AGAIN SO MUCH THAT OUR PARLIAMENT RESIGNED
MayElKhalil_2013G@372.05:381.88 WE HAD NO PRESIDENT FOR A YEAR AND NO PRIME MINISTER BUT WE DID HAVE A MARATHON
MayElKhalil_2013G@388.33:392.51 WE LEARNED THAT POLITICAL PROBLEMS CAN BE
MayElKhalil_2013G@392.51:402.47 OVERCOME WHEN THE OPPOSITION PARTY DECIDED TO SHUT DOWN PART OF THE CITY CENTER WE NEGOTIATED ALTERNATIVE ROUTES
MayElKhalil_2013G@402.47:409.21 GOVERNMENT PROTESTERS BECAME SIDELINE CHEERLEADERS THEY EVEN HOSTED JUICE STATIONS
MayElKhalil_2013G@409.21:416.54 YOU KNOW THE MARATHON HAS REALLY BECOME ONE OF
MayElKhalil_2013G@416.54:430.81 KIND IT GAINED CREDIBILITY FROM BOTH THE LEBANESE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY LAST NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE OVER THIRTY THREE THOUSAND RUNNERS FROM EIGHTY FIVE DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES
MayElKhalil_2013G@461.58:469.07 THEMES HAVE INCLUDED RUNS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BREAST CANCER FOR THE LOVE OF LEBANON FOR PEACE
MayElKhalil_2013G@469.07:471.17 OR JUST SIMPLY TO RUN

MayElKhalil_2013G@549.63:559.09 WE ARE NOW ONE OF THE LARGEST RUNNING EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT IS A PLATFORM FOR HOPE
MayElKhalil_2013G@579.74:584.59 FROM NATIONAL MARATHONS OR FROM NATIONAL EVENTS TO SMALLER
MayElKhalil_2013G@584.59:588.98 REGIONAL RACES WE 'VE SEEN THAT PEOPLE WANT TO RUN
MayElKhalil_2013G@588.98:592.73 FOR A BETTER FUTURE AFTER ALL
MayElKhalil_2013G@593.21:601.1 PEACEMAKING IS NOT A SPRINT IT IS MORE OF A MARATHON THANK YOU
