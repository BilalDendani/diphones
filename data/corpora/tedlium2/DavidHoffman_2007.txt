DavidHoffman_2007@19.47:24.39 YEARS AGO IN THE OLD SOVIET UNION A TEAM OF ENGINEERS WAS SECRETLY MOVING A LARGE
DavidHoffman_2007@35.51:40.06 AND PACKED IN ITS NOSE WAS A SILVER BALL WITH TWO RADIOS INSIDE
DavidHoffman_2007@48.08:49.90 WE ARE ABOUT TO CREATE A NEW
DavidHoffman_2007@50.76:52.24 THAT WE WILL CALL SPUTNIK
DavidHoffman_2007@53.16:58.54 IN THE OLDEN DAYS EXPLORERS LIKE VASCO DA GAMA AND COLUMBUS HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE
DavidHoffman_2007@58.80:68.80 TO OPEN UP THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE NOW WE HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE TO OPEN UP SPACE AND IT IS FOR THOSE IN THE FUTURE TO ENVY US OUR JOY
DavidHoffman_2007@80.18:90.38 AS A RESULT FOR DAYS AFTER THE LAUNCH SPUTNIK WAS A WONDERFUL CURIOSITY A MAN MADE MOON VISIBLE BY ORDINARY CITIZENS
DavidHoffman_2007@104.58:117.47 WE BELIEVED THAT SPUTNIK WAS PROOF THAT OUR ENEMY HAD BEATEN US IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND THAT THEY COULD NOW ATTACK US WITH HYDROGEN BOMBS USING THEIR SPUTNIK ROCKET AS AN IBM MISSILE
DavidHoffman_2007@118.50:128.13 ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE SPUTNIK QUICKLY BECAME ONE OF THE THREE GREAT SHOCKS TO HIT AMERICA HISTORIANS SAY THE EQUAL OF PEARL HARBOR OR NINE ELEVEN
DavidHoffman_2007@129.27:134.11 IT PROVOKED THE MISSILE GAP IT EXPLODED AN ARMS RACE
DavidHoffman_2007@156.90:168.48 IN SEVENTY EIGHT CITIES WENT UNDERGROUND OR THE GALLUP POLL THAT SHOWED THAT SEVEN IN TEN AMERICANS BELIEVED THAT A NUCLEAR WAR WOULD HAPPEN AND THAT AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION WAS GOING TO BE KILLED
DavidHoffman_2007@169.82:172.32 BUT SPUTNIK PROVOKED WONDERFUL CHANGES AS WELL
DavidHoffman_2007@173.16:177.02 FOR EXAMPLE SOME IN THIS ROOM WENT TO SCHOOL ON SCHOLARSHIP BECAUSE OF SPUTNIK
DavidHoffman_2007@177.93:182.79 SUPPORT FOR ENGINEERING MATH AND SCIENCE EDUCATION IN GENERAL BOOMED
DavidHoffman_2007@183.66:189.32 AND VINT CERF POINTS OUT THAT SPUTNIK LED DIRECTLY TO ARPA AND THE INTERNET AND OF COURSE NASA
DavidHoffman_2007@190.40:196.46 MY FEATURE DOCUMENTARY SHOWS HOW A FREE SOCIETY CAN BE STAMPEDED BY THOSE WHO KNOW HOW TO USE MEDIA
DavidHoffman_2007@205.84:207.19 SPUTNIK WILL SOON BE RELEASED
DavidHoffman_2007@208.02:215.65 IN CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK ONE OF MY INVESTORS LONGTIME TEDSTER JAY WALKER AND I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL
