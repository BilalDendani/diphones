GaryWolf_2010S I GOT UP THIS MORNING AT SIX TEN AM AFTER GOING TO SLEEP AT TWELVE FORTY FIVE AM I WAS AWAKENED ONCE DURING THE NIGHT
GaryWolf_2010S ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLIGRAMS OF CAFFEINE ZERO OF ALCOHOL AND MY SCORE ON THE NARCISSISM PERSONALITY INDEX OR THE NPI SIXTEEN IS
GaryWolf_2010S A REASSURING ZERO POINT THREE ONE WE KNOW THAT NUMBERS ARE USEFUL FOR US WHEN WE ADVERTISE MANAGE GOVERN SEARCH I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW THEY'RE USEFUL WHEN WE REFLECT LEARN REMEMBER
GaryWolf_2010S AND WANT TO IMPROVE A FEW YEAR AGO KEVIN KELLY MY PARTNER AND I NOTICED THAT PEOPLE WERE SUBJECTING THEMSELVES TO REGIMES OF QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT AND SELF TRACKING THAT WENT FAR BEYOND THE ORDINARY FAMILIAR HABITS SUCH AS STEPPING ON A SCALE EVERY DAY
GaryWolf_2010S PEOPLE WERE TRACKING THEIR FOOD VIA TWITTER THEIR KIDS DIAPERS ON THEIR IPHONE THEY WERE MAKING DETAILED JOURNALS OF THEIR SPENDING THEIR MOOD THEIR SYMPTOMS THEIR TREATMENTS
GaryWolf_2010S NOW WE KNOW SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL FACTS THAT ARE DRIVING THIS CHANGE IN OUR LIFESTYLE THE UPTAKE AND DIFFUSION OF MOBILE DEVICES THE EXPONENTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN DATA STORAGE AND DATA PROCESSING
GaryWolf_2010S THE INCREDIBLE DETAILED INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN GET FROM JUST ONE SENSOR LIKE THIS THIS KIND OF SENSOR IS IN THE
GaryWolf_2010S HAS JUST THAT SENSOR IN IT YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE NIKE PLUS SYSTEM I JUST PUT IT UP BECAUSE THAT LITTLE BLUE DOT IS THE SENSOR
GaryWolf_2010S STRAP THAT PEOPLE USE TO TRANSMIT HEART RATE DATA TO THEIR NIKE PLUS SYSTEM THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL NEW
GaryWolf_2010S THE SENSOR IS JUST A LITTLE STRIP OF METAL IN THAT HEADBAND THERE THE REST OF IT IS THE BEDSIDE CONSOLE JUST FOR REFERENCE THIS IS A SLEEP TRACKING SYSTEM FROM JUST A FEW YEARS AGO I MEAN REALLY
GaryWolf_2010S IS A VERY SMALL GPS TRANSCEIVER WHICH GIVES YOU THE DATE AND LOCATION OF AN ASTHMA INCIDENT GIVING YOU A NEW AWARENESS OF YOUR VULNERABILITY IN RELATION TO TIME AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
GaryWolf_2010S NOW WE KNOW THAT NEW TOOLS ARE CHANGING OUR SENSE OF SELF IN THE WORLD THESE TINY SENSORS THAT GATHER DATA IN NATURE
GaryWolf_2010S THE UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING THAT ALLOWS THAT DATA TO BE UNDERSTOOD AND USED AND OF COURSE THE SOCIAL NETWORKS THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO COLLABORATE AND CONTRIBUTE
GaryWolf_2010S BUT WE THINK OF THESE TOOLS AS POINTING OUTWARD AS WINDOWS AND I'D JUST LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO THINK OF THEM AS ALSO TURNING INWARD
GaryWolf_2010S AND BECOMING MIRRORS SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT USING THEM TO GET SOME SYSTEMATIC IMPROVEMENT WE ALSO THINK ABOUT HOW THEY CAN BE USEFUL FOR SELF IMPROVEMENT FOR SELF DISCOVERY SELF AWARENESS SELF KNOWLEDGE
GaryWolf_2010S HERE 'S A BIOMETRIC DEVICE A PAIR OF APPLE EARBUDS LAST YEAR APPLE FILED SOME PATENTS TO GET BLOOD OXYGENATION HEART RATE AND BODY TEMPERATURE VIA THE EARBUDS
GaryWolf_2010S TELL YOU THAT IT'S ALSO FOR SELF KNOWLEDGE AND THE SELF ISN'T THE ONLY THING IT'S NOT EVEN MOST THINGS THE SELF IS JUST OUR OPERATION CENTER
GaryWolf_2010S OUR CONSCIOUSNESS OUR MORAL COMPASS SO IF WE WANT TO ACT MORE EFFECTIVELY IN THE WORLD WE HAVE TO GET TO KNOW OURSELVES BETTER THANK YOU
