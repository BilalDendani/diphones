ChrisAbani_2008 LOOK AWAY FROM THE DARKEST THINGS ABOUT US BECAUSE
ChrisAbani_2008 I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE'RE NEVER MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN WE'RE MOST UGLY BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY THE MOMENT WE REALLY KNOW WHAT WE'RE MADE OF
ChrisAbani_2008 CHRIS SAID I GREW UP IN NIGERIA WITH A WHOLE GENERATION IN THE EIGHTIES OF STUDENTS WHO WERE PROTESTING A MILITARY DICTATORSHIP WHICH HAS FINALLY ENDED SO IT WASN'T JUST ME THERE WAS A WHOLE GENERATION OF US
ChrisAbani_2008 BUT WHAT I'VE COME TO LEARN
ChrisAbani_2008 IS THAT THE WORLD IS NEVER SAVED IN GRAND MESSIANIC GESTURES BUT IN THE SIMPLE
ChrisAbani_2008 IN SOUTH AFRICA THEY HAVE A PHRASE CALLED
ChrisAbani_2008 ONLY WAY FOR ME TO BE HUMAN IS FOR YOU TO REFLECT MY HUMANITY BACK AT ME BUT IF YOU'RE LIKE ME MY HUMANITY IS MORE LIKE A WINDOW I DON'T REALLY SEE IT I DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO IT UNTIL
ChrisAbani_2008 LIKE A BUG THAT'S DEAD ON THE WINDOW THEN SUDDENLY I SEE IT AND USUALLY IT'S NEVER GOOD IT'S USUALLY WHEN I'M CUSSING IN TRAFFIC
ChrisAbani_2008 SOMEONE WHO IS TRYING TO DRIVE THEIR CAR AND DRINK COFFEE AND SEND EMAILS AND MAKE NOTES SO
ChrisAbani_2008 WHAT UBUNTU REALLY SAYS IS THAT THERE IS NO WAY FOR US TO BE HUMAN WITHOUT OTHER PEOPLE
ChrisAbani_2008 VERY COMPLICATED SO I THOUGHT I SHOULD
ChrisAbani_2008 SOME STORIES I SHOULD TELL YOU SOME STORIES ABOUT REMARKABLE PEOPLE SO I THOUGHT I'D START WITH MY MOTHER
ChrisAbani_2008 AND SHE WAS DARK
ChrisAbani_2008 MY MOTHER WAS ENGLISH MY PARENTS MET IN OXFORD IN THE FIFTIES AND MY MOTHER MOVED TO NIGERIA AND
ChrisAbani_2008 SHE WAS FIVE FOOT TWO VERY FEISTY AND VERY ENGLISH
ChrisAbani_2008 THIS IS HOW ENGLISH MY MOTHER IS OR WAS SHE JUST PASSED SHE CAME OUT TO CALIFORNIA TO LOS ANGELES TO VISIT ME AND WE WENT TO MALIBU WHICH SHE THOUGHT WAS VERY
ChrisAbani_2008 AND THEN WE WENT TO A FISH RESTAURANT
ChrisAbani_2008 AND WE HAD CHAD THE SURFER DUDE SERVING US AND HE CAME UP AND MY MOTHER SAID DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIALS
ChrisAbani_2008 MY MOTHER TURNED TO ME AND SAID WHAT
ChrisAbani_2008 I SAID ENGLISH MUM AND SHE SHOOK HER HEAD AND SAID
ChrisAbani_2008 SO THIS WOMAN
ChrisAbani_2008 WHO CONVERTED FROM THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND TO CATHOLICISM WHEN SHE MARRIED MY FATHER
ChrisAbani_2008 AND THERE'S NO ONE MORE RABID THAN A CATHOLIC CONVERT
ChrisAbani_2008 DECIDED TO TEACH IN THE RURAL AREAS IN NIGERIA PARTICULARLY AMONG IGBO WOMEN THE BILLINGS OVULATION METHOD
ChrisAbani_2008 WHICH WAS THE ONLY APPROVED BIRTH CONTROL BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
ChrisAbani_2008 WASN'T TOO GOOD
ChrisAbani_2008 SO SHE TOOK ME ALONG TO TRANSLATE
ChrisAbani_2008 NEVER DISCUSS THEIR PERIOD WITH THEIR HUSBANDS
ChrisAbani_2008 HOW SWOLLEN IS YOUR VULVA
ChrisAbani_2008 SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF HERSELF AS A FEMINIST MY MOTHER
ChrisAbani_2008 BUT SHE ALWAYS USED TO SAY ANYTHING A MAN CAN DO I CAN FIX
ChrisAbani_2008 AND
ChrisAbani_2008 WHEN MY FATHER COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS SITUATION WHERE SHE'S TAKING A SEVEN YEAR OLD BOY TO TEACH THIS BIRTH CONTROL YOU KNOW HE USED TO SAY OH YOU'RE TURNING HIM INTO YOU'RE TEACHING HIM HOW TO BE A WOMAN MY MOTHER SAID SOMEONE HAS
ChrisAbani_2008 THIS WOMAN DURING THE BIAFRAN WAR
ChrisAbani_2008 WE WERE CAUGHT IN THE WAR IT WAS MY MOTHER WITH FIVE LITTLE CHILDREN
ChrisAbani_2008 IT TAKES HER ONE YEAR THROUGH REFUGEE CAMP AFTER REFUGEE CAMP TO MAKE HER WAY TO AN AIRSTRIP WHERE WE CAN FLY OUT OF THE COUNTRY
ChrisAbani_2008 AT EVERY SINGLE REFUGEE CAMP SHE HAS TO FACE OFF SOLDIERS WHO WANT TO TAKE MY ELDER BROTHER MARK WHO WAS NINE AND MAKE HIM A BOY SOLDIER CAN YOU IMAGINE THIS FIVE FOOT TWO WOMAN STANDING UP TO MEN WITH GUNS WHO WANT TO KILL US
ChrisAbani_2008 ALL THROUGH THAT ONE YEAR MY MOTHER NEVER CRIED ONE TIME NOT
ChrisAbani_2008 BUT WHEN WE WERE IN LISBON IN THE AIRPORT ABOUT TO FLY TO ENGLAND
ChrisAbani_2008 IT WAS BASICALLY SEE THROUGH WITH FIVE REALLY HUNGRY LOOKING KIDS CAME OVER AND ASKED HER WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND SHE TOLD THIS WOMAN AND SO THIS WOMAN EMPTIED OUT HER SUITCASE AND
ChrisAbani_2008 ALL OF HER CLOTHES TO MY MOTHER AND TO US AND THE TOYS OF HER KIDS WHO DIDN'T LIKE THAT VERY MUCH
ChrisAbani_2008 ANY KIND OF HORROR BUT THE SIMPLE ACT OF KINDNESS FROM A COMPLETE STRANGER WILL UNSTITCH YOU
ChrisAbani_2008 THE OLD WOMEN IN MY FATHER 'S VILLAGE AFTER THIS WAR
ChrisAbani_2008 AND THEY WOULD SING THESE DIRGES MADE UP OF THESE NAMES DIRGES SO MELANCHOLIC THAT THEY WOULD SCORCH YOU
ChrisAbani_2008 AND THEY WOULD SING THEM ONLY WHEN THEY PLANTED THE
ChrisAbani_2008 AS THOUGH THEY WERE SEEDING THE HEARTS OF THE DEAD
ChrisAbani_2008 BUT WHEN IT CAME FOR HARVEST TIME THEY WOULD SING THESE JOYFUL SONGS THAT WERE MADE UP OF THE NAMES OF EVERY CHILD WHO HAD BEEN BORN THAT
ChrisAbani_2008 THESE WOMEN ENACTED
ChrisAbani_2008 A LOT OF TRANSFORMATION
ChrisAbani_2008 AND THE WORD FOR MARRIAGE WAS THE SAME ONE
ChrisAbani_2008 REBUILDING RWANDA
ChrisAbani_2008 DID YOU ALSO KNOW THAT AFTER APARTHEID WHEN THE NEW GOVERNMENT WENT INTO THE PARLIAMENT HOUSES
ChrisAbani_2008 WHICH WOULD SEEM TO SUGGEST THAT APARTHEID WAS ENTIRELY THE BUSINESS OF MEN
ChrisAbani_2008 ALL OF THIS TO SAY
ChrisAbani_2008 NEVER REALLY COUNTED
ChrisAbani_2008 ALWAYS RITES OF PASSAGE FOR YOUNG MEN
ChrisAbani_2008 MEN WERE TAUGHT TO BE MEN IN THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ARE NOT WOMEN THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT IS AND A LOT OF RITUALS INVOLVED KILLING
ChrisAbani_2008 LITTLE ANIMALS PROGRESSING ALONG SO WHEN I TURNED THIRTEEN AND I MEAN IT MADE SENSE IT WAS
ChrisAbani_2008 AGRARIAN COMMUNITY SOMEBODY HAD TO KILL THE ANIMALS THERE WAS NO WHOLE FOODS YOU COULD GO AND GET KANGAROO STEAK AT SO WHEN I TURNED THIRTEEN IT WAS MY TURN NOW TO KILL A GOAT
ChrisAbani_2008 THIS WEIRD SENSITIVE KID WHO COULDN'T REALLY DO IT
ChrisAbani_2008 BUT I HAD TO DO IT AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO THIS ALONE BUT A FRIEND OF MINE CALLED EMMANUEL WHO WAS SIGNIFICANTLY OLDER THAN ME WHO 'D BEEN A BOY SOLDIER DURING THE BIAFRAN WAR DECIDED TO COME WITH ME
ChrisAbani_2008 WHICH SORT OF
ChrisAbani_2008 MADE ME FEEL GOOD BECAUSE HE'D SEEN A LOT OF THINGS NOW WHEN I WAS GROWING UP HE USED TO TELL ME STORIES ABOUT HOW HE USED TO BAYONET PEOPLE AND THEIR INTESTINES WOULD FALL OUT BUT THEY WOULD KEEP RUNNING
ChrisAbani_2008 SO THIS GUY COMES WITH ME AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER HEARD A GOAT OR SEEN ONE
ChrisAbani_2008 THEY SOUND LIKE HUMAN BEINGS
ChrisAbani_2008 MY FRIEND BRAD KESSLER SAYS
ChrisAbani_2008 WE DIDN'T BECOME HUMAN UNTIL WE STARTED KEEPING GOATS
ChrisAbani_2008 A GOAT 'S EYES ARE LIKE A CHILD
ChrisAbani_2008 PUTS HIS HAND OVER THE MOUTH OF THE GOAT COVERS
ChrisAbani_2008 THIS GUY WHO 'D SEEN SO MUCH AND WHO TO WHOM THE KILLING OF A GOAT MUST HAVE SEEMED SUCH A QUOTIDIAN EXPERIENCE
ChrisAbani_2008 STILL FOUND IT IN HIMSELF TO TRY TO PROTECT ME
ChrisAbani_2008 I WAS A WIMP I CRIED FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND AFTERWARDS HE DIDN'T SAY A WORD HE JUST SAT THERE WATCHING ME CRY FOR AN HOUR AND THEN AFTERWARDS HE SAID TO ME
ChrisAbani_2008 IT WILL ALWAYS BE DIFFICULT
ChrisAbani_2008 BUT IF YOU CRY LIKE THIS EVERY TIME YOU WILL DIE OF
ChrisAbani_2008 JUST KNOW THAT IT IS ENOUGH SOMETIMES TO KNOW THAT IT IS DIFFICULT

ChrisAbani_2008 THAT THEY BUILT THEIR OWN GODS
ChrisAbani_2008 COME TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY
ChrisAbani_2008 AND THEIR WISH WOULD THEN BE BROUGHT TO A PRIEST WHO WOULD FIND A RITUAL OBJECT AND THE APPROPRIATE SACRIFICES WOULD BE MADE
ChrisAbani_2008 BECAME UNRULY AND BEGAN TO ASK FOR HUMAN SACRIFICE
ChrisAbani_2008 DESTROY THE GOD
ChrisAbani_2008 THEY WOULD KNOCK DOWN THE SHRINE
ChrisAbani_2008 WE'RE BUILDING GODS THAT HAVE GONE RAMPANT
ChrisAbani_2008 TIME WE STARTED KNOCKING THEM
ChrisAbani_2008 THEIR NAMES
