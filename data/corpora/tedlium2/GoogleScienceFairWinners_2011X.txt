GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X A
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X GOING TO A RESTAURANT AND WANTED A HEALTHIER OPTION WHICH WOULD YOU CHOOSE GRILLED OR FRIED CHICKEN NOW MOST PEOPLE WOULD ANSWER GRILLED AND IT 'S TRUE THAT GRILLED CHICKEN DOES CONTAIN LESS FAT AND FEWER CALORIES HOWEVER GRILLED CHICKEN POSES A HIDDEN DANGER
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X THEY ARE ALSO ORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN WHICH ONE OR MORE OF THE HYDROGENS IN AMMONIA IS REPLACED WITH A MORE COMPLEX GROUP
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X THESE HERE ARE FIVE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT CLASSIFY CARCINOGENS
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X BETWEEN THE PHYSICIAN 'S COMMITTEE FOR RESPONSIBLE MEDICINE AND SEVEN DIFFERENT FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X THEY WEREN 'T SUED BECAUSE THERE WAS CARCINOGENS IN THE CHICKEN BUT THEY WERE SUED BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA 'S PROPOSITION SIXTY FIVE WHICH STATED THAT IF THERE 'S ANYTHING DANGEROUS IN THE PRODUCTS THEN THE COMPANIES HAD TO GIVE A CLEAR WARNING
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X SO MY IDEA WAS BORN AND I HAD THE PROJECT SET UP AND A HYPOTHESIS SO WHAT WAS MY NEXT STEP
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X WELL OBVIOUSLY I HAD TO FIND A LAB TO WORK AT BECAUSE I DIDN 'T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT IN MY SCHOOL I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE EASY BUT I EMAILED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT PEOPLE WITHIN A FIVE HOUR RADIUS OF WHERE I LIVED AND I GOT ONE POSITIVE RESPONSE THAT SAID THAT THEY COULD WORK WITH ME MOST OF THE OTHERS EITHER NEVER RESPONDED BACK
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X THE SECOND STAGE WAS COMPLETED AT THE PENN STATE UNIVERSITY MAIN CAMPUS LAB WHICH IS WHERE I EXTRACTED THE CHEMICALS CHANGED THE PH SO I COULD RUN IT THROUGH THE EQUIPMENT AND SEPARATED THE COMPOUNDS I NEEDED FROM THE REST OF THE CHICKEN
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X THE FINAL STAGES WHEN I RAN THE SAMPLES THROUGH A HIGH PRESSURE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY MASS SPECTROMETER WHICH SEPARATED THE COMPOUNDS AND ANALYZED THE CHEMICALS AND TOLD ME EXACTLY HOW MUCH CARCINOGENS I HAD IN MY CHICKEN
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X SO WHEN I WENT THROUGH THE DATA I HAD VERY SURPRISING RESULTS BECAUSE I FOUND THAT FOUR OUT OF THE FIVE MARINATING INGREDIENTS ACTUALLY INHIBITED THE CARCINOGEN FORMATION WHEN COMPARED WITH THE UNMARINATED CHICKEN WHICH IS WHAT I USED AS MY CONTROL I FOUND THAT LEMON JUICE WORKED BY FAR THE BEST WHICH DECREASED THE CARCINOGENS BY ABOUT NINETY EIGHT PERCENT
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X AND THE SOY SAUCE RESULTS WERE INCONCLUSIVE BECAUSE OF THE LARGE DATA RANGE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE SOY SAUCE ACTUALLY INCREASED THE POTENTIAL CARCINOGENS ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT I DIDN 'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT INITIALLY WAS THE TIME COOKED AND I FOUND THAT IF YOU INCREASE THE TIME COOKED
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X NOT UNDER COOK BUT DEFINITELY DON 'T OVER COOK AND CHAR THE CHICKEN AND MARINATE IN EITHER LEMON JUICE BROWN SUGAR OR SALTWATER
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X I WANT ALL OF YOU TO IMAGINE A LITTLE GIRL HOLDING A DEAD BLUE SPINACH PLANT AND SHE 'S STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU AND SHE 'S EXPLAINING TO YOU THAT LITTLE KIDS WILL EAT THEIR VEGETABLES IF THEY 'RE DIFFERENT COLORS
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X IT GOT A BIT MORE COMPLICATED
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X FROM THERE MY OLDER BROTHER PANAKI BOSE SPENT HOURS OF HIS TIME EXPLAINING ATOMS TO ME WHEN I BARELY UNDERSTOOD BASIC ALGEBRA
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X MY PARENTS SUFFERED THROUGH MANY MORE OF MY SCIENCE FAIR PROJECTS INCLUDING A REMOTE CONTROLLED GARBAGE CAN
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X SO ARMED WITH ALL THE WISDOM OF FRESHMAN YEAR BIOLOGY
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X I DECIDED I WANTED TO DO CANCER RESEARCH AT FIFTEEN GOOD PLAN SO I STARTED EMAILING
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X ALL OF THESE PROFESSORS IN MY AREA ASKING TO WORK UNDER THEIR SUPERVISION IN A LAB GOT REJECTED BY ALL EXCEPT ONE AND THEN WENT ON MY NEXT SUMMER TO WORK UNDER DR
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X ONE IN ONE HUNDRED WILL DIE FROM IT
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X CHEMOTHERAPY ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS USED TO TREAT CANCER TODAY INVOLVES GIVING PATIENTS REALLY HIGH DOSES OF CHEMICALS TO TRY AND KILL OFF CANCER CELLS
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X SO WE WANTED TO FIGURE OUT HOW THESE OVARIAN CANCER CELLS ARE BECOMING RESISTANT TO THIS DRUG CALLED CISPLATIN AND WE WANTED TO FIGURE THIS OUT BECAUSE IF WE COULD FIGURE THAT OUT THEN WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PREVENT THAT RESISTANCE FROM EVER HAPPENING
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X SO THAT 'S WHAT WE SET OUT TO DO AND WE THOUGHT IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS PROTEIN CALLED AMP KINASE AN ENERGY PROTEIN
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X SO WE RAN ALL OF THESE TESTS BLOCKING THE PROTEIN AND WE SAW THIS HUGE SHIFT I MEAN ON THE SLIDE YOU CAN SEE THAT ON OUR SENSITIVE SIDE THESE CELLS THAT ARE RESPONDING TO THE DRUG WHEN WE START BLOCKING THE PROTEIN
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X THE NUMBER OF DYING CELLS THOSE COLORED DOTS THEY 'RE GOING DOWN
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X BUT THEN ON THIS SIDE WITH THE SAME TREATMENT
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X THOSE ARE DOTS ON A SCREEN FOR YOU WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN WELL BASICALLY THAT MEANS THAT THIS PROTEIN IS CHANGING FROM THE SENSITIVE CELL TO THE RESISTANT CELL AND IN FACT IT MIGHT BE CHANGING THE CELLS THEMSELVES TO MAKE THE CELLS RESISTANT
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X IN FACT IT MEANS THAT IF A PATIENT COMES IN AND THEY 'RE RESISTANT TO THIS DRUG THEN IF WE GIVE THEM A CHEMICAL TO BLOCK THIS PROTEIN THEN WE CAN TREAT THEM AGAIN WITH THE SAME DRUG AND THAT 'S HUGE FOR CHEMOTHERAPY EFFECTIVENESS POSSIBLY FOR MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF CANCER
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X JUST ABOUT THE RESEARCH IT WAS ABOUT FINDING MY PASSION AND IT WAS ABOUT MAKING MY OWN OPPORTUNITIES WHEN I DIDN 'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING IT WAS ABOUT INSPIRATION AND DETERMINATION
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X AND NEVER GIVING UP ON MY INTEREST FOR SCIENCE AND LEARNING AND GROWING AFTER ALL MY STORY BEGINS WITH A DRIED WITHERED SPINACH PLANT AND IT 'S ONLY GETTING BETTER FROM THERE
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X ONE POINT SIX MILLION DEATHS WORLDWIDE ONE DEATH EVERY TWENTY SECONDS
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X PEOPLE SPEND OVER NINETY PERCENT OF THEIR LIVES INDOORS AND THE ECONOMIC BURDEN OF ASTHMA EXCEEDS THAT OF HIV AND TUBERCULOSIS COMBINED NOW THESE STATISTICS HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON ME BUT WHAT REALLY SPARKED MY INTEREST IN MY RESEARCH WAS WATCHING BOTH MY DAD AND MY BROTHER SUFFER FROM CHRONIC ALLERGIES YEAR ROUND
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X IT CONFUSED ME WHY DID THESE ALLERGY SYMPTOMS PERSIST WELL PAST THE POLLEN SEASON
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X WITH THIS QUESTION IN MIND I STARTED RESEARCHING AND I SOON FOUND THAT INDOOR AIR POLLUTANTS WERE THE CULPRIT AS SOON AS I REALIZED THIS I INVESTIGATED THE UNDERLYING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FOUR PREVALENT AIR POLLUTANTS AND THEIR AFFECT ON THE LUNG HEALTH OF ASTHMATIC PATIENTS
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X AT FIRST I JUST WANTED TO FIGURE OUT WHICH OF THESE FOUR POLLUTANTS HAVE THE LARGEST NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACT ON THE LUNG HEALTH OF ASTHMATIC PATIENTS BUT SOON AFTER I DEVELOPED A NOVEL MATHEMATICAL MODEL THAT ESSENTIALLY QUANTIFIES THE EFFECT OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS ON THE LUNG HEALTH OF ASTHMATIC PATIENTS
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X AND IT SURPRISES ME THAT NO MODEL CURRENTLY EXISTS THAT QUANTIFIES THE EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ON HUMAN LUNG HEALTH BECAUSE THAT RELATIONSHIP SEEMS SO IMPORTANT
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X SO WITH THAT IN MIND I STARTED RESEARCHING MORE I STARTED INVESTIGATING MORE AND I BECAME VERY PASSIONATE BECAUSE I REALIZED THAT IF WE COULD FIND A WAY TO TARGET REMEDIATION WE COULD ALSO FIND A WAY TO TREAT ASTHMATIC PATIENTS MORE EFFECTIVELY
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X THESE CHEMICAL POLLUTANTS ARE CURRENTLY NOT A CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANT AS DEFINED BY THE U S CLEAN AIR
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X AND THE DOCTOR HAS HER SIT DOWN AND HE TAKES HER PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY HER EXHALATION RATE OR THE AMOUNT OF AIR THAT SHE CAN BREATHE OUT IN ONE BREATH
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X SO THAT PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE I 'VE ENTERED IT UP INTO THE INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE MODEL I 'VE ALSO ENTERED IN HER AGE HER GENDER AND HER HEIGHT I 'VE ASSUMED THAT SHE LIVES IN AN AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD WITH AVERAGE AIR POLLUTANT LEVELS
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X SO WHAT IT SHOWS IF YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT TOP GRAPH IN THE RIGHT HAND CORNER IT SHOWS JULIE 'S ACTUAL PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE IN THE YELLOW BAR THIS IS THE MEASUREMENT THAT SHE TOOK IN HER DOCTOR 'S OFFICE IN THE BLUE BAR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X IT SHOWS WHAT HER PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE WHAT HER EXHALATION RATE OR LUNG HEALTH SHOULD BE BASED ON HER AGE GENDER AND HEIGHT SO THE DOCTOR SEES THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE YELLOW BAR AND THE BLUE BAR AND HE SAYS WOW WE NEED TO GIVE HER STEROIDS MEDICATION AND INHALERS
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X BUT I WANT EVERYONE HERE TO REIMAGINE A WORLD WHERE INSTEAD OF PRESCRIBING STEROIDS INHALERS AND MEDICATION THE DOCTOR TURNS TO JULIE AND SAYS WHY DON 'T YOU GO HOME AND CLEAN OUT YOUR AIR FILTERS CLEAN OUT THE AIR DUCTS IN YOUR HOME IN YOUR WORKPLACE IN YOUR SCHOOL
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X STOP THE USE OF INCENSE AND CANDLES AND IF YOU 'RE REMODELING YOUR HOUSE TAKE OUT ALL THE CARPETING AND PUT IN HARDWOOD FLOORING
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X BECAUSE THESE SOLUTIONS ARE NATURAL THESE SOLUTIONS ARE SUSTAINABLE AND THESE SOLUTIONS ARE LONG TERM INVESTMENTS LONG TERM INVESTMENTS THAT WE 'RE MAKING FOR OUR GENERATION AND FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS BECAUSE THESE ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS THAT
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X JULIE CAN MAKE IN HER HOME HER WORKPLACE AND HER SCHOOL
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X ARE IMPACTING EVERYONE THAT LIVES AROUND HER SO I 'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS RESEARCH AND I REALLY WANT TO CONTINUE IT AND EXPAND IT TO MORE DISORDERS BESIDES ASTHMA MORE RESPIRATORY DISORDERS AS WELL AS MORE POLLUTANTS
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X BUT BEFORE I END MY TALK TODAY I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH ONE SAYING AND THAT SAYING IS THAT GENETICS LOADS THE GUN BUT THE ENVIRONMENT PULLS THE TRIGGER AND THAT MADE A HUGE IMPACT ON ME WHEN I WAS DOING THIS RESEARCH BECAUSE WHAT I FEEL IS A LOT OF US THINK THAT THE ENVIRONMENT IS AT A MACRO LEVEL
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X AND AIR QUALITY AND AIR POLLUTANTS HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THE LUNG HEALTH
