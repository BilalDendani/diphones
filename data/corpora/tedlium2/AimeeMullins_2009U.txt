AimeeMullins_2009U@13.73:24.67 SPEAKING TO A GROUP OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED KIDS AGES SIX TO EIGHT AT A CHILDREN 'S MUSEUM AND I BROUGHT WITH ME A BAG FULL OF LEGS SIMILAR TO THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU SEE UP HERE AND HAD THEM LAID OUT ON A TABLE
AimeeMullins_2009U@25.35:33.13 THE KIDS AND FROM MY EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW KIDS ARE NATURALLY CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW OR DON'T UNDERSTAND OR WHAT IS FOREIGN TO THEM
AimeeMullins_2009U@33.84:46.81 ONLY LEARN TO BE FRIGHTENED OF THOSE DIFFERENCES WHEN AN ADULT INFLUENCES THEM TO BEHAVE THAT WAY AND MAYBE CENSORS THAT NATURAL CURIOSITY OR YOU KNOW REINS IN THE QUESTION ASKING IN THE HOPES OF THEM BEING POLITE LITTLE KIDS
AimeeMullins_2009U@47.32:56.03 SO I JUST PICTURED A FIRST GRADE TEACHER OUT IN THE LOBBY WITH THESE UNRULY KIDS SAYING NOW WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T STARE AT HER LEGS BUT
AimeeMullins_2009U@56.85:70.10 THAT'S THE POINT THAT'S WHY I WAS THERE I WANTED TO INVITE THEM TO LOOK AND EXPLORE SO I MADE A DEAL WITH THE ADULTS THAT THE KIDS COULD COME IN WITHOUT ANY ADULTS FOR TWO MINUTES ON THEIR OWN THE DOORS OPEN
AimeeMullins_2009U@70.43:80.84 THE KIDS DESCEND ON THIS TABLE OF LEGS AND THEY ARE POKING AND PRODDING AND THEY'RE WIGGLING TOES AND THEY'RE TRYING TO PUT THEIR FULL WEIGHT ON THE SPRINTING LEG TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT AND I SAID KIDS
AimeeMullins_2009U@81.39:86.67 REALLY QUICKLY I WOKE UP THIS MORNING I DECIDED I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO JUMP OVER A HOUSE
AimeeMullins_2009U@94.08:97.04 DREAM UP RIGHT NOW WHAT KIND OF LEGS WOULD YOU BUILD ME
AimeeMullins_2009U@97.76:99.79 AND IMMEDIATELY A VOICE
AimeeMullins_2009U@106.34:114.85 AND OTHER THINGS THAT I DON'T AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH AND THEN ONE EIGHT YEAR OLD SAID HEY WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO
AimeeMullins_2009U@116.63:119.90 AND THE WHOLE ROOM INCLUDING ME WAS LIKE YEAH
AimeeMullins_2009U@123.53:128.97 I WENT FROM BEING A WOMAN THAT THESE KIDS WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO SEE AS DISABLED
AimeeMullins_2009U@129.89:135.87 TO SOMEBODY THAT HAD POTENTIAL THAT THEIR BODIES DIDN'T HAVE YET SOMEBODY THAT MIGHT EVEN BE SUPER ABLED
AimeeMullins_2009U@138.65:143.55 SOME OF YOU ACTUALLY SAW ME AT TED ELEVEN YEARS AGO AND
AimeeMullins_2009U@144.71:150.55 A LOT OF TALK ABOUT HOW LIFE CHANGING THIS CONFERENCE IS FOR BOTH SPEAKERS AND ATTENDEES AND I AM NO EXCEPTION
AimeeMullins_2009U@151.30:156.51 TED LITERALLY WAS THE LAUNCH PAD TO THE NEXT DECADE OF MY LIFE 'S EXPLORATION
AimeeMullins_2009U@157.77:167.24 AT THE TIME THE LEGS I PRESENTED WERE GROUNDBREAKING IN PROSTHETICS I HAD WOVEN CARBON FIBER SPRINTING LEGS MODELED AFTER THE HIND LEG OF A CHEETAH WHICH YOU MAY HAVE SEEN ON STAGE YESTERDAY
AimeeMullins_2009U@168.01:173.27 AND ALSO THESE VERY LIFE LIKE INTRINSICALLY PAINTED SILICONE LEGS
AimeeMullins_2009U@174.37:185.89 SO AT THE TIME IT WAS MY OPPORTUNITY TO PUT A CALL OUT TO INNOVATORS OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONAL MEDICAL PROSTHETIC COMMUNITY TO COME BRING THEIR TALENT TO THE SCIENCE AND TO THE ART
AimeeMullins_2009U@186.36:194.90 OF BUILDING LEGS SO THAT WE CAN STOP COMPARTMENTALIZING FORM FUNCTION AND AESTHETIC AND ASSIGNING THEM DIFFERENT VALUES
AimeeMullins_2009U@195.63:209.96 WELL LUCKY FOR ME A LOT OF PEOPLE ANSWERED THAT CALL AND THE JOURNEY STARTED FUNNY ENOUGH WITH A TED CONFERENCE ATTENDEE CHEE PEARLMAN WHO HOPEFULLY IS IN THE AUDIENCE SOMEWHERE TODAY SHE WAS THE EDITOR THEN OF A MAGAZINE CALLED ID
AimeeMullins_2009U@210.76:212.94 AND SHE GAVE ME A COVER STORY
AimeeMullins_2009U@221.13:230.60 ON THE DESIGN OF THE CHEETAH LEGS AROUND THE WORLD PEOPLE WOULD COME UP TO ME AFTER THE CONFERENCE AFTER MY TALK MEN AND WOMEN AND THE CONVERSATION WOULD GO SOMETHING LIKE THIS
AimeeMullins_2009U@233.49:236.10 YOU'RE VERY ATTRACTIVE YOU DON'T LOOK DISABLED
AimeeMullins_2009U@238.21:240.72 I THOUGHT WELL THAT'S AMAZING BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL
AimeeMullins_2009U@242.54:250.93 AND IT REALLY OPENED MY EYES TO THIS CONVERSATION THAT COULD BE EXPLORED ABOUT BEAUTY WHAT DOES A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN HAVE TO LOOK LIKE
AimeeMullins_2009U@252.10:257.83 SEXY BODY AND INTERESTINGLY FROM AN IDENTITY STANDPOINT WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO HAVE A DISABILITY
AimeeMullins_2009U@258.49:263.30 I MEAN PEOPLE PAMELA ANDERSON HAS MORE PROSTHETIC IN HER BODY THAN I DO NOBODY CALLS HER DISABLED
AimeeMullins_2009U@270.70:284.35 SO THIS MAGAZINE THROUGH THE HANDS OF GRAPHIC DESIGNER PETER SAVILLE WENT TO FASHION DESIGNER ALEXANDER MCQUEEN AND PHOTOGRAPHER NICK KNIGHT WHO WERE ALSO INTERESTED IN EXPLORING THAT CONVERSATION SO THREE MONTHS AFTER TED I FOUND MYSELF ON A PLANE
AimeeMullins_2009U@284.79:294.15 TO LONDON DOING MY FIRST FASHION SHOOT WHICH RESULTED IN THIS COVER FASHION ABLE THREE MONTHS AFTER THAT
AimeeMullins_2009U@295.17:306.48 I DID MY FIRST RUNWAY SHOW FOR ALEXANDER MCQUEEN ON A PAIR OF HAND CARVED WOODEN LEGS MADE FROM SOLID ASH NOBODY KNEW EVERYONE THOUGHT THEY WERE WOODEN BOOTS ACTUALLY I HAVE THEM ON STAGE WITH ME
AimeeMullins_2009U@329.24:332.70 INTO SOMETHING THAT INVITES THEM TO LOOK AND LOOK A LITTLE LONGER
AimeeMullins_2009U@333.42:335.10 AND MAYBE EVEN UNDERSTAND
AimeeMullins_2009U@336.33:344.01 I LEARNED THIS FIRSTHAND WITH MY NEXT ADVENTURE THE ARTIST MATTHEW BARNEY IN HIS FILM OPUS CALLED THE THE CREMASTER CYCLE
AimeeMullins_2009U@345.05:357.48 THIS IS WHERE IT REALLY HIT HOME FOR ME THAT MY LEGS COULD BE WEARABLE SCULPTURE AND EVEN AT THIS POINT I STARTED TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE NEED TO REPLICATE HUMAN NESS AS THE ONLY AESTHETIC IDEAL
AimeeMullins_2009U@358.39:369.44 SO WE MADE WHAT PEOPLE LOVINGLY REFERRED TO AS GLASS LEGS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ACTUALLY OPTICALLY CLEAR POLYURETHANE A K A BOWLING BALL MATERIAL HEAVY THEN WE MADE THESE LEGS THAT ARE
AimeeMullins_2009U@371.13:377.31 WITH A POTATO ROOT SYSTEM GROWING IN THEM AND BEETROOTS OUT THE TOP AND A VERY LOVELY BRASS TOE THAT'S A GOOD CLOSE UP OF THAT ONE
AimeeMullins_2009U@378.02:383.07 THEN ANOTHER CHARACTER WAS A HALF WOMAN HALF CHEETAH A LITTLE HOMAGE TO MY LIFE AS AN ATHLETE
AimeeMullins_2009U@392.07:399.91 THAT WHIPPED AROUND LIKE A GECKO AND THEN ANOTHER PAIR OF LEGS
AimeeMullins_2009U@400.33:414.76 WE COLLABORATED ON WERE THESE LOOK LIKE JELLYFISH LEGS ALSO POLYURETHANE AND THE ONLY PURPOSE THAT THESE LEGS CAN SERVE OUTSIDE THE CONTEXT OF THE FILM IS TO
AimeeMullins_2009U@415.86:416.96 SO WHIMSY
AimeeMullins_2009U@423.61:433.65 LEGS THAT VARIOUS PEOPLE HAVE MADE FOR ME AND WITH THEM I HAVE DIFFERENT NEGOTIATIONS OF THE TERRAIN UNDER MY FEET AND I CAN CHANGE MY HEIGHT I HAVE A VARIABLE OF FIVE DIFFERENT HEIGHTS
AimeeMullins_2009U@469.14:470.88 AND SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SHE SAID BUT
AimeeMullins_2009U@484.79:494.68 AS YOU WANT IT AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW THAT'S WHEN I KNEW THAT THE CONVERSATION WITH SOCIETY HAS CHANGED PROFOUNDLY IN THIS LAST DECADE
AimeeMullins_2009U@495.12:499.43 IT IS NO LONGER A CONVERSATION ABOUT OVERCOMING DEFICIENCY
AimeeMullins_2009U@499.85:501.06 IT'S A CONVERSATION ABOUT
AimeeMullins_2009U@506.75:510.41 LIMB DOESN'T REPRESENT THE NEED TO REPLACE LOSS ANYMORE
AimeeMullins_2009U@510.92:517.67 IT CAN STAND AS A SYMBOL THAT THE WEARER HAS THE POWER TO CREATE WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY WANT TO CREATE IN THAT SPACE
AimeeMullins_2009U@518.45:521.06 SO PEOPLE THAT SOCIETY ONCE CONSIDERED TO BE
AimeeMullins_2009U@523.02:529.12 CAN NOW BECOME THE ARCHITECTS OF THEIR OWN IDENTITIES AND INDEED CONTINUE TO CHANGE THOSE IDENTITIES
AimeeMullins_2009U@530.27:533.80 BY DESIGNING THEIR BODIES FROM A PLACE OF EMPOWERMENT
AimeeMullins_2009U@535.79:538.43 AND WHAT IS EXCITING TO ME SO MUCH RIGHT NOW
AimeeMullins_2009U@539.16:546.60 IS THAT BY COMBINING CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY ROBOTICS BIONICS WITH THE AGE OLD POETRY
AimeeMullins_2009U@555.51:559.58 THAT IF WE WANT TO DISCOVER THE FULL POTENTIAL IN OUR HUMANITY
AimeeMullins_2009U@560.35:566.78 WE NEED TO CELEBRATE THOSE HEARTBREAKING STRENGTHS AND THOSE GLORIOUS DISABILITIES THAT WE ALL HAVE
AimeeMullins_2009U@567.59:569.36 I THINK OF SHAKESPEARE 'S SHYLOCK
AimeeMullins_2009U@570.80:572.71 IF YOU PRICK US DO WE NOT BLEED
AimeeMullins_2009U@573.74:578.85 AND IF YOU TICKLE US DO WE NOT LAUGH IT IS OUR HUMANITY
AimeeMullins_2009U@580.09:582.02 AND ALL THE POTENTIAL WITHIN IT
AimeeMullins_2009U@582.77:585.45 THAT MAKES US BEAUTIFUL THANK YOU
