BobMankoff_2013S@90.03:95.34 BUT LIKE I SAID YOU CANNOT SATISFY EVERYONE YOU COULDN 'T SATISFY THIS GUY
BobMankoff_2013S@95.34:103.14 ANOTHER JOKE ON OLD WHITE MALES HA HA THE WIT IT 'S NICE I 'M SURE TO BE YOUNG AND RUDE BUT SOME DAY YOU 'LL BE OLD UNLESS YOU DROP
BobMankoff_2013S@128.64:140.12 AND WHEN YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THAT AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT ANYBODY ELSE IS LAUGHING AT AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT THE SUBJECTIVITY INVOLVED IN HUMOR IS REALLY INTERESTING LET 'S LOOK AT THIS CARTOON
BobMankoff_2013S@140.12:142.51 DISCOURAGING DATA ON THE ANTIDEPRESSANT
BobMankoff_2013S@157.25:167.98 GENERALLY ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE LIKED IT A HUNDRED AND NINE VOTED IT A TEN THE HIGHEST TEN VOTED IT ONE BUT LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES I LIKE ANIMALS LOOK HOW MUCH THEY LIKE THEM
BobMankoff_2013S@180.76:184.75 TO PEOPLE LIKE THIS I POINT OUT WE USE ANESTHETIC INK
BobMankoff_2013S@244.69:254.4 AND WE HAVE ONE THOUSAND CARTOONS OF COURSE MANY MANY CARTOONS MUST BE REJECTED NOW WE COULD FIT MORE CARTOONS IN THE MAGAZINE IF WE REMOVED THE ARTICLES
BobMankoff_2013S@257.53:261.75 BUT I FEEL THAT WOULD BE A HUGE LOSS
BobMankoff_2013S@266.96:282.46 CARTOONISTS COME IN THROUGH THE MAGAZINE EVERY WEEK THE AVERAGE CARTOONIST WHO STAYS WITH THE MAGAZINE DOES TEN OR FIFTEEN IDEAS EVERY WEEK BUT THEY MOSTLY ARE GOING TO BE REJECTED THAT 'S THE NATURE OF ANY CREATIVE ACTIVITY MANY OF THEM FADE AWAY
BobMankoff_2013S@282.46:287.35 SOME OF THEM STAY MATT DIFFEE IS ONE OF THEM HERE 'S ONE OF HIS CARTOONS
BobMankoff_2013S@312.44:330.42 NOW I KNOW ALL ABOUT REJECTION BECAUSE WHEN I QUIT ACTUALLY I WAS BOOTED OUT OF PSYCHOLOGY SCHOOL AND DECIDED TO BECOME A CARTOONIST A NATURAL SEGUE FROM ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR TO ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN I SUBMITTED TWO THOUSAND CARTOONS TO THE NEW YORKER AND GOT TWO THOUSAND CARTOONS REJECTED BY THE NEW YORKER
BobMankoff_2013S@331.62:340.6 AT A CERTAIN POINT THIS REJECTION SLIP IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN WE REGRET THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO USE THE ENCLOSED MATERIAL THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER IT MAGICALLY CHANGED TO THIS
BobMankoff_2013S@351.74:367.81 AND OF COURSE THAT IS NOT NEW YORKER HUMOR WHAT IS NEW YORKER HUMOR WELL AFTER ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN I BROKE INTO THE NEW YORKER AND STARTED SELLING CARTOONS FINALLY IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY I RECEIVED THE REVERED NEW YORKER CONTRACT WHICH I BLURRED OUT PARTS BECAUSE IT 'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS
BobMankoff_2013S@384.02:394.38 THE WORD IDEA DRAWINGS AND THAT 'S THE SINE QUA NON OF NEW YORKER CARTOONS SO WHAT IS AN IDEA DRAWING AN IDEA DRAWING IS SOMETHING THAT
BobMankoff_2013S@394.38:405.1 REQUIRES YOU TO THINK NOW THAT 'S NOT A CARTOON IT REQUIRES THINKING ON THE PART OF THE CARTOONIST AND THINKING ON YOUR PART TO MAKE IT INTO A CARTOON LAUGHTER HERE
BobMankoff_2013S@429.65:441.1 THE NEW YORKER AND I WHEN WE MADE COMMENTS THE CARTOON CARRIES A CERTAIN AMBIGUITY ABOUT WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS WHAT IS IT THE CARTOON IS IT REALLY ABOUT LEMMINGS NO IT 'S ABOUT US
BobMankoff_2013S@441.1:452.17 YOU KNOW IT 'S MY VIEW BASICALLY ABOUT RELIGION THAT THE REAL CONFLICT AND ALL THE FIGHTS BETWEEN RELIGION IS WHO HAS THE BEST IMAGINARY FRIEND
BobMankoff_2013S@460.55:462.42 ABOUT NEVER IS NEVER GOOD FOR YOU
BobMankoff_2013S@469.57:473.23 BUT COMPRESSED TO HOW ABOUT NEVER IS NEVER GOOD
BobMankoff_2013S@475.34:485.4 NOW THESE LOOK LIKE VERY DIFFERENT FORMS OF HUMOR BUT ACTUALLY THEY BEAR A GREAT SIMILARITY IN EACH INSTANCE OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE DEFIED
BobMankoff_2013S@485.4:498.7 IN EACH INSTANCE THE NARRATIVE GETS SWITCHED THERE 'S AN INCONGRUITY AND A CONTRAST IN NO THURSDAY 'S OUT HOW ABOUT NEVER IS NEVER GOOD FOR YOU WHAT YOU HAVE IS THE SYNTAX OF POLITENESS AND THE MESSAGE OF BEING RUDE
BobMankoff_2013S@498.7:509.11 THAT REALLY IS HOW HUMOR WORKS IT 'S A COGNITIVE SYNERGY WHERE WE MASH UP THESE TWO THINGS WHICH DON 'T GO TOGETHER AND TEMPORARILY IN OUR MINDS EXIST
BobMankoff_2013S@512.33:531.72 YOU HAVE THE PROPRIETY OF THE NEW YORKER AND THE VULGARITY OF THE LANGUAGE BASICALLY THAT 'S THE WAY HUMOR WORKS SO I 'M A HUMOR ANALYST YOU WOULD SAY NOW E B WHITE SAID ANALYZING HUMOR IS LIKE DISSECTING A FROG NOBODY IS MUCH INTERESTED AND THE FROG DIES WELL I 'M GOING TO KILL A FEW BUT THERE WON 'T BE ANY GENOCIDE
BobMankoff_2013S@547.55:560.92 HE 'S THE CRITIC HE 'S THE CRITIC OF HUMOR AND REALLY I 'M FORCED TO BE IN THAT POSITION WHEN I 'M AT THE NEW YORKER AND THAT 'S THE DANGER THAT I WILL BECOME
BobMankoff_2013S@702.81:705.42 I 'M THINKING ABOUT HAVING A CHILD
BobMankoff_2013S@711.19:715.13 YOU HAVE AN INTERESTING THE GUILTY LAUGH

BobMankoff_2013S@750.44:766.31 AND IF IT 'S COMPLETELY OKAY WHAT 'S THE JOKE OKAY AND SO THIS BENIGN THAT 'S TRUE OF NO THURSDAY 'S OUT HOW ABOUT NEVER IS NEVER GOOD FOR YOU IT 'S RUDE THE WORLD REALLY SHOULDN 'T BE THAT WAY WITHIN THAT CONTEXT WE FEEL IT 'S OKAY SO WITHIN THIS CONTEXT
BobMankoff_2013S@769.31:772.59 WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE NEW YORKER MAGAZINE
BobMankoff_2013S@774.19:778.96 T CELL ARMY CAN THE BODY 'S IMMUNE RESPONSE HELP TREAT CANCER
BobMankoff_2013S@823.7:827.99 WHEN WE 'RE IN A PLAYFUL MOOD WE WANT EXCITEMENT
BobMankoff_2013S@827.99:844.02 WE WANT HIGH AROUSAL WE FEEL EXCITED THEN IF WE 'RE IN A PURPOSEFUL MOOD THAT MAKES US ANXIOUS THE REJECTION COLLECTION IS ABSOLUTELY IN THIS FIELD YOU WANT TO BE STIMULATED YOU WANT TO BE AROUSED YOU WANT TO BE TRANSGRESSED
BobMankoff_2013S@861.58:878.34 HE LAUGHS HE IS BOTH IN DANGER AND SAFE INCREDIBLY AROUSED THERE 'S NO JOKE NO JOKE NEEDED IF YOU AROUSE PEOPLE ENOUGH AND GET THEM STIMULATED ENOUGH THEY WILL LAUGH AT VERY VERY LITTLE THIS IS ANOTHER CARTOON FROM THE REJECTION COLLECTION TOO SNUG
BobMankoff_2013S@910.96:926.57 THE GREAT SAM GROSS CARTOON THIS HAPPENED AFTER THE MUHAMMAD CONTROVERSY WHERE IT 'S MUHAMMAD IN HEAVEN THE SUICIDE BOMBER IS ALL IN LITTLE PIECES AND HE 'S SAYING TO THE SUICIDE BOMBER YOU 'LL GET THE VIRGINS WHEN WE FIND YOUR PENIS
BobMankoff_2013S@963.48:976.76 THESE CARTOONS ARE NOT ABOUT THEM THEY 'RE ABOUT US THE HUMOR REFLECTS BACK ON US THE EASIEST THING TO DO WITH HUMOR AND IT 'S PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE IS A FRIEND MAKES FUN OF AN ENEMY
BobMankoff_2013S@1014.08:1025.31 LOOK AT THIS CARTOON BY ROZ CHAST THE GUY READING THE OBITUARY TWO YEARS YOUNGER THAN YOU TWELVE YEARS OLDER THAN YOU THREE YEARS YOUR JUNIOR YOUR AGE ON THE DOT EXACTLY YOUR AGE
BobMankoff_2013S@1059.67:1067.52 SO IT FOCUSES ON OUR OBSESSIONS OUR NARCISSISM OUR FOILS AND OUR FOIBLES REALLY NOT SOMEONE ELSE
BobMankoff_2013S@1079.55:1096.24 ART AND SCIENCE IS WHAT 'S CALLED BISOCIATION YOU HAVE TO BRING TOGETHER IDEAS FROM DIFFERENT FRAMES OF REFERENCE AND YOU HAVE TO DO IT QUICKLY TO UNDERSTAND THE CARTOON IF THE DIFFERENT FRAMES OF REFERENCE DON 'T COME TOGETHER IN ABOUT FIVE SECONDS IT 'S NOT FUNNY BUT I THINK THEY WILL FOR YOU HERE
BobMankoff_2013S@1096.24:1100.45 DIFFERENT FRAMES OF REFERENCE YOU SLEPT WITH HER DIDN 'T YOU

BobMankoff_2013S@1192.06:1195.31 WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT 'S ABSURD BUT WE 'RE PUTTING THE TWO TOGETHER
BobMankoff_2013S@1208.4:1226.64 IN GENERAL PEOPLE WHO ENJOY MORE NONSENSE ENJOY MORE ABSTRACT ART THEY TEND TO BE LIBERAL LESS CONSERVATIVE THAT TYPE OF STUFF BUT FOR US AND FOR ME HELPING DESIGN THE HUMOR IT DOESN 'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO COMPARE ONE TO THE OTHER IT 'S SORT OF A SMORGASBORD THAT 'S MADE ALL INTERESTING
BobMankoff_2013S@1242.93:1249.49 NOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT NEW YORKER CARTOONS I 'D LIKE YOU TO STOP AND THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THEM THANK YOU
