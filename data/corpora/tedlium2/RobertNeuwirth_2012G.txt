RobertNeuwirth_2012G@19.7:24.36 AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPH I TOOK IN MAKOKO
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@24.36:34.28 SHANTYTOWN IN LAGOS NIGERIA IT 'S BUILT OVER THE LAGOON AND THERE ARE NO STREETS WHERE THERE CAN BE STORES TO SHOP AND SO THE STORE COMES TO YOU
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@34.28:47.9 AND IN THE SAME COMMUNITY THIS IS BUSINESS SYNERGY THIS IS THE BOAT THAT THAT LADY WAS PADDLING AROUND IN AND THIS ARTISAN MAKES THE BOAT AND THE PADDLES AND SELLS DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THE BOAT AND THE PADDLES
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@47.9:57.19 AND THIS IS A GLOBAL BUSINESS OGANDIRO SMOKES FISH IN MAKOKO IN LAGOS AND I ASKED HER WHERE DOES THE FISH COME FROM
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@70.1:87.86 TINY INCREMENT OF PROFIT ON THE STREETS OF LAGOS AND THIS IS A BUSINESS INCUBATOR THIS IS OLUSOSUN DUMP THE LARGEST GARBAGE DUMP IN LAGOS AND TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE WORK HERE AND I FOUND THIS OUT FROM THIS FELLOW ANDREW SABORU ANDREW SPENT SIXTEEN YEARS SCAVENGING MATERIALS ON THE DUMP
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@87.86:97.86 EARNED ENOUGH MONEY TO TURN HIMSELF INTO A CONTRACT SCALER WHICH MEANT HE CARRIED A SCALE AND WENT AROUND AND WEIGHED ALL THE MATERIALS THAT PEOPLE HAD SCAVENGED FROM THE DUMP NOW
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@97.93:105.9 HE 'S A SCRAP DEALER THAT 'S HIS LITTLE DEPOT BEHIND HIM AND HE EARNS TWICE THE NIGERIAN MINIMUM WAGE
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@105.9:121.86 THIS IS A SHOPPING MALL THIS IS OSHODI MARKET IN LAGOS JORGE LUIS BORGES HAD A STORY CALLED THE ALEPH AND THE ALEPH IS A POINT IN THE WORLD WHERE ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING EXISTS AND FOR ME THIS IMAGE IS A POINT IN THE WORLD WHERE ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING EXISTS
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@121.86:131.36 SO WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT WHEN I TALK ABOUT SYSTEM D IT 'S TRADITIONALLY CALLED THE INFORMAL ECONOMY THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY THE BLACK MARKET
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@131.36:148.61 I DON 'T CONCEIVE OF IT THAT WAY I THINK IT 'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS TOTALLY OPEN IT 'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING OPENLY AND ABOVEBOARD THERE 'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT IT 'S OUR PREJUDGMENT THAT IT 'S UNDERGROUND
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@148.61:158.33 I 'VE PIRATED THE TERM SYSTEM D FROM THE FORMER FRENCH COLONIES THERE 'S A WORD IN FRENCH THAT IS DEBROUILLARDISE THAT MEANS TO BE SELF RELIANT
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@158.33:167.58 AND THE FORMER FRENCH COLONIES HAVE TURNED THAT INTO SYSTEM D FOR THE ECONOMY OF SELF RELIANCE OR THE DIY ECONOMY
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@167.58:174.98 BUT GOVERNMENTS HATE THE DIY ECONOMY AND THAT 'S WHY I TOOK THIS PICTURE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@174.98:186.92 AND THIS IS THE SAME MARKET IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE AND I THINK WHEN THE ORGANIZERS OF THIS CONFERENCE WERE TALKING ABOUT RADICAL OPENNESS THEY DIDN 'T MEAN THAT THE STREETS SHOULD BE OPEN AND THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE GONE
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@204.94:207.23 USED FOR OTHER KINDS OF PROFIT
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@207.23:225.52 THIS IS THE PICKLE ECONOMY WE 'RE ALL FOCUSING ON THIS IS A STATISTIC FROM EARLIER THIS MONTH IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES WE 'RE ALL FOCUSING ON THE LUXURY ECONOMY IT 'S WORTH ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR AND THAT 'S A VAST AMOUNT OF MONEY RIGHT THAT 'S THREE TIMES THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT OF SWITZERLAND
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@254.05:257.6 CALL IT
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@257.6:263.61 THE UNITED STREET SELLERS REPUBLIC THE U S S R OR BAZAARISTAN IT WOULD BE
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@263.61:280.65 WORTH TEN TRILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR AND THAT WOULD MAKE IT THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AFTER THE UNITED STATES AND GIVEN THAT PROJECTIONS ARE THAT THE BULK OF ECONOMIC GROWTH OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS WILL COME FROM EMERGING ECONOMIES IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@280.65:288.76 IT COULD EASILY OVERTAKE THE UNITED STATES AND BECOME THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD SO THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT ARE VAST
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@321.98:325.26 BUT THE GALA SAUSAGE ROLL IS NOT SOLD IN STORES
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@340.09:348.3 AND IT 'S BEEN SOLD THAT WAY FOR FORTY YEARS IT 'S A BUSINESS PLAN FOR A CORPORATION AND IT 'S NOT JUST IN AFRICA
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@348.3:363.29 HERE 'S MR CLEAN LOOKING AMOROUSLY AT ALL THE OTHER PROCTER GAMBLE PRODUCTS AND PROCTER GAMBLE YOU KNOW THE STATISTIC ALWAYS CITED IS THAT WAL MART IS THEIR LARGEST CUSTOMER AND IT 'S TRUE AS ONE STORE
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@363.29:369.25 WAL MART BUYS FIFTEEN PERCENT THUS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF PROCTER GAMBLE 'S BUSINESS IS WITH WAL MART
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@369.25:381.54 BUT THEIR LARGEST MARKET SEGMENT IS SOMETHING THAT THEY CALL HIGH FREQUENCY STORES WHICH IS ALL THESE TINY KIOSKS AND THE LADY IN THE CANOE AND ALL THESE OTHER BUSINESSES THAT EXIST IN
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@381.54:392.92 SYSTEM D THE INFORMAL ECONOMY AND PROCTER GAMBLE MAKES TWENTY PERCENT OF ITS MONEY FROM THAT MARKET SEGMENT AND IT 'S THE ONLY MARKET SEGMENT THAT 'S GROWING
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@392.92:403.02 SO PROCTER GAMBLE SAYS WE DON 'T CARE WHETHER A STORE IS INCORPORATED OR REGISTERED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WE WANT OUR PRODUCTS IN THAT STORE
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@403.02:418.51 AND THEN THERE 'S MOBILE PHONES THIS IS AN AD FOR MTN WHICH IS A SOUTH AFRICAN MULTINATIONAL ACTIVE IN ABOUT TWENTY FIVE COUNTRIES AND WHEN THEY CAME INTO NIGERIA NIGERIA IS THE BIG DOG IN AFRICA ONE IN SEVEN AFRICANS IS A NIGERIAN
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@418.51:430.16 AND SO EVERYONE WANTS IN TO THE MOBILE PHONE MARKET IN NIGERIA AND WHEN MTN CAME IN THEY WANTED TO SELL THE MOBILE SERVICE LIKE I GET IN THE UNITED STATES OR LIKE PEOPLE GET HERE IN THE U K OR IN EUROPE
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@430.16:449.85 EXPENSIVE MONTHLY PLANS YOU GET A PHONE YOU PAY OVERAGES YOU 'RE KILLED WITH FEES AND THEIR PLAN CRASHED AND BURNED AND THEY WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND THEY RETOOLED AND THEY CAME UP WITH ANOTHER PLAN WE DON 'T SELL YOU THE PHONE WE DON 'T SELL YOU THE MONTHLY PLAN WE ONLY SELL YOU AIRTIME
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@449.85:463.1 AND WHERE 'S THE AIRTIME SOLD IT 'S SOLD AT UMBRELLA STANDS ALL OVER THE STREETS WHERE PEOPLE ARE UNREGISTERED UNLICENSED BUT MTN MAKES MOST OF ITS PROFITS
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@463.1:469.97 PERHAPS NINETY PERCENT OF ITS PROFITS FROM SELLING THROUGH SYSTEM D THE INFORMAL ECONOMY
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@469.97:485.57 AND WHERE DO THE PHONES COME FROM WELL THEY COME FROM HERE THIS IS IN GUANGZHOU CHINA AND IF YOU GO UPSTAIRS IN THIS RATHER SLEEPY LOOKING ELECTRONICS MALL YOU FIND THE GUANGZHOU DASHATOU SECOND HAND TRADE CENTER
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@485.57:504.21 AND IF YOU GO IN THERE YOU FOLLOW THE GUYS WITH THE MUSCLES WHO ARE CARRYING THE BOXES AND WHERE ARE THEY GOING THEY 'RE GOING TO EDDY IN LAGOS NOW MOST OF THE PHONES THERE ARE NOT SECOND HAND AT ALL THE NAME IS A MISNOMER MOST OF THEM ARE PIRATED THEY HAVE THE NAME BRAND ON THEM BUT THEY 'RE NOT MANUFACTURED BY THE NAME
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@533.37:538.74 YOU CAN BUY FAKE DESIGNER GLASSES YOU CAN BUY CLONED COLOGNE
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@557.15:570.22 NOW BUSINESSES TEND TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS AND THEIR THEY I DON 'T WANT TO TAKE AWAY FROM THEIR ENTIRE VALIDITY OF COMPLAINING ABOUT IT BUT I DID ASK A MAJOR SNEAKER MANUFACTURER EARLIER THIS YEAR
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@570.22:578.19 WHAT THEY THOUGHT ABOUT PIRACY AND THEY TOLD ME WELL YOU CAN 'T QUOTE ME ON THIS BECAUSE IF YOU QUOTE ME ON THIS I HAVE TO KILL YOU BUT
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@578.19:581.23 THEY USE PIRACY AS MARKET RESEARCH
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@581.23:594.72 THE SNEAKER MANUFACTURER TOLD ME THAT IF THEY FIND THAT PUMAS ARE BEING PIRATED OR ADIDAS ARE BEING PIRATED AND THEIR SNEAKERS AREN 'T BEING PIRATED THEY KNOW THEY 'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@605.42:624.18 NOW THERE 'S ANOTHER PROBLEM THIS IS A REAL STREET SIGN IN LAGOS NIGERIA ALL OF SYSTEM D REALLY DOESN 'T PAY TAXES RIGHT AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT FIRST OF ALL I THINK THAT GOVERNMENT IS A SOCIAL CONTRACT BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNMENT AND IF THE GOVERNMENT ISN 'T TRANSPARENT THEN THE PEOPLE AREN 'T GOING TO BE TRANSPARENT EITHER
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@624.19:643.11 BUT ALSO THAT WE 'RE BLAMING THE LITTLE GUY WHO DOESN 'T PAY HIS TAXES AND WE 'RE NOT RECOGNIZING THAT EVERYONE 'S FUDGING THINGS ALL OVER THE WORLD INCLUDING SOME EXTREMELY RESPECTED BUSINESSES AND I 'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE THERE WAS ONE COMPANY THAT PAID FOUR THOUSAND BRIBES IN THE FIRST DECADE OF THIS MILLENNIUM
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@643.11:655.83 AND A MILLION DOLLARS IN BRIBES EVERY BUSINESS DAY RIGHT ALL OVER THE WORLD AND THAT COMPANY WAS THE BIG GERMAN ELECTRONICS GIANT SIEMENS SO THIS GOES ON
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@655.83:667.5 IN THE FORMAL ECONOMY AS WELL AS THE INFORMAL ECONOMY SO IT 'S WRONG OF US TO BLAME AND I 'M NOT SINGLING OUT SIEMENS I 'M SAYING EVERYONE DOES IT OKAY I JUST WANT TO END BY SAYING THAT
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@667.5:677.93 IF ADAM SMITH HAD FRAMED OUT A THEORY OF THE FLEA MARKET INSTEAD OF THE FREE MARKET WHAT WOULD BE SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES FIRST
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@677.93:694.97 IT WOULD BE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT COULD BE CONSIDERED A COOPERATIVE AND THIS IS A THOUGHT FROM THE BRAZILIAN LEGAL SCHOLAR ROBERTO MANGABEIRA UNGER COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT IS A WAY FORWARD SECONDLY FROM THE AUSTRIAN ANARCHIST PHILOSOPHER PAUL FEYERABEND
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@694.97:710.13 FACTS ARE RELATIVE AND WHAT IS A MASSIVE RIGHT OF SELF RELIANCE TO A NIGERIAN BUSINESSPERSON IS CONSIDERED UNAUTHORIZED AND HORRIBLE TO OTHER PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN HOW PEOPLE DEFINE THINGS AND WHAT THEIR FACTS ARE
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@710.13:717.15 AND THIRD IS AND I 'M TAKING THIS FROM THE GREAT AMERICAN BEAT POET ALLEN GINSBERG THAT
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@717.15:724.33 ALTERNATE ECONOMIES BARTER AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF CURRENCY ALTERNATE CURRENCIES ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@724.33:728.25 AND HE TALKED ABOUT BUYING WHAT HE NEEDED JUST WITH HIS GOOD LOOKS
RobertNeuwirth_2012G@728.25:739.06 AND SO I JUST WANT TO LEAVE YOU THERE AND SAY THAT THIS ECONOMY IS A TREMENDOUS FORCE FOR GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
