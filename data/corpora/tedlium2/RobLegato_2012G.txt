RobLegato_2012G AND AS AN EXPERIMENT BECAUSE I DAUNTINGLY CREATE A TASK FOR MYSELF OF RECREATING A SATURN V LAUNCH
RobLegato_2012G FOR THIS PARTICULAR MOVIE BECAUSE I PUT IT OUT THERE I FELT A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT IT SO I NEED TO DO AN EXPERIMENT AND BRING A GROUP OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS IN A PROJECTION ROOM AND PLAY THIS STOCK FOOTAGE AND WHEN I PLAYED THIS STOCK FOOTAGE I SIMPLY WANTED TO FIND OUT
RobLegato_2012G WHAT PEOPLE REMEMBERED WHAT WAS MEMORABLE ABOUT IT WHAT SHOULD I ACTUALLY TRY TO REPLICATE WHAT SHOULD I TRY TO EMULATE TO SOME DEGREE
RobLegato_2012G WHAT WAS YOUR MEMORABLE SHOTS THEY CHANGED THEM THEY WERE
RobLegato_2012G WHAT I SHOULD DO IS NOT ACTUALLY REPLICATE WHAT THEY SAW IS REPLICATE WHAT THEY REMEMBERED SO THIS IS OUR FOOTAGE OF THE LAUNCH BASED ON
RobLegato_2012G BASICALLY TAKING NOTES ASKING PEOPLE WHAT THEY THOUGHT AND THEN THE COMBINATION OF ALL THE DIFFERENT SHOTS AND ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS PUT TOGETHER CREATED THEIR SORT OF COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS OF WHAT THEY REMEMBERED IT LOOKED LIKE BUT NOT WHAT IT REALLY LOOKED LIKE SO THIS IS WHAT WE CREATED FOR APOLLO THIRTEEN
RobLegato_2012G SO I WAS BASICALLY WAS SETTING UP SOMETHING THAT WOULD REMIND YOU OF SOMETHING YOU HAVEN 'T REALLY QUITE SEEN BEFORE
RobLegato_2012G AND SO BASICALLY IF YOU BELIEVED ANY OF THE STUFF THAT I JUST SHOWED YOU WHAT YOU WERE REACTING TO WHAT YOU 'RE EMOTING TO IS SOMETHING THAT 'S A TOTAL FALSEHOOD AND I FOUND THAT REALLY KIND OF FASCINATING AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THIS IS THE CLIMAX OF THE MOVIE AND YOU KNOW THE WEIGHT OF ACHIEVING IT WAS SIMPLY
RobLegato_2012G TAKE A MODEL THROW IT OUT OF A HELICOPTER AND SHOOT IT
RobLegato_2012G AND THAT 'S SIMPLY WHAT I DID THAT 'S ME SHOOTING AND I 'M A FAIRLY MEDIOCRE OPERATOR SO I GOT THAT NICE SENSE OF VERISIMILITUDE OF A KIND OF YOU KNOW FOLLOWING THE ROCKET ALL THE WAY DOWN AND GIVING THAT LITTLE SORT OF EDGE I WAS DESPERATELY TRYING TO KEEP IT IN FRAME
RobLegato_2012G SO THEN I COME UP TO THE NEXT THING WE HAD A NASA CONSULTANT WHO WAS ACTUALLY AN ASTRONAUT WHO WAS ACTUALLY ON SOME OF THE MISSIONS OF APOLLO FIFTEEN AND HE WAS THERE TO BASICALLY DOUBLE CHECK MY SCIENCE AND I GUESS SOMEBODY THOUGHT THEY NEEDED TO DO THAT
RobLegato_2012G I DON 'T KNOW WHY BUT THEY THOUGHT THEY DID SO WE WERE HE 'S A HERO HE 'S AN ASTRONAUT AND WE 'RE ALL SORT OF EXCITED AND YOU KNOW I GAVE MYSELF THE LIBERTY OF SAYING YOU KNOW SOME OF THE SHOTS I DID
RobLegato_2012G AND THEN HE BASICALLY TOLD ME WHAT HE THOUGHT
RobLegato_2012G IT 'S WHAT YOU DREAM ABOUT
RobLegato_2012G SO WHAT I GOT FROM HIM IS HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID
RobLegato_2012G YOU WOULD NEVER EVER DESIGN A ROCKET LIKE THAT YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE A ROCKET GO UP WHILE THE GANTRY ARMS ARE GOING OUT CAN YOU IMAGINE THE TRAGEDY THAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN
RobLegato_2012G WAS ON THIS IS APOLLO FIFTEEN THIS WAS HIS MISSION SO I SHOWED HIM THIS AND THE REACTION I GOT WAS INTERESTING
RobLegato_2012G AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS I MEAN WHAT I SORT OF INTUNED IN THAT IS THAT HE REMEMBERED IT DIFFERENTLY HE REMEMBERED THAT WAS A PERFECTLY SAFE SORT OF GANTRY SYSTEM PERFECTLY SAFE ROCKET LAUNCH BECAUSE HE 'S SITTING IN A ROCKET THAT HAS LIKE A HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS OF THRUST BUILT BY THE LOWEST BIDDER HE WAS HOPING IT WAS GOING TO WORK
RobLegato_2012G TWISTED HIS MEMORY AROUND NOW RON HOWARD RAN INTO BUZZ ALDRIN WHO WAS NOT ON THE MOVIE SO HE HAD NO IDEA THAT WE WERE FAKING ANY OF THIS FOOTAGE AND HE JUST RESPONDED AS HE WOULD RESPOND
RobLegato_2012G SO TITANIC WAS IF YOU DON 'T KNOW THE STORY DOESN 'T END WELL
RobLegato_2012G JIM CAMERON ACTUALLY PHOTOGRAPHED THE REAL TITANIC SO HE BASICALLY SET UP OR BASICALLY SHATTERED THE SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF BECAUSE WHAT HE PHOTOGRAPHED WAS THE REAL THING A MIR SUB GOING DOWN OR ACTUALLY TWO MIR SUBS GOING DOWN TO THE REAL WRECK
RobLegato_2012G AND HE CREATED THIS VERY HAUNTING FOOTAGE IT 'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL AND IT CONJURES UP ALL THESE VARIOUS DIFFERENT EMOTIONS BUT HE COULDN 'T PHOTOGRAPH
RobLegato_2012G SO I 'M GOING TO JUST LET IT RUN SO YOU KIND OF ABSORB THIS SORT OF THING AND I 'LL DESCRIBE MY SORT OF REACTIONS WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT IT FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME I GOT THE FEELING THAT MY BRAIN WANTED TO BASICALLY SEE IT COME BACK TO LIFE I AUTOMATICALLY WANTED TO SEE THIS SHIP THIS MAGNIFICENT SHIP
RobLegato_2012G BASICALLY IN ALL ITS GLORY AND CONVERSELY I WANTED TO SEE IT
RobLegato_2012G NOT IN ALL ITS GLORY BASICALLY GO BACK TO WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
RobLegato_2012G SO I CONJURED UP AN EFFECT THAT I 'M LATER GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT I TRIED TO DO WHICH IS KIND OF THE HEART OF THE MOVIE FOR ME
RobLegato_2012G AND SO THAT 'S WHY I WANTED TO DO THE MOVIE THAT 'S WHY I WANTED TO CREATE THE SORT OF THINGS I CREATED AND I 'LL SHOW YOU YOU KNOW ANOTHER THING THAT I FOUND INTERESTING IS WHAT WE REALLY WERE EMOTING TO WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT IT SO HERE 'S THE BEHIND THE SCENES A COUPLE OF LITTLE SHOTS HERE SO WHEN YOU SAW MY FOOTAGE
RobLegato_2012G YOU WERE SEEING THIS BASICALLY A BUNCH OF GUYS FLIPPING A SHIP UPSIDE DOWN AND THE LITTLE MIR SUBS ARE ACTUALLY ABOUT THE SIZE OF SMALL FOOTBALLS AND SHOT IN SMOKE
RobLegato_2012G JIM WENT THREE MILES WENT DOWN AND I WENT ABOUT THREE MILES AWAY FROM THE STUDIO AND PHOTOGRAPHED THIS IN A GARAGE AND SO BUT WHAT YOU 'RE EMOTING TO OR WHAT YOU 'RE LOOKING AT
RobLegato_2012G OUR BRAINS SORT OF ONCE YOU BELIEVE SOMETHING 'S REAL YOU TRANSFER EVERYTHING THAT YOU FEEL ABOUT IT THIS QUALITY YOU HAVE
RobLegato_2012G AND IT 'S TOTALLY ARTIFICIAL IT 'S TOTALLY MAKE BELIEVE YET IT 'S NOT TO YOU AND I FOUND THAT THAT WAS A VERY INTERESTING THING TO EXPLORE AND USE AND IT CAUSED ME TO CREATE THE NEXT EFFECT THAT I 'LL SHOW YOU WHICH IS
RobLegato_2012G THIS SORT OF MAGIC TRANSITION AND ALL I WAS REALLY ATTEMPTING TO DO IS BASICALLY HAVE THE AUDIENCE CUE THE EFFECT SO IT BECAME A SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE FOR THEM THAT I WASN 'T SHOWING YOU MY SORT OF INTERPRETATION I WAS SHOWING YOU WHAT YOU WANTED TO SEE
RobLegato_2012G AND THE VERY NEXT SHOT RIGHT AFTER THIS
RobLegato_2012G OKAY SO NOW THE TITANIC TRANSITION SO THIS IS WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO WHERE I WANTED TO
RobLegato_2012G BASICALLY MAGICALLY TRANSPLANT FROM ONE STATE OF THE TITANIC TO THE OTHER SO I 'LL JUST PLAY THE SHOT ONCE
RobLegato_2012G AND THEN AT SOME POINT I 'M CHANGING THE PERIPHERY OF THE SHOT I 'M CHANGING IT 'S BECOMING THE RUSTED WRECK
RobLegato_2012G AND THEN I WOULD RUN IT EVERY DAY AND THEN I WOULD FIND EXACTLY THE MOMENT THAT I STOPPED LOOKING AT THEM AND START NOTICING THE REST OF IT AND THE MOMENT MY EYE SHIFTED WE JUST MARKED IT TO THE FRAME THE MOMENT MY EYE SHIFTED I IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO CHANGE THEM SO NOW SOMEHOW YOU MISSED
RobLegato_2012G WHERE IT STARTED AND WHERE IT STOPPED AND SO I 'LL JUST SHOW IT ONE MORE TIME
RobLegato_2012G REALLY WANTED TO FEEL LIKE
RobLegato_2012G THEY WERE STILL ON THE WRECK ESSENTIALLY THAT 'S WHERE THEY WERE BURIED FOREVER
RobLegato_2012G WE SASHA BARON COHEN IS A VERY CLEVER VERY SMART GUY COMEDIAN WANTED TO BASICALLY DO AN HOMAGE TO THE KIND OF THE BUSTER KEATON SORT OF SLAPSTICK THINGS AND HE WANTED HIS LEG BRACE TO GET CAUGHT ON A MOVING TRAIN
RobLegato_2012G VERY DANGEROUS VERY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO AND PARTICULARLY ON OUR STAGE BECAUSE THERE LITERALLY IS NO WAY TO ACTUALLY MOVE THIS TRAIN BECAUSE IT FITS SO SNUGLY INTO OUR SET SO LET ME SHOW YOU THE SCENE
RobLegato_2012G AND THEN I BASICALLY USED THE TRICK THAT WAS IDENTIFIED BY SERGEI EISENSTEIN WHICH IS
RobLegato_2012G IF YOU HAVE A CAMERA THAT 'S MOVING WITH A MOVING OBJECT WHAT IS NOT MOVING APPEARS TO BE MOVING AND WHAT IS MOVING APPEARS TO BE STOPPED SO WHAT YOU 'RE ACTUALLY SEEING NOW IS THE TRAIN
RobLegato_2012G AND I THOUGHT IT WAS SORT OF AN INTERESTING THING BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF THE HOMAGE OF THE MOVIE ITSELF IS COMING UP WITH THIS SORT OF GENIUS TRICK WHICH I CAN 'T TAKE CREDIT FOR I 'D LOVE TO BUT I CAN
RobLegato_2012G YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO AND HE SAID SO LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET THIS STRAIGHT THE THING WITH THE WHEELS THAT DOESN 'T MOVE
RobLegato_2012G THE THING WITHOUT THE WHEELS THAT MOVES PRECISELY
RobLegato_2012G TRAIN STATION THAT ONLY HE CAN ACTUALLY NAVIGATE THROUGH AND DO IT THIS WAY AND WE HAD TO MAKE IT FEEL THAT THIS IS HIS NORMAL EVERYDAY SORT OF LIFE SO THE IDEA OF DOING IT AS ONE SHOT WAS VERY
RobLegato_2012G SORT OF GREAT FOR ME WAS IT WAS PROBABLY THE BEST REVIEWED SHOT I 'VE EVER WORKED ON AND YOU KNOW I WAS KIND OF PROUD OF IT WHEN I WAS DONE WHICH IS YOU SHOULD NEVER REALLY BE PROUD OF STUFF
