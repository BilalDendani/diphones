BillStone_2007 FIRST PLACE I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU IS WHAT MANY BELIEVE WILL BE
BillStone_2007 THE WORLD 'S DEEPEST NATURAL ABYSS AND I SAY BELIEVE BECAUSE THIS PROCESS IS STILL ONGOING RIGHT NOW THERE ARE MAJOR EXPEDITIONS BEING PLANNED FOR NEXT YEAR THAT I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
BillStone_2007 THINGS THAT'S CHANGED HERE IN THE LAST ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS SINCE JULES VERNE HAD GREAT SCIENCE FICTION CONCEPTS OF WHAT THE UNDERWORLD WAS LIKE IS THAT
BillStone_2007 AND CHAMBERS SO LARGE THAT YOU CAN SEE FOR HUNDREDS OF METERS WITHOUT A BREAK IN THE LINE OF SIGHT
BillStone_2007 WHEN YOU GO ON A THING LIKE THIS WE CAN USUALLY BE IN THE FIELD FOR ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO FOUR MONTHS WITH A TEAM OF AS SMALL AS TWENTY OR THIRTY TO AS BIG AS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
BillStone_2007 PEOPLE ASK ME YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE DO YOU GET FOR A PROJECT LIKE THIS AND WHILE OUR
BillStone_2007 BUT WE ALSO VALUE ESPRIT DE CORPS AND THE ABILITY TO DIPLOMATICALLY RESOLVE INTER PERSONAL CONFLICT WHILE UNDER GREAT STRESS IN REMOTE LOCATIONS
BillStone_2007 WE HAVE ALREADY GONE FAR BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HUMAN ENDURANCE FROM THE ENTRANCE THIS IS NOTHING LIKE A COMMERCIAL CAVE
BillStone_2007 YOU'RE LOOKING AT CAMP TWO IN A PLACE CALLED J TWO NOT K TWO BUT J TWO WE'RE ROUGHLY TWO DAYS FROM THE ENTRANCE AT THAT POINT AND
BillStone_2007 DAMP MOIST COLD CONDITIONS IN UTTERLY DARK PLACES I SHOULD MENTION THAT EVERYTHING YOU'RE SEEING HERE BY THE WAY IS ARTIFICIALLY ILLUMINATED AT GREAT EFFORT OTHERWISE IT IS COMPLETELY DARK IN THESE PLACES
BillStone_2007 DEEPER YOU GO THE MORE YOU RUN INTO A CONFLICT WITH WATER IT'S BASICALLY LIKE A TREE COLLECTING WATER COMING DOWN
BillStone_2007 AND EVENTUALLY YOU GET TO PLACES WHERE IT IS FORMIDABLE AND DANGEROUS AND UNFORTUNATELY SLIDES JUST DON'T DO JUSTICE SO I'VE GOT A VERY BRIEF CLIP HERE
BillStone_2007 TAKEN IN THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES
BillStone_2007 DESCEND INTO HUAUTLA PLATEAU IN MEXICO
BillStone_2007 I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THE TECHNIQUES BEING SHOWN HERE ARE OBSOLETE AND DANGEROUS WE WOULD NOT DO THIS TODAY UNLESS WE WERE DOING IT FOR FILM
BillStone_2007 ALONG THAT SAME LINE
BillStone_2007 TO TELL YOU THAT WITH THE SPATE OF HOLLYWOOD MOVIES
BillStone_2007 CAME OUT LAST YEAR WE HAVE NEVER SEEN MONSTERS UNDERGROUND
BillStone_2007 AT LEAST THE KIND THAT EAT YOU IF THERE IS
BillStone_2007 A MONSTER UNDERGROUND IT IS THE CRUSHING PSYCHOLOGICAL REMOTENESS THAT BEGINS TO HIT EVERY MEMBER OF THE TEAM ONCE YOU CROSS ABOUT THREE DAYS INBOUND FROM THE NEAREST ENTRANCE
BillStone_2007 NEXT YEAR I'LL BE LEADING AN INTERNATIONAL TEAM TO J TWO WE'RE GOING TO BE SHOOTING FROM MINUS TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED METERS THAT'S A LITTLE OVER EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FEET DOWN
BillStone_2007 AT THIRTY KILOMETERS FROM THE ENTRANCE THE LEAD CREWS WILL BE UNDERGROUND FOR PUSHING THIRTY DAYS STRAIGHT I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN A MISSION LIKE THAT IN A LONG TIME
BillStone_2007 WHEN YOU USED TO FIND THESE THINGS THEY WOULD PUT A LABEL ON A MAP THAT SAID TERMINAL SIPHON NOW I REMEMBER THAT TERM REALLY WELL FOR TWO REASONS NUMBER ONE IT'S THE NAME OF MY ROCK BAND AND
BillStone_2007 SECOND IS BECAUSE THE CONFRONTATION OF THESE THINGS FORCED ME TO BECOME AN INVENTOR AND WE'VE SINCE GONE ON TO DEVELOP MANY GENERATIONS OF GADGETS
BillStone_2007 FOR EXPLORING PLACES LIKE THIS THIS IS SOME LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT CLOSED CYCLE AND YOU CAN USE THAT NOW TO GO FOR MANY KILOMETERS HORIZONTALLY UNDERWATER AND TO DEPTHS OF TWO HUNDRED METERS STRAIGHT DOWN UNDERWATER
BillStone_2007 WHEN YOU DO THIS KIND OF STUFF IT'S LIKE DOING EVA IT'S LIKE DOING EXTRA VEHICULAR ACTIVITY IN SPACE
BillStone_2007 AT MUCH GREATER DISTANCES AND AT MUCH GREATER PHYSICAL PERIL SO IT MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT HOW TO DESIGN YOUR EQUIPMENT FOR LONG RANGE AWAY FROM A SAFE HAVEN HERE 'S A
BillStone_2007 THIS IS WHERE THE
BillStone_2007 IT WAS DEVELOPED WITHIN A TWO YEAR PERIOD AND USED ON ACTUAL EXPLORATORY PROJECTS THIS GADGET YOU SEE RIGHT HERE WAS CALLED THE DIGITAL WALL MAPPER AND
BillStone_2007 IT PRODUCED THE FIRST THREE DIMENSIONAL MAP ANYBODY HAS EVER DONE OF A CAVE AND IT HAPPENED TO BE UNDERWATER IN WAKULLA SPRINGS IT WAS THAT GADGET THAT SERENDIPITOUSLY OPENED A DOOR TO ANOTHER UNEXPLORED WORLD
BillStone_2007 THIS IS EUROPA CAROLYN PORCO MENTIONED ANOTHER ONE CALLED ENCELADUS THE OTHER DAY THIS IS ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE
BillStone_2007 COUPLE OF YEARS AGO CALLED ALIENS OF THE DEEP THERE WAS A BRIEF CLIP
BillStone_2007 A MISSION TO EXPLORE UNDER THE ICE OF EUROPA WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE
BillStone_2007 TO
BillStone_2007 IT'S BASICALLY A NUCLEAR HEATED TORPEDO
BillStone_2007 WHEN YOU REACH THE SURFACE
BillStone_2007 NEEDS TO BE ONE SMART PUPPY ABLE TO NAVIGATE AND MAKE DECISIONS
BillStone_2007 JIM DIDN'T KNOW WHEN HE RELEASED THAT MOVIE WAS THAT SIX MONTHS EARLIER NASA HAD FUNDED A TEAM I ASSEMBLED
BillStone_2007 THREE YEARS OF ENGINEERING MEETINGS DESIGN AND SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND INTRODUCED DEPTHX DEEP PHREATIC THERMAL EXPLORER AND AS THE MOVIE SAYS THIS IS ONE SMART PUPPY
BillStone_2007 MORE THAN TEN KILOS OF TNT IN ELECTRICAL ONBOARD EQUIVALENT THIS IS THE TARGET SITE THE WORLD 'S DEEPEST HYDROTHERMAL SPRING AT CENOTE ZACATON IN NORTHERN MEXICO IT'S BEEN EXPLORED TO A DEPTH OF TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO METERS AND BEYOND THAT NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING
BillStone_2007 THIS IS PART OF DEPTHX 'S MISSION THERE'S TWO PRIMARY TARGETS WE'RE DOING HERE ONE IS HOW DO YOU DO SCIENCE AUTONOMY UNDERGROUND HOW DO YOU TAKE A ROBOT AND TURN IT INTO A FIELD
BillStone_2007 WALL WHERE THERE'S A HIGH PROBABILITY OF LIFE WE MOVE ALONG THE WALL IN WHAT'S CALLED PROXIMITY OPERATIONS LOOKING FOR CHANGES IN COLOR IF WE SEE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS INTERESTING WE PULL IT INTO A MICROSCOPE IF IT PASSES THE MICROSCOPIC TEST
BillStone_2007 WE GO FOR A COLLECTION WE EITHER DRAW IN A LIQUID SAMPLE OR WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE A SOLID CORE FROM THE WALL NO HANDS AT THE WHEEL THIS IS ALL BEHAVIORAL AUTONOMY HERE THAT'S BEING CONDUCTED BY THE ROBOT ON ITS OWN
BillStone_2007 THE REAL HAT TRICK FOR THIS VEHICLE THOUGH IS A DISRUPTIVE NEW NAVIGATION SYSTEM WE'VE DEVELOPED KNOWN AS THREE D SLAM FOR SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION AND MAPPING
BillStone_2007 AN ALL SEEING EYEBALL ITS SENSOR BEAMS LOOK BOTH FORWARD AND BACKWARD AT THE SAME TIME ALLOWING IT TO DO NEW EXPLORATION WHILE IT'S STILL ACHIEVING GEOMETRIC SENSOR LOCK ON WHAT IT'S GONE THROUGH ALREADY WHAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU NEXT
BillStone_2007 IS THE FIRST FULLY AUTONOMOUS
BillStone_2007 THIS MAY WE'RE GOING TO GO FROM MINUS ONE THOUSAND METERS IN ZACATON AND IF WE'RE VERY LUCKY DEPTHX WILL BRING BACK THE FIRST ROBOTICALLY DISCOVERED DIVISION OF BACTERIA
BillStone_2007 THE SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF THAT MISSION WILL RESULT IN INFREQUENT VISITATION OF THE MOON BY A SMALL NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT SCIENTISTS AND PILOTS
BillStone_2007 IT WILL LEAVE US NO FURTHER ALONG IN THE GENERAL EXPANSION OF HUMANITY INTO SPACE THAN WE WERE FIFTY YEARS AGO
BillStone_2007 TO SHOW YOU NEXT ARE A COUPLE OF CONTROVERSIAL IDEAS AND I HOPE YOU'LL BEAR WITH ME AND HAVE SOME FAITH THAT THERE'S CREDIBILITY BEHIND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SAY HERE
BillStone_2007 THERE ARE THREE
BillStone_2007 UNDERPINNINGS
BillStone_2007 IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR ECONOMICAL EARTH TO SPACE TRANSPORT
BillStone_2007 THE BERT RUTANS AND RICHARD BRANSONS OF THIS WORLD HAVE GOT THIS IN THEIR SIGHTS AND I SALUTE THEM GO GO GO THE NEXT THING WE NEED
BillStone_2007 ARE PLACES TO STAY ON ORBIT ORBITAL HOTELS TO START WITH BUT WORKSHOPS FOR THE REST OF US LATER ON
BillStone_2007 THE FINAL MISSING PIECE THE REAL PARADIGM BUSTER IS THIS
BillStone_2007 A GAS STATION ON ORBIT IT'S NOT GOING TO LOOK LIKE THAT
BillStone_2007 IF IT EXISTED IT WOULD CHANGE ALL FUTURE SPACECRAFT DESIGN AND SPACE MISSION PLANNING NOW
BillStone_2007 TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THAT IN ORBIT
BillStone_2007 THE SECOND IS MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF THE WEIGHT OF A VEHICLE IS IN PROPELLANT
BillStone_2007 THUS EVERY TIME YOU'D WANT TO DO ANYTHING IN SPACE
BillStone_2007 YOU ARE LITERALLY BLOWING AWAY ENORMOUS SUMS OF MONEY EVERY TIME YOU HIT THE ACCELERATOR NOT EVEN THE GUYS AT TESLA CAN FIGHT THAT PHYSICS
BillStone_2007 SO WHAT
BillStone_2007 A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN IN FACT YOU CAN GET IT BETTER YOU CAN GET IT AT FOURTEEN TIMES LOWER IF YOU CAN FIND PROPELLANT ON THE MOON
BillStone_2007 WAS A STRONG HYDROGEN SIGNATURE AT SHACKLETON CRATER ON THE SOUTH POLE OF THE MOON
BillStone_2007 THAT SIGNAL WAS SO STRONG IT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY TEN TRILLION TONS OF WATER BURIED IN THE SEDIMENT COLLECTED OVER MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF YEARS BY THE IMPACT OF ASTEROIDS AND COMET MATERIAL
BillStone_2007 IF WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT AND MAKE THAT GAS STATION POSSIBLE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO MOVE LARGE VOLUMES OF PAYLOAD THROUGH SPACE WE CAN'T DO THAT RIGHT NOW
BillStone_2007 THE WAY YOU NORMALLY BUILD A SYSTEM RIGHT NOW IS YOU HAVE A TUBE STACK THAT HAS TO BE LAUNCHED FROM THE GROUND AND RESIST ALL KINDS OF AERODYNAMIC FORCES WE HAVE TO BEAT THAT
BillStone_2007 WE CAN DO IT BECAUSE IN SPACE THERE ARE NO AERODYNAMICS WE CAN GO AND USE INFLATABLE SYSTEMS FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING THIS IS AN IDEA THAT AGAIN
BillStone_2007 TO JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING BOB BIGELOW CURRENTLY HAS A TEST ARTICLE IN THE ORBIT WE CAN GO MUCH FURTHER WE CAN BUILD SPACE TUGS ORBITING PLATFORMS FOR HOLDING CRYOGENS AND WATER
BillStone_2007 THERE'S ANOTHER THING WHEN YOU'RE COMING BACK FROM THE MOON YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH ORBITAL MECHANICS IT SAYS YOU'RE MOVING TEN THOUSAND FEET PER SECOND FASTER THAN YOU REALLY WANT TO BE
BillStone_2007 TO GET BACK TO YOUR GAS STATION YOU GOT TWO CHOICES YOU CAN BURN ROCKET FUEL TO GET THERE OR YOU CAN DO SOMETHING REALLY INCREDIBLE
BillStone_2007 THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH TO SPACE EXPLORATION HAS BEEN THAT YOU CARRY ALL THE FUEL YOU NEED TO GET EVERYBODY BACK IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY
BillStone_2007 IF YOU TRY TO DO THAT FOR THE MOON YOU'RE GOING TO BURN A BILLION DOLLARS IN FUEL ALONE SENDING A CREW OUT THERE BUT IF YOU SEND A MINING TEAM THERE WITHOUT THE RETURN PROPELLANT FIRST
BillStone_2007 THIS IS NOT LIKE THAT I'M MUCH MORE LIKE SCOTTY I LIKE THIS EQUIPMENT YOU KNOW AND I REALLY VALUE IT SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO BURN THE GEAR BUT
BillStone_2007 IF YOU WERE TRULY BOLD YOU COULD GET IT THERE MANUFACTURE IT AND IT WOULD BE THE MOST DRAMATIC DEMONSTRATION THAT YOU COULD DO SOMETHING WORTHWHILE OFF THIS PLANET THAT HAS EVER BEEN DONE
BillStone_2007 THAT'S NOT TRUE IN SEVEN YEARS WE COULD PULL OFF AN INDUSTRIAL MISSION TO SHACKLETON AND DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU COULD PROVIDE COMMERCIAL REALITY OUT OF THIS IN LOW EARTH ORBIT
BillStone_2007 THE ORBITAL REFUELING STATIONS I'VE JUST DESCRIBED COULD CREATE AN ENTIRELY NEW INDUSTRY AND PROVIDE THE FINAL KEY FOR OPENING SPACE TO THE GENERAL EXPLORATION TO BUST THE PARADIGM A RADICALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH IS NEEDED
BillStone_2007 WE CAN DO IT BY JUMP STARTING WITH AN INDUSTRIAL LEWIS AND CLARK EXPEDITION TO SHACKLETON CRATER
BillStone_2007 LIKE TO CLOSE HERE
BillStone_2007 BY PUTTING A STAKE IN THE SAND AT TED
BillStone_2007 I INTEND TO LEAD THAT EXPEDITION
BillStone_2007 IT CAN BE DONE IN SEVEN YEARS WITH THE RIGHT BACKING
BillStone_2007 THOSE WHO JOIN ME IN MAKING IT HAPPEN WILL BECOME A PART OF HISTORY AND JOIN OTHER BOLD INDIVIDUALS FROM TIME PAST WHO HAD THEY BEEN HERE TODAY WOULD HAVE HEARTILY APPROVED
BillStone_2007 THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN PEOPLE DID BOLD THINGS TO OPEN THE FRONTIER
BillStone_2007 WE HAVE COLLECTIVELY FORGOTTEN THAT LESSON
BillStone_2007 NOW WE'RE AT A TIME WHEN BOLDNESS IS REQUIRED TO MOVE FORWARD
BillStone_2007 ONE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER SIR ERNEST SHACKLETON WROTE THESE WORDS
BillStone_2007 I INTEND TO PLANT AN INDUSTRIAL FLAG ON THE MOON AND COMPLETE THE FINAL PIECE THAT WILL OPEN THE SPACE FRONTIER IN OUR TIME FOR ALL OF US THANK YOU
