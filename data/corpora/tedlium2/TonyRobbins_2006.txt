TonyRobbins_2006@15.56:28.28 HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M BOTH CHALLENGED AND EXCITED MY EXCITEMENT IS I GET A CHANCE TO GIVE SOMETHING BACK MY CHALLENGE IS THE SHORTEST SEMINAR I USUALLY DO IS FIFTY HOURS I'M NOT EXAGGERATING I DO WEEKENDS AND WHAT I DO
TonyRobbins_2006@41.74:54.99 I'M REALLY IN A POSITION I'M NOT HERE TO MOTIVATE YOU OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T NEED THAT AND A LOT OF TIMES THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE THINK I DO AND IT'S THE FURTHEST THING FROM IT WHAT HAPPENS THOUGH IS PEOPLE SAY TO ME I DON'T NEED ANY MOTIVATION AND I SAY WELL THAT'S INTERESTING THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO I'M THE WHY GUY
TonyRobbins_2006@55.81:57.50 I WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU DO WHAT YOU DO
TonyRobbins_2006@57.99:59.69 WHAT IS YOUR MOTIVE FOR ACTION
TonyRobbins_2006@60.57:69.14 WHAT IS IT THAT DRIVES YOU IN YOUR LIFE TODAY NOT TEN YEARS AGO OR ARE YOU RUNNING THE SAME PATTERN BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE INVISIBLE FORCE OF INTERNAL DRIVE
TonyRobbins_2006@84.68:94.42 WE CAN I AGREE WITH WHAT WAS DESCRIBED A FEW DAYS AGO ABOUT THIS IDEA THAT PEOPLE WORK IN THEIR SELF INTEREST BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT'S BULLSHIT AT TIMES YOU DON'T WORK IN YOUR SELF INTEREST ALL THE TIME
TonyRobbins_2006@115.58:125.13 AND TWO SO THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN NOT JUST UNDERSTAND OTHER PEOPLE MORE BUT MAYBE APPRECIATE THEM MORE AND CREATE THE KINDS OF CONNECTIONS THAT CAN STOP SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO GET
TonyRobbins_2006@136.82:149.04 SO I'VE HAD AN OBSESSION BASICALLY FOR THIRTY YEARS AND THAT OBSESSION HAS BEEN WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF PEOPLES LIVES WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I GOT HIRED TO DO I'VE GOT TO PRODUCE THE RESULT NOW THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE FOR THIRTY YEARS
TonyRobbins_2006@149.40:159.80 I GET THE PHONE CALL WHEN THE ATHLETE IS BURNING DOWN ON NATIONAL TELEVISION AND THEY WERE AHEAD BY FIVE STROKES AND NOW THEY CAN'T GET BACK ON THE COURSE AND I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW TO GET THE RESULT OR NOTHING MATTERS
TonyRobbins_2006@174.76:183.88 SO WHEN I GET THOSE CALLS ABOUT PERFORMANCE THAT'S ONE THING HOW DO YOU MAKE A CHANGE BUT ALSO I'M LOOKING TO SEE WHAT IS IT THAT'S SHAPING THAT PERSON 'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE
TonyRobbins_2006@209.14:215.95 SCIENCE IS EASY RIGHT WE KNOW THE RULES YOU WRITE THE CODE YOU FOLLOW THE AND YOU GET THE RESULTS ONCE YOU KNOW THE GAME YOU JUST YOU KNOW YOU UP THE ANTE DON'T YOU
TonyRobbins_2006@216.54:223.13 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO FULFILLMENT THAT'S AN ART AND THE REASON IS IT'S ABOUT APPRECIATION AND IT'S ABOUT CONTRIBUTION YOU CAN ONLY FEEL SO MUCH
TonyRobbins_2006@224.59:230.77 SO I'VE HAD AN INTERESTING LABORATORY TO TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF THE REAL QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN SOMEBODY 'S LIFE IF YOU LOOK AT SOMEBODY LIKE
TonyRobbins_2006@231.24:240.10 THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOU'VE GIVEN EVERYTHING TO LIKE ALL THE RESOURCES THEY SAY THEY NEED YOU GAVE THEM NOT A ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR COMPUTER YOU GAVE THEM THE BEST COMPUTER YOU GAVE THEM LOVE YOU GAVE THEM JOY YOU WERE THERE TO COMFORT THEM
TonyRobbins_2006@240.57:247.65 AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE VERY OFTEN AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM I'M SURE END UP THE REST OF THEIR LIFE WITH ALL THIS LOVE EDUCATION MONEY AND BACKGROUND SPENDING THEIR LIFE GOING IN AND
TonyRobbins_2006@278.48:288.77 THE PAST EQUALS THE FUTURE AND OF COURSE IT DOES IF YOU LIVE THERE BUT WHAT PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM KNOW AND WHAT WE HAVE TO REMIND OURSELVES THOUGH BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW SOMETHING INTELLECTUALLY YOU CAN KNOW WHAT TO DO AND THEN NOT USE IT NOT APPLY
TonyRobbins_2006@304.30:317.86 BUT IF YOU ASK PEOPLE WHY DIDN'T YOU ACHIEVE SOMETHING SOMEBODY WHO 'S WORKING FOR YOU YOU KNOW OR A PARTNER OR EVEN YOURSELF WHEN YOU FAIL TO ACHIEVE A GOAL WHAT'S THE REASON PEOPLE SAY THEY FAIL TO ACHIEVE WHAT DO THEY TELL YOU DON'T HAVE THE DIDN'T KNOW ENOUGH DIDN'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE DIDN'T HAVE
TonyRobbins_2006@352.94:362.39 THEY ARE A CLAIM TO YOU MISSING RESOURCES AND THEY MAY BE ACCURATE YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE MONEY YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE SUPREME COURT BUT THAT IS NOT THE DEFINING FACTOR
TonyRobbins_2006@369.33:370.11 IF I'M WRONG
TonyRobbins_2006@371.00:379.96 THE DEFINING FACTOR IS NEVER RESOURCES IT'S RESOURCEFULNESS AND WHAT I MEAN SPECIFICALLY RATHER THAN JUST SOME PHRASE IS IF YOU HAVE EMOTION HUMAN EMOTION
TonyRobbins_2006@395.74:397.98 HOW EASY FOR ME TO TELL HIM WHAT HE SHOULD DO
TonyRobbins_2006@400.67:401.88 IDIOT ROBBINS
TonyRobbins_2006@402.69:408.17 BUT I KNOW WHEN WE WATCHED THE DEBATE AT THAT TIME
TonyRobbins_2006@408.50:422.42 THERE WERE EMOTIONS THAT BLOCKED PEOPLE 'S ABILITY TO GET THIS MAN 'S INTELLECT AND CAPACITY AND THE WAY THAT IT CAME ACROSS TO SOME PEOPLE ON THAT DAY BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO VOTE IN YOUR DIRECTION AND DIDN 'T AND I WAS UPSET BUT THERE WAS EMOTION THAT WAS THERE HOW MANY KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
TonyRobbins_2006@424.45:424.60 SO
TonyRobbins_2006@434.45:445.65 MONEY BUT YOU'RE CREATIVE AND DETERMINED ENOUGH YOU FIND THE WAY SO THIS IS THE ULTIMATE RESOURCE BUR THIS IS NOT THE STORY THAT PEOPLE TELL US RIGHT THE STORY PEOPLE TELL US IS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT STORIES THEY TELL US WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES BUT ULTIMATELY
TonyRobbins_2006@445.82:453.00 IF YOU TAKE A LOOK HERE FLIP IT UP IF YOU WOULD THEY SAY WHAT ARE ALL THE REASONS THEY HAVEN'T ACCOMPLISHED THAT NEXT ONE PLEASE HE 'S BROKEN MY PATTERN THAT SON OF
TonyRobbins_2006@457.76:458.27 THE ENERGY
TonyRobbins_2006@474.98:487.44 GOT TO GIVE IT A MEANING AND WHATEVER THAT MEANING IS PRODUCES EMOTION IS THIS THE END OR THE BEGINNING IS GOD PUNISHING ME OR REWARDING ME OR IS THIS THE ROLL OF THE DICE AN EMOTION THEN CREATES WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO OR THE ACTION
TonyRobbins_2006@487.80:501.56 SO THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN LIFE THE DECISIONS THAT HAVE SHAPED YOUR DESTINY AND THAT SOUNDS REALLY HEAVY BUT IN THE LAST FIVE OR TEN YEARS FIFTEEN YEARS HOW HAVE THERE BEEN SOME DECISIONS YOU'VE MADE THAT IF YOU'D MADE A DIFFERENT DECISION YOUR LIFE WOULD BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HOW MANY CAN THINK ABOUT IT HONESTLY BETTER OR WORSE
TonyRobbins_2006@507.94:519.56 I KNOW THE GOOGLE GENIUSES I SAW HERE I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR DECISION WAS TO SELL THEIR TECHNOLOGY AT FIRST WHAT IF THEY MADE THAT DECISION VERSUS TO BUILD THEIR OWN CULTURE HOW WOULD THE WORLD BE DIFFERENT HOW WOULD THEIR LIVES BE DIFFERENT THEIR IMPACT
TonyRobbins_2006@520.22:526.37 THE HISTORY OF OUR WORLD IS THESE DECISIONS WHEN A WOMAN STANDS UP AND SAYS NO I WON 'T GO TO THE BACK OF THE BUS
TonyRobbins_2006@530.00:535.02 OR SOMEONE STANDING IN FRONT OF A TANK OR BEING IN A POSITION LIKE LANCE ARMSTRONG AND SOMEONE SAYS TO YOU
TonyRobbins_2006@535.13:546.07 YOU 'VE GOT TESTICULAR CANCER THAT'S PRETTY TOUGH FOR ANY MALE ESPECIALLY IF YOU RIDE A BIKE YOU'VE GOT IT IN YOUR BRAIN YOU'VE GOT IT IN YOUR LUNGS BUT WHAT WAS HIS DECISION OF WHAT TO FOCUS ON
TonyRobbins_2006@546.54:555.28 MOST PEOPLE WHAT DID IT MEAN IT WASN'T THE END IT WAS THE BEGINNING WHAT AM I GOING TO DO HE GOES OFF AND WINS SEVEN CHAMPIONSHIPS HE NEVER ONCE WON BEFORE THE CANCER BECAUSE HE GOT EMOTIONAL FITNESS
