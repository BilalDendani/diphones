TonyRobbins_2006 HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M BOTH CHALLENGED AND EXCITED MY EXCITEMENT IS I GET A CHANCE TO GIVE SOMETHING BACK MY CHALLENGE IS THE SHORTEST SEMINAR I USUALLY DO IS FIFTY HOURS I'M NOT EXAGGERATING I DO WEEKENDS AND WHAT I DO
TonyRobbins_2006 I'M REALLY IN A POSITION I'M NOT HERE TO MOTIVATE YOU OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T NEED THAT AND A LOT OF TIMES THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE THINK I DO AND IT'S THE FURTHEST THING FROM IT WHAT HAPPENS THOUGH IS PEOPLE SAY TO ME I DON'T NEED ANY MOTIVATION AND I SAY WELL THAT'S INTERESTING THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO I'M THE WHY GUY
TonyRobbins_2006 I WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU DO WHAT YOU DO
TonyRobbins_2006 WHAT IS YOUR MOTIVE FOR ACTION
TonyRobbins_2006 WHAT IS IT THAT DRIVES YOU IN YOUR LIFE TODAY NOT TEN YEARS AGO OR ARE YOU RUNNING THE SAME PATTERN BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE INVISIBLE FORCE OF INTERNAL DRIVE
TonyRobbins_2006 WE CAN I AGREE WITH WHAT WAS DESCRIBED A FEW DAYS AGO ABOUT THIS IDEA THAT PEOPLE WORK IN THEIR SELF INTEREST BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT'S BULLSHIT AT TIMES YOU DON'T WORK IN YOUR SELF INTEREST ALL THE TIME
TonyRobbins_2006 AND TWO SO THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN NOT JUST UNDERSTAND OTHER PEOPLE MORE BUT MAYBE APPRECIATE THEM MORE AND CREATE THE KINDS OF CONNECTIONS THAT CAN STOP SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO GET
TonyRobbins_2006 SO I'VE HAD AN OBSESSION BASICALLY FOR THIRTY YEARS AND THAT OBSESSION HAS BEEN WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF PEOPLES LIVES WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I GOT HIRED TO DO I'VE GOT TO PRODUCE THE RESULT NOW THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE FOR THIRTY YEARS
TonyRobbins_2006 I GET THE PHONE CALL WHEN THE ATHLETE IS BURNING DOWN ON NATIONAL TELEVISION AND THEY WERE AHEAD BY FIVE STROKES AND NOW THEY CAN'T GET BACK ON THE COURSE AND I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW TO GET THE RESULT OR NOTHING MATTERS
TonyRobbins_2006 SO WHEN I GET THOSE CALLS ABOUT PERFORMANCE THAT'S ONE THING HOW DO YOU MAKE A CHANGE BUT ALSO I'M LOOKING TO SEE WHAT IS IT THAT'S SHAPING THAT PERSON 'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE
TonyRobbins_2006 SCIENCE IS EASY RIGHT WE KNOW THE RULES YOU WRITE THE CODE YOU FOLLOW THE AND YOU GET THE RESULTS ONCE YOU KNOW THE GAME YOU JUST YOU KNOW YOU UP THE ANTE DON'T YOU
TonyRobbins_2006 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO FULFILLMENT THAT'S AN ART AND THE REASON IS IT'S ABOUT APPRECIATION AND IT'S ABOUT CONTRIBUTION YOU CAN ONLY FEEL SO MUCH
TonyRobbins_2006 SO I'VE HAD AN INTERESTING LABORATORY TO TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF THE REAL QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN SOMEBODY 'S LIFE IF YOU LOOK AT SOMEBODY LIKE
TonyRobbins_2006 THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOU'VE GIVEN EVERYTHING TO LIKE ALL THE RESOURCES THEY SAY THEY NEED YOU GAVE THEM NOT A ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR COMPUTER YOU GAVE THEM THE BEST COMPUTER YOU GAVE THEM LOVE YOU GAVE THEM JOY YOU WERE THERE TO COMFORT THEM
TonyRobbins_2006 AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE VERY OFTEN AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM I'M SURE END UP THE REST OF THEIR LIFE WITH ALL THIS LOVE EDUCATION MONEY AND BACKGROUND SPENDING THEIR LIFE GOING IN AND
TonyRobbins_2006 THE PAST EQUALS THE FUTURE AND OF COURSE IT DOES IF YOU LIVE THERE BUT WHAT PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM KNOW AND WHAT WE HAVE TO REMIND OURSELVES THOUGH BECAUSE YOU CAN KNOW SOMETHING INTELLECTUALLY YOU CAN KNOW WHAT TO DO AND THEN NOT USE IT NOT APPLY
TonyRobbins_2006 BUT IF YOU ASK PEOPLE WHY DIDN'T YOU ACHIEVE SOMETHING SOMEBODY WHO 'S WORKING FOR YOU YOU KNOW OR A PARTNER OR EVEN YOURSELF WHEN YOU FAIL TO ACHIEVE A GOAL WHAT'S THE REASON PEOPLE SAY THEY FAIL TO ACHIEVE WHAT DO THEY TELL YOU DON'T HAVE THE DIDN'T KNOW ENOUGH DIDN'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE DIDN'T HAVE
TonyRobbins_2006 THEY ARE A CLAIM TO YOU MISSING RESOURCES AND THEY MAY BE ACCURATE YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE MONEY YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE SUPREME COURT BUT THAT IS NOT THE DEFINING FACTOR
TonyRobbins_2006 IF I'M WRONG
TonyRobbins_2006 THE DEFINING FACTOR IS NEVER RESOURCES IT'S RESOURCEFULNESS AND WHAT I MEAN SPECIFICALLY RATHER THAN JUST SOME PHRASE IS IF YOU HAVE EMOTION HUMAN EMOTION
TonyRobbins_2006 HOW EASY FOR ME TO TELL HIM WHAT HE SHOULD DO
TonyRobbins_2006 IDIOT ROBBINS
TonyRobbins_2006 BUT I KNOW WHEN WE WATCHED THE DEBATE AT THAT TIME
TonyRobbins_2006 THERE WERE EMOTIONS THAT BLOCKED PEOPLE 'S ABILITY TO GET THIS MAN 'S INTELLECT AND CAPACITY AND THE WAY THAT IT CAME ACROSS TO SOME PEOPLE ON THAT DAY BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO VOTE IN YOUR DIRECTION AND DIDN 'T AND I WAS UPSET BUT THERE WAS EMOTION THAT WAS THERE HOW MANY KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
TonyRobbins_2006 SO
TonyRobbins_2006 MONEY BUT YOU'RE CREATIVE AND DETERMINED ENOUGH YOU FIND THE WAY SO THIS IS THE ULTIMATE RESOURCE BUR THIS IS NOT THE STORY THAT PEOPLE TELL US RIGHT THE STORY PEOPLE TELL US IS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT STORIES THEY TELL US WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES BUT ULTIMATELY
TonyRobbins_2006 IF YOU TAKE A LOOK HERE FLIP IT UP IF YOU WOULD THEY SAY WHAT ARE ALL THE REASONS THEY HAVEN'T ACCOMPLISHED THAT NEXT ONE PLEASE HE 'S BROKEN MY PATTERN THAT SON OF
TonyRobbins_2006 THE ENERGY
TonyRobbins_2006 GOT TO GIVE IT A MEANING AND WHATEVER THAT MEANING IS PRODUCES EMOTION IS THIS THE END OR THE BEGINNING IS GOD PUNISHING ME OR REWARDING ME OR IS THIS THE ROLL OF THE DICE AN EMOTION THEN CREATES WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO OR THE ACTION
TonyRobbins_2006 SO THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN LIFE THE DECISIONS THAT HAVE SHAPED YOUR DESTINY AND THAT SOUNDS REALLY HEAVY BUT IN THE LAST FIVE OR TEN YEARS FIFTEEN YEARS HOW HAVE THERE BEEN SOME DECISIONS YOU'VE MADE THAT IF YOU'D MADE A DIFFERENT DECISION YOUR LIFE WOULD BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HOW MANY CAN THINK ABOUT IT HONESTLY BETTER OR WORSE
TonyRobbins_2006 I KNOW THE GOOGLE GENIUSES I SAW HERE I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR DECISION WAS TO SELL THEIR TECHNOLOGY AT FIRST WHAT IF THEY MADE THAT DECISION VERSUS TO BUILD THEIR OWN CULTURE HOW WOULD THE WORLD BE DIFFERENT HOW WOULD THEIR LIVES BE DIFFERENT THEIR IMPACT
TonyRobbins_2006 THE HISTORY OF OUR WORLD IS THESE DECISIONS WHEN A WOMAN STANDS UP AND SAYS NO I WON 'T GO TO THE BACK OF THE BUS
TonyRobbins_2006 OR SOMEONE STANDING IN FRONT OF A TANK OR BEING IN A POSITION LIKE LANCE ARMSTRONG AND SOMEONE SAYS TO YOU
TonyRobbins_2006 YOU 'VE GOT TESTICULAR CANCER THAT'S PRETTY TOUGH FOR ANY MALE ESPECIALLY IF YOU RIDE A BIKE YOU'VE GOT IT IN YOUR BRAIN YOU'VE GOT IT IN YOUR LUNGS BUT WHAT WAS HIS DECISION OF WHAT TO FOCUS ON
TonyRobbins_2006 MOST PEOPLE WHAT DID IT MEAN IT WASN'T THE END IT WAS THE BEGINNING WHAT AM I GOING TO DO HE GOES OFF AND WINS SEVEN CHAMPIONSHIPS HE NEVER ONCE WON BEFORE THE CANCER BECAUSE HE GOT EMOTIONAL FITNESS
TonyRobbins_2006 FROM EIGHTY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THAT I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO INTERACT WITH OVER THE LAST TWENTY NINE YEARS AND AFTER A WHILE PATTERNS BECOME OBVIOUS YOU SEE THAT SOUTH AMERICA AND AFRICA MAY BE CONNECTED IN A CERTAIN WAY RIGHT
TonyRobbins_2006 ONE STATE WE ALL HAVE HAD TIME SO IF YOU HAD A TIME YOU DID SOMETHING AND AFTER YOU DID IT YOU THOUGHT TO YOURSELF I CAN'T BELIEVE I SAID THAT I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THAT THAT WAS SO STUPID WHO 'S BEEN
TonyRobbins_2006 STATE YOUR MODEL OF THE WORLD IS WHAT SHAPES YOU LONG TERM YOUR MODEL OF THE WORLD IS THE FILTER
TonyRobbins_2006 SO IT'S NEEDS WE HAVE I BELIEVE THERE ARE SIX HUMAN NEEDS SECOND
TonyRobbins_2006 KNOW WHAT THE TARGET THAT'S DRIVING YOU IS AND YOU UNCOVER IT FOR THE TRUTH YOU DON'T FORM IT YOU UNCOVER IT THEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT'S YOUR MAP WHAT'S THE BELIEF SYSTEMS THAT ARE TELLING YOU HOW TO GET THOSE NEEDS SOME PEOPLE THINK THE WAY TO GET THOSE NEEDS IS DESTROY THE WORLD SOME PEOPLE IS TO BUILD SOMETHING
TonyRobbins_2006 NOW THESE ARE NOT GOALS OR DESIRES THESE ARE UNIVERSAL EVERYONE NEEDS CERTAINTY THAT THEY CAN AVOID PAIN AND AT LEAST BE COMFORTABLE NOW HOW DO YOU GET IT CONTROL EVERYBODY DEVELOP A SKILL GIVE UP SMOKE A CIGARETTE
TonyRobbins_2006 A SECOND HUMAN NEED WHICH IS UNCERTAINTY WE NEED VARIETY WE NEED
TonyRobbins_2006 SIGNIFICANCE WE ALL NEED TO FEEL IMPORTANT SPECIAL UNIQUE YOU CAN GET IT BY MAKING MORE MONEY YOU CAN DO IT BY BEING MORE SPIRITUAL YOU CAN DO IT BY GETTING
TonyRobbins_2006 HOW MUCH UNCERTAINTY WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT KIND OF EXCITING LIKE CLIMBING UP INTO A CAVE AND DOING THAT STUFF ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE TOTAL VARIETY AND UNCERTAINTY AND IT'S SIGNIFICANT ISN'T IT SO YOU WANT TO RISK YOUR LIFE FOR
TonyRobbins_2006 YOU DON'T RAISE YOUR HAND YOU'LL HAVE HAD OTHER SHIT TOO COME ON
TonyRobbins_2006 NOW THESE FIRST FOUR NEEDS EVERY HUMAN FINDS A WAY TO MEET EVEN IF YOU LIE TO YOURSELF YOU NEED TO HAVE SPLIT PERSONALITIES BUT THE LAST TWO NEEDS THE FIRST FOUR NEEDS ARE CALLED THE NEEDS OF THE PERSONALITIES IS WHAT I CALL IT THE LAST TWO ARE THE NEEDS OF THE SPIRIT
TonyRobbins_2006 WE ALL KNOW LIFE 'S NOT ABOUT ME IT'S ABOUT WE THIS CULTURE KNOWS THAT THIS ROOM KNOWS THAT AND IT'S EXCITING WHEN YOU SEE NICHOLAS UP HERE TALKING ABOUT HIS ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR COMPUTER THE MOST PASSIONATE EXCITING THING IS HERE 'S A GENIUS BUT HE 'S GOT A CALLING NOW
TonyRobbins_2006 YOU CAN FEEL THE DIFFERENCE IN HIM AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND THAT CALLING CAN TOUCH OTHER PEOPLE IN MY OWN LIFE MY LIFE WAS TOUCHED BECAUSE WHEN I WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD
TonyRobbins_2006 I SAID FOCUS ON THERE 'S FOOD WHAT A CONCEPT YOU KNOW SECOND BUT THIS IS WHAT CHANGED MY LIFE THIS IS WHAT SHAPED ME AS A HUMAN BEING SOMEBODY 'S GIFT I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO IT IS MY FATHER ALWAYS SAID NO ONE
TonyRobbins_2006 BROWNIE POINTS BUT AFTER EIGHT I THOUGHT SHIT I COULD USE SOME HELP SO SURE ENOUGH I WENT OUT AND WHAT DID I DO I GOT MY FRIENDS
TonyRobbins_2006 ELEVEN COMPANIES AND I BUILT THE FOUNDATION NOW EIGHTEEN YEARS LATER I'M PROUD TO TELL YOU LAST YEAR WE FED TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN THIRTY FIVE COUNTRIES THROUGH OUR FOUNDATION ALL DURING THE HOLIDAYS THANKSGIVING CHRISTMAS
TonyRobbins_2006 I DON'T TELL YOU THAT TO BRAG I TELL YOU BECAUSE I'M PROUD OF HUMAN BEINGS BECAUSE THEY GET EXCITED TO CONTRIBUTE ONCE THEY'VE HAD THE CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE IT NOT TALK ABOUT
TonyRobbins_2006 SO FINALLY AND I'M ABOUT OUT OF TIME THE TARGET THAT SHAPES YOU HERE 'S WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT PEOPLE WE HAVE THE SAME NEEDS BUT ARE YOU A CERTAINTY FREAK IS THAT WHAT YOU VALUE MOST OR UNCERTAINTY
TonyRobbins_2006 THIS MAN HERE COULDN'T BE A CERTAINTY FREAK IF HE CLIMBED THROUGH THOSE CAVES ARE YOU DRIVEN BY SIGNIFICANCE OR LOVE WE ALL NEED ALL SIX BUT WHATEVER YOUR LEAD SYSTEM IS TILTS YOU IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND AS YOU MOVE IN A DIRECTION YOU HAVE A DESTINATION OR DESTINY
TonyRobbins_2006 SAVE LIVES EVEN IF I DIE FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY'RE FIREMEN SOMEBODY ELSE IS I 'M GOING TO KILL PEOPLE TO DO IT THEY'RE TRYING TO MEET THE SAME NEEDS OF SIGNIFICANCE RIGHT THEY WANT
TonyRobbins_2006 A LONG TIME IS ONE HUNDRED YEARS SOMEBODY ELSE'S IS THREE SECONDS WHICH IS WHAT I HAVE
TonyRobbins_2006 THE LAST ONE I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT FELL TO YOU IF YOU'VE GOT A TARGET AND YOU'VE GOT A MAP AND LET 'S SAY I CAN'T USE GOOGLE BECAUSE I LOVE MACS AND THEY HAVEN'T MADE IT GOOD FOR MACS YET SO IF YOU USE MAPQUEST HOW MANY HAVE MADE THIS FATAL MISTAKE OF USING
TonyRobbins_2006 THIS THING AND YOU DON'T GET THERE WELL IMAGINE IF YOUR BELIEFS GUARANTEE YOU CAN NEVER GET TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO
TonyRobbins_2006 LAST THING IS EMOTION NOW HERE 'S WHAT I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT EMOTION THERE ARE SIX THOUSAND EMOTIONS THAT WE ALL HAVE WORDS FOR IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE WHICH IS JUST A LINGUISTIC REPRESENTATION RIGHT THAT CHANGES BY LANGUAGE BUT
TonyRobbins_2006 IF YOUR DOMINANT EMOTIONS IF I HAD MORE TIME I HAVE TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE OR ONE THOUSAND AND I HAVE THEM WRITE DOWN ALL THE EMOTIONS THAT THEY EXPERIENCE IN AN AVERAGE WEEK
TonyRobbins_2006 SO THEY GOT FIVE OR SIX GOOD FRICKING FEELINGS RIGHT IT'S LIKE THEY FEEL HAPPY HAPPY EXCITED OH SHIT FRUSTRATED FRUSTRATED OVERWHELMED DEPRESSED HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS FINDS A WAY TO GET PISSED OFF
TonyRobbins_2006 NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS THEY FIND A WAY TO BE HAPPY OR
TonyRobbins_2006 THIS I WAS IN HAWAII I WAS WITH TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE FROM FORTY FIVE COUNTRIES WE WERE TRANSLATING FOUR LANGUAGES SIMULTANEOUSLY FOR A PROGRAM THAT I WAS CONDUCTING FOR A WEEK
TonyRobbins_2006 ONE WOMAN WELL THAT NIGHT IS WHEN NINE ELEVEN HAPPENED ONE WOMAN HAD COME TO THE SEMINAR AND WHEN SHE CAME THERE HER PREVIOUS BOYFRIEND HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED AND MURDERED
TonyRobbins_2006 HER FRIEND HER NEW BOYFRIEND WANTED TO MARRY HER AND SHE SAID NO HE SAID IF YOU LEAVE AND GO TO THAT HAWAII THING IT'S OVER WITH US SHE SAID IT 'S OVER WHEN I FINISHED THAT NIGHT SHE CALLED HIM AND LEFT A MESSAGE TRUE STORY AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD TRADE
TonyRobbins_2006 SHE FINISHES AND A MAN STANDS UP AND HE SAYS I 'M FROM PAKISTAN I'M A MUSLIM I'D LOVE TO HOLD YOUR HAND AND SAY I'M SORRY BUT FRANKLY THIS IS RETRIBUTION
TonyRobbins_2006 THIRTY FRIENDS CROSSING OFF THAT ALL DIED AND WHAT I DID TO PEOPLE IS SAID WHAT ARE WE GOING TO FOCUS ON
TonyRobbins_2006 I SAID DO YOU ALWAYS GET ANGRY SHE SAID YES GUILTY PEOPLE GOT GUILTY SAD PEOPLE GOT SAD AND I TOOK THESE TWO MEN AND DID WHAT I CALL AN INDIRECT NEGOTIATION JEWISH MAN WITH FAMILY IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORY SOMEONE IN NEW YORK WHO WOULD HAVE DIED IF HE WAS AT WORK THAT DAY
TonyRobbins_2006 BUT THE TWO OF THEM NOT ONLY CAME TOGETHER AND CHANGED THEIR BELIEFS AND MORALS OF THE WORLD BUT THEY WORKED TOGETHER TO BRING FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS NOW
TonyRobbins_2006 THE WEB IN HERE THE NEEDS THE BELIEFS THE EMOTIONS THAT ARE CONTROLLING YOU FOR TWO REASONS SO THERE'S MORE OF YOU TO GIVE AND ACHIEVE TOO WE ALL WANT TO
