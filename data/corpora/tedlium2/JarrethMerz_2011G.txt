JarrethMerz_2011G@13.46:15.52 BORN IN SWITZERLAND
JarrethMerz_2011G@16.02:18.57 AND RAISED IN GHANA WEST AFRICA
JarrethMerz_2011G@30.56:37.59 BUT THEN BY THE END OF THE DECADE THE COUNTRY HAD FALLEN BACK INTO POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND MISMANAGEMENT
JarrethMerz_2011G@41.13:44.05 MY FIRST MILITARY COUP
JarrethMerz_2011G@45.04:50.13 WE THE CHILDREN HAD GATHERED AT A FRIEND 'S HOUSE IT WAS A DIMLY LIT SHACK
JarrethMerz_2011G@59.38:61.15 AND TIED TO THE POLE
JarrethMerz_2011G@61.72:68.22 THE FIRING SQUAD AIMED FIRED THE GENERAL WAS DEAD NOW THIS WAS BEING BROADCAST LIVE
JarrethMerz_2011G@68.87:70.94 AND SHORTLY AFTER
JarrethMerz_2011G@71.3:74.03 WE LEFT THE COUNTRY AND WE RETURNED TO SWITZERLAND
JarrethMerz_2011G@74.73:89.17 NOW EUROPE CAME AS A SHOCK TO ME AND I THINK I STARTED FEELING THE NEED TO SHED MY SKIN IN ORDER TO FIT IN I WANTED TO BLEND IN LIKE A CHAMELEON I THINK IT WAS A TACTIC OF SURVIVAL AND IT WORKED
JarrethMerz_2011G@89.8:91.51 OR SO I BELIEVED
JarrethMerz_2011G@91.72:98.53 SO HERE I WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WONDERING WHERE I WAS IN MY LIFE
JarrethMerz_2011G@99.18:101.77 AND I FELT I WAS BEING TYPECAST AS AN ACTOR
JarrethMerz_2011G@101.86:107.69 I WAS ALWAYS PLAYING THE EXOTIC AFRICAN I WAS PLAYING THE VIOLENT AFRICAN
JarrethMerz_2011G@107.69:114.97 THE AFRICAN TERRORIST AND I WAS THINKING HOW MANY TERRORISTS COULD I POSSIBLY PLAY BEFORE TURNING INTO ONE MYSELF
JarrethMerz_2011G@119.16:121.36 THE AFRICAN IN ME
JarrethMerz_2011G@123.07:139.76 AND FORTUNATELY I DECIDED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT TO RETURN TO GHANA AFTER TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF ABSENCE I WANTED TO DOCUMENT ON FILM THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND THERE I STARTED BY SEARCHING FOR THE FOOTPRINTS IN MY CHILDHOOD
JarrethMerz_2011G@148.38:156.18 AND I REALIZED THAT WHEN I 'D LEFT THE COUNTRY FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS IN A DEMOCRATIC ENVIRONMENT WERE A DREAM
JarrethMerz_2011G@165.21:171.74 LIKE I WAS LOOKING FOR MY IDENTITY WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN GHANA A METAPHOR FOR WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN ME
JarrethMerz_2011G@184.09:192.48 EVEN THOUGH WE HAD BEEN TRYING VERY HARD NOW IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN GHANA WAS THE FIRST SUB SAHARAN COUNTRY TO GAIN ITS INDEPENDENCE
JarrethMerz_2011G@192.57:202.03 IN THE LATE FIFTY S GHANA AND SINGAPORE HAD THE SAME GDP I MEAN TODAY SINGAPORE IS A FIRST WORLD COUNTRY AND GHANA IS NOT
JarrethMerz_2011G@202.65:205.29 BUT MAYBE IT WAS TIME
JarrethMerz_2011G@205.39:209.38 TO PROVE TO MYSELF YES IT 'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE PAST IT IS
JarrethMerz_2011G@209.58:215.8 IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT IT IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE STRENGTHS IN OUR OWN CULTURE
JarrethMerz_2011G@216.19:219.47 AND BUILD ON THOSE FOUNDATIONS IN THE PRESENT
JarrethMerz_2011G@220.15:223.87 SO HERE I WAS DECEMBER SEVENTH TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
JarrethMerz_2011G@225:229.5 THE POLLING STATIONS OPENED TO THE VOTERS AT SEVEN ZERO AM
JarrethMerz_2011G@229.86:234.29 BUT VOTERS EAGER TO TAKE THEIR OWN POLITICAL FATE INTO THEIR HANDS
JarrethMerz_2011G@234.67:247.78 WERE STARTING TO LINE UP AT FOUR ZERO AM IN THE MORNING AND THEY HAD TRAVELED FROM NEAR THEY HAD TRAVELED FROM FAR BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD AND I ASKED ONE OF THE VOTERS I SAID WHOM ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR AND HE SAID I 'M SORRY I CAN 'T TELL YOU
JarrethMerz_2011G@248.23:254.06 HE SAID THAT HIS VOTE WAS IN HIS HEART AND I UNDERSTOOD THIS WAS THEIR ELECTION
JarrethMerz_2011G@254.44:257.43 AND THEY WEREN 'T GOING TO LET ANYONE TAKE IT AWAY FROM THEM
JarrethMerz_2011G@258.24:277.23 NOW THE FIRST ROUND OF THE VOTING DIDN 'T BRING FORTH A CLEAR WINNER SO NOBODY HAD ACHIEVED THE ABSOLUTE MAJORITY SO VOTING WENT INTO A SECOND ROUND THREE WEEKS LATER THE CANDIDATES WERE BACK ON THE ROAD THEY WERE CAMPAIGNING THE RHETORIC OF THE CANDIDATES OF COURSE CHANGED THE HEAT WAS ON AND THEN
JarrethMerz_2011G@277.9:279.92 THE CLICHE CAME TO HAUNT US
JarrethMerz_2011G@284.12:286.57 OF BALLOT BOXES BEING STOLEN
JarrethMerz_2011G@287.99:290.58 INFLATED RESULTS STARTED COMING IN
JarrethMerz_2011G@306.28:311.84 AND MY HEART SANK BECAUSE I THOUGHT HERE WE ARE AGAIN HERE IS ANOTHER PROOF
JarrethMerz_2011G@311.85:315.32 THAT THE AFRICAN IS NOT CAPABLE OF GOVERNING HIMSELF
JarrethMerz_2011G@315.96:321.41 AND NOT ONLY THAT I AM DOCUMENTING IT DOCUMENTING MY OWN CULTURAL SHORTCOMINGS
JarrethMerz_2011G@322.21:326.59 SO WHEN THE ECHO OF THE GUNSHOTS HAD LINGERED
JarrethMerz_2011G@327.35:331.99 IT WAS SOON DROWNED BY THE CHANTING OF THE MOB AND I DIDN 'T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS HEARING THEY WERE CHANTING
JarrethMerz_2011G@331.99:333.73 WE WANT PEACE
JarrethMerz_2011G@333.76:336 WE WANT PEACE
JarrethMerz_2011G@336.67:339.07 AND I REALIZED IT HAD TO COME FROM THE PEOPLE
JarrethMerz_2011G@349.97:353.15 THE SOUNDS OF THE VOICES WERE HARMONIOUS
JarrethMerz_2011G@359.7:369.91 IT COULD BE BY THE WILL OF THE MASSES WHO WERE NOW URGENTLY PRESSING WITH ALL THEIR HEART AND ALL THEIR WILL FOR PEACE NOW HERE 'S AN INTERESTING
JarrethMerz_2011G@374.77:378.19 THE VALUES THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF DEMOCRACY
JarrethMerz_2011G@378.36:381.16 THAT WE ARE THE SHINING EXAMPLE OF HOW IT 'S DONE
JarrethMerz_2011G@381.8:383.45 BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT
JarrethMerz_2011G@388.08:403.98 IN WHICH THE U S ELECTION STALLED IN THE TWO THOUSAND PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS BUSH VERSUS GORE BUT INSTEAD OF THE UNWILLINGNESS OF THE CANDIDATES TO ALLOW THE SYSTEM TO PROCEED AND THE PEOPLE TO DECIDE GHANA HONORED DEMOCRACY
JarrethMerz_2011G@421.24:426.14 DECLARED WITH THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO RUN AN UNPRECEDENTED
JarrethMerz_2011G@443.1:454.12 GAVE UP POWER AND MADE WAY FOR GHANA TO MOVE INTO A NEW DEMOCRATIC CYCLE I MEAN AT THE ABSOLUTE TIME FOR THE ABSOLUTE NEED OF DEMOCRACY THEY DID NOT ABUSE THEIR POWER
JarrethMerz_2011G@455.8:458.54 THE BELIEF IN TRUE DEMOCRACY
JarrethMerz_2011G@458.82:463.86 AND IN THE PEOPLE RUNS DEEP PROVING THAT THE AFRICAN IS CAPABLE OF GOVERNING HIMSELF
JarrethMerz_2011G@464.59:469.1 NOW THE UPHILL BATTLE FOR GHANA AND FOR AFRICA IS NOT OVER
JarrethMerz_2011G@469.83:476.86 BUT I HAVE PROOF THAT THE OTHER SIDE OF DEMOCRACY EXISTS AND THAT WE MUST NOT TAKE IT FOR GRANTED
JarrethMerz_2011G@477.7:486.64 NOW I HAVE LEARNED THAT MY PLACE IS NOT JUST IN THE WEST OR IN AFRICA AND I 'M STILL SEARCHING FOR MY IDENTITY
JarrethMerz_2011G@494.3:498.13 TO LOOK AT PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY AND TO LOOK AT MYSELF DIFFERENTLY
