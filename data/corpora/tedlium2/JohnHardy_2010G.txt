JohnHardy_2010G@16.54:24.97 I GREW UP IN A VERY SMALL VILLAGE IN CANADA AND I'M AN UNDIAGNOSED DYSLEXIC
JohnHardy_2010G@26.11:35.53 I HAD A REALLY HARD TIME IN SCHOOL IN FACT MY MOTHER TOLD ME EVENTUALLY THAT I WAS THE LITTLE KID IN THE VILLAGE WHO CRIED ALL THE WAY TO SCHOOL
JohnHardy_2010G@38.40:39.26 I RAN AWAY
JohnHardy_2010G@40.44:48.84 LEFT WHEN I WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD TO GO TO BALI AND THERE I MET MY INCREDIBLE WIFE CYNTHIA
JohnHardy_2010G@49.35:61.63 AND TOGETHER OVER TWENTY YEARS WE BUILT AN AMAZING JEWELRY BUSINESS IT WAS A FAIRY TALE AND THEN WE RETIRED THEN SHE TOOK ME TO SEE A FILM THAT I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO SEE IT
JohnHardy_2010G@63.33:65.61 MY LIFE
JohnHardy_2010G@72.84:75.60 AND EVEN IF PART OF WHAT HE SAYS IS TRUE
JohnHardy_2010G@76.43:88.47 THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE LIFE THAT I HAD AND I DECIDED AT THAT MOMENT THAT I WOULD SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE DOING WHATEVER I COULD
JohnHardy_2010G@89.35:96.82 TO IMPROVE THEIR POSSIBILITIES SO HERE 'S THE WORLD AND HERE WE ARE IN BALI
JohnHardy_2010G@99.02:107.32 LITTLE ISLAND SIXTY MILES BY NINETY MILES IT HAS AN INTACT HINDU CULTURE CYNTHIA AND I WERE THERE WE HAD HAD
JohnHardy_2010G@107.89:114.44 A WONDERFUL LIFE THERE AND WE DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING UNUSUAL WE DECIDED TO GIVE
JohnHardy_2010G@115.12:122.85 BACK LOCALLY AND HERE IT IS IT'S CALLED THE GREEN SCHOOL I KNOW IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A SCHOOL
JohnHardy_2010G@123.37:131.56 BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE DECIDED TO DO AND IT IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY GREEN THE CLASSROOMS
JohnHardy_2010G@131.87:139.27 HAVE NO WALLS THE TEACHER IS WRITING ON A BAMBOO BLACKBOARD THE DESKS ARE NOT SQUARE
JohnHardy_2010G@139.79:148.24 AT GREEN SCHOOL THE CHILDREN ARE SMILING AN UNUSUAL THING FOR SCHOOL ESPECIALLY FOR ME AND WE PRACTICE HOLISM
JohnHardy_2010G@157.65:162.48 WORLD A WHOLE WORLD TO LIVE ON
JohnHardy_2010G@162.79:175.81 OUR CHILDREN SPEND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE DAYS GOING TO SCHOOL IN A BOX THE PEOPLE THAT BUILT MY SCHOOL ALSO BUILT THE PRISON AND THE INSANE ASYLUM OUT OF THE SAME MATERIALS
JohnHardy_2010G@178.57:182.89 SO IF THIS GENTLEMAN HAD HAVE HAD A HOLISTIC EDUCATION
JohnHardy_2010G@183.52:194.02 WOULD HE BE SITTING THERE WOULD HE HAVE HAD MORE POSSIBILITIES IN HIS LIFE THE CLASSROOMS HAVE NATURAL LIGHT THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL THEY'RE BAMBOO
JohnHardy_2010G@194.52:205.79 THE BREEZE PASSES THROUGH THEM AND WHEN THE NATURAL BREEZE ISN'T ENOUGH THE KIDS DEPLOY BUBBLES BUT NOT THE KIND OF BUBBLES YOU KNOW THESE BUBBLES ARE MADE FROM NATURAL COTTON
JohnHardy_2010G@206.10:213.86 AND RUBBER FROM THE RUBBER TREE SO WE BASICALLY TURNED THE BOX INTO A BUBBLE AND THESE KIDS KNOW
JohnHardy_2010G@215.46:222.28 PAINLESS CLIMATE CONTROL MAY NOT BE PART OF THEIR FUTURE
JohnHardy_2010G@223.26:235.38 WE PAY THE BILL AT THE END OF THE MONTH BUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY GOING TO PAY THE BILL ARE OUR GRANDCHILDREN WE HAVE TO TEACH THE KIDS THAT THE WORLD IS NOT INDESTRUCTIBLE
JohnHardy_2010G@236.52:245.44 THESE KIDS DID A LITTLE GRAFFITI ON THEIR DESKS AND THEN THEY SIGNED UP FOR TWO EXTRA COURSES THE FIRST ONE WAS CALLED SANDING
JohnHardy_2010G@246.62:248.65 AND THE SECOND ONE WAS CALLED RE WAXING
JohnHardy_2010G@250.19:258.17 BUT SINCE THAT HAPPENED THEY OWN THOSE DESKS THEY KNOW THEY CAN CONTROL THEIR WORLD
JohnHardy_2010G@259.17:260.93 WE'RE ON THE GRID WE'RE NOT PROUD OF IT
JohnHardy_2010G@261.96:269.05 BUT AN AMAZING ALTERNATIVE ENERGY COMPANY IN PARIS IS TAKING US OFF THE GRID WITH SOLAR AND THIS THING
JohnHardy_2010G@269.84:281.79 IS THE SECOND VORTEX TO BE BUILT IN THE WORLD IN A TWO AND A HALF METER DROP ON A RIVER WHEN THE TURBINE DROPS IN IT WILL PRODUCE EIGHT THOUSAND WATTS OF ELECTRICITY DAY AND NIGHT
JohnHardy_2010G@282.52:294.68 AND YOU KNOW WHAT THESE ARE THERE'S NOWHERE TO FLUSH AND AS LONG AS WE'RE TAKING OUR WASTE AND MIXING IT WITH A HUGE AMOUNT OF WATER YOU'RE ALL REALLY SMART JUST DO THE MATH HOW MANY PEOPLE TIMES HOW MUCH WATER
JohnHardy_2010G@295.42:303.97 THERE ISN'T ENOUGH WATER THESE ARE COMPOST TOILETS AND NOBODY AT THE SCHOOL WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT THEM ESPECIALLY THE PRINCIPAL
JohnHardy_2010G@305.17:312.45 AND THEY WORK PEOPLE USE THEM PEOPLE ARE OKAY IT'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT DOING NOT
JohnHardy_2010G@313.07:323.24 MANY THINGS DIDN'T WORK THE BEAUTIFUL CANVAS AND RUBBER SKYLIGHTS GOT EATEN BY THE SUN IN SIX MONTHS WE HAD TO REPLACE THEM WITH RECYCLABLE PLASTIC
JohnHardy_2010G@323.98:338.18 THE TEACHERS DRAGGED GIANT PVC WHITEBOARDS INTO THE CLASSROOMS SO WE HAD SOME GOOD IDEAS WE TOOK OLD AUTOMOBILE WINDSHIELDS PUT PAPER BEHIND THEM AND CREATED THE FIRST ALTERNATIVE TO THE WHITEBOARD
JohnHardy_2010G@339.44:345.54 GREEN SCHOOL SITS IN SOUTH CENTRAL BALI AND IT'S ON TWENTY ACRES OF ROLLING
JohnHardy_2010G@355.11:362.04 I MET A FATHER THE OTHER DAY HE LOOKED A LITTLE CRAZED I SAID WELCOME TO GREEN SCHOOL HE SAID I 'VE BEEN ON AN AIRPLANE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS
JohnHardy_2010G@363.77:364.48 I ASKED HIM
JohnHardy_2010G@366.74:376.46 WHY HE SAID I HAD A DREAM ONCE ABOUT A GREEN SCHOOL AND I SAW A PICTURE OF THIS GREEN SCHOOL I GOT ON AN AIRPLANE IN AUGUST I'M BRINGING MY SONS
JohnHardy_2010G@377.62:383.60 THIS WAS A GREAT THING BUT MORE THAN THAT PEOPLE ARE BUILDING GREEN HOUSES AROUND GREEN SCHOOL
JohnHardy_2010G@383.92:391.76 SO THEIR KIDS CAN WALK TO SCHOOL ON THE PATHS AND PEOPLE ARE BRINGING THEIR GREEN INDUSTRIES HOPEFULLY THEIR GREEN RESTAURANTS
JohnHardy_2010G@392.36:399.95 TO THE GREEN SCHOOL IT'S BECOMING A COMMUNITY IT'S BECOMING A GREEN MODEL WE HAD TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING
JohnHardy_2010G@401.20:408.64 NO PETROCHEMICALS IN THE PAVEMENT NO PAVEMENT THESE ARE VOLCANIC STONES LAID BY HAND THERE ARE NO SIDEWALKS
JohnHardy_2010G@409.20:415.75 THE SIDEWALKS ARE GRAVEL THEY FLOOD WHEN IT RAINS BUT THEY'RE GREEN THIS IS THE SCHOOL BUFFALO
JohnHardy_2010G@417.67:426.52 HE 'S PLANNING TO EAT THAT FENCE FOR DINNER ALL THE FENCES AT GREEN SCHOOL ARE GREEN AND WHEN THE KINDERGARTEN KIDS RECENTLY MOVED THEIR GATE
JohnHardy_2010G@426.89:437.24 THEY FOUND OUT THE FENCE WAS MADE OUT OF TAPIOCA THEY TOOK THE TAPIOCA ROOTS UP TO THE KITCHEN SLICED THEM THINLY AND MADE DELICIOUS CHIPS LANDSCAPING
JohnHardy_2010G@438.61:451.31 WE MANAGE TO KEEP THE GARDEN THAT WAS THERE RUNNING RIGHT UP TO THE EDGE OF EACH OF THE CLASSROOMS WE DROPPED THEM GENTLY IN WE MADE SPACE FOR THESE GUYS WHO ARE BALI 'S LAST BLACK PIGS
JohnHardy_2010G@452.68:453.36 AND THE SCHOOL
JohnHardy_2010G@455.14:459.89 IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REPLACE THE LAWNMOWER ON THE PLAYING FIELD
JohnHardy_2010G@461.69:473.83 THESE YOUNG LADIES ARE LIVING IN A RICE CULTURE BUT THEY KNOW SOMETHING THAT FEW PEOPLE KNOW IN A RICE CULTURE THEY KNOW HOW TO PLANT ORGANIC RICE THEY KNOW HOW TO LOOK AFTER IT THEY KNOW HOW TO HARVEST AND THEY KNOW HOW TO COOK IT
JohnHardy_2010G@474.60:487.31 THEY'RE PART OF THE RICE CYCLE AND THESE SKILLS WILL BE VALUABLE FOR THEM IN THEIR FUTURE THIS YOUNG MAN IS PICKING ORGANIC VEGETABLES WE FEED FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE LUNCH EVERY DAY
JohnHardy_2010G@487.85:499.25 AND IT'S NOT A NORMAL LUNCH THERE'S NO GAS LOCAL BALINESE WOMEN COOK THE FOOD ON SAWDUST BURNERS USING SECRETS THAT ONLY THEIR GRANDMOTHERS KNOW
JohnHardy_2010G@499.91:507.97 THE FOOD IS INCREDIBLE GREEN SCHOOL IS A PLACE OF PIONEERS LOCAL AND GLOBAL
JohnHardy_2010G@508.35:517.35 AND IT'S A KIND OF MICROCOSM OF THE GLOBALIZED WORLD THE KIDS ARE FROM TWENTY FIVE COUNTRIES WHEN I SEE THEM TOGETHER I KNOW
JohnHardy_2010G@518.02:525.46 THAT THEY'RE WORKING OUT HOW TO LIVE IN THE FUTURE GREEN SCHOOL IS GOING INTO ITS THIRD YEAR WITH ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY CHILDREN
JohnHardy_2010G@526.07:536.72 IT'S A SCHOOL WHERE YOU DO LEARN READING ONE OF MY FAVORITES WRITING I WAS BAD AT IT ARITHMETIC BUT YOU ALSO LEARN OTHER THINGS YOU LEARN BAMBOO BUILDING
JohnHardy_2010G@537.45:547.87 YOU PRACTICE ANCIENT BALINESE ARTS THIS IS CALLED MUD WRESTLING IN THE RICE FIELDS THE KIDS LOVE IT THE MOTHERS AREN'T QUITE CONVINCED
JohnHardy_2010G@551.40:559.84 A LOT OF OUTRAGEOUS THINGS IN OUR LIVES AND WE SAID OKAY LOCAL WHAT DOES LOCAL MEAN LOCAL MEANS THAT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION OF THE SCHOOL HAS TO
JohnHardy_2010G@570.78:581.22 TO SUPPORT THE BALINESE SCHOLARSHIP FUND BECAUSE THESE KIDS WILL BE BALI 'S NEXT GREEN LEADERS THE TEACHERS ARE AS DIVERSE AS THE STUDENT BODY
JohnHardy_2010G@581.72:592.10 AND THE AMAZING THING IS THAT VOLUNTEERS ARE POPPING UP A MAN CAME FROM JAVA WITH A NEW KIND OF ORGANIC AGRICULTURE A WOMAN CAME FROM AFRICA WITH MUSIC
JohnHardy_2010G@593.13:602.19 AND TOGETHER THESE VOLUNTEERS AND THE TEACHERS ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO CREATING A NEW GENERATION OF GLOBAL GREEN LEADERS
JohnHardy_2010G@604.21:612.89 THE GREEN SCHOOL EFFECT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS WE NEED SOMEONE TO COME AND STUDY IT BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING OUR LEARNING DIFFERENT KIDS
JohnHardy_2010G@613.43:620.19 DYSLEXIC WE'VE RENAMED THEM PROLEXIC ARE DOING WELL IN THESE BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL
JohnHardy_2010G@632.42:642.79 IT COMES OUT OF THE GROUND LIKE A TRAIN IT GROWS AS HIGH AS A COCONUT TREE IN TWO MONTHS AND THREE YEARS LATER IT CAN BE HARVESTED TO BUILD BUILDINGS LIKE THIS
JohnHardy_2010G@643.09:650.53 IT'S AS STRONG AND DENSE AS TEAK AND IT WILL HOLD UP ANY ROOF
JohnHardy_2010G@651.03:658.84 THE ARCHITECTS CAME THEY BROUGHT US THESE THINGS AND YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN THINGS LIKE THIS THE YELLOW BOX WAS CALLED THE ADMINISTRATION COMPLEX
JohnHardy_2010G@661.30:667.97 WE SQUASHED IT WE RETHOUGHT IT BUT MAINLY WE RENAMED IT THE HEART OF SCHOOL
JohnHardy_2010G@668.46:676.51 AND THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING FOREVER IT'S A DOUBLE HELIX IT HAS ADMINISTRATORS IN IT AND MANY MANY OTHER THINGS
JohnHardy_2010G@677.22:687.56 AND THE PROBLEM OF BUILDING IT WHEN THE BALINESE WORKERS SAW LONG REAMS OF PLANS THEY LOOKED AT THEM AND SAID WHAT 'S THIS SO WE BUILT
JohnHardy_2010G@688.27:696.28 BIG MODELS WE HAD THEM ENGINEERED BY THE ENGINEERS AND BALINESE CARPENTERS LIKE THIS MEASURED THEM WITH THEIR BAMBOO RULERS
JohnHardy_2010G@696.82:705.29 SELECTED THE BAMBOO AND BUILT THE BUILDINGS USING AGE OLD TECHNIQUES MOSTLY BY HAND
JohnHardy_2010G@706.23:720.07 IT WAS CHAOS AND THE BALINESE CARPENTERS WANT TO BE AS MODERN AS WE DO SO THEY USE METAL SCAFFOLDING TO BUILD THE BAMBOO BUILDING AND WHEN THE SCAFFOLDING CAME DOWN
JohnHardy_2010G@722.78:730.77 WE REALIZED THAT WE HAD A CATHEDRAL A CATHEDRAL TO GREEN AND A CATHEDRAL GREEN EDUCATION THE
JohnHardy_2010G@731.49:739.48 HAS SEVEN KILOMETERS OF BAMBOO IN IT FROM THE TIME THE FOUNDATIONS WERE FINISHED IN THREE MONTHS IT HAD ROOFS AND FLOORS
JohnHardy_2010G@739.94:746.91 IT MAY NOT BE THE BIGGEST BAMBOO BUILDING IN THE WORLD BUT MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
JohnHardy_2010G@747.71:755.73 IS THIS DOABLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY WE BELIEVE IT IS GREEN SCHOOL IS A MODEL WE BUILT FOR THE WORLD
JohnHardy_2010G@756.40:767.28 IT'S A MODEL WE BUILT FOR BALI AND YOU JUST HAVE TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE SIMPLE RULES BE LOCAL LET THE ENVIRONMENT LEAD AND THINK ABOUT HOW YOUR
JohnHardy_2010G@767.97:773.54 GRANDCHILDREN MIGHT BUILD SO MISTER GORE
