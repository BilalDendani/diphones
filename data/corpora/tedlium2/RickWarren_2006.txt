RickWarren_2006 I'M OFTEN ASKED
RickWarren_2006 YOU KNOW WHAT SURPRISES YOU ABOUT THE BOOK AND I SAID THAT I GOT TO WRITE IT I WOULD HAVE NEVER IMAGINED THAT NOT IN MY WILDEST DREAMS DID I THINK I DON'T EVEN CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE AN AUTHOR
RickWarren_2006 AND
RickWarren_2006 I'M OFTEN ASKED WHY DO YOU THINK SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE READ THIS THIS THING 'S SELLING STILL ABOUT A MILLION COPIES A MONTH
RickWarren_2006 AND
RickWarren_2006 I THINK IT'S BECAUSE SPIRITUAL EMPTINESS IS A UNIVERSAL DISEASE I THINK INSIDE AT SOME POINT WE PUT OUR HEADS DOWN ON THE PILLOW AND WE GO THERE 'S GOT TO BE MORE TO LIFE THAN THIS
RickWarren_2006 GET UP IN THE MORNING GO TO WORK COME HOME AND WATCH TV GO TO BED GET UP IN THE MORNING GO TO WORK COME HOME WATCH TV GO TO BED GO TO PARTIES ON WEEKENDS A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY I 'M LIVING NO YOU'RE NOT LIVING THAT'S JUST EXISTING
RickWarren_2006 I REALLY THINK THAT'S THERE'S THIS INNER DESIRE
RickWarren_2006 I DO BELIEVE WHAT CHRIS SAID I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE NOT AN ACCIDENT
RickWarren_2006 YOUR PARENTS MAY NOT HAVE PLANNED YOU BUT I BELIEVE GOD DID I THINK THERE ARE ACCIDENTAL PARENTS THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT I DON'T THINK THERE ARE ACCIDENTAL KIDS
RickWarren_2006 AND I THINK YOU MATTER
RickWarren_2006 I THINK YOU MATTER TO GOD I THINK YOU MATTER TO HISTORY I THINK YOU MATTER TO THIS UNIVERSE
RickWarren_2006 AND I THINK THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT I CALL THE SURVIVAL LEVEL OF LIVING THE SUCCESS LEVEL OF LIVING AND THE SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF LIVING IS
RickWarren_2006 DO YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT ON EARTH AM I HERE FOR
RickWarren_2006 I MEET A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY SMART AND SAY BUT WHY CAN'T I FIGURE OUT MY PROBLEMS AND I MEET A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL WHO SAY WHY DON'T I FEEL MORE FULFILLED WHY DO I FEEL LIKE A FAKE
RickWarren_2006 WHY DO I FEEL LIKE
RickWarren_2006 I'VE GOT TO PRETEND THAT I'M MORE THAN I REALLY AM I THINK THAT COMES DOWN TO THIS ISSUE OF MEANING OF SIGNIFICANCE OF PURPOSE I THINK IT COMES DOWN TO THIS ISSUE OF WHY AM I HERE WHAT AM I HERE FOR
RickWarren_2006 WHERE AM I GOING THESE ARE NOT RELIGIOUS ISSUES
RickWarren_2006 HUMAN ISSUES I WANTED TO TELL MICHAEL BEFORE HE SPOKE
RickWarren_2006 THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT HE DOES BECAUSE IT MAKES MY LIFE WORK A WHOLE LOT EASIER AS A PASTOR I DO SEE A LOT OF KOOKS AND I HAVE LEARNED THAT THERE ARE KOOKS IN EVERY AREA OF LIFE
RickWarren_2006 RELIGION DOESN'T HAVE A MONOPOLY ON THAT BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF RELIGIOUS KOOKS THERE ARE SECULAR KOOKS THERE ARE SMART KOOKS DUMB KOOKS THERE ARE PEOPLE A LADY CAME UP TO ME THE OTHER DAY AND SHE HAD A WHITE
RickWarren_2006 SHE GOES WELL I SEE JESUS AND STARTED CRYING AND LEFT
RickWarren_2006 I'M GOING OK YOU
RickWarren_2006 WHEN THE BOOK BECAME THE BEST SELLING BOOK IN THE WORLD FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS
RickWarren_2006 I KIND OF HAD MY LITTLE CRISIS AND THAT WAS WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS
RickWarren_2006 BECAUSE IT BROUGHT IN ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY WHEN YOU WRITE THE BEST SELLING BOOK IN THE WORLD IT'S TONS AND TONS OF MONEY
RickWarren_2006 AND I DECIDED THAT I WAS NEVER GOING TO GO ON TV BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A CELEBRITY I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A QUOTE EVANGELIST TELEVANGELIST THAT'S NOT MY THING AND
RickWarren_2006 ALL OF A SUDDEN IT BROUGHT A LOT OF MONEY AND A LOT OF ATTENTION I DON'T THINK
RickWarren_2006 NOW THIS IS A WORLDVIEW AND I WILL TELL YOU EVERYBODY 'S GOT A WORLDVIEW
RickWarren_2006 AND
RickWarren_2006 WHEN I YOU KNOW MADE A BET I HAPPENED TO BELIEVE THAT JESUS WAS WHO HE SAID HE WAS
RickWarren_2006 BUT EVERYBODY 'S GOT AND I BELIEVE IN A PLURALISTIC SOCIETY EVERYBODY 'S BETTING ON SOMETHING
RickWarren_2006 AND WHEN I STARTED THE CHURCH YOU KNOW I HAD NO PLANS TO DO WHAT IT'S DOING NOW
RickWarren_2006 AND THEN WHEN I WROTE THIS BOOK AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT JUST
RickWarren_2006 TOOK OFF
RickWarren_2006 I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT AND WHEN YOU WRITE A BOOK THAT THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE BOOK IS IT 'S NOT ABOUT YOU THEN WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT BECOMES THE BEST SELLING BOOK IN HISTORY YOU GOT TO FIGURE WELL I GUESS IT'S NOT ABOUT ME
RickWarren_2006 THAT'S KIND OF A NO BRAINER SO WHAT IS IT FOR
RickWarren_2006 AND I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT WHAT I CALL THE STEWARDSHIP OF AFFLUENCE AND THE STEWARDSHIP OF INFLUENCE SO I BELIEVE ESSENTIALLY THAT LEADERSHIP IS STEWARDSHIP
RickWarren_2006 THAT IF YOU ARE A LEADER IN ANY AREA IN BUSINESS IN POLITICS IN SPORTS IN ART IN ACADEMICS IN ANY AREA YOU DON'T
RickWarren_2006 YOU ARE A STEWARD OF IT FOR INSTANCE THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE IN PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT THIS IS NOT MY PLANET IT WASN'T MINE BEFORE I WAS BORN IT'S NOT GOING TO BE MINE AFTER I DIE I'M JUST HERE FOR EIGHTY YEARS AND
RickWarren_2006 THAT'S IT I WAS DEBATING THE OTHER DAY ON A TALK SHOW AND THE GUY WAS CHALLENGING ME AND GO WHAT 'S A PASTOR DOING ON PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT
RickWarren_2006 AND I ASKED THIS GUY I SAID WELL DO YOU BELIEVE THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE RESPONSIBLE
RickWarren_2006 I SAID OH YOU DON 'T I SAID LET ME MAKE THIS CLEAR AGAIN DO YOU BELIEVE THAT AS HUMAN BEINGS I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT RELIGION
RickWarren_2006 DO YOU BELIEVE THAT AS HUMAN BEINGS IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE CARE OF THIS PLANET AND MAKE IT JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER FOR THE NEXT GENERATION AND HE SAID
RickWarren_2006 NOT ANY MORE THAN ANY OTHER SPECIES
RickWarren_2006 WHEN HE SAID THE WORD SPECIES HE WAS REVEALING HIS WORLDVIEW AND HE WAS SAYING I 'M NO MORE RESPONSIBLE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS ENVIRONMENT
RickWarren_2006 AND YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE THAT'S MY WORLDVIEW AND SO YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
RickWarren_2006 WHAT YOUR WORLD IS THE WORLDVIEW IS THE PROBLEM IS MOST PEOPLE NEVER REALLY THINK IT THROUGH THEY NEVER REALLY THEY NEVER REALLY
RickWarren_2006 BUT YOU MAY YOU MAY
RickWarren_2006 YOUR WORLDVIEW THOUGH DOES DETERMINE EVERYTHING ELSE IN YOUR LIFE BECAUSE IT DETERMINES YOUR DECISIONS IT DETERMINES YOUR RELATIONSHIPS IT DETERMINES YOUR LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE
RickWarren_2006 IT DETERMINES REALLY EVERYTHING IN YOUR LIFE WHAT WE BELIEVE OBVIOUSLY AND YOU KNOW THIS DETERMINES OUR BEHAVIOR AND OUR BEHAVIOR DETERMINES WHAT WE BECOME IN LIFE
RickWarren_2006 SO ALL OF THIS MONEY STARTED POURING IN AND ALL OF THIS FAME STARTED POURING IN AND
RickWarren_2006 WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS
RickWarren_2006 MY WIFE AND I FIRST MADE FIVE DECISIONS ON WHAT TO DO WITH THE MONEY WE SAID FIRST
RickWarren_2006 THE SECOND THING WAS
RickWarren_2006 FROM THE CHURCH THAT I PASTOR THIRD THING IS I ADDED UP ALL THAT THE CHURCH HAD PAID ME OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND I GAVE IT BACK
RickWarren_2006 GAVE IT BACK BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY THINKING THAT I DO WHAT I DO FOR MONEY I
RickWarren_2006 PERSONALLY I'VE NEVER MET
RickWarren_2006 A PRIEST OR A PASTOR OR A MINISTER WHO DOES IT FOR MONEY I KNOW THAT'S A STEREOTYPE I'VE NEVER MET ONE OF THEM BELIEVE ME THERE'S A WHOLE LOT EASIER WAYS TO MAKE
RickWarren_2006 BECAUSE MY FATHER IN LAW IS IN HIS LAST PROBABLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS BEFORE HE DIES OF CANCER AND I'M WATCHING A GUY WHO 'S LIVED HIS LIFE HE 'S NOW IN HIS MID
RickWarren_2006 AND HE 'S DYING WITH PEACE YOU KNOW THE TEST OF YOUR WORLDVIEW IS NOT HOW YOU ACT IN THE GOOD TIMES THE TEST OF YOUR WORLDVIEW IS HOW YOU ACT AT THE FUNERAL
RickWarren_2006 AND HAVING BEEN THROUGH LITERALLY
RickWarren_2006 IF NOT THOUSANDS OF FUNERALS IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHAT YOU BELIEVE
RickWarren_2006 OF THE WORLD ILLITERACY POVERTY PANDEMIC DISEASES PARTICULARLY HIV AIDS AND SET UP THESE THREE FOUNDATIONS AND PUT THE MONEY INTO THAT THE LAST THING WE DID IS WE BECAME WHAT I CALL REVERSE
RickWarren_2006 AND THAT IS WHEN MY WIFE AND I GOT MARRIED
RickWarren_2006 THIRTY YEARS AGO
RickWarren_2006 WE STARTED TITHING NOW THAT'S
RickWarren_2006 A PRINCIPLE IN THE BIBLE THAT SAYS GIVE TEN PERCENT OF WHAT YOU GET BACK TO CHARITY GIVE IT AWAY TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE
RickWarren_2006 SO WE STARTED DOING THAT AND EACH YEAR WE WOULD RAISE OUR TITHE ONE PERCENT SO OUR FIRST YEAR OF MARRIAGE WE WENT TO ELEVEN PERCENT SECOND YEAR WE WENT TO TWELVE PERCENT AND THE THIRD YEAR WE WENT TO THIRTEEN PERCENT AND ON AND ON AND ON
RickWarren_2006 WHY DID I DO THAT BECAUSE EVERY TIME I GIVE IT BREAKS THE GRIP OF MATERIALISM IN MY LIFE
RickWarren_2006 IT'S ALL ABOUT MORE HAVING MORE AND WE THINK THAT THE GOOD LIFE IS ACTUALLY LOOKING GOOD
RickWarren_2006 I MEET PEOPLE ALL THE TIME WHO HAVE THOSE AND THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY HAPPY IF MONEY ACTUALLY MADE YOU HAPPY THEN THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WOULD BE THE HAPPIEST AND THAT I KNOW PERSONALLY IS NOT TRUE
RickWarren_2006 SO THE GOOD LIFE IS NOT ABOUT LOOKING GOOD FEELING GOOD OR HAVING THE GOODS IT'S ABOUT BEING GOOD AND DOING GOOD
RickWarren_2006 GIVING YOUR LIFE AWAY SIGNIFICANCE IN LIFE DOESN'T COME FROM STATUS BECAUSE YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND SOMEBODY WHO 'S GOT MORE THAN YOU
RickWarren_2006 IT DOESN'T COME FROM SEX IT DOESN'T COME FROM SALARY IT COMES FROM SERVING IT IS IN GIVING OUR LIVES AWAY THAT WE FIND MEANING WE FIND SIGNIFICANCE
RickWarren_2006 THAT'S THE WAY WE WERE WIRED I BELIEVE BY GOD
RickWarren_2006 AND SO WE BEGAN TO GIVE AWAY AND NOW AFTER THIRTY YEARS MY WIFE AND I ARE REVERSE TITHERS WE GIVE AWAY NINETY PERCENT AND LIVE ON TEN
RickWarren_2006 THAT ACTUALLY WAS THE EASY PART THE HARD PART IS WHAT DO I DO WITH ALL THIS ATTENTION BECAUSE I START GETTING ALL KINDS OF INVITATIONS I JUST CAME OFF OF A NEARLY MONTH LONG SPEAKING TOUR ON THREE
RickWarren_2006 CONTINENTS AND I WON 'T GO INTO THAT BUT IT WAS AN AMAZING THING AND I'M GOING WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS THIS NOTORIETY THAT THE BOOK HAS BROUGHT
RickWarren_2006 AND BEING A PASTOR I STARTED READING THE BIBLE THERE'S A CHAPTER IN THE BIBLE CALLED PSALM SEVENTY TWO AND IT'S SOLOMON 'S PRAYER FOR MORE INFLUENCE WHEN YOU READ THIS PRAYER IT SOUNDS
RickWarren_2006 I WANT YOU TO MAKE ME FAMOUS I WANT YOU TO SPREAD THE FAME OF MY NAME THROUGH EVERY LAND I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME POWER
RickWarren_2006 I WANT YOU TO MAKE ME FAMOUS I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME INFLUENCE AND IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE THE MOST EGOTISTICAL REQUEST YOU COULD MAKE IF YOU WERE
RickWarren_2006 UNTIL YOU READ THE WHOLE PSALM THE WHOLE CHAPTER AND THEN HE SAYS SO THAT THE KING HE WAS THE KING OF ISRAEL AT THAT TIME AT ITS APEX IN POWER
RickWarren_2006 SO THAT THE KING MAY CARE FOR THE WIDOW AND ORPHAN SUPPORT DEPRESSED DEFEND THE DEFENSELESS
RickWarren_2006 CARE FOR THE SICK ASSIST THE POOR SPEAK UP FOR THE FOREIGNER THOSE IN PRISON BASICALLY HE 'S TALKING ABOUT ALL THE MARGINALIZED IN SOCIETY
RickWarren_2006 AND AS I READ THAT I LOOKED AT IT AND I THOUGHT
RickWarren_2006 YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS SAYING IS THAT THE PURPOSE OF INFLUENCE IS TO SPEAK UP FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NO INFLUENCE
RickWarren_2006 OR YOUR NET WORTH AND BY THE WAY YOUR NET WORTH IS NOT THE SAME THING AS
RickWarren_2006 YOUR VALUE IS NOT BASED ON YOUR VALUABLES
RickWarren_2006 BASED ON A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF THINGS AND SO THE PURPOSE OF INFLUENCE IS TO SPEAK UP FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NO INFLUENCE AND I HAD TO ADMIT
RickWarren_2006 I CAN'T THINK OF THE LAST TIME I THOUGHT OF WIDOWS AND ORPHANS THEY'RE NOT ON MY RADAR I PASTOR A CHURCH IN ONE OF THE MOST AFFLUENT AREAS OF AMERICA A BUNCH OF GATED COMMUNITIES I HAVE A CHURCH FULL OF CEOS AND SCIENTISTS
RickWarren_2006 AND I COULD GO FIVE YEARS AND NEVER EVER SEE A HOMELESS PERSON THEY'RE JUST NOT IN MY PATHWAY
RickWarren_2006 NOW THEY'RE THIRTEEN MILES UP THE ROAD IN SANTA ANA
RickWarren_2006 SO I HAD TO SAY OK I WOULD USE WHATEVER AFFLUENCE AND WHATEVER INFLUENCE I'VE GOT TO HELP THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE EITHER OF THOSE
RickWarren_2006 YOU KNOW THERE'S A STORY IN THE BIBLE ABOUT MOSES WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IT'S TRUE OR NOT IT REALLY DIDN'T MATTER TO ME BUT MOSES IF YOU SAW THE MOVIE THE TEN COMMANDMENTS MOSES GOES OUT AND THERE'S THIS BURNING BUSH AND GOD TALKS TO HIM AND GOD SAYS MOSES
RickWarren_2006 WHAT'S IN YOUR HAND
RickWarren_2006 MOSES SAYS IT 'S A STAFF
RickWarren_2006 IT'S A SHEPHERD 'S STAFF AND GOD SAYS THROW IT DOWN AND IF YOU SAW THE MOVIE YOU KNOW HE THROWS IT DOWN AND IT BECOMES A SNAKE
RickWarren_2006 AND THEN GOD SAYS PICK IT UP
RickWarren_2006 AND HE PICKS IT BACK UP AGAIN AND IT BECOMES A STAFF AGAIN
RickWarren_2006 NOW I'M READING THIS THING AND I'M GOING WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT
RickWarren_2006 OK WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT WELL I DO KNOW A COUPLE OF THINGS NUMBER ONE GOD NEVER DOES A MIRACLE TO SHOW OFF
RickWarren_2006 TO SHOW UP HE 'S NOT GOING TO SHOW UP ON CHEESE BREAD
RickWarren_2006 OK I JUST THIS IS WHY I LOVE WHAT MICHAEL DOES BECAUSE IT'S LIKE OK IF HE 'S DEBUNKING IT THEN I DON'T HAVE TO BUT GOD MY GOD DOESN'T SHOW UP ON SPRINKLER IMAGES
RickWarren_2006 A FEW MORE POWERFUL WAYS THAN THAT TO DO WHATEVER HE WANTS TO DO BUT HE DOESN'T DO MIRACLES JUST TO SHOW OFF SECOND THING IS IF GOD EVER ASKS YOU A QUESTION HE ALREADY KNOWS THE ANSWER
RickWarren_2006 NOW FOLLOW ME ON THIS THIS STAFF REPRESENTED THREE THINGS ABOUT MOSES LIFE FIRST IT REPRESENTED HIS IDENTITY HE WAS A SHEPHERD IT'S THE SYMBOL OF HIS OWN OCCUPATION I AM A SHEPHERD
RickWarren_2006 IT'S A SYMBOL OF HIS IDENTITY HIS CAREER HIS JOB SECOND IT'S A SYMBOL OF NOT ONLY HIS IDENTITY IT'S A SYMBOL OF HIS INCOME BECAUSE ALL OF HIS ASSETS ARE TIED UP IN SHEEP
RickWarren_2006 IN THOSE DAYS NOBODY HAD BANK ACCOUNTS OR AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS OR HEDGE FUNDS YOUR ASSETS ARE TIED UP IN YOUR FLOCKS SO IT'S A SYMBOL OF HIS IDENTITY AND IT'S A SYMBOL OF HIS INCOME AND THE THIRD THING IT'S A SYMBOL OF HIS INFLUENCE
RickWarren_2006 A SHEPHERD 'S STAFF WELL
RickWarren_2006 SO HE 'S SAYING YOU
RickWarren_2006 YOUR IDENTITY WHAT'S IN YOUR HAND YOU'VE GOT IDENTITY YOU'VE GOT INCOME YOU'VE GOT INFLUENCE WHAT'S IN YOUR HAND
RickWarren_2006 DOWN I'LL MAKE IT COME ALIVE I'LL DO SOME THINGS YOU COULD NEVER IMAGINE POSSIBLE AND IF YOU'VE WATCHED THAT MOVIE TEN COMMANDMENTS ALL OF THOSE BIG MIRACLES THAT HAPPEN IN EGYPT ARE DONE THROUGH THIS STAFF
RickWarren_2006 LAST YEAR I WAS INVITED TO SPEAK AT NBA ALL STARS GAME
RickWarren_2006 AND SO I'M TALKING TO THE PLAYERS BECAUSE MOST OF THE NBA TEAMS NFL TEAMS AND ALL THE OTHER TEAMS HAVE DONE THIS FORTY DAYS OF PURPOSE BASED ON THE BOOK
RickWarren_2006 AND
RickWarren_2006 I ASKED THEM I SAID WHAT 'S IN YOUR HAND SO WHAT'S IN YOUR HAND I SAID IT 'S A BASKETBALL
RickWarren_2006 AND THAT BASKETBALL REPRESENTS YOUR IDENTITY WHO YOU ARE YOU'RE AN NBA PLAYER IT REPRESENTS YOUR INCOME YOU'RE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY OFF THAT LITTLE BALL AND IT REPRESENTS YOUR INFLUENCE
RickWarren_2006 AND EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO BE IN THE NBA FOR A FEW YEARS YOU'RE GOING TO BE AN NBA PLAYER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND THAT GIVES WITH YOU ENORMOUS INFLUENCE SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH WHAT YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN
RickWarren_2006 AND I GUESS
RickWarren_2006 THAT'S THE MAIN REASON I CAME UP HERE TODAY TO ALL OF YOU VERY BRIGHT PEOPLE AT TED
RickWarren_2006 BACKGROUND EDUCATION FREEDOM
RickWarren_2006 IDEAS CREATIVITY WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH WHAT YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN THAT TO ME IS THE PRIMARY QUESTION ABOUT LIFE THAT
RickWarren_2006 TO ME IS WHAT BEING PURPOSE DRIVEN IS ALL ABOUT
RickWarren_2006 IN THE BOOK I TALK ABOUT HOW YOU'RE WIRED TO DO CERTAIN THINGS YOU'RE SHAPED THIS LITTLE CROSS TAKES SPIRITUAL GIFTS HEART ABILITY PERSONALITY AND EXPERIENCES
RickWarren_2006 WHY WOULD GOD WIRE YOU TO DO SOMETHING AND THEN NOT HAVE YOU DO IT IF YOU'RE WIRED TO BE AN ANTHROPOLOGIST YOU'LL BE AN ANTHROPOLOGIST IF YOU'RE WIRED TO BE AN UNDERSEAS EXPLORER YOU'LL BE AN UNDERSEA EXPLORER IF YOU'RE WIRED TO MAKE DEALS YOU MAKE DEALS IF YOU'RE WIRED TO
RickWarren_2006 DID YOU KNOW THAT GOD SMILES WHEN YOU BE YOU
RickWarren_2006 WHEN MY LITTLE KIDS WERE LITTLE THEY'RE ALL GROWN NOW I HAVE GRANDKIDS I USED TO GO IN AND SIT ON THE SIDE OF THEIR BED AND I USED TO WATCH MY KIDS SLEEP
RickWarren_2006 AND I JUST WATCHED THEIR LITTLE BODIES RISE AND LOWER
RickWarren_2006 RISE AND LOWER AND I WOULD LOOK AT THEM THIS IS NOT AN ACCIDENT RISE AND LOWER
RickWarren_2006 AND I GOT JOY OUT OF JUST WATCHING THEM SLEEP
RickWarren_2006 SOME PEOPLE HAVE THE MISGUIDED IDEA THAT GOD ONLY GETS EXCITED WHEN YOU'RE DOING QUOTE SPIRITUAL THINGS LIKE GOING TO CHURCH OR
RickWarren_2006 HELPING THE POOR OR
RickWarren_2006 YOU KNOW CONFESSING OR DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT
RickWarren_2006 THE BOTTOM LINE IS GOD GETS PLEASURE WATCHING YOU BE YOU WHY HE MADE YOU AND WHEN YOU DO WHAT YOU WERE MADE TO DO HE GOES THAT 'S MY BOY
RickWarren_2006 THAT'S MY GIRL YOU'RE USING THE TALENT AND ABILITY THAT I GAVE
RickWarren_2006 INCOME AND SAY IT 'S NOT ABOUT ME IT'S ABOUT
