MalteSpitz_2012G THIS IS MY
MalteSpitz_2012G MOBILE PHONE
MalteSpitz_2012G PROTEST IN EGYPT
MalteSpitz_2012G AND WITH A MOBILE PHONE YOU CAN RECORD A SONG LOAD IT UP TO SOUNDCLOUD AND BECOME FAMOUS ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE WITH YOUR MOBILE PHONE I 'M A CHILD OF ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR AND I LIVE IN THE CITY OF BERLIN
MalteSpitz_2012G LET 'S GO BACK TO THAT TIME TO THIS CITY HERE YOU CAN SEE HOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STOOD UP AND PROTESTED FOR CHANGE THIS IS AUTUMN ONE THOUSAND NINE
MalteSpitz_2012G HOLD IT UP AN ANDROID A BLACKBERRY WOW THAT 'S A LOT ALMOST EVERYBODY TODAY HAS A MOBILE PHONE
MalteSpitz_2012G BUT
MalteSpitz_2012G TODAY I WILL TALK ABOUT ME AND MY MOBILE PHONE AND HOW IT CHANGED
MalteSpitz_2012G MY LIFE AND
MalteSpitz_2012G I WILL TALK ABOUT THIS THESE ARE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY LINES OF INFORMATION RAW DATA
MalteSpitz_2012G AND WHY ARE THESE INFORMATIONS THERE
MalteSpitz_2012G BECAUSE IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THE E U COMMISSION TABLED A DIRECTIVE THIS DIRECTIVE IS CALLED DATA RETENTION DIRECTIVE THIS DIRECTIVE SAYS THAT EACH PHONE COMPANY IN EUROPE
MalteSpitz_2012G EACH INTERNET SERVICE COMPANY ALL OVER EUROPE HAS TO STORE A WIDE RANGE OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE USERS
MalteSpitz_2012G ALL THIS INFORMATION IS STORED FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS UP TO TWO YEARS BY YOUR PHONE COMPANY
MalteSpitz_2012G THEY SAID WE DON 'T WANT THIS DATA RETENTION WE WANT SELF DETERMINATION IN THE DIGITAL AGE AND WE DON 'T WANT THAT PHONE COMPANIES AND INTERNET COMPANIES HAVE TO STORE ALL THIS INFORMATION ABOUT
MalteSpitz_2012G AND SOME EVEN SAID THIS WOULD BE STASI TWO POINT
MalteSpitz_2012G AND
MalteSpitz_2012G BUT THEN I SAID I WANT TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION BECAUSE THIS IS MY LIFE YOU ARE PROTOCOLING SO I DECIDED TO START A LAWSUIT AGAINST THEM BECAUSE I WANTED TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION BUT DEUTSCHE TELEKOM SAID NO WE WILL NOT GIVE YOU THIS INFORMATION
MalteSpitz_2012G SO AT THE END I HAD A SETTLEMENT WITH THEM I 'LL PUT DOWN THE LAWSUIT AND THEY WILL SEND ME ALL THE INFORMATION I ASK FOR BECAUSE IN THE MEAN TIME THE GERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULED THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS E U DIRECTIVE INTO GERMAN LAW WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
MalteSpitz_2012G SO I GOT THIS UGLY BROWN ENVELOPE WITH A C D INSIDE AND ON THE C D THIS WAS ON
MalteSpitz_2012G THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY LINES OF INFORMATION
MalteSpitz_2012G SO I WAS A LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH IT BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE WHERE I AM WHERE I SLEEP AT NIGHT
MalteSpitz_2012G AND YOU CAN EVEN SEE HOW I GO FROM FRANKFURT BY TRAIN TO COLOGNE AND HOW OFTEN I CALL IN BETWEEN ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE WITH THIS INFORMATION
MalteSpitz_2012G IT IS NOT ONLY ABOUT ME
MalteSpitz_2012G IT 'S ABOUT ALL OF US FIRST IT 'S ONLY LIKE
MalteSpitz_2012G AND THEN THERE ARE SOME FRIENDS CALLING ME AND THEY CALL EACH OTHER AND AFTER A WHILE YOU ARE CALLING YOU AND YOU ARE CALLING YOU AND YOU HAVE THIS GREAT COMMUNICATION NETWORK
MalteSpitz_2012G YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THIS YOU CAN SEE THE HUBS LIKE WHO ARE THE LEADERS IN THE GROUP IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION YOU CAN SEE WHAT YOUR SOCIETY IS DOING IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR SOCIETY
MalteSpitz_2012G THIS IS A BLUEPRINT FOR COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND IRAN
MalteSpitz_2012G LIKE I SAID AT THE BEGINNING
MalteSpitz_2012G TODAY STATE AGENCIES AND COMPANIES WANT TO STORE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS THEY CAN
MalteSpitz_2012G GET ABOUT US ONLINE AND OFFLINE THEY WANT TO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO TRACK OUR LIVES AND THEY WANT TO STORE THEM FOR ALL TIME
MalteSpitz_2012G BUT SELF DETERMINATION AND LIVING IN THE DIGITAL AGE IS NO CONTRADICTION BUT YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR YOUR SELF DETERMINATION TODAY YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT EVERY DAY
MalteSpitz_2012G SO WHEN YOU GO HOME TELL YOUR FRIENDS THAT PRIVACY IS A VALUE OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND IT 'S NOT OUTDATED WHEN YOU GO HOME TELL YOUR REPRESENTATIVE ONLY BECAUSE
MalteSpitz_2012G COMPANIES AND STATE AGENCIES HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO STORE CERTAIN INFORMATION THEY DON 'T HAVE TO DO IT
MalteSpitz_2012G AND IF YOU
MalteSpitz_2012G SO IN THE FUTURE
MalteSpitz_2012G EVERY TIME YOU USE YOUR MOBILE PHONE LET IT BE A REMINDER TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR SELF DETERMINATION IN THE DIGITAL AGE THANK YOU
