RobertGupta_2010U@16.8:23.48 ONE DAY LOS ANGELES TIMES COLUMNIST STEVE LOPEZ WAS WALKING ALONG THE STREETS OF DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES WHEN HE HEARD
RobertGupta_2010U@23.48:27.46 BEAUTIFUL MUSIC AND THE SOURCE WAS A MAN
RobertGupta_2010U@27.46:36.45 AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN CHARMING RUGGED HOMELESS PLAYING A VIOLIN THAT ONLY HAD TWO STRINGS
RobertGupta_2010U@36.45:43.67 AND I 'M TELLING A STORY THAT MANY OF YOU KNOW BECAUSE STEVE 'S COLUMNS BECAME THE BASIS FOR A BOOK WHICH WAS TURNED INTO A MOVIE
RobertGupta_2010U@43.67:54.02 WITH ROBERT DOWNEY JR ACTING AS STEVE LOPEZ AND JAMIE FOXX AS NATHANIEL ANTHONY AYERS THE JUILLIARD TRAINED DOUBLE BASSIST WHOSE PROMISING CAREER WAS CUT SHORT
RobertGupta_2010U@54.02:57.44 BY A TRAGIC AFFLICTION WITH PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA
RobertGupta_2010U@57.44:72.105 NATHANIEL DROPPED OUT OF JUILLIARD HE SUFFERED A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN AND THIRTY YEARS LATER HE WAS LIVING HOMELESS ON THE STREETS OF SKID ROW IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES I ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO READ STEVE 'S BOOK OR TO WATCH THE MOVIE TO UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY THE BEAUTIFUL BOND
RobertGupta_2010U@72.105:83.485 THAT FORMED BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN BUT HOW MUSIC HELPED SHAPE THAT BOND AND ULTIMATELY WAS INSTRUMENTAL IF YOU 'LL PARDON THE PUN IN HELPING NATHANIEL GET OFF THE STREETS
RobertGupta_2010U@83.485:107.505 I MET MISTER AYERS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO YEARS AGO AT WALT DISNEY CONCERT HALL HE HAD JUST HEARD A PERFORMANCE OF BEETHOVEN 'S FIRST AND FOURTH SYMPHONIES AND CAME BACKSTAGE AND INTRODUCED HIMSELF HE WAS SPEAKING IN A VERY JOVIAL AND GREGARIOUS WAY ABOUT YO YO MA AND HILLARY CLINTON AND HOW THE DODGERS WERE NEVER GOING TO MAKE THE WORLD SERIES ALL BECAUSE OF THE TREACHEROUS FIRST VIOLIN PASSAGE WORK IN THE LAST MOVEMENT IN BEETHOVEN 'S FOURTH SYMPHONY
RobertGupta_2010U@107.505:119.22 AND WE GOT TALKING ABOUT MUSIC AND I GOT AN EMAIL FROM STEVE A FEW DAYS LATER SAYING THAT NATHANIEL WAS INTERESTED IN A VIOLIN LESSON WITH ME NOW I SHOULD MENTION THAT NATHANIEL REFUSES TREATMENT
RobertGupta_2010U@119.22:127.96 BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS TREATED IT WAS WITH SHOCK THERAPY AND THORAZINE AND HANDCUFFS AND THAT SCAR HAS STAYED WITH HIM FOR HIS ENTIRE LIFE
RobertGupta_2010U@127.96:136.3 BUT AS A RESULT NOW HE IS PRONE TO THESE SCHIZOPHRENIC EPISODES THE WORST OF WHICH CAN MANIFEST THEMSELVES AS HIM EXPLODING
RobertGupta_2010U@136.3:146.16 AND THEN DISAPPEARING FOR DAYS WANDERING THE STREETS OF SKID ROW EXPOSED TO ITS HORRORS WITH THE TORMENT OF HIS OWN MIND UNLEASHED UPON HIM
RobertGupta_2010U@146.16:157.3 AND NATHANIEL WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF AGITATION WHEN WE STARTED OUR FIRST LESSON AT WALT DISNEY CONCERT HALL HE HAD A KIND OF MANIC GLINT IN HIS EYES HE WAS LOST
RobertGupta_2010U@157.3:174.63 AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT INVISIBLE DEMONS AND SMOKE AND HOW SOMEONE WAS POISONING HIM IN HIS SLEEP AND I WAS AFRAID NOT FOR MYSELF BUT I WAS AFRAID THAT I WAS GOING TO LOSE HIM THAT HE WAS GOING TO SINK INTO ONE OF HIS STATES
RobertGupta_2010U@174.63:183.19 AND THAT I WOULD RUIN HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VIOLIN IF I STARTED TALKING ABOUT SCALES AND ARPEGGIOS AND OTHER EXCITING FORMS OF DIDACTIC VIOLIN PEDAGOGY
RobertGupta_2010U@183.19:184.195 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
RobertGupta_2010U@184.195:187.045 SO I JUST STARTED PLAYING
RobertGupta_2010U@187.045:198.67 AND I PLAYED THE FIRST MOVEMENT OF THE BEETHOVEN VIOLIN CONCERTO AND AS I PLAYED I UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS A PROFOUND CHANGE OCCURRING IN NATHANIEL 'S EYES
RobertGupta_2010U@198.67:205.41 IT WAS AS IF HE WAS IN THE GRIP OF SOME INVISIBLE PHARMACEUTICAL A CHEMICAL REACTION FOR WHICH MY PLAYING THE MUSIC
RobertGupta_2010U@205.41:212.29 WAS ITS CATALYST AND NATHANIEL 'S MANIC RAGE
RobertGupta_2010U@212.29:220.01 WAS TRANSFORMED INTO UNDERSTANDING A QUIET CURIOSITY AND GRACE
RobertGupta_2010U@220.01:233.015 AND IN A MIRACLE HE LIFTED HIS OWN VIOLIN AND HE STARTED PLAYING BY EAR CERTAIN SNIPPETS OF VIOLIN CONCERTOS WHICH HE THEN ASKED ME TO COMPLETE MENDELSSOHN TCHAIKOVSKY SIBELIUS
RobertGupta_2010U@233.015:245.53 AND WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT MUSIC FROM BACH TO BEETHOVEN AND BRAHMS BRUCKNER ALL THE B 'S FROM BARTOK ALL THE WAY UP TO ESA PEKKA SALONEN AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT HE NOT ONLY HAD AN ENCYCLOPEDIC KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC
RobertGupta_2010U@245.53:255.505 BUT HE RELATED TO THIS MUSIC AT A PERSONAL LEVEL HE SPOKE ABOUT IT WITH THE KIND OF PASSION AND UNDERSTANDING THAT I SHARE WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC
RobertGupta_2010U@255.505:261.43 AND THROUGH PLAYING MUSIC AND TALKING ABOUT MUSIC THIS MAN HAD TRANSFORMED
RobertGupta_2010U@261.43:269.46 FROM THE PARANOID DISTURBED MAN THAT HAD JUST COME FROM WALKING THE STREETS OF DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES TO THE CHARMING
RobertGupta_2010U@269.46:278.36 ERUDITE BRILLIANT JUILLIARD TRAINED MUSICIAN MUSIC IS MEDICINE
RobertGupta_2010U@278.36:291.8 MUSIC CHANGES US AND FOR NATHANIEL MUSIC IS SANITY BECAUSE MUSIC ALLOWS HIM TO TAKE HIS THOUGHTS AND DELUSIONS AND SHAPE THEM THROUGH HIS IMAGINATION AND HIS CREATIVITY INTO REALITY
RobertGupta_2010U@291.8:296.11 AND THAT IS AN ESCAPE FROM HIS TORMENTED STATE
RobertGupta_2010U@296.11:307.125 AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WAS THE VERY ESSENCE OF ART THIS WAS THE VERY REASON WHY WE MADE MUSIC THAT WE TAKE SOMETHING THAT EXISTS WITHIN ALL OF US AT OUR VERY FUNDAMENTAL CORE OUR EMOTIONS
RobertGupta_2010U@307.125:313.79 AND THROUGH OUR ARTISTIC LENS THROUGH OUR CREATIVITY WE 'RE ABLE TO SHAPE THOSE EMOTIONS INTO REALITY
RobertGupta_2010U@313.79:322.94 AND THE REALITY OF THAT EXPRESSION REACHES ALL OF US AND MOVES US INSPIRES AND UNITES US
RobertGupta_2010U@322.94:328.08 AND FOR NATHANIEL MUSIC BROUGHT HIM BACK INTO A FOLD OF FRIENDS
RobertGupta_2010U@328.08:338.63 THE REDEMPTIVE POWER OF MUSIC BROUGHT HIM BACK INTO A FAMILY OF MUSICIANS THAT UNDERSTOOD HIM THAT RECOGNIZED HIS TALENTS AND RESPECTED HIM
RobertGupta_2010U@338.63:351.17 AND I WILL ALWAYS MAKE MUSIC WITH NATHANIEL WHETHER WE 'RE AT WALT DISNEY CONCERT HALL OR ON SKID ROW BECAUSE HE REMINDS ME WHY I BECAME A MUSICIAN THANK YOU
