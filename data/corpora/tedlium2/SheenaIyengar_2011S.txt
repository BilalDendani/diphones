SheenaIyengar_2011S HOW MANY CHOICES YOU MAKE IN A TYPICAL DAY
SheenaIyengar_2011S I RECENTLY DID A SURVEY WITH OVER TWO THOUSAND AMERICANS
SheenaIyengar_2011S AND THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF CHOICES THAT THE TYPICAL AMERICAN REPORTS MAKING IS ABOUT SEVENTY IN A TYPICAL DAY
SheenaIyengar_2011S ONLY ABOUT TWELVE PERCENT OF THE DECISIONS DID THEY MAKE AN HOUR OR MORE OF THEIR TIME
SheenaIyengar_2011S THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN CHOICES
SheenaIyengar_2011S DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY CHOICES MAKE IT INTO YOUR NINE MINUTE CATEGORY VERSUS YOUR ONE HOUR CATEGORY
SheenaIyengar_2011S TODAY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST MODERN DAY CHOOSING PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE
SheenaIyengar_2011S WHICH IS THE CHOICE OVERLOAD PROBLEM
SheenaIyengar_2011S I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND SOME POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS
SheenaIyengar_2011S NOW AS I TALK ABOUT THIS PROBLEM I 'M GOING TO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND I 'M GOING TO WANT TO KNOW YOUR ANSWERS
SheenaIyengar_2011S I USED TO LOVE GOING TO THIS STORE
SheenaIyengar_2011S AND HE POINTED TO THE BUSLOADS OF TOURISTS THAT WOULD SHOW UP EVERYDAY WITH CAMERAS READY USUALLY
SheenaIyengar_2011S WE DECIDED TO DO A LITTLE
SheenaIyengar_2011S WE THERE PUT OUT SIX DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF JAM OR TWENTY FOUR DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF JAM AND WE LOOKED AT TWO THINGS
SheenaIyengar_2011S MORE PEOPLE STOPPED WHEN THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT
SheenaIyengar_2011S NOW WE SEE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT
SheenaIyengar_2011S OF THE PEOPLE WHO STOPPED WHEN THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR ONLY THREE PERCENT OF THEM ACTUALLY BOUGHT A JAR OF JAM OF THE PEOPLE WHO STOPPED WHEN THERE WERE SIX
SheenaIyengar_2011S WELL NOW WE SAW THAT THIRTY PERCENT OF THEM ACTUALLY BOUGHT A JAR OF JAM
SheenaIyengar_2011S NOW IF YOU DO THE MATH PEOPLE WERE AT LEAST SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BUY A JAR OF JAM IF THEY ENCOUNTERED SIX
SheenaIyengar_2011S BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS CHOICE OVERLOAD PROBLEM AFFECTS US EVEN IN VERY CONSEQUENTIAL DECISIONS WE CHOOSE NOT TO CHOOSE EVEN WHEN IT GOES AGAINST OUR BEST SELF INTERESTS
SheenaIyengar_2011S ALL IN THE U S
SheenaIyengar_2011S WHEN THERE ARE MORE CHOICES PRESENT
SheenaIyengar_2011S EVEN THEN IT HAS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES
SheenaIyengar_2011S SO FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO DID CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE THE MORE CHOICES AVAILABLE THE MORE LIKELY PEOPLE WERE TO COMPLETELY AVOID STOCKS OR EQUITY FUNDS
SheenaIyengar_2011S THE MORE CHOICES AVAILABLE THE MORE LIKELY THEY WERE TO PUT ALL THEIR MONEY IN PURE MONEY MARKET
SheenaIyengar_2011S SIMPLE TECHNIQUES
SheenaIyengar_2011S TECHNIQUES THAT WE HAVE TESTED IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IN DIFFERENT RESEARCH VENUES THAT YOU CAN EASILY APPLY IN YOUR BUSINESSES
SheenaIyengar_2011S THERE 'S A LOWERING OF COSTS THERE IS AN IMPROVEMENT OF THE CHOOSING EXPERIENCE
SheenaIyengar_2011S A FUNCTION OF BOTH INCREASE IN SALES AND LOWERING OF COSTS
SheenaIyengar_2011S LARGEST RETAILER
SheenaIyengar_2011S NOW IN THE FINANCIAL SAVINGS WORLD I THINK ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES THAT HAS RECENTLY
SheenaIyengar_2011S THOSE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WANT TO CHOOSE
SheenaIyengar_2011S THEY 'RE GIVEN TWENTY FUNDS NOT THREE HUNDRED OR MORE FUNDS
SheenaIyengar_2011S YOU KNOW OFTEN PEOPLE SAY I DON 'T KNOW HOW TO CUT
SheenaIyengar_2011S AND THE FIRST THING I DO IS I ASK THE EMPLOYEES TELL ME HOW THESE CHOICES ARE DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER AND IF YOUR EMPLOYEES CAN 'T TELL THEM APART NEITHER CAN YOUR CONSUMERS
SheenaIyengar_2011S TO OFFER PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE AN ALL EXPENSES PAID FREE VACATION TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ROAD IN THE WORLD
SheenaIyengar_2011S THAT IT WAS MORE REAL THE SECOND TIME AROUND
SheenaIyengar_2011S BECAUSE THE PICTURES MADE IT FEEL MORE REAL TO YOU
SheenaIyengar_2011S WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE SECOND TECHNIQUE FOR HANDLING THE CHOICE OVERLOAD PROBLEM WHICH IS CONCRETIZATION
SheenaIyengar_2011S AND THAT THE CONSEQUENCES NEED TO BE FELT IN A VIVID SORT OF WAY IN A VERY CONCRETE
SheenaIyengar_2011S A CREDIT CARD AS OPPOSED TO CASH BECAUSE IT DOESN 'T FEEL LIKE REAL MONEY
SheenaIyengar_2011S THE ONE LITTLE THING WE ADDED
SheenaIyengar_2011S BY DOING THAT SIMPLE THING
SheenaIyengar_2011S SO FOR EXAMPLE
SheenaIyengar_2011S HERE 'S A STUDY WE DID IN A MAGAZINE AISLE
SheenaIyengar_2011S THE MAGAZINE AISLES RANGE ANYWHERE FROM THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY
SheenaIyengar_2011S ONE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MAGAZINES ALL THE WAY UP TO SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY
SheenaIyengar_2011S VERSUS I SHOW YOU FOUR HUNDRED MAGAZINES AND DIVIDE THEM UP INTO TWENTY CATEGORIES
SheenaIyengar_2011S YOU BELIEVE THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU MORE CHOICE AND A BETTER CHOOSING EXPERIENCE IF I GAVE YOU THE FOUR HUNDRED THAN IF I GAVE YOU THE SIX HUNDRED
SheenaIyengar_2011S BECAUSE THE CATEGORIES TELL ME HOW TO TELL THEM APART
SheenaIyengar_2011S CAR COLORS EXTERIOR CAR COLORS I 'VE GOT FIFTY SIX CHOICES
SheenaIyengar_2011S THEY GO FROM LOW CHOICE TO HIGH CHOICE THEY 'RE HANGING IN THERE IT 'S THE SAME INFORMATION
SheenaIyengar_2011S IT 'S THE SAME NUMBER OF CHOICES THE ONLY THING THAT I HAVE DONE IS I HAVE VARIED THE ORDER IN WHICH THAT INFORMATION IS PRESENTED IF I START YOU OFF EASY I LEARN HOW TO CHOOSE
SheenaIyengar_2011S SO LET ME RECAP
SheenaIyengar_2011S CUT GET RID OF THE EXTRANEOUS ALTERNATIVES CONCRETIZE MAKE IT REAL
SheenaIyengar_2011S ALL OF THESE TECHNIQUES THAT I 'M DESCRIBING TO YOU TODAY ARE DESIGNED TO HELP YOU MANAGE YOUR CHOICES BETTER FOR YOU YOU CAN USE THEM ON YOURSELF BETTER FOR THE PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE SERVING BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE KEY TO GETTING THE MOST FROM CHOICE IS TO BE CHOOSY ABOUT CHOOSING
