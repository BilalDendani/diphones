DavidDow_2012X@17.64:26.83 I WAS SITTING AT THE KITCHEN TABLE WITH MY WIFE KATYA AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT I WAS GONNA TALK ABOUT TODAY
DavidDow_2012X@27.65:32.61 WE HAVE AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD SON HIS NAME IS LINCOLN HE WAS SITTING AT THE SAME TABLE
DavidDow_2012X@32.87:34.6 DOING HIS MATH HOMEWORK
DavidDow_2012X@34.8:36.74 AND DURING A PAUSE
DavidDow_2012X@36.96:44.11 IN MY CONVERSATION WITH KATYA I LOOKED OVER AT LINCOLN AND I WAS SUDDENLY THUNDERSTRUCK
DavidDow_2012X@44.8:47.76 BY A RECOLLECTION OF A CLIENT OF MINE
DavidDow_2012X@48.38:50.84 MY CLIENT WAS A GUY NAMED WILL
DavidDow_2012X@54.02:57.43 HE WAS FROM NORTH TEXAS HE NEVER KNEW HIS FATHER VERY WELL BECAUSE HIS FATHER
DavidDow_2012X@107.05:110.25 AND I REALIZED THAT WHEN MY CLIENT WILL
DavidDow_2012X@110.51:112.15 WAS HIS AGE
DavidDow_2012X@112.61:114.98 HE 'D BEEN LIVING BY HIMSELF FOR TWO YEARS
DavidDow_2012X@116.36:123.31 WILL EVENTUALLY JOINED A GANG AND COMMITTED A NUMBER OF VERY SERIOUS CRIMES
DavidDow_2012X@123.48:126.17 INCLUDING MOST SERIOUSLY OF ALL
DavidDow_2012X@126.88:128.74 A HORRIBLE TRAGIC MURDER
DavidDow_2012X@130.57:135.92 AND WILL WAS ULTIMATELY EXECUTED AS PUNISHMENT FOR THAT CRIME
DavidDow_2012X@136.91:139.57 BUT I DON 'T WANT TO
DavidDow_2012X@140.02:149.76 TALK TODAY ABOUT THE MORALITY OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT I CERTAINLY THINK THAT MY CLIENT SHOULDN 'T HAVE BEEN EXECUTED BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO TODAY INSTEAD
DavidDow_2012X@155.44:159.63 IN A WAY THAT IS ENTIRELY NONCONTROVERSIAL
DavidDow_2012X@160.73:162.36 I THINK THAT 'S POSSIBLE
DavidDow_2012X@162.39:166.56 BECAUSE THERE IS A CORNER OF THE DEATH PENALTY DEBATE
DavidDow_2012X@166.61:168.28 MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT CORNER
DavidDow_2012X@168.94:171.2 WHERE EVERYBODY AGREES
DavidDow_2012X@171.69:179.5 WHERE THE MOST ARDENT DEATH PENALTY SUPPORTERS AND THE MOST VOCIFEROUS ABOLITIONISTS
DavidDow_2012X@179.69:181.9 ARE ON EXACTLY THE SAME PAGE
DavidDow_2012X@182.63:184.89 THAT 'S THE CORNER I WANT TO EXPLORE
DavidDow_2012X@185.14:204.31 BEFORE I DO THAT THOUGH I WANT TO SPEND A COUPLE OF MINUTES TELLING YOU HOW A DEATH PENALTY CASE UNFOLDS AND THEN I WANT TO TELL YOU TWO LESSONS THAT I HAVE LEARNED OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AS A DEATH PENALTY LAWYER FROM WATCHING WELL MORE THAN A HUNDRED CASES UNFOLD IN THIS WAY
DavidDow_2012X@220.02:228.7 AND IT 'S FOLLOWED BY A TRIAL WHERE THE MURDERER IS CONVICTED AND SENT TO DEATH ROW AND THAT DEATH SENTENCE IS ULTIMATELY UPHELD BY THE STATE APPELLATE COURT
DavidDow_2012X@235.99:243.33 THE THIRD CHAPTER IS AN EVEN MORE COMPLICATED LEGAL PROCEEDING KNOWN AS A FEDERAL HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDING AND THE FOURTH CHAPTER
DavidDow_2012X@276.95:293.7 SO WHAT ALL OF THESE DEATH ROW INMATES HAD TO DO WAS RELY ON VOLUNTEER LAWYERS TO HANDLE THEIR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAN THERE WERE LAWYERS WHO HAD BOTH THE INTEREST AND THE EXPERTISE TO WORK ON THESE CASES
DavidDow_2012X@293.88:295.45 AND SO INEVITABLY
DavidDow_2012X@305.39:315.3 SOME OF THESE LAWYERS WERE SUCCESSFUL THEY MANAGED TO GET NEW TRIALS FOR THEIR CLIENTS YEARS SOMETIMES BY MONTHS
DavidDow_2012X@315.35:324.63 BUT THE ONE THING THAT DIDN 'T HAPPEN ANNUAL EXECUTIONS IN TEXAS
DavidDow_2012X@365.06:376.64 SO WE HAVE THIS PARADOX WHY IS THAT
DavidDow_2012X@491.5:495.4 HERE 'S THE SECOND THING I LEARNED MY CLIENT WILL
DavidDow_2012X@495.61:500.53 WAS NOT THE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE HE WAS THE RULE
DavidDow_2012X@508.21:510.46 I 'LL WRITE HIS BIOGRAPHY FOR YOU
DavidDow_2012X@511.22:517.59 AND EIGHT OUT OF TEN TIMES THE DETAILS OF THAT BIOGRAPHY WILL BE MORE OR LESS ACCURATE
DavidDow_2012X@517.91:531.9 AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW ARE EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW ARE PEOPLE WHO HAD EXPOSURE TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM
DavidDow_2012X@532.56:534.46 THAT 'S THE SECOND LESSON
DavidDow_2012X@537.76:540.05 RIGHT ON THE CUSP OF THAT CORNER
DavidDow_2012X@540.43:542.27 WHERE EVERYBODY 'S GOING TO AGREE
DavidDow_2012X@547.82:549.89 BUT I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE
DavidDow_2012X@553.52:558.34 WOULD BE A STORY WHERE NO MURDER EVER OCCURS
DavidDow_2012X@582.88:586.91 BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AS DWIGHT EISENHOWER SAID
DavidDow_2012X@587.25:590.76 THE WAY YOU SOLVE A PROBLEM IS TO MAKE IT BIGGER
DavidDow_2012X@592.64:594.91 THE WAY WE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM
DavidDow_2012X@598.93:601.01 WE HAVE TO SAY ALL RIGHT
DavidDow_2012X@601.3:610.18 WE HAVE THESE FOUR CHAPTERS OF A DEATH PENALTY STORY BUT WHAT HAPPENS BEFORE THAT STORY BEGINS
DavidDow_2012X@610.7:614.17 HOW CAN WE INTERVENE IN THE LIFE OF A MURDERER
DavidDow_2012X@614.55:621.53 BEFORE HE 'S A MURDERER WHAT OPTIONS DO WE HAVE TO NUDGE THAT PERSON
DavidDow_2012X@621.62:632.18 OFF OF THE PATH STILL THINK IS A BAD RESULT
DavidDow_2012X@632.47:634.59 THE MURDER OF AN INNOCENT HUMAN BEING
DavidDow_2012X@649.77:656.38 WELL THAT 'S ROCKET SCIENCE THAT 'S THE MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION FOR THE THRUST CREATED BY A ROCKET
DavidDow_2012X@656.92:658.98 WHAT WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY
DavidDow_2012X@659.3:661 IS JUST AS COMPLICATED
DavidDow_2012X@661.61:664.68 WHAT WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS ALSO
DavidDow_2012X@664.84:668.35 ROCKET SCIENCE MY CLIENT WILL
DavidDow_2012X@703.62:718.39 IN HIS EARLY CHILDHOOD YEARS WHEN HE WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THERE WERE A WIDE VARIETY OF THINGS THAT SOCIETY COULD HAVE DONE IN FACT IF WE JUST IMAGINE
DavidDow_2012X@746.65:749.97 THAT DOESN 'T MEAN THAT WE DON 'T KNOW A LOT ALREADY
DavidDow_2012X@765.47:766.98 I 'LL JUST MENTION A FEW
DavidDow_2012X@793.96:796.97 WE COULD BE PROVIDING EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE
DavidDow_2012X@809.06:810.91 THERE ARE OTHER STATES THAT DO THAT
DavidDow_2012X@832.08:840.48 THERE 'S ONE OTHER THING WE CAN BE DOING WELL THERE ARE A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE COULD BE DOING THERE 'S ONE OTHER THING THAT WE COULD BE THAT I SAY TODAY
DavidDow_2012X@841.37:845.03 WE COULD BE INTERVENING MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVELY
DavidDow_2012X@854.97:857.17 IF WE 'RE GONNA DO THAT
DavidDow_2012X@871.43:873.2 IT 'S NOT YET TOO LATE
DavidDow_2012X@873.74:876.3 THERE 'S STILL TIME TO NUDGE THEM
DavidDow_2012X@876.51:880.75 IF WE THINK ABOUT NUDGING THEM RATHER THAN JUST PUNISHING THEM
DavidDow_2012X@943.71:945.93 IS WE 'RE PAYING LATER
DavidDow_2012X@946.51:948.4 BUT THE THING IS
DavidDow_2012X@962.77:968.61 EVEN IF YOU DON 'T AGREE THAT THERE 'S A MORAL IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO IT
DavidDow_2012X@969.51:972.47 IT JUST MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE
DavidDow_2012X@979.74:981.65 THE DAY THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE EXECUTED
DavidDow_2012X@988.36:990.31 AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HIS LIFE
DavidDow_2012X@995.49:997.19 AND THEN ABOUT HIS MOM
DavidDow_2012X@997.73:1000.08 WHO HE DID KNOW WHO IS STILL ALIVE
DavidDow_2012X@1007.62:1009.4 I KNOW THAT SHE TRIED TO KILL YOU
DavidDow_2012X@1012.96:1014.61 ACTUALLY REMEMBER THAT
DavidDow_2012X@1014.7:1016.27 I SAID I DON 'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
DavidDow_2012X@1016.65:1018.47 FROM WHEN I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD
DavidDow_2012X@1018.68:1020.94 MAYBE YOU JUST REMEMBER SOMEBODY TELLING YOU
DavidDow_2012X@1047.11:1048.72 HE LOOKED AT ME AND HE SAID
DavidDow_2012X@1049.2:1051.18 THAT 'S SOMETHING YOU DON 'T FORGET
DavidDow_2012X@1052.39:1054.68 I HOPE THERE 'S ONE THING YOU ALL WON 'T FORGET
DavidDow_2012X@1074.95:1077.69 IF WE MAKE THE PICTURE BIGGER
DavidDow_2012X@1085.95:1087.83 THAT BEGINS THE DEATH PENALTY STORY
