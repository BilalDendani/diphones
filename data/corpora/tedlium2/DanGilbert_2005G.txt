DanGilbert_2005G@24.43:32.40 AND SURELY IF SOMEBODY COULD REALLY TELL US HOW TO DO EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING AT ALL POSSIBLE TIMES THAT WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS GIFT
DanGilbert_2005G@41.26:50.28 WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY IS WHAT THAT GIFT IS AND I ALSO WANT TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY IT IS THAT IT HASN'T MADE A DAMN BIT OF DIFFERENCE
DanGilbert_2005G@50.64:58.75 NOW THIS IS BERNOULLI 'S GIFT THIS IS A DIRECT QUOTE AND IF IT LOOKS LIKE GREEK TO YOU IT'S BECAUSE WELL IT'S GREEK
DanGilbert_2005G@59.51:72.59 BUT THE SIMPLE ENGLISH TRANSLATION MUCH LESS PRECISE BUT IT CAPTURES THE GIST OF WHAT BERNOULLI HAD TO SAY WAS THIS THE EXPECTED VALUE OF ANY OF OUR ACTIONS THAT IS THE GOODNESS THAT WE CAN COUNT ON GETTING
DanGilbert_2005G@72.97:82.06 IS THE PRODUCT OF TWO SIMPLE THINGS THE ODDS THAT THIS ACTION WILL ALLOW US TO GAIN SOMETHING AND THE VALUE OF THAT GAIN TO US
DanGilbert_2005G@82.55:90.53 IN A SENSE WHAT BERNOULLI WAS SAYING IS IF WE CAN ESTIMATE AND MULTIPLY THESE TWO THINGS WE WILL ALWAYS KNOW PRECISELY HOW WE SHOULD BEHAVE
DanGilbert_2005G@90.88:97.61 NOW THIS SIMPLE EQUATION EVEN FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T LIKE EQUATIONS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE QUITE USED TO HERE 'S AN EXAMPLE
DanGilbert_2005G@112.80:126.66 THE ODDS OF YOU WINNING ARE ONE HALF THE GAIN IF YOU DO IS TEN DOLLARS THAT MULTIPLIES TO FIVE AND THAT'S MORE THAN I'M CHARGING YOU TO PLAY SO THE ANSWER IS YES THIS IS WHAT STATISTICIANS TECHNICALLY CALL A DAMN FINE BET
DanGilbert_2005G@127.03:139.68 NOW THE IDEA IS SIMPLE WHEN WE'RE APPLYING IT TO COIN TOSSES BUT IN FACT IT'S NOT VERY SIMPLE IN EVERYDAY LIFE PEOPLE ARE HORRIBLE AT ESTIMATING BOTH OF THESE THINGS AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY
DanGilbert_2005G@140.04:148.01 THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF ERRORS PEOPLE MAKE WHEN TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT THE RIGHT THING IS TO DO AND THOSE ARE ERRORS IN ESTIMATING THE ODDS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SUCCEED
DanGilbert_2005G@148.57:155.48 ERRORS IN ESTIMATING THE VALUE OF THEIR OWN SUCCESS NOW LET ME TALK ABOUT THE FIRST ONE FIRST
DanGilbert_2005G@167.73:181.82 BUT AS IT TURNS OUT THIS IS NOT A VERY EASY IDEA TO APPLY IN EVERYDAY LIFE THAT'S WHY AMERICANS SPEND MORE I SHOULD SAY LOSE MORE GAMBLING THAN ON ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT COMBINED
DanGilbert_2005G@182.95:192.60 THE REASON IS THIS ISN'T HOW PEOPLE DO ODDS THE WAY PEOPLE FIGURE ODDS REQUIRES THAT WE FIRST TALK A BIT ABOUT PIGS NOW THE QUESTION I'M GOING TO PUT TO YOU IS WHETHER YOU THINK
DanGilbert_2005G@192.88:204.97 THERE ARE MORE DOGS OR PIGS ON LEASHES OBSERVED IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY IN OXFORD AND OF COURSE YOU ALL KNOW THAT THE ANSWER IS DOGS AND THE WAY THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE ANSWER IS DOGS IS YOU QUICKLY REVIEWED IN MEMORY
DanGilbert_2005G@205.21:219.56 THE TIMES YOU'VE SEEN DOGS AND PIGS ON LEASHES IT WAS VERY EASY TO REMEMBER SEEING DOGS NOT SO EASY TO REMEMBER PIGS AND EACH ONE OF YOU ASSUMED THAT IF DOGS ON LEASHES CAME MORE QUICKLY TO YOUR MIND THEN DOGS ON LEASHES ARE MORE PROBABLE
DanGilbert_2005G@219.90:231.75 THAT'S NOT A BAD RULE OF THUMB EXCEPT WHEN IT IS SO FOR EXAMPLE HERE 'S A WORD PUZZLE ARE THERE MORE FOUR LETTER ENGLISH WORDS WITH R IN THE THIRD PLACE OR R IN THE FIRST PLACE
DanGilbert_2005G@232.57:241.67 YOU CHECK MEMORY VERY BRIEFLY MAKE A QUICK SCAN AND IT'S AWFULLY EASY TO SAY TO YOURSELF RING RANG RUNG AND VERY HARD TO SAY TO YOURSELF PARE
DanGilbert_2005G@242.72:250.09 PARK THEY COME MORE SLOWLY BUT IN FACT THERE ARE MANY MORE WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE WITH R IN THE THIRD THAN THE FIRST PLACE
DanGilbert_2005G@250.46:257.33 THE REASON WORDS WITH R IN THE THIRD PLACE COME SLOWLY TO YOUR MIND ISN'T BECAUSE THEY'RE IMPROBABLE UNLIKELY OR INFREQUENT
DanGilbert_2005G@257.72:267.88 IT'S BECAUSE THE MIND RECALLS WORDS BY THEIR FIRST LETTER YOU KIND OF SHOUT OUT THE SOUND S AND THE WORD COMES IT'S LIKE THE DICTIONARY IT'S HARD TO LOOK THINGS UP BY THE THIRD LETTER
DanGilbert_2005G@268.18:276.02 SO THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS IDEA THAT THE QUICKNESS WITH WHICH THINGS COME TO MIND CAN GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THEIR PROBABILITY HOW THIS IDEA COULD LEAD YOU ASTRAY
DanGilbert_2005G@276.37:285.79 IT'S NOT JUST PUZZLES THOUGH FOR EXAMPLE WHEN AMERICANS ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE ODDS THAT THEY WILL DIE IN A VARIETY OF INTERESTING WAYS THESE ARE ESTIMATES
DanGilbert_2005G@306.23:316.26 TWO THINGS ARE VASTLY UNDERESTIMATED DYING BY DROWNING AND DYING BY ASTHMA WHY WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT YOU PICKED UP A NEWSPAPER AND THE HEADLINE WAS BOY DIES
DanGilbert_2005G@317.24:324.16 IT'S NOT INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S SO COMMON IT'S VERY EASY FOR ALL OF US TO BRING TO MIND INSTANCES OF
DanGilbert_2005G@324.48:332.83 NEWS STORIES OR NEWSREELS WHERE WE'VE SEEN TORNADOES DEVASTATING CITIES OR SOME POOR SCHMUCK WHO 'S BLOWN HIS HANDS OFF WITH A FIREWORK ON THE FOURTH OF JULY
DanGilbert_2005G@334.30:344.55 AND ASTHMA DEATHS DON'T GET MUCH COVERAGE THEY DON'T COME QUICKLY TO MIND AND AS A RESULT WE VASTLY UNDERESTIMATE THEM INDEED THIS IS KIND OF LIKE THE SESAME STREET GAME OF WHICH THING DOESN'T BELONG
DanGilbert_2005G@359.28:367.07 THE LOTTERY IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF COURSE AN EXCELLENT TEST CASE OF PEOPLE 'S ABILITY TO COMPUTE PROBABILITIES AND ECONOMISTS
DanGilbert_2005G@367.60:378.94 FORGIVE ME FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO PLAY THE LOTTERY BUT ECONOMISTS AT LEAST AMONG THEMSELVES REFER TO THE LOTTERY AS A STUPIDITY TAX BECAUSE THE ODDS OF GETTING ANY PAYOFF BY INVESTING YOUR MONEY IN A LOTTERY TICKET
DanGilbert_2005G@379.19:386.71 ARE APPROXIMATELY EQUIVALENT TO FLUSHING THE MONEY DIRECTLY DOWN THE TOILET WHICH BY THE WAY DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT YOU ACTUALLY GO TO THE STORE AND BUY ANYTHING
DanGilbert_2005G@387.40:394.89 WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD ANYBODY EVER PLAY THE LOTTERY WELL THERE ARE MANY ANSWERS BUT ONE ANSWER SURELY IS WE SEE A LOT OF WINNERS
DanGilbert_2005G@395.29:403.33 RIGHT WHEN THIS COUPLE WINS THE LOTTERY OR ED MCMAHON SHOWS UP AT YOUR DOOR WITH THIS GIANT CHECK HOW THE HELL DO YOU CASH THINGS THAT SIZE I DON'T KNOW
DanGilbert_2005G@403.61:412.00 WE SEE THIS ON TV WE READ ABOUT IT IN THE PAPER WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT YOU SAW EXTENSIVE INTERVIEWS WITH EVERYBODY WHO LOST INDEED
DanGilbert_2005G@412.57:426.75 IF WE WE REQUIRED THAT TELEVISION STATIONS RUN A THIRTY SECOND INTERVIEW WITH EACH LOSER EVERY TIME THEY INTERVIEW A WINNER THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION LOSERS IN THE LAST LOTTERY WOULD REQUIRE NINE AND A HALF YEARS OF YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION JUST TO WATCH THEM SAY
DanGilbert_2005G@427.35:438.32 ME I LOST ME I LOST NOW IF YOU WATCH NINE AND A HALF YEARS OF TELEVISION NO SLEEP NO POTTY BREAKS AND YOU SAW LOSS AFTER LOSS AFTER LOSS AND THEN AT THE END THERE'S THIRTY SECONDS OF AND I WON
DanGilbert_2005G@438.74:446.10 THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU WOULD PLAY THE LOTTERY IS VERY SMALL LOOK I CAN PROVE THIS TO YOU HERE 'S A LITTLE LOTTERY THERE'S TEN TICKETS IN THIS LOTTERY
DanGilbert_2005G@446.44:453.95 NINE OF THEM HAVE BEEN SOLD TO THESE INDIVIDUALS IT COSTS YOU A DOLLAR TO BUY THE TICKET AND IF YOU WIN YOU GET TWENTY BUCKS IS THIS A GOOD BET
DanGilbert_2005G@454.33:463.46 WELL BERNOULLI TELLS US IT IS THE EXPECTED VALUE OF THIS LOTTERY IS TWO DOLLARS THIS IS A LOTTERY IN WHICH YOU SHOULD INVEST YOUR MONEY AND MOST PEOPLE SAY OK I'LL PLAY
DanGilbert_2005G@473.64:484.89 MOST PEOPLE WON 'T PLAY THIS LOTTERY NOW YOU CAN SEE THE ODDS OF WINNING HAVEN'T CHANGED BUT IT'S NOW FANTASTICALLY EASY TO IMAGINE WHO 'S GOING TO WIN IT'S EASY TO SEE LEROY GETTING THE CHECK
DanGilbert_2005G@485.30:496.89 RIGHT YOU CAN'T SAY TO YOURSELF I 'M AS LIKELY TO WIN AS ANYBODY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT AS LIKELY TO WIN AS LEROY THE FACT THAT ALL THOSE TICKETS ARE OWNED BY ONE GUY CHANGES YOUR DECISION TO PLAY EVEN THOUGH IT DOES NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO THE ODDS
DanGilbert_2005G@497.50:509.18 NOW ESTIMATING ODDS AS DIFFICULT AS IT MAY SEEM IS A PIECE OF CAKE COMPARED TO TRYING TO ESTIMATE VALUE TRYING TO SAY WHAT SOMETHING IS WORTH HOW MUCH WE'LL ENJOY IT HOW MUCH PLEASURE IT WILL GIVE US
DanGilbert_2005G@521.47:534.11 BUT IN FACT TO DECIDE WHETHER A BIG MAC IS WORTH TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS REQUIRES THAT YOU ASK ONE AND ONLY ONE QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT ELSE CAN I DO WITH TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS IF YOU'VE EVER GOTTEN ON ONE OF THOSE LONG HAUL FLIGHTS TO AUSTRALIA
DanGilbert_2005G@534.63:540.55 AND REALIZED THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SERVE YOU ANY FOOD BUT SOMEBODY IN THE ROW IN FRONT OF YOU HAS JUST OPENED THE MCDONALD 'S BAG
DanGilbert_2005G@540.88:550.42 AND THE SMELL OF GOLDEN ARCHES IS WAFTING OVER THE SEAT YOU THINK I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE WITH THIS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR SIXTEEN HOURS I CAN'T EVEN SET IT ON FIRE THEY TOOK MY CIGARETTE LIGHTER
DanGilbert_2005G@551.58:558.61 SUDDENLY TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR A BIG MAC MIGHT BE A GOOD DEAL ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU'RE VISITING AN UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRY AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS BUYS YOU A GOURMET MEAL
DanGilbert_2005G@568.23:577.73 MOST OF YOU COMPARED THE PRICE OF THIS BIG MAC TO THE PRICE YOU'RE USED TO PAYING RATHER THAN ASKING WHAT ELSE CAN I DO WITH MY MONEY COMPARING THIS INVESTMENT TO OTHER POSSIBLE INVESTMENTS
DanGilbert_2005G@578.02:584.66 YOU COMPARED TO THE PAST AND THIS IS A SYSTEMATIC ERROR PEOPLE MAKE WHAT YOU KNEW IS YOU PAID THREE DOLLARS IN THE PAST
DanGilbert_2005G@593.34:600.97 THIS IS OF COURSE ONE OF THE MOST DELICIOUS TRICKS IN MARKETING IS TO SAY SOMETHING USED TO BE HIGHER AND SUDDENLY IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY GOOD DEAL
DanGilbert_2005G@662.40:674.38 THIS TENDENCY TO COMPARE TO THE PAST IS CAUSING PEOPLE TO PASS UP THE BETTER DEAL IN OTHER WORDS A GOOD DEAL THAT USED TO BE A GREAT DEAL IS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS AN AWFUL DEAL THAT WAS ONCE A HORRIBLE DEAL
DanGilbert_2005G@675.18:688.40 HERE 'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW COMPARING TO THE PAST CAN BEFUDDLE OUR DECISIONS IMAGINE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO THE THEATER YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY TO THE THEATER IN YOUR WALLET YOU HAVE A TICKET FOR WHICH YOU PAID TWENTY DOLLARS YOU ALSO HAVE A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
DanGilbert_2005G@688.78:698.79 WHEN YOU ARRIVE AT THE THEATER YOU DISCOVER THAT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY YOU'VE LOST THE TICKET WOULD YOU SPEND YOUR REMAINING MONEY ON REPLACING IT MOST PEOPLE ANSWER NO
DanGilbert_2005G@699.33:707.51 NOW LET 'S JUST CHANGE ONE THING IN THIS SCENARIO YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY TO THE THEATER AND IN YOUR WALLET YOU HAVE TWO TWENTY DOLLAR BILLS WHEN YOU ARRIVE YOU DISCOVER YOU'VE LOST ONE OF THEM
DanGilbert_2005G@719.21:721.93 OF WHAT HAPPENED OK ALONG
DanGilbert_2005G@722.56:730.66 LOST SOMETHING IN BOTH CASES IT WAS A PIECE OF PAPER IN ONE CASE IT HAD A U S PRESIDENT ON IT IN THE OTHER CASE IT DIDN 'T WHAT THE HELL DIFFERENCE SHOULD IT MAKE
DanGilbert_2005G@731.00:743.47 THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WHEN YOU LOST THE TICKET YOU SAY TO YOURSELF I'M NOT PAYING TWICE FOR THE SAME THING YOU COMPARE THE COST OF THE PLAY NOW FORTY DOLLARS TO THE COST THAT IT USED TO HAVE TWENTY DOLLARS AND YOU SAY IT'S A BAD DEAL
DanGilbert_2005G@744.43:753.22 COMPARING WITH THE PAST CAUSES MANY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT BEHAVIORAL ECONOMISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS IDENTIFY IN PEOPLE 'S ATTEMPTS TO ASSIGN VALUE
DanGilbert_2005G@770.36:780.37 THIS FELLOW GEORGE BUSH FOR THOSE OF US WHO WERE KIND OF ON THE LIBERAL SIDE OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM DIDN'T SEEM LIKE SUCH A GREAT GUY SUDDENLY WE'RE ALMOST LONGING FOR HIM TO RETURN
DanGilbert_2005G@780.82:782.98 THE COMPARISON
DanGilbert_2005G@803.29:816.82 MOST PEOPLE DON'T WANT THE MOST EXPENSIVE THEY DON'T WANT THE LEAST EXPENSIVE SO THEY WILL OPT FOR THE ITEM IN THE MIDDLE IF YOU'RE A SMART RETAILER THEN YOU WILL PUT A VERY EXPENSIVE ITEM THAT NOBODY WILL EVER BUY ON THE SHELF BECAUSE SUDDENLY THE THIRTY THREE DOLLAR WINE
DanGilbert_2005G@817.18:824.40 DOESN'T LOOK AS EXPENSIVE IN COMPARISON SO I'M TELLING YOU SOMETHING YOU ALREADY KNEW NAMELY THAT
DanGilbert_2005G@849.04:856.56 THIS PROBLEM OF SHIFTING COMPARISONS CAN BEDEVIL OUR ATTEMPTS TO MAKE RATIONAL DECISIONS LET ME JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
DanGilbert_2005G@856.80:867.90 I HAVE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING FROM MY OWN LAB SO LET ME SNEAK THIS IN THESE ARE SUBJECTS COMING TO AN EXPERIMENT TO BE ASKED THE SIMPLEST OF ALL QUESTIONS HOW MUCH WILL YOU ENJOY EATING POTATO CHIPS ONE MINUTE FROM NOW
DanGilbert_2005G@879.47:886.53 IN FACT THESE ITEMS THAT ARE SITTING IN THE ROOM CHANGE HOW MUCH THE SUBJECTS THINK THEY'RE GOING TO ENJOY THE POTATO CHIPS NAMELY
DanGilbert_2005G@886.90:896.47 THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING AT SPAM THINK POTATO CHIPS ARE GOING TO BE QUITE TASTY THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING AT GODIVA CHOCOLATE THINK THEY WON 'T BE NEARLY SO TASTY OF COURSE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY EAT THE POTATO CHIPS
DanGilbert_2005G@896.87:908.62 WELL LOOK YOU DIDN'T NEED A PSYCHOLOGIST TO TELL YOU THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A MOUTHFUL OF GREASY SALTY CRISPY DELICIOUS SNACKS WHAT'S SITTING IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM MAKES NOT A DAMN BIT OF DIFFERENCE TO YOUR GUSTATORY EXPERIENCE
DanGilbert_2005G@917.27:930.66 ALL EXPERIENCED THIS YOURSELF EVEN IF YOU'VE NEVER COME INTO OUR LAB TO EAT POTATO CHIPS SO HERE 'S A QUESTION YOU WANT TO BUY A CAR STEREO THE DEALER NEAR YOUR HOUSE SELLS THIS PARTICULAR STEREO FOR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT IF YOU DRIVE ACROSS TOWN
DanGilbert_2005G@943.04:953.81 NOW LET 'S IMAGINE INSTEAD YOU WANTED TO BUY A CAR THAT HAD A STEREO AND THE DEALER NEAR YOUR HOUSE HAD IT FOR THIRTY ONE THOUSAND BUT IF YOU DROVE ACROSS TOWN YOU COULD GET IT FOR THIRTY THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED
DanGilbert_2005G@967.10:974.75 BECAUSE THIS ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT YOU SAVE HELLO DOESN'T KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM IT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT YOU SAVED IT ON
DanGilbert_2005G@974.96:983.60 WHEN YOU GO TO BUY GROCERIES WITH IT IT DOESN'T GO I'M THE MONEY SAVED ON THE CAR STEREO OR I'M THE DUMB MONEY SAVED ON THE CAR IT'S MONEY
DanGilbert_2005G@983.88:988.52 AND IF A DRIVE ACROSS TOWN IS WORTH ONE HUNDRED BUCKS IT'S WORTH ONE HUNDRED BUCKS NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE SAVING
DanGilbert_2005G@1000.87:1012.32 YOU CAN SEE THIS IS THE PROBLEM OF SHIFTING COMPARISONS BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE COMPARING THE ONE HUNDRED BUCKS TO THE PURCHASE THAT YOU'RE MAKING BUT WHEN YOU GO TO SPEND THAT MONEY YOU WON 'T BE MAKING THAT COMPARISON
DanGilbert_2005G@1012.72:1021.79 ALL HAD THIS EXPERIENCE IF YOU'RE AN AMERICAN FOR EXAMPLE YOU'VE PROBABLY TRAVELED IN FRANCE AND AT SOME POINT YOU MAY HAVE MET A COUPLE FROM YOUR OWN HOMETOWN AND YOU THOUGHT
DanGilbert_2005G@1022.97:1032.34 THESE PEOPLE ARE SO WARM THEY'RE SO NICE TO ME I MEAN COMPARED TO ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO HATE ME WHEN I TRY TO SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGE AND HATE ME MORE WHEN I DON 'T THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST WONDERFUL
DanGilbert_2005G@1040.95:1050.47 RIGHT BECAUSE IN THIS NEW CONTEXT THE COMPARISON IS VERY VERY DIFFERENT IN FACT YOU FIND YOURSELF DISLIKING THEM ENOUGH ALMOST TO QUALIFY FOR FRENCH CITIZENSHIP NOW
DanGilbert_2005G@1051.65:1059.45 YOU HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM WHEN YOU SHOP FOR A STEREO YOU GO TO THE STEREO STORE YOU SEE TWO SETS OF SPEAKERS THESE BIG BOXY MONOLITHS
DanGilbert_2005G@1070.86:1083.19 AND THE PROBLEM OF COURSE IS THAT THIS COMPARISON YOU MADE IN THE STORE IS A COMPARISON YOU'LL NEVER MAKE AGAIN WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT YEARS LATER YOU'LL TURN ON THE STEREO AND GO SOUNDS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THOSE LITTLE ONES WHICH YOU CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER HEARING
DanGilbert_2005G@1083.75:1094.69 THE PROBLEM OF SHIFTING COMPARISONS IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT WHEN THESE CHOICES ARE ARRAYED OVER TIME PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT WILL HAPPEN AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME
DanGilbert_2005G@1107.79:1119.49 YOU CAN HAVE SIXTY DOLLARS NOW OR FIFTY DOLLARS NOW WHICH WOULD YOU PREFER THIS IS WHAT WE CALL A ONE ITEM IQ TEST OK ALL OF US I HOPE PREFER MORE MONEY AND THE REASON IS WE BELIEVE MORE IS BETTER THAN LESS
DanGilbert_2005G@1120.09:1130.42 HERE 'S THE SECOND PROBLEM YOU CAN HAVE SIXTY DOLLARS TODAY OR SIXTY DOLLARS IN A MONTH WHICH WOULD YOU PREFER AGAIN AN EASY DECISION BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT NOW IS BETTER THAN LATER
DanGilbert_2005G@1130.90:1144.01 WHAT'S HARD IN OUR DECISION MAKING IS WHEN THESE TWO RULES CONFLICT FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU'RE OFFERED FIFTY DOLLARS NOW OR SIXTY DOLLARS IN A MONTH THIS TYPIFIES A LOT OF SITUATIONS IN LIFE IN WHICH YOU WILL GAIN BY WAITING BUT YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT
DanGilbert_2005G@1144.41:1152.47 WHAT DO WE KNOW WHAT DO PEOPLE DO IN THESE KINDS OF SITUATIONS WELL BY AND LARGE PEOPLE ARE ENORMOUSLY IMPATIENT THAT IS THEY REQUIRE
DanGilbert_2005G@1162.39:1173.34 MAYBE THAT ISN'T SO REMARKABLE BUT WHAT IS REMARKABLE IS HOW EASY IT IS TO MAKE THIS IMPATIENCE GO AWAY BY SIMPLY CHANGING WHEN THE DELIVERY OF THESE MONETARY UNITS WILL HAPPEN
DanGilbert_2005G@1185.69:1197.15 WHAT MAKES THIS DYNAMIC INCONSISTENCY HAPPEN COMPARISON TROUBLING COMPARISON LET ME SHOW YOU THIS IS JUST A GRAPH SHOWING THE RESULTS THAT I JUST SUGGESTED YOU WOULD SHOW IF I GAVE YOU TIME TO RESPOND
DanGilbert_2005G@1197.44:1206.45 WHICH IS PEOPLE FIND THAT THE SUBJECTIVE VALUE OF FIFTY IS HIGHER THAN THE SUBJECTIVE VALUE OF SIXTY WHEN THEY'LL BE DELIVERED IN NOW OR ONE MONTH RESPECTIVELY A THIRTY DAY DELAY
DanGilbert_2005G@1206.68:1213.50 BUT THEY SHOW THE REVERSE PATTERN WHEN YOU PUSH THE ENTIRE DECISION OFF INTO THE FUTURE A YEAR NOW
DanGilbert_2005G@1214.01:1224.16 WHY IN THE WORLD DO YOU GET THIS PATTERN OF RESULTS THESE GUYS CAN TELL US WHAT YOU SEE HERE ARE TWO LADS ONE OF THEM LARGER THAN THE OTHER THE FIREMAN AND THE FIDDLER
DanGilbert_2005G@1224.65:1233.43 THEY ARE GOING TO RECEDE TOWARDS THE VANISHING POINT IN THE HORIZON AND I WANT YOU TO NOTICE TWO THINGS AT NO POINT WILL THE FIREMAN LOOK TALLER THAN THE FIDDLER
DanGilbert_2005G@1234.13:1245.38 NO POINT HOWEVER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM SEEMS TO BE GETTING SMALLER FIRST IT'S AN INCH IN YOUR VIEW THEN IT'S A QUARTER INCH THEN A HALF INCH AND THEN FINALLY THEY GO OFF THE EDGE OF THE EARTH
DanGilbert_2005G@1245.77:1254.22 HERE ARE THE RESULTS OF WHAT I JUST SHOWED YOU THIS IS THE SUBJECTIVE HEIGHT THE HEIGHT YOU SAW OF THESE GUYS AT VARIOUS POINTS AND I WANT YOU TO SEE
DanGilbert_2005G@1254.41:1263.81 THAT TWO THINGS ARE TRUE ONE THE FARTHER AWAY THEY ARE THE SMALLER THEY LOOK AND TWO THE FIREMAN IS ALWAYS BIGGER THAN THE FIDDLER BUT WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE MAKE SOME OF THEM DISAPPEAR
DanGilbert_2005G@1264.64:1273.70 RIGHT AT A VERY CLOSE DISTANCE THE FIDDLER LOOKS TALLER THAN THE FIREMAN BUT AT A FAR DISTANCE THEIR NORMAL THEIR TRUE RELATIONS ARE PRESERVED
DanGilbert_2005G@1273.95:1283.45 AS PLATO SAID WHAT SPACE IS TO SIZE TIME IS TO VALUE THESE ARE THE RESULTS OF THE HARD PROBLEM I GAVE YOU
DanGilbert_2005G@1284.04:1293.26 SIXTY NOW OR FIFTY IN A MONTH AND THESE ARE SUBJECTIVE VALUES AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS OUR TWO RULES ARE PRESERVED PEOPLE ALWAYS THINK MORE IS BETTER THAN LESS SIXTY IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN FIFTY
DanGilbert_2005G@1293.46:1300.35 AND THEY ALWAYS THINK NOW IS BETTER THAN LATER THE BARS ON THIS SIDE ARE HIGHER THAN THE BARS ON THIS SIDE WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DROP SOME OUT
DanGilbert_2005G@1301.07:1314.36 SUDDENLY WE HAVE THE DYNAMIC INCONSISTENCY THAT PUZZLED US WE HAVE THE TENDENCY FOR PEOPLE TO GO FOR FIFTY DOLLARS NOW OVER WAITING A MONTH BUT NOT IF THAT DECISION IS FAR IN THE FUTURE NOTICE SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT THIS IMPLIES NAMELY
DanGilbert_2005G@1314.73:1327.60 THAT WHEN PEOPLE GET TO THE FUTURE THEY WILL CHANGE THEIR MINDS THAT IS AS THAT MONTH TWELVE APPROACHES YOU WILL SAY WHAT WAS I THINKING WAITING AN EXTRA MONTH FOR SIXTY DOLLARS I'LL TAKE THE FIFTY DOLLARS NOW
DanGilbert_2005G@1328.19:1337.78 WELL THE QUESTION WITH WHICH I'D LIKE TO END IS THIS IF WE'RE SO DAMN STUPID HOW DID WE GET TO THE MOON BECAUSE I COULD GO ON FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS WITH EVIDENCE OF
DanGilbert_2005G@1338.57:1348.34 INABILITY TO ESTIMATE ODDS AND INABILITY TO ESTIMATE VALUE THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION I THINK IS AN ANSWER YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD IN SOME OF THE TALKS AND I DARE SAY YOU WILL HEAR AGAIN NAMELY THAT
DanGilbert_2005G@1348.85:1355.81 OUR BRAINS WERE EVOLVED FOR A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD THAN THE ONE IN WHICH WE ARE LIVING THEY WERE EVOLVED FOR A WORLD IN WHICH PEOPLE LIVED IN
DanGilbert_2005G@1366.13:1371.54 AND MATE TODAY BERNOULLI 'S GIFT BERNOULLI 'S LITTLE FORMULA
DanGilbert_2005G@1372.29:1384.28 ALLOWS US IT TELLS US HOW WE SHOULD THINK IN A WORLD FOR WHICH NATURE NEVER DESIGNED US THAT EXPLAINS WHY WE ARE SO BAD AT USING IT BUT IT ALSO EXPLAINS WHY IT IS SO TERRIBLY IMPORTANT
DanGilbert_2005G@1384.65:1392.18 THAT WE BECOME GOOD FAST WE ARE THE ONLY SPECIES ON THIS PLANET THAT HAS EVER HELD ITS OWN FATE
DanGilbert_2005G@1392.48:1405.91 IN ITS HANDS WE HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT PREDATORS WE'RE THE MASTERS OF OUR PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT THE THINGS THAT NORMALLY CAUSE SPECIES TO BECOME EXTINCT ARE NO LONGER ANY THREAT TO US THE ONLY THING THE ONLY THING
DanGilbert_2005G@1406.25:1416.20 THAT CAN DESTROY US AND DOOM US ARE OUR OWN DECISIONS IF WE'RE NOT HERE IN TEN THOUSAND YEARS IT'S GOING TO BE BECAUSE WE COULD NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE
DanGilbert_2005G@1449.05:1455.80 WOULD YOU SAY THAT THIS MECHANISM IS IN PART HOW TERRORISM ACTUALLY WORKS TO FRIGHTEN US AND IS THERE
DanGilbert_2005G@1477.80:1486.81 AND HOW CAN WE STOP PEOPLE FROM BEING TERRIFIED RATHER THAN NOT RATHER THAN BUT IN ADDITION TO STOPPING THE ATROCITIES THAT WE'RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT SURELY THE KINDS OF
DanGilbert_2005G@1487.72:1496.86 PLAY THAT AT LEAST AMERICAN MEDIA GIVE TO AND FORGIVE ME BUT IN RAW NUMBERS THESE ARE VERY TINY ACCIDENTS WE ALREADY KNOW
DanGilbert_2005G@1506.52:1513.92 IF I TOLD YOU THAT THERE WAS A PLAGUE THAT WAS GOING TO KILL FIFTEEN THOUSAND AMERICANS NEXT YEAR YOU MIGHT BE ALARMED IF YOU DIDN'T FIND OUT IT WAS THE FLU
DanGilbert_2005G@1514.26:1527.77 THESE ARE SMALL SCALE ACCIDENTS AND WE SHOULD BE WONDERING WHETHER THEY SHOULD GET THE KIND OF PLAY THE KIND OF COVERAGE THAT THEY DO SURELY THAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO OVERESTIMATE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY'LL BE HURT IN THESE VARIOUS WAYS AND GIVES POWER TO THE VERY PEOPLE
DanGilbert_2005G@1536.95:1545.05 I MEAN LOOK IF AUSTRALIA DISAPPEARS TOMORROW TERROR IS PROBABLY THE RIGHT RESPONSE THAT'S AN AWFUL LARGE LOT OF VERY NICE PEOPLE
DanGilbert_2005G@1546.19:1556.54 ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN A BUS BLOWS UP AND THIRTY PEOPLE ARE KILLED MORE PEOPLE THAN THAT WERE KILLED BY NOT USING THEIR SEATBELTS IN THE SAME COUNTRY IS TERROR THE RIGHT RESPONSE
DanGilbert_2005G@1564.91:1572.61 YES IT'S A NUMBER OF THINGS AND YOU HIT ON SEVERAL OF THEM FIRST IT'S A HUMAN AGENT TRYING TO KILL US IT'S NOT A TREE FALLING ON US BY ACCIDENT
DanGilbert_2005G@1573.39:1583.93 SECOND THESE ARE ENEMIES WHO MAY WANT TO STRIKE AND HURT US AGAIN PEOPLE ARE BEING KILLED FOR NO REASON INSTEAD OF GOOD REASON AS IF THERE'S GOOD REASON BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE THINK THERE ARE SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT TOGETHER
DanGilbert_2005G@1584.19:1598.53 MAKE THIS SEEM LIKE A FANTASTIC EVENT BUT LET 'S NOT PLAY DOWN THE FACT THAT NEWSPAPERS SELL WHEN PEOPLE SEE SOMETHING IN IT THEY WANT TO READ SO THERE'S A LARGE ROLE HERE PLAYED BY THE MEDIA WHO WANT THESE THINGS TO BE AS SPECTACULAR AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN
DanGilbert_2005G@1599.97:1606.91 WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO PERSUADE OUR CULTURE TO DOWNPLAY IT DG WELL GO TO ISRAEL
DanGilbert_2005G@1614.56:1623.43 HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET FROM THE MALL WHEN IT BLEW UP I WENT BACK TO MY HOTEL AND THE WEDDING THAT WAS PLANNED WAS STILL GOING ON AND AS THE ISRAELI MOTHER SAID SHE SAID WE NEVER LET THEM WIN BY STOPPING
DanGilbert_2005G@1643.40:1654.00 YES OF COURSE SO IF WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS THE WORST ATTACK THERE WOULD EVER BE THERE MIGHT BE MORE AND MORE BUSES OF THIRTY PEOPLE WE WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE NEARLY SO FRIGHTENED I DON'T WANT TO SAY
DanGilbert_2005G@1665.94:1679.24 THREATS SHOULD BE ROUGHLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE SIZE OF THOSE THREATS AND THREATS TO COME I THINK IN THE CASE OF TERRORISM IT ISN 'T AND MANY OF THE THINGS WE'VE HEARD ABOUT FROM OUR SPEAKERS TODAY HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU KNOW GOT UP AND SAID
DanGilbert_2005G@1730.32:1741.10 EVOLVED TO GET ALL EXCITED ABOUT THESE DRAMATIC ATTACKS IS THAT BECAUSE IN THE PAST IN THE ANCIENT PAST WE JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THINGS LIKE DISEASE AND SYSTEMS THAT CAUSE POVERTY AND SO FORTH AND SO IT MADE NO SENSE FOR US
DanGilbert_2005G@1751.93:1766.81 WELL YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST SKEPTICAL ABOUT LEAPING TO EVOLUTIONARY EXPLANATIONS FOR EVERYTHING ARE THE EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGISTS THEMSELVES MY GUESS IS THAT THERE'S NOTHING QUITE THAT SPECIFIC IN OUR EVOLUTIONARY PAST BUT RATHER IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN EVOLUTIONARY EXPLANATION YOU MIGHT SAY THAT
DanGilbert_2005G@1767.41:1779.56 MOST ORGANISMS ARE NEO PHOBIC THAT IS THEY'RE A LITTLE SCARED OF STUFF THAT'S NEW AND DIFFERENT AND THERE'S A GOOD REASON TO BE BECAUSE OLD STUFF DIDN'T EAT YOU RIGHT ANY ANIMAL YOU SEE THAT YOU'VE SEEN BEFORE IS LESS LIKELY TO BE A PREDATOR THAN ONE THAT YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE
DanGilbert_2005G@1780.08:1787.63 SO YOU KNOW WHEN A SCHOOL BUS IS BLOWN UP AND WE'VE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE OUR GENERAL TENDENCY IS TO ORIENT TOWARDS THAT WHICH IS NEW AND NOVEL
