JanetEchelman_2011 IS ABOUT TAKING IMAGINATION SERIOUSLY
JanetEchelman_2011 FOURTEEN YEARS AGO I FIRST ENCOUNTERED THIS ORDINARY MATERIAL FISHNET USED THE SAME WAY FOR CENTURIES TODAY I 'M USING IT TO CREATE PERMANENT BILLOWING VOLUPTUOUS FORMS THE SCALE OF HARD EDGED BUILDINGS IN CITIES AROUND THE WORLD
JanetEchelman_2011 I WAS AN UNLIKELY PERSON TO BE DOING THIS I NEVER STUDIED SCULPTURE ENGINEERING OR ARCHITECTURE
JanetEchelman_2011 IN FACT AFTER COLLEGE I APPLIED TO SEVEN ART SCHOOLS AND WAS REJECTED BY ALL SEVEN I WENT OFF ON MY OWN TO BECOME AN ARTIST AND I PAINTED
JanetEchelman_2011 FOR TEN YEARS WHEN I WAS OFFERED A FULBRIGHT TO INDIA PROMISING TO GIVE EXHIBITIONS OF PAINTINGS I SHIPPED MY PAINTS AND ARRIVED IN MAHABALIPURAM THE DEADLINE FOR THE SHOW ARRIVED
JanetEchelman_2011 MY PAINTS DIDN 'T I HAD TO DO SOMETHING THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMOUS FOR SCULPTURE SO I TRIED BRONZE CASTING
JanetEchelman_2011 BUT TO MAKE LARGE FORMS WAS TOO HEAVY AND EXPENSIVE
JanetEchelman_2011 A NEW APPROACH TO SCULPTURE A WAY TO MAKE VOLUMETRIC FORM WITHOUT HEAVY SOLID MATERIALS MY FIRST SATISFYING SCULPTURE WAS MADE IN COLLABORATION WITH THESE FISHERMEN
JanetEchelman_2011 IT 'S A SELF PORTRAIT TITLED WIDE HIPS
JanetEchelman_2011 I DISCOVERED THEIR SOFT SURFACES REVEALED EVERY RIPPLE OF WIND IN CONSTANTLY CHANGING PATTERNS I WAS MESMERIZED
JanetEchelman_2011 I CONTINUED STUDYING CRAFT TRADITIONS AND COLLABORATING WITH ARTISANS NEXT IN LITHUANIA WITH LACE MAKERS I LIKED THE FINE DETAIL IT GAVE MY WORK
JanetEchelman_2011 BUT I WANTED TO MAKE THEM LARGER TO SHIFT FROM BEING AN OBJECT YOU LOOK AT
JanetEchelman_2011 TO SOMETHING YOU COULD GET LOST IN RETURNING TO INDIA TO WORK WITH THOSE FISHERMEN WE MADE A NET OF A MILLION AND A HALF HAND TIED KNOTS
JanetEchelman_2011 HE ASKED IF I COULD BUILD THIS AS A PERMANENT PIECE FOR THE CITY I DIDN 'T KNOW IF I COULD DO THAT AND PRESERVE MY ART DURABLE
JanetEchelman_2011 ENGINEERED PERMANENT THOSE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO IDIOSYNCRATIC DELICATE AND EPHEMERAL
JanetEchelman_2011 FOR TWO YEARS I SEARCHED FOR A FIBER THAT COULD SURVIVE ULTRAVIOLET RAYS SALT AIR POLLUTION AND AT THE SAME TIME REMAIN SOFT ENOUGH TO MOVE FLUIDLY IN THE WIND
JanetEchelman_2011 WE NEEDED SOMETHING TO HOLD THE NET UP OUT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TRAFFIC CIRCLE SO WE RAISED THIS FORTY FIVE THOUSAND POUND STEEL RING
JanetEchelman_2011 WE HAD TO ENGINEER IT TO MOVE GRACEFULLY IN AN AVERAGE BREEZE AND SURVIVE IN HURRICANE WINDS BUT THERE WAS NO ENGINEERING SOFTWARE TO MODEL SOMETHING POROUS AND MOVING
JanetEchelman_2011 HE HELPED ME TACKLE THE TWIN CHALLENGES OF PRECISE SHAPE
JanetEchelman_2011 AND GENTLE MOVEMENT
JanetEchelman_2011 I COULDN 'T BUILD THIS THE WAY I KNEW BECAUSE HAND TIED KNOTS WEREN 'T GOING TO WITHSTAND A HURRICANE SO I DEVELOPED A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN INDUSTRIAL FISHNET FACTORY LEARNED THE VARIABLES OF THEIR MACHINES AND FIGURED OUT A WAY TO MAKE LACE WITH THEM
JanetEchelman_2011 THERE WAS NO LANGUAGE TO TRANSLATE THIS ANCIENT IDIOSYNCRATIC HANDCRAFT INTO SOMETHING MACHINE OPERATORS COULD PRODUCE SO WE HAD TO CREATE ONE
JanetEchelman_2011 THREE YEARS AND TWO CHILDREN LATER
JanetEchelman_2011 WE RAISED THIS FIFTY THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT LACE NET
JanetEchelman_2011 IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT WHAT I HAD IMAGINED WAS NOW BUILT
JanetEchelman_2011 NOW IT HAD A SENSE OF PLACE
JanetEchelman_2011 I WALKED UNDERNEATH IT FOR THE FIRST TIME
JanetEchelman_2011 AS I WATCHED THE WIND 'S CHOREOGRAPHY UNFOLD I FELT SHELTERED AND AT THE SAME TIME CONNECTED TO LIMITLESS SKY
JanetEchelman_2011 MY LIFE WAS NOT GOING TO BE THE SAME
JanetEchelman_2011 I WANT TO CREATE THESE OASES OF SCULPTURE IN SPACES OF CITIES AROUND THE WORLD
JanetEchelman_2011 I 'M GOING TO SHARE TWO DIRECTIONS THAT ARE NEW IN MY WORK
JanetEchelman_2011 HISTORIC PHILADELPHIA CITY HALL ITS PLAZA I FELT NEEDED A MATERIAL FOR SCULPTURE THAT WAS LIGHTER THAN NETTING SO WE EXPERIMENTED WITH TINY ATOMIZED WATER PARTICLES TO CREATE A DRY MIST THAT IS SHAPED BY THE WIND
JanetEchelman_2011 AND IN TESTING DISCOVERED THAT IT CAN BE SHAPED BY PEOPLE
JanetEchelman_2011 WHO CAN INTERACT AND MOVE THROUGH IT WITHOUT GETTING WET
JanetEchelman_2011 I 'M USING THIS SCULPTURE MATERIAL TO TRACE THE PATHS OF SUBWAY TRAINS ABOVE GROUND IN REAL TIME
JanetEchelman_2011 LIKE AN X RAY OF THE CITY 'S CIRCULATORY SYSTEM UNFOLDING
JanetEchelman_2011 NEXT CHALLENGE THE BIENNIAL OF THE AMERICAS IN DENVER ASKED COULD I REPRESENT THE THIRTY FIVE NATIONS OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE AND THEIR INTERCONNECTEDNESS IN A SCULPTURE
JanetEchelman_2011 AND THE TSUNAMI THAT RIPPLED ACROSS THE ENTIRE PACIFIC OCEAN IT SHIFTED THE EARTH 'S TECTONIC PLATES SPED UP THE PLANET 'S ROTATION AND LITERALLY SHORTENED THE LENGTH OF THE DAY
JanetEchelman_2011 SO I CONTACTED NOAA AND I ASKED IF THEY 'D SHARE THEIR DATA ON THE TSUNAMI AND TRANSLATED IT INTO THIS
JanetEchelman_2011 ITS TITLE ONE POINT TWO SIX REFERS TO THE NUMBER OF MICROSECONDS THAT THE EARTH 'S DAY WAS SHORTENED I COULDN 'T BUILD THIS WITH A STEEL RING THE WAY I KNEW ITS SHAPE WAS TOO COMPLEX NOW
JanetEchelman_2011 SO I REPLACED THE METAL ARMATURE WITH A SOFT FINE MESH OF A FIBER FIFTEEN TIMES STRONGER THAN STEEL
JanetEchelman_2011 THE SCULPTURE COULD NOW BE ENTIRELY SOFT WHICH MADE IT SO LIGHT IT COULD TIE IN TO EXISTING BUILDINGS
JanetEchelman_2011 LITERALLY BECOMING PART OF THE FABRIC OF THE CITY THERE WAS NO SOFTWARE THAT COULD EXTRUDE THESE COMPLEX NET FORMS AND MODEL THEM WITH GRAVITY
JanetEchelman_2011 SO WE HAD TO CREATE IT
JanetEchelman_2011 THEN I GOT A CALL FROM NEW YORK CITY
JanetEchelman_2011 ASKING IF I COULD ADAPT THESE CONCEPTS
JanetEchelman_2011 TO TIMES SQUARE
JanetEchelman_2011 FOURTEEN YEARS AGO
JanetEchelman_2011 I SEARCHED FOR BEAUTY
JanetEchelman_2011 IN THE TRADITIONAL THINGS IN CRAFT FORMS
JanetEchelman_2011 NOW I COMBINE THEM WITH HI TECH MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING
JanetEchelman_2011 TO CREATE VOLUPTUOUS BILLOWING FORMS THE SCALE OF BUILDINGS
JanetEchelman_2011 MY ARTISTIC HORIZONS CONTINUE TO GROW I 'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS STORY
JanetEchelman_2011 I GOT A CALL FROM A FRIEND IN PHOENIX
JanetEchelman_2011 NEVER VISITED THE LOCAL ART MUSEUM
JanetEchelman_2011 SHARING THE REDISCOVERY OF WONDER
