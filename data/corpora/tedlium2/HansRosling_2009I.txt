HansRosling_2009I ONCE UPON A TIME AT THE AGE OF TWENTY FOUR I WAS A STUDENT AT ST JOHN 'S MEDICAL COLLEGE IN BANGALORE
HansRosling_2009I I WAS A GUEST STUDENT DURING ONE MONTH OF A PUBLIC HEALTH COURSE AND THAT CHANGED MY MINDSET FOREVER THE COURSE WAS GOOD
HansRosling_2009I THE INDIAN STUDENTS WERE BETTER THAN ME
HansRosling_2009I I WAS A STUDY NERD I LOVED STATISTICS FROM A YOUNG AGE AND I STUDIED VERY MUCH IN SWEDEN I USED TO BE IN THE
HansRosling_2009I QUARTER OF ALL COURSES I ATTENDED BUT IN ST JOHN 'S I WAS IN THE LOWER QUARTER AND THE
HansRosling_2009I TO ME THAT PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WAS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE THAT THE MINDSET I GREW UP WITH WAS
HansRosling_2009I AND I REALIZED THAT PERHAPS THE WESTERN WORLD WILL NOT CONTINUE TO DOMINATE THE WORLD FOREVER
HansRosling_2009I I THINK MANY OF YOU HAVE THE SAME SORT OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IT'S THAT REALIZATION OF SOMEONE YOU MEET THAT REALLY MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR IDEAS ABOUT THE WORLD IT'S NOT THE STATISTICS ALTHOUGH I TRIED TO MAKE
HansRosling_2009I AND I WILL NOW HERE ONSTAGE TRY TO PREDICT WHEN THAT
HansRosling_2009I ITS DOMINANT POSITION AS THE LEADING PART OF THE WORLD AS IT USED TO BE OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
HansRosling_2009I I WILL DO THAT BY TRYING TO PREDICT PRECISELY AT WHAT YEAR THE AVERAGE INCOME
HansRosling_2009I PER PERSON IN INDIA IN CHINA WILL REACH THAT OF THE WEST AND I DON'T MEAN THE WHOLE ECONOMY BECAUSE TO GROW AN ECONOMY OF INDIA TO THE SIZE OF U K THAT'S A PIECE OF CAKE WITH ONE BILLION PEOPLE
HansRosling_2009I BUT I WANT TO SEE WHEN WILL THE AVERAGE PAY THE MONEY FOR EACH PERSON PER MONTH IN INDIA AND CHINA WHEN WILL THAT HAVE REACHED THAT OF U K AND THE UNITED STATES BUT I
HansRosling_2009I THAT WAS THE YEAR WHEN QUEEN VICTORIA WAS ABLE FOR THE FIRST TIME TO COMMUNICATE WITH PRESIDENT BUCHANAN THROUGH THE TRANSATLANTIC TELEGRAPHIC CABLE AND THEY WERE THE FIRST TO TWITTER
HansRosling_2009I AND I'VE BEEN ABLE THROUGH THIS WONDERFUL GOOGLE AND INTERNET TO FIND THE TEXT OF THE TELEGRAM SENT BACK FROM PRESIDENT BUCHANAN TO QUEEN VICTORIA AND IT ENDS LIKE THIS
HansRosling_2009I THIS TELEGRAPH IS A FANTASTIC INSTRUMENT TO DIFFUSE RELIGION CIVILIZATION LIBERTY AND LAW THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THOSE ARE NICE WORDS BUT I GOT SORT OF CURIOUS OF WHAT HE MEANT WITH LIBERTY AND LIBERTY FOR WHOM
HansRosling_2009I FIFTY EIGHT WAS THE YEAR WHEN THE COURAGEOUS UPRISING AGAINST THE FOREIGN OCCUPATION OF INDIA WAS DEFEATED BY THE BRITISH FORCES
HansRosling_2009I FIFTY EIGHT IN JAPAN WAS THE YEAR WHEN JAPAN HAD TO SIGN THE HARRIS TREATY AND ACCEPT TRADE ON FAVORABLE CONDITION FOR THE U S AND THEY WERE THREATENED BY THOSE BLACK SHIPS THERE THAT HAD BEEN IN
HansRosling_2009I TOKYO HARBOR OVER THE LAST YEAR BUT JAPAN IN CONTRAST TO INDIA AND CHINA MAINTAINED ITS NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND LET 'S SEE HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE THAT CAN MAKE AND I WILL DO THAT
HansRosling_2009I BY BRINGING THESE BUBBLES BACK TO A GAPMINDER GRAPH HERE WHERE YOU CAN SEE EACH BUBBLE IS A COUNTRY THE SIZE OF THE BUBBLE HERE IS THE POPULATION ON THIS AXIS AS I USED TO HAVE INCOME PER PERSON IN COMPARABLE DOLLAR
HansRosling_2009I AND ON THAT AXIS I HAVE LIFE EXPECTANCY THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE AND I ALSO BRING AN INNOVATION HERE I HAVE TRANSFORMED THE
HansRosling_2009I WE WILL SEE YOU KNOW
HansRosling_2009I DOWN HERE CAN YOU SEE HOW IT STARTS TO MOVE THERE BUT REALLY REALLY NATURAL SOVEREIGNTY WAS GOOD FOR JAPAN AND JAPAN IS TRYING TO MOVE UP THERE AND IT'S THE NEW CENTURY NOW HEALTH IS GETTING BETTER UNITED KINGDOM UNITED STATES
HansRosling_2009I BUT CAREFUL NOW WE ARE APPROACHING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE FIRST WORLD WAR YOU KNOW WE'LL SEE A LOT OF DEATHS AND ECONOMICAL PROBLEMS HERE UNITED KINGDOM IS GOING DOWN AND NOW
HansRosling_2009I COMES THE SPANISH FLU ALSO AND THEN AFTER THE FIRST WORLD WAR
HansRosling_2009I THEY CONTINUE UP STILL UNDER FOREIGN DOMINATION AND WITHOUT SOVEREIGNTY INDIA AND CHINA ARE DOWN IN THE CORNER NOT MUCH HAS HAPPENED THEY HAVE GROWN THEIR POPULATION BUT NOT MUCH MORE
HansRosling_2009I SEVEN INDIA FINALLY GAINED ITS INDEPENDENCE AND THEY COULD RAISE THE INDIAN FLAG AND BECOME A SOVEREIGN NATION
HansRosling_2009I WE SAW THE EMERGENCE OF THE MODERN CHINA IN A WAY WHICH SURPRISED THE WORLD AND WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENS IN THE AFTER INDEPENDENCE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE HEALTH STARTED TO IMPROVE CHILDREN STARTED TO GO TO SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICES WERE
HansRosling_2009I THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD WHEN CHINA FELL DOWN IT WAS CENTRAL PLANNING BY MAO TSE TUNG CHINA RECOVERED THEN THEY SAID NEVERMORE STUPID CENTRAL PLANNING
HansRosling_2009I WENT UP HERE AND INDIA WAS TRYING TO FOLLOW AND THEY WERE CATCHING UP INDEED AND BOTH COUNTRIES HAD THE BETTER HEALTH BUT STILL A VERY LOW ECONOMY
HansRosling_2009I IF A CAT IS WHITE OR BLACK AS LONG AS IT CATCHES MICE BECAUSE
HansRosling_2009I IS WHAT THE TWO CATS WANTED TO DO AND YOU CAN SEE THE TWO CATS BEING HERE CHINA AND INDIA WANTING TO CATCH THE MICES OVER THERE YOU KNOW
HansRosling_2009I AND THEY DECIDED TO GO NOT ONLY FOR HEALTH AND EDUCATION BUT ALSO STARTING TO GROW THEIR ECONOMY AND THE MARKET REFORMER
HansRosling_2009I THAT THE SIMILARITY WITH INDIA AND CHINA IN MANY WAYS ARE GREATER THAN THE DIFFERENCES WITH THEM AND HERE THEY MARCH ON AND WILL THEY CATCH UP THIS IS THE BIG QUESTION TODAY THERE THEY ARE TODAY
HansRosling_2009I NOW WHAT DOES IT MEAN
HansRosling_2009I BUT ON THE OTHER HAND GUIZHOU ONE OF THE POOREST INLAND PROVINCES OF CHINA IS THERE AND IF I SPLIT GUIZHOU INTO URBAN AND RURAL THE RURAL PART OF GUIZHOU GOES DOWN THERE
HansRosling_2009I YOU SEE THESE ENORMOUS INEQUITY IN CHINA IN THE MIDST OF FAST ECONOMIC GROWTH AND IF I WOULD ALSO LOOK AT INDIA YOU HAVE ANOTHER TYPE OF INEQUITY ACTUALLY IN INDIA THE GEOGRAPHICAL MACROGEOGRAPHICAL DIFFERENCE IS NOT SO BIG
HansRosling_2009I UTTAR PRADESH THE BIGGEST OF THE STATES HERE IS POORER AND HAS A LOWER HEALTH THAN THE REST OF INDIA KERALA IS FLYING ON TOP THERE MATCHING UNITED STATES IN HEALTH BUT NOT IN ECONOMY
HansRosling_2009I AND HERE MAHARASHTRA WITH MUMBAI IS FORGING FORWARD NOW IN INDIA THE BIG INEQUITIES ARE WITHIN THE STATE RATHER THAN BETWEEN THE STATES
HansRosling_2009I IF IT IS IN THE SAME AREA WHERE YOU HAVE A GROWTH CENTER RELATIVELY CLOSE TO WHERE POOR PEOPLE ARE LIVING NO THERE IS ONE MORE INEQUITY LOOK THERE UNITED STATES
HansRosling_2009I OH THEY BROKE MY FRAME WASHINGTON D C
HansRosling_2009I MY FRIENDS AT GAPMINDER WANTED ME TO SHOW THIS BECAUSE THERE IS A NEW LEADER IN WASHINGTON WHO IS REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEALTH SYSTEM AND I CAN UNDERSTAND
HansRosling_2009I SEE A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY FOR KERALA HELPING FIX THE HEALTH SYSTEM IN THE
HansRosling_2009I AND AHEAD OF THEM IS THE WHOLE EMERGING ECONOMIES OF THE WORLD WHICH THOMAS FRIEDMAN SO CORRECTLY CALLED THE FLAT WORLD
HansRosling_2009I YOU CAN SEE THAT IN HEALTH AND EDUCATION A LARGE PART OF THE WORLD POPULATION IS PUTTING FORWARD BUT IN AFRICA AND OTHER PARTS AS IN RURAL GUIZHOU IN CHINA THERE IS STILL PEOPLE WITH LOW HEALTH AND VERY LOW ECONOMY
HansRosling_2009I WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS DISPARITY IN THE WORLD BUT MOST OF THE WORLD IN THE MIDDLE ARE PUSHING FORWARDS VERY FAST NOW BACK TO MY PROJECTIONS WHEN WILL IT CATCH UP I HAVE TO GO BACK TO VERY CONVENTIONAL GRAPH
HansRosling_2009I YOU SEE CHINA UNDER FOREIGN DOMINATION ACTUALLY LOWERED THEIR INCOME AND CAME DOWN TO THE INDIAN LEVEL HERE WHEREAS U K AND UNITED STATES IS GETTING RICHER AND RICHER
HansRosling_2009I THEM TO BE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN NOW THE QUESTION IS WHEN WILL THE CATCH UP TAKE PLACE LOOK AT LOOK AT THE UNITED STATES CAN YOU SEE THE
HansRosling_2009I BUT THE FINANCIAL BUBBLES THAT'S THE DOT COM BUBBLE THIS IS
HansRosling_2009I AND IT SEEMS THIS IS
HansRosling_2009I SO THEY DOESN'T SEEM TO GO THIS WAY THESE COUNTRIES THEY SEEM TO GO IN
HansRosling_2009I MORE HUMBLE GROWTH WAY YOU KNOW AND PEOPLE INTERESTED IN GROWTH ARE TURNING THEIR EYES TOWARDS ASIA I CAN COMPARE TO JAPAN THIS IS JAPAN COMING UP
HansRosling_2009I YOU SEE JAPAN DID IT LIKE THAT WE ADD JAPAN TO IT AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT FAST CATCH UP CAN TAKE PLACE CAN YOU SEE HERE WHAT JAPAN DID
HansRosling_2009I JAPAN DID IT LIKE THIS UNTIL FULL CATCH UP AND THEN THEY FOLLOW WITH THE OTHER HIGH INCOME ECONOMIES BUT THE REAL PROJECTIONS
HansRosling_2009I EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT ABOUT THE PAST I THINK I'M IN A DIFFICULT
HansRosling_2009I POSITION HERE INEQUALITIES IN CHINA AND INDIA I CONSIDER REALLY THE BIG OBSTACLE BECAUSE TO BRING THE ENTIRE POPULATION INTO GROWTH AND PROSPERITY
HansRosling_2009I IS WHAT WILL CREATE A DOMESTIC MARKET WHAT WILL AVOID SOCIAL INSTABILITY AND WHICH WILL MAKE USE OF THE ENTIRE CAPACITY OF THE POPULATION
HansRosling_2009I SO SOCIAL INVESTMENTS IN HEALTH EDUCATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND ELECTRICITY IS REALLY WHAT IS NEEDED IN INDIA AND CHINA
HansRosling_2009I YOU KNOW THE CLIMATE WE HAVE GREAT INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS WITHIN INDIA TELLING US THAT THE CLIMATE IS CHANGING AND ACTIONS HAS TO BE TAKEN OTHERWISE CHINA AND INDIA WOULD BE THE COUNTRIES
HansRosling_2009I MOST TO SUFFER FROM CLIMATE CHANGE AND I CONSIDER INDIA AND CHINA THE BEST PARTNERS IN THE WORLD IN A GOOD GLOBAL CLIMATE POLICY
HansRosling_2009I BUT THEY AIN'T GOING TO PAY FOR WHAT OTHERS WHO HAVE MORE MONEY HAVE LARGELY CREATED AND I CAN AGREE ON THAT BUT WHAT I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IS WAR
HansRosling_2009I AND WILL ASIA BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT NEW POSITION OF BEING IN CHARGE OF BEING THE MOST MIGHTY AND THE GOVERNORS OF THE WORLD SO
HansRosling_2009I AVOID WAR BECAUSE THAT ALWAYS PUSHES HUMAN BEINGS BACKWARD NOW IF THESE INEQUALITIES CLIMATE AND WAR CAN BE AVOIDED GET READY FOR A WORLD
HansRosling_2009I AND IT WILL HAPPEN PRECISELY THE YEAR
HansRosling_2009I TWO THOUSAND AND FORTY EIGHT IN THE LATER PART OF THE SUMMER IN JULY
HansRosling_2009I JULY TWO THOUSAND AND FORTY EIGHT IS MY ONE HUNDREDTH BIRTHDAY
