JustinHallTipping_2011G WE SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS
JustinHallTipping_2011G MARCH THE FIFTEENTH TWO THOUSAND THE B FIFTEEN ICEBERG BROKE OFF THE ROSS ICE SHELF IN THE NEWSPAPER IT SAID
JustinHallTipping_2011G IT WAS ALL PART OF A NORMAL PROCESS A LITTLE BIT FURTHER ON IN THE ARTICLE
JustinHallTipping_2011G IT SAID A LOSS THAT WOULD NORMALLY TAKE THE ICE SHELF
JustinHallTipping_2011G IF WE WALK INTO THE B FIFTEEN ICEBERG WHEN WE LEAVE HERE TODAY WE 'RE GOING TO BUMP INTO SOMETHING A THOUSAND FEET TALL
JustinHallTipping_2011G SEVENTY SIX MILES LONG
JustinHallTipping_2011G SEVENTEEN MILES WIDE
JustinHallTipping_2011G THROUGH THE LENS OF NORMAL
JustinHallTipping_2011G IS ONE OF THE FORCES THAT STOPS US DEVELOPING REAL SOLUTIONS
JustinHallTipping_2011G ONLY NINETY DAYS AFTER THIS ARGUABLY THE GREATEST DISCOVERY OF THE LAST CENTURY OCCURRED
JustinHallTipping_2011G IT WAS THE SEQUENCING FOR THE FIRST TIME OF THE HUMAN GENOME THIS IS THE CODE
JustinHallTipping_2011G THAT 'S IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR FIFTY TRILLION CELLS THAT MAKES US WHO WE ARE
JustinHallTipping_2011G AND WHAT WE ARE AND IF WE JUST TAKE ONE CELL 'S WORTH OF THIS CODE AND UNWIND IT
JustinHallTipping_2011G IT 'S A METER LONG
JustinHallTipping_2011G TWO NANOMETERS THICK TWO NANOMETERS IS TWENTY ATOMS IN THICKNESS AND I WONDERED
JustinHallTipping_2011G WHAT IF THE ANSWER TO SOME OF OUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS COULD BE FOUND IN THE SMALLEST OF PLACES WHERE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT IS VALUABLE AND WHAT IS WORTHLESS IS MERELY THE ADDITION OR SUBTRACTION OF A FEW ATOMS
JustinHallTipping_2011G OVER THE ESSENCE OF ENERGY THE ELECTRON
JustinHallTipping_2011G SO I STARTED TO GO AROUND THE WORLD FINDING THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST SCIENTISTS I COULD AT UNIVERSITIES WHOSE COLLECTIVE DISCOVERIES HAVE THE CHANCE TO TAKE US THERE
JustinHallTipping_2011G AND WE FORMED A COMPANY
JustinHallTipping_2011G TO BUILD ON THEIR EXTRAORDINARY IDEAS SIX AND A HALF YEARS LATER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY RESEARCHERS THEY HAVE SOME AMAZING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LAB
JustinHallTipping_2011G SUCH THAT WE CAN STOP
JustinHallTipping_2011G BURNING UP OUR PLANET AND INSTEAD
JustinHallTipping_2011G WE CAN GENERATE
JustinHallTipping_2011G ALL THE ENERGY WE NEED RIGHT WHERE WE ARE
JustinHallTipping_2011G CLEANLY SAFELY AND CHEAPLY
JustinHallTipping_2011G THINK OF THE SPACE THAT WE SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME
JustinHallTipping_2011G IN WINTER EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE IS HAPPENING WE 'RE TRYING TO HEAT UP THE SPACE THAT WE 'RE IN AND ALL THAT IS TRYING TO GET OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW
JustinHallTipping_2011G ONE OF THE MATERIALS THAT CAN DO THIS IS A REMARKABLE MATERIAL
JustinHallTipping_2011G CARBON THAT HAS CHANGED ITS FORM IN THIS INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL REACTION WHERE GRAPHITE IS BLASTED BY A VAPOR
JustinHallTipping_2011G AND WHEN THE VAPORIZED CARBON CONDENSES IT CONDENSES BACK INTO A DIFFERENT FORM
JustinHallTipping_2011G CHICKENWIRE ROLLED UP
JustinHallTipping_2011G BUT THIS CHICKENWIRE CARBON CALLED A CARBON NANOTUBE IS A HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES SMALLER THAN THE WIDTH OF ONE OF YOUR HAIRS IT 'S A THOUSAND TIMES MORE CONDUCTIVE THAN COPPER
JustinHallTipping_2011G ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT WORKING AT THE NANOSCALE
JustinHallTipping_2011G IS THINGS LOOK AND ACT VERY DIFFERENTLY YOU THINK OF CARBON AS BLACK
JustinHallTipping_2011G CARBON AT THE NANOSCALE
JustinHallTipping_2011G IS ACTUALLY TRANSPARENT
JustinHallTipping_2011G AND WHEN IT 'S IN THIS FORM IF I COMBINE IT WITH A POLYMER
JustinHallTipping_2011G AND AFFIX IT TO YOUR WINDOW
JustinHallTipping_2011G WHEN IT 'S IN ITS
JustinHallTipping_2011G COLORED STATE IT WILL REFLECT AWAY ALL HEAT AND LIGHT AND WHEN IT 'S IN ITS BLEACHED STATE IT WILL LET ALL THE LIGHT AND HEAT THROUGH AND ANY COMBINATION IN BETWEEN
JustinHallTipping_2011G TO CHANGE ITS STATE BY THE WAY TAKES TWO VOLTS FROM A MILLISECOND PULSE
JustinHallTipping_2011G UNTIL YOU CHANGE ITS STATE AGAIN AS WE WERE WORKING ON THIS INCREDIBLE DISCOVERY AT UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA
JustinHallTipping_2011G TO VISIT ANOTHER SCIENTIST
JustinHallTipping_2011G AND HE WAS WORKING ON A PRETTY INCREDIBLE THING
JustinHallTipping_2011G IMAGINE IF WE DIDN 'T HAVE TO RELY ON ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING TO GET AROUND AT NIGHT
JustinHallTipping_2011G IT 'S A NANOMATERIAL TWO NANOMATERIALS
JustinHallTipping_2011G THE TOTAL WIDTH OF IT IS SIX HUNDRED TIMES SMALLER
JustinHallTipping_2011G THAN THE WIDTH OF A DECIMAL PLACE
JustinHallTipping_2011G AND IT TAKES ALL THE INFRARED AVAILABLE AT NIGHT
JustinHallTipping_2011G CONVERTS IT INTO AN ELECTRON
JustinHallTipping_2011G AN IMAGE
JustinHallTipping_2011G WHICH YOU CAN SEE THROUGH
JustinHallTipping_2011G TRANSPARENCY IS KEY
JustinHallTipping_2011G IT 'S A FILM THAT YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH
JustinHallTipping_2011G AND THEN I 'M GOING TO TURN THE LIGHTS OUT
JustinHallTipping_2011G AND YOU CAN SEE OFF A TINY FILM INCREDIBLE CLARITY
JustinHallTipping_2011G AS WE WERE WORKING ON THIS
JustinHallTipping_2011G IT DAWNED ON US
JustinHallTipping_2011G IF WE COMBINED IT
JustinHallTipping_2011G YOU 'VE CONVERTED ENERGY INTO AN ELECTRON
JustinHallTipping_2011G ON A PLASTIC SURFACE THAT YOU CAN STICK ON YOUR WINDOW
JustinHallTipping_2011G BUT BECAUSE IT 'S FLEXIBLE
JustinHallTipping_2011G IT CAN BE ON ANY SURFACE WHATSOEVER
JustinHallTipping_2011G WE TALKED ABOUT GENERATING AND USING
JustinHallTipping_2011G WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT STORING ENERGY AND UNFORTUNATELY
JustinHallTipping_2011G THE BEST THING WE 'VE GOT GOING IS SOMETHING THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN FRANCE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO THE LEAD ACID BATTERY IN TERMS OF DOLLARS PER WHAT 'S STORED IT 'S SIMPLY THE BEST KNOWING THAT WE 'RE NOT GOING TO PUT FIFTY OF THESE IN OUR BASEMENTS TO STORE OUR POWER WE WENT TO A GROUP AT UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT DALLAS AND WE GAVE THEM THIS DIAGRAM
JustinHallTipping_2011G IT WAS IN ACTUALLY A DINER OUTSIDE OF DALLAS FORT WORTH AIRPORT WE SAID COULD YOU BUILD THIS
JustinHallTipping_2011G AND THESE SCIENTISTS INSTEAD OF LAUGHING AT US SAID
JustinHallTipping_2011G HOLD IT UNTIL YOU NEED IT
JustinHallTipping_2011G AND THEN BE ABLE TO RELEASE IT AND PASS IT OFF
JustinHallTipping_2011G BEING ABLE TO DO THAT MEANS
JustinHallTipping_2011G THAT I CAN GENERATE ENERGY CLEANLY EFFICIENTLY AND CHEAPLY RIGHT WHERE I AM
JustinHallTipping_2011G IT 'S MY ENERGY
JustinHallTipping_2011G AND IF I DON 'T NEED IT I CAN CONVERT IT BACK UP ON THE WINDOW TO ENERGY LIGHT
JustinHallTipping_2011G TO YOUR PLACE AND FOR THAT I DO NOT NEED AN ELECTRIC GRID BETWEEN US
JustinHallTipping_2011G THE GRID OF TOMORROW IS NO GRID AND ENERGY CLEAN EFFICIENT ENERGY
JustinHallTipping_2011G WILL ONE DAY BE FREE
JustinHallTipping_2011G IF YOU DO THIS YOU GET THE LAST PUZZLE PIECE WHICH IS WATER
JustinHallTipping_2011G THESE ALSO REQUIRE TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF ENERGY IN FACT IT 'S GOING TO REQUIRE TWICE THE WORLD 'S SUPPLY OF OIL TO RUN THE PUMPS TO GENERATE THE WATER
JustinHallTipping_2011G WE 'RE SIMPLY NOT GOING TO DO THAT
JustinHallTipping_2011G BUT IN A WORLD WHERE ENERGY IS FREED
JustinHallTipping_2011G I 'M GLAD TO BE WORKING WITH INCREDIBLY BRILLIANT AND KIND SCIENTISTS NO KINDER THAN MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
JustinHallTipping_2011G BUT THEY HAVE A MAGIC LOOK AT THE WORLD
JustinHallTipping_2011G AND I 'M GLAD TO SEE THEIR DISCOVERIES COMING OUT OF THE LAB AND INTO THE WORLD
JustinHallTipping_2011G IT 'S BEEN A LONG TIME IN COMING FOR ME EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO
JustinHallTipping_2011G I SAW A PHOTOGRAPH
JustinHallTipping_2011G I 'VE CARRIED THIS PHOTOGRAPH WITH ME EVERY DAY SINCE THEN
JustinHallTipping_2011G IT 'S A PICTURE OF A LITTLE GIRL
JustinHallTipping_2011G DYING OF THIRST
JustinHallTipping_2011G AND WHENEVER I GO ROUND TO SOMEBODY WHO SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE WORKING ON SOMETHING THAT 'S TOO DIFFICULT IT 'LL NEVER HAPPEN
JustinHallTipping_2011G YOU DON 'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY YOU DON 'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME THERE 'S SOMETHING MUCH MORE INTERESTING AROUND THE CORNER
JustinHallTipping_2011G THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS
JustinHallTipping_2011G AND I KNOW THE ANSWER AS TO HOW
JustinHallTipping_2011G IS TO BE ABLE TO GET EXQUISITE CONTROL
JustinHallTipping_2011G OVER A BUILDING BLOCK OF NATURE
