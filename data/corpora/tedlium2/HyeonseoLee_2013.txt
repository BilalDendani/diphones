HyeonseoLee_2013 AND I WAS VERY
HyeonseoLee_2013 MY FAMILY WAS NOT POOR AND MYSELF I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED HUNGER
HyeonseoLee_2013 BECAUSE WE HAVEN 'T EATEN FOR THE PAST
HyeonseoLee_2013 A LIFELESS WOMAN WAS LYING ON THE GROUND
HyeonseoLee_2013 BECAUSE THEY WERE SO FOCUSED ON TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES
HyeonseoLee_2013 AS YOU CAN SEE THE RIVER CAN BE VERY NARROW AT CERTAIN POINTS
HyeonseoLee_2013 ALLOWING NORTH KOREANS TO SECRETLY CROSS
HyeonseoLee_2013 THAT I WOULD BE SEPARATED FROM MY FAMILY FOR A SHORT TIME
HyeonseoLee_2013 I COULD HAVE NEVER IMAGINED THAT IT WOULD TAKE FOURTEEN YEARS TO LIVE TOGETHER
HyeonseoLee_2013 AS ILLEGAL MIGRANTS
HyeonseoLee_2013 SO I WAS LIVING IN CONSTANT FEAR THAT MY IDENTITY COULD BE REVEALED AND I WOULD BE REPATRIATED TO A HORRIBLE FATE BACK IN NORTH KOREA
HyeonseoLee_2013 I WAS SO SCARED
HyeonseoLee_2013 I THOUGHT MY LIFE WAS OVER
HyeonseoLee_2013 BUT MANY CAN BE CAUGHT
HyeonseoLee_2013 EVEN THOUGH I WAS REALLY FORTUNATE TO GET OUT MANY OTHER NORTH KOREANS HAVE NOT BEEN SO LUCKY IT 'S TRAGIC THAT NORTH KOREANS HAVE TO HIDE THEIR IDENTITIES AND STRUGGLE SO HARD JUST TO SURVIVE
HyeonseoLee_2013 JUST AS I WAS STARTING TO GET USED TO MY NEW LIFE
HyeonseoLee_2013 I RECEIVED A SHOCKING PHONE CALL THE NORTH KOREAN AUTHORITIES INTERCEPTED SOME MONEY THAT I SENT TO MY FAMILY AND AS A PUNISHMENT MY FAMILY WAS GOING TO BE FORCIBLY REMOVED TO A DESOLATE LOCATION IN THE COUNTRYSIDE THEY HAD TO GET OUT QUICKLY
HyeonseoLee_2013 SO I STARTED PLANNING HOW TO HELP THEM ESCAPE
HyeonseoLee_2013 AND BOARDED BY A CHINESE POLICE OFFICER
HyeonseoLee_2013 HE TOOK EVERYONE 'S I D CARDS AND HE STARTED ASKING THEM QUESTIONS SINCE MY FAMILY COULDN 'T UNDERSTAND CHINESE
HyeonseoLee_2013 I DID EVERYTHING
HyeonseoLee_2013 TO GET MY FAMILY
HyeonseoLee_2013 THE KIND STRANGER SYMBOLIZED NEW HOPE FOR ME AND THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE WHEN WE NEEDED IT MOST AND HE SHOWED ME THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS AND THE SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ARE TRULY THE RAYS OF HOPE WE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE NEED
HyeonseoLee_2013 I 'VE BEEN SO LUCKY RECEIVED SO MUCH HELP AND INSPIRATION IN MY LIFE SO I WANT TO HELP GIVE ASPIRING NORTH KOREANS A CHANCE TO PROSPER
