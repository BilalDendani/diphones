ThomasBarnett_2005 WHAT I'VE SPENT FIFTEEN YEARS DOING IN THIS BUSINESS AND IT'S TAKEN ME ALMOST FOURTEEN TO FIGURE IT OUT IS I THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF WARS IN THE CONTEXT OF EVERYTHING ELSE
ThomasBarnett_2005 SO I TEND TO SPECIALIZE ON THE SCENE BETWEEN WAR AND PEACE THE MATERIAL I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IS ONE IDEA FOR A BOOK WELL A LOT OF IDEAS IT'S THE ONE TAKES ME ROUND THE WORLD RIGHT NOW INTERACTING WITH FOREIGN MILITARIES QUITE
ThomasBarnett_2005 GENERATED IN TWO YEARS OF WORK I DID FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE THINKING ABOUT A NEW NATIONAL GRAND STRATEGY FOR THE UNITED STATES I'M GOING TO PRESENT A PROBLEM AND TRY TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER
ThomasBarnett_2005 MY FAVORITE BONEHEAD CONCEPT FROM THE NINETEEN NINETIES IN THE PENTAGON THE THEORY OF ANTI ACCESS AREA DENIAL ASYMMETRICAL STRATEGIES WHY DO WE CALL IT THAT BECAUSE IT'S GOT ALL THOSE
ThomasBarnett_2005 FROM EVEN MEETING AN AIR FORCE WILLING TO FLY AGAINST OURS SO THAT OVERMATCHED CAPABILITY CREATES PROBLEMS CATASTROPHIC SUCCESSES THE WHITE HOUSE CALLS THEM
ThomasBarnett_2005 OK THE THEORY OF ANTI ACCESS AREA DENIAL ASYMMETRICAL STRATEGIES GOBBLEDYGOOK THAT WE SELL TO CONGRESS BECAUSE IF WE JUST TOLD THEM WE CAN KICK ANYBODY 'S ASSES
ThomasBarnett_2005 THEY WOULDN'T BUY US ALL THE STUFF WE WANT SO WE SAY AREA DENIAL ANTI ACCESS ASYMMETRICAL STRATEGIES AND THEIR EYES GLAZE OVER
ThomasBarnett_2005 AND THEY SAY WILL YOU BUILD IT IN MY DISTRICT
ThomasBarnett_2005 A BANANA PEEL ON THE TARMAC
ThomasBarnett_2005 WE SAY CHINA IT'S YOURS PROMETHEUS APPROACH LARGELY A GEOGRAPHIC DEFINITION FOCUS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON THE START OF CONFLICT WE FIELD THE FIRST HALF TEAM IN A LEAGUE THAT INSISTS ON KEEPING SCORE UNTIL THE END OF THE GAME THAT'S THE PROBLEM WE CAN RUN THE SCORE UP AGAINST ANYBODY
ThomasBarnett_2005 THEY CALL FOURTH GENERATION WARFARE
ThomasBarnett_2005 IT INSTEAD THERE IS NO BATTLE SPACE THE U S MILITARY CANNOT ACCESS THEY SAID WE COULDN'T DO AFGHANISTAN WE DID IT WITH EASE THEY SAID WE COULDN'T DO
ThomasBarnett_2005 THERE IS NOBODY WE CAN'T TAKE DOWN THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE POWER
ThomasBarnett_2005 SO THERE'S NO TROUBLE ACCESSING BATTLE SPACES WHAT WE HAVE TROUBLE ACCESSING IS THE TRANSITION SPACE THAT MUST NATURALLY FOLLOW AND CREATING THE PEACE SPACE THAT ALLOWS US TO MOVE ON
ThomasBarnett_2005 POOR COUNTRY RUNS OFF THAT LEDGE DOES THAT CARTOON THING AND THEN DROPS
ThomasBarnett_2005 THEY SAID TO US YOU KNOW WHAT IN THAT TRANSITION SPACE YOU'RE MOSTLY HAT NOT ENOUGH CATTLE
ThomasBarnett_2005 WE DON'T THINK YOU CAN PULL IT OFF WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU OUR SEVENTEEN THOUSAND PEACE KEEPERS FOR FODDER WE ASKED
ThomasBarnett_2005 THE RUSSIANS FOR FORTY THOUSAND THEY SAID NO I WAS IN CHINA IN AUGUST I SAID YOU SHOULD HAVE FIFTY THOUSAND PEACE KEEPERS IN IRAQ IT'S YOUR OIL NOT OURS
ThomasBarnett_2005 WHICH IS THE TRUTH IT'S THEIR OIL
ThomasBarnett_2005 WE HAVE TROUBLE ACCESSING OUR OUTCOMES
ThomasBarnett_2005 WE LUCKED OUT FRANKLY ON THE SELECTION WE FACE DIFFERENT OPPONENTS ACROSS THESE THREE AND IT'S TIME TO START ADMITTING YOU CAN'T ASK THE SAME NINETEEN YEAR OLD TO DO IT ALL
ThomasBarnett_2005 DAY IN AND DAY OUT IT'S JUST
ThomasBarnett_2005 WE HAVE AN UNPARALLELED CAPACITY TO WAGE WAR
ThomasBarnett_2005 WE DON'T DO THE EVERYTHING ELSE SO WELL FRANKLY WE DO IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY AND WE STILL SUCK AT IT WE HAVE A BRILLIANT SECRETARY OF WAR WE DON'T HAVE
ThomasBarnett_2005 I THINK WE HAVE AN UNPARALLELED CAPACITY TO WAGE WAR I CALL THAT THE LEVIATHAN FORCE WHAT WE NEED TO BUILD IS A FORCE FOR THE EVERYTHING ELSE I CALL THEM SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS
ThomasBarnett_2005 WE ARGUE ABOUT IT EVERY TIME WE USE IT ARGENTINA JUST WENT THROUGH IT BROKE A LOT OF RULES THEY GOT OUT ON THE FAR END WE
ThomasBarnett_2005 IT'S TRANSPARENT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CERTAINTY GIVES THE SENSE OF A NON ZERO OUTCOME WE DON'T HAVE ONE FOR PROCESSING POLITICALLY BANKRUPT STATES THAT FRANKLY EVERYBODY WANTS GONE LIKE SADDAM LIKE MUGABE LIKE KIM JONG IL
ThomasBarnett_2005 WE HAVE EXTANT RIGHT NOW AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS SYSTEM IS THE U N SECURITY COUNCIL AS A GRAND JURY WHAT CAN THEY DO THEY CAN INDICT YOUR ASS
ThomasBarnett_2005 THEY CAN DEBATE IT THEY CAN WRITE IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER THEY CAN PUT IT IN AN ENVELOPE AND MAIL IT TO YOU AND THEN SAY IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS
ThomasBarnett_2005 PLEASE CUT THAT OUT
ThomasBarnett_2005 WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO TRANSLATE
ThomasBarnett_2005 HERE 'S THE DEAL AS SOON AS I CAN'T FIND ANYBODY ELSE TO AIR OUT I LEAVE THE SCENE IMMEDIATELY THAT'S CALLED THE POWELL DOCTRINE
ThomasBarnett_2005 WAY DOWNSTREAM WE HAVE THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT THEY LOVE TO PUT THEM ON TRIAL THEY'VE GOT MILOSEVIC RIGHT NOW
ThomasBarnett_2005 BUT WE USE THIS LANGUAGE FROM A BYGONE ERA
ThomasBarnett_2005 JESUS IT WAS DARK
ThomasBarnett_2005 YOU WANT TO DO IT FRANCE FRANCE SAYS
ThomasBarnett_2005 WHAT WE NEED DOWNSTREAM IS A GREAT POWER
ThomasBarnett_2005 YOU GET THEN NO LOOTING NO MILITARY DISAPPEARING NO ARMS DISAPPEARING NO AMMO DISAPPEARING NO MUQTADA AL SADR I'M WRECKING HIS BONES NO INSURGENCY
ThomasBarnett_2005 AND WE DICKED AROUND FOR SIX MONTHS AND THEN THEY TURNED ON US WHY BECAUSE THEY JUST GOT FED UP
ThomasBarnett_2005 THEY SAW WHAT WE DID TO SADDAM THEY SAID YOU 'RE THAT POWERFUL YOU CAN RESURRECT THIS COUNTRY YOU'RE AMERICA
ThomasBarnett_2005 WHAT WE NEED IS AN INTERNATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION FUND SEBASTIAN MALLABY WASHINGTON POST GREAT IDEA MODEL ON THE
ThomasBarnett_2005 THEY'RE GOING TO DECIDE UP FRONT HOW THE MONEY GETS SPENT JUST LIKE IN THE IMF YOU VOTE ACCORDING TO HOW MUCH MONEY YOU PUT IN THE KITTY
ThomasBarnett_2005 I'M TALKING ABOUT REGULARIZING IT MAKING IT TRANSPARENT WOULD YOU LIKE MUGABE GONE WOULD YOU LIKE KIM JONG IL WHO 'S KILLED ABOUT TWO MILLION PEOPLE WOULD YOU LIKE HIM GONE
ThomasBarnett_2005 LIKE A BETTER SYSTEM THIS IS WHY IT MATTERS TO THE MILITARY THEY'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING
ThomasBarnett_2005 WE DO DESERT STORM THE SPLIT STARTS TO EMERGE BETWEEN THOSE IN THE MILITARY WHO SEE A FUTURE THEY CAN LIVE WITH AND THOSE WHO SEE A FUTURE THAT STARTS TO SCARE THEM LIKE THE U S SUBMARINE COMMUNITY WHICH WATCHES THE SOVIET NAVY DISAPPEAR OVERNIGHT
ThomasBarnett_2005 THE MILITARY GOT DRAGGED OUT INTO THE MUCK ACROSS THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND THEY DEVELOPED THIS VERY DERISIVE TERM TO DESCRIBE IT MILITARY OPERATIONS OTHER THAN WAR I ASK YOU WHO JOINS THE MILITARY TO DO THINGS OTHER THAN WAR
ThomasBarnett_2005 I MAINTAIN THIS IS CODE INSIDE THE ARMY FOR WE DON'T WANT TO DO THIS
ThomasBarnett_2005 THEY SPENT THE NINETEEN NINETIES WORKING THE MESSY SCENE BETWEEN GLOBALIZED PARTS OF THE WORLD WHAT I CALL THE CORE AND THE
ThomasBarnett_2005 SO WE WERE HOME ALONE FOR EIGHT YEARS AND WHAT DID WE DO HOME ALONE WE BOUGHT ONE MILITARY AND WE OPERATED ANOTHER AND IT'S LIKE THE GUY WHO GOES TO THE DOCTOR AND SAYS DOCTOR IT HURTS
ThomasBarnett_2005 DOCTOR SAYS STOP DOING THAT YOU
ThomasBarnett_2005 THIS BRIEF INSIDE THE PENTAGON IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES I'D SAY YOU 'RE BUYING ONE MILITARY AND YOU'RE OPERATING ANOTHER AND EVENTUALLY IT'S GOING TO HURT IT'S WRONG BAD PENTAGON
ThomasBarnett_2005 RAISE AN ARMY WHEN YOU NEED IT AND MAINTAIN A NAVY FOR DAY TO DAY CONNECTIVITY
ThomasBarnett_2005 OF WAR A DEPARTMENT OF EVERYTHING ELSE A BIG STICK
ThomasBarnett_2005 A BATON STICK
ThomasBarnett_2005 CAN OF WHUP ASS
ThomasBarnett_2005 TO ATTACK AMERICA IS TO RISK BLOWING UP THE WORLD WE CONNECTED NATIONAL SECURITY TO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY
ThomasBarnett_2005 THAT'S THE SCARY PART THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE RECONNECT AMERICAN NATIONAL SECURITY WITH GLOBAL SECURITY
ThomasBarnett_2005 SINCE IS THAT BIFURCATION I DESCRIBED
ThomasBarnett_2005 WE TALKED ABOUT THIS GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE END OF THE COLD WAR LET 'S HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF WAR AND A DEPARTMENT OF SOMETHING ELSE

ThomasBarnett_2005 THE WAR IN IRAQ HE WAS A BAD GUY WITH MULTIPLE PRIORS
ThomasBarnett_2005 I KNEW WE'D KICK ASS IN THE WAR WITH THE LEVIATHAN FORCE I KNEW WE'D HAVE A HARD TIME WITH WHAT FOLLOWED BUT I KNOW THIS ORGANIZATION DOESN'T CHANGE UNTIL IT EXPERIENCES FAILURE
ThomasBarnett_2005 THIS IS THE HOBBESIAN FORCE
ThomasBarnett_2005 WHY I TRAVEL ALL OVER THE WORLD TALKING TO FOREIGN MILITARIES WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IT MEANS YOU'VE GOT TO STOP PRETENDING YOU CAN DO
ThomasBarnett_2005 THESE TWO VERY DISPARATE SKILL SETS WITH THE SAME NINETEEN YEAR OLD SWITCHING BACK MORNING AFTERNOON EVENING MORNING AFTERNOON EVENING HANDING OUT
ThomasBarnett_2005 THAT FORCE ON THE LEFT YOU CAN TRAIN A NINETEEN YEAR OLD TO DO THAT THAT FORCE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE LIKE A FORTY YEAR OLD COP

ThomasBarnett_2005 UP OR OUT THE FORCE ON THE RIGHT IN AND OUT

ThomasBarnett_2005 THE NATIONAL GUARD 'S GOING TO BE THE FORCE ON THE LEFT IS NEVER COMING UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT
ThomasBarnett_2005 ADMIN FORCE HAS TO
ThomasBarnett_2005 ONE TAKES DOWN NETWORKS ONE PUTS THEM UP
ThomasBarnett_2005 WAGE WAR HERE IN SUCH A WAY TO FACILITATE THAT DO WE NEED A BIGGER BUDGET DO WE NEED A DRAFT TO PULL THIS OFF ABSOLUTELY NOT

ThomasBarnett_2005 NAVY STRATEGIC SUBS GO THIS WAY SURFACE COMBATANTS ARE OVER THERE AND THE NEWS IS THEY MAY ACTUALLY BE THAT SMALL
ThomasBarnett_2005 I CALL IT THE SMART DUST NAVY I TELL YOUNG OFFICERS YOU MAY COMMAND FIVE HUNDRED SHIPS IN YOUR CAREER
ThomasBarnett_2005 BAD NEWS IS THEY MAY NOT HAVE ANYBODY ON THEM CARRIERS GO BOTH WAYS BECAUSE THEY'RE A SWING ASSET
ThomasBarnett_2005 ARMOR GOES THIS WAY HERE 'S THE DIRTY SECRET OF THE AIR FORCE YOU CAN WIN BY BOMBING
ThomasBarnett_2005 BUT YOU NEED LOTS OF THESE GUYS ON THE GROUND TO WIN THE PEACE SHINSEKI WAS RIGHT WITH THE ARGUMENT
