JoanHalifax_2010W@19.18:32.34 COMPASSION HAS MANY FACES SOME OF THEM ARE FIERCE SOME OF THEM ARE WRATHFUL SOME OF THEM ARE TENDER SOME OF THEM ARE WISE A LINE THAT THE DALAI LAMA ONCE SAID HE SAID LOVE AND COMPASSION
JoanHalifax_2010W@36.98:40.16 WITHOUT THEM HUMANITY CANNOT SURVIVE
JoanHalifax_2010W@41.02:49.57 AND I WOULD SUGGEST IT IS NOT ONLY HUMANITY THAT WON 'T SURVIVE BUT IT IS ALL SPECIES ON THE PLANET AS WE 'VE HEARD TODAY
JoanHalifax_2010W@49.8:52.93 IT IS THE BIG CATS AND IT 'S THE PLANKTON
JoanHalifax_2010W@55.19:61.01 TWO WEEKS AGO I WAS IN BANGALORE IN INDIA I WAS SO PRIVILEGED TO BE ABLE TO TEACH IN
JoanHalifax_2010W@69.1:74.04 IN THAT HOSPICE THERE WERE THIRTY ONE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE ACTIVELY DYING
JoanHalifax_2010W@75.42:85.35 AND I WALKED UP TO THE BEDSIDE OF AN OLD WOMAN WHO WAS BREATHING VERY RAPIDLY FRAGILE OBVIOUSLY IN THE LATTER PHASE OF ACTIVE DYING
JoanHalifax_2010W@85.81:87.82 I LOOKED INTO
JoanHalifax_2010W@101:105.35 A LINE FROM THE MAHABHARATA THE GREAT INDIAN EPIC
JoanHalifax_2010W@112.48:126.26 AND YUDHISTHIRA REPLIED THE MOST WONDROUS THING IN THE WORLD IS THAT ALL AROUND US PEOPLE CAN BE DYING AND WE DON 'T REALIZE IT CAN HAPPEN TO US
JoanHalifax_2010W@145.36:160.82 I LOOKED INTO THE FACE OF ONE OF THESE WOMEN AND I SAW IN HER FACE THE STRENGTH THAT ARISES WHEN NATURAL COMPASSION IS REALLY PRESENT I WATCHED HER HANDS AS SHE BATHED AN OLD MAN
JoanHalifax_2010W@161.62:164.96 MY GAZE WENT TO ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN
JoanHalifax_2010W@165.75:168.18 AS SHE WIPED THE FACE
JoanHalifax_2010W@168.94:182.44 OF ANOTHER DYING PERSON AND IT REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING THAT I HAD JUST BEEN PRESENT FOR EVERY YEAR OR SO I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF TAKING CLINICIANS INTO THE HIMALAYAS AND THE TIBETAN PLATEAU
JoanHalifax_2010W@208.35:212.3 AND WE LOOKED INTO THE RAGS AND THERE WAS THIS PAIR OF EYES
JoanHalifax_2010W@213.17:215.14 THE RAGS WERE UNWRAPPED
JoanHalifax_2010W@215.43:219.03 FROM A LITTLE GIRL WHOSE BODY WAS MASSIVELY BURNED
JoanHalifax_2010W@231.21:235.67 WHO CLEANED THE WOUNDS OF THIS BABY AND DRESSED THE WOUNDS
JoanHalifax_2010W@236.14:238.09 I KNOW THOSE HANDS AND EYES
JoanHalifax_2010W@238.37:244.65 THEY TOUCHED ME AS WELL THEY TOUCHED ME AT THAT TIME THEY HAVE TOUCHED ME THROUGHOUT MY SIXTY EIGHT YEARS
JoanHalifax_2010W@245.31:256.79 THEY TOUCHED ME WHEN I WAS FOUR AND I LOST MY EYESIGHT AND WAS PARTIALLY PARALYZED AND MY FAMILY BROUGHT IN A WOMAN WHOSE MOTHER HAD BEEN A SLAVE TO TAKE CARE OF ME
JoanHalifax_2010W@262.32:272.83 SHE HAD PHENOMENAL STRENGTH AND IT WAS REALLY HER STRENGTH I BELIEVE THAT BECAME THE KIND OF MUDRA AND IMPRIMATUR THAT HAS BEEN A GUIDING LIGHT IN MY LIFE
JoanHalifax_2010W@280.97:287.07 AND THERE ARE VARIOUS FACETS AND THERE 'S REFERENTIAL AND NON REFERENTIAL COMPASSION
JoanHalifax_2010W@294.06:310.07 IT IS THAT ABILITY TO REALLY STAND STRONG AND TO RECOGNIZE ALSO THAT I 'M NOT SEPARATE FROM THIS SUFFERING BUT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE COMPASSION WHICH ACTIVATES THE MOTOR CORTEX MEANS THAT WE ASPIRE
JoanHalifax_2010W@310.65:319.4 WE ACTUALLY ASPIRE TO TRANSFORM SUFFERING AND IF WE 'RE SO BLESSED WE ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES THAT TRANSFORM SUFFERING
JoanHalifax_2010W@325.48:329.06 THAT COMPONENT IS THAT WE CANNOT BE ATTACHED TO OUTCOME
JoanHalifax_2010W@330.22:334.59 NOW I WORKED WITH DYING PEOPLE FOR OVER FORTY YEARS
JoanHalifax_2010W@335.69:337.95 I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING
JoanHalifax_2010W@338.14:350.25 ON DEATH ROW IN A MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON FOR SIX YEARS AND I REALIZED SO CLEARLY IN BRINGING MY OWN LIFE EXPERIENCE FROM WORKING WITH DYING PEOPLE AND TRAINING CAREGIVERS
JoanHalifax_2010W@350.36:353.23 THAT ANY ATTACHMENT TO OUTCOME
JoanHalifax_2010W@353.37:359.95 WOULD DISTORT DEEPLY MY OWN CAPACITY TO BE FULLY PRESENT TO THE WHOLE CATASTROPHE
JoanHalifax_2010W@360.67:365.29 AND WHEN I WORKED IN THE PRISON SYSTEM IT WAS SO CLEAR TO ME THIS
JoanHalifax_2010W@391.63:411.59 ARE PARTICULAR CONDITIONS I HAD THAT CONDITION TO A CERTAIN EXTENT FROM MY OWN CHILDHOOD ILLNESS EVE ENSLER WHOM YOU 'LL HEAR LATER HAS HAD THAT CONDITION ACTIVATED AMAZINGLY IN HER THROUGH THE VARIOUS WATERS OF SUFFERING THAT SHE HAS BEEN THROUGH
JoanHalifax_2010W@417.63:420.84 AND THOSE ENEMIES ARE THINGS LIKE PITY
JoanHalifax_2010W@423.33:424.86 MORAL OUTRAGE
JoanHalifax_2010W@439.04:441.52 THE VERY WORD TERROR
JoanHalifax_2010W@454.88:457.59 OF OUR ENTIRE GLOBE
JoanHalifax_2010W@458.71:466.87 NOW WE KNOW FROM NEUROSCIENCE THAT COMPASSION HAS SOME VERY EXTRAORDINARY QUALITIES FOR EXAMPLE
JoanHalifax_2010W@467.31:473.76 A PERSON WHO IS CULTIVATING COMPASSION WHEN THEY ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF SUFFERING
JoanHalifax_2010W@474.13:478.21 THEY FEEL THAT SUFFERING A LOT MORE THAN MANY OTHER PEOPLE DO
JoanHalifax_2010W@483.86:485.37 THIS IS CALLED RESILIENCE
JoanHalifax_2010W@494.15:501.92 ANOTHER THING ABOUT COMPASSION IS THAT IT REALLY ENHANCES WHAT 'S CALLED NEURAL INTEGRATION IT HOOKS UP ALL PARTS OF THE BRAIN
JoanHalifax_2010W@503:513.39 ANOTHER WHICH HAS BEEN DISCOVERED BY VARIOUS RESEARCHERS AT EMORY AND AT DAVIS AND SO ON IS THAT COMPASSION ENHANCES OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM
JoanHalifax_2010W@523:533.52 IN THE FACE OF PSYCHO SOCIAL AND PHYSICAL POISONS OF THE TOXINS OF OUR WORLD BUT COMPASSION THE GENERATION OF COMPASSION ACTUALLY MOBILIZES
JoanHalifax_2010W@543.4:547.15 WHY DON 'T WE TRAIN OUR CHILDREN IN COMPASSION
JoanHalifax_2010W@575.21:577.14 PEOPLE IN OUR
JoanHalifax_2010W@605.8:613.35 AND THE ARCHETYPE OF THIS IN BUDDHISM IS AVALOKITESHVARA KUAN YIN IT 'S A FEMALE ARCHETYPE
JoanHalifax_2010W@614.38:619.66 SHE WHO PERCEIVES THE CRIES OF SUFFERING IN THE
JoanHalifax_2010W@639.45:642.96 I SAY THAT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS WOMEN HAVE
JoanHalifax_2010W@646.18:648.81 MET IN INTIMACY THE ARCHETYPE
JoanHalifax_2010W@652.3:657.55 SHE WHO PERCEIVES THE CRIES OF SUFFERING IN THE WORLD
JoanHalifax_2010W@658.04:671.27 WOMEN HAVE MANIFESTED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS THE STRENGTH ARISING FROM COMPASSION IN AN UNFILTERED UNMEDIATED WAY IN PERCEIVING SUFFERING AS IT IS
JoanHalifax_2010W@673.71:684.36 THEY HAVE INFUSED SOCIETIES WITH KINDNESS AND WE HAVE REALLY FELT THAT AS WOMAN AFTER WOMAN HAS STOOD ON THIS STAGE IN THE PAST DAY AND A HALF
JoanHalifax_2010W@685.72:689.42 AND THEY HAVE ACTUALIZED COMPASSION THROUGH DIRECT ACTION
JoanHalifax_2010W@690.25:701.71 JODY WILLIAMS CALLED IT IT 'S GOOD TO MEDITATE I 'M SORRY YOU 'VE GOT TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF THAT JODY STEP BACK GIVE YOUR MOTHER A BREAK OKAY
JoanHalifax_2010W@719.48:721.78 HE SEES SOMETHING IN THE PATH
JoanHalifax_2010W@721.97:729.05 HE LOOKS IT 'S A DOG HE DROPS TO HIS KNEES HE SEES THAT THE DOG HAS THIS BIG WOUND ON ITS LEG
JoanHalifax_2010W@729.25:731.56 THE WOUND IS JUST FILLED WITH MAGGOTS
JoanHalifax_2010W@737.1:738.8 SO AS NOT TO HARM THEM
JoanHalifax_2010W@748.17:751.62 I BELIEVE THAT WOMEN AND GIRLS TODAY
JoanHalifax_2010W@751.96:755 HAVE TO PARTNER IN A POWERFUL WAY WITH MEN
JoanHalifax_2010W@755.78:757.5 WITH THEIR FATHERS
JoanHalifax_2010W@770.05:774.06 THE WOMEN IN THIS ROOM ARE LOTUSES IN A SEA OF FIRE
JoanHalifax_2010W@774.96:780.45 MAY WE ACTUALIZE THAT CAPACITY FOR WOMEN EVERYWHERE THANK YOU
