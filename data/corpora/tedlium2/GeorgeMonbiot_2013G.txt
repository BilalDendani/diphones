GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@21.78:39.97 I WAS AS RECKLESS AND FOOLISH AS ONLY YOUNG MEN CAN BE THIS IS WHY WARS GET FOUGHT BUT I ALSO FELT MORE ALIVE THAN I 'VE EVER DONE SINCE AND WHEN I CAME HOME I FOUND THE SCOPE OF MY EXISTENCE GRADUALLY DIMINISHING UNTIL LOADING THE DISHWASHER SEEMED LIKE AN INTERESTING CHALLENGE
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@39.97:53.57 AND I FOUND MYSELF SORT OF SCRATCHING AT THE WALLS OF LIFE AS IF I WAS TRYING TO FIND A WAY OUT INTO A WIDER SPACE BEYOND I WAS I BELIEVE ECOLOGICALLY BORED
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@53.57:61.5 NOW WE EVOLVED IN RATHER MORE CHALLENGING TIMES THAN THESE IN A WORLD OF HORNS AND TUSKS AND
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@61.5:79.22 FANGS AND CLAWS AND WE STILL POSSESS THE FEAR AND THE COURAGE AND THE AGGRESSION REQUIRED TO NAVIGATE THOSE TIMES BUT IN OUR COMFORTABLE SAFE CROWDED LANDS WE HAVE FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO EXERCISE THEM WITHOUT HARMING OTHER PEOPLE
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@79.22:84.18 AND THIS WAS THE SORT OF CONSTRAINT THAT I FOUND MYSELF
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@84.18:100.05 BUMPING UP AGAINST TO CONQUER UNCERTAINTY TO KNOW WHAT COMES NEXT THAT 'S ALMOST BEEN THE DOMINANT AIM OF INDUSTRIALIZED SOCIETIES AND HAVING GOT THERE OR ALMOST GOT THERE
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@100.05:112.84 WE HAVE JUST ENCOUNTERED A NEW SET OF UNMET NEEDS WE 'VE PRIVILEGED SAFETY OVER EXPERIENCE AND WE 'VE GAINED A LOT IN DOING SO BUT I THINK WE 'VE LOST SOMETHING TOO
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@166.08:181.43 AND EVEN THOUGH REWILDING IS A YOUNG WORD IT ALREADY HAS SEVERAL DEFINITIONS BUT THERE ARE TWO IN PARTICULAR THAT FASCINATE ME THE FIRST ONE IS THE MASS RESTORATION OF ECOSYSTEMS
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@181.43:200.32 ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS OF THE PAST HALF CENTURY HAS BEEN THE DISCOVERY OF WIDESPREAD TROPHIC CASCADES A TROPHIC CASCADE IS AN ECOLOGICAL PROCESS WHICH STARTS AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN AND TUMBLES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@216.31:220.01 THAT THEY GIVE LIFE TO MANY OTHERS
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@223.03:241.78 BEFORE THE WOLVES TURNED UP THEY 'D BEEN ABSENT FOR SEVENTY YEARS THE NUMBERS OF DEER BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING TO HUNT THEM HAD BUILT UP AND BUILT UP IN THE YELLOWSTONE PARK AND DESPITE EFFORTS BY HUMANS TO CONTROL THEM THEY 'D MANAGED TO REDUCE MUCH OF THE VEGETATION THERE TO ALMOST NOTHING THEY 'D JUST GRAZED IT AWAY
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@241.78:249.68 BUT AS SOON AS THE WOLVES ARRIVED EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE FEW IN NUMBER THEY STARTED TO HAVE THE MOST REMARKABLE EFFECTS
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@249.68:253.51 FIRST OF COURSE THEY KILLED SOME OF THE DEER BUT THAT WASN 'T THE MAJOR THING
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@253.51:266.58 MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANTLY THEY RADICALLY CHANGED THE BEHAVIOR OF THE DEER THE DEER STARTED AVOIDING CERTAIN PARTS OF THE PARK THE PLACES WHERE THEY COULD BE TRAPPED MOST EASILY PARTICULARLY THE VALLEYS AND THE GORGES
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@266.58:275.32 AND IMMEDIATELY THOSE PLACES STARTED TO REGENERATE IN SOME AREAS THE HEIGHT OF THE TREES QUINTUPLED IN JUST SIX YEARS
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@275.32:281.47 BARE VALLEY SIDES QUICKLY BECAME FORESTS OF ASPEN AND WILLOW AND COTTONWOOD
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@281.47:285.56 AND AS SOON AS THAT HAPPENED THE BIRDS STARTED MOVING
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@310.14:312.97 THE WOLVES KILLED COYOTES AND
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@313:326.68 AS A RESULT OF THAT THE NUMBER OF RABBITS AND MICE BEGAN TO RISE WHICH MEANT MORE HAWKS MORE WEASELS MORE FOXES MORE BADGERS RAVENS AND BALD EAGLES CAME DOWN TO FEED ON THE CARRION THAT THE WOLVES HAD LEFT
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@326.68:341.81 BEARS FED ON IT TOO AND THEIR POPULATION BEGAN TO RISE AS WELL PARTLY ALSO BECAUSE THERE WERE MORE BERRIES GROWING ON THE REGENERATING SHRUBS AND THE BEARS REINFORCED THE IMPACT OF THE WOLVES BY KILLING SOME OF THE CALVES OF THE DEER
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@341.81:352.01 BUT HERE 'S WHERE IT GETS REALLY INTERESTING THE WOLVES CHANGED THE BEHAVIOR OF THE RIVERS
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@352.01:364.03 THEY BEGAN TO MEANDER LESS THERE WAS LESS EROSION THE CHANNELS NARROWED MORE POOLS FORMED MORE RIFFLE SECTIONS ALL OF WHICH WERE GREAT FOR WILDLIFE HABITATS THE RIVERS CHANGED
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@364.03:376.64 IN RESPONSE TO THE WOLVES AND THE REASON WAS THAT THE REGENERATING FORESTS STABILIZED THE BANKS SO THAT THEY COLLAPSED LESS OFTEN SO THAT THE RIVERS BECAME MORE FIXED IN THEIR COURSE
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@376.64:392.94 SIMILARLY BY DRIVING THE DEER OUT OF SOME PLACES AND THE VEGETATION RECOVERING ON THE VALLEY SIDES THERE WAS LESS SOIL EROSION BECAUSE THE VEGETATION STABILIZED THAT AS WELL SO THE WOLVES SMALL IN NUMBER
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@398.98:403.11 BUT ALSO ITS PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@403.11:418.74 WHALES IN THE SOUTHERN OCEANS HAVE SIMILARLY WIDE RANGING EFFECTS ONE OF THE MANY POST RATIONAL EXCUSES MADE BY THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT FOR KILLING WHALES IS THAT THEY SAID WELL THE NUMBER OF FISH AND KRILL WILL RISE AND THEN THERE 'LL BE MORE FOR PEOPLE TO EAT
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@427.64:433.65 BUT THE OPPOSITE HAPPENED YOU TAKE THE WHALES AWAY AND THE NUMBER OF KRILL
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@453.36:458 HUGE EXPLOSIONS OF POOP RIGHT ACROSS THE SURFACE WATERS
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@458:475.64 UP IN THE PHOTIC ZONE WHERE THERE 'S ENOUGH LIGHT TO ALLOW PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO TAKE PLACE AND THOSE GREAT PLUMES OF FERTILIZER STIMULATE THE GROWTH OF PHYTOPLANKTON THE PLANT PLANKTON AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FOOD CHAIN WHICH STIMULATE THE GROWTH OF ZOOPLANKTON WHICH FEED THE FISH AND THE KRILL AND ALL THE REST OF IT
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@497.85:517.68 AND EVENTUALLY THEY FILTER DOWN INTO THE ABYSS AND REMOVE THAT CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERIC SYSTEM WELL IT SEEMS THAT WHEN WHALES WERE AT THEIR HISTORIC POPULATIONS THEY WERE PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR SEQUESTERING SOME TENS OF MILLIONS OF TONS OF CARBON EVERY YEAR FROM THE ATMOSPHERE
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@517.68:530.6 AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT LIKE THAT YOU THINK WAIT A MINUTE HERE ARE THE WOLVES CHANGING THE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK HERE ARE THE WHALES CHANGING THE COMPOSITION OF THE ATMOSPHERE
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@530.6:542.49 YOU BEGIN TO SEE THAT POSSIBLY THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING JAMES LOVELOCK 'S GAIA HYPOTHESIS WHICH CONCEIVES OF THE WORLD AS A COHERENT SELF REGULATING ORGANISM IS BEGINNING
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@542.49:549.47 AT THE ECOSYSTEM LEVEL TO ACCUMULATE TROPHIC CASCADES
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@549.47:555.81 TELL US THAT THE NATURAL WORLD IS EVEN MORE FASCINATING AND COMPLEX THAN WE THOUGHT IT WAS
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@555.81:573.38 THEY TELL US THAT WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY THE LARGE ANIMALS YOU ARE LEFT WITH A RADICALLY DIFFERENT ECOSYSTEM TO ONE WHICH RETAINS ITS LARGE ANIMALS AND THEY MAKE IN MY VIEW A POWERFUL CASE FOR THE REINTRODUCTION OF MISSING SPECIES
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@588.92:603.87 IT HAS NO VIEW AS TO WHAT A RIGHT ECOSYSTEM OR A RIGHT ASSEMBLAGE OF SPECIES LOOKS LIKE IT DOESN 'T TRY TO PRODUCE A HEATH OR A MEADOW OR A RAIN FOREST OR A KELP GARDEN OR A CORAL REEF
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@603.87:609.58 IT LETS NATURE DECIDE AND NATURE BY AND LARGE IS PRETTY GOOD AT DECIDING
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@609.58:618.36 NOW I MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE TWO DEFINITIONS OF REWILDING THAT INTEREST ME THE OTHER ONE IS THE REWILDING OF HUMAN LIFE
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@618.36:627.13 AND I DON 'T SEE THIS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CIVILIZATION I BELIEVE WE CAN ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AS WE 'RE DOING NOW BUT
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@627.17:647 AT THE SAME TIME IF WE CHOOSE HAVE ACCESS TO A RICHER AND WILDER LIFE OF ADVENTURE WHEN WE WANT TO BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE WONDERFUL REWILDED HABITATS AND THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS ARE DEVELOPING MORE RAPIDLY THAN YOU MIGHT THINK POSSIBLE
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@690.34:698.12 PERHAPS WE SHOULD ALSO START THINKING ABOUT THE RETURN OF SOME OF OUR LOST MEGAFAUNA
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@698.12:701.77 WHAT MEGAFAUNA YOU SAY WELL EVERY CONTINENT
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@713.23:722.59 RHINOS ELEPHANTS HYENAS LIONS YES LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THERE WERE LIONS IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE LONG BEFORE NELSON 'S COLUMN WAS BUILT
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@722.59:726.1 ALL THESE SPECIES LIVED HERE
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@772.62:777.64 WHY ARE THEY SO MUCH TOUGHER AND HARDER TO BREAK THAN THE CANOPY TREES ARE
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@777.64:782.2 ELEPHANTS
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@782.2:799.73 THEY ARE ELEPHANT ADAPTED IN EUROPE FOR EXAMPLE THEY EVOLVED TO RESIST THE STRAIGHT TUSKED ELEPHANT ELEPHAS ANTIQUUS WHICH WAS A GREAT BEAST IT WAS RELATED TO THE ASIAN ELEPHANT BUT IT WAS A TEMPERATE ANIMAL A TEMPERATE FOREST CREATURE IT WAS A LOT BIGGER THAN THE ASIAN ELEPHANT
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@799.73:807.58 BUT WHY IS IT THAT SOME OF OUR COMMON SHRUBS HAVE SPINES WHICH SEEM TO BE OVER ENGINEERED TO RESIST BROWSING BY DEER
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@807.58:816.22 PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY EVOLVED TO RESIST BROWSING BY RHINOCEROS ISN 'T IT AN AMAZING THOUGHT THAT
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@816.22:831.19 EVERY TIME YOU WANDER INTO A PARK OR DOWN AN AVENUE OR THROUGH A LEAFY STREET YOU CAN SEE THE SHADOWS OF THESE GREAT BEASTS PALEOECOLOGY THE STUDY OF PAST ECOSYSTEMS CRUCIAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR OWN
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@831.19:846.93 FEELS LIKE A PORTAL THROUGH WHICH YOU MAY PASS INTO AN ENCHANTED KINGDOM AND IF WE REALLY ARE LOOKING AT AREAS OF LAND OF THE SORT OF SIZES I 'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BECOMING AVAILABLE
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@846.93:852.56 WHY NOT REINTRODUCE SOME OF OUR LOST MEGAFAUNA OR AT LEAST SPECIES CLOSELY RELATED TO THOSE WHICH HAVE BECOME
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@869.45:878.47 IN MOTIVATING PEOPLE TO LOVE AND DEFEND THE NATURAL WORLD AN OUNCE OF HOPE IS WORTH A TON OF DESPAIR
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G@889.8:896.92 THAT OUR SILENT SPRING COULD BE REPLACED BY A RAUCOUS SUMMER THANK YOU
