ShigeruBan_2013X@98.98:116.27 BECAUSE EACH COUNTRY MAKES A LOT OF PAVILIONS BUT AFTER HALF A YEAR WE CREATE A LOT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE SO MY BUILDING HAS TO BE REUSED OR RECYCLED AFTER THE BUILDING WAS RECYCLED SO THAT WAS THE GOAL OF MY DESIGN THEN
ShigeruBan_2013X@181.82:197.22 THEY HAVE MONEY AND POWER THOSE ARE INVISIBLE SO THEY HIRE US TO VISUALIZE THEIR POWER AND MONEY BY MAKING MONUMENTAL ARCHITECTURE THAT IS OUR PROFESSION EVEN HISTORICALLY IT 'S THE SAME
ShigeruBan_2013X@268.28:280.34 BUT OVER TWO MILLION PEOPLE CUT TREES IT JUST BECAME BIG HEAVY DEFORESTATION AND AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM THAT IS WHY THEY STARTED PROVIDING ALUMINUM PIPES ALUMINUM BARRACKS VERY EXPENSIVE THEY THROW THEM OUT FOR MONEY
ShigeruBan_2013X@280.34:289.63 THEN CUTTING TREES AGAIN SO I PROPOSED MY IDEA TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION USING THESE RECYCLED PAPER TUBES BECAUSE THIS IS SO CHEAP
ShigeruBan_2013X@317.96:333.19 AND ALSO I FOUND OUT THERE 'S MANY VIETNAMESE REFUGEES SUFFERING AND GATHERING AT A CATHOLIC CHURCH ALL THE BUILDING WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED SO I WENT THERE AND ALSO I PROPOSED TO THE PRIESTS WHY DON 'T WE REBUILD THE CHURCH OUT OF PAPER TUBES AND HE SAID
ShigeruBan_2013X@375.26:382.64 AND ALSO I STILL REMEMBER WE WERE EXPECTING TO HAVE A BEER INSIDE THE PLASTIC BEER CRATE BUT IT CAME EMPTY
ShigeruBan_2013X@426.47:429.5 WHAT IS A PERMANENT AND WHAT IS A TEMPORARY BUILDING
ShigeruBan_2013X@429.5:439.11 EVEN A BUILDING MADE IN PAPER CAN BE PERMANENT AS LONG AS PEOPLE LOVE IT EVEN A CONCRETE BUILDING CAN BE VERY TEMPORARY IF THAT IS MADE TO MAKE MONEY
ShigeruBan_2013X@538.01:543.81 AND I GOT HALF A MILLION EUROS FROM THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT TO REBUILD THIS TEMPORARY AUDITORIUM
ShigeruBan_2013X@547.18:566.51 THERE WAS A BIG EARTHQUAKE BUT IT 'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FLY OVER SO I WENT TO SANTO DOMINGO NEXT DOOR COUNTRY TO DRIVE SIX HOURS TO GET TO HAITI WITH THE LOCAL STUDENTS IN SANTO DOMINGO TO BUILD FIFTY UNITS OF SHELTER OUT OF LOCAL PAPER TUBES THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED IN JAPAN TWO YEARS AGO IN NORTHERN JAPAN
ShigeruBan_2013X@587.81:597.97 HOWEVER SOME OF THE FACILITY AUTHORITY DOESN 'T WANT US TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY SAID SIMPLY IT 'S BECOME MORE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THEM BUT IT 'S REALLY NECESSARY TO DO IT
ShigeruBan_2013X@632.92:640.03 HE ASKED ME TO BUILD THREE STORY HOUSING ON BASEBALL FIELDS I USED THE SHIPPING CONTAINER
ShigeruBan_2013X@640.03:659.7 AND ALSO THE STUDENTS HELPED US TO MAKE ALL THE BUILDING FURNITURE TO MAKE THEM COMFORTABLE WITHIN THE BUDGET OF THE GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO THE AREA OF THE HOUSE IS EXACTLY THE SAME BUT MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE MANY OF THE PEOPLE WANT TO STAY HERE FOREVER I WAS VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT
ShigeruBan_2013X@671.66:683.46 AND THE MOST IMPORTANT CATHEDRAL OF THE CITY THE SYMBOL OF CHRISTCHURCH WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED AND I WAS ASKED TO COME TO REBUILD THE TEMPORARY CATHEDRAL SO THIS IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION
ShigeruBan_2013X@683.46:689.98 AND I 'D LIKE TO KEEP BUILDING MONUMENTS THAT ARE BELOVED BY PEOPLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
