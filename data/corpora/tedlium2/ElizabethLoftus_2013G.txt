ElizabethLoftus_2013G@12.55:20.33 LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT A LEGAL CASE THAT I WORKED ON INVOLVING A MAN NAMED STEVE TITUS
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@20.33:32.3 TITUS WAS A RESTAURANT MANAGER HE WAS THIRTY ONE YEARS OLD HE LIVED IN SEATTLE WASHINGTON HE WAS ENGAGED TO GRETCHEN ABOUT TO BE MARRIED SHE WAS THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@32.3:43.73 AND ONE NIGHT THE COUPLE WENT OUT FOR A ROMANTIC RESTAURANT MEAL THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY HOME AND THEY WERE PULLED OVER BY A POLICE OFFICER YOU SEE TITUS CAR
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@43.81:47.48 SORT OF RESEMBLED A CAR THAT WAS DRIVEN
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@47.48:52.63 EARLIER IN THE EVENING BY A MAN WHO RAPED A FEMALE HITCHHIKER
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@52.63:69.87 AND TITUS KIND OF RESEMBLED THAT RAPIST SO THE POLICE TOOK A PICTURE OF TITUS THEY PUT IT IN A PHOTO LINEUP THEY LATER SHOWED IT TO THE VICTIM AND SHE POINTED TO TITUS PHOTO SHE SAID THAT ONE 'S THE CLOSEST
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@69.88:83.35 THE POLICE AND THE PROSECUTION PROCEEDED WITH A TRIAL AND WHEN STEVE TITUS WAS PUT ON TRIAL FOR RAPE THE RAPE VICTIM GOT ON THE STAND AND SAID I 'M ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE THAT 'S THE MAN
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@83.35:97.05 AND TITUS WAS CONVICTED HE PROCLAIMED HIS INNOCENCE HIS FAMILY SCREAMED AT THE JURY HIS FIANCEE COLLAPSED ON THE FLOOR SOBBING AND TITUS IS TAKEN AWAY TO JAIL
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@97.05:101.97 SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO AT THIS POINT WHAT WOULD YOU DO
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@101.97:106.08 WELL TITUS LOST COMPLETE FAITH IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@106.08:118.44 AND YET HE GOT AN IDEA HE CALLED UP THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER HE GOT THE INTEREST OF AN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST AND THAT JOURNALIST ACTUALLY FOUND THE REAL RAPIST
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@118.44:126.19 A MAN WHO ULTIMATELY CONFESSED TO THIS RAPE A MAN WHO WAS THOUGHT TO HAVE COMMITTED FIFTY RAPES IN THAT AREA
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@126.27:132.32 AND WHEN THIS INFORMATION WAS GIVEN TO THE JUDGE THE JUDGE SET TITUS FREE
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@132.32:151.08 AND REALLY THAT 'S WHERE THIS CASE SHOULD HAVE ENDED IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OVER TITUS SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THIS AS A HORRIBLE YEAR A YEAR OF ACCUSATION AND TRIAL BUT OVER IT DIDN 'T END THAT WAY TITUS WAS SO BITTER HE 'D LOST HIS JOB HE COULDN 'T GET IT BACK
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@151.13:166 HE LOST HIS FIANCEE SHE COULDN 'T PUT UP WITH HIS PERSISTENT ANGER HE LOST HIS ENTIRE SAVINGS AND SO HE DECIDED TO FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE POLICE AND OTHERS WHOM HE FELT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS SUFFERING
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@166:172.48 AND THAT 'S WHEN I REALLY STARTED WORKING ON THIS CASE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@172.48:180.61 HOW DID THAT VICTIM GO FROM THAT ONE 'S THE CLOSEST TO I 'M ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE THAT 'S THE GUY
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@180.61:188.99 WELL TITUS WAS CONSUMED WITH HIS CIVIL CASE HE SPENT EVERY WAKING MOMENT THINKING ABOUT IT AND JUST DAYS BEFORE
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@189.05:200.77 HE WAS TO HAVE HIS DAY IN COURT HE WOKE UP IN THE MORNING DOUBLED OVER IN PAIN AND DIED OF A STRESS RELATED HEART ATTACK HE WAS THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@200.77:215.57 SO I WAS ASKED TO WORK ON TITUS CASE BECAUSE I 'M A PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENTIST I STUDY MEMORY I 'VE STUDIED MEMORY FOR DECADES AND IF I MEET SOMEBODY ON AN AIRPLANE
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@215.85:232.73 THIS HAPPENED ON THE WAY OVER TO SCOTLAND IF I MEET SOMEBODY ON AN AIRPLANE AND WE ASK EACH OTHER WHAT DO YOU DO WHAT DO YOU DO AND I SAY I STUDY MEMORY THEY USUALLY WANT TO TELL ME HOW THEY HAVE TROUBLE REMEMBERING NAMES OR THEY 'VE GOT A RELATIVE WHO 'S GOT ALZHEIMER 'S OR SOME KIND OF MEMORY PROBLEM
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@232.74:250.66 BUT I HAVE TO TELL THEM I DON 'T STUDY WHEN PEOPLE FORGET I STUDY THE OPPOSITE WHEN THEY REMEMBER WHEN THEY REMEMBER THINGS THAT DIDN 'T HAPPEN OR REMEMBER THINGS THAT WERE DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY THEY REALLY WERE I STUDY FALSE MEMORIES
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@252.75:261.27 UNHAPPILY STEVE TITUS IS NOT THE ONLY PERSON TO BE CONVICTED BASED ON SOMEBODY 'S FALSE MEMORY
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@261.27:270.68 IN ONE PROJECT IN THE UNITED STATES INFORMATION HAS BEEN GATHERED ON THREE HUNDRED INNOCENT PEOPLE
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@270.68:285.06 THREE HUNDRED DEFENDANTS WHO WERE CONVICTED OF CRIMES THEY DIDN 'T DO THEY SPENT TEN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS IN PRISON FOR THESE CRIMES AND NOW DNA TESTING HAS PROVEN THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY INNOCENT
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@285.06:295.49 AND WHEN THOSE CASES HAVE BEEN ANALYZED THREE QUARTERS OF THEM ARE DUE TO FAULTY MEMORY FAULTY EYEWITNESS MEMORY
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@295.49:302.58 WELL WHY LIKE THE JURORS WHO CONVICTED THOSE INNOCENT PEOPLE AND THE JURORS WHO CONVICTED TITUS
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@302.58:320.05 MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT MEMORY WORKS LIKE A RECORDING DEVICE YOU JUST RECORD THE INFORMATION THEN YOU CALL IT UP AND PLAY IT BACK WHEN YOU WANT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OR IDENTIFY IMAGES BUT DECADES OF WORK IN PSYCHOLOGY HAS SHOWN THAT THIS JUST ISN 'T TRUE
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@320.05:331.86 OUR MEMORIES ARE CONSTRUCTIVE THEY 'RE RECONSTRUCTIVE MEMORY WORKS A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE A WIKIPEDIA PAGE YOU CAN GO IN THERE AND CHANGE IT BUT SO CAN OTHER PEOPLE
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@354.59:367.34 AND WE ASKED PEOPLE HOW FAST WERE THE CARS GOING WHEN THEY HIT EACH OTHER AND WE ASKED OTHER PEOPLE HOW FAST WERE THE CARS GOING WHEN THEY SMASHED INTO EACH OTHER AND IF WE ASKED THE LEADING SMASHED QUESTION
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@367.34:384.27 THE WITNESSES TOLD US THE CARS WERE GOING FASTER AND MOREOVER THAT LEADING SMASHED QUESTION CAUSED PEOPLE TO BE MORE LIKELY TO TELL US THAT THEY SAW BROKEN GLASS IN THE ACCIDENT SCENE WHEN THERE WASN 'T ANY BROKEN GLASS AT ALL
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@384.27:402.62 IN ANOTHER STUDY WE SHOWED A SIMULATED ACCIDENT WHERE A CAR WENT THROUGH AN INTERSECTION WITH A STOP SIGN AND IF WE ASKED A QUESTION THAT INSINUATED IT WAS A YIELD SIGN MANY WITNESSES TOLD US THEY REMEMBER SEEING A YIELD SIGN AT THE INTERSECTION NOT A STOP SIGN
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@402.62:413.3 AND YOU MIGHT BE THINKING WELL YOU KNOW THESE ARE FILMED EVENTS THEY ARE NOT PARTICULARLY STRESSFUL WOULD THE SAME KIND OF MISTAKES BE MADE WITH A REALLY STRESSFUL EVENT
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@413.3:423.13 IN A STUDY WE PUBLISHED JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO WE HAVE AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WHAT WAS UNUSUAL ABOUT THIS STUDY IS
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@423.13:427.96 WE ARRANGED FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE A VERY STRESSFUL EXPERIENCE
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@427.96:432.61 THE SUBJECTS IN THIS STUDY WERE MEMBERS OF THE U S MILITARY
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@432.61:449.76 WHO WERE UNDERGOING A HARROWING TRAINING EXERCISE TO TEACH THEM WHAT IT 'S GOING TO BE LIKE FOR THEM IF THEY ARE EVER CAPTURED AS PRISONERS OF WAR AND AS PART OF THIS TRAINING EXERCISE THESE SOLDIERS ARE INTERROGATED IN AN AGGRESSIVE
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@449.76:464.47 HOSTILE PHYSICALLY ABUSIVE FASHION FOR THIRTY MINUTES AND LATER ON THEY HAVE TO TRY TO IDENTIFY THE PERSON WHO CONDUCTED THAT INTERROGATION AND WHEN WE FEED THEM SUGGESTIVE INFORMATION
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@464.47:484.39 THAT INSINUATES IT 'S A DIFFERENT PERSON MANY OF THEM MISIDENTIFY THEIR INTERROGATOR OFTEN IDENTIFYING SOMEONE WHO DOESN 'T EVEN REMOTELY RESEMBLE THE REAL INTERROGATOR AND SO WHAT THESE STUDIES ARE SHOWING IS THAT WHEN YOU FEED PEOPLE MISINFORMATION
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@484.39:493.43 ABOUT SOME EXPERIENCE THAT THEY MAY HAVE HAD YOU CAN DISTORT OR CONTAMINATE OR CHANGE THEIR MEMORY
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@493.43:508.56 WELL OUT THERE IN THE REAL WORLD MISINFORMATION IS EVERYWHERE WE GET MISINFORMATION NOT ONLY IF WE 'RE QUESTIONED IN A LEADING WAY BUT IF WE TALK TO OTHER WITNESSES WHO MIGHT CONSCIOUSLY OR INADVERTENTLY FEED US
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@508.56:515.22 SOME ERRONEOUS INFORMATION OR IF WE SEE MEDIA COVERAGE ABOUT SOME EVENT WE MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCED
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@515.22:519.01 ALL OF THESE PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS KIND OF
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@519.01:522.05 CONTAMINATION OF OUR MEMORY
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@522.05:541.26 IN THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY S WE BEGAN TO SEE AN EVEN MORE EXTREME KIND OF MEMORY PROBLEM SOME PATIENTS WERE GOING INTO THERAPY WITH ONE PROBLEM MAYBE THEY HAD DEPRESSION AN EATING DISORDER AND THEY WERE COMING OUT OF THERAPY WITH A DIFFERENT PROBLEM
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@541.26:549.42 EXTREME MEMORIES FOR HORRIFIC BRUTALIZATIONS SOMETIMES IN SATANIC RITUALS SOMETIMES INVOLVING
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@549.42:568.48 REALLY BIZARRE AND UNUSUAL ELEMENTS ONE WOMAN CAME OUT OF PSYCHOTHERAPY BELIEVING THAT SHE 'D ENDURED YEARS OF RITUALISTIC ABUSE WHERE SHE WAS FORCED INTO A PREGNANCY AND THAT THE BABY WAS CUT FROM HER BELLY BUT THERE WERE NO PHYSICAL SCARS OR ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@568.48:571.1 THAT COULD HAVE SUPPORTED HER STORY
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@571.1:586.07 AND WHEN I BEGAN LOOKING INTO THESE CASES I WAS WONDERING WHERE DO THESE BIZARRE MEMORIES COME FROM AND WHAT I FOUND IS THAT MOST OF THESE SITUATIONS INVOLVED SOME PARTICULAR FORM
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@586.07:604.85 OF PSYCHOTHERAPY AND SO I ASKED WERE SOME OF THE THINGS GOING ON IN THIS PSYCHOTHERAPY LIKE THE IMAGINATION EXERCISES OR DREAM INTERPRETATION OR IN SOME CASES HYPNOSIS OR IN SOME CASES EXPOSURE TO FALSE INFORMATION WERE THESE
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@604.85:609.31 LEADING THESE PATIENTS TO DEVELOP THESE VERY BIZARRE
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@609.49:625.84 UNLIKELY MEMORIES AND I DESIGNED SOME EXPERIMENTS TO TRY TO STUDY THE PROCESSES THAT WERE BEING USED IN THIS PSYCHOTHERAPY SO I COULD STUDY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE VERY RICH FALSE MEMORIES
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@637.02:653.88 AND PLANTED A FALSE MEMORY THAT WHEN YOU WERE A KID FIVE OR SIX YEARS OLD YOU WERE LOST IN A SHOPPING MALL YOU WERE FRIGHTENED YOU WERE CRYING YOU WERE ULTIMATELY RESCUED BY AN ELDERLY PERSON AND REUNITED WITH THE FAMILY AND WE SUCCEEDED IN PLANTING THIS MEMORY
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@653.88:657.73 IN THE MINDS OF ABOUT A QUARTER OF OUR SUBJECTS
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@657.73:675.98 AND YOU MIGHT BE THINKING WELL THAT 'S NOT PARTICULARLY STRESSFUL BUT WE AND OTHER INVESTIGATORS HAVE PLANTED RICH FALSE MEMORIES OF THINGS THAT WERE MUCH MORE UNUSUAL AND MUCH MORE STRESSFUL SO IN A STUDY DONE IN TENNESSEE RESEARCHERS PLANTED THE FALSE MEMORY
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@675.98:678.54 THAT WHEN YOU WERE A KID YOU NEARLY DROWNED
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@678.56:691.02 AND HAD TO BE RESCUED BY A LIFE GUARD AND IN A STUDY DONE IN CANADA RESEARCHERS PLANTED THE FALSE MEMORY THAT WHEN YOU WERE A KID SOMETHING AS AWFUL AS BEING ATTACKED BY A VICIOUS ANIMAL
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@691.02:705.47 HAPPENED TO YOU SUCCEEDING WITH ABOUT HALF OF THEIR SUBJECTS AND IN A STUDY DONE IN ITALY RESEARCHERS PLANTED THE FALSE MEMORY WHEN YOU WERE A KID YOU WITNESSED DEMONIC POSSESSION
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@705.47:716.52 I DO WANT TO ADD THAT IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE WE ARE TRAUMATIZING THESE EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE BUT OUR STUDIES HAVE GONE THROUGH
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@720.15:728.82 THAT HAVE MADE THE DECISION THAT THE TEMPORARY DISCOMFORT THAT SOME OF THESE SUBJECTS MIGHT EXPERIENCE IN THESE STUDIES
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@741.95:745.23 WELL TO MY SURPRISE
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@745.23:763.21 WHEN I PUBLISHED THIS WORK AND BEGAN TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THIS PARTICULAR BRAND OF PSYCHOTHERAPY IT CREATED SOME PRETTY BAD PROBLEMS FOR ME HOSTILITIES PRIMARILY FROM THE REPRESSED MEMORY THERAPISTS WHO FELT UNDER ATTACK
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@763.22:766.64 AND BY THE PATIENTS WHOM THEY HAD INFLUENCED
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@766.64:777.54 I HAD SOMETIMES ARMED GUARDS AT SPEECHES THAT I WAS INVITED TO GIVE PEOPLE TRYING TO DRUM UP LETTER WRITING CAMPAIGNS TO GET ME FIRED BUT PROBABLY THE WORST
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@777.54:783.03 WAS I SUSPECTED THAT A WOMAN WAS INNOCENT OF ABUSE
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@783.03:797.48 THAT WAS BEING CLAIMED BY HER GROWN DAUGHTER SHE ACCUSED HER MOTHER OF SEXUAL ABUSE BASED ON A REPRESSED MEMORY AND THIS ACCUSING DAUGHTER HAD ACTUALLY ALLOWED HER STORY TO BE FILMED AND PRESENTED IN PUBLIC PLACES
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@797.48:808.8 I WAS SUSPICIOUS OF THIS STORY AND SO I STARTED TO INVESTIGATE AND EVENTUALLY FOUND INFORMATION THAT CONVINCED ME THAT THIS MOTHER WAS INNOCENT
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@808.8:821.24 I PUBLISHED AN EXPOSE ON THE CASE AND A LITTLE WHILE LATER THE ACCUSING DAUGHTER FILED A LAWSUIT EVEN THOUGH I 'D NEVER MENTIONED HER NAME SHE SUED ME FOR DEFAMATION
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@854.02:862.17 IF I PLANT A FALSE MEMORY IN YOUR MIND DOES IT HAVE REPERCUSSIONS DOES IT AFFECT YOUR LATER THOUGHTS YOUR LATER BEHAVIORS
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@862.17:878.49 OUR FIRST STUDY PLANTED A FALSE MEMORY THAT YOU GOT SICK AS A CHILD EATING CERTAIN FOODS HARD BOILED EGGS DILL PICKLES STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM AND WE FOUND THAT ONCE WE PLANTED THIS FALSE MEMORY PEOPLE DIDN 'T WANT TO EAT THE FOODS AS MUCH AT AN OUTDOOR PICNIC
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@878.49:884.14 THE FALSE MEMORIES AREN 'T NECESSARILY BAD OR UNPLEASANT IF WE PLANTED A WARM
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@902.25:911.87 WELL ALONG WITH THIS ABILITY TO PLANT MEMORIES AND CONTROL BEHAVIOR OBVIOUSLY COME SOME IMPORTANT ETHICAL ISSUES
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@911.87:918.32 LIKE WHEN SHOULD WE USE THIS MIND TECHNOLOGY AND SHOULD WE EVER BAN ITS USE
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@918.32:925.37 THERAPISTS CAN 'T ETHICALLY PLANT FALSE MEMORIES IN THE MIND OF THEIR PATIENTS EVEN IF IT WOULD HELP THE PATIENT
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@954.85:966.25 HAVE A KID WITH OBESITY DIABETES SHORTENED LIFESPAN ALL THE THINGS THAT GO WITH IT OR A KID WITH ONE LITTLE EXTRA BIT OF FALSE MEMORY I KNOW WHAT I WOULD CHOOSE FOR A KID OF MINE
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@966.25:983.47 BUT MAYBE MY WORK HAS MADE ME DIFFERENT FROM MOST PEOPLE MOST PEOPLE CHERISH THEIR MEMORIES KNOW THAT THEY REPRESENT THEIR IDENTITY WHO THEY ARE WHERE THEY CAME FROM AND I APPRECIATE THAT I FEEL THAT WAY TOO BUT I KNOW FROM MY WORK HOW MUCH FICTION
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@983.47:986.14 IS ALREADY IN THERE
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@986.14:1003.54 IF I 'VE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM THESE DECADES OF WORKING ON THESE PROBLEMS IT 'S THIS JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY TELLS YOU SOMETHING AND THEY SAY IT WITH CONFIDENCE JUST BECAUSE THEY SAY IT WITH LOTS OF DETAIL JUST BECAUSE THEY EXPRESS EMOTION WHEN THEY SAY IT IT DOESN 'T MEAN THAT IT REALLY HAPPENED
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@1003.54:1014.33 WE CAN 'T RELIABLY DISTINGUISH TRUE MEMORIES FROM FALSE MEMORIES WE NEED INDEPENDENT CORROBORATION SUCH A DISCOVERY HAS MADE ME MORE TOLERANT
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@1014.33:1027.36 OF THE EVERYDAY MEMORY MISTAKES THAT MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS MAKE SUCH A DISCOVERY MIGHT HAVE SAVED STEVE TITUS THE MAN WHOSE WHOLE FUTURE WAS SNATCHED AWAY
ElizabethLoftus_2013G@1033.56:1042.67 THAT MEMORY LIKE LIBERTY IS A FRAGILE THING THANK YOU
