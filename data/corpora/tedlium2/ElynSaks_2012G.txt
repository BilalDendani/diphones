ElynSaks_2012G I 'M A WOMAN WITH CHRONIC SCHIZOPHRENIA I 'VE SPENT HUNDREDS OF DAYS IN PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS I MIGHT HAVE ENDED UP SPENDING MOST OF MY LIFE ON THE BACK WARD OF A HOSPITAL BUT THAT ISN 'T HOW MY LIFE TURNED OUT
ElynSaks_2012G IN FACT I 'VE MANAGED TO STAY CLEAR OF HOSPITALS FOR ALMOST THREE DECADES PERHAPS MY PROUDEST ACCOMPLISHMENT
ElynSaks_2012G THAT 'S NOT TO SAY THAT I 'VE REMAINED CLEAR OF ALL PSYCHIATRIC STRUGGLES AFTER I GRADUATED FROM THE YALE LAW SCHOOL AND GOT MY FIRST LAW JOB MY NEW HAVEN ANALYST DR WHITE ANNOUNCED TO ME THAT HE WAS GOING TO CLOSE HIS PRACTICE IN THREE MONTHS SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE I HAD PLANNED TO LEAVE NEW HAVEN
ElynSaks_2012G I OPENED THE DOOR TO MY STUDIO APARTMENT STEVE WOULD LATER TELL ME THAT FOR ALL THE TIMES HE HAD SEEN ME PSYCHOTIC NOTHING COULD HAVE PREPARED HIM FOR WHAT HE SAW THAT DAY
ElynSaks_2012G FOR A WEEK OR MORE I HAD BARELY EATEN I WAS GAUNT I WALKED AS THOUGH MY LEGS WERE WOODEN
ElynSaks_2012G MY FACE LOOKED AND FELT LIKE A MASK I HAD CLOSED ALL THE CURTAINS IN THE APARTMENT SO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THE APARTMENT WAS IN NEAR TOTAL DARKNESS THE AIR WAS FETID THE ROOM A SHAMBLES
ElynSaks_2012G STEVE BOTH A LAWYER AND A PSYCHOLOGIST HAS TREATED MANY PATIENTS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND TO THIS DAY HE 'LL SAY I WAS AS BAD AS ANY HE HAD EVER SEEN
ElynSaks_2012G HI I SAID AND THEN I RETURNED TO THE COUCH WHERE I SAT IN SILENCE FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS THANK YOU FOR COMING STEVE CRUMBLING WORLD WORD VOICE TELL THE CLOCKS TO STOP TIME IS TIME HAS COME
ElynSaks_2012G WHITE IS LEAVING STEVE SAID SOMBERLY I 'M BEING PUSHED INTO A GRAVE THE SITUATION IS GRAVE I MOAN GRAVITY IS PULLING ME DOWN I 'M SCARED TELL THEM TO GET AWAY
ElynSaks_2012G AS A YOUNG WOMAN I WAS IN A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS FOR LENGTHY PERIODS MY DOCTORS DIAGNOSED ME WITH CHRONIC SCHIZOPHRENIA AND GAVE ME A PROGNOSIS OF GRAVE THAT IS AT BEST I WAS EXPECTED TO LIVE IN A BOARD AND CARE AND WORK AT MENIAL JOBS
ElynSaks_2012G FORTUNATELY I DID NOT ACTUALLY ENACT THAT GRAVE PROGNOSIS INSTEAD I 'M A CHAIRED PROFESSOR OF LAW PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY AT THE USC GOULD SCHOOL OF LAW I HAVE MANY CLOSE FRIENDS AND I HAVE A BELOVED HUSBAND WILL WHO 'S HERE WITH US TODAY
ElynSaks_2012G HE 'S DEFINITELY THE STAR OF MY SHOW
ElynSaks_2012G I 'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU HOW THAT HAPPENED AND ALSO DESCRIBE MY EXPERIENCE OF BEING PSYCHOTIC I HASTEN TO ADD THAT IT 'S MY EXPERIENCE BECAUSE EVERYONE BECOMES PSYCHOTIC IN HIS OR HER OWN WAY
ElynSaks_2012G LET 'S START WITH THE DEFINITION OF SCHIZOPHRENIA SCHIZOPHRENIA IS A BRAIN DISEASE ITS DEFINING FEATURE IS PSYCHOSIS OR BEING OUT OF TOUCH WITH REALITY DELUSIONS AND HALLUCINATIONS ARE HALLMARKS OF THE ILLNESS DELUSIONS ARE FIXED AND FALSE BELIEFS THAT AREN 'T RESPONSIVE TO EVIDENCE AND HALLUCINATIONS ARE FALSE SENSORY EXPERIENCES
ElynSaks_2012G FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I 'M PSYCHOTIC I OFTEN HAVE THE DELUSION THAT I 'VE KILLED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITH MY THOUGHTS I SOMETIMES HAVE THE IDEA THAT NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS ARE ABOUT TO BE SET OFF IN MY BRAIN
ElynSaks_2012G OCCASIONALLY I HAVE HALLUCINATIONS LIKE ONE TIME I TURNED AROUND AND SAW A MAN WITH A RAISED KNIFE
ElynSaks_2012G IMAGINE HAVING A NIGHTMARE WHILE YOU 'RE AWAKE
ElynSaks_2012G OFTEN SPEECH AND THINKING BECOME DISORGANIZED TO THE POINT OF INCOHERENCE LOOSE ASSOCIATIONS INVOLVES PUTTING TOGETHER WORDS THAT MAY SOUND A LOT ALIKE BUT DON 'T MAKE SENSE AND IF THE WORDS GET JUMBLED UP ENOUGH IT 'S CALLED WORD SALAD
ElynSaks_2012G CONTRARY TO WHAT MANY PEOPLE THINK SCHIZOPHRENIA IS NOT THE SAME AS MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER OR SPLIT PERSONALITY THE SCHIZOPHRENIC MIND IS NOT SPLIT BUT SHATTERED
ElynSaks_2012G EVERYONE HAS SEEN A STREET PERSON UNKEMPT PROBABLY ILL FED STANDING OUTSIDE OF AN OFFICE BUILDING MUTTERING TO HIMSELF OR SHOUTING
ElynSaks_2012G THIS PERSON IS LIKELY TO HAVE SOME FORM OF SCHIZOPHRENIA BUT SCHIZOPHRENIA PRESENTS ITSELF ACROSS A WIDE ARRAY OF SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH THE ILLNESS WHO ARE FULL TIME PROFESSIONALS WITH MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES
ElynSaks_2012G SEVERAL YEARS AGO I DECIDED TO WRITE DOWN MY EXPERIENCES AND MY PERSONAL JOURNEY AND I WANT TO SHARE SOME MORE OF THAT STORY WITH YOU TODAY TO CONVEY THE INSIDE VIEW
ElynSaks_2012G SO THE FOLLOWING EPISODE HAPPENED THE SEVENTH WEEK OF MY FIRST SEMESTER OF MY FIRST YEAR AT YALE LAW SCHOOL QUOTING FROM MY WRITINGS
ElynSaks_2012G MY TWO CLASSMATES REBEL AND VAL AND I HAD MADE THE DATE TO MEET IN THE LAW SCHOOL LIBRARY ON FRIDAY NIGHT TO WORK ON OUR MEMO ASSIGNMENT TOGETHER BUT WE DIDN 'T GET FAR BEFORE I WAS TALKING IN WAYS THAT MADE NO SENSE
ElynSaks_2012G MEMOS ARE VISITATIONS I INFORMED THEM THEY MAKE CERTAIN POINTS THE POINT IS ON YOUR HEAD PAT USED TO SAY THAT HAVE YOU KILLED YOU ANYONE
ElynSaks_2012G REBEL AND VAL LOOKED AT ME AS IF THEY OR I HAD BEEN SPLASHED IN THE FACE WITH COLD WATER WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ELYN OH YOU KNOW THE USUAL WHO 'S WHAT WHAT 'S WHO HEAVEN AND HELL LET 'S GO OUT ON THE ROOF IT 'S A FLAT SURFACE IT 'S SAFE REBEL AND VAL FOLLOWED AND THEY ASKED WHAT HAD GOTTEN INTO ME THIS IS THE REAL ME I ANNOUNCED WAVING MY ARMS ABOVE MY HEAD
ElynSaks_2012G AND THEN LATE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT ON THE ROOF OF THE YALE LAW SCHOOL I BEGAN TO SING AND NOT QUIETLY EITHER COME TO THE FLORIDA SUNSHINE BUSH DO YOU WANT TO DANCE ARE YOU ON DRUGS ONE ASKED ARE YOU HIGH HIGH ME NO WAY NO DRUGS COME TO THE FLORIDA SUNSHINE BUSH
ElynSaks_2012G WHERE THERE ARE LEMONS WHERE THEY MAKE DEMONS YOU 'RE FRIGHTENING ME ONE OF THEM SAID AND REBEL AND VAL HEADED BACK INTO THE LIBRARY I SHRUGGED AND FOLLOWED THEM
ElynSaks_2012G BACK INSIDE I ASKED MY CLASSMATES IF THEY WERE HAVING THE SAME EXPERIENCE OF WORDS JUMPING AROUND OUR CASES AS I WAS I THINK SOMEONE 'S INFILTRATED MY COPIES OF THE CASES I SAID WE 'VE GOT TO CASE THE JOINT I DON 'T BELIEVE IN JOINTS BUT THEY DO HOLD YOUR BODY TOGETHER
ElynSaks_2012G I ROCKED BACK AND FORTH MOANING IN FEAR AND ISOLATION
ElynSaks_2012G THIS EPISODE LED TO MY FIRST HOSPITALIZATION IN AMERICA I HAD TWO EARLIER IN ENGLAND CONTINUING WITH THE WRITINGS THE NEXT MORNING I WENT TO MY PROFESSOR 'S OFFICE TO ASK FOR AN EXTENSION ON THE MEMO ASSIGNMENT AND I BEGAN GIBBERING UNINTELLIGABLY AS I HAD THE NIGHT BEFORE AND HE EVENTUALLY BROUGHT ME TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM
ElynSaks_2012G ONCE THERE SOMEONE I 'LL JUST CALL THE DOCTOR AND HIS WHOLE TEAM OF GOONS SWOOPED DOWN LIFTED ME HIGH INTO THE AIR AND SLAMMED ME DOWN ON A METAL BED WITH SUCH FORCE THAT I SAW STARS THEN THEY STRAPPED MY LEGS AND ARMS TO THE METAL BED WITH THICK LEATHER STRAPS
ElynSaks_2012G BARELY HUMAN AND PURE TERROR THEN THE SOUND CAME AGAIN FORCED FROM SOMEWHERE DEEP INSIDE MY BELLY AND SCRAPING MY THROAT RAW
ElynSaks_2012G THIS INCIDENT RESULTED IN MY INVOLUNTARY HOSPITALIZATION ONE OF THE REASONS THE DOCTORS GAVE FOR HOSPITALIZING ME AGAINST MY WILL WAS THAT I WAS GRAVELY DISABLED TO SUPPORT THIS VIEW THEY WROTE IN MY CHART THAT I WAS UNABLE TO DO MY YALE LAW SCHOOL HOMEWORK I WONDERED WHAT THAT MEANT ABOUT MUCH OF THE REST OF NEW HAVEN
ElynSaks_2012G DURING THE NEXT YEAR I WOULD SPEND FIVE MONTHS IN A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL AT TIMES I SPENT UP TO TWENTY HOURS IN MECHANICAL RESTRAINTS ARMS TIED ARMS AND LEGS TIED DOWN ARMS AND LEGS TIED DOWN WITH A NET TIED TIGHTLY ACROSS MY CHEST I NEVER STRUCK ANYONE I NEVER HARMED ANYONE I NEVER MADE ANY DIRECT THREATS
ElynSaks_2012G IF YOU 'VE NEVER BEEN RESTRAINED YOURSELF YOU MAY HAVE A BENIGN IMAGE OF THE EXPERIENCE THERE 'S NOTHING BENIGN ABOUT IT
ElynSaks_2012G EVERY WEEK IN THE UNITED STATES IT 'S BEEN ESTIMATED THAT ONE TO THREE PEOPLE DIE IN RESTRAINTS THEY STRANGLE THEY ASPIRATE THEIR VOMIT THEY SUFFOCATE THEY HAVE A HEART ATTACK IT 'S UNCLEAR WHETHER USING MECHANICAL RESTRAINTS IS ACTUALLY SAVING LIVES OR COSTING LIVES
ElynSaks_2012G WHILE I WAS PREPARING TO WRITE MY STUDENT NOTE FOR THE YALE LAW JOURNAL ON MECHANICAL RESTRAINTS I CONSULTED AN EMINENT LAW PROFESSOR WHO WAS ALSO A PSYCHIATRIST AND SAID SURELY HE WOULD AGREE THAT RESTRAINTS MUST BE DEGRADING PAINFUL AND FRIGHTENING
ElynSaks_2012G I DIDN 'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO TELL HIM IN THAT MOMENT THAT NO WE 'RE NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM HIM WE DON 'T LIKE TO BE STRAPPED DOWN TO A BED AND LEFT TO SUFFER FOR HOURS ANY MORE THAN HE WOULD IN FACT UNTIL VERY RECENTLY AND I 'M SURE SOME PEOPLE STILL HOLD IT AS A VIEW THAT RESTRAINTS HELP PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS FEEL SAFE
ElynSaks_2012G I 'VE NEVER MET A PSYCHIATRIC PATIENT WHO AGREED WITH THAT VIEW TODAY I 'D LIKE TO SAY I 'M VERY PRO PSYCHIATRY BUT VERY ANTI FORCE I DON 'T THINK FORCE IS EFFECTIVE AS TREATMENT AND I THINK USING FORCE IS A TERRIBLE THING TO DO TO ANOTHER PERSON WITH A TERRIBLE ILLNESS
ElynSaks_2012G EVENTUALLY I CAME TO LOS ANGELES TO TEACH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW SCHOOL FOR YEARS I HAD RESISTED MEDICATION MAKING MANY MANY EFFORTS TO GET OFF
ElynSaks_2012G I FELT THAT IF I COULD MANAGE WITHOUT MEDICATION I COULD PROVE THAT AFTER ALL I WASN 'T REALLY MENTALLY ILL IT WAS SOME TERRIBLE MISTAKE MY MOTTO WAS THE LESS MEDICINE THE LESS DEFECTIVE MY L A ANALYST DR KAPLAN WAS URGING ME JUST TO STAY ON MEDICATION AND GET ON WITH MY LIFE BUT I DECIDED I WANTED TO MAKE ONE LAST COLLEGE TRY TO GET OFF
ElynSaks_2012G ALL AROUND ME I SENSED EVIL BEINGS POISED WITH DAGGERS THEY 'D SLICE ME UP IN THIN SLICES OR MAKE ME SWALLOW HOT COALS KAPLAN WOULD LATER DESCRIBE ME AS WRITHING IN AGONY
ElynSaks_2012G EVEN IN THIS STATE WHAT HE ACCURATELY DESCRIBED AS ACUTELY AND FORWARDLY PSYCHOTIC I REFUSED TO TAKE MORE MEDICATION THE MISSION IS NOT YET COMPLETE
ElynSaks_2012G IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE APPOINTMENT WITH KAPLAN I WENT TO SEE DR MARDER A SCHIZOPHRENIA EXPERT WHO WAS FOLLOWING ME FOR MEDICATION SIDE EFFECTS HE WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I HAD A MILD PSYCHOTIC ILLNESS ONCE IN HIS OFFICE I SAT ON HIS COUCH FOLDED OVER AND BEGAN MUTTERING
ElynSaks_2012G HEAD EXPLOSIONS AND PEOPLE TRYING TO KILL IS IT OKAY IF I TOTALLY TRASH YOUR OFFICE
ElynSaks_2012G YOU NEED TO LEAVE IF YOU THINK YOU 'RE GOING TO DO THAT SAID MARDER OKAY SMALL FIRE ON ICE TELL THEM NOT TO KILL ME TELL THEM NOT TO KILL ME WHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WITH THOUGHTS INTERDICTION
ElynSaks_2012G SECOND I HAVE MANY CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS WHO KNOW ME AND KNOW MY ILLNESS THESE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE GIVEN MY LIFE A MEANING AND A DEPTH AND THEY ALSO HELPED ME NAVIGATE MY LIFE IN THE FACE OF SYMPTOMS THIRD I WORK AT AN ENORMOUSLY SUPPORTIVE WORKPLACE AT USC LAW SCHOOL
ElynSaks_2012G EVEN WITH ALL THAT EXCELLENT TREATMENT WONDERFUL FAMILY AND FRIENDS SUPPORTIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT I DID NOT MAKE MY ILLNESS PUBLIC UNTIL RELATIVELY LATE IN LIFE AND THAT 'S BECAUSE THE STIGMA AGAINST MENTAL ILLNESS IS SO POWERFUL THAT I DIDN 'T FEEL SAFE WITH PEOPLE KNOWING
ElynSaks_2012G IF YOU HEAR NOTHING ELSE TODAY PLEASE HEAR THIS THERE ARE NOT SCHIZOPHRENICS THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AND THESE PEOPLE MAY BE YOUR SPOUSE THEY MAY BE YOUR CHILD THEY MAY BE YOUR NEIGHBOR THEY MAY BE YOUR FRIEND THEY MAY BE YOUR COWORKER
ElynSaks_2012G SO LET ME SHARE SOME FINAL THOUGHTS WE NEED TO INVEST MORE RESOURCES INTO RESEARCH AND TREATMENT OF MENTAL ILLNESS THE BETTER WE UNDERSTAND THESE ILLNESSES THE BETTER THE TREATMENTS WE CAN PROVIDE AND THE BETTER THE TREATMENTS WE CAN PROVIDE THE MORE WE CAN OFFER PEOPLE CARE AND NOT HAVE TO USE FORCE
ElynSaks_2012G ALSO WE MUST STOP CRIMINALIZING MENTAL ILLNESS IT 'S A NATIONAL TRAGEDY AND SCANDAL THAT THE L A COUNTY JAIL IS THE BIGGEST PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY IN THE UNITED STATES
ElynSaks_2012G AMERICAN PRISONS AND JAILS ARE FILLED WITH PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND MANY OF THEM ARE THERE BECAUSE THEY NEVER RECEIVED ADEQUATE TREATMENT I COULD HAVE EASILY ENDED UP THERE OR ON THE STREETS MYSELF
ElynSaks_2012G PLEASE CONTINUE TO LET US SEE CHARACTERS IN YOUR MOVIES YOUR PLAYS YOUR COLUMNS WHO SUFFER WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS PORTRAY THEM SYMPATHETICALLY AND PORTRAY THEM IN ALL THE RICHNESS AND DEPTH OF THEIR EXPERIENCE AS PEOPLE AND NOT AS DIAGNOSES
ElynSaks_2012G RECENTLY A FRIEND POSED A QUESTION IF THERE WERE A PILL I COULD TAKE THAT WOULD INSTANTLY CURE ME WOULD I TAKE IT
ElynSaks_2012G THE POET RAINER MARIA RILKE WAS OFFERED PSYCHOANALYSIS HE DECLINED SAYING DON 'T TAKE MY DEVILS AWAY BECAUSE MY ANGELS MAY FLEE TOO MY PSYCHOSIS ON THE OTHER HAND IS A WAKING NIGHTMARE IN WHICH MY DEVILS ARE SO TERRIFYING THAT ALL MY ANGELS HAVE ALREADY FLED SO WOULD I TAKE THE PILL IN AN INSTANT
ElynSaks_2012G THAT SAID I DON 'T WISH TO BE SEEN AS REGRETTING THE LIFE I COULD HAVE HAD IF I 'D NOT BEEN MENTALLY ILL NOR AM I ASKING ANYONE FOR THEIR PITY WHAT I RATHER WISH TO SAY IS THAT THE HUMANITY WE ALL SHARE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE MENTAL ILLNESS WE MAY NOT
ElynSaks_2012G WHAT THOSE OF US WHO SUFFER WITH MENTAL ILLNESS WANT IS WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS IN THE WORDS OF SIGMUND FREUD TO WORK AND TO LOVE THANK YOU
