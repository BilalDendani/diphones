ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@16.76:25.85 RESTAURANTS AND THE FOOD INDUSTRY IN GENERAL ARE PRETTY MUCH THE MOST WASTEFUL INDUSTRY IN THE WORLD FOR EVERY CALORIE OF FOOD WE CONSUME
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@36.84:48.02 IF ANYBODY WANTS TO TAKE IT HOME AND MASH IT LATER YOU'RE VERY WELCOME TO THE HUMBLE POTATO AND I'VE SPENT A LONG TIME TWENTY FIVE YEARS PREPARING THESE AND IT PRETTY MUCH GOES THROUGH EIGHT DIFFERENT FORMS IN ITS LIFETIME
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@48.60:55.92 FIRST OF ALL IT'S PLANTED AND THAT TAKES ENERGY IT GROWS AND IS NURTURED IT'S THEN HARVESTED
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@56.99:66.89 IT'S THEN DISTRIBUTED AND DISTRIBUTION IS A MASSIVE ISSUE IT'S THEN SOLD AND BOUGHT AND IT'S THEN DELIVERED TO ME I BASICALLY TAKE IT PREPARE IT AND
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@88.34:100.10 OKAY YOU ASK WHAT A SUSTAINABLE RESTAURANT LOOKS LIKE BASICALLY A RESTAURANT JUST LIKE ANY OTHER THIS IS THE RESTAURANT ACORN HOUSE FRONT AND BACK SO LET ME RUN YOU THROUGH A FEW IDEAS
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@100.72:109.63 FLOOR SUSTAINABLE RECYCLABLE CHAIRS RECYCLED AND RECYCLABLE TABLES FORESTRY COMMISSION THIS IS NORWEGIAN FORESTRY COMMISSION WOOD
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@110.08:118.78 THIS BENCH ALTHOUGH IT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE FOR MY MOM SHE DIDN'T LIKE SITTING ON IT SO SHE WENT AND BOUGHT THESE CUSHIONS FROM A LOCAL JUMBLE SALE REUSING A JOB THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@119.50:126.98 I HATE WASTE ESPECIALLY WALLS IF THEY'RE NOT WORKING PUT A SHELF ON IT WHICH I DID AND THAT SHOWS ALL THE CUSTOMERS MY PRODUCTS
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@127.29:136.15 THE WHOLE BUSINESS IS RUN ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY THIS IS POWERED BY WIND ALL OF THE LIGHTS ARE DAYLIGHT BULBS PAINT IS ALL LOW VOLUME CHEMICAL WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE WORKING IN THE ROOM
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@148.40:160.41 WILL THEY OUTLIVE ME THEY PROBABLY MIGHT RIGHT HERE 'S A RECONDITIONED COFFEE MACHINE IT ACTUALLY LOOKS BETTER THAN A BRAND NEW ONE SO LOOKING GOOD THERE NOW REUSING IS VITAL AND WE FILTER OUR OWN WATER
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@160.63:172.86 WE PUT THEM IN BOTTLES REFRIGERATE THEM AND THEN WE REUSE THAT BOTTLE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN HERE 'S A GREAT LITTLE EXAMPLE IF YOU CAN SEE THIS ORANGE TREE IT'S ACTUALLY GROWING IN A CAR TIRE WHICH HAS BEEN TURNED INSIDE OUT AND SEWN UP IT'S GOT MY COMPOST IN IT WHICH IS GROWING AN ORANGE TREE WHICH IS
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@174.30:185.80 THE KITCHEN WHICH IS IN THE SAME ROOM I BASICALLY CREATED A MENU THAT ALLOWED PEOPLE TO CHOOSE THE AMOUNT AND VOLUME OF FOOD THAT THEY WANTED TO CONSUME RATHER THAN ME PUTTING A DISH DOWN THEY WERE ALLOWED TO HELP THEMSELVES TO AS MUCH OR AS LITTLE AS THEY
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@187.05:194.85 OKAY IT'S A SMALL KITCHEN IT'S ABOUT FIVE SQ METERS IT SERVES TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY PEOPLE A DAY WE GENERATE QUITE A LOT OF WASTE THIS IS THE WASTE ROOM
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@214.20:225.70 I COMPOST IT IN THIS GARDEN ALL OF THE SOIL YOU CAN SEE THERE IS BASICALLY MY FOOD WHICH IS GENERATED BY THE RESTAURANT AND IT'S GROWING IN THESE TUBS WHICH I MADE OUT OF STORM FELLED TREES AND WINE CASKS AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@226.67:238.32 THREE COMPOST BINS GO THROUGH ABOUT SEVENTY KILOS OF RAW VEGETABLE WASTE A WEEK REALLY GOOD MAKES FANTASTIC COMPOST A COUPLE OF WORMERIES IN THERE TOO AND ACTUALLY ONE OF THE WORMERIES WAS A BIG WORMERY I HAD A LOT OF WORMS IN IT
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@254.96:267.13 SEEING HERE IS A WATER FILTRATION SYSTEM THIS TAKES THE WATER OUT OF THE RESTAURANT RUNS IT THROUGH THESE STONE BEDS THIS IS GOING TO BE MINT IN THERE AND I SORT OF WATER THE GARDEN WITH IT AND I ULTIMATELY WANT TO RECYCLE THAT PUT IT BACK INTO THE LOOS MAYBE WASH HANDS WITH
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@268.07:281.95 SO WATER IS A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT I STARTED MEDITATING ON THAT AND CREATED A RESTAURANT CALLED WATERHOUSE IF I COULD GET WATERHOUSE TO BE A NO CARBON RESTAURANT THAT IS CONSUMING NO GAS TO START WITH THAT WOULD BE GREAT I MANAGED TO DO IT
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@289.61:297.34 THIS IS AN ELECTRICAL RESTAURANT THE WHOLE THING IS ELECTRIC THE RESTAURANT AND THE KITCHEN AND IT'S RUN ON HYDROELECTRICITY SO I'VE GONE FROM AIR TO WATER
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@316.18:329.67 THIS IS BASICALLY AIR HANDLING I'M TAKING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CANAL OUTSIDE PUMPING IT THROUGH THE HEAT EXCHANGE MECHANISM IT'S TURNING THROUGH THESE AMAZING SAILS ON THE ROOF AND THAT IN TURN IS FALLING SOFTLY ONTO THE PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT COOLING THEM OR HEATING THEM AS THE
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@330.52:338.74 THIS IS AN ENGLISH WILLOW AIR DIFFUSER AND THAT'S SOFTLY MOVING THAT AIR CURRENT THROUGH THE ROOM VERY ADVANCED NO AIR CONDITIONING I LOVE IT
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@339.52:350.61 IN THE CANAL WHICH IS JUST OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT THERE IS HUNDREDS OF METERS OF COIL PIPING THIS TAKES THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CANAL AND TURNS IT INTO THIS FOUR DEGREES HEAT EXCHANGE I HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT WORKS BUT I PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR IT
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@352.68:361.17 AND WHAT'S GREAT IS ONE OF THE CHEFS WHO WORKS IN THAT RESTAURANT LIVES ON THIS BOAT IT'S OFF GRID IT GENERATES ALL ITS OWN POWER HE 'S GROWING ALL HIS OWN FRUIT AND THAT'S FANTASTIC
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@369.56:378.73 FIVE RESTAURANTS BASED ON THE FIVE CHINESE MEDICINE ACUPUNCTURE SPECIALITIES I'VE GOT WATER AND WOOD I'M JUST ABOUT TO DO FIRE
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@379.64:388.92 TO COME SO YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH YOUR SPACE FOR THAT OKAY SO THIS IS MY NEXT PROJECT FIVE WEEKS OLD IT'S MY BABY AND IT'S
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@401.16:408.98 PEOPLE I E PERHAPS MORE WORKING CLASS OR PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN A COOPERATIVE THIS IS A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE NOT FOR PROFIT
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@411.08:418.72 IT REALLY IS ABOUT THE SOCIAL DISCONNECT BETWEEN FOOD COMMUNITIES IN URBAN SETTINGS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO RURAL GROWERS
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@442.27:453.20 THAT'S ZERO FOOD WASTE AND NO ONE 'S DOING THAT JUST YET IN FACT SAINBURY 'S IF YOU'RE WATCHING TRY IT ON I'M GOING TO GET THERE BEFORE YOU SO NATURE
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@463.01:472.77 AND THAT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN NURTURING ME FOR SOME TIME AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT STATEMENT TO UNDERSTAND IF WE DON'T STAND UP AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@474.09:482.86 THINK ABOUT SUSTAINABLE FOOD THINK ABOUT THE SUSTAINABLE NATURE OF IT THEN WE MAY FAIL BUT I WANTED TO GET UP AND SHOW YOU THAT WE CAN DO IT IF WE'RE MORE
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@492.64:500.10 THE IDEA IS EMBRYONIC I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK THAT IF WE REDUCE REUSE REFUSE
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@501.76:508.99 RECYCLING IS THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE BUT IT'S THE FOUR R 'S RATHER THAN THE THREE R 'S THEN I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE ON OUR WAY
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G@509.95:521.98 SO THESE THREE ARE NOT PERFECT THEY'RE IDEAS I THINK THAT THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS TO COME BUT WITH HELP I'M SURE I'M GOING TO FIND SOLUTIONS AND I HOPE YOU ALL TAKE PART THANK YOU VERY MUCH
