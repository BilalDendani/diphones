EricWhitacre_2011@63.76:79.33 THE CHOIR PEOPLE IN MY HIGH SCHOOL WERE PRETTY GEEKY AND THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS GOING TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THOSE PEOPLE AND ABOUT A WEEK LATER A FRIEND OF MINE CAME TO ME AND SAID LISTEN YOU 'VE GOT TO JOIN CHOIR AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER WE 'RE TAKING A TRIP TO MEXICO ALL EXPENSES PAID AND THE SOPRANO SECTION IS JUST FULL OF

EricWhitacre_2011@86.44:89.07 AND I WENT TO MY FIRST DAY IN CHOIR
EricWhitacre_2011@89.07:101.57 AND I SAT DOWN WITH THE BASSES AND SORT OF LOOKED OVER MY SHOULDER TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY OPENED THEIR SCORES THE CONDUCTOR GAVE THE DOWNBEAT AND BOOM THEY LAUNCHED INTO THE KYRIE FROM THE REQUIEM BY MOZART
EricWhitacre_2011@101.57:118.99 IN MY ENTIRE LIFE I HAD SEEN IN BLACK AND WHITE AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS IN SHOCKING TECHNICOLOR THE MOST TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCE I 'VE EVER HAD IN THAT SINGLE MOMENT HEARING DISSONANCE AND HARMONY AND PEOPLE SINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER THE SHARED VISION
