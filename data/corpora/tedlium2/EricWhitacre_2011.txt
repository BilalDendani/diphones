EricWhitacre_2011 THEY WOULDN 'T HAVE ME I DIDN 'T READ MUSIC BUT I PLAYED SYNTHESIZERS AND DRUM MACHINES AND I GREW UP IN THIS LITTLE FARMING TOWN IN NORTHERN NEVADA AND I WAS CERTAIN THAT 'S WHAT MY LIFE WOULD BE AND WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN I WAS STUNNED TO FIND THAT THERE WAS NOT
EricWhitacre_2011 AND I SAID YES I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT IT SOUNDS GREAT AND I LEFT THE ROOM AND SAID NO WAY
EricWhitacre_2011 THE CHOIR PEOPLE IN MY HIGH SCHOOL WERE PRETTY GEEKY AND THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS GOING TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THOSE PEOPLE AND ABOUT A WEEK LATER A FRIEND OF MINE CAME TO ME AND SAID LISTEN YOU 'VE GOT TO JOIN CHOIR AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER WE 'RE TAKING A TRIP TO MEXICO ALL EXPENSES PAID AND THE SOPRANO SECTION IS JUST FULL OF
EricWhitacre_2011 HOT GIRLS
EricWhitacre_2011 AND SO I FIGURED FOR MEXICO AND BABES I COULD DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING
EricWhitacre_2011 AND I WENT TO MY FIRST DAY IN CHOIR
EricWhitacre_2011 AND I SAT DOWN WITH THE BASSES AND SORT OF LOOKED OVER MY SHOULDER TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY OPENED THEIR SCORES THE CONDUCTOR GAVE THE DOWNBEAT AND BOOM THEY LAUNCHED INTO THE KYRIE FROM THE REQUIEM BY MOZART
EricWhitacre_2011 IN MY ENTIRE LIFE I HAD SEEN IN BLACK AND WHITE AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS IN SHOCKING TECHNICOLOR THE MOST TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCE I 'VE EVER HAD IN THAT SINGLE MOMENT HEARING DISSONANCE AND HARMONY AND PEOPLE SINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER THE SHARED VISION
EricWhitacre_2011 AND I FELT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE THAT I WAS PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER THAN MYSELF
EricWhitacre_2011 AND THERE WERE A LOT OF CUTE GIRLS IN THE SOPRANO SECTION AS IT TURNS OUT
EricWhitacre_2011 I DECIDED TO WRITE A PIECE FOR CHOIR A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER AS A GIFT TO THIS CONDUCTOR WHO HAD CHANGED MY LIFE
EricWhitacre_2011 WELL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A FRIEND OF MINE EMAILED ME A LINK A YOUTUBE LINK AND SAID YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS AND IT WAS THIS YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAD POSTED A FAN VIDEO TO ME SINGING THE SOPRANO LINE TO A PIECE OF MINE CALLED SLEEP
EricWhitacre_2011 AND I HAD THIS IDEA IF I COULD GET FIFTY PEOPLE TO ALL DO THIS SAME THING SING THEIR PARTS SOPRANO ALTO TENOR AND BASS WHEREVER THEY WERE IN THE WORLD POST THEIR VIDEOS TO YOUTUBE WE COULD CUT IT ALL TOGETHER AND CREATE A VIRTUAL CHOIR
EricWhitacre_2011 SO I WROTE ON MY BLOG OMG OMG I ACTUALLY WROTE OMG HOPEFULLY FOR THE LAST TIME IN PUBLIC EVER
EricWhitacre_2011 AND IT 'S IN COMPLETE SILENCE WHEN I FILMED IT BECAUSE I WAS ONLY HEARING THE MUSIC IN MY HEAD IMAGINING THE CHOIR THAT WOULD ONE DAY COME TO BE AFTERWARDS I PLAYED A PIANO TRACK UNDERNEATH SO THAT THE SINGERS WOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO LISTEN TO AND THEN AS THE VIDEOS STARTED TO COME IN
EricWhitacre_2011 CHERYL ANG FROM SINGAPORE
EricWhitacre_2011 MASSACHUSETTS
EricWhitacre_2011 LOTS OF SINGERS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THIS THAT THEY SOMETIMES RECORDED FIFTY OR SIXTY DIFFERENT TAKES UNTIL THEY GOT JUST THE RIGHT TAKE THEY UPLOADED IT HERE 'S OUR WINNER OF THE SOPRANO SOLO
EricWhitacre_2011 THIS IS MELODY MYERS FROM TENNESSEE
EricWhitacre_2011 THANK YOU SCOTT I 'M SO GLAD THAT YOU FOUND ME AND SCOTT AGGREGATED ALL OF THE VIDEOS HE SCRUBBED THE AUDIO HE MADE SURE THAT EVERYTHING LINED UP AND THEN WE POSTED THIS VIDEO TO YOUTUBE ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO THIS IS LUX AURUMQUE SUNG BY THE VIRTUAL

EricWhitacre_2011 I LOVE THE IDEA THAT SHE 'S SINGING WITH HER SISTER ASIDE FROM THE BEAUTIFUL MUSIC IT 'S GREAT JUST TO KNOW I 'M PART OF A WORLDWIDE COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE I NEVER MET BEFORE BUT WHO ARE CONNECTED ANYWAY AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE
EricWhitacre_2011 WHEN I TOLD MY HUSBAND THAT I WAS GOING TO BE A PART OF THIS HE TOLD ME THAT I DID NOT HAVE THE VOICE FOR IT YEAH I 'M SURE A LOT OF YOU HAVE HEARD THAT TOO ME TOO
EricWhitacre_2011 IT HURT SO MUCH AND I SHED SOME TEARS BUT SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME WANTED TO DO THIS DESPITE HIS WORDS IT IS A DREAM COME TRUE TO BE PART OF THIS CHOIR AS I 'VE NEVER BEEN PART OF ONE WHEN I PLACED A MARKER ON THE GOOGLE EARTH MAP I HAD TO GO WITH THE NEAREST CITY WHICH IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILES AWAY FROM WHERE I LIVE
EricWhitacre_2011 AS I AM IN THE GREAT ALASKAN BUSH SATELLITE IS MY CONNECTION TO THE WORLD
EricWhitacre_2011 SO TWO THINGS STRUCK ME DEEPLY ABOUT THIS THE FIRST IS THAT HUMAN BEINGS WILL GO TO ANY LENGTHS NECESSARY TO FIND AND CONNECT
EricWhitacre_2011 WITH EACH OTHER IT DOESN 'T MATTER THE TECHNOLOGY
EricWhitacre_2011 AND THE SECOND IS THAT PEOPLE SEEM TO BE EXPERIENCING AN ACTUAL CONNECTION IT WASN 'T A VIRTUAL CHOIR THERE ARE PEOPLE NOW ONLINE THAT ARE FRIENDS THEY 'VE NEVER MET BUT I KNOW MYSELF TOO I FEEL THIS VIRTUAL ESPRIT DE CORPS IF YOU WILL WITH ALL OF THEM
EricWhitacre_2011 I FEEL A CLOSENESS TO THIS CHOIR ALMOST LIKE A FAMILY
EricWhitacre_2011 BUT WE DO HAVE THE FIRST THREE MINUTES AND IT 'S A TREMENDOUS HONOR FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO SHOW IT TO YOU HERE FIRST YOU 'RE THE VERY FIRST PEOPLE TO SEE THIS THIS IS SLEEP THE VIRTUAL CHOIR
