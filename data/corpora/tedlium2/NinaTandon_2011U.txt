NinaTandon_2011U@23.42:40.76 AND LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IT 'S LIKE TO GROW THESE CELLS IN THE LAB I WORK IN A LAB WHERE WE TAKE CELLS OUT OF THEIR NATIVE ENVIRONMENT WE PLATE THEM INTO DISHES THAT WE SOMETIMES CALL PETRI DISHES AND WE FEED THEM STERILELY OF COURSE WITH WHAT WE CALL CELL CULTURE MEDIA WHICH IS LIKE THEIR FOOD
NinaTandon_2011U@40.76:44.78 AND WE GROW THEM IN INCUBATORS WHY DO I DO THIS
NinaTandon_2011U@82.44:85.26 COPYING NATURE IN THE LAB
NinaTandon_2011U@85.68:91.26 LET 'S TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF THE HEART THE TOPIC OF A LOT OF MY RESEARCH WHAT MAKES THE HEART UNIQUE
NinaTandon_2011U@91.26:108.2 WELL THE HEART BEATS RHYTHMICALLY TIRELESSLY FAITHFULLY WE COPY THIS IN THE LAB BY OUTFITTING CELL CULTURE SYSTEMS WITH ELECTRODES THESE ELECTRODES ACT LIKE MINI PACEMAKERS TO GET THE CELLS TO CONTRACT IN THE LAB WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE HEART
NinaTandon_2011U@108.37:114.77 WELL HEART CELLS ARE PRETTY GREEDY NATURE FEEDS THE HEART CELLS IN YOUR BODY WITH A VERY VERY DENSE BLOOD SUPPLY
NinaTandon_2011U@114.77:132.6 IN THE LAB WE MICRO PATTERN CHANNELS IN THE BIOMATERIALS ON WHICH WE GROW THE CELLS AND THIS ALLOWS US TO FLOW THE CELL CULTURE MEDIA THE CELLS FOOD THROUGH THE SCAFFOLDS WHERE WE 'RE GROWING THE CELLS A LOT LIKE WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM A CAPILLARY BED IN THE HEART SO THIS BRINGS ME TO LESSON NUMBER ONE
NinaTandon_2011U@132.73:142.45 LIFE CAN DO A LOT WITH VERY LITTLE LET 'S TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF ELECTRICAL STIMULATION LET 'S SEE HOW POWERFUL JUST ONE OF THESE ESSENTIALS CAN BE
NinaTandon_2011U@142.45:149.94 ON THE LEFT WE SEE A TINY PIECE OF BEATING HEART TISSUE THAT I ENGINEERED FROM RAT CELLS IN THE LAB IT 'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A MINI MARSHMALLOW
NinaTandon_2011U@170.46:185.16 IN A SENSE TISSUE ENGINEERS HAVE A BIT OF AN IDENTITY CRISIS HERE BECAUSE STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS BUILD BRIDGES AND BIG THINGS COMPUTER ENGINEERS COMPUTERS BUT WHAT WE ARE DOING IS ACTUALLY BUILDING ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE CELLS THEMSELVES
NinaTandon_2011U@185.53:199.79 WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR US LET 'S DO SOMETHING REALLY SIMPLE LET 'S REMIND OURSELVES THAT CELLS ARE NOT AN ABSTRACT CONCEPT LET 'S REMEMBER THAT OUR CELLS SUSTAIN OUR LIVES IN A VERY REAL WAY
NinaTandon_2011U@199.81:204.65 WE ARE WHAT WE EAT COULD EASILY BE DESCRIBED AS WE ARE WHAT OUR CELLS EAT
NinaTandon_2011U@204.66:209.7 AND IN THE CASE OF THE FLORA IN OUR GUT THESE CELLS MAY NOT EVEN BE HUMAN
NinaTandon_2011U@209.7:224.28 BUT IT 'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT CELLS ALSO MEDIATE OUR EXPERIENCE OF LIFE BEHIND EVERY SOUND SIGHT TOUCH TASTE AND SMELL IS A CORRESPONDING SET OF CELLS THAT RECEIVE THIS INFORMATION AND INTERPRET IT FOR US
NinaTandon_2011U@224.28:239.44 IT BEGS THE QUESTION SHALL WE EXPAND OUR SENSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP TO INCLUDE THE ECOSYSTEM OF OUR OWN BODIES I INVITE YOU TO TALK ABOUT THIS WITH ME FURTHER AND IN THE MEANTIME I WISH YOU LUCK MAY NONE OF YOUR NON CANCER CELLS
NinaTandon_2011U@239.45:242.68 BECOME ENDANGERED SPECIES THANK YOU
