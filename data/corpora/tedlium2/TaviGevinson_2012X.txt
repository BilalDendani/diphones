TaviGevinson_2012X TODAY EXACTLY ACTUALLY I STARTED A FASHION BLOG CALLED STYLE ROOKIE LAST SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN I STARTED AN ONLINE MAGAZINE FOR TEENAGE GIRLS CALLED ROOKIEMAG COM MY NAME 'S TAVI GEVINSON AND
TaviGevinson_2012X THE TITLE OF MY TALK IS STILL FIGURING IT OUT AND THE MS PAINT QUALITY OF MY SLIDES WAS A TOTAL CREATIVE DECISION IN KEEPING WITH TODAY 'S THEME AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY INABILITY TO USE POWERPOINT
TaviGevinson_2012X AND YOU KNOW MOVIES AND TV SHOWS THESE THINGS HAVE INFLUENCE MY OWN WEBSITE
TaviGevinson_2012X SO I THINK THE QUESTION OF WHAT MAKES A STRONG FEMALE CHARACTER OFTEN GOES MISINTERPRETED
TaviGevinson_2012X AND INSTEAD WE GET THESE TWO DIMENSIONAL SUPERWOMEN WHO MAYBE HAVE ONE QUALITY THAT 'S PLAYED UP A LOT LIKE A CATWOMAN TYPE OR SHE PLAYS HER SEXUALITY UP A LOT AND IT 'S SEEN AS POWER BUT
TaviGevinson_2012X WOMEN TO BE THAT EASY TO UNDERSTAND
TaviGevinson_2012X AND WOMEN ARE MAD AT THEMSELVES FOR NOT BEING THAT SIMPLE WHEN IN ACTUALITY WOMEN ARE COMPLICATED WOMEN ARE MULTIFACETED NOT BECAUSE WOMEN ARE CRAZY BUT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY AND WOMEN HAPPEN TO BE PEOPLE
TaviGevinson_2012X I DON 'T LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE A PROBLEM WITHOUT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGING THOSE WHO WORK TO FIX IT SO JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE SHOWS LIKE MAD MEN MOVIES LIKE BRIDESMAIDS WHOSE FEMALE CHARACTERS OR PROTAGONISTS ARE COMPLEX MULTIFACETED
TaviGevinson_2012X I STILL FEEL THAT THERE ARE SOME TYPES OF WOMEN WHO ARE NOT REPRESENTED
TaviGevinson_2012X AND IN THE NINETY S THERE WAS FREAKS AND GEEKS AND MY SO CALLED LIFE AND THEIR CHARACTERS LINDSAY WEIR AND ANGELA CHASE I MEAN THE WHOLE PREMISE OF THE SHOWS WERE JUST THEM TRYING TO FIGURE THEMSELVES OUT BASICALLY
TaviGevinson_2012X BUT THOSE SHOWS ONLY LASTED A SEASON EACH AND I HAVEN 'T REALLY SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT ON TV SINCE
TaviGevinson_2012X SO THIS IS A SCIENTIFIC DIAGRAM OF MY BRAIN
TaviGevinson_2012X AROUND THE TIME WHEN I WAS WHEN I STARTED
TaviGevinson_2012X WATCHING THOSE TV SHOWS I WAS ENDING MIDDLE SCHOOL STARTING HIGH SCHOOL I 'M A SOPHOMORE NOW
TaviGevinson_2012X AND I WAS TRYING TO RECONCILE ALL OF THESE DIFFERENCES THAT YOU 'RE TOLD YOU CAN 'T BE WHEN YOU 'RE GROWING UP AS A GIRL YOU CAN 'T BE SMART AND PRETTY YOU CAN 'T BE A FEMINIST WHO 'S ALSO INTERESTED IN FASHION YOU CAN
TaviGevinson_2012X AND I FELT A LITTLE CONFUSED AND I SAID SO ON MY BLOG AND I SAID THAT I WANTED TO START
TaviGevinson_2012X A WEBSITE FOR TEENAGE GIRLS THAT WAS NOT THIS KIND OF
TaviGevinson_2012X ONE DIMENSIONAL STRONG CHARACTER EMPOWERMENT THING
TaviGevinson_2012X BECAUSE I THINK ONE THING THAT CAN BE VERY ALIENATING ABOUT A MISCONCEPTION OF FEMINISM IS THAT
TaviGevinson_2012X GIRLS THEN THINK THAT TO BE A FEMINIST THEY HAVE TO LIVE UP TO BEING PERFECTLY CONSISTENT IN YOUR BELIEFS NEVER BEING INSECURE NEVER HAVING DOUBTS HAVING ALL OF THE ANSWERS AND THIS IS NOT TRUE AND ACTUALLY
TaviGevinson_2012X RECONCILING ALL THE CONTRADICTIONS I WAS FEELING BECAME EASIER ONCE I UNDERSTOOD THAT FEMINISM WAS NOT A RULEBOOK BUT A DISCUSSION A CONVERSATION A PROCESS AND THIS IS A SPREAD FROM A ZINE THAT I MADE LAST YEAR WHEN I I
TaviGevinson_2012X I MEAN I THINK I 'VE LET MYSELF GO A BIT ON THE ILLUSTRATION FRONT SINCE BUT
TaviGevinson_2012X OF PEOPLE AND WE LAUNCHED LAST SEPTEMBER
TaviGevinson_2012X AND THIS IS AN EXCERPT FROM MY FIRST EDITOR 'S LETTER WHERE I SAY THAT ROOKIE WE DON 'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS WE 'RE STILL FIGURING IT OUT TOO BUT THE POINT IS NOT TO GIVE GIRLS THE ANSWERS
TaviGevinson_2012X AND NOT EVEN GIVE THEM PERMISSION TO FIND THE ANSWERS THEMSELVES BUT HOPEFULLY INSPIRE THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY CAN GIVE THEMSELVES THAT PERMISSION THEY CAN ASK THEIR OWN QUESTIONS FIND THEIR OWN ANSWERS ALL OF THAT AND ROOKIE I THINK WE 'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE IT A NICE PLACE FOR ALL OF THAT TO BE FIGURED
TaviGevinson_2012X I 'M FIGURING IT OUT
TaviGevinson_2012X WE ALSO HAVE ARTICLES CALLED HOW TO LOOK LIKE YOU WEREN 'T JUST CRYING IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES SO ALL OF THAT BEING SAID I STILL REALLY
TaviGevinson_2012X HOW YOU ACCEPT THOSE SO WHAT I YOU TO TAKE AWAY FROM MY TALK THE LESSON OF ALL OF THIS IS TO JUST BE STEVIE NICKS
TaviGevinson_2012X LIKE THAT 'S ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
TaviGevinson_2012X SHE IS VERY HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNAPOLOGETICALLY PRESENT ON STAGE AND UNAPOLOGETIC ABOUT HER FLAWS AND ABOUT RECONCILING ALL OF HER CONTRADICTORY FEELINGS AND SHE MAKES YOU LISTEN TO THEM AND THINK ABOUT THEM AND YEAH SO PLEASE BE STEVIE NICKS THANK YOU
