JuliaBacha_2011G@26.25:32.77 WHEN I TRAVEL WITH MY WORK ACROSS EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES ONE QUESTION ALWAYS COMES UP
JuliaBacha_2011G@32.82:42.06 WHERE IS THE PALESTINIAN GANDHI WHY AREN 'T PALESTINIANS USING NONVIOLENT RESISTANCE
JuliaBacha_2011G@42.06:61.04 THE CHALLENGE I FACE WHEN I HEAR THIS QUESTION IS THAT OFTEN I HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM THE MIDDLE EAST WHERE I SPENT MY TIME FILMING DOZENS OF PALESTINIANS WHO ARE USING NONVIOLENCE TO DEFEND THEIR LANDS AND WATER RESOURCES FROM ISRAELI SOLDIERS AND SETTLERS
JuliaBacha_2011G@61.04:75.45 THESE LEADERS ARE TRYING TO FORGE A MASSIVE NATIONAL NONVIOLENT MOVEMENT TO END THE OCCUPATION AND BUILD PEACE IN THE REGION YET MOST OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY NEVER HEARD ABOUT THEM
JuliaBacha_2011G@75.45:88.56 THIS DIVIDE BETWEEN WHAT 'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND AND PERCEPTIONS ABROAD IS ONE OF THE KEY REASONS WHY WE DON 'T HAVE YET A PALESTINIAN PEACEFUL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL
JuliaBacha_2011G@88.65:94.21 SO I 'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE POWER OF ATTENTION
JuliaBacha_2011G@94.38:96.56 THE POWER OF YOUR ATTENTION
JuliaBacha_2011G@107.66:122.4 I BELIEVE THAT WHAT 'S MOSTLY MISSING FOR NONVIOLENCE TO GROW IS NOT FOR PALESTINIANS TO START ADOPTING NONVIOLENCE BUT FOR US TO START PAYING ATTENTION TO THOSE WHO ALREADY ARE
JuliaBacha_2011G@140.32:147.89 THEY WOULD LOSE FORTY PERCENT OF THEIR LAND AND BE SURROUNDED SO THEY WOULD LOSE FREE ACCESS TO THE REST OF THE WEST BANK
JuliaBacha_2011G@147.89:162.03 THROUGH INSPIRED LOCAL LEADERSHIP THEY LAUNCHED A PEACEFUL RESISTANCE CAMPAIGN TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING LET ME SHOW YOU SOME BRIEF CLIPS SO YOU HAVE A SENSE FOR WHAT THAT ACTUALLY LOOKED LIKE ON THE GROUND
JuliaBacha_2011G@288.95:298.46 THAT THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA HAD FAILED TO COVER THE EXTRAORDINARY SET OF EVENTS THAT HAPPENED SEVEN YEARS AGO IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE
JuliaBacha_2011G@314.12:320.01 WHICH IS THE INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED BOUNDARY BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES
JuliaBacha_2011G@320.01:329.12 THE RESISTANCE IN BUDRUS HAS SINCE SPREAD TO VILLAGES ACROSS THE WEST BANK AND TO PALESTINIAN NEIGHBORHOODS IN JERUSALEM
JuliaBacha_2011G@329.74:335.25 YET THE MEDIA REMAINS MOSTLY SILENT ON THESE STORIES
JuliaBacha_2011G@335.25:347.16 THIS SILENCE CARRIES PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES FOR THE LIKELIHOOD THAT NONVIOLENCE CAN GROW OR EVEN SURVIVE IN PALESTINE
JuliaBacha_2011G@347.16:357.08 VIOLENT RESISTANCE AND NONVIOLENT RESISTANCE SHARE ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING IN COMMON THEY ARE BOTH
JuliaBacha_2011G@357.09:360.64 A FORM OF THEATER SEEKING AN AUDIENCE TO THEIR CAUSE
JuliaBacha_2011G@361.45:364.52 IF VIOLENT ACTORS ARE THE ONLY ONES
JuliaBacha_2011G@364.52:381.52 CONSTANTLY GETTING FRONT PAGE COVERS AND ATTRACTING INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION TO THE PALESTINIAN ISSUE IT BECOMES VERY HARD FOR NONVIOLENT LEADERS TO MAKE THE CASE TO THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE IS A VIABLE OPTION IN ADDRESSING THEIR PLIGHT
JuliaBacha_2011G@381.81:388.82 THE POWER OF ATTENTION IS PROBABLY GOING TO COME AS NO SURPRISE TO THE PARENTS IN THE ROOM
JuliaBacha_2011G@398.56:409.44 THE TANTRUM WILL BECOME WHAT CHILDHOOD PSYCHOLOGISTS CALL A FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR SINCE THE CHILD HAS LEARNED THAT HE CAN GET PARENTAL ATTENTION OUT OF IT
JuliaBacha_2011G@409.44:418.99 PARENTS CAN INCENTIVIZE OR DISINCENTIVIZE BEHAVIOR SIMPLY BY GIVING OR WITHDRAWING ATTENTION TO THEIR CHILDREN
JuliaBacha_2011G@418.99:434.53 BUT THAT 'S TRUE FOR ADULTS TOO IN FACT THE BEHAVIOR OF ENTIRE COMMUNITIES AND COUNTRIES CAN BE INFLUENCED DEPENDING ON WHERE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CHOOSES TO FOCUS ITS ATTENTION
JuliaBacha_2011G@434.53:452.96 I BELIEVE THAT AT THE CORE OF ENDING THE CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND BRINGING PEACE IS FOR US TO TRANSFORM NONVIOLENCE INTO A FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR BY GIVING A LOT MORE ATTENTION TO THE NONVIOLENT LEADERS ON THE GROUND TODAY
JuliaBacha_2011G@461.16:467.36 THAT EVEN ONE DOCUMENTARY FILM CAN HAVE IN INFLUENCING THE TRANSFORMATION
JuliaBacha_2011G@470.56:473.33 WHICH SITS VERY CLOSE TO JERUSALEM
JuliaBacha_2011G@493.54:504.97 SO WE ORGANIZED A SCREENING A WEEK LATER THEY HELD THE MOST WELL ATTENDED AND DISCIPLINED DEMONSTRATION TO DATE
JuliaBacha_2011G@527.23:543.57 THE LEADERS OF THIS MOVEMENT HAVE BEEN USING BUDRUS AS ONE OF THEIR PRIMARY RECRUITING TOOLS THEY REPORT THAT ISRAELIS WHO HAD NEVER BEEN ACTIVE BEFORE UPON SEEING THE FILM UNDERSTAND THE POWER OF NONVIOLENCE AND START JOINING THEIR ACTIVITIES
JuliaBacha_2011G@573.02:577.31 IN JERUSALEM NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE SHEIKH JARRAH AND SILWAN
JuliaBacha_2011G@577.41:582.04 THE NONVIOLENT LEADERS WOULD BECOME MORE VISIBLE
JuliaBacha_2011G@582.17:584.62 VALUED AND EFFECTIVE
JuliaBacha_2011G@603.1:605.52 IF WE DO THEY WILL MULTIPLY
JuliaBacha_2011G@606.14:623.24 IF THEY MULTIPLY THEIR INFLUENCE WILL GROW IN THE OVERALL ISRAELI PALESTINIAN CONFLICT AND THEIRS IS THE KIND OF INFLUENCE THAT CAN FINALLY UNBLOCK THE SITUATION THESE LEADERS HAVE PROVEN THAT NONVIOLENCE WORKS IN PLACES LIKE
