IvanOransky_2012P YOU WHO HAVE SEEN THE FILM MONEYBALL OR HAVE READ THE BOOK BY MICHAEL LEWIS WILL BE FAMILIAR WITH THE STORY OF BILLY BEANE BILLY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A TREMENDOUS BALLPLAYER ALL THE SCOUTS TOLD HIM SO THEY TOLD HIS PARENTS THAT THEY PREDICTED THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE A STAR
IvanOransky_2012P SAID THAT I SHOULD DO TOO AND I DID
IvanOransky_2012P AND YET EVERY DAY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE DIAGNOSED WITH PRECONDITIONS WE HEAR ABOUT PRE HYPERTENSION WE HEAR ABOUT PRE DEMENTIA WE HEAR ABOUT PRE ANXIETY AND I 'M PRETTY SURE THAT I DIAGNOSED MYSELF WITH THAT IN THE GREEN ROOM
IvanOransky_2012P WE ALSO REFER TO SUBCLINICAL CONDITIONS THERE 'S SUBCLINICAL ATHEROSCLEROSIS SUBCLINICAL HARDENING OF THE ARTERIES
IvanOransky_2012P OBVIOUSLY LINKED TO HEART ATTACKS POTENTIALLY IF YOU LOOK UP SUBCLINICAL ACNE YOU MAY FIND A WEBSITE WHICH I DID WHICH SAYS THAT THIS IS THE EASIEST TYPE OF ACNE TO TREAT
IvanOransky_2012P YOU
IvanOransky_2012P DON 'T HAVE THE PUSTULES OR THE REDNESS AND INFLAMMATION I HAVE A NAME FOR ALL OF THESE CONDITIONS IT 'S ANOTHER PRECONDITION I CALL THEM PREPOSTEROUS
IvanOransky_2012P FOLLOWS THE PRE SEASON BUT WITH A LOT OF THESE CONDITIONS THAT ACTUALLY ISN 'T THE CASE OR AT LEAST IT ISN 'T THE CASE ALL THE TIME IT 'S AS IF THERE 'S A RAIN DELAY EVERY SINGLE TIME IN MANY CASES WE HAVE PRE CANCEROUS LESIONS WHICH OFTEN DON 'T TURN INTO CANCER
IvanOransky_2012P AND SO IS IT ANY WONDER GIVEN ALL OF THE COSTS AND THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THE DRUGS THAT WE 'RE USING TO TREAT THESE PRECONDITIONS THAT EVERY YEAR WE 'RE SPENDING MORE THAN TWO TRILLION DOLLARS ON HEALTHCARE AND YET ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR AND THAT 'S A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE ARE DYING NOT BECAUSE OF THE CONDITIONS THEY HAVE
IvanOransky_2012P BUT BECAUSE OF THE TREATMENTS THAT WE 'RE GIVING THEM AND THE COMPLICATIONS OF THOSE TREATMENTS
IvanOransky_2012P WE 'VE MEDICALIZED EVERYTHING IN THIS COUNTRY
IvanOransky_2012P YOU NOW HAVE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU ONCE A MONTH THAT HAS BEEN MEDICALIZED IT 'S A CONDITION IT HAS TO BE TREATED STRIKE TWO IS IF YOU GET PREGNANT
IvanOransky_2012P YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TECH EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE SOMETHING MIGHT GO WRONG STRIKE THREE IS MENOPAUSE WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WHEN MILLIONS OF WOMEN WERE GIVEN HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS
IvanOransky_2012P FOR DECADES UNTIL ALL OF A SUDDEN WE REALIZED BECAUSE A STUDY CAME OUT A BIG ONE NIH FUNDED IT SAID ACTUALLY A LOT OF THAT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY MAY BE DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD FOR MANY OF THOSE WOMEN JUST IN CASE I DON 'T WANT TO LEAVE THE MEN OUT I AM ONE AFTER ALL
IvanOransky_2012P SO JUST TAKE A MOMENT IT 'S CALLED PRE DEATH
IvanOransky_2012P BUT THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS COMPLETELY BASICALLY PROMOTED THIS WE 'VE SELECTED AT EVERY POINT IN THIS SYSTEM A CONDITION IN SOME CASES
IvanOransky_2012P THE INDICATIONS EXPAND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A GIVEN TREATMENT WHO WANT TO MAKE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE FEEL THEY ARE AT RISK OR MIGHT HAVE A CONDITION SO THAT THEY CAN RAISE MORE FUNDS AND RAISE VISIBILITY
IvanOransky_2012P AND I DIDN 'T HAVE A COURSE CALLED HOW TO THINK SKEPTICALLY OR HOW NOT TO ORDER TESTS
IvanOransky_2012P WE HAVE THIS SYSTEM WHERE THAT 'S WHAT YOU DO AND IT ACTUALLY TOOK BEING A JOURNALIST TO UNDERSTAND ALL THESE INCENTIVES YOU KNOW ECONOMISTS LIKE TO SAY THERE ARE NO BAD PEOPLE THERE ARE JUST BAD INCENTIVES
IvanOransky_2012P BUT YOU CAN ACTUALLY PERVERSELY
IvanOransky_2012P TELL PEOPLE TO COME CONVINCE THEM THAT THEY HAVE TO COME IT WAS WHEN I BECAME A JOURNALIST THAT I REALLY REALIZED HOW I WAS PART OF THIS PROBLEM AND HOW WE ALL ARE PART OF THIS PROBLEM I WAS MEDICALIZING EVERY RISK FACTOR I WAS WRITING STORIES COMMISSIONING STORIES
IvanOransky_2012P EVERY DAY THAT WERE TRYING TO NOT NECESSARILY MAKE PEOPLE WORRIED ALTHOUGH THAT WAS WHAT OFTEN HAPPENED
IvanOransky_2012P BUT YOU KNOW THERE ARE WAYS OUT I SAW MY OWN INTERNIST LAST WEEK
IvanOransky_2012P AND HE SAID TO ME YOU KNOW AND HE TOLD ME SOMETHING THAT I NEED TO LOSE SOME WEIGHT
IvanOransky_2012P WELL HE 'S RIGHT I 'VE HAD HONEST TO GOODNESS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE FOR A DOZEN YEARS NOW SAME AGE MY FATHER GOT IT AND IT 'S A REAL DISEASE IT 'S NOT PRE HYPERTENSION IT 'S ACTUAL HYPERTENSION HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE WELL HE 'S RIGHT
IvanOransky_2012P HE LEARNED FROM WATCHING THIS KID WHO HE EVENTUALLY HIRED WHO WAS REALLY SUCCESSFUL FOR HIM LIKE THE SLUGGERS DO WHICH IS WHAT ALL THE EXPENSIVE TEAMS LIKE THE YANKEES LIKE TO THEY LIKE TO PICK UP THOSE GUYS
IvanOransky_2012P THIS KID TOLD HIM YOU KNOW YOU GOTTA WATCH THE GUYS AND YOU GOTTA GO OUT AND FIND THE GUYS WHO LIKE TO WALK BECAUSE GETTING ON BASE BY A WALK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT IS THAT REALLY A GOOD PITCH OR SHOULD WE LET IT GO BY AND NOT SWING AT EVERYTHING THANKS
