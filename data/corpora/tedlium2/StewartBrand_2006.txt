StewartBrand_2006 WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS THE END OF THE RISE OF THE WEST THAT'S OVER THE AGGREGATE NUMBERS ARE OVERWHELMING SO WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON WELL VILLAGES OF THE WORLD ARE EMPTYING OUT
StewartBrand_2006 THE QUESTION IS WHY
StewartBrand_2006 HERE 'S THE UNROMANTIC TRUTH
StewartBrand_2006 AND THE CITY AIR MAKES YOU FREE THEY SAID IN RENAISSANCE GERMANY SO SOME PEOPLE GO TO PLACES LIKE SHANGHAI BUT MOST GO TO THE SQUATTER CITIES WHERE AESTHETICS RULE
StewartBrand_2006 AND THESE ARE NOT REALLY A PEOPLE OPPRESSED BY POVERTY THEY'RE PEOPLE GETTING OUT OF POVERTY AS FAST AS THEY CAN THEY'RE THE DOMINANT BUILDERS AND TO A LARGE EXTENT THE DOMINANT DESIGNERS THEY HAVE HOME BREWED INFRASTRUCTURE AND VIBRANT URBAN LIFE ONE SIXTH OF THE GDP IN INDIA IS COMING OUT OF MUMBAI
StewartBrand_2006 ONE SIXTH OF HUMANITY IS THERE IT'S SOON GOING TO BE MORE THAN THAT
StewartBrand_2006 SO HERE 'S THE FIRST PUNCH LINE CITIES HAVE DEFUSED THE POPULATION BOMB
StewartBrand_2006 HERE 'S THE SECOND
