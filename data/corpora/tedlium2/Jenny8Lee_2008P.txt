Jenny8Lee_2008P@55.14:58.94 AMERICANS LOVE THEIR CHINESE FOOD SO MUCH THEY 'VE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IT INTO SPACE
Jenny8Lee_2008P@78.72:82.63 AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
Jenny8Lee_2008P@82.8:87.47 A LOT OF THE FOODS THAT YOU THINK OF OR WE THINK OF OR AMERICANS THINK OF AS CHINESE FOOD
Jenny8Lee_2008P@87.54:92.38 ARE BARELY RECOGNIZABLE TO CHINESE FOR EXAMPLE BEEF WITH BROCCOLI EGG ROLLS
Jenny8Lee_2008P@321.6:328 WE DON 'T KNOW THIS DISH AND THEN THEY 'RE LIKE IS THIS CHINESE FOOD BECAUSE IT DOESN 'T LOOK LIKE CHINESE FOOD TO THEM BUT THEY WEREN 'T KIND OF
Jenny8Lee_2008P@340.86:354.02 AND CAUSED THE WAR THAT KILLED TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE STILL THE DEADLIEST CIVIL WAR IN THE WORLD TO THIS DAY SO YOU KNOW I REALIZED WHEN I WAS THERE GENERAL TSO IS KIND OF A LOT LIKE COLONEL SANDERS IN AMERICA IN THAT
Jenny8Lee_2008P@359.69:368.67 BUT THE GRANDDADDY OF ALL THE CHINESE AMERICAN DISHES WE PROBABLY OUGHT TO TALK ABOUT IS CHOP SUEY WHICH WAS INTRODUCED AROUND THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
Jenny8Lee_2008P@369.04:376.19 AND ACCORDING TO NEW YORK TIMES IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FOUR THERE WAS AN OUTBREAK OF CHINESE RESTAURANTS ALL OVER TOWN AND THE CITY HAS GONE CHOP SUEY
Jenny8Lee_2008P@380.52:396.69 CHOP SUEY IS ACTUALLY NOT KNOWN IN CHINA AND AS THIS ARTICLE POINTS OUT THE AVERAGE NATIVE OF ANY CITY IN CHINA KNOWS NOTHING OF CHOP SUEY YOU KNOW BACK THEN IT WAS A WAY TO SHOW THAT YOU WERE SOPHISTICATED AND COSMOPOLITAN IF YOU WERE A GUY AND YOU WANTED TO IMPRESS A GIRL YOU COULD TAKE HER OUT ON A CHOP SUEY DATE
Jenny8Lee_2008P@455.81:466.79 AND NOT THE MOST PC QUESTION TO BE ASKED TODAY BUT IF YOU KIND OF LOOK AT THE POPULAR IMAGERY OF THE TIME NOT SO OUTLANDISH THIS IS ACTUALLY A REAL
Jenny8Lee_2008P@477.08:482.39 IN THEIR MIDST BECAUSE THE WAY THAT THE FOOD WAS PERCEIVED WAS
Jenny8Lee_2008P@482.53:497.61 THAT THESE PEOPLE WHO ATE FOODS DIFFERENT FROM US MUST BE DIFFERENT FROM US AND ANOTHER WAY THAT YOU SAW SORT OF THIS SORT OF THIS ANTIPATHY TOWARDS THE CHINESE IS THROUGH DOCUMENTS LIKE THIS THIS IS ACTUALLY IN THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS IT IS A PAMPHLET PUBLISHED BY SAMUEL GOMPERS HERO OF OUR AMERICAN LABOR MOVEMENT AND IT 'S CALLED SOME REASON
Jenny8Lee_2008P@497.61:511.69 FOR CHINESE EXCLUSION MEAT VERSUS RICE AMERICAN MANHOOD AGAINST ASIATIC COOLIEISM WHICH SHALL SURVIVE AND IT BASICALLY MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT CHINESE MEN WHO ATE RICE WOULD NECESSARILY BRING DOWN THE STANDARD OF LIVING FOR AMERICAN MEN WHO ATE MEAT
Jenny8Lee_2008P@511.69:519.94 AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THEN THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE MUST EXCLUDE THEM FROM THIS COUNTRY SO WITH SENTIMENTS LIKE THESE THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT WAS SORT OF
Jenny8Lee_2008P@526.41:536.09 A GROUP WAS SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED FOR ITS NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ETHNICITY SO IN A WAY BECAUSE THE CHINESE WERE ATTACKED CHOP SUEY WAS CREATED AS A
Jenny8Lee_2008P@600.27:606.13 BECAUSE MONDAY NIGHT IS CHINESE FOOD NIGHT AT MCMURDO STATION WHICH IS THE MAIN SCIENTIFIC STATION IN ANTARCTICA
Jenny8Lee_2008P@606.46:613.17 SO YOU SEE DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF CHINESE FOOD FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS FRENCH CHINESE FOOD WHERE THEY SERVE SALT AND PEPPER FROG LEGS
Jenny8Lee_2008P@638.65:655.77 THERE IS WEST INDIAN CHINESE FOOD THERE 'S JAMAICAN CHINESE FOOD THERE IS MIDDLE EASTERN CHINESE FOOD THERE 'S MAURITIAN CHINESE FOOD THIS IS A DISH CALLED MAGIC BOWL THAT I DISCOVERED THERE 'S INDIAN CHINESE FOOD KOREAN CHINESE FOOD JAPANESE CHINESE FOOD WHERE THEY TAKE THE BAO THE LITTLE BUNS AND THEY MAKE THEM INTO PIZZA VERSIONS
Jenny8Lee_2008P@801.19:803.01 YOU KNOW THERE ARE A BUNCH OF THEM INCLUDING
Jenny8Lee_2008P@811.25:824.29 IS THAT THEIR STORIES WERE SIMILAR BUT THEY WERE DIFFERENT IT WAS LUNCH IT WAS TAKE OUT IT WAS SIT DOWN IT WAS BUFFET IT WAS THREE WEEKS AGO IT WAS THREE MONTHS AGO BUT AT SOME POINT ALL THESE PEOPLE HAD A VERY SIMILAR EXPERIENCE THAT CONVERGED AT A FORTUNE COOKIE AND AT A CHINESE RESTAURANT
Jenny8Lee_2008P@824.41:830.08 AND ALL THESE CHINESE RESTAURANTS WERE SERVING FORTUNE COOKIES WHICH OF COURSE WE KNOW AREN 'T EVEN CHINESE TO BEGIN WITH SO IT
Jenny8Lee_2008P@834.09:840.14 LIKE IN ANT COLONIES WHERE LITTLE DECISIONS MADE BY ON THE MICRO LEVEL ACTUALLY HAVE A BIG IMPACT
Jenny8Lee_2008P@844.85:848.16 CHICKEN MCNUGGETS MCDONALD 'S ACTUALLY SPENT TEN YEARS COMING OUT WITH A CHICKEN
Jenny8Lee_2008P@921.21:928.59 YOU KNOW IN NEW ORLEANS WE HAVE CAJUN CHINESE FOOD WHERE THEY SERVE SICHUAN ALLIGATOR AND SWEET AND SOUR CRAWFISH RIGHT AND IN PHILADELPHIA YOU HAVE
Jenny8Lee_2008P@929.18:943.82 PHILADELPHIA CHEESESTEAK ROLL WHICH LOOKS LIKE AN EGG ROLL ON THE OUTSIDE BUT A CHEESESTEAK ON THE INSIDE I WAS REALLY SURPRISED TO DISCOVER THAT NOT ONLY IN PHILADELPHIA BUT ALSO IN ATLANTA BECAUSE WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS THAT A CHINESE FAMILY HAD MOVED FROM ATLANTA TO SORRY FROM PHILADELPHIA TO ATLANTA AND BROUGHT
Jenny8Lee_2008P@970.54:973.23 SO THE POINT OF MY PRESENTATION IS TO MAKE YOU THINK TWICE
Jenny8Lee_2008P@973.31:974.97 THAT THOSE
Jenny8Lee_2008P@974.97:981.39 WHOSE NAMES ARE FORGOTTEN IN HISTORY CAN OFTEN HAVE HAD AS MUCH IF NOT MORE IMPACT ON WHAT WE EAT TODAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
