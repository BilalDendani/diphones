HeribertWatzke_2010G@18.18:23.66 MADE A VERY IMPORTANT IMPACT ON US IT CHANGED THE WAY OUR HISTORY DEVELOPED
HeribertWatzke_2010G@24.73:33.52 BUT IT'S A TECHNOLOGY SO PERVASIVE SO INVISIBLE THAT WE FOR A LONG TIME FORGOT TO TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT
HeribertWatzke_2010G@34.21:42.16 ABOUT HUMAN EVOLUTION BUT WE SEE THE RESULTS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY STILL SO LET 'S MAKE A LITTLE TEST
HeribertWatzke_2010G@42.82:50.96 SO EVERYONE OF YOU TURNS TO THEIR NEIGHBOR PLEASE TURN AND FACE YOUR NEIGHBORS PLEASE ALSO ON THE BALCONY
HeribertWatzke_2010G@60.13:62.21 ANY CANINE TEETH
HeribertWatzke_2010G@67.96:73.30 THE MOUTHS OF YOUR NEIGHBORS OF COURSE NOT BECAUSE OUR DENTAL
HeribertWatzke_2010G@75.26:79.50 ACTUALLY MADE NOT FOR TEARING DOWN RAW MEAT FROM BONES
HeribertWatzke_2010G@79.96:87.90 OR CHEWING FIBROUS LEAVES FOR HOURS IT IS MADE FOR A DIET WHICH IS SOFT
HeribertWatzke_2010G@89.94:95.27 WHICH IS REDUCED IN FIBERS WHICH IS VERY EASILY CHEWABLE AND
HeribertWatzke_2010G@101.51:102.91 IT'S FOR COOKED FOOD
HeribertWatzke_2010G@104.50:106.64 WE CARRY IN OUR FACE THE PROOF
HeribertWatzke_2010G@114.54:121.92 SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE CHANGE HOW WE CLASSIFY OURSELVES WE TALK ABOUT OURSELVES AS OMNIVORES I WOULD SAY WE SHOULD CALL
HeribertWatzke_2010G@128.68:131.88 WE ARE THE ANIMALS WHO EAT COOKED FOOD
HeribertWatzke_2010G@133.76:136.57 NO NO NO NO BETTER TO LIVE OF COOKED FOOD
HeribertWatzke_2010G@137.21:140.55 SO COOKING IS A VERY IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY IT'S TECHNOLOGY
HeribertWatzke_2010G@141.45:154.35 I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL BUT I LIKE TO COOK FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND YOU NEED SOME DESIGN TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO COOKING IS A VERY IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE IT ALLOWED US
HeribertWatzke_2010G@154.90:159.89 TO ACQUIRE WHAT BROUGHT YOU ALL HERE THE BIG BRAIN
HeribertWatzke_2010G@160.79:165.72 THIS WONDERFUL CEREBRAL CORTEX WE HAVE BECAUSE BRAINS
HeribertWatzke_2010G@166.99:168.68 SO AS WE HAVE TO PAY TUITION FEES
HeribertWatzke_2010G@171.22:174.49 BUT IT'S ALSO METABOLICALLY SPEAKING EXPENSIVE
HeribertWatzke_2010G@175.96:184.57 OUR BRAIN IS TWO TO THREE PERCENT OF THE BODY MASS BUT ACTUALLY IT USES TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL ENERGY WE USE IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE WHERE DOES THE ENERGY COME FROM
HeribertWatzke_2010G@186.68:191.34 IF WE EAT RAW FOOD WE CANNOT RELEASE REALLY THE ENERGY
HeribertWatzke_2010G@192.26:202.25 SO THIS INGENUITY OF OUR ANCESTORS TO INVENT THIS MOST MARVELOUS TECHNOLOGY INVISIBLE EVERYONE OF US DOES IT EVERY DAY SO TO SPEAK
HeribertWatzke_2010G@212.34:218.34 SO IF WE THINK ABOUT THIS UNLEASHING HUMAN POTENTIAL WHICH WAS POSSIBLE
HeribertWatzke_2010G@218.71:222.75 BY COOKING AND FOOD WHY DO WE TALK SO BADLY ABOUT FOOD
HeribertWatzke_2010G@223.34:226.88 WHY IS IT ALWAYS DO AND DON'TS AND IT'S GOOD FOR YOU AND IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU
HeribertWatzke_2010G@227.72:230.05 I THINK THE GOOD NEWS FOR ME
HeribertWatzke_2010G@231.46:244.74 IF WE COULD GO BACK AND TALK ABOUT THE UNLEASHING THE CONTINUATION OF THE UNLEASHING OF HUMAN POTENTIAL NOW COOKING ALLOWED ALSO THAT WE BECAME A MIGRANT SPECIES WE WALKED OUT OF AFRICA
HeribertWatzke_2010G@246.14:248.58 ALL THE ECOLOGIES IF YOU CAN COOK
HeribertWatzke_2010G@274.71:281.77 THE BRAIN AND THE GUT WHICH IT ACTUALLY AFFECTED THE BRAIN COULD GROW BUT THE GUT ACTUALLY SHRUNK OKAY IT'S NOT OBVIOUS
HeribertWatzke_2010G@285.85:287.65 IT SHRUNK TO SIXTY PERCENT OF
HeribertWatzke_2010G@291.33:297.15 SO BECAUSE OF HAVING COOKED FOOD IT'S EASIER TO DIGEST
HeribertWatzke_2010G@298.02:307.55 NOW HAVING A LARGE BRAIN AS YOU KNOW IS A BIG ADVANTAGE BECAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY INFLUENCE YOUR ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN INFLUENCE YOUR OWN TECHNOLOGIES YOU HAVE INVENTED
HeribertWatzke_2010G@307.73:317.53 YOU CAN CONTINUE TO INNOVATE AND INVENT NOW THE BIG BRAIN DID THIS ALSO WITH COOKING BUT HOW DID IT ACTUALLY RUN THIS SHOW HOW DID IT ACTUALLY INTERFERE
HeribertWatzke_2010G@317.95:325.99 WHAT KIND OF CRITERIA DID IT USE AND THIS IS ACTUALLY TASTE REWARD AND ENERGY YOU KNOW WE HAVE UP TO FIVE
HeribertWatzke_2010G@326.89:328.10 THREE OF THEM SUSTAIN
HeribertWatzke_2010G@329.33:337.37 SWEET ENERGY UMAMI THIS IS A MEATY TASTE YOU NEED PROTEINS FOR MUSCLES RECOVERY
HeribertWatzke_2010G@350.64:354.10 POISONOUS AND ROTTEN MATERIAL BUT OF COURSE
HeribertWatzke_2010G@354.65:361.27 THEY ARE HARD WIRED BUT WE USE THEM STILL IN A SOPHISTICATED WAY THINK ABOUT BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE OR THINK ABOUT THE ACIDITY OF
HeribertWatzke_2010G@362.93:369.62 MIXED WITH STRAWBERRY FRUITS SO WE CAN MAKE MIXTURES OF ALL THIS KIND OF THING BECAUSE WE KNOW
HeribertWatzke_2010G@372.23:385.93 IN COOKING WE CAN TRANSFORM IT TO THE FORM REWARD THIS IS A MORE COMPLEX AND ESPECIALLY INTEGRATIVE FORM OF OUR BRAIN WITH VARIOUS DIFFERENT ELEMENTS
HeribertWatzke_2010G@386.67:391.22 THE EXTERNAL STATES OUR INTERNAL STATES HOW DO WE FEEL AND SO ON ARE PUT TOGETHER
HeribertWatzke_2010G@406.58:412.02 AND THE GUT IS A SILENT VOICE IT'S GOING MORE FOR FEELINGS I USE THE
HeribertWatzke_2010G@417.13:423.21 THE GUT IS CONCERNED WITH IF YOU GET A STOMACH ACHE IF YOU GET A
HeribertWatzke_2010G@430.23:435.96 SO MY STORY IS A TALE OF TWO BRAINS BECAUSE IT MIGHT SURPRISE YOU OUR GUT HAS A FULL FLEDGED BRAIN
HeribertWatzke_2010G@455.39:457.18 BUT WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE
HeribertWatzke_2010G@458.33:458.84 BRAIN
HeribertWatzke_2010G@460.09:463.76 THAT NOT ONLY THE BIG BRAIN HAS TO TALK
HeribertWatzke_2010G@465.24:469.48 WITH THE FOOD THE FOOD HAS TO TALK WITH THE BRAIN BECAUSE
HeribertWatzke_2010G@470.07:479.52 WE HAVE TO LEARN ACTUALLY HOW TO TALK TO THE BRAINS NOW IF THERE'S A GUT BRAIN WE SHOULD ALSO LEARN TO TALK WITH THIS BRAIN NOW ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO
HeribertWatzke_2010G@490.51:502.25 AND WITHIN THIS STRUCTURE YOU SEE THESE TWO PINKISH LAYERS WHICH ARE ACTUALLY THE MUSCLE AND BETWEEN THIS MUSCLE THEY FOUND NERVOUS TISSUES A LOT OF NERVOUS TISSUES WHICH PENETRATE ACTUALLY THE MUSCLE
HeribertWatzke_2010G@511.12:518.42 IT PENETRATES THE MUCOSA THIS IS THE LAYER WHICH ACTUALLY TOUCHES THE FOOD YOU ARE SWALLOWING AND YOU DIGEST WHICH IS
HeribertWatzke_2010G@520.34:523.74 NOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE GUT THE GUT IS IF YOU COULD STRETCH IT
HeribertWatzke_2010G@528.18:532.89 COULD UNROLL IT GET OUT ALL THE FOLD AND SO ON IT WOULD HAVE FOUR HUNDRED
HeribertWatzke_2010G@535.76:542.37 AND NOW THIS BRAIN TAKES CARE OVER THIS TO MOVE IT WITH THE MUSCLES AND TO DO DEFEND THE SURFACE AND OF COURSE
HeribertWatzke_2010G@545.34:552.97 SO IF WE GIVE YOU A SPECIFICATION THIS BRAIN WHICH IS AUTONOMOUS HAVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION NERVE CELLS ONE HUNDRED MILLION NEURONS
HeribertWatzke_2010G@553.66:557.28 SO AROUND THE SIZE OF A CAT BRAIN SO THERE SLEEPS
HeribertWatzke_2010G@560.27:562.24 FOR ITSELF OPTIMIZES
HeribertWatzke_2010G@564.23:566.28 IT HAS TWENTY DIFFERENT
HeribertWatzke_2010G@567.51:572.20 THE SAME DIVERSITY YOU FIND ACTUALLY IN A PIG BRAIN WHERE YOU HAVE ONE HUNDRED BILLION NEURONS
HeribertWatzke_2010G@573.07:580.70 IT HAS AUTONOMOUS ORGANIZED MICROCIRCUITS HAS THESE PROGRAMS WHICH RUN IT SENSES THE FOOD IT KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT TO DO
HeribertWatzke_2010G@581.10:591.10 IT SENSES IT BY CHEMICAL MEANS AND VERY IMPORTANTLY BY MECHANICAL MEANS BECAUSE IT HAS TO MOVE THE FOOD IT HAS TO MIX ALL THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS WHICH WE NEED
HeribertWatzke_2010G@592.66:601.42 OF MUSCLE IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE CAN BE REFLEXES IF YOU DON'T LIKE A FOOD ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE A CHILD YOU GAG IT'S THIS BRAIN WHICH MAKES THIS
HeribertWatzke_2010G@615.53:623.89 IT'S CALLED THE SUBSUMPTION ARCHITECTURE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT WE HAVE A LAYERED CONTROL SYSTEM THE LOWER LAYER OUR GUT BRAIN
HeribertWatzke_2010G@624.15:632.57 ITS OWN GOALS DIGESTION DEFENSE AND WE HAVE THE HIGHER BRAIN WITH THE GOAL OF INTEGRATION AND GENERATING BEHAVIORS
HeribertWatzke_2010G@633.09:646.13 NOW BOTH LOOK AND THIS IS THE BLUE ARROWS BOTH LOOK TO THE SAME FOOD WHICH IS IN THE LUMEN AND IN THE AREA OF YOUR INTESTINE THE BIG BRAIN INTEGRATES SIGNALS WHICH COME FROM THE RUNNING PROGRAMS OF THE LOWER BRAIN
HeribertWatzke_2010G@646.73:656.24 BUT SUBSUMPTION MEANS THAT THE HIGHER BRAIN CAN INTERFERE WITH THE LOWER IT CAN REPLACE OR IT CAN INHIBIT ACTUALLY SIGNALS
HeribertWatzke_2010G@656.63:666.33 SO IF WE TAKE TWO TYPES OF SIGNALS A HUNGER SIGNAL FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE AN EMPTY STOMACH YOUR STOMACH PRODUCES A HORMONE CALLED GHRELIN IT'S A VERY BIG SIGNAL
HeribertWatzke_2010G@666.84:667.84 IT'S SENT TO THE BRAIN
HeribertWatzke_2010G@676.76:676.90 THEY
HeribertWatzke_2010G@680.59:686.55 WHAT HAPPENS IF THE BIG BRAIN IN THE INTEGRATION OVERRIDES THE
HeribertWatzke_2010G@696.54:697.78 THE BIG BRAIN IGNORES IT
HeribertWatzke_2010G@698.48:700.81 AND ACTIVATES DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IN THE
HeribertWatzke_2010G@701.74:703.21 THE MORE USUAL CASE
HeribertWatzke_2010G@704.23:715.74 IS OVEREATING IT ACTUALLY TAKES THE SIGNAL AND CHANGES IT AND WE CONTINUE EVEN OUR EIGHT SIGNALS WOULD SAY STOP ENOUGH
HeribertWatzke_2010G@716.23:722.22 WE HAVE TRANSFERRED ENOUGH ENERGY NOW THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT ALONG THIS LOWER LAYER THIS
HeribertWatzke_2010G@722.99:725.96 THE SIGNAL BECOMES STRONGER AND STRONGER IF
HeribertWatzke_2010G@737.17:747.00 BE VERY VERY HIGH SO NOW BACK TO THE COOKING QUESTION AND BACK TO THE DESIGN WE HAVE LEARNED TO TALK TO THE BIG BRAIN TASTE AND REWARD AS YOU KNOW
HeribertWatzke_2010G@748.14:759.91 WHAT WOULD BE THE LANGUAGE WE HAVE TO TALK TO THE GUT BRAIN THAT IT'S SIGNALS ARE SO STRONG THAT THE BIG BRAIN CANNOT IGNORE IT THEN WE WOULD GENERATE SOMETHING ALL OF US WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
HeribertWatzke_2010G@760.49:763.34 A BALANCE BETWEEN THE HUNGER
HeribertWatzke_2010G@763.92:769.37 AND THE SATIATION NOW I GIVE YOU FROM OUR RESEARCH A VERY SHORT CLAIM THIS
HeribertWatzke_2010G@783.07:791.29 NOW EVERYONE WOULD EXPECT THAT WHEN THE DEGRADATION OF THE OIL HAPPENS WHEN THE CONSTITUENTS ARE LIBERATED THEY DISAPPEAR THEY GO AWAY BECAUSE THEY
HeribertWatzke_2010G@801.97:808.76 THIS WHOLE SYSTEM GENERATES A HUGE SURFACE TO ALLOW MORE ENZYMES TO ATTACK THE REMAINING OIL
HeribertWatzke_2010G@809.17:816.06 AND FINALLY ON YOUR RIGHT SIDE YOU SEE A BUBBLY CELL LIKE STRUCTURE APPEARING FROM WHICH THE BODY
HeribertWatzke_2010G@818.22:824.80 NOW IF WE COULD TAKE THIS LANGUAGE AND THIS IS A LANGUAGE OF STRUCTURES AND MAKE IT
HeribertWatzke_2010G@826.39:835.22 LASTING THAT IT CAN GO THROUGH THE PASSAGE OF THE INTESTINE IT WOULD GENERATE STRONGER SIGNALS
HeribertWatzke_2010G@835.78:847.99 SO OUR RESEARCH AND I THINK THE RESEARCH ALSO AT THE UNIVERSITIES ARE NOW FIXING ON THESE POINTS TO SAY HOW CAN WE ACTUALLY AND THIS MIGHT SOUND TRIVIAL NOW TO YOU HOW CAN WE CHANGE COOKING HOW CAN
HeribertWatzke_2010G@849.30:861.87 THAT WE HAVE THIS LANGUAGE DEVELOPED SO WHAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY IT'S NOT AN OMNIVORE 'S DILEMMA WE HAVE A COCTIVOR 'S OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE WE HAVE LEARNED OVER THE LAST TWO MILLION YEARS
HeribertWatzke_2010G@862.57:873.21 WHICH TASTE AND REWARD QUITE SOPHISTICATED TO COOK TO PLEASE OURSELVES TO SATISFY OURSELVES IF WE ADD THE MATRIX IF WE ADD THE STRUCTURE LANGUAGE WHICH WE HAVE TO
HeribertWatzke_2010G@874.06:885.78 WHEN WE LEARN IT THEN WE CAN PUT IT BACK AND AROUND ENERGY WE COULD GENERATE A BALANCE WHICH COMES OUT FROM OUR REALLY PRIMORDIAL OPERATION COOKING SO
HeribertWatzke_2010G@886.30:889.96 TO MAKE COOKING REALLY A VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT
HeribertWatzke_2010G@890.87:899.11 I WOULD SAY EVEN PHILOSOPHERS HAVE TO CHANGE AND HAVE TO FINALLY RECOGNIZE THAT COOKING IS WHAT MADE US SO I WOULD SAY COQUO
