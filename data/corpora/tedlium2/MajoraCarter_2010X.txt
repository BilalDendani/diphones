MajoraCarter_2010X SO TODAY I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT SOME PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T MOVE OUT OF THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS THE FIRST ONE IS HAPPENING
MajoraCarter_2010X RIGHT HERE IN CHICAGO BRENDA PALMS FARBER WAS HIRED TO HELP EX CONVICTS REENTER SOCIETY AND KEEP THEM FROM GOING BACK INTO PRISON
MajoraCarter_2010X NOT SO OBVIOUS SOLUTION CREATE A BUSINESS THAT PRODUCES SKIN CARE PRODUCTS FROM HONEY OKAY IT MIGHT BE OBVIOUS TO SOME OF YOU IT WASN'T TO ME IT'S THE BASIS OF GROWING A FORM OF SOCIAL INNOVATION THAT HAS REAL POTENTIAL
MajoraCarter_2010X SHE HIRED SEEMINGLY UNEMPLOYABLE MEN AND WOMEN TO CARE FOR THE BEES HARVEST THE HONEY AND MAKE VALUE ADDED PRODUCTS THAT THEY MARKETED THEMSELVES AND THAT WERE LATER SOLD AT WHOLE FOODS
MajoraCarter_2010X SHE COMBINED EMPLOYMENT EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING WITH LIFE SKILLS THEY NEEDED LIKE ANGER MANAGEMENT AND TEAMWORK AND ALSO HOW TO TALK TO
MajoraCarter_2010X FUTURE EMPLOYERS ABOUT HOW THEIR EXPERIENCES ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATED THE LESSONS THAT THEY HAD LEARNED AND THEIR EAGERNESS TO LEARN MORE LESS THAN FOUR PERCENT OF THE FOLKS THAT WENT THROUGH HER PROGRAM ACTUALLY GO BACK TO JAIL
MajoraCarter_2010X SO THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN LEARNED JOB READINESS AND LIFE SKILLS THROUGH BEE KEEPING AND BECAME PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS IN THE PROCESS TALK ABOUT A SWEET BEGINNING
MajoraCarter_2010X NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU TO LOS ANGELES AND LOTS OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT L A HAS ITS ISSUES BUT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT L A S WATER ISSUES RIGHT NOW
MajoraCarter_2010X THEY HAVE NOT ENOUGH WATER ON MOST DAYS AND TOO MUCH TO HANDLE WHEN IT RAINS CURRENTLY TWENTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA 'S ENERGY
MajoraCarter_2010X CONSUMPTION IS USED TO PUMP WATER INTO MOSTLY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THEIR SPENDING LOADS LOADS TO CHANNEL THAT RAINWATER OUT INTO THE OCEAN WHEN IT RAINS AND FLOODS AS WELL
MajoraCarter_2010X NOW ANDY LIPKIS IS WORKING TO HELP L A CUT INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH WATER MANAGEMENT AND URBAN HEAT ISLAND LINKING TREES PEOPLE AND TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE A MORE LIVABLE CITY
MajoraCarter_2010X ALL THAT GREEN STUFF ACTUALLY NATURALLY ABSORBS STORM WATER ALSO HELPS COOL OUR CITIES BECAUSE COME TO THINK ABOUT IT DO YOU REALLY WANT AIR CONDITIONING OR
MajoraCarter_2010X IS IT A COOLER ROOM THAT YOU WANT HOW YOU GET IT SHOULDN 'T MAKE THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE SO A FEW YEARS AGO L A
MajoraCarter_2010X COUNTY DECIDED THAT THEY NEEDED TO SPEND TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO REPAIR THE CITY SCHOOLS AND
MajoraCarter_2010X HIS TEAM DISCOVERED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SPEND TWO HUNDRED MILLION OF THOSE DOLLARS ON ASPHALT TO SURROUND THE SCHOOLS THEMSELVES AND
MajoraCarter_2010X BY PRESENTING A REALLY STRONG ECONOMIC CASE THEY CONVINCED THE L A GOVERNMENT THAT REPLACING THAT ASPHALT WITH TREES AND OTHER GREENERY THAT THE SCHOOLS THEMSELVES WOULD SAVE THE SYSTEM MORE ON ENERGY THAN THEY SPEND ON HORTICULTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE
MajoraCarter_2010X SO ULTIMATELY TWENTY MILLION SQ FT OF ASPHALT WAS REPLACED OR AVOIDED AND ELECTRICAL CONSUMPTION FOR AIR CONDITIONING WENT DOWN WHILE EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN
MajoraCarter_2010X FAMILY HAS EIGHT GENERATIONS IN A TOWN CALLED WHITESVILLE WEST VIRGINIA AND IF ANYONE SHOULD BE CLINGING TO THE FORMER GLORY OF THE COAL MINING HISTORY
MajoraCarter_2010X AND OF THE TOWN IT SHOULD BE JUDY BUT THE WAY COAL IS MINED RIGHT NOW IS DIFFERENT FROM THE DEEP MINES THAT HER FATHER AND HER FATHER 'S FATHER WOULD GO DOWN INTO AND THAT EMPLOYED ESSENTIALLY THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE NOW TWO DOZEN MEN
MajoraCarter_2010X CAN TEAR DOWN A MOUNTAIN IN SEVERAL MONTHS AND ONLY FOR ABOUT A FEW YEARS WORTH OF COAL THAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY IS CALLED MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL IT CAN MAKE A MOUNTAIN GO FROM THIS TO THIS
MajoraCarter_2010X IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS JUST IMAGINE THAT THE AIR SURROUNDING THESE PLACES IT'S FILLED WITH THE RESIDUE OF EXPLOSIVES AND COAL WHEN WE VISITED IT GAVE SOME OF THE PEOPLE WE WERE WITH THIS STRANGE LITTLE COUGH AFTER BEING ONLY THERE FOR JUST A FEW HOURS OR SO NOT JUST MINERS BUT EVERYBODY
MajoraCarter_2010X AND JUDY SAW HER LANDSCAPE BEING DESTROYED AND HER WATER POISONED AND THE COAL COMPANIES JUST MOVE ON AFTER THE MOUNTAIN WAS EMPTIED LEAVING EVEN MORE UNEMPLOYMENT IN THEIR WAKE
MajoraCarter_2010X BUT SHE ALSO SAW THE DIFFERENCE IN POTENTIAL WIND ENERGY ON AN INTACT MOUNTAIN AND ONE THAT WAS REDUCED IN ELEVATION BY OVER TWO THOUSAND
MajoraCarter_2010X THREE YEARS OF DIRTY ENERGY WITH NOT MANY JOBS OR CENTURIES OF CLEAN ENERGY WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPING EXPERTISE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN EFFICIENCY BASED ON TECHNICAL SKILLS AND DEVELOPING LOCAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THAT
MajoraCarter_2010X SHE CALCULATED THE UP FRONT COST AND THE PAYBACK OVER TIME AND IT'S A NET PLUS ON SO MANY LEVELS FOR THE LOCAL NATIONAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMY
MajoraCarter_2010X IT'S A LONGER PAYBACK THAN MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL BUT THE WIND ENERGY ACTUALLY PAYS BACK FOREVER NOW MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL PAYS VERY LITTLE MONEY TO THE LOCALS AND IT GIVES THEM A LOT OF MISERY THE
MajoraCarter_2010X IS TURNED INTO GOO MOST PEOPLE ARE STILL UNEMPLOYED LEADING TO MOST OF THE SAME KINDS OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS THAT UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE IN INNER CITIES ALSO EXPERIENCE
MajoraCarter_2010X LITERALLY HER HOMETOWN IS CALLED WHITESVILLE WEST VIRGINIA I MEAN THEY ARE NOT
MajoraCarter_2010X FOR THE BIRTHPLACE OF HIP HOP TITLE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT THE BACK OF
MajoraCarter_2010X SHE GAVE ME SAYS SAVE THE ENDANGERED HILLBILLIES
MajoraCarter_2010X SO
MajoraCarter_2010X AND HILLBILLIES WE GOT IT TOGETHER AND TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
MajoraCarter_2010X BUT JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO JUDY WAS DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE THREE LUNG CANCER
MajoraCarter_2010X YEAH AND IT HAS SINCE MOVED TO HER BONES AND HER BRAIN
MajoraCarter_2010X SO BIZARRE THAT SHE'S SUFFERING FROM THE SAME THING THAT SHE TRIED SO HARD TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM BUT HER DREAM OF COAL RIVER MOUNTAIN WIND IS HER LEGACY AND SHE MIGHT NOT
MajoraCarter_2010X GET TO SEE
MajoraCarter_2010X THAT MOUNTAINTOP BUT RATHER THAN WRITING YET SOME KIND OF MANIFESTO OR SOMETHING SHE'S LEAVING BEHIND A BUSINESS PLAN TO MAKE IT HAPPEN THAT'S WHAT MY HOMEGIRL IS DOING SO I'M SO PROUD OF THAT
MajoraCarter_2010X BUT THESE THREE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER BUT THEY DO HAVE AN AWFUL LOT IN COMMON THEY'RE ALL PROBLEM SOLVERS AND THEY'RE JUST SOME OF THE MANY EXAMPLES THAT I REALLY AM PRIVILEGED TO SEE
MajoraCarter_2010X MEET AND LEARN FROM IN THE EXAMPLES OF THE WORK THAT I DO NOW I WAS REALLY LUCKY TO HAVE THEM ALL FEATURED ON MY CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC RADIO
MajoraCarter_2010X AND HOW THE MONEY 'S FLOWING TO MEET THOSE DEMANDS AND WHEN THE CHEAPEST SOLUTIONS INVOLVE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF JOBS YOU'RE LEFT WITH UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE AND THOSE PEOPLE
MajoraCarter_2010X IN FACT THEY MAKE UP SOME OF WHAT I CALL THE MOST EXPENSIVE CITIZENS AND THEY INCLUDE GENERATIONALLY IMPOVERISHED TRAUMATIZED VETS RETURNING FROM THE MIDDLE EAST
MajoraCarter_2010X SO THESE THREE GUYS ALL UNDERSTAND HOW TO PRODUCTIVELY CHANNEL DOLLARS THROUGH OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES TO MEET EXISTING MARKET DEMANDS
MajoraCarter_2010X REDUCE THE SOCIAL PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE NOW AND PREVENT NEW PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER EXAMPLES LIKE THAT ONE PROBLEM
MajoraCarter_2010X THEY LEAVE MUCH TO BE RECYCLED AND WHERE IS THIS WASTE HANDLED USUALLY IN POOR COMMUNITIES AND WE KNOW THAT ECO INDUSTRIAL BUSINESS THESE KINDS OF BUSINESS MODELS THERE'S A MODEL IN EUROPE CALLED THE ECO INDUSTRIAL PARK WHERE YOU EITHER THE WASTE OF ONE COMPANY IS THE RAW MATERIAL FOR ANOTHER
MajoraCarter_2010X OR YOU USE RECYCLED MATERIALS TO MAKE GOODS THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE AND SELL WE CAN CREATE THESE LOCAL MARKETS AND INCENTIVES FOR RECYCLED MATERIALS TO BE USED AS RAW MATERIALS FOR MANUFACTURING
MajoraCarter_2010X AND IN MY HOMETOWN WE ACTUALLY TRIED TO DO ONE OF THESE IN THE BRONX BUT OUR MAYOR DECIDED WHAT HE WANTED TO SEE WAS A JAIL ON THAT SAME SPOT FORTUNATELY BECAUSE WE WANTED TO CREATE HUNDREDS OF JOBS BUT
MajoraCarter_2010X MEGA AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS OFTEN ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR POISONING OUR WATERWAYS AND OUR LAND AND IT PRODUCES THIS INCREDIBLY UNHEALTHY PRODUCT THAT COSTS US BILLIONS IN HEALTH CARE AND LOST PRODUCTIVITY
MajoraCarter_2010X AND SO WE KNOW URBAN AG IS A BIG BUZZ TOPIC THIS TIME OF THE YEAR BUT IT'S MOSTLY GARDENING WHICH HAS SOME
MajoraCarter_2010X VALUE IN COMMUNITY BUILDING LOTS OF IT BUT IT'S NOT IN TERMS OF CREATING JOBS OR FOR FOOD PRODUCTION THE NUMBERS JUST AREN'T THERE
MajoraCarter_2010X PART OF MY WORK NOW IS REALLY LAYING THE GROUNDWORK TO INTEGRATE URBAN AG AND RURAL FOOD SYSTEMS TO HASTEN THE DEMISE OF THE THREE THOUSAND MILE SALAD BY CREATING A NATIONAL BRAND OF URBAN GROWN PRODUCE THAT
MajoraCarter_2010X IN EVERY CITY THAT USES REGIONAL GROWING POWER AND AUGMENTS IT WITH INDOOR GROWING FACILITIES OWNED AND OPERATED BY SMALL GROWERS WHERE NOW THERE ARE ONLY CONSUMERS THIS CAN SUPPORT SEASONAL FARMERS
MajoraCarter_2010X AROUND METRO AREAS WHO ARE LOSING OUT BECAUSE THEY REALLY CAN'T MEET THE YEAR ROUND DEMAND FOR PRODUCE IT'S NOT A COMPETITION WITH RURAL FARM IT'S ACTUALLY
MajoraCarter_2010X SENIOR CENTERS SCHOOLS DAYCARE CENTERS AND PRODUCE A NETWORK OF REGIONAL JOBS AS WELL THIS IS SMART INFRASTRUCTURE
MajoraCarter_2010X AND HOW WE MANAGE OUR BUILT IN ENVIRONMENT AFFECTS THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY OUR MUNICIPALITIES RURAL AND URBAN PLAY THE OPERATIONAL COURSE
MajoraCarter_2010X TO BECOME PART OF THE TAX BASE AND IMAGINE A NATIONAL BUSINESS MODEL THAT CREATES LOCAL JOBS AND SMART INFRASTRUCTURE TO IMPROVE LOCAL ECONOMIC STABILITY
MajoraCarter_2010X SO I'M HOPING YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE THEME HERE THESE EXAMPLES INDICATE A TREND I HAVEN'T CREATED IT AND IT'S NOT HAPPENING BY ACCIDENT
MajoraCarter_2010X I'M NOTICING THAT IT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IT'S GROWING AND WE ALL NEED TO BE INVESTED IN IT IT IS AN ESSENTIAL PILLAR TO THIS COUNTRY 'S RECOVERY
MajoraCarter_2010X I CALL IT HOME SECURITY THE RECESSION HAS US REELING AND FEARFUL AND THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE AIR THESE DAYS THAT IS ALSO VERY EMPOWERING IT'S A REALIZATION THAT WE ARE THE KEY TO OUR OWN RECOVERY
MajoraCarter_2010X NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO ACT IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES WHERE WE THINK LOCAL AND WE ACT LOCAL AND WHEN WE DO THAT OUR NEIGHBORS BE THEY NEXT DOOR OR IN THE NEXT STATE OR IN THE NEXT COUNTRY WILL BE JUST FINE
MajoraCarter_2010X OF THE LOCAL IS THE GLOBAL HOME SECURITY MEANS REBUILDING OUR NATURAL DEFENSES PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK RESTORING OUR NATURAL SYSTEMS
MajoraCarter_2010X WITH THE SAME SOLUTION YIELDS GREAT COST SAVINGS WEALTH GENERATION AND NATIONAL SECURITY MANY GREAT AND INSPIRING SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN GENERATED ACROSS
MajoraCarter_2010X BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THE OLD SAYING CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME I RECENTLY READ A BOOK CALLED LOVE LEADERSHIP BY JOHN HOPE BRYANT AND IT'S ABOUT LEADING IN A WORLD
MajoraCarter_2010X THAT REALLY DOES SEEM TO BE OPERATING ON THE BASIS OF FEAR AND READING THAT BOOK MADE ME REEXAMINE THAT THEORY BECAUSE I NEED TO EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN BY THAT SEE MY DAD
MajoraCarter_2010X WAS A GREAT GREAT MAN IN MANY WAYS HE GREW UP IN THE SEGREGATED SOUTH ESCAPED LYNCHING AND ALL THAT DURING SOME REALLY HARD TIMES AND HE PROVIDED A REALLY STABLE HOME
MajoraCarter_2010X FOR ME AND MY SIBLINGS AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT FELL ON HARD TIMES BUT LIKE ALL OF US HE HAD SOME PROBLEMS AND
MajoraCarter_2010X HIS WAS GAMBLING COMPULSIVELY TO HIM THAT PHRASE CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME MEANT THAT MY PAYDAY
MajoraCarter_2010X OR SOMEONE ELSE'S WOULD JUST HAPPEN TO COINCIDE WITH HIS LUCKY DAY SO YOU NEED TO HELP HIM OUT AND SOMETIMES I WOULD LOAN HIM MONEY FROM MY AFTER SCHOOL OR
MajoraCarter_2010X SUMMER JOBS AND HE ALWAYS HAD THE GREAT INTENTION OF PAYING ME BACK WITH INTEREST OF COURSE AFTER HE HIT IT BIG
MajoraCarter_2010X SO I'M NOT THAT UNHAPPY ABOUT THAT BUT LISTEN I DID FEEL OBLIGATED TO HIM AND I GREW UP
MajoraCarter_2010X THEN I GREW UP AND I'M A GROWN WOMAN NOW AND I HAVE LEARNED A FEW THINGS ALONG THE WAY TO ME CHARITY OFTEN IS JUST ABOUT GIVING BECAUSE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
MajoraCarter_2010X OR BECAUSE IT'S WHAT YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE OR IT'S ABOUT GIVING UNTIL IT HURTS I'M ABOUT PROVIDING THE MEANS TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT WILL GROW AND INTENSIFY ITS ORIGINAL INVESTMENT
MajoraCarter_2010X AND NOT JUST REQUIRE GREATER GIVING NEXT YEAR I'M NOT TRYING TO FEED THE HABIT I SPENT SOME YEARS WATCHING HOW GOOD INTENTIONS FOR COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TO SUPPORT
MajoraCarter_2010X THE COMMUNITY AND EMPOWER IT ACTUALLY LEFT PEOPLE IN THE SAME IF NOT WORSE POSITION THAN THEY WERE IN BEFORE AND OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS WE'VE SPENT RECORD AMOUNTS PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS ON SOCIAL PROBLEMS YET
MajoraCarter_2010X AND I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THESE ISSUES BECAUSE FOR MANY YEARS I SPENT A LONG TIME IN THE NON PROFIT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX AND I'M A RECOVERING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TWO YEARS CLEAN
MajoraCarter_2010X BUT DURING THAT TIME I REALIZED THAT IT WAS ABOUT
MajoraCarter_2010X THE GREATER OUR SUCCESS THE LESS MONEY CAME IN FROM FOUNDATIONS AND I TELL YOU BEING ON THE TED STAGE AND WINNING A MACARTHUR IN THE SAME EXACT YEAR
MajoraCarter_2010X GAVE EVERYONE THE IMPRESSION THAT I HAD ARRIVED AND BY THE TIME I'D MOVED ON I WAS ACTUALLY COVERING A THIRD OF MY AGENCY 'S BUDGET
MajoraCarter_2010X DEFICIT WITH SPEAKING FEES AND I THINK BECAUSE EARLY ON FRANKLY MY PROGRAMS WERE JUST A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF THEIR TIME BUT SINCE THEN THE PARK THAT WAS JUST A DUMP AND WAS FEATURED AT A TED TWO THOUSAND AND SIX TALK
MajoraCarter_2010X THIS LITTLE THING BUT I DID IN FACT GET MARRIED IN IT OVER HERE THERE GOES MY DOG WHO LED ME TO THE PARK IN MY WEDDING
MajoraCarter_2010X THE SOUTH BRONX GREENWAY WAS ALSO JUST A DRAWING ON THE STAGE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX SINCE THEN WE GOT ABOUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN STIMULUS PACKAGE MONEY TO COME AND GET HERE AND WE LOVE THIS BECAUSE I LOVE CONSTRUCTION NOW BECAUSE WE'RE WATCHING THESE THINGS ACTUALLY
MajoraCarter_2010X SO I WANT EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF SHIFTING CHARITY INTO ENTERPRISE I STARTED MY FIRM TO HELP COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY REALIZE THEIR OWN POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE EVERYTHING
MajoraCarter_2010X ABOUT THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THEIR PEOPLE HOME SECURITY IS NEXT ON MY TO DO LIST WHAT WE NEED ARE PEOPLE WHO SEE THE VALUE IN INVESTING IN THESE TYPES OF LOCAL ENTERPRISES WHO WILL PARTNER WITH FOLKS LIKE ME TO IDENTIFY
MajoraCarter_2010X THE GROWTH TRENDS AND CLIMATE ADAPTATION AS WELL AS UNDERSTAND THE GROWING SOCIAL COSTS OF BUSINESS AS USUAL WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO EMBRACE AND REPAIR OUR LAND
MajoraCarter_2010X REPAIR OUR POWER SYSTEMS AND REPAIR OURSELVES IT'S TIME TO STOP BUILDING THE SHOPPING MALLS THE PRISONS
MajoraCarter_2010X THE STADIUMS AND OTHER TRIBUTES TO ALL OF OUR COLLECTIVE FAILURES IT IS TIME THAT WE START BUILDING LIVING MONUMENTS TO HOPE AND POSSIBILITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
