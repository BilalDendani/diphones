DamonHorowitz_2011@53.77:62.09 SO WHEN WE MEET IN MY PHILOSOPHY CLASS IN HIS PRISON AND I SAY IN THIS CLASS WE WILL DISCUSS THE FOUNDATIONS OF ETHICS TONY INTERRUPTS ME

DamonHorowitz_2011@81.64:85.06 SO I SAY TO TONY SORRY
DamonHorowitz_2011@85.64:89.47 BUT IT 'S WORSE THAN YOU THINK YOU THINK YOU KNOW RIGHT AND WRONG

DamonHorowitz_2011@127.57:130.73 WHAT TONY SEES IN THAT MOMENT IS THE PROJECT OF PHILOSOPHY
DamonHorowitz_2011@130.73:139.53 THE PROJECT THAT BEGINS IN WONDER WHAT KANT CALLED ADMIRATION AND AWE AT THE STARRY SKY ABOVE AND THE MORAL LAW WITHIN WHAT CAN CREATURES LIKE US KNOW OF SUCH THINGS
DamonHorowitz_2011@139.53:155.71 IT IS THE PROJECT THAT ALWAYS TAKES US BACK TO THE CONDITION OF EXISTENCE WHAT HEIDEGGER CALLED THE ALWAYS ALREADY THERE IT IS THE PROJECT OF QUESTIONING WHAT WE BELIEVE AND WHY WE BELIEVE IT WHAT SOCRATES CALLED THE EXAMINED LIFE SOCRATES A MAN WISE ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT HE KNOWS NOTHING SOCRATES DIED IN PRISON

DamonHorowitz_2011@168.87:179.72 FREE TONY LEARNS ABOUT THE ONTOLOGICALLY PROMISCUOUS THE EPISTEMOLOGICALLY ANXIOUS THE ETHICALLY DUBIOUS THE METAPHYSICALLY RIDICULOUS THAT 'S PLATO DESCARTES NIETZSCHE AND BILL CLINTON
DamonHorowitz_2011@179.72:193.9 SO WHEN HE GIVES ME HIS FINAL PAPER IN WHICH HE ARGUES THAT THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE IS PERHAPS TOO UNCOMPROMISING TO DEAL WITH THE CONFLICT THAT AFFECTS OUR EVERYDAY AND CHALLENGES ME TO TELL HIM WHETHER THEREFORE WE ARE CONDEMNED TO MORAL FAILURE I SAY
DamonHorowitz_2011@193.9:210.27 I DON 'T KNOW LET US THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IN THAT MOMENT THERE 'S NO MARK BY TONY 'S NAME IT 'S JUST THE TWO OF US STANDING THERE IT IS NOT PROFESSOR AND CONVICT IT IS JUST TWO MINDS READY TO DO PHILOSOPHY AND I SAY TO TONY LET 'S DO THIS
