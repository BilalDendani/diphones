LaurieGarrett_2007U@12.56:12.70 SO
LaurieGarrett_2007U@12.77:27.45 THE FIRST QUESTION IS WHY DO WE NEED TO EVEN WORRY ABOUT A PANDEMIC THREAT WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN I SAY WE I'M AT THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS WE'RE CONCERNED IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNITY AND OF COURSE IN THE BIOLOGY COMMUNITY AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY
LaurieGarrett_2007U@44.26:54.95 THAT HAS CHANGED THE RISK EQUATION KATRINA SHOWED US THAT WE CAN NOT COMPLETELY DEPEND ON GOVERNMENT TO HAVE READINESS IN HAND TO BE CAPABLE OF HANDLING THINGS INDEED AN OUTBREAK WOULD BE MULTIPLE
LaurieGarrett_2007U@67.28:78.05 AT THE END OF LAST CHRISTMAS ONLY THIRTEEN COUNTRIES HAD SEEN H FIVE N ONE BUT WE'RE NOW UP TO FIFTY FIVE COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD HAVE HAD THIS VIRUS EMERGE IN EITHER BIRDS OR PEOPLE OR BOTH
LaurieGarrett_2007U@78.51:88.84 IN THE BIRD OUTBREAKS WE NOW CAN SEE THAT PRETTY MUCH THE WHOLE WORLD HAS SEEN THIS VIRUS EXCEPT THE AMERICAS AND I'LL GET INTO WHY WE'VE SO FAR BEEN SPARED IN A MOMENT
LaurieGarrett_2007U@93.71:99.33 ONE OF THE MOST LETHAL THINGS WE'VE SEEN IN CIRCULATION IN THE WORLD IN ANY RECENT CENTURIES
LaurieGarrett_2007U@99.71:107.59 AND WE'VE DEALT WITH IT BY KILLING OFF LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF CHICKENS AND UNFORTUNATELY OFTEN NOT REIMBURSING THE PEASANT FARMERS WITH THE RESULT THAT THERE'S COVER UP
LaurieGarrett_2007U@107.89:116.21 IT'S ALSO CARRIED ON MIGRATION PATTERNS OF WILD MIGRATORY AQUATIC BIRDS THERE HAS BEEN THIS CENTRALIZED EVENT IN A PLACE CALLED LAKE CHENGHAI CHINA
LaurieGarrett_2007U@116.46:124.08 TWO YEARS AGO THE MIGRATING BIRDS HAD A MULTIPLE EVENT WHERE THOUSANDS DIED BECAUSE OF A MUTATION OCCURRING IN THE VIRUS
LaurieGarrett_2007U@124.35:133.66 WHICH MADE THE SPECIES RANGE BROADEN DRAMATICALLY SO THAT BIRDS GOING TO SIBERIA TO EUROPE AND TO AFRICA CARRIED THE VIRUS WHICH HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN POSSIBLE
LaurieGarrett_2007U@133.90:143.74 WE'RE NOW SEEING OUTBREAKS IN HUMAN POPULATIONS SO FAR FORTUNATELY SMALL EVENTS TINY OUTBREAKS OCCASIONAL CLUSTERS
LaurieGarrett_2007U@144.01:155.31 THE VIRUS HAS MUTATED DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS TO FORM TWO DISTINCT FAMILIES IF YOU WILL OF THE H FIVE N ONE VIRAL TREE WITH BRANCHES IN THEM AND WITH DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES THAT ARE WORRYING
LaurieGarrett_2007U@175.65:182.41 SO ONE THOUGHT IS AFTER NINE ELEVEN WHEN THE AIRPORTS CLOSED OUR FLU SEASON WAS DELAYED BY TWO WEEKS SO THE THOUGHT IS
LaurieGarrett_2007U@182.70:191.53 HEY MAYBE WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS JUST IMMEDIATELY WE HEAR THERE IS H FIVE N ONE SPREADING FROM HUMAN TO HUMAN THE VIRUS HAS MUTATED TO BE A HUMAN TO HUMAN TRANSMITTER LET 'S SHUT DOWN THE AIRPORTS
LaurieGarrett_2007U@192.03:199.78 HOWEVER HUGE SUPERCOMPUTER ANALYSES DONE OF THE LIKELY EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS SHOW THAT IT WON 'T BUY US MUCH TIME AT ALL
LaurieGarrett_2007U@200.14:209.18 AND OF COURSE IT WILL BE HUGELY DISRUPTIVE IN PREPARATION PLANS FOR EXAMPLE ALL MASKS ARE MADE IN CHINA HOW DO YOU GET THEM MOBILIZED AROUND THE WORLD IF YOU'VE SHUT ALL THE
LaurieGarrett_2007U@210.40:219.51 HOW DO YOU GET THE VACCINES MOVED AROUND THE WORLD AND THE DRUGS MOVED AND WHATEVER MAY OR NOT BE AVAILABLE THAT WOULD WORK SO IT TURNS OUT THAT SHUTTING DOWN THE AIRPORTS IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
LaurieGarrett_2007U@219.88:234.10 WE'RE WORRIED BECAUSE THIS VIRUS UNLIKE ANY OTHER FLU WE'VE EVER STUDIED CAN BE TRANSMITTED BY EATING RAW MEAT OF THE INFECTED ANIMALS WE'VE SEEN TRANSMISSION TO WILD CATS AND DOMESTIC CATS AND NOW ALSO DOMESTIC PET DOGS
LaurieGarrett_2007U@234.68:244.94 AND IN EXPERIMENTAL FEEDINGS TO RODENTS AND FERRETS WE FOUND THAT THE ANIMALS EXHIBIT SYMPTOMS NEVER SEEN WITH FLU SEIZURES CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS PARTIAL PARALYSIS
LaurieGarrett_2007U@258.01:271.81 AND THIS UNBELIEVABLE MORTALITY RATE IN HUMAN BEINGS FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BECOME INFECTED WITH H FIVE N ONE HAVE IN FACT SUCCUMBED AND WE DON'T HAVE A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO GOT INFECTED AND NEVER DEVELOPED DISEASE
LaurieGarrett_2007U@272.20:282.61 IN EXPERIMENTAL FEEDING IN MONKEYS YOU CAN SEE THAT IT ACTUALLY DOWNREGULATES A SPECIFIC IMMUNE SYSTEM MODULATOR THE RESULT IS THAT WHAT KILLS YOU IS NOT THE VIRUS DIRECTLY BUT YOUR OWN IMMUNE SYSTEM
LaurieGarrett_2007U@293.17:303.48 WE HAVE SEEN HUMAN TO HUMAN TRANSMISSION IN AT LEAST THREE CLUSTERS FORTUNATELY INVOLVING VERY INTIMATE CONTACT STILL NOT PUTTING THE WORLD AT LARGE AT ANY KIND OF RISK
LaurieGarrett_2007U@330.20:341.52 HALF THE STATES WOULD RUN OUT OF HOSPITAL BEDS IN THE FIRST WEEK MAYBE TWO WEEKS AND FORTY STATES ALREADY HAVE AN ACUTE NURSING SHORTAGE ADD ON PANDEMIC THREAT YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE SO WHAT HAVE PEOPLE BEEN DOING WITH THIS MONEY
LaurieGarrett_2007U@342.15:350.12 EXERCISES DRILLS ALL OVER THE WORLD LET 'S PRETEND THERE'S A PANDEMIC LET 'S EVERYBODY RUN AROUND AND PLAY YOUR ROLE MAIN RESULT IS THAT THERE IS TREMENDOUS CONFUSION
LaurieGarrett_2007U@373.61:384.71 THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THE FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY WILL BASICALLY BE ABOUT TRYING TO KEEP THE VIRUS OUT WHICH WE ALL KNOW IS IMPOSSIBLE AND THEN TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT PRIMARILY ON OUR ECONOMY
LaurieGarrett_2007U@385.23:396.20 THE REST IS UP TO YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY EVERYTHING IS ABOUT YOUR TOWN WHERE YOU LIVE WELL HOW GOOD IS THE CITY COUNCIL YOU HAVE HOW GOOD A MAYOR YOU HAVE THAT'S WHO 'S GOING TO BE IN CHARGE
LaurieGarrett_2007U@396.68:405.30 MOST LOCAL FACILITIES WOULD ALL BE COMPETING TO TRY AND GET THEIR HANDS ON THEIR PIECE OF THE FEDERAL STOCKPILE OF A DRUG CALLED TAMIFLU WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE HELPFUL I'LL GET INTO THAT
LaurieGarrett_2007U@405.63:413.72 OF AVAILABLE VACCINES AND ANY OTHER TREATMENTS AND MASKS AND ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN STOCKPILED AND YOU'LL HAVE MASSIVE COMPETITION
LaurieGarrett_2007U@414.17:426.89 NOW WE DID PURCHASE A VACCINE YOU'VE PROBABLY ALL HEARD ABOUT IT MADE BY SANOFI AVENTIS UNFORTUNATELY IT'S MADE AGAINST THE CURRENT FORM OF H FIVE N ONE WE KNOW THE VIRUS WILL MUTATE IT WILL BE A DIFFERENT VIRUS THE VACCINE WILL PROBABLY BE USELESS
LaurieGarrett_2007U@427.50:437.67 SO HERE 'S WHERE THE DECISIONS COME IN YOU'RE THE MAYOR OF YOUR LOCAL TOWN LET 'S SEE SHOULD WE ORDER THAT ALL PETS BE KEPT INDOORS GERMANY DID THAT WHEN H FIVE N ONE APPEARED IN GERMANY LAST YEAR
LaurieGarrett_2007U@438.08:443.58 IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE SPREAD BETWEEN HOUSEHOLDS BY HOUSEHOLD CATS DOGS AND SO ON
LaurieGarrett_2007U@444.17:453.65 WHAT DO WE DO WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONTAINMENT ROOMS WITH REVERSE AIR THAT WILL ALLOW THE HEALTHCARE WORKERS TO TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS THESE ARE IN HONG KONG WE HAVE NOTHING LIKE THAT HERE
LaurieGarrett_2007U@475.71:487.11 WELL THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT DID A MODEL OF TELECOMMUTING SIX WEEKS THEY HAD ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY PRETEND A PANDEMIC WAS UNDERWAY WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THE CORE FUNCTIONS YOU KNOW YOU STILL SORT OF HAD
LaurieGarrett_2007U@488.55:500.65 PUT MONEY IN THE ATM MACHINES NOBODY WAS PROCESSING THE CREDIT CARDS YOUR INSURANCE PAYMENTS DIDN'T GO THROUGH AND BASICALLY THE ECONOMY WOULD BE IN A DISASTER STATE OF AFFAIRS AND THAT'S JUST OFFICE WORKERS BANKERS
LaurieGarrett_2007U@509.36:515.81 GREAT DEBATE ABOUT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF FLU TRANSMISSION BETWEEN PEOPLE IS FROM SNEEZING AND COUGHING AND WHAT PERCENTAGE IS ON
LaurieGarrett_2007U@517.14:526.25 THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE TRIED TO LOOK AT THE MASKING QUESTION CAN WE FIGURE OUT A WAY SINCE WE KNOW WE WON 'T HAVE ENOUGH MASKS BECAUSE WE DON'T MAKE THEM IN AMERICA ANYMORE THEY'RE ALL MADE IN CHINA
LaurieGarrett_2007U@526.59:531.97 WE NEED N NINETY FIVE A STATE OF THE ART TOP OF THE LINE MUST BE FITTED TO YOUR FACE MASK
LaurieGarrett_2007U@532.42:541.40 OR CAN WE GET AWAY WITH SOME DIFFERENT KINDS OF MASKS IN THE SARS EPIDEMIC WE LEARNED IN HONG KONG THAT MOST OF TRANSMISSION WAS BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE REMOVING THEIR MASKS IMPROPERLY
LaurieGarrett_2007U@541.80:552.47 AND THEIR HAND GOT CONTAMINATED WITH THE OUTSIDE OF THE MASK AND THEN THEY RUBBED THEIR NOSE BINGO THEY GOT SARS IT WASN'T FLYING MICROBES IF YOU GO ONLINE RIGHT NOW YOU'LL GET SO MUCH PHONY BALONEY INFORMATION
LaurieGarrett_2007U@552.78:564.93 YOU'LL END UP BUYING THIS IS CALLED AN N NINETY FIVE MASK RIDICULOUS WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A STANDARD FOR WHAT SHOULD BE THE PROTECTIVE GEAR FOR THE FIRST RESPONDERS THE PEOPLE WHO WILL ACTUALLY BE THERE ON THE FRONT LINES
LaurieGarrett_2007U@565.52:571.76 AND TAMIFLU YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD OF THIS DRUG MADE BY HOFFMANN LA ROCHE PATENTED DRUG THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT IT
LaurieGarrett_2007U@573.03:580.56 YOU SOME TIME IN THE MIDST OF AN OUTBREAK SHOULD YOU TAKE TAMIFLU FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME WELL ONE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS IS SUICIDAL IDEATIONS
LaurieGarrett_2007U@590.31:597.43 MAKING MATTERS WORSE AND HERE IS THE OTHER INTERESTING THING WHEN A HUMAN BEING INGESTS TAMIFLU ONLY TWENTY PERCENT IS METABOLIZED APPROPRIATELY
LaurieGarrett_2007U@597.76:606.07 TO BE AN ACTIVE COMPOUND IN THE HUMAN BEING THE REST TURNS INTO A STABLE COMPOUND WHICH SURVIVES FILTRATION INTO THE WATER SYSTEMS
LaurieGarrett_2007U@616.55:628.25 IN BOTH VIETNAM IN PERSON TO PERSON TRANSMISSION AND IN EGYPT IN PERSON TO PERSON TRANSMISSION SO I PERSONALLY THINK THAT OUR LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR TAMIFLU AS AN EFFECTIVE DRUG IS VERY LIMITED
LaurieGarrett_2007U@628.64:639.35 VERY LIMITED INDEED NEVERTHELESS MOST OF THE GOVERNMENTS HAVE BASED THEIR WHOLE FLU POLICIES ON BUILDING STOCKPILES OF TAMIFLU RUSSIA HAS ACTUALLY STOCKPILED ENOUGH FOR NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL RUSSIANS
LaurieGarrett_2007U@671.85:679.17 AND THE BELIEF SYSTEMS WERE WILDLY DISPARATE IN SOME CASES ALL SCHOOLS ALL CHURCHES ALL PUBLIC VENUES WERE CLOSED
LaurieGarrett_2007U@679.66:686.95 THE PANDEMIC CIRCULATED THREE TIMES IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN THE ABSENCE OF COMMERCIAL AIR TRAVEL THE SECOND WAVE WAS THE MUTATED SUPER KILLER
LaurieGarrett_2007U@688.05:695.39 AND IN THE FIRST WAVE WE HAD ENOUGH HEALTHCARE WORKERS BUT BY THE TIME THE SECOND WAVE HIT IT TOOK SUCH A TOLL AMONG THE HEALTHCARE WORKERS
LaurieGarrett_2007U@695.80:708.82 THAT WE LOST MOST OF OUR DOCTORS AND NURSES THAT WERE ON THE FRONT LINES OVERALL WE LOST SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THE VIRUS WAS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT LETHAL TO PREGNANT WOMEN AND WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHY MOST OF THE DEATH TOLL WAS FIFTEEN TO FORTY YEAR
LaurieGarrett_2007U@709.95:720.91 ROBUSTLY HEALTHY YOUNG ADULTS IT WAS LIKENED TO THE PLAGUE WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE DIED THE LOW BALL ESTIMATE IS THIRTY FIVE MILLION THIS WAS BASED ON EUROPEAN AND NORTH AMERICAN DATA
LaurieGarrett_2007U@721.18:730.17 A NEW STUDY BY CHRIS MURRAY AT HARVARD SHOWS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATABASES THAT WERE KEPT BY THE BRITS IN INDIA THERE WAS A THIRTY ONE FOLD GREATER DEATH RATE
LaurieGarrett_2007U@730.53:738.54 AMONG THE INDIANS SO THERE IS A STRONG BELIEF THAT IN PLACES OF POVERTY THE DEATH TOLL WAS FAR HIGHER AND THAT A MORE LIKELY TOLL IS SOMEWHERE
LaurieGarrett_2007U@739.30:746.31 EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE BEFORE WE HAD COMMERCIAL AIR TRAVEL SO ARE WE READY AS A NATION
LaurieGarrett_2007U@746.62:754.32 NO WE'RE NOT AND I THINK EVEN THOSE IN THE LEADERSHIP WOULD SAY THAT IS THE CASE THAT WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR YOU
LaurieGarrett_2007U@754.67:764.68 WELL THE FIRST THING IS I WOULDN'T START BUILDING UP PERSONAL STOCKPILES OF ANYTHING FOR YOURSELF YOUR FAMILY OR YOUR EMPLOYEES UNLESS YOU'VE REALLY DONE YOUR HOMEWORK
LaurieGarrett_2007U@782.85:795.97 WE DON'T KNOW AGAIN WITH TAMIFLU THE NUMBER ONE SIDE EFFECT OF TAMIFLU IS FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS SO THEN HOW CAN YOU TELL WHO IN YOUR FAMILY HAS THE FLU IF EVERYBODY IS TAKING TAMIFLU
LaurieGarrett_2007U@796.72:806.13 YOU EXPAND THAT OUT TO THINK OF A WHOLE COMMUNITY OR ALL YOUR EMPLOYEES IN YOUR COMPANY YOU BEGIN TO REALIZE HOW LIMITED THE TAMIFLU OPTION MIGHT BE
LaurieGarrett_2007U@818.90:827.89 YOU WANT TO VIEW THE PANDEMIC THREAT THEY WAY BACK IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES PEOPLE VIEWED THE CIVIL DEFENSE ISSUE AND BUILD YOUR OWN LITTLE BOMB SHELTER FOR PANDEMIC FLU
LaurieGarrett_2007U@828.27:838.70 I DON'T THINK THAT'S RATIONAL I THINK IT'S ABOUT HAVING TO BE PREPARED AS COMMUNITIES NOT AS INDIVIDUALS BEING PREPARED AS NATION BEING PREPARED AS STATE BEING PREPARED AS TOWN
LaurieGarrett_2007U@838.98:849.73 AND RIGHT NOW MOST OF THE PREPAREDNESS IS DEEPLY FLAWED AND I HOPE I'VE CONVINCED YOU OF THAT WHICH MEANS THAT THE REAL JOB IS GO OUT AND SAY TO YOUR LOCAL LEADERS AND YOUR NATIONAL LEADERS
LaurieGarrett_2007U@850.39:861.90 WHY HAVEN'T YOU SOLVED THESE PROBLEMS WHY ARE YOU STILL THINKING THAT THE LESSONS OF KATRINA DO NOT APPLY TO FLU AND PUT THE PRESSURE WHERE THE PRESSURE NEEDS TO BE PUT BUT
LaurieGarrett_2007U@862.22:874.50 I GUESS THE OTHER THING TO ADD IS IF YOU DO HAVE EMPLOYEES AND YOU DO HAVE A COMPANY I THINK YOU HAVE CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES TO DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU ARE THINKING AHEAD FOR THEM AND YOU ARE TRYING TO PLAN AT A MINIMUM THE
LaurieGarrett_2007U@889.95:900.18 CAN YOU SUSTAIN YOUR COMPANY THAT WAY IF YOU HAVE A DOT COM MAYBE YOU CAN OTHERWISE YOU'RE IN TROUBLE HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS
LaurieGarrett_2007U@909.48:913.32 WHAT FACTORS DETERMINE THE DURATION OF A PANDEMIC WE DON'T REALLY KNOW I
LaurieGarrett_2007U@938.65:938.82 YOU
LaurieGarrett_2007U@943.11:943.40 THIS
LaurieGarrett_2007U@945.24:958.83 THE MOMENT THAT YOU SEE ANY EVIDENCE OF SERIOUS HUMAN TO HUMAN TO TRANSMISSION NOT JUST INTIMATELY BETWEEN FAMILY MEMBERS WHO TOOK CARE OF AN AILING SISTER OR BROTHER BUT A COMMUNITY INFECTED
LaurieGarrett_2007U@959.42:969.92 SPREAD WITHIN A SCHOOL SPREAD WITHIN A DORMITORY SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE THEN I THINK THAT THERE IS UNIVERSAL AGREEMENT NOW AT WHO ALL THE WAY DOWN SEND OUT THE ALERT
LaurieGarrett_2007U@974.08:975.43 SOME RESEARCH HAS INDICATED THAT
LaurieGarrett_2007U@985.99:995.03 YOUR VULNERABILITY TO INFLUENZA BUT WE DO NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHY THE MECHANISM ISN'T CLEAR AND
LaurieGarrett_2007U@997.06:1005.32 I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS ANY WAY RESPONSIBLY FOR SOMEONE TO START MEDICATING THEIR CHILDREN WITH THEIR
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1022.43:1033.41 RIGHT SO I HAVE FOR A LONG TIME SAID THAT WHAT WE REALLY NEEDED WAS A RAPID DIAGNOSTIC AND OUR CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL HAS LABELED
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1033.93:1048.31 TEST THEY DEVELOPED A RAPID DIAGNOSTIC IT TAKES TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN A VERY HIGHLY DEVELOPED LABORATORY IN HIGHLY SKILLED HANDS I'M THINKING DIPSTICK YOU COULD DO IT TO YOUR OWN KID IT CHANGES COLOR IT TELLS YOU IF YOU HAVE H FIVE N ONE
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1048.91:1056.21 IN TERMS OF WHERE WE ARE IN SCIENCE WITH DNA IDENTIFICATION CAPACITIES AND SO ON
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1056.88:1062.06 IT'S NOT THAT FAR OFF WE'RE NOT THERE AND THERE HASN'T BEEN THE KIND OF INVESTMENT TO GET US
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1078.59:1080.06 PRETTY SEVERE
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1093.53:1102.48 IT'S CURIOUS THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF MASS DIE OFFS OF CHICKENS OR HOUSEHOLD BIRDS ACROSS AMERICA BEFORE THE HUMAN PANDEMIC HAPPENED
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1103.01:1114.57 THAT MAY BE BECAUSE THOSE EVENTS WERE OCCURRING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD WHERE NOBODY WAS PAYING ATTENTION BUT THE VIRUS CLEARLY WENT THROUGH ONE ROUND AROUND THE WORLD
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1115.10:1122.69 IN A MILD ENOUGH FORM THAT THE BRITISH ARMY IN WORLD WAR I ACTUALLY CERTIFIED THAT IT WAS NOT A THREAT AND WOULD NOT
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1123.01:1131.11 AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE WAR AND AFTER CIRCULATING AROUND THE WORLD CAME BACK IN A FORM THAT WAS TREMENDOUSLY LETHAL
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1132.69:1142.73 WHAT PERCENTAGE OF INFECTED PEOPLE WERE KILLED BY IT AGAIN WE DON'T REALLY KNOW FOR SURE IT'S CLEAR THAT IF YOU WERE MALNOURISHED TO BEGIN WITH YOU HAD A WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEM
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1143.20:1150.20 LIVED IN POVERTY IN INDIA OR AFRICA YOUR LIKELIHOOD OF DYING WAS FAR GREATER BUT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1151.51:1161.69 THE THINGS I'VE HEARD IS THAT THE REAL DEATH CAUSE WHEN YOU GET A FLU IS THE ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA AND THAT A PNEUMONIA VACCINE MAY OFFER YOU FIFTY PERCENT BETTER CHANCE OF SURVIVAL
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1162.47:1169.89 FOR A LONG TIME RESEARCHERS IN EMERGING DISEASES WERE KIND OF DISMISSIVE OF THE PANDEMIC FLU THREAT ON THE GROUNDS THAT
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1182.05:1192.51 AND THEY DIE NOT OF THE FLU BUT BECAUSE THE FLU GIVES AN ASSAULT TO THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM AND ALONG COMES PNEUMOCOCCUS OR ANOTHER BACTERIA STREPTOCOCCUS AND BOOM THEY GET A BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1202.31:1210.69 IT'S THIS ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL DISRUPTION OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM THAT IS THE KEY TO WHY PEOPLE DIE OF THIS VIRUS
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1211.12:1219.70 AND I WOULD JUST ADD WE SAW THE SAME THING WITH SARS SO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS YOUR BODY SAYS YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM SENDS OUT ALL ITS
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1232.06:1240.68 DO ANY GOOD TO BRING IN THE TANKS AND THE ARTILLERY BECAUSE THOSE T CELLS DON'T RECOGNIZE IT EITHER SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO ALL OUT THERMONUCLEAR RESPONSE
LaurieGarrett_2007U@1255.21:1257.80 AND I THINK MY TIME IS UP I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR
