JulieTaymor_2011@106.95:109.17 WHICH IS A SEMINAL MOMENT IN MY LIFE
JulieTaymor_2011@116:130.94 AND WHEN I 'M IN THE TURBULENT TIMES AS WE KNOW THAT I AM RIGHT NOW THROUGH THE CRUCIBLE AND THE FIRE OF TRANSFORMATION WHICH IS WHAT ALL OF YOU DO ACTUALLY ANYBODY WHO CREATES KNOWS THERE 'S THAT POINT WHERE IT HASN 'T QUITE
JulieTaymor_2011@131.03:134.72 BECOME THE PHOENIX OR THE BURNT CHAR
JulieTaymor_2011@143.94:153.6 TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YEARS A LONG TIME AGO ON A FELLOWSHIP AND I FOUND MYSELF AFTER TWO YEARS THERE AND PERFORMING AND LEARNING ON THE ISLAND OF BALI
JulieTaymor_2011@163.34:167.39 A RITE OF PASSAGE LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT IT WAS MINE AS WELL
JulieTaymor_2011@173.14:177.7 IN THE DARK THERE WAS NO ELECTRICITY JUST THE FULL MOON
JulieTaymor_2011@178.22:179.99 DOWN IN THIS EMPTY SQUARE
JulieTaymor_2011@191.53:194.93 AND I THOUGHT I WAS ALONE IN THE DARK UNDER THIS TREE
JulieTaymor_2011@204.13:207.2 AND THESE TWENTY OLD MEN WHO I 'D SEEN BEFORE
JulieTaymor_2011@207.56:209.61 ALL OF A SUDDEN STOOD UP
JulieTaymor_2011@209.9:211.85 IN THESE FULL WARRIOR
JulieTaymor_2011@211.85:224.18 COSTUMES WITH THE HEADDRESS AND THE SPEARS AND NO ONE WAS IN THE SQUARE AND I WAS HIDDEN IN THE SHADOWS NO ONE WAS THERE AND THEY CAME OUT AND THEY DID THIS INCREDIBLE DANCE
JulieTaymor_2011@229.03:238.61 AND THEY MOVED THEIR BODIES AND THEY CAME FORWARD AND THE LIGHTS BOUNCED OFF THESE COSTUMES AND I 'VE BEEN IN THEATER SINCE I WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD
JulieTaymor_2011@248.31:252.04 AND I REALIZED THAT THEY WERE PERFORMING FOR GOD
JulieTaymor_2011@252.94:254.59 WHATEVER THAT MEANS
JulieTaymor_2011@255.33:256.96 BUT SOMEHOW
JulieTaymor_2011@257.03:259.11 IT DIDN 'T MATTER ABOUT THE PUBLICITY
JulieTaymor_2011@276.51:282.52 A YOUNG MAN WITH A PROPANE LANTERN CAME ON HUNG IT UP ON A TREE SET UP A CURTAIN THE VILLAGE SQUARE WAS
JulieTaymor_2011@282.52:287.38 FILLED WITH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE AND THEY PUT ON AN OPERA ALL NIGHT LONG
JulieTaymor_2011@287.38:289.02 HUMAN BEINGS NEEDED THE LIGHT
JulieTaymor_2011@289.72:291.68 THEY NEEDED THE LIGHT TO SEE
JulieTaymor_2011@298.76:301.02 WAS THAT YOU MUST BE TRUE
JulieTaymor_2011@301.94:306 TO WHAT YOU BELIEVE AS AN ARTIST ALL THE WAY THROUGH
JulieTaymor_2011@306.03:307.71 BUT YOU ALSO
JulieTaymor_2011@308.23:316.57 HAVE TO BE AWARE THAT THE AUDIENCE IS OUT THERE IN OUR LIVES AT THIS TIME AND THEY ALSO NEED THE LIGHT AND IT 'S THIS INCREDIBLE BALANCE
JulieTaymor_2011@334.7:338.26 WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO NOW IS TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT
JulieTaymor_2011@339.19:345.73 ABOUT HOW I WORK LET 'S TAKE THE LION KING YOU SAW MANY EXAMPLES OF MY WORK UP THERE BUT IT 'S ONE THAT PEOPLE KNOW
JulieTaymor_2011@345.77:348.41 I START WITH THE NOTION OF THE IDEOGRAPH
JulieTaymor_2011@355.71:361.94 I GO TO THE CONCEPT OF THE LION KING AND I SAY WHAT IS THE ESSENCE OF IT WHAT IS THE ABSTRACTION
JulieTaymor_2011@361.98:367.44 IF I WERE TO REDUCE THIS ENTIRE STORY INTO ONE IMAGE WHAT WOULD IT BE
JulieTaymor_2011@369.02:372.19 THE CIRCLE THE CIRCLE IT 'S SO OBVIOUS THE CIRCLE OF LIFE
JulieTaymor_2011@372.29:374.6 THE CIRCLE OF MUFASA 'S MASK
JulieTaymor_2011@374.9:382.38 THE CIRCLE THAT WHEN WE COME TO ACT II AND THERE 'S A DROUGHT HOW DO YOU EXPRESS DROUGHT IT 'S A CIRCLE OF SILK
JulieTaymor_2011@387.84:390.89 THE CIRCLE OF LIFE COMES IN THE WHEELS
JulieTaymor_2011@390.89:392.64 OF THE GAZELLES THAT LEAP
JulieTaymor_2011@392.97:409.33 AND YOU SEE THE MECHANICS AND BEING A THEATER PERSON WHAT I KNOW AND LOVE ABOUT THE THEATER IS THAT WHEN THE AUDIENCE COMES IN AND THEY SUSPEND THEIR DISBELIEF WHEN YOU SEE MEN WALKING OR WOMEN WALKING WITH A PLATTER OF GRASS ON THEIR HEADS YOU KNOW IT 'S THE SAVANNA YOU DON 'T QUESTION THAT
JulieTaymor_2011@409.51:418.44 I LOVE THE APPARENT TRUTH OF THEATER I LOVE THAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO FILL IN THE BLANKS THE AUDIENCE IS WILLING TO SAY OH
JulieTaymor_2011@418.45:420.58 I KNOW THAT 'S NOT A REAL SUN
JulieTaymor_2011@420.73:435.88 YOU TOOK PIECES OF STICKS YOU ADDED SILK TO THE BOTTOM YOU SUSPENDED THESE PIECES YOU LET IT FALL FLAT ON THE FLOOR AND AS IT RISES WITH THE STRINGS I SEE THAT IT 'S A SUN BUT THE BEAUTY OF IT IS THAT IT 'S JUST SILK
JulieTaymor_2011@436.26:438.99 AND STICKS AND IN A WAY
JulieTaymor_2011@439.33:442.01 THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT SPIRITUAL
JulieTaymor_2011@442.13:449.36 THAT 'S WHAT MOVES YOU IT 'S NOT THE ACTUAL LITERAL SUNRISE THAT 'S COMING IT 'S THE ART OF IT
JulieTaymor_2011@453.37:456.83 THE STORY IS CRITICAL AND THE BOOK AND THE LANGUAGE
JulieTaymor_2011@461.67:463.7 THE MECHANICS THE METHODS
JulieTaymor_2011@463.8:466.96 THAT YOU USE IS EQUAL TO THE STORY ITSELF
JulieTaymor_2011@467.41:470.6 AND I 'M ONE WHO LOVES HIGH TECH AND LOW TECH
JulieTaymor_2011@470.72:472.51 SO I COULD GO FROM
JulieTaymor_2011@472.58:477.83 FOR INSTANCE I 'LL SHOW YOU SOME SPIDER MAN LATER THESE INCREDIBLE MACHINES THAT MOVE PEOPLE ALONG
JulieTaymor_2011@484.69:487.48 SO NOW I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
JulieTaymor_2011@487.92:491.91 SOME CLIPS FROM THE OTHER BIG PROJECT OF MY LIFE THIS YEAR
JulieTaymor_2011@628.9:634.36 FROM THEATER DOING THE TEMPEST ON THE STAGE IN A VERY LOW BUDGET PRODUCTION MANY YEARS AGO
JulieTaymor_2011@634.52:638.76 AND I LOVE THE PLAY AND I ALSO THINK IT 'S SHAKESPEARE 'S LAST PLAY
JulieTaymor_2011@638.93:642.55 AND IT REALLY LENDS ITSELF AS YOU CAN SEE TO CINEMA
JulieTaymor_2011@642.84:647.02 BUT I 'M JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE EXAMPLE ABOUT HOW ONE STAGES IT IN THEATER
JulieTaymor_2011@647.08:649.53 AND THEN HOW ONE TAKES THAT SAME
JulieTaymor_2011@649.87:652.9 IDEA OR STORY AND MOVES IT INTO CINEMA
JulieTaymor_2011@654.75:659.1 THE IDEOGRAPH THAT I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT BEFORE WHAT IS IT FOR THE TEMPEST
JulieTaymor_2011@664.81:667.1 HANG MY HAT ON FOR THIS
JulieTaymor_2011@667.1:668.8 AND IT WAS THE SAND CASTLE
JulieTaymor_2011@668.84:672.12 THE IDEA OF NURTURE VERSUS NATURE
JulieTaymor_2011@672.2:679.74 THAT WE BUILD THESE CIVILIZATIONS SHE SPEAKS ABOUT IT AT THE END HELEN MIRREN 'S PROSPERA WE BUILD THEM BUT
JulieTaymor_2011@680.23:683.37 UNDER NATURE UNDER THE GRAND TEMPEST
JulieTaymor_2011@683.4:687.93 THESE CLOUD CAPPED TOWERS THESE GORGEOUS PALACES WILL FADE
JulieTaymor_2011@688.95:692.41 AND THERE WILL LEAVE NOT A RACK BEHIND
JulieTaymor_2011@692.8:697.24 SO IN THE THEATER I STARTED THE PLAY IT WAS A BLACK SAND RAKE
JulieTaymor_2011@697.34:703.99 WHITE CYC AND THERE WAS A LITTLE GIRL MIRANDA ON THE HORIZON BUILDING A DRIP CASTLE A SAND CASTLE
JulieTaymor_2011@704.29:707.75 AND AS SHE WAS THERE ON THE EDGE OF THAT STAGE
JulieTaymor_2011@713.42:715.03 RAN ALONG THE TOP
JulieTaymor_2011@715.81:719.51 AND STARTED TO POUR WATER ON THE SAND CASTLE
JulieTaymor_2011@719.91:722.75 AND THE SAND CASTLE STARTED TO DRIP AND SINK
JulieTaymor_2011@722.82:726.12 BUT BEFORE IT DID THE AUDIENCE SAW
JulieTaymor_2011@726.7:735.84 THE BLACK CLAD STAGEHANDS THE MEDIUM WAS APPARENT IT WAS BANAL WE SAW IT BUT AS THEY STARTED TO POUR THE WATER
JulieTaymor_2011@736.16:745.95 THE LIGHT CHANGED FROM SHOWING YOU THE BLACK CLAD STAGEHANDS TO FOCUSING THIS ROUGH MAGIC THAT WE DO IN THEATER IT FOCUSED RIGHT ON THE WATER ITSELF
JulieTaymor_2011@746.39:750.06 AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE AUDIENCE 'S PERSPECTIVE CHANGES
JulieTaymor_2011@751:756.69 IT BECOMES SOMETHING MAGICALLY LARGE IT BECOMES THE RAINSTORM
JulieTaymor_2011@768.4:774.94 NOW THE DIFFERENCE WHEN I WENT AND DID IT IN THE CINEMA I STARTED THE ACTUAL MOVIE
JulieTaymor_2011@775.02:776.95 WITH A CLOSE UP
JulieTaymor_2011@777.21:783.98 OF A SAND CASTLE A BLACK SAND CASTLE AND WHAT CINEMA CAN DO IS BY USING CAMERA
JulieTaymor_2011@797.03:805.14 AND SO I COULD PLAY WITH THE MEDIUM AND WHY I MOVE FROM ONE MEDIUM TO ANOTHER IS TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS NOW I 'M GOING TO TAKE YOU TO SPIDER MAN
JulieTaymor_2011@963.09:971.49 ON THE OTHER SIDE GUNUNG BATUR AND THERE WAS A DEAD VOLCANO NEXT TO THE LIVE VOLCANO I DIDN 'T THINK I 'D BE SWALLOWED BY THE VOLCANO AND I AM HERE
JulieTaymor_2011@971.61:979.06 BUT IT 'S VERY EASY TO CLIMB UP IS IT NOT YOU HOLD ON TO THE ROOTS YOU PUT YOUR FOOT IN THE LITTLE
JulieTaymor_2011@979.22:989.96 ROCKS AND CLIMB UP THERE AND YOU GET TO THE TOP AND I WAS WITH A GOOD FRIEND WHO WAS AN ACTOR AND WE SAID LET 'S GO UP THERE LET 'S SEE IF WE CAN COME CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THAT
JulieTaymor_2011@990.05:1007.34 LIVE VOLCANO AND WE CLIMBED UP AND WE GOT TO THE VERY TOP AND WE 'RE ON THE EDGE ON THIS PRECIPICE ROLAND DISAPPEARS INTO THE SULFUR SMOKE AT THE VOLCANO AT THE OTHER END AND I 'M UP THERE ALONE ON THIS INCREDIBLE PRECIPICE DID YOU HEAR THE LYRICS
JulieTaymor_2011@1007.34:1011.97 I 'M ON THE PRECIPICE LOOKING DOWN INTO A DEAD VOLCANO TO MY LEFT
JulieTaymor_2011@1012.24:1019.69 TO MY RIGHT IS SHEER SHALE IT 'S COMING OFF I 'M IN THONGS AND SARONGS IT WAS MANY YEARS AGO
JulieTaymor_2011@1019.81:1027.55 AND NO HIKING BOOTS AND HE 'S DISAPPEARED THIS MAD FRENCH GYPSY ACTOR OFF IN THE SMOKE
JulieTaymor_2011@1027.57:1029.18 AND I REALIZE I CAN
JulieTaymor_2011@1035.52:1039.87 I THROW AWAY MY THONGS AND I LOOKED AT THE LINE STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
JulieTaymor_2011@1040.53:1043.36 AND I GOT DOWN ON ALL FOURS LIKE A CAT
JulieTaymor_2011@1043.95:1056.62 AND I HELD WITH MY KNEES TO EITHER SIDE OF THIS LINE IN FRONT OF ME FOR THIRTY YARDS OR THIRTY FEET I DON 'T KNOW THE WIND WAS MASSIVELY BLOWING AND THE ONLY WAY
JulieTaymor_2011@1063.14:1066.61 I 'M IN THE CRUCIBLE RIGHT NOW IT 'S MY TRIAL BY FIRE
JulieTaymor_2011@1066.82:1073.33 IT 'S MY COMPANY 'S TRIALS BY FIRE WE SURVIVE BECAUSE OUR THEME SONG IS RISE ABOVE
JulieTaymor_2011@1073.63:1087.63 BOY FALLS FROM THE SKY RISE ABOVE IT 'S RIGHT THERE IN THE PALM OF BOTH OF OUR HANDS OF ALL OF MY COMPANY 'S HANDS I HAVE BEAUTIFUL COLLABORATORS AND WE AS CREATORS ONLY GET THERE ALL TOGETHER I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND
