ArthurGanson_2004 KIND OF AS A WAY OF SURVIVING I WOULD GO INTO MY OWN VERY PERSONAL SPACE AND I WOULD MAKE THINGS
ArthurGanson_2004 MAKE THINGS FOR PEOPLE AS A WAY OF YOU KNOW GIVING SHOWING THEM MY LOVE I WOULD GO INTO THESE PRIVATE PLACES AND I WOULD PUT MY IDEAS
ArthurGanson_2004 AND MY PASSIONS INTO OBJECTS AND SORT OF LEARNING HOW TO SPEAK WITH MY HANDS SO THE WHOLE ACTIVITY OF WORKING WITH MY HANDS AND CREATING OBJECTS IS VERY MUCH CONNECTED
ArthurGanson_2004 WITH NOT ONLY THE IDEA REALM BUT ALSO WITH VERY MUCH THE FEELING REALM
ArthurGanson_2004 AND
ArthurGanson_2004 THE IDEAS ARE VERY DISPARATE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF PIECES AND THERE'S NO REAL CONNECTION BETWEEN ONE OR THE OTHER EXCEPT THAT THEY SORT OF COME OUT OF MY BRAIN
ArthurGanson_2004 AND THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT SORT OF THOUGHTS THAT ARE TRIGGERED BY LOOKING AT LIFE AND SEEING NATURE AND SEEING OBJECTS AND JUST HAVING KIND OF PLAYFUL RANDOM THOUGHTS ABOUT THINGS
ArthurGanson_2004 WHEN I WAS A CHILD
ArthurGanson_2004 I STARTED TO EXPLORE
ArthurGanson_2004 I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE WAY THINGS MOVED
ArthurGanson_2004 SO I STARTED TO EXPLORE MOTION BY MAKING LITTLE
ArthurGanson_2004 AND THIS IS ONE THAT I DID PROBABLY LIKE WHEN I WAS AROUND SEVENTH GRADE
ArthurGanson_2004 AND I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS DOING THIS I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT LITTLE ROCK THERE AND THE PATHWAY OF THE VEHICLES AS THEY WOULD FLY THROUGH THE AIR AND HOW
ArthurGanson_2004 THE CHARACTERS WOULD COME SHOOTING OUT OF THE CAR SO ON MY MIND I WAS
ArthurGanson_2004 THINKING ABOUT THE TRAJECTORY OF
ArthurGanson_2004 THE VEHICLES AND OF COURSE WHEN YOU'RE A LITTLE KID THERE'S ALWAYS DESTRUCTION
ArthurGanson_2004 SO IT HAS TO END WITH THIS GRATUITOUS VIOLENCE
ArthurGanson_2004 SO THAT WAS HOW I FIRST STARTED TO EXPLORE
ArthurGanson_2004 THE WAY THINGS MOVED AND EXPRESSED IT NOW WHEN I WENT TO
ArthurGanson_2004 COLLEGE I FOUND MYSELF
ArthurGanson_2004 MAKING FAIRLY COMPLICATED FRAGILE MACHINES
ArthurGanson_2004 AND THIS REALLY CAME ABOUT FROM HAVING MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF INTERESTS WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I LOVED TO PROGRAM COMPUTERS SO I SORT OF LIKED THE LOGICAL FLOW OF EVENTS
ArthurGanson_2004 I WAS ALSO VERY INTERESTED IN PERHAPS GOING INTO SURGERY AND BECOMING A SURGEON
ArthurGanson_2004 IT MEANT WORKING WITH MY HANDS IN A VERY FOCUSED INTENSE WAY
ArthurGanson_2004 SO I STARTED TAKING ART COURSES AND I FOUND A WAY TO MAKE SCULPTURE THAT BROUGHT TOGETHER MY LOVE FOR BEING VERY PRECISE WITH MY HANDS
ArthurGanson_2004 WITH COMING UP WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF LOGICAL
ArthurGanson_2004 FLOWS OF
ArthurGanson_2004 ENERGY THROUGH A
ArthurGanson_2004 ALSO WORKING WITH WIRE EVERYTHING THAT I DID WAS BOTH
ArthurGanson_2004 VISUAL AND A MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DECISION AT THE SAME TIME SO I WAS ABLE TO SORT OF EXERCISE ALL OF THAT NOW THIS
ArthurGanson_2004 KIND OF MACHINE IS AS CLOSE AS I CAN GET TO PAINTING AND IT'S FULL OF
ArthurGanson_2004 MANY LITTLE TRIVIAL END POINTS LIKE THERE'S A LITTLE FOOT HERE THAT JUST DRAGS AROUND IN CIRCLES AND IT DOESN'T REALLY MEAN ANYTHING IT'S REALLY JUST
ArthurGanson_2004 FOR THE SORT OF JOY OF ITS OWN
ArthurGanson_2004 CONNECTION I HAVE WITH ENGINEERING IS THE SAME AS ANY OTHER ENGINEER IN THAT I LOVE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS I LOVE TO FIGURE THINGS OUT BUT THE END RESULT OF WHAT I'M DOING IS
ArthurGanson_2004 REALLY COMPLETELY AMBIGUOUS
ArthurGanson_2004 THAT'S PRETTY AMBIGUOUS
ArthurGanson_2004 THE NEXT PIECE THAT
ArthurGanson_2004 IS GOING TO COME UP IS
ArthurGanson_2004 AN EXAMPLE OF A KIND OF MACHINE THAT IS
ArthurGanson_2004 FAIRLY COMPLEX
ArthurGanson_2004 I GAVE MYSELF THE PROBLEM SINCE I'M ALWAYS LIKING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS I GAVE MYSELF THE PROBLEM OF TURNING A CRANK IN ONE DIRECTION AND SOLVING ALL OF THE MECHANICAL PROBLEMS FOR GETTING THIS LITTLE MAN TO WALK BACK AND FORTH
ArthurGanson_2004 SO WHEN I STARTED THIS I DIDN'T HAVE AN OVERALL PLAN FOR THE MACHINE
ArthurGanson_2004 BUT I DID HAVE A SENSE OF THE GESTURE AND A SENSE OF THE SHAPE AND HOW IT WOULD OCCUPY SPACE AND THEN IT WAS A MATTER OF STARTING FROM ONE POINT AND SORT OF BUILDING TO THAT FINAL POINT
ArthurGanson_2004 IT REALLY IT'S ALMOST LIKE DOING
ArthurGanson_2004 IT CAME ABOUT FROM
ArthurGanson_2004 PLAYING WITH THIS WISHBONE AFTER DINNER YOU KNOW THEY SAY NEVER PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD BUT I ALWAYS PLAY WITH THINGS SO I HAD THIS WISHBONE AND I THOUGHT
ArthurGanson_2004 IT'S KIND OF LIKE A COWBOY WHO 'S BEEN ON HIS HORSE FOR TOO LONG AND I STARTED TO MAKE HIM WALK ACROSS THE TABLE AND I THOUGHT OH I CAN MAKE A LITTLE MACHINE THAT WILL DO THAT
ArthurGanson_2004 SO I MADE THIS DEVICE LINKED IT UP AND THE WISHBONE WALKS AND BECAUSE THE WISHBONE IS BONE IT'S ANIMAL IT'S SORT OF A POINT WHERE I
ArthurGanson_2004 THINK WE CAN ENTER INTO IT
ArthurGanson_2004 THIS KIND OF WORK IS ALSO VERY MUCH
ArthurGanson_2004 LIKE PUPPETRY
ArthurGanson_2004 WHERE THE FOUND OBJECT IS IN A SENSE THE PUPPET AND I'M THE PUPPETEER AT FIRST BECAUSE I'M PLAYING WITH AN OBJECT BUT THEN I MAKE THE MACHINE WHICH IS SORT OF THE STAND IN FOR ME AND IT IS ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE ACTION THAT I WANT
ArthurGanson_2004 THE NEXT PIECE I'LL SHOW YOU IS A MUCH MORE CONCEPTUAL THOUGHT AND IT'S A LITTLE PIECE CALLED CORY 'S YELLOW CHAIR
ArthurGanson_2004 I HAD THIS IMAGE IN MY MIND
ArthurGanson_2004 WHEN I SAW MY SON 'S LITTLE CHAIR AND I SAW IT EXPLODE
ArthurGanson_2004 SO THE WAY I SAW THIS IN MY MIND AT FIRST WAS THAT THE PIECES WOULD EXPLODE UP AND OUT WITH INFINITE SPEED AND THE PIECES WOULD MOVE FAR OUT
ArthurGanson_2004 THEN THEY WOULD BEGIN TO BE PULLED BACK WITH A KIND OF A GRAVITATIONAL FEEL TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WOULD APPROACH INFINITE SPEED BACK TO THE CENTER AND THEY WOULD COALESCE FOR JUST A MOMENT
ArthurGanson_2004 SO YOU COULD PERCEIVE THAT THERE WAS A CHAIR THERE
ArthurGanson_2004 FOR ME IT'S KIND OF A FEELING ABOUT THE FLEETINGNESS OF THE PRESENT MOMENT AND I WANTED TO EXPRESS THAT NOW
ArthurGanson_2004 THE MACHINE IS IN THIS CASE IT'S A REAL APPROXIMATION OF THAT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T MOVE PHYSICAL MATTER INFINITELY WITH INFINITE SPEED AND HAVE IT STOP INSTANTANEOUSLY
ArthurGanson_2004 THIS WHOLE THING IS ABOUT FOUR FEET WIDE AND THE CHAIR ITSELF
ArthurGanson_2004 IS ONLY ABOUT A FEW INCHES
ArthurGanson_2004 ON THE LEFT AND IT GOES THROUGH A GEAR TRAIN THERE ARE TWELVE PAIRS OF FIFTY TO ONE REDUCTIONS
ArthurGanson_2004 SO THAT MEANS THAT THE FINAL SPEED OF THAT GEAR ON THE END IS SO SLOW THAT IT WOULD TAKE TWO TRILLION YEARS TO TURN ONCE SO I'VE INVENTED IT IN CONCRETE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
ArthurGanson_2004 ALL THE
ArthurGanson_2004 NOW A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THOUGHT I'M ALWAYS IMAGINING MYSELF
ArthurGanson_2004 IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS I'M IMAGINING MYSELF AS A MACHINE WHAT WOULD I LOVE I WOULD LOVE TO BE BATHED IN OIL
ArthurGanson_2004 SO THIS MACHINE DOES NOTHING BUT JUST BATHE ITSELF
ArthurGanson_2004 AND IT'S REALLY JUST SORT OF FOR ME IT WAS JUST REALLY ABOUT THE LUSCIOUSNESS OF OIL
ArthurGanson_2004 I GOT A CALL FROM A FRIEND
ArthurGanson_2004 WHO WANTED TO HAVE A SHOW OF EROTIC ART AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PIECES BUT WHEN SHE SUGGESTED
ArthurGanson_2004 TO BE IN THE SHOW THIS PIECE CAME TO MIND SO IT'S SORT OF RELATED BUT YOU CAN SEE IT'S MUCH MORE OVERTLY EROTIC
ArthurGanson_2004 THIS IS A HAPPY MACHINE I'LL TELL YOU IT'S DEFINITELY HAPPY
ArthurGanson_2004 FROM AN ENGINEERING POINT OF VIEW THIS IS JUST A LITTLE FOUR BAR LINKAGE AND THEN AGAIN THIS IS A FOUND OBJECT A LITTLE FAN THAT I FOUND AND I THOUGHT
ArthurGanson_2004 WHAT ABOUT THE GESTURE OF OPENING THE FAN AND HOW SIMPLY COULD I STATE SOMETHING AND IN A CASE LIKE THIS I'M TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING WHICH
ArthurGanson_2004 IS CLEAR BUT ALSO NOT SUGGESTIVE OF ANY PARTICULAR KIND OF ANIMAL OR PLANT
ArthurGanson_2004 FOR ME THE PROCESS
ArthurGanson_2004 IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I'M INVENTING MACHINES BUT I'M ALSO INVENTING TOOLS TO MAKE MACHINES AND THE WHOLE THING IS ALL SORT OF WRAPPED UP FROM THE BEGINNING
ArthurGanson_2004 SO THIS IS A LITTLE WIRE BENDING TOOL AFTER MANY YEARS OF BENDING GEARS WITH A PAIR OF PLIERS I MADE THAT TOOL AND THEN I MADE THIS OTHER TOOL FOR SORT OF CENTERING GEARS VERY QUICKLY
ArthurGanson_2004 MY LIFE COMPLETELY CHANGED WHEN I FOUND A SPOT WELDER
ArthurGanson_2004 AND THAT WAS THAT TOOL IT COMPLETELY CHANGED WHAT I COULD DO NOW HERE I'M GOING TO DO A VERY
ArthurGanson_2004 POOR JOB OF SILVER SOLDERING
ArthurGanson_2004 THIS IS NOT THE WAY THEY TEACH YOU TO SILVER SOLDER WHEN YOU'RE IN SCHOOL I JUST LIKE THROW IT IN I MEAN REAL JEWELERS PUT LITTLE BITS OF SOLDER
ArthurGanson_2004 SO THAT'S A FINISHED
ArthurGanson_2004 WHEN I MOVED TO BOSTON I JOINED A GROUP
ArthurGanson_2004 CALLED THE WORLD SCULPTURE RACING SOCIETY
ArthurGanson_2004 AND THE IDEA
ArthurGanson_2004 THEIR PREMISE WAS THAT WE WANTED TO SHOW PIECES OF SCULPTURE ON THE STREET AND THERE'D BE NO SUBJECTIVE DECISION ABOUT WHAT WAS THE BEST IT WOULD BE WHATEVER CAME ACROSS THE FINISH LINE
ArthurGanson_2004 SO I MADE THIS IS MY FIRST RACING SCULPTURE AND I THOUGHT
ArthurGanson_2004 OH I'M GOING TO MAKE A CART AND I'M GOING TO HAVE IT I'M GOING TO HAVE MY HAND WRITING FASTER SO AS I RUN DOWN THE STREET THE CART 'S GOING TO TALK TO ME AND IT'S GOING TO GO FASTER FASTER
ArthurGanson_2004 SO THAT'S WHAT IT DOES
ArthurGanson_2004 THEN IN THE END WHAT I DECIDED WAS
ArthurGanson_2004 EVERY TIME YOU FINISH WRITING THE WORD I WOULD STOP AND I WOULD GIVE THE CARD TO SOMEBODY ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD SO I WOULD NEVER WIN THE RACE BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS STOPPING
ArthurGanson_2004 NOW I ONLY HAVE TWO AND A HALF MINUTES I'M GOING TO PLAY
ArthurGanson_2004 THIS IS A PIECE THAT FOR ME IS IN SOME WAYS THE MOST COMPLETE KIND OF PIECE BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A KID I ALSO PLAYED A LOT OF GUITAR
ArthurGanson_2004 AND WHEN I HAD THIS THOUGHT I WAS IMAGINING THAT I WOULD MAKE
ArthurGanson_2004 I WOULD HAVE A WHOLE MACHINE THEATER EVENING WHERE I WOULD YOU WOULD HAVE AN AUDIENCE THE CURTAIN WOULD OPEN AND YOU'D BE ENTERTAINED BY MACHINES ON STAGE SO I
ArthurGanson_2004 A VERY SIMPLE GESTURAL DANCE THAT WOULD BE BETWEEN A MACHINE AND JUST A VERY SIMPLE CHAIR
ArthurGanson_2004 AND
ArthurGanson_2004 I'M MAKING THESE PIECES I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND A POINT WHERE
ArthurGanson_2004 SAYING SOMETHING VERY CLEARLY AND IT'S VERY SIMPLE BUT ALSO AT THE SAME TIME IT'S VERY AMBIGUOUS
ArthurGanson_2004 AND I THINK THERE'S A POINT BETWEEN SIMPLICITY AND AMBIGUITY WHICH CAN ALLOW A VIEWER TO PERHAPS TAKE SOMETHING FROM IT
ArthurGanson_2004 AND THAT LEADS ME TO THE THOUGHT THAT ALL OF THESE PIECES START OFF IN MY OWN MIND IN MY HEART
ArthurGanson_2004 AND I DO MY BEST AT FINDING WAYS TO EXPRESS THEM WITH MATERIALS AND IT ALWAYS FEELS REALLY CRUDE IT'S ALWAYS A STRUGGLE
ArthurGanson_2004 BUT SOMEHOW I MANAGE TO SORT OF GET THIS THOUGHT OUT INTO AN OBJECT
ArthurGanson_2004 AND THEN IT'S THERE OK IT MEANS NOTHING AT ALL THE OBJECT ITSELF JUST MEANS NOTHING ONCE IT'S PERCEIVED AND
ArthurGanson_2004 SOMEONE BRINGS IT INTO THEIR OWN MIND THEN THERE'S A CYCLE THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND TO ME THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BECAUSE
ArthurGanson_2004 EVER SINCE BEING A KID I'VE WANTED TO COMMUNICATE MY PASSION AND LOVE AND THAT MEANS THE COMPLETE CYCLE OF COMING FROM INSIDE OUT TO THE PHYSICAL
ArthurGanson_2004 TO SOMEONE PERCEIVING
ArthurGanson_2004 SO I'LL JUST LET THIS CHAIR
