BrianGreene_2005@16.63:21.80 A VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN GERMAN MATHEMATICIAN NAMED THEODOR KALUZA
BrianGreene_2005@24.52:34.55 A VERY BOLD AND IN SOME WAYS A VERY BIZARRE IDEA HE PROPOSED THAT OUR UNIVERSE MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE MORE THAN THE THREE DIMENSIONS
BrianGreene_2005@34.86:46.01 THAT WE ARE ALL AWARE OF THAT IS IN ADDITION TO LEFT RIGHT BACK FORTH AND UP DOWN KALUZA PROPOSED THAT THERE MIGHT BE ADDITIONAL DIMENSIONS OF SPACE THAT FOR SOME REASON
BrianGreene_2005@56.21:66.21 AROUND US THIS PARTICULAR IDEA HOWEVER ALTHOUGH WE DON'T YET KNOW WHETHER IT'S RIGHT OR WRONG AND AT THE END I'LL DISCUSS EXPERIMENTS WHICH IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS MAY TELL US WHETHER IT'S RIGHT OR WRONG
BrianGreene_2005@66.60:78.25 THIS IDEA HAS HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON PHYSICS IN THE LAST CENTURY AND CONTINUES TO INFORM A LOT OF CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH SO I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE STORY OF THESE EXTRA DIMENSIONS
BrianGreene_2005@99.83:107.97 AND IN THAT MOMENT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE AROUND WHO THOUGHT THAT THAT PROJECT HAD ALREADY BEEN RESOLVED NEWTON HAD GIVEN THE WORLD
BrianGreene_2005@108.54:115.72 THEORY OF GRAVITY IN THE LATE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS THAT WORKS WELL DESCRIBES THE MOTION OF PLANETS THE MOTION OF THE MOON AND SO FORTH
BrianGreene_2005@116.29:123.69 THE MOTION OF APOCRYPHAL OF APPLES FALLING FROM TREES HITTING PEOPLE ON THE HEAD ALL OF THAT COULD BE DESCRIBED USING NEWTON 'S WORK BUT
BrianGreene_2005@124.18:132.19 EINSTEIN REALIZED THAT NEWTON HAD LEFT SOMETHING OUT OF THE STORY BECAUSE EVEN NEWTON HAD WRITTEN THAT ALTHOUGH HE UNDERSTOOD HOW
BrianGreene_2005@132.54:141.24 TO CALCULATE THE EFFECT OF GRAVITY HE'D BEEN UNABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT REALLY WORKS HOW IS IT THAT THE SUN NINETY THREE MILLION MILES AWAY SOMEHOW
BrianGreene_2005@141.79:147.92 THE MOTION OF THE EARTH HOW DOES THE SUN REACH OUT ACROSS EMPTY INERT SPACE AND EXERT
BrianGreene_2005@148.38:156.49 INFLUENCE AND THAT IS A TASK TO WHICH EINSTEIN SET HIMSELF TO FIGURE OUT HOW GRAVITY WORKS AND LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT IT IS THAT HE FOUND
BrianGreene_2005@156.87:163.70 SO EINSTEIN FOUND THAT THE MEDIUM THAT TRANSMITS GRAVITY IS SPACE ITSELF THE IDEA GOES LIKE THIS
BrianGreene_2005@175.07:184.18 OF SPACE TO WARP TO CURVE AND THAT COMMUNICATES THE FORCE OF GRAVITY EVEN THE EARTH WARPS SPACE AROUND IT NOW LOOK AT THE MOON
BrianGreene_2005@184.51:198.63 THE MOON IS KEPT IN ORBIT ACCORDING TO THESE IDEAS BECAUSE IT ROLLS ALONG A VALLEY IN THE CURVED ENVIRONMENT THAT THE SUN AND THE MOON AND THE EARTH CAN ALL CREATE BY VIRTUE OF THEIR PRESENCE WE GO TO A FULL FRAME VIEW OF THIS
BrianGreene_2005@199.07:209.61 THE EARTH ITSELF IS KEPT IN ORBIT BECAUSE IT ROLLS ALONG A VALLEY IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT'S CURVED BECAUSE OF THE SUN 'S PRESENCE THAT IS THIS NEW IDEA ABOUT HOW
BrianGreene_2005@210.73:212.80 ACTUALLY WORKS NOW
BrianGreene_2005@233.29:242.43 ONE THEORY THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE ALL OF NATURE 'S FORCES FROM ONE SET OF IDEAS ONE SET OF PRINCIPLES ONE MASTER EQUATION IF YOU WILL
BrianGreene_2005@242.74:257.05 SO KALUZA SAID TO HIMSELF EINSTEIN HAS BEEN ABLE TO DESCRIBE GRAVITY IN TERMS OF WARPS AND CURVES IN SPACE IN FACT SPACE AND TIME TO BE MORE PRECISE MAYBE I CAN PLAY THE SAME GAME WITH THE OTHER KNOWN FORCE WHICH
BrianGreene_2005@257.21:272.12 WAS AT THAT TIME KNOWN AS THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE WE KNOW OF OTHERS TODAY BUT AT THAT TIME THAT WAS THE ONLY OTHER ONE PEOPLE WERE THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THE FORCE RESPONSIBLE FOR ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETIC ATTRACTION AND SO FORTH SO KALUZA SAYS MAYBE I CAN PLAY THE SAME GAME AND DESCRIBE ELECTROMAGNETIC
BrianGreene_2005@272.44:277.90 FORCE IN TERMS OF WARPS AND CURVES THAT RAISED A QUESTION WARPS AND CURVES IN WHAT
BrianGreene_2005@288.77:290.32 SO KALUZA SAID WELL
BrianGreene_2005@290.98:301.28 MAYBE THERE ARE MORE DIMENSIONS OF SPACE HE SAID IF I WANT TO DESCRIBE ONE MORE FORCE MAYBE I NEED ONE MORE DIMENSION SO HE IMAGINED THAT THE WORLD HAD FOUR DIMENSIONS OF SPACE NOT THREE
BrianGreene_2005@301.70:312.30 AND IMAGINED THAT ELECTROMAGNETISM WAS WARPS AND CURVES IN THAT FOURTH DIMENSION NOW HERE 'S THE THING WHEN HE WROTE DOWN THE EQUATIONS DESCRIBING WARPS AND CURVES IN A UNIVERSE WITH FOUR SPACE DIMENSIONS NOT THREE
BrianGreene_2005@312.63:321.80 HE FOUND THE OLD EQUATIONS THAT EINSTEIN HAD ALREADY DERIVED IN THREE DIMENSIONS THOSE WERE FOR GRAVITY BUT HE FOUND ONE MORE EQUATION BECAUSE OF THE ONE MORE DIMENSION
BrianGreene_2005@322.17:329.20 AND WHEN HE LOOKED AT THAT EQUATION IT WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE EQUATION THAT SCIENTISTS HAD LONG KNOWN TO DESCRIBE THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE
BrianGreene_2005@329.68:337.93 AMAZING IT JUST POPPED OUT HE WAS SO EXCITED BY THIS REALIZATION THAT HE RAN AROUND HIS HOUSE SCREAMING VICTORY THAT HE HAD FOUND
BrianGreene_2005@342.33:350.72 KALUZA WAS A MAN WHO TOOK THEORY VERY SERIOUSLY HE IN FACT THERE IS A STORY THAT WHEN HE WANTED TO LEARN HOW TO SWIM
BrianGreene_2005@351.55:353.97 HE READ A BOOK A TREATISE ON SWIMMING
BrianGreene_2005@355.46:356.85 THEN DOVE INTO THE OCEAN
BrianGreene_2005@357.50:360.28 THIS IS A MAN WHO WOULD RISK HIS LIFE ON THEORY
BrianGreene_2005@360.93:370.89 NOW BUT FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE PRACTICALLY MINDED TWO QUESTIONS IMMEDIATELY ARISE FROM HIS OBSERVATION NUMBER ONE IF THERE ARE MORE DIMENSIONS IN SPACE WHERE ARE THEY
BrianGreene_2005@371.70:372.59 SEEM TO SEE THEM
BrianGreene_2005@372.98:382.13 AND NUMBER TWO DOES THIS THEORY REALLY WORK IN DETAIL WHEN YOU TRY TO APPLY IT TO THE WORLD AROUND US NOW THE FIRST QUESTION
BrianGreene_2005@390.35:402.25 THERE MIGHT BE BIG EASY TO SEE DIMENSIONS BUT THERE MIGHT ALSO BE TINY CURLED UP DIMENSIONS CURLED UP SO SMALL EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ALL AROUND US THAT WE DON'T SEE THEM LET ME SHOW YOU THAT ONE VISUALLY
BrianGreene_2005@414.33:422.92 BUT YOU AND I ALL KNOW THAT IT DOES HAVE SOME THICKNESS IT'S VERY HARD TO SEE IT THOUGH FROM FAR AWAY BUT IF WE ZOOM IN AND TAKE THE PERSPECTIVE OF SAY A LITTLE ANT WALKING AROUND
BrianGreene_2005@423.26:434.55 LITTLE ANTS ARE SO SMALL THAT THEY CAN ACCESS ALL OF THE DIMENSIONS THE LONG DIMENSION BUT ALSO THIS CLOCKWISE COUNTER CLOCKWISE DIRECTION AND I HOPE YOU APPRECIATE THIS IT TOOK SO LONG TO GET THESE ANTS TO DO THIS
BrianGreene_2005@435.66:444.88 BUT THIS ILLUSTRATES THE FACT THAT DIMENSIONS CAN BE OF TWO SORTS BIG AND SMALL AND THE IDEA THAT MAYBE THE BIG DIMENSIONS AROUND US ARE THE ONES THAT WE CAN EASILY SEE
BrianGreene_2005@445.19:451.19 BUT THERE MIGHT BE ADDITIONAL DIMENSIONS CURLED UP SORT OF LIKE THE CIRCULAR PART OF THAT CABLE SO SMALL
BrianGreene_2005@451.67:459.28 THAT THEY HAVE SO FAR REMAINED INVISIBLE LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE SO IF WE TAKE A LOOK SAY AT SPACE ITSELF
BrianGreene_2005@460.54:472.76 I CAN ONLY SHOW OF COURSE TWO DIMENSIONS ON A SCREEN SOME OF YOU GUYS WILL FIX THAT ONE DAY BUT ANYTHING THAT'S NOT FLAT ON A SCREEN IS A NEW DIMENSION GOES SMALLER SMALLER SMALLER AND WAY DOWN IN THE MICROSCOPIC DEPTHS OF SPACE ITSELF
BrianGreene_2005@473.10:479.10 THIS IS THE IDEA YOU COULD HAVE ADDITIONAL CURLED UP DIMENSIONS HERE IS A LITTLE SHAPE OF A CIRCLE SO SMALL THAT WE DON'T SEE THEM
BrianGreene_2005@479.40:489.14 BUT IF YOU WERE A LITTLE ULTRA MICROSCOPIC ANT WALKING AROUND YOU COULD WALK IN THE BIG DIMENSIONS THAT WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THAT'S LIKE THE GRID PART BUT YOU COULD ALSO ACCESS THE TINY CURLED UP
BrianGreene_2005@490.11:502.92 SO SMALL THAT WE CAN'T SEE IT WITH THE NAKED EYE OR EVEN WITH ANY OF OUR MOST REFINED EQUIPMENT BUT DEEPLY TUCKED INTO THE FABRIC OF SPACE ITSELF THE IDEA IS THERE COULD BE MORE DIMENSIONS AS WE SEE THERE NOW
BrianGreene_2005@504.92:512.64 THAT'S AN EXPLANATION ABOUT HOW THE UNIVERSE COULD HAVE MORE DIMENSIONS THAN THE ONES THAT WE SEE BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SECOND QUESTION THAT I ASKED
BrianGreene_2005@513.03:520.65 DOES THE THEORY ACTUALLY WORK WHEN YOU TRY TO APPLY IT TO THE REAL WORLD WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT EINSTEIN AND KALUZA AND MANY OTHERS
BrianGreene_2005@521.01:528.94 WORKED ON TRYING TO REFINE THIS FRAMEWORK AND APPLY IT TO THE PHYSICS OF THE UNIVERSE AS WAS UNDERSTOOD AT THE TIME
BrianGreene_2005@530.58:539.63 DETAIL IT DIDN'T WORK IN DETAIL FOR INSTANCE THEY COULDN'T GET THE MASS OF THE ELECTRON TO WORK OUT CORRECTLY IN THIS THEORY SO MANY PEOPLE WORKED ON IT BUT BY THE
BrianGreene_2005@540.77:548.77 BY THE FIFTIES THIS STRANGE BUT VERY COMPELLING IDEA OF HOW TO UNIFY THE LAWS OF PHYSICS HAD GONE AWAY
BrianGreene_2005@550.20:564.20 UNTIL SOMETHING WONDERFUL HAPPENED IN OUR AGE IN OUR ERA A NEW APPROACH TO UNIFY THE LAWS OF PHYSICS IS BEING PURSUED BY PHYSICISTS SUCH AS MYSELF MANY OTHERS AROUND THE WORLD IT'S CALLED SUPERSTRING THEORY AS YOU WERE INDICATING
BrianGreene_2005@564.58:572.26 AND THE WONDERFUL THING IS THAT SUPERSTRING THEORY HAS NOTHING TO DO AT FIRST SIGHT WITH THIS IDEA OF EXTRA DIMENSIONS
BrianGreene_2005@581.90:592.80 THEORY THAT TRIES TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHAT ARE THE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL INDIVISIBLE UNCUTTABLE CONSTITUENTS MAKING UP EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD AROUND US
BrianGreene_2005@593.16:598.49 THE IDEA IS LIKE THIS SO IMAGINE WE LOOK AT A FAMILIAR OBJECT JUST A
BrianGreene_2005@611.37:619.13 WE ALSO ALL KNOW THAT ATOMS ARE NOT THE END OF THE STORY THEY HAVE LITTLE
BrianGreene_2005@619.46:626.70 EVEN THE NEUTRONS AND PROTONS HAVE SMALLER PARTICLES INSIDE OF THEM KNOWN AS QUARKS THAT IS WHERE CONVENTIONAL IDEAS STOP
BrianGreene_2005@627.48:629.28 HERE IS THE NEW IDEA OF STRING THEORY
BrianGreene_2005@629.62:640.96 DEEP INSIDE ANY OF THESE PARTICLES THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THIS SOMETHING ELSE IS THIS DANCING FILAMENT OF ENERGY IT LOOKS LIKE A VIBRATING STRING THAT'S WHERE THE IDEA STRING THEORY COMES FROM
BrianGreene_2005@641.26:653.62 AND JUST LIKE THE VIBRATING STRINGS THAT YOU JUST SAW IN A CELLO CAN VIBRATE IN DIFFERENT PATTERNS THESE CAN ALSO VIBRATE IN DIFFERENT PATTERNS THEY DON'T PRODUCE DIFFERENT MUSICAL NOTES RATHER THEY PRODUCE THE DIFFERENT PARTICLES MAKING UP THE WORLD AROUND US
BrianGreene_2005@654.03:664.16 THESE IDEAS ARE CORRECT THIS IS WHAT THE ULTRA MICROSCOPIC LANDSCAPE OF THE UNIVERSE LOOKS LIKE IT'S BUILT UP OF A HUGE NUMBER OF THESE LITTLE TINY FILAMENTS
BrianGreene_2005@664.92:672.40 VIBRATING ENERGY VIBRATING IN DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES THE DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES PRODUCE THE DIFFERENT PARTICLES THE DIFFERENT PARTICLES
BrianGreene_2005@672.92:681.60 ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE RICHNESS IN THE WORLD AROUND US AND THERE YOU SEE UNIFICATION BECAUSE MATTER PARTICLES ELECTRONS AND QUARKS
BrianGreene_2005@691.58:695.74 PUT TOGETHER UNDER THE RUBRIC OF VIBRATING STRINGS AND THAT'S WHAT WE MEAN
BrianGreene_2005@695.98:699.93 BY A UNIFIED THEORY NOW HERE IS THE CATCH
BrianGreene_2005@700.84:712.02 WHEN YOU STUDY THE MATHEMATICS OF STRING THEORY YOU FIND THAT IT DOESN'T WORK IN A UNIVERSE THAT JUST HAS THREE DIMENSIONS OF SPACE IT DOESN'T WORK IN A UNIVERSE WITH FOUR DIMENSIONS OF SPACE NOR FIVE NOR SIX
BrianGreene_2005@712.66:719.44 FINALLY YOU CAN STUDY THE EQUATIONS AND SHOW THAT IT WORKS ONLY IN A UNIVERSE THAT HAS TEN DIMENSIONS OF SPACE
BrianGreene_2005@719.82:721.84 AND ONE DIMENSION OF TIME
BrianGreene_2005@723.27:729.45 US RIGHT BACK TO THIS IDEA OF KALUZA AND KLEIN THAT OUR WORLD WHEN APPROPRIATELY DESCRIBED
BrianGreene_2005@729.77:733.54 HAS MORE DIMENSIONS THAN THE ONES THAT WE SEE
BrianGreene_2005@733.83:739.47 NOW YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT THAT AND SAY WELL OK YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE EXTRA DIMENSIONS AND THEY'RE REALLY TIGHTLY CURLED UP
BrianGreene_2005@749.82:753.72 THAT IS TRUE ONE OF THE OTHER PREDICTIONS OF STRING THEORY
BrianGreene_2005@754.60:757.01 NO THAT'S NOT ONE OF THE OTHER PREDICTIONS OF STRING THEORY
BrianGreene_2005@758.21:762.93 BUT IT RAISES THE QUESTION ARE WE JUST TRYING TO HIDE AWAY THESE EXTRA DIMENSIONS OR
BrianGreene_2005@763.25:768.32 DO THEY TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THE WORLD IN THE REMAINING TIME I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU TWO FEATURES OF THEM
BrianGreene_2005@769.23:781.54 FIRST IS MANY OF US BELIEVE THAT THESE EXTRA DIMENSIONS HOLD THE ANSWER TO WHAT PERHAPS IS THE DEEPEST QUESTION IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS THEORETICAL SCIENCE AND THAT QUESTION IS THIS
BrianGreene_2005@781.94:793.83 WHEN WE LOOK AROUND THE WORLD AS SCIENTISTS HAVE DONE FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THERE APPEAR TO BE ABOUT TWENTY NUMBERS THAT REALLY DESCRIBE OUR UNIVERSE THESE ARE NUMBERS LIKE THE MASS OF THE PARTICLES LIKE ELECTRONS AND QUARKS
BrianGreene_2005@794.09:807.89 THE STRENGTH OF GRAVITY THE STRENGTH OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE A LIST OF ABOUT TWENTY NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN MEASURED WITH INCREDIBLE PRECISION BUT NOBODY HAS AN EXPLANATION FOR WHY THE NUMBERS HAVE THE PARTICULAR VALUES THAT THEY DO
BrianGreene_2005@820.02:826.48 IF THOSE NUMBERS HAD ANY OTHER VALUES THAN THE KNOWN ONES THE UNIVERSE AS WE KNOW IT WOULDN'T EXIST
BrianGreene_2005@826.92:841.38 THIS IS A DEEP QUESTION WHY ARE THOSE NUMBERS SO FINELY TUNED TO ALLOW STARS TO SHINE AND PLANETS TO FORM WHEN WE RECOGNIZE THAT IF YOU FIDDLE WITH THOSE NUMBERS IF I HAD TWENTY DIALS UP HERE AND I LET YOU COME UP AND FIDDLE WITH THOSE NUMBERS ALMOST ANY FIDDLING MAKES
BrianGreene_2005@842.30:852.34 THE UNIVERSE DISAPPEAR SO CAN WE EXPLAIN THOSE TWENTY NUMBERS AND STRING THEORY SUGGESTS THAT THOSE TWENTY NUMBERS HAVE TO DO WITH THE EXTRA DIMENSIONS LET ME SHOW YOU HOW
BrianGreene_2005@853.01:860.78 SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE EXTRA DIMENSIONS IN STRING THEORY IT'S NOT ONE EXTRA DIMENSION AS IN THE OLDER IDEAS OF KALUZA
BrianGreene_2005@861.09:872.11 AND KLEIN THIS IS WHAT STRING THEORY SAYS ABOUT THE EXTRA DIMENSIONS THEY HAVE A VERY RICH INTERTWINED GEOMETRY THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING KNOWN AS A CALABI YAU SHAPE
BrianGreene_2005@872.41:882.78 NAME ISN'T ALL THAT IMPORTANT BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THE EXTRA DIMENSIONS FOLD IN ON THEMSELVES AND INTERTWINE IN A VERY INTERESTING SHAPE INTERESTING STRUCTURE
BrianGreene_2005@883.28:891.64 AND THE IDEA IS THAT IF THIS IS WHAT THE EXTRA DIMENSIONS LOOK LIKE THEN THE MICROSCOPIC LANDSCAPE OF OUR UNIVERSE ALL AROUND US
BrianGreene_2005@891.84:900.06 WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS ON THE TINIEST OF SCALES WHEN YOU SWING YOUR HAND YOU'D BE MOVING AROUND THESE EXTRA DIMENSIONS OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT THEY'RE SO SMALL THAT WE WOULDN'T KNOW IT
BrianGreene_2005@900.29:913.62 SO WHAT IS THE PHYSICAL IMPLICATION THOUGH RELEVANT TO THOSE TWENTY NUMBERS CONSIDER THIS IF YOU LOOK AT THE INSTRUMENT A FRENCH HORN NOTICE THAT THE VIBRATIONS OF THE AIRSTREAMS ARE AFFECTED BY THE SHAPE OF THE INSTRUMENT NOW IN STRING THEORY ALL THE NUMBERS
BrianGreene_2005@914.02:921.08 ARE REFLECTIONS OF THE WAY STRINGS CAN VIBRATE SO JUST AS THOSE AIRSTREAMS ARE AFFECTED BY THE TWISTS AND TURNS IN THE INSTRUMENT
BrianGreene_2005@921.60:929.18 STRINGS THEMSELVES WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE VIBRATIONAL PATTERNS IN THE GEOMETRY WITHIN WHICH THEY ARE MOVING SO LET ME BRING SOME STRINGS INTO THE STORY
BrianGreene_2005@929.42:938.42 AND IF YOU WATCH THESE LITTLE FELLOWS VIBRATING AROUND THEY'LL BE THERE IN A SECOND RIGHT THERE NOTICE THAT THEY WAY THEY VIBRATE IS AFFECTED BY THE GEOMETRY OF THE EXTRA DIMENSIONS
BrianGreene_2005@938.74:952.79 SO IF WE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE EXTRA DIMENSIONS LOOK LIKE WE DON'T YET BUT IF WE DID WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CALCULATE THE ALLOWED NOTES THE ALLOWED VIBRATIONAL PATTERNS AND IF WE COULD CALCULATE THE ALLOWED VIBRATIONAL PATTERNS WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CALCULATE
BrianGreene_2005@953.33:962.47 THOSE TWENTY NUMBERS AND IF THE ANSWER THAT WE GET FROM OUR CALCULATIONS AGREES WITH THE VALUES OF THOSE NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN DETERMINED THROUGH
BrianGreene_2005@962.91:969.71 DETAILED AND PRECISE EXPERIMENTATION THIS IN MANY WAYS WOULD BE THE FIRST FUNDAMENTAL EXPLANATION
BrianGreene_2005@970.18:974.05 FOR WHY THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE IS THE WAY IT
BrianGreene_2005@975.01:977.34 NOW THE SECOND ISSUE THAT I WANT TO FINISH UP WITH
BrianGreene_2005@978.51:992.65 HOW MIGHT WE TEST FOR THESE EXTRA DIMENSIONS MORE DIRECTLY IS THIS JUST AN INTERESTING MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN SOME PREVIOUSLY UNEXPLAINED FEATURES OF THE WORLD
BrianGreene_2005@993.08:1005.39 OR CAN WE ACTUALLY TEST FOR THESE EXTRA DIMENSIONS AND WE THINK AND THIS IS I THINK VERY EXCITING THAT IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS OR SO WE MAY BE ABLE TO TEST FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THESE EXTRA DIMENSIONS HERE 'S HOW IT GOES
BrianGreene_2005@1007.08:1014.72 IN CERN GENEVA SWITZERLAND A MACHINE IS BEING BUILT CALLED THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER IT'S A MACHINE THAT WILL SEND PARTICLES
BrianGreene_2005@1015.07:1022.75 AROUND A TUNNEL OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS NEAR THE SPEED OF LIGHT EVERY SO OFTEN THOSE PARTICLES WILL BE AIMED AT EACH OTHER SO THERE'S A HEAD ON COLLISION
BrianGreene_2005@1023.92:1024.87 THE HOPE IS
BrianGreene_2005@1025.16:1032.70 THAT IF THE COLLISION HAS ENOUGH ENERGY IT MAY EJECT SOME OF THE DEBRIS FROM THE COLLISION FROM OUR DIMENSIONS
BrianGreene_2005@1045.03:1057.51 AFTER THE COLLISION THAN BEFORE THIS WILL BE EVIDENCE THAT THE ENERGY HAS DRIFTED AWAY AND IF IT DRIFTS AWAY IN THE RIGHT PATTERN THAT WE CAN CALCULATE THIS WILL BE EVIDENCE THAT THE EXTRA DIMENSIONS ARE THERE LET ME SHOW YOU THAT IDEA VISUALLY SO IMAGINE WE
BrianGreene_2005@1058.24:1067.38 A CERTAIN KIND OF PARTICLE CALLED A GRAVITON THAT'S THE KIND OF DEBRIS WE EXPECT TO BE EJECTED OUT IF THE EXTRA DIMENSIONS ARE REAL BUT HERE 'S HOW THE EXPERIMENT WILL GO
BrianGreene_2005@1067.67:1081.92 YOU TAKE THESE PARTICLES YOU SLAM THEM TOGETHER YOU SLAM THEM TOGETHER AND IF WE ARE RIGHT SOME OF THE ENERGY OF THAT COLLISION WILL GO INTO DEBRIS THAT FLIES OFF INTO THESE EXTRA DIMENSIONS SO THIS IS THE KIND OF EXPERIMENT THAT WE'LL BE LOOKING AT IN THE NEXT FIVE
BrianGreene_2005@1082.40:1089.63 SEVEN TO TEN YEARS OR SO AND IF THIS EXPERIMENT BEARS FRUIT IF WE SEE THAT KIND OF PARTICLE EJECTED
BrianGreene_2005@1090.01:1097.83 BY NOTICING THAT THERE'S LESS ENERGY IN OUR DIMENSIONS THAN WHEN WE BEGAN THIS WILL SHOW THAT THE EXTRA DIMENSIONS ARE REAL
BrianGreene_2005@1098.20:1108.91 AND TO ME THIS IS A REALLY REMARKABLE STORY AND A REMARKABLE OPPORTUNITY GOING BACK TO NEWTON WITH ABSOLUTE SPACE DIDN'T PROVIDE ANYTHING BUT AN ARENA A STAGE IN WHICH THE EVENTS OF THE UNIVERSE TAKE PLACE
BrianGreene_2005@1109.46:1116.72 EINSTEIN COMES ALONG AND SAYS WELL SPACE AND TIME CAN WARP AND CURVE THAT'S WHAT GRAVITY IS AND NOW STRING THEORY COMES ALONG
BrianGreene_2005@1116.90:1124.47 AND SAYS YES GRAVITY QUANTUM MECHANICS ELECTROMAGNETISM ALL TOGETHER IN ONE PACKAGE BUT ONLY IF THE UNIVERSE HAS MORE DIMENSIONS
BrianGreene_2005@1124.82:1126.79 THAN THE ONES THAT WE SEE
BrianGreene_2005@1127.54:1131.49 AND THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT THAT MAY TEST FOR THEM IN OUR LIFETIME
