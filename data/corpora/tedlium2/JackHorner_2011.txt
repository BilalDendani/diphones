JackHorner_2011 I HAD TWO DREAMS
JackHorner_2011 I WANTED TO BE A PALEONTOLOGIST A DINOSAUR PALEONTOLOGIST
JackHorner_2011 AND I WANTED TO HAVE A PET DINOSAUR
JackHorner_2011 I WAS VERY FORTUNATE EARLY IN MY CAREER
JackHorner_2011 I WAS FORTUNATE IN FINDING THINGS I WASN 'T VERY GOOD AT READING THINGS IN FACT I DON 'T READ MUCH OF ANYTHING
JackHorner_2011 I AM EXTREMELY DYSLEXIC AND SO
JackHorner_2011 READING IS THE HARDEST THING I DO
JackHorner_2011 I HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO FIND THINGS LIKE
JackHorner_2011 THE FIRST EGGS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE AND
JackHorner_2011 THE FIRST BABY DINOSAURS IN NESTS
JackHorner_2011 THE FIRST DINOSAUR EMBRYOS AND MASSIVE ACCUMULATIONS OF BONES
JackHorner_2011 PEOPLE WERE JUST STARTING TO BEGIN TO REALIZE THAT DINOSAURS WEREN 'T THE BIG
JackHorner_2011 STUPID GREEN REPTILES THAT PEOPLE HAD THOUGHT FOR SO MANY YEARS PEOPLE WERE STARTING TO GET AN IDEA THAT DINOSAURS WERE SPECIAL
JackHorner_2011 AND SO AT THAT TIME I WAS ABLE TO MAKE SOME INTERESTING HYPOTHESES ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES WE WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY SAY THAT DINOSAURS BASED ON THE EVIDENCE WE HAD THAT DINOSAURS
JackHorner_2011 AND CARED FOR THEIR YOUNG BROUGHT FOOD TO THEIR BABIES
JackHorner_2011 AND TRAVELED IN GIGANTIC HERDS
JackHorner_2011 I HAVE GONE ON TO FIND MORE THINGS AND DISCOVER THAT DINOSAURS REALLY WERE VERY SOCIAL WE HAVE FOUND
JackHorner_2011 A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT DINOSAURS CHANGED FROM WHEN THEY WERE JUVENILES TO WHEN THEY WERE ADULTS THE APPEARANCE OF THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT
JackHorner_2011 WHICH IT IS IN ALL SOCIAL ANIMALS IN SOCIAL GROUPS OF ANIMALS THE JUVENILES ALWAYS LOOK DIFFERENT THAN THE ADULTS
JackHorner_2011 THE ADULTS CAN RECOGNIZE THE JUVENILES THE JUVENILES CAN RECOGNIZE THE ADULTS
JackHorner_2011 MICHAEL CRICHTON AND IN HIS BOOK HE TALKED ABOUT THE SOCIAL ANIMALS AND THEN STEVEN SPIELBERG OF COURSE DEPICTS THESE DINOSAURS AS BEING VERY SOCIAL CREATURES
JackHorner_2011 THE THEME OF THIS STORY IS BUILDING A DINOSAUR AND SO
JackHorner_2011 WE COME TO THAT PART OF JURASSIC PARK MICHAEL CRICHTON REALLY WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT BRINGING DINOSAURS BACK TO LIFE
JackHorner_2011 YOU ALL KNOW THE STORY RIGHT I MEAN I ASSUME EVERYONE HERE HAS SEEN JURASSIC PARK IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A DINOSAUR YOU GO OUT YOU FIND YOURSELF A PIECE OF PETRIFIED TREE SAP
JackHorner_2011 OTHERWISE KNOWN AS AMBER
JackHorner_2011 SUCKED DINOSAUR DNA OUT
JackHorner_2011 AND YOU TAKE YOUR DNA BACK TO THE LABORATORY AND YOU CLONE IT AND I GUESS YOU INJECT IT INTO MAYBE AN OSTRICH EGG OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN
JackHorner_2011 YOU WAIT AND LO AND BEHOLD OUT POPS
JackHorner_2011 THE DINOSAURS BEING SOCIAL
JackHorner_2011 ACT OUT THEIR SOCIALNESS AND THEY GET TOGETHER
JackHorner_2011 AND THEY CONSPIRE
JackHorner_2011 AND OF COURSE THAT 'S WHAT MAKES STEVEN SPIELBERG 'S MOVIE
JackHorner_2011 CONSPIRING DINOSAURS
JackHorner_2011 CHASING PEOPLE AROUND SO I ASSUME EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT IF YOU ACTUALLY HAD A PIECE OF AMBER AND IT HAD AN INSECT IN IT AND YOU
JackHorner_2011 DRILLED INTO IT AND YOU
JackHorner_2011 GOT SOMETHING OUT OF THAT INSECT AND YOU CLONED IT AND YOU DID IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
JackHorner_2011 YOU 'D HAVE A ROOM FULL OF MOSQUITOS
JackHorner_2011 NOW IF YOU WANT DINOSAUR DNA I SAY GO TO THE DINOSAUR
JackHorner_2011 TO ATTEMPT TO EXTRACT DNA FROM A DINOSAUR AND WE CHOSE THE DINOSAUR ON THE LEFT A TYRANNOSAURUS REX WHICH WAS A VERY NICE SPECIMEN AND ONE OF MY FORMER DOCTORAL STUDENTS DR MARY SCHWEITZER
JackHorner_2011 ACTUALLY HAD THE BACKGROUND TO DO THIS SORT OF THING AND SO
JackHorner_2011 SHE LOOKED INTO THE BONE OF THIS T REX ONE OF THE THIGH BONES
JackHorner_2011 AND SHE ACTUALLY FOUND SOME VERY INTERESTING STRUCTURES IN THERE
JackHorner_2011 THEY FOUND THESE RED CIRCULAR LOOKING OBJECTS
JackHorner_2011 AND THEY LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE RED BLOOD CELLS AND THEY 'RE IN WHAT APPEAR TO BE THE BLOOD CHANNELS THAT GO THROUGH THE BONE AND SO SHE THOUGHT WELL WHAT THE HECK
JackHorner_2011 FIND SOME DINOSAURS THAT HAD MORE MATERIAL IN THEM
JackHorner_2011 AND OUT IN EASTERN MONTANA
JackHorner_2011 YOU CAN GO OUT THERE AND FIND A LOT OF STUFF AND WE DID FIND A LOT OF STUFF WE FOUND A LOT OF TYRANNOSAURS BUT WE FOUND ONE SPECIAL TYRANNOSAUR AND WE CALLED IT B REX
JackHorner_2011 AND B REX WAS FOUND UNDER A THOUSAND CUBIC YARDS OF ROCK
JackHorner_2011 IT WASN 'T A VERY COMPLETE T REX AND IT WASN 'T A VERY BIG T REX
JackHorner_2011 BUT IT WAS A VERY SPECIAL B REX
JackHorner_2011 AND I AND MY COLLEAGUES CUT INTO IT AND WE WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE BY LOOKING AT LINES OF ARRESTED GROWTH SOME LINES IN IT THAT B REX HAD DIED AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN
JackHorner_2011 WE DON 'T REALLY KNOW HOW LONG DINOSAURS LIVED BECAUSE WE HAVEN 'T FOUND THE OLDEST ONE YET
JackHorner_2011 BUT THIS ONE DIED AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN
JackHorner_2011 WE GAVE SAMPLES TO MARY SCHWEITZER AND SHE WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT B REX WAS A FEMALE
JackHorner_2011 BASED ON MEDULLARY TISSUE FOUND ON THE INSIDE OF THE BONE MEDULLARY TISSUE IS THE CALCIUM BUILD UP
JackHorner_2011 THE CALCIUM STORAGE BASICALLY WHEN AN ANIMAL IS PREGNANT WHEN A BIRD IS PREGNANT
JackHorner_2011 SO HERE WAS THE CHARACTER THAT LINKED BIRDS AND DINOSAURS
JackHorner_2011 BUT MARY WENT FURTHER SHE TOOK THE BONE AND SHE DUMPED IT INTO ACID
JackHorner_2011 AND SO IF YOU DUMP IT INTO ACID THERE SHOULDN 'T BE ANYTHING LEFT
JackHorner_2011 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING LEFT
JackHorner_2011 THERE WERE BLOOD VESSELS LEFT
JackHorner_2011 THERE WERE FLEXIBLE CLEAR BLOOD VESSELS
JackHorner_2011 AND SO HERE WAS THE FIRST SOFT TISSUE FROM A DINOSAUR
JackHorner_2011 BUT SHE DID FIND EVIDENCE OF PROTEINS
JackHorner_2011 BUT WE THOUGHT MAYBE WELL
JackHorner_2011 AND SO WE BUILT A LABORATORY IN THE BACK OF AN EIGHTEEN WHEELER TRAILER
JackHorner_2011 WHERE WE COULD GET BETTER SAMPLES AND WE DID WE GOT
JackHorner_2011 THE VESSELS LOOKED BETTER
JackHorner_2011 FOUND THE PROTEIN COLLAGEN I MEAN IT WAS WONDERFUL STUFF
JackHorner_2011 BUT IT 'S NOT DINOSAUR DNA
JackHorner_2011 BIRDS ARE LIVING DINOSAURS
JackHorner_2011 WE ACTUALLY CLASSIFY THEM
JackHorner_2011 AS DINOSAURS WE NOW CALL THEM NON AVIAN DINOSAURS AND AVIAN DINOSAURS
JackHorner_2011 SO THE NON AVIAN DINOSAURS ARE THE BIG CLUNKY ONES THAT WENT EXTINCT
JackHorner_2011 AVIAN DINOSAURS ARE OUR MODERN BIRDS
JackHorner_2011 SO WE DON 'T HAVE TO MAKE A DINOSAUR BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE
JackHorner_2011 THE SIXTH GRADERS LOOK AT IT AND THEY SAY
JackHorner_2011 THE CHICKEN IS A DINOSAUR
JackHorner_2011 WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME EVOLUTIONARY TOOLS
JackHorner_2011 AND WE KNOW SELECTION WORKS WE STARTED OUT WITH A WOLF LIKE CREATURE AND WE ENDED UP WITH A MALTESE
JackHorner_2011 OR ANY OF THE OTHER FUNNY LOOKING LITTLE DOGS
JackHorner_2011 BUT THERE 'S ANOTHER THING THERE 'S WHAT WE CALL ATAVISM ACTIVATION AND ATAVISM ACTIVATION IS
JackHorner_2011 AND IT 'S BECAUSE
JackHorner_2011 IT 'S AN ANCESTRAL CHARACTERISTIC
JackHorner_2011 AND SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ATAVISMS THAT CAN HAPPEN
JackHorner_2011 SNAKES ARE OCCASIONALLY BORN WITH LEGS
JackHorner_2011 AND HERE 'S AN EXAMPLE THIS IS A CHICKEN
JackHorner_2011 NOW THAT 'S A GOOD CHARACTERISTIC WE CAN SAVE THAT ONE WE KNOW WE CAN USE THAT
JackHorner_2011 WE CAN MAKE A CHICKEN WITH TEETH
JackHorner_2011 IF YOU CAN FIND THOSE I CAN JUST REVERSE THEM
JackHorner_2011 AND SO HE AGREED AND SO
JackHorner_2011 THAT 'S WHAT WE 'RE LOOKING INTO IF YOU LOOK AT DINOSAUR HANDS A VELOCIRAPTOR HAS THAT COOL LOOKING HAND WITH THE CLAWS ON IT ARCHAEOPTERYX WHICH IS A BIRD A PRIMITIVE BIRD STILL HAS THAT VERY PRIMITIVE HAND BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THE PIGEON OR A CHICKEN OR ANYTHING ELSE ANOTHER BIRD
JackHorner_2011 HAS KIND OF A WEIRD LOOKING HAND BECAUSE
JackHorner_2011 THE HAND ACTUALLY
JackHorner_2011 BUT A GENE TURNS ON THAT ACTUALLY FUSES THOSE TOGETHER
JackHorner_2011 AND THE SAME GOES FOR THE TAILS
JackHorner_2011 BIRDS HAVE BASICALLY
JackHorner_2011 RUDIMENTARY TAILS
JackHorner_2011 BUT A GENE TURNS ON AND RESORBS THE TAIL
JackHorner_2011 BUT IT 'S JUST THE VERY BASICS
JackHorner_2011 SO THAT REALLY IS WHAT WE 'RE DOING AND PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY WHY DO THAT WHY MAKE THIS THING WHAT GOOD IS
JackHorner_2011 WELL THAT 'S A GOOD QUESTION
JackHorner_2011 ACTUALLY I THINK IT 'S A GREAT WAY TO TEACH KIDS ABOUT EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS AND
JackHorner_2011 COLONEL SANDERS WAS TO
JackHorner_2011 BE CAREFUL HOW HE WORDED IT HE COULD ACTUALLY ADVERTISE AN EXTRA PIECE
JackHorner_2011 IT WILL BE OBVIOUSLY THE POSTER CHILD OR WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A POSTER CHICK
JackHorner_2011 FOR TECHNOLOGY ENTERTAINMENT AND DESIGN
