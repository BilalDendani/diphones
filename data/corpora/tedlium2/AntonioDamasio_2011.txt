AntonioDamasio_2011 OF CONSCIOUS MINDS
AntonioDamasio_2011 THE WONDER IS ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE ALL WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND WE HAD WITH IT THE AMAZING RETURN OF OUR CONSCIOUS MIND WE RECOVERED MINDS WITH A COMPLETE SENSE OF SELF AND A COMPLETE SENSE OF OUR OWN EXISTENCE
AntonioDamasio_2011 WONDER WE SHOULD IN FACT BECAUSE WITHOUT HAVING THIS POSSIBILITY OF CONSCIOUS MINDS WE WOULD HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE WHATSOEVER ABOUT OUR HUMANITY WE WOULD HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE WHATSOEVER
AntonioDamasio_2011 ABOUT THE WORLD WE WOULD HAVE NO PAINS BUT ALSO NO JOYS WE WOULD HAVE NO ACCESS TO LOVE OR TO THE ABILITY TO CREATE
AntonioDamasio_2011 AND OF COURSE SCOTT FITZGERALD SAID FAMOUSLY THAT HE WHO INVENTED CONSCIOUSNESS WOULD HAVE A LOT TO BE BLAMED FOR BUT HE ALSO FORGOT THAT WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS HE WOULD HAVE NO ACCESS TO TRUE HAPPINESS AND EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF TRANSCENDENCE
AntonioDamasio_2011 SO MUCH FOR THE WONDER NOW FOR THE MYSTERY THIS IS A MYSTERY THAT HAS REALLY BEEN EXTREMELY HARD TO ELUCIDATE ALL THE WAY BACK INTO EARLY PHILOSOPHY AND CERTAINLY THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF NEUROSCIENCE THIS HAS BEEN ONE MYSTERY THAT HAS ALWAYS RESISTED ELUCIDATION
AntonioDamasio_2011 IN OUR BRAINS BUT WE CERTAINLY CAN BEGIN TO APPROACH THE QUESTION AND WE CAN BEGIN TO SEE THE SHAPE OF A SOLUTION
AntonioDamasio_2011 AND ONE MORE WONDER TO CELEBRATE IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES THAT NOW ALLOW US TO GO INSIDE THE HUMAN BRAIN
AntonioDamasio_2011 AND BE ABLE TO DO FOR EXAMPLE WHAT YOU 'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW THESE ARE IMAGES THAT COME FROM HANNA DAMASIO 'S LAB AND WHICH SHOW YOU IN A LIVING BRAIN THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THAT BRAIN AND THIS IS A PERSON WHO IS ALIVE THIS IS NOT A PERSON THAT IS
AntonioDamasio_2011 BEING STUDIED AT AUTOPSY AND EVEN MORE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ONE CAN BE REALLY
AntonioDamasio_2011 AMAZED ABOUT IS WHAT I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU NEXT WHICH IS GOING UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE OF THE BRAIN AND ACTUALLY LOOKING IN THE LIVING BRAIN AT REAL CONNECTIONS REAL PATHWAYS SO ALL OF THOSE COLORED LINES CORRESPOND TO BUNCHES OF AXONS
AntonioDamasio_2011 THE FIBERS THAT JOIN CELL BODIES TO SYNAPSES
AntonioDamasio_2011 AND I 'M SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU THEY DON 'T COME IN COLOR BUT AT ANY RATE THEY ARE THERE THE COLORS ARE CODES FOR THE DIRECTION FROM WHETHER IT IS BACK TO FRONT OR VICE VERSA AT ANY RATE WHAT IS CONSCIOUSNESS WHAT IS A CONSCIOUS MIND AND WE COULD
AntonioDamasio_2011 TAKE A VERY SIMPLE VIEW AND SAY WELL IT IS THAT WHICH WE LOSE WHEN WE FALL INTO DEEP SLEEP WITHOUT DREAMS OR WHEN WE GO UNDER ANESTHESIA AND IT IS WHAT WE REGAIN WHEN WE RECOVER FROM SLEEP OR FROM ANESTHESIA
AntonioDamasio_2011 BUT WHAT IS EXACTLY THAT STUFF THAT WE LOSE UNDER ANESTHESIA OR WHEN WE ARE IN DEEP DREAMLESS SLEEP
AntonioDamasio_2011 WELL FIRST OF ALL IT IS A MIND WHICH IS A FLOW OF MENTAL IMAGES AND OF COURSE CONSIDER IMAGES THAT CAN BE SENSORY PATTERNS VISUAL SUCH AS YOU 'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW IN RELATION TO THE STAGE AND ME OR AUDITORY IMAGES AS YOU ARE HAVING NOW IN RELATION TO MY WORDS
AntonioDamasio_2011 THAT FLOW OF MENTAL IMAGES IS MIND BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE ARE ALL EXPERIENCING IN THIS ROOM WE ARE NOT PASSIVE EXHIBITORS OF VISUAL OR AUDITORY OR TACTILE IMAGES
AntonioDamasio_2011 WE HAVE SELVES WE HAVE A ME THAT IS AUTOMATICALLY PRESENT IN OUR MINDS RIGHT NOW WE OWN OUR MINDS
AntonioDamasio_2011 AND WE HAVE A SENSE THAT IT 'S
AntonioDamasio_2011 EVERYONE OF US THAT IS EXPERIENCING THIS NOT THE PERSON WHO IS SITTING NEXT TO YOU SO IN ORDER TO HAVE A CONSCIOUS MIND YOU HAVE A SELF WITHIN THE CONSCIOUS
AntonioDamasio_2011 SO WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW TO EVEN ADDRESS THIS MYSTERY IS NUMBER ONE HOW ARE MINDS ARE PUT TOGETHER IN THE BRAIN AND NUMBER TWO HOW SELVES ARE CONSTRUCTED
AntonioDamasio_2011 IMAGINE NEURONS AND PICTURE IF YOU WILL A BILLBOARD A DIGITAL BILLBOARD WHERE YOU HAVE ELEMENTS THAT CAN BE EITHER LIT
AntonioDamasio_2011 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GRID OF NEURONS AND THE TOPOGRAPHICAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE ACTIVITY OF
AntonioDamasio_2011 THE NEURONS AND OUR MENTAL EXPERIENCE I 'M GOING TO TELL YOU A PERSONAL STORY SO IF I COVER MY LEFT EYE I 'M TALKING ABOUT ME PERSONALLY NOT ALL OF YOU IF I COVER MY LEFT EYE I LOOK AT THE GRID PRETTY MUCH LIKE THE ONE I 'M SHOWING YOU EVERYTHING IS NICE AND FINE AND PERPENDICULAR
AntonioDamasio_2011 BUT SOMETIME AGO I DISCOVERED THAT IF I COVER MY LEFT EYE INSTEAD WHAT I GET IS THIS I LOOK AT THE GRID AND I SEE A WARPING AT THE EDGE OF MY CENTRAL LEFT FIELD
AntonioDamasio_2011 BUT ON MY LEFT RETINA THERE IS A BUMP WHICH IS MARKED THERE BY THE RED ARROW AND IT CORRESPONDS TO A LITTLE CYST THAT IS LOCATED BELOW AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT CAUSES THE WARPING OF MY
AntonioDamasio_2011 VISUAL IMAGE SO JUST THINK OF THIS YOU HAVE A GRID OF NEURONS AND NOW YOU HAVE A PLANE
AntonioDamasio_2011 MECHANICAL CHANGE IN THE POSITION OF THE GRID
AntonioDamasio_2011 AND YOU GET A WARPING OF YOUR MENTAL EXPERIENCE
AntonioDamasio_2011 SO THIS IS HOW CLOSE YOUR MENTAL EXPERIENCE AND THE ACTIVITY OF THE NEURONS IN THE RETINA WHICH IS A PART OF THE BRAIN LOCATED IN THE EYEBALL OR FOR THAT MATTER A SHEET OF VISUAL CORTEX SO FROM THE RETINA YOU GO ONTO VISUAL CORTEX AND
AntonioDamasio_2011 AND IN THAT IMAGE THERE YOU SEE A VARIETY OF ISLANDS OF WHAT I CALL IMAGE MAKING REGIONS IN THE BRAIN YOU HAVE THE GREEN FOR EXAMPLE THAT CORRESPONDS TO TACTILE INFORMATION OR THE BLUE THAT CORRESPONDS TO AUDITORY INFORMATION AND SOMETHING ELSE
AntonioDamasio_2011 WHERE YOU HAVE THE PLOTTING OF ALL THESE NEURAL MAPS
AntonioDamasio_2011 CAN THEN PROVIDE SIGNALS
AntonioDamasio_2011 TO THIS OCEAN OF PURPLE THAT YOU SEE AROUND WHICH IS THE ASSOCIATION CORTEX
AntonioDamasio_2011 WHERE YOU CAN MAKE RECORDS OF WHAT WENT ON IN THOSE ISLANDS
AntonioDamasio_2011 OF IMAGE MAKING AND THE GREAT BEAUTY IS THAT YOU CAN THEN GO FROM MEMORY OUT OF THOSE ASSOCIATION CORTICES AND PRODUCE BACK IMAGES
AntonioDamasio_2011 IN THE VERY SAME REGIONS THAT HAVE PERCEPTION SO THINK ABOUT HOW WONDERFULLY CONVENIENT AND LAZY THE BRAIN IS SO IT PROVIDES CERTAIN AREAS FOR PERCEPTION AND IMAGE MAKING AND THOSE ARE EXACTLY THE SAME THAT ARE GOING TO BE USED
AntonioDamasio_2011 FOR IMAGE MAKING WHEN WE RECALL INFORMATION SO FAR THE MYSTERY OF THE CONSCIOUS MIND IS DIMINISHING A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE WE HAVE A GENERAL SENSE OF HOW WE MAKE THESE IMAGES BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SELF THE SELF IS REALLY THE ELUSIVE
AntonioDamasio_2011 AND USE THEM AS THE REFERENCE FOR ALL OTHER MAPS SO LET ME TELL YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW I CAME TO THIS
AntonioDamasio_2011 I CAME TO THIS BECAUSE IF YOU 'RE GOING TO HAVE A REFERENCE THAT WE KNOW AS SELF THE ME THE I IN OUR OWN PROCESSING WE NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS STABLE SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT DEVIATE MUCH
AntonioDamasio_2011 FROM DAY TO DAY WELL IT SO HAPPENS THAT WE HAVE A SINGULAR BODY WE HAVE ONE BODY NOT TWO NOT THREE AND SO THAT IS A BEGINNING THERE IS JUST ONE REFERENCE POINT WHICH IS THE BODY BUT THEN OF COURSE THE BODY HAS MANY PARTS AND THINGS GROW AT DIFFERENT RATES AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT SIZES AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE
AntonioDamasio_2011 HOWEVER NOT SO WITH THE INTERIOR
AntonioDamasio_2011 THE THINGS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT IS KNOWN AS OUR INTERNAL MILIEU FOR EXAMPLE THE WHOLE MANAGEMENT OF THE CHEMISTRIES WITHIN OUR BODY ARE IN FACT EXTREMELY MAINTAINED DAY AFTER DAY FOR ONE VERY GOOD REASON IF
AntonioDamasio_2011 YOU DEVIATE TOO MUCH IN THE PARAMETERS THAT ARE CLOSE TO THE MIDLINE OF THAT LIFE PERMITTING SURVIVAL RANGE
AntonioDamasio_2011 YOU GO INTO DISEASE OR DEATH SO WE HAVE AN IN BUILT SYSTEM WITHIN OUR OWN LIVES
AntonioDamasio_2011 AND THE FINAL THING IS THAT THERE IS A VERY TIGHT COUPLING BETWEEN THE REGULATION OF OUR BODY WITHIN THE BRAIN
AntonioDamasio_2011 AND THE BODY ITSELF UNLIKE ANY OTHER COUPLING SO FOR EXAMPLE I 'M MAKING IMAGES OF YOU BUT THERE 'S NO
AntonioDamasio_2011 LOOK AT THE REGION THERE THERE IS THE BRAIN
AntonioDamasio_2011 IN THE UPPER PART OF THE BRAIN STEM IF YOU DAMAGE THAT AS A RESULT OF A STROKE FOR EXAMPLE WHAT YOU GET IS COMA OR VEGETATIVE STATE WHICH IS A STATE OF COURSE IN WHICH YOUR MIND DISAPPEARS YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS DISAPPEARS
AntonioDamasio_2011 WHAT HAPPENS THEN ACTUALLY IS THAT YOU LOSE THE GROUNDING OF THE SELF YOU HAVE NO LONGER ACCESS TO ANY FEELING OF YOUR OWN EXISTENCE
AntonioDamasio_2011 AND IN FACT THERE CAN BE IMAGES GOING ON BEING FORMED IN THE CEREBRAL CORTEX EXCEPT YOU DON 'T KNOW THEY 'RE THERE
AntonioDamasio_2011 YOU HAVE IN EFFECT LOST CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN YOU HAVE DAMAGE TO THAT RED SECTION OF THE BRAIN STEM BUT IF YOU CONSIDER THE GREEN PART OF THE BRAIN STEM NOTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENS IT IS THAT SPECIFIC
AntonioDamasio_2011 SO IN THAT GREEN COMPONENT OF THE BRAIN STEM IF YOU DAMAGE IT AND OFTEN IT HAPPENS
AntonioDamasio_2011 WHAT YOU GET IS COMPLETE PARALYSIS
AntonioDamasio_2011 BUT YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND IS MAINTAINED
AntonioDamasio_2011 YOU FEEL YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A FULLY CONSCIOUS MIND THAT YOU CAN REPORT VERY INDIRECTLY THIS IS A HORRIFIC CONDITION
AntonioDamasio_2011 YOU DON 'T WANT TO SEE IT AND PEOPLE ARE IN FACT IMPRISONED WITHIN THEIR OWN BODIES BUT THEY DO HAVE A MIND THERE WAS A VERY INTERESTING FILM ONE OF THE RARE GOOD FILMS DONE ABOUT A SITUATION LIKE THIS
AntonioDamasio_2011 BY JULIAN SCHNABEL SOME YEARS AGO ABOUT A PATIENT THAT WAS IN THAT CONDITION SO NOW I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A PICTURE I PROMISE NOT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS EXCEPT THIS IS TO FRIGHTEN YOU IT 'S JUST TO TELL YOU THAT IN THAT RED SECTION
AntonioDamasio_2011 BRAIN MAPS OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OUR INTERIOR DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OUR BODY
AntonioDamasio_2011 THEY ARE EXQUISITELY TOPOGRAPHIC AND THEY ARE EXQUISITELY INTERCONNECTED IN A RECURSIVE PATTERN AND IT IS OUT OF THIS AND OUT OF THIS TIGHT COUPLING
AntonioDamasio_2011 BETWEEN THE BRAIN STEM AND THE BODY THAT I BELIEVE AND I COULD BE WRONG BUT I DON 'T THINK I AM THAT YOU GENERATE THIS MAPPING OF THE BODY THAT PROVIDES THE GROUNDING FOR THE SELF AND THAT COMES IN THE FORM OF FEELINGS
AntonioDamasio_2011 PRIMORDIAL FEELINGS BY THE WAY SO WHAT IS THE PICTURE THAT WE GET HERE LOOK AT CEREBRAL CORTEX LOOK AT BRAIN STEM LOOK AT BODY AND YOU GET THE PICTURE OF THE INTERCONNECTIVITY IN WHICH YOU HAVE THE BRAIN STEM PROVIDING THE GROUNDING FOR THE SELF IN A VERY TIGHT INTERCONNECTION WITH THE BODY
AntonioDamasio_2011 AND YOU HAVE THE CEREBRAL CORTEX PROVIDING THE GREAT SPECTACLE OF OUR MINDS WITH THE PROFUSION OF IMAGES THAT ARE IN FACT THE CONTENTS OF OUR MINDS AND THAT WE NORMALLY PAY MOST ATTENTION TO AS WE SHOULD BECAUSE THAT 'S REALLY THE FILM THAT IS ROLLING IN OUR MINDS
AntonioDamasio_2011 CORTEX AND BRAIN STEM YOU CANNOT HAVE A CONSCIOUS MIND IF YOU DON 'T HAVE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE BRAIN STEM AND THE BODY ANOTHER THING THAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT THE BRAIN STEM THAT WE HAVE IS SHARED WITH A VARIETY OF OTHER SPECIES
AntonioDamasio_2011 SO THROUGHOUT VERTEBRATES THE DESIGN OF THE BRAIN STEM IS VERY SIMILAR TO OURS
AntonioDamasio_2011 WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I THINK THOSE OTHER SPECIES HAVE CONSCIOUS MINDS LIKE WE DO EXCEPT THAT THEY 'RE NOT AS RICH AS OURS BECAUSE THEY DON 'T HAVE A CEREBRAL CORTEX LIKE WE DO THAT 'S WHERE THE DIFFERENCE IS AND I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THE IDEA
AntonioDamasio_2011 THAT CONSCIOUSNESS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS THE GREAT PRODUCT OF THE CEREBRAL CORTEX ONLY THE WEALTH OF OUR MINDS IS NOT THE VERY FACT THAT WE HAVE A SELF THAT WE CAN REFER TO OUR OWN EXISTENCE AND THAT WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF PERSON
AntonioDamasio_2011 NOW THERE ARE THREE LEVELS OF SELF TO CONSIDER THE PROTO THE CORE AND THE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL THE FIRST TWO ARE SHARED WITH MANY MANY OTHER SPECIES
AntonioDamasio_2011 AND THEY ARE REALLY COMING OUT LARGELY OF THE BRAIN STEM AND WHATEVER THERE IS OF CORTEX IN THOSE SPECIES IT 'S THE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SELF WHICH SOME SPECIES HAVE I THINK CETACEANS AND PRIMATES HAVE
AntonioDamasio_2011 ALSO AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SELF TO A CERTAIN DEGREE AND EVERYBODY 'S DOGS AT HOME HAVE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SELF TO A CERTAIN DEGREE BUT THE NOVELTY IS HERE THE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SELF IS BUILT ON THE BASIS OF PAST MEMORIES AND MEMORIES OF THE PLANS THAT WE HAVE MADE IT 'S THE LIVED PAST AND THE ANTICIPATED FUTURE
AntonioDamasio_2011 AND THE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SELF HAS PROMPTED EXTENDED MEMORY REASONING IMAGINATION CREATIVITY AND LANGUAGE AND OUT OF THAT CAME THE INSTRUMENTS OF CULTURE
AntonioDamasio_2011 RELIGIONS JUSTICE TRADE THE ARTS SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND IT IS WITHIN THAT CULTURE THAT WE REALLY CAN GET AND THIS IS THE NOVELTY SOMETHING THAT IS NOT
AntonioDamasio_2011 ENTIRELY SET BY OUR BIOLOGY IT IS DEVELOPED IN THE CULTURES IT DEVELOPED IN COLLECTIVES OF HUMAN BEINGS AND THIS IS OF COURSE THE CULTURE WHERE WE HAVE DEVELOPED SOMETHING THAT I LIKE TO CALL SOCIO CULTURAL REGULATION
AntonioDamasio_2011 AND FINALLY YOU COULD RIGHTLY ASK WHY CARE ABOUT THIS WHY CARE IF IT IS THE BRAIN STEM OR THE CEREBRAL CORTEX AND HOW THIS IS MADE THREE REASONS FIRST CURIOSITY
AntonioDamasio_2011 PRIMATES ARE EXTREMELY CURIOUS AND HUMANS MOST OF ALL AND
AntonioDamasio_2011 OF HUMANKIND ARE DISEASES SUCH AS DEPRESSION ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE
AntonioDamasio_2011 DRUG ADDICTION THINK OF STROKES THAT CAN DEVASTATE YOUR MIND OR RENDER YOU UNCONSCIOUS YOU HAVE NO PRAYER OF TREATING THOSE DISEASES EFFECTIVELY AND IN A NON SERENDIPITOUS WAY IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW THIS WORKS SO THAT 'S A VERY GOOD REASON
