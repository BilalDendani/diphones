AdamDavidson_2012S@38.76:51.76 ANGRY NEGOTIATIONS NEGOTIATIONS BREAKING APART REPORTS OF PHONE CALLS THAT AREN 'T GOING WELL PEOPLE SAYING NOTHING 'S HAPPENING AT ALL AND THEN SOMETIME AROUND CHRISTMAS OR NEW YEAR 'S WE 'RE GOING TO HEAR OKAY THEY RESOLVED EVERYTHING
AdamDavidson_2012S@51.76:56.12 HE TOLD ME THAT A FEW MONTHS AGO HE SAID HE 'S NINETY EIGHT PERCENT POSITIVE THEY 'RE GOING TO RESOLVE IT
AdamDavidson_2012S@56.12:64.04 AND I GOT AN EMAIL FROM HIM TODAY SAYING ALL RIGHT WE 'RE BASICALLY ON TRACK BUT NOW I 'M EIGHTY PERCENT POSITIVE THAT THEY 'RE GOING TO RESOLVE IT
AdamDavidson_2012S@64.04:76.14 AND IT MADE ME THINK I LOVE STUDYING THESE MOMENTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHEN THERE WAS THIS FRENZY OF PARTISAN ANGER THAT THE ECONOMY WAS ON THE VERGE OF TOTAL COLLAPSE
AdamDavidson_2012S@76.14:92.99 THE MOST FAMOUS EARLY BATTLE WAS ALEXANDER HAMILTON AND THOMAS JEFFERSON OVER WHAT THE DOLLAR WOULD BE AND HOW IT WOULD BE BACKED UP WITH ALEXANDER HAMILTON SAYING WE NEED A CENTRAL BANK THE FIRST BANK OF THE UNITED STATES OR ELSE THE DOLLAR WILL HAVE NO VALUE THIS ECONOMY WON 'T WORK AND
AdamDavidson_2012S@92.99:110.32 THOMAS JEFFERSON SAYING THE PEOPLE WON 'T TRUST THAT THEY JUST FOUGHT OFF A KING THEY 'RE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT SOME CENTRAL AUTHORITY THIS BATTLE DEFINED THE FIRST ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS OF THE U S ECONOMY AND AT EVERY MOMENT DIFFERENT PARTISANS SAYING OH MY GOD THE ECONOMY 'S ABOUT TO COLLAPSE
AdamDavidson_2012S@114.73:126.9 TO GIVE YOU A QUICK PRIMER ON WHERE WE ARE A QUICK REFRESHER ON WHERE WE ARE SO THE FISCAL CLIFF I WAS TOLD THAT THAT 'S TOO PARTISAN A THING TO SAY ALTHOUGH I CAN 'T REMEMBER WHICH PARTY
AdamDavidson_2012S@126.9:135.39 IT 'S SUPPORTING OR ATTACKING PEOPLE SAY WE SHOULD CALL IT THE FISCAL SLOPE OR WE SHOULD CALL IT AN AUSTERITY CRISIS BUT THEN OTHER PEOPLE SAY NO THAT 'S EVEN MORE PARTISAN
AdamDavidson_2012S@135.39:142.77 SO I JUST CALL IT THE SELF IMPOSED SELF DESTRUCTIVE ARBITRARY DEADLINE ABOUT RESOLVING AN INEVITABLE PROBLEM
AdamDavidson_2012S@153.4:171.62 THE LIGHT BLUE DOTTED LINE REPRESENTS THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE 'S BEST GUESS OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF CONGRESS REALLY DOESN 'T DO ANYTHING AND AS YOU CAN SEE SOMETIME AROUND TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY SEVEN WE REACH GREEK LEVELS OF DEBT SOMEWHERE AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PERCENT OF GDP
AdamDavidson_2012S@171.62:183.02 WHICH TELLS YOU THAT SOME TIME IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS IF CONGRESS DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WE 'RE GOING TO HIT A MOMENT WHERE THE WORLD 'S INVESTORS THE WORLD 'S BOND BUYERS ARE GOING TO SAY WE DON
AdamDavidson_2012S@205.26:209 HERE 'S ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM
AdamDavidson_2012S@209:224.85 THE DARK BLUE LINE IS HOW MUCH THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS THE LIGHT BLUE LINE IS HOW MUCH THE GOVERNMENT GETS IN AND AS YOU CAN SEE FOR MOST OF RECENT HISTORY EXCEPT FOR A BRIEF PERIOD WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY SPENT MORE THAN WE TAKE IN THUS THE NATIONAL DEBT
AdamDavidson_2012S@237.42:239.82 AND THIRTY AND THIS GRAPH SORT OF SUMS UP
AdamDavidson_2012S@239.82:251.13 WHAT THE PROBLEM IS THE DEMOCRATS THEY SAY WELL THIS ISN 'T A BIG DEAL WE CAN JUST RAISE TAXES A BIT AND CLOSE THAT GAP ESPECIALLY IF WE RAISE TAXES ON THE RICH
AdamDavidson_2012S@251.13:265.16 THE REPUBLICANS SAY HEY NO NO WE 'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA WHY DON 'T WE LOWER BOTH LINES WHY DON 'T WE LOWER GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND LOWER GOVERNMENT TAXES AND THEN WE 'LL BE ON AN EVEN MORE FAVORABLE LONG TERM DEFICIT TRAJECTORY
AdamDavidson_2012S@265.16:282.46 AND BEHIND THIS POWERFUL DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN HOW TO CLOSE THAT GAP THERE 'S THE WORST KIND OF CYNICAL PARTY POLITICS THE WORST KIND OF INSIDER BASEBALL LOBBYING ALL OF THAT STUFF BUT THERE 'S ALSO THIS
AdamDavidson_2012S@282.47:293.44 POWERFULLY INTERESTING RESPECTFUL DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT ECONOMIC PHILOSOPHIES AND I LIKE TO THINK
AdamDavidson_2012S@293.44:298.61 WHEN I PICTURE HOW REPUBLICANS SEE THE ECONOMY WHAT I PICTURE IS
AdamDavidson_2012S@298.61:309.93 JUST SOME AMAZINGLY WELL ENGINEERED MACHINE SOME PERFECT MACHINE UNFORTUNATELY I PICTURE IT MADE IN GERMANY OR JAPAN BUT THIS AMAZING MACHINE THAT
AdamDavidson_2012S@325.64:335.59 BUILDS UP THE MORE PRODUCTIVE AREAS AND LETS THE LESS PRODUCTIVE AREAS FADE AWAY AND DIE AND AS A RESULT THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS SO MUCH MORE EFFICIENT SO MUCH RICHER FOR EVERYBODY
AdamDavidson_2012S@335.59:353.77 AND THIS VIEW GENERALLY BELIEVES THAT THERE IS A ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT A SMALL ROLE TO SET THE RULES SO PEOPLE AREN 'T LYING AND CHEATING AND HURTING EACH OTHER MAYBE YOU KNOW HAVE A POLICE FORCE AND A FIRE DEPARTMENT AND AN ARMY BUT TO HAVE A VERY LIMITED REACH INTO THE MECHANISMS OF THIS MACHINERY
AdamDavidson_2012S@353.77:373.13 AND WHEN I PICTURE HOW DEMOCRATS AND DEMOCRATIC LEANING ECONOMISTS PICTURE THIS ECONOMY MOST DEMOCRATIC ECONOMISTS ARE YOU KNOW THEY 'RE CAPITALISTS THEY BELIEVE YES THAT 'S A GOOD SYSTEM A LOT OF THE TIME IT 'S GOOD TO LET MARKETS MOVE RESOURCES TO THEIR MORE PRODUCTIVE USE BUT THAT SYSTEM HAS TONS OF PROBLEMS
AdamDavidson_2012S@388.81:393.17 THAT MAKE THIS LIFE WORSE FOR ALL OF US AND SO THE GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE A ROLE
AdamDavidson_2012S@393.17:400.43 TO TAKE RESOURCES FROM MORE PRODUCTIVE USES OR FROM RICHER SOURCES AND GIVE THEM TO OTHER SOURCES
AdamDavidson_2012S@400.43:404.95 AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE ECONOMY THROUGH THESE TWO DIFFERENT LENSES
AdamDavidson_2012S@404.95:419.69 YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THIS CRISIS IS SO HARD TO SOLVE BECAUSE THE WORSE THE CRISIS GETS THE HIGHER THE STAKES ARE THE MORE EACH SIDE THINKS THEY KNOW THE ANSWER AND THE OTHER SIDE IS JUST GOING TO RUIN EVERYTHING
AdamDavidson_2012S@419.69:435.5 AND I CAN GET REALLY DESPAIRING I 'VE SPENT A LOT OF THE LAST FEW YEARS REALLY DEPRESSED ABOUT THIS UNTIL THIS YEAR I LEARNED SOMETHING THAT I FELT REALLY EXCITED ABOUT I FEEL LIKE IT 'S REALLY GOOD NEWS AND IT 'S SO SHOCKING I DON 'T LIKE SAYING IT BECAUSE I THINK
AdamDavidson_2012S@435.5:453.47 PEOPLE WON 'T BELIEVE ME BUT HERE 'S WHAT I LEARNED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TAKEN AS A WHOLE WHEN IT COMES TO THESE ISSUES TO FISCAL ISSUES ARE MODERATE PRAGMATIC CENTRISTS AND I KNOW THAT 'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE MODERATE PRAGMATIC CENTRISTS BUT LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT I 'M THINKING
AdamDavidson_2012S@453.47:459.09 WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDS MONEY SO THIS IS THE BATTLE RIGHT HERE
AdamDavidson_2012S@459.09:470.92 FIFTY FIVE PERCENT MORE THAN HALF IS ON SOCIAL SECURITY MEDICARE MEDICAID A FEW OTHER HEALTH PROGRAMS TWENTY PERCENT DEFENSE NINETEEN PERCENT DISCRETIONARY AND SIX PERCENT INTEREST SO
AdamDavidson_2012S@471.2:485.7 WHEN WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT CUTTING GOVERNMENT SPENDING THIS IS THE PIE WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT AND AMERICANS OVERWHELMINGLY AND IT DOESN 'T MATTER WHAT PARTY THEY 'RE IN OVERWHELMINGLY LIKE THAT BIG FIFTY FIVE PERCENT CHUNK
AdamDavidson_2012S@485.7:493.52 THEY LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY THEY LIKE MEDICARE THEY EVEN LIKE MEDICAID EVEN THOUGH THAT GOES TO THE POOR AND INDIGENT WHICH YOU MIGHT THINK WOULD HAVE LESS SUPPORT
AdamDavidson_2012S@493.52:501.88 AND THEY DO NOT WANT IT FUNDAMENTALLY TOUCHED ALTHOUGH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE REMARKABLY COMFORTABLE
AdamDavidson_2012S@501.88:521.07 AND DEMOCRATS ROUGHLY EQUAL TO REPUBLICANS WITH SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO MAKE THE SYSTEM MORE STABLE SOCIAL SECURITY IS FAIRLY EASY TO FIX THE RUMORS OF ITS DEMISE ARE ALWAYS GREATLY EXAGGERATED SO GRADUALLY RAISE SOCIAL SECURITY RETIREMENT AGE MAYBE ONLY ON PEOPLE NOT YET BORN
AdamDavidson_2012S@521.07:532.57 AMERICANS ARE ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY WHETHER THEY 'RE DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS REDUCE MEDICARE FOR VERY WEALTHY SENIORS SENIORS WHO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY DON 'T EVEN ELIMINATE IT JUST REDUCE IT PEOPLE GENERALLY ARE
AdamDavidson_2012S@550.86:563.6 WE ARE NOT A NATION THAT 'S POWERFULLY DIVIDED ON THE MAJOR MAJOR ISSUE WE 'RE COMFORTABLE WITH IT NEEDING SOME TWEAKS BUT WE WANT TO KEEP IT WE 'RE NOT OPEN TO A DISCUSSION OF ELIMINATING IT
AdamDavidson_2012S@563.6:582.91 NOW THERE IS ONE ISSUE THAT IS HYPER PARTISAN AND WHERE THERE IS ONE PARTY THAT IS JUST SPEND SPEND SPEND WE DON 'T CARE SPEND SOME MORE AND THAT OF COURSE IS REPUBLICANS WHEN IT COMES TO MILITARY DEFENSE SPENDING THEY WAY OUTWEIGH DEMOCRATS THE VAST MAJORITY WANT TO PROTECT
AdamDavidson_2012S@582.91:586.52 MILITARY DEFENSE SPENDING THAT 'S TWENTY PERCENT OF THE BUDGET
AdamDavidson_2012S@586.52:590.44 AND THAT PRESENTS A MORE DIFFICULT ISSUE
AdamDavidson_2012S@590.44:606.74 I SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING WHICH IS ABOUT NINETEEN PERCENT OF THE BUDGET THAT IS DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN ISSUES SO YOU DO HAVE WELFARE FOOD STAMPS OTHER PROGRAMS THAT TEND TO BE POPULAR AMONG DEMOCRATS BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THE FARM BILL AND ALL SORTS OF DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR INDUCEMENTS FOR
AdamDavidson_2012S@606.74:611.28 OIL DRILLING AND OTHER THINGS WHICH TEND TO BE POPULAR AMONG REPUBLICANS
AdamDavidson_2012S@611.28:626.14 NOW WHEN IT COMES TO TAXES THERE IS MORE DISAGREEMENT THAT 'S A MORE PARTISAN AREA YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTIVE OF RAISING THE INCOME TAX ON PEOPLE WHO MAKE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR REPUBLICANS
AdamDavidson_2012S@626.14:638.64 SORT OF AGAINST IT ALTHOUGH IF YOU BREAK IT OUT BY INCOME REPUBLICANS WHO MAKE LESS THAN SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR LIKE THIS IDEA SO BASICALLY REPUBLICANS WHO MAKE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR DON 'T WANT TO BE TAXED
AdamDavidson_2012S@638.64:647.38 RAISING TAXES ON INVESTMENT INCOME YOU ALSO SEE ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF DEMOCRATS BUT ONLY ONE THIRD OF REPUBLICANS ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT IDEA
AdamDavidson_2012S@647.38:658.46 THIS BRINGS UP A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT WHICH IS THAT WE TEND IN THIS COUNTRY TO TALK ABOUT DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND THINK THERE 'S THIS LITTLE GROUP OVER THERE CALLED INDEPENDENTS THAT 'S WHAT TWO PERCENT
AdamDavidson_2012S@658.46:662.35 IF YOU ADD DEMOCRATS YOU ADD REPUBLICANS YOU 'VE GOT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
AdamDavidson_2012S@662.35:679.07 BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL AND IT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE FOR MOST OF MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY ROUGHLY A THIRD OF AMERICANS SAY THAT THEY ARE DEMOCRATS AROUND A QUARTER SAY THAT THEY ARE REPUBLICANS A TINY LITTLE SLIVER
AdamDavidson_2012S@679.07:684.1 CALL THEMSELVES LIBERTARIANS OR SOCIALISTS OR SOME OTHER SMALL THIRD PARTY
AdamDavidson_2012S@684.1:703.62 AND THE LARGEST BLOCK FORTY PERCENT SAY THEY 'RE INDEPENDENTS SO MOST AMERICANS ARE NOT PARTISAN AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE INDEPENDENT CAMP FALL SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN SO EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE TREMENDOUS OVERLAP BETWEEN THE VIEWS ON THESE FISCAL ISSUES OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
AdamDavidson_2012S@703.62:708.35 WE HAVE EVEN MORE OVERLAP WHEN YOU ADD IN THE INDEPENDENTS
AdamDavidson_2012S@708.35:715.43 NOW WE GET TO FIGHT ABOUT ALL SORTS OF OTHER ISSUES WE GET TO HATE EACH OTHER ON GUN CONTROL AND ABORTION AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AdamDavidson_2012S@715.43:729.67 BUT ON THESE FISCAL ISSUES THESE IMPORTANT FISCAL ISSUES WE JUST ARE NOT ANYWHERE NEARLY AS DIVIDED AS PEOPLE SAY AND IN FACT THERE 'S THIS OTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AS DIVIDED AS PEOPLE MIGHT THINK AND THAT GROUP IS ECONOMISTS
AdamDavidson_2012S@729.67:733.12 I TALK TO A LOT OF ECONOMISTS AND
AdamDavidson_2012S@750.1:757.28 YOU WERE A FREE MARKET CAPITALIST ECONOMIST OR YOU WERE A KEYNESIAN LIBERAL ECONOMIST AND THESE PEOPLE DIDN 'T GO TO EACH OTHER 'S WEDDINGS
AdamDavidson_2012S@761.32:775.65 BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE IT IS REALLY REALLY HARD TO FIND AN ECONOMIST UNDER FORTY WHO STILL HAS THAT KIND OF WAY OF SEEING THE WORLD THE VAST MAJORITY OF ECONOMISTS IT IS SO UNCOOL TO CALL YOURSELF AN IDEOLOGUE OF EITHER CAMP
AdamDavidson_2012S@775.65:785.46 THE PHRASE THAT YOU WANT IF YOU 'RE A GRADUATE STUDENT OR A POSTDOC OR YOU 'RE A PROFESSOR A THIRTY EIGHT YEAR OLD ECONOMICS PROFESSOR IS I 'M AN EMPIRICIST I GO BY THE DATA
AdamDavidson_2012S@785.46:804.97 AND THE DATA IS VERY CLEAR NONE OF THESE MAJOR THEORIES HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY SUCCESSFUL THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS IS RIDDLED WITH DISASTROUS EXAMPLES OF TIMES THAT ONE SCHOOL OR THE OTHER TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PAST OR PREDICT THE FUTURE AND JUST DID AN AWFUL AWFUL JOB SO
AdamDavidson_2012S@804.97:809.73 THE ECONOMICS PROFESSION HAS ACQUIRED SOME DEGREE OF MODESTY
AdamDavidson_2012S@809.73:822.7 THEY STILL ARE AN AWFULLY ARROGANT GROUP OF PEOPLE I WILL ASSURE YOU BUT THEY 'RE NOW ARROGANT ABOUT THEIR IMPARTIALITY AND THEY TOO SEE A TREMENDOUS RANGE OF POTENTIAL OUTCOMES
AdamDavidson_2012S@822.7:833.42 AND THIS NONPARTISANSHIP IS SOMETHING THAT EXISTS THAT HAS EXISTED IN SECRET IN AMERICA FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS I 'VE SPENT A LOT OF THE FALL
AdamDavidson_2012S@833.42:844.83 TALKING TO THE THREE MAJOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT SURVEY AMERICAN POLITICAL ATTITUDES PEW RESEARCH THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO 'S NATIONAL OPINION RESEARCH CENTER AND
AdamDavidson_2012S@869.13:885.26 SUPPORT NO WE MUSTN 'T TAX AND WE MUST LIMIT THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT OR NO WE MUST ENCOURAGE GOVERNMENT TO PLAY A LARGER ROLE IN REDISTRIBUTION AND CORRECTING THE ILLS OF CAPITALISM THOSE GROUPS ARE VERY VERY SMALL THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE
AdamDavidson_2012S@885.26:891.53 THEY PICK AND CHOOSE THEY SEE COMPROMISE AND THEY CHANGE OVER TIME WHEN THEY HEAR A BETTER ARGUMENT OR A WORSE ARGUMENT
AdamDavidson_2012S@891.53:901.41 AND THAT PART OF IT HAS NOT CHANGED WHAT HAS CHANGED IS HOW PEOPLE RESPOND TO VAGUE QUESTIONS IF YOU ASK PEOPLE VAGUE QUESTIONS LIKE
AdamDavidson_2012S@901.41:905.63 DO YOU THINK THERE SHOULD BE MORE GOVERNMENT OR LESS GOVERNMENT DO YOU THINK GOVERNMENT
AdamDavidson_2012S@905.63:922.49 SHOULD ESPECIALLY IF YOU USE LOADED LANGUAGE DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD PROVIDE HANDOUTS OR DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REDISTRIBUTE THEN YOU CAN SEE RADICAL PARTISAN CHANGE BUT WHEN YOU GET SPECIFIC WHEN YOU ACTUALLY ASK ABOUT THE ACTUAL TAXING AND SPENDING ISSUES UNDER CONSIDERATION
AdamDavidson_2012S@922.49:928.04 PEOPLE ARE REMARKABLY CENTRIST THEY 'RE REMARKABLY OPEN TO COMPROMISE
AdamDavidson_2012S@928.04:933.67 SO WHAT WE HAVE THEN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE FISCAL CLIFF DON 'T THINK OF IT AS
AdamDavidson_2012S@933.67:942.71 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FUNDAMENTALLY CAN 'T STAND EACH OTHER ON THESE ISSUES AND THAT WE MUST BE RIPPED APART INTO TWO SEPARATE WARRING NATIONS
AdamDavidson_2012S@942.71:948.56 THINK OF IT AS A TINY TINY NUMBER OF ANCIENT ECONOMISTS
AdamDavidson_2012S@948.56:960.23 AND MISREPRESENTATIVE IDEOLOGUES HAVE CAPTURED THE PROCESS AND THEY 'VE CAPTURED THE PROCESS THROUGH FAMILIAR WAYS THROUGH A PRIMARY SYSTEM WHICH ENCOURAGES THAT SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE 'S VOICES
AdamDavidson_2012S@960.23:974.18 BECAUSE THAT SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE THE PEOPLE WHO ANSWER ALL YESES OR ALL NOES ON THOSE IDEOLOGICAL QUESTIONS THEY MIGHT BE SMALL BUT EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS A BLOG EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN ON FOX OR MSNBC IN THE LAST WEEK
AdamDavidson_2012S@974.18:981.96 EVERY ONE OF THEM BECOMES A LOUDER AND LOUDER VOICE BUT THEY DON 'T REPRESENT US THEY DON 'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
AdamDavidson_2012S@981.96:990.78 AND THAT GETS ME BACK TO THE DOLLAR AND IT GETS ME BACK TO REMINDING MYSELF THAT WE KNOW THIS EXPERIENCE WE KNOW WHAT IT 'S LIKE
AdamDavidson_2012S@990.78:1006.04 TO HAVE THESE PEOPLE ON TV IN CONGRESS YELLING ABOUT HOW THE END OF THE WORLD IS COMING IF WE DON 'T ADOPT THEIR VIEW COMPLETELY BECAUSE IT 'S HAPPENED ABOUT THE DOLLAR EVER SINCE THERE 'S BEEN A DOLLAR
AdamDavidson_2012S@1006.04:1016.09 WE HAD THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND HAMILTON IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN WE HAD THIS UGLY BATTLE OVER THE FEDERAL RESERVE WHEN IT WAS CREATED WITH
AdamDavidson_2012S@1016.09:1029.68 VICIOUS ANGRY ARGUMENTS OVER HOW IT WOULD BE CONSTITUTED AND A GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT THE WAY IT WAS CONSTITUTED WAS THE WORST POSSIBLE COMPROMISE A COMPROMISE GUARANTEED TO DESTROY THIS VALUABLE THING THIS DOLLAR
AdamDavidson_2012S@1029.68:1035.73 BUT THEN EVERYONE AGREEING OKAY SO LONG AS WE 'RE ON THE GOLD STANDARD IT SHOULD BE OKAY THE FED CAN 'T MESS IT UP SO BADLY
AdamDavidson_2012S@1035.73:1051.68 BUT THEN WE GOT OFF THE GOLD STANDARD FOR INDIVIDUALS DURING THE DEPRESSION AND WE GOT OFF THE GOLD STANDARD AS A SOURCE OF INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY COORDINATION DURING RICHARD NIXON 'S PRESIDENCY EACH OF THOSE TIMES WE WERE ON THE VERGE OF COMPLETE COLLAPSE
AdamDavidson_2012S@1051.68:1069.15 AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL THROUGHOUT IT ALL THE DOLLAR HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST LONG STANDING STABLE REASONABLE CURRENCIES AND WE ALL USE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY NO MATTER WHAT THE PEOPLE SCREAMING ABOUT TELL US NO MATTER HOW SCARED WE 'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
AdamDavidson_2012S@1069.15:1079.98 AND THIS LONG TERM FISCAL PICTURE THAT WE 'RE IN RIGHT NOW I THINK WHAT IS MOST MADDENING ABOUT IT IS IF CONGRESS WERE SIMPLY ABLE
AdamDavidson_2012S@1080.55:1095.48 TO SHOW NOT THAT THEY AGREE WITH EACH OTHER NOT THAT THEY 'RE ABLE TO COME UP WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE COMPROMISE BUT THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO JUST BEGIN THE PROCESS TOWARDS COMPROMISE WE ALL INSTANTLY ARE BETTER OFF THE FEAR
AdamDavidson_2012S@1110.78:1117.37 AND THE LONGER WE PUT THAT OFF THE MORE WE MAKE THE WORLD NERVOUS THE HIGHER INTEREST RATES ARE GOING TO BE THE QUICKER WE 'RE GOING TO
AdamDavidson_2012S@1117.37:1134.09 HAVE TO FACE A DAY OF HORRIBLE CALAMITY AND SO JUST THE ACT OF COMPROMISE ITSELF AND SUSTAINED REAL COMPROMISE WOULD GIVE US EVEN MORE TIME WOULD ALLOW BOTH SIDES EVEN LONGER TO SPREAD OUT THE PAIN AND REACH EVEN MORE COMPROMISE DOWN THE ROAD
AdamDavidson_2012S@1134.09:1152.89 SO I 'M IN THE MEDIA I FEEL LIKE MY JOB TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN IS TO HELP FOSTER THE THINGS THAT SEEM TO LEAD TO COMPROMISE TO NOT TALK ABOUT THIS IN THOSE VAGUE AND SCARY TERMS THAT DO POLARIZE US BUT TO JUST TALK ABOUT IT LIKE WHAT IT IS NOT AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS NOT SOME
AdamDavidson_2012S@1152.89:1164.95 BATTLE BETWEEN TWO FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT RELIGIOUS VIEWS BUT A MATH PROBLEM A REALLY SOLVABLE MATH PROBLEM ONE WHERE WE 'RE NOT ALL GOING TO GET WHAT WE WANT AND ONE WHERE YOU KNOW THERE 'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE PAIN TO SPREAD AROUND
