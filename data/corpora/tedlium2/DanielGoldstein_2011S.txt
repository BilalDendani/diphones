DanielGoldstein_2011S YOU REMEMBER THE STORY OF ODYSSEUS AND THE SIRENS FROM HIGH SCHOOL OR JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL THERE WAS THIS HERO ODYSSEUS WHO 'S HEADING BACK
DanielGoldstein_2011S HOME AFTER THE TROJAN WAR
DanielGoldstein_2011S WE WILL SAIL PAST THOSE ROCKS AND ON THOSE ROCKS SIT SOME BEAUTIFUL WOMEN CALLED SIRENS
DanielGoldstein_2011S AND THESE WOMEN SING AN ENCHANTING SONG A SONG SO ALLURING THAT ALL SAILORS WHO HEAR IT CRASH INTO THE ROCKS AND DIE NOW YOU WOULD EXPECT GIVEN THAT THAT THEY WOULD CHOOSE AN ALTERNATE ROUTE AROUND THE SIRENS BUT INSTEAD ODYSSEUS SAYS
DanielGoldstein_2011S I WANT TO HEAR THAT SONG
DanielGoldstein_2011S SO THIS IS A CAPTAIN PUTTING THE LIFE OF EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THE SHIP AT RISK SO THAT HE CAN HEAR A SONG AND I 'D LIKE TO THINK IF THIS WAS THE CASE THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE REHEARSED IT A FEW TIMES ODYSSEUS WOULD HAVE SAID OKAY LET 'S DO A DRY RUN YOU TIE ME TO THE MAST
DanielGoldstein_2011S HESITATES HE 'S LIKE IS THIS STILL THE REHEARSAL OR SHOULD I UNTIE HIM AND THE FIRST MATE THINKS WELL I GUESS AT SOME POINT THE REHEARSAL HAS TO END SO HE UNTIES ODYSSEUS AND ODYSSEUS FLIPS
DanielGoldstein_2011S OUT HE 'S LIKE YOU IDIOT YOU MORON IF YOU DO THAT TOMORROW I 'LL BE DEAD YOU 'LL BE DEAD EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE MEN WILL BE DEAD NOW JUST DON 'T UNTIE ME NO MATTER WHAT
DanielGoldstein_2011S TYING YOURSELF TO A MAST IS PERHAPS THE OLDEST WRITTEN EXAMPLE OF WHAT PSYCHOLOGISTS CALL A COMMITMENT DEVICE
DanielGoldstein_2011S A COMMITMENT DEVICE IS A DECISION THAT YOU MAKE WITH A COOL HEAD TO BIND YOURSELF SO THAT YOU DON 'T DO SOMETHING REGRETTABLE WHEN YOU HAVE A HOT HEAD BECAUSE THERE 'S TWO HEADS INSIDE ONE PERSON WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT
DanielGoldstein_2011S SCHOLARS HAVE LONG INVOKED THIS METAPHOR OF TWO SELVES WHEN IT COMES TO QUESTIONS OF TEMPTATION THERE IS FIRST THE PRESENT SELF THIS IS LIKE ODYSSEUS WHEN HE 'S HEARING THE SONG
DanielGoldstein_2011S HE JUST WANTS TO GET TO THE FRONT ROW HE JUST THINKS ABOUT THE HERE AND NOW AND THE IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION BUT THEN THERE 'S THIS OTHER SELF THE FUTURE SELF THIS IS ODYSSEUS AS AN OLD MAN WHO WANTS NOTHING MORE THAN TO RETIRE IN A SUNNY VILLA WITH HIS WIFE PENELOPE OUTSIDE OF ITHACA THE OTHER ONE
DanielGoldstein_2011S SO WHY DO WE NEED COMMITMENT DEVICES WELL
DanielGoldstein_2011S RESISTING TEMPTATION IS HARD AS THE NINETEENTH CENTURY ENGLISH ECONOMIST NASSAU WILLIAM SENIOR SAID TO ABSTAIN FROM THE ENJOYMENT WHICH IS IN OUR POWER
DanielGoldstein_2011S OR TO SEEK DISTANT RATHER THAN IMMEDIATE RESULTS ARE AMONG THE MOST PAINFUL EXERTIONS OF THE HUMAN WILL
DanielGoldstein_2011S IF YOU SET GOALS FOR YOURSELF AND YOU 'RE LIKE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE YOU PROBABLY REALIZE IT 'S NOT THAT YOUR GOALS ARE PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE
DanielGoldstein_2011S THE OTHER REASON THAT IT 'S DIFFICULT TO RESIST TEMPTATION IS BECAUSE
DanielGoldstein_2011S IT 'S AN UNEQUAL BATTLE BETWEEN THE PRESENT SELF AND THE FUTURE SELF I MEAN LET 'S FACE IT THE PRESENT SELF IS PRESENT IT 'S IN CONTROL IT 'S IN POWER RIGHT NOW IT HAS THESE STRONG HEROIC ARMS THAT CAN LIFT DOUGHNUTS INTO YOUR MOUTH AND THE FUTURE SELF IS NOT EVEN AROUND
DanielGoldstein_2011S IT 'S OFF IN THE FUTURE IT 'S WEAK IT DOESN 'T EVEN HAVE A LAWYER PRESENT THERE 'S NOBODY TO STICK UP FOR THE FUTURE SELF AND SO THE PRESENT SELF CAN TROUNCE ALL OVER
DanielGoldstein_2011S NOW I 'M A BIG FAN OF COMMITMENT DEVICES ACTUALLY TYING YOURSELF TO THE MAST IS THE OLDEST ONE BUT THERE ARE OTHER ONES SUCH AS LOCKING A CREDIT CARD AWAY WITH A KEY
DanielGoldstein_2011S OR NOT BRINGING JUNK FOOD INTO THE HOUSE SO YOU WON 'T EAT IT OR UNPLUGGING YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION SO YOU CAN USE YOUR COMPUTER I WAS CREATING COMMITMENT DEVICES OF MY OWN LONG BEFORE I KNEW WHAT THEY WERE SO WHEN I WAS A STARVING POST DOC AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY I WAS DEEP IN A PUBLISH OR PERISH
DanielGoldstein_2011S PHASE OF MY CAREER I HAD TO WRITE FIVE PAGES A DAY TOWARDS PAPERS OR I WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP FIVE DOLLARS
DanielGoldstein_2011S I THOUGHT OH I 'M SENDING MYSELF MIXED MESSAGES BECAUSE NOT WRITING IS BAD BUT GIVING TO CHARITY IS GOOD SO THEN I WOULD KIND OF JUSTIFY NOT WRITING BY GIVING A GIFT
DanielGoldstein_2011S AND THEN I KIND OF FLIPPED THAT AROUND AND THOUGHT WELL I COULD GIVE IT TO THE NEO NAZIS BUT THEN I WAS LIKE THAT 'S MORE BAD THAN WRITING IS GOOD AND SO THAT WOULDN 'T WORK SO ULTIMATELY I JUST DECIDED I WOULD LEAVE IT IN AN ENVELOPE ON THE SUBWAY
DanielGoldstein_2011S SO THE FIRST IS WHEN YOU 'VE GOT ONE OF THESE DEVICES GOING SUCH AS THIS CONTRACT TO WRITE EVERYDAY OR PAY IT 'S JUST A CONSTANT REMINDER THAT YOU HAVE NO SELF CONTROL
DanielGoldstein_2011S YOU 'RE JUST TELLING YOURSELF WITHOUT YOU COMMITMENT DEVICE I AM NOTHING
DanielGoldstein_2011S SO I DON 'T LIKE THE WAY THAT THEY TAKE THE POWER AWAY FROM YOU I THINK SELF DISCIPLINE IS SOMETHING IT 'S LIKE A MUSCLE THE MORE YOU EXERCISE IT THE STRONGER IT GETS
DanielGoldstein_2011S THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH COMMITMENT DEVICES IS THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS WEASEL YOUR WAY OUT OF THEM YOU SAY WELL OF COURSE I CAN 'T WRITE TODAY BECAUSE I 'M GIVING A TEDTALK AND I HAVE FIVE MEDIA INTERVIEWS AND THEN I 'M GOING TO A COCKTAIL PARTY AND THEN I 'LL BE DRUNK AFTER THAT AND SO THERE 'S NO WAY THAT THIS IS GOING TO WORK
DanielGoldstein_2011S A DECADE NOW ON FINDING OTHER WAYS TO CHANGE PEOPLE 'S RELATIONSHIP TO THE FUTURE SELF WITHOUT USING COMMITMENT DEVICES IN PARTICULAR I 'M INTERESTED IN THE RELATIONSHIP TO THE FUTURE FINANCIAL SELF
DanielGoldstein_2011S AND THIS IS A TIMELY ISSUE I 'M TALKING ABOUT THE TOPIC OF SAVING NOW SAVING IS A CLASSIC TWO SELVES PROBLEM THE PRESENT SELF DOES NOT WANT TO SAVE AT ALL IT WANTS TO CONSUME WHEREAS THE FUTURE SELF WANTS THE PRESENT SELF TO SAVE
DanielGoldstein_2011S SO WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THIS
DanielGoldstein_2011S THERE 'S A PHILOSOPHER DEREK PARFIT WHO SAID SOME WORDS THAT WERE INSPIRING TO MY COAUTHORS AND I HE SAID THAT WE MIGHT NEGLECT OUR FUTURE SELVES
DanielGoldstein_2011S BECAUSE OF SOME FAILURE OF BELIEF OR IMAGINATION
DanielGoldstein_2011S THAT IS TO SAY WE SOMEHOW MIGHT NOT BELIEVE
DanielGoldstein_2011S SO MY COAUTHORS AND I HAVE USED COMPUTERS THE GREATEST TOOL OF OUR TIME TO ASSIST PEOPLE 'S IMAGINATION AND HELP THEM IMAGINE WHAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE TO GO INTO THE FUTURE
DanielGoldstein_2011S AND I 'LL SHOW YOU SOME OF THESE TOOLS RIGHT HERE
DanielGoldstein_2011S THE FIRST IS CALLED THE DISTRIBUTION BUILDER IT SHOWS PEOPLE WHAT THE FUTURE MIGHT BE LIKE BY SHOWING THEM
DanielGoldstein_2011S BEING UP AT THE TOP MEANS THAT YOU 'RE ENJOYING A HIGH INCOME IN RETIREMENT BEING DOWN AT THE BOTTOM MEANS THAT YOU 'RE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET WHEN YOU MAKE AN INVESTMENT WHAT YOU 'RE REALLY SAYING IS I ACCEPT THAT ANY ONE OF THESE ONE HUNDRED THINGS COULD HAPPEN TO ME AND DETERMINE MY WEALTH
DanielGoldstein_2011S NOW YOU CAN TRY TO MOVE YOUR OUTCOMES AROUND YOU CAN TRY TO MANIPULATE YOUR FATE LIKE THIS PERSON IS DOING BUT IT COSTS YOU SOMETHING TO DO IT IT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE TO SAVE MORE TODAY
DanielGoldstein_2011S ONCE YOU FIND AN INVESTMENT THAT YOU 'RE HAPPY WITH WHAT PEOPLE DO IS THEY CLICK DONE AND THE MARKERS BEGIN TO DISAPPEAR SLOWLY ONE BY ONE IT SIMULATES WHAT IT IS LIKE TO INVEST IN SOMETHING AND TO WATCH THAT INVESTMENT PAN OUT AT THE END THERE WILL ONLY BE ONE MARKER LEFT STANDING AND IT WILL DETERMINE OUR WEALTH IN RETIREMENT
DanielGoldstein_2011S YES THIS PERSON RETIRED AT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT OF THEIR WORKING INCOME IN RETIREMENT THEY 'RE MAKING MORE MONEY WHILE RETIRED THAN THEY WERE MAKING WHILE THEY WERE WORKING IF YOU 'RE LIKE MOST PEOPLE
DanielGoldstein_2011S JUST SEEING THAT GAVE YOU A SMALL SENSE OF ELATION AND JOY JUST TO THINK ABOUT MAKING FIFTY PERCENT MORE MONEY IN RETIREMENT THAN BEFORE
DanielGoldstein_2011S HOWEVER HAD YOU ENDED UP ON THE VERY BOTTOM IT MIGHT HAVE GIVEN YOU
DanielGoldstein_2011S NOW PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED THROUGH EMOTIONS
DanielGoldstein_2011S BUT DIFFERENT PEOPLE FIND DIFFERENT THINGS MOTIVATING THIS IS A SIMULATION THAT USES GRAPHICS BUT OTHER PEOPLE FIND MOTIVATING WHAT MONEY CAN BUY NOT JUST NUMBERS
DanielGoldstein_2011S SO HERE I MADE A DISTRIBUTION BUILDER WHERE INSTEAD OF SHOWING NUMERICAL OUTCOMES I SHOW PEOPLE WHAT THOSE OUTCOMES WILL GET YOU IN PARTICULAR APARTMENTS THAT YOU CAN AFFORD
DanielGoldstein_2011S IF YOU 'RE RETIRING ON THREE THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH AND SO ON
DanielGoldstein_2011S AS YOU MOVE DOWN THE LADDER OF APARTMENTS YOU SEE THAT THEY GET WORSE AND WORSE SOME OF THEM LOOK LIKE PLACES I LIVED IN AS A GRADUATE STUDENT
DanielGoldstein_2011S AND AS YOU GET TO THE VERY BOTTOM YOU 'RE FACED WITH THE UNFORTUNATE REALITY THAT IF YOU DON 'T SAVE ANYTHING FOR RETIREMENT YOU WON 'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD ANY HOUSING AT ALL THOSE ARE ACTUAL PICTURES OF ACTUAL APARTMENTS RENTING FOR THAT AMOUNT AS ADVERTISED ON THE INTERNET
DanielGoldstein_2011S THE LAST THING I 'LL SHOW YOU THE LAST BEHAVIORAL TIME MACHINE IS SOMETHING THAT I CREATED WITH HAL HERSHFIELD WHO WAS INTRODUCED TO ME BY MY COAUTHOR ON A PREVIOUS PROJECT BILL SHARPE AND WHAT IT IS IS AN EXPLORATION INTO VIRTUAL
DanielGoldstein_2011S REALITY SO WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE PICTURES OF PEOPLE IN THIS CASE COLLEGE AGE PEOPLE AND WE USE SOFTWARE TO AGE THEM AND SHOW THESE PEOPLE WHAT THEY 'LL LOOK LIKE WHEN THEY 'RE SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY YEARS OLD AND WE TRY TO TEST WHETHER ACTUALLY ASSISTING YOUR IMAGINATION BY LOOKING AT THE FACE OF YOUR FUTURE SELF
DanielGoldstein_2011S CAN CHANGE YOU INVESTMENT BEHAVIOR SO THIS IS ONE OF OUR EXPERIMENTS HERE WE SEE THE FACE OF THE YOUNG SUBJECT ON THE LEFT HE 'S GIVEN A CONTROL THAT ALLOWS HIM TO ADJUST HIS SAVINGS RATE AS HE MOVES HIS SAVINGS RATE DOWN IT MEANS THAT HE 'S SAVING ZERO
DanielGoldstein_2011S WHEN IT 'S ALL THE WAY HERE AT THE LEFT YOU CAN SEE HIS CURRENT ANNUAL INCOME THIS IS THE PERCENTAGE OF HIS PAYCHECK THAT HE CAN TAKE HOME TODAY IS QUITE HIGH NINETY ONE PERCENT BUT HIS RETIREMENT INCOME IS QUITE LOW HE 'S GOING TO RETIRE ON FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF WHAT HE EARNED WHILE HE WAS WORKING
DanielGoldstein_2011S IF HE SAVES THE MAXIMUM LEGAL AMOUNT HIS RETIREMENT INCOME GOES UP BUT HE 'S UNHAPPY BECAUSE NOW HE HAS LESS MONEY ON THE LEFT HAND
DanielGoldstein_2011S SIDE TO SPEND TODAY OTHER CONDITIONS SHOW PEOPLE THE FUTURE SELF AND FROM THE FUTURE SELF 'S POINT OF VIEW EVERYTHING IS IN REVERSE IF YOU SAVE VERY LITTLE THE FUTURE SELF IS UNHAPPY
DanielGoldstein_2011S BRING THIS TO A WIDER AUDIENCE I 'VE BEEN WORKING WITH HAL AND ALLIANZ TO CREATE SOMETHING WE CALL THE BEHAVIORAL TIME MACHINE IN WHICH YOU NOT ONLY GET TO SEE YOURSELF IN THE FUTURE BUT YOU GET TO SEE ANTICIPATED EMOTIONAL REACTIONS TO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RETIREMENT WEALTH SO FOR INSTANCE
DanielGoldstein_2011S HERE IS SOMEBODY USING THE TOOL AND JUST WATCH THE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AS THEY MOVE THE SLIDER
DanielGoldstein_2011S THE YOUNGER FACE GETS HAPPIER AND HAPPIER SAVING NOTHING THE OLDER FACE IS MISERABLE AND SLOWLY SLOWLY WE 'RE BRINGING IT UP TO A MODERATE SAVINGS RATE AND THEN IT 'S A HIGH SAVINGS RATE THE YOUNGER FACE IS GETTING UNHAPPY THE OLDER FACE IS QUITE PLEASED WITH THE DECISION
DanielGoldstein_2011S WE 'RE GOING TO SEE IF THIS HAS AN EFFECT ON WHAT PEOPLE DO AND WHAT 'S NICE ABOUT IT IS IT 'S NOT SOMETHING THAT BIASING PEOPLE ACTUALLY
DanielGoldstein_2011S BECAUSE AS ONE FACE SMILES THE OTHER FACE FROWNS IT 'S NOT TELLING YOU WHICH WAY TO PUT THE SLIDER IT 'S JUST REMINDING YOU THAT YOU ARE CONNECTED TO AND LEGALLY TIED TO THIS FUTURE SELF YOUR DECISIONS TODAY ARE GOING TO DETERMINE ITS WELL BEING AND THAT 'S SOMETHING THAT 'S EASY TO FORGET
DanielGoldstein_2011S THIS USE OF VIRTUAL REALITY IS NOT JUST GOOD FOR MAKING PEOPLE LOOK OLDER THERE ARE PROGRAMS YOU CAN GET TO SEE HOW PEOPLE MIGHT LOOK IF THEY SMOKE IF THEY GET TOO MUCH EXPOSURE TO THE SUN IF THEY GAIN WEIGHT AND SO ON AND WHAT 'S GOOD IS UNLIKE
DanielGoldstein_2011S IN THE EXPERIMENTS THAT HAL AND MYSELF RAN WITH RUSS SMITH YOU DON 'T HAVE TO PROGRAM THESE BY YOURSELF
DanielGoldstein_2011S IN ORDER TO SEE THE VIRTUAL REALITY THERE ARE APPLICATIONS YOU CAN GET ON SMARTPHONES FOR JUST A FEW DOLLARS THAT DO THE SAME THING
DanielGoldstein_2011S THIS IS ACTUALLY A PICTURE OF HAL MY COAUTHOR YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE HIM FROM THE PREVIOUS DEMOS AND JUST FOR KICKS WE RAN HIS PICTURE THROUGH THE BALDING AGING AND WEIGHT GAIN SOFTWARE TO SEE HOW HE WOULD LOOK
