BarrySchuler_2008P@16.54:17.21 WHAT'S HAPPENING
BarrySchuler_2008P@18.15:26.94 AND HOW THIS REVOLUTION IS ABOUT TO CHANGE EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT THE WORLD LIFE OURSELVES
BarrySchuler_2008P@27.92:41.07 AND HOW WE THINK ABOUT THEM IF YOU SAW TWO THOUSAND AND ONE A SPACE ODYSSEY AND YOU HEARD THE BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM AND YOU SAW THE MONOLITH YOU KNOW THAT WAS ARTHUR C CLARKE 'S REPRESENTATION THAT
BarrySchuler_2008P@41.63:51.60 WE WERE AT A SEMINAL MOMENT IN THE EVOLUTION OF OUR SPECIES IN THIS CASE IT WAS PICKING UP BONES AND CREATING A TOOL USING IT AS A TOOL WHICH MEANT THAT
BarrySchuler_2008P@52.04:60.27 APES JUST SORT OF RUNNING AROUND AND EATING AND DOING EACH OTHER FIGURED OUT THEY CAN MAKE THINGS IF THEY USED A TOOL
BarrySchuler_2008P@61.49:70.63 AND THAT MOVED US TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND YOU KNOW WE IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS IN PARTICULAR HAVE SEEN THIS ACCELERATION IN KNOWLEDGE AND
BarrySchuler_2008P@87.11:93.65 IN YOUR HOME AND IN NOT JUST YOUR PC BUT IN EVERY DEVICE IN YOUR WASHING MACHINE
BarrySchuler_2008P@94.38:104.42 YOUR CELLPHONE YOU'RE WALKING AROUND YOUR CAR HAS TWELVE MICROPROCESSORS THEN WE GO ALONG AND CREATE THE INTERNET AND CONNECT THE WORLD TOGETHER WE FLATTEN THE WORLD
BarrySchuler_2008P@104.77:117.48 WE'VE SEEN SO MUCH CHANGE AND WE'VE GIVEN OURSELVES THESE TOOLS NOW THESE HIGH POWERED TOOLS THAT ARE ALLOWING US TO TURN THE LENS INWARD INTO SOMETHING THAT IS COMMON TO
BarrySchuler_2008P@117.79:119.82 ALL OF US AND THAT IS A GENOME
BarrySchuler_2008P@120.87:126.93 HOW 'S YOUR GENOME TODAY HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT LATELY HEARD ABOUT IT AT LEAST
BarrySchuler_2008P@139.55:146.35 I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND SO I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT OFF OF THE BAT YOU'VE HEARD OF DNA YOU PROBABLY STUDIED A LITTLE BIT IN BIOLOGY
BarrySchuler_2008P@146.84:155.29 A GENOME IS REALLY A DESCRIPTION FOR ALL OF THE DNA THAT IS IN A LIVING ORGANISM AND ONE THING
BarrySchuler_2008P@172.57:181.38 GENES AND CHROMOSOMES AND WHEN WATSON AND CRICK IN THE FIFTIES FIRST DECODED THIS BEAUTIFUL DOUBLE HELIX THAT WE KNOW AS
BarrySchuler_2008P@182.13:189.69 THE DNA MOLECULE VERY LONG COMPLICATED MOLECULE WE THEN STARTED ON THIS JOURNEY TO UNDERSTAND THAT
BarrySchuler_2008P@206.01:209.13 ALL OF THE DNA IN YOUR BODY HAS BEEN AROUND
BarrySchuler_2008P@210.99:217.16 SINCE THE BEGINNING OF US OF US AS CREATURES THERE IS A HISTORICAL ARCHIVE
BarrySchuler_2008P@217.94:222.42 LIVING IN YOUR GENOME IS THE HISTORY OF OUR SPECIES
BarrySchuler_2008P@222.86:233.85 AND YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEING WHERE YOU'RE FROM GOING BACK THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND THAT'S NOW STARTING TO BE UNDERSTOOD
BarrySchuler_2008P@234.34:247.69 BUT ALSO THE GENOME IS REALLY THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL IT IS THE PROGRAM IT IS THE CODE OF LIFE IT IS WHAT MAKES YOU FUNCTION IT IS WHAT MAKES EVERY ORGANISM FUNCTION
BarrySchuler_2008P@248.71:255.41 DNA IS A VERY ELEGANT MOLECULE IT'S LONG AND IT'S COMPLICATED REALLY ALL YOU HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT IT
BarrySchuler_2008P@255.79:266.75 IS THAT THERE'S FOUR LETTERS A T C G THEY REPRESENT THE NAME OF A CHEMICAL AND WITH THESE FOUR LETTERS YOU CAN CREATE A LANGUAGE
BarrySchuler_2008P@266.98:271.63 A LANGUAGE THAT CAN DESCRIBE ANYTHING AND VERY COMPLICATED THINGS
BarrySchuler_2008P@272.02:281.28 YOU KNOW THEY ARE GENERALLY PUT TOGETHER IN PAIRS CREATING A WORD OR WHAT WE CALL BASE PAIRS AND YOU WOULD YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT
BarrySchuler_2008P@282.55:294.14 LETTERS OR THE REPRESENTATION OF FOUR THINGS MAKES US WORK AND THAT MAY NOT SOUND VERY INTUITIVE BUT LET ME FLIP OVER TO SOMETHING ELSE YOU KNOW ABOUT AND THAT'S COMPUTERS
BarrySchuler_2008P@294.49:302.04 LOOK AT THIS SCREEN HERE AND YOU KNOW YOU SEE PICTURES AND YOU SEE WORDS BUT REALLY ALL THERE ARE ARE ONES AND ZEROS
BarrySchuler_2008P@302.65:311.00 THE LANGUAGE OF TECHNOLOGY IS BINARY YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD THAT AT SOME POINT IN TIME EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN DIGITAL IS
BarrySchuler_2008P@311.61:319.25 CONVERTED OR A REPRESENTATION OF A ONE AND A ZERO SO WHEN YOU'RE LISTENING TO ITUNES AND YOUR FAVORITE
BarrySchuler_2008P@347.55:354.89 A LOT OF WAYS TO DESCRIBE MECHANISMS SO LET 'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS SO IF YOU LOOK AT A HUMAN GENOME
BarrySchuler_2008P@355.36:365.57 THEY CONSIST OF THREE POINT TWO BILLION OF THESE BASE PAIRS THAT'S A LOT AND THEY MIX UP IN ALL DIFFERENT FASHIONS AND THAT MAKES YOU A HUMAN BEING
BarrySchuler_2008P@366.74:374.81 IF YOU CONVERT THAT TO BINARY JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF SIZING WE'RE ACTUALLY SMALLER THAN THE PROGRAM MICROSOFT OFFICE
BarrySchuler_2008P@376.30:382.18 IT'S NOT REALLY ALL THAT MUCH DATA I WILL ALSO TELL YOU WE'RE AT LEAST AS BUGGY
BarrySchuler_2008P@385.51:392.56 THIS HERE IS A BUG IN MY GENOME THAT I HAVE STRUGGLED WITH FOR A LONG LONG TIME
BarrySchuler_2008P@394.04:401.75 WHEN YOU GET SICK IT IS A BUG IN YOUR GENOME IN FACT MANY MANY DISEASES
BarrySchuler_2008P@401.83:409.77 WE HAVE STRUGGLED WITH FOR A LONG TIME LIKE CANCER WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CURE BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS
BarrySchuler_2008P@409.92:419.45 THE GENOMIC LEVEL WE ARE STARTING TO UNDERSTAND THAT SO UP TO THIS POINT WE TRIED TO FIX IT BY USING WHAT I CALL SHIT AGAINST THE WALL PHARMACOLOGY WHICH MEANS
BarrySchuler_2008P@419.95:429.50 WELL LET 'S JUST THROW CHEMICALS AT IT AND MAYBE IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT WORK BUT IF YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY DOES A CELL GO FROM NORMAL
BarrySchuler_2008P@430.01:440.69 CELL TO CANCER WHAT IS THE CODE WHAT ARE THE EXACT INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE MAKING IT DO THAT THEN YOU CAN GO ABOUT THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIX IT AND FIGURE IT OUT
BarrySchuler_2008P@441.11:453.85 SO FOR YOUR NEXT DINNER OVER A GREAT BOTTLE OF WINE HERE 'S A FEW FACTOIDS FOR YOU WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND GENES THAT DO THINGS WE HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND OTHERS
BarrySchuler_2008P@454.39:463.47 THAT DON'T APPEAR TO FUNCTION EVERY DAY BUT REPRESENT THIS ARCHIVAL HISTORY OF HOW WE USED TO WORK AS A SPECIES GOING BACK
BarrySchuler_2008P@463.83:474.67 TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING THAT A MOUSE HAS ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF GENES THEY RECENTLY SEQUENCED PINOT NOIR AND IT ALSO HAS ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND GENES
BarrySchuler_2008P@475.58:485.77 SO THE NUMBER OF GENES YOU HAVE MAY NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE COMPLEXITY OR THE EVOLUTIONARY ORDER OF ANY PARTICULAR SPECIES NOW LOOK AROUND
BarrySchuler_2008P@486.27:499.16 JUST LOOK NEXT TO YOUR NEIGHBOR LOOK FORWARD LOOK BACKWARD WE ALL LOOK PRETTY DIFFERENT A LOT OF VERY HANDSOME AND PRETTY PEOPLE HERE SKINNY CHUBBY DIFFERENT RACES CULTURES WE ARE ALL NINETY NINE POINT NINE
BarrySchuler_2008P@499.61:509.02 PERCENT GENETICALLY EQUAL IT IS ONE ONE HUNDREDTH OF ONE PERCENT OF GENETIC MATERIAL THAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANY ONE OF US
BarrySchuler_2008P@509.85:520.14 THAT'S A TINY AMOUNT OF MATERIAL BUT THE WAY THAT ULTIMATELY EXPRESSES ITSELF IS WHAT MAKES CHANGES IN HUMANS AND IN ALL SPECIES
BarrySchuler_2008P@547.36:554.16 ALL THE TIME THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING WITH GENE SEQUENCING NOW WE ARE ON THE CUSP OF BEING ABLE TO SEQUENCE HUMAN
BarrySchuler_2008P@555.15:567.13 FOR ABOUT DOLLAR FIVE THOUSAND IN ABOUT AN HOUR OR A HALF HOUR YOU WILL SEE THAT HAPPEN IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU ARE GOING TO WALK AROUND WITH YOUR OWN PERSONAL GENOME ON A SMART CARD
BarrySchuler_2008P@567.95:576.87 IT WILL BE HERE AND WHEN YOU BUY MEDICINE YOU WON 'T BE BUYING A DRUG THAT'S USED FOR EVERYBODY YOU WILL GIVE YOUR GENOME TO THE PHARMACIST
BarrySchuler_2008P@577.20:586.94 AND YOUR DRUG WILL BE MADE FOR YOU AND IT WILL WORK MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONES THAT WERE YOU WON 'T HAVE SIDE EFFECTS ALL THOSE SIDE EFFECTS YOU KNOW OILY RESIDUE AND YOU KNOW WHATEVER THEY
BarrySchuler_2008P@587.49:592.46 IN THOSE COMMERCIALS FORGET ABOUT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE ALL THAT STUFF GO AWAY
BarrySchuler_2008P@592.91:605.06 WHAT DOES A GENOME LOOK LIKE WELL THERE IT IS IT IS A LONG LONG SERIES OF THESE BASE PAIRS IF YOU SAW THE GENOME FOR A MOUSE OF FOR A HUMAN IT WOULD LOOK NO DIFFERENT THAN
BarrySchuler_2008P@605.55:614.97 BUT WHAT SCIENTISTS ARE DOING NOW IS THEY'RE UNDERSTANDING WHAT THESE DO AND WHAT THEY MEAN BECAUSE WHAT NATURE IS DOING IS DOUBLE CLICKING ALL THE TIME
BarrySchuler_2008P@615.35:622.60 IN OTHER WORDS THE FIRST COUPLE OF SENTENCES HERE ASSUMING THIS IS A GRAPE PLANT MAKE A ROOT
BarrySchuler_2008P@623.27:633.08 MAKE A BRANCH CREATE A BLOSSOM IN A HUMAN BEING DOWN IN HERE IT COULD BE MAKE BLOOD CELLS START CANCER
BarrySchuler_2008P@634.79:643.65 FOR ME IT MAY BE EVERY CALORIE YOU CONSUME YOU CONSERVE BECAUSE I COME FROM A VERY COLD CLIMATE FOR MY WIFE
BarrySchuler_2008P@643.90:653.34 EAT THREE TIMES AS MUCH AND YOU NEVER PUT ON ANY WEIGHT IT'S ALL HIDDEN IN THIS CODE AND IT'S STARTING TO BE UNDERSTOOD AT BREAKNECK PACE
BarrySchuler_2008P@654.13:660.98 SO WHAT CAN WE DO WITH GENOMES NOW THAT WE CAN READ THEM NOW THAT WE'RE STARTING TO HAVE THE BOOK OF LIFE WELL THERE'S MANY THINGS
BarrySchuler_2008P@661.29:669.30 SOME ARE EXCITING SOME PEOPLE WILL FIND VERY SCARY I WILL TELL YOU A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WILL PROBABLY MAKE YOU WANT TO PROJECTILE PUKE ON ME BUT THAT'S OKAY
BarrySchuler_2008P@670.90:678.36 SO YOU KNOW WE NOW CAN LEARN THE HISTORY OF ORGANISMS YOU CAN DO A VERY SIMPLE TEST SCRAPE YOUR CHEEK SEND IT OFF YOU CAN FIND OUT
BarrySchuler_2008P@708.26:714.74 HOW WE MAY BE ABLE TO FIX THEM BECAUSE WE CAN UNDERSTAND THIS WE CAN FIX THEM MAKE BETTER ORGANISMS
BarrySchuler_2008P@724.96:731.57 FAR BETTER AND SMARTER THAN US HAS GIVEN US THAT TOOLBOX AND WE NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE IT
BarrySchuler_2008P@745.66:757.88 YOU HAVE A UTI YOU'VE PROBABLY OR EVER HAD A UTI YOU'VE COME IN CONTACT WITH THIS LITTLE BUG VERY SIMPLE ONLY HAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX GENES BUT WE WERE ABLE TO
BarrySchuler_2008P@758.99:761.32 COMPLETELY SYNTHESIZE THAT GENOME
BarrySchuler_2008P@762.21:771.51 NOW YOU HAVE THE GENOME AND YOU SAY TO YOURSELF SO IF I PLUG THIS SYNTHETIC GENOME IF I PULL THE OLD ONE OUT AND PLUG IT IN DOES IT JUST BOOT UP AND LIVE
BarrySchuler_2008P@775.99:785.25 NOT ONLY DOES IT DO THAT IF YOU TOOK THE GENOME THAT SYNTHETIC GENOME AND YOU PLUGGED IT INTO A DIFFERENT CRITTER LIKE YEAST
BarrySchuler_2008P@785.82:787.93 YOU NOW TURN THAT YEAST INTO
BarrySchuler_2008P@789.65:791.72 SORT OF LIKE BOOTING UP A PC WITH
BarrySchuler_2008P@792.23:805.10 A MAC OS SOFTWARE WELL ACTUALLY YOU COULD DO IT THE OTHER WAY SO YOU KNOW BY BEING ABLE TO WRITE A GENOME AND PLUG IT INTO AN ORGANISM THE SOFTWARE IF YOU WILL
BarrySchuler_2008P@805.86:807.07 CHANGES THE HARDWARE
BarrySchuler_2008P@807.84:810.59 AND THIS IS EXTREMELY PROFOUND
BarrySchuler_2008P@811.54:822.85 LAST YEAR THE FRENCH AND ITALIANS ANNOUNCED THEY GOT TOGETHER AND THEY WENT AHEAD AND THEY SEQUENCED PINOT NOIR THE GENOMIC SEQUENCE NOW EXISTS FOR THE ENTIRE PINOT NOIR ORGANISM
BarrySchuler_2008P@823.53:833.00 THEY IDENTIFIED ONCE AGAIN ABOUT TWENTY NINE THOUSAND GENES THEY HAVE DISCOVERED PATHWAYS THAT CREATE FLAVORS ALTHOUGH IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT
BarrySchuler_2008P@833.22:847.45 THOSE COMPOUNDS THAT IT'S CRANKING OUT HAVE TO MATCH A RECEPTOR IN OUR GENOME IN OUR TONGUE FOR US TO UNDERSTAND AND INTERPRET THOSE FLAVORS THEY'VE ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THERE'S A HECK OF A LOT OF ACTIVITY GOING ON PRODUCING AROMA AS WELL
BarrySchuler_2008P@864.03:870.19 KNOWING THAT WE CAN READ IT KNOWING THAT WE CAN WRITE IT CHANGE IT MAYBE WRITE ITS GENOME FROM SCRATCH
BarrySchuler_2008P@871.96:875.62 WELL ONE THING YOU COULD DO IS WHAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT CALL FRANKEN
BarrySchuler_2008P@879.36:881.70 WE CAN BUILD A BETTER VINE
BarrySchuler_2008P@882.23:891.75 BY THE WAY JUST SO YOU KNOW YOU GET STRESSED OUT ABOUT GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE VINE IN THIS VALLEY OR ANYWHERE THAT IS NOT GENETICALLY MODIFIED
BarrySchuler_2008P@892.22:900.91 NOT GROWN FROM SEEDS THEY'RE GRAFTED INTO ROOT STOCK THEY WOULD NOT EXIST IN NATURE ON THEIR OWN SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT DON'T STRESS ABOUT THAT STUFF WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOREVER
BarrySchuler_2008P@901.27:911.11 SO WE COULD YOU KNOW FOCUS ON DISEASE RESISTANCE WE CAN GO FOR HIGHER YIELDS WITHOUT NECESSARILY HAVING DRAMATIC FARMING TECHNIQUES TO DO IT OR
BarrySchuler_2008P@911.70:918.91 WE COULD CONCEIVABLY EXPAND THE CLIMATE WINDOW WE COULD MAKE PINOT NOIR GROW MAYBE IN LONG ISLAND GOD FORBID
BarrySchuler_2008P@923.24:935.34 WE COULD PRODUCE BETTER FLAVORS AND AROMAS YOU WANT A LITTLE MORE RASPBERRY A LITTLE MORE CHOCOLATE HERE OR THERE ALL OF THESE THINGS COULD CONCEIVABLY BE DONE AND I WILL TELL YOU I 'D PRETTY MUCH BET THAT IT WILL BE DONE
BarrySchuler_2008P@935.75:943.53 BUT THERE'S AN ECOSYSTEM HERE IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE NOT SORT OF UNIQUE LITTLE ORGANISMS RUNNING AROUND WE ARE PART OF A BIG
BarrySchuler_2008P@946.11:954.22 I'M SORRY TO INFORM YOU THAT INSIDE OF YOUR DIGESTIVE TRACT IS ABOUT TEN POUNDS OF MICROBES WHICH YOU'RE CIRCULATING THROUGH YOUR BODY QUITE A BIT
BarrySchuler_2008P@955.13:965.76 OUR OCEAN 'S TEAMING WITH MICROBES IN FACT WHEN CRAIG VENTER WENT AND SEQUENCED THE MICROBES IN THE OCEAN IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS TRIPLED THE KNOWN SPECIES ON THE PLANET
BarrySchuler_2008P@966.11:979.16 BY DISCOVERING ALL NEW MICROBES IN THE FIRST TWENTY FEET OF WATER WE NOW UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE MICROBES HAVE MORE IMPACT ON OUR CLIMATE AND REGULATING CO TWO AND OXYGEN THAN PLANTS DO WHICH WE ALWAYS THOUGHT OXYGENATE THE ATMOSPHERE
BarrySchuler_2008P@979.60:987.53 WE FIND MICROBIAL LIFE IN EVERY PART OF THE PLANET IN ICE IN COAL IN ROCKS IN
BarrySchuler_2008P@1012.84:1021.10 OF THE PLANTS THEMSELVES IF YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT A ROOT SYSTEM YOU WILL FIND THERE ARE MANY MANY MANY DIVERSE MICROBIAL COLONIES
BarrySchuler_2008P@1021.30:1029.93 THIS IS NOT BIG NEWS TO VITICULTURISTS THEY HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW CONCERNED WITH WATER AND FERTILIZATION AND AGAIN THIS IS SORT OF MY
BarrySchuler_2008P@1030.74:1040.87 NOTION OF SHIT AGAINST THE WALL PHARMACOLOGY YOU KNOW CERTAIN FERTILIZERS MAKE THE PLANT MORE HEALTHY SO YOU PUT MORE IN YOU DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WITH GRANULARITY
BarrySchuler_2008P@1050.20:1062.49 WE ALL TALK ABOUT TERROIR WE WORSHIP TERROIR WE SAY WOW IS MY TERROIR GREAT IT'S SO SPECIAL I'VE GOT THIS PIECE OF LAND AND IT CREATES TERROIR LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE WELL YOU KNOW WE REALLY
BarrySchuler_2008P@1062.95:1074.66 WE ARGUE AND DEBATE ABOUT IT WE SAY IT'S CLIMATE IT'S SOIL IT'S THIS WELL GUESS WHAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HECK TERROIR IS IT'S IN THERE WAITING TO BE SEQUENCED THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF MICROBES THERE
BarrySchuler_2008P@1075.22:1083.85 EASY TO SEQUENCE UNLIKE A HUMAN THEY YOU KNOW HAVE A THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND GENES WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY ARE ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GO AROUND AND SAMPLE
BarrySchuler_2008P@1085.60:1099.49 DIG INTO THE GROUND FIND THOSE BUGS SEQUENCE THEM CORRELATE THEM TO THE KINDS OF CHARACTERISTICS WE LIKE AND DON'T LIKE THAT'S JUST A BIG DATABASE AND THEN FERTILIZE AND THEN WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS TERROIR
BarrySchuler_2008P@1099.81:1112.09 SO SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY OH MY GOD ARE WE PLAYING GOD ARE WE NOW IF WE ENGINEER ORGANISMS ARE WE PLAYING GOD AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE WOULD ALWAYS ASK JAMES WATSON HE 'S NOT ALWAYS THE MOST POLITICALLY CORRECT GUY
BarrySchuler_2008P@1113.85:1114.70 AND THEY WOULD SAY
BarrySchuler_2008P@1115.98:1121.01 ARE YOU KNOW ARE YOU PLAYING GOD AND HE HAD THE BEST ANSWER I EVER HEARD TO THIS QUESTION
BarrySchuler_2008P@1127.60:1138.91 I CONSIDER MYSELF A VERY SPIRITUAL PERSON AND WITHOUT YOU KNOW THE ORGANIZED RELIGION PART AND I WILL TELL YOU I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING UNNATURAL I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
BarrySchuler_2008P@1152.31:1162.03 BUT WE DON'T MAKE ANYTHING UNNATURAL NOW WE CAN CREATE BAD IMPACTS WE CAN POISON OURSELVES WE CAN POISON THE EARTH BUT THAT'S JUST A NATURAL OUTCOME OF A MISTAKE WE
BarrySchuler_2008P@1163.31:1170.73 SO WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY IS NATURE IS PRESENTING US WITH A TOOLBOX AND WE FIND THAT THIS TOOLBOX IS VERY EXTENSIVE
BarrySchuler_2008P@1171.19:1177.21 THERE ARE MICROBES OUT THERE THAT ACTUALLY MAKE GASOLINE BELIEVE IT OR NOT THERE ARE MICROBES YOU KNOW GO BACK TO YEAST
BarrySchuler_2008P@1177.51:1186.29 THESE ARE CHEMICAL FACTORIES THE MOST SOPHISTICATED CHEMICAL FACTORIES ARE PROVIDED BY NATURE AND WE
BarrySchuler_2008P@1187.36:1197.93 ALSO IS A SET OF RULES NATURE WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO WE COULD ENGINEER A GRAPE PLANT BUT GUESS WHAT WE CAN'T MAKE THE GRAPE PLANT PRODUCE BABIES NATURE HAS PUT A SET OF RULES OUT THERE
BarrySchuler_2008P@1198.77:1206.89 WE CAN WORK WITHIN THE RULES WE CAN'T BREAK THE RULES WE'RE JUST LEARNING WHAT THE RULES ARE I JUST ASK THE QUESTION IF YOU COULD CURE ALL DISEASE
BarrySchuler_2008P@1207.06:1219.03 IF YOU COULD MAKE DISEASE GO AWAY BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND HOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS IF WE COULD END HUNGER BY BEING ABLE TO CREATE NUTRITIOUS HEALTHY PLANTS THAT GROW IN VERY HARD TO GROW ENVIRONMENTS
BarrySchuler_2008P@1219.72:1229.29 IF WE COULD CREATE CLEAN AND PLENTIFUL ENERGY WE RIGHT IN THE LABS AT SYNTHETIC GENOMICS HAVE SINGLE CELLED ORGANISMS THAT ARE TAKING CARBON DIOXIDE
BarrySchuler_2008P@1230.20:1233.35 AND PRODUCING A MOLECULE VERY SIMILAR TO GASOLINE
BarrySchuler_2008P@1245.13:1253.38 IS HIGHLY REFINED WE COULD SOLVE OUR ENERGY PROBLEMS WE CAN REDUCE CO TWO WE COULD CLEAN UP OUR OCEANS WE COULD MAKE BETTER WINE
BarrySchuler_2008P@1253.76:1255.70 IF WE COULD WOULD WE
BarrySchuler_2008P@1256.65:1264.38 WELL YOU KNOW I THINK THE ANSWER IS VERY SIMPLE WORKING WITH NATURE WORKING WITH THIS TOOL SET THAT WE NOW UNDERSTAND
