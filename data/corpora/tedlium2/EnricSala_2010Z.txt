EnricSala_2010Z@16.47:19.33 TELL YOU TWO THINGS TODAY ONE IS WHAT WE HAVE LOST AND
EnricSala_2010Z@20.16:24.53 A WAY TO BRING IT BACK AND LET ME START WITH THIS THIS IS MY BASELINE
EnricSala_2010Z@25.36:27.80 THIS IS THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST
EnricSala_2010Z@28.35:28.88 WITH NO FISH
EnricSala_2010Z@31.93:34.13 AND LOTS OF SEA URCHINS THAT LIKE TO EAT THE ALGAE
EnricSala_2010Z@43.50:45.47 NOW IF AN ALIEN CAME TO EARTH
EnricSala_2010Z@47.63:49.64 JOE WHAT WOULD JOE SEE
EnricSala_2010Z@56.38:63.82 VERY UNLIKELY JOE WOULD JUMP ON A PRISTINE CORAL REEF A VIRGIN CORAL REEF WITH LOTS OF CORAL SHARKS CROCODILES MANATEES GROUPERS
EnricSala_2010Z@72.76:77.55 HERE WE HAVE THE EXTREME WITH DEAD CORALS MICROBIAL SOUP AND JELLYFISH
EnricSala_2010Z@78.01:88.57 AND WHERE THE DIVER IS YOU KNOW THIS IS PROBABLY WHERE MOST OF THE REEFS IN THE WORLD ARE NOW WITH VERY FEW CORALS ALGAE OVERGROWING THE CORALS LOTS OF BACTERIA AND WHERE THE LARGE ANIMALS ARE GONE
EnricSala_2010Z@95.04:100.64 BECAUSE WE STARTED MODERN SCIENCE WITH SCUBA DIVING LONG AFTER WE STARTED DEGRADING MARINE ECOSYSTEMS
EnricSala_2010Z@101.59:108.77 SO I'M GOING TO GET US ALL ON A TIME MACHINE AND WE'RE GOING TO THE LEFT WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO THE PAST TO SEE WHAT THE OCEAN WAS LIKE
EnricSala_2010Z@110.17:120.43 AND LET 'S START WITH THIS TIME MACHINE THE LINE ISLANDS WHERE WE HAVE CONDUCTED A SERIES OF NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC EXPEDITIONS THIS SEA IS A ARCHIPELAGO BELONGING TO KIRIBATI THAT SPANS ACROSS THE EQUATOR
EnricSala_2010Z@120.83:134.70 AND IT HAS SEVERAL UNINHABITED UNFISHED PRISTINE ISLANDS AND A FEW INHABITED ISLANDS SO LET 'S START WITH THE FIRST ONE CHRISTMAS ISLAND OVER FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE MOST OF THE REEFS ARE DEAD MOST OF THE CORALS ARE DEAD OVERGROWN BY ALGAE
EnricSala_2010Z@135.88:139.24 AND MOST OF THE FISH ARE SMALLER THAN THE PENCILS WE USE TO
EnricSala_2010Z@140.64:146.06 WE DID TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOURS OF DIVING HERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE WE DIDN'T SEE A SINGLE SHARK
EnricSala_2010Z@174.13:180.47 IF WE GO BACK TO A PLACE LIKE PALMYRA ATOLL WHERE I WAS WITH JEREMY JACKSON A FEW YEARS AGO
EnricSala_2010Z@181.98:188.94 THE CORALS ARE DOING BETTER AND THERE ARE SHARKS YOU CAN SEE SHARKS IN EVERY SINGLE DIVE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY UNUSUAL IN TODAY 'S CORAL REEFS
EnricSala_2010Z@194.41:203.37 THEN WE GET TO THE PLACES WHERE THE CORALS ARE ABSOLUTELY HEALTHY AND GORGEOUS FORMING SPECTACULAR STRUCTURES AND WHERE THE PREDATORS ARE THE MOST
EnricSala_2010Z@204.26:208.56 CONSPICUOUS THING WHERE YOU SEE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND FIFTY SHARKS PER
EnricSala_2010Z@210.99:216.33 WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED FROM THESE PLACES THESE ARE WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS NATURAL
EnricSala_2010Z@230.50:236.09 THEN THE PLANKTON FEEDERS THESE LITTLE DAMSELFISH THE LITTLE ANIMALS FLOATING IN THE WATER
EnricSala_2010Z@236.73:243.15 AND THEN WE HAVE A LOWER BIOMASS OF CARNIVORES AND A LOWER BIOMASS OF TOP HEAD OR THE SHARKS THE LARGE SNAPPERS THE LARGE GROUPERS
EnricSala_2010Z@243.80:249.39 BUT THIS IS A CONSEQUENCE THIS VIEW OF THE WORLD IS A CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING STUDIED DEGRADED REEFS
EnricSala_2010Z@250.16:254.35 WHEN WE WENT TO PRISTINE REEFS WE REALIZED THAT THE NATURAL WORLD WAS UPSIDE DOWN
EnricSala_2010Z@255.27:256.61 THIS PYRAMID WAS INVERTED
EnricSala_2010Z@257.64:264.48 THE TOP HEAD DOES ACCOUNT FOR MOST OF THE BIOMASS IN SOME PLACES UP TO EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT LIKE KINGMAN REEF WHICH IS NOW PROTECTED
EnricSala_2010Z@265.30:268.99 THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IN ADDITION TO HAVING MORE PREDATORS THERE'S MORE OF EVERYTHING
EnricSala_2010Z@269.55:277.42 THE SIZE OF THESE BOXES IS BIGGER WE HAVE MORE SHARKS MORE BIOMASS OF SNAPPERS MORE BIOMASS OF HERBIVORES TOO LIKE THIS PARROT FISH
EnricSala_2010Z@277.92:287.36 THAT ARE LIKE MARINE GOATS THEY CLEAN THE REEF EVERYTHING THAT GROWS ENOUGH TO BE SEEN THEY EAT AND THEY KEEP THE REEF CLEAN AND ALLOW THE CORALS TO REPLENISH
EnricSala_2010Z@287.80:299.74 NOT ONLY DO THESE PLACES THESE ANCIENT PRISTINE PLACES HAVE LOTS OF FISH BUT THEY ALSO HAVE OTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF THE ECOSYSTEM LIKE GIANT CLAMS PAVEMENTS OF GIANT CLAMS IN THE LAGOONS UP TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE PER SQUARE METER
EnricSala_2010Z@309.89:316.58 STILL NOW WE HAVE GLOBAL WARMING IF WE DON'T HAVE FISHING BECAUSE THESE REEFS ARE PROTECTED BY LAW OR THEIR REMOTENESS THIS IS GREAT BUT
EnricSala_2010Z@317.26:328.00 THE WATER GETS WARMER FOR TOO LONG AND THE CORALS DIE SO HOW ARE THESE FISH THESE PREDATORS GOING TO HELP WELL WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA
EnricSala_2010Z@328.54:333.21 DURING EL NINO YEAR NINETY SEVEN NINETY EIGHT THE WATER WAS TOO WARM FOR TOO LONG AND MANY CORALS BLEACHED
EnricSala_2010Z@336.14:341.96 IN CHRISTMAS WHERE THE FOOD WEB IS REALLY TRIMMED DOWN WHERE THE LARGE ANIMALS ARE GONE THE CORALS HAVE
EnricSala_2010Z@347.10:347.39 BUT
EnricSala_2010Z@348.84:352.10 YOU SEE HERE A BIG TABLE CORAL THAT DIED AND COLLAPSED
EnricSala_2010Z@352.67:364.77 AND THE FISH HAVE GRAZED THE ALGAE SO THE TURF OF ALGAE IS A LITTLE LOWER THEN YOU GO TO PALMYRA ATOLL THAT HAS MORE BIOMASS OF HERBIVORES AND THOSE CORALS ARE CLEAN AND
EnricSala_2010Z@365.72:369.92 THE CORALS ARE COMING BACK AND WHEN YOU GO TO THE PRISTINE SIDE DID THIS EVER BLEACH
EnricSala_2010Z@377.90:384.18 THE HIGHER THE RESILIENCE THE MORE LIKELY THAT THE SYSTEM IS GOING TO RECOVER FROM THE SHORT TERM IMPACTS OF WARMING EVENTS
EnricSala_2010Z@393.01:396.83 SO THE ECOSYSTEM CAN ADAPT TO THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING
EnricSala_2010Z@397.71:404.18 SO IF WE HAVE TO RESET THE BASELINE IF WE HAVE TO PUSH THE ECOSYSTEM BACK TO THE LEFT HOW CAN WE DO IT
EnricSala_2010Z@404.60:414.02 WELL THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS ONE VERY CLEAR WAY IS THE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS ESPECIALLY NO TAKE RESERVES THAT WE SET ASIDE TO ALLOW FOR THE RECOVERY FOR MARINE LIFE
EnricSala_2010Z@414.86:418.11 AND LET ME GO BACK TO THAT IMAGE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN
EnricSala_2010Z@419.55:422.06 THIS WAS MY BASELINE THIS IS WHAT I SAW WHEN I WAS A KID
EnricSala_2010Z@422.51:426.62 AND AT THE SAME TIME I WAS WATCHING JACQUES COUSTEAU 'S SHOWS ON TV
EnricSala_2010Z@427.04:431.33 WITH ALL THIS RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY AND I THOUGHT THAT THIS RICHNESS
EnricSala_2010Z@451.68:459.39 AND IN THE SIZE OF A LAPTOP YOU CAN FIND MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED SPECIES OF ALGAE MOSTLY MICROSCOPIC FEET HUNDREDS OF
EnricSala_2010Z@461.30:462.52 THEN FEED THE FISH
EnricSala_2010Z@463.10:472.25 SO THAT THE SYSTEM RECOVERS AND THIS PARTICULAR PLACE THE MEDES ISLANDS MARINE RESERVE IS ONLY NINETY FOUR HECTARES AND IT BRINGS SIX MILLION EUROS TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY
EnricSala_2010Z@475.49:479.09 AND IT REPRESENTS EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT OF ALL THE TOURIST REVENUE
EnricSala_2010Z@479.88:485.11 SO THESE PLACES NOT ONLY HELP THE ECOSYSTEM BUT ALSO HELP THE PEOPLE WHO CAN BENEFIT FROM THE
EnricSala_2010Z@486.85:495.58 SO LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A SUMMARY OF WHAT NO TAKE RESERVES DO THESE PLACES WHEN WE PROTECT THEM WHEN WE COMPARE THEM TO UNPROTECTED AREAS NEARBY THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
EnricSala_2010Z@506.53:508.37 SO YOUR FISH ARE NOW THIS BIG
EnricSala_2010Z@517.16:526.01 FOUR POINT FIVE TIMES GREATER BIOMASS ON AVERAGE JUST AFTER FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS SOME PLACES UP TO TEN TIMES LARGER BIOMASS INSIDE THE RESERVES
EnricSala_2010Z@527.05:528.34 SO WE HAVE ALL THESE
EnricSala_2010Z@543.19:550.90 EGG CASES LAID BY A SNAIL OFF THE COAST OF CHILE AND THIS IS HOW MANY EGGS THEY LAY ON THE BOTTOM OUTSIDE THE RESERVE
EnricSala_2010Z@551.37:552.15 YOU CANNOT EVEN
EnricSala_2010Z@553.90:558.72 ONE POINT THREE MILLION EGGS PER SQUARE METER INSIDE THE MARINE RESERVE WHERE THESE SNAILS ARE VERY
EnricSala_2010Z@574.80:576.94 THE RESERVE THE MORE FISH YOU HAVE
EnricSala_2010Z@577.65:583.25 SO THE FISHERMEN ARE CATCHING MORE YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE LIMITS OF THE RESERVE ARE BECAUSE YOU SEE THE BOATS LINED UP
EnricSala_2010Z@583.84:591.13 SO THERE IS SPILL OVER THERE ARE BENEFITS BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF THESE RESERVES THAT HELP PEOPLE AROUND THEM WHILE AT THE SAME TIME
EnricSala_2010Z@591.49:596.58 THE RESERVE IS PROTECTING THE ENTIRE HABITAT IT IS BUILDING RESILIENCE
EnricSala_2010Z@597.55:599.30 SO WHAT WE HAVE NOW
EnricSala_2010Z@599.70:605.84 OR A WORLD WITHOUT RESERVES IS LIKE A DEBIT ACCOUNT WHERE WE WITHDRAW ALL THE TIME AND WE NEVER MAKE
EnricSala_2010Z@623.22:628.38 TWO EXAMPLES AGAIN OF HOW THESE RESERVES CAN BENEFIT PEOPLE THIS IS HOW MUCH
EnricSala_2010Z@631.08:637.99 IN KENYA FISHING OVER A SERIES OF YEARS IN A PLACE WHERE THERE IS NO PROTECTION IT'S A FREE FOR ALL
EnricSala_2010Z@639.96:641.25 ONCE THE MOST
EnricSala_2010Z@642.17:656.15 DEGRADING FISHING GEAR SEINE NETS WERE REMOVED THE FISHERMEN WERE CATCHING MORE IF YOU FISH LESS YOU'RE ACTUALLY CATCHING MORE BUT IF WE ADD THE NO TAKE RESERVE ON TOP OF THAT THE FISHERMEN ARE STILL MAKING MORE MONEY BY FISHING LESS AROUND AN AREA THAT IS PROTECTED
EnricSala_2010Z@668.22:681.78 THEY USED TO AGGREGATE UP TO THE TENS OF THOUSANDS THIRTY THOUSAND GROUPERS ABOUT THIS BIG IN ONE HECTARE IN ONE AGGREGATION FISHERMEN KNEW ABOUT THESE THINGS THEY CAUGHT THEM AND THEY DEPLETED THEM WHEN I WENT THERE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWO THOUSAND
EnricSala_2010Z@682.10:683.72 THERE WERE ONLY THREE THOUSAND GROUPERS LEFT
EnricSala_2010Z@684.54:689.85 AND THE FISHERMEN WERE AUTHORIZED TO CATCH THIRTY PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE SPAWNING POPULATION EVERY YEAR
EnricSala_2010Z@690.53:704.72 SO DID A SIMPLE ANALYSIS AND IT DOESN'T TAKE ROCKET SCIENCE TO FIGURE OUT THAT IF YOU TAKE THIRTY PERCENT EVERY YEAR YOUR FISHERY IS GOING TO COLLAPSE VERY QUICKLY AND WITH THE FISHERY THE ENTIRE REPRODUCTIVE ABILITY OF THE SPECIES GOES EXTINCT IT HAPPENED IN MANY PLACES AROUND THE
EnricSala_2010Z@712.38:715.73 NOW IF YOU DO ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND PROJECT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
EnricSala_2010Z@716.55:717.90 IF THE FISH WERE NOT
EnricSala_2010Z@718.55:723.15 IF WE BROUGHT JUST TWENTY DIVERS ONE MONTH PER YEAR THE REVENUE WOULD BE
EnricSala_2010Z@723.81:725.20 MORE THAN TWENTY TIMES HIGHER
EnricSala_2010Z@729.05:735.11 SO HOW MUCH OF THIS DO WE HAVE IF THIS IS SO GOOD IF THIS IS SUCH A NO BRAINER HOW MUCH OF THIS DO WE HAVE AND YOU ALREADY HEARD THAT
EnricSala_2010Z@767.85:769.81 THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR
EnricSala_2010Z@771.63:783.49 MANY OF THESE SUBSIDIES GO TO DESTRUCTIVE FISHING PRACTICES WELL THERE ARE A COUPLE ESTIMATES OF HOW MUCH IF WOULD COST TO CREATE A NETWORK OF PROTECTED AREAS COVERING TWENTY PERCENT OF THE OCEAN THAT WOULD BE ONLY A FRACTION
EnricSala_2010Z@784.63:789.70 WE ARE NOW PAYING THE GOVERNMENT HANDS OUT TO A FISHERY THAT IS COLLAPSING
EnricSala_2010Z@790.71:793.25 PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THE FISHERIES ARE COLLAPSING
EnricSala_2010Z@805.22:810.72 SAVINGS ACCOUNTS ARE GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND FOR PEOPLE WHY DON'T WE HAVE TWENTY FIFTY PERCENT OF THE OCEAN
EnricSala_2010Z@811.80:820.58 AND HOW CAN WE REACH THAT GOAL WELL THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF GETTING THERE THE TRIVIAL SOLUTION IS TO CREATE REALLY LARGE PROTECTED AREAS LIKE
EnricSala_2010Z@822.27:830.32 THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE CAN CREATE THESE LARGE RESERVES ONLY IN PLACES WHERE THERE ARE NO PEOPLE WHERE THERE IS NO SOCIAL CONFLICT WHERE THE POLITICAL COST IS REALLY LOW
EnricSala_2010Z@844.56:853.45 WELL THERE ARE THREE MAIN REASONS WHY WE DON'T HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SMALL RESERVES THE FIRST ONE IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MARINE RESERVES DO
EnricSala_2010Z@854.28:861.06 AND FISHERMEN TEND TO BE REALLY REALLY DEFENSIVE WHEN IT COMES TO REGULATING OR CLOSING AN AREA EVEN IF IT'S SMALL
EnricSala_2010Z@870.62:880.60 IT'S A TOP DOWN HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE WHERE PEOPLE WAIT FOR GOVERNMENT AGENTS TO COME AND THIS IS NOT EFFECTIVE AND THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES SO IT TAKES US TO THE THIRD
EnricSala_2010Z@881.22:886.40 REASON WHY WE DON'T HAVE MANY MORE RESERVES IS THAT THE FUNDING MODELS HAVE BEEN WRONG
EnricSala_2010Z@889.79:894.88 SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY AND RESOURCES IN A FEW SMALL AREAS USUALLY
EnricSala_2010Z@895.63:901.51 SO MARINE CONSERVATION AND COASTAL PROTECTION HAS BECOME A SINK FOR GOVERNMENT OR PHILANTHROPIC MONEY AND THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE
EnricSala_2010Z@902.38:912.38 SO THE SOLUTIONS ARE FIXING THESE THREE ISSUES FIRST WE NEED TO DEVELOP A GLOBAL AWARENESS COMPANION TO INSPIRE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND GOVERNMENTS
EnricSala_2010Z@912.80:920.38 TO CREATE NO TAKE RESERVES THAT ARE BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW IT'S THE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS VERSUS THE DEBIT ACCOUNTS WITH NO DEPOSITS
EnricSala_2010Z@921.44:926.57 SECOND WE NEED TO REDESIGN OUR GOVERNANCE SO CONSERVATION EFFORTS CAN BE DECENTRALIZED
EnricSala_2010Z@927.03:929.71 SO CONSERVATION EFFORTS DON'T DEPEND ON
EnricSala_2010Z@930.59:942.70 WORK FROM NGOS OR FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND CAN BE CREATED BY THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES LIKE IT HAPPENS IN THE PHILIPPINES AND A FEW OTHER PLACES AND THIRD AND VERY IMPORTANT WE NEED TO DEVELOP NEW BUSINESS MODELS
EnricSala_2010Z@956.71:965.84 BECAUSE WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THESE MARINE RESERVES PROVIDE SOCIAL ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND I'D LIKE TO FINISH WITH ONE THOUGHT
EnricSala_2010Z@968.29:972.03 NO ONE ORGANIZATION ALONE IS GOING TO SAVE THE OCEAN
EnricSala_2010Z@973.12:975.06 THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF COMPETITION IN THE PAST
EnricSala_2010Z@981.72:984.53 WHERE WE ARE LOOKING FOR COMPLEMENTING NOT
EnricSala_2010Z@985.48:991.28 THE STAKES ARE JUST TOO HIGH TO CONTINUE THE WAY WE ARE GOING SO LET 'S DO THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
EnricSala_2010Z@1004.70:1013.97 THAT WAS A MASTERFUL JOB OF PULLING THINGS TOGETHER FIRST OF ALL YOUR PYRAMID YOUR INVERTED PYRAMID SHOWING EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT BIOMASS IN THE PREDATORS
EnricSala_2010Z@1014.22:1020.41 THAT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE HOW COULD EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT SURVIVE ON FIFTEEN PERCENT
EnricSala_2010Z@1020.97:1029.66 WELL IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE TWO GEARS OF A WATCH A BIG ONE AND A SMALL ONE THE BIG ONE IS MOVING VERY SLOWLY AND THE SMALL ONE IS MOVING FAST THAT'S BASICALLY
EnricSala_2010Z@1031.11:1037.32 THE LOWER PARTS OF THE FOOD CHAIN THEY REPRODUCE VERY FAST THEY GROW REALLY FAST THEY PRODUCE MILLIONS OF EGGS UP THERE YOU HAVE SHARKS
EnricSala_2010Z@1046.72:1053.42 OF THESE GUYS DOWN THERE IS ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN THIS BIOMASS THAT IS NOT MOVING THEY ARE LIKE THE CAPACITORS OF
EnricSala_2010Z@1056.80:1061.05 REALLY OUR PICTURE OF A FOOD PYRAMID IS JUST WE HAVE TO CHANGE THAT COMPLETELY
EnricSala_2010Z@1061.46:1071.01 AT LEAST IN THE SEAS WHAT WE FOUND IN CORAL REEFS IS THAT THE INVERTED PYRAMID IS THE EQUIVALENT OF THE SERENGETI WITH FIVE LIONS PER WILDEBEEST AND ON LAND THIS CANNOT WORK
EnricSala_2010Z@1082.26:1089.17 SO THE NUMBERS YOU PRESENTED REALLY ARE ASTONISHING YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE SPENDING THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS NOW ON SUBSIDIES
EnricSala_2010Z@1089.64:1098.03 IT WOULD ONLY COST SIXTEEN BILLION TO SET UP TWENTY PERCENT OF THE OCEAN AS MARINE PROTECTED AREAS THAT ACTUALLY GIVE NEW LIVING
EnricSala_2010Z@1107.75:1120.05 AND THEN WE HAVE THE UNDER PERFORMANCE OF FISHERIES THAT IS FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS SO AGAIN ONE OF THE BIG SOLUTIONS IS HAVE THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION SHIFT THE SUBSIDIES TO SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES
EnricSala_2010Z@1120.48:1126.67 OKAY SO THERE'S A LOT OF EXAMPLES THAT I'M HEARING OUT THERE ABOUT ENDING THIS SUBSIDIES MADNESS SO THANK YOU FOR THOSE NUMBERS
EnricSala_2010Z@1127.44:1135.66 A PERSONAL QUESTION A LOT OF THE EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE HERE WHO 'VE BEEN IN THE OCEANS FOR A LONG TIME HAS JUST BEEN SEEING THIS DEGRADATION THE PLACES THEY SAW THAT WERE BEAUTIFUL
EnricSala_2010Z@1147.02:1156.85 IT IS A SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE WE GO THERE TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE ECOSYSTEMS TO TRY TO MEASURE OR COUNT FISH AND SHARKS AND SEE HOW THESE PLACES ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE PLACES WE KNOW BUT
EnricSala_2010Z@1157.96:1169.90 THE BEST FEELING IS THIS BIOPHILIA THAT E O WILSON TALKS ABOUT WHERE HUMANS HAVE THIS SENSE OF AWE AND WONDER IN FRONT OF UNTAMED NATURE OF RAW NATURE AND THERE ONLY THERE YOU
