IsaacMizrahi_2008@16.63:25.36 A THING ABOUT SLEEPING I DON'T SLEEP THAT MUCH AND I'VE COME TO THIS THING ABOUT LIKE NOT SLEEPING MUCH AS BEING A GREAT VIRTUE AFTER YEARS OF KIND OF BATTLING IT AS BEING A TERRIBLE
IsaacMizrahi_2008@33.49:49.07 I THINK THAT LIKE MY CREATIVITY IS GREATLY MOTIVATED BY THIS KIND OF INSOMNIA I LIE AWAKE I THINK THOUGHTS I WALK AIMLESSLY SOMETIMES I USED TO WALK MORE AT NIGHT I WALK DURING THE DAY AND I FOLLOW PEOPLE WHO I THINK LOOK INTERESTING
IsaacMizrahi_2008@51.19:61.51 AND SOMETIMES ACTUALLY ONCE IT WAS ON PAGE SIX IN THE POST THAT I WAS CRUISING THIS GUY LIKE SORT OF WHATEVER BUT I WAS ACTUALLY JUST FOLLOWING BECAUSE HE HAD THESE REALLY GREAT SHOES ON
IsaacMizrahi_2008@69.11:82.43 I THINK A LOT OF MY DESIGN IDEAS COME FROM MISTAKES AND TRICKS OF THE EYE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY IMAGES OUT THERE SO MANY CLOTHES OUT THERE
IsaacMizrahi_2008@83.09:88.17 AND THE ONLY ONES THAT LOOK INTERESTING TO ME ARE THE ONES THAT LOOK SLIGHTLY MISTAKEN OF COURSE
IsaacMizrahi_2008@89.29:101.69 OR VERY VERY SURPRISING AND OFTEN I'M DRIVING IN A TAXI AND I SEE A HOLE IN A SHIRT OR SOMETHING THAT LOOKS VERY INTERESTING OR PRETTY OR FUNCTIONAL IN SOME WAY THAT I'D NEVER SEEN HAPPEN BEFORE
IsaacMizrahi_2008@102.02:111.10 AND SO I'D MAKE THE CAR STOP AND I'D GET OUT OF THE CAR AND WALK AND SEE THAT IN FACT THERE WASN'T A HOLE BUT IT WAS TRICK OF MY EYE IT WAS A SHADOW YOU KNOW
IsaacMizrahi_2008@111.44:123.40 OR IF THERE WAS A HOLE I'D THINK LIKE OH DAMN THERE WAS ACTUALLY SOMEONE THOUGHT OF THAT THOUGHT ALREADY SOMEONE MADE THAT MISTAKE ALREADY SO I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE I DON'T KNOW WHERE INSPIRATION COMES FROM IT DOES NOT COME
IsaacMizrahi_2008@124.43:135.05 FOR ME FROM RESEARCH I DON'T GET NECESSARILY INSPIRED BY RESEARCH AS A MATTER OF FACT ONE OF THE MOST FUN THINGS I'VE EVER EVER DONE IN MY WHOLE LIFE WAS THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON AT THE GUGGENHEIM
