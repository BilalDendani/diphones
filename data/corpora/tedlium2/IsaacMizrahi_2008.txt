IsaacMizrahi_2008 A THING ABOUT SLEEPING I DON'T SLEEP THAT MUCH AND I'VE COME TO THIS THING ABOUT LIKE NOT SLEEPING MUCH AS BEING A GREAT VIRTUE AFTER YEARS OF KIND OF BATTLING IT AS BEING A TERRIBLE
IsaacMizrahi_2008 I THINK THAT LIKE MY CREATIVITY IS GREATLY MOTIVATED BY THIS KIND OF INSOMNIA I LIE AWAKE I THINK THOUGHTS I WALK AIMLESSLY SOMETIMES I USED TO WALK MORE AT NIGHT I WALK DURING THE DAY AND I FOLLOW PEOPLE WHO I THINK LOOK INTERESTING
IsaacMizrahi_2008 AND SOMETIMES ACTUALLY ONCE IT WAS ON PAGE SIX IN THE POST THAT I WAS CRUISING THIS GUY LIKE SORT OF WHATEVER BUT I WAS ACTUALLY JUST FOLLOWING BECAUSE HE HAD THESE REALLY GREAT SHOES ON
IsaacMizrahi_2008 I THINK A LOT OF MY DESIGN IDEAS COME FROM MISTAKES AND TRICKS OF THE EYE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY IMAGES OUT THERE SO MANY CLOTHES OUT THERE
IsaacMizrahi_2008 AND THE ONLY ONES THAT LOOK INTERESTING TO ME ARE THE ONES THAT LOOK SLIGHTLY MISTAKEN OF COURSE
IsaacMizrahi_2008 OR VERY VERY SURPRISING AND OFTEN I'M DRIVING IN A TAXI AND I SEE A HOLE IN A SHIRT OR SOMETHING THAT LOOKS VERY INTERESTING OR PRETTY OR FUNCTIONAL IN SOME WAY THAT I'D NEVER SEEN HAPPEN BEFORE
IsaacMizrahi_2008 AND SO I'D MAKE THE CAR STOP AND I'D GET OUT OF THE CAR AND WALK AND SEE THAT IN FACT THERE WASN'T A HOLE BUT IT WAS TRICK OF MY EYE IT WAS A SHADOW YOU KNOW
IsaacMizrahi_2008 OR IF THERE WAS A HOLE I'D THINK LIKE OH DAMN THERE WAS ACTUALLY SOMEONE THOUGHT OF THAT THOUGHT ALREADY SOMEONE MADE THAT MISTAKE ALREADY SO I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE I DON'T KNOW WHERE INSPIRATION COMES FROM IT DOES NOT COME
IsaacMizrahi_2008 FOR ME FROM RESEARCH I DON'T GET NECESSARILY INSPIRED BY RESEARCH AS A MATTER OF FACT ONE OF THE MOST FUN THINGS I'VE EVER EVER DONE IN MY WHOLE LIFE WAS THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON AT THE GUGGENHEIM
IsaacMizrahi_2008 IN NEW YORK I READ PETER AND THE WOLF WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL BAND FROM JUILLIARD AND I DID LIKE YOU KNOW THE NARRATOR AND I READ IT
IsaacMizrahi_2008 AND I SAW THIS REALLY SMART CRITIC WHO I LOVE THIS WOMAN JOAN ACOCELLA WHO 'S A FRIEND OF MINE AND SHE CAME BACKSTAGE AND SHE SAID OH YOU KNOW ISAAC DID YOU KNOW THAT TALKING ABOUT STALINISM AND TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW LIKE THE THIRTIES IN RUSSIA
IsaacMizrahi_2008 SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT I DON'T REALLY ACTUALLY I DO MY OWN KIND OF RESEARCH YOU KNOW IF I'M COMMISSIONED TO DO THE COSTUMES FOR AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY OPERA OR SOMETHING LIKE
IsaacMizrahi_2008 I WILL DO A LOT OF RESEARCH BECAUSE IT'S INTERESTING NOT BECAUSE IT'S BECAUSE WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO I'M VERY VERY VERY INSPIRED BY MOVIES THE
IsaacMizrahi_2008 OF MOVIES AND THE WAY LIGHT MAKES THE COLORS LIGHT FROM BEHIND THE PROJECTION OR LIGHT FROM THE PROJECTION MAKES THE COLORS LOOK SO IMPOSSIBLE
IsaacMizrahi_2008 AND ANYWAY ROLL THIS LITTLE CLIP I'LL JUST SHOW YOU I SIT UP AT NIGHT AND I WATCH MOVIES AND I WATCH WOMEN IN MOVIES A LOT
IsaacMizrahi_2008 AND I THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THEIR ROLES AND ABOUT YOU HAVE TO LIKE WATCH WHAT YOUR DAUGHTERS LOOK AT
IsaacMizrahi_2008 BECAUSE I LOOK AT THE WAY WOMEN ARE PORTRAYED ALL THE TIME WHETHER THEY'RE KIND OF GLORIFIED IN THIS WAY OR WHETHER THEY'RE KIND OF YOU KNOW
IsaacMizrahi_2008 IRONICALLY GLORIFIED OR WHETHER THEY 'RE YOU KNOW SORT OF DENIGRATED OR IRONICALLY DENIGRATED
IsaacMizrahi_2008 I GO BACK TO COLOR ALL THE TIME COLOR IS SOMETHING
IsaacMizrahi_2008 MOTIVATES ME A LOT IT'S RARELY COLOR THAT I FIND IN NATURE
IsaacMizrahi_2008 ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW JUXTAPOSED NEXT TO ARTIFICIAL COLOR NATURAL COLOR IS SO BEAUTIFUL SO THAT'S WHAT I DO I STUDY COLOR A LOT BUT FOR THE MOST PART I THINK
IsaacMizrahi_2008 LIKE HOW CAN I EVER MAKE ANYTHING THAT IS AS BEAUTIFUL AS THAT IMAGE OF NATALIE WOOD HOW CAN I EVER MAKE ANYTHING AS BEAUTIFUL AS GRETA GARBO I MEAN THAT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE YOU KNOW
IsaacMizrahi_2008 AND SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME LIE AWAKE AT NIGHT I GUESS YOU KNOW I WANT TO SHOW YOU I'M ALSO LIKE A BIG I
IsaacMizrahi_2008 GO TO ASTROLOGERS AND TAROT CARD READERS OFTEN AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT MOTIVATES ME A LOT PEOPLE SAY OH DO THAT AND ASTROLOGER TELLS ME TO DO SOMETHING SO I DO
