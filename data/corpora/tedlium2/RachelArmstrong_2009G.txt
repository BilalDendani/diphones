RachelArmstrong_2009G AND THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS A ONE WAY TRANSFER OF ENERGY FROM OUR ENVIRONMENT INTO OUR HOMES AND CITIES THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE
RachelArmstrong_2009G I BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR US TO CONSTRUCT GENUINELY SUSTAINABLE HOMES AND CITIES IS BY CONNECTING THEM TO NATURE NOT INSULATING THEM FROM IT
RachelArmstrong_2009G NOW IN ORDER TO DO THIS WE NEED THE RIGHT KIND OF LANGUAGE LIVING SYSTEMS ARE IN CONSTANT CONVERSATION WITH THE NATURAL WORLD THROUGH SETS OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS CALLED METABOLISM
RachelArmstrong_2009G AND THIS IS THE CONVERSION OF ONE GROUP OF SUBSTANCES INTO ANOTHER EITHER THROUGH THE PRODUCTION OR THE ABSORPTION OF ENERGY
RachelArmstrong_2009G AND THIS IS THE WAY IN WHICH LIVING MATERIALS MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR LOCAL RESOURCES IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY
RachelArmstrong_2009G SO I'M INTERESTED IN THE USE OF METABOLIC MATERIALS FOR THE PRACTICE OF ARCHITECTURE BUT THEY DON'T EXIST SO I'M HAVING TO MAKE THEM I'M WORKING WITH ARCHITECT NEIL SPILLER AT THE BARTLETT SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE
RachelArmstrong_2009G AND WE'RE COLLABORATING WITH INTERNATIONAL SCIENTISTS IN ORDER TO GENERATE THESE NEW MATERIALS FROM A BOTTOM UP APPROACH THAT MEANS WE'RE GENERATING THEM FROM SCRATCH
RachelArmstrong_2009G ONE OF OUR COLLABORATORS IS CHEMIST MARTIN HANCZYC AND HE 'S REALLY INTERESTED IN THE TRANSITION FROM INERT TO LIVING MATTER
RachelArmstrong_2009G NOW THAT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF PROCESS THAT I'M INTERESTED IN WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS SO MARTIN HE WORKS WITH A SYSTEM CALLED THE
RachelArmstrong_2009G ALL THIS IS AND IT'S MAGIC IS A LITTLE FATTY BAG AND IT'S GOT A CHEMICAL BATTERY IN IT AND IT HAS NO DNA
RachelArmstrong_2009G THIS LITTLE BAG IS ABLE TO CONDUCT ITSELF IN A WAY THAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS LIVING IT IS ABLE TO MOVE AROUND ITS ENVIRONMENT
RachelArmstrong_2009G IT CAN FOLLOW CHEMICAL GRADIENTS IT CAN UNDERGO COMPLEX REACTIONS SOME OF WHICH ARE HAPPILY ARCHITECTURAL
RachelArmstrong_2009G SO HERE WE ARE THESE ARE PROTOCELLS PATTERNING THEIR ENVIRONMENT WE DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO THAT YET
RachelArmstrong_2009G HERE THIS IS A PROTOCELL AND IT'S VIGOROUSLY SHEDDING THIS SKIN NOW THIS LOOKS LIKE A CHEMICAL KIND OF BIRTH THIS IS A VIOLENT PROCESS
RachelArmstrong_2009G HERE WE'VE GOT A PROTOCELL TO EXTRACT CARBON DIOXIDE OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND TURN IT INTO CARBONATE AND THAT'S THE SHELL AROUND THAT GLOBULAR FAT THEY ARE QUITE BRITTLE SO YOU'VE ONLY GOT A PART OF ONE
RachelArmstrong_2009G SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH THESE TECHNOLOGIES TOWARDS CREATING BOTTOM UP CONSTRUCTION APPROACHES FOR ARCHITECTURE WHICH CONTRAST
RachelArmstrong_2009G THE CURRENT VICTORIAN TOP DOWN METHODS WHICH IMPOSE STRUCTURE UPON MATTER THAT CAN'T BE ENERGETICALLY SENSIBLE
RachelArmstrong_2009G SO BOTTOM UP MATERIALS ACTUALLY EXIST TODAY THEY'VE BEEN IN USE IN ARCHITECTURE SINCE ANCIENT TIMES
RachelArmstrong_2009G IF YOU WALK AROUND THE CITY OF OXFORD WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE BRICKWORK WHICH I'VE ENJOYED DOING IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS YOU'LL ACTUALLY SEE THAT A LOT OF IT IS MADE OF LIMESTONE AND IF YOU LOOK EVEN CLOSER
RachelArmstrong_2009G BUT IMAGINE WHAT THE PROPERTIES OF THIS LIMESTONE BLOCK MIGHT BE IF THE SURFACES WERE ACTUALLY IN CONVERSATION WITH THE ATMOSPHERE MAYBE THEY COULD EXTRACT CARBON DIOXIDE
RachelArmstrong_2009G IT GIVE THIS BLOCK OF LIMESTONE NEW PROPERTIES WELL MOST LIKELY IT WOULD IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO GROW IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO SELF REPAIR AND EVEN RESPOND TO DRAMATIC CHANGES IN THE IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT
RachelArmstrong_2009G SO ARCHITECTS ARE NEVER HAPPY WITH JUST ONE BLOCK OF AN INTERESTING MATERIAL THEY THINK BIG OKAY SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT SCALING UP METABOLIC MATERIALS
RachelArmstrong_2009G WE CAN START THINKING ABOUT ECOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS LIKE REPAIR OF ATOLLS OR RECLAMATION OF PARTS OF A CITY THAT ARE DAMAGED BY WATER
RachelArmstrong_2009G SO ONE OF THESE EXAMPLES WOULD OF COURSE BE THE HISTORIC CITY OF VENICE NOW VENICE AS YOU KNOW HAS A TEMPESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SEA
RachelArmstrong_2009G AND IS BUILT UPON WOODEN PILES SO WE'VE DEVISED A WAY BY WHICH IT MAY BE POSSIBLE FOR THE PROTOCELL TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH TO SUSTAINABLY RECLAIM VENICE
RachelArmstrong_2009G SO HERE IS THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TODAY THIS IS OUR PROTOCELL TECHNOLOGY EFFECTIVELY MAKING A SHELL LIKE ITS LIMESTONE FOREFATHERS
RachelArmstrong_2009G AND DEPOSITING IT IN A VERY COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT AGAINST NATURAL MATERIALS WE'RE LOOKING AT CRYSTAL LATTICES TO SEE THE BONDING PROCESS IN THIS
RachelArmstrong_2009G NOW THIS IS THE VERY INTERESTING PART WE DON'T JUST WANT LIMESTONE DUMPED EVERYWHERE IN ALL THE PRETTY CANALS WHAT WE NEED IT TO DO IS TO BE CREATIVELY CRAFTED AROUND THE WOODEN PILES
RachelArmstrong_2009G SO YOU CAN SEE FROM THESE DIAGRAMS THAT THE PROTOCELL IS ACTUALLY MOVING AWAY FROM THE LIGHT TOWARD THE DARK FOUNDATIONS WE'VE OBSERVED THIS IN
RachelArmstrong_2009G CAN ACTUALLY MOVE AWAY FROM THE LIGHT THEY CAN ACTUALLY ALSO MOVE TOWARDS THE LIGHT YOU HAVE TO JUST CHOOSE YOUR SPECIES SO THAT THESE DON'T JUST EXIST AS ONE ENTITY WE KIND OF CHEMICALLY ENGINEER THEM
RachelArmstrong_2009G THE PROTOCELLS ARE DEPOSITING THEIR LIMESTONE VERY SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE FOUNDATIONS OF VENICE EFFECTIVELY PETRIFYING IT
RachelArmstrong_2009G NOW THIS ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE IT'S GOING TO TAKE YEARS OF TUNING AND MONITORING THIS TECHNOLOGY
RachelArmstrong_2009G IN ORDER FOR US TO BECOME READY TO TEST IT OUT IN A CASE BY CASE BASIS ON THE MOST DAMAGED AND STRESSED BUILDINGS WITHIN THE CITY OF VENICE BUT
RachelArmstrong_2009G AS THE BUILDINGS ARE REPAIRED WE WILL SEE THE ACCRETION OF A LIMESTONE REEF BENEATH THE CITY AN ACCRETION ITSELF IS A HUGE SINK OF CARBON DIOXIDE
RachelArmstrong_2009G TO THE NATURAL WORLD IN A VERY DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE WAY BUT PERHAPS THE MOST EXCITING THING ABOUT IT IS THAT THE DRIVER OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE THIS IS
RachelArmstrong_2009G SO IN SUMMARY I'M GENERATING METABOLIC MATERIALS AS A COUNTERPOISE TO VICTORIAN TECHNOLOGIES AND BUILDING ARCHITECTURES FROM A BOTTOM UP APPROACH SECONDLY
RachelArmstrong_2009G AND FINALLY AN OBSERVER IN THE FUTURE MARVELING AT A BEAUTIFUL STRUCTURE IN THE ENVIRONMENT MAY FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL
RachelArmstrong_2009G THIS STRUCTURE HAS BEEN CREATED BY A NATURAL PROCESS OR AN ARTIFICIAL ONE THANK YOU
