JoshuaPrager_2013@23.58:25.11 BUT WHO HAD CHANGED MY LIFE
JoshuaPrager_2013@25.5:28.3 I DIDN 'T HAVE A PHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO SAY I WAS COMING
JoshuaPrager_2013@28.75:33.72 I DIDN 'T HAVE AN EXACT ADDRESS BUT I KNEW HIS NAME ABED
JoshuaPrager_2013@33.9:36.72 I KNEW THAT HE LIVED IN A TOWN OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND
JoshuaPrager_2013@43.36:49.32 HE BROKE MY NECK AND SO ON AN OVERCAST MORNING IN JANUARY I HEADED NORTH
JoshuaPrager_2013@49.77:66.85 OFF IN A SILVER CHEVY TO FIND A MAN AND SOME PEACE THE ROAD DROPPED AND I EXITED JERUSALEM I THEN ROUNDED THE VERY BEND WHERE HIS BLUE TRUCK HEAVY WITH FOUR TONS OF FLOOR TILES HAD BORNE DOWN WITH GREAT SPEED ONTO THE BACK LEFT CORNER OF THE MINIBUS WHERE I SAT
JoshuaPrager_2013@67.28:70.3 I WAS THEN NINETEEN YEARS OLD
JoshuaPrager_2013@70.66:74.1 I 'D GROWN FIVE INCHES AND DONE SOME TWENTY THOUSAND PUSHUPS
JoshuaPrager_2013@78.95:83.17 PLAYING BASKETBALL WITH FRIENDS INTO THE WEE HOURS OF A MAY MORNING
JoshuaPrager_2013@83.6:89.63 I PALMED THE BALL IN MY LARGE RIGHT HAND AND WHEN THAT HAND REACHED THE RIM I FELT INVINCIBLE
JoshuaPrager_2013@90.51:93.52 I WAS OFF IN THE BUS TO GET THE PIZZA I 'D WON ON THE COURT
JoshuaPrager_2013@94.52:96.32 I DIDN 'T SEE ABED COMING
JoshuaPrager_2013@96.75:106.99 FROM MY SEAT I WAS LOOKING UP AT A STONE TOWN ON A HILLTOP BRIGHT IN THE NOONTIME SUN WHEN FROM BEHIND THERE WAS A GREAT BANG AS LOUD AND VIOLENT AS A BOMB
JoshuaPrager_2013@107.58:112.81 MY HEAD SNAPPED BACK OVER MY RED SEAT MY EARDRUM BLEW MY SHOES FLEW OFF
JoshuaPrager_2013@113.32:125.59 I FLEW TOO MY HEAD BOBBING ON BROKEN BONES AND WHEN I LANDED I WAS A QUADRIPLEGIC OVER THE COMING MONTHS I LEARNED TO BREATHE ON MY OWN THEN TO SIT AND TO STAND AND TO WALK
JoshuaPrager_2013@125.95:128.37 BUT MY BODY WAS NOW DIVIDED VERTICALLY
JoshuaPrager_2013@128.53:134.66 I WAS A HEMIPLEGIC AND BACK HOME IN NEW YORK I USED A WHEELCHAIR FOR FOUR YEARS
JoshuaPrager_2013@140.14:144.97 THERE I ROSE FROM MY CHAIR FOR GOOD I LEANED ON MY CANE AND I LOOKED
JoshuaPrager_2013@151.49:154.18 AND WHEN I SAW THIS PHOTOGRAPH
JoshuaPrager_2013@156.51:159.14 I DIDN 'T SEE A BLOODY AND UNMOVING BODY
JoshuaPrager_2013@159.59:163.16 I SAW THE HEALTHY BULK OF A LEFT DELTOID
JoshuaPrager_2013@163.3:165.43 AND I MOURNED THAT IT WAS LOST
JoshuaPrager_2013@168.29:170.22 BUT WAS NOW IMPOSSIBLE
JoshuaPrager_2013@175.66:179.79 IT WAS THEN I READ THE TESTIMONY THAT ABED GAVE THE MORNING AFTER THE CRASH
JoshuaPrager_2013@184.09:186.97 READING HIS WORDS I WELLED WITH ANGER
JoshuaPrager_2013@187.27:193.11 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I 'D FELT ANGER TOWARD THIS MAN AND IT CAME FROM MAGICAL THINKING
JoshuaPrager_2013@193.38:195.6 ON THIS XEROXED PIECE OF PAPER
JoshuaPrager_2013@199.2:204.65 ABED COULD STILL TURN HIS WHEEL LEFT SO THAT I WOULD SEE HIM WHOOSH BY OUT MY WINDOW
JoshuaPrager_2013@204.69:206.51 AND I WOULD REMAIN WHOLE
JoshuaPrager_2013@206.99:210.51 BE CAREFUL ABED LOOK OUT SLOW DOWN
JoshuaPrager_2013@211.29:213.04 BUT ABED DID NOT SLOW
JoshuaPrager_2013@213.74:216.92 AND ON THAT XEROXED PIECE OF PAPER MY NECK AGAIN BROKE
JoshuaPrager_2013@216.97:219.59 AND AGAIN I WAS LEFT WITHOUT ANGER
JoshuaPrager_2013@221.37:223.4 I DECIDED TO FIND ABED
JoshuaPrager_2013@247.18:250.71 THE QUADRIPLEGIA AND THE CATHETERS THE INSECURITY AND THE LOSS
JoshuaPrager_2013@251.17:253.9 AND WHEN ABED WENT ON ABOUT HOW HURT HE WAS IN THE CRASH
JoshuaPrager_2013@254.35:258.6 I DIDN 'T SAY THAT I KNEW FROM THE POLICE REPORT THAT HE 'D ESCAPED SERIOUS INJURY
JoshuaPrager_2013@259.17:261.98 I SAID I WANTED TO MEET
JoshuaPrager_2013@262.67:265.18 ABED SAID THAT I SHOULD CALL BACK IN A FEW WEEKS
JoshuaPrager_2013@265.86:270.04 AND WHEN I DID AND A RECORDING TOLD ME THAT HIS NUMBER WAS DISCONNECTED
JoshuaPrager_2013@277.76:279.62 I WALKED WITH MY CANE
JoshuaPrager_2013@284.33:286.36 I PITCHED OVERHAND
JoshuaPrager_2013@286.62:296.29 IN A WEEKLY SOFTBALL GAME THAT I STARTED IN CENTRAL PARK AND HOME IN NEW YORK I BECAME A JOURNALIST AND AN AUTHOR TYPING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WORDS WITH ONE FINGER
JoshuaPrager_2013@297.15:304.72 A FRIEND POINTED OUT TO ME THAT ALL OF MY BIG STORIES MIRRORED MY OWN EACH CENTERING ON A LIFE THAT HAD CHANGED IN AN INSTANT
JoshuaPrager_2013@314.44:316.87 I 'D BEEN WORKING THROUGH MY LOT AFTER ALL
JoshuaPrager_2013@317.74:323.82 STILL ABED WAS FAR FROM MY MIND WHEN LAST YEAR I RETURNED TO ISRAEL TO WRITE OF THE CRASH
JoshuaPrager_2013@324.34:327.16 AND THE BOOK I THEN WROTE HALF LIFE
JoshuaPrager_2013@332.47:334.85 AND FINALLY I UNDERSTOOD WHY
JoshuaPrager_2013@335.19:338.03 TO HEAR THIS MAN SAY TWO WORDS
JoshuaPrager_2013@343.6:348.02 AND SO I GOT A COP TO CONFIRM THAT ABED STILL LIVED SOMEWHERE IN HIS SAME TOWN
JoshuaPrager_2013@348.36:355.02 AND I WAS NOW DRIVING TO IT WITH A POTTED YELLOW ROSE IN THE BACK SEAT WHEN SUDDENLY FLOWERS SEEMED A RIDICULOUS OFFERING
JoshuaPrager_2013@355.75:358.58 BUT WHAT TO GET THE MAN WHO BROKE YOUR FUCKING NECK
JoshuaPrager_2013@375.28:376.82 ABED WOULD HUG ME
JoshuaPrager_2013@377.16:378.88 ABED WOULD SPIT AT ME
JoshuaPrager_2013@379.6:382.05 ABED WOULD SAY I 'M SORRY
JoshuaPrager_2013@383.34:392.21 I THEN BEGAN TO WONDER AS I HAD MANY TIMES BEFORE HOW MY LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT HAD THIS MAN NOT INJURED ME HAD MY GENES BEEN FED A DIFFERENT HELPING OF EXPERIENCE
JoshuaPrager_2013@392.91:394.5 WHO WAS I
JoshuaPrager_2013@395.33:397.55 WAS I WHO I HAD BEEN BEFORE THE CRASH
JoshuaPrager_2013@397.73:401.32 BEFORE THIS ROAD DIVIDED MY LIFE LIKE THE SPINE OF AN OPEN BOOK
JoshuaPrager_2013@402.01:403.89 WAS I WHAT HAD BEEN DONE TO ME
JoshuaPrager_2013@404.09:406.69 WERE ALL OF US THE RESULTS OF THINGS DONE TO US
JoshuaPrager_2013@417.26:423.16 IT SEEMED THAT WE COULD BE NOTHING MORE THAN GENES AND EXPERIENCE BUT HOW TO TEASE OUT THE ONE FROM THE OTHER
JoshuaPrager_2013@424.05:433.92 AS YEATS PUT THAT SAME UNIVERSAL QUESTION O BODY SWAYED TO MUSIC O BRIGHTENING GLANCE HOW CAN WE KNOW THE DANCER FROM THE DANCE
JoshuaPrager_2013@436.24:438.33 I 'D BEEN DRIVING FOR AN HOUR
JoshuaPrager_2013@438.57:441.9 WHEN I LOOKED IN MY REARVIEW MIRROR AND SAW MY OWN BRIGHTENING GLANCE
JoshuaPrager_2013@442.26:456.51 THE LIGHT MY EYES HAD CARRIED FOR AS LONG AS THEY HAD BEEN BLUE THE PREDISPOSITIONS AND IMPULSES THAT HAD PROPELLED ME AS A TODDLER TO TRY AND SLIP OVER A BOAT INTO A CHICAGO LAKE THAT HAD PROPELLED ME AS A TEEN TO JUMP INTO WILD CAPE COD BAY AFTER A HURRICANE
JoshuaPrager_2013@457.97:464.69 BUT I ALSO SAW IN MY REFLECTION THAT HAD ABED NOT INJURED ME I WOULD NOW IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BE A DOCTOR
JoshuaPrager_2013@476.32:483.55 THE FREQUENT FURL OF FIVE FINGERS THE CHIPS IN MY TEETH COME FROM BITING AT ALL THE MANY THINGS A SOLITARY HAND CANNOT OPEN
JoshuaPrager_2013@484.3:487.95 THE DANCER AND THE DANCE WERE HOPELESSLY ENTWINED
JoshuaPrager_2013@489.69:496.06 IT WAS APPROACHING ELEVEN WHEN I EXITED RIGHT TOWARD AFULA AND PASSED A LARGE QUARRY AND WAS SOON IN KFAR KARA
JoshuaPrager_2013@496.45:498.23 I FELT A PANG OF NERVES
JoshuaPrager_2013@498.87:500.94 BUT CHOPIN WAS ON THE RADIO
JoshuaPrager_2013@500.95:507.15 SEVEN BEAUTIFUL MAZURKAS AND I PULLED INTO A LOT BY A GAS STATION TO LISTEN AND TO CALM
JoshuaPrager_2013@508.61:514.14 I 'D BEEN TOLD THAT IN AN ARAB TOWN ONE NEED ONLY MENTION THE NAME OF A LOCAL AND IT WILL BE RECOGNIZED
JoshuaPrager_2013@514.85:520.77 AND I WAS MENTIONING ABED AND MYSELF NOTING DELIBERATELY THAT I WAS HERE IN PEACE TO THE PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN
JoshuaPrager_2013@521.34:524.5 WHEN I MET MOHAMED OUTSIDE A POST OFFICE AT NOON
JoshuaPrager_2013@524.98:526.5 HE LISTENED TO ME
JoshuaPrager_2013@527.23:533.17 YOU KNOW IT WAS MOST OFTEN WHEN SPEAKING TO PEOPLE THAT I WONDERED WHERE I ENDED AND MY DISABILITY BEGAN
JoshuaPrager_2013@534.07:536.58 FOR MANY PEOPLE TOLD ME WHAT THEY TOLD NO ONE ELSE
JoshuaPrager_2013@543.63:548.71 SHE TOLD ME THAT BEST SHE COULD TELL HER TEARS HAD HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH MY BEING HAPPY AND STRONG
JoshuaPrager_2013@556.01:560.98 BUT I WAS NOW ME DESPITE A LIMP AND THAT I SUPPOSE WAS WHAT NOW MADE ME ME
JoshuaPrager_2013@562.77:566.8 ANYWAY MOHAMED TOLD ME WHAT PERHAPS HE WOULD NOT HAVE TOLD ANOTHER STRANGER
JoshuaPrager_2013@567.05:570.38 HE LED ME TO A HOUSE OF CREAM STUCCO THEN DROVE OFF
JoshuaPrager_2013@571.09:573.76 AND AS I SAT CONTEMPLATING WHAT TO SAY
JoshuaPrager_2013@574.08:577.23 A WOMAN APPROACHED IN A BLACK SHAWL AND BLACK ROBE
JoshuaPrager_2013@577.7:581.35 I STEPPED FROM MY CAR AND SAID SHALOM AND IDENTIFIED MYSELF
JoshuaPrager_2013@581.59:585.26 AND SHE TOLD ME THAT HER HUSBAND ABED WOULD BE HOME FROM WORK IN FOUR HOURS
JoshuaPrager_2013@585.91:592.11 HER HEBREW WAS NOT GOOD AND SHE LATER CONFESSED THAT SHE THOUGHT THAT I HAD COME TO INSTALL THE INTERNET
JoshuaPrager_2013@595.72:601.86 I DROVE OFF AND RETURNED AT FOUR THIRTY THANKFUL TO THE MINARET UP THE ROAD THAT HELPED ME FIND MY WAY BACK
JoshuaPrager_2013@609.56:611.98 AN AVERAGE LOOKING MAN OF AVERAGE SIZE
JoshuaPrager_2013@629.63:633.8 AND HE TOLD ME I WAS A GUEST IN HIS HOME AND WE SAT BESIDE ONE ANOTHER ON A FABRIC COUCH
JoshuaPrager_2013@634.59:641.21 IT WAS THEN THAT ABED RESUMED AT ONCE THE TALE OF WOE HE HAD BEGUN OVER THE PHONE SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE
JoshuaPrager_2013@642.63:645.23 HE 'D JUST HAD SURGERY ON HIS EYES HE SAID
JoshuaPrager_2013@645.45:649.88 HE HAD PROBLEMS WITH HIS SIDE AND HIS LEGS TOO AND OH HE 'D LOST HIS TEETH IN THE CRASH
JoshuaPrager_2013@653.28:658.22 ABED THEN ROSE AND TURNED ON THE TV SO THAT I WOULDN 'T BE ALONE WHEN HE LEFT THE ROOM
JoshuaPrager_2013@658.51:660.71 AND RETURNED WITH POLAROIDS OF THE CRASH
JoshuaPrager_2013@660.82:662.46 AND HIS OLD DRIVER 'S LICENSE
JoshuaPrager_2013@663.97:665.92 I WAS HANDSOME HE SAID
JoshuaPrager_2013@667.13:672.05 WE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS LAMINATED MUG ABED HAD BEEN LESS HANDSOME THAN SUBSTANTIAL
JoshuaPrager_2013@672.29:683.8 WITH THICK BLACK HAIR AND A FULL FACE AND A WIDE NECK IT WAS THIS YOUTH WHO ON MAY SIXTEEN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY HAD BROKEN TWO NECKS INCLUDING MINE AND BRUISED ONE BRAIN AND TAKEN ONE LIFE
JoshuaPrager_2013@685.13:697.57 TWENTY ONE YEARS LATER HE WAS NOW THINNER THAN HIS WIFE HIS SKIN SLACK ON HIS FACE AND LOOKING AT ABED LOOKING AT HIS YOUNG SELF I REMEMBERED LOOKING AT THAT PHOTOGRAPH OF MY YOUNG SELF AFTER THE CRASH AND RECOGNIZED HIS LONGING
JoshuaPrager_2013@698.81:701.68 THE CRASH CHANGED BOTH OF OUR LIVES I SAID
JoshuaPrager_2013@705.8:710.37 AND SAID THAT THE CRASH WAS THE FAULT OF A BUS DRIVER IN THE LEFT LANE WHO DID NOT LET HIM PASS
JoshuaPrager_2013@711.31:719.59 I DID NOT WANT TO RECAP THE CRASH WITH ABED I 'D HOPED FOR SOMETHING SIMPLER TO EXCHANGE A TURKISH DESSERT FOR TWO WORDS AND BE ON MY WAY
JoshuaPrager_2013@720.58:724.99 AND SO I DIDN 'T POINT OUT THAT IN HIS OWN TESTIMONY THE MORNING AFTER THE CRASH
JoshuaPrager_2013@733.95:737.76 AND SO I NOW WENT LOOKING FOR REMORSE AND THREW TRUTH UNDER THE BUS
JoshuaPrager_2013@738.6:744.98 I UNDERSTAND I SAID THAT THE CRASH WAS NOT YOUR FAULT BUT DOES IT MAKE YOU SAD THAT OTHERS SUFFERED
JoshuaPrager_2013@746.45:749.05 ABED SPOKE THREE QUICK WORDS YES
JoshuaPrager_2013@757.19:760.29 BEFORE THE CRASH AND SO GOD HAD ORDAINED THE CRASH
JoshuaPrager_2013@760.53:763.71 BUT NOW HE SAID HE WAS RELIGIOUS AND GOD WAS PLEASED
JoshuaPrager_2013@767.49:772.84 NEWS ON THE TV OF A CAR WRECK THAT HOURS BEFORE HAD KILLED THREE PEOPLE UP NORTH
JoshuaPrager_2013@773.44:775.06 WE LOOKED UP AT THE WRECKAGE
JoshuaPrager_2013@775.81:777.73 STRANGE I SAID
JoshuaPrager_2013@778.39:780.51 STRANGE HE AGREED
JoshuaPrager_2013@781.63:784.32 I HAD THE THOUGHT THAT THERE ON ROUTE EIGHT HUNDRED AND FOUR
JoshuaPrager_2013@784.51:792.38 THERE WERE PERPETRATORS AND VICTIMS DYADS BOUND BY A CRASH SOME AS HAD ABED WOULD FORGET THE DATE SOME AS HAD I WOULD REMEMBER
JoshuaPrager_2013@796.91:802.14 IT IS A PITY HE SAID THAT THE POLICE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE NOT TOUGH ENOUGH ON BAD DRIVERS
JoshuaPrager_2013@804.09:805.7 I WAS BAFFLED
JoshuaPrager_2013@807.07:809.23 ABED HAD SAID SOMETHING REMARKABLE
JoshuaPrager_2013@813.49:817.11 WAS IT EVIDENCE OF GUILT AN ASSERTION THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT AWAY LONGER
JoshuaPrager_2013@819.48:821.39 LOST HIS TRUCK LICENSE FOR A DECADE
JoshuaPrager_2013@826.9:829.79 I THOUGHT YOU HAD A FEW DRIVING ISSUES BEFORE THE CRASH
JoshuaPrager_2013@830.6:833.92 WELL HE SAID I ONCE WENT SIXTY IN A FORTY
JoshuaPrager_2013@834.69:838.17 AND SO TWENTY SEVEN VIOLATIONS
JoshuaPrager_2013@838.4:846.71 DRIVING THROUGH A RED LIGHT DRIVING AT EXCESSIVE SPEED DRIVING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF A BARRIER AND FINALLY RIDING HIS BRAKES DOWN THAT HILL REDUCED TO ONE
JoshuaPrager_2013@847.36:853.91 AND IT WAS THEN I UNDERSTOOD THAT NO MATTER HOW STARK THE REALITY THE HUMAN BEING FITS IT INTO A NARRATIVE THAT IS PALATABLE
JoshuaPrager_2013@854.3:857.76 THE GOAT BECOMES THE HERO THE PERPETRATOR BECOMES THE VICTIM
JoshuaPrager_2013@857.94:862.26 IT WAS THEN I UNDERSTOOD THAT ABED WOULD NEVER APOLOGIZE
JoshuaPrager_2013@865.02:867.22 ABED AND I SAT WITH OUR COFFEE
JoshuaPrager_2013@868.4:870.51 WE 'D SPENT NINETY MINUTES TOGETHER
JoshuaPrager_2013@870.63:872.2 AND HE WAS NOW KNOWN TO ME
JoshuaPrager_2013@873.16:877.14 HE WAS NOT A PARTICULARLY BAD MAN OR A PARTICULARLY GOOD MAN
JoshuaPrager_2013@877.93:879.65 HE WAS A LIMITED MAN
JoshuaPrager_2013@882.93:887.66 WITH A NOD TO JEWISH CUSTOM HE TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD LIVE TO BE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS OLD
JoshuaPrager_2013@888.22:896.3 BUT IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO RELATE TO ONE WHO HAD SO COMPLETELY WASHED HIS HANDS OF HIS OWN CALAMITOUS DOING TO ONE WHOSE LIFE WAS SO UNEXAMINED
JoshuaPrager_2013@897.42:901.48 THAT HE SAID HE THOUGHT TWO PEOPLE HAD DIED IN THE CRASH
JoshuaPrager_2013@908.59:912.12 I WISHED TO TELL HIM THAT WERE HE TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY DISABILITY
JoshuaPrager_2013@919.64:922.99 PEOPLE DON 'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE LIVED THROUGH WORSE
JoshuaPrager_2013@932.26:937.67 I WISHED TO TELL HIM THAT WHAT MAKES MOST OF US WHO WE ARE MOST OF ALL
JoshuaPrager_2013@954.44:962.68 I WISHED TO TELL HIM THAT NOT ONLY PARALYZERS AND PARALYZEES MUST EVOLVE RECONCILE TO REALITY BUT WE ALL MUST
JoshuaPrager_2013@962.99:966.55 THE AGING AND THE ANXIOUS AND THE DIVORCED
JoshuaPrager_2013@966.56:969.36 AND THE BALDING AND THE BANKRUPT
JoshuaPrager_2013@983.83:987.02 BUT THAT THIS NATURAL WORLD STILL HAS MANY GLORIES
JoshuaPrager_2013@988.23:990.22 I WISHED TO TELL HIM THAT IN THE END
JoshuaPrager_2013@990.81:992.64 OUR MANDATE IS CLEAR
JoshuaPrager_2013@993.31:995.82 WE HAVE TO RISE ABOVE BAD FORTUNE
JoshuaPrager_2013@996.09:998.95 WE HAVE TO BE IN THE GOOD AND ENJOY THE GOOD
JoshuaPrager_2013@999.1:1002.51 STUDY AND WORK AND ADVENTURE
JoshuaPrager_2013@1005.15:1006.69 AND COMMUNITY
JoshuaPrager_2013@1014.16:1016.78 THAT TRULY TO ENJOY BODILY WARMTH
JoshuaPrager_2013@1016.9:1019.68 SOME SMALL PART OF YOU MUST BE COLD
JoshuaPrager_2013@1020.44:1023.16 FOR THERE IS NO QUALITY IN THIS WORLD THAT IS NOT
JoshuaPrager_2013@1023.16:1024.91 WHAT IT IS MERELY BY CONTRAST
JoshuaPrager_2013@1033.93:1037.94 AND IF THE GODS ARE KIND YOU MAY TRULY ENJOY WHAT YOU HAVE
JoshuaPrager_2013@1037.94:1042.56 THAT IS THE ONE SINGULAR GIFT YOU MAY RECEIVE IF YOU SUFFER IN ANY EXISTENTIAL WAY
JoshuaPrager_2013@1042.72:1046.88 YOU KNOW DEATH AND SO MAY WAKE EACH MORNING PULSING WITH READY LIFE
JoshuaPrager_2013@1047.13:1052.1 SOME PART OF YOU IS COLD AND SO ANOTHER PART MAY TRULY ENJOY WHAT IT IS TO BE WARM
JoshuaPrager_2013@1052.59:1054.49 OR EVEN TO BE COLD
JoshuaPrager_2013@1055.2:1063.19 WHEN ONE MORNING YEARS AFTER THE CRASH I STEPPED ONTO STONE AND THE UNDERSIDE OF MY LEFT FOOT FELT THE FLASH OF COLD NERVES AT LAST AWAKE
JoshuaPrager_2013@1063.76:1065.59 IT WAS EXHILARATING
JoshuaPrager_2013@1065.97:1067.68 A GUST OF SNOW
JoshuaPrager_2013@1068.94:1071.15 BUT I DIDN 'T SAY THESE THINGS TO ABED
JoshuaPrager_2013@1071.91:1076.05 I TOLD HIM ONLY THAT HE HAD KILLED ONE MAN NOT TWO
JoshuaPrager_2013@1076.75:1080.26 I TOLD HIM THE NAME OF THAT MAN
JoshuaPrager_2013@1081.57:1083.99 AND THEN I SAID GOODBYE
