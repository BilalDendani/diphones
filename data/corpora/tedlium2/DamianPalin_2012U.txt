DamianPalin_2012U@23.17:39.39 SO WHAT YOU 'RE SEEING HERE IS THE BACTERIA METABOLIZING AND AS THEY DO SO THEY CREATE AN ELECTRICAL CHARGE AND THIS ATTRACTS METALS FROM THEIR LOCAL ENVIRONMENT AND THESE METALS ACCUMULATE AS MINERALS ON THE SURFACE OF THE BACTERIA
DamianPalin_2012U@39.39:45.73 ONE OF THE MOST PERVASIVE PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD TODAY FOR PEOPLE IS INADEQUATE ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER
DamianPalin_2012U@45.93:62.35 AND THE DESALINATION PROCESS IS ONE WHERE WE TAKE OUT SALTS WE CAN USE IT FOR DRINKING AND AGRICULTURE REMOVING THE SALTS FROM WATER PARTICULARLY SEAWATER THROUGH REVERSE OSMOSIS IS A CRITICAL TECHNIQUE FOR COUNTRIES WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER AROUND THE GLOBE
DamianPalin_2012U@62.66:76.22 SO SEAWATER REVERSE OSMOSIS IS A MEMBRANE FILTRATION TECHNOLOGY WE TAKE THE WATER FROM THE SEA AND WE APPLY PRESSURE AND THIS PRESSURE FORCES THE SEAWATER THROUGH A MEMBRANE THIS TAKES ENERGY
DamianPalin_2012U@76.22:88.53 PRODUCING CLEAN WATER BUT WE 'RE ALSO LEFT WITH A CONCENTRATED SALT SOLUTION OR BRINE BUT THE PROCESS IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND IT 'S COST PROHIBITIVE FOR MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE GLOBE AND ALSO THE BRINE THAT 'S PRODUCED
DamianPalin_2012U@110.16:120.62 BUT THIS WILL PRODUCE AN EQUALLY MASSIVE AMOUNT OF DESALINATION BRINE AND THIS IS WHERE MY COLLABORATION WITH BACTERIA COMES INTO PLAY SO WHAT WE 'RE DOING AT THE MOMENT
DamianPalin_2012U@127.72:144.89 AND THIS IN TERMS OF MAGNESIUM AND THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT I JUST MENTIONED EQUATES TO A DOLLAR FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION MINING INDUSTRY FOR SINGAPORE A PLACE THAT DOESN 'T HAVE ANY NATURAL RESOURCES SO I 'D LIKE YOU TO IMAGE A MINING INDUSTRY IN A WAY THAT ONE HASN 'T EXISTED BEFORE
DamianPalin_2012U@144.89:149.2 IMAGINE A MINING INDUSTRY THAT DOESN 'T MEAN DEFILING THE EARTH
DamianPalin_2012U@159.05:167.56 AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THE BEGINNING OF AN INDUSTRY IN A TEST TUBE A MINING INDUSTRY THAT IS IN HARMONY WITH NATURE THANK YOU
