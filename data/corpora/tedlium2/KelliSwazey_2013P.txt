KelliSwazey_2013P IN MY HUSBAND 'S HOMELAND IN THE HIGHLANDS OF SULAWESI ISLAND IN EASTERN INDONESIA THERE IS A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE THAT EXPERIENCE DEATH NOT AS A SINGULAR EVENT BUT AS A GRADUAL SOCIAL PROCESS
KelliSwazey_2013P POINTS OF SOCIAL AND CULTURAL INTERACTION ARE NOT WEDDINGS OR BIRTHS OR EVEN FAMILY DINNERS
KelliSwazey_2013P THAT ARE SACRIFICED AND DISTRIBUTED IN THE NAME OF THE DECEASED
KelliSwazey_2013P AND IT 'S A TRANSITION THAT 'S JUST AS MUCH ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF THE LIVING AS IT IS ABOUT REMEMBRANCE OF THE DEAD SO EVERY YEAR
KelliSwazey_2013P AND FOR MANY PEOPLE THESE GRANDIOSE CEREMONIES AND THE LENGTH OF THE CEREMONIES
KelliSwazey_2013P ARE SOMEHOW INCOMMENSURABLE WITH THE WAY THAT WE FACE OUR OWN MORTALITY IN THE WEST SO EVEN AS WE SHARE DEATH AS A UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE
KelliSwazey_2013P IT 'S NOT EXPERIENCED THE SAME WAY THE WORLD OVER
KelliSwazey_2013P AND AS AN ANTHROPOLOGIST I SEE THESE DIFFERENCES IN EXPERIENCE BEING ROOTED IN THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL WORLD THROUGH WHICH WE DEFINE THE PHENOMENA AROUND US SO WHERE WE SEE AN UNQUESTIONABLE REALITY
KelliSwazey_2013P DEATH AS AN IRREFUTABLE BIOLOGICAL CONDITION
KelliSwazey_2013P IN FACT A MEMBER OF SOCIETY IS ONLY TRULY DEAD WHEN THE EXTENDED FAMILY CAN AGREE UPON AND MARSHAL THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO HOLD A FUNERAL CEREMONY THAT IS CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE IN TERMS OF RESOURCES FOR THE STATUS OF THE DECEASED
KelliSwazey_2013P AND THIS CEREMONY HAS TO TAKE PLACE IN FRONT OF THE EYES OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY WITH EVERYONE 'S PARTICIPATION
KelliSwazey_2013P SO AFTER A PERSON 'S PHYSICAL DEATH
KelliSwazey_2013P THEIR BODY IS PLACED IN A SPECIAL ROOM IN THE TRADITIONAL RESIDENCE WHICH IS CALLED THE TONGKONAN AND THE TONGKONAN IS SYMBOLIC NOT ONLY OF THE FAMILY 'S IDENTITY
KelliSwazey_2013P FROM BIRTH TO DEATH SO ESSENTIALLY THE SHAPE OF THE BUILDING THAT YOU 'RE BORN INTO IS THE SHAPE OF THE STRUCTURE WHICH CARRIES YOU TO YOUR ANCESTRAL RESTING PLACE
KelliSwazey_2013P UNTIL THE FUNERAL CEREMONY
KelliSwazey_2013P WHICH CAN BE HELD YEARS AFTER A PERSON 'S PHYSICAL DEATH THE DECEASED IS REFERRED TO AS TO MAKALA A SICK PERSON OR TO MAMA A PERSON WHO IS ASLEEP
KelliSwazey_2013P AND THEY CONTINUE TO BE A MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD THEY ARE SYMBOLICALLY FED AND CARED FOR AND THE FAMILY AT THIS TIME WILL BEGIN A NUMBER OF RITUAL INJUNCTIONS WHICH COMMUNICATES TO THE WIDER COMMUNITY AROUND THEM THAT ONE OF THEIR MEMBERS IS UNDERGOING THE TRANSITION FROM THIS LIFE
KelliSwazey_2013P SO I KNOW WHAT SOME OF YOU MUST BE THINKING RIGHT NOW IS SHE REALLY SAYING THAT THESE PEOPLE LIVE WITH THE BODIES OF THEIR DEAD RELATIVES AND THAT 'S EXACTLY WHAT I 'M SAYING
KelliSwazey_2013P I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE TORAJAN WAY OF VIEWING DEATH ENCOMPASSES OF THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE
KelliSwazey_2013P I THINK THAT TORAJANS SOCIALLY RECOGNIZE
KelliSwazey_2013P AND THAT IS THAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER HUMANS THEIR IMPACT ON OUR SOCIAL REALITY
KelliSwazey_2013P SO MY HUSBAND HAS FOND MEMORIES OF TALKING TO AND PLAYING WITH AND GENERALLY BEING AROUND HIS DECEASED GRANDFATHER AND FOR HIM THERE IS NOTHING UNNATURAL ABOUT THIS THIS IS A NATURAL PART OF THE PROCESS AS THE FAMILY COMES TO TERMS WITH THE TRANSITION
KelliSwazey_2013P IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE DECEASED AND THIS IS THE TRANSITION FROM RELATING TO THE DECEASED AS A PERSON WHO 'S LIVING TO RELATING TO THE DECEASED AS A PERSON WHO 'S AN ANCESTOR AND HERE YOU CAN SEE THESE WOODEN EFFIGIES OF THE ANCESTORS SO THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN BURIED ALREADY HAD A FUNERAL CEREMONY
KelliSwazey_2013P SO THE FUNERAL CEREMONY ITSELF EMBODIES THIS RELATIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON DEATH IT RITUALIZES THE IMPACT OF DEATH ON FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES
KelliSwazey_2013P AND IT 'S ALSO A MOMENT OF SELF AWARENESS IT 'S A MOMENT WHEN PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WHO THEY ARE
KelliSwazey_2013P AND WILL DEFINE WHO OUR LOVED ONES ARE INTO THE FUTURE SO ESSENTIALLY WE ALL BECOME GRANDPARENTS TO THE GENERATIONS OF HUMAN CHILDREN THAT COME AFTER US
KelliSwazey_2013P AND THIS METAPHOR OF MEMBERSHIP IN THE GREATER HUMAN FAMILY IS THE WAY THAT CHILDREN ALSO DESCRIBE THE MONEY THAT THEY INVEST IN THESE SACRIFICIAL BUFFALOES THAT ARE THOUGHT TO CARRY PEOPLE 'S SOUL FROM HERE TO THE AFTERLIFE
KelliSwazey_2013P AND CHILDREN WILL EXPLAIN THAT THEY WILL INVEST THE MONEY IN THIS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO REPAY THEIR PARENTS THE DEBT
KelliSwazey_2013P FOR ALL OF THE YEARS THEIR PARENTS SPENT INVESTING AND CARING FOR THEM
KelliSwazey_2013P BUT THE SACRIFICE OF BUFFALO AND THE RITUAL DISPLAY OF WEALTH ALSO EXHIBITS THE STATUS OF THE DECEASED AND BY EXTENSION THE DECEASED 'S FAMILY SO AT FUNERALS RELATIONSHIPS ARE RECONFIRMED BUT ALSO TRANSFORMED
KelliSwazey_2013P IN A RITUAL DRAMA THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE MOST SALIENT FEATURE ABOUT DEATH IN THIS PLACE
KelliSwazey_2013P ITS IMPACT ON LIFE
KelliSwazey_2013P AND THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE LIVING SO ALL OF THIS FOCUS ON DEATH DOESN 'T MEAN THAT TORAJANS DON 'T ASPIRE TO THE IDEAL
KelliSwazey_2013P SO BY HAVING DEATH AS A PART OF THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL FABRIC OF LIFE PEOPLE 'S EVERYDAY DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE
KelliSwazey_2013P AND HIS DEATH WILL BE GREATLY MOURNED
KelliSwazey_2013P BUT I KNOW THAT MY HUSBAND 'S FAMILY LOOKS FORWARD TO THE MOMENT WHEN THEY CAN RITUALLY DISPLAY
KelliSwazey_2013P HIS REMARKABLE PRESENCE HAS MEANT TO THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY CAN RITUALLY RECOUNT HIS LIFE 'S NARRATIVE WEAVING HIS STORY INTO THE HISTORY OF THEIR COMMUNITY
KelliSwazey_2013P PEOPLE ASK ME IF I 'M FRIGHTENED OR REPULSED BY
KelliSwazey_2013P PARTICIPATING IN A CULTURE WHERE THE PHYSICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF DEATH GREET US AT EVERY TURN
KelliSwazey_2013P BUT I SEE SOMETHING PROFOUNDLY TRANSFORMATIVE IN EXPERIENCING DEATH AS A SOCIAL PROCESS AND NOT JUST A BIOLOGICAL ONE
KelliSwazey_2013P IN REALITY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LIVING AND THE DEAD HAS ITS OWN DRAMA IN THE U S HEALTHCARE SYSTEM
KelliSwazey_2013P WHERE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW LONG TO STRETCH THE THREAD OF LIFE ARE MADE BASED ON OUR EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL TIES WITH THE PEOPLE AROUND US NOT JUST ON MEDICINE 'S ABILITY TO PROLONG LIFE
KelliSwazey_2013P ON THE MEANINGS AND THE DEFINITIONS THAT WE ASCRIBE TO DEATH SO I 'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT ANYONE IN THIS AUDIENCE SHOULD RUN OUT AND ADOPT THE TRADITIONS OF THE TORAJANS IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO PUT INTO PLAY IN THE UNITED STATES
KelliSwazey_2013P BUT I WANT TO ASK WHAT WE CAN GAIN FROM SEEING PHYSICAL DEATH NOT ONLY AS A BIOLOGICAL PROCESS BUT AS PART OF THE GREATER HUMAN STORY
KelliSwazey_2013P WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE TO LOOK ON THE EXPIRED HUMAN FORM WITH LOVE
KelliSwazey_2013P BECAUSE IT 'S SO INTIMATELY A PART OF WHO WE ALL ARE
KelliSwazey_2013P IF WE COULD EXPAND OUR DEFINITION OF DEATH TO ENCOMPASS LIFE
KelliSwazey_2013P WITH SOMETHING OTHER THAN FEAR
KelliSwazey_2013P IT MIGHT HELP US RECOGNIZE THAT THE WAY WE LIMIT OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT DEATH TO SOMETHING THAT 'S MEDICAL OR BIOLOGICAL IS REFLECTIVE OF A LARGER CULTURE THAT WE ALL SHARE
KelliSwazey_2013P IF WE COULD ENTERTAIN AND VALUE
KelliSwazey_2013P OTHER KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LIFE
KelliSwazey_2013P INCLUDING OTHER DEFINITIONS OF DEATH IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT THE END OF LIFE
KelliSwazey_2013P IT COULD CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE DIE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT COULD TRANSFORM
KelliSwazey_2013P THE WAY THAT WE LIVE
