DianaNyad_2011P@93.3:102.23 FOR ME TO CHASE AN ELEVATED DREAM AN EXTREME DREAM SOMETHING THAT WOULD REQUIRE
DianaNyad_2011P@105.77:119.91 AND UNWAVERING PASSION SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE ME BE MY BEST SELF IN EVERY ASPECT OF MY LIFE EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY BECAUSE THE DREAM WAS SO BIG THAT I COULDN 'T GET

DianaNyad_2011P@166.83:173.44 AND I HAD KEPT IN GOOD SHAPE BUT SWIMMING 'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT ANIMAL AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS PICTURE IS SUPPOSED TO BE ME
DianaNyad_2011P@173.44:180.04 DURING TRAINING IT 'S A SMILING FACE AND WHEN YOU 'RE TRAINING FOR THIS SPORT YOU ARE NOT SMILING
DianaNyad_2011P@186.79:189.91 ANY TIME DURING THIS SPORT
DianaNyad_2011P@190.09:205.14 AS I SAID I RESPECT OTHER SPORTS AND I COMPARE THIS SPORT SOMETIMES TO CYCLING AND TO MOUNTAIN CLIMBING AND OTHER OF THE EXPEDITION TYPE EVENTS BUT THIS IS A SENSORY DEPRIVATION A PHYSICAL DURESS
DianaNyad_2011P@205.14:213.05 AND WHEN I STARTED IN WITH THE EIGHT HOURS AND THE TEN HOURS AND THE TWELVE HOURS AND THE FOURTEEN HOURS AND THE FIFTEEN HOURS AND THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR SWIMS

DianaNyad_2011P@424.06:434.11 THAT NOBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD CAN DO THIS SWIM AND I KNEW I COULD DO IT AND WHEN I JUMPED INTO THAT WATER I YELLED IN MY MOTHER 'S FRENCH
DianaNyad_2011P@441.1:450.35 THIS WAS IT THIS WAS OUR TIME AND I REMINDED MYSELF A COUPLE HOURS IN YOU KNOW THE SPORT IS SORT OF A MICROCOSM OF LIFE ITSELF

DianaNyad_2011P@660.86:670.95 BACK IN AND I SWAM THROUGH THAT NIGHT AND INTO THE NEXT DAY AND AT FORTY ONE HOURS THIS BODY COULDN 'T MAKE IT
DianaNyad_2011P@671.36:680.85 THE DEVASTATION OF THOSE STINGS HAD TAKEN THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM DOWN SO THAT I COULDN 'T MAKE THE PROGRESS I WANTED AND THE DREAM WAS CRUSHED
DianaNyad_2011P@680.85:697.93 AND HOW ODD IS THIS INTELLIGENT PERSON WHO PUT THIS TOGETHER AND GOT ALL THESE WORLD EXPERTS TOGETHER AND I KNEW ABOUT THE JELLYFISH BUT I WAS SORT OF CAVALIER A LOT OF ATHLETES HAVE THIS YOU KNOW SORT OF

DianaNyad_2011P@881.64:893.55 IF THERE 'S DEATH AND WE HAVE NO CHOICE THEN GRACE AND ACCEPTANCE ARE NECESSARY BUT THAT OCEAN 'S STILL THERE THIS HOPE IS STILL ALIVE
