VanJones_2010X@20.31:30.75 I AM HONORED TO BE HERE AND I'M HONORED TO TALK ABOUT THIS TOPIC WHICH I THINK IS OF GRAVE IMPORTANCE WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE HORRIFIC IMPACTS OF PLASTIC ON THE PLANET
VanJones_2010X@31.11:36.69 AND ON OTHER SPECIES BUT PLASTIC HURTS PEOPLE TOO ESPECIALLY POOR PEOPLE
VanJones_2010X@37.52:49.89 AND BOTH IN THE PRODUCTION OF PLASTIC THE USE OF PLASTIC AND THE DISPOSAL OF PLASTIC THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BULL 'S EYE ON THEIR FOREHEADS ARE POOR PEOPLE PEOPLE GOT VERY UPSET
VanJones_2010X@50.69:60.60 WHEN THE BP OIL SPILL HAPPENED FOR VERY GOOD REASON PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT OH MY GOD THIS IS TERRIBLE THIS OIL IT'S IN THE WATER IT'S GOING TO DESTROY
VanJones_2010X@61.59:68.43 THE LIVING SYSTEMS THERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE HURT THIS IS A TERRIBLE THING THAT THE OIL IS GOING TO HURT THE PEOPLE IN THE GULF
VanJones_2010X@68.99:76.49 WHAT PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT IS WHAT IF THE OIL HAD MADE IT SAFELY TO SHORE WHAT IF THE OIL ACTUALLY GOT WHERE IT WAS TRYING TO GO
VanJones_2010X@77.13:84.05 NOT ONLY WOULD IT HAVE BEEN BURNED IN ENGINES AND ADDED TO GLOBAL WARMING BUT THERE'S A PLACE CALLED CANCER ALLEY
VanJones_2010X@84.52:93.68 AND THE REASON IT'S CALLED CANCER ALLEY IS BECAUSE THE PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY TAKES THAT OIL AND TURNS IT INTO PLASTIC AND IN THE PROCESS KILLS PEOPLE
VanJones_2010X@94.15:102.50 IT SHORTENS THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE IN THE GULF SO OIL AND PETROCHEMICALS ARE NOT JUST A PROBLEM WHEN THERE'S A SPILL THEY'RE A PROBLEM WHEN THERE'S NOT
VanJones_2010X@114.46:121.38 ALSO SUFFER AT THE POINT OF USE THOSE OF US WHO EARN A CERTAIN INCOME LEVEL WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED CHOICE
VanJones_2010X@126.27:134.87 SO YOU CAN HAVE CHOICES ECONOMIC CHOICES WE ACTUALLY GET A CHANCE TO CHOOSE NOT TO USE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE DANGEROUS POISONOUS PLASTIC IN THEM
VanJones_2010X@135.18:141.57 OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR DON'T HAVE THOSE CHOICES SO LOW INCOME PEOPLE OFTEN ARE THE ONES WHO ARE BUYING THE PRODUCTS THAT
VanJones_2010X@142.18:152.35 HAVE THOSE DANGEROUS CHEMICALS IN THEM THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE USING THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WIND UP INGESTING A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THIS POISONOUS PLASTIC AND USING IT AND PEOPLE SAY WELL THEY
VanJones_2010X@153.99:162.52 A DIFFERENT PRODUCT WELL THE PROBLEM WITH BEING POOR IS YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE CHOICES YOU OFTEN HAVE TO BUY THE CHEAPEST PRODUCTS THE CHEAPEST PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN THE MOST DANGEROUS
VanJones_2010X@175.29:181.99 ONCE AGAIN IT'S POOR PEOPLE WHO BEAR THE BURDEN OFTEN WE THINK WE'RE DOING A GOOD THING YOU'RE IN YOUR OFFICE
VanJones_2010X@190.35:203.37 PUT IT IN THE BLUE BIN YOU THINK I PUT MINE IN THE BLUE BIN AND THEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR COLLEAGUE AND SAY WHY YOU CRETIN YOU PUT YOURS IN THE WHITE BIN AND WE USE THAT AS A MORAL TICKLE WE FEEL SO GOOD ABOUT
VanJones_2010X@211.74:224.68 SO WE KIND OF HAVE THIS KIND OF MORAL FEEL GOOD MOMENT BUT IF WE WERE TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THAT LITTLE BOTTLE ON ITS JOURNEY WE WOULD BE SHOCKED TO DISCOVER THAT ALL TOO OFTEN THAT BOTTLE IS GOING TO BE PUT ON A BOAT
VanJones_2010X@235.05:244.49 LITTLE BOTTLE SAY OH LITTLE BOTTLE WE'RE SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU LITTLE BOTTLE YOU 'VE SERVED SO WELL
VanJones_2010X@255.15:256.23 BUT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY WHAT
VanJones_2010X@259.96:267.88 THAT BOTTLE WINDS UP GETTING BURNED RECYCLING OF PLASTIC IN MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
VanJones_2010X@275.83:290.24 AND SO POOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING THESE PRODUCTS IN PETROCHEMICAL CENTERS LIKE CANCER ALLEY POOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSUMING THESE PRODUCTS DISPROPORTIONATELY AND THEN POOR PEOPLE WHO EVEN AT THE TAIL END OF THE RECYCLING ARE HAVING THEIR LIVES SHORTENED
VanJones_2010X@290.64:297.80 ARE ALL BEING HARMED GREATLY BY THIS ADDICTION THAT WE HAVE
VanJones_2010X@297.96:305.67 TO DISPOSABILITY NOW YOU THINK TO YOURSELF BECAUSE I KNOW HOW YOU ARE YOU SAY THAT SURE IS TERRIBLE FOR THOSE POOR PEOPLE
VanJones_2010X@316.04:328.77 HERE WE ARE IN LOS ANGELES WE WORKED VERY HARD TO GET THE SMOG REDUCTION HAPPENING HERE IN LOS ANGELES BUT GUESS WHAT BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING SO MUCH DIRTY PRODUCTION IN ASIA NOW BECAUSE THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS DON'T PROTECT THE PEOPLE IN ASIA
VanJones_2010X@330.11:338.65 ALMOST ALL OF THE CLEAN AIR GAINS AND THE TOXIC AIR GAINS THAT WE'VE ACHIEVED HERE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT BY DIRTY AIR COMING OVER FROM ASIA
VanJones_2010X@340.07:352.53 SO WE ALL ARE BEING HIT WE ALL ARE BEING IMPACTED IT'S JUST THE POOR PEOPLE GET HIT FIRST AND WORST BUT THE DIRTY PRODUCTION THE BURNING OF TOXINS THE LACK OF ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS IN ASIA IS ACTUALLY CREATING SO MUCH DIRTY
VanJones_2010X@364.13:372.88 THE ROOT OF THIS PROBLEM IN MY VIEW IS THE IDEA OF DISPOSABILITY ITSELF YOU SEE IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE LINK
VanJones_2010X@373.30:383.75 BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE DOING TO POISON AND POLLUTE THE PLANET AND WHAT WE'RE DOING TO POOR PEOPLE YOU ARRIVE AT A VERY TROUBLING BUT ALSO VERY HELPFUL INSIGHT
VanJones_2010X@384.42:391.69 IN ORDER TO TRASH THE PLANET YOU HAVE TO TRASH PEOPLE BUT IF YOU CREATE A WORLD WHERE YOU DON'T TRASH PEOPLE
VanJones_2010X@391.83:400.59 YOU CAN'T TRASH THE PLANET SO NOW WE ARE AT A MOMENT WHERE THE COMING TOGETHER OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AS AN IDEA AND ECOLOGY AS AN IDEA
VanJones_2010X@401.46:409.95 WE FINALLY CAN NOW SEE THAT THEY ARE REALLY AT THE END OF THE DAY ONE IDEA AND IT'S THE IDEA THAT WE DON'T HAVE DISPOSABLE ANYTHING WE DON'T HAVE DISPOSABLE
VanJones_2010X@421.72:431.59 ALL BEGIN TO COME BACK TO THAT BASIC UNDERSTANDING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACTION BEGIN TO EMERGE BIOMIMICRY WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT
VanJones_2010X@431.77:442.71 IS AN EMERGING SCIENCE WINDS UP BEING A VERY IMPORTANT SOCIAL JUSTICE IDEA PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST LEARNING ABOUT THIS STUFF BIOMIMICRY MEANS RESPECTING THE WISDOM OF ALL SPECIES
VanJones_2010X@455.99:467.07 BUT IF WE WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING HARD WE COME UP I KNOW I'M GOING TO MAKE A HARD SUBSTANCE I KNOW I'M GOING TO GET VACUUMS AND FURNACES AND DRAG STUFF OUT OF THE GROUND AND GET THINGS HOT
VanJones_2010X@515.29:522.38 THAT'S CALLED BIOMIMICRY AND THAT OPENS THE DOOR TO ZERO WASTE PRODUCTION ZERO POLLUTION PRODUCTION
VanJones_2010X@523.26:529.93 ACTUALLY ENJOY A HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE A HIGH STANDARD OF LIVING WITHOUT TRASHING THE PLANET WELL THAT IDEA
VanJones_2010X@530.47:540.51 OF BIOMIMICRY RESPECTING THE WISDOM OF ALL SPECIES COMBINED WITH THE IDEA OF DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE RESPECTING THE WISDOM AND THE WORTH OF ALL PEOPLE
VanJones_2010X@541.02:550.53 GIVE US A DIFFERENT SOCIETY WE WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT ECONOMY WE WOULD HAVE A GREEN SOCIETY THAT DOCTOR KING WOULD BE PROUD OF THAT SHOULD BE THE GOAL
VanJones_2010X@551.00:558.57 AND THE WAY THAT WE GET THERE IS TO FIRST OF ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THE IDEA OF DISPOSABILITY NOT ONLY HURTS
VanJones_2010X@559.42:569.56 THE SPECIES WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BUT IT EVEN CORRUPTS OUR OWN SOCIETY WE'RE SO PROUD TO LIVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE JUST HAD THIS VOTE AND EVERYBODY 'S LIKE WELL NOT IN OUR STATE
VanJones_2010X@572.47:579.72 KNOW WHAT THOSE OTHER STATES WERE DOING JUST SO PROUD AND
VanJones_2010X@580.80:591.90 PROUD TOO BUT CALIFORNIA THOUGH WE LEAD THE WORLD IN SOME OF THE GREEN STUFF WE ALSO UNFORTUNATELY LEAD THE WORLD IN SOME OF THE GULAG STUFF
VanJones_2010X@624.85:633.59 STATES SO THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THIS IDEA THAT DISPOSABILITY IS SOMETHING WE BELIEVE IN AND YET
VanJones_2010X@634.61:643.28 AS A MOVEMENT THAT HAS TO BROADEN ITS CONSTITUENCY THAT HAS TO GROW THAT HAS TO REACH OUT BEYOND OUR NATURAL COMFORT ZONE
VanJones_2010X@643.70:657.89 ONE OF THE CHALLENGES TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS MOVEMENT OF GETTING RID OF THINGS LIKE PLASTIC AND HELPING THE ECONOMY SHIFT IS PEOPLE LOOK AT OUR MOVEMENT WITH SOME SUSPICION AND THEY ASK A QUESTION AND THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN THESE PEOPLE BE SO PASSIONATE
VanJones_2010X@658.95:671.06 POOR PERSON A LOW INCOME PERSON SOMEBODY IN CANCER ALLEY SOMEBODY IN WATTS SOMEBODY IN HARLEM SOMEBODY ON AN INDIAN RESERVATION MIGHT SAY TO THEMSELVES AND RIGHTFULLY SO HOW CAN THESE PEOPLE BE SO PASSIONATE
VanJones_2010X@672.28:684.42 ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT A PLASTIC BOTTLE HAS A SECOND CHANCE IN LIFE OR AN ALUMINUM CAN HAS A SECOND CHANCE AND YET WHEN MY CHILD GETS IN TROUBLE AND GOES TO PRISON
VanJones_2010X@697.02:706.92 AND SO WE NOW GET A CHANCE TO BE TRULY PROUD OF THIS MOVEMENT WHEN WE TAKE ON TOPICS LIKE THIS IT GIVES US THAT EXTRA CALL
VanJones_2010X@707.48:717.77 TO REACH OUT TO OTHER MOVEMENTS AND TO BECOME MORE INCLUSIVE AND TO GROW AND WE CAN FINALLY GET OUT OF THIS CRAZY DILEMMA THAT WE'VE BEEN IN MOST OF YOU ARE GOOD SOFT HEARTED PEOPLE
VanJones_2010X@718.57:727.22 WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER YOU CARED ABOUT THE WHOLE WORLD AND AT SOME POINT SOMEBODY SAID YOU HAD TO PICK AN ISSUE YOU HAD TO BOIL YOUR LOVE DOWN TO AN ISSUE
VanJones_2010X@727.84:736.33 THE WHOLE WORLD YOU'VE GOT TO WORK ON TREES OR YOU'VE GOT TO WORK ON IMMIGRATION YOU'VE GOT TO SHRINK IT DOWN AND BE ABOUT ONE ISSUE AND REALLY
VanJones_2010X@746.72:756.44 WELL WHEN YOU START WORKING ON ISSUES LIKE PLASTIC YOU REALIZE THAT THE WHOLE THING IS CONNECTED AND LUCKILY MOST OF US ARE BLESSED TO HAVE TWO ARMS WE CAN HUG BOTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
