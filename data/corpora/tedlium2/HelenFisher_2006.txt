HelenFisher_2006 TODAY ABOUT THE TWO BIGGEST SOCIAL TRENDS IN THE COMING CENTURY AND PERHAPS IN THE NEXT TEN THOUSAND YEARS
HelenFisher_2006 BUT I WANT TO START WITH MY WORK ON ROMANTIC LOVE BECAUSE THAT'S MY MOST RECENT WORK WHAT I AND MY COLLEAGUES DID WAS TO PUT THIRTY TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE MADLY IN LOVE INTO A FUNCTIONAL MRI BRAIN SCANNER
HelenFisher_2006 TIS TO LOVE SHAKESPEARE SAID I THINK OUR ANCESTORS I THINK HUMAN BEINGS HAVE BEEN WONDERING ABOUT THIS QUESTION SINCE THEY SAT AROUND THEIR CAMPFIRES OR LAY AND WATCHED THE STARS A MILLION YEARS AGO
HelenFisher_2006 I STARTED OUT BY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ROMANTIC LOVE WAS BY LOOKING AT THE LAST FORTY FIVE YEARS OF RESEARCH ON JUST THE PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND AS IT TURNS OUT THERE'S A VERY SPECIFIC GROUP OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHEN YOU FALL IN LOVE
HelenFisher_2006 THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS IS WHAT I CALL A PERSON BEGINS TO TAKE ON WHAT I CALL SPECIAL MEANING AS A TRUCK DRIVER ONCE SAID TO ME HE SAID THE WORLD HAD A NEW CENTER AND THAT CENTER WAS MARY ANNE
HelenFisher_2006 AND THEN YOU JUST FOCUS ON THIS PERSON YOU CAN LIST WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE ABOUT THEM BUT THEN YOU SWEEP THAT ASIDE AND FOCUS ON WHAT YOU DO AS CHAUCER SAID LOVE IS BLIND
HelenFisher_2006 IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ROMANTIC LOVE I DECIDED I WOULD READ POETRY FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD AND I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU ONE VERY SHORT POEM FROM
HelenFisher_2006 EIGHTH CENTURY CHINA BECAUSE IT'S AN ALMOST PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A MAN WHO IS FOCUSED TOTALLY ON A PARTICULAR WOMAN
HelenFisher_2006 IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE WHEN YOU ARE MADLY IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY AND YOU WALK INTO A PARKING LOT THEIR CAR IS DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER CAR IN THE PARKING LOT
HelenFisher_2006 THEIR WINE GLASS AT DINNER IS DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER WINE GLASS AT THE DINNER PARTY AND IN THIS CASE A MAN GOT HOOKED ON A BAMBOO SLEEPING MAT
HelenFisher_2006 AND IT GOES LIKE THIS IT'S BY A GUY CALLED YUAN CHEN I CANNOT BEAR TO PUT AWAY THE BAMBOO SLEEPING MAT THE NIGHT I BROUGHT YOU HOME I WATCHED YOU ROLL IT OUT HE BECAME HOOKED ON A SLEEPING MAT
HelenFisher_2006 YOU FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION ON THEM YOU AGGRANDIZE THEM BUT YOU HAVE INTENSE ENERGY AS ONE POLYNESIAN SAID HE SAID I FELT LIKE JUMPING IN THE SKY
HelenFisher_2006 UP ALL NIGHT YOU'RE WALKING TILL DAWN YOU FEEL INTENSE ELATION WHEN THINGS ARE GOING WELL MOOD SWINGS INTO HORRIBLE DESPAIR WHEN THINGS ARE GOING POORLY
HelenFisher_2006 REAL DEPENDENCE ON THIS PERSON AS ONE BUSINESSMAN IN NEW YORK SAID TO ME HE SAID ANYTHING SHE LIKED I LIKED SIMPLE ROMANTIC LOVE IS VERY SIMPLE
HelenFisher_2006 YOU BECOME EXTREMELY SEXUALLY POSSESSIVE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE JUST SLEEPING WITH SOMEBODY CASUALLY YOU DON'T REALLY CARE IF THEY'RE SLEEPING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE
HelenFisher_2006 BUT THE MOMENT YOU FALL IN LOVE YOU BECOME EXTREMELY SEXUALLY POSSESSIVE OF THEM I THINK THAT THAT IS A DARWINIAN THERE'S A DARWINIAN PURPOSE TO THIS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS IS TO PULL TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER STRONGLY ENOUGH TO BEGIN TO REAR BABIES AS A TEAM
HelenFisher_2006 BUT THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF ROMANTIC LOVE ARE CRAVING AN INTENSE CRAVING TO BE WITH A PARTICULAR PERSON NOT JUST SEXUALLY BUT EMOTIONALLY YOU'D MUCH RATHER
HelenFisher_2006 IT WOULD BE NICE TO GO TO BED WITH THEM BUT YOU WANT THEM TO CALL YOU ON THE TELEPHONE TO INVITE YOU OUT ET CETERA TO TELL YOU THAT THEY LOVE YOU
HelenFisher_2006 THE OTHER MAIN CHARACTERISTIC IS MOTIVATION THE MOTOR IN YOUR BRAIN BEGINS TO CRANK AND YOU WANT THIS PERSON
HelenFisher_2006 AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IT IS AN OBSESSION WHEN I PUT THESE PEOPLE IN THE MACHINE BEFORE I PUT THEM IN THE MRI MACHINE I WOULD ASK THEM ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS
HelenFisher_2006 MY MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION WAS ALWAYS THE SAME IT WAS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE DAY AND NIGHT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS PERSON AND INDEED THEY WOULD SAY
HelenFisher_2006 MY FINAL QUESTION WAS ALWAYS THE SAME I WOULD SAY WOULD YOU DIE FOR HIM OR HER AND INDEED THESE PEOPLE WOULD SAY YES AS IF I HAD ASKED THEM TO PASS THE SALT I WAS JUST STAGGERED BY
HelenFisher_2006 SO WE SCANNED THEIR BRAINS LOOKING AT A PHOTOGRAPH OF THEIR SWEETHEART AND LOOKING AT A NEUTRAL PHOTOGRAPH WITH A DISTRACTION TASK IN BETWEEN SO WE COULD FIND
HelenFisher_2006 LOOK AT THE SAME BRAIN WHEN IT WAS IN THAT HEIGHTENED STATE AND WHEN IT WAS IN A RESTING STATE AND WE FOUND ACTIVITY IN A LOT OF BRAIN REGIONS
HelenFisher_2006 IN FACT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WAS A BRAIN REGION THAT BECOMES ACTIVE WHEN YOU FEEL THE RUSH OF COCAINE AND INDEED THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS
HelenFisher_2006 I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT ROMANTIC LOVE IS NOT AN EMOTION IN FACT I HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS A SERIES OF EMOTIONS FROM VERY HIGH TO VERY LOW BUT ACTUALLY IT'S A DRIVE IT COMES FROM THE MOTOR OF THE MIND
HelenFisher_2006 THE WANTING PART OF THE MIND THE CRAVING PART OF THE MIND THE KIND OF MIND PART OF THE MIND WHEN YOU'RE REACHING FOR THAT PIECE OF CHOCOLATE WHEN YOU WANT TO WIN
HelenFisher_2006 THAT PROMOTION AT WORK THE MOTOR OF THE BRAIN IT'S A DRIVE AND IN FACT I THINK IT'S MORE POWERFUL THAN THE SEX DRIVE
HelenFisher_2006 YOU KNOW IF YOU ASK SOMEBODY TO GO TO BED WITH YOU AND THEY SAY NO THANK YOU YOU CERTAINLY DON'T KILL YOURSELF OR SLIP INTO A CLINICAL DEPRESSION BUT CERTAINLY AROUND THE WORLD
HelenFisher_2006 PEOPLE WHO ARE REJECTED IN LOVE WILL KILL FOR IT PEOPLE LIVE FOR LOVE THEY KILL FOR LOVE THEY DIE FOR LOVE
HelenFisher_2006 THEY HAVE SONGS POEMS NOVELS SCULPTURES PAINTINGS MYTHS LEGENDS
HelenFisher_2006 IN OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE SOCIETIES PEOPLE HAVE LEFT THEIR EVIDENCE OF THIS POWERFUL BRAIN SYSTEM I HAVE COME TO THINK IT'S ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL BRAIN SYSTEMS ON EARTH FOR BOTH GREAT JOY AND GREAT SORROW
HelenFisher_2006 I'VE ALSO COME TO THINK THAT IT'S ONE OF THREE BASICALLY DIFFERENT BRAIN SYSTEMS THAT EVOLVED FROM MATING AND REPRODUCTION ONE IS THE SEX DRIVE THE CRAVING FOR SEXUAL GRATIFICATION
HelenFisher_2006 H AUDEN CALLED IT AN INTOLERABLE NEURAL ITCH AND INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT IS IT KEEPS BOTHERING YOU A LITTLE BIT LIKE BEING HUNGRY
HelenFisher_2006 THE SECOND OF THESE THREE BRAIN SYSTEMS IS ROMANTIC LOVE THAT ELATION OBSESSION OF EARLY LOVE AND THE THIRD BRAIN SYSTEM IS ATTACHMENT THAT SENSE OF CALM AND SECURITY YOU CAN FEEL FOR A LONG TERM PARTNER
HelenFisher_2006 AND I THINK THAT THE SEX DRIVE EVOLVED TO GET YOU OUT THERE LOOKING FOR A WHOLE RANGE OF PARTNERS YOU KNOW YOU CAN FEEL IT WHEN YOU'RE JUST DRIVING ALONG IN YOUR CAR IT CAN BE FOCUSED ON NOBODY
HelenFisher_2006 I THINK ROMANTIC LOVE EVOLVED TO ENABLE YOU TO FOCUS YOUR MATING ENERGY ON JUST ONE INDIVIDUAL AT A TIME THEREBY CONSERVING MATING TIME AND ENERGY
HelenFisher_2006 AND I THINK THAT ATTACHMENT THE THIRD BRAIN SYSTEM EVOLVED TO ENABLE YOU TO TOLERATE THIS HUMAN BEING AT LEAST LONG ENOUGH TO RAISE A CHILD TOGETHER AS A TEAM
HelenFisher_2006 SO WITH THAT PREAMBLE I WANT TO GO INTO DISCUSSING THE TWO MOST PROFOUND SOCIAL TRENDS ONE OF THE LAST TEN THOUSAND YEARS AND THE OTHER CERTAINLY
HelenFisher_2006 THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THESE THREE DIFFERENT BRAIN SYSTEMS LUST
HelenFisher_2006 I'VE LOOKED AT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SOCIETIES THROUGH THE DEMOGRAPHIC YEARBOOKS OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD
HelenFisher_2006 ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE OUT OF ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY OF THEM WOMEN ARE NOT ONLY MOVING INTO THE JOB MARKET SOMETIMES VERY VERY SLOWLY
HelenFisher_2006 BUT THEY ARE MOVING INTO THE JOB MARKET AND THEY ARE VERY SLOWLY CLOSING THAT GAP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC POWER HEALTH AND EDUCATION
HelenFisher_2006 VERY SLOW FOR EVERY TREND IN ON THIS PLANET THERE'S A COUNTER TREND WE ALL KNOW OF THEM BUT NEVERTHELESS THE OLD ARAB SAYING THE ARABS SAY
HelenFisher_2006 THE DOGS MAY BARK BUT THE CARAVAN MOVES ON AND INDEED THAT CARAVAN IS MOVING ON WOMEN ARE MOVING BACK INTO THE JOB MARKET
HelenFisher_2006 AND I SAY BACK INTO THE JOB MARKET BECAUSE THIS IS NOT NEW FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS ON THE GRASSLANDS OF AFRICA WOMEN COMMUTED TO WORK
HelenFisher_2006 WOMEN 'S WORST INVENTION WAS THE PLOW WITH THE BEGINNING OF PLOW AGRICULTURE MEN 'S ROLES BECAME EXTREMELY POWERFUL WOMEN LOST THEIR ANCIENT
HelenFisher_2006 JOBS AS COLLECTORS BUT THEN WITH THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND THE POST INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION THEY'RE MOVING BACK INTO THE JOB MARKET
HelenFisher_2006 IN SHORT THEY ARE ACQUIRING THE STATUS THAT THEY HAD A MILLION YEARS AGO TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO
HelenFisher_2006 WE ARE SEEING NOW ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE TRADITIONS IN THE HISTORY OF THE HUMAN ANIMAL
HelenFisher_2006 AND IT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT I GENERALLY GIVE A WHOLE LECTURE ON THE IMPACT OF WOMEN ON THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY I'LL ONLY JUST SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS AND THEN GO ON TO SEX AND LOVE
HelenFisher_2006 A LOT OF GENDER DIFFERENCES ANYBODY WHO THINKS MEN AND WOMEN ARE ALIKE SIMPLY NEVER HAD A BOY AND A GIRL CHILD I DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS THAT THEY WANT TO THINK THAT MEN AND WOMEN ARE ALIKE
HelenFisher_2006 MUCH WE HAVE IN COMMON BUT THERE'S A WHOLE LOT THAT WE ARE NOT DO NOT HAVE IN COMMON WE ARE IN THE WORDS OF TED HUGHES I THINK THAT WE WERE BUILT TO BE WE'RE LIKE TWO FEET WE NEED EACH OTHER TO GET AHEAD
HelenFisher_2006 WE DID NOT EVOLVE TO HAVE THE SAME BRAIN AND WE'RE FINDING MORE AND MORE AND MORE GENDER DIFFERENCES IN THE BRAIN I'LL ONLY JUST USE A COUPLE AND THEN MOVE ON TO SEX AND LOVE ONE OF THEM IS WOMEN 'S VERBAL ABILITY WOMEN CAN TALK
HelenFisher_2006 WOMEN 'S ABILITY TO FIND THE RIGHT WORD RAPIDLY BASIC ARTICULATION GOES UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE WHEN ESTROGEN LEVELS PEAK BUT EVEN AT MENSTRUATION THEY'RE BETTER THAN THE AVERAGE MAN
HelenFisher_2006 WOMEN CAN TALK THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR A MILLION YEARS WORDS WERE WOMEN 'S TOOLS THEY HELD THAT BABY IN FRONT OF THEIR FACE CAJOLING IT REPRIMANDING IT EDUCATING IT
HelenFisher_2006 WITH WORDS AND INDEED THEY'RE BECOMING A VERY POWERFUL FORCE EVEN IN PLACES LIKE INDIA AND
HelenFisher_2006 JAPAN WHERE WOMEN ARE NOT MOVING RAPIDLY INTO THE REGULAR JOB MARKET THEY'RE MOVING INTO JOURNALISM AND I THINK THAT
HelenFisher_2006 THE PRODUCERS WHO CALL ME WHO NEGOTIATE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SAY IS A WOMAN IN FACT SOLZHENITSYN ONCE SAID
HelenFisher_2006 ONE OF MANY MANY CHARACTERISTICS THAT WOMEN HAVE THAT THEY WILL BRING INTO THE JOB MARKET THEY'VE GOT INCREDIBLE PEOPLE SKILLS NEGOTIATING SKILLS THEY'RE HIGHLY IMAGINATIVE WE NOW KNOW THE BRAIN CIRCUITRY OF IMAGINATION
HelenFisher_2006 OF LONG TERM PLANNING THEY TEND TO BE WEB THINKERS BECAUSE THE FEMALE PARTS OF THE BRAIN ARE BETTER CONNECTED THEY TEND TO COLLECT MORE PIECES OF DATA WHEN THEY THINK
HelenFisher_2006 PUT THEM INTO MORE COMPLEX PATTERNS SEE MORE OPTIONS AND OUTCOMES THEY TEND TO BE CONTEXTUAL HOLISTIC THINKERS WHAT I CALL WEB THINKERS MEN TEND TO AND THESE ARE AVERAGES
HelenFisher_2006 THINKING PATTERN THEY'RE BOTH PERFECTLY GOOD WAYS OF THINKING WE NEED BOTH OF THEM TO GET AHEAD IN FACT THERE'S MANY MORE MALE GENIUSES IN THE WORLD WHEN THE AND THERE'S ALSO MANY MORE MALE IDIOTS IN THE WORLD
HelenFisher_2006 WHEN THE MALE BRAIN WORKS WELL IT WORKS EXTREMELY WELL AND I WHAT I REALLY THINK THAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS A COLLABORATIVE SOCIETY A SOCIETY IN WHICH THE
HelenFisher_2006 WOMEN MOVING INTO THE JOB MARKET IS HAVING A HUGE IMPACT ON SEX AND ROMANCE AND FAMILY LIFE FOREMOST
HelenFisher_2006 WOMEN ARE STARTING TO EXPRESS THEIR SEXUALITY I'M ALWAYS ASTONISHED WHEN PEOPLE COME TO ME AND SAY
HelenFisher_2006 WHY IS IT THAT MEN ARE SO ADULTEROUS AND I SAY WHY DO YOU THINK MORE MEN ARE ADULTEROUS THAN WOMEN OH WELL MEN ARE MORE ADULTEROUS AND I SAY WHO DO YOU THINK THESE MEN ARE SLEEPING WITH
HelenFisher_2006 MATH ANYWAY IN THE WESTERN WORLD LITTLE GIRLS START WOMEN START SOONER AT SEX HAVE MORE PARTNERS EXPRESS LESS REMORSE FOR THE PARTNERS THAT THEY DO
HelenFisher_2006 MARRY LATER HAVE FEWER CHILDREN LEAVE BAD MARRIAGES IN ORDER TO GET GOOD ONES WE ARE SEEING THE RISE OF FEMALE SEXUAL EXPRESSION AND INDEED ONCE AGAIN WE'RE MOVING FORWARD TO THE KIND OF SEXUAL EXPRESSION
HelenFisher_2006 THAT WE PROBABLY SAW ON THE GRASSLANDS OF AFRICA A MILLION YEARS AGO BECAUSE THIS IS THE KIND OF SEXUAL EXPRESSION THAT WE SEE IN HUNTING AND GATHERING SOCIETIES TODAY WE'RE ALSO RETURNING TO AN ANCIENT FORM OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY
HelenFisher_2006 THEY'RE NOW SAYING THAT THE TWENTY ONE ST CENTURY IS GOING TO BE THE CENTURY OF WHAT THEY CALL THE SYMMETRICAL MARRIAGE OR THE PURE MARRIAGE
HelenFisher_2006 OR THE COMPANIONATE MARRIAGE THIS IS A MARRIAGE BETWEEN EQUALS MOVING FORWARD TO A PATTERN THAT IS HIGHLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE ANCIENT HUMAN SPIRIT
HelenFisher_2006 WE'RE ALSO SEEING A RISE OF ROMANTIC LOVE NINETY ONE PERCENT OF AMERICAN WOMEN AND EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF AMERICAN MEN WOULD NOT MARRY SOMEBODY
HelenFisher_2006 WHO HAD EVERY SINGLE QUALITY THEY WERE LOOKING FOR IN A PARTNER IF THEY WERE NOT IN LOVE WITH THAT PERSON PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD IN A STUDY OF THIRTY SEVEN SOCIETIES WANT TO BE IN LOVE
HelenFisher_2006 WITH THE PERSON THAT THEY MARRY INDEED ARRANGED MARRIAGES ARE ON THEIR WAY OFF THIS BRAID OF HUMAN LIFE
HelenFisher_2006 I EVEN THINK THAT MARRIAGES MIGHT EVEN BECOME MORE STABLE BECAUSE OF THE SECOND GREAT WORLD TREND THE FIRST ONE BEING WOMEN MOVING INTO THE JOB MARKET THE SECOND ONE BEING THE AGING WORLD POPULATION THEY'RE NOW SAYING THAT IN AMERICA
HelenFisher_2006 THAT MIDDLE AGE SHOULD BE REGARDED AS UP TO AGE EIGHTY FIVE BECAUSE IN THAT HIGHEST AGE CATEGORY OF SEVENTY SIX TO EIGHTY FIVE ONLY
HelenFisher_2006 AS MUCH AS FORTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE HAVE NOTHING REALLY WRONG WITH THEM SO WE'RE SEEING THERE'S A REAL EXTENSION OF MIDDLE AGE AND I LOOKED
HelenFisher_2006 FOR ONE OF MY BOOKS I LOOKED AT DIVORCE DATA IN FIFTY EIGHT SOCIETIES AND AS IT TURNS OUT THE OLDER YOU GET THE LESS LIKELY YOU ARE TO DIVORCE
HelenFisher_2006 SO THE DIVORCE RATE RIGHT NOW IS STABLE IN AMERICA AND IT'S ACTUALLY BEGINNING TO DECLINE IT MAY DECLINE SOME MORE
HelenFisher_2006 I WOULD EVEN SAY THAT WITH VIAGRA ESTROGEN REPLACEMENT HIP REPLACEMENTS
HelenFisher_2006 AND THE INCREDIBLY INTERESTING WOMEN WOMEN HAVE NEVER BEEN AS INTERESTING AS THEY ARE NOW NOT AT ANY TIME ON THIS PLANET HAVE WOMEN BEEN SO EDUCATED SO INTERESTING SO CAPABLE
HelenFisher_2006 AND SO I HONESTLY THINK THAT IF THERE REALLY WAS EVER A TIME IN HUMAN EVOLUTION WHEN WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE GOOD MARRIAGES THAT TIME IS NOW
HelenFisher_2006 HOWEVER THERE'S ALWAYS KINDS OF COMPLICATIONS IN THIS IN THESE THREE BRAIN SYSTEMS LUST ROMANTIC LOVE AND ATTACHMENT DON'T ALWAYS GO TOGETHER
HelenFisher_2006 THEY CAN GO TOGETHER BY THE WAY THAT'S WHY CASUAL SEX ISN'T SO CASUAL WITH ORGASM YOU GET A SPIKE OF DOPAMINE DOPAMINE 'S ASSOCIATED WITH ROMANTIC LOVE AND YOU CAN JUST FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY WHO YOU'RE JUST HAVING CASUAL SEX WITH
HelenFisher_2006 WITH ORGASM THEN YOU GET A REAL RUSH OF OXYTOCIN AND VASOPRESSIN THOSE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ATTACHMENT THIS IS WHY YOU CAN FEEL SUCH A SENSE OF COSMIC UNION WITH SOMEBODY AFTER YOU'VE MADE LOVE TO THEM BUT THESE THREE BRAIN SYSTEMS
HelenFisher_2006 LUST ROMANTIC LOVE AND ATTACHMENT AREN'T ALWAYS CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER YOU CAN FEEL DEEP ATTACHMENT TO A LONG TERM PARTNER WHILE YOU FEEL
HelenFisher_2006 INTENSE ROMANTIC LOVE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE WHILE YOU FEEL THE SEX DRIVE FOR PEOPLE UNRELATED TO THESE OTHER PARTNERS IN SHORT WE'RE CAPABLE OF LOVING MORE THAN ONE PERSON
HelenFisher_2006 AT A TIME IN FACT YOU CAN LIE IN BED AT NIGHT AND SWING FROM DEEP FEELINGS OF ATTACHMENT FOR ONE PERSON TO DEEP FEELINGS OF ROMANTIC LOVE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE IT'S AS IF THERE'S A COMMITTEE MEETING GOING ON IN YOUR HEAD
HelenFisher_2006 AS YOU ARE TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO SO I DON'T THINK HONESTLY WE'RE AN ANIMAL THAT WAS BUILT TO BE HAPPY WE ARE AN ANIMAL THAT WAS BUILT TO REPRODUCE I THINK THE HAPPINESS WE FIND WE MAKE AND
HelenFisher_2006 I THINK HOWEVER WE CAN MAKE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH OTHER SO I WANT TO CONCLUDE WITH TWO THINGS I WANT TO CONCLUDE WITH A WORRY I HAVE A WORRY AND WITH A WONDERFUL STORY
HelenFisher_2006 THE WORRY IS ABOUT ANTIDEPRESSANTS OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION PRESCRIPTIONS OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS ARE
HelenFisher_2006 WRITTEN EVERY YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES AND THESE DRUGS ARE GOING GENERIC THEY ARE SEEPING AROUND THE WORLD
HelenFisher_2006 I KNOW ONE GIRL WHO 'S BEEN ON THESE ANTIDEPRESSANTS SEROTONIN ENHANCING SSRI SEROTONIN ENHANCING ANTIDEPRESSANTS SINCE SHE WAS THIRTEEN SHE'S TWENTY THREE SHE'S BEEN ON THEM EVER SINCE SHE WAS THIRTEEN I'VE GOT NOTHING AGAINST PEOPLE WHO
HelenFisher_2006 TAKE THEM SHORT TERM WHEN THEY'RE GOING THROUGH SOMETHING PERFECTLY HORRIBLE THEY WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE OR KILL SOMEBODY ELSE I WOULD RECOMMEND IT BUT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES
HelenFisher_2006 ARE TAKING THEM LONG TERM AND INDEED WHAT THESE DRUGS DO IS RAISE LEVELS OF SEROTONIN
HelenFisher_2006 AND BY RAISING LEVELS OF SEROTONIN YOU SUPPRESS THE DOPAMINE CIRCUIT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT DOPAMINE IS ASSOCIATED WITH ROMANTIC LOVE
HelenFisher_2006 NOT ONLY DO THEY SUPPRESS THE DOPAMINE CIRCUIT BUT THEY KILL THE SEX DRIVE AND WHEN YOU KILL THE SEX DRIVE
HelenFisher_2006 YOU KILL ORGASM AND WHEN YOU KILL ORGASM YOU KILL THAT FLOOD OF DRUGS ASSOCIATED WITH ATTACHMENT
HelenFisher_2006 THE THINGS ARE CONNECTED IN THE BRAIN AND WHEN YOU TAMPER WITH ONE BRAIN SYSTEM YOU'RE GOING TO TAMPER WITH ANOTHER I'M JUST SIMPLY SAYING THAT A WORLD WITHOUT LOVE IS A DEADLY PLACE SO NOW
HelenFisher_2006 THANK YOU
HelenFisher_2006 WITH A STORY AND THEN JUST A COMMENT I'VE BEEN STUDYING ROMANTIC LOVE AND
HelenFisher_2006 SEX AND ATTACHMENT FOR THIRTY YEARS I'M AN IDENTICAL TWIN I AM INTERESTED IN WHY WE'RE ALL ALIKE
HelenFisher_2006 WHY YOU AND I ARE ALIKE WHY THE IRAQIS AND THE JAPANESE AND THE AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES AND THE PEOPLE OF THE AMAZON RIVER ARE ALL ALIKE AND ABOUT A YEAR AGO AN INTERNET DATING SERVICE MATCH COM CAME TO ME AND ASKED ME
HelenFisher_2006 IF I WOULD DESIGN A NEW DATING SITE FOR THEM I SAID I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PERSONALITY YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW DO YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT PERSON THEY SAID YES IT GOT ME THINKING
HelenFisher_2006 ABOUT WHY IT IS THAT YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH ONE PERSON RATHER THAN ANOTHER THAT'S MY CURRENT PROJECT IT WILL BE MY NEXT BOOK
HelenFisher_2006 THERE'S ALL KINDS OF REASONS THAT YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH ONE PERSON RATHER THAN ANOTHER TIMING IS IMPORTANT PROXIMITY IS IMPORTANT
HelenFisher_2006 I ALSO THINK THAT YOU BECOME GRAVITATE TO CERTAIN PEOPLE ACTUALLY WITH SOMEWHAT COMPLEMENTARY BRAIN SYSTEMS AND THAT'S WHAT I'M NOW CONTRIBUTING TO THIS BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT
HelenFisher_2006 TO ILLUSTRATE I'VE BEEN CARRYING ON HERE ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF LOVE I WANTED TO SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CULTURE OF IT TOO THE MAGIC OF IT
HelenFisher_2006 IT'S A STORY THAT WAS TOLD TO ME BY SOMEBODY WHO HAD HEARD IT JUST FROM ONE OF THE PROBABLY A TRUE STORY
HelenFisher_2006 IT WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT AT I'M AT RUTGERS AND MY TWO COLLEAGUES ART ARON IS AT SUNY STONY BROOK THAT'S WHERE WE PUT OUR PEOPLE IN THE MRI MACHINE
HelenFisher_2006 AND THIS GRADUATE STUDENT WAS MADLY IN LOVE WITH ANOTHER GRADUATE STUDENT AND SHE WAS NOT IN LOVE WITH HIM
HelenFisher_2006 AND THEY WERE ALL AT A CONFERENCE IN BEIJING AND HE KNEW FROM OUR WORK THAT
HelenFisher_2006 IF YOU GO AND DO SOMETHING VERY NOVEL WITH SOMEBODY YOU CAN DRIVE UP THE DOPAMINE IN THE BRAIN AND PERHAPS TRIGGER THIS BRAIN SYSTEM FOR ROMANTIC LOVE
HelenFisher_2006 SO HE DECIDED HE'D PUT SCIENCE TO WORK AND HE INVITED THIS GIRL TO GO OFF ON A RICKSHAW RIDE WITH
HelenFisher_2006 AND SURE ENOUGH I'VE NEVER BEEN IN ONE BUT APPARENTLY THEY GO ALL AROUND THE BUSES AND THE TRUCKS AND IT'S CRAZY AND IT'S NOISY AND IT'S EXCITING AND
HelenFisher_2006 AND HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME AN HOUR LATER THEY GET DOWN OFF OF THE RICKSHAW AND SHE THROWS HER HANDS UP AND SHE SAYS
HelenFisher_2006 WONDERFUL AND WASN 'T THAT RICKSHAW DRIVER HANDSOME
HelenFisher_2006 MAGIC TO LOVE BUT I WILL
HelenFisher_2006 MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO WE EVOLVED THREE BASIC DRIVES THE SEX DRIVE ROMANTIC LOVE AND ATTACHMENT TO A LONG TERM PARTNER
HelenFisher_2006 THESE CIRCUITS ARE DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN THE HUMAN BRAIN THEY'RE GOING TO SURVIVE AS LONG AS OUR SPECIES SURVIVES ON WHAT SHAKESPEARE CALLED THIS MORTAL COIL THANK YOU
