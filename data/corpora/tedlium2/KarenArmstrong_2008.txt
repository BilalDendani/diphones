KarenArmstrong_2008 WELL THIS IS SUCH
KarenArmstrong_2008 IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE IN THE PRESENCE OF AN ORGANIZATION
KarenArmstrong_2008 REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD AND I'M INTENSELY GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND I'M ALSO RATHER SURPRISED BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK BACK
KarenArmstrong_2008 ON MY LIFE THE LAST THING I EVER WANTED TO DO WAS WRITE OR BE IN ANY WAY INVOLVED IN RELIGION
KarenArmstrong_2008 AFTER I LEFT MY CONVENT I'D FINISHED WITH RELIGION FRANKLY I THOUGHT THAT WAS IT AND FOR THIRTEEN YEARS I KEPT CLEAR OF IT I WANTED TO BE AN ENGLISH LITERATURE PROFESSOR
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND I CERTAINLY DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO BE A WRITER PARTICULARLY BUT THEN I SUFFERED A SERIES OF CAREER CATASTROPHES ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND FINALLY FOUND MYSELF IN TELEVISION
KarenArmstrong_2008 I SAID THAT TO BILL MOYERS AND HE SAID OH WE TAKE ANYBODY
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND I WAS DOING SOME RATHER CONTROVERSIAL RELIGIOUS PROGRAMS THIS WENT DOWN VERY WELL IN THE U K
KarenArmstrong_2008 WHERE RELIGION IS EXTREMELY UNPOPULAR AND SO FOR ONCE FOR THE ONLY TIME IN MY LIFE I WAS FINALLY IN THE MAINSTREAM
KarenArmstrong_2008 BUT I GOT SENT TO JERUSALEM TO MAKE A FILM ABOUT EARLY CHRISTIANITY AND THERE FOR THE FIRST TIME I ENCOUNTERED THE OTHER RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS JUDAISM AND ISLAM
KarenArmstrong_2008 SISTER RELIGIONS OF CHRISTIANITY AND WHILE I FOUND I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THESE FAITHS AT ALL DESPITE MY OWN INTENSELY RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND
KarenArmstrong_2008 I'D SEEN JUDAISM ONLY AS A KIND OF PRELUDE TO CHRISTIANITY AND I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT ISLAM AT ALL
KarenArmstrong_2008 BUT IN THAT CITY THAT TORTURED CITY WHERE YOU SEE THE THREE FAITHS JOSTLING SO UNEASILY TOGETHER YOU ALSO BECOME AWARE
KarenArmstrong_2008 THE PROFOUND CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM AND IT HAS BEEN THE STUDY OF OTHER RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS THAT BROUGHT ME BACK TO A SENSE OF WHAT RELIGION CAN BE AND ACTUALLY ENABLED ME TO LOOK AT MY OWN FAITH IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND I FOUND SOME ASTONISHING THINGS IN THE COURSE OF MY STUDY THAT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO ME FRANKLY IN THE DAYS THAT WHEN I THOUGHT I'D HAD IT WITH RELIGION I JUST FOUND THE WHOLE THING ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE
KarenArmstrong_2008 THESE DOCTRINES SEEMED UNPROVEN ABSTRACT AND
KarenArmstrong_2008 TO MY ASTONISHMENT WHEN I BEGAN SERIOUSLY STUDYING OTHER TRADITIONS I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT
KarenArmstrong_2008 BELIEF WHICH WE MAKE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT TODAY IS ONLY A VERY RECENT RELIGIOUS
KarenArmstrong_2008 SURFACED ONLY IN THE WEST IN ABOUT THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THE WORD BELIEF ITSELF ORIGINALLY MEANT TO LOVE
KarenArmstrong_2008 TO PRIZE TO HOLD DEAR IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY IT NARROWED ITS FOCUS FOR REASONS THAT I'M EXPLORING IN A BOOK I'M WRITING AT THE MOMENT
KarenArmstrong_2008 TO INCLUDE TO MEAN AN INTELLECTUAL ASSENT TO A SET OF PROPOSITIONS
KarenArmstrong_2008 I BELIEVE IT DID NO MEAN I ACCEPT CERTAIN CREEDAL ARTICLES OF FAITH IT MEANT I COMMIT MYSELF I ENGAGE MYSELF
KarenArmstrong_2008 INDEED SOME OF THE WORLD TRADITIONS THINK VERY LITTLE OF RELIGIOUS ORTHODOXY IN THE
KarenArmstrong_2008 IF RELIGION IS NOT ABOUT BELIEVING THINGS WHAT IS IT ABOUT WHAT I'VE FOUND ACROSS THE BOARD IS THAT RELIGION IS ABOUT BEHAVING DIFFERENTLY
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND RELIGIOUS DOCTRINES ARE MEANT TO BE SUMMONS TO ACTION YOU ONLY UNDERSTAND THEM WHEN YOU PUT THEM INTO PRACTICE NOW
KarenArmstrong_2008 PRIDE OF PLACE
KarenArmstrong_2008 IN THIS PRACTICE IS GIVEN TO COMPASSION AND IT IS AN ARRESTING FACT THAT RIGHT ACROSS THE BOARD IN EVERY SINGLE ONE
KarenArmstrong_2008 OF THE MAJOR WORLD FAITHS COMPASSION THE ABILITY TO FEEL WITH THE OTHER IN THE WAY WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS EVENING
KarenArmstrong_2008 NOT ONLY THE TEST OF ANY TRUE RELIGIOSITY IT IS ALSO WHAT WILL BRING US INTO THE PRESENCE OF WHAT JEWS CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS CALL GOD OR THE DIVINE
KarenArmstrong_2008 IT IS COMPASSION SAYS THE BUDDHA WHICH BRINGS YOU TO NIRVANA
KarenArmstrong_2008 WHY BECAUSE IN COMPASSION WHEN WE FEEL WITH THE OTHER WE DETHRONE OURSELVES FROM THE CENTER OF OUR WORLD AND WE PUT ANOTHER PERSON THERE
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND ONCE WE GET RID OF EGO THEN WE'RE READY TO SEE THE DIVINE AND IN PARTICULAR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE MAJOR WORLD TRADITIONS
KarenArmstrong_2008 HAS HIGHLIGHTED HAS SAID AND PUT AT THE CORE OF THEIR TRADITION WHAT'S BECOME KNOWN AS THE GOLDEN RULE
KarenArmstrong_2008 FIRST PROPOUNDED BY CONFUCIUS FIVE CENTURIES BEFORE CHRIST DO NOT DO TO OTHERS WHAT YOU WOULD NOT LIKE THEM TO DO TO YOU THAT HE SAID WAS THE CENTRAL
KarenArmstrong_2008 THREAD WHICH RAN THROUGH ALL HIS TEACHING AND THAT HIS DISCIPLES SHOULD PUT INTO PRACTICE ALL DAY AND EVERY DAY AND IT WAS
KarenArmstrong_2008 THE GOLDEN RULE WOULD BRING THEM TO THE TRANSCENDENT VALUE THAT HE CALLED REN HUMAN HEARTEDNESS WHICH WAS A TRANSCENDENT EXPERIENCE IN ITSELF
KarenArmstrong_2008 THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL TO THE MONOTHEISMS TOO THERE'S A FAMOUS STORY ABOUT THE GREAT RABBI HILLEL THE OLDER CONTEMPORARY OF JESUS
KarenArmstrong_2008 A PAGAN CAME TO HIM AND OFFERED TO CONVERT TO JUDAISM IF THE RABBI COULD RECITE THE WHOLE OF JEWISH TEACHING WHILE HE STOOD ON ONE LEG
KarenArmstrong_2008 HILLEL STOOD ON ONE LEG AND SAID THAT WHICH IS HATEFUL TO YOU DO NOT DO TO YOUR NEIGHBOR THAT IS THE TORAH THE REST IS
KarenArmstrong_2008 IT WAS WHAT HE MEANT HE SAID IN YOUR EXEGESIS YOU MUST MAKE IT CLEAR THAT EVERY SINGLE VERSE OF THE TORAH
KarenArmstrong_2008 IS A COMMENTARY A GLOSS UPON THE GOLDEN RULE THE GREAT RABBI MEIR SAID THAT
KarenArmstrong_2008 SCRIPTURE HE SAYS TEACHES NOTHING BUT CHARITY AND WE MUST NOT LEAVE AN INTERPRETATION OF SCRIPTURE UNTIL WE HAVE FOUND A COMPASSIONATE INTERPRETATION OF IT
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND THIS STRUGGLE TO FIND COMPASSION IN SOME OF THESE RATHER REBARBATIVE TEXTS IS A GOOD DRESS REHEARSAL FOR DOING THE SAME IN ORDINARY LIFE
KarenArmstrong_2008 NOW LOOK AT OUR WORLD
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT IS WHERE RELIGION HAS BEEN HIJACKED
KarenArmstrong_2008 WHERE TERRORISTS CITE QUR 'ANIC VERSES TO JUSTIFY THEIR ATROCITIES
KarenArmstrong_2008 WHERE INSTEAD OF TAKING JESUS WORDS LOVE YOUR ENEMIES
KarenArmstrong_2008 DON'T JUDGE OTHERS WE HAVE THE SPECTACLE OF CHRISTIANS ENDLESSLY JUDGING OTHER PEOPLE
KarenArmstrong_2008 RELIGION HAS BEEN USED TO OPPRESS OTHERS AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF HUMAN EGO HUMAN GREED
KarenArmstrong_2008 WE HAVE A TALENT AS A SPECIES FOR MESSING UP WONDERFUL THINGS SO THE TRADITIONS ALSO INSISTED
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT I THINK THAT YOU COULD NOT AND MUST NOT CONFINE YOUR COMPASSION TO YOUR OWN GROUP
KarenArmstrong_2008 YOUR OWN NATION YOUR OWN CO RELIGIONISTS YOUR OWN FELLOW COUNTRYMEN YOU MUST HAVE WHAT ONE OF THE CHINESE SAGES CALLED JIAN AI CONCERN FOR EVERYBODY
KarenArmstrong_2008 WE FORMED YOU SAYS THE QUR 'AN INTO TRIBES AND NATIONS SO THAT YOU MAY KNOW ONE ANOTHER
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND THIS AGAIN THIS UNIVERSAL OUTREACH IS GETTING SUBDUED IN THE STRIDENT USE OF RELIGION ABUSE OF RELIGION FOR
KarenArmstrong_2008 DO FOR A LIVING INFORM ME THAT RELIGION HAS BEEN THE CAUSE OF ALL THE MAJOR WORLD WARS IN HISTORY WRONG
KarenArmstrong_2008 THE CAUSE OF OUR PRESENT WOES ARE POLITICAL
KarenArmstrong_2008 MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT RELIGION IS A KIND OF FAULT LINE
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND WHEN A CONFLICT GETS INGRAINED IN A REGION
KarenArmstrong_2008 RELIGION CAN GET SUCKED IN AND BECOME PART OF THE PROBLEM
KarenArmstrong_2008 SEVENTY MILLION PEOPLE DIED IN EUROPE ALONE AS A RESULT OF ARMED CONFLICT AND SO MANY OF
KarenArmstrong_2008 INSTITUTIONS EVEN FOOTBALL WHICH USED TO BE A PLEASANT PASTIME
KarenArmstrong_2008 CAUSES RIOTS WHERE PEOPLE EVEN DIE AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT RELIGION TOO HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS VIOLENT ETHOS
KarenArmstrong_2008 THERE'S ALSO A GREAT DEAL I THINK OF RELIGIOUS ILLITERACY AROUND PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK NOW EQUATE RELIGIOUS FAITH WITH BELIEVING THINGS
KarenArmstrong_2008 AS THOUGH THAT WE CALL RELIGIOUS PEOPLE OFTEN BELIEVERS AS THOUGH THAT WERE THE MAIN THING THAT THEY DO AND VERY OFTEN
KarenArmstrong_2008 SECONDARY GOALS GET PUSHED INTO THE FIRST PLACE IN PLACE OF COMPASSION AND THE GOLDEN RULE BECAUSE THE GOLDEN RULE IS DIFFICULT I SOMETIMES WHEN I'M SPEAKING TO
KarenArmstrong_2008 BECAUSE RELIGION A LOT OF RELIGIOUS PEOPLE PREFER TO BE RIGHT RATHER THAN
KarenArmstrong_2008 THAT'S NOT THE WHOLE STORY SINCE SEPTEMBER THE ELEVENTH WHEN MY WORK ON ISLAM SUDDENLY PROPELLED ME INTO PUBLIC LIFE IN A WAY THAT I'D NEVER IMAGINED
KarenArmstrong_2008 I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SORT OF GO ALL OVER THE WORLD AND FINDING EVERYWHERE I GO A YEARNING FOR CHANGE I'VE JUST COME BACK FROM PAKISTAN
KarenArmstrong_2008 WHERE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CAME TO MY LECTURES BECAUSE THEY WERE YEARNING FIRST OF ALL TO HEAR A FRIENDLY WESTERN VOICE
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE COMING
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND WERE ASKING ME THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE SAYING WHAT CAN WE DO WHAT CAN WE DO TO CHANGE THINGS
KarenArmstrong_2008 HOSTS IN PAKISTAN SAID LOOK DON'T BE TOO POLITE TO US TELL US WHERE WE'RE GOING WRONG LET 'S TALK TOGETHER
KarenArmstrong_2008 ABOUT WHERE RELIGION IS FAILING BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WITH OUR CURRENT SITUATION IS SO SERIOUS AT THE MOMENT
KarenArmstrong_2008 ANY IDEOLOGY THAT DOESN'T PROMOTE A SENSE OF GLOBAL UNDERSTANDING AND GLOBAL APPRECIATION
KarenArmstrong_2008 OF EACH OTHER IS FAILING THE TEST OF THE TIME AND RELIGION WITH ITS WIDE FOLLOWING
KarenArmstrong_2008 HERE IN THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE MAY BE BEING RELIGIOUS IN A DIFFERENT WAY AS A REPORT HAS JUST SHOWN BUT THEY STILL WANT TO BE RELIGIOUS
KarenArmstrong_2008 ONLY WESTERN EUROPE THAT HAS RETAINED ITS SECULARISM WHICH IS NOW BEGINNING TO LOOK RATHER ENDEARINGLY OLD FASHIONED
KarenArmstrong_2008 BUT PEOPLE WANT TO BE RELIGIOUS AND RELIGION SHOULD BE MADE TO BE A FORCE FOR HARMONY IN THE WORLD WHICH IT CAN AND SHOULD BE
KarenArmstrong_2008 BECAUSE OF THE GOLDEN RULE DO NOT DO TO OTHERS WHAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THEM DO TO YOU AN ETHOS THAT SHOULD NOW BE APPLIED GLOBALLY
KarenArmstrong_2008 WE SHOULD NOT TREAT OTHER NATIONS AS WE WOULD NOT WISH TO BE TREATED OURSELVES AND THESE WHATEVER OUR WRETCHED BELIEFS
KarenArmstrong_2008 IS A RELIGIOUS MATTER IT'S A SPIRITUAL MATTER IT'S A PROFOUND MORAL MATTER THAT ENGAGES AND SHOULD ENGAGE US ALL
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND AS I SAY THERE IS A HUNGER FOR CHANGE OUT THERE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES I THINK YOU SEE IT IN THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN
KarenArmstrong_2008 LONGING FOR CHANGE AND PEOPLE IN CHURCHES ALL OVER AND MOSQUES ALL OVER THIS CONTINENT
KarenArmstrong_2008 SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH COMING TOGETHER LOCALLY TO CREATE NETWORKS OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE MOSQUE WITH THE SYNAGOGUE
KarenArmstrong_2008 SAYING WE MUST START TO SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE MOVED BEYOND THE IDEA OF TOLERATION
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND MOVE TOWARD APPRECIATION
KarenArmstrong_2008 OF THE OTHER I'D THERE'S ONE STORY I'D JUST LIKE TO MENTION THIS COMES FROM THE ILIAD
KarenArmstrong_2008 IT TELLS YOU WHAT THIS SPIRITUALITY SHOULD BE YOU KNOW THE STORY OF THE ILIAD THE TEN YEAR WAR BETWEEN GREECE AND TROY IN ONE INCIDENT ACHILLES THE FAMOUS WARRIOR OF GREECE TAKES HIS TROOPS OUT OF THE WAR
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND THE WHOLE WAR EFFORT SUFFERS AND IN THE COURSE OF THE ENSUING MUDDLE HIS BELOVED FRIEND PATROCLUS IS KILLED AND KILLED IN SINGLE COMBAT BY ONE OF THE TROJAN PRINCES HECTOR
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND ACHILLES GOES MAD WITH GRIEF AND RAGE AND REVENGE AND HE MUTILATES THE BODY
KarenArmstrong_2008 HE KILLS
KarenArmstrong_2008 HECTOR HE MUTILATES HIS BODY AND THEN HE REFUSES TO GIVE THE BODY BACK FOR BURIAL TO THE FAMILY
KarenArmstrong_2008 WHICH MEANS THAT IN GREEK ETHOS HECTOR 'S SOUL WILL WANDER ETERNALLY LOST
KarenArmstrong_2008 THEN ONE NIGHT PRIAM KING OF TROY AN OLD MAN COMES INTO THE GREEK CAMP INCOGNITO MAKES HIS WAY TO ACHILLES TENT
KarenArmstrong_2008 TO ASK FOR THE BODY OF HIS SON
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND EVERYBODY IS SHOCKED WHEN THE OLD MAN TAKES OFF HIS HEAD COVERING AND SHOWS HIMSELF AND ACHILLES LOOKS AT HIM AND THINKS OF HIS FATHER AND HE STARTS TO WEEP
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND PRIAM LOOKS AT THE MAN WHO HAS MURDERED SO MANY OF HIS SONS
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND HE TOO STARTS TO WEEP
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND THE SOUND OF THEIR WEEPING FILLED THE HOUSE THE GREEKS BELIEVED THAT WEEPING TOGETHER CREATED A BOND BETWEEN PEOPLE
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND THEN ACHILLES TAKES THE BODY OF HECTOR HE HANDS IT VERY TENDERLY TO THE FATHER
KarenArmstrong_2008 THE TWO MEN LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND SEE EACH OTHER AS DIVINE
KarenArmstrong_2008 THAT IS THE ETHOS FOUND TOO IN ALL THE RELIGIONS IT'S WHAT IS MEANT BY OVERCOMING THE HORROR THAT WE FEEL WHEN WE
KarenArmstrong_2008 UNDER THREAT OF OUR ENEMIES AND BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE THE OTHER IT'S OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT THE WORD FOR HOLY IN HEBREW APPLIED TO GOD IS KADOSH
KarenArmstrong_2008 SEPARATE OTHER
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND IT IS OFTEN PERHAPS THE VERY OTHERNESS OF OUR ENEMIES WHICH CAN GIVE US INTIMATIONS OF THAT UTTERLY MYSTERIOUS TRANSCENDENCE WHICH IS GOD
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND NOW HERE 'S MY WISH
KarenArmstrong_2008 I WISH THAT YOU WOULD HELP WITH THE CREATION
KarenArmstrong_2008 LAUNCH AND PROPAGATION
KarenArmstrong_2008 OF A CHARTER FOR COMPASSION
KarenArmstrong_2008 CRAFTED BY A GROUP OF INSPIRATIONAL THINKERS FROM THE THREE ABRAHAMIC TRADITIONS OF JUDAISM CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM AND BASED ON THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THE GOLDEN RULE
KarenArmstrong_2008 WE NEED TO CREATE A MOVEMENT AMONG ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT I MEET IN MY TRAVELS YOU PROBABLY MEET TOO WHO WANT TO JOIN UP
KarenArmstrong_2008 IN SOME WAY AND RECLAIM THEIR FAITH WHICH THEY FEEL AS I SAY HAS BEEN HIJACKED WE NEED
KarenArmstrong_2008 TO EMPOWER PEOPLE TO REMEMBER THE COMPASSIONATE ETHOS AND TO GIVE GUIDELINES THIS CHARTER WOULD NOT BE A MASSIVE DOCUMENT I'D LIKE TO SEE IT
KarenArmstrong_2008 TO GIVE GUIDELINES AS TO HOW TO INTERPRET THE SCRIPTURES THESE TEXTS THAT ARE BEING ABUSED
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND THE IDEA TOO OF JEWS CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS THESE TRADITIONS NOW SO OFTEN AT LOGGERHEADS WORKING TOGETHER
KarenArmstrong_2008 TO CREATE A DOCUMENT WHICH WE HOPE WILL BE SIGNED BY A THOUSAND AT LEAST OF MAJOR RELIGIOUS LEADERS FROM ALL THE TRADITIONS OF THE WORLD
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND YOU ARE THE PEOPLE I'M JUST A SOLITARY SCHOLAR DESPITE THE IDEA THAT I LOVE A GOOD TIME WHICH I WAS RATHER AMAZED TO SEE COMING UP
KarenArmstrong_2008 I ACTUALLY SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ALONE STUDYING AND I'M NOT VERY YOU'RE THE PEOPLE WITH MEDIA KNOWLEDGE TO EXPLAIN TO ME HOW WE CAN GET THIS TO EVERYBODY EVERYBODY ON THE PLANET
KarenArmstrong_2008 THE IMAM IN NEW YORK CITY ALSO I WOULD BE WORKING WITH
KarenArmstrong_2008 THE ALLIANCE OF CIVILIZATIONS AT THE UNITED NATIONS I WAS PART OF THAT UNITED NATIONS
KarenArmstrong_2008 TO AVOID THE ESCALATION OF FURTHER EXTREMISM AND THE ALLIANCE HAS TOLD ME THAT THEY ARE VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH IT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS IS
KarenArmstrong_2008 THIS IS I CAN SEE SOME OF YOU STARTING TO LOOK WORRIED BECAUSE YOU THINK IT'S A SLOW AND CUMBERSOME BODY BUT WHAT THE UNITED NATIONS CAN DO IS GIVE US SOME NEUTRALITY
KarenArmstrong_2008 SO THAT THIS ISN'T SEEN AS A WESTERN OR A CHRISTIAN INITIATIVE BUT THAT IT'S COMING AS IT WERE FROM THE UNITED NATIONS FROM THE WORLD WHO WOULD HELP WITH THE SORT OF
KarenArmstrong_2008 BUREAUCRACY OF THIS AND SO I DO URGE YOU TO JOIN ME IN MAKING IN THIS CHARTER
KarenArmstrong_2008 TO BUILDING THIS CHARTER LAUNCHING IT AND PROPAGATING IT
KarenArmstrong_2008 SO THAT IT BECOMES I'D LIKE TO SEE IT IN EVERY COLLEGE EVERY CHURCH EVERY MOSQUE EVERY SYNAGOGUE IN THE WORLD
KarenArmstrong_2008 SO THAT PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT THEIR TRADITION RECLAIM IT
KarenArmstrong_2008 AND MAKE RELIGION A SOURCE OF PEACE IN THE WORLD WHICH IT CAN AND SHOULD BE
KarenArmstrong_2008 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
