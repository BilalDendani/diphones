KiranBedi_2010W A PRODUCT OF THIS VISIONARY MOTHER AND FATHER
KiranBedi_2010W MANY YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS BORN IN THE
KiranBedi_2010W THEY BELONGED BOYS WHO WOULD JOIN BUSINESS AND INHERIT BUSINESS FROM PARENTS AND GIRLS WOULD BE DOLLED UP TO GET
KiranBedi_2010W MY FAMILY IN MY CITY AND ALMOST IN THE COUNTRY WAS UNIQUE WE WERE FOUR OF US NOT ONE
KiranBedi_2010W MY FATHER DEFIED HIS OWN GRANDFATHER ALMOST TO THE POINT OF DISINHERITANCE BECAUSE HE DECIDED TO EDUCATE
KiranBedi_2010W HE SENT US TO ONE OF THE BEST SCHOOLS IN THE CITY AND GAVE US THE BEST EDUCATION AS I'VE SAID WHEN WE'RE BORN WE DON'T CHOOSE OUR PARENTS AND WHEN WE GO TO SCHOOL WE DON'T CHOOSE OUR SCHOOL
KiranBedi_2010W AND MY FATHER USED TO SAY AT THAT TIME I 'M GOING TO SPREAD ALL MY FOUR DAUGHTERS IN FOUR CORNERS OF THE WORLD I DON'T KNOW IF HE REALLY MEANT
KiranBedi_2010W SINCE I SAID THEY'RE MY ROLE MODELS I FOLLOWED TWO THINGS WHICH MY FATHER AND MOTHER GAVE ME ONE THEY SAID LIFE IS ON AN INCLINE YOU EITHER GO UP
KiranBedi_2010W OUT OF ONE HUNDRED NINETY ARE YOUR CREATION THEY'RE GOOD THEY'RE YOUR CREATION ENJOY IT IF THEY'RE BAD THEY'RE YOUR CREATION LEARN FROM IT
KiranBedi_2010W NATURE SENT OVER WHICH YOU CAN'T DO A THING IT'S LIKE A DEATH OF A RELATIVE OR A CYCLONE OR A HURRICANE OR AN EARTHQUAKE YOU CAN'T DO A THING ABOUT IT YOU'VE GOT TO JUST RESPOND TO THE SITUATION
KiranBedi_2010W COMES OUT OF THOSE NINETY POINTS SINCE I'M A PRODUCT OF THIS PHILOSOPHY OF NINETY TEN AND SECONDLY LIFE ON AN INCLINE
KiranBedi_2010W THE WAY I GREW UP TO BE VALUING WHAT I GOT I'M A PRODUCT OF OPPORTUNITIES RARE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FIFTIES AND THE
KiranBedi_2010W WHICH GIRLS DIDN'T GET AND I WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT WHAT MY PARENTS WERE GIVING ME WAS SOMETHING UNIQUE BECAUSE ALL OF MY BEST SCHOOL FRIENDS WERE GETTING DOLLED UP TO GET MARRIED WITH A LOT OF DOWRY
KiranBedi_2010W AND HERE I WAS WITH A TENNIS RACKET AND GOING TO SCHOOL AND DOING ALL KINDS OF EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES I THOUGHT I MUST TELL YOU THIS WHY I SAID THIS IS THE BACKGROUND THIS IS WHAT COMES NEXT
KiranBedi_2010W I JOINED THE INDIAN POLICE SERVICE AS A TOUGH WOMAN A WOMAN WITH INDEFATIGABLE STAMINA BECAUSE I USED TO RUN FOR MY
KiranBedi_2010W I DECIDED NO IT'S A POWER TO PREVENT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I LEARNED WHEN I WAS GROWING UP HOW DO I PREVENT THE TEN AND NEVER MAKE IT MORE THAN TEN
KiranBedi_2010W SO THIS WAS HOW IT CAME INTO MY SERVICE AND IT WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE MEN I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE IT DIFFERENT FROM THE MEN BUT IT WAS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THIS WAS THE WAY I WAS DIFFERENT AND I REDEFINED POLICING CONCEPTS IN INDIA
KiranBedi_2010W TAKE YOU ON TWO JOURNEYS MY POLICING JOURNEY AND MY PRISON JOURNEY WHAT YOU SEE IF YOU SEE THE TITLE
KiranBedi_2010W WAS GIVEN A PARKING TICKET
KiranBedi_2010W NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN IN INDIA BECAUSE NOW IT WAS ONCE AND FOREVER
KiranBedi_2010W AND THE RULE WAS BECAUSE I WAS SENSITIVE I WAS COMPASSIONATE I WAS VERY SENSITIVE TO INJUSTICE AND I WAS VERY PRO JUSTICE THAT'S THE REASON AS A WOMAN I JOINED THE
KiranBedi_2010W I HAD OTHER OPTIONS BUT I DIDN'T CHOOSE THEM SO I'M GOING TO MOVE ON THIS IS ABOUT TOUGH POLICING EQUAL POLICING
KiranBedi_2010W TEN THOUSAND MEN OF WHICH ONLY FOUR HUNDRED WERE WOMEN TEN THOUSAND NINE THOUSAND PLUS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED WERE MEN TERRORISTS

KiranBedi_2010W STARTED TO CHANGE THIS IS A VISUAL OF EDUCATION INSIDE THE PRISON FRIENDS THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED WHERE EVERYBODY IN THE PRISON STUDIES
KiranBedi_2010W I STARTED THIS WITH COMMUNITY SUPPORT GOVERNMENT HAD NO BUDGET IT WAS ONE OF THE FINEST LARGEST VOLUNTEERISM IN ANY PRISON IN THE WORLD THIS WAS INITIATED IN DELHI PRISON YOU SEE ONE SAMPLE
KiranBedi_2010W PRISONER TEACHING A CLASS THESE ARE HUNDREDS OF CLASSES NINE TO ELEVEN EVERY PRISONER WENT INTO THE EDUCATION
KiranBedi_2010W SAME DEN IN WHICH THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD PUT ME BEHIND THE BAR AND THINGS WOULD BE FORGOTTEN WE CONVERTED THIS INTO A ASHRAM FROM A PRISON TO AN ASHRAM THROUGH EDUCATION
KiranBedi_2010W I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGER CHANGE IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A CHANGE TEACHERS WERE PRISONERS TEACHERS WERE VOLUNTEERS BOOKS CAME FROM DONATED SCHOOL BOOKS STATIONARY WAS DONATED EVERYTHING WAS DONATED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO BUDGET FOR EDUCATION FOR THE PRISON
KiranBedi_2010W NOW IF I'D NOT DONE THAT

KiranBedi_2010W TOOK THE SAME CONCEPT OF MINDFULNESS BECAUSE WHY DID I BRING MEDITATION INTO THE INDIAN PRISON BECAUSE CRIME IS A PRODUCT OF A DISTORTED MIND
KiranBedi_2010W I TOOK THE SAME THING TO THE POLICE BECAUSE THE POLICE EQUALLY WERE PRISONERS OF THEIR MINDS AND THEY FELT AS IF IT WAS WE AND THEY AND THAT THE PEOPLE DON'T COOPERATE
