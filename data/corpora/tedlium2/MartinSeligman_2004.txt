MartinSeligman_2004 AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION THEY TRIED TO MEDIA TRAIN ME
MartinSeligman_2004 SO THEY CAME TO ME CNN AND THEY SAID PROFESSOR SELIGMAN
MartinSeligman_2004 WOULD YOU TELL US ABOUT THE STATE OF PSYCHOLOGY TODAY WE 'D LIKE TO INTERVIEW YOU ABOUT THAT
MartinSeligman_2004 DOCTOR SELIGMAN WHAT IS THE STATE OF PSYCHOLOGY TODAY
MartinSeligman_2004 NOT GOOD
MartinSeligman_2004 SO WHY WAS PSYCHOLOGY GOOD
MartinSeligman_2004 WELL FOR MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS PSYCHOLOGY WORKED WITHIN THE DISEASE MODEL TEN YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS ON AN AIRPLANE AND I INTRODUCED MYSELF TO MY SEATMATE AND TOLD THEM WHAT I DID THEY 'D MOVE AWAY FROM
MartinSeligman_2004 AND BECAUSE QUITE RIGHTLY THEY WERE SAYING PSYCHOLOGY IS ABOUT FINDING WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOU SPOT THE LOONY AND NOW WHEN I TELL PEOPLE WHAT I DO
MartinSeligman_2004 THEY MOVE TOWARD ME AND WHAT WAS GOOD
MartinSeligman_2004 AND NOW FOURTEEN OF THE DISORDERS ARE TREATABLE TWO OF THEM ACTUALLY CURABLE AND THE OTHER
MartinSeligman_2004 THING THAT HAPPENED IS THAT A SCIENCE DEVELOPED A SCIENCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS THAT WE FOUND OUT THAT WE COULD TAKE FUZZY CONCEPTS LIKE
MartinSeligman_2004 DEPRESSION ALCOHOLISM AND MEASURE THEM WITH RIGOR THAT WE COULD CREATE A CLASSIFICATION OF THE MENTAL ILLNESSES THAT WE COULD
MartinSeligman_2004 UNDERSTAND THE CAUSALITY OF THE MENTAL ILLNESSES WE COULD LOOK ACROSS TIME AT THE SAME PEOPLE PEOPLE
MartinSeligman_2004 FOR EXAMPLE WHO WERE GENETICALLY VULNERABLE TO SCHIZOPHRENIA AND ASK WHAT THE CONTRIBUTION OF MOTHERING OF GENETICS ARE AND WE COULD ISOLATE THIRD VARIABLES BY DOING EXPERIMENTS ON THE MENTAL ILLNESSES
MartinSeligman_2004 AND BEST OF ALL WE WERE ABLE IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS TO INVENT DRUG TREATMENTS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENTS AND THEN WE WERE ABLE TO TEST THEM RIGOROUSLY IN RANDOM ASSIGNMENT PLACEBO CONTROLLED DESIGNS THROW OUT THE THINGS THAT DIDN 'T WORK KEEP THE THINGS THAT ACTIVELY DID
MartinSeligman_2004 AND THE CONCLUSION OF THAT IS THAT PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY OVER THE LAST SIXTY YEARS CAN ACTUALLY CLAIM THAT WE CAN MAKE MISERABLE PEOPLE LESS MISERABLE
MartinSeligman_2004 AND I THINK THAT 'S TERRIFIC I 'M PROUD OF
MartinSeligman_2004 THE SECOND COST WAS THAT WE FORGOT ABOUT YOU PEOPLE WE FORGOT ABOUT IMPROVING NORMAL LIVES WE FORGOT ABOUT A MISSION TO MAKE RELATIVELY UNTROUBLED PEOPLE HAPPIER MORE FULFILLED MORE PRODUCTIVE
MartinSeligman_2004 AND GENIUS HIGH TALENT BECAME A DIRTY WORD NO ONE WORKS ON THAT
MartinSeligman_2004 AND THE THIRD PROBLEM ABOUT THE DISEASE MODEL IS IN OUR RUSH TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT PEOPLE IN TROUBLE
MartinSeligman_2004 IN OUR RUSH TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT REPAIRING DAMAGE
MartinSeligman_2004 POSITIVE INTERVENTIONS SO THAT WAS NOT GOOD AND SO THAT 'S WHAT LED PEOPLE LIKE NANCY ETCOFF DAN GILBERT MIKE CSIKSZENTMIHALYI AND MYSELF TO WORK IN SOMETHING I CALL POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY WHICH HAS THREE AIMS THE FIRST IS THAT PSYCHOLOGY
MartinSeligman_2004 SHOULD BE JUST AS CONCERNED WITH HUMAN STRENGTH AS IT IS WITH WEAKNESS
MartinSeligman_2004 IT SHOULD BE JUST AS CONCERNED WITH BUILDING STRENGTH AS WITH REPAIRING DAMAGE IT SHOULD BE INTERESTED IN THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE AND IT SHOULD BE JUST AS CONCERNED WITH MAKING THE LIVES OF NORMAL PEOPLE FULFILLING AND
MartinSeligman_2004 WITH GENIUS WITH NURTURING HIGH TALENT
MartinSeligman_2004 SO IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AND THE HOPE FOR THE FUTURE WE 'VE SEEN THE BEGINNINGS OF A SCIENCE OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY A SCIENCE OF WHAT MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING IT TURNS OUT THAT WE CAN MEASURE
MartinSeligman_2004 DIFFERENT FORMS OF HAPPINESS AND ANY OF YOU FOR FREE
MartinSeligman_2004 WE CREATED THE OPPOSITE OF THE DIAGNOSTIC MANUAL OF THE INSANITIES
MartinSeligman_2004 WE FOUND THAT WE COULD DISCOVER THE CAUSATION OF THE POSITIVE STATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
MartinSeligman_2004 SIX YEARS AGO WE ASKED ABOUT EXTREMELY HAPPY PEOPLE AND HOW DO THEY DIFFER FROM THE REST OF US
MartinSeligman_2004 AND IT TURNS OUT THERE 'S ONE WAY THEY 'RE NOT MORE RELIGIOUS THEY 'RE NOT IN BETTER SHAPE THEY DON 'T HAVE MORE MONEY THEY 'RE NOT BETTER LOOKING THEY DON 'T HAVE MORE GOOD EVENTS AND FEWER BAD EVENTS THE ONE WAY IN WHICH THEY DIFFER THEY 'RE EXTREMELY SOCIAL
MartinSeligman_2004 THEY DON 'T SPEND TIME ALONE EACH OF THEM IS IN A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP AND EACH HAS A RICH REPERTOIRE OF FRIENDS BUT WATCH OUT HERE THIS IS MERELY CORRELATIONAL DATA NOT CAUSAL
MartinSeligman_2004 AND IT 'S ABOUT HAPPINESS IN THE FIRST HOLLYWOOD SENSE I 'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HAPPINESS OF EBULLIENCE AND GIGGLING AND GOOD CHEER
MartinSeligman_2004 AND I 'M GOING TO SUGGEST TO YOU THAT 'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH IN JUST A MOMENT
MartinSeligman_2004 WE FOUND WE COULD BEGIN TO LOOK AT INTERVENTIONS OVER THE CENTURIES FROM THE BUDDHA TO TONY ROBBINS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY INTERVENTIONS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED THAT ALLEGEDLY MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY
MartinSeligman_2004 AND WE FIND THAT WE 'VE BEEN ABLE TO MANUALIZE MANY OF THEM AND WE ACTUALLY CARRY OUT RANDOM ASSIGNMENT
MartinSeligman_2004 AND TO ASK THAT QUESTION HAPPY IS NOT A WORD I USE VERY MUCH WE 'VE HAD TO BREAK IT DOWN INTO WHAT I THINK IS ASKABLE ABOUT HAPPY AND I BELIEVE THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT
MartinSeligman_2004 IS THE PLEASANT LIFE THIS IS A LIFE IN WHICH YOU HAVE AS MUCH POSITIVE EMOTION AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN AND THE SKILLS TO AMPLIFY IT THE SECOND IS A LIFE OF ENGAGEMENT A LIFE IN YOUR WORK YOUR PARENTING YOUR LOVE YOUR LEISURE TIME STOPS FOR YOU
MartinSeligman_2004 IT 'S HAVING AS MANY OF THE PLEASURES AS YOU CAN AS MUCH POSITIVE EMOTION AS YOU CAN
MartinSeligman_2004 LEARNING THE SKILLS SAVORING MINDFULNESS THAT AMPLIFY THEM THAT STRETCH THEM OVER TIME AND SPACE BUT THE
MartinSeligman_2004 HERITABLE ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT HERITABLE
MartinSeligman_2004 AND IN FACT
MartinSeligman_2004 NOT VERY MODIFIABLE SO THE DIFFERENT TRICKS THAT MATTHIEU RICARD AND I AND OTHERS KNOW ABOUT INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF POSITIVE EMOTION IN YOUR LIFE ARE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PERCENT
MartinSeligman_2004 AND AS I SAID IT 'S NOT PARTICULARLY MALLEABLE
MartinSeligman_2004 WHY POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY IS MORE THAN POSITIVE EMOTION MORE THAN BUILDING PLEASURE IN TWO OF THE THREE GREAT ARENAS OF LIFE BY THE TIME LEN WAS THIRTY LEN WAS ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL
MartinSeligman_2004 THE FIRST ARENA
MartinSeligman_2004 WAS WORK BY THE TIME HE WAS TWENTY
MartinSeligman_2004 BUT IN THE THIRD GREAT ARENA OF LIFE LOVE LEN IS AN ABYSMAL FAILURE
MartinSeligman_2004 AND THE REASON HE WAS WAS THAT LEN IS A COLD
MartinSeligman_2004 BUT IT TURNED OUT THERE WASN 'T ANY SEXUAL TRAUMA IT TURNED OUT THAT LEN GREW UP IN LONG ISLAND AND HE PLAYED FOOTBALL AND WATCHED FOOTBALL AND PLAYED BRIDGE
MartinSeligman_2004 AND I WANT TO SAY NOT CONTRARY TO WHAT PSYCHOLOGY TOLD US ABOUT
MartinSeligman_2004 THE BOTTOM FIFTY PERCENT OF THE HUMAN RACE IN POSITIVE AFFECTIVITY I THINK LEN IS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE I KNOW HE 'S NOT CONSIGNED TO THE HELL OF UNHAPPINESS AND THAT 'S BECAUSE LEN LIKE MOST OF YOU IS ENORMOUSLY CAPABLE OF FLOW WHEN HE WALKS ONTO THE FLOOR OF THE AMERICAN EXCHANGE
MartinSeligman_2004 AT NINE THIRTY IN THE MORNING
MartinSeligman_2004 TIME STOPS FOR HIM AND IT STOPS TILL THE CLOSING BELL WHEN THE FIRST CARD IS PLAYED UNTIL TEN DAYS LATER THE TOURNAMENT IS OVER TIME STOPS FOR
MartinSeligman_2004 IT 'S THOUGHT AND FEELING BUT WHAT MIKE TOLD YOU YESTERDAY DURING FLOW
MartinSeligman_2004 YOU CAN 'T FEEL ANYTHING
MartinSeligman_2004 TIME STOPS YOU HAVE INTENSE CONCENTRATION AND THIS IS INDEED THE CHARACTERISTIC OF WHAT WE THINK OF AS THE GOOD LIFE
MartinSeligman_2004 HER HIGHEST STRENGTH WAS SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE SO SHE RE CRAFTED BAGGING TO MAKE THE ENCOUNTER WITH HER THE SOCIAL HIGHLIGHT OF EVERY CUSTOMER 'S DAY NOW OBVIOUSLY SHE FAILED BUT WHAT SHE DID WAS TO TAKE HER HIGHEST STRENGTHS AND RE CRAFT WORK TO USE THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
MartinSeligman_2004 WHAT YOU GET OUT OF THAT IS NOT SMILEY NESS YOU DON 'T LOOK LIKE DEBBIE REYNOLDS YOU DON 'T GIGGLE A LOT WHAT YOU GET IS MORE
MartinSeligman_2004 TO BELONG TO AND IN THE SERVICE OF SOMETHING LARGER THAN YOU ARE
MartinSeligman_2004 THE PLEASANT LIFE THE GOOD LIFE THE MEANINGFUL LIFE PEOPLE ARE NOW HARD AT WORK ON THE QUESTION ARE THERE THINGS THAT LASTINGLY CHANGE THOSE LIVES
MartinSeligman_2004 AND THE ANSWER SEEMS
MartinSeligman_2004 TO BE YES AND I 'LL JUST GIVE YOU SOME SAMPLES OF IT IT 'S BEING DONE IN A RIGOROUS MANNER IT 'S BEING DONE IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE TEST DRUGS TO SEE WHAT REALLY WORKS SO WE DO
MartinSeligman_2004 RANDOM ASSIGNMENT PLACEBO CONTROLLED LONG TERM STUDIES OF DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS AND JUST TO SAMPLE THE KIND OF INTERVENTIONS THAT WE FIND HAVE AN EFFECT
MartinSeligman_2004 WHEN WE TEACH PEOPLE ABOUT THE PLEASANT LIFE HOW TO HAVE MORE PLEASURE IN YOUR LIFE ONE OF YOUR ASSIGNMENTS IS TO TAKE THE MINDFULNESS SKILLS THE SAVORING SKILLS AND YOU 'RE ASSIGNED TO DESIGN A BEAUTIFUL
MartinSeligman_2004 I 'D LIKE YOU
MartinSeligman_2004 WHO DID SOMETHING ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT THAT CHANGED YOUR LIFE
MartinSeligman_2004 YOUR ASSIGNMENT WHEN YOU 'RE LEARNING THE GRATITUDE VISIT IS TO WRITE A THREE HUNDRED WORD TESTIMONIAL TO THAT PERSON
MartinSeligman_2004 AND WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN WE TEST PEOPLE
MartinSeligman_2004 ONE WEEK LATER A MONTH LATER THREE MONTHS LATER THEY 'RE BOTH HAPPIER AND LESS DEPRESSED
MartinSeligman_2004 THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THE PURSUIT OF PLEASURE THE PURSUIT OF POSITIVE EMOTION
MartinSeligman_2004 THE PLEASANT LIFE THE PURSUIT OF ENGAGEMENT TIME STOPPING FOR YOU AND THE PURSUIT OF MEANING CONTRIBUTE TO LIFE SATISFACTION
MartinSeligman_2004 AND OUR RESULTS SURPRISED US BUT THEY WERE BACKWARD OF WHAT WE THOUGHT IT TURNS OUT THE PURSUIT OF PLEASURE HAS ALMOST NO CONTRIBUTION TO LIFE SATISFACTION
MartinSeligman_2004 FULL LIFE THE SUM IS GREATER THAN THE PARTS IF YOU 'VE GOT ALL THREE CONVERSELY IF YOU HAVE NONE OF THE THREE THE EMPTY LIFE THE SUM IS LESS THAN THE PARTS AND WHAT WE 'RE ASKING NOW IS DOES THE VERY SAME RELATIONSHIP
MartinSeligman_2004 PRODUCTIVITY A FUNCTION OF POSITIVE EMOTION ENGAGEMENT AND MEANING IS HEALTH A FUNCTION OF POSITIVE ENGAGEMENT OF PLEASURE AND OF MEANING IN LIFE AND THERE IS REASON TO THINK THE ANSWER TO BOTH OF THOSE MAY WELL BE YES
MartinSeligman_2004 SO CHRIS SAID THAT THE
MartinSeligman_2004 BUT I FOUND THAT THE PROBLEMS OF PSYCHOLOGY SEEMED TO BE PARALLEL TO THE PROBLEMS OF TECHNOLOGY ENTERTAINMENT AND DESIGN IN THE FOLLOWING WAY WE ALL KNOW THAT TECHNOLOGY ENTERTAINMENT AND DESIGN HAVE BEEN AND CAN BE USED FOR DESTRUCTIVE PURPOSES
MartinSeligman_2004 WE ALSO KNOW THAT TECHNOLOGY ENTERTAINMENT AND DESIGN CAN BE USED TO RELIEVE MISERY
MartinSeligman_2004 AND BY THE WAY THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN RELIEVING MISERY AND BUILDING HAPPINESS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I THOUGHT WHEN I FIRST BECAME A THERAPIST THIRTY YEARS AGO THAT IF I WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE SOMEONE NOT DEPRESSED NOT ANXIOUS NOT ANGRY
MartinSeligman_2004 THAT I 'D MAKE THEM HAPPY
MartinSeligman_2004 AND I NEVER FOUND THAT I FOUND THE BEST YOU COULD EVER DO WAS TO GET TO ZERO
MartinSeligman_2004 BUT THEY WERE EMPTY AND IT TURNS OUT THE SKILLS OF HAPPINESS THE SKILLS OF THE PLEASANT LIFE THE SKILLS OF ENGAGEMENT THE SKILLS OF MEANING ARE
MartinSeligman_2004 DIFFERENT FROM THE SKILLS OF RELIEVING MISERY
MartinSeligman_2004 AND SO THE PARALLEL THING HOLDS WITH TECHNOLOGY ENTERTAINMENT AND DESIGN I BELIEVE THAT IS IT IS POSSIBLE
MartinSeligman_2004 FOR THESE THREE DRIVERS OF OUR WORLD TO INCREASE HAPPINESS
MartinSeligman_2004 TO INCREASE POSITIVE EMOTION AND THAT 'S TYPICALLY HOW THEY 'VE BEEN USED BUT ONCE YOU FRACTIONATE HAPPINESS THE WAY I DO NOT JUST POSITIVE EMOTION THAT 'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH THERE 'S FLOW IN LIFE AND THERE 'S MEANING IN LIFE
MartinSeligman_2004 AS LAURA LEE TOLD US DESIGN AND I BELIEVE ENTERTAINMENT AND TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED TO INCREASE MEANING ENGAGEMENT IN LIFE AS WELL SO IN CONCLUSION THE ELEVENTH REASON FOR OPTIMISM IN ADDITION TO
MartinSeligman_2004 WITH TECHNOLOGY ENTERTAINMENT AND DESIGN WE CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF TONNAGE OF HUMAN HAPPINESS ON THE PLANET
MartinSeligman_2004 AND IF TECHNOLOGY CAN IN THE NEXT DECADE OR TWO INCREASE THE PLEASANT LIFE THE GOOD LIFE AND THE MEANINGFUL LIFE IT WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH IF ENTERTAINMENT CAN BE DIVERTED TO ALSO INCREASE POSITIVE EMOTION MEANING
MartinSeligman_2004 CAN INCREASE POSITIVE EMOTION
