DaleDougherty_2011S@26.32:44.71 WE 'RE BORN MAKERS WE HAVE THIS ABILITY TO MAKE THINGS TO GRASP THINGS WITH OUR HANDS WE USE WORDS LIKE GRASP METAPHORICALLY TO ALSO THINK ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THINGS WE DON 'T JUST LIVE BUT WE MAKE WE CREATE THINGS
DaleDougherty_2011S@44.71:61.98 WELL I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A GROUP OF MAKERS FROM MAKER FAIRE AND VARIOUS PLACES IT DOESN 'T COME OUT PARTICULARLY WELL BUT THAT 'S A PARTICULARLY TALL BICYCLE IT 'S A SCRAPER BIKE IT 'S CALLED FROM OAKLAND AND THIS IS A PARTICULARLY SMALL SCOOTER FOR A GENTLEMAN OF THIS SIZE
DaleDougherty_2011S@69.19:85.42 AND THE QUESTION HE HAD IS CAN I DO IT CAN IT BE DONE APPARENTLY IT CAN SO MAKERS ARE ENTHUSIASTS THEY 'RE AMATEURS THEY 'RE PEOPLE WHO LOVE DOING WHAT THEY DO THEY DON 'T ALWAYS EVEN KNOW WHY THEY 'RE DOING IT
DaleDougherty_2011S@85.42:98.11 WE HAVE BEGUN ORGANIZING MAKERS AT OUR MAKER FAIRE THERE WAS ONE HELD IN DETROIT HERE LAST SUMMER AND IT WILL BE HELD AGAIN NEXT SUMMER AT THE HENRY FORD BUT WE HOLD THEM IN SAN FRANCISCO
DaleDougherty_2011S@130.97:148.49 AND YOU CAN BARELY SEE IT BUT IT 'S A CONTROLLER AT TOP CYCLES THE WATER TO FALL JUST BEFORE AND AFTER YOU PASS THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF THE ARC SO IMAGINE A KID AM I GOING TO GET WET AM I GOING TO GET WET NO I DIDN 'T GET WET AM I GOING TO GET WET AM I GOING TO GET WET THAT 'S THE EXPERIENCE OF A CLEVER RIDE
DaleDougherty_2011S@148.49:155.86 AND OF COURSE WE HAVE FASHION PEOPLE ARE REMAKING THINGS INTO FASHION I DON 'T KNOW IF THIS IS CALLED A BASKET BRA BUT IT OUGHT TO BE
DaleDougherty_2011S@174.23:183.3 IS THE GUY WHO DID THIS IS A PHYSICIST AND HERE HE 'LL EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT IT DOES VIDEO RICHARD CARTER I 'M RICHARD CARTER AND THIS IS THE SASHIMI TABERNACLE
DaleDougherty_2011S@215.75:227.8 SO ARE YOU A MAKER HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE WOULD SAY YOU 'RE A MAKER IF YOU RAISE YOUR HAND THAT 'S A PRETTY GOOD BUT THERE 'S SOME OF YOU OUT THERE THAT WON 'T ADMIT THAT YOU 'RE MAKERS AND AGAIN THINK ABOUT IT YOU 'RE MAKERS OF FOOD
DaleDougherty_2011S@227.8:240.82 YOU 'RE MAKERS OF SHELTER YOU 'RE MAKERS OF LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND PARTLY WHAT INTERESTS ME TODAY IS YOU 'RE MAKERS OF YOUR OWN WORLD AND PARTICULARLY THE ROLE THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS IN YOUR LIFE
DaleDougherty_2011S@240.83:248.35 YOU 'RE REALLY A DRIVER OR A PASSENGER TO USE A VOLKSWAGEN PHRASE MAKERS ARE IN CONTROL THAT 'S WHAT
DaleDougherty_2011S@248.36:258.24 THEM THAT 'S WHY THEY DO WHAT THEY DO THEY WANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW THINGS WORK THEY WANT TO GET ACCESS TO IT AND THEY WANT TO CONTROL IT THEY WANT TO USE IT TO THEIR OWN PURPOSE
DaleDougherty_2011S@269.22:276.94 IT WAS FAIRLY COMMONPLACE TO THINK OF YOURSELF AS A MAKER IT WAS NOT SOMETHING YOU 'D EVEN REMARK UPON AND I FOUND THIS OLD
DaleDougherty_2011S@304.46:313.13 OF ALL THINGS AMERICANS ARE WE ARE MAKERS WITH OUR STRENGTHS AND OUR MINDS AND SPIRIT
DaleDougherty_2011S@313.13:320.47 WE GATHER WE FORM AND WE FASHION MAKERS AND SHAPERS AND PUT IT TOGETHERERS
DaleDougherty_2011S@340.36:350.22 IT DIDN 'T JUST EXIST WE MADE IT AND WE WERE CONNECTED TO IT THAT WAY AND I THINK THAT 'S TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT NOW I 'M GOING TO TELL YOU ONE FUNNY THING ABOUT THIS
DaleDougherty_2011S@350.22:356.73 THIS PARTICULAR REEL IT 'S AN INDUSTRIAL VIDEO BUT IT WAS SHOWN IN DRIVE IN THEATERS
DaleDougherty_2011S@361.08:366.65 FACT AND IT PRECEDED ALFRED HITCHCOCK 'S PSYCHO
DaleDougherty_2011S@373.29:390.71 THIS IS ANDREW ARCHER I MET ANDREW AT ONE OF OUR COMMUNITY MEETINGS PUTTING TOGETHER MAKER FAIRE ANDREW HAD MOVED TO DETROIT FROM DULUTH MINNESOTA AND I TALKED TO HIS MOM AND I ENDED UP DOING A STORY ON HIM FOR A MAGAZINE CALLED KIDROBOT HE 'S JUST A KID
DaleDougherty_2011S@393.35:402.43 PLAYING WITH TOOLS INSTEAD OF TOYS HE LIKED TO TAKE THINGS APART HIS MOTHER GAVE HIM A PART OF THE GARAGE AND HE COLLECTED THINGS FROM YARD SALES AND HE MADE STUFF
DaleDougherty_2011S@402.43:412.72 AND THEN HE DIDN 'T PARTICULARLY LIKE SCHOOL THAT MUCH BUT HE GOT INVOLVED IN ROBOTICS COMPETITIONS AND HE REALIZED HE HAD A TALENT AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HE HAD A REAL PASSION FOR IT
DaleDougherty_2011S@412.72:427.98 AND HE BEGAN BUILDING ROBOTS AND WHEN I SAT DOWN NEXT TO HIM HE WAS TELLING ME ABOUT A COMPANY HE FORMED AND HE WAS BUILDING SOME ROBOTS FOR AUTOMOBILE FACTORIES TO MOVE THINGS AROUND ON THE FACTORY FLOOR AND THAT 'S WHY HE MOVED TO MICHIGAN BUT HE ALSO
DaleDougherty_2011S@427.98:444.49 MOVED HERE TO MEET OTHER PEOPLE DOING WHAT HE 'S DOING AND THIS KIND OF GETS TO THIS IMPORTANT IDEA TODAY THIS IS JEFF AND BILAL AND SEVERAL OTHERS HERE IN A HACKERSPACE AND THERE 'S ABOUT THREE HACKERSPACES OR MORE IN DETROIT AND THERE 'S PROBABLY EVEN SOME NEW ONES SINCE I 'VE BEEN HERE LAST
DaleDougherty_2011S@444.49:451.7 BUT THESE ARE LIKE CLUBS THEY 'RE SHARING TOOLS SHARING SPACE SHARING EXPERTISE IN WHAT TO MAKE
DaleDougherty_2011S@451.7:459.8 AND SO IT 'S A VERY INTERESTING PHENOMENON THAT 'S GOING ACROSS THE WORLD BUT ESSENTIALLY THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE PLAYING WITH TECHNOLOGY
DaleDougherty_2011S@469.12:474.61 AND PROBABLY TO DISCOVER WHAT THEY CAN DO THEMSELVES WHAT THEIR OWN CAPABILITIES ARE
DaleDougherty_2011S@513.58:526.19 NOW THAT COULD BE A DOG DOOR IT COULD BE SOMEONE GOING SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY SHOULDN 'T LIKE A LITTLE BROTHER INTO A LITTLE SISTER 'S ROOM THERE 'S ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE FOR THAT
DaleDougherty_2011S@533.44:550.93 AND THERE ARE INDUSTRIAL VERSIONS OF THIS ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THESE GUYS CAME UP WITH A KIT VERSION FOR SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS AND THAT MEANS THAT HOBBYISTS AND ORDINARY FOLKS CAN GET A HOLD OF THIS AND BEGIN PLAYING WITH THREE D PRINTERS NOW THEY DON 'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH IT BUT THEY 'RE GOING TO FIGURE IT OUT
DaleDougherty_2011S@567.41:583.72 SO MAKERS HARVEST TECHNOLOGY FROM ALL THE PLACES AROUND US THIS IS A RADAR SPEED DETECTOR THAT WAS DEVELOPED FROM A HOT WHEELS TOY AND THEY DO INTERESTING THINGS THEY 'RE REALLY CREATING NEW AREAS AND EXPLORING AREAS THAT YOU MIGHT ONLY THINK
DaleDougherty_2011S@603.24:608.56 THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND TO LOVE SPACE
DaleDougherty_2011S@608.56:619.15 YOU COULD BUILD YOUR OWN SATELLITE AND GET IT INTO SPACE FOR LIKE EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS THINK HOW MUCH MONEY AND HOW MANY YEARS IT TOOK NASA TO GET SATELLITES INTO SPACE
DaleDougherty_2011S@619.15:630.79 IN FACT THESE GUYS ACTUALLY WORK FOR NASA AND THEY 'RE TRYING TO PIONEER USING OFF THE SHELF COMPONENTS CHEAP THINGS THAT AREN 'T SPECIALIZED THAT THEY CAN COMBINE AND SEND UP INTO SPACE
DaleDougherty_2011S@630.79:642.06 MAKERS ARE A SOURCE OF INNOVATION AND I THINK IT RELATES BACK TO SOMETHING LIKE THE BIRTH OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY THIS IS STEVE WOZNIAK WHERE DOES HE LEARN ABOUT COMPUTERS IT 'S THE HOMEBREW COMPUTER CLUB JUST LIKE
DaleDougherty_2011S@651.3:662.63 BUT IT 'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT A LOT OF THE ORIGINS OF OUR INDUSTRIES EVEN LIKE HENRY FORD COME FROM THIS IDEA OF PLAYING AND FIGURING THINGS OUT IN GROUPS
DaleDougherty_2011S@662.63:670.16 WELL IF I HAVEN 'T CONVINCED YOU THAT YOU 'RE A MAKER I HOPE I COULD CONVINCE YOU THAT OUR NEXT GENERATION SHOULD BE MAKERS THAT KIDS
DaleDougherty_2011S@670.16:672.68 ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THIS
