AlbertoCairo_2011X MY JOB IS TO MAKE ARMS AND LEGS WELL IT 'S NOT COMPLETELY TRUE WE DO MORE THAN THAT
AlbertoCairo_2011X WE PROVIDE THE PATIENTS THE AFGHAN DISABLED FIRST WITH THE PHYSICAL REHABILITATION THEN WITH THE SOCIAL REINTEGRATION IT 'S A VERY LOGICAL PLAN
AlbertoCairo_2011X QUITE MANY YEARS FOR THE PROGRAM TO BECOME WHAT IT IS NOW TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU A STORY THE STORY OF A BIG CHANGE AND THE STORY OF THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS CHANGE POSSIBLE
AlbertoCairo_2011X AND THEN NOT ONLY FOR WAR VICTIMS BUT IT WAS FOR ANY KIND OF PATIENT I WAS ALSO WORKING IN THE ORTHOPEDIC CENTER WE CALL IT THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE WE MAKE THE LEGS AT THAT TIME
AlbertoCairo_2011X I FOUND MYSELF IN A STRANGE SITUATION I FELT NOT QUITE READY FOR THAT JOB THERE WAS SO MUCH TO LEARN
AlbertoCairo_2011X THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS NEW TO ME BUT IT WAS A TERRIFIC JOB BUT AS SOON AS THE FIGHTING INTENSIFIED THE PHYSICAL REHABILITATION WAS SUSPENDED THERE WERE MANY OTHER THINGS TO DO
AlbertoCairo_2011X SO THE ORTHOPEDIC CENTER WAS CLOSED BECAUSE PHYSICAL REHABILITATION WAS NOT CONSIDERED A PRIORITY
AlbertoCairo_2011X IT WAS A STRANGE SENSATION
AlbertoCairo_2011X AND THE ORTHOPEDIC CENTER WAS CLOSED I WAS ASSIGNED TO WORK FOR THE HOMELESS FOR THE INTERNALLY
AlbertoCairo_2011X I WANTED TO GO HOME I WAS DRIVING YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WANT TO FORGET YOU DON 'T WANT TO SEE THINGS SO YOU JUST WANT TO GO TO YOUR ROOM TO LOCK YOURSELF INSIDE AND SAY THAT 'S ENOUGH
AlbertoCairo_2011X A BOMB FELL NOT FAR FROM MY CAR
AlbertoCairo_2011X EVERYBODY DISAPPEARED FROM THE STREET THE CARS DISAPPEARED AS WELL I DUCKED AND ONLY ONE FIGURE REMAINED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD IT WAS A MAN IN A WHEELCHAIR
AlbertoCairo_2011X THE MAN WAS WITHOUT LEGS AND ONLY WITH ONE ARM
AlbertoCairo_2011X SO I TOOK HIM INTO A SAFE PLACE AND I ASK WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT IN THE STREET IN THIS SITUATION I WORK HE SAID I WONDERED WHAT WORK
AlbertoCairo_2011X AND THEN I ASK AN EVEN MORE STUPID QUESTION WHY DON 'T YOU HAVE THE PROSTHESES WHY DON 'T YOU HAVE THE ARTIFICIAL LEGS
AlbertoCairo_2011X THE CENTER IS CLOSED NO STAFF AROUND MAYBE THE MACHINERY IS BROKEN WHO IS GOING TO MAKE THE LEGS FOR HIM SO I HOPED THAT HE WOULD NOT COME THIS IS THE STREETS OF KABUL
AlbertoCairo_2011X I WAS READY TO TELL HIM LISTEN IF SOMEONE SUCH AND SUCH COMES TOMORROW PLEASE TELL HIM THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE NOTHING CAN BE DONE
AlbertoCairo_2011X GIVE HIM SOME MONEY BUT MAHMOUD AND HIS SON WERE ALREADY THERE AND THEY WERE NOT ALONE THERE WERE FIFTEEN MAYBE TWENTY PEOPLE LIKE HIM WAITING AND THERE WAS SOME STAFF TOO
AlbertoCairo_2011X AMONG THEM THERE WAS MY RIGHT HAND MAN NAJMUDDIN AND THE GATEKEEPER TOLD ME THEY COME EVERYDAY TO SEE IF THE CENTER WILL OPEN
AlbertoCairo_2011X BUT NAJMUDDIN TOLD ME LISTEN NOW WE 'RE HERE AT LEAST WE CAN START REPAIRING THE PROSTHESES THE BROKEN PROSTHESES OF THE PEOPLE AND MAYBE TRY TO DO SOMETHING FOR
AlbertoCairo_2011X PEOPLE LIKE MAHMOUD I SAID NO PLEASE WE CANNOT DO THAT IT 'S REALLY DANGEROUS WE HAVE OTHER THINGS TO DO BUT THEY INSISTED WHEN YOU HAVE TWENTY PEOPLE IN FRONT OF YOU LOOKING AT YOU AND YOU ARE THE ONE WHO HAS TO DECIDE
AlbertoCairo_2011X SO WE STARTED DOING SOME REPAIRS ALSO ONE OF THE PHYSICAL THERAPISTS REPORTED THAT MAHMOUD COULD BE PROVIDED WITH A LEG BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY THE LEGS WERE SWOLLEN AND THE KNEES WERE STIFF SO HE NEEDED A LONG PREPARATION
AlbertoCairo_2011X I TOLD THEM LISTEN WE ARE GOING TO START A COUPLE OF HOURS PER DAY JUST A FEW REPAIRS MAYBE SOME OF THEM ARE HERE NOW
AlbertoCairo_2011X SO WE STARTED I WAS WORKING I WAS GOING EVERYDAY TO WORK FOR THE HOMELESS
AlbertoCairo_2011X A COUPLE OF TIMES I CROSSED THE FRONT LINE IN THE VERY PLACE WHERE MAHMOUD AND HIS SON WERE CROSSING I TELL YOU IT WAS SOMETHING SO SINISTER
AlbertoCairo_2011X I WAS ASTONISHED HE COULD DO IT EVERY DAY
AlbertoCairo_2011X WE COULD NOT POSSIBLY STAY INDOORS WITH ALL THESE SANDBAGS AT THE WINDOWS VERY SAD DARK SO WE CHOSE A SMALL SPOT IN THE GARDEN
AlbertoCairo_2011X THEY STARTED FIGHTING TWO GROUPS OF MUJAHIDEEN STARTED FIGHTING WE COULD HEAR IN THE AIR THE BULLETS PASSING SO WE DASHED ALL OF US TOWARDS THE SHELTER
AlbertoCairo_2011X BUT WE MANAGED TO REACH THE SHELTER INSIDE ALL OF US PANTING I SAT A MOMENT AND I HEARD RAFI TELLING HIS FATHER FATHER YOU CAN RUN FASTER THAN ME
AlbertoCairo_2011X I CAN RUN AND NOW YOU CAN GO TO SCHOOL NO NEED OF STAYING WITH ME ALL THE DAY PUSHING MY WHEELCHAIR
AlbertoCairo_2011X LATER ON WE TOOK THEM HOME
AlbertoCairo_2011X AND I WILL NEVER FORGET MAHMOUD AND HIS SON WALKING TOGETHER PUSHING THE EMPTY WHEELCHAIR AND THEN I UNDERSTOOD PHYSICAL REHABILITATION IS A PRIORITY DIGNITY CANNOT WAIT FOR BETTER TIMES
AlbertoCairo_2011X I MET MAHMOUD ONE YEAR LATER HE WAS IN GOOD SHAPE A BIT THINNER
AlbertoCairo_2011X THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW HELP ME NOT TO BE A BEGGAR ANYMORE THAT WAS THE JOB
AlbertoCairo_2011X MY CHILDREN ARE GROWING I FEEL ASHAMED I DON 'T WANT THEM TO BE
AlbertoCairo_2011X TEASED AT SCHOOL BY THE OTHER STUDENTS
AlbertoCairo_2011X HE READ MY MIND
AlbertoCairo_2011X AND HE SAID I ASK FOR A JOB AND THEN HE ADDED SOMETHING I WILL NEVER FORGET FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE HE SAID I AM A SCRAP OF A MAN
AlbertoCairo_2011X BUT IF YOU HELP ME I 'M READY TO DO ANYTHING EVEN IF I HAVE TO CRAWL ON THE GROUND
AlbertoCairo_2011X AND THEN HE SAT DOWN I SAT DOWN TOO WITH GOOSEBUMPS EVERYWHERE
AlbertoCairo_2011X LEGLESS WITH ONLY ONE ARM ILLITERATE
AlbertoCairo_2011X UNSKILLED WHAT JOB FOR HIM
AlbertoCairo_2011X GLUE AND TO SCREW THE SOLE OF THE FEET WE NEED TO INCREASE THE PRODUCTION
AlbertoCairo_2011X EXCUSE ME I COULD NOT BELIEVE
AlbertoCairo_2011X AND THEN HE SAID NO WE CAN MODIFY THE WORKBENCH MAYBE TO PUT A SPECIAL STOOL A SPECIAL ANVIL SPECIAL VICE AND MAYBE AN ELECTRIC SCREWDRIVER
AlbertoCairo_2011X IT 'S CRUEL TO OFFER HIM A JOB KNOWING THAT HE 'S GOING TO FAIL BUT WITH NAJMUDDIN WE CANNOT
AlbertoCairo_2011X DISCUSS SO
AlbertoCairo_2011X THE ONLY THINGS I COULD MANAGE TO OBTAIN WAS A KIND OF A
AlbertoCairo_2011X I TOLD NAJMUDDIN THAT 'S A TRICK I CAN 'T BELIEVE IT THE PRODUCTION WAS UP TWENTY PERCENT IT 'S A TRICK IT 'S A TRICK I SAID
AlbertoCairo_2011X AND THEN I ASKED FOR VERIFICATION IT WAS TRUE THE COMMENT OF NAJMUDDIN WAS MAHMOUD HAS SOMETHING TO PROVE I UNDERSTOOD THAT I WAS WRONG AGAIN MAHMOUD HAD LOOKED TALLER I REMEMBER HIM SITTING BEHIND THE WORKBENCH
AlbertoCairo_2011X OF COURSE I UNDERSTOOD THAT WHAT MADE HIM STAND TALL YEAH THEY WERE THE LEGS THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT AS A FIRST STEP IT WAS THE DIGNITY HE HAS REGAINED HIS FULL DIGNITY THANKS TO THAT JOB
AlbertoCairo_2011X AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT 'S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY EVERYBODY BENEFITS FROM THAT
AlbertoCairo_2011X THOSE EMPLOYED OF COURSE BECAUSE THEY GET A JOB
AlbertoCairo_2011X AND DIGNITY BUT ALSO FOR THE NEWCOMERS THEY ARE SEVEN THOUSAND EVERY YEAR PEOPLE COMING FOR THE FIRST TIME AND YOU SHOULD SEE THE FACES OF THESE PEOPLE WHEN THEY REALIZE THAT THOSE ASSISTING THEM ARE LIKE THEM SOMETIMES YOU SEE THEM THEY LOOK
AlbertoCairo_2011X AND YOU SEE THE FACES AND THEN THE SURPRISE TURNS INTO HOPE AND IT 'S EASY FOR ME AS WELL TO TRAIN SOMEONE
AlbertoCairo_2011X AND WHEN YOU START CHANGING YOU CANNOT STOP SO
AlbertoCairo_2011X IT IS POSSIBLE AND IT IS NOT DIFFICULT ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TO LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED ASSIST TO MAKE THEM PART
AlbertoCairo_2011X WELL NOW YOU SHOULD SEE ME I NEVER MISS A SINGLE TRAINING SESSION THE NIGHT BEFORE A MATCH I 'M VERY NERVOUS AND YOU SHOULD SEE ME DURING THE MATCH I SHOUT LIKE A TRUE ITALIAN
