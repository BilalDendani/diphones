AlbertoCairo_2011X@23.85:31.75 MY JOB IS TO MAKE ARMS AND LEGS WELL IT 'S NOT COMPLETELY TRUE WE DO MORE THAN THAT
AlbertoCairo_2011X@31.75:44.12 WE PROVIDE THE PATIENTS THE AFGHAN DISABLED FIRST WITH THE PHYSICAL REHABILITATION THEN WITH THE SOCIAL REINTEGRATION IT 'S A VERY LOGICAL PLAN
AlbertoCairo_2011X@52.85:69.21 QUITE MANY YEARS FOR THE PROGRAM TO BECOME WHAT IT IS NOW TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU A STORY THE STORY OF A BIG CHANGE AND THE STORY OF THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS CHANGE POSSIBLE
AlbertoCairo_2011X@79.22:93.27 AND THEN NOT ONLY FOR WAR VICTIMS BUT IT WAS FOR ANY KIND OF PATIENT I WAS ALSO WORKING IN THE ORTHOPEDIC CENTER WE CALL IT THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE WE MAKE THE LEGS AT THAT TIME
AlbertoCairo_2011X@93.3:104.17 I FOUND MYSELF IN A STRANGE SITUATION I FELT NOT QUITE READY FOR THAT JOB THERE WAS SO MUCH TO LEARN
AlbertoCairo_2011X@104.17:115.58 THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS NEW TO ME BUT IT WAS A TERRIFIC JOB BUT AS SOON AS THE FIGHTING INTENSIFIED THE PHYSICAL REHABILITATION WAS SUSPENDED THERE WERE MANY OTHER THINGS TO DO
AlbertoCairo_2011X@116.01:123.65 SO THE ORTHOPEDIC CENTER WAS CLOSED BECAUSE PHYSICAL REHABILITATION WAS NOT CONSIDERED A PRIORITY
AlbertoCairo_2011X@128.06:131.79 IT WAS A STRANGE SENSATION
AlbertoCairo_2011X@150.47:158.78 AND THE ORTHOPEDIC CENTER WAS CLOSED I WAS ASSIGNED TO WORK FOR THE HOMELESS FOR THE INTERNALLY
AlbertoCairo_2011X@178.06:191.93 I WANTED TO GO HOME I WAS DRIVING YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WANT TO FORGET YOU DON 'T WANT TO SEE THINGS SO YOU JUST WANT TO GO TO YOUR ROOM TO LOCK YOURSELF INSIDE AND SAY THAT 'S ENOUGH
AlbertoCairo_2011X@191.93:195.66 A BOMB FELL NOT FAR FROM MY CAR
AlbertoCairo_2011X@200.37:213.92 EVERYBODY DISAPPEARED FROM THE STREET THE CARS DISAPPEARED AS WELL I DUCKED AND ONLY ONE FIGURE REMAINED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD IT WAS A MAN IN A WHEELCHAIR

AlbertoCairo_2011X@246.05:259.75 SO I TOOK HIM INTO A SAFE PLACE AND I ASK WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT IN THE STREET IN THIS SITUATION I WORK HE SAID I WONDERED WHAT WORK
AlbertoCairo_2011X@259.75:268.15 AND THEN I ASK AN EVEN MORE STUPID QUESTION WHY DON 'T YOU HAVE THE PROSTHESES WHY DON 'T YOU HAVE THE ARTIFICIAL LEGS
AlbertoCairo_2011X@291.76:308.81 THE CENTER IS CLOSED NO STAFF AROUND MAYBE THE MACHINERY IS BROKEN WHO IS GOING TO MAKE THE LEGS FOR HIM SO I HOPED THAT HE WOULD NOT COME THIS IS THE STREETS OF KABUL
AlbertoCairo_2011X@323.69:333.04 I WAS READY TO TELL HIM LISTEN IF SOMEONE SUCH AND SUCH COMES TOMORROW PLEASE TELL HIM THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE NOTHING CAN BE DONE
AlbertoCairo_2011X@333.45:347.72 GIVE HIM SOME MONEY BUT MAHMOUD AND HIS SON WERE ALREADY THERE AND THEY WERE NOT ALONE THERE WERE FIFTEEN MAYBE TWENTY PEOPLE LIKE HIM WAITING AND THERE WAS SOME STAFF TOO
