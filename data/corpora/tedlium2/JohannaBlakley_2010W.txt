JohannaBlakley_2010W TODAY THAT MAY SEEM A LITTLE BIT CRAZY SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE END OF GENDER
JohannaBlakley_2010W LET ME CONNECT THE DOTS
JohannaBlakley_2010W ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP FREE US FROM SOME OF THE ABSURD ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE HAVE AS A SOCIETY ABOUT GENDER I THINK THAT SOCIAL MEDIA IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP US DISMANTLE
JohannaBlakley_2010W SOME OF THE SILLY AND DEMEANING STEREOTYPES THAT WE SEE IN MEDIA AND ADVERTISING ABOUT GENDER
JohannaBlakley_2010W IF YOU HADN'T NOTICED OUR MEDIA CLIMATE GENERALLY PROVIDES A VERY DISTORTED MIRROR OF OUR LIVES AND OF OUR GENDER AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE
JohannaBlakley_2010W NOW MOST MEDIA COMPANIES TELEVISION RADIO PUBLISHING GAMES YOU NAME IT
JohannaBlakley_2010W THEY USE VERY RIGID SEGMENTATION METHODS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THEIR AUDIENCES IT'S OLD SCHOOL DEMOGRAPHICS THEY COME UP WITH THESE VERY RESTRICTIVE LABELS TO DEFINE US
JohannaBlakley_2010W NOW THE CRAZY THING IS THAT MEDIA COMPANIES BELIEVE THAT IF YOU FALL WITHIN A CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC CATEGORY THEN YOU ARE PREDICTABLE IN CERTAIN WAYS
JohannaBlakley_2010W YOU HAVE CERTAIN TASTE THAT YOU LIKE CERTAIN THINGS AND SO THE BIZARRE RESULT OF THIS IS THAT MOST OF OUR POPULAR CULTURE IS ACTUALLY BASED ON THESE PRESUMPTIONS ABOUT OUR DEMOGRAPHICS
JohannaBlakley_2010W AGE DEMOGRAPHICS THE EIGHTEEN TO FORTY NINE DEMO
JohannaBlakley_2010W HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON ALL MASS MEDIA PROGRAMMING IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WHEN THE BABY BOOMERS WERE STILL YOUNG
JohannaBlakley_2010W NOW THEY'VE AGED OUT OF THAT DEMOGRAPHIC BUT IT'S STILL THE CASE THAT POWERFUL RATINGS COMPANIES LIKE NIELSON DON'T EVEN TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
JohannaBlakley_2010W VIEWERS OF TELEVISION SHOWS OVER AGE FIFTY FOUR IN OUR MEDIA ENVIRONMENT IT'S AS IF THEY DON'T EVEN
JohannaBlakley_2010W NOW IF YOU WATCH MAD MEN LIKE I DO IT'S A POPULAR TV SHOW IN THE STATES DOCTOR FAYE MILLER DOES SOMETHING CALLED PSYCHOGRAPHICS WHICH
JohannaBlakley_2010W FIRST CAME ABOUT IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WHERE YOU CREATE THESE COMPLEX PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES OF CONSUMERS BUT PSYCHOGRAPHICS REALLY HAVEN'T HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON THE MEDIA BUSINESS IT'S REALLY JUST BEEN BASIC DEMOGRAPHICS
JohannaBlakley_2010W SO I'M AT THE NORMAN LEAR CENTER AT USC AND WE'VE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH OVER THE LAST SEVEN EIGHT YEARS ON DEMOGRAPHICS AND HOW THEY AFFECT MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT IN THIS COUNTRY
JohannaBlakley_2010W AND ABROAD AND IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE BEEN LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT SOCIAL MEDIA TO SEE WHAT HAS CHANGED AND WE'VE DISCOVERED SOME VERY INTERESTING THINGS
JohannaBlakley_2010W ALL THE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE IN SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS BELONG TO THE SAME OLD DEMOGRAPHIC CATEGORIES THAT MEDIA COMPANIES AND ADVERTISERS HAVE USED IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND
JohannaBlakley_2010W ABLE TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE QUITE FREELY AND TO REDEFINE OURSELVES ONLINE AND WE CAN LIE ABOUT OUR AGE ONLINE TOO PRETTY EASILY
JohannaBlakley_2010W WE CAN ALSO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE BASED ON OUR VERY SPECIFIC INTERESTS WE DON'T NEED A MEDIA COMPANY TO HELP DO THIS FOR US
JohannaBlakley_2010W THE TRADITIONAL MEDIA COMPANIES OF COURSE ARE PAYING VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THESE ONLINE COMMUNITIES THEY KNOW THIS IS THE MASS AUDIENCE OF THE FUTURE
JohannaBlakley_2010W THEY NEED TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME DOING IT BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO USE DEMOGRAPHICS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THEM BECAUSE THAT'S HOW AD RATES ARE STILL DETERMINED
JohannaBlakley_2010W THEY HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME FIGURING OUT YOUR AGE YOUR GENDER AND YOUR INCOME THEY CAN MAKE SOME EDUCATED GUESSES
JohannaBlakley_2010W BUT THEY GET A LOT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT YOU DO ONLINE WHAT YOU LIKE WHAT INTERESTS YOU THAT'S EASIER FOR THEM TO FIND OUT THAN WHO YOU ARE AND EVEN THOUGH THAT'S STILL CREEPY
JohannaBlakley_2010W THERE IS AN UPSIDE TO HAVING YOUR TASTE MONITORED SUDDENLY OUR TASTE IS BEING RESPECTED IN A WAY THAT IT HASN'T BEEN BEFORE IT HAD BEEN PRESUMED BEFORE
JohannaBlakley_2010W SO WHEN YOU LOOK ONLINE AT THE WAY PEOPLE AGGREGATE THEY DON'T AGGREGATE AROUND AGE GENDER AND INCOME
JohannaBlakley_2010W THEY AGGREGATE AROUND THE THINGS THEY LOVE THE THINGS THAT THEY LIKE AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT SHARED INTERESTS AND VALUES ARE A FAR MORE POWERFUL AGGREGATOR OF HUMAN BEINGS THAN DEMOGRAPHIC CATEGORIES
JohannaBlakley_2010W I'D MUCH RATHER KNOW WHETHER YOU LIKE BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER RATHER THAN HOW OLD YOU ARE THAT WOULD TELL ME SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL ABOUT YOU
JohannaBlakley_2010W IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS THESE ARE WORLDWIDE STATISTICS IN EVERY SINGLE AGE CATEGORY WOMEN ACTUALLY OUTNUMBER MEN IN THEIR USE OF SOCIAL NETWORKING TECHNOLOGIES
JohannaBlakley_2010W AND THEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THEY SPEND ON THESE SITES
JohannaBlakley_2010W THEY TRULY DOMINATE THE SOCIAL MEDIA SPACE WHICH IS A SPACE THAT'S HAVING A HUGE IMPACT ON OLD MEDIA
JohannaBlakley_2010W THE QUESTION IS WHAT SORT OF IMPACT IS THIS GOING TO HAVE ON OUR CULTURE AND WHAT'S IT GOING TO MEAN FOR WOMEN
JohannaBlakley_2010W IF THE CASE IS THAT SOCIAL MEDIA IS DOMINATING OLD MEDIA AND WOMEN ARE DOMINATING SOCIAL MEDIA THEN DOES THAT MEAN THAT WOMEN ARE GOING TO TAKE OVER GLOBAL MEDIA
JohannaBlakley_2010W ARE WE SUDDENLY GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE FEMALE CHARACTERS IN CARTOONS AND IN GAMES AND ON TV SHOWS WILL THE NEXT BIG BUDGET BLOCKBUSTER MOVIES ACTUALLY BE CHICK FLICKS
JohannaBlakley_2010W COULD THIS BE POSSIBLE THAT SUDDENLY OUR MEDIA LANDSCAPE WILL BECOME A FEMINIST LANDSCAPE
JohannaBlakley_2010W WELL I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CASE I THINK THAT MEDIA COMPANIES ARE GOING TO HIRE A LOT MORE WOMEN BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR THEIR BUSINESS AND I THINK THAT WOMEN ARE ALSO
JohannaBlakley_2010W CONTINUE TO DOMINATE THE SOCIAL MEDIA SPHERE BUT I THINK WOMEN ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE IRONICALLY ENOUGH RESPONSIBLE FOR DRIVING A STAKE THROUGH THE HEART
JohannaBlakley_2010W OF CHEESY GENRE CATEGORIES LIKE THE CHICK FLICK AND ALL THESE OTHER GENRE CATEGORIES THAT PRESUME
JohannaBlakley_2010W THAT CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS LIKE CERTAIN THINGS THAT HISPANICS LIKE CERTAIN THINGS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE CERTAIN THINGS THIS IS FAR TOO SIMPLISTIC
JohannaBlakley_2010W THE FUTURE ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IS GOING TO BE VERY DATA DRIVEN AND IT'S GOING TO BE BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT WE ASCERTAIN FROM TASTE COMMUNITIES ONLINE WHERE WOMEN ARE REALLY DRIVING THE ACTION
JohannaBlakley_2010W SO YOU MAY BE ASKING WELL WHY IS IT IMPORTANT THAT I KNOW WHAT ENTERTAINS PEOPLE WHY SHOULD I KNOW THIS OF COURSE OLD MEDIA COMPANIES AND ADVERTISERS NEED TO KNOW THIS
JohannaBlakley_2010W BUT MY ARGUMENT IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE GLOBAL VILLAGE IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA THAT YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT AMUSES THEM WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO DO IN THEIR FREE TIME
JohannaBlakley_2010W THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW ABOUT PEOPLE I'VE SPENT MOST OF MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE RESEARCHING MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT AND ITS IMPACT ON PEOPLE 'S LIVES AND I DO IT NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S FUN
JohannaBlakley_2010W BUT ALSO BECAUSE OUR RESEARCH HAS SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT ENTERTAINMENT AND PLAY HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON PEOPLE 'S LIVES
JohannaBlakley_2010W A MEDIA ATMOSPHERE THAT ISN'T DOMINATED BY LAME STEREOTYPES ABOUT GENDER AND OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS CAN YOU EVEN IMAGINE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE
JohannaBlakley_2010W I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE THANK YOU SO MUCH
