JanChipchase_2007 I LIVE AND WORK FROM TOKYO JAPAN AND I SPECIALIZE IN HUMAN BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH
JanChipchase_2007 AND APPLYING WHAT WE LEARN TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND TO DESIGN FOR THAT FUTURE
JanChipchase_2007 AND YOU KNOW TO BE HONEST I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR SEVEN YEARS AND I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE WHAT THE FUTURE IS GOING TO BE LIKE
JanChipchase_2007 THIS IS MY OFFICE
JanChipchase_2007 IT'S OUT THERE IT'S NOT IN THE LAB
JanChipchase_2007 AND IT'S INCREASINGLY IN PLACES LIKE INDIA CHINA BRAZIL AFRICA
JanChipchase_2007 TAKE ABOUT ANOTHER TWO YEARS TO CONNECT THE NEXT BILLION
JanChipchase_2007 AND I MENTION THIS BECAUSE IF WE WANT TO DESIGN FOR THAT FUTURE WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE ABOUT AND THAT 'S KIND OF WHERE I SEE WHAT MY JOB IS
JanChipchase_2007 IF YOU THINK OF EVERYTHING IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU
JanChipchase_2007 WHEN YOU WALK OUT THAT DOOR WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER TO TAKE WITH YOU
JanChipchase_2007 OF THAT STUFF WHAT DO YOU CARRY
JanChipchase_2007 OF THAT STUFF WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY USE
JanChipchase_2007 SO THIS IS INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THE CONSCIOUS AND SUBCONSCIOUS
JanChipchase_2007 DECISION PROCESS IMPLIES THAT THE STUFF THAT YOU DO TAKE WITH YOU AND END UP USING HAS SOME KIND OF SPIRITUAL EMOTIONAL OR FUNCTIONAL VALUE AND TO PUT IT REALLY BLUNTLY YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR STUFF THAT HAS VALUE RIGHT
JanChipchase_2007 SO I'VE PROBABLY DONE ABOUT FIVE YEARS RESEARCH LOOKING AT WHAT PEOPLE CARRY I GO IN PEOPLE 'S BAGS I LOOK IN PEOPLE 'S POCKETS PURSES I GO IN THEIR HOMES AND WE DO THIS WORLDWIDE
JanChipchase_2007 WE FOLLOW THEM AROUND TOWN WITH VIDEO CAMERAS IT'S KIND OF LIKE STALKING WITH PERMISSION
JanChipchase_2007 WE DO ALL THIS
JanChipchase_2007 AND TO GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION WHAT DO PEOPLE CARRY
JanChipchase_2007 AND IT TURNS OUT THAT PEOPLE CARRY A LOT OF STUFF OK THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH BUT IF YOU ASK PEOPLE WHAT THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT THEY CARRY
JanChipchase_2007 ACROSS CULTURES AND ACROSS GENDER AND ACROSS CONTEXTS MOST PEOPLE WILL SAY KEYS MONEY AND IF THEY OWN ONE A MOBILE PHONE
JanChipchase_2007 IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE AN OBVIOUS THING FOR SOMEONE WHO WORKS FOR A MOBILE PHONE COMPANY TO ASK BUT REALLY THE QUESTION IS WHY
JanChipchase_2007 SO WHY ARE THESE THINGS SO IMPORTANT IN OUR LIVES AND IT TURNS OUT
JanChipchase_2007 FROM OUR RESEARCH THAT IT BOILS DOWN TO SURVIVAL SURVIVAL FOR US AND SURVIVAL FOR OUR LOVED ONES SO
JanChipchase_2007 KEYS PROVIDE AN ACCESS TO SHELTER AND WARMTH TRANSPORT AS WELL IN THE U S INCREASINGLY MONEY IS USEFUL FOR BUYING FOOD
JanChipchase_2007 SUSTENANCE AMONG ALL ITS OTHER USES AND A MOBILE PHONE IT TURNS OUT IS A GREAT RECOVERY TOOL
JanChipchase_2007 IF YOU PREFER THIS KIND OF MASLOW 'S HIERARCHY OF NEEDS THOSE THREE OBJECTS ARE VERY GOOD AT SUPPORTING THE LOWEST RUNGS IN MASLOW 'S HIERARCHY OF NEEDS
JanChipchase_2007 YES THEY DO A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER STUFF
JanChipchase_2007 AND IN PARTICULAR IT'S THE MOBILE PHONE 'S ABILITY
JanChipchase_2007 TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO TRANSCEND SPACE AND TIME AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRANSCEND SPACE BY SIMPLY MAKING A VOICE CALL RIGHT
JanChipchase_2007 AND THIS IS FAIRLY UNIVERSALLY APPRECIATED IT TURNS OUT WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE THREE BILLION PLUS PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONNECTED AND THEY VALUE THAT CONNECTIVITY
JanChipchase_2007 BUT ACTUALLY YOU CAN DO THIS KIND OF STUFF WITH PCS AND YOU CAN DO THEM WITH PHONE KIOSKS
JanChipchase_2007 AND THE MOBILE PHONE IN ADDITION
JanChipchase_2007 IS BOTH PERSONAL AND SO IT ALSO GIVES YOU A DEGREE OF PRIVACY AND IT'S CONVENIENT
JanChipchase_2007 HOWEVER FOR THESE THINGS TO HELP US SURVIVE
JanChipchase_2007 IT DEPENDS ON THEM BEING CARRIED
JanChipchase_2007 WE FORGET WE'RE HUMAN THAT'S WHAT WE DO IT'S ONE OF OUR FEATURES I THINK QUITE A NICE FEATURE
JanChipchase_2007 THE NEXT THING IS MOST OF YOU IF YOU HAVE A STABLE HOME LIFE AND WHAT I MEAN IS THAT YOU DON'T TRAVEL ALL THE TIME AND ALWAYS IN HOTELS BUT MOST PEOPLE HAVE WHAT WE CALL A CENTER OF GRAVITY AND A CENTER OF GRAVITY IS WHERE
JanChipchase_2007 YOU KEEP THESE OBJECTS AND THESE THINGS DON'T STAY IN THE CENTER OF GRAVITY BUT OVER TIME THEY GRAVITATE THERE IT'S WHERE YOU EXPECT TO FIND STUFF AND IN FACT WHEN YOU'RE TURNING AROUND AND YOU'RE LOOKING INSIDE THE HOUSE AND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THIS STUFF THIS IS WHERE YOU LOOK
JanChipchase_2007 SO WHEN WE DID THIS RESEARCH WE FOUND THE ABSOLUTELY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT GUARANTEED WAY TO NEVER FORGET ANYTHING EVER EVER AGAIN
JanChipchase_2007 AND THAT IS QUITE SIMPLY
JanChipchase_2007 TO HAVE NOTHING TO REMEMBER
JanChipchase_2007 OK NOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING YOU GET ON A CHINESE FORTUNE COOKIE RIGHT BUT IS IN FACT
JanChipchase_2007 THE ART OF DELEGATION
JanChipchase_2007 AND WHAT YOU CAN DELEGATE TO OTHER PEOPLE
JanChipchase_2007 AND IT TURNS OUT DELEGATION IF YOU WANT IT TO BE CAN BE THE SOLUTION FOR PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING
JanChipchase_2007 APART FROM THINGS LIKE BODILY FUNCTIONS GOING TO THE TOILET YOU CAN'T ASK SOMEONE TO DO THAT ON YOUR BEHALF AND APART FROM THINGS LIKE ENTERTAINMENT
JanChipchase_2007 YOU WOULDN'T PAY SOMEONE TO GO TO THE CINEMA FOR YOU AND HAVE FUN
JanChipchase_2007 NOT YET MAYBE SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE
JanChipchase_2007 SO LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF DELEGATION IN PRACTICE RIGHT SO THIS IS PROBABLY THE THING I'M MOST PASSIONATE ABOUT IS THE RESEARCH THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING ON ILLITERACY AND HOW PEOPLE WHO ARE ILLITERATE COMMUNICATE
JanChipchase_2007 ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE LOOKING AT IS IF YOU CAN'T READ AND WRITE
JanChipchase_2007 BE A PHONE NUMBER IT COULD BE AN E MAIL ADDRESS IT COULD BE A POSTAL ADDRESS SIMPLE QUESTION IF YOU CAN'T READ AND WRITE HOW DO YOU MANAGE YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION AND THE FACT IS THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DO IT JUST FROM A DESIGN PERSPECTIVE WE DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THEY DID IT
JanChipchase_2007 ONE SMALL EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF RESEARCH THAT WE WERE DOING
JanChipchase_2007 AND IT TURNS OUT THAT ILLITERATE PEOPLE ARE MASTERS OF DELEGATION SO THEY DELEGATE THAT PART OF THE TASK PROCESS TO OTHER PEOPLE THE STUFF THAT THEY CAN'T DO THEMSELVES
JanChipchase_2007 LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF DELEGATION THIS ONE 'S A LITTLE BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED AND THIS IS FROM A STUDY THAT WE DID IN UGANDA ABOUT HOW PEOPLE WHO ARE SHARING DEVICES USE THOSE DEVICES
JanChipchase_2007 IS A WORD IN UGANDA THAT MEANS MONEY IT HAS A SECOND MEANING WHICH IS TO SEND MONEY AS AIRTIME
JanChipchase_2007 AND IT WORKS LIKE THIS SO LET 'S SAY JUNE YOU'RE IN A VILLAGE RURAL VILLAGE I'M IN KAMPALA
JanChipchase_2007 THE WAGE EARNER I'M SENDING MONEY BACK AND IT WORKS LIKE THIS SO IN YOUR VILLAGE THERE'S ONE PERSON IN THE VILLAGE WITH A PHONE AND THAT'S THE PHONE KIOSK OPERATOR AND IT'S QUITE LIKELY THAT THEY'D HAVE A QUITE SIMPLE MOBILE PHONE AT A
JanChipchase_2007 SO WHAT I DO IS I BUY A PREPAID CARD LIKE THIS
JanChipchase_2007 AND I READ OUT THAT NUMBER TO THEM AND THEY USE IT TO TOP UP THEIR PHONE SO THEY'RE TOPPING UP THE VALUE FROM KAMPALA AND IT'S NOW BEING TOPPED UP IN THE VILLAGE
JanChipchase_2007 YOU TAKE A TEN OR TWENTY PERCENT COMMISSION AND THEN YOU THE KIOSK OPERATOR TAKES TEN OR TWENTY PERCENT COMMISSION AND PASSES THE REST OVER TO YOU IN CASH OK THERE'S TWO THINGS I LIKE ABOUT THIS SO THE FIRST IS
JanChipchase_2007 IT TURNS ANYONE WHO HAS ACCESS TO A MOBILE PHONE ANYONE WHO HAS A MOBILE PHONE ESSENTIALLY INTO AN ATM MACHINE IT BRINGS RUDIMENTARY BANKING SERVICES
JanChipchase_2007 TO PLACES WHERE THERE'S NO BANKING INFRASTRUCTURE AND EVEN IF THEY COULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE BANKING INFRASTRUCTURE THEY WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE CONSIDERED VIABLE CUSTOMERS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WEALTHY
JanChipchase_2007 SECOND THING I LIKE ABOUT THIS AND THAT IS THAT DESPITE ALL THE RESOURCES AT MY DISPOSAL AND DESPITE ALL OUR KIND OF APPARENT SOPHISTICATION I KNOW I COULD NEVER HAVE DESIGNED SOMETHING AS ELEGANT AND
JanChipchase_2007 TOTALLY IN TUNE WITH THE LOCAL CONDITIONS AS
JanChipchase_2007 OK AND YES THERE IS THINGS LIKE GRAMEEN BANK AND MICRO LENDING BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND THAT IS THERE'S NO CENTRAL AUTHORITY TRYING TO CONTROL THIS THIS IS JUST STREET UP INNOVATION
JanChipchase_2007 SO IT TURNS OUT THE STREET IS A NEVER ENDING SOURCE OF KIND OF INSPIRATION FOR US AND OK IF YOU BREAK ONE OF THESE THINGS HERE YOU RETURN IT TO THE CARRIER THEY'LL GIVE YOU A NEW ONE THEY'LL PROBABLY GIVE YOU THREE NEW ONES RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S BUY THREE GET ONE FREE
JanChipchase_2007 YOU GO ON THE STREETS OF INDIA AND CHINA
JanChipchase_2007 YOU SEE THIS KIND OF STUFF AND THIS IS WHERE THEY TAKE THE STUFF THAT BREAKS AND THEY FIX IT AND THEY PUT IT BACK INTO CIRCULATION
JanChipchase_2007 THIS IS FROM A WORKBENCH IN JILIN CITY IN CHINA AND YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE TAKING DOWN A PHONE AND PUTTING IT BACK TOGETHER
JanChipchase_2007 THEY REVERSE ENGINEER MANUALS THIS IS
JanChipchase_2007 AND IT'S WRITTEN IN CHINESE AND ENGLISH THEY ALSO WRITE THEM IN HINDI YOU CAN SUBSCRIBE TO THESE
JanChipchase_2007 THERE ARE TRAINING INSTITUTES WHERE THEY'RE CHURNING OUT PEOPLE FOR FIXING THESE THINGS AS WELL
JanChipchase_2007 BUT WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS IS IT BOILS DOWN TO SOMEONE ON THE STREET WITH A SMALL FLAT SURFACE
JanChipchase_2007 A SCREWDRIVER A TOOTHBRUSH FOR CLEANING THE CONTACT HEADS BECAUSE THEY OFTEN GET DUST ON THE CONTACT HEADS AND KNOWLEDGE AND IT'S ALL ABOUT THE SOCIAL NETWORK OF THE KNOWLEDGE FLOATING AROUND
JanChipchase_2007 I LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT CHALLENGES THE WAY THAT WE DESIGN STUFF AND BUILD STUFF AND POTENTIALLY DISTRIBUTE STUFF IT CHALLENGES THE NORMS
JanChipchase_2007 OK FOR ME THE STREETS JUST RAISES SO MANY DIFFERENT QUESTIONS LIKE THIS IS VIAGRA THAT I BOUGHT FROM A BACKSTREET SEX SHOP IN CHINA
JanChipchase_2007 OK BUT I LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND I CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS OF TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN THE PURCHASE PROCESS
JanChipchase_2007 AND WE LOOK AT THIS AND WE THINK WELL HOW DOES THAT APPLY FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE DESIGN OF THE LESSONS FROM THIS APPLY TO THE DESIGN
JanChipchase_2007 FUTURE SERVICES IN THESE MARKETS
JanChipchase_2007 THIS IS A PAIR OF UNDERPANTS FROM
JanChipchase_2007 FROM TIBET AND I LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND HONESTLY YOU KNOW WHY WOULD SOMEONE DESIGN UNDERPANTS WITH A POCKET RIGHT AND I LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND IT MAKES ME QUESTION
JanChipchase_2007 IF WE WERE TO TAKE ALL THE FUNCTIONALITY IN THINGS LIKE THIS AND REDISTRIBUTE THEM AROUND THE BODY IN SOME KIND OF PERSONAL AREA NETWORK
JanChipchase_2007 HOW WOULD WE PRIORITIZE WHERE TO PUT STUFF AND YES THIS IS QUITE TRIVIAL BUT ACTUALLY THE LESSONS FROM THIS CAN APPLY TO THAT KIND OF PERSONAL AREA NETWORKS
JanChipchase_2007 AND WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS A COUPLE OF PHONE NUMBERS WRITTEN ABOVE THE SHACK IN RURAL UGANDA THIS DOESN'T HAVE HOUSE NUMBERS THIS HAS PHONE NUMBERS SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN
JanChipchase_2007 AND THEN I GO TO THIS PICTURE HERE WHICH IS THE ONE THAT I STARTED WITH AND THIS IS
JanChipchase_2007 THIS IS FROM DELHI IT'S FROM A STUDY WE DID INTO ILLITERACY
JanChipchase_2007 AND HE 'S A YOU KNOW INCREDIBLY POOR TEASHOP WORKER ON THE LOWEST RUNGS IN THE SOCIETY
JanChipchase_2007 AND HE SOMEHOW HAS THE APPRECIATION
JanChipchase_2007 OF THE VALUES OF LIVESTRONG
JanChipchase_2007 AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME VALUES BUT SOME KIND OF VALUES OF LIVESTRONG TO ACTUALLY GO OUT AND PURCHASE THEM
JanChipchase_2007 AND ACTUALLY DISPLAY THEM FOR ME THIS KIND OF PERSONIFIES THIS CONNECTED WORLD WHERE EVERYTHING IS INTERTWINED AND THE DOTS ARE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE DOTS JOINING TOGETHER
JanChipchase_2007 TITLE OF THIS PRESENTATION IS CONNECTIONS AND CONSEQUENCES AND IT'S REALLY A KIND OF SUMMARY OF FIVE YEARS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE
JanChipchase_2007 WHEN EVERYONE ON THE PLANET
JanChipchase_2007 HAS THE ABILITY TO TRANSCEND SPACE AND TIME
JanChipchase_2007 IN A PERSONAL AND CONVENIENT MANNER RIGHT WHEN EVERYONE 'S CONNECTED
JanChipchase_2007 AND
JanChipchase_2007 SO THE FIRST THING IS THE IMMEDIACY OF IDEAS THE SPEED AT WHICH IDEAS GO AROUND
JanChipchase_2007 IF YOU WANT A BIG IDEA YOU NEED TO EMBRACE EVERYONE ON THE PLANET
JanChipchase_2007 THESE THINGS QUITE SIMPLY
JanChipchase_2007 MOVE VERY QUICKLY AROUND THE WORLD
JanChipchase_2007 AND SO THE SPEED OF THE ADOPTION OF THINGS IS JUST GOING TO BECOME THAT MUCH MORE RAPID IN A WAY THAT WE JUST TOTALLY CANNOT CONCEIVE WHEN YOU GET IT TO SIX POINT THREE BILLION AND THE GROWTH IN THE WORLD 'S POPULATION
JanChipchase_2007 THE NEXT THING IS THAT HOWEVER WE DESIGN THIS STUFF CAREFULLY DESIGN THIS STUFF THE STREET WILL TAKE IT AND WILL FIGURE OUT WAYS TO INNOVATE AS LONG AS IT MEETS BASE NEEDS
JanChipchase_2007 AND IT WILL INNOVATE IN WAYS THAT WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE
JanChipchase_2007 IN WAYS THAT DESPITE OUR RESOURCES THEY CAN DO IT BETTER THAN US THAT'S MY FEELING AND IF WE'RE SMART WE'LL LOOK AT THIS STUFF
JanChipchase_2007 THAT'S GOING ON AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ENABLE IT TO INFORM AND INFUSE BOTH WHAT WE DESIGN AND HOW WE DESIGN
JanChipchase_2007 THE DIRECTION OF THE CONVERSATION
JanChipchase_2007 WITH ANOTHER THREE BILLION PEOPLE CONNECTED
JanChipchase_2007 THEY WANT TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION
JanChipchase_2007 AND I THINK OUR RELEVANCE AND TED 'S RELEVANCE
JanChipchase_2007 IS REALLY ABOUT
