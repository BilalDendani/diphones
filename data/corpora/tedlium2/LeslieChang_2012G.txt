LeslieChang_2012G IMAGINE THE TEENAGE FARM GIRL WHO MAKES LESS THAN A DOLLAR AN HOUR STITCHING YOUR RUNNING SHOES OR THE YOUNG CHINESE MAN WHO JUMPS OFF A ROOFTOP AFTER WORKING OVERTIME ASSEMBLING YOUR IPAD
LeslieChang_2012G WE THE BENEFICIARIES OF GLOBALIZATION SEEM TO EXPLOIT THESE VICTIMS WITH EVERY PURCHASE WE MAKE AND THE INJUSTICE FEELS EMBEDDED IN THE PRODUCTS THEMSELVES
LeslieChang_2012G SO THIS SIMPLE NARRATIVE EQUATING WESTERN DEMAND AND CHINESE SUFFERING IS APPEALING ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN MANY OF US ALREADY FEEL GUILTY ABOUT OUR IMPACT ON THE WORLD BUT IT 'S ALSO INACCURATE AND DISRESPECTFUL
LeslieChang_2012G WE MUST BE PECULIARLY SELF OBSESSED TO IMAGINE THAT WE HAVE THE POWER TO DRIVE TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD TO MIGRATE AND SUFFER IN SUCH TERRIBLE WAYS
LeslieChang_2012G IN FACT CHINA MAKES GOODS FOR MARKETS ALL OVER THE WORLD INCLUDING ITS OWN THANKS TO A COMBINATION OF FACTORS ITS LOW COSTS ITS LARGE AND EDUCATED WORKFORCE AND A FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEM THAT RESPONDS QUICKLY TO MARKET DEMANDS
LeslieChang_2012G BY FOCUSING SO MUCH ON OURSELVES AND OUR GADGETS WE HAVE RENDERED THE INDIVIDUALS ON THE OTHER END INTO INVISIBILITY
LeslieChang_2012G AS TINY AND INTERCHANGEABLE AS THE PARTS OF A MOBILE PHONE CHINESE WORKERS ARE NOT FORCED INTO FACTORIES BECAUSE OF OUR INSATIABLE DESIRE FOR IPODS THEY CHOOSE TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES IN ORDER TO EARN MONEY TO LEARN NEW SKILLS
LeslieChang_2012G AND TO SEE THE WORLD IN THE ONGOING DEBATE ABOUT GLOBALIZATION WHAT 'S BEEN MISSING IS THE VOICES OF THE WORKERS THEMSELVES
LeslieChang_2012G MY MOTHER TELLS ME TO COME HOME AND GET MARRIED BUT IF I MARRY NOW BEFORE I HAVE FULLY DEVELOPED MYSELF
LeslieChang_2012G I CAN ONLY MARRY AN ORDINARY WORKER SO I 'M NOT IN A RUSH
LeslieChang_2012G NOW AFTER I GET OFF WORK I STUDY ENGLISH BECAUSE IN THE FUTURE OUR CUSTOMERS WON 'T BE ONLY CHINESE SO WE MUST LEARN MORE LANGUAGES ALL OF THESE SPEAKERS BY THE WAY ARE YOUNG WOMEN EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN YEARS OLD
LeslieChang_2012G SO I SPENT TWO YEARS GETTING TO KNOW ASSEMBLY LINE WORKERS LIKE THESE IN THE SOUTH CHINA FACTORY CITY CALLED DONGGUAN
LeslieChang_2012G CERTAIN SUBJECTS CAME UP OVER AND OVER HOW MUCH MONEY THEY MADE WHAT KIND OF HUSBAND THEY HOPED TO MARRY WHETHER THEY SHOULD JUMP TO ANOTHER FACTORY OR STAY WHERE THEY WERE
LeslieChang_2012G OTHER SUBJECTS CAME UP ALMOST NEVER INCLUDING LIVING CONDITIONS THAT TO ME LOOKED CLOSE TO PRISON LIFE TEN OR FIFTEEN WORKERS IN ONE ROOM FIFTY PEOPLE SHARING A SINGLE BATHROOM DAYS AND NIGHTS RULED BY THE FACTORY CLOCK
LeslieChang_2012G EVERYONE THEY KNEW LIVED IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND IT WAS STILL BETTER THAN THE DORMITORIES AND HOMES OF RURAL CHINA
LeslieChang_2012G THE WORKERS RARELY SPOKE ABOUT THE PRODUCTS THEY MADE AND THEY OFTEN HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY EXPLAINING WHAT EXACTLY THEY DID
LeslieChang_2012G WHEN I ASKED LU QINGMIN THE YOUNG WOMAN I GOT TO KNOW BEST WHAT EXACTLY SHE DID ON THE FACTORY FLOOR SHE SAID SOMETHING TO ME IN CHINESE THAT SOUNDED LIKE QIU XI ONLY MUCH LATER DID I REALIZE THAT SHE HAD BEEN SAYING QC OR QUALITY CONTROL
LeslieChang_2012G SHE COULDN 'T EVEN TELL ME WHAT SHE DID ON THE FACTORY FLOOR ALL SHE COULD DO WAS PARROT A GARBLED ABBREVIATION IN A LANGUAGE SHE DIDN 'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
LeslieChang_2012G KARL MARX SAW THIS AS THE TRAGEDY OF CAPITALISM THE ALIENATION OF THE WORKER FROM THE PRODUCT OF HIS LABOR
LeslieChang_2012G UNLIKE SAY A TRADITIONAL MAKER OF SHOES OR CABINETS THE WORKER IN AN INDUSTRIAL FACTORY HAS NO CONTROL NO PLEASURE AND NO TRUE SATISFACTION OR UNDERSTANDING IN HER OWN WORK
LeslieChang_2012G BUT LIKE SO MANY THEORIES THAT MARX ARRIVED AT SITTING IN THE READING ROOM OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM HE GOT THIS ONE WRONG
LeslieChang_2012G JUST BECAUSE A PERSON SPENDS HER TIME MAKING A PIECE OF SOMETHING DOES NOT MEAN THAT SHE BECOMES THAT A PIECE OF SOMETHING WHAT SHE DOES WITH THE MONEY SHE EARNS WHAT SHE LEARNS IN THAT PLACE AND HOW IT CHANGES HER THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT MATTER
LeslieChang_2012G WHAT A FACTORY MAKES IS NEVER THE POINT AND THE WORKERS COULD NOT CARE LESS WHO BUYS THEIR PRODUCTS JOURNALISTIC COVERAGE
LeslieChang_2012G FOR EXAMPLE AN ENTRY LEVEL LINE ASSEMBLY LINE WORKER IN CHINA IN AN IPHONE PLANT WOULD HAVE TO SHELL OUT TWO AND A HALF MONTHS WAGES
LeslieChang_2012G FOR AN IPHONE BUT HOW MEANINGFUL IS THIS CALCULATION REALLY FOR EXAMPLE I RECENTLY WROTE AN ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORKER MAGAZINE BUT I CAN 'T AFFORD TO BUY AN AD IN IT
LeslieChang_2012G BUT WHO CARES I DON 'T WANT AN AD IN THE NEW YORKER AND MOST OF THESE WORKERS DON 'T REALLY WANT IPHONES THEIR CALCULATIONS ARE DIFFERENT HOW LONG SHOULD I STAY IN THIS FACTORY HOW MUCH MONEY CAN I SAVE HOW MUCH WILL IT TAKE TO BUY AN APARTMENT OR A CAR TO GET MARRIED OR TO PUT MY CHILD THROUGH SCHOOL
LeslieChang_2012G THE WORKERS I GOT TO KNOW HAD A CURIOUSLY ABSTRACT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRODUCT OF THEIR LABOR
LeslieChang_2012G ABOUT A YEAR AFTER I MET LU QINGMIN OR MIN SHE INVITED ME HOME TO HER FAMILY VILLAGE FOR THE CHINESE NEW YEAR ON THE TRAIN HOME SHE GAVE ME A PRESENT A COACH BRAND CHANGE PURSE WITH BROWN LEATHER TRIM I THANKED HER ASSUMING IT WAS FAKE LIKE ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE FOR SALE IN DONGGUAN
LeslieChang_2012G AFTER WE GOT HOME MIN GAVE HER MOTHER ANOTHER PRESENT A PINK DOONEY BOURKE HANDBAG AND A FEW NIGHTS LATER HER SISTER WAS SHOWING OFF A MAROON LESPORTSAC SHOULDER BAG
LeslieChang_2012G SLOWLY IT WAS DAWNING ON ME THAT THESE HANDBAGS WERE MADE BY THEIR FACTORY AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WAS AUTHENTIC
LeslieChang_2012G ONE BAG WILL SELL FOR SIX THOUSAND SHE PAUSED AND SAID I DON 'T KNOW IF THAT
LeslieChang_2012G ONCE WHEN MIN 'S OLDER SISTER 'S FRIEND GOT MARRIED SHE BROUGHT A HANDBAG ALONG AS A WEDDING PRESENT ANOTHER TIME AFTER MIN HAD ALREADY LEFT THE HANDBAG FACTORY HER YOUNGER SISTER CAME TO VISIT BRINGING TWO COACH SIGNATURE HANDBAGS AS GIFTS
LeslieChang_2012G I LOOKED IN THE ZIPPERED POCKET OF ONE AND I FOUND A PRINTED CARD IN ENGLISH WHICH READ
LeslieChang_2012G AN AMERICAN CLASSIC IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE THE BURNISHED PATINA OF AN ALL AMERICAN BASEBALL GLOVE
LeslieChang_2012G INSPIRED THE FOUNDER OF COACH TO CREATE A NEW COLLECTION OF HANDBAGS FROM THE SAME LUXURIOUSLY SOFT GLOVED HAND LEATHER
LeslieChang_2012G SIX SKILLED LEATHERWORKERS CRAFTED TWELVE SIGNATURE HANDBAGS WITH PERFECT PROPORTIONS AND A TIMELESS FLAIR THEY WERE FRESH FUNCTIONAL AND WOMEN EVERYWHERE ADORED THEM A NEW AMERICAN CLASSIC WAS BORN
LeslieChang_2012G I WONDER WHAT KARL MARX WOULD HAVE MADE OF MIN AND HER SISTERS THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRODUCT OF THEIR LABOR WAS MORE COMPLICATED SURPRISING AND FUNNY THAN HE COULD HAVE IMAGINED
LeslieChang_2012G AND YET HIS VIEW OF THE WORLD PERSISTS AND OUR TENDENCY TO SEE THE WORKERS AS FACELESS MASSES TO IMAGINE THAT WE CAN KNOW WHAT THEY 'RE REALLY THINKING
LeslieChang_2012G THE FIRST TIME I MET MIN SHE HAD JUST TURNED EIGHTEEN AND QUIT HER FIRST JOB ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE OF AN ELECTRONICS FACTORY
LeslieChang_2012G OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS I WATCHED AS SHE SWITCHED JOBS FIVE TIMES EVENTUALLY LANDING A LUCRATIVE POST IN THE PURCHASING DEPARTMENT OF A HARDWARE FACTORY
LeslieChang_2012G LATER SHE MARRIED A FELLOW MIGRANT WORKER MOVED WITH HIM TO HIS VILLAGE GAVE BIRTH TO TWO DAUGHTERS AND SAVED ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY A SECONDHAND BUICK FOR HERSELF AND AN APARTMENT FOR HER PARENTS
LeslieChang_2012G SHE RECENTLY RETURNED TO DONGGUAN ON HER OWN TO TAKE A JOB IN A FACTORY THAT MAKES CONSTRUCTION CRANES TEMPORARILY LEAVING HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN BACK IN THE VILLAGE IN A RECENT EMAIL TO ME SHE EXPLAINED
LeslieChang_2012G A PERSON SHOULD HAVE SOME AMBITION WHILE SHE IS YOUNG SO THAT IN OLD AGE SHE CAN LOOK BACK ON HER LIFE AND FEEL THAT IT WAS NOT LIVED TO NO PURPOSE
LeslieChang_2012G ACROSS CHINA THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION WORKERS LIKE HER ONE THIRD OF THEM WOMEN WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR VILLAGES TO WORK IN THE FACTORIES THE HOTELS THE RESTAURANTS AND THE CONSTRUCTION SITES OF THE BIG CITIES TOGETHER THEY MAKE UP THE LARGEST MIGRATION IN HISTORY
LeslieChang_2012G AND IT IS GLOBALIZATION THIS CHAIN THAT BEGINS IN A CHINESE FARMING VILLAGE AND ENDS WITH IPHONES IN OUR POCKETS AND NIKES ON OUR FEET AND COACH HANDBAGS ON OUR ARMS THAT HAS CHANGED THE WAY THESE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORK AND MARRY AND LIVE AND THINK
LeslieChang_2012G WHEN I FIRST WENT TO DONGGUAN I WORRIED THAT IT WOULD BE DEPRESSING TO SPEND SO MUCH TIME WITH WORKERS I ALSO WORRIED THAT NOTHING WOULD EVER HAPPEN TO THEM OR THAT THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO ME
LeslieChang_2012G INSTEAD I FOUND YOUNG WOMEN WHO WERE SMART AND FUNNY AND BRAVE AND GENEROUS BY OPENING UP THEIR LIVES TO ME THEY TAUGHT ME SO MUCH ABOUT FACTORIES AND ABOUT CHINA AND ABOUT HOW TO LIVE IN THE WORLD
LeslieChang_2012G THIS IS THE COACH PURSE THAT MIN GAVE ME ON THE TRAIN HOME TO VISIT HER FAMILY
LeslieChang_2012G I KEEP IT WITH ME TO REMIND ME OF THE TIES THAT TIE ME TO THE YOUNG WOMEN I WROTE ABOUT TIES THAT ARE NOT ECONOMIC BUT PERSONAL IN NATURE MEASURED NOT IN MONEY BUT IN MEMORIES
LeslieChang_2012G THIS PURSE IS ALSO A REMINDER THAT THE THINGS THAT YOU IMAGINE SITTING IN YOUR OFFICE OR IN THE LIBRARY ARE NOT HOW YOU FIND THEM WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GO OUT INTO THE WORLD THANK YOU
LeslieChang_2012G REALLY REALLY RUDIMENTARY THINGS YOU KNOW LIKE HOW TO TYPE A DOCUMENT IN WORD OR HOW TO SAY REALLY SIMPLE THINGS IN ENGLISH
LeslieChang_2012G YOU CAN HELP THEIR SOCIAL MOBILITY AND THEIR SELF IMPROVEMENT WHEN YOU TALK TO WORKERS THAT 'S WHAT THEY WANT THEY DO NOT SAY I WANT BETTER HOT WATER IN THE SHOWERS I WANT A NICER ROOM I WANT A TV SET I MEAN IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THOSE THINGS BUT THAT 'S NOT WHY THEY 'RE IN THE CITY AND THAT 'S NOT WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT
LeslieChang_2012G UPWARD DOWNWARD SIDEWAYS BUT GENERALLY UPWARD IF YOU SPEND ENOUGH TIME IT 'S UPWARD AND I MET PEOPLE WHO HAD MOVED TO THE CITY TEN YEARS AGO AND WHO ARE NOW BASICALLY URBAN MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE
LeslieChang_2012G SO THE TRAJECTORY IS DEFINITELY UPWARD IT 'S JUST HARD TO SEE WHEN YOU 'RE SUDDENLY SUCKED INTO THE CITY IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE 'S POOR AND DESPERATE BUT THAT 'S NOT REALLY HOW IT IS CERTAINLY THE FACTORY CONDITIONS ARE REALLY TOUGH AND IT 'S NOTHING YOU OR I WOULD WANT TO DO BUT
LeslieChang_2012G FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE WHERE THEY 'RE COMING FROM IS MUCH WORSE AND WHERE THEY 'RE GOING IS HOPEFULLY MUCH BETTER AND I JUST WANTED TO GIVE THAT CONTEXT OF WHAT 'S GOING ON IN THEIR MINDS NOT WHAT NECESSARILY IS GOING ON IN YOURS CA THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR TALK THANK YOU
