FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P ABOUT COMPASSION FROM AN ISLAMIC POINT OF VIEW AND PERHAPS MY FAITH IS NOT VERY WELL THOUGHT OF AS BEING ONE THAT IS GROUNDED IN COMPASSION
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS OTHERWISE OUR HOLY BOOK THE KORAN CONSISTS OF ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN CHAPTERS
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P EACH CHAPTER BEGINS WITH WHAT WE CALL THE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THE SAYING IN THE NAME OF GOD THE ALL COMPASSIONATE THE ALL MERCIFUL OR AS SIR RICHARD BURTON
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P NOT THE RICHARD BURTON WHO WAS MARRIED TO ELIZABETH TAYLOR
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P BUT THE SIR RICHARD BURTON WHO LIVED A CENTURY BEFORE THAT AND WHO WAS A WORLD WIDE TRAVELER AND TRANSLATOR OF MANY WORKS OF LITERATURE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P TRANSLATES IT AS IN THE NAME OF GOD THE COMPASSIONATING THE COMPASSIONATE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND IN A SAYING OF THE KORAN WHICH TO MUSLIMS IS GOD SPEAKING TO HUMANITY GOD SAYS TO HIS PROPHET MUHAMMAD
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P WHOM WE BELIEVE TO BE THE LAST OF A SERIES OF PROPHETS BEGINNING WITH ADAM INCLUDING NOAH INCLUDING MOSES INCLUDING ABRAHAM INCLUDING JESUS CHRIST AND ENDING WITH MUHAMMAD
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THAT WE HAVE NOT SENT YOU OH MUHAMMAD EXCEPT AS A RAHAM EXCEPT AS A SOURCE OF COMPASSION TO HUMANITY AND FOR US HUMAN BEINGS AND CERTAINLY FOR US AS MUSLIMS
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND WHOSE PURPOSE IN FOLLOWING THE PATH OF THE PROPHET IS TO MAKE OURSELVES AS MUCH LIKE THE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND THE PROPHET IN ONE OF HIS SAYINGS SAID ADORN YOURSELVES WITH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD AND BECAUSE GOD HIMSELF SAID THAT THE PRIMARY ATTRIBUTE OF HIS IS COMPASSION
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P IN FACT THE KORAN SAYS THAT GOD DECREED UPON HIMSELF COMPASSION OR REIGNED HIMSELF IN
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P OF COMPASSION ACTORS OF COMPASSION AND SPEAKERS OF COMPASSION AND DOERS OF COMPASSION THAT IS ALL WELL AND GOOD
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P BUT WHERE DO WE GO WRONG AND WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THE LACK OF COMPASSION IN THE WORLD FOR THE ANSWER TO THIS WE TURN TO OUR SPIRITUAL PATH
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P IN EVERY RELIGIOUS TRADITION THERE IS WHAT YOU CALL THE OUTER PATH AND THE INNER PATH
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P OR THE EXOTERIC PATH AND THE ESOTERIC PATH
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THE ESOTERIC PATH OF ISLAM IS MORE POPULARLY KNOWN AS SUFISM OR TASAWWUF IN ARABIC
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND THESE DOCTORS OR THESE MASTERS THESE SPIRITUAL MASTERS OF THE SUFI TRADITION REFER TO TEACHINGS AND EXAMPLES OF OUR PROPHET
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THAT TEACH US WHERE THE SOURCE OF OUR PROBLEMS LIE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P IN ONE OF THE BATTLES THAT THE PROPHET WAGED HE TOLD HIS FOLLOWERS WE ARE RETURNING FROM THE LESSER WAR TO THE GREATER WAR TO THE GREATER BATTLE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND THEY SAID MESSENGER OF GOD WE ARE BATTLE WEARY HOW CAN WE GO TO A GREATER BATTLE HE SAID THAT IS THE BATTLE OF THE SELF THE BATTLE OF THE EGO
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THE SOURCES OF HUMAN PROBLEMS HAVE TO DO WITH EGOTISM I
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THE FAMOUS SUFI MASTER RUMI WHO IS VERY WELL KNOWN TO MOST OF YOU
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P HAS A STORY IN WHICH HE TALKS OF A MAN WHO GOES TO THE HOUSE OF A FRIEND AND KNOCKS ON THE DOOR
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND A VOICE ANSWERS WHO 'S THERE IT 'S ME OR MORE GRAMMATICALLY CORRECTLY IT IS I AS WE MIGHT SAY IN ENGLISH THE VOICE SAYS GO
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AFTER MANY YEARS OF TRAINING OF DISCIPLINING OF SEARCH AND STRUGGLE HE COMES BACK AND WITH MUCH GREATER HUMILITY HE KNOCKS AGAIN ON THE DOOR
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THE VOICE ASKS WHO IS THERE HE SAID IT IS YOU OH HEARTBREAKER THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND THE VOICE SAYS COME IN FOR THERE IS NO ROOM IN THIS HOUSE FOR TWO
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P NOT THESE EYES FOR TWO EGOS
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND RUMI 'S STORIES ARE METAPHORS FOR THE SPIRITUAL PATH
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD THERE IS NO ROOM FOR MORE THAN ONE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND THAT IS THE I OF DIVINITY
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P IN A TEACHING CALLED A HADITH QUDSI IN OUR TRADITION GOD SAYS THAT MY SERVANT OR MY CREATURE MY HUMAN CREATURE DOES NOT APPROACH ME
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THAT IS DEARER TO ME THAN WHAT I HAVE ASKED THEM TO DO
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P YOU WANT YOUR EMPLOYEES TO DO WHAT YOU ASK THEM TO DO AND IF THEY'VE DONE THAT THEN THEY CAN DO EXTRA BUT DON'T IGNORE WHAT YOU'VE ASKED THEM TO DO
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND GOD SAYS
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P MY SERVANT CONTINUES TO GET NEARER TO ME BY DOING MORE OF WHAT I'VE ASKED THEM TO DO EXTRA CREDIT WE MIGHT CALL
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P UNTIL I LOVE HIM OR LOVE HER AND WHEN I LOVE MY SERVANT GOD SAYS I BECOME
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P BY WHICH HE OR SHE SEES
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THE EARS BY WHICH HE OR SHE LISTENS
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P BY WHICH HE OR SHE WALKS AND THE HEART
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P BY WHICH HE OR SHE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P WITH DIVINITY THAT IS THE LESSON AND PURPOSE OF OUR SPIRITUAL PATH AND ALL OF OUR FAITH TRADITIONS
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P MUSLIMS REGARD JESUS AS THE MASTER OF
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P WHEN HE SAYS I AM THE SPIRIT AND I AM THE WAY WHEN THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD SAID WHOEVER HAS SEEN ME HAS SEEN GOD
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P IT IS BECAUSE THEY BECAME SO MUCH AN INSTRUMENT
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P OF GOD THEY BECAME PART OF GOD 'S STEAM SO THAT GOD 'S WILL WAS MANIFEST THROUGH THEM AND NOT ACTING FROM THEIR OWN SELF
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P IS GIVEN IT IS IN US
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TO GET OUR EGOS OUT OF THE WAY GET OUR EGOTISM OUT OF THE WAY
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P SURE PROBABLY ALL OF YOU HERE OR CERTAINLY THE VERY VAST MAJORITY OF YOU HAVE HAD
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE A MOMENT IN YOUR LIVES WHEN FOR A FEW SECONDS A MINUTE PERHAPS
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P EGO DISSOLVED
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P OF WATER ONE WITH EVERY HUMAN BEING ONE WITH THE CREATOR AND YOU FELT IN THE PRESENCE OF POWER OF AWE OF THE DEEPEST LOVE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P A GIFT WHEN FOR A MOMENT HE LIFTS THAT BOUNDARY WHICH MAKES US INSIST ON I I I ME ME ME
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND INSTEAD LIKE THE PERSON IN RUMI 'S STORY WE SAY OH THIS IS ALL
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THIS IS ALL YOU
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND THIS IS ALL US
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P US AND I AND
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P ALL PART OF YOU
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P ALL CREATOR ALL THE OBJECTIVE THE SOURCE OF OUR BEING AND THE END OF OUR JOURNEY
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P YOU ARE ALSO THE BREAKER OF OUR HEARTS
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P YOU ARE THE ONE WHOM WE SHOULD ALL BE TOWARDS FOR WHOSE PURPOSE WE LIVE AND FOR WHOSE PURPOSE WE SHALL DIE AND FOR
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P SHALL BE RESURRECTED AGAIN TO ACCOUNT TO GOD TO WHAT EXTENT WE HAVE BEEN COMPASSIONATE BEINGS OUR MESSAGE TODAY
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND OUR PURPOSE TODAY AND THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE HERE TODAY AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS CHARTER OF COMPASSION IS TO REMIND FOR THE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P ALWAYS URGES US TO REMEMBER TO REMIND EACH OTHER BECAUSE THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P IS WITHIN EVERY HUMAN BEING
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THROUGH OUR SUBCONSCIOUS IN YOUR DREAMS WHICH THE KORAN CALLS OUR
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P STATE OF SLEEP THE LESSER DEATH
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P IN OUR STATE OF SLEEP WE HAVE DREAMS WE HAVE VISIONS WE TRAVEL
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P EVEN OUTSIDE OF OUR BODIES FOR MANY OF US
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND WE SEE WONDERFUL THINGS WE TRAVEL BEYOND THE LIMITATIONS OF SPACE AS WE KNOW IT AND BEYOND THE LIMITATIONS OF TIME AS WE KNOW IT
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P IS FOR US TO
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THE NAME OF THE CREATOR
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P WHOSE PRIMARY NAME IS THE COMPASSIONATING THE COMPASSIONATE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P WHATEVER NAME YOU WANT TO CALL HIM WITH ALLAH RAM OM WHATEVER THE NAME MIGHT BE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THROUGH WHICH YOU NAME OR ACCESS
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THE PRESENCE OF DIVINITY
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P IS THE LOCUS
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM WHAT HINDUS CALL SATCHIDANANDA THE LANGUAGE DIFFERS
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P BUT THE OBJECTIVE IS THE SAME
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P RUMI HAS ANOTHER STORY
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P ABOUT THREE A TURK AN ARAB
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P ONE IS ASKING FOR GRAPES AND THEY HAVE A FIGHT AND AN ARGUMENT BECAUSE I WANT GRAPES I WANT ENEB I WANT
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P NOT KNOWING THAT THE WORD THAT THEY'RE USING
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THE SAME REALITY IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THERE'S ONLY ONE ABSOLUTE REALITY BY DEFINITION
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P ONE ABSOLUTE BEING BY DEFINITION BECAUSE ABSOLUTE IS BY DEFINITION SINGLE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND ABSOLUTE AND SINGULAR
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P ABSOLUTE CONCENTRATION OF BEING THE ABSOLUTE CONCENTRATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS AWARENESS AN ABSOLUTE LOCUS
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THAT DEFINES THE PRIMARY ATTRIBUTES OF DIVINITY
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND THAT SHOULD ALSO BE THE PRIMARY ATTRIBUTES OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P FOR WHAT DEFINES HUMANITY PERHAPS BIOLOGICALLY
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P IS OUR PHYSIOLOGY
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THE KORAN SAYS HE SPEAKS TO THE ANGELS AND SAYS WHEN I HAVE FINISHED THE FORMATION OF ADAM FROM
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND BREATHED INTO HIM OF MY SPIRIT THEN FALL IN PROSTRATION TO HIM THE ANGELS
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P PROSTRATE NOT BEFORE THE HUMAN BODY
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P BUT BEFORE THE HUMAN SOUL WHY BECAUSE THE SOUL THE HUMAN SOUL EMBODIES
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P A PIECE OF THE DIVINE BREATH
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P A PIECE OF THE DIVINE SOUL
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THIS IS ALSO EXPRESSED IN BIBLICAL VOCABULARY WHEN WE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P WE WERE CREATED IN THE DIVINE IMAGE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P WHAT IS THE IMAGERY OF GOD
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THE IMAGERY OF GOD IS ABSOLUTE BEING ABSOLUTE AWARENESS AND KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM AND ABSOLUTE COMPASSION
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND LOVE AND THEREFORE FOR US TO BE HUMAN
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P IN THE GREATEST SENSE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN IN THE MOST JOYFUL SENSE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN MEANS THAT WE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P HAVE TO BE PROPER STEWARDS
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P OF THE BREATH OF DIVINITY WITHIN US
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND TO SEEK TO PERFECT WITHIN OURSELVES THE ATTRIBUTE OF BEING OF BEING ALIVE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THE ATTRIBUTE OF WISDOM OF CONSCIOUSNESS OF AWARENESS
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND THE ATTRIBUTE OF BEING COMPASSIONATE AND LOVING BEINGS THIS
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM MY FAITH
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND THIS IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM MY STUDIES OF OTHER FAITH TRADITIONS
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND THIS IS THE COMMON PLATFORM
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P ON WHICH WE MUST ALL STAND AND WHEN WE STAND ON THIS PLATFORM AS SUCH I AM CONVINCED
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THAT WE CAN MAKE A WONDERFUL WORLD AND I BELIEVE PERSONALLY THAT WE'RE ON THE VERGE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND THAT WITH THE PRESENCE AND HELP OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU HERE WE CAN BRING ABOUT
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THE PROPHECY OF ISIAH FOR HE FORETOLD OF A PERIOD WHEN PEOPLE SHALL TRANSFORM
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THEIR SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND WILL NOT LEARN WAR AND MAKE WAR ANYMORE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P LOWER OUR
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P AND LET ALL BE FOR THE GLORIFICATION OF THE ONE
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS
