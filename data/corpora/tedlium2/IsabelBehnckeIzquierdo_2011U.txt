IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U THAT MEANS WE ALL SHARE A COMMON ANCESTOR AN EVOLUTIONARY GRANDMOTHER WHO LIVED AROUND SIX MILLION YEARS AGO
IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U NOW CHIMPANZEES ARE WELL KNOWN FOR THEIR AGGRESSION
IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U BUT BONOBOS SHOW US THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN WHILE CHIMPANZEES ARE DOMINATED BY BIG SCARY GUYS BONOBO SOCIETY IS RUN BY EMPOWERED FEMALES
IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U BUT UNFORTUNATELY BONOBOS ARE THE LEAST UNDERSTOOD OF THE GREAT APES THEY LIVE IN THE DEPTHS OF THE CONGOLESE JUNGLE AND IT HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO STUDY THEM THE CONGO IS A PARADOX A LAND OF EXTRAORDINARY BIODIVERSITY AND BEAUTY
IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U BUT ALSO THE HEART OF DARKNESS ITSELF THE SCENE OF A VIOLENT CONFLICT THAT HAS RAGED FOR DECADES AND CLAIMED NEARLY AS MANY LIVES AS THE FIRST WORLD WAR
IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U NOT SURPRISINGLY THIS DESTRUCTION ALSO ENDANGERS BONOBO SURVIVAL BUSHMEAT TRADES AND FOREST LOSS MEANS WE COULDN 'T FILL A SMALL STADIUM WITH ALL THE BONOBOS THAT ARE LEFT IN THE WORLD AND WE 'RE NOT EVEN SURE OF THAT TO BE HONEST
IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U PLAY INCREASES CREATIVITY AND RESILIENCE AND IT 'S ALL ABOUT THE GENERATION OF DIVERSITY DIVERSITY OF INTERACTIONS DIVERSITY OF BEHAVIORS DIVERSITY OF CONNECTIONS
IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U AND RITUAL PLAY IS THE GLUE THAT BINDS US TOGETHER
IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U NOW I DON 'T KNOW HOW YOU PLAY BUT I WANT TO SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF UNIQUE CLIPS FRESH FROM THE WILD FIRST IT 'S A BALL GAME BONOBO STYLE AND I DO NOT MEAN FOOTBALL SO HERE WE HAVE A YOUNG FEMALE AND A MALE ENGAGED IN A CHASE GAME
IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U I THINK THAT HE 'S RATHER LOVING IT HERE RIGHT
IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U THIS VIDEO 'S REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT SHOWS THE INVENTIVENESS OF BRINGING UNUSUAL ELEMENTS INTO PLAY SUCH AS TESTICLES AND ALSO HOW PLAY BOTH REQUIRES TRUST AND FOSTERS TRUST
IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U SO THESE ARE JUST SMALL TASTERS INTO THE INSIGHTS THAT BONOBO GIVE US TO OUR PAST AND PRESENT
IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U IN ORDER TO ADAPT SUCCESSFULLY TO A CHANGING WORLD WE NEED TO PLAY
IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U BUT WILL WE MAKE THE MOST OF OUR PLAYFULNESS PLAY IS NOT FRIVOLOUS
