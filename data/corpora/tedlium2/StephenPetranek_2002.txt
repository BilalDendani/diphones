StephenPetranek_2002@12.87:18.36 THE ADVANCES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN ASTRONOMY COSMOLOGY
StephenPetranek_2002@20.58:34.28 AND BIOLOGY IN THE LAST TEN YEARS ARE REALLY EXTRAORDINARY TO THE POINT WHERE WE KNOW MORE ABOUT OUR UNIVERSE AND HOW IT WORKS THAN MANY OF YOU
StephenPetranek_2002@44.58:52.18 REALLY IS A BLACK HOLE AT THE CENTER OF EVERY GALAXY THE SCIENCE WRITERS AND EDITORS I SHOULDN 'T SAY SCIENCE WRITERS I SHOULD SAY PEOPLE WHO
StephenPetranek_2002@55.51:67.19 AND EDITORS WOULD SIT DOWN OVER A COUPLE OF BEERS AFTER A HARD DAY OF WORK AND START TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THESE INCREDIBLE PERCEPTIONS ABOUT HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS AND
StephenPetranek_2002@67.68:76.00 THEY WOULD INEVITABLY END UP IN WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A VERY BIZARRE PLACE WHICH IS WAYS THE WORLD COULD END VERY SUDDENLY AND THAT'S WHAT I
StephenPetranek_2002@94.97:96.89 ALL SEEMED A LITTLE FANTASTICAL TO ME BUT
StephenPetranek_2002@111.90:125.33 NOT AFTER THIS AND THAT GOT ME INTO A DISCUSSION WITH SOME OTHER PEOPLE OTHER SCIENTISTS ABOUT MAYBE SOME OTHER SUBJECTS AND ONE OF THE GUYS I TALKED TO WHO WAS A NEUROSCIENTIST SAID YOU KNOW
StephenPetranek_2002@128.54:135.09 REMINDS ME OF MICHAEL 'S TALK YESTERDAY AND HIS MOTHER SAYING YOU CAN'T HAVE A SOLUTION
StephenPetranek_2002@136.37:143.85 SO WE WENT OUT LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS TO WAYS THAT THE WORLD MIGHT END TOMORROW AND LO AND BEHOLD WE FOUND
StephenPetranek_2002@144.49:146.89 WHICH LEADS ME TO A VIDEOTAPE
StephenPetranek_2002@171.16:180.90 TWO TRILLION DOLLAR FEDERAL BUDGET WHICH WILL LAND US BACK INTO DEFICIT SPENDING REAL FAST BUT TERRORISTS AREN'T THE ONLY THREAT WE FACE THERE ARE
StephenPetranek_2002@181.94:193.92 REALLY SERIOUS CALAMITIES STARING US IN THE EYE THAT WE'RE IN THE SAME KIND OF DENIAL ABOUT THAT WE WERE ABOUT TERRORISM AND WHAT COULD 'VE HAPPENED ON SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH I WOULD PROPOSE THEREFORE
StephenPetranek_2002@196.32:205.26 THAT IF WE TOOK TEN BILLION DOLLARS FROM THAT TWO POINT ONE THREE TRILLION DOLLAR BUDGET WHICH IS ONE OR IS TWO ONE HUNDRED THS OF THAT
StephenPetranek_2002@207.01:213.13 AND WE DOLED OUT A BILLION DOLLARS TO EACH ONE OF THESE PROBLEMS I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE
StephenPetranek_2002@225.15:226.64 TO ME THESE ARE RICHARD
StephenPetranek_2002@230.54:230.92 BUT I
StephenPetranek_2002@232.89:242.39 BECAUSE I THINK THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM CAN LITERALLY CHANGE THE WORLD I HOPE YOU TAKE SOME OF THIS STUFF AWAY WITH YOU AND WHEN YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO
StephenPetranek_2002@244.35:245.09 TRY TO GET SOME
StephenPetranek_2002@246.29:253.95 ON SOME OF THESE IDEAS SO LET 'S START NUMBER TEN WE LOSE THE WILL
StephenPetranek_2002@257.44:263.85 WE LIVE IN AN INCREDIBLE AGE OF MODERN MEDICINE WE ARE ALL MUCH HEALTHIER THAN WE WERE
StephenPetranek_2002@264.61:272.82 PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ARE GETTING BETTER MEDICINE BUT MENTALLY WE'RE FALLING APART THE WORLD HEALTH
StephenPetranek_2002@273.77:281.05 NOW ESTIMATES THAT ONE OUT OF FIVE PEOPLE ON THE PLANET IS CLINICALLY DEPRESSED AND
StephenPetranek_2002@281.84:288.67 THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION ALSO SAYS THAT DEPRESSION IS THE BIGGEST EPIDEMIC THAT HUMANKIND
StephenPetranek_2002@291.17:298.79 SOON GENETIC BREAKTHROUGHS AND EVEN BETTER MEDICINE ARE GOING TO ALLOW US TO THINK OF ONE HUNDRED
StephenPetranek_2002@298.93:308.94 AS A NORMAL LIFE SPAN A FEMALE CHILD BORN TOMORROW ON AVERAGE MEDIAN WILL LIVE TO AGE EIGHTY THREE OUR LIFE
StephenPetranek_2002@329.80:334.58 SOMETHING LIKE NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF ALL PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION AND I MEAN REALLY SEVERE
StephenPetranek_2002@339.26:345.36 THIS IS A CURABLE DISEASE WITH PRESENT MEDICINE AND PRESENT TECHNOLOGY BUT IT IS OFTEN A COMBINATION
StephenPetranek_2002@346.01:353.79 TALK THERAPY AND PILLS PILLS ALONE DON'T DO IT ESPECIALLY IN CLINICALLY DEPRESSED PEOPLE YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GO TO A
StephenPetranek_2002@355.48:363.22 OR A PSYCHOLOGIST AND PUT DOWN YOUR TEN DOLLAR CO PAY AND GET TREATED JUST LIKE YOU DO WHEN YOU GOT A CUT ON YOUR ARM IT'S RIDICULOUS SECONDLY
StephenPetranek_2002@364.32:371.01 DRUG COMPANIES ARE NOT GOING TO DEVELOP REALLY SOPHISTICATED PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS WE KNOW THAT MOST
StephenPetranek_2002@372.63:381.86 MENTAL ILLNESSES HAVE A BIOLOGICAL COMPONENT THAT CAN BE DEALT WITH AND WE KNOW JUST AN AMAZING AMOUNT MORE ABOUT THE BRAIN NOW THAN WE DID TEN YEARS AGO
StephenPetranek_2002@382.96:394.74 WE NEED A PUMP PUSH FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH NIH AND NATIONAL SCIENCE NSF AND PLACES LIKE THAT TO START HELPING THE DRUG COMPANIES DEVELOP SOME ADVANCED PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS
StephenPetranek_2002@419.43:423.61 ALL OF THE ONES WE'VE FOUND BY THE WAY ARE IN THIS LITTLE TEENY TINY CORNER WHERE WE LIVE IN THE MILKY WAY
StephenPetranek_2002@425.14:435.51 THERE MUST BE MILLIONS OF PLANETS IN THE MILKY WAY AND AS CARL SAGAN INSISTED FOR MANY YEARS AND WAS LAUGHED AT FOR IT THERE MUST BE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS IN THE UNIVERSE
StephenPetranek_2002@435.99:445.36 IN A FEW YEARS NASA IS GONNA LAUNCH FOUR OR FIVE TELESCOPES OUT TO JUPITER WHERE THERE'S LESS DUST AND START LOOKING FOR EARTH LIKE PLANETS WHICH WE CANNOT SEE
StephenPetranek_2002@456.18:463.89 AND PROBABLY FAIRLY CLOSE TO US IS A FAIRLY REMOTE IDEA AND THE CHANCE THAT SOME OF IT ISN'T MORE INTELLIGENT THAN OURS IS ALSO
StephenPetranek_2002@482.21:488.63 A GREAT LIKELIHOOD I REALLY BELIEVE THIS AND I DON'T BELIEVE IN ALIENS BUT AND I
StephenPetranek_2002@491.76:497.17 A LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL CONFRONT A CIVILIZATION THAT IS MORE INTELLIGENT THAN OUR OWN NOW WHAT WILL
StephenPetranek_2002@498.65:505.60 WHAT IF THEY COME TO YOU KNOW SUCK UP OUR OCEANS FOR THE HYDROGEN AND SWAT US AWAY LIKE FLIES THE WAY WE
StephenPetranek_2002@514.70:524.33 ADVANCED WESTERN CIVILIZATION HAS HAD A DESTRUCTIVE EFFECT ON ALL PRIMITIVE CIVILIZATIONS IT HAS COME IN CONTACT WITH EVEN IN THOSE CASES WHERE EVERY ATTEMPT WAS MADE
StephenPetranek_2002@524.93:526.97 TO PROTECT AND GUARD THE
StephenPetranek_2002@545.72:557.34 IT MAY SEEM RIDICULOUS BUT WE HAVE A REALLY LOUSY HISTORY OF ANTICIPATING THINGS LIKE THIS AND ACTUALLY BEING PREPARED FOR THEM HOW MUCH ENERGY AND MONEY DOES IT TAKE TO ACTUALLY HAVE A PLAN
StephenPetranek_2002@557.77:559.04 TO NEGOTIATE WITH AN
StephenPetranek_2002@572.97:580.27 LAST FOREVER OUR SUN DOESN'T LAST FOREVER IF WE WANT HUMANITY TO LAST FOREVER WE HAVE TO COLONIZE THE MILKY WAY
StephenPetranek_2002@590.15:595.93 A LOT IF WE MEET AN ADVANCED CIVILIZATION ALONG THE WAY IF WE'RE TRYING TO BE AN ADVANCED CIVILIZATION NUMBER
StephenPetranek_2002@618.61:625.16 THEY SAID WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE OCEANS FOR A LONG TIME NOW AND WE WANNA TELL YOU THEY'RE NOT IN TROUBLE THEY'RE NEAR COLLAPSE
StephenPetranek_2002@626.15:636.58 MANY OTHER ECOSYSTEMS ON EARTH ARE IN REAL REAL DANGER WE'RE LIVING IN A TIME OF MASS EXTINCTIONS THAT EXCEEDS THE FOSSIL RECORD BY A FACTOR OF TEN THOUSAND
StephenPetranek_2002@637.10:644.42 WE HAVE LOST TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE UNIQUE SPECIES IN HAWAII IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS CALIFORNIA IS EXPECTED TO
StephenPetranek_2002@654.14:662.93 THE RAIN FOREST COLLAPSES AS AN ECOSYSTEM THERE'S REALLY A TREE LIKE THAT OUT THERE THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT COMES TO AND WHEN THAT ECOSYSTEM COLLAPSES
StephenPetranek_2002@663.18:670.23 A MAJOR ECOSYSTEM WITH IT LIKE OUR ATMOSPHERE SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THIS WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS
StephenPetranek_2002@671.10:679.46 THERE IS SOME MODELING OF ECOSYSTEMS GOING ON NOW THE PROBLEM WITH ECOSYSTEMS IS THAT WE UNDERSTAND THEM SO POORLY THAT
StephenPetranek_2002@679.61:688.09 WE DON'T KNOW THEY'RE REALLY IN TROUBLE UNTIL IT'S ALMOST TOO LATE WE NEED TO KNOW EARLIER THAT THEY'RE GETTING IN TROUBLE AND WE NEED TO
StephenPetranek_2002@688.66:700.03 BE ABLE TO PUMP POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS INTO MODELS AND WITH THE KIND OF COMPUTING POWER WE HAVE NOW THERE IS AS I SAY SOME OF THIS GOING ON BUT IT NEEDS MONEY NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION NEEDS TO SAY YOU KNOW
StephenPetranek_2002@700.73:710.20 ALMOST ALL THE MONEY THAT'S SPENT ON SCIENCE IN THIS COUNTRY COMES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND THEY GET TO PRIORITIZE YOU KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE AT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE
StephenPetranek_2002@710.69:718.95 THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THEY OUGHT TO BE THINKING MORE ABOUT SECONDLY WE NEED TO CREATE HUGE BIODIVERSITY RESERVES ON THE PLANET AND START MOVING THEM AROUND
StephenPetranek_2002@719.55:731.15 THERE'S BEEN AN EXPERIMENT FOR THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS ON THE GEORGES BANK OR THE GRAND BANKS OFF OF NEWFOUNDLAND IT'S A NO TAKE FISHING ZONE THEY CAN'T FISH THERE FOR A RADIUS OF TWO HUNDRED MILES AND AN AMAZING THING
StephenPetranek_2002@755.61:763.40 YOU ALL REMEMBER TED KACZYNSKI THE UNABOMBER ONE OF THE THINGS HE RAVED ABOUT WAS THAT A PARTICLE ACCELERATOR EXPERIMENT COULD GO HAYWIRE
StephenPetranek_2002@763.82:773.97 AND SET OFF A CHAIN REACTION THAT WOULD DESTROY THE WORLD A LOT OF VERY SOBER MINDED PHYSICISTS BELIEVE IT OR NOT HAVE HAD EXACTLY THE SAME THOUGHT THIS SPRING THERE'S A COLLIDER AT
StephenPetranek_2002@791.17:791.43 RIGHT
StephenPetranek_2002@794.27:798.14 OTHER COLLIDER EXPERIMENTS THERE'S ONE THAT'S GONNA TAKE PLACE NEXT SUMMER AT CERN
StephenPetranek_2002@798.42:805.95 HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF CREATING SOMETHING CALLED STRANGELETS WHICH ARE KIND OF LIKE ANTIMATTER WHENEVER THEY HIT OTHER MATTER THEY DESTROY IT AND
StephenPetranek_2002@835.22:838.78 WE NEED THE ADVICE OF PARTICLE PHYSICISTS TO TALK ABOUT PARTICLE PHYSICS
StephenPetranek_2002@839.96:847.84 BUT WE NEED SOME OUTSIDE THINKING AND WATCHDOGGING OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THESE EXPERIMENTS
StephenPetranek_2002@848.46:858.38 SECONDLY WE HAVE A NATURAL LABORATORY SURROUNDING THE EARTH WE HAVE AN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD AROUND THE EARTH AND IT'S CONSTANTLY BOMBARDED BY HIGH ENERGY PARTICLES LIKE PROTONS
StephenPetranek_2002@858.74:866.94 AND WE DON'T IN MY OPINION WE DON'T SPEND ENOUGH TIME LOOKING AT THAT NATURAL LABORATORY AND FIGURING OUT FIRST
StephenPetranek_2002@877.60:883.68 THAT CREATES ITS OWN PESTICIDE TO KILL A CORN BORER YOU MAY OF HEARD OF IT HEARD IT CALLED STARLING
StephenPetranek_2002@909.97:916.77 THEY FOUND BT CORN GENES IN WILD CORN PLANTS NOW CORN ORIGINATED WE THINK IN MEXICO
StephenPetranek_2002@917.86:924.16 THIS IS THE GENETIC BIODIVERSITY STOREHOUSE OF CORN THIS BRINGS BACK A
StephenPetranek_2002@925.18:935.81 GONE AWAY RECENTLY THAT SUPERWEEDS AND SUPERPESTS COULD SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD FROM BIOTECHNOLOGY THAT LITERALLY COULD DESTROY THE WORLD 'S FOOD
StephenPetranek_2002@938.40:938.78 SO
StephenPetranek_2002@950.79:957.53 THE STARLING DISASTER HAPPENED THERE WAS A BATTLE BETWEEN THE EPA AND THE FDA OVER WHO REALLY HAD AUTHORITY AND OVER WHAT PARTS
StephenPetranek_2002@958.74:963.51 IT STRAIGHTENED OUT FOR MONTHS THAT'S KIND OF CRAZY NUMBER FIVE
StephenPetranek_2002@964.35:976.21 ONE OF MY FAVORITES REVERSAL OF THE EARTH 'S MAGNETIC FIELD BELIEVE IT OR NOT THIS HAPPENS EVERY FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AND HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES IN OUR HISTORY NORTH POLE GOES TO THE SOUTH SOUTH POLE GOES TO THE NORTH AND VICE VERSA
StephenPetranek_2002@989.60:996.64 COME STREAMING AT US FROM THE SUN THAT THIS FIELD PROTECTS US FROM ARE WELL BASICALLY
StephenPetranek_2002@997.73:997.89 WE'RE
StephenPetranek_2002@1008.47:1009.67 SO WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THIS
StephenPetranek_2002@1010.33:1012.01 OH BY THE WAY WE'RE OVERDUE
StephenPetranek_2002@1013.42:1023.26 THOUSAND YEARS SINCE THIS HAPPENED SO IT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO OH AND HERE 'S ONE OTHER THING SCIENTISTS THINK NOW OUR MAGNETIC FIELD MAY BE
StephenPetranek_2002@1028.66:1040.55 MAYBE WE'RE IN THE THROES OF IT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW HEALTHY THE EARTH IS IS THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE GOOD WEATHER DATA FROM SIXTY YEARS AGO MUCH LESS DATA
StephenPetranek_2002@1042.10:1044.72 THINGS LIKE THE OZONE LAYER SO
StephenPetranek_2002@1045.21:1052.19 THERE'S A FAIRLY SIMPLE SOLUTION TO THIS THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF CHEAP ROCKETRY THAT'S GONNA COME ONLINE IN ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN YEARS
StephenPetranek_2002@1052.56:1062.24 GETS US INTO THE LOW ATMOSPHERE VERY CHEAPLY YOU KNOW WE CAN MAKE OZONE FROM CAR TAILPIPES IT'S NOT HARD IT'S JUST THREE OXYGEN ATOMS
StephenPetranek_2002@1063.37:1075.69 BROUGHT THE ENTIRE OZONE LAYER DOWN TO THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IT WOULD BE THE THICKNESS OF TWO PENNIES AT FOURTEEN POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH YOU DON'T NEED THAT MUCH UP THERE WE NEED TO LEARN HOW TO REPAIR AND REPLENISH THE EARTH 'S OZONE LAYER
StephenPetranek_2002@1094.22:1103.66 WELL PROTECTING US FROM THIS OCCASIONALLY WE GET A FLARE FROM THE SUN THAT CAUSES HAVOC WITH COMMUNICATIONS AND SO FORTH AND ELECTRICITY
StephenPetranek_2002@1104.21:1112.70 BUT THE ALARMING THING IS THAT ASTRONOMERS RECENTLY HAVE BEEN STUDYING STARS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OUR SUN AND THEY'VE FOUND THAT A NUMBER OF THEM WHEN THEY'RE ABOUT THE AGE OF OUR SUN
StephenPetranek_2002@1114.10:1120.45 BY A FACTOR OF AS MUCH AS TWENTY DOESN'T LAST FOR VERY LONG AND THEY THINK THESE ARE SUPERFLARES MILLIONS OF TIMES MORE
StephenPetranek_2002@1121.38:1122.98 FLARES WE'VE HAD FROM OUR SUN SO
StephenPetranek_2002@1129.84:1133.47 THERE'S A FLIP SIDE TO IT IN STUDYING STARS LIKE OUR SUN WE'VE FOUND THAT
StephenPetranek_2002@1133.54:1135.83 THEY GO THROUGH PERIODS OF DIMINISHMENT WHEN
StephenPetranek_2002@1136.77:1147.05 TOTAL AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT'S EXPELLED FROM THEM GOES DOWN BY MAYBE ONE PERCENT ONE PERCENT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT BUT IT WOULD CAUSE ONE HELL OF AN ICE AGE HERE SO WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THIS
StephenPetranek_2002@1153.25:1161.60 NINETY THREE THIS IS ROCKET SCIENCE BUT IT'S NOT HARD ROCKET SCIENCE EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO MAKE AN ATMOSPHERE ON MARS AND
StephenPetranek_2002@1161.85:1168.88 TO MAKE A LIVABLE PLANET ON MARS IS PROBABLY THERE AND YOU JUST LITERALLY HAVE TO
StephenPetranek_2002@1169.53:1175.57 SEND LITTLE NUCLEAR FACTORIES UP THERE THAT GOBBLE UP THE IRON OXIDE ON THE SURFACE OF MARS AND SPIT OUT THE OXYGEN
StephenPetranek_2002@1175.69:1184.37 THE PROBLEM IS IT TAKES THREE HUNDRED YEARS TO TERRAFORM MARS MINIMUM REALLY MORE LIKE FIVE HUNDRED YEARS TO DO IT RIGHT THERE'S NO REASON WHY
StephenPetranek_2002@1193.85:1202.19 A NEW GLOBAL EPIDEMIC PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AT WAR WITH GERMS EVER SINCE THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE AND FROM TIME TO TIME THE GERMS SURE GET THE UPPER HAND IN
StephenPetranek_2002@1204.05:1215.18 WE HAD A FLU EPIDEMIC IN THE UNITED STATES THAT KILLED TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT WAS BACK WHEN THE POPULATION WAS AROUND ONE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE THE BUBONIC PLAGUE IN EUROPE IN THE MIDDLE AGES KILLED ONE
StephenPetranek_2002@1216.79:1227.30 EUROPEANS AIDS IS COMING BACK EBOLA SEEMS TO BE REARING ITS HEAD WITH MUCH TOO MUCH FREQUENCY AND OLD DISEASES LIKE CHOLERA ARE BECOMING
StephenPetranek_2002@1230.18:1235.78 ALL LEARNED WHAT THE KIND OF PANIC THAT CAN OCCUR WHEN AN OLD DISEASE REARS ITS HEAD LIKE ANTHRAX
StephenPetranek_2002@1237.48:1243.58 THE WORST POSSIBILITY IS THAT A VERY SIMPLE GERM LIKE STAPH
StephenPetranek_2002@1243.85:1247.09 FOR WHICH WE HAVE ONE ANTIBIOTIC THAT STILL WORKS
StephenPetranek_2002@1248.45:1255.56 MUTATES AND WE KNOW STAPH CAN DO AMAZING THINGS A STAPH CELL CAN BE NEXT TO A MUSCLE CELL IN YOUR BODY AND BORROW GENES
StephenPetranek_2002@1256.23:1264.76 WHEN ANTIBIOTICS COME AND CHANGE AND MUTATE THE DANGER IS THAT SOME GERM LIKE STAPH WILL BE WILL MUTATE INTO SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY
StephenPetranek_2002@1266.11:1274.41 VERY CONTAGIOUS AND WILL SWEEP THROUGH POPULATIONS BEFORE WE CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT THAT'S HAPPENED BEFORE ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO
StephenPetranek_2002@1274.62:1284.40 THERE WAS A MASSIVE WAVE OF MAMMAL EXTINCTIONS IN THE AMERICAS AND THAT IS THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN A VIRULENT DISEASE SO WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT IT IS NUTS WE
StephenPetranek_2002@1288.70:1289.25 EVERY
StephenPetranek_2002@1295.51:1299.56 FOR YOU IT'S ALL FARMED YOU KNOW YOU GOTTA ASK WHEN YOU GO TO A RESTAURANT IF IT'S A WILD FISH
StephenPetranek_2002@1319.86:1325.33 DISEASE IN THE UNITED STATES WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO COPE WITH IT NOW THERE IS MONEY
StephenPetranek_2002@1325.65:1334.84 IN THE FEDERAL BUDGET NEXT YEAR TO BUILD UP THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE BUT I DON'T THINK TO ANY EXTENT THAT IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE NUMBER TWO MY FAVORITE
StephenPetranek_2002@1368.21:1379.25 AND THESE STARS HAVE COMPRESSED DOWN TO MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE FIFTEEN MILES WIDE AND THEY ARE BLACK HOLES AND THEY ARE GOBBLING UP EVERYTHING AROUND THEM INCLUDING LIGHT WHICH IS WHY WE CAN'T SEE THEM
StephenPetranek_2002@1380.48:1384.87 MOST OF THEM SHOULD BE IN ORBIT AROUND SOMETHING BUT GALAXIES ARE VERY VIOLENT
StephenPetranek_2002@1385.16:1394.00 PLACES AND THINGS CAN BE SPUN OUT OF ORBIT ALSO SPACE IS INCREDIBLY VAST SO EVEN IF YOU FLUNG A MILLION OF THESE THINGS
StephenPetranek_2002@1395.02:1404.70 THE CHANCES THAT ONE WOULD ACTUALLY HIT US IS FAIRLY REMOTE BUT IT ONLY HAS TO GET CLOSE ABOUT A BILLION MILES AWAY
StephenPetranek_2002@1406.66:1414.67 ABOUT A BILLION MILES AWAY HERE 'S WHAT HAPPENS TO EARTH 'S ORBIT IT BECOMES ELLIPTICAL INSTEAD OF CIRCULAR AND FOR THREE MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR
StephenPetranek_2002@1415.03:1418.93 THE SURFACE TEMPERATURES GO UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOR THREE MONTHS
StephenPetranek_2002@1436.84:1439.81 AGAIN WE GOTTA THINK ABOUT BEING A COLONIZING RACE
StephenPetranek_2002@1440.68:1442.13 AND FINALLY NUMBER ONE
StephenPetranek_2002@1445.56:1447.80 A REALLY BIG ASTEROID HEADS FOR
StephenPetranek_2002@1459.43:1466.08 PIECE OF A COMET EXPLODED OVER SIBERIA AND FLATTENED FORESTS FOR MAYBE ONE HUNDRED MILES IT HAD THE EFFECT OF
StephenPetranek_2002@1479.47:1487.65 FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND MILES AWAY FROM EARTH NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT RIGHT IT PASSED DIRECTLY THROUGH EARTH 'S ORBIT WE WERE IN THAT THAT SPOT SIX HOURS
StephenPetranek_2002@1493.45:1500.31 A SMALL ASTEROID SAY A HALF MILE WIDE WOULD TOUCH OFF FIRESTORMS FOLLOWED BY SEVERE GLOBAL COOLING FROM THE
StephenPetranek_2002@1503.37:1516.88 THING AN ASTEROID FIVE MILES WIDE CAUSES MAJOR EXTINCTIONS WE THINK THE ONE THAT GOT THE DINOSAURS WAS ABOUT FIVE MILES WIDE WHERE ARE THEY THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THE KUIPER BELT WHICH SOME PEOPLE THINK PLUTO 'S NOT A PLANET
StephenPetranek_2002@1527.08:1534.33 BALLS OF ICE AND ROCK COMETS REALLY OUT THERE THAT ARE FIFTY MILES IN DIAMETER OR MORE AND THEY REGULARLY
StephenPetranek_2002@1534.60:1548.69 TAKE A LITTLE SPIN IN TOWARDS THE SUN AND PASS REASONABLY CLOSE TO US OF MORE CONCERN I THINK IS THE ASTEROIDS THAT EXIST BETWEEN MARS AND JUPITER
StephenPetranek_2002@1549.90:1556.61 THE FOLKS AT THE SLOAN DIGITAL SKY SURVEY TOLD US LAST FALL THEY'RE MAKING THE FIRST MAP OF THE UNIVERSE THREE DIMENSIONAL MAP OF THE UNIVERSE
StephenPetranek_2002@1567.73:1572.26 SO YOU SAY YEAH WELL WHAT ARE REALLY THE CHANCES OF THIS
StephenPetranek_2002@1576.11:1584.42 THIS IS A CHART THAT DOCTOR CLARK CHAPMAN AT THE SOUTHWESTERN RESEARCH INSTITUTE PRESENTED TO CONGRESS A FEW YEARS AGO YOU'LL
StephenPetranek_2002@1584.99:1593.28 THE CHANCE OF AN ASTEROID SLASH COMET IMPACT KILLING YOU IS ABOUT ONE IN TWENTY THOUSAND ACCORDING TO THE WORK THEY'VE DONE NOW LOOK AT THE ONE RIGHT BELOW THAT
StephenPetranek_2002@1594.04:1601.29 PASSENGER AIRCRAFT CRASH ONE IN TWENTY THOUSAND WE SPEND AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY TRYING TO BE
StephenPetranek_2002@1603.03:1606.30 AND WE'RE NOT SPENDING HARDLY ANYTHING ON THIS
StephenPetranek_2002@1606.47:1615.88 AND YET THIS IS COMPLETELY PREVENTABLE WE FINALLY HAVE JUST IN THE LAST YEAR THE TECHNOLOGY TO STOP THIS COLD COULD WE HAVE THE SOLUTIONS
StephenPetranek_2002@1617.40:1627.76 SPENDING THREE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THREE MILLION BUCKS THAT IS LIKE POCKET CHANGE TO SEARCH FOR ASTEROIDS BECAUSE WE CAN ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT EVERY ASTEROID THAT'S OUT THERE
StephenPetranek_2002@1628.15:1639.68 IT MIGHT HIT EARTH AND WHEN IT MIGHT HIT EARTH AND THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THAT BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE THEM TEN YEARS AT SPENDING THREE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND EVEN THEN THEY CLAIM THEY'LL ONLY HAVE ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF
StephenPetranek_2002@1648.26:1656.15 BUT WE WOULD HAVE LOTS OF TIME IF WE SEE IT COMING WE REALLY NEED A DEDICATED OBSERVATORY YOU'LL NOTICE THAT A LOT OF COMETS ARE NAMED AFTER
StephenPetranek_2002@1657.38:1667.39 AMATEUR ASTRONOMERS THAT'S BECAUSE NOBODY 'S LOOKING FOR THEM EXCEPT AMATEURS WE NEED A DEDICATED OBSERVATORY THAT LOOKS FOR COMETS PART TWO OF THE SOLUTIONS
StephenPetranek_2002@1668.08:1679.31 WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BLOW UP AN ASTEROID OR ALTER ITS TRAJECTORY NOW A YEAR AGO WE DID AN AMAZING THING WE SENT A PROBE OUT TO THIS ASTEROID BELT CALLED NEAR NEAR EARTH ASTEROID RENDEZVOUS
StephenPetranek_2002@1679.86:1686.60 AND THESE GUYS ORBITED A THIRTY OR NO ABOUT A TWENTY TWO MILE LONG ASTEROID CALLED
StephenPetranek_2002@1719.89:1727.32 BUT WE CAN LEARN TO LAND ON THESE ASTEROIDS THAT HAVE OUR NAME ON THEM AND PUT SOMETHING LIKE A SMALL ION PROPULSION
StephenPetranek_2002@1728.19:1740.03 MOTOR ON IT WHICH WOULD GENTLY SLOWLY AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME PUSH IT INTO A DIFFERENT TRAJECTORY WHICH IF WE'VE DONE OUR MATH RIGHT WOULD KEEP IT FROM HITTING EARTH THIS IS JUST A MATTER OF FINDING EM GOING
StephenPetranek_2002@1740.57:1744.77 AND DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT I KNOW YOUR HEAD IS SPINNING FROM ALL THIS STUFF
StephenPetranek_2002@1745.93:1746.30 SO
StephenPetranek_2002@1749.05:1751.74 I THINK TO REMEMBER IS SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH WE DON'T WANNA GET
StephenPetranek_2002@1752.05:1762.75 CAUGHT FLAT FOOTED AGAIN WE KNOW ABOUT THIS STUFF SCIENCE HAS THE POWER TO PREDICT THE FUTURE IN MANY CASES NOW KNOWLEDGE IS POWER THE WORST THING WE CAN DO
StephenPetranek_2002@1764.21:1767.36 SAY JEEZ I GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT AN
