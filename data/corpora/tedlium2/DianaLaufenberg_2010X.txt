DianaLaufenberg_2010X@16.34:29.14 I HAVE BEEN TEACHING FOR A LONG TIME AND IN DOING SO HAVE ACQUIRED A BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT KIDS AND LEARNING THAT I REALLY WISH MORE PEOPLE WOULD UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF STUDENTS
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@56.60:67.58 IN THE ONLY PORTABLE MEMORY HE HAS WHICH IS INSIDE HIS OWN HEAD AND TAKE IT WITH HIM BECAUSE THAT IS HOW INFORMATION WAS BEING TRANSPORTED FROM TEACHER TO STUDENT AND THEN USED IN THE WORLD
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@68.09:80.96 WHEN I WAS A KID WE HAD A SET OF ENCYCLOPEDIAS AT MY HOUSE IT WAS PURCHASED THE YEAR I WAS BORN AND IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE TO WAIT TO GO TO THE LIBRARY TO GET TO THE INFORMATION THE INFORMATION WAS INSIDE MY HOUSE AND IT WAS
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@82.45:94.39 THIS WAS DIFFERENT THAN EITHER GENERATION HAD EXPERIENCED BEFORE AND IT CHANGED THE WAY I INTERACTED WITH INFORMATION EVEN AT JUST A SMALL LEVEL BUT THE INFORMATION WAS CLOSER TO ME I COULD GET ACCESS TO IT
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@95.25:108.57 IN THE TIME THAT PASSES BETWEEN WHEN I WAS A KID IN HIGH SCHOOL AND WHEN I STARTED TEACHING WE REALLY SEE THE ADVENT OF THE INTERNET RIGHT ABOUT THE TIME THE INTERNET GETS GOING AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL I TAKE OFF FROM WISCONSIN AND MOVE
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@109.00:119.64 TO KANSAS SMALL TOWN KANSAS WHERE I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TEACH IN A LOVELY SMALL TOWN RURAL KANSAS SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE I WAS TEACHING MY FAVORITE SUBJECT AMERICAN GOVERNMENT
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@120.28:131.09 MY FIRST YEAR SUPER GUNG HO GOING TO TEACH AMERICAN GOVERNMENT LOVED POLITICAL SYSTEM KIDS IN THE TWELFTH GRADE NOT EXACTLY ALL THAT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@139.13:146.96 FOR THEMSELVES I DIDN'T TELL THEM WHAT TO DO OR HOW TO DO IT I POSED A PROBLEM IN FRONT OF THEM WHICH WAS TO PUT ON AN ELECTION FORUM FOR THEIR OWN COMMUNITY
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@147.31:159.46 THEY PRODUCED FLIERS THEY CALLED OFFICES THEY CHECKED SCHEDULES THEY WERE MEETING WITH SECRETARIES THEY PRODUCED AN ELECTION FORUM BOOKLET FOR THE ENTIRE TOWN TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR CANDIDATES THEY INVITED EVERYONE INTO THE SCHOOL FOR AN EVENING OF CONVERSATION ABOUT
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@159.96:173.01 GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS AND WHETHER OR NOT THE STREETS WERE DONE WELL AND REALLY HAD THIS ROBUST EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING THE OLDER TEACHERS MORE EXPERIENCED LOOKED AT ME AND WENT OH THERE SHE IS THAT'S SO CUTE SHE'S TRYING TO GET THAT
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@176.38:184.40 IN FOR BUT I KNEW THAT THE KIDS WOULD SHOW UP AND I BELIEVED IT AND I TOLD THEM EVERY WEEK WHAT I EXPECTED OUT OF THEM
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@184.83:197.07 AND THAT NIGHT ALL NINETY KIDS DRESSED APPROPRIATELY DOING THEIR JOB OWNING IT I HAD TO JUST SIT AND WATCH IT WAS THEIRS IT WAS EXPERIENTIAL IT WAS AUTHENTIC IT MEANT SOMETHING TO THEM AND THEY WILL STEP UP
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@197.49:205.03 FROM KANSAS I MOVED ON TO LOVELY ARIZONA WHERE I TAUGHT IN FLAGSTAFF FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THIS TIME WITH MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@217.52:230.38 THIS POSITION I FOUND MYSELF IN IN ARIZONA WAS I HAD THIS REALLY EXTRAORDINARILY ECLECTIC GROUP OF KIDS TO WORK WITH IN A TRULY PUBLIC SCHOOL AND WE GOT TO HAVE THESE MOMENTS WHERE WE WOULD GET THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND ONE OPPORTUNITY WAS
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@230.93:243.74 WE GOT TO GO AND MEET PAUL RUSESABAGINA WHICH IS THE GENTLEMAN THAT THE MOVIE HOTEL RWANDA IS BASED AFTER AND HE WAS GOING TO SPEAK AT THE HIGH SCHOOL NEXT DOOR TO US WE COULD WALK THERE WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO PAY FOR THE BUSES THERE WAS NO EXPENSE COST
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@251.37:259.61 IS RESPONSIBLE AND RESPECTFUL AND THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT AND SO WE CHOSE TO LOOK AT PAUL RUSESABAGINA AS AN EXAMPLE OF A GENTLEMAN WHO
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@280.23:289.69 IT WAS THE MOST AWESOME MOMENT OF REVELATION THAT WHEN YOU ASK KIDS TO USE THEIR OWN VOICE AND ASK THEM TO SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@290.27:304.75 WHAT THEY'RE WILLING TO SHARE THE LAST QUESTION OF THE ASSIGNMENT IS HOW DO YOU PLAN TO USE YOUR LIFE TO POSITIVELY IMPACT OTHER PEOPLE THE THINGS THAT KIDS WILL SAY WHEN YOU ASK THEM AND TAKE THE TIME TO LISTEN IS EXTRAORDINARY
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@305.76:311.19 FAST FORWARD TO PENNSYLVANIA WHERE I FIND MYSELF TODAY I TEACH AT THE SCIENCE LEADERSHIP ACADEMY
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@321.63:335.21 I MOVED THERE PRIMARILY TO BE PART OF A LEARNING ENVIRONMENT THAT VALIDATED THE WAY THAT I KNEW THAT KIDS LEARNED AND THAT REALLY WANTED TO INVESTIGATE WHAT WAS POSSIBLE WHEN YOU ARE WILLING TO LET GO OF SOME OF THE PARADIGMS OF THE PAST
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@335.52:343.92 OF INFORMATION SCARCITY WHEN MY GRANDMOTHER WAS IN SCHOOL AND WHEN MY FATHER WAS IN SCHOOL AND EVEN WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL AND TO A MOMENT WHEN WE HAVE INFORMATION SURPLUS
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@344.43:350.80 SO WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN THE INFORMATION IS ALL AROUND YOU WHY DO YOU HAVE KIDS COME TO SCHOOL IF THEY NO LONGER HAVE TO COME THERE TO GET THE INFORMATION
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@374.44:386.78 WE DEAL RIGHT NOW IN THE EDUCATIONAL LANDSCAPE WITH AN INFATUATION WITH THE CULTURE OF ONE RIGHT ANSWER THAT CAN BE PROPERLY BUBBLED ON THE AVERAGE MULTIPLE CHOICE TEST AND I AM HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU IT IS NOT LEARNING
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@387.55:396.86 THAT IS THE ABSOLUTE WRONG THING TO ASK TO TELL KIDS TO NEVER BE WRONG TO ASK THEM TO ALWAYS HAVE THE RIGHT ANSWER DOESN'T ALLOW THEM TO LEARN
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@398.32:405.39 SO WE DID THIS PROJECT AND THIS IS ONE OF THE ARTIFACTS OF THE PROJECT I ALMOST NEVER SHOW THEM OFF BECAUSE OF THE ISSUE OF THE IDEA OF FAILURE
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@417.80:429.06 IN A LOT OF MASS MEDIA AND TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WERE THE INTERESTING COMPONENTS OF IT AND PRODUCE ONE FOR THEMSELVES FROM A DIFFERENT MAN MADE DISASTER FROM AMERICAN HISTORY AND THEY HAD CERTAIN CRITERIA TO DO IT
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@442.61:454.28 BUT I GAVE THEM THE ROOM TO JUST DO THE THING GO CREATE GO FIGURE IT OUT LET 'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO AND THE STUDENT THAT PERSISTENTLY TURNS OUT THE BEST VISUAL PRODUCT DID NOT
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@470.01:476.02 GOOD COLOR AND THERE'S SOME AND THEY WENT THROUGH ALL THAT WE PROCESSED OUT LOUD AND I SAID GO READ IT AND THEY'RE LIKE
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@495.48:502.53 LEARN FROM AND WHEN WE DO ANOTHER ROUND OF THIS IN MY CLASS THIS YEAR THEY WILL DO BETTER THIS TIME BECAUSE LEARNING
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@503.10:510.93 HAS TO INCLUDE AN AMOUNT OF FAILURE BECAUSE FAILURE IS INSTRUCTIONAL IN THE PROCESS THERE ARE
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@511.44:523.80 A MILLION PICTURES THAT I COULD CLICK THROUGH HERE AND HAD TO CHOOSE CAREFULLY THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES OF STUDENTS LEARNING OF WHAT LEARNING CAN LOOK LIKE IN A LANDSCAPE WHERE WE LET GO OF THE IDEA
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@524.21:531.88 THAT KIDS HAVE TO COME TO SCHOOL TO GET THE INFORMATION BUT INSTEAD ASK THEM WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH IT ASK THEM REALLY INTERESTING QUESTIONS THEY WILL NOT DISAPPOINT
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@532.39:538.97 ASK THEM TO GO TO PLACES TO SEE THINGS FOR THEMSELVES TO ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE THE LEARNING TO PLAY
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@540.51:541.57 TO INQUIRE
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@542.29:550.54 THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PHOTOS BECAUSE THIS WAS TAKEN ON TUESDAY WHEN I ASKED THE STUDENTS TO GO TO THE POLLS THIS IS ROBBIE AND THIS WAS HIS FIRST DAY OF VOTING
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@550.77:557.53 AND HE WANTED TO SHARE THAT WITH EVERYBODY AND DO THAT BUT THIS IS LEARNING TOO BECAUSE WE ASKED THEM TO GO OUT INTO REAL SPACES
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@560.57:567.08 THE MAIN POINT IS THAT IF WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT EDUCATION AS IF
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@567.51:576.78 IT'S ABOUT COMING TO SCHOOL TO GET THE INFORMATION AND NOT ABOUT EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING EMPOWERING STUDENT VOICE AND EMBRACING FAILURE WE'RE MISSING THE MARK
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@577.13:585.16 AND EVERYTHING THAT EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT TODAY ISN'T POSSIBLE IF WE KEEP HAVING AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT VALUE THESE QUALITIES
DianaLaufenberg_2010X@585.46:593.21 BECAUSE WE WON 'T GET THERE WITH A STANDARDIZED TEST AND WE WON 'T GET THERE WITH A CULTURE OF ONE RIGHT ANSWER WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS BETTER AND IT'S TIME TO DO BETTER
