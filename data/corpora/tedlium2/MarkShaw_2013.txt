MarkShaw_2013 WHAT I HAVE HERE IS A CINDER BLOCK THAT WE 'VE COATED HALF WITH A NANOTECHNOLOGY SPRAY THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO ALMOST ANY MATERIAL
MarkShaw_2013 IT 'S CALLED ULTRA EVER DRY
MarkShaw_2013 AND WHEN YOU APPLY IT TO ANY MATERIAL IT TURNS INTO A SUPERHYDROPHOBIC SHIELD
MarkShaw_2013 SO THIS IS A CINDER BLOCK UNCOATED
MarkShaw_2013 AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT 'S POROUS IT ABSORBS WATER
MarkShaw_2013 SUPERHYDROPHOBIC IS HOW WE MEASURE A DROP OF WATER ON A SURFACE THE ROUNDER IT IS THE MORE HYDROPHOBIC IT IS AND IF IT 'S REALLY ROUND IT 'S SUPERHYDROPHOBIC A FRESHLY WAXED CAR THE WATER MOLECULES SLUMP
MarkShaw_2013 TO ABOUT NINETY DEGREES
MarkShaw_2013 A WINDSHIELD COATING IS GOING TO GIVE YOU ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TEN DEGREES BUT WHAT YOU 'RE SEEING HERE IS ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TO ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DEGREES AND ANYTHING OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY IS SUPERHYDROPHOBIC SO AS PART OF THE DEMONSTRATION WHAT I HAVE IS A PAIR OF GLOVES
MarkShaw_2013 AND WE 'VE COATED ONE OF THE GLOVES
MarkShaw_2013 WITH THE NANOTECHNOLOGY COATING AND LET 'S SEE IF YOU CAN TELL WHICH ONE AND I 'LL GIVE YOU A HINT
MarkShaw_2013 THE WAY YOU MEASURE NANOTECHNOLOGY IS IN NANOMETERS AND ONE NANOMETER IS A BILLIONTH OF A METER AND TO PUT SOME SCALE TO THAT IF YOU HAD A NANOPARTICLE THAT WAS ONE NANOMETER THICK AND YOU PUT IT SIDE BY SIDE AND YOU HAD FIFTY THOUSAND OF THEM
MarkShaw_2013 YOU 'D BE THE WIDTH OF A HUMAN HAIR
MarkShaw_2013 SO VERY SMALL BUT VERY USEFUL AND IT 'S NOT JUST WATER THAT THIS WORKS WITH IT 'S A LOT OF WATER BASED MATERIALS LIKE CONCRETE WATER BASED PAINT MUD AND ALSO SOME REFINED OILS AS WELL
MarkShaw_2013 YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE
MarkShaw_2013 MOVING ONTO THE NEXT DEMONSTRATION WE 'VE TAKEN A PANE OF GLASS AND WE 'VE COATED THE OUTSIDE OF IT WE 'VE FRAMED IT WITH THE NANOTECHNOLOGY COATING AND WE 'RE GOING TO POUR THIS GREEN TINTED WATER INSIDE THE MIDDLE
MarkShaw_2013 AND YOU 'RE GOING TO SEE IT 'S GOING TO SPREAD OUT ON GLASS LIKE YOU 'D NORMALLY THINK IT WOULD EXCEPT WHEN IT HITS THE COATING
MarkShaw_2013 AND THOSE SPACES ALONG WITH THE NANOPARTICLES REACH UP AND GRAB THE AIR MOLECULES AND COVER THE SURFACE WITH AIR IT 'S AN UMBRELLA OF AIR ALL ACROSS IT
MarkShaw_2013 AND THAT LAYER OF AIR IS WHAT THE WATER HITS THE MUD HITS THE CONCRETE HITS AND IT GLIDES RIGHT OFF
MarkShaw_2013 SO IF I PUT THIS INSIDE THIS WATER HERE YOU CAN SEE A SILVER REFLECTIVE COATING AROUND IT
MarkShaw_2013 I MEAN MANY OF YOU RIGHT NOW ARE PROBABLY GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD EVERYONE THAT SEES THIS GETS EXCITED AND SAYS OH I COULD USE IT FOR THIS AND THIS AND THIS THE APPLICATIONS IN A GENERAL SENSE COULD BE ANYTHING THAT 'S ANTI WETTING WE 'VE CERTAINLY SEEN THAT TODAY
MarkShaw_2013 IT COULD BE ANYTHING THAT 'S ANTI ICING BECAUSE IF YOU DON 'T HAVE WATER YOU DON 'T HAVE ICE IT COULD BE ANTI CORROSION
MarkShaw_2013 NO WATER NO CORROSION IT COULD BE ANTI BACTERIAL
MarkShaw_2013 WITHOUT WATER THE BACTERIA WON 'T SURVIVE
MarkShaw_2013 AND IT COULD BE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE SELF CLEANING AS WELL
MarkShaw_2013 SO IMAGINE HOW SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HELP REVOLUTIONIZE YOUR FIELD OF WORK
