MichaelArcher_2013X@13.15:23.19 DO WANT TO TEST THIS QUESTION WE 'RE ALL INTERESTED IN DOES EXTINCTION HAVE TO BE FOREVER I 'M FOCUSED ON TWO PROJECTS I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT ONE IS THE THYLACINE PROJECT
MichaelArcher_2013X@23.2:42.89 THE OTHER ONE IS THE LAZARUS PROJECT AND THAT 'S FOCUSED ON THE GASTRIC BROODING FROG AND IT WOULD BE A FAIR QUESTION TO ASK WELL WHY HAVE WE FOCUSED ON THESE TWO ANIMALS WELL POINT NUMBER ONE EACH OF THEM REPRESENTS A UNIQUE FAMILY OF ITS OWN WE 'VE LOST A WHOLE FAMILY THAT 'S A BIG CHUNK OF THE GLOBAL GENOME GONE I 'D LIKE IT BACK
MichaelArcher_2013X@42.89:54.12 THE SECOND REASON IS THAT WE KILLED THESE THINGS IN THE CASE OF THE THYLACINE REGRETTABLY WE SHOT EVERY ONE THAT WE SAW WE SLAUGHTERED THEM
MichaelArcher_2013X@54.12:70.53 IN THE CASE OF THE GASTRIC BROODING FROG WE MAY HAVE FUNGICIDED IT TO DEATH THERE 'S A DREADFUL FUNGUS THAT 'S SORT OF MOVING THROUGH THE WORLD THAT 'S CALLED THE CHYTRID FUNGUS AND IT 'S NAILING FROGS ALL OVER THE WORLD WE THINK THAT 'S PROBABLY WHAT GOT THIS FROG AND HUMANS ARE SPREADING THIS FUNGUS
MichaelArcher_2013X@70.53:79.05 AND THIS INTRODUCES A VERY IMPORTANT ETHICAL POINT AND I THINK YOU WILL HAVE HEARD THIS MANY TIMES WHEN THIS TOPIC COMES UP WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT
MichaelArcher_2013X@101.57:107.17 UNLIKE A NORMAL FROG WHICH LAYS ITS EGGS IN THE WATER AND GOES AWAY AND WISHES ITS FROGLETS WELL
MichaelArcher_2013X@107.17:114.3 THIS FROG SWALLOWED ITS FERTILIZED EGGS SWALLOWED THEM INTO THE STOMACH WHERE IT SHOULD BE HAVING FOOD
MichaelArcher_2013X@114.3:118.91 DIDN 'T DIGEST THE EGGS AND TURNED ITS STOMACH INTO A UTERUS
MichaelArcher_2013X@118.91:127.99 IN THE STOMACH THE EGGS WENT ON TO DEVELOP INTO TADPOLES AND IN THE STOMACH THE TADPOLES WENT ON TO DEVELOP INTO FROGS AND THEY GREW IN THE STOMACH
MichaelArcher_2013X@127.99:140.58 UNTIL EVENTUALLY THE POOR OLD FROG WAS AT RISK OF BURSTING APART IT HAS A LITTLE COUGH AND A HICCUP AND OUT COMES SPRAYS OF LITTLE FROGS NOW WHEN BIOLOGISTS SAW THIS THEY WERE AGOG THEY THOUGHT THIS IS INCREDIBLE
MichaelArcher_2013X@140.73:159.41 NO ANIMAL LET ALONE A FROG HAS BEEN KNOWN TO DO THIS TO CHANGE ONE ORGAN IN THE BODY INTO ANOTHER AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THE MEDICAL WORLD WENT NUTS OVER THIS AS WELL IF WE COULD UNDERSTAND HOW THAT FROG IS MANAGING THE WAY ITS TUMMY WORKS IS THERE INFORMATION HERE THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND OR COULD USEFULLY USE
MichaelArcher_2013X@159.41:164.34 TO HELP OURSELVES NOW I 'M NOT SUGGESTING WE WANT TO RAISE OUR BABIES IN OUR STOMACH
MichaelArcher_2013X@164.34:173.37 BUT I AM SUGGESTING IT 'S POSSIBLE WE MIGHT WANT TO MANAGE GASTRIC SECRETION IN THE GUT AND JUST AS EVERYBODY GOT EXCITED ABOUT IT BANG IT WAS EXTINCT
MichaelArcher_2013X@173.37:182.12 I CALLED UP MY FRIEND PROFESSOR MIKE TYLER IN THE UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE HE WAS THE LAST PERSON WHO HAD THIS FROG A COLONY OF THESE THINGS IN HIS LAB
MichaelArcher_2013X@182.12:200.59 AND I SAID MIKE BY ANY CHANCE THIS WAS THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS AGO BY ANY CHANCE HAD YOU KEPT ANY FROZEN TISSUE OF THIS FROG AND HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND HE WENT TO HIS DEEP FREEZER MINUS TWENTY DEGREES CENTIGRADE AND HE POURED THROUGH EVERYTHING IN THE FREEZER AND THERE IN THE BOTTOM WAS A JAR AND IT CONTAINED TISSUES OF THESE FROGS
MichaelArcher_2013X@200.59:208.98 THIS WAS VERY EXCITING BUT THERE WAS NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT THIS WOULD WORK BECAUSE THIS TISSUE HAD NOT HAD ANY ANTIFREEZE PUT IN IT
MichaelArcher_2013X@208.98:228.89 CRYOPROTECTANTS TO LOOK AFTER IT WHEN IT WAS FROZEN AND NORMALLY WHEN WATER FREEZES AS YOU KNOW IT EXPANDS AND THE SAME THING HAPPENS IN A CELL IF YOU FREEZE TISSUES THE WATER EXPANDS DAMAGES OR BURSTS THE CELL WALLS WELL WE LOOKED AT THE TISSUE UNDER THE MICROSCOPE IT ACTUALLY DIDN 'T LOOK BAD THE CELL WALLS LOOKED INTACT SO WE THOUGHT LET 'S GIVE IT A GO
MichaelArcher_2013X@228.89:233.45 WHAT WE DID IS SOMETHING CALLED SOMATIC CELL NUCLEAR TRANSPLANTATION
MichaelArcher_2013X@233.45:251.95 WE TOOK THE EGGS OF A RELATED SPECIES A LIVING FROG AND WE INACTIVATED THE NUCLEUS OF THE EGG WE USED ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION TO DO THAT AND THEN WE TOOK THE DEAD NUCLEUS FROM THE DEAD TISSUE OF THE EXTINCT FROG AND WE INSERTED THOSE NUCLEI INTO THAT EGG NOW BY RIGHTS
MichaelArcher_2013X@274.4:282.77 AND JUST LAST FEBRUARY THE LAST TIME WE DID THESE TRIALS I SAW A MIRACLE STARTING TO HAPPEN WHAT WE FOUND WAS
MichaelArcher_2013X@282.77:290.45 MOST OF THESE EGGS DIDN 'T WORK BUT THEN SUDDENLY ONE OF THEM BEGAN TO DIVIDE THAT WAS SO EXCITING AND THEN THE EGG DIVIDED AGAIN
MichaelArcher_2013X@290.45:300.19 AND THEN AGAIN AND PRETTY SOON WE HAD EARLY STAGE EMBRYOS WITH HUNDREDS OF CELLS FORMING THOSE WE EVEN DNA TESTED SOME OF THESE CELLS
MichaelArcher_2013X@300.19:312.03 AND THE DNA OF THE EXTINCT FROG IS IN THOSE CELLS SO WE 'RE VERY EXCITED THIS IS NOT A TADPOLE IT 'S NOT A FROG BUT IT 'S A LONG WAY ALONG THE JOURNEY TO PRODUCING OR BRINGING BACK
MichaelArcher_2013X@312.03:328.57 AN EXTINCT SPECIES AND THIS IS NEWS WE HAVEN 'T ANNOUNCED THIS PUBLICLY BEFORE WE 'RE EXCITED WE 'VE GOT TO GET PAST THIS POINT WE NOW WANT THIS BALL OF CELLS TO START TO GASTRULATE TO TURN IN SO THAT IT WILL PRODUCE THE OTHER TISSUES IT 'LL GO ON AND PRODUCE A TADPOLE AND THEN A FROG
MichaelArcher_2013X@328.57:333.53 WATCH THIS SPACE I THINK WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS FROG HOPPING GLAD TO BE BACK IN THE WORLD AGAIN
MichaelArcher_2013X@339.86:359.74 WE HAVEN 'T DONE IT YET BUT KEEP THOSE APPLAUSE READY THE SECOND PROJECT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IS THE THYLACINE PROJECT THE THYLACINE LOOKS A BIT TO MOST PEOPLE LIKE A DOG OR MAYBE LIKE A TIGER BECAUSE IT HAS STRIPES BUT IT 'S NOT RELATED TO ANY OF THOSE IT 'S A MARSUPIAL IT RAISED ITS YOUNG IN A POUCH LIKE A KOALA OR A KANGAROO WOULD DO
MichaelArcher_2013X@359.74:369.94 AND IT HAS A LONG HISTORY A LONG FASCINATING HISTORY THAT GOES BACK TWENTY FIVE MILLION YEARS BUT IT 'S ALSO A TRAGIC HISTORY
MichaelArcher_2013X@382.92:402.65 IN THOSE FOSSIL ROCKS ARE SOME AMAZING ANIMALS WE FOUND MARSUPIAL LIONS WE FOUND CARNIVOROUS KANGAROOS IT 'S NOT WHAT YOU USUALLY THINK ABOUT AS A KANGAROO BUT THESE ARE MEAT EATING KANGAROOS WE FOUND THE BIGGEST BIRD IN THE WORLD BIGGER THAN THAT THING THAT WAS IN MADAGASCAR AND IT TOO WAS A FLESH EATER IT WAS A GIANT WEIRD DUCK
MichaelArcher_2013X@422.51:430.87 BUT WHAT THEY WERE DROPPING ON WAS NOT ONLY OTHER WEIRD ANIMALS BUT ALSO THYLACINES THERE WERE FIVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THYLACINES IN THOSE ANCIENT FORESTS
MichaelArcher_2013X@463.31:466.59 BY TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO THEY HAD DISAPPEARED FROM NEW GUINEA
MichaelArcher_2013X@466.6:470.5 AND UNFORTUNATELY BY
MichaelArcher_2013X@470.5:484.81 FOUR THOUSAND YEARS AGO SOMEBODIES WE DON 'T KNOW WHO THIS WAS INTRODUCED DINGOES THIS IS A VERY ARCHAIC KIND OF A DOG INTO AUSTRALIA AND AS YOU CAN SEE DINGOES ARE VERY SIMILAR IN THEIR BODY FORM TO THYLACINES THAT SIMILARITY MEANT
MichaelArcher_2013X@484.81:491.69 THEY PROBABLY COMPETED THEY WERE EATING THE SAME KINDS OF FOODS IT 'S EVEN POSSIBLE THAT ABORIGINES WERE KEEPING SOME OF THESE DINGOES
MichaelArcher_2013X@491.69:504.68 AS PETS AND THEREFORE THEY MAY HAVE HAD AN ADVANTAGE IN THE BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL ALL WE KNOW IS SOON AFTER THE DINGOES WERE BROUGHT IN THYLACINES WERE EXTINCT IN THE AUSTRALIAN MAINLAND AND AFTER THAT THEY ONLY SURVIVED IN TASMANIA
MichaelArcher_2013X@504.68:515.93 THEN UNFORTUNATELY THE NEXT SAD PART OF THE THYLACINE STORY IS THAT EUROPEANS ARRIVED IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT AND THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM THE THINGS THEY VALUED AND THAT INCLUDED SHEEP
MichaelArcher_2013X@549.1:556.86 HAVE A LOOK AT THIS BIT OF FILM FOOTAGE IT MAKES ME VERY SAD BECAUSE WHILE IT 'S A FASCINATING ANIMAL AND IT 'S AMAZING TO THINK
MichaelArcher_2013X@556.97:563.97 THAT WE HAD THE TECHNOLOGY TO FILM IT BEFORE IT ACTUALLY PLUNGED OFF THAT CLIFF OF EXTINCTION
MichaelArcher_2013X@564.21:582.61 WE DIDN 'T UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS SAME TIME HAVE A MOLECULE OF CONCERN ABOUT THE WELFARE FOR THIS SPECIES THESE ARE PHOTOS OF THE LAST SURVIVING THYLACINE BENJAMIN WHO WAS IN THE BEAUMARIS ZOO IN HOBART TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY HAVING SWEPT THIS SPECIES NEARLY OFF THE TABLE
MichaelArcher_2013X@582.86:589.69 THIS ANIMAL WHEN IT DIED OF NEGLECT THE KEEPERS DIDN 'T LET IT INTO THE HUTCH ON A COLD NIGHT IN HOBART
MichaelArcher_2013X@589.85:599.22 IT DIED OF EXPOSURE AND IN THE MORNING WHEN THEY FOUND THE BODY OF BENJAMIN THEY STILL CARED SO LITTLE FOR THIS ANIMAL THAT THEY THREW THE BODY IN THE DUMP
MichaelArcher_2013X@600.31:602.54 DOES IT HAVE TO STAY THIS WAY
MichaelArcher_2013X@636:638.47 COULDN 'T WE THINK ABOUT GOING INTO THIS PUP
MichaelArcher_2013X@638.84:641.61 AND EXTRACTING DNA IF IT 'S THERE
MichaelArcher_2013X@641.62:650.36 AND THEN SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE IN THE FUTURE WE 'LL USE THIS DNA TO BRING THE THYLACINE BACK THE GENETICISTS LAUGHED BUT THIS WAS SIX YEARS BEFORE DOLLY
MichaelArcher_2013X@650.36:667.69 CLONING WAS SCIENCE FICTION IT HAD NOT HAPPENED BUT THEN SUDDENLY CLONING DID HAPPEN AND I THOUGHT WHEN I BECAME DIRECTOR OF THE AUSTRALIAN MUSEUM I 'M GOING TO GIVE THIS A GO I PUT A TEAM TOGETHER WE WENT INTO THAT PUP TO SEE WHAT WAS IN THERE AND WE DID FIND THYLACINE DNA IT WAS
MichaelArcher_2013X@684.51:701.88 AND THAT WAS A WORRY IF THE GOAL HERE WAS TO GET THE DNA OUT AND USE THE DNA DOWN THE TRACK TO TRY TO BRING A THYLACINE BACK WHAT WE DIDN 'T WANT HAPPENING WHEN THE INFORMATION WAS SHOVED INTO THE MACHINE AND THE WHEEL TURNED AROUND AND THE LIGHTS FLASHED WAS TO HAVE A WIZENED OLD HORRIBLE CURATOR POP OUT THE OTHER END OF THE MACHINE
MichaelArcher_2013X@705.92:725.46 SO WE WENT BACK TO THESE SPECIMENS AND WE STARTED DIGGING AROUND AND PARTICULARLY WE LOOKED INTO THE TEETH OF SKULLS HARD PARTS WHERE HUMANS HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THEIR FINGERS AND WE FOUND MUCH BETTER QUALITY DNA WE FOUND NUCLEAR MITOCHONDRIAL GENES IT 'S THERE SO WE GOT IT OKAY WHAT COULD WE DO WITH THIS STUFF WELL GEORGE CHURCH IN HIS BOOK
MichaelArcher_2013X@725.46:731.3 REGENESIS HAS MENTIONED MANY OF THE TECHNIQUES THAT ARE RAPIDLY ADVANCING TO WORK WITH FRAGMENTED DNA
MichaelArcher_2013X@748.37:752.72 AND THEN THE TASMANIAN DEVIL IS GOING TO POP A THYLACINE OUT THE SOUTH END
MichaelArcher_2013X@752.72:760.07 CRITICS OF THIS PROJECT SAY HANG ON THYLACINE TASMANIAN DEVIL THAT 'S GOING TO HURT
MichaelArcher_2013X@790.03:798.86 AND THEY SPLICED IT INTO A MOUSE GENOME BUT THEY PUT A TAG ON IT SO THAT ANYTHING THAT THIS THYLACINE DNA PRODUCED
MichaelArcher_2013X@798.86:811.91 WOULD APPEAR BLUE GREEN IN THE MOUSE BABY IN OTHER WORDS IF THYLACINE TISSUES WERE BEING PRODUCED BY THE THYLACINE DNA IT WOULD BE ABLE TO BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE BABY POPPED UP IT WAS FILLED WITH BLUE GREEN TISSUES
MichaelArcher_2013X@811.91:818.99 AND THAT TELLS US IF WE CAN GET THAT GENOME BACK TOGETHER GET IT INTO A LIVE CELL IT 'S GOING TO PRODUCE THYLACINE STUFF
MichaelArcher_2013X@818.99:822.83 IS THIS A RISK YOU 'VE TAKEN THE BITS OF ONE ANIMAL
MichaelArcher_2013X@822.83:839.92 AND YOU 'VE MIXED THEM INTO THE CELL OF A DIFFERENT KIND OF AN ANIMAL ARE WE GOING TO GET A FRANKENSTEIN YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF WEIRD HYBRID CHIMERA AND THE ANSWER IS NO IF THE ONLY NUCLEAR DNA THAT GOES INTO THIS HYBRID CELL IS THYLACINE DNA THAT 'S THE ONLY THING THAT CAN POP OUT THE OTHER END OF THE DEVIL
MichaelArcher_2013X@839.92:842.78 OKAY IF WE CAN DO THIS
MichaelArcher_2013X@842.78:855.21 COULD WE PUT IT BACK THIS IS A KEY QUESTION FOR EVERYBODY DOES IT HAVE TO STAY IN A LABORATORY OR COULD WE PUT IT BACK WHERE IT BELONGS COULD WE PUT IT BACK IN THE THRONE OF THE KING OF BEASTS IN TASMANIA WHERE IT BELONGS RESTORE THAT ECOSYSTEM OR
MichaelArcher_2013X@855.21:866.52 HAS TASMANIA CHANGED SO MUCH THAT THAT 'S NO LONGER POSSIBLE I 'VE BEEN TO TASMANIA I 'VE BEEN TO MANY OF THE AREAS WHERE THE THYLACINES WERE COMMON I 'VE EVEN SPOKEN TO PEOPLE LIKE PETER CARTER HERE
MichaelArcher_2013X@882.08:895.42 THAT HAS MEMORIES OF WHAT THYLACINES FEEL LIKE WHAT THEY SMELLED LIKE WHAT THEY SOUNDED LIKE HE LED THEM AROUND ON A ROPE HE HAS PERSONAL EXPERIENCES THAT I WOULD GIVE MY LEFT LEG TO HAVE IN MY HEAD
MichaelArcher_2013X@915.16:917.56 AND TEARS CAME INTO HIS EYES
MichaelArcher_2013X@917.56:929.95 HE LOOKED AT THE HUT WE WENT INSIDE THERE WERE THE WOODEN BOARDS ON THE SIDES OF THE HUT WHERE HE AND HIS FATHER AND HIS BROTHER HAD SLEPT AT NIGHT AND HE TOLD ME AS IT ALL WAS FLOODING BACK IN MEMORIES HE SAID I REMEMBER THE THYLACINES GOING AROUND THE HUT
MichaelArcher_2013X@951.44:968.97 AND THE ANIMALS IN THOSE AREAS WERE THE SAME THAT WERE THERE WHEN THE THYLACINE WAS AROUND SO COULD WE PUT IT BACK YES IS THAT ALL WE WOULD DO AND THIS IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUT IT BACK BUT IS THAT THE SAFEST WAY TO MAKE SURE IT NEVER GOES EXTINCT AGAIN AND I DON 'T THINK SO
MichaelArcher_2013X@969.15:972.43 I THINK GRADUALLY AS WE SEE SPECIES ALL AROUND THE WORLD
MichaelArcher_2013X@972.43:989.16 IT 'S KIND OF A MANTRA THAT WILDLIFE IS INCREASINGLY NOT SAFE IN THE WILD WE 'D LOVE TO THINK IT IS BUT WE KNOW IT ISN 'T WE NEED OTHER PARALLEL STRATEGIES COMING ONLINE AND THIS ONE INTERESTS ME SOME OF THE THYLACINES THAT WERE BEING TURNED INTO ZOOS SANCTUARIES EVEN AT THE MUSEUMS HAD COLLAR MARKS ON THE NECK
MichaelArcher_2013X@989.16:1000.78 THEY WERE BEING KEPT AS PETS AND WE KNOW A LOT OF BUSH TALES AND MEMORIES OF PEOPLE WHO HAD THEM AS PETS AND THEY SAY THEY WERE WONDERFUL FRIENDLY THIS PARTICULAR ONE CAME IN OUT OF THE FOREST
MichaelArcher_2013X@1000.78:1018.29 TO LICK THIS BOY AND CURLED UP AROUND THE FIREPLACE TO GO TO SLEEP A WILD ANIMAL AND I 'D LIKE TO ASK THE QUESTION ALL OF WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN ILLEGAL TO KEEP THESE THYLACINES AS PETS THEN WOULD THE THYLACINE BE EXTINCT NOW
MichaelArcher_2013X@1018.29:1023.02 AND I 'M POSITIVE IT WOULDN 'T WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS IN TODAY 'S WORLD
MichaelArcher_2013X@1023.02:1031.45 COULD IT BE THAT GETTING ANIMALS CLOSE TO US SO THAT WE VALUE THEM MAYBE THEY WON 'T GO EXTINCT AND THIS IS SUCH A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR US
MichaelArcher_2013X@1031.45:1036.65 BECAUSE IF WE DON 'T DO THAT WE 'RE GOING TO WATCH MORE OF THESE ANIMALS PLUNGE OFF THE PRECIPICE
