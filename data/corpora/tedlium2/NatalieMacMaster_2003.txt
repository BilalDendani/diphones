NatalieMacMaster_2003@471.59:475.3 SO OUT WENT THE TELEVISION
NatalieMacMaster_2003@500.12:517.39 COME FROM WITHIN OR GO FROM WITHIN BECAUSE WE DIDN 'T WATCH TELEVISION WE DIDN 'T LISTEN TO A LOT OF RADIO WE WENT TO CHURCH AND TO SCHOOL SOMETIMES AND FARMED AND PLAYED MUSIC SO WE WERE ABLE I THINK AT A VERY CRITICAL AGE TO DEVELOP OUR OWN STYLE OUR OWN SELF
NatalieMacMaster_2003@517.39:521.49 AND MY MOTHER PLAYS MY FATHER PLAYS
NatalieMacMaster_2003@521.49:537.55 AND THE STYLE THAT CAME FROM THE OTTAWA VALLEY IN ONTARIO WE CALL IT FRENCH CANADIAN STYLE BUT IT ORIGINATED IN LOGGING CAMPS YEARS AGO HUNDREDS OF MEN WOULD GO UP FOR THE WINTER TO THE CAMPS IN NORTHERN ONTARIO AND IN QUEBEC
NatalieMacMaster_2003@537.55:542.04 AND THEY WERE ALL DIFFERENT CULTURES AND
NatalieMacMaster_2003@542.04:559 THE IRISH THE FRENCH SCOTTISH GERMAN THEY 'D ALL MEET AND OF COURSE AT NIGHT THEY 'D PLAY CARDS AND STEP DANCE AND PLAY FIDDLES AND OVER THE COURSE OF MANY YEARS THE OTTAWA VALLEY FIDDLING KIND OF EVOLVED AND THE OTTAWA VALLEY STEP DANCING EVOLVED
NatalieMacMaster_2003@559:564.23 SO THAT 'S I KIND OF STARTED OUT WITH THAT STYLE AND I QUICKLY
NatalieMacMaster_2003@583.73:591.98 WELL IT 'S JUST SO INTERESTING THAT DONNELL 'S UPBRINGING WAS VERY SIMILAR TO MINE
NatalieMacMaster_2003@626.17:636.65 LITTLE DID I THINK OUR CHILDREN WOULD BE PLAYING INSTRUMENTS YOU KNOW PLAYING MUSIC YEAH TWELVE YEARS ER TWENTY YEARS LATER LITTLE DID SHE THINK HER KIDS WOULD BE GETTING MARRIED
NatalieMacMaster_2003@636.65:642.24 BUT ANYWAY SO THEN I GOT A PHONE CALL
NatalieMacMaster_2003@664.68:666.74 HE ASKED ME OUT FOR SUPPER
NatalieMacMaster_2003@677.6:681.38 THEN WE DATED FOR TWO YEARS BROKE UP FOR TEN GOT BACK TOGETHER AND GOT MARRIED
NatalieMacMaster_2003@701.81:708.31 BURIALS AS A BODY WAS CARRIED OUT FROM THE WAKE SITE TO THE BURIAL SITE THE PROCESSION WAS LED BY A PIPER OR A FIDDLE PLAYER
NatalieMacMaster_2003@1019.95:1027.02 WE 'RE LAUGHING LIKE BECAUSE OUR STYLES ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT AS YOU CAN HEAR
NatalieMacMaster_2003@1027.28:1038.55 AND SO YOU KNOW DONNELL AND I ARE ACTUALLY IN THE PROCESS OF WRITING NEW PIECES OF MUSIC TOGETHER THAT WE CAN PLAY BUT WE DON 'T HAVE ANY OF THOSE READY WE JUST STARTED YESTERDAY
NatalieMacMaster_2003@1326.71:1338.31 BEFORE MOM 'S FAMILY HAD A PIANO IN CAPE BRETON SHE LEARNED TO PLAY THE RHYTHMS ON A PIECE OF BOARD AND THE FIDDLERS WOULD ALL CONGREGATE TO PLAY ON THE COLD WINTER 'S EVENINGS AND MOM WOULD BE BANGING ON THIS BOARD
NatalieMacMaster_2003@1338.31:1343.35 SO WHEN THEY BOUGHT A PIANO THEY BOUGHT IT IN TORONTO AND HAD IT
NatalieMacMaster_2003@1343.35:1360.38 TAKEN BY TRAIN AND BROUGHT IN ON A HORSE A HORSE AND SLEIGH TO THE HOUSE IT BECAME THE ONLY PIANO IN THE REGION AND MOM SAID SHE COULD BASICALLY PLAY AS SOON AS THE PIANO ARRIVED SHE COULD PLAY IT BECAUSE SHE HAD LEARNED ALL THESE RHYTHMS ANYWAY WE FOUND THE PIANO LAST
NatalieMacMaster_2003@1457.47:1471.08 YOU HAD TO WAIT UNTIL THEY WERE FINISHED SO OF COURSE WHAT WE WOULD DO IS WE 'D GET ON THE PIANO AND YOU WOULDN 'T EVEN GET OFF TO EAT BECAUSE YOU WOULDN 'T WANT TO GIVE IT UP TO YOUR BROTHER OR SISTER AND THEY 'D WAIT AND WAIT AND WAIT AND IT 'D BE MIDNIGHT AND YOU 'D BE STILL SITTING THERE ON THE PIANO BUT IT WAS THEIR WAY TO GET US TO PRACTICE
