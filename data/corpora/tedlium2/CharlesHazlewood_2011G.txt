CharlesHazlewood_2011G THROUGH WHICH WE CAN SPIN A MUSICAL NARRATIVE THAT WE ALL BELIEVE IN
CharlesHazlewood_2011G NOW IN THE OLD DAYS CONDUCTING MUSIC MAKING WAS LESS ABOUT TRUST AND MORE FRANKLY ABOUT COERCION UP TO AND AROUND ABOUT THE SECOND WORLD WAR CONDUCTORS WERE INVARIABLY DICTATORS THESE TYRANNICAL FIGURES WHO WOULD REHEARSE NOT JUST THE ORCHESTRA AS A WHOLE BUT INDIVIDUALS WITHIN IT WITHIN AN INCH OF THEIR LIVES
CharlesHazlewood_2011G I AS THE CONDUCTOR HAVE TO COME TO THE REHEARSAL WITH A CAST IRON SENSE OF THE OUTER ARCHITECTURE OF THAT MUSIC WITHIN WHICH THERE IS THEN IMMENSE PERSONAL FREEDOM FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE ORCHESTRA TO SHINE
CharlesHazlewood_2011G FOR MYSELF OF COURSE I HAVE TO COMPLETELY TRUST MY BODY LANGUAGE THAT 'S ALL I HAVE AT THE POINT OF SALE IT 'S SILENT GESTURE
CharlesHazlewood_2011G I CAN HARDLY BARK OUT INSTRUCTIONS WHILE WE 'RE PLAYING
CharlesHazlewood_2011G GENTLEMEN THE SCOTTISH ENSEMBLE
CharlesHazlewood_2011G IN ORDER FOR ALL THIS TO WORK OBVIOUSLY I HAVE GOT TO BE IN A POSITION OF TRUST I HAVE TO TRUST THE ORCHESTRA AND EVEN MORE CRUCIALLY I HAVE TO TRUST MYSELF THINK ABOUT IT WHEN YOU 'RE IN A POSITION OF NOT TRUSTING
CharlesHazlewood_2011G AND I REMEMBER AT THE BEGINNING OF MY CAREER AGAIN AND AGAIN ON THESE DISMAL OUTINGS WITH ORCHESTRAS I WOULD BE GOING COMPLETELY INSANE ON THE PODIUM TRYING TO ENGENDER A SMALL SCALE CRESCENDO REALLY JUST A LITTLE UPSURGE IN VOLUME
CharlesHazlewood_2011G BUGGER ME THEY WOULDN 'T GIVE IT TO ME
CharlesHazlewood_2011G I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THOSE EARLY YEARS WEEPING SILENTLY IN DRESSING ROOMS AND HOW FUTILE SEEMED THE WORDS OF ADVICE TO ME FROM GREAT BRITISH VETERAN CONDUCTOR SIR COLIN DAVIS WHO SAID CONDUCTING CHARLES IS LIKE HOLDING A SMALL BIRD
CharlesHazlewood_2011G NOW A FUNDAMENTAL AND REALLY VISCERALLY IMPORTANT EXPERIENCE FOR ME IN TERMS OF MUSIC HAS BEEN MY ADVENTURES IN SOUTH AFRICA THE MOST DIZZYINGLY MUSICAL COUNTRY ON THE PLANET IN MY VIEW BUT A COUNTRY WHICH THROUGH ITS MUSICAL CULTURE HAS TAUGHT ME ONE FUNDAMENTAL LESSON
CharlesHazlewood_2011G BACK IN TWO THOUSAND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO SOUTH AFRICA TO FORM A NEW OPERA COMPANY SO I WENT OUT THERE AND I AUDITIONED MAINLY IN RURAL TOWNSHIP LOCATIONS RIGHT AROUND THE COUNTRY I HEARD ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SINGERS
CharlesHazlewood_2011G AND PULLED TOGETHER A COMPANY OF FORTY OF THE MOST JAW DROPPINGLY AMAZING YOUNG PERFORMERS THE MAJORITY OF WHOM WERE BLACK BUT THERE WERE A HANDFUL OF WHITE PERFORMERS NOW IT EMERGED EARLY ON IN THE FIRST REHEARSAL PERIOD THAT ONE OF THOSE WHITE PERFORMERS HAD IN HIS PREVIOUS INCARNATION BEEN A MEMBER OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN POLICE FORCE
CharlesHazlewood_2011G AND IN THE LAST YEARS OF THE OLD REGIME HE WOULD ROUTINELY BE DETAILED TO GO INTO THE TOWNSHIP TO AGGRESS THE COMMUNITY
CharlesHazlewood_2011G WE SANG WE SANG
CharlesHazlewood_2011G WE SANG
CharlesHazlewood_2011G AND AMAZINGLY NEW TRUST GREW AND INDEED FRIENDSHIP BLOSSOMED AND THAT SHOWED ME SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH THAT MUSIC MAKING AND OTHER FORMS OF CREATIVITY CAN SO OFTEN GO TO PLACES WHERE MERE WORDS CANNOT
CharlesHazlewood_2011G SO WE GOT SOME SHOWS OFF THE GROUND WE STARTED TOURING THEM INTERNATIONALLY ONE OF THEM WAS CARMEN WE THEN THOUGHT WE 'D MAKE A MOVIE OF CARMEN WHICH WE RECORDED AND SHOT OUTSIDE ON LOCATION IN THE TOWNSHIP OUTSIDE CAPE TOWN CALLED KHAYELITSHA THE PIECE WAS SUNG ENTIRELY IN XHOSA WHICH IS A BEAUTIFULLY MUSICAL LANGUAGE IF YOU DON 'T KNOW IT
CharlesHazlewood_2011G IT 'S CALLED U CARMEN E KHAYELITSHA LITERALLY CARMEN OF KHAYELITSHA I WANT TO PLAY YOU A TINY CLIP OF IT NOW
CharlesHazlewood_2011G FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN TO GIVE YOU PROOF POSITIVE THAT THERE IS NOTHING TINY ABOUT SOUTH AFRICAN MUSIC MAKING
CharlesHazlewood_2011G YOU CAN TEACH A BUNCH OF SOUTH AFRICANS A TUNE IN ABOUT FIVE SECONDS FLAT AND THEN AS IF BY MAGIC THEY WILL SPONTANEOUSLY IMPROVISE A LOAD OF HARMONY AROUND THAT TUNE BECAUSE THEY CAN NOW THOSE OF US THAT LIVE IN THE WEST IF I CAN USE THAT TERM I THINK HAVE A MUCH MORE HIDEBOUND ATTITUDE OR SENSE OF MUSIC
CharlesHazlewood_2011G AND YET LADIES AND GENTLEMEN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US ON THIS PLANET PROBABLY ENGAGES WITH MUSIC ON A DAILY BASIS AND IF I CAN BROADEN THIS OUT FOR A SECOND I 'M WILLING TO BET THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU SITTING IN THIS ROOM WOULD BE HAPPY TO SPEAK WITH ACUITY WITH TOTAL CONFIDENCE ABOUT MOVIES PROBABLY ABOUT LITERATURE
CharlesHazlewood_2011G BUT HOW MANY OF YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE A CONFIDENT ASSERTION ABOUT A PIECE OF CLASSICAL MUSIC WHY IS THIS
CharlesHazlewood_2011G AND WHAT I 'M GOING TO SAY TO YOU NOW IS I 'M JUST URGING YOU TO GET OVER THIS SUPREME LACK OF SELF CONFIDENCE TO TAKE THE PLUNGE TO BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN TRUST YOUR EARS YOU CAN HEAR SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL MUSCLE TISSUE FIBER DNA WHAT MAKES A GREAT PIECE OF MUSIC GREAT
CharlesHazlewood_2011G THE YOUNGEST OF MY CHILDREN WAS BORN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY WHICH AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU DON 'T HAVE AN EXPERIENCE OF IT YOURSELF IS QUITE A BIG THING TO TAKE ON BOARD BUT THE GIFT THAT MY GORGEOUS DAUGHTER HAS GIVEN ME ASIDE FROM HER VERY EXISTENCE
CharlesHazlewood_2011G IS THAT IT 'S OPENED MY EYES TO A WHOLE STRETCH OF THE COMMUNITY THAT WAS HITHERTO HIDDEN THE COMMUNITY OF DISABLED PEOPLE AND I FOUND MYSELF LOOKING AT THE PARALYMPICS AND THINKING HOW INCREDIBLE HOW TECHNOLOGY 'S BEEN HARNESSED TO PROVE BEYOND DOUBT THAT DISABILITY IS NO BARRIER TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF SPORTING ACHIEVEMENT
CharlesHazlewood_2011G YOU CAN 'T TELL ME THAT THERE AREN 'T MILLIONS OF DISABLED PEOPLE IN THE U K ALONE WITH MASSIVE MUSICAL POTENTIAL
CharlesHazlewood_2011G ASTONISHINGLY GIFTED DISABLED MUSICIANS NORMALLY WHEN YOU IMPROVISE AND I DO IT ALL THE TIME AROUND THE WORLD
CharlesHazlewood_2011G THERE 'S THIS INITIAL PERIOD OF HORROR LIKE EVERYONE 'S TOO FRIGHTENED TO THROW THE HAT INTO THE RING AN AWFUL PREGNANT SILENCE
CharlesHazlewood_2011G I WOULD RATHER BE ABLE TO PLAY AN INSTRUMENT
CharlesHazlewood_2011G I ONLY WISH THAT SOME OF THOSE MUSICIANS WERE HERE WITH US TODAY SO YOU COULD SEE AT FIRSTHAND HOW UTTERLY EXTRAORDINARY THEY ARE PARAORCHESTRA IS THE NAME OF THAT PROJECT IF ANY OF YOU THINKS YOU WANT TO HELP ME IN ANY WAY TO ACHIEVE WHAT IS A FAIRLY IMPOSSIBLE AND IMPLAUSIBLE DREAM STILL AT THIS POINT PLEASE LET ME KNOW NOW MY PARTING SHOT COMES COURTESY OF THE GREAT JOSEPH HAYDN
CharlesHazlewood_2011G WONDERFUL AUSTRIAN COMPOSER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY SPENT THE BULK OF HIS LIFE IN THE EMPLOY OF PRINCE NIKOLAUS ESTERHAZY ALONG WITH HIS ORCHESTRA NOW THIS PRINCE LOVED HIS MUSIC
CharlesHazlewood_2011G LONG WAY AWAY IN THOSE DAYS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE MUSICIANS WERE DISCONSOLATE
CharlesHazlewood_2011G HAYDN REMONSTRATED WITH THE PRINCE BUT TO NO AVAIL SO GIVEN THE PRINCE LOVED HIS MUSIC HAYDN THOUGHT HE 'D WRITE A SYMPHONY TO MAKE THE POINT AND WE 'RE GOING TO PLAY JUST THE VERY TAIL END OF THIS SYMPHONY NOW AND YOU 'LL SEE THE ORCHESTRA IN A KIND OF SULLEN REVOLT
CharlesHazlewood_2011G WHERE THERE IS NO TRUST THE MUSIC QUITE SIMPLY WITHERS AWAY
