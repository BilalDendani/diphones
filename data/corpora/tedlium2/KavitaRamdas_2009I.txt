KavitaRamdas_2009I@276.64:280.9 COULD NOT SAVE HIS OWN SISTER FROM THIS SUFFERING

KavitaRamdas_2009I@396.15:406.61 SHE STARTS EVERY LECTURE WITH A PRAYER BUT SHE 'S A SINGLE FEISTY FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT WOMAN IN A COUNTRY WHERE GIRLS ARE MARRIED OFF AT THE AGE OF TWELVE
KavitaRamdas_2009I@406.61:409.99 SHE IS ALSO IMMENSELY PRAGMATIC
KavitaRamdas_2009I@409.99:420.82 THIS HEADSCARF AND THESE CLOTHES SHE SAYS GIVE ME THE FREEDOM TO DO WHAT I NEED TO DO TO SPEAK TO THOSE WHOSE SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE ARE CRITICAL FOR THIS WORK
KavitaRamdas_2009I@420.82:432.82 WHEN I HAD TO OPEN THE SCHOOL IN THE REFUGEE CAMP I WENT TO SEE THE IMAM I TOLD HIM I 'M A BELIEVER AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THESE TERRIBLE CONDITIONS NEED THEIR FAITH TO SURVIVE

KavitaRamdas_2009I@436.5:439.86 HE BEGAN TO COME TWICE A WEEK TO MY CENTER
KavitaRamdas_2009I@439.86:458.58 BECAUSE WOMEN COULD NOT GO TO THE MOSQUE AND AFTER HE WOULD LEAVE WOMEN AND GIRLS WOULD STAY BEHIND WE BEGAN WITH A SMALL LITERACY CLASS TO READ THE KORAN THEN A MATH CLASS THEN AN ENGLISH CLASS THEN COMPUTER CLASSES IN A FEW WEEKS EVERYONE IN THE REFUGEE CAMP WAS IN OUR CLASSES
KavitaRamdas_2009I@460.92:466.49 AT A TIME WHEN TO EDUCATE WOMEN IS A DANGEROUS BUSINESS IN AFGHANISTAN
KavitaRamdas_2009I@466.49:474.75 SHE IS ON THE TALIBAN 'S HIT LIST I WORRY ABOUT HER EVERY TIME SHE TRAVELS ACROSS THAT COUNTRY SHE SHRUGS WHEN I ASK HER ABOUT SAFETY
KavitaRamdas_2009I@489.64:494.1 TURNING THEM INTO INSTRUMENTS OF OPPOSITION AND OPPORTUNITY
KavitaRamdas_2009I@507.18:514.94 TO BE A LESBIAN A DYKE A HOMOSEXUAL IN MOST PARTS OF THE WORLD INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN OUR COUNTRY INDIA
KavitaRamdas_2009I@514.94:527.85 IS TO OCCUPY A PLACE OF IMMENSE DISCOMFORT AND EXTREME PREJUDICE IN POST CONFLICT SOCIETIES LIKE CROATIA WHERE A HYPER NATIONALISM AND RELIGIOSITY HAVE CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT UNBEARABLE
KavitaRamdas_2009I@527.85:533.3 FOR ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE CONSIDERED A SOCIAL OUTCAST SO ENTER A GROUP OF OUT DYKES
KavitaRamdas_2009I@533.3:542.04 YOUNG WOMEN WHO LOVE THE OLD MUSIC THAT ONCE SPREAD ACROSS THAT REGION FROM MACEDONIA TO BOSNIA FROM SERBIA TO SLOVENIA
KavitaRamdas_2009I@542.04:546.06 THESE FOLK SINGERS MET AT COLLEGE AT A GENDER STUDIES PROGRAM
KavitaRamdas_2009I@546.06:559.41 MANY ARE IN THEIR TWENTY S SOME ARE MOTHERS MANY HAVE STRUGGLED TO COME OUT TO THEIR COMMUNITIES IN FAMILIES WHOSE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS MAKE IT HARD TO ACCEPT THAT THEIR DAUGHTERS ARE NOT SICK JUST QUEER
KavitaRamdas_2009I@567.67:573.99 WE BLEND THE TWO I SEE TRADITIONAL MUSIC LIKE A KIND OF REBELLION IN WHICH PEOPLE CAN REALLY SPEAK THEIR VOICE
KavitaRamdas_2009I@573.99:588.66 ESPECIALLY TRADITIONAL SONGS FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC AFTER THE WAR LOTS OF THESE SONGS WERE LOST BUT THEY ARE A PART OF OUR CHILDHOOD AND OUR HISTORY AND WE SHOULD NOT FORGET THEM IMPROBABLY THIS LGBT SINGING CHOIR
KavitaRamdas_2009I@588.66:600.28 HAS DEMONSTRATED HOW WOMEN ARE INVESTING IN TRADITION TO CREATE CHANGE LIKE ALCHEMISTS TURNING DISCORD INTO HARMONY THEIR REPERTOIRE INCLUDES THE CROATIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM
KavitaRamdas_2009I@600.28:603.92 A BOSNIAN LOVE SONG AND SERBIAN DUETS
KavitaRamdas_2009I@603.93:616.43 AND LEAH ADDS WITH A GRIN KAVITA WE ESPECIALLY ARE PROUD OF OUR CHRISTMAS MUSIC BECAUSE IT SHOWS WE ARE OPEN TO RELIGIOUS PRACTICES EVEN THOUGH CATHOLIC CHURCH HATES US LGBT
KavitaRamdas_2009I@616.43:636.02 THEIR CONCERTS DRAW FROM THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES YES BUT ALSO FROM AN OLDER GENERATION A GENERATION THAT MIGHT BE SUSPICIOUS OF HOMOSEXUALITY BUT IS NOSTALGIC FOR ITS OWN MUSIC AND THE PAST IT REPRESENTS ONE FATHER WHO HAD INITIALLY BALKED AT HIS DAUGHTER COMING OUT IN SUCH A CHOIR NOW WRITES SONGS FOR THEM
KavitaRamdas_2009I@636.02:645.73 IN THE MIDDLE AGES TROUBADOURS WOULD TRAVEL ACROSS THE LAND SINGING THEIR TALES AND SHARING THEIR VERSES LESBOR TRAVELS THROUGH THE BALKANS LIKE THIS
KavitaRamdas_2009I@645.73:662.87 SINGING CONNECTING PEOPLE DIVIDED BY RELIGION NATIONALITY AND LANGUAGE BOSNIANS CROATS AND SERBS FIND A RARE SHARED SPACE OF PRIDE IN THEIR HISTORY AND LESBOR REMINDS THEM THAT THE SONGS ONE GROUP OFTEN CLAIMS AS THEIRS ALONE REALLY BELONG TO
KavitaRamdas_2009I@711.85:723.57 SHE WORRIED FOR THEIR LIVES ONE NIGHT SHE HAD A DREAM SHE DREAMT SHE AND THOUSANDS OF OTHER WOMEN ENDED THE BLOODSHED THE NEXT MORNING AT CHURCH SHE ASKED OTHERS HOW THEY FELT
KavitaRamdas_2009I@723.57:737.28 THEY WERE ALL TIRED OF THE FIGHTING WE NEED PEACE AND WE NEED OUR LEADERS TO KNOW WE WILL NOT REST UNTIL THERE IS PEACE AMONG LAYMA 'S FRIENDS WAS A POLICEWOMAN WHO WAS MUSLIM SHE PROMISED TO RAISE THE ISSUE WITH HER COMMUNITY
KavitaRamdas_2009I@737.28:756.52 AT THE NEXT FRIDAY SERMON THE WOMEN WHO WERE SITTING IN THE SIDE ROOM OF THE MOSQUE BEGAN TO SHARE THEIR DISTRESS AT THE STATE OF AFFAIRS WHAT DOES IT MATTER THEY SAID A BULLET DOESN 'T DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A MUSLIM AND A CHRISTIAN THIS SMALL GROUP OF WOMEN DETERMINED TO BRING AN END TO THE WAR AND THEY CHOSE TO USE THEIR TRADITIONS TO MAKE A POINT
KavitaRamdas_2009I@756.52:760.57 LIBERIAN WOMEN USUALLY WEAR LOTS OF JEWELRY AND COLORFUL CLOTHING
KavitaRamdas_2009I@760.57:763.63 BUT NO FOR THE PROTEST THEY DRESSED ALL IN WHITE
KavitaRamdas_2009I@763.63:782.74 NO MAKEUP AS LAYMA SAID WE WORE THE WHITE SAYING WE WERE OUT FOR PEACE THEY STOOD ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD ON WHICH CHARLES TAYLOR 'S MOTORCADE PASSED EVERY DAY THEY STOOD FOR WEEKS FIRST JUST TEN THEN TWENTY THEN FIFTY THEN HUNDREDS OF WOMEN WEARING WHITE SINGING DANCING SAYING THEY WERE OUT FOR PEACE
KavitaRamdas_2009I@782.74:788.53 EVENTUALLY OPPOSING FORCES IN LIBERIA WERE PUSHED TO HOLD PEACE TALKS IN GHANA
KavitaRamdas_2009I@788.53:800.49 THE PEACE TALKS DRAGGED ON AND ON AND ON LAYMA AND HER SISTERS HAD HAD ENOUGH WITH THEIR REMAINING FUNDS THEY TOOK A SMALL GROUP OF WOMEN DOWN TO THE VENUE OF THE PEACE TALKS AND THEY SURROUNDED THE BUILDING
KavitaRamdas_2009I@826.5:838.16 YOU CAN SEE THE POLICEMAN 'S FACE HE LOOKS EMBARRASSED HE BACKS AWAY AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THE POLICE HAVE DISAPPEARED LAYMA SAID TO ME LATER
KavitaRamdas_2009I@853.88:862.71 I DON 'T KNOW IF HE DID IT BECAUSE HE BELIEVED BUT HE KNEW WE WERE NOT GOING TO LEAVE WE WERE NOT GOING TO LEAVE UNTIL THE PEACE ACCORD WAS SIGNED AND THE PEACE ACCORD WAS SIGNED
KavitaRamdas_2009I@874.94:887.94 WHEN SHE MADE HER PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THESE BRAVE WOMEN OF LIBERIA WHO ALLOWED HER TO WIN AGAINST A FOOTBALL STAR THAT 'S SOCCER FOR YOU AMERICANS NO LESS
KavitaRamdas_2009I@887.95:900.7 WOMEN LIKE SAKENA AND LEAH AND LAYMA HAVE HUMBLED ME AND CHANGED ME AND MADE ME REALIZE THAT I SHOULD NOT BE SO QUICK TO JUMP TO ASSUMPTIONS OF ANY KIND
KavitaRamdas_2009I@900.7:907.02 THEY 'VE ALSO SAVED ME FROM MY RIGHTEOUS ANGER BY OFFERING INSIGHTS INTO THIS THIRD WAY
KavitaRamdas_2009I@907.02:922.79 A FILIPINA ACTIVIST ONCE SAID TO ME HOW DO YOU COOK A RICE CAKE WITH HEAT FROM THE BOTTOM AND HEAT FROM THE TOP THE PROTESTS THE MARCHES THE UNCOMPROMISING POSITION THAT WOMEN 'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS FULL STOP
KavitaRamdas_2009I@922.79:927.92 THAT 'S THE HEAT FROM THE BOTTOM THAT 'S MALCOLM X AND THE SUFFRAGISTS AND GAY PRIDE PARADES
KavitaRamdas_2009I@927.92:941.94 BUT WE ALSO NEED THE HEAT FROM THE TOP AND IN MOST PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT TOP IS STILL CONTROLLED BY MEN SO TO PARAPHRASE MARX WOMEN MAKE CHANGE BUT NOT IN CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING
KavitaRamdas_2009I@941.94:953.03 THEY HAVE TO NEGOTIATE THEY HAVE TO SUBVERT TRADITION THAT ONCE SILENCED THEM IN ORDER TO GIVE VOICE TO NEW ASPIRATIONS AND THEY NEED ALLIES FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES
KavitaRamdas_2009I@953.03:965.34 ALLIES LIKE THE IMAM ALLIES LIKE THE FATHER WHO NOW WRITES SONGS FOR A LESBIAN GROUP IN CROATIA ALLIES LIKE THE POLICEMAN WHO HONORED A TABOO AND BACKED AWAY ALLIES LIKE MY FATHER
KavitaRamdas_2009I@965.34:969.78 WHO COULDN 'T HELP HIS SISTER BUT HAS HELPED THREE DAUGHTERS PURSUE THEIR DREAMS
KavitaRamdas_2009I@969.78:982.25 MAYBE THIS IS BECAUSE FEMINISM UNLIKE ALMOST EVERY OTHER SOCIAL MOVEMENT IS NOT A STRUGGLE AGAINST A DISTINCT OPPRESSOR IT 'S NOT THE RULING CLASS OR THE OCCUPIERS OR THE COLONIZERS
KavitaRamdas_2009I@982.25:989.89 IT 'S AGAINST A DEEPLY HELD SET OF BELIEFS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE WOMEN FAR TOO OFTEN HOLD OURSELVES
KavitaRamdas_2009I@989.89:993.47 AND PERHAPS THIS IS THE ULTIMATE GIFT OF FEMINISM
KavitaRamdas_2009I@993.47:1009.52 THAT THE PERSONAL IS IN FACT THE POLITICAL SO THAT AS ELEANOR ROOSEVELT SAID ONCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS THE SAME IS TRUE OF GENDER EQUALITY THAT IT STARTS IN SMALL PLACES CLOSE TO HOME ON THE STREETS YES BUT ALSO IN NEGOTIATIONS AT THE KITCHEN TABLE
KavitaRamdas_2009I@1009.52:1015.19 AND IN THE MARITAL BED AND IN RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LOVERS AND PARENTS AND SISTERS AND FRIENDS
KavitaRamdas_2009I@1015.19:1018.89 AND
KavitaRamdas_2009I@1046.85:1064.24 TO MAKE CHANGE WE CAN WEAR A SARI OR A HIJAB OR PANTS OR A BOUBOU AND WE CAN BE PARTY LEADERS AND PRESIDENTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYERS WE CAN USE OUR TRADITION TO NAVIGATE CHANGE WE CAN DEMILITARIZE SOCIETIES
KavitaRamdas_2009I@1064.24:1070.04 AND POUR RESOURCES INSTEAD INTO RESERVOIRS OF GENUINE SECURITY
KavitaRamdas_2009I@1070.04:1087.98 IT IS IN THESE LITTLE STORIES THESE INDIVIDUAL STORIES THAT I SEE A RADICAL EPIC BEING WRITTEN BY WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD IT IS IN THESE THREADS THAT ARE BEING WOVEN INTO A RESILIENT FABRIC THAT WILL SUSTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT I FIND HOPE
