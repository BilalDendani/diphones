BenCameron_2010X@79.11:80.79 AND MORE AND MORE
BenCameron_2010X@81.24:87.70 YOU KNOW FRANKLY IT'S A SECTOR THAT MANY OF US WHO WORK IN THE FIELD WORRY IS BEING ENDANGERED AND POSSIBLY DISMANTLED BY TECHNOLOGY
BenCameron_2010X@88.14:98.46 WHILE WE INITIALLY HERALDED THE INTERNET AS THE FANTASTIC NEW MARKETING DEVICE THAT WAS GOING TO SOLVE ALL OUR PROBLEMS WE NOW REALIZE THAT THE INTERNET IS IF ANYTHING TOO EFFECTIVE IN THAT REGARD
BenCameron_2010X@98.94:105.78 DEPENDING ON WHO YOU READ AN ARTS ORGANIZATION OR AN ARTIST WHO TRIES TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF A POTENTIAL SINGLE TICKET BUYER
BenCameron_2010X@106.21:118.54 NOW COMPETES WITH BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE THOUSAND DIFFERENT MARKETING MESSAGES A TYPICAL CITIZEN SEE EVERY SINGLE DAY WE NOW KNOW IN FACT THAT TECHNOLOGY IS OUR BIGGEST COMPETITOR FOR LEISURE TIME
BenCameron_2010X@119.21:129.60 FIVE YEAS AGO GEN X 'ERS SPENT TWENTY POINT SEVEN HOURS ONLINE AND TV THE MAJORITY ON TV GEN Y 'ERS SPENT EVEN MORE TWENTY THREE POINT EIGHT HOURS THE MAJORITY ONLINE
BenCameron_2010X@130.06:143.18 AND NOW A TYPICAL UNIVERSITY ENTERING STUDENT ARRIVES AT COLLEGE ALREADY HAVING SPENT TWENTY THOUSAND HOURS ONLINE AND AN ADDITIONAL TEN THOUSAND HOURS PLAYING VIDEO GAMES
BenCameron_2010X@154.74:164.75 WE'RE AFRAID THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS ALTERED OUR VERY ASSUMPTIONS OF CULTURAL CONSUMPTION THANKS TO THE INTERNET WE BELIEVE WE CAN GET ANYTHING WE WANT WHENEVER WE WANT IT DELIVERED TO OUR OWN DOORSTEP
BenCameron_2010X@165.18:174.31 WE CAN SHOP AT THREE IN THE MORNING OR EIGHT AT NIGHT ORDERING JEANS TAILOR MADE FOR OUR UNIQUE BODY TYPES EXPECTATIONS OF PERSONALIZATION AND CUSTOMIZATION
BenCameron_2010X@174.66:184.04 THAT THE LIVE PERFORMING ARTS WHICH HAVE SET CURTAIN TIMES SET VENUES ATTENDANT INCONVENIENCES OF TRAVEL PARKING AND THE LIKE SIMPLY CANNOT MEET
BenCameron_2010X@185.07:192.82 AND WE'RE ALL ACUTELY AWARE WHAT'S IT GOING TO MEAN IN THE FUTURE WHEN WE ASK SOMEONE TO PAY A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR A SYMPHONY OPERA OR BALLET TICKET
BenCameron_2010X@193.70:199.52 CULTURAL CONSUMER IS USED TO DOWNLOADING ON THE INTERNET TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY FOR NINETY NINE CENTS A SONG
BenCameron_2010X@199.63:209.35 OR FOR FREE THESE ARE ENORMOUS QUESTIONS FOR THOSE OF US WHO WORK IN THIS TERRAIN BUT AS PARTICULAR AS THEY FEEL TO US WE KNOW WE'RE NOT
BenCameron_2010X@210.63:224.26 ALL OF US ARE ENGAGED IN A SEISMIC FUNDAMENTAL REALIGNMENT OF CULTURE AND COMMUNICATIONS A REALIGNMENT THAT IS SHAKING AND DECIMATING THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY THE MAGAZINE INDUSTRY THE BOOK AND PUBLISHING INDUSTRY AND MORE
BenCameron_2010X@225.35:233.54 SADDLED IN THE PERFORMING ARTS AS WE ARE BY ANTIQUATED UNION AGREEMENTS THAT INHIBIT AND OFTEN PROHIBIT MECHANICAL REPRODUCTION AND STREAMING
BenCameron_2010X@234.20:248.43 LOCKED INTO LARGE FACILITIES THAT WERE DESIGNED TO OSSIFY THE IDEAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARTIST AND AUDIENCE MOST APPROPRIATE TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND LOCKED INTO A BUSINESS MODEL DEPENDENT ON HIGH TICKET REVENUES WHERE WE CHARGE EXORBITANT PRICES
BenCameron_2010X@249.37:255.35 MANY OF US SHUDDER IN THE WAKE OF THE COLLAPSE OF TOWER RECORDS AND ASK OURSELVES ARE WE NEXT
BenCameron_2010X@256.73:270.60 EVERYONE I TALK TO IN PERFORMING ARTS RESONATES TO THE WORDS OF ADRIENNE RICH WHO IN DOCTOREAMS OF A COMMON LANGUAGE WROTE WE ARE OUT IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS NO LANGUAGE NO LAWS WHATEVER WE DO TOGETHER IS PURE INVENTION THE MAPS THEY
BenCameron_2010X@284.02:294.60 NOW RATHER THAN SAYING THAT WE'RE ON THE BRINK OF OUR OWN ANNIHILATION I PREFER TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ENGAGED IN A FUNDAMENTAL REFORMATION A REFORMATION LIKE THE RELIGIOUS REFORMATION OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
BenCameron_2010X@295.29:304.24 THE ARTS REFORMATION LIKE THE RELIGIOUS REFORMATION IS SPURRED IN PART BY TECHNOLOGY WITH INDEED THE PRINTING PRESS REALLY LEADING THE CHARGE ON THE RELIGIOUS REFORMATION
BenCameron_2010X@304.85:312.43 BOTH REFORMATIONS WERE PREDICATED ON FRACTIOUS DISCUSSION INTERNAL SELF DOUBT AND MASSIVE REALIGNMENT OF ANTIQUATED BUSINESS MODELS
BenCameron_2010X@313.25:320.00 AND AT HEART BOTH REFORMATIONS I THINK WERE ASKING THE QUESTIONS WHO 'S ENTITLED TO PRACTICE HOW ARE THEY ENTITLED TO PRACTICE
BenCameron_2010X@320.11:326.29 AND INDEED DO WE NEED ANYONE TO INTERMEDIATE FOR US IN ORDER TO HAVE AN EXPERIENCE WITH A SPIRITUAL
BenCameron_2010X@329.33:337.26 CHRIS ANDERSON SOMEONE I TRUST YOU ALL KNOW EDITOR AND CHIEF OF WIRED MAGAZINE AND AUTHOR OF THE LONG TAIL REALLY WAS THE FIRST FOR ME TO NAIL A LOT OF THIS
BenCameron_2010X@338.10:351.55 HE WROTE A LONG TIME AGO YOU KNOW THANKS TO THE INVENTION OF THE INTERNET WEB TECHNOLOGY MINI CAMS AND MORE THE MEANS OF ARTISTIC PRODUCTION HAVE BEEN DEMOCRATIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY
BenCameron_2010X@363.30:368.58 AND NOW WHO IN THIS ROOM DOESN'T KNOW A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD HARD AT WORK ON HER SECOND THIRD OR FOURTH MOVIE
BenCameron_2010X@371.27:377.46 SIMILARLY THE MEANS OF ARTISTIC DISTRIBUTION HAVE BEEN DEMOCRATIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HUMAN HISTORY AGAIN IN THE
BenCameron_2010X@377.95:385.30 WARNER BROS RKO DID THAT FOR YOU NOW GO TO YOUTUBE FACEBOOK YOU HAVE WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTION WITHOUT LEAVING THE PRIVACY OF YOUR OWN
BenCameron_2010X@387.51:395.53 THIS DOUBLE IMPACT IS OCCASIONING A MASSIVE REDEFINITION OF THE CULTURAL MARKET A TIME WHEN ANYONE IS A POTENTIAL AUTHOR
BenCameron_2010X@405.32:414.82 BUT THE NUMBER OF ARTS PARTICIPANTS PEOPLE WHO WRITE POETRY WHO SING SONGS WHO PERFORM IN CHURCH CHOIRS IS EXPLODING BEYOND OUR WILDEST IMAGINATIONS
BenCameron_2010X@415.79:424.65 THIS GROUP OTHERS HAVE CALLED THE PRO AMS AMATEUR ARTISTS DOING WORK AT A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL YOU SEE THEM ON YOUTUBE IN DANCE COMPETITIONS FILM FESTIVALS AND MORE
BenCameron_2010X@425.11:432.35 THEY ARE RADICALLY EXPANDING OUR NOTIONS OF THE POTENTIAL OF AN AESTHETIC VOCABULARY WHILE THEY ARE CHALLENGING AND UNDERMINING THE
BenCameron_2010X@432.61:441.17 CULTURAL AUTONOMY OF OUR TRADITIONAL INSTITUTIONS ULTIMATELY WE NOW LIVE IN A WORLD DEFINED NOT BY CONSUMPTION BUT BY PARTICIPATION
BenCameron_2010X@453.52:465.85 THEY CURRENTLY ARE THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR ARTISTS TO HAVE LIVES OF ECONOMIC DIGNITY NOT OPULENCE OF DIGNITY AND THEY ARE THE PLACES WHERE ARTISTS WHO DESERVE AND WANT TO WORK AT A CERTAIN SCALE OF RESOURCES WILL FIND A HOME
BenCameron_2010X@466.97:477.29 BUT TO VIEW THEM AS SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ENTIRETY OF THE ARTS COMMUNITY IS BY FAR TOO SHORT SIGHTED AND INDEED WHILE WE'VE TENDED TO POLARIZE THE AMATEUR FROM THE PROFESSIONAL
BenCameron_2010X@477.59:485.30 THE SINGLE MOST EXCITING DEVELOPMENT IN THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS HAS BEEN THE RISE OF THE PROFESSIONAL HYBRID ARTIST
BenCameron_2010X@485.69:496.07 THE PROFESSIONAL ARTIST WHO WORKS NOT PRIMARILY IN THE CONCERT HALL OR ON THE STAGE BUT MOST FREQUENTLY AROUND WOMEN 'S RIGHTS OR HUMAN RIGHTS OR ON GLOBAL WARMING ISSUES OR AIDS RELIEF FOR MORE
BenCameron_2010X@496.45:507.18 NOT OUT OF ECONOMIC NECESSITY BUT OUT OF A DEEP ORGANIC CONVICTION THAT THE WORK THAT SHE OR HE IS CALLED TO DO CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE TRADITIONAL HERMETIC ARTS ENVIRONMENT
BenCameron_2010X@508.24:515.94 TODAY 'S DANCE WORLD IS NOT DEFINED SOLELY BY THE ROYAL WINNIPEG BALLET OR THE NATIONAL BALLET OF CANADA BUT BY LIZ LERMAN 'S DANCE EXCHANGE
BenCameron_2010X@516.28:522.69 A MULTI GENERATIONAL PROFESSIONAL DANCE COMPANY WHOSE DANCERS RANGE IN AGE FROM EIGHTEEN TO EIGHTY TWO
BenCameron_2010X@523.05:534.64 AND WHO WORK WITH GENOMIC SCIENTISTS TO EMBODY THE DNA STRAND AND WITH NUCLEAR PHYSICISTS AT CERN TODAY 'S PROFESSIONAL THEATER COMMUNITY IS DEFINED NOT ONLY THE SHAW AND STRATFORD FESTIVALS
BenCameron_2010X@534.99:543.66 BUT BY THE CORNERSTONE THEATER OF LOS ANGELES A COLLECTIVE OF ARTISTS THAT AFTER NINE ELEVEN BROUGHT TOGETHER TEN DIFFERENT RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES
BenCameron_2010X@545.73:554.20 THE MUSLIM THE JEWISH EVEN THE NATIVE AMERICAN AND THE GAY AND LESBIAN COMMUNITIES OF FAITH HELPING THEM CREATE THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL PLAYS
BenCameron_2010X@554.46:562.55 AND ONE MASSIVE PLAY WHERE THEY EXPLORED THE DIFFERENCES IN THEIR FAITH AND FOUND COMMONALITY AS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TOWARD CROSS
BenCameron_2010X@565.33:577.91 TODAY 'S PERFORMERS LIKE RHODESSA JONES WORK IN WOMEN 'S PRISONS HELPING WOMEN PRISONERS ARTICULATE THE PAIN OF INCARCERATION WHILE TODAY 'S PLAYWRIGHTS AND DIRECTORS WORK WITH YOUNG GANGS TO FIND ALTERNATE CHANNELS TO VIOLENCE AND MORE AND
BenCameron_2010X@578.36:588.89 AND MORE AND INDEED I THINK RATHER THAN BEING ANNIHILATED THE PERFORMING ARTS ARE POSED ON THE BRINK OF A TIME WHEN WE WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN WE HAVE EVER BEEN
BenCameron_2010X@590.33:599.29 FOR A LONG TIME WE ARE CRITICAL TO THE HEALTH OF THE ECONOMIC COMMUNITIES IN YOUR TOWN AND ABSOLUTELY I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT EVERY DOLLAR SPENT ON A PERFORMING ARTS TICKET IN A COMMUNITY
BenCameron_2010X@633.18:642.87 EMPATHY TO ARTICULATE CHANGE TO MOTIVATE OTHERS THE VERY CAPACITIES THAT THE ARTS CULTIVATE WITH EVERY ENCOUNTER ESPECIALLY
BenCameron_2010X@643.95:656.03 AS WE ALL MUST CONFRONT THE FALLACY OF A MARKET ONLY ORIENTATION UNINFORMED BY SOCIAL CONSCIENCE WE MUST SEIZE AND CELEBRATE THE POWER OF THE ARTS TO SHAPE OUR INDIVIDUAL AND NATIONAL CHARACTERS
BenCameron_2010X@656.26:664.38 AND ESPECIALLY CHARACTERS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ALL TOO OFTEN ARE SUBJECTED BOMBARDMENT OF SENSATION RATHER THAN DIGESTED EXPERIENCE
BenCameron_2010X@676.67:682.86 AND IN A CONTEXT OF ANALYSIS WHERE THE THING WE HEAR MOST REPEATEDLY DAY IN DAY OUT IN THE UNITED STATES
BenCameron_2010X@683.13:693.14 IN EVERY TRAIN STATION EVERY BUS STATION EVERY PLANE STATION IS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PLEASE REPORT ANY SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR OR SUSPICIOUS INDIVIDUALS TO THE AUTHORITIES NEAREST YOU
BenCameron_2010X@693.52:704.68 WHEN ALL OF THESE WAYS WE ARE ENCOURAGED TO VIEW OUR FELLOW HUMAN BEING WITH HOSTILITY AND FEAR AND CONTEMPT AND SUSPICION THE ARTS WHATEVER THEY DO WHENEVER THEY CALL US TOGETHER INVITE US
BenCameron_2010X@705.10:715.91 TO LOOK AT OUR FELLOW HUMAN BEING WITH GENEROSITY AND CURIOSITY GOD KNOWS IF WE EVER NEEDED THAT CAPACITY IN HUMAN HISTORY WE NEED IT
BenCameron_2010X@720.48:730.41 YOU KNOW WE'RE BOUND TOGETHER NOT I THINK BY TECHNOLOGY ENTERTAINMENT AND DESIGN BUT BY COMMON CAUSE WE WORK TO PROMOTE HEALTHY VIBRANT SOCIETIES
BenCameron_2010X@731.21:736.94 TO AMELIORATE HUMAN SUFFERING TO PROMOTE A MORE THOUGHTFUL SUBSTANTIVE
BenCameron_2010X@740.23:748.00 I SALUTE ALL OF YOU AS ACTIVISTS IN THAT QUEST AND URGE YOU TO EMBRACE AND HOLD DEAR THE ARTS IN YOUR WORK WHATEVER YOUR PURPOSE MAY BE
BenCameron_2010X@748.78:758.32 I PROMISE YOU THE HAND OF THE DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION IS STRETCHED OUT IN FRIENDSHIP FOR NOW AND YEARS TO COME AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS AND YOUR PATIENCE IN LISTENING TO ME THIS AFTERNOON THANK YOU
