JoelLevine_2009X@16.91:24.13 ABOUT FOUR POINT SIX BILLION YEARS OF HISTORY IN EIGHTEEN MINUTES THAT'S THREE HUNDRED MILLION
JoelLevine_2009X@39.40:53.12 WELL KNOWN SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL THE NEW YORK TIMES WROTE IN ITS EDITORIAL MARS IS UNINTERESTING IT'S A DEAD WORLD NASA SHOULD NOT SPEND ANY TIME OR EFFORT STUDYING MARS ANYMORE
JoelLevine_2009X@63.52:69.02 ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS IN ALL OF SCIENCE IS THERE LIFE OUTSIDE OF
JoelLevine_2009X@69.88:81.61 I BELIEVE THAT MARS IS THE MOST LIKELY TARGET FOR LIFE OUTSIDE THE EARTH I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IN A FEW MINUTES SOME AMAZING MEASUREMENTS THAT SUGGEST THERE MAY BE LIFE ON MARS
JoelLevine_2009X@106.22:116.35 THIS IS THE FIRST PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN FROM THE SURFACE OF ANY PLANET THIS IS A VIKING LANDER PHOTOGRAPH OF THE SURFACE OF MARS AND YES THE RED PLANET
JoelLevine_2009X@118.13:132.36 MARS IS HALF THE SIZE OF THE EARTH BUT BECAUSE TWO THREE OF THE EARTH IS COVERED BY WATER THE LAND AREA ON MARS IS COMPARABLE TO THE LAND AREA ON EARTH SO MARS IS A PRETTY BIG PLACE EVEN THOUGH IT'S HALF THE SIZE
JoelLevine_2009X@133.29:146.54 WE HAVE OBTAINED TOPOGRAPHIC MEASUREMENTS OF THE SURFACE OF MARS WE UNDERSTAND THE ELEVATION DIFFERENCES WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT MARS MARS HAS THE LARGEST VOLCANO IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM
JoelLevine_2009X@155.99:170.55 MARS HAS THE LARGEST IMPACT CRATER IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM HELLAS BASIN THIS IS TWO THOUSAND MILES ACROSS IF YOU HAPPENED TO BE ON MARS WHEN THIS IMPACTOR HIT IT WAS A REALLY BAD DAY ON MARS
JoelLevine_2009X@172.60:178.49 THIS IS OLYMPUS MONS THIS IS BIGGER THAN THE STATE OF ARIZONA VOLCANOS ARE IMPORTANT
JoelLevine_2009X@189.18:199.63 MAP OF THE UNITED STATES THREE THOUSAND MILES ACROSS ONE OF THE MOST INTRIGUING FEATURES ABOUT MARS THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE SAYS ONE OF THE TEN MAJOR MYSTERIES OF THE
JoelLevine_2009X@200.30:207.40 SPACE AGE IS WHY CERTAIN AREAS OF MARS ARE SO HIGHLY MAGNETIZED WE CALL THIS CRUSTAL MAGNETISM
JoelLevine_2009X@207.73:216.55 THERE ARE REGIONS ON MARS WHERE FOR SOME REASON WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY AT THIS POINT THE SURFACE IS VERY VERY HIGHLY MAGNETIZED
JoelLevine_2009X@216.94:223.94 IS THERE WATER ON MARS THE ANSWER IS NO THERE IS NO LIQUID WATER ON THE SURFACE OF MARS TODAY BUT
JoelLevine_2009X@224.17:232.42 THERE IS INTRIGUING EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE EARLY HISTORY OF MARS THERE MAY HAVE BEEN RIVERS AND FAST FLOWING WATER
JoelLevine_2009X@233.41:237.00 TODAY MARS IS VERY VERY DRY WE BELIEVE THERE IS SOME WATER
JoelLevine_2009X@237.73:245.82 IN THE POLAR CAPS THERE ARE POLAR CAPS OF NORTH POLE AND SOUTH POLE HERE ARE SOME RECENT IMAGES THIS IS FROM SPIRIT AND OPPORTUNITY
JoelLevine_2009X@254.11:264.21 WATER IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU WANT LIFE YOU HAVE TO HAVE WATER WATER IS THE KEY INGREDIENT IN THE EVOLUTION THE ORIGIN OF LIFE ON A PLANET
JoelLevine_2009X@264.95:275.41 HERE IS SOME PICTURE OF ANTARCTICA AND A PICTURE OF OLYMPUS MONS VERY SIMILAR FEATURES GLACIERS SO THIS IS FROZEN WATER THIS IS ICE WATER ON MARS
JoelLevine_2009X@276.24:284.13 THIS IS MY FAVORITE PICTURE THIS WAS JUST TAKEN A FEW WEEKS AGO IT HAS NOT BEEN SEEN PUBLICLY THIS IS EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY
JoelLevine_2009X@284.50:292.80 MARS EXPRESS IMAGE OF A CRATER ON MARS AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CRATER WE HAVE LIQUID WATER WE HAVE ICE VERY INTRIGUING PHOTOGRAPH
JoelLevine_2009X@293.47:302.51 WE NOW BELIEVE THAT IN THE EARLY HISTORY OF MARS WHICH IS FOUR POINT SIX BILLION YEARS AGO FOUR POINT SIX BILLION YEARS AGO
JoelLevine_2009X@303.09:311.39 MARS WAS VERY EARTH LIKE MARS HAD RIVERS MARS HAD LAKES BUT MORE IMPORTANT MARS HAD PLANETARY SCALE OCEANS
JoelLevine_2009X@311.81:322.28 WE BELIEVE THAT THE OCEANS WERE IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE AND THIS AREA IN BLUE WHICH SHOWS A DEPRESSION OF ABOUT FOUR MILES WAS THE ANCIENT
JoelLevine_2009X@322.67:330.30 OCEAN AREA ON THE SURFACE OF MARS WHERE DID THE OCEANS WORTH OF WATER ON MARS GO WELL WE HAVE AN IDEA
JoelLevine_2009X@330.82:339.79 THIS IS A MEASUREMENT WE OBTAINED A FEW YEARS AGO FROM A MARS ORBITING SATELLITE CALLED ODYSSEY SUB SURFACE WATER ON MARS
JoelLevine_2009X@340.15:347.90 FROZEN IN THE FORM OF ICE AND THIS SHOWS THE PERCENT IF IT'S A BLUE ISH COLOR IT MEANS SIXTEEN PERCENT BY WEIGHT
JoelLevine_2009X@348.46:356.07 SIXTEEN PERCENT BY WEIGHT OF THE INTERIOR CONTAINS FROZEN WATER OR ICE SO THERE IS A LOT OF WATER BELOW THE SURFACE
JoelLevine_2009X@356.52:366.32 THE MOST INTRIGUING AND PUZZLING MEASUREMENT IN MY OPINION WE'VE OBTAINED OF MARS WAS RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR
JoelLevine_2009X@366.61:375.14 IN THE MAGAZINE SCIENCE AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THE PRESENCE OF THE GAS METHANE CH FOUR
JoelLevine_2009X@375.96:384.46 IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS AND YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE THREE DISTINCT REGIONS OF METHANE WHY IS METHANE IMPORTANT BECAUSE ON EARTH
JoelLevine_2009X@384.83:393.02 ALMOST ALL NINETY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT OF THE METHANE IS PRODUCED BY LIVING SYSTEMS NOT LITTLE GREEN MEN
JoelLevine_2009X@393.68:408.17 BUT MICROSCOPIC LIFE BELOW THE SURFACE OR AT THE SURFACE WE NOW HAVE EVIDENCE THAT METHANE IS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS A GAS THAT ON EARTH IS BIOGENIC IN ORIGIN PRODUCED BY LIVING SYSTEMS
JoelLevine_2009X@408.72:416.00 THESE ARE THE THREE PLUMES A B ONE B TWO AND THIS IS THE TERRAIN IT APPEARS OVER
JoelLevine_2009X@416.29:427.48 AND WE KNOW FROM GEOLOGICAL STUDIES THAT THESE REGIONS ARE THE OLDEST REGIONS ON MARS IN FACT THE EARTH AND MARS ARE BOTH FOUR POINT SIX BILLION YEARS OLD
JoelLevine_2009X@428.52:437.20 THE OLDEST ROCK ON EARTH IS ONLY THREE POINT SIX BILLION THE REASON THERE IS A BILLION YEAR GAP IN OUR GEOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING
JoelLevine_2009X@437.51:446.32 IS BECAUSE OF PLATE TECTONICS THE CRUST OF THE EARTH HAS BEEN RECYCLED WE HAVE NO GEOLOGICAL RECORD PRIOR FOR THE FIRST BILLION YEARS
JoelLevine_2009X@446.67:456.71 THAT RECORD EXISTS ON MARS AND THIS TERRAIN THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT DATES BACK TO FOUR POINT SIX BILLION YEARS WHEN EARTH AND MARS WERE
JoelLevine_2009X@457.49:458.41 IT WAS A TUESDAY
JoelLevine_2009X@461.36:469.87 THIS IS A MAP THAT SHOWS WHERE WE'VE PUT OUR SPACECRAFT ON THE SURFACE OF MARS HERE IS VIKING I VIKING
JoelLevine_2009X@470.83:477.30 THIS IS OPPORTUNITY THIS IS SPIRIT THIS IS MARS PATHFINDER THIS IS PHOENIX WE JUST PUT TWO YEARS AGO
JoelLevine_2009X@478.09:488.20 NOTICE ALL OF OUR ROVERS AND ALL OF OUR LANDERS HAVE GONE TO THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE THAT'S BECAUSE THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE IS THE REGION OF THE ANCIENT
JoelLevine_2009X@489.35:498.01 OCEAN BASIN THERE AREN'T MANY CRATERS AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE WATER PROTECTED THE BASIN FROM BEING IMPACTED BY ASTEROIDS
JoelLevine_2009X@508.33:516.15 A VERY VERY DIFFERENT PLACE GEOLOGICALLY LOOK WHERE THE METHANE IS THE METHANE IS IN A VERY ROUGH TERRAIN AREA
JoelLevine_2009X@518.49:522.34 WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERIES ON MARS
JoelLevine_2009X@524.02:525.52 WE ASKED THIS QUESTION
JoelLevine_2009X@526.33:538.95 TEN YEARS AGO WE INVITED TEN OF THE TOP MARS SCIENTISTS TO THE LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER FOR TWO DAYS WE ADDRESSED ON THE BOARD THE MAJOR QUESTIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN
JoelLevine_2009X@540.16:550.01 AND WE SPENT TWO DAYS DECIDING HOW TO BEST ANSWER THIS QUESTION AND THE RESULT OF OUR MEETING WAS A
JoelLevine_2009X@551.24:555.27 ROCKET POWERED AIRPLANE WE CALL ARES IT'S
JoelLevine_2009X@555.72:564.90 AERIAL REGIONAL SCALE ENVIRONMENTAL SURVEYOR THERE IS A MODEL OF ARES HERE THIS IS A TWENTY PERCENT SCALE MODEL THIS AIRPLANE
JoelLevine_2009X@565.18:578.04 WAS DESIGNED AT THE LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER IF ANY PLACE IN THE WORLD CAN BUILD AN AIRPLANE TO FLY ON MARS IT'S THE LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER FOR ALMOST ONE HUNDRED YEARS A LEADING CENTER OF AERONAUTICS IN THE WORLD
JoelLevine_2009X@578.82:586.22 WE FLY ABOUT A MILE ABOVE THE SURFACE WE COVER HUNDREDS OF MILES AND WE FLY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES AN HOUR
JoelLevine_2009X@586.64:601.31 WE CAN DO THINGS THAT ROVERS CAN'T DO AND LANDERS CAN'T DO WE CAN FLY ABOVE MOUNTAINS VOLCANOES IMPACT CRATERS WE FLY OVER VALLEYS WE CAN FLY OVER SURFACE MAGNETISM THE POLAR CAPS SUBSURFACE WATER
JoelLevine_2009X@601.46:608.84 AND WE CAN SEARCH FOR LIFE ON MARS BUT OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE AS WE FLY THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS
JoelLevine_2009X@609.08:616.79 WE TRANSMIT THAT JOURNEY THE FIRST FLIGHT OF AN AIRPLANE OUTSIDE OF THE EARTH WE TRANSMIT THOSE IMAGES BACK TO EARTH
JoelLevine_2009X@617.66:626.23 AND OUR GOAL IS TO INSPIRE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WHO IS PAYING FOR THIS MISSION THROUGH TAX DOLLARS BUT MORE IMPORTANT
JoelLevine_2009X@626.55:635.64 WE WILL INSPIRE THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS TECHNOLOGISTS ENGINEERS AND MATHEMATICIANS AND THAT'S A CRITICAL AREA
JoelLevine_2009X@636.05:640.72 NATIONAL SECURITY AND ECONOMIC VITALITY TO MAKE SURE
JoelLevine_2009X@641.41:646.97 WE PRODUCE THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS ENGINEERS MATHEMATICIANS AND TECHNOLOGISTS
JoelLevine_2009X@647.97:657.92 THIS IS WHAT ARES LOOKS LIKE AS IT FLIES OVER MARS WE PREPROGRAM IT WE WILL FLY WHERE THE METHANE IS WE WILL HAVE INSTRUMENTS ABOARD THE PLANE
JoelLevine_2009X@658.59:667.17 WILL SAMPLE EVERY THREE MINUTES THE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS WE WILL LOOK FOR METHANE AS WELL AS OTHER GASSES PRODUCED BY LIVING SYSTEMS
JoelLevine_2009X@667.48:674.14 WE WILL PINPOINT WHERE THESE GASES EMANATE FROM BECAUSE WE CAN MEASURE THE GRADIENT WHERE IT COMES FROM
JoelLevine_2009X@684.47:686.30 WORDS VERY CAREFULLY
JoelLevine_2009X@687.14:699.11 THE PROBLEM IS WE DON'T FLY IT TO MARS WE PUT IT IN A SPACECRAFT AND WE SEND IT TO MARS THE PROBLEM IS THE SPACECRAFT 'S LARGEST DIAMETER
JoelLevine_2009X@699.53:708.34 IS NINE FEET ARES IS TWENTY ONE FOOT WINGSPAN SEVENTEEN FEET LONG HOW DO WE GET IT TO MARS
JoelLevine_2009X@708.60:715.90 WE FOLD IT AND WE TRANSPORT IT IN A SPACECRAFT AND WE HAVE IT IN SOMETHING CALLED AN
JoelLevine_2009X@717.14:721.06 THIS IS HOW WE DO IT AND WE HAVE A LITTLE VIDEO THAT
JoelLevine_2009X@724.28:725.29 FOUR THREE
JoelLevine_2009X@750.35:756.59 TAKING NINE MONTHS TO GET TO MARS IT ENTERS THE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS A LOT
JoelLevine_2009X@764.88:773.86 OPENS UP TO SLOW IT DOWN THE THERMAL TILES FALL OFF THE AIRPLANE IS EXPOSED TO THE ATMOSPHERE FOR THE FIRST TIME
JoelLevine_2009X@785.42:798.30 WE BELIEVE THAT IN ONE HOUR FLIGHT WE CAN REWRITE THE TEXTBOOK ON MARS BY MAKING HIGH RESOLUTION MEASUREMENTS OF THE ATMOSPHERE LOOKING FOR GASES OF BIOGENIC ORIGIN LOOKING FOR
JoelLevine_2009X@810.93:823.51 HOW DO WE KNOW WE CAN DO IT BECAUSE WE HAVE TESTED ARES MODEL SEVERAL MODELS IN A HALF A DOZEN WIND TUNNELS IN THE NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER FOR EIGHT YEARS UNDER MARS
JoelLevine_2009X@825.09:830.34 AND OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE IS WE TEST ARES IN THE EARTH 'S ATMOSPHERE
JoelLevine_2009X@830.87:838.97 AT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FEET WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO THE DENSITY AND PRESSURE ON THE ATMOSPHERE ON MARS WHERE WE'LL FLY
JoelLevine_2009X@848.48:855.53 SHOW YOU ONE OF OUR TESTS THIS IS A HALF SCALE MODEL THIS IS A HIGH ALTITUDE HELIUM BALLOON THIS IS
JoelLevine_2009X@858.20:867.70 WE PUT THE FOLDED AIRPLANE ON THE BALLOON IT TOOK ABOUT THREE HOURS TO GET UP THERE AND THEN WE RELEASED IT ON COMMAND AT ONE HUNDRED AND THREE THOUSAND FEET
JoelLevine_2009X@868.13:878.20 AND WE DEPLOY THE AIRPLANE AND EVERYTHING WORKS PERFECTLY AND WE'VE DONE HIGH ALTITUDE AND LOW ALTITUDE TESTS JUST TO PERFECT THIS TECHNIQUE
JoelLevine_2009X@880.42:893.67 WE'RE READY TO GO I HAVE A SCALE MODEL HERE BUT WE HAVE A FULL SCALE MODEL IN STORAGE AT THE NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER WE'RE READY TO GO ALL WE NEED IS A CHECK FROM NASA HEADQUARTERS
JoelLevine_2009X@895.99:902.01 TO COVER THE COSTS I'M PREPARED TO DONATE MY HONORARIUM FOR TODAY 'S TALK FOR THIS MISSION
JoelLevine_2009X@903.36:912.70 IS ACTUALLY NO HONORARIUM FOR ANYONE FOR THIS THING THIS IS THE ARES TEAM WE HAVE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SCIENTISTS ENGINEERS WHERE
JoelLevine_2009X@913.22:921.66 WITH JET PROPULSION LABORATORY GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER AMES RESEARCH CENTER AND HALF A DOZEN MAJOR UNIVERSITIES AND CORPORATIONS IN DEVELOPING THIS
JoelLevine_2009X@921.95:928.57 IT'S A LARGE EFFORT IT'S ALL AT NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER
JoelLevine_2009X@929.09:936.36 AND LET ME CONCLUDE BY SAYING NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD IN KITTYHAWK NORTH CAROLINA
JoelLevine_2009X@936.60:945.37 A LITTLE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO HISTORY WAS MADE WHEN WE HAD THE FIRST POWERED FLIGHT OF AN AIRPLANE ON EARTH WE ARE ON THE VERGE RIGHT NOW
JoelLevine_2009X@945.72:955.36 TO MAKE THE FIRST FLIGHT OF AN AIRPLANE OUTSIDE THE EARTH 'S ATMOSPHERE WE ARE PREPARED TO FLY THIS ON MARS REWRITE THE TEXTBOOK ABOUT MARS
JoelLevine_2009X@955.79:965.59 IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN MORE INFORMATION WE HAVE A WEBSITE THAT DESCRIBES THIS EXCITING AND INTRIGUING MISSION AND WHY WE WANT TO DO IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
