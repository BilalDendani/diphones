TomHoney_2005 IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND I'VE BEEN A PRIEST IN THE CHURCH FOR TWENTY YEARS FOR MOST OF THAT TIME
TomHoney_2005 I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING AND GRAPPLING WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD WHO IS GOD
TomHoney_2005 AND I'M VERY AWARE THAT WHEN YOU SAY THE WORD GOD MANY PEOPLE WILL TURN OFF IMMEDIATELY
TomHoney_2005 A CELESTIAL CONTROLLER A RULEMAKER A POLICEMAN IN THE SKY WHO ORDERS EVERYTHING
TomHoney_2005 AND CAUSES EVERYTHING TO HAPPEN HE WILL PROTECT HIS OWN PEOPLE AND ANSWER THE PRAYERS OF THE FAITHFUL
TomHoney_2005 AND IN THE WORSHIP OF MY CHURCH THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED ADJECTIVE ABOUT GOD IS ALMIGHTY
TomHoney_2005 BUT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT I HAVE BECOME MORE AND MORE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS PERCEPTION OF GOD OVER THE YEARS
TomHoney_2005 DO WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT GOD IS THE KIND OF MALE BOSS THAT WE'VE BEEN PRESENTING IN OUR WORSHIP AND IN OUR LITURGIES OVER ALL THESE YEARS
TomHoney_2005 OF COURSE THERE HAVE BEEN THINKERS WHO HAVE SUGGESTED DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT GOD EXPLORING THE FEMININE NURTURING SIDE OF DIVINITY
TomHoney_2005 ACKNOWLEDGING THAT GOD IS UNKNOWN AND UNKNOWABLE BY DEFINITION FINDING DEEP RESONANCES WITH OTHER RELIGIONS AND PHILOSOPHIES
TomHoney_2005 AND WAYS OF LOOKING AT LIFE AS PART OF WHAT IS A UNIVERSAL AND GLOBAL SEARCH FOR MEANING
TomHoney_2005 BEEN RELUCTANT TO AIR THEM FOR FEAR OF CREATING TENSION AND DIVISION IN OUR CHURCH COMMUNITIES
TomHoney_2005 FOR FEAR OF UPSETTING THE SIMPLE FAITH OF MORE TRADITIONAL BELIEVERS I HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO ROCK THE BOAT
TomHoney_2005 THEN ON DECEMBER TWENTY SIXTH LAST YEAR JUST TWO MONTHS AGO THAT UNDERWATER EARTHQUAKE TRIGGERED THE TSUNAMI
TomHoney_2005 AND TWO WEEKS LATER SUNDAY MORNING NINTH JANUARY I FOUND MYSELF STANDING IN FRONT OF MY CONGREGATION INTELLIGENT WELL MEANING MOSTLY THOUGHTFUL CHRISTIAN
TomHoney_2005 AND I NEEDED TO EXPRESS ON THEIR BEHALF OUR FEELINGS AND OUR QUESTIONS I HAD MY OWN PERSONAL RESPONSES BUT I ALSO
TomHoney_2005 HAVE A PUBLIC ROLE AND SOMETHING NEEDED TO BE SAID AND THIS IS WHAT I SAID
TomHoney_2005 THE ESSENCE OF WHAT HE SAID WAS THIS THE PEOPLE MOST AFFECTED BY THE DEVASTATION AND LOSS OF LIFE
TomHoney_2005 DO NOT WANT INTELLECTUAL THEORIES ABOUT HOW GOD LET THIS HAPPEN
TomHoney_2005 HE WROTE IF SOME RELIGIOUS GENIUS DID COME UP WITH AN EXPLANATION OF EXACTLY WHY ALL THESE DEATHS MADE SENSE
TomHoney_2005 WE FEEL HAPPIER OR SAFER OR MORE CONFIDENT IN GOD
TomHoney_2005 IF THE MAN IN THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT APPEARED IN THE NEWSPAPERS HOLDING THE HAND OF HIS DEAD CHILD WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF US
TomHoney_2005 NOW THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT WE COULD SAY TO HIM A VERBAL RESPONSE WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE THE ONLY APPROPRIATE RESPONSE WOULD BE
TomHoney_2005 A COMPASSIONATE SILENCE AND SOME KIND OF PRACTICAL HELP IT ISN'T A TIME FOR EXPLANATION OR PREACHING OR THEOLOGY IT'S A TIME FOR
TomHoney_2005 THIS IS TRUE AND YET HERE WE ARE MY CHURCH IN OXFORD SEMI DETACHED FROM EVENTS
TomHoney_2005 THAT HAPPENED A LONG WAY AWAY BUT WITH OUR FAITH BRUISED AND WE WANT AN EXPLANATION FROM GOD WE DEMAND AN EXPLANATION FROM GOD
TomHoney_2005 SOME HAVE CONCLUDED THAT WE CAN ONLY BELIEVE IN A GOD WHO SHARES OUR PAIN
TomHoney_2005 IN SOME WAY GOD MUST FEEL THE ANGUISH AND GRIEF AND PHYSICAL PAIN THAT WE FEEL IN SOME WAY
TomHoney_2005 THE ETERNAL GOD MUST BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO THE SOULS OF HUMAN BEINGS AND EXPERIENCE THE TORMENT WITHIN
TomHoney_2005 AND IF THIS IS TRUE IT MUST ALSO BE THAT GOD KNOWS THE JOY AND EXALTATION OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT AS WELL
TomHoney_2005 WE WANT A GOD WHO CAN WEEP WITH THOSE WHO WEEP AND REJOICE WITH THOSE WHO REJOICE
TomHoney_2005 THIS SEEMS TO ME BOTH A DEEPLY MOVING AND A CONVINCING RE STATEMENT OF CHRISTIAN BELIEF ABOUT GOD
TomHoney_2005 HUNDREDS OF YEARS THE PREVAILING ORTHODOXY THE ACCEPTED TRUTH WAS THAT GOD THE FATHER THE CREATOR IS UNCHANGING
TomHoney_2005 AND THEREFORE BY DEFINITION CANNOT FEEL PAIN OR SADNESS NOW THE UNCHANGING GOD FEELS A BIT COLD AND INDIFFERENT TO ME
TomHoney_2005 AND THE DEVASTATING EVENTS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY HAVE FORCED PEOPLE TO QUESTION THE COLD UNFEELING GOD
TomHoney_2005 THE SLAUGHTER OF MILLIONS IN THE TRENCHES AND IN THE DEATH CAMPS HAVE CAUSED PEOPLE TO ASK
TomHoney_2005 IS GOD IN ALL THIS WHO IS GOD IN ALL THIS AND THE ANSWER WAS GOD IS IN THIS WITH US OR GOD DOESN'T DESERVE OUR ALLEGIANCE ANYMORE
TomHoney_2005 IF GOD IS A BYSTANDER OBSERVING BUT NOT INVOLVED THEN GOD MAY WELL EXIST BUT WE DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT
TomHoney_2005 MANY JEWS AND CHRISTIANS NOW FEEL LIKE THIS I KNOW AND I AM AMONG THEM
TomHoney_2005 SO WE HAVE A SUFFERING GOD A GOD WHO IS INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH THIS WORLD AND WITH EVERY LIVING SOUL I VERY MUCH RELATE TO THIS IDEA OF GOD
TomHoney_2005 BUT IT ISN'T ENOUGH I NEED TO ASK SOME MORE QUESTIONS AND I HOPE THEY ARE QUESTIONS THAT YOU WILL WANT TO ASK AS WELL SOME OF YOU
TomHoney_2005 OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS I HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT WORDS IN OUR WORSHIP HAVE FELT A BIT INAPPROPRIATE A BIT DODGY
TomHoney_2005 WE HAVE A PRAM SERVICE ON TUESDAY MORNINGS FOR MUMS AND THEIR PRE SCHOOL CHILDREN AND LAST WEEK WE SANG WITH THE CHILDREN ONE OF THEIR FAVORITE SONGS THE WISE MAN BUILT HIS HOUSE UPON THE ROCK PERHAPS SOME OF YOU KNOW IT
TomHoney_2005 SOME OF THE WORDS GO LIKE THIS THE FOOLISH MAN BUILT HIS HOUSE UPON THE SAND AND THE FLOODS CAME UP AND THE HOUSE ON THE SAND WENT CRASH
TomHoney_2005 THEN IN THE SAME WEEK AT A FUNERAL WE SANG THE FAMILIAR HYMN WE PLOW THE FIELDS AND SCATTER A VERY ENGLISH HYMN IN THE SECOND VERSE COMES THE LINE THE WIND AND WAVES OBEY HIM
TomHoney_2005 I DON'T FEEL WE CAN SING THAT SONG AGAIN IN CHURCH AFTER WHAT'S HAPPENED SO THE FIRST BIG QUESTION IS ABOUT CONTROL
TomHoney_2005 DOES GOD HAVE A PLAN FOR EACH OF US IS GOD IN CONTROL DOES GOD ORDER EACH MOMENT
TomHoney_2005 DOES THE WIND AND THE WAVES OBEY HIM
TomHoney_2005 FROM TIME TO TIME ONE HEARS CHRISTIANS TELLING THE STORY OF HOW GOD ORGANIZED THINGS FOR THEM SO THAT EVERYTHING WORKED OUT ALL RIGHT SOME DIFFICULTY OVERCOME SOME ILLNESS CURED SOME TROUBLE AVERTED
TomHoney_2005 A PARKING SPACE FOUND AT A CRUCIAL TIME I CAN REMEMBER SOMEONE SAYING THIS TO ME
TomHoney_2005 SHINING WITH ENTHUSIASM AT THIS WONDERFUL CONFIRMATION OF HER FAITH AND THE GOODNESS OF GOD
TomHoney_2005 BUT IF GOD CAN OR WILL DO THESE THINGS INTERVENE TO CHANGE THE FLOW OF EVENTS THEN SURELY HE COULD HAVE STOPPED THE TSUNAMI
TomHoney_2005 DO WE HAVE A LOCAL GOD WHO CAN DO LITTLE THINGS LIKE PARKING SPACES BUT NOT BIG THINGS LIKE FIVE HUNDRED MILE PER HOUR WAVES
TomHoney_2005 THAT'S JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE TO INTELLIGENT CHRISTIANS AND WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE IT EITHER GOD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TSUNAMI OR GOD IS NOT IN CONTROL
TomHoney_2005 SO THAT THEY WERE STILL OUT OF HARM 'S WAY WHEN THE WAVE STRUCK AFTERWARDS SOMEONE SAID THAT GOD MUST HAVE BEEN LOOKING AFTER THEM
TomHoney_2005 SO THE NEXT QUESTION IS ABOUT PARTIALITY CAN WE EARN GOD 'S FAVOR BY WORSHIPPING HIM OR BELIEVING IN HIM DOES GOD DEMAND LOYALTY LIKE ANY MEDIEVAL TYRANT
TomHoney_2005 A GOD WHO LOOKS AFTER HIS OWN SO THAT CHRISTIANS ARE OK WHILE EVERYONE ELSE PERISHES A COSMIC US
TomHoney_2005 AND A GOD WHO IS GUILTY OF THE WORST KIND OF FAVORITISM THAT WOULD BE APPALLING
TomHoney_2005 AND THAT WOULD BE THE POINT AT WHICH I WOULD HAND IN MY MEMBERSHIP SUCH A GOD WOULD BE MORALLY INFERIOR TO THE HIGHEST IDEALS OF HUMANITY
TomHoney_2005 SO WHO IS GOD IF NOT THE GREAT PUPPET MASTER OR THE TRIBAL PROTECTOR
TomHoney_2005 PERHAPS BUT THESE IDEAS ARE ALL JUST VARIATIONS ON GOD CONTROLLING EVERYTHING
TomHoney_2005 THE SUPREME COMMANDER TOYING WITH EXPENDABLE UNITS IN A GREAT CAMPAIGN WE ARE STILL LEFT WITH A GOD WHO CAN DO THE TSUNAMI AND ALLOW AUSCHWITZ
TomHoney_2005 IN HIS GREAT NOVEL THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV DOSTOEVSKY GIVES THESE WORDS TO IVAN ADDRESSED TO HIS NAIVE AND DEVOUT YOUNGER BROTHER
TomHoney_2005 IF THE SUFFERINGS OF CHILDREN GO TO MAKE UP THE SUM OF SUFFERINGS WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE PURCHASE OF TRUTH
TomHoney_2005 THEN I SAY BEFOREHAND THAT THE ENTIRE TRUTH IS NOT WORTH SUCH A PRICE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY SO MUCH FOR ADMISSION
TomHoney_2005 IT IS NOT GOD THAT I DO NOT ACCEPT I MERELY MOST RESPECTFULLY RETURN HIM THE TICKET
TomHoney_2005 OR PERHAPS GOD SET THE WHOLE UNIVERSE GOING AT THE BEGINNING AND THEN RELINQUISHED CONTROL FOREVER SO THAT NATURAL PROCESSES COULD OCCUR AND EVOLUTION RUN ITS COURSE
TomHoney_2005 THIS SEEMS MORE ACCEPTABLE BUT IT STILL LEAVES GOD WITH THE ULTIMATE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY
TomHoney_2005 IS GOD A COLD UNFEELING SPECTATOR OR A POWERLESS LOVER WATCHING WITH INFINITE COMPASSION THINGS GOD IS UNABLE TO CONTROL OR CHANGE
TomHoney_2005 IS GOD INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN OUR SUFFERING SO THAT HE FEELS IT IN HIS OWN BEING
TomHoney_2005 IF WE BELIEVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS WE MUST LET GO OF THE PUPPET MASTER COMPLETELY TAKE OUR LEAVE OF THE ALMIGHTY CONTROLLER ABANDON TRADITIONAL
TomHoney_2005 WE MUST THINK AGAIN ABOUT GOD MAYBE GOD DOESN'T DO THINGS AT ALL MAYBE GOD ISN'T AN AGENT LIKE ALL OF US ARE AGENTS
TomHoney_2005 BY HIS MIGHTY ACTS BUT WHAT IF GOD DOESN'T ACT WHAT IF GOD DOESN'T DO THINGS
TomHoney_2005 COMPASSIONATE PRESENCE UNDERPINNING AND SUSTAINING ALL THINGS WHAT IF GOD IS IN THINGS IN THE
TomHoney_2005 IN THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTION IN THE INCREDIBLE INTRICACY AND MAGNIFICENCE OF THE NATURAL WORLD IN THE COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS THE SOUL OF THE HUMAN RACE
TomHoney_2005 IN YOU IN
TomHoney_2005 MIND AND BODY AND SPIRIT IN THE TSUNAMI IN THE VICTIMS IN THE DEPTH OF THINGS
TomHoney_2005 IN PRESENCE AND IN ABSENCE IN SIMPLICITY AND COMPLEXITY IN CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH HOW DOES THIS IN NESS THIS INNERNESS THIS INTERIORITY OF GOD WORK
TomHoney_2005 IT'S HARD TO CONCEIVE AND BEGS MORE QUESTIONS IS GOD JUST ANOTHER NAME FOR THE UNIVERSE WITH NO INDEPENDENT EXISTENCE
TomHoney_2005 TO WHAT EXTENT CAN WE ASCRIBE PERSONALITY TO GOD
TomHoney_2005 IN THE END WE HAVE TO SAY I DON'T KNOW IF WE KNEW GOD WOULD NOT BE GOD
TomHoney_2005 TO HAVE FAITH IN THIS GOD WOULD BE MORE LIKE TRUSTING AN ESSENTIAL BENEVOLENCE IN THE UNIVERSE AND LESS LIKE BELIEVING A SYSTEM OF DOCTRINAL STATEMENTS
TomHoney_2005 IRONIC THAT CHRISTIANS WHO CLAIM TO BELIEVE IN AN INFINITE UNKNOWABLE BEING THEN TIE GOD DOWN IN CLOSED SYSTEMS AND RIGID DOCTRINES
TomHoney_2005 HOW COULD ONE PRACTICE SUCH A FAITH BY SEEKING THE GOD WITHIN BY CULTIVATING MY OWN INWARDNESS IN SILENCE IN MEDITATION
TomHoney_2005 IN MY INNER SPACE IN THE ME THAT REMAINS WHEN I GENTLY PUT ASIDE MY PASSING EMOTIONS AND IDEAS AND PREOCCUPATIONS
TomHoney_2005 IN AWARENESS OF THE INNER CONVERSATION AND HOW WOULD WE LIVE SUCH A FAITH HOW WOULD I LIVE SUCH A FAITH
TomHoney_2005 BY SEEKING INTIMATE CONNECTION WITH YOUR INWARDNESS THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIPS WHEN DEEP SPEAKS TO DEEP
TomHoney_2005 IF GOD IS IN ALL PEOPLE THEN THERE IS A MEETING PLACE WHERE MY RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU BECOMES A THREE WAY ENCOUNTER
TomHoney_2005 THERE IS AN INDIAN GREETING WHICH I'M SURE SOME OF YOU KNOW NAMASTE ACCOMPANIED BY A RESPECTFUL BOW
TomHoney_2005 WHICH ROUGHLY TRANSLATED MEANS THAT WHICH IS OF GOD IN ME GREETS THAT WHICH OF GOD IS IN YOU
TomHoney_2005 AND HOW WOULD ONE DEEPEN SUCH A FAITH BY SEEKING THE INWARDNESS WHICH IS IN ALL THINGS IN MUSIC AND POETRY IN THE NATURAL WORLD OF BEAUTY
TomHoney_2005 AND IN THE SMALL ORDINARY THINGS OF LIFE THERE IS A DEEP INDWELLING PRESENCE THAT MAKES THEM EXTRAORDINARY
TomHoney_2005 IT NEEDS A PROFOUND ATTENTIVENESS AND A PATIENT WAITING A CONTEMPLATIVE ATTITUDE
TomHoney_2005 AND A GENEROSITY AND OPENNESS TO THOSE WHOSE EXPERIENCE IS DIFFERENT FROM MY
TomHoney_2005 WHEN I STOOD UP TO SPEAK TO MY PEOPLE ABOUT GOD AND THE TSUNAMI I HAD NO ANSWERS TO OFFER THEM NO NEAT PACKAGES OF FAITH
TomHoney_2005 WITH BIBLE REFERENCES TO PROVE THEM ONLY DOUBTS AND QUESTIONING AND UNCERTAINTY
TomHoney_2005 I HAD SOME SUGGESTIONS TO MAKE POSSIBLE NEW WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT GOD WAYS THAT MIGHT ALLOW US TO GO ON DOWN A NEW AND UNCHARTED ROAD
TomHoney_2005 BUT IN THE END THE ONLY THING I COULD SAY FOR SURE WAS I DON'T KNOW AND THAT JUST MIGHT BE THE MOST PROFOUNDLY RELIGIOUS STATEMENT OF ALL
TomHoney_2005 THANK YOU
