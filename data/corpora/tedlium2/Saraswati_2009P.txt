Saraswati_2009P AFFORD TO DOUBT THE PERSON
Saraswati_2009P WHO TENDS THE CHILD IT HAS TO TOTALLY SURRENDER
Saraswati_2009P TOTALLY SURRENDER THAT IMPLIES A LOT OF TRUST
Saraswati_2009P THAT IMPLIES THE TRUSTED PERSON WON 'T VIOLATE THE TRUST
Saraswati_2009P AS THE CHILD GROWS IT BEGINS TO DISCOVER THAT THE PERSON TRUSTED
Saraswati_2009P IS VIOLATING THE TRUST IT DOESN'T KNOW EVEN THE WORD VIOLATION
Saraswati_2009P THEREFORE IT HAS TO
Saraswati_2009P MORE DIFFICULT TO REALLY RESOLVE THE WORDLESS SELF BLAME
Saraswati_2009P THE CHILD GROWS TO BECOME AN ADULT
Saraswati_2009P SO FAR IT HAS BEEN A CONSUMER
Saraswati_2009P BUT THE GROWTH OF A HUMAN BEING LIES IN
Saraswati_2009P CAPACITY TO
Saraswati_2009P CANNOT CONTRIBUTE UNLESS ONE FEELS SECURE ONE
Saraswati_2009P ONE FEELS I HAVE ENOUGH
Saraswati_2009P TO BE COMPASSIONATE IS NOT A JOKE IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE ONE HAS TO DISCOVER
Saraswati_2009P A CERTAIN BIGNESS IN ONESELF THAT BIGNESS SHOULD BE CENTERED ON ONESELF NOT IN TERMS OF MONEY NOT IN TERMS OF POWER YOU
Saraswati_2009P NOT IN TERMS OF ANY STATUS THAT YOU CAN COMMAND IN THE SOCIETY
Saraswati_2009P BUT IT SHOULD BE CENTERED ON ONESELF THE SELF YOU ARE

Saraswati_2009P IS SOMETHING YOU DISCOVER IT'S NOT AN ACTION
Saraswati_2009P BUT IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IT IS ALSO AN ACTION
Saraswati_2009P SO ONE HAS GOT TO DISCOVER A CERTAIN WHOLENESS
Saraswati_2009P I AM GOING TO CITE THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING
Saraswati_2009P WHICH IS WITHIN OUR EXPERIENCE EVERYBODY 'S EXPERIENCE
Saraswati_2009P IN SPITE OF A VERY TRAGIC LIFE
Saraswati_2009P ONE IS HAPPY IN MOMENTS WHICH ARE VERY FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AND THE ONE WHO IS HAPPY
Saraswati_2009P SLAPSTICK JOKE
Saraswati_2009P ACCEPTS HIMSELF AND ALSO THE SCHEME OF THINGS IN WHICH ONE FINDS
Saraswati_2009P THAT MEANS THE WHOLE UNIVERSE KNOWN THINGS AND UNKNOWN THINGS
Saraswati_2009P ALL OF THEM ARE TOTALLY ACCEPTED
Saraswati_2009P AND THE OBJECT THE SCHEME OF THINGS FUSE INTO

Saraswati_2009P IN SPITE OF ALL YOUR LIMITATIONS ALL YOUR WANTS DESIRES UNFULFILLED AND
Saraswati_2009P AND
Saraswati_2009P AND FINALLY BALDNESS
Saraswati_2009P YOU CAN BE HAPPY BUT THE
Saraswati_2009P THE LOGIC IS THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO FULFILL YOUR DESIRE TO BE
Saraswati_2009P YOU ARE THE VERY HAPPINESS THE WHOLENESS THAT YOU WANT TO BE THERE'S NO CHOICE IN THIS THAT ONLY
Saraswati_2009P THE WHOLENESS CANNOT BE DIFFERENT FROM YOU CANNOT BE MINUS YOU
Saraswati_2009P IT HAS GOT TO BE YOU YOU CANNOT BE A PART OF WHOLENESS AND STILL BE

Saraswati_2009P RELATE TO THE WORLD THE DYNAMIC MANIFESTATION OF THE WHOLENESS IS WHAT WE SAY
Saraswati_2009P BECOMES COMPASSION
Saraswati_2009P IF THE OBJECT THAT YOU RELATE TO
Saraswati_2009P THAT
