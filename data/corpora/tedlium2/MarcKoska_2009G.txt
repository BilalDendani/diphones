MarcKoska_2009G@16.49:30.14 AND A QUARTER YEARS AGO I READ A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE WHICH SAID THAT ONE DAY SYRINGES WOULD BE ONE OF THE MAJOR CAUSES OF THE SPREAD OF AIDS THE TRANSMISSION OF AIDS I THOUGHT THIS WAS UNACCEPTABLE SO I DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
MarcKoska_2009G@30.78:39.74 SADLY IT'S COME TRUE MALARIA AS WE ALL KNOW KILLS APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR THE REUSE OF SYRINGES NOW EXCEEDS THAT AND KILLS
MarcKoska_2009G@40.28:43.53 ONE POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR
MarcKoska_2009G@44.10:51.78 THIS YOUNG GIRL AND HER FRIEND THAT I MET IN AN ORPHANAGE IN DELHI WERE HIV POSITIVE FROM A SYRINGE
MarcKoska_2009G@52.47:61.18 AND WHAT WAS SO SAD ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR STORY WAS THAT ONCE THEIR PARENTS HAD FOUND OUT AND DON'T FORGET THEIR PARENTS TOOK THEM TO THE DOCTOR
MarcKoska_2009G@62.78:72.61 THE PARENTS THREW THEM OUT ON THE STREET AND HENCE THEY ENDED UP IN AN ORPHANAGE AND IT COMES FROM SITUATIONS LIKE THIS WHERE YOU HAVE EITHER SKILLED OR UNSKILLED PRACTITIONERS
MarcKoska_2009G@73.23:83.79 BLINDLY GIVING AN INJECTION TO SOMEONE AND THE INJECTION IS SO VALUABLE THAT THE PEOPLE BASICALLY TRUST THE DOCTOR BEING SECOND TO GOD WHICH I'VE HEARD MANY TIMES
MarcKoska_2009G@84.14:92.40 TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT IN FACT THEY'RE NOT AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND OBVIOUSLY THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM BETWEEN PEOPLE IN HIGH VIRUS AREAS
MarcKoska_2009G@92.78:103.65 THIS VIDEO WE TOOK UNDERCOVER WHICH SHOWS YOU OVER A HALF AN HOUR PERIOD A TRAY OF MEDICINES OF FORTY TWO VIALS WHICH ARE BEING DELIVERED WITH ONLY TWO SYRINGES IN A PUBLIC HOSPITAL
MarcKoska_2009G@103.96:110.68 IN INDIA AND OVER THE COURSE OF HALF AN HOUR NOT ONE SYRINGE WAS FILMED BEING UNWRAPPED THEY STARTED WITH TWO AND
MarcKoska_2009G@125.20:132.69 SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE SCALE OF THIS PROBLEM AND IN FACT IN INDIA ALONE SIXTY TWO PERCENT OF ALL INJECTIONS GIVEN ARE UNSAFE
MarcKoska_2009G@133.31:146.52 THESE KIDS IN PAKISTAN DON'T GO TO SCHOOL THEY ARE LUCKY THEY ALREADY HAVE A JOB AND THAT JOB IS THAT THEY GO AROUND AND PICK UP SYRINGES FROM THE BACK OF HOSPITALS WASH THEM AND IN THE COURSE OF THIS OBVIOUSLY PICKING THEM UP THEY INJURE THEMSELVES
MarcKoska_2009G@146.84:154.21 AND THEN THEY REPACKAGE THEM AND SELL THEM OUT ON MARKETS FOR LITERALLY MORE MONEY THAN A STERILE SYRINGE IN THE FIRST PLACE WHICH IS QUITE BIZARRE
MarcKoska_2009G@154.68:162.05 AN INTERESTING PHOTO THEIR FATHER WHILE WE WERE TALKING TO HIM PICKED UP A SYRINGE AND PRICKED HIS FINGER I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU CAN SEE THE DROP OF BLOOD ON THE END
MarcKoska_2009G@162.72:173.70 AND IMMEDIATELY WHIPPED OUT A BOX OF MATCHES LIT ONE AND BURNED THE BLOOD OFF THE END OF HIS FINGER GIVING ME FULL ASSURANCE THAT THAT WAS THE WAY THAT YOU STOPPED THE TRANSMISSION OF HIV
MarcKoska_2009G@174.91:187.64 IN CHINA RECYCLING IS A MAJOR ISSUE AND THEY ARE COLLECTED EN MASS YOU CAN SEE THE SCALE OF IT HERE AND SORTED OUT BY HAND BACK INTO THE RIGHT SIZES AND THEN PUT BACK OUT ON THE STREET
MarcKoska_2009G@188.12:200.86 SO RECYCLING AND REUSE ARE THE MAJOR ISSUES HERE BUT THERE WAS ONE INTERESTING ANECDOTE THAT I FOUND IN INDONESIA IN ALL SCHOOLS IN INDONESIA THERE IS USUALLY A TOY SELLER IN THE PLAYGROUND THE TOY SELLER
MarcKoska_2009G@201.21:206.77 IN THIS CASE HAD SYRINGES WHICH THEY USUALLY DO NEXT DOOR TO THE DIGGERS WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT
MarcKoska_2009G@207.07:214.85 AND THEY USE THEM IN THE BREAKS FOR WATER PISTOLS THEY SQUIRT THEM AT EACH OTHER WHICH IS LOVELY AND INNOCENT AND THEY ARE HAVING GREAT FUN BUT THEY ALSO DRINK FROM
MarcKoska_2009G@216.32:230.46 IN THEIR BREAKS BECAUSE IT'S HOT AND THEY SQUIRT THE WATER INTO THEIR MOUTHS AND THESE ARE USED WITH TRACES OF BLOOD VISIBLE SO WE NEED A BETTER PRODUCT AND WE NEED BETTER INFORMATION AND I THINK IF I CAN JUST BORROW THIS CAMERA
MarcKoska_2009G@232.05:235.52 I WAS GOING TO SHOW YOU MY INVENTION WHICH I CAME UP WITH
MarcKoska_2009G@237.40:245.45 SO IT'S A NORMAL LOOKING SYRINGE YOU LOAD IT UP IN THE NORMAL WAY THIS IS MADE ON EXISTING EQUIPMENT IN FOURTEEN FACTORIES THAT WE LICENSE
MarcKoska_2009G@245.79:253.49 YOU GIVE THE INJECTION AND THEN PUT IT DOWN IF SOMEONE THEN TRIES TO REUSE IT IT LOCKS AND BREAKS AFTERWARDS IT'S VERY VERY SIMPLE
MarcKoska_2009G@258.63:269.51 AS A NORMAL SYRINGE AND IN COMPARISON A COCA COLA IS TEN TIMES THE PRICE AND THAT WILL STOP REUSING A SYRINGE TWENTY OR THIRTY TIMES AND I HAVE AN INFORMATION CHARITY WHICH HAS
MarcKoska_2009G@270.48:278.43 HUGE SCALE AMOUNT OF WORK IN INDIA AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF GIVING INFORMATION TO PEOPLE SO THAT LITTLE KIDS LIKE THIS DON'T DO STUPID THINGS THANK
