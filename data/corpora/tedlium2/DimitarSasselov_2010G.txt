DimitarSasselov_2010G@16.32:16.68 WELL
DimitarSasselov_2010G@17.16:26.64 VERY VERY LUCKY MY TALK ESSENTIALLY GOT WRITTEN BY THREE HISTORIC EVENTS THAT HAPPENED WITHIN DAYS OF EACH OTHER IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS
DimitarSasselov_2010G@27.12:35.67 SEEMINGLY UNRELATED BUT AS YOU WILL SEE ACTUALLY ALL HAVING TO DO WITH THE STORY I WANT TO TELL YOU TODAY THE FIRST WAS ACTUALLY A FUNERAL
DimitarSasselov_2010G@36.33:48.36 TO BE MORE PRECISE A REBURIAL ON MAY TWENTY TWO ND THERE WAS A HERO 'S REBURIAL IN FROMBORK POLAND OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY ASTRONOMER WHO ACTUALLY CHANGED THE WORLD
DimitarSasselov_2010G@48.72:56.27 HE DID THAT LITERALLY BY REPLACING THE EARTH WITH THE SUN IN THE CENTER OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THEN
DimitarSasselov_2010G@56.48:65.13 WITH THIS SIMPLE LOOKING ACT HE ACTUALLY LAUNCHED A SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION WHICH MANY CALL THE COPERNICAN REVOLUTION
DimitarSasselov_2010G@65.88:74.40 NOW THAT WAS IRONICALLY AND VERY BEFITTINGLY THE WAY WE FOUND HIS GRAVE AS IT WAS THE CUSTOM OF THE TIME
DimitarSasselov_2010G@84.71:92.84 DNA ANALYSIS ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF THE SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION OF THE LAST FOUR HUNDRED YEARS THAT HE STARTED
DimitarSasselov_2010G@93.39:101.54 WAS THE WAY WE FOUND WHICH SET OF BONES ACTUALLY BELONGED TO THE PERSON WHO READ ALL THOSE ASTRONOMICAL BOOKS
DimitarSasselov_2010G@102.03:110.25 WHICH WERE FILLED WITH LEFTOVER HAIR THAT WAS COPERNICUS HAIR OBVIOUSLY NOT MANY OTHER PEOPLE BOTHERED TO READ THESE BOOKS LATER ON
DimitarSasselov_2010G@110.75:118.06 THAT MATCH WAS UNAMBIGUOUS THE DNA MATCHED AND WE KNOW THAT THIS WAS INDEED NICOLAUS COPERNICUS
DimitarSasselov_2010G@118.54:132.12 NOW THE CONNECTION BETWEEN BIOLOGY AND DNA AND LIFE IS VERY TANTALIZING WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT COPERNICUS BECAUSE EVEN BACK THEN HIS FOLLOWERS VERY QUICKLY MADE THE LOGICAL STEP
DimitarSasselov_2010G@132.48:140.46 TO ASK IF THE EARTH IS JUST A PLANET THEN WHAT ABOUT PLANETS AROUND OTHER STARS WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA OF THE PLURALITY OF THE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@141.28:152.02 ABOUT LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS IN FACT I'M BORROWING HERE FROM ONE OF THOSE VERY POPULAR BOOKS OF THE TIME AND AT THE TIME PEOPLE ACTUALLY ANSWERED THAT QUESTION POSITIVELY YES
DimitarSasselov_2010G@152.92:165.98 BUT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE AND HERE BEGINS FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF FRUSTRATION OF UNFULFILLED DREAMS THE DREAMS OF GALILEO GIORDANO BRUNO MANY OTHERS
DimitarSasselov_2010G@166.56:176.03 WHICH NEVER LED TO THE ANSWER OF THOSE VERY BASIC QUESTIONS WHICH HUMANITY HAS ASKED ALL THE TIME WHAT IS LIFE WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF LIFE ARE WE ALONE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@176.74:186.99 AND THAT ESPECIALLY HAPPENED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AT THE END OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WHEN THE BEAUTIFUL DEVELOPMENTS DUE TO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY UNDERSTANDING THE CODE OF LIFE DNA
DimitarSasselov_2010G@187.49:195.70 ALL OF THAT SEEMED TO ACTUALLY PUT US NOT CLOSER BUT FURTHER APART FROM ANSWERING THOSE BASIC QUESTIONS
DimitarSasselov_2010G@196.74:208.19 NOW THE GOOD NEWS A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND LET 'S START WITH THE PLANETS LET 'S START WITH THE OLD COPERNICAN QUESTION ARE THERE EARTHS AROUND OTHER STARS
DimitarSasselov_2010G@208.62:216.64 AND AS WE ALREADY HEARD THERE IS A WAY IN WHICH WE ARE TRYING AND NOW ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION
DimitarSasselov_2010G@216.98:225.77 IT'S A NEW TELESCOPE OUR TEAM BEFITTINGLY I THINK NAMED IT AFTER ONE OF THOSE DREAMERS OF THE COPERNICAN TIME JOHANNES KEPLER
DimitarSasselov_2010G@226.26:239.75 AND THAT TELESCOPE 'S SOLE PURPOSE IS TO GO OUT FIND THE PLANETS THAT ORBIT OTHER STARS IN OUR GALAXY AND TELL US HOW OFTEN DO PLANETS LIKE OUR OWN EARTH HAPPEN TO BE OUT THERE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@240.18:249.70 THE TELESCOPE IS ACTUALLY BUILT SIMILARLY TO THE WELL KNOWN TO YOU HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE EXCEPT IT DOES HAVE AN ADDITIONAL LENS A WIDE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@250.32:258.63 FIELD LENS AS YOU WOULD CALL IT AS A PHOTOGRAPHER AND IF IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS YOU WALK OUT IN THE EARLY EVENING AND LOOK STRAIGHT UP
DimitarSasselov_2010G@259.14:271.59 AND PLACE YOU PALM LIKE THIS YOU WILL ACTUALLY BE LOOKING AT THE FIELD OF THE SKY WHERE THIS TELESCOPE IS SEARCHING FOR PLANETS DAY AND NIGHT WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTION FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS
DimitarSasselov_2010G@272.18:280.74 THE WAY WE DO THAT ACTUALLY IS WITH A METHOD WHICH WE CALL THE TRANSIT METHOD IT'S ACTUALLY MINI ECLIPSES THAT OCCUR WHEN A PLANET PASSES IN FRONT OF
DimitarSasselov_2010G@281.80:290.64 NOT ALL OF THE PLANETS WILL BE FORTUTIOUSLY ORIENTED FOR US TO BE ABLE DO THAT BUT IF YOU HAVE A MILLION STARS YOU'LL FIND ENOUGH PLANETS
DimitarSasselov_2010G@291.08:304.96 AND AS YOU SEE ON THIS ANIMATION WHAT KEPLER IS GOING TO DETECT IS JUST THE DIMMING OF THE LIGHT FROM THE STAR WE ARE NOT GOING TO SEE THE IMAGE OF THE STAR AND THE PLANET AS THIS ALL THE STARS FOR KEPLER ARE JUST POINTS OF LIGHT
DimitarSasselov_2010G@305.45:313.18 BUT WE LEARN A LOT FROM THAT NOT ONLY THAT THERE IS A PLANET THERE BUT WE ALSO LEARN ITS SIZE HOW MUCH OF THE LIGHT IS BEING DIMMED DEPENDS ON HOW BIG
DimitarSasselov_2010G@314.92:321.44 IS WE LEARN ABOUT ITS ORBIT THE PERIOD OF ITS ORBIT AND SO ON SO WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED
DimitarSasselov_2010G@322.33:331.30 WELL LET ME TRY TO WALK YOU THROUGH WHAT WE ACTUALLY SEE AND SO YOU UNDERSTAND THE NEWS THAT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU TODAY
DimitarSasselov_2010G@332.35:343.75 WHAT KEPLER DOES IS DISCOVER A LOT OF CANDIDATES WHICH WE THEN FOLLOW UP AND FIND AS PLANETS CONFIRM AS PLANETS IT BASICALLY TELLS US THIS IS THE DISTRIBUTION OF PLANETS IN SIZE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@355.27:368.38 EVEN BACK DURING THE ANCIENTS THE SOLAR SYSTEM IN THAT SENSE WOULD LOOK ON A DIAGRAM LIKE THIS THERE WILL BE THE SMALLER PLANETS AND THERE WILL BE THE BIG PLANETS EVEN BACK TO THE TIME OF EPICURUS AND THEN OR COURSE COPERNICUS
DimitarSasselov_2010G@368.79:376.62 AND HIS FOLLOWERS UP UNTIL RECENTLY THAT WAS THE SOLAR SYSTEM FOUR EARTH LIKE PLANETS WITH SMALL RADIUS SMALLER THAN ABOUT TWO
DimitarSasselov_2010G@377.55:385.75 TIMES THE SIZE OF THE EARTH AND THAT WAS OF COURSE MERCURY VENUS MARS AND OF COURSE THE EARTH AND THEN THE TWO BIG GIANT PLANETS
DimitarSasselov_2010G@386.36:390.58 THEN THE COPERNICAN REVOLUTION BROUGHT IN TELESCOPES AND OF COURSE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@391.33:401.63 MORE PLANETS WERE DISCOVERED NOW THE TOTAL PLANET NUMBER IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM WAS NINE THE SMALL PLANETS DOMINATED AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN HARMONY TO THAT WHICH ACTUALLY COPERNICUS
DimitarSasselov_2010G@401.90:407.85 WAS VERY HAPPY TO NOTE AND KEPLER WAS ONE OF THE BIG PROPONENTS OF SO NOW WE HAVE PLUTO TO JOIN THE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@420.20:426.76 FINALLY FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THE TECHNOLOGY CAME TO THE POINT WHERE WE COULD DISCOVER A PLANET AROUND ANOTHER STAR AND
DimitarSasselov_2010G@427.45:436.19 WE ACTUALLY DID PRETTY WELL IN THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED PLANETS WERE DISCOVERED ORBITING OTHER STARS WITH DIFFERENT METHODS
DimitarSasselov_2010G@451.11:458.07 BUT YOU SEE WE HAVEN'T GONE VERY FAR WE WERE STILL BACK WHERE COPERNICUS WAS WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@458.42:465.64 WHETHER PLANETS LIKE THE EARTH ARE OUT THERE AND WE DO CARE ABOUT PLANETS LIKE THE EARTH BECAUSE BY NOW WE UNDERSTOOD THAT
DimitarSasselov_2010G@466.13:476.32 LIFE AS A CHEMICAL SYSTEM REALLY NEEDS A SMALLER PLANET WITH WATER AND WITH ROCKS AND WITH A LOT OF COMPLEX CHEMISTRY TO ORIGINATE TO EMERGE TO SURVIVE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@477.27:487.80 WE DIDN'T HAVE THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT SO TODAY I'M HERE TO ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A FIRST GLIMPSE OF WHAT THE NEW TELESCOPE KEPLER HAS BEEN ABLE TO TELL US IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS
DimitarSasselov_2010G@488.28:498.77 AND LO AND BEHOLD WE ARE BACK TO THE HARMONY AND TO FULFILLING THE DREAMS OF COPERNICUS YOU CAN SEE HERE THE SMALL PLANETS DOMINATE THE PICTURE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@499.07:508.58 THE PLANETS WHICH ARE MARKED LIKE EARTH DEFINITELY MORE THAN ANY OTHER PLANETS THAT WE SEE AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME WE CAN SAY THAT
DimitarSasselov_2010G@508.92:515.01 THERE IS A LOT MORE WORK WE NEED TO DO WITH THIS MOST OF THESE ARE CANDIDATES IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE WILL CONFIRM THEM
DimitarSasselov_2010G@515.56:524.42 BUT THE STATISTICAL RESULT IS LOUD AND CLEAR AND THE STATISTICAL RESULT IS THAT PLANETS LIKE OUR OWN EARTH
DimitarSasselov_2010G@525.26:536.75 OUT THERE OUR OWN MILKY WAY GALAXY IS RICH IN THIS KIND OF PLANETS SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO WE DO NEXT WELL FIRST OF ALL WE CAN STUDY THEM NOW THAT WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@537.27:549.90 AND WE CAN FIND THOSE THAT WE WOULD CALL HABITABLE MEANING THAT THEY HAVE SIMILAR CONDITIONS TO THE CONDITIONS THAT WE EXPERIENCE HERE ON EARTH AND WHERE A LOT OF COMPLEX CHEMISTRY CAN HAPPEN
DimitarSasselov_2010G@551.53:565.71 WE CAN EVEN PUT A NUMBER TO HOW MANY OF THOSE PLANETS NOW DO WE EXPECT OUR OWN MILKY WAY GALAXY HARBORS AND THE NUMBER AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT IS PRETTY STAGGERING IT'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION SUCH PLANETS
DimitarSasselov_2010G@566.40:575.28 THAT'S GREAT NEWS WHY BECAUSE WITH OUR OWN LITTLE TELESCOPE JUST IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS WE'LL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY AT LEAST SIXTY OF THEM
DimitarSasselov_2010G@575.95:581.95 SO THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE THEN WE CAN GO AND STUDY THEM REMOTELY OF COURSE WITH ALL THE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@592.34:602.86 SEE THAT THAT'S GREAT BUT THAT IS NOT THE WHOLE NEWS THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE WHY I'M HERE IS TO TELL YOU THAT THE NEXT
DimitarSasselov_2010G@604.41:613.28 REALLY THE EXCITING PART THE ONE THAT THIS STEP IS ENABLING US TO DO IS COMING NEXT AND HERE COMES BIOLOGY
DimitarSasselov_2010G@622.15:624.47 DO WE EXPECT IT TO BE LIKE LIFE ON EARTH
DimitarSasselov_2010G@624.90:633.23 AND LET ME IMMEDIATELY TELL YOU HERE WHEN I SAY LIFE I DON'T MEAN DOLCE VITA GOOD LIFE HUMAN LIFE I REALLY MEAN LIFE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@634.08:643.08 ON EARTH PAST AND PRESENT FROM MICROBES TO US HUMANS IN ITS RICH MOLECULAR DIVERSITY THE WAY WE NOW UNDERSTAND LIFE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@643.79:655.29 ON EARTH AS BEING A SET OF MOLECULES AND CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND WE CALL THAT COLLECTIVELY BIOCHEMISTRY LIFE AS A CHEMICAL PROCESS AS A CHEMICAL PHENOMENON
DimitarSasselov_2010G@656.10:664.49 SO THE QUESTION IS IS THAT CHEMICAL PHENOMENON UNIVERSAL OR IS IT SOMETHING WHICH DEPENDS ON THE PLANET
DimitarSasselov_2010G@665.08:677.37 IS IT LIKE GRAVITY WHICH IS THE SAME EVERYWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE OR THERE WOULD BE ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT BIOCHEMISTRIES WHEREVER WE FIND THEM WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR WHEN WE TRY TO DO THAT
DimitarSasselov_2010G@678.22:688.70 AND THAT'S A VERY BASIC QUESTION WHICH WE DON'T KNOW THAT ANSWER TO BUT WHICH WE CAN TRY AND WE ARE TRYING TO ANSWER IN THE LAB WE DON'T NEED TO GO TO SPACE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION
DimitarSasselov_2010G@689.20:699.83 AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO AND THAT'S WHAT MANY PEOPLE NOW ARE TRYING TO DO AND A LOT OF THE GOOD NEWS COMES FROM THAT PART OF THE BRIDGE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO BUILD AS WELL
DimitarSasselov_2010G@700.29:709.11 SO THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE THAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU HERE WHEN WE THINK OF WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR THE PHENOMENON THAT WE CALL LIFE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@709.74:724.25 WE THINK OF COMPARTMENTALIZATION KEEPING THE MOLECULES WHICH ARE IMPORTANT FOR LIFE IN A MEMBRANE ISOLATED FROM THE REST OF THE ENVIRONMENT BUT YET IN AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY ACTUALLY COULD ORIGINATE TOGETHER
DimitarSasselov_2010G@725.39:736.53 IN ONE OF OUR LABS JACK SZOSTAK 'S LABS IT WAS A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS THAT SHOWED THAT THE ENVIRONMENTS WHICH ARE VERY COMMON ON PLANETS
DimitarSasselov_2010G@736.76:744.62 ON CERTAIN TYPES OF PLANETS LIKE THE EARTH WHERE YOU HAVE SOME LIQUID WATER AND SOME CLAYS YOU ACTUALLY END UP WITH
DimitarSasselov_2010G@745.71:757.23 NATURALLY AVAILABLE MOLECULES WHICH SPONTANEOUSLY FORM BUBBLES BUT THOSE BUBBLES HAVE MEMBRANES VERY SIMILAR TO THE MEMBRANE OF EVERY CELL OF EVERY LIVING
DimitarSasselov_2010G@757.97:768.34 ON EARTH LOOKS LIKE LIKE THIS AND THEY REALLY HELP MOLECULES LIKE NUCLEIC ACIDS LIKE RNA AND DNA STAY INSIDE DEVELOP
DimitarSasselov_2010G@768.79:782.58 CHANGE DIVIDE AND DO SOME OF THE PROCESSES THAT WE CALL LIFE NOW THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE TO TELL YOU THE PATHWAY IN WHICH WE ARE TRYING TO ANSWER THAT BIGGER QUESTION ABOUT THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE PHENOMENON
DimitarSasselov_2010G@783.75:793.00 IN A SENSE YOU CAN THINK OF THAT WORK THAT PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO DO NOW AROUND THE WORLD AS BUILDING A BRIDGE BUILDING A BRIDGE FROM TWO SIDES OF THE RIVER
DimitarSasselov_2010G@793.37:800.91 ON ONE HAND ON THE LEFT BANK OF THE RIVER ARE THE PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO STUDY THOSE PLANETS AND TRY TO DEFINE THE ENVIRONMENTS
DimitarSasselov_2010G@801.18:808.32 WE DON'T WANT TO GO BLIND BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MANY POSSIBILITIES AND THERE IS NOT TOO MUCH LAB AND THERE IS NOT ENOUGH HUMAN
DimitarSasselov_2010G@808.97:815.98 TIME TO ACTUALLY TO DO ALL THE EXPERIMENTS SO THAT'S WHAT WE ARE BUILDING FROM THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RIVER FROM THE RIGHT BANK OF THE RIVER
DimitarSasselov_2010G@816.39:824.93 THE EXPERIMENTS IN THE LAB THAT I JUST SHOWED YOU WHERE WE ACTUALLY TRIED THAT AND IT FEEDS BACK AND FORTH AND WE HOPE TO MEET IN THE MIDDLE ONE DAY
DimitarSasselov_2010G@825.37:833.91 SO WHY SHOULD YOU CARE ABOUT THAT WHY AM I TRYING TO SELL YOU A HALF BUILT BRIDGE AM I THAT CHARMING
DimitarSasselov_2010G@835.43:840.77 WELL THERE ARE MANY REASONS AND YOU HEARD SOME OF THEM IN THE SHORT TALK TODAY
DimitarSasselov_2010G@842.98:852.21 OF CHEMISTRY ACTUALLY CAN HELP US WITH OUR DAILY LIVES BUT THERE IS SOMETHING MORE PROFOUND HERE SOMETHING DEEPER AND THAT DEEPER
DimitarSasselov_2010G@853.17:861.30 UNDERLYING POINT IS THAT SCIENCE IS IN THE PROCESS OF REDEFINING LIFE AS WE KNOW IT
DimitarSasselov_2010G@876.26:884.53 TIME NOW IT'S ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE BUT IT'S EQUALLY PROFOUND AND HALF THE TIME WHAT'S HAPPENED
DimitarSasselov_2010G@884.99:894.04 IS IT'S RELATED THIS KIND OF SENSE OF INSIGNIFICANCE TO HUMANKIND TO THE EARTH IN A BIGGER SPACE AND THE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@894.30:896.72 MORE WE LEARN THE MORE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@897.23:904.90 THAT WAS REINFORCED YOU'VE ALL LEARNED THAT IN SCHOOL HOW SMALL THE EARTH IS COMPARED TO THE IMMENSE UNIVERSE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@905.13:916.32 AND THE BIGGER THE TELESCOPE THE BIGGER THAT UNIVERSE BECOMES AND LOOK AT THIS IMAGE OF THE TINY BLUE DOT THIS PIXEL IS THE EARTH IT IS THE EARTH AS WE KNOW IT
DimitarSasselov_2010G@916.88:920.26 IT IS SEEN FROM IN THIS CASE FROM OUTSIDE THE ORBIT
DimitarSasselov_2010G@922.04:926.33 BUT IT'S REALLY TINY WE KNOW THAT LET 'S THINK OF LIFE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@926.74:935.11 AS THAT ENTIRE PLANET BECAUSE IN A SENSE IT IS THE BIOSPHERE IS THE SIZE OF THE EARTH LIFE ON EARTH IS THE SIZE OF THE EARTH
DimitarSasselov_2010G@935.67:943.72 AND LET 'S COMPARE IT TO THE REST OF THE WORLD IN SPACIAL TERMS WHAT IF THAT COPERNICAN
DimitarSasselov_2010G@956.96:964.38 CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW SMALL IT IS LET ME TRY IT OKAY LET 'S SAY THIS IS THE SIZE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@964.83:972.26 OF THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE WITH ALL THE GALAXIES WITH ALL THE STARS OKAY FROM HERE TO HERE
DimitarSasselov_2010G@972.95:981.89 DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE SIZE OF LIFE IN THIS NECKTIE WILL BE IT WILL BE THE SIZE OF A SINGLE SMALL ATOM
DimitarSasselov_2010G@982.58:990.18 IT IS UNIMAGINABLY SMALL WE CAN'T IMAGINE IT I MEAN LOOK YOU CAN SEE THE NECKTIE BUT YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE SEEING
DimitarSasselov_2010G@990.37:1000.79 THE SIZE OF A LITTLE SMALL ATOM BUT THAT'S NOT THE WHOLE STORY YOU SEE THE UNIVERSE AND LIFE ARE BOTH IN SPACE AND TIME
DimitarSasselov_2010G@1008.28:1016.43 LIFE ON EARTH THINK ABOUT THOSE OLDEST LIVING THINGS ON EARTH BUT IN A COSMIC PROPORTION THIS IS NOT
DimitarSasselov_2010G@1018.52:1026.87 THIS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT SO LIFE MIGHT BE INSIGNIFICANT IN SIZE BUT IT IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT IN TIME
DimitarSasselov_2010G@1027.89:1041.16 LIFE AND THE UNIVERSE COMPARE TO EACH OTHER LIKE A CHILD AND A PARENT PARENT AND OFFSPRING SO WHAT DOES THIS TELL US THIS TELLS US THAT THAT INSIGNIFICANCE PARADIGM THAT WE SOMEHOW
DimitarSasselov_2010G@1042.10:1053.33 TO LEARN FROM THE COPERNICAN PRINCIPLE IT'S ALL WRONG THERE IS IMMENSE POWERFUL POTENTIAL IN LIFE IN THIS UNIVERSE ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE KNOW
DimitarSasselov_2010G@1053.73:1062.19 THAT PLACES LIKE THE EARTH ARE COMMON AND THAT POTENTIAL THAT POWERFUL POTENTIAL IS ALSO OUR POTENTIAL
DimitarSasselov_2010G@1062.63:1072.15 OF YOU AND ME AND IF WE ARE TO BE STEWARDS OF OUR PLANET EARTH AND ITS BIOSPHERE WE'D BETTER UNDERSTAND
DimitarSasselov_2010G@1072.82:1084.12 THE COSMIC SIGNIFICANCE AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND THE GOOD NEWS IS WE CAN ACTUALLY INDEED DO IT AND LET 'S DO IT LET 'S START THIS NEW
DimitarSasselov_2010G@1084.89:1091.89 AT THE TAIL END OF THE OLD ONE WITH SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY BEING THE WAY TO TRANSFORM BOTH OUR
