LawrenceLessig_2010X I
LawrenceLessig_2010X ABOUT WHAT WE LEARN FROM CONSERVATIVES
LawrenceLessig_2010X AND I'M AT A STAGE IN LIFE WHERE I'M YEARNING FOR MY OLD DAYS SO I WANT TO CONFESS TO YOU THAT WHEN I WAS A KID
LawrenceLessig_2010X INDEED I WAS A CONSERVATIVE I WAS A YOUNG REPUBLICAN A TEENAGE REPUBLICAN A LEADER IN THE TEENAGE REPUBLICANS INDEED
LawrenceLessig_2010X NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING
LawrenceLessig_2010X YOU'RE THINKING THAT 'S NOT WHAT THE INTERNETS SAY YOU'RE THINKING WIKIPEDIA DOESN'T SAY THIS FACT AND INDEED THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE JUNK THAT FLOWS ACROSS THE TUBES IN THESE INTERNETS HERE WIKIPEDIA
LawrenceLessig_2010X THAT THIS GUY THIS FORMER CONGRESSMAN FROM ERIE PENNSYLVANIA WAS AT THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE OF THE YOUNGEST PEOPLE AT THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION BUT IT'S JUST NOT TRUE
LawrenceLessig_2010X INDEED IT DRIVES ME SO NUTS LET ME JUST CHANGE THIS
LawrenceLessig_2010X SO
LawrenceLessig_2010X LAWRENCE LESSIG RIGHT
LawrenceLessig_2010X FINALLY TRUTH WILL BE BROUGHT HERE OKAY SEE IT'S DONE IT'S ALMOST DONE HERE WE GO YOUNGEST REPUBLICAN OKAY WE'RE FINISHED
LawrenceLessig_2010X THAT'S IT
LawrenceLessig_2010X THEY GO TO CHURCH NOW YOU KNOW I MEAN
LawrenceLessig_2010X INDEED THEY SELL BOOKS ABOUT POTLUCK DINNERS THEY SERVE FOOD TO POOR PEOPLE THEY SHARE THEY GIVE THEY GIVE AWAY FOR FREE AND IT'S THE VERY SAME PEOPLE
LawrenceLessig_2010X WALL ST FIRMS WHO ON SUNDAYS SHOW UP AND SHARE AND NOT ONLY FOOD RIGHT
LawrenceLessig_2010X THESE VERY SAME PEOPLE ARE STRONG BELIEVERS IN LOTS OF
LawrenceLessig_2010X IN THE LIMITS ON THE MARKETS THEY ARE IN MANY IMPORTANT PLACES AGAINST MARKETS
LawrenceLessig_2010X INDEED THEY LIKE ALL OF US CELEBRATE THIS KIND OF RELATIONSHIP BUT THEY'RE VERY KEEN THAT WE DON'T LET MONEY DROP INTO THAT RELATIONSHIP ELSE IT TURNS INTO SOMETHING LIKE THIS
LawrenceLessig_2010X WANT TO REGULATE US THOSE CONSERVATIVES TO STOP US FROM ALLOWING THE MARKET TO SPREAD IN THOSE PLACES BECAUSE THEY
LawrenceLessig_2010X THERE ARE PLACES FOR THE MARKET AND PLACES WHERE THE MARKET SHOULD NOT EXIST WHERE WE SHOULD BE FREE
LawrenceLessig_2010X TO ENJOY THE FELLOWSHIP OF OTHERS THEY RECOGNIZE BOTH OF THESE THINGS HAVE TO LIVE TOGETHER AND
LawrenceLessig_2010X IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WHO TAUGHT US ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL THINKING TEDDY ROOSEVELT THEY FIRST TAUGHT US ABOUT ECOLOGY IN THE CONTEXT OF
LawrenceLessig_2010X NATURAL RESOURCES AND THEN THEY BEGAN TO TEACH US IN THE CONTEXT OF INNOVATION ECONOMICS THEY UNDERSTAND IN THAT CONTEXT FREE THEY UNDERSTAND FREE IS AN IMPORTANT ESSENTIAL
LawrenceLessig_2010X PART OF THE CULTURAL ECOLOGY AS WELL THAT'S THE THING I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT
LawrenceLessig_2010X NOW I KNOW YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME REALLY HERE SO HERE 'S EXHIBIT NUMBER ONE I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU MY LATEST
LawrenceLessig_2010X HERO JULIAN SANCHEZ A LIBERTARIAN WHO WORKS AT THE FOR MANY PEOPLE EVIL CATO INSTITUTE
LawrenceLessig_2010X SO WHAT HE DOES IS HE BEGINS TO TELL US ABOUT THESE
LawrenceLessig_2010X THEY DECIDED THEY WANTED TO DO THE SAME
LawrenceLessig_2010X HE WANTS US TO LEARN FROM THIS HERE 'S LESSON NUMBER ONE
LawrenceLessig_2010X IN THE SENSE THAT THEY'RE EMULATING THE ORIGINAL MASHUP AND THE GUY WHO SHOT IT OBVIOUSLY HAS A STRONG EYE AND SOME EXPERIENCE WITH VIDEO
LawrenceLessig_2010X IS ALSO BASICALLY JUST A GROUP OF FRIENDS HAVING AN AUTHENTIC SOCIAL MOMENT AND SCREWING AROUND TOGETHER IT SHOULD FEEL FAMILIAR AND KIND OF RESONATE FOR ANYONE WHO 'S HAD A SING A LONG OR A DANCE PARTY WITH A GROUP OF GOOD FRIENDS LL OR
LawrenceLessig_2010X SO THAT'S IMPORTANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE EARLIER VIDEOS WE LOOKED AT BECAUSE HERE REMIX ISN'T JUST ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL DOING SOMETHING ALONE IN HIS BASEMENT IT BECOMES AN ACT OF SOCIAL CREATIVITY
LawrenceLessig_2010X AND IT'S NOT JUST THAT IT YIELDS A DIFFERENT KIND OF PRODUCT AT THE END IT'S THAT POTENTIALLY IT CHANGES THE WAY THAT WE RELATE TO EACH OTHER
LawrenceLessig_2010X ALL OF OUR NORMAL SOCIAL INTERACTIONS BECOME A KIND OF INVITATION TO THIS SORT OF COLLECTIVE EXPRESSION IT'S OUR REAL SOCIAL LIVES THEMSELVES THAT ARE TRANSMUTED INTO
LawrenceLessig_2010X AND SO THIS LIBERTARIAN DRAWS FROM THESE TWO
LawrenceLessig_2010X ONE REMIX IS ABOUT INDIVIDUALS USING OUR SHARED CULTURE AS A KIND OF LANGUAGE TO COMMUNICATE SOMETHING TO AN AUDIENCE STAGE TWO SOCIAL REMIX IS REALLY ABOUT USING IT TO MEDIATE PEOPLE 'S RELATIONSHIPS TO EACH
LawrenceLessig_2010X FIRST WITHIN EACH VIDEO THE BRAT PACK CHARACTERS ARE USED AS A KIND OF TEMPLATE FOR PERFORMING THE SOCIAL REALITY OF EACH GROUP
LawrenceLessig_2010X DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE VIDEOS WHERE ONCE THE BASIC STRUCTURE IS ESTABLISHED IT BECOMES A KIND OF PLATFORM FOR ARTICULATING THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GROUPS SOCIAL AND PHYSICAL WORLDS
LawrenceLessig_2010X AND THEN HERE 'S FOR ME THE CRITICAL KEY TO WHAT JULIAN HAS TO SAY
LawrenceLessig_2010X OVER OUR SOCIAL REALITIES SOCIAL REALITIES THAT ARE NOW INEVITABLY PERMEATED BY POP CULTURE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP THESE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF PUBLIC GOODS IN MIND IF WE'RE
LawrenceLessig_2010X ONLY FOCUSED ON HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE SUPPLY OF ONE I THINK WE RISK SUPPRESSING THIS DIFFERENT AND RICHER AND IN SOME WAYS MAYBE EVEN MORE
LawrenceLessig_2010X RIGHT BINGO POINT FREEDOM NEEDS THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BOTH HAVE THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF THE GREAT COMMERCIAL WORKS
LawrenceLessig_2010X THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THIS DIFFERENT KIND OF CULTURE AND FOR THAT TO HAPPEN YOU NEED IDEAS LIKE FAIR USE TO BE CENTRAL AND PROTECTED TO ENABLE THIS KIND OF
LawrenceLessig_2010X GETS THAT CULTURE NOW MY CONCERN IS WE DEMS TOO OFTEN NOT SO MUCH ALL RIGHT TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THIS GREAT COMPANY
LawrenceLessig_2010X IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS WHEN THIS REPUBLICAN RAN THAT COMPANY THEIR GREATEST WORK
LawrenceLessig_2010X WAS WORK THAT BUILT ON THE PAST RIGHT ALL OF THE GREAT DISNEY WORKS WERE WORKS THAT TOOK WORKS THAT WERE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
LawrenceLessig_2010X AND REMIXED THEM OR WAITED UNTIL THEY ENTERED THE PUBLIC DOMAIN TO REMIX THEM TO CELEBRATE THIS ADD ON REMIX CREATIVITY INDEED MICKEY MOUSE HIMSELF OF COURSE
LawrenceLessig_2010X AS STEAMBOAT WILLIE IS A REMIX OF THE THEN VERY DOMINANT VERY POPULAR STEAMBOAT BILL BY BUSTER KEATON THIS MAN
LawrenceLessig_2010X OF CREATIVITY BUT
LawrenceLessig_2010X THE COMPANY PASSES THROUGH THIS DARK STAGE
LawrenceLessig_2010X TO THIS DEMOCRAT WILDLY DIFFERENT THIS IS THE MASTERMIND BEHIND THE EVENTUAL PASSAGE OF WHAT WE CALL THE SONNY BONO COPYRIGHT TERM EXTENSION ACT EXTENDING THE TERM OF EXISTING COPYRIGHTS BY TWENTY
LawrenceLessig_2010X STRIKE IT DOWN WE HAD THE ASSISTANCE OF NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS INCLUDING THIS RIGHT WING NOBEL PRIZE WINNER MILTON FRIEDMAN WHO SAID HE WOULD JOIN OUR BRIEF ONLY IF THE WORD NO BRAINER WAS IN THE
LawrenceLessig_2010X BUT APPARENTLY NO BRAINS EXISTED IN THIS PLACE WHEN DEMOCRATS PASSED AND SIGNED THIS BILL INTO LAW NOW TINY LITTLE
LawrenceLessig_2010X QUIBBLE OF A FOOTNOTE SONNY BONO YOU MIGHT SAY WAS A REPUBLICAN BUT I DON'T BUY IT THIS GUY
LawrenceLessig_2010X SECOND EXAMPLE THINK ABOUT THIS CULTURAL HERO ICON ON THE LEFT
LawrenceLessig_2010X CREATOR OF THIS
LawrenceLessig_2010X HE BUILT STAR WARS MASHUPS INVITING PEOPLE TO COME AND USE THEIR CREATIVE ENERGY TO PRODUCE A NEW GENERATION OF ATTENTION TOWARDS THIS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT CULTURAL ICON READ THE LICENSE
LawrenceLessig_2010X THE LICENSE FOR THESE REMIXERS ASSIGNS ALL OF THE RIGHTS TO THE REMIX BACK TO LUCAS THE MASHUP IS OWNED BY LUCAS INDEED
LawrenceLessig_2010X ANYTHING YOU ADD TO THE MASHUP MUSIC YOU MIGHT ADD LUCAS HAS A WORLDWIDE PERPETUAL RIGHT TO EXPLOIT THAT FOR FREE THERE IS NO
LawrenceLessig_2010X CREATOR HERE TO BE RECOGNIZED THE CREATOR DOESN'T HAVE ANY RIGHTS THE CREATOR IS SHARECROPPER IN THIS STORY AND WE SHOULD REMEMBER WHO EMPLOYED THE SHARECROPPERS THE
LawrenceLessig_2010X STUFF AND NOT A GENERATION OF SHARECROPPERS NOW I THINK THERE ARE LESSONS WE SHOULD LEARN HERE
LawrenceLessig_2010X AND FOR THAT SHARING ACTIVITY TO HAPPEN WE HAVE TO HAVE WELL PROTECTED SPACES OF FAIR USE
LawrenceLessig_2010X THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO THIS ECOLOGY OF SHARING NEEDS FREEDOM WITHIN WHICH TO CREATE
LawrenceLessig_2010X THIS EXPLAINS THE RIGHT WING NON PROFIT CREATIVE COMMONS
LawrenceLessig_2010X SO THAT WE GO FROM A ALL RIGHTS RESERVED WORLD TO A SOME RIGHTS RESERVED WORLD SO THAT PEOPLE CAN KNOW THE FREEDOMS THEY HAVE ATTACHED TO THE CONTENT BUILDING AND CREATING ON THE BASIS OF THIS CREATIVE
LawrenceLessig_2010X AND A FREEDOM TO CREATE WITHOUT REQUIRING PERMISSION FIRST BECAUSE THE PERMISSION HAS ALREADY BEEN GRANTED AND A RESPECT FOR THE CREATOR BECAUSE IT BUILDS UPON
LawrenceLessig_2010X A COPYRIGHT THE CREATOR HAS LICENSED FREELY AND IT EXPLAINS THE VAST RIGHT WING CONSPIRACY THAT'S OBVIOUSLY DEVELOPED AROUND THESE
LawrenceLessig_2010X LICENSES AS NOW MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DIGITAL OBJECTS ARE OUT THERE LICENSED FREELY IN THIS WAY
LawrenceLessig_2010X NOW THAT PICTURE OF AN ECOLOGY OF CREATIVITY THE PICTURE OF AN ECOLOGY OF BALANCED CREATIVITY IS THAT THE ECOLOGY OF CREATIVITY WE HAVE RIGHT NOW
LawrenceLessig_2010X WELL AS YOU ALL KNOW
LawrenceLessig_2010X NOT MANY OF US BELIEVE WE DO I TRIPPED ON THE REALITY OF THIS ECOLOGY OF CREATIVITY JUST LAST WEEK I CREATED A VIDEO WHICH WAS BASED ON A WIRESIDE CHAT THAT I'D GIVEN AND I UPLOADED IT TO YOUTUBE
LawrenceLessig_2010X I THEN GOT THIS EMAIL FROM YOUTUBE WEIRDLY NOTIFYING ME THAT THERE WAS CONTENT IN THAT OWNED BY THE MYSTERIOUS WMG
LawrenceLessig_2010X THAT MATCHED THEIR CONTENT ID SO I DIDN'T THINK MUCH ABOUT IT AND THEN ON TWITTER SOMEBODY SAID TO ME
LawrenceLessig_2010X YOUR TALK ON YOUTUBE WAS DMCA 'D WAS THAT YOUR PURPOSE IMAGINING THAT I HAD THIS DEEP CONSPIRACY TO REVEAL THE OBVIOUS FLAWS IN THE DMCA ANSWERED NO I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT BUT THEN I WENT TO THE SITE AND ALL OF THE AUDIO IN MY SITE HAD BEEN SILENCED
LawrenceLessig_2010X WHOLE FORTY FIVE MINUTE VIDEO HAD BEEN SILENCED
LawrenceLessig_2010X BECAUSE THERE WERE SNIPPETS IN THAT VIDEO A VIDEO ABOUT FAIR USE THAT INCLUDED WARNER MUSIC GROUP MUSIC NOW
LawrenceLessig_2010X THEY STILL SOLD ADS FOR THAT MUSIC IF YOU PLAYED THE SILENT VIDEO YOU COULD STILL BUY THE MUSIC BUT YOU COULDN'T HEAR
LawrenceLessig_2010X BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN SILENCED SO I DID WHAT THE CURRENT REGIME SAYS I MUST DO TO BE FREE TO
LawrenceLessig_2010X USE YOUTUBE TO TALK ABOUT FAIR USE I WENT TO THIS SITE AND I HAD TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS AND THEN IN AN EXTRAORDINARILY BART SIMPSON LIKE JUVENILE WAY YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT TO TYPE
LawrenceLessig_2010X OF THE SYSTEM OF FREEDOM WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING AND THE QUESTION I ASK YOU IS WHO 'S FIGHTING IT WELL INTERESTINGLY IN THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WHO WAS THE NUMBER ONE
LawrenceLessig_2010X ACTIVE OPPONENT OF THIS SYSTEM OF REGULATION IN ONLINE SPEECH
LawrenceLessig_2010X JOHN MCCAIN
LawrenceLessig_2010X LETTER ATTACKING YOUTUBE 'S REFUSAL TO BE MORE RESPECTFUL OF FAIR USE WITH THEIR EXTRAORDINARY NOTICE AND TAKE DOWN SYSTEM THAT LED HIS CAMPAIGN SO MANY TIMES TO BE THROWN OFF
LawrenceLessig_2010X ME THEN MY GOOD OLD OLD DAYS OF RIGHT WING LUNACY LET ME COME BACK TO NOW
LawrenceLessig_2010X NOW WHEN I'M A LITTLE LEFTIST I'M CERTAINLY LEFT HANDED SO AT LEAST A LEFTY AND I WONDER CAN WE ON THE LEFT EXPECT TO BUILD THIS ECOLOGY OF FREEDOM NOW
LawrenceLessig_2010X IN A WORLD WHERE WE KNOW THE EXTRAORDINARILY POWERFUL INFLUENCES AGAINST IT WHERE EVEN
LawrenceLessig_2010X ICONS OF THE LEFT LIKE THIS ENTERTAIN AND PUSH BILLS THAT WOULD EFFECTIVELY BAN THE REQUIREMENT OF OPEN ACCESS FOR GOVERNMENT FUNDED RESEARCH THE PRESIDENT WHO HAS SUPPORTED
LawrenceLessig_2010X A PROCESS THAT SECRETLY NEGOTIATES AGREEMENTS WHICH EFFECTIVELY LOCK US INTO THE INSANE SYSTEM OF DMCA THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED AND LIKELY LOCK US DOWN A PATH OF THREE STRIKES YOU'RE OUT
LawrenceLessig_2010X OF COURSE THE REST OF THE WORLD ARE INCREASINGLY ADOPTING NOT A SINGLE EXAMPLE OF REFORM HAS BEEN PRODUCED YET AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THIS CHANGE IN THIS SYSTEM ANYTIME SOON
LawrenceLessig_2010X SO HERE 'S THE LESSONS
LawrenceLessig_2010X OPENNESS THAT I THINK WE NEED TO LEARN
LawrenceLessig_2010X OPENNESS IS A COMMITMENT TO A CERTAIN SET OF VALUES WE NEED TO SPEAK OF THOSE VALUES
LawrenceLessig_2010X THE VALUE OF FREEDOM IT'S A VALUE OF COMMUNITY IT'S A VALUE OF THE LIMITS IN REGULATION IT'S A VALUE RESPECTING THE CREATOR
LawrenceLessig_2010X NOW IF WE CAN LEARN THOSE VALUES FROM AT LEAST SOME INFLUENCES ON THE RIGHT IF WE CAN TAKE THEM AND INCORPORATE THEM MAYBE WE COULD DO A LITTLE TRADE WE LEARN THOSE VALUES ON THE LEFT
LawrenceLessig_2010X AND MAYBE THEY'LL DO HEALTH CARE OR
