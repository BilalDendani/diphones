TomShannon_2009S HERE WITH YOU TOM AND I WANT TO START WITH A QUESTION THAT HAS JUST
TomShannon_2009S IN SOME SORT OF INTERPLAY WITH CREATIVE FORCE ARE THEY EVER IN EQUILIBRIUM IN THE WAY THAT YOU SEE YOUR WORK
TomShannon_2009S THE SUBJECT MATTER THAT I'M LOOKING FOR IT'S USUALLY TO SOLVE A QUESTION I HAD THE QUESTION POPPED INTO MY HEAD WHAT DOES CONE THAT CONNECTS THE SUN AND
TomShannon_2009S THE EARTH LOOK LIKE IF YOU COULD CONNECT THE TWO SPHERES AND IN PROPORTION WHAT WOULD THE SIZE OF THE SPHERE AND THE LENGTH
TomShannon_2009S WHAT WOULD THE TAPER BE TO THE EARTH AND SO I WENT ABOUT IT AND MADE THAT SCULPTURE TURNING IT OUT OF SOLID BRONZE AND
TomShannon_2009S I DID ONE THAT WAS ABOUT THIRTY FIVE FT LONG THE SUN END WAS ABOUT FOUR INCHES IN DIAMETER AND THEN IT TAPERED OVER
TomShannon_2009S ABOUT THIRTY FIVE FT TO ABOUT A MILLIMETER AT THE EARTH END AND SO FOR ME IT WAS REALLY EXCITING JUST TO SEE
TomShannon_2009S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IF YOU COULD STEP OUTSIDE AND INTO A LARGER CONTEXT AS THOUGH YOU WERE AN ASTRONAUT AND SEE THESE TWO THINGS AS AN OBJECT BECAUSE THEY ARE
TomShannon_2009S SO INTIMATELY BOUND ONE IS MEANINGLESS WITHOUT THE OTHER JH IS THERE A
TomShannon_2009S IN PLAYING WITH THESE FORCES
TomShannon_2009S AND I'M WONDERING HOW MUCH OF A SENSE OF DISCOVERY THERE IS IN PLAYING WITH THESE
TomShannon_2009S WELL LIKE THE MAGNETICALLY LEVITATED OBJECTS LIKE THAT SILVER ONE THERE THAT WAS THE RESULT OF HUNDREDS OF EXPERIMENTS WITH MAGNETS TRYING TO
TomShannon_2009S IT'S REALLY UNSATISFACTORY HAVING PLUG IN ART JH I
TomShannon_2009S THE MAGNETIC WORKS ARE A COMBINATION OF GRAVITY AND MAGNETISM SO IT'S A KIND OF MIXTURE OF THESE AMBIENT FORCES THAT INFLUENCE EVERYTHING
TomShannon_2009S THE SUN HAS A TREMENDOUS FIELD THAT EXTENDS WAY BEYOND THE PLANETS AND THE EARTH 'S MAGNETIC FIELD PROTECTS US FROM THE SUN SO THERE'S THIS HUGE
TomShannon_2009S INVISIBLE SHAPE STRUCTURES THAT MAGNETISM TAKES IN THE UNIVERSE BUT WITH THE PENDULUM
TomShannon_2009S IT ALLOWS ME TO MANIFEST THESE INVISIBLE FORCES THAT ARE HOLDING THE MAGNETS UP MY
TomShannon_2009S BUT THE PAINTINGS BECOME VERY COMPLEX BECAUSE I THINK THE FIELDS THAT ARE SUPPORTING THEM THEY'RE BILLOWING AND THEY'RE INTERPENETRATING AND THEY'RE INTERFERENCE PATTERNS
TomShannon_2009S AND THEY'RE NON DETERMINISTIC I MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW NECESSARILY WHERE YOU'RE HEADED WHEN YOU BEGIN EVEN THOUGH THE FORCES CAN BE CALCULATED
TomShannon_2009S NO JH NO TS THE FIRST ONE I DID WAS IN THE LATE SEVENTIES AND I JUST HAD A SIMPLE CONE WITH A SPIGOT AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
TomShannon_2009S IT INTO AN ORBIT AND IT ONLY HAD ONE COLOR AND WHEN IT GOT TO THE CENTER THE PAINT KEPT RUNNING OUT SO I HAD TO RUN IN THERE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER THE SPIGOT REMOTELY
TomShannon_2009S SO THAT TOLD ME RIGHT AWAY I NEED A REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE BUT THEN I STARTED DREAMING OF HAVING SIX COLORS I SORT OF THINK ABOUT IT AS THE DNA THESE COLORS THE RED BLUE YELLOW THE PRIMARY COLORS AND WHITE AND BLACK AND
TomShannon_2009S IF YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER IN DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS JUST LIKE PRINTING IN A SENSE LIKE HOW A MAGAZINE COLOR IS PRINTED AND PUT THEM UNDER CERTAIN FORCES WHICH IS ORBITING THEM
TomShannon_2009S THEM BACK AND FORTH OR DRAWING WITH THEM THESE AMAZING THINGS STARTED
TomShannon_2009S IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE LOADED FOR BEAR HERE
TomShannon_2009S YEAH WELL LET 'S PUT A COUPLE OF CANVASES I'LL ASK A COUPLE OF MY SONS TO SET UP THE CANVASES
TomShannon_2009S SAY THAT SO THIS IS JACK NICK AND
TomShannon_2009S SO HERE ARE THE
TomShannon_2009S I'M JUST GOING TO THROW THIS INTO AN ORBIT AND SEE IF I CAN PAINT EVERYBODY 'S SHOES IN THE FRONT
TomShannon_2009S THAT IS
TomShannon_2009S SO SOMETHING LIKE THIS I DOING THIS AS A DEMO AND IT'S MORE PLAYFUL BUT
TomShannon_2009S ALL OF THIS CAN BE USED I CAN REDEEM THIS PAINTING JUST CONTINUING ON DOING LAYERS UPON LAYERS AND
TomShannon_2009S I KEEP IT AROUND FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND I'M CONTEMPLATING IT AND I'LL DO ANOTHER SESSION WITH IT AND BRING IT
TomShannon_2009S UP TO ANOTHER LEVEL WHERE
TomShannon_2009S ALL OF THIS BECOMES THE BACKGROUND HE DEPTH OF IT
TomShannon_2009S THE VALVES AT THE BOTTOMS OF THE TUBES THERE ARE LIKE RADIO CONTROLLED AIRPLANE
TomShannon_2009S ALWAYS BE CHANGING COLORS PUT ALUMINUM PAINT OR I COULD PUT ANYTHING INTO THIS IT COULD BE
TomShannon_2009S TOMATO SAUCE
TomShannon_2009S ANYTHING COULD BE DISPENSED SAND POWDERS
TomShannon_2009S SO MANY FORCES THERE YOU'VE GOT GRAVITY YOU'VE GOT THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE YOU'VE GOT THE FLUID DYNAMICS
TomShannon_2009S WELL THIS PAINTING HERE I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE A SIMPLE ICONIC IMAGE OF TWO RIPPLES INTERFERING SO THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WAS DONE FIRST
TomShannon_2009S AND THEN THE ONE ON THE LEFT WAS DONE OVER IT AND THEN I LEFT GAPS SO YOU COULD SEE THE ONE THAT WAS DONE BEFORE AND THEN WHEN I DID THE SECOND ONE IT REALLY DISTURBED THE PIECE THESE BIG BLUE LINES CRASHING THROUGH
TomShannon_2009S AND SO IT CREATED A KIND OF TENSION AND AN OVERLAP THERE ARE LINES IN FRONT OF THE ONE ON THE RIGHT AND THERE ARE LINES BEHIND THE ONE ON THE LEFT AND SO IT TAKES IT INTO DIFFERENT PLANES
TomShannon_2009S WHAT IT'S ALSO ABOUT JUST THE
TomShannon_2009S LITTLE EVENTS THE EVENTS OF
TomShannon_2009S TWO THINGS THAT HAPPENED THERE'S AN INTERFERENCE PATTERN AND THEN A THIRD THING HAPPENS THERE ARE SHAPES THAT COME ABOUT JUST BY THE MARRIAGE OF TWO
TomShannon_2009S THAT ARE HAPPENING AND I'M VERY INTERESTED IN THAT LIKE THE OCCURRENCE OF MOIRE PATTERNS LIKE THIS GREEN ONE THIS IS A PAINTING I DID ABOUT
TomShannon_2009S ARE RADIO KIND OF IMAGERY AND THAT'S SOMETHING IN PAINTING I'VE NEVER SEEN DONE I'VE NEVER SEEN A REPRESENTATION
TomShannon_2009S IS THAT A LITERAL PART OF THE IMAGE OR IN MY EYE MAKING THAT INTERFERENCE PATTERN AM I COMPLETING THAT INTERFERENCE
TomShannon_2009S IT IS THE PAINT ACTUALLY MAKES IT REAL IT'S REALLY MANIFESTED THERE IF I THROW A VERY CONCENTRIC CIRCLE OR CONCENTRIC ELLIPSE IT JUST DUTIFULLY MAKES THESE
TomShannon_2009S SPACED LINES WHICH GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER WHICH DESCRIBES HOW GRAVITY WORKS THERE'S SOMETHING VERY APPEALING ABOUT THE EXACTITUDE OF SCIENCE
TomShannon_2009S THAT I REALLY ENJOY AND I LOVE THE SHAPES THAT I SEE IN SCIENTIFIC
TomShannon_2009S IN RECENT YEARS HAS KIND OF SHIFTED MORE TOWARD BIOLOGY SOME OF THESE PAINTINGS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM VERY CLOSE
TomShannon_2009S THINGS APPEAR THAT REALLY LOOK LIKE HORSES OR BIRDS OR
TomShannon_2009S HIGHLY RENDERED AND THEN THERE ARE ALL THESE FORMS THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE BUT THEY'RE EQUALLY WELL RESOLVED AND COMPLEX
TomShannon_2009S SO I THINK CONCEIVABLY THOSE COULD BE PREDICTIVE BECAUSE SINCE IT HAS THE ABILITY TO MAKE
TomShannon_2009S MAYBE IT'S THE KINDS OF FORMS SOMEONE WILL DISCOVER UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE OF MARS WHERE THERE ARE PROBABLY LAKES WITH FISH SWIMMING UNDER
TomShannon_2009S LET 'S HOPE SO OH MY GOD LET 'S OH PLEASE YES OH I'M SO THERE YOU KNOW IT SEEMS
TomShannon_2009S AT THIS STAGE IN YOUR LIFE
TomShannon_2009S YOU ALSO VERY PERSONALLY ARE IN THIS STATE OF CONFRONTATION WITH A SORT OF DISSONANT
TomShannon_2009S I SUPPOSE IT'S AN ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE THAT SOMEHOW GOVERNS PARKINSON 'S AND THIS CREATIVE FORCE THAT IS BOTH
TomShannon_2009S THE ARTIST WHO IS IN THE HERE AND NOW AND THIS SORT OF ARC OF YOUR WHOLE LIFE IS THAT RELEVANT TO YOUR WORK TS AS IT TURNS OUT
TomShannon_2009S THIS DEVICE KIND OF COMES IN HANDY BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE FINE MOTOR SKILLS TO DO THAT I CAN OPERATE SLIDES WHICH IS
TomShannon_2009S MORE OF A MENTAL PROCESS I'M LOOKING AT IT AND MAKING DECISIONS IT NEEDS MORE RED IT NEEDS MORE BLUE IT NEEDS A DIFFERENT SHAPE AND SO I MAKE THESE CREATIVE DECISIONS
TomShannon_2009S AND CAN EXECUTE THEM IN A MUCH MUCH SIMPLER WAY I MEAN I'VE GOT THE SYMPTOMS I GUESS
TomShannon_2009S MY LEFT HAND HAS A SIGNIFICANT TREMOR AND MY LEFT LEG ALSO I'M LEFT HANDED AND SO I
TomShannon_2009S ALL MY CREATIONS REALLY START ON SMALL DRAWINGS WHICH I HAVE THOUSANDS OF AND IT'S MY WAY OF JUST THINKING I DRAW WITH
TomShannon_2009S SIMPLE PENCIL AND AT FIRST THE PARKINSON 'S WAS REALLY UPSETTING BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET THE PENCIL TO STAND STILL
TomShannon_2009S SO YOU'RE NOT A GATEKEEPER FOR THESE FORCES YOU DON'T THINK OF YOURSELF AS THE MASTER OF THESE FORCES YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS THE SERVANT
TomShannon_2009S NATURE IS WELL IT'S A GODSEND IT JUST HAS SO MUCH IN IT AND I THINK NATURE WANTS TO EXPRESS ITSELF IN THE SENSE THAT
TomShannon_2009S WE ARE NATURE HUMANS ARE OF THE UNIVERSE THE UNIVERSE IS IN OUR MIND AND OUR MINDS ARE IN THE UNIVERSE AND
TomShannon_2009S WE ARE EXPRESSIONS OF THE UNIVERSE BASICALLY AS HUMANS ULTIMATELY BEING PART OF THE UNIVERSE
TomShannon_2009S WE'RE KIND OF THE SPOKESPEOPLE OR THE OBSERVER PART OF THE CONSTITUENCY OF THE UNIVERSE AND TO INTERFACE WITH IT
TomShannon_2009S WITH A DEVICE THAT LETS THESE FORCES THAT ARE EVERYWHERE ACT AND SHOW WHAT IT CAN DO GIVING THEM PIGMENT AND PAINT JUST LIKE AN ARTIST
TomShannon_2009S WELL I LOVE THE IDEA THAT SOMEWHERE WITHIN THIS IDEA OF FINE MOTION AND CONTROL
TomShannon_2009S WITH THE TRADITIONAL SKILLS THAT YOU HAVE WITH YOUR HAND SOME SORT OF MORE ELEMENTAL FORCE GETS REVEALED AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY HERE TOM THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S BEEN REALLY REALLY GREAT
