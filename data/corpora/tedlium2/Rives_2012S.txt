Rives_2012S@15.77:33.23 LAST MONTH THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS GOING OUT OF PRINT AFTER TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR YEARS WHICH MADE ME NOSTALGIC BECAUSE I REMEMBER PLAYING A GAME WITH THE COLOSSAL ENCYCLOPEDIA SET IN MY HOMETOWN LIBRARY BACK WHEN I WAS A KID MAYBE TWELVE YEARS OLD
Rives_2012S@33.23:35.97 AND I WONDERED IF I COULD UPDATE THAT GAME
Rives_2012S@35.97:39.42 NOT JUST FOR MODERN METHODS BUT FOR THE MODERN ME
Rives_2012S@39.42:47.51 SO I TRIED I WENT TO AN ONLINE ENCYCLOPEDIA WIKIPEDIA AND I ENTERED THE TERM EARTH YOU CAN START ANYWHERE THIS TIME I CHOSE EARTH
Rives_2012S@47.58:58.49 AND THE FIRST RULE OF THE GAME IS PRETTY SIMPLE YOU JUST HAVE TO READ THE ARTICLE UNTIL YOU FIND SOMETHING YOU DON 'T KNOW AND PREFERABLY SOMETHING YOUR DAD DOESN 'T EVEN KNOW AND IN THIS CASE
Rives_2012S@58.5:64.59 I QUICKLY FOUND THIS THE FURTHEST POINT FROM THE CENTER OF THE EARTH IS NOT THE TIP OF MOUNT EVEREST LIKE I MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT
Rives_2012S@64.7:68.17 IT 'S THE TIP OF THIS MOUNTAIN MOUNT CHIMBORAZO IN ECUADOR
Rives_2012S@68.43:74.61 THE EARTH SPINS OF COURSE AS IT TRAVELS AROUND THE SUN SO THE EARTH BULGES A LITTLE BIT AROUND THE MIDDLE LIKE SOME EARTHLINGS
Rives_2012S@126.35:131.58 THAT TOOK ME TO THIS WET AND WARM BAND OF THE TROPICS THAT ENCIRCLES THE EARTH
Rives_2012S@138.48:148.5 THOSE ARE NOT CARTOGRAPHERS LINES LIKE LATITUDE OR THE BORDERS BETWEEN NATIONS THEY ARE ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENA CAUSED BY THE EARTH 'S TILT AND THEY CHANGE
Rives_2012S@148.5:161.39 THEY MOVE THEY GO UP THEY GO DOWN IN FACT FOR YEARS THE TROPIC OF CANCER AND THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN HAVE BEEN STEADILY DRIFTING TOWARDS THE EQUATOR AT THE RATE OF ABOUT FIFTEEN METERS PER YEAR AND NOBODY TOLD ME THAT I DIDN 'T KNOW IT
Rives_2012S@161.41:163.5 CHIMBORAZO SO
Rives_2012S@164.68:180.33 TO KEEP THE GAME GOING I JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK THAT ONE UP SINCE I 'M ALREADY IN THE TROPICS I CHOSE TROPICAL RAINFOREST FAMOUS FOR ITS DIVERSITY HUMAN DIVERSITY THERE ARE STILL DOZENS AND DOZENS OF UNCONTACTED TRIBES LIVING ON THIS PLANET
Rives_2012S@207.76:209.33 WHICH TURN OUT TO BE
Rives_2012S@209.38:219.68 BEETLES NOW I CLICKED ON THIS ON PURPOSE BUT IF I 'D SOMEHOW GOTTEN HERE BY MISTAKE IT DOES REMIND ME FOR THE BAND SEE THE BEATLES FOR THE CAR SEE VOLKSWAGON BEETLE BUT I AM HERE
Rives_2012S@240.9:257.07 YOU ARE ASTONISHINGLY WELL ADAPTED THERE ARE SCAVENGER BEETLES THAT PICK THE SKIN AND FLESH OFF OF BONES IN MUSEUMS THERE ARE PREDATOR BEETLES THAT ATTACK OTHER INSECTS AND STILL LOOK PRETTY CUTE TO US THERE ARE BEETLES THAT ROLL LITTLE BALLS OF DUNG
Rives_2012S@257.07:270.66 GREAT DISTANCES ACROSS THE DESERT FLOOR TO FEED TO THEIR HATCHLINGS THIS REMINDED THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS OF THEIR GOD KHEPRI WHO RENEWS THE BALL OF THE SUN EVERY MORNING WHICH IS HOW THAT DUNG ROLLING SCARAB BECAME
Rives_2012S@276.92:291.25 HAVE THE MOST ROMANTIC FLIRTATION IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM FIREFLIES ARE NOT FLIES FIREFLIES ARE BEETLES FIREFLIES ARE COLEOPTERA AND COLEOPTERA COMMUNICATE IN OTHER WAYS AS WELL LIKE MY NEXT LINK THE CHEMICAL LANGUAGE
Rives_2012S@294.7:298.78 TOOK ME TO A VIDEO OF A SEA URCHIN HAVING SEX
Rives_2012S@305.78:310.57 AND THE LINK TO APHRODISIAC NOW THAT 'S SOMETHING THAT INCREASES SEXUAL DESIRE POSSIBLY
Rives_2012S@310.77:327.43 CHOCOLATE THERE IS A COMPOUND IN CHOCOLATE CALLED PHENETHYLAMINE THAT MIGHT BE AN APHRODISIAC BUT AS THE ARTICLE MENTIONS BECAUSE OF ENZYME BREAKDOWN IT 'S UNLIKELY THAT PHENETHYLAMINE WILL REACH YOUR BRAIN IF TAKEN ORALLY SO THOSE OF YOU WHO ONLY EAT YOUR CHOCOLATE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO EXPERIMENT
Rives_2012S@336.72:338.32 BUT NOT WHEN THEY 'RE TOGETHER LIKE THAT
Rives_2012S@338.89:343.77 I DO LIKE SYMPATHY I DO LIKE MAGIC SO WHEN I CLICK ON SYMPATHETIC MAGIC I GET
Rives_2012S@344.49:346.24 SYMPATHETIC MAGIC
Rives_2012S@350.66:354.86 SYMPATHETIC MAGIC IS IMITATION IF YOU IMITATE SOMETHING MAYBE YOU CAN HAVE AN EFFECT ON IT
Rives_2012S@366.63:375.75 WE 'VE GOT TENS OF THOUSANDS YEARS OLD ARTWORK COMMON THEMES AROUND THE GLOBE INCLUDE LARGE WILD ANIMALS AND TRACINGS OF HUMAN HANDS USUALLY
Rives_2012S@381.76:399.21 SO EVEN THOUGH I DON 'T KNOW WHY A PALEOLITHIC PERSON WOULD TRACE HIS HAND OR BLOW PIGMENT ON IT FROM A TUBE I CAN EASILY PICTURE HOW HE DID IT AND I REALLY DON 'T THINK IT 'S THAT DIFFERENT FORM OUR OWN LITTLE DOMINANT HAND AVATAR RIGHT THERE THAT I 'M GOING TO USE NOW TO CLICK ON THE TERM FOR HAND
Rives_2012S@399.77:417.69 GO TO THE PAGE FOR HAND WHERE I FOUND THE MOST FUN AND POSSIBLY EMBARRASSING BIT OF TRIVIA I 'VE FOUND IN A LONG TIME IT 'S SIMPLY THIS THE BACK OF THE HAND IS FORMALLY CALLED THE OPISTHENAR NOW THAT 'S EMBARRASSING BECAUSE UP UNTIL NOW EVERY TIME I 'VE SAID I KNOW IT LIKE THE BACK

Rives_2012S@441.04:443.24 HE DOESN 'T HE LIVES IN RAINFORESTS AND SAVANNAS
Rives_2012S@443.24:450.77 IT 'S JUST THAT WE 'RE ALWAYS THINKING OF THIS GUY AS LAGGING BEHIND US EVOLUTIONARILY OR SOMEHOW UNCANNILY CREEPING UP ON US AND IN SOME CASES
Rives_2012S@450.85:453.02 HE GETS PLACES BEFORE US

Rives_2012S@487.69:504.58 WHEN I CLICK ON YURI GAGARIN 'S PAGE I GET THIS GUY WHO WAS SURPRISINGLY SHORT IN STATURE HUGE IN HEROISM TOP ESTIMATES SOVIET ESTIMATES PUT THIS GUY AT ONE POINT SIX FIVE METERS THAT IS LESS THAN FIVE AND A HALF FEET TALL MAX POSSIBLY BECAUSE HE WAS MALNOURISHED AS A CHILD
Rives_2012S@504.67:513 GERMANS OCCUPIED RUSSIA A NAZI OFFICER TOOK OVER THE GAGARIN HOUSEHOLD AND HE AND HIS FAMILY BUILT AND LIVED IN A MUD HUT
Rives_2012S@513.22:516.44 YEARS LATER THE BOY FROM THAT CRAMPED MUD HUT
Rives_2012S@516.51:527.42 WOULD GROW UP TO BE THE MAN IN THAT CRAMPED CAPSULE ON THE TIP OF A ROCKET WHO VOLUNTEERED TO BE LAUNCHED INTO OUTER SPACE THE FIRST ONE OF ANY OF US TO

Rives_2012S@558.27:562.34 YOU CAN CLICK ON ONE MORE LINK YOU CAN COME BACK TO EARTH
Rives_2012S@562.8:564.48 RETURN TO WHERE YOU STARTED
Rives_2012S@566.72:570.26 YOU CAN FINISH YOUR GAME YOU JUST NEED TO FIND ONE MORE FACT THAT YOU DIDN 'T KNOW
Rives_2012S@570.53:572.79 AND FOR ME I QUICKLY LANDED ON THIS ONE
Rives_2012S@573.39:585.5 THE EARTH HAS A TOLERANCE OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN PERCENT FROM THE REFERENCE SPHEROID WHICH IS LESS THAN THE TWENTY TWO PERCENT ALLOWED IN BILLIARD BALLS THIS IS THE KIND OF FACT I WOULD HAVE LOVED AS A BOY I FOUND IT MYSELF
Rives_2012S@585.53:595.19 IT 'S GOT SOME MATH THAT I CAN DO I 'M PRETTY SURE MY DAD DOESN 'T KNOW IT WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IF YOU COULD SHRINK THE EARTH TO THE SIZE OF A BILLIARD BALL
Rives_2012S@608.18:612.73 SEA CREATURES MAKING LOVE IN THE DEEP BLUE SEA YOU JUST SHRINK
Rives_2012S@615.02:616.99 IT WOULD BE AS SMOOTH
Rives_2012S@621.05:623.08 WITH A SLIGHT BULGE AROUND THE MIDDLE
