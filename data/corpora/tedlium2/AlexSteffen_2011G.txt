AlexSteffen_2011G@24.54:33.77 THAT THOSE OF US WHO LIVE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD NEED TO BE REALLY PUSHING TOWARDS ELIMINATING OUR EMISSIONS THAT 'S TO PUT IT MILDLY NOT WHAT 'S ON THE TABLE NOW
AlexSteffen_2011G@33.77:41.62 AND IT TENDS TO FEEL A LITTLE OVERWHELMING WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT IS THERE IN REALITY TODAY AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE FACE
AlexSteffen_2011G@41.62:55.88 AND WHEN WE HAVE OVERWHELMING PROBLEMS IN FRONT OF US WE TEND TO SEEK SIMPLE ANSWERS AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE 'VE DONE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE WE LOOK AT WHERE THE EMISSIONS ARE COMING FROM THEY 'RE COMING OUT OF OUR TAILPIPES AND SMOKESTACKS AND SO FORTH
AlexSteffen_2011G@55.88:65.35 AND WE SAY OKAY WELL THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY 'RE COMING OUT OF FOSSIL FUELS THAT WE 'RE BURNING SO THEREFORE THE ANSWER MUST BE TO REPLACE THOSE FOSSIL FUELS WITH CLEAN SOURCES OF ENERGY
AlexSteffen_2011G@65.35:71.63 AND WHILE OF COURSE WE DO NEED CLEAN ENERGY I WOULD PUT TO YOU THAT IT 'S POSSIBLE THAT BY LOOKING AT
AlexSteffen_2011G@71.74:78 CLIMATE CHANGE AS A CLEAN ENERGY GENERATION PROBLEM WE 'RE IN FACT SETTING OURSELVES UP NOT TO SOLVE IT
AlexSteffen_2011G@78:84.64 AND THE REASON WHY IS THAT WE LIVE ON A PLANET THAT IS RAPIDLY URBANIZING
AlexSteffen_2011G@102.65:122.61 IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF ENERGY THAT IT WOULD TAKE FOR EIGHT BILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN CITIES THAT ARE EVEN SOMEWHAT LIKE THE CITIES THAT THOSE OF US IN THE GLOBAL NORTH LIVE IN TODAY WE WOULD HAVE TO GENERATE AN ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING AMOUNT OF ENERGY IT MAY BE POSSIBLE THAT WE ARE NOT EVEN ABLE TO BUILD THAT MUCH CLEAN ENERGY
AlexSteffen_2011G@122.61:131.09 SO IF WE 'RE SERIOUSLY TALKING ABOUT TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE ON AN URBANIZING PLANET WE NEED TO LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR THE SOLUTION
AlexSteffen_2011G@131.09:144.67 THE SOLUTION IN FACT MAY BE CLOSER TO HAND THAN WE THINK BECAUSE ALL OF THOSE CITIES WE 'RE BUILDING ARE OPPORTUNITIES EVERY CITY DETERMINES TO A VERY LARGE EXTENT THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY USED BY ITS INHABITANTS
AlexSteffen_2011G@157.01:175.15 I WON 'T SHOW YOU VERY MANY GRAPHS TODAY BUT IF I CAN JUST FOCUS ON THIS ONE FOR A MOMENT IT REALLY TELLS US A LOT OF WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW WHICH IS QUITE SIMPLY THAT IF YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT TRANSPORTATION A MAJOR CATEGORY OF CLIMATE EMISSIONS THERE IS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HOW DENSE A CITY IS
AlexSteffen_2011G@175.15:184.79 AND THE AMOUNT OF CLIMATE EMISSIONS THAT ITS RESIDENTS SPEW OUT INTO THE AIR AND THE CORRELATION OF COURSE IS THAT DENSER PLACES TEND TO HAVE LOWER EMISSIONS
AlexSteffen_2011G@184.79:201.99 WHICH ISN 'T REALLY ALL THAT DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT BASICALLY WE SUBSTITUTE IN OUR LIVES ACCESS TO THE THINGS WE WANT WE GO OUT THERE AND WE HOP IN OUR CARS AND WE DRIVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND WE 'RE BASICALLY USING MOBILITY TO GET THE ACCESS WE NEED
AlexSteffen_2011G@201.99:215.05 BUT WHEN WE LIVE IN A DENSER COMMUNITY SUDDENLY WHAT WE FIND OF COURSE IS THAT THE THINGS WE NEED ARE CLOSE BY AND SINCE THE MOST SUSTAINABLE TRIP IS THE ONE THAT YOU NEVER HAD TO MAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE SUDDENLY OUR LIVES BECOME INSTANTLY MORE SUSTAINABLE
AlexSteffen_2011G@215.05:234.28 AND IT IS POSSIBLE OF COURSE TO INCREASE THE DENSITY OF THE COMMUNITIES AROUND US SOME PLACES ARE DOING THIS WITH NEW ECO DISTRICTS DEVELOPING WHOLE NEW SUSTAINABLE NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH IS NICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT BUT MOST OF THE TIME WHAT WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IN FACT REWEAVING THE URBAN FABRIC THAT WE ALREADY HAVE SO WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE INFILL DEVELOPMENT
AlexSteffen_2011G@234.28:244.91 REALLY SHARP LITTLE CHANGES TO WHERE WE HAVE BUILDINGS WHERE WE 'RE DEVELOPING URBAN RETROFITTING CREATING DIFFERENT SORTS OF SPACES AND USES OUT OF PLACES THAT ARE ALREADY THERE
AlexSteffen_2011G@244.91:261.69 INCREASINGLY WE 'RE REALIZING THAT WE DON 'T EVEN NEED TO DENSIFY AN ENTIRE CITY WHAT WE NEED INSTEAD IS AN AVERAGE DENSITY THAT RISES TO A LEVEL WHERE WE DON 'T DRIVE AS MUCH AND SO ON AND THAT CAN BE DONE BY RAISING THE DENSITY IN VERY SPECIFIC SPOTS A WHOLE LOT
AlexSteffen_2011G@267.85:282.94 AND WE FIND THAT WHEN WE DO THAT WE CAN IN FACT HAVE A FEW PLACES THAT ARE REALLY HYPER DENSE WITHIN A WIDER FABRIC OF PLACES THAT ARE PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE AND ACHIEVE THE SAME RESULTS NOW WE MAY FIND THAT THERE ARE PLACES THAT ARE REALLY REALLY DENSE AND STILL HOLD ONTO THEIR CARS
AlexSteffen_2011G@282.94:298.76 BUT THE REALITY IS THAT BY AND LARGE WHAT WE SEE WHEN WE GET A LOT OF PEOPLE TOGETHER WITH THE RIGHT CONDITIONS IS A THRESHOLD EFFECT WHERE PEOPLE SIMPLY STOP DRIVING AS MUCH AND INCREASINGLY MORE AND MORE PEOPLE IF THEY 'RE SURROUNDED BY PLACES THAT MAKE THEM FEEL AT HOME GIVE UP THEIR CARS ALTOGETHER
AlexSteffen_2011G@298.76:304.54 AND THIS IS A HUGE HUGE ENERGY SAVINGS BECAUSE WHAT COMES OUT OF OUR TAILPIPE IS REALLY JUST
AlexSteffen_2011G@320.25:330.13 AND PEOPLE ARE EMBRACING THIS ALL AROUND THE WORLD WE 'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE EMBRACE THIS WALKSHED LIFE PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT IT 'S MOVING FROM THE IDEA OF THE DREAM HOME TO THE DREAM NEIGHBORHOOD
AlexSteffen_2011G@330.13:349.2 AND WHEN YOU LAYER THAT OVER WITH THE KIND OF UBIQUITOUS COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE 'RE STARTING TO SEE WHAT YOU FIND IS IN FACT EVEN MORE ACCESS SUFFUSED INTO SPACES SOME OF IT 'S TRANSPORTATION ACCESS THIS IS A MAPNIFICENT MAP THAT SHOWS ME IN THIS CASE HOW FAR I CAN GET FROM MY HOME IN THIRTY MINUTES USING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
AlexSteffen_2011G@349.2:361.93 SOME OF IT IS ABOUT WALKING IT 'S NOT ALL PERFECT YET THIS IS GOOGLE WALKING MAPS I ASKED HOW TO DO THE GREATER RIDGEWAY AND IT TOLD ME TO GO VIA GUERNSEY IT DID TELL ME THAT THIS ROUTE MAYBE MISSING SIDEWALKS OR PEDESTRIAN PATHS
AlexSteffen_2011G@379.94:390.54 PART OF WHAT WE 'RE FINDING WITH THIS IS THAT WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS THE MAJOR POINT OF MANUFACTURING AND CONSUMPTION WHICH IS TO GET A BUNCH OF STUFF
AlexSteffen_2011G@390.54:402.19 IS NOT IN FACT HOW WE REALLY LIVE BEST IN DENSE ENVIRONMENTS WHAT WE 'RE FINDING IS THAT WHAT WE WANT IS ACCESS TO THE CAPACITIES OF THINGS MY FAVORITE EXAMPLE IS A DRILL WHO HERE OWNS A DRILL A HOME POWER DRILL
AlexSteffen_2011G@402.19:407.9 OKAY I DO TOO THE AVERAGE HOME POWER DRILL IS USED SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIX AND TWENTY MINUTES IN ITS ENTIRE LIFETIME
AlexSteffen_2011G@407.9:418.68 DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ASK AND SO WHAT WE DO IS WE BUY THESE DRILLS THAT HAVE A POTENTIAL CAPACITY OF THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF DRILL TIME USE THEM ONCE OR TWICE TO PUT A HOLE IN THE WALL AND LET THEM SIT
AlexSteffen_2011G@418.68:437.88 OUR CITIES I WOULD PUT TO YOU ARE STOCKPILES OF THESE SURPLUS CAPACITIES AND WHILE WE COULD TRY AND FIGURE OUT NEW WAYS TO USE THOSE CAPACITIES SUCH AS COOKING OR MAKING ICE SCULPTURES OR EVEN A MAFIA HIT WHAT WE PROBABLY WILL FIND IS THAT IN FACT TURNING THOSE PRODUCTS INTO SERVICES THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO WHEN WE WANT THEM
AlexSteffen_2011G@437.88:440.39 IS A FAR SMARTER WAY TO GO
AlexSteffen_2011G@440.39:447.87 AND IN FACT EVEN SPACE ITSELF IS TURNING INTO A SERVICE WE 'RE FINDING THAT PEOPLE CAN SHARE THE SAME SPACES DO STUFF WITH VACANT SPACE
AlexSteffen_2011G@447.87:455.83 BUILDINGS ARE BECOMING BUNDLES OF SERVICES SO WE HAVE NEW DESIGNS THAT ARE HELPING US TAKE MECHANICAL THINGS THAT WE USED TO SPEND ENERGY ON
AlexSteffen_2011G@455.83:475.45 LIKE HEATING COOLING ETC AND TURN THEM INTO THINGS THAT WE AVOID SPENDING ENERGY ON SO WE LIGHT OUR BUILDINGS WITH DAYLIGHT WE COOL THEM WITH BREEZES WE HEAT THEM WITH SUNSHINE IN FACT WHEN WE USE ALL THESE THINGS WHAT WE 'VE FOUND IS THAT IN SOME CASES ENERGY USE IN A BUILDING CAN DROP AS MUCH AS NINETY PERCENT WHICH BRINGS ON ANOTHER THRESHOLD EFFECT I LIKE TO CALL FURNACE DUMPING
AlexSteffen_2011G@475.45:484.76 WHICH IS QUITE SIMPLY IF YOU HAVE A BUILDING THAT DOESN 'T NEED TO BE HEATED WITH A FURNACE YOU SAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF MONEY UP FRONT THESE THINGS ACTUALLY BECOME CHEAPER TO BUILD THAN THE ALTERNATIVES
AlexSteffen_2011G@484.76:491.3 NOW WHEN WE LOOK AT BEING ABLE TO SLASH OUR PRODUCT USE SLASH OUR TRANSPORTATION USE
AlexSteffen_2011G@505.16:513.31 AND CERTAINLY LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN TO HEART THIS IDEA THAT A SUSTAINABLE CITY IS COVERED IN GREENERY SO WE HAVE VISIONS LIKE THIS WE HAVE VISIONS LIKE THIS
AlexSteffen_2011G@513.31:527.99 WE HAVE VISIONS LIKE THIS NOW ALL OF THESE ARE FINE PROJECTS BUT THEY REALLY HAVE MISSED AN ESSENTIAL POINT WHICH IS IT 'S NOT ABOUT THE LEAVES ABOVE IT 'S ABOUT THE SYSTEMS BELOW DO THEY FOR INSTANCE CAPTURE RAINWATER SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE WATER USE
AlexSteffen_2011G@527.99:530.19 WATER IS ENERGY INTENSIVE
AlexSteffen_2011G@530.19:540.62 DO THEY PERHAPS INCLUDE GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE CAN TAKE RUNOFF AND WATER THAT 'S GOING OUT OF OUR HOUSES AND CLEAN IT AND FILTER IT AND GROW URBAN STREET TREES
AlexSteffen_2011G@540.62:547.12 DO THEY CONNECT US BACK TO THE ECOSYSTEMS AROUND US BY FOR EXAMPLE CONNECTING US TO RIVERS AND ALLOWING FOR RESTORATION
AlexSteffen_2011G@547.12:562.07 DO THEY ALLOW FOR POLLINATION POLLINATOR PATHWAYS THAT BEES AND BUTTERFLIES AND SUCH CAN COME BACK INTO OUR CITIES DO THEY EVEN TAKE THE VERY WASTE MATTER THAT WE HAVE FROM FOOD AND FIBER AND SO FORTH AND TURN IT BACK INTO SOIL
AlexSteffen_2011G@572.14:583.5 AND THAT IT 'S A DARN GOOD THING BECAUSE RIGHT NOW OUR ECONOMY BY AND LARGE OPERATES AS PAUL HAWKEN SAID BY STEALING THE FUTURE SELLING IT IN THE PRESENT AND CALLING IT GDP
AlexSteffen_2011G@583.5:594.93 AND IF WE HAVE ANOTHER EIGHT BILLION OR SEVEN BILLION OR SIX BILLION EVEN PEOPLE LIVING ON A PLANET WHERE THEIR CITIES ALSO STEAL THE FUTURE WE 'RE GOING TO RUN OUT OF FUTURE REALLY FAST
