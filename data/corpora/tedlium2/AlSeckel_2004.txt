AlSeckel_2004@12.79:20.98 TALK MY A NEW LECTURE JUST FOR TED AND I'M GOING SHOW YOU SOME ILLUSIONS THAT WE'VE CREATED FOR TED AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO RELATE THIS TO HAPPINESS
AlSeckel_2004@21.36:33.77 I WAS THINKING ABOUT WITH HAPPINESS IS WHAT GIVES HAPPINESS OR HAPPINESS WHICH I EQUATE WITH JOY IN MY PARTICULAR AREA AND I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING VERY FUNDAMENTAL AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS
AlSeckel_2004@34.35:42.23 AND IT'S IN TERMS OF BOTH ILLUSIONS AND MOVIES THAT WE GO SEE AND JOKES AND MAGIC SHOWS IS THAT
AlSeckel_2004@67.18:71.67 SO WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY AND DO IN MY LECTURE IS A GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER AND SEE
AlSeckel_2004@72.23:84.81 CAN VIOLATE YOUR EXPECTATIONS IN A PLEASING WAY I MEAN SOMETIMES EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE VIOLATED ARE NOT PLEASANT BUT I'M GOING TO TRY TO DO IT IN A PLEASANT WAY IN A VERY PRIMAL WAY SO I CAN MAKE THE AUDIENCE HERE HAPPY
AlSeckel_2004@85.27:93.61 SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME WAYS THAT WE CAN VIOLATE YOUR EXPECTATIONS FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE PARTICULAR ILLUSION HERE
AlSeckel_2004@93.76:99.63 I WANT YOU FIRST OF ALL WHEN IT POPS UP ON THE SCREEN TO NOTICE THAT THE TWO HOLES ARE PERPENDICULAR TO EACH OTHER
AlSeckel_2004@102.64:103.68 THESE ARE REAL OBJECTS
AlSeckel_2004@113.61:121.14 NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW IT IS DONE I'VE LOOPED THE FILM HERE SO YOU CAN GET A VERY INTERESTING EXPERIENCE I WANT YOU TO SEE
AlSeckel_2004@121.50:131.26 HOW THIS ILLUSION IS CONSTRUCTED AND IT'S GOING TO ROTATE SO YOU SEE THAT IT'S INSIDE OUT NOW WATCH AS IT ROTATES BACK HOW QUICKLY YOUR PERCEPTION SNAPS
AlSeckel_2004@132.26:143.65 OK NOW WATCH IT AS IT ROTATES BACK AGAIN AND THIS IS A VERY BRIGHT AUDIENCE ALL RIGHT SEE IF YOU CAN STOP IT FROM HAPPENING EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW ONE HUNDRED PERCENT IT'S TRUE THAT
AlSeckel_2004@144.40:144.62 YOU
AlSeckel_2004@151.10:153.52 WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN NO DOUBT ABOUT
AlSeckel_2004@154.16:156.00 SEE IF YOU CAN STOP IT FROM HAPPENING
AlSeckel_2004@158.24:159.03 IT'S DIFFICULT
AlSeckel_2004@161.95:163.49 AND WE CAN VIOLATE YOUR
AlSeckel_2004@164.37:172.14 IN A WHOLE VARIETY OF WAYS ABOUT REPRESENTATION ABOUT SHAPE ABOUT COLOR AND SO FORTH AND IT'S VERY PRIMAL AND IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION TO
AlSeckel_2004@172.37:174.29 PONDER WHY THESE THINGS
AlSeckel_2004@176.30:183.88 WE FIND THESE THINGS JOYFUL WHY WOULD WE FIND THEM JOYFUL SO HERE 'S SOMETHING THAT LIONEL DID A WHILE AGO I LIKE THESE SORT OF LITTLE THINGS LIKE THIS
AlSeckel_2004@222.48:225.35 OK WE CAN VIOLATE YOUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT SHAPE
AlSeckel_2004@244.09:248.88 WE CAN VIOLATE YOUR EXPECTATIONS ON REPRESENTATION WHAT AN IMAGE REPRESENTS
AlSeckel_2004@249.93:251.15 WHAT DO YOU SEE HERE
AlSeckel_2004@260.70:270.91 SEE DOLPHINS OK THOSE PEOPLE WHO RAISED THEIR HANDS AFTERWARDS THE REST OF THE AUDIENCE GO TALK TO THEM ALL RIGHT ACTUALLY THIS IS THE BEST EXAMPLE
AlSeckel_2004@270.99:278.87 OF PRIMING BY EXPERIENCE THAT I KNOW IF YOU ARE A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF TEN WHO HAVEN'T BEEN RUINED YET
AlSeckel_2004@280.85:285.33 LOOK AT THIS IMAGE AND SEE DOLPHINS NOW SOME OF YOU ADULTS HERE ARE SAYING
AlSeckel_2004@285.70:288.52 DOLPHINS WHAT DOLPHINS BUT IN FACT IF YOU
AlSeckel_2004@289.04:297.89 FIGURE GROUND IN OTHER WORDS THE DARK AREAS HERE I FORGOT TO ASK FOR A POINTER BUT IF YOU REVERSE IT YOU'LL SEE A WHOLE SERIES OF LITTLE DOLPHINS BY THE WAY
AlSeckel_2004@304.24:304.55 IT'S
AlSeckel_2004@308.58:310.17 SOMETHING LIKE THIS CAN BE
AlSeckel_2004@310.44:312.63 BECAUSE THIS IS AFTER ALL TALK ABOUT DESIGN
AlSeckel_2004@313.12:321.05 THIS IS DONE BY SAATCHI AND SAATCHI AND THEY ACTUALLY GOT AWAY WITH THIS AD IN AUSTRALIA SO IF YOU LOOK AT THIS AD FOR BEER
AlSeckel_2004@321.35:328.57 ALL THOSE PEOPLE ARE IN SORT OF PROVOCATIVE POSITIONS BUT THEY GOT IT PAST AND ACTUALLY WON THE CLIO AWARDS
AlSeckel_2004@328.96:331.70 SO IT IS FUNNY TO DO THESE THINGS
AlSeckel_2004@337.29:338.76 THIS IS THE JOKE I DID
AlSeckel_2004@340.27:347.49 WHEN THE THE FLORIDA BALLOT WAS GOING AROUND YOU KNOW COUNT THE DOTS FOR GORE COUNT THE DOTS FOR BUSH COUNT THEM AGAIN
AlSeckel_2004@351.10:355.38 YOU CAN VIOLATE YOUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT EXPERIENCE HERE IS
AlSeckel_2004@371.32:372.55 THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE BUILDING
AlSeckel_2004@372.67:374.81 FOR YOU KNOW AMUSEMENT PARKS AND THAT KIND OF STUFF
AlSeckel_2004@375.42:377.33 NOW LET 'S TAKE A STATIC IMAGE
AlSeckel_2004@378.14:384.60 CAN YOU SEE THIS DO YOU SEE THE MIDDLE SECTION MOVING DOWN AND THE OUTER SECTIONS MOVING UP IT'S COMPLETELY STATIC
AlSeckel_2004@385.93:387.96 A STATIC IMAGE HOW MANY PEOPLE SEE
AlSeckel_2004@391.32:392.51 IT'S COMPLETELY STATIC
AlSeckel_2004@394.30:401.50 RIGHT NOW WHEN IT'S INTERESTING THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT AN IMAGE WE SEE YOU KNOW COLOR DEPTH TEXTURE
AlSeckel_2004@402.68:410.55 AND YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS WHOLE SCENE AND ANALYZE IT YOU CAN SEE THE WOMAN IS IN CLOSER THAN THE WALL AND SO FORTH BUT THE WHOLE THING IS ACTUALLY FLAT
AlSeckel_2004@413.65:419.92 AND IT WAS SUCH A GOOD TROMPE L 'OEIL THAT PEOPLE GOT IRRITATED WHEN THEY TRIED TO TALK TO THE WOMAN AND SHE WOULDN'T RESPOND
AlSeckel_2004@422.89:426.04 NOW YOU CAN MAKE DESIGN MISTAKES
AlSeckel_2004@426.70:429.40 LIKE THIS BUILDING IN NEW YORK SO THAT WHEN YOU
AlSeckel_2004@432.11:439.37 SEE IT FROM THIS SIDE IT LOOKS LIKE THE BALCONIES TILT UP AND WHEN YOU WALK AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE IT LOOKS LIKE THE BALCONIES
AlSeckel_2004@440.73:446.85 GO DOWN SO THERE ARE CASES WHERE YOU HAVE MISTAKES IN DESIGN THAT INCORPORATE ILLUSIONS OR YOU TAKE
AlSeckel_2004@447.02:448.57 THIS PARTICULAR UN RETOUCHED
AlSeckel_2004@454.11:463.27 NOW INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH I GET A LOT OF EMAILS FROM PEOPLE WHO SAY IS THERE ANY PERCEPTUAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES
AlSeckel_2004@463.93:468.81 AND I REALLY SAY NO I MEAN WOMEN CAN NAVIGATE THROUGH THE WORLD JUST AS WELL AS MALES CAN AND WHY
AlSeckel_2004@470.08:479.52 HOWEVER THIS IS ONE ILLUSION THAT WOMEN CAN CONSISTENTLY DO BETTER THAN MALES IN MATCHING WHICH HEAD BECAUSE THEY RELY ON FASHION CUES THEY CAN MATCH THE
AlSeckel_2004@483.16:488.92 NOW GETTING TO A PART I WANT TO SHOW DESIGN IN ILLUSIONS I BELIEVE THAT THE FIRST EXAMPLE
AlSeckel_2004@489.29:495.79 OF ILLUSIONS BEING USED PURPOSELY WAS BY DA VINCI IN THIS ANAMORPHIC IMAGE OF
AlSeckel_2004@498.30:500.54 SO THAT WHEN YOU SAW FROM ONE LITTLE ANGLE
AlSeckel_2004@501.08:510.41 WAS LIKE THIS AND THIS LITTLE TECHNIQUE GOT POPULAR IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY AND THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY TO DISGUISE HIDDEN MEANINGS WHERE YOU COULD FLIP THE IMAGE
AlSeckel_2004@514.58:524.61 LIKE THIS BUT THESE ARE EARLY INCORPORATIONS OF ILLUSIONS BROUGHT TO SORT OF HOT POINT WITH HANS HOLBEIN 'S AMBASSADORS AND HANS HOLBEIN WORKED FOR HENRY
AlSeckel_2004@525.97:530.73 THIS WAS HUNG ON A WALL WHERE YOU COULD WALK DOWN FROM THE STAIR AND YOU CAN SEE THIS HIDDEN SKULL
AlSeckel_2004@533.76:537.89 RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME DESIGNERS WHO
AlSeckel_2004@538.10:546.92 WITH ILLUSIONS TO GIVE THAT ELEMENT OF SURPRISE ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS SCOTT KIM I WORKED WITH SCOTT TO CREATE SOME ILLUSIONS FOR TED
AlSeckel_2004@548.75:551.35 I HOPE YOU WILL ENJOY WE HAVE ONE HERE
AlSeckel_2004@552.47:554.06 TED AND HAPPINESS
AlSeckel_2004@580.71:583.42 SO WE SCOTT CREATED THIS WONDERFUL
AlSeckel_2004@596.68:598.51 WELL THERE'S ANALOG AND DIGITAL
AlSeckel_2004@611.22:612.69 FIGURE GOES TO GROUND
AlSeckel_2004@625.74:627.18 AND FOR THE MUSICIANS
AlSeckel_2004@646.53:649.85 AND OF COURSE SINCE HAPPINESS WE WANT JOY TO THE WORLD
AlSeckel_2004@658.66:661.83 NOW ANOTHER GREAT DESIGNER HE 'S VERY WELL KNOWN IN JAPAN
AlSeckel_2004@665.13:668.82 AND HE JUST BUILDS SOME FANTASTIC THINGS THIS IS SIMPLY AMAZING
AlSeckel_2004@670.29:671.69 THIS IS A PILE OF JUNK
AlSeckel_2004@674.71:677.27 THAT WHEN YOU VIEW IT FROM ONE PARTICULAR ANGLE
AlSeckel_2004@683.32:686.12 YOU SEE ITS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR AS A PERFECT PIANO
AlSeckel_2004@711.52:712.56 TO VIOLINIST
AlSeckel_2004@715.42:716.71 THIS IS REALLY WILD
AlSeckel_2004@719.11:724.44 THIS ASSEMBLAGE OF FORKS KNIVES AND SPOONS AND VARIOUS CUTLERY WELDED TOGETHER
AlSeckel_2004@731.33:732.72 A SHADOW OF A MOTORCYCLE
AlSeckel_2004@736.03:742.21 YOU LEARN SOMETHING IN THE SORT OF THING THAT I DO WHICH IS THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH A LOT OF TIME ON THEIR HANDS
AlSeckel_2004@747.16:750.32 KEN KNOWLTON DOES WONDERFUL COMPOSITE IMAGES
AlSeckel_2004@752.13:757.44 LIKE CREATING JACQUES COUSTEAU OUT OF SEASHELLS UN RETOUCHED SEASHELLS BUT JUST BY REARRANGING THEM
AlSeckel_2004@758.29:760.31 HE DID EINSTEIN OUT OF DICE
AlSeckel_2004@760.71:764.81 BECAUSE AFTER ALL EINSTEIN SAID GOD DOES NOT PLAY DICE WITH THE UNIVERSE
AlSeckel_2004@766.64:769.37 OUT OF UN RETOUCHED KEYBOARDS
AlSeckel_2004@770.13:771.77 WILL SHORTZ CROSSWORD PUZZLE
AlSeckel_2004@773.84:776.89 JOHN CEDERQUIST DOES THESE WONDERFUL TROMPE
AlSeckel_2004@779.68:785.60 I'M GOING TO SKIP AHEAD SINCE I'M SORT OF RUNNING I WANT TO SHOW YOU QUICKLY WHAT I'VE CREATED
AlSeckel_2004@787.66:796.34 SOME NEW TYPE OF ILLUSIONS I'VE DONE SOMETHING WITH TAKING THE PIXAR TYPE ILLUSIONS SO YOU SEE THESE KIDS THE SAME SIZE HERE
AlSeckel_2004@797.84:807.03 RUNNING DOWN THE HALL THE TWO TABLE TOPS OF THE SAME SIZE THEY'RE LOOKING OUT TWO DIRECTIONS AT ONCE YOU HAVE A LARGER PIECE FITTING IN WITH A SMALLER
AlSeckel_2004@811.84:817.66 AND THAT'S SOMETHING FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT ALL RIGHT SO YOU SEE LARGER PIECES FITTING IN WITHIN SMALLER PIECES HERE
AlSeckel_2004@823.65:828.40 YOU CAN SEE THE TWO KIDS ARE LOOKING OUT SIMULTANEOUSLY OUT OF TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AT ONCE
AlSeckel_2004@832.49:836.30 NOW CAN YOU BELIEVE THESE TWO TABLE TOPS ARE THE SAME SIZE AND SHAPE
AlSeckel_2004@837.26:839.77 THEY ARE SO IF YOU MEASURED THEM THEY WOULD BE
AlSeckel_2004@843.07:846.73 AS I SAY THOSE TWO FIGURES ARE IDENTICAL IN SIZE AND SHAPE
AlSeckel_2004@849.97:851.18 INTERESTING BY DOING
AlSeckel_2004@853.64:863.14 THIS IN THIS SORT OF RENDERED FASHION HOW MUCH STRONGER THESE ILLUSIONS ARE ANY CASE I HOPE THIS HAS BROUGHT YOU A LITTLE JOY AND HAPPINESS AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SEEING MORE COOL EFFECTS
