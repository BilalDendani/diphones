JessaGamble_2010G@16.98:18.51 START WITH DAY AND NIGHT
JessaGamble_2010G@18.63:30.5 LIFE EVOLVED UNDER CONDITIONS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS LIGHT AND THEN DARKNESS AND SO PLANTS AND ANIMALS DEVELOPED THEIR OWN INTERNAL CLOCKS SO THAT THEY WOULD BE READY FOR THESE CHANGES IN LIGHT
JessaGamble_2010G@30.86:37.98 THESE ARE CHEMICAL CLOCKS AND THEY 'RE FOUND IN EVERY KNOWN BEING THAT HAS TWO OR MORE CELLS AND IN SOME THAT ONLY HAVE ONE CELL
JessaGamble_2010G@38.49:46.89 I 'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE IF YOU TAKE A HORSESHOE CRAB OFF THE BEACH AND YOU FLY IT ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE CONTINENT AND YOU DROP IT INTO A SLOPED CAGE
JessaGamble_2010G@46.92:57.54 IT WILL SCRAMBLE UP THE FLOOR OF THE CAGE AS THE TIDE IS RISING ON ITS HOME SHORES AND IT 'LL SKITTER DOWN AGAIN RIGHT AS THE WATER IS RECEDING THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY
JessaGamble_2010G@63.36:73.4 AND IT 'S INCREDIBLE TO WATCH BUT THERE 'S NOTHING PSYCHIC OR PARANORMAL GOING ON IT 'S SIMPLY THAT THESE CRABS HAVE INTERNAL CYCLES THAT CORRESPOND USUALLY WITH WHAT 'S GOING ON AROUND IT
JessaGamble_2010G@94.22:113.61 SO NO MATTER HOW ATYPICAL THESE SUBJECTS WOULD HAVE TO BE THEY ALL SHOW THE SAME THING THEY GET UP JUST A LITTLE BIT LATER EVERY DAY SAY FIFTEEN MINUTES OR SO AND THEY KIND OF DRIFT ALL THE WAY AROUND THE CLOCK LIKE THIS OVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEKS AND SO IN THIS WAY WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON THEIR OWN INTERNAL CLOCKS RATHER THAN SOMEHOW SENSING THE DAY OUTSIDE
JessaGamble_2010G@114.1:121.15 SO FINE WE HAVE A BODY CLOCK AND IT TURNS OUT THAT IT 'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IN OUR LIVES IT 'S A HUGE DRIVER FOR CULTURE
JessaGamble_2010G@121.21:125.14 AND I THINK THAT IT 'S THE MOST UNDERRATED FORCE ON OUR BEHAVIOR
JessaGamble_2010G@127.36:134.64 WE EVOLVED AS A SPECIES NEAR THE EQUATOR AND SO WE 'RE VERY WELL EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH TWELVE HOURS OF DAYLIGHT AND TWELVE HOURS OF DARKNESS
JessaGamble_2010G@134.9:139.33 BUT OF COURSE WE 'VE SPREAD TO EVERY CORNER OF THE GLOBE AND IN ARCTIC CANADA WHERE I LIVE
JessaGamble_2010G@139.33:149.96 WE HAVE PERPETUAL DAYLIGHT IN SUMMER AND TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF DARKNESS IN WINTER SO THE CULTURE THE NORTHERN ABORIGINAL CULTURE TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN HIGHLY SEASONAL IN WINTER
JessaGamble_2010G@149.96:159.99 THERE 'S A LOT OF SLEEPING GOING ON YOU ENJOY YOUR FAMILY LIFE INSIDE AND IN SUMMER IT 'S ALMOST MANIC HUNTING AND WORKING ACTIVITY VERY LONG HOURS
JessaGamble_2010G@167.34:169.16 IN THE SORT OF IDEAL SENSE
JessaGamble_2010G@192.84:198.85 AND DURING THIS TIME THERE 'S A SURGE OF PROLACTIN THE LIKES OF WHICH A MODERN DAY NEVER SEES
JessaGamble_2010G@198.95:200.77 THE PEOPLE IN THESE STUDIES
JessaGamble_2010G@201.05:205.06 REPORT FEELING SO AWAKE DURING THE DAYTIME THAT THEY REALIZE
JessaGamble_2010G@205.14:207.94 THEY 'RE EXPERIENCING TRUE WAKEFULNESS FOR THE FIRST TIME
JessaGamble_2010G@217.81:219.33 SHIFT WORK
JessaGamble_2010G@220.02:227.09 AND YOU KNOW OUR MODERN WAYS OF DOING THINGS HAVE THEIR ADVANTAGES
JessaGamble_2010G@227.69:232 BUT I BELIEVE WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE COSTS THANK YOU
