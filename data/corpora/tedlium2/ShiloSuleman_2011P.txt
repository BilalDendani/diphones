ShiloSuleman_2011P@32.67:41.7 SO BACK IN THE DAY WHEN US INDIANS WANTED TO TRAVEL WE 'D JUMP INTO A CHARIOT AND WE 'D ZOOM ACROSS THE SKY NOW WE DO THE SAME WITH AIRPLANES
ShiloSuleman_2011P@41.7:54.97 BACK THEN WHEN ARJUNA THE GREAT INDIAN WARRIOR PRINCE WHEN HE WAS THIRSTY HE 'D TAKE OUT A BOW HE 'D SHOOT IT INTO THE GROUND AND WATER WOULD COME OUT NOW WE DO THE SAME WITH DRILLS AND MACHINES
ShiloSuleman_2011P@60.31:63.15 AND THIS MADE ME REALLY SAD
ShiloSuleman_2011P@63.15:75.71 I FOUND MYSELF BECOMING A LITTLE BIT OF A TECHNOPHOBE I WAS TERRIFIED BY THIS IDEA THAT I WOULD LOSE THE ABILITY TO ENJOY AND APPRECIATE THE SUNSET WITHOUT HAVING MY CAMERA ON ME WITHOUT TWEETING IT TO MY FRIENDS
ShiloSuleman_2011P@96.88:112.53 SO I FELT LIKE OUR CELLPHONES AND OUR FANCY WATCHES AND OUR CAMERAS HAD STOPPED US FROM DREAMING THEY STOPPED US FROM BEING INSPIRED AND SO I JUMPED IN I JUMPED INTO THIS WORLD OF TECHNOLOGY TO SEE HOW I COULD USE IT TO ENABLE MAGIC AS OPPOSED TO KILL IT
ShiloSuleman_2011P@112.53:132.02 I 'VE BEEN ILLUSTRATING BOOKS SINCE I WAS SIXTEEN AND SO WHEN I SAW THE IPAD I SAW IT AS A STORYTELLING DEVICE THAT COULD CONNECT READERS ALL OVER THE WORLD IT CAN KNOW HOW WE 'RE HOLDING IT IT CAN KNOW WHERE WE ARE IT BRINGS TOGETHER IMAGE AND TEXT AND ANIMATION AND SOUND
ShiloSuleman_2011P@132.02:137.11 STORYTELLING IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE MULTI SENSORIAL BUT WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH IT
ShiloSuleman_2011P@140.82:144.27 AN INTERACTIVE APP FOR THE IPAD
ShiloSuleman_2011P@262.31:269.75 ANOTHER THING THAT 'S ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME IS CREATING CONTENT THAT IS INDIAN AND YET VERY CONTEMPORARY
ShiloSuleman_2011P@329.71:349.29 I THINK A BIG PROBLEM HAS BEEN IN THE LAST TEN YEARS IS THAT CHILDREN HAVE BEEN LOCKED INSIDE THEIR ROOMS GLUED TO THEIR PCS THEY HAVEN 'T BEEN ABLE TO GET OUT BUT NOW WITH MOBILE TECHNOLOGY WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE OUR CHILDREN OUTSIDE INTO THE NATURAL WORLD WITH THEIR TECHNOLOGY ONE OF THE INTERACTIONS IN THE BOOK IS THAT YOU 'RE SENT OFF ON THIS QUEST WHERE YOU NEED TO GO OUTSIDE
ShiloSuleman_2011P@349.29:353.87 TAKE OUT YOUR CAMERA ON THE IPAD AND COLLECT PICTURES OF DIFFERENT NATURAL OBJECTS
ShiloSuleman_2011P@353.87:367.06 WHEN I WAS A CHILD I HAD MULTIPLE COLLECTIONS OF STICKS AND STONES AND PEBBLES AND SHELLS AND SOMEHOW KIDS DON 'T DO THAT ANYMORE SO IN BRINGING BACK THIS CHILDHOOD RITUAL YOU NEED TO GO OUT AND IN ONE CHAPTER TAKE A PICTURE OF A FLOWER
ShiloSuleman_2011P@368.85:378.64 AND THEN TAG IT IN ANOTHER CHAPTER YOU NEED TO TAKE A PICTURE OF A PIECE OF BARK AND THEN TAG THAT AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU ACTUALLY CREATE A DIGITAL COLLECTION OF PHOTOGRAPHS THAT YOU CAN THEN PUT UP ONLINE
ShiloSuleman_2011P@378.64:390.46 A CHILD IN LONDON PUTS UP A PICTURE OF A FOX AND SAYS OH I SAW A FOX TODAY A CHILD IN INDIA SAYS I SAW A MONKEY TODAY AND IT CREATES THIS KIND OF SOCIAL NETWORK AROUND A COLLECTION OF DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHS THAT YOU 'VE ACTUALLY TAKEN
ShiloSuleman_2011P@415.63:418.78 AND BLOW THEM AWAY AND READ THE REST OF THE BOOK
ShiloSuleman_2011P@418.78:429.5 WE 'RE MOVING WE 'RE ALL MOVING HERE TO A WORLD WHERE THE FORCES OF NATURE COME CLOSER TOGETHER TO TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC AND TECHNOLOGY CAN COME CLOSER TOGETHER
