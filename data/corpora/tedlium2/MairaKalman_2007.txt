MairaKalman_2007@12.98:15.52 WHAT I AM ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT
MairaKalman_2007@16.83:24.91 IS WHAT THIS SESSION IS ABOUT WHICH IS CALLED SIMPLICITY AND ALMOST I WOULD ALMOST CALL IT BEING SIMPLE MINDED BUT IN THE BEST SENSE OF THE WORD
MairaKalman_2007@30.58:41.97 HOW TO DIE PERIOD THAT'S ALL I'M TRYING TO DO ALL DAY LONG AND I'M ALSO TRYING TO HAVE SOME MEALS AND HAVE SOME SNACKS AND YOU KNOW AND YELL AT MY CHILDREN AND DO ALL THE NORMAL THINGS THAT KEEP YOU GROUNDED
MairaKalman_2007@43.19:55.53 SO I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE BORN A VERY DREAMY CHILD MY OLDER SISTER WAS BUSY TORTURING MY PARENTS AND THEY WERE BUSY TORTURING HER
MairaKalman_2007@57.17:65.93 I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE COMPLETELY IGNORED WHICH IS A FABULOUS THING ACTUALLY I WANT TO TELL YOU SO I WAS ABLE TO COMPLETELY DAYDREAM MY WAY THROUGH MY LIFE
MairaKalman_2007@74.19:84.27 WHERE I MET A MAN WHO WAS TRYING TO BLOW UP THE MATH BUILDING OF NYU AND I WAS WRITING TERRIBLE POETRY AND KNITTING SWEATERS FOR HIM
MairaKalman_2007@84.89:90.85 AND FEMINISTS HATED US AND THE WHOLE THING WAS WRETCHED FROM BEGINNING TO END BUT
MairaKalman_2007@91.43:99.93 I KEPT WRITING BAD POETRY AND HE DIDN'T BLOW UP THE MATH BUILDING BUT HE WENT TO CUBA BUT I GAVE HIM THE MONEY BECAUSE I WAS FROM RIVERDALE SO I HAD MORE MONEY THAN HE DID
MairaKalman_2007@101.13:107.55 AND THAT WAS A GOOD THING TO HELP THE YOU KNOW THE CAUSE BUT THEN HE CAME BACK
MairaKalman_2007@108.12:115.71 AND THINGS HAPPENED AND I DECIDED I REALLY HATED MY WRITING THAT IT WAS AWFUL AWFUL PURPLE PROSE
MairaKalman_2007@116.56:126.74 AND I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO TELL BUT I STILL WANTED TO TELL A NARRATIVE STORY AND I STILL WANTED TO TELL MY STORIES SO I DECIDED THAT I WOULD START TO DRAW HOW HARD COULD THAT BE AND SO
MairaKalman_2007@128.57:137.59 WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT I STARTED JUST BECOMING AN EDITORIAL ILLUSTRATOR THROUGH YOU KNOW SHEER WHATEVER SHEER IGNORANCE AND WE STARTED A
MairaKalman_2007@149.66:163.21 IF YOU KNOW TOO MUCH YOU'RE STYMIED SO THE PREMISE IN THE STUDIO WAS THERE ARE NO BOUNDARIES THERE IS NO FEAR AND I AND MY FULL TIME JOB I LANDED THE BEST JOB ON EARTH WAS TO DAYDREAM AND TO ACTUALLY COME UP
MairaKalman_2007@163.60:171.27 WITH ABSURD IDEAS THAT FORTUNATELY THERE WERE ENOUGH PEOPLE THERE AND IT WAS A TEAM IT WAS A COLLECTIVE IT WAS NOT JUST ME COMING UP WITH CRAZY IDEAS BUT
MairaKalman_2007@171.67:184.73 THE POINT WAS THAT I WAS THERE AS MYSELF AS A DREAMER AND SO SOME OF THE THINGS I MEAN IT WAS A LONG HISTORY OF M COMPANY AND CLEARLY WE ALSO NEEDED TO MAKE SOME MONEY SO WE DECIDED
MairaKalman_2007@185.49:194.91 WE WOULD CREATE A SERIES OF PRODUCTS AND SOME OF THE WATCHES THERE ATTEMPTING TO BE BEAUTIFUL AND HUMOROUS MAYBE NOT ATTEMPTING HOPEFULLY SUCCEEDING
MairaKalman_2007@195.54:203.99 THAT TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT CONTENT TO BREAK APART WHAT YOU NORMALLY EXPECT TO USE HUMOR AND SURPRISE ELEGANCE AND
MairaKalman_2007@204.73:214.13 HUMANITY IN YOUR WORK WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US IT WAS A VERY HIGH IT WAS A VERY IMPERSONAL TIME IN DESIGN AND WE WANTED TO SAY
MairaKalman_2007@214.54:225.76 THE CONTENT IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOT THE PACKAGE NOT THE WRAPPING YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE JOURNALISTS YOU HAVE TO BE INVENTORS YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR IMAGINATION MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN ANYTHING SO
MairaKalman_2007@227.44:234.70 THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT I HAVE A DOG AND THOUGH I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE IN LUCK I DON'T KNOW WHAT I BELIEVE IN IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED QUESTION BUT

MairaKalman_2007@294.36:297.40 IN WRITING FOR CHILDREN IT SEEMS SIMPLE
MairaKalman_2007@298.11:306.39 AND IT IS YOU HAVE TO CONDENSE A STORY INTO THIRTY TWO PAGES USUALLY AND WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS YOU REALLY HAVE TO EDIT DOWN TO WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY AND HOPEFULLY
