MairaKalman_2007 WHAT I AM ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT
MairaKalman_2007 IS WHAT THIS SESSION IS ABOUT WHICH IS CALLED SIMPLICITY AND ALMOST I WOULD ALMOST CALL IT BEING SIMPLE MINDED BUT IN THE BEST SENSE OF THE WORD
MairaKalman_2007 HOW TO DIE PERIOD THAT'S ALL I'M TRYING TO DO ALL DAY LONG AND I'M ALSO TRYING TO HAVE SOME MEALS AND HAVE SOME SNACKS AND YOU KNOW AND YELL AT MY CHILDREN AND DO ALL THE NORMAL THINGS THAT KEEP YOU GROUNDED
MairaKalman_2007 SO I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE BORN A VERY DREAMY CHILD MY OLDER SISTER WAS BUSY TORTURING MY PARENTS AND THEY WERE BUSY TORTURING HER
MairaKalman_2007 I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE COMPLETELY IGNORED WHICH IS A FABULOUS THING ACTUALLY I WANT TO TELL YOU SO I WAS ABLE TO COMPLETELY DAYDREAM MY WAY THROUGH MY LIFE
MairaKalman_2007 WHERE I MET A MAN WHO WAS TRYING TO BLOW UP THE MATH BUILDING OF NYU AND I WAS WRITING TERRIBLE POETRY AND KNITTING SWEATERS FOR HIM
MairaKalman_2007 AND FEMINISTS HATED US AND THE WHOLE THING WAS WRETCHED FROM BEGINNING TO END BUT
MairaKalman_2007 I KEPT WRITING BAD POETRY AND HE DIDN'T BLOW UP THE MATH BUILDING BUT HE WENT TO CUBA BUT I GAVE HIM THE MONEY BECAUSE I WAS FROM RIVERDALE SO I HAD MORE MONEY THAN HE DID
MairaKalman_2007 AND THAT WAS A GOOD THING TO HELP THE YOU KNOW THE CAUSE BUT THEN HE CAME BACK
MairaKalman_2007 AND THINGS HAPPENED AND I DECIDED I REALLY HATED MY WRITING THAT IT WAS AWFUL AWFUL PURPLE PROSE
MairaKalman_2007 AND I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO TELL BUT I STILL WANTED TO TELL A NARRATIVE STORY AND I STILL WANTED TO TELL MY STORIES SO I DECIDED THAT I WOULD START TO DRAW HOW HARD COULD THAT BE AND SO
MairaKalman_2007 WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT I STARTED JUST BECOMING AN EDITORIAL ILLUSTRATOR THROUGH YOU KNOW SHEER WHATEVER SHEER IGNORANCE AND WE STARTED A
MairaKalman_2007 IF YOU KNOW TOO MUCH YOU'RE STYMIED SO THE PREMISE IN THE STUDIO WAS THERE ARE NO BOUNDARIES THERE IS NO FEAR AND I AND MY FULL TIME JOB I LANDED THE BEST JOB ON EARTH WAS TO DAYDREAM AND TO ACTUALLY COME UP
MairaKalman_2007 WITH ABSURD IDEAS THAT FORTUNATELY THERE WERE ENOUGH PEOPLE THERE AND IT WAS A TEAM IT WAS A COLLECTIVE IT WAS NOT JUST ME COMING UP WITH CRAZY IDEAS BUT
MairaKalman_2007 THE POINT WAS THAT I WAS THERE AS MYSELF AS A DREAMER AND SO SOME OF THE THINGS I MEAN IT WAS A LONG HISTORY OF M COMPANY AND CLEARLY WE ALSO NEEDED TO MAKE SOME MONEY SO WE DECIDED
MairaKalman_2007 WE WOULD CREATE A SERIES OF PRODUCTS AND SOME OF THE WATCHES THERE ATTEMPTING TO BE BEAUTIFUL AND HUMOROUS MAYBE NOT ATTEMPTING HOPEFULLY SUCCEEDING
MairaKalman_2007 THAT TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT CONTENT TO BREAK APART WHAT YOU NORMALLY EXPECT TO USE HUMOR AND SURPRISE ELEGANCE AND
MairaKalman_2007 HUMANITY IN YOUR WORK WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US IT WAS A VERY HIGH IT WAS A VERY IMPERSONAL TIME IN DESIGN AND WE WANTED TO SAY
MairaKalman_2007 THE CONTENT IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOT THE PACKAGE NOT THE WRAPPING YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE JOURNALISTS YOU HAVE TO BE INVENTORS YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR IMAGINATION MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN ANYTHING SO
MairaKalman_2007 THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT I HAVE A DOG AND THOUGH I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE IN LUCK I DON'T KNOW WHAT I BELIEVE IN IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED QUESTION BUT
MairaKalman_2007 I DO KNOW THAT BEFORE I GO AWAY I CRANK HIS TAIL SEVEN TIMES SO WHENEVER HE SEES A SUITCASE IN THE HOUSE BECAUSE EVERYBODY 'S ALWAYS YOU KNOW LEAVING THEY'RE ALWAYS CRANKING THIS WONDERFUL DOG 'S TAIL AND HE RUNS TO THE OTHER ROOM BUT
MairaKalman_2007 I AM ABLE TO MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM WORKING FOR CHILDREN AND FROM WORKING FOR ADULTS TO CHILDREN AND BACK AND FORTH BECAUSE YOU KNOW I CAN SAY THAT I'M IMMATURE AND IN A WAY
MairaKalman_2007 TRUE I DON'T REALLY I MEAN I COULD TELL YOU THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
MairaKalman_2007 I'M NOT PROUD OF IT BUT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND LET 'S SAY NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE TALKS AT THIS CONFERENCE BUT I HAVE BEEN TAKING BEAUTIFUL NOTES OF DRAWINGS AND I HAVE A GORGEOUS ONION FROM
MairaKalman_2007 'S TALK AND I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL PAGE OF DOODLES FROM JONATHAN WOODHAM 'S TALK SO GOOD THINGS COME OUT OF YOU KNOW INCOMPREHENSION
MairaKalman_2007 WHICH I WILL DO A PAINTING OF AND THEN IT WILL END UP IN MY WORK SO I'M OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITIES OF NOT KNOWING AND FINDING OUT SOMETHING NEW SO
MairaKalman_2007 IN WRITING FOR CHILDREN IT SEEMS SIMPLE
MairaKalman_2007 AND IT IS YOU HAVE TO CONDENSE A STORY INTO THIRTY TWO PAGES USUALLY AND WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS YOU REALLY HAVE TO EDIT DOWN TO WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY AND HOPEFULLY
MairaKalman_2007 NOT TALKING DOWN TO KIDS AND YOU'RE NOT TALKING IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU YOU KNOW COULDN'T STAND READING IT AFTER ONE TIME SO I HOPEFULLY AM WRITING YOU KNOW BOOKS THAT ARE GOOD FOR CHILDREN AND FOR ADULTS
MairaKalman_2007 THE PAINTING REFLECTS I DON'T THINK DIFFERENTLY FOR CHILDREN THAN I DO FOR ADULTS I TRY TO USE THE SAME KIND OF IMAGINATION THE SAME KIND OF WHIMSY THE SAME KIND OF LOVE OF LANGUAGE SO
MairaKalman_2007 YOU KNOW AND I HAVE LOTS OF WONDERFUL LOOKING FRIENDS THIS IS ANDREW GATZ AND HE WALKED IN THROUGH THE DOOR AND I SAID YOU SIT DOWN THERE YOU KNOW I TAKE LOTS OF PHOTOS AND THE BERTOIA CHAIR IN THE BACKGROUND IS MY FAVORITE CHAIR SO
MairaKalman_2007 I GET TO PUT IN ALL OF THE THINGS THAT I LOVE HOPEFULLY A DIALOG BETWEEN ADULTS AND CHILDREN WILL HAPPEN ON MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS AND HOPEFULLY DIFFERENT DIFFERENT KINDS OF HUMOR WILL EVOLVE AND THE BOOKS ARE REALLY JOURNALS OF MY LIFE I NEVER
MairaKalman_2007 BECAUSE MY LIFE IS TOO RANDOM AND TOO CONFUSED AND I ENJOY IT THAT WAY BUT ANYWAY SO I WAS IN WE WERE IN VENICE
MairaKalman_2007 AND THIS IS OUR ROOM AND I HAD THIS DREAM THAT I WAS WEARING THIS FANTASTIC GREEN GOWN AND I WAS LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AND IT WAS REALLY A BEAUTIFUL THING AND SO I WAS ABLE TO PUT THAT INTO THIS
MairaKalman_2007 WELL HE HAS SOME HAIR BUT WELL HE USED TO HAVE HAIR AND WITH HIM I WAS ABLE TO DO A PROJECT THAT WAS REALLY FANTASTIC I WORK FOR THE NEW YORKER AND I DO COVERS AND
MairaKalman_2007 NINE ELEVEN HAPPENED AND IT WAS YOU KNOW A COMPLETE AND UTTER END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNEW IT

MairaKalman_2007 WE HOPED WE'D BE FUNNY BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD BE A COVER AND WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT IMAGE AT THE MOMENT THAT IT HAPPENED WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE SO WONDERFUL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND IT REALLY BECAME THE

MairaKalman_2007 IN THE COURSE OF MY LIFE I NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND THAT'S KIND OF THE BEAUTY PART AND WE WERE ON CAPE COD A PLACE OBVIOUSLY OF GREAT INSPIRATION AND I PICKED UP THIS BOOK
MairaKalman_2007 THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE AT A YARD SALE AND I DIDN'T AND I'D NEVER USED IT IN SCHOOL BECAUSE I WAS TOO BUSY WRITING POEMS AND FLUNKING OUT AND
MairaKalman_2007 I DON'T KNOW WHAT SITTING IN CAFES BUT I PICKED IT UP AND I STARTED READING IT AND I THOUGHT THIS BOOK IS AMAZING I SAID WHO PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS BOOK SO

MairaKalman_2007 WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE VERY VERY QUIET AND IT WAS A PHENOMENALLY WONDERFUL EVENT WHICH WE HOPEFULLY WILL DO SOME MORE

MairaKalman_2007 AND I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY VERY DARK DAY WHEN THE BOLSHEVIKS ARRIVED MAYBE AMONGST THEMSELVES THEY HAD A FEW GOOD LAUGHS BUT STALIN WAS A PARANOID MAN EVEN MORE THAN MY FATHER
MairaKalman_2007 YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW AND
MairaKalman_2007 'S FAMILY FLED RUSSIA HOW COULD THE YOUNG NABOKOV SITTING INNOCENTLY AND ELEGANTLY IN A RED CHAIR LEAFING THROUGH A BOOK AND BUTTERFLIES IMAGINE SUCH DISPLACEMENT SUCH LOSS
MairaKalman_2007 AND THEN I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THIS IS A MAP SO MY BEAUTIFUL MOTHER 'S FAMILY FLED RUSSIA AS WELL TOO MANY POGROMS LEAVING THE SHACK THE WILD BLUEBERRY WOODS THE GEESE
