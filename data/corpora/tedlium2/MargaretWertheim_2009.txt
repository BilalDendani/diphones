MargaretWertheim_2009 TODAY AS JUNE SAID TO TALK ABOUT A PROJECT THAT MY TWIN SISTER AND I HAVE BEEN DOING FOR THE PAST THREE AND HALF YEARS WE'RE CROCHETING A CORAL REEF
MargaretWertheim_2009 AND IT'S A PROJECT THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN NOW JOINED BY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE DOING IT WITH US INDEED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT IN MANY OF ITS DIFFERENT ASPECTS
MargaretWertheim_2009 IT'S A PROJECT THAT NOW REACHES ACROSS THREE CONTINENTS ITS ROOTS GO INTO THE FIELDS OF MATHEMATICS MARINE BIOLOGY FEMININE HANDICRAFT
MargaretWertheim_2009 WHICH IS A PARTICULARLY LOVELY THING TO BE SAYING RIGHT HERE IN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WHICH AS ONE OF OUR PREVIOUS SPEAKERS TOLD US IS THE TWO HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF
MargaretWertheim_2009 ALL OF THIS I'M GOING TO GET TO IN THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MINUTES I HOPE BUT LET ME FIRST BEGIN BY SHOWING YOU SOME PICTURES OF WHAT THIS THING LOOKS LIKE
MargaretWertheim_2009 JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF SCALE THAT INSTALLATION THERE IS ABOUT SIX FEET ACROSS AND THE TALLEST MODELS ARE ABOUT
MargaretWertheim_2009 TWO OR THREE FEET HIGH THIS IS SOME MORE IMAGES OF IT THAT ONE ON THE RIGHT IS ABOUT FIVE FEET HIGH THE WORK INVOLVES HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT CROCHET MODELS
MargaretWertheim_2009 AND INDEED THERE ARE NOW THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MODELS THAT PEOPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED ALL OVER THE WORLD AS PART OF
MargaretWertheim_2009 THE TOTALITY OF THIS PROJECT INVOLVES TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF HUMAN LABOR NINETY NINE PERCENT OF IT DONE BY WOMEN ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE THAT BIT THERE IS PART OF AN INSTALLATION
MargaretWertheim_2009 THAT IS ABOUT TWELVE FEET LONG MY SISTER AND I STARTED THIS PROJECT IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE BECAUSE IN THAT YEAR AT LEAST IN THE SCIENCE PRESS THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING AND THE EFFECT THAT GLOBAL WARMING WAS HAVING ON CORAL REEFS
MargaretWertheim_2009 VERY DELICATE ORGANISMS AND THEY ARE DEVASTATED BY ANY RISE IN SEA TEMPERATURES IT CAUSES THESE VAST BLEACHING EVENTS THAT ARE THE FIRST SIGNS OF CORALS OF BEING SICK AND IF THE BLEACHING DOESN'T GO AWAY IF THE TEMPERATURES DON'T GO DOWN
MargaretWertheim_2009 REEFS START TO DIE A GREAT DEAL OF THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN THE GREAT BARRIER REEF PARTICULARLY IN CORAL REEFS ALL OVER THE WORLD THIS IS OUR INVOCATION IN CROCHET OF A BLEACHED
MargaretWertheim_2009 WE HAVE A NEW ORGANIZATION TOGETHER CALLED THE INSTITUTE FOR FIGURING WHICH IS A LITTLE ORGANIZATION WE STARTED TO PROMOTE
MargaretWertheim_2009 TO DO PROJECTS ABOUT AESTHETIC AND POETIC DIMENSIONS OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS AND I WENT AND PUT A LITTLE ANNOUNCEMENT UP ON OUR SITE ASKING FOR PEOPLE TO JOIN US IN THIS ENTERPRISE
MargaretWertheim_2009 TO OUR SURPRISE ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE WHO CALLED WAS THE ANDY WARHOL MUSEUM AND THEY SAID THEY WERE HAVING AN EXHIBITION ABOUT ARTISTS RESPONSE TO GLOBAL WARMING AND THEY'D LIKE OUR CORAL REEF TO BE PART OF IT I LAUGHED AND SAID WELL WE'VE ONLY JUST STARTED IT YOU CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF IT
MargaretWertheim_2009 SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN WE HAD AN EXHIBITION A SMALL EXHIBITION OF THIS CROCHET REEF AND THEN SOME PEOPLE IN CHICAGO CAME ALONG AND THEY SAID IN LATE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THE THEME OF THE CHICAGO HUMANITIES FESTIVAL
MargaretWertheim_2009 IS GLOBAL WARMING AND WE'VE GOT THIS THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT GALLERY AND WE WANT YOU TO FILL IT WITH YOUR REEF AND I NAIVELY BY THIS STAGE SAID OH YES SURE
MargaretWertheim_2009 NOW I SAY NAIVELY BECAUSE ACTUALLY MY PROFESSION IS AS A SCIENCE WRITER WHAT I DO IS I WRITE BOOKS ABOUT THE CULTURAL HISTORY OF PHYSICS
MargaretWertheim_2009 I'VE WRITTEN BOOKS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF SPACE THE HISTORY OF PHYSICS AND RELIGION AND I WRITE ARTICLES FOR PEOPLE LIKE THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE L A TIMES SO I HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT MEANT TO FILL A THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT GALLERY
MargaretWertheim_2009 SO I SAID YES TO THIS PROPOSITION AND I WENT HOME AND I TOLD MY SISTER CHRISTINE AND SHE NEARLY HAD A FIT BECAUSE CHRISTINE IS A PROFESSOR AT ONE OF L A S MAJOR ART COLLEGES CALARTS
MargaretWertheim_2009 EIGHT MONTHS LATER WE DID FILL
MargaretWertheim_2009 THE CHICAGO CULTURAL CENTER 'S THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT GALLERY BY THIS STAGE THE PROJECT HAD TAKEN ON A VIRAL DIMENSION OF ITS OWN WHICH GOT COMPLETELY BEYOND
MargaretWertheim_2009 THE PEOPLE IN CHICAGO DECIDED THAT AS WELL AS EXHIBITING OUR REEFS WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO WAS HAVE THE LOCAL PEOPLE THERE MAKE A REEF SO WE WENT
MargaretWertheim_2009 WE DID WORKSHOPS AND LECTURES AND THE PEOPLE IN CHICAGO MADE A REEF OF THEIR OWN AND IT WAS EXHIBITED ALONGSIDE OURS THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THAT
MargaretWertheim_2009 WE GOT INVITED TO DO THE WHOLE THING IN NEW YORK AND IN LONDON AND IN LOS ANGELES IN EACH OF THESE CITIES THE LOCAL CITIZENS HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THEM HAVE MADE REEFS AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE GET INVOLVED IN THIS MOST OF WHOM
MargaretWertheim_2009 WE'VE NEVER MET SO THE WHOLE THING HAS SORT OF MORPHED INTO THIS ORGANIC EVER EVOLVING CREATURE THAT'S ACTUALLY GONE WAY BEYOND CHRISTINE AND I
MargaretWertheim_2009 THESE PEOPLE ON WHY ON EARTH ARE YOU CROCHETING A REEF WOOLENNESS AND WETNESS AREN'T EXACTLY TWO CONCEPTS THAT GO TOGETHER
MargaretWertheim_2009 A CORAL REEF OUT OF MARBLE CAST IT IN BRONZE BUT IT TURNS OUT THERE IS A VERY GOOD REASON WHY WE ARE CROCHETING IT
MargaretWertheim_2009 BECAUSE MANY ORGANISMS IN CORAL REEFS HAVE A VERY PARTICULAR KIND OF STRUCTURE THE FRILLY CRINOLATED FORMS THAT YOU SEE IN CORALS AND KELPS AND SPONGES AND NUDIBRANCHS IS A FORM OF GEOMETRY KNOWN AS HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY
MargaretWertheim_2009 AND THE ONLY WAY THAT MATHEMATICIANS KNOW HOW TO MODEL THIS STRUCTURE IS WITH CROCHET IT HAPPENS TO BE A FACT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MODEL THIS STRUCTURE ANY OTHER WAY AND IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO IT ON COMPUTERS
MargaretWertheim_2009 SO WHAT IS THIS HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY THAT CORALS AND SEA SLUGS EMBODY THE NEXT FEW MINUTES IS WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET RAISED UP TO THE LEVEL OF A SEA SLUG
MargaretWertheim_2009 THIS SORT OF GEOMETRY REVOLUTIONIZED MATHEMATICS WHEN IT WAS FIRST DISCOVERED IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
MargaretWertheim_2009 WHAT SHE WAS DOING WAS ACTUALLY MAKING A MODEL OF A MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE THAT MANY MATHEMATICIANS HAD THOUGHT IT WAS ACTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO MODEL
MargaretWertheim_2009 INDEED THEY THOUGHT THAT ANYTHING LIKE THIS STRUCTURE WAS IMPOSSIBLE PER SE SOME OF THE BEST MATHEMATICIANS SPENT HUNDREDS OF YEARS TRYING TO PROVE THAT THIS STRUCTURE WAS IMPOSSIBLE
MargaretWertheim_2009 SO WHAT IS THIS IMPOSSIBLE HYPERBOLIC STRUCTURE BEFORE HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY MATHEMATICIANS KNEW ABOUT TWO KINDS OF SPACE EUCLIDEAN SPACE AND SPHERICAL SPACE AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES
MargaretWertheim_2009 AND WHAT THEY DO IS THEY DO IT THROUGH THE CONCEPT OF PARALLEL LINES SO HERE WE HAVE A LINE AND A POINT OUTSIDE THE LINE
MargaretWertheim_2009 HOW CAN I DEFINE PARALLEL LINES I ASK THE QUESTION HOW MANY LINES CAN I DRAW THROUGH THE POINT BUT NEVER MEET THE ORIGINAL LINE AND YOU ALL KNOW THE ANSWER DOES SOMEONE WANT TO SHOUT IT OUT
MargaretWertheim_2009 RIGHT OKAY THAT'S OUR DEFINITION OF A PARALLEL LINE IT'S A DEFINITION REALLY OF EUCLIDEAN SPACE BUT THERE IS ANOTHER POSSIBILITY THAT YOU ALL KNOW OF SPHERICAL SPACE THINK OF THE SURFACE OF A SPHERE JUST LIKE A BEACH BALL THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH
MargaretWertheim_2009 I HAVE A STRAIGHT LINE ON MY SPHERICAL SURFACE AND I HAVE A POINT OUTSIDE THE LINE HOW MANY STRAIGHT LINES CAN I DRAW THROUGH THE POINT BUT NEVER MEET THE ORIGINAL LINE
MargaretWertheim_2009 WHAT DO WE MEAN TO TALK ABOUT A STRAIGHT LINE ON A CURVED SURFACE NOW MATHEMATICIANS HAVE ANSWERED THAT QUESTION THEY'VE UNDERSTOOD THERE IS A GENERALIZED CONCEPT OF STRAIGHTNESS IT'S CALLED A GEODESIC AND ON THE SURFACE OF A SPHERE
MargaretWertheim_2009 A STRAIGHT LINE IS THE BIGGEST POSSIBLE CIRCLE YOU CAN DRAW SO IT'S LIKE THE EQUATOR OR THE LINES OF LONGITUDE SO WE ASK THE QUESTION AGAIN HOW MANY STRAIGHT LINES CAN I DRAW THROUGH THE POINT BUT NEVER MEET THE ORIGINAL LINE
MargaretWertheim_2009 ZERO VERY GOOD NOW MATHEMATICIANS THOUGHT THAT WAS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE IT'S A BIT SUSPICIOUS ISN'T IT THERE IS TWO ANSWERS TO THE QUESTION SO FAR ZERO AND ONE
MargaretWertheim_2009 INFINITY YOU ALL GOT IT RIGHT EXACTLY
MargaretWertheim_2009 THERE IS
MargaretWertheim_2009 THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS A STRAIGHT LINE AND THERE IS AN INFINITE NUMBER OF LINES THAT GO THROUGH THE POINT AND NEVER MEET THE ORIGINAL LINE THIS IS THE DRAWING
MargaretWertheim_2009 THIS NEARLY DROVE MATHEMATICIANS BONKERS BECAUSE LIKE YOU THEY'RE SITTING THERE FEELING BAMBOOZLED THINKING HOW CAN THAT BE YOU'RE CHEATING THE LINES
MargaretWertheim_2009 THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE I'M PROJECTING IT ONTO A FLAT SURFACE MATHEMATICIANS FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS HAD TO REALLY STRUGGLE WITH
MargaretWertheim_2009 HOW COULD THEY SEE THIS WHAT DID IT MEAN TO ACTUALLY HAVE A PHYSICAL MODEL THAT LOOKED LIKE THIS IT'S A BIT LIKE THIS
MargaretWertheim_2009 I CAN SEE IT I CAN FEEL IT I CAN TOUCH IT I CAN PLAY WITH IT AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WHEN DAINA TAIMINA
MargaretWertheim_2009 I'VE STITCHED EUCLID 'S PARALLEL POSTULATE ON TO THE SURFACE AND THE LINES LOOK CURVED BUT LOOK I CAN PROVE TO YOU THAT THEY'RE STRAIGHT BECAUSE I CAN TAKE ANY ONE OF THESE LINES AND I CAN FOLD ALONG IT
MargaretWertheim_2009 IT'S A STRAIGHT LINE
MargaretWertheim_2009 IN WOOL THROUGH A DOMESTIC FEMININE ART IS THE PROOF THAT THE MOST FAMOUS POSTULATE IN MATHEMATICS IS WRONG
MargaretWertheim_2009 YOU CAN STITCH ALL SORTS OF MATHEMATICAL THEOREMS ONTO THESE SURFACES THE DISCOVERY OF HYPERBOLIC SPACE USHERED IN THE FIELD OF MATHEMATICS THAT IS CALLED NON EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY THIS IS ACTUALLY THE FIELD OF MATHEMATICS THAT UNDERLIES GENERAL RELATIVITY
MargaretWertheim_2009 AND IS ACTUALLY ULTIMATELY GOING TO SHOW US ABOUT THE SHAPE OF THE UNIVERSE SO THERE IS THIS DIRECT LINE BETWEEN FEMININE HANDICRAFT EUCLID AND GENERAL RELATIVITY
MargaretWertheim_2009 NOW I SAID THAT MATHEMATICIANS THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE HERE 'S TWO CREATURES WHO 'VE NEVER HEARD OF EUCLID 'S PARALLEL POSTULATE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO VIOLATE AND THEY'RE SIMPLY GETTING ON WITH IT THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS
MargaretWertheim_2009 I ONCE ASKED THE MATHEMATICIANS WHY IT WAS THAT MATHEMATICIANS THOUGHT THIS STRUCTURE WAS IMPOSSIBLE WHEN SEA SLUGS HAVE BEEN DOING
MargaretWertheim_2009 WAS INTERESTING THEY SAID WELL I GUESS THERE AREN'T THAT MANY MATHEMATICIANS SITTING AROUND LOOKING AT SEA SLUGS AND THAT'S TRUE BUT IT ALSO GOES DEEPER THAN THAT
MargaretWertheim_2009 IT ALSO SAYS A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS ABOUT WHAT MATHEMATICIANS THOUGHT MATHEMATICS WAS WHAT THEY THOUGHT IT COULD AND COULDN'T DO WHAT THEY THOUGHT IT COULD AND COULDN'T REPRESENT
MargaretWertheim_2009 EVEN MATHEMATICIANS WHO IN SOME SENSE ARE THE FREEST OF ALL THINKERS LITERALLY COULDN'T SEE NOT ONLY THE SEA SLUGS AROUND THEM
MargaretWertheim_2009 BUT THE LETTUCE ON THEIR PLATE BECAUSE LETTUCES AND ALL THOSE CURLY VEGETABLES THEY ALSO ARE EMBODIMENTS OF HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY
MargaretWertheim_2009 IN SOME SENSE THEY LITERALLY THEY HAD SUCH A SYMBOLIC VIEW OF MATHEMATICS THEY COULDN'T ACTUALLY SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON ON THE LETTUCE IN FRONT OF THEM
MargaretWertheim_2009 IT TURNS OUT THAT THE NATURAL WORLD IS FULL OF HYPERBOLIC WONDERS AND SO TOO WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT THERE IS AN INFINITE TAXONOMY OF CROCHET HYPERBOLIC CREATURES
MargaretWertheim_2009 WE STARTED OUT CHRISSY AND I AND OUR CONTRIBUTORS DOING THE SIMPLE MATHEMATICALLY PERFECT MODELS BUT WE FOUND THAT WHEN WE DEVIATED FROM THE SPECIFIC
MargaretWertheim_2009 SETNESS OF THE MATHEMATICAL CODE THAT UNDERLIES IS THE SIMPLE ALGORITHM CROCHET THREE INCREASE ONE
MargaretWertheim_2009 WHEN WE DEVIATED FROM THAT AND MADE EMBELLISHMENTS TO THE CODE THE MODELS IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO LOOK MORE NATURAL AND ALL OF OUR CONTRIBUTORS WHO ARE AN AMAZING COLLECTION OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD
MargaretWertheim_2009 DO THEIR OWN EMBELLISHMENTS AS IT WERE WE HAVE THIS EVER EVOLVING CROCHET TAXONOMIC TREE OF LIFE
MargaretWertheim_2009 JUST AS THE MORPHOLOGY AND THE COMPLEXITY OF LIFE ON EARTH IS NEVER ENDING LITTLE EMBELLISHMENTS AND COMPLEXIFICATIONS IN THE DNA CODE LEAD TO NEW THINGS LIKE GIRAFFES OR ORCHIDS
MargaretWertheim_2009 SO TOO LITTLE EMBELLISHMENTS IN THE CROCHET CODE LEAD TO NEW AND WONDROUS CREATURES IN THE EVOLUTIONARY TREE OF CROCHET
MargaretWertheim_2009 SO THIS PROJECT REALLY HAS TAKEN ON THIS INNER ORGANIC LIFE OF ITS OWN THERE IS THE TOTALITY OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME TO IT AND THEIR INDIVIDUAL VISIONS AND THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH THIS MATHEMATICAL MODE
MargaretWertheim_2009 HAVE THESE TECHNOLOGIES WE USE THEM BUT WHY WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE WHAT DOES IT MATTER FOR CHRISSY AND I ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT THESE THINGS SUGGEST THE IMPORTANCE AND VALUE
MargaretWertheim_2009 OF EMBODIED KNOWLEDGE WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY THAT COMPLETELY TENDS TO VALORIZE
MargaretWertheim_2009 SORT OF MODALITY CROCHET OTHER
MargaretWertheim_2009 FORMS OF PLAY PEOPLE CAN BE ENGAGED WITH THE MOST ABSTRACT HIGH POWERED THEORETICAL IDEAS THE KINDS OF IDEAS THAT NORMALLY YOU HAVE TO GO
MargaretWertheim_2009 TO UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENTS TO STUDY IN HIGHER MATHEMATICS WHICH IS WHERE I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT HYPERBOLIC SPACE BUT YOU CAN DO IT THROUGH PLAYING WITH MATERIAL OBJECTS
MargaretWertheim_2009 ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE'VE COME TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR FIGURING AND PROJECTS LIKE THIS WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE KINDERGARTEN FOR GROWN UPS
MargaretWertheim_2009 WAS ACTUALLY A VERY FORMALIZED SYSTEM OF EDUCATION ESTABLISHED BY A MAN NAMED FRIEDRICH FROEBEL WHO WAS A CRYSTALLOGRAPHER IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HE BELIEVED THAT THE CRYSTAL WAS THE MODEL FOR ALL KINDS OF REPRESENTATION HE DEVELOPED
MargaretWertheim_2009 THE VALUE OF EDUCATION IS SOMETHING THAT FROEBEL CHAMPIONED THROUGH
MargaretWertheim_2009 WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY NOW WHERE WE HAVE LOTS OF THINK TANKS WHERE GREAT MINDS GO TO THINK ABOUT THE WORLD THEY WRITE THESE GREAT SYMBOLIC TREATISES CALLED BOOKS AND PAPERS AND OP ED ARTICLES
MargaretWertheim_2009 WE WANT TO PROPOSE CHRISSY AND I THROUGH THE INSTITUTE FOR FIGURING ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE WAY OF DOING THINGS WHICH IS THE PLAY TANK
MargaretWertheim_2009 THE PLAY TANK LIKE THE THINK TANK IS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO AND ENGAGE WITH GREAT IDEAS BUT WHAT WE WANT TO PROPOSE IS THAT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF ABSTRACTION THINGS LIKE MATHEMATICS COMPUTING LOGIC ET CETERA ALL OF THIS CAN BE
MargaretWertheim_2009 WITH NOT JUST THROUGH PURELY CEREBRAL ALGEBRAIC SYMBOLIC METHODS BUT BY LITERALLY PHYSICALLY PLAYING WITH IDEAS
