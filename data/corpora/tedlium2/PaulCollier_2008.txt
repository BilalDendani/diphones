PaulCollier_2008@13.10:25.88 SO CAN WE DARE TO BE OPTIMISTIC WELL THE THESIS OF THE BOTTOM BILLION IS THAT A BILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN STUCK LIVING IN ECONOMIES THAT HAVE BEEN STAGNANT FOR FORTY YEARS
PaulCollier_2008@27.11:29.13 AND HENCE DIVERGING FROM THE REST OF
PaulCollier_2008@31.22:38.27 AND SO THE REAL QUESTION TO POSE IS NOT CAN WE BE OPTIMISTIC IT 'S HOW CAN WE GIVE CREDIBLE HOPE TO THAT BILLION PEOPLE
PaulCollier_2008@39.24:43.03 THAT TO MY MIND IS THE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE NOW OF DEVELOPMENT
PaulCollier_2008@45.17:46.59 WHAT I'M GOING TO OFFER YOU
PaulCollier_2008@64.44:68.68 LIVING IN SOCIETIES THAT HAVE NOT OFFERED CREDIBLE HOPE
PaulCollier_2008@70.88:72.46 THAT IS A HUMAN TRAGEDY
PaulCollier_2008@73.74:75.47 ENLIGHTENED SELF INTEREST
PaulCollier_2008@76.26:81.07 BECAUSE IF THAT ECONOMIC DIVERGENCE CONTINUES FOR ANOTHER FORTY YEARS
PaulCollier_2008@83.82:86.34 COMBINED WITH SOCIAL INTEGRATION GLOBALLY
PaulCollier_2008@87.14:88.71 IT WILL BUILD A NIGHTMARE FOR
PaulCollier_2008@91.43:94.70 WE NEED COMPASSION TO GET OURSELVES STARTED
PaulCollier_2008@95.62:99.69 AND ENLIGHTENED SELF INTEREST TO GET OURSELVES SERIOUS
PaulCollier_2008@101.11:102.94 THAT'S THE ALLIANCE THAT CHANGES THE WORLD
PaulCollier_2008@104.05:110.19 SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT PROVIDING HOPE FOR THE BOTTOM BILLION
PaulCollier_2008@111.32:112.99 WHAT CAN WE ACTUALLY DO
PaulCollier_2008@118.71:130.10 WHAT DID WE DO LAST TIME THE RICH WORLD GOT SERIOUS ABOUT DEVELOPING ANOTHER REGION OF THE WORLD THAT GIVES US IT TURNS OUT QUITE A GOOD CLUE
PaulCollier_2008@134.54:140.79 THE LAST TIME THE RICH WORLD GOT SERIOUS ABOUT DEVELOPING ANOTHER REGION WAS IN THE LATE NINETEEN FORTIES
PaulCollier_2008@142.76:145.96 THE RICH WORLD WAS YOU AMERICA
PaulCollier_2008@146.88:151.63 AND THE REGION THAT NEEDED TO BE DEVELOPED WAS MY WORLD EUROPE
PaulCollier_2008@155.49:157.45 WHY DID AMERICA GET SERIOUS
PaulCollier_2008@158.49:161.85 IT WASN'T JUST COMPASSION FOR EUROPE THOUGH THERE WAS THAT
PaulCollier_2008@163.01:164.57 IT WAS THAT YOU KNEW YOU HAD TO
PaulCollier_2008@165.71:172.86 BECAUSE IN THE LATE NINETEEN FORTIES COUNTRY AFTER COUNTRY IN CENTRAL EUROPE WAS FALLING INTO THE SOVIET BLOC
PaulCollier_2008@173.82:175.60 AND SO YOU KNEW YOU'D NO CHOICE
PaulCollier_2008@176.32:182.49 EUROPE HAD TO BE DRAGGED INTO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SO WHAT DID YOU DO LAST TIME YOU GOT SERIOUS
PaulCollier_2008@183.32:190.01 WELL YES YOU HAD A BIG AID PROGRAM THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WAS MARSHALL AID WE NEED TO DO IT AGAIN
PaulCollier_2008@190.59:193.24 AID IS PART OF THE SOLUTION BUT WHAT ELSE
PaulCollier_2008@202.24:207.35 BEFORE THE WAR AMERICA HAD BEEN HIGHLY PROTECTIONIST AFTER THE WAR
PaulCollier_2008@208.59:218.85 YOU OPENED YOUR MARKETS TO EUROPE YOU DRAGGED EUROPE INTO THE THEN GLOBAL ECONOMY WHICH WAS YOUR ECONOMY AND YOU INSTITUTIONALIZED THAT TRADE LIBERALIZATION THROUGH FOUNDING THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS
PaulCollier_2008@220.55:231.59 SO TOTAL REVERSAL OF TRADE POLICY DID YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE YES YOU TOTALLY REVERSED YOUR SECURITY POLICY BEFORE THE WAR YOUR SECURITY POLICY HAD BEEN ISOLATIONIST
PaulCollier_2008@232.31:238.43 AFTER THE WAR YOU TEAR THAT UP YOU PUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TROOPS IN EUROPE FOR OVER FORTY YEARS
PaulCollier_2008@241.15:247.47 TOTAL REVERSAL OF SECURITY POLICY ANYTHING ELSE YES YOU TEAR UP THE ELEVENTH COMMANDMENT
PaulCollier_2008@253.01:259.11 YOU TREATED NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AS SO SACROSANCT THAT YOU WEREN'T EVEN WILLING TO JOIN THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS
PaulCollier_2008@259.92:268.49 AFTER THE WAR YOU FOUND THE UNITED NATIONS YOU FOUND THE ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT YOU FOUND THE IMF YOU ENCOURAGED EUROPE
PaulCollier_2008@269.54:273.67 TO CREATE THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY ALL SYSTEMS FOR MUTUAL GOVERNMENT SUPPORT
PaulCollier_2008@276.19:284.89 THAT IS STILL THE WATERFRONT OF EFFECTIVE POLICIES AID TRADE SECURITY GOVERNMENTS
PaulCollier_2008@286.20:291.88 THE DETAILS OF POLICY ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE IS DIFFERENT IT'S NOT REBUILDING EUROPE
PaulCollier_2008@294.08:302.12 IT'S REVERSING THE DIVERGENCE FOR THE BOTTOM BILLION SO THAT THEY ACTUALLY CATCH UP IS THAT EASIER OR HARDER
PaulCollier_2008@303.24:306.11 WE NEED TO BE AT LEAST AS SERIOUS AS WE
PaulCollier_2008@309.12:319.51 NOW TODAY I'M GOING TO TAKE JUST ONE OF THOSE FOUR I'M GOING TO TAKE THE ONE THAT SOUNDS THE WEAKEST THE ONE THAT'S JUST MOTHERHOOD AND APPLE PIE
PaulCollier_2008@328.25:330.72 WE COULD DO SOMETHING TO STRENGTHEN GOVERNANCE
PaulCollier_2008@331.70:335.70 AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THAT THAT IS ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT NOW
PaulCollier_2008@338.71:340.29 THE OPPORTUNITY
PaulCollier_2008@345.26:348.90 IS A GENUINE BASIS FOR OPTIMISM ABOUT THE BOTTOM BILLION
PaulCollier_2008@349.85:351.87 AND THAT IS THE COMMODITY BOOMS
PaulCollier_2008@352.64:354.12 THE COMMODITY BOOMS
PaulCollier_2008@355.92:362.85 PUMPING UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNTS OF MONEY INTO MANY THOUGH NOT ALL OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE BOTTOM BILLION
PaulCollier_2008@369.00:373.97 IT'S NOT JUST THAT THERE'S ALSO A RANGE OF NEW DISCOVERIES
PaulCollier_2008@383.57:390.62 GUINEA HAS GOT A HUGE NEW EXPLOITATION OF IRON ORE COMING OUT OF THE GROUND SO A MASS OF NEW DISCOVERIES
PaulCollier_2008@391.60:392.34 BETWEEN THEM
PaulCollier_2008@393.21:400.60 THESE NEW REVENUE FLOWS DWARF AID JUST TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE ANGOLA ALONE
PaulCollier_2008@400.88:410.21 IS GETTING FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN OIL REVENUE THE ENTIRE AID FLOWS TO THE SIXTY COUNTRIES OF THE BOTTOM BILLION LAST YEAR WERE THIRTY FOUR
PaulCollier_2008@412.98:416.77 THE FLOW OF RESOURCES FROM THE COMMODITY BOOMS TO THE BOTTOM BILLION
PaulCollier_2008@420.14:421.27 SO THERE'S THE OPTIMISM
PaulCollier_2008@432.33:438.52 SO HERE COMES A BIT OF SCIENCE AND THIS IS A BIT OF SCIENCE I'VE DONE SINCE THE BOTTOM BILLION SO IT'S NEW
PaulCollier_2008@439.78:448.50 I'VE LOOKED TO SEE WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIGHER COMMODITY PRICES OF EXPORTS AND THE GROWTH OF COMMODITY EXPORTING COUNTRIES
PaulCollier_2008@448.80:455.57 AND I'VE LOOKED GLOBALLY I'VE TAKEN ALL THE COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS AND LOOKED TO SEE WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP
PaulCollier_2008@457.17:458.21 AND THE
PaulCollier_2008@460.36:464.20 THE FIRST FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS IS JUST GREAT
PaulCollier_2008@465.23:468.14 IN FACT IT'S HUNKY DORY EVERYTHING GOES UP
PaulCollier_2008@470.02:477.73 GET MORE MONEY BECAUSE YOUR TERMS OF TRADE HAVE IMPROVED BUT ALSO THAT DRIVES UP OUTPUT ACROSS THE BOARD SO GDP GOES UP A LOT
PaulCollier_2008@481.71:482.47 AND HOW ABOUT THE LONG
PaulCollier_2008@483.59:485.07 COME BACK FIFTEEN YEARS LATER
PaulCollier_2008@486.27:490.45 WELL THE SHORT RUN IT'S HUNKY DORY BUT THE LONG RUN
PaulCollier_2008@491.08:492.25 IT'S HUMPTY DUMPTY
PaulCollier_2008@493.74:505.76 YOU GO UP IN THE SHORT RUN BUT THEN MOST SOCIETIES HISTORICALLY HAVE ENDED UP WORSE THAN IF THEY'D HAD NO BOOMS AT ALL THAT IS NOT A FORECAST ABOUT HOW COMMODITY PRICES
PaulCollier_2008@506.66:513.77 IT'S A FORECAST OF THE CONSEQUENCES THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES FOR GROWTH OF AN INCREASE IN PRICES
PaulCollier_2008@515.50:518.23 SO WHAT GOES WRONG WHY IS THERE THIS RESOURCE
PaulCollier_2008@520.79:526.72 AND AGAIN I'VE LOOKED AT THAT AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE CRITICAL ISSUE IS THE LEVEL OF
PaulCollier_2008@527.84:531.50 THE INITIAL LEVEL OF ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE WHEN THE RESOURCE BOOMS ACCRUE
PaulCollier_2008@532.73:537.90 IN FACT IF YOU'VE GOT GOOD ENOUGH GOVERNANCE THERE IS NO RESOURCE BOOM YOU GO UP IN THE SHORT TERM
PaulCollier_2008@562.09:563.90 THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE SHORT RUN WILL PERSIST
PaulCollier_2008@580.02:591.69 THERE'S A THRESHOLD LEVEL ABOVE WHICH YOU GO UP IN THE LONG TERM AND BELOW WHICH YOU GO DOWN JUST TO BENCHMARK THAT THRESHOLD IT'S ABOUT THE GOVERNANCE LEVEL OF PORTUGAL IN THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES
PaulCollier_2008@594.66:596.47 SO THE QUESTION IS ARE THE BOTTOM BILLION ABOVE
PaulCollier_2008@599.19:600.75 NOW THERE'S ONE BIG CHANGE
PaulCollier_2008@602.11:606.77 SINCE THE COMMODITY BOOMS OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND THAT IS THE SPREAD OF DEMOCRACY
PaulCollier_2008@626.78:629.30 OF THESE RESOURCE BOOMS THAN AUTOCRACIES
PaulCollier_2008@629.68:632.30 AT THAT STAGE I JUST WANTED TO ABANDON THE RESEARCH
PaulCollier_2008@634.96:641.30 IT TURNS OUT THAT DEMOCRACY IS A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT ASPECTS OF DEMOCRACY
PaulCollier_2008@652.28:658.41 IT TURNS OUT THAT ELECTORAL COMPETITION IS THE THING THAT'S DOING THE DAMAGE WITH DEMOCRACY WHEREAS STRONG CHECKS AND BALANCES
PaulCollier_2008@659.97:666.39 MAKE RESOURCE BOOMS GOOD AND SO WHAT THE COUNTRIES OF THE BOTTOM BILLION NEED IS VERY STRONG CHECKS AND BALANCES
PaulCollier_2008@667.25:676.85 THEY HAVEN'T GOT THEM THEY GOT INSTANT DEMOCRACY IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES ELECTIONS WITHOUT CHECKS AND BALANCES HOW CAN WE HELP
PaulCollier_2008@687.47:696.55 THE SIMPLE PROPOSAL IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE SOME INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS WHICH WILL BE VOLUNTARY BUT WHICH WOULD SPELL OUT THE KEY DECISION POINTS
PaulCollier_2008@698.23:702.49 NEED TO BE TAKEN IN ORDER TO HARNESS THESE RESOURCE REVENUES
PaulCollier_2008@703.59:709.94 WE KNOW THESE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS WORK BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY GOT ONE IT'S CALLED THE EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE
PaulCollier_2008@711.40:717.49 THAT IS THE VERY SIMPLE IDEA THAT GOVERNMENTS SHOULD REPORT TO THEIR CITIZENS WHAT REVENUES THEY HAVE
PaulCollier_2008@718.90:723.35 WAS IT PROPOSED THAN REFORMERS IN NIGERIA ADOPTED IT
PaulCollier_2008@735.01:741.28 SO WE KNOW IT WORKS WHAT WOULD THE CONTENT BE OF THESE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS
PaulCollier_2008@743.29:746.30 THROUGH ALL OF THEM BUT I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
PaulCollier_2008@747.41:748.66 THE FIRST IS
PaulCollier_2008@749.08:755.65 HOW TO TAKE THE RESOURCES OUT OF THE GROUND THE ECONOMIC PROCESSES TAKING THE RESOURCES OUT OF THE GROUND AND PUTTING ASSETS ON TOP OF THE
PaulCollier_2008@757.09:760.74 AND THE FIRST STEP IN THAT IS SELLING THE RIGHTS TO RESOURCE EXTRACTION
PaulCollier_2008@761.94:767.23 YOU KNOW HOW RIGHTS TO RESOURCE EXTRACTION ARE BEING SOLD AT THE MOMENT HOW THEY'VE BEEN SOLD OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS
PaulCollier_2008@767.83:775.22 A COMPANY FLIES IN DOES A DEAL WITH A MINISTER AND THAT'S GREAT FOR THE COMPANY AND IT'S QUITE OFTEN GREAT FOR THE MINISTER
PaulCollier_2008@783.40:786.09 AND IT'S CALLED VERIFIED AUCTIONS
PaulCollier_2008@791.50:803.63 THE PUBLIC AGENCY WITH THE GREATEST EXPERTISE ON EARTH IS OF COURSE THE TREASURY THAT IS THE BRITISH TREASURY AND THE BRITISH TREASURY DECIDED THAT IT WOULD SELL THE RIGHTS TO THIRD GENERATION MOBILE PHONES BY WORKING OUT WHAT THOSE RIGHTS
PaulCollier_2008@805.38:813.95 WORKED OUT THEY WERE WORTH TWO BILLION POUNDS JUST IN TIME A SET OF ECONOMISTS GOT THERE AND SAID WHY NOT TRY AN AUCTION IT'LL REVEAL THE
PaulCollier_2008@815.02:824.22 IT WENT FOR TWENTY BILLION POUNDS THROUGH AUCTION IF THE BRITISH TREASURY CAN BE OUT BY A FACTOR OF TEN THINK WHAT THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE IN SIERRA LEONE IS
PaulCollier_2008@826.16:833.15 PUT THAT TO THE PRESIDENT OF SIERRA LEONE THE NEXT DAY HE ASKED THE WORLD BANK TO SEND HIM A TEAM TO GIVE EXPERTISE ON HOW TO CONDUCT
PaulCollier_2008@835.22:842.71 THERE ARE FIVE SUCH DECISION POINTS EACH ONE NEEDS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD IF WE COULD DO IT
PaulCollier_2008@844.80:846.64 CHANGE THE WORLD WE WOULD BE HELPING
PaulCollier_2008@847.14:853.81 THE REFORMERS IN THESE SOCIETIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING FOR CHANGE THAT'S OUR MODEST
PaulCollier_2008@854.61:862.36 WE CANNOT CHANGE THESE SOCIETIES BUT WE CAN HELP THE PEOPLE IN THESE SOCIETIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING AND USUALLY FAILING
PaulCollier_2008@868.76:870.84 AND YET WE'VE NOT GOT THESE RULES
PaulCollier_2008@871.21:875.81 IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE COST OF PROMULGATING INTERNATIONAL RULES IS ZILCH
PaulCollier_2008@878.50:880.18 WHY ON EARTH ARE THEY NOT
PaulCollier_2008@882.77:884.95 I REALIZED THAT THE REASON THEY'RE NOT
PaulCollier_2008@894.09:895.92 WILL GET AWAY WITH GESTURES
PaulCollier_2008@897.80:905.34 THAT UNLESS WE HAVE AN INFORMED SOCIETY WHAT POLITICIANS DO ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO AFRICA IS GESTURES
PaulCollier_2008@906.43:908.34 THINGS THAT LOOK GOOD BUT DON'T
PaulCollier_2008@909.88:910.89 AND SO I REALIZED
PaulCollier_2008@911.54:924.66 WE HAD TO GO THROUGH THE BUSINESS OF BUILDING AN INFORMED CITIZENRY THAT'S WHY I BROKE ALL THE PROFESSIONAL RULES OF CONDUCT FOR AN ECONOMIST AND I WROTE AN ECONOMICS BOOK THAT YOU COULD READ ON A BEACH
PaulCollier_2008@929.36:937.35 HOWEVER I HAVE TO SAY THE PROCESS OF COMMUNICATION DOES NOT COME NATURALLY TO ME THIS IS WHY I'M ON THIS STAGE BUT IT'S
PaulCollier_2008@939.29:943.05 I GREW UP IN A CULTURE OF SELF
PaulCollier_2008@947.18:957.12 MY WIFE SHOWED ME A BLOG COMMENT ON ONE OF MY LAST TALKS AND THE BLOG COMMENT SAID COLLIER IS NOT CHARISMATIC
PaulCollier_2008@961.29:962.17 BUT HIS ARGUMENTS
PaulCollier_2008@975.34:977.44 YOU AGREE WITH THAT SENTIMENT
PaulCollier_2008@977.98:986.24 AND IF YOU AGREE THAT WE NEED A CRITICAL MASS OF INFORMED CITIZENRY YOU WILL REALIZE THAT I NEED YOU
PaulCollier_2008@987.39:990.83 PLEASE BECOME AMBASSADORS THANK YOU
