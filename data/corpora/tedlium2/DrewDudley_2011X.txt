DrewDudley_2011X SEE I 'VE ASKED THAT QUESTION ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND EVERYWHERE I ASK IT NO MATTER WHERE THERE 'S ALWAYS A HUGE PORTION OF THE AUDIENCE THAT WON 'T PUT UP THEIR HAND
DrewDudley_2011X AND I 'VE COME TO REALIZE THAT WE HAVE MADE LEADERSHIP INTO SOMETHING BIGGER THAN US WE 'VE MADE INTO SOMETHING BEYOND US WE 'VE MADE IT ABOUT CHANGING THE WORLD
DrewDudley_2011X AND WE 'VE TAKEN THIS TITLE OF LEADER AND WE TREAT IT AS IF IT 'S SOMETHING THAT ONE DAY WE 'RE GOING TO DESERVE BUT TO GIVE IT TO OURSELVES RIGHT NOW MEANS A LEVEL OF ARROGANCE OR COCKINESS THAT WE 'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH AND I WORRY SOMETIMES THAT WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME CELEBRATING AMAZING THINGS THAT HARDLY ANYBODY CAN DO
DrewDudley_2011X THAT WE 'VE CONVINCED OURSELVES THAT THOSE ARE THE ONLY THINGS WORTH CELEBRATING AND WE START TO DEVALUE THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO EVERY DAY AND WE START TO TAKE MOMENTS WHERE WE TRULY ARE A LEADER AND WE DON 'T LET OURSELVES TAKE CREDIT FOR IT AND WE DON 'T LET OURSELVES FEEL GOOD ABOUT
DrewDudley_2011X AND ON MY LAST DAY THERE A GIRL CAME UP TO ME AND SHE SAID I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME THAT I MET YOU AND THEN SHE TOLD ME A STORY THAT HAD HAPPENED FOUR YEARS EARLIER SHE SAID
DrewDudley_2011X ON THE DAY BEFORE I STARTED UNIVERSITY I WAS IN THE HOTEL ROOM WITH MY MOM AND MY DAD AND I WAS SO SCARED AND SO CONVINCED THAT I COULDN 'T DO THIS THAT I WASN 'T READY FOR UNIVERSITY THAT I JUST BURST INTO TEARS AND MY MOM AND MY DAD WERE AMAZING THEY WERE LIKE LOOK WE KNOW YOU 'RE SCARED
DrewDudley_2011X BUT LET 'S JUST GO TOMORROW LET 'S GO TO THE FIRST DAY AND IF AT ANY POINT YOU FEEL AS IF YOU CAN 'T DO THIS THAT 'S FINE JUST TELL US WE WILL TAKE YOU HOME WE LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT
DrewDudley_2011X AND SHE SAYS SO I WENT THE NEXT DAY AND I WAS STANDING IN LINE GETTING READY FOR REGISTRATION AND I LOOKED AROUND AND I JUST KNEW I COULDN 'T DO IT I KNEW I WASN 'T READY I KNEW I HAD TO QUIT AND SHE SAYS I MADE THAT DECISION AND AS SOON AS I MADE IT THERE WAS THIS INCREDIBLE FEELING OF PEACE THAT CAME OVER ME
DrewDudley_2011X AND I TURNED TO MY MOM AND MY DAD TO TELL THEM THAT WE NEEDED TO GO HOME AND JUST AT THAT MOMENT YOU CAME OUT OF THE STUDENT UNION BUILDING WEARING THE STUPIDEST HAT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE
DrewDudley_2011X YOU GOT TO ME AND YOU JUST STOPPED
DrewDudley_2011X AND YOU STARED IT WAS CREEPY
DrewDudley_2011X AND THEN YOU LOOKED AT THE GUY NEXT TO ME AND YOU SMILED AND YOU REACHED IN YOUR BUCKET AND YOU PULLED OUT A LOLLIPOP AND YOU HELD IT OUT TO HIM AND YOU SAID YOU NEED TO GIVE A LOLLIPOP TO THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN STANDING NEXT TO YOU AND SHE SAID I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYONE GET MORE EMBARRASSED FASTER IN MY LIFE HE TURNED BEET RED AND HE WOULDN 'T EVEN LOOK AT ME HE JUST KIND OF HELD THE LOLLIPOP OUT LIKE THIS
DrewDudley_2011X AND I KNOW THIS IS CHEESY AND I DON 'T KNOW WHY I 'M TELLING YOU THIS BUT IN THAT MOMENT WHEN EVERYONE WAS LAUGHING I KNEW THAT I SHOULDN 'T QUIT
DrewDudley_2011X I KNEW THAT I WAS WHERE I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AND I KNEW THAT I WAS HOME
DrewDudley_2011X AND I HAVEN 'T SPOKEN TO YOU ONCE IN THE FOUR YEARS SINCE THAT DAY BUT I HEARD THAT YOU WERE LEAVING AND I HAD TO COME UP AND TELL YOU THAT YOU 'VE BEEN AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PERSON IN MY LIFE AND I 'M GOING TO MISS YOU
DrewDudley_2011X AND SHE GETS ABOUT SIX FEET AWAY SHE TURNS AROUND AND SMILES AND GOES YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW THIS TOO I 'M STILL DATING THAT GUY FOUR YEARS LATER
DrewDudley_2011X I MOVED TO TORONTO I GOT AN INVITATION TO THEIR WEDDING
DrewDudley_2011X HERE 'S THE KICKER I DON 'T REMEMBER THAT
DrewDudley_2011X I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF THAT MOMENT AND I 'VE SEARCHED MY MEMORY BANKS BECAUSE THAT IS FUNNY AND I SHOULD REMEMBER DOING IT AND I DON 'T REMEMBER IT AND
DrewDudley_2011X THAT WAS SUCH AN EYE OPENING TRANSFORMATIVE MOMENT FOR ME TO THINK THAT MAYBE THE BIGGEST IMPACT I 'D EVER HAD ON ANYONE 'S LIFE A MOMENT THAT HAD A WOMAN WALK UP TO A STRANGER FOUR YEARS LATER AND SAY YOU 'VE BEEN AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PERSON IN MY LIFE WAS A MOMENT THAT I DIDN 'T EVEN REMEMBER
DrewDudley_2011X HOW MANY OF YOU GUYS HAVE A LOLLIPOP MOMENT A MOMENT WHERE SOMEONE SAID SOMETHING OR DID SOMETHING THAT YOU FEEL FUNDAMENTALLY MADE YOUR LIFE BETTER
DrewDudley_2011X ALL RIGHT HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE TOLD THAT PERSON THEY DID IT
DrewDudley_2011X SEE WHY NOT WE CELEBRATE BIRTHDAYS WHERE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS NOT DIE FOR THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS
DrewDudley_2011X BUT IT IS SO SCARY TO THINK OF OURSELVES AS THAT POWERFUL IT CAN BE FRIGHTENING TO THINK THAT WE CAN MATTER THAT MUCH TO OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE AS LONG AS WE MAKE LEADERSHIP SOMETHING BIGGER THAN US AS LONG AS WE KEEP LEADERSHIP SOMETHING BEYOND US AS LONG AS WE MAKE IT ABOUT CHANGING THE WORLD WE GIVE OURSELVES AN EXCUSE NOT TO EXPECT IT EVERY DAY FROM OURSELVES AND FROM EACH OTHER
DrewDudley_2011X MARIANNE WILLIAMSON SAID OUR GREATEST FEAR IS NOT THAT WE ARE INADEQUATE OUR GREATEST FEAR IS THAT WE ARE POWERFUL BEYOND MEASURE IT IS OUR LIGHT AND NOT OUR DARKNESS THAT FRIGHTENS US
DrewDudley_2011X AND MY CALL TO ACTION TODAY IS THAT WE NEED TO GET OVER THAT WE NEED TO GET OVER OUR FEAR OF HOW EXTRAORDINARILY POWERFUL WE CAN BE IN EACH OTHER 'S LIVES WE NEED TO GET OVER IT SO WE CAN MOVE BEYOND IT AND OUR LITTLE BROTHERS AND OUR LITTLE SISTERS AND ONE DAY OUR KIDS
DrewDudley_2011X OR OUR KIDS RIGHT NOW CAN WATCH AND START TO VALUE THE IMPACT WE CAN HAVE ON EACH OTHER 'S LIVES MORE THAN MONEY AND POWER AND TITLES AND INFLUENCE WE NEED TO REDEFINE LEADERSHIP AS BEING ABOUT LOLLIPOP MOMENTS HOW MANY OF THEM WE CREATE HOW MANY OF THEM WE ACKNOWLEDGE HOW MANY OF THEM WE PAY FORWARD AND HOW MANY OF THEM WE SAY THANK YOU FOR
DrewDudley_2011X BECAUSE WE 'VE MADE LEADERSHIP ABOUT CHANGING THE WORLD AND THERE IS NO WORLD THERE 'S ONLY SIX BILLION UNDERSTANDINGS OF IT AND IF YOU CHANGE ONE PERSON 'S UNDERSTANDING OF IT ONE PERSON 'S UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEY 'RE CAPABLE OF ONE PERSON 'S UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MUCH PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THEM ONE PERSON 'S UNDERSTANDING OF HOW POWERFUL AN AGENT FOR CHANGE THEY CAN BE IN THIS WORLD YOU 'VE CHANGED THE WHOLE THING
DrewDudley_2011X AND IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND LEADERSHIP LIKE THAT I THINK IF WE CAN REDEFINE LEADERSHIP LIKE THAT
