ArthurBenjamin_2009@20.49:24.92 I WOULD HAVE A SUGGESTION FOR HIM THAT I THINK WOULD VASTLY IMPROVE THE
ArthurBenjamin_2009@36.60:44.28 AND ALGEBRA AND EVERYTHING WE LEARN AFTER THAT IS BUILDING UP TOWARDS ONE SUBJECT AND AT TOP OF THAT PYRAMID
ArthurBenjamin_2009@44.71:51.72 IT'S CALCULUS AND I'M HERE TO SAY THAT I THINK THAT THAT IS THE WRONG SUMMIT OF THE PYRAMID
ArthurBenjamin_2009@52.17:61.46 THE CORRECT SUMMIT THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS EVERY HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE SHOULD KNOW SHOULD BE STATISTICS PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS
ArthurBenjamin_2009@64.28:73.05 DON'T GET ME WRONG CALCULUS IS AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT PRODUCTS OF THE HUMAN MIND THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF CALCULUS
ArthurBenjamin_2009@73.38:81.11 AND EVERY STUDENT WHO STUDIES MATH SCIENCE ENGINEERING ECONOMICS THEY SHOULD DEFINITELY LEARN CALCULUS BY THE END OF THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR OF COLLEGE
ArthurBenjamin_2009@81.43:88.56 BUT I'M HERE TO SAY AS A PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE CALCULUS IN A
ArthurBenjamin_2009@96.44:103.71 AND SHOULD USE ON DAILY BASIS RIGHT IT'S RISK IT'S REWARD IT'S RANDOMNESS IT'S UNDERSTANDING DATA
ArthurBenjamin_2009@117.28:117.83 IF IT'S
ArthurBenjamin_2009@119.11:130.00 IT CAN BE A LOT OF FUN I MEAN PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS IT'S THE MATHEMATICS OF GAMES AND GAMBLING IT'S ANALYZING TRENDS IT'S PREDICTING THE FUTURE
ArthurBenjamin_2009@130.60:143.85 LOOK THE WORLD HAS CHANGED FROM ANALOG TO DIGITAL AND IT'S TIME FOR OUR MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM TO CHANGE FROM ANALOG TO DIGITAL FROM THE MORE CLASSICAL CONTINUOUS
ArthurBenjamin_2009@144.68:154.35 TO THE MORE MODERN DISCRETE MATHEMATICS THE MATHEMATICS OF UNCERTAINTY OF RANDOMNESS OF DATA AND THAT BEING PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS
ArthurBenjamin_2009@154.65:169.19 IN SUMMARY INSTEAD OF OUR STUDENTS LEARNING ABOUT THE TECHNIQUES OF CALCULUS I THINK IT WOULD BE FAR MORE SIGNIFICANT IF ALL OF THEM KNEW WHAT TWO STANDARD DEVIATIONS FROM THE MEAN MEANS AND I MEAN IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
