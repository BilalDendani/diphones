MarkForsyth_2012X@21.2:36.38 JUST BECAUSE IT SOUNDS SO GOOD AND WHAT SNOLLYGOSTER MEANS IS A DISHONEST POLITICIAN ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A NINETEENTH CENTURY NEWSPAPER EDITOR WHO DEFINED IT RATHER BETTER WHEN HE SAID A SNOLLYGOSTER IS A FELLOW WHO SEEKS OFFICE REGARDLESS OF PARTY
MarkForsyth_2012X@45.53:56.72 NOW I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TALKNOPHICAL IS SOMETHING TO DO WITH WORDS I ASSUME BUT IT 'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WORDS ARE AT THE CENTER OF POLITICS AND ALL POLITICIANS KNOW THEY HAVE TO TRY AND CONTROL LANGUAGE
MarkForsyth_2012X@56.72:67.54 IT WASN 'T UNTIL FOR EXAMPLE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE THAT THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT ALLOWED NEWSPAPERS TO REPORT THE EXACT WORDS THAT WERE SAID IN THE DEBATING CHAMBER
MarkForsyth_2012X@79.15:81.34 BUT HE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH
MarkForsyth_2012X@94.11:100.09 MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT 'S DOWN TO THE METAL IT 'S NOT IT 'S DOWN TO A CAMPAIGNER FOR THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS
MarkForsyth_2012X@100.5:110.21 BUT TO REALLY SHOW YOU HOW WORDS AND POLITICS INTERACT I WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA JUST AFTER THEY 'D ACHIEVED INDEPENDENCE
MarkForsyth_2012X@110.21:119.27 AND THEY HAD TO FACE THE QUESTION OF WHAT TO CALL GEORGE WASHINGTON THEIR LEADER THEY DIDN 'T KNOW WHAT DO YOU CALL THE LEADER OF A REPUBLICAN COUNTRY
MarkForsyth_2012X@119.27:138.78 AND THIS WAS DEBATED IN CONGRESS FOR AGES AND AGES AND THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF SUGGESTIONS ON THE TABLE WHICH MIGHT HAVE MADE IT I MEAN SOME PEOPLE WANTED HIM TO BE CALLED CHIEF MAGISTRATE WASHINGTON AND OTHER PEOPLE HIS HIGHNESS GEORGE WASHINGTON AND OTHER PEOPLE PROTECTOR OF THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
MarkForsyth_2012X@139.05:150.38 WASHINGTON NOT THAT CATCHY SOME PEOPLE JUST WANTED TO CALL HIM KING THEY THOUGHT IT WAS TRIED AND TESTED AND THEY WEREN 'T EVEN BEING MONARCHICAL THERE THEY HAD THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD BE ELECTED KING FOR A FIXED TERM
MarkForsyth_2012X@150.38:161.38 AND YOU KNOW IT COULD HAVE WORKED AND EVERYBODY GOT INSANELY BORED ACTUALLY BECAUSE THIS DEBATE WENT ON FOR THREE WEEKS I READ A DIARY OF THIS POOR SENATOR WHO JUST KEEPS COMING BACK STILL ON THIS SUBJECT
MarkForsyth_2012X@161.58:167.13 THE REASON FOR THE DELAY AND THE BOREDOM WAS THAT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WERE AGAINST THE SENATE
MarkForsyth_2012X@181.86:183.72 AND THAT TITLE
MarkForsyth_2012X@184.44:188.18 WAS PRESIDENT
MarkForsyth_2012X@206.07:221.87 AND THAT 'S WHY THE SENATE OBJECTED TO IT THEY SAID THAT 'S RIDICULOUS YOU CAN 'T CALL HIM PRESIDENT THIS GUY HAS TO GO AND SIGN TREATIES AND MEET FOREIGN DIGNITARIES AND WHO 'S GOING TO TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY IF HE 'S GOT A SILLY LITTLE TITLE LIKE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
MarkForsyth_2012X@222.38:225.31 AND AFTER THREE WEEKS OF DEBATE IN THE END
MarkForsyth_2012X@225.31:227.39 THE SENATE
MarkForsyth_2012X@227.91:235.17 DID NOT CAVE IN INSTEAD THEY AGREED TO USE THE TITLE PRESIDENT FOR NOW
MarkForsyth_2012X@235.45:242.02 BUT THEY ALSO WANTED IT ABSOLUTELY SET DOWN THAT THEY DIDN 'T AGREE WITH IT
MarkForsyth_2012X@258.27:263.44 NOT BLOODY PRESIDENT AND THAT IN THE INTERCOURSE WITH FOREIGN NATIONS
MarkForsyth_2012X@295.51:299.58 SECOND THING YOU CAN LEARN IS THAT WHEN A GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT THIS IS A TEMPORARY MEASURE
MarkForsyth_2012X@307.45:319.33 BUT THE THIRD THING YOU CAN LEARN AND THIS IS THE REALLY IMPORTANT ONE THIS IS THE POINT I WANT TO LEAVE YOU ON IS THAT THE TITLE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA DOESN 'T SOUND THAT HUMBLE AT ALL
MarkForsyth_2012X@331.34:333.75 REALITY
MarkForsyth_2012X@339.57:343.75 AND SO THE SENATE WON IN THE END THEY GOT THEIR TITLE OF RESPECTABILITY
MarkForsyth_2012X@343.75:348.78 AND ALSO THE SENATE 'S OTHER WORRY THE APPEARANCE OF SINGULARITY WELL IT WAS A SINGULARITY BACK
MarkForsyth_2012X@352.22:354.08 A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN
MarkForsyth_2012X@354.5:359.26 ALL BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SOUND LIKE THE GUY WHO 'S GOT THE FIVE THOUSAND NUCLEAR WARHEADS ETC
MarkForsyth_2012X@359.26:363.85 AND SO IN THE END THE SENATE WON
MarkForsyth_2012X@364.06:366.98 AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES LOST
MarkForsyth_2012X@367.59:374.98 BECAUSE NOBODY 'S GOING TO FEEL THAT HUMBLE WHEN THEY 'RE TOLD THAT THEY ARE NOW THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
MarkForsyth_2012X@375.19:385.83 AND THAT 'S THE IMPORTANT LESSON I THINK YOU CAN TAKE AWAY AND THE ONE I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH POLITICIANS TRY TO PICK WORDS AND USE WORDS TO SHAPE REALITY AND CONTROL REALITY BUT IN FACT
MarkForsyth_2012X@386.44:388.62 REALITY CHANGES WORDS
