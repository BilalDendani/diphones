GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@25.51:30.32 MOST PEOPLE IMAGINE ORPHANAGES AS A BENIGN ENVIRONMENT THAT CARE FOR CHILDREN
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@36.44:41.42 AFTER ALL WHERE ELSE WOULD WE PUT ALL OF THOSE CHILDREN WHO DON 'T HAVE ANY PARENTS
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@41.61:55.56 BUT SIXTY YEARS OF RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND PLACING THEM IN LARGE INSTITUTIONS SERIOUSLY HARMS THEIR HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR YOUNG BABIES
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@55.93:62.86 AS WE KNOW BABIES ARE BORN WITHOUT THEIR FULL MUSCLE DEVELOPMENT AND THAT INCLUDES THE BRAIN
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@63.1:78.05 DURING THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF LIFE THE BRAIN GROWS TO ITS FULL SIZE WITH MOST OF THAT GROWTH TAKING PLACE IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS THE BRAIN DEVELOPS IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE AND TO STIMULATION EVERY TIME A YOUNG BABY LEARNS SOMETHING NEW
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@78.05:84.11 TO FOCUS ITS EYES TO MIMIC A MOVEMENT OR A FACIAL EXPRESSION TO PICK SOMETHING UP
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@89.9:107.26 NEW PARENTS ARE ASTONISHED BY THE RAPIDITY OF THIS LEARNING THEY ARE QUITE RIGHTLY AMAZED AND DELIGHTED BY THEIR CHILDREN 'S CLEVERNESS THEY COMMUNICATE THEIR DELIGHT TO THEIR CHILDREN WHO RESPOND WITH SMILES AND A DESIRE TO ACHIEVE MORE AND TO LEARN MORE
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@107.51:117.89 THIS FORMING OF THE POWERFUL ATTACHMENT BETWEEN CHILD AND PARENT PROVIDES THE BUILDING BLOCKS FOR PHYSICAL SOCIAL LANGUAGE COGNITIVE AND PSYCHOMOTOR DEVELOPMENT
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@118.31:125.13 IT IS THE MODEL FOR ALL FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS WITH FRIENDS WITH PARTNERS AND WITH THEIR OWN CHILDREN
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@125.51:142.6 IT HAPPENS SO NATURALLY IN MOST FAMILIES THAT WE DON 'T EVEN NOTICE IT MOST OF US ARE UNAWARE OF ITS IMPORTANCE TO HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND BY EXTENSION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HEALTHY SOCIETY AND IT 'S ONLY WHEN IT GOES WRONG THAT WE START TO REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILIES TO CHILDREN
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@142.85:154.96 IN AUGUST ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE I HAD MY FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO WITNESS ON A MASSIVE SCALE THE IMPACT ON CHILDREN OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION AND THE ABSENCE OF PARENTING
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@172.54:178.96 HOUSING FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BABIES THIS WAS CEAUSESCU 'S SHOW ORPHANAGE AND SO I 'D BEEN TOLD THE CONDITIONS WERE MUCH BETTER
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@179.3:184.3 HAVING WORKED WITH LOTS OF YOUNG CHILDREN I EXPECTED THE INSTITUTION TO BE A RIOT OF NOISE
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@184.44:186.43 BUT IT WAS AS SILENT AS A CONVENT
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@205.08:212.2 YET I COULD SEE SOILED NAPPIES AND I COULD SEE THAT SOME OF THE CHILDREN WERE DISTRESSED BUT THE ONLY NOISE WAS A LOW CONTINUOUS MOAN
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@217.58:222.69 OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT THIS QUIETNESS WAS NOT EXCEPTIONAL
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@230.02:236.1 WITHIN A FEW DAYS THEY WERE LISTLESS LETHARGIC AND STARING INTO SPACE LIKE ALL THE OTHERS
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@253.46:269.1 THE CHILDREN MUST BE WOKEN AT SEVEN AND FED AT SEVEN THIRTY AT EIGHT THEIR NAPPIES MUST BE CHANGED SO A STAFF MEMBER MAY HAVE ONLY THIRTY MINUTES TO FEED TEN OR TWENTY CHILDREN IF A CHILD SOILS ITS NAPPY AT EIGHT THIRTY HE WILL HAVE TO WAIT SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE IT CAN BE CHANGED AGAIN
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@269.47:282.58 THE CHILD 'S DAILY CONTACT WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING IS REDUCED TO A FEW HURRIED MINUTES OF FEEDING AND CHANGING AND OTHERWISE THEIR ONLY STIMULATION IS THE CEILING THE WALLS OR THE BARS OF THEIR COTS
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@283.47:292.09 SINCE MY FIRST VISIT TO CEAUSESCU 'S INSTITUTION I 'VE SEEN HUNDREDS OF SUCH PLACES ACROSS EIGHTEEN COUNTRIES FROM THE CZECH REPUBLIC TO SUDAN
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@292.87:300.47 ACROSS ALL OF THESE DIVERSE LANDS AND CULTURES THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE CHILD 'S JOURNEY THROUGH THEM IS DEPRESSINGLY SIMILAR
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@300.9:308.63 LACK OF STIMULATION OFTEN LEADS TO SELF STIMULATING BEHAVIORS LIKE HAND FLAPPING ROCKING BACK AND FORTH OR AGGRESSION
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@309.05:318.61 AND IN SOME INSTITUTIONS PSYCHIATRIC DRUGS ARE USED TO CONTROL THE BEHAVIOR OF THESE CHILDREN WHILST IN OTHERS CHILDREN ARE TIED UP TO PREVENT THEM FROM HARMING THEMSELVES OR OTHERS
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@319.03:328.44 THESE CHILDREN ARE QUICKLY LABELED AS HAVING DISABILITIES AND TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES MOST OF THESE CHILDREN WILL NEVER LEAVE THE INSTITUTION AGAIN
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@329.25:336.06 FOR THOSE WITHOUT DISABILITIES AT AGE THREE THEY 'RE TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION AND AT AGE SEVEN TO YET ANOTHER
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@336.43:344.22 SEGREGATED ACCORDING TO AGE AND GENDER THEY ARE ARBITRARILY SEPARATED FROM THEIR SIBLINGS OFTEN WITHOUT EVEN A CHANCE TO SAY GOODBYE
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@354.45:360.41 WHEN THEY LEAVE THE INSTITUTION THEY FIND IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO COPE AND TO INTEGRATE INTO SOCIETY
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@360.48:367.81 IN MOLDOVA YOUNG WOMEN RAISED IN INSTITUTIONS ARE TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE TRAFFICKED THAN THEIR PEERS
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@383.34:386.64 BUT WHY ARE THERE SO MANY ORPHANS IN EUROPE
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@387.1:395.35 WHEN THERE HASN 'T BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF WAR OR DISASTER IN RECENT YEARS IN FACT MORE THAN NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THESE CHILDREN HAVE LIVING PARENTS
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@395.35:408.95 AND SOCIETIES TEND TO BLAME THESE PARENTS FOR ABANDONING THESE CHILDREN BUT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MOST PARENTS WANT THEIR CHILDREN AND THAT THE PRIMARY DRIVERS BEHIND INSTITUTIONALIZATION ARE POVERTY DISABILITY AND ETHNICITY
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@419.96:423.58 THE INSTITUTION MAY BE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY FROM THE FAMILY
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@424.03:429.56 IF THE FAMILY 'S POOR THEY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO VISIT AND GRADUALLY THE RELATIONSHIP BREAKS DOWN
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@430.57:434.88 BEHIND EACH OF THE MILLION CHILDREN IN INSTITUTIONS
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@434.96:440.56 THERE IS USUALLY A STORY OF PARENTS WHO ARE DESPERATE AND FEEL THEY 'VE RUN OUT OF OPTIONS
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@440.94:448.73 LIKE NATALIA IN MOLDOVA WHO ONLY HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO FEED HER BABY AND SO HAD TO SEND HER OLDER SON TO THE INSTITUTION
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@448.73:462.1 OR DESI IN BULGARIA WHO LOOKED AFTER HER FOUR CHILDREN AT HOME UNTIL HER HUSBAND DIED BUT THEN SHE HAD TO GO OUT TO WORK FULL TIME AND WITH NO SUPPORT FELT SHE HAD NO OPTION BUT TO PLACE A CHILD WITH DISABILITIES IN AN INSTITUTION
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@468.84:473.38 OR THE NEW PARENTS THE YOUNG COUPLE WHO HAVE JUST FOUND
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@488.78:492.65 THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IS NEITHER NECESSARY NOR IS IT INEVITABLE
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@508.44:525.58 IT 'S ALSO MUCH CHEAPER TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO FAMILIES THAN IT IS TO PROVIDE INSTITUTIONS ONE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT A FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICE COSTS TEN PERCENT OF AN INSTITUTIONAL PLACEMENT WHILST GOOD QUALITY FOSTER CARE COSTS USUALLY ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@525.84:537.28 IF WE SPEND LESS ON THESE CHILDREN BUT ON THE RIGHT SERVICES WE CAN TAKE THE SAVINGS AND REINVEST THEM IN HIGH QUALITY RESIDENTIAL CARE FOR THOSE FEW CHILDREN WITH EXTREMELY COMPLEX
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@538.25:547.41 ACROSS EUROPE A MOVEMENT IS GROWING TO SHIFT THE FOCUS AND TRANSFER THE RESOURCES FROM LARGE INSTITUTIONS THAT PROVIDE POOR QUALITY CARE
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@547.51:553.37 TO COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES THAT PROTECT CHILDREN FROM HARM AND ALLOW THEM TO DEVELOP TO THEIR FULL POTENTIAL
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@553.59:568.51 WHEN I FIRST STARTED TO WORK IN ROMANIA NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AGO THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN LIVING IN INSTITUTIONS AND MORE ENTERING EVERY DAY NOW THERE ARE LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND AND FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ACROSS THE COUNTRY
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@568.56:580.37 IN MOLDOVA DESPITE EXTREME POVERTY AND THE TERRIBLE EFFECTS OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS THE NUMBERS OF CHILDREN IN INSTITUTIONS HAS REDUCED BY MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@580.37:589.44 AND THE RESOURCES ARE BEING REDISTRIBUTED TO FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES AND INCLUSIVE SCHOOLS MANY COUNTRIES HAVE DEVELOPED NATIONAL ACTION PLANS FOR CHANGE
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@589.44:600.71 THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND OTHER MAJOR DONORS ARE FINDING WAYS TO DIVERT MONEY FROM INSTITUTIONS TOWARDS FAMILY SUPPORT EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES TO LOOK AFTER THEIR OWN CHILDREN
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S@615.66:622.1 IF WE KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE PLANNING TO SUPPORT ORPHANAGES WE SHOULD CONVINCE THEM TO SUPPORT FAMILY SERVICES INSTEAD
