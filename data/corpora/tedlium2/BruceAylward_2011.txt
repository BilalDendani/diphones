BruceAylward_2011@16.02:21.39 TO SHARE WITH YOU OVER THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MINUTES A PRETTY INCREDIBLE IDEA
BruceAylward_2011@21.47:35 ACTUALLY IT 'S A REALLY BIG IDEA BUT TO GET US STARTED I WANT TO ASK IF EVERYONE COULD JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES FOR TWO SECONDS AND TRY AND THINK OF A TECHNOLOGY OR A BIT OF SCIENCE THAT YOU THINK HAS CHANGED THE WORLD
BruceAylward_2011@38.3:52.79 NOW I BET IN THIS AUDIENCE YOU 'RE THINKING OF SOME REALLY INCREDIBLE TECHNOLOGY SOME STUFF THAT I HAVEN 'T EVEN HEARD OF I 'M ABSOLUTELY SURE BUT I 'M ALSO SURE PRETTY SURE THAT ABSOLUTELY NOBODY IS THINKING OF THIS
BruceAylward_2011@52.79:56.38 THIS IS A POLIO VACCINE
BruceAylward_2011@56.38:72.26 AND IT 'S A GREAT THING ACTUALLY THAT NOBODY 'S HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT HERE TODAY BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT WE CAN TAKE THIS FOR GRANTED THIS IS A GREAT TECHNOLOGY WE CAN TAKE IT COMPLETELY FOR GRANTED BUT IT WASN 'T ALWAYS THAT WAY EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA
BruceAylward_2011@72.26:86.69 IF WE WERE TO GO BACK JUST A FEW YEARS IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT STORY PEOPLE WERE TERRIFIED OF THIS DISEASE THEY WERE TERRIFIED OF POLIO AND IT WOULD CAUSE PUBLIC PANIC AND IT WAS BECAUSE OF SCENES LIKE THIS IN THIS SCENE PEOPLE
BruceAylward_2011@86.69:99.28 ARE LIVING IN AN IRON LUNG THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE PERFECTLY HEALTHY TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE AND THEN TWO DAYS LATER THEY CAN NO LONGER BREATHE AND THIS POLIO VIRUS HAS PARALYZED NOT ONLY THEIR ARMS AND THEIR LEGS
BruceAylward_2011@99.28:106.86 BUT ALSO THEIR BREATHING MUSCLES AND THEY WERE GOING TO SPEND THE REST OF THEIR LIVES USUALLY IN THIS IRON LUNG TO BREATHE FOR THEM
BruceAylward_2011@106.86:112.28 THIS DISEASE WAS TERRIFYING THERE WAS NO CURE AND THERE WAS NO VACCINE
BruceAylward_2011@112.28:120.08 THE DISEASE WAS SO TERRIFYING THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES LAUNCHED AN EXTRAORDINARY NATIONAL EFFORT
BruceAylward_2011@120.08:134.95 TO FIND A WAY TO STOP IT TWENTY YEARS LATER THEY SUCCEEDED AND DEVELOPED THE POLIO VACCINE IT WAS HAILED AS A SCIENTIFIC MIRACLE IN THE LATE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY S FINALLY A VACCINE THAT COULD STOP THIS AWFUL DISEASE
BruceAylward_2011@134.95:143.16 AND HERE IN THE UNITED STATES IT HAD AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT AS YOU CAN SEE THE VIRUS STOPPED AND IT STOPPED VERY VERY FAST
BruceAylward_2011@143.16:145.47 BUT
BruceAylward_2011@145.47:154.81 THIS WASN 'T THE CASE EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND IT HAPPENED SO FAST IN THE UNITED STATES HOWEVER THAT EVEN JUST LAST MONTH JON STEWART SAID
BruceAylward_2011@165.62:174.78 BUT THE REALITY IS THAT POLIO STILL EXISTS TODAY WE MADE THIS MAP FOR JON TO TRY TO SHOW HIM EXACTLY WHERE POLIO STILL EXISTS THIS IS THE PICTURE
BruceAylward_2011@174.78:191.67 THERE 'S NOT VERY MUCH LEFT IN THE WORLD BUT THE REASON THERE 'S NOT VERY MUCH LEFT IS BECAUSE THERE 'S BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES ALMOST UNKNOWN I 'M SURE TO MOST OF YOU HERE TODAY IT 'S BEEN WORKING FOR TWENTY YEARS TO TRY AND ERADICATE THIS DISEASE
BruceAylward_2011@191.67:196.37 AND IT 'S GOT IT DOWN TO THESE FEW CASES THAT YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THIS GRAPHIC
BruceAylward_2011@196.37:206.01 BUT JUST LAST YEAR WE HAD AN INCREDIBLE SHOCK AND REALIZED THAT ALMOST JUST ISN 'T GOOD ENOUGH WITH A VIRUS LIKE POLIO
BruceAylward_2011@206.17:224.02 AND THIS IS THE REASON IN TWO COUNTRIES THAT HADN 'T HAD THIS DISEASE FOR MORE THAN PROBABLY A DECADE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE GLOBE THERE WAS SUDDENLY TERRIBLE POLIO OUTBREAKS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WERE PARALYZED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE DIED CHILDREN
BruceAylward_2011@224.02:239.65 AS WELL AS ADULTS AND IN BOTH CASES WE WERE ABLE TO USE GENETIC SEQUENCING TO LOOK AT THE POLIO VIRUSES AND WE COULD TELL THESE VIRUSES WERE NOT FROM THESE COUNTRIES THEY HAD COME FROM THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY AND IN ONE CASE IT ORIGINATED ON ANOTHER CONTINENT
BruceAylward_2011@239.65:259.27 AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT WHEN THEY CAME INTO THESE COUNTRIES THEN THEY GOT ON COMMERCIAL JETLINERS PROBABLY AND THEY TRAVELED EVEN FARTHER TO OTHER PLACES LIKE RUSSIA WHERE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER A DECADE LAST YEAR CHILDREN WERE CRIPPLED AND PARALYZED BY A DISEASE THAT THEY HAD NOT SEEN FOR YEARS
BruceAylward_2011@259.27:270.31 NOW ALL OF THESE OUTBREAKS THAT I JUST SHOWED YOU THESE ARE UNDER CONTROL NOW AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY 'LL PROBABLY STOP VERY VERY QUICKLY BUT THE MESSAGE WAS VERY CLEAR
BruceAylward_2011@270.31:279.86 POLIO IS STILL A DEVASTATING EXPLOSIVE DISEASE IT 'S JUST HAPPENING IN ANOTHER PART OF THE WORLD
BruceAylward_2011@279.86:296.61 AND OUR BIG IDEA IS THAT THE SCIENTIFIC MIRACLE OF THIS DECADE SHOULD BE THE COMPLETE ERADICATION OF POLIOMYELITIS SO I WANT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THIS PARTNERSHIP THE POLIO PARTNERSHIP IS TRYING TO DO
BruceAylward_2011@296.61:301.21 WE 'RE NOT TRYING TO CONTROL POLIO WE 'RE NOT TRYING TO GET IT DOWN TO JUST A FEW CASES
BruceAylward_2011@301.21:319.89 BECAUSE THIS DISEASE IS LIKE A ROOT FIRE IT CAN EXPLODE AGAIN IF YOU DON 'T SNUFF IT OUT COMPLETELY SO WHAT WE 'RE LOOKING FOR IS A PERMANENT SOLUTION WE WANT A WORLD IN WHICH EVERY CHILD JUST LIKE YOU GUYS CAN TAKE FOR GRANTED A POLIO FREE WORLD SO WE 'RE LOOKING FOR A PERMANENT SOLUTION
BruceAylward_2011@319.89:330.02 AND THIS IS WHERE WE GET LUCKY THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW VIRUSES IN THE WORLD WHERE THERE ARE BIG ENOUGH CRACKS IN ITS ARMOR THAT WE CAN TRY TO DO SOMETHING TRULY EXTRAORDINARY
BruceAylward_2011@330.02:340.55 THIS VIRUS CAN ONLY SURVIVE IN PEOPLE IT CAN 'T LIVE FOR A VERY LONG TIME IN PEOPLE IT DOESN 'T SURVIVE IN THE ENVIRONMENT HARDLY AT ALL AND WE 'VE GOT PRETTY GOOD VACCINES AS I 'VE JUST SHOWED YOU
BruceAylward_2011@340.55:354.41 SO WE ARE TRYING TO WIPE OUT THIS VIRUS COMPLETELY WHAT THE POLIO ERADICATION PROGRAM IS TRYING TO DO IS TO KILL THE VIRUS ITSELF THAT CAUSES POLIO EVERYWHERE ON EARTH
BruceAylward_2011@354.41:367.44 NOW WE DON 'T HAVE A GREAT TRACK RECORD WHEN IT COMES TO DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO ERADICATING DISEASES IT 'S BEEN TRIED SIX TIMES IN THE LAST CENTURY AND IT 'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL EXACTLY ONCE
BruceAylward_2011@367.44:377.48 AND THIS IS BECAUSE DISEASE ERADICATION IT 'S STILL THE VENTURE CAPITAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE RISKS ARE MASSIVE BUT THE PAY OFF
BruceAylward_2011@377.87:397.06 ECONOMIC HUMANITARIAN MOTIVATIONAL IT 'S ABSOLUTELY HUGE ONE CONGRESSMAN HERE IN THE UNITED STATES THINKS THAT THE ENTIRE INVESTMENT THAT THE U S PUT INTO SMALLPOX ERADICATION PAYS ITSELF OFF EVERY TWENTY SIX DAYS IN FOREGONE TREATMENT COSTS AND VACCINATION COSTS
BruceAylward_2011@397.06:413.21 AND IF WE CAN FINISH POLIO ERADICATION THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD ARE GOING TO SAVE OVER FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IN THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS ALONE SO THOSE ARE THE KIND OF STAKES THAT WE 'RE AFTER BUT
BruceAylward_2011@413.33:421.8 SMALLPOX ERADICATION WAS HARD IT WAS VERY VERY HARD AND POLIO ERADICATION IN MANY WAYS IS EVEN TOUGHER AND THERE 'S A FEW REASONS FOR THAT
BruceAylward_2011@421.83:423.74 THE FIRST
BruceAylward_2011@424.04:425.84 IS THAT WHEN WE STARTED TRYING
BruceAylward_2011@433.46:452.49 AND THERE WERE MORE THAN TEN TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE LIVING IN THESE COUNTRIES SO IT WAS A MASSIVE EFFORT THE SECOND CHALLENGE WE HAD WAS IN CONTRAST TO THE SMALLPOX VACCINE WHICH WAS VERY STABLE AND A SINGLE DOSE PROTECTED YOU FOR LIFE THE POLIO VACCINE IS INCREDIBLY FRAGILE IT DETERIORATES SO QUICKLY IN THE TROPICS
BruceAylward_2011@452.49:468.99 THAT WE 'VE HAD TO PUT THIS SPECIAL VACCINE MONITOR ON EVERY SINGLE VIAL SO THAT IT WILL CHANGE VERY QUICKLY WHEN IT 'S EXPOSED TO TOO MUCH HEAT AND WE CAN TELL THAT IT 'S NOT A GOOD VACCINE TO USE ON A CHILD IT 'S NOT POTENT IT 'S NOT GOING TO PROTECT THEM EVEN THEN KIDS NEED MANY DOSES OF THE VACCINE
BruceAylward_2011@468.99:473.19 BUT THE THIRD CHALLENGE WE HAVE AND PROBABLY EVEN BIGGER ONE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE
BruceAylward_2011@473.19:486.24 IS THAT IN CONTRAST TO SMALLPOX WHERE YOU COULD ALWAYS SEE YOUR ENEMY EVERY SINGLE PERSON ALMOST WHO WAS INFECTED WITH SMALLPOX HAD THIS TELLTALE RASH SO YOU COULD GET AROUND THE DISEASE YOU COULD VACCINATE AROUND THE DISEASE AND CUT IT OFF
BruceAylward_2011@505.94:510.56 WE 'VE HAD TO CREATE ONE OF THE LARGEST SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IN HISTORY
BruceAylward_2011@510.56:524.8 THERE 'S OVER TEN MILLION PEOPLE PROBABLY TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE LARGELY VOLUNTEERS WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IN WHAT HAS NOW BEEN CALLED THE LARGEST INTERNATIONALLY COORDINATED OPERATION IN PEACETIME
BruceAylward_2011@524.8:536.5 THESE PEOPLE THESE TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE VACCINATE OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION CHILDREN EVERY SINGLE YEAR MULTIPLE TIMES AT THE PEAK OF OUR OPERATION
BruceAylward_2011@536.5:545.66 NOW GIVING THE POLIO VACCINE IS SIMPLE IT 'S JUST TWO DROPS LIKE THAT BUT REACHING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE IS MUCH MUCH TOUGHER
BruceAylward_2011@545.66:563.22 AND THESE VACCINATORS THESE VOLUNTEERS THEY HAVE GOT TO DIVE HEADLONG INTO SOME OF THE TOUGHEST DENSEST URBAN SLUMS IN THE WORLD THEY 'VE GOT TO TREK UNDER SWELTERING SUNS TO SOME OF THE MOST REMOTE DIFFICULT TO REACH PLACES IN THE WORLD AND THEY ALSO HAVE TO DODGE BULLETS
BruceAylward_2011@563.22:572.51 BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT TO OPERATE DURING SHAKY CEASE FIRES AND TRUCES TO TRY AND VACCINATE CHILDREN EVEN IN AREAS AFFECTED BY CONFLICT
BruceAylward_2011@572.51:591.51 ONE REPORTER WHO WAS WATCHING OUR PROGRAM IN SOMALIA ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO A PLACE WHICH HAS ERADICATED POLIO NOT ONCE BUT TWICE BECAUSE THEY GOT REINFECTED HE WAS SITTING OUTSIDE OF THE ROAD WATCHING ONE OF THESE POLIO CAMPAIGNS UNFOLD AND A FEW MONTHS LATER HE WROTE THIS IS FOREIGN AID AT ITS MOST HEROIC
BruceAylward_2011@591.51:609.4 AND THESE HEROES THEY COME FROM EVERY WALK OF LIFE ALL SORTS OF BACKGROUNDS BUT ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY IS ROTARY INTERNATIONAL THIS IS A GROUP WHOSE MILLION STRONG ARMY OF VOLUNTEERS HAVE BEEN WORKING TO ERADICATE POLIO FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS THEY 'RE RIGHT AT THE CENTER OF THE WHOLE THING
BruceAylward_2011@609.4:619.31 NOW IT TOOK YEARS TO BUILD UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR POLIO ERADICATION MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS MUCH LONGER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BUT ONCE IT WAS BUILT THE RESULTS WERE STRIKING
BruceAylward_2011@619.31:634.16 WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS EVERY COUNTRY THAT STARTED POLIO ERADICATION RAPIDLY ERADICATED ALL THREE OF THEIR POLIO VIRUSES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FOUR COUNTRIES THAT YOU SEE HERE AND IN EACH OF THOSE IT WAS ONLY PART OF THE COUNTRY
BruceAylward_2011@634.16:647.78 AND THEN BY ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE ONE OF THE THREE POLIO VIRUSES THAT WE WERE TRYING TO ERADICATE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY ERADICATED WORLDWIDE PROOF OF CONCEPT AND THEN TODAY
BruceAylward_2011@648.18:667.23 THERE 'S BEEN A NINETY NINE PERCENT REDUCTION GREATER THAN NINETY NINE PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO ARE BEING PARALYZED BY THIS AWFUL DISEASE WHEN WE STARTED OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO ONE THOUSAND CHILDREN WERE BEING PARALYZED EVERY SINGLE DAY BY THIS VIRUS LAST YEAR IT WAS ONE THOUSAND
BruceAylward_2011@667.23:678.24 AND AT THE SAME TIME THE POLIO ERADICATION PROGRAM HAS BEEN WORKING TO HELP WITH A LOT OF OTHER AREAS IT 'S BEEN WORKING TO HELP CONTROL PANDEMIC FLU SARS FOR EXAMPLE
BruceAylward_2011@678.24:688.17 IT 'S ALSO TRIED TO SAVE CHILDREN BY DOING OTHER THINGS GIVING VITAMIN A DROPS GIVING MEASLES SHOTS GIVING BED NETS AGAINST MALARIA EVEN DURING SOME OF THESE CAMPAIGNS
BruceAylward_2011@688.17:696.28 BUT THE MOST EXCITING THING THAT THE POLIO ERADICATION PROGRAM HAS BEEN DOING HAS BEEN TO FORCE US THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
BruceAylward_2011@696.28:710.96 TO REACH EVERY SINGLE CHILD EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WITH THE MOST BASIC OF HEALTH SERVICES IRRESPECTIVE OF GEOGRAPHY POVERTY CULTURE AND EVEN CONFLICT
BruceAylward_2011@710.96:718.15 SO THINGS WERE LOOKING VERY EXCITING AND THEN ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO THIS VIRUS THIS ANCIENT VIRUS STARTED TO FIGHT BACK
BruceAylward_2011@718.15:727.42 THE FIRST PROBLEM WE RAN INTO WAS THAT IN THESE LAST FOUR COUNTRIES THE STRONGHOLDS OF THIS VIRUS WE JUST COULDN 'T SEEM TO GET THE VIRUS ROOTED OUT
BruceAylward_2011@727.42:744.17 AND THEN TO MAKE THE MATTERS EVEN WORSE THE VIRUS STARTED TO SPREAD OUT OF THESE FOUR PLACES ESPECIALLY NORTHERN INDIA AND NORTHERN NIGERIA INTO MUCH OF AFRICA ASIA AND EVEN INTO EUROPE CAUSING HORRIFIC OUTBREAKS IN PLACES THAT HAD NOT SEEN THIS DISEASE FOR DECADES
BruceAylward_2011@744.17:746.77 AND THEN
BruceAylward_2011@746.77:765.69 IN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TENACIOUS AND TOUGHEST RESERVOIRS OF THE POLIO VIRUS IN THE WORLD WE FOUND THAT OUR VACCINE WAS WORKING HALF AS WELL AS IT SHOULD HAVE IN CONDITIONS LIKE THIS THE VACCINE JUST COULDN 'T GET THE GRIP IT NEEDED TO IN THE GUTS OF THESE CHILDREN AND PROTECT THEM THE WAY THAT IT NEEDED TO
BruceAylward_2011@765.69:784.7 NOW AT THAT TIME THERE WAS A GREAT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE FRUSTRATION LET 'S CALL IT FRUSTRATION IT STARTED TO GROW VERY VERY QUICKLY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SOME VERY IMPORTANT VOICES IN THE WORLD OF PUBLIC HEALTH STARTED TO SAY HANG ON WE SHOULD ABANDON THIS IDEA OF ERADICATION LET 'S SETTLE FOR CONTROL THAT 'S GOOD ENOUGH
BruceAylward_2011@784.7:791.21 NOW AS SEDUCTIVE AS THE IDEA OF CONTROL SOUNDS IT 'S A FALSE PREMISE
BruceAylward_2011@791.21:806.4 THE BRUTAL TRUTH IS IF WE DON 'T HAVE THE WILL OR THE SKILL OR EVEN THE MONEY THAT WE NEED TO REACH CHILDREN THE MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN IN THE WORLD WITH SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS AN ORAL POLIO VACCINE
BruceAylward_2011@806.4:818.84 THEN PRETTY SOON MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN ARE AGAIN GOING TO BE PARALYZED BY THIS DISEASE EVERY SINGLE YEAR THERE 'S ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION THESE ARE CHILDREN LIKE
BruceAylward_2011@819.33:828.7 UMAR IS SEVEN YEARS OLD AND HE 'S FROM NORTHERN NIGERIA HE LIVES IN A FAMILY HOME THERE WITH HIS EIGHT BROTHERS AND SISTERS
BruceAylward_2011@850.79:865.52 BUT UMAR IS A FANTASTIC STUDENT HE 'S AN INCREDIBLE KID AS YOU PROBABLY CAN 'T SEE THE DETAIL HERE BUT THIS IS HIS REPORT CARD AND YOU 'LL SEE HE 'S GOT PERFECT SCORES HE GOT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT IN ALL THE IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE NURSERY RHYMES FOR EXAMPLE THERE
BruceAylward_2011@865.52:877.22 BUT YOU KNOW I 'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU THAT UMAR IS A TYPICAL KID WITH POLIO THESE DAYS BUT IT 'S NOT TRUE UMAR IS AN EXCEPTIONAL KID IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES
BruceAylward_2011@877.22:884.96 THE REALITY OF POLIO TODAY IS SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT POLIO STRIKES THE POOREST COMMUNITIES IN THE WORLD
BruceAylward_2011@885.15:887.97 IT LEAVES THEIR CHILDREN PARALYZED AND
BruceAylward_2011@899.94:905.96 WE THINK CHILDREN DESERVE BETTER AND SO
BruceAylward_2011@917.92:937.34 AND TRY AND FIND INNOVATIVE NEW SOLUTIONS NEW WAYS TO GET TO THE CHILDREN THAT WE WERE MISSING AGAIN AND AGAIN IN NORTHERN INDIA WE STARTED MAPPING THE CASES USING SATELLITE IMAGING LIKE THIS SO THAT WE COULD GUIDE OUR INVESTMENTS AND VACCINATOR SHELTERS SO WE COULD GET TO THE MILLIONS OF CHILDREN ON THE KOSHI RIVER BASIN WHERE THERE ARE NO OTHER HEALTH SERVICES
BruceAylward_2011@937.34:947.58 IN NORTHERN NIGERIA THE POLITICAL LEADERS AND THE TRADITIONAL MUSLIM LEADERS THEY GOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE PROGRAM TO HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF LOGISTICS AND COMMUNITY CONFIDENCE
BruceAylward_2011@947.58:952.12 AND NOW THEY 'VE EVEN STARTED USING THESE DEVICES SPEAKING OF COOL TECHNOLOGY
BruceAylward_2011@952.12:970.8 THESE LITTLE DEVICES LITTLE GIS TRACKERS LIKE THIS WHICH THEY PUT INTO THE VACCINE CARRIERS OF THEIR VACCINATORS AND THEN THEY CAN TRACK THEM AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY LOOK AND SEE DID THESE GUYS GET EVERY SINGLE STREET EVERY SINGLE HOUSE THIS IS THE KIND OF COMMITMENT NOW WE 'RE SEEING TO TRY AND REACH ALL OF THE CHILDREN WE 'VE BEEN MISSING
BruceAylward_2011@970.8:981.24 AND IN AFGHANISTAN WE 'RE TRYING NEW APPROACHES ACCESS NEGOTIATORS WE 'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN REACH EVERY CHILD
BruceAylward_2011@981.24:998.59 BUT AS WE TRIED THESE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS AS PEOPLE WENT TO THIS TROUBLE TO TRY AND REWORK THEIR TACTICS WE WENT BACK TO THE VACCINE IT 'S A FIFTY YEAR OLD VACCINE AND WE THOUGHT SURELY WE CAN MAKE A BETTER VACCINE SO THAT WHEN THEY FINALLY GET TO THESE KIDS WE CAN HAVE A BETTER BANG FOR OUR BUCK
BruceAylward_2011@998.59:1001.78 AND THIS STARTED AN INCREDIBLE COLLABORATION WITH INDUSTRY
BruceAylward_2011@1001.78:1019.07 AND WITHIN SIX MONTHS WE WERE TESTING A NEW POLIO VACCINE THAT TARGETED JUST TWO YEARS AGO THE LAST TWO TYPES OF POLIO IN THE WORLD NOW JUNE THE NINTH TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WE GOT THE FIRST RESULTS FROM THE FIRST TRIAL WITH THIS VACCINE AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A GAME CHANGER
BruceAylward_2011@1019.07:1025.79 THE NEW VACCINE HAD TWICE THE IMPACT ON THESE LAST COUPLE OF VIRUSES AS THE OLD VACCINE HAD
BruceAylward_2011@1025.79:1030.29 AND WE IMMEDIATELY STARTED USING THIS WELL IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS WE HAD TO GET IT OUT OF PRODUCTION
BruceAylward_2011@1046.84:1056.72 NOW HERE AT TED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS I 'VE SEEN PEOPLE CHALLENGING THE AUDIENCE AGAIN AND AGAIN TO BELIEVE IN THE IMPOSSIBLE
BruceAylward_2011@1056.72:1075.41 SO THIS MORNING AT ABOUT SEVEN O 'CLOCK I DECIDED THAT WE 'D TRY TO DRIVE CHRIS AND THE PRODUCTION CREW HERE BERSERK BY DOWNLOADING ALL OF OUR DATA FROM INDIA AGAIN SO THAT YOU COULD SEE SOMETHING THAT 'S JUST UNFOLDING TODAY WHICH PROVES THAT THE IMPOSSIBLE IS POSSIBLE
BruceAylward_2011@1091.02:1100.02 FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN EVERY SINGLE MONTH SANITATION IS TERRIBLE AND OUR OLD VACCINE YOU REMEMBER WORKED HALF AS WELL AS IT SHOULD HAVE
BruceAylward_2011@1100.02:1103.46 AND YET THE IMPOSSIBLE IS HAPPENING
BruceAylward_2011@1124.95:1137.39 INDIA 'S NOT UNIQUE IN UMAR 'S HOME COUNTRY OF NIGERIA A NINETY FIVE PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN PARALYZED BY POLIO LAST YEAR AND IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS WE 'VE HAD LESS PLACES
BruceAylward_2011@1137.39:1151.61 REINFECTED BY POLIO THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME IN HISTORY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WITH A COMBINATION OF SMART PEOPLE SMART TECHNOLOGY AND SMART INVESTMENTS POLIO CAN NOW BE ERADICATED ANYWHERE
BruceAylward_2011@1151.79:1165.81 WE HAVE MAJOR CHALLENGES YOU CAN IMAGINE TO FINISH THIS JOB BUT AS YOU 'VE ALSO SEEN IT 'S DOABLE IT HAS GREAT SECONDARY BENEFITS AND POLIO ERADICATION IS A GREAT BUY
BruceAylward_2011@1165.81:1185.45 AND AS LONG AS ANY CHILD ANYWHERE IS PARALYZED BY THIS VIRUS IT 'S A STARK REMINDER THAT WE ARE FAILING AS A SOCIETY TO REACH CHILDREN WITH THE MOST BASIC OF SERVICES AND FOR THAT REASON POLIO ERADICATION IT 'S THE ULTIMATE IN EQUITY AND IT 'S THE ULTIMATE IN SOCIAL JUSTICE
BruceAylward_2011@1185.45:1203.96 THE HUGE SOCIAL MOVEMENT THAT 'S BEEN INVOLVED IN POLIO ERADICATION IS READY TO DO WAY MORE FOR THESE CHILDREN IT 'S READY TO REACH THEM WITH BED NETS WITH OTHER THINGS BUT CAPITALIZING ON THEIR ENTHUSIASM CAPITALIZING ON THEIR ENERGY MEANS FINISHING THE JOB THAT THEY STARTED TWENTY YEARS AGO
BruceAylward_2011@1203.96:1209.66 FINISHING POLIO IS A SMART THING TO DO AND IT 'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO
BruceAylward_2011@1209.66:1222.59 NOW WE 'RE IN TOUGH TIMES ECONOMICALLY BUT AS DAVID CAMERON OF THE UNITED KINGDOM SAID ABOUT A MONTH AGO WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT POLIO THERE 'S NEVER A WRONG TIME TO DO THE RIGHT THING
BruceAylward_2011@1222.59:1236.39 FINISHING POLIO ERADICATION IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND WE ARE AT A CROSSROADS RIGHT NOW IN THIS GREAT EFFORT OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WE HAVE A NEW VACCINE WE HAVE NEW RESOLVE AND WE HAVE NEW TACTICS
BruceAylward_2011@1236.39:1247.16 WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO WRITE AN ENTIRELY NEW POLIO FREE CHAPTER IN HUMAN HISTORY BUT IF WE BLINK NOW
BruceAylward_2011@1247.49:1254.01 WE WILL LOSE FOREVER THE CHANCE TO ERADICATE AN ANCIENT DISEASE
BruceAylward_2011@1254.01:1268.92 HERE 'S A GREAT IDEA TO SPREAD END POLIO NOW HELP US TELL THE STORY HELP US BUILD THE MOMENTUM SO THAT VERY SOON EVERY CHILD EVERY PARENT EVERYWHERE
BruceAylward_2011@1268.99:1273.42 CAN ALSO TAKE FOR GRANTED A POLIO FREE LIFE
BruceAylward_2011@1273.67:1276.15 FOREVER THANK YOU
BruceAylward_2011@1299.21:1305.69 WHERE DO YOU THINK THE TOUGHEST PLACES ARE GOING TO BE WHERE WOULD YOU SAY WE NEED TO BE THE SMARTEST BA THE FOUR
BruceAylward_2011@1305.69:1322.18 PLACES WHERE YOU SAW THAT WE 'VE NEVER STOPPED NORTHERN NIGERIA NORTHERN INDIA THE SOUTHERN CORNER OF AFGHANISTAN AND BORDERING AREAS OF PAKISTAN THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THE TOUGHEST BUT THE INTERESTING THING IS OF THOSE THREE INDIA 'S LOOKING REAL GOOD AS YOU JUST SAW IN THE DATA AND AFGHANISTAN AFGHANISTAN WE THINK
