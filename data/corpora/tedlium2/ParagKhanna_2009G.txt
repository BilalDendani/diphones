ParagKhanna_2009G@13.41:23.18 WE LIVE IN A BORDERLESS WORLD BEFORE YOU ANSWER THAT HAVE A LOOK AT THIS MAP CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL MAP SHOWS THAT WE HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD TODAY
ParagKhanna_2009G@33.66:47.24 IN TEDISTAN THERE ARE NO BORDERS JUST CONNECTED SPACES AND UNCONNECTED SPACES MOST OF YOU PROBABLY RESIDE IN ONE OF THE FORTY DOTS ON THIS SCREEN OF THE MANY MORE THAT REPRESENT NINETY PERCENT OF THE WORLD ECONOMY
ParagKhanna_2009G@47.71:61.35 BUT LET 'S TALK ABOUT THE NINETY PERCENT OF THE WORLD POPULATION THAT WILL NEVER LEAVE THE PLACE IN WHICH THEY WERE BORN FOR THEM NATIONS COUNTRIES BOUNDARIES BORDERS STILL MATTER A GREAT DEAL AND OFTEN VIOLENTLY
ParagKhanna_2009G@62.12:74.06 NOW HERE AT TED WE'RE SOLVING SOME OF THE GREAT RIDDLES OF SCIENCE AND MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE WELL HERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WE HAVE NOT SOLVED OUR BASIC POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY HOW DO WE DISTRIBUTE OURSELVES AROUND THE WORLD
ParagKhanna_2009G@74.79:80.23 NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE BORDER CONFLICTS JUSTIFY SO MUCH OF THE WORLD 'S MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX
ParagKhanna_2009G@80.56:89.63 BORDER CONFLICTS CAN DERAIL SO MUCH OF THE PROGRESS THAT WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE HERE SO I THINK WE NEED A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW PEOPLE MONEY POWER
ParagKhanna_2009G@90.48:99.25 RELIGION CULTURE TECHNOLOGY INTERACT TO CHANGE THE MAP OF THE WORLD AND WE CAN TRY TO ANTICIPATE THOSE CHANGES AND SHAPE THEM IN A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE DIRECTION
ParagKhanna_2009G@112.00:122.79 JUST ONE HUNDRED COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD AFTER WORLD WAR II EUROPE WAS DEVASTATED BUT STILL HELD LARGE OVERSEAS COLONIES FRENCH WEST AFRICA BRITISH EAST AFRICA SOUTH ASIA AND SO FORTH
ParagKhanna_2009G@123.82:137.49 THEN OVER THE LATE FORTIES FIFTIES SIXTIES SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES WAVES OF DECOLONIZATION TOOK PLACE OVER FIFTY NEW COUNTRIES WERE BORN YOU CAN SEE THAT AFRICA HAS BEEN FRAGMENTED INDIA PAKISTAN BANGLADESH SOUTH EAST ASIAN NATIONS CREATED
ParagKhanna_2009G@138.27:146.93 THEN CAME THE END OF THE COLD WAR THE END OF THE COLD WAR AND THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE SOVIET UNION YOU HAD THE CREATION OF NEW STATES IN EASTERN EUROPE
ParagKhanna_2009G@147.20:155.19 THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLICS AND THE BALKANS AND THE STANS OF CENTRAL ASIA TODAY WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD
ParagKhanna_2009G@165.65:178.06 LET 'S ZOOM IN ON ONE OF THE MOST STRATEGIC AREAS OF THE WORLD EASTERN EURASIA AS YOU CAN SEE ON THIS MAP RUSSIA IS STILL THE LARGEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND AS YOU KNOW CHINA IS THE MOST POPULOUS AND THEY SHARE A LENGTHY LAND BORDER
ParagKhanna_2009G@191.79:200.69 IN FACT THE WORLD BANK PREDICTS THAT RUSSIA 'S POPULATION IS DECLINING TOWARDS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE AND THERE IS ANOTHER THING THAT YOU DON'T SEE ON THIS MAP
ParagKhanna_2009G@210.51:216.71 BUT AS OIL PRICES ROSE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENTS HAVE INVESTED IN INFRASTRUCTURE TO UNITE THE COUNTRY EAST AND WEST
ParagKhanna_2009G@217.02:227.68 BUT NOTHING HAS MORE PERVERSELY IMPACTED RUSSIA 'S DEMOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN THE EAST WHO NEVER WANTED TO BE THERE ANYWAY HAVE GOTTEN ON THOSE TRAINS AND ROADS AND GONE BACK TO THE WEST
ParagKhanna_2009G@228.14:236.07 AS A RESULT IN THE RUSSIAN FAR EAST TODAY WHICH IS TWICE THE SIZE OF INDIA YOU HAVE EXACTLY SIX MILLION RUSSIANS
ParagKhanna_2009G@236.66:245.59 SO LETS GET A SENSE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD WE CAN START WITH MONGOLIA OR AS SOME CALL IT MINE GOLIA WHY DO THEY CALL IT THAT BECAUSE IN MINE GOLIA
ParagKhanna_2009G@246.07:258.08 CHINESE FIRMS OPERATE AND OWN MOST OF THE MINES COPPER ZINC GOLD AND THEY TRUCK THE RESOURCES SOUTH AND EAST INTO MAINLAND CHINA CHINA ISN'T CONQUERING MONGOLIA IT'S BUYING IT
ParagKhanna_2009G@271.63:282.19 BUT IN FACT WITH GLOBAL WARMING AND RISING TEMPERATURES ALL OF THE SUDDEN YOU HAVE VAST WHEAT FIELDS AND AGRIBUSINESS AND GRAIN BEING PRODUCED IN SIBERIA BUT WHO IS IT GOING TO FEED
ParagKhanna_2009G@304.20:311.82 THEY SET UP THEIR OWN BAZAARS AND MEDICAL CLINICS THEY'VE TAKEN OVER THE TIMBER INDUSTRY AND BEEN SHIPPING THE LUMBER EAST BACK INTO CHINA
ParagKhanna_2009G@312.60:320.86 AGAIN LIKE MONGOLIA CHINA ISN'T CONQUERING RUSSIA IT'S JUST LEASING IT THAT'S WHAT I CALL GLOBALIZATION CHINESE STYLE
ParagKhanna_2009G@321.48:329.08 NOW MAYBE THIS IS WHAT THE MAP OF THE REGION MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN TEN TO TWENTY YEARS BUT HOLD ON THIS MAP IS SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS OLD
ParagKhanna_2009G@329.80:339.25 THIS IS THE MAP OF THE YUAN DYNASTY LEAD BY KUBLA KHAN THE GRANDSON OF GENGHIS KHAN SO HISTORY DOESN'T NECESSARILY REPEAT ITSELF BUT IT DOES RHYME
ParagKhanna_2009G@339.83:354.51 THIS IS JUST TO GIVE YOU A TASTE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD AGAIN GLOBALIZATION CHINESE STYLE BECAUSE GLOBALIZATION OPENS UP ALL KINDS OF WAYS FOR US TO UNDERMINE AND CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY SO
ParagKhanna_2009G@354.78:362.98 THE HISTORY OF EAST ASIA IN FACT PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT NATIONS AND BORDERS THEY THINK MORE IN TERMS OF EMPIRES AND HIERARCHIES USUALLY CHINESE OR JAPANESE
ParagKhanna_2009G@363.33:375.66 WELL IT'S CHINA 'S TURN AGAIN SO LET 'S LOOK AT HOW CHINA IS RESTABLISHING THAT HIERARCHY IN THE FAR EAST IT STARTS WITH THE GLOBAL HUBS REMEMBER THE FORTY DOTS ON THE NIGHTTIME MAP THAT SHOW THE HUBS OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
ParagKhanna_2009G@376.14:385.00 EAST ASIA TODAY HAS MORE OF THOSE GLOBAL HUBS THAN ANY OTHER REGION IN THE WORLD TOKYO SEOUL BEIJING SHANGHAI HONG KONG SINGAPORE
ParagKhanna_2009G@385.33:394.14 AND SIDNEY THESE ARE THE FILTERS AND FUNNELS OF GLOBAL CAPITAL TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR BEING BROUGHT INTO THE REGION SO MUCH OF IT BEING INVESTED INTO CHINA
ParagKhanna_2009G@395.02:405.59 THEN THERE IS TRADE THESE VECTORS AND ARROWS REPRESENT EVER STRONGER TRADE RELATIONSHIPS THAT CHINA HAS WITH EVERY COUNTRY IN THE REGION SPECIFICALLY IT TARGETS JAPAN AND KOREA
ParagKhanna_2009G@405.95:414.63 AND AUSTRALIA COUNTRIES THAT ARE STRONG ALLIES OF THE UNITED STATES AUSTRALIA FOR EXAMPLE IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON EXPORTING IRON ORE NATURAL GAS TO CHINA
ParagKhanna_2009G@415.04:425.70 FOR POORER COUNTRIES CHINA REDUCES TARIFFS SO THAT LAOS AND CAMBODIA CAN SELL THEIR GOODS MORE CHEAPLY AND BECOME DEPENDENT ON EXPORTING TO CHINA AS WELL AND NOW MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN READING IN THE NEWS HOW
ParagKhanna_2009G@440.54:446.36 SO CHINA IS BECOMING THE ANCHOR OF THE ECONOMY IN THE REGION ANOTHER PILLAR OF THIS STRATEGY IS DIPLOMACY
ParagKhanna_2009G@446.87:455.51 CHINA HAS SIGNED MILITARY AGREEMENTS WITH MANY COUNTRIES IN THE REGION IT HAS BECOME THE HUB OF DIPLOMATIC INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE EAST ASIAN COMMUNITY
ParagKhanna_2009G@455.89:464.29 SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS DON'T EVEN HAVE THE UNITED STATES AS A MEMBER THERE IS A TREATY OF NONAGGRESSION BETWEEN COUNTRIES SUCH THAT IF THERE WERE A CONFLICT BETWEEN CHINA
ParagKhanna_2009G@471.95:482.17 ANOTHER PILLAR OF THE STRATEGY LIKE RUSSIA IS DEMOGRAPHIC CHINA EXPORTS BUSINESS PEOPLE NANNIES STUDENTS TEACHERS TO TEACH CHINESE AROUND THE REGION TO INTERMARRY
ParagKhanna_2009G@482.57:491.25 AND TO OCCUPY EVER GREATER COMMANDING HEIGHTS OF THE ECONOMIES ALREADY ETHNIC CHINESE PEOPLE IN MALAYSIA THAILAND AND INDONESIA
ParagKhanna_2009G@491.95:498.79 ARE THE REAL KEY FACTORS AND DRIVERS IN THE ECONOMIES THERE CHINESE PRIDE IS RESURGENT IN THE REGION
ParagKhanna_2009G@499.21:507.45 AS A RESULT SINGAPORE FOR EXAMPLE USED TO BAN CHINESE LANGUAGE EDUCATION NOW IT ENCOURAGES IT IF YOU ADD IT ALL UP WHAT DO YOU GET
ParagKhanna_2009G@507.95:519.07 WELL IF YOU REMEMBER BEFORE WORLD WAR II JAPAN HAD A VISION FOR A GREATER JAPANESE CO PROSPERITY SPHERE WHAT'S EMERGING TODAY IS WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A GREATER CHINESE
ParagKhanna_2009G@519.39:533.43 SO NO MATTER WHAT THE LINES ON THE MAP TELL YOU IN TERMS OF NATIONS AND BORDERS WHAT YOU REALLY HAVE EMERGING IN THE FAR EAST ARE NATIONAL CULTURES BUT IN A MUCH MORE FLUID IMPERIAL ZONE ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING WITHOUT FIRING A SHOT
ParagKhanna_2009G@534.06:542.43 THAT'S MOST CERTAINLY NOT THE CASE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WHERE COUNTRIES ARE STILL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE BORDERS LEFT BEHIND BY EUROPEAN COLONIALISTS
ParagKhanna_2009G@542.85:550.39 SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO THINK ABOUT BORDERS DIFFERENTLY IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD WHAT LINES ON THE MAP SHOULD WE FOCUS ON WHAT I WANT TO PRESENT TO YOU IS WHAT I CALL
ParagKhanna_2009G@561.02:569.34 OIL USED TO BE ONE OF THE FORCES HOLDING IRAQ TOGETHER NOW IT IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF THE COUNTRY 'S DISINTEGRATION THE REASON IS KURDISTAN
ParagKhanna_2009G@569.55:580.03 THE KURDS FOR THREE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE BEEN WAGING A STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE AND NOW IS THEIR CHANCE TO FINALLY HAVE IT THESE ARE PIPELINE ROUTES WHICH EMERGE FROM KURDISTAN WHICH IS AN OIL RICH REGION
ParagKhanna_2009G@580.44:591.00 AND TODAY IF YOU GO TO KURDISTAN YOU'LL SEE THAT KURDISH PESHMERGA GUERILLAS ARE SQUARING OFF AGAINST THE SUNNI IRAQI ARMY BUT WHAT ARE THEY GUARDING IS IT REALLY A BORDER ON THE MAP
ParagKhanna_2009G@601.11:607.05 I DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD IRAQ WILL STILL BE THE SECOND LARGEST OIL PRODUCER IN THE WORLD BEHIND SAUDI ARABIA
ParagKhanna_2009G@607.63:614.54 AND WE'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO SOLVE A THREE THOUSAND YEAR OLD DISPUTE NOW REMEMBER KURDISTAN IS LANDLOCKED IT HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO BEHAVE
ParagKhanna_2009G@614.98:624.28 IN ORDER TO PROFIT FROM ITS OIL IT HAS TO EXPORT IT THROUGH TURKEY OR SYRIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES AND IRAQ ITSELF AND THEREFORE IT HAS TO HAVE AMICABLE RELATIONS WITH THEM
ParagKhanna_2009G@625.05:634.86 NOW LETS LOOK AT A PERENNIAL CONFLICT IN THE REGION THAT IS OF COURSE IN PALESTINE PALESTINE IS SOMETHING OF A CARTOGRAPHIC ANOMALY BECAUSE IT'S TWO PARTS PALESTINIAN
ParagKhanna_2009G@634.99:642.34 ONE PART ISRAEL THIRTY YEARS OF ROSE GARDEN DIPLOMACY HAVE NOT DELIVERED US PEACE IN THIS CONFLICT WHAT MIGHT
ParagKhanna_2009G@642.92:656.08 I BELIEVE THAT WHAT MIGHT SOLVE THE PROBLEM IS INFRASTRUCTURE TODAY DONORS ARE SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THIS THESE TWO ARROWS ARE AN ARC AN ARC OF COMMUTER RAILROADS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT LINK THE WEST BANK AND
ParagKhanna_2009G@656.47:664.28 GAZA IF GAZA CAN HAVE A FUNCTIONING PORT AND BE LINKED TO THE WEST BANK YOU CAN HAVE A VIABLE PALESTINIAN STATE PALESTINIAN ECONOMY
ParagKhanna_2009G@664.84:676.11 THAT I BELIEVE IS GOING TO BRING PEACE TO THIS PARTICULAR CONFLICT THE LESSON FROM KURDISTAN AND FROM PALESTINE IS THAT INDEPENDENCE ALONE WITHOUT INFRASTRUCTURE IS
ParagKhanna_2009G@677.84:690.15 NOW WHAT MIGHT THIS ENTIRE REGION LOOK LIKE IF IN FACT WE FOCUS ON OTHER LINES ON THE MAP BESIDES BORDERS WHEN THE INSECURITIES MIGHT ABATE THE LAST TIME THAT WAS THE CASE WAS ACTUALLY A CENTURY AGO DURING THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE
ParagKhanna_2009G@690.84:703.82 THIS IS THE HIJAZ RAILWAY THE HIJAZ RAILWAY RAN FROM ISTANBUL TO MEDINA VIA DAMASCUS IT EVEN HAD AN OFFSHOOT RUNNING TO HAIFA IN WHAT IS TODAY ISRAEL ON THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA BUT TODAY THE HIJAZ RAILWAY LIES IN TATTERS RUINS
ParagKhanna_2009G@704.11:714.16 IF WE WERE TO FOCUS ON RECONSTRUCTING THESE CURVY LINES ON THE MAP INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CROSS THE STRAIGHT LINES THE BORDERS I BELIEVE THE MIDDLE EAST WOULD BE A FAR MORE PEACEFUL REGION
ParagKhanna_2009G@714.70:730.43 NOW LET 'S LOOK AT ANOTHER PART OF THE WORLD THE FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS OF CENTRAL ASIA THE STANS THESE COUNTRIES BORDERS ORIGINATE FROM STALIN 'S DECREES HE PURPOSELY DID NOT WANT THESE COUNTRIES TO MAKE SENSE HE WANTED ETHNICITIES TO MINGLE IN WAYS THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO DIVIDE AND RULE
ParagKhanna_2009G@742.04:749.01 WELL THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY WE USED TO TALK ABOUT OIL AND THE WAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT NOW BEFORE IT WAS HOW DO WE CONTROL THEIR OIL
ParagKhanna_2009G@749.67:756.71 NOW IT'S THEIR OIL FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES AND I ASSURE YOU IT'S EVERY BIT AS IMPORTANT TO THEM AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO COLONIZERS AND IMPERIALISTS
ParagKhanna_2009G@757.39:766.08 HERE ARE JUST SOME OF THE PIPELINE PROJECTIONS AND POSSIBILITIES AND SCENARIOS AND ROUTES THAT ARE BEING MAPPED OUT FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DECADES A GREAT DEAL OF THEM
ParagKhanna_2009G@766.42:777.36 FOR A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD HAVING PIPELINES IS THE TICKET TO BECOMING PART OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND FOR HAVING SOME MEANING BESIDES THE BORDERS THAT THEY ARE NOT LOYAL TO THEMSELVES JUST TAKE AZERBAIJAN
ParagKhanna_2009G@784.84:792.94 IT HAS REBRANDED ITSELF AS THE FRONTIER OF THE WEST THEN THERE IS TURKMENISTAN WHICH MOST PEOPLE THINK OF AS A FROZEN BASKET CASE
ParagKhanna_2009G@793.35:803.66 BUT NOW IT'S CONTRIBUTING GAS ACROSS THE CASPIAN SEA TO PROVIDE FOR EUROPE AND EVEN A POTENTIALLY TURKMEN AFGHAN PAKISTAN INDIA PIPELINE AS WELL
ParagKhanna_2009G@822.34:832.15 MORE PIPELINES MEANS MORE SILK ROADS INSTEAD OF THE GREAT GAME THE GREAT GAME CONNOTES DOMINANCE OF ONE OVER THE OTHER SILK ROAD CONNOTES INDEPENDENCE
ParagKhanna_2009G@849.65:859.32 THE EUROPEAN UNION BEGAN AS JUST THE COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY OF SIX COUNTRIES AND THEIR MAIN PURPOSE WAS REALLY TO KEEP THE REHABILITATION OF GERMANY TO HAPPEN IN A PEACEFUL WAY
ParagKhanna_2009G@859.91:865.17 BUT THEN EVENTUALLY IT GREW INTO TWELVE COUNTRIES AND THOSE ARE THE TWELVE STARS ON THE EUROPEAN
ParagKhanna_2009G@865.86:876.03 THE E U ALSO BECAME A CURRENCY BLOCK AND IS NOW THE MOST POWERFUL TRADE BLOCK IN THE ENTIRE WORLD ON AVERAGE THE E U HAS GROWN BY ONE COUNTRY PER YEAR SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR
ParagKhanna_2009G@876.77:889.11 IN FACT MOST OF THAT HAPPENED ON JUST ONE DAY IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR FIFTEEN NEW COUNTRIES JOINED THE E U AND NOW YOU HAVE WHAT MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER A ZONE OF PEACE SPANNING TWENTY SEVEN COUNTRIES AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE
ParagKhanna_2009G@889.54:894.62 SO WHAT IS NEXT WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WELL IN LIGHT BLUE
ParagKhanna_2009G@907.49:920.30 THESE REGIONS AREN'T PART OF THE E U THEY ARE BECOMING PART OF ITS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE JUST TAKE THE BALKANS CROATIA SERBIA BOSNIA THEY'RE NOT MEMBERS OF THE E U YET BUT YOU CAN GET ON A GERMAN ICE TRAIN AND MAKE IT ALMOST
ParagKhanna_2009G@921.57:931.48 IN BOSNIA YOU USE THE EURO CURRENCY ALREADY AND THAT'S THE ONLY CURRENCY THEY'RE PROBABLY EVER GOING TO HAVE SO LOOKING AT OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE 'S PERIPHERY SUCH AS NORTH AFRICA
ParagKhanna_2009G@931.78:938.95 ON AVERAGE EVERY YEAR OR TWO A NEW OIL OR GAS PIPELINE OPENS UP UNDER THE MEDITERRANEAN CONNECTING NORTH AFRICA TO EUROPE
ParagKhanna_2009G@949.87:961.16 SO IN OTHER WORDS I BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENT SARKOZY OF FRANCE IS RIGHT WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT A MEDITERRANEAN UNION NOW LET 'S LOOK AT TURKEY AND THE CAUCASUS I MENTIONED AZERBAIJAN BEFORE
ParagKhanna_2009G@961.70:974.51 THAT CORRIDOR OF TURKEY AND THE CAUCASUS HAS BECOME THE CONDUIT FOR TWENTY PERCENT OF EUROPE 'S ENERGY SUPPLY SO DOES TURKEY REALLY HAVE TO BE A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION I DON'T THINK IT DOES I THINK IT'S ALREADY PART OF A EURO TURKISH SUPERPOWER
ParagKhanna_2009G@975.51:983.91 SO WHAT'S NEXT WHERE ARE WE GOING TO SEE BORDERS CHANGE AND NEW COUNTRIES BORN WELL SOUTH CENTRAL ASIA SOUTH WEST ASIA IS A VERY GOOD PLACE TO START
ParagKhanna_2009G@984.52:993.75 EIGHT YEARS AFTER THE U S INVADED AFGHANISTAN THERE IS STILL A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN ARE STILL SO FRAGILE THAT NEITHER OF THEM HAVE DEALT CONSTRUCTIVELY WITH
ParagKhanna_2009G@994.29:1003.31 PROBLEM OF PASHTUN NATIONALISM THIS IS THE FLAG THAT FLIES IN THE MINDS OF TWENTY MILLION PASHTUNS WHO LIVE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE THE AFGHAN AND PAKISTAN BORDER
ParagKhanna_2009G@1003.81:1014.17 LET 'S NOT NEGLECT THE INSURGENCY JUST TO THE SOUTH BALUCHISTAN TWO WEEKS AGO BALUCHI REBELS ATTACKED A PAKISTANI MILITARY GARRISON AND THIS WAS THE FLAG THAT THEY RAISED OVER IT
ParagKhanna_2009G@1014.48:1025.18 THE POST COLONIAL ENTROPY THAT IS HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD IS ACCELERATING AND I EXPECT MORE SUCH CHANGES TO OCCUR IN THE MAP AS THE STATES FRAGMENT OF COURSE WE CAN'T FORGET AFRICA
ParagKhanna_2009G@1025.73:1036.73 FIFTY THREE COUNTRIES AND BY FAR THE MOST NUMBER OF SUSPICIOUSLY STRAIGHT LINES ON THE MAP IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT ALL OF AFRICA WE COULD MOST CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE FAR MORE TRIBAL DIVISIONS
ParagKhanna_2009G@1037.18:1046.04 AND SO FORTH BUT LET 'S JUST LOOK AT SUDAN THE SECOND LARGEST COUNTRY IN AFRICA IT HAS THREE ONGOING CIVIL WARS THE GENOCIDE IN DARFUR WHICH YOU ALL KNOW ABOUT
ParagKhanna_2009G@1046.71:1059.33 THE CIVIL WAR IN THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY AND SOUTH SUDAN SOUTH SUDAN IS GOING TO BE HAVING A REFERENDUM IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN IN WHICH IT IS VERY LIKELY TO VOTE ITSELF INDEPENDENCE NOW LET 'S GO UP TO THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
ParagKhanna_2009G@1060.94:1068.10 A GREAT RACE ON FOR ENERGY RESOURCES UNDER THE ARCTIC SEABED WHO WILL WIN CANADA RUSSIA THE UNITED STATES ACTUALLY GREENLAND
ParagKhanna_2009G@1078.41:1086.62 WHAT IS THE LESSON FROM ALL OF THIS GEOPOLITICS IS A VERY UNSENTIMENTAL DISCIPLINE IT'S CONSTANTLY MORPHING AND CHANGING THE WORLD
ParagKhanna_2009G@1087.06:1095.35 LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE AND LIKE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ECOSYSTEM WE'RE ALWAYS SEARCHING FOR EQUILIBRIUM IN HOW WE DIVIDE OURSELVES ACROSS THE PLANET
ParagKhanna_2009G@1096.06:1101.88 NOW WE FEAR CHANGES ON THE MAP WE FEAR CIVIL WARS DEATH TOLLS HAVING TO LEARN THE NAMES OF NEW COUNTRIES
ParagKhanna_2009G@1102.46:1110.81 BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE INERTIA OF THE EXISTING BORDERS THAT WE HAVE TODAY IS FAR WORSE AND FAR MORE VIOLENT THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE CHANGE THOSE BORDERS AND WHAT LINES DO WE FOCUS ON
ParagKhanna_2009G@1111.49:1119.08 I BELIEVE WE FOCUS ON THE LINES THAT CROSS BORDERS THE INFRASTRUCTURE LINES THEN WE'LL WIND UP WITH THE WORLD WE WANT A BORDERLESS ONE THANK YOU
