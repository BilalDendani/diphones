LarryBrilliant_2007P@17.23:25.87 I'M GOING TO TRY TO GIVE YOU A VIEW OF THE WORLD AS I SEE IT THE PROBLEMS AND THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE FACE
LarryBrilliant_2007P@26.67:35.29 AND THEN ASK THE QUESTION IF WE SHOULD BE OPTIMISTIC OR PESSIMISTIC AND THEN I'LL LET YOU IN ON A SECRET WHICH IS WHY I AM AN INCURABLE OPTIMIST
LarryBrilliant_2007P@38.33:40.74 SHOWING YOU AN AL GORE MOVIE THAT YOU MAY HAVE SEEN BEFORE
LarryBrilliant_2007P@42.65:44.39 ALL SEEN INCONVENIENT
LarryBrilliant_2007P@45.49:47.21 TRUTH THIS IS A LITTLE MORE INCONVENIENT
LarryBrilliant_2007P@73.35:82.43 OUR ATMOSPHERE SEEMS TO BE GETTING WARMER THIS IS BAD WELL IT'S BEEN CALCULATED A FEW DEGREES RISE IN THE EARTH 'S TEMPERATURE WOULD MELT
LarryBrilliant_2007P@114.16:126.64 SHOULD WE FEEL GOOD OR SHOULD WE FEEL BAD THAT FIFTY YEARS OF FOREKNOWLEDGE ACCOMPLISHED SO LITTLE WELL IT DEPENDS REALLY ON WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE
LarryBrilliant_2007P@127.85:135.76 AND I THINK AS MY GOALS I ALWAYS GO BACK TO GANDHI 'S TALISMAN WHEN MAHATMA GANDHI WAS ASKED
LarryBrilliant_2007P@136.24:143.30 HOW DO YOU KNOW IF THE NEXT ACT THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO DO IS THE RIGHT ONE OR THE WRONG
LarryBrilliant_2007P@144.47:153.26 HE SAID CONSIDER THE FACE OF THE POOREST MOST VULNERABLE HUMAN BEING THAT YOU EVER CHANCED UPON
LarryBrilliant_2007P@166.29:173.71 FOR THOSE OF US IN THIS ROOM IT'S NOT JUST THE POOREST AND THE MOST VULNERABLE INDIVIDUAL IT'S THE COMMUNITY IT'S THE CULTURE
LarryBrilliant_2007P@174.41:183.76 IT'S THE WORLD ITSELF AND THE TRENDS FOR THOSE WHO ARE AT THE PERIPHERY OF OUR SOCIETY WHO ARE THE POOREST AND THE MOST VULNERABLE
LarryBrilliant_2007P@184.32:194.12 THE TRENDS GIVE RISE TO A GREAT CASE FOR PESSIMISM BUT THERE'S ALSO A WONDERFUL CASE FOR OPTIMISM LET 'S REVIEW THEM BOTH
LarryBrilliant_2007P@195.85:196.55 FIRST OF ALL
LarryBrilliant_2007P@198.98:213.22 THERE'S TWO DEGREES OR THREE DEGREES OF CLIMATE CHANGE BAKED INTO THE SYSTEM IT WILL CAUSE RISING SEAS IT WILL CAUSE SALINE DEPOSITED INTO WELLS AND INTO LANDS
LarryBrilliant_2007P@214.29:221.72 IT WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY HARM THE POOREST AND THE MOST VULNERABLE AS WILL THE INCREASING RISE OF POPULATION
LarryBrilliant_2007P@222.75:234.48 EVEN THOUGH WE'VE DODGED PAUL EHRLICH 'S POPULATION BOMB AND WE WILL NOT SEE TWENTY BILLION PEOPLE IN THIS DECADE AS HE HAD FORECAST WE EAT AS IF WE WERE TWENTY BILLION
LarryBrilliant_2007P@235.65:242.71 AND WE CONSUME SO MUCH THAT AGAIN A RISE OF SIX POINT FIVE BILLION TO NINE POINT
LarryBrilliant_2007P@243.20:252.77 FIVE BILLION IN OUR GRANDCHILDREN 'S LIFETIME WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY HURT THE POOREST AND THE MOST VULNERABLE THAT'S WHY
LarryBrilliant_2007P@253.89:255.52 THEY MIGRATE TO CITIES
LarryBrilliant_2007P@267.43:278.79 RURAL AREAS ARE NO LONGER PRODUCING AS MUCH FOOD AS THEY DID THE GREEN REVOLUTION NEVER REACHED AFRICA AND WITH DESERTIFICATION SANDSTORMS THE GOBI DESERT THE
LarryBrilliant_2007P@280.92:283.61 WE ARE FINDING INCREASING DIFFICULTY OF
LarryBrilliant_2007P@284.82:293.73 TO PRODUCE AS MANY CALORIES AS IT DID EVEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO SO HUMANS ARE TURNING MORE TOWARDS ANIMAL CONSUMPTION
LarryBrilliant_2007P@295.27:303.01 IN AFRICA LAST YEAR AFRICANS ATE SIX HUNDRED MILLION WILD ANIMALS AND CONSUMED TWO BILLION KILOGRAMS
LarryBrilliant_2007P@304.87:306.68 AND EVERY KILOGRAM OF BUSHMEAT
LarryBrilliant_2007P@307.86:312.94 CONTAINED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NOVEL VIRUSES THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN CHARTED
LarryBrilliant_2007P@313.88:316.20 THE GENOMIC SEQUENCES OF WHICH WE DON'T KNOW
LarryBrilliant_2007P@317.08:321.66 THEIR FITNESS FOR CREATING PANDEMICS WE ARE UNAWARE OF
LarryBrilliant_2007P@322.58:328.41 BUT WE ARE RIPE FOR ZOONOTIC BORNE EMERGING COMMUNICABLE DISEASES
LarryBrilliant_2007P@331.39:333.87 I WOULD SAY EXPLOSIVE GROWTH OF TECHNOLOGY
LarryBrilliant_2007P@334.70:337.56 MOST OF US ARE THE BENEFICIARIES OF THAT GROWTH
LarryBrilliant_2007P@338.71:341.20 BUT IT HAS A DARK SIDE IN
LarryBrilliant_2007P@342.92:352.83 AND IN TECHNOLOGY THAT PUTS US ON A COLLISION COURSE TO MAGNIFY ANY ANGER HATRED OR FEELING OF MARGINALIZATION
LarryBrilliant_2007P@354.24:361.71 AND IN FACT WITH INCREASING GLOBALIZATION FOR WHICH THERE ARE BIG WINNERS AND EVEN BIGGER LOSERS
LarryBrilliant_2007P@362.38:369.58 TODAY THE WORLD IS MORE DIVERSE AND UNFAIR THAN PERHAPS IT HAS EVER BEEN IN HISTORY
LarryBrilliant_2007P@370.46:377.26 ONE PERCENT OF US OWN FORTY PERCENT OF ALL THE GOODS AND SERVICES WHAT WILL
LarryBrilliant_2007P@379.08:385.79 THE BILLION PEOPLE TODAY WHO LIVE ON LESS THAN ONE DOLLAR A DAY RISE TO THREE BILLION
LarryBrilliant_2007P@386.77:388.54 IN THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS
LarryBrilliant_2007P@389.29:401.47 THE ONE PERCENT WILL OWN EVEN MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OF ALL THE WORLD 'S GOODS AND SERVICES NOT BECAUSE THEY'VE GROWN RICHER BUT BECAUSE THE REST OF THE WORLD HAS GROWN INCREASINGLY POORER
LarryBrilliant_2007P@413.16:421.09 THERE'S LOTS OF REASON FOR PESSIMISM DARFUR IS AT ITS ORIGIN A RESOURCE WAR
LarryBrilliant_2007P@422.62:434.57 LAST YEAR THERE WERE EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND RIOTS IN CHINA TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY A DAY THAT REQUIRED POLICE OR MILITARY INTERVENTION MOST OF THEM WERE ABOUT RESOURCES
LarryBrilliant_2007P@435.16:442.79 WE ARE FACING AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER SCALE OF DISASTERS SOME ARE WEATHER RELATED HUMAN RIGHTS RELATED
LarryBrilliant_2007P@451.27:457.37 A QUAINT FORERUNNER OF THINGS TO COME IT'S A DESTABILIZED WORLD
LarryBrilliant_2007P@459.09:467.08 AND UNLIKE DESTABILIZED WORLD IN THE PAST IT WILL BE BROADCAST TO YOU ON YOUTUBE YOU WILL SEE IT ON DIGITAL TELEVISION AND ON YOUR
LarryBrilliant_2007P@468.55:475.69 WHAT WILL THAT LEAD TO FOR SOME IT WILL LEAD TO ANGER RELIGIOUS AND SECTARIAN VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM
LarryBrilliant_2007P@477.33:479.53 FOR OTHERS WITHDRAWAL
LarryBrilliant_2007P@480.92:484.33 NIHILISM MATERIALISM
LarryBrilliant_2007P@497.45:511.36 WILL WE BECOME ENERGIZED LET 'S LOOK AT ONE CASE THE CASE OF BANGLADESH FIRST EVEN IF CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS STOPPED TODAY GLOBAL WARMING WOULD CONTINUE
LarryBrilliant_2007P@512.59:519.35 AND EVEN WITH GLOBAL WARMING IF YOU CAN SEE THESE BLUE LINES THE DOTTED LINE SHOWS
LarryBrilliant_2007P@520.06:520.64 EVEN IF
LarryBrilliant_2007P@523.39:531.79 OF GREENHOUSE GASSES STOPPED TODAY THE NEXT DECADES WILL SEE RISING SEA LEVELS A MINIMUM
LarryBrilliant_2007P@535.86:544.92 SEA LEVELS IS THE BEST CASE THAT WE CAN HOPE FOR AND IT COULD BE TEN TIMES THAT WHAT WILL THAT TO DO TO BANGLADESH LET 'S TAKE A LOOK
LarryBrilliant_2007P@548.29:549.42 SO HERE 'S BANGLADESH
LarryBrilliant_2007P@551.84:560.96 SEVENTY PERCENT OF BANGLADESH IS AT LESS THAN FIVE FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL LET 'S GO UP AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE HIMALAYAS
LarryBrilliant_2007P@561.53:573.96 AND WE'LL WATCH AS GLOBAL WARMING MAKES THEM MELT MORE WATER COMES DOWN THE DEFORESTED AREAS HERE IN THE TARAI WILL BE UNABLE TO ABSORB THE EFFLUENT BECAUSE TREES ARE LIKE STRAWS
LarryBrilliant_2007P@574.59:586.81 THAT SUCK UP THE EXTRA SEASONAL WATER NOW WE'RE LOOKING DOWN SOUTH THROUGH THE KALI GANDAKI MANY OF YOU I THINK HAVE PROBABLY TREKKED HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO CRUISE DOWN AND TAKE A LOOK
LarryBrilliant_2007P@596.99:607.05 AND IN THE SEAS RISING FROM THE SOUTH LOOKING AT THE FIVE MAJOR RIVERS THAT FEED BANGLADESH AND NOW LET 'S LOOK FROM THE SOUTH
LarryBrilliant_2007P@607.59:609.09 LOOKING UP AND LET 'S SEE THIS IN RELIEF
LarryBrilliant_2007P@618.80:624.50 FLOWS FROM THE HIMALAYAS AND TAKE A LOOK AT THIS
LarryBrilliant_2007P@626.63:633.51 AS MANY AS ONE HUNDRED MILLION REFUGEES FROM BANGLADESH COULD BE EXPECTED TO MIGRATE
LarryBrilliant_2007P@635.03:640.31 INTO INDIA AND INTO CHINA THIS IS
LarryBrilliant_2007P@640.58:644.57 THE DIFFICULTY THAT ONE COUNTRY FACES BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE
LarryBrilliant_2007P@645.72:651.68 ALL AROUND THE EARTH WHEREVER THERE IS LOW LYING AREA
LarryBrilliant_2007P@665.64:667.73 AREA WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER
LarryBrilliant_2007P@669.01:681.97 THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS FAR AWAY TO PEOPLE THAT WE DON'T KNOW GLOBAL WARMING IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS TO ALL OF US ALL AT ONCE AS ARE THESE NEWLY EMERGING COMMUNICABLE DISEASES
LarryBrilliant_2007P@697.03:705.96 TWENTY YEARS AGO NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF WEST NILE FEVER AND THEN WE WATCHED AS ONE CASE ARRIVED ON THE EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES AND IT MARCHED EVERY YEAR
LarryBrilliant_2007P@706.68:714.43 WESTWARDLY DO YOU REMEMBER NO ONE HAD HEARD OF EBOLA UNTIL WE HEARD OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE DYING IN CENTRAL AFRICA FROM IT
LarryBrilliant_2007P@715.51:722.10 IT'S JUST THE BEGINNING UNFORTUNATELY THERE HAVE BEEN THIRTY NOVEL EMERGING
LarryBrilliant_2007P@731.21:736.18 IT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH REASON FOR PESSIMISM BUT NOW LET 'S LOOK AT THE CASE FOR OPTIMISM
LarryBrilliant_2007P@739.98:747.72 OF THE BAD NEWS HUMAN BEINGS HAVE ALWAYS RISEN TO THE CHALLENGE YOU JUST NEED TO LOOK AT THE LIST OF NOBEL LAUREATES
LarryBrilliant_2007P@747.92:757.07 TO REMIND OURSELVES WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE PARALYZED BY FEAR PARALYZED INTO INACTION WHEN SOME
LarryBrilliant_2007P@757.78:766.33 PROBABLY ONE OF YOU IN THIS ROOM JUMPED INTO THE BREACH AND CREATED AN ORGANIZATION LIKE PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
LarryBrilliant_2007P@766.92:775.33 WHICH FOUGHT AGAINST THE NUCLEAR THREAT MEDICINS SANS FRONTIERES THAT RENEWED OUR COMMITMENT TO DISASTER RELIEF
LarryBrilliant_2007P@782.03:794.19 MUHAMMAD YUNUS WE'VE SEEN THE ERADICATION OF SMALLPOX WE MAY SEE THE ERADICATION OF POLIO THIS YEAR LAST YEAR THERE WERE ONLY TWO THOUSAND CASES IN THE WORLD
LarryBrilliant_2007P@794.66:808.42 WE MAY SEE THE ERADICATION OF GUINEA WORM NEXT YEAR THERE ARE ONLY THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CASES LEFT IN THE WORLD TWENTY YEARS AGO THERE WERE THREE AND A HALF MILLION AND WE'VE SEEN A NEW DISEASE NOT LIKE
LarryBrilliant_2007P@808.51:815.57 THE THIRTY NOVEL EMERGING COMMUNICABLE DISEASES THIS DISEASE IS CALLED SUDDEN WEALTH SYNDROME
LarryBrilliant_2007P@818.12:819.63 IT'S AN AMAZING PHENOMENON
LarryBrilliant_2007P@821.09:828.39 ALL THROUGHOUT THE TECHNOLOGY WORLD WE'RE SEEING YOUNG PEOPLE BITTEN BY THIS DISEASE OF SUDDEN WEALTH SYNDROME
LarryBrilliant_2007P@829.08:837.79 BUT THEY'RE USING THEIR WEALTH IN A WAY THAT THEIR FOREFATHERS NEVER DID THEY'RE NOT WAITING UNTIL THEY DIE TO CREATE FOUNDATIONS
LarryBrilliant_2007P@857.06:870.77 WE ALL FELT THAT WE WERE PART OF IT THAT A BETTER WORLD WAS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER THAT WE WERE WATCHING THE BIRTH OF A WORLD FREE OF HATRED AND VIOLENCE AND PREJUDICE TODAY THERE'S ANOTHER KIND OF MOVEMENT IT'S A MOVEMENT

LarryBrilliant_2007P@980.06:989.46 CONCERTS AND YOU CAN FEEL THIS OPTIMISTIC MOVE TO SAVE THE EARTH IN THE AIR NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND
LarryBrilliant_2007P@990.66:1000.05 THAT GLOBAL WARMING HURTS THE POOREST AND THE WEAKEST THE MOST THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING THE FIRST STEP WHICH IS ACTING OUT OF THEIR OWN SELF INTEREST

LarryBrilliant_2007P@1138.31:1149.55 WHEN WE HAD ALMOST ERADICATED SMALLPOX IT CAME BACK AGAIN BECAUSE THE COMPANY TOWN OF TATANAGAR DREW LABORERS WHO COULD COME THERE AND GET EMPLOYMENT
