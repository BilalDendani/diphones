GeverTulley_2009@13.86:19.20 THIS IS THE EXACT MOMENT THAT I STARTED CREATING SOMETHING CALLED TINKERING SCHOOL
GeverTulley_2009@29.78:35.61 AND BE TRUSTED TRUSTED NOT TO HURT THEMSELVES AND TRUSTED NOT TO HURT OTHERS
GeverTulley_2009@46.83:53.94 WHEN THE KIDS ARRIVE THEY'RE CONFRONTED WITH LOTS OF STUFF WOOD AND NAILS AND ROPE AND
GeverTulley_2009@55.46:58.20 AND LOTS OF TOOLS REAL TOOLS
GeverTulley_2009@60.65:74.07 IT'S A SIX DAY IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE FOR THE KIDS AND WITHIN THAT CONTEXT WE CAN OFFER THE KIDS TIME SOMETHING THAT SEEMS IN SHORT SUPPLY IN THEIR OVER SCHEDULED LIVES
GeverTulley_2009@75.84:77.04 OUR GOAL
GeverTulley_2009@77.40:89.11 IS TO ENSURE THAT THEY LEAVE WITH A BETTER SENSE OF HOW TO MAKE THINGS THAN WHEN THEY ARRIVED AND THE DEEP INTERNAL REALIZATION THAT YOU CAN FIGURE THINGS OUT BY FOOLING AROUND
GeverTulley_2009@90.83:94.82 NOTHING EVER TURNS OUT AS PLANNED EVER
GeverTulley_2009@98.10:101.98 AND THE KIDS SOON LEARN THAT ALL PROJECTS GO AWRY
GeverTulley_2009@104.30:111.13 AND BECOME AT EASE WITH THE IDEA THAT EVERY STEP IN A PROJECT IS A STEP CLOSER TO SWEET SUCCESS
GeverTulley_2009@112.32:114.00 OR GLEEFUL CALAMITY
GeverTulley_2009@116.65:125.92 WE START FROM DOODLES AND SKETCHES AND SOMETIMES WE MAKE REAL PLANS AND SOMETIMES WE JUST START BUILDING
GeverTulley_2009@127.25:136.56 BUILDING IS AT THE HEART OF THE EXPERIENCE HANDS ON DEEPLY IMMERSED AND FULLY COMMITTED TO THE PROBLEM AT HAND
GeverTulley_2009@146.84:157.65 IS IN THE DOING AND FAILURES ARE CELEBRATED AND ANALYZED PROBLEMS BECOME PUZZLES AND OBSTACLES DISAPPEAR
GeverTulley_2009@158.86:167.84 WHEN FACED WITH PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT SETBACKS OR COMPLEXITIES A REALLY INTERESTING BEHAVIOR EMERGES DECORATION
GeverTulley_2009@176.90:178.11 FROM THESE INTERLUDES COME
GeverTulley_2009@179.05:185.76 DEEP INSIGHTS AND AMAZING NEW APPROACHES TO SOLVING THE PROBLEMS THAT HAD THEM FRUSTRATED JUST MOMENTS BEFORE
GeverTulley_2009@188.08:190.12 ALL MATERIALS
GeverTulley_2009@190.93:198.27 ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE EVEN THOSE MUNDANE HATEFUL PLASTIC GROCERY BAGS
GeverTulley_2009@198.54:205.77 CAN BECOME A BRIDGE STRONGER THAN ANYONE IMAGINED AND THE THINGS THAT THEY BUILD
GeverTulley_2009@207.63:209.46 EVEN THEMSELVES
GeverTulley_2009@210.85:211.74 THREE
