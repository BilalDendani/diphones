EliBeer_2013P@31.55:40.49 WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THESE PICTURES IT BROUGHT ME BACK MANY YEARS TO MY PAST WHEN I WAS A CHILD I GREW UP IN A SMALL NEIGHBORHOOD IN JERUSALEM
EliBeer_2013P@40.87:43.76 WHEN I WAS SIX YEARS OLD
EliBeer_2013P@43.84:46.99 I WAS WALKING BACK FROM SCHOOL ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON
EliBeer_2013P@47.21:54.41 WITH MY OLDER BROTHER WE WERE PASSING BY A BUS STOP WE SAW A BUS BLOW UP IN FRONT OF OUR EYES
EliBeer_2013P@54.48:57.42 THE BUS WAS ON FIRE
EliBeer_2013P@57.49:59.52 AND MANY PEOPLE WERE HURT AND KILLED
EliBeer_2013P@68.36:70.69 WE WERE SO SCARED AND WE JUST RAN AWAY
EliBeer_2013P@70.77:78.22 GROWING UP I DECIDED I WANTED TO BECOME A DOCTOR AND SAVE LIVES MAYBE THAT WAS BECAUSE OF WHAT I SAW WHEN I WAS A CHILD
EliBeer_2013P@78.7:81.87 WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN I TOOK AN EMT COURSE
EliBeer_2013P@81.89:84.7 AND I WENT TO VOLUNTEER ON AN AMBULANCE
EliBeer_2013P@85.01:90.17 FOR TWO YEARS I VOLUNTEERED ON AN AMBULANCE IN JERUSALEM I HELPED MANY PEOPLE
EliBeer_2013P@90.43:93.11 BUT WHENEVER SOMEONE REALLY NEEDED HELP
EliBeer_2013P@93.21:100.4 I NEVER GOT THERE IN TIME WE NEVER GOT THERE THE TRAFFIC IS SO BAD THE DISTANCE AND EVERYTHING WE NEVER GOT THERE WHEN SOMEBODY REALLY NEEDED US
EliBeer_2013P@100.9:105.04 ONE DAY WE RECEIVED A CALL ABOUT A SEVEN YEAR OLD CHILD CHOKING FROM A HOT DOG
EliBeer_2013P@105.35:108.76 TRAFFIC WAS HORRIFIC AND WE WERE COMING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN
EliBeer_2013P@108.76:110.71 IN THE NORTH PART OF JERUSALEM
EliBeer_2013P@111.12:115.69 WHEN WE GOT THERE TWENTY MINUTES LATER WE STARTED CPR ON THE KID
EliBeer_2013P@115.84:118.31 A DOCTOR COMES IN FROM A BLOCK AWAY
EliBeer_2013P@118.94:127.13 STOP US CHECKS THE KID AND TELLS US TO STOP CPR THAT SECOND HE DECLARED THIS CHILD DEAD
EliBeer_2013P@127.17:130.64 AT THAT MOMENT I UNDERSTOOD
EliBeer_2013P@131.1:133.57 THAT THIS CHILD DIED FOR NOTHING
EliBeer_2013P@133.69:137.05 IF THIS DOCTOR WHO LIVED ONE
EliBeer_2013P@166.02:182.79 SO I WENT OVER TO THE MANAGER OF THE AMBULANCE COMPANY AND I TOLD HIM PLEASE WHENEVER YOU HAVE A CALL COMING INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WE HAVE FIFTEEN GREAT GUYS WHO ARE WILLING TO STOP EVERYTHING THEY 'RE DOING AND RUN AND SAVE LIVES JUST ALERT US BY BEEPER WE 'LL BUY THESE BEEPERS JUST TELL YOUR DISPATCH TO SEND US THE BEEPER
EliBeer_2013P@182.79:184.32 AND WE WILL RUN AND SAVE LIVES
EliBeer_2013P@241.68:251.09 AND WE DID TURNS WHO 'S GOING TO LISTEN TO THE RADIO SCANNERS THE NEXT DAY WHILE I WAS LISTENING TO THE SCANNERS I HEARD ABOUT A CALL COMING IN OF A SEVENTY YEAR OLD MAN
EliBeer_2013P@251.49:256.8 HURT BY A CAR ONLY ONE BLOCK AWAY FROM ME ON THE MAIN STREET OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD
EliBeer_2013P@257.22:270.36 I RAN THERE BY FOOT I HAD NO MEDICAL EQUIPMENT WHEN I GOT THERE THE SEVENTY YEAR OLD MAN WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR BLOOD WAS GUSHING OUT OF HIS NECK HE WAS ON COUMADIN I KNEW I HAD TO STOP HIS BLEEDING OR ELSE HE WOULD DIE
EliBeer_2013P@270.51:278.84 I TOOK OFF MY YARMULKE BECAUSE I HAD NO MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND WITH A LOT OF PRESSURE I STOPPED HIS BLEEDING HE WAS BLEEDING FROM HIS NECK
EliBeer_2013P@279:280.6 WHEN THE AMBULANCE ARRIVED
EliBeer_2013P@280.98:284.4 FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER I GAVE THEM OVER A PATIENT WHO WAS ALIVE
EliBeer_2013P@293.33:299.98 WHEN I WENT TO VISIT HIM TWO DAYS LATER HE GAVE ME A HUG AND WAS CRYING AND THANKING ME FOR SAVING HIS LIFE
EliBeer_2013P@300.6:308.95 AT THAT MOMENT WHEN I REALIZED THIS IS THE FIRST PERSON I EVER SAVED IN MY LIFE AFTER TWO YEARS VOLUNTEERING IN AN AMBULANCE I KNEW THIS IS MY LIFE 'S MISSION
EliBeer_2013P@309.71:314.08 SO TODAY TWENTY TWO YEARS LATER WE HAVE UNITED HATZALAH
EliBeer_2013P@329.16:337.08 PASSIONATE ABOUT SAVING LIVES AND THEY 'RE SPREAD ALL AROUND SO WHENEVER A CALL COMES IN THEY JUST STOP EVERYTHING AND GO AND RUN AND SAVE A LIFE
EliBeer_2013P@337.32:343.78 OUR AVERAGE RESPONSE TIME TODAY WENT DOWN TO LESS THAN THREE MINUTES IN ISRAEL
EliBeer_2013P@351.49:363.24 GOD FORBID BOMB ATTACKS SHOOTINGS WHATEVER IT IS EVEN A WOMAN THREE O 'CLOCK IN THE MORNING FALLING IN HER HOME AND NEEDS SOMEONE TO HELP HER THREE MINUTES WE 'LL HAVE A GUY WITH HIS PAJAMAS RUNNING TO HER HOUSE AND HELPING HER GET UP
EliBeer_2013P@364.35:373.8 THE REASONS WHY WE 'RE SO SUCCESSFUL ARE BECAUSE OF THREE THINGS THOUSANDS OF PASSIONATE VOLUNTEERS WHO WILL LEAVE EVERYTHING THEY DO AND RUN TO HELP PEOPLE THEY DON 'T EVEN KNOW
EliBeer_2013P@383.51:387.1 AND WE SAVE PEOPLE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE SAVED
EliBeer_2013P@389.32:397.88 THE SECOND REASON IS BECAUSE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW ISRAELIS ARE GOOD IN TECHNOLOGY EVERY ONE OF US HAS ON HIS PHONE NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF PHONE
EliBeer_2013P@414.78:423.81 AND THE THIRD THING ARE THESE AMBUCYCLES THESE AMBUCYCLES ARE AN AMBULANCE ON TWO WHEELS WE DON 'T TRANSFER PEOPLE BUT WE STABILIZE THEM AND WE SAVE THEIR LIVES
EliBeer_2013P@423.81:438.23 THEY NEVER GET STUCK IN TRAFFIC THEY COULD EVEN GO ON A SIDEWALK THEY NEVER LITERALLY GET STUCK IN TRAFFIC THAT 'S WHY WE GET THERE SO FAST A FEW YEARS AFTER I STARTED THIS ORGANIZATION IN A JEWISH COMMUNITY TWO MUSLIMS FROM EAST JERUSALEM CALLED ME UP
EliBeer_2013P@456.86:469.7 I SAID TO MYSELF I SAW SO MUCH TRAGEDY SO MUCH HATE AND IT 'S NOT ABOUT SAVING JEWS IT 'S NOT ABOUT SAVING MUSLIMS IT 'S NOT ABOUT SAVING CHRISTIANS IT 'S ABOUT SAVING PEOPLE SO I WENT AHEAD FULL FORCE
EliBeer_2013P@490.38:509.81 ARABS AND JEWS THEY DON 'T ALWAYS GET ALONG TOGETHER BUT HERE IN THIS SITUATION THE COMMUNITIES LITERALLY IT 'S AN UNBELIEVABLE SITUATION THAT HAPPENED THE DIVERSITIES ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY HAD A COMMON INTEREST LET 'S SAVE LIVES TOGETHER SETTLERS WERE SAVING ARABS AND ARABS WERE SAVING SETTLERS IT 'S AN UNBELIEVABLE CONCEPT THAT COULD WORK ONLY WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH A GREAT CAUSE
EliBeer_2013P@509.81:515.22 AND THESE ARE ALL VOLUNTEERS NO ONE IS GETTING MONEY THEY 'RE ALL DOING IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAVING LIVES
EliBeer_2013P@515.71:526.03 WHEN MY OWN FATHER COLLAPSED A FEW YEARS AGO FROM A CARDIAC ARREST ONE OF THE FIRST VOLUNTEERS TO ARRIVE TO SAVE MY FATHER WAS ONE OF THESE MUSLIM VOLUNTEERS FROM EAST JERUSALEM WHO
EliBeer_2013P@526.26:528.89 WAS IN THE FIRST COURSE TO JOIN HATZALAH
EliBeer_2013P@529.24:532.7 AND HE SAVED MY FATHER COULD YOU IMAGINE HOW I FELT IN THAT MOMENT
EliBeer_2013P@534.19:546.76 WHEN I STARTED THIS ORGANIZATION I WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD I NEVER IMAGINED THAT ONE DAY I 'D BE SPEAKING AT TEDMED I NEVER EVEN KNEW WHAT TEDMED WAS THEN I DON 'T THINK IT EXISTED BUT I NEVER IMAGINED
EliBeer_2013P@546.76:554.32 I NEVER IMAGINED THAT IT 'S GOING TO GO ALL AROUND IT 'S GOING TO SPREAD AROUND AND THIS LAST YEAR WE STARTED IN PANAMA AND BRAZIL ALL I NEED
EliBeer_2013P@554.32:556.67 IS A PARTNER WHO IS A LITTLE MESHUGENAH LIKE ME
EliBeer_2013P@556.67:559.42 PASSIONATE ABOUT SAVING LIVES AND WILLING TO DO IT
EliBeer_2013P@560.12:566.12 AND I 'M ACTUALLY STARTING IT IN INDIA VERY SOON WITH A FRIEND WHO I MET IN HARVARD JUST A WHILE BACK
EliBeer_2013P@575.85:582.41 EVEN AUSTRALIA AND MEXICO AND MANY OTHER JEWISH COMMUNITIES BUT IT COULD SPREAD EVERYWHERE IT 'S VERY EASY TO ADOPT
EliBeer_2013P@597.09:603.19 AND WE MADE A DIFFERENCE I GUESS YOU COULD CALL THIS A LIFESAVING FLASH MOB AND IT WORKS
EliBeer_2013P@604.05:605.79 WHEN I LOOK ALL AROUND HERE
EliBeer_2013P@606.24:608.24 I SEE LOTS OF PEOPLE
EliBeer_2013P@608.47:612.46 WHO WOULD GO AN EXTRA MILE RUN AN EXTRA MILE TO SAVE OTHER PEOPLE
EliBeer_2013P@612.68:619.98 NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE NO MATTER WHAT RELIGION NO MATTER WHO WHERE THEY COME FROM WE ALL WANT TO BE HEROES
EliBeer_2013P@620.19:621.92 WE JUST NEED A GOOD IDEA
