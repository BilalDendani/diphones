AlexSteffen_2005G SO JUST BEAR WITH ME WE 'LL GO REAL FAST YOU KNOW FILL IN THE BLANKS SO YOU KNOW SUSTAINABILITY SMALL PLANET RIGHT PICTURE A LITTLE EARTH CIRCLING AROUND THE SUN YOU KNOW ABOUT A MILLION YEARS AGO A BUNCH OF MONKEYS FELL OUT OF TREES GOT A LITTLE CLEVER HARNESSED FIRE INVENTED THE PRINTING PRESS MADE YOU KNOW LUGGAGE WITH WHEELS ON IT
AlexSteffen_2005G AND YOU KNOW BUILT THE SOCIETY THAT WE NOW LIVE IN
AlexSteffen_2005G UNFORTUNATELY WHILE THIS SOCIETY IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST PROSPEROUS AND DYNAMIC THE WORLD HAS EVER CREATED IT 'S GOT SOME MAJOR MAJOR FLAWS ONE OF THEM IS THAT EVERY SOCIETY HAS AN ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT IT HAS AN AMOUNT OF IMPACT
AlexSteffen_2005G HOW MUCH WASTE IS LEFT BEHIND YOU AND WE AT THE MOMENT IN OUR SOCIETY HAVE A REALLY DRAMATICALLY UNSUSTAINABLE LEVEL OF THIS WE 'RE USING UP ABOUT FIVE PLANETS
AlexSteffen_2005G IF EVERYBODY ON THE PLANET LIVED THE WAY WE DID WE 'D NEED BETWEEN FIVE SIX SEVEN SOME PEOPLE EVEN SAY TEN PLANETS TO MAKE IT CLEARLY WE DON 'T HAVE TEN PLANETS AGAIN YOU KNOW MENTAL VISUAL TEN PLANETS ONE PLANET TEN PLANETS ONE
AlexSteffen_2005G WE DON 'T HAVE THAT SO THAT 'S ONE PROBLEM THE SECOND PROBLEM IS THAT THE PLANET THAT WE HAVE IS BEING USED IN WILDLY UNFAIR WAYS
AlexSteffen_2005G THIS IS PRODUCING ALL SORTS OF TENSIONS ALL SORTS OF DYNAMICS THAT ARE DEEPLY DISTURBING
AlexSteffen_2005G AND THERE 'S MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ON THE WAY RIGHT SO THIS IS WHAT
AlexSteffen_2005G AND THOSE KIDS ARE GROWING UP IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY THAN THEIR PARENTS DID NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE THEY 'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO THIS IDEA OF OUR SOCIETY OF OUR PROSPERITY
AlexSteffen_2005G AND THEY MAY NOT WANT TO LIVE EXACTLY LIKE US THEY MAY NOT WANT TO BE AMERICANS OR BRITS OR GERMANS OR SOUTH AFRICANS BUT THEY WANT THEIR OWN VERSION OF A LIFE WHICH IS MORE PROSPEROUS AND MORE DYNAMIC AND MORE YOU KNOW ENJOYABLE AND ALL OF THESE THINGS COMBINE TO CREATE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TORQUE ON THE PLANET
AlexSteffen_2005G AND IF WE CANNOT FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT TORQUE
AlexSteffen_2005G WE ARE GOING TO FIND OURSELVES MORE AND MORE AND MORE QUICKLY
AlexSteffen_2005G FACING SITUATIONS WHICH ARE SIMPLY UNTHINKABLE EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM HAS HEARD THE WORST CASE SCENARIOS I DON 'T NEED TO GO INTO THAT BUT I WILL ASK THE QUESTION WHAT 'S THE ALTERNATIVE
AlexSteffen_2005G AND I WOULD SAY THAT AT THE MOMENT THE ALTERNATIVE IS UNIMAGINABLE
AlexSteffen_2005G YOU KNOW SO ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE THE UNTHINKABLE ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE THE UNIMAGINABLE WE DON 'T KNOW YET HOW TO BUILD A SOCIETY WHICH IS ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE WHICH IS SHAREABLE WITH EVERYBODY ON THE PLANET
AlexSteffen_2005G WHICH PROMOTES STABILITY AND DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND WHICH IS ACHIEVABLE IN THE TIME FRAME NECESSARY TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE CHALLENGES WE FACE WE DON 'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS YET SO WHAT 'S WORLDCHANGING WELL WORLDCHANGING
AlexSteffen_2005G YOU MIGHT THINK OF AS BEING A BIT OF A NEWS SERVICE FOR THE UNIMAGINABLE FUTURE
AlexSteffen_2005G YOU KNOW WHAT WE 'RE OUT THERE DOING IS LOOKING FOR EXAMPLES OF TOOLS MODELS AND IDEAS WHICH IF WIDELY ADOPTED WOULD CHANGE THE GAME
AlexSteffen_2005G SO I THOUGHT TODAY I 'D DO SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND TALK ABOUT WHAT WE 'RE LOOKING FOR RATHER THAN SAYING YOU KNOW RATHER THAN GIVING YOU TRIED AND TRUE EXAMPLES TALK ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS WE 'RE SCOPING OUT GIVE YOU A LITTLE PEEK INTO OUR EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK
AlexSteffen_2005G AND GIVEN THAT I HAVE THIRTEEN MINUTES TO DO THIS THIS IS GOING TO GO KIND OF QUICK SO I DON 'T KNOW JUST STICK WITH ME RIGHT SO FIRST OF ALL WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR BRIGHT GREEN CITY
AlexSteffen_2005G ONE OF THE BIGGEST LEVERS THAT WE HAVE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD FOR CHANGING THE IMPACT THAT WE HAVE ON THE PLANET IS CHANGING THE WAY THAT WE LIVE IN CITIES WE 'RE ALREADY AN URBAN PLANET THAT 'S ESPECIALLY TRUE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD AND PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN CITIES IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD TEND TO BE VERY PROSPEROUS AND THUS USE A LOT OF STUFF IF WE CAN CHANGE THE DYNAMIC
AlexSteffen_2005G BY FIRST OF ALL CREATING CITIES THAT ARE DENSER AND MORE LIVABLE HERE FOR EXAMPLE IS VANCOUVER WHICH IF YOU HAVEN 'T BEEN THERE YOU OUGHT TO GO FOR A VISIT IT 'S A FABULOUS CITY AND THEY ARE DOING DENSITY NEW DENSITY BETTER THAN PROBABLY ANYBODY ELSE ON THE PLANET RIGHT NOW THEY 'RE ACTUALLY MANAGING TO TALK NORTH AMERICANS OUT OF DRIVING CARS WHICH IS A PRETTY GREAT THING
AlexSteffen_2005G SO YOU HAVE DENSITY YOU ALSO HAVE GROWTH MANAGEMENT YOU LEAVE ASIDE WHAT IS NATURAL TO BE NATURAL THIS IS IN PORTLAND THAT IS AN ACTUAL DEVELOPMENT THAT LAND THERE WILL REMAIN PASTURE IN PERPETUITY THEY 'VE BOUNDED THE CITY WITH A LINE
AlexSteffen_2005G NATURE CITY NOTHING CHANGES
AlexSteffen_2005G YOU CAN ALSO START TO CHANGE WHAT YOU BUILD THIS IS THE BEDDINGTON ZERO ENERGY DEVELOPMENT IN LONDON WHICH IS ONE OF THE GREENEST BUILDINGS IN THE WORLD IT 'S A FABULOUS PLACE WE 'RE ABLE TO NOW BUILD BUILDINGS THAT GENERATE ALL THEIR OWN ELECTRICITY THAT RECYCLE MUCH OF THEIR WATER
AlexSteffen_2005G THAT ARE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE THAN STANDARD BUILDINGS USE ALL NATURAL LIGHT ETC AND OVER TIME COST LESS
AlexSteffen_2005G GREEN ROOFS BILL MCDONOUGH COVERED THAT LAST NIGHT SO I WON 'T DWELL ON THAT TOO MUCH
AlexSteffen_2005G BUT ONCE YOU ALSO HAVE PEOPLE LIVING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER
AlexSteffen_2005G ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO IS AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOP YOU CAN START TO HAVE SMART PLACES YOU CAN START TO KNOW WHERE THINGS ARE WHEN YOU KNOW WHERE THINGS ARE IT BECOMES EASIER TO SHARE THEM WHEN YOU SHARE THEM
AlexSteffen_2005G YOU END UP USING LESS SO ONE GREAT EXAMPLE IS CAR SHARE CLUBS WHICH ARE REALLY STARTING TO TAKE OFF IN THE U S HAVE ALREADY TAKEN OFF IN MANY PLACES IN EUROPE AND ARE A GREAT EXAMPLE IF YOU 'RE SOMEBODY WHO DRIVES YOU KNOW ONE DAY A WEEK DO YOU REALLY NEED YOUR OWN CAR
AlexSteffen_2005G ALTHOUGH I THINK IT OUGHT TO WORK THE OTHER WAY AROUND THAT IT GETS BRIGHTER THE MORE YOU DON 'T USE BUT YOU KNOW THERE MAY EVEN BE A SIMPLER APPROACH WE COULD JUST RE LABEL THINGS THIS LIGHT SWITCH THAT READS ON THE ONE HAND FLASHFLOODS AND ON THE OTHER HAND OFF
AlexSteffen_2005G HOW WE BUILD THINGS CAN CHANGE AS WELL THIS IS A BIO MORPHIC BUILDING IT TAKES ITS INSPIRATION IN FORM FROM LIFE MANY OF THESE BUILDINGS ARE INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL AND ALSO
AlexSteffen_2005G MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF BIO MIMICRY WHICH IS SOMETHING WE 'RE REALLY STARTING TO LOOK A LOT MORE FOR IN THIS CASE YOU HAVE A SHELL DESIGN WHICH WAS USED
AlexSteffen_2005G TO CREATE A NEW KIND OF EXHAUST FAN WHICH IS GREATLY MORE EFFECTIVE THERE 'S A LOT OF THIS STUFF HAPPENING IT 'S REALLY PRETTY REMARKABLE I ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK ON WORLDCHANGING IF YOU 'RE INTO IT WE 'RE STARTING TO COVER THIS MORE AND MORE THERE 'S ALSO NEO BIOLOGICAL
AlexSteffen_2005G DESIGN WHERE MORE AND MORE WE 'RE ACTUALLY USING LIFE ITSELF AND THE PROCESSES OF LIFE TO BECOME PART OF OUR INDUSTRY SO THIS FOR EXAMPLE IS HYDROGEN GENERATING ALGAE
AlexSteffen_2005G SO WE HAVE A MODEL IN POTENTIAL AN EMERGING MODEL THAT WE 'RE LOOKING FOR OF HOW TO TAKE THE CITIES MOST OF US LIVE IN AND TURN THEM INTO BRIGHT GREEN CITIES BUT UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THE PEOPLE ON THE PLANET DON 'T LIVE IN THE CITES WE LIVE IN THEY LIVE IN THE EMERGING MEGACITIES OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD
AlexSteffen_2005G AND THERE 'S A STATISTIC I OFTEN LIKE TO USE WHICH IS THAT WE 'RE ADDING A CITY OF SEATTLE EVERY FOUR DAYS A CITY THE SIZE OF SEATTLE TO THE PLANET EVERY FOUR DAYS I WAS GIVING A TALK ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO AND THIS GUY WHO 'D DONE SOME WORK WITH THE U N CAME UP TO ME AND WAS REALLY FLUSTERED AND HE SAID LOOK YOU 'VE GOT THAT TOTALLY WRONG IT 'S TOTALLY WRONG IT 'S EVERY SEVEN DAYS
AlexSteffen_2005G SO WE 'RE ADDING A CITY THE SIZE OF SEATTLE EVERY SEVEN DAYS AND MOST OF THOSE CITIES LOOK MORE LIKE THIS THAN THE CITY THAT YOU OR I LIVE IN MOST OF THOSE CITES ARE GROWING INCREDIBLY QUICKLY THEY DON 'T HAVE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE THEY HAVE ENORMOUS NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH POVERTY
AlexSteffen_2005G MAKE DEVELOPING NATION MEGACITIES INTO BRIGHT GREEN MEGACITIES WELL THE FIRST THING WE NEED IS WE NEED LEAPFROGGING AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR EVERYWHERE THE IDEA BEHIND LEAPFROGGING IS THAT IF YOU ARE A PERSON OR A COUNTRY WHO IS STUCK IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU DON 'T HAVE THE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT YOU NEED
AlexSteffen_2005G THERE 'S NO REASON FOR YOU TO INVEST IN LAST GENERATION 'S TECHNOLOGIES
AlexSteffen_2005G RIGHT THAT YOU 'RE MUCH BETTER OFF ALMOST UNIVERSALLY LOOKING FOR A LOW COST OR LOCALLY APPLICABLE VERSION OF THE NEWEST TECHNOLOGY ONE PLACE WE 'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH SEEING THIS IS WITH CELL PHONES
AlexSteffen_2005G WHAT IS TRUE FOR CELL PHONES IS TRUE FOR ALL SORTS OF TECHNOLOGIES THE SECOND THING IS TOOLS FOR COLLABORATION BE THEY SYSTEMS OF COLLABORATION OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SYSTEMS WHICH ENCOURAGE COLLABORATION RIGHT WHEN YOU HAVE
AlexSteffen_2005G THIS IS A PRETTY REMARKABLE PROGRAM USING FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE CHEAP SORT OF HACKED TOGETHER MACHINES AND BASICALLY SORT OF ABANDONED BUILDINGS HAS PUT TOGETHER A BUNCH OF COMMUNITY CENTERS WHERE PEOPLE CAN COME IN GET HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS LEARN COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SKILLS
AlexSteffen_2005G CULTURAL EXPLOSION AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE 'RE REALLY REALLY INTERESTED IN AT WORLDCHANGING IS THE WAYS IN WHICH THE SOUTH IS
AlexSteffen_2005G RE IDENTIFYING ITSELF AND RE CATEGORIZING ITSELF IN WAYS THAT HAVE LESS AND LESS TO DO WITH MOST OF US IN THIS ROOM SO IT 'S NOT YOU KNOW BOLLYWOOD ISN 'T JUST ANSWERING HOLLYWOOD RIGHT YOU KNOW BRAZILIAN MUSIC SCENE ISN 'T JUST ANSWERING THE MAJOR LABELS IT 'S DOING SOMETHING NEW THERE 'S NEW THINGS HAPPENING THERE 'S INTERPLAY BETWEEN THEM
AlexSteffen_2005G AND YOU KNOW YOU GET AMAZING THINGS LIKE I DON 'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE CITY OF GOD YEAH IT 'S A FABULOUS MOVIE IF YOU HAVEN 'T SEEN IT AND IT 'S ALL ABOUT THIS QUESTION IN A VERY ARTISTIC AND INDIRECT KIND OF WAY YOU HAVE OTHER RADICAL EXAMPLES WHERE THE ABILITY TO USE CULTURAL TOOLS IS SPREADING OUT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE JUST BEEN VISITED BY THE INTERNET BOOKMOBILE IN UGANDA
AlexSteffen_2005G AND WHO ARE WAVING THEIR FIRST BOOKS IN THE AIR WHICH I JUST THINK THAT 'S A PRETTY COOL PICTURE YOU KNOW
AlexSteffen_2005G SO YOU ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO START COMING TOGETHER AND ACTING ON THEIR OWN BEHALF IN POLITICAL AND CIVIC WAYS IN WAYS THAT HAVEN 'T HAPPENED BEFORE AND AS WE HEARD LAST NIGHT AS WE 'VE HEARD EARLIER THIS WEEK
AlexSteffen_2005G ARE ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTALLY VITAL
AlexSteffen_2005G TO THE ABILITY TO CRAFT NEW SOLUTIONS IS WE 'VE GOT TO CRAFT NEW POLITICAL REALITIES AND I WOULD PERSONALLY SAY THAT WE HAVE TO CRAFT NEW POLITICAL REALITIES NOT ONLY IN PLACES LIKE INDIA AFGHANISTAN KENYA PAKISTAN WHAT HAVE YOU BUT HERE AT HOME AS WELL ANOTHER WORLD IS POSSIBLE AND SORT OF THE BIG
AlexSteffen_2005G MOTTO OF THE ANTI GLOBALIZATION MOVEMENT RIGHT WE TWEAK THAT A LOT WE TALK ABOUT HOW ANOTHER WORLD ISN 'T JUST POSSIBLE ANOTHER WORLD 'S HERE THAT IT 'S NOT JUST THAT WE HAVE TO SORT OF IMAGINE THERE BEING A DIFFERENT VAGUE POSSIBILITY OUT THERE BUT WE NEED TO START ACTING A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT POSSIBILITY
AlexSteffen_2005G WE NEED TO START DOING THINGS LIKE LULA PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL HOW MANY PEOPLE KNEW OF LULA BEFORE TODAY
AlexSteffen_2005G SHIFTS THE BALANCE FROM THE STANDARD SORT OF NORTH SOUTH DIALOGUE
AlexSteffen_2005G INTO A WHOLE NEW WAY OF GLOBAL COLLABORATION I WOULD KEEP YOUR EYE ON THIS FELLOW
AlexSteffen_2005G TO A HUGE RISE IN ESPECIALLY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD IN
AlexSteffen_2005G PEOPLE 'S INTEREST IN AND PASSION FOR DEMOCRACY WE GET SO LITTLE NEWS ABOUT THE DEVELOPING WORLD THAT WE OFTEN FORGET THAT THERE ARE LITERALLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE STRUGGLING TO CHANGE THINGS TO BE FAIRER FREER MORE DEMOCRATIC LESS CORRUPT
AlexSteffen_2005G AND YOU KNOW WE DON 'T HEAR THOSE STORIES ENOUGH BUT IT 'S HAPPENING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THESE TOOLS ARE PART OF WHAT 'S MAKING IT POSSIBLE NOW WHEN YOU ADD ALL THOSE THINGS TOGETHER WHEN YOU ADD TOGETHER LEAPFROGGING AND NEW KINDS OF TOOLS YOU KNOW SECOND SUPERPOWER STUFF ETC WHAT DO YOU GET WELL VERY QUICKLY YOU GET A BRIGHT GREEN FUTURE FOR THE DEVELOPING WORLD YOU GET FOR EXAMPLE
AlexSteffen_2005G GREEN POWER SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE WORLD YOU GET THIS IS A BUILDING IN HYDERABAD INDIA IT 'S THE GREENEST BUILDING IN THE WORLD
AlexSteffen_2005G YOU GET GRASSROOTS SOLUTIONS THINGS THAT WORK FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO CAPITAL OR LIMITED ACCESS YOU GET BAREFOOT SOLAR ENGINEERS CARRYING SOLAR PANELS INTO THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS YOU GET ACCESS TO DISTANCE MEDICINE THESE ARE INDIAN NURSES LEARNING HOW TO USE PDAS TO ACCESS DATABASES THAT HAVE INFORMATION THAT THEY DON 'T HAVE ACCESS TO AT HOME IN A DISTANT MANNER
AlexSteffen_2005G YOU GET NEW TOOLS FOR PEOPLE IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD THESE ARE LED LIGHTS THAT HELP THE ROUGHLY BILLION PEOPLE OUT THERE FOR WHOM NIGHTFALL MEANS DARKNESS TO HAVE A NEW MEANS OF OPERATING THESE ARE REFRIGERATORS THAT REQUIRE NO ELECTRICITY THEY 'RE POT WITHIN A POT DESIGN
AlexSteffen_2005G AND YOU GET WATER SOLUTIONS WATER 'S ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS HERE 'S A DESIGN FOR HARVESTING RAINWATER THAT 'S SUPER CHEAP AND AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD HERE 'S A DESIGN FOR DISTILLING WATER USING SUNLIGHT
AlexSteffen_2005G HERE 'S A FOG CATCHER WHICH IF YOU LIVE IN A MOIST JUNGLE LIKE AREA WILL DISTILL WATER FROM THE AIR THAT 'S CLEAN AND DRINKABLE
AlexSteffen_2005G HERE 'S A WAY OF TRANSPORTING WATER I JUST LOVE THIS YOU KNOW I MEAN CARRYING WATER IS SUCH A DRAG AND SOMEBODY JUST CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF WELL WHAT IF YOU ROLLED IT RIGHT I MEAN THAT 'S A GREAT DESIGN
AlexSteffen_2005G THIS IS A FABULOUS INVENTION LIFESTRAW BASICALLY YOU CAN SUCK ANY WATER THROUGH THIS AND IT WILL BECOME DRINKABLE BY THE TIME IT HITS YOUR LIPS SO YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE IN DESPERATE STRAITS CAN GET THIS THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE WORLDCHANGING KINDS OF THINGS EVER THIS IS A MERRY GO ROUND INVENTED BY THE COMPANY ROUNDABOUT
AlexSteffen_2005G WHICH PUMPS WATER AS KIDS PLAY
AlexSteffen_2005G IN COLLABORATIVE WAYS ALL ACROSS THE PLANET SOME OF THOSE DESIGNS INCLUDE MODELS FOR ACTING SUCH AS NEW MODELS FOR VILLAGE INSTRUCTION IN THE MIDDLE OF REFUGEE CAMPS NEW MODELS FOR PEDAGOGY FOR THE DISPLACED AND WE HAVE NEW TOOLS THIS IS ONE OF MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE THINGS ANYWHERE DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THIS IS
AlexSteffen_2005G IF YOU ARE LIVING IN ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE THE ROUGHLY HALF BILLION UNACCOUNTED FOR MINES ARE SCATTERED YOU CAN FLING THESE SEEDS OUT INTO THE FIELD AND AS THEY GROW UP THEY WILL GROW UP AROUND THE MINES THEIR ROOTS WILL DETECT THE CHEMICALS IN THEM AND WHERE THE FLOWERS TURN RED YOU DON 'T STEP
AlexSteffen_2005G YEAH SO SEEDS THAT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE
AlexSteffen_2005G AND I THINK THAT WE WILL JUST TO WRAP UP IN THE IMMORTAL WORDS OF H G WELLS I THINK THAT BETTER THINGS ARE ON THE WAY I THINK THAT IN FACT THAT ALL OF THE PAST IS BUT THE BEGINNING OF A BEGINNING
