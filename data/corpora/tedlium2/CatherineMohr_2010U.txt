CatherineMohr_2010U FIRST OF ALL I'M A GEEK I'M AN ORGANIC FOOD EATING CARBON FOOTPRINT MINIMIZING ROBOTIC SURGERY GEEK AND I REALLY WANT TO BUILD
CatherineMohr_2010U BUT I'M VERY SUSPICIOUS OF ALL OF THESE WELL MEANING ARTICLES PEOPLE LONG ON MORAL AUTHORITY AND SHORT ON DATA TELLING ME HOW TO DO THESE KINDS OF THINGS AND SO I HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT FOR MYSELF FOR EXAMPLE IS THIS
CatherineMohr_2010U I HAVE DROPPED A BLOB OF ORGANIC YOGURT FROM HAPPY SELF ACTUALIZED LOCAL COWS ON MY COUNTER TOP AND I GRAB A PAPER TOWEL
CatherineMohr_2010U THE ANSWER TO THIS CAN BE FOUND IN EMBODIED ENERGY THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT GOES INTO ANY PAPER TOWEL OR EMBODIED WATER
CatherineMohr_2010U AND EVERY TIME I USE A PAPER TOWEL I AM USING THIS MUCH VIRTUAL ENERGY AND WATER WIPE IT UP THROW IT AWAY NOW IF I COMPARE THAT TO A COTTON TOWEL THAT I CAN USE A THOUSAND TIMES
CatherineMohr_2010U I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF EMBODIED ENERGY UNTIL I WASH THAT YOGURTY TOWEL THIS IS NOW OPERATING ENERGY SO IF I THROW MY TOWEL IN THE WASHING MACHINE
CatherineMohr_2010U NOW PUT ENERGY AND WATER BACK INTO THAT TOWEL UNLESS I USE A FRONT LOADING HIGH EFFICIENCY WASHING MACHINE AND THEN IT LOOKS
CatherineMohr_2010U BUT WHAT ABOUT A RECYCLED PAPER TOWEL THAT COMES IN THOSE LITTLE HALF SHEETS WELL NOW A PAPER TOWEL LOOKS BETTER SCREW THE PAPER TOWELS
CatherineMohr_2010U LET 'S GO TO A SPONGE I WIPE IT WITH A SPONGE AND I PUT IT UNDER THE RUNNING WATER AND I HAVE A LOT LESS ENERGY AND A LOT MORE WATER UNLESS YOU'RE LIKE ME AND YOU LEAVE THE HANDLE IN THE POSITION OF HOT EVEN WHEN YOU TURN IT ON
CatherineMohr_2010U AND THEN YOU START TO USE MORE ENERGY OR WORSE YOU LET IT RUN UNTIL IT'S WARM TO RINSE OUT YOUR TOWEL AND NOW ALL BETS ARE OFF SO
CatherineMohr_2010U WHAT THIS SAYS IS THAT SOMETIMES THE THINGS THAT YOU LEAST EXPECT THE POSITION IN WHICH YOU PUT THE HANDLE
CatherineMohr_2010U HAVE A BIGGER EFFECT THAN ANY OF THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU WERE TRYING TO OPTIMIZE NOW IMAGINE SOMEONE AS TWISTED AS ME TRYING TO BUILD A HOUSE
CatherineMohr_2010U MY HUSBAND AND I ARE DOING RIGHT NOW AND SO WE WANTED TO KNOW HOW GREEN COULD WE BE AND THERE'S A THOUSAND AND ONE ARTICLES OUT THERE TELLING US HOW TO MAKE ALL THESE GREEN TRADE OFFS
CatherineMohr_2010U AND THEY ARE JUST AS SUSPECT IN TELLING US TO OPTIMIZE THESE LITTLE THINGS AROUND THE EDGES AND MISSING THE ELEPHANT IN THE LIVING
CatherineMohr_2010U NOW THE AVERAGE HOUSE HAS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MEGAWATT HOURS OF EMBODIED ENERGY IN IT THIS IS THE ENERGY IT TAKES TO MAKE IT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PAPER TOWELS WE WANTED TO KNOW HOW MUCH BETTER WE COULD DO
CatherineMohr_2010U AND SO LIKE MANY PEOPLE WE START WITH A HOUSE ON A LOT AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A TYPICAL CONSTRUCTION ON THE TOP AND WHAT WE'RE DOING ON THE BOTTOM
CatherineMohr_2010U SO FIRST WE DEMOLISH IT IT TAKES SOME ENERGY BUT IF YOU DECONSTRUCT IT YOU TAKE IT ALL APART YOU USE THE BITS YOU CAN GET SOME OF THAT ENERGY BACK
CatherineMohr_2010U WE THEN DUG A BIG HOLE TO PUT IN A RAINWATER CATCHMENT TANK TO TAKE OUR YARD WATER INDEPENDENT AND THEN WE POURED A BIG
CatherineMohr_2010U FOUNDATION FOR PASSIVE SOLAR NOW YOU CAN REDUCE THE EMBODIED ENERGY BY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT BY USING HIGH FLY ASH CONCRETE
CatherineMohr_2010U WE THEN PUT IN FRAMING AND SO THIS IS FRAMING LUMBER COMPOSITE MATERIALS AND IT'S KIND OF HARD TO GET THE EMBODIED ENERGY OUT OF THAT BUT IT CAN BE A SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE IF YOU USE F S C CERTIFIED LUMBER
CatherineMohr_2010U WE THEN GO ON TO THE FIRST THING THAT WAS VERY SURPRISING IF WE PUT ALUMINUM WINDOWS IN THIS HOUSE
CatherineMohr_2010U WE WOULD DOUBLE THE ENERGY USE RIGHT THERE NOW PVC IS A LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT STILL NOT AS GOOD AS THE WOOD THAT WE CHOSE
CatherineMohr_2010U WE THEN PUT IN PLUMBING ELECTRICAL AND HVAC AND INSULATE NOW SPRAY FOAM IS AN EXCELLENT INSULATOR IT FILLS IN ALL THE CRACKS BUT IT IS PRETTY HIGH EMBODIED ENERGY
CatherineMohr_2010U AND SPRAYED IN CELLULOSE OR BLUE JEANS IS A MUCH LOWER ENERGY ALTERNATIVE TO THAT WE ALSO USED STRAW BALE IN FILL FOR OUR LIBRARY
CatherineMohr_2010U WHICH HAS ZERO EMBODIED ENERGY WHEN IT COMES TIME TO SHEETROCK IF YOU USE ECOROCK IT'S ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE EMBODIED ENERGY OF STANDARD SHEETROCK
CatherineMohr_2010U SO NOW WE ADD IN THE FINAL CONSTRUCTION ENERGY WE ADD IT ALL UP AND WE'VE BUILT A HOUSE FOR LESS THAN HALF OF THE TYPICAL EMBODIED ENERGY FOR BUILDING A HOUSE LIKE THIS
CatherineMohr_2010U BUT BEFORE WE PAT OURSELVES TOO MUCH ON THE BACK WE HAVE POURED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE MEGAWATT HOURS OF ENERGY INTO CONSTRUCTING THIS HOUSE WHEN THERE WAS A HOUSE THERE BEFORE
CatherineMohr_2010U AND SO THE QUESTION IS HOW COULD WE MAKE THAT BACK AND SO IF I RUN MY NEW ENERGY EFFICIENT HOUSE FORWARD COMPARED WITH THE OLD NON ENERGY EFFICIENT HOUSE WE MAKE IT BACK IN ABOUT SIX YEARS
CatherineMohr_2010U NOW I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE UPGRADED THE OLD HOUSE TO BE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT AND IN THAT CASE IT WOULD TAKE ME MORE ABOUT TWENTY YEARS TO BREAK EVEN
CatherineMohr_2010U NOW IF I HADN'T PAID ATTENTION TO EMBODIED ENERGY IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US OVER FIFTY YEARS TO BREAK EVEN COMPARED TO THE UPGRADED HOUSE
CatherineMohr_2010U SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN ON THE SCALE OF MY PORTION OF THE HOUSE THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT AS MUCH AS I DRIVE
CatherineMohr_2010U IN A YEAR IT'S ABOUT FIVE TIMES AS MUCH AS IF I WENT ENTIRELY VEGETARIAN BUT MY ELEPHANT IN THE LIVING ROOM FLIES
CatherineMohr_2010U CLEARLY I NEED TO WALK HOME FROM TED BUT ALL THE CALCULATIONS FOR EMBODIED ENERGY ARE ON THE BLOG
CatherineMohr_2010U AND REMEMBER IT'S SOMETIMES THE THINGS THAT YOU ARE NOT EXPECTING TO BE THE BIGGEST CHANGES THAT ARE THANK YOU
