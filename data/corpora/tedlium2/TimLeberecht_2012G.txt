TimLeberecht_2012G@42.7:46.67 HOWEVER IN THE SAME SURVEY ONLY FOUR PERCENT OF EMPLOYEES AGREED
TimLeberecht_2012G@47.2:49.61 COMPANIES ARE LOSING CONTROL
TimLeberecht_2012G@61.37:65.67 YOUR BRAND IS WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY ABOUT YOU WHEN YOU 'RE NOT IN THE ROOM
TimLeberecht_2012G@74.34:81.62 THEY CAN LISTEN AND JOIN THE CONVERSATION IN FACT THEY HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER THE LOSS OF CONTROL THAN EVER BEFORE
TimLeberecht_2012G@82.29:84.04 THEY CAN DESIGN FOR IT
TimLeberecht_2012G@89.43:98.19 THEY CAN COLLABORATE WITH THEM ON THE CREATION OF IDEAS KNOWLEDGE CONTENT DESIGNS AND PRODUCT THEY CAN GIVE THEM MORE CONTROL OVER PRICING
TimLeberecht_2012G@98.3:108.09 WHICH IS WHAT THE BAND RADIOHEAD DID WITH ITS PAY AS YOU LIKE ONLINE RELEASE OF ITS ALBUM IN RAINBOWS BUYERS COULD DETERMINE THE PRICE BUT THE OFFER WAS EXCLUSIVE
TimLeberecht_2012G@108.14:110.8 AND ONLY STOOD FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME
TimLeberecht_2012G@111.06:114.71 THE ALBUM SOLD MORE COPIES THAN PREVIOUS RELEASES OF THE BAND
TimLeberecht_2012G@115.57:121.49 THE DANISH CHOCOLATE COMPANY ANTHON BERG OPENED A SO CALLED GENEROUS STORE IN COPENHAGEN
TimLeberecht_2012G@121.74:127.31 IT ASKED CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE CHOCOLATE WITH THE PROMISE OF GOOD DEEDS TOWARDS LOVED ONES
TimLeberecht_2012G@127.67:132.59 IT TURNED TRANSACTIONS INTO INTERACTIONS AND GENEROSITY INTO A CURRENCY
TimLeberecht_2012G@133.16:147.72 COMPANIES CAN EVEN GIVE CONTROL TO HACKERS WHEN MICROSOFT KINECT CAME OUT THE MOTION CONTROLLED ADD ON TO ITS XBOX GAMING CONSOLE IT IMMEDIATELY DREW THE ATTENTION OF HACKERS MICROSOFT FIRST FOUGHT OFF THE HACKS
TimLeberecht_2012G@147.72:153.76 BUT THEN SHIFTED COURSE WHEN IT REALIZED THAT ACTIVELY SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITY CAME WITH BENEFITS
TimLeberecht_2012G@154.09:156 THE SENSE OF CO OWNERSHIP
TimLeberecht_2012G@156.35:159.6 THE FREE PUBLICITY THE ADDED VALUE ALL HELPED DRIVE SALES
TimLeberecht_2012G@159.87:165.06 THE ULTIMATE EMPOWERMENT OF CUSTOMERS IS TO ASK THEM NOT TO BUY
TimLeberecht_2012G@165.23:175.68 OUTDOOR CLOTHIER PATAGONIA ENCOURAGED PROSPECTIVE BUYERS TO CHECK OUT EBAY FOR ITS USED PRODUCTS AND TO RESOLE THEIR SHOES BEFORE PURCHASING NEW ONES

TimLeberecht_2012G@190.81:192.41 BASED ON SHARED VALUES
TimLeberecht_2012G@192.64:199.5 RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT GIVING EMPLOYEES MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR WORK MAKES THEM HAPPIER AND MORE PRODUCTIVE
TimLeberecht_2012G@199.84:206.69 THE BRAZILIAN COMPANY SEMCO GROUP FAMOUSLY LETS EMPLOYEES SET THEIR OWN WORK SCHEDULES AND EVEN THEIR SALARIES
TimLeberecht_2012G@211.96:215.09 COMPANIES CAN GIVE PEOPLE MORE CONTROL
TimLeberecht_2012G@215.24:216.91 BUT THEY CAN ALSO GIVE THEM
TimLeberecht_2012G@230.17:235.96 GIVING PEOPLE LESS CONTROL MIGHT BE A WONDERFUL WAY TO COUNTER THE ABUNDANCE OF CHOICE
TimLeberecht_2012G@240.42:246.62 NEXTPEDITION TURNS THE TRIP INTO A GAME WITH SURPRISING TWISTS AND TURNS ALONG THE WAY
TimLeberecht_2012G@246.91:253.52 IT DOES NOT TELL THE TRAVELER WHERE SHE 'S GOING UNTIL THE VERY LAST MINUTE AND INFORMATION IS PROVIDED JUST IN TIME

TimLeberecht_2012G@281.68:291.31 A RECENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT HAVING EMPLOYEES COMPLETE OCCASIONAL ALTRUISTIC TASKS THROUGHOUT THE DAY INCREASES THEIR SENSE OF OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY
TimLeberecht_2012G@297.77:302.38 THAT CONNECT OLD AND NEW EMPLOYEES HELPING THEM GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER FAST
TimLeberecht_2012G@303.03:307.56 BY APPLYING A STRICT PROCESS WE GIVE THEM LESS CONTROL LESS CHOICE

TimLeberecht_2012G@311.43:318.17 COMPANIES ARE THE MAKERS OF THEIR FORTUNES AND LIKE ALL OF US THEY ARE UTTERLY EXPOSED TO SERENDIPITY
TimLeberecht_2012G@318.69:320.42 THAT SHOULD MAKE THEM MORE HUMBLE
TimLeberecht_2012G@331.39:333.94 STAYING TRUE TO THEIR TRUE SELVES
TimLeberecht_2012G@334.07:336.89 IS THE ONLY SUSTAINABLE VALUE PROPOSITION
TimLeberecht_2012G@337.1:339.64 OR AS THE BALLET DANCER ALONZO KING SAID

TimLeberecht_2012G@342.95:345.57 FOR THE TRUE SELVES OF COMPANIES TO COME THROUGH
TimLeberecht_2012G@354.85:357.75 A SMILE IS A DOOR THAT IS HALF OPEN
TimLeberecht_2012G@361.96:366.15 COMPANIES CAN GIVE THEIR EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS MORE CONTROL OR LESS
TimLeberecht_2012G@366.35:369.48 THEY CAN WORRY ABOUT HOW MUCH OPENNESS IS GOOD FOR THEM
TimLeberecht_2012G@369.49:371.38 AND WHAT NEEDS TO STAY CLOSED
TimLeberecht_2012G@371.78:374.13 OR THEY CAN SIMPLY SMILE
