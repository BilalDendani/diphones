LakshmiPratury_2007 SO I THOUGHT I WILL TALK ABOUT DEATH
LakshmiPratury_2007 SO ART BUCHWALD LEFT HIS LEGACY OF HUMOR WITH A VIDEO THAT APPEARED SOON AFTER HE DIED SAYING HI I'M ART BUCHWALD AND I JUST DIED
LakshmiPratury_2007 AND MIKE WHO I MET AT GALAPAGOS
LakshmiPratury_2007 WHICH I WON AT TED
LakshmiPratury_2007 LEAVING NOTES ON CYBERSPACE WHERE HE IS CHRONICLING HIS JOURNEY THROUGH CANCER
LakshmiPratury_2007 AND MY FATHER LEFT ME A LEGACY OF HIS HANDWRITING THROUGH LETTERS AND A NOTEBOOK
LakshmiPratury_2007 IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OF HIS LIFE WHEN HE WAS SICK
LakshmiPratury_2007 HE FILLED A NOTEBOOK WITH HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT ME
LakshmiPratury_2007 ABOUT MY STRENGTHS
LakshmiPratury_2007 AND HELD A MIRROR TO MY LIFE
LakshmiPratury_2007 AFTER HE DIED I REALIZED THAT NO ONE WRITES TO ME ANYMORE HANDWRITING IS A DISAPPEARING ART I'M ALL FOR EMAIL AND THINKING WHILE TYPING BUT WHY GIVE UP OLD HABITS FOR NEW
LakshmiPratury_2007 WHY CAN'T WE HAVE LETTER WRITING AND EMAIL EXCHANGE IN OUR LIVES
LakshmiPratury_2007 THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I WANT TO TRADE ALL THOSE YEARS THAT I WAS TOO BUSY TO SIT WITH MY DAD AND CHAT
LakshmiPratury_2007 AND TRADE ALL THOSE YEARS FOR
LakshmiPratury_2007 I TAKE OUT HIS LETTERS
LakshmiPratury_2007 MAYBE WE ALL NEED TO LEAVE OUR CHILDREN WITH A VALUE LEGACY AND NOT A FINANCIAL ONE
LakshmiPratury_2007 VALUE FOR THINGS WITH A PERSONAL TOUCH AN AUTOGRAPH BOOK A SOUL SEARCHING LETTER IF A FRACTION OF THIS POWERFUL TED AUDIENCE COULD BE INSPIRED TO BUY A BEAUTIFUL PAPER JOHN IT'LL BE A RECYCLED ONE
LakshmiPratury_2007 AND WRITE A BEAUTIFUL LETTER TO SOMEONE THEY LOVE WE ACTUALLY MAY START A REVOLUTION WHERE OUR CHILDREN MAY GO TO PENMANSHIP CLASSES
LakshmiPratury_2007 SO WHAT DO I PLAN TO LEAVE FOR MY SON I COLLECT AUTOGRAPH BOOKS AND THOSE OF YOU AUTHORS IN THE AUDIENCE KNOW I HOUND YOU FOR THEM AND CDS TOO TRACY I PLAN TO PUBLISH
LakshmiPratury_2007 MY OWN NOTEBOOK
LakshmiPratury_2007 AS I WITNESSED MY FATHER 'S BODY BEING SWALLOWED BY FIRE
LakshmiPratury_2007 I SAT BY HIS FUNERAL PYRE AND WROTE I HAVE NO IDEA HOW I'M GOING TO DO IT BUT I AM COMMITTED TO COMPILING HIS THOUGHTS AND MINE INTO A BOOK
LakshmiPratury_2007 AND LEAVE THAT PUBLISHED BOOK FOR MY SON
LakshmiPratury_2007 I'D LIKE TO END WITH A FEW VERSES OF WHAT I WROTE AT MY FATHER 'S CREMATION AND THOSE LINGUISTS PLEASE PARDON THE GRAMMAR BECAUSE I'VE NOT LOOKED AT IT IN THE LAST TEN YEARS I TOOK IT OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME TO COME HERE
