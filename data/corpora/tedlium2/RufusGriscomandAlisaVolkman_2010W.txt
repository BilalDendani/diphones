RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@19.42:21.26 SO THIS IS WHERE OUR STORY
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@22.17:31.67 THE DRAMATIC MOMENTS OF THE BIRTH OUR FIRST SON DECLAN OBVIOUSLY A REALLY PROFOUND MOMENT AND IT CHANGED OUR LIVES IN MANY WAYS IT ALSO CHANGED OUR LIVES IN MANY UNEXPECTED WAYS
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@31.94:39.84 AND THOSE UNEXPECTED WAYS WE LATER REFLECTED ON THAT EVENTUALLY SPAWNED A BUSINESS IDEA BETWEEN THE TWO OF US AND A YEAR LATER WE LAUNCHED BABBLE A WEBSITE FOR PARENTS
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@66.32:78.13 DATING SITE BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE JOKES THAT WE GET SEX BEGETS BABIES YOU FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS ON NERVE AND YOU SHOULD END UP ON BABBLE WHICH WE DID AND WE MIGHT LAUNCH A GERIATRIC SITE AS OUR THIRD
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@79.68:93.64 BUT FOR US THE CONTINUITY BETWEEN NERVE AND BABBLE WAS NOT JUST THE LIFE STAGE THING WHICH IS OF COURSE RELEVANT BUT IT WAS REALLY MORE ABOUT OUR DESIRE TO SPEAK VERY HONESTLY ABOUT SUBJECTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFICULTY SPEAKING HONESTLY ABOUT
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@94.02:108.01 IT SEEMS TO US THAT WHEN PEOPLE START DISSEMBLING PEOPLE START LYING ABOUT THINGS THAT'S WHEN IT GETS REALLY INTERESTING THAT'S A SUBJECT THAT WE WANT TO DIVE INTO AND WE'VE BEEN SURPRISED TO FIND AS YOUNG PARENTS THAT THERE ARE ALMOST MORE TABOOS AROUND PARENTING THAN THERE ARE
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@109.71:120.44 IT'S TRUE SO LIKE WE SAID THE EARLY YEARS WERE REALLY WONDERFUL BUT THEY WERE ALSO REALLY DIFFICULT AND WE FEEL LIKE SOME OF THAT DIFFICULTY WAS BECAUSE OF THIS FALSE ADVERTISEMENT AROUND PARENTING
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@122.64:128.93 WE SUBSCRIBED TO A LOT OF MAGAZINES DID OUR HOMEWORK BUT REALLY EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK AROUND WE WERE SURROUNDED BY IMAGES LIKE THIS
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@140.29:149.97 IT WAS NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL RG WHEN WE LOWERED THE GLOSSY PARENTING MAGAZINE THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT WITH THESE BEAUTIFUL IMAGES AND LOOKED AT THE SCENE IN OUR ACTUAL LIVING ROOM IT LOOKED A LITTLE MORE LIKE THIS
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@160.99:169.21 YES YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE DISCONNECT WAS HAPPENING FOR US WE REALLY FELT LIKE WHAT WE WENT IN EXPECTING HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT WE WERE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCING
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@169.85:178.90 AND SO WE DECIDED WE REALLY WANTED TO GIVE IT TO PARENTS STRAIGHT WE REALLY WANTED TO LET THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REALITIES OF PARENTING WERE IN AN HONEST WAY
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@179.13:187.30 SO TODAY WHAT WE WOULD LOVE TO DO IS SHARE WITH YOU FOUR PARENTING TABOOS AND OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY MORE THAN FOUR THINGS YOU CAN'T SAY ABOUT PARENTING
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@188.07:195.27 BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY FOUR THAT ARE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR US PERSONALLY SO THE FIRST TABOO NUMBER ONE
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@195.93:206.84 YOU CAN'T SAY YOU DIDN'T FALL IN LOVE WITH YOUR BABY IN THE VERY FIRST MINUTE I REMEMBER VIVIDLY SITTING THERE IN THE HOSPITAL WE WERE IN THE PROCESS OF GIVING BIRTH TO OUR FIRST CHILD
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@226.51:233.43 ME THE VOICES OF FRIENDS SAYING THE MOMENT THEY PUT THE BABY IN YOUR HANDS YOU WILL FEEL A SENSE OF LOVE
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@234.32:237.19 THAT IS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE MORE POWERFUL THAN ANYTHING
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@237.44:247.91 EVER EXPERIENCED IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE SO I WAS BRACING MYSELF FOR THE MOMENT THE BABY WAS COMING AND I WAS READY FOR THIS MACK TRUCK OF LOVE TO JUST KNOCK ME OFF MY FEET
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@248.37:255.30 AND INSTEAD WHEN THE BABY WAS PLACED IN MY HANDS IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT THIS PICTURE IS FROM LITERALLY A FEW
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@255.95:264.61 AFTER THE BABY WAS PLACED IN MY HANDS AND I BROUGHT HIM OVER AND YOU CAN SEE OUR EYES WERE GLISTENING I WAS OVERWHELMED WITH LOVE AND AFFECTION FOR MY WIFE
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@265.07:276.82 WITH DEEP DEEP GRATITUDE THAT WE HAD WHAT APPEARED TO BE A HEALTHY CHILD AND IT WAS ALSO OF COURSE SURREAL I MEAN I HAD TO CHECK THE TAGS AND MAKE SURE I WAS INCREDULOUS ARE YOU SURE THIS IS OUR CHILD AND THIS WAS ALL QUITE REMARKABLE
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@277.50:289.92 BUT WHAT I FELT TOWARDS THE CHILD AT THAT MOMENT WAS DEEP AFFECTION BUT NOTHING LIKE WHAT I FEEL FOR HIM NOW FIVE YEARS LATER AND SO WE'VE DONE SOMETHING HERE THAT IS HERETICAL WE HAVE CHARTED
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@296.63:300.55 THIS AS YOU KNOW IS AN ACT OF HERESY YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO CHART LOVE
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@308.76:317.30 AND I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT LOVE IS A PROCESS AND I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH THINKING OF LOVE AS SOMETHING THAT'S BINARY IS THAT IT CAUSES US TO BE
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@318.30:326.68 UNDULY CONCERNED THAT LOVE IS FRAUDULENT OR INADEQUATE OR WHAT HAVE YOU AND I THINK I'M SPEAKING OBVIOUSLY HERE TO THE FATHER 'S EXPERIENCE BUT I THINK A LOT OF MEN DO
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@326.82:334.07 GO THROUGH THIS SENSE IN THE EARLY MONTHS MAYBE THEIR FIRST YEAR THAT THEIR EMOTIONAL RESPONSE IS INADEQUATE IN SOME
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@334.64:340.71 I'M GLAD RUFUS IS BRINGING THIS UP BECAUSE YOU CAN NOTICE WHERE HE DIPS IN THE FIRST YEARS WHERE I THINK I WAS DOING MOST OF THE WORK
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@341.95:347.09 BUT WE LIKE TO JOKE IN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF ALL OF OUR CHILDREN 'S LIVES THIS IS UNCLE RUFUS
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@348.47:351.50 A VERY AFFECTIONATE UNCLE VERY
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@352.63:361.80 AND I OFTEN JOKE WITH RUFUS WHEN HE COMES HOME THAT I'M NOT SURE HE WOULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO FIND OUR CHILD IN A LINE UP AMONGST OTHER BABIES SO I ACTUALLY THREW A POP QUIZ HERE ONTO
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@384.91:385.40 CRUEL
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@391.59:399.42 YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT HOW LONELY HAVING A BABY CAN BE I ENJOYED BEING PREGNANT I LOVED IT I FELT INCREDIBLY CONNECTED TO THE COMMUNITY AROUND ME
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@399.95:408.74 I FELT LIKE EVERYONE WAS PARTICIPATING IN MY PREGNANCY ALL AROUND ME TRACKING IT DOWN TO THE ACTUAL DUE DATE I FELT LIKE I WAS A VESSEL OF THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@409.59:419.54 THAT CONTINUED INTO THE THE HOSPITAL IT WAS REALLY EXHILARATING I WAS SHOWER WITH GIFTS AND FLOWERS AND VISITORS IT WAS A REALLY WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE BUT WHEN I GOT HOME
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@419.95:429.00 I SUDDENLY FELT VERY DISCONNECTED AND SUDDENLY SHUT IN AND SHUT OUT AND I WAS REALLY SURPRISED BY THOSE FEELINGS I DID EXPECT IT TO BE DIFFICULT
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@436.44:441.36 AND I WAS REALLY SURPRISED THAT NO ONE HAD TALKED TO ME THAT I WAS GOING TO BE FEELING THIS WAY AND I CALLED MY
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@443.14:450.72 I'M VERY CLOSE TO AND HAD THREE CHILDREN AND I ASKED HER WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME I WAS GOING TO BE FEELING THIS WAY THAT I WAS GOING TO HAVE THESE
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@451.64:459.32 FEELING INCREDIBLY ISOLATED AND SHE SAID I'LL NEVER FORGET IT 'S JUST NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO SAY TO A MOTHER THAT'S HAVING A BABY FOR THE FIRST TIME
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@460.59:472.71 AND OF COURSE WE THINK IT'S PRECISELY WHAT YOU REALLY SHOULD BE SAYING TO MOTHERS WHO HAVE KIDS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THAT THIS OF COURSE ONE OF THE THEMES FOR US IS THAT WE THINK THAT
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@474.11:481.00 CANDOR AND BRUTAL HONESTY IS CRITICAL TO US COLLECTIVELY BEING GREAT PARENTS AND IT'S HARD NOT TO THINK
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@481.27:492.86 THAT PART OF WHAT LEADS TO THIS SENSE OF ISOLATION IS OUR MODERN WORLD SO ALISA 'S EXPERIENCE IS NOT ISOLATED SO YOUR FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT OF MOTHERS SURVEYED REPORT FEELINGS OF LONELINESS OF THOSE SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@493.41:503.11 MOST LONELY WHEN THEIR KIDS ARE ZERO TO FIVE PROBABLY REALLY ZERO TO TWO IN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING THIS WE LOOKED AT HOW SOME OTHER CULTURES AROUND THE WORLD DEAL WITH THIS PERIOD OF TIME
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@503.82:515.05 BECAUSE HERE IN THE WESTERN WORLD LESS THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF US LIVE NEAR OUR FAMILY MEMBERS WHICH I THINK IS PART OF WHY THIS IS SUCH A TOUGH PERIOD SO TO TAKE ONE EXAMPLE AMONG MANY IN SOUTHERN INDIA
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@515.35:524.06 A PRACTICE KNOWN AS JHOLABIHARI IN WHICH THE PREGNANT WOMAN WHEN SHE'S SEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT MOVES IN WITH HER MOTHER AND GOES THROUGH A SERIES OF RITUALS AND CEREMONIES
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@535.20:545.08 SO TABOO NUMBER THREE YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT YOUR MISCARRIAGE BUT TODAY I'LL TALK ABOUT MINE SO AFTER WE HAD DECLAN WE KIND OF RECALIBRATED OUR EXPECTATIONS WE THOUGHT WE ACTUALLY
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@545.50:549.04 COULD GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN AND THOUGHT WE KNEW WHAT WE'D BE UP AGAINST
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@549.69:552.05 AND WE WERE GRATEFUL THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET PREGNANT
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@552.91:554.39 SOON LEARNED THAT WE WERE HAVING A BOY
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@567.92:575.77 AS I WAS WORKING THROUGH THAT MOURNING PROCESS I WAS AMAZED THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE ANYBODY I REALLY WANTED TO CRAWL INTO A HOLE
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@576.16:588.42 AND I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HOW I WAS GOING TO WORK MY WAY BACK INTO MY SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AND I REALIZE I THINK THE WAY I WAS FEELING THAT WAY IS ON A REALLY DEEP GUT LEVEL I WAS FEELING A LOT OF SHAME
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@602.76:611.40 AND JUST ME AS A WOMAN SO IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME AS I STARTED WORKING THROUGH IT MORE I STARTED CLIMBING OUT OF THAT HOLE AND TALKING WITH OTHER PEOPLE
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@611.58:622.72 I WAS REALLY AMAZED BY ALL THE STORIES THAT STARTED FLOODING IN PEOPLE I INTERACTED WITH DAILY WORKED WITH WAS FRIENDS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS THAT I HAD KNOWN A LONG TIME HAD NEVER SHARED WITH ME THEIR OWN STORIES
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@623.10:634.18 AND I JUST REMEMBER FEELING ALL THESE STORIES CAME OUT OF THE WOODWORK AND I FELT LIKE I HAPPENED UPON THIS SECRET SOCIETY OF WOMEN THAT I NOW WAS A PART OF WHICH WAS REASSURING AND AND ALSO REALLY CONCERNING
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@635.99:643.56 AND I THINK MISCARRIAGE IS AN INVISIBLE LOSS THERE'S NOT REALLY A LOT OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT AROUND IT THERE'S NO REALLY CEREMONY
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@652.51:662.71 WHICH IS TOO BAD BECAUSE OF COURSE IT'S A VERY COMMON AND VERY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PERCENT OF ALL PREGNANCIES RESULT IN MISCARRIAGE AND I FIND THIS ASTOUNDING IN A SURVEY SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT OF WOMEN
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@662.99:670.09 SAID THAT MISCARRIAGE THEY FELT WAS PARTLY THEIR FAULT WHICH IS AWFUL AND ASTOUNDINGLY TWENTY TWO PERCENT SAID THEY WOULD HID A MISCARRIAGE FROM
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@671.17:675.90 SO TABOO NUMBER FOUR YOU CAN'T SAY THAT YOUR AVERAGE HAPPINESS
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@676.51:688.80 HAS DECLINED SINCE HAVING A CHILD THE PARTY LINE IS THAT EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF MY LIFE HAS JUST GOTTEN DRAMATICALLY BETTER EVER SINCE I PARTICIPATED IN THE MIRACLE THAT IS CHILDBIRTH AND FAMILY
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@689.83:697.23 NEVER FORGET I REMEMBER VIVIDLY TO THIS DAY OUR FIRST SON DECLAN WAS NINE MONTHS OLD AND I WAS SITTING THERE ON THE COUCH AND I WAS
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@697.62:708.28 READING DANIEL GILBERT 'S WONDERFUL BOOK STUMBLING ON HAPPINESS AND I GOT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY THROUGH AND THERE WAS A CHART ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE ON THE RIGHT HAND PAGE THAT
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@719.22:729.05 DROP OF MARITAL SATISFACTION WHICH IS CLOSELY ALIGNED WE ALL KNOW WITH BROADER HAPPINESS THAT DOESN'T RISE AGAIN UNTIL YOUR FIRST CHILD GOES TO COLLEGE
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@730.09:737.66 SO I'M SITTING HERE LOOKING AT THE NEXT TWO DECADES OF MY LIFE THIS CHASM OF HAPPINESS THAT WE'RE DRIVING OUR PROVERBIAL CONVERTIBLE STRAIGHT INTO
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@740.59:751.27 SO YOU CAN IMAGINE I MEAN AGAIN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS WERE DIFFICULT BUT WE'D COME OUT OF IT AND WERE REALLY SHOCKED TO SEE THIS STUDY SO WE REALLY WANTED TO TAKE A DEEPER LOOK AT IT IN HOPES THAT WE WOULD FIND A SILVER LINING
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@751.59:759.63 AND THAT'S WHEN IT'S GREAT TO BE RUNNING A WEBSITE FOR PARENTS BECAUSE WE GOT THIS INCREDIBLE REPORTER TO GO AND INTERVIEW ALL THE SCIENTISTS
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@759.88:766.66 WHO CONDUCTED THESE FOUR STUDIES WE SAID SOMETHING IS WRONG HERE THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING FROM THESE STUDIES IT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE THAT
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@770.23:776.46 SO LIZ MITCHELL DID A WONDERFUL JOB WITH THIS PIECE AND SHE INTERVIEWED FOUR SCIENTISTS AND SHE ALSO INTERVIEWED
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@786.21:795.73 THROUGHOUT LIFE AVERAGE HAPPINESS IS OF COURSE INADEQUATE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SPEAK TO THE MOMENT BY MOMENT EXPERIENCE AND SO THIS IS WHAT WE THINK IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN YOU
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@797.56:798.56 MOMENT TO MOMENT
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@801.07:809.64 SO WE ALL REMEMBER AS CHILDREN THE TINIEST LITTLE THING AND WE SEE IT ON THE FACES OF OUR CHILDREN THE TINIEST LITTLE THING CAN JUST ROCKET THEM TO THESE HEIGHTS OF
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@811.01:819.06 ADULATION AND THEN THE NEXT TINIEST LITTLE THING CAN CAUSE THEM JUST TO PLUMMET TO THE DEPTHS OF DESPAIR AND IT'S JUST EXTRAORDINARY TO WATCH AND WE REMEMBER IT OURSELVES
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@819.26:830.06 AND THEN OF COURSE AS YOU GET OLDER IT'S ALMOST LIKE AGE IS A FORM OF LITHIUM AS YOU GET OLDER YOU BECOME MORE STABLE AND PART OF WHAT HAPPENS I THINK IN YOUR TWENTIES AND THIRTIES IS YOU START TO LEARN TO
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@830.41:832.90 YOUR HAPPINESS YOU START TO REALIZE THAT HEY
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@834.45:843.82 I COULD GO TO THIS LIVE MUSIC EVENT AND HAVE AN UTTERLY TRANSFORMING EXPERIENCE THAT WILL COVER MY ENTIRE BODY WITH GOOSEBUMPS BUT IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT I'LL FEEL CLAUSTROPHOBIC AND I WON 'T BE ABLE TO GET A BEER
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@845.97:852.51 SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO I'VE GOT A GOOD STEREO AT HOME SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO SO YOUR AVERAGE HAPPINESS GOES UP
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@853.47:855.63 BUT YOU LOSE THOSE TRANSCENDENT MOMENTS
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@856.09:862.14 AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR FIRST CHILD AND THEN YOU REALLY RESUBMIT YOURSELF TO THESE HIGHS AND LOWS
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@862.98:870.74 THE HIGHS BEING THE FIRST STEPS THE FIRST SMILE YOUR CHILD READING TO YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME THE LOWS BEING OUR HOUSE ANYTIME FROM SIX TO SEVEN EVERY NIGHT
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@872.23:881.34 BUT YOU REALIZE YOU RESUBMIT YOURSELF TO LOSING CONTROL IN A REALLY WONDERFUL WAY WHICH WE THINK PROVIDES A LOT OF MEANING TO OUR LIVES AND IS QUITE GRATIFYING
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@881.57:892.17 AND SO IN EFFECT WE TRADE AVERAGE HAPPINESS WE TRADE THE SORT OF SECURITY AND SAFETY OF A CERTAIN LEVEL OF CONTENTMENT FOR THESE TRANSCENDENT MOMENTS
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@892.83:904.12 SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE THE TWO OF US WITH A FAMILY WITH OUR THREE LITTLE BOYS IN THE THICK OF ALL THIS THERE'S ANOTHER FACTOR IN OUR CASE WE HAVE VIOLATED YET ANOTHER TABOO IN OUR OWN LIVES
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@905.04:906.39 AND THIS IS A BONUS TABOO
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@908.51:912.51 QUICK BONUS TABOO FOR YOU THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE WORKING TOGETHER ESPECIALLY WITH THREE CHILDREN
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@920.90:928.85 IN FACT WHEN WE FIRST WENT OUT TO RAISE MONEY TO START BABBLE THE VENTURE CAPITALISTS SAID WE CATEGORICALLY DON'T INVEST IN COMPANIES FOUNDED BY
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@960.24:966.84 SOMETIMES PRETTY QUICK AND SO HOW ABOUT THAT AVERAGE BASELINE OF HAPPINESS CAN WE MOVE THAT UP A LITTLE BIT
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@982.24:994.72 AND SO THIS IS WHAT AND WE THINK THAT A LOT OF PARENTS WHEN YOU GET IN THERE LIKE IN OUR CASE ANYWAY YOU PACK YOUR BAGS FOR A TRIP TO EUROPE AND YOU'RE REALLY EXCITED TO GO GET OUT OF THE AIRPLANE IT TURNS OUT YOU'RE TREKKING IN NEPAL
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@995.51:1004.51 AND TREKKING IN NEPAL IS AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE PARTICULARLY IF YOU PACK YOUR BAGS PROPERLY AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE IN FOR AND YOU'RE PSYCHED SO THE POINT OF ALL THIS FOR US TODAY IS
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W@1004.75:1013.28 NOT JUST HOPEFULLY HONESTY FOR THE SAKE OF HONESTY BUT A HOPE THAT BY BEING MORE HONEST AND CANDID ABOUT THESE EXPERIENCES THAT WE CAN ALL COLLECTIVELY BEND THAT
