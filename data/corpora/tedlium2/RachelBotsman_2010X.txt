RachelBotsman_2010X@16.53:28.70 TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE RISE OF COLLABORATIVE CONSUMPTION I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS AND TRY AND CONVINCE YOU IN JUST FIFTEEN MINUTES THAT THIS ISN'T A FLIMSY IDEA OR A SHORT TERM
RachelBotsman_2010X@53.69:61.66 ALL THE HANDS BUT IT LOOKS LIKE ALL OF YOU ON OUR SHELVES AT HOME WE HAVE A BOX SET OF THE DVD SERIES TWENTY FOUR
RachelBotsman_2010X@64.87:68.41 AROUND THREE YEARS AGO FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT NOW MY HUSBAND CHRIS AND
RachelBotsman_2010X@70.50:84.83 BUT LET 'S FACE IT WHEN YOU'VE WATCHED IT ONCE MAYBE OR TWICE YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO WATCH IT AGAIN BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW JACK BAUER IS GOING TO DEFEAT THE TERRORISTS SO THERE IS SITS ON OUR SHELVES OBSOLETE TO US BUT WITH IMMEDIATE LATENT VALUE TO SOMEONE ELSE
RachelBotsman_2010X@86.21:98.13 I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE I LIVED IN NEW YORK FOR TEN YEARS AND I AM A BIG FAN OF SEX AND THE CITY NOW I'D LOVE TO WATCH THE FIRST MOVIE AGAIN AS SORT OF A WARM UP TO THE SEQUEL COMING OUT NEXT WEEK
RachelBotsman_2010X@98.90:110.50 HOW EASILY COULD I SWAP OUR UNWANTED COPY OF TWENTY FOUR FOR A WANTED COPY OF SEX AND THE CITY NOW YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THERE'S A NEW SECTOR EMERGING CALLED SWAP TRADING NOW
RachelBotsman_2010X@114.88:121.91 ALL YOUR UNWANTED MEDIA WHAT IT DOES IS USE THE INTERNET TO CREATE AN INFINITE MARKETPLACE TO MATCH
RachelBotsman_2010X@124.82:131.71 WHATEVER THEY MAY BE THE OTHER WEEK I WENT ON ONE OF THESE SITES APPROPRIATELY CALLED SWAPTREE
RachelBotsman_2010X@143.88:151.03 WAS RONDORON WHO WANTED SWAP HIS OR HER LIKE NEW COPY OF SEX AND THE CITY FOR MY COPY OF TWENTY FOUR
RachelBotsman_2010X@151.49:160.60 SO IN OTHER WORDS WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT SWAPTREE SOLVES MY CARRYING COMPANY 'S SUGAR RUSH PROBLEM A PROBLEM THE ECONOMISTS CALL THE COINCIDENCE OF WANTS
RachelBotsman_2010X@161.01:167.75 IN APPROXIMATELY SIXTY SECONDS WHAT'S EVEN MORE AMAZING IS IT WILL PRINT OUT A PURCHASE LABEL ON THE SPOT BECAUSE IT KNOWS THE
RachelBotsman_2010X@169.26:176.22 NOW THERE ARE LAYERS OF TECHNICAL WONDER BEHIND SITES SUCH AS SWAPTREE BUT THAT'S NOT MY INTEREST AND
RachelBotsman_2010X@178.49:187.25 MY PASSION AND WHAT I'VE SPENT THE LAST FEW YEARS DEDICATED TO RESEARCHING ARE THE COLLABORATIVE BEHAVIORS AND TRUST MECHANICS INHERENT IN THESE
RachelBotsman_2010X@195.32:205.44 WITH A TOTAL STRANGER WHOSE REAL NAME I DIDN'T KNOW AND WITHOUT ANY MONEY CHANGING HANDS YET NINETY NINE PERCENT OF TRADES ON SWAPTREE HAPPEN SUCCESSFULLY
RachelBotsman_2010X@205.76:212.20 AND THE ONE PERCENT THAT RECEIVE A NEGATIVE RATING IT'S FOR RELATIVELY MINOR REASONS LIKE THE ITEM DIDN'T ARRIVE ON TIME
RachelBotsman_2010X@213.07:227.82 SO WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL DYNAMIC THAT HAS HUGE COMMERCIAL AND CULTURAL IMPLICATIONS IS AT PLAY NAMELY THAT TECHNOLOGY IS ENABLING TRUST BETWEEN STRANGERS
RachelBotsman_2010X@253.43:267.07 WHAT I FIND FASCINATING IS THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY WIRED OUR WORLD TO SHARE WHETHER THAT'S OUR NEIGHBORHOOD OUR SCHOOL OUR OFFICE OR OUR FACEBOOK NETWORK AND THAT'S CREATING AN ECONOMY OF WHAT'S MINE IS YOURS
RachelBotsman_2010X@269.63:272.12 THE GRANDFATHER OF EXCHANGE MARKETPLACES
RachelBotsman_2010X@272.43:277.60 TO CAR SHARING COMPANIES SUCH AS GOGET WHERE YOU PAY A MONTHLY FEE TO RENT CARS BY THE HOUR
RachelBotsman_2010X@288.60:297.68 SHARING AND COLLABORATING AGAIN IN WAYS THAT I BELIEVE ARE MORE HIP THAN HIPPIE I CALL THIS GROUNDSWELL COLLABORATIVE CONSUMPTION
RachelBotsman_2010X@298.55:307.74 NOW BEFORE I DIG INTO THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OF COLLABORATIVE CONSUMPTION I'D LIKE TO TRY AND ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT EVERY AUTHOR RIGHTFULLY GETS ASKED WHICH IS
RachelBotsman_2010X@308.25:310.04 WHERE DID THIS IDEA COME FROM
RachelBotsman_2010X@315.65:319.08 ACTUALLY IT WAS A COMPLICATED WEB OF SEEMINGLY DISCONNECTED
RachelBotsman_2010X@322.03:326.68 SEE A BIT LIKE A CONCEPTUAL FIREWORKS DISPLAY OF ALL THE DOTS THAT WENT ON IN MY HEAD
RachelBotsman_2010X@352.10:356.79 YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LEARN A NEW WORD AND THEN YOU START TO SEE THAT WORD EVERYWHERE THAT'S
RachelBotsman_2010X@357.15:362.29 TO ME WHEN I NOTICED THAT WE ARE MOVING FROM PASSIVE
RachelBotsman_2010X@364.61:366.73 TO HIGHLY ENABLED COLLABORATORS
RachelBotsman_2010X@368.19:371.36 HAPPENING IS THE INTERNET IS REMOVING THE MIDDLEMAN
RachelBotsman_2010X@371.81:376.61 SO THAT ANYONE FROM A T SHIRT DESIGNER TO A KNITTER CAN MAKE A LIVING SELLING
RachelBotsman_2010X@379.09:383.43 FORCE OF THIS PEER TO PEER REVOLUTION MEANS THAT SHARING IS HAPPENING AT
RachelBotsman_2010X@385.01:392.82 I MEAN IT'S AMAZING TO THINK THAT IN EVERY SINGLE MINUTE OF THIS SPEECH TWENTY FIVE HOURS OF YOUTUBE VIDEO
RachelBotsman_2010X@394.65:400.81 NOW WHAT I FIND FASCINATING ABOUT THESE EXAMPLES IS HOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY TAPPING IN TO OUR PRIMATE INSTINCTS
RachelBotsman_2010X@401.30:409.13 I MEAN WE'RE MONKEYS AND WE'RE BORN AND BRED TO SHARE AND COOPERATE AND WERE DOING SO FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS WHETHER IT'S
RachelBotsman_2010X@414.55:419.36 SYSTEM CALLED HYPER CONSUMPTION CAME ALONG AND WE BUILT THESE FENCES AND CREATED OUT
RachelBotsman_2010X@421.05:422.40 BUT THINGS ARE CHANGING
RachelBotsman_2010X@422.93:426.45 AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY ARE THE DIGITAL NATIVES OR
RachelBotsman_2010X@442.33:447.80 THE REASON WHY IT'S HAPPENING SO FAST IS BECAUSE OF MOBILE COLLABORATION WE NOW LIVE IN A CONNECTED AGE
RachelBotsman_2010X@448.39:453.60 WHERE WE CAN LOCATE ANYONE ANYTIME IN REAL TIME FROM A SMALL DEVICE IN OUR HANDS
RachelBotsman_2010X@454.84:460.26 THIS WAS GOING THROUGH MY HEAD TOWARDS THE END OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WHEN OF COURSE THE GREAT FINANCIAL CRASH
RachelBotsman_2010X@475.11:485.02 NOW WE RATIONALLY KNOW THAT AN ECONOMY BUILT ON HYPER CONSUMPTION IS A PONZI SCHEME IT'S A HOUSE OF CARDS YET IT'S HARD FOR US TO INDIVIDUALLY KNOW WHAT TO
RachelBotsman_2010X@486.33:500.89 SO ALL OF THIS IS A LOT OF TWITTERING RIGHT WELL IT WAS A LOT OF NOISE AND COMPLEXITY IN MY HEAD UNTIL ACTUALLY I REALIZED IT WAS HAPPENING BECAUSE OF FOUR KEY DRIVERS ONE A RENEWED BELIEF IN THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY AND A VERY REDEFINITION OF WHAT FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR REALLY MEANS
RachelBotsman_2010X@501.37:508.58 A TORRENT OF PEER TO PEER SOCIAL NETWORKS AND REAL TIME TECHNOLOGIES FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING THE WAY WE BEHAVE THREE
RachelBotsman_2010X@513.14:516.91 GLOBAL RECESSION THAT HAS FUNDAMENTALLY SHOCKED CONSUMER BEHAVIORS
RachelBotsman_2010X@533.72:544.44 AN INFLECTION POINT WHERE THE SHARING BEHAVIORS THROUGH SITES SUCH AS FLICKR AND TWITTER THAT ARE BECOMING SECOND NATURE ONLINE ARE BEING APPLIED TO OFFLINE AREAS OF OUR EVERYDAY LIVES
RachelBotsman_2010X@555.83:561.88 MY CO AUTHOR ROO ROGERS AND I HAVE ACTUALLY GATHERED THOUSANDS OF EXAMPLES FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD OF COLLABORATIVE CONSUMPTION
RachelBotsman_2010X@562.16:570.97 AND ALTHOUGH THEY VARY ENORMOUSLY IN SCALE MATURITY AND PURPOSE WHEN WE DIVED INTO THEM WE REALIZED THAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY BE ORGANIZED INTO THREE CLEAR SYSTEMS
RachelBotsman_2010X@571.21:583.25 THE FIRST IS REDISTRIBUTION MARKETS REDISTRIBUTION MARKETS JUST LIKE SWAPTREE IS WHEN YOU TAKE A USED OR PRE OWNED ITEM AND MOVE IT FROM WHERE IT'S NOT NEEDED TO SOMEWHERE OR SOMEONE WHERE IT IS
RachelBotsman_2010X@584.59:593.50 THOUGHT OF AS THE FIFTH R REDUCE REUSE RECYCLE REPAIR AND REDISTRIBUTE BECAUSE THEY STRETCH THE LIFE CYCLE OF A PRODUCT AND THEREBY REDUCE WASTE
RachelBotsman_2010X@594.19:601.67 THE SECOND IS COLLABORATIVE LIFESTYLES THIS IS THE SHARING AND RESOURCES OF THINGS LIKE MONEY SKILLS AND TIME
RachelBotsman_2010X@602.76:608.28 IN A COUPLE OF YEARS THAT PHRASES LIKE COWORKING AND COUCH SURFING AND TIME
RachelBotsman_2010X@638.64:644.60 THIS IS WHERE YOU PAY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PRODUCT WHAT IT DOES FOR YOU WITHOUT NEEDING TO OWN THE PRODUCT OUTRIGHT
RachelBotsman_2010X@645.23:653.49 THIS IDEA IS PARTICULARLY POWERFUL FOR THINGS THAT HAVE HIGH IDLING CAPACITY AND THAT CAN BE ANYTHING FROM BABY
RachelBotsman_2010X@654.09:657.07 TO FASHIONS TO HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE A POWER DRILL
RachelBotsman_2010X@659.04:663.35 RIGHT THAT POWER DRILL WILL BE USED AROUND TWELVE TO THIRTEEN MINUTES IN
RachelBotsman_2010X@664.42:665.65 LIFETIME
RachelBotsman_2010X@666.73:670.56 IT'S KIND OF RIDICULOUS RIGHT BECAUSE WHAT YOU NEED IS THE HOLE NOT
RachelBotsman_2010X@695.88:705.95 I WANT TO JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF HOW POWERFUL COLLABORATIVE CONSUMPTION CAN BE TO CHANGE BEHAVIORS THE AVERAGE CAR COSTS DOLLAR EIGHT THOUSAND A YEAR TO RUN
RachelBotsman_2010X@708.19:710.36 FOR TWENTY THREE HOURS A DAY
RachelBotsman_2010X@710.88:716.33 SO WHEN YOU CONSIDER THESE TWO FACTS IT STARTS TO MAKE A LITTLE LESS SENSE THAT WE HAVE TO OWN ONE OUTRIGHT
RachelBotsman_2010X@717.38:720.87 SO THIS IS WHERE CAR SHARING COMPANIES SUCH AS ZIPCAR AND GOGET
RachelBotsman_2010X@722.33:728.19 IN IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE ZIPCAR TOOK TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PARTICIPANTS FROM ACROSS THIRTEEN CITIES
RachelBotsman_2010X@729.17:738.04 AND THEY'RE ALL SELF CONFESSED CAR ADDICTS AND CAR SHARING ROOKIES AND GOT THEM TO SURRENDER THEIR KEYS FOR A MONTH INSTEAD THESE PEOPLE HAD TO WALK BIKE
RachelBotsman_2010X@738.41:745.63 TAKE THE TRAIN OR OTHER FORMS OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT THEY COULD ONLY USE THEIR ZIPCAR MEMBERSHIP WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
RachelBotsman_2010X@746.10:755.71 THE RESULTS OF THIS CHALLENGE AFTER JUST ONE MONTH WE STAGGERING IT'S AMAZING THAT FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN LBS WERE LOST JUST FROM THE EXTRA EXERCISE
RachelBotsman_2010X@756.18:764.94 BUT MY FAVORITE STATISTIC IS THAT ONE HUNDRED OUT OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PARTICIPANTS DID NOT WANT THEIR KEYS BACK
RachelBotsman_2010X@765.59:768.57 IN OTHER WORDS THE CAR ADDICTS HAD LOST THEIR
RachelBotsman_2010X@780.68:790.51 A GREAT QUOTE THAT WAS WRITTEN IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT SAID SHARING IS TO OWNERSHIP WHAT THE IPOD IS TO THE EIGHT TRACK WHAT SOLAR POWER IS TO THE COAL MINE
RachelBotsman_2010X@791.80:794.21 I BELIEVE ALSO OUR GENERATION
RachelBotsman_2010X@794.85:805.10 OUR RELATIONSHIP TO SATISFYING WHAT WE WANT IS FAR LESS TANGIBLE THAN ANY OTHER PREVIOUS GENERATION I DON'T WANT THE DVD I WANT THE MOVIE IS CARRIES
RachelBotsman_2010X@805.24:814.08 I DON'T WANT A CLUNKY ANSWERING MACHINE I WANT THE MESSAGE IT SAVES I DON'T WANT A CD I WANT THE MUSIC IT PLAYS IN OTHER WORDS I DON'T WANT STUFF
RachelBotsman_2010X@814.94:817.22 THE NEEDS OR EXPERIENCES IT FULFILLS
RachelBotsman_2010X@818.02:827.63 THIS IS FUELING A MASSIVE SHIFT FROM WHERE USAGE TRUMPS POSSESSIONS OR AS KEVIN KELLY THE EDITOR OF WIRED MAGAZINE PUTS IT WHERE ACCESS IS BETTER THAN
RachelBotsman_2010X@829.21:837.31 NOW AS OUR POSSESSIONS DEMATERIALIZE INTO THE CLOUD A BLURRY LINE IS APPEARING BETWEEN WHAT'S MINE WHAT'S YOURS AND
RachelBotsman_2010X@838.79:842.89 I WANT TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE THAT SHOWS HOW FAST THIS EVOLUTION IS HAPPENING
RachelBotsman_2010X@843.95:848.65 THIS REPRESENTS AND EIGHT YEAR TIME SPAN WE'VE GONE FROM TRADITIONAL CAR
RachelBotsman_2010X@849.67:859.05 TO CAR SHARING COMPANIES SUCH AS ZIPCAR AND GOGET TO RIDE SHARING PLATFORMS THAT MATCH RIDES TO THE NEWEST ENTRY WHICH IS PEER TO PEER CAR RENTAL
RachelBotsman_2010X@859.33:865.26 WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY OUT OF RENTING THAT CAR THAT SITS IDLE FOR TWENTY THREE HOURS A DAY TO
RachelBotsman_2010X@867.16:870.17 NOW ALL OF THESE SYSTEMS REQUIRE A DEGREE OF TRUST
RachelBotsman_2010X@870.53:873.84 AND THE CORNERSTONE TO THIS WORKING IS REPUTATION
RachelBotsman_2010X@877.68:885.25 MUCH BECAUSE OUR CREDIT HISTORY WAS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAT ANY KIND OF PEER TO PEER REVIEW BUT NOW WITH THE WEB WE
RachelBotsman_2010X@889.40:895.77 WITH EVERY IDEA WE POST COMMENT WE SHARE WE'RE ACTUALLY SIGNALING HOW WELL WE COLLABORATE AND WHETHER WE CAN
RachelBotsman_2010X@898.45:899.96 MY FIRST EXAMPLE
RachelBotsman_2010X@901.70:911.79 I CAN SEE THAT RONDORON HAS COMPLETED FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE TRADES WITH A HUNDRED PERCENT SUCCESS RATE IN OTHER WORDS I CAN TRUST HIM OR HER
RachelBotsman_2010X@913.61:918.11 NOW MARK MY WORDS IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
RachelBotsman_2010X@920.52:929.71 AND SEE A CUMULATIVE PICTURE OF OUR REPUTATION CAPITAL AND THIS REPUTATION CAPITAL WILL DETERMINE OUR ACCESS TO COLLABORATIVE CONSUMPTION
RachelBotsman_2010X@930.43:935.04 IT'S A NEW SOCIAL CURRENCY SO TO SPEAK THAT COULD BECOME AS POWERFUL AS OUR CREDIT RATING
RachelBotsman_2010X@935.91:942.24 NOW AS A CLOSING THOUGHT I BELIEVE WE'RE ACTUALLY IN A PERIOD WHERE WE'RE WAKING UP
RachelBotsman_2010X@942.75:946.08 FROM THIS HUMONGOUS HANGOVER OF EMPTINESS AND
RachelBotsman_2010X@947.18:954.32 AND WE'RE TAKING A LEAP TO CREATE A MORE SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM BUILT TO SERVE OUR INNATE NEEDS FOR COMMUNITY AND INDIVIDUAL
RachelBotsman_2010X@955.40:961.85 I BELIEVE IT WILL BE REFERRED TO AS A REVOLUTION SO TO SPEAK WHEN SOCIETY FACED WITH GREAT CHALLENGES
RachelBotsman_2010X@962.85:967.58 MADE A SEISMIC SHIFT FROM INDIVIDUAL GETTING AND SPENDING TOWARDS A REDISCOVERY
RachelBotsman_2010X@969.41:978.77 I'M ON A MISSION TO MAKE SHARING COOL I'M ON A MISSION TO MAKE SHARING HIP BECAUSE I REALLY BELIEVE IT CAN DISRUPT OUTDATED MODES OF BUSINESS
RachelBotsman_2010X@979.10:986.49 HELP US LEAPFROG OVER WASTEFUL FORMS OF HYPER CONSUMPTION AND TEACH US WHEN ENOUGH REALLY IS ENOUGH THANK YOU
