DanielLibeskind_2009 MY FAVORITE MUSE EMILY DICKINSON WHO SAID
DanielLibeskind_2009 IS NOT KNOWLEDGE NEITHER IS IT IGNORANCE IT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS SUSPENDED BETWEEN WHAT WE BELIEVE WE CAN BE AND A TRADITION WE MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN
DanielLibeskind_2009 AND I THINK WHEN I LISTEN TO THESE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE HERE I'VE BEEN SO INSPIRED SO MANY INCREDIBLE IDEAS SO MANY VISIONS AND YET WHEN I LOOK AT THE ENVIRONMENT OUTSIDE
DanielLibeskind_2009 YOU SEE HOW RESISTANT ARCHITECTURE IS TO CHANGE YOU SEE HOW RESISTANT IT IS TO THOSE VERY IDEAS WE CAN THINK THEM OUT WE CAN CREATE INCREDIBLE THINGS
DanielLibeskind_2009 AND YET AT THE THE END IT'S SO HARD TO CHANGE A WALL WE APPLAUD THE WELL MANNERED BOX BUT TO CREATE A SPACE THAT NEVER EXISTED IS WHAT INTERESTS ME TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER BEEN
DanielLibeskind_2009 A SPACE THAT WE HAVE NEVER ENTERED EXCEPT IN OUR MINDS AND OUR SPIRITS AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT ARCHITECTURE IS BASED ON ARCHITECTURE IS NOT BASED ON CONCRETE AND STEEL AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE SOIL IT'S BASED ON WONDER
DanielLibeskind_2009 AND THAT WONDER IS REALLY WHAT HAS CREATED THE GREATEST CITIES THE GREATEST SPACES THAT WE HAVE HAD AND I THINK THAT IS INDEED WHAT ARCHITECTURE IS IT IS A STORY
DanielLibeskind_2009 BY THE WAY IT IS A STORY THAT IS TOLD THROUGH ITS HARD MATERIALS BUT IT IS A STORY OF EFFORT AND STRUGGLE
DanielLibeskind_2009 YOU THINK OF HOW INCREDIBLE THIS IS THAT THAT WAS REALIZED NOT BY SOME ABSTRACT IDEA BUT BY PEOPLE SO ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN MADE CAN BE UNMADE ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN MADE CAN BE MADE BETTER
DanielLibeskind_2009 THERE IT IS THE THINGS THAT I REALLY BELIEVE ARE ARE OF IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURE THESE ARE THE DIMENSIONS THAT I LIKE TO WORK WITH IT'S SOMETHING VERY PERSONAL IT'S NOT PERHAPS THE DIMENSIONS APPRECIATED BY ART CRITICS OR ARCHITECTURE CRITICS OR CITY PLANNERS BUT I THINK THESE ARE THE NECESSARY
DanielLibeskind_2009 OXYGEN FOR US TO LIVE IN BUILDINGS TO LIVE IN CITIES TO CONNECT OURSELVES IN A SOCIAL SPACE AND I THEREFORE BELIEVE THAT OPTIMISM IS WHAT DRIVES ARCHITECTURE FORWARD IT'S THE ONLY PROFESSION
DanielLibeskind_2009 WHERE YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN THE FUTURE YOU CAN BE AN GENERAL A POLITICIAN AN ECONOMIST WHO IS DEPRESSED A MUSICIAN IN A MINOR KEY A PAINTER IN DARK COLORS BUT ARCHITECTURE IS THAT
DanielLibeskind_2009 COMPLETE ECSTASY THAT THE FUTURE CAN BE BETTER AND IT IS THAT BELIEF THAT I THINK DRIVES SOCIETY AND TODAY WE HAVE A KIND OF EVANGELICAL PESSIMISM ALL AROUND US AND YET IT IS IN TIMES LIKE THIS
DanielLibeskind_2009 THAT I THINK ARCHITECTURE CAN THRIVE WITH BIG IDEAS IDEAS THAT ARE NOT SMALL THINK OF THE GREAT CITIES THINK OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING THE ROCKEFELLER CENTER THEY WERE BUILT IN TIMES
DanielLibeskind_2009 NOT REALLY THE BEST OF TIMES IN A CERTAIN WAY AND YET THAT ENERGY AND POWER OF ARCHITECTURE HAS DRIVEN AN ENTIRE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SPACE
DanielLibeskind_2009 THAT THESE BUILDINGS OCCUPY SO AGAIN I AM A BELIEVER IN THE EXPRESSIVE I HAVE NEVER BEEN A FAN OF THE NEUTRAL I DON'T LIKE NEUTRALITY IN LIFE IN ANYTHING
DanielLibeskind_2009 I THINK EXPRESSION AND IT'S LIKE ESPRESSO COFFEE YOU KNOW YOU TAKE THE ESSENCE OF THE COFFEE THAT'S WHAT EXPRESSION IS IT'S BEEN MISSING IN MUCH OF THE ARCHITECTURE BECAUSE WE THINK ARCHITECTURE IS THE REALM OF THE
DanielLibeskind_2009 THE REALM OF THE KIND OF A STATE THAT HAS NO OPINION THAT HAS NO VALUE AND YET I BELIEVE IT IS THE EXPRESSION EXPRESSION OF THE CITY EXPRESSION OF OUR OWN SPACE
DanielLibeskind_2009 THAT GIVES MEANING TO ARCHITECTURE AND OF COURSE EXPRESSIVE SPACES ARE NOT MUTE EXPRESSIVE SPACES ARE NOT SPACES THAT SIMPLY CONFIRM WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW
DanielLibeskind_2009 EXPRESSIVE SPACES MAY DISTURB US AND I THINK THAT'S ALSO PART OF LIFE LIFE IS NOT JUST AN ANESTHETIC TO MAKE US SMILE BUT TO REACH OUT ACROSS THE ABYSS OF HISTORY TO PLACES WE HAVE NEVER BEEN AND
DanielLibeskind_2009 WOULD HAVE PERHAPS BEEN HAD WE NOT BEEN SO LUCKY SO AGAIN RADICAL VERSUS CONSERVATIVE RADICAL WHAT DOES IT MEAN IT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS ROOTED
DanielLibeskind_2009 CONNECTION TO THE COSMIC EVENT THAT WE ARE PART OF AND A STORY THAT IS CERTAINLY ONGOING IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS A GOOD ENDING OR A BAD ENDING IT'S ACTUALLY A STORY
DanielLibeskind_2009 IN WHICH OUR ACTS THEMSELVES ARE PUSHING THE STORY IN A PARTICULAR WAY SO AGAIN I AM A BELIEVER IN THE RADICAL ARCHITECTURE YOU KNOW THE SOVIET ARCHITECTURE OF THE THAT BUILDING IS THE CONSERVATION
DanielLibeskind_2009 IT'S LIKE THE OLD LAS VEGAS USED TO BE IT'S ABOUT CONSERVING EMOTIONS CONSERVING THE TRADITIONS THAT HAVE OBSTRUCTED THE MIND IN MOVING FORWARD AND OF COURSE WHAT IS RADICAL IS TO CONFRONT THEM AND I THINK OUR ARCHITECTURE IS A CONFRONTATION WITH OUR OWN
DanielLibeskind_2009 I THINK EMOTION IS A DIMENSION THAT IS IMPORTANT TO INTRODUCE INTO CITY SPACE INTO CITY LIFE AND OF COURSE WE ARE ALL ABOUT THE STRUGGLE OF EMOTIONS AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT MAKES THE WORLD A WONDROUS PLACE
DanielLibeskind_2009 AND OF COURSE THE CONFRONTATION OF THE COOL THE UNEMOTIONAL WITH EMOTION IS A CONVERSATION THAT I THINK CITIES THEMSELVES HAVE FOSTERED I THINK THAT IS THE PROGRESS OF CITIES IT'S NOT ONLY THE FORMS OF CITIES
DanielLibeskind_2009 BUT THE FACT THAT THEY INCARNATE EMOTIONS NOT JUST OF THOSE WHO BUILD THEM BUT OF THOSE WHO LIVE THERE AS WELL INEXPLICABLE VERSUS UNDERSTOOD YOU KNOW TOO OFTEN WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING BUT ARCHITECTURE IS NOT
DanielLibeskind_2009 THE LANGUAGE OF WORDS IT'S A LANGUAGE BUT IT IS NOT A LANGUAGE THAT CAN BE REDUCED TO A SERIES OF PROGRAMATIC NOTES THAT WE CAN
DanielLibeskind_2009 TOO MANY BUILDINGS THAT YOU SEE OUTSIDE THAT ARE SO BANAL TELL YOU A STORY BUT THE STORY IS VERY SHORT WHICH SAYS WE HAVE NO STORY TO TELL YOU
DanielLibeskind_2009 IS TO INTRODUCE THE ACTUAL ARCHITECTURAL DIMENSIONS WHICH MIGHT BE TOTALLY INEXPLICABLE IN WORDS BECAUSE THEY OPERATE IN PROPORTIONS
DanielLibeskind_2009 IN MATERIALS IN LIGHT THEY CONNECT THEMSELVES INTO VARIOUS SOURCES INTO A KIND OF COMPLEX VECTOR MATRIX THAT
DanielLibeskind_2009 ISN'T REALLY FRONTAL BUT IS REALLY EMBEDDED IN THE LIVES AND IN THE HISTORY OF A CITY AND OF A PEOPLE SO AGAIN THE NOTION THAT A BUILDING SHOULD JUST BE EXPLICIT
DanielLibeskind_2009 I THINK IS A FALSE NOTION WHICH HAS REDUCED ARCHITECTURE INTO BANALITY HAND VERSUS THE COMPUTER OF COURSE WHAT WOULD WE BE WITHOUT COMPUTERS
DanielLibeskind_2009 OUR WHOLE PRACTICE DEPENDS ON COMPUTING BUT THE COMPUTER SHOULD NOT JUST BE THE GLOVE OF THE HAND THE HAND SHOULD REALLY BE
DanielLibeskind_2009 DRIVER OF THE COMPUTING POWER BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE HAND IN ALL ITS PRIMITIVE IN ALL ITS PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSCURITY
DanielLibeskind_2009 A SOURCE THOUGH THE SOURCE IS UNKNOWN THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE TO BE MYSTICAL ABOUT IT WE REALIZE THAT THE HAND HAS BEEN GIVEN US BY
DanielLibeskind_2009 FORCES THAT ARE BEYOND OUR OWN AUTONOMY AND I THINK WHEN I DRAW DRAWINGS WHICH MAY IMITATE THE COMPUTER BUT ARE NOT COMPUTER DRAWINGS DRAWINGS THAT CAN COME FROM SOURCES
DanielLibeskind_2009 THAT ARE COMPLETELY NOT KNOWN NOT NORMAL NOT SEEN YET THE HAND AND THAT'S WHAT I REALLY TO ALL OF YOU WHO ARE WORKING HOW CAN WE MAKE THE COMPUTER
DanielLibeskind_2009 HAND RATHER THAN THE HAND RESPONDING TO THE COMPUTER I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE COMPLEXITY OF ARCHITECTURE IS BECAUSE
DanielLibeskind_2009 CERTAINLY WE HAVE GOTTEN USED TO THE PROPAGANDA THAT THE SIMPLE IS THE GOOD BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT LISTENING TO ALL OF YOU THE COMPLEXITY OF THOUGHT THE COMPLEXITY OF LAYERS OF MEANING IS OVERWHELMING AND I THINK
DanielLibeskind_2009 SHY AWAY IN ARCHITECTURE YOU KNOW BRAIN SURGERY ATOMIC THEORY GENETICS ECONOMICS ARE COMPLEX COMPLEX FIELDS
DanielLibeskind_2009 AND AS WONDROUS AS IT IS IT CAN NOT BE REDUCED TO A KIND OF SIMPLIFICATION THAT WE HAVE OFTEN COME TO BE ADMIRED AND YET
DanielLibeskind_2009 OUR LIVES ARE COMPLEX OUR EMOTIONS ARE COMPLEX OUR INTELLECTUAL DESIRES ARE COMPLEX SO I DO BELIEVE THAT ARCHITECTURE AS I SEE IT
DanielLibeskind_2009 NEEDS TO MIRROR THAT COMPLEXITY IN EVERY SINGLE SPACE THAT WE HAVE IN EVERY INTIMACY THAT WE POSSES OF COURSE THAT MEANS THAT ARCHITECTURE IS POLITICAL THE POLITICAL IS NOT AN ENEMY OF ARCHITECTURE THE IS THE CITY IT'S ALL OF US TOGETHER
DanielLibeskind_2009 AND I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE ACT OF ARCHITECTURE EVEN A PRIVATE HOUSE WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE WILL SEE IT IS A POLITICAL ACT BECAUSE IT WILL BE VISIBLE TO OTHERS AND WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHICH IS CONNECTING US MORE AND MORE SO
DanielLibeskind_2009 AGAIN THE EVASION OF THAT SPHERE WHICH HAS BEEN SO ENDEMIC TO THAT THAT SORT OF PURE ARCHITECTURE THE AUTONOMOUS ARCHITECTURE THAT IS JUST AN ABSTRACT OBJECT HAS NEVER APPEALED TO ME AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS INTERACTION WITH THE HISTORY
DanielLibeskind_2009 WITH HISTORY THAT IS OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT TO GRAPPLE WITH IT TO CREATE A POSITION THAT IS BEYOND OUR NORMAL EXPECTATIONS
DanielLibeskind_2009 AND TO CREATE A CRITIQUE BECAUSE ARCHITECTURE IS ALSO THE ASKING OF QUESTIONS IT'S NOT ONLY THE GIVING OF ANSWERS IT'S ALSO JUST LIKE LIFE THE ASKING OF QUESTIONS THEREFORE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IT BE REAL
DanielLibeskind_2009 WE CAN SIMULATE ALMOST ANYTHING BUT THE ONE THING THAT CAN BE EVER SIMULATED IS THE HUMAN HEART THE HUMAN SOUL AND ARCHITECTURE IS SO CLOSELY INTERTWINED WITH IT
DanielLibeskind_2009 IT'S THE REAL THAT WE TOUCH THE DOOR THE WINDOW THE THRESHOLD THE BED SUCH PROSAIC OBJECTS AND YET I TRY IN EVERY BUILDING TO TAKE THAT VIRTUAL WORLD WHICH IS SO ENIGMATIC AND SO RICH AND CREATE SOMETHING
DanielLibeskind_2009 IN THE REAL WORLD CREATE A SPACE FOR AN OFFICE A SPACE OF SUSTAINABILITY THAT REALLY WORKS BETWEEN THAT VIRTUALITY AND YET CAN BE REALIZED AS SOMETHING REAL
DanielLibeskind_2009 YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE THE CATHEDRALS AS UNEXPECTED WILL ALWAYS BE UNEXPECTED YOU KNOW FRANK GEHRY 'S BUILDINGS THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE UNEXPECTED IN THE FUTURE SO
DanielLibeskind_2009 NOT THE HABITUAL ARCHITECTURE THAT INSTILLS IN US THE FALSE SORT OF STABILITY BUT AN ARCHITECTURE THAT IS FULL OF TENSION
DanielLibeskind_2009 AN ARCHITECTURE THAT GOES BEYOND ITSELF TO REACH A HUMAN SOUL AND A HUMAN HEART AND THAT BREAKS OUT OF THE SHACKLES OF HABITS
DanielLibeskind_2009 AND OF COURSE HABITS ARE ENFORCED BY ARCHITECTURE WHEN WE SEE THE SAME KIND OF ARCHITECTURE WE BECOME INURED IN THAT WORLD OF THOSE ANGLES OF THOSE LIGHTS OF THOSE MATERIALS WE THINK THE WORLD
DanielLibeskind_2009 LOOKS LIKE OUR BUILDINGS AND YET OUR BUILDINGS ARE PRETTY MUCH LIMITED BY THE TECHNIQUES AND WONDERS THAT HAVE BEEN PART OF THEM SO AGAIN THE UNEXPECTED WHICH IS ALSO THE RAW AND I OFTEN THINK OF THE RAW AND THE REFINED WHAT IS RAW THE RAW I WOULD SAY
DanielLibeskind_2009 IS THE NAKED EXPERIENCE UNTOUCHED BY LUXURY UNTOUCHED BY EXPENSIVE MATERIALS UNTOUCHED BY THE KIND OF REFINEMENT THAT WE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH CULTURE SO THE RAWNESS I THINK
DanielLibeskind_2009 IN SPACE THE FACT THAT SUSTAINABILITY CAN ACTUALLY IN THE FUTURE TRANSLATE INTO A RAW SPACE A SPACE THAT ISN'T DECORATED A SPACE THAT IS NOT
DanielLibeskind_2009 MANNERED IN ANY SOURCE BUT A SPACE THAT MIGHT BE COOL IN TERMS OF ITS TEMPERATURE MIGHT BE REFRACTIVE TO OUR DESIRES A SPACE
DanielLibeskind_2009 DOESN'T ALWAYS FOLLOW US LIKE A DOG THAT HAS BEEN TRAINED TO FOLLOW US BUT MOVES AHEAD INTO DIRECTIONS OF DEMONSTRATING OTHER POSSIBILITIES OTHER EXPERIENCES
DanielLibeskind_2009 THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN PART OF THE VOCABULARY OF ARCHITECTURE AND OF COURSE THAT JUXTAPOSTION IS OF GREAT INTEREST TO ME BECAUSE IT CREATES A KIND OF A SPARK OF NEW ENERGY
DanielLibeskind_2009 AND SO I DO LIKE SOMETHING WHICH IS POINTED NOT BLUNT SOMETHING WHICH IS FOCUSED ON REALITY SOMETHING THAT
DanielLibeskind_2009 HAS THE POWER THROUGH ITS LEVERAGE TO TRANSFORM EVEN A VERY SMALL SPACE SO ARCHITECTURE MAYBE IS NOT SO BIG LIKE SCIENCE BUT
DanielLibeskind_2009 THROUGH ITS FOCAL POINT IT CAN LEVERAGE IN AN ARCHEMEDIAN WAY WHAT WE THINK THE WORLD IS REALLY ABOUT AND OFTEN IT TAKES JUST A BUILDING TO CHANGE OUR EXPERIENCE OF WHAT COULD BE DONE WHAT HAS BEEN DONE HOW THE WORLD
DanielLibeskind_2009 HAS REMAINED BOTH INBETWEEN STABILITY AND INSTABILITY AND OF COURSE BUILDINGS HAVE THEIR SHAPES THOSE SHAPES ARE DIFFICULT TO CHANGE AND YET I DO BELIEVE IN EVERY SOCIAL SPACE IN EVERY PUBLIC SPACE
DanielLibeskind_2009 THERE IS A DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE MORE THAN JUST THAT BLUNT THOUGHT THAT BLUNT TECHNIQUE BUT SOMETHING THAT PINPOINTS AND CAN POINT IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS FORWARD BACKWARD SIDEWAYS AND AROUND SO
DanielLibeskind_2009 THAT IS INDEED A MEMORY SO I BELIEVE THAT MY MAIN INTEREST IS TO MEMORY
DanielLibeskind_2009 WITHOUT MEMORY WE WOULD BE AMNESIACS WE WOULD NOT KNOW WHICH WAY WE WERE GOING AND WHY WE ARE GOING WHERE WE'RE GOING SO I'VE BEEN NEVER INTERESTED IN THE FORGETTABLE
DanielLibeskind_2009 REUSE REHASHING OF THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHICH OF COURSE GET ACCOLADES OF CRITICS CRITICS LIKE THE PERFORMANCE TO BE REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN THE SAME WAY BUT I RATHER PLAY SOMETHING
DanielLibeskind_2009 AGAIN MEMORY IS THE CITY MEMORY IS THE WORLD WITHOUT THE MEMORY THERE WOULD BE NO STORY TO TELL THERE WOULD BE NOWHERE TO TURN
DanielLibeskind_2009 THE MEMORABLE I THINK IS REALLY OUR WORLD WHAT WE THINK THE WORLD IS AND IT'S NOT ONLY OUR MEMORY BUT THOSE WHO REMEMBER US WHICH MEANS THAT ARCHITECTURE IS NOT
DanielLibeskind_2009 IT'S AN ART OF COMMUNICATION IT TELLS A STORY THE STORY CAN REACH INTO OBSCURE DESIRES IT CAN REACH INTO SOURCES THAT ARE NOT EXPLICITLY AVAILABLE IT CAN REACH INTO MILLENIA THAT HAVE BEEN BURIED
DanielLibeskind_2009 AND RETURN THEM IN A JUST AND UNEXPECTED EQUITY SO AGAIN I THINK THE NOTION THAT THE BEST ARCHITECTURE IS SILENT
DanielLibeskind_2009 ARCHITECTURAL MISSION THAT I BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT IS TO CREATE SPACES THAT ARE VIBRANT THAT ARE PLURALISTIC THAT CAN TRANSFORM THE MOST PROSAIC ACTIVITIES
DanielLibeskind_2009 AND RAISE THEM TO A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EXPECTATION CREATE A SHOPPING CENTER A SWIMMING PLACE THAT IS MORE LIKE A MUSEUM THAN LIKE ENTERTAINMENT AND THESE ARE OUR DREAMS AND OF COURSE RISK
DanielLibeskind_2009 I THINK ARCHITECTURE SHOULD BE RISKY YOU KNOW IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY AND SO ON BUT YES IT SHOULD NOT PLAY IT SAFE IT SHOULD NOT PLAY IT SAFE BECAUSE IF IT PLAYS IT SAFE
DanielLibeskind_2009 IT'S NOT MOVING US IN A DIRECTION THAT WE WANT TO BE AND I THINK OF COURSE RISK IS WHAT UNDERLIES THE WORLD WORLD WITHOUT RISK WOULD NOT BE WORTH LIVING
DanielLibeskind_2009 SO YES I DO BELIEVE THAT THE RISK WE TAKE IN EVERY BUILDING RISKS TO CREATE SPACES THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN CANTILEVERED TO THAT EXTENT RISKS OF SPACES THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN SO
DanielLibeskind_2009 AS THEY SHOULD BE FOR A PIONEERING CITY RISKS THAT REALLY MOVE ARCHITECTURE EVEN WITH ALL IT'S FLAWS INTO A SPACE WHICH IS MUCH BETTER THAT THE EVER AGAIN REPEATED HOLLOWNESS
DanielLibeskind_2009 A READY MADE THING AND OF COURSE THAT IS FINALLY WHAT I BELIEVE ARCHITECTURE TO BE IT'S ABOUT SPACE IT'S NOT ABOUT FASHION IT'S NOT ABOUT DECORATION IT'S ABOUT CREATING WITH MINIMAL MEANS SOMETHING WHICH
DanielLibeskind_2009 BE REPEATED CAN NOT BE SIMULATED IN ANY OTHER SPHERE AND THERE OF COURSE IS THE SPACE THAT WE NEED TO BREATHE IS THE SPACE WE NEED TO DREAM
DanielLibeskind_2009 THESE ARE THE SPACES THAT ARE NOT JUST LUXURIOUS SPACES FOR SOME OF US BUT ARE IMPORTANT FOR EVERYBODY IN THIS WORLD SO AGAIN
DanielLibeskind_2009 IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CHANGING FASHIONS CHANGING THEORIES IT'S ABOUT CARVING OUT A SPACE FOR TREES IT'S CARVING OUT A SPACE WHERE NATURE CAN ENTER THE DOMESTIC WORLD OF A CITY
DanielLibeskind_2009 A SPACE WHERE SOMETHING WHICH HAS NEVER SEEN A LIGHT OF DAY CAN ENTER INTO THE INNERWORKINGS OF A DENSITY AND I THINK THAT IS REALLY THE NATURE OF ARCHITECTURE NOW
DanielLibeskind_2009 I AM A BELIEVER IN DEMOCRACY I DON'T LIKE BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS BUILT FOR TOTALITARIAN REGIMES WHERE PEOPLE CAN NOT SPEAK CAN NOT VOTE CAN NOT DO ANYTHING WE TOO OFTEN ADMIRE THOSE BUILDINGS
DanielLibeskind_2009 WE THINK THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL AND YET WHEN I THINK OF THE POVERTY OF SOCIETY WHICH DOESN'T GIVE FREEDOM TO ITS PEOPLE I DON'T ADMIRE THOSE BUILDINGS SO DEMOCRACY AS DIFFICULT AS IT IS
DanielLibeskind_2009 I BELIEVE IN IT AND OF COURSE AT GROUND ZERO WHAT ELSE IT'S SUCH A COMPLEX PROJECT IT'S EMOTIONAL THERE IS SO MANY INTERESTS IT'S POLITICAL
DanielLibeskind_2009 SO MANY PARTIES TO THIS PROJECT THERE IS SO MANY INTERESTS THERE'S MONEY THERE'S POLITICAL POWER THERE ARE EMOTIONS OF THE VICTIMS AND YET IN ALL ITS MESSINESS
DanielLibeskind_2009 IN ALL ITS DIFFICULTIES I WOULD NOT HAVE LIKED SOMEBODY TO SAY THIS IS THE TABLUA RASA MISTER ARCHITECT DO WHATEVER YOU WANT I THINK NOTHING GOOD WILL COME OUT OF THAT I THINK ARCHITECTURE IS ABOUT CONSENSUS AND IT IS ABOUT THE DIRTY WORD COMPROMISE COMPROMISE IS NOT BAD
DanielLibeskind_2009 TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN FREEDOM TOWER THE MEMORIAL AND THAT IS WHERE I END I WAS INSPIRED WHEN I CAME HERE AS AN IMMIGRANT ON A SHIP LIKE MILLIONS OF OTHERS LOOKING AT AMERICA FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW
DanielLibeskind_2009 YOU COME TO PEACE WITH THE PROCESS THAT HAPPENED AT GROUND ZERO AND THE LOSS OF THE ORIGINAL INCREDIBLE DESIGN THAT YOU CAME UP WITH
DanielLibeskind_2009 WE HAVE TO CURE OURSELVES OF THE NOTION THAT WE ARE AUTHORITARIAN THAT WE CAN DETERMINE EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS WE HAVE TO RELY ON OTHERS AND SHAPE THE PROCESS IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE
DanielLibeskind_2009 I CAME FROM THE BRONX I WAS TAUGHT NOT TO BE A LOSER NOT TO BE SOMEBODY WHO JUST GIVES UP IN A FIGHT YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE YOU DON'T ALWAYS WIN EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO WIN
