BrianCox_2009U@13.16:23.36 LAST YEAR AT TED I GAVE AN INTRODUCTION TO THE LHC AND I PROMISED TO COME BACK AND GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON HOW THAT MACHINE WORKS SO THIS IS IT AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WEREN 'T THERE THE LHC IS
BrianCox_2009U@23.36:39.11 THE LARGEST SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT EVER ATTEMPTED TWENTY SEVEN KILOMETERS IN CIRCUMFERENCE ITS JOB IS TO RECREATE THE CONDITIONS THAT WERE PRESENT LESS THAN A BILLIONTH OF A SECOND AFTER THE UNIVERSE BEGAN UP TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION TIMES A SECOND IT 'S NOTHING IF NOT AMBITIOUS THIS IS THE MACHINE BELOW GENEVA
BrianCox_2009U@39.11:48.14 WE TAKE THE PICTURES OF THOSE MINI BIG BANGS INSIDE DETECTORS THIS IS THE ONE I WORK ON IT 'S CALLED THE ATLAS DETECTOR FORTY FOUR METERS WIDE TWENTY TWO METERS IN DIAMETER
BrianCox_2009U@48.14:56.84 SPECTACULAR PICTURE HERE OF ATLAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION SO YOU CAN SEE THE SCALE ON THE TENTH OF SEPTEMBER LAST YEAR WE TURNED THE MACHINE ON FOR THE FIRST TIME
BrianCox_2009U@56.84:66.45 AND THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN BY ATLAS IT CAUSED IMMENSE CELEBRATION IN THE CONTROL ROOM IT 'S A PICTURE OF THE FIRST BEAM PARTICLE GOING ALL THE WAY AROUND THE LHC
BrianCox_2009U@66.45:77.14 COLLIDING WITH A PIECE OF THE LHC DELIBERATELY AND SHOWERING PARTICLES INTO THE DETECTOR IN OTHER WORDS WHEN WE SAW THAT PICTURE ON SEPTEMBER TENTH WE KNEW THE MACHINE WORKED WHICH IS A GREAT TRIUMPH
BrianCox_2009U@77.14:90.54 I DON 'T KNOW WHETHER THIS GOT THE BIGGEST CHEER OR THIS WHEN SOMEONE WENT ONTO GOOGLE AND SAW THE FRONT PAGE WAS LIKE THAT IT MEANS WE MADE CULTURAL IMPACT AS WELL AS SCIENTIFIC IMPACT ABOUT A WEEK LATER WE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE MACHINE
BrianCox_2009U@90.54:103.47 RELATED ACTUALLY TO THESE BITS OF WIRE HERE THESE GOLD WIRES THOSE WIRES CARRY THIRTEEN THOUSAND AMPS WHEN THE MACHINE IS WORKING IN FULL POWER NOW THE ENGINEERS AMONGST YOU WILL LOOK AT THEM AND SAY NO THEY DON 'T THEY 'RE SMALL WIRES
BrianCox_2009U@103.47:114.28 THEY CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WHEN THEY ARE VERY COLD THEY ARE WHAT 'S CALLED SUPERCONDUCTING WIRE SO AT MINUS TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE DEGREES COLDER THAN THE SPACE BETWEEN THE STARS THOSE WIRES CAN TAKE THAT CURRENT
BrianCox_2009U@114.28:129.16 IN ONE OF THE JOINTS BETWEEN OVER NINE THOUSAND MAGNETS IN LHC THERE WAS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT SO THE WIRE HEATED UP SLIGHTLY AND ITS THIRTEEN THOUSAND AMPS SUDDENLY ENCOUNTERED ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE THIS WAS THE RESULT
BrianCox_2009U@129.16:137.25 NOW THAT 'S MORE IMPRESSIVE WHEN YOU CONSIDER THOSE MAGNETS WEIGH OVER TWENTY TONS AND THEY MOVED ABOUT A FOOT SO WE DAMAGED ABOUT
BrianCox_2009U@137.25:152.55 FIFTY OF THE MAGNETS WE HAD TO TAKE THEM OUT WHICH WE DID WE RECONDITIONED THEM ALL FIXED THEM THEY 'RE ALL ON THEIR WAY BACK UNDERGROUND NOW BY THE END OF MARCH THE LHC WILL BE INTACT AGAIN WE WILL SWITCH IT ON AND WE EXPECT TO TAKE DATA IN JUNE OR JULY
BrianCox_2009U@152.55:166.91 AND CONTINUE WITH OUR QUEST TO FIND OUT WHAT THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE UNIVERSE ARE NOW OF COURSE IN A WAY THOSE ACCIDENTS REIGNITE THE DEBATE ABOUT THE VALUE OF SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING AT THE EDGE
BrianCox_2009U@166.91:174.22 IT 'S EASY TO REFUTE I THINK THAT THE FACT THAT IT 'S SO DIFFICULT THE FACT THAT WE 'RE OVERREACHING IS THE VALUE OF THINGS LIKE THE LHC
BrianCox_2009U@174.22:193.78 I WILL LEAVE THE FINAL WORD TO AN ENGLISH SCIENTIST HUMPHREY DAVY WHO I SUSPECT WHEN DEFENDING HIS PROTEGE 'S USELESS EXPERIMENTS HIS PROTEGE WAS MICHAEL FARADAY SAID THIS NOTHING IS SO DANGEROUS TO THE PROGRESS OF THE HUMAN MIND THAN TO ASSUME THAT OUR VIEWS OF SCIENCE ARE ULTIMATE
BrianCox_2009U@193.78:200.61 THAT THERE ARE NO MYSTERIES IN NATURE THAT OUR TRIUMPHS ARE COMPLETE AND THAT THERE ARE NO NEW WORLDS TO CONQUER
