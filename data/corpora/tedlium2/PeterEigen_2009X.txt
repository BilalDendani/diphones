PeterEigen_2009X@15.86:29.74 GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT CORRUPTION BUT I WOULD LIKE TO JUXTAPOSE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS ONE IS THE LARGE GLOBAL ECONOMY THE LARGE GLOBALIZED ECONOMY
PeterEigen_2009X@30.25:45.00 AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE SMALL AND VERY LIMITED CAPACITY OF OUR TRADITIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO GOVERN TO SHAPE THIS ECONOMY BECAUSE THERE IS THIS
PeterEigen_2009X@48.88:52.10 WHICH CREATES BASICALLY FAILING GOVERNANCE
PeterEigen_2009X@53.28:62.43 FAILING GOVERNANCE IN MANY AREAS IN THE AREA OF CORRUPTION AND THE AREA OF DESTRUCTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE AREA OF EXPLOITATION OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN
PeterEigen_2009X@62.92:77.02 IN THE AREA OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN ALL THE AREAS IN WHICH WE REALLY NEED A CAPACITY TO REINTRODUCE THE PRIMACY OF POLITICS
PeterEigen_2009X@78.57:85.81 THE ECONOMY WHICH IS OPERATING IN A WORLDWIDE ARENA AND I THINK CORRUPTION
PeterEigen_2009X@86.47:96.92 AND THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION AND THE IMPACT OF CORRUPTION IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING WAYS TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT I MEAN WITH THIS FAILURE OF GOVERNANCE
PeterEigen_2009X@98.86:101.23 TALK ABOUT MY OWN EXPERIENCE
PeterEigen_2009X@101.44:108.94 I USED TO WORK AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE WORLD BANK OFFICE IN NAIROBI FOR EAST AFRICA
PeterEigen_2009X@109.69:119.59 AT THAT TIME I NOTICED THAT CORRUPTION THAT GRAND CORRUPTION THAT SYSTEMATIC CORRUPTION WAS UNDERMINING EVERYTHING WE WERE TRYING TO DO
PeterEigen_2009X@120.45:132.19 AND THEREFORE I BEGAN TO NOT ONLY TRY TO PROTECT THE WORK OF THE WORLD BANK OUR OWN PROJECTS OUR OWN PROGRAMS AGAINST CORRUPTION BUT IN GENERAL I THOUGHT
PeterEigen_2009X@132.60:140.69 WE NEED A SYSTEM TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD FROM THE RAVAGES OF CORRUPTION
PeterEigen_2009X@141.63:150.88 AND AS SOON AS I STARTED THIS WORK I RECEIVED A MEMORANDUM FROM THE WORLD BANK FROM THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT FIRST IN WHICH THEY SAID YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THIS
PeterEigen_2009X@161.64:172.21 IN THE MEAN TIME I WAS CHAIRING DONOR MEETINGS FOR INSTANCE IN WHICH THE VARIOUS DONORS AND MANY OF THEM LIKE TO BE IN NAIROBI IT IS TRUE IT IS ONE OF THE
PeterEigen_2009X@173.29:184.89 CITIES OF THE WORLD BUT THEY LIKE TO BE THERE BECAUSE THE OTHER CITIES ARE EVEN LESS COMFORTABLE AND IN THESE DONOR MEETINGS I NOTICED THAT MANY OF THE WORST PROJECTS WHICH WERE PUT FORWARD
PeterEigen_2009X@185.24:193.56 BY OUR CLIENTS BY THE GOVERNMENTS BY PROMOTERS MANY OF THEM REPRESENTING SUPPLIERS FROM THE NORTH
PeterEigen_2009X@193.88:202.78 THAT THE WORST PROJECTS WERE REALIZED FIRST LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE A HUGE POWER PROJECT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
PeterEigen_2009X@204.77:213.28 TO BE BUILT SMACK INTO ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE AND ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AREAS OF WESTERN KENYA AND WE ALL
PeterEigen_2009X@213.87:227.13 NOTICED IMMEDIATELY THAT THIS PROJECT HAD NO ECONOMIC BENEFITS IT HAD NO CLIENTS NOBODY WOULD BUY THE ELECTRICITY THERE NOBODY WAS INTERESTED IN IRRIGATION PROJECTS TO THE CONTRARY WE KNEW THAT THIS PROJECT WOULD DESTROY
PeterEigen_2009X@227.79:236.88 WOULD DESTROY RIPARIAN FORESTS WHICH WERE THE BASIS FOR THE SURVIVAL OF NOMADIC GROUPS THE SAMBURU AND THE
PeterEigen_2009X@238.61:252.28 SO EVERYBODY KNEW THIS IS A NOT A USELESS PROJECT THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE DAMAGING A TERRIBLE PROJECT NOT TO SPEAK ABOUT THE FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS OF THE COUNTRY FOR THESE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THE SIPHONING OFF
PeterEigen_2009X@253.02:261.45 THE SCARCE RESOURCES OF THE ECONOMY FROM MUCH MORE IMPORTANT ACTIVITIES LIKE SCHOOLS LIKE HOSPITALS AND SO ON AND YET
PeterEigen_2009X@270.78:278.57 THE GOOD PROJECTS WHICH WE AS A DONOR COMMUNITY WOULD TAKE UNDER OUR WINGS THEY TOOK YEARS YOU KNOW YOU HAD TOO MANY STUDIES AND
PeterEigen_2009X@279.19:291.39 VERY OFTEN THEY DIDN'T SUCCEED BUT THESE BAD PROJECTS WHICH WERE ABSOLUTELY DAMAGING FOR THE ECONOMY FOR MANY GENERATIONS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WHO HAD TO BE RESETTLED
PeterEigen_2009X@292.30:299.35 SUDDENLY PUT TOGETHER BY CONSORTIA OF BANKS OF SUPPLIER AGENCIES OF
PeterEigen_2009X@308.15:315.26 BETWEEN THE POWERFUL ELITES IN THE COUNTRIES THERE AND THE SUPPLIERS FROM THE NORTH
PeterEigen_2009X@315.87:326.28 NOW THESE SUPPLIERS WERE OUR BIG COMPANIES THEY WERE THE ACTORS OF THIS GLOBAL MARKET WHICH I MENTIONED IN THE BEGINNING THEY WERE THE SIEMENSES OF THIS
PeterEigen_2009X@327.17:339.31 COMING FROM FRANCE FROM THE UK FROM JAPAN FROM CANADA FROM GERMANY AND THEY WERE SYSTEMATICALLY DRIVEN BY SYSTEMATIC LARGE SCALE CORRUPTION WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT
PeterEigen_2009X@339.93:350.39 FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS HERE OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THERE OR ONE MILLION DOLLARS THERE NO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TEN MILLION TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ON THE SWISS BANK ACCOUNTS ON THE BANK ACCOUNTS OF
PeterEigen_2009X@352.83:362.08 THE PRESIDENT 'S MINISTERS THE HIGH OFFICIALS IN THE PARA STATAL SECTORS THIS WAS THE REALITY WHICH I SAW AND NOT ONLY ONE PROJECT LIKE THAT
PeterEigen_2009X@362.48:367.95 I SAW I WOULD SAY OVER THE YEARS I WORKED IN AFRICA I SAW HUNDREDS OF PROJECTS
PeterEigen_2009X@368.78:377.67 AND SO I BECAME CONVINCED THAT THIS SYSTEMATIC CORRUPTION WHICH IS PERVERTING ECONOMIC POLICY MAKING IN THESE COUNTRIES
PeterEigen_2009X@377.98:387.92 WHICH IS THE MAIN REASON FOR THE MISERY FOR THE POVERTY FOR THE CONFLICTS FOR THE VIOLENCE FOR THE DESPERATION IN MANY OF THESE
PeterEigen_2009X@390.08:400.97 THAT WE HAVE TODAY MORE THAN A BILLION PEOPLE BELOW THE ABSOLUTE POVERTY LINE THAT WE HAVE MORE THAN A BILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT PROPER DRINKING WATER IN THE WORLD TWICE THAT NUMBER
PeterEigen_2009X@402.16:408.02 MORE THAN TWO BILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT SANITATION AND SO ON AND THE CONSEQUENT ILLNESSES
PeterEigen_2009X@408.58:416.12 MOTHERS AND CHILDREN STILL CHILD MORTALITY OF MORE THAN TEN MILLION PEOPLE EVERY YEAR CHILDREN DYING
PeterEigen_2009X@416.65:427.63 FIVE YEARS OLD THE CAUSE OF THIS IS TO A LARGE EXTENT GRAND CORRUPTION NOW WHY DID THE WORLD BANK NOT LET ME DO THIS WORK
PeterEigen_2009X@441.98:450.84 GERMANY FOREIGN BRIBERY WAS ALLOWED IT WAS EVEN TAX DEDUCTIBLE NO WONDER THAT MOST OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATORS
PeterEigen_2009X@451.10:457.73 IN GERMANY BUT ALSO IN FRANCE AND UK AND SCANDINAVIA EVERYWHERE SYSTEMATICALLY BRIBED NOT ALL OF THEM BUT MOST OF
PeterEigen_2009X@459.00:470.43 AND THIS IS THE PHENOMENON WHICH I CALL FAILING GOVERNANCE BECAUSE WHEN I THEN CAME TO GERMANY AND STARTED THIS LITTLE NGO HERE IN BERLIN AT THE
PeterEigen_2009X@473.55:480.62 TOLD YOU CANNOT STOP OUR GERMAN EXPORTERS FROM BRIBING BECAUSE WE WILL LOSE OUR CONTRACTS
PeterEigen_2009X@480.95:490.03 WE WILL LOSE TO THE FRENCH WE WILL LOSE TO THE SWEDES WE'LL LOSE TO THE JAPANESE AND THEREFORE THERE WAS A INDEED A PRISONER 'S DILEMMA WHICH MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT
PeterEigen_2009X@490.69:499.64 FOR AN INDIVIDUAL COMPANY AN INDIVIDUAL EXPORTING COUNTRY TO SAY WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE THIS DEADLY
PeterEigen_2009X@501.33:503.62 OF LARGE COMPANIES TO BRIBE
PeterEigen_2009X@504.43:518.21 SO THIS IS WHAT I MEAN WITH A FAILING GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE BECAUSE EVEN THE POWERFUL GOVERNMENT WHICH WE HAVE IN GERMANY COMPARATIVELY WAS NOT ABLE TO SAY WE WILL NOT ALLOW OUR COMPANIES TO BRIBE
PeterEigen_2009X@521.59:529.99 AND THE LARGE COMPANIES THEMSELVES HAVE THIS DILEMMA MANY OF THEM DIDN'T WANT TO BRIBE MANY OF THE GERMAN COMPANIES FOR INSTANCE BELIEVE
PeterEigen_2009X@530.30:541.53 THAT THEY ARE REALLY PRODUCING A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT AT A GOOD PRICE SO THEY ARE VERY COMPETITIVE THEY ARE NOT AS GOOD AT BRIBING AS MANY OF THEIR INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS
PeterEigen_2009X@542.15:550.03 BUT THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO SHOW THEIR STRENGTHS BECAUSE THE WORLD WAS EATEN UP BY GRAND CORRUPTION
PeterEigen_2009X@551.13:558.79 AND THIS IS WHY I'M TELLING YOU THIS CIVIL SOCIETY ROSE TO THE OCCASION
PeterEigen_2009X@559.05:567.63 WE HAD A SMALL NGO TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL THEY BEGAN TO THINK OF AN ESCAPE ROUTE FROM THIS PRISONER 'S DILEMMA
PeterEigen_2009X@568.20:574.79 AND WE DEVELOPED CONCEPTS OF COLLECTIVE ACTION BASICALLY TRYING TO BRING
PeterEigen_2009X@575.10:582.67 VARIOUS COMPETITORS TOGETHER AROUND THE TABLE EXPLAINING TO ALL OF THEM HOW MUCH IT WOULD BE IN THEIR INTERESTS IF THEY SIMULTANEOUSLY WOULD STOP
PeterEigen_2009X@596.92:605.01 CONVENTION UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE OECD WHICH OBLIGED EVERYBODY TO CHANGE THEIR LAWS AND CRIMINALIZE FOREIGN BRIBERY
PeterEigen_2009X@610.53:617.12 I MEAN IT'S INTERESTING IN DOING THIS WE HAD TO SIT TOGETHER WITH THE COMPANIES WE HAD HERE IN BERLIN
PeterEigen_2009X@617.74:625.38 ASPEN INSTITUTE ON THE WANNSEE WE HAD SESSIONS WITH ABOUT TWENTY CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY AND WE DISCUSSED WITH THEM
PeterEigen_2009X@625.68:638.79 WHAT TO DO ABOUT INTERNATIONAL BRIBERY IN THE FIRST SESSION WE HAD THREE SESSIONS OVER THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS AND PRESIDENT VON WEIZSACKER BY THE WAY CHAIRED ONE OF THE SESSIONS THE FIRST ONE TO TAKE THE FEAR AWAY
PeterEigen_2009X@639.29:652.39 FROM THE ENTREPRENEURS WHO WERE NOT USED TO DEAL WITH NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND IN THE FIRST SESSION THEY ALL SAID THIS IS NOT BRIBERY WHAT WE ARE DOING THIS IS CUSTOMARY THERE THIS IS WHAT
PeterEigen_2009X@653.30:664.81 THESE OTHER CULTURES DEMAND THEY EVEN APPLAUD IT IN FACT STILL SAYS THIS TODAY AND SO THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CONVINCED THAT WHO HAVE TO STOP BRIBING
PeterEigen_2009X@666.00:673.47 BUT IN THE SECOND SESSION THEY ADMITTED ALREADY THAT THEY WOULD NEVER DO THIS WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN THESE OTHER COUNTRIES HERE IN GERMANY
PeterEigen_2009X@673.82:682.72 OR IN THE UK AND SO ON CABINET MINISTERS WOULD ADMIT THIS AND IN THE FINAL SESSION AT THE ASPEN INSTITUTE WE HAD THEM ALL SIGN AN OPEN LETTER
PeterEigen_2009X@683.97:691.77 THE KOHL GOVERNMENT AT THE TIME REQUESTING THAT THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE OECD CONVENTION AND THIS IS IN MY OPINION
PeterEigen_2009X@692.29:703.90 AN EXAMPLE OF SOFT POWER BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO CONVINCE THEM THAT THEY HAD TO GO WITH US WE HAD A LONGER TERM TIME PERSPECTIVE WE HAD A BROADER GEOGRAPHICALLY MUCH WIDER
PeterEigen_2009X@726.01:735.08 LONDON FOR INSTANCE WHERE THE BAE GOT AWAY WITH A HUGE CORRUPTION CASE WHICH THE SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE TRIED TO PROSECUTE
PeterEigen_2009X@736.28:747.64 HUNDRED MILLION BRITISH POUNDS EVERY YEAR FOR TEN YEARS TO ONE PARTICULAR OFFICIAL OF ONE PARTICULAR FRIENDLY COUNTRY WHO THEN BOUGHT FOR FORTY FOUR BILLION POUNDS OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT
PeterEigen_2009X@748.26:756.42 THIS CASE THEY ARE NOT PROSECUTING IN THE UK WHY BECAUSE THEY CONSIDER THIS AS CONTRARY TO THE SECURITY INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE
PeterEigen_2009X@757.23:769.63 CIVIL SOCIETY IS PUSHING CIVIL SOCIETY IS TRYING TO GET A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM AND ALSO IN THE UK AND ALSO IN JAPAN WHICH IS NOT PROPERLY ENFORCING AND SO ON IN GERMANY WE ARE PUSHING
PeterEigen_2009X@769.89:777.85 THE RATIFICATION OF THE UN CONVENTION WHICH IS A SUBSEQUENT CONVENTION WE ARE GERMANY IS NOT RATIFYING WHY BECAUSE
PeterEigen_2009X@778.41:786.10 IT WOULD MAKE IT NECESSARY TO CRIMINALIZE THE CORRUPTION OF DEPUTIES IN GERMANY WE HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE
PeterEigen_2009X@786.35:793.28 YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BRIBE A CIVIL SERVANT BUT YOU ARE ALLOWED TO BRIBE A DEPUTY THIS IS
PeterEigen_2009X@795.34:803.83 AND THE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THIS AND THIS IS WHY THEY CAN'T SIGN THE UN CONVENTION AGAINST FOREIGN BRIBERY ONE OF THEY VERY VERY FEW COUNTRIES
PeterEigen_2009X@804.22:814.47 WHICH IS PREACHING HONESTY AND GOOD GOVERNANCE EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD BUT NOT ABLE TO RATIFY THEY CONVENTION WHICH WE MANAGED TO GET ON THE BOOKS WITH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY COUNTRIES
PeterEigen_2009X@816.16:823.87 I SEE MY TIME IS TICKING LET ME JUST TRY TO DRAW SOME CONCLUSIONS FROM WHAT HAS HAPPENED I BELIEVE
PeterEigen_2009X@824.76:835.34 WHAT WE MANAGED TO ACHIEVE IN FIGHTING CORRUPTION ONE CAN ALSO ACHIEVE IN OTHER AREAS OF FAILING GOVERNANCE BY NOW THE UNITED NATIONS
PeterEigen_2009X@836.22:845.48 ON OUR SIDE THE WORLD BANK HAS TURNED FROM SAULUS TO PAULUS UNDER WOLFENSOHN AND THEY BECAME I WOULD SAY THE STRONGEST ANTI CORRUPTION AGENCY IN THE
PeterEigen_2009X@846.99:860.18 MOST OF THE LARGE COMPANIES ARE NOW TOTALLY CONVINCED THAT THEY HAVE TO PUT IN PLACE VERY STRONG POLICIES AGAINST BRIBERY AND SO ON AND THIS IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE CIVIL SOCIETY JOINED
PeterEigen_2009X@860.86:871.37 THE COMPANIES AND JOINED THE GOVERNMENT IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEM IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF REMEDIES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REFORMS AND THEN LATER IN THE
PeterEigen_2009X@873.42:885.36 OF COURSE IF CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS WANT TO PLAY THAT ROLE THEY HAVE TO GROW INTO THIS RESPONSIBILITY NOT ALL CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS ARE GOOD
PeterEigen_2009X@886.15:896.16 THE KU KLUX KLAN IS AN NGO SO WE MUST BE AWARE THAT CIVIL SOCIETY HAS TO SHAPE UP ITSELF THEY HAVE TO HAVE A MUCH MORE
PeterEigen_2009X@896.87:903.97 TRANSPARENT FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE THEY HAVE TO HAVE A MUCH MORE PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE IN MANY CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS
PeterEigen_2009X@904.37:913.77 WE ALSO NEED MUCH MORE COMPETENCE OF CIVIL SOCIETY LEADERS THIS IS WHY WE HAVE SET UP THE GOVERNANCE SCHOOL AND THE CENTER FOR CIVIL SOCIETY HERE IN BERLIN BECAUSE WE BELIEVE
PeterEigen_2009X@914.63:924.80 MOST OF OUR EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS IN GERMANY AND CONTINENTAL EUROPE IN GENERAL DO NOT FOCUS ENOUGH YET EMPOWERING CIVIL SOCIETY AND TRAINING THE LEADERSHIP
PeterEigen_2009X@926.16:938.71 BUT WHAT I'M SAYING FROM MY VERY PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IF CIVIL SOCIETY DOES IT RIGHT AND JOINS THE OTHER ACTORS IN PARTICULAR GOVERNMENTS GOVERNMENTS AND
PeterEigen_2009X@961.18:961.62 THANK YOU
