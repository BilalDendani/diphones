StefanSagmeister_2004 ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO
StefanSagmeister_2004 WENT TO VISIT A FRIEND IN HONG KONG
StefanSagmeister_2004 AT THE TIME I WAS VERY SUPERSTITIOUS
StefanSagmeister_2004 SO UPON LANDING THIS WAS STILL AT THE OLD HONG KONG AIRPORT THAT'S KAI TAK
StefanSagmeister_2004 WAS SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY I THOUGHT
StefanSagmeister_2004 IF I SEE SOMETHING GOOD I'M GOING TO HAVE A GREAT TIME HERE IN MY TWO WEEKS
StefanSagmeister_2004 AND IF I SEE SOMETHING NEGATIVE
StefanSagmeister_2004 I'M GOING TO BE MISERABLE INDEED
StefanSagmeister_2004 GOT TO A FULL STOP
StefanSagmeister_2004 IN FRONT OF THIS LITTLE BILLBOARD
StefanSagmeister_2004 TO SEE SOME OF THE DESIGN COMPANIES IN HONG KONG IN MY STAY THERE
StefanSagmeister_2004 AND IT TURNED OUT THAT
StefanSagmeister_2004 I JUST WENT TO SEE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN HONG KONG
StefanSagmeister_2004 I FLEW BACK TO AUSTRIA PACKED MY BAGS
StefanSagmeister_2004 AND ANOTHER WEEK LATER I WAS AGAIN ON MY WAY TO HONG KONG
StefanSagmeister_2004 STILL SUPERSTITIONS
StefanSagmeister_2004 AND THINKING WELL IF THAT WINNER BILLBOARD IS STILL UP
StefanSagmeister_2004 I'M GOING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME WORKING HERE BUT IF IT'S GONE
StefanSagmeister_2004 IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY MISERABLE AND STRESSFUL
StefanSagmeister_2004 SO IT TURNED OUT THAT NOT ONLY WAS THE BILLBOARD STILL UP
StefanSagmeister_2004 BUT THEY HAD PUT THIS ONE RIGHT NEXT TO IT
StefanSagmeister_2004 ON THE OTHER HAND IT ALSO TAUGHT ME WHERE SUPERSTITION GETS ME BECAUSE I REALLY HAD A TERRIBLE TIME
StefanSagmeister_2004 HOWEVER I DID HAVE
StefanSagmeister_2004 A NUMBER OF REAL MOMENTS OF HAPPINESS IN MY LIFE
StefanSagmeister_2004 YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT THE CONFERENCE BROCHURE
StefanSagmeister_2004 REFERS TO AS MOMENTS THAT
StefanSagmeister_2004 TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY
StefanSagmeister_2004 SINCE I'M A BIG LIST MAKER I ACTUALLY
StefanSagmeister_2004 NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE TROUBLE OF READING THEM AND I WON 'T READ THEM FOR YOU I KNOW THAT IT'S INCREDIBLY BORING TO HEAR ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE 'S
StefanSagmeister_2004 I DID DO
StefanSagmeister_2004 IS I ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THEM
StefanSagmeister_2004 TWO DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES THERE'S ONE FROM A CONSUMER 'S POINT OF VIEW WHERE I WAS HAPPY WHILE EXPERIENCING DESIGN AND I'LL JUST GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE
StefanSagmeister_2004 MY BROTHER HAD THIS GREAT YAMAHA MOTORCYCLE THAT HE WAS WILLING TO BORROW TO ME FREELY
StefanSagmeister_2004 I REMEMBER IT AS A TRUE
StefanSagmeister_2004 MOMENT OF HAPPINESS YOU KNOW OF COURSE THEY ARE
StefanSagmeister_2004 THIS COMBINATION OF AT LEAST TWO OF THEM BEING YOU KNOW DESIGN OBJECTS
StefanSagmeister_2004 AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A SCALE OF HAPPINESS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT IN DESIGN
StefanSagmeister_2004 THE MOTORCYCLE INCIDENT WOULD DEFINITELY BE YOU KNOW SITUATED SOMEWHERE HERE RIGHT IN THERE BETWEEN DELIGHT AND BLISS
StefanSagmeister_2004 NOW THERE IS THE
StefanSagmeister_2004 FROM A DESIGNER 'S STANDPOINT IF YOU'RE HAPPY WHILE ACTUALLY DOING IT
StefanSagmeister_2004 ONE WAY TO SEE HOW HAPPY DESIGNERS ARE WHEN THEY'RE DESIGNING COULD BE TO LOOK AT THE
StefanSagmeister_2004 AUTHORS PHOTOS ON THE BACK OF THEIR MONOGRAPHS
StefanSagmeister_2004 AS WELL AS THE MEXICANS ARE VERY HAPPY
StefanSagmeister_2004 WHILE SOMEWHAT THE SPANIARDS
StefanSagmeister_2004 AND I THINK PARTICULARLY
StefanSagmeister_2004 BE DOING ALL THAT
StefanSagmeister_2004 LAST NOVEMBER A MUSEUM OPENED IN TOKYO CALLED THE MORI MUSEUM
StefanSagmeister_2004 IN A SKYSCRAPER UP ON THE FIFTY SIXTH FLOOR
StefanSagmeister_2004 AND I WENT VERY EAGERLY TO SEE IT BECAUSE WELL ALSO WITH AN EYE ON THIS CONFERENCE
StefanSagmeister_2004 THEY INTERESTINGLY
StefanSagmeister_2004 EXHIBIT OFF INTO FOUR DIFFERENT
StefanSagmeister_2004 IN DIFFERENT FORMS
StefanSagmeister_2004 THIS APPLE BY YOKO ONO THAT OF COURSE LATER ON WAS YOU KNOW
StefanSagmeister_2004 MADE INTO THE LABEL FOR THE BEATLES
StefanSagmeister_2004 UNDER NIRVANA
StefanSagmeister_2004 A LITTLE AN INTERESTING THEORY ABOUT ABSTRACTION THIS IS
StefanSagmeister_2004 ACTUALLY AN YVES KLINE PAINTING AND THE THEORY WAS THAT IF YOU ABSTRACT AN IMAGE
StefanSagmeister_2004 YOU REALLY YOU KNOW OPEN
StefanSagmeister_2004 AS MUCH ROOM FOR THE UNREPRESENTABLE AND
StefanSagmeister_2004 YOU KNOW ARE ABLE TO INVOLVE THE VIEWER MORE
StefanSagmeister_2004 SILK
StefanSagmeister_2004 AND LASTLY UNDER HARMONY THEY HAD THIS THIRTEENTH CENTURY
StefanSagmeister_2004 FROM
StefanSagmeister_2004 NOW WHAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THE EXHIBIT WAS THAT
StefanSagmeister_2004 MAYBE WITH THE EXCEPTION
StefanSagmeister_2004 MOST OF
StefanSagmeister_2004 AND I FELT A LITTLE BIT CHEATED BECAUSE THE VISUALIZATION THAT'S A REALLY EASY THING TO DO AND YOU KNOW MY STUDIO WE'VE DONE IT ALL THE TIME THIS IS YOU KNOW
StefanSagmeister_2004 A BOOK A HAPPY DOG AND YOU TAKE IT OUT IT'S AN AGGRESSIVE DOG IT'S A HAPPY DAVID BYRNE AND AN ANGRY DAVID
StefanSagmeister_2004 OR A JAZZ POSTER WITH A HAPPY FACE AND A MORE AGGRESSIVE FACE YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT A BIG DEAL
StefanSagmeister_2004 TO ACCOMPLISH
StefanSagmeister_2004 GOTTEN TO THE POINT
StefanSagmeister_2004 YOU KNOW WITHIN ADVERTISING OR WITHIN THE MOVIE INDUSTRY HAPPY HAS GOTTEN SUCH A BAD
StefanSagmeister_2004 WANT TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE SUBJECT AND STILL APPEAR AUTHENTIC
StefanSagmeister_2004 YOU ALMOST WOULD HAVE TO YOU KNOW
StefanSagmeister_2004 DO IT FROM A CYNICAL POINT OF VIEW
StefanSagmeister_2004 A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO DESIGNED A BOX SET FOR THE TALKING HEADS WHERE THE HAPPINESS
StefanSagmeister_2004 MUCH MUCH MORE DIFFICULT IS
StefanSagmeister_2004 THIS WHERE THE DESIGNS ACTUALLY CAN
StefanSagmeister_2004 EVOKE HAPPINESS AND
StefanSagmeister_2004 SHOW YOU THREE THAT ACTUALLY DID THIS FOR ME
StefanSagmeister_2004 DONE BY A YOUNG ARTIST IN NEW YORK WHO CALLS HIMSELF
StefanSagmeister_2004 EVERYBODY WHO HAS RIDDEN THE NEW YORK SUBWAY SYSTEM WILL BE FAMILIAR
StefanSagmeister_2004 PRINTED HIS OWN VERSION OF THESE SIGNS MET EVERY WEDNESDAY AT A SUBWAY STOP WITH TWENTY OF HIS FRIENDS THEY DIVIDED UP THE DIFFERENT SUBWAY LINES
StefanSagmeister_2004 NOW THE WAY THIS WORKS IN THE SYSTEM IS THAT NOBODY EVER LOOKS AT THESE SIGNS SO YOU'RE YOU'RE REALLY
StefanSagmeister_2004 IN THE SUBWAY AND YOU KIND OF STARE AT SOMETHING AND IT TAKES YOU A WHILE UNTIL IT ACTUALLY YOU REALIZE THAT THIS SAYS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT NORMALLY SAYS
StefanSagmeister_2004 MEAN THAT 'S AT LEAST HOW IT MADE ME HAPPY
StefanSagmeister_2004 AND ALSO GAVE THIS
StefanSagmeister_2004 FROM THE MTA TO EVERYBODY SORT OF LIKE PRETENDING THAT IT'S AN ART PROJECT FINANCED BY THE METROPOLITAN TRANSIT AUTHORITY
StefanSagmeister_2004 NEW YORK PROJECT THIS IS AT P S ONE
StefanSagmeister_2004 A SCULPTURE THAT'S BASICALLY A SQUARE ROOM BY JAMES TURRELL THAT HAS A RETRACTABLE
StefanSagmeister_2004 CEILING OPENS UP
StefanSagmeister_2004 DUSK AND DAWN EVERY DAY YOU DON'T SEE THE HORIZON YOU'RE JUST IN THERE WATCHING THE INCREDIBLE SUBTLE CHANGES OF COLOR IN THE SKY
StefanSagmeister_2004 THE ROOM IS
StefanSagmeister_2004 SOMETHING TO BE SEEN
StefanSagmeister_2004 DEMEANOR CHANGES WHEN THEY GO
StefanSagmeister_2004 AND FOR SURE I HAVEN'T LOOKED
StefanSagmeister_2004 THAN THOSE THREE PROJECTS THAT I'M SHOWING HERE
StefanSagmeister_2004 I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY THAT OBSERVING VIK MUNIZ CLOUD A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IN MANHATTAN
StefanSagmeister_2004 FOR SURE MADE ME HAPPY AS WELL
StefanSagmeister_2004 BUT MY LAST PROJECT IS AGAIN FROM A YOUNG DESIGNER IN NEW YORK HE 'S FROM KOREA ORIGINALLY AND HE TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO PRINT
StefanSagmeister_2004 FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND
StefanSagmeister_2004 SPEECH BUBBLES EMPTY SPEECH BUBBLES STICKERS LARGE ONES AND SMALL ONES AND HE GOES AROUND NEW YORK AND JUST PUTS THEM EMPTY AS THEY ARE ON POSTERS
StefanSagmeister_2004 PEOPLE GO AND FILL THEM IN
StefanSagmeister_2004 THIS ONE SAYS PLEASE LET ME DIE IN PEACE
StefanSagmeister_2004 I THINK THAT WAS THE MOST SURPRISING TO MYSELF WAS THAT THE WRITING WAS ACTUALLY SO GOOD THIS IS ON A MUSICIAN POSTER THAT SAYS
StefanSagmeister_2004 I AM CONCERNED THAT MY CD WILL NOT SELL MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS AND THAT AS A RESULT MY RECOUPABLE ADVANCE
StefanSagmeister_2004 FROM MY LABEL WILL BE TAKEN FROM ME AFTER WHICH MY CONTRACT WILL BE CANCELLED AND I'LL BE BACK DOING JOURNEY COVERS ON BLEECKER STREET
StefanSagmeister_2004 I THINK THE REASON THIS WORKS SO WELL IS BECAUSE EVERYBODY INVOLVED WINS JEE GETS TO HAVE HIS PROJECT THE PUBLIC GETS
StefanSagmeister_2004 SWEETER ENVIRONMENT AND DIFFERENT PUBLIC GETS A PLACE TO EXPRESS THEMSELF AND THE ADVERTISERS FINALLY GET SOMEBODY TO LOOK AT THEIR ADS
StefanSagmeister_2004 WAS A QUESTION OF COURSE THAT WAS ON MY MIND FOR A WHILE
StefanSagmeister_2004 YOU KNOW CAN I DO MORE OF THE THINGS THAT I LIKE DOING IN DESIGN AND LESS OF THE ONES
StefanSagmeister_2004 THAT I DON'T LIKE TO BE DOING
StefanSagmeister_2004 BROUGHT ME BACK TO MY LIST MAKING YOU KNOW JUST TO SEE WHAT I ACTUALLY LIKE ABOUT MY JOB YOU KNOW ONE
StefanSagmeister_2004 JUST WORKING WITHOUT PRESSURE
StefanSagmeister_2004 WITHOUT BEING FRAZZLED OR AS NANCY SAID BEFORE LIKE
StefanSagmeister_2004 THIS IS YOU KNOW RELATED TO IT GETTING OUT OF THE STUDIO
StefanSagmeister_2004 THEN OF COURSE TRYING TO YOU KNOW WORK ON THINGS WHERE THE CONTENT IS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME
StefanSagmeister_2004 BEING ABLE TO ENJOY THE END RESULTS
StefanSagmeister_2004 I FOUND ANOTHER LIST IN ONE OF MY DIARIES
StefanSagmeister_2004 JUST ABOUT AT THAT TIME AN AUSTRIAN MAGAZINE CALLED AND ASKED
StefanSagmeister_2004 THE WHOLE THING JUST FELL TOGETHER SO I JUST
StefanSagmeister_2004 ONE OF THE THINGS
StefanSagmeister_2004 FRENCH COMPANY ASKED US TO DESIGN FIVE BILLBOARDS FOR THEM AGAIN WE COULD SUPPLY THE CONTENT FOR IT
StefanSagmeister_2004 ME AND MYSELF
StefanSagmeister_2004 THIS ONE SO IT 'S TRYING
StefanSagmeister_2004 DID ONE MORE OF
StefanSagmeister_2004 THIS IS AGAIN FOR A MAGAZINE DIVIDING PAGES
StefanSagmeister_2004 THIS IS HAVING THIS IS THE SAME THING
StefanSagmeister_2004 IT'S JUST YOU KNOW PHOTOGRAPHED FROM THE SIDE THIS IS FROM THE FRONT
StefanSagmeister_2004 THEN IT 'S GUTS AGAIN IT'S THE SAME THING GUTS IS JUST THE SAME ROOM
StefanSagmeister_2004 IT'S FOR WITH THE LIGHT ON
