ErinMcKean_2007@13.05:18.30 NOW HAVE ANY OF Y 'ALL EVER LOOKED UP THIS WORD YOU KNOW IN A DICTIONARY
ErinMcKean_2007@21.33:29.14 HOW ABOUT THIS WORD HERE I'LL SHOW IT TO YOU LEXICOGRAPHY THE PRACTICE OF COMPILING DICTIONARIES NOTICE WE'RE VERY SPECIFIC THAT WORD COMPILE
ErinMcKean_2007@48.97:59.19 THAT YOU GET TO SAY REALLY FUN WORDS LIKE LEXICOGRAPHICAL LEXICOGRAPHICAL HAS THIS GREAT PATTERN IT'S CALLED A DOUBLE DACTYL AND JUST BY SAYING DOUBLE DACTYL I'VE SENT THE GEEK NEEDLE ALL THE WAY INTO THE RED
ErinMcKean_2007@63.17:66.94 IS THE SAME PATTERN AS HIGGLEDY PIGGLEDY RIGHT IT'S A FUN WORD TO SAY AND I GET TO SAY
ErinMcKean_2007@68.81:80.74 ONE OF THE NON PERKS OF BEING A LEXICOGRAPHER IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T USUALLY HAVE A KIND OF WARM FUZZY SNUGGLY IMAGE OF THE DICTIONARY RIGHT NOBODY HUGS THEIR DICTIONARIES BUT
ErinMcKean_2007@81.49:88.91 WHAT PEOPLE REALLY OFTEN THINK ABOUT THE DICTIONARY IS THEY THINK MORE LIKE THIS JUST TO LET YOU KNOW I DO NOT HAVE A LEXICOGRAPHICAL WHISTLE
ErinMcKean_2007@97.82:102.65 BUT THE THING IS I DON'T WANT TO BE A TRAFFIC COP FOR ONE THING I JUST DO NOT DO UNIFORMS
ErinMcKean_2007@106.57:111.57 WORDS ARE GOOD AND WHAT WORDS ARE BAD IS ACTUALLY NOT VERY EASY AND IT'S NOT VERY FUN AND
ErinMcKean_2007@112.64:117.02 YOUR JOB ARE NOT EASY OR FUN YOU KIND OF LOOK FOR AN EXCUSE NOT TO DO
ErinMcKean_2007@118.36:118.90 SO
ErinMcKean_2007@120.04:124.64 TO THINK OF SOME KIND OF OCCUPATION AS A METAPHOR FOR MY WORK I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE
ErinMcKean_2007@126.42:133.92 THROW MY BIG NET INTO THE DEEP BLUE OCEAN OF ENGLISH AND SEE WHAT MARVELOUS CREATURES I CAN DRAG UP FROM THE BOTTOM
ErinMcKean_2007@138.82:140.09 FISHING WELL
ErinMcKean_2007@149.27:157.71 REALLY NOT CHANGED OUR IDEA OF WHAT A DICTIONARY IS HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE HER REIGN THE ONLY THING QUEEN VICTORIA WOULD NOT BE AMUSED BY
ErinMcKean_2007@173.35:178.98 SO HE 'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF WHAT WE CONSIDER MODERN IN DICTIONARIES TODAY WHEN A GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE
ErinMcKean_2007@187.43:191.78 A JOB ON ANY DICTIONARY TODAY THERE'D BE VIRTUALLY NO LEARNING
ErinMcKean_2007@204.35:209.22 BUT COMPUTERS DON'T DO MUCH ELSE OTHER THAN SPEED UP THE
ErinMcKean_2007@210.50:214.39 COMPILING DICTIONARIES THEY DON'T CHANGE THE END
ErinMcKean_2007@216.61:223.58 WHAT A DICTIONARY IS IS IT'S VICTORIAN DESIGN MERGED WITH A LITTLE BIT OF MODERN PROPULSION IT'S STEAMPUNK WHAT WE HAVE
ErinMcKean_2007@223.93:225.42 IS AN ELECTRIC VELOCIPEDE
ErinMcKean_2007@225.92:236.44 YOU KNOW WE HAVE VICTORIAN DESIGN WITH AN ENGINE ON IT THAT'S ALL THE DESIGN HAS NOT CHANGED AND OK WHAT ABOUT ONLINE DICTIONARIES RIGHT ONLINE DICTIONARIES MUST BE DIFFERENT
ErinMcKean_2007@291.90:302.93 WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A HAM BUTT PROBLEM DOES EVERYONE KNOW THE HAM BUTT PROBLEM WOMAN 'S MAKING A HAM FOR A BIG FAMILY DINNER SHE GOES TO CUT THE BUTT OFF THE HAM AND THROW IT AWAY AND SHE LOOKS AT THIS PIECE
ErinMcKean_2007@325.96:333.48 THAT HAM BUTT IS DELICIOUS THERE'S NO REASON TO THROW IT AWAY THE BAD WORDS SEE WHEN PEOPLE THINK ABOUT A PLACE AND THEY DON'T FIND A PLACE ON THE MAP
ErinMcKean_2007@346.63:351.44 IT'S MORE LIKELY TO BE A BAD DICTIONARY WHY ARE YOU BLAMING THE HAM FOR BEING TOO BIG
ErinMcKean_2007@354.64:367.69 SO YOU CAN'T GET A SMALLER HAM THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS AS BIG AS IT IS SO IF YOU HAVE A HAM BUTT PROBLEM AND YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE HAM BUTT PROBLEM THE CONCLUSION IT LEADS YOU TO IS INEXORABLE AND COUNTER INTUITIVE
ErinMcKean_2007@368.43:376.40 PAPER IS THE ENEMY OF WORDS HOW CAN THIS BE I MEAN I LOVE BOOKS I REALLY LOVE BOOKS SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS ARE BOOKS
ErinMcKean_2007@406.77:410.70 NOT GOING TO BE THE PROTOTYPE FOR THE SHAPES DICTIONARIES COME IN SO
ErinMcKean_2007@411.17:421.66 THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY IF YOU'VE GOT AN ARTIFICIAL CONSTRAINT ARTIFICIAL CONSTRAINTS LEAD TO ARBITRARY DISTINCTIONS AND A SKEWED WORLDVIEW
ErinMcKean_2007@422.10:432.44 WHAT IF BIOLOGISTS COULD ONLY STUDY ANIMALS THAT MADE PEOPLE GO AWW RIGHT WHAT IF WE MADE AESTHETIC JUDGMENTS ABOUT ANIMALS AND ONLY THE ONES WE THOUGHT WERE CUTE WERE THE ONES THAT WE COULD STUDY
ErinMcKean_2007@441.24:448.35 I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM I THINK WE SHOULD STUDY ALL THE WORDS BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WORDS YOU CAN MAKE
ErinMcKean_2007@450.52:458.97 FROM VERY HUMBLE PARTS LEXICOGRAPHY IS REALLY MORE ABOUT MATERIAL SCIENCE WE ARE STUDYING THE TOLERANCES
ErinMcKean_2007@477.05:477.33 THINK
ErinMcKean_2007@478.27:482.99 IF WE THINK WORDS ARE THE TOOLS THAT WE USE TO BUILD THE EXPRESSIONS OF OUR
ErinMcKean_2007@484.18:487.13 HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT SCREWDRIVERS ARE BETTER THAN HAMMERS
ErinMcKean_2007@487.65:490.86 HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT A SLEDGEHAMMER IS BETTER THAN A BALL PEEN HAMMER
ErinMcKean_2007@491.87:496.31 JUST THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB AND SO PEOPLE SAY TO ME HOW DO I KNOW IF A WORD IS
ErinMcKean_2007@506.70:520.93 THAT MAKES IT REAL BEING IN THE DICTIONARY IS AN ARTIFICIAL DISTINCTION IT DOESN'T MAKE A WORD ANY MORE REAL THAN ANY OTHER WAY IF YOU LOVE A WORD IT BECOMES REAL SO IF WE'RE NOT WORRYING ABOUT DIRECTING
ErinMcKean_2007@522.04:525.03 IF WE'VE TRANSCENDED PAPER IF WE
ErinMcKean_2007@526.35:534.10 WORRYING LESS ABOUT CONTROL AND MORE ABOUT DESCRIPTION THEN WE CAN THINK OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AS BEING THIS BEAUTIFUL
ErinMcKean_2007@535.36:544.03 AND ANY TIME ONE OF THOSE LITTLE PARTS OF THE MOBILE CHANGES IS TOUCHED ANY TIME YOU TOUCH A WORD YOU USE IT IN A NEW CONTEXT YOU GIVE IT A NEW CONNOTATION YOU VERB IT
ErinMcKean_2007@545.07:547.03 YOU MAKE THE MOBILE MOVE
ErinMcKean_2007@548.99:551.01 JUST IN A NEW POSITION AND THAT NEW POSITION
ErinMcKean_2007@567.71:572.07 MAYBE TO COUNT THE CARS THAT GO BY THEN MORE EYEBALLS ARE BETTER
ErinMcKean_2007@589.11:597.90 THAT WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO MORE THAN TWO UNABRIDGED DICTIONARIES AND I FIND AN UN DICTIONARIED WORD A WORD LIKE UN DICTIONARIED FOR EXAMPLE IN
ErinMcKean_2007@599.59:600.91 EVERY BOOK I READ
ErinMcKean_2007@623.61:630.68 A LOT AND I'M NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT MAGAZINES I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT BLOGS AND I FIND MORE NEW WORDS ON BOINGBOING IN A GIVEN WEEK THAN I DO NEWSWEEK OR TIME
ErinMcKean_2007@642.91:644.01 IF YOU THINK OF THE WORD
ErinMcKean_2007@645.40:646.18 A BADGER 'S BURROW
ErinMcKean_2007@647.05:657.49 CAN BE ONE OF THE PLEATS IN AN ELIZABETHAN RUFF AND THERE'S ONE NUMBERED DEFINITION IN THE OED THE OED HAS THIRTY THREE DIFFERENT NUMBERED DEFINITIONS FOR SET TINY LITTLE WORD THIRTY THREE NUMBERED DEFINITIONS
ErinMcKean_2007@675.43:685.89 AND WE REALLY NEED HELP AND THE THING IS WE COULD ASK FOR HELP ASKING FOR HELP 'S NOT THAT HARD I MEAN LEXICOGRAPHY IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE SEE I JUST GAVE YOU A LOT OF WORDS AND A LOT OF NUMBERS
ErinMcKean_2007@699.74:708.79 WE DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE SHAPE OF THE LANGUAGE IF THIS WAS THE DICTIONARY IF THIS WAS THE MAP OF AMERICAN ENGLISH LOOK WE HAVE
ErinMcKean_2007@709.34:711.04 KIND OF LUMPY IDEA OF FLORIDA
ErinMcKean_2007@720.84:727.58 WE DON'T EVEN SEE THAT THERE'S A GAP ON THE MAP SO AGAIN LEXICOGRAPHY IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE BUT EVEN IF IT WERE
ErinMcKean_2007@732.96:734.43 YOU KNOW IT CAN'T BE THAT
ErinMcKean_2007@738.57:749.21 OTHER DISCIPLINES ARE REALLY ASKING PEOPLE TO HELP AND THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB OF IT FOR INSTANCE THERE'S EBIRD WHERE AMATEUR BIRDWATCHERS CAN UPLOAD INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR BIRD SIGHTINGS AND THEN ORNITHOLOGISTS CAN GO
ErinMcKean_2007@763.26:769.29 SO MANY COMETS THEY NAMED A COMET AFTER HIM IT'S KIND OF OUT PAST MARS IT'S A HIKE I DON'T THINK HE 'S GETTING HIS PICTURE TAKEN THERE ANYTIME SOON
ErinMcKean_2007@781.66:788.34 BE ABLE TO FIND WORDS NOW Y 'ALL KNOW WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS BECAUSE I'M GOING TO THE INTERNET WHICH IS WHERE EVERYBODY GOES
ErinMcKean_2007@802.29:806.10 HAPPEN TO BE THE RECIPE FOR LEXICOGRAPHY ISN'T THAT GREAT SO
ErinMcKean_2007@819.80:826.95 IS LIKE AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL ARTIFACT IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE PROVENANCE OR THE SOURCE OF THE ARTIFACT IT'S NOT SCIENCE
ErinMcKean_2007@827.45:836.97 IT'S A PRETTY THING TO LOOK AT SO A WORD WITHOUT ITS SOURCE IS LIKE A CUT FLOWER YOU KNOW IT'S PRETTY TO LOOK AT FOR A WHILE BUT THEN IT DIES IT DIES TOO FAST SO
ErinMcKean_2007@845.39:849.99 WELL PEOPLE USE THE DICTIONARY TO STAND FOR THE WHOLE LANGUAGE THEY USE IT SYNECDOCHICALLY
ErinMcKean_2007@851.28:862.72 ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF KNOWING A WORD LIKE SYNECDOCHICALLY IS THAT YOU REALLY WANT AN EXCUSE TO SAY SYNECDOCHICALLY THIS WHOLE TALK HAS JUST BEEN AN EXCUSE TO GET ME TO THE POINT WHERE I COULD SAY SYNECDOCHICALLY TO ALL OF YOU SO I'M REALLY SORRY
ErinMcKean_2007@863.18:872.84 BUT WHEN YOU USE A PART OF SOMETHING LIKE THE DICTIONARY IS A PART OF THE LANGUAGE OR A FLAG STANDS FOR THE UNITED STATES A SYMBOL OF THE COUNTRY THEN YOU'RE USING IT SYNECDOCHICALLY
ErinMcKean_2007@875.46:881.10 WE COULD MAKE THE DICTIONARY THE WHOLE LANGUAGE IF WE GET A BIGGER PAN
ErinMcKean_2007@881.84:885.67 THEN WE CAN PUT ALL THE WORDS IN WE CAN PUT IN
ErinMcKean_2007@886.42:888.66 ALL THE MEANINGS DOESN'T EVERYONE WANT MORE MEANING
ErinMcKean_2007@891.70:902.34 WE CAN MAKE THE DICTIONARY NOT JUST BE A SYMBOL OF THE LANGUAGE WE CAN MAKE IT BE THE WHOLE LANGUAGE YOU SEE WHAT I'M REALLY HOPING FOR IS THAT MY SON WHO TURNS SEVEN THIS MONTH I
ErinMcKean_2007@914.98:917.66 DIED BECAUSE IT WASN'T USEFUL ENOUGH IT
ErinMcKean_2007@918.70:933.58 REALLY WHAT PEOPLE NEEDED AND THE THING IS IF WE CAN PUT IN ALL THE WORDS NO LONGER HAVE THAT ARTIFICIAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD WE CAN REALLY DESCRIBE THE LANGUAGE LIKE SCIENTISTS WE CAN LEAVE THE AESTHETIC JUDGMENTS TO THE WRITERS AND THE SPEAKERS IF WE CAN DO THAT
ErinMcKean_2007@935.73:941.61 TIME FISHING AND I DON'T HAVE TO BE A TRAFFIC COP ANYMORE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR KIND
