PaulWolpe_2010X DESIGN BUT NOT DESIGN AS WE USUALLY THINK ABOUT IT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW IN OUR SCIENTIFIC BIOTECHNOLOGICAL CULTURE WHERE FOR REALLY THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY WE HAVE THE POWER TO DESIGN BODIES TO DESIGN ANIMAL BODIES TO DESIGN HUMAN
PaulWolpe_2010X BODIES
PaulWolpe_2010X IN THE HISTORY OF OUR PLANET THERE HAVE BEEN THREE GREAT WAVES OF EVOLUTION
PaulWolpe_2010X THE FIRST WAVE OF EVOLUTION IS WHAT WE THINK OF AS DARWINIAN EVOLUTION SO AS YOU ALL KNOW SPECIES LIVED IN PARTICULAR ECOLOGICAL NICHES AND PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENTS AND THE PRESSURES OF THOSE ENVIRONMENTS SELECTED WHICH CHANGES THROUGH RANDOM MUTATION IN SPECIES WERE GOING TO BE PRESERVED
PaulWolpe_2010X THEN HUMAN BEINGS STEPPED OUT OF THE DARWINIAN FLOW OF EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY AND CREATED THE SECOND GREAT WAVE OF EVOLUTION WHICH WAS WE CHANGED THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE EVOLVED
PaulWolpe_2010X FLOW OF OUR EVOLUTION
PaulWolpe_2010X BY CHANGING OUR ENVIRONMENT WE PUT NEW PRESSURES ON OUR BODIES TO EVOLVE WHETHER IT WAS THROUGH SETTLING DOWN IN AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES ALL THE WAY THROUGH MODERN MEDICINE WE HAVE CHANGED OUR OWN EVOLUTION
PaulWolpe_2010X NOW WE 'RE ENTERING A THIRD GREAT WAVE OF
PaulWolpe_2010X EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY WHICH HAS BEEN CALLED MANY THINGS INTENTIONAL EVOLUTION EVOLUTION
PaulWolpe_2010X BY DESIGN VERY DIFFERENT THAN INTELLIGENT DESIGN WHEREBY WE ARE ACTUALLY NOW
PaulWolpe_2010X INTENTIONALLY DESIGNING AND ALTERING THE PHYSIOLOGICAL
PaulWolpe_2010X FORMS THAT INHABIT OUR PLANET SO I WANT TO TAKE YOU THROUGH A KIND OF WHIRLWIND TOUR OF THAT AND THEN AT THE END TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS ARE FOR US AND FOR OUR SPECIES AS WELL AS OUR CULTURES BECAUSE OF THIS CHANGE NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR A LONG TIME
PaulWolpe_2010X WE STARTED SELECTIVELY BREEDING ANIMALS MANY MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO
PaulWolpe_2010X AND IF YOU THINK OF DOGS FOR EXAMPLE DOGS ARE NOW INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED CREATURES THERE ISN 'T A DOG ON THIS EARTH THAT 'S A NATURAL CREATURE DOGS ARE THE RESULT OF SELECTIVELY BREEDING TRAITS THAT WE LIKE
PaulWolpe_2010X BUT WE HAD TO DO IT THE HARD WAY IN THE OLD DAYS BY CHOOSING OFFSPRING THAT LOOKED A PARTICULAR WAY AND THEN BREEDING THEM WE DON 'T HAVE TO DO IT THAT WAY ANYMORE THIS IS A BEEFALO
PaulWolpe_2010X A BEEFALO IS A BUFFALO CATTLE HYBRID AND THEY ARE NOW MAKING THEM AND SOMEDAY PERHAPS PRETTY SOON YOU WILL HAVE BEEFALO PATTIES IN YOUR LOCAL SUPERMARKET
PaulWolpe_2010X THIS IS A GEEP A GOAT SHEEP HYBRID THE SCIENTISTS THAT MADE THIS CUTE LITTLE CREATURE ENDED UP SLAUGHTERING IT AND EATING IT AFTERWARDS I THINK THEY SAID IT TASTED LIKE CHICKEN
PaulWolpe_2010X THIS IS A CAMA
PaulWolpe_2010X OF A LLAMA AND THEY ARE NOW USING THESE IN CERTAIN CULTURES THEN THERE 'S THE LIGER
PaulWolpe_2010X THIS IS THE LARGEST CAT IN THE WORLD THE LION TIGER HYBRID IT 'S BIGGER THAN A TIGER
PaulWolpe_2010X AND IN THE CASE OF THE LIGER THERE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN ONE OR TWO THAT HAVE BEEN SEEN IN THE WILD
PaulWolpe_2010X NONE OF THIS IS PHOTOSHOPPED THESE ARE REAL CREATURES AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE 'VE BEEN DOING IS USING GENETIC ENHANCEMENT OR GENETIC MANIPULATION OF NORMAL SELECTIVE BREEDING PUSHED A LITTLE BIT THROUGH GENETICS
PaulWolpe_2010X AND IF THAT WERE ALL THIS WAS ABOUT THEN IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING THING BUT SOMETHING MUCH MUCH MORE POWERFUL IS HAPPENING NOW
PaulWolpe_2010X THESE ARE NORMAL MAMMALIAN CELLS GENETICALLY ENGINEERED WITH A BIOLUMINESCENT GENE TAKEN OUT OF DEEP SEA JELLYFISH WE ALL KNOW THAT SOME
PaulWolpe_2010X DEEP SEA CREATURES GLOW WELL THEY 'VE NOW TAKEN THAT GENE THAT BIOLUMINESCENT GENE AND PUT IT INTO MAMMAL CELLS THESE ARE NORMAL CELLS AND WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS THESE CELLS
PaulWolpe_2010X GLOWING IN THE DARK UNDER CERTAIN WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT ONCE THEY COULD DO THAT WITH CELLS THEY COULD DO IT WITH ORGANISMS SO THEY DID IT WITH MOUSE PUPS
PaulWolpe_2010X AND BY THE WAY THE REASON THE KITTENS HERE ARE ORANGE AND THESE ARE GREEN IS BECAUSE THAT 'S A BIOLUMINESCENT GENE FROM CORAL WHILE THIS IS FROM JELLYFISH THEY DID IT WITH PIGS
PaulWolpe_2010X THEY DID IT WITH PUPPIES AND
PaulWolpe_2010X AND IF YOU CAN DO IT WITH MONKEYS THOUGH THE GREAT LEAP IN TRYING TO GENETICALLY MANIPULATE IS ACTUALLY BETWEEN MONKEYS AND APES IF THEY CAN DO IT IN MONKEYS THEY CAN PROBABLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT IN APES WHICH MEANS THEY CAN
PaulWolpe_2010X DO IT IN HUMAN BEINGS
PaulWolpe_2010X IN OTHER WORDS IT IS THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE THAT BEFORE TOO LONG WE WILL BE BIOTECHNOLOGICALLY CAPABLE OF CREATING HUMAN BEINGS THAT GLOW IN THE DARK
PaulWolpe_2010X BE EASIER TO FIND US AT NIGHT AND IN FACT RIGHT NOW IN MANY STATES YOU CAN GO OUT AND YOU CAN BUY BIOLUMINESCENT PETS
PaulWolpe_2010X THESE ARE ZEBRA FISH THEY 'RE NORMALLY BLACK AND SILVER THESE ARE ZEBRA FISH THAT HAVE BEEN GENETICALLY ENGINEERED TO BE YELLOW GREEN RED AND THEY ARE ACTUALLY AVAILABLE NOW IN CERTAIN STATES OTHER STATES HAVE BANNED THEM NOBODY KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH THESE KINDS OF CREATURES
PaulWolpe_2010X GENETICALLY ENGINEERED
PaulWolpe_2010X TO BAN
PaulWolpe_2010X THE SALMON ON TOP IS A GENETICALLY ENGINEERED CHINOOK SALMON USING A GENE FROM THESE SALMON AND FROM ONE OTHER FISH THAT WE EAT TO MAKE IT GROW MUCH FASTER USING A LOT LESS FEED
PaulWolpe_2010X AND RIGHT NOW THE FDA IS TRYING TO MAKE A FINAL DECISION ON WHETHER PRETTY SOON YOU COULD BE EATING THIS FISH IT 'LL BE SOLD IN THE STORES AND BEFORE YOU GET TOO WORRIED ABOUT IT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES THE MAJORITY OF FOOD YOU BUY IN THE SUPERMARKET ALREADY HAS GENETICALLY MODIFIED COMPONENTS TO IT
PaulWolpe_2010X SO EVEN AS WE WORRY ABOUT IT WE HAVE ALLOWED IT TO GO ON IN THIS COUNTRY MUCH DIFFERENT IN EUROPE WITHOUT ANY REGULATION AND EVEN WITHOUT ANY IDENTIFICATION ON
PaulWolpe_2010X ALL THE FIRST CLONED ANIMALS OF THEIR TYPE SO IN THE LOWER RIGHT HERE YOU HAVE DOLLY THE FIRST CLONED SHEEP
PaulWolpe_2010X NOW HAPPILY STUFFED IN A MUSEUM IN EDINBURGH RALPH THE RAT THE FIRST CLONED RAT
PaulWolpe_2010X CC THE CAT FOR CLONED CAT
PaulWolpe_2010X SNUPPY THE FIRST CLONED DOG SNUPPY FOR SEOUL NATIONAL UNIVERSITY PUPPY CREATED IN SOUTH KOREA BY THE VERY SAME MAN THAT SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER HAD TO END UP RESIGNING IN DISGRACE BECAUSE HE CLAIMED HE HAD CLONED A HUMAN EMBRYO WHICH HE HAD NOT
PaulWolpe_2010X HE ACTUALLY WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO CLONE A DOG WHICH IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO BECAUSE DOG GENOMES ARE VERY PLASTIC
PaulWolpe_2010X THIS IS PROMETEA THE FIRST CLONED HORSE IT 'S A HAFLINGER HORSE CLONED IN ITALY A REAL GOLD RING OF CLONING BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY HORSES THAT WIN IMPORTANT RACES WHO ARE GELDINGS
PaulWolpe_2010X IN OTHER WORDS THE EQUIPMENT TO PUT THEM OUT TO STUD HAS BEEN REMOVED BUT IF YOU CAN CLONE THAT HORSE YOU CAN HAVE BOTH THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING A GELDING RUN IN THE RACE AND HIS
PaulWolpe_2010X IDENTICAL GENETIC DUPLICATE CAN THEN BE PUT OUT TO STUD THESE WERE THE FIRST CLONED CALVES THE FIRST CLONED GREY WOLVES AND THEN FINALLY THE FIRST CLONED PIGLETS ALEXIS CHISTA CARREL JANIE AND DOTCOM
PaulWolpe_2010X DRUGS AND OTHER THINGS IN THEIR BODIES THAT WE WANT TO CREATE SO WITH ANTITHROMBIN IN THAT GOAT THAT GOAT HAS BEEN GENETICALLY MODIFIED SO THAT THE MOLECULES OF ITS MILK
PaulWolpe_2010X ACTUALLY INCLUDE THE MOLECULE
PaulWolpe_2010X OF ANTITHROMBIN THAT GTC GENETICS WANTS TO CREATE
PaulWolpe_2010X AND THEN IN ADDITION TRANSGENIC PIGS KNOCKOUT PIGS FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ANIMAL SCIENCE IN SOUTH KOREA ARE PIGS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO USE IN FACT TO TRY TO CREATE ALL KINDS OF
PaulWolpe_2010X DRUGS AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL TYPES OF CHEMICALS THAT THEY WANT THE BLOOD AND THE MILK OF THESE ANIMALS TO PRODUCE FOR THEM INSTEAD OF PRODUCING THEM IN AN INDUSTRIAL WAY
PaulWolpe_2010X THESE ARE TWO CREATURES THAT WERE
PaulWolpe_2010X IS AN ENDANGERED SOUTHEAST ASIAN UNGULATE A SOMATIC CELL A BODY CELL WAS TAKEN
PaulWolpe_2010X BODY
PaulWolpe_2010X WHICH ACTUALLY RAISES AN INTERESTING BIOLOGICAL PROBLEM WE HAVE TWO KINDS OF DNA IN OUR BODIES WE HAVE OUR NUCLEIC DNA THAT EVERYBODY THINKS OF AS OUR DNA BUT WE ALSO HAVE DNA IN OUR MITOCHONDRIA WHICH ARE THE ENERGY PACKETS OF THE CELL THAT DNA IS PASSED DOWN THROUGH OUR MOTHERS
PaulWolpe_2010X SO REALLY WHAT YOU END UP HAVING
PaulWolpe_2010X YET HOW TO SOLVE
PaulWolpe_2010X ELECTRODES IN ITS GANGLIA AND ITS BRAIN
PaulWolpe_2010X AND THEN A TRANSMITTER ON TOP AND IT 'S ON A BIG COMPUTER TRACKING BALL AND NOW USING A JOYSTICK THEY CAN SEND THIS CREATURE AROUND THE LAB
PaulWolpe_2010X AND CONTROL WHETHER IT GOES LEFT OR RIGHT FORWARDS OR BACKWARDS THEY 'VE CREATED A KIND OF INSECT BOT OR BUGBOT IT GETS WORSE THAN THAT OR PERHAPS BETTER THAN THAT
PaulWolpe_2010X THIS ACTUALLY IS ONE OF DARPA 'S VERY IMPORTANT DARPA IS THE DEFENSE RESEARCH AGENCY ONE OF THEIR PROJECTS THESE GOLIATH BEETLES ARE WIRED IN THEIR WINGS THEY HAVE A COMPUTER CHIP STRAPPED TO THEIR BACKS
PaulWolpe_2010X AND THEY CAN FLY THESE CREATURES AROUND THE LAB THEY CAN MAKE THEM GO LEFT RIGHT THEY CAN MAKE THEM TAKE OFF THEY CAN 'T ACTUALLY MAKE THEM LAND THEY PUT THEM ABOUT ONE INCH ABOVE THE GROUND AND THEN THEY SHUT EVERYTHING OFF AND THEY GO PFFT BUT IT 'S THE CLOSEST THEY CAN GET TO A LANDING
PaulWolpe_2010X AND IN FACT THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS GOTTEN SO DEVELOPED THAT THIS CREATURE THIS IS A MOTH THIS IS THE MOTH IN ITS PUPA STAGE AND THAT 'S WHEN THEY PUT THE WIRES IN AND THEY PUT IN THE
PaulWolpe_2010X IT 'S NOT JUST INSECTS THIS IS THE RATBOT OR THE ROBO RAT BY SANJIV TALWAR AT SUNY DOWNSTATE AGAIN IT 'S GOT TECHNOLOGY IT 'S GOT ELECTRODES GOING INTO ITS LEFT AND RIGHT HEMISPHERES IT 'S GOT A CAMERA ON TOP OF ITS HEAD THE SCIENTISTS CAN MAKE THIS
PaulWolpe_2010X CREATURE GO LEFT RIGHT THEY HAVE IT RUNNING THROUGH MAZES CONTROLLING WHERE IT 'S GOING THEY 'VE NOW CREATED AN ORGANIC
PaulWolpe_2010X ROBOT THE GRADUATE STUDENTS IN SANJIV TALWAR 'S LAB SAID IS THIS ETHICAL WE 'VE TAKEN AWAY THE AUTONOMY OF THIS ANIMAL
PaulWolpe_2010X THERE 'S ALSO BEEN WORK DONE WITH MONKEYS THIS IS MIGUEL NICOLELIS OF DUKE HE TOOK OWL MONKEYS
PaulWolpe_2010X WIRED THEM UP SO THAT A COMPUTER WATCHED THEIR BRAINS WHILE THEY MOVED ESPECIALLY LOOKING AT THE MOVEMENT OF THEIR RIGHT ARM THE COMPUTER LEARNED WHAT THE MONKEY BRAIN DID TO MOVE ITS ARM IN VARIOUS WAYS THEY THEN HOOKED IT UP TO A PROSTHETIC ARM WHICH YOU SEE HERE IN THE PICTURE
PaulWolpe_2010X IN THE OTHER ROOM DO WHATEVER THE MONKEY 'S ARM DID THEN HE PUT A VIDEO
PaulWolpe_2010X MONITOR IN THE MONKEY 'S CAGE THAT SHOWED THE MONKEY THIS PROSTHETIC ARM AND THE MONKEY GOT FASCINATED THE MONKEY RECOGNIZED THAT WHATEVER SHE DID WITH HER ARM THIS PROSTHETIC ARM WOULD DO AND EVENTUALLY SHE WAS MOVING
PaulWolpe_2010X TO HAVE THREE INDEPENDENT FUNCTIONAL ARMS
PaulWolpe_2010X PUT THEM ON A CHIP THEY SELF AGGREGATED INTO A NETWORK BECAME AN INTEGRATED CHIP
PaulWolpe_2010X AS THE IT PIECE OF A MECHANISM WHICH RAN A FLIGHT SIMULATOR SO NOW WE HAVE ORGANIC COMPUTER CHIPS MADE OUT OF LIVING SELF AGGREGATING NEURONS
PaulWolpe_2010X INDEPENDENT LAMPREY EEL BRAIN THIS IS A BRAIN FROM A LAMPREY EEL IT IS LIVING FULLY INTACT BRAIN IN A NUTRIENT MEDIUM WITH THESE ELECTRODES GOING OFF
PaulWolpe_2010X TO THE SIDES ATTACHED PHOTOSENSITIVE SENSORS TO THE BRAIN PUT IT INTO A CART HERE 'S THE CART THE BRAIN IS SITTING THERE IN THE MIDDLE AND USING THIS BRAIN AS THE SOLE PROCESSOR FOR THIS CART WHEN YOU TURN ON A LIGHT AND SHINE IT AT THE CART THE CART MOVES TOWARD THE LIGHT WHEN YOU TURN IT OFF IT MOVES AWAY
PaulWolpe_2010X I DON 'T KNOW BUT IN FACT
PaulWolpe_2010X IT IS A FULLY LIVING BRAIN THAT WE HAVE MANAGED TO KEEP ALIVE TO DO OUR BIDDING SO
PaulWolpe_2010X WE ARE NOW AT THE STAGE WHERE WE ARE CREATING CREATURES FOR OUR OWN PURPOSES THIS IS A MOUSE CREATED BY CHARLES VACANTI OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS
PaulWolpe_2010X HE
PaulWolpe_2010X ALTERED THIS MOUSE SO THAT IT WAS GENETICALLY ENGINEERED TO HAVE SKIN THAT WAS LESS IMMUNOREACTIVE TO HUMAN SKIN
PaulWolpe_2010X THIS IS WHERE WE ARE IN THIS PROCESS
PaulWolpe_2010X FINALLY
PaulWolpe_2010X NOT THAT LONG AGO CRAIG VENTER CREATED THE FIRST ARTIFICIAL CELL WHERE HE TOOK A CELL TOOK A DNA SYNTHESIZER WHICH IS A MACHINE CREATED AN ARTIFICIAL GENOME PUT IT IN A DIFFERENT CELL THE GENOME WAS NOT OF THE CELL HE PUT IT IN AND THAT CELL THEN REPRODUCED AS THE OTHER CELL
PaulWolpe_2010X IN OTHER WORDS THAT WAS THE FIRST CREATURE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD THAT HAD A COMPUTER AS ITS PARENT IT DID NOT HAVE AN ORGANIC
PaulWolpe_2010X AND SO WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THIS PLANET WE ARE ABLE TO DIRECTLY DESIGN ORGANISMS WE CAN MANIPULATE THE PLASMAS OF LIFE WITH UNPRECEDENTED POWER
PaulWolpe_2010X AND IT CONFERS ON US A RESPONSIBILITY IS EVERYTHING OKAY IS IT OKAY TO MANIPULATE AND CREATE WHATEVER CREATURES WE WANT
PaulWolpe_2010X DO WE HAVE FREE REIGN TO DESIGN ANIMALS DO WE GET TO GO SOMEDAY TO PETS R US AND SAY LOOK I WANT A DOG I 'D LIKE IT TO HAVE THE HEAD OF A DACHSHUND THE BODY OF A RETRIEVER MAYBE SOME PINK FUR AND LET 'S MAKE IT GLOW IN THE DARK
PaulWolpe_2010X DOES INDUSTRY GET TO CREATE CREATURES WHO IN THEIR MILK IN THEIR BLOOD AND IN THEIR SALIVA AND OTHER BODILY FLUIDS CREATE THE DRUGS AND INDUSTRIAL MOLECULES WE WANT AND THEN WAREHOUSE THEM AS ORGANIC MANUFACTURING MACHINES
PaulWolpe_2010X DO WE GET TO CREATE ORGANIC ROBOTS WHERE WE REMOVE THE AUTONOMY FROM THESE ANIMALS AND TURN THEM JUST INTO OUR
PaulWolpe_2010X IT 'S ALREADY HAPPENING IT 'S NOT SCIENCE FICTION
PaulWolpe_2010X WE ARE NOT ONLY ALREADY USING THESE THINGS IN ANIMALS SOME OF THEM WE 'RE ALREADY BEGINNING TO USE ON OUR OWN BODIES
PaulWolpe_2010X WE ARE NOW TAKING CONTROL OF OUR OWN EVOLUTION WE ARE DIRECTLY DESIGNING THE FUTURE OF THE SPECIES OF THIS PLANET
