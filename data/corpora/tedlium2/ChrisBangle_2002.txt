ChrisBangle_2002@15.80:20.87 I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS AS BACKGROUND IS THE IDEA THAT CARS ARE ART
ChrisBangle_2002@26.93:29.18 LOW ON THE TOTEM POLE WE DON'T DO COFFEE TABLE BOOKS
ChrisBangle_2002@29.45:35.31 ONE LAMP INSIDE OF IT AND CARS ARE THOUGHT SO MUCH AS A PRODUCT THAT IT'S
ChrisBangle_2002@35.83:40.48 TO GET INTO THE AESTHETIC SIDE UNDER THE SAME SORT OF TERMINOLOGY THAT ONE WOULD DISCUSS ART
ChrisBangle_2002@52.79:54.24 THIS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN
ChrisBangle_2002@57.78:59.87 SELF MOVING THINGS RIGHT ELEVATORS ARE
ChrisBangle_2002@61.70:66.94 AND THEY'RE NOT VERY EMOTIONAL THEY SOLVE A PURPOSE AND CERTAINLY AUTOMOBILES HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS
ChrisBangle_2002@67.34:76.02 AND HAVE MADE OUR LIVES FUNCTIONALLY A LOT BETTER IN MANY WAYS THEY'VE ALSO BEEN A REAL PAIN IN THE ASS BECAUSE AUTOMOBILES ARE REALLY THE THING WE HAVE TO SOLVE
ChrisBangle_2002@76.14:83.09 WE HAVE TO SOLVE THE POLLUTION WE HAVE TO SOLVE THE CONGESTION BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT INTERESTS ME IN THIS SPEECH WHAT INTERESTS ME IN THIS SPEECH IS
ChrisBangle_2002@83.43:89.96 CARS AUTOMOBILES MAY BE WHAT YOU USE BUT CARS ARE WHAT WE ARE IN MANY WAYS
ChrisBangle_2002@90.61:92.28 AND AS LONG AS WE CAN
ChrisBangle_2002@92.49:98.24 SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF AUTOMOBILES AND I BELIEVE WE CAN WITH FUEL CELLS OR HYDROGEN LIKE BMW IS REALLY HIP ON
ChrisBangle_2002@110.38:116.50 CARS ARE NOT A SUIT OF CLOTHES CARS ARE AN AVATAR CARS ARE AN EXPANSION OF YOURSELF
ChrisBangle_2002@117.36:129.23 YOUR THOUGHTS YOUR IDEAS YOUR EMOTIONS AND THEY MULTIPLY IT YOUR ANGER WHATEVER IT'S AN AVATAR IT'S A SUPER WALDO THAT YOU HAPPEN TO BE INSIDE OF AND IF YOU FEEL SEXY THE CAR IS SEXY AND IF YOU'RE FULL OF ROAD RAGE YOU'VE GOT
ChrisBangle_2002@129.61:135.65 A CHEVY LIKE A ROCK RIGHT CARS ARE A SCULPTURE DID YOU KNOW THIS THAT EVERY CAR YOU SEE OUT
ChrisBangle_2002@136.31:147.71 BY HAND MANY PEOPLE THINK WELL IT'S COMPUTERS AND IT'S DONE BY MACHINES AND STUFF LIKE THAT WELL THEY REPRODUCE IT BUT THE ORIGINALS ARE ALL DONE BY HAND IT'S DONE BY MEN AND WOMEN WHO BELIEVE A LOT
ChrisBangle_2002@148.75:156.22 AND THEY PUT THAT SAME KIND OF TENSION INTO THE SCULPTING OF A CAR THAT YOU DO IN A GREAT SCULPTURE THAT YOU WOULD GO AND LOOK AT IN A MUSEUM THAT TENSION BETWEEN
ChrisBangle_2002@156.68:163.91 THE NEED TO EXPRESS THE NEED TO DISCOVER THEN YOU PUT SOMETHING NEW INTO IT AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE BOUNDS OF CRAFTSMANSHIP
ChrisBangle_2002@164.55:171.27 RULES THAT SAY THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLE SURFACES THIS IS WHAT CONTROL IS ALL ABOUT THIS IS HOW YOU SHOW YOU'RE A MASTER OF YOUR CRAFT
ChrisBangle_2002@179.41:184.89 AS IT IS IN ANYTHING WE WORK IN CLAY WHICH HASN'T CHANGED MUCH SINCE MICHELANGELO STARTED SCREWING AROUND WITH IT
ChrisBangle_2002@185.80:189.04 AND THERE'S A VERY INTERESTING ANALOGY TO THAT TOO REAL QUICKLY
ChrisBangle_2002@211.59:212.87 YOU HAVE TO TOUCH ABOUT IT
ChrisBangle_2002@213.91:224.15 THAT'S THE SCULPTURE THAT GOES INTO IT THAT SENSUALITY AND IT'S DONE BY MEN AND WOMEN WORKING JUST LIKE THIS MAKING CARS NOW THIS LITTLE QUOTE ABOUT SCULPTURE FROM HENRY MOORE
ChrisBangle_2002@224.22:240.04 I BELIEVE THAT THAT PRESSURE WITHIN THAT MOORE 'S TALKING ABOUT AT LEAST WHEN IT COMES TO CARS COMES RIGHT BACK TO THIS IDEA OF THE MEAN IT'S THAT WILL TO LIVE THAT NEED TO SURVIVE TO EXPRESS ITSELF THAT COMES IN A CAR AND TAKES OVER PEOPLE LIKE ME AND WE TELL OTHER PEOPLE DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS UNTIL THIS THING COMES ALIVE
ChrisBangle_2002@248.29:257.48 AT THE HEART OF ALL OF IT AND IT'S REALLY WHAT PUTS THE CRAFTSMANSHIP INTO OUR CARS AND IT'S NOT A WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT REALLY WHEN THEY'RE WORKING LIKE THIS OR WHEN SOMEBODY WORKS LIKE THIS
ChrisBangle_2002@258.77:266.64 THAT SAME KIND OF COMMITMENT THAT SAME KIND OF BEAUTY NOW NOW I GET TO THE POINT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT CARS AS ART ART IN THE PLATONIC SENSE IS TRUTH
ChrisBangle_2002@266.89:276.91 IT'S BEAUTY AND LOVE NOW THIS IS REALLY WHERE DESIGNERS IN CAR BUSINESS DIVERGE FROM THE ENGINEERS WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM TALKING ABOUT LOVE WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM TALKING ABOUT TRUTH OR
ChrisBangle_2002@277.11:280.89 BEAUTY IN THAT SENSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEARCHING FOR WHEN WE'RE WORKING OUR
ChrisBangle_2002@281.50:289.38 WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO FIND THAT TRUTH OUT THERE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO FIND VANITY AND BEAUTY WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE BEAUTY IN THE TRUTH HOWEVER ENGINEERS TEND TO LOOK AT THINGS A LITTLE BIT MORE
ChrisBangle_2002@290.16:297.37 NEWTONIAN INSTEAD OF THIS QUANTUM APPROACH WE'RE DEALING WITH IRRATIONALISMS AND WE'RE DEALING WITH PARADOXES THAT WE ADMIT EXIST AND THE ENGINEERS
ChrisBangle_2002@302.72:306.63 BETTER AND THAT SOMETIMES LEADS TO BIT OF A DIVERGENCE
ChrisBangle_2002@307.56:309.05 IN WHY WE'RE DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING
ChrisBangle_2002@317.26:325.55 THE FEMALE SIDE TO THAT THAT'S OK THAT'S COOL YOU GO OFF AND BE MANLY WE'RE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE FEMALE BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN IS
ChrisBangle_2002@325.90:333.91 FINDING FORM THAT'S MORE THAN JUST A FUNCTION WE'RE INTERESTED IN FINDING BEAUTY THAT'S MORE THAN JUST AN AESTHETIC IT'S REALLY A TRUTH
ChrisBangle_2002@334.14:348.45 AND I THINK THIS IDEA OF SOUL AS BEING AT THE HEART OF GREAT CARS IS VERY APPLICABLE YOU ALL KNOW IT YOU KNOW A CAR WHEN YOU'VE SEEN IT WITH SOUL YOU KNOW HOW STRONG THIS IS WELL THIS EXPERIENCE OF LOVE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF DESIGN TO ME ARE INTERCHANGEABLE AND NOW I'M COMING TO MY STORY
ChrisBangle_2002@349.13:352.09 I DISCOVERED SOMETHING ABOUT LOVE AND DESIGN
ChrisBangle_2002@355.27:364.48 AND FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE TO GO WITH ME FOR A SECOND AND SAY YOU KNOW YOU COULD TAKE THE WORD LOVE OUT OF A LOT OF THINGS IN OUR SOCIETY PUT THE WORD DESIGN IN AND IT STILL WORKS LIKE THIS QUOTE HERE
ChrisBangle_2002@365.75:377.95 WORKS YOU KNOW YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IT WORKS IN TRUISMS ALL IS FAIR IN DESIGN AND WAR CERTAINLY WE LIVE IN A COMPETITIVE SOCIETY I THINK THIS ONE HERE THERE'S A POP SONG THAT REALLY DESCRIBES PHILIPPE STARCK FOR ME
ChrisBangle_2002@389.86:393.43 THIS IS ONE SUBSTITUTION THAT I BELIEVE ALL OF US IN DESIGN MANAGEMENT ARE GUILTY OF
ChrisBangle_2002@394.43:396.76 AND THIS IDEA THAT THERE IS
ChrisBangle_2002@397.02:398.27 MORE TO LOVE
ChrisBangle_2002@399.14:406.59 MORE TO DESIGN WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO YOUR NEIGHBOR YOUR OTHER IT CAN BE PHYSICAL LIKE THIS AND MAYBE IN THE FUTURE IT WILL BE
ChrisBangle_2002@407.04:414.69 RIGHT NOW IT'S IN DEALING WITH OUR OWN PEOPLE OUR OWN TEAMS WHO ARE DOING THE CREATING SO TO MY STORY THE IDEA OF
ChrisBangle_2002@415.04:420.43 PEOPLE WORK IS WHAT WE WORK WITH HERE AND I HAVE TO MAKE A BOND WITH MY DESIGNERS WHEN WE'RE CREATING BMWS
ChrisBangle_2002@420.83:426.41 WE HAVE TO HAVE A SHARED INTIMACY A SHARED VISION THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO WORK AS ONE FAMILY WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND OURSELVES THAT WAY
ChrisBangle_2002@445.40:450.87 TO DO THIS AND BECAUSE THESE ARE ARTISTS THEY HAVE VERY ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENTS
ChrisBangle_2002@452.67:459.43 NOW ONE THING ABOUT ART IS ART IS DISCOVERY AND ART IS DISCOVERING YOURSELF THROUGH YOUR ART RIGHT AND ONE THING ABOUT CARS IS
ChrisBangle_2002@460.06:472.25 WE'RE ALL A LITTLE BIT LIKE PYGMALION WE ARE COMPLETELY IN LOVE WITH OUR OWN CREATIONS THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PAINTINGS IT REALLY DESCRIBES OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CARS THIS IS SICK BEYOND BELIEF
ChrisBangle_2002@476.05:482.00 THE INTIMACY WITH WHICH WE WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM TAKES ON A NEW DIMENSION A NEW MEANING
ChrisBangle_2002@482.46:494.74 WE HAVE A SHARED CENTER WE HAVE A SHARED FOCUS THAT CAR STAYS AT THE MIDDLE OF ALL OUR RELATIONSHIPS AND IT'S MY JOB IN THE COMPETITIVE PROCESS TO NARROW THIS DOWN
ChrisBangle_2002@506.08:512.05 TEN CARS WE NARROW IT DOWN TO FIVE CARS DOWN TO THREE CARS DOWN TO TWO CARS DOWN TO ONE CAR AND I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT
ChrisBangle_2002@512.43:521.37 KILLING BASICALLY SOMEONE 'S LOVE SOMEONE 'S BABY THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BOND WITH YOUR TEAM THAT PERMITS YOU TO DO THIS
ChrisBangle_2002@529.98:543.28 WELL THIS PROJECT DEEP BLUE PUT ME IN CONTACT WITH MY TEAM IN A WAY THAT I NEVER EXPECTED AND I WANT TO PASS IT ON TO YOU BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO REFLECT ON THIS PERHAPS IN YOUR OWN RELATIONSHIPS WE WANTED TO A DO A CAR WHICH WAS A COMPLETE LEAP OF FAITH FOR BMW
ChrisBangle_2002@543.51:552.43 WE WANTED TO DO A TEAM WHICH WAS SO REMOVED FROM THE WAY WE'D DONE IT THAT I ONLY HAD A PHONE NUMBER THAT CONNECTED ME TO THEM SO WHAT WE DID WAS
ChrisBangle_2002@568.15:569.04 WITH THIS TEAM NAME
ChrisBangle_2002@569.16:576.03 DEEP BLUE NOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW DEEP BLUE FROM IBM WE ACTUALLY STOLE IT FROM THEM BECAUSE WE FIGURED IF ANYBODY READ OUR FAXES THEY'D THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COMPUTERS
ChrisBangle_2002@587.66:596.15 AND WE GAVE THEM A BUDGET WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A SET OF DELIVERABLES A TIMETABLE AND NOTHING ELSE LIKE I SAID I JUST HAD A PHONE NUMBER THAT CONNECTED ME TO THEM AND A GROUP OF ENGINEERS
ChrisBangle_2002@596.58:604.64 WORKED IN GERMANY AND THE IDEA WAS THEY WOULD WORK SEPARATELY ON THIS PROBLEM OF WHAT'S THE SUCCESSOR TO THE SUV THEY WOULD COME TOGETHER COMPARE NOTES THEN THEY WOULD WORK
ChrisBangle_2002@604.88:614.21 APART COME TOGETHER AND THEY WOULD PRODUCE TOGETHER A MONUMENTAL SET OF DIVERSE OPINIONS THAT DIDN'T POLLUTE EACH OTHERS IDEAS BUT AT THE SAME TIME CAME TOGETHER AND RESOLVED THE PROBLEMS
ChrisBangle_2002@614.78:620.20 HOPEFULLY REALLY UNDERSTAND THE CUSTOMER AT IT'S HEART WHERE THE CUSTOMER IS LIVE WITH THEM IN AMERICA
ChrisBangle_2002@620.48:627.72 SO SENT THE TEAM OFF AND ACTUALLY SOMETHING DIFFERENT HAPPENED THEY WENT OTHER PLACES
ChrisBangle_2002@629.77:637.97 THEY DISAPPEARED QUITE HONESTLY AND ALL I GOT WAS POSTCARDS NOW I GOT SOME
ChrisBangle_2002@638.29:647.03 POSTCARDS OF THESE GUYS IN LAS VEGAS AND I GOT SOME POSTCARDS OF THESE GUYS IN THE GRAND CANYON AND I GOT THESE POSTCARDS OF NIAGARA FALLS AND PRETTY SOON THEY'RE IN NEW YORK AND I DON'T KNOW
ChrisBangle_2002@647.86:655.40 AND I'M TELLING MYSELF THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT CAR THEY'RE DOING RESEARCH THAT I'VE NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT BEFORE
ChrisBangle_2002@658.99:670.69 THEY DECIDED THAT INSTEAD OF LIKE HAVING A STUDIO AND SIX OR SEVEN APARTMENTS IT WAS CHEAPER TO RENT ELIZABETH TAYLOR 'S EX HOUSE IN MALIBU
ChrisBangle_2002@672.77:681.31 AT LEAST THEY TOLD ME IT WAS HER HOUSE I GUESS IT WAS AT ONE TIME SHE HAD A PARTY THERE OR SOMETHING BUT ANYWAY THIS WAS THE HOUSE AND THEY ALL LIVED THERE
ChrisBangle_2002@681.81:691.55 NOW THIS IS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN LIVING HALF A DOZEN PEOPLE WHO 'D LEFT THEIR SOME HAD LEFT THEIR WIVES BEHIND AND FAMILIES BEHIND AND THEY LITERALLY LIVED IN THIS HOUSE
ChrisBangle_2002@692.01:699.65 FOR THE ENTIRE SIX MONTHS THE PROJECT WAS IN AMERICA BUT THE FIRST THREE MONTHS WERE THE MOST INTENSIVE AND ONE OF THE YOUNG WOMEN IN THE PROJECT
ChrisBangle_2002@701.77:713.35 SHE ACTUALLY BUILT HER ROOM IN THE BATHROOM THE BATHROOM WAS SO BIG SHE BUILT THE BED OVER THE BATHTUB IT'S QUITE FASCINATING ON THE OTHER HAND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS OK NOTHING
ChrisBangle_2002@713.60:719.03 THIS IS ALL GOING ON AND ALL I'M GETTING IS POSTCARDS OF THESE GUYS IN LAS VEGAS OR WHATEVER SAYING DON 'T WORRY CHRIS THIS IS REALLY GOING TO BE GOOD
ChrisBangle_2002@719.77:732.57 OK SO MY CONCEPT OF WHAT A DESIGN STUDIO WAS PROBABLY I WASN'T UP TO SPEED ON WHERE THESE GUYS WERE HOWEVER THE ENGINEERS BACK IN MUNICH HAD TAKEN ON THIS KIND OF NEWTONIAN
ChrisBangle_2002@741.28:754.37 MODERN CONSUMER AND ONE WAS HOPING THAT THESE TWO TEAMS WOULD GET TOGETHER AND THIS COLLUSION OF INCREDIBLE CREATIVITY UNDER THESE INCREDIBLE SURROUNDINGS AND THESE INCREDIBLY STRESSED OUT ENGINEERS WOULD CREATE SOME INCREDIBLE SOLUTIONS
ChrisBangle_2002@767.09:774.19 THAT POINT YOU HAVE A SPLIT IN YOUR DIALOG THAT IS SO DEEP AND SO FAR THAT
ChrisBangle_2002@774.43:784.39 THEY CANNOT BRING THIS TOGETHER AT ALL AND SO WE HAD OUR FIRST MEETING AFTER THREE MONTHS IN TIBURON WHICH IS JUST UP THE ROAD FROM HERE YOU KNOW TIBURON AND
ChrisBangle_2002@784.64:792.46 THE IDEA WAS AFTER THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THIS INDEPENDENT RESEARCH THEY WOULD PRESENT IT ALL TO DOCTOR GOSCHEL WHO IS NOW MY BOSS AND AT THAT TIME HE WAS CO MENTOR ON THE PROJECT
ChrisBangle_2002@801.26:807.84 TO THE SUV IN AMERICA AND SO I HAD THESE IDEAS IN MY HEAD THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT I MEAN I'M GOING TO SEE SO MUCH WORK IT'S SO INTENSE I
ChrisBangle_2002@817.67:824.95 SO WE WENT TO TIBURON AFTER THREE MONTHS AND THE TEAM HAD GOTTEN TOGETHER THE WEEK BEFORE MANY DAYS AHEAD OF TIME
ChrisBangle_2002@825.38:832.72 THE ENGINEERS FLEW OVER AND DESIGNERS GOT TOGETHER WITH THEM AND THEY PUT THEIR PRESENTATION TOGETHER
ChrisBangle_2002@833.28:841.54 WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT THE ENGINEERS HADN'T DONE ANYTHING AND THEY HADN'T DONE ANYTHING BECAUSE
ChrisBangle_2002@841.69:849.62 KIND OF LIKE IN CAR BUSINESS ENGINEERS ARE THERE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND WE WERE ASKING THEM TO CREATE A PROBLEM
ChrisBangle_2002@850.33:857.82 AND THE ENGINEERS WERE WAITING FOR THE DESIGNERS TO SAY THIS IS THE PROBLEM THAT WE'VE CREATED NOW HELP US SOLVE IT AND
ChrisBangle_2002@868.85:870.78 WALK OUT WE'LL WALK
ChrisBangle_2002@879.63:886.74 WE SPENT FOUR HOURS BEING TOLD ALL ABOUT VOCABULARY THAT NEEDS TO BE BUILT BETWEEN ENGINEERS AND DESIGNERS
ChrisBangle_2002@887.25:898.43 AND HERE I'M EXPECTING AT ANY MOMENT OK THEY'RE GOING TO TURN THE PAGE AND I'M GOING TO SEE THE CARS I'M GOING TO SEE THE SKETCHES I'M GOING TO SEE MAYBE SOME IDEA OF WHERE IT'S GOING DIALOG KEPT ON GOING WITH MENTAL MAPS OF WORDS
ChrisBangle_2002@899.14:905.91 AND PRETTY SOON IT WAS BECOMING OBVIOUS THAT INSTEAD OF BEING DAZZLED WITH BRILLIANCE I WAS SERIOUSLY BEING BAFFLED WITH BULLSHIT
ChrisBangle_2002@907.28:915.99 AND IF YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT THIS IS LIKE TO HAVE THESE MONTHS OF POSTCARD INDICATION OF HOW GREAT THIS TEAM IS WORKING AND THEY'RE OUT THERE SPENDING ALL THIS MONEY AND THEY'RE LEARNING AND THEY'RE DOING ALL
ChrisBangle_2002@928.99:942.79 AFTER FOUR HOURS OF THIS I STOOD UP AND I TOOK THIS TEAM APART I SCREAMED AT THEM I YELLED AT THEM WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING YOU'RE LETTING ME DOWN YOU'RE MY DESIGNERS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE CREATIVE ONES WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON AROUND HERE
ChrisBangle_2002@943.35:947.89 IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF MY BETTER TIRADES I HAVE SOME GOOD ONES BUT THIS WAS PROBABLY ONE OF MY BETTER ONES
ChrisBangle_2002@948.23:960.38 AND I WENT INTO THESE PEOPLE HOW COULD THEY TAKE BMW 'S MONEY HOW COULD THEY HAVE A HOLIDAY FOR THREE MONTHS AND PRODUCE NOTHING NOTHING BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY DIDN'T TELL US
ChrisBangle_2002@960.59:971.32 THAT THEY HAD THREE STATION WAGONS FULL OF DRAWINGS MODEL CONCEPTS PICTURES EVERYTHING I WANTED THEY'D LOCKED UP IN THE CARS
ChrisBangle_2002@971.94:980.72 BECAUSE THEY HAD SHOWN SOLIDARITY WITH THE ENGINEERS AND THEY'D DECIDED NOT TO SHOW ME ANYTHING IN ORDER TO GIVE THE CHANCE FOR PROBLEM SOLVING A CHANCE TO START
ChrisBangle_2002@1000.94:1005.89 AND I WAS JUST FUCKING FURIOUS FURIOUS OK
ChrisBangle_2002@1007.18:1014.04 BECAUSE THEY HAD ALL THE FUN AND I DIDN 'T YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FURIOUS ABOUT RIGHT AND SOMEBODY ASKED ME ABOUT CATHERINE MY WIFE YOU KNOW DID SHE
ChrisBangle_2002@1016.02:1029.78 AND IT TRIGGERED A SET OF THOUGHTS ABOUT MY WIFE AND I RECALLED THAT WHEN CATHERINE AND I WERE MARRIED THE PRIEST GAVE A VERY NICE SERMON AND HE SAID SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HE SAID LOVE IS NOT SELFISH
ChrisBangle_2002@1030.39:1044.00 HE SAID LOVE DOES NOT MEAN COUNTING HOW MANY TIMES I SAY I LOVE YOU IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAD SEX THIS MANY TIMES THIS MONTH AND IT'S TWO TIMES LESS THAN LAST MONTH SO THAT MEANS YOU DON'T LOVE ME AS MUCH LOVE IS NOT SELFISH
ChrisBangle_2002@1044.58:1045.84 AND I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS
ChrisBangle_2002@1046.18:1050.36 AND I THOUGHT YOU KNOW I'M NOT SHOWING LOVE HERE
ChrisBangle_2002@1053.43:1057.69 NOT SHOWING LOVE I'M IN THE AIR I'M IN THE AIR
ChrisBangle_2002@1058.90:1060.54 THIS CANNOT BE
ChrisBangle_2002@1060.66:1075.02 THIS CANNOT BE THAT I'M EXPECTING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SKETCHES AND TO ME THAT'S MY QUANTIFICATION METHOD FOR QUALIFYING A TEAM THIS CANNOT BE SO I TOLD THEM THIS STORY I SAID GUYS I'M THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING HERE THIS ISN'T RIGHT
ChrisBangle_2002@1075.41:1086.30 I CAN'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU GUYS BASED ON A PREMISE THAT IS A QUANTIFIABLE ONE BASED ON A DICTATE PREMISE THAT SAYS I 'M A BOSS YOU DO WHAT I SAY
ChrisBangle_2002@1087.14:1092.53 WITHOUT TRUST I SAID THIS CAN'T BE ACTUALLY WE
ChrisBangle_2002@1093.70:1096.26 ALL BROKE DOWN INTO TEARS TO BE QUITE HONEST ABOUT IT
ChrisBangle_2002@1097.10:1098.76 BECAUSE THEY STILL
ChrisBangle_2002@1098.85:1110.70 COULD NOT TELL ME HOW MUCH FRUSTRATION THEY HAD BUILT UP INSIDE OF THEM NOT BEING ABLE TO SHOW ME WHAT I WANTED AND MERELY HAVING TO ASK ME TO TRUST THEM THAT IT WOULD COME
ChrisBangle_2002@1111.56:1118.53 AND I THINK WE FELT MUCH CLOSER THAT DAY WE CUT A LOT OF STRINGS THAT DIDN'T NEED TO BE THERE AND WE FORGED THE CONCEPT FOR
ChrisBangle_2002@1118.80:1126.15 WHAT REAL TEAM AND CREATIVITY IS ALL ABOUT WE PUT THE CAR BACK AT THE CENTER OF OUR THOUGHTS AND WE PUT LOVE
ChrisBangle_2002@1126.61:1134.67 I THINK TRULY BACK INTO THE CENTER OF THE PROCESS BY THE WAY THAT TEAM WENT ON TO CREATE SIX DIFFERENT CONCEPTS FOR THE NEXT MODEL OF WHAT WOULD BE THE
ChrisBangle_2002@1144.22:1147.92 THE X COUPE THEY HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH THAT
ChrisBangle_2002@1148.91:1159.75 IT WAS THE RENDITION OF OUR MOTORCYCLE THE GS AS CARL MAGNUSSON SAYS BRUTE IFUL AS THE IDEA OF WHAT COULD BE A MOTORCYCLE IF YOU ADD TWO MORE WHEELS
ChrisBangle_2002@1160.28:1173.86 AND SO IN CONCLUSION MY LESSON THAT I WANTED TO PASS ON TO YOU WAS THIS ONE HERE I'M ALSO GOING TO STEAL A LITTLE QUOTE OUT OF LITTLE PRINCE THERE'S A LOT TO BE SAID ABOUT TRUST AND LOVE IF YOU KNOW THAT THOSE TWO WORDS ARE SYNONYMOUS FOR DESIGN
ChrisBangle_2002@1174.48:1184.18 I HAD A VERY VERY MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH MY TEAM THAT DAY AND IT'S STAYED THAT WAY EVER SINCE AND I HOPE THAT YOU TOO FIND THAT THERE'S MORE TO DESIGN AND
