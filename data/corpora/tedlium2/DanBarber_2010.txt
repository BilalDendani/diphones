DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 SO I 'VE KNOWN A LOT OF FISH IN MY LIFE
DanBarber_2010 I 'VE LOVED ONLY TWO
DanBarber_2010 THAT FIRST ONE WAS A
DanBarber_2010 IT WAS MORE LIKE A PASSIONATE AFFAIR
DanBarber_2010 IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL FISH
DanBarber_2010 FLAVORFUL TEXTURED
DanBarber_2010 MEATY A BEST SELLER ON THE MENU WHAT A FISH
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 EVEN BETTER IT WAS FARM RAISED TO THE SUPPOSED HIGHEST STANDARDS OF SUSTAINABILITY
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 SO YOU COULD FEEL GOOD ABOUT SELLING IT
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 I WAS IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS BEAUTY FOR SEVERAL MONTHS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 ONE DAY THE HEAD OF THE COMPANY CALLED AND ASKED IF I 'D SPEAK AT AN EVENT
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 ABOUT THE FARM 'S SUSTAINABILITY ABSOLUTELY I SAID
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 HERE WAS A COMPANY TRYING TO SOLVE
DanBarber_2010 WHAT 'S BECOME THIS UNIMAGINABLE PROBLEM FOR OUR CHEFS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 HOW DO WE KEEP FISH ON OUR MENUS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 FOR THE PAST FIFTY YEARS WE 'VE BEEN FISHING THE SEAS
DanBarber_2010 LIKE WE CLEAR CUT FORESTS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 IT 'S HARD TO OVERSTATE THE DESTRUCTION
DanBarber_2010 NINETY PERCENT OF LARGE FISH THE ONES WE LOVE THE TUNAS THE HALIBUTS THE SALMONS SWORDFISH THEY 'VE COLLAPSED THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 SO FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE AQUACULTURE FISH FARMING IS GOING TO BE A PART OF OUR FUTURE
DanBarber_2010 A LOT OF ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT
DanBarber_2010 FISH FARMS POLLUTE
DanBarber_2010 MOST OF THEM DO ANYWAY AND THEY 'RE INEFFICIENT TAKE TUNA A MAJOR DRAWBACK
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 IT 'S GOT A FEED CONVERSION RATIO OF FIFTEEN TO ONE THAT MEANS IT TAKES FIFTEEN POUNDS OF WILD FISH TO GET YOU ONE POUND OF FARM TUNA
DanBarber_2010 NOT VERY SUSTAINABLE DOESN 'T TASTE VERY GOOD EITHER
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 SO HERE FINALLY
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 WAS A COMPANY TRYING TO DO IT RIGHT I WANTED TO SUPPORT THEM
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THE DAY BEFORE THE EVENT I CALLED THE HEAD OF PR FOR THE COMPANY
DanBarber_2010 LET 'S CALL HIM DON
DanBarber_2010 DON I SAID JUST TO GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT YOU GUYS ARE FAMOUS FOR FOR FARMING SO FAR OUT TO SEA YOU YOU DON 'T POLLUTE THAT 'S RIGHT HE SAID WE 'RE SO FAR OUT
DanBarber_2010 THE WASTE FROM OUR FISH GETS DISTRIBUTED
DanBarber_2010 NOT CONCENTRATED AND THEN HE ADDED
DanBarber_2010 WE 'RE BASICALLY A WORLD UNTO OURSELVES
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THAT FEED CONVERSION RATIO TWO POINT FIVE TO ONE HE SAID BEST IN THE BUSINESS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 TWO POINT FIVE TO ONE GREAT TWO POINT FIVE TO ONE WHAT WHAT ARE YOU FEEDING SUSTAINABLE PROTEINS HE SAID
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 GREAT I SAID GOT OFF THE PHONE
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 AND THAT NIGHT I WAS LYING IN BED AND I THOUGHT
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 WHAT THE HELL IS A SUSTAINABLE PROTEIN
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 SO THE NEXT DAY JUST BEFORE THE EVENT I CALLED DON I SAID DON WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF SUSTAINABLE PROTEINS HE SAID HE DIDN 'T KNOW
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 HE WOULD ASK AROUND WELL I GOT ON THE PHONE WITH A FEW PEOPLE IN THE COMPANY NO ONE COULD GIVE ME A STRAIGHT ANSWER
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 UNTIL FINALLY I GOT ON THE PHONE WITH THE HEAD BIOLOGIST
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 LET 'S CALL HIM DON TOO
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 DON I SAID WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF SUSTAINABLE PROTEINS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 WELL HE MENTIONED SOME ALGAES
DanBarber_2010 AND SOME FISH MEALS AND THEN HE SAID CHICKEN PELLETS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 I SAID CHICKEN PELLETS HE SAID YEAH FEATHERS SKIN
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 BONE MEAL SCRAPS DRIED AND PROCESSED INTO FEED
DanBarber_2010 I SAID WHAT PERCENTAGE
DanBarber_2010 OF YOUR FEED IS CHICKEN
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THINKING YOU KNOW TWO PERCENT
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 WELL IT 'S ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT HE SAID
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 I SAID DON
DanBarber_2010 WHAT 'S SUSTAINABLE ABOUT FEEDING CHICKEN TO FISH
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THERE THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE ON THE LINE
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 AND HE SAID THERE 'S JUST TOO MUCH CHICKEN IN THE WORLD
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 I FELL OUT OF LOVE WITH THIS FISH
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 NO NOT BECAUSE I 'M SOME SELF RIGHTEOUS GOODY TWO SHOES FOODIE
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 I ACTUALLY AM
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 NO I FELL OUT OF LOVE WITH THIS FISH BECAUSE I SWEAR TO GOD AFTER THAT CONVERSATION THE FISH TASTED LIKE CHICKEN
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THIS SECOND FISH
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 IT 'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE STORY
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 IT 'S THE ROMANTIC KIND
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THE KIND WHERE THE MORE YOU GET TO KNOW YOUR FISH YOU LOVE THE FISH
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 I FIRST ATE IT AT A RESTAURANT IN SOUTHERN SPAIN
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 A JOURNALIST FRIEND HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FISH FOR A LONG TIME
DanBarber_2010 SHE KIND OF SET US UP
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 OK IT CAME TO THE TABLE A BRIGHT
DanBarber_2010 ALMOST SHIMMERING WHITE COLOR
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THE CHEF HAD OVERCOOKED IT LIKE TWICE OVER OK AMAZINGLY IT WAS STILL DELICIOUS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 WHO CAN MAKE A FISH TASTE GOOD
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 AFTER IT 'S BEEN OVERCOOKED
DanBarber_2010 I CAN 'T BUT THIS GUY CAN
DanBarber_2010 LET 'S CALL HIM MIGUEL ACTUALLY HIS NAME IS MIGUEL
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 AND NO HE DIDN 'T COOK THE FISH AND HE 'S NOT A CHEF AT LEAST IN THE WAY THAT YOU AND I UNDERSTAND IT
DanBarber_2010 HE 'S A BIOLOGIST
DanBarber_2010 AT VETA LA PALMA IT 'S A FISH FARM IN THE SOUTHWESTERN CORNER OF SPAIN
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 IT 'S AT THE TIP OF THE GUADALQUIVIR RIVER
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 UNTIL THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE FARM WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE ARGENTINIANS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THEY RAISED BEEF CATTLE ON WHAT WAS ESSENTIALLY WETLANDS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THEY DID IT BY DRAINING THE LAND THEY BUILT THIS INTRICATE SERIES OF CANALS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 AND THEY PUSHED WATER OFF THE LAND AND OUT INTO THE RIVER
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 WELL THEY COULDN 'T MAKE IT WORK NOT ECONOMICALLY
DanBarber_2010 AND ECOLOGICALLY IT WAS A DISASTER
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 KILLED LIKE NINETY PERCENT OF THE BIRDS WHICH FOR THIS PLACE IS A LOT OF BIRDS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 AND SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 A SPANISH COMPANY WITH AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIENCE PURCHASED THE LAND WHAT DID THEY DO
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THEY REVERSED THE FLOW OF WATER THEY LITERALLY FLIPPED THE SWITCH
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 INSTEAD OF PUSHING WATER OUT
DanBarber_2010 THEY USED THE CHANNELS TO PULL WATER BACK IN THEY FLOODED THE CANALS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THEY CREATED A TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND ACRE FISH FARM
DanBarber_2010 BASS MULLET SHRIMP EEL
DanBarber_2010 AND IN THE PROCESS MIGUEL AND THIS COMPANY
DanBarber_2010 COMPLETELY REVERSED THE ECOLOGICAL DESTRUCTION
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THE FARM 'S INCREDIBLE I MEAN YOU 'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 YOU STARE OUT AT A HORIZON THAT IS A MILLION MILES AWAY AND ALL YOU SEE ARE FLOODED CANALS AND THIS THICK RICH MARSHLAND
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 I WAS THERE NOT LONG AGO WITH MIGUEL
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 HE 'S AN AMAZING GUY
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 LIKE THREE PARTS CHARLES DARWIN AND ONE PART CROCODILE DUNDEE
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 OKAY
DanBarber_2010 THERE WE ARE SLOGGING THROUGH THE WETLANDS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 AND I 'M PANTING AND SWEATING GOT MUD UP TO MY KNEES AND MIGUEL 'S CALMLY CONDUCTING A BIOLOGY LECTURE
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 HERE HE 'S POINTING OUT A RARE BLACK SHOULDERED KITE
DanBarber_2010 NOW HE 'S MENTIONING
DanBarber_2010 THE MINERAL NEEDS OF PHYTOPLANKTON
DanBarber_2010 AND HERE HERE HE SEES A GROUPING PATTERN THAT REMINDS HIM OF THE TANZANIAN GIRAFFE
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 IT TURNS OUT MIGUEL SPENT THE BETTER PART OF HIS CAREER IN THE MIKUMI NATIONAL PARK IN AFRICA
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 I ASKED HIM HOW HE BECAME SUCH AN EXPERT ON FISH HE SAID FISH
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 I DIDN 'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FISH
DanBarber_2010 I 'M AN EXPERT IN RELATIONSHIPS
DanBarber_2010 AND THEN HE 'S OFF
DanBarber_2010 LAUNCHING INTO MORE TALK ABOUT RARE BIRDS AND ALGAES AND STRANGE AQUATIC PLANTS AND DON 'T GET ME WRONG THAT WAS REALLY FASCINATING YOU KNOW THE BIOTIC COMMUNITY UNPLUGGED KIND OF THING YOU KNOW IT 'S GREAT
DanBarber_2010 BUT I WAS IN LOVE AND MY HEAD
DanBarber_2010 WAS SWOONING OVER THAT OVERCOOKED PIECE OF DELICIOUS FISH I HAD THE NIGHT BEFORE SO I INTERRUPTED HIM I SAID MIGUEL WHAT MAKES YOUR FISH TASTE SO GOOD
DanBarber_2010 HE POINTED AT THE ALGAE
DanBarber_2010 I KNOW DUDE THE ALGAE THE PHYTOPLANKTON THE RELATIONSHIPS IT 'S AMAZING
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 BUT WHAT ARE YOUR FISH EATING WHAT 'S THE FEED CONVERSION RATIO
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 WELL HE GOES ON TO TELL ME
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 IT 'S SUCH A RICH SYSTEM
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THAT THE FISH ARE EATING WHAT THEY 'D BE EATING IN THE WILD
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THE PLANT BIOMASS THE PHYTOPLANKTON THE ZOOPLANKTON IT 'S WHAT FEEDS THE FISH THE SYSTEM IS SO HEALTHY IT 'S TOTALLY SELF RENEWING THERE
DanBarber_2010 THERE IS NO FEED
DanBarber_2010 EVER HEARD OF A FARM THAT DOESN 'T FEED ITS ANIMALS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 LATER THAT DAY I WAS DRIVING AROUND THIS PROPERTY WITH MIGUEL AND I ASKED HIM I SAID FOR A PLACE THAT SEEMS SO NATURAL
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 UNLIKE LIKE ANY FISH ANY FARM I 'D EVER BEEN AT
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 HOW DO YOU MEASURE SUCCESS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 AT THAT MOMENT IT WAS AS IF A FILM DIRECTOR CALLED FOR A SET CHANGE AND WE ROUNDED THE CORNER AND SAW THE MOST AMAZING SIGHT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PINK FLAMINGOS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 A LITERAL PINK CARPET FOR AS FAR AS YOU COULD SEE
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THAT 'S SUCCESS HE SAID
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 LOOK AT THEIR BELLIES PINK THEY 'RE FEASTING
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 FEASTING I WAS TOTALLY CONFUSED I SAID MIGUEL AREN 'T THEY FEASTING ON YOUR FISH
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 YES HE SAID
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 WE LOSE TWENTY PERCENT OF OUR FISH AND FISH EGGS TO BIRDS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 WELL THE LAST YEAR THIS PROPERTY HAD SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND BIRDS ON IT
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIFFERENT SPECIES IT 'S BECOME TODAY THE LARGEST
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 PRIVATE BIRD SANCTUARIES IN ALL OF EUROPE
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 I SAID MIGUEL ISN 'T A THRIVING BIRD POPULATION LIKE THE LAST THING YOU WANT ON A FISH FARM
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 HE SHOOK HIS HEAD NO HE SAID
DanBarber_2010 WE FARM EXTENSIVELY
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 NOT INTENSIVELY
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THIS IS AN ECOLOGICAL NETWORK
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THE FLAMINGOS EAT THE SHRIMP THE SHRIMP EAT THE PHYTOPLANKTON SO THE PINKER THE BELLY THE BETTER THE SYSTEM
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 OKAY SO LET 'S REVIEW A FARM THAT DOESN 'T FEED ITS ANIMALS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 AND A FARM THAT MEASURES ITS SUCCESS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 ON THE HEALTH OF ITS PREDATORS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 A FISH FARM BUT ALSO A BIRD SANCTUARY
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 OH AND BY THE WAY THOSE FLAMINGOS THEY SHOULDN 'T EVEN BE THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THEY BROOD IN A TOWN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES AWAY WHERE THE SOIL CONDITIONS ARE BETTER FOR BUILDING NESTS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 EVERY MORNING THEY FLY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES INTO THE FARM
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 AND EVERY EVENING THEY FLY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES BACK
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THEY DO THAT BECAUSE THEY 'RE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE BROKEN WHITE LINE OF HIGHWAY A NINETY TWO
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 NO KIDDING
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 YOU KNOW I WAS IMAGINING A MARCH OF THE PENGUINS THING YOU KNOW SO I LOOKED AT MIGUEL I SAID
DanBarber_2010 MIGUEL DO THEY FLY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES TO THE FARM
DanBarber_2010 AND THEN DO THEY FLY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES BACK AT NIGHT
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 DO THEY DO THAT FOR THE CHILDREN
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 HE LOOKED AT ME LIKE I HAD JUST QUOTED A WHITNEY HOUSTON SONG
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 HE SAID NO THEY DO IT BECAUSE THE FOOD 'S BETTER
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 YOU KNOW I DIDN 'T MENTION THE SKIN OF MY BELOVED FISH
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 WHICH WAS DELICIOUS AND I DON 'T LIKE FISH SKIN I DON 'T LIKE IT SEARED I DON 'T LIKE IT CRISPY
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 IT 'S THAT ACRID TAR LIKE FLAVOR
DanBarber_2010 I ALMOST NEVER COOK WITH IT
DanBarber_2010 YET WHEN I TASTED IT AT THAT RESTAURANT IN SOUTHERN SPAIN IT TASTED NOT AT ALL LIKE FISH SKIN
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 IT TASTED SWEET AND CLEAN
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 LIKE YOU WERE TAKING A BITE OF THE OCEAN
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 I MENTIONED THAT TO MIGUEL AND HE NODDED HE SAID THE SKIN ACTS LIKE A SPONGE IT 'S THE LAST DEFENSE BEFORE ANYTHING ENTERS THE BODY IT EVOLVED
DanBarber_2010 TO SOAK UP IMPURITIES AND THEN HE ADDED
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 BUT OUR WATER HAS NO IMPURITIES
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 OKAY A FARM THAT DOESN 'T FEED ITS FISH
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 A FARM THAT MEASURES ITS SUCCESS
DanBarber_2010 BY THE SUCCESS OF ITS PREDATORS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 AND THEN I REALIZED WHEN HE SAYS
DanBarber_2010 A FARM THAT HAS NO IMPURITIES HE MADE A BIG UNDERSTATEMENT BECAUSE THE WATER THAT FLOWS THROUGH THAT FARM COMES IN FROM THE GUADALQUIVIR RIVER
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 IT 'S A RIVER THAT CARRIES WITH IT ALL THE THINGS THAT RIVERS TEND TO CARRY THESE DAYS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 CHEMICAL CONTAMINANTS PESTICIDE RUNOFF
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 AND WHEN IT WORKS ITS WAY THROUGH THE SYSTEM
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 AND LEAVES THE WATER IS CLEANER THAN WHEN IT ENTERED
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THE SYSTEM IS SO HEALTHY IT PURIFIES THE WATER
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 SO NOT JUST A FARM THAT DOESN 'T FEED ITS ANIMALS NOT JUST A FARM THAT MEASURES ITS HEALTH
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 HEALTH SUCCESS BY THE HEALTH OF ITS PREDATORS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 BUT A FARM THAT 'S LITERALLY A WATER PURIFICATION PLANT
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 AND NOT JUST FOR THOSE FISH
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 BUT FOR YOU AND ME AS WELL BECAUSE WHEN THAT WATER LEAVES IT DUMPS OUT INTO THE ATLANTIC
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 A DROP IN THE OCEAN I KNOW BUT I 'LL TAKE IT AND SO SHOULD YOU
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 BECAUSE THIS LOVE STORY
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 HOWEVER ROMANTIC IS ALSO INSTRUCTIVE
DanBarber_2010 YOU MIGHT SAY IT 'S A RECIPE FOR THE FUTURE OF GOOD FOOD
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 WHETHER WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT BASS OR BEEF CATTLE
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 WHAT WE NEED NOW IS A RADICALLY NEW CONCEPTION OF AGRICULTURE ONE IN WHICH THE FOOD ACTUALLY TASTES GOOD
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 BUT FOR A LOT PEOPLE
DanBarber_2010 THAT 'S A BIT TOO RADICAL
DanBarber_2010 WE 'RE NOT REALISTS US FOODIES
DanBarber_2010 WE 'RE LOVERS
DanBarber_2010 WE LOVE FARMERS MARKETS WE LOVE SMALL FAMILY FARMS
DanBarber_2010 WE TALK ABOUT LOCAL FOOD WE EAT ORGANIC
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 AND WHEN YOU SUGGEST THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WILL INSURE
DanBarber_2010 THE FUTURE OF GOOD FOOD SOMEONE SOMEWHERE STANDS UP AND SAYS HEY GUY
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 I LOVE PINK FLAMINGOS BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FEED THE WORLD HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FEED THE WORLD
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FEED THE WORLD CAN I BE HONEST I DON 'T LOVE THAT QUESTION
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 NO NOT BECAUSE WE ALREADY PRODUCE ENOUGH CALORIES TO MORE THAN FEED THE WORLD
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 ONE BILLION PEOPLE
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 WILL GO HUNGRY TODAY ONE BILLION THAT 'S MORE THAN EVER BEFORE
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 BECAUSE OF GROSS INEQUALITIES IN DISTRIBUTION NOT TONNAGE
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 NO I DON 'T LOVE THIS QUESTION BECAUSE IT 'S DETERMINED THE LOGIC OF OUR FOOD SYSTEM FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 FEED GRAIN TO HERBIVORES
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 PESTICIDES TO MONOCULTURES CHEMICALS TO SOIL CHICKEN TO FISH
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 AND ALL ALONG AGRIBUSINESS HAS SIMPLY ASKED
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 IF WE 'RE FEEDING MORE PEOPLE MORE CHEAPLY HOW TERRIBLE COULD THAT BE
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 THAT 'S BEEN THE MOTIVATION IT 'S BEEN THE JUSTIFICATION IT 'S BEEN THE BUSINESS PLAN
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE WE SHOULD CALL IT WHAT IT IS
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 A BUSINESS IN LIQUIDATION
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 A BUSINESS THAT 'S QUICKLY ERODING ECOLOGICAL CAPITAL THAT MAKES THAT VERY PRODUCTION POSSIBLE
DanBarber_2010 THAT 'S NOT A BUSINESS AND IT ISN 'T AGRICULTURE
DanBarber_2010 OUR BREAD BASKET IS THREATENED TODAY NOT BECAUSE OF DIMINISHING SUPPLY BUT BECAUSE OF DIMINISHING RESOURCES
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 NOT BY THE LATEST COMBINE AND TRACTOR INVENTION BUT BY FERTILE LAND
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 NOT BY PUMPS BUT BY FRESH WATER
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 NOT BY CHAINSAWS BUT BY FORESTS AND NOT BY FISHING BOATS AND NETS BUT BY FISH IN THE SEA WANT TO FEED THE WORLD
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 LET 'S START BY ASKING HOW ARE WE GOING TO FEED OURSELVES
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
DanBarber_2010 OR BETTER HOW CAN WE CREATE CONDITIONS THAT ENABLE EVERY COMMUNITY
DanBarber_2010 TO FEED ITSELF
DanBarber_2010 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
