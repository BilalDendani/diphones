PhilippePetit_2012 THERE WAS THIS WONDROUS ENDING WHEN PEOPLE AND FIRE
PhilippePetit_2012 IT WAS DREAMING TIME
PhilippePetit_2012 NOW MY STORY HAS A LOT TO DO WITH DREAMING ALTHOUGH I 'M KNOWN TO MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE
PhilippePetit_2012 FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF
PhilippePetit_2012 I SHARED WITH THE AUDIENCE A LIFETIME OF CREATIVITY HOW I PURSUE PERFECTION HOW I CHEAT THE IMPOSSIBLE AND THEN TED CHALLENGED ME PHILIPPE CAN YOU SHRINK THIS LIFETIME TO EIGHTEEN MINUTES
PhilippePetit_2012 FOR ME TO START IS TO PAY MY RESPECTS TO THE GODS OF CREATIVITY SO PLEASE JOIN ME FOR A MINUTE OF SILENCE
PhilippePetit_2012 OKAY I CHEATED IT WAS A MERE TWENTY SECONDS BUT HEY WE 'RE ON TED TIME
PhilippePetit_2012 WHEN I WAS SIX YEARS OLD I FELL IN LOVE WITH MAGIC
PhilippePetit_2012 FOR CHRISTMAS I GOT A MAGIC BOX AND A VERY OLD BOOK ON CARD MANIPULATION
PhilippePetit_2012 SOMEHOW I WAS MORE INTERESTED IN PURE MANIPULATION THAN IN ALL THE SILLY LITTLE TRICKS IN THE BOX SO I LOOKED IN THE BOOK FOR THE MOST DIFFICULT
PhilippePetit_2012 NOW I 'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU BUT I HAVE TO SHOW YOU THE CARD IS HIDDEN IN THE BACK OF THE HAND NOW THAT MANIPULATION
PhilippePetit_2012 ONE TWO
PhilippePetit_2012 TWO MONTHS LATER SIX YEARS OLD I 'M ABLE TO DO ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN AND I GO TO SEE A FAMOUS MAGICIAN AND PROUDLY ASK HIM WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK
PhilippePetit_2012 SIX YEARS OLD THE MAGICIAN LOOKED AT ME AND SAID THIS IS A DISASTER
PhilippePetit_2012 TWO YEARS LATER
PhilippePetit_2012 MAGIC JUGGLING IS MENTIONED REPEATEDLY AS A GREAT WAY TO ACQUIRE DEXTERITY AND COORDINATION
PhilippePetit_2012 NOW I HAD LONG ADMIRED HOW FAST AND FLUIDLY JUGGLERS MAKE OBJECTS FLY SO THAT 'S IT I 'M FOURTEEN I 'M BECOMING A JUGGLER
PhilippePetit_2012 I BEFRIEND A YOUNG JUGGLER IN A JUGGLING TROUPE AND HE AGREES TO SELL ME THREE CLUBS
PhilippePetit_2012 BUT IN AMERICA YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHAT ARE CLUBS NOTHING TO DO WITH GOLF THEY ARE THOSE
PhilippePetit_2012 WHEN I WAS BUYING THE CLUBS SOMEHOW THE YOUNG JUGGLER WAS HIDING FROM THE OTHERS WELL I DIDN 'T THINK MUCH OF IT AT THE TIME
PhilippePetit_2012 ANYWAY HERE I WAS PROGRESSING WITH MY NEW CLUBS BUT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
PhilippePetit_2012 I WAS PRETTY FAST
PhilippePetit_2012 BUT I WAS NOT FLUID AT ALL THE CLUBS WERE ESCAPING ME AT EACH THROW AND I WAS TRYING CONSTANTLY TO BRING THEM BACK TO ME UNTIL ONE DAY I PRACTICED IN FRONT OF FRANCIS BRUNN THE WORLD 'S GREATEST JUGGLER AND HE WAS FROWNING
PhilippePetit_2012 AND HE FINALLY ASKED CAN I SEE THOSE
PhilippePetit_2012 SO I PROUDLY SHOWED HIM MY CLUBS HE SAID PHILIPPE YOU HAVE BEEN HAD THESE ARE REJECTS THEY ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF ALIGNMENT THEY ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO JUGGLE
PhilippePetit_2012 TENACITY
PhilippePetit_2012 IS HOW I KEPT AT IT AGAINST ALL ODDS
PhilippePetit_2012 NOW I HAVE BEEN PLAYING WITH ROPES AND CLIMBING ALL MY CHILDHOOD SO THAT 'S IT I 'M SIXTEEN I 'M BECOMING A WIRE WALKER
PhilippePetit_2012 I FOUND TWO TREES
PhilippePetit_2012 BUT NOT ANY KIND OF TREES TREES WITH CHARACTER
PhilippePetit_2012 AND THE NEXT DAY ONE ROPE OFF AND A FEW DAYS LATER I WAS PRACTICING ON A SINGLE TIGHTROPE
PhilippePetit_2012 NOW YOU CAN IMAGINE AT THAT TIME I HAD TO SWITCH THE RIDICULOUS BOOTS FOR SOME SLIPPERS SO THAT IS HOW IN CASE THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WOULD LIKE TO TRY THIS IS HOW NOT TO LEARN WIRE WALKING
PhilippePetit_2012 IS A TOOL ESSENTIAL IN MY LIFE
PhilippePetit_2012 IN THE MEANTIME I AM BEING THROWN OUT OF FIVE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS BECAUSE INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO THE TEACHERS I AM MY OWN TEACHER
PhilippePetit_2012 PROGRESSING IN MY NEW ART
PhilippePetit_2012 ON THE HIGH WIRE WITHIN MONTHS I 'M ABLE TO MASTER ALL THE TRICKS THEY DO IN THE CIRCUS EXCEPT I AM NOT SATISFIED
PhilippePetit_2012 I WAS STARTING TO INVENT MY OWN MOVES AND BRING THEM TO PERFECTION
PhilippePetit_2012 BUT NOBODY WANTED TO HIRE ME
PhilippePetit_2012 SO I STARTED PUTTING A WIRE UP IN SECRET AND PERFORMING WITHOUT PERMISSION
PhilippePetit_2012 THE SYDNEY HARBOR BRIDGE
PhilippePetit_2012 TERRIFYING
PhilippePetit_2012 ALL OF A SUDDEN THE DENSITY OF THE AIR IS NO LONGER THE SAME
PhilippePetit_2012 MANHATTAN NO LONGER SPREADS ITS INFINITY
PhilippePetit_2012 THE MURMUR OF THE CITY DISSOLVES INTO A SQUALL WHOSE CHILLING POWER I NO LONGER FEEL
PhilippePetit_2012 I LIFT THE BALANCING POLE I APPROACH THE EDGE I STEP OVER THE BEAM I PUT MY LEFT FOOT ON THE CABLE
PhilippePetit_2012 THE WEIGHT OF MY BODY RAISED ON MY RIGHT LEG ANCHORED TO THE FLANK OF THE BUILDING
PhilippePetit_2012 SHALL I EVER SO SLIGHTLY SHIFT MY WEIGHT TO THE LEFT MY RIGHT LEG WILL BE UNBURDENED MY RIGHT FOOT WILL FREELY MEET THE WIRE
PhilippePetit_2012 ON ONE SIDE A MASS OF A MOUNTAIN A LIFE I KNOW
PhilippePetit_2012 ON THE OTHER THE UNIVERSE OF THE CLOUDS SO FULL OF UNKNOWN WE THINK IT 'S EMPTY
PhilippePetit_2012 WHICH VIBRATES WHICH ROLLS ON ITSELF WHICH IS ICE
PhilippePetit_2012 WHICH IS THREE TONS TIGHT READY TO EXPLODE
PhilippePetit_2012 BUT IT IS TOO LATE
PhilippePetit_2012 DECISIVELY MY OTHER FOOT SETS ITSELF ONTO THE CABLE
PhilippePetit_2012 IN MY DICTIONARY
PhilippePetit_2012 SO AFTER THE WALK PEOPLE ASK ME HOW CAN YOU TOP THAT WELL I DIDN 'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM I WAS NOT INTERESTED IN COLLECTING THE GIGANTIC IN BREAKING RECORDS IN FACT
PhilippePetit_2012 SUCH AS MY STREET JUGGLING FOR EXAMPLE
PhilippePetit_2012 SO EACH TIME
PhilippePetit_2012 I DRAW MY CIRCLE OF CHALK ON THE PAVEMENT AND ENTER
PhilippePetit_2012 AS THE IMPROVISING COMIC SILENT CHARACTER I CREATED FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO I AM AS HAPPY AS WHEN I AM IN THE CLOUDS
PhilippePetit_2012 THANK YOU THANK YOU
PhilippePetit_2012 EACH TIME I STREET JUGGLE
PhilippePetit_2012 NOW IMPROVISATION IS EMPOWERING BECAUSE
PhilippePetit_2012 IT WELCOMES THE UNKNOWN
PhilippePetit_2012 AND
PhilippePetit_2012 SINCE WHAT 'S IMPOSSIBLE IS ALWAYS UNKNOWN
PhilippePetit_2012 IT ALLOWS ME
PhilippePetit_2012 TO BELIEVE I CAN CHEAT THE IMPOSSIBLE
PhilippePetit_2012 NOW I HAVE DONE THE IMPOSSIBLE NOT ONCE BUT MANY TIMES SO WHAT SHOULD I SHARE OH I KNOW ISRAEL SOME YEARS AGO
PhilippePetit_2012 I WAS INVITED TO OPEN THE ISRAEL FESTIVAL BY A HIGH WIRE WALK AND I CHOSE TO PUT MY WIRE BETWEEN THE ARAB QUARTERS AND THE JEWISH QUARTER OF JERUSALEM OVER THE BEN HINNOM VALLEY AND I THOUGHT
PhilippePetit_2012 IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLE IF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WIRE I STOPPED AND LIKE A MAGICIAN I PRODUCE A DOVE AND SEND HER IN THE SKY AS A LIVING SYMBOL OF PEACE WELL NOW I MUST SAY IT WAS A LITTLE BIT HARD TO FIND A DOVE IN ISRAEL BUT I GOT ONE
PhilippePetit_2012 NOW BUT HOLD ON I 'M NOT FINISHED SO NOW I 'M LIKE FIFTY YARDS FROM MY ARRIVAL AND I 'M EXHAUSTED SO MY STEPS ARE SLOW AND SOMETHING HAPPENED
PhilippePetit_2012 FOR A MOMENT THE ENTIRE CROWD HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR DIFFERENCES THEY HAD BECOME ONE
PhilippePetit_2012 PUSHING ME TO TRIUMPH
PhilippePetit_2012 PLEASE TAKE THIS MUSIC WITH YOU HOME AND START
PhilippePetit_2012 GLUING FEATHERS TO YOUR ARMS AND TAKE OFF AND FLY AND LOOK AT THE WORLD
PhilippePetit_2012 FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
PhilippePetit_2012 AND WHEN YOU SEE MOUNTAINS REMEMBER MOUNTAINS CAN BE MOVED
