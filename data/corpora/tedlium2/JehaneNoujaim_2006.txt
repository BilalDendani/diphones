JehaneNoujaim_2006 WISH TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE A LITTLE KID AND YOU ALL YOUR FRIENDS ASK YOU IF A GENIE COULD ASK GIVE YOU ONE WISH IN THE WORLD WHAT WOULD IT BE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AND I ALWAYS ANSWERED WELL I'D WANT THE WISH TO KNOW HAVE THE WISDOM TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO WISH FOR WELL THEN YOU'D BE SCREWED BECAUSE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 YOU'D KNOW WHAT TO WISH FOR AND YOU'D USE UP YOUR WISH AND NOW SINCE WE ONLY HAVE ONE WISH UNLIKE LAST YEAR THEY HAD THREE WISHES I'M NOT GOING TO WISH FOR THAT SO
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THE TED PRIZE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 WORLD PEACE IS FOR PEOPLE TO MEET EACH OTHER I'VE MET A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS AND I'VE FILMED SOME OF THEM FROM A DOT COM EXECUTIVE IN
JehaneNoujaim_2006 SO BASICALLY
JehaneNoujaim_2006 WHAT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO TRAVEL TO MEET PEOPLE IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN
JehaneNoujaim_2006 BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TRAVEL ALL OVER THE WORLD AT THE SAME TIME AND A LONG TIME AGO WELL ABOUT FORTY YEARS AGO
JehaneNoujaim_2006 MY MOM HAD AN EXCHANGE STUDENT AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SLIDES OF THE EXCHANGE STUDENT THIS IS DONNA THIS IS DONNA AT THE STATUE OF LIBERTY
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THIS IS MY MOTHER AND AUNT TEACHING DONNA HOW TO RIDE A BIKE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THIS IS DONNA EATING ICE CREAM
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AND THIS IS DONNA TEACHING MY AUNT HOW TO DO A FILIPINO DANCE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 NOW I REALLY THINK AS THE WORLD IS GETTING SMALLER IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE LEARN EACH OTHER 'S DANCE MOVES THAT WE MEET EACH OTHER WE GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER
JehaneNoujaim_2006 WE ARE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CROSS BORDERS TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER TO UNDERSTAND PEOPLE 'S HOPES AND DREAMS WHAT MAKES THEM LAUGH AND CRY AND I KNOW THAT WE CAN'T ALL
JehaneNoujaim_2006 DO EXCHANGE PROGRAMS AND I CAN'T FORCE EVERYBODY TO TRAVEL I'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THAT TO CHRIS AND AMY AND THEY SAID THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THIS YOU CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE OF FREE WILL AND I TOTALLY
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THAT SO WE'RE NOT FORCING PEOPLE TO TRAVEL BUT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT ANOTHER WAY TO TRAVEL THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE A SHIP
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AN AIRPLANE AND JUST REQUIRES A MOVIE CAMERA A PROJECTOR AND A SCREEN AND
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY I WAS ASKED THAT I SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHERE I PERSONALLY COME FROM AND CAMERON I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU MANAGED TO GET OUT OF THAT ONE BUT
JehaneNoujaim_2006 I THINK THAT BUILDING BRIDGES IS IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE OF WHERE I COME FROM I'M THE DAUGHTER OF AN AMERICAN MOTHER AND
JehaneNoujaim_2006 WITH A PERSIAN NAME THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE CRISIS SO MAYBE ME STARTING TO TAKE PICTURES WAS SOME KIND OF WAY
JehaneNoujaim_2006 BRING BOTH SIDES OF MY FAMILY TOGETHER A WAY TO TAKE THE WORLDS WITH ME A WAY TO TELL STORIES VISUALLY
JehaneNoujaim_2006 IT ALL KIND OF STARTED THAT WAY BUT I THINK THAT I REALLY REALIZED THE POWER OF THE IMAGE WHEN I FIRST WENT TO THE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 CENTER THERE WHERE THEY WERE TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO READ AND WRITE AND GET VACCINATIONS AGAINST THE MANY DISEASES YOU CAN GET FROM SORTING THROUGH GARBAGE AND I BEGAN TO START TEACHING THERE I TAUGHT ENGLISH AND I MET SOME INCREDIBLE WOMEN THERE I MET
JehaneNoujaim_2006 PEOPLE THAT LIVE SEVEN PEOPLE TO A ROOM BARELY CAN AFFORD THEIR EVENING MEAL YET
JehaneNoujaim_2006 WITH THIS STRENGTH OF SPIRIT AND SENSE OF HUMOR AND JUST INCREDIBLE QUALITIES I GOT DRAWN INTO THIS COMMUNITY AND I BEGAN TO TAKE PICTURES THERE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 I TOOK PICTURES OF WEDDINGS AND OLDER FAMILY MEMBERS THINGS THAT THEY WANTED MEMORIES OF
JehaneNoujaim_2006 ABOUT TWO YEARS AFTER I STARTED TAKING THESE PICTURES THE CAIRO CONFERENCE ON UN CONFERENCE ON POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT ASKED ME TO SHOW THEM
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AT THE CONFERENCE SO I WAS EIGHTEEN I WAS VERY EXCITED IT WAS MY FIRST EXHIBIT OF PHOTOGRAPHS AND THEY WERE ALL PUT UP THERE AND AFTER ABOUT
JehaneNoujaim_2006 TWO DAYS THEY ALL CAME DOWN EXCEPT FOR THREE PEOPLE WERE VERY UPSET VERY ANGRY THAT I WAS SHOWING THESE DIRTY SIDES OF CAIRO AND WHY DIDN'T I CUT THE DEAD DONKEY OUT OF THE FRAME
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AND AS I SAT THERE I GOT VERY DEPRESSED I LOOKED AT THIS BIG EMPTY WALL WITH YOU KNOW THREE LONELY PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WERE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 YOU KNOW VERY PRETTY PHOTOGRAPHS AND I WAS LIKE I FAILED AT THIS BUT I WAS LOOKING AT THIS
JehaneNoujaim_2006 INTENSE EMOTION AND INTENSE FEELING THAT HAD COME OUT OF PEOPLE JUST SEEING THESE PHOTOGRAPHS I MEAN HERE I WAS THIS EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD PIPSQUEAK THAT NOBODY LISTENED TO AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I PUT THESE PHOTOGRAPHS ON THE WALL AND THERE WERE ARGUMENTS AND THEY HAD TO BE TAKEN DOWN AND
JehaneNoujaim_2006 I JUST SAW THE POWER OF THE IMAGE AND IT WAS INCREDIBLE AND I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT REACTION THAT I SAW THERE WAS ACTUALLY PEOPLE THAT WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO THE GARBAGE VILLAGE THEMSELVES THAT WOULD NEVER
JehaneNoujaim_2006 HAVE SEEN THAT THE HUMAN SPIRIT COULD THRIVE IN SUCH DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND I THINK IT WAS AT THAT POINT THAT I DECIDED THAT
JehaneNoujaim_2006 I WANTED TO USE PHOTOGRAPHY AND FILM TO SOMEHOW BRIDGE GAPS TO BRIDGE CULTURES BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER CROSS BORDERS
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AND SO THAT'S WHAT REALLY KIND OF STARTED ME OFF DID A STINT AT MTV MADE A FILM CALLED STARTUP COM
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AND THEN IN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF MUSIC FILMS BUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE WHEN THE WAR IN IRAQ WAS ABOUT TO START I FELT
JehaneNoujaim_2006 IT WAS A VERY SURREAL
JehaneNoujaim_2006 FEELING FOR ME BECAUSE BEFORE THE WAR STARTED THERE WAS KIND OF THIS MEDIA WAR THAT WAS GOING ON AND I WAS WATCHING TELEVISION IN NEW YORK AND THERE SEEMED TO BE JUST ONE POINT OF VIEW THAT WAS COMING ACROSS AND IT WENT FROM
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THE COVERAGE WENT FROM THE U S STATE DEPARTMENT TO EMBEDDED TROOPS AND WHAT PEOPLE WERE WHAT WAS COMING ACROSS ON THE NEWS WAS THAT
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AND I KNEW THAT THERE WAS A COMPLETELY OTHER STORY THAT WAS TAKING PLACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WHERE MY PARENTS WERE I KNEW THAT
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THERE WAS A COMPLETELY OTHER STORY BEING TOLD AND I WAS THINKING HOW ARE PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER WHEN THEY'RE GETTING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MESSAGES AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE OTHER 'S BEING TOLD
JehaneNoujaim_2006 HOW ARE PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO HAVE ANY KIND OF COMMON UNDERSTANDING OR KNOW HOW TO MOVE TOGETHER INTO THE FUTURE SO I KNEW THAT I HAD TO GO THERE I JUST WANTED TO BE IN THE CENTER I HAD NO PLAN I HAD NO FUNDING
JehaneNoujaim_2006 I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A CAMERA AT THE TIME I HAD SOMEBODY BRING IT THERE BECAUSE I WANTED TO GET ACCESS TO AL JAZEERA GEORGE BUSH 'S FAVORITE CHANNEL
JehaneNoujaim_2006 A PLACE WHICH I WAS VERY CURIOUS ABOUT BECAUSE IT'S
JehaneNoujaim_2006 DISLIKED BY MANY GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE ARAB WORLD AND ALSO CALLED THE MOUTHPIECE OF OSAMA BIN LADEN BY SOME PEOPLE IN THE U S GOVERNMENT SO I WAS THINKING YOU KNOW
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THIS STATION THAT'S HATED BY SO MANY PEOPLE HAS TO BE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT I'VE GOT TO GO SEE WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AND I ALSO WANTED TO GO SEE CENTRAL COMMAND WHICH WAS TEN MINUTES AWAY AND THAT WAY I COULD GET ACCESS TO HOW THIS NEWS WAS BEING CREATED
JehaneNoujaim_2006 ON THE ARAB SIDE REACHING THE ARAB WORLD AND ON THE U S AND WESTERN SIDE REACHING THE U S AND WHEN I WENT THERE AND SAT THERE AND MET THESE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE CENTER OF IT AND
JehaneNoujaim_2006 SAT WITH THESE CHARACTERS I MET SOME SURPRISING VERY COMPLEX PEOPLE AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT OF
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THAT EXPERIENCE OF WHEN YOU SIT WITH SOMEBODY AND YOU FILM THEM AND YOU LISTEN TO THEM AND YOU ALLOW THEM MORE THAN A FIVE SECOND SOUND BITE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THE AMAZING COMPLEXITY OF PEOPLE EMERGE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AND
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THAT
JehaneNoujaim_2006 MAYBE I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO IT BUT
JehaneNoujaim_2006 HAVE PLANS FOR
JehaneNoujaim_2006 WHEN THEY FINISH THEIR HIGH SCHOOL I WILL SEND THEM TO AMERICA TO STUDY THERE I WILL PAY FOR THEIR STUDY
JehaneNoujaim_2006 A FLOOR A COLD TILE FLOOR AND IT WAS
JehaneNoujaim_2006 IT WAS ABSOLUTELY REVOLTING IT MADE ME SICK TO MY STOMACH AND THEN WHAT HIT ME WAS THE NIGHT BEFORE THERE HAD BEEN SOME KIND OF BOMBING
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AL JAZEERA HAD SHOWN
JehaneNoujaim_2006 IMAGES OF THE PEOPLE AND THEY WERE EQUALLY IF NOT MORE HORRIFYING THAN THE IMAGES WERE AND I REMEMBER HAVING SEEN IT IN THE AL JAZEERA OFFICE AND THOUGHT TO MYSELF
JehaneNoujaim_2006 GROSS THAT'S BAD AND THEN GOING AWAY AND PROBABLY EATING DINNER OR SOMETHING AND IT DIDN'T AFFECT ME AS MUCH SO
JehaneNoujaim_2006 IMPACT IT HAD ON ME ME REALIZING THAT I JUST SAW PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THOSE PEOPLE IN THE AL JAZEERA OFFICE MUST HAVE FELT THE WAY I WAS FEELING THAT NIGHT
JehaneNoujaim_2006 IT UPSET ME ON A PROFOUND LEVEL THAT I WASN'T BOTHERED AS MUCH THE NIGHT BEFORE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 IT MAKES ME HATE WAR
JehaneNoujaim_2006 DOESN'T MAKE ME BELIEVE THAT WE'RE IN WORLD THAT CAN LIVE WITHOUT WAR YET
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AND WHEN WE SHOWED THE FILM IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND THE ARAB WORLD
JehaneNoujaim_2006 WE HAD SUCH INCREDIBLE REACTIONS IT WAS AMAZING TO SEE HOW PEOPLE WERE MOVED BY THIS FILM IN THE ARAB WORLD AND IT'S NOT REALLY BY THE FILM IT'S BY THE CHARACTERS I MEAN JOSH RUSHING WAS THIS
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AND SAMEER YOU KNOW ON THE OTHER HAND WAS ALSO QUITE AN INTERESTING CHARACTER FOR THE ARAB WORLD TO SEE BECAUSE IT BROUGHT OUT THE COMPLEXITIES OF THIS LOVE HATE RELATIONSHIP THAT THE ARAB WORLD HAS WITH THE WEST
JehaneNoujaim_2006 IN THE UNITED STATES I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THE MOTIVATIONS THE POSITIVE MOTIVATIONS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN
JehaneNoujaim_2006 SEE THIS FILM YOU KNOW WE'RE CRITICIZED ABROAD FOR FEELING LIKE WE'RE BELIEVING WE'RE THE SAVIORS OF THE WORLD IN SOME WAY BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF IT IS THAT
JehaneNoujaim_2006 POWER THAT WE NEED TO WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO GET THE POWER TO CHANGE THINGS AND I SAW THIS WITH AUDIENCES THIS WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AFTER THE SCREENING AND SAID
JehaneNoujaim_2006 YOU KNOW I KNOW THIS IS CRAZY I SAW THE BOMBS BEING LOADED ON THE PLANES I SAW THE MILITARY GOING OUT TO WAR BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND PEOPLE 'S ANGER TOWARDS US UNTIL YOU SEE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THE PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITALS AND THE VICTIMS OF THE WAR AND HOW DO WE GET OUT OF THIS BUBBLE HOW DO WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OTHER PERSON
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THINKING NOW I DON'T KNOW WHETHER A FILM CAN CHANGE THE WORLD BUT I KNOW THAT IT STARTS I KNOW THE POWER THAT I KNOW THAT IT STARTS PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO CHANGE THE WORLD
JehaneNoujaim_2006 NOW I'M NOT A PHILOSOPHER SO I FEEL LIKE I SHOULDN 'T GO INTO GREAT DEPTH ON THIS BUT SHOW YOU LET FILM SPEAK FOR ITSELF AND TAKE YOU TO THIS OTHER WORLD BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT FILM HAS THE ABILITY TO TAKE YOU ACROSS BORDERS I'D LIKE YOU TO JUST SIT BACK
JehaneNoujaim_2006 ONE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 A
JehaneNoujaim_2006 ON
JehaneNoujaim_2006 ON
JehaneNoujaim_2006 ABOUT
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THEM AND
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 SONG IS SOMETHING THAT WE COMMUNICATED WITH PEOPLE WHO OTHERWISE WOULD NOT
JehaneNoujaim_2006 HAVE UNDERSTOOD WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM YOU COULD GIVE THEM A LONG POLITICAL SPEECH THEY WOULD STILL NOT UNDERSTAND
JehaneNoujaim_2006 TELL YOU WHEN YOU FINISH THAT SONG PEOPLE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THINK EVERYBODY 'S HAD THAT FEELING OF SITTING IN A THEATER IN A DARK ROOM WITH OTHER STRANGERS WATCHING A VERY POWERFUL FILM AND THEY FELT THAT FEELING OF TRANSFORMATION
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AND WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS WHAT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IS HOW CAN WE USE THAT FEELING TO ACTUALLY CREATE A MOVEMENT THROUGH FILM
JehaneNoujaim_2006 BEEN LISTENING TO THE TALKS IN SOME OF THE CONFERENCE AND ROBERT WRIGHT SAID YESTERDAY THAT IF WE HAVE AN APPRECIATION FOR ANOTHER PERSON 'S HUMANITY
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THEN THEY WILL HAVE AN APPRECIATION FOR OURS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT CONNECTING PEOPLE THROUGH FILM GETTING THESE INDEPENDENT VOICES OUT THERE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 NOW JOSH RUSHING ACTUALLY ENDED UP LEAVING THE MILITARY AND TAKING A JOB WITH AL JAZEERA SO HIS
JehaneNoujaim_2006 FEELING IS THAT HE 'S ON AL JAZEERA INTERNATIONAL BECAUSE HE FEELS LIKE HE CAN ACTUALLY USE MEDIA TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN EAST AND WEST
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AND THAT'S AN AMAZING THING BUT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WAYS TO GIVE POWER TO THESE INDEPENDENT VOICES TO GIVE POWER TO THE FILMMAKERS TO GIVE POWER TO PEOPLE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 WHO ARE TRYING TO USE FILM FOR CHANGE AND THERE ARE INCREDIBLE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE DOING THIS ALREADY THERE'S WITNESS THAT YOU HEARD FROM EARLIER
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THERE'S JUST VISION THAT ARE WORKING WITH PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS WHO ARE WORKING TOGETHER FOR PEACE AND DOCUMENTING THAT PROCESS AND GETTING INTERVIEWS OUT THERE AND USING THIS FILM TO TAKE TO CONGRESS TO SHOW THAT
JehaneNoujaim_2006 IT'S A POWERFUL TOOL TO SHOW THAT THIS IS A WOMAN WHO 'S HAD HER DAUGHTER KILLED IN AN ATTACK AND SHE BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE PEACEFUL WAYS TO SOLVE THIS THERE'S
JehaneNoujaim_2006 IT'S AMAZING I WATCHED IT AND I'M JUST I'M BLOWN AWAY BY IT AND ITS POTENTIAL TO BRING VOICES FROM AROUND THE WORLD INDEPENDENT VOICES FROM AROUND THE WORLD AND CREATE A TRULY DEMOCRATIC GLOBAL TELEVISION
JehaneNoujaim_2006 SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO CREATE A PLATFORM FOR THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO CREATE SOME MOMENTUM TO GET EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD INVOLVED IN THIS MOVEMENT
JehaneNoujaim_2006 I'D LIKE FOR US TO IMAGINE FOR A SECOND
JehaneNoujaim_2006 IMAGINE A DAY
JehaneNoujaim_2006 WHEN YOU HAVE EVERYONE COMING TOGETHER FROM AROUND THE WORLD
JehaneNoujaim_2006 YOU HAVE TOWNS AND VILLAGES AND THEATERS
JehaneNoujaim_2006 ALL FROM AROUND THE WORLD GETTING TOGETHER AND SITTING IN THE DARK AND SHARING A COMMUNAL EXPERIENCE OF WATCHING A FILM OR A COUPLE OF FILMS TOGETHER
JehaneNoujaim_2006 WATCHING A FILM WHICH MAYBE HIGHLIGHTS A CHARACTER THAT IS FIGHTING TO LIVE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 OR JUST A CHARACTER THAT DEFIES STEREOTYPES MAKES A JOKE SINGS A SONG COMEDIES DOCUMENTARIES SHORTS THIS AMAZING POWER CAN BE USED TO CHANGE PEOPLE AND TO BOND PEOPLE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 TO CROSS BORDERS AND HAVE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE HAVING A COMMUNAL EXPERIENCE SO IF YOU IMAGINE THIS DAY WHEN ALL AROUND THE WORLD YOU HAVE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THEATERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD AND PLACES WHERE WE PROJECT FILMS IF YOU IMAGINE FROM PROJECTING FROM TIMES SQUARE TO TAHIR SQUARE IN CAIRO
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THE SAME FILM IN RAMALLAH THE SAME FILM IN JERUSALEM YOU KNOW WE COULD EVEN USE WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO A FRIEND OF MINE ABOUT USING THE SIDE OF THE GREAT PYRAMID AND THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA
JehaneNoujaim_2006 IT'S ENDLESS WHAT YOU CAN IMAGINE IN TERMS OF WHERE YOU CAN PROJECT FILMS AND WHERE YOU CAN HAVE THIS COMMUNAL EXPERIENCE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS ONE DAY IF WE CAN CREATE IT THIS ONE DAY CAN CREATE MOMENTUM FOR ALL OF THESE INDEPENDENT VOICES
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THERE ISN'T A PLACE THERE ISN'T AN ORGANIZATION WHICH IS CONNECTING THE INDEPENDENT VOICES OF THE WORLD TO GET OUT THERE AND YET I'M HEARING THROUGHOUT THIS CONFERENCE THAT THE BIGGEST DANGER IN OUR FUTURE IS UNDERSTANDING THE OTHER AND HAVING
JehaneNoujaim_2006 THIS COULD BE AN INCREDIBLE DAY SO WE'VE ALREADY MADE A PARTNERSHIP ACTUALLY SET UP THROUGH A TED SOMEBODY FROM THE TED COMMUNITY
JehaneNoujaim_2006 JOHN CAMEN INTRODUCED ME TO STEVEN APKON FROM THE JACOB BURNS FILM CENTER AND WE STARTED CALLING UP EVERYBODY AND IN THE LAST WEEK THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE RESPONDED TO US FROM
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AS CLOSE AS PALO ALTO TO MONGOLIA AND TO INDIA THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS GLOBAL DAY OF FILM
JehaneNoujaim_2006 TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A PLATFORM FOR INDEPENDENT VOICES AND INDEPENDENT FILMS TO GET OUT THERE
JehaneNoujaim_2006 NOW WE'VE THOUGHT ABOUT A NAME FOR THIS DAY
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU NOW THE MOST AMAZING PART OF THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS BEEN SHARING IDEAS AND WISHES AND
JehaneNoujaim_2006 SO I INVITE YOU TO GIVE BRAINSTORMS ONTO HOW DO THE HOW DOES THIS DAY ECHO INTO THE FUTURE HOW DO WE USE TECHNOLOGY
JehaneNoujaim_2006 TO MAKE THIS DAY ECHO INTO THE FUTURE SO THAT WE CAN BUILD COMMUNITY AND HAVE THESE COMMUNITIES WORKING TOGETHER THROUGH THE INTERNET
JehaneNoujaim_2006 SO WHAT WE'D LIKE TO CALL THIS DAY OF FILM IS PANGEA CINEMA DAY AND IF YOU JUST
JehaneNoujaim_2006 ALL OF THESE PEOPLE IN THESE TOWNS WOULD BE WATCHING THEN I THINK THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY REALLY MAKE A MOVEMENT
JehaneNoujaim_2006 HEART AND SOUL ALL ACROSS THE WORLD IS BY SHOWING THEM A FILM AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE INDEPENDENT FILMMAKERS AND FILMS OUT THERE THAT CAN REALLY MAKE THIS HAPPEN
JehaneNoujaim_2006 AND THAT'S MY WISH SO I GUESS I'M SUPPOSED TO GIVE YOU MY
JehaneNoujaim_2006 ONE SENTENCE WISH BUT WE'RE WAY OUT OF TIME
