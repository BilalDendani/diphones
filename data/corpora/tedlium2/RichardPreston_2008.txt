RichardPreston_2008 HAS RAINFORESTS TEMPERATE RAINFORESTS WHERE IT CAN RAIN MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED INCHES A YEAR
RichardPreston_2008 THIS IS THE REALM OF THE COAST REDWOOD TREE ITS SPECIES NAME IS SEQUOIA SEMPERVIRENS
RichardPreston_2008 IS THE TALLEST LIVING ORGANISM ON EARTH
RichardPreston_2008 THE RANGE OF THE SPECIES GOES UP TO AS MUCH AS THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FEET TALL THAT'S THIRTY EIGHT STORIES TALL THESE ARE TREES THAT WOULD STAND OUT IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN
RichardPreston_2008 NOBODY KNOWS HOW OLD THE OLDEST LIVING COAST REDWOODS ARE BECAUSE NOBODY HAS EVER DRILLED INTO ANY OF THEM TO COUNT THEIR ANNUAL GROWTH RINGS AND IN ANY CASE THE CENTERS OF THE OLDEST INDIVIDUALS APPEAR TO BE HOLLOW
RichardPreston_2008 BUT IT'S BELIEVED THAT THE OLDEST LIVING REDWOODS ARE PERHAPS TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD ROUGHLY THE AGE OF THE PARTHENON
RichardPreston_2008 ALTHOUGH IT'S ALSO SUSPECTED THAT THERE MAY BE INDIVIDUAL TREES THAT ARE OLDER THAN THAT
RichardPreston_2008 YOU CAN SEE THE RANGE OF THE COAST REDWOODS IT'S HERE IN RED THE LARGEST INDIVIDUALS OF THIS SPECIES THE DREADNOUGHTS OF THEIR KIND LIVE JUST ON THE NORTH COAST OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THE RAIN IS REALLY
RichardPreston_2008 IN RECENT HISTORIC TIMES ABOUT NINETY SIX PERCENT
RichardPreston_2008 OF THE COAST REDWOOD FOREST WAS CUT DOWN ESPECIALLY IN A SERIES OF BURSTS OF INTENSE LIQUIDATION LOGGING CLEAR CUTTING THAT TOOK PLACE
RichardPreston_2008 ENTIRELY PROTECTED IN A CHAIN OF SMALL PARKS STRUNG OUT LIKE PEARLS ALONG THE NORTH COAST OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING REDWOOD NATIONAL PARK
RichardPreston_2008 BUT CURIOUSLY REDWOOD RAINFORESTS THE FRAGMENTS THAT WE HAVE LEFT TO THIS DAY REMAIN UNDER EXPLORED REDWOOD RAINFOREST IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO MOVE THROUGH
RichardPreston_2008 AND EVEN TODAY INDIVIDUAL TREES ARE BEING DISCOVERED THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE INCLUDING IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND AND SIX HYPERION THE WORLD 'S TALLEST TREE
RichardPreston_2008 DO A LITTLE GEDANKEN EXPERIMENT I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO IMAGINE WHAT A REDWOOD REALLY IS AS A LIVING ORGANISM AND CHRIS IF I COULD HAVE YOU UP HERE
RichardPreston_2008 I HAVE A TAPE MEASURE
RichardPreston_2008 IT'S A KIND LOANER FROM TED
RichardPreston_2008 AND CHRIS IF YOU COULD TAKE THE END OF THAT TAPE MEASURE
RichardPreston_2008 ISN'T LONG ENOUGH IT'S ONLY A TWENTY FIVE FOOT TAPE CHRIS COULD YOU EXTEND YOUR ARM OUT THAT WAY
RichardPreston_2008 THERE WE GO OK
RichardPreston_2008 MAYBE ABOUT HERE ABOUT THIRTY FEET
RichardPreston_2008 IS THE DIAMETER OF A BIG REDWOOD
RichardPreston_2008 NOW LET YOUR IMAGINATION GO UPWARD INTO SPACE THINK ABOUT THIS TREE
RichardPreston_2008 RISING UPWARD INTO REDWOOD SPACE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET
RichardPreston_2008 THIRTY TWO STORIES AN INDIVIDUAL LIVING ORGANISM ARTICULATING ITS FORMS UPWARD INTO SPACE OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME
RichardPreston_2008 THE REDWOOD SPECIES SEEMS TO EXIST IN ANOTHER KIND OF TIME NOT HUMAN TIME BUT WHAT WE MIGHT CALL REDWOOD TIME REDWOOD TIME MOVES AT A MORE STATELY PACE THAN HUMAN TIME
RichardPreston_2008 TO US WHEN WE LOOK AT A REDWOOD TREE IT SEEMS TO BE MOTIONLESS AND STILL AND YET REDWOODS ARE CONSTANTLY IN MOTION
RichardPreston_2008 MOVING UPWARD INTO SPACE
RichardPreston_2008 TIME OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS PLANT THIS SMALL SEED WAIT TWO THOUSAND YEARS AND YOU GET THIS THE LOST MONARCH
RichardPreston_2008 YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE ORGANISM YOU'RE LIKE A MOUSE LOOKING AT THE FOOT OF AN ELEPHANT AND MOST OF THE ORGANISM IS OVERHEAD UNSEEN
RichardPreston_2008 I BECAME VERY INTERESTED AND I WROTE ABOUT A COUPLE STEVE SILLETT AND MARIE ANTOINE ARE THE PRINCIPAL EXPLORERS OF THE REDWOOD FOREST CANOPY THEY'RE WORLD CLASS ATHLETES AND THEY ALSO ARE WORLD CLASS
RichardPreston_2008 STEVE SILLETT WHEN HE WAS A NINETEEN YEAR OLD COLLEGE STUDENT AT REED COLLEGE HAD HEARD THAT THE REDWOOD FOREST CANOPY IS CONSIDERED TO BE A SO CALLED REDWOOD DESERT
RichardPreston_2008 THAT IS TO SAY AT THAT TIME IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING UP THERE EXCEPT THE BRANCHES OF REDWOOD TREES
RichardPreston_2008 AND WITH A FRIEND OF HIS HE TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO FREE CLIMB A REDWOOD WITHOUT ROPES OR ANY EQUIPMENT TO SEE WHAT WAS UP THERE HE CLIMBED UP A SMALL TREE NEXT TO THIS GIANT REDWOOD AND THEN
RichardPreston_2008 HE LEAPED THROUGH SPACE AND GRABBED A BRANCH WITH HIS HANDS AND ENDED UP HANGING LIKE CATCHING A BAR OF A TRAPEZE AND THEN FROM THERE HE CLIMBED DIRECTLY UP THE BARK
RichardPreston_2008 THAT THERE WAS A YELLOW JACKET WASP 'S NEST THE SIZE OF A BOWLING BALL HANGING FROM THE BRANCH THAT STEVE HAD JUMPED INTO AND WHEN MARWOOD MADE THE JUMP HE WAS COVERED WITH WASPS STINGING HIM IN THE FACE AND EYES HE NEARLY LET GO
RichardPreston_2008 HE WOULD HAVE FALLEN TO HIS DEATH BEING SEVENTY FIVE FEET ABOVE THE GROUND BUT THEY MADE IT TO THE TOP AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS NOT A REDWOOD DESERT BUT A LOST WORLD
RichardPreston_2008 A KIND OF THREE DIMENSIONAL LABYRINTH IN THE AIR FILLED WITH UNKNOWN LIFE NOW I HAD BEEN WORKING ON OTHER TOPICS THE EMERGENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
RichardPreston_2008 WHICH COME OUT OF THE NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS OF THE EARTH MAKE A TRANS SPECIES JUMP AND GET INTO HUMANS
RichardPreston_2008 AFTER THREE BOOKS ON THIS IT GOT TO BE A BIT MUCH IN A WAY
RichardPreston_2008 MY WIFE AND I ADORE OUR CHILDREN
RichardPreston_2008 AND I BEGAN CLIMBING TREES WITH MY KIDS AS JUST SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEM USING THE SO CALLED ARBORIST CLIMBING TECHNIQUE
RichardPreston_2008 ROPES YOU USE ROPES TO GET YOURSELF UP INTO THE CROWN OF A TREE CHILDREN ARE INCREDIBLY ADEPT AT CLIMBING TREES THAT'S MY SON OLIVER
RichardPreston_2008 THEY DON'T SEEM TO SUFFER FROM THE SAME FEAR OF HEIGHTS THAT HUMANS DO
RichardPreston_2008 IF ONTOGENY RECAPITULATES PHYLOGENY THEN CHILDREN ARE SOMEWHAT CLOSER TO OUR ROOTS AS PRIMATES IN THE ARBOREAL FOREST
RichardPreston_2008 HUMANS APPEAR TO BE THE ONLY PRIMATES THAT I KNOW OF THAT ARE AFRAID OF HEIGHTS ALL OTHER PRIMATES WHEN THEY'RE SCARED THEY RUN UP A TREE WHERE THEY FEEL SAFE
RichardPreston_2008 WE CAMPED OVERNIGHT IN THE TREES
RichardPreston_2008 IN TREE BOATS THIS IS MY DAUGHTER LAURA THEN FIFTEEN LOOKING OUT OF A TREE BOAT SHE 'S BY THE WAY TIED IN WITH A ROPE SO SHE CAN'T FALL
RichardPreston_2008 LOOKING OUT OF A TREE BOAT IN THE MORNING AND HEARING BIRDSONG COMING IN THREE DIMENSIONS AROUND US WE HAD BEEN VISITED IN THE NIGHT BY FLYING SQUIRRELS WHO
RichardPreston_2008 SEEM TO RECOGNIZE HUMANS FOR WHAT THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER SEEN THEM IN THE CANOPY BEFORE AND WE PRACTICED ADVANCED TECHNIQUES LIKE SKY WALKING WHERE YOU CAN MOVE FROM TREE TO TREE THROUGH SPACE RATHER LIKE SPIDERMAN
RichardPreston_2008 IT BECAME A WRITING PROJECT WHEN STEVE SILLETT GETS UP INTO A BIG REDWOOD HE FIRES AN ARROW WHICH TRAILS A FISHING LINE WHICH GETS OVER A BRANCH IN THE TREE AND THEN YOU ASCEND UP A ROPE WHICH HAS BEEN DRAGGED INTO THE TREE BY THE LINE
RichardPreston_2008 YOU ASCEND THIRTY STORIES THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE CLIMBING THIS TREE GAYA WHICH IS THOUGHT TO BE ONE OF THE OLDEST REDWOODS THERE THEY ARE THEY ARE ONLY ONE SEVENTH OF THE WAY UP THAT TREE
RichardPreston_2008 YOU DO FEEL A SENSE OF EXPOSURE THERE IS A SMALL PERSON RIGHT DOWN THERE ON THE GROUND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE CLIMBING A WALL OF WOOD BUT THEN
RichardPreston_2008 YOU ENTER THE REDWOOD CANOPY AND IT'S LIKE COMING THROUGH A LAYER OF CLOUDS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU LOSE SIGHT OF THE GROUND AND YOU ALSO LOSE SIGHT OF THE SKY
RichardPreston_2008 AND YOU'RE IN A THREE DIMENSIONAL LABYRINTH IN THE AIR FILLED WITH HANGING GARDENS OF FERNS GROWING OUT OF SOIL WHICH IS POPULATED WITH ALL KINDS OF SMALL ORGANISMS
RichardPreston_2008 THERE ARE EPIPHYTES PLANTS THAT GROW ON TREES THESE ARE HUCKLEBERRY BUSHES MANY SPECIES OF MOSSES AND THEN ALL SORTS OF LICHENS JUST PLASTERING THE TREE
RichardPreston_2008 WHEN YOU GET NEAR THE TOP OF THE TREE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T FALL IN FACT IT'S DIFFICULT TO MOVE YOU'RE WORMING YOUR WAY THROUGH BRANCHES WHICH ARE CROWDED WITH LIVING THINGS THAT DON'T OCCUR NEAR THE GROUND
RichardPreston_2008 IT'S LIKE SCUBA DIVING INTO A CORAL REEF EXCEPT YOU'RE GOING UPWARD INSTEAD OF DOWNWARD AND THEN THE TREES TEND TO FLARE OUT INTO PLATFORM LIKE
RichardPreston_2008 AREAS AT THE TOP MARIA 'S SITTING ON ONE OF THEM THESE LIMBS COULD BE FIVE TO SIX HUNDRED YEARS OLD REDWOODS GROW VERY SLOWLY IN THEIR TOPS
RichardPreston_2008 THEY ALSO HAVE A FEATURE THICKETS OF HUCKLEBERRY BUSHES THAT GROW OUT OF THE TOPS OF REDWOOD TREES THAT ARE TECHNICALLY KNOWN AS HUCKLEBERRY AFROS AND YOU CAN SIT THERE AND SNACK ON THE BERRIES WHILE YOU'RE RESTING
RichardPreston_2008 A REDWOOD IS A FRACTAL AND AS THEY PUT OUT LIMBS THE LIMBS BURST INTO SMALL TREES COPIES OF THE REDWOOD
RichardPreston_2008 NOW HERE WE SEE A REITERATION IN CHRONOS ONE OF THE OLDER REDWOODS THIS REITERATION
RichardPreston_2008 IS A HUGE FLYING BUTTRESS THAT COMES OUT THE TREE ITSELF THIS BUTTRESS IS LESS THAN HALFWAY UP THE TREE
RichardPreston_2008 AND THEN IT BURSTS INTO A FOREST OF REDWOODS THIS PARTICULAR EXTRA TRUNK IS A METER ACROSS AT THE BASE
RichardPreston_2008 AND EXTENDS UPWARD FOR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET IT'S AS BIG AS ANY OF THE BIGGEST TREES EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND YET IT'S ONLY A MINOR FEATURE ON CHRONOS
RichardPreston_2008 THIS THREE DIMENSIONAL MAP OF THE CROWN STRUCTURE OF A REDWOOD NAMED ILUVATAR MADE BY STEVE SILLETT MARIE ANTOINE AND THEIR COLLEAGUES
RichardPreston_2008 GIVES YOU AN IDEA WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE IS A HIERARCHICAL SCHEMATIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRUNKS OF THIS TREE
RichardPreston_2008 AS IT HAS ELABORATED ITSELF OVER TIME INTO SIX LAYERS OF FRACTAL OF TRUNKS SPRINGING FROM TRUNKS SPRINGING FROM TRUNKS
RichardPreston_2008 I ASKED STEVE TO PUT A HUMAN BEING IN THIS TO GIVE A SENSE OF SCALE
RichardPreston_2008 THE PERSON RIGHT THERE
RichardPreston_2008 THE PERSON IS WAVING TO US I'VE WANTED TO ASK CRAIG VENTER
RichardPreston_2008 IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO INSERT A SYNTHETIC CHROMOSOME INTO A HUMAN SO THAT WE COULD REITERATE OURSELVES IF WE WANTED TO AND IF WE WERE ABLE TO REITERATE THEN THE FINGERS OF OUR HAND WOULD BE PEOPLE
RichardPreston_2008 WHO LOOK LIKE US
RichardPreston_2008 AND THEY WOULD HAVE PEOPLE ON THEIR HANDS AND SO ON AND IF WE HAD REDWOOD LIKE BIOLOGY WE WOULD HAVE SIX LAYERS OF PEOPLE ON OUR HANDS AS IT WERE AND IT WOULD BE A LOVELY THING TO BE ABLE TO WAVE TO SOMEONE AND HAVE ALL OUR REITERATIONS WAVE AT THE SAME TIME
RichardPreston_2008 TO REITERATE THE POINT
RichardPreston_2008 LET 'S GO CLOSER INTO
RichardPreston_2008 WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT YELLOW BOX
RichardPreston_2008 THIS HALLUCINATORY DRAWING SHOWS YOU EVERYTHING YOU SEE IN THIS DRAWING IS
RichardPreston_2008 THESE ARE MILLENNIAL STRUCTURES PORTIONS OF THE TREE THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND YEARS OLD THERE ARE FOUR HUMANS IN THIS SHOT ONE TWO
RichardPreston_2008 AND THIS FLYING BUTTRESS IS A LIMB SHOT OUT OF THAT SMALL TRUNK GOING BACK INTO THE MAIN TRUNK AND FUSING WITH IT FLYING BUTTRESSES JUST AS IN A CATHEDRAL HELP STRENGTHEN THE CROWN OF THE TREE AND HELP THE TREE EXIST LONGER THROUGH TIME
RichardPreston_2008 THE SCIENTISTS ARE DOING ALL KINDS OF EXPERIMENTS IN THESE TREES THEY'VE WIRED THEM LIKE PATIENTS IN AN
RichardPreston_2008 OUT THAT REDWOODS CAN MOVE MOISTURE OUT OF THE AIR AND DOWN INTO THEIR TRUNKS POSSIBLY ALL THE WAY INTO THEIR ROOT SYSTEMS THEY ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY
RichardPreston_2008 TO PUT ROOTS ANYWHERE IN THE TREE ITSELF IF A PORTION OF A REDWOOD IS ROTTING THE REDWOOD WILL SEND ROOTS INTO ITS OWN FORM AND DRAW NUTRIENTS OUT OF ITSELF AS IT FALLS APART
RichardPreston_2008 AS YET NO NAMES THIS IS AN UNNAMED SPECIES OF COPAPOD A COPAPOD IS A CRUSTACEAN THESE COPAPODS ARE A MAJOR CONSTITUENT
RichardPreston_2008 OF THE OCEANS AND THEY ARE A MAJOR PART OF THE DIET OF GRAZING BALEEN WHALES WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN
RichardPreston_2008 THE REDWOOD FOREST CANOPY SOIL HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THE OCEAN OR HOW THEY GOT THERE IS COMPLETELY UNKNOWN
RichardPreston_2008 THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING THEORIES THAT IF I HAD TIME I WOULD TELL YOU ABOUT BUT AS YOU GO AND YOU LOOK CLOSER AT A TREE WHAT YOU SEE IS YOU SEE INCREASING COMPLEXITY
RichardPreston_2008 WE'RE LOOKING AT THE VERY TOP OF GAYA WHICH IS THOUGHT TO BE THE OLDEST REDWOOD GAYA MAY BE THREE THOUSAND TO FIVE THOUSAND YEARS OLD NO ONE REALLY KNOWS
RichardPreston_2008 THIS LITTLE JAPANESE GARDEN LIKE
RichardPreston_2008 I HAVE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING UNFORTUNATELY VERY SAD AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS TALK
RichardPreston_2008 THE EASTERN HEMLOCK TREE HAS OFTEN BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE REDWOOD OF THE EAST AND WE'RE MOVING A FULL CIRCLE NOW IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES A SMALL ORGANISM APPEARED IN RICHMOND VIRGINIA CALLED THE HEMLOCK WOOLLY ADELGID
RichardPreston_2008 IT MADE A TRANS SPECIES JUMP OUT OF SOME OTHER ORGANISM IN ASIA WHERE IT WAS LIVING ON HEMLOCK TREES IN ASIA WHEN IT MOVED INTO ITS NEW HOST THE EASTERN HEMLOCK TREE IT ESCAPED ITS PREDATORS
RichardPreston_2008 AND THE NEW TREE HAD NO RESISTANCE TO IT THE EASTERN HEMLOCK FOREST IS BEING CONSIDERED IN SOME WAYS THE LAST FRAGMENTS
RichardPreston_2008 OF PRIMEVAL RAINFOREST EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER I HADN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THERE WERE RAINFORESTS IN THE EAST BUT IN GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK IT CAN RAIN UP TO ONE HUNDRED INCHES OF RAIN A YEAR
RichardPreston_2008 AND IN THE LAST TWO TO THREE SUMMERS THESE INVASIVE ORGANISMS
RichardPreston_2008 THIS KIND OF EBOLA OF THE TREES AS IT WERE HAS SWEPT THROUGH THE PRIMEVAL HEMLOCK FOREST OF THE EAST AND HAS ABSOLUTELY WIPED IT OUT
RichardPreston_2008 I CLIMBED THERE THIS PAST SUMMER THIS IS GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK AND THE HEMLOCKS ARE DEAD AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE
RichardPreston_2008 AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS NOT JUST THE POTENTIAL DEATH OF THE EASTERN HEMLOCK SPECIES THAT IS TO SAY ITS EXTINCTION FROM NATURE DUE TO THIS INVADING PARASITE
RichardPreston_2008 BUT WE'RE ALSO SEEING THE DEATH OF AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX ECOSYSTEM FOR WHICH THESE TREES ARE MERELY THE SUBSTRATE FOR THE AERIAL LABYRINTH OF THE SKY THAT EXISTS IN THEIR CROWNS
RichardPreston_2008 IT'S ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING TO SEE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS JUST I ALMOST CAN'T CONCEIVE IT IS
RichardPreston_2008 THE IDEA THAT THE NATIONAL NEWS MEDIA HASN'T PICKED THIS UP AT ALL AND THIS IS THE DEVASTATION OF ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEMS IN NORTH AMERICA
RichardPreston_2008 WHAT CAN THE REDWOODS TELL US ABOUT OURSELVES
RichardPreston_2008 WELL I THINK THEY CAN TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT HUMAN TIME THE FLICKERING
RichardPreston_2008 AND THE BREVITY OF HUMAN LIFE THE NECESSITY TO LOVE
RichardPreston_2008 BUT WE'RE DIFFERENT FROM TREES AND THEY CAN ALSO TEACH US SOMETHING ABOUT OURSELVES IN THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE HAVE
RichardPreston_2008 WE ARE HUMAN AND WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO LOVE WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO WONDER AND WE HAVE A SORT OF BOUNDLESS CURIOSITY A RESTLESS INQUISITIVENESS THAT SO SUITS US AS PRIMATES I THINK
RichardPreston_2008 AND AT LEAST FOR ME PERSONALLY THE TREES HAVE TAUGHT ME AN ENTIRELY NEW WAY OF LOVING MY CHILDREN
RichardPreston_2008 AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE HAPPIEST THINGS IS THE SENSE THAT WITH MY CHILDREN I'VE BEEN ABLE TO INTRODUCE THEM TO THE VERY SMALL CIRCLE OF HUMANS WHO ARE LUCKY ENOUGH OR POSSIBLY STUPID ENOUGH
RichardPreston_2008 AND MANY OF THEM ARE ECOSYSTEMS THAT ARE SPECIES THAT ARE NOT FOUND ANYWHERE ON THE EARTH EXCEPT ON THAT ONE TREE
RichardPreston_2008 AND WHILE WE WERE CLIMBING HYPERION MARIE ANTOINE SPOTTED AN UNKNOWN SPECIES OF GOLDEN BROWN ANT ABOUT HALFWAY UP THE
RichardPreston_2008 NOT KNOWN TO OCCUR IN REDWOOD TREES CURIOUSLY ENOUGH AND WE WONDERED WHETHER THIS ANT THIS SPECIES OF ANT WAS ONLY ENDEMIC TO THIS ONE TREE OR POSSIBLY TO THAT
RichardPreston_2008 AND IN SUBSEQUENT CLIMBS THEY COULD NEVER FIND THAT ANT AGAIN AND SO NO SPECIMENS HAVE EVER BEEN COLLECTED WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS WE JUST KNOW IT'S THERE
RichardPreston_2008 SO YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHEN YOU KNOW IF SOME OTHER
RichardPreston_2008 SPECIES THAN US WAS RECORDING THE STORIES THAT MATTERED ON
RichardPreston_2008 YOU KNOW OUR STORIES ARE ABOUT IRAQ AND WAR AND POLITICS
RichardPreston_2008 IT'S AN AMAZING SENSE OF WONDER YOU'VE GIVEN ME AND A SENSE OF JUST HOW FRAGILE THIS WHOLE THING
RichardPreston_2008 IT IS FRAGILE AND YOU KNOW I THINK ABOUT EMERGING HUMAN DISEASES PARASITES THAT MOVE INTO THE HUMAN SPECIES BUT THAT'S JUST A VERY SMALL
RichardPreston_2008 RICHARD PRESTON THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK
