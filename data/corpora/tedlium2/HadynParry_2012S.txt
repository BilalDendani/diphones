HadynParry_2012S BUT OF COURSE THE MOST DANGEROUS ANIMAL IS THE MOSQUITO THE MOSQUITO HAS KILLED MORE HUMANS THAN ANY OTHER CREATURE IN HUMAN HISTORY IN FACT PROBABLY ADDING THEM ALL TOGETHER THE MOSQUITO HAS KILLED MORE HUMANS AND THE MOSQUITO HAS KILLED MORE HUMANS THAN WARS AND PLAGUE AND YOU WOULD THINK
HadynParry_2012S WOULD YOU NOT THAT WITH ALL OUR SCIENCE WITH ALL OUR ADVANCES IN SOCIETY WITH BETTER TOWNS BETTER CIVILIZATIONS BETTER SANITATION WEALTH
HadynParry_2012S IF IT WAS THE CASE WE WOULDN 'T HAVE
HadynParry_2012S BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED MILLION CASES OF MALARIA EVERY YEAR AND WE WOULDN 'T HAVE A MILLION AND A HALF DEATHS FROM MALARIA AND WE WOULDN 'T HAVE
HadynParry_2012S A DISEASE THAT WAS RELATIVELY UNKNOWN FIFTY YEARS AGO NOW SUDDENLY TURNED INTO THE LARGEST MOSQUITO BORNE VIRUS THREAT THAT WE HAVE AND THAT 'S CALLED DENGUE FEVER
HadynParry_2012S SO FIFTY YEARS AGO PRETTY MUCH NO ONE HAD HEARD OF IT NO ONE CERTAINLY IN THE EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENT BUT DENGUE FEVER NOW ACCORDING TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION INFECTS BETWEEN FIFTY AND ONE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE EVERY YEAR SO THAT 'S EQUIVALENT TO THE WHOLE OF THE POPULATION OF THE U K BEING INFECTED EVERY YEAR
HadynParry_2012S OTHER ESTIMATES PUT THAT NUMBER AT ROUGHLY DOUBLE THAT NUMBER OF INFECTIONS
HadynParry_2012S AND
HadynParry_2012S OR YOU MIGHT GO TO MEXICO YOU MIGHT GO TO LATIN AMERICA ASIA AFRICA
HadynParry_2012S FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS THEY COULD BE QUITE MILD
HadynParry_2012S YOU COULD DEVELOP NAUSEA HEADACHE
HadynParry_2012S YOUR MUSCLES COULD FEEL LIKE THEY 'RE CONTRACTING AND YOU COULD ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE YOUR BONES ARE BREAKING AND THAT 'S THE NICKNAME GIVEN TO THIS DISEASE IT 'S CALLED BREAKBONE FEVER BECAUSE THAT 'S HOW YOU CAN FEEL
HadynParry_2012S NOW THE ODD THING IS IS THAT ONCE YOU 'VE BEEN BITTEN BY THIS MOSQUITO AND YOU 'VE HAD THIS DISEASE YOUR BODY DEVELOPS ANTIBODIES
HadynParry_2012S SO IF YOU 'RE BITTEN AGAIN WITH THAT STRAIN
HadynParry_2012S SO THE NEXT TIME YOU GET DENGUE FEVER IF IT 'S A DIFFERENT STRAIN YOU 'RE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE YOU 'RE LIKELY TO GET WORSE SYMPTOMS AND YOU 'RE MORE LIKELY TO GET THE MORE SEVERE FORMS HEMORRHAGIC FEVER OR SHOCK SYNDROME
HadynParry_2012S SO YOU DON 'T WANT DENGUE ONCE AND YOU CERTAINLY DON 'T WANT IT AGAIN
HadynParry_2012S SO WHY IS IT SPREADING SO FAST AND THE ANSWER IS THIS THING THIS IS AEDES AEGYPTI NOW THIS IS A MOSQUITO THAT CAME LIKE ITS NAME SUGGESTS OUT OF NORTH AFRICA
HadynParry_2012S A SINGLE MOSQUITO WILL ONLY TRAVEL ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS IN ITS ENTIRE LIFE THEY DON 'T TRAVEL VERY FAR WHAT THEY 'RE VERY GOOD AT DOING IS HITCHHIKING PARTICULARLY THE EGGS THEY WILL LAY THEIR EGGS IN CLEAR WATER ANY POOL ANY PUDDLE
HadynParry_2012S ANY BIRDBATH ANY FLOWER POT ANYWHERE THERE 'S CLEAR WATER THEY 'LL LAY THEIR EGGS AND IF THAT CLEAR WATER IS NEAR FREIGHT IT 'S NEAR A PORT IF IT 'S ANYWHERE NEAR TRANSPORT THOSE EGGS WILL THEN GET TRANSPORTED AROUND THE WORLD
HadynParry_2012S AND THAT 'S WHAT 'S HAPPENED MANKIND HAS TRANSPORTED THESE EGGS ALL THE WAY AROUND THE WORLD AND THESE INSECTS HAVE INFESTED OVER ONE HUNDRED COUNTRIES AND THERE 'S NOW TWO POINT FIVE BILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN COUNTRIES WHERE THIS MOSQUITO RESIDES
HadynParry_2012S AND CURRENTLY THEY SPEND ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS NOW A YEAR TRYING TO GET RID OF IT TRYING TO CONTROL IT JUST ONE SPECIES OF MOSQUITO
HadynParry_2012S TWO DAYS AGO OR YESTERDAY I CAN 'T REMEMBER WHICH I SAW A REUTERS REPORT THAT SAID MADEIRA HAD HAD THEIR FIRST CASES OF DENGUE ABOUT FIFTY TWO CASES WITH ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED PROBABLE CASES THAT 'S TWO DAYS AGO
HadynParry_2012S ANYONE COMING INTO THAT AREA WITH DENGUE MOSQUITO WILL BITE THEM MOSQUITO WILL BITE SOMEWHERE ELSE SOMEWHERE ELSE SOMEWHERE ELSE AND YOU 'LL GET
HadynParry_2012S AN EPIDEMIC
HadynParry_2012S NOW IN AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT THAT 'S EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT YOU 'VE GOT TO GET YOUR CHEMICAL INTO EVERY PUDDLE EVERY BIRDBATH EVERY TREE TRUNK IT 'S JUST NOT
HadynParry_2012S YOU COULD DO THE SAME WITH A SPACE SPRAY THIS IS REALLY UNPLEASANT STUFF AND IF IT WAS ANY GOOD WE WOULDN 'T HAVE THIS MASSIVE INCREASE IN MOSQUITOS AND WE WOULDN 'T HAVE THIS MASSIVE INCREASE IN DENGUE FEVER SO IT 'S NOT VERY EFFECTIVE BUT IT 'S PROBABLY THE BEST THING WE 'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT
HadynParry_2012S HAVING SAID THAT ACTUALLY YOUR BEST FORM OF PROTECTION AND MY BEST FORM OF PROTECTION IS A LONG SLEEVE SHIRT
HadynParry_2012S AND A LITTLE BIT OF DEET TO GO WITH IT SO LET 'S
HadynParry_2012S START AGAIN LET 'S DESIGN A PRODUCT RIGHT FROM THE WORD GO AND DECIDE WHAT WE WANT WELL WE CLEARLY NEED SOMETHING THAT IS EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING THE MOSQUITO POPULATION THERE 'S NO POINT IN JUST KILLING THE ODD MOSQUITO HERE AND THERE WE WANT SOMETHING THAT GETS THAT POPULATION RIGHT THE WAY DOWN SO IT CAN 'T GET THE DISEASE TRANSMISSION
HadynParry_2012S MAYBE A BETTER PRODUCT COMES ALONG IN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS FINE WE DON 'T WANT A LASTING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT WE WANT SOMETHING THAT 'S RELATIVELY CHEAP OR COST EFFECTIVE BECAUSE THERE 'S AN AWFUL LOT OF COUNTRIES INVOLVED AND SOME OF THEM ARE EMERGING MARKETS SOME OF THEM EMERGING COUNTRIES LOW INCOME
HadynParry_2012S AND FINALLY YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT 'S SPECIES SPECIFIC YOU WANT TO GET RID OF THIS MOSQUITO THAT SPREADS DENGUE BUT YOU DON 'T REALLY WANT TO GET ALL THE OTHER INSECTS SOME ARE QUITE BENEFICIAL SOME ARE IMPORTANT TO YOUR ECOSYSTEM THIS ONE 'S NOT IT 'S INVADED YOU BUT YOU DON 'T WANT TO GET ALL OF THE INSECTS YOU JUST WANT TO GET THIS ONE
HadynParry_2012S AND MOST OF THE TIME YOU 'LL FIND THIS INSECT LIVES IN AND AROUND YOUR HOME SO THIS
HadynParry_2012S WHATEVER WE DO HAS GOT TO GET TO THAT INSECT IT 'S GOT TO GET INTO PEOPLE 'S HOUSES INTO THE BEDROOMS INTO THE KITCHENS NOW THERE ARE TWO
HadynParry_2012S FEATURES OF MOSQUITO BIOLOGY THAT REALLY HELP US IN THIS PROJECT AND THAT IS FIRSTLY MALES DON 'T BITE IT 'S ONLY THE FEMALE MOSQUITO THAT WILL ACTUALLY BITE YOU THE MALE CAN 'T BITE YOU WON 'T BITE YOU DOESN 'T HAVE THE MOUTH PARTS TO BITE YOU IT 'S JUST THE FEMALE
HadynParry_2012S AND THE SECOND IS A PHENOMENON THAT MALES ARE VERY VERY GOOD AT FINDING FEMALES
HadynParry_2012S IF THERE 'S A MALE MOSQUITO THAT YOU RELEASE AND IF THERE 'S A FEMALE AROUND THAT MALE WILL FIND THE FEMALE
HadynParry_2012S SO BASICALLY WE 'VE USED THOSE TWO FACTORS
HadynParry_2012S SO HERE 'S A TYPICAL SITUATION MALE MEETS FEMALE LOTS OF OFFSPRING A SINGLE FEMALE WILL LAY ABOUT UP TO ONE HUNDRED EGGS AT A TIME UP TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED IN HER LIFETIME NOW IF THAT MALE IS CARRYING A GENE WHICH CAUSES THE DEATH OF THE OFFSPRING
HadynParry_2012S THEN THE OFFSPRING DON 'T SURVIVE
HadynParry_2012S AND INSTEAD OF HAVING FIVE HUNDRED MOSQUITOS RUNNING AROUND YOU HAVE NONE
HadynParry_2012S AND IF YOU CAN PUT MORE I 'LL CALL THEM STERILE THAT THE OFFSPRING WILL ACTUALLY DIE AT DIFFERENT STAGES BUT I 'LL CALL THEM STERILE FOR NOW IF YOU PUT MORE STERILE MALES OUT INTO THE ENVIRONMENT THEN THE FEMALES ARE MORE LIKELY TO FIND A STERILE MALE THAN A FERTILE ONE AND YOU WILL BRING THAT POPULATION DOWN
HadynParry_2012S SO THE MALES WILL GO OUT THEY 'LL LOOK FOR FEMALES THEY 'LL MATE IF THEY MATE SUCCESSFULLY
HadynParry_2012S THEN NO OFFSPRING IF THEY DON 'T FIND A FEMALE
HadynParry_2012S SO THIS IS TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN OXFORD UNIVERSITY A FEW YEARS AGO
HadynParry_2012S THE COMPANY ITSELF OXITEC WE 'VE BEEN WORKING FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS VERY MUCH ON A SORT OF SIMILAR DEVELOPMENT PATHWAY THAT YOU 'D GET WITH A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY SO ABOUT TEN YEARS OF INTERNAL
HadynParry_2012S EVALUATION TESTING TO GET THIS TO A STATE WHERE WE THINK IT 'S ACTUALLY READY
HadynParry_2012S AND THEN WE 'VE GONE OUT INTO THE BIG OUTDOORS ALWAYS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY CONSENT ALWAYS WITH THE NECESSARY PERMITS SO WE 'VE DONE FIELD TRIALS NOW IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS A SMALL ONE IN MALAYSIA AND TWO MORE NOW IN BRAZIL AND WHAT 'S THE RESULT
HadynParry_2012S WELL THE RESULT HAS BEEN VERY GOOD IN ABOUT FOUR MONTHS OF RELEASE WE 'VE BROUGHT THAT POPULATION OF MOSQUITOS IN MOST CASES WE 'RE DEALING WITH VILLAGES HERE OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT SORT OF SIZE STARTING SMALL
HadynParry_2012S WE 'VE TAKEN THAT MOSQUITO POPULATION DOWN BY ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT IN ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AND IN FACT THE NUMBERS AFTER THAT GET THOSE GET VERY DIFFICULT TO COUNT BECAUSE THERE JUST AREN 'T ANY LEFT
HadynParry_2012S SO THAT 'S BEEN WHAT WE 'VE SEEN IN CAYMAN IT 'S BEEN WHAT WE 'VE SEEN IN BRAZIL IN THOSE TRIALS
HadynParry_2012S AND NOW WHAT WE 'RE DOING IS WE 'RE GOING THROUGH A PROCESS TO SCALE UP TO A TOWN OF ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND SO WE CAN SEE THIS WORK AT BIG SCALE
HadynParry_2012S AND WE 'VE GOT A PRODUCTION UNIT IN OXFORD OR JUST SOUTH OF OXFORD WHERE WE ACTUALLY PRODUCE THESE MOSQUITOS WE CAN PRODUCE THEM IN A SPACE A BIT MORE THAN THIS RED CARPET I CAN PRODUCE ABOUT TWENTY MILLION A WEEK
HadynParry_2012S WE CAN TRANSPORT THEM AROUND THE WORLD IT 'S NOT VERY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE IT 'S A COFFEE CUP SOMETHING THE SIZE OF A COFFEE CUP WILL HOLD ABOUT THREE MILLION EGGS
HadynParry_2012S SO FREIGHT COSTS AREN 'T OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM
HadynParry_2012S FOR SCALING UP IN BRAZIL
HadynParry_2012S AND THE TRUCK IS GOING DOWN THE ROAD AND THEY ARE RELEASING MALES AS THEY GO IT 'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT MORE PRECISE THAN THAT YOU WANT TO RELEASE THEM SO THAT YOU GET GOOD COVERAGE OF YOUR AREA SO YOU TAKE A GOOGLE MAP YOU DIVIDE IT UP WORK OUT HOW FAR THEY CAN FLY AND MAKE SURE YOU 'RE RELEASING SUCH THAT YOU GET COVERAGE OF THE AREA AND THEN YOU GO BACK
HadynParry_2012S AND WITHIN A VERY SHORT SPACE OF TIME YOU 'RE BRINGING THAT POPULATION RIGHT THE WAY DOWN WE 'VE ALSO DONE THIS IN AGRICULTURE WE 'VE GOT SEVERAL DIFFERENT SPECIES OF AGRICULTURE COMING ALONG AND I 'M HOPING THAT SOON WE 'LL BE ABLE TO GET SOME FUNDING TOGETHER SO WE CAN GET BACK
HadynParry_2012S AND START LOOKING AT MALARIA SO THAT 'S WHERE WE STAND AT THE MOMENT AND I 'VE JUST GOT A FEW FINAL THOUGHTS WHICH IS THAT
HadynParry_2012S THIS IS ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH BIOLOGY IS NOW COMING IN TO SUPPLEMENT CHEMISTRY IN SOME OF OUR SOCIETAL ADVANCES IN THIS AREA
HadynParry_2012S AND THESE BIOLOGICAL APPROACHES ARE COMING IN IN VERY DIFFERENT FORMS
HadynParry_2012S AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT GENETIC ENGINEERING WE 'VE NOW GOT ENZYMES FOR INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING ENZYMES GENETICALLY ENGINEERED ENZYMES IN FOOD WE HAVE G M CROPS WE HAVE PHARMACEUTICALS WE HAVE NEW VACCINES ALL USING ROUGHLY THE SAME TECHNOLOGY BUT WITH VERY DIFFERENT OUTCOMES
HadynParry_2012S AND I 'M IN FAVOR ACTUALLY OF COURSE I AM I 'M IN FAVOR OF PARTICULARLY WHERE THE OLDER TECHNOLOGIES DON 'T WORK WELL OR HAVE BECOME UNACCEPTABLE AND
HadynParry_2012S ALTHOUGH THE TECHNIQUES ARE SIMILAR THE OUTCOMES ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT AND IF YOU TAKE OUR APPROACH FOR EXAMPLE AND YOU COMPARE IT TO SAY G M CROPS BOTH TECHNIQUES ARE TRYING TO PRODUCE A MASSIVE BENEFIT BOTH HAVE A SIDE BENEFIT WHICH IS THAT WE REDUCE PESTICIDE
HadynParry_2012S USE TREMENDOUSLY BUT WHEREAS A G M CROP IS TRYING TO PROTECT THE PLANT FOR EXAMPLE AND GIVE IT AN ADVANTAGE WHAT WE 'RE ACTUALLY DOING IS TAKING THE MOSQUITO AND GIVING IT THE BIGGEST DISADVANTAGE IT CAN POSSIBLY HAVE
