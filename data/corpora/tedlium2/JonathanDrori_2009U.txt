JonathanDrori_2009U LIFE ALL LIFE DEPENDS ON PLANTS LET ME TRY TO CONVINCE YOU OF THAT IN A FEW SECONDS
JonathanDrori_2009U JUST THINK FOR A MOMENT IT DOESN 'T MATTER WHETHER YOU LIVE IN A SMALL AFRICAN VILLAGE OR YOU LIVE IN A BIG CITY EVERYTHING COMES BACK TO PLANTS IN THE END WHETHER IT 'S FOR THE FOOD THE MEDICINE THE FUEL THE CONSTRUCTION THE CLOTHING ALL THE OBVIOUS THINGS OR WHETHER IT 'S FOR THE SPIRITUAL AND RECREATIONAL THINGS THAT MATTER TO US SO MUCH
JonathanDrori_2009U OR WHETHER IT 'S SOIL FORMATION OR THE EFFECT ON THE ATMOSPHERE OR PRIMARY PRODUCTION DAMN IT EVEN THE BOOKS HERE ARE MADE OUT OF PLANTS ALL THESE THINGS
JonathanDrori_2009U NOW PLANTS ARE UNDER THREAT THEY 'RE UNDER THREAT BECAUSE OF CHANGING CLIMATE AND THEY ARE ALSO UNDER THREAT BECAUSE THEY ARE SHARING A PLANET WITH PEOPLE LIKE US AND PEOPLE LIKE US WANT TO DO THINGS THAT DESTROY PLANTS AND THEIR HABITATS
JonathanDrori_2009U OR BECAUSE OF HABITATS BEING USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES ALL THESE THINGS ARE MEANING THAT PLANTS HAVE TO ADAPT OR DIE
JonathanDrori_2009U OR MOVE AND PLANTS SOMETIMES FIND IT RATHER DIFFICULT TO MOVE BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE CITIES AND OTHER THINGS IN THE WAY
JonathanDrori_2009U SO IF ALL HUMAN LIFE DEPENDS ON PLANTS DOESN 'T IT MAKE SENSE THAT PERHAPS WE SHOULD TRY TO SAVE THEM I THINK IT DOES AND I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT A PROJECT TO SAVE PLANTS AND THE WAY THAT YOU SAVE PLANTS
JonathanDrori_2009U IS BY STORING SEEDS BECAUSE SEEDS IN ALL THEIR DIVERSE GLORY ARE PLANTS FUTURES
JonathanDrori_2009U ALL THE GENETIC INFORMATION FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF PLANTS ARE HELD IN SEEDS SO HERE IS THE BUILDING IT LOOKS RATHER UNASSUMING REALLY BUT IT GOES DOWN BELOW GROUND MANY STORIES AND IT 'S THE LARGEST SEED BANK IN THE WORLD
JonathanDrori_2009U THIS IS A NUCLEAR PROOF FACILITY GOD FORBID THAT IT SHOULD HAVE TO WITHSTAND THAT
JonathanDrori_2009U SO IF YOU 'RE GOING TO BUILD A SEED BANK YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT YOU 'RE GOING TO STORE IN IT RIGHT AND WE DECIDED THAT WHAT WE WANT TO STORE FIRST OF ALL ARE THE SPECIES THAT ARE MOST UNDER THREAT AND THOSE ARE THE DRY LAND SPECIES
JonathanDrori_2009U SO FIRST OF ALL WE DID DEALS
JonathanDrori_2009U WITH FIFTY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IT MEANS NEGOTIATING WITH HEADS OF STATE AND WITH SECRETARIES OF STATE IN FIFTY COUNTRIES TO SIGN TREATIES
JonathanDrori_2009U EXACTLY HOW THEY 'RE GOING TO COLLECT THESE SEEDS THEY HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD TAGGING PLACES WHERE THOSE PLANTS ARE SAID TO EXIST THEY SEARCH FOR THEM THEY FIND THEM IN FLOWER AND THEY GO BACK
JonathanDrori_2009U WHEN THEIR SEEDS HAVE ARRIVED AND THEY COLLECT THE SEEDS ALL OVER THE WORLD
JonathanDrori_2009U THE SEEDS SOME OF IF IS VERY UNTECHNICAL YOU KIND OF SHOVEL THEM ALL IN TO BAGS AND DRY THEM OFF YOU LABEL THEM YOU DO SOME HIGH TECH THINGS HERE AND THERE SOME LOW TECH THINGS HERE AND THERE
JonathanDrori_2009U AND THE MAIN THING IS THAT YOU HAVE TO DRY THEM VERY CAREFULLY AT LOW TEMPERATURE AND THEN YOU HAVE TO STORE THEM AT ABOUT MINUS TWENTY DEGREES C THAT 'S ABOUT MINUS FOUR FAHRENHEIT I THINK WITH A VERY CRITICALLY LOW MOISTURE CONTENT
JonathanDrori_2009U AND THESE SEEDS WILL BE ABLE TO GERMINATE WE BELIEVE WITH MANY OF THE SPECIES IN THOUSANDS OF YEARS
JonathanDrori_2009U AND CERTAINLY IN HUNDREDS OF YEARS IT 'S NO GOOD STORING THE SEEDS IF YOU DON 'T KNOW THEY 'RE STILL VIABLE SO EVERY TEN YEARS WE DO GERMINATION TESTS ON EVERY SAMPLE OF SEEDS THAT WE HAVE
JonathanDrori_2009U AND THIS IS A DISTRIBUTED NETWORK SO ALL AROUND THE WORLD PEOPLE ARE DOING THE SAME THING
JonathanDrori_2009U AND THAT ENABLES US TO DEVELOP GERMINATION PROTOCOLS THAT MEANS THAT WE KNOW THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF HEAT AND COLD AND THE CYCLES THAT YOU HAVE TO GET TO MAKE THE SEED GERMINATE AND THAT IS VERY USEFUL INFORMATION
JonathanDrori_2009U AND THEN WE GROW THESE THINGS AND WE TELL PEOPLE BACK IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE THESE SEEDS HAVE COME FROM LOOK ACTUALLY WE 'RE NOT JUST STORING THIS TO GET THE SEEDS LATER BUT WE CAN GIVE YOU THIS INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO GERMINATE THESE DIFFICULT PLANTS AND THAT 'S ALREADY HAPPENING
JonathanDrori_2009U SO WHERE HAVE WE GOT TO I AM PLEASED TO UNVEIL THAT OUR THREE BILLIONTH SEED THAT 'S THREE THOUSAND MILLIONTH SEED
JonathanDrori_2009U IS NOW STORED TEN PERCENT OF ALL PLANT SPECIES ON THE PLANET TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND SPECIES ARE SAFE THIRTY THOUSAND SPECIES IF WE GET THE FUNDING BY NEXT YEAR
JonathanDrori_2009U TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL THE WORLD 'S PLANTS BY TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY THESE ARE NOT JUST CROP PLANTS AS YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN STORED IN SVALBARD IN NORWAY FANTASTIC WORK THERE THIS IS AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED TIMES BIGGER
JonathanDrori_2009U WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF COLLECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SENT OUT ALL OVER THE WORLD DROUGHT TOLERANT FOREST SPECIES SENT TO PAKISTAN AND EGYPT ESPECIALLY PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENT
JonathanDrori_2009U PLANTS COME HERE TO THE UNITED STATES SALT TOLERANT PASTURE SPECIES SENT TO AUSTRALIA THE LIST GOES ON AND ON
JonathanDrori_2009U SOME OF THESE PLANTS LIKE THE ONES ON THE BOTTOM TO THE LEFT OF YOUR SCREEN THEY ARE DOWN TO THE LAST FEW REMAINING MEMBERS THE ONE WHERE THE GUY IS COLLECTING SEEDS THERE ON THE TRUCK THAT IS DOWN TO ABOUT THIRTY LAST REMAINING TREES FANTASTICALLY USEFUL PLANT BOTH FOR PROTEIN AND FOR MEDICINE
JonathanDrori_2009U WE HAVE TRAINING GOING ON IN CHINA IN THE USA AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES
JonathanDrori_2009U HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS PER SPECIES IS THE AVERAGE I THINK THAT 'S CHEAP AT THE PRICE
