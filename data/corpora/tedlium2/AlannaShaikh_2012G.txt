AlannaShaikh_2012G@16.29:27.99 TO TALK ABOUT MY DAD MY DAD HAS ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE HE STARTED SHOWING THE SYMPTOMS ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO AND HE WAS OFFICIALLY DIAGNOSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE
AlannaShaikh_2012G@27.99:47.15 NOW HE 'S REALLY PRETTY SICK HE NEEDS HELP EATING HE NEEDS HELP GETTING DRESSED HE DOESN 'T REALLY KNOW WHERE HE IS OR WHEN IT IS AND IT 'S BEEN REALLY REALLY HARD MY DAD WAS MY HERO AND MY MENTOR FOR MOST OF MY LIFE AND I 'VE SPENT THE LAST DECADE WATCHING HIM DISAPPEAR
AlannaShaikh_2012G@47.15:50.83 MY DAD 'S NOT ALONE THERE 'S ABOUT
AlannaShaikh_2012G@51.06:61.57 THIRTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE GLOBALLY LIVING WITH SOME KIND OF DEMENTIA AND BY TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTY THEY 'RE EXPECTING THAT TO DOUBLE TO SEVENTY MILLION THAT 'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
AlannaShaikh_2012G@62.5:81.22 DEMENTIA SCARES US THE CONFUSED FACES AND SHAKY HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEMENTIA THE BIG NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO GET IT THEY FRIGHTEN US AND BECAUSE OF THAT FEAR WE TEND TO DO ONE OF TWO THINGS WE GO INTO DENIAL IT 'S NOT ME IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME IT 'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME
AlannaShaikh_2012G@81.42:89.09 OR WE DECIDE THAT WE 'RE GOING TO PREVENT DEMENTIA AND IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN TO US BECAUSE WE 'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING RIGHT AND IT WON 'T COME AND
AlannaShaikh_2012G@89.09:92.87 US I 'M LOOKING FOR A THIRD WAY
AlannaShaikh_2012G@92.93:95.41 I 'M PREPARING TO GET ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE
AlannaShaikh_2012G@96.69:102.43 PREVENTION IS GOOD AND I 'M DOING THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO PREVENT ALZHEIMER 'S I 'M EATING RIGHT
AlannaShaikh_2012G@133.87:137.59 ESPECIALLY IF YOU 'RE ME CAUSE ALZHEIMER 'S TENDS TO RUN IN FAMILIES
AlannaShaikh_2012G@138.21:141.62 SO I 'M PREPARING TO GET ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE
AlannaShaikh_2012G@142.03:150.61 BASED ON WHAT I 'VE LEARNED FROM TAKING CARE OF MY FATHER AND RESEARCHING WHAT IT 'S LIKE TO LIVE WITH DEMENTIA I 'M FOCUSING ON THREE THINGS IN MY PREPARATION
AlannaShaikh_2012G@154.17:160.75 I 'M WORKING TO BUILD MY PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND THIS IS THE HARD ONE I 'M TRYING TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON
AlannaShaikh_2012G@162.1:164.23 LET 'S START WITH THE HOBBIES
AlannaShaikh_2012G@169.2:179.97 YOU CAN 'T SIT AND HAVE LONG TALKS WITH YOUR OLD FRIENDS BECAUSE YOU DON 'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE IT 'S CONFUSING TO WATCH TELEVISION AND OFTEN VERY FRIGHTENING AND READING IS JUST ABOUT IMPOSSIBLE
AlannaShaikh_2012G@180.06:199.61 WHEN YOU CARE FOR SOMEONE WITH DEMENTIA AND YOU GET TRAINING THEY TRAIN YOU TO ENGAGE THEM IN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE FAMILIAR HANDS ON OPEN ENDED WITH MY DAD THAT TURNED OUT TO BE LETTING HIM FILL OUT FORMS HE WAS A COLLEGE PROFESSOR AT A STATE SCHOOL HE KNOWS WHAT PAPERWORK LOOKS LIKE
AlannaShaikh_2012G@206.58:210.09 BUT IT GOT ME THINKING WHAT WOULD MY CAREGIVERS DO WITH ME
AlannaShaikh_2012G@212.69:223.07 I READ I WRITE I THINK ABOUT GLOBAL HEALTH A LOT WOULD THEY GIVE ME ACADEMIC JOURNALS SO I COULD SCRIBBLE IN THE MARGINS WOULD THEY GIVE ME CHARTS AND GRAPHS THAT I COULD COLOR
AlannaShaikh_2012G@223.75:227.16 SO I 'VE BEEN TRYING TO LEARN TO DO THINGS THAT ARE HANDS ON
AlannaShaikh_2012G@227.7:236.02 I 'VE ALWAYS LIKED TO DRAW SO I 'M DOING IT MORE EVEN THOUGH I 'M REALLY VERY BAD AT IT I AM LEARNING SOME BASIC ORIGAMI
AlannaShaikh_2012G@236.04:238.08 I CAN MAKE A REALLY GREAT BOX
AlannaShaikh_2012G@240.94:244.54 AND I 'M TEACHING MYSELF TO KNIT WHICH SO FAR I CAN KNIT A BLOB
AlannaShaikh_2012G@247.11:260.5 BUT YOU KNOW IT DOESN 'T MATTER IF I 'M ACTUALLY GOOD AT IT WHAT MATTERS IS THAT MY HANDS KNOW HOW TO DO IT BECAUSE THE MORE THINGS THAT ARE FAMILIAR THE MORE THINGS MY HANDS KNOW HOW TO DO THE MORE THINGS THAT I CAN BE HAPPY AND BUSY DOING WHEN MY BRAIN 'S NOT RUNNING THE SHOW ANYMORE
AlannaShaikh_2012G@261.13:275.25 THEY SAY THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES ARE HAPPIER EASIER FOR THEIR CAREGIVERS TO LOOK AFTER AND IT MAY EVEN SLOW THE PROGRESS OF THE DISEASE THAT ALL SEEMS LIKE WIN TO ME I WANT TO BE AS HAPPY AS I CAN FOR AS LONG AS I CAN
AlannaShaikh_2012G@276.24:282.55 A LOT OF PEOPLE DON 'T KNOW THAT ALZHEIMER 'S ACTUALLY HAS PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS AS WELL AS COGNITIVE SYMPTOMS
AlannaShaikh_2012G@282.94:286.15 YOU LOSE YOUR SENSE OF BALANCE YOU GET MUSCLE TREMORS
AlannaShaikh_2012G@286.19:292.65 AND THAT TENDS TO LEAD PEOPLE TO BEING LESS AND LESS MOBILE THEY GET SCARED TO WALK AROUND THEY GET SCARED TO MOVE
AlannaShaikh_2012G@292.66:302.42 SO I 'M DOING ACTIVITIES THAT WILL BUILD MY SENSE OF BALANCE I 'M DOING YOGA AND TAI CHI TO IMPROVE MY BALANCE SO THAT WHEN I START TO LOSE IT I 'LL STILL BE ABLE TO BE MOBILE
AlannaShaikh_2012G@302.46:310.69 I 'M DOING WEIGHT BEARING EXERCISE SO THAT I HAVE THE MUSCLE STRENGTH SO THAT WHEN I START TO WITHER I HAVE MORE TIME THAT I CAN STILL MOVE AROUND
AlannaShaikh_2012G@311.35:314.02 FINALLY THE THIRD THING
AlannaShaikh_2012G@316.61:320.96 MY DAD WAS KIND AND LOVING BEFORE HE HAD ALZHEIMER 'S AND HE 'S KIND AND LOVING NOW
AlannaShaikh_2012G@321.17:335.45 I 'VE SEEN HIM LOSE HIS INTELLECT HIS SENSE OF HUMOR HIS LANGUAGE SKILLS BUT I 'VE ALSO SEEN THIS HE LOVES ME HE LOVES MY SONS HE LOVES MY BROTHER AND MY MOM AND HIS CAREGIVERS
AlannaShaikh_2012G@335.58:345.58 AND THAT LOVE MAKES US WANT TO BE AROUND HIM EVEN NOW EVEN WHEN IT 'S SO HARD WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY EVERYTHING THAT HE EVER LEARNED IN THIS WORLD HIS NAKED HEART STILL SHINES
AlannaShaikh_2012G@345.87:358.41 I WAS NEVER AS KIND AS MY DAD AND I WAS NEVER AS LOVING AND WHAT I NEED NOW IS TO LEARN TO BE LIKE THAT I NEED A HEART SO PURE THAT IF IT 'S STRIPPED BARE BY DEMENTIA IT WILL SURVIVE
