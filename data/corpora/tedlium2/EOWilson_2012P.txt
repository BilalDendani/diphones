EOWilson_2012P@40.8:49.96 SO LET ME BEGIN BY URGING YOU PARTICULARLY YOU ON THE YOUNGSTERS SIDE ON THIS PATH YOU 'VE CHOSEN TO GO AS FAR AS YOU CAN
EOWilson_2012P@49.96:52.07 THE WORLD NEEDS YOU
EOWilson_2012P@52.07:57.72 BADLY HUMANITY IS NOW FULLY INTO THE TECHNO SCIENTIFIC AGE
EOWilson_2012P@57.72:60.59 THERE IS GOING TO BE NO TURNING BACK
EOWilson_2012P@75.28:82.8 TO PUBLIC HEALTH ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE IN MEDICAL SCIENCE AND SCIENCE OVERALL IS DOUBLING EVERY FIFTEEN
EOWilson_2012P@82.8:100.62 TO TWENTY YEARS TECHNOLOGY IS INCREASING AT A COMPARABLE RATE BETWEEN THEM THE TWO ALREADY PERVADE AS MOST OF YOU HERE SEATED REALIZE EVERY DIMENSION OF HUMAN LIFE SO SWIFT IS THE VELOCITY OF THE TECHNO SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION
EOWilson_2012P@132.06:136.13 TRADITIONAL FIELDS OF STUDY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW
EOWilson_2012P@146.58:161.65 AN EXPLANATION OF NETWORKS OF PRINCIPLES AND LAWS THAT 'S WHY YOU NEED NOT JUST BE TRAINING IN ONE SPECIALTY BUT ALSO ACQUIRE BREADTH IN OTHER FIELDS RELATED TO AND EVEN DISTANT FROM YOUR OWN INITIAL CHOICE
EOWilson_2012P@175.29:186.83 TO UNDERSTAND AND USE IT SANELY AS A PART OF THE CIVILIZATION YET TO EVOLVE REQUIRES A VASTLY LARGER POPULATION OF SCIENTIFICALLY TRAINED PEOPLE
EOWilson_2012P@234.97:244.34 IN MATHEMATICAL SKILLS DON 'T WORRY MANY OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SCIENTISTS AT WORK TODAY ARE MATHEMATICALLY SEMI LITERATE
EOWilson_2012P@244.34:247.54 A METAPHOR WILL SERVE HERE
EOWilson_2012P@263.82:280.88 INCLUDING A LARGE PORTION OF THOSE WHO COULD BE SAID TO BE OF THE FIRST RANK ARE THE ONES WHO MAP THE TERRAIN THEY SCOUT THE FRONTIERS THEY CUT THE PATHWAYS THEY RAISE THE BUILDINGS ALONG THE WAY SOME MAY HAVE CONSIDERED ME FOOLHARDY
EOWilson_2012P@286.48:303.06 DURING FORTY ONE YEARS OF TEACHING BIOLOGY AT HARVARD I WATCHED SADLY AS BRIGHT STUDENTS TURNED AWAY FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF A SCIENTIFIC CAREER OR EVEN FROM TAKING NON REQUIRED COURSES IN SCIENCE BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF FAILURE
EOWilson_2012P@346.53:349.89 TO BECOME AT LEAST SEMI LITERATE THE HARDER THE LANGUAGE
EOWilson_2012P@363.28:381.11 I DIDN 'T TAKE ALGEBRA UNTIL MY FRESHMAN YEAR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA THEY DIDN 'T TEACH IT BEFORE THEN I FINALLY GOT AROUND TO CALCULUS AS A THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD TENURED PROFESSOR AT HARVARD WHERE I SAT UNCOMFORTABLY IN CLASSES WITH UNDERGRADUATE
EOWilson_2012P@569.88:575.86 JUDGE OPPORTUNITY BY HOW FEW OTHER STUDENTS AND RESEARCHERS ARE ON HAND
EOWilson_2012P@575.86:583.51 THIS IS NOT TO DE EMPHASIZE THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT OF BROAD TRAINING OR THE VALUE OF APPRENTICING YOURSELF
EOWilson_2012P@583.51:600.83 IN ONGOING RESEARCH TO PROGRAMS OF HIGH QUALITY IT IS IMPORTANT ALSO TO ACQUIRE OLDER MENTORS WITHIN THESE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS AND TO MAKE FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES OF YOUR AGE FOR MUTUAL SUPPORT BUT THROUGH IT ALL LOOK FOR A WAY TO BREAK OUT
EOWilson_2012P@601.02:620.5 TO FIND A FIELD AND SUBJECT NOT YET POPULAR WE HAVE SEEN THIS DEMONSTRATED ALREADY IN THE TALKS PRECEDING MINE THERE IS THE QUICKEST WAY ADVANCES ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR AS MEASURED IN DISCOVERIES PER INVESTIGATOR PER YEAR YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THE MILITARY DICTUM
EOWilson_2012P@635.22:644.76 MARCH AWAY FROM THE SOUND OF THE GUNS OBSERVE FROM A DISTANCE BUT DO NOT JOIN THE FRAY MAKE A FRAY OF YOUR OWN
EOWilson_2012P@661.46:677.96 THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PROFESSIONALLY DELIMITED SUBJECTS SPRINKLED THROUGH PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY TO BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE AND ON THEN INTO THE SOCIAL SCIENCES WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE IN SHORT TIME TO ACQUIRE THE STATUS OF AN AUTHORITY
EOWilson_2012P@677.96:694.95 WHEN THE SUBJECT IS STILL VERY THINLY POPULATED YOU CAN WITH DILIGENCE AND HARD WORK BECOME THE WORLD AUTHORITY THE WORLD NEEDS THIS KIND OF EXPERTISE AND IT REWARDS THE KIND OF PEOPLE WILLING TO ACQUIRE IT
EOWilson_2012P@701.3:716.35 AND DIFFICULT TO CONNECT TO OTHER BODIES OF KNOWLEDGE WELL IF THAT 'S THE CASE GOOD WHY HARD INSTEAD OF EASY THE ANSWER DESERVES TO BE STATED AS PRINCIPLE NUMBER FOUR
EOWilson_2012P@716.35:736.08 IN THE ATTEMPT TO MAKE SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES EVERY PROBLEM IS AN OPPORTUNITY AND THE MORE DIFFICULT THE PROBLEM THE GREATER WILL BE THE IMPORTANCE OF ITS SOLUTION NOW THIS BRINGS ME TO A BASIC CATEGORIZATION IN THE WAY SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES ARE MADE SCIENTISTS PURE MATHEMATICIANS AMONG THEM
EOWilson_2012P@736.08:746.19 FOLLOW ONE OR THE OTHER OF TWO PATHWAYS FIRST THROUGH EARLY DISCOVERIES A PROBLEM IS IDENTIFIED AND A SOLUTION IS SOUGHT THE PROBLEM
EOWilson_2012P@819.3:827.12 CONVERSELY FOR EVERY SPECIES OR OTHER ENTITY OR PHENOMENON THERE EXIST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS
EOWilson_2012P@827.12:846.96 FOR THE SOLUTION OF WHICH THOSE PARTICULAR OBJECTS OF RESEARCH ARE IDEALLY SUITED FIND OUT WHAT THEY ARE YOU 'LL FIND YOUR OWN WAY TO DISCOVER TO LEARN TO TEACH THE DECADES AHEAD WILL SEE DRAMATIC ADVANCES IN DISEASE PREVENTION
EOWilson_2012P@846.96:853.48 GENERAL HEALTH THE QUALITY OF LIFE ALL OF HUMANITY DEPENDS ON THE KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE
EOWilson_2012P@853.48:869.64 OF THE MEDICINE AND THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT YOU WILL MASTER YOU HAVE CHOSEN A CALLING THAT WILL COME IN STEPS TO GIVE YOU SATISFACTION AT ITS CONCLUSION OF A LIFE WELL LIVED AND I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TONIGHT
