ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@17.94:24.84 I'VE COME HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU AN EXPERIMENT OF HOW TO GET RID OF ONE FORM OF HUMAN SUFFERING
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@71.65:83.20 AND THE IRONY IS THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO BE A SIMPLE WELL PROVEN SURGERY CAN RESTORE SIGHT TO MILLIONS AND SOMETHING EVEN SIMPLER A PAIR OF GLASSES CAN MAKE MILLIONS MORE SEE
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@83.77:90.96 IF WE ADD TO THAT THE MANY OF US HERE NOW WHO ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PAIR OF GLASSES THEN ALMOST
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@91.20:99.88 ONE IN FIVE INDIANS WILL REQUIRE EYE CARE A STAGGERING TWO HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE TODAY WE'RE REACHING NOT EVEN TEN PERCENT OF THEM
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@109.76:116.02 STARTED THIS WITH NO MONEY HE HAD TO MORTGAGE ALL HIS LIFE SAVINGS TO MAKE A BANK LOAN
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@116.54:123.07 AND OVER TIME WE HAVE GROWN INTO A NETWORK OF FIVE HOSPITALS PREDOMINATELY IN THE STATE OF TAMIL NADU AND
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@124.89:137.82 AND THEN WE ADDED SEVERAL WHAT WE CALL VISION CENTERS AS A HUB AND SPOKE MODEL AND THEN MORE RECENTLY WE STARTED MANAGING HOSPITALS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND ALSO SETTING UP HOSPITALS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@139.20:153.49 THE LAST THREE DECADES WE HAVE DONE ABOUT THREE AND A HALF MILLION SURGERIES A VAST MAJORITY OF THEM FOR THE POOR PEOPLE NOW EACH YEAR WE PERFORM ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SURGERIES
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@154.88:161.74 TYPICAL DAY AT ARAVIND WE WOULD DO ABOUT A THOUSAND SURGERIES MAYBE SEE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND PATIENTS
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@171.79:178.35 DO A LOT OF TRAINING BOTH FOR DOCTORS AND TECHNICIANS WHO WILL BECOME THE FUTURE STAFF OF
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@180.26:192.58 AND THEN DOING THIS DAY IN AND DAY OUT AND DOING IT WELL REQUIRES A LOT OF INSPIRATION AND A LOT OF HARD WORK AND I THINK THIS WAS POSSIBLE THANKS TO THE BUILDING BLOCKS PUT IN PLACE BY
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@193.04:200.54 DOCTOR V A VALUE SYSTEM AN EFFICIENT DELIVERY PROCESS AND FOSTERING THE CULTURE OF INNOVATION
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@220.88:226.69 A SOUL WHICH HAS GOT ALL THE SIMPLICITY OF CONFIDENCE DOCTOR WHATEVER YOU
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@227.99:235.87 AN IMPLICIT FAITH IN YOU AND THEN YOU RESPOND TO IT HERE IS AN OLD LADY WHO HAS GOT SO MUCH FAITH IN ME I MUST DO MY BEST FOR
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@243.45:243.71 SO
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@265.08:275.74 A VERY ETHICAL AND VERY HIGHLY PATIENT CENTRIC ORGANIZATION AND SYSTEMS THAT SUPPORT IT BUT ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL YOU ALSO HAVE TO DELIVER SERVICES EFFICIENTLY
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@277.76:278.20 AND
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@279.88:281.30 THE INSPIRATION CAME FROM
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@305.05:307.25 HE KEPT TALKING ABOUT MCDONALDS AND HAMBURGERS AND
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@314.03:319.38 HE WANTED TO CREATE A FRANCHISE A MECHANISM OF DELIVERY OF EYE CARE
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@320.20:322.16 WITH THE EFFICIENCY OF MCDONALD 'S
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@352.15:361.74 AND OF COURSE THE CHALLENGE WAS THAT IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM WE ARE TALKING OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE VERY LITTLE RESOURCE TO DEAL WITH IT AND THEN
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@362.14:375.10 LOTS OF LOGISTICS AND AFFORDABILITY ISSUES AND THEN SO ONE HAD TO CONSTANTLY INNOVATE AND ONE OF THE EARLY INNOVATIONS WHICH STILL CONTINUES IS TO CREATE OWNERSHIP IN THE COMMUNITY TO THE PROBLEM
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@375.64:384.22 AND THEN ENGAGE WITH THEM AS A PARTNER AND HERE IS ONE SUCH EVENT HERE A COMMUNITY CAMP JUST ORGANIZED BY THE
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@394.07:407.61 AND THEN YOU HAVE DOCTORS WHO YOU FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND THEN DETERMINE WHAT FURTHER TESTING SHOULD BE DONE AND THEN THOSE TESTS ARE DONE BY TECHNICIANS WHO CHECK FOR GLASSES
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@410.13:410.64 OR
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@420.34:428.08 AND IF THEY NEED A PAIR OF GLASSES THEY ARE AVAILABLE RIGHT THERE AT THE CAMP SITE USUALLY UNDER A TREE BUT THEY GET GLASSES
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@428.60:436.76 IN THE FRAMES OF THEIR CHOICE AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK GLASSES IN ADDITION TO HELPING PEOPLE SEE IS ALSO A FASHION STATEMENT AND THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@442.30:456.28 SO THEY GET IT IN ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES AND THOSE WHO REQUIRE SURGERY ARE COUNSELED AND THEN THERE ARE BUSES WAITING WHICH WILL TRANSPORT THEM TO THE BASE HOSPITAL AND IF IT WAS NOT FOR THIS
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@457.75:468.68 KIND OF LOGISTICS AND SUPPORT MANY PEOPLE LIKE THIS WOULD PROBABLY NEVER GET SERVICES AND CERTAINLY NOT WHEN THEY MOST NEED IT THEY RECEIVE SURGERY THE FOLLOWING DAY
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@470.73:482.17 AND THEN THEY WILL STAY FOR A DAY OR TWO AND THEN THEY ARE PUT BACK ON THE BUSES TO BE TAKEN BACK TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM AND WHERE THEIR FAMILIES WILL BE WAITING TO TAKE THEM BACK HOME
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@503.51:512.38 DID A STUDY A SCIENTIFICALLY DESIGNED PROCESS AND THEN TO OUR DISMAY WE FOUND THIS WAS ONLY REACHING SEVEN PERCENT OF THOSE IN NEED
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@512.79:519.29 AND WE'RE NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESSING MORE BIGGER PROBLEMS SO WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT SO WE SET UP WHAT
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@520.98:529.31 PRIMARY EYE CARE CENTERS VISION CENTERS THESE ARE TRULY PAPERLESS OFFICES WITH COMPLETELY ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS AND SO ON
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@542.20:552.94 THE EFFECT OF THIS HAS BEEN THAT WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR WE REALLY HAD A FORTY PERCENT PENETRATION IN THE MARKET THAT IT SERVED WHICH IS OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@585.83:591.64 WAS HOW DO YOU GIVE HIGH TECH OR MORE ADVANCED TREATMENT AND CARE WE DESIGNED A VAN WITH
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@594.59:603.72 SENDS OUT IMAGES OF PATIENTS TO THE BASE HOSPITAL WHERE IT IS DIAGNOSED AND THEN AS THE PATIENT IS WAITING THE REPORT GOES BACK TO THE PATIENT
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@604.48:618.15 IT GETS PRINTED OUT THE PATIENT GETS IT AND THEN GETS A CONSULTATION ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING I MEAN GO SEE A DOCTOR OR COME BACK AFTER SIX MONTHS AND THEN THIS HAPPENS AS A WAY OF BRIDGING THE TECHNOLOGY COMPETENCE
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@620.49:632.13 SO THE IMPACT OF ALL THIS HAS BEEN ESSENTIALLY ONE OF GROWING THE MARKET BECAUSE IT FOCUSED ON THE NON CUSTOMER AND THEN BY REACHING THE UNREACHED WE'RE ABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY GROW THE MARKET
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@633.34:640.49 THE OTHER ASPECT IS HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THIS EFFICIENTLY WHEN YOU HAVE VERY FEW OPHTHALMOLOGISTS SO WHAT IS IN THIS VIDEO
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@641.35:648.42 A SURGEON OPERATING AND THEN YOU SEE ON THE OTHER SIDE ANOTHER PATIENT IS GETTING READY SO AS THEY FINISH
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@650.01:656.16 THEY JUST SWING THE MICROSCOPE OVER THE TABLES ARE PLACED SO THAT THEIR DISTANCE IS JUST RIGHT
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@656.59:664.28 AND THEN WE NEED TO DO THIS BECAUSE BY DOING THIS KIND OF PROCESS WE'RE ABLE TO MORE THAN QUADRUPLE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE SURGEON
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@677.59:688.70 ALMOST ALL OF THE SKILL BASED ROUTINE TASKS THEY DO ONE THING AT A TIME THEY DO IT EXTREMELY WELL WITH THE RESULT WE HAVE VERY HIGH PRODUCTIVITY VERY HIGH QUALITY AT VERY VERY LOW COST
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@691.52:696.46 SO PUTTING ALL THIS TOGETHER WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WAS THE PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR STAFF
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@697.07:699.85 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN ANYONE
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@706.88:715.27 THIS IS A VERY BUSY TABLE BUT WHAT THIS REALLY IS CONVEYING IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO QUALITY WE HAVE PUT IN VERY GOOD QUALITY ASSURANCE SYSTEMS
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@726.95:737.80 SO THE FINAL PART OF THE PUZZLE IS HOW DO YOU MAKE ALL THIS WORK FINANCIALLY ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PEOPLE CAN'T PAY FOR IT SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE GAVE AWAY A LOT OF IT FOR FREE
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@738.42:747.23 AND THEN THOSE WHO PAY I MEAN THEY PAID LOCAL MARKET RATES NOTHING MORE AND OFTEN MUCH LESS AND WE WERE HELPED BY THE MARKET INEFFICIENCY I THINK THAT HAS BEEN A BIG
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@747.67:754.82 SAVIOR EVEN NOW AND OF COURSE ONE NEEDS THE MINDSET TO BE WANTING TO GIVE AWAY WHAT YOU HAVE
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@757.24:767.77 BEEN OVER THE YEARS THE EXPENDITURE HAS INCREASED WITH VOLUMES THE REVENUES INCREASE AT A HIGHER LEVEL GIVING US A HEALTHY MARGIN WHILE YOU'RE TREATING A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FOR FREE
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@768.17:777.03 I THINK IN ABSOLUTE TERMS LAST YEAR WE EARNED ABOUT TWENTY ODD MILLION DOLLARS SPENT ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION WITH OVER A FORTY PERCENT
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@786.76:799.02 THIS REALLY REQUIRES GOING BEYOND WHAT WE DO OR WHAT WE HAVE DONE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO ACHIEVE SOLVING THIS PROBLEM OF BLINDNESS AND WHAT WE DID WAS A COUPLE OF VERY COUNTER INTUITIVE THINGS
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@819.17:831.35 THE IMPACT OF THIS HAS BEEN THAT THESE HOSPITALS IN THE SECOND YEAR AFTER OUR CONSULTATION ARE DOUBLE THEIR OUTPUT AND THEN ACHIEVE FINANCIAL RECOVERY AS
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@833.22:833.84 THE
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@837.53:848.40 THIS INCREASE IN COST OF TECHNOLOGY THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE FAILED TO NEGOTIATE THE PRICES TO BE AT AFFORDABLE LEVELS SO WE SET UP A MANUFACTURING UNIT
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@849.67:856.09 AND THEN OVER TIME WE WERE ABLE TO BRING DOWN THE COST SIGNIFICANTLY TO ABOUT TWO PERCENT OF WHAT IT USED TO BE
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@868.87:879.30 WHAT WE DO DOES IT HAVE A BROADER RELEVANCE OR IS IT JUST INDIA OR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SO TO ADDRESS THIS WE STUDIED
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@883.57:895.08 WHAT IT SHOWS IS THAT WE DO ROUGHLY ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF THE VOLUME OF WHAT THE UK DOES NEAR A HALF MILLION SURGERIES AS A WHOLE COUNTRY AND WE DO ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@895.71:908.23 AND THEN WE TRAIN ABOUT FIFTY OPHTHALMOLOGISTS AGAINST THE SEVENTY TRAINED BY THEM COMPARABLE QUALITY BOTH IN TRAINING AND IN PATIENT CARE SO WE'RE REALLY COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES WE LOOKED AT COST
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@929.88:942.75 THE SOLUTION TO THE COST COULD BE IN PRODUCTIVITY MAYBE IN EFFICIENCY IN THE CLINICAL PROCESS OR IN HOW MUCH THEY PAY FOR THE LENSES OR CONSUMABLES OR REGULATIONS THEIR DEFENSIVE PRACTICE
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@943.11:954.98 SO I THINK DECODING THIS CAN PROBABLY BRING ANSWERS TO MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE U S AND MAYBE OBAMA 'S RATINGS CAN GO UP AGAIN
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@971.41:979.74 I THINK THE PROCESS I DESCRIBED YOU KNOW PRODUCTIVITY QUALITY PATIENT CENTERED CARE CAN GIVE AN ANSWER
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@994.96:1005.92 NOW HOW DO YOU MAKE PEOPLE OWN THE PROBLEM WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THERE ARE A BIT HARDER ISSUES AND I'M SURE PEOPLE IN THIS CROWD CAN PROBABLY FIND THE SOLUTIONS TO THESE SO I WANT TO END MY TALK
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I@1011.87:1014.03 ALL THAT IS IN THE WORLD SO
