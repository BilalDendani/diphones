JaneMcGonigal_2010@15.476:31.85 I 'M JANE MCGONIGAL I 'M A GAME DESIGNER I 'VE BEEN MAKING GAMES ONLINE NOW FOR TEN YEARS AND MY GOAL FOR THE NEXT DECADE IS TO TRY TO MAKE IT AS EASY TO SAVE THE WORLD IN REAL LIFE AS IT IS TO SAVE THE WORLD IN ONLINE GAMES
JaneMcGonigal_2010@31.85:39.53 NOW I HAVE A PLAN FOR THIS AND IT ENTAILS CONVINCING MORE PEOPLE INCLUDING ALL OF YOU TO SPEND MORE TIME
JaneMcGonigal_2010@39.53:48.22 PLAYING BIGGER AND BETTER GAMES RIGHT NOW WE SPEND THREE BILLION HOURS A WEEK PLAYING ONLINE GAMES SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE THINKING
JaneMcGonigal_2010@48.22:62 THAT 'S A LOT OF TIME TO SPEND PLAYING GAMES MAYBE TOO MUCH TIME CONSIDERING HOW MANY URGENT PROBLEMS WE HAVE TO SOLVE IN THE REAL WORLD BUT ACTUALLY ACCORDING TO MY RESEARCH AT THE INSTITUTE FOR THE FUTURE IT 'S ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@62:69.01 THREE BILLION HOURS A WEEK IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH GAME PLAY TO SOLVE THE WORLD 'S MOST URGENT PROBLEMS IN FACT
JaneMcGonigal_2010@69.01:80.15 I BELIEVE THAT IF WE WANT TO SURVIVE THE NEXT CENTURY ON THIS PLANET WE NEED TO INCREASE THAT TOTAL DRAMATICALLY I 'VE CALCULATED THE TOTAL WE NEED AT TWENTY ONE BILLION HOURS OF GAME PLAY EVERY WEEK
JaneMcGonigal_2010@80.15:91.35 SO THAT 'S PROBABLY A BIT OF A COUNTERINTUITIVE IDEA SO I 'LL JUST I 'LL SAY IT AGAIN LET IT SINK IN IF WE WANT TO SOLVE PROBLEMS LIKE HUNGER POVERTY CLIMATE CHANGE GLOBAL CONFLICT OBESITY
JaneMcGonigal_2010@91.35:99.39 I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO ASPIRE TO PLAY GAMES ONLINE FOR AT LEAST TWENTY ONE BILLION HOURS A WEEK BY THE END OF THE NEXT DECADE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@99.39:101.224 NO I 'M SERIOUS
JaneMcGonigal_2010@101.224:110.672 I AM HERE IS WHY THIS PICTURE PRETTY MUCH SUMS UP WHY I THINK GAMES ARE SO ESSENTIAL TO THE FUTURE SURVIVAL OF THE HUMAN SPECIES TRULY
JaneMcGonigal_2010@110.672:120.9 THIS IS A PORTRAIT BY A PHOTOGRAPHER NAMED PHIL TOLEDANO HE WANTED TO CAPTURE THE EMOTION OF GAMING SO HE SET UP A CAMERA IN FRONT OF GAMERS WHILE THEY WERE PLAYING AND THIS IS A CLASSIC
JaneMcGonigal_2010@120.9:129.98 GAMING EMOTION NOW IF YOU 'RE NOT A GAMER YOU MIGHT MISS SOME OF THE NUANCE IN THIS PHOTO YOU PROBABLY SEE THE SENSE OF URGENCY A LITTLE BIT OF
JaneMcGonigal_2010@129.98:151.534 FEAR BUT INTENSE CONCENTRATION DEEP DEEP FOCUS ON TACKLING A REALLY DIFFICULT PROBLEM IF YOU ARE A GAMER YOU WILL NOTICE A FEW NUANCES HERE THE CRINKLE OF THE EYES UP AND AROUND THE MOUTH IS A SIGN OF OPTIMISM AND THE EYEBROWS UP IS SURPRISE THIS IS A GAMER WHO IS ON THE VERGE OF SOMETHING CALLED AN EPIC WIN NOW
JaneMcGonigal_2010@151.534:152.678 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
JaneMcGonigal_2010@152.678:167 OH YOU 'VE HEARD OF THAT OKAY GOOD SO WE HAVE SOME GAMERS AMONG US SO AN EPIC WIN IS AN OUTCOME THAT IS SO EXTRAORDINARILY POSITIVE YOU HAD NO IDEA IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE UNTIL YOU ACHIEVED IT IT WAS ALMOST BEYOND THE THRESHOLD OF IMAGINATION
JaneMcGonigal_2010@167:171.59 AND WHEN YOU GET THERE YOU ARE SHOCKED TO DISCOVER WHAT YOU ARE TRULY CAPABLE OF THAT 'S AN EPIC WIN
JaneMcGonigal_2010@171.59:183.74 THIS IS A GAMER ON THE VERGE OF AN EPIC WIN AND THIS IS THE FACE THAT WE NEED TO SEE ON MILLIONS OF PROBLEM SOLVERS ALL OVER THE WORLD AS WE TRY TO TACKLE THE OBSTACLES OF THE NEXT CENTURY THE FACE OF SOMEONE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@183.74:196.922 WHO AGAINST ALL ODDS IS ON THE VERGE OF AN EPIC WIN NOW UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS MORE OF THE FACE THAT WE SEE IN EVERYDAY LIFE NOW AS WE TRY TO TACKLE URGENT PROBLEMS THIS IS WHAT I CALL THE I 'M NOT GOOD AT LIFE FACE AND THIS IS ACTUALLY ME
JaneMcGonigal_2010@196.922:229.47 MAKING IT CAN YOU SEE YES GOOD THIS IS ACTUALLY ME MAKING THE I 'M NOT GOOD AT LIFE FACE THIS IS A PIECE OF GRAFFITI IN MY OLD NEIGHBORHOOD IN BERKELEY CALIFORNIA WHERE I DID MY PHD ON WHY WE 'RE BETTER IN GAMES THAN WE ARE IN REAL LIFE AND THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT A LOT OF GAMERS HAVE WE FEEL THAT WE ARE NOT AS GOOD IN REALITY AS WE ARE IN GAMES AND I DON 'T MEAN JUST GOOD AS IN SUCCESSFUL ALTHOUGH THAT 'S PART OF IT WE DO ACHIEVE MORE IN GAME WORLDS BUT I ALSO MEAN GOOD AS IN MOTIVATED TO DO SOMETHING THAT MATTERS INSPIRED TO COLLABORATE AND TO COOPERATE AND WHEN WE 'RE IN GAME WORLDS
JaneMcGonigal_2010@229.47:241.37 I BELIEVE THAT MANY OF US BECOME THE BEST VERSION OF OURSELVES THE MOST LIKELY TO HELP AT A MOMENT 'S NOTICE THE MOST LIKELY TO STICK WITH A PROBLEM AS LONG AT IT TAKES TO GET UP AFTER FAILURE AND TRY AGAIN AND IN REAL LIFE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@241.37:252.75 WHEN WE WHEN WE FACE FAILURE WHEN WE CONFRONT OBSTACLES WE OFTEN DON 'T FEEL THAT WAY WE FEEL OVERCOME WE FEEL OVERWHELMED WE FEEL ANXIOUS MAYBE DEPRESSED FRUSTRATED OR CYNICAL
JaneMcGonigal_2010@252.75:265.62 WE NEVER HAVE THOSE FEELINGS WHEN WE 'RE PLAYING GAMES THEY JUST DON 'T EXIST IN GAMES SO THAT 'S WHAT I WANTED TO STUDY WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT WHAT ABOUT GAMES MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FEEL THAT WE CAN 'T ACHIEVE EVERYTHING HOW CAN WE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@265.62:277.37 TAKE THOSE FEELINGS FROM GAMES AND APPLY THEM TO REAL WORLD WORK SO I LOOKED AT GAMES LIKE WORLD OF WARCRAFT WHICH IS REALLY THE IDEAL COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING ENVIRONMENT AND I STARTED TO NOTICE A FEW THINGS THAT MAKE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@277.37:290.44 EPIC WINS SO POSSIBLE IN ONLINE WORLDS SO THE FIRST THING IS WHENEVER YOU SHOW UP IN ONE OF THESE ONLINE GAMES ESPECIALLY IN WORLD OF WARCRAFT THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT CHARACTERS WHO ARE WILLING TO TRUST YOU WITH A WORLD SAVING MISSION
JaneMcGonigal_2010@290.44:300.73 RIGHT AWAY BUT NOT JUST ANY MISSION IT 'S A MISSION THAT IS PERFECTLY MATCHED WITH YOUR CURRENT LEVEL IN THE GAME RIGHT SO YOU CAN DO IT THEY NEVER GIVE YOU A CHALLENGE THAT YOU CAN 'T ACHIEVE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@300.73:309.93 BUT IT IS ON THE THE VERGE OF WHAT YOU 'RE CAPABLE OF SO YOU HAVE TO TRY HARD BUT THERE IS NO UNEMPLOYMENT IN WORLD OF WARCRAFT THERE IS NO SITTING AROUND WRINGING YOUR HANDS THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING SPECIFIC
JaneMcGonigal_2010@309.93:316 AND IMPORTANT TO BE DONE AND THERE ARE ALSO TONS OF COLLABORATORS EVERYWHERE YOU GO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@316:328.644 READY TO WORK WITH YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR EPIC MISSION IT 'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE IN REAL LIFE THAT EASILY THIS SENSE THAT AT OUR FINGERTIPS ARE TONS OF COLLABORATORS AND ALSO THERE IS THIS EPIC STORY THIS INSPIRING STORY OF WHY WE 'RE THERE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@328.644:342.88 AND WHAT WE 'RE DOING AND THEN WE GET ALL THIS POSITIVE FEEDBACK YOU GUYS HAVE HEARD OF LEVELING UP AND PLUS ONE STRENGTH AND PLUS ONE INTELLIGENCE WE DON 'T GET THAT KIND OF CONSTANT FEEDBACK IN REAL LIFE WHEN I GET OFF THIS STAGE I 'M NOT GOING TO HAVE PLUS ONE SPEAKING AND PLUS ONE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@342.88:352.86 CRAZY IDEA PLUS TWENTY CRAZY IDEA I DON 'T GET THAT FEEDBACK IN REAL LIFE NOW THE PROBLEM WITH COLLABORATIVE ONLINE ENVIRONMENTS LIKE WORLD OF WARCRAFT
JaneMcGonigal_2010@352.86:371.75 IS THAT IT 'S SO SATISFYING TO BE ON THE VERGE OF AN EPIC WIN ALL THE TIME THAT WE DECIDE TO SPEND ALL OUR TIME IN THESE GAME WORLDS IT 'S JUST BETTER THAN REALITY SO SO FAR COLLECTIVELY ALL THE WORLD OF WARCRAFT GAMERS HAVE SPENT FIVE POINT NINE THREE MILLION YEARS SOLVING THE VIRTUAL PROBLEMS OF AZEROTH NOW
JaneMcGonigal_2010@371.75:379.95 THAT 'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE IT 'S A BAD THING BUT TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT FIVE POINT NINE THREE MILLION YEARS AGO WAS WHEN
JaneMcGonigal_2010@379.95:391.67 OUR EARLIEST PRIMATE HUMAN ANCESTORS STOOD UP THAT WAS THE FIRST UPRIGHT PRIMATE OKAY SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH TIME WE 'RE CURRENTLY INVESTING IN PLAYING GAMES
JaneMcGonigal_2010@391.67:406.09 THE ONLY WAY IT MAKES SENSE TO EVEN THINK ABOUT IT IS TO TALK ABOUT TIME AT THE MAGNITUDE OF HUMAN EVOLUTION WHICH IS AN EXTRAORDINARY THING BUT IT 'S ALSO APT BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT BY SPENDING ALL THIS TIME PLAYING GAMES WE ARE ACTUALLY CHANGING
JaneMcGonigal_2010@406.09:416.25 WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF AS HUMAN BEINGS WE ARE EVOLVING TO BE A MORE COLLABORATIVE AND HEARTY SPECIES THIS IS TRUE I BELIEVE THIS SO CONSIDER THIS REALLY INTERESTING STATISTIC
JaneMcGonigal_2010@416.25:424.27 IT WAS RECENTLY PUBLISHED BY A RESEARCHER AT CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY THE AVERAGE YOUNG PERSON TODAY IN A COUNTRY WITH A STRONG GAMER CULTURE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@424.27:434.61 WILL HAVE SPENT TEN THOUSAND HOURS PLAYING ONLINE GAMES BY THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE NOW TEN THOUSAND HOURS IS A REALLY INTERESTING NUMBER FOR TWO REASONS FIRST OF ALL
JaneMcGonigal_2010@434.61:446.23 FOR CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES TEN THOUSAND AND EIGHTY HOURS IS THE EXACT AMOUNT OF TIME YOU WILL SPEND IN SCHOOL FROM FIFTH GRADE TO HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION IF YOU HAVE PERFECT ATTENDANCE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@446.23:456.42 SO WE HAVE AN ENTIRE PARALLEL TRACK OF EDUCATION GOING ON WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE LEARNING AS MUCH ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A GOOD GAMER AS THEY ARE LEARNING ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE IN SCHOOL
JaneMcGonigal_2010@456.42:469.31 AND SOME OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY READ MALCOM GLADWELL 'S NEW BOOK OUTLIERS SO YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD OF HIS THEORY OF SUCCESS THE TEN THOUSAND HOUR THEORY OF SUCCESS IT 'S BASED ON THIS GREAT COGNITIVE SCIENCE RESEARCH THAT IF WE CAN MASTER
JaneMcGonigal_2010@469.31:480.34 TEN THOUSAND HOURS AT EFFORTFUL STUDY AT ANYTHING BY THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE WE WILL BE VIRTUOSOS AT IT WE WILL BE AS GOOD AT WHATEVER WE DO AS THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND SO
JaneMcGonigal_2010@480.34:488.91 NOW WHAT WE 'RE LOOKING AT IS AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE VIRTUOSO GAMERS SO THE BIG QUESTION IS
JaneMcGonigal_2010@488.91:498.85 WHAT EXACTLY ARE GAMERS GETTING SO GOOD AT BECAUSE IF WE COULD FIGURE THAT OUT WE WOULD HAVE A VIRTUALLY UNPRECEDENTED HUMAN RESOURCE ON OUR HANDS
JaneMcGonigal_2010@498.85:510.44 THIS IS HOW MANY PEOPLE WE NOW HAVE IN THE WORLD WHO SPEND AT LEAST AN HOUR A DAY PLAYING ONLINE GAMES THESE ARE OUR VIRTUOSO GAMERS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD AT SOMETHING
JaneMcGonigal_2010@510.44:515.9 AND IN THE NEXT DECADE WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER BILLION GAMERS WHO ARE EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD
JaneMcGonigal_2010@515.9:529.84 AT WHATEVER THAT IS IF YOU DON 'T KNOW IT ALREADY THIS IS COMING THE GAME INDUSTRY IS DEVELOPING CONSOLES THAT ARE LOW ENERGY AND THAT WORK WITH THE WIRELESS PHONE NETWORKS INSTEAD OF BROADBAND INTERNET SO THAT GAMERS ALL OVER THE WORLD PARTICULARLY IN INDIA
JaneMcGonigal_2010@529.84:536.72 CHINA BRAZIL CAN GET ONLINE THEY EXPECT ONE BILLION MORE GAMERS IN THE NEXT DECADE IT WILL BRING US UP TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION GAMERS
JaneMcGonigal_2010@536.72:542.61 SO I 'VE STARTED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THESE GAMES ARE MAKING US VIRTUOSOS AT HERE ARE THE FOUR THINGS I CAME UP WITH
JaneMcGonigal_2010@542.61:556.64 THE FIRST IS URGENT OPTIMISM OKAY THINK OF THIS AS EXTREME SELF MOTIVATION URGENT OPTIMISM IS THE DESIRE TO ACT IMMEDIATELY TO TACKLE AN OBSTACLE COMBINED WITH THE BELIEF THAT WE HAVE A REASONABLE HOPE OF SUCCESS
JaneMcGonigal_2010@556.64:563.73 GAMERS ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT AN EPIC WIN IS POSSIBLE AND THAT IT IS ALWAYS WORTH TRYING AND TRYING NOW GAMERS DON 'T SIT AROUND
JaneMcGonigal_2010@563.73:574.63 OK GAMERS ARE VIRTUOSOS AT WEAVING A TIGHT SOCIAL FABRIC THERE IS A LOT OF INTERESTING RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT WE LIKE PEOPLE BETTER AFTER WE PLAY A GAME WITH THEM EVEN IF THEY 'VE BEATEN US BADLY
JaneMcGonigal_2010@574.63:594.25 AND THE REASON IS IT TAKES A LOT OF TRUST TO PLAY A GAME WITH SOMEONE WE TRUST THAT THEY WILL SPEND THEIR TIME WITH US THAT THEY WILL PLAY BY THE SAME RULES VALUE THE SAME GOAL THEY 'LL STAY WITH THE GAME UNTIL IT 'S OVER AND SO PLAYING A GAME TOGETHER ACTUALLY BUILDS UP BONDS AND TRUST AND COOPERATION AND AND WE ACTUALLY BUILD STRONGER SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AS A RESULT
JaneMcGonigal_2010@594.25:607.96 BLISSFUL PRODUCTIVITY I LOVE IT YOU KNOW THERE IS A REASON WHY THE AVERAGE WORLD OF WARCRAFT GAMER PLAYS FOR TWENTY TWO HOURS A WEEK KIND OF A HALF TIME JOB IT 'S BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN WE 'RE PLAYING A GAME THAT WE 'RE ACTUALLY HAPPIER WORKING HARD THAN WE ARE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@607.96:620.73 RELAXING OR HANGING OUT WE KNOW THAT WE ARE OPTIMIZED AS HUMAN BEINGS TO DO HARD AND MEANINGFUL WORK AND GAMERS ARE WILLING TO WORK HARD ALL THE TIME IF THEY 'RE GIVEN THE RIGHT WORK FINALLY EPIC MEANING
JaneMcGonigal_2010@620.73:634.91 GAMERS LOVE TO BE ATTACHED TO AWE INSPIRING MISSIONS TO HUMAN PLANETARY SCALE STORIES SO JUST ONE BIT OF TRIVIA THAT HELPS PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE SO YOU ALL KNOW WIKIPEDIA
JaneMcGonigal_2010@634.91:642.12 BIGGEST WIKI IN THE WORLD SECOND BIGGEST WIKI IN THE WORLD WITH NEARLY EIGHTY THOUSAND ARTICLES IS THE WORLD OF WARCRAFT WIKI
JaneMcGonigal_2010@642.12:659.79 FIVE MILLION PEOPLE USE IT EVERY MONTH THEY HAVE COMPILED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WORLD OF WARCRAFT ON THE INTERNET THAN ANY OTHER TOPIC COVERED ON ANY OTHER WIKI IN THE WORLD THEY ARE BUILDING AN EPIC STORY THEY ARE BUILDING EPIC KNOWLEDGE RESOURCE ABOUT THE WORLD OF WARCRAFT OKAY SO THESE ARE FOUR SUPERPOWERS THAT ADD UP
JaneMcGonigal_2010@659.79:666.02 TO ONE THING GAMERS ARE SUPER EMPOWERED HOPEFUL INDIVIDUALS
JaneMcGonigal_2010@666.02:679.35 THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE INDIVIDUALLY CAPABLE OF CHANGING THE WORLD AND THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF CHANGING VIRTUAL WORLDS AND NOT THE REAL WORLD THAT 'S THE PROBLEM THAT I 'M TRYING TO SOLVE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@679.35:688.38 THERE IS AN ECONOMIST NAMED EDWARD CASTRONOVA HIS WORK IS BRILLIANT HE LOOKS AT WHY PEOPLE ARE INVESTING SO MUCH TIME AND ENERGY AND MONEY IN ONLINE WORLDS
JaneMcGonigal_2010@688.38:698.65 AND HE SAYS WE 'RE WITNESSING WHAT AMOUNTS TO NO LESS THAN A MASS EXODUS TO VIRTUAL WORLDS AND ONLINE GAME ENVIRONMENTS AND HE 'S AN ECONOMIST SO HE 'S RATIONAL AND HE SAYS
JaneMcGonigal_2010@698.65:700.76 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
JaneMcGonigal_2010@700.76:705.4 NOT LIKE ME I 'M A GAME DESIGNER I 'M EXUBERANT BUT HE SAYS HE SAYS
JaneMcGonigal_2010@705.4:719.59 THAT THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE BECAUSE GAMERS CAN ACHIEVE MORE IN ONLINE WORLDS THAN THEY CAN IN REAL LIFE THEY CAN HAVE STRONGER SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS IN GAMES THAN THEY CAN HAVE IN REAL LIFE THEY GET BETTER FEEDBACK AND FEEL MORE REWARDED IN GAMES THAN THEY DO IN REAL LIFE SO HE SAYS
JaneMcGonigal_2010@719.59:725.39 FOR NOW IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE FOR GAMERS TO SPEND MORE TIME IN VIRTUAL WORLDS THAN THE REAL WORLD NOW
JaneMcGonigal_2010@725.39:737.42 I ALSO AGREE THAT THAT IS RATIONAL FOR NOW BUT IT IS NOT BY ANY MEANS AN OPTIMAL SITUATION WE HAVE TO START MAKING THE REAL WORLD WORK MORE LIKE A GAME SO I TAKE MY INSPIRATION FROM SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED
JaneMcGonigal_2010@737.42:751.83 TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THESE ARE ANCIENT DICE MADE OUT OF SHEEP 'S KNUCKLES RIGHT BEFORE WE HAD AWESOME GAME CONTROLERS WE HAD SHEEP 'S KNUCKLES AND THESE REPRESENT THE FIRST GAME EQUIPMENT DESIGNED BY HUMAN BEINGS
JaneMcGonigal_2010@751.83:760.51 AND IF YOU 'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE WORK OF THE ANCIENT GREEK HISTORIAN HERODOTUS YOU MIGHT KNOW THIS HISTORY WHICH IS THE HISTORY OF WHO INVENTED GAMES AND WHY
JaneMcGonigal_2010@760.51:770.7 HERODOTUS SAYS THAT GAMES PARTICULARLY DICE GAMES WERE INVENTED IN THE KINGDOM OF LYDIA DURING A TIME OF FAMINE APPARENTLY THERE WAS SUCH A SEVERE FAMINE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@770.7:779.89 THAT THE KING OF LYDIA DECIDED THAT THEY HAD TO DO SOMETHING CRAZY PEOPLE WERE SUFFERING PEOPLE WERE FIGHTING IT WAS AN EXTREME SITUATION THEY NEEDED AN EXTREME SOLUTION
JaneMcGonigal_2010@779.89:786.05 SO ACCORDING TO HERODOTUS THEY INVENTED DICE GAMES AND THEY SET UP A KINGDOM WIDE POLICY
JaneMcGonigal_2010@786.05:798.41 ON ONE DAY EVERYBODY WOULD EAT AND ON THE NEXT DAY EVERYBODY WOULD PLAY GAMES AND THEY WOULD BE SO IMMERSED IN PLAYING THE DICE GAMES BECAUSE GAMES ARE SO ENGAGING AND IMMERSE US IN SUCH SATISFYING BLISSFUL PRODUCTIVITY
JaneMcGonigal_2010@798.41:807.08 THEY WOULD IGNORE THE FACT THAT THEY HAD NO FOOD TO EAT AND THEN ON THE NEXT DAY THEY WOULD PLAY GAMES AND ON THE NEXT DAY THEY WOULD EAT AND ACCORDING TO HERODOTUS
JaneMcGonigal_2010@807.08:817.59 THEY PASSED EIGHTEEN YEARS THIS WAY SURVIVING THROUGH A FAMINE BY EATING ON ONE DAY AND PLAYING GAMES ON THE NEXT NOW THIS IS EXACTLY I THINK HOW WE 'RE USING GAMES TODAY
JaneMcGonigal_2010@817.59:827.34 WE 'RE USING GAMES TO ESCAPE REAL WORLD SUFFERING WE 'RE USING GAMES TO GET AWAY FROM EVERYTHING THAT 'S BROKEN IN THE REAL ENVIRONMENT EVERYTHING THAT 'S NOT SATISFYING ABOUT REAL LIFE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@827.34:842.16 AND WE 'RE GETTING WHAT WE NEED FROM GAMES BUT IT DOESN 'T HAVE TO END THERE THIS IS REALLY EXCITING ACCORDING TO HERODOTUS AFTER EIGHTEEN YEARS THE FAMINE WASN 'T GETTING BETTER SO THE KING DECIDED THEY WOULD PLAY ONE FINAL DICE GAME
JaneMcGonigal_2010@842.16:849.25 THEY DIVIDED THE ENTIRE KINGDOM IN HALF THEY PLAYED ONE DICE GAME AND THE WINNERS OF THAT GAME GOT TO GO
JaneMcGonigal_2010@849.25:857.44 ON AN EPIC ADVENTURE THEY WOULD LEAVE LYDIA AND THEY WOULD GO OUT IN SEARCH OF A NEW PLACE TO LIVE LEAVING BEHIND JUST ENOUGH PEOPLE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@857.44:865.51 TO SURVIVE ON THE RESOURCES THAT WERE AVAILABLE AND HOPEFULLY TO TAKE THE CIVILIZATION SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE THEY COULD THRIVE NOW THIS SOUNDS CRAZY RIGHT
JaneMcGonigal_2010@865.51:875.44 BUT RECENTLY DNA EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN THAT THE ETRUSCANS WHO LEAD TO THE ROMAN EMPIRE ACTUALLY SHARE THE SAME DNA AS THE ANCIENT LYDIANS AND SO
JaneMcGonigal_2010@875.44:890.09 RECENTLY SCIENTISTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT HERODOTUS 'S CRAZY STORY IS ACTUALLY TRUE AND GEOLOGISTS HAVE FOUND EVIDENCE OF A GLOBAL COOLING THAT LASTED FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS THAT COULD HAVE EXPLAINED THE FAMINE SO THIS CRAZY STORY MIGHT BE TRUE THEY MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY
JaneMcGonigal_2010@890.09:903.06 SAVED THEIR CULTURE BY PLAYING GAMES ESCAPING TO GAMES FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS AND THEN BEEN SO INSPIRED AND AND KNEW SO MUCH ABOUT HOW TO COME TOGETHER WITH GAMES THAT THEY ACTUALLY SAVED THE ENTIRE CIVILIZATION THAT WAY OKAY WE CAN DO THAT
JaneMcGonigal_2010@903.06:911.4 WE 'VE BEEN PLAYING WARCRAFT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THAT WAS THE FIRST REAL TIME STRATEGY GAME FROM THE WORLD OF WARCRAFT SERIES THAT WAS SIXTEEN YEARS AGO
JaneMcGonigal_2010@911.4:919.22 THEY PLAYED DICE GAMES FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS WE 'VE BEEN PLAYING WARCRAFT FOR SIXTEEN YEARS I SAY WE ARE READY FOR OUR OWN EPIC GAME NOW
JaneMcGonigal_2010@919.22:926.73 THEY HAD HALF THE CIVILIZATION GO OFF IN SEARCH OF A NEW WORLD SO THAT 'S WHERE I GET MY TWENTY ONE BILLION HOURS A WEEK OF GAME PLAY
JaneMcGonigal_2010@926.73:934.57 FROM LET 'S GET HALF OF US TO AGREE TO SPEND AN HOUR A DAY PLAYING GAMES UNTIL WE SOLVE REAL WORLD PROBLEMS NOW I KNOW YOU 'RE ASKING
JaneMcGonigal_2010@934.57:941.91 HOW ARE WE GOING TO SOLVE REAL WORLD PROBLEMS IN GAMES WELL THAT 'S WHAT I HAVE DEVOTED MY WORK TO OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AT THE INSTITUTE FOR THE FUTURE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@941.91:952.96 WE HAVE THIS BANNER IN OUR OFFICES IN PALO ALTO AND IT EXPRESSES OUR VIEW OF HOW WE SHOULD TRY TO RELATE TO THE FUTURE WE DO NOT WANT TO TRY TO PREDICT THE FUTURE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE THE FUTURE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@952.96:963.93 WE WANT TO IMAGINE THE BEST CASE SCENARIO OUTCOME AND THEN WE WANT TO EMPOWER PEOPLE TO MAKE THAT OUTCOME A REALITY WE WANT TO IMAGINE EPIC WINS AND THEN GIVE PEOPLE THE MEANS TO ACHIEVE THE EPIC WIN
JaneMcGonigal_2010@963.93:971.42 I 'M JUST GOING TO VERY BRIEFLY SHOW YOU THREE GAMES THAT I 'VE MADE THAT ARE AN ATTEMPT TO GIVE PEOPLE THE MEANS TO CREATE EPIC WINS IN THEIR OWN FUTURES
JaneMcGonigal_2010@971.42:979.47 SO THIS IS WORLD WITHOUT OIL WE MADE THIS GAME IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THIS IS AN ONLINE GAME IN WHICH YOU TRY TO SURVIVE AN OIL SHORTAGE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@979.47:990.23 THE OIL SHORTAGE IS FICTIONAL BUT WE PUT ENOUGH ONLINE CONTENT OUT THERE FOR YOU TO BELIEVE THAT IT 'S REAL AND TO LIVE YOUR REAL LIFE AS IF WE 'VE RUN OUT OF OIL SO WHEN YOU COME TO THE GAME
JaneMcGonigal_2010@990.23:1010.19 YOU SIGN UP YOU TELL US WHERE YOU LIVE AND THEN WE GIVE YOU REAL TIME NEWS VIDEOS DATA FEEDS THAT SHOW YOU EXACTLY HOW MUCH OIL COSTS WHAT 'S NOT AVAILABLE HOW FOOD SUPPLY IS BEING AFFECTED HOW TRANSPORTATION IS BEING AFFECTED IF SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED IF THEIR IS RIOTING AND YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU WOULD LIVE YOUR REAL LIFE AS IF THIS WERE TRUE AND THEN WE ASK YOU TO BLOG ABOUT IT
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1010.19:1023.77 TO POST VIDEOS TO POST PHOTOS WE PILOTED THIS GAME WITH SEVENTEEN HUNDRED PLAYERS IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND WE 'VE TRACKED THEM FOR THE THREE YEARS SINCE AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS A TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCE NOBODY WANTS TO CHANGE HOW THEY LIVE JUST BECAUSE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1023.77:1030.18 IT 'S GOOD FOR THE WORLD OR BECAUSE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BUT IF YOU IMMERSE THEM IN AN EPIC ADVENTURE AND TELL THEM
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1030.18:1040.47 WE 'VE RUN OUT OF OIL THIS IS AN AMAZING STORY AND ADVENTURE FOR YOU TO GO ON CHALLENGE YOURSELF TO SEE HOW YOU WOULD SURVIVE MOST OF OUR PLAYERS HAVE KEPT UP THE HABITS THAT THEY LEARNED IN THIS GAME
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1040.47:1049.74 SO FOR THE NEXT WORLD SAVING GAME WE DECIDED TO AIM HIGHER BIGGER PROBLEM THAN JUST PEAK OIL WE DID A GAME CALLED SUPERSTRUCT AT THE INSTITUTE FOR THE FUTURE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1049.74:1064.88 AND THE PREMISE WAS A SUPERCOMPUTER HAS CALCULATED THAT HUMANS HAVE ONLY TWENTY THREE YEARS LEFT ON THE PLANET THIS SUPERCOMPUTER WAS CALLED THE GLOBAL EXTINCTION AWARENESS SYSTEM OF COURSE WE ASKED PEOPLE TO COME ONLINE ALMOST LIKE A JERRY BRUCKHEIMER MOVIE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1064.88:1072.24 YOU KNOW JERRY BRUCKHEIMER MOVIES YOU FORM A DREAM TEAM YOU 'VE GOT THE ASTRONAUT THE SCIENTIST THE EX CONVICT AND THEY ALL HAVE SOMETHING TO DO TO SAVE THE WORLD
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1072.24:1073.54 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1073.54:1079.39 BUT IN OUR GAME INSTEAD OF JUST HAVING FIVE PEOPLE ON THE DREAM TEAM WE SAID EVERYBODY IS ON THE DREAM TEAM AND IT 'S YOUR JOB
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1079.39:1086.42 TO INVENT THE FUTURE OF ENERGY THE FUTURE OF FOOD THE FUTURE OF HEALTH THE FUTURE OF SECURITY AND THE FUTURE OF THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1086.42:1094.61 WE HAD EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE PLAY THAT GAME FOR EIGHT WEEKS THEY CAME UP WITH FIVE HUNDRED INSANELY CREATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT YOU CAN GO ONLINE IF YOU GOOGLE SUPERSTRUCT AND SEE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1094.61:1101.87 SO FINALLY THE LAST GAME WE 'RE LAUNCHING IT MARCH THIRD THIS IS A GAME DONE WITH THE WORLD BANK INSTITUTE IF YOU COMPLETE THE GAME YOU WILL BE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1101.87:1114.8 CERTIFIED BY THE WORLD BANK INSTITUTE AS A SOCIAL INNOVATOR CLASS OF TWO THOUSAND TEN WORKING WITH UNIVERSITIES ALL OVER SUB SAHARAN AFRICA AND WE ARE INVITING THEM TO LEARN SOCIAL INNOVATION SKILLS WE 'VE GOT A GRAPHIC NOVEL
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1114.8:1134.38 WE 'VE GOT LEVELING UP IN SKILLS LIKE LOCAL INSIGHT KNOWLEDGE NETWORKING SUSTAINABILITY VISION AND RESOURCEFULNESS I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE ALL OF YOU TO PLEASE SHARE THIS GAME WITH YOUNG PEOPLE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPING AREAS WHO MIGHT BENEFIT FROM COMING TOGETHER TO TRY TO START TO IMAGINE THEIR OWN SOCIAL ENTERPRISES TO SAVE THE WORLD
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1134.38:1147.24 SO I 'M GOING TO WRAP UP NOW I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS NEXT WE 'VE GOT ALL THESE AMAZING GAMERS WE 'VE GOT THESE GAMES THAT ARE KIND OF PILOTS OF WHAT WE MIGHT DO BUT NONE OF THEM HAVE SAVED THE REAL WORLD YET
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1147.24:1153.06 WELL I HOPE THAT YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT GAMERS ARE A HUMAN RESOURCE THAT WE CAN USE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1153.06:1168.34 TO DO REAL WORLD WORK THAT GAMES ARE A POWERFUL PLATFORM FOR CHANGE WE HAVE ALL THESE AMAZING SUPERPOWERS BLISSFUL PRODUCTIVITY THE ABILITY TO WEAVE A TIGHT SOCIAL FABRIC THIS FEELING OF URGENT OPTIMISM AND THE DESIRE FOR EPIC MEANING I REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1168.34:1178.91 TO PLAY GAMES THAT MATTER TO SURVIVE ON THIS PLANET FOR ANOTHER CENTURY AND THAT 'S MY HOPE THAT YOU WILL JOIN ME IN MAKING AND PLAYING GAMES LIKE THIS WHEN I LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT DECADE I KNOW TWO THINGS FOR SURE
JaneMcGonigal_2010@1178.91:1187.61 THAT WE CAN MAKE ANY FUTURE WE CAN IMAGINE AND WE CAN PLAY ANY GAMES WE WANT SO I SAY LET THE WORLD CHANGING GAMES BEGIN THANK YOU
