NeilMacGregor_2011G I WANT THIS MORNING TO TALK ABOUT THE STORY THE BIOGRAPHY OR RATHER THE BIOGRAPHIES OF ONE PARTICULAR OBJECT ONE REMARKABLE THING
NeilMacGregor_2011G IT DOESN 'T I AGREE LOOK VERY MUCH IT 'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A RUGBY BALL IT 'S MADE OF CLAY AND IT 'S BEEN FASHIONED INTO A CYLINDER SHAPE COVERED WITH CLOSE WRITING
NeilMacGregor_2011G THE STORY BEGINS IN THE IRAN IRAQ WAR AND THAT SERIES OF EVENTS THAT CULMINATED IN THE INVASION OF IRAQ BY FOREIGN FORCES THE REMOVAL OF A DESPOTIC RULER AND INSTANT REGIME CHANGE
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND I WANT TO BEGIN WITH ONE EPISODE FROM THAT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT MOST OF YOU WOULD BE VERY FAMILIAR WITH
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND THE PARALLELS BETWEEN THE EVENTS OF FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE BC AND TWO THOUSAND AND THREE AND IN BETWEEN ARE STARTLING
NeilMacGregor_2011G WHAT YOU 'RE LOOKING AT IS REMBRANDT 'S PAINTING NOW IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY IN LONDON ILLUSTRATING THE TEXT FROM THE PROPHET DANIEL IN THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND YOU ALL KNOW ROUGHLY THE STORY BELSHAZZAR THE SON OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR NEBUCHADNEZZAR WHO 'D CONQUERED ISRAEL SACKED JERUSALEM AND CAPTURED THE PEOPLE AND TAKEN THE JEWS BACK TO BABYLON NOT ONLY THE JEWS HE 'D TAKEN THE TEMPLE VESSELS HE 'D RANSACKED DESECRATED THE TEMPLE
NeilMacGregor_2011G HIS SON DECIDES TO HAVE A FEAST AND IN ORDER TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE EXCITING HE ADDED A BIT OF SACRILEGE TO THE REST OF THE FUN AND HE BRINGS OUT THE TEMPLE VESSELS HE 'S ALREADY AT WAR WITH THE IRANIANS WITH THE KING OF PERSIA AND THAT NIGHT
NeilMacGregor_2011G IT IS OF COURSE A GREAT MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE IT 'S A GREAT STORY IT 'S STORY WE ALL KNOW THE WRITING ON THE WALL IS PART OF OUR EVERYDAY LANGUAGE
NeilMacGregor_2011G WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WAS REMARKABLE
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND IT 'S WHERE OUR CYLINDER ENTERS THE STORY CYRUS KING OF THE PERSIANS HAS ENTERED BABYLON WITHOUT A FIGHT THE GREAT EMPIRE OF BABYLON WHICH RAN FROM CENTRAL SOUTHERN IRAQ TO THE MEDITERRANEAN FALLS TO CYRUS AND CYRUS MAKES A DECLARATION
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND THAT IS WHAT THIS CYLINDER IS THE DECLARATION MADE BY THE RULER GUIDED BY GOD WHO HAD TOPPLED THE IRAQI DESPOT
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND WAS GOING TO BRING FREEDOM TO THE PEOPLE
NeilMacGregor_2011G BY A VICTORIOUS ARMY THAT WE 'VE GOT
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND IT 'S WRITTEN AS WE 'LL SEE IN DUE COURSE BY VERY SKILLED P R CONSULTANTS SO THE HYPERBOLE IS NOT ACTUALLY SURPRISING AND WHAT IS THE GREAT KING THE POWERFUL KING THE KING OF THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THE WORLD GOING TO DO
NeilMacGregor_2011G HE GOES ON TO SAY THAT HAVING CONQUERED BABYLON HE WILL AT ONCE LET ALL THE PEOPLES THAT THE BABYLONIANS NEBUCHADNEZZAR AND BELSHAZZAR HAVE CAPTURED AND ENSLAVED GO FREE HE 'LL LET THEM RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRIES AND MORE IMPORTANT HE WILL LET THEM ALL RECOVER
NeilMacGregor_2011G THE GODS THE STATUES THE TEMPLE VESSELS THAT HAD BEEN CONFISCATED
NeilMacGregor_2011G ALL THE PEOPLES THAT THE BABYLONIANS HAD REPRESSED AND REMOVED WILL GO HOME AND THEY 'LL TAKE WITH THEM THEIR GODS AND THEY 'LL BE ABLE TO RESTORE THEIR ALTARS AND TO WORSHIP THEIR GODS IN THEIR OWN WAY IN THEIR OWN PLACE
NeilMacGregor_2011G THIS IS THE DECREE
NeilMacGregor_2011G THIS OBJECT IS THE EVIDENCE FOR THE FACT THAT THE JEWS AFTER THE EXILE IN BABYLON THE YEARS THEY 'D SPENT SITTING BY THE WATERS OF BABYLON WEEPING WHEN THEY REMEMBERED JERUSALEM THOSE JEWS WERE ALLOWED TO GO HOME
NeilMacGregor_2011G THEY WERE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO JERUSALEM AND TO REBUILD THE TEMPLE
NeilMacGregor_2011G THIS IS THE JEWISH VERSION OF THE SAME STORY THUS SAID CYRUS KING OF PERSIA ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH HAVE THE LORD GOD OF HEAVEN GIVEN THEE AND HE HAS CHARGED ME TO BUILD HIM A HOUSE IN JERUSALEM WHO IS THERE AMONG YOU OF HIS PEOPLE THE LORD GOD BE WITH HIM AND LET HIM GO UP
NeilMacGregor_2011G GO UP AALEH THE CENTRAL ELEMENT STILL OF THE NOTION OF RETURN A CENTRAL PART OF THE LIFE OF JUDAISM
NeilMacGregor_2011G AS YOU ALL KNOW THAT RETURN FROM EXILE THE SECOND TEMPLE RESHAPED JUDAISM AND THAT CHANGE THAT GREAT HISTORIC MOMENT WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY CYRUS THE KING OF PERSIA REPORTED FOR US IN HEBREW IN SCRIPTURE AND IN BABYLONIAN IN CLAY
NeilMacGregor_2011G TWO GREAT TEXTS WHAT ABOUT THE POLITICS WHAT WAS GOING ON
NeilMacGregor_2011G WAS THE FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN MIDDLE EASTERN HISTORY THE EMPIRE OF IRAN THE MEDES AND THE PERSIANS UNITED UNDER CYRUS BECAME THE FIRST GREAT WORLD EMPIRE
NeilMacGregor_2011G THIS EMPIRE IS IN FACT THE MIDDLE EAST AS WE NOW KNOW IT AND IT 'S WHAT SHAPES THE MIDDLE EAST AS WE NOW KNOW IT IT WAS THE LARGEST EMPIRE THE WORLD HAD KNOWN UNTIL THEN MUCH MORE IMPORTANT IT WAS THE FIRST
NeilMacGregor_2011G MULTICULTURAL MULTIFAITH STATE ON A HUGE SCALE AND IT HAD TO BE RUN IN A QUITE NEW WAY
NeilMacGregor_2011G IT HAD TO BE RUN IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THE FACT THAT THIS DECREE IS IN BABYLONIAN SAYS ONE THING AND IT HAD TO RECOGNIZE THEIR DIFFERENT HABITS DIFFERENT PEOPLES DIFFERENT RELIGIONS DIFFERENT FAITHS ALL OF THOSE ARE RESPECTED BY CYRUS
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND THE RESULT OF THAT WAS AN EMPIRE THAT INCLUDED THE AREAS YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN AND WHICH SURVIVED FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF STABILITY UNTIL IT WAS SHATTERED BY ALEXANDER
NeilMacGregor_2011G IT LEFT A DREAM OF THE MIDDLE EAST AS A UNIT AND A UNIT WHERE PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT FAITHS COULD LIVE TOGETHER
NeilMacGregor_2011G THE GREEK INVASIONS ENDED THAT AND OF COURSE ALEXANDER COULDN 'T SUSTAIN A GOVERNMENT AND IT FRAGMENTED BUT WHAT CYRUS REPRESENTED REMAINED ABSOLUTELY CENTRAL THE GREEK HISTORIAN XENOPHON
NeilMacGregor_2011G WROTE HIS BOOK CYROPAEDIA PROMOTING CYRUS AS THE GREAT RULER AND THROUGHOUT EUROPEAN CULTURE AFTERWARD CYRUS REMAINED THE MODEL THIS IS A SIXTEENTH CENTURY IMAGE TO SHOW YOU HOW WIDESPREAD HIS VENERATION ACTUALLY WAS
NeilMacGregor_2011G XENOPHON 'S BOOK ON CYRUS ON HOW YOU RAN A DIVERSE SOCIETY WAS ONE OF THE GREAT TEXTBOOKS THAT INSPIRED THE FOUNDING FATHERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION
NeilMacGregor_2011G JEFFERSON WAS A GREAT ADMIRER THE IDEALS OF CYRUS OBVIOUSLY SPEAKING TO THOSE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IDEALS OF HOW YOU CREATE RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE IN A NEW STATE
NeilMacGregor_2011G BACK IN BABYLON THINGS HAD NOT BEEN GOING WELL AFTER ALEXANDER THE OTHER EMPIRES BABYLON DECLINES FALLS INTO RUINS AND ALL THE TRACES OF THE GREAT BABYLONIAN EMPIRE ARE LOST
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND IT ENTERS NOW ANOTHER STORY IT ENTERS THAT GREAT DEBATE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY ARE THE SCRIPTURES RELIABLE CAN WE TRUST THEM
NeilMacGregor_2011G BUT AND THIS OF COURSE IS WHERE IT BECOMES COMPLICATED THE FACTS WERE TRUE
NeilMacGregor_2011G HURRAH FOR ARCHEOLOGY BUT THE INTERPRETATION WAS RATHER MORE COMPLICATED
NeilMacGregor_2011G BECAUSE THE CYLINDER ACCOUNT AND THE HEBREW BIBLE ACCOUNT DIFFER IN ONE KEY RESPECT
NeilMacGregor_2011G THE BABYLONIAN CYLINDER IS WRITTEN BY THE PRIESTS OF THE GREAT GOD OF BABLYON MARDUK AND NOT SURPRISINGLY THEY TELL YOU THAT ALL THIS WAS DONE BY MARDUK
NeilMacGregor_2011G MARDUK WE HOLD CALLED CYRUS BY HIS NAME MARDUK TAKES CYRUS BY THE HAND CALLS HIM TO SHEPHERD HIS PEOPLE AND GIVES HIM THE RULE OF BABYLON
NeilMacGregor_2011G MARDUK TELLS CYRUS THAT HE WILL DO THESE GREAT GENEROUS THINGS OF SETTING THE PEOPLE FREE AND THIS IS WHY WE SHOULD ALL BE GRATEFUL TO AND WORSHIP MARDUK
NeilMacGregor_2011G THE HEBREW WRITERS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED TO LEARN TAKE A RATHER DIFFERENT VIEW OF
NeilMacGregor_2011G NOT TO MARDUK BUT TO THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL WHO ALSO CALLED CYRUS BY NAME ALSO TAKES CYRUS BY THE HAND AND TALKS OF HIM SHEPHERDING HIS PEOPLE
NeilMacGregor_2011G IT 'S A REMARKABLE EXAMPLE OF TWO DIFFERENT PRIESTLY APPROPRIATIONS OF THE SAME EVENT TWO DIFFERENT RELIGIOUS TAKEOVERS OF A POLITICAL FACT GOD WE KNOW IS USUALLY ON THE SIDE OF THE BIG BATTALIONS THE QUESTION IS WHICH GOD WAS IT
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND THE DEBATE UNSETTLES EVERYBODY IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY TO REALIZE THAT THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES ARE PART OF A MUCH WIDER WORLD OF RELIGION AND IT 'S QUITE CLEAR THE CYLINDER IS OLDER THAN THE TEXT OF ISAIAH AND YET
NeilMacGregor_2011G JEHOVAH IS SPEAKING IN WORDS VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY MARDUK
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND THERE 'S A SLIGHT SENSE THAT ISAIAH KNOWS THIS BECAUSE HE SAYS
NeilMacGregor_2011G I THINK IT 'S RECOGNIZED THAT CYRUS DOESN 'T REALIZE THAT HE 'S ACTING UNDER ORDERS FROM JEHOVAH AND EQUALLY HE 'D HAVE BEEN SURPRISED THAT HE WAS ACTING UNDER ORDERS FROM MARDUK BECAUSE INTERESTINGLY OF COURSE CYRUS IS A GOOD IRANIAN WITH A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SET OF GODS WHO ARE NOT MENTIONED IN ANY OF THESE TEXTS
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND THE RESPONSE TO THIS BY THE JEWISH POPULATION IN EASTERN EUROPE IS RHAPSODIC
NeilMacGregor_2011G THE TWO GREAT RULERS WHO HAVE ALLOWED THE RETURN TO JERUSALEM AND THE CYRUS CYLINDER COMES BACK INTO PUBLIC VIEW AND THE TEXT OF THIS AS A DEMONSTRATION OF WHY WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN
NeilMacGregor_2011G AFTER THE WAR IS OVER IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN IS PART OF A DIVINE PLAN
NeilMacGregor_2011G YOU ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND ANOTHER STORY OF THE CYLINDER BEGINS THE REGION THE U K AND THE U S DECIDE HAS TO BE KEPT SAFE FROM COMMUNISM AND THE SUPERPOWER THAT WILL BE CREATED TO DO THIS WOULD BE IRAN THE SHAH
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND SO THE SHAH INVENTS AN IRANIAN HISTORY OR A RETURN TO IRANIAN HISTORY THAT PUTS HIM IN THE CENTER OF A GREAT TRADITION
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND PRODUCES COINS SHOWING HIMSELF
NeilMacGregor_2011G CYRUS CYLINDER GUARANTOR OF THE SHAH TEN YEARS LATER ANOTHER STORY IRANIAN REVOLUTION ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION NO MORE CYRUS WE 'RE NOT INTERESTED IN THAT HISTORY WE 'RE INTERESTED IN ISLAMIC IRAN
NeilMacGregor_2011G UNTIL IRAQ THE NEW SUPERPOWER THAT WE 'VE ALL DECIDED SHOULD BE IN THE REGION ATTACKS
NeilMacGregor_2011G THEN ANOTHER IRAN IRAQ WAR AND IT BECOMES CRITICAL FOR THE IRANIANS TO REMEMBER THEIR GREAT PAST THEIR GREAT PAST WHEN THEY FOUGHT IRAQ AND WON IT BECOMES CRITICAL TO FIND A SYMBOL
NeilMacGregor_2011G THAT WILL PULL TOGETHER ALL IRANIANS MUSLIMS AND NON MUSLIMS CHRISTIANS ZOROASTRIANS JEWS LIVING IN IRAN PEOPLE WHO ARE DEVOUT NOT DEVOUT AND THE OBVIOUS EMBLEM IS CYRUS
NeilMacGregor_2011G SO WHEN THE BRITISH MUSEUM AND TEHRAN NATIONAL MUSUEM COOPERATE AND WORK TOGETHER AS WE 'VE BEEN DOING THE IRANIANS ASK FOR ONE THING ONLY AS A LOAN IT 'S THE ONLY OBJECT THEY WANT THEY WANT TO BORROW THE CYRUS CYLINDER AND LAST YEAR THE CYRUS CYLINDER WENT TO
NeilMacGregor_2011G TEHRAN FOR THE SECOND TIME IT 'S SHOWN BEING PRESENTED HERE PUT INTO ITS CASE BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF TEHRAN ONE OF THE MANY WOMEN IN IRAN IN VERY SENIOR POSITIONS MRS ARDAKANI IT WAS A HUGE EVENT THIS IS THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT SAME PICTURE
NeilMacGregor_2011G IT 'S SEEN IN TEHRAN BY BETWEEN ONE AND TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN THE SPACE OF A FEW MONTHS THIS IS BEYOND ANY BLOCKBUSTER EXHIBITION IN THE WEST
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND IT 'S THE SUBJECT OF A HUGE DEBATE ABOUT WHAT THIS CYLINDER MEANS WHAT CYRUS MEANS BUT ABOVE ALL CYRUS AS ARTICULATED THROUGH THIS CYLINDER CYRUS AS THE DEFENDER OF THE HOMELAND THE CHAMPION OF COURSE OF IRANIAN IDENTITY AND OF THE IRANIAN PEOPLES TOLERANT OF ALL FAITHS
NeilMacGregor_2011G THOUSANDS OF JEWS LIVING IN IRAN CAME TO TEHRAN TO SEE IT IT BECAME A GREAT EMBLEM A GREAT SUBJECT OF DEBATE ABOUT WHAT IRAN IS AT HOME AND ABROAD
NeilMacGregor_2011G IS IRAN STILL TO BE THE DEFENDER OF THE OPPRESSED WILL IRAN SET FREE THE PEOPLE THAT THE TYRANTS HAVE ENSLAVED AND EXPROPRIATED THIS IS HEADY NATIONAL RHETORIC
NeilMacGregor_2011G IT WAS ALL PUT TOGETHER IN A GREAT PAGEANT
NeilMacGregor_2011G THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF AND
NeilMacGregor_2011G FOR ME TO TAKE THIS OBJECT TO IRAN TO BE ALLOWED TO TAKE THIS OBJECT TO IRAN WAS TO BE ALLOWED TO BE PART OF AN EXTRAORDINARY DEBATE
NeilMacGregor_2011G LED AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS ABOUT WHAT IRAN IS WHAT DIFFERENT IRANS THERE ARE AND HOW THE DIFFERENT HISTORIES OF IRAN MIGHT SHAPE THE WORLD TODAY
NeilMacGregor_2011G IT 'S A DEBATE THAT 'S STILL CONTINUING
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO RUMBLE BECAUSE THIS OBJECT IS ONE OF THE GREAT DECLARATIONS OF A HUMAN ASPIRATION IT STANDS WITH
NeilMacGregor_2011G THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION IT CERTAINLY SAYS FAR MORE ABOUT REAL FREEDOMS THAN MAGNA CARTA IT IS A DOCUMENT THAT CAN MEAN SO MANY THINGS FOR IRAN AND FOR THE REGION A REPLICA OF THIS IS AT THE UNITED NATIONS
NeilMacGregor_2011G IN NEW YORK THIS AUTUMN IT WILL BE PRESENT WHEN THE GREAT DEBATES ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE MIDDLE EAST TAKE PLACE
NeilMacGregor_2011G AND I WANT TO FINISH BY ASKING YOU WHAT THE NEXT STORY WILL BE IN WHICH THIS OBJECT FIGURES IT WILL APPEAR CERTAINLY IN MANY MORE MIDDLE EASTERN STORIES AND WHAT STORY OF THE MIDDLE EAST WHAT STORY OF THE WORLD DO YOU WANT TO SEE REFLECTING WHAT IS SAID
NeilMacGregor_2011G IN THE WORLD OF THE MIDDLE EAST AT THE MOMENT THE DEBATES ARE AS YOU KNOW SHRILL
NeilMacGregor_2011G BUT I THINK IT 'S POSSIBLE THAT THE MOST POWERFUL AND THE WISEST VOICE OF ALL OF THEM MAY WELL BE THE VOICE OF THIS MUTE THING THE CYRUS CYLINDER
