PaulZak_2011G@37.89:41.41 ALSO KNOWN AS MY MOM
PaulZak_2011G@41.41:46.63 AS AN ALTAR BOY I BREATHED IN A LOT OF INCENSE AND I LEARNED TO SAY PHRASES IN LATIN
PaulZak_2011G@46.63:61.62 BUT I ALSO HAD TIME TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER MY MOTHER 'S TOP DOWN MORALITY APPLIED TO EVERYBODY I SAW THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE RELIGIOUS AND NON RELIGIOUS WERE EQUALLY OBSESSED WITH MORALITY I THOUGHT MAYBE THERE 'S SOME EARTHLY BASIS FOR MORAL DECISIONS
PaulZak_2011G@61.62:65.54 BUT I WANTED TO GO FURTHER THAN TO SAY OUR BRAINS MAKE US MORAL
PaulZak_2011G@65.97:70.1 I WANT TO KNOW IF THERE 'S A CHEMISTRY OF MORALITY I WANT TO KNOW
PaulZak_2011G@70.14:72.43 IF THERE WAS A MORAL MOLECULE
PaulZak_2011G@73.25:84.01 AFTER TEN YEARS OF EXPERIMENTS I FOUND IT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT I BROUGHT SOME WITH ME THIS LITTLE SYRINGE CONTAINS THE MORAL MOLECULE
PaulZak_2011G@93.27:109.74 'S CALLED OXYTOCIN SO OXYTOCIN IS A SIMPLE AND ANCIENT MOLECULE FOUND ONLY IN MAMMALS IN RODENTS IT WAS KNOWN TO MAKE MOTHERS CARE FOR THEIR OFFSPRING AND IN SOME CREATURES ALLOWED FOR TOLERATION OF BURROWMATES
PaulZak_2011G@109.74:116.88 BUT IN HUMANS IT WAS ONLY KNOWN TO FACILITATE BIRTH AND BREASTFEEDING IN WOMEN AND IS RELEASED BY BOTH SEXES DURING SEX
PaulZak_2011G@116.88:128.27 SO I HAD THIS IDEA THAT OXYTOCIN MIGHT BE THE MORAL MOLECULE I DID WHAT MOST OF US DO I TRIED IT ON SOME COLLEAGUES ONE OF THEM TOLD ME PAUL THAT IS THE WORLD 'S STUPIDIST IDEA
PaulZak_2011G@128.27:137.16 IT IS HE SAID ONLY A FEMALE MOLECULE IT CAN 'T BE THAT IMPORTANT BUT I COUNTERED WELL MEN 'S BRAINS MAKE THIS TOO THERE MUST BE A REASON WHY
PaulZak_2011G@137.38:148.15 BUT HE WAS RIGHT IT WAS A STUPID IDEA BUT IT WAS TESTABLY STUPID IN OTHER WORDS I THOUGHT I COULD DESIGN AN EXPERIMENT TO SEE IF OXYTOCIN MADE PEOPLE MORAL
PaulZak_2011G@148.23:151.49 TURNS OUT IT WASN 'T SO EASY
PaulZak_2011G@151.49:168.97 FIRST OF ALL OXYTOCIN IS A SHY MOLECULE BASELINE LEVELS ARE NEAR ZERO WITHOUT SOME STIMULUS TO CAUSE ITS RELEASE AND WHEN IT 'S PRODUCED IT HAS A THREE MINUTE HALF LIFE AND DEGRADES RAPIDLY AT ROOM TEMPERATURE SO THIS EXPERIMENT WOULD HAVE TO CAUSE A SURGE OF OXYTOCIN HAVE TO GRAB IT FAST AND KEEP IT COLD
PaulZak_2011G@169.23:175.28 I THINK I CAN DO THAT NOW LUCKILY OXYTOCIN IS PRODUCED BOTH IN THE BRAIN AND IN THE BLOOD
PaulZak_2011G@175.32:178.85 SO I COULD DO THIS EXPERIMENT WITHOUT LEARNING NEUROSURGERY
PaulZak_2011G@178.85:190.96 THEN I HAD TO MEASURE MORALITY SO TAKING ON MORALITY WITH A CAPITAL M IS A HUGE PROJECT SO I STARTED SMALLER I STUDIED ONE SINGLE VIRTUE
PaulZak_2011G@190.96:210.64 TRUSTWORTHINESS WHY I HAD SHOWN IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSAND S THAT COUNTRIES WITH A HIGHER PROPORTION OF TRUSTWORTHY PEOPLE ARE MORE PROSPEROUS SO IN THESE COUNTRIES MORE ECONOMIC TRANSACTIONS OCCUR AND MORE WEALTH IS CREATED ALLEVIATING POVERTY SO POOR COUNTRIES ARE BY AND LARGE LOW TRUST COUNTRIES
PaulZak_2011G@227.59:235.54 SO WHAT WE DO IN MY LAB IS WE TEMPT PEOPLE WITH VIRTUE AND VICE BY USING MONEY LET ME SHOW YOU HOW WE DO THAT SO WE RECRUIT SOME PEOPLE FOR AN EXPERIMENT
PaulZak_2011G@250.49:252.74 AND SHIP IT TO SOMEONE ELSE IN THE LAB
PaulZak_2011G@253.04:257.98 THE TRICK IS YOU CAN 'T SEE THEM YOU CAN 'T TALK TO THEM YOU ONLY DO IT ONE TIME
PaulZak_2011G@258.22:261.18 NOW WHATEVER YOU GIVE UP GETS TRIPLED
PaulZak_2011G@261.19:262.7 IN THE OTHER PERSON 'S ACCOUNT
PaulZak_2011G@308.53:326.83 BUT IN FACT ECONOMISTS WERE FLUMMOXED ON WHY THE SECOND PERSON WOULD EVER RETURN ANY MONEY THEY ASSUMED MONEY IS GOOD WHY NOT KEEP IT ALL THAT 'S NOT WHAT WE FOUND WE FOUND NINETY PERCENT OF THE FIRST DECISION MAKERS SENT MONEY AND OF THOSE WHO RECEIVED MONEY NINETY FIVE PERCENT RETURNED SOME OF IT
PaulZak_2011G@326.83:338.57 BUT WHY WELL BY MEASURING OXYTOCIN WE FOUND THAT THE MORE MONEY THE SECOND PERSON RECEIVED THE MORE THEIR BRAIN PRODUCED OXYTOCIN AND THE MORE OXYTOCIN ON BOARD THE MORE MONEY THEY RETURNED
PaulZak_2011G@338.57:345.51 SO WE HAVE A BIOLOGY OF TRUSTWORTHINESS BUT WAIT WHAT 'S WRONG WITH THIS EXPERIMENT
PaulZak_2011G@345.81:355.34 TWO THINGS ONE IS THAT NOTHING IN THE BODY HAPPENS IN ISOLATION SO WE MEASURED NINE OTHER MOLECULES THAT INTERACT WITH OXYTOCIN BUT THEY DIDN 'T HAVE ANY EFFECT
PaulZak_2011G@355.34:365.87 BUT THE SECOND IS THAT I STILL ONLY HAD THIS INDIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OXYTOCIN AND TRUSTWORTHINESS I DIDN 'T KNOW FOR SURE OXYTOCIN CAUSED TRUSTWORTHINESS
PaulZak_2011G@371.52:376.48 I USED EVERYTHING SHORT OF A DRILL TO GET OXYTOCIN INTO MY OWN BRAIN
PaulZak_2011G@376.87:379.58 AND I FOUND I COULD DO IT WITH A NASAL INHALER
PaulZak_2011G@380.19:394.28 SO ALONG WITH COLLEAGUES IN ZURICH WE PUT TWO HUNDRED MEN ON OXYTOCIN OR PLACEBO HAD THAT SAME TRUST TEST WITH MONEY AND WE FOUND THAT THOSE ON OXYTOCIN NOT ONLY SHOWED MORE TRUST WE CAN MORE THAN DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO SENT ALL THEIR MONEY TO A STRANGER
PaulZak_2011G@394.73:397.71 ALL WITHOUT ALTERING MOOD OR COGNITION
PaulZak_2011G@398.58:401.92 SO OXYTOCIN IS THE TRUST MOLECULE
PaulZak_2011G@402.39:404.58 BUT IS IT THE MORAL MOLECULE
PaulZak_2011G@405.64:407.53 USING THE OXYTOCIN INHALER
PaulZak_2011G@407.65:417.05 WE RAN MORE STUDIES WE SHOWED THAT OXYTOCIN INFUSION INCREASES GENEROSITY IN UNILATERAL MONETARY TRANSFERS BY EIGHTY PERCENT
PaulZak_2011G@417.23:421.15 WE SHOWED IT INCREASES DONATIONS TO CHARITY BY FIFTY PERCENT
PaulZak_2011G@439.14:453.6 BUT WHY DO THEY DO THIS WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE WHEN YOUR BRAIN IS FLOODED WITH OXYTOCIN TO INVESTIGATE THIS QUESTION WE RAN AN EXPERIMENT WHERE WE HAD PEOPLE WATCH A VIDEO OF A FATHER AND HIS FOUR YEAR OLD SON AND HIS SON HAS TERMINAL BRAIN CANCER
PaulZak_2011G@454.05:460.23 AFTER THEY WATCHED THE VIDEO WE HAD THEM RATE THEIR FEELINGS AND TOOK BLOOD BEFORE AND AFTER TO MEASURE OXYTOCIN
PaulZak_2011G@460.31:475.32 THE CHANGE IN OXYTOCIN PREDICTED THEIR FEELINGS OF EMPATHY SO IT 'S EMPATHY THAT MAKES US CONNECT TO OTHER PEOPLE IT 'S EMPATHY THAT MAKES US HELP OTHER PEOPLE IT 'S EMPATHY THAT MAKES US MORAL
PaulZak_2011G@475.92:478.19 NOW THIS IDEA IS NOT NEW
PaulZak_2011G@492.54:506.22 HE SAID WE 'RE SOCIAL CREATURES SO WE SHARE THE EMOTIONS OF OTHERS SO IF I DO SOMETHING THAT HURTS YOU I FEEL THAT PAIN SO I TEND TO AVOID THAT IF I DO SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY I GET TO SHARE YOUR JOY SO I TEND TO DO THOSE THINGS
PaulZak_2011G@506.22:518.75 NOW THIS IS THE SAME ADAM SMITH WHO SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER WOULD WRITE A LITTLE BOOK CALLED THE WEALTH OF NATIONS THE FOUNDING DOCUMENT OF ECONOMICS BUT HE WAS IN FACT A MORAL PHILOSOPHER AND HE WAS RIGHT ON WHY WE 'RE MORAL
PaulZak_2011G@519.05:521.44 I JUST FOUND THE MOLECULE BEHIND IT
PaulZak_2011G@522.26:524.81 BUT KNOWING THAT MOLECULE IS VALUABLE
PaulZak_2011G@524.93:529.68 BECAUSE IT TELLS US HOW TO TURN UP THIS BEHAVIOR AND WHAT TURNS IT OFF
PaulZak_2011G@529.92:533.47 IN PARTICULAR IT TELLS US WHY WE SEE IMMORALITY
PaulZak_2011G@543.08:559.5 YOU SIT IN A GAS STATION ALL DAY YOU SEE LOTS OF MORALITY AND IMMORALITY LET ME TELL YOU SO ONE SUNDAY AFTERNOON A MAN WALKS INTO MY CASHIER 'S BOOTH WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL JEWELRY BOX OPENS IT UP AND THERE 'S A PEARL NECKLACE INSIDE AND HE SAID HEY I WAS IN THE MEN 'S ROOM I JUST FOUND THIS WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO WITH IT
PaulZak_2011G@597.44:599.64 AGAIN HE ASKED ME WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO
PaulZak_2011G@634.31:646.83 SO WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE WHO MANIPULATE OUR OXYTOCIN SYSTEMS WE FOUND TESTING THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT FIVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION DON 'T RELEASE OXYTOCIN ON STIMULUS
PaulZak_2011G@646.83:656.66 SO IF YOU TRUST THEM THEIR BRAINS DON 'T RELEASE OXYTOCIN IF THERE 'S MONEY ON THE TABLE THEY KEEP IT ALL SO THERE 'S A TECHNICAL WORD FOR THESE PEOPLE IN MY LAB WE CALL THEM
PaulZak_2011G@667.71:677.79 CAN BE INHIBITED ONE IS THROUGH IMPROPER NURTURING SO WE 'VE STUDIED SEXUALLY ABUSED WOMEN AND ABOUT HALF THOSE DON 'T RELEASE OXYTOCIN ON STIMULUS
PaulZak_2011G@677.79:688.69 YOU NEED ENOUGH NURTURING FOR THIS SYSTEM TO DEVELOP PROPERLY ALSO HIGH STRESS INHIBITS OXYTOCIN SO WE ALL KNOW THIS WHEN WE 'RE REALLY STRESSED OUT WE 'RE NOT ACTING OUR BEST
PaulZak_2011G@694.71:702.28 SO WE IN EXPERIMENTS HAVE ADMINISTERED TESTOSTERONE TO MEN AND INSTEAD OF SHARING MONEY THEY BECOME SELFISH
PaulZak_2011G@702.5:711.6 BUT INTERESTINGLY HIGH TESTOSTERONE MALES ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO USE THEIR OWN MONEY TO PUNISH OTHERS FOR BEING SELFISH
PaulZak_2011G@723.39:737.5 AND WE HAVE TESTOSTERONE AND MEN HAVE TEN TIMES THE TESTOSTERONE AS WOMEN SO MEN DO THIS MORE THAN WOMEN WE HAVE TESTOSTERONE THAT MAKES US WANT TO PUNISH PEOPLE WHO BEHAVE IMMORALLY WE DON 'T NEED GOD OR GOVERNMENT TELLING US WHAT TO DO IT 'S ALL INSIDE OF US
PaulZak_2011G@753.84:766.04 TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL VICTORIAN MANSION I DIDN 'T KNOW A SINGLE PERSON AND I DROVE UP IN MY RENTED VAUXHALL AND I TOOK OUT A CENTRIFUGE AND DRY ICE AND NEEDLES AND TUBES AND I TOOK
PaulZak_2011G@789.13:792.72 HER MOTHER THAT 'S RIGHT HER MOTHER WAS NUMBER TWO
PaulZak_2011G@793.05:799.6 THEN THE GROOM 'S FATHER THEN THE GROOM THEN THE FAMILY THEN THE FRIENDS ARRAYED AROUND THE BRIDE LIKE PLANETS AROUND THE SUN
PaulZak_2011G@799.6:805.75 SO I THINK IT TELLS US THAT WE 'VE DESIGNED THIS RITUAL TO CONNECT US TO THIS NEW COUPLE
PaulZak_2011G@806.47:812.67 CONNECT US EMOTIONALLY WHY BECAUSE WE NEED THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL AT REPRODUCING TO PERPETUATE THE SPECIES
PaulZak_2011G@827.22:832.02 I TOOK MY BLOOD BEFORE AND AFTER AND I HAD A HUGE SPIKE OF OXYTOCIN
PaulZak_2011G@832.18:846.29 AND THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS WE CAN CONNECT TO PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA MANY PEOPLE ARE TWEETING RIGHT NOW SO WE INVESTIGATED THE ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND FOUND THE USING SOCIAL MEDIA PRODUCED A SOLID DOUBLE DIGIT INCREASE IN OXYTOCIN
PaulZak_2011G@846.29:853.1 SO I RAN THIS EXPERIMENT RECENTLY FOR THE KOREAN BROADCASTING SYSTEM AND THEY HAD THE REPORTERS AND THEIR PRODUCERS PARTICIPATE
PaulZak_2011G@853.1:871.08 AND ONE OF THESE GUYS HE MUST HAVE BEEN TWENTY TWO HE HAD ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT SPIKE IN OXYTOCIN I MEAN ASTOUNDING NO ONE HAS THIS SO HE WAS USING SOCIAL MEDIA IN PRIVATE WHEN I WROTE MY REPORT TO THE KOREANS I SAID LOOK I DON 'T KNOW WHAT THIS GUY WAS DOING BUT MY GUESS WAS INTERACTING WITH HIS MOTHER OR HIS GIRLFRIEND THEY CHECKED
PaulZak_2011G@871.08:873.97 HE WAS INTERACTING ON HIS GIRLFRIEND 'S FACEBOOK PAGE
PaulZak_2011G@873.97:876.46 THERE YOU GO THAT 'S CONNECTION
PaulZak_2011G@887.58:902.52 VERY ISOLATED TRIBES OF SUBSISTENCE FARMERS LIVING AS THEY HAVE LIVED FOR MILLENIA THERE ARE EIGHT HUNDRED DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IN THE HIGHLANDS THESE ARE THE MOST PRIMITIVE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND THEY INDEED ALSO RELEASE OXYTOCIN
PaulZak_2011G@939.66:943.04 SO MY PENCHANT FOR HUGGING OTHER PEOPLE HAS EARNED ME THE NICKNAME DR LOVE
PaulZak_2011G@943.71:951.97 I 'M HAPPY TO SHARE A LITTLE MORE LOVE IN THE WORLD IT 'S GREAT BUT HERE 'S YOUR PRESCRIPTION FROM DR LOVE EIGHT HUGS A DAY
