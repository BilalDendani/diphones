MarcusByrne_2012X@49.01:55.31 SO THE QUESTION IS WHERE DO WE START THIS STORY AND IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE TO START AT THE END BECAUSE
MarcusByrne_2012X@55.42:67.36 THIS IS A WASTE PRODUCT THAT COMES OUT OF OTHER ANIMALS BUT IT STILL CONTAINS NUTRIENTS AND THERE ARE SUFFICIENT NUTRIENTS IN THERE FOR DUNG BEETLES BASICALLY TO MAKE A LIVING AND SO DUNG BEETLES EAT
MarcusByrne_2012X@86.09:101.23 SO ACCORDING TO DUNG BEETLES DUNG IS PRETTY GOOD UNLESS YOU 'RE PREPARED TO GET DUNG UNDER YOUR FINGERNAILS AND ROOT THROUGH THE DUNG ITSELF YOU 'LL NEVER SEE NINETY PERCENT OF THE DUNG BEETLE SPECIES BECAUSE THEY GO DIRECTLY INTO THE DUNG
MarcusByrne_2012X@101.29:118.48 STRAIGHT DOWN BELOW IT AND THEN THEY SHUTTLE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE DUNG AT THE SOIL SURFACE AND A NEST THEY MAKE UNDERGROUND SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO THEY DEAL WITH THIS MATERIAL AND MOST DUNG BEETLES ACTUALLY WRAP IT INTO A PACKAGE OF SOME SORT
MarcusByrne_2012X@118.48:121.86 TEN PERCENT OF THE SPECIES ACTUALLY MAKE A BALL
MarcusByrne_2012X@137.54:154.08 SO THIS IS A VERY PROUD OWNER OF A BEAUTIFUL DUNG BALL YOU CAN SEE IT 'S A MALE BECAUSE HE 'S GOT A LITTLE HAIR ON THE BACK OF HIS LEGS THERE AND HE 'S CLEARLY VERY PLEASED ABOUT WHAT HE 'S SITTING ON THERE AND THEN HE 'S ABOUT TO BECOME A VICTIM OF A VICIOUS SMASH AND GRAB
MarcusByrne_2012X@162.59:164.75 AND SO VALUABLE RESOURCES
MarcusByrne_2012X@164.75:177.16 HAVE TO BE LOOKED AFTER AND GUARDED IN A PARTICULAR WAY AND WE THINK THE REASON THEY ROLL THE BALLS AWAY IS BECAUSE OF THIS BECAUSE OF THE COMPETITION THAT IS INVOLVED IN GETTING HOLD OF THAT DUNG
MarcusByrne_2012X@177.16:188.23 SO THIS DUNG PAT WAS ACTUALLY WELL IT WAS A DUNG PAT FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE THIS PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN AND WE THINK IT 'S THE INTENSE COMPETITION THAT MAKES THE BEETLES
MarcusByrne_2012X@188.23:191.97 SO WELL ADAPTED TO ROLLING BALLS OF DUNG
MarcusByrne_2012X@197.92:217.72 ITS HEAD IS DOWN IT 'S WALKING BACKWARDS IT 'S THE MOST BIZARRE WAY TO ACTUALLY TRANSPORT YOUR FOOD IN ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION AND AT THE SAME TIME IT 'S GOT TO DEAL WITH THE HEAT THIS IS AFRICA IT 'S HOT SO WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU NOW ARE SOME OF THE EXPERIMENTS THAT MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUES HAVE USED
MarcusByrne_2012X@217.72:221.24 TO INVESTIGATE HOW DUNG BEETLES
MarcusByrne_2012X@221.4:223.05 DEAL WITH THESE PROBLEMS
MarcusByrne_2012X@223.17:225.72 SO WATCH THIS
MarcusByrne_2012X@230.29:235.43 THE FIRST IS HOW IT DEALS WITH THIS OBSTACLE THAT WE 'VE PUT IN ITS WAY SEE LOOK IT DOES A LITTLE DANCE
MarcusByrne_2012X@235.71:240.46 AND THEN IT CARRIES ON IN EXACTLY THE SAME DIRECTION THAT IT TOOK IN THE FIRST PLACE
MarcusByrne_2012X@246.04:262.45 SO CLEARLY THIS ANIMAL KNOWS WHERE IT 'S GOING AND IT KNOWS WHERE IT WANTS TO GO AND THAT 'S A VERY VERY IMPORTANT THING BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT YOU 'RE AT THE DUNG PILE YOU 'VE GOT THIS GREAT BIG PIE THAT YOU WANT TO GET AWAY FROM EVERYBODY ELSE AND THE QUICKEST WAY TO DO IT IS IN A STRAIGHT LINE
MarcusByrne_2012X@263.18:265.37 SO WE GAVE THEM SOME MORE TASKS
MarcusByrne_2012X@280.63:290.56 SO THIS ANIMAL HAS ACTUALLY HAD THE WHOLE WORLD TURNED UNDER ITS FEET IT 'S TURNED BY NINETY DEGREES BUT IT DOESN 'T FLINCH IT KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE IT WANTS TO GO AND IT HEADS OFF IN THAT PARTICULAR DIRECTION
MarcusByrne_2012X@291.24:304.79 SO OUR NEXT QUESTION THEN WAS HOW ARE THEY DOING THIS WHAT ARE THEY DOING AND THERE WAS A CUE THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO US IT WAS THAT EVERY NOW AND THEN THEY 'D CLIMB ON TOP OF THE BALL AND THEY 'D TAKE A LOOK AT THE WORLD AROUND
MarcusByrne_2012X@341.69:343.52 DOES IT DOES A LITTLE DOUBLE DANCE
MarcusByrne_2012X@344.68:349.05 AND THEN IT HEADS BACK IN EXACTLY THE SAME DIRECTION IT WENT IN THE FIRST
MarcusByrne_2012X@373.33:390.02 BUT THE SUN IS AT THE HORIZON OVER HERE AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN THE SUN IS AT THE HORIZON SAY IT 'S OVER ON THIS SIDE THERE IS A NORTH SOUTH A HUGE PATHWAY ACROSS THE SKY OF POLARIZED LIGHT THAT WE CAN 'T SEE THAT THE BEETLES CAN SEE
MarcusByrne_2012X@427.79:431.35 OKAY SO WHAT WE 'VE GOT SO FAR IS
MarcusByrne_2012X@449.98:452.35 AND IT WAS THIS PARTICULAR LITTLE BEHAVIOR THE DANCE
MarcusByrne_2012X@461.72:474.9 SO WHAT ARE THEY DOING WHEN THEY DO THIS DANCE HOW FAR CAN WE PUSH THEM BEFORE THEY WILL REORIENTATE THEMSELVES AND IN THIS EXPERIMENT HERE WHAT WE DID WAS WE FORCED THEM INTO A CHANNEL
MarcusByrne_2012X@475.54:484.5 AND YOU CAN SEE HE WASN 'T PARTICULARLY FORCED INTO THIS PARTICULAR CHANNEL AND WE GRADUALLY DISPLACED THE BEETLE BY ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES
MarcusByrne_2012X@526.04:538.48 BUSH WATCHING DUNG BEETLES ON NICE HOT DAYS WE NOTICED THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER BEHAVIOR ASSOCIATED WITH THE DANCE BEHAVIOR EVERY NOW AND THEN WHEN THEY CLIMB ON TOP OF THE BALL THEY WIPE THEIR FACE
MarcusByrne_2012X@540.78:543.75 AND YOU SEE HIM DO IT AGAIN
MarcusByrne_2012X@543.75:546.51 NOW WE THOUGHT NOW WHAT COULD BE GOING ON HERE
MarcusByrne_2012X@546.51:564.56 CLEARLY THE GROUND IS VERY HOT AND WHEN THE GROUND IS HOT THEY DANCE MORE OFTEN AND WHEN THEY DO THIS PARTICULAR DANCE THEY WIPE THE BOTTOM OF THEIR FACE AND WE THOUGHT THAT IT COULD BE A THERMOREGULATORY BEHAVIOR WE THOUGHT THAT MAYBE WHAT THEY 'RE DOING IS TRYING TO GET OFF THE HOT SOIL AND ALSO SPITTING ONTO THEIR FACE TO COOL THEIR HEAD DOWN
MarcusByrne_2012X@564.56:578.62 SO WHAT WE DID WAS DESIGN A COUPLE OF ARENAS ONE WAS HOT ONE WAS COLD WE SHADED THIS ONE WE LEFT THAT ONE HOT AND THEN WHAT WE DID WAS WE FILMED THEM WITH A THERMAL CAMERA SO WHAT YOU 'RE LOOKING AT HERE
MarcusByrne_2012X@601.21:607.13 AGAINST THE BACKGROUND SO THE BACKGROUND HERE IS AROUND ABOUT FIFTY DEGREES CENTIGRADE
MarcusByrne_2012X@626.25:643.18 AND MINE AND WHAT 'S OF INTEREST HERE IS THAT LITTLE BRAIN IS QUITE COOL BUT IF WE CONTRAST NOW WHAT HAPPENS IN A HOT ENVIRONMENT LOOK AT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SOIL IT 'S UP AROUND FIFTY FIVE TO SIXTY DEGREES CENTIGRADE WATCH HOW OFTEN THE BEETLE DANCES
MarcusByrne_2012X@643.99:648.18 AND LOOK AT ITS FRONT LEGS THEY 'RE ROARINGLY HOT
MarcusByrne_2012X@648.92:655.45 SO THE BALL LEAVES A LITTLE THERMAL SHADOW AND THE BEETLE CLIMBS ON TOP OF THE BALL AND WIPES ITS FACE
MarcusByrne_2012X@655.75:666.52 AND ALL THE TIME IT 'S TRYING TO COOL ITSELF DOWN WE THINK AND AVOID THE HOT SAND THAT IT 'S WALKING ACROSS AND WHAT WE DID THEN WAS PUT LITTLE BOOTS
MarcusByrne_2012X@675:678.15 AND IF YOU LOOK OVER HERE WITH BOOTS
MarcusByrne_2012X@730.69:733.68 THIS IS A DUNG BEETLE
MarcusByrne_2012X@736.56:747.5 CAN YOU SPOT THE DIFFERENCE THEY DON 'T NORMALLY GO THIS SLOWLY IT 'S IN SLOW MOTION BUT IT 'S WALKING FORWARDS AND IT 'S ACTUALLY TAKING A PELLET OF DRY DUNG WITH IT
MarcusByrne_2012X@747.9:753.11 THIS IS A DIFFERENT SPECIES IN THE SAME GENUS BUT EXACTLY THE SAME FORAGING BEHAVIOR
MarcusByrne_2012X@849.7:857.99 NOW THERE 'S TWO WAYS IT COULD BE DOING THAT AND WE CAN TEST THAT BY DISPLACING THE BEETLE TO A NEW POSITION WHEN IT 'S AT THE FORAGING SITE
MarcusByrne_2012X@868.69:883.24 AND WHAT IT 'S DOING HERE IF IT 'S USING PATH INTEGRATION IS IT 'S COUNTING ITS STEPS OR MEASURING THE DISTANCE OUT IN THIS DIRECTION IT KNOWS THE BEARING HOME AND IT KNOWS IT SHOULD BE IN THAT DIRECTION IF YOU DISPLACE IT IT ENDS UP IN THE WRONG PLACE SO LET 'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS
MarcusByrne_2012X@883.24:891.07 WHEN WE PUT THIS BEETLE TO THE TEST WITH A SIMILAR EXPERIMENT SO HERE 'S OUR CUNNING EXPERIMENTER
MarcusByrne_2012X@891.99:897.41 HE DISPLACES THE BEETLE AND NOW WE HAVE TO SEE
MarcusByrne_2012X@897.41:899.39 WHAT IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE
MarcusByrne_2012X@902.8:920.6 THE FORAGE HAS BEEN DISPLACED TO A NEW POSITION IF HE 'S USING LANDMARK ORIENTATION HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND THE BURROW BECAUSE HE 'LL BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE LANDMARKS AROUND IT IF HE 'S USING PATH INTEGRATION THEN IT SHOULD END UP IN THE WRONG SPOT OVER HERE SO LET 'S WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
MarcusByrne_2012X@935.1:937.6 IT HASN 'T A CLUE
MarcusByrne_2012X@937.6:943.28 IT STARTS TO SEARCH FOR ITS HOUSE IN THE RIGHT DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE FOOD
MarcusByrne_2012X@951.32:956.21 TO FIND ITS WAY AROUND AND THE CALLOUS EXPERIMENTER LEADS IT
MarcusByrne_2012X@961.9:966.7 THAT USE A COMPASS AND THEY USE THE SUN AS A COMPASS TO FIND THEIR WAY AROUND AND
MarcusByrne_2012X@966.7:984.2 THEY HAVE SOME SORT OF SYSTEM FOR MEASURING THAT DISTANCE AND WE KNOW THAT THESE SPECIES HERE ACTUALLY COUNT THE STEPS THAT 'S WHAT THEY USE AS AN ODOMETER A STEP COUNTING SYSTEM TO FIND THEIR WAY BACK HOME WE DON 'T KNOW YET WHAT DUNG BEETLES USE
MarcusByrne_2012X@984.2:989.54 SO WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED FROM THESE ANIMALS WITH A BRAIN THAT 'S THE SIZE OF A GRAIN OF RICE
MarcusByrne_2012X@989.54:995.66 WELL WE KNOW THAT THEY CAN ROLL BALLS IN A STRAIGHT LINE USING CELESTIAL CUES
MarcusByrne_2012X@995.66:1013.74 WE KNOW THAT THE DANCE BEHAVIOR IS AN ORIENTATION BEHAVIOR AND IT 'S ALSO A THERMOREGULATION BEHAVIOR AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEY USE A PATH INTEGRATION SYSTEM FOR FINDING THEIR WAY HOME SO FOR A SMALL ANIMAL DEALING WITH A FAIRLY REVOLTING SUBSTANCE WE CAN ACTUALLY LEARN AN AWFUL LOT
MarcusByrne_2012X@1013.74:1018.21 FROM THESE THINGS DOING BEHAVIORS THAT YOU AND I COULDN 'T POSSIBLY DO
