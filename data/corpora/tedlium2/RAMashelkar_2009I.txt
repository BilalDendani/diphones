RAMashelkar_2009I@82.50:90.48 THEY CAN'T AFFORD ANYTHING MORE THAN THE SCOOTER THE ISSUE IS AT THAT PRICE CAN YOU GIVE THEM SOME EXTRA VALUE
RAMashelkar_2009I@91.14:99.94 A SUPER VALUE IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO RIDE IN A CAR TO GET THAT DIGNITY TO GET THAT SAFETY LOOKS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE ISN'T IT
RAMashelkar_2009I@100.85:113.10 NOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SEE ON INDIAN STREETS ALL THE TIME BUT MANY PEOPLE SEE THE SAME THING AND THINK THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND ONE OF THEM IS HERE

RAMashelkar_2009I@272.89:274.58 TOLD THEM QUESTION
RAMashelkar_2009I@278.55:285.93 AND AT A POINT IN TIME HE GOT SO ENGROSSED IN THE WHOLE CHALLENGE THAT HE HIMSELF BECAME A MEMBER OF THE TEAM CAN YOU BELIEVE IT
RAMashelkar_2009I@286.45:296.12 I STILL AM TOLD ABOUT THIS STORY OF THAT SINGLE WIPER DESIGN IN WHICH HE PARTICIPATED UNTIL MIDNIGHT HE'D BE THINKING EARLY MORNING HE'LL BE COMING BACK WITH SORT OF SOLUTIONS
RAMashelkar_2009I@298.02:306.36 THE TEAM LEADER WAS GIRISH WAGH A THIRTY FOUR YEAR OLD BOY IN AND THE NANO TEAM AVERAGE AGE WAS JUST TWENTY SEVEN YEARS
RAMashelkar_2009I@307.13:319.35 AND THEY DID INNOVATION IN DESIGN AND BEYOND BROKE MANY NORMS OF THE STANDARD CONVENTIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR EXAMPLE THAT A TWO CYLINDER GAS ENGINE WAS USED IN A CAR WITH A

RAMashelkar_2009I@343.97:353.88 SEEKING SOLUTIONS FOR NON AUTO SECTORS IT WAS AN OPEN INNOVATION IDEAS FROM ALL OVER WERE WELCOME THE MECHANISM OF HELICOPTERS SEATS AND WINDOWS WAS USED BY THE WAY
RAMashelkar_2009I@354.30:362.07 AS WELL AS A DASHBOARD THAT WAS INSPIRED BY TWO WHEELERS THE FUEL LINES AND LAMPS WERE AS IN TWO WHEELERS AND
RAMashelkar_2009I@374.75:388.38 AND THEREFORE EACH COMPONENT HAD TO HAVE A DUAL FUNCTIONALITY AND THE SEAT RISER FOR EXAMPLE SERVING AS A MOUNTING FOR THE SEAT AS WELL AS A STRUCTURAL PART OF THE FUNCTIONAL RIGIDITY HALF THE NUMBER OF
RAMashelkar_2009I@390.32:402.71 CONTAINED IN NANO IN COMPARISON TO A TYPICAL PASSENGER CAR THE LENGTH IS SMALLER BY EIGHT PERCENT BY THE WAY BUT THE CURRENT ENTRY LEVEL CARS IN COMPARISON TO THAT IS EIGHT PERCENT LESS BUT TWENTY ONE PERCENT MORE INSIDE
RAMashelkar_2009I@403.88:408.59 SPACE AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT
RAMashelkar_2009I@408.77:418.74 MORE FROM LESS YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH MORE FOR HOW MUCH LESS WHEN THE MODEL T WAS LAUNCHED AND THIS IS BY THE WAY ALL THE FIGURES THAT ARE ADJUSTED TO TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN DOLLAR PRICES
RAMashelkar_2009I@420.18:428.50 WAS NINETEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED BY FORD VOLKSWAGON WAS ELEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE AND BRITISH MOTOR WAS AROUND ELEVEN THOUSAND

RAMashelkar_2009I@467.63:480.88 PARKING THAT CAR ALONG WITH THE OWNER 'S CAR BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY'VE CREATED A SPACE IN THEIR MIND THAT YES MY CHAUFFEUR IS GOING TO COME IN HIS OWN CAR AND PARK IT AND THAT'S WHY I CALL IT A TRANSFORMATIONAL INNOVATION
RAMashelkar_2009I@481.40:486.25 IT IS NOT JUST TECHNOLOGICAL IT IS SOCIAL INNOVATION
RAMashelkar_2009I@486.39:491.84 THAT WE TALK ABOUT AND THAT IS WHERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS FAMOUS
RAMashelkar_2009I@492.57:505.49 OF GETTING MORE FROM LESS FOR MORE BECOMES IMPORTANT I REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN AUSTRALIA ABOUT ONE AND A HALF YEARS AGO WHEN THEIR ACADEMY HONORED ME WITH A FELLOWSHIP
RAMashelkar_2009I@516.54:530.00 I TITLED THIS MORE FROM LESS FOR MORE AND MORE PEOPLE AS GANDHIAN ENGINEERING AND GANDHIAN ENGINEERING IN MY JUDGMENT IS THE ONE WHICH IS GOING TO TAKE THE WORLD FORWARD IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE NOT JUST FOR A FEW BUT FOR EVERYONE

RAMashelkar_2009I@788.03:798.25 ONCE SAID WHEN YOU WISH TO ACHIEVE RESULTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ACHIEVED BEFORE IT IS AN UNWISE FANCY TO THINK THAT THEY CAN BE ACHIEVED BY USING METHODS THAT HAVE BEEN USED BEFORE
RAMashelkar_2009I@815.34:821.69 FROM MEN TO MICE TO MEN NOT MOLECULE TO MICE TO MEN YOU KNOW AND THAT IS HOW THIS DIFFERENCE HAS COME AND YOU CAN SEE

RAMashelkar_2009I@1067.30:1078.97 BUT IT WAS A POOR SCHOOL WITH RICH TEACHERS HONESTLY AND ONE OF THEM WAS WHO TAUGHT US PHYSICS ONE DAY HE TOOK US OUT INTO THE SUN AND TRIED TO SHOW US HOW TO FIND THE FOCAL LENGTH OF
RAMashelkar_2009I@1080.69:1091.20 THE LENS WAS HERE THE PIECE OF PAPER WAS THERE HE MOVED IT UP AND DOWN AND THERE WAS A BRIGHT SPOT UP THERE AND THEN HE SAID THIS IS THE FOCAL LENGTH BUT THEN HE HELD IT FOR A LITTLE WHILE LAKSHMI
RAMashelkar_2009I@1105.70:1112.13 ME A GREAT MESSAGE FOCUS AND YOU CAN ACHIEVE I SAID WHOA SCIENCE IS SO WONDERFUL I HAVE TO BECOME A SCIENTIST
RAMashelkar_2009I@1112.37:1120.92 BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOCUS AND YOU CAN ACHIEVE AND THAT MESSAGE VERY FRANKLY IS VALUABLE FOR SOCIETY TODAY WHAT DOES THAT FOCAL LENGTH
RAMashelkar_2009I@1123.15:1129.21 IT HAS PARALLEL LINES WHICH ARE SUN RAYS AND THE PROPERTY OF PARALLEL LINES IS THAT THEY NEVER MEET
RAMashelkar_2009I@1140.70:1146.48 SO I LEARNED THE LESSON OF CONVEX LENS LEADERSHIP FROM THAT AND WHEN I WAS AT NATIONAL
