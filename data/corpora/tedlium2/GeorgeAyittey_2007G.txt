GeorgeAyittey_2007G@70.13:83.00 GENERATION IS A NEW BREED OF AFRICANS WHO BROOK NO NONSENSE ABOUT CORRUPTION THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT ACCOUNTABILITY AND DEMOCRACY IS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WAIT FOR GOVERNMENT TO DO THINGS FOR THEM
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@84.59:89.44 THE CHEETAH GENERATION AND AFRICA 'S SALVATION RESTS ON THE BACKS OF THESE
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@91.24:94.25 IN CONTRAST OF COURSE WE HAVE THE HIPPO GENERATION
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@97.28:104.00 THE HIPPO GENERATION ARE THE RULING ELITES THEY ARE STUCK IN THEIR INTELLECTUAL PATCH
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@109.32:116.97 ONE FOOT IF YOU ASK THEM TO REFORM THE ECONOMIES THEY'RE NOT GOING TO REFORM IT BECAUSE THEY BENEFIT FROM THE ROTTEN STATUS
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@118.04:128.23 NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF AFRICANS WHO ARE VERY ANGRY ANGRY AT THE CONDITION OF AFRICA NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CONTINENT WHICH IS NOT

GeorgeAyittey_2007G@159.93:170.34 WHO WANT TO HELP THE PEOPLE IN AFRICA THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND NOW WE'RE NOT SAYING DON'T HELP AFRICA HELPING AFRICA IS NOBLE
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@171.35:179.57 BUT HELPING AFRICA HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A THEATER OF THE ABSURD IT'S LIKE THE BLIND LEADING

GeorgeAyittey_2007G@247.51:251.51 JUST ADD THAT UP ALL THESE LEAKAGES THAT'S FAR MORE THAN THE
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@251.98:261.60 FIFTY BILLION TONY BLAIR WANTS TO RAISE FOR AFRICA NOW BACK IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AFRICA NOT ONLY FED ITSELF IT ALSO EXPORTED FOOD NOT ANYMORE

GeorgeAyittey_2007G@277.79:285.27 AND FLIP OVER TO THE NEXT CHAPTER AND THAT'S WHAT THIS CONFERENCE IS ALL ABOUT THE NEXT CHAPTER
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@285.48:287.73 THE NEXT CHAPTER BEGINS
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@289.46:291.73 ASKING OURSELVES THIS FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@293.04:301.04 DO WE WANT TO HELP IN AFRICA THERE IS THE PEOPLE AND THEN THERE IS THE GOVERNMENT OR
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@303.67:304.92 NOW
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@306.27:310.85 THE SPEAKER BEFORE ME THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER BEFORE ME IDRIS MOHAMMED
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@312.98:315.25 INDICATED THAT
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@329.92:335.35 I BELONG TO AN INTERNET DISCUSSION FORUM AN AFRICAN INTERNET DISCUSSION FORUM
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@350.40:360.35 JUST TWENTY GOOD LEADERS MAYBE YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE THIS LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE YOURSELF I ASKED THEM TO NAME ME JUST TWENTY
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@380.10:382.71 THEY COULDN'T GO BEYOND FIFTEEN
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@385.36:393.11 EVEN IF THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO NAME ME TWENTY WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU TWENTY OUT OF TWO HUNDRED AND FOUR
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@394.40:407.91 THAT THE MAJORITY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE AFRICAN LEADERS FAILED THEIR PEOPLE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THEM THE SLATE OF THE POST COLONIAL LEADERS
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@408.20:418.13 AN ASSORTMENT OF MILITARY FUFU HEADS SWISS BANK SOCIALISTS CROCODILE LIBERATORS VAMPIRE ELITES QUACK REVOLUTIONARIES
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@421.70:427.25 NOW THIS LEADERSHIP IS A FAR CRY FROM THE TRADITIONAL LEADERS THAT AFRICANS HAVE KNOWN FOR CENTURIES
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@465.09:469.95 WHAT YOU AND I UNDERSTAND AS A GOVERNMENT DOESN'T EXIST IN MANY AFRICAN
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@471.45:486.02 WHAT WHAT WE CALL OUR GOVERNMENTS ARE VAMPIRE STATES VAMPIRES BECAUSE THEY SUCK THE ECONOMIC VITALITY OUT OF THEIR PEOPLE GOVERNMENT IS THE PROBLEM IN AFRICA
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@486.24:500.88 A VAMPIRE STATE IS THE GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS BEEN HIJACKED BY A PHALANX OF BANDITS AND CROOKS WHO USE THE INSTRUMENTS OF STATE POWER TO ENRICH THEMSELVES THEIR CRONIES AND TRIBESMEN AND EXCLUDE EVERYBODY ELSE
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@502.42:509.93 THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN AFRICA ARE HEADS OF STATE AND MINISTERS AND QUITE OFTEN THE CHIEF BANDIT IS THE HEAD OF STATE HIMSELF
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@512.31:512.92 WHERE DO THEY GET
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@514.92:525.49 BY CREATING WEALTH NO BY RAKING IT OFF THE BACKS OF THEIR SUFFERING PEOPLE THAT'S NOT WEALTH CREATION IT'S WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@526.91:539.28 THE THIRD FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT IF WE WANT TO HELP THE AFRICAN PEOPLE WE MUST KNOW WHERE THE AFRICAN PEOPLE ARE
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@540.21:547.53 TAKE ANY AFRICAN ECONOMY AN AFRICAN ECONOMY CAN BE BROKEN UP INTO THREE SECTORS THERE IS THE MODERN SECTOR
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@549.28:561.56 THERE IS THE INFORMAL SECTOR AND THE TRADITIONAL SECTOR THE MODERN SECTOR IS THE ABODE OF THE ELITES IT'S THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@562.63:576.05 MANY AFRICAN COUNTRIES THE MODERN SECTOR IS LOST IT'S DYSFUNCTIONAL IT IS A MERETRICIOUS FANDANGO OF IMPORTED SYSTEMS WHICH THE ELITES THEMSELVES DON'T UNDERSTAND
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@576.22:585.42 THAT IS THE SOURCE OF MANY OF AFRICA 'S PROBLEMS WHERE THE STRUGGLES FOR POLITICAL POWER EMANATE AND THEN SPILL OVER
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@586.15:595.87 THE INFORMAL AND THE TRADITIONAL SECTOR CLAIMING INNOCENT LIVES NOW THE MODERN SECTOR OF COURSE IS
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@596.77:601.83 THE DEVELOPMENT AID AND RESOURCES WENT INTO
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@606.42:609.06 THE OTHER SECTORS THE INFORMAL
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@625.40:632.84 WHAT WE DID AS A MATTER OF FACT WE NEGLECTED THE INFORMAL AND
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@633.21:642.42 THE TRADITIONAL SECTORS NOW TRADITIONAL SECTOR IS WHERE AFRICA PRODUCES ITS AGRICULTURE WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY AFRICA CAN'T FEED ITSELF
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@654.20:663.82 AND YOU CAN'T DEVELOP THE INFORMAL AND THE TRADITIONAL SECTORS WITHOUT AN OPERATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE TWO SECTORS
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@666.45:674.24 THESE TWO SECTORS LET ME DESCRIBE TO YOU HAVE THEIR OWN INDIGENOUS INSTITUTIONS FIRST ONE IS THE POLITICAL SYSTEM
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@686.47:699.69 THE FIRST ONE BELONGS TO THOSE ETHNIC SOCIETIES WHO BELIEVE THAT THE STATE WAS NECESSARILY TYRANNOUS SO THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ANY CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@713.55:723.03 SURE THAT THEY SURROUNDED THE CHIEFS WITH COUNCILS UPON COUNCILS UPON COUNCILS TO PREVENT THEM FROM ABUSING THEIR POWER
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@736.52:744.23 AND IF THE CHIEF DOESN'T GOVERN ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE HE WILL BE REMOVED IF NOT THE PEOPLE WILL ABANDON THE CHIEF
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@745.68:754.82 SET UP A NEW SETTLEMENT AND EVEN IF YOU LOOK IN ANCIENT AFRICAN EMPIRES THEY WERE ALL ORGANIZED AROUND ONE PARTICULAR
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@759.88:767.60 A GREAT DEAL OF DEVOLUTION OF AUTHORITY DECENTRALIZATION OF POWER NOW THIS IS WHAT I HAVE DESCRIBED TO YOU THIS IS
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@767.97:779.29 PART OF AFRICA 'S INDIGENOUS POLITICAL HERITAGE NOW COMPARE THAT TO THE MODERN SYSTEMS THE RULING ELITES ESTABLISHED ON AFRICA IT IS A TOTAL FAR CRY
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@780.42:786.71 THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM IN TRADITIONAL AFRICA THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@795.72:803.26 THE AMERICAN WILL SAY I AM BECAUSE I AM AND I CAN DAMN WELL DO ANYTHING I WANT ANYTIME THE ACCENT IS ON THE
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@804.43:812.06 IN AFRICA THE AFRICANS SAY I AM BECAUSE WE ARE THE WE CONNOTES COMMUNITY THE EXTENDED FAMILY SYSTEM
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@828.23:834.49 ON MARKETPLACES WHEN THEY MAKE A PROFIT IT IS THEIRS TO KEEP NOT FOR THE CHIEF TO SEQUESTER IT FROM
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@837.05:848.57 WHAT WE HAD IN TRADITIONAL AFRICA WAS A FREE MARKET SYSTEM THERE WERE MARKETS IN AFRICA BEFORE THE COLONIALISTS STEPPED FOOT ON THE CONTINENT TIMBUKTU WAS ONE GREAT BIG MARKET TOWN KANO SALAGA THEY WERE ALL THERE
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@849.25:862.17 TO WEST AFRICA YOU NOTICE THAT MARKET ACTIVITY IN WEST AFRICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN DOMINATED BY WOMEN SO IT'S QUITE APPROPRIATE THAT THIS SECTION IS CALLED A MARKETPLACE THE MARKET IS NOT ALIEN TO AFRICA
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@863.01:870.64 WHAT AFRICANS PRACTICED WAS A DIFFERENT FORM OF CAPITALISM BUT THEN AFTER INDEPENDENCE ALL OF A SUDDEN MARKETS
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@880.93:892.67 AND EVEN THEN WHAT KIND OF SOCIALISM DID THEY PRACTICE THE SOCIALISM THAT THEY PRACTICED WAS A PECULIAR FORM OF SWISS BANK SOCIALISM WHICH ALLOWED THE HEADS OF STATES AND THE MINISTERS TO RAPE AND
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@902.51:913.31 TO AFRICA 'S INDIGENOUS INSTITUTIONS AND THIS IS WHERE WE CHARGE THE CHEETAHS TO GO INTO THE INFORMAL SECTORS THE TRADITIONAL SECTORS THAT'S WHERE YOU FIND THE AFRICAN PEOPLE
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@913.49:922.89 AND I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU A QUICK LITTLE VIDEO ABOUT THE INFORMAL SECTOR ABOUT THE BOAT BUILDING THAT I MYSELF TRIED TO MOBILIZE AFRICANS IN THE
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@923.85:926.59 TO INVEST IN COULD YOU PLEASE SHOW THAT
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@978.54:980.54 ALSO MEANS THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@984.51:985.71 WHAT ECONOMISTS
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@994.92:995.24 SO THAT
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@1019.33:1031.47 THE TRADITIONAL MEDICINE AREA THIS IS WHERE WE NEED TO MOBILIZE AFRICANS IN THE DIASPORA ESPECIALLY TO INVEST IN THIS WE ALSO NEED TO MOBILIZE AFRICANS IN THE DIASPORA NOT ONLY TO GO INTO THE TRADITIONAL
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@1031.93:1042.35 SECTORS ALSO BUT TO GO INTO AGRICULTURE AND ALSO TO INSTIGATE CHANGE FROM WITHIN WE WERE ABLE TO MOBILIZE GHANAIANS IN
GeorgeAyittey_2007G@1049.12:1055.41 WITH THE CHEETAHS WE CAN TAKE AFRICA BACK ONE VILLAGE AT A TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH
