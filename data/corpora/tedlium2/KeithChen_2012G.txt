KeithChen_2012G@35.22:45.36 NOW MANY BRILLIANT ECONOMISTS HAVE SPENT THEIR ENTIRE LIVES WORKING ON THIS QUESTION AND AS A FIELD WE 'VE MADE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HEADWAY AND WE UNDERSTAND A LOT ABOUT THIS
KeithChen_2012G@45.36:62.08 WHAT I 'M HERE TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT TODAY IS AN INTRIGUING NEW HYPOTHESIS AND SOME SURPRISINGLY POWERFUL NEW FINDINGS THAT I 'VE BEEN WORKING ON ABOUT THE LINK BETWEEN THE STRUCTURE OF THE LANGUAGE YOU SPEAK AND HOW YOU FIND YOURSELF WITH THE PROPENSITY TO SAVE
KeithChen_2012G@62.08:76.01 LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SAVINGS RATES A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LANGUAGE AND THEN I 'LL DRAW THAT CONNECTION LET 'S START BY THINKING ABOUT THE MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE OECD OR THE ORGANIZATION OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT
KeithChen_2012G@89.64:105.91 DESPITE ALL OF THESE SIMILARITIES WE SEE HUGE DIFFERENCES IN SAVINGS BEHAVIOR SO ALL THE WAY OVER ON THE LEFT OF THIS GRAPH WHAT YOU SEE IS MANY OECD COUNTRIES SAVING OVER A QUARTER OF THEIR GDP EVERY YEAR AND SOME OECD COUNTRIES SAVING OVER A THIRD OF THEIR GDP PER YEAR
KeithChen_2012G@105.91:110.86 HOLDING DOWN THE RIGHT FLANK OF THE OECD ALL THE WAY ON THE OTHER SIDE IS GREECE
KeithChen_2012G@110.86:123.96 AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS GREECE HAS BARELY MANAGED TO SAVE MORE THAN TEN PERCENT OF THEIR GDP IT SHOULD BE NOTED OF COURSE THAT THE UNITED STATES AND THE U K ARE THE NEXT IN LINE
KeithChen_2012G@123.96:143.83 NOW THAT WE SEE THESE HUGE DIFFERENCES IN SAVINGS RATES HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT LANGUAGE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THESE DIFFERENCES LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW LANGUAGES FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFER LINGUISTS AND COGNITIVE SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN EXPLORING THIS QUESTION FOR MANY YEARS NOW AND THEN I 'LL DRAW THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THESE TWO BEHAVIORS
KeithChen_2012G@143.83:156.84 MANY OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY ALREADY NOTICED THAT I 'M CHINESE I GREW UP IN THE MIDWEST OF THE UNITED STATES AND SOMETHING I REALIZED QUITE EARLY ON WAS THAT THE CHINESE LANGUAGE FORCED ME TO SPEAK ABOUT AND IN FACT
KeithChen_2012G@157.39:169.75 MORE FUNDAMENTALLY THAN THAT EVER SO SLIGHTLY FORCED ME TO THINK ABOUT FAMILY IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS NOW HOW MIGHT THAT BE LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE SUPPOSE I WERE TALKING WITH YOU AND I WAS INTRODUCING YOU TO MY UNCLE
KeithChen_2012G@169.75:187.99 YOU UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY WHAT I JUST SAID IN ENGLISH IF WE WERE SPEAKING MANDARIN CHINESE WITH EACH OTHER THOUGH I WOULDN 'T HAVE THAT LUXURY I WOULDN 'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONVEY SO LITTLE INFORMATION WHAT MY LANGUAGE WOULD HAVE FORCED ME TO DO INSTEAD OF JUST TELLING YOU THIS IS MY UNCLE IS TO TELL YOU A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
KeithChen_2012G@187.99:193.54 MY LANGUAGE WOULD FORCE ME TO TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT THIS WAS AN UNCLE ON MY MOTHER 'S SIDE OR MY FATHER 'S SIDE
KeithChen_2012G@210.94:223.19 NOW THAT FASCINATED ME ENDLESSLY AS A CHILD BUT WHAT FASCINATES ME EVEN MORE TODAY AS AN ECONOMIST IS THAT SOME OF THESE SAME DIFFERENCES CARRY THROUGH TO HOW LANGUAGES SPEAK ABOUT TIME
KeithChen_2012G@223.19:234.84 SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I 'M SPEAKING IN ENGLISH I HAVE TO SPEAK GRAMMATICALLY DIFFERENTLY IF I 'M TALKING ABOUT PAST RAIN IT RAINED YESTERDAY CURRENT RAIN IT IS RAINING NOW OR FUTURE RAIN IT WILL RAIN TOMORROW
KeithChen_2012G@234.84:250.55 NOTICE THAT ENGLISH REQUIRES A LOT MORE INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE TIMING OF EVENTS WHY BECAUSE I HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT AND I HAVE TO MODIFY WHAT I 'M SAYING TO SAY IT WILL RAIN OR IT 'S GOING TO RAIN IT 'S SIMPLY NOT PERMISSIBLE IN ENGLISH TO SAY IT RAIN TOMORROW
KeithChen_2012G@250.55:254.76 IN CONTRAST TO THAT THAT 'S ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD SAY IN CHINESE
KeithChen_2012G@254.76:274.47 A CHINESE SPEAKER CAN BASICALLY SAY SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS VERY STRANGE TO AN ENGLISH SPEAKER 'S EARS THEY CAN SAY YESTERDAY IT RAIN NOW IT RAIN TOMORROW IT RAIN IN SOME DEEP SENSE CHINESE DOESN 'T DIVIDE UP THE TIME SPECTRUM IN THE SAME WAY THAT ENGLISH FORCES US TO CONSTANTLY DO IN ORDER TO SPEAK CORRECTLY
KeithChen_2012G@274.47:285.08 IS THIS DIFFERENCE IN LANGUAGES ONLY BETWEEN VERY VERY DISTANTLY RELATED LANGUAGES LIKE ENGLISH AND CHINESE ACTUALLY NO SO MANY OF YOU KNOW IN THIS ROOM THAT ENGLISH IS A GERMANIC LANGUAGE
KeithChen_2012G@285.08:303.76 WHAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE REALIZED IS THAT ENGLISH IS ACTUALLY AN OUTLIER IT IS THE ONLY GERMANIC LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES THIS FOR EXAMPLE MOST OTHER GERMANIC LANGUAGE SPEAKERS FEEL COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT RAIN TOMORROW BY SAYING MORGEN REGNET ES QUITE LITERALLY TO AN ENGLISH EAR IT RAIN TOMORROW
KeithChen_2012G@303.76:318.7 THIS LED ME AS A BEHAVIORAL ECONOMIST TO AN INTRIGUING HYPOTHESIS COULD HOW YOU SPEAK ABOUT TIME COULD HOW YOUR LANGUAGE FORCES YOU TO THINK ABOUT TIME AFFECT YOUR PROPENSITY TO BEHAVE ACROSS TIME YOU SPEAK ENGLISH
KeithChen_2012G@318.71:337.27 A FUTURED LANGUAGE AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT EVERY TIME YOU DISCUSS THE FUTURE OR ANY KIND OF A FUTURE EVENT GRAMMATICALLY YOU 'RE FORCED TO CLEAVE THAT FROM THE PRESENT AND TREAT IT AS IF IT 'S SOMETHING VISCERALLY DIFFERENT NOW SUPPOSE THAT THAT VISCERAL DIFFERENCE MAKES YOU SUBTLY DISSOCIATE THE FUTURE FROM THE PRESENT EVERY TIME YOU SPEAK
KeithChen_2012G@337.27:344.74 IF THAT 'S TRUE AND IT MAKES THE FUTURE FEEL LIKE SOMETHING MORE DISTANT AND MORE DIFFERENT FROM THE PRESENT THAT 'S GOING TO MAKE IT HARDER TO SAVE
KeithChen_2012G@344.74:356.31 IF ON THE OTHER HAND YOU SPEAK A FUTURELESS LANGUAGE THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE YOU SPEAK ABOUT THEM IDENTICALLY IF THAT SUBTLY NUDGES YOU TO FEEL ABOUT THEM IDENTICALLY THAT 'S GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER TO SAVE
KeithChen_2012G@356.31:362.97 NOW THIS IS A FANCIFUL THEORY I 'M A PROFESSOR I GET PAID TO HAVE FANCIFUL THEORIES
KeithChen_2012G@362.97:379.71 BUT HOW WOULD YOU ACTUALLY GO ABOUT TESTING SUCH A THEORY WELL WHAT I DID WITH THAT WAS TO ACCESS THE LINGUISTICS LITERATURE AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THERE ARE POCKETS OF FUTURELESS LANGUAGE SPEAKERS SITUATED ALL OVER THE WORLD THIS IS A POCKET OF FUTURELESS LANGUAGE SPEAKERS IN NORTHERN EUROPE
KeithChen_2012G@379.71:389.98 INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WHEN YOU START TO CRANK THE DATA THESE POCKETS OF FUTURELESS LANGUAGE SPEAKERS ALL AROUND THE WORLD TURN OUT TO BE BY AND LARGE SOME OF THE WORLD 'S BEST SAVERS
KeithChen_2012G@389.98:395.28 JUST TO GIVE YOU A HINT OF THAT LET 'S LOOK BACK AT THAT OECD GRAPH THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
KeithChen_2012G@395.28:414.01 WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT THESE BARS ARE SYSTEMATICALLY TALLER AND SYSTEMATICALLY SHIFTED TO THE LEFT COMPARED TO THESE BARS WHICH ARE THE MEMBERS OF THE OECD THAT SPEAK FUTURED LANGUAGES WHAT IS THE AVERAGE DIFFERENCE HERE FIVE PERCENTAGE POINTS OF YOUR GDP SAVED PER YEAR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS THAT HAS HUGE LONG RUN EFFECTS ON THE WEALTH OF YOUR NATION
KeithChen_2012G@414.01:423.17 NOW WHILE THESE FINDINGS ARE SUGGESTIVE COUNTRIES CAN BE DIFFERENT IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT IT 'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT SOMETIMES TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF THESE POSSIBLE DIFFERENCES
KeithChen_2012G@423.17:441.63 WHAT I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THOUGH IS SOMETHING THAT I 'VE BEEN ENGAGING IN FOR A YEAR WHICH IS TRYING TO GATHER ALL OF THE LARGEST DATASETS THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO AS ECONOMISTS AND I 'M GOING TO TRY AND STRIP AWAY ALL OF THOSE POSSIBLE DIFFERENCES HOPING TO GET THIS RELATIONSHIP TO BREAK AND JUST IN SUMMARY NO MATTER HOW FAR I PUSH THIS
KeithChen_2012G@461.42:470.72 SO IMAGINE THAT YOU 'RE A RETIRED HOUSEHOLD IN BELGIUM AND SOMEONE COMES TO YOUR FRONT DOOR EXCUSE ME WOULD YOU MIND IF I PERUSE YOUR STOCK PORTFOLIO
KeithChen_2012G@470.72:481.93 DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR HOUSE IS WORTH DO YOU MIND TELLING ME WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE A HALLWAY THAT 'S MORE THAN TEN METERS LONG IF YOU DO WOULD YOU MIND IF I TIMED HOW LONG IT TOOK YOU TO WALK DOWN THAT HALLWAY
KeithChen_2012G@481.93:491.33 WOULD YOU MIND SQUEEZING AS HARD AS YOU CAN IN YOUR DOMINANT HAND THIS DEVICE SO I CAN MEASURE YOUR GRIP STRENGTH HOW ABOUT BLOWING INTO THIS TUBE SO I CAN MEASURE YOUR LUNG CAPACITY
KeithChen_2012G@491.33:494.38 THE SURVEY TAKES OVER A DAY
KeithChen_2012G@512.26:523.12 COMBINE THAT WITH A WORLD VALUE SURVEY WHICH MEASURES THE POLITICAL OPINIONS AND FORTUNATELY FOR ME THE SAVINGS BEHAVIORS OF MILLIONS OF FAMILIES IN HUNDREDS OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD
KeithChen_2012G@523.12:536.01 TAKE ALL OF THAT DATA COMBINE IT AND THIS MAP IS WHAT YOU GET WHAT YOU FIND IS NINE COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT NATIVE POPULATIONS WHICH SPEAK BOTH FUTURELESS AND FUTURED LANGUAGES
KeithChen_2012G@536.01:544.32 AND WHAT I 'M GOING TO DO IS FORM STATISTICAL MATCHED PAIRS BETWEEN FAMILIES THAT ARE NEARLY IDENTICAL ON EVERY DIMENSION THAT I CAN MEASURE
KeithChen_2012G@544.32:552.38 AND THEN I 'M GOING TO EXPLORE WHETHER OR NOT THE LINK BETWEEN LANGUAGE AND SAVINGS HOLDS EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR ALL OF THESE LEVELS
KeithChen_2012G@552.38:565.16 WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS WE CAN CONTROL FOR WELL I 'M GOING TO MATCH FAMILIES ON COUNTRY OF BIRTH AND RESIDENCE THE DEMOGRAPHICS WHAT SEX THEIR AGE THEIR INCOME LEVEL WITHIN THEIR OWN COUNTRY THEIR EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT A LOT ABOUT THEIR FAMILY STRUCTURE
KeithChen_2012G@565.16:568.43 IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE SIX DIFFERENT WAYS TO BE MARRIED IN EUROPE
KeithChen_2012G@568.43:582.96 AND MOST GRANULARLY I BREAK THEM DOWN BY RELIGION WHERE THERE ARE SEVENTY TWO CATEGORIES OF RELIGIONS IN THE WORLD SO AN EXTREME LEVEL OF GRANULARITY THERE ARE ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DIFFERENT WAYS THAT A FAMILY CAN FIND ITSELF NOW
KeithChen_2012G@582.96:591.77 EFFECTIVELY EVERYTHING I 'M GOING TO TELL YOU FROM NOW ON IS ONLY COMPARING THESE BASICALLY NEARLY IDENTICAL FAMILIES IT 'S GETTING AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT
KeithChen_2012G@607.09:621.72 NOW EVEN AFTER ALL OF THIS GRANULAR LEVEL OF CONTROL DO FUTURELESS LANGUAGE SPEAKERS SEEM TO SAVE MORE YES FUTURELESS LANGUAGE SPEAKERS EVEN AFTER THIS LEVEL OF CONTROL ARE THIRTY PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO REPORT HAVING SAVED IN ANY GIVEN YEAR
KeithChen_2012G@621.72:633.7 DOES THIS HAVE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS YES BY THE TIME THEY RETIRE FUTURELESS LANGUAGE SPEAKERS HOLDING CONSTANT THEIR INCOME ARE GOING TO RETIRE WITH TWENTY FIVE PERCENT MORE IN SAVINGS CAN WE PUSH THIS DATA EVEN FURTHER
KeithChen_2012G@633.7:639.28 YES BECAUSE I JUST TOLD YOU WE ACTUALLY COLLECT A LOT OF HEALTH DATA AS ECONOMISTS NOW
KeithChen_2012G@639.28:654.8 HOW CAN WE THINK ABOUT HEALTH BEHAVIORS TO THINK ABOUT SAVINGS WELL THINK ABOUT SMOKING FOR EXAMPLE SMOKING IS IN SOME DEEP SENSE NEGATIVE SAVINGS IF SAVINGS IS CURRENT PAIN IN EXCHANGE FOR FUTURE PLEASURE SMOKING IS JUST THE OPPOSITE IT 'S CURRENT PLEASURE
KeithChen_2012G@654.81:661.22 IN EXCHANGE FOR FUTURE PAIN WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT THEN IS THE OPPOSITE EFFECT AND THAT 'S EXACTLY WHAT WE FIND
KeithChen_2012G@661.22:678.45 FUTURELESS LANGUAGE SPEAKERS ARE TWENTY TO TWENTY FOUR PERCENT LESS LIKELY TO BE SMOKING AT ANY GIVEN POINT IN TIME COMPARED TO IDENTICAL FAMILIES AND THEY 'RE GOING TO BE THIRTEEN TO SEVENTEEN PERCENT LESS LIKELY TO BE OBESE BY THE TIME THEY RETIRE AND THEY 'RE GOING TO REPORT BEING TWENTY ONE PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO HAVE USED A CONDOM IN THEIR LAST SEXUAL ENCOUNTER
KeithChen_2012G@678.45:688.28 I COULD GO ON AND ON WITH THE LIST OF DIFFERENCES THAT YOU CAN FIND IT 'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO FIND A SAVINGS BEHAVIOR FOR WHICH THIS STRONG EFFECT ISN 'T PRESENT
KeithChen_2012G@688.28:703.82 MY LINGUISTICS AND ECONOMICS COLLEAGUES AT YALE AND I ARE JUST STARTING TO DO THIS WORK AND REALLY EXPLORE AND UNDERSTAND THE WAYS THAT THESE SUBTLE NUDGES CAUSE US TO THINK MORE OR LESS ABOUT THE FUTURE EVERY SINGLE TIME WE SPEAK
KeithChen_2012G@703.82:716.19 ULTIMATELY THE GOAL ONCE WE UNDERSTAND HOW THESE SUBTLE EFFECTS CAN CHANGE OUR DECISION MAKING WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE PEOPLE TOOLS SO THAT THEY CAN CONSCIOUSLY MAKE THEMSELVES BETTER SAVERS
KeithChen_2012G@716.2:720.73 AND MORE CONSCIOUS INVESTORS IN THEIR OWN FUTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
