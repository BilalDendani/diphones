NathanMyhrvold_2007 SO
NathanMyhrvold_2007 I'M IN CHILE IN THE ATACAMA DESERT SITTING IN A HOTEL LOBBY BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE THAT I CAN GET A WI FI CONNECTION AND I HAVE THIS PICTURE UP ON MY SCREEN AND A WOMAN COMES UP BEHIND ME
NathanMyhrvold_2007 AND UNFORTUNATELY I CAN BE A LITTLE TOO HONEST I SAID NO IT'S IT'S PENGUIN SHIT
NathanMyhrvold_2007 AND YOU KNOW EXCUSE ME
NathanMyhrvold_2007 SENSE THAT SHE THOUGHT I WAS SPEAKING
NathanMyhrvold_2007 JUST BEEN IN THE FALKLAND ISLANDS TAKING PICTURES OF PENGUINS THIS IS A GENTOO PENGUIN AND SHE WAS STILL SKEPTICAL SO LITERALLY A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THAT I DOWNLOADED THIS SCIENTIFIC PAPER
NathanMyhrvold_2007 ABOUT CALCULATIONS ON AVIAN DEFECATION WHICH IS REALLY QUITE INTERESTING BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT
NathanMyhrvold_2007 YOU CAN MODEL THIS AS
NathanMyhrvold_2007 AT THIS POINT SHE STOPS ME
NathanMyhrvold_2007 WHAT DO YOU DO
NathanMyhrvold_2007 I WAS STUCK BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE ANY WAY TO DESCRIBE WHAT I DO
NathanMyhrvold_2007 AND SO IN SOME SENSE THIS TALK TODAY IS MY ANSWER TO THAT IT'S A SELECTION OF A RANDOM BUNCH OF THE STUFF THAT I DO
NathanMyhrvold_2007 IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME TO MAKE SENSE OF IT SO I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU CAN IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT I SIT UP LATE AT NIGHT THINKING ABOUT SOMETIMES OFTEN AT FOUR IN THE MORNING
NathanMyhrvold_2007 SO SOME PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF WHAT I DO
NathanMyhrvold_2007 SOME PEOPLE THINK I AM THE NERD TONY SOPRANO AND IN RESPONSE I HAVE ORDERED A BULLETPROOF POCKET PROTECTOR
NathanMyhrvold_2007 I'M NOT SURE WHAT THESE PEOPLE THINK BECAUSE I DON'T SPEAK NORSK
NathanMyhrvold_2007 BUT I'M NOT THINKING MONSTERET IS A GOOD THING
NathanMyhrvold_2007 YOU KNOW
NathanMyhrvold_2007 SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LOVE TO DO IS TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD AND LOOK AT ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES BECAUSE ARCHAEOLOGY GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY PAST CIVILIZATIONS AND SEE WHERE
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THEY SUCCEEDED AND WHERE THEY FAILED USE SCIENCE TO YOU KNOW WORK BACKWARDS AND SAY WELL REALLY WHAT WERE THEY THINKING
NathanMyhrvold_2007 AND RECENTLY I WAS IN EASTER ISLAND
NathanMyhrvold_2007 AN INCREDIBLY MYSTERIOUS PLACE BECAUSE NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO IN EASTER ISLAND YOU'RE STRUCK BY THESE STATUES CALLED THE MOAI
NathanMyhrvold_2007 SIXTY FOUR SQUARE MILES
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THEY MADE SO FAR AS WE CAN TELL NINE HUNDRED OF THEM
NathanMyhrvold_2007 WHY ON EARTH
NathanMyhrvold_2007 AND IF YOU HAVEN'T READ JARED DIAMOND 'S BOOK COLLAPSE I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO HE 'S A GOT A GREAT CHAPTER ABOUT IT BASICALLY THESE PEOPLE COMMITTED ECOLOGICAL SUICIDE IN ORDER TO MAKE MORE OF THESE
NathanMyhrvold_2007 AND
NathanMyhrvold_2007 CUT DOWN THE LAST TREE AND COMMIT SUICIDE BECAUSE WE NEED MORE IDENTICAL STATUES
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THAT LOOK ON THE FACE WHY THAT BROW I MEAN IT'S SUCH A POWERFUL THING WHERE DID THEY GET THAT INSPIRATION AND THEN I MET YOYO
NathanMyhrvold_2007 WHO IS THE NATIVE RAPA NUIAN GUIDE AND IF YOU LOOK AT YOYO 'S FACE YOU KIND OF FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY GOT
NathanMyhrvold_2007 MANY MYSTERIES THESE STATUES EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW HOW DID THEY MADE THEM HOW DID THEY TRANSPORT THEM
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THIS WOMAN IN THE FOREGROUND IS JO ANNE VAN TILBERG SHE'S THE LEADING ARCHAEOLOGIST WORKING EASTER ISLAND TODAY
NathanMyhrvold_2007 ONE INTERESTING PROBLEM IS THE STONE ISN'T VERY HARD SO THIS USED TO BE COMPLETELY SMOOTH
NathanMyhrvold_2007 AND WE'RE GOING TO DO A VERY HIGH RES DIGITIZATION FIRST BECAUSE IT'S A WAY OF PRESERVING THEM SECOND WE HAVE THESE IDEAS ABOUT HOW YOU CAN ALGORITHMICALLY THEN
NathanMyhrvold_2007 LEARN A FEW OF THE MYSTERIES ABOUT THEM HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN STANDING IN WHAT POSITIONS AND MAYBE INDIRECTLY GET AT SOME OF THE ISSUES OF WHAT CAUSED THEM TO BE THE WAY THEY ARE
NathanMyhrvold_2007 GET A GRATUITOUS PICTURE OF A MOAI WITH A COMET
NathanMyhrvold_2007 I ALSO HAVE AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT GOING ON IN EGYPT GOING ON IS PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT STRONG
NathanMyhrvold_2007 ANOTHER THING I DO IS I INVENT STUFF
NathanMyhrvold_2007 IN FACT I DESIGN NUCLEAR REACTORS
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THIS IS THE CONVENTIONAL NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE THE RED LINE IS WHAT IS DONE IN MOST NUCLEAR REACTORS IT'S CALLED THE OPEN FUEL CYCLE
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THE WHITE LINES ARE WHAT'S CALLED AN ADVANCE FUEL CYCLE WHERE YOU
NathanMyhrvold_2007 NOW THIS IS THE NORMAL WAY IT'S DONE IT'S GOT THE HUGE ADVANTAGE THAT IT DOES NOT CREATE CARBON POLLUTION IT HAS A LOT OF
NathanMyhrvold_2007 WHICH IS A PROBLEM SO OUR REACTOR ELIMINATES THESE STEPS
NathanMyhrvold_2007 WHICH IF WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE IT WORK IS A REALLY COOL THING
NathanMyhrvold_2007 IT'S THE KIND OF VERY HIGH RISK BUT POTENTIALLY VERY HIGH RETURN THING THAT WE DO
NathanMyhrvold_2007 A TOTALLY DIFFERENT FIELD WE DO A LOT OF STUFF IN SOLID STATE PHYSICS PARTICULARLY IN AN AREA CALLED METAMATERIALS
NathanMyhrvold_2007 A METAMATERIAL IS AN ARTIFICIAL MATERIAL WHICH MANIPULATES IN THIS CASE ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION IN A WAY THAT YOU COULDN'T OTHERWISE
NathanMyhrvold_2007 SO THIS DEVICE HERE IS AN INVISIBILITY CLOAK
NathanMyhrvold_2007 BUT IF YOU WERE A MICROWAVE
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THIS IS HOW YOU WOULD VIEW IT
NathanMyhrvold_2007 YOU COULD DO THAT WITH MIRRORS FROM ONE ANGLE THE COOL THING IS THIS DOES IT FROM ALL ANGLES
NathanMyhrvold_2007 IT'S YOU KNOW TODAY I'D LIKE TO SAY IT'S A ZERO BILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS BUT IN FACT IT'S NEGATIVE
NathanMyhrvold_2007 BUT SOME DAY SOME DAY MAYBE IT'S GOING TO WORK
NathanMyhrvold_2007 WE DO A LOT OF WORK IN BIOMEDICAL
NathanMyhrvold_2007 DISEASES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
NathanMyhrvold_2007 MY EYES BY THE WAY
NathanMyhrvold_2007 NOW I'M ALSO VERY INTERESTED IN COOKING WHILE I WAS AT MICROSOFT I TOOK A LEAVE OF ABSENCE AND WENT TO A CHEF SCHOOL IN FRANCE
NathanMyhrvold_2007 BUT BARBECUE 'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THESE CULT FOODS LIKE CHILI OR BOUILLABAISSE VARIOUS PARTS WILL HAVE A CULT FOOD THAT PEOPLE GET ENORMOUSLY ATTACHED TO
NathanMyhrvold_2007 IF THIS LOOKS MORE COMPLICATED THAN THE NUCLEAR REACTOR THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS
NathanMyhrvold_2007 BUT IF YOU GET TO PLAY WITH ALL THOSE KNOBS AND DIALS AND OF COURSE REALLY THE CONTROLLER OVER THERE DOES IT ALL ON SOFTWARE YOU CAN
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THIS IS A HIGH SPEED CENTRIFUGE YOU SHOULD ALL HAVE ONE IN YOUR KITCHEN BESIDE YOUR TURBOCHEF
NathanMyhrvold_2007 OH BOY DOES IT CLARIFY CHICKEN STOCK YOU WOULD NOT
NathanMyhrvold_2007 TURNS OUT A IT'S USEFUL AND FOR A GEEK LIKE ME IT'S FUN THEORY IS RED BLACK IS EXPERIMENT
NathanMyhrvold_2007 SO I'M EITHER REALLY GOOD AT FAKING IT OR OR THIS PARTICULAR MODEL SEEMS TO WORK
NathanMyhrvold_2007 SO ANOTHER RANDOM THING I DO IS THE SEARCH FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE OR SETI
NathanMyhrvold_2007 AND YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THE MOVIE CONTACT WHICH SORT OF POPULARIZED THAT IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE REAL PEOPLE WHO GO OUT AND SEARCH FOR EXTRATERRESTRIALS IN A VERY SCIENTIFIC WAY
NathanMyhrvold_2007 AND JILL HAS DEDICATED HER LIFE TO THIS
NathanMyhrvold_2007 BUT JILL HAS WHAT I CALL SLOW HEROISM
NathanMyhrvold_2007 RISKING HER PROFESSIONAL LIFE ON SOMETHING
NathanMyhrvold_2007 AND AFTERWARDS THEY CAME TO ME AND THEY SAID SO
NathanMyhrvold_2007 YOU KNOW THAT CREEPY RICH GUY IN THE MOVIE
NathanMyhrvold_2007 JUST A MOVIE COME ON
NathanMyhrvold_2007 SO THE SETI INSTITUTE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF HELP FROM ME AND A LOT OF HELP FROM PAUL ALLEN AND A VARIETY OF OTHER PEOPLE IS BUILDING A DEDICATED RADIO TELESCOPE IN HAT CREEK CALIFORNIA SO THEY CAN DO THIS SETI WORK
NathanMyhrvold_2007 CAN YOU IMAGINE E T S PHONING HOME AND I'M NOT LIKE
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THERE YOU KNOW HORRIBLE
NathanMyhrvold_2007 SO I DO A LOT OF WORK ON DINOSAURS I'M KNOWN TO TEDSTERS AS THE GUY THAT HAS SEX WITH DINOSAURS AND I RESEMBLE THAT REMARK
NathanMyhrvold_2007 TALK ABOUT A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF DINOSAURS WHICH IS THE FINDING OF
NathanMyhrvold_2007 NOW TO FIND DINOSAURS YOU HIKE AROUND IN HORRIBLE CONDITIONS
NathanMyhrvold_2007 ALWAYS FIND DINOSAURS IN DESERTS OR BADLANDS AREAS THAT HAVE VERY LITTLE PLANT GROWTH AND HAVE FLASH FLOODS IN THE SPRING YOU KNOW SKIERS PRAY FOR
NathanMyhrvold_2007 HIKE AROUND
NathanMyhrvold_2007 AND THIS IS AFTER YOU DIG THEM UP THEY LOOK LIKE THIS YOU HIKE AROUND YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS NOW THIS IS SOMETHING I FOUND SO LOOK AT IT VERY CLOSELY HERE
NathanMyhrvold_2007 YOU SAY WELL GEE THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING WHAT ARE ALL OF THESE PIECES
NathanMyhrvold_2007 CLOSELY YOU CAN RECOGNIZE ACTUALLY FROM THE SHAPE THAT THESE ARE SKULL FRAGMENTS
NathanMyhrvold_2007 A BIG SERRATION ON THE EDGE
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THIS IS WHAT TYRANNOSAURUS REX LOOKS LIKE IN THE GROUND
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO FIND A TYRANNOSAURUS REX
NathanMyhrvold_2007 WHICH I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO DO A FEW YEARS AGO
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THIS IS WHAT TYRANNOSAURUS REX LOOKS LIKE IN MY LIVING ROOM
NathanMyhrvold_2007 NOT THE SAME ONE ACTUALLY THIS IS A CAST WHICH I HAD BOUGHT AND THEN AFTER BUYING THE CAST I FOUND MY OWN AND I DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR TWO
NathanMyhrvold_2007 SO THE THING THAT'S WONDERFUL FOR ME ABOUT FINDING DINOSAURS IS THAT IT IS BOTH AN INTELLECTUAL THING BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO RECONSTRUCT THE ENVIRONMENT OF MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO
NathanMyhrvold_2007 IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN INFORM ALL SORTS OF SCIENCE IN UNEXPECTED WAYS THE STUDY OF DINOSAURS LED TO THE REALIZATION THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH ASTEROID IMPACT FOR EXAMPLE
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THE STUDY OF DINOSAURS MAY LITERALLY ONE DAY SAVE THE PLANET STUDY OF THE ANCIENT CLIMATE
NathanMyhrvold_2007 IS VERY IMPORTANT IN FACT THE MESOZOIC WHEN DINOSAURS LIVED HAD MUCH HIGHER CO TWO THAN TODAY WAS MUCH WARMER THAN TODAY AND IS ONE OF THE INTERESTING PROOF POINTS FOR THE EFFECTS OF CO TWO ON CLIMATE
NathanMyhrvold_2007 BUT BESIDES BEING INTELLECTUALLY AND SCIENTIFICALLY INTERESTING
NathanMyhrvold_2007 IS ACTUALLY WHAT MOST DINOSAUR RESEARCH LOOKS LIKE THIS IS ONE OF MY PAPERS A PYGOSTYLE FROM A NON AVIAN
NathanMyhrvold_2007 NOW I'M ALSO REALLY BIG ON PHOTOGRAPHY I TRAVEL ALL OVER THE WORLD TAKING PICTURES
NathanMyhrvold_2007 HERE 'S A PICTURE I TOOK IN THE FALKLAND ISLANDS
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THE LAST DAY THE SUN COMES OUT THE ORCAS COME THEY'RE RIGHT BY THE BOAT IT'S FANTASTIC AND I GET LOTS OF PICTURES LIKE THIS
NathanMyhrvold_2007 A LITTLE BIT LATER
NathanMyhrvold_2007 I START GETTING SOME PICTURES LIKE THIS
NathanMyhrvold_2007 NOW TO A HUMAN AUDIENCE I NEED TO EXPLAIN THAT
NathanMyhrvold_2007 IF PENTHOUSE MAGAZINE HAD A MARINE MAMMAL EDITION
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THIS WOULD BE THE CENTERFOLD
NathanMyhrvold_2007 MORE AND MORE ACTIVITY NEAR THE BOAT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMEBODY
NathanMyhrvold_2007 A VARIETY OF THINGS YOU CAN LEARN FROM WATCHING WHALES HAVE SEX
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THE FIRST THING YOU LEARN
NathanMyhrvold_2007 IS THE OVERWHELMING IMPORTANCE OF HANDS
NathanMyhrvold_2007 I THINK PAUL SIMON IS IN THE AUDIENCE AND HE HAS HE MAY NOT REALIZE IT BUT HE WROTE A SONG ALL ABOUT WHALE SEX
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THAT'S KIND OF WHAT IT'S LIKE
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THE OTHER INTERESTING THING THAT I LEARNED ABOUT WHALE SEX THEY CURL THEIR TOES TOO
NathanMyhrvold_2007 AND I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT I JUST YOU KNOW BECAUSE YES I'LL FOCUS PASSION ON SOMETHING
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THAT WAS SO ENGROSSING AND THE WHOLE INDUSTRY WAS EXPANDING SO MUCH THAT IT DID TEND TO CROWD OUT MOST OF THE OTHER THINGS IN MY
NathanMyhrvold_2007 YEAH YOU KNOW I THIS WHOLE TALK HAS BEEN A MILE WIDE AND AN INCH DEEP
NathanMyhrvold_2007 BUT THAT'S REALLY WHAT WORKS FOR ME
NathanMyhrvold_2007 THE COMMON OR LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR IS ME THAT'S IT THANK YOU
