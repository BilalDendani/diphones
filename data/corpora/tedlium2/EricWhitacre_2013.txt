EricWhitacre_2013 NINETY ONE I HAD
EricWhitacre_2013 MAYBE THE MOST PROFOUND AND TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE I WAS IN THE THIRD YEAR OF MY SEVEN YEAR UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE
EricWhitacre_2013 OVER THE MOUNTAINS COMING IN FROM THE NORTH WERE THESE STEVEN SPIELBERGIAN CLOUDS ROLLING TOWARD US AND AS THE CLOUDS GOT ABOUT HALFWAY OVER THE VALLEY SO HELP ME GOD EVERY SINGLE ANIMAL IN THAT PLACE STOPPED MAKING NOISE AT THE SAME TIME
EricWhitacre_2013 IT WAS JUST EXTRAORDINARY AND WHEN I CAME BACK HOME I FOUND A POEM BY THE MEXICAN POET OCTAVIO PAZ AND DECIDED TO SET IT TO MUSIC A PIECE FOR CHOIR CALLED CLOUDBURST WHICH IS THE PIECE THAT WE 'LL PERFORM FOR YOU IN JUST A MOMENT
EricWhitacre_2013 NOW FAST FORWARD TO JUST THREE YEARS AGO
EricWhitacre_2013 VIDEO THERE CONDUCTING THESE PEOPLE ALONE IN THEIR DORM ROOMS
EricWhitacre_2013 TWO YEARS AGO ON THIS VERY STAGE WE
EricWhitacre_2013 TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTY TWO SINGERS FROM FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTRIES
EricWhitacre_2013 THIS TIME PERFORMING A PIECE THAT I HAD WRITTEN CALLED SLEEP AND THEN JUST LAST SPRING
EricWhitacre_2013 WE RELEASED VIRTUAL CHOIR THREE
EricWhitacre_2013 AND WHEN I WAS SPEAKING TO CHRIS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF VIRTUAL CHOIR AND WHERE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TAKE THIS HE CHALLENGED ME TO PUSH THE TECHNOLOGY AS FAR AS WE POSSIBLY COULD COULD WE DO THIS ALL IN REAL TIME COULD WE HAVE PEOPLE SINGING TOGETHER IN REAL TIME AND WITH THE HELP OF SKYPE THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO ATTEMPT TODAY
EricWhitacre_2013 NOW WE 'LL PERFORM CLOUDBURST FOR YOU THE FIRST HALF WILL BE PERFORMED BY THE LIVE SINGERS HERE ON STAGE I 'M JOINED BY SINGERS FROM CAL STATE LONG BEACH CAL STATE FULLERTON
EricWhitacre_2013 AND RIVERSIDE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SOME OF THE BEST AMATEUR CHOIRS IN THE COUNTRY AND
EricWhitacre_2013 LESS THAN A SECOND OF LATENCY BUT IN MUSICAL TERMS THAT 'S A LIFETIME WE DEAL IN MILLISECONDS SO WHAT I 'VE DONE IS I 'VE ADAPTED CLOUDBURST SO THAT IT EMBRACES THE LATENCY AND THE PERFORMERS SING INTO THE LATENCY INSTEAD OF TRYING TO BE EXACTLY TOGETHER SO
EricWhitacre_2013 WITH DEEP HUMILITY AND FOR YOUR APPROVAL WE PRESENT CLOUDBURST
EricWhitacre_2013 THANK
