AtulGawande_2012@29.03:40.7 SO THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU ASK THEN AT THAT POINT IS HOW DO I GET GOOD AT WHAT I 'M TRYING TO DO AND IT BECAME A QUESTION OF HOW DO WE ALL GET GOOD AT WHAT WE 'RE TRYING TO DO
AtulGawande_2012@41.01:43.91 IT 'S HARD ENOUGH TO LEARN TO GET THE SKILLS
AtulGawande_2012@44.71:62.88 TRY TO LEARN ALL THE MATERIAL YOU HAVE TO ABSORB AT ANY TASK YOU 'RE TAKING ON I HAD TO THINK ABOUT HOW I SEW AND HOW I CUT BUT THEN ALSO HOW I PICK THE RIGHT PERSON TO COME TO AN OPERATING ROOM AND THEN IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS CAME THIS NEW CONTEXT FOR THINKING ABOUT WHAT IT MEANT TO BE GOOD
AtulGawande_2012@63.73:76.45 IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WE REALIZED WE WERE IN THE DEEPEST CRISIS OF MEDICINE 'S EXISTENCE DUE TO SOMETHING YOU DON 'T NORMALLY THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU 'RE A DOCTOR CONCERNED WITH HOW YOU DO GOOD FOR PEOPLE
AtulGawande_2012@80.96:88.96 THERE 'S NOT A COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT NOW IS NOT ASKING WHETHER WE CAN AFFORD WHAT DOCTORS DO
AtulGawande_2012@89.3:99.85 THE POLITICAL FIGHT THAT WE 'VE DEVELOPED HAS BECOME ONE AROUND WHETHER IT 'S THE GOVERNMENT THAT 'S THE PROBLEM OR IS IT INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE THE PROBLEM
AtulGawande_2012@101.42:103.69 AND THE ANSWER IS YES
AtulGawande_2012@104.58:118.54 AND NO IT 'S DEEPER THAN ALL OF THAT THE CAUSE OF OUR TROUBLES IS ACTUALLY THE COMPLEXITY THAT SCIENCE HAS GIVEN US AND IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THIS I 'M GOING TO TAKE YOU BACK A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS
AtulGawande_2012@118.54:123.46 I WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK TO A TIME WHEN LEWIS THOMAS WAS WRITING IN HIS BOOK
AtulGawande_2012@144.34:146.17 AND VERY INEFFECTIVE
AtulGawande_2012@148.99:153.18 IF YOU WERE IN A HOSPITAL HE SAID IT WAS
AtulGawande_2012@153.36:157.65 GOING TO DO YOU GOOD ONLY BECAUSE IT OFFERED YOU SOME WARMTH
AtulGawande_2012@158.41:160.84 SOME FOOD SHELTER
AtulGawande_2012@161.12:167.25 AND MAYBE THE CARING ATTENTION OF A NURSE DOCTORS AND MEDICINE
AtulGawande_2012@168.71:170.42 MADE NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL
AtulGawande_2012@171.22:180.71 THAT DIDN 'T SEEM TO PREVENT THE DOCTORS FROM BEING FRANTICALLY BUSY IN THEIR DAYS AS HE EXPLAINED WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO DO WAS FIGURE OUT WHETHER YOU MIGHT HAVE
AtulGawande_2012@181.15:184.18 ONE OF THE DIAGNOSES FOR WHICH THEY COULD DO SOMETHING
AtulGawande_2012@184.42:186.45 AND THERE WERE A FEW
AtulGawande_2012@186.8:194.63 YOU MIGHT HAVE A LOBAR PNEUMONIA FOR EXAMPLE AND THEY COULD GIVE YOU AN ANTISERUM AN INJECTION OF RABID ANTIBODIES
AtulGawande_2012@195.64:202.2 TO THE BACTERIUM STREPTOCOCCUS IF THE INTERN SUB TYPED IT CORRECTLY
AtulGawande_2012@202.73:204.33 IF YOU HAD AN ACUTE
AtulGawande_2012@204.34:211.12 CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE THEY COULD BLEED A PINT OF BLOOD FROM YOU BY OPENING UP AN ARM VEIN
AtulGawande_2012@211.4:218.18 GIVING YOU A CRUDE LEAF PREPARATION OF DIGITALIS AND THEN GIVING YOU OXYGEN BY TENT
AtulGawande_2012@219.61:235.17 IF YOU HAD EARLY SIGNS OF PARALYSIS AND YOU WERE REALLY GOOD AT ASKING PERSONAL QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT FIGURE OUT THAT THIS PARALYSIS SOMEONE HAS IS FROM SYPHILIS IN WHICH CASE YOU COULD GIVE THIS NICE CONCOCTION OF MERCURY AND ARSENIC
AtulGawande_2012@236.9:239.43 AS LONG AS YOU DIDN 'T OVERDOSE THEM AND KILL THEM
AtulGawande_2012@241.65:247.58 BEYOND THESE SORTS OF THINGS A MEDICAL DOCTOR DIDN 'T HAVE A LOT THAT THEY COULD DO
AtulGawande_2012@248.22:253.9 THIS WAS WHEN THE CORE STRUCTURE OF MEDICINE WAS CREATED WHAT IT MEANT
AtulGawande_2012@253.9:267.38 TO BE GOOD AT WHAT WE DID AND HOW WE WANTED TO BUILD MEDICINE TO BE IT WAS AT A TIME WHEN WHAT WAS KNOWN YOU COULD KNOW YOU COULD HOLD IT ALL IN YOUR HEAD AND YOU COULD DO IT ALL IF YOU HAD A PRESCRIPTION PAD
AtulGawande_2012@267.38:275.16 IF YOU HAD A NURSE IF YOU HAD A HOSPITAL THAT WOULD GIVE YOU A PLACE TO CONVALESCE MAYBE SOME BASIC TOOLS YOU REALLY COULD DO IT ALL
AtulGawande_2012@275.16:286.51 YOU SET THE FRACTURE YOU DREW THE BLOOD YOU SPUN THE BLOOD LOOKED AT IT UNDER THE MICROSCOPE YOU PLATED THE CULTURE YOU INJECTED THE ANTISERUM THIS WAS
AtulGawande_2012@290.78:299.84 AS A RESULT WE BUILT IT AROUND A CULTURE AND SET OF VALUES THAT SAID WHAT YOU WERE GOOD AT WAS BEING DARING
AtulGawande_2012@303.37:308.59 AT BEING COURAGEOUS AT BEING INDEPENDENT AND SELF SUFFICIENT AUTONOMY
AtulGawande_2012@308.61:311.11 WAS OUR HIGHEST VALUE
AtulGawande_2012@313.33:321.25 GO A COUPLE GENERATIONS FORWARD TO WHERE WE ARE THOUGH AND IT LOOKS LIKE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WORLD WE HAVE NOW FOUND TREATMENTS
AtulGawande_2012@321.74:332.58 FOR NEARLY ALL OF THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CONDITIONS THAT A HUMAN BEING CAN HAVE WE CAN 'T CURE IT ALL WE CAN 'T GUARANTEE THAT EVERYBODY WILL LIVE A LONG AND HEALTHY LIFE
AtulGawande_2012@333.15:335.75 BUT WE CAN MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR MOST
AtulGawande_2012@342.03:345.25 FOUR THOUSAND MEDICAL AND SURGICAL PROCEDURES
AtulGawande_2012@345.85:350.88 WE 'VE DISCOVERED SIX THOUSAND DRUGS THAT I 'M NOW LICENSED TO PRESCRIBE
AtulGawande_2012@352.12:355.65 AND WE 'RE TRYING TO DEPLOY THIS CAPABILITY TOWN BY TOWN
AtulGawande_2012@356.16:358 TO EVERY PERSON ALIVE
AtulGawande_2012@359.95:363.25 IN OUR OWN COUNTRY LET ALONE AROUND THE WORLD
AtulGawande_2012@363.77:367.63 AND WE 'VE REACHED THE POINT WHERE WE 'VE REALIZED AS DOCTORS
AtulGawande_2012@368.69:370.69 WE CAN 'T KNOW IT ALL
AtulGawande_2012@370.69:375.31 WE CAN 'T DO IT ALL BY OURSELVES
AtulGawande_2012@375.31:392.99 THERE WAS A STUDY WHERE THEY LOOKED AT HOW MANY CLINICIANS IT TOOK TO TAKE CARE OF YOU IF YOU CAME INTO A HOSPITAL AS IT CHANGED OVER TIME AND IN THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY IT TOOK JUST OVER TWO FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS OF CLINICIANS THAT IS TO SAY IT TOOK BASICALLY THE NURSING TIME
AtulGawande_2012@414.75:416.75 WE 'RE ALL SPECIALISTS NOW
AtulGawande_2012@417.09:422.06 EVEN THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS EVERYONE JUST HAS A PIECE OF THE CARE
AtulGawande_2012@423.57:431.57 BUT HOLDING ONTO THAT STRUCTURE WE BUILT AROUND THE DARING INDEPENDENCE SELF SUFFICIENCY OF EACH OF THOSE PEOPLE
AtulGawande_2012@435.01:440.34 WE HAVE TRAINED HIRED AND REWARDED PEOPLE TO BE COWBOYS
AtulGawande_2012@441.69:447.31 BUT IT 'S PIT CREWS THAT WE NEED PIT CREWS FOR PATIENTS
AtulGawande_2012@447.45:457.01 THERE 'S EVIDENCE ALL AROUND US FORTY PERCENT OF OUR CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE PATIENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES RECEIVE INCOMPLETE OR INAPPROPRIATE CARE
AtulGawande_2012@480.13:498.84 OUR EXPERIENCE AS PEOPLE WHO GET SICK NEED HELP FROM OTHER PEOPLE IS THAT WE HAVE AMAZING CLINICIANS THAT WE CAN TURN TO HARDWORKING INCREDIBLY WELL TRAINED AND VERY SMART THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO INCREDIBLE TECHNOLOGIES THAT GIVE US GREAT HOPE
AtulGawande_2012@505.36:507.79 FROM START TO FINISH
AtulGawande_2012@508.33:510.07 IN A SUCCESSFUL WAY
AtulGawande_2012@510.61:512.2 THERE 'S ANOTHER SIGN
AtulGawande_2012@512.63:514.28 THAT WE NEED PIT CREWS
AtulGawande_2012@514.57:517.23 AND THAT 'S THE UNMANAGEABLE COST
AtulGawande_2012@517.88:519.5 OF OUR CARE
AtulGawande_2012@520.37:528.27 NOW WE IN MEDICINE I THINK ARE BAFFLED BY THIS QUESTION OF COST WE WANT TO SAY THIS IS JUST THE WAY IT IS
AtulGawande_2012@528.77:538.15 THIS IS JUST WHAT MEDICINE REQUIRES WHEN YOU GO FROM A WORLD WHERE YOU TREATED ARTHRITIS WITH ASPIRIN THAT MOSTLY DIDN 'T DO THE JOB
AtulGawande_2012@538.39:544.11 TO ONE WHERE IF IT GETS BAD ENOUGH WE CAN DO A HIP REPLACEMENT A KNEE REPLACEMENT THAT GIVES YOU
AtulGawande_2012@544.28:552.08 YEARS MAYBE DECADES WITHOUT DISABILITY A DRAMATIC CHANGE WELL IS IT ANY SURPRISE
AtulGawande_2012@561.71:566.37 BUT I THINK WE 'RE IGNORING CERTAIN FACTS THAT TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO
AtulGawande_2012@567.46:578.88 AS WE 'VE LOOKED AT THE DATA ABOUT THE RESULTS THAT HAVE COME AS THE COMPLEXITY HAS INCREASED WE FOUND THAT THE MOST EXPENSIVE CARE
AtulGawande_2012@579.76:585.3 IS NOT NECESSARILY THE BEST CARE AND VICE VERSA THE BEST CARE
AtulGawande_2012@586.22:589.27 OFTEN TURNS OUT TO BE THE LEAST EXPENSIVE
AtulGawande_2012@590.11:595.13 HAS FEWER COMPLICATIONS THE PEOPLE GET MORE EFFICIENT AT WHAT THEY DO
AtulGawande_2012@596.22:599.75 AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THERE 'S HOPE
AtulGawande_2012@600.88:608.18 BECAUSE IF TO HAVE THE BEST RESULTS YOU REALLY NEEDED THE MOST EXPENSIVE CARE IN THE COUNTRY OR IN THE WORLD
AtulGawande_2012@608.83:611.41 WELL THEN WE REALLY WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT RATIONING
AtulGawande_2012@612.14:614.44 WHO WE 'RE GOING TO CUT OFF FROM MEDICARE
AtulGawande_2012@619.59:626.85 BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE POSITIVE DEVIANTS THE ONES WHO ARE GETTING THE BEST RESULTS AT THE LOWEST COSTS
AtulGawande_2012@626.85:641.36 WE FIND THE ONES THAT LOOK THE MOST LIKE SYSTEMS ARE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL THAT IS TO SAY THEY FOUND WAYS TO GET ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PIECES ALL OF THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS TO COME TOGETHER INTO A WHOLE
AtulGawande_2012@642.76:654.06 HAVING GREAT COMPONENTS IS NOT ENOUGH AND YET WE 'VE BEEN OBSESSED IN MEDICINE WITH COMPONENTS WE WANT THE BEST DRUGS THE BEST TECHNOLOGIES THE BEST SPECIALISTS
AtulGawande_2012@654.59:673.14 BUT WE DON 'T THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT HOW IT ALL COMES TOGETHER IT 'S A TERRIBLE DESIGN STRATEGY ACTUALLY THERE 'S A FAMOUS THOUGHT EXPERIMENT THAT TOUCHES EXACTLY ON THIS THAT SAID WHAT IF YOU BUILT A CAR FROM THE VERY BEST CAR PARTS
AtulGawande_2012@684.27:687.58 A VERY EXPENSIVE PILE OF JUNK THAT DOES NOT GO ANYWHERE
AtulGawande_2012@688.58:692.92 AND THAT IS WHAT MEDICINE CAN FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES
AtulGawande_2012@694.03:695.67 IT 'S NOT A SYSTEM
AtulGawande_2012@696.92:698.58 NOW A SYSTEM HOWEVER
AtulGawande_2012@699.21:701.18 WHEN THINGS START TO COME TOGETHER
AtulGawande_2012@702.02:707.13 YOU REALIZE IT HAS CERTAIN SKILLS FOR ACTING AND LOOKING THAT WAY
AtulGawande_2012@707.58:724.99 SKILL NUMBER ONE IS THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE SUCCESS AND THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE FAILURE WHEN YOU ARE A SPECIALIST YOU CAN 'T SEE THE END RESULT VERY WELL YOU HAVE TO BECOME REALLY INTERESTED IN DATA UNSEXY AS THAT SOUNDS
AtulGawande_2012@725.51:744.89 ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES IS A SURGEON IN CEDAR RAPIDS IOWA AND HE GOT INTERESTED IN THE QUESTION OF WELL HOW MANY CT SCANS DID THEY DO FOR THEIR COMMUNITY IN CEDAR RAPIDS HE GOT INTERESTED IN THIS BECAUSE THERE HAD BEEN GOVERNMENT REPORTS NEWSPAPER REPORTS JOURNAL ARTICLES SAYING THAT THERE HAD BEEN TOO MANY CT SCANS DONE
AtulGawande_2012@757.67:766.92 AND WHAT HE FOUND WAS THAT FOR THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THEIR COMMUNITY IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR THEY HAD DONE FIFTY TWO THOUSAND CT SCANS
AtulGawande_2012@768.48:770.86 THEY HAD FOUND A PROBLEM
AtulGawande_2012@772.05:776.55 WHICH BRINGS US TO SKILL NUMBER TWO A SYSTEM HAS
AtulGawande_2012@777.04:783.23 SKILL ONE FIND WHERE YOUR FAILURES ARE SKILL TWO IS DEVISE SOLUTIONS
AtulGawande_2012@784.21:799.08 I GOT INTERESTED IN THIS WHEN THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION CAME TO MY TEAM ASKING IF WE COULD HELP WITH A PROJECT TO REDUCE DEATHS IN SURGERY THE VOLUME OF SURGERY HAD SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD BUT THE SAFETY OF SURGERY HAD NOT
AtulGawande_2012@799.68:809.79 NOW OUR USUAL TACTICS FOR TACKLING PROBLEMS LIKE THESE ARE TO DO MORE TRAINING GIVE PEOPLE MORE SPECIALIZATION OR BRING IN MORE TECHNOLOGY
AtulGawande_2012@810.3:820.8 WELL IN SURGERY YOU COULDN 'T HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE SPECIALIZED AND YOU COULDN 'T HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE BETTER TRAINED AND YET WE SEE UNCONSCIONABLE LEVELS OF
AtulGawande_2012@825.45:842.21 AND SO WE LOOKED AT WHAT OTHER HIGH RISK INDUSTRIES DO WE LOOKED AT SKYSCRAPER CONSTRUCTION WE LOOKED AT THE AVIATION WORLD AND WE FOUND THAT THEY HAVE TECHNOLOGY THEY HAVE TRAINING AND THEN THEY HAVE ONE OTHER THING THEY HAVE CHECKLISTS
AtulGawande_2012@843.01:851.14 I DID NOT EXPECT TO BE SPENDING A SIGNIFICANT PART OF MY TIME AS A HARVARD SURGEON WORRYING ABOUT CHECKLISTS
AtulGawande_2012@851.79:854.75 AND YET WHAT WE FOUND WERE THAT
AtulGawande_2012@855.06:869.07 THESE WERE TOOLS TO HELP MAKE EXPERTS BETTER WE GOT THE LEAD SAFETY ENGINEER FOR BOEING TO HELP US COULD WE DESIGN A CHECKLIST FOR SURGERY NOT FOR THE LOWEST PEOPLE ON THE
AtulGawande_2012@875.43:887.26 AND WHAT THEY TAUGHT US WAS THAT DESIGNING A CHECKLIST TO HELP PEOPLE HANDLE COMPLEXITY ACTUALLY INVOLVES MORE DIFFICULTY THAN I HAD UNDERSTOOD YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE PAUSE POINTS
AtulGawande_2012@899.75:909.1 AND THEN YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON THE KILLER ITEMS AN AVIATION CHECKLIST LIKE THIS ONE FOR A SINGLE ENGINE PLANE ISN 'T A RECIPE FOR HOW TO FLY A PLANE
AtulGawande_2012@909.1:912.11 IT 'S A REMINDER OF THE KEY THINGS THAT GET FORGOTTEN
AtulGawande_2012@913.12:915.56 OR MISSED IF THEY 'RE NOT CHECKED
AtulGawande_2012@915.92:933.55 SO WE DID THIS WE CREATED A NINETEEN ITEM TWO MINUTE CHECKLIST FOR SURGICAL TEAMS WE HAD THE PAUSE POINTS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE ANESTHESIA IS GIVEN IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE KNIFE HITS THE SKIN IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE PATIENT LEAVES THE ROOM
AtulGawande_2012@933.55:946.6 AND WE HAD A MIX OF DUMB STUFF ON THERE MAKING SURE AN ANTIBIOTIC IS GIVEN IN THE RIGHT TIME FRAME BECAUSE THAT CUTS THE INFECTION RATE BY HALF AND THEN INTERESTING STUFF BECAUSE YOU CAN 'T MAKE A RECIPE FOR SOMETHING AS COMPLICATED AS SURGERY
AtulGawande_2012@946.6:964.55 INSTEAD YOU CAN MAKE A RECIPE FOR HOW TO HAVE A TEAM THAT 'S PREPARED FOR THE UNEXPECTED AND WE HAD ITEMS LIKE MAKING SURE EVERYONE IN THE ROOM HAD INTRODUCED THEMSELVES BY NAME AT THE START OF THE DAY BECAUSE YOU GET HALF A DOZEN PEOPLE OR MORE WHO ARE SOMETIMES COMING TOGETHER AS A TEAM FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT DAY
AtulGawande_2012@964.55:967.93 THAT YOU 'RE COMING IN WE IMPLEMENTED THIS CHECKLIST
AtulGawande_2012@967.93:970.28 IN EIGHT HOSPITALS AROUND THE WORLD
AtulGawande_2012@970.69:982.6 DELIBERATELY IN PLACES FROM RURAL TANZANIA TO THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON IN SEATTLE WE FOUND THAT AFTER THEY ADOPTED IT THE COMPLICATION RATES FELL THIRTY FIVE PERCENT
AtulGawande_2012@983.37:990.28 IT FELL IN EVERY HOSPITAL IT WENT INTO THE DEATH RATES FELL FORTY SEVEN PERCENT
AtulGawande_2012@991.4:993.27 THIS WAS BIGGER THAN A DRUG
AtulGawande_2012@1003.48:1010.66 THE ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THIS TO GET COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE ENTIRE CHAIN TO ACTUALLY DO THESE THINGS
AtulGawande_2012@1012.05:1017.11 AND IT 'S BEEN SLOW TO SPREAD THIS IS NOT YET OUR NORM IN SURGERY
AtulGawande_2012@1017.45:1022.32 LET ALONE MAKING CHECKLISTS TO GO ONTO CHILDBIRTH AND OTHER AREAS
AtulGawande_2012@1022.57:1040.41 THERE 'S A DEEP RESISTANCE BECAUSE USING THESE TOOLS FORCES US TO CONFRONT THAT WE 'RE NOT A SYSTEM FORCES US TO BEHAVE WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF VALUES JUST USING A CHECKLIST REQUIRES YOU TO EMBRACE DIFFERENT VALUES FROM THE ONES WE 'VE HAD LIKE HUMILITY
AtulGawande_2012@1059.38:1077.67 I ASKED HIM WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO ACTUALLY HERD A THOUSAND CATTLE ACROSS HUNDREDS OF MILES HOW DID YOU DO THAT AND HE SAID WE HAVE THE COWBOYS STATIONED AT DISTINCT PLACES ALL AROUND THEY COMMUNICATE ELECTRONICALLY CONSTANTLY AND THEY HAVE PROTOCOLS AND CHECKLISTS FOR HOW THEY HANDLE EVERYTHING LAUGHTER FROM
AtulGawande_2012@1079.98:1084.36 BAD WEATHER TO EMERGENCIES OR INOCULATIONS FOR THE CATTLE
AtulGawande_2012@1085.08:1092.59 EVEN THE COWBOYS ARE PIT CREWS NOW AND IT SEEMED LIKE TIME THAT WE BECOME THAT WAY OURSELVES
AtulGawande_2012@1092.59:1105.67 MAKING SYSTEMS WORK IS THE GREAT TASK OF MY GENERATION OF PHYSICIANS AND SCIENTISTS BUT I WOULD GO FURTHER AND SAY THAT MAKING SYSTEMS WORK WHETHER IN HEALTH CARE EDUCATION
AtulGawande_2012@1106.06:1112.83 CLIMATE CHANGE MAKING A PATHWAY OUT OF POVERTY IS THE GREAT TASK OF OUR GENERATION AS A WHOLE
AtulGawande_2012@1112.94:1121.17 IN EVERY FIELD KNOWLEDGE HAS EXPLODED BUT IT HAS BROUGHT COMPLEXITY IT HAS BROUGHT SPECIALIZATION
AtulGawande_2012@1121.57:1125.03 AND WE 'VE COME TO A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RECOGNIZE
AtulGawande_2012@1125.94:1129.23 AS INDIVIDUALISTIC AS WE WANT TO BE
AtulGawande_2012@1129.34:1132.94 COMPLEXITY REQUIRES GROUP SUCCESS
