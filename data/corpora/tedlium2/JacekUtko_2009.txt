JacekUtko_2009 AND WE SHOULD SAVE TREES IN THE END SO IT'S ENOUGH TO BURY ANY INDUSTRY SO SHOULD WE RATHER ASK CAN ANYTHING SAVE NEWSPAPERS
JacekUtko_2009 SHOULD BE OPINION DRIVEN LESS NEWS MORE VIEWS AND WE'D RATHER READ IT DURING BREAKFAST BECAUSE LATER WE LISTEN TO RADIO IN A CAR CHECK YOUR MAIL AT WORK AND IN THE EVENING
JacekUtko_2009 SO WHAT CAN WE DO
JacekUtko_2009 LET ME TELL YOU MY STORY TWENTY YEARS AGO BONNIER SWEDISH PUBLISHER STARTED TO SET NEWSPAPERS IN THE FORMER SOVIET BLOC AFTER A FEW YEARS THEY HAD SEVERAL NEWSPAPERS IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE
JacekUtko_2009 BY AN INEXPERIENCED STAFF
JacekUtko_2009 WITH NO VISUAL CULTURE NO BUDGETS FOR VISUAL ARTS
JacekUtko_2009 IN MANY PLACES THERE WERE NO EVEN ART DIRECTORS I DECIDED TO BE TO WORK FOR THEM AS AN ART DIRECTOR
JacekUtko_2009 AND I HAD A REVELATION I THOUGHT THESE GUYS TOOK SOME CREEPY RUN DOWN ENTERTAINMENT AND PUT IT TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE
JacekUtko_2009 OH MY GOD MAYBE I CAN DO THE SAME WITH THESE BORING NEWSPAPERS AND I DID WE STARTED TO REDESIGN THEM ONE BY ONE
JacekUtko_2009 THE FRONT PAGE BECAME OUR SIGNATURE
JacekUtko_2009 SOON IT STARTED TO BRING RESULTS
JacekUtko_2009 IN POLAND OUR PAGES WERE NAMED COVERS OF THE YEAR THREE TIMES IN A ROW
JacekUtko_2009 CAN SEE HERE ARE FROM LATVIA LITHUANIA ESTONIA THE
JacekUtko_2009 AND MUSIC HAS A RYTHM HAS UPS AND DOWNS
JacekUtko_2009 AND DESIGN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS EXPERIENCE
JacekUtko_2009 TWO PAGES BOTH SPREADS AS A ONE PAGE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW READERS PERCEIVE IT YOU CAN SEE SOME RUSSIAN PAGES HERE WHICH GOT MANY AWARDS ON BIGGEST INFOGRAPHIC COMPETITION IN
JacekUtko_2009 THE REAL AWARD CAME FROM SOCIETY FOR NEWSPAPER DESIGN
JacekUtko_2009 JUST A YEAR AFTER REDESIGNING THIS NEWSPAPER IN POLAND THEY NAME IT THE
JacekUtko_2009 ISN'T AMAZING
JacekUtko_2009 REALLY MAKES IT AMAZING THAT THE CIRCULATION OF THESE NEWSPAPERS WERE GROWING TOO JUST SOME EXAMPLES IN RUSSIA PLUS ELEVEN AFTER ONE YEAR PLUS TWENTY NINE AFTER THREE YEARS OF THE
JacekUtko_2009 SAME IN POLAND PLUS THIRTEEN UP TO THIRTY FIVE PERCENT
JacekUtko_2009 OF CIRCULATION AFTER THREE YEARS
JacekUtko_2009 YOU CAN SEE ON A GRAPH AFTER YEARS OF STAGNATION THE PAPER STARTED TO GROW JUST AFTER REDESIGN
JacekUtko_2009 BUT THE REAL HIT WAS
JacekUtko_2009 AND THAT IS REALLY AMAZING
JacekUtko_2009 JUST A PART OF THE PROCESS AND THE PROCESS WE MADE WAS NOT ABOUT CHANGING THE LOOK IT WAS ABOUT IMPROVING THE PRODUCT COMPLETELY
JacekUtko_2009 I TOOK AN ARCHITECTURAL RULE ABOUT FUNCTION AND FORM AND TRANSLATED IT INTO NEWSPAPER CONTENT AND DESIGN AND I PUT A STRATEGY AT THE TOP OF IT SO FIRST YOU ASK A BIG QUESTION WHY WE DO IT WHAT IS THE GOAL THEN WE ADJUST THE CONTENT ACCORDINGLY
JacekUtko_2009 AND THEN USUALLY AFTER TWO MONTHS WE START DESIGNING MY BOSSES IN THE BEGINNING WERE VERY SURPRISED WHY AM I ASKING ALL OF THESE BUSINESS QUESTIONS INSTEAD OF JUST SHOWING THEM PAGES
JacekUtko_2009 THEY REALIZED THAT THIS IS THE NEW ROLE OF DESIGNER TO BE IN THIS PROCESS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING TO THE VERY END
JacekUtko_2009 SO WHAT IS THE LESSON BEHIND IT THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT THAT DESIGN CAN CHANGE NOT JUST YOUR PRODUCT IT CAN CHANGE YOUR WORKFLOW ACTUALLY IT CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING
JacekUtko_2009 IN YOUR COMPANY IT CAN TURN YOUR COMPANY UPSIDE DOWN IT CAN EVEN CHANGE YOU AND WHO 'S RESPONSIBLE DESIGNERS GIVE POWER TO DESIGNERS
JacekUtko_2009 THE SECOND IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
JacekUtko_2009 YOU CAN HAVE NO BUDGETS NO PEOPLE BUT STILL CAN PUT YOUR WORK TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE LEVEL
JacekUtko_2009 NEED TO REMEMBER THAT TO BE GOOD IS NOT ENOUGH
