NickSears_2007 FULLER PRESENTED A PARTICULARLY AUDACIOUS PROPOSAL FOR THE GEOSCOPE
NickSears_2007 IT WAS A TWO HUNDRED FOOT DIAMETER GEODESIC SPHERE
NickSears_2007 HE FELT COULD TRULY INFORM AND DEEPLY AFFECT THE DECISION MAKING OF THIS BODY THROUGH
NickSears_2007 AND TODAY FORTY FIVE YEARS LATER WE CLEARLY HAVE NO LESS NEED FOR THIS KIND OF CLARITY AND PERSPECTIVE
NickSears_2007 BUT WHAT WE DO HAVE IS IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY TODAY WE DON'T NEED ONE MILLION LIGHTBULBS TO CREATE A SPHERICAL DISPLAY WE CAN USE
NickSears_2007 ARE SMALLER THEY'RE CHEAPER THEY'RE LONGER LASTING THEY'RE MORE EFFICIENT
NickSears_2007 MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR THIS THEY'RE FASTER AND THIS
NickSears_2007 COMBINED WITH TODAY 'S HIGH PERFORMANCE MICRO CONTROLLERS ALLOWED US TO ACTUALLY SIMULATE IN THIS PIECE OVER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND LEDS USING JUST SIXTY FOUR
NickSears_2007 THE EQUATOR 'S SPEED IS ACTUALLY ABOUT SIXTY MILES PER HOUR
NickSears_2007 ON BOARD MICRO CONTROLLERS THAT EACH TIME THIS RING ROTATES
NickSears_2007 IT AS IT PASSES THE REAR OF THE DISPLAY IT PICKS UP A POSITION SIGNAL AND FROM THAT THE ON BOARD MICRO CONTROLLERS CAN EXTRAPOLATE THE POSITION OF THE RING
NickSears_2007 AT ALL POINTS AROUND THE REVOLUTION AND DISPLAY ARBITRARY BITMAP IMAGES AND ANIMATIONS BUT THIS IS REALLY JUST THE BEGINNING
NickSears_2007 IN ADDITION TO HIGHER RESOLUTION VERSIONS OF THIS DISPLAY MY FATHER AND I ARE WORKING ON A NEW PATENT PENDING DESIGN FOR A FULLY VOLUMETRIC DISPLAY USING THE SAME PHENOMENON
NickSears_2007 IT ACHIEVES THIS BY ROTATING LEDS ABOUT TWO AXES SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE THIS IS A ELEVEN INCH DIAMETER CIRCUIT BOARD THESE BLOCKS REPRESENT LEDS AND SO YOU COULD SEE THAT AS THIS DISC ROTATES ABOUT THIS AXIS IT WILL CREATE
NickSears_2007 A DISC OF LIGHT THAT WE CAN CONTROL THAT'S NOTHING NEW THAT'S A PROPELLER CLOCK THAT'S
NickSears_2007 THE RIMS THAT YOU CAN BUY FOR YOUR CAR BUT WHAT IS NEW IS THAT WHEN WE ROTATE THIS DISC ABOUT THIS AXIS
NickSears_2007 NOW THIS DISC OF LIGHT ACTUALLY BECOMES A SPHERE OF LIGHT
NickSears_2007 AND SO WE CAN CONTROL THAT WITH MICRO CONTROLLERS AND CREATE A FULLY VOLUMETRIC THREE DIMENSIONAL DISPLAY WITH JUST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX LEDS NOW THIS PIECE IS CURRENTLY IN PROCESS
NickSears_2007 DUE OUT IN MAY BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE PUT TOGETHER A SMALL DEMO JUST TO SHOW THE GEOMETRIC TRANSLATION OF POINTS INTO A SPHERE
NickSears_2007 AND HERE YOU CAN SEE IT'S ROTATING ABOUT THE VERTICAL AXIS ONLY CREATING CIRCLES
NickSears_2007 THE SHUTTER SPEED OF THE CAMERA ACTUALLY MAKES IT SLIGHTLY LESS EFFECTIVE IN THIS CASE BUT THIS PIECE IS DUE OUT IN MAY
NickSears_2007 LOVE TO TALK TO YOU ALL AND INVITE YOU TO COME DOWN AND TAKE A CLOSER LOOK
