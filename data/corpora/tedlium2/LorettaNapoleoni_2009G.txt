LorettaNapoleoni_2009G SHOW YOU HOW TERRORISM ACTUALLY INTERACTS WITH OUR DAILY LIFE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM A FRIEND
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G AT THE TIME HE WAS LOOKING AFTER THE RIGHTS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS IN ITALIAN JAILS HE ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO INTERVIEW THE RED BRIGADES
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G NOW AS MANY OF YOU MAY REMEMBER THE RED BRIGADES WAS A TERRORIST MARXIST ORGANIZATION WHICH WAS VERY ACTIVE IN ITALY FROM THE NINETEEN SIXTIES UNTIL THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G AS PART OF THEIR STRATEGY THE RED BRIGADES NEVER SPOKE WITH ANYBODY NOT EVEN WITH THEIR LAWYERS THEY SAT IN SILENCE THROUGH THEIR TRAILS WAVING OCCASIONALLY AT FAMILY AND FRIENDS
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G WHEN I ASKED MY FRIEND WHY THE RED BRIGADES WANT TO TALK TO ME HE SAID THAT THE FEMALE MEMBERS OF
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G ACTUALLY SUPPORTED MY NAME IN PARTICULAR ONE PERSON HAD PUT IT FORWARD SHE WAS MY CHILDHOOD FRIEND
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G THE TIME OF THE PHONE CALL I JUST HAD A BABY I SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED A MANAGEMENT BUYOUT TO THE COMPANY I WAS WORKING WITH AND THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO WAS TO GO BACK HOME AND TOURING THE HIGH SECURITY
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G IS EXACTLY WHAT I DID BECAUSE I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HAD TURNED MY BEST FRIEND INTO A TERRORIST AND WHY SHE'D NEVER TRIED TO RECRUIT ME
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G SO THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I DID NOW I
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G THE ANSWER VERY QUICKLY I ACTUALLY HAD FAILED THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILING OF A TERRORIST THE CENTER COMMITTEE OF THE RED BRIGADES HAD JUDGED ME TOO SINGLE MINDED AND TOO OPINIONATED TO BECOME A GOOD TERRORIST
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G MY FRIEND ON THE OTHER HAND SHE WAS A GOOD TERRORIST BECAUSE SHE WAS VERY GOOD AT FOLLOWING ORDERS SHE ALSO EMBRACED VIOLENCE BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED THAT THE ONLY WAY TO UNBLOCK WHAT AT THE TIME WAS
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G KNOWN AS A BLOCKED DEMOCRACY ITALY A COUNTRY RUN BY THE SAME PARTY FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS WAS
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G I WAS INTERVIEWING THE RED BRIGADES I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THEIR LIFE WAS NOT RULED BY POLITICS OR IDEOLOGY BUT ACTUALLY WAS RULED BY ECONOMICS THEY WERE CONSTANTLY SHORT OF
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G THEY WERE CONSTANTLY SEARCHING FOR CASH NOW CONTRARY TO WHAT MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE TERRORISM IS ACTUALLY A VERY EXPENSIVE BUSINESS I'LL GIVE YOU AN IDEA
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE TURNOVER OF THE RED BRIGADES ON A YEARLY BASIS WAS SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G THIS IS ROUGHLY BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION TODAY NOW YOU KNOW IF YOU LIVE UNDERGROUND IT'S REALLY HARD TO PRODUCE THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G THIS ALSO EXPLAINS WHY WHEN I WAS INTERVIEWING THE RED BRIGADES AND THEN LATER ON OTHER ARMS ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING MEMBERS OF AL ZARQAWI GROUP IN THE MIDDLE EAST
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G THE POLITICAL VISION OF A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IS DECIDED BY THE LEADERSHIP WHICH GENERALLY IS NEVER MORE THAN FIVE TO SEVEN PEOPLE ALL THE OTHERS DO DAY IN AND DAY OUT IS SEARCH FOR MONEY
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G FOR EXAMPLE I WAS INTERVIEWING THIS PART TIMER FROM THE RED BRIGADES IT WAS
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G HE LOVED SAILING HE WAS A REALLY KEEN SAILOR AND HE HAD THIS BEAUTIFUL BOAT AND HE TOLD ME THAT THE BEST TIME OF HIS LIFE WAS WHEN HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE RED BRIGADES
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G SAILING EVERY SUMMER BACK AND FORTH FROM LEBANON WHERE HE WOULD PICK UP SOVIET WEAPONS FROM THE PLO AND THEN CARRY THEM ALL THE WAY TO SARDINIA WHERE THE OTHER ARMS ORGANIZATION FROM EUROPE WOULD GO AND TAKE THEIR SHARE
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G OF THE ARMS FOR THAT SERVICE THE RED BRIGADES WERE ACTUALLY PAID A FEE WHICH WENT TO FUND THEIR ORGANIZATION SO BECAUSE I AM A TRAINED ECONOMIST AND I THINK IN ECONOMIC TERMS ALL OF THE SUDDEN I
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING HERE MAYBE THERE IS A LINK A COMMERCIAL LINK BETWEEN ONE ORGANIZATION AND ANOTHER ONE BUT IT WAS ONLY WHEN
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G I INTERVIEWED MARIO MORETTI THE HEAD OF THE RED BRIGADES THE MAN WHO KIDNAPPED AND KILLED ALDO MORO
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G ITALIAN FORMER PRIME MINISTER THAT I FINALLY REALIZED THAT TERRORISM IS ACTUALLY BUSINESS
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G WAS BACK IN THE CITY OF LONDON HAVING LUNCH WITH A FELLOW BANKER OR AN ECONOMIST THIS GUY THOUGHT IN THE SAME WAY I DID
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G SO I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO INVESTIGATE THE ECONOMICS OF TERRORISM NATURALLY NOBODY WANTED TO FUND MY RESEARCH
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G IN FACT I THINK MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT I WAS A BIT CRAZY YOU KNOW THAT WOMAN THAT GOES AROUND TO FOUNDATIONS ASKING FOR MONEY THINKING ABOUT THE ECONOMICS OF TERRORISM
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G WHICH HAS BEEN CREATED BY ARMS ORGANIZATIONS SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR II AND WHAT IS EVEN MORE SHOCKING IS THAT THIS SYSTEM
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G THE EVOLUTION OF OUR OWN SYSTEM OF OUR WESTERN CAPITALISM AND THERE ARE THREE MAIN STAGES THE FIRST ONE IS THE STATE SPONSOR OF
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G OF COURSE IS THE GLOBALIZATION OF TERRORISM SO
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G FULLY FUNDING ARMS ORGANIZATIONS A MIX OF LEGAL AND ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES IS USED SO THE LINK BETWEEN CRIME AND TERROR IS ESTABLISHED VERY EARLY ON
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G FOR EXAMPLE THE IRAN CONTRA AFFAIR THEN COMES THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES EARLY EIGHTIES AND
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G GROUPS SUCCESSFULLY CARRY OUT THE PRIVATIZATION OF TERRORISM SO THEY
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G THE SPONSOR AND START FUNDING THEMSELVES NOW AGAIN WE SEE A MIX OF LEGAL AND ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES SO
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G AND THE IRA WHICH CONTROL THE PRIVATE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IN NORTHERN IRELAND DID EXACTLY THE SAME THING SO
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT SOMEBODY GOT INTO A TAXI IN BELFAST WITHOUT KNOWING ACTUALLY WAS FUNDING THE IRA
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G BUT THE GREAT CHANGE CAME OF COURSE WITH GLOBALIZATION AND DEREGULATION THIS IS WHEN
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G TO LINK UP ALSO FINANCIALLY WITH EACH OTHER BUT ABOVE ALL THEY STARTED TO DO SERIOUS BUSINESS WITH THE WORLD OF CRIME
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G AND TOGETHER THEY MONEY LAUNDERED THEIR DIRTY BUSINESS THROUGH THE SAME CHANNEL THIS IS WHEN WE SEE THE BIRTH OF THE TRANSNATIONAL ARMS
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G THIS IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT CAN RAISE MONEY ACROSS BORDER BUT ALSO THAT IS ABLE TO CARRY OUT ATTACKS IN MORE THAN ONE COUNTRY
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G COMES BACK AT TIMES OF GREAT TRANSFORMATION GLOBALIZATION BEING ONE OF THOSE TRANSFORMATIONS IT IS AT THIS TIMES IN WHICH
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G NOW I CALCULATED HOW BIG WAS THIS INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC SYSTEM COMPOSED BY CRIME TERROR AND ILLEGAL ECONOMY BEFORE NINE ELEVEN
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G AND IT IS A STAGGERING ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS IT IS TRILLIONS IT'S NOT BILLIONS THIS IS ABOUT TWICE THE GDP OF THE UNITED KINGDOM SOON WILL BE MORE CONSIDERING WHERE THIS COUNTRY IS GOING
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G NOW
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G ALL THIS MONEY FLEW INTO THE U S ECONOMY BECAUSE THE BULK OF THE MONEY WAS DENOMINATED IN U S DOLLARS
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G AND THE MONEY LAUNDERING WAS TAKING PLACE INSIDE THE UNITED STATES THE ENTRY POINT OF COURSE OF MOST OF THIS MONEY
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G FACILITIES SO THIS WAS A VITAL INJECTION OF CASH INTO THE U S ECONOMY
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G NOW WHEN I WENT TO LOOK AT THE FIGURES OF THE U S MONEY SUPPLY THE U S MONEY SUPPLY IS THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THAT
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G THE FEDERAL RESERVES PRINTS EVERY YEAR IN ORDER TO SATISFY THE INCREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR DOLLARS WHICH OF COURSE REFLECTS THE GROWTH OF THE ECONOMY
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G THESE WERE MONEY TAKEN OUT IN SUITCASES OR IN CONTAINERS IN CASH OF COURSE THESE WERE MONEY TAKEN OUT BY CRIMINALS AND MONEY LAUNDERERS
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G THESE WERE MONEY TAKEN OUT TO FUND THE GROWTH OF THE TERROR ILLEGAL AND CRIMINAL ECONOMY
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G SO YOU SEE WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP THE UNITED STATES ACTUALLY
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G A COUNTRY THAT IS THE RESERVE CURRENCY OF THE WORLD WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT MEANS THAT IT HAS A PRIVILEGE THAT OTHER COUNTRIES DO NOT
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G CAN BORROW AGAINST THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DOLLARS IN CIRCULATION IN THE WORLD THIS PRIVILEGE IS CALLED SEIGNIORAGE NO
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G COUNTRY CAN DO THAT ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES FOR EXAMPLE THE UNITED KINGDOM CAN BORROW ONLY
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G INSIDE ITS OWN BORDERS SO HERE IS THE IMPLICATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE WORLDS OF CRIME TERROR AND ILLEGAL ECONOMY AND OUR ECONOMY THE
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WAS BORROWING AGAINST THE GROWTH OF THE TERROR ILLEGAL AND CRIMINAL ECONOMY
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G THIS IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE WITH THIS WORLD
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G NOW THIS SITUATION CHANGED OF COURSE AFTER NINE ELEVEN BECAUSE GEORGE BUSH LAUNCHED THE WAR ON TERROR PART OF THE WAR ON TERROR WAS THE INTRODUCTION OF THE PATRIOT ACT
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT THE PATRIOT ACT IS A LEGISLATION THAT GREATLY REDUCES THE LIBERTIES OF AMERICANS IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEM AGAINST
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G IS A SECTION OF THE PATRIOT ACT WHICH REFERS SPECIFICALLY TO FINANCE AND IT IS IN FACT AN ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATION
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G FROM DOING ANY BUSINESSES WITH OFF SHORE FACILITIES IT CLOSED THAT DOOR BETWEEN THE MONEY LAUNDERING IN DOLLARS AND THE U S ECONOMY
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G ALSO GAVE THE U S MONETARY AUTHORITIES THE RIGHT TO MONITOR ANY DOLLAR TRANSACTION TAKING PLACE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G NOW YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT WAS THE REACTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCE AND BANKING ALL THE BANKERS SAID TO THEIR CLIENTS GET OUT OF THE DOLLARS
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G AND GO AND INVEST SOMEWHERE ELSE NOW THE EURO WAS A NEWLY BORN CURRENCY OF GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR BUSINESS AND OF COURSE FOR INVESTMENT AND THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G AND TERROR PEOPLE SIMPLY MOVED THEIR MONEY LAUNDERING
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G ACTIVITIES AWAY FROM THE UNITED STATES INTO EUROPE
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G WHY DID THIS HAPPEN THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G WAS A UNILATERAL LEGISLATION IT WAS INTRODUCED ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES AND IT WAS INTRODUCED ONLY FOR THE U S DOLLARS IN EUROPE A SIMILAR LEGISLATION WAS NOT
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G SO WITHIN SIX MONTHS EUROPE BECAME THE EPICENTER OF THE MONEY LAUNDERING ACTIVITIES OF THE WORLD
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G SO THIS IS HOW INCREDIBLE ARE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE WORLD OF CRIME AND THE WORLD OF TERROR AND OUR OWN LIFE
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G SO WHY DID I TELL YOU THIS STORY I TOLD YOU THIS STORY BECAUSE YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A WORLD THAT GOES WELL BEYOND THE HEADLINES OF THE NEWSPAPERS
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G THIS IS THE ONLY WAY FOR YOU TO STEP INTO THE DARK SIDE AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT AND BELIEVE ME
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G IT'S GOING TO BE SCARY IT'S GOING TO BE FRIGHTFUL BUT IT'S GOING TO ENLIGHTEN YOU AND ABOVE ALL IT'S NOT GOING TO BE BORING
