GregLynn_2005@12.45:24.14 I THOUGHT I WOULD TALK ABOUT TODAY IS THE TRANSITION FROM ONE MODE OF THINKING ABOUT NATURE TO ANOTHER THAT'S TRACKED BY ARCHITECTURE WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT ARCHITECTS IS
GregLynn_2005@24.48:31.17 WE ALWAYS HAVE TRIED TO JUSTIFY BEAUTY BY LOOKING TO NATURE AND ARGUABLY
GregLynn_2005@40.00:52.11 WAS WHETHER THE NUMBER FIVE OR THE NUMBER SEVEN WAS A BETTER PROPORTION TO THINK ABOUT ARCHITECTURE BECAUSE THE NOSE WAS ONE FIFTH OF YOUR HEAD OR BECAUSE YOUR HEAD WAS ONE SEVENTH OF YOUR BODY
GregLynn_2005@52.58:62.09 AND THE REASON THAT THAT WAS THE MODEL OF BEAUTY AND OF NATURE WAS BECAUSE THE DECIMAL POINT HAD NOT BEEN INVENTED YET IT WAS IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
GregLynn_2005@62.53:74.45 AND EVERYBODY HAD TO DIMENSION A BUILDING IN TERMS OF FRACTIONS SO A ROOM WOULD BE DIMENSIONED AS ONE FOURTH OF A FACADE THE STRUCTURAL DAIS OF THAT MIGHT BE DIMENSIONED
