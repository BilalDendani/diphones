TristramStuart_2012S I WENT TO THE LOCAL BAKER AND TOOK THEIR STALE BREAD I WENT TO THE LOCAL GREENGROCER AND I WENT TO A FARMER WHO WAS THROWING AWAY POTATOES BECAUSE THEY WERE THE WRONG SHAPE OR SIZE FOR SUPERMARKETS
TristramStuart_2012S POCKET MONEY ADDITION TO MY
TristramStuart_2012S TEENAGE ALLOWANCE
TristramStuart_2012S BUT I NOTICED THAT MOST OF THE FOOD THAT I WAS GIVING MY PIGS WAS IN FACT FIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION
TristramStuart_2012S AND THAT I WAS ONLY SCRATCHING THE SURFACE AND THAT RIGHT THE WAY UP THE FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN IN SUPERMARKETS GREENGROCERS BAKERS IN OUR HOMES IN FACTORIES AND FARMS WE WERE HEMORRHAGING OUT FOOD
TristramStuart_2012S SUPERMARKETS DIDN 'T EVEN WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW MUCH FOOD THEY WERE WASTING I 'D BEEN ROUND THE BACK I 'D SEEN BINS FULL OF FOOD BEING LOCKED AND THEN TRUCKED OFF TO LANDFILL SITES AND I THOUGHT SURELY
TristramStuart_2012S THERE IS SOMETHING MORE SENSIBLE TO DO WITH FOOD THAN WASTE IT
TristramStuart_2012S ONE MORNING WHEN I WAS FEEDING MY PIGS I NOTICED A PARTICULARLY TASTY LOOKING SUN DRIED TOMATO LOAF THAT USED TO CROP UP FROM TIME TO TIME
TristramStuart_2012S I GRABBED HOLD OF IT SAT DOWN AND ATE MY BREAKFAST WITH MY PIGS
TristramStuart_2012S REALLY AN EXHIBITION OF THE INJUSTICE OF FOOD WASTE
TristramStuart_2012S AND THE PROVISION OF THE SOLUTION TO FOOD WASTE WHICH IS SIMPLY TO SIT DOWN AND EAT FOOD RATHER THAN THROWING IT AWAY
TristramStuart_2012S EVENTUALLY I SET ABOUT WRITING MY BOOK REALLY TO DEMONSTRATE THE EXTENT OF THIS PROBLEM ON A GLOBAL SCALE
TristramStuart_2012S WHAT THIS SHOWS IS A NATION BY NATION BREAKDOWN OF THE LIKELY LEVEL OF FOOD WASTE IN EACH COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
TristramStuart_2012S UNFORTUNATELY EMPIRICAL DATA GOOD HARD STATS DON 'T EXIST AND THEREFORE TO PROVE MY POINT I FIRST OF ALL HAD TO FIND SOME PROXY WAY OF UNCOVERING HOW MUCH FOOD WAS BEING WASTED
TristramStuart_2012S THAT BLACK LINE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT TABLE IS THE LIKELY LEVEL OF CONSUMPTION
TristramStuart_2012S WITH AN ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN LEVELS OF INEVITABLE WASTE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE WASTE I 'M NOT THAT UNREALISTIC THAT I THINK WE CAN LIVE IN A WASTE FREE WORLD
TristramStuart_2012S BUT THAT BLACK LINE SHOWS WHAT A FOOD SUPPLY SHOULD BE IN A COUNTRY IF THEY ALLOW FOR A GOOD STABLE SECURE
TristramStuart_2012S NUTRITIONAL DIET FOR EVERY PERSON IN THAT COUNTRY ANY DOT ABOVE THAT LINE AND YOU 'LL QUICKLY NOTICE THAT THAT INCLUDES MOST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD
TristramStuart_2012S REPRESENTS UNNECESSARY SURPLUS AND IS LIKELY TO REFLECT LEVELS OF WASTE IN EACH COUNTRY
TristramStuart_2012S AS A COUNTRY GETS RICHER IT INVESTS MORE AND MORE IN GETTING MORE AND MORE SURPLUS INTO ITS SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS
TristramStuart_2012S BUT THE THING THAT REALLY STRUCK ME WHEN I PLOTTED ALL THIS DATA AND IT WAS A LOT OF NUMBERS
TristramStuart_2012S COUNTRIES RAPIDLY SHOOT TOWARDS THAT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MARK AND THEN THEY LEVEL OFF AND THEY DON 'T REALLY GO ON RISING AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT
TristramStuart_2012S SO I DECIDED TO UNPACK THAT DATA A LITTLE BIT FURTHER TO SEE IF THAT WAS TRUE OR FALSE
TristramStuart_2012S AND THAT 'S WHAT I CAME UP WITH IF YOU INCLUDE NOT JUST THE FOOD THAT ENDS UP IN SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS BUT ALSO THE FOOD THAT PEOPLE FEED TO LIVESTOCK
TristramStuart_2012S THE MAIZE THE SOY THE WHEAT THAT HUMANS COULD EAT BUT CHOOSE TO FATTEN LIVESTOCK INSTEAD TO PRODUCE INCREASING AMOUNTS OF MEAT AND DAIRY PRODUCTS WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT MOST RICH COUNTRIES HAVE BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR TIMES
TristramStuart_2012S THE AMOUNT OF FOOD THAT THEIR POPULATION NEEDS TO FEED ITSELF A COUNTRY LIKE AMERICA HAS FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT OF FOOD
TristramStuart_2012S THE FACT IS WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS BUFFER IN RICH COUNTRIES BETWEEN OURSELVES AND HUNGER
TristramStuart_2012S WE 'VE NEVER HAD SUCH GARGANTUAN SURPLUSES BEFORE
TristramStuart_2012S IN MANY WAYS THIS IS A GREAT SUCCESS STORY OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION OF THE AGRICULTURAL SURPLUSES THAT WE SET OUT TO ACHIEVE TWELVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO
TristramStuart_2012S AND WHEN WE CHOP DOWN FORESTS AS WE ARE EVERY DAY TO GROW MORE AND MORE FOOD
TristramStuart_2012S WHEN WE EXTRACT WATER FROM DEPLETING WATER RESERVES WHEN WE EMIT FOSSIL FUEL
TristramStuart_2012S EMISSIONS IN THE QUEST TO GROW MORE AND MORE FOOD AND THEN WE THROW AWAY SO MUCH OF IT
TristramStuart_2012S WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN START
TristramStuart_2012S AND YESTERDAY
TristramStuart_2012S I WENT TO ONE OF THE LOCAL SUPERMARKETS THAT I OFTEN VISIT
TristramStuart_2012S SO I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE THAT THESE NINE BISCUITS THAT I FOUND IN THE BIN REPRESENT THE GLOBAL FOOD SUPPLY OKAY WE START OUT WITH NINE THAT 'S WHAT 'S IN FIELDS AROUND THE WORLD EVERY SINGLE YEAR
TristramStuart_2012S THE FIRST BISCUIT WE 'RE GOING TO LOSE BEFORE WE EVEN LEAVE THE FARM THAT 'S A PROBLEM PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH
TristramStuart_2012S DEVELOPING WORK AGRICULTURE WHETHER IT 'S A LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE REFRIGERATION PASTEURIZATION GRAIN STORES EVEN BASIC FRUIT CRATES WHICH MEANS THAT FOOD GOES TO WASTE BEFORE IT EVEN LEAVES THE FIELDS THE NEXT THREE BISCUITS
TristramStuart_2012S UNFORTUNATELY OUR BEASTS ARE INEFFICIENT ANIMALS
TristramStuart_2012S AND THEY TURN TWO THIRDS OF THAT INTO FECES AND HEAT SO WE 'VE LOST THOSE TWO AND WE 'VE ONLY KEPT THIS ONE IN MEAT AND DAIRY PRODUCTS
TristramStuart_2012S TWO MORE WE 'RE GOING TO THROW AWAY DIRECTLY INTO BINS THIS IS WHAT MOST OF US THINK OF WHEN WE THINK OF FOOD WASTE WHAT ENDS UP IN THE GARBAGE WHAT ENDS UP IN SUPERMARKET BINS WHAT ENDS UP IN RESTAURANT BINS WE 'VE LOST ANOTHER TWO AND WE 'VE LEFT OURSELVES WITH JUST FOUR BISCUITS TO FEED ON
TristramStuart_2012S THAT IS NOT A SUPERLATIVELY EFFICIENT USE OF GLOBAL RESOURCES ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THINK OF THE BILLION HUNGRY PEOPLE THAT EXIST ALREADY IN THE WORLD HAVING GONE THROUGH THE DATA I THEN NEEDED TO DEMONSTRATE WHERE THAT FOOD ENDS UP
TristramStuart_2012S WHERE DOES IT END UP WE 'RE USED TO SEEING THE STUFF ON OUR PLATES BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE STUFF THAT GOES MISSING IN BETWEEN
TristramStuart_2012S SUPERMARKETS ARE AN EASY PLACE TO START
TristramStuart_2012S THIS IS THE RESULT OF MY HOBBY WHICH IS UNOFFICIAL BIN INSPECTIONS
TristramStuart_2012S IT REPRESENTS A COLOSSAL WASTE OF FOOD BUT WHAT I DISCOVERED WHILST I WAS WRITING MY BOOK WAS THAT THIS VERY EVIDENT
TristramStuart_2012S ABUNDANCE OF WASTE WAS ACTUALLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG
TristramStuart_2012S WHEN YOU START GOING UP THE SUPPLY CHAIN YOU FIND
TristramStuart_2012S WHERE THE REAL FOOD WASTE IS HAPPENING ON A GARGANTUAN SCALE
TristramStuart_2012S WHO LIVES IN A HOUSEHOLD WHERE IT DOES GET EATEN
TristramStuart_2012S OKAY MOST PEOPLE NOT EVERYONE BUT MOST PEOPLE AND THIS IS I 'M GLAD TO SAY WHAT I SEE ACROSS THE WORLD AND YET HAS ANYONE SEEN A SUPERMARKET OR SANDWICH SHOP ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD THAT SERVES SANDWICHES WITH CRUSTS ON IT
TristramStuart_2012S GO ONE STEP UP AND YOU GET TO FARMERS WHO THROW AWAY SOMETIMES A THIRD OR EVEN MORE OF THEIR HARVEST BECAUSE OF COSMETIC STANDARDS THIS FARMER FOR EXAMPLE HAS INVESTED SIXTEEN THOUSAND POUNDS IN GROWING SPINACH NOT ONE LEAF OF WHICH HE HARVESTED BECAUSE THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF GRASS GROWING IN AMONGST IT
TristramStuart_2012S POTATOES THAT ARE COSMETICALLY IMPERFECT ALL GOING FOR PIGS
TristramStuart_2012S PARSNIPS THAT ARE TOO SMALL FOR SUPERMARKET SPECIFICATIONS
TristramStuart_2012S TOMATOES IN TENERIFE
TristramStuart_2012S ALL BEING DISCARDED PERFECTLY EDIBLE BECAUSE THEY 'RE THE WRONG SHAPE OR SIZE
TristramStuart_2012S LIVER LUNGS HEADS TAILS KIDNEYS TESTICLES ALL OF THESE THINGS WHICH ARE TRADITIONAL DELICIOUS AND NUTRITIOUS PARTS OF OUR GASTRONOMY
TristramStuart_2012S THIS MAN IN KASHGAR XINJIANG PROVINCE IN WESTERN CHINA IS SERVING UP HIS NATIONAL DISH IT 'S CALLED SHEEP 'S ORGANS IT 'S DELICIOUS IT 'S NUTRITIOUS AND AS I LEARNED WHEN I WENT TO KASHGAR IT SYMBOLIZES THEIR TABOO AGAINST FOOD WASTE I WAS SITTING IN A ROADSIDE CAFE
TristramStuart_2012S A CHEF CAME TO TALK TO ME I FINISHED MY BOWL AND HALFWAY THROUGH THE CONVERSATION HE STOPPED TALKING AND HE STARTED FROWNING INTO MY BOWL
TristramStuart_2012S I THOUGHT MY GOODNESS WHAT TABOO HAVE I BROKEN HOW HAVE I INSULTED MY HOST
TristramStuart_2012S HE POINTED AT THREE GRAINS OF RICE AT THE BOTTOM OF MY BOWL AND HE SAID CLEAN
TristramStuart_2012S FISH FORTY TO SIXTY PERCENT OF EUROPEAN FISH ARE DISCARDED AT SEA THEY DON 'T EVEN GET LANDED
TristramStuart_2012S IN OUR HOMES WE 'VE LOST TOUCH WITH FOOD THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT I DID ON THREE LETTUCES
TristramStuart_2012S WHO KEEPS LETTUCES IN THEIR FRIDGE
TristramStuart_2012S SOME FOOD WASTE AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING WILL INEVITABLY ARISE SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE BEST THING TO DO WITH IT I ANSWERED THAT QUESTION WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN IN FACT HUMANS ANSWERED THAT QUESTION SIX THOUSAND YEARS AGO
TristramStuart_2012S WE DOMESTICATED PIGS
TristramStuart_2012S TO TURN FOOD WASTE BACK INTO FOOD
TristramStuart_2012S AND YET IN EUROPE THAT PRACTICE HAS BECOME ILLEGAL
TristramStuart_2012S SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE AS A RESULT OF THE FOOT AND MOUTH OUTBREAK IT 'S UNSCIENTIFIC IT 'S UNNECESSARY IF YOU COOK FOOD FOR PIGS JUST AS IF YOU COOK FOOD FOR HUMANS IT IS RENDERED SAFE
TristramStuart_2012S IT 'S ALSO A MASSIVE SAVING OF RESOURCES AT THE MOMENT EUROPE DEPENDS ON IMPORTING MILLIONS OF TONS OF SOY FROM SOUTH AMERICA WHERE ITS PRODUCTION CONTRIBUTES TO GLOBAL WARMING TO DEFORESTATION TO BIODIVERSITY LOSS
TristramStuart_2012S TO FEED LIVESTOCK HERE IN EUROPE AT THE SAME TIME WE THROW AWAY MILLIONS OF TONS OF FOOD WASTE WHICH WE COULD AND SHOULD BE FEEDING THEM
TristramStuart_2012S IF WE DID THAT AND FED IT TO PIGS WE WOULD SAVE THAT AMOUNT OF CARBON
TristramStuart_2012S IF WE FEED OUR FOOD WASTE WHICH IS THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT FAVORITE WAY OF GETTING RID OF FOOD WASTE TO ANAEROBIC DIGESTION WHICH TURNS FOOD WASTE INTO GAS TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY YOU SAVE A PALTRY FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT KILOGRAMS OF CARBON DIOXIDE PER TON OF FOOD WASTE IT 'S MUCH BETTER TO FEED IT TO PIGS WE KNEW THAT DURING THE WAR
TristramStuart_2012S THE BEST THING TO DO WITH FOOD IS TO EAT AND ENJOY IT AND TO STOP WASTING IT FOR THE SAKE OF THE PLANET WE LIVE ON
TristramStuart_2012S WE ARE A TERRESTRIAL ANIMAL AND WE DEPEND ON OUR LAND
