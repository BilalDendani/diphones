DanielWolpert_2011G AND IN NEUROSCIENCE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH MANY DIFFICULT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BRAIN BUT I WANT TO START WITH THE EASIEST QUESTION AND THE QUESTION YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE ALL ASKED YOURSELVES AT SOME POINT IN YOUR LIFE BECAUSE IT 'S A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IF WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND BRAIN FUNCTION AND THAT IS WHY DO WE AND OTHER ANIMALS HAVE
DanielWolpert_2011G NOW YOU MAY REASON THAT WE HAVE ONE TO PERCEIVE THE WORLD OR TO THINK AND THAT 'S COMPLETELY WRONG
DanielWolpert_2011G IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS QUESTION FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME IT 'S BLINDINGLY OBVIOUS WHY WE HAVE A BRAIN WE HAVE A BRAIN FOR ONE REASON AND ONE REASON ONLY AND THAT 'S TO PRODUCE ADAPTABLE AND COMPLEX MOVEMENTS THERE IS NO OTHER REASON TO HAVE A BRAIN THINK ABOUT IT
DanielWolpert_2011G MOVEMENT IS THE ONLY WAY YOU HAVE OF AFFECTING THE WORLD AROUND YOU NOW THAT 'S NOT QUITE TRUE THERE 'S ONE OTHER WAY AND THAT 'S THROUGH SWEATING BUT APART FROM THAT EVERYTHING ELSE GOES THROUGH CONTRACTIONS OF MUSCLES SO THINK ABOUT COMMUNICATION
DanielWolpert_2011G OR PERCEIVING THE COLOR OF A ROSE IF IT DOESN 'T AFFECT THE WAY YOU 'RE GOING TO MOVE LATER IN LIFE NOW FOR THOSE WHO DON 'T BELIEVE THIS ARGUMENT WE HAVE TREES AND GRASS ON OUR PLANET WITHOUT THE BRAIN BUT THE CLINCHING EVIDENCE IS THIS ANIMAL HERE THE HUMBLE SEA SQUIRT
DanielWolpert_2011G RUDIMENTARY ANIMAL HAS A NERVOUS SYSTEM SWIMS AROUND IN THE OCEAN IN ITS JUVENILE LIFE
DanielWolpert_2011G AND THIS ANIMAL IS OFTEN TAKEN AS AN ANALOGY TO WHAT HAPPENS AT UNIVERSITIES WHEN PROFESSORS GET TENURE BUT THAT
DanielWolpert_2011G NOW IF MOVEMENT IS SO IMPORTANT HOW WELL ARE WE DOING UNDERSTANDING HOW THE BRAIN CONTROLS MOVEMENT AND THE ANSWER IS WE 'RE DOING EXTREMELY POORLY IT 'S A VERY HARD PROBLEM BUT WE CAN LOOK AT HOW WELL WE 'RE DOING BY THINKING ABOUT HOW WELL WE 'RE DOING BUILDING MACHINES WHICH CAN DO WHAT HUMANS CAN DO THINK ABOUT THE GAME OF CHESS
DanielWolpert_2011G HOW WELL ARE WE DOING DETERMINING WHAT PIECE TO MOVE WHERE
DanielWolpert_2011G ROOM IT WOULD WIN EVERY TIME THAT PROBLEM IS SOLVED
DanielWolpert_2011G BUT WITH VAST COMPUTERS WE APPROXIMATE AND COME CLOSE TO THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION WHEN IT COMES TO BEING DEXTEROUS IT 'S NOT EVEN CLEAR WHAT THE ALGORITHM IS YOU HAVE TO SOLVE TO BE DEXTEROUS AND WE 'LL SEE YOU HAVE TO BOTH PERCEIVE AND ACT ON THE WORLD WHICH HAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS
DanielWolpert_2011G BUT LET ME SHOW YOU CUTTING EDGE ROBOTICS NOW A LOT OF ROBOTICS IS VERY IMPRESSIVE BUT MANIPULATION ROBOTICS IS REALLY JUST IN THE DARK AGES SO THIS IS THE END OF A PH D PROJECT FROM ONE OF THE BEST ROBOTICS INSTITUTES AND THE STUDENT HAS TRAINED THIS ROBOT TO POUR THIS WATER INTO A GLASS IT 'S A HARD PROBLEM BECAUSE THE WATER SLOSHES ABOUT BUT IT CAN DO IT
DanielWolpert_2011G BUT IT DOESN 'T DO IT WITH ANYTHING LIKE THE AGILITY OF A HUMAN NOW IF YOU WANT THIS ROBOT TO DO A DIFFERENT TASK THAT 'S ANOTHER THREE YEAR PH D PROGRAM THERE IS NO
DanielWolpert_2011G AND THIS IS HER GETTING THE WORLD RECORD IN REAL TIME
DanielWolpert_2011G AND IT SOUNDS LIKE AN EASY PROBLEM YOU SEND A COMMAND DOWN IT CAUSES MUSCLES TO CONTRACT YOUR ARM OR BODY MOVES AND YOU GET SENSORY FEEDBACK FROM VISION FROM SKIN FROM MUSCLES AND SO ON
DanielWolpert_2011G WE USE IT IN THE ENGINEERING AND NEUROSCIENCE SENSE MEANING A RANDOM NOISE CORRUPTING A SIGNAL SO THE OLD DAYS BEFORE DIGITAL RADIO WHEN YOU WERE TUNING IN YOUR RADIO AND YOU HEARD
DanielWolpert_2011G SIMILARLY WHEN YOU PUT MOTOR OUTPUT ON MOVEMENT OUTPUT IT 'S EXTREMELY NOISY FORGET ABOUT TRYING TO HIT THE BULL 'S EYE IN DARTS JUST AIM FOR THE SAME SPOT OVER AND OVER AGAIN YOU HAVE A HUGE SPREAD DUE TO MOVEMENT VARIABILITY
DanielWolpert_2011G AND MORE THAN THAT THE OUTSIDE WORLD OR TASK IS BOTH AMBIGUOUS AND VARIABLE THE TEAPOT COULD BE FULL IT COULD BE EMPTY IT CHANGES OVER TIME
DanielWolpert_2011G SO IF YOU 'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO KNOCK A SMALL WHITE BALL INTO A HOLE SEVERAL HUNDRED YARDS AWAY USING A LONG METAL STICK OUR SOCIETY WILL BE WILLING TO REWARD YOU WITH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
DanielWolpert_2011G NOW WHAT I WANT TO CONVINCE YOU OF IS THE BRAIN ALSO GOES THROUGH A LOT OF EFFORT TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SORT OF NOISE AND VARIABILITY AND TO DO THAT I 'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT A FRAMEWORK WHICH IS VERY POPULAR IN STATISTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING OF THE LAST FIFTY YEARS CALLED BAYESIAN DECISION THEORY
DanielWolpert_2011G AND THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEA IS YOU WANT TO MAKE INFERENCES AND THEN TAKE ACTIONS SO LET 'S THINK ABOUT THE INFERENCE
DanielWolpert_2011G YOU WANT TO GENERATE BELIEFS ABOUT THE WORLD SO WHAT ARE BELIEFS BELIEFS COULD BE WHERE ARE MY ARMS IN SPACE AM I LOOKING AT A CAT OR A FOX BUT WE 'RE GOING TO REPRESENT BELIEFS WITH PROBABILITIES
DanielWolpert_2011G SO WE 'RE GOING TO REPRESENT A BELIEF WITH A NUMBER BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE ZERO MEANING I DON 'T BELIEVE IT AT ALL ONE MEANS I 'M ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN AND NUMBERS IN BETWEEN GIVE YOU THE GRAY LEVELS OF UNCERTAINTY
DanielWolpert_2011G AND THE KEY IDEA TO BAYESIAN INFERENCE IS YOU HAVE TWO SOURCES OF INFORMATION FROM WHICH TO MAKE YOUR
DanielWolpert_2011G BUT THERE 'S ANOTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND THAT 'S EFFECTIVELY PRIOR KNOWLEDGE YOU ACCUMULATE KNOWLEDGE THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE IN MEMORIES AND THE POINT ABOUT BAYESIAN DECISION THEORY IS IT GIVES YOU THE MATHEMATICS OF THE OPTIMAL WAY TO COMBINE YOUR PRIOR KNOWLEDGE WITH YOUR SENSORY EVIDENCE TO GENERATE NEW BELIEFS
DanielWolpert_2011G THAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN THE CURRENT SHOT BUT THERE 'S ANOTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION NOT AVAILABLE ON THE CURRENT SHOT BUT ONLY AVAILABLE BY REPEATED EXPERIENCE IN THE GAME OF TENNIS AND THAT 'S THAT THE BALL DOESN 'T BOUNCE WITH EQUAL PROBABILITY OVER THE COURT DURING THE MATCH
DanielWolpert_2011G WE LEARN ABOUT STATISTICS OF THE WORLD AND LAY THAT DOWN BUT WE ALSO LEARN ABOUT HOW NOISY OUR OWN SENSORY APPARATUS IS AND THEN COMBINE THOSE IN A REAL BAYESIAN WAY
DanielWolpert_2011G AND I WANT TO CONVINCE YOU THE BRAIN DOES MAKE PREDICTIONS OF THE SENSORY FEEDBACK IT 'S GOING TO GET AND MOREOVER IT PROFOUNDLY CHANGES YOUR PERCEPTIONS BY WHAT YOU DO AND TO DO THAT I 'LL TELL YOU ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN DEALS WITH SENSORY INPUT SO YOU SEND A COMMAND OUT
DanielWolpert_2011G YOU GET SENSORY FEEDBACK BACK AND THAT TRANSFORMATION IS GOVERNED BY THE PHYSICS OF YOUR BODY AND YOUR SENSORY APPARATUS
DanielWolpert_2011G BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE LOOKING INSIDE THE BRAIN AND HERE 'S INSIDE THE BRAIN YOU MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE PREDICTOR A NEURAL SIMULATOR OF THE PHYSICS OF YOUR BODY AND YOUR SENSES
DanielWolpert_2011G SO AS YOU SEND A MOVEMENT COMMAND DOWN YOU
DanielWolpert_2011G IMAGINE AS I SHAKE THE KETCHUP BOTTLE SOMEONE VERY KINDLY COMES UP TO ME AND TAPS IT ON THE BACK FOR ME
DanielWolpert_2011G NOW I GET AN EXTRA SOURCE OF SENSORY INFORMATION DUE TO THAT EXTERNAL ACT
DanielWolpert_2011G SO I GET TWO SOURCES I GET YOU TAPPING ON IT AND I GET ME SHAKING IT BUT FROM MY SENSES POINT OF VIEW THAT IS COMBINED TOGETHER INTO ONE SOURCE OF INFORMATION
DanielWolpert_2011G SO ONE WAY TO RECONSTRUCT THAT
DanielWolpert_2011G IS TO COMPARE THE PREDICTION WHICH IS ONLY BASED ON YOUR MOVEMENT COMMANDS
DanielWolpert_2011G WITH THE REALITY ANY DISCREPANCY SHOULD HOPEFULLY BE EXTERNAL SO AS I GO AROUND THE WORLD I 'M MAKING PREDICTIONS OF WHAT I SHOULD GET SUBTRACTING THEM OFF
DanielWolpert_2011G EVERYTHING LEFT OVER IS EXTERNAL TO ME WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE FOR THIS WELL THERE 'S ONE VERY CLEAR EXAMPLE WHERE A SENSATION GENERATED BY MYSELF FEELS VERY DIFFERENT THEN IF GENERATED BY ANOTHER PERSON AND SO WE DECIDED THE MOST OBVIOUS PLACE TO START WAS WITH TICKLING
DanielWolpert_2011G BUT IT HASN 'T REALLY BEEN SHOWN IT 'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE A NEURAL SIMULATOR SIMULATING YOUR OWN BODY AND SUBTRACTING OFF THAT SENSE SO WE CAN BRING THE EXPERIMENTS OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BY APPLYING ROBOTIC TECHNOLOGIES TO THIS PROBLEM AND IN EFFECT WHAT WE HAVE IS SOME SORT OF STICK IN ONE HAND ATTACHED TO A ROBOT AND THEY 'RE GOING TO MOVE THAT BACK AND FORWARD
DanielWolpert_2011G AND THEN WE 'RE GOING TO TRACK THAT WITH A COMPUTER AND USE IT TO CONTROL ANOTHER ROBOT WHICH IS GOING TO TICKLE THEIR PALM WITH ANOTHER
DanielWolpert_2011G SO THE IMPORTANT POINT HERE IS THE RIGHT HAND ALWAYS DOES THE SAME THINGS SINUSOIDAL MOVEMENT THE LEFT HAND ALWAYS IS THE SAME AND PUTS SINUSOIDAL TICKLE ALL WE 'RE PLAYING WITH IS A TEMPO CAUSALITY AND AS WE GO FROM NAUGHT TO ZERO POINT ONE SECOND IT BECOMES MORE TICKLISH
DanielWolpert_2011G NOW I HAVE TO ADMIT THESE ARE THE WORST STUDIES MY LAB HAS EVER RUN
DanielWolpert_2011G AND ONE THING YOU NOTICE ABOUT CHILDREN IN BACKSEATS OF CARS ON LONG JOURNEYS THEY GET INTO FIGHTS WHICH STARTED WITH ONE OF THEM DOING SOMETHING TO THE OTHER THE OTHER RETALIATING IT QUICKLY ESCALATES AND CHILDREN TEND TO GET INTO FIGHTS WHICH ESCALATE IN TERMS OF FORCE
DanielWolpert_2011G NOW WHEN I SCREAMED AT MY CHILDREN TO STOP SOMETIMES THEY WOULD BOTH SAY TO ME THE OTHER PERSON HIT THEM HARDER
DanielWolpert_2011G AND WE HYPOTHESIZE BASED ON THE TICKLING STUDY THAT WHEN ONE CHILD HITS ANOTHER THEY GENERATE THE MOVEMENT COMMAND THEY PREDICT THE SENSORY CONSEQUENCES AND SUBTRACT IT OFF SO THEY ACTUALLY THINK THEY 'VE HIT THE PERSON LESS HARD THAN THEY HAVE RATHER LIKE THE TICKLING WHEREAS THE PASSIVE RECIPIENT DOESN 'T MAKE THE PREDICTION
DanielWolpert_2011G WE DON 'T WORK WITH CHILDREN WE DON 'T WORK WITH HITTING BUT THE CONCEPT IS IDENTICAL WE BRING IN TWO ADULTS WE TELL THEM THEY 'RE GOING TO PLAY A GAME AND SO HERE 'S PLAYER ONE AND PLAYER TWO SITTING OPPOSITE TO EACH OTHER AND THE GAME IS VERY SIMPLE WE STARTED WITH A MOTOR
DanielWolpert_2011G AND WHAT WE 'VE MEASURED IS THE FORCE AS A FUNCTION OF TERMS AND IF WE LOOK AT WHAT WE START WITH A QUARTER OF A NEWTON THERE A NUMBER OF TURNS PERFECT WOULD BE THAT RED LINE AND WHAT WE SEE IN ALL PAIRS OF SUBJECTS IS THIS
DanielWolpert_2011G A SEVENTY PERCENT ESCALATION IN FORCE ON EACH GO
DanielWolpert_2011G SO I HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF CHOICE TO MAKE NOW IT TURNS OUT WE ARE EXTREMELY STEREOTYPICAL WE ALL MOVE THE SAME WAY PRETTY MUCH
DanielWolpert_2011G AND SO IT TURNS OUT WE 'RE SO STEREOTYPICAL OUR BRAINS HAVE GOT DEDICATED NEURAL CIRCUITRY TO DECODE THIS STEREOTYPING SO IF I TAKE SOME DOTS AND SET THEM IN MOTION WITH BIOLOGICAL MOTION YOUR BRAIN 'S CIRCUITRY WOULD UNDERSTAND INSTANTLY WHAT 'S GOING ON
DanielWolpert_2011G NOW THIS IS A BUNCH OF DOTS MOVING YOU WILL KNOW WHAT THIS PERSON IS DOING WHETHER HAPPY SAD OLD YOUNG A HUGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IF THESE DOTS WERE CARS GOING ON A RACING CIRCUIT YOU WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT 'S GOING ON SO WHY IS IT THAT WE MOVE THE PARTICULAR WAYS WE DO
DanielWolpert_2011G MAYBE WE DON 'T ALL QUITE MOVE THE SAME WAY MAYBE THERE 'S VARIATION IN THE POPULATION AND MAYBE THOSE WHO MOVE BETTER THAN OTHERS HAVE GOT MORE CHANCE OF GETTING THEIR CHILDREN INTO THE NEXT GENERATION
DanielWolpert_2011G IS A VERY NOISY VERSION SO IF I PICK THE SAME COMMAND THROUGH MANY TIMES I WILL GET A DIFFERENT NOISY VERSION EACH TIME BECAUSE NOISE CHANGES EACH TIME SO WHAT I CAN SHOW YOU HERE IS HOW THE VARIABILITY OF THE MOVEMENT WILL EVOLVE IF I CHOOSE THAT WAY
DanielWolpert_2011G IF I CHOOSE A DIFFERENT WAY OF MOVING ON THE RIGHT FOR EXAMPLE THEN I 'LL HAVE A DIFFERENT COMMAND DIFFERENT NOISE PLAYING THROUGH A NOISY SYSTEM VERY COMPLICATED ALL WE CAN BE SURE OF IS THE VARIABILITY WILL BE DIFFERENT IF I MOVE IN THIS PARTICULAR WAY
DanielWolpert_2011G I END UP WITH A SMALLER VARIABILITY ACROSS MANY MOVEMENTS SO IF I HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THOSE TWO I WOULD CHOOSE THE RIGHT ONE BECAUSE IT 'S LESS VARIABLE AND THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEA IS YOU WANT TO PLAN YOUR MOVEMENTS SO AS TO MINIMIZE THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE OF THE NOISE AND ONE INTUITION TO GET IS ACTUALLY THE AMOUNT OF NOISE OR VARIABILITY I SHOW HERE
