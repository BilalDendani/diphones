JanineShepherd_2012X CREATING THEM AND EMBRACING THEM AND FOR ME THAT WAS THE OLYMPIC DREAM THAT 'S WHAT DEFINED ME THAT WAS MY BLISS
JanineShepherd_2012X AND A DREAM LIFE WAS GOOD
JanineShepherd_2012X MY BODY WAS CONSUMED BY PAIN
JanineShepherd_2012X I 'D BEEN HIT BY A SPEEDING UTILITY TRUCK WITH ONLY TEN MINUTES TO GO ON THE BIKE RIDE I WAS AIRLIFTED FROM THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT BY A RESCUE HELICOPTER TO A LARGE SPINAL UNIT IN SYDNEY I HAD EXTENSIVE AND LIFE THREATENING INJURIES I 'D BROKEN MY NECK AND MY BACK IN SIX PLACES
JanineShepherd_2012X MY WHOLE RIGHT SIDE WAS RIPPED OPEN FILLED WITH GRAVEL MY HEAD WAS CUT OPEN ACROSS THE FRONT LIFTED BACK EXPOSING THE SKULL UNDERNEATH I HAD HEAD INJURES I HAD INTERNAL INJURIES I HAD MASSIVE BLOOD LOSS IN FACT I LOST ABOUT FIVE LITERS OF BLOOD WHICH IS ALL SOMEONE MY SIZE WOULD ACTUALLY HOLD
JanineShepherd_2012X BY THE TIME THE HELICOPTER ARRIVED AT PRINCE HENRY HOSPITAL IN SYDNEY MY BLOOD PRESSURE WAS FORTY OVER NOTHING
JanineShepherd_2012X I WAS HAVING A REALLY BAD DAY
JanineShepherd_2012X FOR OVER TEN DAYS I DRIFTED BETWEEN TWO DIMENSIONS I HAD AN AWARENESS
JanineShepherd_2012X OF BEING IN MY BODY BUT ALSO BEING OUT OF MY BODY SOMEWHERE ELSE WATCHING FROM ABOVE AS IF IT WAS HAPPENING TO SOMEONE ELSE WHY WOULD I WANT TO GO BACK TO A BODY THAT WAS SO BROKEN
JanineShepherd_2012X BUT THIS VOICE KEPT CALLING ME COME ON STAY WITH ME
JanineShepherd_2012X I WAS AT A CROSSROADS
JanineShepherd_2012X I KNEW IF I DIDN 'T RETURN TO MY BODY I 'D HAVE TO LEAVE THIS WORLD FOREVER
JanineShepherd_2012X IT WAS THE FIGHT OF MY LIFE
JanineShepherd_2012X AFTER TEN DAYS I MADE THE DECISION TO RETURN TO MY BODY
JanineShepherd_2012X AND THE INTERNAL BLEEDING STOPPED
JanineShepherd_2012X THE NEXT CONCERN WAS WHETHER I WOULD WALK AGAIN BECAUSE I WAS PARALYZED FROM THE WAIST DOWN
JanineShepherd_2012X STEPPED ON IT SMASHED IT INTO THOUSANDS OF PIECES THEY 'D HAVE TO OPERATE
JanineShepherd_2012X THEY WENT IN THEY PUT ME ON A BEANBAG THEY CUT ME LITERALLY CUT ME IN HALF I HAVE A SCAR THAT WRAPS AROUND MY ENTIRE BODY
JanineShepherd_2012X THEY PICKED AS MUCH BROKEN BONE
JanineShepherd_2012X AS THEY COULD THAT HAD LODGED IN MY SPINAL CORD THEY TOOK OUT TWO OF MY BROKEN RIBS AND THEY REBUILT
JanineShepherd_2012X MY BACK L ONE THEY REBUILT IT THEY TOOK OUT ANOTHER BROKEN RIB THEY FUSED T TWELVE L ONE AND L TWO TOGETHER THEN THEY STITCHED ME UP THEY TOOK AN ENTIRE HOUR TO STITCH ME UP I WOKE UP IN INTENSIVE CARE AND THE DOCTORS WERE REALLY EXCITED THAT THE OPERATION HAD BEEN A SUCCESS BECAUSE AT THAT STAGE
JanineShepherd_2012X I HAD A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT IN ONE OF MY BIG TOES AND I THOUGHT GREAT BECAUSE I 'M GOING TO THE OLYMPICS
JanineShepherd_2012X BUT THE DAMAGE IS PERMANENT THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM NERVES THERE IS NO CURE
JanineShepherd_2012X YOU HAVE NO FEELING FROM THE WAIST DOWN AND AT MOST YOU MIGHT GET TEN OR TWENTY PERCENT RETURN
JanineShepherd_2012X YOU 'LL HAVE INTERNAL INJURIES FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE YOU 'LL HAVE TO USE A CATHETER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND IF YOU WALK AGAIN IT WILL BE WITH CALIPERS AND A WALKING FRAME AND THEN SHE SAID JANINE YOU 'LL HAVE TO RETHINK EVERYTHING YOU DO IN YOUR LIFE BECAUSE YOU 'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THE THINGS YOU DID BEFORE
JanineShepherd_2012X I WAS AN ATHLETE THAT 'S ALL I KNEW THAT 'S ALL I 'D DONE IF I COULDN 'T DO THAT THEN WHAT COULD I DO AND THE QUESTION I ASKED MYSELF IS IF I COULDN 'T DO THAT
JanineShepherd_2012X THEY MOVED ME FROM INTENSIVE CARE TO ACUTE SPINAL I WAS LYING ON A THIN HARD SPINAL BED I HAD NO MOVEMENT IN MY LEGS I HAD TIGHT STOCKINGS ON TO PROTECT FROM BLOOD CLOTS I HAD ONE ARM IN PLASTER ONE ARM TIED DOWN BY DRIPS I HAD A NECK BRACE AND SANDBAGS ON EITHER SIDE OF MY HEAD
JanineShepherd_2012X AND I SAW MY WORLD THROUGH A MIRROR THAT WAS SUSPENDED ABOVE MY HEAD
JanineShepherd_2012X I SHARED THE WARD WITH FIVE OTHER PEOPLE AND THE AMAZING THING IS THAT BECAUSE WE WERE ALL LYING PARALYZED IN A SPINAL WARD WE DIDN 'T KNOW WHAT EACH OTHER LOOKED LIKE
JanineShepherd_2012X HOW AMAZING IS THAT HOW OFTEN IN LIFE DO YOU GET TO MAKE FRIENDSHIPS JUDGMENT FREE
JanineShepherd_2012X PURELY BASED ON SPIRIT
JanineShepherd_2012X AND THERE WERE NO SUPERFICIAL CONVERSATIONS AS WE SHARED OUR INNERMOST THOUGHTS OUR FEARS AND OUR HOPES FOR LIFE AFTER THE SPINAL WARD
JanineShepherd_2012X I REMEMBER ONE NIGHT ONE OF THE NURSES CAME IN JONATHAN WITH A WHOLE LOT OF PLASTIC STRAWS
JanineShepherd_2012X HE PUT A PILE ON TOP OF EACH OF US AND HE SAID START THREADING THEM TOGETHER WELL THERE WASN 'T MUCH
JanineShepherd_2012X SILENTLY AND HE JOINED ALL OF THE STRAWS UP TILL IT LOOPED AROUND THE WHOLE WARD AND THEN HE SAID OKAY EVERYBODY HOLD ON TO YOUR STRAWS
JanineShepherd_2012X AND WE DID AND HE SAID RIGHT
JanineShepherd_2012X NOW WE 'RE ALL CONNECTED AND AS WE HELD ON
JanineShepherd_2012X AND EVEN LYING PARALYZED IN THE SPINAL WARD
JanineShepherd_2012X THERE WERE MOMENTS OF INCREDIBLE DEPTH AND RICHNESS OF AUTHENTICITY AND CONNECTION
JanineShepherd_2012X THAT I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE
JanineShepherd_2012X AND EACH OF US KNEW THAT WHEN WE LEFT THE SPINAL WARD
JanineShepherd_2012X WE WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME
JanineShepherd_2012X AFTER SIX MONTHS IT WAS TIME TO GO HOME
JanineShepherd_2012X I REMEMBER DAD PUSHING ME OUTSIDE IN MY WHEELCHAIR WRAPPED IN A PLASTER BODY CAST AND FEELING THE SUN ON MY FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME I SOAKED IT UP AND I THOUGHT HOW COULD I EVER HAVE TAKEN THIS FOR GRANTED
JanineShepherd_2012X I FELT SO INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR MY LIFE
JanineShepherd_2012X BUT BEFORE I LEFT THE HOSPITAL THE HEAD NURSE HAD SAID TO ME JANINE I WANT YOU TO BE READY BECAUSE
JanineShepherd_2012X WHEN YOU GET HOME SOMETHING 'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND I SAID WHAT AND SHE SAID
JanineShepherd_2012X YOU 'RE GOING TO GET DEPRESSED
JanineShepherd_2012X AND I SAID NOT ME NOT JANINE THE MACHINE WHICH WAS MY NICKNAME SHE SAID YOU ARE BECAUSE SEE IT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE IN THE SPINAL WARD
JanineShepherd_2012X THAT 'S NORMAL YOU 'RE IN A WHEELCHAIR THAT 'S NORMAL BUT YOU 'RE GOING TO GET HOME AND REALIZE
JanineShepherd_2012X HOW DIFFERENT LIFE IS AND I GOT HOME
JanineShepherd_2012X AND SOMETHING HAPPENED
JanineShepherd_2012X I REALIZED SISTER SAM WAS RIGHT
JanineShepherd_2012X I DID GET DEPRESSED I WAS IN MY WHEELCHAIR I HAD NO FEELING FROM THE WAIST DOWN ATTACHED TO A CATHETER BOTTLE I COULDN 'T WALK
JanineShepherd_2012X I 'D LOST SO MUCH WEIGHT IN THE HOSPITAL I NOW WEIGHED ABOUT EIGHTY POUNDS AND I WANTED TO GIVE UP
JanineShepherd_2012X AND THE QUESTION I ASKED WAS WHY ME
JanineShepherd_2012X I KNEW IT WOULD BE CHALLENGING BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY A BLESSING BECAUSE
JanineShepherd_2012X SHE WAS ALWAYS HAPPY AND EVEN WHEN SHE BEGAN TO TALK AGAIN ALBEIT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND SHE NEVER COMPLAINED NOT ONCE
JanineShepherd_2012X AND I WONDERED HOW HAD SHE EVER FOUND THAT LEVEL OF ACCEPTANCE AND I REALIZED
JanineShepherd_2012X THAT THIS WASN 'T JUST MY LIFE IT WAS LIFE ITSELF I REALIZED THAT THIS WASN 'T JUST MY PAIN IT WAS EVERYBODY 'S PAIN
JanineShepherd_2012X AND THEN I KNEW JUST LIKE BEFORE THAT I HAD A CHOICE
JanineShepherd_2012X BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY LIFE AND THEN I STOPPED ASKING WHY ME AND I STARTED TO ASK WHY NOT ME
JanineShepherd_2012X AND THEN I THOUGHT TO MYSELF
JanineShepherd_2012X MAYBE BEING AT ROCK BOTTOM IS ACTUALLY THE PERFECT PLACE TO START
JanineShepherd_2012X I HAD NEVER BEFORE THOUGHT OF MYSELF AS A CREATIVE PERSON I WAS AN ATHLETE MY BODY WAS A MACHINE
JanineShepherd_2012X BUT NOW
JanineShepherd_2012X AND EVEN THOUGH I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IN THAT UNCERTAINTY CAME A SENSE OF FREEDOM
JanineShepherd_2012X I WAS NO LONGER TIED TO A SET PATH I WAS FREE TO EXPLORE LIFE 'S INFINITE POSSIBILITIES
JanineShepherd_2012X AND THAT REALIZATION
JanineShepherd_2012X WAS ABOUT TO CHANGE MY LIFE
JanineShepherd_2012X SITTING AT HOME
JanineShepherd_2012X IN MY WHEELCHAIR AND MY PLASTER BODY CAST AN AIRPLANE FLEW OVERHEAD
JanineShepherd_2012X AND I LOOKED UP AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT
JanineShepherd_2012X IT WAS BEAUTIFUL THEY LIFTED ME INTO THE COCKPIT THEY HAD TO SLIDE ME UP ON THE WING PUT ME IN THE COCKPIT THEY SAT ME DOWN THERE
JanineShepherd_2012X AND THE WHEELS LIFTED UP OFF THE TARMAC AND WE BECAME AIRBORNE
JanineShepherd_2012X I HAD THE MOST INCREDIBLE SENSE OF FREEDOM
JanineShepherd_2012X AND I SAID YEAH AND HE SAID WELL YOU TAKE THE CONTROLS AND YOU FLY TOWARDS THAT MOUNTAIN AND AS I LOOKED UP I REALIZED
JanineShepherd_2012X THAT HE WAS POINTING TOWARDS THE BLUE MOUNTAINS
JanineShepherd_2012X AND I TOOK THE CONTROLS
JanineShepherd_2012X AND I WAS FLYING
JanineShepherd_2012X AND I WAS A LONG LONG WAY FROM THAT SPINAL WARD AND I KNEW RIGHT THEN THAT I WAS GOING TO BE A PILOT
JanineShepherd_2012X BUT I 'D WORRY ABOUT THAT LATER BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I HAD A DREAM SO I WENT HOME I GOT A TRAINING DIARY OUT AND I HAD A PLAN
JanineShepherd_2012X AND I PRACTICED MY WALKING AS MUCH AS I COULD AND I WENT FROM THE POINT OF TWO PEOPLE HOLDING ME UP
JanineShepherd_2012X TO ONE PERSON HOLDING ME UP
JanineShepherd_2012X SO WHILE THE DOCTORS CONTINUED TO OPERATE AND PUT MY BODY BACK
JanineShepherd_2012X TOGETHER AGAIN I WENT ON WITH MY THEORY STUDY
JanineShepherd_2012X AND THEN EVENTUALLY AND AMAZINGLY
JanineShepherd_2012X AND THEN I LEARNED TO FLY AN AIRPLANE WITH TWO ENGINES AND I GOT MY TWIN ENGINE RATING AND THEN I
JanineShepherd_2012X LEARNED TO FLY IN BAD WEATHER AS WELL AS FINE WEATHER AND GOT MY INSTRUMENT RATING
JanineShepherd_2012X AND THEN I GOT MY COMMERCIAL PILOT 'S LICENSE AND THEN I GOT MY INSTRUCTOR RATING AND THEN I FOUND MYSELF BACK AT THAT SAME SCHOOL WHERE I 'D GONE FOR THAT VERY FIRST FLIGHT
JanineShepherd_2012X TEACHING OTHER PEOPLE HOW TO FLY
JanineShepherd_2012X JUST UNDER EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER I 'D LEFT THE SPINAL WARD
JanineShepherd_2012X BUT THEN I KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT ALTHOUGH MY BODY MIGHT BE LIMITED
JanineShepherd_2012X IT WAS MY SPIRIT THAT WAS UNSTOPPABLE
JanineShepherd_2012X THE PHILOSOPHER LAO TZU ONCE SAID
JanineShepherd_2012X WHEN YOU LET GO OF WHAT YOU ARE YOU BECOME WHAT YOU MIGHT BE
JanineShepherd_2012X I NOW KNOW THAT IT WASN 'T UNTIL I LET GO OF WHO I THOUGHT I WAS THAT I WAS ABLE TO CREATE A COMPLETELY NEW LIFE IT WASN 'T UNTIL I LET GO OF
JanineShepherd_2012X THE LIFE I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE
JanineShepherd_2012X I NOW KNOW THAT MY REAL STRENGTH NEVER CAME FROM MY BODY
JanineShepherd_2012X AND ALTHOUGH MY PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY
JanineShepherd_2012X I KNOW THAT I 'M NOT MY BODY
JanineShepherd_2012X AND I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU 'RE NOT YOURS
JanineShepherd_2012X AND THEN IT NO LONGER MATTERS WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE
JanineShepherd_2012X WHERE YOU COME FROM
JanineShepherd_2012X ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO FAN THE FLAME OF HUMANITY
JanineShepherd_2012X BY LIVING OUR LIVES AS THE ULTIMATE CREATIVE EXPRESSION OF WHO WE REALLY ARE BECAUSE WE ARE ALL CONNECTED BY MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF STRAWS
JanineShepherd_2012X AND IT 'S TIME TO JOIN THOSE UP AND TO HANG ON
JanineShepherd_2012X AND IF WE ARE TO MOVE TOWARDS OUR COLLECTIVE BLISS IT 'S TIME WE SHED OUR FOCUS ON THE PHYSICAL AND INSTEAD EMBRACE THE VIRTUES OF THE HEART SO RAISE YOUR STRAWS IF YOU 'LL JOIN ME
