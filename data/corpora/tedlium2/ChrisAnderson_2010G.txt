ChrisAnderson_2010G@29.89:36.75 AND I'M ALSO A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT THIS THERE ARE NINE BILLION HUMANS COMING OUR WAY
ChrisAnderson_2010G@37.05:46.06 THE MOST OPTIMISTIC DREAMS CAN GET DENTED BY THE PROSPECT OF PEOPLE PLUNDERING THE PLANET BUT RECENTLY
ChrisAnderson_2010G@46.28:53.92 I'VE BECOME INTRIGUED BY A DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING OF LARGE HUMAN CROWDS BECAUSE THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THEY CAN DO SOMETHING REALLY COOL
ChrisAnderson_2010G@54.32:65.58 IT'S A PHENOMENON THAT I THINK ANY ORGANIZATION OR INDIVIDUAL CAN TAP INTO IT CERTAINLY IMPACTED THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT TED 'S FUTURE AND PERHAPS THE WORLD 'S FUTURE OVERALL
ChrisAnderson_2010G@66.17:73.89 SO LET 'S EXPLORE THE STORY STARTS WITH JUST A SINGLE PERSON A CHILD BEHAVING A LITTLE STRANGELY THIS
ChrisAnderson_2010G@81.94:87.50 HOW DID HE LEARN THEM AND WHAT DROVE HIM TO SPEND THE HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF PRACTICE THIS MUST
ChrisAnderson_2010G@97.10:99.21 SO THAT WAS SENT TO ME BY THIS
ChrisAnderson_2010G@110.56:117.60 IN ESSENCE DANCERS WERE CHALLENGING EACH OTHER ONLINE TO GET BETTER INCREDIBLE NEW DANCE SKILLS WERE BEING INVENTED
ChrisAnderson_2010G@117.94:127.96 EVEN THE SIX YEAR OLDS WERE JOINING IN IT FELT LIKE A REVOLUTION AND SO JON HAD A BRILLIANT IDEA HE WENT OUT TO RECRUIT THE BEST OF THE BEST DANCERS OFF OF YOUTUBE TO
ChrisAnderson_2010G@130.34:134.18 THIS DANCE TROUPE THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY DANCERS THE LXD
ChrisAnderson_2010G@134.81:135.45 THESE KIDS WERE
ChrisAnderson_2010G@136.71:139.18 THEY WERE SO GOOD THAT THEY GOT TO PLAY AT THE
ChrisAnderson_2010G@140.56:144.49 AND AT TED HERE IN FEBRUARY THEIR PASSION AND BRILLIANCE JUST TOOK OUR BREATH AWAY
ChrisAnderson_2010G@147.67:150.02 THIS STORY OF THE EVOLUTION OF
ChrisAnderson_2010G@151.04:163.62 SEEMS STRANGELY FAMILIAR YOU KNOW A WHILE AFTER TEDTALKS STARTED TAKING OFF WE NOTICED THAT SPEAKERS WERE STARTING TO SPEND A LOT MORE TIME IN PREPARATION IT WAS RESULTING IN INCREDIBLE NEW TALKS LIKE THESE TWO
ChrisAnderson_2010G@164.35:172.38 MONTHS OF PREPARATION CRAMMED INTO EIGHTEEN MINUTES RAISING THE BAR CRUELLY FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF SPEAKERS WITH THE EFFECTS THAT WE'VE SEEN THIS WEEK
ChrisAnderson_2010G@172.90:182.91 IT'S NOT AS IF J J AND JILL ACTUALLY ENDED THEIR TALKS SAYING STEP YOUR GAME UP BUT THEY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SO IN BOTH OF THESE CASES YOU'VE GOT
ChrisAnderson_2010G@183.46:193.52 THESE CYCLES OF IMPROVEMENT APPARENTLY DRIVEN BY PEOPLE WATCHING WEB VIDEO WHAT IS GOING ON HERE WELL I THINK IT'S THE LATEST ITERATION OF A PHENOMENON WE CAN CALL
ChrisAnderson_2010G@194.20:206.88 CROWD ACCELERATED INNOVATION AND THERE ARE JUST THREE THINGS YOU NEED FOR THIS THING TO KICK INTO GEAR YOU CAN THINK OF THEM AS THREE DIALS ON A GIANT WHEEL YOU TURN UP THE DIALS THE WHEEL STARTS TO
ChrisAnderson_2010G@207.89:217.21 AND THE FIRS THING YOU NEED IS A CROWD A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO SHARE A COMMON INTEREST THE BIGGER THE CROWD THE MORE POTENTIAL INNOVATORS THERE ARE
ChrisAnderson_2010G@226.41:238.29 THE SECOND THING YOU NEED IS LIGHT YOU NEED CLEAR OPEN VISIBILITY OF WHAT THE BEST PEOPLE IN THAT CROWD ARE CAPABLE OF BECAUSE THAT IS HOW YOU WILL LEARN HOW YOU WILL BE EMPOWERED TO PARTICIPATE AND
ChrisAnderson_2010G@241.98:248.49 HARD WORK IT'S BASED ON HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF RESEARCH OF PRACTICE ABSENT DESIRE NOT GOING TO HAPPEN NOW
ChrisAnderson_2010G@248.99:256.35 HERE 'S AN EXAMPLE PRE INTERNET OF THIS MACHINE IN ACTION DANCERS AT A STREET CORNER IT'S A CROWD A SMALL ONE
ChrisAnderson_2010G@256.73:269.06 BUT THEY CAN ALL OBVIOUSLY SEE WHAT EACH OTHER CAN DO AND THE DESIRE PART COMES I GUESS FROM SOCIAL STATUS RIGHT BEST DANCER WALKS TALL GETS THE BEST DATE THERE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE SOME INNOVATION HAPPENING HERE
ChrisAnderson_2010G@269.54:276.92 BUT ON THE WEB ALL THREE DIALS ARE RATCHETED RIGHT UP THE DANCE COMMUNITY IS NOW GLOBAL THERE'S MILLIONS CONNECTED
ChrisAnderson_2010G@277.42:284.52 AND AMAZINGLY YOU CAN STILL SEE WHAT THE BEST CAN DO BECAUSE THE CROWD ITSELF SHINES A LIGHT ON THEM
ChrisAnderson_2010G@286.21:294.36 DIRECTLY THROUGH COMMENTS RATINGS EMAIL FACEBOOK TWITTER OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH NUMBERS OF VIEWS
ChrisAnderson_2010G@305.54:316.71 THE DESIRE ELEMENT IS REALLY DIALED WAY UP I MEAN YOU MIGHT JUST BE A KID WITH A WEBCAM BUT IF YOU CAN DO SOMETHING THAT GOES VIRAL
ChrisAnderson_2010G@317.52:330.86 YOU GET TO BE SEEN BY THE EQUIVALENT OF SPORTS STADIUMS CRAMMED WITH PEOPLE YOU GET HUNDREDS OF STRANGERS WRITING EXCITEDLY ABOUT YOU AND EVEN IF IT'S NOT THAT ELOQUENT AND IT'S NOT IT CAN STILL REALLY MAKE YOUR DAY
ChrisAnderson_2010G@331.95:340.23 SO THIS POSSIBILITY OF A NEW TYPE OF GLOBAL RECOGNITION I THINK IS DRIVING HUGE AMOUNTS OF
ChrisAnderson_2010G@341.49:351.58 AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE STARS WHO ARE BENEFITING BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE THE BEST EVERYONE CAN LEARN ALSO THE SYSTEM IS SELF FUELING IT'S THE CROWD
ChrisAnderson_2010G@351.86:361.14 THAT SHINES THE LIGHT AND FUELS THE DESIRE BUT THE LIGHT AND DESIRE ARE A LETHAL ONE TWO COMBINATION THAT ATTRACT NEW PEOPLE TO THE CROWD SO THIS IS A MODEL
ChrisAnderson_2010G@362.05:372.05 ANY ORGANIZATION COULD USE TO TRY AND NURTURE ITS OWN CYCLE OF CROWD ACCELERATED INNOVATION INVITE THE CROWD LET IN THE LIGHT DIAL UP THE
ChrisAnderson_2010G@383.36:395.43 IT'S BY GIVING AWAY WHAT YOU THINK IS YOUR DEEPEST SECRET THAT MAYBE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE EMPOWERED TO HELP IMPROVE IT AND VERY HAPPILY THERE'S ONE CLASS OF PEOPLE WHO REALLY CAN'T MAKE USE OF THIS TOOL
ChrisAnderson_2010G@395.87:405.87 THE DARK SIDE OF THE WEB IS ALLERGIC TO THE LIGHT I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE TERRORISTS FOR EXAMPLE PUBLISHING THEIR PLANS ONLINE AND SAYING TO THE WORLD PLEASE COULD YOU HELP US TO ACTUALLY MAKE THEM WORK THIS TIME
ChrisAnderson_2010G@407.33:415.02 YOU CAN PUBLISH YOUR STUFF ONLINE AND IF YOU CAN GET THAT WHEEL TO TURN LOOK OUT SO
ChrisAnderson_2010G@415.15:422.66 AT TED WE'VE BECOME A LITTLE OBSESSED WITH THIS IDEA OF OPENNESS IN FACT MY COLLEAGUE JUNE COHEN HAS TAKEN TO CALLING IT RADICAL OPENNESS
ChrisAnderson_2010G@423.07:431.44 BECAUSE IT WORKS FOR US EACH TIME WE OPENED UP OUR TALKS TO THE WORLD AND SUDDENLY THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE HELPING SPREAD OUR SPEAKERS IDEAS
ChrisAnderson_2010G@431.79:443.12 AND THEREBY MAKING IT EASIER FOR US TO RECRUIT AND MOTIVATE THE NEXT GENERATION OF SPEAKERS BY OPENING UP OUR TRANSLATION PROGRAM THOUSANDS OF HEROIC VOLUNTEERS SOME OF THEM WATCHING ONLINE RIGHT NOW AND THANK YOU
ChrisAnderson_2010G@444.01:453.28 HAVE TRANSLATED OUR TALKS INTO MORE THAN SEVENTY LANGUAGES THEREBY TRIPLING OUR VIEWERSHIP IN NON ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES BY GIVING AWAY OUR TEDX BRAND
ChrisAnderson_2010G@453.76:463.83 WE SUDDENLY HAVE A THOUSAND PLUS LIVE EXPERIMENTS IN THE ART OF SPREADING IDEAS AND THESE ORGANIZERS THEY'RE SEEING EACH OTHER THEY'RE LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER
ChrisAnderson_2010G@473.14:478.83 IT'S REALLY NOT NEWS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT INNOVATION EMERGES OUT OF GROUPS YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD THAT
ChrisAnderson_2010G@479.11:487.63 THIS WEEK THIS ROMANTIC NOTION OF THE LONE GENIUS WITH THE EUREKA MOMENT THAT CHANGES THE WORLD IS MISLEADING EVEN HE SAID THAT AND HE WOULD
ChrisAnderson_2010G@489.85:498.82 A SOCIAL SPECIES WE SPARK OFF EACH OTHER IT'S ALSO NOT NEWS TO SAY THAT THE INTERNET HAS ACCELERATED INNOVATION
ChrisAnderson_2010G@499.13:512.28 FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS POWERFUL COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN CONNECTING ONLINE SPARKING OFF EACH OTHER IF YOU TAKE PROGRAMMERS YOU KNOW THE WHOLE OPEN SOURCE MOVEMENT IS A FANTASTIC INSTANCE OF CROWD ACCELERATED INNOVATION
ChrisAnderson_2010G@513.38:525.88 WHAT'S KEY HERE IS THE REASON THESE GROUPS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONNECT IS BECAUSE THEIR WORK OUTPUT IS OF THE TYPE THAT CAN BE EASILY SHARED DIGITALLY A PICTURE A MUSIC FILE SOFTWARE
ChrisAnderson_2010G@528.30:535.58 AND THAT'S WHY WHAT I'M EXCITED ABOUT AND WHAT I THINK IS UNDER REPORTED IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RISE OF
ChrisAnderson_2010G@536.26:549.60 ONLINE VIDEO THIS IS THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW THE REST OF THE WORLD 'S TALENTS TO BE SHARED DIGITALLY THEREBY LAUNCHING A WHOLE NEW CYCLE OF CROWD ACCELERATED INNOVATION THE FIRST
ChrisAnderson_2010G@549.95:557.20 FEW YEARS OF THE WEB WERE PRETTY MUCH VIDEO FREE FOR THIS REASON VIDEO FILES ARE HUGE THE WEB COULDN'T HANDLE THEM BUT IN THE LAST TEN YEARS
ChrisAnderson_2010G@565.66:575.88 CISCO ACTUALLY ESTIMATES THAT WITHIN FOUR YEARS MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF THE WEB 'S DATA WILL BE VIDEO IF IT'S ALL PUPPIES PORN AND PIRACY WE'RE DOOMED
ChrisAnderson_2010G@576.82:583.87 I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE VIDEO IS HIGH BANDWIDTH FOR A REASON IT PACKS A HUGE AMOUNT OF DATA
ChrisAnderson_2010G@584.13:589.99 AND OUR BRAINS ARE UNIQUELY WIRED TO DECODE IT HERE LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO SAM HABER
ChrisAnderson_2010G@602.36:614.81 LOOKING AT VIDEO CLIPS POSTED BY STRANGERS A WORLD OF POSSIBILITY OPENS UP FOR HIM SUDDENLY HE STARTS TO EMULATE AND THEN TO INNOVATE AND A GLOBAL COMMUNITY OF UNICYCLISTS DISCOVER EACH OTHER ONLINE INSPIRE EACH OTHER TO GREATNESS
ChrisAnderson_2010G@615.24:623.42 AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF OTHER EXAMPLES OF THIS HAPPENING OF VIDEO DRIVEN EVOLUTION OF SKILLS RANGING FROM THE PHYSICAL TO THE
ChrisAnderson_2010G@624.04:631.71 AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU AS A FORMER PUBLISHER OF HOBBYIST MAGAZINES I FIND THIS STRANGELY BEAUTIFUL I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF PASSION RIGHT HERE ON THIS SCREEN
ChrisAnderson_2010G@633.21:640.70 BUT IF RUBE GOLDBERG MACHINES AND VIDEO POETRY AREN'T QUITE YOUR CUP OF TEA HOW ABOUT THIS
ChrisAnderson_2010G@642.09:648.85 JOVE IS A WEBSITE THAT WAS FOUNDED TO ENCOURAGE SCIENTISTS TO PUBLISH THEIR PEER REVIEWED RESEARCH ON VIDEO
ChrisAnderson_2010G@670.84:682.78 IF YOU CAN SHOW INSTEAD OF JUST DESCRIBING THAT PROBLEM GOES AWAY SO IT'S NOT FAR FETCHED TO SAY THAT AT SOME POINT ONLINE VIDEO IS GOING TO DRAMATICALLY ACCELERATE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE
ChrisAnderson_2010G@683.78:695.83 HERE 'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT'S CLOSE TO OUR HEARTS AT TED WHERE VIDEO IS SOMETIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN PRINT THE SHARING OF AN IDEA WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE WATCHING
ChrisAnderson_2010G@697.20:703.68 ALL THOSE IDEAS ARE ALREADY OUT THERE IN PRINT IT'S ACTUALLY FASTER TO READ THAN TO VIEW WHY WOULD SOMEONE BOTHER
ChrisAnderson_2010G@704.68:716.09 WELL SO THERE'S SOME SHOWING AS WELL AS TELLING BUT EVEN LEAVING THE SCREEN OUT OF IT THERE'S STILL A LOT MORE BEING TRANSFERRED THAN JUST WORDS AND IN THAT NON VERBAL PORTION THERE'S SOME SERIOUS MAGIC
ChrisAnderson_2010G@716.84:724.24 SOMEWHERE HIDDEN IN THE PHYSICAL GESTURES THE VOCAL CADENCE THE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS THE EYE CONTACT
ChrisAnderson_2010G@725.26:739.19 THE PASSION THE KIND OF AWKWARD BRITISH BODY LANGUAGE THE SENSE OF HOW THE AUDIENCE ARE REACTING THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF SUBCONSCIOUS CLUES THAT GO TO HOW WELL YOU WILL UNDERSTAND AND WHETHER YOU'RE INSPIRED
ChrisAnderson_2010G@740.06:748.05 LIGHT IF YOU LIKE AND DESIRE INCREDIBLY ALL OF THIS CAN BE COMMUNICATED ON JUST A FEW SQUARE INCHES OF A SCREEN
ChrisAnderson_2010G@765.63:775.75 THIS IS THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE OF THE HUMAN SUPERORGANISM IN ACTION IT'S PROBABLY DRIVEN OUR CULTURE FOR MILLENNIA FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IT RAN INTO A COMPETITOR WITH A LETHAL ADVANTAGE
ChrisAnderson_2010G@790.08:798.85 BUT NOW IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE THE GAME HAS CHANGED AGAIN IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT WHAT GUTENBERG DID FOR WRITING
ChrisAnderson_2010G@808.32:821.70 THAT JUST WENT GLOBAL NOW THIS IS BIG WE MAY HAVE TO REINVENT AN ANCIENT ART FORM I MEAN TODAY ONE PERSON SPEAKING CAN BE SEEN BY MILLIONS
ChrisAnderson_2010G@822.64:831.17 SHEDDING BRIGHT LIGHT ON POTENT IDEAS CREATING INTENSE DESIRE FOR LEARNING AND TO RESPOND AND IN HIS CASE INTENSE DESIRE TO
ChrisAnderson_2010G@832.54:846.54 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HUMAN HISTORY TALENTED STUDENTS DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THEIR POTENTIAL AND THEIR DREAMS WRITTEN OUT OF HISTORY BY LOUSY TEACHERS THEY CAN SIT TWO FEET IN FRONT OF THE WORLD 'S FINEST
ChrisAnderson_2010G@847.34:858.58 NOW TED IS JUST A SMALL PART OF THIS I MEAN THE WORLD 'S UNIVERSITIES ARE OPENING UP THEIR CURRICULA THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE SHARING THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ONLINE
ChrisAnderson_2010G@881.21:890.68 SO WE'RE DREAMING OF WAYS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU THE GLOBAL TED COMMUNITY TO RESPOND TO SPEAKERS TO CONTRIBUTE YOUR OWN IDEAS MAYBE EVEN YOUR OWN
ChrisAnderson_2010G@892.30:900.18 AND TO HELP SHINE A LIGHT ON THE VERY BEST OF WHAT'S OUT THERE BECAUSE IF WE CAN BUBBLE UP THE VERY BEST FROM A VASTLY LARGER POOL THIS WHEEL
ChrisAnderson_2010G@900.66:908.72 TURNS NOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE A SIMILAR PROCESS TO THIS HAPPENING TO GLOBAL EDUCATION OVERALL
ChrisAnderson_2010G@909.62:920.86 HAVE TO BE THIS PAINFUL TOP DOWN PROCESS WHY NOT A SELF FUELING CYCLE IN WHICH WE ALL CAN PARTICIPATE IT'S THE PARTICIPATION AGE RIGHT
ChrisAnderson_2010G@921.78:933.24 SCHOOLS CAN'T BE SILOS WE CAN'T STOP LEARNING AT AGE TWENTY ONE WHAT IF IN THE COMING CROWD OF NINE BILLION WHAT IF THAT CROWD
ChrisAnderson_2010G@933.91:946.82 COULD LEARN ENOUGH TO BE NET CONTRIBUTORS INSTEAD OF NET PLUNDERERS THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING RIGHT I MEAN THAT WOULD TAKE MORE TEACHERS THAN WE'VE EVER HAD BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THEY ARE OUT THERE
ChrisAnderson_2010G@960.88:961.07 TEACHER
ChrisAnderson_2010G@963.55:965.33 TEACHER
ChrisAnderson_2010G@967.34:979.23 PART OF THE CROWD THAT MAY BE ABOUT TO LAUNCH THE BIGGEST LEARNING CYCLE IN HUMAN HISTORY A CYCLE CAPABLE OF CARRYING ALL OF US TO A SMARTER WISER MORE BEAUTIFUL PLACE
ChrisAnderson_2010G@983.18:991.33 OF KIDS IN A VILLAGE IN PAKISTAN NEAR WHERE I GREW UP WITHIN FIVE YEARS EACH OF THESE KIDS IS GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO A CELLPHONE CAPABLE OF FULL ON WEB VIDEO
ChrisAnderson_2010G@994.51:1006.55 IT CRAZY TO THINK THAT THIS GIRL IN THE BACK AT THE RIGHT IN FIFTEEN YEARS MIGHT BE SHARING THE IDEA THAT KEEPS THE WORLD BEAUTIFUL FOR YOUR GRANDCHILDREN IT'S NOT CRAZY IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW
