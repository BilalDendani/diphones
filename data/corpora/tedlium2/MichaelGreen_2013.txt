MichaelGreen_2013@17.84:21.92 MY GRANDFATHER TAUGHT ME TO WORK WITH WOOD WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY
MichaelGreen_2013@22.17:29.93 AND HE ALSO TAUGHT ME THE IDEA THAT IF YOU CUT DOWN A TREE TO TURN IT INTO SOMETHING HONOR THAT TREE 'S LIFE AND MAKE IT AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU
MichaelGreen_2013@29.93:34.31 POSSIBLY CAN MY LITTLE BOY REMINDED ME
MichaelGreen_2013@35.45:45.05 THAT FOR ALL THE TECHNOLOGY AND ALL THE TOYS IN THE WORLD SOMETIMES JUST A SMALL BLOCK OF WOOD IF YOU STACK IT UP TALL ACTUALLY IS AN INCREDIBLY INSPIRING THING
MichaelGreen_2013@46.56:52.15 THESE ARE MY BUILDINGS I BUILD ALL AROUND THE WORLD OUT OF OUR OFFICE IN VANCOUVER AND NEW YORK
MichaelGreen_2013@52.68:61.78 AND WE BUILD BUILDINGS OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND STYLES AND DIFFERENT MATERIALS DEPENDING ON WHERE WE ARE BUT WOOD IS THE MATERIAL THAT I LOVE THE MOST AND I 'M GOING TO TELL YOU THE STORY ABOUT WOOD
MichaelGreen_2013@73.87:80.63 BUT I 'VE ACTUALLY SEEN THAT HAPPEN IN A WOOD BUILDING I 'VE ACTUALLY SEEN HOW PEOPLE TOUCH THE WOOD AND I THINK THERE 'S A REASON FOR IT
MichaelGreen_2013@81.04:90.03 JUST LIKE SNOWFLAKES NO TWO PIECES OF WOOD CAN EVER BE THE SAME ANYWHERE ON EARTH THAT 'S A WONDERFUL THING I LIKE TO THINK THAT WOOD
MichaelGreen_2013@90.4:94.22 GIVES MOTHER NATURE FINGERPRINTS IN OUR BUILDINGS
MichaelGreen_2013@94.45:99.17 IT 'S MOTHER NATURE 'S FINGERPRINTS THAT MAKE OUR BUILDINGS CONNECT US TO NATURE
MichaelGreen_2013@106.16:110.65 DOWN THE COAST HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE REDWOOD FOREST GROWS TO FORTY STORIES TALL
MichaelGreen_2013@111.9:117.13 BUT THE BUILDINGS THAT WE THINK ABOUT IN WOOD ARE ONLY FOUR STORIES TALL IN MOST PLACES ON EARTH
MichaelGreen_2013@117.4:121.29 EVEN BUILDING CODES ACTUALLY LIMIT THE ABILITY FOR US TO BUILD
MichaelGreen_2013@121.57:136.02 MUCH TALLER THAN FOUR STORIES IN MANY PLACES AND THAT 'S TRUE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES NOW THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME EXCEPTIONS AND THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE I 'M HOPING AND THE REASON I THINK THAT WAY IS THAT TODAY HALF OF US LIVE IN CITIES
MichaelGreen_2013@136.15:138.98 AND THAT NUMBER IS GOING TO GROW TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT
MichaelGreen_2013@139.44:143.43 CITIES AND DENSITY MEAN THAT OUR BUILDINGS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE BIG
MichaelGreen_2013@144.17:147.34 AND I THINK THERE 'S A ROLE FOR WOOD TO PLAY IN CITIES
MichaelGreen_2013@147.79:149.84 AND I FEEL THAT WAY BECAUSE
MichaelGreen_2013@150.05:155.26 THREE BILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TODAY OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS WILL NEED A NEW HOME
MichaelGreen_2013@155.37:159.37 THAT 'S FORTY PERCENT OF THE WORLD THAT ARE GOING TO NEED A NEW BUILDING BUILT FOR THEM IN THE NEXT
MichaelGreen_2013@159.67:165 TWENTY YEARS NOW ONE IN THREE PEOPLE LIVING IN CITIES TODAY ACTUALLY LIVE IN A SLUM
MichaelGreen_2013@168.98:171.2 A HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
MichaelGreen_2013@186.48:194.3 CITIES ARE BUILT IN THESE TWO MATERIALS STEEL AND CONCRETE AND THEY 'RE GREAT MATERIALS THEY 'RE THE MATERIALS OF THE LAST CENTURY
MichaelGreen_2013@194.42:198.61 BUT THEY 'RE ALSO MATERIALS WITH VERY HIGH ENERGY AND VERY HIGH GREENHOUSE GAS
MichaelGreen_2013@198.84:200.92 EMISSIONS IN THEIR PROCESS
MichaelGreen_2013@201.15:207.85 STEEL REPRESENTS ABOUT THREE PERCENT OF MAN 'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND CONCRETE IS OVER FIVE PERCENT
MichaelGreen_2013@208.29:216.97 SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT EIGHT PERCENT OF OUR CONTRIBUTION TO GREENHOUSE GASES TODAY COMES FROM THOSE TWO MATERIALS ALONE
MichaelGreen_2013@217.5:227.63 WE DON 'T THINK ABOUT IT A LOT AND UNFORTUNATELY WE ACTUALLY DON 'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUILDINGS I THINK AS MUCH AS WE SHOULD THIS IS A U S STATISTIC ABOUT THE IMPACT OF GREENHOUSE GASES
MichaelGreen_2013@227.63:238.63 ALMOST HALF OF OUR GREENHOUSE GASES ARE RELATED TO THE BUILDING INDUSTRY AND IF WE LOOK AT ENERGY IT 'S THE SAME STORY YOU 'LL NOTICE THAT TRANSPORTATION 'S SORT OF SECOND DOWN THAT LIST BUT THAT 'S THE CONVERSATION WE MOSTLY HEAR ABOUT
MichaelGreen_2013@238.9:242.16 AND ALTHOUGH A LOT OF THAT IS ABOUT ENERGY
MichaelGreen_2013@242.45:245.13 IT 'S ALSO SO MUCH ABOUT CARBON
MichaelGreen_2013@245.45:253.81 THE PROBLEM I SEE IS THAT ULTIMATELY THE CLASH OF HOW WE SOLVE THAT PROBLEM OF SERVING THOSE THREE BILLION PEOPLE THAT NEED A HOME
MichaelGreen_2013@254.1:259.56 AND CLIMATE CHANGE ARE A HEAD ON COLLISION ABOUT TO HAPPEN OR ALREADY HAPPENING
MichaelGreen_2013@260.49:274.57 THAT CHALLENGE MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO START THINKING IN NEW WAYS AND I THINK WOOD IS GOING TO BE PART OF THAT SOLUTION AND I 'M GOING TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF WHY AS AN ARCHITECT WOOD IS THE ONLY MATERIAL BIG MATERIAL THAT I CAN BUILD WITH THAT 'S ALREADY GROWN BY THE POWER OF THE SUN
MichaelGreen_2013@275.2:280.96 WHEN A TREE GROWS IN THE FOREST AND GIVES OFF OXYGEN AND SOAKS UP CARBON DIOXIDE
MichaelGreen_2013@281.21:283.87 AND IT DIES AND IT FALLS TO THE FOREST FLOOR
MichaelGreen_2013@284.29:293.42 IT GIVES THAT CARBON DIOXIDE BACK TO THE ATMOSPHERE OR INTO THE GROUND IF IT BURNS IN A FOREST FIRE IT 'S GOING TO GIVE THAT CARBON BACK TO THE ATMOSPHERE AS WELL
MichaelGreen_2013@305.77:308.18 ONE CUBIC METER OF WOOD
MichaelGreen_2013@308.31:311.41 WILL STORE ONE TONNE OF CARBON DIOXIDE
MichaelGreen_2013@311.91:321.73 NOW OUR TWO SOLUTIONS TO CLIMATE ARE OBVIOUSLY TO REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS AND FIND STORAGE WOOD IS THE ONLY MAJOR MATERIAL BUILDING MATERIAL I CAN BUILD WITH THAT ACTUALLY DOES BOTH THOSE TWO THINGS
MichaelGreen_2013@322.88:325.37 SO I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE
MichaelGreen_2013@325.76:332.24 AN ETHIC THAT THE EARTH GROWS OUR FOOD AND WE NEED TO MOVE TO AN ETHIC IN THIS CENTURY THAT THE EARTH SHOULD GROW OUR HOMES
MichaelGreen_2013@333.31:344.73 NOW HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT WHEN WE 'RE URBANIZING AT THIS RATE AND WE THINK ABOUT WOOD BUILDINGS ONLY AT FOUR STORIES WE NEED TO REDUCE THE CONCRETE AND STEEL AND WE NEED TO GROW BIGGER AND WHAT WE 'VE BEEN WORKING ON IS THIRTY STORY TALL
MichaelGreen_2013@345.47:347.11 BUILDINGS MADE OF WOOD
MichaelGreen_2013@347.87:353.61 WE 'VE BEEN ENGINEERING THEM WITH AN ENGINEER NAMED ERIC KARSH WHO WORKS WITH ME ON IT
MichaelGreen_2013@353.82:357.91 AND WE 'VE BEEN DOING THIS NEW WORK BECAUSE THERE ARE NEW WOOD PRODUCTS OUT THERE
MichaelGreen_2013@357.91:373.56 FOR US TO USE AND WE CALL THEM MASS TIMBER PANELS THESE ARE PANELS MADE WITH YOUNG TREES SMALL GROWTH TREES SMALL PIECES OF WOOD GLUED TOGETHER TO MAKE PANELS THAT ARE ENORMOUS EIGHT FEET WIDE SIXTY FOUR FEET LONG AND OF VARIOUS THICKNESSES
MichaelGreen_2013@373.59:392.59 THE WAY I DESCRIBE THIS BEST I 'VE FOUND IS TO SAY THAT WE 'RE ALL USED TO TWO BY FOUR CONSTRUCTION WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WOOD THAT 'S WHAT PEOPLE JUMP TO AS A CONCLUSION TWO BY FOUR CONSTRUCTION IS SORT OF LIKE THE LITTLE EIGHT DOT BRICKS OF LEGO THAT WE ALL PLAYED WITH AS KIDS AND YOU CAN MAKE ALL KINDS OF COOL THINGS OUT OF LEGO AT THAT SIZE AND OUT OF TWO BY FOURS
MichaelGreen_2013@392.59:404.53 BUT DO REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE A KID AND YOU KIND OF SIFTED THROUGH THE PILE IN YOUR BASEMENT AND YOU FOUND THAT BIG TWENTY FOUR DOT BRICK OF LEGO AND YOU WERE KIND OF LIKE COOL THIS IS AWESOME I CAN BUILD SOMETHING REALLY BIG AND THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT THAT 'S THE CHANGE
MichaelGreen_2013@404.53:415.44 MASS TIMBER PANELS ARE THOSE TWENTY FOUR DOT BRICKS THEY 'RE CHANGING THE SCALE OF WHAT WE CAN DO AND WHAT WE 'VE DEVELOPED IS SOMETHING WE CALL FFTT WHICH IS A CREATIVE COMMONS SOLUTION TO BUILDING
MichaelGreen_2013@419.22:424.95 OF BUILDING WITH THESE LARGE PANELS WHERE WE TILT UP SIX STORIES AT A TIME IF WE WANT TO
MichaelGreen_2013@425.82:440.21 THIS ANIMATION SHOWS YOU HOW THE BUILDING GOES TOGETHER IN A VERY SIMPLE WAY BUT THESE BUILDINGS ARE AVAILABLE FOR ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS NOW TO BUILD ON FOR DIFFERENT CULTURES IN THE WORLD DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURAL STYLES AND CHARACTERS IN ORDER FOR US
MichaelGreen_2013@440.7:449.4 TO BUILD SAFELY WE 'VE ENGINEERED THESE BUILDINGS ACTUALLY TO WORK IN A VANCOUVER CONTEXT WHERE WE 'RE A HIGH SEISMIC ZONE EVEN AT THIRTY STORIES TALL
MichaelGreen_2013@450.83:459.47 NOW OBVIOUSLY EVERY TIME I BRING THIS UP PEOPLE EVEN YOU KNOW HERE AT THE CONFERENCE SAY ARE YOU SERIOUS THIRTY STORIES HOW 'S THAT GOING TO HAPPEN AND THERE 'S A LOT OF REALLY
MichaelGreen_2013@459.47:478.96 GOOD QUESTIONS THAT ARE ASKED AND IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT WE SPENT QUITE A LONG TIME WORKING ON THE ANSWERS TO AS WE PUT TOGETHER OUR REPORT AND THE PEER REVIEWED REPORT I 'M JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON A FEW OF THEM AND LET 'S START WITH FIRE BECAUSE I THINK FIRE IS PROBABLY THE FIRST ONE THAT YOU 'RE ALL THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW FAIR ENOUGH AND THE WAY I DESCRIBE IT IS THIS IF I ASKED YOU TO TAKE A MATCH AND LIGHT IT
MichaelGreen_2013@478.96:491.58 AND HOLD UP A LOG AND TRY TO GET THAT LOG TO GO ON FIRE IT DOESN 'T HAPPEN RIGHT WE ALL KNOW THAT BUT TO BUILD A FIRE YOU KIND OF START WITH SMALL PIECES OF WOOD AND YOU WORK YOUR WAY UP AND EVENTUALLY YOU CAN ADD THE LOG TO THE FIRE
MichaelGreen_2013@491.66:495.86 AND WHEN YOU DO ADD THE LOG TO THE FIRE OF COURSE IT BURNS BUT IT BURNS SLOWLY
MichaelGreen_2013@496.35:511.92 WELL MASS TIMBER PANELS THESE NEW PRODUCTS THAT WE 'RE USING ARE MUCH LIKE THE LOG IT 'S HARD TO START THEM ON FIRE AND WHEN THEY DO THEY ACTUALLY BURN EXTRAORDINARILY PREDICTABLY AND WE CAN USE FIRE SCIENCE IN ORDER TO PREDICT AND MAKE THESE BUILDINGS AS SAFE AS CONCRETE AND AS SAFE AS STEEL
MichaelGreen_2013@513.45:517.75 THE NEXT BIG ISSUE DEFORESTATION EIGHTEEN PERCENT OF OUR
MichaelGreen_2013@517.75:524.95 CONTRIBUTION TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WORLDWIDE IS THE RESULT OF DEFORESTATION THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS CUT DOWN TREES
MichaelGreen_2013@526.01:529.42 OR THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS CUT DOWN THE WRONG TREES
MichaelGreen_2013@529.74:543.94 THERE ARE MODELS FOR SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY THAT ALLOW US TO CUT TREES PROPERLY AND THOSE ARE THE ONLY TREES APPROPRIATE TO USE FOR THESE KINDS OF SYSTEMS NOW I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THESE IDEAS WILL CHANGE THE ECONOMICS OF DEFORESTATION
MichaelGreen_2013@544.61:560.64 IN COUNTRIES WITH DEFORESTATION ISSUES WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO PROVIDE BETTER VALUE FOR THE FOREST AND ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO MAKE MONEY THROUGH VERY FAST GROWTH CYCLES TEN TWELVE FIFTEEN YEAR OLD TREES THAT MAKE THESE PRODUCTS AND ALLOW US TO BUILD AT THIS SCALE
MichaelGreen_2013@560.64:566.35 WE 'VE CALCULATED A TWENTY STORY BUILDING WE 'LL GROW ENOUGH WOOD IN NORTH AMERICA EVERY THIRTEEN MINUTES
MichaelGreen_2013@566.35:568.9 THAT 'S HOW MUCH IT TAKES
MichaelGreen_2013@569.16:571.7 THE CARBON STORY HERE IS A REALLY GOOD ONE
MichaelGreen_2013@571.82:587.53 IF WE BUILT A TWENTY STORY BUILDING OUT OF CEMENT AND CONCRETE THE PROCESS WOULD RESULT IN THE MANUFACTURING OF THAT CEMENT AND ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TONNES OF CARBON DIOXIDE IF WE DID IT IN WOOD IN THIS SOLUTION WE 'D SEQUESTER ABOUT THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TONNES FOR A NET DIFFERENCE OF FOUR THOUSAND THREE
MichaelGreen_2013@587.53:593.65 HUNDRED TONNES THAT 'S THE EQUIVALENT OF ABOUT NINE HUNDRED CARS REMOVED FROM THE ROAD IN ONE YEAR
MichaelGreen_2013@594.12:608.5 THINK BACK TO THAT THREE BILLION PEOPLE THAT NEED A NEW HOME AND MAYBE THIS IS A CONTRIBUTOR TO REDUCING WE 'RE AT THE BEGINNING OF A REVOLUTION I HOPE IN THE WAY WE BUILD BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST NEW WAY TO BUILD A SKYSCRAPER IN PROBABLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS OR MORE
MichaelGreen_2013@609.91:617.18 BUT THE CHALLENGE IS CHANGING SOCIETY 'S PERCEPTION OF POSSIBILITY AND IT 'S A HUGE CHALLENGE THE ENGINEERING IS TRUTHFULLY THE EASY PART OF THIS
MichaelGreen_2013@618.04:629.98 AND THE WAY I DESCRIBE IT IS THIS THE FIRST SKYSCRAPER TECHNICALLY AND THE DEFINITION OF A SKYSCRAPER IS TEN STORIES TALL BELIEVE IT OR NOT BUT THE FIRST SKYSCRAPER WAS THIS ONE IN CHICAGO AND PEOPLE WERE TERRIFIED TO WALK UNDERNEATH THIS BUILDING
MichaelGreen_2013@630.09:634.17 BUT ONLY FOUR YEARS AFTER IT WAS BUILT GUSTAVE EIFFEL WAS BUILDING THE EIFFEL TOWER
MichaelGreen_2013@634.57:640.02 AND AS HE BUILT THE EIFFEL TOWER HE CHANGED THE SKYLINES OF THE CITIES OF THE WORLD
MichaelGreen_2013@640.47:653.89 CHANGED AND CREATED A COMPETITION BETWEEN PLACES LIKE NEW YORK CITY AND CHICAGO WHERE DEVELOPERS STARTED BUILDING BIGGER AND BIGGER BUILDINGS AND PUSHING THE ENVELOPE UP HIGHER AND HIGHER WITH BETTER AND BETTER ENGINEERING
MichaelGreen_2013@654.43:670.58 WE BUILT THIS MODEL IN NEW YORK ACTUALLY AS A THEORETICAL MODEL ON THE CAMPUS OF A TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY SOON TO COME AND THE REASON WE PICKED THIS SITE TO JUST SHOW YOU WHAT THESE BUILDINGS MAY LOOK LIKE BECAUSE THE EXTERIOR CAN CHANGE IT 'S REALLY JUST THE STRUCTURE THAT WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT
MichaelGreen_2013@670.58:678.92 THE REASON WE PICKED IT IS BECAUSE THIS IS A TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY AND I BELIEVE THAT WOOD IS THE MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED MATERIAL I CAN BUILD WITH
MichaelGreen_2013@684.67:689.12 BUT THAT 'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE NATURE 'S FINGERPRINTS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
MichaelGreen_2013@690.37:694.55 I 'M LOOKING FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE AN EIFFEL TOWER
MichaelGreen_2013@694.55:705.89 WE CALL IT BUILDINGS ARE STARTING TO GO UP AROUND THE WORLD THERE 'S A BUILDING IN LONDON THAT 'S NINE STORIES A NEW BUILDING THAT JUST FINISHED IN AUSTRALIA THAT I BELIEVE IS TEN OR ELEVEN WE 'RE STARTING TO PUSH THE HEIGHT UP OF
MichaelGreen_2013@715.13:717.24 IN THE NOT SO DISTANT FUTURE
