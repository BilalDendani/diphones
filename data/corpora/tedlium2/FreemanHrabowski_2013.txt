FreemanHrabowski_2013 TALKING ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF MY CAMPUS THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE COUNTY UMBC IN EDUCATING STUDENTS OF ALL TYPES ACROSS THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES AND THE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING AREAS
FreemanHrabowski_2013 WHAT MAKES OUR STORY ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH
FreemanHrabowski_2013 FROM A GROUP OF STUDENTS WHO ARE TYPICALLY NOT AT THE TOP OF THE ACADEMIC LADDER STUDENTS OF COLOR STUDENTS UNDERREPRESENTED IN SELECTED AREAS
FreemanHrabowski_2013 AND WHAT MAKES THE STORY ESPECIALLY UNIQUE IS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED HOW TO HELP AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS LATINO STUDENTS STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME BACKGROUNDS TO BECOME SOME OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
FreemanHrabowski_2013 AND SO I BEGIN WITH A STORY ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD WE ALL ARE PRODUCTS OF OUR CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES
FreemanHrabowski_2013 IT 'S HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT IT 'S BEEN FIFTY YEARS SINCE I HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING A NINTH GRADE KID IN BIRMINGHAM ALABAMA
FreemanHrabowski_2013 A KID WHO WOULD SAY TO THE TEACHER WHEN THE TEACHER SAID HERE ARE TEN PROBLEMS TO THE CLASS
FreemanHrabowski_2013 THIS LITTLE FAT KID WOULD SAY GIVE US TEN MORE AND THE WHOLE CLASS WOULD SAY SHUT UP FREEMAN
FreemanHrabowski_2013 AND THERE WAS A DESIGNATED KICKER EVERY DAY AND SO I WAS ALWAYS ASKING THIS QUESTION WELL HOW COULD WE GET MORE KIDS TO REALLY LOVE TO LEARN
FreemanHrabowski_2013 AND AMAZINGLY ONE WEEK IN CHURCH WHEN I REALLY DIDN 'T WANT TO BE THERE AND I WAS IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM BEING PLACATED BY DOING MATH PROBLEMS
FreemanHrabowski_2013 I HEARD THIS MAN SAY THIS
FreemanHrabowski_2013 IF WE CAN GET THE CHILDREN
FreemanHrabowski_2013 TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION HERE IN BIRMINGHAM
FreemanHrabowski_2013 WE CAN SHOW AMERICA THAT EVEN CHILDREN KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG AND THAT CHILDREN REALLY DO WANT TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE EDUCATION AND I LOOKED UP AND SAID WHO IS THAT MAN AND THEY SAID HIS NAME WAS DR MARTIN LUTHER KING
FreemanHrabowski_2013 AND I SAID TO MY PARENTS I 'VE GOT TO GO I WANT TO GO I WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS AND THEY SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT
FreemanHrabowski_2013 THE MAN WANTS ME TO GO AND NOW YOU SAY NO AND THEY THOUGHT ABOUT IT ALL NIGHT AND THEY CAME INTO MY ROOM THE NEXT MORNING THEY HAD NOT SLEPT THEY HAD BEEN LITERALLY CRYING AND PRAYING AND THINKING WILL WE LET OUR TWELVE YEAR OLD
FreemanHrabowski_2013 PARTICIPATE IN THIS MARCH AND PROBABLY HAVE TO GO TO JAIL AND THEY DECIDED TO DO IT AND WHEN THEY CAME IN TO TELL ME I WAS AT FIRST ELATED AND THEN
FreemanHrabowski_2013 ALL OF A SUDDEN I BEGAN THINKING ABOUT THE DOGS AND THE FIRE HOSES AND I GOT REALLY SCARED I REALLY DID
FreemanHrabowski_2013 AND ONE OF THE POINTS I MAKE TO PEOPLE ALL THE TIME IS THAT SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE DO THINGS THAT ARE COURAGEOUS IT DOESN 'T REALLY MEAN THAT THEY 'RE THAT COURAGEOUS IT SIMPLY MEANS THAT THEY BELIEVE IT 'S IMPORTANT TO DO IT I WANTED A BETTER EDUCATION
FreemanHrabowski_2013 I DID NOT WANT TO HAVE TO HAVE HAND ME DOWN BOOKS I WANTED TO KNOW THAT THE SCHOOL I ATTENDED NOT ONLY HAD GOOD TEACHERS BUT THE RESOURCES WE NEEDED AND AS A RESULT OF THAT EXPERIENCE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK WHILE I WAS THERE IN JAIL DR KING CAME AND SAID WITH OUR PARENTS WHAT YOU CHILDREN DO THIS DAY WILL HAVE AN IMPACT
FreemanHrabowski_2013 ON CHILDREN WHO HAVE NOT BEEN BORN
FreemanHrabowski_2013 I RECENTLY REALIZED THAT TWO THIRDS OF AMERICANS TODAY HAD NOT BEEN BORN AT THE TIME OF ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE AND SO FOR THEM WHEN THEY HEAR ABOUT THE CHILDREN 'S CRUSADE IN BIRMINGHAM IN MANY WAYS IF THEY SEE IT ON TV IT 'S LIKE OUR LOOKING AT THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE LINCOLN MOVIE IT 'S HISTORY
FreemanHrabowski_2013 AND THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT LESSONS DID WE LEARN WELL AMAZINGLY THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR ME WAS THIS THAT CHILDREN CAN BE EMPOWERED
FreemanHrabowski_2013 TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THEIR EDUCATION
FreemanHrabowski_2013 MARYLAND IS THE SOUTH AS YOU KNOW AND QUITE FRANKLY IT WAS THE FIRST UNIVERSITY IN OUR STATE FOUNDED AT A TIME WHEN STUDENTS OF ALL RACES COULD GO THERE
FreemanHrabowski_2013 AND SO WE HAD BLACK AND WHITE STUDENTS AND OTHERS WHO BEGAN TO ATTEND AND IT HAS BEEN FOR FIFTY YEARS AN EXPERIMENT
FreemanHrabowski_2013 THE EXPERIMENT IS THIS IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE INSTITUTIONS IN OUR COUNTRY UNIVERSITIES WHERE PEOPLE FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS CAN COME AND LEARN AND LEARN TO WORK TOGETHER AND LEARN TO BECOME LEADERS AND TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN THAT EXPERIENCE
FreemanHrabowski_2013 NOW WHAT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE FOR ME IS THIS
FreemanHrabowski_2013 WE FOUND THAT WE COULD DO A LOT IN THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES AND SO WE BEGAN TO WORK ON THAT FOR YEARS IN THE SIXTY S AND WE PRODUCED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN LAW ALL THE WAY TO THE HUMANITIES WE PRODUCED GREAT ARTISTS BECKETT IS OUR MUSE A LOT OF OUR STUDENTS GET INTO THEATER IT 'S GREAT WORK
FreemanHrabowski_2013 THE PROBLEM THAT WE FACED WAS THE SAME PROBLEM AMERICA CONTINUES TO FACE THAT STUDENTS IN THE SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING BLACK STUDENTS WERE NOT SUCCEEDING BUT WHEN I LOOKED AT THE DATA WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT QUITE FRANKLY STUDENTS IN GENERAL LARGE NUMBERS WERE NOT MAKING IT
FreemanHrabowski_2013 AND AS A RESULT OF THAT WE DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP FIRST OF ALL THE GROUP AT THE BOTTOM
FreemanHrabowski_2013 AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS AND THEN HISPANIC STUDENTS AND ROBERT AND JANE MEYERHOFF PHILANTHROPISTS SAID WE 'D LIKE TO HELP ROBERT MEYERHOFF SAID WHY IS IT THAT EVERYTHING I SEE ON TV ABOUT BLACK BOYS IF IT 'S NOT ABOUT BASKETBALL IS NOT POSITIVE I 'D LIKE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO DO SOMETHING THAT 'S POSITIVE
FreemanHrabowski_2013 WE MARRIED THOSE IDEAS AND WE CREATED THIS MEYERHOFF SCHOLARS PROGRAM
FreemanHrabowski_2013 WHO BEGIN WITH MAJORS IN THOSE AREAS ACTUALLY
FreemanHrabowski_2013 SUCCEED AND GRADUATE IN THOSE AREAS AND ONLY FORTY TWO PERCENT OF ASIAN AMERICANS
FreemanHrabowski_2013 AND SO THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE CHALLENGE WELL A PART OF IT OF COURSE IS K TWELVE WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN K TWELVE BUT THE OTHER PART HAS TO DO WITH THE CULTURE OF SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ON OUR CAMPUSES WHETHER YOU KNOW IT OR NOT LARGE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS WITH HIGH SAT 'S AND LARGE NUMBERS OF A P CREDITS WHO GO TO THE
FreemanHrabowski_2013 MOST PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITIES IN OUR COUNTRY BEGIN IN PRE MED OR PRE ENGINEERING AND ENGINEERING AND THEY END UP CHANGING THEIR MAJORS
FreemanHrabowski_2013 AND THE NUMBER ONE REASON WE FIND QUITE FRANKLY IS THEY DID NOT DO WELL IN FIRST YEAR SCIENCE COURSES IN FACT WE CALL FIRST YEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
FreemanHrabowski_2013 TYPICALLY AROUND AMERICA WEED OUT COURSES OR BARRIER COURSES HOW MANY OF YOU IN THIS AUDIENCE KNOW SOMEBODY WHO STARTED OFF IN PRE MED OR ENGINEERING AND CHANGED THEIR MAJOR WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO IT 'S AN AMERICAN CHALLENGE HALF OF YOU IN THE ROOM I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW AND WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT THAT IS THAT SO MANY STUDENTS ARE SMART AND CAN DO IT
FreemanHrabowski_2013 WE NEED TO FIND WAYS OF MAKING IT HAPPEN SO WHAT ARE THE FOUR THINGS WE DID TO HELP MINORITY STUDENTS THAT NOW ARE HELPING STUDENTS IN GENERAL NUMBER ONE HIGH EXPECTATIONS IT TAKES AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE ACADEMIC PREPARATION OF STUDENTS
FreemanHrabowski_2013 THEIR GRADES THE RIGOR OF THE COURSE WORK THEIR TEST TAKING SKILLS THEIR ATTITUDE THE FIRE IN THEIR BELLY THE PASSION FOR THE WORK
FreemanHrabowski_2013 TO MAKE IT AND SO DOING THINGS TO HELP STUDENTS PREPARE TO BE IN THAT POSITION VERY IMPORTANT BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT IT TAKES AN UNDERSTANDING THAT IT 'S HARD WORK THAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE I DON 'T CARE HOW SMART YOU ARE OR HOW SMART YOU THINK YOU ARE SMART SIMPLY MEANS YOU 'RE READY TO LEARN
FreemanHrabowski_2013 YOU 'RE EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING AND YOU WANT TO ASK GOOD QUESTIONS I I RABI A NOBEL LAUREATE SAID THAT WHEN HE WAS GROWING UP IN NEW YORK ALL OF HIS FRIENDS PARENTS WOULD ASK THEM WHAT DID YOU LEARN IN SCHOOL AT THE END OF A DAY AND HE SAID IN CONTRAST
FreemanHrabowski_2013 HIS JEWISH MOTHER WOULD SAY IZZY DID YOU ASK A GOOD QUESTION TODAY
FreemanHrabowski_2013 AND SO HIGH EXPECTATIONS HAVE TO DO WITH CURIOSITY AND ENCOURAGING YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE CURIOUS AND AS A RESULT OF THOSE HIGH EXPECTATIONS WE BEGAN TO FIND STUDENTS WE WANTED TO WORK WITH TO SEE WHAT COULD WE DO TO HELP THEM NOT SIMPLY TO SURVIVE IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING BUT TO BECOME THE VERY BEST
FreemanHrabowski_2013 TO EXCEL INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH AN EXAMPLE ONE YOUNG MAN WHO EARNED A C IN THE FIRST COURSE AND WANTED TO GO ON TO MED SCHOOL WE SAID WE NEED TO HAVE YOU RETAKE THE COURSE
FreemanHrabowski_2013 SECONDLY IT 'S NOT ABOUT TEST SCORES ONLY TEST SCORES ARE IMPORTANT BUT THEY 'RE NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ONE YOUNG WOMAN HAD GREAT GRADES BUT TEST SCORES WERE NOT AS HIGH BUT SHE HAD A FACTOR THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT SHE NEVER MISSED A DAY OF SCHOOL K TWELVE THERE WAS FIRE IN THAT BELLY THAT YOUNG WOMAN WENT ON AND SHE IS TODAY WITH AN M D PH D FROM HOPKINS
FreemanHrabowski_2013 IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING WE TEND TO THINK CUTTHROAT STUDENTS ARE NOT TAUGHT TO WORK IN GROUPS AND THAT 'S WHAT WE WORK TO DO WITH THAT GROUP TO GET THEM TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER TO BUILD TRUST AMONG THEM TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER TO LEARN HOW TO ASK GOOD QUESTIONS
FreemanHrabowski_2013 BUT ALSO TO LEARN HOW TO EXPLAIN CONCEPTS WITH CLARITY AS YOU KNOW IT 'S ONE THING TO EARN AN A YOURSELF IT 'S ANOTHER THING TO HELP SOMEONE ELSE DO WELL AND SO TO FEEL THAT SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY
FreemanHrabowski_2013 MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD SO BUILDING COMMUNITY AMONG THOSE STUDENTS VERY IMPORTANT
FreemanHrabowski_2013 THIRD THE IDEA OF IT TAKES RESEARCHERS TO PRODUCE RESEARCHERS WHETHER YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT ARTISTS PRODUCING ARTISTS OR YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE GETTING INTO THE SOCIAL SCIENCES
FreemanHrabowski_2013 WHATEVER THE DISCIPLINE AND ESPECIALLY IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING AS IN ART FOR EXAMPLE YOU NEED SCIENTISTS TO PULL THE STUDENTS INTO THE WORK AND SO OUR STUDENTS ARE WORKING IN LABS REGULARLY AND ONE GREAT EXAMPLE THAT YOU 'LL APPRECIATE DURING A SNOWSTORM IN BALTIMORE SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE GUY ON OUR CAMPUS WITH THIS HOWARD HUGHES MEDICAL INSTITUTE GRANT
FreemanHrabowski_2013 LITERALLY CAME BACK TO WORK IN HIS LAB AFTER SEVERAL DAYS
FreemanHrabowski_2013 AND ALL THESE STUDENTS HAD REFUSED TO LEAVE THE LAB THEY HAD FOOD THEY HAD
FreemanHrabowski_2013 EACH ONE OF THEM FOCUSED ON THAT WORK AND HE SAID IT DOESN 'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT AND THEN FINALLY IF YOU 'VE GOT THE COMMUNITY AND YOU 'VE GOT THE HIGH EXPECTATIONS AND YOU 'VE GOT RESEARCHERS PRODUCING RESEARCHERS YOU HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING AS FACULTY TO GET INVOLVED WITH THOSE STUDENTS EVEN IN THE CLASSROOM I 'LL NEVER FORGET A FACULTY MEMBER CALLING THE STAFF AND SAYING
FreemanHrabowski_2013 EXCITED ABOUT THE WORK HE 'S NOT TAKING NOTES WE NEED TO TALK TO HIM WHAT WAS SIGNIFICANT WAS THAT THE FACULTY MEMBER WAS OBSERVING EVERY STUDENT
FreemanHrabowski_2013 TO UNDERSTAND WHO WAS REALLY INVOLVED AND WHO WAS NOT AND WAS SAYING LET ME SEE HOW I CAN WORK WITH THEM LET ME GET THE STAFF TO HELP ME OUT IT WAS THAT CONNECTING THAT YOUNG MAN TODAY IS ACTUALLY A FACULTY MEMBER M D PH D IN NEUROENGINEERING AT DUKE GIVE HIM A BIG HAND FOR THAT
FreemanHrabowski_2013 BECAUSE SO MANY STUDENTS ARE BORED IN CLASS
FreemanHrabowski_2013 DO YOU KNOW THAT MANY STUDENTS K TWELVE AND IN UNIVERSITIES DON 'T WANT TO JUST SIT THERE AND LISTEN TO SOMEBODY TALK THEY NEED TO BE ENGAGED AND SO WE HAVE DONE IF YOU LOOK AT OUR WEBSITE AT THE CHEMISTRY DISCOVERY CENTER YOU 'LL SEE PEOPLE COMING FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO LOOK AT HOW WE ARE REDESIGNING COURSES
FreemanHrabowski_2013 HAVING AN EMPHASIS ON COLLABORATION USE OF TECHNOLOGY USING PROBLEMS OUT OF OUR BIOTECH COMPANIES ON OUR CAMPUS AND NOT GIVING STUDENTS THE THEORIES BUT HAVING THEM STRUGGLE WITH THOSE THEORIES
FreemanHrabowski_2013 AND IT 'S WORKING SO WELL THAT THROUGHOUT OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN MARYLAND MORE AND MORE COURSES ARE BEING REDESIGNED IT 'S CALLED ACADEMIC INNOVATION AND WHAT DOES ALL OF THAT MEAN IT MEANS THAT NOW NOT JUST IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING WE NOW HAVE PROGRAMS IN THE ARTS IN THE HUMANITIES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES
FreemanHrabowski_2013 IN TEACHER EDUCATION EVEN PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN IN I T IF YOU DON 'T KNOW IT
FreemanHrabowski_2013 TELLING YOUNG WOMEN YOUNG MINORITY STUDENTS AND STUDENTS IN GENERAL YOU CAN DO THIS WORK AND MOST IMPORTANT GIVING THEM A CHANCE TO BUILD THAT COMMUNITY WITH FACULTY PULLING THEM INTO THE WORK AND OUR ASSESSING WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOES NOT WORK MOST IMPORTANT IF A STUDENT HAS A SENSE OF SELF
FreemanHrabowski_2013 IT IS AMAZING HOW THE DREAMS AND THE VALUES CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD WHEN I WAS A TWELVE YEAR OLD CHILD IN THE JAIL IN BIRMINGHAM I KEPT THINKING I WONDER WHAT MY FUTURE COULD BE
FreemanHrabowski_2013 I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THIS LITTLE BLACK BOY IN BIRMINGHAM TO ONE DAY BE PRESIDENT OF A UNIVERSITY THAT HAS STUDENTS FROM ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY COUNTRIES WHERE STUDENTS ARE NOT THERE JUST TO SURVIVE WHERE THEY LOVE LEARNING WHERE THEY ENJOY BEING THE BEST WHERE THEY WILL ONE DAY CHANGE THE WORLD
FreemanHrabowski_2013 ARISTOTLE SAID EXCELLENCE IS NEVER AN ACCIDENT IT IS THE RESULT OF HIGH INTENTION SINCERE EFFORT AND INTELLIGENT EXECUTION IT REPRESENTS THE WISEST OPTION AMONG MANY ALTERNATIVES AND THEN HE SAID SOMETHING THAT GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS HE SAID CHOICE
FreemanHrabowski_2013 NOT CHANCE DETERMINES YOUR DESTINY CHOICE NOT CHANCE DETERMINES YOUR DESTINY DREAMS
