PenelopeBoston_2006 CAREER THAT I STARTED EARLY ON IN MY LIFE WAS LOOKING FOR EXOTIC LIFE FORMS IN EXOTIC PLACES AND AT THAT TIME I WAS WORKING IN THE ANTARCTIC AND THE ARCTIC AND HIGH DESERTS AND LOW DESERTS
PenelopeBoston_2006 UNTIL ABOUT A DOZEN YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS REALLY CAPTURED BY CAVES AND I REALLY RE FOCUSED MOST OF MY RESEARCH IN THAT DIRECTION
PenelopeBoston_2006 SO I HAVE A REALLY COOL DAY JOB I GET TO DO SOME REALLY AMAZING STUFF I WORK IN SOME OF THE MOST EXTREME CAVE ENVIRONMENTS ON THE PLANET
PenelopeBoston_2006 MANY OF THEM ARE TRYING TO KILL US FROM THE MINUTE WE GO INTO THEM BUT NEVERTHELESS THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY GRIPPING AND CONTAIN UNBELIEVABLE BIOLOGICAL WONDERS THAT ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE THAT WE HAVE ON THE PLANET
PenelopeBoston_2006 ICY MOON AROUND JUPITER AND PERHAPS SOMEDAY FAR BEYOND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM ITSELF I'M VERY PASSIONATELY INTERESTED IN THE HUMAN FUTURE
PenelopeBoston_2006 ON THE MOON AND MARS PARTICULARLY AND ELSEWHERE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE TRANSITIONED TO A SOLAR SYSTEM GOING CIVILISATION AND SPECIES
PenelopeBoston_2006 AND AS AN OUTGROWTH OF ALL OF THIS THEN I WONDER ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN AND WHETHER WE EVEN SHOULD THINK ABOUT TRANSPORTING EARTH TYPE LIFE TO OTHER PLANETS NOTABLY MARS AS A FIRST EXAMPLE
PenelopeBoston_2006 BECAUSE IN THE MID NINETEEN FIFTIES WHEN I WAS A TINY CHILD THEY HAD THE AUDACITY TO LAUNCH A VERY PRIMITIVE LITTLE SATELLITE CALLED SPUTNIK WHICH SENT THE WESTERN WORLD INTO A HYSTERICAL TAILSPIN
PenelopeBoston_2006 AND A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY WENT INTO THE FUNDING OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS SKILLS FOR KIDS AND I'M A PRODUCT OF THAT GENERATION LIKE SO MANY OTHER OF MY PEERS
PenelopeBoston_2006 IT REALLY CAUGHT HOLD OF US AND CAUGHT FIRE AND IT WOULD BE LOVELY IF WE COULD REPRODUCE THAT AGAIN NOW OF COURSE REFUSING TO GROW UP EVEN THOUGH I IMPERSONATE A GROWN UP IN DAILY LIFE BUT I DO A FAIRLY GOOD JOB OF THAT
PenelopeBoston_2006 REALLY RETAINING THAT CHILDLIKE QUALITY OF NOT CARING WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN IS REALLY CRITICAL
PenelopeBoston_2006 THE NEXT ELEMENT IS THE FACT THAT I HAVE APPLIED A VALUE JUDGEMENT AND MY VALUE JUDGMENT IS THAT THE PRESENCE OF LIFE IS BETTER THAN
PenelopeBoston_2006 NO LIFE AND SO LIFE IS MORE VALUABLE THAN NO LIFE AND SO I THINK THAT THAT HOLDS TOGETHER A GREAT DEAL OF THE WORK THAT PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE APPROACH
PenelopeBoston_2006 I'M VERY INTERESTED IN MARS OF COURSE AND THAT WAS A PRODUCT OF MY BEING A YOUNG UNDERGRADUATE WHEN THE VIKING LANDERS LANDED ON MARS
PenelopeBoston_2006 AND THAT TOOK WHAT HAD BEEN A TINY LITTLE ASTRONOMICAL OBJECT IN THE SKY THAT YOU WOULD SEE AS A DOT AND TURNED IT
PenelopeBoston_2006 INTO A LANDSCAPE AS THAT VERY FIRST PRIMITIVE PICTURE CAME RASTERING ACROSS THE SCREEN AND WHEN IT BECAME A LANDSCAPE IT ALSO BECAME A DESTINATION AND ALTERED REALLY THE COURSE OF MY LIFE
PenelopeBoston_2006 IN MY GRADUATE YEARS I WORKED WITH MY COLLEAGUE AND MENTOR AND FRIEND STEVE SCHNEIDER AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH WORKING ON GLOBAL CHANGE ISSUES
PenelopeBoston_2006 WE'VE WRITTEN A NUMBER OF THINGS ON THE ROLE OF GAIA HYPOTHESIS WHETHER OR NOT YOU COULD CONSIDER EARTH AS A SINGLE ENTITY IN ANY MEANINGFUL SCIENTIFIC SENSE AND THEN AS AN OUTGROWTH OF THAT I WORKED ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES OF NUCLEAR WAR
PenelopeBoston_2006 SO WONDERFUL THINGS AND GRIM THINGS BUT WHAT IT TAUGHT ME WAS TO LOOK AT EARTH AS A PLANET WITH EXTERNAL EYES NOT JUST AS OUR HOME
PenelopeBoston_2006 AND THAT IS A WONDERFUL STEPPING AWAY IN PERSPECTIVE TO TRY TO THEN THINK ABOUT THE WAY OUR PLANET BEHAVES AS A PLANET
PenelopeBoston_2006 AND WITH THE LIFE THAT'S ON IT AND ALL OF THIS SEEMS TO ME TO BE A SALIENT POINT IN HISTORY WE'RE GETTING
PenelopeBoston_2006 READY TO BEGIN TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF LEAVING OUR PLANET OF ORIGIN AND OUT INTO THE WIDER SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND
PenelopeBoston_2006 ABOUT THAT WHETHER OR NOT YOU THINK IT'S LIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL SORT OF DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE CHANCES OF LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE I THINK
PenelopeBoston_2006 AND LIFE IS A COMMON PLANETARY BASED PHENOMENON IN MY VIEW CERTAINLY IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS WE'VE SEEN INCREASING NUMBERS
PenelopeBoston_2006 PLANETS OUTSIDE OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM BEING CONFIRMED AND JUST LAST MONTH A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO A PLANET IN THE SIZE CLASS OF EARTH HAS ACTUALLY BEEN FOUND AND SO THIS IS VERY EXCITING NEWS
PenelopeBoston_2006 SO WHAT ABOUT LIFE ON MARS WELL IF SOMEBODY HAD ASKED ME ABOUT A DOZEN YEARS AGO WHAT I THOUGHT THE CHANCES OF LIFE ON MARS WOULD BE I WOULD 'VE PROBABLY SAID A COUPLE OF PERCENT
PenelopeBoston_2006 AND EVEN THAT WAS CONSIDERED OUTRAGEOUS AT THE TIME I WAS ONCE SNEERINGLY INTRODUCED BY A FORMER NASA OFFICIAL AS THE ONLY PERSON ON THE PLANET WHO STILL THOUGHT THERE WAS LIFE ON MARS
PenelopeBoston_2006 AND THE REASON THAT THEY HAVE CHANGED IS BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE NEW INFORMATION THE AMAZING PATHFINDER MISSION THAT WENT IN NINETY SEVEN
PenelopeBoston_2006 AND THE MER ROVER MISSIONS THAT ARE ON MARS AS WE SPEAK NOW AND THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY 'S MARS EXPRESS HAS TAUGHT US A NUMBER OF AMAZING THINGS
PenelopeBoston_2006 THERE IS SUB SURFACE ICE ON THAT PLANET AND SO WHERE THERE IS WATER THERE IS A VERY HIGH CHANCE OF OUR KIND OF LIFE THERE'S CLEARLY SEDIMENTARY ROCKS ALL OVER THE PLACE A ONE OF THE LANDERS IS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ANCIENT SEABED
PenelopeBoston_2006 I THINK THAT THE CHANCE OF LIFE HAVING ARISEN ON MARS SOMETIME IN ITS PAST IS MAYBE ONE IN FOUR TO MAYBE EVEN HALF AND HALF SO THIS IS A VERY BOLD STATEMENT
PenelopeBoston_2006 I THINK IT'S THERE AND I THINK WE NEED TO GO LOOK FOR IT AND I THINK IT'S UNDERGROUND SO THE GAME 'S AFOOT AND THIS IS THE GAME THAT WE PLAY IN ASTRO BIOLOGY HOW DO YOU DO YOU TRY TO GET A HANDLE ON EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE HOW DO YOU PLAN TO LOOK FOR IT
PenelopeBoston_2006 HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WHEN YOU FIND IT BECAUSE IF IT'S BIG AND OBVIOUS WE WOULD 'VE ALREADY FOUND IT IT WOULD 'VE ALREADY BITTEN US ON THE FOOT AND IT HASN 'T SO WE KNOW THAT IT'S PROBABLY QUITE CRYPTIC VERY CRITICALLY HOW DO WE PROTECT IT IF WE FIND IT AND NOT
PenelopeBoston_2006 AND ALSO EVEN PERHAPS MORE CRITICALLY BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY HOME PLANET WE HAVE HOW DO WE PROTECT US FROM IT WHILE WE STUDY
PenelopeBoston_2006 SO WHY MIGHT IT BE HARD TO FIND WELL IT'S PROBABLY MICROSCOPIC AND IT'S NEVER EASY TO STUDY MICROSCOPIC THINGS ALTHOUGH THE AMAZING TOOLS THAT WE NOW HAVE TO DO THAT ALLOW US TO STUDY THINGS IN MUCH GREATER DEPTH AT MUCH SMALLER SCALES THAN EVER BEFORE
PenelopeBoston_2006 IT'S PROBABLY HIDING BECAUSE IF YOU ARE OUT SEQUESTERING RESOURCES FROM YOUR ENVIRONMENT THAT MAKES YOU YUMMY AND OTHER THINGS MIGHT WANT TO EAT YOU OR CONSUME YOU AND SO
PenelopeBoston_2006 A GAME OF PREDATOR PREY THAT'S GOING TO BE ESSENTIALLY UNIVERSAL REALLY IN ANY KIND OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM
PenelopeBoston_2006 IT ALSO MAY BE VERY VERY DIFFERENT IN ITS FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES A ITS CHEMISTRY OR ITS SIZE WE SAY SMALL BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS IT VIRUS SIZED IS IT SMALLER THAN THAT IS IT BIGGER THAN THE BIGGEST BACTERIUM WE DON'T KNOW
PenelopeBoston_2006 AND SPEED OF ACTIVITY WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE FACE IN OUR WORK WITH SUB SURFACE ORGANISMS BECAUSE THEY GROW VERY VERY SLOWLY IF I WERE TO TAKE A SWAB OFF YOUR TEETH AND PLATE IT ON A PETRI PLATE WITHIN ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE HOURS I WOULD HAVE TO SEE GROWTH
PenelopeBoston_2006 BUT THE ORGANISMS THAT WE WORK WITH FROM THE SUB SURFACE OF EARTH VERY OFTEN IT'S MONTHS AND IN MANY CASES YEARS BEFORE WE SEE ANY GROWTH WHATSOEVER SO THEY ARE INTRINSICALLY
PenelopeBoston_2006 A SLOWER LIFE FORM BUT THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT WE ARE GUIDED BY OUR LIMITED EXPERIENCE AND UNTIL WE CAN THINK OUT OF THE BOX OF OUR CRANIUM AND WHAT WE KNOW THEN WE CAN'T RECOGNISE WHAT TO LOOK FOR OR HOW TO PLAN FOR
PenelopeBoston_2006 SO PERSPECTIVE IS EVERYTHING AND BECAUSE OF THE HISTORY THAT I'VE JUST BRIEFLY TALKED TO YOU ABOUT I HAVE LEARNED TO THINK ABOUT EARTH AS AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL PLANET AND THIS HAS BEEN INVALUABLE IN OUR APPROACH TO TRY TO STUDY THESE THINGS
PenelopeBoston_2006 MAKES ME GO FROM SEEING THIS PLANET AS HOME TO SEEING IT AS A PLANET IT'S A VERY SIMPLE TRICK AND I NEVER FAIL TO DO IT WHEN I'M SITTING IN A WINDOW SEAT WELL THIS IS WHAT WE APPLY TO OUR WORK
PenelopeBoston_2006 THIS SHOWS ONE OF THE MOST EXTREME CAVES THAT WE WORK IN THIS IS CUEVA DE VILLA LUZ IN TABASCO IN MEXICO AND THIS CAVE IS SATURATED WITH SULFURIC ACID
PenelopeBoston_2006 THERE IS TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF HYDROGEN SULFIDE COMING INTO THIS CAVE FROM VOLCANIC SOURCES AND FROM THE BREAKDOWN OF
PenelopeBoston_2006 THIRTY PARTS PER MILLION OF H TWO S WILL KILL YOU THIS IS REGULARLY SEVERAL HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION SO IT'S A VERY HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENT WITH CO AS WELL AND MANY OTHER GASES
PenelopeBoston_2006 THE EXTREMES ON EARTH ARE INTERESTING IN THEIR OWN RIGHT BUT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN THEM IS BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT REALLY THE AVERAGE CONDITIONS THAT WE MAY EXPECT ON ANOTHER PLANETS
PenelopeBoston_2006 SO THIS IS PART OF THE ABILITY THAT WE HAVE TO TRY TO STRETCH OUR IMAGINATION IN TERMS OF WHAT WE MAY FIND IN THE FUTURE
PenelopeBoston_2006 THERE'S SO MUCH LIFE IN THIS CAVE AND I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF IT WITH YOU BUT ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS OBJECTS OUT OF THIS ARE WHAT WE CALL SNOTTITES FOR OBVIOUS REASONS THIS STUFF LOOKS LIKE WHAT COMES OUT OF YOUR TWO YEAR OLD 'S NOSE WHEN HE HAS A
PenelopeBoston_2006 AND THIS IS PRODUCED BY BACTERIA WHO ARE ACTUALLY MAKING MORE SULFURIC ACID AND LIVING AT PHS RIGHT AROUND ZERO
PenelopeBoston_2006 IN SOME OF THE OTHER AMAZING CAVES THAT WE WORK IN THIS IS IN LECHUGUILLA CAVE IN NEW MEXICO NEAR CARLSBAD AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS CAVES IN THE WORLD IT'S
PenelopeBoston_2006 IN THIS CAVE GREAT AREAS ARE COVERED BY THIS REDDISH MATERIAL THAT YOU SEE HERE AND ALSO THESE ENORMOUS CRYSTALS OF SELENITE THAT YOU CAN SEE DANGLING DOWN
PenelopeBoston_2006 THIS STUFF IS PRODUCED BIOLOGICALLY THIS IS THE BREAKDOWN PRODUCT OF THE BEDROCK THAT ORGANISMS ARE BUSY MUNCHING THEIR WAY THROUGH THEY TAKE IRON AND MANGANESE
PenelopeBoston_2006 AVENUE FOR BIO REMEDIATION COMES FROM ORGANISMS LIKE THIS THESE ORGANISMS WE NOW BRING INTO THE LAB AND YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THEM GROWING ON PETRI PLATES
PenelopeBoston_2006 AND GET THEM TO REPRODUCE THE PRECISE BIOMINERALS THAT WE FIND ON THE WALLS OF THESE CAVES SO THESE ARE SIGNALS THAT THEY LEAVE IN THE ROCK RECORD
PenelopeBoston_2006 WELL EVEN IN BASALT SURFACES IN LAVA TUBE CAVES WHICH ARE A BY PRODUCT OF VOLCANIC ACTIVITY WE FIND THESE WALLS TOTALLY COVERED IN MANY CASES BY THESE BEAUTIFUL GLISTENING SILVER WALLS OR
PenelopeBoston_2006 THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THESE PARTICULAR GUYS IS THAT THEY'RE IN THE ACTINOMYCETES AND STREPTOMYCETES GROUPS OF THE BACTERIA WHICH IS WHERE WE GET MOST OF OUR ANTIBIOTICS THE SUB SURFACE OF EARTH CONTAINS A VAST BIODIVERSITY
PenelopeBoston_2006 AND THESE ORGANISMS BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY SEPARATE FROM THE SURFACE MAKE A VAST ARRAY OF NOVEL COMPOUNDS AND SO THE
PenelopeBoston_2006 LAVA TUBE CAVES I'VE JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT ORGANISMS THAT LIVE HERE ON THIS PLANET WE KNOW THAT ON MARS AND THE MOON THERE ARE TONS OF THESE STRUCTURES WE CAN SEE THEM ON THE LEFT YOU CAN SEE A LAVA TUBE FORMING AT A RECENT ERUPTION
PenelopeBoston_2006 MOUNT ETNA IN SICILY AND THIS IS THE WAY THESE TUBES FORM AND WHEN THEY HOLLOW OUT THEN THEY BECOME HABITATS FOR ORGANISMS
PenelopeBoston_2006 IN ORDER TO ACCESS THESE SUB SURFACE ENVIRONMENTS THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING THE TOOLS TO DO THIS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT EASY TO GET INTO THESE CAVES IT REQUIRES CRAWLING CLIMBING ROPE WORK
PenelopeBoston_2006 WHY WOULD WE WANT TO DO IT ROBOTICALLY WELL WE'RE GOING TO BE SENDING ROBOTIC MISSIONS TO MARS LONG IN ADVANCE OF HUMAN MISSIONS AND THEN SECONDLY GETTING BACK TO THAT EARLIER POINT THAT I MADE ABOUT THE PRECIOUSNESS OF ANY LIFE THAT WE MAY FIND
PenelopeBoston_2006 ON MARS WE DON'T WANT TO CONTAMINATE IT AND ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO STUDY SOMETHING WITHOUT CONTAMINATING IT IS TO HAVE AN INTERMEDIARY AND IN THIS CASE WE'RE
PenelopeBoston_2006 IMAGINING INTERMEDIARY ROBOTIC DEVICES THAT CAN ACTUALLY DO SOME OF THAT FRONT END WORK FOR US TO PROTECT ANY POTENTIAL LIFE THAT WE FIND
PenelopeBoston_2006 GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE PROJECTS NOW BUT WE'RE INVOLVED IN ABOUT HALF A DOZEN ROBOTIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN COLLABORATION WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT GROUPS I WANT TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE
PenelopeBoston_2006 ARRAY THAT YOU SEE ON THE TOP THESE ARE HOPPING MICROBOT SWARMS I'M WORKING ON THIS WITH THE FIELD AND SPACE ROBOTICS LABORATORY AND MY FRIEND STEVE DUBOWSKY AT MIT AND WE HAVE COME UP WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING LITTLE JUMPING BEAN LIKE
PenelopeBoston_2006 ROBOTS THAT ARE PROPELLED BY ARTIFICIAL MUSCLE WHICH IS ONE OF THE DUBOWSKY LAB 'S SPECIALTIES ARE THE EPAMISS OR ARTIFICIAL MUSCLES AND THESE ALLOW THEM TO HOP THEY BEHAVE WITH A
PenelopeBoston_2006 SWARM BEHAVIOR WHERE THEY RELATE TO EACH OTHER MODELED AFTER INSECT SWARM BEHAVIOR AND THEY COULD BE MADE VERY NUMEROUS AND SO ONE CAN SEND A THOUSAND OF THEM AS YOU CAN SEE IN THIS UPPER LEFT HAND PICTURE
PenelopeBoston_2006 A THOUSAND OF THEM COULD FIT INTO THE PAYLOAD BAY THAT WAS USED FOR ONE OF THE CURRENT MER ROVERS AND THESE LITTLE GUYS YOU COULD LOSE MANY OF THEM IF YOU SEND A THOUSAND OF THEM YOU COULD PROBABLY GET RID OF NINETY PERCENT OF THEM AND STILL HAVE A MISSION
PenelopeBoston_2006 AND SO THAT ALLOWS YOU THE FLEXIBILITY TO GO INTO VERY CHALLENGING TERRAIN AND ACTUALLY MAKE YOUR WAY WHERE YOU WANT TO
PenelopeBoston_2006 NOW TO WRAP THIS UP I WANT TO TALK FOR TWO SECONDS ABOUT CAVES AND THE HUMAN EXPANSION BEYOND EARTH AS A NATURAL OUTGROWTH OF THE WORK THAT WE DO IN CAVES IT OCCURRED TO US A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO THAT
PenelopeBoston_2006 CAVES HAVE MANY PROPERTIES THAT PEOPLE HAVE USED AND OTHER ORGANISMS HAVE USED AS HABITAT IN THE PAST AND PERHAPS IT'S TIME WE STARTED TO EXPLORE THOSE IN THE CONTEXT OF FUTURE MARS AND THE MOON EXPLORATION
PenelopeBoston_2006 SO WE HAVE JUST FINISHED A NASA INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED CONCEPTS PHASE II STUDY LOOKING AT THE IRREDUCIBLE SET OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT YOU WOULD NEED
PenelopeBoston_2006 IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY ALLOW PEOPLE TO INHABIT LAVA TUBES ON THE MOON OR MARS IT TURNS OUT TO BE A FAIRLY SIMPLE AND SMALL LIST AND WE HAVE GONE IN THE RELATIVELY
PenelopeBoston_2006 BUT I THINK IN THE FUTURE WE'LL BE USING THEM FOR HABITAT AND SCIENCE ON THESE OTHER BODIES NOW MY VIEW OF WHAT THE CURENT STATUS OF POTENTIAL LIFE ON MARS IS THAT IT'S PROBABLY BEEN ON THE PLANET MAYBE ONE IN TWO CHANCES
PenelopeBoston_2006 THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER
PenelopeBoston_2006 THERE IS LIFE ON MARS THAT IS RELATED TO LIFE ON EARTH HAS NOW BEEN VERY MUDDIED BECAUSE WE NOW KNOW FROM MARS METEORITES THAT HAVE MADE IT TO EARTH
PenelopeBoston_2006 IS THAT A SECOND GENESIS OF LIFE DID LIFE START HERE AND WAS IT TRANSPORTED THERE DID IT START THERE AND GET TRANSPORTED HERE
