DanielTammet_2011@13.82:19.03 OR MORE PRECISELY A HIGH FUNCTIONING AUTISTIC SAVANT
DanielTammet_2011@19.96:21.64 IT 'S A RARE CONDITION
DanielTammet_2011@32.68:40.56 VERY OFTEN WHEN I MEET SOMEONE AND THEY LEARN THIS ABOUT ME THERE 'S A CERTAIN KIND OF AWKWARDNESS
DanielTammet_2011@40.8:42.78 I CAN SEE IT IN THEIR EYES
DanielTammet_2011@42.94:45.33 THEY WANT TO ASK ME SOMETHING
DanielTammet_2011@45.79:50.62 AND IN THE END QUITE OFTEN THE URGE IS STRONGER THAN THEY ARE
DanielTammet_2011@50.73:52.33 AND THEY BLURT IT OUT
DanielTammet_2011@53.08:57.64 IF I GIVE YOU MY DATE OF BIRTH CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK I WAS BORN ON
DanielTammet_2011@69.39:85.57 IF I DON 'T PERFORM A KIND OF ONE MAN SAVANT SHOW FOR YOU TODAY I 'M GOING TO TALK INSTEAD ABOUT SOMETHING FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN DATES OF BIRTH OR CUBE ROOTS
DanielTammet_2011@90.79:94.68 I WANT TO TALK TO YOU BRIEFLY ABOUT PERCEPTION
DanielTammet_2011@95.91:102.63 WHEN HE WAS WRITING THE PLAYS AND THE SHORT STORIES THAT WOULD MAKE HIS NAME ANTON CHEKHOV
DanielTammet_2011@102.79:118.46 KEPT A NOTEBOOK IN WHICH HE NOTED DOWN HIS OBSERVATIONS OF THE WORLD AROUND HIM LITTLE DETAILS THAT OTHER PEOPLE SEEM TO MISS EVERY TIME I READ CHEKHOV
DanielTammet_2011@118.46:124.34 AND HIS UNIQUE VISION OF HUMAN LIFE I 'M REMINDED OF WHY I TOO
DanielTammet_2011@130.2:137.07 AND HOW DIFFERENT KINDS OF PERCEIVING CREATE DIFFERENT KINDS OF KNOWING AND UNDERSTANDING
DanielTammet_2011@140.49:146.1 HERE ARE THREE QUESTIONS DRAWN FROM MY WORK RATHER THAN TRY TO FIGURE THEM OUT
DanielTammet_2011@146.38:156.67 I 'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT THE INTUITIONS AND THE GUT INSTINCTS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD AND YOUR HEART AS YOU LOOK AT THEM
DanielTammet_2011@158.54:165.23 FOR EXAMPLE THE CALCULATION CAN YOU FEEL WHERE ON THE NUMBER LINE THE SOLUTION IS LIKELY TO FALL
DanielTammet_2011@165.75:168 OR LOOK AT THE FOREIGN WORD AND THE SOUNDS
DanielTammet_2011@168.92:173.48 CAN YOU GET A SENSE OF THE RANGE OF MEANINGS THAT IT 'S POINTING YOU TOWARDS
DanielTammet_2011@174.25:179.1 AND IN TERMS OF THE LINE OF POETRY WHY DOES THE POET USE THE WORD HARE
DanielTammet_2011@183.15:185.21 I 'M ASKING YOU TO DO THIS BECAUSE
DanielTammet_2011@185.33:192.97 I BELIEVE OUR PERSONAL PERCEPTIONS YOU SEE ARE AT THE HEART OF HOW WE ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE
DanielTammet_2011@193.59:197.53 AESTHETIC JUDGMENTS RATHER THAN ABSTRACT REASONING
DanielTammet_2011@198.19:207.77 GUIDE AND SHAPE THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE ALL COME TO KNOW WHAT WE KNOW I 'M AN EXTREME EXAMPLE OF THIS
DanielTammet_2011@228.03:243.06 HERE ARE THE NUMBERS ONE TO TWELVE AS I SEE THEM EVERY NUMBER WITH ITS OWN SHAPE AND CHARACTER ONE IS A FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT SIX IS A TINY AND VERY SAD BLACK HOLE
DanielTammet_2011@243.43:248.25 THE SKETCHES ARE IN BLACK AND WHITE HERE BUT IN MY MIND THEY HAVE COLORS
DanielTammet_2011@248.75:252.93 THREE IS GREEN FOUR IS BLUE FIVE IS YELLOW
DanielTammet_2011@256.42:264.77 I PAINT AS WELL AND HERE IS ONE OF MY PAINTINGS IT 'S A MULTIPLICATION OF TWO PRIME NUMBERS
DanielTammet_2011@266.03:267.85 THREE DIMENSIONAL SHAPES
DanielTammet_2011@268.32:271.44 AND THE SPACE THEY CREATE IN THE MIDDLE
DanielTammet_2011@279.89:283.91 YOU CAN 'T GET MUCH BIGGER THAN PI THE MATHEMATICAL CONSTANT
DanielTammet_2011@284.38:286.1 IT 'S AN INFINITE NUMBER
DanielTammet_2011@286.13:287.93 LITERALLY GOES ON FOREVER
DanielTammet_2011@288.51:293.72 IN THIS PAINTING THAT I MADE OF THE FIRST TWENTY DECIMALS OF PI
DanielTammet_2011@294.32:296.09 I TAKE THE COLORS
DanielTammet_2011@296.56:299.36 AND THE EMOTIONS AND THE TEXTURES
DanielTammet_2011@299.42:301.35 AND I PULL THEM ALL TOGETHER
DanielTammet_2011@301.51:312.25 INTO A KIND OF ROLLING NUMERICAL LANDSCAPE BUT IT 'S NOT ONLY NUMBERS THAT I SEE IN COLORS WORDS TOO FOR ME HAVE COLORS
DanielTammet_2011@312.51:315.07 AND EMOTIONS AND TEXTURES
DanielTammet_2011@315.42:319.07 AND THIS IS AN OPENING PHRASE FROM THE NOVEL LOLITA
DanielTammet_2011@319.54:321.87 AND NABOKOV WAS HIMSELF
DanielTammet_2011@344.87:346.94 THERE IS A PROCESSION OF SYLLABLES
DanielTammet_2011@348.36:357.16 WHEAT ONE PRAIRIES TWO LOST SWEDE TOWNS THREE ONE TWO THREE
DanielTammet_2011@357.31:360.8 AND THIS EFFECT IS VERY PLEASANT ON THE MIND
DanielTammet_2011@361.17:364.77 AND IT HELPS THE SENTENCE TO FEEL RIGHT
DanielTammet_2011@366.09:370.75 LET 'S GO BACK TO THE QUESTIONS I POSED YOU A MOMENT AGO
DanielTammet_2011@370.9:380.52 SIXTY FOUR MULTIPLIED BY SEVENTY FIVE IF SOME OF YOU PLAY CHESS YOU 'LL KNOW THAT SIXTY FOUR IS A SQUARE NUMBER
DanielTammet_2011@388.92:394.02 SO THAT GIVES US A FORM THAT WE CAN PICTURE THAT WE CAN PERCEIVE
DanielTammet_2011@394.65:396.29 WHAT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE
DanielTammet_2011@398.97:401.7 WE THINK OF ONE HUNDRED AS BEING LIKE A SQUARE
DanielTammet_2011@401.89:404.11 SEVENTY FIVE WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS
DanielTammet_2011@405.67:407.27 SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW
DanielTammet_2011@407.28:412.73 IS PUT THOSE TWO PICTURES TOGETHER IN OUR MIND SOMETHING LIKE THIS
DanielTammet_2011@413.57:417.84 SIXTY FOUR BECOMES SIX THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED
DanielTammet_2011@462.86:465.9 SO LET ME NARROW THE CHOICES DOWN TO TWO
DanielTammet_2011@470.71:472.45 IS IT A HAPPY WORD
DanielTammet_2011@472.85:474.4 OR A SAD WORD
DanielTammet_2011@481.29:484.75 MOST PEOPLE A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE SAY SAD
DanielTammet_2011@484.75:486.39 AND
DanielTammet_2011@487.58:489.24 IT ACTUALLY MEANS
DanielTammet_2011@501.95:508.46 IN MY THEORY LANGUAGE EVOLVES IN SUCH A WAY THAT SOUNDS MATCH CORRESPOND
DanielTammet_2011@508.76:515.12 WITH THE SUBJECTIVE WITH THE PERSONAL INTUITIVE EXPERIENCE OF THE LISTENER
DanielTammet_2011@516.79:519.8 LET 'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE THIRD QUESTION
DanielTammet_2011@521.36:524.42 IT 'S A LINE FROM A POEM BY JOHN KEATS
DanielTammet_2011@524.65:526.51 WORDS LIKE NUMBERS
DanielTammet_2011@526.98:530.3 EXPRESS FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIPS
DanielTammet_2011@530.34:535.93 BETWEEN OBJECTS AND EVENTS AND FORCES THAT CONSTITUTE OUR WORLD
DanielTammet_2011@536.09:539.29 IT STANDS TO REASON THAT WE EXISTING IN THIS WORLD
DanielTammet_2011@539.59:550.21 SHOULD IN THE COURSE OF OUR LIVES ABSORB INTUITIVELY THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND POETS LIKE OTHER ARTISTS PLAY WITH THOSE INTUITIVE UNDERSTANDINGS
DanielTammet_2011@554.62:561.43 IN THE CASE OF HARE IT 'S AN AMBIGUOUS SOUND IN ENGLISH IT CAN ALSO MEAN THE FIBERS THAT GROW FROM A HEAD AND IF WE THINK OF THAT LET ME PUT THE PICTURE UP
DanielTammet_2011@562.53:565.89 THE FIBERS REPRESENT VULNERABILITY
DanielTammet_2011@568.48:573.06 MOVEMENT OR MOTION OR EMOTION SO
DanielTammet_2011@574.25:576.09 WHAT YOU HAVE IS AN ATMOSPHERE
DanielTammet_2011@593.22:600.96 HELPS US TO PICTURE TO FEEL INTUITIVELY WHAT IT MEANS TO LIMP AND TO TREMBLE
DanielTammet_2011@602.33:612.69 SO IN THESE FEW MINUTES I HOPE I 'VE BEEN ABLE TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF MY VISION OF THINGS AND TO SHOW YOU THAT WORDS
DanielTammet_2011@627.06:630.44 I HOPE THAT I 'VE GIVEN YOU THE DESIRE TO LEARN TO SEE THE WORLD
DanielTammet_2011@630.62:633.02 WITH NEW EYES THANK YOU
