DanielTammet_2011 OR MORE PRECISELY A HIGH FUNCTIONING AUTISTIC SAVANT
DanielTammet_2011 IT 'S A RARE CONDITION
DanielTammet_2011 VERY OFTEN WHEN I MEET SOMEONE AND THEY LEARN THIS ABOUT ME THERE 'S A CERTAIN KIND OF AWKWARDNESS
DanielTammet_2011 I CAN SEE IT IN THEIR EYES
DanielTammet_2011 THEY WANT TO ASK ME SOMETHING
DanielTammet_2011 AND IN THE END QUITE OFTEN THE URGE IS STRONGER THAN THEY ARE
DanielTammet_2011 AND THEY BLURT IT OUT
DanielTammet_2011 IF I GIVE YOU MY DATE OF BIRTH CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK I WAS BORN ON
DanielTammet_2011 IF I DON 'T PERFORM A KIND OF ONE MAN SAVANT SHOW FOR YOU TODAY I 'M GOING TO TALK INSTEAD ABOUT SOMETHING FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN DATES OF BIRTH OR CUBE ROOTS
DanielTammet_2011 I WANT TO TALK TO YOU BRIEFLY ABOUT PERCEPTION
DanielTammet_2011 WHEN HE WAS WRITING THE PLAYS AND THE SHORT STORIES THAT WOULD MAKE HIS NAME ANTON CHEKHOV
DanielTammet_2011 KEPT A NOTEBOOK IN WHICH HE NOTED DOWN HIS OBSERVATIONS OF THE WORLD AROUND HIM LITTLE DETAILS THAT OTHER PEOPLE SEEM TO MISS EVERY TIME I READ CHEKHOV
DanielTammet_2011 AND HIS UNIQUE VISION OF HUMAN LIFE I 'M REMINDED OF WHY I TOO
DanielTammet_2011 AND HOW DIFFERENT KINDS OF PERCEIVING CREATE DIFFERENT KINDS OF KNOWING AND UNDERSTANDING
DanielTammet_2011 HERE ARE THREE QUESTIONS DRAWN FROM MY WORK RATHER THAN TRY TO FIGURE THEM OUT
DanielTammet_2011 I 'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT THE INTUITIONS AND THE GUT INSTINCTS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD AND YOUR HEART AS YOU LOOK AT THEM
DanielTammet_2011 FOR EXAMPLE THE CALCULATION CAN YOU FEEL WHERE ON THE NUMBER LINE THE SOLUTION IS LIKELY TO FALL
DanielTammet_2011 OR LOOK AT THE FOREIGN WORD AND THE SOUNDS
DanielTammet_2011 CAN YOU GET A SENSE OF THE RANGE OF MEANINGS THAT IT 'S POINTING YOU TOWARDS
DanielTammet_2011 AND IN TERMS OF THE LINE OF POETRY WHY DOES THE POET USE THE WORD HARE
DanielTammet_2011 I 'M ASKING YOU TO DO THIS BECAUSE
DanielTammet_2011 I BELIEVE OUR PERSONAL PERCEPTIONS YOU SEE ARE AT THE HEART OF HOW WE ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE
DanielTammet_2011 AESTHETIC JUDGMENTS RATHER THAN ABSTRACT REASONING
DanielTammet_2011 GUIDE AND SHAPE THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE ALL COME TO KNOW WHAT WE KNOW I 'M AN EXTREME EXAMPLE OF THIS
DanielTammet_2011 HERE ARE THE NUMBERS ONE TO TWELVE AS I SEE THEM EVERY NUMBER WITH ITS OWN SHAPE AND CHARACTER ONE IS A FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT SIX IS A TINY AND VERY SAD BLACK HOLE
DanielTammet_2011 THE SKETCHES ARE IN BLACK AND WHITE HERE BUT IN MY MIND THEY HAVE COLORS
DanielTammet_2011 THREE IS GREEN FOUR IS BLUE FIVE IS YELLOW
DanielTammet_2011 I PAINT AS WELL AND HERE IS ONE OF MY PAINTINGS IT 'S A MULTIPLICATION OF TWO PRIME NUMBERS
DanielTammet_2011 THREE DIMENSIONAL SHAPES
DanielTammet_2011 AND THE SPACE THEY CREATE IN THE MIDDLE
DanielTammet_2011 YOU CAN 'T GET MUCH BIGGER THAN PI THE MATHEMATICAL CONSTANT
DanielTammet_2011 IT 'S AN INFINITE NUMBER
DanielTammet_2011 LITERALLY GOES ON FOREVER
DanielTammet_2011 IN THIS PAINTING THAT I MADE OF THE FIRST TWENTY DECIMALS OF PI
DanielTammet_2011 I TAKE THE COLORS
DanielTammet_2011 AND THE EMOTIONS AND THE TEXTURES
DanielTammet_2011 AND I PULL THEM ALL TOGETHER
DanielTammet_2011 INTO A KIND OF ROLLING NUMERICAL LANDSCAPE BUT IT 'S NOT ONLY NUMBERS THAT I SEE IN COLORS WORDS TOO FOR ME HAVE COLORS
DanielTammet_2011 AND EMOTIONS AND TEXTURES
DanielTammet_2011 AND THIS IS AN OPENING PHRASE FROM THE NOVEL LOLITA
DanielTammet_2011 AND NABOKOV WAS HIMSELF
DanielTammet_2011 THERE IS A PROCESSION OF SYLLABLES
DanielTammet_2011 WHEAT ONE PRAIRIES TWO LOST SWEDE TOWNS THREE ONE TWO THREE
DanielTammet_2011 AND THIS EFFECT IS VERY PLEASANT ON THE MIND
DanielTammet_2011 AND IT HELPS THE SENTENCE TO FEEL RIGHT
DanielTammet_2011 LET 'S GO BACK TO THE QUESTIONS I POSED YOU A MOMENT AGO
DanielTammet_2011 SIXTY FOUR MULTIPLIED BY SEVENTY FIVE IF SOME OF YOU PLAY CHESS YOU 'LL KNOW THAT SIXTY FOUR IS A SQUARE NUMBER
DanielTammet_2011 SO THAT GIVES US A FORM THAT WE CAN PICTURE THAT WE CAN PERCEIVE
DanielTammet_2011 WHAT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE
DanielTammet_2011 WE THINK OF ONE HUNDRED AS BEING LIKE A SQUARE
DanielTammet_2011 SEVENTY FIVE WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS
DanielTammet_2011 SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW
DanielTammet_2011 IS PUT THOSE TWO PICTURES TOGETHER IN OUR MIND SOMETHING LIKE THIS
DanielTammet_2011 SIXTY FOUR BECOMES SIX THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED
DanielTammet_2011 SO LET ME NARROW THE CHOICES DOWN TO TWO
DanielTammet_2011 IS IT A HAPPY WORD
DanielTammet_2011 OR A SAD WORD
DanielTammet_2011 MOST PEOPLE A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE SAY SAD
DanielTammet_2011 AND
DanielTammet_2011 IT ACTUALLY MEANS
DanielTammet_2011 IN MY THEORY LANGUAGE EVOLVES IN SUCH A WAY THAT SOUNDS MATCH CORRESPOND
DanielTammet_2011 WITH THE SUBJECTIVE WITH THE PERSONAL INTUITIVE EXPERIENCE OF THE LISTENER
DanielTammet_2011 LET 'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE THIRD QUESTION
DanielTammet_2011 IT 'S A LINE FROM A POEM BY JOHN KEATS
DanielTammet_2011 WORDS LIKE NUMBERS
DanielTammet_2011 EXPRESS FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIPS
DanielTammet_2011 BETWEEN OBJECTS AND EVENTS AND FORCES THAT CONSTITUTE OUR WORLD
DanielTammet_2011 IT STANDS TO REASON THAT WE EXISTING IN THIS WORLD
DanielTammet_2011 SHOULD IN THE COURSE OF OUR LIVES ABSORB INTUITIVELY THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND POETS LIKE OTHER ARTISTS PLAY WITH THOSE INTUITIVE UNDERSTANDINGS
DanielTammet_2011 IN THE CASE OF HARE IT 'S AN AMBIGUOUS SOUND IN ENGLISH IT CAN ALSO MEAN THE FIBERS THAT GROW FROM A HEAD AND IF WE THINK OF THAT LET ME PUT THE PICTURE UP
DanielTammet_2011 THE FIBERS REPRESENT VULNERABILITY
DanielTammet_2011 MOVEMENT OR MOTION OR EMOTION SO
DanielTammet_2011 WHAT YOU HAVE IS AN ATMOSPHERE
DanielTammet_2011 HELPS US TO PICTURE TO FEEL INTUITIVELY WHAT IT MEANS TO LIMP AND TO TREMBLE
DanielTammet_2011 SO IN THESE FEW MINUTES I HOPE I 'VE BEEN ABLE TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF MY VISION OF THINGS AND TO SHOW YOU THAT WORDS
DanielTammet_2011 I HOPE THAT I 'VE GIVEN YOU THE DESIRE TO LEARN TO SEE THE WORLD
DanielTammet_2011 WITH NEW EYES THANK YOU
