CameronHerold_2009X@17.19:28.95 THAT I'M THE DUMBEST GUY IN THE ROOM BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET THROUGH SCHOOL I STRUGGLED WITH SCHOOL BUT WHAT I KNEW AT A VERY EARLY AGE WAS THAT I LOVED MONEY AND I LOVED BUSINESS AND I LOVED THIS ENTREPRENEURIAL THING AND I WAS RAISED TO BE AN ENTREPRENEUR
CameronHerold_2009X@29.27:39.60 AND WHAT I'VE BEEN REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT EVER SINCE AND I'VE NEVER SPOKEN ABOUT THIS EVER UNTIL NOW SO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME ANYONE 'S EVER HEARD IT EXCEPT MY WIFE THREE DAYS AGO BECAUSE SHE SAID WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT AND I TOLD
CameronHerold_2009X@40.48:47.33 IS THAT I THINK WE MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIND THESE KIDS WHO HAVE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL TRAITS AND TO GROOM THEM
CameronHerold_2009X@47.92:56.04 SHOW THEM THAT BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR IS ACTUALLY A COOL THING IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS A BAD THING AND IS VILIFIED WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS IN A LOT OF SOCIETY
CameronHerold_2009X@56.94:63.56 KIDS WHEN WE GROW UP HAVE DREAMS AND WE HAVE PASSIONS AND WE HAVE VISIONS AND SOMEHOW WE GET THOSE THINGS CRUSHED
CameronHerold_2009X@73.72:81.12 TWO YEARS AGO I WAS THE HIGHEST RATED LECTURER AT MIT 'S ENTREPRENEURIAL MASTER 'S PROGRAM AND IT WAS A SPEAKING EVENT IN FRONT OF GROUPS OF ENTREPRENEURS FROM AROUND THE WORLD

CameronHerold_2009X@163.66:172.12 GIFTS TO GO ON IN SCIENCE WHAT IF WE SAW THE ONES WHO HAD ENTREPRENEURIAL TRAITS AND TAUGHT THEM TO BE ENTREPRENEURS WE COULD HAVE ALL THESE KIDS SPREADING BUSINESSES INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR GOVERNMENT HANDOUTS
CameronHerold_2009X@172.76:177.50 WHAT WE DO IS WE SIT AND TEACH OUR KIDS ALL THE THINGS THEY SHOULDN 'T DO DON'T HIT DON'T BITE DON'T SWEAR
CameronHerold_2009X@177.96:187.65 RIGHT NOW WE TEACH OUR KIDS TO GO AFTER REALLY GOOD JOBS YOU KNOW AND THE SCHOOL SYSTEM TEACHES THEM TO GO AFTER THINGS LIKE BEING A DOCTOR AND BEING A LAWYER AND BEING AN ACCOUNTANT AND A DENTIST AND A TEACHER AND A PILOT
CameronHerold_2009X@188.09:198.63 AND THE MEDIA SAYS THAT IT'S REALLY COOL IF WE COULD GO OUT AND BE A MODEL OR A SINGER OR A SPORTS HERO LIKE SIDNEY CROSBY OUR MBA PROGRAMS DO NOT TEACH KIDS TO BE ENTREPRENEURS
