EricSanderson_2009G@17.19:28.11 OF THINGS UNSEEN CITIES PAST AND FUTURE IN OXFORD PERHAPS WE CAN USE LEWIS CARROLL AND LOOK IN THE LOOKING GLASS THAT IS NEW YORK CITY
EricSanderson_2009G@28.47:37.55 TO TRY AND SEE OUR TRUE SELVES OR PERHAPS PASS THROUGH TO ANOTHER WORLD OR IN THE WORDS OF F SCOTT FITZGERALD
EricSanderson_2009G@38.12:50.28 AS THE MOON ROSE HIGHER THE INESSENTIAL HOUSES BEGIN TO MELT AWAY UNTIL GRADUALLY I BECAME AWARE OF THE OLD ISLAND HERE THAT ONCE FLOWERED FOR DUTCH SAILOR 'S EYES A FRESH GREEN BREAST OF THE NEW WORLD
EricSanderson_2009G@50.81:57.95 MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR TEN YEARS TO REDISCOVER THIS LOST WORLD IN A PROJECT WE CALL THE MANNAHATTA PROJECT
EricSanderson_2009G@66.25:80.01 LIKE TO TELL YOU THE STORY IN THREE ACTS AND IF I HAVE TIME STILL AN EPILOGUE SO ACT I A MAP FOUND SO I DIDN'T GROW UP IN NEW YORK I GREW UP OUT WEST IN THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS LIKE YOU SEE HERE IN THE RED ROCK CANYON
EricSanderson_2009G@103.93:114.25 WHICH WORKS TO SAVE WILDLIFE AND WILD PLACES ALL OVER THE WORLD AND OVER THE LAST DECADE I TRAVELED TO OVER FORTY COUNTRIES TO SEE JAGUARS AND BEARS AND ELEPHANTS AND TIGERS AND RHINOS
EricSanderson_2009G@125.75:133.64 AND I'D WONDER HOW DOES THIS LANDSCAPE WORK TO MAKE HABITAT FOR PLANTS AND ANIMALS HOW DOES IT WORK TO MAKE HABITAT FOR ANIMALS LIKE ME
EricSanderson_2009G@134.07:141.63 GO TO TIMES SQUARE AND I'D LOOK AT THE AMAZING LADIES ON THE WALL AND WONDER WHY NOBODY IS LOOKING AT THE HISTORICAL FIGURES JUST BEHIND THEM
EricSanderson_2009G@151.15:158.39 I STARTED READING ABOUT THE HISTORY AND THE GEOGRAPHY IN NEW YORK CITY I READ THAT NEW YORK CITY WAS THE FIRST MEGA CITY A CITY OF TEN MILLION PEOPLE OR MORE
EricSanderson_2009G@169.08:179.94 IT WAS ONCE A BEACH AND THIS PAINTING HAS JOHN JAMES AUDUBON THE PAINTER SITTING ON THE ROCK AND IT'S LOOKING UP ON THE WOODED HEIGHTS OF WASHINGTON HEIGHTS TO JEFFREY 'S HOOK WHERE THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE GOES ACROSS TODAY
EricSanderson_2009G@180.51:187.88 OR THIS PAINTING FROM THE SEVENTEEN FORTIES FROM GREENWICH VILLAGE THOSE ARE TWO STUDENTS AT KING 'S COLLEGE LATER COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SITTING ON A HILL
EricSanderson_2009G@201.88:207.25 AND IT'S THIS MAP YOU SEE HERE IT'S HELD IN A GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWS ME TO ZOOM IN
EricSanderson_2009G@216.84:225.28 IT'S A REMARKABLE MAP IT'S IN THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES HERE IN KEW AND IT'S TEN FEET LONG AND THREE AND A HALF FEET WIDE AND IF I ZOOM IN TO LOWER MANHATTAN
EricSanderson_2009G@225.66:236.88 YOU CAN SEE THE EXTENT OF NEW YORK CITY AS IT WAS RIGHT AT THE END OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION HERE 'S BOWLING GREEN AND HERE 'S BROADWAY AND THIS IS CITY HALL PARK SO THE CITY BASICALLY EXTENDED TO CITY HALL PARK
EricSanderson_2009G@258.07:263.77 THIS MAP WAS MADE FOR MILITARY REASONS THEY'RE MAPPING THE ROADS THE BUILDINGS THESE FORTIFICATIONS THAT THEY BUILT
EricSanderson_2009G@273.07:280.77 AND MINETTA WATER WHICH USED TO RUN ITS WAY THROUGH GREENWICH VILLAGE OR THE SWAMP AT GRAMERCY PARK RIGHT HERE
EricSanderson_2009G@281.76:288.39 OR MURRAY HILL AND THIS IS THE MURRAY 'S HOUSE ON MURRAY HILL TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO HERE IS TIMES SQUARE
EricSanderson_2009G@289.14:300.75 THE TWO STREAMS THAT CAME TOGETHER TO MAKE A WETLAND IN TIMES SQUARE AS IT WAS AT THE END OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION SO I SAW THIS REMARKABLE MAP IN A BOOK AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF YOU KNOW
EricSanderson_2009G@300.97:308.62 IF I COULD GEOREFERENCE THIS MAP IF I COULD PLACE THIS MAP IN THE GRID OF THE CITY TODAY I COULD FIND THESE LOST FEATURES OF THE CITY
EricSanderson_2009G@309.30:322.12 IN THE BLOCK BY BLOCK GEOGRAPHY THAT PEOPLE KNOW THE GEOGRAPHY OF WHERE PEOPLE GO TO WORK AND WHERE THEY GO TO LIVE AND WHERE THEY LIKE TO EAT SO AFTER SOME WORK WE WERE ABLE TO GEOREFERENCE IT WHICH ALLOWS US TO PUT THE MODERN STREETS ON THE CITY
EricSanderson_2009G@322.53:326.10 AND THE BUILDINGS AND THE OPEN SPACES
EricSanderson_2009G@332.99:335.13 WE CAN DIGITIZE THE COLLECT POND
EricSanderson_2009G@341.96:346.35 SO THIS IS FUN FOR FINDING WHERE THINGS ARE RELATIVE TO THE OLD TOPOGRAPHY
EricSanderson_2009G@358.89:365.45 PULL OFF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY FEATURES WE COULD DRIVE IT BACK IN TIME WE COULD DRIVE IT BACK TO ITS ECOLOGICAL FUNDAMENTALS
EricSanderson_2009G@366.28:375.79 TO THE HILLS TO THE STREAMS TO THE BASIC HYDROLOGY AND SHORELINE TO THE BEACHES THE BASIC ASPECTS THAT MAKE THE ECOLOGICAL LANDSCAPE
EricSanderson_2009G@376.26:384.39 IF WE ADDED MAPS LIKE THE GEOLOGY THE BEDROCK GEOLOGY AND THE SURFACE GEOLOGY WHAT THE GLACIERS LEAVE IF WE MAKE THE SOIL MAP
EricSanderson_2009G@396.45:398.30 THEN WE CAN CALCULATE THE SLOPES
EricSanderson_2009G@399.39:405.64 THE ASPECT WE CAN CALCULATE THE WINTER WIND EXPOSURE SO WHICH WAY THE WINTER WINDS BLOW ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE
EricSanderson_2009G@430.47:432.48 WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS A LENAPE SETTLEMENT
EricSanderson_2009G@433.11:434.49 DOWN HERE BY THE COLLECT POND
EricSanderson_2009G@455.06:462.83 THEY HAVE BECOME SUCCESSIONAL SHRUB LANDS AND THESE THEN MIX IN TO A MAP OF ALL THE ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES AND IT TURNS OUT THAT MANHATTAN
EricSanderson_2009G@463.17:476.89 HAD FIFTY FIVE DIFFERENT ECOSYSTEM TYPES YOU CAN THINK OF THESE AS NEIGHBORHOODS AS DISTINCTIVE AS TRIBECA AND THE UPPER EAST SIDE AND INWOOD THAT THESE ARE THE FOREST AND THE WETLANDS AND THE MARINE COMMUNITIES THE BEACHES
EricSanderson_2009G@487.30:493.15 WAS REALLY AN EXTRAORDINARY LANDSCAPE THAT WAS CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING AN EXTRAORDINARY BIODIVERSITY
EricSanderson_2009G@494.01:501.56 SO ACT TWO A HOME RECONSTRUCTED SO WE STUDIED THE FISH AND THE FROGS AND THE BIRDS AND THE BEES
EricSanderson_2009G@502.14:515.41 THE EIGHTY FIVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF FISH THAT WERE ON MANHATTAN THE HEATH HENS THE SPECIES THAT AREN'T THERE ANYMORE THE BEAVERS ON ALL THE STREAMS THE BLACK BEARS AND THE NATIVE AMERICANS TO STUDY HOW THEY USED AND THOUGHT ABOUT THEIR LANDSCAPE
EricSanderson_2009G@516.45:524.30 WANTED TO TRY AND MAP THESE AND TO DO THAT WHAT WE DID WAS WE MAPPED THEIR HABITAT NEEDS WHERE DO THEY GET THEIR FOOD WHERE DO THEY GET THEIR WATER
EricSanderson_2009G@524.70:534.60 THEY GET THEIR SHELTER WHERE DO THEY GET THEIR REPRODUCTIVE RESOURCES TO AN ECOLOGIST THE INTERSECTION OF THESE IS HABITAT BUT TO MOST PEOPLE THE INTERSECTION OF THESE IS THEIR HOME
EricSanderson_2009G@536.55:547.92 SO WE WOULD READ IN FIELD GUIDES THE STANDARD FIELD GUIDES THAT MAYBE YOU HAVE ON YOUR SHELVES YOU KNOW WHAT BEAVERS NEED IS A SLOWLY MEANDERING STREAM WITH ASPEN TREES AND ALDERS AND WILLOWS NEAR THE WATER THAT'S THE BEST THING FOR A BEAVER
EricSanderson_2009G@561.94:570.75 OR THE BOBCAT NEEDING RABBITS AND BEAVERS AND DEN SITES AND RAPIDLY WE STARTED TO REALIZE THAT BEAVERS CAN BE SOMETHING THAT A BOBCAT NEEDS
EricSanderson_2009G@571.33:580.38 BUT A BEAVER ALSO NEEDS THINGS AND THAT HAVING IT ON EITHER SIDE MEANS THAT WE CAN LINK IT TOGETHER THAT WE CAN CREATE THE NETWORK OF THE HABITAT RELATIONSHIPS FOR THESE SPECIES
EricSanderson_2009G@580.96:588.99 MOREOVER WE REALIZED THAT YOU CAN START OUT AS BEING A BEAVER SPECIALIST BUT YOU CAN LOOK UP WHAT AN ASPEN NEEDS AN ASPEN NEEDS FIRE AND DRY SOILS
EricSanderson_2009G@589.77:595.76 YOU CAN LOOK AT WHAT A WET MEADOW NEEDS AND IT NEED BEAVERS TO CREATE THE WETLANDS AND MAYBE SOME OTHER THINGS
EricSanderson_2009G@596.52:605.76 ALSO TALK ABOUT SUNNY PLACES SO WHAT DOES A SUNNY PLACE NEED NOT HABITAT PER SE BUT WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE OR FIRE OR DRY SOILS
EricSanderson_2009G@628.31:639.63 WE CALL THIS THE MUIR WEB AND IF YOU ZOOM IN ON IT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS EACH POINT IS A DIFFERENT SPECIES OR A DIFFERENT STREAM OR A DIFFERENT SOIL TYPE AND THOSE LITTLE GRAY LINES ARE THE CONNECTIONS THAT CONNECT THEM TOGETHER
EricSanderson_2009G@640.13:647.83 THE CONNECTIONS THAT ACTUALLY MAKE NATURE RESILIENT AND THE STRUCTURE OF THIS IS WHAT MAKES NATURE WORK SEEN WITH ALL ITS PARTS
EricSanderson_2009G@648.93:660.83 WE CALL THESE MUIR WEBS AFTER THE SCOTTISH AMERICAN NATURALIST JOHN MUIR WHO SAID WHEN WE TRY TO PICK OUT ANYTHING BY ITSELF WE FIND THAT IT'S BOUND FAST BY A THOUSAND INVISIBLE CORDS THAT CAN NOT BE BROKEN TO EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE
EricSanderson_2009G@661.97:670.21 SO THEN WE TOOK THE MUIR WEBS AND WE TOOK THEM BACK TO THE MAPS SO IF WE WANTED TO GO BETWEEN EIGHTY FIFTH AND EIGHTY SIXTH AND LEX AND THREE RD MAYBE THERE WAS A STREAM IN THAT BLOCK
EricSanderson_2009G@670.78:677.90 BE THE KIND OF TREES THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THERE AND THE FLOWERS AND THE LICHENS AND THE MOSSES THE BUTTERFLIES
EricSanderson_2009G@678.31:688.37 THE FISH IN THE STREAM THE BIRDS IN THE TREES MAYBE A TIMBER RATTLESNAKE LIVED THERE AND PERHAPS A BLACK BEAR WALKED BY AND MAYBE NATIVE AMERICANS WERE THERE AND THEN WE TOOK THIS DATA
EricSanderson_2009G@697.24:705.18 AND REVEAL A LANDSCAPE HERE IN ACT THREE WE USED THE TOOLS THEY USE IN HOLLYWOOD TO MAKE THESE FANTASTIC LANDSCAPES THAT WE ALL SEE IN THE MOVIES
EricSanderson_2009G@736.82:750.50 FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO THIS IS THE VIEW FROM THE EAST RIVER LOOKING UP MURRAY HILL AT WHERE THE UNITED NATIONS IS TODAY THIS IS THE VIEW LOOKING DOWN THE HUDSON RIVER WITH MANHATTAN ON THE LEFT AND NEW JERSEY OUT ON THE RIGHT LOOKING OUT TOWARD THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
EricSanderson_2009G@751.79:764.05 THIS IS THE VIEW OVER TIMES SQUARE WITH THE BEAVER POND THERE LOOKING OUT TOWARD THE EAST SO WE CAN SEE THE COLLECT POND AND LISPENARD MARSHES BACK BEHIND WE CAN SEE THE FIELDS THAT THE NATIVE AMERICANS MADE
EricSanderson_2009G@764.74:778.05 AND WE CAN SEE THIS IN THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE CITY TODAY SO WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING LAW AND ORDER AND THE LAWYERS WALK UP THE STEPS THEY COULD HAVE WALKED BACK DOWN THOSE STEPS OF THE NEW YORK COURT HOUSE RIGHT INTO THE COLLECT POND FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO
EricSanderson_2009G@798.84:809.29 SUCH POWER IN BRINGING SCIENCE AND VISUALIZATION TOGETHER THAT WE CAN CREATE IMAGES LIKE THIS PERHAPS LOOKING ON EITHER SIDE OF A LOOKING GLASS AND EVEN THOUGH I'VE ONLY HAD A BRIEF TIME TO SPEAK I HOPE YOU APPRECIATE THAT
EricSanderson_2009G@819.28:827.16 THAT IS WHAT WE NEED IN OUR MODERN WORLD BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE YOU THINK THAT I DON'T LIKE THE PLACE ON THE RIGHT WHICH I QUITE DO I'VE COME TO LOVE THE CITY
EricSanderson_2009G@827.45:837.82 AND ITS KIND OF DIVERSITY AND ITS RESILIENCE AND ITS DEPENDENCE ON DENSITY AND HOW WE'RE CONNECTED TOGETHER IN FACT THAT I SEE THEM AS REFLECTIONS OF EACH OTHER
EricSanderson_2009G@838.26:850.28 MUCH AS LEWIS CARROLL DID IN THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS WE CAN COMPARE THESE TWO AND HOLD THEM IN OUR MINDS AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY REALLY ARE THE SAME PLACE THAT THERE IS NO WAY THAT CITIES CAN ESCAPE FROM NATURE
EricSanderson_2009G@860.19:870.47 WE'RE REALIZING IS THAT CITIES ARE HABITATS FOR PEOPLE AND NEED TO SUPPLY WHAT PEOPLE NEED A SENSE OF HOME FOOD WATER SHELTER REPRODUCTIVE RESOURCES
EricSanderson_2009G@870.92:884.42 AND A SENSE OF MEANING THIS IS THE PARTICULAR ADDITIONAL HABITAT REQUIREMENT OF HUMANITY AND SO MANY OF THE TALKS HERE AT TED ARE ABOUT MEANING ABOUT BRINGING MEANING TO OUR LIVES IN ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT WAYS THROUGH TECHNOLOGY THROUGH ART THROUGH SCIENCE
EricSanderson_2009G@884.71:894.99 SO MUCH SO THAT I THINK WE FOCUS SO MUCH ON THAT SIDE OF OUR LIVES THAT WE HAVEN'T GIVEN ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THE FOOD AND THE WATER AND THE SHELTER AND WHAT WE NEED TO RAISE THE KIDS
EricSanderson_2009G@895.99:908.95 SO HOW CAN WE ENVISION THE CITY OF THE FUTURE WELL WHAT IF WE GO TO MADISON SQUARE PARK AND WE IMAGINE IT WITHOUT ALL THE CARS AND BICYCLES INSTEAD AND LARGE FORESTS AND STREAMS INSTEAD OF SEWERS AND STORM DRAINS
EricSanderson_2009G@910.41:919.54 WHAT IF WE IMAGINED THE UPPER EAST SIDE WITH GREEN ROOFS AND STREAMS WINDING THROUGH THE CITY AND WINDMILLS SUPPLYING THE POWER WE NEED
EricSanderson_2009G@920.02:928.11 IF WE IMAGINE THE NEW YORK CITY METROPOLITAN AREA CURRENTLY HOME TO TWELVE MILLION PEOPLE BUT TWELVE MILLION PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE PERHAPS LIVING AT THE DENSITY OF MANHATTAN
EricSanderson_2009G@937.88:944.55 THIS IS THE KIND OF FUTURE I THINK WE NEED IS A FUTURE THAT HAS THE SAME DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE AND
