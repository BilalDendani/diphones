HansRosling_2009 WHAT WE ARE SHOWING HERE IS ON THIS AXIS HERE I'M SHOWING PERCENT OF INFECTED ADULTS AND
HansRosling_2009 ON THIS AXIS I'M SHOWING DOLLARS PER PERSON IN INCOME
HansRosling_2009 AND THE SIZE OF THESE BUBBLES THE SIZE OF THE BUBBLES HERE THAT SHOWS
HansRosling_2009 A SIZABLE BUBBLE THERE WERE QUITE MANY PEOPLE INFECTED IN THE UNITED STATES AND UP THERE YOU SEE UGANDA THEY HAD ALMOST FIVE PERCENT INFECTED
HansRosling_2009 AND QUITE A BIG BUBBLE IN SPITE OF BEING A SMALL COUNTRY THEN AND THEY WERE PROBABLY THE MOST INFECTED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD NOW WHAT
HansRosling_2009 NOW YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE GRAPH
HansRosling_2009 AND NOW IN THE NEXT SIXTY SECONDS WE WILL PLAY THE HIV EPIDEMIC IN THE WORLD BUT FIRST I HAVE A NEW INVENTION HERE
HansRosling_2009 I HAVE SOLIDIFIED THE BEAM OF THE
HansRosling_2009 FIRST WE HAVE THE
HansRosling_2009 RISE IN UGANDA AND ZIMBABWE THEY WENT UPWARDS LIKE THIS IN ASIA THE FIRST COUNTRY TO BE HEAVILY INFECTED WAS THAILAND
HansRosling_2009 THEY REACHED ONE TO TWO PERCENT THEN UGANDA STARTED TO TURN BACK WHEREAS ZIMBABWE SKYROCKETED AND SOME YEARS LATER SOUTH AFRICA HAD A TERRIBLE RISE OF HIV FREQUENCY
HansRosling_2009 LOOK INDIA GOT MANY INFECTED BUT HAD A LOW LEVEL AND ALMOST THE SAME HAPPENS HERE SEE UGANDA COMING DOWN ZIMBABWE COMING DOWN RUSSIA WENT TO ONE PERCENT
HansRosling_2009 IN THE LAST TWO TO THREE YEARS WE HAVE REACHED A STEADY STATE OF HIV EPIDEMIC IN THE WORLD
HansRosling_2009 TWENTY FIVE YEARS IT TOOK BUT STEADY STATE DOESN'T MEAN THAT THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER IT'S JUST THAT THEY HAVE STOPPED GETTING WORSE AND IT HAS
HansRosling_2009 NOW LET ME MAKE A FAST REPLAY OF BOTSWANA BOTSWANA UPPER MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT GOOD ECONOMY AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED
HansRosling_2009 THEY STARTED LOW THEY SKYROCKETED THEY PEAKED UP THERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE
HansRosling_2009 AND NOW THEY ARE DOWN BUT THEY ARE FALLING ONLY SLOWLY BECAUSE IN BOTSWANA WITH GOOD ECONOMY AND GOVERNANCE THEY CAN MANAGE TO TREAT PEOPLE
HansRosling_2009 AND IF PEOPLE WHO ARE INFECTED ARE TREATED THEY DON'T DIE OF AIDS THESE PERCENTAGES WON 'T COME DOWN BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN SURVIVE TEN TO TWENTY YEARS
HansRosling_2009 SO THERE'S SOME PROBLEM WITH THESE METRICS NOW BUT THE POORER COUNTRIES IN AFRICA THE LOW INCOME COUNTRIES DOWN HERE THERE
HansRosling_2009 THE RATES FALL FASTER OF THE PERCENTAGE INFECTED BECAUSE PEOPLE STILL DIE IN SPITE OF PEPFAR THE GENEROUS PEPFAR
HansRosling_2009 ALL PEOPLE ARE NOT REACHED BY TREATMENT AND OF THOSE WHO ARE REACHED BY TREATMENT IN THE POOR COUNTRIES ONLY SIXTY PERCENT ARE LEFT ON TREATMENT
HansRosling_2009 ONLY BY STOPPING THE TRANSMISSION THAT THE WORLD WILL BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH IT DOCTORUGS IS TOO COSTLY HAD WE HAD THE VACCINE OR WHEN WE WILL GET THE VACCINE
HansRosling_2009 SOMETHING MORE EFFECTIVE BUT THE DRUGS ARE VERY COSTLY FOR THE POOR NOT THE DRUG IN ITSELF BUT THE TREATMENT AND THE CARE WHICH IS NEEDED AROUND IT SO
HansRosling_2009 WHEN WE LOOK AT
HansRosling_2009 ONE THING COMES OUT VERY CLEARLY YOU SEE THE BLUE BUBBLES AND PEOPLE SAY HIV IS VERY HIGH IN AFRICA I WOULD SAY HIV IS VERY DIFFERENT IN AFRICA
HansRosling_2009 THE HIGHEST HIV RATE IN THE WORLD IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES AND YET YOU'LL FIND
HansRosling_2009 DOWN HERE THE SAME RATE AS UNITED STATES AND YOU'LL FIND MADAGASCAR AND YOU'LL FIND A LOT OF AFRICAN COUNTRIES ABOUT AS LOW AS THE REST OF THE WORLD
HansRosling_2009 THIS TERRIBLE SIMPLIFICATION THAT THERE'S ONE
HansRosling_2009 AFRICA AND THINGS GO ON IN ONE WAY IN AFRICA WE HAVE TO STOP THAT IT'S NOT RESPECTFUL AND IT'S NOT VERY CLEVER TO THINK THAT
HansRosling_2009 I HAD THE FORTUNE TO LIVE AND WORK FOR A TIME IN THE UNITED STATES I FOUND OUT THAT SALT LAKE CITY AND SAN FRANCISCO WERE DIFFERENT
HansRosling_2009 AND SO IT IS IN AFRICA IT'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCE SO WHY IS IT SO HIGH IS IT WAR NO IT'S NOT LOOK HERE WAR TORN CONGO IS DOWN THERE TWO THREE FOUR PERCENT
HansRosling_2009 AND THIS IS PEACEFUL ZAMBIA NEIGHBORING COUNTRY FIFTEEN PERCENT AND THERE'S GOOD STUDIES OF THE REFUGEES COMING OUT OF CONGO THEY HAVE TWO THREE PERCENT INFECTED AND PEACEFUL ZAMBIA MUCH HIGHER
HansRosling_2009 NOW STUDIES CLEARLY SHOWING THAT THE WARS ARE TERRIBLE THAT RAPES ARE TERRIBLE BUT THIS IS NOT THE DRIVING FORCE FOR THE HIGH LEVELS IN AFRICA
HansRosling_2009 SO
HansRosling_2009 IF YOU LOOK AT THE MACRO LEVEL IT SEEMS MORE MONEY MORE HIV
HansRosling_2009 SO THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE WITHIN TANZANIA AND I CAN'T AVOID SHOWING KENYA LOOK HERE AT KENYA I'VE SPLIT KENYA IN ITS PROVINCES HERE IT GOES
HansRosling_2009 SEE THE DIFFERENCE WITHIN ONE AFRICAN COUNTRY IT GOES FROM VERY LOW LEVEL TO VERY HIGH LEVEL AND MOST OF THE PROVINCES IN KENYA IS QUITE MODEST
HansRosling_2009 SO WHAT IS IT
HansRosling_2009 THE HIGHLY INFECTED ARE FOUR PERCENT OF ALL POPULATION AND THEY HOLD FIFTY PERCENT OF THE HIV INFECTED HIV
HansRosling_2009 ALL OVER THE WORLD LOOK YOU HAVE BUBBLES ALL OVER THE WORLD HERE BRAZIL HAS MANY HIV INFECTED ARAB COUNTRIES NOT SO MUCH BUT IRAN IS QUITE HIGH THEY HAVE HEROIN ADDICTION AND ALSO PROSTITUTION IN IRAN
HansRosling_2009 INDIA HAS MANY BECAUSE THEY ARE MANY SOUTHEAST ASIA AND SO ON BUT THERE IS ONE PART OF AFRICA AND THE DIFFICULT THING IS AT THE SAME TIME NOT TO MAKE A UNIFORM STATEMENT ABOUT AFRICA NOT TO COME TO SIMPLE
HansRosling_2009 IDEAS OF WHY IT IS LIKE THIS ON ONE HAND ON THE OTHER HAND BECAUSE THERE IS A SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS
HansRosling_2009 ABOUT THIS PATTERN NOW UNAIDS HAVE MADE GOOD DATA AVAILABLE FINALLY ABOUT THE SPREAD OF HIV
HansRosling_2009 IT COULD BE CONCURRENCY IT COULD BE SOME VIRUS TYPES IT COULD BE THAT THERE IS
HansRosling_2009 BUT AND IF YOU ARE IN AN UNFAVORABLE SITUATION MORE SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES IT CAN BE ONE IN ONE HUNDRED BUT
HansRosling_2009 WHAT WE THINK IS THAT IT COULD BE CONCURRENCY AND WHAT IS CONCURRENCY IN SWEDEN WE HAVE NO CONCURRENCY WE HAVE SERIAL MONOGAMY
HansRosling_2009 VODKA NEW YEAR 'S EVE NEW PARTNER FOR THE SPRING VODKA MIDSUMMER 'S EVE NEW PARTNER FOR THE FALL VODKA AND IT GOES ON LIKE THIS YOU KNOW AND YOU COLLECT A BIG NUMBER OF EXES AND WE HAVE A TERRIBLE CHLAMYDIA
HansRosling_2009 YOU CAN GET THIS CHART FREE WE HAVE UPLOADED UNAIDS DATA ON GAPMINDER ORG AND WE HOPE THAT WHEN WE ACT ON GLOBAL PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE
HansRosling_2009 WE WILL NOT ONLY HAVE THE HEART WE WILL NOT ONLY HAVE THE MONEY BUT WE WILL ALSO USE THE BRAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
