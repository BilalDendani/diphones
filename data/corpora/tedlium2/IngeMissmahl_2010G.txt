IngeMissmahl_2010G@41.44:48.19 SO I AM A JUNGIAN PSYCHOANALYST AND I WENT TO AFGHANISTAN IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR BY CHANCE ON AN ASSIGNMENT
IngeMissmahl_2010G@55.86:67.39 IS ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD AND SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE ILLITERATE WAR AND MALNUTRITION KILLS PEOPLE TOGETHER WITH HOPE YOU MAY KNOW THIS FROM THE MEDIA
IngeMissmahl_2010G@67.73:77.96 BUT WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW IS THAT THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE AFGHAN PEOPLE IS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD WHICH MEANS THEY GROW UP IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT AND I REPEAT MYSELF IN THIRTY YEARS
IngeMissmahl_2010G@80.13:86.27 THIS TRANSLATES INTO ONGOING VIOLENCE FOREIGN INTERESTS BRIBERY
IngeMissmahl_2010G@87.01:94.13 ETHNIC CONFLICTS BAD HEALTH SHAME FEAR AND CUMULATIVE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES
IngeMissmahl_2010G@95.38:103.91 LOCAL AND FOREIGN MILITARY ARE SUPPOSED TO BUILD PEACE TOGETHER WITH THE DONORS AND THE GOVERNMENTAL AND NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PEOPLE HAD HOPE YES
IngeMissmahl_2010G@104.63:110.59 BUT UNTIL THEY REALIZED THEIR SITUATION WORSENS EVERY DAY EITHER BECAUSE THEY ARE BEING KILLED
IngeMissmahl_2010G@111.79:116.25 BECAUSE SOMEHOW THEY ARE POORER THAN EIGHT YEARS AGO
IngeMissmahl_2010G@116.91:123.22 FIGURE FOR THAT FIFTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE YEARS SUFFER FROM MALNUTRITION
IngeMissmahl_2010G@124.11:125.66 YET THERE IS HOPE
IngeMissmahl_2010G@126.46:133.38 ONE DAY A MAN TOLD ME MY FUTURE DOES NOT LOOK BRILLIANT BUT I WANT TO HAVE A BRILLIANT FUTURE FOR MY SON
IngeMissmahl_2010G@134.35:144.75 THIS IS A PICTURE I TOOK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE WALKING ON FRIDAYS OVER THE HILLS IN KABUL AND FOR ME IT'S A SYMBOLIC PICTURE OF AN OPEN FUTURE FOR A YOUNG GENERATION
IngeMissmahl_2010G@147.67:147.99 SO
IngeMissmahl_2010G@156.32:158.46 BY BUILDING SCHOOLS AND ROADS
IngeMissmahl_2010G@170.21:173.71 TO COPE WITH IT TO GET OVER IT
IngeMissmahl_2010G@174.46:182.65 SO SOON AFTER MY ARRIVAL I HAD CONFIRMED SOMETHING WHICH I HAD ALREADY KNOWN THAT MY INSTRUMENTS COME FROM THE HEART OF MODERN EUROPE YES HOWEVER
IngeMissmahl_2010G@183.01:192.78 WHAT CAN WOUND US AND OUR REACTION TO THOSE WOUNDS THEY ARE UNIVERSAL AND THE BIG CHALLENGE WAS HOW TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE SYMPTOM
IngeMissmahl_2010G@193.38:205.88 IN THIS SPECIFIC CULTURAL CONTEXT AFTER A COUNSELING SESSION A WOMAN SAID TO ME BECAUSE YOU HAVE FELT ME I CAN FEEL MYSELF AGAIN AND I WANT TO PARTICIPATE AGAIN IN MY FAMILY
IngeMissmahl_2010G@208.15:213.12 THIS WAS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE FAMILY IS CENTRAL IN AFGHANS
IngeMissmahl_2010G@213.94:223.26 SOCIAL SYSTEM NO ONE CAN SURVIVE ALONE AND IF PEOPLE FEEL USED WORTHLESS AND ASHAMED BECAUSE SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAS HAPPENED TO THEM
IngeMissmahl_2010G@223.73:236.80 THEN THEY RETREAT AND THEY FALL INTO SOCIAL ISOLATION AND THEY DO NOT DARE TO TELL THIS EVIL TO OTHER PEOPLE OR TO THEIR LOVED ONES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT TO BURDEN THEM AND VERY OFTEN VIOLENCE IS A WAY TO COPE
IngeMissmahl_2010G@252.88:258.63 AND THEY CANNOT CONTROL IT TO COMPENSATE THIS LOSS OF INNER CONTROL
IngeMissmahl_2010G@259.32:266.85 THEY TRY TO CONTROL THE OUTSIDE VERY UNDERSTANDABLY MOSTLY THE FAMILY AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS FITS VERY WELL
IngeMissmahl_2010G@267.52:273.89 INTO THE TRADITIONAL SIDE REGRESSIVE SIDE REPRESSIVE SIDE RESTRICTIVE SIDE OF THE CULTURAL
IngeMissmahl_2010G@276.61:277.09 SO
IngeMissmahl_2010G@283.82:286.81 THEY DID NOT WANT TO DO THIS IT JUST HAPPENED THEY LOST CONTROL
IngeMissmahl_2010G@288.78:290.30 THE DESPERATE TRY
IngeMissmahl_2010G@292.39:293.62 AND NORMALITY
IngeMissmahl_2010G@294.43:302.32 AND IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO CUT THIS CIRCLE OF VIOLENCE IT WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE NEXT GENERATION WITHOUT A DOUBT AND PARTLY THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING
IngeMissmahl_2010G@304.14:308.20 SO EVERYBODY NEEDS A SENSE FOR THE FUTURE AND THE AFGHAN SENSE OF THE FUTURE
IngeMissmahl_2010G@313.46:322.24 LET ME REPEAT THE WORDS OF THE WOMAN BECAUSE YOU HAVE FELT ME I CAN FEEL MYSELF AGAIN SO THE KEY HERE IS EMPATHY
IngeMissmahl_2010G@334.75:336.52 EVERYBODY MUST BE ABLE
IngeMissmahl_2010G@336.97:338.02 TO KNOW WHAT
IngeMissmahl_2010G@350.67:364.52 TO COPE WITH IT AND TO LEARN FROM IT AND I WANT TO ENGAGE MYSELF IN THE BRIGHT FUTURE FOR MY CHILDREN AND THE CHILDREN OF MY CHILDREN AND I WILL NOT MARRY OFF MY THIRTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHAT HAPPENS TOO OFTEN IN AFGHANISTAN
IngeMissmahl_2010G@365.36:378.42 SO SOMETHING CAN BE DONE EVEN IN SUCH EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS AS AFGHANISTAN AND I STARTED THINKING ABOUT A COUNSELING PROGRAM BUT OF COURSE I NEEDED HELP AND FUNDS AND ONE EVENING I WAS SITTING NEXT TO A VERY NICE GENTLEMAN IN KABUL AND
IngeMissmahl_2010G@378.88:388.65 HE ASKED WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE GOOD IN AFGHANISTAN AND I EXPLAINED TO HIM QUICKLY I WOULD TRAIN PSYCHO SOCIAL COUNSELORS I WOULD OPEN CENTERS AND I EXPLAINED TO HIM
IngeMissmahl_2010G@390.86:395.80 THIS MAN GAVE ME HIS CONTACT DETAILS AT THE END OF THE EVENING AND SAID IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS CALL ME
IngeMissmahl_2010G@396.74:401.06 AT THAT TIME IT WAS THE HEAD OF CARITAS GERMANY SO
IngeMissmahl_2010G@401.33:409.77 I WAS ABLE TO LAUNCH A THREE YEAR PROJECT WITH CARITAS GERMANY AND WE TRAINED THIRTY AFGHAN WOMEN AND MEN AND WE OPENED FIFTEEN COUNSELING CENTERS IN KABUL
IngeMissmahl_2010G@410.33:416.47 THIS WAS OUR SIGN IT'S HAND PAINTED AND WE HAD FORTY FIVE ALL OVER KABUL ELEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE
IngeMissmahl_2010G@439.32:448.39 BEEN TAKING PLACE THE EUROPEAN UNION DELEGATION IN KABUL CAME INTO THIS AND HIRED ME TO WORK INSIDE THE MINISTRY OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO LOBBY THIS APPROACH
IngeMissmahl_2010G@451.20:460.50 REVISED THE MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT OF THE PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES BY ADDING PSYCHO SOCIAL CARE AND PSYCHO SOCIAL COUNSELORS TO THE SYSTEM
IngeMissmahl_2010G@461.16:473.78 MEANS CERTAINLY TO RETRAIN ALL HEALTH STAFF BUT FOR THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THE TRAINING MANUALS WHICH ARE APPROVED BY THE MINISTRY AND MOREOVER THIS APPROACH IS NOW PART OF THE MENTAL HEALTH STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN
IngeMissmahl_2010G@475.08:482.52 SO WE ALSO HAVE IMPLEMENTED IT ALREADY IN SOME SELECTED CLINICS IN THREE PROVINCES AND YOU ARE THE FIRST TO SEE THE RESULTS
IngeMissmahl_2010G@483.17:493.63 WE WANTED TO KNOW IF WHAT IS BEING DONE IS EFFECTIVE AND HERE YOU CAN SEE THE PATIENTS ALL HAD SYMPTOMS OF
IngeMissmahl_2010G@503.48:509.10 THE GREEN LINE IS TREATMENT WITH PSYCHO SOCIAL COUNSELING ONLY WITHOUT MEDICATION AND YOU CAN SEE THE SYMPTOMS
IngeMissmahl_2010G@519.36:526.63 TO COPE WITH THEM SO THIS MAKES US VERY HAPPY BECAUSE NOW WE ALSO HAVE SOME EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS WORKING
IngeMissmahl_2010G@527.45:539.64 SO HERE YOU SEE THIS IS A HEALTH FACILITY IN NORTHERN AFGHANISTAN AND EVERY MORNING IT LOOKS LIKE THIS ALL OVER AND DOCTORS USUALLY HAVE THREE TO SIX MINUTES FOR THE PATIENTS BUT NOW THIS WILL CHANGE
IngeMissmahl_2010G@540.03:552.34 THEY GO TO THE CLINICS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO CURE THEIR IMMEDIATE SYMPTOMS AND THEY WILL FIND SOMEBODY TO TALK TO AND DISCUSS THESE ISSUES AND TALK ABOUT WHAT IS BURDENING THEM AND FIND SOLUTIONS DEVELOP THEIR RESOURCES
IngeMissmahl_2010G@552.93:563.97 LEARN TOOLS TO SOLVE THEIR FAMILY CONFLICTS AND GAIN SOME CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE ONE SHORT VIGNETTE ONE
IngeMissmahl_2010G@566.19:570.34 TO HIS PASHTUN COUNSELOR IF WE WERE TO HAVE MET SOME YEARS AGO
IngeMissmahl_2010G@571.03:583.98 THEN WE WOULD HAVE KILLED EACH OTHER AND NOW YOU ARE HELPING ME TO REGAIN SOME CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE AND ANOTHER COUNSELOR SAID TO ME AFTER THE TRAINING YOU KNOW I NEVER KNEW WHY I SURVIVED THE KILLINGS IN MY VILLAGE
IngeMissmahl_2010G@584.91:586.76 NOW I KNOW BECAUSE
IngeMissmahl_2010G@586.86:598.94 I AM PART OF A NUCLEUS OF A NEW PEACEFUL SOCIETY IN AFGHANISTAN SO I BELIEVE THIS KEPT ME RUNNING AND THIS IS A REALLY EMANCIPATORY AND POLITICAL CONTRIBUTION TO PEACE AND
IngeMissmahl_2010G@600.93:611.43 AND ALSO I THINK WITHOUT PSYCHO SOCIAL THERAPY AND WITHOUT CONSIDERING THIS IN ALL HUMANITARIAN PROJECTS WE CANNOT BUILD UP CIVIL SOCIETIES
IngeMissmahl_2010G@612.07:621.67 I THOUGHT IT WAS AN IDEA WORTH SPREADING AND I THINK IT MUST BE CAN BE COULD BE REPLICATED ELSEWHERE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
