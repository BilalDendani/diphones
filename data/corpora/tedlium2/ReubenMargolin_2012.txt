ReubenMargolin_2012@33.8:35.8 THIS IS THE DOUBLE RAINDROP
ReubenMargolin_2012@36.29:38.69 OF ALL MY SCULPTURES IT 'S THE MOST TALKATIVE
ReubenMargolin_2012@43.96:54.35 IT ADDS TOGETHER THE INTERFERENCE PATTERN FROM TWO RAINDROPS THAT LAND NEAR EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF EXPANDING CIRCLES THEY 'RE EXPANDING HEXAGONS
ReubenMargolin_2012@60.37:63.26 ALL THE SCULPTURES MOVE BY MECHANICAL MEANS
ReubenMargolin_2012@141.47:143.38 A SINGLE DROP OF RAIN
ReubenMargolin_2012@144.29:146.07 INCREASING AMPLITUDE
ReubenMargolin_2012@193.12:197.38 THE MECHANISM THAT DRIVES IT HAS NINE MOTORS AND ABOUT THREE THOUSAND PULLEYS
ReubenMargolin_2012@208.21:212.02 FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE STRINGS IN A THREE DIMENSIONAL WEAVE
ReubenMargolin_2012@212.75:215.1 TRANSFERRED TO A LARGER SCALE
ReubenMargolin_2012@215.71:217.84 ACTUALLY A LOT LARGER WITH A LOT OF HELP
ReubenMargolin_2012@218.59:222.05 FOURTEEN THOUSAND AND SIXTY FOUR BICYCLE REFLECTORS
ReubenMargolin_2012@223.04:224.91 A TWENTY DAY INSTALL
ReubenMargolin_2012@245.1:249.69 CONNECTED IS A COLLABORATION WITH CHOREOGRAPHER GIDEON OBARZANEK
ReubenMargolin_2012@250.85:253.02 STRINGS ATTACHED TO DANCERS
ReubenMargolin_2012@254.31:260.97 THIS IS VERY EARLY REHEARSAL FOOTAGE BUT THE FINISHED WORK 'S ON TOUR AND IS ACTUALLY COMING THROUGH L A IN A COUPLE WEEKS
ReubenMargolin_2012@293.44:295.93 TAKE YOUR FINGER AND DRAW THIS LINE
ReubenMargolin_2012@296.39:298.49 SUMMER FALL
ReubenMargolin_2012@298.55:300.57 WINTER SPRING
ReubenMargolin_2012@312.58:317.55 DID YOU KNOW THAT 'S A CONTINUOUS SHEET OF CLOUD THAT 'S DIPPING IN AND OUT OF THE CONDENSATION LAYER
ReubenMargolin_2012@318.77:327.26 WHAT IF EVERY SEEMINGLY ISOLATED OBJECT WAS ACTUALLY JUST WHERE THE CONTINUOUS WAVE OF THAT OBJECT POKED THROUGH INTO OUR WORLD
ReubenMargolin_2012@352.74:358.75 AND YOU MIGHT SAY SURELY RUEBEN IF YOU TOOK EVEN JUST THE SLIGHTEST STEP BACK THE CYCLES OF
ReubenMargolin_2012@358.75:364.11 HUNGER AND EATING WAKING AND SLEEPING LAUGHING AND CRYING WOULD EMERGE AS PATTERN
ReubenMargolin_2012@365.32:367.2 BUT I WOULD SAY IF I DID THAT
ReubenMargolin_2012@368.25:369.9 TOO MUCH WOULD BE LOST
ReubenMargolin_2012@372.38:375.6 THIS TENSION BETWEEN THE NEED TO LOOK DEEPER
ReubenMargolin_2012@376.76:382.27 AND THE BEAUTY AND IMMEDIACY OF THE WORLD WHERE IF YOU EVEN TRY TO LOOK DEEPER YOU 'VE ALREADY MISSED WHAT YOU 'RE LOOKING FOR
ReubenMargolin_2012@382.93:388.2 THIS TENSION IS WHAT MAKES THE SCULPTURES MOVE AND FOR ME THE PATH BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES
ReubenMargolin_2012@388.24:390.02 TAKES THE SHAPE OF A WAVE
ReubenMargolin_2012@483.83:487.86 AND DOES IT EVER CHANGE DO YOU THINK YOU 'RE DESIGNING ONE THING AND THEN WHEN IT 'S PRODUCED IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING ELSE
ReubenMargolin_2012@495.36:504.44 I ACTUALLY HATED IT THE VERY MOMENT I TURNED IT ON I HATED IT IT WAS LIKE A REALLY DEEP DOWN GUT REACTION AND I WANTED TO THROW IT OUT
ReubenMargolin_2012@505.03:508.69 AND I HAPPENED TO HAVE A FRIEND WHO WAS OVER AND HE SAID WHY DON 'T YOU JUST WAIT
ReubenMargolin_2012@509.08:523.37 AND I WAITED AND THE NEXT DAY I LIKED IT A BIT BETTER THE NEXT DAY I LIKED IT A BIT BETTER AND NOW I REALLY LOVE IT AND SO I GUESS ONE THE GUT REACTIONS A LITTLE BIT WRONG SOMETIMES AND TWO IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE AS EXPECTED
