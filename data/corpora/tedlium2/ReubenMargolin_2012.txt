ReubenMargolin_2012 THEN I JUST LOVE IT AND I 'LL CUT SOME WOOD AND DRILL SOME HOLES AND WATCH THE WATER AND MAYBE I 'LL HAVE TO WALK AROUND AND LOOK FOR WASHERS YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH TIME I SPEND
ReubenMargolin_2012 THIS IS THE DOUBLE RAINDROP
ReubenMargolin_2012 OF ALL MY SCULPTURES IT 'S THE MOST TALKATIVE
ReubenMargolin_2012 IT ADDS TOGETHER THE INTERFERENCE PATTERN FROM TWO RAINDROPS THAT LAND NEAR EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF EXPANDING CIRCLES THEY 'RE EXPANDING HEXAGONS
ReubenMargolin_2012 ALL THE SCULPTURES MOVE BY MECHANICAL MEANS
ReubenMargolin_2012 A SINGLE DROP OF RAIN
ReubenMargolin_2012 INCREASING AMPLITUDE
ReubenMargolin_2012 THE MECHANISM THAT DRIVES IT HAS NINE MOTORS AND ABOUT THREE THOUSAND PULLEYS
ReubenMargolin_2012 FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE STRINGS IN A THREE DIMENSIONAL WEAVE
ReubenMargolin_2012 TRANSFERRED TO A LARGER SCALE
ReubenMargolin_2012 ACTUALLY A LOT LARGER WITH A LOT OF HELP
ReubenMargolin_2012 FOURTEEN THOUSAND AND SIXTY FOUR BICYCLE REFLECTORS
ReubenMargolin_2012 A TWENTY DAY INSTALL
ReubenMargolin_2012 CONNECTED IS A COLLABORATION WITH CHOREOGRAPHER GIDEON OBARZANEK
ReubenMargolin_2012 STRINGS ATTACHED TO DANCERS
ReubenMargolin_2012 THIS IS VERY EARLY REHEARSAL FOOTAGE BUT THE FINISHED WORK 'S ON TOUR AND IS ACTUALLY COMING THROUGH L A IN A COUPLE WEEKS
ReubenMargolin_2012 TAKE YOUR FINGER AND DRAW THIS LINE
ReubenMargolin_2012 SUMMER FALL
ReubenMargolin_2012 WINTER SPRING
ReubenMargolin_2012 DID YOU KNOW THAT 'S A CONTINUOUS SHEET OF CLOUD THAT 'S DIPPING IN AND OUT OF THE CONDENSATION LAYER
ReubenMargolin_2012 WHAT IF EVERY SEEMINGLY ISOLATED OBJECT WAS ACTUALLY JUST WHERE THE CONTINUOUS WAVE OF THAT OBJECT POKED THROUGH INTO OUR WORLD
ReubenMargolin_2012 AND YOU MIGHT SAY SURELY RUEBEN IF YOU TOOK EVEN JUST THE SLIGHTEST STEP BACK THE CYCLES OF
ReubenMargolin_2012 HUNGER AND EATING WAKING AND SLEEPING LAUGHING AND CRYING WOULD EMERGE AS PATTERN
ReubenMargolin_2012 BUT I WOULD SAY IF I DID THAT
ReubenMargolin_2012 TOO MUCH WOULD BE LOST
ReubenMargolin_2012 THIS TENSION BETWEEN THE NEED TO LOOK DEEPER
ReubenMargolin_2012 AND THE BEAUTY AND IMMEDIACY OF THE WORLD WHERE IF YOU EVEN TRY TO LOOK DEEPER YOU 'VE ALREADY MISSED WHAT YOU 'RE LOOKING FOR
ReubenMargolin_2012 THIS TENSION IS WHAT MAKES THE SCULPTURES MOVE AND FOR ME THE PATH BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES
ReubenMargolin_2012 TAKES THE SHAPE OF A WAVE
ReubenMargolin_2012 AND DOES IT EVER CHANGE DO YOU THINK YOU 'RE DESIGNING ONE THING AND THEN WHEN IT 'S PRODUCED IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING ELSE
ReubenMargolin_2012 I ACTUALLY HATED IT THE VERY MOMENT I TURNED IT ON I HATED IT IT WAS LIKE A REALLY DEEP DOWN GUT REACTION AND I WANTED TO THROW IT OUT
ReubenMargolin_2012 AND I HAPPENED TO HAVE A FRIEND WHO WAS OVER AND HE SAID WHY DON 'T YOU JUST WAIT
ReubenMargolin_2012 AND I WAITED AND THE NEXT DAY I LIKED IT A BIT BETTER THE NEXT DAY I LIKED IT A BIT BETTER AND NOW I REALLY LOVE IT AND SO I GUESS ONE THE GUT REACTIONS A LITTLE BIT WRONG SOMETIMES AND TWO IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE AS EXPECTED
