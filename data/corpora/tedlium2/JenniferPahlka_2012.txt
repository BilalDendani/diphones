JenniferPahlka_2012@17.6:29.33 AGO I STARTED A PROGRAM TO TRY TO GET THE ROCKSTAR TECH AND DESIGN PEOPLE TO TAKE A YEAR OFF AND WORK IN THE ONE ENVIRONMENT THAT REPRESENTS PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THEY 'RE SUPPOSED TO HATE
JenniferPahlka_2012@29.62:31.32 WE HAVE THEM WORK IN GOVERNMENT
JenniferPahlka_2012@33.59:43.62 THE PROGRAM IS CALLED CODE FOR AMERICA AND IT 'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE A PEACE CORPS FOR GEEKS WE SELECT A FEW FELLOWS EVERY YEAR AND WE HAVE THEM WORK WITH CITY GOVERNMENTS
JenniferPahlka_2012@43.62:55.76 INSTEAD OF SENDING THEM OFF INTO THE THIRD WORLD WE SEND THEM INTO THE WILDS OF CITY HALL AND THERE THEY MAKE GREAT APPS THEY WORK WITH CITY STAFFERS BUT REALLY WHAT THEY 'RE DOING IS THEY 'RE SHOWING WHAT 'S POSSIBLE WITH TECHNOLOGY TODAY
JenniferPahlka_2012@60.7:71.66 HERE IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE HE 'S LOOKING FOR A DATE BUT WHAT HE 'S REALLY LOOKING FOR IS FOR SOMEONE TO SHOVEL HIM OUT WHEN HE GETS SNOWED IN BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE 'S NOT VERY GOOD AT FIGHTING FIRES WHEN HE 'S COVERED IN FOUR FEET OF SNOW NOW
JenniferPahlka_2012@71.74:75.25 NOW HOW DID HE COME TO BE LOOKING FOR HELP IN THIS VERY UNIQUE MANNER
JenniferPahlka_2012@76.01:87.17 WE HAD A TEAM OF FELLOWS IN BOSTON LAST YEAR THROUGH THE CODE FOR AMERICA PROGRAM THEY WERE THERE IN FEBRUARY AND IT SNOWED A LOT IN FEBRUARY LAST YEAR AND THEY NOTICED THAT THE CITY NEVER GETS TO DIGGING OUT THESE FIRE HYDRANTS
JenniferPahlka_2012@87.17:96.39 BUT ONE FELLOW IN PARTICULAR A GUY NAMED ERIK MICHAELS OBER NOTICED SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT 'S THAT CITIZENS ARE SHOVELING OUT SIDEWALKS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THESE THINGS
JenniferPahlka_2012@96.76:99.77 SO HE DID WHAT ANY GOOD DEVELOPER WOULD DO HE WROTE AN APP
JenniferPahlka_2012@108.73:113.69 AND IF YOU DON 'T SOMEONE CAN STEAL IT FROM YOU SO IT 'S GOT CUTE LITTLE GAME DYNAMICS ON IT
JenniferPahlka_2012@114.71:123.63 THIS IS A MODEST LITTLE APP IT 'S PROBABLY THE SMALLEST OF THE TWENTY ONE APPS THAT THE FELLOWS WROTE LAST YEAR BUT IT 'S DOING SOMETHING THAT NO OTHER GOVERNMENT TECHNOLOGY DOES
JenniferPahlka_2012@126.39:136.59 'S A GUY IN THE I T DEPARTMENT OF THE CITY OF HONOLULU WHO SAW THIS APP AND REALIZED THAT HE COULD USE IT NOT FOR SNOW BUT TO GET CITIZENS TO ADOPT TSUNAMI
JenniferPahlka_2012@154.63:162.72 SO WE NOW KNOW OF NINE CITIES THAT ARE PLANNING TO USE THIS AND THIS HAS SPREAD JUST FRICTIONLESSLY ORGANICALLY NATURALLY
JenniferPahlka_2012@168.39:171.38 PROCURING SOFTWARE USUALLY TAKES A COUPLE OF YEARS
JenniferPahlka_2012@171.74:181.69 WE HAD A TEAM THAT WORKED ON A PROJECT IN BOSTON LAST YEAR THAT TOOK THREE PEOPLE ABOUT TWO AND A HALF MONTHS IT WAS A WAY THAT PARENTS COULD FIGURE OUT WHICH WERE THE RIGHT PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR THEIR KIDS
JenniferPahlka_2012@182.18:190.46 WE WERE TOLD AFTERWARD THAT IF THAT HAD GONE THROUGH NORMAL CHANNELS IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN AT LEAST TWO YEARS AND IT WOULD HAVE COST ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS
JenniferPahlka_2012@191.09:200.52 AND THAT 'S NOTHING THERE IS ONE PROJECT IN THE CALIFORNIA COURT SYSTEM RIGHT NOW THAT SO FAR COST TAXPAYERS TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND IT DOESN 'T WORK
JenniferPahlka_2012@200.91:204.21 AND THERE ARE PROJECTS LIKE THIS AT EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT
JenniferPahlka_2012@204.98:206.66 SO AN APP THAT TAKES
JenniferPahlka_2012@222.91:225.19 BUT MORE LIKE THE INTERNET ITSELF
JenniferPahlka_2012@225.53:227.37 AND THAT MEANS PERMISSIONLESS
JenniferPahlka_2012@227.5:230.31 IT MEANS OPEN IT MEANS GENERATIVE
JenniferPahlka_2012@231.83:245.9 AND THAT 'S IMPORTANT BUT WHAT 'S MORE IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS APP IS THAT IT REPRESENTS HOW A NEW GENERATION IS TACKLING THE PROBLEM OF GOVERNMENT NOT AS THE PROBLEM OF AN OSSIFIED INSTITUTION BUT AS A PROBLEM OF COLLECTIVE ACTION
JenniferPahlka_2012@252.78:258.81 NOW THERE 'S A VERY LARGE COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE BUILDING THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED TO DO THINGS TOGETHER EFFECTIVELY
JenniferPahlka_2012@259.01:264.88 IT 'S NOT JUST CODE FOR AMERICA FELLOWS THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY THAT ARE STANDING AND WRITING CIVIC
JenniferPahlka_2012@265.2:267.81 EVERY DAY IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES
JenniferPahlka_2012@268.69:270.96 THEY HAVEN 'T GIVEN UP ON GOVERNMENT
JenniferPahlka_2012@271.22:276.47 THEY ARE FRUSTRATED AS HELL WITH IT BUT THEY 'RE NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT IT THEY 'RE FIXING IT
JenniferPahlka_2012@289.13:293.21 GOVERNMENT IS AT ITS CORE IN THE WORDS OF TIM O 'REILLY
JenniferPahlka_2012@293.51:296.4 WHAT WE DO TOGETHER THAT WE CAN 'T DO ALONE
JenniferPahlka_2012@298.85:305.08 NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN UP ON GOVERNMENT AND IF YOU 'RE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE I WOULD ASK THAT YOU RECONSIDER
JenniferPahlka_2012@305.6:307.26 BECAUSE THINGS ARE CHANGING
JenniferPahlka_2012@307.86:311.86 POLITICS IS NOT CHANGING GOVERNMENT IS CHANGING
JenniferPahlka_2012@312.09:318.14 AND BECAUSE GOVERNMENT ULTIMATELY DERIVES ITS POWER FROM US REMEMBER WE THE PEOPLE
JenniferPahlka_2012@318.48:322.07 HOW WE THINK ABOUT IT IS GOING TO EFFECT HOW THAT CHANGE HAPPENS
JenniferPahlka_2012@323.13:330.7 NOW I DIDN 'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT GOVERNMENT WHEN I STARTED THIS PROGRAM AND LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE I THOUGHT GOVERNMENT WAS BASICALLY ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE ELECTED TO OFFICE
JenniferPahlka_2012@346.17:355.01 IF YOU SHOULD EVER HAVE THE CHANCE TO STAFF YOUR CITY 'S CALL CENTER AS OUR FELLOW SCOTT SILVERMAN DID AS PART OF THE PROGRAM IN FACT THEY ALL DO THAT YOU WILL FIND
JenniferPahlka_2012@355.28:375.19 THAT PEOPLE CALL GOVERNMENT WITH A VERY WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES INCLUDING HAVING AN OPOSSUM STUCK IN YOUR HOUSE SO SCOTT GETS THIS CALL HE TYPES OPOSSUM INTO THIS OFFICIAL KNOWLEDGE BASE HE DOESN 'T REALLY COME UP WITH ANYTHING HE STARTS WITH ANIMAL CONTROL AND FINALLY HE SAYS LOOK CAN YOU JUST OPEN ALL THE DOORS TO YOUR HOUSE AND PLAY MUSIC REALLY LOUD AND SEE IF THE THING LEAVES
JenniferPahlka_2012@378.83:398.19 BUT THAT WASN 'T THE END OF THE OPOSSUMS BOSTON DOESN 'T JUST HAVE A CALL CENTER IT HAS AN APP A WEB AND MOBILE APP CALLED CITIZENS CONNECT NOW WE DIDN 'T WRITE THIS APP THIS IS THE WORK OF THE VERY SMART PEOPLE AT THE OFFICE OF NEW URBAN MECHANICS IN BOSTON SO ONE DAY THIS IS AN ACTUAL REPORT THIS CAME IN OPOSSUM IN MY TRASHCAN CAN 'T TELL IF
JenniferPahlka_2012@440.52:448.06 AND I DON 'T MEAN NECESSARILY A TECHNOLOGICAL DEFINITION OF PLATFORM HERE I 'M JUST TALKING ABOUT A PLATFORM FOR PEOPLE TO HELP THEMSELVES
JenniferPahlka_2012@457.48:469.44 AND IT COULD HAVE CONNECTED THEM WITH GOVERNMENT SERVICES IF THEY 'D BEEN NEEDED BUT A NEIGHBOR IS A FAR BETTER AND CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE TO GOVERNMENT SERVICES WHEN ONE NEIGHBOR HELPS ANOTHER WE STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITIES
JenniferPahlka_2012@469.7:473.49 WE CALL ANIMAL CONTROL IT JUST COSTS A LOT OF MONEY
JenniferPahlka_2012@474.5:481.61 NOW ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT GOVERNMENT IS THAT IT 'S NOT THE SAME THING AS POLITICS AND MOST PEOPLE GET THAT
JenniferPahlka_2012@481.67:487.61 BUT THEY THINK THAT ONE IS THE INPUT TO THE OTHER THAT OUR INPUT TO THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IS VOTING
JenniferPahlka_2012@488.45:495.41 NOW HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE ELECTED A POLITICAL LEADER AND SOMETIMES WE SPEND A LOT OF ENERGY GETTING A NEW POLITICAL LEADER ELECTED
JenniferPahlka_2012@495.75:501.09 AND THEN WE SIT BACK AND WE EXPECT GOVERNMENT TO REFLECT OUR VALUES AND MEET OUR NEEDS
JenniferPahlka_2012@502.2:504.49 AND THEN NOT THAT MUCH CHANGES
JenniferPahlka_2012@505.56:511.96 THAT 'S BECAUSE GOVERNMENT IS LIKE A VAST OCEAN AND POLITICS IS THE SIX INCH LAYER ON TOP
JenniferPahlka_2012@512.6:515.93 AND WHAT 'S UNDER THAT IS WHAT WE CALL BUREAUCRACY
JenniferPahlka_2012@516.9:525.89 AND WE SAY THAT WORD WITH SUCH CONTEMPT BUT IT 'S THAT CONTEMPT THAT KEEPS THIS THING THAT WE OWN AND WE PAY FOR
JenniferPahlka_2012@526.59:529.85 AS SOMETHING THAT 'S WORKING AGAINST US THIS OTHER THING
JenniferPahlka_2012@530.18:532.67 AND THEN WE 'RE DISEMPOWERING OURSELVES
JenniferPahlka_2012@533.18:538.33 PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK POLITICS IS SEXY IF WE WANT THIS INSTITUTION TO WORK FOR US
JenniferPahlka_2012@538.37:544.55 WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE BUREAUCRACY SEXY BECAUSE THAT 'S WHERE THE REAL WORK OF GOVERNMENT HAPPENS
JenniferPahlka_2012@545.37:558.7 WE HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT SO THAT 'S OCCUPYTHESEC MOVEMENT HAS DONE HAVE YOU SEEN THESE GUYS IT 'S A GROUP OF CONCERNED CITIZENS THAT HAVE WRITTEN A VERY DETAILED THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PAGE REPORT
JenniferPahlka_2012@569.1:576.34 NOW FOR THOSE OF US WHO 'VE GIVEN UP ON GOVERNMENT IT 'S TIME THAT WE ASKED OURSELVES ABOUT THE WORLD THAT WE WANT TO LEAVE FOR OUR CHILDREN
JenniferPahlka_2012@576.82:580.95 YOU HAVE TO SEE THE ENORMOUS CHALLENGES THAT THEY 'RE GOING TO FACE
JenniferPahlka_2012@581.6:584.24 DO WE REALLY THINK WE 'RE GOING TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO GO
JenniferPahlka_2012@584.35:588.93 WITHOUT FIXING THE ONE INSTITUTION THAT CAN ACT ON BEHALF OF ALL OF US
JenniferPahlka_2012@589.43:594.35 WE CAN 'T DO WITHOUT GOVERNMENT BUT WE DO NEED IT TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE
JenniferPahlka_2012@594.56:603.13 THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT TECHNOLOGY IS MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO FUNDAMENTALLY REFRAME THE FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT IN A WAY THAT CAN ACTUALLY SCALE
JenniferPahlka_2012@603.46:615.63 BY STRENGTHENING CIVIL SOCIETY AND THERE 'S A GENERATION OUT THERE THAT 'S GROWN UP ON THE INTERNET AND THEY KNOW THAT IT 'S NOT THAT HARD TO DO THINGS TOGETHER YOU JUST HAVE TO ARCHITECT THE SYSTEMS THE RIGHT WAY
JenniferPahlka_2012@617.08:629.18 NOW THE AVERAGE AGE OF OUR FELLOWS IS TWENTY EIGHT SO I AM BEGRUDGINGLY ALMOST A GENERATION OLDER THAN MOST OF THEM THIS IS A GENERATION THAT 'S GROWN UP TAKING THEIR VOICES PRETTY MUCH FOR GRANTED
JenniferPahlka_2012@629.84:640.83 THEY 'RE NOT FIGHTING THAT BATTLE THAT WE 'RE ALL FIGHTING ABOUT WHO GETS TO SPEAK THEY ALL GET TO SPEAK THEY CAN EXPRESS THEIR OPINION ON ANY CHANNEL AT ANY TIME AND THEY DO
JenniferPahlka_2012@641.38:647.85 SO WHEN THEY 'RE FACED WITH THE PROBLEM OF GOVERNMENT THEY DON 'T CARE AS MUCH ABOUT USING THEIR VOICES
JenniferPahlka_2012@648.6:650.26 THEY 'RE USING THEIR HANDS
JenniferPahlka_2012@651.01:654.66 THEY 'RE USING THEIR HANDS TO WRITE APPLICATIONS THAT MAKE GOVERNMENT WORK BETTER
JenniferPahlka_2012@655.14:660.08 AND THOSE APPLICATIONS LET US USE OUR HANDS TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES BETTER
JenniferPahlka_2012@668.45:678.62 AND CERTAINLY WE COULD HAVE BEEN SHOVELING OUT THOSE FIRE HYDRANTS ALL ALONG AND MANY PEOPLE DO BUT THESE APPS ARE LIKE LITTLE DIGITAL REMINDERS THAT WE 'RE NOT JUST CONSUMERS
JenniferPahlka_2012@678.94:683.43 AND WE 'RE NOT JUST CONSUMERS OF GOVERNMENT PUTTING IN OUR TAXES AND GETTING BACK SERVICES
JenniferPahlka_2012@693.87:696.48 SO THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR ALL OF YOU HERE
JenniferPahlka_2012@697.53:701.12 WHEN IT COMES TO THE BIG IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO TOGETHER
JenniferPahlka_2012@701.52:703.54 ALL OF US TOGETHER
JenniferPahlka_2012@704.23:706.73 ARE WE JUST GOING TO BE A CROWD OF VOICES
JenniferPahlka_2012@707.22:710.93 OR ARE WE ALSO GOING TO BE A CROWD OF HANDS
