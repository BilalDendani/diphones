DeanKamen_2009P IT'S NOT ABOUT TECHNOLOGY IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE AND STORIES
DeanKamen_2009P I COULD SHOW YOU WHAT RECENTLY WAS ON TELEVISION AS A HIGH QUALITY VIDEO SIXTY MINUTES MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN IT AND IT WAS THE NOW DIRECTOR OF THE ENTIRE PIECE OF THE
DeanKamen_2009P WHO WAS ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THESE CRAZY DEVICES THAT DON'T WORK
DeanKamen_2009P AND IT TURNS OUT THAT WITH SIXTY MINUTES CAMERAS ROLLING IN THE BACKGROUND AFTER HE PRETTY MUCH MADE HIS POSITION CLEAR ON THIS HE HAD HIS HOOK AND HE HAD HIS
DeanKamen_2009P IT'S THE FIRST TIME HE 'S FELT LIKE HE 'S HAD AN ARM IN THIRTY NINE YEARS BUT THAT WOULD SORT OF BE JUMPING TO THE MIDDLE OF THE STORY
DeanKamen_2009P AND I'M NOT GOING TO SHOW YOU THAT POLISHED VIDEO I'M GOING TO INSTEAD IN A MINUTE OR TWO SHOW YOU AN EARLY CRUDE VIDEO BECAUSE
DeanKamen_2009P FEW YEARS AGO I WAS VISITED BY THE GUY THAT RUNS DARPA
DeanKamen_2009P PEOPLE THAT FUND ALL THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES THAT
DeanKamen_2009P THEY HAVE A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN ONES THAT WILL HELP OUR SOLDIERS
DeanKamen_2009P I GET THIS SORT OF UNREQUESTED BY ME ANYWAY VISIT
DeanKamen_2009P FROM THE MILITARY AND THE GUY THAT RUNS DARPA
DeanKamen_2009P THE MOST REMOTE PLACES THAT WE PUT SOLDIERS HILLS OF AFGHANISTAN IRAQ
DeanKamen_2009P THEY WERE QUITE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT
DeanKamen_2009P CAR ACCIDENT IN A MAJOR CITY IN THE UNITED STATES
DeanKamen_2009P PART OF THE FACE IT'S PROBABLY NOT COMING BACK
DeanKamen_2009P SO THEY STARTED GIVING ME THE STATISTICS ON HOW MANY OF THESE KIDS HAD LOST AN ARM AND THEN THE SURGEON POINTED OUT WITH A LOT OF ANGER
DeanKamen_2009P AT THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR THEY WERE SHOOTING EACH OTHER WITH MUSKETS IF SOMEBODY LOST AN ARM
DeanKamen_2009P WE GAVE THEM A WOODEN STICK WITH A HOOK ON IT
DeanKamen_2009P WE GIVE THEM A PLASTIC STICK WITH A HOOK ON IT
DeanKamen_2009P AND THEY BASICALLY SAID THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE
DeanKamen_2009P AND THEN THE PUNCHLINE SO DEAN WE'RE HERE BECAUSE YOU MAKE MEDICAL STUFF YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE US AN ARM
DeanKamen_2009P AND I WAS WAITING FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED PAGES OF BUREAUCRACY AND PAPERWORK AND
DeanKamen_2009P NO THE GUY SAYS
DeanKamen_2009P GUY INTO THIS CONFERENCE ROOM
DeanKamen_2009P AND WEARING THE ARM YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE US
DeanKamen_2009P HE OR SHE IS GOING TO PICK UP A RAISIN OR A GRAPE OFF THIS TABLE
DeanKamen_2009P THE WRIST FLEX AT THE ELBOW ABDUCT AND
DeanKamen_2009P EITHER WAY THEY
DeanKamen_2009P OH BY THE WAY DEAN IT'S GOING TO FIT ON A FIFTIETH PERCENTILE FEMALE FRAME NAMELY THIRTY TWO INCHES FROM THE LONG
DeanKamen_2009P BE COMPLETELY SELF CONTAINED INCLUDING ALL ITS POWER
DeanKamen_2009P SO THEY FINISHED THAT AND I AS YOU CAN TELL AM A BASHFUL GUY
DeanKamen_2009P I TOLD THEM THEY'RE
DeanKamen_2009P THE SURGEON SAYS TO ME DEAN YOU NEED TO KNOW
DeanKamen_2009P MORE THAN TWO DOZEN OF THESE KIDS HAVE COME BACK
DeanKamen_2009P I CAN NOT IMAGINE I'M SORRY YOU MAY HAVE
DeanKamen_2009P BUT COMPARED TO THAT LOSING TWO SEEMS LIKE
DeanKamen_2009P WOULD BE AN INCONVENIENCE
DeanKamen_2009P ANYWAY I WENT HOME THAT NIGHT I THOUGHT ABOUT IT I LITERALLY COULD NOT SLEEP
DeanKamen_2009P I
DeanKamen_2009P SO I DECIDED WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS
DeanKamen_2009P TRUST ME I'VE GOT A DAY JOB I'VE GOT A LOT OF DAY JOBS MOST OF MY DAY JOB KEEPS ME BUSY FUNDING MY FANTASIES LIKE FIRST AND WATER AND POWER AND I'VE GOT A LOT
DeanKamen_2009P BUT I
DeanKamen_2009P DID A LITTLE INVESTIGATION
DeanKamen_2009P I STILL THINK THEY'RE
DeanKamen_2009P WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE THINGS LIKE
DeanKamen_2009P GREAT HE SAID YOU GOT TWO YEARS
DeanKamen_2009P THAT'S UNDER NINE POUNDS THAT HAS ALL THAT CAPABILITY
DeanKamen_2009P WILL TAKE THE OTHER NINE TO MAKE IT FUNCTIONAL AND USEFUL
DeanKamen_2009P AGREED TO DISAGREE I WENT BACK AND I STARTED PUTTING THE TEAM TOGETHER THE BEST GUYS I COULD FIND WITH A PASSION TO DO THIS AT THE END OF EXACTLY ONE YEAR
DeanKamen_2009P WE HAD A DEVICE WITH FOURTEEN DEGREES OF FREEDOM ALL THE SENSORS ALL THE MICROPROCESSORS ALL THE STUFF INSIDE
DeanKamen_2009P I COULD SHOW YOU IT WITH A COSMESIS ON IT THAT'S SO REAL IT'S EERIE BUT THEN YOU WOULDN'T SEE ALL THIS COOL STUFF
DeanKamen_2009P I THINK YOU COULD SEE IN AIMEE 'S CAPABILITIES AND ATTITUDES
DeanKamen_2009P PEOPLE WITH A DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING
DeanKamen_2009P ARE QUITE REMARKABLE AND NATURE IS QUITE
DeanKamen_2009P LITERALLY HE 'S GOT NO SHOULDER ON ONE SIDE AND IT HIGH TRANS HUMERAL ON THE OTHER AND THAT'S CHUCK AND RANDY TOGETHER
DeanKamen_2009P AFTER TEN HOURS WERE PLAYING IN OUR OFFICE AND WE TOOK SOME PRETTY CRUDDY HOME MOVIES AT THE END OF THE ONE I'M GOING TO SHOW IT'S ONLY ABOUT A MINUTE AND A COUPLE OF SECONDS LONG
DeanKamen_2009P CHUCK DOES SOMETHING THAT TO THIS DAY I'M JEALOUS OF I CAN'T DO IT
DeanKamen_2009P HE PICKS UP A SPOON PICKS IT UP
DeanKamen_2009P SCOOPS OUT SOME SHREDDED WHEAT
DeanKamen_2009P I CAN NOT DO THAT
DeanKamen_2009P HIS WIFE WAS STANDING BEHIND ME SHE'S STANDING BEHIND ME AT THE TIME AND SHE SAYS DEAN
DeanKamen_2009P CHUCK HASN'T FED HIMSELF IN NINETEEN YEARS
DeanKamen_2009P SO YOU'VE GOT A CHOICE WE KEEP THE ARM
DeanKamen_2009P YOU KEEP
DeanKamen_2009P THIS IS CHUCK SHOWING
DeanKamen_2009P HE 'S PUNCHING OUR CONTROLS GUY THE GUY BEHIND HIM IS OUR ENGINEER SURGEON WHICH IS A CONVENIENT GUY TO HAVE AROUND
DeanKamen_2009P THERE'S RANDY THESE GUYS ARE PASSING A RUBBER LITTLE BALL BETWEEN THEM
DeanKamen_2009P AND JUST AS IN THE SPIRIT OF
DeanKamen_2009P FIRST GRACIOUS PROFESSIONALISM THEY ARE QUITE PROUD OF THIS SO THEY DECIDE TO SHARE
DeanKamen_2009P THIS IS A NON TRIVIAL THING TO DO BY THE WAY IMAGINE DOING THAT WITH A WOODEN STICK AND A HOOK ON THE END OF IT DOING
DeanKamen_2009P NOW CHUCK IS DOING SOMETHING QUITE EXTRAORDINARY AT LEAST FOR MY LIMITED PHYSICAL SKILL
DeanKamen_2009P AND NOW HE 'S GOING TO DO WHAT DARPA ASKED ME FOR HE 'S GOING TO PICK UP A GRAPE HE DIDN'T DROP IT HE DIDN'T BREAK IT
DeanKamen_2009P BUT AS I'VE LEARNED FROM RICHARD
DeanKamen_2009P I HADN'T DEALT WITH THIS KIND OF PROBLEM OR FRANKLY THIS WHOLE SEGMENT OF THE MEDICAL WORLD
DeanKamen_2009P I'LL GIVE YOU SOME ASTOUNDING THINGS
DeanKamen_2009P I PUT A BUNCH OF GUYS IN MY PLANE AND I SAID WE'RE FLYING DOWN TO WALTER REED AND WE'RE GOING TALK TO THESE KIDS BECAUSE FRANKLY IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER WE LIKE THIS ARM IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE LIKES
DeanKamen_2009P WHEN I TOLD THEM THAT THEY WEREN'T ENTIRELY ENTHUSIASTIC BUT I TOLD THEM IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEIR OPINION IS THERE IS ONLY ONE OPINION THAT MATTERS THE KIDS THAT ARE EITHER GOING TO USE IT
DeanKamen_2009P I TOLD A BUNCH OF MY ENGINEERS LOOK WE'RE GOING TO WALK INTO WALTER REED
DeanKamen_2009P AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE PEOPLE LOTS OF THEM
DeanKamen_2009P WE WALKED INTO WALTER REED AND I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG
DeanKamen_2009P WE DID SEE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
DeanKamen_2009P A LOT OF THEM MISSING A LOT OF BODY PARTS
DeanKamen_2009P AND PARTS THEY HAD LEFT WERE BURNED HALF A FACE GONE AN EAR BURNED
DeanKamen_2009P SITTING AT A TABLE THEY WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER FOR US AND WE STARTED ASKING THEM ALL QUESTIONS
DeanKamen_2009P I'D SAY TO THEM WE 'RE NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS NATURE YET
DeanKamen_2009P I COULD GIVE YOU FINE MOTOR CONTROL OR I COULD LET YOU CURL FORTY POUNDS
DeanKamen_2009P I PROBABLY CAN'T DO BOTH I CAN GIVE YOU FAST CONTROL
DeanKamen_2009P LOW REDUCTION RATIOS IN THESE GEARS OR I CAN GIVE YOU POWER I CAN'T GIVE YOU BOTH
DeanKamen_2009P AND WE WERE TRYING TO GET THEM TO ALL HELP US KNOW WHAT TO GIVE THEM
DeanKamen_2009P AND WOMAN
DeanKamen_2009P GIVEN ENOUGH WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU WE NEED DATA WE NEED TO
DeanKamen_2009P AFTER A HALF AN HOUR MAYBE THERE WAS ONE GUY AT THE FAR END OF THE TABLE WHO WASN'T SAYING MUCH YOU COULD SEE HE WAS MISSING AN
DeanKamen_2009P HE WAS LEANING ON HIS OTHER ARM
DeanKamen_2009P I CALLED DOWN TO THE END HEY YOU HAVEN'T SAID MUCH IF WE NEEDED THIS OR THIS WHAT WOULD YOU WANT AND HE SAID YOU KNOW
DeanKamen_2009P THE LUCKY GUY AT THIS TABLE I LOST
DeanKamen_2009P SO
DeanKamen_2009P MUCH HE HAD A GREAT SPIRIT LIKE ALL THE REST
DeanKamen_2009P AND HE MADE A FEW COMMENTS AND THE MEETING ENDED WE SAID GOODBYE TO ALL THESE
DeanKamen_2009P THEY GAVE IT TO US
DeanKamen_2009P THEY'RE NOT FINISHED GIVING
DeanKamen_2009P I STARTED WORKING HARDER
DeanKamen_2009P WENT OUT TO BROOKE ARMY MEDICAL CENTER
