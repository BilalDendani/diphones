DeanKamen_2009P@15.80:19.02 IT'S NOT ABOUT TECHNOLOGY IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE AND STORIES
DeanKamen_2009P@19.81:32.56 I COULD SHOW YOU WHAT RECENTLY WAS ON TELEVISION AS A HIGH QUALITY VIDEO SIXTY MINUTES MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN IT AND IT WAS THE NOW DIRECTOR OF THE ENTIRE PIECE OF THE
DeanKamen_2009P@40.15:44.41 WHO WAS ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THESE CRAZY DEVICES THAT DON'T WORK
DeanKamen_2009P@45.21:53.14 AND IT TURNS OUT THAT WITH SIXTY MINUTES CAMERAS ROLLING IN THE BACKGROUND AFTER HE PRETTY MUCH MADE HIS POSITION CLEAR ON THIS HE HAD HIS HOOK AND HE HAD HIS
DeanKamen_2009P@63.49:69.53 IT'S THE FIRST TIME HE 'S FELT LIKE HE 'S HAD AN ARM IN THIRTY NINE YEARS BUT THAT WOULD SORT OF BE JUMPING TO THE MIDDLE OF THE STORY
DeanKamen_2009P@70.78:77.96 AND I'M NOT GOING TO SHOW YOU THAT POLISHED VIDEO I'M GOING TO INSTEAD IN A MINUTE OR TWO SHOW YOU AN EARLY CRUDE VIDEO BECAUSE
DeanKamen_2009P@83.87:86.79 FEW YEARS AGO I WAS VISITED BY THE GUY THAT RUNS DARPA
DeanKamen_2009P@88.07:90.57 PEOPLE THAT FUND ALL THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES THAT
DeanKamen_2009P@97.30:100.43 THEY HAVE A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN ONES THAT WILL HELP OUR SOLDIERS
DeanKamen_2009P@102.00:105.99 I GET THIS SORT OF UNREQUESTED BY ME ANYWAY VISIT
DeanKamen_2009P@110.67:113.07 FROM THE MILITARY AND THE GUY THAT RUNS DARPA
DeanKamen_2009P@124.18:130.72 THE MOST REMOTE PLACES THAT WE PUT SOLDIERS HILLS OF AFGHANISTAN IRAQ
DeanKamen_2009P@131.29:132.83 THEY WERE QUITE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT
DeanKamen_2009P@149.67:151.57 CAR ACCIDENT IN A MAJOR CITY IN THE UNITED STATES
DeanKamen_2009P@161.45:163.34 PART OF THE FACE IT'S PROBABLY NOT COMING BACK
DeanKamen_2009P@164.81:171.68 SO THEY STARTED GIVING ME THE STATISTICS ON HOW MANY OF THESE KIDS HAD LOST AN ARM AND THEN THE SURGEON POINTED OUT WITH A LOT OF ANGER
DeanKamen_2009P@173.95:178.36 AT THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR THEY WERE SHOOTING EACH OTHER WITH MUSKETS IF SOMEBODY LOST AN ARM
DeanKamen_2009P@179.21:181.23 WE GAVE THEM A WOODEN STICK WITH A HOOK ON IT
DeanKamen_2009P@187.60:189.69 WE GIVE THEM A PLASTIC STICK WITH A HOOK ON IT
DeanKamen_2009P@191.01:193.27 AND THEY BASICALLY SAID THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE
DeanKamen_2009P@194.30:200.10 AND THEN THE PUNCHLINE SO DEAN WE'RE HERE BECAUSE YOU MAKE MEDICAL STUFF YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE US AN ARM
DeanKamen_2009P@201.21:205.99 AND I WAS WAITING FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED PAGES OF BUREAUCRACY AND PAPERWORK AND

DeanKamen_2009P@254.46:256.72 BE COMPLETELY SELF CONTAINED INCLUDING ALL ITS POWER
DeanKamen_2009P@258.45:261.98 SO THEY FINISHED THAT AND I AS YOU CAN TELL AM A BASHFUL GUY
DeanKamen_2009P@262.89:263.70 I TOLD THEM THEY'RE
DeanKamen_2009P@272.16:275.38 THE SURGEON SAYS TO ME DEAN YOU NEED TO KNOW
DeanKamen_2009P@276.51:278.52 MORE THAN TWO DOZEN OF THESE KIDS HAVE COME BACK
DeanKamen_2009P@282.17:284.79 I CAN NOT IMAGINE I'M SORRY YOU MAY HAVE
DeanKamen_2009P@295.98:299.20 BUT COMPARED TO THAT LOSING TWO SEEMS LIKE
DeanKamen_2009P@299.80:301.16 WOULD BE AN INCONVENIENCE
DeanKamen_2009P@302.95:306.91 ANYWAY I WENT HOME THAT NIGHT I THOUGHT ABOUT IT I LITERALLY COULD NOT SLEEP
DeanKamen_2009P@307.61:307.77 I
DeanKamen_2009P@313.49:315.29 SO I DECIDED WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS

DeanKamen_2009P@326.36:326.79 BUT I
DeanKamen_2009P@330.93:332.24 DID A LITTLE INVESTIGATION
DeanKamen_2009P@336.04:336.89 I STILL THINK THEY'RE
DeanKamen_2009P@348.36:349.86 WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE THINGS LIKE

DeanKamen_2009P@358.92:361.48 THAT'S UNDER NINE POUNDS THAT HAS ALL THAT CAPABILITY
DeanKamen_2009P@362.52:364.96 WILL TAKE THE OTHER NINE TO MAKE IT FUNCTIONAL AND USEFUL
DeanKamen_2009P@366.98:375.87 AGREED TO DISAGREE I WENT BACK AND I STARTED PUTTING THE TEAM TOGETHER THE BEST GUYS I COULD FIND WITH A PASSION TO DO THIS AT THE END OF EXACTLY ONE YEAR
DeanKamen_2009P@376.49:382.07 WE HAD A DEVICE WITH FOURTEEN DEGREES OF FREEDOM ALL THE SENSORS ALL THE MICROPROCESSORS ALL THE STUFF INSIDE
DeanKamen_2009P@383.12:388.74 I COULD SHOW YOU IT WITH A COSMESIS ON IT THAT'S SO REAL IT'S EERIE BUT THEN YOU WOULDN'T SEE ALL THIS COOL STUFF
DeanKamen_2009P@398.61:402.70 I THINK YOU COULD SEE IN AIMEE 'S CAPABILITIES AND ATTITUDES
DeanKamen_2009P@403.35:405.59 PEOPLE WITH A DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING
DeanKamen_2009P@406.24:408.70 ARE QUITE REMARKABLE AND NATURE IS QUITE
DeanKamen_2009P@418.91:426.54 LITERALLY HE 'S GOT NO SHOULDER ON ONE SIDE AND IT HIGH TRANS HUMERAL ON THE OTHER AND THAT'S CHUCK AND RANDY TOGETHER
DeanKamen_2009P@428.94:439.55 AFTER TEN HOURS WERE PLAYING IN OUR OFFICE AND WE TOOK SOME PRETTY CRUDDY HOME MOVIES AT THE END OF THE ONE I'M GOING TO SHOW IT'S ONLY ABOUT A MINUTE AND A COUPLE OF SECONDS LONG
DeanKamen_2009P@442.77:446.20 CHUCK DOES SOMETHING THAT TO THIS DAY I'M JEALOUS OF I CAN'T DO IT
DeanKamen_2009P@447.15:449.00 HE PICKS UP A SPOON PICKS IT UP
DeanKamen_2009P@449.98:451.96 SCOOPS OUT SOME SHREDDED WHEAT
DeanKamen_2009P@462.43:463.53 I CAN NOT DO THAT
DeanKamen_2009P@467.01:472.08 HIS WIFE WAS STANDING BEHIND ME SHE'S STANDING BEHIND ME AT THE TIME AND SHE SAYS DEAN
DeanKamen_2009P@473.80:476.67 CHUCK HASN'T FED HIMSELF IN NINETEEN YEARS
DeanKamen_2009P@477.55:480.03 SO YOU'VE GOT A CHOICE WE KEEP THE ARM

DeanKamen_2009P@512.19:514.02 AND JUST AS IN THE SPIRIT OF
DeanKamen_2009P@515.16:518.92 FIRST GRACIOUS PROFESSIONALISM THEY ARE QUITE PROUD OF THIS SO THEY DECIDE TO SHARE
DeanKamen_2009P@521.02:526.38 THIS IS A NON TRIVIAL THING TO DO BY THE WAY IMAGINE DOING THAT WITH A WOODEN STICK AND A HOOK ON THE END OF IT DOING
DeanKamen_2009P@528.83:533.97 NOW CHUCK IS DOING SOMETHING QUITE EXTRAORDINARY AT LEAST FOR MY LIMITED PHYSICAL SKILL
DeanKamen_2009P@536.56:542.81 AND NOW HE 'S GOING TO DO WHAT DARPA ASKED ME FOR HE 'S GOING TO PICK UP A GRAPE HE DIDN'T DROP IT HE DIDN'T BREAK IT
