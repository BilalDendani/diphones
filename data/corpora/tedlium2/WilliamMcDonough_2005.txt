WilliamMcDonough_2005 SIXTY TWO WITH RACHEL CARSON 'S SILENT SPRING I THINK FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME IN THE WORLD OF THE MAKING OF THINGS
WilliamMcDonough_2005 THE CANARY IN THE MINE WASN'T SINGING AND SO THE QUESTION THAT WE MIGHT NOT HAVE BIRDS
WilliamMcDonough_2005 BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE JUST COME FROM THIS DISCUSSION OF WHAT A BIRD MIGHT BE WHAT IS A BIRD WELL IN MY WORLD THIS IS A RUBBER DUCK
WilliamMcDonough_2005 COMES IN CALIFORNIA WITH A WARNING THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS CHEMICALS KNOWN BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER AND BIRTH DEFECTS OR OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HARM
WilliamMcDonough_2005 THIS IS A BIRD
WilliamMcDonough_2005 WHAT KIND OF CULTURE WOULD PRODUCE A PRODUCT OF THIS KIND AND THEN LABEL IT AND SELL IT TO CHILDREN
WilliamMcDonough_2005 WE HAVE A DESIGN PROBLEM SOMEONE HEARD THE SIX HOURS OF TALK THAT I GAVE
WilliamMcDonough_2005 WAS A NICE THING TO GET THAT WAS ONE SENTENCE
WilliamMcDonough_2005 AND WHAT WOULD OUR INTENTIONS BE IF WE WAKE UP IN THE MORNING WE HAVE DESIGNS ON THE WORLD WELL WHAT WOULD OUR INTENTION BE AS A SPECIES NOW THAT WE'RE THE DOMINANT SPECIES AND IT'S NOT JUST STEWARDSHIP AND DOMINION DEBATE BECAUSE REALLY DOMINION IS
WilliamMcDonough_2005 IMPLICIT IN STEWARDSHIP BECAUSE HOW COULD YOU DOMINATE SOMETHING YOU HAD KILLED AND STEWARDSHIP 'S IMPLICIT IN DOMINION BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BE STEWARD OF SOMETHING IF YOU CAN'T DOMINATE IT SO
WilliamMcDonough_2005 THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE FIRST QUESTION FOR DESIGNERS NOW AS GUARDIANS LET 'S SAY THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE WHICH RESERVES THE RIGHT TO KILL THE RIGHT TO BE DUPLICITOUS
WilliamMcDonough_2005 AND SO ON THE QUESTION WE'RE ASKING THE GUARDIAN AT THIS POINT IS ARE WE MEANT HOW ARE WE MEANT TO SECURE LOCAL SOCIETIES CREATE WORLD
WilliamMcDonough_2005 SO WE USE THE TOOLS OF COMMERCE PRIMARILY FOR OUR WORK BUT THE QUESTION WE BRING TO IT IS HOW DO WE LOVE ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL SPECIES
WilliamMcDonough_2005 FOR ALL TIME AND SO WE START OUR DESIGNS WITH THAT QUESTION BECAUSE WHAT WE REALIZE TODAY IS THAT MODERN CULTURE APPEARS TO HAVE ADOPTED A STRATEGY OF TRAGEDY
WilliamMcDonough_2005 IF WE COME HERE AND SAY WELL I DIDN'T INTEND TO CAUSE GLOBAL WARMING ON THE WAY HERE AND WE SAY THAT 'S NOT PART OF MY PLAN THEN WE REALIZE IT'S PART OF OUR DE FACTO PLAN BECAUSE IT'S THE THING THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE WE HAVE NO OTHER
WilliamMcDonough_2005 AND I WAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE FOR PRESIDENT BUSH MEETING WITH EVERY FEDERAL DEPARTMENT AND AGENCY AND I POINTED OUT THAT THEY APPEAR TO HAVE NO PLAN IF THE END GAME IS GLOBAL WARMING THEY'RE DOING GREAT
WilliamMcDonough_2005 IF THE END GAME IS MERCURY TOXIFICATION OF OUR CHILDREN DOWNWIND OF COAL FIRE PLANTS AS THEY SCUTTLED THE CLEAN AIR ACT THEN I SEE THAT OUR EDUCATION PROGRAMS SHOULD BE EXPLICITLY DEFINED AS BRAIN DEATH FOR ALL CHILDREN NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND
WilliamMcDonough_2005 THE QUESTION IS HOW MANY FEDERAL OFFICIALS ARE READY TO MOVE TO OHIO AND PENNSYLVANIA WITH THEIR FAMILIES SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN ENDGAME OF SOMETHING DELIGHTFUL THEN YOU'RE JUST MOVING CHESS PIECES AROUND IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOU'RE TAKING THE KING SO
WilliamMcDonough_2005 ANYBODY HERE HAS TROUBLE WITH THE CONCEPT OF DESIGN HUMILITY REFLECT ON THIS IT TOOK US FIVE THOUSAND YEARS TO PUT WHEELS ON OUR LUGGAGE
WilliamMcDonough_2005 SO
WilliamMcDonough_2005 AS KEVIN KELLY POINTED OUT THERE IS NO ENDGAME THERE IS AN INFINITE GAME AND WE'RE PLAYING IN THAT INFINITE GAME AND SO WE CALL IT CRADLE TO CRADLE
WilliamMcDonough_2005 AND OUR GOAL IS VERY SIMPLE THIS IS WHAT I PRESENTED TO THE WHITE HOUSE OUR GOAL IS A DELIGHTFULLY DIVERSE SAFE HEALTHY AND JUST WORLD WITH CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER SOIL
WilliamMcDonough_2005 POWER ECONOMICALLY EQUITABLY ECOLOGICALLY AND ELEGANTLY ENJOYED PERIOD
WilliamMcDonough_2005 WAS LIKE TO BE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE HE SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S LIKE TRYING TO RUN A COUNTRY WITH FOUR HUNDRED KINDS OF CHEESE
WilliamMcDonough_2005 THE SAME TIME WE REALIZE THAT OUR PRODUCTS ARE NOT SAFE AND HEALTHY SO WE'VE DESIGNED PRODUCTS AND WE ANALYZED CHEMICALS DOWN TO THE PARTS PER MILLION THIS IS A BABY BLANKET BY PENDLETON THAT
WilliamMcDonough_2005 AND AT WHAT POINT DID THAT UNIFORM TURN FROM WHITE TO BLACK
WilliamMcDonough_2005 A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE THAT'S NOT BEING ADDRESSED WE'VE SEEN THE FIRST FORM OF SOLAR ENERGY THAT'S BEAT THE HEGEMONY OF FOSSIL FUELS IN THE FORM OF WIND HERE IN THE GREAT PLAINS AND SO THAT HEGEMONY IS LEAVING
WilliamMcDonough_2005 AND IF WE REMEMBER SHEIKH YAMANI WHEN HE FORMED OPEC THEY ASKED HIM WHEN WILL WE SEE THE END OF THE
WilliamMcDonough_2005 OIL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER HIS ANSWER BUT IT WAS THE STONE AGE DIDN'T END BECAUSE WE RAN OUT OF STONES
WilliamMcDonough_2005 WE SEE THAT COMPANIES ACTING ETHICALLY IN THIS WORLD ARE OUTPERFORMING THOSE THAT DON 'T WE SEE THE FLOWS OF MATERIALS
WilliamMcDonough_2005 IN A RATHER TERRIFYING PROSPECT THIS IS A HOSPITAL MONITOR FROM LOS ANGELES SENT TO CHINA THIS WOMAN WILL EXPOSE HERSELF TO TOXIC PHOSPHOROUS
WilliamMcDonough_2005 FOUR POUNDS OF TOXIC LEAD INTO HER CHILDRENS ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS FROM COPPER ON THE OTHER HAND WE SEE GREAT SIGNS OF HOPE HERE 'S DOCTOR VENKATASWAMY IN INDIA WHO 'S FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO MASS PRODUCED HEALTH HE HAS GIVEN EYESIGHT TO TWO MILLION PEOPLE FOR FREE
WilliamMcDonough_2005 WE SEE IN OUR MATERIAL FLOWS THAT CAR STEELS DON'T BECOME CAR STEEL AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE CONTAMINANTS OF THE COATINGS BISMUTH ANTIMONY COPPER AND SO ON THEY BECOME BUILDING STEEL
WilliamMcDonough_2005 WE'RE WORKING WITH BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY WARREN BUFFETT AND SHAW CARPET THE LARGEST CARPET COMPANY IN THE WORLD WE'VE DEVELOPED A CARPET THAT IS CONTINUOUSLY RECYCLABLE DOWN TO THE PARTS PER
WilliamMcDonough_2005 MILLION THE UPPER IS NYLON SIX THAT CAN GO BACK TO CAPROLACTAM THE BOTTOM A POLYOLEPHINE INFINITELY RECYCLABLE THERMOPLASTIC NOW IF I WAS A BIRD THE BUILDING ON MY LEFT IS A LIABILITY
WilliamMcDonough_2005 THE BUILDING ON MY RIGHT WHICH IS OUR CORPORATE CAMPUS FOR THE GAP WITH AN ANCIENT MEADOW IS AN ASSET ITS NESTING GROUNDS
WilliamMcDonough_2005 'S WHERE I COME FROM I GREW UP IN HONG KONG WITH SIX MILLION PEOPLE IN FORTY SQUARE MILES DURING THE DRY SEASON WE HAD FOUR HOURS OF WATER EVERY FOURTH DAY AND THE RELATIONSHIP TO LANDSCAPE
WilliamMcDonough_2005 MY CHILDHOOD SUMMERS WERE IN THE PUGET SOUND OF WASHINGTON AMONG THE FIRST GROWTH AND BIG GROWTH MY GRANDFATHER HAD BEEN A LUMBERJACK IN THE OLYMPICS SO I HAVE A LOT OF TREE KARMA I AM WORKING OFF
WilliamMcDonough_2005 I WENT TO YALE FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL STUDIED IN A BUILDING OF THIS STYLE BY LE CORBUSIER AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN IN OUR BUSINESS AS BRUTALISM
WilliamMcDonough_2005 AND THE WINDOWS ARE ALL CLOSED AND WITH MOST PRODUCTS APPEARING NOT TO HAVE BEEN DESIGNED FOR INDOOR USE THIS IS ACTUALLY A VERTICAL GAS CHAMBER
WilliamMcDonough_2005 AND RICHARD MEIERS WHO WAS ONE OF MY TEACHERS KEPT COMING OVER TO MY DESK TO GIVE ME CRITICISM AND HE WOULD SAY BILL YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND SOLAR ENERGY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ARCHITECTURE
WilliamMcDonough_2005 AND YET NOAA HAS NOW SHOWN US FOR EXAMPLE YOU SEE THAT LITTLE BLUE THING ABOVE HAWAII THAT'S THE PACIFIC GYRE IT WAS RECENTLY DRAGGED FOR PLANKTON BY SCIENTISTS AND THEY FOUND SIX TIMES AS MUCH
WilliamMcDonough_2005 AS PLANKTON WHEN ASKED THEY SAID IT 'S KIND OF LIKE A GIANT TOILET THAT DOESN'T FLUSH
WilliamMcDonough_2005 IT IS NOT A TREE THAT'S THE NAME OF THE FIRST CHAPTER THIS BOOK IS NOT A TREE BECAUSE IN POETICS AS MARGARET ATWOOD POINTED OUT WE WRITE OUR HISTORY ON THE SKIN OF FISH WITH THE BLOOD OF BEARS
WilliamMcDonough_2005 AND WITH SO MUCH POLYMER WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS TECHNICAL NUTRITION AND TO USE SOMETHING AS ELEGANT AS A TREE IMAGINE THIS DESIGN ASSIGNMENT DESIGN SOMETHING THAT MAKES OXYGEN SEQUESTERS CARBON FIXES NITROGEN
WilliamMcDonough_2005 SO
WilliamMcDonough_2005 THE SAME CRITERIA AS MOST PEOPLE YOU KNOW CAN I AFFORD IT DOES IT WORK DO I LIKE IT WE'RE ADDING THE JEFFERSONIAN AGENDA AND I COME FROM CHARLOTTESVILLE WHERE I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF LIVING IN A HOUSE DESIGNED BY THOMAS JEFFERSON WE'RE ADDING LIFE
WilliamMcDonough_2005 LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS
WilliamMcDonough_2005 NOW IF WE LOOK AT THE WORD COMPETITION I'M SURE MOST OF YOU'VE USED IT YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IT COMES FROM THE LATIN COMPETERE WHICH MEANS STRIVE TOGETHER IT MEANS THE WAY OLYMPIC ATHLETES TRAIN WITH EACH OTHER THEY GET FIT TOGETHER AND THEN THEY COMPETE THE WILLIAMS SISTERS COMPETE ONE WINS WIMBLEDON
WilliamMcDonough_2005 SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE IDEA OF COMPETITION AS A WAY OF COOPERATING IN ORDER TO GET FIT TOGETHER AND THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS NOW I WORK WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT NOW HAS TAKEN
WilliamMcDonough_2005 WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST NOT IN JUST COMPETITION TERMS IN OUR MODERN CONTEXT OF DESTROY THE OTHER OR BEAT THEM TO THE GROUND BUT REALLY TO FIT TOGETHER AND BUILD NICHES AND HAVE GROWTH
WilliamMcDonough_2005 THAT IS GOOD NOW MOST ENVIRONMENTALISTS DON'T SAY GROWTH IS GOOD BECAUSE IN OUR LEXICON ASPHALT IS TWO WORDS ASSIGNING A BLAME
WilliamMcDonough_2005 BUT IF WE LOOK AT ASPHALT AS OUR GROWTH THEN WE REALIZE THAT ALL WE'RE DOING IS DESTROYING THE PLANETARY 'S FUNDAMENTAL UNDERLYING OPERATING SYSTEM SO WHEN WE SEE E EQUALS MC SQUARED COME ALONG
WilliamMcDonough_2005 FROM A POET 'S PERSPECTIVE WE SEE ENERGY AS PHYSICS CHEMISTRY AS MASS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GET THIS BIOLOGY AND WE HAVE PLENTY OF ENERGY SO WE'LL SOLVE THAT PROBLEM BUT THE BIOLOGY PROBLEM 'S TRICKY BECAUSE AS WE
WilliamMcDonough_2005 PUT THROUGH ALL THESE TOXIC MATERIALS THAT WE DISGORGE WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO RECOVER THAT AND AS FRANCIS CRICK POINTED OUT NINE YEARS AFTER DISCOVERING DNA WITH MISTER WATSON
WilliamMcDonough_2005 THAT LIFE ITSELF HAS TO HAVE GROWTH AS A PRECONDITION IT HAS TO HAVE FREE ENERGY SUNLIGHT AND IT NEEDS TO BE AN OPEN SYSTEM OF CHEMICALS
WilliamMcDonough_2005 SO WE'RE ASKING FOR HUMAN ARTIFICE TO BECOME A LIVING THING AND WE WANT GROWTH WE WANT FREE ENERGY FROM SUNLIGHT AND WE WANT AN OPEN METABOLISM FOR CHEMICALS THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES NOT GROWTH OR NO GROWTH BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT TO GROW
WilliamMcDonough_2005 SO THEREFORE WE HAVE THESE TWO METABOLISMS AND I WORKED WITH A GERMAN CHEMIST MICHAEL BRAUNGART AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED THE TWO FUNDAMENTAL METABOLISMS THE BIOLOGICAL ONE I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND
WilliamMcDonough_2005 BUT ALSO THE TECHNICAL ONE WHERE WE TAKE MATERIALS AND PUT THEM INTO CLOSED CYCLES WE CALL THEM BIOLOGICAL NUTRITION AND TECHNICAL NUTRITION TECHNICAL NUTRITION WILL BE IN AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF BIOLOGICAL NUTRITION BIOLOGICAL NUTRITION CAN SUPPLY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION HUMANS
WilliamMcDonough_2005 WHICH MEANS THAT IF WE ALL WORE BIRKENSTOCKS AND COTTON THE WORLD WOULD RUN OUT OF CORK AND DRY UP SO WE NEED MATERIALS IN CLOSED CYCLES BUT WE NEED TO ANALYZE THEM DOWN TO THE PARTS PER MILLION FOR CANCER BIRTH DEFECTS MUTAGENIC EFFECTS DISRUPTION OF OUR IMMUNE SYSTEMS BIODEGRADATION
WilliamMcDonough_2005 OUR FIRST PRODUCT WAS A TEXTILE WHERE WE ANALYZED EIGHT THOUSAND CHEMICALS IN THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY USING THOSE INTELLECTUAL FILTERS WE ELIMINATED NINE THOUSAND SEVEN
WilliamMcDonough_2005 SIXTY TWO WE WERE LEFT WITH THIRTY EIGHT CHEMICALS WE HAVE SINCE DATABASED THE FOUR THOUSAND MOST COMMONLY USED CHEMICALS IN HUMAN MANUFACTURING
WilliamMcDonough_2005 AND WE'RE RELEASING THIS DATABASE INTO THE PUBLIC IN SIX WEEKS SO DESIGNERS ALL OVER THE WORLD CAN ANALYZE THEIR PRODUCTS DOWN TO THE PARTS PER MILLION FOR HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTH
WilliamMcDonough_2005 SO THAT COMPANIES CAN SEND THESE SAME MESSAGES ALL THE WAY THROUGH THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS BECAUSE WHEN WE ASKED MOST COMPANIES WE WORK WITH ABOUT A TRILLION DOLLARS
WilliamMcDonough_2005 COME FROM THEY SAY SUPPLIERS AND WHERE DOES IT GO CUSTOMERS SO WE NEED SOME HELP THERE SO THE BIOLOGICAL NUTRIENTS THE FIRST FABRICS THE WATER COMING OUT WAS CLEAN ENOUGH TO DRINK
WilliamMcDonough_2005 IT'S ALL SOLAR POWERED HERE 'S A BUILDING AT OBERLIN COLLEGE WE DESIGNED THAT MAKES MORE ENERGY THAN IT NEEDS TO OPERATE AND PURIFIES ITS OWN WATER HERE 'S A BUILDING FOR THE GAP
WilliamMcDonough_2005 WHERE THE ANCIENT GRASSES OF SAN BRUNO CALIFORNIA ARE ON THE ROOF AND THIS IS OUR PROJECT FOR FORD MOTOR COMPANY IT'S THE REVITALIZATION OF THE RIVER ROUGE IN DEARBORN THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A COLOR PHOTOGRAPH
WilliamMcDonough_2005 THESE ARE OUR TOOLS THESE ARE HOW WE SOLD IT TO FORD WE SAVED FORD THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS DOING IT THIS WAY
WilliamMcDonough_2005 DAY ONE WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT OF THE FORD TAURUS AT A FOUR PERCENT MARGIN OF AN ORDER FOR NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CARS HERE IT IS IT'S THE WORLD 'S LARGEST GREEN ROOF TEN AND A HALF ACRES THIS IS THE ROOF
WilliamMcDonough_2005 WE'RE DEVELOPING NOW PROTOCOLS FOR CITIES THAT'S THE HOME OF TECHNICAL NUTRIENTS THE COUNTRY THE HOME OF BIOLOGICAL AND PUTTING THEM TOGETHER AND SO I WILL FINISH BY SHOWING YOU A NEW CITY WE'RE DESIGNING FOR THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WE'RE DOING TWELVE CITIES FOR CHINA
WilliamMcDonough_2005 RIGHT NOW BASED ON CRADLE TO CRADLE AS TEMPLATES OUR ASSIGNMENT IS TO DEVELOP PROTOCOLS FOR THE HOUSING FOR FOUR HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE IN TWELVE YEARS WE DID A MASS ENERGY BALANCE IF THEY USE BRICK THEY WILL LOSE ALL THEIR SOIL AND
WilliamMcDonough_2005 HAVE CITIES WITH NO ENERGY AND NO FOOD WE SIGNED A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING HERE 'S MADAM DENG LAN DENG XIAOPING 'S DAUGHTER FOR CHINA TO ADOPT CRADLE TO CRADLE BECAUSE IF THEY TOXIFY THEMSELVES BEING THE LOWEST COST PRODUCER
WilliamMcDonough_2005 SEND IT TO THE LOWEST COST DISTRIBUTION WAL MART AND THEN WE SEND THEM ALL OUR MONEY WHAT WE'LL DISCOVER IS THAT WE HAVE WHAT EFFECTIVELY WHEN I WAS A STUDENT
WilliamMcDonough_2005 WAS CALLED MUTUALLY SHARED DESTRUCTION NOW WE DO IT BY MOLECULE THESE ARE OUR CITIES WE'RE BUILDING A NEW CITY NEXT TO THIS CITY LOOK AT THAT LANDSCAPE
WilliamMcDonough_2005 THIS IS THE SITE
WilliamMcDonough_2005 WE DON'T NORMALLY DO GREEN FIELDS BUT THIS ONE IS ABOUT TO BE BUILT SO THEY BROUGHT US IN TO INTERCEDE THIS IS THEIR PLAN IT'S A RUBBER STAMP GRID THAT THEY LAID RIGHT ON THAT LANDSCAPE AND THEY BROUGHT US IN AND SAID WHAT WOULD YOU DO
WilliamMcDonough_2005 THIS IS WHAT THEY WOULD END UP WITH WHICH IS ANOTHER COLOR PHOTOGRAPH SO THIS IS THE EXISTING SITE SO THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE NOW AND HERE 'S OUR PROPOSAL
WilliamMcDonough_2005 SO THE WAY WE APPROACHED THIS IS WE STUDIED THE HYDROLOGY VERY CAREFULLY WE STUDIED THE BIOTA THE ANCIENT BIOTA THE CURRENT FARMING AND THE PROTOCOLS WE STUDIED THE WINDS AND THE SUN TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IN THE CITY
WilliamMcDonough_2005 HAVE FRESH AIR FRESH WATER AND DIRECT SUNLIGHT IN EVERY SINGLE APARTMENT AT SOME POINT DURING THE DAY WE THEN TAKE THE PARKS AND LAY THEM OUT AS ECOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WE LAY OUT THE BUILDING AREAS
WilliamMcDonough_2005 WE START TO INTEGRATE COMMERCIAL AND MIXED USE SO THE PEOPLE ALL HAVE CENTERS AND PLACES TO BE THE TRANSPORTATION IS ALL VERY SIMPLE EVERYBODY 'S WITHIN A FIVE MINUTE WALK OF MOBILITY
WilliamMcDonough_2005 WE HAVE A TWENTY FOUR HOUR STREET SO THAT THERE'S ALWAYS A PLACE THAT'S ALIVE THE WASTE SYSTEMS ALL CONNECT IF YOU FLUSH A TOILET
WilliamMcDonough_2005 YOUR FECES WILL GO TO THE SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANTS WHICH ARE SOLD AS ASSETS NOT LIABILITIES BECAUSE WHO WANTS THE FERTILIZER FACTORY THAT MAKES NATURAL GAS
WilliamMcDonough_2005 THE WATERS ARE ALL TAKEN IN TO CONSTRUCT THE WETLANDS FOR HABITAT RESTORATIONS AND THEN IT MAKES
WilliamMcDonough_2005 NATURAL GAS WHICH THEN GOES BACK INTO THE CITY TO POWER THE FUEL FOR THE COOKING
WilliamMcDonough_2005 THE CITY SO THIS IS THESE ARE FERTILIZER GAS PLANTS AND THEN THE COMPOST IS ALL TAKEN BACK TO THE ROOFS OF THE CITY WHERE WE'VE GOT FARMING BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE LIFTED UP THE CITY
WilliamMcDonough_2005 THE LANDSCAPE INTO THE AIR TO
WilliamMcDonough_2005 TO RESTORE THE NATIVE LANDSCAPE ON THE ROOFS OF THE BUILDINGS THE SOLAR POWER OF ALL THE FACTORY CENTERS AND ALL THE INDUSTRIAL ZONES WITH THEIR LIGHT ROOFS POWERS
WilliamMcDonough_2005 AND THIS IS THE CONCEPT FOR THE TOP OF THE CITY WE'VE LIFTED THE EARTH UP ONTO THE ROOFS THE FARMERS HAVE LITTLE BRIDGES TO GET FROM ONE ROOF TO THE NEXT
WilliamMcDonough_2005 WE INHABIT THE CITY WITH WORK LIVE SPACE ON ALL THE GROUND FLOORS AND SO THIS IS THE EXISTING CITY AND THIS IS THE NEW CITY
