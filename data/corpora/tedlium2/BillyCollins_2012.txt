BillyCollins_2012 GIVE YOU YOUR RECOMMENDED
BillyCollins_2012 DIETARY ALLOWANCE OF POETRY
BillyCollins_2012 AND THE WAY I 'M GOING TO DO THAT IS PRESENT TO YOU
BillyCollins_2012 FIVE ANIMATIONS OF FIVE OF MY POEMS AND LET ME JUST TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT OF HOW THAT CAME ABOUT BECAUSE THE MIXING OF THOSE TWO MEDIA IS A SORT OF UNNATURAL OR UNNECESSARY ACT BUT WHEN I WAS UNITED STATES POET LAUREATE
BillyCollins_2012 AND I LOVE SAYING THAT
BillyCollins_2012 WHEN I WAS HIM BACK THEN I WAS APPROACHED BY J WALTER THOMPSON THE AD COMPANY AND THEY WERE HIRED
BillyCollins_2012 SORT OF BY THE SUNDANCE CHANNEL AND THE IDEA WAS TO HAVE ME RECORD SOME OF MY POEMS AND THEN THEY WOULD FIND ANIMATORS TO ANIMATE THEM AND I WAS INITIALLY RESISTANT BECAUSE I ALWAYS THINK POETRY CAN STAND ALONE BY ITSELF
BillyCollins_2012 ATTEMPTS TO PUT MY POEMS TO MUSIC HAVE HAD DISASTROUS RESULTS IN ALL CASES AND THE POEM IF IT 'S WRITTEN WITH THE EAR ALREADY HAS BEEN SET TO ITS OWN VERBAL MUSIC AS IT WAS COMPOSED
BillyCollins_2012 AND SURELY IF YOU 'RE READING A POEM THAT MENTIONS A COW YOU DON 'T NEED ON THE FACING PAGE A DRAWING OF A COW I MEAN LET 'S LET THE READER DO A LITTLE WORK
BillyCollins_2012 BUT I RELENTED BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE AN INTERESTING POSSIBILITY AND ALSO I 'M LIKE A TOTAL CARTOON JUNKIE SINCE CHILDHOOD
BillyCollins_2012 I THINK MORE INFLUENTIAL THAN EMILY DICKINSON OR COLERIDGE OR WORDSWORTH ON MY IMAGINATION WERE WARNER BROTHERS

BillyCollins_2012 THAT WERE INSTALLED IN HIGH SCHOOL
BillyCollins_2012 SO LET US START WITH THE FIRST ONE IT 'S A LITTLE POEM CALLED BUDAPEST AND IN IT I REVEAL OR PRETEND TO REVEAL THE SECRETS OF THE CREATIVE
BillyCollins_2012 PROCESS VIDEO NARRATION BUDAPEST
BillyCollins_2012 MY PEN MOVES ALONG THE PAGE LIKE THE SNOUT OF A STRANGE ANIMAL SHAPED LIKE A HUMAN ARM AND DRESSED IN THE SLEEVE OF A LOOSE GREEN SWEATER I WATCH IT SNIFFING THE PAPER CEASELESSLY INTENT AS ANY FORAGER
BillyCollins_2012 IT WANTS ONLY TO BE HERE TOMORROW DRESSED PERHAPS IN THE SLEEVE OF A PLAID SHIRT
BillyCollins_2012 NOSE PRESSED AGAINST THE PAGE WRITING A FEW MORE DUTIFUL LINES WHILE I GAZE OUT THE WINDOW AND IMAGINE BUDAPEST OR SOME OTHER CITY WHERE I HAVE NEVER BEEN
BillyCollins_2012 SHE SAID YOU KNOW POETRY IS HARDER THAN WRITING WHICH I FOUND BOTH ERRONEOUS AND PROFOUND
BillyCollins_2012 LEGS AT THE KNEES IF THEY COME WITH THAT FEATURE AND FIX THEM INTO THE TINY WOODEN CHAIRS

BillyCollins_2012 THE DEAD ARE ALWAYS LOOKING DOWN ON US THEY SAY
BillyCollins_2012 AND WHEN WE LIE DOWN IN A FIELD OR ON A COUCH
BillyCollins_2012 DRUGGED PERHAPS BY THE HUM OF A WARM AFTERNOON THEY THINK WE ARE LOOKING BACK AT THEM WHICH MAKES THEM LIFT THEIR OARS AND FALL SILENT AND WAIT LIKE PARENTS FOR US TO CLOSE OUR EYES
