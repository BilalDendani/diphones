BillyCollins_2012@13.45:15.73 GIVE YOU YOUR RECOMMENDED
BillyCollins_2012@15.75:17.91 DIETARY ALLOWANCE OF POETRY
BillyCollins_2012@18.97:21.93 AND THE WAY I 'M GOING TO DO THAT IS PRESENT TO YOU
BillyCollins_2012@22.07:36.95 FIVE ANIMATIONS OF FIVE OF MY POEMS AND LET ME JUST TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT OF HOW THAT CAME ABOUT BECAUSE THE MIXING OF THOSE TWO MEDIA IS A SORT OF UNNATURAL OR UNNECESSARY ACT BUT WHEN I WAS UNITED STATES POET LAUREATE
BillyCollins_2012@37.49:39.42 AND I LOVE SAYING THAT
BillyCollins_2012@44.67:52.45 WHEN I WAS HIM BACK THEN I WAS APPROACHED BY J WALTER THOMPSON THE AD COMPANY AND THEY WERE HIRED
BillyCollins_2012@52.45:66.5 SORT OF BY THE SUNDANCE CHANNEL AND THE IDEA WAS TO HAVE ME RECORD SOME OF MY POEMS AND THEN THEY WOULD FIND ANIMATORS TO ANIMATE THEM AND I WAS INITIALLY RESISTANT BECAUSE I ALWAYS THINK POETRY CAN STAND ALONE BY ITSELF
BillyCollins_2012@66.5:82.68 ATTEMPTS TO PUT MY POEMS TO MUSIC HAVE HAD DISASTROUS RESULTS IN ALL CASES AND THE POEM IF IT 'S WRITTEN WITH THE EAR ALREADY HAS BEEN SET TO ITS OWN VERBAL MUSIC AS IT WAS COMPOSED
BillyCollins_2012@82.68:93.11 AND SURELY IF YOU 'RE READING A POEM THAT MENTIONS A COW YOU DON 'T NEED ON THE FACING PAGE A DRAWING OF A COW I MEAN LET 'S LET THE READER DO A LITTLE WORK
BillyCollins_2012@93.11:102.4 BUT I RELENTED BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE AN INTERESTING POSSIBILITY AND ALSO I 'M LIKE A TOTAL CARTOON JUNKIE SINCE CHILDHOOD
BillyCollins_2012@102.4:110.96 I THINK MORE INFLUENTIAL THAN EMILY DICKINSON OR COLERIDGE OR WORDSWORTH ON MY IMAGINATION WERE WARNER BROTHERS
BillyCollins_2012@110.96:118.18 MERRIE MELODIES AND LOONY TUNES CARTOONS BUGS BUNNY IS MY MUSE
BillyCollins_2012@142.32:157.06 I CREATED A POETRY CHANNEL ON DELTA AIRLINES THAT LASTED FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS SO YOU COULD TUNE INTO POETRY AS YOU WERE FLYING AND MY SENSE IS IT 'S A GOOD THING TO GET POETRY OFF THE SHELVES AND MORE INTO PUBLIC LIFE
BillyCollins_2012@157.19:173.49 START A MEETING WITH A POEM THAT WOULD BE AN IDEA YOU MIGHT TAKE WITH YOU WHEN YOU GET A POEM ON A BILLBOARD OR ON THE RADIO OR ON A CEREAL BOX OR WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO YOU SO SUDDENLY THAT YOU DON 'T HAVE TIME TO DEPLOY YOUR ANTI POETRY DEFLECTOR SHIELDS
BillyCollins_2012@173.74:175.78 THAT WERE INSTALLED IN HIGH SCHOOL
BillyCollins_2012@178.3:190.36 SO LET US START WITH THE FIRST ONE IT 'S A LITTLE POEM CALLED BUDAPEST AND IN IT I REVEAL OR PRETEND TO REVEAL THE SECRETS OF THE CREATIVE
BillyCollins_2012@190.61:195.08 PROCESS VIDEO NARRATION BUDAPEST
BillyCollins_2012@195.67:213.21 MY PEN MOVES ALONG THE PAGE LIKE THE SNOUT OF A STRANGE ANIMAL SHAPED LIKE A HUMAN ARM AND DRESSED IN THE SLEEVE OF A LOOSE GREEN SWEATER I WATCH IT SNIFFING THE PAPER CEASELESSLY INTENT AS ANY FORAGER
BillyCollins_2012@220.92:228.15 IT WANTS ONLY TO BE HERE TOMORROW DRESSED PERHAPS IN THE SLEEVE OF A PLAID SHIRT
BillyCollins_2012@228.15:241.88 NOSE PRESSED AGAINST THE PAGE WRITING A FEW MORE DUTIFUL LINES WHILE I GAZE OUT THE WINDOW AND IMAGINE BUDAPEST OR SOME OTHER CITY WHERE I HAVE NEVER BEEN
BillyCollins_2012@262.23:269.64 SHE SAID YOU KNOW POETRY IS HARDER THAN WRITING WHICH I FOUND BOTH ERRONEOUS AND PROFOUND
BillyCollins_2012@312.42:318.89 LEGS AT THE KNEES IF THEY COME WITH THAT FEATURE AND FIX THEM INTO THE TINY WOODEN CHAIRS
BillyCollins_2012@319.17:329.24 ALL AFTERNOON THEY FACE ONE ANOTHER THE MAN IN THE BROWN SUIT THE WOMAN IN THE BLUE DRESS PERFECTLY MOTIONLESS PERFECTLY
BillyCollins_2012@334.81:341.39 THEN LOWERED INTO THE DINING ROOM OF A DOLLHOUSE TO SIT WITH THE OTHERS AT THE LONG TABLE
BillyCollins_2012@342.01:348.24 VERY FUNNY BUT HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF YOU NEVER KNEW FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT
BillyCollins_2012@355.81:362.18 OR SITTING DOWN THERE AMIDST THE WALLPAPER STARING STRAIGHT AHEAD
BillyCollins_2012@362.58:364.75 WITH YOUR LITTLE PLASTIC
BillyCollins_2012@382.73:397.54 SLIPPAGE AND THE POEM BEGINS WITH A CERTAIN SPECIES OF FORGETFULNESS THAT SOMEONE CALLED LITERARY AMNESIA IN OTHER WORDS FORGETTING THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE READ
BillyCollins_2012@403.19:411.24 OF THE AUTHOR IS THE FIRST TO GO FOLLOWED OBEDIENTLY BY THE TITLE THE PLOT THE HEARTBREAKING CONCLUSION
