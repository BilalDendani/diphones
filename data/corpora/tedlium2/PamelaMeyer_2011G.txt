PamelaMeyer_2011G BUT IT 'S JUST COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT THE PERSON TO YOUR RIGHT IS A LIAR
PamelaMeyer_2011G ALSO THE PERSON SITTING IN YOUR VERY SEATS IS A LIAR WE 'RE ALL LIARS WHAT I 'M GOING TO DO TODAY IS I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT THE RESEARCH SAYS ABOUT WHY WE 'RE ALL LIARS HOW YOU CAN BECOME A LIESPOTTER AND WHY YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO THE EXTRA MILE AND GO FROM LIESPOTTING TO TRUTH SEEKING
PamelaMeyer_2011G AND ULTIMATELY TO TRUST BUILDING
PamelaMeyer_2011G NOW SPEAKING OF TRUST
PamelaMeyer_2011G EVER SINCE I WROTE THIS BOOK LIESPOTTING NO ONE WANTS TO MEET ME
PamelaMeyer_2011G WHICH IS NOT TO TEACH A GAME OF GOTCHA LIESPOTTERS AREN 'T THOSE NITPICKY KIDS THOSE KIDS IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM THAT ARE SHOUTING GOTCHA GOTCHA YOUR EYEBROW TWITCHED
PamelaMeyer_2011G YOU FLARED YOUR NOSTRIL I WATCH THAT TV SHOW LIE TO ME I KNOW YOU 'RE LYING NO LIESPOTTERS ARE ARMED WITH SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO SPOT DECEPTION THEY USE IT TO GET TO THE TRUTH
PamelaMeyer_2011G AND THEY DO WHAT MATURE LEADERS DO EVERYDAY THEY HAVE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE SOMETIMES DURING VERY DIFFICULT TIMES AND THEY START UP THAT PATH BY ACCEPTING A CORE PROPOSITION AND THAT PROPOSITION IS THE FOLLOWING LYING IS A COOPERATIVE ACT
PamelaMeyer_2011G THINK ABOUT IT A LIE HAS NO POWER WHATSOEVER BY ITS MERE UTTERANCE ITS POWER EMERGES WHEN SOMEONE ELSE AGREES TO BELIEVE THE LIE SO I KNOW IT MAY SOUND LIKE TOUGH LOVE BUT
PamelaMeyer_2011G LOOK IF AT SOME POINT YOU GOT LIED TO IT 'S BECAUSE YOU AGREED TO GET LIED TO TRUTH NUMBER ONE ABOUT LYING LYING 'S A COOPERATIVE ACT NOW NOT ALL LIES ARE HARMFUL SOMETIMES WE 'RE WILLING PARTICIPANTS IN DECEPTION FOR THE SAKE OF SOCIAL DIGNITY
PamelaMeyer_2011G MAYBE TO KEEP A SECRET THAT SHOULD BE KEPT SECRET SECRET WE SAY NICE SONG
PamelaMeyer_2011G BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE ARE UNWILLING PARTICIPANTS IN DECEPTION AND THAT CAN HAVE DRAMATIC COSTS FOR US LAST YEAR SAW NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN CORPORATE FRAUD ALONE IN THE UNITED STATES
PamelaMeyer_2011G THAT 'S AN EYELASH UNDER A TRILLION DOLLARS THAT 'S SEVEN PERCENT OF REVENUES DECEPTION CAN COST BILLIONS THINK ENRON
PamelaMeyer_2011G MADOFF THE MORTGAGE CRISIS
PamelaMeyer_2011G OR IN THE CASE OF DOUBLE AGENTS AND TRAITORS LIKE ROBERT HANSSEN OR ALDRICH AMES LIES CAN BETRAY OUR COUNTRY THEY CAN COMPROMISE OUR SECURITY THEY CAN UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY THEY CAN CAUSE THE DEATHS OF THOSE THAT DEFEND US DECEPTION IS ACTUALLY SERIOUS BUSINESS
PamelaMeyer_2011G THIS CON MAN HENRY OBERLANDER HE WAS SUCH AN EFFECTIVE CON MAN BRITISH AUTHORITIES SAY HE COULD HAVE UNDERMINED THE ENTIRE BANKING SYSTEM OF THE WESTERN WORLD AND YOU CAN 'T FIND THIS GUY ON GOOGLE YOU CAN 'T FIND HIM ANYWHERE HE WAS INTERVIEWED ONCE AND HE SAID THE FOLLOWING HE SAID LOOK I 'VE GOT ONE RULE
PamelaMeyer_2011G AND THIS WAS HENRY 'S RULE HE SAID LOOK
PamelaMeyer_2011G EVERYONE IS WILLING TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING THEY 'RE READY TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING FOR WHATEVER IT IS THEY 'RE HUNGRY FOR
PamelaMeyer_2011G AND THAT 'S THE CRUX OF IT IF YOU DON 'T WANT TO BE DECEIVED YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT IS IT THAT YOU 'RE HUNGRY FOR AND WE ALL KIND OF HATE TO ADMIT IT WE WISH WE WERE BETTER HUSBANDS BETTER WIVES SMARTER MORE POWERFUL TALLER
PamelaMeyer_2011G RICHER THE LIST GOES ON
PamelaMeyer_2011G LYING IS AN ATTEMPT TO BRIDGE THAT GAP TO CONNECT OUR WISHES AND OUR FANTASIES ABOUT WHO WE WISH WE WERE HOW WE WISH WE COULD BE WITH WHAT WE 'RE REALLY LIKE
PamelaMeyer_2011G AND BOY ARE WE WILLING TO FILL IN THOSE GAPS IN OUR LIVES WITH LIES ON A GIVEN DAY STUDIES SHOW THAT YOU MAY BE LIED TO ANYWHERE FROM TEN TO TWO HUNDRED TIMES NOW GRANTED MANY OF THOSE ARE WHITE LIES BUT IN ANOTHER STUDY IT SHOWED THAT STRANGERS LIED THREE TIMES WITHIN THE FIRST TEN MINUTES OF MEETING EACH OTHER
PamelaMeyer_2011G WE CAN 'T BELIEVE HOW PREVALENT LYING IS WE 'RE ESSENTIALLY AGAINST LYING BUT IF YOU LOOK MORE CLOSELY THE PLOT ACTUALLY THICKENS WE LIE MORE TO STRANGERS THAN WE LIE TO COWORKERS
PamelaMeyer_2011G EXTROVERTS LIE MORE THAN INTROVERTS
PamelaMeyer_2011G MEN LIE EIGHT TIMES MORE ABOUT THEMSELVES THAN THEY DO OTHER PEOPLE WOMEN LIE MORE TO PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE
PamelaMeyer_2011G IF YOU 'RE AN AVERAGE MARRIED COUPLE
PamelaMeyer_2011G YOU 'RE GOING TO LIE TO YOUR SPOUSE IN ONE OUT OF EVERY TEN INTERACTIONS NOW YOU MAY THINK THAT 'S BAD IT YOU 'RE UNMARRIED THAT NUMBER DROPS TO THREE
PamelaMeyer_2011G LYING 'S COMPLEX IT 'S WOVEN INTO THE FABRIC OF OUR DAILY AND OUR BUSINESS LIVES WE 'RE DEEPLY AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE TRUTH WE PARSE IT OUT ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS SOMETIMES FOR VERY GOOD REASONS OTHER TIMES JUST BECAUSE WE DON 'T UNDERSTAND THE GAPS IN OUR LIVES
PamelaMeyer_2011G THAT 'S TRUTH NUMBER TWO ABOUT LYING WE 'RE AGAINST LYING BUT WE 'RE COVERTLY FOR IT IN WAYS THAT OUR SOCIETY HAS SANCTIONED FOR CENTURIES AND CENTURIES AND CENTURIES IT 'S AS OLD AS BREATHING IT 'S PART OF OUR CULTURE IT 'S PART OF OUR HISTORY THINK DANTE SHAKESPEARE
PamelaMeyer_2011G ONE YEAR OLDS LEARN CONCEALMENT LAUGHTER TWO YEAR OLDS BLUFF
PamelaMeyer_2011G FIVE YEAR OLDS LIE OUTRIGHT THEY MANIPULATE VIA FLATTERY NINE YEAR OLDS MASTERS OF THE COVER UP BY THE TIME YOU ENTER COLLEGE YOU 'RE GOING TO LIE TO YOUR MOM IN ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE INTERACTIONS BY THE TIME WE ENTER THIS WORK WORLD
PamelaMeyer_2011G A DECEPTION EPIDEMIC IN SHORT WHAT ONE AUTHOR CALLS A POST TRUTH SOCIETY IT 'S BEEN VERY CONFUSING FOR A LONG TIME NOW
PamelaMeyer_2011G WHAT DO YOU DO WELL
PamelaMeyer_2011G THERE ARE GOOD LIARS AND THERE ARE BAD LIARS THERE ARE NO REAL ORIGINAL LIARS WE ALL MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES WE ALL USE THE SAME TECHNIQUES SO WHAT I 'M GOING TO DO IS I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU TWO PATTERNS OF DECEPTION AND THEN WE 'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE HOT SPOTS AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND THEM OURSELVES WE 'RE GOING TO START WITH SPEECH
PamelaMeyer_2011G WHAT WERE THE TELLTALE SIGNS WELL FIRST WE HEARD WHAT 'S KNOWN AS A NON CONTRACTED DENIAL STUDIES SHOW THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERDETERMINED IN THEIR DENIAL WILL RESORT TO FORMAL RATHER THAN INFORMAL LANGUAGE WE ALSO HEARD DISTANCING LANGUAGE THAT WOMAN WE KNOW THAT LIARS WILL UNCONSCIOUSLY DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THEIR SUBJECT
PamelaMeyer_2011G USING LANGUAGE AS THEIR TOOL
PamelaMeyer_2011G NOW IF BILL CLINTON HAD SAID WELL TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH
PamelaMeyer_2011G OR RICHARD NIXON 'S FAVORITE IN ALL CANDOR HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A DEAD GIVEAWAY FOR ANY LIESPOTTER THAN KNOWS THAT QUALIFYING LANGUAGE AS IT 'S CALLED QUALIFYING LANGUAGE LIKE THAT FURTHER DISCREDITS THE SUBJECT
PamelaMeyer_2011G NOW IF HE HAD REPEATED THE QUESTION IN ITS ENTIRETY OR IF HE HAD PEPPERED HIS ACCOUNT WITH A LITTLE TOO MUCH DETAIL AND WE 'RE ALL REALLY GLAD HE DIDN 'T DO THAT HE WOULD HAVE FURTHER DISCREDITED HIMSELF
PamelaMeyer_2011G FREUD HAD IT RIGHT FREUD SAID LOOK THERE 'S MUCH MORE TO IT THAN SPEECH
PamelaMeyer_2011G NO MORTAL CAN KEEP A SECRET
PamelaMeyer_2011G IF HIS LIPS ARE SILENT
PamelaMeyer_2011G HE CHATTERS WITH HIS FINGERTIPS AND WE ALL DO IT NO MATTER HOW POWERFUL YOU ARE WE ALL CHATTER WITH OUR FINGERTIPS I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU DOMINIQUE STRAUSS KAHN WITH OBAMA WHO 'S CHATTERING WITH HIS FINGERTIPS
PamelaMeyer_2011G YOU CAN CONSCIOUSLY CONTRACT THE MUSCLES IN YOUR CHEEKS
PamelaMeyer_2011G BUT THE REAL SMILE 'S IN THE EYES THE CROW 'S FEET OF THE EYES THEY CANNOT BE CONSCIOUSLY CONTRACTED ESPECIALLY IF YOU OVERDID THE BOTOX DON 'T OVERDO THE BOTOX NOBODY WILL THINK YOU 'RE HONEST
PamelaMeyer_2011G NOW I KNOW IT SEEMS REALLY OBVIOUS BUT WHEN YOU 'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE YOU SUSPECT OF DECEPTION
PamelaMeyer_2011G NOW LET 'S SAY YOU 'RE HAVING THAT EXACT SAME CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE DECEPTIVE
PamelaMeyer_2011G THAT PERSON MAY BE WITHDRAWN
PamelaMeyer_2011G LOOK DOWN LOWER THEIR VOICE PAUSE BE KIND OF HERKY JERKY ASK A DECEPTIVE PERSON TO TELL THEIR STORY THEY 'RE GOING TO PEPPER IT WITH WAY TOO MUCH DETAIL IN ALL KINDS OF IRRELEVANT PLACES
PamelaMeyer_2011G AND THEN THEY 'RE GOING TO TELL THEIR STORY IN STRICT CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER AND WHAT A TRAINED INTERROGATOR DOES IS THEY COME IN
PamelaMeyer_2011G AND IN VERY SUBTLE WAYS OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL HOURS THEY WILL ASK THAT PERSON TO TELL THAT STORY BACKWARDS AND THEN THEY 'LL WATCH THEM SQUIRM AND TRACK WHICH QUESTIONS PRODUCE THE HIGHEST VOLUME OF DECEPTIVE TELLS WHY DO THEY DO THAT WELL WE ALL DO THE SAME THING WE REHEARSE OUR WORDS BUT WE RARELY REHEARSE OUR GESTURES
PamelaMeyer_2011G WE SAY YES WE SHAKE OUR HEADS NO WE TELL VERY CONVINCING STORIES WE SLIGHTLY SHRUG OUR SHOULDERS WE COMMIT TERRIBLE CRIMES AND WE SMILE AT THE DELIGHT IN GETTING AWAY WITH IT
PamelaMeyer_2011G NOW THAT SMILE IS KNOWN IN THE TRADE AS DUPING DELIGHT AND WE 'RE GOING TO SEE THAT IN SEVERAL VIDEOS MOVING FORWARD BUT WE 'RE GOING TO START FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON 'T KNOW HIM THIS IS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOHN EDWARDS WHO SHOCKED AMERICA BY FATHERING A CHILD OUT OF WEDLOCK WE 'RE GOING TO SEE HIM TALK ABOUT GETTING A PATERNITY TEST SEE NOW IF YOU CAN SPOT HIM
PamelaMeyer_2011G MURDERERS ARE KNOWN TO LEAK SADNESS YOUR NEW JOINT VENTURE PARTNER MIGHT SHAKE YOUR HAND CELEBRATE GO OUT TO DINNER WITH YOU AND THEN LEAK AN EXPRESSION OF ANGER AND WE 'RE NOT ALL GOING TO BECOME FACIAL EXPRESSION EXPERTS OVERNIGHT HERE BUT THERE 'S ONE I CAN TEACH YOU THAT 'S VERY DANGEROUS AND IT 'S EASY TO LEARN AND THAT 'S THE EXPRESSION OF CONTEMPT
PamelaMeyer_2011G IT 'S MARKED BY ONE LIP CORNER PULLED UP AND IN IT 'S THE ONLY ASYMMETRICAL EXPRESSION AND IN THE PRESENCE OF CONTEMPT WHETHER OR NOT DECEPTION FOLLOWS AND IT DOESN 'T ALWAYS FOLLOW
PamelaMeyer_2011G LOOK THE OTHER WAY GO THE OTHER DIRECTION RECONSIDER THE DEAL SAY NO THANK YOU I 'M NOT COMING UP FOR JUST ONE MORE NIGHTCAP THANK YOU
PamelaMeyer_2011G SCIENCE HAS SURFACED MANY MANY MORE INDICATORS WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW LIARS WILL SHIFT THEIR BLINK RATE
PamelaMeyer_2011G POINT THEIR FEET TOWARDS AN EXIT THEY WILL TAKE BARRIER OBJECTS AND PUT THEM BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE PERSON THAT IS INTERVIEWING THEM THEY 'LL ALTER THEIR VOCAL TONE OFTEN MAKING THEIR VOCAL TONE MUCH LOWER NOW HERE 'S THE DEAL
PamelaMeyer_2011G THESE BEHAVIORS
PamelaMeyer_2011G ARE JUST BEHAVIORS THEY 'RE NOT PROOF OF DECEPTION
PamelaMeyer_2011G THEY 'RE RED FLAGS WE 'RE HUMAN BEINGS WE MAKE DECEPTIVE FLAILING GESTURES ALL OVER THE PLACE ALL DAY LONG THEY DON 'T MEAN ANYTHING IN AND OF THEMSELVES BUT WHEN YOU SEE CLUSTERS OF THEM THAT 'S YOUR SIGNAL LOOK LISTEN PROBE ASK SOME HARD QUESTIONS GET OUT OF THAT VERY COMFORTABLE MODE OF KNOWING WALK INTO CURIOSITY MODE ASK
PamelaMeyer_2011G NOW WE 'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO TALK TO SOMEONE WHO 'S LYING AND HOW TO SPOT A LIE AND AS I PROMISED WE 'RE NOW GOING TO LOOK AT WHAT THE TRUTH LOOKS LIKE BUT I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU TWO VIDEOS TWO MOTHERS
PamelaMeyer_2011G ONE IS LYING ONE IS TELLING THE TRUTH AND THESE WERE SURFACED BY RESEARCHER DAVID MATSUMOTO IN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK THEY 'RE AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE TRUTH LOOKS LIKE THIS MOTHER DIANE DOWNS SHOT HER KIDS AT CLOSE RANGE
PamelaMeyer_2011G DROVE THEM TO THE HOSPITAL WHILE THEY BLED ALL OVER THE CAR CLAIMED A SCRAGGY HAIRED STRANGER DID IT AND YOU 'LL SEE WHEN YOU SEE THE VIDEO SHE CAN 'T EVEN PRETEND TO BE AN AGONIZING MOTHER WHAT YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR HERE IS AN INCREDIBLE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN HORRIFIC EVENTS THAT SHE DESCRIBES
PamelaMeyer_2011G AND HER VERY VERY COOL DEMEANOR AND IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY YOU 'LL SEE DUPING DELIGHT THROUGHOUT THIS VIDEO
PamelaMeyer_2011G AROUND WHAT THE TRUTH LOOKS LIKE IS PROGRESSING ON THE SCIENCE OF IT WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE NOW HAVE SPECIALIZED EYE TRACKERS AND INFRARED BRAIN SCANS MRI 'S THAT CAN DECODE THE SIGNALS THAT OUR BODIES SEND OUT WHEN WE 'RE TRYING TO BE DECEPTIVE AND THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE GOING TO BE MARKETED TO ALL OF US AS PANACEAS FOR DECEIT
PamelaMeyer_2011G AND THEY WILL PROVE INCREDIBLY USEFUL SOME DAY BUT YOU 'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF IN THE MEANTIME WHO DO YOU WANT ON YOUR SIDE OF THE MEETING SOMEONE WHO 'S TRAINED IN GETTING TO THE TRUTH OR SOME GUY WHO 'S GOING TO DRAG A FOUR HUNDRED POUND ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM THROUGH THE DOOR
PamelaMeyer_2011G THEY KNOW AS SOMEONE ONCE SAID CHARACTER 'S WHO YOU ARE IN THE DARK AND WHAT 'S KIND OF INTERESTING IS THAT TODAY WE HAVE SO LITTLE DARKNESS OUR WORLD IS LIT UP TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY IT 'S TRANSPARENT
PamelaMeyer_2011G WITH BLOGS AND SOCIAL NETWORKS BROADCASTING THE BUZZ OF A WHOLE NEW GENERATION OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE MADE A CHOICE TO LIVE THEIR LIVES IN PUBLIC IT 'S A MUCH MORE NOISY WORLD
PamelaMeyer_2011G SO ONE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS TO REMEMBER
PamelaMeyer_2011G OUR MANIC TWEETING AND TEXTING CAN BLIND US TO THE FACT THAT THE SUBTLETIES OF HUMAN DECENCY CHARACTER INTEGRITY THAT 'S STILL WHAT MATTERS THAT 'S ALWAYS WHAT 'S GOING TO MATTER SO IN THIS MUCH NOISIER WORLD IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE FOR US TO BE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE
PamelaMeyer_2011G EXPLICIT ABOUT OUR MORAL CODE
PamelaMeyer_2011G WHEN YOU COMBINE THE SCIENCE OF RECOGNIZING DECEPTION WITH THE ART OF LOOKING LISTENING YOU EXEMPT YOURSELF FROM COLLABORATING IN A LIE
PamelaMeyer_2011G YOU START UP THAT PATH OF BEING JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPLICIT BECAUSE YOU SIGNAL TO EVERYONE AROUND YOU YOU SAY HEY MY WORLD OUR WORLD IT 'S GOING TO BE AN HONEST ONE MY WORLD IS GOING TO BE ONE WHERE TRUTH IS STRENGTHENED AND FALSEHOOD IS RECOGNIZED AND MARGINALIZED
