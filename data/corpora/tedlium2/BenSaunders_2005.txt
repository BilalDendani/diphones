BenSaunders_2005@44.15:52.02 THANK YOU I THINK THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT IT'S IT'S WELL IT'S AS CHRIS SAID BONKERS IT'S A JOURNEY THAT IS RIGHT AT THE LIMIT OF HUMAN

BenSaunders_2005@308.52:318.66 REASON THIS WAS WHAT I WANTED TO HAVE A CRACK AT BUT I KNEW THAT EVEN TO STAND A CHANCE OF GETTING HOME IN ONE PIECE LET ALONE MAKE IT ACROSS TO CANADA I HAD TO TAKE A RADICAL APPROACH

BenSaunders_2005@557.34:564.67 IT ALSO MEANT IF THE WORST CAME TO THE WORST I COULD ACTUALLY JUMP IN AND SWIM ACROSS AND DRAG THE SLEDGE OVER AFTER ME
BenSaunders_2005@564.96:572.07 SOME PRETTY RADICAL TECHNOLOGY A RADICAL APPROACH BUT IT WORKED PERFECTLY ANOTHER EXCITING THING WE DID LAST YEAR WAS WITH COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY

BenSaunders_2005@908.70:916.27 FOR ME THIS IS ABOUT EXPLORING HUMAN LIMITS ABOUT EXPLORING THE LIMITS OF PHYSIOLOGY OF PSYCHOLOGY AND OF TECHNOLOGY THEY'RE THE THINGS THAT EXCITE ME
BenSaunders_2005@930.46:940.66 SCRATCHING THE SURFACE OF THEIR POTENTIAL JUST DOING THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE PERCENT OF WHAT THEY'RE TRULY CAPABLE OF SO ON A WIDER SCALE I HOPE THAT THIS JOURNEY WAS A CHANCE TO INSPIRE
BenSaunders_2005@941.13:948.43 OTHER PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THEIR POTENTIAL AND WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THE TINY AMOUNT OF TIME WE EACH HAVE ON THIS PLANET
BenSaunders_2005@960.68:968.75 THE LAST QUESTION WHAT'S NEXT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IF I HAVE A MINUTE LEFT AT THE END I'LL GO INTO MORE DETAIL WHAT'S NEXT
