BenSaunders_2005 ONE AND A HALF TIMES THE SIZE OF AMERICA FIVE AND A HALF THOUSAND SQUARE MILES MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE CLIMBED EVEREST TWELVE PEOPLE HAVE STOOD ON THE MOON INCLUDING ME ONLY FOUR PEOPLE HAVE SKIED SOLO TO THE NORTH POLE AND I THINK THE REASON FOR THAT
BenSaunders_2005 THANK YOU I THINK THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT IT'S IT'S WELL IT'S AS CHRIS SAID BONKERS IT'S A JOURNEY THAT IS RIGHT AT THE LIMIT OF HUMAN
BenSaunders_2005 WE STARTED RUNNING VERY LOW ON FOOD WE WERE BOTH PRETTY HUNGRY LOSING LOTS OF WEIGHT SOME VERY UNUSUAL WEATHER CONDITIONS VERY DIFFICULT ICE CONDITIONS WE HAD
BenSaunders_2005 DECIDEDLY LOW TECH COMMUNICATIONS WE COULDN'T AFFORD A SATELLITE PHONE SO WE HAD HF RADIO YOU CAN SEE TWO SKI POLES STICKING OUT OF THE
BenSaunders_2005 A WIRE DANGLING DOWN EITHER SIDE THAT WAS OUR HF RADIO ANTENNA WE HAD LESS THAN TWO HOURS TWO WAY COMMUNICATION WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN TWO MONTHS
BenSaunders_2005 WE SPOKE TO THE RUSSIAN HELICOPTER PILOTS ON THE RADIO AND THEY SAID LOOK BOYS YOU'VE RUN OUT OF TIME WE'VE GOT TO PICK YOU UP AND I FELT THAT I HAD
BenSaunders_2005 OF THIS EXPEDITION AND I GOT BACK TO HEATHROW MY MUM WAS THERE MY BROTHER WAS THERE MY GRANDDAD WAS THERE HAD
BenSaunders_2005 IN A HUGE AMOUNT OF DEBT PERSONALLY TO THIS EXPEDITION AND LYING ON MY MUM 'S SOFA DAY IN DAY OUT WATCHING DAYTIME TV
BenSaunders_2005 MY BROTHER SENT ME A TEXT MESSAGE AN SMS IT'S IT WAS A QUOTE FROM THE SIMPSONS IT SAID YOU TRIED YOUR HARDEST AND FAILED MISERABLY THE LESSON IS DON'T EVEN TRY
BenSaunders_2005 THREE YEARS I DID EVENTUALLY GET OFF THE SOFA AND START PLANNING ANOTHER EXPEDITION THIS TIME I WANTED TO GO RIGHT ACROSS ON MY OWN THIS TIME FROM RUSSIA AT THE TOP OF THE MAP
BenSaunders_2005 REASON THIS WAS WHAT I WANTED TO HAVE A CRACK AT BUT I KNEW THAT EVEN TO STAND A CHANCE OF GETTING HOME IN ONE PIECE LET ALONE MAKE IT ACROSS TO CANADA I HAD TO TAKE A RADICAL APPROACH
BenSaunders_2005 AND THE EXPEDITION STARTED IN FEBRUARY LAST YEAR BIG SUPPORT TEAM WE HAD A FILM CREW A COUPLE OF LOGISTICS PEOPLE WITH US
BenSaunders_2005 THE NEXT BIT WE'D CHARTERED A PRETTY ELDERLY RUSSIAN PLANE TO FLY US UP TO A TOWN CALLED KHATANGA WHICH WAS THE SORT OF LAST BIT OF CIVILIZATION
BenSaunders_2005 WE GOT TO KHATANGA I THINK THE JOKE IS THAT KHATANGA ISN'T THE END OF THE WORLD BUT YOU CAN SEE IT FROM
BenSaunders_2005 LOADED UP THE HELICOPTERS TWO HELICOPTERS FLYING IN TANDEM DROPPED ME OFF AT THE EDGE OF THE PACK ICE
BenSaunders_2005 TO MAKE THINGS WORSE YOU CAN JUST SEE THE WHITE DOT UP AT THE TOP RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN THAT'S A FULL MOON BECAUSE WE'D BEEN HELD UP IN RUSSIA OF COURSE THE FULL MOON BRINGS THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST TIDES
BenSaunders_2005 I DIDN'T HAVE A HOPE IN HELL I HAD TO PULL ONE LEAVE IT AND GO BACK AND GET THE OTHER ONE LITERALLY SCRAMBLING THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED PRESSURE ICE THE ICE HAD BEEN
BenSaunders_2005 MY RECORD WAS MINUS TWO POINT FIVE MILES I GOT UP IN THE MORNING TOOK THE TENT DOWN SKIED NORTH FOR SEVEN AND A HALF HOURS PUT THE TENT UP AND I WAS TWO AND A HALF MILES FURTHER BACK THAN WHEN I'D STARTED I LITERALLY COULDN'T KEEP UP WITH THE DRIFT OF THE ICE
BenSaunders_2005 JUST APPALLING OH DRIFTED BACK ABOUT FIVE MILES IN THE LAST LAST
BenSaunders_2005 LATER IN THE EXPEDITION THE PROBLEM WAS NO LONGER THE ICE IT WAS
BenSaunders_2005 IT ALSO MEANT IF THE WORST CAME TO THE WORST I COULD ACTUALLY JUMP IN AND SWIM ACROSS AND DRAG THE SLEDGE OVER AFTER ME
BenSaunders_2005 SOME PRETTY RADICAL TECHNOLOGY A RADICAL APPROACH BUT IT WORKED PERFECTLY ANOTHER EXCITING THING WE DID LAST YEAR WAS WITH COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY
BenSaunders_2005 AS DANGEROUS AS EVEREST IT WASN'T ALL HIGH TECH THIS IS NAVIGATING IN WHAT'S CALLED A WHITEOUT WHEN YOU GET LOTS OF MIST LOW CLOUD THE WIND STARTS BLOWING THE SNOW UP YOU
BenSaunders_2005 I GOT TO THE POLE ON THE ELEVENTH OF MAY IT TOOK ME SIXTY EIGHT DAYS TO GET THERE FROM RUSSIA AND THERE IS NOTHING
BenSaunders_2005 THERE THERE ISN'T EVEN A POLE AT THE POLE THERE'S NOTHING THERE PURELY BECAUSE IT'S SEA ICE IT'S DRIFTING STICK A FLAG THERE LEAVE IT THERE PRETTY SOON IT WILL DRIFT OFF USUALLY TOWARDS CANADA OR GREENLAND I KNEW THIS BUT I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING
BenSaunders_2005 THAT SAT DOWN ON MY SLEDGE DID A SORT OF VIDEO DIARY PIECE TOOK A FEW PHOTOS I GOT MY SATELLITE PHONE OUT I WARMED THE BATTERY UP IN MY ARMPIT I DIALED THREE NUMBERS I DIALED MY MUM I DIALED MY GIRLFRIEND I DIALED THE CEO OF MY SPONSOR AND I GOT THREE
BenSaunders_2005 THE ENTIRE PLANET IS ROTATING BENEATH MY FEET
BenSaunders_2005 THE THE WHOLE WORLD
BenSaunders_2005 I FINALLY GOT THROUGH TO MY MUM SHE WAS AT THE QUEUE OF THE SUPERMARKET SHE STARTED CRYING
BenSaunders_2005 I SKIED ON FOR A WEEK PAST THE POLE I WANTED TO GET AS CLOSE TO CANADA AS I COULD BEFORE CONDITIONS JUST GOT TOO DANGEROUS TO CONTINUE
BenSaunders_2005 THIS WAS THE LAST DAY I HAD ON THE ICE WHEN I SPOKE TO THE MY PROJECT MANAGEMENT TEAM THEY SAID LOOK BEN CONDITIONS ARE GETTING TOO DANGEROUS
BenSaunders_2005 THERE ARE HUGE AREAS OF OPEN WATER JUST SOUTH OF YOUR POSITION WE'D LIKE TO PICK YOU UP BEN COULD YOU PLEASE LOOK FOR AN AIRSTRIP THIS WAS THE VIEW OUTSIDE MY TENT WHEN I HAD THIS FATEFUL PHONE CALL
BenSaunders_2005 FIND IT TOOK ME THIRTY SIX HOURS OF SKIING AROUND TRYING TO FIND AN AIRSTRIP WAS EXACTLY FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE METERS I COULD MEASURE IT WITH MY SKIS I DIDN'T TELL TONY THAT I DIDN'T TELL THE PILOTS THAT I THOUGHT IT'LL HAVE TO DO
BenSaunders_2005 IT JUST ABOUT WORKED A PRETTY DRAMATIC LANDING THE PLANE ACTUALLY PASSED OVER FOUR TIMES AND I WAS A BIT WORRIED IT WASN'T GOING TO LAND AT ALL THE PILOT I KNEW WAS CALLED TROY I WAS EXPECTING SOMEONE CALLED TROY THAT DID THIS FOR A LIVING TO BE A PRETTY
BenSaunders_2005 TOUGH KIND OF GUY I WAS BAWLING MY EYES OUT BY THE TIME THE PLANE LANDED
BenSaunders_2005 TROY TROY WAS SMOKING A CIGARETTE ON THE ICE WE TOOK A FEW PHOTOS HE CLIMBED UP THE LADDER HE SAID JUST JUST GET IN THE BACK HE THREW HIS CIGARETTE OUT AS HE GOT ON THE FRONT AND I CLIMBED IN THE BACK
BenSaunders_2005 HIS I THOUGHT GOD HERE WE GO WE 'RE WE'RE THIS IS ALL OR NOTHING RAMMED IT FORWARDS BOUNCED DOWN THE RUNWAY JUST TOOK OFF ONE OF THE SKIS JUST CLIPPED A PRESSURE RIDGE
BenSaunders_2005 I COULD SEE INTO THE COCKPIT TROY BATTLING THE CONTROLS AND HE JUST TOOK ONE HAND OFF REACHED BACK FLIPPED A SWITCH ON THE ROOF OF THE COCKPIT AND IT WAS THE FASTEN SEAT BELT SIGN YOU CAN
BenSaunders_2005 IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE I'M NOT SKIING ALONG DRAWING MAPS EVERYONE KNOWS WHERE THE NORTH POLE IS AT THE SOUTH POLE THERE'S A BIG SCIENTIFIC BASE THERE'S AN AIRSTRIP THERE'S A CAFE
BenSaunders_2005 FOR ME THIS IS ABOUT EXPLORING HUMAN LIMITS ABOUT EXPLORING THE LIMITS OF PHYSIOLOGY OF PSYCHOLOGY AND OF TECHNOLOGY THEY'RE THE THINGS THAT EXCITE ME
BenSaunders_2005 SCRATCHING THE SURFACE OF THEIR POTENTIAL JUST DOING THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE PERCENT OF WHAT THEY'RE TRULY CAPABLE OF SO ON A WIDER SCALE I HOPE THAT THIS JOURNEY WAS A CHANCE TO INSPIRE
BenSaunders_2005 OTHER PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THEIR POTENTIAL AND WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THE TINY AMOUNT OF TIME WE EACH HAVE ON THIS PLANET
BenSaunders_2005 THE LAST QUESTION WHAT'S NEXT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IF I HAVE A MINUTE LEFT AT THE END I'LL GO INTO MORE DETAIL WHAT'S NEXT
BenSaunders_2005 THE COLDEST HIGHEST WINDIEST AND DRIEST CONTINENT ON EARTH
BenSaunders_2005 AND SCOTT THE BRITISH GUY CAPTAIN SCOTT SCOTT HAD SORT OF PONIES AND SOME TRACTORS AND A FEW DOGS ALL OF WHICH WENT WRONG AND SCOTT AND HIS TEAM OF FOUR PEOPLE ENDED UP ON FOOT
BenSaunders_2005 I HAVE A SCHOOL REPORT I WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD AND IT'S FRAMED ABOVE MY DESK AT HOME IT SAYS BEN LACKS SUFFICIENT IMPETUS TO ACHIEVE ANYTHING
