DiannaCohen_2010Z UPON WORKING WITH THE PLASTIC AFTER ABOUT THE FIRST EIGHT YEARS SOME OF MY WORK STARTED TO FISSURE AND BREAK DOWN INTO SMALLER LITTLE BITS OF PLASTIC AND I THOUGHT
DiannaCohen_2010Z GREAT IT'S EPHEMERAL JUST LIKE US
DiannaCohen_2010Z UPON EDUCATING MYSELF A LITTLE FURTHER ABOUT PLASTICS I ACTUALLY REALIZED THIS WAS A BAD THING IT'S A BAD THING THAT PLASTIC BREAKS DOWN INTO SMALLER LITTLE BITS BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS STILL PLASTIC
DiannaCohen_2010Z AND WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT A LOT OF IT IS IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT I THEN IN THE LAST FEW YEARS LEARNED ABOUT THE PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH AND THE
DiannaCohen_2010Z AND MY INITIAL REACTION AND I THINK THIS IS A LOT OF PEOPLE 'S FIRST REACTION TO LEARNING ABOUT IT IS OH MY GOD WE'VE GOT TO GO OUT THERE AND CLEAN THIS THING UP
DiannaCohen_2010Z SO I ACTUALLY DEVELOPED A PROPOSAL TO GO OUT WITH A CARGO SHIP AND TWO DECOMMISSIONED FISHING TRAWLERS A CRANE A CHIPPING MACHINE AND A COLD MOLDING MACHINE
DiannaCohen_2010Z AND MY INTENTION WAS TO GO OUT TO THE GYRE RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND BEGIN TO PICK UP THE PLASTIC CHIP IT INTO LITTLE BITS AND COLD MOLD IT INTO BRICKS
DiannaCohen_2010Z COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED AS BUILDING MATERIALS IN UNDERDEVELOPED COMMUNITIES
DiannaCohen_2010Z I BEGAN TALKING WITH PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAD BEEN OUT TO THE GYRE AND WERE STUDYING THE PLASTIC PROBLEM IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT AND UPON DOING SO
DiannaCohen_2010Z I REALIZED ACTUALLY THAT CLEANING IT UP WOULD BE A VERY SMALL DROP IN THE BUCKET RELATIVE TO HOW MUCH IS BEING GENERATED EVERY DAY AROUND THE WORLD
DiannaCohen_2010Z AND THAT ACTUALLY I NEEDED TO BACK UP AND LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE AND THE BIGGER PICTURE IS WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO TURN OFF THE FAUCET
DiannaCohen_2010Z WE NEED TO CUT THE SPIGOT OF SINGLE USE AND DISPOSABLE PLASTICS WHICH ARE ENTERING THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT EVERY DAY ON A GLOBAL SCALE
DiannaCohen_2010Z SO IN LOOKING AT THAT I ALSO REALIZED THAT I WAS REALLY ANGRY I WASN'T JUST CONCERNED ABOUT PLASTIC THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO IMAGINE OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN OF WHICH I HAVE LEARNED THERE ARE NOW ELEVEN GYRES POTENTIALLY OF PLASTIC IN FIVE MAJOR OCEANS IN THE WORLD
DiannaCohen_2010Z I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE PLASTIC IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE PLASTIC AND THE TOXINS THAT LEACH FROM PLASTIC INTO US AND INTO OUR BODIES
DiannaCohen_2010Z SO I CAME TOGETHER WITH A GROUP OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE ALL LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE AND WE CREATED THE PLASTIC POLLUTION COALITION
DiannaCohen_2010Z WE HAVE MANY INITIATIVES THAT WE'RE WORKING ON BUT SOME OF THEM ARE VERY BASIC ONE IS
DiannaCohen_2010Z EIGHTY TO NINETY PERCENT OF WHAT WE'RE FINDING IN THE OCEAN OF THE MARINE DEBRIS THAT WE'RE FINDING IN THE OCEAN IS PLASTIC THEN WHY DON'T WE CALL IT WHAT IT IS IT'S PLASTIC POLLUTION
DiannaCohen_2010Z WHAT IS THE REALITY OF THAT IN THE UNITED STATES LESS THAN SEVEN PERCENT OF OUR PLASTICS ARE RECYCLED AND IF YOU REALLY LOOK INTO IT PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO PLASTIC BOTTLES MOST OF IT IS ONLY DOWNCYCLED OR INCINERATED OR SHIPPED TO CHINA
DiannaCohen_2010Z IT IS DOWNCYCLED AND TURNED INTO LESSER THINGS WHILE A GLASS BOTTLE CAN BE A GLASS BOTTLE AGAIN OR CAN BE USED AGAIN A PLASTIC BOTTLE CAN NEVER BE A PLASTIC BOTTLE AGAIN
DiannaCohen_2010Z SO THIS IS A BIG ISSUE FOR US ANOTHER THING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND ASKING PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT IS WE'VE ADDED A FOURTH R
DiannaCohen_2010Z THE FRONT OF THE REDUCE REUSE RECYCLE THREE R 'S AND THAT IS REFUSE WHENEVER POSSIBLE REFUSE SINGLE USE AND DISPOSABLE PLASTICS
DiannaCohen_2010Z VERY EASY TO PICK UP A STAINLESS STEEL BOTTLE OR A GLASS BOTTLE IF YOU'RE TRAVELING AND YOU'VE FORGOTTEN TO BRING YOUR STAINLESS STEEL BOTTLE AND FILL THAT UP WITH WATER OR FILTERED WATER VERSUS PURCHASING PLASTIC BOTTLED WATER
DiannaCohen_2010Z I GUESS WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO EVERYBODY HERE AND I KNOW THAT YOU GUYS KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS ISSUE IS THAT THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM IN THE OCEANS BUT THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT WE'VE CREATED AS CONSUMERS AND WE CAN SOLVE
DiannaCohen_2010Z WE CAN SOLVE THIS BY RAISING AWARENESS OF THE ISSUE AND TEACHING PEOPLE TO CHOOSE ALTERNATIVES SO WHENEVER POSSIBLE TO CHOOSE ALTERNATIVES TO SINGLE USE PLASTICS
DiannaCohen_2010Z WE CAN CUT THE STEM TIDE THE STEM OF THIS INTO OUR OCEANS AND IN DOING SO SAVE OUR OCEANS SAVE OUR PLANET SAVE OURSELVES THANK YOU
