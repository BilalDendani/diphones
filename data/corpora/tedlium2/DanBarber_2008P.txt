DanBarber_2008P I WENT TO SPAIN A FEW MONTHS AGO
DanBarber_2008P THE BEST FOIE GRAS OF MY LIFE
DanBarber_2008P BECAUSE WHAT I SAW I'M CONVINCED IS
DanBarber_2008P RIDICULOUS RIGHT FOIE GRAS AND THE FUTURE OF COOKING THERE'S NOT A FOOD TODAY THAT'S MORE MALIGNED THAN
DanBarber_2008P REALLY IT HAPPENED HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO TO
DanBarber_2008P I'M NOT SAYING THAT
DanBarber_2008P A RATIONALE
DanBarber_2008P FOR BEING OPPOSED TO FOIE GRAS
DanBarber_2008P THE REASONS USUALLY JUST BOIL DOWN TO THE GAVAGE WHICH IS THE FORCE FEEDING BASICALLY YOU TAKE A GOOSE OR A DUCK AND YOU
DanBarber_2008P IS THAT IT'S SO FREAKIN DELICIOUS
DanBarber_2008P YOU CAN ALSO BIKE THE TOUR DE FRANCE WITHOUT STEROIDS
DanBarber_2008P NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DOING IT AND FOR GOOD REASON SO SEVERAL MONTHS AGO
DanBarber_2008P A FRIEND OF MINE SENT ME THIS LINK TO THIS GUY
DanBarber_2008P GORGE ON FOOD TO PREPARE FOR THE HARSH REALITIES OF WINTER
DanBarber_2008P AND THE REST OF THE YEAR THEY'RE FREE TO ROAM AROUND EDUARDO 'S
DanBarber_2008P LAND AND EAT WHAT THEY WANT SO NO GAVAGE NO FORCE FEEDING NO FACTORY LIKE CONDITIONS NO CRUELTY
DanBarber_2008P AND IT'S SHOCKINGLY NOT A NEW IDEA HIS GREAT GRANDDAD STARTED
DanBarber_2008P WHEN EDUARDO
DanBarber_2008P THE COVETED FRENCH GASTRONOMIC PRIZE
DanBarber_2008P AS HE SAID TO ME THAT REALLY PISSED THE FRENCH OFF
DanBarber_2008P ALL OVER THE PAPERS I READ ABOUT
DanBarber_2008P SPANISH CHEF ACCUSED AND THE FRENCH ACCUSED HIM SPANISH CHEF ACCUSED
DanBarber_2008P OF CHEATING THE ACCUSED HIM OF PAYING OFF THE JUDGES
DanBarber_2008P HUGE SCANDAL FOR A FEW WEEKS COULDN'T FIND A SHRED OF EVIDENCE
DanBarber_2008P LOOK AT THE GUY HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A GUY WHO 'S PAYING OFF FRENCH JUDGES FOR HIS
DanBarber_2008P DOWN AND VERY SOON AFTERWARD NEW CONTROVERSY
DanBarber_2008P HE 'S LYING AND SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED AS FUNNY AS IT SOUNDS ARTICULATING IT NOW AND READING ABOUT IT ACTUALLY IF
DanBarber_2008P THAT IS UNTIL I WENT TO
DanBarber_2008P I SAW FIRST HAND A SYSTEM THAT IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME LIKE
DanBarber_2008P AND HE SAID TO ME REALLY FROM THE FIRST MOMENT MY LIFE 'S WORK
DanBarber_2008P IS TO GIVE THE GEESE WHAT THEY WANT
DanBarber_2008P THAT ABOUT FIFTY TIMES IN THE
DanBarber_2008P I'M JUST HERE TO GIVE THE GEESE WHAT THEY WANT ACTUALLY WHEN I SHOWED UP HE WAS LYING DOWN WITH THE GEESE WITH
DanBarber_2008P YOU KNOW I THOUGHT LIKE I'M SPEAKING TO YOU NOW RIGHT
DanBarber_2008P I FIGURED IT OUT
DanBarber_2008P DOING THIS AND AMAZINGLY THE GEESE WHO WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PADDOCK WHEN I WAS AROUND GET THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS KID WHEN I LOWERED MY VOICE THEY ALL CAME RIGHT UP TO US
DanBarber_2008P RIGHT UP TO US LIKE RIGHT UP TO HERE RIGHT ALONG THE FENCE LINE AND FENCE LINE WAS AMAZING IN ITSELF THE FENCE LIKE THIS CONCEPTION OF FENCE THAT WE HAVE IT'S TOTALLY BACKWARD WITH HIM THE ELECTRICITY ON THIS FIBERGLASS FENCE
DanBarber_2008P IS ONLY ON THE OUTSIDE
DanBarber_2008P HE REWIRED IT HE INVENTED IT I'VE NEVER SEEN IT
DanBarber_2008P FENCE IN ANIMALS YOU
DanBarber_2008P HE ELECTRIFIES ONLY THE OUTSIDE
DanBarber_2008P WHY BECAUSE HE SAID TO ME THAT HE FELT LIKE THE GEESE AND HE PROVED THIS ACTUALLY NOT JUST
DanBarber_2008P A CONCEIT HE PROVED THIS THE GEESE FELT MANIPULATED WHEN THEY WERE
DanBarber_2008P ON THE OUTSIDE SO IT WOULD PROTECT THEM AGAINST COYOTES AND OTHER PREDATORS
DanBarber_2008P NOW WHAT HAPPENED THEY ATE AND HE SHOWED ME ON A CHART HOW THEY ATE ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT MORE
DanBarber_2008P FEED TO FEED THEIR LIVERS
DanBarber_2008P THIS EXTRA HARD LAND INTO A TASTING MENU
DanBarber_2008P UPGRADES THE LIFE FOR THESE GEESE AND THEY ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE WHATEVER THEY WANT ANOTHER IRONY THE DOUBLE IRONY IS THAT ON THE FIGS AND THE OLIVES EDUARDO CAN MAKE MORE MONEY SELLING THOSE THAN HE CAN ON THE FOIE GRAS HE DOESN'T CARE
DanBarber_2008P THEY GET WHAT THEY WANT THEY LEAVE THE REST FOR ME AND I SELL
DanBarber_2008P HOW I'VE BEEN TRAINED YOU WANT TO LOOK AND SEE WHAT GOOD FOIE GRAS IS IT'S GOT TO BE BRIGHT YELLOW IT'S THE INDICATION THAT
DanBarber_2008P BECAUSE HE DOESN'T FORCE FEED BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
DanBarber_2008P TO SEED HE TOOK THE SEEDS HE PLANTED IT ON HIS THIRTY ACRES ALL AROUND AND THE GEESE LOVE THE LUPIN BUSH NOT FOR THE BUSH BUT FOR THE SEEDS AND WHEN THEY EAT THE SEEDS THEIR FOIE GRAS TURNS YELLOW
DanBarber_2008P RADIOACTIVE YELLOW BRIGHT YELLOW
DanBarber_2008P OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY FOIE GRAS YELLOW I'VE EVER SEEN
DanBarber_2008P FOR REAL IS HE MAKING SOME

DanBarber_2008P AND I SAY YOU 'RE TELLING ME THAT YOUR GEESE ARE CALLING TO THE WILD GEESE TO SAY COME FOR A VISIT AND HE SAYS
DanBarber_2008P THE DNA OF A

DanBarber_2008P THEIR DNA IS TO FIND THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE CONDUCIVE TO LIFE TO HAPPINESS
DanBarber_2008P THEY FIND IT HERE THE DON'T NEED ANYTHING MORE
DanBarber_2008P BRILLIANT RIGHT IMAGINE I DON'T KNOW IMAGINE A HOG FARM IN LIKE NORTH CAROLINA AND A WILD PIG COMES
DanBarber_2008P GOT TO TASTE IT BEFORE I LEFT
DanBarber_2008P TOOK ME TO HIS NEIGHBORHOOD RESTAURANT AND HE SERVED ME SOME OF HIS
DanBarber_2008P IT WAS INCREDIBLE AND THE PROBLEM WITH SAYING THAT OF COURSE IS THAT YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT IT RISKS HYPERBOLE REALLY EASILY

DanBarber_2008P REALLY IN LOVE WITH HIM AT THIS POINT BUT IT TRULY WAS THE BEST FOIE GRAS OF MY LIFE SO MUCH SO THAT I DON'T THINK I HAD EVER REALLY HAD FOIE GRAS UNTIL THAT MOMENT
DanBarber_2008P BUT THIS WAS TRANSFORMATIVE REALLY TRANSFORMATIVE AND I SAY TO YOU
DanBarber_2008P TASTE EXPERIENCE WITH
DanBarber_2008P A LOT OF HONESTY AND YOU COULD TASTE
DanBarber_2008P HERBS YOU COULD TASTE SPICES AND I KEPT I SAID YOU KNOW I SWEAR TO GOD I TASTED STAR
DanBarber_2008P WHEN HE HARVESTS THE FOIE GRAS HE STICKS THEM IN THIS JAR
DanBarber_2008P PEPPER NO OIL NO SPICES
DanBarber_2008P NEED SALT AND PEPPER AND HE DOESN'T NEED SPICES BECAUSE HE 'S GOT THIS POTPOURRI OF HERBS AND FLAVORS
DanBarber_2008P THAT HIS GEESE LOVE TO GORGE ON
DanBarber_2008P ADRIA THE
DanBarber_2008P HOW COME YOU DON'T GIVE HIM THIS
DanBarber_2008P HOW COME NO ONE 'S REALLY HEARD OF YOU
DanBarber_2008P AND IT MAY BE BECAUSE OF THE WINE OR IT MAY BE BECAUSE OF MY EXCITEMENT HE ANSWERED ME DIRECTLY AND HE SAID
DanBarber_2008P THEY CREATE
DanBarber_2008P A DISH WHERE ALL THE VECTORS POINT AT US
DanBarber_2008P AND AS HE SAID I THINK
DanBarber_2008P IT'S A GIFT FROM GOD
DanBarber_2008P WITH GOD SAYING YOU'VE DONE GOOD WORK SIMPLE
DanBarber_2008P I FLEW HOME I'M ON THE FLIGHT WITH MY LITTLE BLACK BOOK AND I TOOK YOU KNOW PAGES AND PAGES OF NOTES ABOUT IT I REALLY WAS MOVED AND IN THE CORNER OF ONE OF THESE ONE MY NOTES
DanBarber_2008P HE SAID I THINK IT'S AN INSULT TO HISTORY
DanBarber_2008P AND I WROTE INSULT TO HISTORY
DanBarber_2008P ON THE PLANE AND I'M JUST TEARING MY HAIR OUT IT'S LIKE WHY DIDN'T I FOLLOW UP ON THAT WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT
DanBarber_2008P SOME RESEARCH WHEN I GOT BACK
DanBarber_2008P JEWS INVENTED FOIE GRAS
DanBarber_2008P BY ACCIDENT
DanBarber_2008P THEY WERE LOOKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE TO SCHMALTZ
DanBarber_2008P AND HE DIDN'T WANT IT JUST IN THE FALL HE WANTED IT ALL YEAR ROUND AND HE DEMANDED THAT THE JEWS SUPPLY ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE
DanBarber_2008P AND THE JEWS FEARING FOR THEIR LIFE HAD TO COME UP WITH AN INGENIOUS IDEA OR AT LEAST
DanBarber_2008P IN A GREAT MOMENT
DanBarber_2008P OF FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES
DanBarber_2008P LIVER AND THE GOOD STUFF THEY KEPT FOR THEMSELVES SUPPOSEDLY ANYWAY I BELIEVE THAT ONE
DanBarber_2008P AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
DanBarber_2008P MEGA FARMS FEED LOTS
DanBarber_2008P WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BEEF CATTLE
DanBarber_2008P OR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHICKENS
DanBarber_2008P OR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BROCCOLI
DanBarber_2008P WHATEVER IT IS IT'S A MINDSET THAT IS REMINISCENT OF GENERAL MOTORS
DanBarber_2008P IT'S ROOTED IN EXTRACTION
DanBarber_2008P TAKE MORE SELL MORE WASTE MORE
DanBarber_2008P WE NEED NOW TO ADOPT
DanBarber_2008P A NEW CONCEPTION OF AGRICULTURE
DanBarber_2008P REALLY NEW ONE IN WHICH WE STOP TREATING
DanBarber_2008P THE PLANET AS IF IT WERE SOME KIND OF BUSINESS IN LIQUIDATION
DanBarber_2008P AND STOP DEGRADING RESOURCES UNDER THE GUISE OF CHEAP FOOD
DanBarber_2008P WE CAN START BY LOOKING TO FARMERS
DanBarber_2008P LIKE EDUARDO FARMERS THAT RELY ON NATURE
DanBarber_2008P FOR SOLUTIONS FOR ANSWERS
DanBarber_2008P RATHER THAN IMPOSING SOLUTIONS ON NATURE
DanBarber_2008P LISTENING AS JANINE BENYUS ONE OF MY FAVORITE WRITERS AND THINKERS ABOUT THIS TOPICS SAYS LISTENING TO NATURE 'S OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
DanBarber_2008P THE GREAT THING FOR CHEFS THE GREAT BLESSING FOR CHEFS
DanBarber_2008P IS THAT THE MOST ECOLOGICAL CHOICE FOR FOOD
DanBarber_2008P ALSO THE MOST ETHICAL CHOICE FOR FOOD WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BRUSSEL SPROUTS OR FOIE GRAS
DanBarber_2008P AND IT'S ALSO ALMOST ALWAYS AND I HAVEN'T FOUND AN EXAMPLE OTHERWISE BUT ALMOST ALWAYS
