DanBarber_2008P@451.30:454.87 ON THE OUTSIDE SO IT WOULD PROTECT THEM AGAINST COYOTES AND OTHER PREDATORS
DanBarber_2008P@455.55:460.27 NOW WHAT HAPPENED THEY ATE AND HE SHOWED ME ON A CHART HOW THEY ATE ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT MORE

DanBarber_2008P@952.76:956.28 ON THE PLANE AND I'M JUST TEARING MY HAIR OUT IT'S LIKE WHY DIDN'T I FOLLOW UP ON THAT WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT
DanBarber_2008P@959.87:960.92 SOME RESEARCH WHEN I GOT BACK
DanBarber_2008P@965.66:967.13 JEWS INVENTED FOIE GRAS
DanBarber_2008P@970.58:971.39 BY ACCIDENT
DanBarber_2008P@972.88:975.38 THEY WERE LOOKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE TO SCHMALTZ
DanBarber_2008P@1006.38:1012.00 AND HE DIDN'T WANT IT JUST IN THE FALL HE WANTED IT ALL YEAR ROUND AND HE DEMANDED THAT THE JEWS SUPPLY ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE
DanBarber_2008P@1013.26:1016.82 AND THE JEWS FEARING FOR THEIR LIFE HAD TO COME UP WITH AN INGENIOUS IDEA OR AT LEAST
DanBarber_2008P@1026.02:1027.26 IN A GREAT MOMENT
DanBarber_2008P@1027.66:1028.98 OF FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES
DanBarber_2008P@1033.54:1038.56 LIVER AND THE GOOD STUFF THEY KEPT FOR THEMSELVES SUPPOSEDLY ANYWAY I BELIEVE THAT ONE
DanBarber_2008P@1041.88:1043.16 AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
DanBarber_2008P@1053.21:1055.46 MEGA FARMS FEED LOTS
DanBarber_2008P@1074.06:1075.90 WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BEEF CATTLE
DanBarber_2008P@1076.86:1078.44 OR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHICKENS
DanBarber_2008P@1079.56:1080.71 OR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BROCCOLI
DanBarber_2008P@1092.61:1096.95 WHATEVER IT IS IT'S A MINDSET THAT IS REMINISCENT OF GENERAL MOTORS
DanBarber_2008P@1098.32:1099.80 IT'S ROOTED IN EXTRACTION
DanBarber_2008P@1101.24:1103.18 TAKE MORE SELL MORE WASTE MORE
DanBarber_2008P@1129.99:1131.86 WE NEED NOW TO ADOPT
DanBarber_2008P@1133.75:1135.34 A NEW CONCEPTION OF AGRICULTURE
DanBarber_2008P@1135.91:1138.89 REALLY NEW ONE IN WHICH WE STOP TREATING
DanBarber_2008P@1139.19:1142.90 THE PLANET AS IF IT WERE SOME KIND OF BUSINESS IN LIQUIDATION
DanBarber_2008P@1144.22:1148.44 AND STOP DEGRADING RESOURCES UNDER THE GUISE OF CHEAP FOOD
DanBarber_2008P@1149.75:1152.08 WE CAN START BY LOOKING TO FARMERS
DanBarber_2008P@1153.06:1155.82 LIKE EDUARDO FARMERS THAT RELY ON NATURE
DanBarber_2008P@1156.77:1158.22 FOR SOLUTIONS FOR ANSWERS
DanBarber_2008P@1158.97:1161.16 RATHER THAN IMPOSING SOLUTIONS ON NATURE
DanBarber_2008P@1162.35:1169.61 LISTENING AS JANINE BENYUS ONE OF MY FAVORITE WRITERS AND THINKERS ABOUT THIS TOPICS SAYS LISTENING TO NATURE 'S OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
DanBarber_2008P@1176.77:1180.88 THE GREAT THING FOR CHEFS THE GREAT BLESSING FOR CHEFS
DanBarber_2008P@1188.71:1191.64 IS THAT THE MOST ECOLOGICAL CHOICE FOR FOOD
DanBarber_2008P@1193.02:1197.17 ALSO THE MOST ETHICAL CHOICE FOR FOOD WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BRUSSEL SPROUTS OR FOIE GRAS
DanBarber_2008P@1198.33:1203.27 AND IT'S ALSO ALMOST ALWAYS AND I HAVEN'T FOUND AN EXAMPLE OTHERWISE BUT ALMOST ALWAYS
