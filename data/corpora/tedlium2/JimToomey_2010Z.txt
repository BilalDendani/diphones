JimToomey_2010Z@25.25:38.79 NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE HAPPY ENDINGS SO HOW DID I GET STARTED CARTOONING I DOODLED A LOT AS A KID AND IF YOU SPEND ENOUGH TIME DOODLING SOONER OR LATER SOMETHING HAPPENS ALL YOUR CAREER OPTIONS RUN OUT SO YOU HAVE
JimToomey_2010Z@60.69:69.80 AND IT'S BECOME THE FOUNDATION OF MY WORK BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IF IN A DAY I CAN SEE THE OCEAN DIFFERENTLY THEN I CAN EVOKE THAT SAME KIND OF CHANGE IN OTHERS ESPECIALLY KIDS
JimToomey_2010Z@89.72:97.36 THE LAND BUT WHEN YOU GET TO THE WATERS EDGE THE OCEAN LOOKS LIKE ONE GIANT PUDDLE OF BLUE PAINT AND THIS IS THE WAY I SAW THE OCEAN AT SCHOOL
JimToomey_2010Z@97.91:104.19 AS IF TO SAY ALL GEOGRAPHY AND SCIENCE LESSONS STOP AT WATER 'S EDGE THIS PART 'S NOT GOING TO BE ON THE TEST BUT
JimToomey_2010Z@104.46:112.81 THAT DAY I FLEW LOW OVER THE ISLANDS IT WAS A FAMILY TRIP TO THE CARIBBEAN AND I FLEW IN A SMALL PLANE LOW OVER THE ISLANDS THIS IS WHAT I SAW I SAW HILLS AND VALLEYS
JimToomey_2010Z@133.43:139.64 SO FROM THAT DAY ON I WAS AN ORDINARY KID WALKING AROUND ON DRY LAND BUT MY HEAD WAS DOWN THERE UNDERWATER
JimToomey_2010Z@140.00:149.15 UP UNTIL THAT DAY THESE WERE THE ANIMALS THAT WERE MOST COMMON IN MY LIFE THESE WERE THE ONES I'D LIKE TO DRAW ALL VARIATIONS OF FOUR LEGS AND
JimToomey_2010Z@164.68:172.41 THE DIFFERENCES IN SCALE BETWEEN THIS TINY SEA DRAGON AND THIS ENORMOUS HUMPBACK WHALE WAS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE
JimToomey_2010Z@188.88:196.50 SO IF YOU EVER FANTASIZE ABOUT GOING BACK IN TIME AND SEEING WHAT A DINOSAUR LOOKED LIKE THAT'S WHAT A DINOSAUR LOOKS LIKE SO YOU HAVE LIVING DINOSAURS
JimToomey_2010Z@197.21:206.90 SPACE ALIENS ANIMALS THAT EVOLVED IN ZERO GRAVITY IN HARSH CONDITIONS IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE NO HOLLYWOOD DESIGNER COULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING THAN THAT
JimToomey_2010Z@207.29:215.56 OR THIS FANGTOOTH THE PARTICLES IN THE WATER MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT'S FLOATING IN OUTER SPACE COULD YOU IMAGE IF WE LOOKED THROUGH THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE AND WE SAW THAT
JimToomey_2010Z@243.96:249.98 I LOVE TO DRAW THE DEEP SEA FISH BECAUSE THEY ARE SO UGLY BUT BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR OWN WAY
JimToomey_2010Z@262.24:266.46 LITTLE BIOLUMINESCENCE HERE GIVE HIM A HEADLIGHT MAYBE A BRAKE LIGHT
JimToomey_2010Z@273.02:278.09 BUT IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY THESE ANIMALS MAKE SUCH GREAT CARTOON CHARACTERS THEIR SHAPES AND SIZES
JimToomey_2010Z@287.92:290.08 TAKE THESE SEA TURTLES
JimToomey_2010Z@290.35:295.57 THEY KIND OF HAVE A SIXTH SENSE LIKE SUPERMAN 'S X RAY VISION THEY CAN SENSE THE MAGNETIC FIELDS OF THE EARTH
JimToomey_2010Z@303.63:307.85 MY TURTLE HANDS JUST TO MAKE THEM AN EASIER CARTOON CHARACTER TO WORK WITH
JimToomey_2010Z@319.23:331.49 OR TAKE THIS SEA CUCUMBER IT'S NOT AN ANIMAL WE DRAW CARTOONS OF OR DRAW AT ALL HE 'S LIKE AN UNDERWATER SPIDERMAN HE SHOOTS OUT THESE STICKY WEBS
JimToomey_2010Z@333.26:339.82 ENEMY OF COURSE SEA CUCUMBERS SHOOT THEM OUT THEIR REARS WHICH IN MY OPINION MAKES THEM MUCH MORE INTERESTING A SUPERHERO
JimToomey_2010Z@341.68:343.48 WEB ANYTIME HE 'S GOT TO PULL HIS PANTS DOWN
JimToomey_2010Z@384.42:390.95 HE CAN INFLATE HIMSELF WHEN HE WANTS TO BE INTIMIDATING OR TAKE THIS SWORDFISH
JimToomey_2010Z@403.17:411.18 OR THIS LIONFISH FOR INSTANCE IMAGINE TRYING TO MAKE FRIENDS COVERED WITH RAZOR SHARP POISONOUS BARBS
JimToomey_2010Z@412.00:414.74 IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO PUT ON YOUR FACEBOOK PAGE RIGHT
JimToomey_2010Z@424.75:435.15 MY CHARACTERS ARE MY LEAD CHARACTER 'S A SHARK NAMED SHERMAN HE 'S A GREAT WHITE SHARK AND I KIND OF BROKE THE MOLD WITH SHERMAN I DIDN'T WANT TO GO WITH THIS RUTHLESS PREDATOR
JimToomey_2010Z@437.42:443.06 IMAGE HE 'S KIND OF JUST OUT THERE MAKING A LIVING HE 'S SORT OF A HOMER SIMPSON WITH FINS AND THEN HIS
JimToomey_2010Z@443.95:452.54 IS A SEA TURTLE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE NAMED FILMORE HE USES HIS WONDERFUL SKILLS AT NAVIGATION TO WANDER THE OCEANS LOOKING FOR A MATE
JimToomey_2010Z@453.73:465.72 AND HE DOES MANAGE TO FIND THEM BUT GREAT NAVIGATION SKILLS LOUSY PICK UP LINES HE NEVER SEEMS TO SETTLE ON ANY PARTICULAR GIRL
JimToomey_2010Z@468.08:475.74 I HAVE A HERMIT CRAB NAMED HAWTHORNE WHO DOESN'T GET A LOT OF RESPECT AS A HERMIT CRAB SO HE KIND OF WISHES HE WERE A GREAT WHITE SHARK
JimToomey_2010Z@485.72:494.12 AND THEN I'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO ONE MORE CHARACTER THIS GUY ERNEST WHO IS BASICALLY A JUVENILE DELINQUENT IN A FISH BODY
JimToomey_2010Z@496.88:509.76 SO WITH CHARACTERS YOU CAN MAKE STORIES SOMETIMES MAKING A STORY IS AS EASY AS PUTTING TWO CHARACTERS IN A ROOM AND SEEING WHAT HAPPENS SO IMAGINE A GREAT WHITE SHARK AND A GIANT SQUID IN THE SAME BATHROOM
JimToomey_2010Z@511.71:518.07 OR SOMETIMES I TAKE THEM TO PLACES THAT PEOPLE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF BECAUSE THEY'RE UNDERWATER FOR INSTANCE I TOOK THEM SKIING IN THE MID ATLANTIC RANGE WHICH IS THIS
JimToomey_2010Z@550.43:561.32 THEN HE MEETS THE YETI CRAB THE FAMOUS VAMPIRE SQUID ELUSIVE HARD TO FIND AND THE DUMBO OCTOPUS WHICH LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE A CARTOON IN REAL LIFE THAT REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO CHANGE A THING WHEN I DREW IT
JimToomey_2010Z@561.97:569.79 I DID ANOTHER STORY ON MARINE DEBRIS I WAS SPEAKING TO A LOT OF MY FRIENDS IN THE CONSERVATION BUSINESS AND THEY
JimToomey_2010Z@592.02:602.33 SO WHAT I DID WAS I MADE AN ADVENTURE STRIP BASICALLY THIS BOTTLE TRAVELS A LONG WAY WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL READERS IS THAT PLASTIC DOESN'T REALLY GO AWAY IT JUST CONTINUES TO WASH DOWNSTREAM
JimToomey_2010Z@610.70:616.11 TWO SO I SENT THEM TO BOISE IDAHO
JimToomey_2010Z@616.43:625.24 WHERE THEY DROPPED A PLASTIC BOTTLE INTO THE BOISE SEWER SYSTEM AND IT ENDED UP IN THE BOISE RIVER AND THEN ON TO THE COLUMBIA RIVER
JimToomey_2010Z@625.74:636.86 AND THEN TO THE MOUTH OF THE COLUMBIA AND TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND THEN ON TO THIS PLACE CALLED THE GREAT PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH WHICH IS THIS GIANT PACIFIC GYRE IN THE NORTH PACIFIC WHERE A LOT OF THIS PLASTIC ENDS UP FLOATING AROUND
JimToomey_2010Z@638.91:649.67 AND THEN BACK ONTO THE LAGOON SO THAT WAS BASICALLY A BUDDY STORY WITH A PLASTIC BOTTLE FOLLOWING ALONG SO A LOT OF PEOPLE REMEMBER THE PLASTIC BOTTLE ANYWAY BUT WE
JimToomey_2010Z@662.51:672.14 AND I FELT LIKE SINCE MY MAIN CHARACTER WAS A SHARK THE COMIC STRIP WAS A PERFECT VEHICLE FOR TELLING THE PUBLIC ABOUT THIS NOW FINNING IS THE ACT OF TAKING A SHARK
JimToomey_2010Z@672.75:681.83 CUTTING THE VALUABLE FINS OFF AND THROWING THE LIVE ANIMAL BACK IN THE WATER IT'S CRUEL IT'S WASTEFUL THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY OR ENTERTAINING ABOUT IT BUT I REALLY WANTED TO TAKE THIS ISSUE
JimToomey_2010Z@694.18:702.86 DIES HE GETS FINNED AND THEN HE GETS THROWN OVERBOARD OSTENSIBLY HE 'S DEAD NOW AND SO I KILLED A CHARACTER THAT'S BEEN IN THE NEWSPAPER FOR FIFTEEN YEARS SO I GOT A LOT OF READER FEEDBACK ON
JimToomey_2010Z@703.74:711.76 MEANWHILE THE OTHER CHARACTERS ARE TALKING ABOUT SHARK FIN SOUP I DO THREE OR FOUR STRIPS AFTER THAT WHERE WE EXPLORE THE FINNING ISSUE AND THE SHARK FIN SOUP ISSUE
JimToomey_2010Z@713.26:719.94 SHARK HEAVEN THIS IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT COMIC STRIPS YOU KNOW YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE AUDIENCE SUSPENDING ITS SENSE OF DISBELIEF BECAUSE
JimToomey_2010Z@720.09:728.89 IF YOU START WITH A TALKING SHARK READERS PRETTY MUCH CHECK THEIR DISBELIEF AT THE DOOR YOU CAN KIND OF DO ANYTHING IT BECOMES A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE FOR SHERMAN
JimToomey_2010Z@737.58:740.45 THAT AND HE CLICKS THE BUY NOW BUTTON
JimToomey_2010Z@741.48:747.24 AND VOILA NEXT DAY AIR THEY SHOW UP AND THEY SURGICALLY REATTACH THEM I ENDED THAT SERIES WITH A KIND OF A
JimToomey_2010Z@748.43:754.70 THAT ENCOURAGED OUR NATIONAL MARINE FISHERY SERVICE TO FORCE OTHER COUNTRIES TO HAVE A STRONGER STANCE WITH SHARK MANAGEMENT
JimToomey_2010Z@767.78:776.41 AND IT'S AS DARK AS A CAVE AND YOU CAN HAVE ANYTHING IN THAT ROOM ANYTHING YOU WANT BUT YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN ONE TOOL A HAMMER
JimToomey_2010Z@833.92:837.77 EACH OF US EXPLORER SCIENTIST CARTOONIST SINGER CHEF
JimToomey_2010Z@838.90:846.16 TURN UP THE LIGHTS IN THEIR OWN WAY AND THAT'S WHAT I HOPE MY COMIC STRIP DOES IN A SMALL WAY THAT'S WHY I LIKE WHAT I DO THANKS FOR LISTENING
