MichaelPollan_2007@12.80:23.23 IT'S A SIMPLE IDEA ABOUT NATURE AND I WANT TO SAY A WORD FOR NATURE BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T TALKED THAT MUCH ABOUT IT THE LAST COUPLE DAYS I WANT TO SAY A WORD FOR THE SOIL AND THE BEES AND THE PLANTS AND THE ANIMALS
MichaelPollan_2007@24.58:28.50 AND TELL YOU ABOUT A TOOL A VERY SIMPLE TOOL THAT I HAVE FOUND
MichaelPollan_2007@35.21:42.32 VERY POWERFUL FOR I THINK CHANGING OUR RELATIONSHIP TO THE NATURAL WORLD AND TO THE OTHER SPECIES ON WHOM WE DEPEND
MichaelPollan_2007@51.92:57.12 IT'S NOT MY IDEA OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HIT ON IT BUT I'VE TRIED TO TAKE IT TO SOME NEW
MichaelPollan_2007@58.99:61.58 TELL YOU WHERE I GOT IT LIKE A LOT OF MY IDEAS
MichaelPollan_2007@62.34:65.34 LIKE A LOT OF THE TOOLS I USE I FOUND IT IN THE GARDEN
MichaelPollan_2007@65.83:67.24 I'M A VERY DEVOTED GARDENER
MichaelPollan_2007@67.97:80.55 AND THERE WAS A DAY ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO I WAS PLANTING POTATOES IT WAS THE FIRST WEEK OF MAY THIS WAS NEW ENGLAND WHEN THE APPLE TREES ARE JUST VIBRATING WITH BLOOM THEY'RE JUST WHITE CLOUDS ABOVE
MichaelPollan_2007@81.08:93.04 I WAS HERE PLANTING MY CHUNKS CUTTING UP POTATOES AND PLANTING IT AND THE BEES WERE WORKING ON THIS TREE BUMBLEBEES JUST MAKING THIS THING VIBRATE AND ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY LIKE ABOUT GARDENING
MichaelPollan_2007@93.71:103.58 IS THAT IT DOESN'T TAKE ALL YOUR CONCENTRATION YOU REALLY CAN'T GET HURT IT'S NOT LIKE WOODWORKING AND YOU CAN YOU HAVE PLENTY OF KIND OF MENTAL SPACE FOR SPECULATION
MichaelPollan_2007@114.67:117.27 HOW WAS OUR ROLE IN THIS GARDEN SIMILAR AND DIFFERENT
MichaelPollan_2007@117.86:119.75 AND I REALIZED WE ACTUALLY HAD QUITE A BIT IN COMMON
MichaelPollan_2007@120.25:121.55 BOTH OF US WERE
MichaelPollan_2007@126.21:132.25 AND BOTH OF US PROBABLY IF I CAN IMAGINE THE BEE 'S POINT OF VIEW THOUGHT WE WERE CALLING THE SHOTS
MichaelPollan_2007@141.23:148.38 AND I HAD SUMMONED THOSE GENES FROM A SEED CATALOG ACROSS THE COUNTRY BROUGHT IT AND I WAS PLANTING IT AND THAT
MichaelPollan_2007@149.07:157.04 NO DOUBT ASSUMED THAT IT HAD DECIDED I'M GOING FOR THAT APPLE TREE I'M GOING FOR THAT BLOSSOM I'M GOING TO GET THE NECTAR AND I'M
MichaelPollan_2007@159.19:161.37 WE HAVE A GRAMMAR THAT SUGGESTS
MichaelPollan_2007@169.18:179.40 THE POTATOES I WEED THE GARDEN I DOMESTICATE THE SPECIES BUT THAT DAY IT OCCURRED TO ME WHAT IF THAT GRAMMAR IS NOTHING MORE THAN A SELF SERVING CONCEIT
MichaelPollan_2007@179.93:185.35 BECAUSE OF COURSE THE BEE THINKS HE 'S IN CHARGE OR SHE'S IN CHARGE AND BUT WE KNOW BETTER WE KNOW
MichaelPollan_2007@186.07:195.82 THAT WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN THE BEE AND THAT FLOWER IS THAT BEE HAS BEEN CLEVERLY MANIPULATED BY THAT FLOWER AND WHEN I SAY MANIPULATED I'M TALKING ABOUT IN A DARWINIAN SENSE RIGHT I MEAN
MichaelPollan_2007@195.99:201.90 IT HAS EVOLVED A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF TRAITS COLOR SCENT FLAVOR PATTERN
MichaelPollan_2007@202.29:210.36 THAT HAS LURED THAT BEE IN AND THE BEE HAS BEEN CLEVERLY FOOLED INTO TAKING THE NECTAR AND ALSO PICKING UP SOME POWDER ON ITS LEG
MichaelPollan_2007@260.26:264.26 THOUGHT ALWAYS AND IN FACT HAD WRITTEN THIS IN MY FIRST BOOK THIS WAS A BOOK ABOUT GARDENING
MichaelPollan_2007@266.60:278.35 LAWNS WERE NATURE UNDER CULTURE 'S BOOT THAT THEY WERE TOTALITARIAN LANDSCAPES AND THAT WHEN WE MOWED THEM WE WERE CRUELLY SUPPRESSING THE SPECIES AND NEVER LETTING IT SET SEED OR DIE OR HAVE SEX
MichaelPollan_2007@278.95:287.58 AND THAT'S WHAT THE LAWN WAS BUT THEN I REALIZED NO THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE GRASSES WANT US TO DO I'M A DUPE I'M A DUPE OF THE LAWNS WHOSE
MichaelPollan_2007@290.39:296.37 IS TO OUT COMPETE THE TREES WHO IT COMPETES WITH WHO THEY COMPETE WITH FOR SUNLIGHT AND SO BY GETTING US TO MOW THE
MichaelPollan_2007@297.77:305.41 KEEP THE TREES FROM COMING BACK WHICH IN NEW ENGLAND HAPPENS VERY VERY QUICKLY SO I STARTED LOOKING AT THINGS THIS WAY AND WROTE A WHOLE BOOK ABOUT
MichaelPollan_2007@315.18:324.49 BEES THAT THEY LIKE SWEETNESS AND THEY LIKE THIS COLOR AND NOT THAT COLOR THAT THEY LIKE SYMMETRY WHAT COULD WE FIND OUT ABOUT OURSELVES BY DOING THE SAME THING
MichaelPollan_2007@324.92:334.59 THAT A CERTAIN KIND OF POTATO A CERTAIN KIND OF DRUG A SATIVA INDICA CANNABIS CROSS HAS SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT US AND THAT
MichaelPollan_2007@343.60:344.58 IS WHAT DOES IT GET
MichaelPollan_2007@349.95:358.63 HOW DOES IT MEET THE ALDO LEOPOLD TEST WHICH IS DOES IT MAKE US BETTER CITIZENS OF THE BIOTIC COMMUNITY GET US TO DO THINGS THAT
MichaelPollan_2007@359.23:367.02 LEADS TO THE SUPPORT AND PERPETUATION OF THE BIOTA RATHER THAN ITS DESTRUCTION AND I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THIS IDEA DOES THIS
MichaelPollan_2007@380.26:381.54 SPECIES POINTS OF VIEW
MichaelPollan_2007@382.36:391.29 HELPS US DEAL WITH THIS WEIRD ANOMALY WHICH IS AND THIS IS IN THE REALM OF INTELLECTUAL HISTORY WHICH IS THAT WE HAVE THIS DARWINIAN REVOLUTION
MichaelPollan_2007@391.73:392.83 ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO
MichaelPollan_2007@398.65:413.12 WE HAVE THIS INTELLECTUAL THIS DARWINIAN REVOLUTION IN WHICH THANKS TO DARWIN WE FIGURED OUT WE ARE JUST ONE SPECIES AMONG MANY EVOLUTION IS WORKING ON US THE SAME WAY IT'S WORKING ON ALL THE OTHERS WE ARE ACTED UPON AS WELL AS ACTING
MichaelPollan_2007@413.45:422.71 WE ARE REALLY IN THE FIBER THE FABRIC OF LIFE BUT THE WEIRD THING IS WE DON'T WE HAVE NOT ABSORBED THIS LESSON ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS LATER NONE OF US REALLY BELIEVES THIS
MichaelPollan_2007@425.76:428.40 THE CHILDREN OF DESCARTES WHO BELIEVE THAT
MichaelPollan_2007@440.20:447.87 AS SOON AS YOU START SEEING THINGS FROM THE PLANT 'S POINT OF VIEW OR THE ANIMAL 'S POINT OF VIEW YOU REALIZE THAT THE REAL LITERARY CONCEIT IS THAT
MichaelPollan_2007@448.77:455.26 IS THIS THE IDEA THAT NATURE IS OPPOSED TO CULTURE THE IDEA THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS EVERYTHING
MichaelPollan_2007@462.26:465.52 IS A CURE FOR THE DISEASE OF HUMAN SELF IMPORTANCE
MichaelPollan_2007@466.55:468.20 YOU SUDDENLY REALIZE
MichaelPollan_2007@468.90:470.20 THAT CONSCIOUSNESS
MichaelPollan_2007@471.33:479.78 WHICH WE VALUE AND WE CONSIDER THE YOU KNOW THE CROWN OF THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT OF NATURE HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS IS REALLY JUST ANOTHER SET OF TOOLS
MichaelPollan_2007@480.21:481.55 FOR GETTING ALONG IN THE WORLD
MichaelPollan_2007@482.34:491.54 AND IT'S KIND OF NATURAL THAT WE WOULD THINK IT WAS THE BEST TOOL BUT YOU KNOW AS THERE'S A COMEDIAN WHO SAID WELL WHO 'S TELLING ME THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS SO GOOD AND SO IMPORTANT
MichaelPollan_2007@494.02:500.16 SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PLANTS YOU REALIZE THAT THEY'RE OTHER TOOLS AND THEY'RE JUST AS INTERESTING I'LL GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES
MichaelPollan_2007@508.45:511.94 IT RELEASES THIS VOLATILE CHEMICAL THAT GOES OUT INTO THE WORLD
MichaelPollan_2007@512.42:513.93 AND SUMMONS ANOTHER SPECIES
MichaelPollan_2007@514.99:515.86 THAT COMES IN
MichaelPollan_2007@516.82:521.80 THE SPIDER MITE DEFENDING THE LIMA BEAN SO WHAT PLANTS HAVE WHILE WE HAVE
MichaelPollan_2007@527.54:531.15 AND THEY HAVE PERFECTED THAT TO A DEGREE FAR BEYOND WHAT WE CAN IMAGINE
MichaelPollan_2007@531.66:539.20 AND THEIR COMPLEXITY THEIR SOPHISTICATION IS SOMETHING TO REALLY MARVEL AT AND I THINK IT'S REALLY THE SCANDAL OF THE HUMAN GENOME PROJECT
MichaelPollan_2007@539.83:551.66 YOU KNOW WE WENT INTO IT THINKING FORTY OR FIFTY THOUSAND HUMAN GENES AND WE CAME OUT WITH ONLY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND JUST TO GIVE YOU GROUNDS FOR COMPARISON RICE
MichaelPollan_2007@563.66:564.98 JUST ALONG DIFFERENT PATHS
MichaelPollan_2007@566.59:566.94 SO
MichaelPollan_2007@568.07:581.76 CURE FOR SELF IMPORTANCE WAY TO SORT OF MAKE US FEEL THE DARWINIAN IDEA AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I DO AS A WRITER AS A STORYTELLER IS TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE KIND OF FEEL WHAT WE KNOW AND TELL STORIES THAT
MichaelPollan_2007@590.57:601.51 TO DEVELOP MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE FOOD SYSTEM AND WHAT I LEARNED IN FACT IS THAT WE ARE ALL NOW BEING MANIPULATED BY CORN AND THE TALK YOU HEARD ABOUT ETHANOL EARLIER TODAY
MichaelPollan_2007@602.81:606.76 TO ME IS THE FINAL TRIUMPH OF CORN OVER GOOD SENSE
MichaelPollan_2007@609.67:610.91 IT IS PART OF
MichaelPollan_2007@613.21:615.15 CORN 'S SCHEME FOR WORLD DOMINATION
MichaelPollan_2007@616.08:624.38 AND YOU WILL SEE THE AMOUNT OF CORN PLANTED THIS YEAR WILL BE UP DRAMATICALLY FROM LAST YEAR AND THERE WILL BE THAT MUCH MORE HABITAT BECAUSE WE'VE DECIDED ETHANOL IS GOING TO HELP US
MichaelPollan_2007@625.71:630.15 SO BUT LET ME SO IT HELPED ME UNDERSTAND INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURE WHICH OF COURSE IS A CARTESIAN
MichaelPollan_2007@630.53:641.12 IT'S BASED ON THIS IDEA THAT WE BEND OTHER SPECIES TO OUR WILL AND THAT WE ARE IN CHARGE AND THAT WE CREATE THESE FACTORIES AND WE HAVE THESE TECHNOLOGICAL INPUTS AND WE GET THE FOOD OUT OF IT OR THE FUEL OR WHATEVER WE WANT
MichaelPollan_2007@643.05:654.22 LET ME TAKE YOU TO A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF FARM THIS IS A FARM IN THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY OF VIRGINIA I WENT LOOKING FOR A FARM WHERE THESE IDEAS ABOUT LOOKING AT THINGS FROM THE SPECIES POINT OF VIEW ARE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED
MichaelPollan_2007@654.48:663.84 AND I FOUND IT IN A MAN THE FARMER 'S NAME IS JOEL SALATIN AND I SPENT A WEEK AS AN APPRENTICE ON HIS FARM AND I TOOK AWAY FROM THIS SOME OF THE MOST HOPEFUL NEWS
MichaelPollan_2007@664.40:671.01 ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP TO NATURE THAT I'VE EVER COME ACROSS IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF WRITING ABOUT NATURE AND THAT IS THIS THE FARM IS CALLED POLYFACE
MichaelPollan_2007@682.61:687.50 THAT THE COWS AND THE PIGS AND THE SHEEP AND THE TURKEYS AND
MichaelPollan_2007@690.13:701.36 WHAT ELSE WHAT ELSE DOES HE HAVE ALL THE SIX DIFFERENT SPECIES RABBITS ACTUALLY ARE ALL PERFORMING ECOLOGICAL SERVICES FOR ONE ANOTHER SUCH THAT THE MANURE OF ONE IS THE LUNCH FOR THE OTHER AND THEY TAKE CARE OF PESTS FOR ONE ANOTHER
MichaelPollan_2007@711.10:717.96 AND HIS CHICKENS HIS LAYING HENS AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW IF YOU TAKE THIS APPROACH WHAT YOU GET OK
MichaelPollan_2007@718.16:729.47 AND THIS IS A LOT MORE THAN GROWING FOOD AS YOU'LL SEE THIS IS A DIFFERENT WAY TO THINK ABOUT NATURE AND A WAY TO GET AWAY FROM THE ZERO SUM NOTION THAT THE CARTESIAN IDEA THAT EITHER NATURE 'S WINNING OR WE'RE WINNING
MichaelPollan_2007@730.08:739.58 AND THAT FOR US TO GET WHAT WE WANT NATURE IS DIMINISHED SO ONE DAY CATTLE IN A PEN THE ONLY TECHNOLOGY INVOLVED HERE IS THIS CHEAP ELECTRIC FENCING RELATIVELY NEW
MichaelPollan_2007@740.04:750.78 TO A CAR BATTERY EVEN I COULD CARRY A QUARTER ACRE PADDOCK SET IT UP IN FIFTEEN MINUTES COWS GRAZE ONE DAY THEY MOVE OK THEY GRAZE EVERYTHING DOWN INTENSIVE GRAZING
MichaelPollan_2007@751.46:763.51 HE WAITS THREE DAYS AND THEN WE TOWED IN SOMETHING CALLED THE EGGMOBILE THE EGGMOBILE IS A VERY RICKETY CONTRAPTION IT LOOKS LIKE A PRAIRIE SCHOONER MADE OUT OF BOARDS BUT IT HOUSES THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CHICKENS
MichaelPollan_2007@764.14:769.00 HE TOWS THIS INTO THE PADDOCK THREE DAYS LATER AND OPENS THE GANGPLANK
MichaelPollan_2007@770.10:780.22 TURNS THEM DOWN AND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY HENS COME STREAMING DOWN THE GANGPLANK CLUCKING GOSSIPING AS CHICKENS WILL AND THEY MAKE A BEELINE FOR THE COW PATTIES
MichaelPollan_2007@780.91:785.38 AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS VERY INTERESTING THEY'RE DIGGING THROUGH THE COW PATTIES FOR THE MAGGOTS
MichaelPollan_2007@785.97:797.97 THE GRUBS THE LARVAE OF FLIES AND THE REASON HE 'S WAITED THREE DAYS IS BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT ON THE FOURTH DAY OR THE FIFTH DAY THOSE LARVAE WILL HATCH AND THEY'LL HAVE A HUGE FLY PROBLEM
MichaelPollan_2007@813.21:815.11 IN THE PROCESS THEY'RE SPREADING
MichaelPollan_2007@817.28:820.99 VERY USEFUL SECOND ECOSYSTEM SERVICE AND THIRD WHILE THEY'RE IN THIS
MichaelPollan_2007@823.16:830.47 ARE OF COURSE DEFECATING MADLY AND THEIR VERY NITROGENOUS MANURE IS FERTILIZING THIS FIELD
MichaelPollan_2007@831.81:840.53 THEY THEN MOVE OUT TO THE NEXT ONE AND IN THE COURSE OF JUST A FEW WEEKS THE GRASS JUST ENTERS THIS BLAZE OF GROWTH
MichaelPollan_2007@840.84:849.02 AND WITHIN FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS HE CAN DO IT AGAIN HE CAN GRAZE AGAIN HE CAN CUT HE CAN BRING IN ANOTHER SPECIES LIKE THE LAMBS OR HE CAN
MichaelPollan_2007@849.91:851.78 MAKE HAY FOR THE WINTER NOW
MichaelPollan_2007@852.46:861.78 I WANT YOU TO JUST LOOK REALLY CLOSE UP ONTO WHAT'S HAPPENED THERE SO IT'S A VERY PRODUCTIVE SYSTEM AND WHAT I NEED TO TELL YOU IS THAT ON ONE HUNDRED ACRES HE GETS FORTY THOUSAND POUNDS OF BEEF THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS OF PORK
MichaelPollan_2007@870.98:873.91 WELL LOOK HOW MUCH FOOD YOU CAN PRODUCE ON ONE HUNDRED ACRES IF YOU DO THIS KIND OF
MichaelPollan_2007@894.21:901.53 CUT FROM THIS HEIGHT TO THIS HEIGHT AND IT IMMEDIATELY DOES SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING ANY ONE OF YOU WHO GARDENS KNOWS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED THE ROOT SHOOT RATIO
MichaelPollan_2007@901.83:910.69 AND PLANTS NEED TO KEEP THE ROOT MASS IN SOME ROUGH BALANCE WITH THE LEAF MASS TO BE HAPPY SO WHEN THEY LOSE A LOT OF LEAF MASS
MichaelPollan_2007@929.70:937.09 THIS IS HOW SOIL IS CREATED IT'S CREATED FROM THE BOTTOM UP THIS IS HOW THE PRAIRIES WERE BUILT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BISON AND GRASSES
MichaelPollan_2007@938.55:945.53 AND WHAT I REALIZED WHEN I UNDERSTOOD THIS AND IF YOU ASK JOEL SALATIN WHAT HE IS HE'LL TELL YOU HE 'S NOT A CHICKEN FARMER HE 'S NOT A
MichaelPollan_2007@946.53:949.10 SHEEP FARMER HE 'S NOT A CATTLE RANCHER HE 'S A GRASS
MichaelPollan_2007@950.08:953.67 BECAUSE GRASS IS REALLY THE KEYSTONE SPECIES OF SUCH A SYSTEM
MichaelPollan_2007@955.47:956.17 IS THAT
MichaelPollan_2007@957.66:962.51 IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THIS COMPLETELY CONTRADICTS THE TRAGIC IDEA OF NATURE WE HOLD IN OUR HEADS
MichaelPollan_2007@964.49:970.37 WHICH IS THAT FOR US TO GET WHAT WE WANT NATURE IS DIMINISHED MORE FOR US LESS FOR NATURE
MichaelPollan_2007@972.11:973.98 HERE ALL THIS FOOD COMES OFF THIS FARM
MichaelPollan_2007@974.65:977.05 AND AT THE END OF THE SEASON THERE IS ACTUALLY MORE
MichaelPollan_2007@980.34:981.61 AND MORE BIODIVERSITY
MichaelPollan_2007@983.34:993.04 IT'S A REMARKABLY HOPEFUL THING TO DO THERE ARE A LOT OF FARMERS DOING THIS TODAY THIS IS WELL BEYOND ORGANIC AGRICULTURE WHICH IS STILL A CARTESIAN SYSTEM MORE OR LESS
MichaelPollan_2007@993.72:1006.41 AND WHAT IT TELLS YOU IS THAT IF YOU BEGIN TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF OTHER SPECIES TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE SOIL THAT EVEN WITH WITH NOTHING MORE THAN THIS PERSPECTIVAL IDEA
MichaelPollan_2007@1007.33:1019.53 BECAUSE THERE IS NO TECHNOLOGY INVOLVED HERE EXCEPT FOR THOSE FENCES WHICH COULD BE YOU KNOW THEY'RE SO CHEAP THEY COULD BE ALL OVER AFRICA IN NO TIME THAT YOU CAN WE CAN TAKE THE FOOD WE NEED FROM THE EARTH
MichaelPollan_2007@1022.23:1024.62 HEAL THE EARTH IN THE PROCESS THIS
MichaelPollan_2007@1025.23:1026.90 IS A WAY TO REANIMATE THE WORLD
MichaelPollan_2007@1038.39:1040.85 ARE SOMETHING TO BE VERY HOPEFUL ABOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
