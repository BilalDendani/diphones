HansRosling_2010W FOUR YEARS OLD WHEN I SAW MY MOTHER LOAD A WASHING MACHINE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE
HansRosling_2010W THAT WAS A GREAT DAY FOR MY MOTHER
HansRosling_2010W MY MOTHER AND FATHER HAD BEEN SAVING MONEY FOR YEARS TO BE ABLE TO BUY THAT MACHINE AND THE FIRST DAY IT WAS GOING TO BE USED EVEN GRANDMA WAS INVITED TO SEE THE MACHINE AND GRANDMA WAS EVEN MORE EXCITED
HansRosling_2010W THROUGHOUT HER LIFE SHE HAD BEEN HEATING WATER WITH FIREWOOD AND SHE HAD HAND WASHED LAUNDRY FOR SEVEN CHILDREN AND NOW SHE WAS GOING TO WATCH ELECTRICITY DO THAT WORK MY MOTHER CAREFULLY OPENED THE DOOR
HansRosling_2010W AND SHE LOADED THE LAUNDRY INTO THE MACHINE LIKE THIS AND THEN WHEN SHE CLOSED THE DOOR GRANDMA SAID NO NO NO NO LET ME LET ME PUSH THE BUTTON
HansRosling_2010W AND GRANDMA PUSHED THE BUTTON
HansRosling_2010W TODAY IN SWEDEN AND OTHER RICH COUNTRIES PEOPLE ARE USING SO MANY DIFFERENT MACHINES LOOK THE HOMES ARE FULL OF MACHINES I CAN 'T EVEN NAME THEM ALL AND THEY ALSO WHEN THEY WANT TO TRAVEL THEY USE
HansRosling_2010W FLYING MACHINES THAT CAN TAKE THEM TO REMOTE DESTINATIONS AND YET IN THE WORLD THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO STILL HEAT THE WATER ON FIRE AND THEY COOK THEIR FOOD ON FIRE SOMETIMES THEY DON 'T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH FOOD
HansRosling_2010W AND THEY LIVE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE THERE ARE TWO BILLION FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS WHO LIVE ON LESS THAN TWO DOLLARS A DAY
HansRosling_2010W AND THE RICHEST PEOPLE OVER THERE
HansRosling_2010W BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW MANY HAVE WASHING MACHINES
HansRosling_2010W I 'VE DONE THE SCRUTINY OF MARKET DATA AND I 'VE FOUND THAT INDEED THE WASHING MACHINE HAS PENETRATED BELOW THE AIR LINE AND TODAY THERE 'S AN ADDITIONAL ONE BILLION PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO LIVE ABOVE THE WASH LINE
HansRosling_2010W THEY WASH LIKE THIS BY HAND
HansRosling_2010W IT 'S A HARD TIME CONSUMING
HansRosling_2010W LABOR WHICH THEY HAVE TO DO FOR HOURS EVERY WEEK AND SOMETIMES THEY ALSO HAVE TO BRING WATER FROM FAR AWAY TO DO THE LAUNDRY AT HOME OR THEY HAVE TO BRING THE LAUNDRY AWAY TO A STREAM FAR OFF
HansRosling_2010W AND THEY WANT THE WASHING MACHINE THEY DON 'T WANT TO SPEND SUCH A LARGE PART OF THEIR LIFE DOING THIS HARD WORK WITH SO RELATIVELY LOW PRODUCTIVITY
HansRosling_2010W AND THERE 'S NOTHING DIFFERENT IN THEIR WISH THAN IT WAS FOR MY GRANDMA LOOK HERE TWO GENERATIONS AGO IN SWEDEN PICKING WATER FROM THE STREAM HEATING WITH FIREWOOD AND WASHING LIKE THAT THEY WANT THE WASHING MACHINE IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY BUT WHEN I LECTURE TO ENVIRONMENTALLY CONCERNED STUDENTS
HansRosling_2010W THEY TELL ME NO EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD CANNOT HAVE CARS AND WASHING MACHINES
HansRosling_2010W HOW CAN WE TELL THIS WOMAN THAT SHE AIN 'T GOING TO HAVE A WASHING MACHINE
HansRosling_2010W THIS GROUP USES THREE ONE EACH AND THEY ALSO HAVE ELECTRICITY AND OVER THERE THEY DON 'T EVEN USE ONE EACH THAT MAKES TWELVE OF THEM BUT THE MAIN CONCERN FOR THE ENVIRONMENTALLY INTERESTED STUDENTS AND THEY ARE RIGHT IS ABOUT THE FUTURE
HansRosling_2010W WHAT ARE THE TRENDS IF WE JUST PROLONG THE TRENDS WITHOUT ANY REAL ADVANCED ANALYSIS TO TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTY THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT CAN INCREASE THE ENERGY USE FIRST POPULATION GROWTH SECOND ECONOMIC GROWTH
HansRosling_2010W THE BEST OF HERE IN THE EMERGING ECONOMIES I CALL THEM THE NEW EAST THEY WILL JUMP THE AIR LINE WOPP THEY WILL SAY AND THEY WILL START TO USE AS MUCH AS THE OLD WEST ARE DOING ALREADY
HansRosling_2010W STILL THE RICHEST PEOPLE USE MOST OF IT
HansRosling_2010W SO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BECAUSE
HansRosling_2010W THE RISK THE HIGH PROBABILITY OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL IT 'S REAL OF COURSE THEY MUST BE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT
HansRosling_2010W THEY MUST CHANGE BEHAVIOR IN SOME WAY THEY MUST ALSO START TO PRODUCE GREEN ENERGY MUCH MORE GREEN ENERGY BUT UNTIL THEY HAVE THE SAME ENERGY CONSUMPTION PER PERSON THEY SHOULDN 'T GIVE ADVICE TO OTHERS WHAT TO DO AND WHAT NOT TO DO
HansRosling_2010W MORE GREEN ENERGY ALL OVER THIS IS WHAT WE HOPE MAY HAPPEN IT 'S A REAL CHALLENGE IN THE FUTURE
HansRosling_2010W BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS WOMAN IN THE FAVELA IN RIO SHE WANTS A WASHING MACHINE SHE 'S VERY HAPPY ABOUT HER MINISTER OF ENERGY THAT PROVIDED ELECTRICITY TO EVERYONE SO HAPPY THAT SHE EVEN VOTED FOR HER AND SHE
HansRosling_2010W WE HAVE LOADED THE LAUNDRY THE MACHINE WILL MAKE THE WORK AND NOW WE CAN GO TO THE LIBRARY BECAUSE THIS IS THE MAGIC YOU LOAD THE LAUNDRY AND WHAT DO YOU GET OUT OF THE MACHINE YOU GET BOOKS
HansRosling_2010W AND SHE ALSO GOT BOOKS FOR HERSELF SHE MANAGED TO STUDY ENGLISH AND LEARN THAT AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE AND SHE READ SO MANY NOVELS SO MANY DIFFERENT NOVELS HERE
HansRosling_2010W AND WHAT WE SAID MY MOTHER AND ME THANK YOU INDUSTRIALIZATION THANK YOU STEEL MILL
