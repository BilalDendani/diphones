BruceMcCall_2008P I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL I'M DOING HERE
BruceMcCall_2008P AND I PAINT ON PAPER USING GOUACHE WHICH HASN'T CHANGED IN SIX HUNDRED YEARS
BruceMcCall_2008P BUT
BruceMcCall_2008P ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO I HAD AN ART SHOW IN NEW YORK AND I TITLED IT SERIOUS NONSENSE SO I THINK I'M ACTUALLY THE FIRST ONE HERE
BruceMcCall_2008P I LEAD I CALLED IT SERIOUS NONSENSE BECAUSE ON THE SERIOUS SIDE I USE A TECHNIQUE OF PAINSTAKING REALISM
BruceMcCall_2008P OF EDITORIAL ILLUSTRATION FROM WHEN I WAS A KID I COPIED IT AND I NEVER UNLEARNED IT IT'S THE ONLY STYLE I KNOW AND IT'S VERY KIND OF STAID AND FORMAL
BruceMcCall_2008P AND MEANWHILE I USE NONSENSE AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS A SCOTTISH CASTLE WHERE PEOPLE ARE PLAYING GOLF INDOORS AND
BruceMcCall_2008P THE TRICK WAS TO BANG THE GOLF BALL OFF A SUITS OF ARMOR WHICH YOU CAN'T SEE THERE THIS WAS ONE OF A SERIES CALLED ZANY AFTERNOONS WHICH BECAME A BOOK THIS IS A HOME BUILT ROCKET PROPELLED
BruceMcCall_2008P I WORK A LOT IN WHAT I CALL RETROFUTURISM WHICH IS LOOKING BACK TO SEE HOW YESTERDAY VIEWED TOMORROW
BruceMcCall_2008P AND THEY'RE ALWAYS WRONG ALWAYS HILARIOUSLY OPTIMISTICALLY WRONG
BruceMcCall_2008P AND THE PEAK TIME FOR THAT WAS THE THIRTIES BECAUSE THE DEPRESSION WAS SO DISMAL THAT ANYTHING TO GET AWAY FROM THE PRESENT INTO THE FUTURE AND TECHNOLOGY WAS GOING TO CARRY US ALONG
BruceMcCall_2008P THIS IS POPULAR WORKBENCH POPULAR SCIENCE MAGAZINES IN THOSE DAYS I HAD A HUGE COLLECTION OF THEM FROM THE THIRTIES ALL THEY ARE JUST POOR PEOPLE BEING ASKED TO MAKE SUNGLASSES OUT OF WIRE COAT HANGERS AND EVERYTHING IMPROVISED AND DREAMING ABOUT THESE WONDERFUL
BruceMcCall_2008P GIANT RADIO ROBOTS PLAYING ICE HOCKEY AT THREE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR IT A S ALL GOING TO HAPPEN IT A S ALL GOING TO BE WONDERFUL AUTOMOTIVE RETROFUTURISM IS
BruceMcCall_2008P ONE OF MY SPECIALTIES I WAS BOTH AN AUTOMOBILE ILLUSTRATOR AND AN ADVERTISING AUTOMOBILE COPYWRITER SO I HAVE A LOT OF REVENGE TO TAKE ON THE SUBJECT
BruceMcCall_2008P MY TEETH TECHNO ARCHAEOLOGY IS DIGGING BACK AND FINDING PAST MIRACLES THAT NEVER HAPPENED FOR GOOD REASON USUALLY THE ZEPPELIN THIS WAS FROM A BROCHURE ABOUT
BruceMcCall_2008P BASED OBVIOUSLY ON THE HINDENBURG BUT THE ZEPPELIN WAS THE BIGGEST THING THAT EVER MOVED MADE BY MAN AND IT CARRIED FIFTY SIX PEOPLE AT THE SPEED OF A BUICK
BruceMcCall_2008P AT AN ALTITUDE YOU COULD HEAR DOGS BARK AND IT COST TWICE AS MUCH AS A FIRST CLASS CABIN ON THE NORMANDIE TO FLY IT SO THE
BruceMcCall_2008P WAS INEVITABLE IT WAS GOING TO GO THIS IS AUTO GYRO JOUSTING IN MALIBU IN THE THIRTIES THE AUTO GYRO
BruceMcCall_2008P COULDN'T WAIT FOR THE INVENTION OF THE HELICOPTER BUT IT SHOULD HAVE IT WASN'T A BIG SUCCESS IT'S THE ONLY SPANISH INNOVATION TECHNOLOGICALLY OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY BY THE WAY
BruceMcCall_2008P NEEDED TO KNOW THAT
BruceMcCall_2008P MOST USELESS HUMAN EMOTION SO I THINK THAT A S A CASE FOR SERIOUS PLAY

BruceMcCall_2008P HAPPY LITTLE STORY ISN'T IT THIS IS MOTOR RITZ TOWERS IN MANHATTAN IN THE THIRTIES WHERE YOU DROVE UP TO YOUR FRONT DOOR IF YOU HAD THE
BruceMcCall_2008P FOND MEMORY OF TIMES PAST HYPERBOLIC OVERKILL IS A WAY OF TAKING EXAGGERATION TO THE ABSOLUTE
BruceMcCall_2008P ULTIMATE LIMIT JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT
