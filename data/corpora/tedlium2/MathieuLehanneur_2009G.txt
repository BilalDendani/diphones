MathieuLehanneur_2009G A WEIRD FREAK WITH HUGE HANDS HUGE MOUTH AND A TINY BOTTOM
MathieuLehanneur_2009G ACTUALLY THIS CREATURE IS THE RESULT OF THE PENFIELD RESEARCH HE NAMED IT HOMUNCULUS BASICALLY THE HOMUNCULUS IS THE VISUALIZATION OF A HUMAN BEING WHERE
MathieuLehanneur_2009G EACH PART OF THE BODY IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE SURFACE IT TAKES IN THE BRAIN SO OF COURSE HOMUNCULUS IS DEFINITELY NOT
MathieuLehanneur_2009G IT'S YOU IT'S ME IT'S OUR INVISIBLE REALITY THIS VISUALIZATION COULD EXPLAIN FOR EXAMPLE WHY NEWBORNS OR SMOKERS PUT INSTINCTIVELY THEIR FINGERS IN THE
MathieuLehanneur_2009G SO ANYWAY EVEN IF I DO NOT UNDERSTAND SCIENCE ENTIRELY FOR MY DESIGN I ESSENTIALLY REFER TO IT I'M FASCINATED BY ITS ABILITY TO DEEPLY INVESTIGATE THE HUMAN BEING ITS WAY OF WORKING ITS WAY OF FEELING
MathieuLehanneur_2009G AND IT REALLY HELPS ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE SEE HOW WE HEAR HOW WE BREATHE HOW OUR BRAIN CAN INFORM OR MISLEAD US
MathieuLehanneur_2009G IT'S A GREAT TOOL FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT COULD BE OUR REAL NEEDS
MathieuLehanneur_2009G AND SCIENTISTS AMIDST COMPLEXITY AMIDST FLUCTUATION AND UNIQUENESS WHAT COULD BE OUR REAL NEEDS MAYBE THE
MathieuLehanneur_2009G IN OUR DAILY LIFE WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY DISTURBED BY AGGRESSIVE SOUNDS AND YOU KNOW ALL THOSE KIND OF SOUND PUTS US IN A KIND OF
MathieuLehanneur_2009G AND PREVENT US FROM BEING QUIET AND FOCUSED SO I WANTED TO CREATE A KIND OF SOUND
MathieuLehanneur_2009G SO I WORKED WITH WHITE NOISE D B IS BASICALLY D B IS THE NAME OF THE PRODUCT BASICALLY A WHITE NOISE DIFFUSER
MathieuLehanneur_2009G AND THIS NOISE IS THE MOST NEUTRAL IT IS THE PERFECT SOUND FOR OUR EARS AND OUR BRAIN SO WHEN YOU HEAR THIS SOUND YOU FEEL LIKE A KIND OF
MathieuLehanneur_2009G SHELTER PRESERVED FROM NOISE POLLUTION AND WHEN YOU HEAR THE WHITE NOISE YOUR BRAIN IS IMMEDIATELY FOCUSED ON IT
MathieuLehanneur_2009G AND DO NOT BE DISTURBED ANY MORE BY THE OTHER AGGRESSIVE SOUND IT SEEMS TO BE MAGIC BUT IT IS JUST PHYSIOLOGY IT'S JUST IN YOUR BRAIN AND IN MINE I HOPE
MathieuLehanneur_2009G SO
MathieuLehanneur_2009G WHITE NOISE A LITTLE BIT ACTIVE AND REACTIVE I CREATE A BALL A ROLLING BALL ABLE TO
MathieuLehanneur_2009G FEEL THE AFFECT OF THE WHITE NOISE
MathieuLehanneur_2009G A LOVING DISPUTE WITH YOUR GIRL OR BOYFRIEND YOU SHOUT YOU SAY BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH WHO IS THIS GUY AND D B WILL PROBABLY ROLL TOWARD YOU AND TURNING AROUND YOU IS
MathieuLehanneur_2009G SO YOU WOULD PROBABLY SHUT IT AT THIS POINT
MathieuLehanneur_2009G ANYWAY IN THIS SAME KIND OF APPROACH I DESIGNED K K IS A DAYLIGHT RECEIVER TRANSMITTER
MathieuLehanneur_2009G SO THIS OBJECT IS SUPPOSED TO BE DISPLAYED ON YOUR DESK OR ON YOUR PIANO WHERE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO SPEND MOST OF YOUR TIME IN THE DAY
MathieuLehanneur_2009G AND THIS OBJECT WILL BE ABLE TO KNOW EXACTLY THE QUANTITY OF LIGHT YOU RECEIVE DURING THE DAY AND ABLE TO GIVE YOU THE QUANTITY OF LIGHT YOU NEED
MathieuLehanneur_2009G THIS OBJECT IS COMPLETELY COVERED BY FIBER OPTICALS AND THE IDEA OF THOSE FIBER OPTICALS IS TO INFORM THE OBJECT FOR SURE BUT CREATES THE IDEA OF AN EYE SENSIBILITY
MathieuLehanneur_2009G OF THE OBJECT I WANT BY THIS DESIGN FEEL WHEN YOU SEE IT YOU SEE INSTINCTIVELY THIS OBJECT SEEMS TO BE
MathieuLehanneur_2009G VERY SENSITIVE VERY REACTIVE AND THIS OBJECT KNOW BETTER THAN YOU AND PROBABLY BEFORE YOU WHAT YOU REALLY NEED
MathieuLehanneur_2009G YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT THE LACK OF DAYLIGHT CAN PROVOKE SOME PROBLEM OF ENERGY OR PROBLEM OF LIBIDO SO A HUGE PROBLEM
MathieuLehanneur_2009G MOST OF THE PROJECTS I WORK ON I LIVE IN CALIBRATION WITH SCIENTISTS I'M JUST A DESIGNER SO I NEED THEM SO THERE CAN BE SOME BIOLOGISTS PSYCHIATRISTS MATHEMATICIANS AND SO ON AND I SUBMIT THEM MY
MathieuLehanneur_2009G AND THIS KIND OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DESIGNER AND SCIENTIST START WHEN I WAS AT SCHOOL EARLY IN MY STUDIES I WAS GUINEA PIG FOR PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY
MathieuLehanneur_2009G AND THE IRONY FOR ME WAS OF COURSE I DIDN'T DO THAT FOR THE SAKE OF SCIENCE PROGRESS I JUST DO THAT TO MAKE MONEY
MathieuLehanneur_2009G ANYWAY THIS PROJECT OR THIS EXPERIENCE MAKE ME START A NEW PROJECT ON THE DESIGN OF MEDICINE YOU
MathieuLehanneur_2009G HAVE TO KNOW THAT TODAY ROUGHLY ONE OR TWO EVERY DRUG PILLS IS NOT TAKEN CORRECTLY SO EVEN
MathieuLehanneur_2009G I WANTED TO CREATE NEW KIND OF MEDICINE IN ORDER TO CREATE A NEW KIND OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PATIENT AND THE TREATMENT SO I TURNED NORMAL PILLS INTO THIS I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLE
MathieuLehanneur_2009G THIS ONE IS AN ANTIBIOTIC AND ITS PURPOSE IS TO HELP PATIENT TO GO TO THE END OF THE TREATMENT AND THE CONCEPT IS TO
MathieuLehanneur_2009G CREATE A KIND OF ONION A KIND OF STRUCTURE IN LAYERS SO YOU START WITH THE DARKEST ONE AND
MathieuLehanneur_2009G YOU ARE HELPED TO VISUALIZE THE DURATION OF THE TREATMENT AND YOU ARE HELPED TO VISUALIZE THE DECREASE OF THE INFECTION SO THE FIRST DAY THIS IS THE BIG ONE AND
MathieuLehanneur_2009G YOU HAVE TO PEEL AND EAT ONE LAYER A DAY AND YOUR ANTIBIOTIC GOES SMALLER AND CLEARER AND YOU'RE WAITING FOR RECOVERY AS YOU WERE WAITING FOR THE CHRISTMAS DAY AND YOU FOLLOW THE TREATMENT LIKE THAT
MathieuLehanneur_2009G TO THE END OF THE TREATMENT AND HERE YOU CAN GET THE WHITE CORE AND IT MEANS RIGHT YOU ARE IN THE RECOVERY
MathieuLehanneur_2009G THANK YOU
MathieuLehanneur_2009G THIS ONE IS A THIRD LUNG A PHARMACEUTICAL DEVICE FOR LONG TERM ASTHMA TREATMENT I DESIGNED TO HELP KIDS TO FOLLOWING THE TREATMENT
MathieuLehanneur_2009G SO THE IDEA OF THIS ONE IS TO CREATE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PATIENT OF THE TREATMENT BUT A RELATIONSHIP OF DEPENDENCY BUT IN THIS CASE IT IS NOT THE MEDICATION THAT IS DEPENDENT ON THE PATIENT
MathieuLehanneur_2009G THIS IS THE KIDS WILL FEEL THE THERAPEUTIC OBJECT NEED HIM SO THE IDEA IS
MathieuLehanneur_2009G ALL NIGHT LONG THE ELASTIC SKIN OF THE THIRD LUNG WILL SLOWLY INFLATE ITSELF INCLUDING AIR AND MOLECULES FOR SURE
MathieuLehanneur_2009G AND WHEN THE KIDS WAKE UP HE CAN SEE THE OBJECT NEED HIM AND HE TAKE HIM TO HIS MOUTH AND BREATH THE AIR IT CONTAINS SO
MathieuLehanneur_2009G THE KID TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF IS TO TAKE CARE OF THIS LIVING OBJECT AND HE DO NOT FEELS ANYMORE IT'S RELIES ON ASTHMA TREATMENT AS THE ASTHMA TREATMENT NEEDS HIM
MathieuLehanneur_2009G OF LIVING OBJECT APPROACH I LIKE THE IDEA OF A KIND OF INVISIBLE DESIGN AS IF THE FUNCTION OF THE OBJECT
MathieuLehanneur_2009G EXISTS IN A KIND OF INVISIBLE FIELD JUST AROUND THE OBJECTS THEMSELVES WE COULD TALK ABOUT A KIND OF SOUL OF
MathieuLehanneur_2009G A GHOST COMPELLING THEM AND ALMOST A KIND OF POLTERGEIST EFFECT SO WHEN A PASSIVE OBJECT LIKE THIS ONE SEEMS TO BE ALIVE BECAUSE IT IS STARTING TO MOVE
MathieuLehanneur_2009G AND THE IDEA WAS TO CREATE SOME SELF MOVING BENCHES IN THE MAIN EXHIBITION ROOM SO THE LIVING BENCHES WOULD BE EXACTLY LIKE THE BALL AND JOHN WAS SO EXCITED BY THIS IDEA
MathieuLehanneur_2009G OKAY LET 'S GO I REMEMBER THE DAY OF THE OPENING I WAS A LITTLE BIT LATE WHEN I BRING THE TEN LIVING
MathieuLehanneur_2009G AND SELF MOVING BENCHES IN THE EXHIBITION ROOM JOHN WAS JUST
MathieuLehanneur_2009G IT WOULD BE A GREAT HONOR A GREAT COMPLIMENT FOR ME IF HE HADN'T DECIDED TO TAKE ALL THEM OFF TWO HOUR BEFORE THE OPENING SO
MathieuLehanneur_2009G I GUESS YOU WON 'T BE SURPRISED IF I TELL YOU THAT PINOCCHIO IS ONE OF MY GREAT INFLUENCES PINOCCHIO IS PROBABLY ONE OF MY BEST DESIGN
MathieuLehanneur_2009G MY FAVORITE ONE BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF OBJECT WITH A CONSCIENCE ABLE TO BE MODIFIED BY ITS SURROUNDINGS AND ABLE TO MODIFY IT AS WELL
MathieuLehanneur_2009G THE OTHER GREAT INFLUENCE IS THE MINE 'S CANARY IN COAL MINES THIS CANARY WAS SUPPOSED TO
MathieuLehanneur_2009G BE CLOSE TO THE MINERS AND IT WAS SINGING ALL DAY LONG AND WHEN IT STOPS IT MEANS THAT IT JUST DIED SO THIS CANARY WAS
MathieuLehanneur_2009G LEAVING ALARM AND VERY EFFICIENT ONE A VERY NATURAL TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER TO SAY TO THE MINERS THE AIR IS TOO BAD YOU HAVE TO GO IT'S AN
MathieuLehanneur_2009G SO IT 'S FOR ME A GREAT PRODUCT AND I TRIED TO DESIGN A KIND OF CANARY ANDREA IS ONE ANDREA IS A
MathieuLehanneur_2009G TOXIC GASSES FROM AIR CONTAMINATED INDOOR AIR SO IT USES SOME PLANTS TO DO THIS JOB SELECTED FOR THEIR GAS FILTERING ABILITY
MathieuLehanneur_2009G YOU HAVE TO KNOW OR YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW THAT INDOOR AIR POLLUTION IS MORE TOXIC THAN OUTDOOR ONE SO WHILE I'M TALKING TO YOU
MathieuLehanneur_2009G THE SEAT YOU ARE SIT ON ARE CURRENTLY EMITTING SOME INVISIBLE AND ODORLESS TOXIC GAS SORRY FOR THAT
MathieuLehanneur_2009G SO YOU ARE CURRENTLY BREATHING FORMALDEHYDE IT'S THE SAME FOR ME
MathieuLehanneur_2009G YOUR SOFA YOUR PLASTIC CHAIR YOUR KID 'S TOYS GIVE THEIR OWN INVISIBLE REALITY
MathieuLehanneur_2009G AND THIS ONE IS VERY TOXIC THIS IS THE REASON WHY I CREATED WITH DAVID EDWARD A SCIENTIST OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY AN OBJECT ABLE TO ABSORB THE TOXIC
MathieuLehanneur_2009G THE ROOTS OF THE PLANT ARE NOT VERY EFFECTIVE BILL WOLVERTON FROM NASA ANALYZED IT CLEVERLY IN SEVENTIES
MathieuLehanneur_2009G SO THE IDEA IS TO CREATE AN OBJECT ABLE TO FORCE THE AIR AND TO BE IN CONTACT AT THE RIGHT SPEED AT THE RIGHT PLACE IN ALL THE EFFECTIVE PART OF THE PLANT SO THIS IS THE FINAL OBJECT IT WILL BE LAUNCH NEXT SEPTEMBER
MathieuLehanneur_2009G THIS ONE IS
MathieuLehanneur_2009G THE IDEA OF THIS OBJECT IS TO BE ABLE TO GET AT HOME VERY LOCAL FOOD THE
MathieuLehanneur_2009G USED TO GET FOOD TAKEN IN A RADIUS OF ONE HUNDRED MILES LOCAL RIVER IS ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU FOOD DIRECTLY IN YOUR LIVING ROOM
MathieuLehanneur_2009G SO THE PRINCIPLE OF THIS OBJECT IS TO CREATE AN ECOSYSTEM CALLED AQUAPONICS AND THE AQUAPONICS IS THE DIRTY WATER OF THE FISH BY A WATER PUMP FEEDS THE PLANTS ABOVE
MathieuLehanneur_2009G AND THE PLANTS WILL FILTER BY THE ROOTS THE DIRTY WATER OF THE FISH AFTER IT GOES BACK INTO THE FISH
MathieuLehanneur_2009G AFTER THAT YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS OR YOU SIT DOWN IN FRONT OF IT LIKE YOU WOULD DO IN FRONT YOUR TV SET AMAZING CHANNEL
MathieuLehanneur_2009G OR YOU START FISHING AND YOU MAKE SOME SUSHIS WITH A FISH AND THE AROMATIC PLANTS
MathieuLehanneur_2009G BECAUSE YOU CAN GROW SOME POTATOES NO NOT POTATOES BUT TOMATOES AROMATIC PLANTS AND SO ON SO NOW WE CAN BREATH SAFELY NOW WE CAN
MathieuLehanneur_2009G LOCAL FOOD NOW WE CAN BE TREATED BY SMART MEDICINE NOW WE CAN BE WELL BALANCED IN OUR BIORHYTHM WITH DAYLIGHT BUT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO CREATE A PERFECT PLACE SO I TRIED TO
MathieuLehanneur_2009G IN ORDER TO WORK AND CREATE SO I DESIGNED FOR AN AMERICAN SCIENTIST BASED IN PARIS A VERY STIMULATIVE
MathieuLehanneur_2009G YOU DO NOT WORK ANYMORE AT YOUR DESK LIKE A POLITICIAN YOUR SEAT YOUR SLEEP AND YOUR PLAY ON A BIG GEODESIC ISLAND MADE OF LEATHER
MathieuLehanneur_2009G SEE LIKE THIS ONE IN THIS OFFICE YOU DO NOT WORK AND WRITE AND DRAW ON A SHEET OF PAPER BUT YOU DRAW DIRECTLY ON A KIND OF HUGE WHITEBOARD CAVE LIKE A
MathieuLehanneur_2009G SCIENTIST SO YOU LIKE THAT CAN MAKE SOME SPORT DURING YOUR WORK IN THIS OFFICE
MathieuLehanneur_2009G YOU DO NOT NEED TO GO OUT IN ORDER TO BE IN CONTACT WITH NATURE YOU INCLUDE DIRECTLY THE NATURE IN THE FLOOR OF THE OFFICE
MathieuLehanneur_2009G THIS IS AN INSPIRATION IMAGE TO LEAD THIS PROJECT OF THE OFFICE IT REALLY HELPED ME TO DESIGN IT I NEVER SHOW IT TO MY CLIENT HE WOULD BE SO OFFENDED JUST FOR MY WORKSHOP
MathieuLehanneur_2009G I GUESS IT MAY BE THE REVENGE OF THE GUINEA PIG I WAS BUT IT'S MAYBE THE CONVICTION AS
MathieuLehanneur_2009G MONKEY AND HOMUNCULUS WE ARE ALL OF US NEED TO BE CONSIDERED ACCORDING TO OUR REAL NATURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
