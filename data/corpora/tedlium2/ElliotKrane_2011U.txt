ElliotKrane_2011U AND I 'M AN ACADEMIC SO I PUT AUDIENCES TO SLEEP FOR FREE
ElliotKrane_2011U BUT WHAT I ACTUALLY MOSTLY DO IS I MANAGE THE PAIN MANAGEMENT SERVICE AT THE PACKARD CHILDREN 'S HOSPITAL UP AT STANFORD IN PALO ALTO AND IT 'S FROM THE EXPERIENCE FROM ABOUT TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF DOING THAT THAT I WANT TO BRING TO YOU THE MESSAGE THIS MORNING THAT PAIN IS A DISEASE
ElliotKrane_2011U NOW MOST OF THE TIME YOU THINK OF PAIN AS A SYMPTOM OF A DISEASE AND THAT 'S TRUE MOST OF THE TIME IT 'S THE SYMPTOM OF A TUMOR OR AN INFECTION OR AN INFLAMMATION OR AN OPERATION
ElliotKrane_2011U BUT ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THE TIME AFTER THE PATIENT HAS RECOVERED FROM ONE OF THOSE EVENTS PAIN PERSISTS IT PERSISTS FOR MONTHS AND OFTENTIMES FOR YEARS AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT IS ITS OWN DISEASE
ElliotKrane_2011U AND BEFORE I TELL YOU ABOUT HOW IT IS THAT WE THINK THAT HAPPENS AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT I WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW IT FEELS FOR MY PATIENTS SO IMAGINE IF YOU WILL THAT I 'M STROKING YOUR ARM WITH THIS FEATHER AS I 'M STROKING MY ARM RIGHT NOW
ElliotKrane_2011U NOW I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE THAT I 'M STROKING IT WITH THIS PLEASE
ElliotKrane_2011U A VERY DIFFERENT FEELING NOW WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH CHRONIC PAIN
ElliotKrane_2011U IMAGINE IF YOU WILL THESE TWO IDEAS TOGETHER IMAGINE WHAT YOUR LIFE WOULD BE LIKE
ElliotKrane_2011U IF I WERE TO STROKE IT WITH THIS FEATHER BUT YOUR BRAIN WAS TELLING YOU THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE FEELING AND THAT IS THE EXPERIENCE OF MY PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN
ElliotKrane_2011U IN FACT IMAGINE SOMETHING EVEN WORSE IMAGINE I WERE TO STROKE YOUR CHILD 'S ARM WITH THIS FEATHER AND THEIR BRAIN WAS TELLING THEM THAT THEY WERE FEELING THIS HOT TORCH
ElliotKrane_2011U THAT WAS THE EXPERIENCE OF MY PATIENT CHANDLER WHOM YOU SEE IN THE PHOTOGRAPH AS YOU CAN SEE SHE 'S A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN SHE WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD LAST YEAR WHEN I MET HER AND SHE ASPIRED TO BE A PROFESSIONAL DANCER AND DURING THE COURSE OF ONE OF HER DANCE REHEARSALS SHE FELL ON HER OUTSTRETCHED ARM AND SPRAINED HER WRIST
ElliotKrane_2011U NOW YOU WOULD PROBABLY IMAGINE AS SHE DID THAT A WRIST SPRAIN IS A TRIVIAL EVENT IN A PERSON 'S LIFE WRAP IT IN AN ACE BANDAGE TAKE SOME IBUPROFEN FOR A WEEK OR TWO AND THAT 'S THE END OF THE STORY BUT IN CHANDLER 'S CASE THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY
ElliotKrane_2011U THIS IS WHAT HER ARM LOOKED LIKE WHEN SHE CAME TO MY CLINIC ABOUT THREE MONTHS AFTER HER SPRAIN
ElliotKrane_2011U YOU CAN SEE THAT THE ARM IS DISCOLORED PURPLISH IN COLOR IT WAS CADAVERICALLY COLD TO THE TOUCH THE MUSCLES WERE FROZEN PARALYZED DYSTONIC IS HOW WE REFER TO THAT
ElliotKrane_2011U THE PAIN HAD SPREAD FROM HER WRIST TO HER HANDS TO HER FINGERTIPS FROM HER WRIST UP TO HER ELBOW ALMOST ALL THE WAY TO HER SHOULDER BUT THE WORST PART WAS
ElliotKrane_2011U NOT THE SPONTANEOUS PAIN THAT WAS THERE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY THE WORST PART WAS THAT SHE HAD ALLODYNIA THE MEDICAL TERM FOR THE PHENOMENON THAT I JUST ILLUSTRATED WITH THE FEATHER AND WITH THE TORCH THE LIGHTEST TOUCH OF HER ARM
ElliotKrane_2011U THE TOUCH OF A HAND THE TOUCH EVEN OF A SLEEVE OF A GARMENT AS SHE PUT IT ON CAUSED EXCRUCIATING BURNING PAIN
ElliotKrane_2011U HOW CAN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM GET THIS SO WRONG HOW CAN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MISINTERPRET AN INNOCENT SENSATION LIKE THE TOUCH OF A HAND AND TURN IT INTO THE MALEVOLENT SENSATION OF THE TOUCH OF THE FLAME
ElliotKrane_2011U WELL YOU PROBABLY IMAGINE THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IN THE BODY IS HARDWIRED LIKE YOUR HOUSE
ElliotKrane_2011U IN YOUR HOUSE WIRES RUN IN THE WALL FROM THE LIGHT SWITCH TO A JUNCTION BOX IN THE CEILING AND FROM THE JUNCTION BOX TO THE LIGHT BULB AND WHEN YOU TURN THE SWITCH ON THE LIGHT GOES ON AND WHEN YOU TURN THE SWITCH OFF THE LIGHT GOES OFF SO PEOPLE IMAGINE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS JUST LIKE THAT
ElliotKrane_2011U IF YOU HIT YOUR THUMB WITH A HAMMER THESE WIRES IN YOUR ARM THAT OF COURSE WE CALL NERVES TRANSMIT THE INFORMATION INTO THE JUNCTION BOX IN THE SPINAL CORD WHERE NEW WIRES NEW NERVES TAKE THE INFORMATION UP TO THE BRAIN WHERE YOU BECOME CONSCIOUSLY AWARE THAT YOUR THUMB IS NOW HURT
ElliotKrane_2011U BUT THE SITUATION OF COURSE IN THE HUMAN BODY IS FAR MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT
ElliotKrane_2011U INSTEAD OF IT BEING THE CASE THAT THAT JUNCTION BOX IN THE SPINAL CORD IS JUST SIMPLE WHERE ONE NERVE CONNECTS WITH THE NEXT NERVE
ElliotKrane_2011U BY RELEASING THESE LITTLE BROWN PACKETS OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION CALLED NEUROTRANSMITTERS IN A LINEAR ONE ON ONE FASHION IN FACT WHAT HAPPENS IS THE NEUROTRANSMITTERS SPILL OUT IN THREE DIMENSIONS LATERALLY VERTICALLY UP AND DOWN IN THE SPINAL CORD AND THEY START INTERACTING WITH OTHER ADJACENT CELLS
ElliotKrane_2011U THESE CELLS CALLED GLIAL CELLS
ElliotKrane_2011U THESE GLIAL CELLS BECOME ACTIVATED THEIR DNA STARTS TO SYNTHESIZE NEW PROTEINS WHICH SPILL OUT AND INTERACT WITH ADJACENT NERVES AND THEY START RELEASING THEIR NEUROTRANSMITTERS AND THOSE NEUROTRANSMITTERS SPILL OUT AND ACTIVATE ADJACENT GLIAL CELLS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH UNTIL WHAT WE HAVE IS A POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP
ElliotKrane_2011U THAT 'S CRAZY BUT THAT 'S IN FACT WHAT HAPPENS WITH CHRONIC PAIN AND THAT 'S WHY PAIN BECOMES ITS OWN DISEASE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM HAS PLASTICITY IT CHANGES AND IT MORPHS IN RESPONSE TO STIMULI WELL WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THAT WHAT CAN WE DO IN A CASE LIKE CHANDLER 'S
ElliotKrane_2011U WE TREAT THESE PATIENTS IN A RATHER CRUDE FASHION AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE TREAT THEM WITH SYMPTOM MODIFYING DRUGS PAINKILLERS WHICH ARE FRANKLY NOT VERY EFFECTIVE FOR THIS KIND OF PAIN
ElliotKrane_2011U WE TAKE NERVES THAT ARE NOISY AND ACTIVE THAT SHOULD BE QUIET
ElliotKrane_2011U AND WE PUT THEM TO SLEEP WITH LOCAL ANESTHETICS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT WE DO IS WE USE A RIGOROUS AND OFTEN UNCOMFORTABLE PROCESS OF PHYSICAL THERAPY AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY TO RETRAIN THE NERVES IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM TO RESPOND NORMALLY
ElliotKrane_2011U TO THE ACTIVITIES AND SENSORY EXPERIENCES THAT ARE PART OF EVERYDAY LIFE
ElliotKrane_2011U AND WE SUPPORT ALL OF THAT WITH AN INTENSIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY PROGRAM TO ADDRESS THE DESPONDENCY DESPAIR AND DEPRESSION THAT ALWAYS ACCOMPANIES SEVERE CHRONIC PAIN
ElliotKrane_2011U IT 'S SUCCESSFUL AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS VIDEO OF CHANDLER WHO TWO MONTHS AFTER WE FIRST MET HER IS NOW DOINGS A BACK FLIP AND I HAD LUNCH WITH HER YESTERDAY BECAUSE SHE 'S A COLLEGE STUDENT STUDYING DANCE AT LONG BEACH HERE AND SHE 'S DOING ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC
ElliotKrane_2011U BUT THE FUTURE IS ACTUALLY EVEN BRIGHTER THE FUTURE HOLDS THE PROMISE THAT NEW DRUGS WILL BE DEVELOPED
ElliotKrane_2011U THAT ARE NOT SYMPTOM MODIFYING DRUGS THAT SIMPLY MASK THE PROBLEM AS WE HAVE NOW
ElliotKrane_2011U BUT THAT WILL BE DISEASE MODIFYING DRUGS THAT WILL ACTUALLY GO RIGHT TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM AND ATTACK THOSE GLIAL CELLS OR THOSE PERNICIOUS PROTEINS THAT THE GLIAL CELLS ELABORATE
ElliotKrane_2011U THAT SPILL OVER AND CAUSE THIS CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM WIND UP OR PLASTICITY THAT SO IS CAPABLE OF DISTORTING AND AMPLIFYING THE SENSORY EXPERIENCE THAT WE CALL PAIN
ElliotKrane_2011U SO I HAVE HOPE THAT IN THE FUTURE THE PROPHETIC WORDS OF GEORGE CARLIN WILL BE REALIZED WHO SAID MY PHILOSOPHY NO PAIN
ElliotKrane_2011U NO PAIN
ElliotKrane_2011U THANK YOU VERY MUCH
