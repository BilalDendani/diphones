MaeJemison_2002 WHAT I WANT TO DO TODAY IS TO SPEND SOME TIME TALKING ABOUT SOME STUFF THAT'S SORT OF GIVEN ME A LITTLE BIT OF EXISTENTIAL ANGST FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD
MaeJemison_2002 THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND BASICALLY THESE THREE QUOTES TELL WHAT'S GOING ON WHEN GOD MADE THE COLOR PURPLE GOD WAS JUST SHOWING OFF ALICE WALKER WROTE IN THE COLOR PURPLE
MaeJemison_2002 AND ZORA NEALE HURSTON IN DUST TRACKS ON A ROAD RESEARCH IS A FORMALIZED CURIOSITY IT'S POKING AND PRYING WITH A PURPOSE
MaeJemison_2002 AND THEN FINALLY WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE NEAR FUTURE YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS ATTITUDE WELL WHATEVER HAPPENS HAPPENS
MaeJemison_2002 SO THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE CHESHIRE CAT SAYING IF YOU DON'T CARE MUCH WHERE YOU WANT TO GET TO IT DOESN'T MUCH MATTER WHICH WAY YOU GO BUT I THINK IT DOES MATTER WHICH WAY WE GO AND WHAT ROAD WE TAKE
MaeJemison_2002 THE WORLD OUR SOCIETY IS GOING TO BE BUILDING ON THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE AND ABSTRACT IDEAS THE DISCOVERIES THAT WE CAME UP WITH TODAY
MaeJemison_2002 JUST AS ALL THESE WONDERFUL THINGS WE'RE HEARING ABOUT HERE AT THE TED CONFERENCE THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW WERE REALLY KNOWLEDGE AND IDEAS THAT CAME UP IN THE FIFTIES THE SIXTIES AND THE SEVENTIES
MaeJemison_2002 THAT'S THE SUBSTRATE THAT WE'RE EXPLORING TODAY WHETHER IT'S THE INTERNET GENETIC ENGINEERING LASER SCANNERS GUIDED MISSILES FIBER OPTICS HIGH DEFINITION TELEVISION
MaeJemison_2002 ALVIN AILEY 'S SUITE OTIS OR SARAH JONES YOUR REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE BETWEEN THESE THIGHS WHICH BY THE WAY IS BANNED BY THE FCC OR SKA ALL OF THESE THINGS WITHOUT QUESTION
MaeJemison_2002 I'M REALLY WORRIED TO BE QUITE FRANK I'M CONCERNED I'M SKEPTICAL THAT WE'RE DOING VERY MUCH OF ANYTHING WE'RE IN A SENSE FAILING
MaeJemison_2002 TO ACT IN THE FUTURE WE ARE PURPOSEFULLY CONSCIOUSLY BEING LAGGARDS WE'RE LAGGING BEHIND
MaeJemison_2002 WHO WAS A PSYCHIATRIST FROM MARTINQUE SAID EACH GENERATION MUST OUT OF RELATIVE OBSCURITY DISCOVER ITS MISSION AND FULFILL OR BETRAY IT
MaeJemison_2002 WHAT IS OUR MISSION WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO I THINK OUR MISSION IS TO RECONCILE TO REINTEGRATE SCIENCE AND THE ARTS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S A SCHISM THAT EXISTS IN POPULAR CULTURE
MaeJemison_2002 YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE THIS IDEA THAT SCIENCE AND THE ARTS ARE REALLY SEPARATE WE THINK OF THEM AS SEPARATE AND DIFFERENT THINGS AND THIS IDEA WAS PROBABLY INTRODUCED CENTURIES AGO BUT IT'S REALLY BECOMING CRITICAL NOW
MaeJemison_2002 BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT OUR SOCIETY EVERY DAY THAT IF WE KEEP THINKING THAT THE ARTS ARE SEPARATE FROM THE SCIENCES
MaeJemison_2002 AND WE KEEP THINKING IT'S CUTE TO SAY I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ONE I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE OTHER ONE THEN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS NOW I KNOW NO ONE HERE AT TED THINKS THIS ALL OF US WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THEY'RE VERY CONNECTED BUT I'M GOING TO LET YOU KNOW THAT SOME FOLKS IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD
MaeJemison_2002 BELIEVE IT OR NOT THEY THINK IT'S NEAT WHEN THEY SAY YOU KNOW SCIENTISTS AND SCIENCE IS NOT CREATIVE MAYBE SCIENTISTS ARE INGENIOUS BUT THEY'RE NOT
MaeJemison_2002 AND THEN WE HAVE THIS TENDENCY THAT CAREER COUNSELORS AND VARIOUS PEOPLE SAY THINGS LIKE ARTISTS ARE NOT ANALYTICAL THEY'RE INGENIOUS PERHAPS
MaeJemison_2002 BUT NOT ANALYTICAL AND WHEN THESE CONCEPTS UNDERLIE OUR TEACHING AND WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THE WORLD THEN WE HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE STYMIE SUPPORT FOR EVERYTHING BY ACCEPTING THIS DICHOTOMY WHETHER IT'S
MaeJemison_2002 WHEN WE ATTEMPT TO ACCOMMODATE IT IN OUR WORLD AND WE TRY TO BUILD OUR FOUNDATION FOR THE WORLD WE'RE MESSING UP THE FUTURE BECAUSE WHO WANTS TO BE
MaeJemison_2002 WHO WANTS TO BE ILLOGICAL TALENT WOULD RUN FROM EITHER OF THESE FIELDS IF YOU SAID YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE EITHER THEN THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO SOMETHING WHERE THEY THINK WELL I CAN BE CREATIVE AND LOGICAL AT THE SAME TIME NOW I GREW UP IN THE SIXTIES AND I'LL ADMIT IT
MaeJemison_2002 OLD ENOUGH TO BE A HIPPIE I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE YOU KNOW THE YOUNGER GENERATION OF WANNA BE HIPPIES
MaeJemison_2002 WAS THAT THERE WAS HOPE FOR THE FUTURE WE THOUGHT EVERYONE COULD PARTICIPATE THERE
MaeJemison_2002 WONDERFUL INCREDIBLE IDEAS THAT WERE ALWAYS PERCOLATING AND SO MUCH OF WHAT'S COOL OR HOT TODAY IS REALLY BASED ON SOME OF THOSE CONCEPTS WHETHER IT'S PEOPLE TRYING TO USE A PRIME DIRECTIVE FROM STAR TREK BEING
MaeJemison_2002 THAT THREE DIMENSIONAL WEAVING AND FAX MACHINES THAT I READ ABOUT IN MY WEEKLY READERS AS THE TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING WAS JUST GETTING STARTED BUT THE SIXTIES LEFT ME WITH A PROBLEM
MaeJemison_2002 YOU SEE I
MaeJemison_2002 ALWAYS ASSUMED I WOULD GO INTO SPACE BECAUSE I FOLLOWED ALL OF THIS BUT I ALSO LOVED THE ARTS AND SCIENCES YOU SEE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AS A LITTLE GIRL AND A TEENAGER
MaeJemison_2002 I LOVED DESIGNING AND MAKING DOLL CLOTHES AND WANTED TO BE A FASHION DESIGNER I TOOK ART AND CERAMICS I LOVED DANCE LOLA FALANA ALVIN AILEY JEROME ROBINS
MaeJemison_2002 AND I ALSO AVIDLY FOLLOWED THE GEMINI AND THE APOLLO PROGRAMS I HAD SCIENCE PROJECTS AND
MaeJemison_2002 OF ASTRONOMY BOOKS I TOOK CALCULUS AND PHILOSOPHY I WONDERED ABOUT THE INFINITY AND THE BIG BANG THEORY AND WHEN I WAS AT STANFORD I FOUND MYSELF MY SENIOR YEAR
MaeJemison_2002 AND I FOUND MYSELF THE LAST QUARTER JUGGLING CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SEPARATION PROCESSES LOGIC CLASSES NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY
MaeJemison_2002 AND ALSO PRODUCING AND CHOREOGRAPHING A DANCE PRODUCTION AND I HAD TO DO THE LIGHTING AND THE DESIGN WORK
MaeJemison_2002 I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT DO I GO TO NEW YORK CITY TO TRY TO BECOME A PROFESSIONAL DANCER OR DO I GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL NOW MY MOTHER HELPED ME FIGURE THAT ONE OUT
MaeJemison_2002 THEIR SCIENCE AND MATH FOLKS ASK ME WHY DID YOU TAKE UP WHAT YOU TOOK UP I HAD TO SAY BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS HUMAN CREATIVITY
MaeJemison_2002 THE CREATIVITY THAT ALLOWED US THAT WE WERE REQUIRED TO HAVE TO CONCEIVE AND BUILD AND LAUNCH THE SPACE SHUTTLE SPRINGS FROM THE SAME SOURCE OF IMAGINATION AND ANALYSIS THAT IT TOOK TO CARVE A BUNDU STATUE
MaeJemison_2002 OR THE INGENUITY IT TOOK TO DESIGN CHOREOGRAPH AND STAGE CRY EACH ONE OF THEM ARE DIFFERENT MANIFESTATIONS INCARNATIONS OF CREATIVITY
MaeJemison_2002 AVATARS OF HUMAN CREATIVITY AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO RECONCILE IN OUR MINDS HOW THESE THINGS FIT TOGETHER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARTS AND SCIENCES IS NOT
MaeJemison_2002 EINSTEIN SAID IN FACT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING WE CAN EXPERIENCE IS THE MYSTERIOUS IT IS THE SOURCE OF ALL TRUE ART AND SCIENCE
MaeJemison_2002 DANCE REQUIRES US TO EXPRESS AND WANT TO EXPRESS THE JUBILATION IN LIFE BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT MOVEMENT DO I DO TO MAKE SURE THAT IT COMES ACROSS CORRECTLY
MaeJemison_2002 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARTS AND SCIENCES IS ALSO NOT CONSTRUCTIVE VERSUS DECONSTRUCTIVE RIGHT A LOT PEOPLE THINK OF THE SCIENCES AS DECONSTRUCTIVE YOU HAVE TO PULL THINGS APART
MaeJemison_2002 IS DECONSTRUCTIVE BECAUSE YOU SEE A PIECE AND YOU REMOVE WHAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE THERE BIOTECHNOLOGY IS CONSTRUCTIVE ORCHESTRAL ARRANGING IS CONSTRUCTIVE SO IN FACT WE USE CONSTRUCTIVE AND DECONSTRUCTIVE TECHNIQUES IN EVERYTHING
MaeJemison_2002 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SCIENCE AND THE ARTS IS NOT THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE SAME COIN EVEN OR EVEN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SAME CONTINUUM BUT RATHER THEY ARE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SAME THING
MaeJemison_2002 OUR EXPERIENCE TO INFLUENCE THE UNIVERSE EXTERNAL TO OURSELVES IT DOESN'T RELY ON US
MaeJemison_2002 IT
MaeJemison_2002 RIGHT
MaeJemison_2002 PEOPLE SAY INTUITIVE THAT'S LIKE
MaeJemison_2002 THE
MaeJemison_2002 AND
MaeJemison_2002 I CAME UP WITH
MaeJemison_2002 WE
MaeJemison_2002 A
