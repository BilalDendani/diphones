LarryBurns_2005 SONGS ARE WRITTEN ABOUT CARS PRINCE WROTE A GREAT SONG LITTLE RED CORVETTE HE DIDN'T WRITE LITTLE RED LAPTOP COMPUTER OR LITTLE RED DIRT DEVIL HE WROTE ABOUT A CAR
LarryBurns_2005 ONE OF MY FAVORITES HAS ALWAYS BEEN MAKE LOVE TO YOUR MAN IN A CHEVY VAN BECAUSE THAT WAS MY VEHICLE WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE
LarryBurns_2005 THE FACT IS WHEN WE DO OUR MARKET RESEARCH AROUND THE WORLD WE SEE THAT THERE'S NEARLY A UNIVERSAL ASPIRATION ON THE PART OF PEOPLE TO OWN AN AUTOMOBILE AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TODAY
LarryBurns_2005 A CAR AND YOU SAY BOY THAT'S A LOT BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S JUST TWELVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION WE REALLY HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION CAN THE WORLD SUSTAIN THAT NUMBER OF AUTOMOBILES
LarryBurns_2005 AND IF YOU LOOK AT PROJECTIONS OVER THE NEXT TEN TO FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS IT LOOKS LIKE THE WORLD CAR PARK COULD GROW TO ON THE ORDER OF ONE POINT ONE BILLION VEHICLES NOW IF YOU PARKED THOSE END TO END AND WRAPPED THEM AROUND THE EARTH
LarryBurns_2005 THAT WOULD STRETCH AROUND THE EARTH ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE TIMES NOW WE'VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS WITH AUTOMOBILE TECHNOLOGY OVER THE LAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS
LarryBurns_2005 CARS ARE DRAMATICALLY CLEANER DRAMATICALLY SAFER MORE EFFICIENT AND RADICALLY MORE AFFORDABLE THAN THEY WERE ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
LarryBurns_2005 BUT THE FACT REMAINS THE FUNDAMENTAL DNA OF THE AUTOMOBILE HAS STAYED PRETTY MUCH THE SAME IF WE ARE GOING TO REINVENT THE AUTOMOBILE TODAY
LarryBurns_2005 RATHER THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PRODUCT AND ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT EXIST TODAY WHAT WOULD WE DO
LarryBurns_2005 WE WANTED SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY AFFORDABLE THE FUEL CELL LOOKED GREAT ONE TENTH AS MANY MOVING PARTS AND A FUEL CELL PROPULSION SYSTEM AS AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE
LarryBurns_2005 SO WE EMBARKED UPON THE REINVENTION AROUND AN ELECTROCHEMICAL ENGINE THE FUEL CELL HYDROGEN AS THE ENERGY CARRIER FIRST WAS AUTONOMY AUTONOMY REALLY SET THE VISION FOR WHERE WE WANTED TO HEAD
LarryBurns_2005 WE EMBODIED ALL OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF A FUEL CELL PROPULSION SYSTEM WE THEN HAD AUTONOMY DRIVABLE WITH HY WIRE AND WE SHOWED HY WIRE HERE AT THIS CONFERENCE LAST YEAR
LarryBurns_2005 HY WIRE IS THE WORLD 'S FIRST DRIVABLE FUEL CELL AND WE HAVE FOLLOWED UP THAT NOW WITH SEQUEL AND SEQUEL TRULY IS A REAL CAR SO IF WE WOULD RUN THE VIDEO
LarryBurns_2005 BUT THE REAL KEY QUESTION I'M SURE THAT'S ON YOUR MIND WHERE'S THE HYDROGEN GOING TO COME FROM AND SECONDLY WHEN ARE THESE KINDS OF CARS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE
LarryBurns_2005 SO LET ME TALK ABOUT HYDROGEN FIRST THE BEAUTY OF HYDROGEN IS IT CAN COME FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT SOURCES
LarryBurns_2005 IT CAN COME FROM FOSSIL FUELS IT CAN COME FROM ANY WAY THAT YOU CAN CREATE ELECTRICITY INCLUDING RENEWABLES AND IT CAN COME FROM BIOFUELS AND THAT'S QUITE EXCITING
LarryBurns_2005 LOT OF HYDROGEN 'S PRODUCED TODAY IN THE WORLD IT'S PRODUCED TO GET SULPHUR OUT OF GASOLINE WHICH I FIND IS SOMEWHAT IRONIC IT'S PRODUCED IN THE FERTILIZER INDUSTRY IT'S PRODUCED IN THE
LarryBurns_2005 WE DID AN ANALYSIS WHERE YOU WOULD HAVE A STATION IN EACH CITY WITH EACH OF THE ONE HUNDRED LARGEST CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND LOCATED THE STATIONS SO YOU'D BE NO MORE THAN TWO MILES FROM A STATION AT ANY TIME WE PUT ONE EVERY TWENTY FIVE MILES ON THE FREEWAY
LarryBurns_2005 AND IT TURNS OUT THAT TRANSLATES INTO ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND STATIONS AND AT A MILLION DOLLARS EACH THAT WOULD BE ABOUT TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS NOW THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY
LarryBurns_2005 WE'RE PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF HYDROGEN WE THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF NOT WHETHER BUT A QUESTION OF WHEN WHAT WE'VE TARGETED FOR OURSELVES AND WE'RE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS FOR THIS GOAL IS TO HAVE A PROPULSION SYSTEM BASED ON HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELLS
LarryBurns_2005 DESIGNED AND VALIDATED THAT CAN GO HEAD TO HEAD WITH THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OBSOLETING THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE AND DO IT IN TERMS OF ITS AFFORDABILITY ADD SKILL VOLUMES
LarryBurns_2005 ITS PERFORMANCE AND ITS DURABILITY SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DRIVING TO FOR TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING YET IN OUR DEVELOPMENT WORK THAT SAYS THAT
LarryBurns_2005 WE ACTUALLY THINK THE FUTURE 'S GOING TO BE EVENT DRIVEN SO SINCE WE CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE WE WANT TO SPEND A LOT OF OUR TIME TRYING TO CREATE THAT FUTURE I'M VERY VERY INTRIGUED BY THE FACT THAT
LarryBurns_2005 OUR CARS AND TRUCKS SIT IDLE NINETY PERCENT OF THE TIME THEY'RE PARKED THEY PARKED ALL AROUND US THEY'RE USUALLY PARKED WITHIN ONE HUNDRED FEET OF THE PEOPLE THAT OWN THEM
LarryBurns_2005 NOW IF YOU TAKE THE POWER GENERATING CAPABILITY OF AN AUTOMOBILE AND YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE ELECTRIC GRID IN THE UNITED STATES IT TURNS OUT THAT FOUR PERCENT OF THE AUTOMOBILES THE POWER IN FOUR PERCENT OF THE AUTOMOBILES
LarryBurns_2005 AND HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELLS GIVE US THAT OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY USE OUR CARS AND TRUCKS WHEN THEY'RE PARKED TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY FOR THE
LarryBurns_2005 WE TALKED ABOUT SWARM NETWORKS EARLIER AND TALKING ABOUT THE ULTIMATE SWARM ABOUT HAVING ALL OF THE PROCESSORS AND ALL OF THE CARS WHEN THEY'RE SITTING IDLE BEING PART OF A GLOBAL GRID
LarryBurns_2005 FOR COMPUTING CAPABILITY WE FIND THAT PREMISE QUITE EXCITING THE AUTOMOBILE BECOMES THEN AN APPLIANCE NOT IN A COMMODITY SENSE BUT IN AN APPLIANCE MOBILE POWER MOBILE PLATFORM FOR INFORMATION AND COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATION
LarryBurns_2005 AS WELL AS A FORM OF TRANSPORTATION AND THE KEY TO ALL OF THIS IS TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE TO MAKE IT EXCITING TO GET IT ON A PATHWAY WHERE THERE'S A WAY TO MAKE MONEY DOING IT AND AGAIN THIS IS A PRETTY BIG MARCH TO TAKE
LarryBurns_2005 THE THEME OF THIS CONFERENCE I THINK HAS HIT ON REALLY ONE OF THE MAJOR KEYS TO PULL THAT OFF AND THAT'S RELATIONSHIPS AND WORKING TOGETHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
LarryBurns_2005 THAT GM IS NOT VIEWED AS SERIOUS ABOUT SOME OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL IDEAS AS SOME OF YOUR JAPANESE COMPETITORS MAYBE EVEN AS
LarryBurns_2005 ARE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT IT AND
LarryBurns_2005 WE'RE INTO THIS OVER A BILLION DOLLARS ALREADY SO I WOULD HOPE PEOPLE WOULD THINK WE'RE SERIOUS WHEN WE'RE SPENDING THAT KIND OF MONEY
LarryBurns_2005 AND SECONDLY IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL BUSINESS PROPOSITION I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU WE'RE INTO IT BECAUSE OF BUSINESS GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES WE CAN'T GROW OUR BUSINESS UNLESS WE SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS THE GROWTH OF THE AUTO INDUSTRY WILL BE CAPPED BY SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES IF WE DON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEMS
LarryBurns_2005 AND THERE'S A SIMPLE PRINCIPLE OF STRATEGY THAT SAYS DO UNTO YOURSELF BEFORE OTHERS DO UNTO YOU IF WE CAN SEE THIS POSSIBLE FUTURE OTHERS CAN TOO AND WE WANT TO BE THE FIRST
