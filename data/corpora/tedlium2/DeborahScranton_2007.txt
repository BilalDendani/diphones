DeborahScranton_2007@46.54:54.64 FOUR IN THE MORNING BUT IT WAS CLOSER TO MIDNIGHT WOKE STRAIGHT UP WIDE AWAKE AS COULD BE AND I HAD THIS IDEA WHAT IF I COULD IN EFFECT VIRTUALLY EMBED
DeborahScranton_2007@55.20:60.79 AND CREATE A PERMEABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SOLDIERS TO TELL THE STORY FROM THE INSIDE OUT VERSUS THE OUTSIDE IN
DeborahScranton_2007@61.57:66.02 SO I CALLED BACK MAJOR HEILSHORN WHO 'S THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE NATIONAL GUARD AND

DeborahScranton_2007@304.66:312.24 I WANT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BRIEF STORY WE WERE ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES TO GET IN THE CLASS WITH THE SONY CAMERAS AND THE VISTA
DeborahScranton_2007@320.91:328.19 SOME OTHER PEOPLE IN THE CLASS AND IT WENT ON AND ON I MEAN WE WERE THERE FOR AN HOUR TALKING AND IT REALLY HIGHLIGHTED SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK
DeborahScranton_2007@328.73:337.25 YOU GUYS TO THINK ABOUT AND HOPEFULLY TO HELP WITH WHICH IS I THINK A LOT OF US ARE VERY AFRAID TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WAR AND ABOUT POLITICS AND REALLY
DeborahScranton_2007@347.76:356.35 WAS TALKING AND HE THEN TURNED TO CONSTANCE AND SAID YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IF SHE WEREN'T HERE BECAUSE I KNOW SHE HAS MY BACK
DeborahScranton_2007@357.06:362.15 AND I WANT TO SAY I WAS NERVOUS BECAUSE I'M USED TO DOING Q AS I REALLY RELATED TO WHAT JAMES WAS SAYING YESTERDAY BECAUSE
DeborahScranton_2007@362.90:372.71 BEHIND THE CAMERA YOU KNOW I CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT MY MOVIE BUT FOR ME TO COME UP AND TALK FOR EIGHTEEN MINUTES IS A REALLY LONG TIME SO I WANTED TO SAY PAUL I'M HAPPY YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE
DeborahScranton_2007@387.84:390.77 I DIDN'T SAVE ALL OF THEM BECAUSE I DIDN'T REALIZE AT THE BEGINNING
DeborahScranton_2007@391.33:401.57 IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT I WOULD WANT TO KEEP TRACK OF BUT THERE WERE THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND ELEVEN EMAILS AND IMISS AND TEXT MESSAGES THAT I WAS ABLE TO
DeborahScranton_2007@404.46:415.70 THE REASON I QUANTIFY THAT IS BECAUSE WE REALLY EMBARKED ON THIS AS A MUTUAL JOURNEY TO REALLY GET INSIDE OF IT SO I WANTED TO SHOW YOU A CLIP AND THEN I WAS GOING TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT OF HOW IT GOT PUT TOGETHER
DeborahScranton_2007@429.14:429.77 OBVIOUSLY
DeborahScranton_2007@451.21:454.45 ADVISED WE'RE LEAVING TAJI RIGHT NOW WE BELIEVE THAT THE
DeborahScranton_2007@511.01:521.26 KNOW SOMEONE HAD HAD THROWN A QUARTER THROUGH A GUY AND IT WAS JUST LIKE THERE WAS NO BLOOD COMING FROM THE SHRAPNEL WOUNDS EVERYTHING WAS CAUTERIZED AND IT WAS JUST LIKE THERE WAS A VOID GOING GOING THROUGH THE BODY
DeborahScranton_2007@523.55:532.08 THIS IS THE SCENE NORTH THEY JUST REMOVED A BURNT BODY OR HALF A BODY FROM HERE I DON'T THINK THERE WAS
DeborahScranton_2007@563.94:569.77 LATER HEARD THAT IRAQI CASUALTIES WERE NOT TO BE TREATED IN TAJI THEY CAN WORK ON THE POST
DeborahScranton_2007@575.90:581.86 ONE OF THOSE INCOMPETENT MEDICAL OFFICERS TOLD ME TO STOP TREATMENT I WOULD 'VE SLIT HIS
DeborahScranton_2007@599.09:600.05 WE WANT TO OR NOT
DeborahScranton_2007@601.46:607.17 MORE VIOLENCE IN IRAQ TWIN SUICIDE CAR BOMBINGS KILLED EIGHT IRAQIS AND WOUNDED DOZENS
DeborahScranton_2007@612.36:617.34 I HAVE LOST ALL FAITH IN THE MEDIA A HAPLESS JOKE THAT I WOULD MUCH RATHER LAUGH AT THAN BECOME A
DeborahScranton_2007@618.83:624.50 I SHOULD REALLY THANK GOD FOR SAVING MY LUCKY ASS I'LL DO THAT THEN I'M GONNA JERK OFF BECAUSE THESE
DeborahScranton_2007@624.68:630.60 PAGES SMELL LIKE LINDZ AND THERE WON 'T BE ANY TIME FOR JERKING OFF TOMORROW ANOTHER MISSION AT SIX
DeborahScranton_2007@640.16:653.41 WHEN I SAID EARLIER TO TRY AND TELL A STORY FROM THE INSIDE OUT VERSUS THE OUTSIDE IN PART OF WHAT CHRIS SAID SO ELOQUENTLY IN HIS INTRODUCTION IS THIS MELDING IT'S A NEW WAY OF TRYING TO MAKE A DOCUMENTARY WHEN I MET THE GUYS AND
DeborahScranton_2007@654.89:664.61 TEN OF THEM AGREED TO TAKE CAMERAS IN TOTAL TWENTY ONE ENDED UP FILMING FIVE SOLDIERS FILMED THE ENTIRE TIME THERE ARE THREE FEATURED IN THE FILM THE WAY I LEARNED ABOUT TAJI WAS
DeborahScranton_2007@665.12:673.85 STEVE PINK SENT ME AN EMAIL AND IN IT ATTACHED A PHOTO OF THAT BURNED BODY OUT AT THE CAR AND THE TONE FROM THE EMAIL WAS YOU KNOW IT HAD BEEN A VERY BAD DAY OBVIOUSLY
DeborahScranton_2007@674.37:683.40 AND I SAW IN MY IM WINDOW THAT MIKE MORIARTY WAS AT THE BASE SO I PINGED MIKE AND I SAID MIKE CAN YOU PLEASE GO GET THAT INTERVIEW WITH PINK BECAUSE
DeborahScranton_2007@683.68:695.07 THE THING THAT VERY OFTEN IS MISSING IS IN THE MILITARY WHAT THEY CALL HOT WASH IT'S THAT IMMEDIATE INTERVIEW AFTER SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY HAPPENS YOU KNOW AND IF YOU LET TIME GO BY IT KIND OF SOFTENS AND SMOOTHS THE EDGES AND FOR ME
DeborahScranton_2007@695.52:708.70 I REALLY WANTED THAT SO IN ORDER TO GET THE INTIMACY TO SHARE THAT EXPERIENCE WITH YOU THE GUYS THE TWO MOST POPULAR MOUNTS THERE WAS A CAMERA ON THE TURRET THE GUN TURRET AND THEN ON THE DASHBOARD OF THE HUMVEE MOST OF THE
DeborahScranton_2007@709.46:716.02 HUMVEES WE ENDED UP MOUNTING TWO CAMERAS IN THEM SO YOU GET TO EXPERIENCE THAT IN REAL TIME
DeborahScranton_2007@741.59:743.69 THE NEWS FOOTAGE I PUT IN THERE
DeborahScranton_2007@744.39:745.80 TO TRY TO SHOW
DeborahScranton_2007@746.73:759.31 YOU KNOW I THINK MAINSTREAM MEDIA TRIES TO DO THE BEST THEY CAN IN THE FORMAT THAT THEY HAVE BUT THE THING THAT I KNOW YOU ALL HAVE HEARD A LOT OF TIMES AMERICAN SOLDIERS SAYING WHY DON'T THEY TALK ABOUT THE GOOD STUFF THAT WE DO OK THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE
DeborahScranton_2007@768.18:775.33 THEY SPENT THEIR ENTIRE DAY OUTSIDE THE WIRE TRYING TO SAVE IRAQI LIVES THE IRAQIS WHO WORK ON THE POST
DeborahScranton_2007@775.77:786.08 SO WHEN YOU MAY HEAR SOLDIERS COMPLAINING THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW AND I THINK IT'S SUCH AN AMAZING GIFT THAT THEY WOULD SHARE THIS AS A WAY OF BRIDGING AND
DeborahScranton_2007@787.53:801.38 WHEN I TALK ABOUT THAT POLARITY I GET AT SO MANY DIFFERENT Q AS AND PEOPLE ARE REALLY OPINIONATED BUT IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HEAR SO MUCH OR LISTEN OR TRY TO HAVE AN EXCHANGE AND I'M AS FIERY AS THE NEXT PERSON BUT I REALLY THINK YOU KNOW
DeborahScranton_2007@808.71:816.10 WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GO INTO SCARY PLACES WHERE WE MAY YOU KNOW WE THINK WE KNOW BUT WE JUST HAVE TO LEAVE THAT LITTLE BIT OF OPENNESS TO
DeborahScranton_2007@819.64:820.43 SUCH A DISCONNECT
DeborahScranton_2007@821.19:823.79 AND FOR ME IT'S TRYING TO BRIDGE THAT DISCONNECT
DeborahScranton_2007@851.53:856.76 THE LAST ONES AND I'VE LEARNED OVER TIME THAT THOSE ARE ALWAYS THE SOLDIERS
DeborahScranton_2007@858.24:860.48 THEY WAIT UNTIL PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY 'S GONE
DeborahScranton_2007@863.45:864.74 FOR ME ONE OF THE MOST
DeborahScranton_2007@873.26:885.42 FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM AND IT'S NOT A SPOILER IT'S VERY COMMON THERE ARE A LOT OF CIVILIAN ACCIDENTS WHERE PEOPLE GET IN FRONT OF HUMVEES AND THEY GET KILLED IN THIS FILM THERE IS A SCENE WHERE AN IRAQI WOMAN IS KILLED
DeborahScranton_2007@887.33:890.04 A SOLDIER CAME UP TO ME AND
DeborahScranton_2007@891.39:892.39 STOOD YOU KNOW
DeborahScranton_2007@894.10:896.24 CLOSE A FOOT AWAY FROM ME HE 'S A BIG GUY
DeborahScranton_2007@897.14:898.59 AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND I
DeborahScranton_2007@904.41:906.34 IN HIS EYES AND HE WASN'T GOING TO BLINK
DeborahScranton_2007@908.42:911.00 AND HE SAID MY GUNNER WAS THROWING CANDY
DeborahScranton_2007@912.91:913.96 AND I KNEW WHAT HE WAS GOING
DeborahScranton_2007@915.35:918.83 THE GUNNER WAS THROWING CANDY THEY USED TO THROW CANDY TO THE KIDS
DeborahScranton_2007@920.05:921.95 KIDS GOT TOO CLOSE VERY OFTEN
DeborahScranton_2007@923.27:924.90 AND HE SAID I KILLED A CHILD
DeborahScranton_2007@925.74:927.30 AND I'M A FATHER
DeborahScranton_2007@928.16:930.42 I HAVE CHILDREN I HAVEN'T
DeborahScranton_2007@930.73:933.98 BEEN ABLE TO TELL MY WIFE I'M AFRAID SHE'S GOING TO THINK I'M A MONSTER
DeborahScranton_2007@940.02:941.44 I HUGGED HIM OF COURSE
DeborahScranton_2007@941.91:945.86 AND I SAID YOU KNOW IT 'S GOING TO BE OK AND HE SAID I 'M GOING TO BRING HER TO SEE YOUR FILM
DeborahScranton_2007@956.76:958.29 WHEN I TALK ABOUT A DISCONNECT
DeborahScranton_2007@958.82:963.04 IT'S NOT ONLY FOR MAYBE THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW A SOLDIER WHICH THERE OBVIOUSLY ARE
DeborahScranton_2007@963.50:970.89 YOU KNOW THESE DAYS IT'S NOT LIKE WORLD WAR II WHERE THERE WAS A WAR FRONT AND A HOME FRONT AND EVERYBODY SEEMED INVOLVED YOU CAN GO FOR DAYS HERE AND NOT FEEL LIKE
DeborahScranton_2007@971.27:980.07 THERE'S A WAR GOING ON AND OFTEN I'LL HEAR PEOPLE SAY WHO MAYBE KNOW THAT I DID THIS FILM AND THEY SAY OH YOU KNOW I'M AGAINST THE WAR BUT I SUPPORT THE SOLDIERS
DeborahScranton_2007@985.27:986.84 TO ASK THEM WELL
DeborahScranton_2007@992.63:995.78 YOU GO AND SEE ANYBODY DO YOU IF YOU FIND OUT
DeborahScranton_2007@1000.35:1003.78 SPEND SOME TIME NOT NECESSARILY ASK QUESTIONS BUT SEE IF THEY WANT TO TALK
DeborahScranton_2007@1004.58:1018.00 DO YOU GIVE MONEY TO ANY OF THE CHARITIES YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY LIKE DEAN KAMEN 'S WORKING ON THAT AMAZING THING BUT THERE'S CHARITIES WHERE YOU CAN SPONSOR COMPUTERS FOR WOUNDED SOLDIERS I THINK I CHALLENGE US TO SAY
DeborahScranton_2007@1019.21:1032.67 TO OPERATIONALIZE THOSE TERMS WHEN WE SAY WE SUPPORT SOMEONE YOU KNOW ARE YOU A FRIEND TO THEM DO YOU REALLY CARE AND I WOULD JUST SAY IT'S MY HOPE AND I WOULD ASK YOU GUYS TO PLEASE YOU KNOW REACH OUT A HAND
