MadeleineAlbright_2010W WHICH HE DESERVED HE HAD INVADED ANOTHER COUNTRY AND SO ALL OF A SUDDEN A POEM APPEARED IN THE PAPERS IN BAGHDAD COMPARING ME TO MANY THINGS BUT AMONG THEM AN UNPARALLELED SERPENT AND SO I HAPPENED TO HAVE A SNAKE PIN SO I WORE IT WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT IRAQ
MadeleineAlbright_2010W TO MEET THE PRESS THEY ZEROED IN SAID WHY ARE YOU WEARING THAT SNAKE PIN I SAID BECAUSE SADDAM HUSSEIN COMPARED ME TO AN UNPARALLELED SERPENT AND THEN I THOUGHT WELL THIS IS FUN SO I WENT OUT
MadeleineAlbright_2010W SO IS THIS A GOOD IDEA I REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE
MadeleineAlbright_2010W THEN THE VOICE OF THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT BE HEARD AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAD THAT FEELING
MadeleineAlbright_2010W RELUCTANT FEMALE MODE AND DECIDE THAT I HAD TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTRY AND SO THAT HAPPENED MORE AT VARIOUS TIMES BUT I REALLY THINK THAT THERE WAS A GREAT ADVANTAGE IN MANY WAYS TO BEING A WOMAN
MadeleineAlbright_2010W I THINK WE ARE A LOT BETTER AT PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND THEN HAVE THE CAPABILITY OBVIOUSLY OF TELLING IT LIKE IT IS WHEN IT 'S NECESSARY
MadeleineAlbright_2010W THAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WHILE MANY OF US HAVE HAD HUGE OPPORTUNITIES AND PAT YOU HAVE BEEN A REAL LEADER IN YOUR FIELD
MadeleineAlbright_2010W IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF WOMEN THAT ARE NOT CAPABLE OF WORRYING AND TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES AND UNDERSTANDING THAT WOMEN HAVE TO HELP OTHER WOMEN AND SO WHAT I HAVE FELT AND I HAVE LOOKED AT THIS FROM A
MadeleineAlbright_2010W NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF STATE I DECIDED THAT WOMEN 'S ISSUES
MadeleineAlbright_2010W HAD TO BE CENTRAL TO AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY NOT JUST BECAUSE I 'M A FEMINIST BUT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT SOCIETIES ARE BETTER OFF WHEN WOMEN ARE POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY EMPOWERED
MadeleineAlbright_2010W THAT VALUES ARE PASSED DOWN THE HEALTH SITUATION IS BETTER EDUCATION IS BETTER THERE IS GREATER ECONOMIC PROSPERITY SO I THINK THAT IT BEHOOVES US THOSE OF US THAT LIVE IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES WHERE WE DO HAVE
MadeleineAlbright_2010W THE BOTTOM LINE THAT I DECIDED WAS ACTUALLY WOMEN 'S ISSUES ARE THE HARDEST ISSUES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH LIFE AND DEATH IN SO MANY ASPECTS AND BECAUSE AS I SAID IT IS REALLY CENTRAL TO THE WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT THINGS NOW
MadeleineAlbright_2010W FOR INSTANCE SOME OF THE WARS THAT TOOK PLACE WHEN I WAS IN OFFICE A LOT OF THEM THE WOMEN WERE THE MAIN VICTIMS OF IT FOR INSTANCE WHEN I STARTED THERE WERE WARS IN THE BALKANS
MadeleineAlbright_2010W THE WOMEN IN BOSNIA WERE BEING RAPED WE THEN MANAGED TO SET UP A WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL TO DEAL SPECIFICALLY WITH THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES AND BY THE WAY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DID AT THAT STAGE WAS I HAD JUST ARRIVED AT THE U N AND WHEN I WAS THERE
MadeleineAlbright_2010W JAMAICA LICHTENSTEIN AND ME SO BEING AN AMERICAN I DECIDED TO SET UP A CAUCUS LAUGHTER AND
MadeleineAlbright_2010W AND YET WE HEAR THERE ARE MORE WOMEN AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLES NOW YOU WERE AT THOSE NEGOTIATING TABLES WHEN THEY WEREN 'T
MadeleineAlbright_2010W THERE IS A WAY WHEN THERE ARE MORE WOMEN AT THE TABLE
MadeleineAlbright_2010W THAT THERE 'S AN ATTEMPT TO DEVELOP SOME UNDERSTANDING SO FOR INSTANCE WHAT I DID WHEN I WENT TO BURUNDI WE 'D GOT TUTSI AND HUTU WOMEN TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN RWANDA
MadeleineAlbright_2010W AND SO I THINK THE CAPABILITY OF WOMEN TO PUT THEMSELVES I THINK WE 'RE BETTER ABOUT PUTTING OURSELVES INTO THE OTHER GUY 'S SHOES AND HAVING MORE EMPATHY I THINK IT HELPS IN TERMS OF THE SUPPORT IF THERE ARE OTHER WOMEN IN THE ROOM WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF STATE THERE WERE ONLY THIRTEEN OTHER WOMEN FOREIGN MINISTERS
MadeleineAlbright_2010W AND SO IT WAS NICE WHEN ONE OF THEM WOULD SHOW UP FOR INSTANCE SHE IS NOW THE PRESIDENT OF FINLAND BUT TARJA HALONEN WAS
MadeleineAlbright_2010W OF WOMEN IN A SERIES OF FOREIGN POLICY POSITIONS THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT A LOT OF NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY ISN 'T JUST ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY BUT IT 'S ABOUT BUDGETS MILITARY BUDGETS AND HOW THE DEBTS OF COUNTRIES WORK OUT
MadeleineAlbright_2010W IF YOU HAVE WOMEN IN A VARIETY OF FOREIGN POLICY POSTS THEY CAN SUPPORT EACH OTHER WHEN THERE ARE BUDGET DECISIONS BEING MADE IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES
MadeleineAlbright_2010W WOMEN TO BE IN POLITICAL OFFICE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY CAN IN FACT DEVELOP POLITICAL VOICES
MadeleineAlbright_2010W I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO BE SUPPORTIVE WHEN BUSINESSES ARE BEING CREATED AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT WOMEN HELP EACH OTHER NOW I HAVE A SAYING THAT I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT BECAUSE
MadeleineAlbright_2010W I AM OF A CERTAIN AGE WHERE WHEN I STARTED IN MY CAREER BELIEVE IT OR NOT THERE WERE OTHER WOMEN WHO CRITICIZED ME WHY AREN 'T YOU IN THE CARPOOL LINE OR AREN 'T YOUR CHILDREN SUFFERING BECAUSE YOU 'RE NOT THERE ALL THE TIME
MadeleineAlbright_2010W AND I THINK WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO MAKE EACH OTHER FEEL GUILTY IN FACT I THINK GUILT IS EVERY WOMAN 'S MIDDLE NAME AND SO I THINK WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS WE NEED TO HELP EACH OTHER AND MY MOTTO IS THAT THERE 'S A SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL FOR WOMEN WHO DON 'T HELP EACH OTHER
