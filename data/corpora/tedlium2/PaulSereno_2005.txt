PaulSereno_2005@26.97:39.30 ON THE LAND THE LITTLE BITS OF LAND FLOATING AROUND BUT THEY ARE IMPORTANT TO US BECAUSE THEY'RE SORT OF IN OUR SCALE OF EXPERIENCE FROM MILLIMETERS TO METERS AND THESE ANIMALS DISAPPEARED AND A SEPARATE LIFE
PaulSereno_2005@40.18:53.13 MAMMALS RADIATED OUT TO TAKE THEIR PLACE AND SO WE KNOW THIS IN EXTRAORDINARY DETAIL AND SO THIS IS A CORE FROM NEAR BERMUDA WE KNOW THAT THE TSUNAMIS THE EARTHQUAKES AND THE THINGS THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE ENTIRE RECORD OF HUMANKIND HISTORY
PaulSereno_2005@54.02:59.95 REALLY QUITE GET AROUND THE KIND OF DISASTER THAT THIS REPRESENTED FOR THE EARTH SO
PaulSereno_2005@60.62:68.02 EVEN BEFORE THAT IMPACT WAS KNOWN EVEN BEFORE SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL CAME TO AN AGREEMENT OVER THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION
PaulSereno_2005@68.93:77.60 SCIENTISTS AND NATURAL HISTORIANS OF ALL KINDS OF STRIPES ACTUALLY HAD DIVIDED EARTH 'S LIFE 'S HISTORY INTO THESE TWO EPISODES MESOZOIC THE MIDDLE LIFE AND
PaulSereno_2005@78.22:85.90 THE CENOZOIC THE RECENT LIFE AND AS IT TURNS OUT IT ACTUALLY CORRESPONDS REALLY NICELY WITH GEOLOGIC HISTORY SO WE HAVE A MESOZOIC PERIOD
PaulSereno_2005@86.29:93.19 AN AGE OF FRAGMENTATION AND A CENOZOIC PERIOD AN AGE OF RECONNECTION SOUTH AMERICA TO NORTH AMERICA INDIA TO ASIA
PaulSereno_2005@93.58:106.40 AND SO MY WORK REALLY IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE CHARACTER OF THAT MESOZOIC RADIATION COMPARED TO THE CENOZOIC RADIATION TO SEE WHAT MYSTERIES WE CAN UNDERSTAND FROM DINOSAURS AND FROM OTHER ANIMALS ABOUT WHAT LIFE
PaulSereno_2005@106.74:119.46 ON DRIFTING CONTINENTS REALLY CAN TELL US ABOUT EVOLUTION THE WORK IMMEDIATELY BEGS THE QUESTION WHY DIDN'T THEY GO INTO THE WATERS I MEAN CERTAINLY MAMMALS DID THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE YOU CAN GO OUTSIDE SEE MANY OTHER EXAMPLES WITHIN FIVE TEN MILLION YEARS
PaulSereno_2005@120.06:129.36 OF THE BOLIDE IMPACT WE HAD A WHOLE VARIETY OF ANIMALS GOING INTO THE WATER WHY DIDN'T THEY DO THAT WHY DIDN'T THEY HANG AROUND IN TREES AT GOOD SIZE AND WHY DIDN'T THEY BURROW
PaulSereno_2005@139.21:150.03 REALLY INTERESTING QUESTIONS I THINK A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH BODY SIZE IN FACT I THINK THAT MOST OF IT HAS TO DO WITH BODY SIZE THE SIZE YOU ARE WHEN YOU INHERIT
PaulSereno_2005@151.06:159.33 A VACANT ECOSPACE FROM WHATEVER NATURAL DISASTER LOOKING AT DINOSAUR EVOLUTION AND STUDYING IT DIGGING IT UP FOR MANY YEARS
PaulSereno_2005@160.02:168.54 I END UP LOOKING AT THE MAMMAL RADIATION AND IT SEEMS AS THOUGH EVERYTHING IS QUICK TIME JUST LIKE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCING BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE DINOSAUR EVOLUTION
PaulSereno_2005@177.65:188.91 THE TIME IT TOOK TO REACH MAXIMUM BODY SIZE YES THEY DO HAVE LARGER BODY SIZE BUT MANY OF THEM ARE SMALLER BUT WE'RE INTERESTED IN THE TIME IT TOOK THEM TO ACHIEVE THAT FIFTY MILLION YEARS TO ACHIEVE THIS MAXIMUM BODY SIZE
PaulSereno_2005@189.54:199.88 AND THAT IS TEN TIMES LONGER THAN IT TOOK THE MAMMALS TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM BODY SIZE AND INVADE ALL THOSE HABITATS SO THERE'S LESSONS TO LEARN AND THERE'S LESSONS TO LEARN FROM THE EXCEPTION
PaulSereno_2005@200.29:208.74 THE EXCEPTION THAT WE KNOW VERY WELL TODAY FROM THE DISCOVERIES WE'VE MADE AND MANY OTHER SCHOLARS HAVE MADE AROUND THE WORLD THIS SLIDE WAS SHOWN BEFORE THIS IS THE FAMOUS JURASSIC BIRD
PaulSereno_2005@210.23:218.18 WE NOW KNOW THIS TRANSITION IS THE ONE TIME THAT DINOSAURS ACTUALLY WENT BELOW THAT BODY SIZE WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHERE THEY BEGAN IN A MINUTE
PaulSereno_2005@218.90:227.02 AND IT IS THE ONE TIME THAT THEY RAPIDLY INVADED ALL THE HABITATS I JUST TOLD YOU THAT DINOSAURS WEREN'T IN THEY BECAME MARINE WE NOW KNOW THEM TODAY
PaulSereno_2005@227.40:234.93 FROM THE ICE CAPS THERE'S BURROWING BIRDS THEY INHABIT THE TREES AT ALL BODY SIZES AND OF COURSE THEY INHABIT THE LAND SO
PaulSereno_2005@235.06:242.01 WE WERE THE FIRST TO ACTUALLY NAME THAT LATER EXPLODED ONTO THE PAGES OF SCIENCE AND NATURE
PaulSereno_2005@242.23:251.79 WE CALLED THIS BIRD SINORNIS IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE ADVANCED THAN ARCHAEOPTERYX AND IF YOU GO TO DIFFERENT LAYERS YOU FIND THINGS THAT ARE LESS ADVANCED THAN ARCHAEOPTERYX AND EVERY GRADE IN BETWEEN SO THAT IF YOU FIND SOMETHING TODAY
PaulSereno_2005@279.92:286.79 TO THOSE BEDS WHERE THEY HAD PICKED UP FRAGMENTS GO BACK TO A TIME AND A PLACE WHERE THE EARLIEST DINOSAURS EXISTED I'D LIKE TO CALL FOR
PaulSereno_2005@287.37:299.10 THIS LITTLE VIDEO CLIP TO GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF SORT OF WHAT WE FACE NORMALLY WE GET ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS WELL HOW DO YOU FIND FOSSILS IN AREAS THAT LOOK LIKE THIS IF WE COULD ROLL THAT FIRST VIDEO CLIP THIS IS SORT OF A
PaulSereno_2005@299.92:309.04 NICE HELICOPTER RIDE THROUGH THOSE EARLY BEDS AND THEY'RE LOCATED IN NORTHEASTERN ARGENTINA AND WE'RE COMING OVER A CLIFF AND AT THE TOP OF THAT CLIFF DINOSAURS HAD BASICALLY TAKEN OVER
PaulSereno_2005@309.45:320.83 AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF WE FIND THAT THEY'RE RARE AS HENS TEETH THAT'S WHERE DINOSAUR ORIGINS IS TO BE FOUND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF YOU GO INTO AN AREA LIKE THIS YOU GET A GEOLOGIC MAP YOU GET A TOPOGRAPHIC MAP AND THE BEST MOST INSPIRED TEAM
PaulSereno_2005@321.61:332.13 YOU CAN BRING TO THE AREA AND THE REST IS UP TO YOU YOU'VE GOT TO FIND FOSSILS YOU'VE GOT TO DIG A HOLE THAT'S USUALLY QUITE A BIT BIGGER THAN THAT TO GET IT OUT YOU'VE GOT TO CLIMB THOSE CLIFFS AND FIND
PaulSereno_2005@332.73:341.53 REALLY EVERYTHING THAT EXISTED NOT JUST THE DINOSAURS BUT THE ENTIRE STORY IF YOU'RE LUCKY AND YOU DIG A PLACE LIKE THAT YOU ACTUALLY FIND THE ASH BED TO DIG IT AND WE DID
PaulSereno_2005@341.82:355.31 TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT MILLION YEARS OLD WE FOUND WHAT REALLY IS THE MOST PRIMITIVE DINOSAUR THAT'S THE UR DINOSAUR A THREE AND A HALF FOOT THING BEAUTIFUL SKULL PREDATOR MEAT EATER A TWO LEGGED ANIMAL
PaulSereno_2005@355.65:370.26 SO ALL THE OTHER DINOSAURS THAT YOU KNOW OR YOUR KIDS KNOW AT LEAST ON FOUR LEGS THIS IS SORT OF A LOOK AT THE SKULL AND IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC THING ABOUT FIVE OR SIX INCHES LONG IT LOOKS RATHER BIRD LIKE BECAUSE IT IS IT'S BIRD LIKE AND HOLLOW A PREDATOR
PaulSereno_2005@370.71:377.83 MAYBE TWENTY FIVE POUNDS OR TEN KILOGRAMS THAT'S WHERE DINOSAURS BEGAN THAT'S WHERE THE RADIATION BEGAN THAT IS TEN TIMES LARGER
PaulSereno_2005@378.25:386.01 THAN THE MAMMAL RADIATION WHICH WAS A FOUR LEGGED RADIATION WE ARE EXTREMELY DINOSAUR LIKE AND UNUSUAL IN OUR TWO LEGGED APPROACH TO LIFE
PaulSereno_2005@386.73:394.77 NOW IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED THEN WHEN THE CONTINENTS BROKE APART AND DINOSAURS FOUND LANDLUBBERS AS THEY ARE FOUND THEMSELVES ADRIFT
PaulSereno_2005@415.81:424.42 BEEN TO SOME OF THOSE CONTINENTS BUT AFRICA WAS IN THE WORDS OF STEVEN PINKER WAS A BLANK SLATE LARGELY BUT ONE WITH AN IMMENSE CHALKBOARD IN THE MIDDLE
PaulSereno_2005@424.70:433.13 WITH LOTS OF LITTLE AREAS OF DINOSAUR ROCK IF YOU COULD SURVIVE AN EXPEDITION THERE'S NO ROADS INTO THE SAHARA IT'S AN ENORMOUS PLACE TO
PaulSereno_2005@433.60:441.20 BE ABLE TO EXCAVATE THE EIGHTY TONS OF DINOSAURS THAT WE HAVE IN THE SAHARA AND TAKE THEM OUT YOU REALLY HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER AN EXPEDITION TEAM
PaulSereno_2005@441.58:451.16 THAT CAN HANDLE THE CONDITIONS SOME OF THEM ARE POLITICAL MANY OF THEM ARE PHYSICAL SOME OF THEM THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE MENTAL AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND
PaulSereno_2005@467.23:476.67 PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND SCIENCE AS ADVENTURE WITH A PURPOSE THEY'RE USUALLY STUDENTS WHO 'VE NEVER SEEN A DESERT SOME OF THEM ARE MORE EXPERIENCED YOUR JOB AS A LEADER THIS IS DEFINITELY A TEAM SPORT
PaulSereno_2005@490.69:500.17 SO YOU CAN'T LEAVE YOUR NORMAL METAL TOOLS OUT BECAUSE YOU'LL GET A FIRST DEGREE BURN IF YOU GRAB THEM SOMETIMES SO YOU ARE FINDING YOURSELF ALSO IN AN AMAZING CULTURAL MILIEU
PaulSereno_2005@501.23:509.07 REALLY RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH THE WORLD 'S LAST GREAT NOMADIC PEOPLE THESE ARE THE TUAREG NOMADS AND THEY'RE LIVING THEIR LIVES MUCH
PaulSereno_2005@509.89:519.30 THEY HAVE FOR CENTURIES YOUR JOB IS TO EXCAVATE THINGS LIKE THIS IN THE FOREGROUND AND MAKE THEM ENTER THE PAGES OF HISTORY TO DO THAT YOU'VE GOT TO ACTUALLY TRANSPORT THEM THOUSANDS OF MILES OUT OF THE DESERT
PaulSereno_2005@532.56:541.37 YOU TRANSPORTED THE BONES OUT YOURSELF TO THE COAST OF AFRICA ONTO A BOAT IF YOU WANTED TO GET THEM OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE SAHARA THAT'S A TWO THOUSAND MILE JOURNEY
PaulSereno_2005@541.74:550.29 SO ENORMOUS EXCAVATIONS AND A LOT OF WORK AND OUT OF ESSENTIALLY A PARTIAL HERD OF DINOSAURS THAT YOU SAW BURIED THERE TWENTY TONS OF MATERIAL
PaulSereno_2005@551.24:564.91 WE ERECT JOBARIA A SAUROPOD DINOSAUR LIKE WE HAVEN'T SEEN ON SOME OTHER CONTINENTS IT REALLY IS A LITTLE BIT OUT OF PLACE TEMPORALLY IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE WHAT WE WOULD FIND IF WE DUG IN CONTEMPORARY BEDS IN NORTH AMERICA HERE 'S THE ANIMAL THAT WAS CAUSING IT TROUBLE
PaulSereno_2005@566.51:581.67 AND YOU KNOW ON AND ON A WHOLE MENAGERIE WHEN YOU PICK UP SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND SOME OF YOU HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO TOUCH IT THIS IS A PIECE OF HISTORY YOU'RE TOUCHING SOMETHING THAT'S ONE HUNDRED AND TEN MILLIONS YEARS OLD THIS IS A THUMB CLAW THERE IT WAS MOMENTS AFTER IT WAS DISCOVERED IT IS AN INCREDIBLE VIEW OF LIFE AND IT REALLY BEGAN WHEN WE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND
PaulSereno_2005@582.23:593.28 THE DEPTH OF TIME IT'S ONLY BEEN WITH US FOR LESS THAN A CENTURY AND IN THAT TIME THAT FOURTH DIMENSION WHEN RADIOACTIVE DATING CAME ABOUT LESS THAN A CENTURY AGO AND WE COULD ACTUALLY TELL HOW OLD SOME OF THESE THINGS
PaulSereno_2005@594.43:603.95 IS PROBABLY THE MOST PROFOUND TRANSFORMATION BECAUSE IT CHANGES THE WAY WE LOOK AT OURSELVES AND THE WORLD DRAMATICALLY WHEN YOU PICK UP A PIECE OF HISTORY LIKE THAT I THINK IT CAN TRANSFORM
PaulSereno_2005@605.15:611.16 KIDS THAT ARE POSSIBLY INTERESTED IN SCIENCE THAT'S THE ANIMAL THAT THUMB CLAW CAME FROM SUCHAMIMUS HERE 'S SOME OTHERS
PaulSereno_2005@612.26:621.69 THIS IS SOMETHING WE FOUND IN MOROCCO AN IMMENSE ANIMAL WE PROTOTYPED BY CAT SCANNING THE BRAIN OUT OF THIS ANIMAL IT TURNS OUT TO HAVE A FOREBRAIN ONE FIFTEENTH THE SIZE OF A HUMAN
PaulSereno_2005@622.08:629.95 THIS WAS THE COVER OF SCIENCE BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT HUMANS WERE MORE INTELLIGENT THAN THESE ANIMALS BUT WE CAN SEE BY SOME IN OUR ADMINISTRATION THAT DESPITE
PaulSereno_2005@631.23:636.41 THE ENORMOUS ADVANTAGE IN BRAIN VOLUME SOME OF THE ATTITUDES REMAIN THE SAME ANYWAY
PaulSereno_2005@637.79:650.67 SMALLER RAPTORS ALL THE STUFF FROM JURASSIC PARK THAT YOU KNOW OF ALL THOSE SMALL ANIMALS THEY ALL COME FROM NORTHERN CONTINENTS THIS IS THE FIRST SKELETON FROM A SOUTHERN CONTINENT AND GUESS WHAT YOU START PREPARING IT
PaulSereno_2005@651.32:663.48 IT HAS NO BIG CLAW ON ITS HIND FOOT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A VELOCIRAPTOR IT'S REALLY A WHOLLY SEPARATE RADIATION SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER HERE IS A STORY IT INVOLVES FLYING REPTILES LIKE THIS PTEROSAUR THAT WE RECONSTRUCTED FROM AFRICA
PaulSereno_2005@671.96:681.78 LOWER JAW JUST LAYING THERE IN THE DESERT OF THIS ENORMOUS CROCODILE THE CROCODILE IS TECHNICALLY CALLED SARCOSUCHUS THAT'S AN ADULT ORINOCO CROCODILE IN ITS JAWS
PaulSereno_2005@682.26:692.85 TO TRY AND RECONSTRUCT THIS WE HAD TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT RECENT CROCODILES TO UNDERSTAND HOW CROCODILES SCALE COULD I HAVE THE SECOND LITTLE VIDEO CLIP NOW THIS FIELD IS JUST AND OF COURSE SCIENCE IN GENERAL IS
PaulSereno_2005@698.63:701.04 THE LARGEST CROCODILES LIVING TODAY AS LONG AS
PaulSereno_2005@702.57:706.54 THAT SET OF CHOPPERS YEAH HE 'S A BIG ONE IF THEY CAN JUST LAND
PaulSereno_2005@706.92:712.72 THIS CROC WILL PROVIDE USEFUL DATA HELPING PAUL IN HIS QUEST TO UNDERSTAND SARCOSUCHUS
PaulSereno_2005@735.33:735.56 IT
PaulSereno_2005@741.95:742.44 THE
PaulSereno_2005@758.26:760.54 A FOURTEEN FOOT CROC
PaulSereno_2005@761.10:761.70 I KNEW
PaulSereno_2005@766.60:769.72 DON'T GET OFF YOU DON'T GET OFF BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME
PaulSereno_2005@807.14:818.63 THE FOSSIL RECORD IS TRULY AMAZING BECAUSE IT REALLY FORCES YOU TO LOOK AT LIVING ANIMALS IN A NEW WAY WE PROVED WITH THOSE MEASUREMENTS THAT CROCODILES SCALED ISOMETRICALLY IT DEPENDED ON THE SHAPE OF THEIR SKULL THOUGH SO WE HAD TO ACTUALLY GET THOSE MEASUREMENTS
PaulSereno_2005@818.91:824.79 TO BE SURE THAT WE HAD RECONSTRUCTED AND COULD PROVE TO THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD THAT SUPERCROC IN FACT IS A FORTY FOOT CROCODILE PROBABLY A MALE
PaulSereno_2005@825.27:833.05 ANYWAY YOU FIND OTHER THINGS TOO I'M GOING TO LEAD AN EXPEDITION TO THE SAHARA TO DIG UP AFRICA 'S LARGEST NEOLITHIC SITE WE FOUND THIS
PaulSereno_2005@840.58:846.09 OF THE COLONIZATION OF THE SAHARA FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO IS BEEN SITTING OUT THERE WAITING FOR US TO GO BACK SO
PaulSereno_2005@846.47:856.76 REALLY EXCITING AND THEN WORK LATER IS GOING TO TAKE US TO TIBET NOW WE NORMALLY THINK OF TIBET AS A HIGHLAND IT'S REALLY AN ISLAND CONTINENT IT WAS A PRECURSOR TO INDIA A MESSENGER FROM
PaulSereno_2005@858.58:866.23 A LOST PARADISE OF DINOSAURS ISOLATED FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS NO ONE 'S FOUND THEM WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE AND WE'RE GOING TO GO AND GET THEM NEXT YEAR
PaulSereno_2005@866.41:876.85 THEY'RE ONLY BETWEEN THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND FEET BUT IF YOU GO IN THE WARM PART OF THE YEAR IT'S OK NOW I TRIED TO SUTURE TOGETHER A DINOSAUR EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO
PaulSereno_2005@895.51:903.32 WITH REGARD TO THE BIOGEOGRAPHIC QUESTION THE EARTH IS DIVIDING THESE ARE ALL LANDLUBBING ANIMALS THERE'S A COUPLE OF CHOICES YOU GET DIVIDED AND A
PaulSereno_2005@913.51:921.30 YOU'RE LIVING PEACEFULLY ON EACH SIDE AND ON ONE SIDE YOU JUST GO EXTINCT AND YOU SURVIVE ON THE OTHER SIDE AND CREATE A DIFFERENCE AND THE FOURTH THING IS THAT
PaulSereno_2005@921.73:928.55 YOU ACTUALLY DID ONE OR THE OTHER OF THOSE THREE THINGS BUT THE PALEONTOLOGIST NEVER FOUND YOU AND YOU TAKE THOSE FOUR INSTANCES
PaulSereno_2005@942.07:950.81 TWO OR THREE DEGREES OF THE POLE TO MAINTAIN SIMILARITY BETWEEN CONTINENTS BUT WHEN THEY WERE DIVIDED INDEED THEY WERE DIVIDED AND WE DO SEE THE CONTINENTS
PaulSereno_2005@958.57:966.11 IT CARVES UP THE HISTORY OF LIFE AND GIVES US THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE SEE IN THE DINOSAUR WORLD TOWARDS THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE BOLIDE IMPACT
PaulSereno_2005@966.45:975.29 THE BEST WAY TO TEST THIS IS TO ACTUALLY CREATE A MODEL SO IF WE MOVE BACK THIS IS A TWO DIMENSIONAL TYPICAL TREE OF LIFE I WANT TO GIVE YOU THREE DIMENSIONS SO
PaulSereno_2005@975.66:976.98 YOU SEE THE TREE OF LIFE
PaulSereno_2005@977.66:984.12 BUT NOW I'VE ADDED THE DIMENSION OF AREA SO THE TREE OF LIFE IS NORMALLY DIVERGENCE OVER TIME
PaulSereno_2005@984.59:994.43 NOW WE HAVE DIVERGENCE OVER TIME BUT WE'VE CREATED THE THIRD DIMENSION OF AREA THIS IS A COMPUTER PROGRAM WHICH HAS THREE KNOBS WE CAN CONTROL THOSE THINGS THAT WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT EXTINCTION
PaulSereno_2005@995.22:997.37 SAMPLING DISPERSAL
PaulSereno_2005@997.57:1012.24 GOING FROM ONE AREA TO ANOTHER AND ULTIMATELY WE CAN CONTROL THE BRANCHING TO MIMIC WHAT WE THINK THE CONTINENTS WERE LIKE AND RUN IT A THOUSAND TIMES SO WE CAN ESTIMATE THE PARAMETERS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHETHER WE ARE ON THE MARK OR NOT AT LEAST TO KNOW
PaulSereno_2005@1012.65:1025.28 THE BARRIERS OF THE PROBLEMS SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SCIENCE TODAY I'M GOING TO SPEND THE REST OF MY FEW MINUTES UP HERE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER STUFF THAT I DO IN CHICAGO WHICH IS RELATED TO THE FACT THAT I NEVER AND ACTUALLY IN TALKING TO A LOT OF TEDSTERS
PaulSereno_2005@1046.66:1058.69 NEARLY KILLED ME I FOUND MYSELF IN ART I WAS A TOTAL FAILURE IN SCHOOL NOT REALLY HEADED TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL AND I WENT ON THAT'S MY FIRST PAINTING ON CANVAS I READ A DICTIONARY I GOT INTO COLLEGE I BECAME AN ARTIST OK AND STARTED DRAWING
PaulSereno_2005@1059.17:1071.99 IT BECAME ABSTRACT I WORKED UP A PORTFOLIO AND I WAS HEADED TO NEW YORK SOMETIMES I WOULD SEE BONES WHEN THERE WAS A BODY THERE SOMETHING WAS GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND I HEADED TO NEW YORK TO A STUDIO I TOOK A SIDE TRIP TO THE AMERICAN MUSEUM AND I NEVER RECOVERED
PaulSereno_2005@1073.55:1085.13 BUT REALLY IT'S THE SAME DISCIPLINE THEY'RE KINDRED DISCIPLINES I MEAN IS THERE ANYTHING THAT IS NOT VISUALIZING WHAT CAN'T BE SEEN IN TERMS OF DISCOVERING THIS DINOSAUR BONE FROM A SMALL PIECE OF IT THAT'S OUT THERE OR
PaulSereno_2005@1096.42:1107.32 DINOSAURS THEY'RE REALLY KINDRED DISCIPLINES BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE IN CHICAGO IS A WAY TO GET COLLECT TOGETHER
PaulSereno_2005@1107.75:1116.49 THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE LEAST REPRESENTED IN OUR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SPHERES WE ALL KNOW AND THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL ALLUSIONS TO IT THAT WE ARE FAILING
PaulSereno_2005@1116.71:1125.84 IN OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE ENOUGH SCIENTISTS ENGINEERS AND TECHNICIANS WE'VE KNOWN THAT FOR A LONG TIME WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE SPUTNIK PHASE AND NOW AS YOU SEE THE INCREASE
PaulSereno_2005@1136.01:1144.05 ALL THE KIDS LIKE ME THAT WERE IN SCHOOL KIDS LIKE SOME OF YOU OUT THERE THAT WERE IN SCHOOL AND DIDN'T GET A CHANCE AND WILL NEVER GET A CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
PaulSereno_2005@1144.79:1152.29 THE QUESTIONS I ASK AND WE TALK ABOUT ETHIOPIA AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT NIGER IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT AND I'M TRYING DESPERATELY TO DO SOMETHING IN NIGER THEY HAVE AN AIDS PROBLEM
PaulSereno_2005@1160.55:1168.64 GIVE US A MUSEUM OF DINOSAURS AND WE WILL ATTRACT TOURISTS WHICH IS OUR NUMBER TWO INDUSTRY AND I HOPE TO GOD THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT ME OR
PaulSereno_2005@1189.80:1197.20 AN ORGANIZATION A NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION CALLED PROJECT EXPLORATION THESE ARE TWO KIDS FROM PROJECT EXPLORATION WE MET THEM IN THEIR EARLY STAGES IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY WERE
PaulSereno_2005@1197.69:1205.86 FAILING TO POOR STUDENTS AND THEY ARE NOW ONE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO ANOTHER IN ILLINOIS WE'VE GOT STUDENTS AT HARVARD WE'RE SIX YEARS OLD
PaulSereno_2005@1206.25:1217.89 AND WE CREATED A TRACK RECORD BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO OUT THERE AS A SCHOLAR AND YOU TRY TO FIND OUT LONGITUDINAL STUDIES TRACK RECORDS LIKE THAT THERE ESSENTIALLY ARE VERY FEW IF NONE SO WE'VE CREATED AN INCREDIBLE TRACK RECORD OF ONE HUNDRED PERCENT GRADUATION
PaulSereno_2005@1235.24:1248.95 SCIENCE AS AN INQUIRY WHICH WAS A BIG ADVANCE AND DEWEY BACK AT CHICAGO YOU LEARN BY DOING TO YOU LEARN BY ENVISIONING YOURSELF AS A SCIENTIST
PaulSereno_2005@1249.61:1260.99 AND THEN YOU LEARN TO ENVISION YOURSELF AS A SCIENTIST THE NEXT STEP IS TO LEARN THE CAPABILITY TO MAKE YOURSELF A SCIENTIST YOU HAVE TO HAVE THOSE STEPS IF YOU HAVE IT'S EASY TO GET KIDS INTERESTED IN SCIENCE
PaulSereno_2005@1261.48:1273.65 IT'S HARD TO GET THEM TO ENVISION THEMSELVES AS A SCIENTIST WHICH INVOLVES STANDING UP IN FRONT OF PEOPLE LIKE WE'RE DOING HERE AT THIS SYMPOSIUM AND PRESENTING SOMETHING AS A KNOWLEDGEABLE PERSON AND THEN SEEING YOURSELF IN THE ROLE AS A SCIENTIST AND
PaulSereno_2005@1286.88:1295.44 PART MUSEUM HALL PART CONSERVATORY PART ZOO AND PART OF AN ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM OF HOW YOU INTEREST KIDS IN SCIENCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
