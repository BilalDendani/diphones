JanineBenyus_2009G I
JanineBenyus_2009G ANYTHING THAT IS HIDDEN FROM US AT LEAST IN MODERN CULTURES IT WOULD BE
JanineBenyus_2009G TO REVEAL SOMETHING THAT WE'VE FORGOTTEN THAT WE USED TO KNOW AS WELL AS WE KNEW OUR OWN NAMES
JanineBenyus_2009G AND THAT IS THAT WE LIVE IN A COMPETENT UNIVERSE THAT WE ARE PART OF A BRILLIANT PLANET AND THAT WE ARE SURROUNDED BY GENIUS
JanineBenyus_2009G THAT'S WHERE I LIVE AND IT'S MY UNIVERSITY AS WELL I'M SURROUNDED BY GENIUS I CAN NOT HELP BUT
JanineBenyus_2009G THIS IS WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU TO REMEMBER IF YOU EVER FORGET THIS AGAIN REMEMBER THIS
JanineBenyus_2009G THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS EVERY YEAR THIS IS WHAT KEEPS ITS PROMISE
JanineBenyus_2009G DOING BAILOUTS THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED
JanineBenyus_2009G SPRING IMAGINE DESIGNING SPRING
JanineBenyus_2009G DO IMAGINE
JanineBenyus_2009G THE TIMING THE COORDINATION ALL WITHOUT TOP DOWN LAWS OR POLICIES OR CLIMATE CHANGE PROTOCOLS
JanineBenyus_2009G THIS HAPPENS EVERY YEAR THERE IS LOTS OF
JanineBenyus_2009G SHOWING OFF THERE IS LOTS OF LOVE IN THE AIR
JanineBenyus_2009G THAT KEEPS ME IN TOUCH WITH THIS BECAUSE HE 'S LIVING USUALLY ON HIS BACK LOOKING UP AT THOSE GRASSES AND
JanineBenyus_2009G ONE TIME HE CAME UP TO ME HE WAS ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS OLD HE CAME UP TO ME AND THERE WAS A WASP 'S NEST THAT I HAD LET GROW IN MY YARD RIGHT OUTSIDE MY DOOR
JanineBenyus_2009G AND MOST PEOPLE KNOCK THEM DOWN WHEN THEY'RE SMALL BUT IT WAS FASCINATING TO ME BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING AT THIS SORT OF FINE ITALIAN END PAPERS AND
JanineBenyus_2009G HE CAME UP TO ME AND HE KNOCKED HE WOULD COME EVERY DAY WITH SOMETHING TO SHOW ME AND LIKE KNOCK LIKE A WOODPECKER ON MY DOOR UNTIL I OPENED IT UP
JanineBenyus_2009G AND HE ASKED ME HOW I HAD MADE THE HOUSE FOR THOSE
JanineBenyus_2009G AND I COULD SEE WHY HE THOUGHT YOU KNOW IT WAS SO BEAUTIFULLY DONE IT WAS SO ARCHETECTURAL IT WAS SO PRECISE
JanineBenyus_2009G BUT IT OCCURRED TO ME HOW IN HIS SMALL LIFE HAD HE ALREADY BELIEVED THE MYTH THAT IF SOMETHING WAS THAT WELL DONE THAT WE MUST HAVE DONE IT
JanineBenyus_2009G HOW DID HE NOT KNOW IT'S WHAT WE'VE ALL FORGOTTEN THAT WE'RE NOT THE FIRST ONES TO BUILD
JanineBenyus_2009G WE'RE NOT THE FIRST ONES TO PROCESS CELLULOSE WE'RE NOT THE FIRST ONES TO MAKE PAPER WE'RE NOT THE FIRST ONES TO TRY TO OPTIMIZE PACKING SPACE OR TO WATERPROOF OR TO TRY TO HEAT AND COOL A STRUCTURE WE'RE NOT
JanineBenyus_2009G THE FIRST ONES TO BUILD HOUSES FOR OUR YOUNG WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IN THIS FIELD CALLED BIOMIMICRY IS THAT PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO REMEMBER THAT ORGANISMS
JanineBenyus_2009G OTHER ORGANISMS THE REST OF THE NATURAL WORLD ARE DOING THINGS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE NEED TO DO
JanineBenyus_2009G BUT IN FACT THEY ARE DOING THEM IN A WAY THAT HAVE ALLOWED THEM TO LIVE GRACEFULLY ON THIS PLANET FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS SO
JanineBenyus_2009G THESE PEOPLE BIOMIMICS ARE NATURE 'S APPRENTICES AND THEY'RE FOCUSING ON FUNCTION WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS SHOW YOU A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE LEARNING
JanineBenyus_2009G THEY HAVE ASKED THEMSELVES WHAT IF EVERY TIME I STARTED TO INVENT SOMETHING I ASKED HOW WOULD NATURE SOLVE THIS
JanineBenyus_2009G AND HERE IS WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING THIS IS AN AMAZING PICTURE FROM A CZECH PHOTOGRAPHER NAMED JACK HEDLEY THIS IS A STORY ABOUT AN ENGINEER AT JR WEST THEY'RE THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE BULLET TRAIN IT
JanineBenyus_2009G HE HAPPENED TO BE A BIRDER HE WENT TO THE EQUIVALENT OF AN AUDUBON SOCIETY MEETING AND HE STUDIED THERE WAS A FILM ABOUT KING FISHERS AND HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THEY GO FROM ONE DENSITY OF MEDIUM THE AIR INTO ANOTHER DENSITY OF MEDIUM WATER
JanineBenyus_2009G WITHOUT A SPLASH LOOK AT THIS PICTURE WITHOUT A SPLASH SO THEY CAN SEE THE FISH AND HE THOUGHT WHAT IF WE DO THIS
JanineBenyus_2009G HOW DOES NATURE REPEL BACTERIA WE'RE NOT THE FIRST ONES TO HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM SOME BACTERIA TURNS OUT THAT THIS IS A GALAPAGOS SHARK
JanineBenyus_2009G IT HAS NO BACTERIA ON ITS SURFACE NO FOULING ON ITS SURFACE NO BARNACLES AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT GOES FAST IT ACTUALLY BASKS IT'S A SLOW MOVING SHARK SO HOW DOES IT KEEP ITS BODY FREE OF BACTERIA BUILD UP
JanineBenyus_2009G IT DOESN'T DO IT WITH A CHEMICAL IT DOES IT IT TURNS OUT WITH THE SAME DENTICLES THAT YOU HAD ON SPEEDO BATHING SUITS THAT BROKE ALL THOSE RECORDS IN THE OLYMPICS BUT IT'S A PARTICULAR KIND OF PATTERN
JanineBenyus_2009G AND THAT PATTERN THE ARCHITECTURE OF THAT PATTERN ON ITS SKIN DENTICLES KEEP BACTERIA FROM BEING ABLE TO LAND AND
JanineBenyus_2009G A COMPANY CALLED SHARKLET TECHNOLOGIES THAT'S NOW PUTTING THIS ON THE SURFACES IN HOSPITALS TO KEEP BACTERIA FROM LANDING WHICH IS
JanineBenyus_2009G BETTER THAN DOUSING IT WITH ANTI BACTERIALS OR HARSH CLEANSERS THAT MANY MANY ORGANISMS ARE NOW BECOMING DRUG RESISTANT
JanineBenyus_2009G THIS IS A LITTLE CRITTER THAT'S IN THE NAMIBIAN DESERT IT HAS NO FRESH WATER THAT IT'S ABLE TO DRINK BUT IT DRINKS WATER OUT OF FOG IT'S GOT BUMPS ON THE BACK OF ITS WING COVERS
JanineBenyus_2009G AND THOSE BUMPS ACT LIKE A MAGNET FOR WATER THEY HAVE WATER LOVING TIPS AND WAXY SIDES AND THE FOG COMES IN AND IT BUILDS UP ON THE TIPS AND IT GOES DOWN THE SIDES AND GOES INTO THE CRITTER 'S MOUTH
JanineBenyus_2009G ACTUALLY A SCIENTIST HERE AT OXFORD WHO STUDIED THIS ANDREW PARKER AND NOW KINETIC AND ARCHITECTURAL FIRMS LIKE GRIMSHAW
JanineBenyus_2009G ARE STARTING TO LOOK AT THIS AS A WAY OF COATING BUILDINGS SO THAT THEY GATHER WATER FROM THE FOG TEN TIMES BETTER THAN OUR FOG CATCHING NETS
JanineBenyus_2009G TWO AS A BUILDING BLOCK ORGANISMS DON'T THINK OF CO TWO AS A POISON PLANTS AND ORGANISMS THAT MAKE SHELLS CORAL THINK OF IT AS A BUILDING BLOCK THERE IS NOW A CEMENT MANUFACTURING
JanineBenyus_2009G CEMENT IN CONCRETE INSTEAD OF CEMENT USUALLY EMITS A TON OF CO TWO FOR EVERY TON OF CEMENT NOW IT'S REVERSING THAT EQUATION AND ACTUALLY SEQUESTERING HALF
JanineBenyus_2009G OF CO TWO THANKS TO THE RECIPE FROM THE CORAL NONE OF THESE ARE USING THE ORGANISMS THEY'RE REALLY ONLY USING THE BLUEPRINTS OR THE RECIPES FROM THE ORGANISMS
JanineBenyus_2009G THERE ARE MANY MANY WAYS THAT NATURE FILTERS WATER THAT TAKES SALT OUT OF WATER WE TAKE WATER AND PUSH IT AGAINST A MEMBRANE
JanineBenyus_2009G AND THEN WE WONDER WHY THE MEMBRANE CLOGS AND WHY IT TAKES SO MUCH ELECTRICITY NATURE DOES SOMETHING MUCH MORE ELEGANT AND IT'S IN EVERY CELL
JanineBenyus_2009G EVERY RED BLOOD CELL OF YOUR BODY RIGHT NOW HAS THESE HOURGLASS SHAPED PORES CALLED AQUAPORINS THEY ACTUALLY EXPORT WATER MOLECULES THROUGH IT'S KIND OF A FORWARD OSMOSIS THEY EXPORT WATER MOLECULES THROUGH
JanineBenyus_2009G AND LEAVE SOLUTES ON THE OTHER SIDE A COMPANY CALLED AQUAPORIN IS STARTING TO MAKE DESALINATION MEMBRANES MIMICKING THIS TECHNOLOGY
JanineBenyus_2009G TREES AND BONES ARE CONSTANTLY REFORMING THEMSELVES ALONG LINES OF STRESS THIS ALGORITHM HAS BEEN PUT INTO A SOFTWARE PROGRAM
JanineBenyus_2009G THAT SKELETON YOU SEE IN WHAT'S CALLED THEIR BIONIC CAR IT LIGHTWEIGHTED THAT SKELETON USING A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF MATERIAL AS AN ORGANISM MUST FOR THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF STRENGTH
JanineBenyus_2009G THIS BEETLE UNLIKE THIS CHIP BAG HERE THIS BEETLE USES ONE MATERIAL
JanineBenyus_2009G AND IT FINDS MANY MANY WAYS TO PUT MANY FUNCTIONS INTO IT IT'S WATERPROOF IT'S STRONG AND RESILIENT IT'S BREATHABLE IT CREATES COLOR THROUGH STRUCTURE
JanineBenyus_2009G IS TO FIND A WAY TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL THE KIND OF MATERIAL WE USE AND TO ADD DESIGN TO IT
JanineBenyus_2009G WE USE FIVE POLYMERS IN THE NATURAL WORLD TO DO EVERYTHING THAT YOU SEE IN OUR WORLD WE USE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POLYMERS TO MAKE ALL
JanineBenyus_2009G NATURE IS NANO
JanineBenyus_2009G YOU HEAR A LOT OF WORRY ABOUT THIS LOOSE NANOPARTICLES WHAT IS REALLY INTERESTING TO ME
JanineBenyus_2009G IS THAT NOT MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING HOW CAN WE CONSULT NATURE ABOUT HOW TO MAKE NANOTECHNOLOGY SAFE
JanineBenyus_2009G BUT THEN RIGHT AFTER THAT THEY EMIT A PROTEIN THAT ACTUALLY GATHERS AND AGGREGATES THOSE NANOPARTICLES SO THAT THEY FALL OUT OF SOLUTION
JanineBenyus_2009G ENERGY USE ORGANISMS SIP ENERGY BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO WORK OR BARTER FOR EVERY SINGLE BIT THAT THEY
JanineBenyus_2009G AND ONE OF THE LARGEST FIELDS RIGHT NOW IN THE WORLD OF ENERGY GRIDS YOU HEAR ABOUT THE SMART GRID
JanineBenyus_2009G ONE OF THE LARGEST CONSULTANTS ARE THE SOCIAL INSECTS SWARM TECHNOLOGY THERE IS A COMPANY CALLED REGEN THEY ARE LOOKING AT HOW
JanineBenyus_2009G ANTS AND BEES FIND THEIR FOOD AND THEIR FLOWERS IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY AS A WHOLE HIVE
JanineBenyus_2009G AND THEY'RE HAVING APPLIANCES IN YOUR HOME TALK TO ONE ANOTHER THROUGH THAT ALGORITHM AND DETERMINE HOW TO MINIMIZE PEAK POWER USE
JanineBenyus_2009G IT'S CAPILLARY ACTION AND TRANSPIRATION PULLS WATER UP A DROP AT A TIME PULLING IT RELEASING FROM A LEAF AND PULLING IT UP THROUGH THE ROOTS AND THEY'RE CREATING
JanineBenyus_2009G YOU CAN THINK OF IT AS A KIND OF WALLPAPER THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT PUTTING IT ON THE INSIDES OF BUILDINGS TO MOVE WATER UP WITHOUT PUMPS
JanineBenyus_2009G EVEN MORE INTERESTING TO ME IS THAT SIX HUNDRED VOLTS DOESN'T FRY IT YOU KNOW WE USE PVC
JanineBenyus_2009G SHEATH WIRES WITH PVC FOR INSULATION THESE ORGANISMS HOW ARE THEY INSULATING AGAINST THEIR OWN ELECTRIC CHARGE
JanineBenyus_2009G THESE ARE SOME QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE YET TO ASK HERE 'S A WIND TURBINE MANUFACTURER THAT WENT TO A WHALE HUMPBACK WHALE HAS
JanineBenyus_2009G HAS A NEW RADIO CHIP THAT USES FAR LESS POWER THAN OUR CHIPS AND IT'S BASED ON THE COCHLEAR
JanineBenyus_2009G OF YOU EAR ABLE TO PICK UP INTERNET WIRELESS TELEVISION SIGNALS AND RADIO SIGNALS IN THE SAME CHIP FINALLY ON AN ECOSYSTEM SCALE
JanineBenyus_2009G AT BIOMIMICRY GUILD WHICH IS MY CONSULTING COMPANY WE WORK WITH HOK ARCHITECTS WE'RE LOOKING AT
JanineBenyus_2009G BUILDING WHOLE CITIES IN THEIR PLANNING DEPARTMENT AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT SHOULDN 'T OUR CITIES DO AT LEAST AS WELL IN TERMS OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
JanineBenyus_2009G AS THE NATIVE SYSTEMS THAT THEY REPLACE SO WE'RE CREATING SOMETHING CALLED ECOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS THAT HOLD CITIES TO THIS HIGHER BAR
JanineBenyus_2009G THE QUESTION IS BIOMIMICRY IS AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL WAY TO INNOVATE THE QUESTION I WOULD ASK IS WHAT 'S WORTH SOLVING
JanineBenyus_2009G IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS IT'S PRETTY AMAZING DOCTOR ADAM NEIMAN THIS IS A DEPICTION
JanineBenyus_2009G OF ALL OF THE WATER ON EARTH IN RELATION TO THE VOLUME OF THE EARTH ALL THE ICE ALL THE FRESH WATER ALL THE SEA WATER AND ALL THE ATMOSPHERE THAT WE CAN BREATHE IN RELATION TO THE VOLUME OF THE EARTH AND INSIDE THOSE BALLS
JanineBenyus_2009G LIFE OVER THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION YEARS HAS MADE A LUSH LIVABLE PLACE FOR US
JanineBenyus_2009G AND WE ARE IN A LONG LONG LINE OF ORGANISMS TO COME TO THIS PLANET AND ASK OURSELVES HOW CAN WE LIVE HERE GRACEFULLY OVER THE LONG HAUL HOW CAN WE DO WHAT LIFE
JanineBenyus_2009G HAS LEARNED TO DO WHICH IS TO CREATE CONDITIONS CONDUCIVE TO LIFE NOW
JanineBenyus_2009G IN ORDER TO DO THIS THE DESIGN CHALLENGE OF OUR CENTURY I THINK WE NEED A WAY TO REMIND OURSELVES OF THOSE GENIUSES AND TO SOMEHOW MEET THEM AGAIN
JanineBenyus_2009G ONE OF THE BIG IDEAS ONE OF THE BIG PROJECTS I'VE BEEN HONORED TO WORK ON IS A NEW WEBSITE AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO PLEASE GO TO IT IT'S CALLED ASKNATURE ORG
JanineBenyus_2009G AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN A TEDESQUE WAY IS TO ORGANIZE ALL BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION BY DESIGN AND ENGINEERING FUNCTION
JanineBenyus_2009G AND WE'RE WORKING WITH EOL ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF LIFE ED WILSON 'S TED WISH AND HE 'S GATHERING ALL BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION ON ONE WEBSITE
JanineBenyus_2009G AND HOPEFULLY ANY INVENTOR ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WILL BE ABLE IN THE MOMENT OF CREATION TO TYPE IN HOW DOES NATURE
JanineBenyus_2009G REMOVE SALT FROM WATER AND UP WILL COME MANGROVES AND SEA TURTLES AND YOUR OWN KIDNEYS AND WE'LL BEGIN TO
JanineBenyus_2009G BE ABLE TO DO AS CODY DOES AND ACTUALLY BE IN TOUCH WITH THESE INCREDIBLE MODELS THESE ELDERS THAT HAVE BEEN HERE FAR FAR
JanineBenyus_2009G THAN WE HAVE AND HOPEFULLY WITH THEIR HELP WE'LL LEARN HOW TO LIVE ON THIS EARTH AND ON THIS HOME THAT IS OURS BUT NOT OURS ALONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
