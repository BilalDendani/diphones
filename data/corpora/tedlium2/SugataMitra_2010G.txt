SugataMitra_2010G@17.89:23.01 KIND OF AN OBVIOUS STATEMENT UP THERE I STARTED WITH THAT SENTENCE ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO
SugataMitra_2010G@23.58:33.81 I STARTED IN THE CONTEXT OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BUT YOU'RE SITTING HERE FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD SO IF YOU THINK OF A MAP OF YOUR COUNTRY
SugataMitra_2010G@34.26:40.69 I THINK YOU'LL REALIZE THAT FOR EVERY COUNTRY ON EARTH YOU COULD DRAW LITTLE CIRCLES TO SAY THESE ARE PLACES WHERE
SugataMitra_2010G@43.85:54.68 ON TOP OF THAT THOSE ARE THE PLACES FROM WHERE TROUBLE COMES SO WE HAVE AN IRONIC PROBLEM GOOD TEACHERS DON'T WANT TO GO TO JUST THOSE PLACES WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED THE MOST
SugataMitra_2010G@64.52:70.17 I BASICALLY EMBEDDED A COMPUTER INTO A WALL OF
SugataMitra_2010G@71.50:78.20 IN NEW DELHI THE CHILDREN BARELY WENT TO SCHOOL THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANY ENGLISH THEY'D NEVER SEEN A COMPUTER BEFORE
SugataMitra_2010G@78.77:90.38 AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE INTERNET WAS I CONNECTED HIGH SPEED INTERNET TO IT IT'S ABOUT THREE FEET OFF THE GROUND TURNED IT ON AND LEFT IT THERE AFTER THIS WE NOTICED A COUPLE OF INTERESTING THINGS WHICH
SugataMitra_2010G@91.86:99.51 BUT I REPEATED THIS ALL OVER INDIA AND THEN THROUGH A LARGE PART OF THE WORLD AND NOTICED THAT
SugataMitra_2010G@100.43:109.49 CHILDREN WILL LEARN TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO LEARN TO DO THIS IS THE FIRST EXPERIMENT THAT WE DID EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY ON YOUR RIGHT
SugataMitra_2010G@110.10:117.82 TEACHING HIS STUDENT A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL AND HE WAS TEACHING HER HOW TO BROWSE THIS BOY HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF
SugataMitra_2010G@121.69:128.59 VILLAGE WHERE THE CHILDREN RECORDED THEIR OWN MUSIC AND THEN PLAYED IT BACK TO EACH OTHER
SugataMitra_2010G@129.00:139.59 AND IN THE PROCESS THEY'VE ENJOYED THEMSELVES THOROUGHLY THEY DID ALL OF THIS IN FOUR HOURS AFTER SEEING THE COMPUTER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ANOTHER SOUTH INDIAN VILLAGE
SugataMitra_2010G@140.51:152.62 THESE BOYS HERE HAD ASSEMBLED A VIDEO CAMERA AND WERE TRYING TO TAKE THE PHOTOGRAPH OF A BUMBLE BEE THEY DOWNLOADED IT FROM DISNEY COM OR ONE OF THESE WEBSITES FOURTEEN DAYS AFTER PUTTING THE COMPUTER
SugataMitra_2010G@161.20:171.68 LEARN TO USE COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET ON THEIR OWN IRRESPECTIVE OF WHO OR WHERE THEY WERE AT THAT POINT I BECAME A LITTLE MORE AMBITIOUS
SugataMitra_2010G@172.15:180.68 AND DECIDED TO SEE WHAT ELSE COULD CHILDREN DO WITH A COMPUTER WE STARTED OFF WITH AN EXPERIMENT IN HYDERABAD INDIA
SugataMitra_2010G@181.27:192.95 I GAVE A GROUP OF CHILDREN THEY SPOKE ENGLISH WITH A VERY STRONG TELUGU ACCENT I GAVE THEM A COMPUTER WITH A SPEECH TO TEXT INTERFACE WHICH YOU NOW GET FREE WITH WINDOWS
SugataMitra_2010G@193.57:206.57 AND ASKED THEM TO SPEAK INTO IT SO WHEN THEY SPOKE INTO IT THE COMPUTER TYPED OUT GIBBERISH SO THEY SAID WELL IT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING OF WHAT WE ARE SAYING SO I SAID YEAH I'LL LEAVE IT HERE FOR TWO MONTHS MAKE YOURSELF UNDERSTOOD TO THE COMPUTER
SugataMitra_2010G@207.37:212.71 SO THE CHILDREN SAID HOW DO WE DO THAT AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY
SugataMitra_2010G@215.46:215.87 AND I
SugataMitra_2010G@221.29:229.78 TWO MONTHS LATER AND THIS IS NOW DOCUMENTED IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL THAT ACCENTS HAD CHANGED
SugataMitra_2010G@241.28:249.10 SO THEY COULD DO THAT ON THEIR OWN AFTER THAT I STARTED TO EXPERIMENT WITH VARIOUS OTHER THINGS THAT THEY MIGHT LEARN TO DO ON THEIR OWN
SugataMitra_2010G@250.07:256.39 I GOT AN INTERESTING PHONE CALL ONCE FROM COLUMBO FROM THE LATE ARTHUR C CLARKE WHO SAID I WANT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
SugataMitra_2010G@256.86:264.55 AND HE COULDN'T TRAVEL SO I WENT OVER THERE HE SAID TWO INTERESTING THINGS A TEACHER THAT CAN BE REPLACED BY A MACHINE SHOULD BE
SugataMitra_2010G@267.16:274.19 THE SECOND THING HE SAID WAS THAT IF CHILDREN HAVE INTEREST THEN EDUCATION HAPPENS
SugataMitra_2010G@275.63:279.11 AND I WAS DOING THAT IN THE FIELD SO EVERY TIME I WOULD WATCH IT AND
SugataMitra_2010G@292.73:296.55 I TOOK THE EXPERIMENT TO SOUTH AFRICA THIS IS A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOY
SugataMitra_2010G@305.71:306.38 I
SugataMitra_2010G@307.02:311.53 AND I ASKED HIM DO YOU SEND EMAILS AND HE SAID YES AND THEY HOP ACROSS THE OCEAN
SugataMitra_2010G@313.47:319.92 IN CAMBODIA RURAL CAMBODIA A FAIRLY SILLY ARITHMETIC
SugataMitra_2010G@321.47:327.73 WOULD PLAY INSIDE THE CLASSROOM OR AT HOME THEY WOULD YOU KNOW THROW IT BACK AT YOU THEY'D SAY THIS IS VERY BORING IF YOU LEAVE IT ON THE PAVEMENT
SugataMitra_2010G@329.30:329.91 THE ADULTS
SugataMitra_2010G@339.68:341.08 AND ALL OVER INDIA
SugataMitra_2010G@341.92:348.83 AT THE END OF ABOUT TWO YEARS CHILDREN WERE BEGINNING TO GOOGLE THEIR HOMEWORK AS A RESULT THE TEACHERS REPORTED
SugataMitra_2010G@349.33:358.64 TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR ENGLISH RAPID IMPROVEMENT AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS THEY SAID THEY HAVE BECOME REALLY DEEP THINKERS AND SO ON
SugataMitra_2010G@360.30:367.91 AND SO FORTH AND INDEED THEY HAD I MEAN IF THERE'S STUFF ON GOOGLE WHY WOULD YOU NEED TO STUFF
SugataMitra_2010G@370.64:382.44 SO AT THE END OF THE NEXT FOUR YEARS I DECIDED THAT GROUPS OF CHILDREN CAN NAVIGATE THE INTERNET TO ACHIEVE EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES ON THEIR OWN AT THAT TIME A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY HAD COME INTO NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY
SugataMitra_2010G@383.17:393.29 TO IMPROVE SCHOOLING IN INDIA SO NEWCASTLE GAVE ME A CALL I SAID I 'LL DO IT FROM DELHI THEY SAID THERE 'S NO WAY YOU'RE GOING TO HANDLE A MILLION POUNDS WORTH OF UNIVERSITY MONEY
SugataMitra_2010G@394.43:400.89 SITTING IN DELHI SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX I BOUGHT MYSELF A HEAVY OVERCOAT AND MOVED TO
SugataMitra_2010G@402.92:412.64 I WANTED TO TEST THE LIMITS OF THE SYSTEM THE FIRST EXPERIMENT I DID OUT OF NEWCASTLE WAS ACTUALLY DONE IN INDIA AND I SET MYSELF AND IMPOSSIBLE
SugataMitra_2010G@414.10:425.42 CAN TAMIL SPEAKING TWELVE YEAR OLD CHILDREN IN A SOUTH INDIAN VILLAGE TEACH THEMSELVES BIOTECHNOLOGY IN ENGLISH ON THEIR OWN
SugataMitra_2010G@426.00:437.05 AND I THOUGHT I'LL TEST THEM THEY'LL GET A ZERO I'LL GIVE THE MATERIALS I'LL COME BACK AND TEST THEM THEY GET ANOTHER ZERO I'LL GO BACK AND SAY YES WE NEED TEACHERS FOR CERTAIN THINGS I
SugataMitra_2010G@437.42:448.35 IN TWENTY SIX CHILDREN THEY ALL CAME IN THERE AND I TOLD THEM THAT THERE'S SOME REALLY DIFFICULT STUFF ON THIS COMPUTER I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING IT'S ALL IN ENGLISH AND I'M GOING
SugataMitra_2010G@451.36:456.85 THEM WITH IT I CAME BACK AFTER TWO MONTHS AND THE TWENTY SIX CHILDREN MARCHED IN LOOKING VERY VERY QUIET I SAID
SugataMitra_2010G@457.84:465.96 DID YOU LOOK AT ANY OF THE STUFF THEY SAID YES WE DID DID YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING NO NOTHING SO I SAID WELL
SugataMitra_2010G@466.65:477.79 HOW LONG DID YOU PRACTICE ON IT BEFORE YOU DECIDED YOU UNDERSTOOD NOTHING THEY SAID WE LOOK AT IT EVERY DAY SO I SAID FOR TWO MONTHS YOU WERE LOOKING AT STUFF YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SO A TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRL RAISES HER HAND AND SAYS
SugataMitra_2010G@480.52:486.88 APART FROM THE FACT THAT IMPROPER REPLICATION OF THE DNA MOLECULE CAUSES GENETIC DISEASE WE'VE UNDERSTOOD NOTHING
SugataMitra_2010G@510.36:515.87 WHICH WAS NOT VERY NICE WELL ONE OF THE GIRLS HAD TAUGHT HERSELF TO BECOME THE TEACHER
SugataMitra_2010G@516.46:517.68 AND THEN THAT'S HER OVER THERE
SugataMitra_2010G@527.64:528.19 ENGLISH
SugataMitra_2010G@542.32:550.28 THE LAST BIT WHEN I ASKED WHERE IS THE NEURON AND SHE SAYS THE NEURON THE NEURON AND THEN SHE LOOKED AND DID THIS WHATEVER THE EXPRESSION
SugataMitra_2010G@553.04:558.84 SO THEIR SCORES HAD GONE UP FROM ZERO TO THIRTY PERCENT WHICH IS AN EDUCATIONAL IMPOSSIBILITY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
SugataMitra_2010G@559.14:566.84 BUT THIRTY PERCENT IS NOT A PASS SO I FOUND THAT THEY HAD A FRIEND A LOCAL ACCOUNTANT A YOUNG GIRL AND THEY PLAYED FOOTBALL WITH
SugataMitra_2010G@567.88:576.06 I ASKED THAT GIRL WOULD YOU TEACH THEM ENOUGH BIOTECHNOLOGY TO PASS AND SHE SAID HOW WOULD I DO THAT I DON'T KNOW THE SUBJECT I SAID NO USE THE METHOD OF THE GRANDMOTHER
SugataMitra_2010G@576.76:583.40 SHE SAID WHAT 'S THAT I SAID WELL WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS STAND BEHIND THEM AND ADMIRE THEM ALL THE TIME
SugataMitra_2010G@584.46:595.86 SAY TO THEM THAT 'S COOL THAT'S FANTASTIC WHAT IS THAT CAN YOU DO THAT AGAIN CAN YOU SHOW ME SOME MORE SHE DID THAT FOR TWO MONTHS THE SCORES WENT UP TO FIFTY WHICH IS WHAT THE POSH SCHOOLS OF NEW DELHI WITH A TRAINED
SugataMitra_2010G@604.72:611.30 THERE WAS SOMETHING HAPPENING HERE THAT DEFINITELY WAS GETTING VERY SERIOUS SO
SugataMitra_2010G@612.78:616.77 ALL SORTS OF REMOTE PLACES I CAME TO THE MOST REMOTE PLACE THAT I COULD THINK OF
SugataMitra_2010G@620.39:627.08 FIVE THOUSAND MILES FROM DELHI IS THE LITTLE TOWN OF GATESHEAD IN GATESHEAD I TOOK THIRTY TWO CHILDREN
SugataMitra_2010G@627.72:640.22 AND I STARTED TO FINE TUNE THE METHOD I MADE THEM INTO GROUPS OF FOUR I SAID YOU MAKE YOUR OWN GROUPS OF FOUR EACH GROUP OF FOUR CAN USE ONE COMPUTER AND NOT FOUR COMPUTERS REMEMBER FROM THE HOLE IN THE WALL
SugataMitra_2010G@641.34:650.45 YOU CAN EXCHANGE GROUPS YOU CAN WALK ACROSS TO ANOTHER GROUP IF YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR GROUP ETC YOU CAN GO TO ANOTHER GROUP PEER OVER THEIR SHOULDERS SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING
SugataMitra_2010G@667.48:678.60 THE CHILDREN ENTHUSIASTICALLY GOT AFTER ME AND SAID NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO I GAVE THEM SIX GCSE QUESTIONS THE FIRST GROUP THE BEST ONE SOLVED EVERYTHING IN TWENTY MINUTES
SugataMitra_2010G@679.01:686.70 THE WORST IN FORTY FIVE THEY USED EVERYTHING THAT THEY KNEW NEWS GROUPS GOOGLE WIKIPEDIA ASK JEEVES ETC
SugataMitra_2010G@687.39:697.64 THE TEACHERS SAID IS THIS DEEP LEARNING I SAID WELL LET 'S TRY IT I'LL COME BACK AFTER TWO MONTHS WE'LL GIVE THEM A PAPER TEST NO COMPUTERS NO TALKING TO EACH OTHER ETC
SugataMitra_2010G@698.24:704.65 THE AVERAGE SCORE WHEN I'D DONE IT WITH THE COMPUTERS AND THE GROUPS WAS SEVENTY SIX PERCENT WHEN I DID THE EXPERIMENT WHEN I DID THE
SugataMitra_2010G@705.00:712.62 AFTER TWO MONTHS THE SCORE WAS SEVENTY SIX PERCENT THERE WAS PHOTOGRAPHIC
SugataMitra_2010G@712.98:721.22 RECALL INSIDE THE CHILDREN I SUSPECT BECAUSE THEY'RE DISCUSSING WITH EACH OTHER A SINGLE CHILD IN FRONT OF A SINGLE COMPUTER WILL NOT DO THAT
SugataMitra_2010G@721.76:733.78 I HAVE FURTHER RESULTS WHICH ARE ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE OF SCORES WHICH GO UP WITH TIME BECAUSE THEIR TEACHERS SAY THAT AFTER THE SESSION IS OVER THE CHILDREN CONTINUE TO GOOGLE FURTHER
SugataMitra_2010G@734.64:746.55 IN BRITAIN I PUT OUT A CALL FOR BRITISH GRANDMOTHERS AFTER MY KUPPAM EXPERIMENT WELL YOU KNOW THEY'RE VERY VIGOROUS PEOPLE BRITISH GRANDMOTHERS TWO HUNDRED OF THEM VOLUNTEERED
SugataMitra_2010G@749.34:754.03 THE DEAL WAS THAT THEY WOULD GIVE ME ONE HOUR OF BROADBAND TIME SITTING IN THEIR HOMES
SugataMitra_2010G@755.25:768.22 ONE DAY IN A WEEK SO THEY DID THAT AND OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS OVER SIX HUNDRED HOURS OF INSTRUCTION HAS HAPPENED OVER SKYPE USING WHAT MY STUDENTS CALL THE GRANNY CLOUD
SugataMitra_2010G@780.16:780.91 YOU
SugataMitra_2010G@804.26:813.21 BACK AT GATESHEAD A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL GETS INTO THE HEART OF HINDUISM IN FIFTEEN MINUTES YOU KNOW STUFF WHICH I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
SugataMitra_2010G@816.21:823.59 TWO CHILDREN WATCH A TEDTALK THEY WANTED TO BE FOOTBALLERS BEFORE AFTER WATCHING EIGHT TEDTALKS HE WANTS TO BECOME
SugataMitra_2010G@832.14:844.91 IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE STUFF THIS IS WHAT I'M BUILDING NOW THEY'RE CALLED SOLES SELF ORGANIZED LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS THE FURNITURE IS DESIGNED SO THAT CHILDREN CAN SIT IN FRONT OF BIG POWERFUL SCREENS BIG BROADBAND CONNECTIONS
SugataMitra_2010G@845.57:857.65 BUT IN GROUPS IF THEY WANT THEY CAN CALL THE GRANNY CLOUD THIS IS A SOLE IN NEWCASTLE THE MEDIATOR IS FROM INDIA SO HOW FAR CAN WE GO ONE LAST LITTLE BIT AND I'LL STOP I WENT TO TURIN
SugataMitra_2010G@858.08:866.18 IN MAY I SENT ALL THE TEACHERS AWAY FROM MY GROUP OF TEN YEAR OLD STUDENTS I SPEAK ONLY ENGLISH THEY SPEAK
SugataMitra_2010G@867.92:876.66 SO WE HAD NO WAY TO COMMUNICATE I STARTED WRITING ENGLISH QUESTIONS ON THE BLACKBOARD THE CHILDREN LOOKED AT IT AND SAID WHAT I SAID WELL DO IT
SugataMitra_2010G@893.28:898.78 NEXT QUESTION WHERE IS CALCUTTA THIS ONE
SugataMitra_2010G@904.97:909.88 I TRIED A REALLY HARD ONE THEN WHO WAS PYTHAGORAS AND WHAT DID HE DO
SugataMitra_2010G@912.50:917.35 WAS SILENCE FOR A WHILE THEN THEY SAID YOU 'VE SPELLED IT WRONG IT'S
SugataMitra_2010G@949.43:949.66 THE
SugataMitra_2010G@961.59:974.02 SO YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED I THINK WE'VE JUST STUMBLED ACROSS A SELF ORGANIZING SYSTEM A SELF ORGANIZING SYSTEM IS ONE WHERE A STRUCTURE APPEARS WITHOUT EXPLICIT INTERVENTION FROM THE OUTSIDE
SugataMitra_2010G@974.45:986.21 SELF ORGANIZING SYSTEMS ALSO ALWAYS SHOW EMERGENCE WHICH IS THAT THE SYSTEM STARTS TO DO THINGS WHICH IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED FOR WHICH IS WHY YOU REACT THE WAY YOU DO BECAUSE IT LOOKS IMPOSSIBLE
SugataMitra_2010G@986.72:999.94 I THINK I CAN MAKE A GUESS NOW EDUCATION IS SELF ORGANIZING SYSTEM WHERE LEARNING IS AN EMERGENT PHENOMENON IT'LL TAKE A FEW YEARS TO PROVE IT EXPERIMENTALLY BUT I'M GOING TO TRY BUT IN THE MEANWHILE THERE IS A METHOD AVAILABLE
SugataMitra_2010G@1000.91:1014.34 ONE BILLION CHILDREN WE NEED ONE HUNDRED MILLION MEDIATORS THERE ARE MANY MORE THAN THAT ON THE PLANET TEN MILLIONS SOLES ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY BILLION DOLLARS AND TEN YEARS WE COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING THANKS
