AmberCase_2010W BUT NOT THE CYBORGS THAT YOU THINK YOU 'RE NOT ROBOCOP AND YOU 'RE NOT TERMINATOR
AmberCase_2010W BUT YOU 'RE CYBORGS EVERY TIME YOU LOOK AT A COMPUTER SCREEN OR USE ONE OF YOUR CELL PHONE DEVICES SO WHAT 'S A GOOD DEFINITION FOR CYBORG WELL TRADITIONAL DEFINITION IS AN ORGANISM TO WHICH EXOGENOUS COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN ADDED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADAPTING TO NEW ENVIRONMENTS THAT CAME FROM A ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY PAPER ON SPACE TRAVEL BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT SPACE IS PRETTY AWKWARD
AmberCase_2010W PEOPLE AREN 'T SUPPOSED TO BE THERE BUT HUMANS ARE CURIOUS AND THEY LIKE TO
AmberCase_2010W SO LET 'S LOOK AT THE CONCEPT OF TRADITIONAL ANTHROPOLOGY SOMEBODY GOES TO ANOTHER COUNTRY SAYS HOW FASCINATING THESE PEOPLE ARE HOW INTERESTING THEIR TOOLS ARE HOW CURIOUS THEIR CULTURE IS AND THEN THEY WRITE A PAPER AND MAYBE A FEW OTHER ANTHROPOLOGISTS READ IT AND WE THINK IT 'S VERY EXOTIC WELL WHAT 'S HAPPENING IS THAT
AmberCase_2010W WE 'VE SUDDENLY FOUND A NEW SPECIES I AS A CYBORG ANTHROPOLOGIST HAVE SUDDENLY SAID OH WOW NOW SUDDENLY WE 'RE A NEW FORM OF HOMO SAPIENS AND LOOK AT THESE FASCINATING CULTURES AND LOOK AT THESE CURIOUS RITUALS THAT EVERYBODY 'S DOING AROUND THIS TECHNOLOGY THEY 'RE CLICKING ON THINGS AND STARING AT SCREENS
AmberCase_2010W NOW THERE 'S A REASON WHY I STUDY THIS VERSUS TRADITIONAL ANTHROPOLOGY AND THE REASON IS THAT TOOL USE
AmberCase_2010W IN THE BEGINNING FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS EVERYTHING HAS BEEN A PHYSICAL MODIFICATION OF SELF IT HAS HELPED US TO EXTEND OUR PHYSICAL SELVES GO FASTER HIT THINGS HARDER AND THERE 'S BEEN A LIMIT ON THAT BUT NOW WHAT WE 'RE LOOKING AT IS NOT AN EXTENSION OF THE PHYSICAL SELF BUT AN EXTENSION OF THE MENTAL SELF
AmberCase_2010W AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE 'RE ABLE TO TRAVEL FASTER COMMUNICATE DIFFERENTLY AND THE OTHER THING THAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE 'RE ALL CARRYING AROUND LITTLE MARY POPPINS TECHNOLOGY WE CAN PUT ANYTHING WE WANT INTO IT AND IT DOESN 'T GET HEAVIER AND THEN WE CAN TAKE ANYTHING OUT WHAT DOES THE INSIDE OF YOUR COMPUTER ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE
AmberCase_2010W WELL IF YOU PRINT IT OUT IT LOOKS LIKE A THOUSAND POUNDS OF MATERIAL THAT YOU 'RE CARRYING AROUND ALL THE TIME AND IF YOU ACTUALLY LOSE THAT INFORMATION IT MEANS THAT YOU SUDDENLY HAVE THIS LOSS
AmberCase_2010W AND SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT LEAVING YOUR FRONT LAWN OPEN WHICH IS BASICALLY YOUR FACEBOOK WALL SO THAT PEOPLE DON 'T WRITE ON IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BECAUSE IT 'S VERY MUCH THE EQUIVALENT
AmberCase_2010W AND SUDDENLY WE HAVE TO START TO MAINTAIN OUR SECOND SELF YOU HAVE TO PRESENT YOURSELF IN DIGITAL LIFE IN A SIMILAR WAY THAT YOU WOULD IN YOUR ANALOG LIFE SO IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU WAKE UP TAKE A SHOWER AND GET DRESSED YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO DO THAT FOR YOUR DIGITAL SELF AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE NOW ESPECIALLY ADOLESCENTS HAVE TO GO THROUGH TWO ADOLESCENCES
AmberCase_2010W THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THEIR PRIMARY ONE THAT 'S ALREADY AWKWARD AND THEN THEY GO THROUGH THEIR SECOND SELF 'S ADOLESCENCE
AmberCase_2010W AND THAT 'S EVEN MORE AWKWARD BECAUSE THERE 'S AN ACTUAL HISTORY OF WHAT THEY 'VE GONE THROUGH ONLINE AND ANYBODY COMING IN NEW TO TECHNOLOGY IS AN ADOLESCENT ONLINE RIGHT NOW AND SO IT 'S VERY AWKWARD AND IT 'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DO THOSE THINGS
AmberCase_2010W SO WHEN I WAS LITTLE MY DAD WOULD SIT ME DOWN AT NIGHT AND HE WOULD SAY I 'M GOING TO TEACH YOU ABOUT TIME AND SPACE IN THE FUTURE AND I SAID GREAT AND HE SAID ONE DAY WHAT 'S THE SHORTEST DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS AND I SAID WELL THAT 'S A STRAIGHT LINE YOU TOLD ME THAT YESTERDAY I THOUGHT I WAS VERY CLEVER
AmberCase_2010W HE SAID NO NO NO HERE 'S A BETTER WAY HE TOOK A PIECE OF PAPER DREW A AND B ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER AND FOLDED THEM TOGETHER SO WHERE A AND B TOUCHED AND HE SAID THAT IS THE SHORTEST DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS AND I SAID DAD DAD DAD HOW DO YOU DO THAT HE SAID WELL YOU JUST BEND TIME AND SPACE IT TAKES AN AWFUL LOT OF ENERGY AND THAT 'S JUST HOW YOU DO IT
AmberCase_2010W THEY WEREN 'T PHYSICALLY TRANSPORTING THEMSELVES THEY WERE MENTALLY TRANSPORTING THEMSELVES THEY WOULD CLICK ON A BUTTON AND THEY WOULD BE CONNECTED AS A TO B IMMEDIATELY
AmberCase_2010W AND I THOUGHT OH WOW I FOUND IT THIS IS GREAT
AmberCase_2010W SO OVER TIME TIME AND SPACE HAVE COMPRESSED BECAUSE OF THIS YOU CAN STAND ON ONE SIDE OF THE WORLD WHISPER SOMETHING AND BE HEARD ON THE OTHER
AmberCase_2010W ONE OF THE OTHER IDEAS THAT COMES AROUND IS THAT YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF TIME ON EVERY SINGLE DEVICE THAT YOU USE EVERY SINGLE BROWSER TAB GIVES YOU A DIFFERENT TYPE OF TIME AND BECAUSE OF THAT YOU START TO DIG AROUND FOR YOUR EXTERNAL MEMORIES WHERE DID YOU LEAVE THEM SO NOW WE 'RE ALL THESE PALEONTOLOGISTS THAT ARE DIGGING FOR THINGS THAT WE 'VE LOST ON OUR EXTERNAL BRAINS THAT WE 'RE CARRYING AROUND IN OUR POCKETS
AmberCase_2010W AND THAT INCITES A SORT OF PANIC ARCHITECTURE OH NO WHERE 'S THIS THING WE 'RE ALL I LOVE LUCY ON A GREAT ASSEMBLY LINE OF INFORMATION AND WE CAN 'T KEEP UP
AmberCase_2010W AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN WE BRING ALL THAT INTO THE SOCIAL SPACE WE END UP CHECKING OUR PHONES ALL THE TIME
AmberCase_2010W SO WE HAVE THIS THING CALLED AMBIENT INTIMACY IT 'S NOT THAT WE 'RE ALWAYS CONNECTED TO EVERYBODY BUT AT ANYTIME WE CAN CONNECT TO ANYONE WE WANT
AmberCase_2010W AND IF YOU WERE ABLE TO PRINT OUT EVERYBODY IN YOUR CELL PHONE THE ROOM WOULD BE VERY CROWDED THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO RIGHT NOW IN GENERAL ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY THAT YOU CAN CONNECT TO AND SO THERE ARE SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS THAT HAPPEN WITH THIS
AmberCase_2010W THEY 'RE NOT JUST SITTING THERE AND REALLY WHEN YOU HAVE NO EXTERNAL INPUT
AmberCase_2010W THAT IS A TIME WHEN THERE IS A CREATION OF SELF WHEN YOU CAN DO LONG TERM PLANNING WHEN YOU CAN TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHO YOU REALLY ARE AND THEN ONCE YOU DO THAT YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO PRESENT YOUR SECOND SELF IN A LEGITIMATE WAY
AmberCase_2010W INSTEAD OF JUST DEALING WITH EVERYTHING AS IT COMES IN AND OH I HAVE TO DO THIS AND I HAVE TO DO THIS AND I HAVE TO DO THIS AND SO THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT I 'M REALLY WORRIED THAT ESPECIALLY KIDS TODAY THEY 'RE NOT GOING TO BE
AmberCase_2010W DEALING WITH THIS DOWN TIME THAT THEY HAVE AN INSTANTANEOUS BUTTON CLICKING CULTURE AND THAT EVERYTHING COMES TO THEM AND THAT THEY BECOME VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT AND VERY ADDICTED TO IT SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE WORLD HASN 'T STOPPED EITHER IT HAS ITS OWN EXTERNAL PROSTHETIC DEVICES AND THESE DEVICES ARE HELPING US ALL TO COMMUNICATE AND INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER
AmberCase_2010W BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY VISUALIZE IT ALL THE CONNECTIONS THAT WE 'RE DOING
AmberCase_2010W IT DOESN 'T LOOK TECHNOLOGICAL IT ACTUALLY LOOKS VERY ORGANIC THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF HUMANITY THAT WE 'VE CONNECTED IN THIS WAY
AmberCase_2010W AND SO THIS IS THE IMPORTANT POINT THAT I LIKE TO STUDY THAT THINGS ARE BEAUTIFUL THAT IT 'S STILL A HUMAN CONNECTION IT 'S JUST DONE IN A DIFFERENT WAY WE 'RE JUST INCREASING OUR HUMANNESS AND OUR ABILITY TO CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER REGARDLESS OF GEOGRAPHY
