PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 YOU
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 MAY THINK YOU 'RE LOOKING THROUGH A WINDOW AT A DOLPHIN SPINNING PLAYFULLY BUT WHAT YOU 'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING THROUGH IS A TWO WAY MIRROR AT A DOLPHIN LOOKING AT ITSELF SPINNING PLAYFULLY THIS IS A DOLPHIN THAT IS SELF AWARE THIS DOLPHIN HAS SELF AWARENESS IT 'S A YOUNG DOLPHIN NAMED BAYLEY
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 I 'VE BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF THE INTELLIGENCE OF DOLPHINS FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS HOW DO WE EXPLORE INTELLIGENCE IN THIS ANIMAL THAT 'S SO DIFFERENT FROM US AND WHAT I 'VE USED IS A VERY SIMPLE RESEARCH TOOL A MIRROR AND WE 'VE GAINED GREAT INFORMATION REFLECTIONS OF THESE ANIMAL MINDS
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 THEN WE SHOWED IT IN DOLPHINS AND THEN LATER IN ELEPHANTS WE DID THIS WORK IN MY LAB WITH THE DOLPHINS AND ELEPHANTS AND IT 'S BEEN RECENTLY SHOWN IN THE MAGPIE NOW IT 'S INTERESTING BECAUSE
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 WE 'VE EMBRACED THIS DARWINIAN VIEW OF A CONTINUITY IN PHYSICAL EVOLUTION THIS PHYSICAL CONTINUITY
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 BUT WE 'VE BEEN MUCH MORE RETICENT MUCH SLOWER AT RECOGNIZING THIS CONTINUITY IN COGNITION IN EMOTION IN CONSCIOUSNESS IN OTHER ANIMALS OTHER ANIMALS ARE CONSCIOUS THEY 'RE EMOTIONAL
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 THEY 'RE AWARE THERE HAVE BEEN MULTITUDES OF STUDIES WITH MANY SPECIES OVER THE YEARS THAT HAVE GIVEN US EXQUISITE EVIDENCE FOR THINKING AND CONSCIOUSNESS IN OTHER ANIMALS OTHER ANIMALS THAT ARE QUITE DIFFERENT THAN WE ARE IN FORM
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 WE ARE NOT ALONE
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 WE ARE NOT ALONE IN THESE ABILITIES
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 NOW I WANT TO RETURN TO DOLPHINS BECAUSE THESE ARE THE ANIMALS THAT I FEEL LIKE I 'VE BEEN WORKING UP CLOSELY AND PERSONAL WITH FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AND THESE ARE REAL PERSONALITIES THEY ARE NOT PERSONS BUT THEY 'RE PERSONALITIES IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD AND YOU CAN 'T GET MORE ALIEN THAN THE DOLPHIN
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM US IN BODY FORM THEY 'RE RADICALLY DIFFERENT THEY COME FROM A RADICALLY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT IN FACT WE 'RE SEPARATED BY NINETY FIVE MILLION YEARS OF DIVERGENT EVOLUTION
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 I WONDERED HOW WE MIGHT INTERFACE WITH THESE ANIMALS IN THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY S I DEVELOPED AN UNDERWATER KEYBOARD THIS WAS A CUSTOM MADE TOUCH SCREEN KEYBOARD WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS GIVE THE DOLPHINS CHOICE AND CONTROL THESE ARE BIG BRAINS HIGHLY SOCIAL ANIMALS
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 AND I THOUGHT WELL IF WE GIVE THEM CHOICE AND CONTROL IF THEY CAN HIT A SYMBOL ON THIS KEYBOARD AND BY THE WAY IT WAS INTERFACED BY FIBER OPTIC CABLES FROM HEWLETT PACKARD
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 THIS IS DELPHI AND PAN AND YOU 'RE GOING TO SEE DELPHI HITTING A KEY HE HEARS A COMPUTER GENERATED WHISTLE
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 ON THEIR OWN THERE WAS NO INTERVENTION ON OUR PART THEY EXPLORED THE KEYBOARD THEY PLAYED AROUND WITH IT THEY FIGURED OUT HOW IT
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 WHAT WE SAW WAS SELF ORGANIZED LEARNING AND NOW I 'M IMAGINING WHAT CAN WE DO WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES HOW CAN WE CREATE INTERFACES NEW WINDOWS INTO THE MINDS OF ANIMALS WITH THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT EXIST TODAY
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 SO I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS AND THEN ONE DAY I GOT A CALL
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 I 'M A FARM BOY I GREW UP SURROUNDED BY ANIMALS AND I WOULD LOOK IN THESE EYES AND WONDER WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 SO AS AN ADULT WHEN I STARTED TO READ ABOUT THE AMAZING BREAKTHROUGHS WITH PENNY PATTERSON AND KOKO WITH SUE SAVAGE RUMBAUGH AND KANZI PANBANISHA IRENE PEPPERBERG ALEX THE PARROT I GOT ALL EXCITED
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 WHAT WAS AMAZING TO ME ALSO WAS
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 THEY SEEMED A LOT MORE ADEPT AT GETTING A HANDLE ON OUR LANGUAGE THAN WE WERE
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 ON GETTING A HANDLE ON
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 I WORK WITH A LOT OF MUSICIANS FROM AROUND THE WORLD AND OFTEN WE DON 'T HAVE ANY COMMON LANGUAGE AT ALL BUT WE SIT DOWN BEHIND OUR INSTRUMENTS AND SUDDENLY THERE 'S A WAY FOR US TO CONNECT AND EMOTE
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 SO I STARTED COLD CALLING AND EVENTUALLY GOT THROUGH TO SUE SAVAGE RUMBAUGH AND SHE INVITED ME DOWN I WENT DOWN AND
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 THE BONOBOS
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 HAD HAD ACCESS TO PERCUSSION INSTRUMENTS MUSICAL TOYS BUT NEVER BEFORE TO A KEYBOARD AT FIRST THEY DID WHAT INFANTS DO JUST BASHED IT WITH THEIR FISTS AND THEN
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 I ASKED THROUGH SUE IF PANBANISHA COULD TRY WITH ONE FINGER ONLY
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 YOU
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 THAT NIGHT WE BEGAN TO DREAM AND WE THOUGHT PERHAPS THE MOST AMAZING TOOL THAT MAN 'S CREATED IS THE INTERNET AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE COULD SOMEHOW FIND NEW INTERFACES VISUAL AUDIO INTERFACES THAT WOULD ALLOW
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 THESE REMARKABLE SENTIENT BEINGS THAT WE SHARE THE PLANET WITH
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 CALLED HER FRIEND STEVE WOODRUFF AND WE BEGAN HUSTLING ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE WHOSE WORK RELATED OR WAS INSPIRING WHICH LED US TO DIANA
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 AND LED US TO NEIL
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 HE APPROACHED ME WITH A VISION OF DOING THESE THINGS NOT FOR PEOPLE FOR ANIMALS AND THEN I WAS STRUCK IN THE HISTORY OF THE INTERNET THIS IS WHAT
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 THE INTERNET LOOKED LIKE WHEN IT WAS BORN AND YOU CAN CALL THAT THE INTERNET OF MIDDLE AGED WHITE MEN MOSTLY MIDDLE AGED
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 AND THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING A WEB SERVER FOR A DOLLAR GREW INTO WHAT BECAME KNOWN AS THE INTERNET OF THINGS WHICH IS LITERALLY AN INDUSTRY NOW WITH TREMENDOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH CARE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND WE WERE HAPPY WITH OURSELVES AND THEN WHEN PETER SHOWED ME THAT I REALIZED WE HAD MISSED SOMETHING WHICH IS THE REST OF THE PLANET
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 SO WE STARTED UP THIS INTERSPECIES INTERNET PROJECT NOW WE STARTED TALKING WITH TED ABOUT HOW YOU BRING DOLPHINS AND GREAT APES AND ELEPHANTS TO TED AND WE REALIZED THAT WOULDN 'T WORK
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 THAT 'S GREAT WHEN WE WERE REHEARSING LAST NIGHT HE HAD FUN WATCHING THE ELEPHANTS NEXT USER GROUP ARE THE DOLPHINS AT THE NATIONAL AQUARIUM PLEASE GO AHEAD
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 OKAY THAT 'S GREAT THANK YOU AND THE THIRD USER GROUP IN THAILAND IS THINK ELEPHANTS GO AHEAD JOSH
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 FORTY YEARS AGO BOB KAHN AND I DID THE DESIGN OF THE INTERNET THIRTY YEARS AGO WE TURNED IT ON
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 JUST LAST YEAR WE TURNED ON THE PRODUCTION INTERNET YOU 'VE BEEN USING THE EXPERIMENTAL VERSION FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS THE PRODUCTION VERSION
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 IT USES IP VERSION SIX IT HAS THREE POINT FOUR TIMES TEN TO THE THIRTY EIGHTH POSSIBLE TERMINATIONS THAT 'S A NUMBER ONLY THAT CONGRESS CAN APPRECIATE
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 BUT IT LEADS TO WHAT IS COMING NEXT
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 WHEN BOB AND I DID THIS DESIGN
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 WE THOUGHT WE WERE BUILDING A SYSTEM TO CONNECT COMPUTERS TOGETHER WHAT WE VERY QUICKLY DISCOVERED IS THAT THIS WAS A SYSTEM FOR CONNECTING PEOPLE TOGETHER
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 AND WHAT YOU 'VE SEEN TONIGHT
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 TELLS YOU THAT WE SHOULD NOT RESTRICT THIS NETWORK TO ONE SPECIES
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 THAT THESE OTHER INTELLIGENT SENTIENT SPECIES SHOULD BE PART OF THE SYSTEM TOO THIS IS THE SYSTEM AS IT LOOKS TODAY BY THE WAY THIS IS WHAT THE INTERNET LOOKS LIKE TO A COMPUTER THAT 'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE TRAFFIC IS SUPPOSED TO GO
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 THIS IS GENERATED BY A PROGRAM THAT 'S LOOKING AT THE CONNECTIVITY OF THE INTERNET AND HOW ALL THE VARIOUS NETWORKS ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER THERE ARE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND NETWORKS
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 INTERCONNECTED RUN INDEPENDENTLY BY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DIFFERENT OPERATING AGENCIES AND THE ONLY REASON THIS WORKS IS THAT THEY ALL USE THE SAME STANDARD TCP IP PROTOCOLS WELL YOU KNOW WHERE THIS IS HEADED THE INTERNET OF THINGS TELL US THAT A LOT OF
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 COMPUTER ENABLED APPLIANCES AND DEVICES ARE GOING TO BECOME PART OF THIS SYSTEM TOO
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 APPLIANCES THAT YOU USE AROUND THE HOUSE THAT YOU USE IN YOUR OFFICE THAT YOU CARRY AROUND WITH YOURSELF OR IN THE CAR THAT 'S THE INTERNET OF THINGS THAT 'S COMING NOW WHAT 'S IMPORTANT ABOUT WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE DOING
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 IS THAT THEY 'RE BEGINNING TO LEARN HOW TO COMMUNICATE
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 WITH SPECIES THAT ARE NOT US
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 BUT SHARE A COMMON SENSORY ENVIRONMENT WE 'RE BEGINNING TO EXPLORE WHAT IT MEANS TO COMMUNICATE WITH SOMETHING THAT ISN 'T JUST ANOTHER PERSON WELL YOU CAN SEE WHAT 'S COMING NEXT
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 ALL KINDS OF POSSIBLE SENTIENT BEINGS MAY BE INTERCONNECTED THROUGH THIS SYSTEM AND I CAN 'T WAIT TO SEE THESE EXPERIMENTS UNFOLD
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 WELL LET 'S SEE THERE ARE MACHINES THAT NEED TO TALK TO MACHINES AND THAT WE NEED TO TALK TO AND SO AS TIME GOES ON WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH COMPUTERS AND HOW TO GET COMPUTERS TO COMMUNICATE WITH US IN THE WAY THAT WE 'RE ACCUSTOMED TO NOT WITH KEYBOARDS NOT WITH MICE
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 TO BECOME A TRANSLATOR BETWEEN OURSELVES AND SOME OF THE OTHER MACHINES WE LIVE WITH
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 NOW THERE IS A PROJECT THAT 'S UNDERWAY CALLED THE INTERPLANETARY INTERNET IT 'S IN OPERATION BETWEEN EARTH AND MARS
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 WHICH THE DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY WHICH FUNDED THE ORIGINAL ARPANET FUNDED THE INTERNET FUNDED THE INTERPLANETARY ARCHITECTURE IS NOW FUNDING A PROJECT TO DESIGN A SPACECRAFT TO GET TO THE NEAREST STAR IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS TIME
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WHAT WE 'RE LEARNING
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 HOW WE MIGHT INTERACT WITH AN ALIEN FROM ANOTHER WORLD I CAN HARDLY WAIT
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 THAT ARE WONDERFUL INDIVIDUALLY TO LINK THEM GLOBALLY
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013 JUST TO CLARIFY SOME PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE LOOKED AT THE VIDEO THAT YOU SHOWED AND THOUGHT WELL THAT 'S JUST A WEBCAM WHAT 'S SPECIAL ABOUT IT IF YOU COULD TALK FOR JUST A MOMENT ABOUT HOW YOU WANT TO GO PAST THAT
