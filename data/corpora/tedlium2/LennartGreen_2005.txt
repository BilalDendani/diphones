LennartGreen_2005 MY FAVORITE TOPIC IS
LennartGreen_2005 THE MASTER OF SHORTCUTS IT'S OF COURSE NATURE BUT I WILL DEMONSTRATE
LennartGreen_2005 WAYS TO GET
LennartGreen_2005 TO GET RID OF DIFFICULTIES AND GO TO THE POINT TO FIND AN ANSWER PROBABLY MUCH QUICKER THAN ARTHUR DID SO
LennartGreen_2005 VIOLATE THE COMMON SENSE
LennartGreen_2005 UP IF YOU DO THIS
LennartGreen_2005 THE COMMON THE LOGIC SAYS YOU MUST TURN THE
LennartGreen_2005 I WILL FIRST
LennartGreen_2005 HOW YOU CAN DO IT WITHOUT MOVING THE WRIST
LennartGreen_2005 RIGHT MOLDED
LennartGreen_2005 AND I
LennartGreen_2005 OVER THE HEART DON'T MOVE THE WRIST
LennartGreen_2005 FORWARD DON'T MOVE THE WRIST
LennartGreen_2005 DON'T MOVE THE WRIST OVER THE HEART
LennartGreen_2005 TO THIS POSITION FROM THIS WITHOUT MOVING THE WRIST
LennartGreen_2005 NOW THE SHORTCUT
LennartGreen_2005 BUT IT WAS SIX SIX MOVES NOW WITH ONE
LennartGreen_2005 I START HERE PALM DOWN YOU CAN FOLLOW
LennartGreen_2005 THAT WAS THE WARMING

LennartGreen_2005 CONTROL CARDS AND SO ON AND
LennartGreen_2005 TO DO IT QUICK I WORK WITH
LennartGreen_2005 SO
LennartGreen_2005 I HAVE STUDIED THE POKER I LIKE

LennartGreen_2005 IF WE HAVE A FIVE PERSON AND I WILL DO A FIVE HANDED POKER GAME
LennartGreen_2005 NOW I WILL INTERACT SO A DIFFERENT
LennartGreen_2005 THE TIME SO NOT THE SAME PERSON CAN ANSWER SO WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT
LennartGreen_2005 WHICH ONE SHALL HAVE A GOOD
LennartGreen_2005 WHICH NUMBER ONE TWO THREE FOUR OR FIVE
LennartGreen_2005 TO MAKE IT A LITTLE THE CRITICAL MOMENT IS
LennartGreen_2005 IF A CARD SHARK GATHER THE CARD TOGETHER IMMEDIATELY WHEN HE
LennartGreen_2005 HE DEALS THE CARD NOW
LennartGreen_2005 SO I THINK NUMBER THREE I HAVE ARRANGED THEM IN A FULL HOUSE WITH QUEENS

LennartGreen_2005 NOW ANOTHER TERM CALLED SHUFFLE TRACKING SHUFFLE TRACKING MEANS I KEEP TRACK OF THE
LennartGreen_2005 EVEN IF ANOTHER PERSON PERSON SHUFFLE THIS IS A LITTLE RISKY SO BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK NOW I CAN STILL SEE IT YOU AGREE
LennartGreen_2005 HAVE TO CALCULATE BUT ACTUALLY I DON'T LIKE TO CALCULATE I WORK DIRECT WITH THE RIGHT BRAIN IF YOU PASS THE LEFT BRAIN YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF LOGIC AND COMMON SENSE DIRECT IN THE RIGHT BRAIN THAT'S MUCH BETTER
LennartGreen_2005 OF THE SAME
LennartGreen_2005 AND IF YOU WORK WITH IN THE RIGHT ATMOSPHERE WITH HUMOR YOU HAVE THAT'S THE PASSWORD TO THE
LennartGreen_2005 COSMIC BANK OF KNOWLEDGE
