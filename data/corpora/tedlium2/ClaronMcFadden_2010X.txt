ClaronMcFadden_2010X@184.64:197.8 THE HUMAN VOICE MYSTERIOUS SPONTANEOUS PRIMAL FOR ME THE HUMAN VOICE IS THE VESSEL ON WHICH ALL EMOTIONS TRAVEL
ClaronMcFadden_2010X@197.81:200.9 EXCEPT PERHAPS JEALOUSY
ClaronMcFadden_2010X@200.9:205.36 AND THE BREATH THE BREATH IS THE CAPTAIN OF THAT VESSEL
ClaronMcFadden_2010X@205.36:212.66 A CHILD IS BORN TAKES ITS FIRST BREATH
ClaronMcFadden_2010X@220.51:233.95 AND WE BEHOLD THE WONDROUS BEAUTY OF VOCAL EXPRESSION MYSTERIOUS SPONTANEOUS AND PRIMAL
ClaronMcFadden_2010X@233.95:251.65 A FEW YEARS AGO I DID A MEDITATION RETREAT IN THAILAND I WANTED A PLACE THAT I WOULD HAVE TOTAL SILENCE AND TOTAL SOLITUDE I SPENT TWO WEEKS AT THIS RETREAT IN MY OWN LITTLE HUT NO MUSIC NO NOTHING SOUNDS OF NATURE
ClaronMcFadden_2010X@251.65:266.82 TRYING TO FIND THE ESSENCE OF CONCENTRATION BEING IN THE MOMENT ON MY LAST DAY THE WOMAN WHO LOOKED AFTER THE PLACE SHE CAME AND WE SPOKE FOR A MINUTE AND THEN SHE SAID TO ME
ClaronMcFadden_2010X@266.82:274.45 WOULD YOU SING SOMETHING FOR ME AND I THOUGHT BUT THIS IS A PLACE OF TOTAL QUIET AND SILENCE I CAN 'T MAKE NOISE

ClaronMcFadden_2010X@389.53:397.26 WITHIN THIS STRUCTURE HAS TOTAL FREEDOM TO BE CREATIVE SPONTANEOUS FOR EXAMPLE
