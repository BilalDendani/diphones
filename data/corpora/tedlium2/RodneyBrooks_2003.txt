RodneyBrooks_2003@166.26:172.54 A PRODUCT AND LET ME JUST SHOW YOU THAT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THIS AWAY I THINK CHRIS SAID AFTER THE TALK THIS
RodneyBrooks_2003@183.05:188.63 IT STARTS OFF SORT OF JUST GOING AROUND IN EVER INCREASING CIRCLES IF IT HITS SOMETHING
RodneyBrooks_2003@194.55:196.76 TO CLEAN UP AROUND ME LET 'S SEE LET 'S
RodneyBrooks_2003@199.00:203.01 WHO STOLE MY RICE KRISPIES THEY STOLE MY RICE KRISPIES

RodneyBrooks_2003@248.09:249.32 OK SO
RodneyBrooks_2003@252.80:256.38 LATER
RodneyBrooks_2003@260.18:266.69 THE TRICK WAS BUILDING A BETTER CLEANING MECHANISM ACTUALLY THE INTELLIGENCE ON BOARD WAS FAIRLY SIMPLE
RodneyBrooks_2003@267.77:276.61 AND THAT'S TRUE WITH A LOT OF ROBOTS WE'VE ALL I THINK BECOME SORT OF COMPUTATIONAL CHAUVINISTS AND THINK THAT COMPUTATION IS EVERYTHING BUT THE MECHANICS STILL MATTER
RodneyBrooks_2003@277.85:285.01 ANOTHER ROBOT THE PACKBOT THAT WE'VE BEEN BUILDING FOR A BUNCH OF YEARS IT'S A MILITARY SURVEILLANCE ROBOT TO
RodneyBrooks_2003@285.38:293.17 GO IN AHEAD OF TROOPS LOOKING AT CAVES FOR INSTANCE BUT WE HAD TO MAKE IT FAIRLY ROBUST
RodneyBrooks_2003@293.95:297.98 MUCH MORE ROBUST THAN THE ROBOTS WE BUILD IN OUR LABS
RodneyBrooks_2003@309.49:314.42 THAT ROBOT IS A PC RUNNING LINUX IT CAN WITHSTAND A FOUR HUNDRED
RodneyBrooks_2003@314.54:328.33 G SHOCK THE ROBOT HAS LOCAL INTELLIGENCE IT CAN FLIP ITSELF OVER CAN GET ITSELF INTO COMMUNICATION RANGE CAN GO UPSTAIRS BY ITSELF ET CETERA
RodneyBrooks_2003@336.90:341.10 IT'S DOING LOCAL NAVIGATION THERE A SOLDIER GIVES IT A COMMAND
RodneyBrooks_2003@341.49:351.86 TO GO UPSTAIRS AND IT DOES THAT WAS NOT A CONTROLLED DESCENT NOW
RodneyBrooks_2003@352.32:361.89 HEAD OFF AND THE BIG BREAKTHROUGH FOR THESE ROBOTS REALLY WAS SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH WE HAD THE ROBOTS DOWN AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER LATE THAT EVENING
RodneyBrooks_2003@373.72:379.54 AND SEARCHED FOR POSSIBLE SURVIVORS IN THE BUILDINGS THAT WERE TOO DANGEROUS TO GO INTO LET 'S RUN THIS VIDEO
RodneyBrooks_2003@390.03:390.67 ONE
RodneyBrooks_2003@398.67:399.39 HAD
RodneyBrooks_2003@408.25:410.48 WHAT'S GOING ON THE ROBOT
RodneyBrooks_2003@429.14:431.97 IN AFGHANISTAN EVERY DAY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THEY
RodneyBrooks_2003@434.86:435.07 IN
RodneyBrooks_2003@468.10:469.86 CHRIS STAND UP
RodneyBrooks_2003@471.22:479.83 YEAH OKAY COME OVER HERE NOW NOTICE HE THINKS ROBOTS HAVE TO BE A BIT STIFF HE SORT OF
RodneyBrooks_2003@488.05:501.02 THIS ROBOT A TASK IT'S A VERY COMPLEX TASK NOW NOTICE HE NODDED THERE HE WAS GIVING ME SOME INDICATION HE WAS UNDERSTANDING THE FLOW OF COMMUNICATION AND IF I'D SAID SOMETHING COMPLETELY BIZARRE HE WOULD HAVE LOOKED ASKANCE AT ME AND REGULATED THE CONVERSATION
RodneyBrooks_2003@501.45:515.17 SO NOW I BROUGHT THIS UP IN FRONT OF HIM I'D LOOKED AT HIS EYES AND I SAW HIS EYES LOOKED AT THIS BOTTLE TOP AND I'M DOING THIS TASK HERE AND HE 'S CHECKING UP HIS EYES ARE GOING BACK AND FORTH UP TO ME TO SEE WHAT I'M LOOKING AT SO WE'VE GOT SHARED ATTENTION
RodneyBrooks_2003@515.58:524.68 AND SO I DO THIS TASK AND HE LOOKS AND HE LOOKS TO ME TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING NEXT AND NOW I'LL GIVE HIM THE BOTTLE AND WE'LL SEE IF HE CAN DO THE TASK CAN YOU DO THAT
RodneyBrooks_2003@527.20:536.02 OKAY HE 'S PRETTY GOOD YEAH GOOD GOOD GOOD I DIDN'T SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THAT NOW SEE IF YOU CAN PUT IT BACK TOGETHER
RodneyBrooks_2003@537.29:543.25 AND HE THINKS A ROBOT HAS TO BE REALLY SLOW GOOD ROBOT THAT'S GOOD SO WE SAW A BUNCH OF THINGS THERE
RodneyBrooks_2003@543.54:549.39 WE SAW WHEN WE'RE INTERACTING WE'RE TRYING TO SHOW SOMEONE HOW TO DO SOMETHING WE DIRECT THEIR VISUAL ATTENTION
RodneyBrooks_2003@557.55:566.00 SHARED ATTENTION LOOKING AT THE SAME SORT OF THING AND RECOGNIZING SOCIALLY COMMUNICATED REINFORCEMENT AT THE END AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO PUT THAT INTO OUR LAB
RodneyBrooks_2003@566.42:571.39 BECAUSE WE THINK THIS IS HOW YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO INTERACT WITH ROBOTS IN THE FUTURE I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU ONE
RodneyBrooks_2003@571.92:579.91 DIAGRAM HERE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR BUILDING A ROBOT THAT YOU CAN INTERACT WITH SOCIALLY IS ITS VISUAL ATTENTION SYSTEM BECAUSE WHAT IT PAYS ATTENTION TO
RodneyBrooks_2003@580.95:588.45 IT'S SEEING AND INTERACTING WITH AND WHAT YOU'RE UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT'S DOING SO IN THE VIDEOS I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU YOU'RE GOING TO SEE
RodneyBrooks_2003@599.09:610.61 IT LOOKS FOR HIGHLY SATURATED COLORS FROM TOYS AND IT LOOKS FOR THINGS THAT MOVE AROUND AND IT WEIGHTS THOSE TOGETHER INTO AN ATTENTION WINDOW AND IT LOOKS FOR THE HIGHEST SCORING PLACE THE STUFF WHERE THE MOST INTERESTING STUFF IS HAPPENING
RodneyBrooks_2003@619.25:632.17 MIGHT DECIDE THAT IT'S LONELY AND LOOK FOR SKIN TONE OR MIGHT DECIDE THAT IT'S BORED AND LOOK FOR A TOY TO PLAY WITH AND SO THESE WEIGHTS CHANGE AND OVER HERE ON THE RIGHT THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE STEVEN SPIELBERG MEMORIAL MODULE
RodneyBrooks_2003@647.05:654.02 THIS IS A HABITUATION GAUSSIAN THAT GETS NEGATIVE AND MORE AND MORE INTENSE AS IT LOOKS AT ONE THING AND IT GETS BORED
RodneyBrooks_2003@662.83:674.17 YOU CAN TELL WHAT IT'S LOOKING AT YOU CAN ESTIMATE ITS GAZE DIRECTION FROM THOSE EYEBALLS COVERING ITS CAMERA AND YOU CAN TELL WHEN IT'S ACTUALLY SEEING THE TOY AND IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT OF AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE HERE
RodneyBrooks_2003@690.32:694.00 KISMET HAS AN UNDERLYING THREE DIMENSIONAL EMOTIONAL SPACE
RodneyBrooks_2003@699.15:702.65 SPACE IT EXPRESSES
RodneyBrooks_2003@733.48:737.59 BASIC MESSAGES THAT MOTHERS GIVE THEIR CHILDREN PRE LINGUISTICALLY
RodneyBrooks_2003@750.22:752.34 AND THE ROBOT 'S REACTING APPROPRIATELY
RodneyBrooks_2003@763.94:770.45 SMILES SHE IMITATES THE SMILE THIS HAPPENS A LOT THESE ARE NAIVE SUBJECTS HERE WE ASKED THEM TO GET THE ROBOT 'S ATTENTION
RodneyBrooks_2003@771.44:774.21 AND INDICATE WHEN THEY HAVE THE ROBOT 'S ATTENTION
RodneyBrooks_2003@779.34:779.55 THE
RodneyBrooks_2003@784.24:784.41 THE
RodneyBrooks_2003@790.72:795.92 ASKED TO PROHIBIT THE ROBOT AND THIS FIRST WOMAN REALLY PUSHES THE ROBOT INTO AN EMOTIONAL
RodneyBrooks_2003@815.36:821.23 WE PUT THAT TOGETHER THEN WE PUT IN TURN TAKING WHEN WE TALK TO SOMEONE WE TALK THEN WE SORT OF
RodneyBrooks_2003@821.59:831.47 RAISE OUR EYEBROWS MOVE OUR EYES GIVE THE OTHER PERSON THE IDEA IT'S THEIR TURN TO TALK AND THEN THEY TALK AND THEN WE PASS THE BATON BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN EACH
RodneyBrooks_2003@832.41:843.40 OTHER SO WE PUT THIS IN THE ROBOT WE GOT A BUNCH OF NAIVE SUBJECTS IN WE DIDN'T TELL THEM ANYTHING ABOUT THE ROBOT SAT THEM DOWN IN FRONT OF THE ROBOT AND SAID TALK TO THE ROBOT NOW WHAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WAS THE ROBOT WASN'T UNDERSTANDING A WORD THEY SAID
RodneyBrooks_2003@843.98:854.46 AND THAT THE ROBOT WASN'T SPEAKING ENGLISH IT WAS JUST SAYING RANDOM ENGLISH PHONEMES AND I WANT YOU TO WATCH CAREFULLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS WHERE THIS PERSON RITCHIE WHO HAPPENED TO TALK TO THE ROBOT FOR TWENTY FIVE MINUTES
RodneyBrooks_2003@856.58:864.96 SAYS I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING I WANT TO SHOW YOU MY WATCH AND HE BRINGS THE WATCH CENTER IN TO THE ROBOT 'S FIELD OF VISION
RodneyBrooks_2003@874.29:875.42 NOTICE THE TURN TAKING
RodneyBrooks_2003@878.43:878.66 A
RodneyBrooks_2003@907.83:915.85 AND THEN WHEN CHRISTIE LOOKS OVER AT THIS TOY THE ROBOT ESTIMATES HER GAZE DIRECTION AND LOOKS AT THE SAME THING THAT SHE'S LOOKING AT
RodneyBrooks_2003@929.24:937.00 WILL WE ACCEPT THEM WILL WE WILL THEY NEED RIGHTS EVENTUALLY AND THE OTHER QUESTION PEOPLE ASK ME IS WILL THEY WANT TO TAKE OVER
RodneyBrooks_2003@937.86:950.21 AND ON THE FIRST YOU KNOW THIS HAS BEEN A VERY HOLLYWOOD THEME WITH LOTS OF MOVIES YOU PROBABLY RECOGNIZE THESE CHARACTERS HERE WHERE IN EACH OF THESE CASES THE ROBOTS WANT MORE RESPECT WELL DO YOU EVER NEED TO GIVE ROBOTS RESPECT
RodneyBrooks_2003@951.61:963.54 JUST MACHINES AFTER ALL BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT WE ARE JUST MACHINES AFTER ALL THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT MODERN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY SAYS ABOUT US YOU DON'T SEE A DESCRIPTION OF
RodneyBrooks_2003@964.27:976.11 HOW YOU KNOW MOLECULE A YOU KNOW COMES UP AND DOCKS WITH THIS OTHER MOLECULE AND IT'S MOVING FORWARD YOU KNOW PROPELLED BY VARIOUS CHARGES AND THEN THE SOUL STEPS IN AND TWEAKS THOSE MOLECULES SO THAT THEY CONNECT
RodneyBrooks_2003@976.48:984.55 IT'S ALL MECHANISTIC WE ARE MECHANISM IF WE ARE MACHINES THEN IN PRINCIPLE AT LEAST WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD MACHINES
RodneyBrooks_2003@984.92:988.22 OUT OF OTHER STUFF WHICH ARE JUST AS
RodneyBrooks_2003@989.93:996.22 ALIVE AS WE ARE BUT I THINK FOR US TO ADMIT THAT WE HAVE TO GIVE UP ON OUR SPECIAL NESS IN A CERTAIN WAY AND WE'VE HAD THE
RodneyBrooks_2003@1007.41:1016.13 WHEN THE EARTH STARTED TO GO AROUND THE SUN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO WITH DARWIN WE HAD TO GIVE UP THE IDEA WE WERE DIFFERENT FROM ANIMALS AND TO YOU KNOW IMAGINE
RodneyBrooks_2003@1035.52:1044.16 REALLY HAVE EMOTIONS OR THAT ROBOTS COULD BE LIVING CREATURES I THINK IS GOING TO BE HARD FOR US TO ACCEPT BUT WE'RE GOING TO COME TO ACCEPT IT OVER THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS OR SO
RodneyBrooks_2003@1044.59:1057.05 THE SECOND QUESTION IS WILL THE MACHINES WANT TO TAKE OVER AND HERE THE STANDARD SCENARIO IS THAT WE CREATE THESE THINGS THEY GROW WE NURTURE THEM THEY LEARN A LOT FROM US AND THEN THEY START TO DECIDE THAT WE'RE PRETTY
RodneyBrooks_2003@1057.92:1068.94 BORING SLOW THEY WANT TO TAKE OVER FROM US AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE TEENAGERS YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE BUT HOLLYWOOD EXTENDS IT TO THE ROBOTS AND
RodneyBrooks_2003@1083.24:1085.19 HAPPEN AND I DON'T THINK
RodneyBrooks_2003@1086.92:1094.84 I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO DELIBERATELY BUILD ROBOTS THAT WE'RE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH WE'LL YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A SUPER BAD ROBOT BEFORE THAT HAS TO COME TO BE YOU KNOW
RodneyBrooks_2003@1095.05:1103.24 A MILDLY BAD ROBOT AND BEFORE THAT A NOT SO BAD ROBOT AND WE'RE JUST NOT GOING TO LET IT GO THAT WAY SO
RodneyBrooks_2003@1104.96:1113.65 I THINK I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT AT THAT THE ROBOTS ARE COMING WE DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TO WORRY ABOUT IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF FUN AND I HOPE YOU ALL ENJOY THE JOURNEY
