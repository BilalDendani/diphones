BartKnols_2012X@32.88:36.56 I HATE THEM DON 'T YOU
BartKnols_2012X@36.97:41.71 THAT AWFUL BUZZING SOUND AT NIGHT AROUND YOUR EARS THAT DRIVES YOU ABSOLUTELY CRAZY
BartKnols_2012X@42.27:45.89 KNOWING THAT SHE WANTS TO STICK A NEEDLE IN YOUR SKIN AND SUCK OUT YOUR BLOOD
BartKnols_2012X@46.6:49.16 THAT 'S AWFUL RIGHT IN FACT
BartKnols_2012X@49.75:53.28 THERE 'S ONLY ONE GOOD THING I CAN THINK OF WHEN IT GETS TO MOSQUITOS
BartKnols_2012X@56.81:59.5 THEY PREFER TO BITE MY WIFE
BartKnols_2012X@59.85:65.15 BUT THAT 'S FASCINATING RIGHT WHY DOES SHE RECEIVE MORE BITES THAN I DO
BartKnols_2012X@65.72:67.89 AND THE ANSWER IS SMELL
BartKnols_2012X@68.1:69.61 THE SMELL OF HER BODY
BartKnols_2012X@70.17:73.82 AND SINCE WE ALL SMELL DIFFERENT AND PRODUCE CHEMICALS ON OUR SKIN
BartKnols_2012X@80.39:82.76 SO MY WIFE SMELLS NICER THAN I DO
BartKnols_2012X@82.82:86.05 OR I JUST STINK MORE THAN SHE DOES
BartKnols_2012X@108.63:112.06 AND THEREFORE WE SET UP VARIOUS EXPERIMENTS
BartKnols_2012X@112.65:114.71 WHY DID WE SET UP THESE EXPERIMENTS
BartKnols_2012X@114.87:117.16 BECAUSE HALF THE WORLD 'S POPULATION
BartKnols_2012X@117.2:123.32 RUNS THE RISK OF CONTRACTING A KILLER DISEASE LIKE MALARIA THROUGH A SIMPLE MOSQUITO
BartKnols_2012X@123.88:128.58 EVERY THIRTY SECONDS SOMEWHERE ON THIS PLANET A CHILD DIES OF MALARIA
BartKnols_2012X@128.81:135.74 AND PAUL LEVY THIS MORNING HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE METAPHOR OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN CRASHING INTO THE UNITED STATES WELL IN AFRICA
BartKnols_2012X@156.57:168.19 BUT WE UNDERTOOK SOME REMARKABLE EXPERIMENTS THAT MANAGED US TO RESOLVE THIS PUZZLE VERY QUICKLY INDEED FIRST WE OBSERVED THAT NOT ALL MOSQUITO SPECIES BITE ON THE SAME PART OF THE BODY
BartKnols_2012X@173.65:175.21 IN A LARGE CAGE
BartKnols_2012X@175.83:178.31 AND IN THAT CAGE WE RELEASED MOSQUITOS
BartKnols_2012X@178.37:181.3 TO SEE WHERE THEY WERE BITING ON THE BODY OF THAT PERSON
BartKnols_2012X@181.63:186.92 AND WE FOUND SOME REMARKABLE DIFFERENCES ON THE LEFT HERE YOU SEE THE BITES
BartKnols_2012X@192.65:198.25 IN CONTRAST THE AFRICAN MALARIAL MOSQUITO HAD A VERY STRONG PREFERENCE FOR BITING THE ANKLES
BartKnols_2012X@198.39:207.11 AND FEET OF THIS PERSON AND THAT OF COURSE WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ALL ALONG BECAUSE THEY 'RE CALLED MOSQUI TOES YOU SEE
BartKnols_2012X@216.26:221.53 ON THE SMELL OF HUMAN FEET UNTIL WE CAME ACROSS A REMARKABLE STATEMENT IN THE LITERATURE
BartKnols_2012X@221.87:227.49 THAT SAID THAT CHEESE SMELLS AFTER FEET RATHER THAN THE REVERSE
BartKnols_2012X@235.14:236.71 OF LIMBURGER CHEESE
BartKnols_2012X@236.86:242.47 WHICH SMELLS BADLY AFTER FEET TO ATTRACT AFRICAN MALARIA MOSQUITOS AND YOU KNOW WHAT
BartKnols_2012X@245.49:247.14 IT WORKED IN FACT IT WORKED SO WELL
BartKnols_2012X@247.43:258.15 THAT NOW WE HAVE A SYNTHETIC MIXTURE OF THE AROMA OF LIMBURGER CHEESE THAT WE 'RE USING IN TANZANIA AND HAS BEEN SHOWN THERE TO BE TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE ATTRACTIVE TO MOSQUITOS
BartKnols_2012X@263.34:266.53 AS IT IS NOW USED IN THE FIGHT AGAINST MALARIA
BartKnols_2012X@287.89:290.69 ONE OF THE BEST WAYS OF KILLING MOSQUITOS
BartKnols_2012X@290.79:296.46 IS NOT TO WAIT UNTIL THEY FLY AROUND LIKE ADULTS AND BITE PEOPLE AND TRANSMIT DISEASE
BartKnols_2012X@296.81:299.22 IT 'S TO KILL THEM WHEN THEY 'RE STILL IN THE WATER
BartKnols_2012X@315.68:321.37 AND THEY 'RE ACCESSIBLE YOU CAN ACTUALLY WALK UP TO THAT POOL AND YOU CAN KILL THEM THERE
BartKnols_2012X@340.05:342.42 AND LAST YEAR WE THOUGHT VERY VERY HARD
BartKnols_2012X@342.59:344.6 HOW CAN WE RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM
BartKnols_2012X@344.94:347.75 UNTIL WE REALIZED THAT JUST LIKE US
BartKnols_2012X@353.45:357.96 AND SO WE SET UP ANOTHER CRAZY EXPERIMENT BECAUSE WE COLLECTED THE SMELL OF THESE LARVAE
BartKnols_2012X@361.97:373.75 HERE WE HAVE A BAR WITH FOUR HOLES AND WE PUT THE SMELL OF THESE LARVAE IN THE LEFT HOLE OOH THAT WAS VERY QUICK AND THEN YOU SEE THE DOG IT 'S CALLED TWEED IT 'S A BORDER COLLIE HE 'S EXAMINING THESE HOLES AND NOW HE 'S GOT IT ALREADY
BartKnols_2012X@373.76:380.18 HE 'S GOING BACK TO CHECK THE CONTROL HOLES AGAIN BUT HE 'S COMING BACK TO THE FIRST ONE AND NOW HE 'S LOCKING INTO THAT SMELL
BartKnols_2012X@380.28:382.65 WHICH MEANS THAT NOW WE CAN USE DOGS
BartKnols_2012X@382.93:390.13 WITH THESE INSPECTORS TO MUCH BETTER FIND THE BREEDING SITES OF MOSQUITOS IN THE FIELD AND THEREFORE HAVE A MUCH BIGGER IMPACT ON MALARIA
BartKnols_2012X@397.12:408.33 SINCE WE ALSO KNOW THAT PEOPLE THAT CARRY MALARIA PARASITES SMELL DIFFERENT COMPARED TO PEOPLE THAT ARE UNINFECTED SHE 'S CONVINCED THAT WE CAN TRAIN DOGS TO FIND PEOPLE THAT CARRY THE PARASITE
BartKnols_2012X@408.75:420.23 THAT MEANS THAT IN A POPULATION WHERE MALARIA HAS GONE DOWN ALL THE WAY AND THERE 'S FEW PEOPLE REMAINING WITH PARASITES THAT THE DOGS CAN FIND THESE PEOPLE WE CAN TREAT THEM WITH ANTI MALARIAL DRUGS AND GIVE THE FINAL BLOW
BartKnols_2012X@425.08:427.7 MY THIRD STORY IS PERHAPS EVEN MORE REMARKABLE
BartKnols_2012X@428.54:432.2 AND I SHOULD SAY HAS NEVER BEEN SHOWN TO THE PUBLIC UNTIL TODAY
BartKnols_2012X@438.86:441.22 AND ULTIMATE REVENGE AGAINST MOSQUITOS EVER
BartKnols_2012X@441.44:447.31 IN FACT PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME THAT NOW THEY WILL ENJOY BEING BITTEN BY MOSQUITOS
BartKnols_2012X@447.6:452.75 AND THE QUESTION OF COURSE IS WHAT WOULD MAKE SOMEONE ENJOY BEING BITTEN BY MOSQUITOS
BartKnols_2012X@452.87:455.47 AND THE ANSWER I HAVE RIGHT HERE
BartKnols_2012X@467.57:469.23 IT DOES MIRACLES
BartKnols_2012X@480.45:482.58 LET ME SHOW YOU HOW THIS WORKS
BartKnols_2012X@483.12:485.87 HERE IN THIS BOX I HAVE A CAGE
BartKnols_2012X@505.46:507.13 AND I WILL SHOW YOU HOW QUICKLY
BartKnols_2012X@544.62:546.63 AND THREE HOURS LATER
BartKnols_2012X@547.08:549.06 WHAT WE SEE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CAGE
BartKnols_2012X@549.06:554.26 IS DEAD MOSQUITOS VERY DEAD MOSQUITOS
BartKnols_2012X@580.33:585.93 WE CAN ACTUALLY USE THIS TO CONTAIN OUTBREAKS OF MOSQUITO BORN DISEASES OF EPIDEMICS RIGHT
BartKnols_2012X@586.23:592.93 AND BETTER STILL IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF IN A VERY LARGE AREA EVERYONE WOULD TAKE THESE DRUGS THIS DRUG FOR JUST THREE WEEKS
BartKnols_2012X@592.99:597.19 THAT WOULD GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY ELIMINATE MALARIA AS A DISEASE
BartKnols_2012X@597.44:604.67 SO CHEESE DOGS AND A PILL TO KILL MOSQUITOS THAT 'S THE KIND OF OUT OF THE BOX SCIENCE THAT I LOVE DOING
BartKnols_2012X@605.16:606.98 FOR THE BETTERMENT OF MANKIND
