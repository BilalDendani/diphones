MitchellBesser_2010G@16.69:19.44 TO TAKE A TRIP WITH ME PICTURE YOURSELF
MitchellBesser_2010G@19.52:26.49 DRIVING DOWN A SMALL ROAD IN AFRICA AND AS YOU DRIVE ALONG YOU LOOK OFF TO THE SIDE AND THIS IS WHAT YOU SEE
MitchellBesser_2010G@26.49:42.74 YOU SEE A FIELD OF GRAVES AND YOU STOP AND YOU GET OUT OF YOUR CAR AND YOU TAKE A PICTURE AND YOU GO INTO THE TOWN AND YOU INQUIRE WHAT 'S GOING ON HERE AND PEOPLE ARE INITIALLY RELUCTANT TO TELL YOU AND THEN SOMEONE SAYS THESE ARE THE RECENT AIDS DEATHS IN OUR COMMUNITY
MitchellBesser_2010G@42.74:61.01 HIV ISN 'T LIKE OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS IT 'S STIGMATIZING PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT TO TALK ABOUT IT THERE 'S A FEAR ASSOCIATED WITH IT AND I 'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HIV TODAY ABOUT THE DEATHS ABOUT THE STIGMA IT 'S A MEDICAL STORY BUT MORE THAN THAT IT 'S A SOCIAL STORY
MitchellBesser_2010G@63.03:79.84 THIS MAP DEPICTS THE GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION OF HIV AND AS YOU CAN SEE AFRICA HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE INFECTION THERE ARE THIRTY THREE MILLION PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV IN THE WORLD TODAY OF THESE TWO THIRDS TWENTY TWO MILLION ARE LIVING IN SUB SAHARAN AFRICA
MitchellBesser_2010G@79.84:91.24 THERE ARE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION PREGNANT WOMEN IN LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES LIVING WITH HIV AND OF THESE NINETY PERCENT ARE IN SUB SAHARAN AFRICA
MitchellBesser_2010G@91.24:105.55 WE TALK ABOUT THINGS IN RELATIVE TERMS AND I 'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT ANNUAL PREGNANCIES AND HIV POSITIVE MOTHERS THE UNITED STATES A LARGE COUNTRY EACH YEAR SEVEN THOUSAND MOTHERS WITH HIV WHO GIVE BIRTH TO A CHILD
MitchellBesser_2010G@105.55:119.09 BUT YOU GO TO RWANDA A VERY SMALL COUNTRY EIGHT THOUSAND MOTHERS WITH HIV WHO ARE PREGNANT AND THEN YOU GO TO BARAGWANATH HOSPITAL OUTSIDE OF JOHANNESBURG IN SOUTH AFRICA AND
MitchellBesser_2010G@119.09:122.43 EIGHT THOUSAND HIV POSITIVE PREGNANT WOMEN
MitchellBesser_2010G@122.43:140.64 GIVING BIRTH A HOSPITAL THE SAME AS A COUNTRY AND TO REALIZE THAT THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF AN ICEBERG THAT WHEN YOU COMPARE EVERYTHING HERE TO SOUTH AFRICA IT JUST PALES BECAUSE IN SOUTH AFRICA EACH YEAR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MOTHERS WITH HIV GIVE BIRTH TO CHILDREN
MitchellBesser_2010G@143.01:157.45 SO WE TALK ABOUT PMTCT AND WE REFER TO PMTCT PREVENTION OF MOTHER TO CHILD TRANSMISSION I THINK THERE 'S AN ASSUMPTION AMONGST MOST PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC THAT IF A MOTHER IS HIV POSITIVE SHE 'S GOING TO INFECT HER CHILD THE REALITY IS REALLY VERY DIFFERENT
MitchellBesser_2010G@157.45:168.8 IN RESOURCE RICH COUNTRIES WITH ALL THE TESTS AND TREATMENT WE CURRENTLY HAVE LESS THAN TWO PERCENT OF BABIES ARE BORN HIV POSITIVE NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF BABIES ARE BORN HIV NEGATIVE
MitchellBesser_2010G@168.8:180.23 AND YET THE REALITY IN RESOURCE POOR COUNTRIES IN THE ABSENCE OF TESTS AND TREATMENT FORTY PERCENT FORTY PERCENT OF CHILDREN ARE INFECTED FORTY PERCENT VERSUS TWO PERCENT AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE
MitchellBesser_2010G@180.23:184 SO THESE PROGRAMS AND I 'M GOING TO REFER TO PMTCT
MitchellBesser_2010G@198.86:207.31 IT 'S THE DRUGS SHE RECEIVES TO PROTECT THE BABY THAT 'S INSIDE THE UTERUS AND DURING DELIVERY IT 'S THE GUIDANCE SHE GETS AROUND INFANT FEEDING AND SAFER SEX
MitchellBesser_2010G@245.24:248.17 LESS THAN ONE COMES FROM THE UNITED STATES
MitchellBesser_2010G@248.46:263.16 ONE ON AVERAGE COMES FROM EUROPE ONE HUNDRED COME FROM ASIA AND THE PACIFIC AND EACH DAY A THOUSAND BABIES A THOUSAND BABIES ARE BORN EACH DAY WITH HIV IN AFRICA
MitchellBesser_2010G@266.51:283.56 SO AGAIN I LOOK AT THE GLOBE HERE AND THE DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF HIV IN AFRICA AND LET 'S LOOK AT ANOTHER MAP AND HERE AGAIN WE SEE AFRICA HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE NUMBERS OF DOCTORS THAT THIN SLIVER YOU SEE HERE THAT 'S AFRICA AND IT 'S THE SAME WITH NURSES
MitchellBesser_2010G@283.56:290.1 THE TRUTH IS SUB SAHARAN AFRICA HAS TWENTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE GLOBAL DISEASE BURDEN
MitchellBesser_2010G@290.1:293.25 AND YET ONLY THREE PERCENT OF THE WORLD 'S HEALTH CARE WORKERS
MitchellBesser_2010G@293.25:302.77 THAT MEANS DOCTORS AND NURSES SIMPLY DON 'T HAVE THE TIME TO TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS A NURSE IN A BUSY CLINIC WILL SEE FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED PATIENTS IN A DAY
MitchellBesser_2010G@320.39:330.12 THE HIV TEST EXPLAIN THE RESULTS DISPENSE A SINGLE DOSE OF THE DRUG NEVIRAPINE EXPLAIN HOW TO TAKE IT DISCUSS INFANT FEEDING OPTIONS REINFORCE INFANT FEEDING AND TEST THE BABY IN MINUTES
MitchellBesser_2010G@330.12:345.49 WELL FORTUNATELY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE WE 'VE GOT NEW TREATMENTS NEW TESTS AND WE 'RE FAR MORE SUCCESSFUL BUT WE DON 'T HAVE ANY MORE NURSES AND SO THESE ARE THE TESTS A NURSE NOW HAS TO DO IN THOSE SAME FEW MINUTES
MitchellBesser_2010G@345.49:349.09 IT 'S NOT POSSIBLE IT DOESN 'T WORK
MitchellBesser_2010G@349.09:353.9 AND SO WE NEED TO FIND BETTER WAYS OF PROVIDING CARE
MitchellBesser_2010G@356.25:374.23 THIS IS A PICTURE OF A MATERNAL HEALTH CLINIC IN AFRICA MOTHERS COMING PREGNANT AND WITH THEIR BABIES THESE WOMEN ARE HERE FOR CARE BUT WE KNOW THAT JUST DOING A TEST JUST GIVING SOMEONE A DRUG IT 'S NOT ENOUGH MEDS DON 'T EQUAL MEDICAL CARE
MitchellBesser_2010G@374.23:387.26 DOCTORS AND NURSES FRANKLY DON 'T HAVE THE TIME OR SKILLS TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO DO IN WAYS THEY UNDERSTAND I 'M A DOCTOR I TELL PEOPLE THINGS TO DO AND I EXPECT THEM TO FOLLOW MY GUIDANCE BECAUSE I 'M A DOCTOR I WENT TO HARVARD
MitchellBesser_2010G@387.26:396.35 BUT THE REALITY IS IF I TELL A PATIENT YOU SHOULD HAVE SAFER SEX YOU SHOULD ALWAYS USE A CONDOM AND YET IN HER RELATIONSHIP SHE 'S NOT EMPOWERED
MitchellBesser_2010G@396.35:407.04 WHAT 'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF I TELL HER TO TAKE HER MEDICINES EVERY DAY AND YET NO ONE IN THE HOUSEHOLD KNOWS ABOUT HER ILLNESS SO IT 'S JUST NOT GOING TO WORK
MitchellBesser_2010G@407.04:418.98 AND SO WE NEED TO DO MORE WE NEED TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY WE NEED TO DO IT IN WAYS THAT ARE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE AND CAN BE TAKEN TO SCALE WHICH MEANS IT CAN BE DONE EVERYWHERE
MitchellBesser_2010G@418.98:424.09 SO I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY I WANT TO TAKE YOU ON A LITTLE TRIP
MitchellBesser_2010G@424.09:433.31 IMAGINE YOURSELF IF YOU CAN YOU 'RE A YOUNG WOMAN IN AFRICA YOU 'RE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL OR CLINIC YOU GO IN FOR A TEST AND YOU FIND OUT THAT YOU 'RE PREGNANT AND YOU 'RE DELIGHTED
MitchellBesser_2010G@433.31:450.53 AND THEN THEY GIVE YOU ANOTHER TEST AND THEY TELL YOU YOU 'RE HIV POSITIVE AND YOU 'RE DEVASTATED AND THE NURSE TAKES YOU INTO A ROOM AND SHE TELLS YOU ABOUT THE TESTS AND HIV AND THE MEDICINES YOU CAN TAKE AND HOW TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND YOUR BABY AND YOU HEAR NONE OF IT ALL YOU 'RE HEARING IS I 'M GOING TO DIE
MitchellBesser_2010G@450.53:455.32 AND MY BABY IS GOING TO DIE AND THEN YOU 'RE OUT ON THE STREET AND YOU DON 'T KNOW WHERE TO GO AND YOU DON
MitchellBesser_2010G@471.25:478.97 BUT WE 'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS AND SOME GOOD NEWS AND I WANT TO CHANGE THE STORY A LITTLE BIT
MitchellBesser_2010G@478.97:495.84 TAKE THE SAME MOTHER AND THE NURSE AFTER SHE GIVES HER HER TEST TAKES HER TO A ROOM THE DOOR OPENS AND THERE 'S A ROOM FULL OF MOTHERS MOTHERS WITH BABIES AND THEY 'RE SITTING AND THEY 'RE TALKING THEY 'RE LISTENING THEY 'RE DRINKING TEA THEY 'RE HAVING SANDWICHES AND SHE GOES INSIDE AND WOMAN COMES UP TO HER AND SAYS WELCOME TO MOTHERS TWO MOTHERS
MitchellBesser_2010G@495.84:506.81 HAVE A SEAT YOU 'RE SAFE HERE WE 'RE ALL HIV POSITIVE YOU 'RE GOING TO BE OKAY YOU 'RE GOING TO LIVE YOUR BABY IS GOING TO BE HIV NEGATIVE
MitchellBesser_2010G@509.45:513.01 WE VIEW MOTHERS AS A COMMUNITY 'S SINGLE GREATEST RESOURCE
MitchellBesser_2010G@513.01:521.55 MOTHERS TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN TAKE CARE OF THE HOME SO OFTEN THE MEN ARE GONE THEY 'RE WORKING OR THEY 'RE NOT PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD
MitchellBesser_2010G@521.55:533.54 OUR ORGANIZATION MOTHERS TWO MOTHERS ENLISTS WOMEN WITH HIV AS CARE PROVIDERS WE BRING MOTHERS WHO HAVE HIV WHO 'VE BEEN THROUGH THESE PMTCT PROGRAMS IN THE VERY FACILITIES
MitchellBesser_2010G@533.54:538.56 TO COME BACK AND WORK SIDE BY SIDE WITH DOCTORS AND NURSES AS PART OF THE HEALTH CARE TEAM
MitchellBesser_2010G@538.56:558.23 THESE MOTHERS WE CALL THEM MENTOR MOTHERS ARE ABLE TO ENGAGE WOMEN WHO JUST LIKE THEMSELVES PREGNANT WITH BABIES HAVE FOUND OUT ABOUT BEING HIV POSITIVE WHO NEED SUPPORT AND EDUCATION AND THEY SUPPORT THEM AROUND THE DIAGNOSIS AND EDUCATE THEM ABOUT HOW TO TAKE THEIR MEDICINES HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR BABIES
MitchellBesser_2010G@558.23:571.8 CONSIDER IF YOU NEEDED SURGERY YOU WOULD WANT THE BEST POSSIBLE TECHNICAL SURGEON RIGHT BUT IF YOU WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT SURGERY WOULD DO TO YOUR LIFE YOU 'D LIKE TO ENGAGE SOMEONE
MitchellBesser_2010G@571.88:585.08 SOMEONE WHO 'S HAD THE PROCEDURE PATIENTS ARE EXPERTS ON THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE AND THEY CAN SHARE THAT EXPERIENCE WITH OTHERS THIS IS THE MEDICAL CARE THAT GOES BEYOND JUST MEDICINES
MitchellBesser_2010G@585.08:602.84 SO THE MOTHERS WHO WORK FOR US THEY COME FROM THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY WORK THEY 'RE HIRED THEY 'RE PAID AS PROFESSIONAL MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH CARE TEAMS JUST LIKE DOCTORS AND NURSES AND WE OPEN BANK ACCOUNTS FOR THEM AND THEY 'RE PAID DIRECTLY INTO THE ACCOUNTS BECAUSE THEIR MONEY 'S PROTECTED THE MEN CAN 'T TAKE IT AWAY FROM THEM
MitchellBesser_2010G@602.84:607.95 THEY GO THROUGH TWO TO THREE WEEKS OF RIGOROUS CURRICULUM BASED EDUCATION TRAINING
MitchellBesser_2010G@607.95:625.25 NOW DOCTORS AND NURSES THEY TOO GET TRAINED BUT SO OFTEN THEY ONLY GET TRAINED ONCE SO THEY 'RE NOT AWARE OF NEW MEDICINES NEW GUIDELINES AS THEY COME OUT OUR MENTOR MOTHERS GET TRAINED EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND RETRAINED AND SO DOCTORS AND NURSES THEY LOOK UP TO THEM AS EXPERTS
MitchellBesser_2010G@625.25:635.5 IMAGINE THAT A WOMAN A FORMER PATIENT BEING ABLE TO EDUCATE HER DOCTOR FOR THE FIRST TIME AND EDUCATE THE OTHER PATIENTS THAT SHE 'S TAKING CARE OF
MitchellBesser_2010G@635.5:651.56 OUR ORGANIZATION HAS THREE GOALS THE FIRST TO PREVENT MOTHER TO CHILD TRANSMISSION THE SECOND KEEP MOTHERS HEALTHY KEEP MOTHERS ALIVE KEEP THE CHILDREN ALIVE NO MORE ORPHANS AND THE THIRD AND MAYBE THE MOST
MitchellBesser_2010G@660.68:664.59 SO HOW DO WE DO IT WELL
MitchellBesser_2010G@664.63:676 MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT ENGAGEMENT IS THE ONE TO ONE SEEING PATIENTS ONE TO ONE EDUCATING THEM SUPPORTING THEM EXPLAINING HOW THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES WE GO BEYOND THAT
MitchellBesser_2010G@676:686.16 WE TRY TO BRING IN THE HUSBANDS THE PARTNERS IN AFRICA IT 'S VERY VERY HARD TO ENGAGE MEN MEN ARE NOT FREQUENTLY PART OF PREGNANCY CARE
MitchellBesser_2010G@686.16:694.69 BUT IN RWANDA IN ONE COUNTRY THEY 'VE GOT A POLICY THAT A WOMAN CAN 'T COME FOR CARE UNLESS SHE BRINGS THE FATHER OF THE BABY WITH HER
MitchellBesser_2010G@694.69:706.76 THAT 'S THE RULE AND SO THE FATHER AND THE MOTHER TOGETHER GO THROUGH THE COUNSELING AND THE TESTING THE FATHER AND THE MOTHER TOGETHER THEY GET THE RESULTS AND THIS IS SO IMPORTANT IN BREAKING THROUGH THE STIGMA
MitchellBesser_2010G@706.76:722.93 DISCLOSURE IS SO CENTRAL TO PREVENTION HOW DO YOU HAVE SAFER SEX HOW DO YOU USE A CONDOM REGULARLY IF THERE HASN 'T BEEN DISCLOSURE DISCLOSURE IS SO IMPORTANT TO TREATMENT BECAUSE AGAIN PEOPLE NEED THE SUPPORT OF FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS TO TAKE THEIR MEDICINES REGULARLY
MitchellBesser_2010G@725.33:743.79 WE ALSO WORK IN GROUPS NOW THE GROUPS IT 'S NOT LIKE ME LECTURING BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS WOMEN THEY COME TOGETHER UNDER THE SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE OF OUR MENTOR MOTHERS THEY COME TOGETHER AND THEY SHARE THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND IT 'S THROUGH THE SHARING THAT PEOPLE GET TACTICS OF HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES HOW TO DISCLOSE HOW TO TAKE MEDICINES
MitchellBesser_2010G@743.79:747.4 AND THEN THERE 'S THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH ENGAGING WOMEN
MitchellBesser_2010G@747.41:765.78 IN THEIR COMMUNITIES IF WE CAN CHANGE THE WAY HOUSEHOLDS BELIEVE AND THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE WAY COMMUNITIES BELIEVE AND THINK AND IF WE CAN CHANGE ENOUGH COMMUNITIES WE CAN CHANGE NATIONAL ATTITUDES WE CAN CHANGE NATIONAL ATTITUDES TO WOMEN AND NATIONAL ATTITUDES TO HIV
MitchellBesser_2010G@765.78:778.37 THE HARDEST BARRIER REALLY IS AROUND STIGMA REDUCTION WE HAVE THE MEDICINES WE HAVE THE TESTS BUT HOW DO YOU REDUCE THE STIGMA AND IT 'S IMPORTANT ABOUT DISCLOSURE SO A COUPLE YEARS AGO ONE OF THE MENTOR MOTHERS CAME BACK AND SHE TOLD ME A STORY
MitchellBesser_2010G@778.37:797.18 SHE HAD BEEN ASKED BY ONE OF THE CLIENTS TO GO TO THE HOME OF THE CLIENT BECAUSE THE CLIENT WANTED TO TELL THE MOTHER AND HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS ABOUT HER HIV STATUS AND SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO BY HERSELF AND SO THE MENTOR MOTHER WENT ALONG WITH AND THE PATIENT WALKED INTO THE HOUSE AND SAID TO HER MOTHER AND SIBLINGS I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU I 'M
MitchellBesser_2010G@809.31:816.68 AND THEN THIS OLDER SISTER STOOD UP AND SAID I TOO AM LIVING WITH THE VIRUS AND I 'VE BEEN ASHAMED
MitchellBesser_2010G@816.68:829.58 AND THEN HER YOUNGER BROTHER STOOD UP AND SAID I 'M ALSO POSITIVE I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO THROW ME OUT OF THE FAMILY AND YOU SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING THE LAST SISTER STOOD UP AND SAID I 'M ALSO POSITIVE I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO HATE ME
MitchellBesser_2010G@829.58:838.92 AND THERE THEY WERE ALL OF THEM TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME BEING ABLE TO SHARE THIS EXPERIENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME
MitchellBesser_2010G@864.34:869.29 REMEMBER THE IMAGES I SHOWED YOU OF HOW FEW DOCTORS AND NURSES THERE ARE IN AFRICA AND IT IS
MitchellBesser_2010G@869.29:886.44 A CRISIS IN HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS EVEN AS WE HAVE MORE TESTS AND MORE DRUGS WE CAN 'T REACH PEOPLE WE DON 'T HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS SO WE TALK IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CALL TASK SHIFTING TASK SHIFTING IS TRADITIONALLY WHEN YOU TAKE HEALTH CARE SERVICES FROM ONE PROVIDER AND HAVE ANOTHER PROVIDER DO IT TYPICALLY IT 'S A DOCTOR GIVING A JOB TO A NURSE AND
MitchellBesser_2010G@886.44:895.29 THE ISSUE IN AFRICA IS THAT THERE ARE FEWER NURSES REALLY THAN DOCTORS AND SO WE NEED TO FIND NEW PARADIGM FOR HEALTH CARE HOW DO YOU BUILD A BETTER HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
MitchellBesser_2010G@895.3:914.37 WE 'VE CHOSEN TO REDEFINE THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AS A DOCTOR A NURSE AND A MENTOR MOTHER AND SO WHAT NURSES DO IS THAT THEY ASK THE MENTOR MOTHERS TO EXPLAIN HOW TO TAKE THE DRUGS THE SIDE EFFECTS THEY DELEGATE EDUCATION ABOUT INFANT FEEDING FAMILY PLANNING SAFER SEX ACTIONS THAT NURSES SIMPLE JUST DON 'T HAVE TIME FOR
MitchellBesser_2010G@914.37:927.02 SO WE GO BACK TO THE PREVENTION OF MOTHER TO CHILD TRANSMISSION THE WORLD IS INCREASINGLY SEEING THESE PROGRAMS AS THE BRIDGE TO COMPREHENSIVE MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH AND OUR ORGANIZATION HELPS WOMEN ACROSS THAT BRIDGE
MitchellBesser_2010G@927.02:937.4 THE CARE DOESN 'T STOP WHEN THE BABY 'S BORN WE DEAL WITH THE ONGOING HEALTH OF THE MOTHER AND BABY ENSURING THAT THEY LIVE HEALTHY SUCCESSFUL LIVES
MitchellBesser_2010G@937.4:950.93 OUR ORGANIZATION WORKS ON THREE LEVELS THE FIRST AT THE PATIENT LEVEL MOTHERS AND BABIES KEEPING BABIES FROM GETTING HIV KEEPING MOTHERS HEALTHY TO RAISE THEM THE SECOND COMMUNITIES EMPOWERING WOMEN
MitchellBesser_2010G@950.93:964.33 THEY BECOME LEADERS WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES THEY CHANGE THE WAY COMMUNITIES THINK WE NEED TO CHANGE ATTITUDES TO HIV WE NEED TO CHANGE ATTITUDES TO WOMEN IN AFRICA WE HAVE TO DO THAT AND THEN
MitchellBesser_2010G@970.44:985.7 THEY 'RE NOT GOING TO WORK THE WAY THEY 'RE CURRENTLY DESIGNED AND SO DOCTORS AND NURSES WHO NEED TO TRY TO CHANGE PEOPLE 'S BEHAVIORS DON 'T HAVE THE SKILLS DON 'T HAVE THE TIME OUR MENTOR MOTHERS DO AND SO IN REDEFINING THE HEALTH CARE TEAMS BY BRINGING THE MENTOR MOTHERS IN WE CAN DO THAT
MitchellBesser_2010G@985.7:997.52 I STARTED THE PROGRAM IN CAPETOWN SOUTH AFRICA BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE IT WAS AT THAT POINT JUST THE SPARK OF AN IDEA REFERENCING STEVEN JOHNSON 'S
MitchellBesser_2010G@997.53:1006.61 VERY LOVELY SPEECH YESTERDAY ON WHERE IDEAS COME FROM I WAS IN THE SHOWER AT THE TIME I WAS ALONE
MitchellBesser_2010G@1010.35:1021.21 THE PROGRAM IS NOW WORKING IN NINE COUNTRIES WE HAVE SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PROGRAM SITES WE 'RE SEEING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND WOMEN EVERY MONTH
MitchellBesser_2010G@1021.21:1033.43 WE 'RE EMPLOYING ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED MENTOR MOTHERS AND LAST YEAR THEY ENROLLED THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND HIV POSITIVE PREGNANT WOMEN AND MOTHERS THAT IS TWENTY PERCENT OF THE GLOBAL
MitchellBesser_2010G@1033.61:1048.35 HIV POSITIVE PREGNANT WOMEN TWENTY PERCENT OF THE WORLD WHAT 'S EXTRAORDINARY IS HOW SIMPLE THE PREMISE IS MOTHERS WITH HIV CARING FOR MOTHERS WITH HIV PAST PATIENTS TAKING CARE OF PRESENT PATIENTS AND EMPOWERMENT THROUGH EMPLOYMENT REDUCING STIGMA
MitchellBesser_2010G@1057.23:1075.74 EACH PERSON MUST KNOW THEIR HIV STATUS THOSE WHO ARE HIV NEGATIVE MUST KNOW HOW TO STAY NEGATIVE THOSE WHO ARE HIV INFECTED MUST KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES
MitchellBesser_2010G@1085.39:1091.52 ALL OF THIS IS POSSIBLE IF WE EACH CONTRIBUTE TO THIS
