RaghavaKK_2010 I THINK IT WAS IN MY SECOND GRADE THAT I WAS CAUGHT DRAWING THE BUST OF A NUDE BY MICHELANGELO I WAS SENT STRAIGHT AWAY TO MY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL
RaghavaKK_2010 AND MY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL A SWEET NUN
RaghavaKK_2010 LOOKED AT MY BOOK WITH DISGUST FLIPPED THROUGH THE PAGES SAW ALL THE NUDES YOU KNOW I'D BEEN SEEING MY MOTHER DRAW NUDES AND I'D COPY HER
RaghavaKK_2010 AND THE NUN SLAPPED ME ON MY FACE AND SAID
RaghavaKK_2010 BUT IT WAS CONVINCING ENOUGH FOR ME NEVER TO DRAW AGAIN UNTIL THE NINTH GRADE THANKS TO A REALLY BORING LECTURE I STARTED CARICATURING MY TEACHERS IN SCHOOL
RaghavaKK_2010 AND YOU KNOW I GOT A LOT OF POPULARITY I DON'T PLAY SPORTS I'M REALLY BAD AT SPORTS I DON'T HAVE THE FANCIEST GADGETS AT HOME
RaghavaKK_2010 I'M NOT ON TOP OF THE CLASS SO FOR ME CARTOONING GAVE ME A SENSE OF IDENTITY I GOT POPULAR BUT I WAS SCARED I'D GET CAUGHT AGAIN SO WHAT I DID WAS I QUICKLY PUT TOGETHER A COLLAGE OF ALL THE TEACHERS I HAD DRAWN
RaghavaKK_2010 GLORIFIED MY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL PUT HIM RIGHT ON TOP AND GIFTED IT TO HIM HE HAD A GOOD LAUGH AT THE OTHER TEACHERS AND PUT IT UP ON THE NOTICE BOARD
RaghavaKK_2010 THIS IS A PART OF
RaghavaKK_2010 I BECAME A SCHOOL HERO ALL MY SENIORS KNEW ME I FELT REALLY SPECIAL I HAVE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY FAMILY THAT'S MY MOTHER
RaghavaKK_2010 I LOVE HER TO BITS SHE'S THE ONE WHO TAUGHT ME HOW TO DRAW AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW TO LOVE SHE'S A BIT OF A HIPPIE SHE SAID DON 'T SAY THAT BUT I'M SAYING IT ANYWAY
RaghavaKK_2010 THE REST OF MY FAMILY ARE BORING ACADEMICS BUSY COLLECTING IVY LEAGUE DECALS FOR OUR CLASSIC AMBASSADOR CAR MY FATHER 'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT MY FATHER BELIEVED IN A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO LIVING AND YOU KNOW EVERY TIME HE TAUGHT
RaghavaKK_2010 THESE BOOKS BECAUSE THESE BOOKS ARE HIJACKED BY INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION WHILE HE STILL HELD THAT WORLDVIEW I WAS SIXTEEN I GOT THE BEST LAWYER IN TOWN MY OLDER BROTHER KARTHIK AND I SAT HIM DOWN AND I SAID
RaghavaKK_2010 HE WAS VERY IMPRESSED HE WAS ALL TEARING UP READY TO HUG ME AND I SAID HOLD THAT THOUGHT I SAID CAN I QUITE SCHOOL THEN
RaghavaKK_2010 BUT TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT I QUIT SCHOOL TO PURSUE A CAREER AS A CARTOONIST I MUST HAVE DONE ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND CARICATURES I WOULD DO BIRTHDAY PARTIES WEDDINGS DIVORCES ANYTHING FOR ANYONE WHO WANTED TO USE MY SERVICES
RaghavaKK_2010 BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WHILE I WAS TRAVELING I TAUGHT CHILDREN CARTOONING AND IN EXCHANGE I LEARNED HOW TO BE SPONTANEOUS AND MAD AND CRAZY AND FUN WHEN I STARTED TEACHING THEM I SAID LET ME START DOING THIS PROFESSIONALLY
RaghavaKK_2010 WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN I STARTED MY OWN SCHOOL HOWEVER AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD TRYING TO START A SCHOOL IS NOT EASY UNLESS YOU HAVE
RaghavaKK_2010 A BIG PATRON OR A BIG SUPPORTER SO I WAS FLIPPING THROUGH THE PAGES OF THE TIMES OF INDIA WHEN I SAW THAT THE PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA WAS VISITING
RaghavaKK_2010 MY HOME TOWN BANGALORE
RaghavaKK_2010 AND YOU KNOW JUST LIKE HOW EVERY CARTOONIST KNOWS BUSH HERE AND IF YOU HAD TO MEET BUSH IT WOULD BE THE FUNNEST THING BECAUSE HIS FACE WAS A CARTOONIST 'S DELIGHT I HAD TO MEET MY PRIME MINISTER
RaghavaKK_2010 I WENT TO THE PLACE WHERE HIS HELICOPTER WAS ABOUT TO LAND I SAW LAYERS OF SECURITY I CARICATURED MY WAY THROUGH THREE LAYERS BY JUST IMPRESSING THE
RaghavaKK_2010 I I HOPPED INTO HIS CAR AND OFF WE WENT THROUGH
RaghavaKK_2010 I SAT HIM DOWN I CARICATURED HIM AND SINCE THEN I'VE CARICATURED HUNDREDS OF CELEBRITIES THIS IS ONE I REMEMBER FONDLY SALMAN RUSHDIE WAS PISSED OFF I THINK BECAUSE I ALTERED THE MAP OF NEW YORK
RaghavaKK_2010 ANYWAY THE NEXT SLIDE I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU
RaghavaKK_2010 THE NEXT SLIDE I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU IS A LITTLE MORE SERIOUS I WAS HESITANT TO INCLUDE THIS IN MY PRESENTATION BECAUSE THIS CARTOON WAS PUBLISHED
RaghavaKK_2010 SOON AFTER NINE ELEVEN WHAT WAS FOR ME A VERY NAIVE OBSERVATION TURNED OUT TO BE A DISASTER
RaghavaKK_2010 THAT EVENING I CAME HOME TO HUNDREDS OF HATE MAILS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TELLING ME HOW THEY COULD HAVE LIVED ANOTHER DAY WITHOUT SEEING THIS I WAS ALSO ASKED TO LEAVE
RaghavaKK_2010 THE ORGANIZATION A CARTOONISTS ORGANIZATION IN AMERICA
RaghavaKK_2010 THAT FOR ME WAS MY LIFELINE THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED YOU KNOW CARTOONS ARE REALLY POWERFUL ART COMES WITH RESPONSIBILITY ANYWAY WHAT I DID WAS I DECIDED
RaghavaKK_2010 THAT I NEED TO TAKE A BREAK I QUIT MY JOB AT THE PAPERS I CLOSED MY SCHOOL AND I WRAPPED UP MY PENCILS AND MY BRUSHES AND INKS AND I DECIDED TO GO TRAVELING
RaghavaKK_2010 WHEN I WENT TRAVELING I REMEMBER I MET THIS FABULOUS OLD MAN WHO I MET WHEN I WAS CARICATURING WHO TURNED OUT TO BE AN ARTIST
RaghavaKK_2010 I SAID OH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT AND I ASKED HIM AND HE SAID OH THAT THING IN THE NIGHT I DIE IN THE MORNING I AM BORN AGAIN
RaghavaKK_2010 SO I TRIED GOING TO THE ART STORE
RaghavaKK_2010 YOU KNOW THERE ARE A HUNDRED TYPES OF BRUSHES FORGET IT THEY WILL CONFUSE YOU EVEN IF YOU KNOW HOW TO DRAW SO I DECIDED I'M GOING TO LEARN TO PAINT BY MYSELF I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A VERY QUICK CLIP TO SHOW YOU HOW I PAINTED AND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY CITY BANGALORE
RaghavaKK_2010 THEY HAD TO BE LARGER THAN LIFE EVERYTHING HAD TO BE LARGER THE NEXT PAINTING WAS EVEN BIGGER AND EVEN BIGGER AND FOR ME IT WAS I HAD TO DANCE WHILE I PAINTED IT WAS SO EXCITING EXCEPT
RaghavaKK_2010 I DIDN'T KNOW THE DANCE FORM SO I STARTED FOLLOWING THEM AND I MADE SOME MONEY SOLD MY PAINTINGS AND WOULD RUSH OFF TO FRANCE OR SPAIN
RaghavaKK_2010 AND WORK WITH THEM THAT'S PEPE LINARES A RENOWNED FLAMENCO SINGER BUT I HAD ONE PROBLEM MY PAINTINGS NEVER DANCED
RaghavaKK_2010 AS MUCH ENERGY AS I PUT INTO THEM WHILE MAKING THEM THEY NEVER DANCED SO I DECIDED I HAD THIS CRAZY EPIPHANY AT TWO IN THE MORNING I CALLED MY FRIENDS PAINTED ON THEIR BODIES AND HAD THEM DANCE IN FRONT OF A PAINTING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN MY PAINTINGS CAME ALIVE
RaghavaKK_2010 AND THEN I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY PERFORM THIS IN CALIFORNIA WITH VELOCITY CIRCUS AND I SAT LIKE YOU GUYS THERE IN THE AUDIENCE AND I SAW MY WORK COME ALIVE YOU KNOW NORMALLY YOU WORK IN ISOLATION AND
RaghavaKK_2010 THE WORK WAS COMING ALIVE AND IT HAD SOME OTHER ARTISTS WORKING WITH ME THE COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WAS FABULOUS I SAID I'M GOING TO COLLABORATE WITH ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY I MEET I STARTED DOING FASHION THIS IS A FASHION SHOW WE HELD IN LONDON
RaghavaKK_2010 THE BEST COLLABORATION OF COURSE IS WITH CHILDREN
RaghavaKK_2010 AND I MUST SAY I SPENT TIME IN THE BRONX WORKING WITH THESE KIDS AND IN EXCHANGE FOR ME WORKING WITH THEM THEY TAUGHT ME HOW TO BE COOL I DON'T THINK I'VE SUCCEEDED BUT THEY'VE TAUGHT ME THEY SAID STOP

RaghavaKK_2010 ALL THIS IS GOOD BUT I WANT TO PAINT LIKE A
