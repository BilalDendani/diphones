BarbaraBlock_2010Z@26.72:39.87 THEY'RE THE LARGEST OF THE TUNAS THE SECOND LARGEST FISH IN THE SEA BONY FISH THEY ACTUALLY ARE A FISH THAT IS ENDOTHERMIC POWERS THROUGH THE OCEAN WITH WARM MUSCLES LIKE A MAMMAL
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@47.92:56.34 FOR OCEAN SWIMMING IT FLIES THROUGH THE OCEAN ON ITS PECTORAL FINS GETS LIFT POWERS ITS MOVEMENTS WITH A LUNATE TAIL
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@65.96:75.78 NOW BLUEFIN WERE REVERED BY MAN FOR ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY FOR FOUR THOUSAND YEARS WE FISHED SUSTAINABLY FOR THIS ANIMAL
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@76.12:86.94 AND IT'S EVIDENCED IN THE ART THAT WE SEE FROM THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO BLUEFIN ARE IN CAVE PAINTINGS IN FRANCE THEY'RE IN COINS THAT DATE BACK
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@87.45:100.90 THREE THOUSAND YEARS THIS FISH WAS REVERED BY HUMANKIND IT WAS FISHED SUSTAINABLY TILL ALL OF TIME EXCEPT FOR OUR GENERATION BLUEFIN ARE PURSUED WHEREVER THEY GO
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@101.53:109.86 THERE IS A GOLD RUSH ON EARTH AND THIS IS A GOLD RUSH FOR BLUEFIN THERE ARE TRAPS THAT FISH SUSTAINABLY UP UNTIL RECENTLY
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@110.54:119.97 AND YET THE TYPE OF FISHING GOING ON TODAY WITH PENS WITH ENORMOUS STAKES IS REALLY WIPING BLUEFIN ECOLOGICALLY OFF THE PLANET
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@120.28:128.61 NOW BLUEFIN IN GENERAL GOES TO ONE PLACE JAPAN SOME OF YOU MAY BE GUILTY OF HAVING CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEMISE OF BLUEFIN
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@128.99:137.33 THEY'RE DELECTABLE MUSCLE RICH IN FAT ABSOLUTELY TASTE DELICIOUS AND THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM WE'RE EATING THEM TO DEATH
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@137.76:147.90 NOW IN THE ATLANTIC THE STORY IS PRETTY SIMPLE BLUEFIN HAVE TWO POPULATIONS ONE LARGE ONE SMALL THE NORTH AMERICAN POPULATION IS FISHED AT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TON
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@148.29:157.69 THE EUROPEAN POPULATION AND NORTH AFRICAN THE EASTERN BLUEFIN TUNA IS FISHED AT TREMENDOUS LEVELS FIFTY THOUSAND TONS OVER THE LAST DECADE ALMOST EVERY YEAR
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@158.00:167.43 THE RESULT IS WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE WEST OR THE EASTERN BLUEFIN POPULATION THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS DECLINE ON BOTH SIDES AS MUCH AS NINETY PERCENT IF YOU GO BACK
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@175.87:185.78 TO LIONS TO CERTAIN AFRICAN ELEPHANTS AND TO PANDAS THESE FISH HAVE BEEN PROPOSED FOR AN ENDANGERED SPECIES LISTING IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@186.13:193.70 THEY WERE VOTED ON AND REJECTED JUST TWO WEEKS AGO DESPITE OUTSTANDING SCIENCE THAT SHOWS FROM TWO COMMITTEES
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@194.24:202.26 THIS FISH MEETS THE CRITERIA OF CITES I AND IF IT'S TUNAS YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT PERHAPS YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED THAT INTERNATIONAL LONG LINES
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@203.60:214.87 CHASE DOWN TUNAS AND BYCATCH ANIMALS SUCH AS LEATHERBACKS SHARKS MARLIN ALBATROSS THESE ANIMALS AND THEIR DEMISE OCCURS IN THE TUNA FISHERIES
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@216.20:223.51 THE CHALLENGE WE FACE IS THAT WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT TUNA AND EVERYONE IN THE ROOM KNOWS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@224.01:235.74 WHEN AN AFRICAN LION TAKES DOWN ITS PREY I DOUBT ANYONE HAS SEEN A GIANT BLUEFIN FEED THIS TUNA SYMBOLIZES WHAT'S THE PROBLEM FOR ALL OF US IN THE ROOM
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@247.64:256.75 AND GO DEEP INTO THE SEAS REMOTELY AND WE'VE GOT TO USE THESE TECHNOLOGIES IMMEDIATELY TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OUR OCEAN REALM WORKS
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@257.40:270.39 MOST OF US FROM THE SHIP EVEN I LOOK OUT AT THE OCEAN AND SEE THIS HOMOGENEOUS SEA WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE STRUCTURE IS WE CAN'T TELL WHERE ARE THE WATERING HOLES LIKE WE CAN ON AN AFRICAN PLAIN
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@270.88:278.77 WE CAN'T SEE THE CORRIDORS AND WE CAN'T SEE WHAT IT IS THAT BRINGS TOGETHER A TUNA A LEATHERBACK AND AN ALBATROSS
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@279.19:287.20 WE'RE ONLY JUST BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY AND THE BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY COME TOGETHER TO CREATE
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@287.58:295.08 A SEASONAL FORCE THAT ACTUALLY CAUSES THE UPWELLING THAT MIGHT MAKE A HOT SPOT A HOPE SPOT THE REASONS THESE CHALLENGES ARE GREAT
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@295.64:308.14 IS THAT TECHNICALLY IT'S DIFFICULT TO GO TO SEA IT'S HARD TO STUDY A BLUEFIN ON ITS TURF THE ENTIRE PACIFIC REALM IT'S REALLY TOUGH TO GET UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH A MAKO SHARK AND TRY TO PUT A TAG ON IT
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@320.92:330.67 SO THE STORY OF OUR TEAM A DEDICATED TEAM IS FISH AND CHIPS WE BASICALLY ARE TAKING THE SAME SATELLITE PHONE PARTS OR THE SAME
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@339.77:348.74 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'RE ABLE TO WATCH THE JOURNEY OF A TUNA BENEATH THE OCEAN USING LIGHT AND PHOTONS TO MEASURE SUNRISE AND SUNSET
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@349.55:356.01 NOW I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH TUNAS FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING A PARTNER WITH THE MONTERREY BAY AQUARIUM
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@356.52:365.64 WE'VE ACTUALLY TAKEN A SLIVER OF THE OCEAN PUT IT BEHIND GLASS AND WE TOGETHER HAVE PUT BLUEFIN TUNA AND YELLOWFIN TUNA ON DISPLAY
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@366.13:375.82 WHEN THE VEIL OF BUBBLES LIFTS EVERY MORNING WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE A COMMUNITY FROM THE PELAGIC OCEAN ONE OF THE ONLY PLACES ON EARTH YOU CAN SEE GIANT BLUEFIN SWIM BY
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@376.41:384.05 WE CAN SEE IN THEIR BEAUTY OF FORM AND FUNCTION THEIR CEASELESS ACTIVITY THEY'RE FLYING THROUGH THEIR SPACE OCEAN SPACE
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@399.89:410.62 BROUGHT IN BOTH BLUEFIN AND YELLOWFIN IN CAPTIVITY WE'D BEEN STUDYING THESE FISH BUT FIRST WE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO HUSBANDRY THEM WHAT DO THEY LIKE TO EAT WHAT IS IT THAT THEY'RE HAPPY WITH
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@411.00:420.46 WE GO IN THE TANKS WITH THE TUNA WE TOUCH THEIR NAKED SKIN IT'S PRETTY AMAZING IT FEELS WONDERFUL AND THEN BETTER YET WE'VE GOT OUR OWN VERSION OF TUNA WHISPERERS
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@420.64:428.10 OUR OWN CHUCK FARWELL ALEX NORTON WHO CAN TAKE A BIG TUNA AND IN ONE MOTION PUT IT INTO AN ENVELOPE OF WATER
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@428.49:437.37 SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY WORK WITH THE TUNA AND LEARN THE TECHNIQUES IT TAKES TO NOT INJURE THIS FISH WHO NEVER SEES A BOUNDARY IN THE OPEN SEA
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@452.48:459.57 WE'RE TAKING THIS DATA AND BUILDING BETTER MODELS AND WHEN I SEE THAT TUNA THIS IS MY FAVORITE VIEW I BEGIN TO WONDER
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@459.83:468.18 HOW DID THIS FISH SOLVE THE LONGITUDE PROBLEM BEFORE WE DID SO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ANIMAL THAT'S THE CLOSEST YOU'LL PROBABLY EVER GET
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@468.99:478.41 NOW THE ACTIVITIES FROM THE LAB HAVE TAUGHT US NOW HOW TO GO OUT IN THE OPEN OCEAN SO IN A PROGRAM CALLED TAG A GIANT WE'VE ACTUALLY GONE
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@479.07:492.16 IRELAND TO CANADA FROM CORSICA TO SPAIN WE'VE FISHED WITH MANY NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD IN AN EFFORT TO BASICALLY PUT ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS INSIDE GIANT TUNAS
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@501.14:510.81 IT'S A VERY HARD PROCESS BUT IT'S A BALLET WE BRING THE TUNA OUT WE MEASURE IT A TEAM OF FISHERS CAPTAINS SCIENTISTS AND TECHNICIANS WORK TOGETHER
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@511.11:520.00 TO KEEP THIS ANIMAL OUT OF THE OCEAN FOR ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE MINUTES WE PUT WATER OVER ITS GILLS GIVE IT OXYGEN AND THEN WITH A LOT OF EFFORT
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@534.28:541.60 AND FROM OUR DATA THAT GETS COLLECTED WHEN THAT TAG COMES BACK BECAUSE A FISHER RETURNS IT FOR A THOUSAND DOLLAR
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@554.89:566.61 THE SIZE OF THE BIGGEST TUNA WE'VE EVER TAGGED IT TAKES A HUMAN EFFORT A TEAM EFFORT TO BRING THE FISH IN IN THIS CASE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS PUT A POP UP SATELLITE ARCHIVAL TAG ON THE TUNA
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@567.40:575.20 THIS TAG RIDES ON THE TUNA SENSES THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND THE TUNA AND ACTUALLY WILL COME OFF THE FISH
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@575.72:583.56 DETACH FLOAT TO THE SURFACE AND SEND BACK TO EARTH ORBITING SATELLITES POSITION DATA ESTIMATED BY MATH ON THE TAG
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@594.06:606.83 BOTH THE ELECTRONIC TAGS I'M TALKING ABOUT ARE EXPENSIVE THESE TAGS HAVE BEEN ENGINEERED BY A VARIETY OF TEAMS IN NORTH AMERICA THEY ARE SOME OF OUR FINEST INSTRUMENTS OUR NEW TECHNOLOGY IN THE OCEAN TODAY
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@607.51:617.62 ONE COMMUNITY IN GENERAL HAS GIVEN MORE TO HELP US THAN ANY OTHER COMMUNITY AND THAT'S THE FISHERIES OFF THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA THERE ARE TWO VILLAGES HARRIS AND MOREHEAD CITY
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@625.77:638.38 EIGHT HUNDRED TO NINE HUNDRED FISH IN THIS CASE WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO MEASURE THE FISH WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE STARTED TAKE A MUCUS SAMPLE WATCH HOW SHINY THE SKIN IS YOU CAN SEE MY REFLECTION THERE
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@638.78:647.67 AND FROM THAT MUCUS WE CAN GET GENE PROFILES WE CAN GET INFORMATION ON GENDER CHECKING THE POP UP TAG ONE MORE TIME AND THEN IT'S OUT IN THE OCEAN
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@662.58:672.07 THE TUNA WANTS TO GO IT WANTS TO FORAGE ON SCHOOLS OF HERRING BUT IT CAN'T GET THERE IT'S TOO COLD BUT THEN IT WARMS UP AND THE TUNA POPS IN GETS SOME FISH MAYBE COMES BACK TO HOME BASE
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@672.73:684.12 GOES IN AGAIN AND THEN COMES BACK TO WINTER DOWN THERE IN NORTH CAROLINA AND THEN ON TO THE BAHAMAS AND MY FAVORITE SCENE THREE TUNAS GOING INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO THREE TUNAS TAGGED
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@694.01:701.28 SO FROM DATA LIKE THIS WE'RE ABLE NOW TO PUT THE MAP UP AND IN THIS MAP YOU SEE THOUSANDS OF POSITIONS
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@724.04:737.53 ON THE HOT SPOTS THE HOPE SPOTS THEY'RE MIXED POPULATIONS AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE SCIENCE IS WE'RE SHOWING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION BUILDING NEW MODELS SHOWING THEM THAT A TWO STOCK NO MIXING MODEL TO THIS DAY USED
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@737.80:746.49 TO REJECT THE CITES TREATY THAT MODEL ISN'T THE RIGHT MODEL THIS IS MODEL A MODEL OF OVERLAP IS THE WAY TO MOVE FORWARD
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@746.95:757.70 SO WE CAN THEN PREDICT WHERE MANAGEMENT PLACES SHOULD BE PLACES LIKE THE GULF OF MEXICO AND THE MEDITERRANEAN ARE PLACES WHERE THE SINGLE SPECIES THE SINGLE POPULATION CAN BE CAPTURED
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@758.01:770.15 THESE BECOME FORTHRIGHT IN PLACES WE NEED TO PROTECT THE CENTER OF THE ATLANTIC WHERE THE MIXING IS I COULD IMAGINE A POLICY THAT LETS CANADA AND AMERICA FISH BECAUSE THEY MANAGE THEIR FISHERIES WELL THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@780.85:792.38 NOW IN A SECOND PROJECT CALLED TAGGING OF PACIFIC PELAGICS WE TOOK ON THE PLANET AS A TEAM THOSE OF US IN THE CENSUS OF MARINE LIFE AND FUNDED PRIMARILY THROUGH SLOAN FOUNDATION AND OTHERS
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@792.85:802.57 WE WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY GO IN IN OUR PROJECT WE'RE ONE OF SEVENTEEN FIELD PROGRAMS AND BEGIN TO TAKE ON TAGGING LARGE NUMBERS OF PREDATORS NOT JUST TUNAS
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@802.81:810.55 SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS ACTUALLY GONE UP TO TAG SALMON SHARK IN ALASKA MET SALMON SHARK ON THEIR HOME TERRITORY
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@811.46:821.47 THEM CATCHING SALMON AND THEN WENT IN AND FIGURED OUT THAT IF WE TAKE A SALMON AND PUT IT ON A LINE WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE UP A SALMON SHARK THIS IS THE COUSIN OF THE WHITE SHARK
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@821.85:830.21 AND VERY CAREFULLY NOTE I SAY VERY CAREFULLY WE CAN ACTUALLY KEEP IT CALM PUT A HOSE IN ITS MOUTH KEEP IT OFF THE DECK
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@830.73:838.26 AND THEN TAG IT WITH A SATELLITE TAG THAT SATELLITE TAG WILL NOW HAVE YOUR SHARK PHONE HOME AND SEND IN A MESSAGE
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@838.50:848.19 AND THAT SHARK LEAPING THERE IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY HAS AN ANTENNA IT'S A FREE SWIMMING SHARK WITH A SATELLITE TAG JUMPING AFTER SALMON SENDING HOME ITS DATA
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@862.30:873.42 AND COME INTO MONTERREY NOW RIGHT NEXT DOOR IN MONTERREY AND UP AT THE FARALLONES ARE A WHITE SHARK TEAM LED BY SCOTT ANDERSON THERE AND SAL JORGENSEN THEY CAN THROW OUT A TARGET IT'S A CARPET
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@874.04:883.58 SHAPED LIKE A SEAL AND IN WILL COME A WHITE SHARK A CURIOUS CRITTER THAT WILL COME RIGHT UP TO OUR SIXTEEN FT BOAT IT'S A SEVERAL THOUSAND POUND ANIMAL AND
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@912.17:924.25 WE ALSO TAG MAKOS WITH OUR NOAA COLLEAGUES BLUE SHARKS AND NOW TOGETHER WHAT WE CAN SEE ON THIS OCEAN OF COLOR THAT'S TEMPERATURE WE CAN SEE TEN DAY WORMS OF MAKOS AND SALMON SHARKS
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@924.86:933.14 WE HAVE WHITE SHARKS AND BLUE SHARKS FOR THE FIRST TIME AN ECOSCAPE AS LARGE AS OCEAN SCALE SHOWING WHERE THE SHARKS GO
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@952.48:959.45 STICK OUT THE TUNA AND THEN LET THEM GO THEY GET RETURNED AND WHEN THEY GET RETURNED HERE ON A NASA
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@967.66:976.72 OUR TEAM FROM UCSC HAS TAGGED ELEPHANT SEALS WITH TAGS THAT ARE GLUED ON THEIR HEADS THAT COME OFF WHEN THEY SLOUGH THESE ELEPHANT SEALS COVER HALF HALF AN OCEAN
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@1000.11:1009.80 SAME THING WITH LAYSAN ALBATROSS WHO TRAVEL AN ENTIRE OCEAN ON A TRIP SOMETIMES UP TO THE SAME ZONE THE TUNAS USE YOU CAN SEE WHY THEY MIGHT BE CAUGHT
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@1010.65:1024.33 THEN THERE'S GEORGE SCHILLINGER AND OUR LEATHERBACK TEAM OUT OF PLAYA GRANDE TAGGING LEATHERBACKS THAT GO RIGHT PAST WHERE WE ARE AND SCOTT BENSON 'S TEAM THAT SHOWED THAT LEATHERBACKS GO FROM INDONESIA ALL THE WAY TO MONTERREY
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@1024.91:1035.62 SO WHAT WE CAN SEE ON THIS MOVING OCEAN IS WE CAN FINALLY SEE WHERE THE PREDATORS ARE WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE HOW THEY'RE USING ECOSPACES AS LARGE AS AN OCEAN
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@1035.88:1046.06 AND FROM THIS INFORMATION WE CAN BEGIN TO MAP THE HOPE SPOTS RIGHT SO THIS IS JUST THREE YEARS OF DATA RIGHT HERE AND THERE'S A DECADE OF THIS DATA WE SEE THE PULSE AND THE SEASONAL
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@1046.56:1055.99 ACTIVITIES THAT THESE ANIMALS ARE GOING ON SO WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO WITH THIS INFORMATION IS BOIL IT DOWN TO HOT SPOTS
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@1056.78:1070.21 FOUR THOUSAND DEPLOYMENTS A HUGE HERCULEAN TASK TWO THOUSAND TAGS IN AN AREA SHOWN HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST THAT APPEARS TO BE A GATHERING PLACE
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@1071.09:1078.86 AND THEN FOR SORT OF AN ENCORE FROM THESE ANIMALS THEY'RE HELPING US THEY'RE CARRYING INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY TAKING DATA DOWN
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@1079.27:1088.02 TWO THOUSAND METERS THEY'RE TAKING INFORMATION FROM OUR PLANET AT VERY CRITICAL PLACES LIKE ANTARCTICA AND THE POLES THOSE ARE SEALS FROM MANY COUNTRIES
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@1103.28:1117.61 AND THEN AS THESE ANIMALS SWIM AND GIVE US THE INFORMATION THAT'S IMPORTANT TO CLIMATE ISSUES WE ALSO THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO GET THIS INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC TO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC WITH THIS KIND OF DATA WE DID THIS WITH THE GREAT TURTLE RACE
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@1118.10:1125.84 TAGGED TURTLES BROUGHT IN FOUR MILLION HITS AND NOW WITH GOOGLE 'S OCEANS WE CAN ACTUALLY PUT A WHITE SHARK IN THAT OCEAN
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@1126.10:1133.51 AND WHEN WE DO AND IT SWIMS WE SEE THIS MAGNIFICENT BATHYMETRY THAT THE SHARK KNOWS IS THERE ON ITS PATH AS IT GOES FROM CALIFORNIA TO HAWAII
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@1133.89:1142.92 BUT MAYBE MISSION BLUE CAN FILL IN THAT OCEAN THAT WE CAN'T SEE WE'VE GOT THE CAPACITY NASA HAS THE OCEAN WE JUST NEED TO PUT IT TOGETHER
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@1143.62:1152.70 SO IN CONCLUSION WE KNOW WHERE YELLOWSTONE IS FOR NORTH AMERICA IT'S OFF OUR COAST WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S SHOWN US WHERE IT IS
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@1152.92:1162.81 WHAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT PERHAPS FOR MISSION BLUE IS INCREASING THE BIOLOGGING CAPACITY HOW IS IT THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY ELSEWHERE
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@1172.98:1183.76 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE EXCITED WHEN SHARKS ACTUALLY WENT UNDER THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE LET 'S CONNECT THE PUBLIC TO THIS ACTIVITY RIGHT ON THEIR IPHONE THAT WAY WE DO AWAY WITH A FEW INTERNET MYTHS
BarbaraBlock_2010Z@1184.59:1198.44 SO WE CAN SAVE THE BLUEFIN TUNA WE CAN SAVE THE WHITE SHARK WE HAVE THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY HOPE IS HERE YES WE CAN WE NEED JUST TO APPLY THIS CAPACITY FURTHER IN THE OCEANS THANK YOU
