KeesMoeliker_2013 NEXT TO THE MUSEUM IT WAS MADE OF GLASS
KeesMoeliker_2013 AND THIS BUILDING REALLY HELPED ME TO DO MY JOB GOOD
KeesMoeliker_2013 THE BUILDING WAS A TRUE BIRD KILLER
KeesMoeliker_2013 YOU MAY KNOW THAT BIRDS DON 'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF GLASS THEY DON 'T SEE IT SO THEY FLY INTO THE WINDOWS AND GET KILLED
KeesMoeliker_2013 AND IT WAS ON
KeesMoeliker_2013 THAT I HEARD A LOUD BANG AGAINST THE GLASS THAT CHANGED MY LIFE AND ENDED THAT OF A DUCK
KeesMoeliker_2013 AND THIS IS WHAT I SAW WHEN I LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW

KeesMoeliker_2013 THAT MUST BE NECROPHILIA

KeesMoeliker_2013 TOOK A CHAIR AND STARTED TO OBSERVE THIS BEHAVIOR
KeesMoeliker_2013 AFTER SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES
KeesMoeliker_2013 AND I WANTED TO GO HOME SO I WENT OUT COLLECTED THE DUCK AND BEFORE I PUT IT IN THE FREEZER I CHECKED IF THE VICTIM WAS INDEED OF THE MALE SEX
KeesMoeliker_2013 AND HERE 'S A RARE PICTURE OF A DUCK 'S PENIS SO IT WAS INDEED OF THE MALE SEX IT 'S A RARE PICTURE BECAUSE THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND SPECIES OF BIRDS AND ONLY THREE HUNDRED POSSESS A PENIS
KeesMoeliker_2013 I MEAN IT 'S A NICE TOPIC FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY OR AT THE COFFEE MACHINE
KeesMoeliker_2013 BUT TO SHARE THIS AMONG YOUR PEERS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT I DIDN 'T HAVE THE FRAMEWORK SO AFTER SIX YEARS MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES URGED ME TO PUBLISH SO I PUBLISHED THE FIRST CASE OF HOMOSEXUAL NECROPHILIA IN THE MALLARD

KeesMoeliker_2013 THE ONLY THING THIS BIRD DID WAS FLY AGAINST THIS WINDOW
KeesMoeliker_2013 AND HERE 'S A SHORT VIDEO
KeesMoeliker_2013 SO WHAT THIS BIRD DOES IS FIGHT HIS OWN IMAGE
KeesMoeliker_2013 HE SEES AN INTRUDER IN HIS TERRITORY
KeesMoeliker_2013 AND I THOUGHT IN THE BEGINNING I STUDIED THIS BIRD FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS THAT WELL SHOULDN 'T THE BRAIN OF THIS BIRD BE DAMAGED IT 'S NOT I SHOW YOU HERE SOME SLIDES SOME FRAMES FROM THE VIDEO AND AT THE LAST MOMENT BEFORE HE HITS THE GLASS HE PUTS HIS FEET IN FRONT AND THEN HE BANGS AGAINST THE GLASS
