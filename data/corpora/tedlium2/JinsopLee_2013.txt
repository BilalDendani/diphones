JinsopLee_2013 WHY IS SEX SO DAMN GOOD
JinsopLee_2013 HERE 'S MY CLOCK IT USES SOMETHING CALLED THE DWARF SUNFLOWER WHICH GROWS TO ABOUT TWELVE INCHES IN HEIGHT NOW AS YOU KNOW SUNFLOWERS TRACK THE SUN DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY SO IN THE MORNING YOU SEE WHICH DIRECTION THE SUNFLOWER IS FACING AND YOU MARK IT
JinsopLee_2013 ON THE BLANK AREA IN THE BASE AT NOON YOU MARK THE CHANGED POSITION OF THE SUNFLOWER AND IN THE EVENING AGAIN AND THAT 'S YOUR CLOCK
JinsopLee_2013 NOW I KNOW MY CLOCK DOESN 'T TELL YOU THE EXACT TIME BUT IT DOES GIVE YOU A GENERAL IDEA USING A FLOWER SO IN MY COMPLETELY UNBIASED SUBJECTIVE OPINION IT 'S BRILLIANT
JinsopLee_2013 HOWEVER HERE 'S CHRIS CLOCK IT 'S FIVE MAGNIFYING GLASSES WITH A SHOT GLASS UNDER EACH ONE IN EACH SHOT GLASS IS A DIFFERENT SCENTED OIL IN THE MORNING THE SUNLIGHT WILL SHINE DOWN ON THE FIRST MAGNIFYING GLASS FOCUSING A BEAM OF LIGHT ON THE SHOT GLASS UNDERNEATH
JinsopLee_2013 THIS WILL WARM UP THE SCENTED OIL INSIDE AND A PARTICULAR SMELL WILL BE EMITTED A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER THE SUN WILL SHINE ON THE NEXT MAGNIFYING GLASS AND A DIFFERENT SMELL WILL BE EMITTED SO DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY FIVE DIFFERENT SMELLS ARE DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THAT ENVIRONMENT ANYONE LIVING IN THAT HOUSE CAN TELL THE TIME JUST BY THE SMELL
JinsopLee_2013 YOU CAN SEE WHY I HATE CHRIS I THOUGHT MY IDEA WAS PRETTY GOOD BUT HIS IDEA IS GENIUS AND AT THE TIME I KNEW HIS IDEA WAS BETTER THAN MINE BUT I JUST COULDN 'T EXPLAIN WHY ONE THING YOU HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT ME IS I HATE TO LOSE THIS PROBLEM 'S BEEN BUGGING ME FOR WELL OVER A DECADE
JinsopLee_2013 SO I DECIDED TO EVALUATE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES I HAD IN MY LIFE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE FIVE SENSES TO DO THIS I DEVISED SOMETHING CALLED THE FIVE SENSES GRAPH
JinsopLee_2013 ALONG THE Y AXIS YOU HAVE A SCALE FROM ZERO TO TEN AND ALONG THE X AXIS YOU HAVE OF COURSE THE FIVE SENSES ANYTIME I HAD A MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE I WOULD RECORD IT ON THIS GRAPH LIKE A FIVE SENSES DIARY HERE 'S A QUICK VIDEO TO SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS
JinsopLee_2013 THIS
JinsopLee_2013 AND THAT 'S HOW THE FIVE SENSES GRAPH WORKS
JinsopLee_2013 NOW FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS I GATHERED DATA NOT JUST ME BUT ALSO SOME OF MY FRIENDS AND I USED TO TEACH IN UNIVERSITY SO I FORCED MY I MEAN I ASKED MY STUDENTS TO DO THIS AS WELL SO HERE ARE SOME OTHER RESULTS THE FIRST IS FOR INSTANT NOODLES NOW OBVIOUSLY TASTE AND SMELL ARE QUITE HIGH BUT
JinsopLee_2013 NOTICE SOUND IS AT THREE
JinsopLee_2013 MANY PEOPLE TOLD ME A BIG PART OF THE NOODLE EATING EXPERIENCE IS THE SLURPING NOISE YOU KNOW
JinsopLee_2013 IT 'S BECAUSE OF THE TASTE OF DRINKS BUT ALSO IN SOME CASES KISSING IS A BIG PART OF THE CLUBBING EXPERIENCE THESE PEOPLE I STILL DO HANG OUT WITH
JinsopLee_2013 ONE OF THE REASONS IS THAT SMOKERS TOLD ME THE SENSATION OF HOLDING A CIGARETTE AND BRINGING IT UP TO YOUR LIPS IS A BIG PART OF THE SMOKING EXPERIENCE WHICH SHOWS
JinsopLee_2013 IT 'S KIND OF SCARY TO THINK
JinsopLee_2013 HOW WELL CIGARETTES ARE DESIGNED BY THE MANUFACTURERS OKAY NOW WHAT WOULD THE PERFECT EXPERIENCE LOOK LIKE ON THE FIVE SENSES GRAPH
JinsopLee_2013 NOW YOU CAN SEE NOT EVEN AS INTENSE AN EXPERIENCE AS RIDING A MOTORBIKE COMES CLOSE IN FACT IN THE YEARS THAT I GATHERED DATA ONLY ONE EXPERIENCE CAME CLOSE TO BEING THE PERFECT ONE THAT IS OF COURSE SEX
JinsopLee_2013 GREAT SEX RESPONDENTS SAID THAT GREAT SEX HITS ALL OF THE FIVE SENSES AT AN EXTREME LEVEL
JinsopLee_2013 SO THE FIVE SENSES THEORY DOES HELP EXPLAIN WHY SEX IS SO GOOD
JinsopLee_2013 NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THIS FIVE SENSES WORK I SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THE SOLAR POWERED CLOCKS PROJECT FROM MY YOUTH AND I REALIZED THIS THEORY ALSO EXPLAINS WHY CHRIS CLOCK IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN MINE
JinsopLee_2013 YOU SEE MY CLOCK ONLY FOCUSES ON SIGHT AND A LITTLE BIT OF TOUCH
JinsopLee_2013 HERE 'S CHRIS CLOCK
JinsopLee_2013 IT 'S THE FIRST CLOCK EVER THAT USES SMELL TO TELL THE TIME
JinsopLee_2013 AND THAT 'S WHAT THIS THEORY TAUGHT ME ABOUT MY FIELD YOU SEE UP TILL NOW US DESIGNERS WE 'VE MAINLY FOCUSED ON MAKING THINGS LOOK VERY PRETTY AND A LITTLE BIT OF TOUCH WHICH MEANS WE 'VE IGNORED THE OTHER THREE SENSES
JinsopLee_2013 CHRIS CLOCK SHOWS US THAT EVEN RAISING JUST ONE OF THOSE OTHER SENSES CAN MAKE FOR A BRILLIANT PRODUCT
JinsopLee_2013 SO WHAT IF WE STARTED USING THE FIVE SENSES THEORY IN ALL OF OUR DESIGNS HERE 'S THREE QUICK IDEAS I CAME UP WITH
JinsopLee_2013 THIS IS AN IRON YOU KNOW FOR YOUR CLOTHES TO WHICH
JinsopLee_2013 I ADDED A SPRAYING MECHANISM SO YOU FILL UP THE VIAL WITH YOUR FAVORITE SCENT AND YOUR CLOTHES WILL SMELL NICER BUT HOPEFULLY IT SHOULD ALSO MAKE THE IRONING EXPERIENCE MORE ENJOYABLE WE COULD CALL THIS THE PERFUMATOR ALL RIGHT NEXT SO I BRUSH MY TEETH TWICE A DAY
JinsopLee_2013 AND WHAT IF WE HAD A TOOTHBRUSH THAT TASTES LIKE CANDY
JinsopLee_2013 IT 'S NOT JUST THE WAY THEY LOOK BUT I LOVE THE WAY THEY FEEL WHEN YOU PRESS DOWN ON THEM
JinsopLee_2013 NOW I DON 'T PLAY THE FLUTE OR THE CLARINET SO I DECIDED TO COMBINE THESE KEYS WITH AN INSTRUMENT I DO PLAY THE TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL
JinsopLee_2013 SO IN CONCLUSION
JinsopLee_2013 I 'VE FOUND THE FIVE SENSES THEORY TO BE A VERY USEFUL TOOL IN EVALUATING DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES IN MY LIFE AND THEN TAKING THOSE BEST EXPERIENCES AND HOPEFULLY INCORPORATING THEM INTO MY DESIGNS NOW I REALIZE THE FIVE SENSES ISN 'T THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES LIFE INTERESTING THERE 'S ALSO THE SIX EMOTIONS AND
JinsopLee_2013 THAT ELUSIVE X FACTOR
JinsopLee_2013 MAYBE THAT COULD BE THE TOPIC OF MY NEXT TALK
JinsopLee_2013 AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS WITH
