PeterHirschberg_2007P SO IT 'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THE COMPUTER AMBUSHED TELEVISION OR WHY THE INVENTION OF THE ATOMIC BOMB UNLEASHED FORCES THAT LEAD TO THE WRITERS STRIKE AND IT 'S NOT JUST WHAT THESE ARE DOING TO EACH OTHER BUT IT 'S WHAT THE AUDIENCE THINKS THAT REALLY FRAMES THIS MATTER
PeterHirschberg_2007P TO GET A SENSE OF THIS AND IT 'S BEEN A THEME WE 'VE TALKED ABOUT ALL WEEK I RECENTLY TALKED TO A BUNCH OF TWEENERS I WROTE ON CARDS TELEVISION RADIO MYSPACE INTERNET PC AND I SAID JUST ARRANGE THESE FROM WHAT 'S IMPORTANT TO YOU AND WHAT 'S NOT AND THEN TELL ME WHY
PeterHirschberg_2007P LET 'S LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY GET TO THE PORTION OF THE DISCUSSION ON TELEVISION
PeterHirschberg_2007P BUT LIKE NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE YOU CAN DO A LOT OF OTHER
PeterHirschberg_2007P FOLLOWED BY REACTIONS IN BOARDROOMS IN THE FINANCE COMMUNITY BEST CHARACTERIZED AS WHAT 'S THE FINANCE TERM
PeterHirschberg_2007P AND THE NEW YORK TIMES HERALDS THIS AS TELECOMMUNICATIONS MOVING TO THE HOME CONVERGENCE GREAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING EVERYBODY IN THE EAST COAST GETS IN THE PICTURES CITICORP PENNEY RCA ALL GETTING INTO THIS BIG VISION
PeterHirschberg_2007P AND THEN THE BOTTOM FALLS OUT DOESN 'T WORK OUT TOO WELL FOR THEM THEY LOSE MONEY AND
PeterHirschberg_2007P WARNER OF COURSE WRITES OFF MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
PeterHirschberg_2007P SHOWING THAT THEY 'D ACTUALLY MASTERED THE ART OF APPLYING MOORE 'S LAW OF SUCCESSIVE MINIATURIZATION TO THEIR BALANCE SHEET
PeterHirschberg_2007P YOU KNOW WHO ELSE TALKS THAT WAY AND THE ANSWER IS PRETTY CLEARLY IT 'S PEOPLE IN RELIGION
PeterHirschberg_2007P WE ACTUALLY GO BACK TO THE WELL AND START ALL OVER AGAIN AS THE PEOPLE IN NEW YORK AND L A LOOK ON IN ABSOLUTE MORBID ASTONISHMENT BUT IT 'S THIS IRRATIONAL VIEW OF THINGS THAT DRIVES US ON TO THE NEXT THING SO WHAT I 'D LIKE TO ASK IS IF THE COMPUTER IS BECOMING A PRINCIPAL TOOL OF MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT
PeterHirschberg_2007P A MACHINE THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A POTENTIAL MEDIA STAR SO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
PeterHirschberg_2007P THE FOREMOST JOURNALIST OF EARLY TELEVISION MEETS ONE OF THE FOREMOST COMPUTER PIONEERS AND THE COMPUTER BEGINS TO EXPRESS ITSELF
PeterHirschberg_2007P NOW AT THE STANDARD RATE OF FUEL CONSUMPTION
PeterHirschberg_2007P SAY AT THE END OF FORTY SECONDS THE AMOUNT OF FUEL REMAINING
PeterHirschberg_2007P IT WAS TOO PRICEY FOR THE NAVY AND ALL OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST IF IT WEREN 'T FOR A HAPPY COINCIDENCE ENTER THE ATOMIC BOMB
PeterHirschberg_2007P WE 'RE THREATENED BY THE GREATEST WEAPON EVER AND KNOWING A GOOD THING WHEN IT SEES IT THE AIR FORCE DECIDES IT NEEDS THE BIGGEST COMPUTER EVER TO PROTECT US
PeterHirschberg_2007P PROJECT BUILDING THE A BOMB IN THE FIRST PLACE TALK ABOUT A SHOT IN THE ARM FOR THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THE AIR FORCE BECAME A PRETTY GOOD SALESMAN HERE 'S THEIR MARKETING VIDEO
PeterHirschberg_2007P THIS NEW COMPUTER BUILT TO BECOME THE NERVE CENTER OF A DEFENSE NETWORK
PeterHirschberg_2007P IS ABLE TO PERFORM ALL THE COMPLEX MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN COUNTERING A MASS ENEMY RAID
PeterHirschberg_2007P IT IS PROVIDED WITH ITS OWN POWERHOUSE CONTAINING LARGE DIESEL DRIVEN GENERATORS
PeterHirschberg_2007P AIR CONDITIONING EQUIPMENT AND COOLING TOWERS REQUIRED TO COOL THE THOUSANDS OF VACUUM TUBES IN THE COMPUTER
PeterHirschberg_2007P IT ALSO USED VACUUM TUBES YOU SAW HOW HUGE IT WAS AND TO GIVE YOU A SENSE FOR THIS BECAUSE WE 'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT MOORE 'S LAW AND MAKING THINGS SMALL AT THIS CONFERENCE SO LET 'S TALK ABOUT MAKING THINGS LARGE
PeterHirschberg_2007P IF WE TOOK WHIRLWIND AND PUT IT IN A PLACE THAT YOU ALL KNOW SAY CENTURY CITY IT WOULD FIT BEAUTIFULLY YOU 'D KIND OF HAVE TO TAKE CENTURY CITY OUT BUT IT COULD FIT IN THERE
PeterHirschberg_2007P AND THEN THE NINETY TWO NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS THAT IT WOULD TAKE TO PROVIDE
PeterHirschberg_2007P KIND OF REDUCES ALL THIS AND MAKES THE FIRST MINI COMPUTER IT SHOWS UP AT PLACES LIKE MIT
PeterHirschberg_2007P AND THEN A MUTATION HAPPENS SPACEWAR IS BUILT THE FIRST COMPUTER GAME AND ALL OF A SUDDEN INTERACTIVITY AND INVOLVEMENT AND PASSION IS WORKED OUT ACTUALLY MANY MIT STUDENTS STAYED UP ALL NIGHT LONG WORKING ON THIS THING AND MANY OF THE PRINCIPLES OF GAMING TODAY WERE WORKED OUT DEC KNEW A GOOD THING ABOUT WASTING TIME
PeterHirschberg_2007P IT SHIPPED EVERY ONE OF ITS COMPUTERS WITH THAT GAME
PeterHirschberg_2007P MEANWHILE AS ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING BY THE MID FIFTY S THE BUSINESS MODEL OF TRADITIONAL BROADCASTING AND CINEMA HAS BEEN BUSTED COMPLETELY
PeterHirschberg_2007P AND A QUOTE THAT SOUNDS LARGELY REMINISCENT FROM EVERYTHING I 'VE BEEN READING ALL WEEK
PeterHirschberg_2007P AND THEY FAKE IT
PeterHirschberg_2007P TURNS OUT THEY TOLD US DIRECTLY THAT THESE ARE THE ONLY CRAYONS YOU SHOULD EVER USE WITH YOUR WINKY DINK MAGIC WINDOW OTHER CRAYONS MAY DISCOLOR OR HURT THE WINDOW THIS PROPRIETARY PRINCIPLE OF VENDOR LOCK IN
PeterHirschberg_2007P WOULD GO ON TO BE PERFECTED WITH GREAT SUCCESS AS ONE OF THE ENDURING PRINCIPLES OF WINDOWING SYSTEMS EVERYWHERE
PeterHirschberg_2007P IT LED TO LAWSUITS LAUGHTER FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS AND LOTS OF REPERCUSSIONS AND THAT 'S A SCANDAL WE WON 'T DISCUSS TODAY
PeterHirschberg_2007P BUT WE WILL DISCUSS THIS SCANDAL BECAUSE THIS MAN JACK BERRY THE HOST OF WINKY DINK WENT ON TO BECOME THE HOST OF TWENTY ONE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT QUIZ SHOWS EVER AND IT WAS RIGGED AND IT BECAME UNRAVELED WHEN THIS MAN
PeterHirschberg_2007P CHARLES VAN DOREN WAS OUTED AFTER AN UNNATURAL WINNING STREAK ENDING BERRY 'S CAREER AND ACTUALLY ENDING THE CAREER OF A LOT OF PEOPLE AT CBS IT TURNS OUT THERE WAS A LOT TO LEARN
PeterHirschberg_2007P ABOUT HOW THIS NEW MEDIUM WORKED
PeterHirschberg_2007P AND FIFTY YEARS AGO IF YOU 'D BEEN AT A MEETING LIKE THIS AND WERE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE MEDIA THERE WAS ONE PROPHET AND ONLY BUT ONE YOU WANTED TO HEAR FROM PROFESSOR MARSHALL MCLUHAN
PeterHirschberg_2007P YOU HAVE EXTREME CONCERN WITH EVERYBODY ELSE
PeterHirschberg_2007P DOESN 'T NECESSARILY MEAN HARMONY AND PEACE AND QUIET BUT IT DOES MEAN HUGE INVOLVEMENT
PeterHirschberg_2007P IN EVERYBODY ELSE 'S AFFAIRS AND SO THE GLOBAL VILLAGE IS AS BIG AS A PLANET AND AS SMALL AS A
PeterHirschberg_2007P AND DOUG ENGELBART A COMPUTER SCIENTIST AT SRI CHANGED THE WORLD ENGELBART CAME OUT OF A PRETTY DRY ENGINEERING CULTURE BUT WHILE HE WAS BEGINNING TO DO HIS WORK
PeterHirschberg_2007P ALL OF THIS STUFF WAS BUBBLING ON THE MID PENINSULA THERE WAS LSD LEAKING OUT OF KESEY 'S VETERANS HOSPITAL EXPERIMENTS
PeterHirschberg_2007P THIS WAS A REMARKABLE PLACE AT A REMARKABLE TIME AND INTO THAT FERMENT CAME THE MICROPROCESSOR I THINK IT WAS THAT INTERACTION THAT LED TO PERSONAL COMPUTING THEY SAW
PeterHirschberg_2007P THESE TOOLS THAT WERE CONTROLLED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT AS ONES THAT COULD ACTUALLY BE LIBERATED AND PUT TO USE BY THESE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO BUILD
PeterHirschberg_2007P AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY HAD THIS ETHOS OF SHARING INFORMATION I THINK THESE IDEAS ARE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WHEN YOU 'RE TRAPPED IN ONE PARADIGM THE NEXT PARADIGM IS ALWAYS LIKE
PeterHirschberg_2007P ANY KIND OF PICTURE OR PIECE OF TEXT OR DATA ACROSS A FILE SYSTEM AND WE HAD NO WAY OF EXPLAINING IT THERE WAS NO METAPHOR WAS IT A DATABASE A PROTOTYPING TOOL A SCRIPTED LANGUAGE HECK IT WAS EVERYTHING
PeterHirschberg_2007P SO WE ENDED UP WRITING A MARKETING BROCHURE WE ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT HOW THE MIND WORKS AND WE LET OUR CUSTOMERS PLAY THE ROLE OF SO MANY BLIND MEN FILLING OUT THE ELEPHANT
PeterHirschberg_2007P A FEW YEARS LATER WE THEN HIT ON THE IDEA OF EXPLAINING TO PEOPLE THE SECRET OF HOW DO YOU GET THE CONTENT YOU WANT THE WAY YOU WANT IT AND THE EASY WAY
PeterHirschberg_2007P HERE 'S THE APPLE MARKETING VIDEO
PeterHirschberg_2007P THE MOST INVOLVED METHOD IS TO GO AHEAD AND PRODUCE YOUR OWN VIDEODISC AS WELL AS BUILD YOUR OWN HYPERCARD STACKS BY FAR THE SIMPLEST METHOD IS TO BUY A PRE MADE VIDEODISC AND HYPERCARD STACKS FROM A COMMERCIAL SUPPLIER
PeterHirschberg_2007P THE METHOD WE ILLUSTRATE IN THIS VIDEO USES A PRE MADE VIDEODISC BUT CREATES CUSTOM HYPERCARD STACKS THIS METHOD ALLOWS YOU TO USE EXISTING VIDEODISC MATERIALS IN WAYS WHICH SUIT YOUR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND INTERESTS
PeterHirschberg_2007P PERSONAL MATTER BETWEEN THE COMPUTER AND THE FILE SYSTEM THAT 'S FINE BUT AS YOU CAN SEE IT WAS ABOUT TO LEAP OUT AND UPSET JACK VALENTI AND A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE
PeterHirschberg_2007P BY THE WAY SPEAKING OF THE FILING SYSTEM IT NEVER OCCURRED TO US THAT THESE HYPERLINKS COULD GO BEYOND THE LOCAL AREA NETWORK A FEW YEARS LATER TIM BERNERS LEE WORKED THAT OUT IT BECAME A KILLER APP OF LINKS AND TODAY OF COURSE WE CALL THAT THE WORLD WIDE WEB
PeterHirschberg_2007P NOW NOT ONLY WAS I INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING APPLE MISS THE INTERNET
PeterHirschberg_2007P LET US RECALL THE PIONEERS WHO MADE THIS TECHNICAL MARVEL POSSIBLE
PeterHirschberg_2007P THE DIGITAL HIGHWAY WOULD FOLLOW THE RUTTED TRAIL FIRST BLAZED BY ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL
PeterHirschberg_2007P THE
PeterHirschberg_2007P WE MISSED A LOT YOU KNOW YOU MISSED WE MISSED THE INTERNET THE LONG TAIL THE ROLE OF THE AUDIENCE OPEN SYSTEMS SOCIAL NETWORKS IT JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW TOUGH IT IS TO COME UP WITH THE RIGHT USES OF MEDIA THOMAS EDISON HAD THE SAME PROBLEM HE WROTE A LIST OF
PeterHirschberg_2007P WHAT THE PHONOGRAPH MIGHT BE GOOD FOR WHEN HE INVENTED IT AND KIND OF ONLY ONE OF HIS IDEAS TURNED OUT TO HAVE BEEN THE RIGHT EARLY IDEA WELL YOU KNOW WHERE WE 'RE GOING ON FROM HERE WE COME INTO THE ERA OF THE DOTCOM THE WORLD WIDE WEB AND I DON 'T NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE ALL WENT THROUGH THAT BUBBLE TOGETHER
PeterHirschberg_2007P BUT WHEN WE EMERGE FROM THIS AND WHAT WE CALL WEB TWO POINT ZERO THINGS ACTUALLY ARE QUITE DIFFERENT AND I THINK IT 'S THE REASON THAT TV 'S SO CHALLENGED IF INTERNET ONE WAS ABOUT PAGES NOW IT 'S ABOUT PEOPLE IT 'S A CUSTOMER IT 'S AN AUDIENCE IT 'S A PERSON WHO 'S PARTICIPATING IT 'S THE FORMIDABLE THING THAT IS CHANGING ENTERTAINMENT NOW
PeterHirschberg_2007P AND IT 'S NO WONDER THAT AS WE HEAD INTO THE WRITERS STRIKE ODD THINGS HAPPEN YOU KNOW IT REMINDS ME OF THAT OLD SAW IN HOLLYWOOD THAT A PRODUCER IS ANYONE WHO KNOWS A WRITER
PeterHirschberg_2007P I NOW THINK A NETWORK BOSS IS ANYONE WHO HAS A CABLE MODEM
PeterHirschberg_2007P COULD BENEFIT FROM LABOR DISPUTES MEANWHILE YOU HAVE THE TV BLOGGERS GOING OUT ON STRIKE IN SYMPATHY WITH THE TELEVISION WRITERS AND THEN YOU HAVE TV GUIDE A FOX PROPERTY WHICH IS ABOUT TO SPONSOR THE ONLINE VIDEO AWARDS BUT CANCELS IT OUT OF SYMPATHY WITH TRADITIONAL TELEVISION NOT APPEARING TO GLOAT
PeterHirschberg_2007P BUT THEN HE REMEMBERS HE WORKS FOR RUPERT MURDOCH
PeterHirschberg_2007P FOLLOWING TAKES PLACE BETWEEN THE MINUTES OF TWO FIFTEEN P M AND TWO EIGHTEEN P M IN THE MONTHS PRECEDING THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES
PeterHirschberg_2007P THEY 'RE PRODUCING THINGS FOR BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A MINUTE
PeterHirschberg_2007P AND THEY 'RE OFFERING THEIR CREATORS THIRTY PERCENT OF THE BACK END IN A MUCH MORE ENTREPRENEURIAL MANNER SO IT 'S A DIFFERENT MODEL
PeterHirschberg_2007P WHAT THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS IS STRUGGLING WITH THE WORLD OF BRANDS IS FIGURING OUT FOR EXAMPLE NIKE NOW UNDERSTANDS THAT NIKE PLUS IS NOT JUST A DEVICE IN ITS SHOE IT 'S A NETWORK TO HOOK ITS CUSTOMERS TOGETHER AND THE HEAD OF MARKETING AT NIKE SAYS PEOPLE ARE COMING TO OUR SITE AN AVERAGE OF THREE TIMES A WEEK WE DON 'T HAVE TO GO TO THEM
PeterHirschberg_2007P WHICH MEANS TELEVISION ADVERTISING IS DOWN FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT
PeterHirschberg_2007P AND MEDIA COMPANIES REALIZE THE AUDIENCE IS IMPORTANT ALSO HERE 'S A MAN ANNOUNCING THE NEW MARKET WATCH FROM DOW JONES POWERED ONE HUNDRED PERCENT BY THE USER EXPERIENCE ON THE HOME PAGE USER GENERATED CONTENT MARRIED UP WITH TRADITIONAL CONTENT IT TURNS OUT YOU HAVE A BIGGER AUDIENCE AND MORE INTEREST IF YOU HOOK UP WITH THEM OR AS GEOFFREY MOORE ONCE TOLD ME
PeterHirschberg_2007P IT 'S INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY THAT 'S THE TRADE THAT BRANDS NEED IN THE AGE OF THE BLOGOSPHERE AND I THINK THIS IS BEGINNING TO HAPPEN IN THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS ONE OF MY HEROES IS SONGWRITER ALLY WILLIS WHO JUST WROTE THE COLOR PURPLE AND HAS BEEN AN R AND RHYTHM AND BLUES WRITER AND THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID
PeterHirschberg_2007P BACK TO MARSHALL MCLUHAN WHO FORTY YEARS AGO WAS DEALING WITH AUDIENCES THAT WERE GOING THROUGH JUST AS MUCH CHANGE AND I THINK THAT TODAY TRADITIONAL HOLLYWOOD AND THE WRITERS ARE FRAMING THIS PERHAPS IN THE WAY THAT IT WAS BEING FRAMED BEFORE BUT I DON 'T NEED TO TELL YOU THIS LET 'S THROW IT BACK TO HIM
PeterHirschberg_2007P BECAUSE THE OLD MEDIUM IS ALWAYS THE CONTENT
PeterHirschberg_2007P AND WHEREAS TELEVISION MAY HAVE GOTTEN BEAT UP WHAT 'S GETTING BUILT IS A REALLY EXCITING NEW FORM OF COMMUNICATION AND
PeterHirschberg_2007P WE KIND OF HAVE THE MERGER OF THE TWO INDUSTRIES AND A NEW WAY OF THINKING TO LOOK AT IT THANKS VERY MUCH
