AndresLozano_2013X@9.09:12.81 THE
AndresLozano_2013X@18.52:34.36 SO I AM INDEED A NEUROSURGEON AND I FOLLOW A LONG TRADITION OF NEUROSURGERY AND WHAT I 'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT TODAY IS ADJUSTING THE DIALS IN THE CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN BEING ABLE TO GO ANYWHERE IN THE BRAIN AND TURNING AREAS OF THE BRAIN UP OR DOWN
AndresLozano_2013X@34.36:36.36 TO HELP OUR PATIENTS
AndresLozano_2013X@36.36:51.11 SO AS I SAID NEUROSURGERY COMES FROM A LONG TRADITION IT 'S BEEN AROUND FOR ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND YEARS IN MESOAMERICA THERE USED TO BE NEUROSURGERY AND THERE WERE THESE NEUROSURGEONS THAT USED TO TREAT PATIENTS
AndresLozano_2013X@51.11:70.58 AND THEY WERE TRYING TO THEY KNEW THAT THE BRAIN WAS INVOLVED IN NEUROLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE THEY DIDN 'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE DOING NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED BY THE WAY LAUGHTER BUT THEY THOUGHT THAT IF YOU HAD A NEUROLOGIC OR PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE IT MUST BE BECAUSE YOU ARE POSSESSED BY AN EVIL SPIRIT
AndresLozano_2013X@70.58:75.37 SO IF YOU ARE POSSESSED BY AN EVIL SPIRIT CAUSING NEUROLOGIC OR PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS
AndresLozano_2013X@75.37:83.1 THEN THE WAY TO TREAT THIS IS OF COURSE TO MAKE A HOLE IN YOUR SKULL AND LET THE EVIL SPIRIT ESCAPE
AndresLozano_2013X@83.1:89.85 SO THIS WAS THE THINKING BACK THEN AND THESE INDIVIDUALS MADE THESE HOLES SOMETIMES
AndresLozano_2013X@89.85:106.75 THE PATIENTS WERE A LITTLE BIT RELUCTANT TO GO THROUGH THIS BECAUSE YOU CAN TELL THAT THE HOLES ARE MADE PARTIALLY AND THEN I THINK THERE WAS SOME TREPANATION AND THEN THEY LEFT VERY QUICKLY AND IT WAS ONLY A PARTIAL HOLE AND WE KNOW THEY SURVIVED THESE PROCEDURES BUT THIS WAS COMMON THERE WERE SOME SITES WHERE ONE PERCENT OF ALL THE SKULLS
AndresLozano_2013X@113.21:115.74 ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO
AndresLozano_2013X@115.74:119.86 NOW IN THE COURSE OF TIME WE 'VE COME TO REALIZE THAT
AndresLozano_2013X@119.86:137.39 DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BRAIN DO DIFFERENT THINGS SO THERE ARE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE DEDICATED TO CONTROLLING YOUR MOVEMENT OR YOUR VISION OR YOUR MEMORY OR YOUR APPETITE AND SO ON AND WHEN THINGS WORK WELL THEN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS WELL AND EVERYTHING FUNCTIONS BUT ONCE IN A WHILE THINGS DON 'T GO SO WELL AND THERE 'S TROUBLE
AndresLozano_2013X@137.39:141.29 IN THESE CIRCUITS AND THERE ARE SOME ROGUE NEURONS THAT ARE MISFIRING
AndresLozano_2013X@141.29:146.92 AND CAUSING TROUBLE OR SOMETIMES THEY 'RE UNDERACTIVE AND THEY 'RE NOT QUITE WORKING AS THEY SHOULD
AndresLozano_2013X@146.92:158.35 NOW THE MANIFESTATION OF THIS DEPENDS ON WHERE IN THE BRAIN THESE NEURONS ARE SO WHEN THESE NEURONS ARE IN THE MOTOR CIRCUIT YOU GET DYSFUNCTION IN THE MOVEMENT SYSTEM AND YOU GET THINGS LIKE PARKINSON 'S DISEASE
AndresLozano_2013X@158.35:170.53 WHEN THE MALFUNCTION IS IN A CIRCUIT THAT REGULATES YOUR MOOD YOU GET THINGS LIKE DEPRESSION AND WHEN IT IS IN A CIRCUIT THAT CONTROLS YOUR MEMORY AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION THEN YOU GET THINGS LIKE ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE
AndresLozano_2013X@170.53:175.51 SO WHAT WE 'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO IS TO PINPOINT WHERE THESE DISTURBANCES ARE IN THE BRAIN
AndresLozano_2013X@175.51:180.93 AND WE 'VE BEEN ABLE TO INTERVENE WITHIN THESE CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN TO EITHER TURN THEM UP
AndresLozano_2013X@180.93:195.95 OR TURN THEM DOWN SO THIS IS VERY MUCH LIKE CHOOSING THE CORRECT STATION ON THE RADIO DIAL ONCE YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHT STATION WHETHER IT BE JAZZ OR OPERA IN OUR CASE WHETHER IT BE MOVEMENT OR MOOD WE CAN PUT THE DIAL THERE AND THEN WE CAN USE A SECOND BUTTON TO ADJUST THE VOLUME
AndresLozano_2013X@195.95:200.54 TO TURN IT UP OR TURN IT DOWN SO WHAT I 'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT IS USING
AndresLozano_2013X@200.54:207.37 THE CIRCUITRY OF THE BRAIN TO IMPLANT ELECTRODES AND TURNING AREAS OF THE BRAIN UP AND DOWN TO SEE IF WE CAN HELP OUR PATIENTS
AndresLozano_2013X@207.37:225.92 AND THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED USING THIS KIND OF DEVICE AND THIS IS CALLED DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION SO WHAT WE 'RE DOING IS PLACING THESE ELECTRODES THROUGHOUT THE BRAIN AGAIN WE ARE MAKING HOLES IN THE SKULL ABOUT THE SIZE OF A DIME PUTTING AN ELECTRODE IN AND THEN THIS ELECTRODE IS COMPLETELY UNDERNEATH THE SKIN DOWN TO A PACEMAKER IN THE CHEST
AndresLozano_2013X@225.92:237.88 AND WITH A REMOTE CONTROL VERY MUCH LIKE A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL WE CAN ADJUST HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY WE DELIVER TO THESE AREAS OF THE BRAIN WE CAN TURN IT UP OR DOWN ON OR OFF
AndresLozano_2013X@237.88:250.29 NOW ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS IN THE WORLD HAVE RECEIVED DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION AND I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF USING DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION TO TREAT DISORDERS OF MOVEMENT DISORDERS OF MOOD AND DISORDERS OF COGNITION
AndresLozano_2013X@250.59:265.94 SO THIS LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHEN IT 'S IN THE BRAIN YOU SEE THE ELECTRODE GOING THROUGH THE SKULL INTO THE BRAIN AND RESTING THERE AND WE CAN PLACE THIS REALLY ANYWHERE IN THE BRAIN I TELL MY FRIENDS THAT NO NEURON IS SAFE FROM A NEUROSURGEON BECAUSE WE CAN REALLY REACH JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE IN THE BRAIN QUITE SAFELY NOW
AndresLozano_2013X@266.46:281.4 NOW THE FIRST EXAMPLE I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IS A PATIENT WITH PARKINSON 'S DISEASE AND THIS LADY HAS PARKINSON 'S DISEASE AND SHE HAS THESE ELECTRODES IN HER BRAIN AND I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT SHE 'S LIKE WHEN THE ELECTRODES ARE TURNED OFF AND SHE HAS HER PARKINSON 'S SYMPTOMS AND THEN WE 'RE GOING TO TURN IT ON
AndresLozano_2013X@282.08:283.96 SO THIS LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
AndresLozano_2013X@300.41:303.51 IT 'S ON
AndresLozano_2013X@309.65:312.57 AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHAKING IN THIS WAY AND NOT
AndresLozano_2013X@325.29:338.79 SO WE NOW KNOW HOW TO FIND THESE TROUBLEMAKERS AND TELL THEM GENTLEMEN THAT 'S ENOUGH WE WANT YOU TO STOP DOING THAT AND WE DO THAT WITH ELECTRICITY SO WE USE ELECTRICITY TO DICTATE HOW THEY FIRE AND WE TRY TO BLOCK THEIR MISBEHAVIOR USING ELECTRICITY
AndresLozano_2013X@338.79:348.92 SO IN THIS CASE WE ARE SUPPRESSING THE ACTIVITY OF ABNORMAL NEURONS WE STARTED USING THIS TECHNIQUE IN OTHER PROBLEMS AND I 'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT A FASCINATING PROBLEM THAT WE ENCOUNTERED A CASE OF DYSTONIA
AndresLozano_2013X@349.15:361.65 SO DYSTONIA IS A DISORDER AFFECTING CHILDREN IT 'S A GENETIC DISORDER AND IT INVOLVES A TWISTING MOTION AND THESE CHILDREN GET PROGRESSIVELY MORE AND MORE TWISTING UNTIL THEY CAN 'T BREATHE UNTIL THEY GET SORES URINARY INFECTIONS AND THEN THEY DIE
AndresLozano_2013X@361.65:372.4 SO BACK IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN I WAS ASKED TO SEE THIS YOUNG BOY PERFECTLY NORMAL HE HAS THIS GENETIC FORM OF DYSTONIA THERE ARE EIGHT CHILDREN IN THE FAMILY FIVE OF THEM HAVE DYSTONIA
AndresLozano_2013X@397.71:405.88 AND INDEED THE NATURAL PROGRESSION AS THIS GETS WORSE IS FOR THEM TO BECOME PROGRESSIVELY TWISTED PROGRESSIVELY DISABLED AND MANY OF THESE CHILDREN DO NOT SURVIVE
AndresLozano_2013X@408.77:414.35 SO HE IS ONE OF FIVE KIDS THE ONLY WAY HE COULD GET AROUND WAS CRAWLING ON HIS BELLY LIKE THIS
AndresLozano_2013X@414.75:422.44 HE DID NOT RESPOND TO ANY DRUGS WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS BOY WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT OPERATION TO DO WHERE TO GO IN THE BRAIN
AndresLozano_2013X@439.53:441.4 SO HERE HE IS NOW
AndresLozano_2013X@441.54:446.54 BACK IN ISRAEL WHERE HE LIVES THREE MONTHS AFTER THE PROCEDURE AND HERE HE IS
AndresLozano_2013X@465.72:477.44 THIS BOY IS NOW IN UNIVERSITY AND LEADS QUITE A NORMAL LIFE THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST SATISFYING CASES THAT I HAVE EVER DONE IN MY ENTIRE CAREER TO RESTORE MOVEMENT AND WALKING TO THIS KIND OF
AndresLozano_2013X@484.35:494.49 WE REALIZED THAT PERHAPS WE COULD USE THIS TECHNOLOGY NOT ONLY IN CIRCUITS THAT CONTROL YOUR MOVEMENT BUT ALSO CIRCUITS THAT CONTROL OTHER THINGS AND THE NEXT THING THAT WE TOOK ON WAS CIRCUITS THAT CONTROL YOUR MOOD
AndresLozano_2013X@518:531.04 SO THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS WE COMPARED WHAT 'S DIFFERENT IN THE BRAIN OF SOMEONE WITH DEPRESSION AND SOMEONE WHO IS NORMAL AND WHAT WE DID WAS PET SCANS TO LOOK AT THE BLOOD FLOW OF THE BRAIN AND WHAT WE NOTICED IS THAT IN PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION COMPARED TO NORMALS
AndresLozano_2013X@531.04:547.49 AREAS OF THE BRAIN ARE SHUT DOWN AND THOSE ARE THE AREAS IN BLUE SO HERE YOU REALLY HAVE THE BLUES AND THE AREAS IN BLUE ARE AREAS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN MOTIVATION IN DRIVE AND DECISION MAKING AND INDEED IF YOU 'RE SEVERELY DEPRESSED AS THESE PATIENTS WERE THOSE ARE IMPAIRED YOU LACK MOTIVATION AND DRIVE
AndresLozano_2013X@547.49:565.34 THE OTHER THING WE DISCOVERED WAS AN AREA THAT WAS OVERACTIVE AREA TWENTY FIVE SEEN THERE IN RED AND AREA TWENTY FIVE IS THE SADNESS CENTER OF THE BRAIN IF I MAKE ANY OF YOU SAD FOR EXAMPLE I MAKE YOU REMEMBER THE LAST TIME YOU SAW YOUR PARENT BEFORE THEY DIED OR A FRIEND BEFORE THEY DIED THIS AREA OF THE BRAIN LIGHTS UP IT IS THE SADNESS CENTER OF THE BRAIN
AndresLozano_2013X@565.34:573.24 AND SO PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION HAVE HYPERACTIVITY THE AREA OF THE BRAIN FOR SADNESS IS ON RED HOT THE THERMOSTAT IS SET AT ONE HUNDRED DEGREES
AndresLozano_2013X@573.24:585.48 AND THE OTHER AREAS OF THE BRAIN INVOLVED IN DRIVE AND MOTIVATION ARE SHUT DOWN SO WE WONDERED CAN WE PLACE ELECTRODES IN THIS AREA OF SADNESS AND SEE IF WE CAN TURN DOWN THE THERMOSTAT CAN WE TURN DOWN THE ACTIVITY AND WHAT WILL BE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT
AndresLozano_2013X@585.7:591.67 SO WE WENT AHEAD AND IMPLANTED ELECTRODES IN PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION THIS IS WORK DONE WITH MY COLLEAGUE HELEN MAYBERG FROM EMORY
AndresLozano_2013X@591.67:610.02 AND WE PLACED ELECTRODES IN AREA TWENTY FIVE AND IN THE TOP SCAN YOU SEE BEFORE THE OPERATION AREA TWENTY FIVE THE SADNESS AREA IS RED HOT AND THE FRONTAL LOBES ARE SHUT DOWN IN BLUE AND THEN AFTER THREE MONTHS OF CONTINUOUS STIMULATION TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY OR SIX MONTHS OF CONTINUOUS STIMULATION WE HAVE A COMPLETE REVERSAL OF THIS WE 'RE ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN AREA TWENTY FIVE
AndresLozano_2013X@610.02:619.52 DOWN TO A MORE NORMAL LEVEL AND WE 'RE ABLE TO TURN BACK ONLINE THE FRONTAL LOBES OF THE BRAIN AND INDEED WE 'RE SEEING VERY STRIKING RESULTS IN THESE PATIENTS WITH SEVERE DEPRESSION
AndresLozano_2013X@619.75:629.58 SO NOW WE ARE IN CLINICAL TRIALS AND ARE IN PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS AND THIS MAY BECOME A NEW PROCEDURE IF IT 'S SAFE AND WE FIND THAT IT 'S EFFECTIVE TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE DEPRESSION
AndresLozano_2013X@675.42:688.39 WE 'RE GOING TO DO THIS IN PEOPLE THAT HAVE COGNITIVE DEFICITS AND WE 'VE CHOSEN TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE WHO HAVE COGNITIVE AND MEMORY DEFICITS AS YOU KNOW THIS IS THE MAIN SYMPTOM OF EARLY ONSET ALZHEIMER 'S
AndresLozano_2013X@706.91:723.68 THERE 'S A HUGE DEFICIT IN GLUCOSE UTILIZATION IN THE BRAIN THE BRAIN IS A BIT OF A HOG WHEN IT COMES TO USING GLUCOSE IT USES TWENTY PERCENT OF ALL YOUR EVEN THOUGH IT ONLY WEIGHS TWO PERCENT IT USES TEN TIMES MORE GLUCOSE THAN IT SHOULD BASED ON ITS WEIGHT TWENTY PERCENT OF ALL THE GLUCOSE IN YOUR BODY IS USED BY THE BRAIN
AndresLozano_2013X@723.68:735.38 AND AS YOU GO FROM BEING NORMAL TO HAVING MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT WHICH IS A PRECURSOR FOR ALZHEIMER 'S ALL THE WAY TO ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE THEN THERE ARE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT STOP USING GLUCOSE THEY SHUT DOWN THEY TURN OFF
AndresLozano_2013X@735.54:744.14 AND INDEED WHAT WE SEE IS THAT THESE AREAS IN RED AROUND THE OUTSIDE RIBBON OF THE BRAIN ARE PROGRESSIVELY GETTING MORE AND MORE BLUE UNTIL THEY SHUT DOWN COMPLETELY
AndresLozano_2013X@744.85:754.84 THIS IS ANALOGOUS TO HAVING A POWER FAILURE IN AN AREA OF THE BRAIN A REGIONAL POWER FAILURE SO THE LIGHTS ARE OUT IN PARTS OF THE BRAIN IN PATIENTS WITH ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE
AndresLozano_2013X@754.84:766.37 AND THE QUESTION IS ARE THE LIGHTS OUT FOREVER OR CAN WE TURN THE LIGHTS BACK ON CAN WE GET THOSE AREAS OF THE BRAIN TO USE GLUCOSE ONCE AGAIN SO THIS IS WHAT WE DID WE IMPLANTED ELECTRODES IN THE FORNIX
AndresLozano_2013X@766.37:785.06 OF PATIENTS WITH ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE WE TURNED IT ON AND WE LOOKED AT WHAT HAPPENS TO GLUCOSE USE IN THE BRAIN AND INDEED AT THE TOP YOU 'LL SEE BEFORE THE SURGERY THE AREAS IN BLUE ARE THE AREAS THAT USE LESS GLUCOSE THAN NORMAL PREDOMINANTLY THE PARIETAL AND TEMPORAL LOBES THESE AREAS OF THE BRAIN ARE SHUT DOWN THE LIGHTS ARE OUT IN THESE AREAS OF THE BRAIN
AndresLozano_2013X@785.06:798.45 WE THEN PUT IN THE DBS ELECTRODES AND WE WAIT FOR A MONTH OR A YEAR AND THE AREAS IN RED REPRESENT THE AREAS WHERE WE INCREASE GLUCOSE UTILIZATION AND INDEED WE ARE ABLE TO GET THESE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT WERE NOT USING GLUCOSE TO USE GLUCOSE ONCE AGAIN
AndresLozano_2013X@798.45:810.24 SO THE MESSAGE HERE IS THAT IN ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE THE LIGHTS ARE OUT BUT THERE IS SOMEONE HOME AND WE 'RE ABLE TO TURN THE POWER BACK ON TO THESE AREAS OF THE BRAIN AND AS WE DO SO WE EXPECT THAT THEIR FUNCTIONS WILL RETURN
AndresLozano_2013X@810.27:821.32 SO THIS IS NOW IN CLINICAL TRIALS WE ARE GOING TO OPERATE ON FIFTY PATIENTS WITH EARLY ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE TO SEE WHETHER THIS IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE WHETHER WE CAN IMPROVE THEIR NEUROLOGIC FUNCTION
AndresLozano_2013X@829.45:843.24 SO THE MESSAGE I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH TODAY IS THAT INDEED THERE ARE SEVERAL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN THAT ARE MALFUNCTIONING ACROSS VARIOUS DISEASE STATES WHETHER WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT PARKINSON 'S DISEASE DEPRESSION SCHIZOPHRENIA
AndresLozano_2013X@843.24:861.05 ALZHEIMER 'S WE ARE NOW LEARNING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE CIRCUITS WHAT ARE THE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CLINICAL SIGNS AND THE SYMPTOMS OF THOSE DISEASES WE CAN NOW REACH THOSE CIRCUITS WE CAN INTRODUCE ELECTRODES WITHIN THOSE CIRCUITS WE CAN GRADUATE THE ACTIVITY OF THOSE CIRCUITS WE CAN TURN THEM
AndresLozano_2013X@861.05:873.26 DOWN IF THEY ARE OVERACTIVE IF THEY 'RE CAUSING TROUBLE TROUBLE THAT IS FELT THROUGHOUT THE BRAIN OR WE CAN TURN THEM UP IF THEY ARE UNDERPERFORMING AND IN SO DOING WE THINK THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP THE OVERALL FUNCTION OF THE BRAIN
AndresLozano_2013X@873.26:892.17 THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS OF COURSE IS THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO MODIFY THE SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE BUT I HAVEN 'T TOLD YOU BUT THERE 'S ALSO SOME EVIDENCE THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP THE REPAIR OF DAMAGED AREAS OF THE BRAIN USING ELECTRICITY AND THIS IS SOMETHING FOR THE FUTURE TO SEE IF INDEED WE NOT ONLY CHANGE THE ACTIVITY BUT ALSO SOME OF THE REPARATIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE BRAIN CAN BE HARVESTED
AndresLozano_2013X@892.17:900.98 SO I ENVISION THAT WE 'RE GOING TO SEE A GREAT EXPANSION OF INDICATIONS OF THIS TECHNIQUE WE 'RE GOING TO SEE ELECTRODES BEING PLACED FOR MANY DISORDERS OF THE BRAIN
AndresLozano_2013X@900.98:913.34 ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING THINGS ABOUT THIS IS THAT INDEED IT INVOLVES MULTIDISCIPLINARY WORK IT INVOLVES THE WORK OF ENGINEERS OF IMAGING SCIENTISTS OF BASIC SCIENTISTS OF NEUROLOGISTS PSYCHIATRISTS NEUROSURGEONS AND CERTAINLY AT THE INTERFACE
AndresLozano_2013X@913.34:917.41 OF THESE MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES THAT THERE 'S THE EXCITEMENT AND I THINK THAT
