KirbyFerguson_2012G@27.69:36.13 BUT THERE 'S A SMALL MINORITY OF DISSENTERS AND THEY CLAIM THAT BOB DYLAN IS STEALING OTHER PEOPLE 'S SONGS
KirbyFerguson_2012G@36.13:40.62 TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR BRIAN BURTON AKA DANGER MOUSE
KirbyFerguson_2012G@40.62:57.26 TAKES THE BEATLES WHITE ALBUM COMBINES IT WITH JAY Z 'S THE BLACK ALBUM TO CREATE THE GREY ALBUM THE GREY ALBUM BECOMES AN IMMEDIATE SENSATION ONLINE AND THE BEATLES RECORD COMPANY SENDS OUT COUNTLESS CEASE AND DESIST LETTERS FOR UNFAIR COMPETITION AND DILUTION OF OUR VALUABLE PROPERTY
KirbyFerguson_2012G@57.26:67.61 NOW THE GREY ALBUM IS A REMIX IT IS NEW MEDIA CREATED FROM OLD MEDIA IT WAS MADE USING THESE THREE TECHNIQUES COPY TRANSFORM AND COMBINE
KirbyFerguson_2012G@67.65:78.06 IT 'S HOW YOU REMIX YOU TAKE EXISTING SONGS YOU CHOP THEM UP YOU TRANSFORM THE PIECES YOU COMBINE THEM BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AND YOU 'VE GOT A NEW SONG BUT THAT NEW SONG IS CLEARLY COMPRISED OF OLD SONGS
KirbyFerguson_2012G@78.06:91.83 BUT I THINK THESE AREN 'T JUST THE COMPONENTS OF REMIXING I THINK THESE ARE THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF ALL CREATIVITY I THINK EVERYTHING IS A REMIX AND I THINK THIS IS A BETTER WAY TO CONCEIVE OF CREATIVITY
KirbyFerguson_2012G@162.57:164.23 THING
KirbyFerguson_2012G@271.58:281.03 LIKE ALL FOLK SINGERS HE COPIED MELODIES HE TRANSFORMED THEM HE COMBINED THEM WITH NEW LYRICS WHICH WERE FREQUENTLY THEIR OWN CONCOCTION OF PREVIOUS STUFF
KirbyFerguson_2012G@281.03:298.75 NOW AMERICAN COPYRIGHT AND PATENT LAWS RUN COUNTER TO THIS NOTION THAT WE BUILD ON THE WORK OF OTHERS INSTEAD THESE LAWS AND LAWS AROUND THE WORLD USE THE RATHER AWKWARD ANALOGY OF PROPERTY NOW CREATIVE WORKS MAY INDEED BE KIND OF LIKE PROPERTY BUT IT 'S PROPERTY THAT WE 'RE ALL BUILDING ON
KirbyFerguson_2012G@317.47:320.22 TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
KirbyFerguson_2012G@342.99:345.74 YOU CAN DO MULTI FINGERED GESTURES ON IT
KirbyFerguson_2012G@346.29:348.08 AND BOY HAVE WE PATENTED IT
KirbyFerguson_2012G@350.9:363.16 AND YET HERE IS MULTI TOUCH IN ACTION THIS IS AT TED ACTUALLY ABOUT A YEAR EARLIER THIS IS JEFF HAN AND I MEAN THAT 'S MULTI TOUCH IT 'S THE SAME ANIMAL AT LEAST LET 'S HEAR WHAT JEFF HAN HAS TO SAY ABOUT THIS NEWFANGLED TECHNOLOGY
KirbyFerguson_2012G@393.14:401.77 THAT IS ALL THERE IS TO IT APPLE HAS PATENTED THIS IT 'S A TWENTY EIGHT PAGE SOFTWARE PATENT BUT I WILL SUMMARIZE WHAT IT COVERS SPOILER
KirbyFerguson_2012G@435.18:443.49 NOW THIS IDEA THAT EVERYTHING IS A REMIX MIGHT SOUND LIKE COMMON SENSE UNTIL YOU 'RE THE ONE GETTING REMIXED FOR EXAMPLE
KirbyFerguson_2012G@448.77:454.24 AND WE HAVE YOU KNOW ALWAYS BEEN SHAMELESS ABOUT STEALING GREAT IDEAS
KirbyFerguson_2012G@470.68:482.11 NOW BEHAVIORAL ECONOMISTS MIGHT REFER TO THIS SORT OF THING AS LOSS AVERSION WE HAVE A STRONG PREDISPOSITION TOWARDS PROTECTING WHAT WE FEEL IS OURS WE HAVE NO SUCH AVERSION TOWARDS COPYING WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BECAUSE WE DO THAT NONSTOP
KirbyFerguson_2012G@538.49:547.21 I THINK THIS IS MOSTLY WHAT WE DO OUR CREATIVITY COMES FROM WITHOUT NOT FROM WITHIN WE ARE NOT SELF MADE WE ARE DEPENDENT ON ONE ANOTHER
KirbyFerguson_2012G@547.21:559.55 AND ADMITTING THIS TO OURSELVES ISN 'T AN EMBRACE OF MEDIOCRITY AND DERIVATIVENESS IT 'S A LIBERATION FROM OUR MISCONCEPTIONS AND IT 'S AN INCENTIVE TO NOT EXPECT SO MUCH FROM OURSELVES AND TO SIMPLY
