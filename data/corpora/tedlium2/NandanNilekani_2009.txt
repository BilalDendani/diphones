NandanNilekani_2009@17.06:26.66 INDIA THROUGH THE EVOLUTION OF IDEAS NOW I BELIEVE THIS IS AN INTERESTING WAY OF LOOKING AT IT BECAUSE IN EVERY SOCIETY ESPECIALLY AN OPEN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY
NandanNilekani_2009@43.55:54.10 THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WE HAD THE REAGAN REVOLUTION WHICH LEAD TO DEREGULATION AND TODAY AFTER THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS THERE WAS A WHOLE NEW SET OF RULES ABOUT HOW THE STATE SHOULD INTERVENE SO
NandanNilekani_2009@55.65:63.32 AND I LOOKED AT INDIA AND SAID REALLY THERE ARE FOUR KINDS OF IDEAS WHICH REALLY MAKE AN IMPACT ON INDIA THE FIRST TO MY MIND
NandanNilekani_2009@63.58:71.88 IS WHAT I CALL AS THE IDEAS THAT HAVE ARRIVED THESE IDEAS HAVE BROUGHT TOGETHER SOMETHING WHICH HAS MADE INDIA HAPPEN THE WAY IT IS TODAY
NandanNilekani_2009@72.15:79.22 THE SECOND SET OF IDEAS I CALL IDEAS IN PROGRESS THOSE ARE IDEAS WHICH HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BUT NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
NandanNilekani_2009@88.81:95.73 AND THE FOURTH THING WHICH I BELIEVE IS MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS THAT WE NEED TO ANTICIPATE BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE A DEVELOPING COUNTRY
NandanNilekani_2009@95.96:104.56 IN THE WORLD WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE PROBLEMS THAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE HAVING YOU CAN ACTUALLY ANTICIPATE WHAT THAT DID AND DO THINGS VERY DIFFERENTLY
NandanNilekani_2009@104.89:113.54 NOW IN INDIA 'S CASE I BELIEVE THERE ARE SIX IDEAS WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHERE IT HAS COME TODAY THE FIRST IS REALLY THE NOTION OF PEOPLE
NandanNilekani_2009@113.99:122.11 IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES WE THOUGHT OF PEOPLE AS A BURDEN WE THOUGHT OF PEOPLE AS A LIABILITY TODAY WE TALK OF PEOPLE AS
NandanNilekani_2009@130.35:141.67 HUMAN CAPITAL HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE INDIAN MINDSET AND THIS CHANGE IN THINKING OF HUMAN CAPITAL IS LINKED TO THE FACT THAT INDIA IS GOING THROUGH A DEMOGRAPHIC DIVIDEND
NandanNilekani_2009@142.13:154.76 AS HEALTHCARE IMPROVES AS INFANT MORTALITY GOES DOWN FERTILITY RATES START DROPPING AND INDIA IS EXPERIENCING THAT INDIA IS GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WITH A DEMOGRAPHIC DIVIDEND FOR THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS
NandanNilekani_2009@155.45:163.07 WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS DEMOGRAPHIC DIVIDEND IS THAT INDIA WILL BE THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TO HAVE THIS DEMOGRAPHIC DIVIDEND IN OTHER WORDS
NandanNilekani_2009@182.88:192.29 THE FERTILITY RATE IS ALMOST EQUAL TO THAT OF A WEST EUROPEAN COUNTRY THEN THERE IS THE WHOLE NORTHERN INDIA WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE BULK OF THE FUTURE DEMOGRAPHIC DIVIDEND
NandanNilekani_2009@192.64:200.50 BUT A DEMOGRAPHIC DIVIDEND IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE INVESTMENT IN YOUR HUMAN CAPITAL ONLY IF THE PEOPLE HAVE EDUCATION
NandanNilekani_2009@200.68:212.01 THEY HAVE GOOD HEALTH THEY HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE THEY HAVE ROADS TO GO TO WORK THEY HAVE LIGHTS TO STUDY AT NIGHT ONLY IN THOSE CASES CAN YOU REALLY GET THE BENEFIT OF A DEMOGRAPHIC DIVIDEND IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU DON'T REALLY INVEST
NandanNilekani_2009@212.37:225.21 IN THE HUMAN CAPITAL THE SAME DEMOGRAPHIC DIVIDEND CAN BE A DEMOGRAPHIC DISASTER THEREFORE INDIA IS AT A CRITICAL POINT WHERE EITHER IT CAN LEVERAGE ITS DEMOGRAPHIC DIVIDEND OR IT CAN LEAD TO A DEMOGRAPHIC DISASTER
NandanNilekani_2009@225.59:234.98 THE SECOND THING IN INDIA HAS BEEN THE CHANGE IN THE ROLE OF ENTREPRENEURS WHEN INDIA GOT INDEPENDENCE ENTREPRENEURS WERE SEEN AS A BAD LOT AS PEOPLE WHO WOULD EXPLOIT
NandanNilekani_2009@235.29:248.93 BUT TODAY AFTER SIXTY YEARS BECAUSE OF THE RISE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP ENTREPRENEURS HAVE BECOME ROLE MODELS AND THEY ARE CONTRIBUTING HUGELY TO THE SOCIETY THIS EXCHANGE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE VITALITY AND THE WHOLE ECONOMY
NandanNilekani_2009@249.27:257.81 THE THIRD BIG THING I BELIEVE THAT HAS CHANGED INDIA IS OUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ENGLISH LANGUAGE WAS SEEN AS A LANGUAGE OF THE IMPERIALISTS
NandanNilekani_2009@258.06:270.71 BUT TODAY WITH GLOBALIZATION WITH OUTSOURCING ENGLISH HAS BECOME A LANGUAGE OF ASPIRATION THIS HAS MADE IT SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO LEARN AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE ENGLISH IS NOW BECOMING A HUGE STRATEGIC ASSET
NandanNilekani_2009@271.08:281.29 THE NEXT THING IS TECHNOLOGY FORTY YEARS BACK COMPUTERS WERE SEEN AS SOMETHING WHICH WAS FORBIDDING SOMETHING WHICH WAS INTIMIDATING SOMETHING THAT REDUCED JOBS
NandanNilekani_2009@295.58:303.26 ARE RECHARGED AT LESS THAN TWENTY CENTS AT EACH RECHARGE THAT IS THE SCALE AT WHICH TECHNOLOGY HAS LIBERATED
NandanNilekani_2009@303.52:310.76 AND MADE IT ACCESSIBLE AND THEREFORE TECHNOLOGY HAS GONE FROM BEING SEEN AS SOMETHING FORBIDDING AND INTIMIDATING TO SOMETHING
NandanNilekani_2009@323.08:332.26 THE UNIONS TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY COMPUTERS AND WHEN THEY WANTED TO HAVE MORE ADVANCED MORE POWERFUL COMPUTERS THEY CALLED THEM ADVANCED LEDGER POSTING MACHINES
NandanNilekani_2009@332.61:341.45 SO WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY FROM THOSE DAYS WHERE THE TELEPHONE HAS BECOME AN INSTRUMENT OF EMPOWERMENT AND REALLY HAS CHANGED THE WAY INDIANS THINK OF TECHNOLOGY
NandanNilekani_2009@341.93:354.84 AND THEN I THINK THE OTHER POINT IS THAT INDIANS TODAY ARE FAR MORE COMFORTABLE WITH GLOBALIZATION AGAIN AFTER HAVING LIVED FOR MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS UNDER THE EAST INDIA COMPANY AND UNDER IMPERIAL RULE
NandanNilekani_2009@383.74:393.08 WHEN DEMOCRACY CAME TO INDIA SIXTY YEARS BACK IT WAS AN ELITE CONCEPT IT WAS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO BRING IN DEMOCRACY BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO BRING IN THE IDEA OF
NandanNilekani_2009@394.63:401.70 AND PARLIAMENT AND CONSTITUTION AND SO FORTH BUT TODAY DEMOCRACY HAS BECOME A BOTTOM UP PROCESS WHERE EVERYBODY HAS REALIZED
NandanNilekani_2009@401.86:410.16 THE BENEFITS OF HAVING A VOICE THE BENEFITS OF BEING IN AN OPEN SOCIETY AND THEREFORE DEMOCRACY HAS BECOME EMBEDDED I BELIEVE THESE SIX FACTORS
NandanNilekani_2009@410.47:419.77 THE RISE OF THE NOTION OF POPULATION AS HUMAN CAPITAL THE RISE OF INDIAN ENTREPRENEURS THE RISE OF ENGLISH AS A LANGUAGE OF ASPIRATION TECHNOLOGY AS SOMETHING EMPOWERING
NandanNilekani_2009@429.02:439.89 BUT HAVING SAID THAT THEN WE COME TO WHAT I CALL AS IDEAS IN PROGRESS THOSE ARE THE IDEAS WHERE THERE IS NO ARGUMENT IN A SOCIETY BUT YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THOSE THINGS AND REALLY THERE ARE FOUR THINGS HERE
NandanNilekani_2009@440.21:447.33 ONE IS THE QUESTION OF EDUCATION FOR SOME REASON WHATEVER REASON LACK OF MONEY LACK OF PRIORITIES BECAUSE OF RELIGION
NandanNilekani_2009@458.49:471.25 SO CHILDREN ARE GOING TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS TODAY EVEN IN THE SLUMS OF INDIA MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF URBAN KIDS ARE GOING INTO PRIVATE SCHOOLS SO THERE IS A BIG CHALLENGE IN GETTING THE SCHOOLS TO WORK BUT HAVING SAID THAT THERE IS AN ENORMOUS DESIRE
NandanNilekani_2009@471.61:480.53 AMONG EVERYBODY INCLUDING THE POOR TO EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN SO I BELIEVE PRIMARY EDUCATION IS AN IDEA WHICH IS ARRIVED BUT NOT YET IMPLEMENTED SIMILARLY INFRASTRUCTURE
NandanNilekani_2009@480.79:490.37 FOR A LONG TIME INFRASTRUCTURE WAS NOT A PRIORITY THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN TO INDIA HAVE SEEN THAT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT LIKE CHINA BUT TODAY I BELIEVE FINALLY INFRASTRUCTURE IS SOMETHING WHICH IS
NandanNilekani_2009@491.08:498.24 UPON AND WHICH PEOPLE WANT TO IMPLEMENT IT IS REFLECTED IN THE POLITICAL STATEMENTS TWENTY YEARS BACK THE POLITICAL SLOGAN WAS
NandanNilekani_2009@499.93:508.72 WHICH MEANT FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER AND TODAY 'S POLITICAL SLOGAN IS BIJLI SARAK PAANI WHICH MEANS ELECTRICITY WATER AND ROADS
NandanNilekani_2009@519.95:527.43 BECAUSE GANDHI BELIEVED IN VILLAGES AND BECAUSE THE BRITISH RULED FROM THE CITIES THEREFORE NEHRU THOUGHT OF NEW DELHI AS AN UN INDIAN CITY
NandanNilekani_2009@527.73:537.28 FOR A LONG TIME WE HAVE NEGLECTED OUR CITIES AND THAT IS REFLECTED IN THE KINDS OF SITUATIONS THAT YOU SEE BUT TODAY FINALLY AFTER ECONOMIC REFORMS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH
NandanNilekani_2009@537.54:545.41 I THINK THE NOTION THAT CITIES ARE ENGINES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH CITIES ARE ENGINES OF CREATIVITY CITIES ARE ENGINES OF INNOVATION
NandanNilekani_2009@558.03:567.14 YOU DIDN'T THINK OF INDIA AS A MARKET YOU DIDN'T REALLY BOTHER ABOUT A SINGLE MARKET BECAUSE IT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER AND THEREFORE YOU HAD A SITUATION WHERE EVERY STATE HAD ITS OWN MARKET FOR PRODUCTS
NandanNilekani_2009@578.15:585.90 A FORM OF INTERNAL GLOBALIZATION WHICH IS HAPPENING WHICH IS AS IMPORTANT AS EXTERNAL GLOBALIZATION THESE FOUR FACTORS I BELIEVE
NandanNilekani_2009@586.16:597.01 THE ONES OF PRIMARY EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE URBANIZATION AND SINGLE MARKET IN MY VIEW ARE IDEAS IN INDIA WHICH HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BUT NOT IMPLEMENTED THEN WE HAVE
NandanNilekani_2009@597.36:606.71 WHAT I BELIEVE ARE THE IDEAS IN CONFLICT THE IDEAS THAT WE ARGUE ABOUT THESE ARE THE ARGUMENTS WE HAVE WHICH CAUSE GRIDLOCK WHAT ARE THOSE IDEAS
NandanNilekani_2009@607.11:620.53 ONE IS I THINK OUR IDEOLOGICAL ISSUES BECAUSE OF THE HISTORICAL INDIAN BACKGROUND IN THE CASTE SYSTEM AND BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT IN THE COLD A LOT OF THE POLITICS IS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT
NandanNilekani_2009@621.41:630.29 THAT AND IT LEADS TO RESERVATIONS AND OTHER TECHNIQUES IT'S ALSO RELATED TO THE WAY THAT WE SUBSIDIZE OUR PEOPLE AND ALL THE LEFT AND RIGHT ARGUMENTS THAT WE HAVE
NandanNilekani_2009@630.66:643.78 A LOT OF THE INDIAN PROBLEMS ARE RELATED TO THE IDEOLOGY OF CASTE AND OTHER THINGS THIS POLICY IS CAUSING GRIDLOCK THIS IS ONE OF THE FACTORS WHICH NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED THE SECOND ONE IS THE LABOR POLICIES THAT WE HAVE
NandanNilekani_2009@644.12:653.34 WHICH MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT FOR ENTREPRENEURS TO CREATE STANDARDIZED JOBS IN COMPANIES THAT NINETY THREE PERCENT OF INDIAN LABOR IS IN THE UNORGANIZED SECTOR
NandanNilekani_2009@653.73:658.96 THEY HAVE NO BENEFITS THEY DON'T HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY THEY DON'T HAVE PENSION THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTHCARE NONE OF THOSE THINGS
NandanNilekani_2009@677.04:684.97 TO BE IN THE FORMAL SECTOR AND CREATE THE JOBS FOR THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT WE NEED TO CREATE JOBS FOR THE THIRD THING IS OUR HIGHER EDUCATION
NandanNilekani_2009@694.02:702.46 AS A RESULT OF THAT OUR HIGHER EDUCATION IS SIMPLY NOT KEEPING PACE WITH INDIA 'S DEMANDS THAT IS LEADING TO A LOT OF PROBLEMS WHICH WE NEED TO ADDRESS
NandanNilekani_2009@702.86:715.52 BUT MOST IMPORTANT I BELIEVE ARE THE IDEAS WE NEED TO ANTICIPATE HERE INDIA CAN LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WEST AND ELSEWHERE AND LOOK AT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE THE FIRST THING IS WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE THAT TECHNOLOGY IS AT A POINT
NandanNilekani_2009@725.24:734.24 AND MANY OTHER THINGS THE SECOND THING IS THE HEALTH ISSUE INDIA HAS EQUALLY HORRIBLE HEALTH PROBLEMS OF THE HIGHER STATE OF CARDIAC ISSUE THE HIGHER STATE OF
NandanNilekani_2009@734.93:742.77 THE HIGHER STATE OF OBESITY SO THERE IS NO POINT IN REPLACING A SET OF POOR COUNTRY DISEASES WITH A SET OF RICH COUNTRY DISEASES THEREFORE
NandanNilekani_2009@743.70:750.43 THE WHOLE WAY WE LOOK AT HEALTH WE REALLY NEED TO PUT IN PLACE A STRATEGY SO THAT WE DON'T GO TO THE OTHER EXTREME OF HEALTH
NandanNilekani_2009@768.21:780.68 AND THEN AGAIN INDIA DOES NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF MAKING ITS ENVIRONMENT DIRTY BECAUSE IT HAS TO MARRY ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT JUST TO GIVE AN IDEA THE WORLD HAS TO STABILIZE AT SOMETHING LIKE
NandanNilekani_2009@782.88:789.83 ON A POPULATION OF NINE BILLION OUR AVERAGE CARBON EMISSION WILL HAVE TO BE ABOUT TWO TONS PER YEAR INDIA IS ALREADY AT TWO TONS PER YEAR
NandanNilekani_2009@802.85:810.37 THE WAY WE LOOK AT THE ENVIRONMENT THE WAY WE LOOK AT ENERGY THE WAY WE CREATE WHOLE NEW PARADIGMS OF DEVELOPMENT NOW
NandanNilekani_2009@811.32:817.74 WHY DOES THIS MATTER TO YOU WHY DOES WHAT'S HAPPENING TEN THOUSAND MILES AWAY MATTER TO ALL OF YOU NUMBER ONE
NandanNilekani_2009@818.23:820.59 THIS MATTERS BECAUSE THIS REPRESENTS
NandanNilekani_2009@821.02:828.91 MORE THAN A BILLION PEOPLE A BILLION PEOPLE ONE SIXTH OF THE WORLD POPULATION IT MATTERS BECAUSE THIS IS A DEMOCRACY
NandanNilekani_2009@837.36:844.08 AND YOU CAN HAVE GROWTH IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS YOU CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF POVERTY IN THE WORLD
NandanNilekani_2009@870.03:880.37 WHEN INDIA WAS GROWING AT ABOUT THREE THREE POINT FIVE PERCENT AND THE POPULATION WAS GROWING AT TWO PERCENT ITS PER CAPITA INCOME WAS DOUBLING EVERY FORTY FIVE YEARS
NandanNilekani_2009@881.29:893.19 WHEN THE ECONOMIC GROWTH GOES TO EIGHT PERCENT AND POPULATION GROWTH DROPS TO ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT THEN PER CAPITA INCOME IS DOUBLING EVERY NINE YEARS IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE CERTAINLY FAST FORWARDING THIS WHOLE PROCESS
NandanNilekani_2009@893.43:905.74 OF A BILLION PEOPLE GOING TO PROSPERITY AND YOU MUST HAVE A CLEAR STRATEGY WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR INDIA AND IMPORTANT FOR THE WORLD THAT IS WHY I THINK ALL OF YOU SHOULD BE EQUALLY CONCERNED WITH IT AS I AM THANK YOU VERY MUCH
