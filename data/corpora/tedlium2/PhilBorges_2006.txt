PhilBorges_2006 FACT CAME OUT OF MIT
PhilBorges_2006 SO THAT IN ONE GENERATION WE'RE GOING TO HALVE OUR CULTURAL DIVERSITY HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT EVERY TWO WEEKS
PhilBorges_2006 AN ELDER GOES TO THE GRAVE CARRYING THE LAST SPOKEN WORD OF THAT CULTURE SO AN ENTIRE PHILOSOPHY
PhilBorges_2006 A BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE NATURAL WORLD THAT HAD BEEN EMPIRICALLY GLEANED OVER CENTURIES GOES AWAY
PhilBorges_2006 AND THIS HAPPENS EVERY TWO WEEKS SO FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS SINCE MY
PhilBorges_2006 HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THE WORLD AND COMING BACK WITH STORIES ABOUT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE
PhilBorges_2006 AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO RIGHT NOW IS SHARE SOME OF THOSE STORIES WITH YOU THIS IS TAMDIN SHE IS A SIXTY NINE YEAR OLD NUN
PhilBorges_2006 SHE WAS THROWN IN PRISON IN TIBET FOR TWO YEARS FOR PUTTING UP A LITTLE TINY PLACARD PROTESTING THE OCCUPATION OF HER COUNTRY
PhilBorges_2006 AND WHEN I MET HER SHE HAD JUST TAKEN A WALK OVER THE HIMALAYAS FROM LHASA THE CAPITAL OF TIBET
PhilBorges_2006 INTO NEPAL ACROSS TO INDIA
PhilBorges_2006 THIRTY DAYS TO MEET HER LEADER THE DALAI LAMA THE DALAI LAMA LIVES IN DHARAMSALA INDIA SO I TOOK THIS PICTURE THREE DAYS AFTER SHE ARRIVED
PhilBorges_2006 AND HE WAS HIS WHOLE MONASTERY WAS THROWN INTO PRISON AT THE TIME OF THE UPRISING WHEN THE DALAI LAMA HAD TO LEAVE
PhilBorges_2006 AND
PhilBorges_2006 HE WAS BEATEN STARVED TORTURED LOST ALL HIS TEETH WHILE IN PRISON AND WHEN I MET HIM HE WAS A KIND GENTLE OLD MAN
PhilBorges_2006 AND IT REALLY IMPRESSED ME I MET HIM TWO WEEKS AFTER HE GOT OUT OF PRISON THAT HE WENT THROUGH THAT EXPERIENCE AND ENDED UP WITH THE DEMEANOR THAT HE HAD
PhilBorges_2006 SO I WAS IN DHARAMSALA MEETING THESE PEOPLE AND I'D SPENT ABOUT FIVE WEEKS THERE AND I WAS HEARING THESE SIMILAR STORIES OF THESE REFUGEES THAT HAD POURED OUT OF TIBET
PhilBorges_2006 INTO DHARAMSALA AND IT JUST SO HAPPENED ON THE FIFTH WEEK THERE WAS A PUBLIC TEACHING BY THE DALAI LAMA
PhilBorges_2006 AND
PhilBorges_2006 AND I WAS WATCHING THIS CROWD OF MONKS AND NUNS MANY OF WHICH I HAD JUST INTERVIEWED AND HEARD THEIR STORIES AND I WATCHED THEIR FACES AND THEY GAVE US A LITTLE FM RADIO AND WE COULD LISTEN TO THE TRANSLATION OF HIS TEACHINGS
PhilBorges_2006 AND WHAT HE SAID WAS
PhilBorges_2006 TREAT YOUR ENEMIES AS IF THEY WERE PRECIOUS JEWELS
PhilBorges_2006 BECAUSE IT'S YOUR ENEMIES THAT BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE AND PATIENCE ON THE ROAD TO YOUR ENLIGHTENMENT AND I
PhilBorges_2006 THAT HIT ME SO HARD
PhilBorges_2006 AND I STARTED INTERVIEWING THE PEOPLE THERE TAKING MY PHOTOGRAPHS THAT'S WHAT I DO I INTERVIEW AND DO PORTRAITS AND AND THIS IS A LITTLE GIRL I TOOK HER PORTRAIT UP ON TOP OF THE JOKHANG TEMPLE
PhilBorges_2006 AND I'D SNUCK IN BECAUSE IT'S TOTALLY ILLEGAL TO HAVE A PICTURE OF THE DALAI LAMA IN TIBET IT'S THE QUICKEST WAY YOU CAN GET ARRESTED
PhilBorges_2006 SO I SNUCK IN A BUNCH OF LITTLE WALLET SIZED PICTURES OF THE DALAI LAMA AND I WOULD HAND THEM OUT AND WHEN I GAVE THEM TO THE PEOPLE
PhilBorges_2006 I WAS GOING IN INTERVIEWING THESE PEOPLE AND DOING THEIR PORTRAITS THIS IS JIGME AND HER SISTER SONAM AND THEY LIVE UP ON THE CHANG TANG THE TIBETAN PLATEAU WAY IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY THIS IS AT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FEET
PhilBorges_2006 AND THEY HAD JUST COME DOWN FROM THE HIGH PASTURES AT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FEET SAME THING GAVE HER A PICTURE SHE HELD IT UP TO HER FOREHEAD
PhilBorges_2006 AND I USUALLY HAND OUT POLAROIDS WHEN I DO THESE BECAUSE I'M SETTING UP LIGHTS AND CHECKING MY LIGHTS AND WHEN I SHOWED HER A POLAROID SHE SCREAMED AND RAN INTO HER TENT
PhilBorges_2006 WAY OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE AT THE AGE OF FOUR HE WAS INSTALLED AS THE FOURTEENTH DALAI LAMA
PhilBorges_2006 AS A TEENAGER HE FACED
PhilBorges_2006 THE INVASION OF HIS COUNTRY AND HAD TO DEAL WITH IT HE WAS THE LEADER OF THE COUNTRY EIGHT YEARS LATER WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THERE WAS A PLOT TO KILL HIM
PhilBorges_2006 THEY DRESSED HIM UP LIKE A BEGGAR AND SNUCK HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY ON A HORSEBACK AND TOOK THE SAME TRIP THAT TAMDIN DID AND HE LIVES IN AND HE 'S NEVER BEEN BACK TO HIS COUNTRY SINCE AND
PhilBorges_2006 IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS MAN FORTY SIX YEARS LATER STILL STICKING TO THIS NON VIOLENT RESPONSE
PhilBorges_2006 TO A SEVERE POLITICAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE YOUNG TIBETANS ARE STARTING TO SAY LISTEN THIS DOESN'T WORK YOU KNOW
PhilBorges_2006 HE STILL IS HOLDING THIS LINE SO THIS IS OUR ICON
PhilBorges_2006 TO NON VIOLENCE IN OUR WORLD ONE OF OUR LIVING ICONS
PhilBorges_2006 THIS IS ANOTHER LEADER OF HIS PEOPLE THIS IS MOI THIS IS IN THE ECUADORIAN AMAZON AND MOI IS THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND
PhilBorges_2006 AS MUCH OIL OR TWICE AS MUCH OIL AS WAS SPILLED IN THE EXXON VALDEZ ACCIDENT
PhilBorges_2006 WAS SPILLED IN THIS LITTLE AREA OF THE AMAZON AND THE TRIBES IN THIS AREA HAVE CONSTANTLY HAD TO MOVE AND
PhilBorges_2006 BELONGS TO THE HUAORANI TRIBE AND THEY'RE KNOWN AS VERY FIERCE THEY'RE KNOWN AS AUCA AND THEY'VE MANAGED TO KEEP OUT THE SEISMOLOGISTS AND THE OIL OIL WORKERS WITH SPEARS AND BLOWGUNS
PhilBorges_2006 AND I SPENT WE SPENT I WAS WITH A TEAM TWO WEEKS WITH THESE GUYS OUT IN THE JUNGLE WATCHING THEM HUNT THIS WAS ON A MONKEY HUNT
PhilBorges_2006 AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT IS INCREDIBLE THEY COULD HEAR THINGS SMELL THINGS SEE THINGS I COULDN'T SEE AND I COULDN'T EVEN SEE THE MONKEYS THAT THEY WERE GETTING WITH THESE DARTS
PhilBorges_2006 THIS IS YADIRA AND YADIRA IS FIVE YEARS OLD SHE'S IN A A TRIBE THAT'S NEIGHBORING THE
PhilBorges_2006 AND HER TRIBE HAS HAD TO MOVE THREE TIMES IN THE LAST TEN YEARS BECAUSE OF THE OIL SPILLS AND WE NEVER HEAR ABOUT THAT AND THE LATEST
PhilBorges_2006 THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF THE ECUADORIAN AMAZON IN OUR WAR ON DRUGS
PhilBorges_2006 AND THESE PEOPLE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE THE BRUNT OF IT
PhilBorges_2006 THIS IS MENGATOUE HE 'S THE SHAMAN OF THE HUAORANI AND HE
PhilBorges_2006 HE JUST HE SAID TO US YOU KNOW I'M AN OLDER MAN NOW I'M GETTING TIRED YOU KNOW I'M TIRED OF SPEARING THESE OIL WORKERS I WISH THEY WOULD JUST GO AWAY
PhilBorges_2006 AND I WAS I USUALLY TRAVEL ALONE WHEN I DO MY WORK BUT I DID THIS I HOSTED A PROGRAM FOR DISCOVERY AND WHEN I WENT DOWN WITH THE TEAM I WAS
PhilBorges_2006 ONE OF THE THINGS
PhilBorges_2006 JUST BEFORE NINE ELEVEN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND AND ONE
PhilBorges_2006 I TOOK MY SON DAX WHO WAS SIXTEEN AT THE TIME AND I TOOK HIM TO PAKISTAN BECAUSE AT FIRST I WANTED YOU KNOW I'VE TAKEN HIM ON A COUPLE OF TRIPS
PhilBorges_2006 BUT I WANTED HIM TO SEE PEOPLE THAT LIVE ON A DOLLAR A DAY OR LESS I WANTED HIM TO GET AN EXPERIENCE IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD
PhilBorges_2006 AND I ALSO WANTED HIM TO I WAS GOING THERE TO WORK WITH A GROUP DO A STORY ON A GROUP CALLED THE KALASH THAT ARE A GROUP OF ANIMISTS THREE THOUSAND ANIMISTS THAT LIVE VERY SMALL AREA SURROUNDED BY ISLAM THERE'S THREE THOUSAND
PhilBorges_2006 OF THESE KALASH LEFT THEY'RE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE SO IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR HIM HE STAYED UP ALL NIGHT WITH THEM DRUMMING AND DANCING
PhilBorges_2006 AND HE BROUGHT A SOCCER BALL AND WE HAD SOCCER EVERY NIGHT IN THIS LITTLE VILLAGE AND THEN WE WENT UP AND MET THEIR
PhilBorges_2006 BY THE WAY MENGATOUE WAS THE SHAMAN OF HIS TRIBE AS WELL AND THIS IS JOHN DOOLIKAHN WHO 'S
PhilBorges_2006 AND HE 'S UP IN THE MOUNTAINS RIGHT ON THE BORDER WITH AFGHANISTAN IN FACT ON THAT OTHER SIDE IS THE AREA TORA BORA THE AREA WHERE OSAMA BIN LADEN 'S SUPPOSED TO BE THIS IS THE TRIBAL AREA AND
PhilBorges_2006 WE WATCHED AND STAYED WITH
PhilBorges_2006 JOHN DOOLIKAHN AND
PhilBorges_2006 THE SHAMAN I DID A WHOLE SERIES ON SHAMANISM WHICH IS A AN INTERESTING PHENOMENON BUT AROUND THE WORLD
PhilBorges_2006 THEY GO INTO TRANCE IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND IN PAKISTAN THE WAY THEY DO IT IS THEY BURN JUNIPER LEAVES AND THEY SACRIFICE AN ANIMAL POUR THE BLOOD OF THE ANIMAL ON THE LEAVES AND THEN INHALE THE SMOKE
PhilBorges_2006 AND THEY'RE ALL PRAYING TO THE MOUNTAIN GODS AS THEY AS THEY GO INTO TRANCE THAT WAS
PhilBorges_2006 YOU KNOW GETTING KIDS USED TO DIFFERENT REALITIES I THINK IS SO IMPORTANT WHAT DAN DENNETT SAID THE OTHER DAY
PhilBorges_2006 HAVING A CURRICULUM WHERE THEY STUDY DIFFERENT RELIGIONS JUST TO MAKE A MENTAL FLEXIBILITY GIVE THEM A MENTAL FLEXIBILITY IN DIFFERENT BELIEF SYSTEMS I THINK THIS IS SO
PhilBorges_2006 FIVE YEARS AGO WE STARTED A PROGRAM THAT LINKS KIDS IN INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES WITH KIDS IN THE UNITED STATES SO WE FIRST HOOKED UP
PhilBorges_2006 SPOT IN THE NAVAJO NATION WITH A CLASSROOM IN SEATTLE WE NOW HAVE FIFTEEN SITES

PhilBorges_2006 PERU AND ARCTIC VILLAGE ALASKA THIS IS DANIEL HE 'S ONE OF OUR STUDENTS IN ARCTIC VILLAGE ALASKA HE LIVES IN THIS LOG CABIN
PhilBorges_2006 NO RUNNING WATER NO HEAT OTHER THAN NO WINDOWS AND HIGH SPEED INTERNET CONNECTION AND THIS IS
PhilBorges_2006 THIS IS I SEE THIS ROLLING OUT ALL OVER THIS IS OUR SITE IN OLLANTAYTAMBO PERU FOUR YEARS AGO WHERE THEY FIRST SAW THEIR FIRST COMPUTERS NOW THEY HAVE COMPUTERS IN THEIR CLASSROOMS
PhilBorges_2006 AND THE WAY WE DO IT IS WE DO IT IN WORKSHOPS AND WE BRING PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LEARN DIGITAL WORKFLOW AND STORYTELLING AND HAVE THEM
PhilBorges_2006 WORK WITH THE KIDS AND JUST THIS LAST YEAR WE'VE TAKEN A GROUP OF TEENAGERS IN AND THIS HAS WORKED THE BEST SO OUR DREAM IS TO BRING TEENAGERS TOGETHER SO THEY'LL HAVE A COMMUNITY SERVICE EXPERIENCE
PhilBorges_2006 AS WELL AS A CROSS CULTURAL EXPERIENCE AS THEY TEACH KIDS IN THESE AREAS AND HELP THEM BUILD THEIR COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE THIS IS TEACHING PHOTOSHOP IN THE CHILDREN 'S TIBETAN CHILDREN 'S VILLAGE IN DHARAMSALA

PhilBorges_2006 AND SHOWING ONE OF THE MOVIES THAT THEY MADE AND IF YOU GET A CHANCE YOU CAN GO TO OUR WEBSITE AND YOU'LL SEE THE INCREDIBLE WORK THESE KIDS DO
PhilBorges_2006 THE KIDS IN OUR THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO GIVE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE A VOICE THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIG MOTIVATING FACTORS
PhilBorges_2006 BUT THE OTHER MOTIVATING FACTOR IS THE INSULAR NATURE OF OUR COUNTRY NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC JUST DID A ROPER STUDY OF EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY SIX YEAR OLDS IN
PhilBorges_2006 OUR COUNTRY AND IN NINE OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES IT WAS A TWO MILLION DOLLAR STUDY UNITED STATES CAME IN SECOND TO LAST
PhilBorges_2006 IN GEOGRAPHIC KNOWLEDGE SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE KIDS COULDN'T FIND AFGHANISTAN OR IRAQ ON A MAP
PhilBorges_2006 SIXTY PERCENT COULDN'T FIND INDIA
PhilBorges_2006 THIRTY PERCENT COULDN'T FIND THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND THIS IS A STUDY THAT WAS JUST DONE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
PhilBorges_2006 SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU NOW IN THE COUPLE OF MINUTES I HAVE LEFT
