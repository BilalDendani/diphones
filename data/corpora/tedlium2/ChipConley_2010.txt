ChipConley_2010@30.41:39.02 BUT I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE COUNT BECAUSE WHAT WE ACTUALLY COUNT TRULY COUNTS LET ME START BY TELLING YOU A LITTLE STORY
ChipConley_2010@73.17:87.26 AND THIS FIRST HOTEL THAT I BOUGHT MOTEL WAS A PAY BY THE HOUR NO TELL MOTEL IN THE INNER CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AS I SPENT TIME WITH VIVIAN I SAW THAT SHE HAD SORT OF A JOIE DE VIVRE IN HOW SHE DID HER WORK
ChipConley_2010@89.47:97.91 AND CURIOUS HOW COULD SOMEONE ACTUALLY FIND JOY IN ACTUALLY CLEANING TOILETS FOR A LIVING SO I SPENT TIME WITH VIVIAN AND I SAW THAT
ChipConley_2010@98.33:110.42 SHE DIDN'T FIND JOY IN CLEANING TOILETS HER JOB HER GOAL AND HER CALLING WAS NOT TO BECOME THE WORLD 'S GREATEST TOILET SCRUBBER WHAT COUNTS FOR VIVIAN WAS THE EMOTIONAL CONNECTION SHE CREATED WITH HER FELLOW EMPLOYEES AND OUR GUESTS
ChipConley_2010@121.28:122.81 THAT VERY HUMAN LESSON
ChipConley_2010@123.21:128.55 MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO SERVED ME WELL DURING THE LAST ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WE HAD
ChipConley_2010@129.16:142.03 IN THE WAKE OF THE DOTCOM CRASH AND NINE ELEVEN SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA HOTELS WENT THROUGH THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE REVENUE DROP IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN HOTELS WE WERE THE LARGEST OPERATOR OF HOTELS IN THE BAY AREA SO WE WERE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE
ChipConley_2010@142.46:152.12 BUT ALSO BACK THEN REMEMBER WE STOPPED EATING FRENCH FRIES IN THIS COUNTRY WELL NOT EXACTLY OF COURSE NOT WE ACTUALLY STARTED EATING FREEDOM FRIES
ChipConley_2010@194.63:205.56 AND THAT'S WHERE I GOT REACQUAINTED WITH ABRAHAM MASLOW 'S HIERARCHY OF NEEDS I TOOK ONE PSYCHOLOGY CLASS IN COLLEGE AND I LEARNED ABOUT THIS GUY ABRAHAM MASLOW AS MANY OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH HIS HIERARCHY OF NEEDS
ChipConley_2010@206.05:218.75 AS I SAT THERE FOR FOUR HOURS THE FULL AFTERNOON READING MASLOW I ACTUALLY RECOGNIZED SOMETHING THAT IS TRUE OF MOST LEADERS AND ONE OF THE SIMPLEST FACTS IN BUSINESS IS SOMETHING THAT WE OFTEN NEGLECT
ChipConley_2010@219.50:220.99 AND THAT IS THAT WE'RE ALL HUMAN
ChipConley_2010@221.77:231.57 AND EACH OF US NO MATTER WHAT OUR ROLE IS IN BUSINESS ACTUALLY HAS SOME HIERARCHY OF NEEDS IN THE WORKPLACE SO AS I STARTED READING MORE MASLOW WHAT I ACTUALLY STARTED TO REALIZE
ChipConley_2010@231.94:241.07 IS THAT ACTUALLY MASLOW LATER IN HIS LIFE WANTED TO TAKE THIS HIERARCHY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND APPLY IT TO THE COLLECTIVE TO ORGANIZATIONS AND SPECIFICALLY TO BUSINESS
ChipConley_2010@249.54:257.86 MY ROLE IN LIFE WAS TO CHANNEL ABE MASLOW AND THAT'S WHAT I DID A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN I TOOK THAT FIVE LEVEL HIERARCHY OF NEEDS PYRAMID
ChipConley_2010@258.02:265.98 AND TURNED IT INTO WHAT I CALL THE TRANSFORMATION PYRAMID WHICH IS SURVIVAL SUCCESS AND TRANSFORMATION IT'S NOT JUST FUNDAMENTAL IN BUSINESS IT'S FUNDAMENTAL IN LIFE
ChipConley_2010@281.05:291.50 BUT AS WE STARTED ASKING OURSELVES ABOUT HOW WE WERE ADDRESSING THE HIGHER NEEDS OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR CUSTOMERS I REALIZED WE HAD NO METRICS WE HAD NOTHING THAT ACTUALLY COULD TELL US WHETHER WE WERE ACTUALLY GETTING IT RIGHT
ChipConley_2010@291.86:300.06 SO WE ACTUALLY STARTED ASKING OURSELVES WHAT KIND OF LESS OBVIOUS METRICS COULD WE USE TO ACTUALLY EVALUATE OUR EMPLOYEES SENSE OF MEANING
ChipConley_2010@300.31:307.27 OR OUR CUSTOMERS SENSE OF EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH US FOR EXAMPLE WE ACTUALLY STARTED ASKING OUR EMPLOYEES DO THEY UNDERSTAND THE MISSION OF OUR COMPANY
ChipConley_2010@351.68:359.80 THEY DIDN'T EVEN SEE THE INTANGIBLE STUFF HIGHER UP THE PYRAMID SO I STARTED ASKING MYSELF THE QUESTION HOW CAN WE GET LEADERS TO START VALUING THE INTANGIBLE
ChipConley_2010@360.01:368.36 IF WE'RE TAUGHT AS LEADERS TO JUST MANAGE WHAT WE CAN MEASURE AND ALL WE CAN MEASURE IS THE TANGIBLE IN LIFE WE'RE MISSING A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID
ChipConley_2010@369.17:378.68 SO I ACTUALLY WENT OUT AND STUDIED A BUNCH OF THINGS AND I FOUND A SURVEY THAT SHOWED THAT NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF BUSINESS LEADERS WORLDWIDE BELIEVE THAT THE INTANGIBLES ARE IMPORTANT IN THEIR BUSINESS
ChipConley_2010@388.71:398.12 SO AS LEADERS WE UNDERSTAND THAT INTANGIBLES ARE IMPORTANT BUT WE DON'T HAVE A CLUE ACTUALLY TO HOW TO MEASURE THEM SO HERE 'S ANOTHER EINSTEIN QUOTE NOT EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE
ChipConley_2010@398.51:406.50 COUNTED COUNTS AND NOT EVERYTHING THAT COUNTS CAN BE COUNTED I HATE TO ARGUE WITH EINSTEIN
ChipConley_2010@407.31:418.43 BUT IF THAT WHICH IS MOST VALUABLE IN OUR LIFE AND OUR BUSINESS ACTUALLY CAN'T BE COUNTED OR VALUED AREN'T WE GOING TO SPEND OUR LIVES JUST MIRED IN MEASURING THE MUNDANE
ChipConley_2010@419.36:426.95 IT WAS THAT SORT OF HEADY QUESTION ABOUT WHAT COUNTS THAT LED ME TO TAKE MY CEO HAT OFF FOR A WEEK AND FLY OFF TO THE HIMALAYAN PEAKS
ChipConley_2010@428.17:441.46 OFF TO A PLACE THAT'S BEEN SHROUDED IN MYSTERY FOR CENTURIES A PLACE SOME FOLKS CALL SHANGRI LA IT'S ACTUALLY MOVED FROM THE SURVIVAL BASE OF THE PYRAMID TO BECOMING A TRANSFORMATIONAL ROLE MODEL FOR THE WORLD I WENT TO
ChipConley_2010@450.87:457.74 FATHER PASSED AWAY AT AGE SEVENTEEN HE STARTED ASKING THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU'D EXPECT OF SOMEONE WITH A BEGINNER 'S MIND
ChipConley_2010@458.21:468.45 ON A TRIP THROUGH INDIA EARLY IN HIS REIGN AS KING HE ACTUALLY WAS ASKED BY AN INDIAN JOURNALIST ABOUT THE BHUTANESE GDP THE SIZE OF THE BHUTANESE GDP
ChipConley_2010@469.70:483.54 AND THE KING RESPONDED IN A FASHION THAT ACTUALLY HAS TRANSFORMED US FOUR DECADES LATER HE SAID THE FOLLOWING HE SAID WHY ARE WE SO OBSESSED AND FOCUSED WITH GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT WHY DON'T WE CARE MORE ABOUT GROSS NATIONAL HAPPINESS
ChipConley_2010@484.12:489.26 NOW IN ESSENCE THE KING WAS ASKING US TO CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE DEFINITION OF SUCCESS WHAT
ChipConley_2010@490.30:498.34 KNOWN AS GNH OR GROSS NATIONAL HAPPINESS MOST WORLD LEADERS DIDN'T TAKE NOTICE AND THOSE THAT DID THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST BUDDHIST ECONOMICS
ChipConley_2010@499.94:501.86 BUT THE KING WAS SERIOUS AND THIS WAS A
ChipConley_2010@502.05:511.45 NOTABLE MOMENT BECAUSE THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME A WORLD LEADER IN ALMOST TWO HUNDRED YEARS HAD SUGGESTED THAT INTANGIBLE OF HAPPINESS
ChipConley_2010@512.12:526.14 AGAIN THAT LEADER TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO THOMAS JEFFERSON WITH THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE TWO HUNDRED YEARS LATER THIS KING WAS SUGGESTING THAT INTANGIBLE OF HAPPINESS IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD MEASURE AND IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD ACTUALLY VALUE AS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
ChipConley_2010@526.42:535.08 FOR THE NEXT THREE DOZEN YEARS AS KING THIS KING ACTUALLY STARTED MEASURING AND MANAGING AROUND HAPPINESS IN BHUTAN
ChipConley_2010@557.17:566.64 QUESTION I ASKED HIM HOW CAN YOU CREATE AND MEASURE SOMETHING WHICH EVAPORATES IN OTHER WORDS HAPPINESS
ChipConley_2010@566.99:578.12 AND HE 'S A VERY WISE MAN AND HE SAID LISTEN BHUTAN 'S GOAL IS NOT TO CREATE HAPPINESS WE CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR HAPPINESS TO OCCUR IN OTHER WORDS WE CREATE A HABITAT OF HAPPINESS
ChipConley_2010@588.35:598.14 THAT ACTUALLY HELP TO ACTUALLY MEASURE THEIR GNH IN FACT ONE OF THOSE KEY INDICATORS IS HOW DO THE BHUTANESE FEEL ABOUT HOW THEY SPEND THEIR TIME EACH DAY
ChipConley_2010@598.68:612.27 IT'S A GOOD QUESTION HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HOW YOU SPEND YOUR TIME EACH DAY TIME IS ONE OF THE SCARCEST RESOURCES IN THE MODERN WORLD AND YET OF COURSE THAT LITTLE INTANGIBLE PIECE OF DATA DOESN'T FACTOR INTO OUR GDP CALCULATIONS
ChipConley_2010@612.65:625.84 SO AS I SPENT MY WEEK UP IN THE HIMALAYAS ACTUALLY I STARTED TO IMAGINE WHAT I CALL AN EMOTIONAL EQUATION AND IT FOCUSES ON SOMETHING I READ LONG AGO FROM A GUY NAMED RABBI HYMAN SCHACHTEL HOW MANY KNOW HIM ANYBODY
ChipConley_2010@634.88:648.99 INSTEAD IT'S ABOUT WANTING WHAT YOU HAVE OR IN OTHER WORDS I THINK THE BHUTANESE BELIEVE HAPPINESS EQUALS WANTING WHAT YOU HAVE IMAGINE GRATITUDE DIVIDED BY HAVING WHAT YOU WANT GRATIFICATION
ChipConley_2010@649.59:657.45 THE BHUTANESE AREN'T ON SOME ASPIRATIONAL TREADMILL CONSTANTLY FOCUSED ON WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR RELIGION THEIR ISOLATION
ChipConley_2010@657.67:665.41 THEIR DEEP RESPECT FOR THEIR CULTURE AND NOW THE PRINCIPLES OF THEIR GNH MOVEMENT ALL HAVE FOSTERED A SENSE OF GRATITUDE ABOUT WHAT THEY DO HAVE
ChipConley_2010@665.97:677.38 HOW MANY OF US HERE AS TEDSTERS IN THE AUDIENCE SPEND MORE OF OUR TIME IN THE BOTTOM HALF OF THIS EQUATION IN THE DENOMINATOR WE ARE A BOTTOM HEAVY CULTURE IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
ChipConley_2010@701.17:711.44 DO WE PURSUE HAPPINESS WITH HOSTILITY GOOD QUESTION BUT BACK TO BHUTAN BHUTAN 'S ACTUALLY BORDERED ON ITS NORTH AND SOUTH BY THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE WORLD 'S POPULATION
ChipConley_2010@711.99:723.42 COULD THIS LITTLE COUNTRY LIKE A STARTUP IN A MATURE INDUSTRY BE THE SPARK PLUG THAT ACTUALLY INFLUENCES A TWENTY ONE ST CENTURY OF MIDDLE CLASS IN CHINA AND INDIA
ChipConley_2010@734.08:744.25 YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THIS LAST FALL NICOLAS SARKOZY IN FRANCE ANNOUNCING THE RESULTS OF AN EIGHTEEN MONTH STUDY BY TWO NOBEL ECONOMISTS FOCUSING ON HAPPINESS AND WELLNESS IN FRANCE
ChipConley_2010@744.77:756.73 SARKOZY SUGGESTED THAT WORLD LEADERS SHOULD STOP MYOPICALLY FOCUSING ON GDP AND CONSIDER A NEW INDEX WHAT SOME FRENCH ARE CALLING A JOIE DE VIVRE INDEX I LIKE IT
ChipConley_2010@757.32:765.92 CO BRANDING OPPORTUNITIES AND JUST THREE DAYS AGO THREE DAYS AGO HERE AT TED WE ACTUALLY HAD A SIMULCAST OF DAVID CAMERON POTENTIALLY THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER OF THE UK
ChipConley_2010@779.53:787.39 SO IT SUGGESTS THAT THE MOMENTUM IS SHIFTING I'VE TAKEN THAT ROBERT KENNEDY QUOTE AND I'VE ACTUALLY TURNED IT INTO A NEW BALANCE SHEET FOR JUST A MOMENT HERE
ChipConley_2010@787.71:795.83 THIS IS ACTUALLY A COLLECTION OF THINGS THAT ROBERT KENNEDY SAID IN THAT QUOTE GDP COUNTS EVERYTHING FROM AIR POLLUTION TO THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR REDWOODS
ChipConley_2010@804.70:813.10 IT MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S TIME FOR US TO START FIGURING OUT A NEW WAY TO COUNT A NEW WAY TO ACTUALLY IMAGINE WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO US
ChipConley_2010@827.20:836.48 SO HOW DO WE DO THAT LET ME SAY ONE THING WE CAN JUST START DOING TEN YEARS FROM NOW AT LEAST IN THIS COUNTRY WHY IN THE HECK IN AMERICA ARE WE DOING
ChipConley_2010@861.11:867.73 LONG AGO SOMETHING YOU'VE HEARD BEFORE BUT YOU DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS HIM HE SAID IF THE ONLY TOOL YOU HAVE IS A HAMMER
ChipConley_2010@871.18:872.71 WE'VE BEEN FOOLED BY OUR TOOL
ChipConley_2010@877.41:880.34 WE'VE BEEN FOOLED BY OUR TOOL GDP HAS BEEN OUR HAMMER
ChipConley_2010@896.41:908.66 AND ONLY THIRTY SIX PERCENT IS IN THE TANGIBLE INDUSTRIES OF MANUFACTURING AND AGRICULTURE SO MAYBE IT'S TIME THAT WE GET A BIGGER TOOLBOX RIGHT MAYBE IT'S TIME WE ACTUALLY GET A TOOLBOX THAT DOESN'T JUST COUNT WHAT'S EASILY COUNTED THE TANGIBLE IN LIFE
ChipConley_2010@908.92:918.18 BUT ACTUALLY COUNTS WHAT WE MOST VALUE THE THINGS THAT ARE INTANGIBLE I GUESS I'M SORT OF A CURIOUS CEO I WAS ALSO A CURIOUS ECONOMICS MAJOR AS AN UNDERGRAD
ChipConley_2010@918.46:927.76 AND I LEARNED THAT ECONOMISTS MEASURE EVERYTHING IN TANGIBLE UNITS OF PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION AS IF EACH OF THOSE TANGIBLE UNITS IS EXACTLY THE SAME
ChipConley_2010@941.47:951.40 IN FACT IN VIVIAN 'S CASE HER UNIT OF PRODUCTION ISN'T THE TANGIBLE HOURS SHE WORKS IT'S THE INTANGIBLE DIFFERENCE SHE MAKES DURING THAT ONE HOUR OF WORK
ChipConley_2010@951.72:964.79 THIS IS DAVE ARRINGDALE WHO 'S ACTUALLY BEEN A LONGTIME GUEST AT VIVIAN 'S MOTEL HE STAYED THERE A HUNDRED TIMES IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AND HE 'S LOYAL TO THE PROPERTY BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP THAT VIVIAN AND AND HER FELLOW EMPLOYEES HAVE CREATED WITH
ChipConley_2010@965.63:975.44 A HABITAT OF HAPPINESS FOR DAVE AND HE TELLS ME THAT HE CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON VIVIAN AND THE STAFF THERE TO MAKE HIM FEEL AT HOME
ChipConley_2010@976.53:987.24 WHY IS IT THAT BUSINESS LEADERS AND INVESTORS QUITE OFTEN DON'T SEE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN CREATING THE INTANGIBLE OF EMPLOYEE HAPPINESS
ChipConley_2010@999.32:1002.12 IN FACT INSPIRED EMPLOYEES QUITE OFTEN HELP MAKE
ChipConley_2010@1011.66:1012.87 WHO KNOW WHAT TO COUNT
ChipConley_2010@1014.06:1021.51 WE COUNT NUMBERS WE COUNT ON PEOPLE WHAT REALLY COUNTS IS WHEN WE ACTUALLY USE OUR NUMBERS
ChipConley_2010@1021.66:1028.80 TO TRULY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OUR PEOPLE I LEARNED THAT FROM A MAID IN A MOTEL AND A KING OF A COUNTRY
ChipConley_2010@1029.45:1032.74 WHAT CAN YOU START COUNTING TODAY
ChipConley_2010@1033.69:1041.18 WHAT ONE THING CAN YOU START COUNTING TODAY THAT ACTUALLY WOULD BE MEANINGFUL IN YOUR LIFE WHETHER IT'S YOUR WORK LIFE OR YOUR BUSINESS LIFE
