AmoryLovins_2005 SO GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO MAKE US DO SOMETHING PAINFUL TO FIX IT THE NEW STORY ABOUT CLIMATE PROTECTION IS THAT IT 'S NOT COSTLY BUT PROFITABLE THIS WAS A SIMPLE SIGN ERROR BECAUSE IT 'S CHEAPER TO SAVE FUEL THAN TO BUY FUEL
AmoryLovins_2005 AS IS WELL KNOWN TO COMPANIES THAT DO IT ALL THE TIME FOR EXAMPLE DUPONT SD MICRO ELECTRONICS
AmoryLovins_2005 MANY OTHER FIRMS IBM ARE REDUCING THEIR ENERGY INTENSITY ROUTINELY SIX PERCENT A YEAR BY FIXING UP THEIR PLANTS AND THEY GET THEIR MONEY BACK IN TWO OR THREE YEARS THAT 'S CALLED A PROFIT NOW SIMILARLY THE OLD STORY ABOUT OIL
AmoryLovins_2005 IS THAT IF WE WANTED TO SAVE VERY MUCH OF IT IT WOULD BE EXPENSIVE OR WE WOULD HAVE DONE IT ALREADY BECAUSE MARKETS ARE ESSENTIALLY PERFECT IF OF COURSE THAT WERE TRUE THERE WOULD BE NO INNOVATION AND NOBODY COULD MAKE ANY MONEY
AmoryLovins_2005 BUT THE NEW STORY ABOUT OIL IS THE GOVERNMENT DOESN 'T HAVE TO FORCE US TO DO PAINFUL THINGS TO GET OFF OIL
AmoryLovins_2005 NOT JUST INCREMENTALLY BUT COMPLETELY QUITE THE CONTRARY THE UNITED STATES FOR EXAMPLE CAN COMPLETELY ELIMINATE ITS USE OF OIL AND REJUVENATE THE ECONOMY AT THE SAME TIME LED BY BUSINESS FOR PROFIT BECAUSE IT 'S SO MUCH CHEAPER TO SAVE AND SUBSTITUTE FOR THE OIL THAN TO KEEP ON BUYING IT
AmoryLovins_2005 THIS PROCESS WILL ALSO BE CATALYZED BY THE MILITARY FOR ITS OWN REASONS OF COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS AND PREVENTING CONFLICT PARTICULARLY OVER OIL
AmoryLovins_2005 THIS THESIS IS SET OUT IN A BOOK CALLED WINNING THE OIL ENDGAME THAT FOUR COLLEAGUES AND I WROTE AND HAVE POSTED FOR FREE AT OILENDGAME COM ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND DOWNLOADS SO FAR AND IT WAS CO SPONSORED BY THE PENTAGON IT 'S INDEPENDENT IT 'S PEER REVIEWED AND ALL OF THE
AmoryLovins_2005 BACKUP CALCULATIONS ARE TRANSPARENTLY POSTED FOR YOUR
AmoryLovins_2005 AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE OF THE BIGGEST U S INDUSTRIES WAS WHALING AND WHALE OIL LIT PRACTICALLY EVERY BUILDING BUT IN THE NINE YEARS BEFORE DRAKE STRUCK OIL IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE AT LEAST FIVE SIXTHS OF THAT WHALE OIL ILLUMINATING MARKET DISAPPEARED THANKS TO FATAL COMPETITORS CHIEFLY
AmoryLovins_2005 OIL AND GAS MADE FROM COAL TO WHICH THE WHALERS HAD NOT BEEN PAYING ATTENTION
AmoryLovins_2005 SO VERY UNEXPECTEDLY THEY RAN OUT OF CUSTOMERS BEFORE THEY RAN OUT OF WHALES THE REMNANT WHALE POPULATIONS WERE SAVED BY TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATORS AND PROFIT MAXIMIZING CAPITALISTS
AmoryLovins_2005 NOW THERE ARE TWO BIG REASONS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT OIL BOTH NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS AND NATIONAL SECURITY ARE AT RISK ON THE COMPETITIVENESS FRONT
AmoryLovins_2005 WE ALL KNOW THAT TOYOTA HAS MORE MARKET CAP THAN THE BIG THREE PUT TOGETHER AND SERIOUS COMPETITION FROM EUROPE FROM KOREA AND NEXT IS CHINA WHICH WILL SOON BE A MAJOR NET EXPORTER OF CARS HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WILL TAKE BEFORE YOU CAN DRIVE HOME YOUR NEW WALLY
AmoryLovins_2005 BADGED SHANGHAI AUTOMOTIVE SUPER EFFICIENT CAR
AmoryLovins_2005 MAYBE A DECADE ACCORDING TO MY FRIENDS IN DETROIT CHINA HAS AN ENERGY POLICY BASED ON RADICAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND LEAP FROG TECHNOLOGY THEY 'RE NOT GOING TO EXPORT YOUR UNCLE 'S BUICK AND AFTER THAT COMES INDIA THE POINT HERE IS THESE CARS ARE GOING TO BE MADE SUPER EFFICIENT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL MAKE THEM
AmoryLovins_2005 WILL WE IN THE UNITED STATES CONTINUE TO IMPORT EFFICIENT CARS TO REPLACE FOREIGN OIL OR WILL WE MAKE EFFICIENT CARS AND IMPORT NEITHER THE OIL NOR THE CARS THAT SEEMS TO MAKE MORE SENSE
AmoryLovins_2005 THE MORE WE KEEP ON USING THE OIL PARTICULARLY THE IMPORTED OIL THE MORE WE FACE A VERY OBVIOUS ARRAY OF PROBLEMS OUR ANALYSIS ASSUMES THAT THEY ALL COST NOTHING BUT NOTHING IS NOT THE RIGHT NUMBER IT COULD WELL BE ENOUGH TO DOUBLE THE OIL PRICE FOR EXAMPLE
AmoryLovins_2005 AND OUR MILITARY GET QUITE UNHAPPY WITH HAVING TO STAND GUARD ON PIPELINES IN FAR OFF ISTAN WHEN WHAT THEY ACTUALLY SIGNED UP FOR WAS TO PROTECT AMERICAN CITIZENS THEY DON 'T LIKE FIGHTING OVER OIL THEY DON 'T LIKE BEING IN THE SANDS
AmoryLovins_2005 AND THEY DON 'T LIKE WHERE THE OIL MONEY GOES AND WHAT SORT OF INSTABILITY IT CREATES
AmoryLovins_2005 NOW IN ORDER TO AVOID THESE PROBLEMS WHATEVER YOU THINK THEY 'RE WORTH IT 'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT COMPLICATED WE CAN SAVE HALF THE OIL BY USING IT MORE EFFICIENTLY AT A COST OF TWELVE DOLLARS PER SAVED BARREL
AmoryLovins_2005 AND THEN WE CAN REPLACE THE OTHER HALF
AmoryLovins_2005 WITH A COMBINATION OF ADVANCED BIO FUELS AND SAFE NATURAL GAS AND THAT COSTS ON AVERAGE UNDER EIGHTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL AND COMPARED WITH THE OFFICIAL FORECAST THAT OIL WILL COST TWENTY SIX DOLLARS A BARREL IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY FIVE WHICH IS HALF OF WHAT WE 'VE BEEN PAYING LATELY THAT WILL SAVE SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR STARTING QUITE SOON
AmoryLovins_2005 NOW IN ORDER TO DO THIS WE NEED TO INVEST ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY BILLION DOLLARS HALF OF IT TO RETOOL THE CAR TRUCK AND PLANE INDUSTRIES HALF OF IT TO BUILD THE ADVANCED BIO FUEL INDUSTRY IN THE PROCESS
AmoryLovins_2005 WE WILL GAIN ABOUT A MILLION GOOD JOBS MAINLY RURAL AND PROTECT ANOTHER MILLION JOBS NOW AT RISK MAINLY IN AUTO MAKING
AmoryLovins_2005 AND WE 'LL ALSO GET RETURNS OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR SO THAT 'S A VERY HANDSOME RETURN IT 'S FINANCEABLE IN THE PRIVATE CAPITAL MARKET BUT IF YOU WANT IT FOR THE REASONS I JUST MENTIONED TO HAPPEN SOONER AND WITH HIGHER CONFIDENCE
AmoryLovins_2005 THEN AND ALSO TO EXPAND CHOICE AND MANAGE RISK THEN YOU MIGHT LIKE SOME LIGHT HANDED PUBLIC POLICIES THAT SUPPORT RATHER THAN DISTORTING OR OPPOSING THE BUSINESS LOGIC
AmoryLovins_2005 WE FIGURED OUT WAYS TO DO THEM THAT DO NOT REQUIRE MUCH IF ANY FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND CAN INDEED BE DONE ADMINISTRATIVELY OR AT A STATE LEVEL JUST TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE NUB OF THE PROBLEM NAMELY LIGHT
AmoryLovins_2005 WITH LOW DRAG AND ALL BUT THE ONE AT THE UPPER LEFT HAVE HYBRID DRIVE YOU CAN SORT OF HAVE IT ALL WITH THESE THINGS FOR EXAMPLE THIS OPEL TWO SEATER DOES ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR AT NINETY FOUR MILES A GALLON
AmoryLovins_2005 THIS MUSCLE CAR FROM TOYOTA FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHT HORSEPOWER IN AN ULTRA LIGHT THAT DOES ZERO TO SIXTY IN WELL UNDER FOUR SECONDS AND STILL GETS THIRTY TWO MILES A GALLON
AmoryLovins_2005 WELL SAVING THAT FUEL SIXTY NINE PERCENT OF THE FUEL IN LIGHT VEHICLES COSTS ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN CENTS PER SAVED GALLON BUT IT 'S EVEN A BETTER DEAL FOR HEAVY TRUCKS WHERE YOU SAVE
AmoryLovins_2005 A SIMILAR AMOUNT AT TWENTY FIVE CENTS A GALLON WITH BETTER AERODYNAMICS AND TIRES AND ENGINES AND SO ON AND TAKING OUT WEIGHT SO YOU CAN PUT IT INTO PAYLOAD SO YOU CAN DOUBLE EFFICIENCY WITH A SIXTY PERCENT INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN
AmoryLovins_2005 THEN YOU CAN GO EVEN FURTHER ALMOST TRIPLING EFFICIENCY WITH SOME OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS DOUBLE THE BIG HAULERS MARGINS AND WE INTEND TO USE THOSE NUMBERS TO CREATE DEMAND PULL AND FLIP THE MARKET
AmoryLovins_2005 IN THE AIRPLANE BUSINESS IT 'S AGAIN A SIMILAR STORY WHERE THE FIRST TWENTY PERCENT FUEL SAVING IS FREE AS BOEING IS NOW DEMONSTRATING IN ITS NEW DREAMLINER BUT THEN THE NEXT GENERATION OF PLANES SAVES ABOUT HALF
AmoryLovins_2005 AGAIN MUCH CHEAPER THAN BUYING THE FUEL AND IF YOU GO OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS OR SO TO A BLENDED WING BODY KIND OF A FLYING WING WITH INTERNAL ENGINES THEN YOU GET ABOUT A FACTOR THREE EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT AT COMPARABLE OR LOWER COST
AmoryLovins_2005 LET ME FOCUS A MINUTE ON THE LIGHT VEHICLES THE CARS AND LIGHT TRUCKS BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THE MOST ABOUT THOSE PROBABLY EVERYBODY HERE DRIVES ONE
AmoryLovins_2005 AND YET WE MAY NOT REALIZE THAT IN A STANDARD SEDAN OF ALL THE FUEL ENERGY YOU FEED INTO THE CAR SEVEN EIGHTHS NEVER GETS TO THE WHEELS IT 'S LOST FIRST IN THE ENGINE IDLING AT ZERO MILES A GALLON THE POWER TRAIN AND ACCESSORIES
AmoryLovins_2005 SO THEN OF THE ENERGY THAT DOES GET TO THE WHEELS ONLY AN EIGHTH OF IT HALF OF THAT GOES TO HEAT THE TIRES ON THE ROAD OR TO HEAT THE AIR THE CAR PUSHES ASIDE AND ONLY THIS LITTLE BIT ONLY SIX
AmoryLovins_2005 THE ENTIRE CRASH ENERGY WOULD BE ABSORBED BY A COUPLE OF WOVEN CARBON FIBER COMPOSITE CONES WEIGHING A TOTAL OF FIFTEEN POUNDS HIDDEN IN THE FRONT END
AmoryLovins_2005 BECAUSE THESE MATERIALS COULD ACTUALLY ABSORB SIX TO TWELVE TIMES AS MUCH ENERGY PER POUND AS STEEL AND DO SO A LOT MORE SMOOTHLY
AmoryLovins_2005 BIGGER WHICH IS PROTECTIVE BUT MAKE THEM LIGHT WHEREAS IF WE MADE THEM HEAVY THEY 'D BE BOTH HOSTILE AND INEFFICIENT AND WHEN YOU MAKE THEM LIGHT IN THE RIGHT WAY THAT CAN BE SIMPLER AND CHEAPER TO MAKE YOU CAN END UP SAVING MONEY AND LIVES AND OIL ALL AT THE SAME TIME
AmoryLovins_2005 I SHOWED HERE TWO YEARS AGO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A DESIGN OF YOUR BASIC UNCOMPROMISED QUINTUPLED EFFICIENCY SUBURBAN ASSAULT VEHICLE
AmoryLovins_2005 STIFF STRONG CARBON COMPOSITE MATERIAL AND THEN WAYS TO THERMOFORM IT BECAUSE IT 'S A COMBINATION OF CARBON AND NYLON INTO WHATEVER COMPLEX SHAPES YOU WANT LIKE THE ONE JUST SHOWN AT THE AUTO SHOW BY ONE OF THE TIER ONE SUPPLIERS
AmoryLovins_2005 AND THE MANUFACTURING YOU CAN DO THIS WAY GETS RADICALLY SIMPLIFIED BECAUSE THE AUTO BODY HAS ONLY SAY FOURTEEN PARTS INSTEAD OF ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
AmoryLovins_2005 EACH ONE IS FORMED BY ONE FAIRLY CHEAP DIE SET INSTEAD OF FOUR EXPENSIVE ONES FOR STAMPING STEEL EACH OF THE PARTS CAN BE EASILY LIFTED WITH NO HOIST THEY SNAP TOGETHER LIKE A KID 'S TOY
AmoryLovins_2005 SO YOU GOT RID OF THE BODY SHOP AND IF YOU WANT YOU CAN LAY COLOR IN THE MOLD AND GET RID OF THE PAINT SHOP THOSE ARE THE TWO HARDEST AND COSTLIEST PARTS OF MAKING A CAR SO YOU END UP WITH AT LEAST TWO FIFTHS LOWER CAPITAL INTENSITY THAN THE LEANEST PLANT IN THE INDUSTRY WHICH GM HAS IN LANSING
AmoryLovins_2005 THE PLANT ALSO GETS SMALLER
AmoryLovins_2005 NOW WHEN YOU GO THROUGH A SIMILAR ANALYSIS FOR EVERY WAY WE USE OIL INCLUDING BUILDINGS INDUSTRY FEEDSTOCKS AND SO ON
AmoryLovins_2005 YOU FIND THAT OF THE TWENTY EIGHT MILLION BARRELS A DAY THE GOVERNMENT SAYS WE WILL NEED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY FIVE WELL ABOUT EIGHT OF THAT CAN BE REMOVED BY EFFICIENCY BY THEN WITH ANOTHER SEVEN STILL BEING SAVED AS THE VEHICLE STOCKS TURN OVER
AmoryLovins_2005 AT AN AVERAGE COST OF ONLY TWELVE BUCKS A BARREL INSTEAD OF TWENTY SIX FOR BUYING THE OIL AND THEN ANOTHER SIX
AmoryLovins_2005 CAN BE MADE ROBUSTLY COMPETITIVELY FROM CELLULOSIC ETHANOL AND A LITTLE BIO DIESEL WITHOUT INTERFERING AT ALL WITH THE WATER OR LAND NEEDS OF CROP PRODUCTION THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF GAS TO BE SAVED ABOUT HALF THE PROJECTED GAS AT ABOUT AN EIGHTH OF ITS PRICE
AmoryLovins_2005 AND HERE ARE SOME NO BRAINER SUBSTITUTIONS OF IT WITH LOTS LEFT OVER SO MUCH IN FACT THAT AFTER YOU 'VE
AmoryLovins_2005 FORECAST FROM AREAS ALREADY APPROVED YOU HAVE ONLY THIS LITTLE BIT LEFT AND LET 'S SEE HOW WE CAN MEET THAT BECAUSE THERE 'S A PRETTY FLEXIBLE MENU OF WAYS
AmoryLovins_2005 WE COULD OF COURSE BUY MORE EFFICIENCY MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO BUY EFFICIENCY AT TWENTY SIX BUCKS INSTEAD OF TWELVE
AmoryLovins_2005 OR WAIT TO CAPTURE THE SECOND HALF OF IT OR WE COULD OF COURSE JUST GET THIS LITTLE BIT BY CONTINUING TO IMPORT SOME CANADIAN AND MEXICAN OIL OR THE ETHANOL THE BRAZILIANS WOULD LOVE TO SELL US BUT THEY 'LL SELL IT TO JAPAN AND CHINA INSTEAD BECAUSE WE HAVE TARIFF BARRIERS TO PROTECT OUR CORN FARMERS AND THEY DON 'T
AmoryLovins_2005 OR WE COULD USE THE SAVED GAS DIRECTLY TO COVER ALL OF THIS BALANCE OR IF WE USED IT AS HYDROGEN WHICH IS MORE PROFITABLE AND EFFICIENT WE 'D GET RID OF THE DOMESTIC OIL TOO
AmoryLovins_2005 AND THAT DOESN 'T EVEN COUNT FOR EXAMPLE THAT AVAILABLE LAND IN THE DAKOTAS CAN COST EFFECTIVELY MAKE ENOUGH WIND POWER TO RUN EVERY HIGHWAY VEHICLE IN THE COUNTRY SO WE HAVE LOTS OF OPTIONS AND THE CHOICE OF MENU AND TIMING IS QUITE FLEXIBLE NOW TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN QUICKER AND WITH HIGHER CONFIDENCE THERE IS A FEW WAYS GOVERNMENT COULD HELP
AmoryLovins_2005 FOR EXAMPLE FEE BATES A COMBINATION OF A FEE AND A REBATE
AmoryLovins_2005 IN ANY SIZE CLASS OF VEHICLE YOU WANT
AmoryLovins_2005 CAN INCREASE THE PRICE OF INEFFICIENT VEHICLES AND CORRESPONDINGLY PAY YOU A REBATE FOR EFFICIENT VEHICLES YOU 'RE NOT PAID TO CHANGE SIZE CLASS YOU ARE PAID TO PICK EFFICIENCY WITHIN A SIZE CLASS IN A WAY EQUIVALENT TO LOOKING AT ALL FOURTEEN YEARS
AmoryLovins_2005 OF LIFE CYCLE FUEL SAVINGS RATHER THAN JUST THE FIRST TWO OR THREE THIS EXPANDS CHOICE RAPIDLY IN THE MARKET AND ACTUALLY MAKES MORE MONEY FOR AUTOMAKERS AS WELL
AmoryLovins_2005 I 'D LIKE TO DEAL WITH THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE PERSONAL MOBILITY IN THIS COUNTRY
AmoryLovins_2005 BY MAKING IT VERY CHEAPLY POSSIBLE FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES TO GET EFFICIENT RELIABLE WARRANTED NEW CARS THAT THEY COULD OTHERWISE NEVER GET AND FOR EACH CAR SO FINANCED SCRAP ALMOST ONE CLUNKER PREFERABLY THE DIRTIEST ONES THIS CREATES A NEW MILLION CAR A YEAR MARKET FOR DETROIT
AmoryLovins_2005 FROM CUSTOMERS THEY WEREN 'T GOING TO GET OTHERWISE BECAUSE THEY WEREN 'T CREDITWORTHY AND COULD NEVER AFFORD A NEW CAR AND DETROIT WILL MAKE MONEY ON EVERY UNIT IT TURNS OUT THAT IF SAY AFRICAN AMERICAN AND WHITE HOUSEHOLDS HAD THE SAME CAR OWNERSHIP
AmoryLovins_2005 IT WOULD CUT EMPLOYMENT DISPARITY ABOUT IN HALF BY PROVIDING BETTER ACCESS TO JOB OPPORTUNITIES SO THIS IS A HUGE SOCIAL WIN TOO GOVERNMENTS BUY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CARS A YEAR THERE ARE SMART WAYS TO BUY THEM AND TO AGGREGATE THAT PURCHASING POWER TO BRING VERY EFFICIENT VEHICLES INTO THE MARKET FASTER
AmoryLovins_2005 AND WE COULD EVEN DO AN X PRIZE STYLE GOLDEN CARROT THAT 'S WORTH STRETCHING FURTHER FOR FOR EXAMPLE A BILLION DOLLAR PRIZE FOR THE FIRST U S AUTOMAKER TO SELL TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND REALLY ADVANCED VEHICLES LIKE SOME YOU SAW EARLIER
AmoryLovins_2005 SO THAT IF THEY WERE OTHERWISE TO COME BACK IN THE AIR THEY WOULD WASTE MORE OIL AND BLOCK THE UPTAKE OF EFFICIENT NEW PLANES
AmoryLovins_2005 THEN THERE 'S AN IMPORTANT MILITARY ROLE THAT IN CREATING THE MOVE TO HIGH VOLUME LOW COST COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION OF THESE KINDS OF MATERIALS OR FOR THAT MATTER ULTRA LIGHT STEELS THAT ARE A GOOD BACKUP TECHNOLOGY
AmoryLovins_2005 THE MILITARY CAN DO THE TRICK IT DID IN TURNING DARPANET INTO THE INTERNET JUST TURN IT OVER TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND WE HAVE AN INTERNET THE SAME FOR GPS THE SAME FOR THE MODERN SEMI CONDUCTOR INDUSTRY THAT IS MILITARY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY NEED
AmoryLovins_2005 CAN CREATE THE ADVANCED MATERIALS INDUSTRIAL CLUSTER THAT TRANSFORMS ITS CIVILIAN ECONOMY AND GETS THE COUNTRY OFF OIL WHICH WOULD BE A HUGE CONTRIBUTION TO ELIMINATING CONFLICT OVER OIL AND ADVANCING NATIONAL AND GLOBAL SECURITY THEN WE NEED TO RETOOL
AmoryLovins_2005 THE CAR INDUSTRY AND DO RETRAINING AND SHIFT THE CONVERGENCE OF THE ENERGY AND AG VALUE CHAINS TO SHIFT FASTER FROM HYDROCARBONS TO CARBOHYDRATES AND GET OUT OF OUR OWN WAY IN OTHER WAYS
AmoryLovins_2005 AND MAKE THE TRANSITION TO MORE EFFICIENT VEHICLES GO FASTER BUT HERE 'S HOW THE WHOLE THING FITS TOGETHER
AmoryLovins_2005 ALL IMPLEMENTED AT SLOWER RATES THAN WE 'VE DONE BEFORE WHEN WE PAID ATTENTION AND IF WE START ADDING TRANCHES OF HYDROGEN IN THERE WE ARE RAPIDLY OFF IMPORTS AND COMPLETELY OFF OIL IN THE TWO THOUSAND AND FORTY S AND THE ONE THING I 'D LIKE TO POINT OUT HERE IS THAT WE 'VE DONE THIS BEFORE IN THIS EIGHT YEAR PERIOD ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN TO EIGHTY FIVE WHEN WE LAST PAID ATTENTION
AmoryLovins_2005 THE ECONOMY GREW TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OIL USE FELL SEVENTEEN PERCENT OIL IMPORTS FELL FIFTY PERCENT OIL IMPORTS FROM THE PERSIAN GULF FELL EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN GONE IF WE 'D KEPT THAT UP ONE MORE YEAR
AmoryLovins_2005 WELL THAT WAS WITH VERY OLD TECHNOLOGIES AND DELIVERY METHODS WE COULD RERUN THAT PLAY A LOT BETTER NOW AND YET WHAT WE PROVED THEN IS THE U S HAS MORE MARKET POWER THAN OPEC OURS IS ON THE DEMAND SIDE WE ARE THE SAUDI ARABIA OF NEGA BARRELS LAUGHTER WE CAN
AmoryLovins_2005 USE LESS OIL FASTER THAN THEY CAN CONVENIENTLY SELL LESS OIL APPLAUSE WHATEVER
