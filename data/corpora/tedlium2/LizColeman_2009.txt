LizColeman_2009 ARE NOT THE FIRST PEOPLE WHO COME TO MIND WHEN THE SUBJECT IS THE USES OF THE CREATIVE IMAGINATION SO I THOUGHT I'D START BY TELLING YOU HOW I GOT HERE
LizColeman_2009 THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REBUILD THEIR UNIVERSITIES SINCE EDUCATION UNDER THE SOVIET UNION WAS ESSENTIALLY PROPAGANDA SERVING THE PURPOSES OF A STATE
LizColeman_2009 THEY APPRECIATED THAT IT WOULD TAKE WHOLESALE TRANSFORMATIONS IF THEY WERE TO PROVIDE AN EDUCATION WORTHY OF FREE MEN AND WOMEN
LizColeman_2009 GIVEN THIS RARE OPPORTUNITY TO START FRESH THEY CHOSE LIBERAL ARTS AS THE MOST COMPELLING MODEL
LizColeman_2009 THEY SPOKE WITH A PASSION AN URGENCY AN INTELLECTUAL CONVICTION THAT FOR ME WAS A VOICE I HAD NOT HEARD IN DECADES
LizColeman_2009 A DREAM LONG FORGOTTEN FOR IN TRUTH WE HAD MOVED LIGHT YEARS FROM THE PASSIONS THAT ANIMATED THEM
LizColeman_2009 BUT FOR ME
LizColeman_2009 UNLIKE THEM IN MY WORLD THE SLATE WAS NOT CLEAN AND WHAT WAS WRITTEN
LizColeman_2009 ON IT WAS NOT ENCOURAGING IN TRUTH LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION NO LONGER EXISTS AT LEAST GENUINE LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION IN THIS COUNTRY
LizColeman_2009 WE HAVE PROFESSIONALIZED LIBERAL ARTS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY NO LONGER PROVIDE THE BREADTH OF
LizColeman_2009 AND THE ENHANCED CAPACITY FOR CIVIC ENGAGEMENT THAT IS THEIR SIGNATURE
LizColeman_2009 OVER THE PAST CENTURY THE EXPERT HAS DETHRONED THE EDUCATED GENERALIST TO BECOME THE SOLE MODEL OF INTELLECTUAL ACCOMPLISHMENT
LizColeman_2009 HAS
LizColeman_2009 HAD ITS MOMENTS BUT THE PRICE OF ITS DOMINANCE IS ENORMOUS SUBJECT MATTERS ARE BROKEN UP INTO SMALLER AND SMALLER PIECES
LizColeman_2009 WITH INCREASING EMPHASIS ON THE TECHNICAL AND THE OBSCURE WE HAVE EVEN MANAGED TO MAKE THE STUDY OF LITERATURE ARCANE
LizColeman_2009 YOU MAY THINK YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON IN THAT JANE AUSTEN NOVEL THAT IS UNTIL YOUR FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH POSTMODERN DECONSTRUCTIONISM
LizColeman_2009 THE PROGRESSION OF TODAY 'S COLLEGE STUDENT IS TO JETTISON EVERY INTEREST EXCEPT ONE
LizColeman_2009 AND WITHIN THAT ONE TO CONTINUALLY NARROW THE FOCUS LEARNING MORE AND MORE ABOUT LESS AND LESS
LizColeman_2009 THIS DESPITE THE EVIDENCE ALL AROUND US OF THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF THINGS LEST YOU THINK I EXAGGERATE HERE ARE THE BEGINNINGS OF THE A B CS OF ANTHROPOLOGY
LizColeman_2009 AS ONE MOVES UP THE LADDER VALUES OTHER THAN TECHNICAL COMPETENCE ARE VIEWED WITH INCREASING SUSPICION QUESTIONS SUCH AS
LizColeman_2009 WHAT KIND OF A WORLD ARE WE MAKING WHAT KIND OF A WORLD SHOULD WE BE MAKING WHAT KIND OF A WORLD CAN WE BE MAKING ARE TREATED WITH MORE
LizColeman_2009 AND MORE SKEPTICISM AND MOVE OFF THE TABLE IN SO DOING THE GUARDIANS OF SECULAR DEMOCRACY IN EFFECT
LizColeman_2009 YIELD THE CONNECTION BETWEEN EDUCATION AND VALUES TO FUNDAMENTALISTS WHO YOU CAN BE SURE
LizColeman_2009 HAVE NO COMPUNCTIONS ABOUT USING EDUCATION TO FURTHER THEIR VALUES THE ABSOLUTES OF A THEOCRACY MEANWHILE
LizColeman_2009 THE VALUES AND VOICES OF DEMOCRACY ARE SILENT EITHER WE HAVE LOST TOUCH WITH THOSE VALUES OR NO BETTER BELIEVE THEY NEED NOT OR CANNOT BE TAUGHT
LizColeman_2009 THIS AVERSION TO SOCIAL VALUES MAY SEEM AT ODDS WITH THE EXPLOSION OF COMMUNITY SERVICE PROGRAMS BUT DESPITE THE ATTENTION PAID TO THESE EFFORTS THEY REMAIN EMPHATICALLY EXTRACURRICULAR
LizColeman_2009 IN EFFECT CIVIC MINDEDNESS IS TREATED AS OUTSIDE THE REALM OF WHAT PURPORTS TO BE SERIOUS THINKING AND ADULT PURPOSES SIMPLY PUT
LizColeman_2009 WHEN THE IMPULSE IS TO CHANGE THE WORLD THE ACADEMY IS MORE LIKELY TO ENGENDER A LEARNED HELPLESSNESS THAN TO CREATE A SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT THIS BREW
LizColeman_2009 WHEN IT COMES TO PURSUING THE VITAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN EDUCATION AND THE PUBLIC GOOD BETWEEN INTELLECTUAL INTEGRITY AND HUMAN FREEDOM WHICH WERE AT THE HEART
LizColeman_2009 OF THE CHALLENGE POSED TO AND BY
LizColeman_2009 MY EUROPEAN COLLEAGUES WHEN THE ASTRONOMICAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THE REALITIES OF THE ACADEMY AND THE VISIONARY INTENSITY OF THIS CHALLENGE WERE MORE THAN ENOUGH I CAN ASSURE YOU TO GIVE ONE PAUSE
LizColeman_2009 WHAT WAS HAPPENING OUTSIDE HIGHER EDUCATION MADE BACKING OFF UNTHINKABLE WHETHER IT WAS THREATS TO THE ENVIRONMENT INEQUITIES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH
LizColeman_2009 LACK OF A SANE POLICY OR A SUSTAINABLE POLICY WITH RESPECT TO THE CONTINUING USES OF ENERGY WE WERE IN DESPERATE STRAITS AND THAT WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING
LizColeman_2009 THE CORRUPTING OF OUR POLITICAL LIFE HAD BECOME A LIVING NIGHTMARE NOTHING WAS EXEMPT
LizColeman_2009 A HARROWING PREDILECTION FOR THE USES OF FORCE HAD BECOME COMMONPLACE WITH AN EQUAL DISTASTE FOR THE ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF INFLUENCE AT THE SAME TIME
LizColeman_2009 ALL OF OUR FIREPOWER WAS IMPOTENT WHEN IT CAME TO HALTING OR EVEN STEMMING THE SLAUGHTER IN RWANDA DARFUR
LizColeman_2009 OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION ONCE A MODEL FOR THE WORLD HAS BECOME MOST NOTEWORTHY FOR ITS FAILURES
LizColeman_2009 DESPITE HAVING A RESEARCH ESTABLISHMENT THAT IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD MORE THAN HALF OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC DON'T BELIEVE IN EVOLUTION AND DON'T PRESS YOUR LUCK ABOUT HOW MUCH THOSE WHO DO BELIEVE IN IT ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND
LizColeman_2009 THIS NATION WITH
LizColeman_2009 ALL ITS MATERIAL INTELLECTUAL AND SPIRITUAL RESOURCES SEEMS UTTERLY HELPLESS
LizColeman_2009 TO REVERSE THE FREEFALL IN ANY OF THESE AREAS EQUALLY STARTLING FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IS THE
LizColeman_2009 THAT NO ONE WAS DRAWING ANY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE BODY POLITIC AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR LEADING EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
LizColeman_2009 WE MAY BE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST WHEN IT COMES TO INFLUENCING ACCESS TO PERSONAL WEALTH
LizColeman_2009 WE ARE NOT EVEN ON THE LIST WHEN IT COMES TO OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE HEALTH OF THIS DEMOCRACY WE ARE PLAYING WITH FIRE
LizColeman_2009 YOU CAN BE SURE JEFFERSON KNEW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE SAID IF A NATION EXPECTS TO BE IGNORANT AND FREE
LizColeman_2009 IN A STATE OF CIVILIZATION IT EXPECTS WHAT NEVER WAS AND NEVER WILL BE
LizColeman_2009 ON A MORE PERSONAL NOTE
LizColeman_2009 THIS BETRAYAL OF OUR PRINCIPLES OUR DECENCY OUR HOPE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO AVOID THE QUESTION
LizColeman_2009 WHAT WILL I SAY YEARS FROM NOW WHEN PEOPLE ASK WHERE WERE YOU AS PRESIDENT OF A LEADING LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE FAMOUS FOR ITS INNOVATIVE HISTORY THERE WERE NO EXCUSES
LizColeman_2009 SO THE CONVERSATION BEGAN AT BENNINGTON KNOWING THAT IF WE WERE TO REGAIN THE INTEGRITY OF LIBERAL EDUCATION IT WOULD TAKE RADICAL RETHINKING OF BASIC ASSUMPTIONS BEGINNING WITH OUR PRIORITIES
LizColeman_2009 OUR WAYS OF APPROACHING AGENCY AND AUTHORITY TURN INSIDE OUT TO REFLECT THE REALITY THAT NO ONE HAS THE ANSWERS TO THE CHALLENGES FACING CITIZENS IN THIS CENTURY
LizColeman_2009 AND EVERYONE HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRYING AND PARTICIPATING IN FINDING THEM
LizColeman_2009 BENNINGTON WOULD CONTINUE TO TEACH THE ARTS AND SCIENCES AS AREAS OF IMMERSION THAT ACKNOWLEDGE DIFFERENCES IN PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL OBJECTIVES BUT THE BALANCES REDRESSED
LizColeman_2009 OUR SHARED PURPOSES ASSUME AN EQUAL IF NOT GREATER IMPORTANCE WHEN THE DESIGN EMERGED IT WAS SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD
LizColeman_2009 THE IDEA IS TO MAKE THE POLITICAL SOCIAL CHALLENGES THEMSELVES FROM HEALTH AND EDUCATION TO THE USES OF FORCE THE ORGANIZERS OF THE CURRICULUM
LizColeman_2009 THEY WOULD ASSUME THE COMMANDING ROLE OF TRADITIONAL DISCIPLINES BUT STRUCTURES DESIGNED TO CONNECT RATHER THAN DIVIDE MUTUALLY DEPENDENT CIRCLES RATHER THAN ISOLATING
LizColeman_2009 AND THE POINT IS NOT TO TREAT THESE TOPICS AS TOPICS OF STUDY BUT AS FRAMEWORKS OF ACTION THE CHALLENGE
LizColeman_2009 TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING THAT MAKES A SIGNIFICANT AND SUSTAINABLE DIFFERENCE
LizColeman_2009 THE IMPORTANCE OF COMING TO GRIPS WITH VALUES LIKE JUSTICE EQUITY TRUTH BECOMES INCREASINGLY EVIDENT AS STUDENTS DISCOVER THAT INTEREST ALONE
LizColeman_2009 CANNOT TELL THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW WHEN THE ISSUE IS RETHINKING EDUCATION OUR APPROACH TO HEALTH
LizColeman_2009 OR STRATEGIES FOR ACHIEVING AN ECONOMICS OF EQUITY THE VALUE OF THE
LizColeman_2009 ALSO COMES ALIVE IT PROVIDES A LOT OF COMPANY YOU ARE NOT THE FIRST TO TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT
LizColeman_2009 JUST AS YOU ARE UNLIKELY TO BE THE LAST EVEN MORE VALUABLE
LizColeman_2009 AS WELL AS THE INTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF IDEAS IN THE LANGUAGE OF MY STUDENTS DEEP THOUGHT MATTERS WHEN YOU'RE CONTEMPLATING WHAT TO DO ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER
LizColeman_2009 A NEW LIBERAL ARTS THAT CAN SUPPORT THIS ACTION ORIENTED CURRICULUM HAS BEGUN TO EMERGE RHETORIC
LizColeman_2009 THE ART OF ORGANIZING THE WORLD OF WORDS TO MAXIMUM EFFECT DESIGN THE ART OF ORGANIZING THE WORLD OF THINGS
LizColeman_2009 AS IS A CAPACITY TO DISCRIMINATE SYSTEMATICALLY BETWEEN WHAT IS AT THE CORE AND WHAT IS AT THE PERIPHERY
LizColeman_2009 AND WHEN MAKING CONNECTIONS IS OF THE ESSENCE THE POWER OF TECHNOLOGY EMERGES WITH SPECIAL INTENSITY
LizColeman_2009 BUT SO DOES THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTENT THE MORE POWERFUL OUR REACH THE MORE IMPORTANT THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT
LizColeman_2009 WHEN IMPROVISATION RESOURCEFULNESS IMAGINATION ARE KEY ARTISTS AT LONG LAST TAKE THEIR PLACE AT THE TABLE WHEN STRATEGIES OF ACTION ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING
LizColeman_2009 IN THIS DRAMATICALLY EXPANDED IDEAL OF A LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION WHERE THE CONTINUUM OF THOUGHT AND ACTION IS ITS LIFE 'S BLOOD KNOWLEDGE HONED OUTSIDE THE ACADEMY BECOMES ESSENTIAL
LizColeman_2009 SOCIAL ACTIVISTS BUSINESS LEADERS LAWYERS POLITICIANS PROFESSIONALS WILL JOIN THE FACULTY AS ACTIVE AND ONGOING PARTICIPANTS
LizColeman_2009 IN THIS WEDDING OF LIBERAL EDUCATION TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE PUBLIC GOOD STUDENTS IN TURN CONTINUOUSLY MOVE OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM TO ENGAGE THE WORLD DIRECTLY
LizColeman_2009 AND OF COURSE THIS NEW WINE NEEDS NEW BOTTLES IF WE ARE TO CAPTURE THE LIVELINESS AND DYNAMISM OF THIS IDEA
LizColeman_2009 THE MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERY WE MADE IN OUR FOCUS ON PUBLIC ACTION WAS TO APPRECIATE THAT THE HARD CHOICES ARE NOT BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL
LizColeman_2009 BUT BETWEEN COMPETING GOODS THIS DISCOVERY IS TRANSFORMING IT UNDERCUTS SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS RADICALLY ALTERS THE TONE AND CHARACTER OF CONTROVERSY
LizColeman_2009 AND ENRICHES DRAMATICALLY THE POSSIBILITIES FOR FINDING COMMON GROUND IDEOLOGY ZEALOTRY UNSUBSTANTIATED OPINIONS SIMPLY
LizColeman_2009 THIS IS A POLITICAL EDUCATION TO BE SURE
LizColeman_2009 BUT IT IS A POLITICS OF PRINCIPLE NOT OF PARTISANSHIP SO THE CHALLENGE FOR BENNINGTON IS TO DO IT
LizColeman_2009 ON THE COVER OF BENNINGTON 'S TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT HOLIDAY CARD IS THE ARCHITECT 'S SKETCH OF A BUILDING OPENING IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THAT IS TO BE A CENTER FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF PUBLIC ACTION
LizColeman_2009 WILL EMBODY AND SUSTAIN THIS NEW EDUCATIONAL COMMITMENT THINK OF IT AS A KIND OF SECULAR CHURCH THE WORDS ON THE CARD DESCRIBE WHAT WILL HAPPEN INSIDE
LizColeman_2009 WE INTEND TO TURN THE INTELLECTUAL AND IMAGINATIVE POWER PASSION AND
LizColeman_2009 OF OUR STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF
LizColeman_2009 TO DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR ACTING ON THE CRITICAL CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME
LizColeman_2009 SO WE ARE DOING OUR JOB
LizColeman_2009 WHILE THESE PAST WEEKS HAVE BEEN A TIME OF NATIONAL EXHILARATION IN THIS COUNTRY IT WOULD BE TRAGIC IF YOU THOUGHT THIS MEANT YOUR JOB WAS
LizColeman_2009 THE GLACIAL SILENCE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THE FACE OF THE SHREDDING OF THE CONSTITUTION THE UNRAVELING OF OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS
LizColeman_2009 THE DETERIORATION OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT LIMITED TO THE UNIVERSITIES WE THE PEOPLE
LizColeman_2009 HAVE BECOME INURED TO OUR OWN IRRELEVANCE WHEN IT COMES TO DOING ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT ABOUT ANYTHING THAT MATTERS CONCERNING GOVERNANCE BEYOND WAITING ANOTHER FOUR YEARS
LizColeman_2009 WE PERSIST ALSO IN BEING SIDELINED BY THE IDEA OF THE EXPERT AS THE ONLY ONE CAPABLE OF COMING UP WITH ANSWERS DESPITE THE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY
LizColeman_2009 THE PROBLEM IS THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A VIABLE DEMOCRACY MADE UP OF EXPERTS ZEALOTS POLITICIANS AND SPECTATORS
LizColeman_2009 AND THERE WILL BE AND SHOULD BE THOSE WHO SPEND A LIFETIME PURSUING A VERY HIGHLY DEFINED AREA
LizColeman_2009 BUT THIS SINGLEMINDEDNESS WILL NOT YIELD THE FLEXIBILITIES OF MIND THE MULTIPLICITY OF PERSPECTIVES
LizColeman_2009 THE CAPACITIES FOR COLLABORATION AND INNOVATION THIS COUNTRY NEEDS THAT IS WHERE YOU COME IN WHAT IS CERTAIN
LizColeman_2009 IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL TALENT EXHIBITED IN SUCH ABUNDANCE HERE NEEDS TO TURN ITS ATTENTION TO THAT COLLABORATIVE MESSY
LizColeman_2009 FRUSTRATING CONTENTIOUS AND IMPOSSIBLE WORLD OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC POLICY PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HIS TEAM SIMPLY CAN NOT DO IT ALONE
LizColeman_2009 IF THE QUESTION OF WHERE TO START SEEMS OVERWHELMING YOU ARE AT THE BEGINNING NOT THE END OF THIS ADVENTURE BEING OVERWHELMED IS THE FIRST STEP
LizColeman_2009 IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT TRYING TO GET AT THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER ON A SCALE THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE
LizColeman_2009 SO WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU FEEL OVERWHELMED
LizColeman_2009 WELL YOU HAVE TWO THINGS YOU HAVE A MIND AND YOU HAVE OTHER PEOPLE
LizColeman_2009 START WITH THOSE AND CHANGE THE WORLD
