AlGore_2009 LAST YEAR I SHOWED THESE TWO SLIDES SO THAT DEMONSTRATE THAT THE ARCTIC ICE CAP WHICH FOR MOST OF THE LAST THREE MILLION YEARS HAS BEEN THE SIZE OF THE LOWER FORTY EIGHT STATES HAS SHRUNK BY FORTY PERCENT
AlGore_2009 BUT THIS UNDERSTATES THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM BECAUSE IT DOESN 'T SHOW THE THICKNESS OF THE ICE THE ARCTIC ICE CAP IS IN A SENSE THE BEATING HEART OF THE GLOBAL CLIMATE SYSTEM IT EXPANDS IN WINTER AND CONTRACTS IN SUMMER THE NEXT SLIDE I SHOW YOU WILL BE
AlGore_2009 A RAPID FAST FORWARD OF WHAT 'S HAPPENED OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE PERMANENT ICE IS MARKED IN RED AND AS YOU SEE IT EXPANDS TO THE DARK BLUE THAT 'S THE ANNUAL ICE IN WINTER AND IT CONTRACTS IN SUMMER
AlGore_2009 AND THE SO CALLED PERMANENT ICE FIVE YEARS OLD OR OLDER YOU CAN SEE IS ALMOST LIKE BLOOD SPILLING OUT OF THE BODY HERE

AlGore_2009 IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS IT 'S GONE FROM THIS TO THIS THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE WARMING
AlGore_2009 HEATS UP THE FROZEN GROUND AROUND THE ARCTIC OCEAN WHERE THERE IS A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF FROZEN CARBON WHICH WHEN IT THAWS IS TURNED INTO METHANE BY MICROBES COMPARED TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTION IN THE ATMOSPHERE THAT AMOUNT COULD DOUBLE IF WE CROSS THIS TIPPING POINT
AlGore_2009 ALREADY IN SOME SHALLOW LAKES IN ALASKA METHANE IS ACTIVELY BUBBLING UP OUT OF THE WATER PROFESSOR KATEY WALTER FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA WENT OUT WITH ANOTHER TEAM TO ANOTHER SHALLOW LAKE LAST WINTER
AlGore_2009 IGNORE_TIME_SEGMENT_IN_SCORING
AlGore_2009 SHE 'S OKAY THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE WILL BE AND ONE REASON IS THIS ENORMOUS HEAT SINK HEATS UP GREENLAND FROM THE NORTH
AlGore_2009 THIS IS AN ANNUAL MELTING RIVER BUT THE VOLUMES ARE MUCH LARGER THAN EVER THIS IS THE KANGERLUSSUAQ RIVER IN SOUTHWEST
AlGore_2009 GREENLAND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW SEA LEVEL RISES FROM LAND BASE ICE MELTING THIS IS WHERE IT REACHES THE SEA THESE FLOWS ARE INCREASING VERY RAPIDLY
AlGore_2009 AT THE OTHER END OF THE PLANET ANTARCTICA THE LARGEST MASS OF ICE ON THE PLANET LAST MONTH SCIENTISTS REPORTED THE ENTIRE CONTINENT IS NOW IN NEGATIVE ICE BALANCE AND WEST ANTARCTICA
AlGore_2009 CROPPED UP ON TOP SOME UNDER SEA ISLANDS IS PARTICULARLY RAPID IN ITS MELTING THAT 'S EQUAL TO TWENTY FEET OF SEA LEVEL AS IS GREENLAND
AlGore_2009 IN THE HIMALAYAS THE THIRD LARGEST MASS OF ICE AT THE TOP YOU SEE NEW LAKES WHICH A FEW YEARS AGO WERE GLACIERS FORTY PERCENT OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD GET HALF OF THEIR DRINKING WATER FROM THAT MELTING FLOW IN THE ANDES THIS GLACIER IS THE SOURCE OF DRINKING WATER FOR THIS CITY
AlGore_2009 THE FLOWS HAVE INCREASED BUT WHEN THEY GO AWAY SO DOES MUCH OF THE DRINKING WATER IN CALIFORNIA THERE HAS BEEN A FORTY PERCENT DECLINE IN THE SIERRA SNOWPACK THIS IS HITTING THE RESERVOIRS AND THE PREDICTIONS AS YOU 'VE READ ARE SERIOUS THIS DRYING AROUND THE WORLD HAS LEAD TO A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN FIRES
AlGore_2009 AND THE DISASTERS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEEN INCREASING AT AN ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY AND UNPRECEDENTED RATE FOUR TIMES AS MANY IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS AS IN THE PREVIOUS SEVENTY FIVE THIS IS A COMPLETELY UNSUSTAINABLE PATTERN IF YOU LOOK AT IN THE CONTEXT OF HISTORY YOU CAN SEE
AlGore_2009 WHAT THIS IS DOING
AlGore_2009 IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE 'VE ADDED SEVENTY MILLION TONS OF CO TWO EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS TWENTY FIVE MILLION TONS EVERY DAY TO THE OCEANS
AlGore_2009 LOOK CAREFULLY AT THE AREA OF THE EASTERN PACIFIC FROM THE AMERICAS EXTENDING WESTWARD AND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT WHERE THERE IS A RADICAL DEPLETION OF OXYGEN IN THE OCEANS
AlGore_2009 THE BIGGEST SINGLE CAUSE OF GLOBAL WARMING ALONG WITH DEFORESTATION WHICH IS TWENTY PERCENT OF IT IS THE BURNING OF FOSSIL FUELS OIL IS A PROBLEM
AlGore_2009 AND COAL IS THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM THE UNITED STATES IS ONE OF THE TWO LARGEST EMITTERS ALONG WITH CHINA AND THE PROPOSAL HAS BEEN TO BUILD A LOT MORE COAL PLANTS BUT WE 'RE BEGINNING TO SEE A SEA CHANGE HERE ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WITH SOME GREEN ALTERNATIVES PROPOSED
AlGore_2009 HOWEVER THERE IS A POLITICAL BATTLE IN OUR COUNTRY AND THE COAL INDUSTRIES AND THE OIL INDUSTRIES SPENT A QUARTER OF A BILLION DOLLARS IN THE LAST CALENDAR YEAR PROMOTING CLEAN COAL WHICH IS AN OXYMORON THAT IMAGE REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING
