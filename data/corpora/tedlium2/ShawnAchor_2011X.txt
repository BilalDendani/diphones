ShawnAchor_2011X AND SAW THAT SHE HAD LANDED PAINFULLY ON HER HANDS AND KNEES ON ALL FOURS ON THE GROUND I WAS NERVOUS BECAUSE MY PARENTS HAD CHARGED ME
ShawnAchor_2011X WITH MAKING SURE THAT MY SISTER AND I PLAYED
ShawnAchor_2011X AS SAFELY AND AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE AND SEEING AS HOW I HAD ACCIDENTALLY BROKEN AMY 'S ARM JUST
ShawnAchor_2011X ONE WEEK BEFORE
ShawnAchor_2011X HEROICALLY PUSHING HER OUT OF THE WAY OF AN ONCOMING IMAGINARY SNIPER BULLET
ShawnAchor_2011X SO I DID THE ONLY THING MY LITTLE FRANTIC SEVEN YEAR OLD BRAIN COULD THINK TO DO TO AVERT THIS TRAGEDY AND IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN YOU 'VE SEEN THIS HUNDREDS OF TIMES BEFORE I SAID AMY AMY WAIT DON 'T CRY DON 'T CRY DID YOU SEE HOW YOU LANDED
ShawnAchor_2011X NO HUMAN LANDS ON ALL FOURS LIKE THAT
ShawnAchor_2011X AND YOU COULD SEE HOW MY POOR MANIPULATED SISTER FACED CONFLICT
ShawnAchor_2011X AS HER LITTLE BRAIN ATTEMPTED TO DEVOTE RESOURCES TO FEELING THE PAIN AND SUFFERING AND SURPRISE SHE JUST EXPERIENCED OR CONTEMPLATING HER NEW FOUND IDENTITY AS A UNICORN
ShawnAchor_2011X AND THE LATTER WON OUT INSTEAD OF CRYING INSTEAD OF CEASING OUR PLAY INSTEAD OF WAKING MY PARENTS WITH ALL THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THAT WOULD HAVE ENSUED FOR ME INSTEAD A SMILE SPREAD ACROSS HER FACE AND SHE SCRAMBLED RIGHT BACK UP ONTO THE BUNK BED WITH ALL THE GRACE OF A BABY UNICORN
ShawnAchor_2011X WITH ONE BROKEN LEG WHAT WE STUMBLED ACROSS
ShawnAchor_2011X AT THIS TENDER AGE OF JUST FIVE AND SEVEN WE HAD NO IDEA AT THE TIME WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING BE AT THE VANGUARD OF A SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION OCCURRING TWO DECADES LATER IN THE WAY THAT WE LOOK AT THE HUMAN BRAIN WHAT WE HAD STUMBLED ACROSS IS SOMETHING CALLED POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY WHICH IS THE REASON THAT I 'M HERE TODAY AND THE REASON THAT I WAKE UP EVERY MORNING
ShawnAchor_2011X WHEN I FIRST STARTED TALKING ABOUT THIS RESEARCH OUTSIDE OF ACADEMIA OUT WITH COMPANIES AND SCHOOLS THE VERY FIRST THING THEY SAID TO NEVER DO IS TO START YOUR TALK WITH A GRAPH
ShawnAchor_2011X THE VERY FIRST THING I WANT TO DO IS START MY TALK WITH A GRAPH THIS GRAPH LOOKS BORING BUT THIS GRAPH IS THE REASON I GET EXCITED AND WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AND THIS GRAPH DOESN 'T EVEN MEAN ANYTHING IT 'S FAKE DATA WHAT WE FOUND
ShawnAchor_2011X IF I GOT THIS DATA BACK STUDYING YOU HERE IN THE ROOM I WOULD BE THRILLED BECAUSE THERE 'S VERY CLEARLY A TREND THAT 'S GOING ON THERE AND THAT MEANS THAT I CAN GET PUBLISHED WHICH IS ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS THE FACT THAT THERE 'S ONE WEIRD RED DOT THAT 'S UP ABOVE THE CURVE THERE 'S ONE WEIRDO IN THE ROOM I KNOW WHO YOU ARE I SAW YOU EARLIER
ShawnAchor_2011X NO PROBLEM THAT 'S NO PROBLEM AS MOST OF YOU KNOW BECAUSE
ShawnAchor_2011X I CAN JUST DELETE THAT DOT I CAN DELETE THAT DOT BECAUSE THAT 'S CLEARLY A MEASUREMENT ERROR AND WE KNOW THAT 'S A MEASUREMENT ERROR BECAUSE IT 'S MESSING UP MY DATA
ShawnAchor_2011X THE VERY FIRST THINGS WE TEACH PEOPLE IN ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS AND BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY COURSES IS HOW IN A STATISTICALLY VALID WAY DO WE ELIMINATE THE WEIRDOS HOW DO WE ELIMINATE
ShawnAchor_2011X SCIENTISTS CHANGE THE ANSWER TO HOW FAST DOES THE AVERAGE CHILD LEARN HOW TO READ IN THAT CLASSROOM AND THEN WE TAILOR THE CLASS RIGHT TOWARDS THE AVERAGE NOW IF YOU FALL BELOW THE AVERAGE ON THIS CURVE THEN PSYCHOLOGISTS GET THRILLED BECAUSE THAT MEANS YOU 'RE EITHER DEPRESSED OR YOU HAVE A DISORDER OR HOPEFULLY BOTH
ShawnAchor_2011X WE 'RE HOPING FOR BOTH BECAUSE OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS IF YOU COME INTO A THERAPY SESSION WITH ONE PROBLEM WE WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE KNOWING YOU HAVE TEN SO YOU KEEP COMING BACK OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE 'LL GO BACK INTO YOUR CHILDHOOD IF NECESSARY BUT EVENTUALLY WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE YOU NORMAL AGAIN
ShawnAchor_2011X BUT NORMAL IS MERELY AVERAGE AND WHAT I POSIT AND WHAT POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY POSITS IS THAT IF WE STUDY WHAT IS MERELY AVERAGE WE WILL REMAIN MERELY AVERAGE
ShawnAchor_2011X WHY IS IT THAT SOME OF YOU ARE SO HIGH ABOVE THE CURVE
ShawnAchor_2011X IN TERMS OF YOUR INTELLECTUAL ABILITY ATHLETIC ABILITY MUSICAL ABILITY CREATIVITY ENERGY LEVELS YOUR RESILIENCY IN THE FACE OF CHALLENGE YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR WHATEVER IT IS INSTEAD OF DELETING YOU WHAT I WANT TO DO IS STUDY YOU BECAUSE MAYBE WE CAN GLEAN INFORMATION NOT JUST HOW TO MOVE PEOPLE UP TO THE AVERAGE BUT HOW WE CAN MOVE THE ENTIRE AVERAGE UP
ShawnAchor_2011X WHAT THAT 'S DOING IS CREATING SOMETHING CALLED THE MEDICAL SCHOOL SYNDROME WHICH IF YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO 'VE BEEN TO MEDICAL SCHOOL DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF MEDICAL TRAINING AS YOU READ THROUGH A LIST OF ALL THE SYMPTOMS AND DISEASES THAT COULD HAPPEN SUDDENLY YOU REALIZE YOU HAVE ALL OF THEM
ShawnAchor_2011X BROTHER IN LAW NAMED BOBO WHICH IS A WHOLE OTHER STORY
ShawnAchor_2011X THE
ShawnAchor_2011X WHEN I APPLIED TO HARVARD I APPLIED ON A DARE I DIDN 'T EXPECT TO GET IN AND MY FAMILY HAD NO MONEY FOR COLLEGE WHEN I GOT A MILITARY SCHOLARSHIP TWO WEEKS LATER THEY ALLOWED ME TO GO SUDDENLY SOMETHING THAT WASN 'T EVEN A POSSIBILITY BECAME A REALITY
ShawnAchor_2011X WHEN I WENT THERE I ASSUMED EVERYONE ELSE WOULD SEE IT AS A PRIVILEGE AS WELL THAT THEY 'D BE EXCITED TO BE THERE EVEN IF YOU 'RE IN A CLASSROOM FULL OF PEOPLE SMARTER THAN YOU YOU 'D BE HAPPY JUST TO BE IN THAT CLASSROOM WHICH IS WHAT I FELT BUT WHAT I FOUND THERE IS WHILE SOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCE THAT WHEN I GRADUATED AFTER MY FOUR YEARS AND THEN SPENT THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS
ShawnAchor_2011X I WAS AN OFFICER OF HARVARD TO COUNSEL STUDENTS THROUGH THE DIFFICULT FOUR YEARS AND WHAT I FOUND IN MY RESEARCH AND MY TEACHING IS THAT THESE STUDENTS NO MATTER HOW HAPPY THEY WERE WITH THEIR ORIGINAL SUCCESS OF GETTING INTO THE SCHOOL TWO WEEKS LATER THEIR BRAINS WERE FOCUSED NOT ON THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING THERE NOR ON THEIR PHILOSOPHY OR THEIR PHYSICS THEIR BRAIN WAS FOCUSED ON THE COMPETITION THE WORKLOAD THE HASSLES THE STRESSES THE COMPLAINTS
ShawnAchor_2011X WHEN I FIRST WENT IN THERE I WALKED INTO THE FRESHMEN DINING HALL WHICH IS WHERE MY FRIENDS FROM WACO TEXAS WHICH IS WHERE I GREW UP I KNOW SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD OF IT WHEN THEY 'D COME TO VISIT ME THEY 'D LOOK AROUND THEY 'D SAY THIS FRESHMAN DINING HALL LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF HOGWART 'S FROM THE MOVIE HARRY POTTER WHICH IT DOES
ShawnAchor_2011X WHAT DOES A HARVARD STUDENT POSSIBLY HAVE TO BE UNHAPPY ABOUT
ShawnAchor_2011X EMBEDDED WITHIN THAT QUESTION IS THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE SCIENCE OF HAPPINESS BECAUSE WHAT THAT QUESTION ASSUMES
ShawnAchor_2011X IS THAT OUR EXTERNAL WORLD IS PREDICTIVE OF OUR HAPPINESS LEVELS WHEN IN REALITY IF I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOUR EXTERNAL WORLD I CAN ONLY PREDICT TEN PERCENT OF YOUR LONG TERM HAPPINESS
ShawnAchor_2011X NINETY PERCENT OF YOUR LONG TERM HAPPINESS IS PREDICTED NOT BY THE EXTERNAL WORLD BUT BY THE WAY YOUR BRAIN PROCESSES THE WORLD AND IF WE CHANGE IT IF WE CHANGE OUR FORMULA FOR HAPPINESS AND SUCCESS WHAT WE CAN DO IS CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE CAN THEN AFFECT REALITY
ShawnAchor_2011X I 'M GLAD YOU LIKED BUT THEY DID NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL SILENCE ON THE PHONE AND INTO THE SILENCE
ShawnAchor_2011X I SAID I 'D BE HAPPY TO SPEAK AT YOUR SCHOOL BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW THAT 'S NOT A WELLNESS WEEK THAT 'S A SICKNESS WEEK WHAT YOU 'VE DONE IS YOU 'VE OUTLINED ALL THE NEGATIVE THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN BUT NOT TALKED ABOUT THE POSITIVE THE ABSENCE OF DISEASE IS NOT HEALTH HERE 'S HOW WE GET TO HEALTH WE NEED TO REVERSE THE FORMULA FOR HAPPINESS AND SUCCESS
ShawnAchor_2011X IN THE LAST THREE YEARS I 'VE TRAVELED TO FORTY FIVE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WORKING WITH SCHOOLS AND COMPANIES IN THE MIDST OF AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND WHAT I FOUND IS THAT MOST COMPANIES AND SCHOOLS FOLLOW A FORMULA FOR SUCCESS WHICH IS THIS IF I WORK HARDER I 'LL BE MORE SUCCESSFUL
ShawnAchor_2011X AND IF I 'M MORE SUCCESSFUL THEN I 'LL BE HAPPIER
ShawnAchor_2011X THAT UNDERGIRDS MOST OF OUR PARENTING STYLES OUR MANAGING STYLES THE WAY THAT WE MOTIVATE OUR BEHAVIOR AND THE PROBLEM IS IT 'S SCIENTIFICALLY BROKEN AND BACKWARDS FOR TWO REASONS
ShawnAchor_2011X FIRST EVERY TIME YOUR BRAIN HAS A SUCCESS YOU JUST CHANGED THE GOALPOST OF WHAT SUCCESS LOOKED LIKE YOU GOT GOOD GRADES NOW YOU HAVE TO GET BETTER GRADES YOU GOT INTO A GOOD SCHOOL AND AFTER YOU GET INTO A BETTER SCHOOL YOU GOT A GOOD JOB NOW YOU HAVE TO GET A BETTER JOB YOU HIT YOUR SALES TARGET WE 'RE GOING TO CHANGE YOUR SALES TARGET AND IF HAPPINESS IS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF SUCCESS YOUR BRAIN NEVER GETS THERE
ShawnAchor_2011X WHAT WE 'VE DONE IS WE 'VE PUSHED HAPPINESS OVER THE COGNITIVE HORIZON AS A SOCIETY
ShawnAchor_2011X AND THAT 'S BECAUSE WE THINK WE HAVE TO BE SUCCESSFUL THEN WE 'LL BE HAPPIER BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS OUR BRAINS WORK IN THE OPPOSITE ORDER IF YOU CAN RAISE SOMEBODY 'S LEVEL OF POSITIVITY IN THE PRESENT
ShawnAchor_2011X THEN THEIR BRAIN EXPERIENCES WHAT WE NOW CALL A HAPPINESS ADVANTAGE WHICH IS YOUR BRAIN AT POSITIVE
ShawnAchor_2011X PERFORMS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN IT DOES AT NEGATIVE NEUTRAL OR STRESSED YOUR INTELLIGENCE RISES YOUR CREATIVITY RISES YOUR ENERGY LEVELS RISE IN FACT WHAT WE 'VE FOUND IS THAT EVERY SINGLE BUSINESS OUTCOME IMPROVES
ShawnAchor_2011X YOUR BRAIN AT POSITIVE IS THIRTY ONE PERCENT MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN YOUR BRAIN AT NEGATIVE NEUTRAL OR STRESSED YOU 'RE THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT BETTER AT SALES DOCTORS ARE NINETEEN PERCENT FASTER MORE ACCURATE AT COMING UP WITH THE CORRECT DIAGNOSIS WHEN POSITIVE INSTEAD OF NEGATIVE NEUTRAL OR STRESSED WHICH MEANS WE CAN REVERSE THE FORMULA
ShawnAchor_2011X IF WE CAN FIND A WAY OF BECOMING POSITIVE IN THE PRESENT THEN OUR BRAINS WORK EVEN MORE SUCCESSFULLY AS WE 'RE ABLE TO WORK
ShawnAchor_2011X HARDER FASTER AND MORE INTELLIGENTLY
ShawnAchor_2011X WHAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO IS TO REVERSE THIS FORMULA SO WE CAN START TO SEE WHAT OUR BRAINS ARE ACTUALLY CAPABLE OF BECAUSE DOPAMINE WHICH FLOODS INTO YOUR SYSTEM WHEN YOU 'RE POSITIVE HAS TWO FUNCTIONS
ShawnAchor_2011X DONE FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS IN A ROW WE CAN ACTUALLY REWIRE YOUR BRAIN ALLOWING YOUR BRAIN TO ACTUALLY WORK MORE OPTIMISTICALLY AND MORE SUCCESSFULLY
ShawnAchor_2011X JOURNALING ABOUT ONE POSITIVE EXPERIENCE YOU 'VE HAD OVER THE PAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS ALLOWS YOUR BRAIN TO RELIVE IT EXERCISE TEACHES YOUR BRAIN THAT YOUR BEHAVIOR MATTERS WE FIND THAT MEDITATION ALLOWS YOUR BRAIN TO GET OVER THE CULTURAL ADHD THAT WE 'VE BEEN CREATING BY TRYING TO DO MULTIPLE TASKS AT ONCE AND ALLOWS OUR BRAINS TO FOCUS ON THE TASK AT HAND AND FINALLY
ShawnAchor_2011X RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS ARE CONSCIOUS ACTS OF KINDNESS WE GET PEOPLE WHEN THEY OPEN UP THEIR INBOX TO WRITE ONE POSITIVE EMAIL PRAISING OR THANKING SOMEBODY IN THEIR SOCIAL SUPPORT NETWORK AND BY DOING THESE ACTIVITIES AND BY TRAINING YOUR BRAIN JUST LIKE WE TRAIN OUR BODIES WHAT WE 'VE FOUND IS WE CAN REVERSE THE FORMULA FOR HAPPINESS AND SUCCESS AND IN DOING SO NOT ONLY CREATE RIPPLES OF POSITIVITY BUT CREATE A REAL REVOLUTION
