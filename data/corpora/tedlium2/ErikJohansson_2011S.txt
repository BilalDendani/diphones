ErikJohansson_2011S@16.23:20.74 'M HERE TO SHARE MY PHOTOGRAPHY OR
ErikJohansson_2011S@20.94:23.48 IS IT PHOTOGRAPHY BECAUSE OF COURSE
ErikJohansson_2011S@23.59:26.42 THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPH THAT YOU CAN 'T TAKE WITH YOUR CAMERA
ErikJohansson_2011S@27.28:37.93 YET MY INTEREST IN PHOTOGRAPHY STARTED AS I GOT MY FIRST DIGITAL CAMERA AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN IT MIXED WITH MY EARLIER PASSION FOR DRAWING BUT IT WAS A BIT DIFFERENT
ErikJohansson_2011S@49.11:64.57 SO TO ME IT FELT LIKE PHOTOGRAPHY WAS MORE ABOUT BEING AT THE RIGHT PLACE AND THE RIGHT TIME I FELT LIKE ANYONE COULD DO THAT SO I WANTED TO CREATE SOMETHING DIFFERENT SOMETHING WHERE THE PROCESS STARTS WHEN YOU PRESS THE TRIGGER
ErikJohansson_2011S@65.07:66.72 PHOTOS LIKE THIS
ErikJohansson_2011S@81.54:92.25 BOTH DARK AND COLORFUL BUT ALL WITH A COMMON GOAL OF RETAINING THE LEVEL OF REALISM WHEN I SAY REALISM I MEAN PHOTO REALISM BECAUSE OF COURSE
ErikJohansson_2011S@93.49:97.3 IT 'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN CAPTURE REALLY BUT
ErikJohansson_2011S@97.38:100.93 I ALWAYS WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE IT COULD HAVE BEEN CAPTURED SOMEHOW AS A PHOTOGRAPH
ErikJohansson_2011S@119.86:121.58 IS IT SOMETHING ABOUT THE LIGHT
ErikJohansson_2011S@122.75:125.07 WHAT CREATES THE ILLUSION
ErikJohansson_2011S@125.11:127.56 SOMETIMES
ErikJohansson_2011S@139.68:145.17 WHAT WE THINK LOOKS REALISTIC REALLY SO I THINK THE BASICS ARE QUITE SIMPLE
ErikJohansson_2011S@156.77:161.32 HERE WE HAVE THREE PERFECTLY IMAGINABLE PHYSICAL OBJECTS
ErikJohansson_2011S@161.76:167.41 SOMETHING WE ALL CAN RELATE TO LIVING IN A THREE DIMENSIONAL WORLD BUT COMBINED IN A CERTAIN WAY
ErikJohansson_2011S@167.45:172.98 THEY CAN CREATE SOMETHING THAT STILL LOOKS THREE DIMENSIONAL LIKE IT COULD EXIST
ErikJohansson_2011S@174.03:176.37 BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW IT CAN 'T
ErikJohansson_2011S@176.85:183.71 SO WE TRICK OUR BRAINS BECAUSE OUR BRAIN SIMPLY DOESN 'T ACCEPT THE FACT THAT IT DOESN 'T REALLY MAKE SENSE
ErikJohansson_2011S@196.65:200.27 I THINK IT 'S THE THINGS THAT WE DON 'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THE THINGS
ErikJohansson_2011S@200.71:202.47 ALL AROUND US IN OUR DAILY LIVES
ErikJohansson_2011S@203.08:207.46 BUT WHEN COMBINING PHOTOGRAPHS THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER
ErikJohansson_2011S@207.63:216.6 BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT JUST LOOKS WRONG SOMEHOW SO I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE SIMPLE RULES TO FOLLOW TO ACHIEVE A REALISTIC RESULT
ErikJohansson_2011S@217.35:221.64 AS YOU CAN SEE THESE IMAGES AREN 'T REALLY SPECIAL BUT
ErikJohansson_2011S@222.02:224.43 COMBINED THEY CAN CREATE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
ErikJohansson_2011S@224.94:236.25 SO THE FIRST RULE IS THAT PHOTOS COMBINED SHOULD HAVE THE SAME PERSPECTIVE SECONDLY PHOTOS COMBINED SHOULD HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF LIGHT
ErikJohansson_2011S@237.04:242.76 AND THESE TWO IMAGES BOTH FULFILL THESE TWO REQUIREMENTS SHOT AT THE SAME HEIGHT AND IN THE SAME TYPE OF LIGHT
ErikJohansson_2011S@243.21:251.66 THE THIRD ONE IS ABOUT MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH WHERE THE DIFFERENT IMAGES BEGIN AND END BY MAKING IT SEAMLESS
ErikJohansson_2011S@252.45:256.01 MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY HOW THE IMAGE ACTUALLY WAS COMPOSED
ErikJohansson_2011S@256.08:257.85 SO
ErikJohansson_2011S@257.88:263.01 BY MATCHING COLOR CONTRAST AND BRIGHTNESS IN THE BORDERS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT IMAGES
ErikJohansson_2011S@263.02:274.6 ADDING PHOTOGRAPHIC DEFECTS LIKE DEPTH OF FIELD DESATURATED COLORS AND NOISE WE ERASE THE BORDERS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT IMAGES AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE ONE SINGLE IMAGE
ErikJohansson_2011S@274.85:279.05 DESPITE THE FACT THAT ONE IMAGE CAN CONTAIN HUNDREDS OF LAYERS BASICALLY
ErikJohansson_2011S@279.05:281.07 SO
ErikJohansson_2011S@297.04:309.86 I PERSONALLY THINK THAT IT 'S EASIER TO ACTUALLY CREATE A PLACE THAN TO FIND A PLACE BECAUSE THEN YOU DON 'T NEED TO COMPROMISE WITH THE IDEAS IN YOUR HEAD BUT IT DOES REQUIRE A LOT OF PLANNING
ErikJohansson_2011S@309.86:322.86 AND GETTING THIS IDEA DURING WINTER I KNEW THAT I HAD SEVERAL MONTHS TO PLAN IT TO FIND THE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS FOR THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE BASICALLY SO FOR EXAMPLE THE FISH WAS CAPTURED ON A FISHING TRIP
ErikJohansson_2011S@339.45:341.31 IT ALWAYS STARTS WITH A SKETCH
ErikJohansson_2011S@341.36:347.96 AN IDEA THEN IT 'S ABOUT COMBINING THE DIFFERENT PHOTOGRAPHS AND HERE
ErikJohansson_2011S@348.03:357.29 EVERY PIECE IS VERY WELL PLANNED AND IF YOU DO A GOOD JOB CAPTURING THE PHOTOS THE RESULT CAN BE QUITE BEAUTIFUL AND ALSO QUITE REALISTIC
