ErikJohansson_2011S 'M HERE TO SHARE MY PHOTOGRAPHY OR
ErikJohansson_2011S IS IT PHOTOGRAPHY BECAUSE OF COURSE
ErikJohansson_2011S THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPH THAT YOU CAN 'T TAKE WITH YOUR CAMERA
ErikJohansson_2011S YET MY INTEREST IN PHOTOGRAPHY STARTED AS I GOT MY FIRST DIGITAL CAMERA AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN IT MIXED WITH MY EARLIER PASSION FOR DRAWING BUT IT WAS A BIT DIFFERENT
ErikJohansson_2011S SO TO ME IT FELT LIKE PHOTOGRAPHY WAS MORE ABOUT BEING AT THE RIGHT PLACE AND THE RIGHT TIME I FELT LIKE ANYONE COULD DO THAT SO I WANTED TO CREATE SOMETHING DIFFERENT SOMETHING WHERE THE PROCESS STARTS WHEN YOU PRESS THE TRIGGER
ErikJohansson_2011S PHOTOS LIKE THIS
ErikJohansson_2011S BOTH DARK AND COLORFUL BUT ALL WITH A COMMON GOAL OF RETAINING THE LEVEL OF REALISM WHEN I SAY REALISM I MEAN PHOTO REALISM BECAUSE OF COURSE
ErikJohansson_2011S IT 'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN CAPTURE REALLY BUT
ErikJohansson_2011S I ALWAYS WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE IT COULD HAVE BEEN CAPTURED SOMEHOW AS A PHOTOGRAPH
ErikJohansson_2011S IS IT SOMETHING ABOUT THE LIGHT
ErikJohansson_2011S WHAT CREATES THE ILLUSION
ErikJohansson_2011S SOMETIMES
ErikJohansson_2011S WHAT WE THINK LOOKS REALISTIC REALLY SO I THINK THE BASICS ARE QUITE SIMPLE
ErikJohansson_2011S HERE WE HAVE THREE PERFECTLY IMAGINABLE PHYSICAL OBJECTS
ErikJohansson_2011S SOMETHING WE ALL CAN RELATE TO LIVING IN A THREE DIMENSIONAL WORLD BUT COMBINED IN A CERTAIN WAY
ErikJohansson_2011S THEY CAN CREATE SOMETHING THAT STILL LOOKS THREE DIMENSIONAL LIKE IT COULD EXIST
ErikJohansson_2011S BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW IT CAN 'T
ErikJohansson_2011S SO WE TRICK OUR BRAINS BECAUSE OUR BRAIN SIMPLY DOESN 'T ACCEPT THE FACT THAT IT DOESN 'T REALLY MAKE SENSE
ErikJohansson_2011S I THINK IT 'S THE THINGS THAT WE DON 'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THE THINGS
ErikJohansson_2011S ALL AROUND US IN OUR DAILY LIVES
ErikJohansson_2011S BUT WHEN COMBINING PHOTOGRAPHS THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER
ErikJohansson_2011S BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT JUST LOOKS WRONG SOMEHOW SO I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE SIMPLE RULES TO FOLLOW TO ACHIEVE A REALISTIC RESULT
ErikJohansson_2011S AS YOU CAN SEE THESE IMAGES AREN 'T REALLY SPECIAL BUT
ErikJohansson_2011S COMBINED THEY CAN CREATE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
ErikJohansson_2011S SO THE FIRST RULE IS THAT PHOTOS COMBINED SHOULD HAVE THE SAME PERSPECTIVE SECONDLY PHOTOS COMBINED SHOULD HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF LIGHT
ErikJohansson_2011S AND THESE TWO IMAGES BOTH FULFILL THESE TWO REQUIREMENTS SHOT AT THE SAME HEIGHT AND IN THE SAME TYPE OF LIGHT
ErikJohansson_2011S THE THIRD ONE IS ABOUT MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH WHERE THE DIFFERENT IMAGES BEGIN AND END BY MAKING IT SEAMLESS
ErikJohansson_2011S MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY HOW THE IMAGE ACTUALLY WAS COMPOSED
ErikJohansson_2011S SO
ErikJohansson_2011S BY MATCHING COLOR CONTRAST AND BRIGHTNESS IN THE BORDERS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT IMAGES
ErikJohansson_2011S ADDING PHOTOGRAPHIC DEFECTS LIKE DEPTH OF FIELD DESATURATED COLORS AND NOISE WE ERASE THE BORDERS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT IMAGES AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE ONE SINGLE IMAGE
ErikJohansson_2011S DESPITE THE FACT THAT ONE IMAGE CAN CONTAIN HUNDREDS OF LAYERS BASICALLY
ErikJohansson_2011S SO
ErikJohansson_2011S I PERSONALLY THINK THAT IT 'S EASIER TO ACTUALLY CREATE A PLACE THAN TO FIND A PLACE BECAUSE THEN YOU DON 'T NEED TO COMPROMISE WITH THE IDEAS IN YOUR HEAD BUT IT DOES REQUIRE A LOT OF PLANNING
ErikJohansson_2011S AND GETTING THIS IDEA DURING WINTER I KNEW THAT I HAD SEVERAL MONTHS TO PLAN IT TO FIND THE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS FOR THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE BASICALLY SO FOR EXAMPLE THE FISH WAS CAPTURED ON A FISHING TRIP
ErikJohansson_2011S IT ALWAYS STARTS WITH A SKETCH
ErikJohansson_2011S AN IDEA THEN IT 'S ABOUT COMBINING THE DIFFERENT PHOTOGRAPHS AND HERE
ErikJohansson_2011S EVERY PIECE IS VERY WELL PLANNED AND IF YOU DO A GOOD JOB CAPTURING THE PHOTOS THE RESULT CAN BE QUITE BEAUTIFUL AND ALSO QUITE REALISTIC
