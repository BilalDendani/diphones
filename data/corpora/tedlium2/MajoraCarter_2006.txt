MajoraCarter_2006 IF YOU'RE HERE TODAY AND I'M VERY HAPPY THAT YOU ARE YOU'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT HOW SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT WILL SAVE US FROM OURSELVES HOWEVER WHEN WE'RE NOT AT TED
MajoraCarter_2006 WE ARE OFTEN TOLD THAT A REAL SUSTAINABILITY POLICY AGENDA IS JUST NOT FEASIBLE ESPECIALLY IN LARGE URBAN AREAS LIKE NEW YORK CITY AND THAT'S BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE WITH DECISION MAKING POWERS IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR
MajoraCarter_2006 SHE TURNED OUT TO BE A MUCH BIGGER DOG THAN I'D ANTICIPATED WHEN SHE CAME INTO MY LIFE WE WERE FIGHTING AGAINST A HUGE WASTE FACILITY PLANNED FOR THE EAST RIVER WATERFRONT
MajoraCarter_2006 FOUR POWER PLANTS THE WORLD 'S LARGEST FOOD DISTRIBUTION CENTER AS WELL AS OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT BRING MORE THAN SIXTY THOUSAND DIESEL TRUCK TRIPS TO THE AREA EACH WEEK
MajoraCarter_2006 LIVED IN THIS AREA ALL MY LIFE AND YOU COULD NOT GET TO THE RIVER BECAUSE OF ALL THE LOVELY FACILITIES THAT I'D MENTIONED EARLIER THEN WHILE JOGGING WITH MY DOG ONE MORNING SHE PULLED ME INTO WHAT I THOUGHT WAS JUST ANOTHER
MajoraCarter_2006 AND JUST LIKE MY NEW DOG IT WAS AN IDEA THAT GOT BIGGER THAN I'D IMAGINED WE GARNERED MUCH SUPPORT ALONG THE WAY AND THE HUNTS POINT RIVERSIDE PARK BECAME THE FIRST WATERFRONT PARK THAT THE SOUTH BRONX HAD HAD IN MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS
MajoraCarter_2006 WE LEVERAGED THAT TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR SEED GRANT MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED TIMES INTO A THREE MILLION DOLLAR PARK AND IN THE FALL I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO I EXCHANGE MARRIAGE VOWS WITH
MajoraCarter_2006 MY BUTTONS BACK THERE WHICH HE DOES ALL THE TIME
MajoraCarter_2006 BUT THOSE OF US LIVING IN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES ARE THE CANARY IN THE COALMINE WE FEEL THE PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW AND HAVE FOR SOME TIME
MajoraCarter_2006 AS A BLACK PERSON IN AMERICA I AM TWICE AS LIKELY AS A WHITE PERSON TO LIVE IN AN AREA WHERE AIR POLLUTION POSES THE GREATEST RISK TO MY HEALTH I AM FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO LIVE WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF A POWER PLANT OR CHEMICAL FACILITY WHICH I DO
MajoraCarter_2006 THESE LAND USE DECISIONS CREATED THE HOSTILE CONDITIONS THAT LEAD TO PROBLEMS LIKE OBESITY DIABETES AND ASTHMA WHY WOULD SOMEONE LEAVE THEIR HOME TO GO FOR A BRISK WALK IN A TOXIC NEIGHBORHOOD
MajoraCarter_2006 OUR TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OBESITY RATE IS HIGH EVEN FOR THIS COUNTRY AND DIABETES COMES WITH IT ONE OUT OF FOUR SOUTH BRONX CHILDREN HAS ASTHMA OUR ASTHMA HOSPITALIZATION RATE IS SEVEN TIMES HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE
MajoraCarter_2006 THESE IMPACTS ARE COMING EVERYONE 'S WAY AND WE ALL PAY DEARLY FOR SOLID WASTE COSTS HEALTH PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH POLLUTION AND MORE ODIOUSLY THE COST OF IMPRISONING OUR YOUNG BLACK AND LATINO MEN
MajoraCarter_2006 WHO POSSESS UNTOLD AMOUNTS OF UNTAPPED POTENTIAL FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR RESIDENTS LIVE AT OR BELOW THE POVERTY LINE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF US ARE UNEMPLOYED LOW INCOME CITIZENS OFTEN USE EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AS PRIMARY CARE
MajoraCarter_2006 THIS COMES AT A HIGH COST TO TAXPAYERS AND PRODUCES NO PROPORTIONAL BENEFITS POOR PEOPLE ARE NOT ONLY STILL POOR THEY ARE STILL UNHEALTHY
MajoraCarter_2006 AND WON 'T DESTROY US ALL IN THE LONG TERM NONE OF US WANT THAT AND WE ALL HAVE THAT IN COMMON SO WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE IN COMMON WELL FIRST OF ALL WE'RE ALL INCREDIBLY GOOD LOOKING
MajoraCarter_2006 OK
MajoraCarter_2006 I GREW UP WITH A CRACK HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET
MajoraCarter_2006 YEAH I'M A POOR BLACK CHILD FROM THE GHETTO THESE THINGS MAKE ME DIFFERENT FROM YOU
MajoraCarter_2006 BUT THE THINGS WE HAVE IN COMMON SET ME APART FROM MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY AND I AM IN BETWEEN THESE TWO WORLDS WITH ENOUGH OF MY HEART TO FIGHT FOR JUSTICE IN THE OTHER
MajoraCarter_2006 SO HOW DID THINGS GET SO DIFFERENT FOR US IN THE LATE FORTIES MY DAD A PULLMAN PORTER SON OF A SLAVE BOUGHT A HOUSE IN THE HUNTS POINT SECTION OF THE SOUTH BRONX AND A FEW YEARS LATER HE MARRIED MY MOM
MajoraCarter_2006 AT THE TIME THE COMMUNITY WAS A MOSTLY WHITE WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD MY DAD WAS NOT ALONE AND AS OTHERS LIKE HIM PURSUED THEIR OWN VERSION OF THE AMERICAN DREAM WHITE FLIGHT BECAME COMMON IN THE SOUTH BRONX AND IN MANY CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY
MajoraCarter_2006 RED LINING WAS USED BY BANKS WHEREIN CERTAIN SECTIONS OF THE CITY INCLUDING OURS WERE DEEMED OFF LIMITS TO ANY SORT OF INVESTMENT
MajoraCarter_2006 MANY LANDLORDS BELIEVED IT WAS MORE PROFITABLE TO TORCH THEIR BUILDINGS AND COLLECT INSURANCE MONEY RATHER THAN TO SELL UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS
MajoraCarter_2006 DEAD OR INJURED FORMER TENANTS NOTWITHSTANDING HUNTS POINT WAS FORMERLY A WALK TO WORK COMMUNITY BUT NOW RESIDENTS HAD NEITHER WORK NOR HOME TO WALK TO
MajoraCarter_2006 A NATIONAL HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION BOOM WAS ADDED TO OUR PROBLEMS IN NEW YORK STATE ROBERT MOSES SPEARHEADED AN AGGRESSIVE HIGHWAY EXPANSION CAMPAIGN ONE OF ITS PRIMARY GOALS WAS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR RESIDENTS OF WEALTHY COMMUNITIES IN WESTCHESTER COUNTY TO
MajoraCarter_2006 GO TO MANHATTAN THE SOUTH BRONX WHICH LIES IN BETWEEN DID NOT STAND A CHANCE RESIDENTS WERE OFTEN GIVEN LESS THAN A MONTH 'S NOTICE BEFORE THEIR BUILDINGS WERE RAZED SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE DISPLACED
MajoraCarter_2006 THE COMMON PERCEPTION WAS THAT ONLY PIMPS AND PUSHERS AND PROSTITUTES WERE FROM THE SOUTH BRONX AND IF YOU ARE TOLD FROM YOUR EARLIEST DAYS
MajoraCarter_2006 THAT NOTHING GOOD IS GOING TO COME FROM YOUR COMMUNITY THAT IS BAD AND UGLY HOW COULD IT NOT REFLECT ON YOU SO NOW MY FAMILY 'S PROPERTY WAS WORTHLESS SAVE FOR THAT IT WAS OUR HOME AND ALL WE HAD AND LUCKILY FOR ME
MajoraCarter_2006 THAT HOME AND THE LOVE INSIDE OF IT ALONG WITH HELP FROM TEACHERS MENTORS AND FRIENDS ALONG THE WAY WAS ENOUGH NOW WHY IS THIS STORY IMPORTANT
MajoraCarter_2006 THE DISINVESTMENT THAT BEGAN IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES SET THE STAGE FOR ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICES THAT WERE TO COME ANTIQUATED ZONING AND LAND USE REGULATIONS ARE STILL USED TO THIS DAY TO CONTINUE PUTTING POLLUTING FACILITIES IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD
MajoraCarter_2006 ARE THESE FACTORS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN LAND USE POLICY IS DECIDED WHAT COSTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DECISIONS AND WHO PAYS WHO PROFITS
MajoraCarter_2006 DOES ANYTHING JUSTIFY WHAT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY GOES THROUGH THIS WAS PLANNING IN QUOTES THAT DID NOT HAVE OUR BEST INTERESTS IN MIND
MajoraCarter_2006 I WROTE A ONE AND A QUARTER MILLION FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION GRANT TO DESIGN THE PLAN FOR A WATERFRONT ESPLANADE WITH DEDICATED ON STREET BIKE PATHS
MajoraCarter_2006 THEY PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE MORE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE AS WELL AS LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THINK BIKE SHOPS JUICE STANDS WE SECURED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD FIRST PHASE PROJECTS THIS IS LAFAYETTE AVENUE
MajoraCarter_2006 AND AS REDESIGNED BY MATTHEWS NIELSEN LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS AND ONCE THIS PATH IS CONSTRUCTED IT'LL CONNECT THE SOUTH BRONX WITH MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED ACRES OF RANDALL 'S ISLAND PARK
MajoraCarter_2006 RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEPARATED BY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE FEET OF WATER BUT THIS LINK WILL CHANGE THAT AS WE NURTURE THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT ITS ABUNDANCE WILL GIVE US BACK EVEN MORE WE RUN A PROJECT CALLED THE BRONX ECOLOGICAL STEWARDSHIP TRAINING
MajoraCarter_2006 WHICH PROVIDES JOB TRAINING IN THE FIELDS OF ECOLOGICAL RESTORATIONS SO THAT FOLKS FROM OUR COMMUNITY HAVE THE SKILLS TO COMPETE FOR THESE WELL PAYING JOBS LITTLE BY LITTLE WE'RE SEEDING THE AREA WITH GREEN COLLAR JOBS THEN THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BOTH A FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL STAKE IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT
MajoraCarter_2006 EVEN DURING RUSH HOUR IT GOES VIRTUALLY UNUSED THE COMMUNITY CREATED AN ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN THAT ALLOWS FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE HIGHWAY
MajoraCarter_2006 WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY NOW TO BRING TOGETHER ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO RE ENVISION HOW THIS TWENTY EIGHT ACRES CAN BE BETTER UTILIZED FOR PARKLAND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WE ALSO BUILT THE CITY 'S NEW YORK CITY 'S FIRST GREEN AND COOL ROOF DEMONSTRATION PROJECT
MajoraCarter_2006 ON TOP OF OUR OFFICES COOL ROOFS ARE HIGHLY REFLECTIVE SURFACES THAT DON'T ABSORB SOLAR HEAT AND PASS IT ON TO THE BUILDING OR ATMOSPHERE GREEN ROOFS ARE SOIL AND LIVING PLANTS
MajoraCarter_2006 BOTH CAN BE USED INSTEAD OF PETROLEUM BASED ROOFING MATERIALS THAT ABSORB HEAT CONTRIBUTE TO URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT AND DEGRADE UNDER THE SUN WHICH WE IN TURN BREATHE
MajoraCarter_2006 SO SO COOL ANYWAY THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT IS A SPRINGBOARD FOR OUR OWN GREEN ROOF INSTALLATION BUSINESS BRINGING JOBS AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY TO THE SOUTH
MajoraCarter_2006 THAT TOO ANYWAY I KNOW CHRIS TOLD US NOT TO DO PITCHES UP HERE BUT SINCE I HAVE ALL OF YOUR ATTENTION WE NEED INVESTORS END OF PITCH IT'S BETTER TO ASK FOR FORGIVENESS THAN PERMISSION
MajoraCarter_2006 OK KATRINA
MajoraCarter_2006 PRIOR TO KATRINA THE SOUTH BRONX AND NEW ORLEANS NINTH WARD HAD A LOT IN COMMON BOTH WERE LARGELY POPULATED BY POOR PEOPLE OF COLOR
MajoraCarter_2006 BOTH HOTBEDS OF CULTURAL INNOVATION THINK HIP HOP AND JAZZ BOTH ARE WATERFRONT COMMUNITIES THAT HOST BOTH INDUSTRIES AND RESIDENTS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF ONE ANOTHER
MajoraCarter_2006 IN THE POST KATRINA ERA WE HAVE STILL MORE IN COMMON WE'RE AT BEST IGNORED AND MALIGNED AND ABUSED AT WORST BY NEGLIGENT
MajoraCarter_2006 BUT WE HAVE EMERGED WITH VALUABLE LESSONS ABOUT HOW TO DIG OURSELVES OUT WE ARE MORE THAN SIMPLY NATIONAL SYMBOLS OF URBAN BLIGHT
MajoraCarter_2006 OR PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY EMPTY CAMPAIGN PROMISES OF PRESIDENTS COME AND GONE NOW WILL WE LET THE GULF COAST LANGUISH FOR A DECADE OR TWO LIKE THE SOUTH BRONX DID OR WILL WE TAKE
MajoraCarter_2006 THIS PRESENTATION TODAY ONLY REPRESENTS SOME OF WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH LIKE A TINY LITTLE BIT YOU'VE NO CLUE BUT I'LL TELL YOU LATER IF YOU
MajoraCarter_2006 BUT I KNOW IT'S THE BOTTOM LINE OR ONE 'S PERCEPTION OF IT THAT MOTIVATES PEOPLE IN THE END I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT I LIKE TO CALL THE TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE THAT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT CAN PRODUCE
MajoraCarter_2006 HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE POSITIVE RETURNS FOR ALL CONCERNED THE DEVELOPERS GOVERNMENT AND THE COMMUNITY WHERE THESE PROJECTS GO UP AT PRESENT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING IN NEW YORK CITY
MajoraCarter_2006 AND WE ARE OPERATING WITH A COMPREHENSIVE URBAN PLANNING DEFICIT A PARADE OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES IS GOING TO PROPOSED BIG BOX AND STADIUM DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SOUTH BRONX BUT THERE IS SCANT COORDINATION BETWEEN CITY AGENCIES ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THE CUMULATIVE
MajoraCarter_2006 OF INCREASED TRAFFIC POLLUTION SOLID WASTE AND THE IMPACTS ON OPEN SPACE AND THEIR APPROACHES TO LOCAL ECONOMIC AND JOB DEVELOPMENT
MajoraCarter_2006 ARE SO LAME IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY BECAUSE ON TOP OF THAT THE WORLD 'S RICHEST SPORTS TEAM IS REPLACING THE HOUSE THAT RUTH BUILT BY DESTROYING
MajoraCarter_2006 TWO WELL LOVED COMMUNITY PARKS NOW WE'LL HAVE EVEN LESS THAN THAT STAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT EARLIER AND ALTHOUGH LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF SOUTH BRONX RESIDENTS OWN CARS THESE PROJECTS INCLUDE THOUSANDS OF NEW PARKING SPACES YET ZIP IN TERMS OF MASS
MajoraCarter_2006 I AM NOT ANTI DEVELOPMENT OURS IS A CITY NOT A WILDERNESS PRESERVE AND I'VE EMBRACED MY INNER CAPITALIST AND
MajoraCarter_2006 SO I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH DEVELOPERS MAKING MONEY THERE'S ENOUGH PRECEDENT OUT THERE TO SHOW THAT A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY FRIENDLY DEVELOPMENT
MajoraCarter_2006 CAN STILL MAKE A FORTUNE FELLOW TEDSTERS BILL MCDONOUGH AND AMORY LOVINS BOTH HEROES OF MINE BY THE WAY
MajoraCarter_2006 HAVE SHOWN THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT I DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH DEVELOPMENTS THAT HYPER EXPLOIT POLITICALLY VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES FOR PROFIT THAT IT CONTINUES IS A SHAME UPON US ALL BECAUSE WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FUTURE THAT WE CREATE
MajoraCarter_2006 BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I DO TO REMIND MYSELF OF GREATER POSSIBILITIES IS TO LEARN FROM VISIONARIES IN OTHER CITIES THIS IS MY VERSION OF GLOBALIZATION LET 'S TAKE BOGOTA
MajoraCarter_2006 LATINO SURROUNDED BY RUNAWAY GUN VIOLENCE AND DRUG TRAFFICKING A REPUTATION NOT UNLIKE THAT OF THE SOUTH BRONX
MajoraCarter_2006 HOWEVER THIS CITY WAS BLESSED IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES WITH A HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL MAYOR NAMED ENRIQUE
MajoraCarter_2006 HE LOOKED AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS FEW BOGATANOS OWN CARS YET A HUGE PORTION OF THE CITY 'S RESOURCES WAS DEDICATED TO SERVING THEM
MajoraCarter_2006 BUT AS PEOPLE BEGAN TO SEE THAT THEY WERE BEING PUT FIRST ON ISSUES REFLECTING THEIR DAY TO DAY LIVES INCREDIBLE THINGS HAPPENED PEOPLE STOPPED LITTERING CRIME RATES DROPPED BECAUSE THE STREETS WERE ALIVE WITH PEOPLE
MajoraCarter_2006 HIS ADMINISTRATION ATTACKED SEVERAL TYPICAL URBAN PROBLEMS AT ONE TIME AND ON A THIRD WORLD BUDGET AT THAT WE HAVE NO EXCUSE IN THIS COUNTRY I'M SORRY
MajoraCarter_2006 BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THEIR PEOPLE FIRST AGENDA WAS NOT MEANT TO PENALIZE THOSE WHO COULD ACTUALLY AFFORD CARS BUT RATHER TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL BOGATANOS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CITY 'S RESURGENCE
MajoraCarter_2006 THAT DEVELOPMENT SHOULD NOT COME AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION IS STILL CONSIDERED A RADICAL IDEA HERE IN THE US BUT BOGOTA 'S EXAMPLE HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE THAT
MajoraCarter_2006 YOU HOWEVER ARE BLESSED WITH THE GIFT OF INFLUENCE THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE AND WHY YOU VALUE THE INFORMATION WE EXCHANGE USE YOUR INFLUENCE IN SUPPORT OF COMPREHENSIVE SUSTAINABLE CHANGE EVERYWHERE DON'T JUST TALK ABOUT IT
MajoraCarter_2006 THIS IS A NATIONWIDE POLICY AGENDA I'M TRYING TO BUILD AND AS YOU ALL KNOW POLITICS ARE PERSONAL HELP ME MAKE GREEN THE NEW BLACK
MajoraCarter_2006 SUPPORT INVESTMENTS WITH A TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE RETURN HELP ME DEMOCRATIZE SUSTAINABILITY BY BRINGING EVERYONE TO THE TABLE AND INSISTING THAT COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING
MajoraCarter_2006 CAN BE ADDRESSED EVERYWHERE OH GOOD GLAD I HAVE A LITTLE MORE TIME LISTEN WHEN I SPOKE TO MISTER GORE THE OTHER DAY AFTER BREAKFAST I ASKED HIM HOW ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ACTIVISTS WERE GOING TO BE INCLUDED
MajoraCarter_2006 IN HIS NEW MARKETING STRATEGY HIS RESPONSE WAS A GRANT PROGRAM I DON'T THINK HE UNDERSTOOD THAT I WASN'T ASKING
MajoraCarter_2006 FOR FUNDING I WAS MAKING HIM AN OFFER
MajoraCarter_2006 WAS THAT THIS TOP DOWN APPROACH IS STILL AROUND NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG WE NEED MONEY
MajoraCarter_2006 BUT GRASSROOTS GROUPS ARE NEEDED AT THE TABLE DURING THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS
MajoraCarter_2006 OF THE NINETY PERCENT OF THE ENERGY THAT MISTER GORE REMINDED US THAT WE WASTE EVERY DAY DON'T ADD WASTING OUR ENERGY INTELLIGENCE AND HARD EARNED EXPERIENCE TO THAT
MajoraCarter_2006 COME FROM SO FAR TO MEET YOU LIKE THIS PLEASE DON'T WASTE ME
MajoraCarter_2006 BY WORKING TOGETHER WE CAN BECOME ONE OF THOSE SMALL RAPIDLY GROWING GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS
MajoraCarter_2006 WHO ACTUALLY HAVE THE AUDACITY AND COURAGE TO BELIEVE THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN CHANGE THE WORLD WE MIGHT HAVE COME TO THIS CONFERENCE FROM VERY VERY DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE
MajoraCarter_2006 BUT BELIEVE ME WE ALL SHARE ONE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL THING WE HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE AND EVERYTHING TO GAIN CIAO BELLOS
