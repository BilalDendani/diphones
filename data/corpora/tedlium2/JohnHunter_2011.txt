JohnHunter_2011@439.9:450.29 IT STARTED OUT LIKE THIS IT 'S JUST A FOUR FOOT BY FIVE FOOT PLYWOOD BOARD IN AN INNER CITY URBAN SCHOOL ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT I WAS CREATING A LESSON FOR STUDENTS

JohnHunter_2011@478.25:483.26 PLEXIGLASS STRUCTURE AND IT HAS FOUR PLEXIGLASS LAYERS
JohnHunter_2011@483.66:502.35 THERE 'S AN OUTER SPACE LAYER WITH BLACK HOLES AND SATELLITES AND RESEARCH SATELLITES AND ASTEROID MINING THERE 'S AN AIR AND SPACE LEVEL WITH CLOUDS THAT ARE BIG PUFFS OF COTTON WE PUSH AROUND AND TERRITORIAL AIR SPACES AND AIR FORCES A GROUND AND SEA LEVEL WITH THOUSANDS OF GAME PIECES ON IT EVEN AN UNDERSEA LEVEL WITH SUBMARINES AND UNDERSEA MINING
JohnHunter_2011@515.22:522.86 AND A CFO OR COMPTROLLER I CHOOSE THE PRIME MINISTER BASED ON MY RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM I OFFER THEM THE JOB THEY CAN TURN IT DOWN
JohnHunter_2011@522.86:532.26 AND THEN THEY CHOOSE THEIR OWN CABINET THERE 'S A WORLD BANK ARMS DEALERS AND A UNITED NATIONS THERE 'S ALSO A WEATHER GODDESS WHO CONTROLS A RANDOM STOCK MARKET AND RANDOM WEATHER
JohnHunter_2011@536.94:549.99 PAGE CRISIS DOCUMENT WITH FIFTY INTERLOCKING PROBLEMS SO THAT IF ONE THING CHANGES EVERYTHING ELSE CHANGES I THROW THEM INTO THIS COMPLEX MATRIX AND THEY TRUST ME BECAUSE WE HAVE A DEEP RICH RELATIONSHIP TOGETHER
JohnHunter_2011@551.41:553.39 AND SO WITH ALL THESE CRISES
JohnHunter_2011@553.65:557.05 WE HAVE LET 'S SEE ETHNIC AND MINORITY TENSIONS

JohnHunter_2011@581.96:584.51 AND THEY 'VE DONE IT SEVERAL TIMES
JohnHunter_2011@588.82:603.23 SOME CHILD IT 'S BASICALLY A TROUBLEMAKER AND I HAVE MY TROUBLEMAKER PUT TO USE BECAUSE THEY ON THE SURFACE ARE TRYING TO SAVE THE WORLD AND THEIR POSITION IN THE GAME BUT THEY 'RE ALSO TRYING TO UNDERMINE EVERYTHING
JohnHunter_2011@609.86:624.5 THE SABOTEUR IS THERE AND WE ALSO READ FROM SUN TZU 'S THE ART OF WAR FOURTH GRADERS UNDERSTAND IT NINE YEARS OLD AND THEY HANDLE THAT AND USE THAT TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO NOT FOLLOW AT FIRST THEY DO THE PATHS TO POWER AND DESTRUCTION
JohnHunter_2011@624.5:626.5 THE PATH TO WAR
JohnHunter_2011@626.5:644.77 THEY LEARN TO OVERLOOK SHORT SIGHTED REACTIONS AND IMPULSIVE THINKING TO THINK IN A LONG TERM MORE CONSEQUENTIAL WAY STEWART BRAND IS HERE AND ONE OF THE IDEAS FOR THIS GAME CAME FROM HIM WITH A COEVOLUTION QUARTERLY ARTICLE ON A PEACE FORCE AND IN THE GAME SOMETIMES STUDENTS ACTUALLY FORM A PEACE FORCE
JohnHunter_2011@644.81:654.94 I 'M JUST A CLOCK WATCHER I 'M JUST A CLARIFIER I 'M JUST A FACILITATOR THE STUDENTS RUN THE GAME I HAVE NO CHANCE TO MAKE ANY POLICY WHATSOEVER ONCE THEY START PLAYING
JohnHunter_2011@654.94:658.63 SO I 'LL JUST SHARE WITH YOU
JohnHunter_2011@677.43:696.64 CAN 'T TELL THEM ANYTHING BECAUSE I DON 'T KNOW THE ANSWER AND I ADMIT THE TRUTH TO THEM RIGHT UP FRONT I DON 'T KNOW AND BECAUSE I DON 'T KNOW THEY 'VE GOT TO DIG UP THE ANSWER AND SO I APOLOGIZE TO THEM AS WELL I SAY I 'M SO SORRY BOYS AND GIRLS BUT THE TRUTH IS WE HAVE LEFT THIS WORLD TO YOU IN SUCH A SAD AND TERRIBLE SHAPE AND WE HOPE YOU CAN
JohnHunter_2011@696.64:699.74 FIX IT FOR US AND MAYBE THIS GAME WILL HELP YOU LEARN HOW TO DO
JohnHunter_2011@724.25:732.04 IT 'S A SERIOUS QUESTION WHO IS REALLY IN CHARGE I 'VE LEARNED TO CEDE CONTROL OF THE CLASSROOM OVER TO THE STUDENTS OVER TIME
JohnHunter_2011@749.06:755.14 SO I 'LL JUST SHARE WITH YOU SOME STORIES VERY QUICKLY OF SOME MAGICAL THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED
JohnHunter_2011@755.67:769.17 IN THIS GAME WE HAD A LITTLE GIRL AND SHE WAS THE DEFENSE MINISTER OF THE POOREST NATION AND THE DEFENSE MINISTER SHE HAD THE TANK CORPS AND AIR FORCE AND SO FORTH AND SHE WAS NEXT DOOR TO A VERY WEALTHY OIL RICH NEIGHBOR
JohnHunter_2011@769.17:785.63 WITHOUT PROVOCATION SUDDENLY SHE ATTACKED AGAINST HER PRIME MINISTER 'S ORDERS THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR 'S OIL FIELDS SHE MARCHED INTO THE OIL FIELD RESERVES SURROUNDED IT WITHOUT FIRING A SHOT AND SECURED IT AND HELD IT AND THAT NEIGHBOR WAS UNABLE TO CONDUCT ANY MILITARY OPERATIONS BECAUSE THEIR FUEL SUPPLY WAS LOCKED UP
JohnHunter_2011@786.43:791.66 WE WERE ALL UPSET WITH HER WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS THIS IS THE WORLD PEACE GAME WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
JohnHunter_2011@831.21:834.61 SO A FEW GAME DAYS LATER IT CAME TO LIGHT
JohnHunter_2011@834.61:853.04 THAT WE FOUND OUT THIS MAJOR COUNTRY WAS PLANNING A MILITARY OFFENSIVE TO DOMINATE THE ENTIRE WORLD HAD THEY HAD THEIR FUEL SUPPLIES THEY WOULD HAVE DONE IT SHE WAS ABLE TO SEE THE VECTORS AND TREND LINES AND INTENTIONS LONG BEFORE ANY OF US AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND MADE A PHILOSOPHICAL DECISION
JohnHunter_2011@853.04:855.06 TO ATTACK IN A PEACE GAME
JohnHunter_2011@855.65:862.23 NOW SHE USED A SMALL WAR TO AVERT A LARGER WAR SO WE STOPPED AND HAD A VERY GOOD PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER THAT WAS RIGHT
JohnHunter_2011@862.71:872.62 CONDITIONAL GOOD OR NOT RIGHT THAT 'S THE KIND OF THINKING THAT WE PUT THEM IN THE SITUATIONS I COULD NOT HAVE DESIGNED THAT IN TEACHING IT IT CAME ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY THROUGH THEIR COLLECTIVE
JohnHunter_2011@932.24:934.8 BY THE THIRD SENTENCE SHE WAS IN TEARS
JohnHunter_2011@935.9:937.55 I WAS IN TEARS
JohnHunter_2011@939:945.72 EVERYBODY UNDERSTOOD THAT WHEN WE LOSE SOMEBODY THE WINNERS ARE NOT GLOATING WE ALL LOSE
JohnHunter_2011@946.16:952.57 AND IT WAS AN AMAZING OCCURRENCE AND AN AMAZING UNDERSTANDING I 'LL SHOW YOU WHAT MY FRIEND DAVID SAYS ABOUT THIS HE 'S BEEN IN MANY BATTLES
JohnHunter_2011@986.97:1002.89 I GET CHILLS EVERY TIME I SEE THAT THAT 'S THE KIND OF ENGAGEMENT YOU WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN AND I CAN 'T DESIGN THAT I CAN 'T PLAN THAT AND I CAN 'T EVEN TEST THAT BUT IT 'S SELF EVIDENT ASSESSMENT WE KNOW THAT 'S AN AUTHENTIC ASSESSMENT OF LEARNING
JohnHunter_2011@1016.5:1022.36 WE HAD PLAYED THE GAME ONE SESSION AFTER SCHOOL FOR MANY WEEKS ABOUT SEVEN WEEKS
JohnHunter_2011@1022.36:1032.63 AND WE HAD ESSENTIALLY SOLVED ALL FIFTY OF THE INTERLOCKING CRISES THE WAY THE GAME IS WON IS ALL FIFTY PROBLEMS HAVE TO BE SOLVED AND EVERY COUNTRY 'S ASSET VALUE HAS TO BE INCREASED ABOVE ITS STARTING POINT
JohnHunter_2011@1032.63:1045.15 SOME ARE POOR SOME ARE WEALTHY THERE ARE BILLIONS THE WORLD BANK PRESIDENT WAS A THIRD GRADER ONE TIME HE SAYS HOW MANY ZEROS IN A TRILLION I 'VE GOT TO CALCULATE THAT RIGHT AWAY BUT HE WAS SETTING FISCAL POLICY IN THAT GAME FOR HIGH SCHOOL PLAYERS WHO WERE PLAYING WITH HIM
JohnHunter_2011@1091.95:1096.45 PRINCIPAL WALKS IN I 'M OUT OF A JOB THE PARENTS WERE LOOKING
JohnHunter_2011@1121.05:1123.09 AND HE SAYS YES
JohnHunter_2011@1123.09:1128.02 AND THE GAME IS WON SPONTANEOUS COMPASSION
JohnHunter_2011@1128.02:1130.66 THAT COULD NOT BE PLANNED FOR
JohnHunter_2011@1130.66:1149.95 THAT WAS UNEXPECTED AND UNPREDICTABLE EVERY GAME WE PLAY IS DIFFERENT SOME GAMES ARE MORE ABOUT SOCIAL ISSUES SOME ARE MORE ABOUT ECONOMIC ISSUES SOME GAMES ARE MORE ABOUT WARFARE BUT I DON 'T TRY TO DENY THEM THAT REALITY OF BEING HUMAN I ALLOW THEM TO GO THERE AND THROUGH THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE LEARN IN A BLOODLESS WAY
JohnHunter_2011@1150.18:1152.2 HOW NOT TO DO
JohnHunter_2011@1152.37:1157.05 WHAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE THE WRONG THING AND THEY FIND OUT WHAT IS RIGHT THEIR OWN WAY THEIR OWN SELVES
JohnHunter_2011@1158.59:1160.31 AND SO IN THIS GAME
JohnHunter_2011@1160.56:1164.15 I 'VE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM IT BUT I WOULD SAY THAT
JohnHunter_2011@1166.18:1169.03 IF ONLY THEY COULD
JohnHunter_2011@1169.03:1176.27 PICK UP A CRITICAL THINKING TOOL OR CREATIVE THINKING TOOL FROM THIS GAME AND LEVERAGE SOMETHING GOOD FOR THE WORLD
JohnHunter_2011@1177.31:1181.94 THEY MAY SAVE US ALL IF ONLY
JohnHunter_2011@1183.27:1187.89 AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OF MY TEACHERS ON WHOSE SHOULDERS I 'M STANDING
