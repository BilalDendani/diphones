MatthieuRicard_2004@13.69:22.35 I GUESS IT IS A RESULT OF GLOBALIZATION THAT YOU CAN FIND COCA COLA TINS ON TOP OF EVEREST AND BUDDHIST MONK IN MONTEREY
MatthieuRicard_2004@25.29:28.65 AND SO I JUST CAME TWO DAYS AGO FROM THE
MatthieuRicard_2004@37.66:39.95 AND TO SHOW THE PLACE WHERE
MatthieuRicard_2004@43.31:49.31 ME WHO BEGAN WITH BEING A MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST IN PASTEUR INSTITUTE AND FOUND THEIR WAY TO THE
MatthieuRicard_2004@52.05:54.71 SO THESE ARE A FEW IMAGES I WAS LUCKY TO
MatthieuRicard_2004@55.48:56.46 TAKE AND BE THERE
MatthieuRicard_2004@59.92:62.27 IN EASTERN TIBET WONDERFUL
MatthieuRicard_2004@64.45:66.07 THIS IS FROM MARLBORO COUNTRY
MatthieuRicard_2004@76.21:82.44 THIS IS THE HOTTEST DAY OF THE YEAR SOMEWHERE IN EASTERN TIBET ON AUGUST ONE ST AND THE NIGHT BEFORE
MatthieuRicard_2004@83.56:87.63 WE CAMPED AND MY TIBETAN FRIENDS SAID WE ARE GOING TO SLEEP OUTSIDE
MatthieuRicard_2004@89.03:90.94 WHY WE HAVE ENOUGH SPACE IN THE
MatthieuRicard_2004@97.68:102.43 SO NOW WE ARE GOING TO SPEAK OF HAPPINESS AS A FRENCHMAN I MUST SAY THAT
MatthieuRicard_2004@103.19:107.69 A LOT OF FRENCH INTELLECTUALS THAT THINK HAPPINESS IS NOT AT ALL INTERESTING
MatthieuRicard_2004@110.32:117.07 ON HAPPINESS AND THERE WAS A CONTROVERSY AND SOMEONE WROTE AN ARTICLE SAYING DON'T IMPOSE ON US THE DIRTY WORK
MatthieuRicard_2004@119.43:128.57 WE DON'T CARE ABOUT BEING HAPPY WE NEED TO LIVE WITH PASSION WE LIKE THE UPS AND DOWNS OF LIFE WE LIKE OUR SUFFERING BECAUSE IT'S SO GOOD WHEN IT CEASES FOR
MatthieuRicard_2004@133.29:135.73 THIS IS WHAT I SEE FROM THE BALCONY OF MY
MatthieuRicard_2004@138.35:141.63 IT'S ABOUT TWO METERS BY THREE AND YOU ARE ALL WELCOME ANY TIME
MatthieuRicard_2004@143.95:145.10 NOW LET 'S COME TO
MatthieuRicard_2004@153.35:157.43 IT SEEMS THAT NO ONE WAKES UP IN THE MORNING THINKING MAY I
MatthieuRicard_2004@159.94:162.09 WHICH MEANS THAT SOMEHOW
MatthieuRicard_2004@164.68:168.37 DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN THE SHORT OR THE LONG TERM
MatthieuRicard_2004@173.44:177.50 SOMEHOW IS RELATED TO A DEEP PROFOUND DESIRE FOR
MatthieuRicard_2004@180.29:184.55 AS PASCAL SAID EVEN THE ONE WHO HANGS HIMSELF SOMEHOW
MatthieuRicard_2004@185.22:186.90 IS LOOKING FOR CESSATION OF
MatthieuRicard_2004@191.63:194.42 BUT THEN IF YOU LOOK IN THE LITERATURE EAST AND WEST
MatthieuRicard_2004@194.89:197.52 YOU CAN FIND INCREDIBLE DIVERSITY
MatthieuRicard_2004@201.62:206.22 ONLY BELIEVED IN REMEMBERING THE PAST IMAGINING THE FUTURE NEVER THE PRESENT
MatthieuRicard_2004@206.88:212.62 SOME PEOPLE SAY HAPPINESS IS RIGHT NOW IT'S THE QUALITY OF THE FRESHNESS OF THE PRESENT MOMENT
MatthieuRicard_2004@214.07:214.96 AND THAT LED TO
MatthieuRicard_2004@226.49:231.08 THAT WOULD BE FINE IF IT WAS JUST A SECONDARY PREOCCUPATION IN LIFE
MatthieuRicard_2004@232.21:234.23 BUT NOW IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO
MatthieuRicard_2004@238.23:239.52 WE BETTER KNOW WHAT IT IS
MatthieuRicard_2004@240.25:240.52 HAVE SOME
MatthieuRicard_2004@245.51:253.19 THAT WE DON'T KNOW THAT IS WHY SO OFTEN ALTHOUGH WE SEEK HAPPINESS IT SEEMS WE TURN OUR BACK TO IT ALTHOUGH WE WANT TO AVOID SUFFERING
MatthieuRicard_2004@260.36:261.77 ONE OF THE MOST COMMON ONES IS
MatthieuRicard_2004@262.65:267.21 HAPPINESS AND PLEASURE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE TWO
MatthieuRicard_2004@280.90:281.72 CHOCOLATE CAKE
MatthieuRicard_2004@282.36:285.88 FIRST SERVING IS DELICIOUS SECOND ONE NOT SO MUCH THEN WE
MatthieuRicard_2004@290.39:292.23 OF THINGS WE GET TIRED
MatthieuRicard_2004@293.85:296.17 I USED TO BE A FAN OF BACH I USED TO PLAY IT ON THE
MatthieuRicard_2004@297.52:301.81 I CAN HEAR IT TWO THREE FIVE TIMES IF I HAD TO HEAR IT TWENTY FOUR HOURS NON STOP
MatthieuRicard_2004@303.00:303.93 VERY TIRING
MatthieuRicard_2004@304.64:308.21 IF YOU ARE FEELING VERY COLD YOU COME NEAR A FIRE IT'S SO WONDERFUL
MatthieuRicard_2004@308.82:311.13 THEN AFTER SOME MOMENTS YOU JUST GO A LITTLE BACK AND THEN
MatthieuRicard_2004@313.68:314.45 USES ITSELF
MatthieuRicard_2004@319.52:321.97 AND ALSO AGAIN IT CAN ALSO IT'S SOMETHING THAT
MatthieuRicard_2004@323.33:325.31 IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS RADIATING OUTSIDE
MatthieuRicard_2004@325.86:330.26 LIKE YOU CAN FEEL INTENSE PLEASURE AND SOME OTHERS AROUND YOU CAN BE SUFFERING
MatthieuRicard_2004@334.15:336.43 WHAT THEN WILL BE HAPPINESS AND HAPPINESS OF COURSE IS SUCH
MatthieuRicard_2004@337.66:339.20 SO LET 'S SAY WELL BEING
MatthieuRicard_2004@341.78:343.92 AND SO I THINK THE BEST DEFINITION ACCORDING TO THE
MatthieuRicard_2004@348.35:348.69 NOT
MatthieuRicard_2004@369.53:372.08 AND ALL THE JOYS AND SORROWS THAT CAN COME ONE 'S WAY
MatthieuRicard_2004@374.15:374.95 YOU THAT MIGHT BE
MatthieuRicard_2004@379.52:380.70 IN A WAY WHY NOT
MatthieuRicard_2004@395.35:401.87 YOU HIT THE SOLID ROCK WHEN YOU ARE SURFING ON THE TOP YOU ARE ALL ELATED SO YOU GO FROM ELATION TO DEPRESSION THERE'S NO
MatthieuRicard_2004@403.99:406.36 NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE HIGH SEA
MatthieuRicard_2004@414.52:415.49 OF THE OCEAN IS
MatthieuRicard_2004@449.65:459.47 TO HAVE EVERYTHING TO BE HAPPY THAT VERY SENTENCE ALREADY REVEALS THE DOOM OF DESTRUCTION OF HAPPINESS TO HAVE EVERYTHING IF WE MISS SOMETHING IT COLLAPSES
MatthieuRicard_2004@461.20:464.33 AND ALSO WHEN THINGS GO WRONG WE TRY TO FIX THE OUTSIDE SO MUCH
MatthieuRicard_2004@474.79:476.82 LOOK AT INNER CONDITIONS
MatthieuRicard_2004@486.45:494.36 WE KNOW BY EXPERIENCE THAT WE CAN BE WHAT WE CALL IN LITTLE PARADISE AND YET BE COMPLETELY UNHAPPY WITHIN
MatthieuRicard_2004@497.10:503.88 WAS ONCE IN PORTUGAL AND THERE WAS A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION GOING ON EVERYWHERE SO ONE EVENING HE SAID LOOK YOU ARE DOING ALL THESE THINGS BUT
MatthieuRicard_2004@505.25:509.11 NICE ALSO TO BUILD SOMETHING WITHIN AND HE SAID UNLESS THAT
MatthieuRicard_2004@509.90:515.05 EVEN YOU GET HIGH TECH FLAT ON THE ONE HUNDREDTH FLOOR OF A SUPER MODERN
MatthieuRicard_2004@517.68:521.78 IF YOU ARE DEEPLY UNHAPPY WITHIN ALL YOU ARE GOING TO LOOK FOR IS A WINDOW FROM WHICH TO
MatthieuRicard_2004@524.82:525.66 SO NOW AT THE
MatthieuRicard_2004@542.73:544.62 IT'S WONDERFUL TO LIVE LONGER
MatthieuRicard_2004@545.25:550.41 TO HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION EDUCATION TO BE ABLE TO TRAVEL TO HAVE FREEDOM
MatthieuRicard_2004@564.89:570.16 SO THEN WHEN WE ASK ONESELF HOW TO NURTURE THE CONDITION FOR HAPPINESS
MatthieuRicard_2004@573.07:574.40 THOSE WHICH WILL UNDERMINE
MatthieuRicard_2004@577.23:579.98 SO THEN THIS NEEDS TO HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE
MatthieuRicard_2004@580.59:585.42 WE HAVE TO KNOW FROM OURSELF THERE ARE CERTAIN STATE OF MIND THAT ARE CONDUCIVE TO THIS FLOURISHING
MatthieuRicard_2004@586.00:587.26 THIS WELL BEING WHAT THE
MatthieuRicard_2004@591.38:592.66 THERE ARE SOME WHICH ARE ADVERSE
MatthieuRicard_2004@593.86:594.71 WELL BEING
MatthieuRicard_2004@596.05:598.03 AND SO IF WE LOOK FROM OUR OWN EXPERIENCE
MatthieuRicard_2004@599.88:601.53 ANGER HATRED
MatthieuRicard_2004@606.64:607.65 STRONG GRASPING
MatthieuRicard_2004@608.65:615.66 THEY DON'T LEAVE US IN SUCH A GOOD STATE AFTER WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IT AND ALSO THEY ARE DETRIMENTAL TO OTHERS HAPPINESS
MatthieuRicard_2004@617.35:618.69 SO WE MAY CONSIDER
MatthieuRicard_2004@619.22:621.58 THAT THE MORE THOSE ARE INVADING OUR MIND AND
MatthieuRicard_2004@627.97:630.85 AT THE OPPOSITE EVERYONE KNOWS DEEP WITHIN
MatthieuRicard_2004@631.46:637.48 THAT AN ACT OF SELFLESS GENEROSITY IF FROM THE DISTANCE WITHOUT ANYONE KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT
MatthieuRicard_2004@638.03:640.49 WE COULD SAVE A CHILD 'S LIFE
MatthieuRicard_2004@648.83:649.76 SUCH A SENSE OF
MatthieuRicard_2004@658.04:661.48 TO CHANGE OUR WAY OF BEING TO TRANSFORM ONE 'S MIND
MatthieuRicard_2004@663.49:663.77 THOSE
MatthieuRicard_2004@669.52:674.13 IS CHANGE POSSIBLE IN OUR EMOTIONS IN OUR TRAITS IN OUR MOODS
MatthieuRicard_2004@675.15:677.02 FOR THAT WE HAVE TO ASK WHAT IS NATURE
MatthieuRicard_2004@678.25:680.66 AND IF WE LOOK FROM THE EXPERIENTIAL POINT OF
MatthieuRicard_2004@682.86:687.08 THERE IS A PRIMARY QUALITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT'S JUST THE MERE FACT TO BE
MatthieuRicard_2004@690.95:694.27 IS LIKE A MIRROR THAT ALLOWS ALL IMAGES TO RISE
MatthieuRicard_2004@695.41:699.70 YOU CAN HAVE UGLY FACES BEAUTIFUL FACES IN THE MIRROR THE MIRROR ALLOWS THAT
MatthieuRicard_2004@700.19:705.18 THE MIRROR IS NOT TAINTED IS NOT MODIFIED IS NOT ALTERED BY THOSE IMAGES
MatthieuRicard_2004@711.16:713.27 THE BARE CONSCIOUSNESS PURE AWARENESS
MatthieuRicard_2004@717.29:718.32 TAINTED INTRINSICALLY
MatthieuRicard_2004@718.65:724.32 HATRED OR JEALOUSY BECAUSE THEN IF IT WAS ALWAYS THERE LIKE A DYE THAT WOULD PERMEATE THE
MatthieuRicard_2004@725.74:731.84 THEN IT WOULD BE FOUND ALL THE TIME SOMEWHERE WE KNOW WE'RE NOT ALWAYS ANGRY ALWAYS JEALOUS ALWAYS
MatthieuRicard_2004@733.35:739.51 SO BECAUSE THE BASIC FABRIC OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS THIS PURE COGNITIVE QUALITY THAT DIFFERENTIATES IT FROM A
MatthieuRicard_2004@740.68:746.54 THERE IS A POSSIBILITY FOR CHANGE BECAUSE ALL EMOTIONS ARE FLEETING THAT IS THE GROUND FOR MIND TRAINING
MatthieuRicard_2004@747.51:749.02 MIND TRAINING IS BASED ON THE
MatthieuRicard_2004@761.08:765.06 WANT TO HARM AND WANT TO DO GOOD YOU CANNOT IN THE SAME GESTURE SHAKE
MatthieuRicard_2004@767.80:769.49 SO THERE ARE NATURAL ANTIDOTES
MatthieuRicard_2004@774.79:776.29 SO THAT'S THE WAY TO PROCEED
MatthieuRicard_2004@780.76:782.62 A KIND OF SENSE OF INNER FREEDOM
MatthieuRicard_2004@783.86:786.60 OPPOSITE TO INTENSE GRASPING AND OBSESSION
MatthieuRicard_2004@790.60:792.33 KINDNESS AGAINST HATRED
MatthieuRicard_2004@793.39:797.14 BUT OF COURSE EACH EMOTION THEN WOULD NEED A PARTICULAR ANTIDOTE
MatthieuRicard_2004@798.37:801.85 ANOTHER WAY IS TO TRY TO FIND A GENERAL ANTIDOTE TO ALL EMOTIONS
MatthieuRicard_2004@803.31:805.08 AND THAT'S BY LOOKING AT THE VERY NATURE
MatthieuRicard_2004@806.54:809.46 USUALLY WHEN WE FEEL ANNOYED HATRED
MatthieuRicard_2004@810.60:813.64 WITH SOMEONE OR OBSESSED WITH SOMETHING
MatthieuRicard_2004@814.08:819.76 THE MIND GOES AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THAT OBJECT EACH TIME IT GOES TO THE OBJECT IT REINFORCES THAT OBSESSION OR THAT
MatthieuRicard_2004@826.05:829.36 SO WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK NOW IS INSTEAD OF LOOKING OUTWARD WE
MatthieuRicard_2004@831.92:837.04 ITSELF IT LOOKS VERY MENACING LIKE A BILLOWING MONSOON CLOUD
MatthieuRicard_2004@839.71:841.72 WE THINK WE COULD SIT ON THE CLOUD BUT IF YOU GO THERE
MatthieuRicard_2004@843.96:845.78 LIKEWISE IF YOU LOOK AT THE THOUGHT OF
MatthieuRicard_2004@850.84:852.07 IF YOU DO THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN
MatthieuRicard_2004@866.78:868.79 SO THIS IS THE PRINCIPAL OF MIND TRAINING
MatthieuRicard_2004@874.22:874.72 BECAUSE WE
MatthieuRicard_2004@875.90:880.07 TIME FOR ALL THOSE FAULTS IN OUR MIND THE TENDENCIES TO
MatthieuRicard_2004@881.07:883.23 SO IT WILL TAKE TIME TO UNFOLD THEM AS WELL
MatthieuRicard_2004@884.30:885.15 WAY TO GO
MatthieuRicard_2004@885.85:887.28 MIND TRANSFORMATION THAT IS THE
MatthieuRicard_2004@888.08:888.42 MEANING
MatthieuRicard_2004@890.29:902.95 IT MEANS FAMILIARIZATION WITH A NEW WAY OF BEING NEW WAY OF PERCEIVING THINGS WHICH IS MORE AN ADEQUATION WITH REALITY WITH INTERDEPENDENCE WITH THE STREAM AND CONTINUOUS TRANSFORMATION WHICH OUR BEING AND OUR CONSCIOUSNESS
MatthieuRicard_2004@920.22:921.39 THE LAST TWENTY YEARS
MatthieuRicard_2004@921.78:928.06 THOUGHT TO BE MORE OR LESS FIXED WHEN WE REACHED ADULT AGE NOW RECENTLY IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT IT CAN CHANGE A LOT
MatthieuRicard_2004@929.72:936.18 WE HEARD WHO HAS DONE TEN THOUSAND HOURS OF VIOLIN PRACTICE SOME AREA THAT CONTROLS THE MOVEMENTS OF FINGERS IN THE BRAIN
MatthieuRicard_2004@936.62:942.01 CHANGE A LOT INCREASING REINFORCEMENT OF THE SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS SO
MatthieuRicard_2004@942.40:946.03 CAN WE DO THAT WITH HUMAN QUALITIES WITH LOVING KINDNESS
MatthieuRicard_2004@946.70:948.30 WITH PATIENCE WITH OPENNESS
MatthieuRicard_2004@949.25:951.91 SO THAT'S WHAT THOSE GREAT MEDITATORS HAVE BEEN DOING
MatthieuRicard_2004@965.33:974.85 THEY DO LIKE THREE YEARS RETREAT WHERE THEY DO MEDITATE TWELVE HOURS A DAY AND THEN THE REST OF THEIR LIFE THEY WILL DO THAT THREE OR FOUR HOURS A DAY THEY ARE REAL OLYMPIC CHAMPIONS OF MIND TRAINING
MatthieuRicard_2004@978.22:979.33 THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE THE
MatthieuRicard_2004@984.03:985.54 AND FIFTY SIX ELECTRODES
MatthieuRicard_2004@991.23:992.97 SO WHAT DID THEY FIND
MatthieuRicard_2004@994.93:996.49 THE SCIENTIFIC EMBARGO
MatthieuRicard_2004@998.01:1001.03 HAS BEEN TO SUBMITTED TO NATURE HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE ACCEPTED
MatthieuRicard_2004@1002.49:1003.11 THE STATE OF
MatthieuRicard_2004@1010.78:1013.72 IN A STATE WHERE THERE'S NOTHING BUT LOVING KINDNESS
MatthieuRicard_2004@1015.00:1015.19 TO
MatthieuRicard_2004@1016.97:1022.90 THE TRAINING WE DO THAT WITH OBJECTS WE THINK OF PEOPLE SUFFERING WE THINK OF PEOPLE WE LOVE BUT AT SOME POINT IT CAN BE A STATE WHICH
MatthieuRicard_2004@1028.98:1031.54 ALREADY BEEN SHOWN THE BELL CURVE SHOWS
MatthieuRicard_2004@1032.65:1034.50 HUNDRED AND FIFTY CONTROLS
MatthieuRicard_2004@1035.48:1044.38 AND WHAT IS BEING LOOKED AT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT FRONTAL LOBE IN VERY SHORT PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORE ACTIVITY IN THE RIGHT SIDE
MatthieuRicard_2004@1045.14:1046.17 OF THE PREFRONTAL
MatthieuRicard_2004@1049.93:1051.63 THEY DON'T DESCRIBE A LOT OF POSITIVE
MatthieuRicard_2004@1054.09:1055.03 THE OPPOSITE ON
MatthieuRicard_2004@1056.47:1058.48 MORE TENDENCY TO
MatthieuRicard_2004@1059.86:1066.39 TO EXPRESS AND CURIOSITY AND SO FORTH SO THERE'S A BASIC LINE FOR PEOPLE AND ALSO IT CAN BE
MatthieuRicard_2004@1067.10:1075.84 YOU SEE A COMIC MOVIE YOU GO OFF TO THE LEFT SIDE IF YOU ARE HAPPY ABOUT SOMETHING YOU'LL GO MORE TO THE LEFT SIDE IF YOU HAVE A BOUT OF DEPRESSION YOU'LL GO TO THE RIGHT SIDE
MatthieuRicard_2004@1078.06:1081.42 THE ZERO POINT FIVE IS THE FULL STANDARD
MatthieuRicard_2004@1084.01:1087.06 WHO MEDITATED ON COMPASSION IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS TOTALLY OUT OF
MatthieuRicard_2004@1089.59:1093.72 SO I'VE NO TIME TO GO INTO ALL THE DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC RESULTS HOPEFULLY THEY
MatthieuRicard_2004@1094.01:1100.15 COME BUT THEY FOUND THAT THIS IS AFTER THREE AND A HALF HOURS IN A FMRI IT'S LIKE
MatthieuRicard_2004@1104.56:1116.05 ALSO IT HAS BEEN SHOWN IN OTHER LABS FOR INSTANCE PAUL EKMAN 'S LABS IN BERKELEY THAT SOME MEDITATORS ARE ABLE ALSO TO CONTROL THEIR EMOTIONAL RESPONSE MORE THAN IT COULD BE
MatthieuRicard_2004@1119.40:1129.68 GUY ON A CHAIR WITH ALL THIS KIND OF APPARATUS MEASURING YOUR PHYSIOLOGY AND THERE'S KIND OF A BOMB THAT GOES OFF IT'S SO INSTINCTIVE RESPONSE THAT IN TWENTY YEARS THEY NEVER SAW ANYONE WHO
MatthieuRicard_2004@1131.94:1134.38 SOME MEDITATORS WITHOUT TRYING TO STOP IT
MatthieuRicard_2004@1136.06:1140.02 OPEN THINKING THAT THAT BANG IS JUST GOING TO BE JUST A SMALL
MatthieuRicard_2004@1144.36:1145.45 SO THE WHOLE POINT OF THAT
MatthieuRicard_2004@1146.30:1147.93 NOT SORT OF TO MAKE
MatthieuRicard_2004@1150.35:1152.12 THING OF SHOWING EXCEPTIONAL
MatthieuRicard_2004@1152.79:1157.71 BEINGS WHO CAN JUMP OR WHATEVER IT'S MORE TO SAY THAT MIND TRAINING MATTERS
MatthieuRicard_2004@1158.72:1163.78 THAT THIS IS NOT JUST A LUXURY THIS IS NOT A SUPPLEMENTARY
MatthieuRicard_2004@1164.34:1165.21 VITAMIN FOR THE SOUL
MatthieuRicard_2004@1166.65:1168.07 SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO
MatthieuRicard_2004@1172.07:1175.59 WE ARE READY TO SPEND FIFTEEN YEARS ACHIEVING EDUCATION
MatthieuRicard_2004@1176.41:1185.92 WE LOVE TO DO JOGGING FITNESS WE DO ALL KINDS OF THINGS TO REMAIN BEAUTIFUL YET WE SPEND SURPRISINGLY LITTLE
MatthieuRicard_2004@1188.50:1189.74 OF WHAT MATTERS MOST
MatthieuRicard_2004@1202.54:1204.44 WE TRY TO DO IN DIFFERENT PLACES
MatthieuRicard_2004@1205.44:1212.24 JUST THIS ONE EXAMPLE IS WORTH A LOT OF WORK THIS LADY WITH BONE TB LEFT ALONE IN A TENT
MatthieuRicard_2004@1212.69:1215.27 GOING TO DIE WITH HER ONLY DAUGHTER
MatthieuRicard_2004@1215.81:1217.75 ONE YEAR LATER HOW SHE IS
MatthieuRicard_2004@1226.91:1230.29 AND JUST I LEAVE YOU WITH THE BEAUTY OF THOSE
MatthieuRicard_2004@1235.90:1237.61 AND JUMPING MONKS OF TIBET
