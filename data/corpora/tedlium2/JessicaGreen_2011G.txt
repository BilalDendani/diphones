JessicaGreen_2011G@23.53:36.83 WITH TRILLIONS OF LIFE FORMS INVISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE MICROORGANISMS BUILDINGS ARE COMPLEX ECOSYSTEMS THAT ARE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF MICROBES THAT ARE GOOD FOR US AND SOME THAT ARE BAD FOR US
JessicaGreen_2011G@36.83:41.65 WHAT DETERMINES THE TYPES AND DISTRIBUTIONS OF MICROBES INDOORS
JessicaGreen_2011G@41.65:54.3 BUILDINGS ARE COLONIZED BY AIRBORNE MICROBES THAT ENTER THROUGH WINDOWS AND THROUGH MECHANICAL VENTILATION SYSTEMS AND THEY ARE BROUGHT INSIDE BY HUMANS AND OTHER CREATURES
JessicaGreen_2011G@54.59:73.74 THE FATE OF MICROBES INDOORS DEPENDS ON COMPLEX INTERACTIONS WITH HUMANS AND WITH THE HUMAN BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND TODAY ARCHITECTS AND BIOLOGISTS ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO EXPLORE SMART BUILDING DESIGN THAT WILL CREATE HEALTHY BUILDINGS FOR US
JessicaGreen_2011G@74.33:83.61 WE SPEND AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF TIME IN BUILDINGS THAT ARE EXTREMELY CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS LIKE THIS BUILDING HERE
JessicaGreen_2011G@83.61:96.71 ENVIRONMENTS THAT HAVE MECHANICAL VENTILATION SYSTEMS THAT INCLUDE FILTERING HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE SPEND INDOORS IT 'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS AFFECTS OUR HEALTH
JessicaGreen_2011G@96.71:115.86 AT THE BIOLOGY AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT CENTER WE CARRIED OUT A STUDY IN A HOSPITAL WHERE WE SAMPLED AIR AND PULLED THE DNA OUT OF MICROBES IN THE AIR AND WE LOOKED AT THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ROOMS WE LOOKED AT ROOMS THAT WERE MECHANICALLY VENTILATED WHICH ARE THE DATA POINTS IN THE BLUE
JessicaGreen_2011G@115.86:133.51 WE LOOKED AT ROOMS THAT WERE NATURALLY VENTILATED WHERE THE HOSPITAL LET US TURN OFF THE MECHANICAL VENTILATION IN A WING OF THE BUILDING AND PRY OPEN THE WINDOWS THAT WERE NO LONGER OPERABLE BUT THEY MADE THEM OPERABLE FOR OUR STUDY AND WE ALSO SAMPLED THE OUTDOOR AIR IF YOU LOOK AT THE X AXIS OF THIS GRAPH
JessicaGreen_2011G@133.51:151.2 YOU 'LL SEE THAT WHAT WE COMMONLY WANT TO DO WHICH IS KEEPING THE OUTDOORS OUT WE ACCOMPLISHED THAT WITH MECHANICAL VENTILATION SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE GREEN DATA POINTS WHICH IS AIR THAT 'S OUTSIDE YOU 'LL SEE THAT THERE 'S A LARGE AMOUNT OF MICROBIAL DIVERSITY OR VARIETY OF MICROBIAL TYPES
JessicaGreen_2011G@151.2:157.01 BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE BLUE DATA POINTS WHICH IS MECHANICALLY VENTILATED AIR IT 'S NOT AS DIVERSE
JessicaGreen_2011G@157.01:173.58 BUT BEING LESS DIVERSE IS NOT NECESSARILY GOOD FOR OUR HEALTH IF YOU LOOK AT THE Y AXIS OF THIS GRAPH YOU 'LL SEE THAT IN THE MECHANICALLY VENTILATED AIR YOU HAVE A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF ENCOUNTERING A POTENTIAL PATHOGEN OR GERM
JessicaGreen_2011G@184.45:204.17 THAT TELLS YOU SOMETHING ABOUT HOW RELATED THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES ARE IN THE DIFFERENT SAMPLES THE DATA POINTS THAT ARE CLOSER TOGETHER HAVE MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MORE SIMILAR THAN DATA POINTS THAT ARE FAR APART AND THE FIRST THINGS THAT YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS GRAPH IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE BLUE DATA POINTS WHICH ARE THE MECHANICALLY VENTILATED AIR
JessicaGreen_2011G@204.17:217.85 THEY 'RE NOT SIMPLY A SUBSET OF THE GREEN DATA POINTS WHICH ARE THE OUTDOOR AIR WHAT WE 'VE FOUND IS THAT MECHANICALLY VENTILATED AIR LOOKS LIKE HUMANS IT HAS MICROBES ON IT THAT ARE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED
JessicaGreen_2011G@217.85:229.03 WITH OUR SKIN AND WITH OUR MOUTH OUR SPIT AND THIS IS BECAUSE WE 'RE ALL CONSTANTLY SHEDDING MICROBES SO ALL OF YOU RIGHT NOW ARE SHARING YOUR MICROBES WITH ONE ANOTHER
JessicaGreen_2011G@229.03:237 AND WHEN YOU 'RE OUTDOORS THAT TYPE OF AIR HAS MICROBES THAT ARE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH PLANT LEAVES AND WITH DIRT
JessicaGreen_2011G@237:245.35 WHY DOES THIS MATTER IT MATTERS BECAUSE THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IS THE SECOND MOST ENERGY INTENSIVE INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES
JessicaGreen_2011G@245.35:263.16 HOSPITALS USE TWO AND A HALF TIMES THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY AS OFFICE BUILDINGS AND THE MODEL THAT WE 'RE WORKING WITH IN HOSPITALS AND ALSO WITH MANY MANY DIFFERENT BUILDINGS IS TO KEEP THE OUTDOORS OUT AND THIS MODEL MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE THE BEST FOR OUR HEALTH
JessicaGreen_2011G@263.16:270.73 AND GIVEN THE EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS OR HOSPITAL ACQUIRED INFECTIONS
JessicaGreen_2011G@285.2:295.07 THINKING ABOUT BUILDINGS USING AN ECOSYSTEM FRAMEWORK WHERE WE CAN PROMOTE THE KINDS OF MICROBES THAT WE WANT TO HAVE INDOORS
JessicaGreen_2011G@295.07:305.49 I 'VE HEARD SOMEBODY SAY THAT YOU 'RE AS HEALTHY AS YOUR GUT AND FOR THIS REASON MANY PEOPLE EAT PROBIOTIC YOGURT SO THEY CAN PROMOTE A HEALTHY GUT FLORA
