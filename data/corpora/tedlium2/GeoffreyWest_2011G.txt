GeoffreyWest_2011G@32.85:41.51 CITIES ARE THE ORIGINS OF GLOBAL WARMING IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT HEALTH POLLUTION DISEASE
GeoffreyWest_2011G@41.51:44.94 FINANCE ECONOMIES
GeoffreyWest_2011G@44.94:58.04 ENERGY THEY 'RE ALL PROBLEMS THAT ARE CONFRONTED BY HAVING CITIES THAT 'S WHERE ALL THESE PROBLEMS COME FROM AND THE TSUNAMI OF PROBLEMS THAT WE FEEL WE 'RE FACING IN TERMS OF SUSTAINABILITY QUESTIONS
GeoffreyWest_2011G@66.46:72.87 TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE UNITED STATES WAS LESS THAN A FEW PERCENT URBANIZED IT 'S NOW MORE THAN EIGHTY TWO PERCENT
GeoffreyWest_2011G@73.03:91.14 THE PLANET HAS CROSSED THE HALFWAY MARK A FEW YEARS AGO CHINA 'S BUILDING THREE HUNDRED NEW CITIES IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS NOW LISTEN TO THIS EVERY WEEK FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE UNTIL TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTY EVERY WEEK MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE ARE BEING ADDED TO OUR CITIES
GeoffreyWest_2011G@91.14:100.72 THIS IS GOING TO AFFECT EVERYTHING EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM IF YOU STAY ALIVE IS GOING TO BE AFFECTED BY WHAT 'S HAPPENING IN CITIES IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY PHENOMENON
GeoffreyWest_2011G@100.72:113.82 HOWEVER CITIES DESPITE HAVING THIS NEGATIVE ASPECT TO THEM ARE ALSO THE SOLUTION BECAUSE CITIES ARE THE VACUUM CLEANERS AND THE MAGNETS THAT HAVE SUCKED UP
GeoffreyWest_2011G@113.83:125.46 CREATIVE PEOPLE CREATING IDEAS INNOVATION WEALTH AND SO ON SO WE HAVE THIS KIND OF DUAL NATURE AND SO THERE 'S AN URGENT NEED FOR
GeoffreyWest_2011G@125.46:138.15 A SCIENTIFIC THEORY OF CITIES NOW THESE ARE MY COMRADES IN ARMS THIS WORK HAS BEEN DONE WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY GROUP OF PEOPLE AND THEY 'VE DONE ALL THE WORK AND I 'M THE GREAT BULLSHITTER THAT TRIES TO BRING IT ALL TOGETHER
GeoffreyWest_2011G@147.62:159.02 HAVING THINGS LIKE THIS DOING THINGS LIKE THIS WITH ECONOMIES THAT ARE GROWING LIKE THIS NOT REALIZING THAT ENTROPY PRODUCES THINGS LIKE THIS
GeoffreyWest_2011G@159.19:160.81 THIS
GeoffreyWest_2011G@163.36:182.93 AND THIS AND THE QUESTION IS IS THAT WHAT EDINBURGH AND LONDON AND NEW YORK ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTY OR IS IT GOING TO BE THIS THAT 'S THE QUESTION I MUST SAY MANY OF THE INDICATORS LOOK LIKE THIS IS WHAT IT 'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE BUT LET 'S TALK ABOUT IT SO
GeoffreyWest_2011G@202.79:208.91 SO HERE 'S TWO QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE IN MY HEAD WHEN I THINK ABOUT THIS PROBLEM THE FIRST IS ARE CITIES
GeoffreyWest_2011G@214.77:230.36 IS MICROSOFT A GREAT BIG ANTHILL WHAT DO WE LEARN FROM THAT WE USE THEM METAPHORICALLY THE DNA OF A COMPANY THE METABOLISM OF A CITY AND SO ON IS THAT JUST BULLSHIT METAPHORICAL BULLSHIT OR IS THERE SERIOUS SUBSTANCE TO IT AND IF THAT IS THE CASE
GeoffreyWest_2011G@230.36:246.42 HOW COME THAT IT 'S VERY HARD TO KILL A CITY YOU COULD DROP AN ATOM BOMB ON A CITY AND THIRTY YEARS LATER IT 'S SURVIVING VERY FEW CITIES FAIL ALL COMPANIES DIE ALL COMPANIES AND IF YOU HAVE A SERIOUS THEORY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PREDICT WHEN GOOGLE IS GOING TO GO BUST
GeoffreyWest_2011G@252.31:271 WELL WE UNDERSTAND THIS VERY WELL THAT IS YOU ASK ANY GENERIC QUESTION ABOUT THIS HOW MANY TREES OF A GIVEN SIZE HOW MANY BRANCHES OF A GIVEN SIZE DOES A TREE HAVE HOW MANY LEAVES WHAT IS THE ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH EACH BRANCH WHAT IS THE SIZE OF THE CANOPY WHAT IS ITS GROWTH WHAT IS ITS MORTALITY WE HAVE A MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK
GeoffreyWest_2011G@271:279.07 BASED ON GENERIC UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES THAT CAN ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AND THE IDEA IS CAN WE DO THE SAME FOR THIS
GeoffreyWest_2011G@295.08:310.14 THE SAME PRINCIPLES THE SAME DYNAMICS THE SAME ORGANIZATION IS AT WORK IN ALL OF THESE INCLUDING US AND IT CAN SCALE OVER A RANGE OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN SIZE AND THAT IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS LIFE IS SO RESILIENT AND ROBUST
GeoffreyWest_2011G@339.34:357.89 AND HERE IT IS FOR THE GROWTH OF A RAT AND THOSE POINTS ON THERE ARE DATA POINTS THIS IS JUST THE WEIGHT VERSUS THE AGE AND YOU SEE IT STOPS GROWING VERY VERY GOOD FOR BIOLOGY ALSO ONE OF THE REASONS FOR ITS GREAT RESILIENCE VERY VERY BAD FOR ECONOMIES AND COMPANIES AND CITIES IN OUR PRESENT PARADIGM
GeoffreyWest_2011G@357.89:362.23 THIS IS WHAT WE BELIEVE THIS IS WHAT OUR WHOLE ECONOMY IS
GeoffreyWest_2011G@362.23:364.04 THRUSTING UPON US
GeoffreyWest_2011G@364.04:383.22 PARTICULARLY ILLUSTRATED IN THAT LEFT HAND CORNER HOCKEY STICKS THIS IS A BUNCH OF SOFTWARE COMPANIES AND WHAT IT IS IS THEIR REVENUE VERSUS THEIR AGE ALL ZOOMING AWAY AND EVERYBODY MAKING MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OKAY SO HOW DO WE UNDERSTAND THIS SO LET 'S FIRST TALK ABOUT BIOLOGY THIS IS
GeoffreyWest_2011G@383.22:391.11 EXPLICITLY SHOWING YOU HOW THINGS SCALE AND THIS IS A TRULY REMARKABLE GRAPH WHAT IS PLOTTED HERE IS METABOLIC RATE
GeoffreyWest_2011G@391.11:397.44 HOW MUCH ENERGY YOU NEED PER DAY TO STAY ALIVE VERSUS YOUR WEIGHT YOUR MASS
GeoffreyWest_2011G@397.44:416.95 FOR ALL OF US BUNCH OF ORGANISMS AND IT 'S PLOTTED IN THIS FUNNY WAY BY GOING UP BY FACTORS OF TEN OTHERWISE YOU COULDN 'T GET EVERYTHING ON THE GRAPH AND WHAT YOU SEE IF YOU PLOT IT IN THIS SLIGHTLY CURIOUS WAY IS THAT EVERYBODY LIES ON THE SAME LINE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE MOST COMPLEX AND DIVERSE SYSTEM IN THE UNIVERSE
GeoffreyWest_2011G@416.95:421.33 THERE 'S AN EXTRAORDINARY SIMPLICITY BEING EXPRESSED BY THIS
GeoffreyWest_2011G@421.33:435.54 IT 'S PARTICULARLY ASTONISHING BECAUSE EACH ONE OF THESE ORGANISMS EACH SUBSYSTEM EACH CELL TYPE EACH GENE HAS EVOLVED IN ITS OWN UNIQUE ENVIRONMENTAL NICHE WITH ITS OWN UNIQUE HISTORY
GeoffreyWest_2011G@444.63:458.54 BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THAT I 'VE WRITTEN DOWN AT THE BOTTOM THERE THE SLOPE OF THIS CURVE THIS STRAIGHT LINE IT 'S THREE QUARTERS ROUGHLY WHICH IS LESS THAN ONE AND WE CALL THAT SUBLINEAR AND HERE 'S THE POINT OF THAT IT SAYS THAT
GeoffreyWest_2011G@458.66:466.32 IF IT WERE LINEAR THE STEEPEST SLOPE THEN DOUBLING THE SIZE YOU WOULD REQUIRE DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY
GeoffreyWest_2011G@466.32:483.85 BUT IT 'S SUBLINEAR AND WHAT THAT TRANSLATES INTO IS THAT IF YOU DOUBLE THE SIZE OF THE ORGANISM YOU ACTUALLY ONLY NEED SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT MORE ENERGY SO A WONDERFUL THING ABOUT ALL OF BIOLOGY IS THAT IT EXPRESSES AN EXTRAORDINARY ECONOMY OF SCALE THE BIGGER YOU ARE SYSTEMATICALLY ACCORDING TO VERY WELL DEFINED RULES
GeoffreyWest_2011G@483.85:486.53 LESS ENERGY PER CAPITA NOW
GeoffreyWest_2011G@486.67:504.28 ANY PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLE YOU CAN THINK OF ANY LIFE HISTORY EVENT YOU CAN THINK OF IF YOU PLOT IT THIS WAY LOOKS LIKE THIS THERE IS AN EXTRAORDINARY REGULARITY SO YOU TELL ME THE SIZE OF A MAMMAL I CAN TELL YOU AT THE NINETY PERCENT LEVEL EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF ITS PHYSIOLOGY LIFE HISTORY
GeoffreyWest_2011G@519.33:537.31 THAT 'S A LITTLE THING THAT LIVES INSIDE AN ELEPHANT AND HERE 'S THE SUMMARY OF WHAT I 'M SAYING IF YOU TAKE THOSE NETWORKS THIS IDEA OF NETWORKS AND YOU APPLY UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES MATHEMATIZABLE UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES ALL OF THESE SCALINGS AND ALL OF THESE CONSTRAINTS
GeoffreyWest_2011G@537.31:552.92 FOLLOW INCLUDING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE FOREST THE DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CIRCULATORY SYSTEM THE DESCRIPTION WITHIN CELLS ONE OF THE THINGS I DID NOT STRESS IN THAT INTRODUCTION WAS THAT SYSTEMATICALLY THE PACE OF LIFE DECREASES AS YOU GET BIGGER
GeoffreyWest_2011G@552.92:564.01 HEART RATES ARE SLOWER YOU LIVE LONGER DIFFUSION OF OXYGEN AND RESOURCES ACROSS MEMBRANES IS SLOWER ETC THE QUESTION IS IS ANY OF THIS TRUE FOR CITIES AND COMPANIES
GeoffreyWest_2011G@564.32:582.78 SO IS LONDON A SCALED UP BIRMINGHAM WHICH IS A SCALED UP BRIGHTON ETC ETC IS NEW YORK A SCALED UP SAN FRANCISCO WHICH IS A SCALED UP SANTA FE DON 'T KNOW WE WILL DISCUSS THAT BUT THEY ARE NETWORKS AND THE MOST IMPORTANT NETWORK OF CITIES IS YOU
GeoffreyWest_2011G@582.97:596.75 CITIES ARE JUST A PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION OF YOUR INTERACTIONS OUR INTERACTIONS AND THE CLUSTERING AND GROUPING OF INDIVIDUALS HERE 'S JUST A SYMBOLIC PICTURE OF THAT AND HERE 'S SCALING OF CITIES
GeoffreyWest_2011G@596.75:611.83 THIS SHOWS THAT IN THIS VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE WHICH HAPPENS TO BE A MUNDANE EXAMPLE OF NUMBER OF PETROL STATIONS AS A FUNCTION OF SIZE PLOTTED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE BIOLOGY YOU SEE EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF THING THERE IS A SCALING
GeoffreyWest_2011G@629.15:631.81 IT SCALES IN THE SAME WAY EVERYWHERE
GeoffreyWest_2011G@631.82:636.22 THIS IS JUST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES BUT YOU DO IT IN JAPAN OR CHINA OR COLOMBIA
GeoffreyWest_2011G@636.35:640.02 ALWAYS THE SAME WITH THE SAME KIND OF
GeoffreyWest_2011G@640.16:649.92 ECONOMY OF SCALE TO THE SAME DEGREE AND ANY INFRASTRUCTURE YOU LOOK AT WHETHER IT 'S THE LENGTH OF ROADS LENGTH OF ELECTRICAL LINES ANYTHING YOU LOOK AT
GeoffreyWest_2011G@649.94:660.76 HAS THE SAME ECONOMY OF SCALE SCALING IN THE SAME WAY IT 'S AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM THAT HAS EVOLVED DESPITE ALL THE PLANNING AND SO ON BUT EVEN MORE SURPRISING
GeoffreyWest_2011G@660.76:679.71 IS IF YOU LOOK AT SOCIO ECONOMIC QUANTITIES QUANTITIES THAT HAVE NO ANALOG IN BIOLOGY THAT HAVE EVOLVED WHEN WE STARTED FORMING COMMUNITIES EIGHT TO TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO THE TOP ONE IS WAGES AS A FUNCTION OF SIZE PLOTTED IN THE SAME WAY AND THE BOTTOM ONE IS YOU LOT SUPER CREATIVES PLOTTED IN THE SAME WAY
GeoffreyWest_2011G@679.72:683.08 AND WHAT YOU SEE IS A SCALING PHENOMENON
GeoffreyWest_2011G@683.1:693 BUT MOST IMPORTANT IN THIS THE EXPONENT THE ANALOG TO THAT THREE QUARTERS FOR THE METABOLIC RATE IS BIGGER THAN ONE IT 'S ABOUT ONE POINT ONE FIVE TO ONE POINT TWO
GeoffreyWest_2011G@693:709.49 HERE IT IS WHICH SAYS THAT THE BIGGER YOU ARE THE MORE YOU HAVE PER CAPITA UNLIKE BIOLOGY HIGHER WAGES MORE SUPER CREATIVE PEOPLE PER CAPITA AS YOU GET BIGGER MORE PATENTS PER CAPITA MORE CRIME PER CAPITA AND WE 'VE LOOKED AT EVERYTHING MORE AIDS CASES
GeoffreyWest_2011G@709.49:713.99 FLU ETC AND HERE THEY 'RE ALL PLOTTED TOGETHER
GeoffreyWest_2011G@714.02:733.1 JUST TO SHOW YOU WHAT WE PLOTTED HERE IS INCOME GDP GDP OF THE CITY CRIME AND PATENTS ALL ON ONE GRAPH AND YOU CAN SEE THEY ALL FOLLOW THE SAME LINE AND HERE 'S THE STATEMENT IF YOU DOUBLE THE SIZE OF A CITY FROM ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FROM A MILLION TO TWO MILLION TEN TO TWENTY MILLION IT DOESN 'T MATTER
GeoffreyWest_2011G@750.05:751.59 THE INFRASTRUCTURE
GeoffreyWest_2011G@766.94:780.32 WHAT IS THE REASON FOR THIS WELL I DON 'T HAVE TIME TO TELL YOU ABOUT ALL THE MATHEMATICS BUT UNDERLYING THIS IS THE SOCIAL NETWORKS BECAUSE THIS IS A UNIVERSAL PHENOMENON THIS FIFTEEN PERCENT RULE
GeoffreyWest_2011G@780.32:787.43 IS TRUE NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE ON THE PLANET JAPAN CHILE PORTUGAL
GeoffreyWest_2011G@787.65:803.99 SCOTLAND DOESN 'T MATTER ALWAYS ALL THE DATA SHOWS IT 'S THE SAME DESPITE THE FACT THAT THESE CITIES HAVE EVOLVED INDEPENDENTLY SOMETHING UNIVERSAL IS GOING ON THE UNIVERSALITY TO REPEAT IS US THAT WE ARE THE CITY AND IT IS OUR INTERACTIONS
GeoffreyWest_2011G@815.73:824.18 YOU HAD THE SLOWING OF THE PACE OF LIFE AS YOU GET BIGGER IF IT 'S SOCIAL NETWORKS WITH SUPER LINEAR SCALING MORE PER CAPITA
GeoffreyWest_2011G@824.18:837.18 THEN THE THEORY SAYS THAT YOU INCREASE THE PACE OF LIFE THE BIGGER YOU ARE LIFE GETS FASTER ON THE LEFT IS THE HEART RATE SHOWING BIOLOGY ON THE RIGHT IS THE SPEED OF WALKING IN A BUNCH OF EUROPEAN CITIES SHOWING THAT INCREASE
GeoffreyWest_2011G@840.95:852.18 THIS IS WHAT WE HAD IN BIOLOGY JUST TO REPEAT ECONOMIES OF SCALE GAVE RISE TO THIS SIGMOIDAL BEHAVIOR YOU GROW FAST AND THEN STOP
GeoffreyWest_2011G@852.64:871.38 PART OF OUR RESILIENCE THAT WOULD BE BAD FOR ECONOMIES AND CITIES AND INDEED ONE OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT THE THEORY IS THAT IF YOU HAVE SUPER LINEAR SCALING FROM WEALTH CREATION AND INNOVATION THEN INDEED YOU GET FROM THE SAME THEORY A BEAUTIFUL RISING EXPONENTIAL CURVE LOVELY AND IN FACT IF YOU
GeoffreyWest_2011G@877.87:879.82 AND THE CATCH IS THAT
GeoffreyWest_2011G@879.82:882.64 THIS SYSTEM IS DESTINED TO COLLAPSE
GeoffreyWest_2011G@882.64:895.59 AND IT 'S DESTINED TO COLLAPSE FOR MANY REASONS KIND OF MALTHUSIAN REASONS THAT YOU RUN OUT OF RESOURCES AND HOW DO YOU AVOID THAT WELL WE 'VE DONE IT BEFORE WHAT WE DO IS AS WE GROW AND WE APPROACH THE COLLAPSE
GeoffreyWest_2011G@896.03:910.17 A MAJOR INNOVATION TAKES PLACE AND WE START OVER AGAIN AND WE START OVER AGAIN AS WE APPROACH THE NEXT ONE AND SO ON SO THERE 'S THIS CONTINUOUS CYCLE OF INNOVATION THAT IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN GROWTH AND AVOID COLLAPSE
GeoffreyWest_2011G@910.23:924.72 THE CATCH HOWEVER TO THIS IS THAT YOU HAVE TO INNOVATE FASTER AND FASTER AND FASTER SO THE IMAGE IS THAT WE 'RE NOT ONLY ON A TREADMILL THAT 'S GOING FASTER BUT WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE TREADMILL
GeoffreyWest_2011G@924.72:933.87 FASTER AND FASTER WE HAVE TO ACCELERATE ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS AND THE QUESTION IS CAN WE AS SOCIO ECONOMIC BEINGS AVOID A HEART ATTACK
GeoffreyWest_2011G@933.87:939.15 SO LASTLY I 'M GOING TO FINISH UP IN THIS LAST MINUTE OR TWO ASKING ABOUT COMPANIES
GeoffreyWest_2011G@957.7:966.98 THEY SCALE BEAUTIFULLY AND WE 'VE LOOKED AT TWENTY THREE THOUSAND COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES MAY I SAY AND I 'M ONLY SHOWING YOU A LITTLE BIT OF THIS
GeoffreyWest_2011G@966.98:980.14 WHAT IS ASTONISHING ABOUT COMPANIES IS THAT THEY SCALE SUBLINEARLY LIKE BIOLOGY INDICATING THAT THEY 'RE DOMINATED NOT BY SUPER LINEAR INNOVATION
GeoffreyWest_2011G@980.14:997.05 AND IDEAS THEY BECOME DOMINATED BY ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN THAT INTERPRETATION BY BUREAUCRACY AND ADMINISTRATION AND THEY DO IT BEAUTIFULLY MAY I SAY SO IF YOU TELL ME THE SIZE OF SOME COMPANY SOME SMALL COMPANY I COULD HAVE PREDICTED THE SIZE OF WALMART
GeoffreyWest_2011G@997.06:1002.72 IF IT HAS THIS SUBLINEAR SCALING THE THEORY SAYS WE SHOULD HAVE
