DavidBismark_2010G@17.48:29.37 FEW THINGS THAT BRING US HUMANS TOGETHER IN THE WAY THAT AN ELECTION DOES WE STAND IN ELECTIONS WE VOTE IN ELECTIONS WE OBSERVE ELECTIONS OUR DEMOCRACIES RELY ON ELECTIONS
DavidBismark_2010G@29.69:39.06 WE ALL UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE ELECTIONS AND WE ALL LEAVE THE HOUSE ON THE SAME DAY TO GO AND VOTE WE CHERISH THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE OUR SAY
DavidBismark_2010G@40.29:42.84 TO HELP DECIDE THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY
DavidBismark_2010G@44.64:49.12 THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEA IS THAT POLITICIANS ARE GIVEN MANDATE TO SPEAK FOR US
DavidBismark_2010G@49.47:52.31 TO MAKE DECISIONS ON OUR BEHALF THAT AFFECT US ALL
DavidBismark_2010G@53.57:63.69 WITHOUT THAT MANDATE THEY WOULD BE CORRUPT WELL UNFORTUNATELY POWER CORRUPTS AND SO PEOPLE WILL DO LOTS OF THINGS TO GET POWER AND TO STAY IN POWER
DavidBismark_2010G@68.68:77.78 YOU SEE EVEN IF THE IDEA OF THE ELECTION IS PERFECT RUNNING A COUNTRYWIDE ELECTION IS A BIG PROJECT AND BIG PROJECTS ARE MESSY
DavidBismark_2010G@78.86:82.51 WHENEVER THERE IS AN ELECTION IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING ALWAYS GOES WRONG
DavidBismark_2010G@83.21:84.59 SOMEONE TRIES TO CHEAT
DavidBismark_2010G@85.04:87.49 OR SOMETHING GOES ACCIDENTALLY AWRY
DavidBismark_2010G@88.16:92.61 A BALLOT BOX GOES MISSING HERE CHADS ARE LEFT HANGING OVER HERE
DavidBismark_2010G@94.09:106.15 TO MAKE SURE AS FEW THINGS AS POSSIBLE GO WRONG WE HAVE ALL THESE PROCEDURES AROUND THE ELECTION SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU COME TO THE POLLING STATION AND A POLL STATION WORKER ASKS FOR YOUR ID
DavidBismark_2010G@110.46:120.20 VOTING BOOTH TO FILL OUT YOUR VOTE WHEN YOU COME BACK OUT YOU GET TO DROP YOUR VOTE INTO THE BALLOT BOX WHERE IT MIXES WITH ALL THE OTHER VOTES SO THAT NO ONE KNOWS HOW YOU VOTED
DavidBismark_2010G@121.61:134.85 WHAT I WANT US TO THINK ABOUT FOR A MOMENT IS WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT AFTER YOU DROP YOUR VOTE INTO THE BALLOT BOX AND MOST PEOPLE WOULD GO HOME AND FEEL SURE THAT THEIR VOTE HAS BEEN COUNTED BECAUSE THEY TRUST THAT THE ELECTION SYSTEM WORKS
DavidBismark_2010G@135.59:142.13 THEY TRUST THAT ELECTION WORKERS AND ELECTION OBSERVERS DO THEIR JOBS AND DO THEIR JOBS CORRECTLY
DavidBismark_2010G@143.00:150.47 THE BALLOT BOXES GO TO COUNTING PLACES THEY'RE UNSEALED AND THE VOTES ARE POURED OUT AND LABORIOUSLY COUNTED
DavidBismark_2010G@162.52:164.48 WE HAVE TO TRUST A LOT OF PEOPLE
DavidBismark_2010G@165.58:168.06 WE HAVE TO TRUST A LOT OF PROCEDURES
DavidBismark_2010G@169.52:172.77 AND SOMETIMES WE EVEN HAVE TO TRUST COMPUTERS
DavidBismark_2010G@174.68:180.96 SO IMAGINE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF VOTERS CASTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF VOTES ALL TO BE COUNTED CORRECTLY
DavidBismark_2010G@181.59:184.28 AND ALL THE THINGS THAT CAN POSSIBLY GO WRONG
DavidBismark_2010G@186.10:188.23 CAUSING ALL THESE BAD HEADLINES
DavidBismark_2010G@189.71:194.57 AND YOU CANNOT HELP BUT FEEL EXHAUSTED AT THE IDEA OF TRYING TO MAKE
DavidBismark_2010G@198.41:206.04 WELL IN THE FACE OF ALL THESE BAD HEADLINES RESEARCHERS HAVE TAKEN A STEP BACK AND THOUGHT ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO ELECTIONS DIFFERENTLY
DavidBismark_2010G@207.68:210.20 THEY'VE ZOOMED OUT AND LOOKED AT THE BIG PICTURE
DavidBismark_2010G@211.02:214.74 AND THE BIG PICTURE IS THIS ELECTIONS SHOULD BE
DavidBismark_2010G@217.80:222.05 SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHECK THAT THEIR VOTES ARE COUNTED CORRECTLY
DavidBismark_2010G@222.74:226.83 WITHOUT BREAKING ELECTION SECRECY WHICH IS SO VERY IMPORTANT
DavidBismark_2010G@228.04:235.82 AND THAT'S THE TOUGH PART HOW DO WE MAKE AN ELECTION SYSTEM COMPLETELY VERIFIABLE WHILE KEEPING THE VOTES ABSOLUTELY SECRET
DavidBismark_2010G@236.71:238.35 WELL THE WAY WE'VE COME UP WITH
DavidBismark_2010G@239.37:243.94 USES COMPUTERS BUT DOESN'T DEPEND ON THEM AND THE SECRET IS THE BALLOT FORM
DavidBismark_2010G@244.40:253.32 AND IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT THESE BALLOT FORMS YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE CANDIDATE LIST IS IN A DIFFERENT ORDER ON EACH ONE AND THAT MEANS IF YOU MARK YOUR CHOICES ON ONE OF THEM
DavidBismark_2010G@253.70:260.15 AND THEN REMOVE THE CANDIDATE LIST I WON 'T BE ABLE TO TELL FROM THE BIT REMAINING WHAT YOUR VOTE IS FOR
DavidBismark_2010G@261.15:263.05 AND ON EACH BALLOT FORM THERE IS THIS
DavidBismark_2010G@272.59:281.89 BUT WHAT'S NOT COMPLICATED IS VOTING WITH ONE OF THESE FORMS SO WE CAN LET COMPUTERS DO ALL THE COMPLICATED CRYPTOGRAPHY FOR US AND THEN WE'LL USE THE PAPER
DavidBismark_2010G@285.77:288.82 SO THIS IS HOW YOU VOTE YOU GET ONE OF THESE BALLOT FORMS
DavidBismark_2010G@289.36:293.96 AT RANDOM AND THEN YOU GO INTO THE VOTING BOOTH AND YOU MARK YOUR CHOICES
DavidBismark_2010G@294.53:296.36 AND YOU TEAR ALONG A PERFORATION
DavidBismark_2010G@300.02:311.43 AND YOU SHRED THE CANDIDATE LIST AND THE BIT THAT REMAINS THE ONE WITH YOUR MARKS THIS IS YOUR ENCRYPTED VOTE SO YOU LET A POLL STATION WORKER SCAN YOUR ENCRYPTED VOTE
DavidBismark_2010G@319.24:323.67 AND DISPLAYED ON A WEBSITE FOR ANYONE TO SEE INCLUDING YOU SO
DavidBismark_2010G@324.38:338.17 YOU TAKE THIS ENCRYPTED VOTE HOME AS YOUR RECEIPT AND AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE ELECTION YOU CAN CHECK THAT YOUR VOTE WAS COUNTED BY COMPARING YOUR RECEIPT TO THE VOTE ON THE WEBSITE
DavidBismark_2010G@349.85:353.40 IF THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO FIND OUT HOW YOU VOTED THEY WON 'T BE ABLE TO
DavidBismark_2010G@355.27:363.64 NO HACKER CAN BREAK IN AND FIND OUT HOW YOU VOTED NO HACKER CAN BREAK IN AND CHANGE YOUR VOTE BECAUSE THEN IT WON 'T MATCH YOUR RECEIPT
DavidBismark_2010G@367.23:369.77 BECAUSE THEN YOU WON 'T FIND YOURS WHEN YOU LOOK FOR
DavidBismark_2010G@372.10:374.27 BUT THE ELECTION MAGIC DOESN'T STOP THERE
DavidBismark_2010G@374.81:386.72 INSTEAD WE WANT TO MAKE THE WHOLE PROCESS SO TRANSPARENT THAT NEWS MEDIA AND INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS AND ANYONE WHO WANTS TO CAN DOWNLOAD ALL THE ELECTION DATA AND DO THE COUNT THEMSELVES
DavidBismark_2010G@387.33:390.17 THEY CAN CHECK THAT ALL THE VOTES WERE COUNTED CORRECTLY
DavidBismark_2010G@390.62:395.69 THEY CAN CHECK THAT THE ANNOUNCED RESULT OF THE ELECTION IS THE CORRECT ONE
