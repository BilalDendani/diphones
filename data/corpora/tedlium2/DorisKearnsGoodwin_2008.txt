DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@16.39:26.24 I HAVE SPENT MY LIFE LOOKING INTO THE LIVES OF PRESIDENTS WHO ARE NO LONGER ALIVE WAKING UP WITH ABRAHAM LINCOLN IN THE MORNING THINKING OF FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT WHEN I WENT TO BED AT NIGHT
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@26.78:37.69 BUT WHEN I TRY AND THINK ABOUT WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT THE MEANING IN LIFE MY MIND KEEPS WANDERING BACK TO A SEMINAR THAT I TOOK WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT AT HARVARD WITH THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGIST ERIK ERIKSON
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@38.01:46.81 HE TAUGHT US THAT THE RICHEST AND FULLEST LIVES ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE AN INNER BALANCE BETWEEN THREE REALMS WORK LOVE AND PLAY
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@47.28:60.55 AND THAT TO PURSUE ONE REALM TO THE DISREGARD OF THE OTHER IS TO OPEN ONESELF TO ULTIMATE SADNESS IN OLDER AGE WHEREAS TO PURSUE ALL THREE WITH EQUAL DEDICATION IS TO MAKE POSSIBLE A LIFE FILLED NOT ONLY WITH ACHIEVEMENT BUT WITH SERENITY
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@60.90:69.06 SO SINCE I TELL STORIES LET ME LOOK BACK ON THE LIVES OF TWO OF THE PRESIDENTS I'VE STUDIED TO ILLUSTRATE THIS POINT ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND LYNDON JOHNSON
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@69.69:77.69 AS FOR THAT FIRST SPHERE OF WORK I THINK WHAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN 'S LIFE SUGGESTS IS THAT FIERCE AMBITION IS A GOOD THING
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@78.06:87.92 HE HAD A HUGE AMBITION BUT IT WASN'T SIMPLY FOR OFFICE OR POWER OR CELEBRITY OR FAME WHAT IT WAS FOR WAS TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING WORTHY ENOUGH IN LIFE
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@88.41:92.71 SO THAT HE COULD MAKE THE WORLD A LITTLE BETTER PLACE FOR HIS HAVING LIVED IN IT
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@101.11:113.55 NO SCHOOLING WAS POSSIBLE FOR HIM EXCEPT A FEW WEEKS HERE A FEW WEEKS THERE BUT HE READ BOOKS IN EVERY SPARE MOMENT HE COULD FIND IT WAS SAID WHEN HE GOT A COPY OF THE KING JAMES BIBLE OR AESOP 'S FABLES HE WAS SO EXCITED HE COULDN'T SLEEP HE COULDN'T EAT
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@113.94:120.88 THE GREAT POET EMILY DICKINSON ONCE SAID THERE IS NO FRIGATE LIKE A BOOK TO TAKE US LANDS AWAY HOW TRUE FOR LINCOLN
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@121.46:130.97 NEVER WOULD TRAVEL TO EUROPE HE WENT WITH SHAKESPEARE 'S KINGS TO MERRY ENGLAND HE WENT WITH LORD BYRON 'S POETRY TO SPAIN AND PORTUGAL LITERATURE ALLOWED HIM TO TRANSCEND HIS SURROUNDINGS
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@144.69:149.01 MOREOVER WHEN HIS MOTHER LAY DYING SHE DID NOT HOLD OUT FOR HIM THE HOPE THAT THEY WOULD MEET
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@150.52:160.87 SHE SIMPLY SAID TO HIM ABRAHAM I'M GOING AWAY FROM YOU NOW AND I SHALL NEVER RETURN AS A RESULT HE BECAME OBSESSED WITH THE THOUGHT THAT WHEN WE DIE OUR LIFE IS SWEPT AWAY DUST TO DUST
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@168.66:177.81 IF YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING WORTHY IN YOUR LIFE YOU COULD LIVE ON IN THE MEMORY OF OTHERS YOUR HONOR AND YOUR REPUTATION WOULD OUTLIVE YOUR EARTHLY EXISTENCE
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@178.45:188.08 AND THAT WORTHY AMBITION BECAME HIS LODESTAR IT CARRIED HIM THROUGH THE ONE SIGNIFICANT DEPRESSION THAT HE SUFFERED WHEN HE WAS IN HIS EARLY THIRTIES THREE THINGS HAD COMBINED TO LAY HIM LOW
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@201.60:211.66 AND HIS POLITICAL CAREER IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE WAS ON A DOWNWARD SLIDE HE WAS SO DEPRESSED THAT FRIENDS WORRIED HE WAS SUICIDAL THEY TOOK ALL KNIVES AND RAZORS AND SCISSORS FROM HIS ROOM
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@211.99:224.52 AND HIS GREAT FRIEND SPEED WENT TO HIS SIDE AND SAID LINCOLN YOU MUST RALLY OR YOU WILL DIE HE SAID THAT I WOULD JUST AS SOON DIE RIGHT NOW BUT I'VE NOT YET DONE ANYTHING TO MAKE ANY HUMAN BEING REMEMBER THAT I HAVE LIVED
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@225.13:239.76 SO FUELLED BY THAT AMBITION HE RETURNED TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE HE EVENTUALLY WON A SEAT IN CONGRESS HE THEN RAN TWICE FOR THE SENATE LOST TWICE EVERYONE IS BROKEN BY LIFE ERNEST HEMINGWAY ONCE SAID BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE STRONGER IN THE BROKEN PLACES
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@240.14:249.35 SO THEN HE SURPRISED THE NATION WITH AN UPSET VICTORY FOR THE PRESIDENCY OVER THREE FAR MORE EXPERIENCED FAR MORE EDUCATED FAR MORE CELEBRATED RIVALS
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@249.90:258.88 AND THEN WHEN HE WON THE GENERAL ELECTION HE STUNNED THE NATION EVEN MORE BY APPOINTING EACH OF THESE THREE RIVALS INTO HIS CABINET IT WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED ACT AT THE TIME
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@271.85:280.10 BUT PERHAPS MY OLD FRIEND LYNDON JOHNSON MIGHT HAVE PUT IT IN LESS NOBLE FASHION BETTER TO HAVE YOUR ENEMIES INSIDE THE TENT PISSING OUT THAN OUTSIDE THE TENT PISSING
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@282.91:289.70 BUT IT SOON BECAME CLEAR THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN WOULD EMERGE AS THE UNDISPUTED CAPTAIN OF THIS UNRULY TEAM
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@290.05:299.95 FOR EACH OF THEM SOON CAME TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE POSSESSED AN UNPARALLELED ARRAY OF EMOTIONAL STRENGTHS AND POLITICAL SKILLS THAT PROVED FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE THINNESS OF HIS EXTERNAL
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@301.00:312.20 FOR ONE THING HE POSSESSED AN UNCANNY ABILITY TO EMPATHIZE WITH AND TO THINK ABOUT OTHER PEOPLES POINT OF VIEW HE REPAIRED INJURED FEELINGS THAT MIGHT HAVE ESCALATED INTO PERMANENT HOSTILITY HE SHARED CREDIT WITH
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@312.86:323.37 ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FAILURE OF HIS SUBORDINATES CONSTANTLY ACKNOWLEDGED HIS ERRORS AND LEARNED FROM HIS MISTAKES THESE ARE THE QUALITIES WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR IN OUR CANDIDATES IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@323.64:325.12 HE REFUSED TO BE PROVOKED
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@327.64:336.01 BY PETTY GRIEVANCES HE NEVER SUBMITTED TO JEALOUSY OR BROODED OVER PERCEIVED SLIGHTS AND HE EXPRESSED HIS UNSHAKEABLE CONVICTIONS
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@336.39:346.80 IN EVERYDAY LANGUAGE IN METAPHORS IN STORIES AND WITH A BEAUTY OF LANGUAGE ALMOST AS IF THE SHAKESPEARE AND THE POETRY HE HAD SO LOVED AS A CHILD HAD WORKED THEIR WAY INTO HIS VERY SOUL
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@363.96:372.27 BUT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO PUT HIS SIGNATURE ON THE PROCLAMATION HIS OWN HAND WAS NUMB AND SHAKING BECAUSE HE HAD SHAKEN A THOUSAND HANDS THAT MORNING AT A NEW YEAR 'S RECEPTION
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@372.53:385.45 SO HE PUT THE PEN DOWN HE SAID IF EVER MY SOUL WERE IN AN ACT IT IS IN THIS ACT BUT IF I SIGN WITH A SHAKING HAND POSTERITY WILL SAY HE HESITATED SO HE WAITED UNTIL HE COULD TAKE UP THE PEN AND SIGN WITH A BOLD AND CLEAR HAND
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@386.05:398.35 BUT EVEN IN HIS WILDEST DREAMS LINCOLN COULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED HOW FAR HIS REPUTATION WOULD REACH I WAS SO THRILLED TO FIND AN INTERVIEW WITH THE GREAT RUSSIAN WRITER LEO TOLSTOY IN A NEW YORK NEWSPAPER IN THE EARLY NINETEEN
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@399.08:407.77 AND IN IT TOLSTOY TOLD OF A TRIP THAT HE'D RECENTLY MADE TO A VERY REMOTE AREA OF THE CAUCASUS WHERE THERE WERE ONLY WILD BARBARIANS WHO HAD NEVER LEFT THIS PART OF RUSSIA
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@408.25:418.04 KNOWING THAT TOLSTOY WAS IN THEIR MIDST THEY ASKED HIM TO TELL STORIES OF THE GREAT MEN OF HISTORY SO HE SAID I TOLD THEM ABOUT NAPOLEON AND ALEXANDER THE GREAT AND FREDERICK THE GREAT AND JULIUS CAESAR AND THEY LOVED IT
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@418.27:423.95 BUT BEFORE I FINISHED THE CHIEF OF THE BARBARIANS STOOD UP AND SAID BUT WAIT YOU HAVEN'T TOLD US ABOUT THE GREATEST RULER OF
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@425.01:437.24 WE WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THAT MAN WHO SPOKE WITH A VOICE OF THUNDER WHO LAUGHED LIKE THE SUNRISE WHO CAME FROM THAT PLACE CALLED AMERICA WHICH IS SO FAR FROM HERE THAT IF A YOUNG MAN SHOULD TRAVEL THERE HE WOULD BE AN OLD MAN WHEN HE ARRIVED
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@437.55:445.48 TELL US OF THAT MAN TELL US OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN HE WAS STUNNED HE TOLD THEM EVERYTHING HE COULD ABOUT LINCOLN AND THEN IN THE INTERVIEW HE SAID WHAT MADE LINCOLN SO GREAT
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@445.89:457.62 NOT AS GREAT A GENERAL AS NAPOLEON NOT AS GREAT A STATESMAN AS FREDERICK THE GREAT BUT HIS GREATNESS CONSISTED AND HISTORIANS WOULD ROUNDLY AGREE IN THE INTEGRITY OF HIS CHARACTER AND THE MORAL FIBER OF HIS BEING
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@458.02:467.40 SO IN THE END THAT POWERFUL AMBITION THAT HAD CARRIED LINCOLN THROUGH HIS BLEAK CHILDHOOD HAD BEEN REALIZED THAT AMBITION THAT HAD ALLOWED HIM TO LABORIOUSLY EDUCATE HIMSELF BY HIMSELF
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@467.79:473.76 TO GO THROUGH THAT STRING OF POLITICAL FAILURES AND THE DARKEST DAYS OF THE WAR HIS STORY WOULD BE TOLD
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@474.36:482.78 SO AS FOR THAT SECOND SPHERE NOT OF WORK BUT OF LOVE ENCOMPASSING FAMILY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES IT TOO TAKES WORK AND COMMITMENT
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@483.31:487.74 THE LYNDON JOHNSON THAT I SAW IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE WHEN I HELPED HIM ON HIS MEMOIRS
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@500.52:514.32 MY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM BEGAN ON A RATHER CURIOUS LEVEL I WAS SELECTED AS A WHITE HOUSE FELLOW WHEN I WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD WE HAD A BIG DANCE AT THE WHITE HOUSE PRESIDENT JOHNSON DID DANCE WITH ME THAT NIGHT NOT THAT PECULIAR THERE WERE ONLY THREE WOMEN OUT OF THE SIXTEEN WHITE HOUSE FELLOWS
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@514.72:522.45 BUT HE DID WHISPER IN MY EAR THAT HE WANTED ME TO WORK DIRECTLY FOR HIM IN THE WHITE HOUSE BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE THAT SIMPLE FOR IN THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO MY SELECTION
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@522.78:532.11 LIKE MANY YOUNG PEOPLE I'D BEEN ACTIVE IN THE ANTI VIETNAM WAR MOVEMENT AND HAD WRITTEN AN ARTICLE AGAINST LYNDON JOHNSON WHICH UNFORTUNATELY CAME OUT IN THE NEW REPUBLIC TWO DAYS AFTER THE DANCE IN THE WHITE HOUSE
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@533.34:536.62 THE THEME OF THE ARTICLE WAS HOW TO REMOVE LYNDON JOHNSON FROM POWER
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@543.74:552.34 IF I CAN'T WIN HER OVER NO ONE CAN SO I DID END UP WORKING FOR HIM IN THE WHITE HOUSE EVENTUALLY ACCOMPANIED HIM TO HIS RANCH TO HELP HIM ON THOSE MEMOIRS NEVER FULLY UNDERSTANDING
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@565.72:568.70 THEY WERE GREAT NONETHELESS SO I THINK THAT PART OF
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@605.97:612.01 WAS PRETTY EMBARRASSING GIVEN WHAT WAS GOING ON IN MY MIND BUT I MUST SAY THE OLDER I'VE
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@612.39:620.33 THE MORE I REALIZE WHAT AN INCREDIBLE PRIVILEGE IT WAS TO HAVE SPENT SO MANY HOURS WITH THIS AGING LION OF A MAN A VICTOR IN A THOUSAND CONTESTS
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@620.61:627.20 THREE GREAT CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS MEDICARE AID TO EDUCATION AND YET ROUNDLY DEFEATED IN THE END BY THE WAR IN VIETNAM
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@627.55:636.42 AND BECAUSE HE WAS SO SAD AND SO VULNERABLE HE OPENED UP TO ME IN WAYS HE NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD I KNOW HIM AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWER SHARING HIS FEARS HIS SORROWS AND HIS WORRIES
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@655.45:662.91 THE SURFACE LYNDON JOHNSON SHOULD HAVE HAD EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT IN THOSE LAST YEARS IN THE SENSE THAT HE HAD BEEN ELECTED TO THE PRESIDENCY
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@663.26:676.86 HE HAD ALL THE MONEY HE NEEDED TO PURSUE ANY LEISURE ACTIVITY HE WANTED HE OWNED A SPACIOUS RANCH IN THE COUNTRYSIDE A PENTHOUSE IN THE CITY SAILBOATS SPEEDBOATS HE HAD SERVANTS TO ANSWER ANY WHIM AND HE HAD A FAMILY WHO LOVED HIM DEEPLY
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@677.16:688.45 AND YET YEARS OF CONCENTRATION SOLELY ON WORK AND INDIVIDUAL SUCCESS MEANT THAT IN HIS RETIREMENT HE COULD FIND NO SOLACE IN FAMILY IN RECREATION IN SPORTS OR IN HOBBIES
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@688.89:700.97 WAS ALMOST AS IF THE HOLE IN HIS HEART WAS SO LARGE THAT EVEN THE LOVE OF A FAMILY WITHOUT WORK COULD NOT FILL IT AS HIS SPIRITS SAGGED HIS BODY DETERIORATED UNTIL I BELIEVE HE SLOWLY BROUGHT ABOUT HIS OWN DEATH
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@701.61:713.97 IN THOSE LAST YEARS HE SAID HE WAS SO SAD WATCHING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LOOK TOWARD A NEW PRESIDENT AND FORGETTING HIM HE SPOKE WITH IMMENSE SADNESS IN HIS VOICE SAYING MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE SPENT MORE TIME WITH HIS CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN IN TURN
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@714.29:722.03 BUT IT WAS TOO LATE DESPITE ALL THAT POWER ALL THAT WEALTH HE WAS ALONE WHEN HE FINALLY DIED HIS ULTIMATE TERROR REALIZED
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@722.63:732.51 SO AS FOR THAT THIRD SPHERE OF PLAY WHICH HE NEVER HAD LEARNED TO ENJOY I'VE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS THAT EVEN THIS SPHERE REQUIRES A COMMITMENT OF TIME AND ENERGY ENOUGH
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@732.78:742.22 SO THAT A HOBBY A SPORT A LOVE OF MUSIC OR ART OR LITERATURE OR ANY FORM OF RECREATION CAN PROVIDE TRUE PLEASURE RELAXATION AND REPLENISHMENT
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@742.65:751.50 SO DEEP FOR INSTANCE WAS ABRAHAM LINCOLN 'S LOVE OF SHAKESPEARE THAT HE MADE TIME TO SPEND MORE THAN A HUNDRED NIGHTS IN THE THEATRE EVEN DURING THOSE DARK DAYS OF THE WAR
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@751.88:759.75 HE SAID WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT DOWN AND A SHAKESPEARE PLAY CAME ON FOR A FEW PRECIOUS HOURS HE COULD IMAGINE HIMSELF BACK IN PRINCE HAL 'S TIME
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@760.18:768.47 BUT AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT FORM OF RELAXATION FOR HIM THAT LYNDON JOHNSON NEVER COULD ENJOY WAS A LOVE OF SOMEHOW HUMOR AND
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@768.84:776.89 FEELING OUT WHAT HILARIOUS PARTS OF LIFE CAN PRODUCE AS SIDE LIGHT TO THE SADNESS HE ONCE SAID THAT HE LAUGHED SO HE DID NOT CRY
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@777.20:788.58 THAT A GOOD STORY FOR HIM WAS BETTER THAN A DROP OF WHISKEY HIS STORYTELLING POWERS HAD FIRST BEEN RECOGNIZED WHEN HE WAS ON THE CIRCUIT IN ILLINOIS THE LAWYERS AND THE JUDGES WOULD TRAVEL FROM ONE COUNTY COURTHOUSE TO THE OTHER
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@789.03:799.46 AND WHEN ANYONE WAS KNOWING LINCOLN WAS IN TOWN THEY WOULD COME FROM MILES AROUND TO LISTEN TO HIM TELL STORIES HE WOULD STAND WITH HIS BACK AGAINST A FIRE AND ENTERTAIN THE CROWD FOR HOURS WITH HIS WINDING TALES
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@799.79:807.34 AND ALL THESE STORIES BECAME PART OF HIS MEMORY BANK SO HE COULD CALL ON THEM WHENEVER HE NEEDED TO AND THEY'RE NOT QUITE WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM OUR MARBLE MONUMENT
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@807.60:819.32 ONE OF HIS FAVORITE STORIES FOR EXAMPLE HAD TO DO WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR HERO ETHAN ALLEN AND AS LINCOLN TOLD THE STORY MISTER ALLEN WENT TO BRITAIN AFTER THE WAR AND THE BRITISH PEOPLE WERE STILL UPSET ABOUT LOSING THE REVOLUTION SO
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@819.80:832.27 TO EMBARRASS HIM A LITTLE BIT BY PUTTING A HUGE PICTURE OF GENERAL WASHINGTON IN THE ONLY OUTHOUSE WHERE HE'D HAVE TO ENCOUNTER IT THEY FIGURED HE'D BE UPSET ABOUT THE INDIGNITY OF GEORGE WASHINGTON BEING IN AN OUTHOUSE BUT HE CAME OUT OF THE OUTHOUSE NOT UPSET AT ALL
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@849.92:859.46 SO YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A TENSE CABINET MEETING AND HE HAD HUNDREDS OF THESE STORIES YOU WOULD HAVE TO RELAX SO BETWEEN HIS
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@859.67:870.22 NIGHTLY TREKS TO THE THEATRE HIS STORY TELLING AND HIS EXTRAORDINARY SENSE OF HUMOR AND HIS LOVE OF QUOTING SHAKESPEARE AND POETRY HE FOUND THAT FORM OF PLAY WHICH CARRIED HIM THROUGH HIS DAYS
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@870.72:884.11 IN MY OWN LIFE I SHALL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL FOR HAVING FOUND A FORM OF PLAY IN MY IRRATIONAL LOVE OF BASEBALL WHICH ALLOWS ME FROM THE BEGINNING OF SPRING TRAINING TO THE END OF THE FALL TO HAVE SOMETHING TO OCCUPY MY MIND AND HEART OTHER THAN MY WORK
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@884.49:896.88 IT ALL BEGAN WHEN I WAS ONLY SIX YEARS OLD AND MY FATHER TAUGHT ME THAT MYSTERIOUS ART OF KEEPING SCORE WHILE LISTENING TO BASEBALL GAMES SO THAT WHEN HE WENT TO WORK IN NEW YORK DURING THE DAY I COULD RECORD FOR HIM THE HISTORY OF THAT AFTERNOON 'S BROOKLYN DODGERS GAME
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@907.71:914.71 BUT HE MADE ME FEEL I WAS TELLING HIM A FABULOUS STORY IT MAKES YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING MAGIC ABOUT HISTORY TO KEEP YOUR FATHER 'S ATTENTION
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@915.01:924.09 IN FACT I'M CONVINCED I LEARNED THE NARRATIVE ART FROM THOSE NIGHTLY SESSIONS WITH MY FATHER BECAUSE AT FIRST I'D BE SO EXCITED I WOULD BLURT OUT THE DODGERS WON OR THE DODGERS LOST WHICH TOOK MUCH OF THE DRAMA
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@926.20:926.92 SO I FINALLY
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@927.11:938.32 YOU HAD TO TELL A STORY FROM BEGINNING TO MIDDLE TO END I MUST SAY SO FERVENT WAS MY LOVE OF THE OLD BROOKLYN DODGERS IN THOSE DAYS THAT I HAD TO CONFESS IN MY FIRST CONFESSION TWO SINS THAT RELATED TO BASEBALL
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@938.57:946.49 THE FIRST OCCURRED BECAUSE THE DODGERS CATCHER ROY CAMPANELLA CAME TO MY HOMETOWN OF ROCKVILLE CENTRE LONG ISLAND JUST AS I WAS IN PREPARATION FOR MY FIRST HOLY COMMUNION
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@947.04:958.07 AND I WAS SO EXCITED FIRST PERSON I'D EVER SEE OUTSIDE OF EBBETS FIELD BUT IT SO HAPPENED HE WAS SPEAKING IN A PROTESTANT CHURCH WHEN YOU ARE BROUGHT UP AS A CATHOLIC YOU THINK THAT IF YOU EVER SET FOOT IN A PROTESTANT CHURCH YOU'LL BE STRUCK DEAD AT THE THRESHOLD
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@978.48:986.02 I WENT TO MY FIRST CONFESSION I TOLD THE PRIEST RIGHT AWAY HE SAID NO PROBLEM IT WASN'T A RELIGIOUS SERVICE BUT THEN UNFORTUNATELY HE SAID AND WHAT ELSE MY CHILD
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@994.99:1008.58 AND I HAD TO SAY THAT I WISHED THAT VARIOUS NEW YORK YANKEES PLAYERS WOULD BREAK ARMS LEGS AND ANKLES SO THAT THE BROOKLYN DODGERS COULD WIN THEIR FIRST WORLD SERIES HE SAID HOW OFTEN DO YOU MAKE THESE HORRIBLE WISHES AND I HAD TO SAY EVERY NIGHT WHEN I SAID MY
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@1009.27:1010.11 SO HE SAID LOOK
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@1010.79:1022.14 YOU SOMETHING I LOVE THE BROOKLYN DODGERS AS YOU DO BUT I PROMISE YOU SOME DAY THEY WILL WIN FAIRLY AND SQUARELY YOU DO NOT NEED TO WISH HARM ON OTHERS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN OH YES I SAID BUT LUCKILY MY FIRST CONFESSION TO A BASEBALL LOVING PRIEST
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@1022.80:1024.55 WELL THOUGH MY FATHER DIED
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@1024.64:1034.45 OF A SUDDEN HEART ATTACK WHEN I WAS STILL IN MY TWENTIES BEFORE I HAD GOTTEN MARRIED AND HAD MY THREE SONS I HAVE PASSED HIS MEMORY AS WELL AS HIS LOVE OF BASEBALL ON TO MY
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@1035.09:1043.08 WHEN THE DODGERS ABANDONED US TO COME TO L A I LOST FAITH IN BASEBALL UNTIL I MOVED TO BOSTON AND BECAME AN IRRATIONAL RED SOCKS FAN
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@1043.48:1049.93 AND I MUST SAY EVEN NOW WHEN I SIT WITH MY SONS WITH OUR SEASON TICKETS I CAN SOMETIMES CLOSE MY EYES AGAINST THE SUN
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@1050.30:1060.34 AND IMAGINE MYSELF A YOUNG GIRL ONCE MORE IN THE PRESENCE OF MY FATHER WATCHING THE PLAYERS OF MY YOUTH ON THE GRASSY FIELDS BELOW JACKIE ROBINSON ROY CAMPANELLA PEE WEE REESE AND DUKE SNIDER
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@1060.73:1069.41 I MUST SAY THERE IS MAGIC IN THESE MOMENTS WHEN I OPEN MY EYES AND I SEE MY SONS IN THE PLACE WHERE MY FATHER ONCE SAT I FEEL AN INVISIBLE LOYALTY AND LOVE
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@1078.67:1090.42 WHICH IS WHY IN THE END I SHALL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL FOR THIS CURIOUS LOVE OF HISTORY ALLOWING ME TO SPEND A LIFETIME LOOKING BACK INTO THE PAST ALLOWING ME TO LEARN FROM THESE LARGE FIGURES ABOUT THE STRUGGLE FOR MEANING FOR LIFE
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@1090.93:1100.33 ALLOWING ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE PRIVATE PEOPLE WE HAVE LOVED AND LOST IN OUR FAMILIES AND THE PUBLIC FIGURES WE HAVE RESPECTED IN OUR HISTORY JUST AS ABRAHAM LINCOLN WANTED TO BELIEVE
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008@1100.73:1108.16 REALLY CAN LIVE ON SO LONG AS WE PLEDGE TO TELL AND TO RETELL THE STORIES OF THEIR LIVES THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME BE THAT
