ErnestMadu_2007G@13.09:21.55 IT IS INTERESTING THAT IN THE UNITED STATES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HEALTHCARE BUDGET GOES TO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CARE WHETHER IT'S PRIVATE
ErnestMadu_2007G@22.38:34.60 PUBLIC THERE'S NO COMPARISON AT ALL IN AFRICA WHERE IT IS A MAJOR KILLER IT IS TOTALLY IGNORED AND THAT SITUATION CANNOT BE RIGHT
ErnestMadu_2007G@35.10:42.44 WE MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT HEALTH STATUS OF A NATION PARALLELS DEVELOPMENT OF THAT
ErnestMadu_2007G@54.74:68.14 IS IN AFRICA EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF GLOBAL DISEASE BURDEN FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES NOT IN THE WEST AND YET NINETY PERCENT OF THE RESOURCES ARE IN THE WEST WHO IS AT RISK
ErnestMadu_2007G@68.97:82.55 PEOPLE LIKE YOU IT'S NOT JUST THE AFRICANS THAT SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT ALL FRIENDS OF AFRICA THAT WILL HAVE REASON TO BE IN AFRICA AT SOME POINT IN TIME SHOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS DEPLORABLE SITUATION

ErnestMadu_2007G@129.50:137.81 AFTER THE TIME THAT THEY REACH ABOUT FORTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND FIFTY YEARS OLD AND THOSE ARE THE TIMES THEY'RE MOST PRODUCTIVE
ErnestMadu_2007G@149.85:154.72 IF YOU CANNOT SECURE THE PARENTS YOU CANNOT GRANT THE SECURITY OF THE AFRICAN CHILD

ErnestMadu_2007G@194.46:205.51 WE CANNOT MAKE THE MISTAKES WE'VE MADE WITH MALARIA AND HIV IN EIGHT SHORT YEARS NON COMMUNICABLE DISEASES WILL BECOME THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH IN AFRICA
ErnestMadu_2007G@205.91:215.24 THAT IS SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND WE CAN'T DEAL WITH IT WITH SITUATIONS LIKE THIS THIS IS A TYPICAL AFRICAN HOSPITAL WE CAN'T DEPEND ON THE ELITES THEY GO

ErnestMadu_2007G@234.81:247.48 TO FIX THOSE PROBLEMS YOU CAN'T RIGHTLY IT'S NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF MY OWN PROBLEMS IF THEY HELP THAT'S GOOD BUT THAT IS NOT MY EXPECTATION
ErnestMadu_2007G@247.91:256.39 THESE WORSENING INDICES OF HEALTHCARE OR HEALTH STUDIES IN AFRICA DEMAND A NEW LOOK WE CANNOT KEEP ON DOING THINGS THE WAY WE'VE ALWAYS DONE THEM
ErnestMadu_2007G@256.67:265.61 IF THEY HAVE NOT WORKED WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOLUTIONS THIS HAS BEEN WHAT HAS BEEN A

ErnestMadu_2007G@433.14:435.61 AND I WILL TELL YOU HOW WE'RE ABLE TO DO IT
ErnestMadu_2007G@436.21:449.39 WE MAKE SURE THAT WE SELECT OUR EQUIPMENT PROPERLY WE GO FOR MODULAR UNITS UNITS THAT HAVE MULTI MODALITY FUNCTIONS HAVE MODULAR COMPONENTS EASY TO REPAIR AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE DO NOT
ErnestMadu_2007G@449.90:464.18 TAKE THINGS THAT ARE NOT DURABLE AND CANNOT LAST WE EMPHASIZE TRAINING AND WE MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROCESS IS REGENERATIVE VERY SOON WE WILL ALL BE DEAD AND GONE BUT THE PROBLEMS WILL STAY UNLESS WE HAVE PEOPLE TAKING OVER FROM WHERE WE STOPPED
ErnestMadu_2007G@464.90:476.74 WE MADE SURE THAT WE PRODUCED SOME THINGS OURSELVES WE DO NOT BUY UNIT DOSES OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS WE GET THE GENERATORS FROM THE COMPANIES WE MANUFACTURE THEM IN HOUSE OURSELVES
ErnestMadu_2007G@477.05:488.24 THAT KEEPS THE COSTS DOWN SO FOR A RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL IN THE US THAT YOU'LL GET A UNIT DOSE FOR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS WHEN WE'RE FINISHED MANUFACTURING IT IN HOUSE WE COME AT A PRICE OF ABOUT TWO
ErnestMadu_2007G@492.55:506.10 WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE RICH AND POOR COUNTRIES IS THROUGH EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY ALL THESE PROBLEMS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IF WE BRING DEVELOPMENT THEY WILL ALL DISAPPEAR
ErnestMadu_2007G@515.62:523.10 THE RURAL CENTERS AND WE CAN USE EXPERTISE IN A VERY SMART WAY THIS IS THE WAY OUR CENTERS ARE SET UP
ErnestMadu_2007G@523.40:532.40 WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE LOCATIONS IN THE CARIBBEAN AND WE'RE PLANNING A FOURTH ONE AND WE HAVE NOW DECIDED TO GO INTO AFRICA WE WILL BE DOING
ErnestMadu_2007G@532.70:542.58 THE WEST AFRICAN HEART INSTITUTE IN PORT HARCOURT NIGERIA THAT PROJECT WILL BE STARTING WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WE HOPE TO OPEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT NINE AND WE WILL DO
ErnestMadu_2007G@543.89:550.05 THIS MODEL CAN BE ADAPTED TO EVERY DISEASE PROCESS ALL THE UNITS ALL THE CENTERS ARE LINKED THROUGH
ErnestMadu_2007G@552.77:559.63 CENTRAL SERVER AND ALL THE IMAGES ARE POPULATED TO REVIEW STATIONS AND WE DESIGNED THIS TELEMEDICINE SOLUTION
ErnestMadu_2007G@560.33:568.64 TO US AND WE ARE HAPPY TO SHARE WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED WITH ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN DOING IT YOU CAN STILL BE PROFITABLE
ErnestMadu_2007G@582.00:585.47 TO SEE HOW THIS HAPPENS THIS IS AT THE HEART INSTITUTE
ErnestMadu_2007G@585.76:599.97 THE DOCTORS FROM ANYWHERE CAN LOG IN I CAN CALL YOU IN SWITZERLAND AND SAY LISTEN GO INTO OUR SYSTEM LOOK AT MISTERS JONES LOOK AT THE STUDY TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK THEY'LL GIVE ME THAT INFORMATION AND WE'LL MAKE THE CARE OF THE
ErnestMadu_2007G@600.72:609.50 BETTER THE PATIENT DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL HE DOESN'T HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THE ANXIETY OF NOT KNOWING BECAUSE OF LIMITED EXPERTISE
ErnestMadu_2007G@610.10:621.57 WE ALSO USE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD SYSTEM I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT THE THINGS WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED EIGHTY PERCENT OF US PRACTICES DO NOT HAVE THEM
ErnestMadu_2007G@622.12:631.47 AND YET THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE BUT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THAT LUXURY BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T GET IT IN NASHVILLE YOU CAN TRAVEL TO BIRMINGHAM TWO HOURS AWAY AND YOU'LL GET IT
ErnestMadu_2007G@631.67:638.25 IF YOU CAN'T GET IT IN CLEVELAND YOU CAN GO TO CINCINNATI WE DON'T HAVE THAT LUXURY SO WE HAVE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
ErnestMadu_2007G@638.55:649.42 WHEN WE DO IT WE WILL PUT THE COST OF CARE DOWN AND WE'LL EXTEND IT TO THE RURAL CENTERS AND MAKE IT AFFORDABLE AND EVERYONE WILL GET THE CARE THEY DESERVE
ErnestMadu_2007G@650.32:660.79 IT CANNOT JUST BE TECHNOLOGY WE RECOGNIZE THAT PREVENTION MUST BE PART OF THE SOLUTION WE EMPHASIZE THAT BUT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT CAN BE DONE
ErnestMadu_2007G@661.09:668.61 IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO TELL PEOPLE TO DO WHAT IS GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE AND THEY GO HOME AND CAN'T DO IT THEY NEED TO BE ALIVE THEY NEED TO FEED
ErnestMadu_2007G@669.03:676.80 WE RECOMMEND EXERCISE AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE SIMPLE EASY THING TO DO WE HAVE HAD WALKS
ErnestMadu_2007G@677.34:683.65 EVERY YEAR EVERY MARCH APRIL WE FORM PEOPLE INTO GROUPS AND MAKE THEM GO INTO CHALLENGES
ErnestMadu_2007G@683.96:692.12 WHICH GROUP LOSES THE MOST WEIGHT WE GIVE THEM PRIZES WHICH GROUPS RECORD MORE WALKING DISTANCE BY PEDOMETER WE GIVE THEM PRIZES
ErnestMadu_2007G@692.32:705.12 WE DO THIS CONSTANTLY WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO BRING CHILDREN THAT WAY WE START EXPOSING THE CHILDREN FROM VERY EARLY ON ON WHAT THESE ISSUES ARE BECAUSE ONCE THEY LEARN IT THEY WILL STAY WITH IT
ErnestMadu_2007G@705.43:717.95 IN DOING THIS WE HAVE CREATED AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED SKILLED JOBS IN JAMAICA ALONE AND THESE ARE PHYSICIANS WITH EXPERTISE AND SPECIAL TRAINING WE HAVE TAKEN CARE OF OVER ONE THOUSAND INDIGENT PATIENTS THAT COULD HAVE DIED
ErnestMadu_2007G@727.53:734.36 IF YOU DON'T GET THIS PACEMAKER YOU WILL BE DEAD SO WE ARE PLEASED WITH THAT INDIRECTLY WE HAVE SAVED THE GOVERNMENT OF JAMAICA
ErnestMadu_2007G@734.67:743.07 FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM PEOPLE THAT WOULD HAVE GONE TO MIAMI OR ATLANTA FOR CARE AND WE'VE HOPEFULLY SAVED A LOT OF LIVES
ErnestMadu_2007G@752.97:762.70 EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT DO THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE COMPETING NEEDS THEY NEED TO PUT RESOURCES ELSEWHERE BUT WE CAN STILL DO IT
ErnestMadu_2007G@763.27:774.48 BECAUSE PEOPLE SAY HOW CAN YOU DO THAT THIS IS HOW WE CAN DO THAT AT LEAST FOUR THOUSAND RICH JAMAICANS THAT WERE HEADING TO MIAMI FOR TREATMENT HAVE SELF CONFESSED
ErnestMadu_2007G@775.09:784.17 THAT THEY DID NOT GO TO MIAMI BECAUSE OF THE HEART INSTITUTE OF THE CARIBBEAN AND IF THEY WENT TO MIAMI THEY WILL SPEND SIGNIFICANTLY MORE
ErnestMadu_2007G@784.63:791.80 TO TEN TIMES MORE AND THEY FEEL HAPPY SPENDING IT AT HOME GETTING THE SAME QUALITY OF CARE AND FOR THAT
ErnestMadu_2007G@792.41:800.91 FOR EVERY ONE PATIENT THAT HAS THE MONEY TO PAY IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE CARE OF AT LEAST FOUR PEOPLE THAT DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO
ErnestMadu_2007G@807.58:817.34 THIS TO WORK THIS PROGRESS MUST BE SUSTAINABLE SO WE EMPHASIZE TRAINING TRAINING IS CRITICAL WE HAVE GONE FURTHER WE HAVE FORMED A RELATIONSHIP
ErnestMadu_2007G@836.72:843.28 HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY TRAINING PROGRAMS TRAINING PEOPLE IN ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY CARDIAC ULTRASOUND THOSE KIND OF THINGS
ErnestMadu_2007G@851.33:859.80 KIND OF STUFF IN THE PROCESS I WANT YOU TO JUST HEAR FROM THE TRAINEES THEMSELVES WHAT IT HAS MEANT FOR THEM
ErnestMadu_2007G@860.56:866.55 JASON TOPPING I'M A SENIOR RESIDENT IN ANESTHESIA IN INTENSIVE CARE AT THE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL OF THE WEST INDIES
ErnestMadu_2007G@867.12:874.88 I CAME TO THE HEART INSTITUTE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AS PART OF MY ELECTIVE IN MY ANESTHESIA AND INTENSIVE CARE PROGRAM

ErnestMadu_2007G@892.18:896.54 I AM AN ECHOCARDIOGRAPHER AT THE HEART INSTITUTE OF THE CARIBBEAN
ErnestMadu_2007G@897.09:898.01 SINCE THE PAST
ErnestMadu_2007G@904.41:911.67 ASPECT OF TRAINING IN CARDIOLOGY THAT THE HEART INSTITUTE OF THE CARIBBEAN HAS INTRODUCED IN JAMAICA
ErnestMadu_2007G@913.59:915.22 VERY IMPORTANT
ErnestMadu_2007G@915.78:919.36 IN TERMS OF DIAGNOSING CARDIAC DISEASES
ErnestMadu_2007G@920.09:932.99 THE LESSON IN THIS IS THAT IT CAN BE DONE AND IT CAN BE SUSTAINED AND YOU CAN MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR EVERYONE WHO ARE WE TO DECIDE THAT POOR PEOPLE CANNOT GET THE BEST CARE
ErnestMadu_2007G@934.01:941.85 WHEN HAVE YOU BEEN APPOINTED TO PLAY GOD IT IS NOT MY DECISION MY JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY PERSON
ErnestMadu_2007G@942.04:949.93 NO MATTER WHAT FATE HAS ASSIGNED TO YOU WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE BEST QUALITY HEALTHCARE IN LIFE
