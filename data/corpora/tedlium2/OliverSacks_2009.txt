OliverSacks_2009@16.30:25.11 WE SEE WITH THE EYES BUT WE SEE WITH THE BRAIN AS WELL AND SEEING WITH THE BRAIN IS OFTEN CALLED IMAGINATION
OliverSacks_2009@26.52:33.83 AND WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE LANDSCAPES OF OUR OWN IMAGINATION OUR INSCAPES WE'VE LIVED WITH THEM ALL OUR LIVES
OliverSacks_2009@34.69:47.42 BUT THERE ARE ALSO HALLUCINATIONS AS WELL AND HALLUCINATIONS ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE OF OUR CREATION THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE UNDER OUR CONTROL THEY SEEM TO COME FROM THE OUTSIDE
OliverSacks_2009@48.01:57.24 AND TO MIMIC PERCEPTION SO I AM GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HALLUCINATIONS AND A PARTICULAR SORT OF VISUAL HALLUCINATION
OliverSacks_2009@59.15:62.33 WHICH I SEE AMONG MY PATIENTS
OliverSacks_2009@64.07:76.07 FEW MONTHS AGO I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM A NURSING HOME WHERE I WORK THEY TOLD ME THAT ONE OF THE RESIDENTS AN OLD LADY IN HER NINETIES WAS SEEING THINGS
OliverSacks_2009@77.00:89.08 AND THEY WONDERED IF SHE'D GONE BONKERS OR BECAUSE SHE WAS AN OLD LADY WHETHER SHE'D HAD A STROKE OR WHETHER SHE HAD ALZHEIMER 'S AND SO THEY ASKED ME IF I WOULD COME AND SEE ROSALIE
OliverSacks_2009@89.90:93.09 THE OLD LADY I WENT IN TO SEE HER
OliverSacks_2009@94.10:101.76 WAS EVIDENT STRAIGHT AWAY THAT SHE WAS PERFECTLY SANE AND LUCID AND OF GOOD INTELLIGENCE
OliverSacks_2009@102.20:107.56 BUT SHE'D BEEN VERY STARTLED AND VERY BEWILDERED BECAUSE SHE'D BEEN SEEING THINGS
OliverSacks_2009@109.79:123.65 SHE TOLD ME THE NURSES HADN'T MENTIONED THIS THAT SHE WAS BLIND THAT SHE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY BLIND FROM MACULAR DEGENERATION FOR FIVE YEARS BUT NOW FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS SHE'D BEEN SEEING THINGS
OliverSacks_2009@124.13:133.04 SO I SAID WHAT SORT OF THINGS AND SHE SAID PEOPLE IN EASTERN DRESS IN DRAPES WALKING UP AND DOWN STAIRS
OliverSacks_2009@133.65:142.31 A MAN WHO TURNS TOWARDS ME AND SMILES BUT HE HAS HUGE TEETH ON ONE SIDE OF HIS MOUTH ANIMALS TOO
OliverSacks_2009@142.92:149.75 I SEE A WHITE BUILDING IT'S SNOWING A SOFT SNOW I SEE THIS HORSE WITH A HARNESS DRAGGING THE SNOW AWAY
OliverSacks_2009@150.95:159.12 THEN ONE NIGHT THE SCENE CHANGES I SEE CATS AND DOGS WALKING TOWARDS ME THEY COME TO A CERTAIN POINT AND THEN STOP
OliverSacks_2009@159.99:169.00 THEN IT CHANGES AGAIN I SEE A LOT OF CHILDREN THEY ARE WALKING UP AND DOWN STAIRS THEY WEAR BRIGHT COLORS ROSE AND BLUE LIKE EASTERN DRESS
OliverSacks_2009@170.56:179.23 SOMETIMES SHE SAID BEFORE THE PEOPLE COME ON SHE MAY HALLUCINATE PINK AND BLUE SQUARES ON THE FLOOR WHICH SEEM TO GO UP TO THE CEILING
OliverSacks_2009@182.54:187.84 I SAID IS THIS LIKE A DREAM AND SHE SAID NO IT'S NOT LIKE A DREAM IT'S LIKE A MOVIE
OliverSacks_2009@188.28:196.37 SHE SAID IT 'S GOT COLOR IT'S GOT MOTION BUT IT'S COMPLETELY SILENT LIKE A SILENT MOVIE AND SHE SAID THAT IT'S A RATHER BORING MOVIE
OliverSacks_2009@196.49:203.59 SHE SAID ALL THESE PEOPLE WITH EASTERN DRESS WALKING UP AND DOWN VERY REPETITIVE VERY LIMITED
OliverSacks_2009@206.79:215.21 SHE HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR SHE KNEW IT WAS A HALLUCINATION BUT SHE WAS FRIGHTENED SHE'D LIVED NINETY FIVE YEARS AND SHE'D NEVER HAD A HALLUCINATION BEFORE
OliverSacks_2009@216.04:222.46 SHE SAID THAT THE HALLUCINATIONS WERE UNRELATED TO ANYTHING SHE WAS THINKING OR FEELING OR DOING
OliverSacks_2009@223.23:232.60 THAT THEY SEEMED TO COME ON BY THEMSELVES OR DISAPPEAR SHE HAD NO CONTROL OVER THEM SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ANY OF THE PEOPLE OR PLACES
OliverSacks_2009@240.62:250.80 AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON SHE WONDERED IF SHE WAS GOING MAD OR LOSING HER MIND WELL I EXAMINED HER CAREFULLY SHE WAS A BRIGHT OLD LADY
OliverSacks_2009@251.73:259.32 PERFECTLY SANE SHE HAD NO MEDICAL PROBLEMS SHE WASN'T ON ANY MEDICATIONS WHICH COULD PRODUCE HALLUCINATIONS BUT SHE WAS BLIND
OliverSacks_2009@261.19:272.38 AND I THEN SAID TO HER I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE I SAID THERE IS A SPECIAL FORM OF VISUAL HALLUCINATION WHICH MAY GO WITH DETERIORATING VISION OR BLINDNESS
OliverSacks_2009@273.07:280.15 THIS WAS ORIGINALLY DESCRIBED I SAID BACK IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY BY A MAN CALLED CHARLES BONNET
OliverSacks_2009@280.50:288.32 AND YOU HAVE CHARLES BONNET SYNDROME THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH YOUR BRAIN THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH YOUR MIND YOU HAVE CHARLES BONNET SYNDROME
OliverSacks_2009@288.98:299.11 AND SHE WAS VERY RELIEVED AT THIS THAT THERE WAS NOTHING SERIOUSLY THE MATTER AND ALSO RATHER CURIOUS SHE SAID WHO
OliverSacks_2009@301.02:308.90 SHE SAID DID HE HAVE THEM HIMSELF AND SHE SAID TELL ALL THE NURSES THAT I HAVE CHARLES BONNET SYNDROME
OliverSacks_2009@315.52:324.86 WELL SO I DID TELL THE NURSES NOW THIS FOR ME IS A COMMON SITUATION I WORK IN OLD AGE HOMES LARGELY I SEE A LOT OF ELDERLY PEOPLE
OliverSacks_2009@325.36:333.17 WHO ARE HEARING IMPAIRED OR VISUALLY IMPAIRED ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THE HEARING IMPAIRED PEOPLE GET MUSICAL HALLUCINATIONS
OliverSacks_2009@333.56:342.56 AND ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE GET VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY BLIND ONLY SUFFICIENTLY IMPAIRED
OliverSacks_2009@343.16:349.90 NOW WITH THE ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CHARLES BONNET DID NOT HAVE THEM HIS GRANDFATHER
OliverSacks_2009@350.21:359.05 HAD THESE HALLUCINATIONS HIS GRANDFATHER WAS A MAGISTRATE AN ELDERLY MAN HE'D HAD CATARACT SURGERY HIS VISION WAS PRETTY POOR
OliverSacks_2009@367.03:374.24 THE FIRST THING HE SAID WAS HE SAW A HANDKERCHIEF IN MIDAIR IT WAS LARGE BLUE HANDKERCHIEF WITH FOUR ORANGE CIRCLES
OliverSacks_2009@375.52:382.45 HE KNEW IT WAS A HALLUCINATION YOU DON'T HAVE HANDKERCHIEFS IN MIDAIR AND THEN HE SAW A BIG WHEEL IN MIDAIR
OliverSacks_2009@383.73:392.02 BUT SOMETIMES HE WASN'T SURE WHETHER HE WAS HALLUCINATING OR NOT BECAUSE THE HALLUCINATIONS WOULD FIT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE VISIONS
OliverSacks_2009@392.40:399.18 SO ON ONE OCCASION WHEN HIS GRANDDAUGHTERS WERE VISITING THEM HE SAID AND WHO ARE THESE HANDSOME YOUNG MEN WITH YOU
OliverSacks_2009@400.33:406.58 AND THEY SAID ALAS GRANDPAPA THERE ARE NO HANDSOME YOUNG MEN AND THEN THE HANDSOME YOUNG MEN
OliverSacks_2009@420.38:431.01 CHARLES LULLIN THE GRANDFATHER SAW HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT FIGURES DIFFERENT LANDSCAPES OF ALL SORTS ON ONE OCCASION HE SAW A MAN IN A BATHROBE SMOKING
OliverSacks_2009@431.85:433.20 AND REALIZED IT WAS
OliverSacks_2009@438.39:449.01 ON ONE OCCASION WHEN HE WAS WALKING IN THE STREETS OF PARIS HE SAW THIS WAS REAL A SCAFFOLDING BUT WHEN HE GOT BACK HOME HE SAW A MINIATURE OF THE SCAFFOLDING SIX INCHES HIGH
OliverSacks_2009@449.70:456.02 ON HIS STUDY TABLE THIS REPETITION OF PERCEPTION IS SOMETIMES CALLED PALINOPSIA
OliverSacks_2009@460.23:466.67 AND WITH ROSALIE WHAT SEEMS TO BE GOING ON AND ROSALIE SAID WHAT 'S GOING ON AND I SAID THAT AS
OliverSacks_2009@466.99:478.92 YOU LOSE VISION AS THE VISUAL PARTS OF THE BRAIN ARE NO LONGER GETTING ANY INPUT THEY BECOME HYPERACTIVE AND EXCITABLE AND THEY START TO FIRE SPONTANEOUSLY AND YOU START TO SEE THINGS
OliverSacks_2009@479.51:487.48 THE THINGS YOU SEE CAN BE VERY COMPLICATED INDEED WITH ANOTHER PATIENT OF MINE WHO HAD SOME
OliverSacks_2009@490.21:500.15 THE VISION SHE HAD COULD BE DISTURBING ON ONE OCCASION SHE SAID SHE SAW A MAN IN A STRIPED SHIRT IN A RESTAURANT AND HE TURNED AROUND AND THEN
OliverSacks_2009@500.36:509.38 HE DIVIDED INTO SIX IDENTICAL FIGURES IN STRIPED SHIRTS WHO STARTED WALKING TOWARDS HER AND THEN THE SIX FIGURES CAME TOGETHER AGAIN LIKE A CONCERTINA
OliverSacks_2009@509.80:521.46 ONCE WHEN SHE WAS DRIVING OR RATHER HER HUSBAND WAS DRIVING THE ROAD DIVIDED INTO FOUR AND SHE FELT HERSELF GOING SIMULTANEOUSLY UP FOUR ROADS SHE HAD VERY
OliverSacks_2009@523.60:531.41 HALLUCINATIONS AS WELL A LOT OF THEM HAD TO DO WITH A CAR SOMETIMES SHE WOULD SEE A TEENAGE BOY SITTING ON THE HOOD OF THE CAR
OliverSacks_2009@539.45:542.07 BOY WOULD DO A SUDDEN VERTICAL TAKE OFF ONE HUNDRED FOOT
OliverSacks_2009@542.92:544.19 AND THEN DISAPPEAR
OliverSacks_2009@545.95:555.16 ANOTHER PATIENT OF MINE HAD A DIFFERENT SORT OF HALLUCINATION THIS WAS A WOMAN WHO DIDN'T HAVE TROUBLE WITH HER EYES BUT THE VISUAL PARTS OF HER BRAIN
OliverSacks_2009@555.86:565.52 TUMOR IN THE OCCIPITAL CORTEX AND ABOVE ALL SHE WOULD SEE CARTOONS THESE CARTOONS
OliverSacks_2009@566.69:576.70 WOULD BE TRANSPARENT AND WOULD COVER HALF THE VISUAL FIELD LIKE A SCREEN AND ESPECIALLY SHE SAW CARTOONS OF KERMIT THE FROG
OliverSacks_2009@578.63:587.94 NOW I DON'T WATCH SESAME STREET BUT SHE MADE A POINT OF SAYING WHY KERMIT SHE SAID KERMIT THE FROG MEANS NOTHING TO ME
OliverSacks_2009@588.34:594.65 YOU KNOW I WAS WONDERING ABOUT FREUDIAN DETERMINANTS WHY KERMIT KERMIT THE FROG
OliverSacks_2009@594.77:603.99 MEANS NOTHING TO ME SHE DIDN'T MIND THE CARTOONS TOO MUCH BUT WHAT DID DISTURB HER WAS SHE GOT VERY PERSISTENT IMAGES OR HALLUCINATIONS OF FACES
OliverSacks_2009@604.33:613.21 AND AS WITH ROSALIE THE FACES WERE OFTEN DEFORMED WITH VERY LARGE TEETH OR VERY LARGE EYES AND THESE FRIGHTENED
OliverSacks_2009@614.76:627.45 WELL WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THESE PEOPLE AS A PHYSICIAN I HAVE TO TRY AND DEFINE WHAT'S GOING ON AND TO REASSURE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY TO REASSURE THEM THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING INSANE
OliverSacks_2009@636.29:644.96 ACKNOWLEDGE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID THEY WILL BE SEEN AS INSANE OR SOMETHING AND IF THEY DO MENTION THEM TO THEIR OWN DOCTORS THEY MAY BE MISDIAGNOSED
OliverSacks_2009@645.44:653.09 IN PARTICULAR THE NOTION IS THAT IF YOU SEE THINGS OR HEAR THINGS YOU'RE GOING MAD BUT THE PSYCHOTIC HALLUCINATIONS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT
OliverSacks_2009@653.56:662.66 PSYCHOTIC HALLUCINATIONS WHETHER THEY ARE VISUAL OR VOCAL THEY ADDRESS YOU THEY ACCUSE YOU THEY SEDUCE YOU THEY HUMILIATE YOU THEY JEER AT YOU
OliverSacks_2009@663.41:671.26 YOU INTERACT WITH THEM THERE IS NONE OF THIS QUALITY OF BEING ADDRESSED WITH THESE CHARLES BONNET HALLUCINATIONS
OliverSacks_2009@671.67:678.43 IS A FILM YOU'RE SEEING A FILM WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU OR THAT'S HOW PEOPLE THINK ABOUT IT
OliverSacks_2009@679.63:687.71 ALSO A RARE THING CALLED TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEPSY AND SOMETIMES IF ONE HAS THIS ONE MAY FEEL ONESELF TRANSPORTED BACK
OliverSacks_2009@687.97:699.65 TO A TIME AND PLACE IN THE PAST YOU'RE AT A PARTICULAR ROAD JUNCTION YOU SMELL CHESTNUTS ROASTING YOU HEAR THE TRAFFIC ALL THE SENSES ARE INVOLVED AND YOU'RE WAITING FOR YOUR GIRL
OliverSacks_2009@708.17:717.39 FULL OF FEELING FULL OF FAMILIARITY LOCATED IN SPACE AND TIME COHERENT DRAMATIC THE CHARLES BONNET ONES ARE QUITE DIFFERENT
OliverSacks_2009@717.85:729.65 SO IN THE CHARLES BONNET HALLUCINATIONS YOU HAVE ALL SORTS OF LEVELS FROM THE GEOMETRICAL HALLUCINATIONS THE PINK AND BLUE SQUARES THE WOMAN HAD UP TO
OliverSacks_2009@731.33:739.86 QUITE ELABORATE HALLUCINATIONS WITH FIGURES AND ESPECIALLY FACES FACES AND SOMETIMES DEFORMED FACES ARE THE SINGLE
OliverSacks_2009@746.99:748.83 SO WHAT IS GOING ON
OliverSacks_2009@760.46:768.13 AND IN FACT TO FIND THAT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE VISUAL BRAIN ARE ACTIVATED AS THEY ARE HALLUCINATING
OliverSacks_2009@768.42:777.38 WHEN PEOPLE HAVE THESE SIMPLE GEOMETRICAL HALLUCINATIONS THE PRIMARY VISUAL CORTEX IS ACTIVATED THIS IS THE PART OF THE BRAIN WHICH PERCEIVES
OliverSacks_2009@778.06:783.86 AND PATTERNS YOU DON'T FORM IMAGES WITH YOUR PRIMARY VISUAL CORTEX WHEN IMAGES
OliverSacks_2009@785.51:788.91 A HIGHER PART OF THE VISUAL CORTEX IS INVOLVED IN THE
OliverSacks_2009@791.30:804.20 AND IN PARTICULAR ONE AREA OF THE TEMPORAL LOBE IS CALLED THE FUSIFORM GYRUS AND IT'S KNOWN THAT IF PEOPLE HAVE DAMAGE IN THE FUSIFORM GYRUS THEY MAYBE LOSE THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE FACES
OliverSacks_2009@804.93:813.54 BUT IF THERE IS AN ABNORMAL ACTIVITY IN THE FUSIFORM GYRUS THEY MAY HALLUCINATE FACES AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU FIND IN SOME OF THESE PEOPLE
OliverSacks_2009@814.48:820.47 AREA IN THE ANTERIOR PART OF THIS GYRUS WHERE TEETH AND EYES
OliverSacks_2009@822.42:827.12 AND THAT PART OF THE GYRUS IS ACTIVATED WHEN PEOPLE GET
OliverSacks_2009@827.62:835.68 THE DEFORMED HALLUCINATIONS THERE IS ANOTHER PART OF THE BRAIN WHICH IS ESPECIALLY ACTIVATED WHEN ONE SEES CARTOONS
OliverSacks_2009@836.49:845.20 ACTIVATED WHEN ONE RECOGNIZES CARTOONS WHEN ONE DRAWS CARTOONS AND WHEN ONE HALLUCINATES THEM IT'S VERY INTERESTING THAT THAT SHOULD BE SPECIFIC
OliverSacks_2009@845.69:852.88 OTHER PARTS OF THE BRAIN WHICH ARE SPECIFICALLY INVOLVED WITH THE RECOGNITION AND HALLUCINATION OF BUILDINGS AND LANDSCAPES
OliverSacks_2009@863.31:871.12 AND NOW WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF OTHER SORTS OF CELLS WHICH CAN BE VERY VERY SPECIFIC SO YOU MAY NOT ONLY HAVE
OliverSacks_2009@872.75:876.46 CELLS YOU MAY HAVE ASTON MARTIN CELLS
OliverSacks_2009@878.95:881.78 I SAW AN ASTON MARTIN THIS MORNING I HAD TO BRING IT
OliverSacks_2009@883.24:886.26 AND NOW IT'S IN THERE SOMEWHERE
OliverSacks_2009@888.82:900.39 NOW AT THIS LEVEL IN WHAT'S CALLED THE INFEROTEMPORAL CORTEX THERE ARE ONLY VISUAL IMAGES OR FIGMENTS OR FRAGMENTS IT'S ONLY AT HIGHER LEVELS
OliverSacks_2009@901.53:913.08 THAT THE OTHER SENSES JOIN IN AND THERE ARE CONNECTIONS WITH MEMORY AND EMOTION AND IN THE CHARLES BONNET SYNDROME YOU DON'T GO TO THOSE HIGHER LEVELS YOU'RE IN THESE LEVELS OF INFERIOR VISUAL CORTEX
OliverSacks_2009@913.40:924.21 WHERE YOU HAVE THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS AND MILLIONS OF IMAGES OR FIGMENTS OR FRAGMENTARY FIGMENTS ALL NEURALLY ENCODED IN PARTICULAR CELLS
OliverSacks_2009@924.42:933.62 OR SMALL CLUSTERS OF CELLS NORMALLY THESE ARE ALL PART OF THE INTEGRATED STREAM OF PERCEPTION OR IMAGINATION
OliverSacks_2009@934.16:947.40 AND ONE IS NOT CONSCIOUS OF THEM IT IS ONLY IF ONE IS VISUALLY IMPAIRED OR BLIND THAT THE PROCESS IS INTERRUPTED AND INSTEAD OF GETTING NORMAL PERCEPTION YOU'RE GETTING AN ANARCHIC
OliverSacks_2009@958.78:967.82 AND SUDDENLY THAT THE MIND DOES ITS BEST TO ORGANIZE AND TO GIVE SOME SORT OF COHERENCE TO THIS BUT
OliverSacks_2009@968.15:979.10 WHEN THESE WERE FIRST DESCRIBED IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD BE INTERPRETED LIKE DREAMS BUT IN FACT PEOPLE SAY I DON'T RECOGNIZE THE PEOPLE I CAN'T FORM ANY ASSOCIATIONS
OliverSacks_2009@979.78:986.01 KERMIT MEANS NOTHING TO ME YOU DON'T GET ANYWHERE THINKING OF THEM AS DREAMS
OliverSacks_2009@987.40:996.03 WELL I'VE MORE OR LESS SAID WHAT I WANTED I THINK I JUST WANT TO RECAPITULATE AND SAY THIS IS COMMON
OliverSacks_2009@996.61:1008.12 THINK OF THE NUMBER OF BLIND PEOPLE THERE MUST BE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BLIND PEOPLE WHO HAVE THESE HALLUCINATIONS BUT ARE TOO SCARED TO MENTION THEM SO THIS SORT OF THING NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT INTO
OliverSacks_2009@1009.68:1022.20 NOTICE FOR PATIENTS FOR DOCTORS FOR THE PUBLIC FINALLY I THINK THEY ARE INFINITELY INTERESTING AND VALUABLE FOR GIVING ONE SOME INSIGHT AS TO HOW THE BRAIN WORKS
OliverSacks_2009@1022.82:1031.84 CHARLES BONNET SAID TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO HE WONDERED HOW THINKING THESE HALLUCINATIONS HOW AS HE PUT IT THE THEATER OF THE MIND
OliverSacks_2009@1032.31:1042.84 COULD BE GENERATED BY THE MACHINERY OF THE BRAIN NOW TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS LATER I THINK WE'RE BEGINNING TO GLIMPSE HOW THIS IS DONE THANKS VERY MUCH
OliverSacks_2009@1049.97:1052.56 ABOUT THESE THINGS WITH SO MUCH INSIGHT AND
OliverSacks_2009@1059.19:1059.82 I WAS AFRAID
OliverSacks_2009@1064.43:1076.52 A LOT OF THEM AND ACTUALLY I'M A LITTLE VISUALLY IMPAIRED MYSELF I'M BLIND IN ONE EYE AND NOT TERRIBLY GOOD IN THE OTHER AND I SEE THE GEOMETRICAL HALLUCINATIONS BUT THEY STOP THERE
OliverSacks_2009@1077.22:1080.49 AND THEY DON'T DISTURB YOU BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S DOING IT
OliverSacks_2009@1081.30:1091.57 YOU WORRIED O S WELL THEY DON'T DISTURB ME ANY MORE THAN MY TINNITUS WHICH I IGNORE THEY OCCASIONALLY INTEREST ME AND I HAVE MANY PICTURES OF THEM
OliverSacks_2009@1091.94:1100.08 IN MY NOTEBOOKS I'VE GONE AND HAD AN FMRI MYSELF TO SEE HOW MY VISUAL CORTEX IS TAKING OVER AND
OliverSacks_2009@1101.32:1114.08 WHEN I SEE ALL THESE HEXAGONS AND COMPLEX THINGS WHICH I ALSO HAVE IN VISUAL MIGRAINE I WONDER WHETHER EVERYONE SEES THINGS LIKE THIS AND WHETHER THINGS LIKE CAVE ART OR ORNAMENTAL ART MAY HAVE BEEN DERIVED FROM
