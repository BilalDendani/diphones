MinaBissell_2012G I 'M AFRAID I USED TO BE THE CAT
MinaBissell_2012G SO HAVE A GUESS OF HOW MANY CELLS HE HAS IN HIS BODY
MinaBissell_2012G AND SO THE QUESTION I RAISED BEFORE BECOMES EVEN MORE INTERESTING IF YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THE ENORMITY OF THIS IN EVERY ONE OF YOUR BODIES
MinaBissell_2012G SO
MinaBissell_2012G SO FOR VARIOUS REASONS WE TOOK THIS ONCOGENE ATTACHED IT TO A BLUE MARKER AND WE INJECTED IT INTO THE EMBRYOS NOW LOOK AT THAT
MinaBissell_2012G SO WE TOOK THE RED CELLS YOU SEE THE RED CELLS ARE SURROUNDED BY BLUE OTHER CELLS THAT SQUEEZE THEM AND BEHIND IT IS MATERIAL THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WAS MAINLY INERT AND IT WAS JUST HAVING A STRUCTURE TO KEEP THE SHAPE
MinaBissell_2012G AND SO WE FIRST PHOTOGRAPHED IT WITH THE ELECTRON MICROSCOPE YEARS AND YEARS AGO
MinaBissell_2012G SO WHAT DOES THIS TELL YOU THIS TELLS YOU THAT HERE ALSO CONTEXT OVERRIDES IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS CELLS DO DIFFERENT THINGS BUT HOW DOES CONTEXT SIGNAL
MinaBissell_2012G SO EINSTEIN SAID THAT FOR AN IDEA
MinaBissell_2012G THAT DOES NOT FIRST SEEM INSANE THERE IS NO HOPE
MinaBissell_2012G SIGNALS AND ACTUALLY TELLS THE CELLS WHAT TO DO
MinaBissell_2012G AND ON THE LEFT IS THE SINGLE NORMAL CELL HUMAN BREAST PUT IN THREE DIMENSIONAL GOOEY GEL THAT HAS EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX IT MAKES ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL STRUCTURES ON THE RIGHT YOU SEE IT LOOKS VERY UGLY THE CELLS CONTINUE TO GROW
MinaBissell_2012G AND THE MICROENVIRONMENT ALL RIGHT THUS FORM AND FUNCTION
MinaBissell_2012G BECAUSE ARROGANCE KILLS CURIOSITY CURIOSITY AND PASSION YOU NEED TO ALWAYS THINK WHAT ELSE NEEDS TO BE DISCOVERED AND MAYBE MY DISCOVERY NEEDS TO BE ADDED TO OR MAYBE IT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED SO WE HAVE NOW MADE AN AMAZING DISCOVERY A POST DOC IN THE LAB
