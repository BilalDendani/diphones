DorisKimSung_2012X I BASICALLY HAD TO ROLL DOWN THE WINDOW IT WAS USUALLY TOO HOT TOO STUFFY OR JUST TOO SMELLY AND MY FATHER WOULD NOT LET US USE THE AIR CONDITIONER HE SAID THAT IT WOULD OVERHEAT THE ENGINE AND YOU MIGHT REMEMBER SOME OF YOU HOW THE CARS WERE BACK THEN AND IT WAS A COMMON PROBLEM OF OVERHEATING
DorisKimSung_2012X BUT IT WAS ALSO THE SIGNAL THAT CAPPED THE USE OR OVERUSE OF ENERGY CONSUMING DEVICES
DorisKimSung_2012X THINGS HAVE CHANGED NOW WE HAVE CARS THAT WE TAKE ACROSS COUNTRY WE BLAST THE AIR CONDITIONING THE ENTIRE WAY AND WE NEVER EXPERIENCE OVERHEATING SO THERE 'S NO MORE SIGNAL FOR US TO TELL US TO STOP GREAT RIGHT
DorisKimSung_2012X WELL WE HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS IN BUILDINGS
DorisKimSung_2012X IN THE PAST BEFORE AIR CONDITIONING WE HAD THICK WALLS
DorisKimSung_2012X ON MECHANICAL AIR CONDITIONING TO COOL OUR SOLAR HEATED SPACES
DorisKimSung_2012X OVER TIME THE BUILDINGS GOT TALLER AND BIGGER OUR ENGINEERING EVEN BETTER SO THAT THE MECHANICAL SYSTEMS WERE MASSIVE
DorisKimSung_2012X THEY REQUIRE A HUGE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THEY GIVE OFF A LOT OF HEAT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND FOR SOME OF YOU MAY UNDERSTAND THE HEAT ISLAND EFFECT IN CITIES WHERE THE URBAN AREAS ARE MUCH MORE WARM THAN THE ADJACENT RURAL AREAS
DorisKimSung_2012X BUT WE ALSO HAVE PROBLEMS THAT WHEN WE LOSE POWER WE CAN 'T OPEN A WINDOW HERE
DorisKimSung_2012X AND SO THE BUILDINGS ARE UNINHABITABLE AND HAVE TO BE MADE VACANT UNTIL THAT AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM CAN START UP AGAIN
DorisKimSung_2012X EVEN WORSE WITH OUR INTENTION OF TRYING TO MAKE BUILDINGS MOVE TOWARDS A NET ZERO ENERGY STATE
DorisKimSung_2012X IF WE LOOK AT BIOLOGY AND MANY OF YOU PROBABLY DON 'T KNOW I WAS A BIOLOGY MAJOR BEFORE I WENT INTO ARCHITECTURE
DorisKimSung_2012X THE HUMAN SKIN IS THE ORGAN THAT NATURALLY REGULATES THE TEMPERATURE IN THE BODY
DorisKimSung_2012X AND IT 'S A FANTASTIC THING THAT 'S THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE FOR THE BODY IT HAS PORES IT HAS SWEAT GLANDS IT HAS ALL THESE THINGS THAT WORK TOGETHER VERY DYNAMICALLY AND VERY EFFICIENTLY AND SO WHAT I PROPOSE IS THAT OUR BUILDING SKINS SHOULD BE MORE SIMILAR TO
DorisKimSung_2012X HUMAN SKIN
DorisKimSung_2012X AND BY DOING SO CAN BE MUCH MORE DYNAMIC RESPONSIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED DEPENDING ON WHERE IT IS
DorisKimSung_2012X AND THIS GETS ME BACK TO MY RESEARCH WHAT I PROPOSED FIRST DOING IS LOOKING AT A DIFFERENT MATERIAL PALETTE TO DO THAT
DorisKimSung_2012X I PRESENTLY OR CURRENTLY WORK WITH SMART MATERIALS AND A SMART THERMO BIMETAL
DorisKimSung_2012X FIRST OF ALL I GUESS WE CALL IT SMART BECAUSE IT REQUIRES NO CONTROLS AND IT REQUIRES NO ENERGY AND THAT 'S A VERY BIG DEAL FOR ARCHITECTURE
DorisKimSung_2012X SO IN EARLY PROTOTYPES I BUILT THESE SURFACES TO TRY TO SEE HOW THE CURL WOULD REACT TO TEMPERATURE AND POSSIBLY ALLOW AIR TO VENTILATE THROUGH THE SYSTEM
DorisKimSung_2012X AND IN OTHER PROTOTYPES DID SURFACES WHERE THE MULTIPLICITY OF HAVING THESE STRIPS TOGETHER CAN TRY TO MAKE BIGGER MOVEMENT HAPPEN WHEN ALSO HEATED
DorisKimSung_2012X AND ITS INTENTION IS TO MAKE THIS CANOPY THAT DOES TWO THINGS ONE IT
DorisKimSung_2012X IT 'S A SUN SHADING DEVICE SO THAT WHEN THE SUN HITS THE SURFACE IT CONSTRICTS THE AMOUNT OF SUN PASSING THROUGH AND IN OTHER AREAS IT 'S A VENTILATING SYSTEM SO THAT HOT TRAPPED AIR UNDERNEATH CAN ACTUALLY MOVE THROUGH AND OUT WHEN NECESSARY
DorisKimSung_2012X YOU CAN SEE HERE IN THIS TIME LAPSE VIDEO THAT
DorisKimSung_2012X THE SUN AS IT MOVES ACROSS THE SURFACE AS WELL AS THE SHADE EACH OF THE TILES MOVES INDIVIDUALLY KEEP IN MIND WITH THE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE TODAY THIS THING WAS MADE OUT OF ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND PIECES AND THERE 'S NO TWO PIECES ALIKE AT ALL EVERY SINGLE ONE IS DIFFERENT
DorisKimSung_2012X AND THE GREAT THING WITH THAT IS THE FACT THAT WE CAN CALIBRATE EACH ONE TO BE VERY VERY SPECIFIC TO ITS LOCATION TO THE ANGLE OF THE SUN AND ALSO HOW THE THING ACTUALLY CURLS
DorisKimSung_2012X SO THIS KIND OF PROOF OF CONCEPT PROJECT HAS A LOT OF IMPLICATIONS TO ACTUAL FUTURE APPLICATION IN ARCHITECTURE AND IN THIS CASE HERE YOU SEE A HOUSE THAT 'S FOR A DEVELOPER IN CHINA AND IT 'S ACTUALLY A FOUR STORY GLASS BOX IT 'S STILL WITH THAT GLASS BOX BECAUSE WE STILL WANT THAT VISUAL ACCESS
DorisKimSung_2012X BUT NOW IT 'S SHEATHED WITH THIS THERMO BIMETAL LAYER IT 'S A SCREEN THAT GOES AROUND IT AND THAT LAYER CAN ACTUALLY OPEN AND CLOSE AS THAT SUN MOVES AROUND ON THAT SURFACE
DorisKimSung_2012X I 'M ALSO LOOKING AT TRYING TO DEVELOP SOME BUILDING COMPONENTS FOR THE MARKET AND SO HERE YOU SEE A PRETTY TYPICAL
DorisKimSung_2012X DOUBLE GLAZED WINDOW
DorisKimSung_2012X PANEL AND IN THAT PANEL BETWEEN THOSE TWO PIECES OF GLASS THAT DOUBLE GLAZING
DorisKimSung_2012X I 'M TRYING TO WORK ON MAKING A THERMO BIMETAL PATTERN SYSTEM SO THAT WHEN THE SUN HITS THAT OUTSIDE LAYER AND HEATS THAT INTERIOR CAVITY THAT THERMO BIMETAL WILL BEGIN TO CURL AND WHAT ACTUALLY WILL HAPPEN THEN IS IT 'LL START TO BLOCK OUT THE SUN IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE BUILDING
DorisKimSung_2012X AND TOTALLY IF NECESSARY
DorisKimSung_2012X AND SO YOU CAN IMAGINE EVEN IN THIS APPLICATION THAT IN A HIGH RISE BUILDING WHERE THE PANEL SYSTEMS GO FROM FLOOR TO FLOOR UP TO THIRTY FORTY FLOORS THE ENTIRE SURFACE COULD BE DIFFERENTIATED AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF DAY DEPENDING ON HOW THAT SUN MOVES ACROSS AND HITS THAT SURFACE
DorisKimSung_2012X AND THESE ARE SOME LATER STUDIES THAT I 'M WORKING ON RIGHT NOW THAT ARE ON THE BOARDS WHERE YOU CAN SEE IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER WITH THE RED IT 'S ACTUALLY SMALLER PIECES OF THERMOMETAL AND IT 'S ACTUALLY GOING TO WE 'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT MOVE LIKE CILIA OR EYELASHES
DorisKimSung_2012X AND THEY BRING THE AIR THROUGH AND IT MOVES THROUGH THEIR SYSTEM TO COOL THEM DOWN AND SO IN THIS PROJECT I 'M TRYING TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN CONSIDER THAT IN ARCHITECTURE TOO HOW WE CAN BRING AIR THROUGH HOLES IN THE SIDES OF A BUILDING
DorisKimSung_2012X AND SO YOU SEE HERE SOME EARLY STUDIES OF BLOCKS WHERE THOSE HOLES ARE ACTUALLY COMING THROUGH AND THIS IS BEFORE THE THERMO BIMETAL IS APPLIED
DorisKimSung_2012X AND THIS IS AFTER THE BIMETAL IS APPLIED SORRY IT 'S A LITTLE HARD TO SEE BUT ON THE SURFACES YOU CAN SEE THESE RED ARROWS ON THE LEFT IT 'S WHEN IT 'S COLD AND THE THERMO BIMETAL IS FLAT SO IT WILL CONSTRICT AIR FROM PASSING THROUGH THE BLOCKS AND ON THE RIGHT THE THERMO BIMETAL CURLS AND ALLOWS THAT AIR TO PASS THROUGH SO
DorisKimSung_2012X THE WALLS INSTEAD OF OPENING WINDOWS
DorisKimSung_2012X SO I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH ONE LAST IMPRESSION ABOUT THE PROJECT OR THIS KIND OF WORK AND USING SMART MATERIALS
DorisKimSung_2012X WHEN YOU 'RE TIRED OF OPENING AND CLOSING THOSE BLINDS DAY AFTER DAY WHEN YOU 'RE ON VACATION AND THERE 'S NO ONE THERE ON THE WEEKENDS TO BE TURNING OFF AND ON THE CONTROLS
DorisKimSung_2012X WORKING TIRELESSLY EFFICIENTLY AND ENDLESSLY
DorisKimSung_2012X THANK YOU
