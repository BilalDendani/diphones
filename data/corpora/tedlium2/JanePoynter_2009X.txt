JanePoynter_2009X@18.34:25.58 OF LIVING INSIDE TWO BIOSPHERES OF COURSE WE ALL HERE IN THIS ROOM LIVE IN BIOSPHERE ONE
JanePoynter_2009X@35.99:41.02 SO WHAT DID I LEARN WELL HERE I AM INSIDE BIOSPHERE TWO MAKING A PIZZA
JanePoynter_2009X@41.02:58.87 SO I AM HARVESTING THE WHEAT IN ORDER TO MAKE THE DOUGH AND THEN OF COURSE I HAVE TO MILK THE GOATS AND FEED THE GOATS IN ORDER TO MAKE THE CHEESE IT TOOK ME FOUR MONTHS IN BIOSPHERE TWO TO MAKE A PIZZA HERE IN BIOSPHERE ONE WELL IT TAKES ME ABOUT TWO MINUTES BECAUSE I PICK UP THE PHONE AND I CALL AND SAY HEY CAN YOU DELIVER THE PIZZA
JanePoynter_2009X@58.87:60.81 SO BIOSPHERE TWO
JanePoynter_2009X@60.89:68.87 WAS ESSENTIALLY A THREE ACRE ENTIRELY SEALED MINIATURE WORLD THAT I LIVED IN FOR TWO YEARS AND TWENTY MINUTES
JanePoynter_2009X@77.89:82.77 SO WE HAD OUR OWN MINIATURE RAINFOREST A PRIVATE BEACH WITH A CORAL REEF WE HAD
JanePoynter_2009X@90.83:106.53 BACK IN THE MID EIGHTY S WHEN WE WERE DESIGNING BIOSPHERE TWO WE HAD TO ASK OURSELVES SOME PRETTY BASIC QUESTIONS I MEAN WHAT IS A BIOSPHERE BACK THEN YES I GUESS WE ALL KNOW NOW THAT IT IS ESSENTIALLY THE SPHERE OF LIFE AROUND THE EARTH RIGHT WELL YOU HAVE TO GET A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC THAN THAT IF YOU 'RE GOING TO BUILD ONE
JanePoynter_2009X@106.53:115.69 AND SO WE DECIDED THAT WHAT IT REALLY IS IS THAT IT IS ENTIRELY MATERIALLY CLOSED THAT IS NOTHING GOES IN OR OUT AT ALL NO MATERIAL
JanePoynter_2009X@115.69:119.55 AND ENERGETICALLY OPEN WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT PLANET EARTH IS
JanePoynter_2009X@132.54:142.04 THE DOCTORS WERE INCREDIBLY CONCERNED THAT HE WAS GOING TO SUCCUMB TO SOME DREADFUL TOXIN OR THAT HIS LUNGS WERE GOING TO GET CHOKED WITH BACTERIA OR SOMETHING FUNGUS BUT OF COURSE NONE OF THAT HAPPENED
JanePoynter_2009X@142.58:157.31 AND OVER THE ENSUING FEW YEARS THERE WERE GREAT SAGAS ABOUT DESIGNING BIOSPHERE TWO BUT BY ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE WE FINALLY HAD THIS THING BUILT AND IT WAS TIME FOR US TO GO IN AND GIVE IT A GO WE NEEDED TO KNOW
JanePoynter_2009X@167.05:168.62 BIG QUESTIONS
JanePoynter_2009X@168.9:178.17 AND WE WANTED TO KNOW THIS BOTH FOR BEING ABLE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE UNIVERSE IF WE WERE GOING TO GO TO MARS FOR INSTANCE WOULD WE TAKE A BIOSPHERE WITH US TO LIVE IN IT WE ALSO WANTED TO KNOW
JanePoynter_2009X@221.27:228.48 ONE OF THE BIOSPHERIANS CALLED IT GARDEN OF EDEN ON TOP OF AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER AND THEN ALSO WE HAD THE HUMAN HABITAT OF COURSE WITH THE LABORATORIES AND ALL OF THAT
JanePoynter_2009X@228.48:234.76 THIS IS THE AGRICULTURE IT WAS ESSENTIALLY AN ORGANIC FARM
JanePoynter_2009X@245.33:261.32 AT THAT MOMENT I BECAME PART OF THAT BIOSPHERE AND I DON 'T MEAN THAT IN AN ABSTRACT SENSE I MEAN IT RATHER LITERALLY WHEN I BREATHED OUT MY CO TWO FED THE SWEET POTATOES THAT I WAS GROWING
JanePoynter_2009X@261.37:265.27 AND WE ATE AN AWFUL LOT OF THE SWEET POTATOES
JanePoynter_2009X@281.83:290.71 WHEN IT CAME TO OUR ATMOSPHERE HOWEVER IT WASN 'T THAT MUCH OF A JOKE OVER THE LONG TERM BECAUSE IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE LOSING OXYGEN
JanePoynter_2009X@290.98:307.51 QUITE A LOT OF OXYGEN AND WE KNEW THAT WE WERE LOSING CO TWO AND SO WE WERE WORKING TO SEQUESTER CARBON GOOD LORD WE KNOW THAT TERM NOW WE WERE GROWING PLANTS LIKE CRAZY WE WERE TAKING THEIR BIOMASS STORING THEM IN THE BASEMENT GROWING PLANTS GOING AROUND AROUND AROUND TRYING TO TAKE ALL OF THAT CARBON OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE
JanePoynter_2009X@307.51:316.57 WE WERE TRYING TO STOP CARBON FROM GOING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE WE STOPPED IRRIGATING OUR SOIL AS MUCH AS WE COULD WE STOPPED TILLING SO THAT WE COULD PREVENT GREENHOUSE GASSES FROM GOING INTO THE AIR
JanePoynter_2009X@331.47:341.95 AND I TELL YOU WHEN YOU LOSE A LOT OF OXYGEN AND OUR OXYGEN WENT DOWN QUITE FAR IT WENT FROM TWENTY ONE PERCENT DOWN TO FOURTEEN POINT TWO PERCENT MY GOODNESS DO YOU FEEL DREADFUL
JanePoynter_2009X@341.95:350 I MEAN WE WERE DRAGGING OURSELVES AROUND THE BIOSPHERE AND WE HAD SLEEP APNEA AT NIGHT SO YOU 'D WAKE UP GASPING WITH BREATH
JanePoynter_2009X@430.27:435.22 AT THE END OF THE TWO YEARS WHEN WE CAME OUT WE WERE ELATED BECAUSE IN FACT
JanePoynter_2009X@455.41:458.88 PEOPLE ON THE OTHER HAND WAS A DIFFERENT SUBJECT WE WERE
JanePoynter_2009X@477.58:481.5 PEOPLE STINK WE STINK OF
JanePoynter_2009X@502.3:518 I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS IN MY FOOD WHERE IT CAME FROM I DIDN 'T EVEN RECOGNIZE HALF THE NAMES IN MOST OF THE FOOD THAT I WAS EATING IN FACT I WOULD STAND FOR HOURS IN THE AISLES OF SHOPS READING ALL THE NAMES ON ALL OF THE THINGS PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT I WAS NUTS IT WAS REALLY QUITE
JanePoynter_2009X@524.15:541.61 OF WHERE I WAS IN THIS BIG BIOSPHERE IN THIS BIG BIOSPHERE THAT WE ALL LIVE IN IN BIOSPHERE TWO I TOTALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT I HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON MY BIOSPHERE EVERYDAY AND IT HAD AN IMPACT ON ME VERY VISCERALLY VERY LITERALLY SO I WENT ABOUT MY BUSINESS
JanePoynter_2009X@546.76:563.57 AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID WAS TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW SMALL CAN YOU MAKE THESE BIOSPHERES AND WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THEM AND SO WE SENT ONE ONTO THE MIR SPACE STATION WE HAD ONE ON THE SHUTTLE AND ONE ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION FOR SIXTEEN MONTHS WHERE WE MANAGED TO PRODUCE THE FIRST ORGANISMS TO GO THROUGH
JanePoynter_2009X@563.57:571.9 COMPLETE MULTIPLE LIFE CYCLES IN SPACE REALLY PUSHING THE ENVELOPE OF UNDERSTANDING HOW MALLEABLE OUR LIFE SYSTEMS ARE
JanePoynter_2009X@571.9:590.8 AND I 'M ALSO PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT YOU 'RE GETTING A SNEAK PREVIEW ON FRIDAY WE 'RE GOING TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE 'RE ACTUALLY FORMING A TEAM TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM TO GROW PLANTS ON THE MOON WHICH IS GOING TO BE PRETTY FUN AND THE LEGACY OF THAT IS A SYSTEM THAT WE WERE DESIGNING AN ENTIRELY SEALED SYSTEM TO GROW PLANTS TO GROW ON MARS
JanePoynter_2009X@590.96:604.74 AND PART OF THAT IS THAT WE HAD TO MODEL VERY RAPID CIRCULATION OF CO TWO AND OXYGEN AND WATER THROUGH THIS PLANT SYSTEM AS A RESULT OF THAT MODELING I ENDED UP IN ALL PLACES
JanePoynter_2009X@606.96:625.11 ERITREA FORMERLY PART OF ETHIOPIA IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES THAT IS ASTONISHINGLY BEAUTIFUL INCREDIBLY STARK AND I HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OF HOW PEOPLE EKE OUT A LIVING THERE IT IS SO DRY THIS IS WHAT I SAW
JanePoynter_2009X@625.18:636.38 BUT THIS IS ALSO WHAT I SAW I SAW A COMPANY THAT HAD TAKEN SEAWATER AND SAND AND THEY WERE GROWING
JanePoynter_2009X@644.03:649.24 IT WAS ASTONISHING THEY WERE ALSO PRODUCING MANGROVES IN A PLANTATION
JanePoynter_2009X@649.24:653.62 AND THE MANGROVES WERE PROVIDING WOOD AND HONEY AND LEAVES FOR THE ANIMALS
JanePoynter_2009X@653.62:661.27 SO THAT THEY COULD PRODUCE MILK AND WHATNOT LIKE WE HAD IN THE BIOSPHERE AND ALL OF IT WAS COMING FROM THIS SHRIMP FARMS
JanePoynter_2009X@686.47:698.55 THEY HAD CREATED AN INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM OF A SENSE I WAS THERE BECAUSE I WAS ACTUALLY MODELING THE MANGROVE PORTION FOR A CARBON CREDIT PROGRAM UNDER THE U N KYOTO PROTOCOL SYSTEM
JanePoynter_2009X@714.65:723.64 AND UNDERSTAND ITS INTERACTIONS WITH THE ENTIRE EARTH AND PUT YOUR PROJECT IN THAT CONTEXT AROUND THE
JanePoynter_2009X@754.55:767.58 WE 'RE IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMING FROM THIS TO WHAT I WOULD CALL A BIOPHILIC SOCIETY ONE WHERE WE LEARN TO NURTURE SOCIETY NOW IT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE IT
JanePoynter_2009X@778.9:783.19 AND I THINK OFTEN TIMES PEOPLE GET LOST IN THAT THEY GO BUT HOW
JanePoynter_2009X@796.03:811.93 THIS WAS MY BACKYARD VERY EARLY ON WHEN I BOUGHT MY PROPERTY AND IN ARIZONA OF COURSE EVERYBODY PUTS GRAVEL DOWN AND THEY LIKE TO KEEP EVERYTHING BEAUTIFULLY RAKED AND THEY KEEP ALL THE LEAVES AWAY AND ON SUNDAY MORNING THE NEIGHBORS LEAF BLOWER COMES OUT AND I WANT TO THROTTLE THEM
JanePoynter_2009X@818.12:822.76 AND I THREW AWAY MY RAKE AND
JanePoynter_2009X@822.76:833.81 ALL OF THE LEAVES FALL FROM THE TREES THAT I HAVE ON MY PROPERTY AND OVER TIME ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAVE I BEEN DOING I 'VE BEEN BUILDING TOPSOIL AND SO NOW ALL THE BIRDS COME IN AND I HAVE HAWKS AND I HAVE
JanePoynter_2009X@833.81:836.83 AN OASIS
JanePoynter_2009X@836.83:854 THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS EVERY SPRING FOR SIX WEEKS SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS I HAVE THIS FLUSH OF GREEN OASIS THIS IS ACTUALLY IN A RIPARIAN AREA AND ALL OF TUCSON COULD BE LIKE THIS IF EVERYBODY WOULD JUST REVOLT AND THROW AWAY THE RAKE THE SMALL STUFF COUNTS
JanePoynter_2009X@854:861.54 THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND PROMETHEUS HAS GIVEN US THIS THE ABILITY TO LIGHT UP THE WORLD
JanePoynter_2009X@861.68:874.99 IT HAS ALSO GIVEN US THIS THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THE WORLD FROM THE OUTSIDE NOW WE MAY NOT ALL HAVE ANOTHER BIOSPHERE THAT WE CAN RUN TO AND COMPARE IT TO THIS BIOSPHERE
JanePoynter_2009X@874.99:885.04 BUT WE CAN LOOK AT THE WORLD AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE ARE IN ITS CONTEXT AND HOW WE CHOOSE TO INTERACT
JanePoynter_2009X@894.77:898.59 TO YOU TAKE A DEEP BREATH
JanePoynter_2009X@898.98:901.23 THE YOGIS HAD IT RIGHT
JanePoynter_2009X@908.52:912.67 AND AS YOU BREATHE THINK ABOUT WHAT IS IN YOUR BREATH
JanePoynter_2009X@914.29:918.6 THERE PERHAPS IS THE CO TWO FROM THE PERSON SITTING NEXT DOOR TO YOU
JanePoynter_2009X@919.14:924.9 MAYBE THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF OXYGEN FROM SOME ALGAE ON THE BEACH NOT FAR FROM HERE
JanePoynter_2009X@925.97:928.17 IT ALSO CONNECTS US IN TIME
JanePoynter_2009X@928.34:935.01 THERE MAY BE SOME CARBON IN YOUR BREATH FROM THE DINOSAURS
