GarrettLisi_2008 THOSE KILLER EQUATIONS SWEET
GarrettLisi_2008 THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MINUTES I'M GOING TO DO THE BEST I CAN TO DESCRIBE THE BEAUTY OF PARTICLE PHYSICS WITHOUT EQUATIONS
GarrettLisi_2008 IT TURNS OUT THERE'S A LOT WE CAN LEARN FROM
GarrettLisi_2008 CORAL IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL AND UNUSUAL ANIMAL EACH CORAL HEAD CONSISTS OF THOUSAND OF INDIVIDUAL POLYPS
GarrettLisi_2008 THESE POLYPS ARE CONTINUALLY BUDDING AND BRANCHING INTO GENETICALLY IDENTICAL NEIGHBORS
GarrettLisi_2008 IF WE IMAGINE THIS TO BE A HYPER INTELLIGENT CORAL
GarrettLisi_2008 WE CAN SINGLE OUT AN INDIVIDUAL AND ASK HIM A REASONABLE QUESTION WE CAN ASK HOW EXACTLY HE GOT TO BE IN THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION COMPARED TO HIS NEIGHBORS
GarrettLisi_2008 IT WAS JUST CHANCE OR DESTINY OR WHAT
GarrettLisi_2008 NOW AFTER ADMONISHING US FOR TURNING THE TEMPERATURE UP TOO HIGH
GarrettLisi_2008 HE WOULD TELL US THAT OUR QUESTION WAS COMPLETELY STUPID
GarrettLisi_2008 FOR A CORAL BRANCHING INTO DIFFERENT COPIES IS THE MOST NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD
GarrettLisi_2008 UNLIKE US A HYPER INTELLIGENT CORAL WOULD BE UNIQUELY PREPARED TO UNDERSTAND QUANTUM MECHANICS
GarrettLisi_2008 THESE REALITIES ARE EXPERIENCED SEPARATELY BY EACH INDIVIDUAL AS FAR AS EITHER CAN TELL THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T EXIST
GarrettLisi_2008 THE REST OF PHYSICS IS ABOUT DESCRIBING WHAT CAN HAPPEN AND WHAT CAN
GarrettLisi_2008 AND THINGS CAN HAPPEN ONLY IF THESE INTERACTIONS ARE PERFECTLY BALANCED
GarrettLisi_2008 NOW I'LL GO AHEAD AND DESCRIBE HOW WE KNOW ABOUT THESE PARTICLES WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW THIS BALANCE WORKS
GarrettLisi_2008 IN THIS MACHINE A BEAM OF PROTONS AND ANTI PROTONS ARE ACCELERATED TO NEAR THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND BROUGHT TOGETHER IN A COLLISION PRODUCING A BURST OF PURE ENERGY
GarrettLisi_2008 WE CAN'T PREDICT SPECIFICALLY WHAT PARTICLES WILL BE PRODUCED IN ANY INDIVIDUAL COLLISION QUANTUM MECHANICS TELLS US ALL POSSIBILITIES ARE REALIZED
GarrettLisi_2008 ANY PARTICLES MORE MASSIVE THAN THIS ENERGY LIMIT AREN'T PRODUCED AND REMAIN INVISIBLE TO US
GarrettLisi_2008 THIS IS WHY THIS NEW PARTICLE ACCELERATOR IS SO EXCITING IT'S GOING TO PUSH THIS ENERGY LIMIT SEVEN TIMES BEYOND WHAT'S EVER BEEN DONE BEFORE SO WE'RE GOING TO GET TO SEE SOME NEW PARTICLES VERY SOON
GarrettLisi_2008 THERE'S A WHOLE ZOO OF SUBATOMIC PARTICLES MOST OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH ELECTRONS A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM MAKE A GOOD LIVING PUSHING THEM AROUND
GarrettLisi_2008 IN CONTRAST THE UP AND DOWN QUARKS HAVE VERY LARGE MASSES AND COMBINE IN THREES TO MAKE THE PROTONS AND NEUTRONS INSIDE ATOMS
GarrettLisi_2008 ALL OF THESE MATTER PARTICLES COME IN LEFT AND RIGHT HANDED VARIETIES AND HAVE ANTI PARTICLE PARTNERS THAT CARRY OPPOSITE CHARGES
GarrettLisi_2008 THESE FAMILIAR PARTICLES ALSO HAVE LESS FAMILIAR SECOND AND THIRD GENERATIONS WHICH HAVE THE SAME CHARGES AS THE FIRST BUT HAVE MUCH HIGHER MASSES
GarrettLisi_2008 THE STRONG FORCE ACTS BETWEEN QUARKS WHICH CARRY A DIFFERENT KIND OF CHARGE CALLED COLOR CHARGE
GarrettLisi_2008 FINALLY THERE'S THE FORCE OF GRAVITY WHICH INTERACTS WITH MATTER VIA ITS MASS
GarrettLisi_2008 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND HERE IS THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF CHARGE ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE FORCES THESE FOUR DIFFERENT FORCES INTERACT WITH MATTER ACCORDING TO THE CORRESPONDING CHARGES THAT EACH PARTICLE HAS
GarrettLisi_2008 A PARTICLE THAT HASN'T BEEN SEEN YET BUT WE'RE PRETTY SURE EXISTS IS THE HIGGS PARTICLE WHICH GIVES MASSES TO ALL THESE OTHER PARTICLES THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER IS TO SEE THIS HIGGS PARTICLE AND WE'RE ALMOST CERTAIN IT WILL
GarrettLisi_2008 TO SHOW YOU ONE BEAUTIFUL POSSIBILITY TOWARDS THE END OF THIS TALK
GarrettLisi_2008 IF WE COUNT UP ALL THESE DIFFERENT PARTICLES USING THEIR VARIOUS SPINS AND CHARGES THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX
GarrettLisi_2008 BUT IF WE PLOT THEM OUT ACCORDING TO THEIR CHARGES SOME BEAUTIFUL PATTERNS EMERGE
GarrettLisi_2008 MOST FAMILIAR CHARGE IS ELECTRIC CHARGE
GarrettLisi_2008 NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT ELECTRIC CHARGES ACTUALLY HAVE A COMBINATION OF TWO OTHER CHARGES HYPER CHARGE AND WEAK CHARGE
GarrettLisi_2008 IF WE SPREAD OUT THE HYPER CHARGE AND WEAK CHARGE
GarrettLisi_2008 THE REASON MOST OF US ARE ONLY FAMILIAR WITH ELECTRIC CHARGE AND NOT BOTH OF THESE IS BECAUSE OF THE HIGGS PARTICLE
GarrettLisi_2008 THE HIGGS OVER HERE ON THE LEFT HAS A LARGE MASS AND BREAKS THE SYMMETRY OF THIS ELECTROWEAK PATTERN
GarrettLisi_2008 IT MAKES THE WEAK FORCE VERY WEAK BY GIVING THE WEAK PARTICLES A LARGE MASS SINCE THIS MASSIVE HIGGS SITS ALONG THE HORIZONTAL DIRECTION IN THIS DIAGRAM THE PHOTONS OF ELECTROMAGNETISM REMAIN MASSLESS AND INTERACT WITH ELECTRIC CHARGE ALONG THE VERTICAL DIRECTION IN THIS CHARGE SPACE
GarrettLisi_2008 SO THE ELECTROMAGNETIC AND WEAK FORCES ARE DESCRIBED BY THIS PATTERN OF PARTICLE CHARGES IN TWO DIMENSIONAL SPACE
GarrettLisi_2008 AND PLOTTING THE CHARGES OF THE FORCE PARTICLES IN QUARKS ALONG
GarrettLisi_2008 THE CHARGES OF ALL KNOWN PARTICLES CAN BE PLOTTED IN A FOUR DIMENSIONAL CHARGE SPACE AND PROJECTED DOWN TO TWO DIMENSIONS LIKE THIS SO WE CAN SEE THEM WHENEVER PARTICLES INTERACT
GarrettLisi_2008 NATURE KEEPS THINGS IN A PERFECT BALANCE ALONG ALL FOUR OF THESE CHARGE DIRECTIONS
GarrettLisi_2008 THESE THREE STILL ADD TO ZERO TOTAL CHARGE NATURE ALWAYS KEEPS A PERFECT BALANCE
GarrettLisi_2008 THESE PATTERNS OF CHARGES ARE NOT JUST PRETTY
GarrettLisi_2008 THEY TELL US WHAT INTERACTIONS ARE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN AND WE CAN ROTATE THIS CHARGE SPACE IN FOUR DIMENSIONS TO GET A BETTER LOOK AT THE STRONG INTERACTION
GarrettLisi_2008 TO GIVE A QUARK WITH A DIFFERENT COLOR CHARGE THIS RED
GarrettLisi_2008 AND STRONG INTERACTIONS ARE HAPPENING MILLIONS OF TIMES EACH SECOND IN EVERY ATOM OF OUR BODIES HOLDING THE ATOMIC NUCLEI TOGETHER
GarrettLisi_2008 AND SEE THAT IT'S QUITE PRETTY
GarrettLisi_2008 RIGHT NOW THIS PATTERN MATCHES OUR BEST CURRENT KNOWLEDGE OF HOW NATURE IS BUILT AT THE TINY SCALES OF THESE ELEMENTARY PARTICLES
GarrettLisi_2008 WE ALREADY KNOW THE PARTICLE PHYSICS OF THESE TINY SCALES THE WAY THE UNIVERSE WORKS WITH THESE TINY SCALES
GarrettLisi_2008 SO THERE'S AN OLD IDEA IN PARTICLE PHYSICS THAT THIS KNOWN PATTERN OF CHARGES
GarrettLisi_2008 WE NEED TO INTRODUCE NEW FORCES WITH NEW CHARGE DIRECTIONS
GarrettLisi_2008 WHEN WE INTRODUCE A NEW DIRECTION WE GET TO GUESS WHAT CHARGES THE PARTICLES HAVE ALONG THIS DIRECTION AND THEN WE CAN ROTATE IT IN WITH THE OTHERS
GarrettLisi_2008 WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS NEW UNIFIED PATTERN WE CAN SEE A COUPLE OF GAPS WHERE PARTICLES SEEM TO BE MISSING
GarrettLisi_2008 THIS IS THE WAY THEORIES OF UNIFICATION WORK
GarrettLisi_2008 A PHYSICIST LOOKS FOR LARGER MORE SYMMETRIC PATTERNS THAT INCLUDE THE ESTABLISHED PATTERN AS A SUBSET
GarrettLisi_2008 THE LARGER PATTERN ALLOWS US TO PREDICT THE EXISTENCE OF PARTICLES THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN SEEN
GarrettLisi_2008 THIS UNIFICATION MODEL PREDICTS THE EXISTENCE OF THESE TWO NEW FORCE PARTICLES WHICH SHOULD ACT A LOT LIKE THE WEAK FORCE ONLY WEAKER
GarrettLisi_2008 WE CAN ROTATE THIS SET OF CHARGES IN SEVEN DIMENSIONS AND CONSIDER AN ODD FACT ABOUT THE MATTER PARTICLES
GarrettLisi_2008 THE SECOND AND THIRD GENERATIONS OF MATTER HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME CHARGES IN SIX DIMENSIONAL CHARGE SPACE AS THE FIRST GENERATION
GarrettLisi_2008 HOWEVER IF WE WORK IN EIGHT DIMENSIONAL CHARGE SPACE THEN WE CAN ASSIGN UNIQUE NEW CHARGES TO EACH PARTICLE
GarrettLisi_2008 THIS PARTICULAR PATTERN OF CHARGES IN EIGHT DIMENSIONS
GarrettLisi_2008 PATTERN OF THE LARGEST EXCEPTIONAL LIE GROUP
GarrettLisi_2008 ONE SMALL PART OF THIS E EIGHT SHAPE CAN BE USED TO DESCRIBE THE CURVED SPACE TIME OF EINSTEIN 'S GENERAL RELATIVITY EXPLAINING GRAVITY
GarrettLisi_2008 THE PATTERN OF THIS SHAPE
GarrettLisi_2008 LIVING IN EIGHT DIMENSIONAL CHARGE SPACE
GarrettLisi_2008 WITH A PARTICULAR ROTATION WE CAN LOOK DOWN THROUGH THIS PATTERN IN EIGHT DIMENSIONS ALONG A SYMMETRY AXIS
GarrettLisi_2008 AND SEE ALL THE PARTICLES AT ONCE
GarrettLisi_2008 IT'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL OBJECT AND AS WITH ANY UNIFICATION
GarrettLisi_2008 WE CAN SEE SOME HOLES WHERE NEW PARTICLES ARE REQUIRED BY THIS PATTERN
GarrettLisi_2008 TWENTY GAPS WHERE NEW PARTICLES SHOULD BE TWO OF WHICH HAVE BEEN FILLED BY THE PATI AND SALAM PARTICLES FROM THEIR LOCATION IN THIS PATTERN
GarrettLisi_2008 WE KNOW THAT THESE NEW PARTICLES SHOULD BE SCALAR FIELDS LIKE THE HIGGS PARTICLE BUT HAVE COLOR CHARGE AND INTERACT WITH THE STRONG FORCE
GarrettLisi_2008 FILLING IN THESE NEW PARTICLES COMPLETES THIS PATTERN GIVING US THE FULL E EIGHT
GarrettLisi_2008 THIS E EIGHT PATTERN HAS VERY DEEP MATHEMATICAL ROOTS IT'S CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL STRUCTURE IN MATHEMATICS
GarrettLisi_2008 WHICH STANDS CONTINUALLY OPEN TO OUR GAZE IS WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF MATHEMATICS
GarrettLisi_2008 CHARACTERS ARE TRIANGLES CIRCLES AND OTHER GEOMETRICAL FIGURES WITHOUT WHICH IT IS HUMANLY IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND A SINGLE WORD
GarrettLisi_2008 I BELIEVE THIS TO BE TRUE AND I'VE TRIED TO FOLLOW GALILEO 'S GUIDANCE IN DESCRIBING THE MATHEMATICS OF PARTICLE PHYSICS USING ONLY TRIANGLES CIRCLES AND OTHER GEOMETRICAL FIGURES
GarrettLisi_2008 OF COURSE WHEN OTHER PHYSICISTS AND I ACTUALLY WORK ON THIS STUFF
GarrettLisi_2008 IT'S REASSURING THAT AT THE HEART OF THIS MATHEMATICS IS PURE
GarrettLisi_2008 WITH QUANTUM MECHANICS THIS MATHEMATICS DESCRIBES OUR UNIVERSE AS A GROWING E EIGHT CORAL WITH PARTICLES INTERACTING AT EVERY LOCATION IN ALL POSSIBLE WAYS ACCORDING TO A BEAUTIFUL PATTERN
GarrettLisi_2008 IF THE LHC FINDS PARTICLES THAT FIT THIS E EIGHT PATTERN THAT WILL BE VERY VERY COOL
GarrettLisi_2008 IF THE LHC FINDS NEW PARTICLES BUT THEY DON'T FIT THIS PATTERN WELL THAT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING BUT BAD FOR THIS E EIGHT THEORY AND OF COURSE BAD FOR ME PERSONALLY
GarrettLisi_2008 NOW HOW BAD WOULD THAT BE
GarrettLisi_2008 BUT PREDICTING HOW NATURE WORKS IS A VERY RISKY GAME
GarrettLisi_2008 THIS THEORY AND OTHERS LIKE IT ARE LONG SHOTS
GarrettLisi_2008 DOES A LOT OF HARD WORK KNOWING THAT MOST OF THESE IDEAS PROBABLY WON 'T END UP BEING TRUE ABOUT NATURE THAT'S WHAT DOING THEORETICAL PHYSICS IS LIKE THERE ARE A LOT OF WIPEOUTS
GarrettLisi_2008 IN THIS REGARD NEW PHYSICS THEORIES ARE A LOT LIKE START UP COMPANIES
GarrettLisi_2008 AS WITH ANY LARGE INVESTMENT IT CAN BE EMOTIONALLY DIFFICULT TO ABANDON A LINE OF RESEARCH WHEN IT ISN'T WORKING OUT
GarrettLisi_2008 NOW THE ONLY WAY TO MAINTAIN SANITY AND ACHIEVE HAPPINESS IN THE MIDST OF THIS UNCERTAINTY
GarrettLisi_2008 IS TO KEEP BALANCE AND PERSPECTIVE IN LIFE
GarrettLisi_2008 TRIED THE BEST I CAN TO LIVE A BALANCED LIFE
GarrettLisi_2008 I TRY TO BALANCE MY LIFE EQUALLY BETWEEN PHYSICS LOVE AND SURFING MY OWN THREE CHARGE DIRECTIONS
GarrettLisi_2008 LET YOU IN ON THAT SECRET
GarrettLisi_2008 YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT THESE BEAUTIFUL VIEWS ARE SIMILAR BUT IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PLACES
GarrettLisi_2008 THAT'S BECAUSE THIS USED TO BE MY HOME AND OFFICE ON MAUI
GarrettLisi_2008 I'VE CHOSEN A VERY UNUSUAL LIFE
GarrettLisi_2008 LIVING A NOMADIC EXISTENCE HAS BEEN HARD AT TIMES BUT IT'S ALLOWED ME TO LIVE IN BEAUTIFUL PLACES AND KEEP A BALANCE IN MY LIFE THAT
GarrettLisi_2008 WITH HYPER INTELLIGENT CORAL
GarrettLisi_2008 TWO PERCENT OF THAT BUT I STILL ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT
GarrettLisi_2008 SO I'M GOING TO SOUND DUMB YOUR
GarrettLisi_2008 OF EVERYTHING GARRETT LISI I'M USED TO CORAL CA THAT'S RIGHT THE REASON IT'S GOT A FEW PEOPLE AT LEAST EXCITED IS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE RIGHT IT BRINGS GRAVITY AND QUANTUM THEORY TOGETHER
GarrettLisi_2008 SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT WE SHOULD THINK OF THE UNIVERSE AT ITS HEART THAT THE SMALLEST THINGS THAT THERE ARE ARE SOMEHOW
GarrettLisi_2008 RIGHT NOW THE PATTERN I SHOWED YOU THAT CORRESPONDS TO WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT ELEMENTARY PARTICLE PHYSICS THAT ALREADY CORRESPONDS TO A VERY BEAUTIFUL SHAPE AND THAT'S THE ONE THAT I SAID WE KNEW FOR CERTAIN
GarrettLisi_2008 AND THAT SHAPE HAS REMARKABLE SIMILARITIES AND THE WAY IT FITS INTO THIS E EIGHT PATTERN COULD BE THE REST OF THE PICTURE
GarrettLisi_2008 AND THESE PATTERNS OF POINTS THAT I'VE SHOWN FOR YOU ACTUALLY REPRESENT SYMMETRIES OF THIS HIGH DIMENSIONAL OBJECT
GarrettLisi_2008 THAT WOULD BE WARPING AND MOVING AND DANCING OVER THE SPACE TIME THAT WE EXPERIENCE AND THAT WOULD BE WHAT EXPLAINS ALL THESE ELEMENTARY PARTICLES THAT WE SEE
GarrettLisi_2008 IN RELATION TO E EIGHT
GarrettLisi_2008 IT WOULD BE ONE OF THE SYMMETRIES OF THIS E EIGHT SHAPE
GarrettLisi_2008 SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS AS THE SHAPE IS MOVING OVER SPACE TIME IT'S TWISTING
GarrettLisi_2008 AND THE DIRECTION IT'S TWISTING AS IT MOVES IS WHAT PARTICLE WE SEE SO
GarrettLisi_2008 THE SIZE OF THE E EIGHT SHAPE HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO THE ELECTRON I KIND OF FEEL LIKE I NEED THAT FOR MY PICTURE IS IT BIGGER IS
GarrettLisi_2008 IN THIS WAY THE WAY THAT E EIGHT COMES IN IS IT WILL BE AS A SHAPE THAT'S ATTACHED AT EACH POINT IN SPACE TIME
GarrettLisi_2008 AS I SAID THE WAY THE SHAPE TWISTS THE DIRECTIONAL ALONG WHICH WAY THE SHAPE IS TWISTING AS IT MOVES OVER THIS CURVED SURFACE
GarrettLisi_2008 IS WHAT THE ELEMENTARY PARTICLES ARE THEMSELVES SO
GarrettLisi_2008 IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IT'S EVOKING A KIND OF SENSE OF WONDER AND I CERTAINLY WANT TO
