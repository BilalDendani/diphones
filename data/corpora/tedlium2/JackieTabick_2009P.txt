JackieTabick_2009P ONE OF MY FAVORITE CARTOON CHARACTERS IS SNOOPY I LOVE THE WAY HE SITS AND LIES ON HIS KENNEL AND CONTEMPLATES THE GREAT THINGS OF LIFE
JackieTabick_2009P SO WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT COMPASSION MY MIND IMMEDIATELY WENT TO ONE OF THE CARTOON STRIPS WHERE HE 'S LYING THERE
JackieTabick_2009P AND HE SAYS I REALLY UNDERSTAND AND I REALLY APPRECIATE HOW ONE SHOULD LOVE ONE 'S NEIGHBOR AS ONE LOVE 'S ONESELF
JackieTabick_2009P IS THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR I CAN'T STAND THEM THIS IN A WAY IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF HOW TO
JackieTabick_2009P A REALLY GOOD IDEA WE ALL I THINK BELIEVE IN COMPASSION IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE WORLD RELIGIONS ALL THE MAIN WORLD RELIGIONS
JackieTabick_2009P WITHIN THEM SOME TEACHING CONCERNING COMPASSION SO IN JUDAISM WE HAVE FROM OUR TORAH THAT YOU SHOULD LOVE YOU NEIGHBOR AS YOU LOVE YOURSELF
JackieTabick_2009P AND WITHIN JEWISH TEACHINGS THE RABBINIC TEACHINGS WE HAVE HILLEL WHO TAUGHT THAT YOU SHOULDN 'T DO TO OTHERS WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE BEING DONE TO YOURSELF
JackieTabick_2009P AND ALL THE MAIN RELIGIONS HAVE SIMILAR TEACHINGS AND AGAIN WITHIN JUDAISM WE HAVE
JackieTabick_2009P TEACHING ABOUT GOD WHO IS CALLED THE COMPASSIONATE ONE HA RACHAMAN AFTER ALL HOW COULD THE WORLD EXIST WITHOUT GOD BEING COMPASSIONATE
JackieTabick_2009P AND WE AS TAUGHT WITHIN THE TORAH THAT WE ARE MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD SO WE TOO HAVE TO BE COMPASSIONATE
JackieTabick_2009P BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN HOW DOES IT IMPACT ON OUR EVERYDAY LIFE SOMETIMES OF COURSE BEING COMPASSIONATE CAN PRODUCE FEELINGS WITHIN US THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL
JackieTabick_2009P I KNOW THERE ARE MANY TIMES WHEN I'VE GONE AND CONDUCTED A FUNERAL OR WHEN I HAVE BEEN SITTING WITH THE BEREAVED OR WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING
JackieTabick_2009P AND I AM OVERWHELMED BY THE SADNESS BY THE
JackieTabick_2009P DIFFICULTY THE CHALLENGE THAT IS THERE FOR THE FAMILY FOR THE PERSON AND I'M TOUCHED SO THAT TEARS COME TO MY EYES
JackieTabick_2009P AND YET IF I JUST ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THESE FEELINGS I WOULDN'T BE DOING MY JOB
JackieTabick_2009P BECAUSE I HAVE TO ACTUALLY BE THERE FOR THEM AND MAKE SURE THAT RITUALS HAPPEN THAT PRACTICALITIES ARE SEEN TO
JackieTabick_2009P AND YET ON THE OTHER HAND IF I DIDN'T FEEL THIS COMPASSION THEN I FEEL THAT IT WOULD BE TIME FOR ME TO HANG UP MY ROBE AND GIVE UP BEING
JackieTabick_2009P AND THESE SAME FEELINGS ARE THERE FOR ALL OF US AS WE FACE THE WORLD WHO CAN NOT BE TOUCHED BY COMPASSION WHEN WE SEE THE TERRIBLE
JackieTabick_2009P WAR
JackieTabick_2009P SOME PEOPLE WHO SAY WELL YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST SO MUCH OUT THERE I CAN'T DO ANYTHING I NOT GOING TO EVEN BEGIN TO TRY
JackieTabick_2009P AND THERE ARE SOME CHARITY WORKERS WHO CALL THIS COMPASSION FATIGUE THERE ARE
JackieTabick_2009P WHO FEEL THEY CAN'T CONFRONT COMPASSION ANYMORE AND SO THEY TURN OFF THE TELEVISION AND DON'T
JackieTabick_2009P IN JUDAISM THOUGH WE TEND TO ALWAYS SAY
JackieTabick_2009P HAS TO BE A MIDDLE WAY YOU HAVE TO OF COURSE BE AWARE OF THE NEEDS OF OTHERS
JackieTabick_2009P OF COMPASSION HAS TO BE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT MAKES PEOPLE TICK
JackieTabick_2009P AND OF COURSE YOU CAN'T DO THAT UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND YOURSELF A BIT MORE AND THERE'S A LOVELY RABBINIC INTERPRETATION OF THE BEGINNINGS OF CREATION WHICH SAYS THAT WHEN GOD CREATED THE WORLD
JackieTabick_2009P GOD THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO CREATE THE WORLD ONLY WITH THE DIVINE ATTRIBUTE OF JUSTICE
JackieTabick_2009P THOUGHT
JackieTabick_2009P IN FACT IF THE WORLD WAS JUST FILLED WITH COMPASSION THERE WOULD BE ANARCHY AND CHAOS THERE HAS TO BE LIMITS TO ALL THINGS
JackieTabick_2009P THE RABBIS DESCRIBE THIS AS BEING LIKE A KING WHO HAS A BEAUTIFUL FRAGILE GLASS
JackieTabick_2009P AND SO GOD PUT BOTH THESE POSSIBILITIES INTO THE WORLD
JackieTabick_2009P THERE IS SOMETHING MORE THOUGH THAT HAS TO BE
JackieTabick_2009P LIKE SNOOPY WE CAN'T JUST LIE THERE AND THINK GREAT THOUGHTS ABOUT OUR NEIGHBORS WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
JackieTabick_2009P AND SO THERE IS ALSO WITHIN JUDAISM THIS NOTION OF LOVE AND KINDNESS THAT BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT
JackieTabick_2009P ALL THESE THREE THINGS THEN HAVE TO BE MELDED TOGETHER THE IDEA OF JUSTICE
JackieTabick_2009P WHICH GIVES BOUNDARIES TO OUR LIVES AND GIVES US A FEELING OF WHAT'S RIGHT ABOUT LIFE WHAT'S RIGHT ABOUT LIVING WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING SOCIAL JUSTICE
JackieTabick_2009P HAS TO BE A WILLINGNESS TO DO GOOD DEEDS BUT NOT OF COURSE AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR OWN SANITY
JackieTabick_2009P YOU KNOW THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING FOR ANYONE IF YOU OVERDO THINGS AND BALANCING THEM ALL IN THE MIDDLE
JackieTabick_2009P IS THIS NOTION OF COMPASSION WHICH HAS TO BE THERE IF YOU LIKE AT OUR VERY ROOTS
JackieTabick_2009P THIS IDEA OF COMPASSION COMES TO US BECAUSE WE'RE MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD
JackieTabick_2009P WHO IS ULTIMATELY THE COMPASSIONATE ONE WHAT DOES THIS COMPASSION ENTAIL IT ENTAILS UNDERSTANDING THE PAIN OF THE
JackieTabick_2009P BUT EVEN MORE THAN THAT IT MEANS UNDERSTANDING
JackieTabick_2009P ONE 'S CONNECTION TO THE WHOLE OF CREATION
JackieTabick_2009P THAT UNDERSTANDING THAT ONE IS PART OF THAT CREATION THAT THERE IS A UNITY THAT UNDERLIES
JackieTabick_2009P ALL THAT WE SEE ALL THAT WE HEAR ALL THAT WE FEEL
JackieTabick_2009P I CALL THAT UNITY GOD
JackieTabick_2009P AND THAT THAT UNITY IS SOMETHING THAT CONNECTS ALL OF CREATION AND OF COURSE IN THE MODERN WORLD WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT WE'RE BECOMING EVEN MORE AWARE
JackieTabick_2009P THE CONNECTIVITY OF THINGS THAT SOMETHING I DO HERE ACTUALLY DOES MATTER IN AFRICA THAT IF I USE TOO MUCH OF MY CARBON ALLOWANCE IT SEEMS TO BE THAT WE ARE CAUSING
JackieTabick_2009P A GREAT LACK OF RAIN IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN AFRICA
JackieTabick_2009P SO THERE IS A CONNECTIVITY AND I HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AS PART OF PART OF THE CREATION AS PART OF ME BEING MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD AND I HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
JackieTabick_2009P THAT MY NEEDS SOMETIMES HAVE TO BE SUBLIMATED TO OTHER NEEDS THIS EIGHTEEN MINUTES BUSINESS
JackieTabick_2009P I FIND QUITE FASCINATING BECAUSE IN JUDAISM THE WORD THE NUMBER EIGHTEEN IN HEBREW LETTERS STANDS FOR LIFE THE WORD LIFE
JackieTabick_2009P SO IN A SENSE THE EIGHTEEN MINUTES IS CHALLENGING ME TO SAY
JackieTabick_2009P IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF COMPASSION BUT SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL ACTUALLY EIGHTEEN MINUTES IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE AT PASSOVER WHEN WE HAVE TO EAT
JackieTabick_2009P WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOUGH THAT IS MADE INTO BREAD AND DOUGH THAT IS MADE INTO UNLEAVENED BREAD MATZAH AND THEY SAY IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES
JackieTabick_2009P SHOULD REVOLVE ROUND US SO WE TRY AND GET RID OF THOSE AND
JackieTabick_2009P TRY TO GET RID OF THE HABITS THE EMOTIONS THE IDEAS THAT ENSLAVE US THAT MAKE
JackieTabick_2009P IS A BASIS FOR HAVING COMPASSION FOR UNDERSTANDING OUR PLACE IN THE WORLD
JackieTabick_2009P NOW THERE IS IN JUDAISM A GORGEOUS STORY OF A RICH MAN WHO SAT IN SYNAGOGUE ONE DAY
JackieTabick_2009P MANY PEOPLE DO HE WAS DOZING OFF DURING THE SERMON AND AS HE WAS DOZING OFF THEY WERE READING FROM THE BOOK OF LEVITICUS IN THE TORAH
JackieTabick_2009P WHICH THEY USED TO PLACE INTO A SPECIAL TABLE IN THE TEMPLE IN JERUSALEM
JackieTabick_2009P THE MAN WAS ASLEEP BUT HE HEARD THE WORDS BREAD TEMPLE GOD AND
JackieTabick_2009P AND HE
JackieTabick_2009P AND AFTER THE SABBATH HE MADE TWELVE LOAVES OF BREAD
JackieTabick_2009P TORAH THEN HE WENT HOME THE CLEANER CAME INTO THE SYNAGOGUE
JackieTabick_2009P SUCH TROUBLE I'VE GOT CHILDREN TO FEED MY WIFE 'S ILL I'VE GOT NO MONEY WHAT CAN I DO
JackieTabick_2009P MY
JackieTabick_2009P NEXT WEEK WITH RAISINS THIS WENT ON FOR YEARS EVERY WEEK THE MAN WOULD BRING BREAD
JackieTabick_2009P AND SAW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND HE CALLED THE TWO OF THEM TO HIS OFFICE AND HE SAID YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING
JackieTabick_2009P AND THE RICH MAN
JackieTabick_2009P OF COURSE WHAT YOU ARE DOING HE SAID TO THE RICH MAN IS ANSWERING GOD 'S PLEA THAT WE SHOULD BE COMPASSIONATE
JackieTabick_2009P AND GOD HE SAID TO THE POOR MAN IS ANSWERING YOUR PLEA THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE COMPASSIONATE AND
JackieTabick_2009P HE LOOKED AT THE RICH MAN HE HELD THE RICH MAN 'S HANDS AND SAID DON 'T YOU UNDERSTAND HE SAID THESE ARE THE HANDS OF GOD
JackieTabick_2009P SO THAT IS THE WAY
JackieTabick_2009P UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS A CONNECTIVITY THAT THERE IS A UNITY IN THIS WORLD THAT I WANT TO TRY AND
JackieTabick_2009P THAT UNITY AND THAT I CAN TRY AND DO THAT BY UNDERSTANDING I HOPE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING OF THE PAIN OF
JackieTabick_2009P THAT I HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE LIMITS TO MY ENERGY TO THE GIVING I CAN GIVE I HAVE TO REEVALUATE THEM TRY AND
JackieTabick_2009P SEPARATE OUT THE MATERIAL THINGS AND MY EMOTIONS THAT MAY BE ENSLAVING ME
JackieTabick_2009P SO THAT I CAN SEE THE WORLD CLEARLY AND THEN I HAVE TO TRY TO SEE
JackieTabick_2009P IN WHAT WAYS I CAN MAKE THESE THE HANDS OF GOD AND SO TRY TO BRING COMPASSION TO LIFE
