JackieTabick_2009P@17.11:27.76 ONE OF MY FAVORITE CARTOON CHARACTERS IS SNOOPY I LOVE THE WAY HE SITS AND LIES ON HIS KENNEL AND CONTEMPLATES THE GREAT THINGS OF LIFE
JackieTabick_2009P@28.37:35.85 SO WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT COMPASSION MY MIND IMMEDIATELY WENT TO ONE OF THE CARTOON STRIPS WHERE HE 'S LYING THERE
JackieTabick_2009P@36.21:45.57 AND HE SAYS I REALLY UNDERSTAND AND I REALLY APPRECIATE HOW ONE SHOULD LOVE ONE 'S NEIGHBOR AS ONE LOVE 'S ONESELF
JackieTabick_2009P@47.65:58.38 IS THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR I CAN'T STAND THEM THIS IN A WAY IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF HOW TO
JackieTabick_2009P@59.18:67.10 A REALLY GOOD IDEA WE ALL I THINK BELIEVE IN COMPASSION IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE WORLD RELIGIONS ALL THE MAIN WORLD RELIGIONS
JackieTabick_2009P@68.46:79.24 WITHIN THEM SOME TEACHING CONCERNING COMPASSION SO IN JUDAISM WE HAVE FROM OUR TORAH THAT YOU SHOULD LOVE YOU NEIGHBOR AS YOU LOVE YOURSELF
JackieTabick_2009P@79.75:89.11 AND WITHIN JEWISH TEACHINGS THE RABBINIC TEACHINGS WE HAVE HILLEL WHO TAUGHT THAT YOU SHOULDN 'T DO TO OTHERS WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE BEING DONE TO YOURSELF
JackieTabick_2009P@89.73:96.83 AND ALL THE MAIN RELIGIONS HAVE SIMILAR TEACHINGS AND AGAIN WITHIN JUDAISM WE HAVE
JackieTabick_2009P@97.53:106.54 TEACHING ABOUT GOD WHO IS CALLED THE COMPASSIONATE ONE HA RACHAMAN AFTER ALL HOW COULD THE WORLD EXIST WITHOUT GOD BEING COMPASSIONATE
JackieTabick_2009P@107.28:115.60 AND WE AS TAUGHT WITHIN THE TORAH THAT WE ARE MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD SO WE TOO HAVE TO BE COMPASSIONATE
JackieTabick_2009P@116.34:130.56 BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN HOW DOES IT IMPACT ON OUR EVERYDAY LIFE SOMETIMES OF COURSE BEING COMPASSIONATE CAN PRODUCE FEELINGS WITHIN US THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL
JackieTabick_2009P@131.20:142.64 I KNOW THERE ARE MANY TIMES WHEN I'VE GONE AND CONDUCTED A FUNERAL OR WHEN I HAVE BEEN SITTING WITH THE BEREAVED OR WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING
JackieTabick_2009P@143.36:150.96 AND I AM OVERWHELMED BY THE SADNESS BY THE
JackieTabick_2009P@152.05:160.51 DIFFICULTY THE CHALLENGE THAT IS THERE FOR THE FAMILY FOR THE PERSON AND I'M TOUCHED SO THAT TEARS COME TO MY EYES
JackieTabick_2009P@161.51:168.02 AND YET IF I JUST ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THESE FEELINGS I WOULDN'T BE DOING MY JOB
JackieTabick_2009P@169.07:179.11 BECAUSE I HAVE TO ACTUALLY BE THERE FOR THEM AND MAKE SURE THAT RITUALS HAPPEN THAT PRACTICALITIES ARE SEEN TO
JackieTabick_2009P@179.85:191.04 AND YET ON THE OTHER HAND IF I DIDN'T FEEL THIS COMPASSION THEN I FEEL THAT IT WOULD BE TIME FOR ME TO HANG UP MY ROBE AND GIVE UP BEING
JackieTabick_2009P@192.67:205.20 AND THESE SAME FEELINGS ARE THERE FOR ALL OF US AS WE FACE THE WORLD WHO CAN NOT BE TOUCHED BY COMPASSION WHEN WE SEE THE TERRIBLE
JackieTabick_2009P@207.04:208.47 WAR
JackieTabick_2009P@213.55:222.06 SOME PEOPLE WHO SAY WELL YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST SO MUCH OUT THERE I CAN'T DO ANYTHING I NOT GOING TO EVEN BEGIN TO TRY
JackieTabick_2009P@223.73:229.75 AND THERE ARE SOME CHARITY WORKERS WHO CALL THIS COMPASSION FATIGUE THERE ARE
JackieTabick_2009P@230.93:238.48 WHO FEEL THEY CAN'T CONFRONT COMPASSION ANYMORE AND SO THEY TURN OFF THE TELEVISION AND DON'T
JackieTabick_2009P@242.05:245.02 IN JUDAISM THOUGH WE TEND TO ALWAYS SAY
JackieTabick_2009P@245.98:254.43 HAS TO BE A MIDDLE WAY YOU HAVE TO OF COURSE BE AWARE OF THE NEEDS OF OTHERS
JackieTabick_2009P@264.10:271.69 OF COMPASSION HAS TO BE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT MAKES PEOPLE TICK
JackieTabick_2009P@272.33:285.96 AND OF COURSE YOU CAN'T DO THAT UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND YOURSELF A BIT MORE AND THERE'S A LOVELY RABBINIC INTERPRETATION OF THE BEGINNINGS OF CREATION WHICH SAYS THAT WHEN GOD CREATED THE WORLD
JackieTabick_2009P@286.88:296.45 GOD THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO CREATE THE WORLD ONLY WITH THE DIVINE ATTRIBUTE OF JUSTICE
JackieTabick_2009P@310.68:311.25 THOUGHT
JackieTabick_2009P@320.70:330.99 IN FACT IF THE WORLD WAS JUST FILLED WITH COMPASSION THERE WOULD BE ANARCHY AND CHAOS THERE HAS TO BE LIMITS TO ALL THINGS
JackieTabick_2009P@331.20:340.55 THE RABBIS DESCRIBE THIS AS BEING LIKE A KING WHO HAS A BEAUTIFUL FRAGILE GLASS
JackieTabick_2009P@353.69:358.63 AND SO GOD PUT BOTH THESE POSSIBILITIES INTO THE WORLD
JackieTabick_2009P@361.93:363.75 THERE IS SOMETHING MORE THOUGH THAT HAS TO BE
JackieTabick_2009P@378.11:385.92 LIKE SNOOPY WE CAN'T JUST LIE THERE AND THINK GREAT THOUGHTS ABOUT OUR NEIGHBORS WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
JackieTabick_2009P@386.97:393.46 AND SO THERE IS ALSO WITHIN JUDAISM THIS NOTION OF LOVE AND KINDNESS THAT BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT
JackieTabick_2009P@396.23:404.06 ALL THESE THREE THINGS THEN HAVE TO BE MELDED TOGETHER THE IDEA OF JUSTICE
JackieTabick_2009P@404.73:417.56 WHICH GIVES BOUNDARIES TO OUR LIVES AND GIVES US A FEELING OF WHAT'S RIGHT ABOUT LIFE WHAT'S RIGHT ABOUT LIVING WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING SOCIAL JUSTICE
JackieTabick_2009P@418.46:427.96 HAS TO BE A WILLINGNESS TO DO GOOD DEEDS BUT NOT OF COURSE AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR OWN SANITY
JackieTabick_2009P@428.07:434.70 YOU KNOW THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING FOR ANYONE IF YOU OVERDO THINGS AND BALANCING THEM ALL IN THE MIDDLE
JackieTabick_2009P@435.48:443.43 IS THIS NOTION OF COMPASSION WHICH HAS TO BE THERE IF YOU LIKE AT OUR VERY ROOTS
JackieTabick_2009P@444.55:451.96 THIS IDEA OF COMPASSION COMES TO US BECAUSE WE'RE MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD
JackieTabick_2009P@452.40:461.46 WHO IS ULTIMATELY THE COMPASSIONATE ONE WHAT DOES THIS COMPASSION ENTAIL IT ENTAILS UNDERSTANDING THE PAIN OF THE
JackieTabick_2009P@463.14:468.30 BUT EVEN MORE THAN THAT IT MEANS UNDERSTANDING
JackieTabick_2009P@468.47:473.14 ONE 'S CONNECTION TO THE WHOLE OF CREATION
JackieTabick_2009P@473.49:479.69 THAT UNDERSTANDING THAT ONE IS PART OF THAT CREATION THAT THERE IS A UNITY THAT UNDERLIES
JackieTabick_2009P@479.91:484.39 ALL THAT WE SEE ALL THAT WE HEAR ALL THAT WE FEEL
JackieTabick_2009P@485.88:488.64 I CALL THAT UNITY GOD
JackieTabick_2009P@488.78:498.49 AND THAT THAT UNITY IS SOMETHING THAT CONNECTS ALL OF CREATION AND OF COURSE IN THE MODERN WORLD WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT WE'RE BECOMING EVEN MORE AWARE
JackieTabick_2009P@499.32:512.93 THE CONNECTIVITY OF THINGS THAT SOMETHING I DO HERE ACTUALLY DOES MATTER IN AFRICA THAT IF I USE TOO MUCH OF MY CARBON ALLOWANCE IT SEEMS TO BE THAT WE ARE CAUSING
JackieTabick_2009P@513.16:519.81 A GREAT LACK OF RAIN IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN AFRICA
JackieTabick_2009P@519.90:534.36 SO THERE IS A CONNECTIVITY AND I HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AS PART OF PART OF THE CREATION AS PART OF ME BEING MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD AND I HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
JackieTabick_2009P@535.21:542.40 THAT MY NEEDS SOMETIMES HAVE TO BE SUBLIMATED TO OTHER NEEDS THIS EIGHTEEN MINUTES BUSINESS
JackieTabick_2009P@542.91:552.46 I FIND QUITE FASCINATING BECAUSE IN JUDAISM THE WORD THE NUMBER EIGHTEEN IN HEBREW LETTERS STANDS FOR LIFE THE WORD LIFE
JackieTabick_2009P@553.06:558.23 SO IN A SENSE THE EIGHTEEN MINUTES IS CHALLENGING ME TO SAY
JackieTabick_2009P@559.94:570.51 IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF COMPASSION BUT SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL ACTUALLY EIGHTEEN MINUTES IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE AT PASSOVER WHEN WE HAVE TO EAT
JackieTabick_2009P@573.91:582.75 WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOUGH THAT IS MADE INTO BREAD AND DOUGH THAT IS MADE INTO UNLEAVENED BREAD MATZAH AND THEY SAY IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES
JackieTabick_2009P@614.77:619.63 SHOULD REVOLVE ROUND US SO WE TRY AND GET RID OF THOSE AND
JackieTabick_2009P@622.52:629.40 TRY TO GET RID OF THE HABITS THE EMOTIONS THE IDEAS THAT ENSLAVE US THAT MAKE
JackieTabick_2009P@641.78:649.61 IS A BASIS FOR HAVING COMPASSION FOR UNDERSTANDING OUR PLACE IN THE WORLD
JackieTabick_2009P@651.21:661.49 NOW THERE IS IN JUDAISM A GORGEOUS STORY OF A RICH MAN WHO SAT IN SYNAGOGUE ONE DAY
JackieTabick_2009P@662.92:674.42 MANY PEOPLE DO HE WAS DOZING OFF DURING THE SERMON AND AS HE WAS DOZING OFF THEY WERE READING FROM THE BOOK OF LEVITICUS IN THE TORAH
JackieTabick_2009P@683.09:688.33 WHICH THEY USED TO PLACE INTO A SPECIAL TABLE IN THE TEMPLE IN JERUSALEM
JackieTabick_2009P@690.37:696.33 THE MAN WAS ASLEEP BUT HE HEARD THE WORDS BREAD TEMPLE GOD AND
JackieTabick_2009P@702.58:703.10 AND HE
JackieTabick_2009P@704.34:708.63 AND AFTER THE SABBATH HE MADE TWELVE LOAVES OF BREAD
JackieTabick_2009P@719.08:727.36 TORAH THEN HE WENT HOME THE CLEANER CAME INTO THE SYNAGOGUE
JackieTabick_2009P@728.78:734.48 SUCH TROUBLE I'VE GOT CHILDREN TO FEED MY WIFE 'S ILL I'VE GOT NO MONEY WHAT CAN I DO
JackieTabick_2009P@747.36:747.74 MY
JackieTabick_2009P@774.01:781.03 NEXT WEEK WITH RAISINS THIS WENT ON FOR YEARS EVERY WEEK THE MAN WOULD BRING BREAD
JackieTabick_2009P@795.96:802.83 AND SAW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND HE CALLED THE TWO OF THEM TO HIS OFFICE AND HE SAID YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING
JackieTabick_2009P@804.02:804.88 AND THE RICH MAN
JackieTabick_2009P@827.56:836.28 OF COURSE WHAT YOU ARE DOING HE SAID TO THE RICH MAN IS ANSWERING GOD 'S PLEA THAT WE SHOULD BE COMPASSIONATE
JackieTabick_2009P@837.02:843.78 AND GOD HE SAID TO THE POOR MAN IS ANSWERING YOUR PLEA THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE COMPASSIONATE AND
JackieTabick_2009P@845.59:857.65 HE LOOKED AT THE RICH MAN HE HELD THE RICH MAN 'S HANDS AND SAID DON 'T YOU UNDERSTAND HE SAID THESE ARE THE HANDS OF GOD
JackieTabick_2009P@862.46:865.97 SO THAT IS THE WAY
JackieTabick_2009P@875.92:883.03 UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS A CONNECTIVITY THAT THERE IS A UNITY IN THIS WORLD THAT I WANT TO TRY AND
JackieTabick_2009P@884.11:893.41 THAT UNITY AND THAT I CAN TRY AND DO THAT BY UNDERSTANDING I HOPE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING OF THE PAIN OF
JackieTabick_2009P@903.15:913.14 THAT I HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE LIMITS TO MY ENERGY TO THE GIVING I CAN GIVE I HAVE TO REEVALUATE THEM TRY AND
JackieTabick_2009P@913.65:920.44 SEPARATE OUT THE MATERIAL THINGS AND MY EMOTIONS THAT MAY BE ENSLAVING ME
JackieTabick_2009P@921.31:928.48 SO THAT I CAN SEE THE WORLD CLEARLY AND THEN I HAVE TO TRY TO SEE
JackieTabick_2009P@928.96:939.30 IN WHAT WAYS I CAN MAKE THESE THE HANDS OF GOD AND SO TRY TO BRING COMPASSION TO LIFE
