StevenStrogatz_2004R WAS TRYING TO THINK HOW IS SYNC CONNECTED TO HAPPINESS AND IT OCCURRED TO ME
StevenStrogatz_2004R FOR SOME REASON WE TAKE PLEASURE IN SYNCHRONIZING
StevenStrogatz_2004R WE LIKE TO DANCE TOGETHER WE LIKE SINGING TOGETHER AND SO IF YOU'LL PUT UP WITH THIS I WOULD LIKE TO
StevenStrogatz_2004R NOTICE BY THE WAY THAT WHEN YOU APPLAUDED THAT YOU DID IT IN A TYPICAL NORTH AMERICAN WAY THAT IS YOU WERE RAUCOUS AND INCOHERENT
StevenStrogatz_2004R YOU THINK YOU COULD DO IT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THIS AUDIENCE WOULD NO YOU HAVEN'T PRACTICED AS FAR AS I KNOW
StevenStrogatz_2004R NOW THAT'S WHAT WE CALL EMERGENT BEHAVIOR
StevenStrogatz_2004R SO I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BUT I MEAN I EXPECTED YOU COULD SYNCHRONIZE IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME YOU'D INCREASE YOUR FREQUENCY IT'S INTERESTING
StevenStrogatz_2004R SO WHAT DO WE MAKE OF THAT FIRST OF ALL WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE ALL BRILLIANT
StevenStrogatz_2004R THIS IS A ROOM FULL OF INTELLIGENT PEOPLE HIGHLY SENSITIVE
StevenStrogatz_2004R SOME TRAINED MUSICIANS OUT THERE
StevenStrogatz_2004R IS THAT WHAT ENABLED YOU TO SYNCHRONIZE SO TO PUT THE QUESTION A LITTLE MORE SERIOUSLY LET 'S ASK OURSELVES WHAT ARE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR WHAT YOU JUST DID FOR SPONTANEOUS SYNCHRONIZATION
StevenStrogatz_2004R DO YOU NEED FOR INSTANCE TO BE AS SMART AS YOU ARE
StevenStrogatz_2004R DO YOU EVEN NEED A BRAIN AT ALL
StevenStrogatz_2004R DO YOU NEED TO BE ALIVE
StevenStrogatz_2004R THAT'S A SPOOKY THOUGHT RIGHT INANIMATE OBJECTS THAT MIGHT SPONTANEOUSLY SYNCHRONIZE THEMSELVES
StevenStrogatz_2004R IT'S REAL IN FACT I'LL TRY TO EXPLAIN TODAY THAT SYNC IS MAYBE ONE OF IF NOT
StevenStrogatz_2004R ONE OF THE MOST PERHAPS THE MOST PERVASIVE DRIVE IN ALL OF NATURE IT EXTENDS FROM THE SUBATOMIC SCALE
StevenStrogatz_2004R TO THE FARTHEST REACHES OF THE COSMOS
StevenStrogatz_2004R IT'S A DEEP TENDENCY TOWARD ORDER IN NATURE THAT OPPOSES WHAT WE'VE ALL BEEN TAUGHT ABOUT ENTROPY I MEAN I'M NOT SAYING THE LAW OF ENTROPY IS WRONG IT'S NOT
StevenStrogatz_2004R BUT THERE IS A COUNTERVAILING FORCE IN THE UNIVERSE THE TENDENCY TOWARDS SPONTANEOUS ORDER AND SO THAT'S OUR THEME NOW TO GET INTO THAT
StevenStrogatz_2004R LET ME BEGIN WITH WHAT MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED TO YOU IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU HEAR THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SYNCHRONY IN NATURE WHICH IS THE GLORIOUS EXAMPLE
StevenStrogatz_2004R BIRDS THAT FLOCK TOGETHER OR FISH SWIMMING IN ORGANIZED SCHOOLS SO
StevenStrogatz_2004R THESE ARE NOT PARTICULARLY INTELLIGENT CREATURES AND YET AS WE'LL SEE THEY EXHIBIT BEAUTIFUL BALLETS
StevenStrogatz_2004R TO
StevenStrogatz_2004R WE'RE SO USED TO CHOREOGRAPHY GIVING RISE TO SYNCHRONY THESE CREATURES ARE NOT CHOREOGRAPHED THEY'RE CHOREOGRAPHING THEMSELVES
StevenStrogatz_2004R YOU
StevenStrogatz_2004R A COMPUTER MODEL MADE BY IAN KUZAN A RESEARCHER AT OXFORD
StevenStrogatz_2004R THAT SHOWS HOW SWARMS WORK THERE ARE JUST THREE SIMPLE RULES FIRST
StevenStrogatz_2004R SECOND ALL THE INDIVIDUALS HAVE A TENDENCY TO LINE UP AND THIRD THEY'RE ALL ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHER
StevenStrogatz_2004R NOW FISH LIKE TO STAY CLOSE TOGETHER ABOUT A BODY LENGTH APART
StevenStrogatz_2004R BIRDS TRY TO STAY ABOUT THREE OR FOUR BODY LENGTHS APART BUT EXCEPT FOR THAT
StevenStrogatz_2004R THE RULES ARE THE SAME FOR BOTH
StevenStrogatz_2004R ALL THIS CHANGES WHEN A PREDATOR ENTERS THE SCENE
StevenStrogatz_2004R PREY MOVE OUT IN RANDOM DIRECTIONS AND THEN THE RULE OF ATTRACTION BRINGS THEM BACK TOGETHER AGAIN
StevenStrogatz_2004R SO THERE'S THIS CONSTANT SPLITTING AND REFORMING
StevenStrogatz_2004R AND YOU SEE THAT IN NATURE
StevenStrogatz_2004R KEEP IN MIND THAT ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS AS IF
StevenStrogatz_2004R EACH INDIVIDUAL IS ACTING TO COOPERATE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON IS A KIND OF SELFISH DARWINIAN BEHAVIOR
StevenStrogatz_2004R EACH IS SCATTERING AWAY AT RANDOM TO TRY TO SAVE ITS SCALES OR FEATHERS
StevenStrogatz_2004R THAT IS OUT OF THE DESIRE TO SAVE ITSELF EACH CREATURE IS FOLLOWING THESE RULES AND THAT LEADS TO SOMETHING THAT'S SAFE FOR ALL OF THEM EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE THINKING AS A GROUP
StevenStrogatz_2004R YOU MIGHT WONDER WHAT EXACTLY IS THE ADVANTAGE TO BEING IN A SWARM SO YOU CAN THINK OF SEVERAL
StevenStrogatz_2004R AS I SAY IF YOU'RE IN A SWARM YOUR ODDS OF BEING THE UNLUCKY ONE ARE REDUCED
StevenStrogatz_2004R AS COMPARED TO A SMALL
StevenStrogatz_2004R THERE ARE MANY EYES TO SPOT DANGER AND YOU'LL SEE IN
StevenStrogatz_2004R THE EXAMPLE WITH THE STARLINGS WITH THE BIRDS WHEN THIS PEREGRINE HAWK IS ABOUT TO ATTACK THEM THAT ACTUALLY WAVES OF PANIC CAN PROPAGATE
StevenStrogatz_2004R SENDING MESSAGES OVER GREAT DISTANCES YOU'LL SEE
StevenStrogatz_2004R CAN BE SENT OVER HALF A KILOMETER AWAY IN A VERY SHORT TIME THROUGH THIS MECHANISM
StevenStrogatz_2004R BEAUTIFUL THE BIRDS ARE WE SORT OF UNDERSTAND WE THINK
StevenStrogatz_2004R FROM THAT COMPUTER MODEL WHAT'S GOING ON AS I SAY IT'S JUST THOSE THREE SIMPLE RULES PLUS THE ONE ABOUT WATCH OUT FOR PREDATORS THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANYTHING MYSTICAL ABOUT THIS
StevenStrogatz_2004R WE DON 'T HOWEVER REALLY UNDERSTAND AT A MATHEMATICAL LEVEL I'M A MATHEMATICIAN WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND BETTER
StevenStrogatz_2004R I MEAN I SHOWED YOU A COMPUTER MODEL BUT A COMPUTER IS NOT UNDERSTANDING A COMPUTER IS IN A WAY JUST ANOTHER EXPERIMENT WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE A DEEPER INSIGHT INTO HOW THIS WORKS AND TO UNDERSTAND
StevenStrogatz_2004R YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THIS ORGANIZATION COMES FROM HOW DO THE RULES GIVE RISE TO THE PATTERNS THERE IS ONE CASE THAT WE HAVE BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND BETTER AND IT'S THE CASE OF FIREFLIES
StevenStrogatz_2004R IF YOU SEE FIREFLIES IN NORTH AMERICA LIKE SO MANY NORTH AMERICAN SORTS OF THINGS THEY TEND TO BE INDEPENDENT OPERATORS THEY IGNORE EACH OTHER
StevenStrogatz_2004R THEY EACH DO THEIR OWN THING FLASHING ON AND OFF PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THEIR NEIGHBORS BUT IN SOUTHEAST ASIA PLACES LIKE THAILAND OR MALAYSIA OR BORNEO
StevenStrogatz_2004R THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL COOPERATIVE BEHAVIOR THAT OCCURS AMONG MALE FIREFLIES YOU CAN SEE IT EVERY NIGHT ALONG THE RIVER BANKS THE TREES MANGROVE TREES ARE FILLED WITH FIREFLIES COMMUNICATING WITH LIGHT
StevenStrogatz_2004R TO REINFORCE A MESSAGE TO THE FEMALES
StevenStrogatz_2004R TO SHOW YOU A SLOW MOTION OF A SINGLE FIREFLY SO THAT YOU CAN GET A SENSE THIS IS A SINGLE FRAME
StevenStrogatz_2004R SECOND THERE AND THEN WATCH THIS WHOLE RIVER BANK AND WATCH HOW PRECISE THE SYNCHRONY IS
StevenStrogatz_2004R ON MORE
StevenStrogatz_2004R CAN USE THEM AS NAVIGATING BEACONS TO FIND THEIR WAY BACK TO THEIR HOME RIVERS
StevenStrogatz_2004R YOU KNOW A HUMAN BEING 'S TENDENCY TO SEE PATTERNS WHERE THERE ARE NONE BUT I HOPE YOU'VE CONVINCED YOURSELF NOW WITH THIS NIGHTTIME VIDEO THAT THEY REALLY WERE VERY WELL SYNCHRONIZED OKAY WELL THE ISSUE THEN IS DO WE NEED TO BE ALIVE
StevenStrogatz_2004R TO SEE THIS KIND OF SPONTANEOUS ORDER AND I'VE ALREADY HINTED THAT THE ANSWER IS NO
StevenStrogatz_2004R WELL YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A WHOLE CREATURE YOU CAN EVEN BE JUST A SINGLE CELL LIKE TAKE FOR INSTANCE YOUR PACEMAKER CELLS IN YOUR HEART RIGHT NOW THEY'RE KEEPING YOU ALIVE EVERY BEAT OF YOUR HEART
StevenStrogatz_2004R DEPENDS ON THIS CRUCIAL REGION THE SINOATRIAL NODE WHICH HAS ABOUT TEN THOUSAND INDEPENDENT CELLS THAT WOULD EACH BEEP
StevenStrogatz_2004R HAVE AN ELECTRICAL RHYTHM A VOLTAGE UP AND DOWN TO SEND A SIGNAL TO THE VENTRICLES TO PUMP NOW YOUR PACEMAKER IS NOT A SINGLE CELL IT'S THIS DEMOCRACY OF TEN THOUSAND CELLS THAT ALL HAVE TO FIRE IN UNISON FOR THE PACEMAKER TO WORK CORRECTLY
StevenStrogatz_2004R I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU THE IDEA THAT SYNCHRONY IS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA IF YOU HAVE EPILEPSY
StevenStrogatz_2004R THERE IS AN INSTANCE OF BILLIONS OF BRAIN CELLS OR AT LEAST MILLIONS DISCHARGING IN PATHOLOGICAL CONCERT
StevenStrogatz_2004R SO THIS TENDENCY TOWARDS ORDER IS NOT ALWAYS A GOOD THING
StevenStrogatz_2004R YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ALIVE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE EVEN A SINGLE CELL IF YOU LOOK FOR INSTANCE AT HOW LASERS WORK THAT WOULD BE A CASE OF ATOMIC SYNCHRONY
StevenStrogatz_2004R IN A LASER WHAT MAKES LASER LIGHT SO DIFFERENT FROM THE LIGHT ABOVE MY HEAD HERE IS THAT THIS LIGHT IS INCOHERENT MANY DIFFERENT COLORS
StevenStrogatz_2004R AND DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES SORT OF LIKE THE WAY YOU CLAPPED INITIALLY
StevenStrogatz_2004R BUT IF YOU WERE A LASER
StevenStrogatz_2004R IT WOULD BE RHYTHMIC APPLAUSE IT WOULD BE ALL ATOMS PULSATING IN UNISON EMITTING LIGHT OF ONE COLOR ONE FREQUENCY
StevenStrogatz_2004R NOW COMES THE VERY RISKY PART OF MY TALK
StevenStrogatz_2004R WHICH IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT INANIMATE THINGS CAN SYNCHRONIZE
StevenStrogatz_2004R WHAT I HAVE HERE ARE TWO EMPTY WATER BOTTLES
StevenStrogatz_2004R ALL RIGHT SO I'VE GOT A METRONOME AND IT'S THE WORLD 'S SMALLEST METRONOME THE
StevenStrogatz_2004R WELL I SHOULDN 'T ADVERTISE ANYWAY SO THIS IS THE WORLD 'S SMALLEST METRONOME I'VE SET IT ON THE FASTEST SETTING AND I'M GOING TO NOW TAKE ANOTHER ONE SET TO THE SAME SETTING
StevenStrogatz_2004R WE CAN TRY THIS FIRST IF I JUST PUT THEM ON THE TABLE TOGETHER
StevenStrogatz_2004R WHAT I'M HOPING IS THAT THEY MIGHT JUST DRIFT APART BECAUSE THEIR FREQUENCIES AREN'T PERFECTLY THE SAME
StevenStrogatz_2004R RIGHT THEY DID THEY WERE IN SYNC FOR A WHILE BUT THEN THEY DRIFTED APART
StevenStrogatz_2004R WELL THEY CAN COMMUNICATE THROUGH MECHANICAL FORCES
StevenStrogatz_2004R SO I'M GOING TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO DO THAT I ALSO WANT TO WIND THIS ONE UP
StevenStrogatz_2004R HOW CAN THEY COMMUNICATE I'M GOING TO PUT THEM ON A MOVABLE PLATFORM
StevenStrogatz_2004R WHICH IS THE GUIDE TO GRADUATE STUDY AT CORNELL
StevenStrogatz_2004R OKAY SO
StevenStrogatz_2004R 'S SEE IF WE CAN GET THIS TO WORK
StevenStrogatz_2004R MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THAT IT WILL WORK BETTER IF I PUT BOTH ON AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE WHOLE THING WILL TIP OVER
StevenStrogatz_2004R RIGHT SO THERE WE GO
StevenStrogatz_2004R I'M NOT TRYING TO CHEAT LET ME START THEM OUT OF SYNC NO HARD TO EVEN DO THAT
StevenStrogatz_2004R RIGHT SO BEFORE ANY ONE GOES OUT OF SYNC I'LL JUST PUT THOSE
StevenStrogatz_2004R NOW THAT MIGHT SEEM A BIT
StevenStrogatz_2004R WHIMSICAL BUT
StevenStrogatz_2004R THIS PERVASIVENESS OF THIS TENDENCY TOWARDS SPONTANEOUS ORDER
StevenStrogatz_2004R THE MILLENNIUM BRIDGE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE PRIDE OF LONDON A BEAUTIFUL NEW FOOTBRIDGE ERECTED ACROSS THE THAMES FIRST RIVER CROSSING IN OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS IN LONDON
StevenStrogatz_2004R AND AN ENGINEERING FIRM
StevenStrogatz_2004R AND TOGETHER THEY SUBMITTED A DESIGN BASED ON LORD FOSTER 'S VISION WHICH WAS HE REMEMBERED AS A KID READING FLASH GORDON COMIC BOOKS
StevenStrogatz_2004R AND HE SAID THAT WHEN FLASH GORDON WOULD COME TO AN ABYSS HE WOULD SHOOT WHAT TODAY WOULD BE A KIND OF A LIGHT SABER HE WOULD SHOOT HIS LIGHT SABER ACROSS THE ABYSS
StevenStrogatz_2004R MAKING A BLADE OF LIGHT AND THEN SCAMPER ACROSS ON THIS BLADE OF LIGHT HE SAID THAT 'S THE VISION I WANT TO GIVE TO LONDON I WANT A BLADE OF LIGHT ACROSS THE THAMES
StevenStrogatz_2004R SO THEY BUILT THE BLADE OF LIGHT
StevenStrogatz_2004R AND IT'S A VERY THIN RIBBON OF STEEL
StevenStrogatz_2004R THE WORLD 'S PROBABLY THE FLATTEST AND THINNEST SUSPENSION BRIDGE THERE IS
StevenStrogatz_2004R THAT ARE OUT ON THE SIDE YOU'RE USED TO SUSPENSION BRIDGES WITH BIG DROOPY CABLES ON THE TOP THESE CABLES WERE ON THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE LIKE IF YOU TOOK A RUBBER BAND AND STRETCHED IT TAUT ACROSS THE THAMES
StevenStrogatz_2004R AND WITHIN TWO DAYS THE BRIDGE WAS CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC
StevenStrogatz_2004R SO I WANT TO FIRST SHOW YOU SOME INTERVIEWS
StevenStrogatz_2004R WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THE BRIDGE ON OPENING DAY WHO WILL DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED
StevenStrogatz_2004R YEAH IT FELT UNSTABLE AND IT WAS VERY WINDY
StevenStrogatz_2004R JUST SIDEWAYS ABOUT HOW MUCH WAS IT MOVING
StevenStrogatz_2004R WAS AT LEAST SIX
StevenStrogatz_2004R SO AT LEAST THIS MUCH
StevenStrogatz_2004R AND THEN SHOW ME WHAT IT WAS LIKE WHEN THE BRIDGE STARTED TO
StevenStrogatz_2004R RIGHT SO YOU HAD TO DELIBERATELY PUSH YOUR FEET OUT SIDEWAYS
StevenStrogatz_2004R THEY DELIBERATELY WALKING IN STEP OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT NO THEY JUST HAD TO CONFORM TO THE
StevenStrogatz_2004R ALL RIGHT SO THAT REALLY GIVES YOU A HINT OF WHAT HAPPENED
StevenStrogatz_2004R THINK OF THE BRIDGE
StevenStrogatz_2004R AS BEING LIKE THIS PLATFORM
StevenStrogatz_2004R THINK OF THE PEOPLE AS BEING LIKE METRONOMES
StevenStrogatz_2004R NOW YOU MIGHT NOT BE USED TO THINKING OF YOURSELF AS A METRONOME BUT AFTER ALL WE DO
StevenStrogatz_2004R WALK LIKE I MEAN WE OSCILLATE BACK AND FORTH AS WE WALK AND ESPECIALLY IF WE START TO WALK LIKE THOSE PEOPLE DID RIGHT THEY ALL SHOWED THIS STRANGE
StevenStrogatz_2004R SORT OF SKATING GAIT THAT THEY ADOPTED ONCE THE BRIDGE STARTED TO MOVE AND SO LET ME SHOW YOU NOW THE FOOTAGE OF THE BRIDGE BUT ALSO AFTER YOU SEE THE BRIDGE ON OPENING DAY YOU'LL SEE AN INTERESTING CLIP OF WORK DONE BY
StevenStrogatz_2004R A BRIDGE ENGINEER AT CAMBRIDGE NAMED ALLAN MCROBIE
StevenStrogatz_2004R WHO FIGURED OUT WHAT HAPPENED ON THE BRIDGE AND WHO BUILT A BRIDGE SIMULATOR TO EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS IT WAS A KIND OF UNINTENDED
StevenStrogatz_2004R RIGHT SO IT WAS QUITE SMALL
StevenStrogatz_2004R THE MOST DRAMATIC AND SHOCKING FOOTAGE SHOWS
StevenStrogatz_2004R HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE APPARENTLY ROCKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN UNISON
StevenStrogatz_2004R THIS SYNCHRONIZED MOVEMENT SEEMED TO BE DRIVING THE BRIDGE
StevenStrogatz_2004R THE CROWD BECOME SYNCHRONIZED
StevenStrogatz_2004R THE SIMULATED BRIDGE IS FINISHED
StevenStrogatz_2004R AND I CAN MAKE IT WOBBLE
StevenStrogatz_2004R THIS YES THIS SIMULATED BRIDGE AND THIS YOU RECKON MIMICS THE ACTION OF THE REAL BRIDGE
StevenStrogatz_2004R ALLAN MCROBIE IS A BRIDGE ENGINEER FROM CAMBRIDGE WHO WROTE TO ME SUGGESTING THAT A BRIDGE SIMULATOR OUGHT TO WOBBLE IN THE SAME WAY AS THE REAL BRIDGE PROVIDED WE HUNG IT ON PENDULUMS OF EXACTLY THE RIGHT LENGTH
StevenStrogatz_2004R WALK YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU PUT YOUR FEET DOWN DON'T YOU BECAUSE
StevenStrogatz_2004R IF YOU GET IT WRONG IT JUST THROWS YOU OFF YOUR FEET
StevenStrogatz_2004R SO ALREADY THE SIMULATOR IS MAKING ME WALK IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS OUR WITNESSES WALKED ON THE REAL BRIDGE
StevenStrogatz_2004R FOR A MORE CONVINCING EXPERIMENT I WANTED MY OWN OPENING DAY CROWD THE SOUND CHECK TEAM THEIR INSTRUCTIONS JUST WALK NORMALLY
StevenStrogatz_2004R IT'S REALLY INTRIGUING BECAUSE
StevenStrogatz_2004R THEY'RE ALL HAVING SOME DIFFICULTY WALKING
StevenStrogatz_2004R ACTUALLY FORCED BY THE MOVEMENT OF THE BRIDGE TO GET INTO STEP AND THEREFORE TO DRIVE IT TO MOVE
StevenStrogatz_2004R ALL RIGHT WELL WITH THAT FROM THE MINISTRY OF SILLY WALKS MAYBE I'D BETTER END I SEE I'VE GONE OVER BUT I HOPE THAT YOU'LL GO OUTSIDE AND SEE THE WORLD IN A NEW WAY TO SEE ALL THE AMAZING SYNCHRONY AROUND US THANK YOU
