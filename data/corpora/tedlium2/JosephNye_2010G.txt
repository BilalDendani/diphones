JosephNye_2010G@16.55:22.62 TALK TO YOU ABOUT POWER IN THIS TWENTY ONE ST CENTURY AND BASICALLY WHAT I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU
JosephNye_2010G@23.14:24.78 IS THAT POWER IS CHANGING
JosephNye_2010G@25.50:32.37 AND THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF CHANGES I WANT TO DISCUSS ONE IS POWER TRANSITION
JosephNye_2010G@33.22:40.22 WHICH IS CHANGE OF POWER AMONGST STATES AND THEY ARE THE SIMPLE VERSION OF THE MESSAGE IS IT'S MOVING FROM WEST
JosephNye_2010G@42.01:44.72 THE OTHER IS POWER DIFFUSION
JosephNye_2010G@45.34:56.77 THE WAY POWER IS MOVING FROM ALL STATES WEST OR EAST TO NON STATE ACTORS THOSE TWO THINGS ARE THE HUGE SHIFTS OF POWER IN OUR CENTURY
JosephNye_2010G@57.19:65.45 AND I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THEM EACH SEPARATELY AND THEN HOW THEY INTERACT AND WHY IN THE END THERE MAY BE SOME GOOD NEWS
JosephNye_2010G@67.13:69.16 WHEN WE TALK ABOUT POWER TRANSITION
JosephNye_2010G@70.20:72.62 WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE RISE OF ASIA
JosephNye_2010G@73.66:77.63 IT REALLY SHOULD BE CALLED THE RECOVERY OR RETURN OF ASIA
JosephNye_2010G@78.13:79.64 IF WE LOOKED AT THE WORLD
JosephNye_2010G@82.32:88.39 YOU'D FIND THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE WORLD 'S PEOPLE LIVED IN ASIA AND THEY MADE MORE THAN HALF THE WORLD 'S PRODUCT
JosephNye_2010G@100.83:102.31 THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
JosephNye_2010G@103.00:109.15 WHICH MEANT THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN EUROPE AND AMERICA BECAME THE DOMINANT CENTER OF THE WORLD
JosephNye_2010G@113.58:118.64 ASIA GRADUALLY RETURNING TO BEING MORE THAN HALF OF THE WORLD 'S POPULATION
JosephNye_2010G@118.93:121.50 AND MORE THAN HALF OF THE WORLD 'S PRODUCT
JosephNye_2010G@122.53:130.92 THAT'S IMPORTANT AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT SHIFT BUT LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE OTHER SHIFT THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS POWER DIFFUSION
JosephNye_2010G@146.74:151.12 NOW THAT'S A BIG ABSTRACT NUMBER BUT TO MAKE IT MORE REAL IF THE PRICE OF
JosephNye_2010G@152.81:165.04 HAD FALLEN AS RAPIDLY AS THE PRICE OF COMPUTING POWER YOU COULD BUY A CAR TODAY FOR FIVE DOLLARS NOW WHEN THE PRICE OF ANY TECHNOLOGY DECLINES THAT DRAMATICALLY
JosephNye_2010G@166.46:170.13 THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY GO DOWN ANYBODY CAN PLAY IN THE GAME
JosephNye_2010G@185.31:186.84 THE TECHNOLOGY WAS THERE
JosephNye_2010G@187.48:191.60 BUT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT YOU HAD TO BE VERY RICH
JosephNye_2010G@192.09:199.28 A GOVERNMENT A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION MAYBE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH BUT YOU HAD TO BE PRETTY WEALTHY
JosephNye_2010G@200.26:208.20 NOW ANYBODY HAS THAT CAPACITY WHICH PREVIOUSLY WAS RESTRICTED BY PRICE JUST TO A FEW ACTORS
JosephNye_2010G@211.88:214.54 LAST TIME I LOOKED IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE A POUND AN HOUR
JosephNye_2010G@224.18:232.12 AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS NOT THAT THE AGE OF THE STATE IS OVER THE STATE STILL MATTERS BUT THE
JosephNye_2010G@234.16:247.42 THE STATE 'S NOT ALONE THERE ARE MANY MANY ACTORS SOME OF THAT'S GOOD OXFAM A GREAT NON GOVERNMENTAL ACTOR SOME OF IT'S BAD AL QAEDA ANOTHER NON GOVERNMENTAL ACTOR
JosephNye_2010G@248.15:256.46 BUT THINK OF WHAT IT DOES TO HOW WE THINK IN TRADITIONAL TERMS AND CONCEPTS WE THINK IN TERMS OF WAR AND INTERSTATE WAR
JosephNye_2010G@264.63:271.31 IT'S WORTH NOTICING THAT A NON STATE ACTOR ATTACKING THE UNITED STATES IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE
JosephNye_2010G@281.18:285.74 SO WE'RE SEEING A GREAT CHANGE IN TERMS OF DIFFUSION OF POWER
JosephNye_2010G@287.13:295.88 NOW THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT IT IN VERY INNOVATIVE WAYS SO LET ME STEP BACK AND ASK WHAT'S POWER
JosephNye_2010G@297.08:301.98 POWER IS SIMPLE THE ABILITY TO AFFECT OTHERS TO GET THE OUTCOMES YOU WANT
JosephNye_2010G@322.70:329.33 OR PAYMENT IS WHAT I CALL SOFT POWER AND THAT SOFT POWER HAS BEEN MUCH NEGLECTED
JosephNye_2010G@329.85:331.56 AND MUCH MISUNDERSTOOD
JosephNye_2010G@332.23:334.30 AND YET IT'S TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT
JosephNye_2010G@335.39:342.45 INDEED IF YOU CAN LEARN TO USE MORE SOFT POWER YOU CAN SAVE A LOT ON CARROTS AND STICKS
JosephNye_2010G@350.46:357.90 FOR EXAMPLE THE GREAT OXFORD HISTORIAN WHO TAUGHT HERE AT THIS UNIVERSITY A J P TAYLOR DEFINED A GREAT POWER
JosephNye_2010G@358.38:361.28 AS A COUNTRY ABLE TO PREVAIL IN WAR
JosephNye_2010G@362.36:370.64 BUT WE NEED A NEW NARRATIVE IF WE'RE TO UNDERSTAND POWER IN THE TWENTY ONE ST CENTURY IT'S NOT JUST PREVAILING AT WAR THOUGH WAR STILL PERSISTS
JosephNye_2010G@371.32:382.21 IT'S NOT WHOSE ARMY WINS IT'S ALSO WHOSE STORY WINS AND WE HAVE TO THINK MUCH MORE IN TERMS OF NARRATIVES AND WHOSE NARRATIVE IS GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE
JosephNye_2010G@383.87:388.58 NOW LET ME GO BACK TO THE QUESTION OF POWER
JosephNye_2010G@394.27:405.67 THAT WE USE NOW TEND TO BE THE RISE AND FALL OF THE GREAT POWERS AND THE CURRENT NARRATIVE IS ALL ABOUT THE RISE OF CHINA AND THE DECLINE OF THE UNITED STATES
JosephNye_2010G@406.18:416.49 INDEED WITH THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT FINANCIAL CRISIS MANY PEOPLE SAID THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF AMERICAN POWER THE TECTONIC PLATES OF WORLD POLITICS WERE SHIFTING
JosephNye_2010G@417.17:424.90 AND PRESIDENT MEDVEDEV OF RUSSIA FOR EXAMPLE PRONOUNCED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF UNITED STATES POWER
JosephNye_2010G@425.52:434.40 BUT IN FACT THIS METAPHOR OF DECLINE IS OFTEN VERY MISLEADING IF YOU LOOK AT HISTORY IN RECENT HISTORY
JosephNye_2010G@460.90:469.50 THE RUST BELT ECONOMY OF THE MIDWEST TO THE SILICON VALLEY ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA THAT WAS THE END OF AMERICA BUT IN FACT
JosephNye_2010G@470.01:480.17 WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS NONE OF THOSE WERE TRUE INDEED PEOPLE WERE OVER ENTHUSIASTIC IN THE EARLY TWENTY HUNDREDS THINKING AMERICA COULD DO ANYTHING
JosephNye_2010G@480.54:492.82 WHICH LED US INTO SOME DISASTROUS FOREIGN POLICY ADVENTURES AND NOW WE'RE BACK TO DECLINE AGAIN THE MORAL OF THIS STORY IS ALL THESE NARRATIVES ABOUT RISE AND FALL AND DECLINE TELL US A LOT MORE
JosephNye_2010G@494.52:503.22 THEY DO ABOUT REALITY IF WE TRY TO FOCUS ON THE REALITY THEN WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON IS WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING
JosephNye_2010G@503.69:506.69 IN TERMS OF CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES
JosephNye_2010G@518.88:525.09 SO WE'VE GOT WHAT SEVENTEEN MORE YEARS TO GO OR SO BEFORE CHINA 'S BIGGER NOW SOMEDAY
JosephNye_2010G@525.44:533.08 WITH A BILLION POINT THREE PEOPLE GETTING RICHER THEY ARE GOING TO BE BIGGER THAN THE UNITED STATES BUT BE VERY CAREFUL OF THESE PROJECTIONS
JosephNye_2010G@533.36:540.47 SUCH AS THE GOLDMAN SACHS PROJECTION AS THOUGH THAT GIVES YOU AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF POWER TRANSITION IN THIS CENTURY
JosephNye_2010G@571.88:576.46 TELL YOU ABOUT THE COMPOSITION OF THE ECONOMY CHINA STILL HAS LARGE AREAS
JosephNye_2010G@578.21:587.75 AND PER CAPITA INCOME IS A BETTER MEASURE OF THE SOPHISTICATION OF THE ECONOMY AND THAT THE CHINESE WON 'T CATCH UP OR PASS THE AMERICANS UNTIL SOMEWHERE IN THE LATTER PART
JosephNye_2010G@619.28:621.38 IF YOU'RE SITTING IN JAPAN
JosephNye_2010G@621.88:623.20 OR IN NEW DELHI
JosephNye_2010G@623.78:625.10 OR IN HANOI
JosephNye_2010G@625.99:638.92 YOUR VIEW OF THE RISE OF CHINA IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN IF YOU'RE SITTING IN BEIJING INDEED ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES THAT THE AMERICANS WILL HAVE IN TERMS OF POWER IN ASIA IS ALL THOSE COUNTRIES
JosephNye_2010G@639.35:650.23 WANT AN AMERICAN INSURANCE POLICY AGAINST THE RISE OF CHINA IT'S AS THOUGH MEXICO AND CANADA WERE HOSTILE NEIGHBORS TO THE UNITED STATES WHICH THEY'RE NOT
JosephNye_2010G@651.07:657.82 SO THESE SIMPLE PROJECTIONS OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS TYPE ARE NOT TELLING US WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT POWER TRANSITION
JosephNye_2010G@658.82:666.70 BUT YOU MIGHT ASK WELL SO WHAT IN ANY CASE WHY DOES IT MATTER WHO CARES IS THIS JUST A GAME THAT DIPLOMATS AND ACADEMICS PLAY
JosephNye_2010G@667.05:679.47 THE ANSWER IS IT MATTERS QUITE A LOT BECAUSE IF YOU BELIEVE IN DECLINE AND YOU GET THE ANSWERS WRONG ON THIS THE FACTS NOT THE MYTHS YOU MAY HAVE POLICIES WHICH ARE VERY DANGEROUS
JosephNye_2010G@691.71:693.98 TWO AND A HALF MILLENNIA AGO
JosephNye_2010G@694.76:705.32 WHAT CAUSED IT THUCYDIDES THE GREAT HISTORIAN OF THE THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR SAID IT WAS THE RISE IN THE POWER OF ATHENS AND THE FEAR IT CREATED IN SPARTA
JosephNye_2010G@716.33:725.66 WORLD WAR ONE THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION IN WHICH THE EUROPEAN STATE SYSTEM TORE ITSELF APART AND DESTROYED ITS CENTRALITY IN THE WORLD
JosephNye_2010G@726.08:732.24 THAT THAT WAS CAUSED BY THE RISE IN THE POWER OF GERMANY AND THE FEAR THAT IT CREATED IN BRITAIN
JosephNye_2010G@732.67:742.41 SO THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE TELLING US THIS IS GOING TO BE REPRODUCED TODAY THAT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IS THE SAME THING NOW IN THIS CENTURY NO
JosephNye_2010G@754.49:761.18 BUT ALSO IF YOU HAVE THIS BELIEF AND IT CREATES A SENSE OF FEAR IT LEADS TO OVERREACTION
JosephNye_2010G@761.99:773.32 AND THE GREATEST DANGER WE HAVE OF MANAGING THIS POWER TRANSITION OF THE SHIFT TOWARD THE EAST IS FEAR TO PARAPHRASE FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT FROM A DIFFERENT CONTEXT
JosephNye_2010G@773.64:781.63 THE GREATEST THING WE HAVE TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF WE DON'T HAVE TO FEAR THE RISE OF CHINA OR THE RETURN OF ASIA
JosephNye_2010G@782.19:790.86 AND IF WE HAVE POLICIES IN WHICH WE TAKE IT IN THAT LARGER HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THIS PROCESS
JosephNye_2010G@791.84:800.33 LET ME SAY A WORD NOW ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF POWER AND HOW IT RELATES TO POWER DIFFUSION AND THEN PULL THESE TWO TYPES TOGETHER
JosephNye_2010G@800.74:808.66 IF YOU ASK HOW IS POWER DISTRIBUTED IN THE WORLD TODAY IT'S DISTRIBUTED MUCH LIKE A THREE DIMENSIONAL CHESS GAME
JosephNye_2010G@809.68:810.58 TOP BOARD
JosephNye_2010G@827.18:838.78 ECONOMIC POWER AMONG STATES POWER IS MULTI POLAR THERE ARE BALANCERS THE U S EUROPE CHINA JAPAN CAN BALANCE EACH OTHER
JosephNye_2010G@839.04:847.73 THE BOTTOM BOARD OF THIS THREE DIMENSIONAL THE BOARD OF TRANSNATIONAL RELATIONS THINGS THAT CROSS BORDERS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF GOVERNMENTS
JosephNye_2010G@848.49:858.90 THINGS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE DRUG TRADE FINANCIAL FLOWS PANDEMICS ALL THESE THINGS THAT CROSS BORDERS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF GOVERNMENTS
JosephNye_2010G@859.65:867.52 THERE NOBODY 'S IN CHARGE IT MAKES NO SENSE TO CALL THIS UNIPOLAR OR MULTI POLAR POWER IS CHAOTICALLY DISTRIBUTED
JosephNye_2010G@867.80:876.90 AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS AND THIS IS WHERE MANY GREATEST CHALLENGES ARE COMING IN THIS CENTURY IS THROUGH COOPERATION THROUGH WORKING TOGETHER
JosephNye_2010G@877.38:886.93 WHICH MEANS THAT SOFT POWER BECOMES MORE IMPORTANT THAT ABILITY TO ORGANIZE NETWORKS TO DEAL WITH THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS AND TO BE ABLE TO GET COOPERATION
JosephNye_2010G@896.59:904.83 MY GAIN IS YOUR LOSS AND VICE VERSA POWER CAN ALSO BE POSITIVE SUM WHERE YOUR GAIN CAN BE MY GAIN
JosephNye_2010G@905.35:912.99 IF CHINA DEVELOPS GREATER ENERGY SECURITY AND GREATER CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH ITS PROBLEMS OF CARBON EMISSIONS
JosephNye_2010G@913.35:925.58 THAT'S GOOD FOR US AS WELL AS GOOD FOR CHINA AS WELL AS GOOD FOR EVERYBODY ELSE SO EMPOWERING CHINA TO DEAL WITH ITS OWN PROBLEMS OF CARBON IS GOOD FOR EVERYBODY
JosephNye_2010G@926.68:934.94 NOT A ZERO SUM I WIN YOU LOSE IT'S ONE IN WHICH WE CAN ALL GAIN SO AS WE THINK ABOUT POWER IN THIS CENTURY
JosephNye_2010G@935.61:947.57 WE WANT TO GET AWAY FROM THIS VIEW THAT IT'S ALL I WIN YOU LOSE NOW I DON'T MEAN TO BE POLLYANNAISH ABOUT THIS WARS PERSIST POWER PERSISTS MILITARY POWER IS IMPORTANT
JosephNye_2010G@948.21:955.00 KEEPING BALANCES IS IMPORTANT ALL THIS IS STILL PERSISTS HARD POWER IS THERE AND IT WILL REMAIN
JosephNye_2010G@955.47:965.81 BUT UNLESS YOU LEARN HOW TO MIX HARD POWER WITH SOFT POWER INTO STRATEGIES THAT I CALL SMART POWER YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH THE NEW KINDS OF PROBLEMS THAT
JosephNye_2010G@967.36:976.81 SO THE KEY QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT AS WE LOOK AT THIS IS HOW DO WE WORK TOGETHER TO PRODUCE GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS THINGS FROM WHICH ALL
JosephNye_2010G@976.99:983.60 OF US CAN BENEFIT HOW DO WE DEFINE OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST ZERO SUM BUT POSITIVE
JosephNye_2010G@984.58:992.03 IN THAT SENSE IF WE DEFINE OUR INTERESTS FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE UNITED STATES THE WAY BRITAIN DEFINED ITS INTERESTS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
JosephNye_2010G@992.25:1000.80 KEEPING AN OPEN TRADING SYSTEM KEEPING A MONETARY STABILITY KEEPING FREEDOM OF THE SEAS THOSE WERE GOOD FOR BRITAIN THEY WERE GOOD FOR OTHERS AS WELL
JosephNye_2010G@1021.34:1034.38 IN WHICH WHILE PROTECTING OURSELVES WITH HARD POWER WE CAN ORGANIZE WITH OTHERS IN NETORKS TO PRODUCE NOT ONLY PUBLIC GOODS BUT WAYS THAT WILL ENHANCE OUR SOFT POWER SO
JosephNye_2010G@1034.84:1041.53 IF ONE LOOKS AT THE STATEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT THIS I AM IMPRESSED THAT WHEN HILLARY CLINTON DESCRIBED
JosephNye_2010G@1041.89:1050.51 THE FOREIGN POLICY OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SHE SAID THAT THE FOREIGN POLICY OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS GOING TO BE SMART POWER
JosephNye_2010G@1050.93:1060.23 AS SHE PUT IT USING ALL THE TOOLS IN OUR FOREIGN POLICY TOOL BOX AND IF WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THESE TWO GREAT POWER SHIFTS THAT I'VE
JosephNye_2010G@1061.46:1069.59 THE POWER SHIFT REPRESENTED BY TRANSITION AMONG STATES THE POWER SHIFT REPRESENTED BY DIFFUSION OF POWER AWAY FROM ALL STATES
