JeffreySkoll_2007 I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WAITING BY THE PHONE FOR A CALL FROM TED FOR YEARS
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND IN FACT IN TWO THOUSAND I WAS READY TO TALK ABOUT EBAY BUT NO CALL
JeffreySkoll_2007 IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE I WAS READY TO DO A TALK ABOUT THE SKOLL FOUNDATION AND SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP
JeffreySkoll_2007 IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR I STARTED PARTICIPANT PRODUCTIONS AND WE HAD A REALLY GOOD FIRST YEAR AND NO CALL
JeffreySkoll_2007 YOU'VE GOT A CRUEL SENSE OF HUMOR TED
JeffreySkoll_2007 WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO HOLLYWOOD FROM SILICON VALLEY I HAD SOME MISGIVINGS BUT I FOUND THAT THERE WERE SOME ADVANTAGES TO BEING IN HOLLYWOOD
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND IN FACT SOME ADVANTAGES TO OWNING YOUR OWN MEDIA COMPANY
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND I ALSO FOUND THAT HOLLYWOOD AND SILICON VALLEY HAVE A LOT MORE IN COMMON THAN I WOULD HAVE DREAMED HOLLYWOOD HAS ITS SEX SYMBOLS
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND THE VALLEY HAS ITS SEX SYMBOLS
JeffreySkoll_2007 THAN I THAN I WOULD HAVE
JeffreySkoll_2007 BUT I'M ACTUALLY HERE TODAY TO TELL A STORY
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND PART OF IT IS A PERSONAL STORY WHEN CHRIS INVITED ME TO SPEAK HE SAID PEOPLE THINK OF YOU AS A A BIT OF AN ENIGMA AND THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT DRIVES YOU
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND WHAT REALLY DRIVES ME IS IS A VISION OF THE FUTURE THAT I THINK WE ALL SHARE IT'S A WORLD OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY AND SUSTAINABILITY
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND WHEN WE WHEN WE HEARD A LOT OF THE PRESENTATIONS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS ED WILSON AND
JeffreySkoll_2007 THE PICTURES OF JAMES NACHTWEY I THINK WE ALL REALIZED HOW FAR WE HAVE TO GO TO GET TO THIS NEW VERSION OF HUMANITY THAT I LIKE TO CALL HUMANITY TWO POINT
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT RESIDES IN EACH OF US TO CLOSE WHAT I THINK ARE THE ARE THE TWO
JeffreySkoll_2007 BIG CALAMITIES IN THE WORLD TODAY ONE IS THE GAP IN OPPORTUNITY THIS GAP THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON LAST NIGHT CALLED
JeffreySkoll_2007 UNFAIR AND UNSUSTAINABLE AND OUT OF THAT COMES POVERTY AND ILLITERACY AND DISEASE AND ALL THESE EVILS THAT WE SEE AROUND US
JeffreySkoll_2007 BUT PERHAPS THE OTHER BIGGER GAP IS WHAT WE CALL THE HOPE GAP AND SOMEONE AT SOME POINT CAME UP WITH THIS VERY BAD IDEA THAT AN ORDINARY INDIVIDUAL COULDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD AND I THINK THAT'S JUST A HORRIBLE THING
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND SO CHAPTER ONE REALLY BEGINS TODAY WITH ALL OF US BECAUSE WITHIN EACH OF US IS THE POWER TO
JeffreySkoll_2007 EQUAL THOSE OPPORTUNITY GAPS AND TO CLOSE THE HOPE GAPS AND IF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF TED CAN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD I DON'T KNOW WHO CAN
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND FOR ME A LOT OF THIS STARTED WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND MY FAMILY USED TO GO CAMPING IN UPSTATE NEW YORK AND THERE REALLY WASN'T MUCH TO DO THERE FOR THE SUMMER EXCEPT GET BEATEN UP BY MY SISTER OR READ BOOKS
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND SO I USED TO READ AUTHORS LIKE JAMES MICHENER AND JAMES CLAVELL AND AYN RAND AND THEIR STORIES MADE THE WORLD SEEM A VERY SMALL AND INTERCONNECTED PLACE
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND IT STRUCK ME THAT IF I COULD WRITE STORIES THAT WERE ABOUT THIS WORLD AS BEING SMALL AND INTERCONNECTED THAT MAYBE I COULD GET PEOPLE INTERESTED IN THE ISSUES THAT AFFECTED US ALL AND MAYBE ENGAGE THEM TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
JeffreySkoll_2007 I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS NECESSARILY THE BEST WAY TO MAKE A LIVING SO I DECIDED TO GO ON A PATH TO BECOME FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT SO I COULD WRITE THESE STORIES AS QUICKLY AS I COULD
JeffreySkoll_2007 I THEN HAD A BIT OF A WAKE UP CALL WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN AND MY DAD CAME HOME ONE DAY AND ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD CANCER AND IT LOOKED PRETTY BAD AND WHAT HE SAID WAS
JeffreySkoll_2007 HE WASN'T SO MUCH AFRAID THAT HE MIGHT DIE BUT THAT HE HADN'T DONE THE THINGS THAT HE WANTED TO WITH HIS LIFE
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND KNOCK ON WOOD HE 'S STILL ALIVE TODAY MANY YEARS LATER BUT FOR A YOUNG MAN THAT MADE A REAL IMPRESSION ON ME THAT ONE NEVER KNOWS HOW MUCH TIME ONE REALLY HAS SO I SET OUT IN A HURRY
JeffreySkoll_2007 I STUDIED ENGINEERING I STARTED A COUPLE OF BUSINESSES THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE THE TICKET TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM ONE OF THOSE BUSINESSES WAS A COMPUTER RENTAL BUSINESS CALLED MICROS ON THE MOVE WHICH IS VERY WELL NAMED BECAUSE PEOPLE KEPT STEALING THE COMPUTERS
JeffreySkoll_2007 SO I FIGURED
JeffreySkoll_2007 I NEEDED TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT BUSINESS SO I WENT TO STANFORD BUSINESS SCHOOL AND STUDIED THERE AND WHILE I WAS THERE I MADE FRIENDS WITH A FELLOW NAMED PIERRE OMIDYAR WHO IS HERE TODAY AND PIERRE I APOLOGIZE FOR THIS THIS IS A PHOTO FROM THE OLD DAYS
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND JUST AFTER I'D GRADUATED PIERRE CAME TO ME AND WITH THIS IDEA TO HELP PEOPLE BUY AND SELL THINGS ONLINE WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE WISDOM OF MY STANFORD DEGREE I SAID PIERRE WHAT A STUPID IDEA
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS RIGHT BUT RIGHT AFTER THAT
JeffreySkoll_2007 IN NINETY SIX PIERRE AND I LEFT OUR FULL TIME JOBS TO BUILD EBAY AS A COMPANY AND THE REST OF THAT STORY YOU KNOW THE COMPANY WENT PUBLIC TWO YEARS LATER AND
JeffreySkoll_2007 TODAY ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN COMPANIES IN THE WORLD HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE USE IT IN HUNDREDS OF COUNTRIES AND SO ON
JeffreySkoll_2007 BUT FOR ME PERSONALLY IT WAS A REAL CHANGE I WENT FROM LIVING IN A HOUSE WITH FIVE GUYS IN PALO ALTO AND LIVING OFF THEIR LEFTOVERS
JeffreySkoll_2007 TO ALL OF A SUDDEN HAVING ALL KINDS OF RESOURCES AND I WANTED TO FIGURE OUT HOW I COULD TAKE THE BLESSING OF THESE RESOURCES AND SHARE IT WITH THE WORLD
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND AROUND THAT TIME I MET JOHN GARDNER WHO IS A REMARKABLE MAN HE WAS THE ARCHITECT OF THE GREAT SOCIETY PROGRAMS UNDER LYNDON JOHNSON IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND I ASKED HIM WHAT HE FELT WAS THE BEST THING I COULD DO OR ANYONE COULD DO TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LONG TERM ISSUES FACING HUMANITY AND JOHN SAID
JeffreySkoll_2007 BET ON GOOD PEOPLE DOING GOOD THINGS BET ON GOOD PEOPLE DOING GOOD THINGS AND THAT REALLY RESONATED WITH ME I STARTED A FOUNDATION
JeffreySkoll_2007 TO BET ON THESE GOOD PEOPLE DOING GOOD THINGS THESE LEADING INNOVATIVE NONPROFIT FOLKS WHO ARE USING BUSINESS SKILLS IN A VERY LEVERAGED WAY TO SOLVE SOCIAL PROBLEMS PEOPLE TODAY WE CALL SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURS
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND TO PUT A FACE ON IT PEOPLE LIKE MOHAMMED YUNUS WHO STARTED THE GRAMEEN BANK HAS LIFTED ONE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE PLUS OUT OF POVERTY AROUND THE WORLD
JeffreySkoll_2007 THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW FOLKS LIKE ANN COTTON WHO STARTED A GROUP CALLED CAMFED IN AFRICA
JeffreySkoll_2007 BECAUSE SHE FELT GIRLS EDUCATION WAS LAGGING AND SHE STARTED IT ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO AND TODAY SHE EDUCATES OVER A QUARTER OF A MILLION AFRICAN GIRLS
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND SOMEBODY LIKE DOCTOR VICTORIA HALE WHO STARTED THE WORLD 'S FIRST NONPROFIT PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY AND WHOSE FIRST
JeffreySkoll_2007 WILL BE FIGHTING VISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS ALSO KNOWN AS BLACK FEVER AND BY TWO THOUSAND AND TEN SHE HOPES TO ELIMINATE THIS DISEASE WHICH IS REALLY A SCOURGE IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND SO THIS THIS IS ONE WAY TO BET ON GOOD PEOPLE DOING GOOD THINGS AND A LOT OF THIS COMES TOGETHER IN A PHILOSOPHY OF CHANGE THAT I FIND REALLY IS POWERFUL
JeffreySkoll_2007 IT'S WHAT WE CALL INVEST CONNECT AND CELEBRATE AND INVEST IF YOU SEE GOOD PEOPLE DOING GOOD THINGS INVEST IN THEM INVEST IN THEIR ORGANIZATIONS OR IN BUSINESS INVEST IN THESE FOLKS
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND CELEBRATE THEM TELL THEIR STORIES BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE THERE GOOD PEOPLE DOING GOOD WORK BUT THEIR STORIES CAN HELP CLOSE THESE GAPS OF HOPE
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND IT WAS THIS LAST PART OF THE MISSION THE CELEBRATE PART THAT REALLY GOT ME BACK TO THINKING WHEN I WAS A KID AND WANTED TO TELL STORIES TO GET PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE ISSUES THAT AFFECT US ALL
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND A LIGHT BULB WENT OFF WHICH WAS FIRST THAT I DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO THE WRITING MYSELF I COULD FIND WRITERS AND THEN THE NEXT LIGHT BULB WAS BETTER THAN JUST WRITING WHAT ABOUT FILM AND TV TO GET OUT TO PEOPLE IN A BIG WAY
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND I THOUGHT ABOUT THE FILMS THAT INSPIRED ME FILMS LIKE GANDHI AND SCHINDLER 'S LIST AND I WONDERED WHO WAS DOING THESE KIND OF FILMS TODAY AND THERE REALLY WASN'T A SPECIFIC COMPANY THAT WAS FOCUSED ON THE PUBLIC INTEREST
JeffreySkoll_2007 SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE I STARTED TO MAKE MY WAY AROUND LOS ANGELES TO TALK ABOUT THE IDEA OF A PRO SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND I WAS MET WITH A LOT OF ENCOURAGEMENT
JeffreySkoll_2007 ONE OF THE LINES OF ENCOURAGEMENT THAT I HEARD OVER AND OVER WAS THE STREETS OF HOLLYWOOD ARE LITTERED WITH CARCASSES OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU
JeffreySkoll_2007 WHO THINK YOU'RE GOING TO COME TO THIS TOWN AND MAKE MOVIES AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THE OTHER ADAGE THE SUREST WAY TO BECOME A MILLIONAIRE IS TO START BY BEING A BILLIONAIRE AND GO INTO THE MOVIE BUSINESS
JeffreySkoll_2007 UNDETERRED IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR I STARTED PARTICIPANT PRODUCTIONS WITH THE VISION TO BE A GLOBAL MEDIA COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE PUBLIC INTEREST
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND OUR MISSION IS TO PRODUCE ENTERTAINMENT THAT CREATES AND INSPIRES SOCIAL CHANGE AND WE DON'T JUST WANT PEOPLE TO SEE OUR MOVIES AND SAY THAT WAS FUN AND FORGET ABOUT IT WE WANT THEM TO ACTUALLY GET INVOLVED IN THE ISSUES
JeffreySkoll_2007 IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE WE LAUNCHED OUR OUR FIRST SLATE OF FILMS MURDER BALL NORTH COUNTRY SYRIANA AND GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND MUCH TO MY SURPRISE THEY WERE NOTICED WE ENDED UP WITH ELEVEN OSCAR NOMINATIONS FOR THESE FILMS AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A PRETTY GOOD YEAR FOR THIS GUY
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND WE HAD AN ONLINE COMPONENT OF THAT OUR COMMUNITY SECT CALLED PARTICIPATE NET BUT WITH OUR SOCIAL SECTOR PARTNERS LIKE THE ACLU AND PBS AND THE SIERRA CLUB AND THE NRDC ONCE PEOPLE SAW THE FILM THERE WAS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THEY COULD DO TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
JeffreySkoll_2007 ONE OF THESE FILMS IN PARTICULAR
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND WE RELEASED THE FILM AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE CONGRESS WAS DEBATING THE RENEWAL OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND WITH SCREENINGS ON THE HILL AND DISCUSSIONS AND WITH OUR SOCIAL SECTOR PARTNERS LIKE THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF WOMEN
JeffreySkoll_2007 THE FILM WAS WIDELY CREDITED WITH INFLUENCING THE SUCCESSFUL RENEWAL OF THE ACT
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND THAT TO ME SPOKE VOLUMES BECAUSE IT'S THE THE FILM STARTED ABOUT A TRUE LIFE STORY ABOUT A WOMAN WHO WAS HARASSED SUED HER EMPLOYER
JeffreySkoll_2007 LED TO A LANDMARK CASE THAT LED TO THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY ACT AND THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND OTHERS AND THEN THE MOVIE ABOUT THIS PERSON DOING THESE THINGS
JeffreySkoll_2007 THEN LED TO THIS GREATER RENEWAL AND SO AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO BETTING ON GOOD PEOPLE DOING GOOD THINGS
JeffreySkoll_2007 SPEAKING OF WHICH OUR FELLOW TEDSTER AL I FIRST SAW AL DO HIS SLIDE SHOW PRESENTATION ON GLOBAL WARMING IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE
JeffreySkoll_2007 AT THAT POINT I THOUGHT I KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING I THOUGHT IT WAS A THIRTY TO FIFTY YEAR PROBLEM AND AFTER WE SAW HIS SLIDE SHOW IT BECAME CLEAR THAT IT WAS MUCH MORE URGENT
JeffreySkoll_2007 HAVING AL GO AROUND THE WORLD SPEAKING TO AUDIENCES OF ONE HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED AT A TIME AND YOU KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER ADAGE IN HOLLYWOOD THAT NOBODY KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ANYTHING
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND I REALLY THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A STRAIGHT TO PBS CHARITABLE INITIATIVE AND SO IT WAS A GREAT SHOCK TO ALL OF US WHEN THE FILM REALLY CAPTURED THE PUBLIC INTEREST
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND TODAY IS MANDATORY VIEWING IN SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND AND MOST OF SCANDINAVIA WE'VE SENT FIFTY THOUSAND DVDS TO
JeffreySkoll_2007 HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS IN THE US AND IT'S REALLY CHANGED THE DEBATE ON GLOBAL WARMING
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND FOR PARTICIPANT THIS IS JUST THE START EVERYTHING WE DO LOOKS AT THE MAJOR ISSUES IN THE WORLD AND WE HAVE TEN FILMS IN PRODUCTION RIGHT NOW AND DOZENS OTHERS IN DEVELOPMENT
JeffreySkoll_2007 QUICKLY TALK ABOUT A FEW COMING UP ONE IS CHARLIE WILSON 'S WAR WITH TOM HANKS AND JULIA ROBERTS AND IT'S THE TRUE STORY OF CONGRESSMAN CHARLIE WILSON AND HOW HE FUNDED THE TALIBAN TO FIGHT THE RUSSIANS IN AFGHANISTAN
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND WE'RE ALSO DOING A MOVIE CALLED THE KITE RUNNER BASED ON THE BOOK THE KITE RUNNER
JeffreySkoll_2007 ABOUT AFGHANISTAN AND WE THINK ONCE PEOPLE SEE THESE FILMS THEY'LL HAVE A MUCH BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PART OF THE WORLD AND THE MIDDLE EAST IN GENERAL
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND AGAIN A STORY ABOUT A SMALL GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO DID MAKE CHANGE IN THE WORLD
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND A DOCUMENTARY THAT WE'RE DOING ON JIMMY CARTER AND HIS MID EAST PEACE EFFORTS OVER THE YEARS AND IN PARTICULAR WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING HIM ON HIS RECENT BOOK TOUR WHICH AS MANY OF YOU KNOW HAS BEEN VERY NON CONTROVERSIAL
JeffreySkoll_2007 WHICH IS REALLY BAD FOR GETTING PEOPLE TO COME SEE A MOVIE
JeffreySkoll_2007 IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT EVERYBODY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CHANGE IN THEIR OWN WAY
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM HAVE DONE SO THROUGH THEIR BUSINESS LIVES OR THEIR PHILANTHROPIC WORK OR THEIR OTHER
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND ONE THING THAT I'VE LEARNED IS THAT THERE'S NEVER ONE RIGHT WAY TO MAKE CHANGE ONE CAN DO IT AS A TECH PERSON OR AS A FINANCE PERSON OR A NONPROFIT PERSON OR AS AN ENTERTAINMENT PERSON BUT EVERY ONE OF US IS ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND MORE
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND I BELIEVE IF WE DO THESE THINGS WE CAN CLOSE THE OPPORTUNITY GAPS WE CAN CLOSE THE HOPE GAPS AND I CAN IMAGINE IF WE DO THIS THE HEADLINES IN TEN YEARS MIGHT READ SOMETHING LIKE
JeffreySkoll_2007 NEW AIDS CASES IN AFRICA FALL TO ZERO
JeffreySkoll_2007 US IMPORTS ITS LAST BARREL OF OIL
JeffreySkoll_2007 THIS ONE SNOW HAS RETURNED TO KILIMANJARO
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND FINALLY AN EBAY LISTING FOR ONE
JeffreySkoll_2007 WELL TRAVELED SLIDE SHOW NOW OBSOLETE MUSEUM PIECE
JeffreySkoll_2007 AND I BELIEVE THAT
