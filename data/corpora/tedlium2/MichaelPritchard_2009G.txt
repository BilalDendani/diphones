MichaelPritchard_2009G@26.50:34.96 THE WATER THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED FOR YOU HERE AT THE CONFERENCE OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND I'M SURE YOU'LL FEEL THAT IT'S FROM A SAFE SOURCE BUT WHAT IF IT
MichaelPritchard_2009G@36.62:46.57 WHAT IF IT WAS FROM A SOURCE LIKE THIS THEN STATISTICS WOULD ACTUALLY SAY THAT HALF OF YOU WOULD NOW BE SUFFERING WITH DIARRHEA
MichaelPritchard_2009G@49.59:61.29 TALKED A LOT IN THE PAST ABOUT STATISTICS AND THE PROVISION OF SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR ALL BUT THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO GET THROUGH AND I THINK I'VE WORKED OUT WHY
MichaelPritchard_2009G@62.37:73.90 BECAUSE USING CURRENT THINKING THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM JUST SEEMS TOO HUGE TO CONTEMPLATE SOLVING SO WE JUST SWITCH OFF US
MichaelPritchard_2009G@75.36:77.68 AND AID AGENCIES
MichaelPritchard_2009G@77.93:84.96 WELL TODAY I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU THAT THROUGH THINKING DIFFERENTLY THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN SOLVED
MichaelPritchard_2009G@86.12:93.11 BY THE WAY SINCE I'VE BEEN SPEAKING ANOTHER THIRTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ARE SUFFERING NOW WITH DIARRHEA
MichaelPritchard_2009G@94.08:98.93 AND FOUR CHILDREN HAVE JUST DIED
MichaelPritchard_2009G@99.21:107.71 I INVENTED LIFESAVER BOTTLE BECAUSE I GOT ANGRY I LIKE MOST OF YOU WAS SITTING DOWN THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR
MichaelPritchard_2009G@108.13:120.69 I WAS WATCHING THE DEVASTATING NEWS OF THE ASIAN TSUNAMI AS IT ROLLED IN PLAYING OUT ON TV THE DAYS AND WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED PEOPLE FLEEING TO THE HILLS BEING FORCED TO DRINK CONTAMINATED WATER
MichaelPritchard_2009G@121.83:127.60 FACE DEATH THAT REALLY STUCK WITH ME THEN
MichaelPritchard_2009G@127.80:135.88 A FEW MONTHS LATER HURRICANE KATRINA SLAMMED INTO THE SIDE OF AMERICA OKAY I THOUGHT HERE 'S A FIRST WORLD COUNTRY
MichaelPritchard_2009G@136.24:143.29 LET 'S SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO DAY ONE NOTHING DAY TWO NOTHING
MichaelPritchard_2009G@143.96:153.79 YOU KNOW IT TOOK FIVE DAYS TO GET WATER TO THE SUPERDOME PEOPLE WERE SHOOTING EACH OTHER ON THE STREETS FOR TV SETS AND WATER
MichaelPritchard_2009G@166.30:166.98 HOWEVER
MichaelPritchard_2009G@167.68:181.90 AFTER A FEW FAILED PROTOTYPES I FINALLY CAME UP WITH THIS THE LIFESAVER BOTTLE OKAY NOW FOR THE SCIENCE BIT BEFORE LIFESAVER THE BEST HAND FILTERS WERE ONLY CAPABLE OF FILTERING DOWN TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED NANOMETERS
MichaelPritchard_2009G@182.43:189.81 THE SMALLEST BACTERIA IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED NANOMETERS SO A TWO HUNDRED NANOMETER BACTERIA IS GOING TO GET THROUGH
MichaelPritchard_2009G@189.99:197.12 A TWO HUNDRED NANOMETER HOLE THE SMALLEST VIRUS ON THE OTHER HAND IS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE NANOMETERS
MichaelPritchard_2009G@208.38:210.76 GETTING THROUGH
MichaelPritchard_2009G@210.96:219.73 OKAY I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A BIT OF A DEMONSTRATION WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THAT I SPENT ALL THE TIME SETTING THIS UP SO I GUESS I SHOULD WE'RE IN THE FINE CITY OF OXFORD SO
MichaelPritchard_2009G@229.35:240.07 BUT I GOT TO THINKING YOU KNOW IF WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FLOOD ZONE IN BANGLADESH THE WATER WOULDN'T LOOK LIKE THIS SO I'VE GONE AND GOT SOME STUFF TO ADD INTO IT AND THIS IS FROM MY POND
MichaelPritchard_2009G@241.86:245.92 HAVE A SMELL OF THAT MISTER CAMERAMAN
MichaelPritchard_2009G@248.74:259.96 RIGHT WE'RE JUST GOING TO POUR THAT IN THERE UGH MICHAEL PRITCHARD OKAY WE'VE GOT SOME RUNOFF FROM A SEWAGE PLANT FARM SO
MichaelPritchard_2009G@261.27:261.95 PUT THAT IN
MichaelPritchard_2009G@263.61:265.83 PUT THAT IN THERE THERE WE GO AND
MichaelPritchard_2009G@267.69:275.76 SOME OTHER BITS AND PIECES CHUCK THAT IN THERE AND I'VE GOT A GIFT HERE FROM A FRIEND OF MINE 'S RABBIT SO WE'RE JUST
MichaelPritchard_2009G@277.76:284.20 PUT THAT IN THERE AS WELL OKAY NOW
MichaelPritchard_2009G@284.52:287.42 THE LIFESAVER BOTTLE WORKS REALLY SIMPLY
MichaelPritchard_2009G@289.04:295.39 YOU JUST SCOOP THE WATER UP TODAY I'M GOING TO USE A JUG JUST TO SHOW YOU ALL LET 'S GET A BIT OF THAT
MichaelPritchard_2009G@304.06:304.63 OKAY
MichaelPritchard_2009G@313.68:314.24 OKAY
MichaelPritchard_2009G@319.45:319.77 THE
MichaelPritchard_2009G@373.63:373.96 OKAY
MichaelPritchard_2009G@380.77:390.43 AND WHEN IT'S EXPIRED USING FAILSAFE TECHNOLOGY THE SYSTEM WILL SHUT OFF PROTECTING THE USER POP THE CARTRIDGE OUT POP A NEW ONE IN IT'S GOOD FOR ANOTHER SIX THOUSAND LITERS
MichaelPritchard_2009G@392.52:397.82 SO LET 'S LOOK AT THE APPLICATIONS TRADITIONALLY IN A CRISIS WHAT DO WE DO WE SHIP WATER
MichaelPritchard_2009G@399.09:406.61 THEN AFTER A FEW WEEKS WE SET UP CAMPS AND PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO COME INTO THE CAMPS TO GET THEIR SAFE DRINKING WATER
MichaelPritchard_2009G@407.67:419.13 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE CONGREGATE IN A CAMP DISEASES SPREAD MORE RESOURCES ARE REQUIRED THE PROBLEM JUST BECOMES SELF PERPETUATING
MichaelPritchard_2009G@419.66:432.39 BUT BY THINKING DIFFERENTLY AND SHIPPING THESE PEOPLE CAN STAY PUT THEY CAN MAKE THEIR OWN STERILE DRINKING WATER AND START TO GET ON WITH REBUILDING THEIR HOMES AND THEIR LIVES
MichaelPritchard_2009G@433.40:440.00 NOW IT DOESN'T REQUIRE A NATURAL DISASTER FOR THIS TO WORK USING
MichaelPritchard_2009G@440.48:448.76 THE OLD THINKING OF NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND PIPE WORK IS TOO EXPENSIVE WHEN YOU RUN THE NUMBERS ON A CALCULATOR YOU RUN OUT
MichaelPritchard_2009G@450.27:454.36 SO HERE IS THE THINKING DIFFERENT BIT INSTEAD OF
MichaelPritchard_2009G@468.14:476.77 THERE AND DUMPS IT ONTO THE MOUNTAINS RIVERS AND STREAMS AND WHERE DO PEOPLE LIVE NEAR WATER ALL WE'VE GO TO DO IS MAKE IT STERILE
MichaelPritchard_2009G@477.42:489.96 HOW DO WE DO THAT WELL WE COULD USE THE LIFESAVER BOTTLE OR WE COULD USE ONE OF THESE THE SAME TECHNOLOGY IN A JERRYCAN THIS WILL PROCESS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND LITERS OF WATER
MichaelPritchard_2009G@490.85:499.63 THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR FOR THREE YEARS AND HOW MUCH DOES IT COST ABOUT HALF
MichaelPritchard_2009G@506.82:512.50 SO BY THINKING DIFFERENTLY AND PROCESSING WATER AT THE POINT OF USE MOTHERS AND CHILDREN
MichaelPritchard_2009G@512.84:520.22 NO LONGER HAVE TO WALK FOUR HOURS A DAY TO COLLECT THEIR WATER THEY CAN GET IT FROM A SOURCE NEARBY
MichaelPritchard_2009G@521.26:531.79 SO WITH JUST EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WE CAN HIT THE MILLENNIUM GOAL 'S TARGET OF HALVING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITHOUT ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER
MichaelPritchard_2009G@532.39:540.38 TO PUT THAT INTO CONTEXT THE U K GOVERNMENT SPENDS ABOUT TWELVE BILLION POUNDS A YEAR ON FOREIGN AID
MichaelPritchard_2009G@541.43:549.03 BUT WHY STOP THERE WITH TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS EVERYONE CAN HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER
MichaelPritchard_2009G@550.65:558.90 SO THE THREE AND A HALF BILLION PEOPLE THAT SUFFER EVERY YEAR AS A RESULT AND THE TWO MILLION KIDS THAT DIE EVERY YEAR
