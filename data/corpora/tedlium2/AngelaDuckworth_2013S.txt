AngelaDuckworth_2013S I
AngelaDuckworth_2013S SEVEN YEARS OLD I LEFT A VERY DEMANDING JOB IN MANAGEMENT CONSULTING FOR A JOB THAT WAS EVEN MORE DEMANDING TEACHING
AngelaDuckworth_2013S I WENT TO TEACH SEVENTH GRADERS MATH IN THE NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND LIKE ANY TEACHER I MADE QUIZZES AND TESTS I GAVE OUT HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS WHEN THE WORK CAME BACK I CALCULATED GRADES
AngelaDuckworth_2013S WHAT STRUCK ME WAS THAT I Q WAS NOT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY BEST AND MY WORST STUDENTS
AngelaDuckworth_2013S SOME OF MY STRONGEST PERFORMERS DID NOT HAVE STRATOSPHERIC I Q SCORES SOME OF MY SMARTEST KIDS WEREN 'T DOING SO WELL AND THAT GOT ME THINKING
AngelaDuckworth_2013S IF THEY WORKED HARD AND LONG ENOUGH
AngelaDuckworth_2013S AFTER SEVERAL MORE YEARS OF TEACHING
AngelaDuckworth_2013S I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WHAT WE NEED IN EDUCATION IS A MUCH BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF STUDENTS AND LEARNING FROM A MOTIVATIONAL PERSPECTIVE FROM A PSYCHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE IN EDUCATION THE ONE THING WE KNOW HOW TO MEASURE BEST IS I Q
AngelaDuckworth_2013S BUT WHAT IF DOING WELL IN SCHOOL AND IN LIFE DEPENDS ON MUCH MORE THAN YOUR ABILITY TO LEARN QUICKLY AND EASILY
AngelaDuckworth_2013S SO I LEFT THE CLASSROOM AND I WENT TO GRADUATE SCHOOL TO BECOME A PSYCHOLOGIST I STARTED STUDYING KIDS AND ADULTS IN ALL KINDS OF SUPER CHALLENGING SETTINGS AND IN EVERY STUDY MY QUESTION WAS WHO IS SUCCESSFUL HERE AND WHY
AngelaDuckworth_2013S MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO WEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMY WE TRIED TO PREDICT WHICH CADETS WOULD STAY IN MILITARY TRAINING AND WHICH WOULD DROP OUT WE WENT TO THE NATIONAL SPELLING BEE AND TRIED TO PREDICT WHICH CHILDREN WOULD ADVANCE FARTHEST IN COMPETITION
AngelaDuckworth_2013S WE STUDIED ROOKIE TEACHERS WORKING IN REALLY TOUGH NEIGHBORHOODS ASKING WHICH TEACHERS ARE STILL GOING TO BE HERE IN TEACHING BY THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR AND OF THOSE WHO WILL BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AT IMPROVING LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THEIR STUDENTS
AngelaDuckworth_2013S WE PARTNERED WITH PRIVATE COMPANIES ASKING WHICH OF THESE SALESPEOPLE IS GOING TO KEEP THEIR JOBS AND WHO 'S GOING TO EARN THE MOST MONEY
AngelaDuckworth_2013S BUT FOR YEARS AND WORKING REALLY HARD TO MAKE THAT FUTURE A REALITY GRIT IS LIVING LIFE LIKE IT 'S A MARATHON NOT A SPRINT
AngelaDuckworth_2013S A FEW YEARS AGO I STARTED STUDYING GRIT IN THE CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS I ASKED THOUSANDS OF HIGH SCHOOL JUNIORS TO TAKE GRIT QUESTIONNAIRES AND THEN WAITED AROUND MORE THAN A YEAR TO SEE WHO WOULD GRADUATE
AngelaDuckworth_2013S TURNS OUT THAT GRITTIER KIDS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE
AngelaDuckworth_2013S EVEN WHEN I MATCHED THEM ON EVERY CHARACTERISTIC I COULD MEASURE THINGS LIKE FAMILY INCOME STANDARDIZED ACHIEVEMENT TEST SCORES EVEN HOW SAFE KIDS FELT WHEN THEY WERE AT SCHOOL
AngelaDuckworth_2013S SO IT 'S NOT JUST AT WEST POINT OR THE NATIONAL SPELLING BEE THAT GRIT MATTERS IT 'S ALSO IN SCHOOL ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS AT RISK FOR DROPPING OUT
AngelaDuckworth_2013S TO ME THE MOST SHOCKING THING ABOUT GRIT
AngelaDuckworth_2013S IS HOW LITTLE WE KNOW HOW LITTLE SCIENCE KNOWS ABOUT BUILDING IT EVERY DAY PARENTS AND TEACHERS ASK ME HOW DO I BUILD GRIT IN KIDS WHAT DO I DO TO TEACH KIDS A SOLID WORK ETHIC HOW DO I KEEP THEM MOTIVATED FOR THE LONG RUN
AngelaDuckworth_2013S THE HONEST ANSWER IS I DON 'T KNOW LAUGHTER WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT TALENT DOESN 'T MAKE YOU GRITTY
AngelaDuckworth_2013S OUR DATA SHOW VERY CLEARLY THAT THERE ARE MANY TALENTED INDIVIDUALS WHO SIMPLY DO NOT FOLLOW THROUGH ON THEIR COMMITMENTS IN FACT IN OUR DATA GRIT IS USUALLY UNRELATED OR EVEN INVERSELY RELATED TO MEASURES OF TALENT
AngelaDuckworth_2013S SO FAR THE BEST IDEA I 'VE HEARD ABOUT BUILDING GRIT IN KIDS IS SOMETHING CALLED GROWTH MINDSET THIS IS AN IDEA DEVELOPED AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY BY CAROL DWECK AND IT IS THE BELIEF THAT THE ABILITY TO LEARN IS NOT FIXED THAT IT CAN CHANGE WITH YOUR EFFORT
AngelaDuckworth_2013S DR DWECK HAS SHOWN THAT WHEN KIDS READ AND LEARN ABOUT THE BRAIN AND HOW IT CHANGES AND GROWS IN RESPONSE TO CHALLENGE THEY 'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO PERSEVERE WHEN THEY FAIL BECAUSE THEY DON 'T BELIEVE THAT FAILURE IS A PERMANENT CONDITION
AngelaDuckworth_2013S SO GROWTH MINDSET IS A GREAT IDEA FOR BUILDING GRIT
AngelaDuckworth_2013S BUT WE NEED MORE AND THAT 'S WHERE I 'M GOING TO END MY REMARKS BECAUSE THAT 'S WHERE WE ARE THAT 'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
AngelaDuckworth_2013S WE NEED TO TAKE OUR BEST IDEAS OUR STRONGEST INTUITIONS AND WE NEED TO TEST THEM WE NEED TO MEASURE WHETHER WE 'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND WE HAVE TO BE WILLING TO FAIL TO BE WRONG TO START OVER AGAIN WITH LESSONS LEARNED
