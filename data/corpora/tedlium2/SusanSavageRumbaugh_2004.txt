SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@16.14:20.55 HAPPY MOST OF THE TIME BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS THE HAPPIEST SPECIES ON THE PLANET
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@21.39:25.59 IT'S KIND OF A WELL KEPT SECRET THIS SPECIES LIVES ONLY IN THE CONGO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@26.10:30.55 AND THEY'RE NOT IN TOO MANY ZOOS BECAUSE OF THEIR SEXUAL BEHAVIOR
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@39.74:47.44 ACTUALLY WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN FROM THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE A VERY EGALITARIAN SOCIETY AND THEY'RE A VERY EMPATHETIC SOCIETY
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@56.62:58.71 AND IT'S USED FOR COMMUNICATION
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@72.40:74.68 AND SO EVERYTHING SORT OF HAS A PLACE THAT IT HAS TO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@75.89:78.64 BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE WERE THAT WAY INITIALLY
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@87.68:90.74 MAYBE IT'S HIS ABILITY TO HAVE CAUSAL THOUGHT
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@91.78:96.34 MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING SPECIAL IN HIS BRAIN THAT ALLOWS HIM TO HAVE LANGUAGE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@97.34:99.52 MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING SPECIAL IN HIS BRAIN
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@99.89:101.94 THAT ALLOWS HIM TO MAKE TOOLS
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@106.86:108.88 THERE WERE TASMANIANS
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@109.64:112.32 WHO WERE DISCOVERED AROUND THE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS AND THEY HAD
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@117.50:119.22 TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THEY HAD NO MUSIC
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@121.50:123.43 SO WHEN YOU COMPARE THEM TO THE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@126.36:126.65 THE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@130.04:131.37 HE DOESN'T STAND QUITE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@143.01:144.32 HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@145.87:147.87 I DON'T REALLY THINK IT'S IN OUR BIOLOGY
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@148.26:150.21 I THINK WE'VE ATTRIBUTED IT TO OUR BIOLOGY
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@150.77:152.34 BUT I DON'T REALLY THINK IT'S THERE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@153.14:156.59 SO WHAT I WANT TO DO NOW IS INTRODUCE YOU TO A SPECIES CALLED THE BONOBO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@170.88:172.64 AND SHE CAME TO US WHEN SHE WAS A
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@173.24:176.34 JUST AT PUBERTY ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OF AGE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@177.32:180.99 NOW THIS SHOWS A BONOBO ON YOUR RIGHT AND A CHIMPANZEE ON YOUR LEFT
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@186.69:189.45 ALTHOUGH SHORTER THAN US AND THEIR ARMS STILL LONGER
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@190.01:192.80 IS MORE UPRIGHT JUST AS WE ARE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@215.10:220.57 HAVE TO ROTATE QUITE SO MUCH FROM SIDE TO SIDE SO THE THE BIPEDAL GAIT IS A LITTLE EASIER
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@220.79:229.15 AND NOW WE SEE ALL FOUR THE WILD BONOBO LIVES IN CENTRAL AFRICA IN THE JUNGLE ENCIRCLED BY THE CONGO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@233.52:239.50 TREES AS TALL AS FORTY METERS ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FEET GROW DENSELY IN THE AREA
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@240.88:249.10 IT WAS A JAPANESE SCIENTIST WHO FIRST UNDERTOOK SERIOUS FIELD STUDIES OF THE BONOBO ALMOST THREE DECADES
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@253.40:257.08 BONOBOS ARE BUILT SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN THE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@259.51:261.93 BY NATURE VERY GENTLE CREATURES
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@263.79:267.78 LONG AND CAREFUL STUDIES HAVE REPORTED MANY NEW FINDINGS ON
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@270.76:272.61 ONE DISCOVERY WAS THAT
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@283.82:286.99 TO WALK UPRIGHT FOR LONG DISTANCES
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@295.66:296.17 AND THEN GO TO THE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@301.57:303.73 YOU WILL SEE IN THIS PARTICULAR VIDEO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@334.89:336.00 MORE STICKS TOO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@343.20:345.19 I HAVE A LIGHTER IN MY POCKET IF YOU NEED ONE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@354.11:356.86 I HOPE I HAVE A LIGHTER YOU CAN USE THE LIGHTER TO START THE FIRE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@359.67:363.82 VERY INTERESTED IN FIRE HE DOESN'T DO IT YET WITHOUT A LIGHTER
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@367.29:368.05 MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@390.73:392.10 IS A SMILE ON THE FACE OF
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@398.68:400.57 SOME WATER ON THE FIRE YOU SEE THE WATER
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@425.31:426.88 THIS IS HIS SISTER THIS IS HER
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@454.96:457.99 SHE KNOWS THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL IN THE MIRROR IS HER
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@461.48:472.63 BY RAISING BONOBOS IN A CULTURE THAT IS BOTH BONOBO AND HUMAN AND DOCUMENTING THEIR DEVELOPMENT ACROSS TWO DECADES SCIENTISTS ARE EXPLORING HOW
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@481.30:482.98 IT MEANS STAR IN
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@493.86:494.77 IS TRYING TO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@499.60:508.92 IN THE WILD THE PARENT BONOBO IS KNOWN TO GROOM ITS OFFSPRING HERE PANBANISHA USES SCISSORS INSTEAD OF HER HANDS TO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@533.90:537.75 TRIES TO IMITATE PANBANISHA BY USING THE SCISSORS HIMSELF
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@540.77:549.13 REALIZING THAT NYOTA MIGHT GET HURT PANBANISHA LIKE ANY HUMAN MOTHER CAREFULLY TUGS TO GET THE SCISSORS BACK
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@564.97:566.70 CUT THROUGH TOUGH ANIMAL
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@573.01:579.22 HAVE MADE THEM TWO AND A HALF MILLION YEARS AGO BY HOLDING THE ROCKS IN BOTH HANDS TO STRIKE ONE AGAINST
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@580.91:591.16 HE HAS LEARNT THAT BY USING BOTH HANDS AND AIMING HIS GLANCING BLOWS HE CAN MAKE MUCH LARGER SHARPER FLAKES KANZI CHOOSES A FLAKE HE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@597.47:606.75 THE TOUGH HIDE IS DIFFICULT TO CUT EVEN WITH A KNIFE THE ROCK THAT KANZI IS USING IS EXTREMELY HARD AND IDEAL FOR STONE TOOL MAKING
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@606.91:615.28 BUT DIFFICULT TO HANDLE REQUIRING GREAT SKILL KANZI 'S ROCK IS FROM GONA ETHIOPIA AND IS IDENTICAL TO THAT USED BY OUR
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@616.10:618.60 ANCESTORS TWO AND A HALF MILLION YEARS AGO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@621.92:629.08 THESE ARE THE ROCKS KANZI USED AND THESE ARE THE FLAKES HE MADE THE FLAT SHARP EDGES ARE LIKE KNIFE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@631.48:637.99 COMPARE THEM TO THE TOOLS OUR ANCESTORS USED THEY BEAR A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO KANZI 'S
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@655.46:658.04 THIS IS LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING WE DIDN'T THINK THEY WOULD DO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@669.79:673.34 BUT SINCE I'M ADVISED NOT TO DO WHAT I NORMALLY DO I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU THAT
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@680.32:680.88 SHE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@690.75:694.06 NOW SHE COMES UP TO DOCTOR SUE AND STARTS WRITING AGAIN
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@694.94:696.36 THESE ARE HER SYMBOLS ON
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@727.43:728.12 VERY
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@738.38:739.84 PLACE IN THE WOODS THE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@741.49:742.26 SIMILAR TO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@746.89:749.47 THE NEXT SYMBOL PANBANISHA WRITES REPRESENTS
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@753.16:754.47 WHEN SHE GOES OUT
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@757.30:764.04 THIS SYMBOL IS NOT AS CLEAR AS THE OTHERS BUT ONE CAN SEE PANBANISHA IS TRYING TO PRODUCE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@764.77:766.15 LINE AND SEVERAL STRAIGHT
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@768.29:774.69 RESEARCHERS BEGAN TO RECORD WHAT PANBANISHA SAID BY WRITING LEXIGRAMS ON THE FLOOR WITH CHALK
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@782.97:784.75 STUNNED SCIENTISTS AROUND
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@794.66:796.53 IT'S SIMPLY TO USE LANGUAGE AROUND
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@797.67:805.13 BECAUSE THE DRIVING FORCE IN LANGUAGE ACQUISITION IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT OTHERS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU ARE SAYING TO YOU
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@814.74:822.62 SO WE WANT TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH BONOBOS LIKE ALL OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH WHOM THEY ARE INTERACTING WE WANT TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@831.58:836.07 THIS ENVIRONMENT BRINGS OUT UNEXPECTED POTENTIAL IN KANZI AND PANBANISHA
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@849.17:856.04 UNTIL NYOTA NOW ONE YEAR OLD STEALS IT THEN HE PEERS EAGERLY INTO HIS MOTHER 'S MOUTH
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@856.67:858.92 LOOKING FOR WHERE THE SOUND CAME FROM
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@859.51:863.28 DOCTOR SUE THINKS IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALLOW SUCH CURIOSITY
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@874.43:883.93 THIS TIME PANBANISHA IS PLAYING THE ELECTRIC PIANO SHE WASN'T FORCED TO LEARN THE PIANO SHE SAW A RESEARCHER PLAY THE INSTRUMENT AND TOOK AN INTEREST
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@935.14:936.86 WHICH PROMOTES THE EMERGENCE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@960.54:965.83 STAY AWAY FROM THEM NOW NOW YOU CAN CHASE THEM AGAIN TIME TO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@985.16:988.02 VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@1013.99:1017.17 LEARNING HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM IN REALLY HIGH PITCHED TONES
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@1018.11:1020.88 WE'RE LEARNING THAT THEY PROBABLY HAVE A LANGUAGE IN THE WILD
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004@1027.19:1031.86 SO WE'RE SHARING TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY AND LANGUAGE WITH ANOTHER SPECIES
