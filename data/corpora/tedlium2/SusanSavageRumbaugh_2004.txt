SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 HAPPY MOST OF THE TIME BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS THE HAPPIEST SPECIES ON THE PLANET
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 IT'S KIND OF A WELL KEPT SECRET THIS SPECIES LIVES ONLY IN THE CONGO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 AND THEY'RE NOT IN TOO MANY ZOOS BECAUSE OF THEIR SEXUAL BEHAVIOR
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 ACTUALLY WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN FROM THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE A VERY EGALITARIAN SOCIETY AND THEY'RE A VERY EMPATHETIC SOCIETY
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 AND IT'S USED FOR COMMUNICATION
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 AND SO EVERYTHING SORT OF HAS A PLACE THAT IT HAS TO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE WERE THAT WAY INITIALLY
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 MAYBE IT'S HIS ABILITY TO HAVE CAUSAL THOUGHT
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING SPECIAL IN HIS BRAIN THAT ALLOWS HIM TO HAVE LANGUAGE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING SPECIAL IN HIS BRAIN
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 THAT ALLOWS HIM TO MAKE TOOLS
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 THERE WERE TASMANIANS
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 WHO WERE DISCOVERED AROUND THE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS AND THEY HAD
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THEY HAD NO MUSIC
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 SO WHEN YOU COMPARE THEM TO THE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 THE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 HE DOESN'T STAND QUITE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 I DON'T REALLY THINK IT'S IN OUR BIOLOGY
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 I THINK WE'VE ATTRIBUTED IT TO OUR BIOLOGY
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 BUT I DON'T REALLY THINK IT'S THERE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 SO WHAT I WANT TO DO NOW IS INTRODUCE YOU TO A SPECIES CALLED THE BONOBO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 AND SHE CAME TO US WHEN SHE WAS A
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 JUST AT PUBERTY ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OF AGE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 NOW THIS SHOWS A BONOBO ON YOUR RIGHT AND A CHIMPANZEE ON YOUR LEFT
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 ALTHOUGH SHORTER THAN US AND THEIR ARMS STILL LONGER
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 IS MORE UPRIGHT JUST AS WE ARE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 HAVE TO ROTATE QUITE SO MUCH FROM SIDE TO SIDE SO THE THE BIPEDAL GAIT IS A LITTLE EASIER
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 AND NOW WE SEE ALL FOUR THE WILD BONOBO LIVES IN CENTRAL AFRICA IN THE JUNGLE ENCIRCLED BY THE CONGO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 TREES AS TALL AS FORTY METERS ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FEET GROW DENSELY IN THE AREA
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 IT WAS A JAPANESE SCIENTIST WHO FIRST UNDERTOOK SERIOUS FIELD STUDIES OF THE BONOBO ALMOST THREE DECADES
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 BONOBOS ARE BUILT SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN THE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 BY NATURE VERY GENTLE CREATURES
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 LONG AND CAREFUL STUDIES HAVE REPORTED MANY NEW FINDINGS ON
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 ONE DISCOVERY WAS THAT
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 TO WALK UPRIGHT FOR LONG DISTANCES
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 AND THEN GO TO THE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 YOU WILL SEE IN THIS PARTICULAR VIDEO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 MORE STICKS TOO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 I HAVE A LIGHTER IN MY POCKET IF YOU NEED ONE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 I HOPE I HAVE A LIGHTER YOU CAN USE THE LIGHTER TO START THE FIRE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 VERY INTERESTED IN FIRE HE DOESN'T DO IT YET WITHOUT A LIGHTER
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 IS A SMILE ON THE FACE OF
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 SOME WATER ON THE FIRE YOU SEE THE WATER
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 THIS IS HIS SISTER THIS IS HER
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 SHE KNOWS THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL IN THE MIRROR IS HER
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 BY RAISING BONOBOS IN A CULTURE THAT IS BOTH BONOBO AND HUMAN AND DOCUMENTING THEIR DEVELOPMENT ACROSS TWO DECADES SCIENTISTS ARE EXPLORING HOW
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 IT MEANS STAR IN
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 IS TRYING TO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 IN THE WILD THE PARENT BONOBO IS KNOWN TO GROOM ITS OFFSPRING HERE PANBANISHA USES SCISSORS INSTEAD OF HER HANDS TO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 TRIES TO IMITATE PANBANISHA BY USING THE SCISSORS HIMSELF
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 REALIZING THAT NYOTA MIGHT GET HURT PANBANISHA LIKE ANY HUMAN MOTHER CAREFULLY TUGS TO GET THE SCISSORS BACK
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 CUT THROUGH TOUGH ANIMAL
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 HAVE MADE THEM TWO AND A HALF MILLION YEARS AGO BY HOLDING THE ROCKS IN BOTH HANDS TO STRIKE ONE AGAINST
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 HE HAS LEARNT THAT BY USING BOTH HANDS AND AIMING HIS GLANCING BLOWS HE CAN MAKE MUCH LARGER SHARPER FLAKES KANZI CHOOSES A FLAKE HE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 THE TOUGH HIDE IS DIFFICULT TO CUT EVEN WITH A KNIFE THE ROCK THAT KANZI IS USING IS EXTREMELY HARD AND IDEAL FOR STONE TOOL MAKING
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 BUT DIFFICULT TO HANDLE REQUIRING GREAT SKILL KANZI 'S ROCK IS FROM GONA ETHIOPIA AND IS IDENTICAL TO THAT USED BY OUR
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 ANCESTORS TWO AND A HALF MILLION YEARS AGO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 THESE ARE THE ROCKS KANZI USED AND THESE ARE THE FLAKES HE MADE THE FLAT SHARP EDGES ARE LIKE KNIFE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 COMPARE THEM TO THE TOOLS OUR ANCESTORS USED THEY BEAR A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO KANZI 'S
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 THIS IS LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING WE DIDN'T THINK THEY WOULD DO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 BUT SINCE I'M ADVISED NOT TO DO WHAT I NORMALLY DO I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU THAT
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 SHE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 NOW SHE COMES UP TO DOCTOR SUE AND STARTS WRITING AGAIN
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 THESE ARE HER SYMBOLS ON
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 VERY
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 PLACE IN THE WOODS THE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 SIMILAR TO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 THE NEXT SYMBOL PANBANISHA WRITES REPRESENTS
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 WHEN SHE GOES OUT
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 THIS SYMBOL IS NOT AS CLEAR AS THE OTHERS BUT ONE CAN SEE PANBANISHA IS TRYING TO PRODUCE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 LINE AND SEVERAL STRAIGHT
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 RESEARCHERS BEGAN TO RECORD WHAT PANBANISHA SAID BY WRITING LEXIGRAMS ON THE FLOOR WITH CHALK
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 STUNNED SCIENTISTS AROUND
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 IT'S SIMPLY TO USE LANGUAGE AROUND
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 BECAUSE THE DRIVING FORCE IN LANGUAGE ACQUISITION IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT OTHERS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU ARE SAYING TO YOU
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 SO WE WANT TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH BONOBOS LIKE ALL OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH WHOM THEY ARE INTERACTING WE WANT TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 THIS ENVIRONMENT BRINGS OUT UNEXPECTED POTENTIAL IN KANZI AND PANBANISHA
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 UNTIL NYOTA NOW ONE YEAR OLD STEALS IT THEN HE PEERS EAGERLY INTO HIS MOTHER 'S MOUTH
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 LOOKING FOR WHERE THE SOUND CAME FROM
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 DOCTOR SUE THINKS IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALLOW SUCH CURIOSITY
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 THIS TIME PANBANISHA IS PLAYING THE ELECTRIC PIANO SHE WASN'T FORCED TO LEARN THE PIANO SHE SAW A RESEARCHER PLAY THE INSTRUMENT AND TOOK AN INTEREST
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 WHICH PROMOTES THE EMERGENCE
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 STAY AWAY FROM THEM NOW NOW YOU CAN CHASE THEM AGAIN TIME TO
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 LEARNING HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM IN REALLY HIGH PITCHED TONES
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 WE'RE LEARNING THAT THEY PROBABLY HAVE A LANGUAGE IN THE WILD
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 SO WE'RE SHARING TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY AND LANGUAGE WITH ANOTHER SPECIES
