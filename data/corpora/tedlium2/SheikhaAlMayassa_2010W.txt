SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W MYSELF AND MY BROTHER BELONG TO THE UNDER THIRTY DEMOGRAPHIC
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W WHICH PAT SAID MAKES SEVENTY PERCENT BUT ACCORDING TO OUR STATISTICS IT MAKES SIXTY PERCENT OF THE REGION 'S POPULATION
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W WE HAVE BEEN REMINISCING ABOUT THE LATEST TECHNOLOGIES AND THE IPODS AND FOR ME THE ABAYA MY TRADITIONAL DRESS THAT I 'M WEARING TODAY
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W NOW THIS IS NOT A RELIGIOUS GARMENT NOR IS IT A RELIGIOUS STATEMENT INSTEAD IT 'S A DIVERSE CULTURAL STATEMENT THAT WE CHOOSE TO WEAR NOW I REMEMBER A FEW YEARS AGO
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W HER ANSWER WAS QUITE THE CONTRARY INSTEAD SHE FELT MORE FREE MORE FREE BECAUSE SHE COULD WEAR WHATEVER SHE WANTED UNDER THE ABAYA SHE COULD COME TO WORK IN HER PAJAMAS AND NOBODY WOULD CARE
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W WE KNOW THAT MODERNIZATION IS HAPPENING AND YES QATAR WANTS TO BE A MODERN NATION BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE RECONNECTING AND REASSERTING OUR ARAB HERITAGE
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W IT 'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO GROW ORGANICALLY AND WE CONTINUOUSLY MAKE THE CONSCIOUS DECISION TO REACH THAT BALANCE IN FACT RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE MORE THE WORLD IS FLAT IF I USE TOM FRIEDMAN 'S ANALOGY OR GLOBAL
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W THE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE WANTING TO BE DIFFERENT AND FOR US YOUNG PEOPLE THEY 'RE LOOKING TO BECOME INDIVIDUALS AND FIND THEIR DIFFERENCES AMONGST THEMSELVES
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W WHICH IS WHY I PREFER THE RICHARD WILK ANALOGY OF GLOBALIZING THE LOCAL AND LOCALIZING THE GLOBAL WE DON 'T WANT TO BE ALL THE SAME BUT WE WANT TO RESPECT EACH OTHER AND UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W AND THEREFORE TRADITION BECOMES MORE IMPORTANT NOT LESS IMPORTANT
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W I 'M A REPRESENTATION OF THAT PHENOMENON
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM I CAN SEE A LOT OF YOU ARE IN THE SAME POSITION AS MYSELF AND I 'M SURE ALTHOUGH WE CAN 'T SEE THE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON THEY ARE IN THE SAME POSITION WE 'RE CONTINUOUSLY TRYING TO STRADDLE DIFFERENT WORLDS DIFFERENT CULTURES AND TRYING TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF A DIFFERENT EXPECTATION FROM OURSELVES AND FROM OTHERS
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W SO I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION WHAT SHOULD CULTURE IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY LOOK LIKE
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W IN A TIME WHERE THE WORLD IS BECOMING PERSONALIZED WHEN THE MOBILE PHONE THE BURGER THE TELEPHONE EVERYTHING HAS ITS OWN PERSONAL IDENTITY HOW SHOULD WE PERCEIVE OURSELVES AND HOW SHOULD WE PERCEIVE OTHERS HOW DOES THAT IMPACT OUR DESERT CULTURE
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W I 'M NOT SURE OF HOW MANY OF YOU IN WASHINGTON ARE AWARE OF THE CULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS HAPPENING IN THE REGION AND THE MORE RECENT MUSEUM OF ISLAMIC ART OPENED IN QATAR IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT I MYSELF AM PERSONALIZING THESE CULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS HAS TO BE DONE ORGANICALLY
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W YES WE DO HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO DEVELOP NEW CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS BUT WHAT I THINK IS MORE IMPORTANT IS THAT WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE VISIONARY LEADERS WHO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CAN 'T HAPPEN FROM OUTSIDE IT HAS TO COME FROM WITHIN
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W I WANT TO ASK YOU WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W IS IT BECAUSE IT 'S A SOFT OPTION WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO NO I DON 'T THINK SO I THINK THAT WOMEN IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD REALIZE THAT CULTURE IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT TO CONNECT PEOPLE BOTH LOCALLY AND REGIONALLY
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W IT 'S A NATURAL COMPONENT FOR BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER DISCUSSING IDEAS IN THE SAME WAY WE 'RE DOING HERE AT TED WE 'RE HERE WE 'RE PART OF A COMMUNITY SHARING OUT IDEAS AND DISCUSSING THEM ART BECOMES A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR NATIONAL IDENTITY
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W THE EXISTENTIAL AND SOCIAL AND POLITICAL IMPACT
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W AN ARTIST HAS ON HIS NATION 'S DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURAL IDENTITY IS VERY IMPORTANT
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W FOR THEIR FUTURE GENERATIONS IT 'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN OUR CULTURAL IDENTITIES
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W WHY ELSE DO GREEKS DEMAND THE RETURN OF THE ELGIN MARBLES AND WHY IS THERE AN UPROAR WHEN A PRIVATE COLLECTOR TRIES TO SELL HIS COLLECTION TO A FOREIGN MUSEUM WHY DOES IT TAKE ME MONTHS ON END TO GET AN EXPORT LICENSE FROM LONDON OR NEW YORK IN ORDER TO GET PIECES INTO MY COUNTRY
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W INSTEAD SHE TRIES TO ENGAGE IN A VERY IMPORTANT DIALOGUE ABOUT HER CULTURE NATION AND HERITAGE SHE DOES THAT THROUGH IMPORTANT VISUAL FORMS OF PHOTOGRAPHY AND FILM
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W CREATE AN OPEN DIALOGUE SO THAT WE SHARE OUR IDEAS AND SHARE YOURS WITH US
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W IN A FEW DAYS WE WILL BE OPENING THE ARAB MUSEUM OF MODERN ART
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W WE HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH TO ENSURE THAT ARAB AND MUSLIM ARTISTS AND ARABS WHO ARE NOT MUSLIMS NOT ALL ARABS ARE MUSLIMS BY THE WAY BUT WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE REPRESENTED IN THIS NEW INSTITUTION THIS INSTITUTION IS GOVERNMENT BACKED AND IT HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR THE PAST THREE DECADES
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W WE WILL OPEN THE MUSEUM IN A FEW DAYS AND I WELCOME ALL OF YOU TO GET ON QATAR AIRWAYS AND COME AND JOIN US
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W NOW THIS MUSEUM IS JUST AS IMPORTANT TO US AS THE WEST
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W NOW VISUAL EXPRESSION IS JUST ONE FORM OF CULTURE INTEGRATION
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W WE HAVE REALIZED THAT RECENTLY MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE USING THE MEANS OF YOUTUBE AND SOCIAL NETWORKING TO EXPRESS THEIR STORIES SHARE THEIR PHOTOS AND TELL THEIR OWN STORIES THROUGH THEIR OWN VOICES IN A SIMILAR WAY WE HAVE CREATED THE DOHA FILM INSTITUTE
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W NOW THE DOHA FILM INSTITUTE IS AN ORGANIZATION TO TEACH PEOPLE ABOUT FILM AND FILMMAKING LAST YEAR WE DIDN 'T HAVE ONE QATARI WOMAN FILMMAKER TODAY I AM PROUD TO SAY WE HAVE TRAINED AND EDUCATED OVER SIXTY SIX QATARI WOMEN FILMMAKERS TO EDIT TELL THEIR OWN STORIES IN THEIR OWN VOICES
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W IF YOU 'LL ALLOW ME I WOULD LOVE TO SHARE A ONE MINUTE FILM
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W THAT HAS PROVEN TO SHOW THAT A SIXTY SEC FILM CAN BE AS POWERFUL AS A HAIKU IN TELLING A BIG PICTURE AND THIS IS ONE OF OUR FILMMAKERS PRODUCTS
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W IT 'S IMPORTANT FOR TWO THINGS
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W FIRST IT ALLOWS US TO SHOWCASE OUR ARAB FILMMAKERS AND VOICES TO ONE OF THE MOST COSMOPOLITAN CITIES IN THE WORLD NEW YORK CITY
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W NO NOT THE SOFT OPTION THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED BEFORE BUT RATHER THE SOFT POWER THAT JOSEPH NYE HAS SPOKEN ABOUT BEFORE
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W CULTURE 'S A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER WE SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING JOURNEY I WELCOME YOU ON BOARD FOR US TO ENGAGE AND DISCUSS NEW IDEAS OF HOW TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER THROUGH CULTURAL INITIATIVES AND DISCUSSIONS
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
