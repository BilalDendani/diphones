MikedeGruy_2010Z I FIRST BECAME FASCINATED WITH OCTOPUS AT AN EARLY AGE I GREW UP IN MOBILE ALABAMA SOMEBODY 'S GOT TO BE FROM MOBILE RIGHT AND MOBILE SITS AT THE CONFLUENCE OF FIVE RIVERS FORMING THIS BEAUTIFUL DELTA
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND THE DELTA HAS ALLIGATORS CRAWLING IN AND OUT OF RIVERS FILLED WITH FISH AND CYPRESS TREES DRIPPING WITH SNAKES BIRDS OF EVERY FLAVOR IT'S AN ABSOLUTE MAGICAL WONDERLAND
MikedeGruy_2010Z TO LIVE IN IF YOU'RE A KID INTERESTED IN ANIMALS TO GROW UP IN AND THIS DELTA WATER FLOWS TO MOBILE BAY AND FINALLY INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO AND I REMEMBER MY FIRST REAL CONTACT WITH OCTOPUS WAS PROBABLY AT AGE FIVE OR SIX I WAS IN THE GULF
MikedeGruy_2010Z SWIMMING AROUND AND SAW A LITTLE OCTOPUS ON THE BOTTOM AND I REACHED DOWN AND PICKED HIM UP AND IMMEDIATELY BECAME FASCINATED AND IMPRESSED BY ITS SPEED AND ITS STRENGTH AND AGILITY
MikedeGruy_2010Z IT WAS PRYING MY FINGERS APART AND MOVING TO THE BACK OF MY HAND IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO HOLD ON TO THIS AMAZING CREATURE
MikedeGruy_2010Z SORT OF CALMED DOWN IN THE PALMS OF MY HANDS AND STARTED FLASHING COLORS JUST PULSING ALL OF THESE COLORS AND AS I LOOKED AT IT IT KIND OF TUCKED ITS ARMS UNDER IT RAISED INTO A SPHERICAL SHAPE AND TURNED CHOCOLATE BROWN WITH TWO WHITE STRIPES
MikedeGruy_2010Z I'M GOING MY GOSH I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN MY LIFE SO I MARVELED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO RELEASE HIM SO I PUT HIM DOWN
MikedeGruy_2010Z THE OCTOPUS LEFT MY HANDS AND THEN DID THE DAMNEDEST THING IT LANDED ON THE BOTTOM IN THE RUBBLE AND
MikedeGruy_2010Z AT HAWAII I WORKED AT THE WAIKIKI AQUARIUM AND THE AQUARIUM HAD A LOT OF BIG FISH TANKS BUT NOT A LOT OF INVERTEBRATE DISPLAYS AND BEING THE SPINELESS GUY I THOUGHT WELL
MikedeGruy_2010Z I'LL JUST GO OUT IN THE FIELD AND COLLECT THESE WONDERFUL ANIMALS I HAD BEEN LEARNING ABOUT AS A STUDENT AND BRING THEM IN AND I BUILT THESE ELABORATE SETS AND PUT THEM ON DISPLAY
MikedeGruy_2010Z NOW THE FISH IN THE TANKS WERE GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT BUT THEY DIDN'T REALLY INTERACT WITH PEOPLE BUT THE OCTOPUS DID
MikedeGruy_2010Z IF YOU WALKED UP TO AN OCTOPUS TANK ESPECIALLY EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE ANYONE ARRIVED THE OCTOPUS WOULD RISE UP AND LOOK AT YOU AND YOU'RE THINKING IS THAT GUY REALLY LOOKING AT ME HE IS LOOKING
MikedeGruy_2010Z YOU WALK UP TO THE FRONT OF THE TANK THEN YOU REALIZE THAT THESE ANIMALS ALL HAVE DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES SOME OF THEM WOULD HOLD THEIR GROUND OTHERS WOULD SLINK INTO THE BACK OF THE TANK AND DISAPPEAR IN THE ROCKS AND ONE IN PARTICULAR THIS AMAZING ANIMAL
MikedeGruy_2010Z UP TO THE FRONT OF THE TANK AND HE 'S JUST STARING AT ME AND HE HAD LITTLE HORNS COME UP ABOVE HIS EYES SO I WENT RIGHT UP TO THE FRONT OF THE TANK I WAS THREE OR FOUR INCHES FROM THE FRONT GLASS
MikedeGruy_2010Z THE OCTOPUS WAS SITTING ON A PERCH A LITTLE ROCK AND HE CAME OFF THE ROCK AND HE ALSO CAME DOWN RIGHT TO THE FRONT OF THE GLASS SO I WAS STARING AT THIS ANIMAL
MikedeGruy_2010Z THIS GRAVEL HITS THE FRONT OF THE GLASS AND FALLS DOWN HE REACHES UP TAKES ANOTHER ARMFUL OF GRAVEL RELEASES IT
MikedeGruy_2010Z THEN HE LIFTS UP AN ARM SO I LIFT AN ARM THEN HE LIFTS ANOTHER ARM
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND I LIFT ANOTHER ARM AND THEN I REALIZE THE OCTOPUS WON THE ARMS RACE BECAUSE I WAS OUT AND HE HAD SIX LEFT
MikedeGruy_2010Z BUT THE ONLY WAY I CAN DESCRIBE WHAT I WAS SEEING THAT DAY WAS THAT THIS OCTOPUS WAS PLAYING WHICH IS A PRETTY SOPHISTICATED BEHAVIOR FOR A MERE INVERTEBRATE
MikedeGruy_2010Z SO ABOUT THREE YEARS INTO MY DEGREE A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE OFFICE WHICH ACTUALLY CHANGED THE COURSE OF MY LIFE A MAN CAME INTO THE AQUARIUM IT'S A LONG STORY BUT ESSENTIALLY HE SENT ME AND A COUPLE OF FRIENDS OF MINE TO THE SOUTH PACIFIC
MikedeGruy_2010Z TO COLLECT ANIMALS FOR HIM AND AS WE LEFT HE GAVE US TWO SIXTEEN MM MOVIE CAMERAS HE SAID MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT THIS EXPEDITION
MikedeGruy_2010Z MAYBE I CAN DO THIS ALL THE TIME YEAH I'LL BE A FILMMAKER SO I LITERALLY CAME BACK FROM THAT JOB QUIT SCHOOL HUNG MY FILMMAKING SHINGLE AND JUST NEVER TOLD ANYONE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING IT'S BEEN A GOOD RIDE
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND WHAT I LEARNED IN SCHOOL THOUGH WAS REALLY BENEFICIAL IF YOU'RE A WILDLIFE FILMMAKER AND YOU'RE GOING OUT INTO THE FIELD TO FILM ANIMALS ESPECIALLY BEHAVIOR IT HELPS
MikedeGruy_2010Z TO HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL BACKGROUND ON WHO THESE ANIMALS ARE HOW THEY WORK AND YOU KNOW A BIT ABOUT THEIR BEHAVIORS BUT WHERE I REALLY LEARNED ABOUT OCTOPUS
MikedeGruy_2010Z WAS IN THE FIELD AS A FILMMAKER MAKING FILMS WITH THEM WHERE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO SPEND LARGE PERIODS OF TIME WITH THE ANIMALS SEEING OCTOPUS BEING OCTOPUS
MikedeGruy_2010Z IN THEIR OCEAN HOMES I REMEMBER I TOOK A TRIP TO AUSTRALIA WENT TO AN ISLAND CALLED ONE TREE ISLAND AND APPARENTLY EVOLUTION
MikedeGruy_2010Z HAD OCCURRED AT A PRETTY RAPID RATE ON ONE TREE BETWEEN THE TIME THEY NAMED IT AND THE TIME I ARRIVED BECAUSE I'M SURE THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE TREES ON THAT ISLAND WHEN WE WERE THERE
MikedeGruy_2010Z ANYWAY ONE TREE IS SITUATED RIGHT NEXT TO A BEAUTIFUL CORAL REEF IN FACT THERE'S A SURGE CHANNEL WHERE THE TIDE IS MOVING BACK AND FORTH TWICE A DAY
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND NOT UNIQUELY BUT CERTAINLY THE OCTOPUS IN AUSTRALIA ARE MASTERS AT CAMOUFLAGE AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE'S ONE RIGHT THERE
MikedeGruy_2010Z SO OUR FIRST CHALLENGE WAS TO FIND THESE THINGS AND THAT WAS A CHALLENGE INDEED BUT THE IDEA IS WE WERE THERE FOR A MONTH AND I WANTED TO ACCLIMATE THE ANIMALS TO US SO THAT WE COULD SEE BEHAVIORS WITHOUT DISTURBING THEM SO THE FIRST WEEK WAS PRETTY MUCH
MikedeGruy_2010Z COME BACK IN A FEW HOURS COME AFTER THE FIRST WEEK THEY IGNORED US IT WAS LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT THING IS BUT HE 'S NO THREAT TO ME SO THEY WENT ON ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS AND FROM A A FOOT AWAY WE'RE WATCHING MATING AND
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND FIGHTING AND IT IS JUST AN UNBELIEVABLE EXPERIENCE AND ONE OF THE MOST FANTASTIC DISPLAYS THAT I REMEMBER OR AT LEAST VISUALLY WAS A FORAGING BEHAVIOR
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND THEY HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES THAT THEY WOULD USE FOR FORAGING BUT THIS PARTICULAR ONE USED VISION AND THEY WOULD SEE A CORAL HEAD MAYBE TEN FEET AWAY
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND GO THROUGH THE WATER AND LAND RIGHT ON TOP OF THIS CORAL HEAD AND THEN THE WEB BETWEEN THE ARMS WOULD COMPLETELY ENGULF THE CORAL HEAD AND THEY WOULD FISH OUT SWIM FOR CRABS
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND AS SOON AS THE CRABS TOUCHED THE ARM IT WAS LIGHTS OUT AND I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT HAPPENED UNDER THAT WEB SO WE CREATED A WAY TO FIND OUT
MikedeGruy_2010Z I CAN'T SAY OCTOPUS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MY REALLY STRONG INTEREST FOR GETTING IN SUBS AND GOING DEEP BUT WHATEVER THE CASE I LIKE THAT
MikedeGruy_2010Z IT'S LIKE NOTHING YOU'VE EVER DONE IF YOU EVER REALLY WANT TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL AND SEE SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN AND HAVE AN EXCELLENT CHANCE OF SEEING SOMETHING NO ONE
MikedeGruy_2010Z HAS EVER SEEN GET IN A SUB YOU CLIMB IN SEAL THE HATCH TURN ON A LITTLE OXYGEN TURN ON THIS SCRUBBER WHICH REMOVES THE CO TWO IN THE AIR YOU BREATHE
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND IT GETS QUIET AND IT STARTS GETTING REALLY NICE
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND AS YOU GO DEEPER THAT LOVELY BLUE WATER YOU WERE LAUNCHED IN GIVES WAY TO DARKER AND DARKER BLUE AND FINALLY IT'S A RICH LAVENDER AND AFTER A COUPLE OF THOUSAND FEET
MikedeGruy_2010Z IT'S INK BLACK AND NOW YOU'VE ENTERED THE REALM OF THE MID WATER COMMUNITY
MikedeGruy_2010Z YOU COULD GIVE AN ENTIRE TALK ABOUT THE CREATURES THAT LIVE IN THE MID WATER SUFFICE TO SAY THOUGH AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
MikedeGruy_2010Z WITHOUT QUESTION THE MOST BIZARRE DESIGNS AND OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIORS ARE IN THE ANIMALS THAT LIVE IN THE MID WATER COMMUNITY
MikedeGruy_2010Z BUT WE'RE GOING TO ZIP RIGHT PAST THIS AREA THIS AREA THAT INCLUDES ABOUT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE LIVING SPACE ON OUR PLANET
MikedeGruy_2010Z SNAKING AROUND THE ENTIRE GLOBE AND THEY'RE BIG MOUNTAINS THOUSANDS OF FEET TALL SOME OF WHICH ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FEET AND BUST THROUGH THE SURFACE CREATING ISLANDS LIKE
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND THE TOP OF THIS MOUNTAIN RANGE IS SPLITTING APART CREATING A RIFT VALLEY AND WHEN YOU DIVE INTO THAT RIFT VALLEY THAT'S WHERE THE ACTION IS BECAUSE LITERALLY THOUSANDS
MikedeGruy_2010Z OF ACTIVE VOLCANOES ARE GOING OFF AT ANY POINT IN TIME ALL ALONG THIS FORTY THOUSAND MILE RANGE AND AS THESE TECTONIC PLATES ARE SPREADING APART
MikedeGruy_2010Z MAGMA LAVA IS COMING UP AND FILLING THOSE GAPS AND YOU'RE LOOKING LAND NEW LAND BEING CREATED RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES AND OVER THE TOPS OF THEM
MikedeGruy_2010Z THREE TO FOUR THOUSAND METERS OF WATER CREATING ENORMOUS PRESSURE FORCING WATER DOWN THROUGH THE CRACKS TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE EARTH UNTIL IT HITS A MAGMA CHAMBER WHERE IT BECOMES SUPER HEATED AND SUPER SATURATED WITH MINERALS
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND THIS VENT FLUID IS ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED DEGREES FAHRENHEIT THE SURROUNDING WATER IS JUST A COUPLE OF DEGREES ABOVE FREEZING SO IT IMMEDIATELY COOLS AND IT CAN NO LONGER HOLD IN SUSPENSION
MikedeGruy_2010Z ALL OF THE MATERIAL THAT IT'S DISSOLVED AND IT PRECIPITATES OUT FORMING BLACK SMOKE AND IT FORMS THESE TOWERS THESE CHIMNEYS THAT ARE TEN TWENTY THIRTY FEET TALL
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND ALL ALONG THE SIDES OF THESE CHIMNEYS IS SHIMMERING WITH HEAT AND LOADED WITH LIFE YOU'VE GOT BLACK SMOKERS GOING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND CHIMNEYS THAT HAVE TUBE WORMS THAT MIGHT BE EIGHT TO TEN FEET LONG
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND OUT OF THE TOPS OF THESE TUBE WORMS ARE THESE BEAUTIFUL RED PLUMES AND LIVING AMONGST THE TANGLE OF TUBE WORMS IS AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF ANIMALS SHRIMP FISH LOBSTERS CRAB
MikedeGruy_2010Z UNTIL THIRTY THREE YEARS AGO AND IT COMPLETELY THREW SCIENCE ON ITS HEAD IT MADE SCIENTISTS RETHINK WHERE LIFE ON EARTH MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY BEGUN
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND BEFORE THE DISCOVERY OF THESE VENTS ALL LIFE ON EARTH THE KEY TO LIFE ON EARTH WAS BELIEVED TO BE THE SUN AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS BUT DOWN THERE THERE IS NO
MikedeGruy_2010Z THERE IS NO PHOTOSYNTHESIS IT'S CHEMOSYNTHETIC ENVIRONMENT DOWN THERE DRIVING IT AND IT'S ALL SO EPHEMERAL
MikedeGruy_2010Z YOU MIGHT FILM THIS UNBELIEVABLE HYDROTHERMAL VENT WHICH YOU THINK AT THE TIME HAS TO BE ON ANOTHER PLANET IT'S AMAZING TO THINK THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY ON EARTH IT LOOKS LIKE ALIENS IN AN ALIEN ENVIRONMENT
MikedeGruy_2010Z BUT YOU GO BACK TO THIS SAME VENT EIGHT YEARS LATER AND IT CAN BE COMPLETELY DEAD THERE'S NO HOT WATER ALL OF THE ANIMALS ARE GONE THEY'RE DEAD
MikedeGruy_2010Z OF THE HYDROTHERMAL VENT COMMUNITY ISN'T REALLY DIFFERENT FROM SOME OF THE AREAS I'VE SEEN IN THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF TRAVELING AROUND MAKING FILMS WHERE
MikedeGruy_2010Z DEAD THERE'S NO CORAL ALGAE GROWING ON IT AND THE WATER 'S
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND THIS IS THE TROPICS IT'S RAINING LIKE CRAZY HERE SO THIS RAINWATER IS FLOODING DOWN THE HILLSIDE CARRYING WITH IT SEDIMENTS FROM THE CONSTRUCTION SITE SMOTHERING THE CORAL AND KILLING IT
MikedeGruy_2010Z BUT ENCOURAGINGLY I'VE SEEN JUST THE OPPOSITE I'VE BEEN TO A PLACE THAT WAS A PRETTY TRASHED BAY AND I LOOK AT IT JUST SAY YUCK AND GO AND WORK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
MikedeGruy_2010Z FIVE YEARS LATER COME BACK AND THAT SAME BAY IS NOW GORGEOUS IT'S BEAUTIFUL IT'S GOT LIVING CORAL FISH ALL OVER THE PLACE CRYSTAL CLEAR WATER
MikedeGruy_2010Z HOW IT HAPPENED IS THE LOCAL COMMUNITY GALVANIZED THEY RECOGNIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON THE HILLSIDE AND PUT A STOP TO IT ENACTED LAWS AND MADE PERMITS REQUIRED
MikedeGruy_2010Z TO DO RESPONSIBLE CONSTRUCTION AND GOLF COURSE MAINTENANCE AND STOPPED THE SEDIMENTS FLOWING INTO THE BAY AND STOPPED THE CHEMICALS FLOWING INTO THE BAY AND THE BAY RECOVERED
MikedeGruy_2010Z THE OCEAN HAS AN AMAZING ABILITY TO RECOVER IF WE'LL JUST LEAVE IT ALONE I THINK MARGARET MEAD SAID IT BEST
MikedeGruy_2010Z SHE SAID THAT A SMALL GROUP OF THOUGHTFUL PEOPLE COULD CHANGE THE WORLD INDEED IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT EVER HAS AND A SMALL GROUP OF THOUGHTFUL PEOPLE CHANGED THAT BAY I'M A BIG FAN OF GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS
MikedeGruy_2010Z I'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF LECTURES WHERE AT THE END OF IT INEVITABLY ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS THAT COMES UP IS BUT BUT WHAT CAN I DO I'M AN INDIVIDUAL I'M ONE PERSON AND THESE PROBLEMS ARE SO LARGE AND GLOBAL AND IT'S JUST OVERWHELMING
MikedeGruy_2010Z QUESTION MY ANSWER TO THAT IS DON'T LOOK AT THE BIG OVERWHELMING ISSUES OF THE WORLD LOOK IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD
MikedeGruy_2010Z LOOK IN YOUR HEART ACTUALLY WHAT DO YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT THAT ISN'T RIGHT WHERE YOU LIVE AND FIX IT CREATE A HEALING ZONE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND ENCOURAGE OTHERS
MikedeGruy_2010Z TO DO THE SAME AND MAYBE THESE HEALING ZONES CAN SPRINKLE A MAP LITTLE DOTS ON A MAP AND IN FACT THE WAY THAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE TODAY
MikedeGruy_2010Z WHERE ALASKA IS INSTANTLY KNOWING WHAT'S GOING ON IN CHINA AND THE KIWIS TO THIS AND OVER IN ENGLAND THEY TRY TO AND EVERYONE IS TALKING TO EVERYONE ELSE IT'S NOT ISOLATED POINTS ON A MAP ANYMORE IT'S A NETWORK
MikedeGruy_2010Z DO THAT AND SPREAD THE WORD
MikedeGruy_2010Z THE VENT COMMUNITY ANIMALS CAN'T REALLY DO MUCH ABOUT THE LIFE AND DEATH THAT'S GOING ON WHERE THEY LIVE BUT UP HERE WE CAN IN THEORY WE'RE THINKING RATIONAL HUMAN BEINGS
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND WE CAN MAKE CHANGES TO OUR BEHAVIOR THAT WILL INFLUENCE AND AFFECT THE ENVIRONMENT LIKE THOSE PEOPLE CHANGED THE HEALTH OF THAT
MikedeGruy_2010Z NOW SYLVIA 'S TED PRIZE WISH WAS TO BESEECH US TO DO ANYTHING WE COULD EVERYTHING WE COULD
MikedeGruy_2010Z TO SET ASIDE NOT PIN PRICKS BUT SIGNIFICANT EXPANSES OF THE OCEAN FOR PRESERVATION HOPE SPOTS SHE CALLS THEM AND I APPLAUD THAT I LOUDLY APPLAUD THAT
MikedeGruy_2010Z AND IT'S MY HOPE THAT SOME OF THESE HOPE SPOTS CAN BE IN THE DEEP OCEAN AN AREA THAT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN SERIOUSLY NEGLECTED IF NOT
MikedeGruy_2010Z THE TERM DEEP SIX COMES TO MIND IF IT'S TOO BIG OR TOO TOXIC FOR A LANDFILL DEEP SIX IT SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALSO KEEP SOME OF THESE HOPE SPOTS IN THE DEEP SEA NOW
MikedeGruy_2010Z I DON'T GET A WISH BUT I CERTAINLY CAN SAY THAT I WILL DO ANYTHING I CAN TO SUPPORT SYLVIA EARLE 'S WISH AND THAT I DO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
