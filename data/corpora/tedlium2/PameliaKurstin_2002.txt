PameliaKurstin_2002@340.89:345.30 USUALLY WHEN I PLAY OUT THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE SCREAM OUT
PameliaKurstin_2002@361.24:365.68 AND THEN LIKE AND IT 'S I'M SURE YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WELL HOW DOES THIS THING
PameliaKurstin_2002@367.23:376.38 WELL WHAT I'M DOING IS OH CONTROLLING THE PITCH WITH MY LEFT HAND
PameliaKurstin_2002@389.01:394.23 WITH THIS HAND I'M CONTROLLING THE VOLUME SO THE FURTHER AWAY MY RIGHT HAND GETS THE
PameliaKurstin_2002@423.80:428.49 SOMETIMES I STARTLE MYSELF I'LL FORGET THAT I HAVE IT ON AND I'LL LEAN OVER TO PICK UP SOMETHING
PameliaKurstin_2002@443.93:445.71 GO INTO THE NEXT TUNE BECAUSE I

PameliaKurstin_2002@643.56:644.16 TO
PameliaKurstin_2002@647.13:653.76 THINK OF SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE COMMONLY ASKED THERE ARE SO MANY AND WELL I GUESS I COULD TELL YOU A LITTLE OF THE HISTORY
PameliaKurstin_2002@654.82:660.42 IT WAS INVENTED AROUND THE NINETEEN TWENTIES AND
PameliaKurstin_2002@662.67:670.43 HE ALSO IS A MUSICIAN BESIDES AN INVENTOR HE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA FOR MAKING THE THEREMIN
PameliaKurstin_2002@670.47:677.24 I THINK WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON SOME SHORTWAVE RADIOS AND THERE'D BE THAT SOUND IN THE SIGNAL IT'S LIKE
PameliaKurstin_2002@678.45:691.53 AND HE THOUGHT OH WHAT IF I COULD CONTROL THAT SOUND AND TURN IT INTO AN INSTRUMENT BECAUSE THERE ARE PITCHES IN IT AND SO SOMEHOW THROUGH DEVELOPING THAT HE EVENTUALLY CAME TO MAKE THE THEREMIN THE WAY IT IS NOW
PameliaKurstin_2002@692.59:693.27 AND
PameliaKurstin_2002@696.78:700.76 A LOT OF TIMES EVEN KIDS NOWADAYS THEY'LL MAKE REFERENCE TO
PameliaKurstin_2002@715.15:721.80 THE FUNNY GOOGLY SOUND THEY DO AND SOMETIMES IF I HAVE TOO MUCH COFFEE THEN MY VIBRATO GETS OUT OF HAND

PameliaKurstin_2002@730.82:739.23 IT REMINDS ME OF THE BALANCING ACT EARLIER ON WHAT MICHAEL WAS DOING BECAUSE YOU'RE FIGHTING SO HARD TO KEEP THE BALANCE WITH
PameliaKurstin_2002@739.98:747.48 WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING WITH AND STAY IN TUNE AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU DON'T WANT TO FOCUS SO MUCH ON BEING IN TUNE ALL THE TIME
PameliaKurstin_2002@747.89:755.28 YOU WANT TO BE FEELING THE MUSIC AND THEN ALSO YOU'RE TRYING TO STAY VERY VERY VERY STILL BECAUSE
PameliaKurstin_2002@755.88:761.60 LITTLE MOVEMENTS WITH OTHER PARTS OF YOUR BODY WILL AFFECT THE PITCH OR SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE HOLDING
PameliaKurstin_2002@774.62:786.59 IT'S DEFINITELY I THINK OF IT ALMOST LIKE LIKE A YOGA INSTRUMENT BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU SO AWARE OF EVERY LITTLE CRAZY THING YOUR BODY IS DOING OR
PameliaKurstin_2002@800.13:802.41 WELL I'M ABOUT TO GO ON SOON I DON'T WANT TO BE
