SebastianThrun_2011@40.75:54.23 I SAW THE CONCEPT FIRST IN THE DARPA GRAND CHALLENGES WHERE THE U S GOVERNMENT ISSUED A PRIZE TO BUILD A SELF DRIVING CAR THAT COULD NAVIGATE A DESERT AND EVEN THOUGH A HUNDRED TEAMS WERE THERE THESE CARS WENT NOWHERE

SebastianThrun_2011@63.99:66.29 AND WE SET IT FREE IN THE DESERT
SebastianThrun_2011@66.61:69.41 AND THE UNIMAGINABLE HAPPENED IT BECAME THE FIRST CAR
