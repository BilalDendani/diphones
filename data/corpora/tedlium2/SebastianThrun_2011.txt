SebastianThrun_2011 I LOVED CARS WHEN I TURNED EIGHTEEN I LOST MY BEST FRIEND TO A CAR ACCIDENT
SebastianThrun_2011 TO SAVING ONE MILLION PEOPLE
SebastianThrun_2011 EVERY YEAR NOW I HAVEN 'T SUCCEEDED SO THIS IS JUST A PROGRESS REPORT BUT I 'M HERE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SELF DRIVING CARS
SebastianThrun_2011 I SAW THE CONCEPT FIRST IN THE DARPA GRAND CHALLENGES WHERE THE U S GOVERNMENT ISSUED A PRIZE TO BUILD A SELF DRIVING CAR THAT COULD NAVIGATE A DESERT AND EVEN THOUGH A HUNDRED TEAMS WERE THERE THESE CARS WENT NOWHERE
SebastianThrun_2011 SO WE DECIDED AT STANFORD TO BUILD A DIFFERENT SELF DRIVING CAR WE BUILT THE HARDWARE AND THE SOFTWARE
SebastianThrun_2011 WE MADE IT LEARN FROM US
SebastianThrun_2011 AND WE SET IT FREE IN THE DESERT
SebastianThrun_2011 AND THE UNIMAGINABLE HAPPENED IT BECAME THE FIRST CAR
SebastianThrun_2011 TWO MILLION DOLLARS
SebastianThrun_2011 ON BUILDING DRIVING CARS THAT CAN DRIVE ANYWHERE BY THEMSELVES ANY STREET IN CALIFORNIA WE 'VE DRIVEN ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND MILES
SebastianThrun_2011 IT 'S THE PERFECT DRIVING MECHANISM
SebastianThrun_2011 WE 'VE DRIVEN IN CITIES LIKE IN SAN FRANCISCO HERE WE 'VE DRIVEN FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LOS ANGELES ON HIGHWAY ONE WE 'VE ENCOUNTERED JOGGERS
SebastianThrun_2011 BUSY HIGHWAYS TOLL BOOTHS
SebastianThrun_2011 AND THIS IS WITHOUT A PERSON IN THE LOOP THE CAR JUST DRIVES ITSELF IN FACT WHILE WE DROVE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND MILES
SebastianThrun_2011 PEOPLE DIDN 'T EVEN NOTICE
SebastianThrun_2011 MOUNTAIN ROADS DAY AND NIGHT
SebastianThrun_2011 AND EVEN CROOKED LOMBARD STREET IN SAN FRANCISCO
SebastianThrun_2011 BUT I CAN DO SOMETHING FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO DIED DO YOU KNOW THAT DRIVING ACCIDENTS ARE THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
SebastianThrun_2011 AND DO YOU REALIZE THAT ALMOST ALL OF THOSE ARE DUE TO HUMAN ERROR
SebastianThrun_2011 AND NOT MACHINE ERROR AND CAN THEREFORE BE PREVENTED BY MACHINES
SebastianThrun_2011 DO YOU REALIZE THAT YOU TED USERS SPEND AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY TWO MINUTES PER DAY IN TRAFFIC WASTING YOUR TIME ON YOUR DAILY COMMUTE
SebastianThrun_2011 YOU COULD REGAIN THIS TIME THIS IS FOUR BILLION HOURS WASTED IN THIS COUNTRY ALONE
