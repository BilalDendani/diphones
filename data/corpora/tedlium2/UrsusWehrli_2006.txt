UrsusWehrli_2006 MY NAME IS URSUS WEHRLI AND I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU THIS MORNING ABOUT MY PROJECT TIDYING UP ART FIRST OF ALL ANY QUESTIONS SO FAR
UrsusWehrli_2006 FIRST OF ALL I HAVE TO SAY I'M NOT FROM AROUND HERE I'M FROM A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CULTURAL AREA MAYBE YOU NOTICED I MEAN I'M WEARING A TIE
UrsusWehrli_2006 FIRST AND THEN SECONDLY I'M
UrsusWehrli_2006 LITTLE BIT NERVOUS BECAUSE I'M SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR ANY MISTAKES I MIGHT MAKE BECAUSE I'M FROM SWITZERLAND
UrsusWehrli_2006 AND I JUST DON'T HOPE YOU THINK THIS IS SWISS GERMAN I'M SPEAKING NOW HERE THIS IS JUST WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE IF WE SWISS TRY TO SPEAK AMERICAN
UrsusWehrli_2006 BUT DON'T WORRY I DON'T HAVE TROUBLE WITH ENGLISH AS SUCH I MEAN IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM IT'S YOUR LANGUAGE
UrsusWehrli_2006 I AM FINE AFTER THIS PRESENTATION HERE AT TED I CAN SIMPLY GO BACK TO SWITZERLAND AND YOU HAVE TO GO ON TALKING LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME
UrsusWehrli_2006 I'VE BEEN ASKED BY THE ORGANIZERS TO READ FROM MY BOOK IT'S CALLED TIDYING UP ART AND IT 'S AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S MORE OR LESS A PICTURE BOOK SO THE READING WOULD BE OVER VERY QUICKLY
UrsusWehrli_2006 SINCE I'M HERE A TED I DECIDED TO HOLD MY TALK HERE IN A MORE MODERN WAY IN THE SPIRIT OF TED HERE AND I MANAGED TO DO SOME SLIDES HERE FOR YOU I'D LIKE TO SHOW THEM AROUND SO WE
UrsusWehrli_2006 ACTUALLY I MANAGED TO PREPARE FOR YOU SOME ENLARGED PICTURES EVEN BETTER SO TIDYING UP ART I MEAN I HAVE TO SAY THAT'S A RELATIVELY NEW TERM YOU WON 'T BE FAMILIAR WITH
UrsusWehrli_2006 IT'S A HOBBY OF MINE THAT I'VE BEEN INDULGING IN FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS AND IT ALL STARTED OUT WITH THIS PICTURE OF THE AMERICAN ARTIST DONALD BAECHLER I HAD HANGING AT HOME
UrsusWehrli_2006 I HAD TO LOOK AT IT EVERY DAY AND AFTER A WHILE I JUST COULDN'T STAND THE MESS ANYMORE THIS GUY WAS LOOKING AT ALL DAY LONG
UrsusWehrli_2006 I KIND OF FELT SORRY FOR HIM AND IT SEEMED TO ME EVEN HE FELT REALLY BAD FACING THESE
UrsusWehrli_2006 RED SQUARES DAY AFTER DAY SO I DECIDED TO GIVE HIM A LITTLE SUPPORT
UrsusWehrli_2006 AND BROUGHT SOME ORDER INTO NEATLY STACKING THE BLOCKS ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
UrsusWehrli_2006 IT WAS GREAT WITH THIS EXPERIENCE I STARTED TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT MODERN ART THEN I REALIZED HOW YOU KNOW
UrsusWehrli_2006 WORLD OF MODERN ART IS PARTICULARLY TOPSY TURVY AND I CAN SHOW YOU A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE IT'S ACTUALLY A SIMPLE ONE BUT IT'S A GOOD ONE TO START WITH IT'S A PICTURE BY PAUL KLEE
UrsusWehrli_2006 THE ARTIST DOESN'T REALLY SEEM TO KNOW WHERE TO PUT THE DIFFERENT COLORS
UrsusWehrli_2006 THE VARIOUS PICTURES HERE OF THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE PICTURE THE WHOLE THING IS UNSTRUCTURED WE DON'T KNOW MAYBE MISTER KLEE WAS PROBABLY IN A HURRY
UrsusWehrli_2006 MAYBE HE HAD TO CATCH A PLANE OR SOMETHING WE CAN SEE HERE HE STARTED OUT WITH ORANGE AND THEN HE ALREADY RAN OUT OF ORANGE
UrsusWehrli_2006 HERE WE CAN SEE HE DECIDED TO TAKE A BREAK FOR A SQUARE AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU HERE MY TIDIED UP VERSION OF THIS PICTURE
UrsusWehrli_2006 WE CAN SEE NOW WHAT WAS BARELY RECOGNIZABLE IN THE ORIGINAL
UrsusWehrli_2006 THAT'S GREAT SO I MEAN
UrsusWehrli_2006 THAT'S JUST TIDYING UP FOR BEGINNERS I WOULD LIKE TO YOU SEE A PICTURE WHICH IS A BIT MORE
UrsusWehrli_2006 WHAT CAN YOU SAY WHAT A MESS I MEAN
UrsusWehrli_2006 SEE EVERYTHING SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SCATTERED AIMLESSLY AROUND THE SPACE
UrsusWehrli_2006 IF MY ROOM BACK HOME HAD LOOKED THIS MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE GROUNDED ME FOR THREE DAYS SO I'D LIKE I'D LIKE TO REINTRODUCE SOME STRUCTURE INTO THAT PICTURE
UrsusWehrli_2006 WE SWISS ARE FAMOUS FOR CHOCOLATE AND CHEESE OUR TRAINS RUN ON TIME WE ARE ONLY HAPPY WHEN THINGS ARE IN ORDER BUT TO GO ON
UrsusWehrli_2006 HERE IS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE TO SEE THIS IS A PICTURE BY JOAN MIRO AND YEAH WE CAN SEE THE ARTIST HAS DRAWN A FEW LINES AND SHAPES AND DROPPED THEM ANY OLD WAY ONTO A YELLOW BACKGROUND
UrsusWehrli_2006 AND YEAH IT'S THE SORT OF THING YOU PRODUCE WHEN YOU'RE DOODLING ON THE PHONE AND
UrsusWehrli_2006 MY
UrsusWehrli_2006 THE WHOLE THING TAKES UP FAR LESS SPACE IT'S MORE ECONOMICAL AND ALSO MORE EFFICIENT WITH THIS METHOD MISTER MIRO COULD HAVE SAVED CANVAS FOR ANOTHER PICTURE
UrsusWehrli_2006 I CAN SEE IN YOUR FACES THAT YOU'RE STILL A LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL SO THAT YOU CAN JUST APPRECIATE HOW SERIOUS I AM ABOUT ALL THIS I BROUGHT ALONG THE PATENTS THE SPECIFICATIONS FOR SOME OF THESE WORKS
UrsusWehrli_2006 WELL I COULD HAVE TRANSLATED THAT BUT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN NONE THE WISER I'M NOT SURE MYSELF WHAT IT MEANS BUT IT SOUNDS GOOD ANYWAY I JUST
UrsusWehrli_2006 IT'S IMPORTANT HOW ONE INTRODUCES NEW IDEAS TO PEOPLE THAT'S WHY THIS PATENT ARE SOMETIMES NECESSARY
UrsusWehrli_2006 I WOULD LIKE TO DO A SHORT TEST WITH YOU EVERYONE IS SITTING IN QUITE AN ORDERLY FASHION HERE THIS MORNING SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU ALL TO RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND
UrsusWehrli_2006 THE RIGHT HAND IS THE ONE WE WRITE WITH APART FROM THE LEFT HANDERS
UrsusWehrli_2006 AND NOW I'LL COUNT TO THREE I MEAN IT STILL LOOKS VERY ORDERLY TO ME NOW I'LL COUNT TO THREE AND ON THE COUNT OF THREE I'D LIKE YOU ALL TO SHAKE HAND WITH THE PERSON BEHIND YOU OK ONE TWO THREE
UrsusWehrli_2006 CLEARLY IN THIS NEXT PAINTING THIS IS A PAINTING BY THE ARTIST NIKI DE
UrsusWehrli_2006 AND I MEAN IN THE ORIGINAL IT'S COMPLETELY UNCLEAR TO SEE WHAT THIS TANGLE OF COLORS AND SHAPES IS SUPPOSED TO DEPICT
UrsusWehrli_2006 BUT IN THE TIDIED UP VERSION IT'S PLAIN TO SEE THAT IT'S A SUNBURNT WOMAN PLAYING VOLLEYBALL
UrsusWehrli_2006 THIS ONE HERE THAT'S MUCH BETTER THAT'S A PICTURE BY KEITH HARING
UrsusWehrli_2006 I THINK IT DOESN'T MATTER
UrsusWehrli_2006 SO I MEAN THIS PICTURE HAS NOT EVEN GOT A PROPER TITLE IT'S CALLED
UrsusWehrli_2006 AND I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE
UrsusWehrli_2006 SO IN THE TIDIED UP VERSION WE HAVE A SORT OF KEITH HARING SPARE PARTS SHOP
UrsusWehrli_2006 THIS IS KEITH HARING LOOKED AT STATISTICALLY ONE CAN SEE HERE QUITE CLEARLY YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE PALE GREEN ELEMENTS
UrsusWehrli_2006 OF WHICH ONE IS IN THE FORM OF A CIRCLE OR HERE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE TWENTY SEVEN PINK SQUARES WITH ONLY ONE PINK CURVE
UrsusWehrli_2006 I MEAN THAT'S INTERESTING ONE COULD EXTEND THIS SORT OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS TO COVER ALL MISTER HARING 'S VARIOUS WORKS IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH IN WHICH PERIOD THE ARTIST FAVORED PALE GREEN CIRCLES OR PINK SQUARES
UrsusWehrli_2006 AND THE ARTIST HIMSELF COULD ALSO BENEFIT FROM THIS SORT OF LISTING PROCEDURE BY USING IT TO ESTIMATE HOW MANY POTS OF PAINT HE 'S LIKELY TO NEED IN THE FUTURE
UrsusWehrli_2006 ONE CAN OBVIOUSLY ALSO MAKE COMBINATIONS FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE KEITH HARING CIRCLES AND KANDINSKY 'S DOTS YOU CAN ADD THEM TO ALL THE SQUARES OF PAUL KLEE
UrsusWehrli_2006 IN THE END ONE HAS A LIST WITH WHICH ONE THEN CAN ARRANGE THEN YOU CATEGORIZE IT THEN YOU FILE IT PUT THAT FILE IN A FILING CABINET PUT IT IN YOUR OFFICE
UrsusWehrli_2006 AND YOU CAN MAKE A LIVING DOING IT
UrsusWehrli_2006 MY OWN EXPERIENCE SO
UrsusWehrli_2006 ACTUALLY I MEAN WE HAVE ARTISTS THAT ARE A BIT MORE STRUCTURED IT'S NOT TOO BAD THIS IS JASPER JOHNS WE CAN SEE HERE HE WAS PRACTICING WITH HIS RULER
UrsusWehrli_2006 I THINK IT COULD STILL BENEFIT FROM MORE DISCIPLINE
UrsusWehrli_2006 AND I THINK THE WHOLE THING ADDS UP MUCH BETTER IF YOU DO IT LIKE THIS
UrsusWehrli_2006 AND HERE THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES
UrsusWehrli_2006 UP RENE MAGRITTE THIS IS REALLY FUN YOU KNOW
UrsusWehrli_2006 ASKED WHAT INSPIRED ME TO EMBARK ON ALL THIS IT GOES BACK TO A TIME WHEN I WAS VERY OFTEN STAYING IN HOTELS SO ONCE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY IN A RITZY FIVE STAR HOTEL AND YOU KNOW THERE YOU HAD THIS LITTLE SIGN
UrsusWehrli_2006 SO AFTER A WHILE I DECIDED TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN AND BEFORE LEAVING THE ROOM EACH DAY I'D SCATTER A FEW THINGS AROUND THE SPACE
UrsusWehrli_2006 LIKE BOOKS CLOTHES TOOTHBRUSH ET CETERA AND IT WAS GREAT BY THE TIME I RETURNED EVERYTHING HAD ALWAYS BEEN NEATLY RETURNED TO ITS PLACE
UrsusWehrli_2006 THEN ONE MORNING I HANG THE SAME LITTLE SIGN ONTO THAT PICTURE BY VINCENT VAN GOGH
UrsusWehrli_2006 AND WHEN I RETURNED IT LOOKED LIKE THIS
UrsusWehrli_2006 AT LEAST IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO DO SOME VACUUMING
UrsusWehrli_2006 I MEAN I CAN SEE THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE THAT LIKE REACTING THAT ONE OR ANOTHER PICTURE HASN'T BEEN PROPERLY TIDIED UP SO
UrsusWehrli_2006 WE CAN MAKE A SHORT TEST WITH YOU THIS IS A PICTURE BY RENE MAGRITTE AND I'D LIKE YOU ALL
UrsusWehrli_2006 TO INWARDLY LIKE IN YOUR HEAD THAT IS TO TIDY THAT UP
UrsusWehrli_2006 SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF YOU WOULD MAKE IT LIKE THIS
UrsusWehrli_2006 I WOULD ACTUALLY PREFER TO DO IT
UrsusWehrli_2006 SOME PEOPLE WOULD MAKE APPLE PIE OUT OF IT BUT IT'S A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE TO SEE THAT THE WHOLE WORK WAS MORE OF A HANDICRAFT ENDEAVOR THAT INVOLVED THE VERY TIME CONSUMING
UrsusWehrli_2006 CUTTING OUT THE VARIOUS AND ELEMENTS STICKING THEM BACK IN NEW ARRANGEMENTS AND IT'S NOT DONE AS MANY PEOPLE IMAGINE WITH THE COMPUTER OTHERWISE
UrsusWehrli_2006 IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS
UrsusWehrli_2006 NOW I'VE BEEN ABLE TO TIDY UP PICTURES THAT I'VE WANTED TO TIDY UP FOR A LONG TIME HERE IS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE TAKE JACKSON POLLOCK FOR EXAMPLE IT'S
UrsusWehrli_2006 THAT'S A REALLY HARD ONE BUT AFTER A WHILE I JUST DECIDED HERE TO GO ALL THE WAY AND PUT THE PAINT BACK INTO THE
UrsusWehrli_2006 YOU COULD GO INTO
UrsusWehrli_2006 HERE WE HAVE THE FUR CUP BY MERET OPPENHEIM
UrsusWehrli_2006 HERE I JUST BROUGHT IT BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL STATE
UrsusWehrli_2006 AND IT'S GREAT YOU CAN EVEN GO YOU KNOW OR WE HAVE THIS POINTILIST MOVEMENT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE INTO ART THE POINTILIST MOVEMENT IS THAT KIND OF PAINTINGS
UrsusWehrli_2006 WHERE EVERYTHING IS BROKEN DOWN INTO DOTS AND PIXELS AND THEN I THIS SORT OF THING IS IDEAL FOR TIDYING UP SO I ONCE
UrsusWehrli_2006 APPLIED MYSELF TO THE WORK OF THE INVENTOR OF THAT METHOD GEORGES SEURAT AND I COLLECTED TOGETHER ALL HIS DOTS AND NOW THEY'RE ALL IN HERE
UrsusWehrli_2006 IT'S THE FUTURE WE WILL CREATE
UrsusWehrli_2006 BUT TO ROUND THINGS UP I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU JUST ONE MORE
UrsusWehrli_2006 THIS IS THE VILLAGE SQUARE BY
UrsusWehrli_2006 YEAH MAYBE YOU'RE ASKING YOURSELVES WHERE OLD BRUGEL 'S PEOPLE WENT OF COURSE THEY'RE NOT GONE THEY'RE ALL HERE
UrsusWehrli_2006 JUST PILED THEM UP
UrsusWehrli_2006 AND I'M HAPPY TO SIGN IT FOR YOU WITH ANY NAME OF ANY ARTIST
UrsusWehrli_2006 BUT BEFORE LEAVING I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU I'M WORKING RIGHT NOW
UrsusWehrli_2006 ANOTHER IN A RELATED FIELD WITH MY TIDYING UP ART METHOD I'M WORKING IN A RELATED FIELD AND I STARTED TO BRING SOME ORDER INTO
UrsusWehrli_2006 JUST MY NEW PROPOSAL HERE FOR THE UNION JACK
UrsusWehrli_2006 AND THEN MAYBE BEFORE I LEAVE YOU
UrsusWehrli_2006 YEAH I THINK AFTER YOU HAVE SEEN THAT I HAVE TO LEAVE ANYWAY
UrsusWehrli_2006 THAT WAS A HARD ONE I COULDN'T FIND A WAY TO TIDY THAT UP PROPERLY SO I JUST DECIDED TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE SIMPLER
