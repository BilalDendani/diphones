AndrewMcAfee_2013@30.44:36.72 I 'M GOING TO IGNORE THEIR CAUTIONS AND MAKE ONE VERY SPECIFIC FORECAST IN THE WORLD THAT WE ARE CREATING VERY QUICKLY
AndrewMcAfee_2013@65.53:72.04 AROUND WAREHOUSES WHICH MEANS WE NEED A LOT FEWER PEOPLE TO BE WALKING UP AND DOWN THOSE AISLES NOW
AndrewMcAfee_2013@72.06:79.84 FOR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YEARS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING EXACTLY WHAT I 'M TELLING YOU THE AGE OF TECHNOLOGICAL UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT HAND
AndrewMcAfee_2013@79.84:95.41 STARTING WITH THE LUDDITES SMASHING LOOMS IN BRITAIN JUST ABOUT TWO CENTURIES AGO AND THEY HAVE BEEN WRONG OUR ECONOMIES IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD HAVE COASTED ALONG ON SOMETHING PRETTY CLOSE TO FULL EMPLOYMENT WHICH BRINGS UP A CRITICAL QUESTION WHY IS THIS TIME DIFFERENT IF IT REALLY IS
AndrewMcAfee_2013@95.41:108.92 THE REASON IT 'S DIFFERENT IS THAT JUST IN THE PAST FEW YEARS OUR MACHINES HAVE STARTED DEMONSTRATING SKILLS THEY HAVE NEVER EVER HAD BEFORE UNDERSTANDING SPEAKING HEARING SEEING ANSWERING WRITING AND
AndrewMcAfee_2013@108.92:120.8 THEY 'RE STILL ACQUIRING NEW SKILLS FOR EXAMPLE MOBILE HUMANOID ROBOTS ARE STILL INCREDIBLY PRIMITIVE BUT THE RESEARCH ARM OF THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT JUST LAUNCHED A COMPETITION TO HAVE THEM DO THINGS LIKE THIS
AndrewMcAfee_2013@120.8:134.03 AND IF THE TRACK RECORD IS ANY GUIDE THIS COMPETITION IS GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO WHEN I LOOK AROUND I THINK THE DAY IS NOT TOO FAR OFF AT ALL WHEN WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE ANDROIDS DOING A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW
AndrewMcAfee_2013@134.03:143.45 AND WE 'RE CREATING A WORLD WHERE THERE IS GOING TO BE MORE AND MORE TECHNOLOGY AND FEWER AND FEWER JOBS IT 'S A WORLD THAT ERIK BRYNJOLFSSON AND I ARE CALLING
AndrewMcAfee_2013@143.45:155.89 THE NEW MACHINE AGE THE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT NEWS THIS IS THE BEST ECONOMIC NEWS ON THE PLANET THESE DAYS NOT THAT THERE 'S A LOT OF COMPETITION RIGHT
AndrewMcAfee_2013@156.23:169.31 THIS IS THE BEST ECONOMIC NEWS WE HAVE THESE DAYS FOR TWO MAIN REASONS THE FIRST IS TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS IS WHAT ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE THIS AMAZING RECENT RUN THAT WE 'RE ON WHERE OUTPUT GOES UP OVER TIME
AndrewMcAfee_2013@169.53:172.3 WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PRICES GO DOWN
AndrewMcAfee_2013@172.32:176.09 AND VOLUME AND QUALITY JUST CONTINUE TO
AndrewMcAfee_2013@176.09:188.17 NOW SOME PEOPLE LOOK AT THIS AND TALK ABOUT SHALLOW MATERIALISM BUT THAT 'S ABSOLUTELY THE WRONG WAY TO LOOK AT IT THIS IS ABUNDANCE WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM TO PROVIDE
AndrewMcAfee_2013@188.32:192.87 THE SECOND REASON THAT THE NEW MACHINE AGE IS SUCH GREAT NEWS
AndrewMcAfee_2013@192.87:212.38 IS THAT ONCE THE ANDROIDS START DOING JOBS WE DON 'T HAVE TO DO THEM ANYMORE AND WE GET FREED UP FROM DRUDGERY AND TOIL NOW WHEN I TALK ABOUT THIS WITH MY FRIENDS IN CAMBRIDGE AND SILICON VALLEY THEY SAY FANTASTIC NO MORE DRUDGERY NO MORE TOIL THIS GIVES US THE CHANCE TO IMAGINE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT KIND OF SOCIETY
AndrewMcAfee_2013@212.38:215.46 A SOCIETY WHERE THE CREATORS AND THE DISCOVERERS AND THE
AndrewMcAfee_2013@215.46:224.54 PERFORMERS AND THE INNOVATORS COME TOGETHER WITH THEIR PATRONS AND THEIR FINANCIERS TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES ENTERTAIN ENLIGHTEN PROVOKE EACH OTHER
AndrewMcAfee_2013@224.85:227.02 IT 'S A SOCIETY REALLY THAT
AndrewMcAfee_2013@227.03:229.75 LOOKS A LOT LIKE THE TED CONFERENCE
AndrewMcAfee_2013@230.21:233.22 AND THERE 'S ACTUALLY A HUGE AMOUNT OF TRUTH HERE WE ARE SEEING
AndrewMcAfee_2013@233.22:252.02 AN AMAZING FLOURISHING TAKING PLACE IN A WORLD WHERE IT IS JUST ABOUT AS EASY TO GENERATE AN OBJECT AS IT IS TO PRINT A DOCUMENT WE HAVE AMAZING NEW POSSIBILITIES THE PEOPLE WHO USED TO BE CRAFTSMEN AND HOBBYISTS ARE NOW MAKERS AND THEY 'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF INNOVATION AND ARTISTS WHO WERE
AndrewMcAfee_2013@252.02:257.74 FORMERLY CONSTRAINED CAN NOW DO THINGS THAT WERE NEVER EVER POSSIBLE FOR THEM BEFORE
AndrewMcAfee_2013@257.84:275.97 SO THIS IS A TIME OF GREAT FLOURISHING AND THE MORE I LOOK AROUND THE MORE CONVINCED I BECOME THAT THIS QUOTE FROM THE PHYSICIST FREEMAN DYSON IS NOT HYPERBOLE AT ALL THIS IS JUST A PLAIN STATEMENT OF THE FACTS WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ASTONISHING PERIOD TECHNOLOGY IS A GIFT OF GOD AFTER THE GIFT OF LIFE IT IS PERHAPS THE GREATEST OF GOD 'S GIFTS IT IS THE MOTHER OF CIVILIZATIONS OF ARTS AND OF SCIENCES FREEMAN DYSON WHICH BRINGS UP ANOTHER GREAT QUESTION
AndrewMcAfee_2013@276.52:287.77 WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG IN THIS NEW MACHINE AGE RIGHT GREAT HANG UP FLOURISH GO HOME WE 'RE GOING TO FACE TWO REALLY THORNY SETS OF CHALLENGES AS WE HEAD DEEPER INTO THE FUTURE THAT WE 'RE
AndrewMcAfee_2013@324.69:336.66 AND WE SEE THIS VERY CLEARLY IN THE STATISTICS IF YOU LOOK OVER THE PAST COUPLE DECADES AT THE RETURNS TO CAPITAL IN OTHER WORDS CORPORATE PROFITS WE SEE THEM GOING UP AND WE SEE THAT THEY 'RE NOW AT AN ALL TIME HIGH
AndrewMcAfee_2013@336.66:352.04 IF WE LOOK AT THE RETURNS TO LABOR IN OTHER WORDS TOTAL WAGES PAID OUT IN THE ECONOMY WE SEE THEM AT AN ALL TIME LOW AND HEADING VERY QUICKLY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION SO THIS IS CLEARLY BAD NEWS FOR REUTHER IT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE GREAT NEWS FOR FORD
AndrewMcAfee_2013@352.17:357.77 BUT IT 'S ACTUALLY NOT IF YOU WANT TO SELL HUGE VOLUMES OF SOMEWHAT EXPENSIVE GOODS TO PEOPLE
AndrewMcAfee_2013@357.77:366.31 YOU REALLY WANT A LARGE STABLE PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS WE HAVE HAD ONE OF THOSE IN AMERICA FOR JUST ABOUT THE ENTIRE POSTWAR PERIOD
AndrewMcAfee_2013@366.31:382.25 BUT THE MIDDLE CLASS IS CLEARLY UNDER HUGE THREAT RIGHT NOW WE ALL KNOW A LOT OF THE STATISTICS BUT JUST TO REPEAT ONE OF THEM MEDIAN INCOME IN AMERICA HAS ACTUALLY GONE DOWN OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS AND WE 'RE IN DANGER OF GETTING TRAPPED IN SOME VICIOUS CYCLE
AndrewMcAfee_2013@382.25:386.93 WHERE INEQUALITY AND POLARIZATION CONTINUE TO GO UP OVER TIME
AndrewMcAfee_2013@387.47:401.76 THE SOCIETAL CHALLENGES THAT COME ALONG WITH THAT KIND OF INEQUALITY DESERVE SOME ATTENTION THERE ARE A SET OF SOCIETAL CHALLENGES THAT I 'M ACTUALLY NOT THAT WORRIED ABOUT AND THEY 'RE CAPTURED BY IMAGES LIKE THIS THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF SOCIETAL PROBLEM THAT I AM
AndrewMcAfee_2013@401.76:411.72 CONCERNED ABOUT THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF DYSTOPIAN VISIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN OUR MACHINES BECOME SELF AWARE AND THEY DECIDE TO RISE UP AND COORDINATE ATTACKS AGAINST US
AndrewMcAfee_2013@411.72:417.16 I 'M GOING TO START WORRYING ABOUT THOSE THE DAY MY COMPUTER BECOMES AWARE OF MY PRINTER
AndrewMcAfee_2013@420.72:432.11 SO THIS IS NOT THE SET OF CHALLENGES WE REALLY NEED TO WORRY ABOUT TO TELL YOU THE KINDS OF SOCIETAL CHALLENGES THAT ARE GOING TO COME UP IN THE NEW MACHINE AGE I WANT TO TELL A STORY ABOUT TWO STEREOTYPICAL AMERICAN WORKERS
AndrewMcAfee_2013@432.11:442.58 AND TO MAKE THEM REALLY STEREOTYPICAL LET 'S MAKE THEM BOTH WHITE GUYS AND THE FIRST ONE IS A COLLEGE EDUCATED PROFESSIONAL CREATIVE TYPE MANAGER
AndrewMcAfee_2013@442.58:447.58 ENGINEER DOCTOR LAWYER THAT KIND OF WORKER WE 'RE GOING TO CALL HIM TED
AndrewMcAfee_2013@447.78:461.34 HE 'S AT THE TOP OF THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS HIS COUNTERPART IS NOT COLLEGE EDUCATED AND WORKS AS A LABORER WORKS AS A CLERK DOES LOW LEVEL WHITE COLLAR OR BLUE COLLAR WORK IN THE ECONOMY WE 'RE GOING TO CALL THAT GUY BILL
AndrewMcAfee_2013@461.68:479.52 AND IF YOU GO BACK ABOUT FIFTY YEARS BILL AND TED WERE LEADING REMARKABLY SIMILAR LIVES FOR EXAMPLE IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THEY WERE BOTH VERY LIKELY TO HAVE FULL TIME JOBS WORKING AT LEAST FORTY HOURS A WEEK BUT AS THE SOCIAL RESEARCHER CHARLES MURRAY HAS DOCUMENTED AS WE STARTED TO AUTOMATE
AndrewMcAfee_2013@490.05:502.54 THE FORTUNES OF BILL AND TED DIVERGED A LOT OVER THIS TIME FRAME TED HAS CONTINUED TO HOLD A FULL TIME JOB BILL HASN 'T IN MANY CASES BILL HAS LEFT THE ECONOMY ENTIRELY AND TED
AndrewMcAfee_2013@502.54:507.31 VERY RARELY HAS OVER TIME TED 'S MARRIAGE HAS STAYED QUITE HAPPY
AndrewMcAfee_2013@521.63:537.84 AND HE 'S STARTED TO GO TO PRISON A LOT MORE OFTEN SO I CANNOT TELL A HAPPY STORY ABOUT THESE SOCIAL TRENDS AND THEY DON 'T SHOW ANY SIGNS OF REVERSING THEMSELVES THEY 'RE ALSO TRUE NO MATTER WHICH ETHNIC GROUP OR DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP WE LOOK AT AND THEY 'RE ACTUALLY
AndrewMcAfee_2013@537.84:552.1 GETTING SO SEVERE THAT THEY 'RE IN DANGER OF OVERWHELMING EVEN THE AMAZING PROGRESS WE MADE WITH THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND WHAT MY FRIENDS IN SILICON VALLEY AND CAMBRIDGE ARE OVERLOOKING IS THAT THEY 'RE TED
AndrewMcAfee_2013@552.25:554.59 THEY 'RE LIVING THESE AMAZINGLY BUSY
AndrewMcAfee_2013@554.59:564.98 PRODUCTIVE LIVES AND THEY 'VE GOT ALL THE BENEFITS TO SHOW FROM THAT WHILE BILL IS LEADING A VERY DIFFERENT LIFE THEY 'RE ACTUALLY BOTH PROOF OF HOW RIGHT VOLTAIRE WAS WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF WORK
AndrewMcAfee_2013@564.98:569.05 AND THE FACT THAT IT SAVES US FROM NOT ONE BUT THREE GREAT EVILS
AndrewMcAfee_2013@586.26:588.05 ENCOURAGE ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AndrewMcAfee_2013@588.5:602.98 DOUBLE DOWN ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND MAKE SURE WE 'RE TURNING OUT PEOPLE FROM OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WITH THE APPROPRIATE SKILLS BUT OVER THE LONGER TERM IF WE ARE MOVING INTO AN ECONOMY THAT 'S HEAVY ON TECHNOLOGY AND LIGHT ON LABOR AND WE ARE
AndrewMcAfee_2013@602.98:619.84 THEN WE HAVE TO CONSIDER SOME MORE RADICAL INTERVENTIONS FOR EXAMPLE SOMETHING LIKE A GUARANTEED MINIMUM INCOME NOW THAT 'S PROBABLY MAKING SOME FOLK IN THIS ROOM UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE THAT IDEA IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXTREME LEFT WING AND WITH FAIRLY RADICAL SCHEMES FOR REDISTRIBUTING WEALTH
AndrewMcAfee_2013@619.92:634.85 I DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH ON THIS NOTION AND IT MIGHT CALM SOME FOLK DOWN TO KNOW THAT THE IDEA OF A NET GUARANTEED MINIMUM INCOME HAS BEEN CHAMPIONED BY THOSE FROTHING AT THE MOUTH SOCIALISTS FRIEDRICH HAYEK RICHARD NIXON AND MILTON FRIEDMAN
AndrewMcAfee_2013@635.49:637.61 AND IF YOU FIND YOURSELF WORRIED
AndrewMcAfee_2013@664.68:682.77 FOR GETTING BILL TO ENGAGE AND STAY ENGAGED THROUGHOUT LIFE I DO KNOW THAT EDUCATION IS A HUGE PART OF IT I WITNESSED THIS FIRSTHAND I WAS A MONTESSORI KID FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF MY EDUCATION AND WHAT THAT EDUCATION TAUGHT ME IS THAT THE WORLD IS AN INTERESTING PLACE AND MY JOB IS TO GO EXPLORE IT
AndrewMcAfee_2013@690.86:707.49 WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT I NOW KNOW THE JOB WAS TO PREPARE ME FOR LIFE AS A CLERK OR A LABORER BUT AT THE TIME IT FELT LIKE THE JOB WAS TO KIND OF BORE ME INTO SOME SUBMISSION WITH WHAT WAS GOING ON AROUND ME WE HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THIS WE CANNOT KEEP TURNING OUT BILLS
AndrewMcAfee_2013@707.49:717.06 SO WE SEE SOME GREEN SHOOTS THAT THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER WE SEE TECHNOLOGY DEEPLY IMPACTING EDUCATION AND ENGAGING PEOPLE FROM OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS UP TO OUR OLDEST ONES
AndrewMcAfee_2013@717.06:733.45 WE SEE VERY PROMINENT BUSINESS VOICES TELLING US WE NEED TO RETHINK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE 'VE BEEN HOLDING DEAR FOR A WHILE AND WE SEE VERY SERIOUS AND SUSTAINED AND DATA DRIVEN EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO INTERVENE IN SOME OF THE MOST TROUBLED COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE SO THE GREEN SHOOTS ARE OUT THERE
AndrewMcAfee_2013@748.8:760.57 AND MY BIGGEST WORRY IS THAT WE 'RE CREATING A WORLD WHERE WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE GLITTERING TECHNOLOGIES EMBEDDED IN KIND OF A SHABBY SOCIETY AND SUPPORTED BY AN ECONOMY THAT GENERATES INEQUALITY INSTEAD OF OPPORTUNITY
AndrewMcAfee_2013@760.57:767.39 BUT I ACTUALLY DON 'T THINK THAT 'S WHAT WE 'RE GOING TO DO I THINK WE 'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING A LOT BETTER FOR ONE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD REASON
AndrewMcAfee_2013@767.39:782.03 FACTS ARE GETTING OUT THERE THE REALITIES OF THIS NEW MACHINE AGE AND THE CHANGE IN THE ECONOMY ARE BECOMING MORE WIDELY KNOWN IF WE WANTED TO ACCELERATE THAT PROCESS WE COULD DO THINGS LIKE HAVE OUR BEST ECONOMISTS AND POLICYMAKERS PLAY JEOPARDY AGAINST WATSON
AndrewMcAfee_2013@782.46:795.08 WE COULD SEND CONGRESS ON AN AUTONOMOUS CAR ROAD TRIP AND IF WE DO ENOUGH OF THESE KINDS OF THINGS THE AWARENESS IS GOING TO SINK IN THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT AND THEN WE 'RE OFF TO THE RACES BECAUSE I DON 'T BELIEVE FOR A SECOND
AndrewMcAfee_2013@795.19:811.47 THAT WE HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO SOLVE TOUGH CHALLENGES OR THAT WE HAVE BECOME TOO APATHETIC OR HARD HEARTED TO EVEN TRY I STARTED MY TALK WITH QUOTES FROM WORDSMITHS WHO WERE SEPARATED BY AN OCEAN AND A CENTURY LET ME END IT WITH WORDS FROM POLITICIANS WHO WERE SIMILARLY DISTANT
AndrewMcAfee_2013@811.47:826.91 WINSTON CHURCHILL CAME TO MY HOME OF MIT IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE AND HE SAID IF WE ARE TO BRING THE BROAD MASSES OF THE PEOPLE IN EVERY LAND TO THE TABLE OF ABUNDANCE IT CAN ONLY BE BY THE TIRELESS IMPROVEMENT OF ALL OF OUR MEANS OF TECHNICAL PRODUCTION
AndrewMcAfee_2013@826.91:836.82 ABRAHAM LINCOLN REALIZED THERE WAS ONE OTHER INGREDIENT HE SAID I AM A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE PEOPLE IF GIVEN THE TRUTH THEY CAN BE DEPENDED UPON TO MEET ANY NATIONAL CRISIS
