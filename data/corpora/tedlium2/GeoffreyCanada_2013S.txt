GeoffreyCanada_2013S@73.33:75.51 IT IS ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@78.38:80.52 THOSE OF US IN EDUCATION
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@102.79:105.39 I GREW UP IN THE INNER CITY
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@105.43:107.56 AND THERE WERE KIDS
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@116.61:119.43 AND THOSE SCHOOLS ARE STILL LOUSY TODAY
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@120.15:122.96 FIFTY SIX YEARS LATER
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@123.07:128.02 AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT A LOUSY SCHOOL IT 'S NOT LIKE A BOTTLE OF WINE
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@159.85:161.52 AND THEY SAY WE 'LL WE 'RE GOING TO DO
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@162.1:164.2 WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR THIS YEAR
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@164.96:166.89 WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS MODEL IS THAT
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@171.12:173.37 BETWEEN TEN AND THREE
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@187.26:190.02 WHO CREATED THAT BUSINESS MODEL
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@206.96:214.03 AND THEY DON 'T CARE WHETHER OR NOT GEOFF IS UPSET HE CAN 'T GO TO THE BANK GO FIND ANOTHER BANK THEY ALL OPERATE THE SAME WAY
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@233.87:240.12 SO I WAS A LITTLE SLOW AND I DID NOT TRUST TECHNOLOGY AND WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT WITH THOSE NEW CONTRAPTIONS
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@264.1:268.06 WHEN WE WERE HAVING FOLKS BEING CRIPPLED BY POLIO
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@271.37:273.58 THE SAME WAY THEN THAT WE 'RE DOING RIGHT NOW
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@309.03:310.63 WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@329.68:338.68 FOR YEARS I WENT TO LOOK I WENT THE HARVARD ED SCHOOL I THOUGHT I KNEW SOMETHING THEY SAID IT WAS THE AGRARIAN CALENDAR AND PEOPLE HAD BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHY THAT DOESN 'T MAKE SENSE

GeoffreyCanada_2013S@658.19:661.77 FORTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THOSE KIDS WERE ON GRADE LEVEL
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@662.67:668.74 AND I SAY OKAY WHAT 'S THE PLAN WHAT DID WE DO FROM LAST YEAR TO THIS YEAR YOU SAY WE 'RE DOING THE SAME THING I 'M GOING TO MAKE A PREDICTION

GeoffreyCanada_2013S@775.9:778.43 NOT A PERSON NOT A SOUL
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@783:786.84 THAT SHOULDN 'T STOP YOU FROM PUSHING THE SCIENCE FORWARD
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@786.87:791.28 OUR JOB AS EDUCATORS THERE 'S SOME STUFF WE KNOW THAT WE CAN DO
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@791.56:798.5 AND WE 'VE GOT TO DO BETTER THE EVALUATION WE HAVE TO START WITH KIDS EARLIER WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE THE SUPPORT TO YOUNG PEOPLE
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@798.61:801.7 WE 'VE GOT TO GIVE THEM ALL OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES SO
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@807.16:810.98 INNOVATING UNTIL WE REALLY NAIL THIS SCIENCE DOWN
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@811.06:815.11 IS SOMETHING THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND THIS IS SOMETHING BY THE WAY
GeoffreyCanada_2013S@815.35:818.73 THAT I THINK IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR OUR ENTIRE FIELD

GeoffreyCanada_2013S@887.22:892.77 WHAT IT WOULD REQUIRE FOR US TO REALLY BEGIN TO SOLVE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS
