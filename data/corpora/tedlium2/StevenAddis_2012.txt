StevenAddis_2012@13.29:16.25 MY PASSION EVER SINCE I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO PICK UP A CAMERA
StevenAddis_2012@16.7:19.29 BUT TODAY I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU
StevenAddis_2012@19.46:30.75 THE FIFTEEN MOST TREASURED PHOTOS OF MINE AND I DIDN 'T TAKE ANY OF THEM THERE WERE NO ART DIRECTORS NO STYLISTS NO CHANCE FOR RESHOOTS NOT EVEN ANY REGARD FOR LIGHTING
StevenAddis_2012@31.17:34.72 IN FACT MOST OF THEM WERE TAKEN BY RANDOM TOURISTS
StevenAddis_2012@35.82:37.34 MY STORY BEGINS
StevenAddis_2012@37.45:43.91 WHEN I WAS IN NEW YORK CITY FOR A SPEAKING ENGAGEMENT AND MY WIFE TOOK THIS PICTURE OF ME HOLDING MY DAUGHTER ON HER FIRST BIRTHDAY
StevenAddis_2012@64.38:73.59 THIS IS WHEN WE STARTED ASKING PASSING TOURISTS TO TAKE THE PICTURE YOU KNOW IT 'S REMARKABLE HOW UNIVERSAL THE GESTURE IS OF HANDING YOUR CAMERA TO A TOTAL STRANGER
StevenAddis_2012@73.76:77.7 NO ONE 'S EVER REFUSED AND LUCKILY NO ONE 'S EVER RUN OFF WITH OUR CAMERA
StevenAddis_2012@78.51:86.88 BACK THEN WE HAD NO IDEA HOW MUCH THIS TRIP WOULD CHANGE OUR LIVES IT 'S REALLY BECOME SACRED TO US THIS ONE WAS TAKEN JUST WEEKS AFTER NINE ELEVEN
StevenAddis_2012@87.2:93.64 AND I FOUND MYSELF TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAD HAPPENED THAT DAY IN WAYS A FIVE YEAR OLD COULD UNDERSTAND
StevenAddis_2012@94.13:99.14 SO THESE PHOTOS ARE FAR MORE THAN PROXIES FOR A SINGLE MOMENT OR EVEN A SPECIFIC TRIP
StevenAddis_2012@106.63:108.97 AND REFLECT ON OUR TIMES
StevenAddis_2012@109.26:113.72 AND HOW WE CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND NOT JUST PHYSICALLY BUT IN EVERY WAY
StevenAddis_2012@114.2:118.62 BECAUSE WHILE WE TAKE THE SAME PHOTO OUR PERSPECTIVES CHANGE
StevenAddis_2012@119.46:121.57 AND SHE REACHES NEW MILESTONES
StevenAddis_2012@122.35:127.85 AND I GET TO SEE LIFE THROUGH HER EYES AND HOW SHE INTERACTS WITH AND SEES EVERYTHING
StevenAddis_2012@129.26:135.57 THIS VERY FOCUSED TIME WE GET TO SPEND TOGETHER IS SOMETHING WE CHERISH AND ANTICIPATE THE ENTIRE YEAR
StevenAddis_2012@137.66:140.44 RECENTLY ON ONE TRIP WE WERE WALKING
StevenAddis_2012@140.74:148.38 AND SHE STOPS DEAD IN HER TRACKS AND SHE POINTS TO A RED AWNING OF THE DOLL STORE THAT SHE LOVED WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE
StevenAddis_2012@149.02:150.77 ON OUR EARLIER TRIPS
StevenAddis_2012@151.05:153.71 AND SHE DESCRIBES TO ME THE FEELING SHE FELT
StevenAddis_2012@153.83:156.96 AS A FIVE YEAR OLD STANDING IN THAT EXACT SPOT
StevenAddis_2012@157.05:164.72 SHE SAID SHE REMEMBERS HER HEART BURSTING OUT OF HER CHEST WHEN SHE SAW THAT PLACE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME NINE YEARS EARLIER
StevenAddis_2012@165.6:168.97 AND NOW WHAT SHE 'S LOOKING AT IN NEW YORK ARE COLLEGES
StevenAddis_2012@169.63:172.38 BECAUSE SHE 'S DETERMINED TO GO TO SCHOOL IN NEW YORK
StevenAddis_2012@187.44:193.34 I DON 'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT ASIDE FROM THESE FIFTEEN SHOTS I 'M NOT IN MANY OF THE FAMILY PHOTOS I 'M ALWAYS THE ONE TAKING THE PICTURE
StevenAddis_2012@193.7:196.03 SO I WANT TO ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TODAY
StevenAddis_2012@196.25:197.94 TO GET IN THE SHOT
StevenAddis_2012@198.29:202.66 AND DON 'T HESITATE TO GO UP TO SOMEONE AND ASK WILL YOU TAKE OUR PICTURE
