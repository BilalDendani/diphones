LeeSmolin_2003 SO ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO I WAS IN LONDON
LeeSmolin_2003 AND SOMEBODY CALLED HOWARD BURTON CAME TO ME AND SAID I REPRESENT A GROUP OF PEOPLE
LeeSmolin_2003 AND WE WANT TO START AN INSTITUTE IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS WE HAVE ABOUT DOLLAR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION AND WE WANT TO DO IT WELL WE WANT TO BE IN THE FOREFRONT FIELDS AND WE WANT TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY WE WANT TO GET OUT OF THIS THING
LeeSmolin_2003 WHERE THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE ALL THE IDEAS AND THE OLD PEOPLE HAVE ALL THE POWER AND DECIDE WHAT SCIENCE GETS DONE IT TOOK ME ABOUT TWENTY FIVE SECONDS TO DECIDE THAT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA THREE YEARS LATER
LeeSmolin_2003 HERE
LeeSmolin_2003 SO WE THINK A LOT ABOUT WHAT REALLY MAKES SCIENCE WORK THE FIRST THING THAT ANYBODY WHO KNOWS SCIENCE AND HAS BEEN AROUND SCIENCE IS THAT THE STUFF YOU LEARN IN SCHOOL AS A SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS WRONG THERE IS NO
LeeSmolin_2003 SOMEHOW WE MANAGE TO REASON TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY FROM INCOMPLETE EVIDENCE TO CONCLUSIONS THAT WE ALL AGREE ABOUT
LeeSmolin_2003 AND THIS IS BY THE WAY IS SOMETHING THAT A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY ALSO HAS TO DO SO HOW DOES IT WORK WELL MY BELIEF
LeeSmolin_2003 IS THAT IT WORKS BECAUSE SCIENTISTS ARE A COMMUNITY BOUND TOGETHER BY AN ETHIC AND HERE ARE SOME OF THE ETHICAL
LeeSmolin_2003 ONE OF THE PRINCIPLES IS THAT EVERYBODY
LeeSmolin_2003 WHO IS PART OF THE COMMUNITY GETS TO
LeeSmolin_2003 AND ARGUE AS HARD AS THEY CAN FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE BUT WE A RE ALL DISCIPLINED BY THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO DECIDE YOU KNOW WHETHER I A M RIGHT OR SOMEBODY ELSE IS RIGHT ARE THE PEOPLE IN OUR
LeeSmolin_2003 FOR THE TRADITION AND COMMUNITY WE A RE IN AND REBELLION THAT THE COMMUNITY
LeeSmolin_2003 TO GET ANYWHERE THAT MAKES SCIENCE WORK AND BEING IN THIS PROCESS OF BEING IN A COMMUNITY THAT REASONS FROM SHARED EVIDENCE TO CONCLUSIONS
LeeSmolin_2003 I BELIEVE TEACHES US ABOUT DEMOCRACY NOT ONLY IS THERE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ETHICS OF SCIENCE AND THE ETHICS OF BEING A CITIZEN IN DEMOCRACY
LeeSmolin_2003 SOCIETY THAT THEY LIVE IN AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THREE STAGES IN THAT EVOLUTION THE FIRST SCIENCE
LeeSmolin_2003 IS IN THE CENTER THEN THERE ARE THESE CRYSTAL SPHERES THE SUN THE MOON THE PLANETS AND FINALLY THE CELESTIAL SPHERE WHERE THE STARS ARE AND EVERYTHING IN THIS UNIVERSE HAS A PLACE
LeeSmolin_2003 LAW OF MOTION WAS THAT EVERYTHING GOES TO ITS NATURAL PLACE WHICH WAS OF COURSE THE RULE OF THE SOCIETY THAT ARISTOTLE
LeeSmolin_2003 LIVED IN AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE MEDIEVAL SOCIETY THAT THROUGH CHRISTIANITY EMBRACED ARISTOTLE AND BLESSED IT
LeeSmolin_2003 AND THE IDEA IS THAT EVERYTHING IS DEFINED WHERE SOMETHING IS IS DEFINED WITH RESPECT TO THIS
LeeSmolin_2003 LAST SPHERE THE CELESTIAL SPHERE OUTSIDE OF WHICH IS THIS ETERNAL PERFECT REALM WHERE LIVES GOD WHO IS THE ULTIMATE JUDGE OF EVERYTHING
LeeSmolin_2003 THAT IS BOTH ARISTOTELIAN COSMOLOGY AND IN A CERTAIN SENSE MEDIEVAL SOCIETY NOW IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THERE WAS A REVOLUTION IN THINKING ABOUT
LeeSmolin_2003 SPACE AND TIME AND MOTION AND SO FORTH OF NEWTON AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS A REVOLUTION IN SOCIAL THOUGHT
LeeSmolin_2003 JOHN LOCKE AND HIS COLLABORATORS AND THEY WERE VERY CLOSELY ASSOCIATED IN FACT NEWTON AND LOCKE WERE FRIENDS THEIR WAY OF THINKING ABOUT
LeeSmolin_2003 SPACE AND TIME AND MOTION ON THE ONE HAND AND A SOCIETY ON THE OTHER HAND WERE CLOSELY RELATED AND LET ME SHOW YOU IN A NEWTONIAN UNIVERSE THERE A S NO CENTER
LeeSmolin_2003 THANK YOU THERE ARE PARTICLES AND THEY MOVE AROUND WITH RESPECT TO A FIXED ABSOLUTE FRAMEWORK
LeeSmolin_2003 OF SPACE AND TIME IT A S MEANINGFUL TO SAY ABSOLUTELY WHERE SOMETHING IS IN SPACE BECAUSE THAT A S DEFINING NOT WITH RESPECT TO SAY
LeeSmolin_2003 WHERE OTHER THINGS ARE BUT WITH RESPECT TO THIS ABSOLUTE NOTION OF SPACE WHICH FOR NEWTON WAS GOD NOW SIMILARLY IN LOCKE A S SOCIETY THERE ARE
LeeSmolin_2003 WHICH ARE INDEPENDENT OF WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING IN THE SOCIETY OF WHO ELSE THERE IS OF THE HISTORY AND SO FORTH
LeeSmolin_2003 NO ROLE IN ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS BUT IS IN A CERTAIN SENSE EVERYWHERE BECAUSE SPACE IS JUST THE WAY THAT GOD KNOWS WHERE EVERYTHING IS ACCORDING TO
LeeSmolin_2003 SO THIS IS THE FOUNDATIONS OF WHAT A S CALLED TRADITIONALLY LIBERAL POLITICAL THEORY AND NEWTONIAN PHYSICS NOW
LeeSmolin_2003 IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WE HAD A REVOLUTION THAT WAS INITIATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND WHICH IS STILL GOING ON
LeeSmolin_2003 IT WAS BEGUN WITH THE INVENTION OF RELATIVITY THEORY AND QUANTUM THEORY AND MERGING THEM TOGETHER TO MAKE THE FINAL QUANTUM THEORY OF SPACE AND TIME AND GRAVITY
LeeSmolin_2003 IS THE CULMINATION OF THAT SOMETHING THAT A S GOING ON RIGHT NOW AND IN THIS UNIVERSE THERE A S NOTHING FIXED AND ABSOLUTE ZILCH OK THIS UNIVERSE IS DESCRIBED BY BEING A NETWORK OF RELATIONSHIPS
LeeSmolin_2003 AND ALSO IF YOU A RE EMBEDDED IN SUCH A NETWORK OF RELATIONSHIPS YOUR VIEW OF THE WORLD HAS TO DO WITH WHAT INFORMATION COMES TO YOU THROUGH THE NETWORK
LeeSmolin_2003 THIS IS QUANTUM THEORY THIS IS ALSO IF YOU TALK TO LEGAL SCHOLARS THE FOUNDATIONS OF NEW IDEAS IN LEGAL THOUGHT THEY A RE THINKING ABOUT THE SAME THINGS AND
LeeSmolin_2003 THEY MAKE THE ANALOGY TO RELATIVITY THEORY AND COSMOLOGY OFTEN SO THERE A S AN INTERESTING DISCUSSION GOING ON THERE THIS LAST VIEW OF COSMOLOGY IS
LeeSmolin_2003 CALLED THE RELATIONAL VIEW SO THE MAIN SLOGAN HERE IS THAT THERE A S NOTHING OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSE WHICH MEANS THAT THERE A S NO PLACE
LeeSmolin_2003 TO PUT AN EXPLANATION FOR SOMETHING OUTSIDE SO IN SUCH A RELATIONAL UNIVERSE IF YOU COME UPON SOMETHING THAT A S ORDERED AND STRUCTURED LIKE THIS DEVICE HERE OR THAT DEVICE THERE
LeeSmolin_2003 BEAUTIFUL LIKE ALL THE LIVING THINGS ALL OF YOU GUYS IN THE ROOM GUYS IN PHYSICS BY THE WAY IS A GENERIC
LeeSmolin_2003 AND
LeeSmolin_2003 THEN YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU A RE A PERSON YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW IS IT MADE AND IN A RELATIONAL UNIVERSE THE ONLY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION WAS
LeeSmolin_2003 SOMEHOW IT MADE ITSELF THERE MUST BE MECHANISMS OF SELF ORGANIZATION INSIDE THE UNIVERSE THAT MAKE THINGS BECAUSE THERE A S NO PLACE TO PUT A MAKER
LeeSmolin_2003 OUTSIDE AS THERE WAS IN THE ARISTOTELIAN AND THE NEWTONIAN UNIVERSE SO IN A RELATIONAL UNIVERSE WE MUST HAVE PROCESSES OF SELF ORGANIZATION
LeeSmolin_2003 NOW DARWIN TAUGHT US THAT THERE ARE PROCESSES OF SELF ORGANIZATION THAT SUFFICE TO EXPLAIN ALL OF US AND EVERYTHING WE SEE SO IT WORKS BUT NOT ONLY THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW NATURAL SELECTION WORKS
LeeSmolin_2003 THEN IT TURNS OUT THAT NATURAL SELECTION WOULD ONLY MAKE SENSE IN SUCH A RELATIONAL UNIVERSE THAT IS NATURAL SELECTION
LeeSmolin_2003 WORKS ON PROPERTIES LIKE FITNESS WHICH ARE ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS OF SOME SPECIES TO SOME OTHER SPECIES
LeeSmolin_2003 PROPERTIES ARE RELATIONAL NOW NOT ONLY THAT BUT EINSTEIN TAUGHT US THAT GRAVITY
LeeSmolin_2003 IS THE RESULT OF THE WORLD BEING RELATIONAL IF IT WASN A T FOR GRAVITY THERE WOULDN A T BE LIFE BECAUSE GRAVITY
LeeSmolin_2003 CAUSES STARS TO FORM AND LIVE FOR A VERY LONG TIME KEEPING PIECES OF THE WORLD LIKE THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH OUT OF THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS SO LIFE CAN
LeeSmolin_2003 IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WE SAW THE INDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENT OF TWO BIG THEMES IN SCIENCE IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
LeeSmolin_2003 THEY EXPLORED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE NOTION THAT ORDER AND COMPLEXITY AND STRUCTURE ARISE IN A SELF ORGANIZED WAY
LeeSmolin_2003 THAT WAS THE TRIUMPH OF NEO DARWINISM AND SO FORTH AND SLOWLY THAT IDEA IS LEAKING OUT TO THE COGNITIVE SCIENCES THE HUMAN SCIENCES ECONOMICS ET CETERA
LeeSmolin_2003 AT THE SAME TIME WE PHYSICISTS HAVE BEEN BUSY TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF AND BUILD ON AND INTEGRATE THE DISCOVERIES OF QUANTUM THEORY AND RELATIVITY AND WHAT WE A VE BEEN WORKING OUT IS THE IMPLICATIONS REALLY
LeeSmolin_2003 OUR THINKING ABOUT SPACE AND TIME AND COSMOLOGY AND OUR THINKING ABOUT SOCIETY ARE BOTH GOING TO CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND WHAT THEY A RE EVOLVING TOWARDS
LeeSmolin_2003 IS THE UNION OF THESE TWO BIG IDEAS DARWINISM AND RELATIONALISM
LeeSmolin_2003 IF YOU THINK ABOUT DEMOCRACY FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE
LeeSmolin_2003 A NEW PLURALISTIC NOTION OF DEMOCRACY WOULD BE ONE THAT RECOGNIZES THAT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT INTERESTS MANY DIFFERENT AGENDAS MANY DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS MANY DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW EACH ONE IS INCOMPLETE
LeeSmolin_2003 BECAUSE YOU A RE EMBEDDED IN A NETWORK OR RELATIONSHIPS ANY ACTOR IN A DEMOCRACY IS EMBEDDED IN A NETWORK OF RELATIONSHIPS AND YOU UNDERSTAND SOME THINGS BETTER THAN OTHER THINGS
LeeSmolin_2003 THE WAY IN WHICH WE CONTINUALLY ADDRESS OUR NETWORK OF RELATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A BETTER LIFE AND A BETTER SOCIETY AND I ALSO THINK THAT SCIENCE WILL NEVER GO AWAY
LeeSmolin_2003 IN FACT I A M FINISHED SCIENCE WILL NEVER GO AWAY
