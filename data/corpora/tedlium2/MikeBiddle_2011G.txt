MikeBiddle_2011G I HOPE WITHIN THE NEXT TEN MINUTES
MikeBiddle_2011G TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT A LOT OF THE STUFF IN YOUR LIFE AND I 'D LIKE TO START AT THE VERY BEGINNING THINK BACK WHEN YOU WERE JUST A KID HOW DID LOOK AT THE STUFF IN YOUR LIFE
MikeBiddle_2011G IT 'S MY STUFF IF I SAW IT FIRST
MikeBiddle_2011G THE ENTIRE PILE IS MY STUFF IF I 'M BUILDING SOMETHING
MikeBiddle_2011G THE MORE STUFF THAT 'S MINE THE BETTER AND OF COURSE IT 'S YOUR STUFF
MikeBiddle_2011G IF IT 'S BROKEN
MikeBiddle_2011G WE HANDLE ABOUT ONE MILLION POUNDS OF PEOPLE 'S DISCARDED STUFF NOW A MILLION POUNDS A DAY SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF STUFF
MikeBiddle_2011G BUT IT 'S A TINY DROP OF THE DURABLE GOODS THAT ARE DISPOSED EACH AND EVERY YEAR AROUND THE WORLD WELL LESS THAN ONE PERCENT IN FACT THE UNITED NATIONS ESTIMATES THAT THERE 'S ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE BILLION POUNDS A YEAR OF ELECTRONICS WASTE THAT GETS DISCARDED AROUND THE WORLD EACH AND EVERY YEAR AND THAT 'S ONE OF THE MOST RAPIDLY GROWING PARTS OF OUR WASTE STREAM
MikeBiddle_2011G AND IF YOU THROW IN OTHER DURABLE GOODS LIKE AUTOMOBILES AND SO FORTH THAT NUMBER WELL MORE THAN DOUBLES AND OF COURSE THE MORE DEVELOPED THE COUNTRY THE BIGGER THESE MOUNTAINS
MikeBiddle_2011G NOW WHEN YOU SEE THESE MOUNTAINS MOST PEOPLE THINK OF GARBAGE
MikeBiddle_2011G WE SEE ABOVE GROUND MINES AND THE REASON WE SEE MINES IS BECAUSE THERE 'S A LOT OF VALUABLE RAW MATERIALS THAT WENT INTO MAKING ALL OF THIS STUFF IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IT 'S BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT
MikeBiddle_2011G THAT WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXTRACT THESE RAW MATERIALS FROM THESE EXTREMELY COMPLICATED WASTE STREAMS
MikeBiddle_2011G BECAUSE AS WE 'VE HEARD ALL WEEK AT TED THE WORLD 'S GETTING TO BE A SMALLER PLACE WITH MORE PEOPLE IN IT WHO WANT MORE AND MORE STUFF AND OF COURSE THEY WANT THE TOYS AND THE TOOLS THAT MANY OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED AND WHAT GOES INTO MAKING THOSE TOYS AND TOOLS THAT WE USE EVERY SINGLE DAY
MikeBiddle_2011G IT 'S MOSTLY MANY TYPES OF PLASTICS AND MANY TYPES OF METALS AND THE METALS WE TYPICALLY GET FROM ORE THAT WE MINE IN EVER WIDENING MINES AND EVER DEEPENING MINES AROUND THE WORLD
MikeBiddle_2011G AND THESE PRACTICES HAVE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS THAT WE 'RE ALREADY STARTING TO SEE TODAY
MikeBiddle_2011G THE GOOD NEWS IS WE ARE STARTING TO RECOVER MATERIALS FROM OUR END OF LIFE STUFF AND STARTING TO RECYCLE OUR END OF LIFE STUFF PARTICULARLY IN REGIONS OF THE WORLD LIKE HERE IN EUROPE THAT HAVE RECYCLING POLICIES IN PLACE THAT REQUIRE THAT THIS STUFF BE RECYCLED IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER
MikeBiddle_2011G MOST OF WHAT 'S EXTRACTED FROM OUR END OF LIFE STUFF IF IT MAKES IT TO A RECYCLER ARE THE METALS
MikeBiddle_2011G TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE AND I 'M USING STEEL AS A PROXY HERE FOR METALS BECAUSE IT 'S THE MOST COMMON METAL IF YOUR STUFF MAKES IT TO A RECYCLER
MikeBiddle_2011G PROBABLY OVER NINETY PERCENT OF THE METALS ARE GOING TO BE RECOVERED AND REUSED FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE
MikeBiddle_2011G MOST OF IT 'S INCINERATED OR LANDFILLED NOW MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT 'S BECAUSE PLASTICS ARE A THROW AWAY MATERIAL HAVE VERY LITTLE VALUE BUT ACTUALLY PLASTICS ARE SEVERAL TIMES MORE VALUABLE THAN STEEL AND THERE 'S MORE PLASTICS PRODUCED AND CONSUMED AROUND THE WORLD ON A VOLUME BASIS EVERY YEAR THAN STEEL
MikeBiddle_2011G SO WHY IS SUCH A PLENTIFUL AND VALUABLE MATERIAL NOT RECOVERED AT ANYWHERE NEAR THE RATE OF THE LESS VALUABLE MATERIAL
MikeBiddle_2011G SO THE TRADITIONAL WAYS OF SEPARATING MATERIALS JUST SIMPLY DON 'T WORK FOR PLASTICS
MikeBiddle_2011G ANOTHER CONSEQUENCE OF METALS BEING SO EASY TO RECYCLE BY HUMANS IS THAT A LOT OF OUR STUFF FROM THE DEVELOPED WORLD AND SADLY TO SAY PARTICULARLY FROM THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE DON 'T HAVE ANY RECYCLING POLICIES IN PLACE LIKE HERE IN EUROPE FINDS ITS WAY TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FOR LOW COST RECYCLING
MikeBiddle_2011G PEOPLE FOR AS LITTLE AS A DOLLAR A DAY PICK THROUGH OUR STUFF THEY EXTRACT WHAT THEY CAN WHICH IS MOSTLY THE METALS CIRCUIT BOARDS AND SO FORTH AND THEY LEAVE BEHIND MOSTLY WHAT THEY CAN 'T RECOVER WHICH IS AGAIN MOSTLY THE PLASTICS OR THEY BURN THE PLASTICS TO GET TO THE METALS IN BURN HOUSES LIKE YOU SEE HERE
MikeBiddle_2011G AND THEY EXTRACT THE METALS BY HAND
MikeBiddle_2011G NOW WHILE THIS MAY BE THE LOW ECONOMIC COST SOLUTION
MikeBiddle_2011G THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT THE LOW ENVIRONMENTAL OR HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY SOLUTION
MikeBiddle_2011G I CALL THIS ENVIRONMENTAL ARBITRAGE
MikeBiddle_2011G AND IT 'S NOT FAIR IT 'S NOT SAFE AND IT 'S NOT SUSTAINABLE
MikeBiddle_2011G NOW BECAUSE THE PLASTICS ARE SO PLENTIFUL AND BY THE WAY THOSE OTHER METHODS DON 'T LEAD TO THE RECOVERY OF PLASTICS OBVIOUSLY
MikeBiddle_2011G BUT PEOPLE DO TRY TO RECOVER THE PLASTICS THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE THIS IS A PHOTO I TOOK STANDING ON THE ROOFTOPS OF ONE OF THE LARGEST SLUMS IN THE WORLD IN MUMBAI INDIA
MikeBiddle_2011G NONE OF THESE TECHNIQUES RESULT IN ANY AMOUNT OF RECYCLING IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY AND BY THE WAY PLEASE DON 'T TRY THIS TECHNIQUE AT HOME
MikeBiddle_2011G SO WHAT ARE WE TO DO ABOUT THIS SPACE AGE MATERIAL AT LEAST WHAT WE USED TO CALL A SPACE AGED MATERIAL THESE PLASTICS WELL I CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT IT 'S FAR TOO VALUABLE AND FAR TOO ABUNDANT TO KEEP PUTTING BACK IN THE GROUND OR CERTAINLY SEND UP IN SMOKE
MikeBiddle_2011G SO ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO I LITERALLY STARTED IN MY GARAGE TINKERING AROUND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SEPARATE THESE VERY SIMILAR MATERIALS FROM EACH OTHER AND EVENTUALLY ENLISTED A LOT OF MY FRIENDS IN THE MINING WORLD ACTUALLY AND IN THE PLASTICS WORLD AND WE STARTED GOING AROUND TO MINING LABORATORIES AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE AFTER ALL WE 'RE DOING ABOVE GROUND MINING
MikeBiddle_2011G AND WE EVENTUALLY BROKE THE CODE
MikeBiddle_2011G THIS IS THE LAST FRONTIER OF RECYCLING IT 'S THE LAST MAJOR MATERIAL TO BE RECOVERED IN ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT ON THE EARTH AND WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT AND IN THE PROCESS WE STARTED RECREATING HOW THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY MAKES PLASTICS
MikeBiddle_2011G THE TRADITIONAL WAY TO MAKE PLASTICS IS WITH OIL OR PETROCHEMICALS YOU BREAKDOWN THE MOLECULES YOU RECOMBINE THEM IN VERY SPECIFIC WAYS TO MAKE ALL THE WONDERFUL PLASTICS THAT WE ENJOY EACH AND EVERY DAY WE SAID THERE 'S GOT TO BE A MORE SUSTAINABLE WAY TO MAKE PLASTICS AND NOT JUST SUSTAINABLE FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL STANDPOINT
MikeBiddle_2011G SUSTAINABLE FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT AS WELL
MikeBiddle_2011G WELL A GOOD PLACE TO START IS WITH WASTE IT CERTAINLY DOESN 'T COST AS MUCH AS OIL AND IT 'S PLENTIFUL AS I HOPE THAT YOU 'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE FROM THE PHOTOGRAPHS
MikeBiddle_2011G AND BECAUSE WE 'RE NOT BREAKING DOWN THE PLASTIC INTO MOLECULES AND RECOMBINING THEM WE 'RE USING A MINING APPROACH TO EXTRACT THE MATERIALS WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CAPITAL COSTS IN OUR PLANT EQUIPMENT WE HAVE ENORMOUS ENERGY SAVINGS I DON 'T KNOW HOW MANY OTHER PROJECTS ON THE PLANET RIGHT NOW CAN SAVE EIGHTY TO NINETY PERCENT
MikeBiddle_2011G OF THE ENERGY COMPARED TO MAKING SOMETHING THE TRADITIONAL WAY AND INSTEAD OF PLOPPING DOWN SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD A CHEMICAL PLANT THAT WILL ONLY MAKE ONE TYPE OF PLASTIC FOR ITS ENTIRE LIFE
MikeBiddle_2011G OUR PLANTS CAN MAKE ANY TYPE OF PLASTIC WE FEED THEM AND WE MAKE A DROP IN REPLACEMENT FOR THAT PLASTIC THAT 'S MADE FROM PETROCHEMICALS
MikeBiddle_2011G OUR CUSTOMERS GET TO ENJOY HUGE CO TWO SAVINGS THEY GET TO CLOSE THE LOOP WITH THEIR PRODUCTS AND THEY GET TO MAKE MORE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS IN THE SHORT TIME PERIOD I HAVE I WANT TO SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A SENSE ABOUT HOW WE DO THIS
MikeBiddle_2011G IT STARTS WITH METAL RECYCLERS WHO SHRED OUR STUFF INTO VERY SMALL BITS THEY RECOVER THE METALS AND LEAVE BEHIND WHAT 'S CALLED SHREDDER RESIDUE IT 'S THEIR WASTE A VERY COMPLEX MIXTURE OF MATERIALS BUT PREDOMINANTLY PLASTICS
MikeBiddle_2011G WE TAKE OUT THE THINGS THAT AREN 'T PLASTICS SUCH AS THE METALS THEY MISSED CARPETING FOAM RUBBER WOOD GLASS PAPER YOU NAME IT EVEN AN OCCASIONAL DEAD ANIMAL UNFORTUNATELY
MikeBiddle_2011G AND IT GOES IN THE FIRST PART OF OUR PROCESS HERE WHICH IS MORE LIKE TRADITIONAL RECYCLING WE 'RE SIEVING THE MATERIAL WE 'RE USING MAGNETS WE 'RE USING AIR CLASSIFICATION IT LOOKS LIKE THE WILLY WONKA FACTORY AT THIS POINT
MikeBiddle_2011G AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS WE HAVE A MIXED PLASTIC COMPOSITE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLASTICS AND MANY DIFFERENT GRADES OF PLASTICS
MikeBiddle_2011G THIS GOES INTO THE MORE SOPHISTICATED PART OF OUR PROCESS AND THE REALLY HARD WORK
MikeBiddle_2011G MULTI STEP SEPARATION PROCESS BEGINS WE GRIND THE PLASTIC DOWN TO ABOUT THE SIZE OF YOUR SMALL FINGERNAIL WE USE A VERY HIGHLY AUTOMATED PROCESS TO SORT THOSE PLASTICS NOT ONLY BY TYPE BUT BY GRADE AND OUT THE END OF THAT PART OF THE PROCESS COME LITTLE FLAKES OF PLASTIC ONE TYPE ONE GRADE
MikeBiddle_2011G WE THEN USE OPTICAL SORTING TO COLOR SORT THIS MATERIAL WE BLEND IT IN FIFTY THOUSAND LB BLENDING SILOS WE PUSH THAT MATERIAL TO EXTRUDERS WHERE WE MELT IT PUSH IT THROUGH SMALL DIE HOLES MAKE SPAGHETTI LIKE PLASTIC STRANDS AND WE CHOP THOSE STRANDS INTO WHAT ARE CALLED PELLETS AND THIS BECOMES
MikeBiddle_2011G THE CURRENCY OF THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY
MikeBiddle_2011G THIS IS THE SAME MATERIAL
MikeBiddle_2011G AND IT 'S GOING RIGHT BACK INTO YOUR NEW STUFF
MikeBiddle_2011G NOW INSTEAD OF YOUR STUFF ENDING UP ON A HILLSIDE IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY OR LITERALLY GOING UP IN SMOKE
MikeBiddle_2011G YOU CAN FIND YOUR OLD STUFF BACK ON TOP OF YOUR DESK IN NEW PRODUCTS
MikeBiddle_2011G TO ANOTHER FORM FOR ANOTHER USE LATER IN TIME AND FINALLY I HOPE YOU AGREE WITH ME TO CHANGE THAT LAST TODDLER RULE JUST A LITTLE BIT TO IF IT 'S BROKEN
