SheenaIyengar_2010G I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTEEN MINUTES
SheenaIyengar_2010G OF OPERATIONS IS IN THE U S
SheenaIyengar_2010G I KNEW EVEN THEN THAT I WOULD ENCOUNTER CULTURAL DIFFERENCES AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS BUT THEY POPPED UP WHEN I LEAST
SheenaIyengar_2010G MY FIRST DAY I WENT TO A RESTAURANT AND I ORDERED A CUP OF GREEN TEA WITH SUGAR
SheenaIyengar_2010G A PAUSE THE WAITER SAID
SheenaIyengar_2010G ONE DOES NOT PUT SUGAR IN GREEN TEA
SheenaIyengar_2010G PUT SUGAR IN GREEN TEA
SheenaIyengar_2010G I UNDERSTAND I SAID THAT THE JAPANESE DO NOT PUT SUGAR IN THEIR GREEN TEA BUT I'D LIKE TO
SheenaIyengar_2010G I AM VERY SORRY WE DO NOT HAVE SUGAR WELL SINCE I COULDN'T HAVE
SheenaIyengar_2010G THE WAY I WANTED IT I ORDERED A CUP OF COFFEE WHICH THE WAITER BROUGHT OVER PROMPTLY
SheenaIyengar_2010G PACKETS OF
SheenaIyengar_2010G FAILURE TO PROCURE MYSELF A CUP OF SWEET GREEN TEA WAS NOT DUE TO A SIMPLE MISUNDERSTANDING
SheenaIyengar_2010G THIS WAS DUE TO A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN OUR IDEAS ABOUT CHOICE
SheenaIyengar_2010G THE AMERICAN WAY TO QUOTE BURGER KING IS TO HAVE IT YOUR WAY BECAUSE AS STARBUCKS SAYS HAPPINESS IS IN YOUR CHOICES
SheenaIyengar_2010G BUT FROM THE JAPANESE PERSPECTIVE IT'S THEIR DUTY TO PROTECT THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER
SheenaIyengar_2010G IN THIS CASE THE IGNORANT GAIJIN FROM MAKING
SheenaIyengar_2010G LET 'S FACE IT THE WAY I WANTED MY TEA WAS INAPPROPRIATE ACCORDING TO CULTURAL STANDARDS AND THEY WERE DOING THEIR BEST TO HELP ME SAVE
SheenaIyengar_2010G THEY THINK THAT CHOICE AS SEEN THROUGH THE AMERICAN LENS
SheenaIyengar_2010G THEY DON'T EVEN HOLD TRUE AT AMERICA 'S OWN BORDERS
SheenaIyengar_2010G SOME OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM
SheenaIyengar_2010G HOW THEY WERE SHAPED BY YOUR
SheenaIyengar_2010G IF A CHOICE AFFECTS YOU THEN YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE TO MAKE IT
SheenaIyengar_2010G THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THAT YOUR PREFERENCES AND INTERESTS WILL BE MOST FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS
SheenaIyengar_2010G THEIR GUNS REGARDLESS OF WHAT OTHER PEOPLE WANT OR RECOMMEND
SheenaIyengar_2010G IT'S CALLED BEING TRUE TO YOURSELF
SheenaIyengar_2010G BUT DO ALL INDIVIDUALS BENEFIT FROM TAKING SUCH AN APPROACH TO CHOICE
SheenaIyengar_2010G AND I DID A SERIES OF STUDIES IN WHICH WE SOUGHT THE ANSWER TO THIS VERY QUESTION
SheenaIyengar_2010G GROUP CAME IN AND THEY WERE GREETED BY MISS SMITH WHO SHOWED THEM SIX BIG PILES OF ANAGRAM
SheenaIyengar_2010G THE KIDS GOT TO CHOOSE WHICH PILE OF ANAGRAMS THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO AND THEY EVEN GOT TO CHOOSE WHICH MARKER THEY WOULD WRITE THEIR ANSWERS WITH
SheenaIyengar_2010G GROUP OF CHILDREN CAME IN THEY WERE BROUGHT TO THE SAME ROOM SHOWN THE SAME
SheenaIyengar_2010G THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEIR ANAGRAMS AND THEIR AND MARKERS HAD BEEN CHOSEN BY THEIR MOTHERS
SheenaIyengar_2010G WITH THIS PROCEDURE WE WERE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THE KIDS ACROSS THE THREE GROUPS ALL DID THE SAME ACTIVITY MAKING IT EASIER FOR US TO COMPARE PERFORMANCE
SheenaIyengar_2010G SUCH SMALL DIFFERENCES IN THE WAY WE ADMINISTERED THE ACTIVITY YIELDED STRIKING DIFFERENCES IN HOW WELL THEY
SheenaIyengar_2010G AS COMPARED TO WHEN IT WAS CHOSEN FOR THEM BY MISS SMITH OR THEIR MOTHERS
SheenaIyengar_2010G IT DIDN'T MATTER WHO DID THE CHOOSING IF THE TASK WAS DICTATED BY ANOTHER THEIR PERFORMANCE
SheenaIyengar_2010G WHEN THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEIR
SheenaIyengar_2010G BEEN CONSULTED
SheenaIyengar_2010G NAMED MARY SAID YOU ASKED MY MOTHER
SheenaIyengar_2010G ASIAN AMERICAN CHILDREN PERFORMED BEST WHEN THEY BELIEVED THEIR MOTHERS HAD MADE THE CHOICE SECOND BEST WHEN THEY CHOSE FOR THEMSELVES
SheenaIyengar_2010G NAMED NATSUMI EVEN APPROACHED MISS SMITH AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM AND
SheenaIyengar_2010G DID IT JUST LIKE SHE SAID
SheenaIyengar_2010G IF THEY HAD A CONCEPT OF BEING TRUE TO ONE 'S
SheenaIyengar_2010G OR YOU COULD SAY THAT THE
SheenaIyengar_2010G WERE SHAPED BY THE PREFERENCES OF SPECIFIC OTHERS
SheenaIyengar_2010G CLEARLY DIVIDED FROM OTHERS
SheenaIyengar_2010G WHEN IN CONTRAST TWO OR MORE INDIVIDUALS SEE THEIR CHOICES AND THEIR OUTCOMES AS INTIMATELY CONNECTED
SheenaIyengar_2010G THEY MAY AMPLIFY ONE ANOTHER 'S SUCCESS BY TURNING CHOOSING INTO A
SheenaIyengar_2010G THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE AMERICAN PARADIGM
SheenaIyengar_2010G BUT IT IS A MISTAKE TO ASSUME THAT
SheenaIyengar_2010G OF CHOOSING ALONE
SheenaIyengar_2010G SECOND ASSUMPTION WHICH INFORMS THE AMERICAN VIEW OF CHOICE GOES SOMETHING LIKE
SheenaIyengar_2010G WITH TWENTY SEVEN MILLION
SheenaIyengar_2010G MATCH COM WITH WHAT IS IT FIFTEEN MILLION DATE POSSIBILITIES NOW
SheenaIyengar_2010G YOU WILL SURELY FIND THE
SheenaIyengar_2010G COKE DIET COKE SPRITE SEVEN TO BE EXACT
SheenaIyengar_2010G REALLY CAUGHT ME OFF
SheenaIyengar_2010G OH BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S ALL JUST SODA THAT'S JUST ONE CHOICE
SheenaIyengar_2010G HOW MANY CHOICES
SheenaIyengar_2010G WHEN I PUT OUT JUICE AND WATER IN ADDITION TO THESE SEVEN SODAS NOW THEY PERCEIVED IT AS ONLY THREE CHOICES JUICE WATER AND
SheenaIyengar_2010G THE DIE HARD DEVOTION OF MANY AMERICANS NOT JUST TO A PARTICULAR FLAVOR OF SODA BUT TO A PARTICULAR BRAND
SheenaIyengar_2010G YOU AND I KNOW THAT COKE IS THE BETTER CHOICE
SheenaIyengar_2010G AND IMAGES DO YOU ASSOCIATE WITH CHOICE
SheenaIyengar_2010G FROM WARSAW SAID
SheenaIyengar_2010G FOR ME IT IS FEAR
SheenaIyengar_2010G THERE ARE SOME DILEMMAS YOU SEE
SheenaIyengar_2010G I AM USED TO NO CHOICE
SheenaIyengar_2010G BOHDAN FROM KIEV SAID IN RESPONSE TO HOW HE FELT ABOUT THE NEW CONSUMER MARKETPLACE
SheenaIyengar_2010G IT IS TOO MUCH WE DO NOT NEED EVERYTHING THAT IS THERE
SheenaIyengar_2010G A SOCIOLOGIST FROM THE WARSAW SURVEY AGENCY EXPLAINED
SheenaIyengar_2010G ALL AROUND THEM THEY WERE NEVER GIVEN A CHANCE TO LEARN HOW TO REACT
SheenaIyengar_2010G AND TOMASZ A YOUNG POLISH MAN SAID
SheenaIyengar_2010G I DON'T NEED TWENTY KINDS OF CHEWING GUM I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT I WANT NO CHOICE BUT MANY OF THESE CHOICES ARE QUITE ARTIFICIAL
SheenaIyengar_2010G IN REALITY MANY CHOICES ARE BETWEEN THINGS THAT ARE
SheenaIyengar_2010G THE VALUE OF CHOICE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO PERCEIVE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE
SheenaIyengar_2010G SEE HOW ONE CHOICE IS UNLIKE ANOTHER
SheenaIyengar_2010G WHEN THERE ARE TOO MANY CHOICES TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST
SheenaIyengar_2010G CHOICE NO LONGER OFFERS OPPORTUNITIES BUT IMPOSES CONSTRAINTS
SheenaIyengar_2010G CHOICE CAN DEVELOP INTO THE VERY OPPOSITE OF EVERYTHING IT REPRESENTS IN
SheenaIyengar_2010G WHEN IT IS THRUST UPON THOSE WHO ARE INSUFFICIENTLY PREPARED FOR IT
SheenaIyengar_2010G MY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT WHEN YOU GIVE PEOPLE TEN OR MORE OPTIONS WHEN THEY'RE MAKING A CHOICE
SheenaIyengar_2010G BRINGS ME TO THE
SheenaIyengar_2010G OUTSIDE CHICAGO A YOUNG COUPLE SUSAN AND DANIEL MITCHELL WERE ABOUT TO HAVE THEIR FIRST BABY
SheenaIyengar_2010G A NAME FOR
SheenaIyengar_2010G WAS SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT SHE STARTED TO EXPERIENCE CONTRACTIONS AND WAS RUSHED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM
SheenaIyengar_2010G THE BABY WAS DELIVERED THROUGH A
SheenaIyengar_2010G BUT BARBARA SUFFERED CEREBRAL ANOXIA A LOSS OF OXYGEN TO THE BRAIN
SheenaIyengar_2010G THE DOCTORS GAVE THE MITCHELLS A CHOICE
SheenaIyengar_2010G THEY COULD EITHER REMOVE BARBARA OFF THE LIFE SUPPORT IN WHICH CASE SHE WOULD DIE WITHIN A MATTER OF HOURS OR
SheenaIyengar_2010G THEY COULD KEEP HER ON LIFE SUPPORT
SheenaIyengar_2010G IN WHICH CASE SHE MIGHT STILL DIE WITHIN A MATTER OF DAYS IF SHE SURVIVED SHE WOULD REMAIN IN A PERMANENT VEGETATIVE STATE
SheenaIyengar_2010G NEVER ABLE TO WALK
SheenaIyengar_2010G TALK OR INTERACT WITH OTHERS
SheenaIyengar_2010G THEY HAD ALL SUFFERED
SheenaIyengar_2010G THE SAME TRAGEDY
SheenaIyengar_2010G THE DOCTORS DECIDED WHETHER AND WHEN THE LIFE SUPPORT WOULD BE
SheenaIyengar_2010G WHILE IN THE UNITED STATES THE FINAL DECISION RESTED WITH THE
SheenaIyengar_2010G COPE WITH THE LOSS OF THEIR LOVED ONE
SheenaIyengar_2010G WERE MORE LIKELY TO EXPRESS NEGATIVE EMOTIONS AS COMPARED TO THEIR FRENCH
SheenaIyengar_2010G FOR SO LITTLE TIME
SheenaIyengar_2010G HE TAUGHT US SO MUCH HE GAVE US A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE
SheenaIyengar_2010G ANOTHER
SheenaIyengar_2010G AND ANOTHER PARENT SAID
SheenaIyengar_2010G I FEEL AS IF I'VE PLAYED A ROLE IN AN EXECUTION
SheenaIyengar_2010G BUT WHEN THE AMERICAN PARENTS WERE ASKED IF THEY WOULD
SheenaIyengar_2010G THEY ALL SAID NO
SheenaIyengar_2010G THEY COULD NOT IMAGINE
SheenaIyengar_2010G NUMBER OF CASES THEY WERE EVEN CLINICALLY
SheenaIyengar_2010G THESE PARENTS COULD NOT CONTEMPLATE GIVING UP THE CHOICE BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD HAVE GONE CONTRARY TO EVERYTHING THEY HAD BEEN TAUGHT
SheenaIyengar_2010G HER ESSAY THE WHITE ALBUM
SheenaIyengar_2010G JOAN DIDION WRITES
SheenaIyengar_2010G WE INTERPRET WHAT WE SEE
SheenaIyengar_2010G WE LIVE ENTIRELY BY THE IMPOSITION OF A NARRATIVE LINE UPON DISPARATE IMAGES
SheenaIyengar_2010G BY THE IDEAS WITH WHICH WE HAVE LEARNED TO FREEZE
SheenaIyengar_2010G THE SHIFTING PHANTASMAGORIA
SheenaIyengar_2010G WHICH IS OUR ACTUAL EXPERIENCE
SheenaIyengar_2010G THE STORY UPON WHICH THE AMERICAN DREAM DEPENDS IS THE STORY OF LIMITLESS CHOICE
SheenaIyengar_2010G IT'S A GREAT STORY AND IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE WHY THEY WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO REVISE IT
SheenaIyengar_2010G BUT WHEN YOU TAKE A CLOSE LOOK
SheenaIyengar_2010G YOU START TO SEE THE HOLES
SheenaIyengar_2010G AND YOU START TO SEE THAT THE STORY CAN BE TOLD IN MANY OTHER WAYS
SheenaIyengar_2010G AMERICANS HAVE SO OFTEN TRIED TO DISSEMINATE THEIR IDEAS OF CHOICE
SheenaIyengar_2010G THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE THAT WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND AND ORGANIZE THROUGH NARRATIVE
SheenaIyengar_2010G VARIES FROM PLACE TO PLACE
SheenaIyengar_2010G COULD BENEFIT FROM INCORPORATING NEW PERSPECTIVES INTO THEIR OWN NARRATIVE
SheenaIyengar_2010G THAT IT IS POETRY THAT IS LOST IN TRANSLATION
SheenaIyengar_2010G THIS SUGGESTS THAT WHATEVER IS BEAUTIFUL AND MOVING
SheenaIyengar_2010G WHATEVER GIVES US A NEW WAY TO SEE
SheenaIyengar_2010G CANNOT BE COMMUNICATED TO THOSE WHO SPEAK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE
SheenaIyengar_2010G WE HAVE FAR MORE TO GAIN THAN TO LOSE
SheenaIyengar_2010G BY ENGAGING IN THE MANY TRANSLATIONS OF
SheenaIyengar_2010G THE MANY VERSIONS THAT
SheenaIyengar_2010G AND THE MANY THAT HAVE YET TO BE WRITTEN
SheenaIyengar_2010G NO MATTER WHERE WE'RE FROM
SheenaIyengar_2010G AND WHAT YOUR NARRATIVE IS WE ALL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO OPEN OURSELVES UP TO A WIDER ARRAY OF WHAT CHOICE
SheenaIyengar_2010G IT TEACHES US WHEN
SheenaIyengar_2010G THAT MUCH CLOSER TO REALIZING THE FULL POTENTIAL OF CHOICE
SheenaIyengar_2010G IF WE LEARN TO SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER
SheenaIyengar_2010G WE CAN BEGIN TO SEE CHOICE
SheenaIyengar_2010G THANK YOU
SheenaIyengar_2010G DETAIL ABOUT YOUR BIOGRAPHY THAT WE HAVE NOT WRITTEN IN THE PROGRAM BOOK BUT BY NOW IT'S EVIDENT TO EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM YOU'RE BLIND AND
SheenaIyengar_2010G I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS ON EVERYBODY 'S MIND IS HOW DOES THAT INFLUENCE YOUR STUDY OF CHOOSING BECAUSE THAT'S AN ACTIVITY THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE IS ASSOCIATED WITH VISUAL INPUTS LIKE AESTHETICS AND COLOR AND SO ON
SheenaIyengar_2010G FUNNY THAT YOU SHOULD ASK THAT BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT BEING BLIND IS YOU ACTUALLY GET A DIFFERENT VANTAGE POINT WHEN YOU OBSERVE THE WAY SIGHTED PEOPLE MAKE CHOICES AND AS YOU JUST MENTIONED THERE'S LOTS OF CHOICES OUT THERE THAT ARE VERY VISUAL THESE DAYS
SheenaIyengar_2010G YEAH I AS YOU WOULD EXPECT GET PRETTY FRUSTRATED BY CHOICES LIKE WHAT NAIL POLISH TO PUT ON BECAUSE I HAVE TO RELY ON WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SUGGEST AND I CAN'T DECIDE
SheenaIyengar_2010G I ASKED THESE TWO LADIES AND THE ONE LADY TOLD ME WELL YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY WEAR BALLET SLIPPERS WELL WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
SheenaIyengar_2010G IT'S A VERY ELEGANT SHADE OF PINK
SheenaIyengar_2010G OKAY GREAT THE OTHER LADY TELLS ME TO WEAR ADORABLE
SheenaIyengar_2010G WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
SheenaIyengar_2010G AND SO I ASKED THEM WELL HOW DO I TELL THEM APART
SheenaIyengar_2010G THING THEY HAD CONSENSUS ON WELL IF I COULD SEE THEM I WOULD CLEARLY BE ABLE TO TELL THEM APART
SheenaIyengar_2010G WONDERED WAS WHETHER THEY WERE BEING AFFECTED BY THE NAME OR THE CONTENTS OF THE COLOR SO I DECIDED TO DO A LITTLE
SheenaIyengar_2010G THE WOMEN THAT COULD TELL THEM APART WHEN THE LABELS WERE OFF THEY PICKED ADORABLE AND WHEN THE LABELS WERE ON
