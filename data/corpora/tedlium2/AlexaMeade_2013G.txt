AlexaMeade_2013G@41.51:45.45 ON YOUR EAR EVERYTHING IN THIS SCENE THE PERSON
AlexaMeade_2013G@45.45:58.33 THE CLOTHES CHAIRS WALL GETS COVERED IN A MASK OF PAINT THAT MIMICS WHAT 'S DIRECTLY BELOW IT AND IN THIS WAY I 'M ABLE TO TAKE A THREE DIMENSIONAL SCENE AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A TWO DIMENSIONAL
AlexaMeade_2013G@58.33:72.44 PAINTING I CAN PHOTOGRAPH IT FROM ANY ANGLE AND IT WILL STILL LOOK TWO D THERE 'S NO PHOTOSHOP HERE THIS IS JUST A PHOTO OF ONE OF MY THREE DIMENSIONAL PAINTINGS
AlexaMeade_2013G@85.11:87.64 I WAS FASCINATED WITH THE ABSENCE OF
AlexaMeade_2013G@103.31:105.82 UNTIL THE LIGHT CHANGED AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
AlexaMeade_2013G@130.86:138.45 BUT SOMETHING KEPT ON FLICKERING BEFORE MY EYES I WASN 'T QUITE SURE WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT AND THEN WHEN I TOOK THAT MOMENT TO TAKE A STEP BACK
AlexaMeade_2013G@148.4:151.73 I WOULD PULL OUT THIS WHOLE OTHER DIMENSION THAT I WOULD COLLAPSE IT
AlexaMeade_2013G@159.82:178.57 I WAS A LITTLE CONFLICTED THOUGH BECAUSE I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT WHAT I 'D FOUND BUT I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE WITH A DEGREE IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND I 'D ALWAYS HAD THIS DREAM OF GOING TO WASHINGTON D C AND SITTING AT A DESK AND WORKING IN GOVERNMENT
AlexaMeade_2013G@189.77:192.05 AND NOT GOING UP TO CAPITOL
AlexaMeade_2013G@192.14:200.74 BUT GOING DOWN TO MY PARENTS BASEMENT AND MAKING IT MY JOB TO LEARN HOW TO PAINT I HAD NO IDEA WHERE TO BEGIN
AlexaMeade_2013G@201.06:202.75 THE LAST TIME I 'D PAINTED
AlexaMeade_2013G@217.36:235.83 IT WAS ABOUT SPACE AND LIGHT MY EARLY CANVASES ENDED UP BEING THINGS THAT YOU WOULDN 'T EXPECT TO BE USED AS CANVAS LIKE FRIED FOOD IT 'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET PAINT TO STICK TO THE GREASE IN AN EGG
AlexaMeade_2013G@248.02:252.95 AND IF I WANTED TO PAINT ON PEOPLE WELL I WAS A LITTLE BIT
AlexaMeade_2013G@261.67:265.8 IT JUST SEEMED LIKE IT MADE MORE SENSE TO PRACTICE BY PAINTING ON MYSELF
AlexaMeade_2013G@289.32:306.52 I WAS TEACHING MYSELF HOW TO PAINT IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT STYLES AND I WANTED TO SEE WHAT ELSE I COULD DO WITH IT I CAME TOGETHER WITH A COLLABORATOR SHEILA VAND AND WE HAD THE IDEA OF CREATING PAINTINGS IN A MORE UNUSUAL SURFACE AND THAT WAS MILK
AlexaMeade_2013G@307.81:313.14 WE GOT A POOL WE FILLED IT WITH MILK WE FILLED IT WITH SHEILA AND I BEGAN PAINTING
AlexaMeade_2013G@313.14:317.34 AND THE IMAGES WERE ALWAYS COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED IN THE END
AlexaMeade_2013G@317.34:327.97 BECAUSE I COULD HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC IMAGE ABOUT HOW IT WOULD TURN OUT I COULD PAINT IT TO MATCH THAT BUT THE MOMENT THAT SHEILA LAID BACK INTO THE MILK EVERYTHING WOULD CHANGE
AlexaMeade_2013G@327.97:337.96 IT WAS IN CONSTANT FLUX AND WE HAD TO RATHER THAN FIGHT IT EMBRACE IT SEE WHERE THE MILK WOULD TAKE US AND COMPENSATE TO MAKE IT EVEN BETTER
AlexaMeade_2013G@337.96:344.1 SOMETIMES WHEN SHEILA WOULD LAY DOWN IN THE MILK IT WOULD WASH ALL THE PAINT OFF OF HER
AlexaMeade_2013G@356.86:370.1 ALL RIGHT WELL HIDE YOUR FACE AND WE ENDED UP WITH SOMETHING FAR MORE ELEGANT THAN WE COULD HAVE IMAGINED EVEN THOUGH THIS IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME SOLUTION THAT A FRUSTRATED KID USES WHEN HE CAN 'T DRAW HANDS
AlexaMeade_2013G@373.3:383.68 WHEN WE STARTED OUT ON THE MILK PROJECT AND WHEN I STARTED OUT I COULDN 'T HAVE FORESEEN THAT I WOULD GO FROM PURSUING MY DREAM IN POLITICS AND WORKING AT A DESK
AlexaMeade_2013G@383.68:398.36 TO TRIPPING OVER A SHADOW AND THEN TURNING PEOPLE INTO PAINTINGS AND PAINTING ON PEOPLE IN A POOL OF MILK BUT THEN AGAIN I GUESS IT 'S ALSO NOT UNFORESEEABLE THAT YOU CAN FIND THE STRANGE IN THE FAMILIAR
