JamesHansen_2012@16.65:27.65 THAT WOULD CAUSE ME A RETICENT MIDWESTERN SCIENTIST TO GET MYSELF ARRESTED IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE PROTESTING
JamesHansen_2012@27.68:31.07 AND WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU KNEW WHAT I KNOW
JamesHansen_2012@31.2:34.56 LET 'S START WITH HOW I GOT TO THIS POINT
JamesHansen_2012@36.02:40.39 I WAS LUCKY TO GROW UP AT A TIME WHEN IT WAS NOT
JamesHansen_2012@40.39:49.31 DIFFICULT FOR THE CHILD OF A TENANT FARMER TO MAKE HIS WAY TO THE STATE UNIVERSITY AND I WAS REALLY LUCKY TO GO TO THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA
JamesHansen_2012@49.47:52.47 WHERE I COULD STUDY UNDER PROFESSOR JAMES VAN ALLEN
JamesHansen_2012@52.79:56.72 WHO BUILT INSTRUMENTS FOR THE FIRST U S SATELLITES
JamesHansen_2012@57.29:70.04 PROFESSOR VAN ALLEN TOLD ME ABOUT OBSERVATIONS OF VENUS THAT THERE WAS INTENSE MICROWAVE RADIATION DID IT MEAN THAT VENUS HAD AN IONOSPHERE OR WAS VENUS EXTREMELY HOT
JamesHansen_2012@70.44:79.26 THE RIGHT ANSWER CONFIRMED BY THE SOVIET VENERA SPACECRAFT WAS THAT VENUS WAS VERY HOT
JamesHansen_2012@79.64:81.63 NINE HUNDRED DEGREES FAHRENHEIT
JamesHansen_2012@81.68:85.76 AND IT WAS KEPT HOT BY A THICK CARBON DIOXIDE ATMOSPHERE
JamesHansen_2012@86.13:101.15 I WAS FORTUNATE TO JOIN NASA AND SUCCESSFULLY PROPOSE AN EXPERIMENT TO FLY TO VENUS OUR INSTRUMENT TOOK THIS IMAGE OF THE VEIL OF VENUS WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE A SMOG OF SULFURIC ACID
JamesHansen_2012@101.17:104.72 BUT WHILE OUR INSTRUMENT WAS BEING BUILT
JamesHansen_2012@105.38:111.2 I BECAME INVOLVED IN CALCULATIONS OF THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT HERE ON EARTH
JamesHansen_2012@111.72:116.21 BECAUSE WE REALIZED THAT OUR ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION WAS CHANGING
JamesHansen_2012@116.26:120.31 EVENTUALLY I RESIGNED AS PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR
JamesHansen_2012@120.61:134.65 ON OUR VENUS EXPERIMENT BECAUSE A PLANET CHANGING BEFORE OUR EYES IS MORE INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT ITS CHANGES WILL AFFECT ALL OF HUMANITY THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT HAD BEEN WELL UNDERSTOOD FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY
JamesHansen_2012@150.35:153.01 WARMING EARTH 'S SURFACE
JamesHansen_2012@153.01:158.62 I WORKED WITH OTHER SCIENTISTS TO ANALYZE EARTH CLIMATE OBSERVATIONS
JamesHansen_2012@158.62:174.17 IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE WE PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE IN SCIENCE MAGAZINE CONCLUDING THAT OBSERVED WARMING OF ZERO POINT FOUR DEGREES CELSIUS IN THE PRIOR CENTURY WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT OF INCREASING CO TWO
JamesHansen_2012@174.17:182.42 THAT EARTH WOULD LIKELY WARM IN THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY 'S AND WARMING WOULD EXCEED THE NOISE LEVEL OF RANDOM WEATHER BY THE END OF THE CENTURY
JamesHansen_2012@182.5:197.85 WE ALSO SAID THAT THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WOULD SEE SHIFTING CLIMATE ZONES CREATION OF DROUGHT PRONE REGIONS IN NORTH AMERICA AND ASIA EROSION OF ICE SHEETS RISING SEA LEVELS AND OPENING OF THE FABLED NORTHWEST PASSAGE
JamesHansen_2012@238.1:240.27 GLOBAL WARMING HOOPLA
JamesHansen_2012@240.29:257.27 BECAME TIME CONSUMING AND DISTRACTED ME FROM DOING SCIENCE PARTLY BECAUSE I HAD COMPLAINED THAT THE WHITE HOUSE ALTERED MY TESTIMONY SO I DECIDED TO GO BACK TO STRICTLY DOING SCIENCE AND LEAVE THE COMMUNICATION TO OTHERS
JamesHansen_2012@271.33:278.88 TO THE PRESIDENT 'S CLIMATE TASK FORCE BUT ENERGY POLICIES CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON FINDING MORE FOSSIL FUELS
JamesHansen_2012@280.36:282.68 BY THEN WE HAD TWO GRANDCHILDREN
JamesHansen_2012@282.85:286.64 SOPHIE AND CONNOR I DECIDED THAT I DID NOT
JamesHansen_2012@292.71:307.67 SO I DECIDED TO GIVE A PUBLIC TALK CRITICIZING THE LACK OF AN APPROPRIATE ENERGY POLICY I GAVE THE TALK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR AND AT THE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE MEETING OF THE AMERICAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION
JamesHansen_2012@307.67:320.19 THIS LED TO CALLS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TO NASA HEADQUARTERS AND I WAS TOLD THAT I COULD NOT GIVE ANY TALKS OR SPEAK WITH THE MEDIA WITHOUT PRIOR EXPLICIT APPROVAL BY NASA HEADQUARTERS
JamesHansen_2012@320.19:338.6 AFTER I INFORMED THE NEW YORK TIMES ABOUT THESE RESTRICTIONS NASA WAS FORCED TO END THE CENSORSHIP BUT THERE WERE CONSEQUENCES I HAD BEEN USING THE FIRST LINE OF THE NASA MISSION STATEMENT TO UNDERSTAND AND PROTECT THE HOME PLANET TO JUSTIFY MY TALKS
JamesHansen_2012@339.05:351.49 SOON THE FIRST LINE OF THE MISSION STATEMENT WAS DELETED NEVER TO APPEAR AGAIN OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS I WAS DRAWN MORE AND MORE INTO TRYING TO COMMUNICATE THE URGENCY
JamesHansen_2012@375.28:388.96 TO SPACE SO THERE 'S A TEMPORARY ENERGY IMBALANCE MORE ENERGY IS COMING IN THAN GOING OUT UNTIL EARTH WARMS UP ENOUGH TO AGAIN RADIATE TO SPACE AS MUCH ENERGY AS IT ABSORBS FROM THE SUN
JamesHansen_2012@389.05:395.85 SO THE KEY QUANTITY IS EARTH 'S ENERGY IMBALANCE IS THERE MORE ENERGY COMING IN
JamesHansen_2012@404.71:410.27 NOW FINALLY WE CAN MEASURE EARTH 'S ENERGY IMBALANCE PRECISELY
JamesHansen_2012@410.27:425.13 BY MEASURING THE HEAT CONTENT IN EARTH 'S HEAT RESERVOIRS THE BIGGEST RESERVOIR THE OCEAN WAS THE LEAST WELL MEASURED UNTIL MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND ARGO FLOATS WERE DISTRIBUTED AROUND THE WORLD 'S OCEAN
JamesHansen_2012@425.13:431.6 THESE FLOATS REVEAL THAT THE UPPER HALF OF THE OCEAN IS GAINING HEAT AT A SUBSTANTIAL RATE
JamesHansen_2012@431.6:444.61 THE DEEP OCEAN IS ALSO GAINING HEAT AT A SMALLER RATE AND ENERGY IS GOING INTO THE NET MELTING OF ICE ALL AROUND THE PLANET AND THE LAND TO DEPTHS OF TENS OF METERS IS ALSO WARMING
JamesHansen_2012@444.61:453.37 THE TOTAL ENERGY IMBALANCE NOW IS ABOUT SIX TENTHS OF A WATT PER SQUARE METER THAT MAY NOT SOUND LIKE MUCH
JamesHansen_2012@453.48:462.61 BUT WHEN ADDED UP OVER THE WHOLE WORLD IT 'S ENORMOUS IT 'S ABOUT TWENTY TIMES GREATER THAN THE RATE OF ENERGY USE BY ALL OF HUMANITY
JamesHansen_2012@462.89:478.07 IT 'S EQUIVALENT TO EXPLODING FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND HIROSHIMA ATOMIC BOMBS PER DAY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS PER YEAR THAT 'S HOW MUCH EXTRA ENERGY EARTH IS GAINING EACH DAY
JamesHansen_2012@478.07:490.46 THIS IMBALANCE IF WE WANT TO STABILIZE CLIMATE MEANS THAT WE MUST REDUCE CO TWO FROM THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE PPM PARTS PER MILLION BACK TO THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PPM
JamesHansen_2012@490.46:495.77 THAT IS THE CHANGE NEEDED TO RESTORE ENERGY BALANCE AND PREVENT FURTHER WARMING
JamesHansen_2012@495.77:507.73 CLIMATE CHANGE DENIERS ARGUE THAT THE SUN IS THE MAIN CAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE BUT THE MEASURED ENERGY IMBALANCE OCCURRED DURING THE DEEPEST SOLAR MINIMUM
JamesHansen_2012@508.05:512.22 IN THE RECORD WHEN THE SUN 'S ENERGY REACHING EARTH WAS LEAST
JamesHansen_2012@512.22:528.08 YET THERE WAS MORE ENERGY COMING IN THAN GOING OUT THIS SHOWS THAT THE EFFECT OF THE SUN 'S VARIATIONS ON CLIMATE IS OVERWHELMED BY THE INCREASING GREENHOUSE GASSES MAINLY FROM BURNING FOSSIL FUELS NOW CONSIDER EARTH 'S CLIMATE HISTORY
JamesHansen_2012@528.08:545.37 THESE CURVES FOR GLOBAL TEMPERATURE ATMOSPHERIC CO TWO AND SEA LEVEL WERE DERIVED FROM OCEAN CORES AND ANTARCTIC ICE CORES FROM OCEAN SEDIMENTS AND SNOWFLAKES THAT PILED UP YEAR AFTER YEAR OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS FORMING A TWO MILE THICK ICE SHEET
JamesHansen_2012@545.37:554.75 AS YOU SEE THERE 'S A HIGH CORRELATION BETWEEN TEMPERATURE CO TWO AND SEA LEVEL CAREFUL EXAMINATION SHOWS THAT THE TEMPERATURE CHANGES
JamesHansen_2012@554.76:559.28 SLIGHTLY LEAD THE CO TWO CHANGES BY A FEW CENTURIES
JamesHansen_2012@559.28:575.13 CLIMATE CHANGE DENIERS LIKE TO USE THIS FACT TO CONFUSE AND TRICK THE PUBLIC BY SAYING LOOK THE TEMPERATURE CAUSES CO TWO TO CHANGE NOT VICE VERSA BUT THAT LAG IS EXACTLY WHAT IS EXPECTED
JamesHansen_2012@575.39:583.99 SMALL CHANGES IN EARTH 'S ORBIT THAT OCCUR OVER TENS TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS ALTER THE DISTRIBUTION
JamesHansen_2012@584.02:585.79 OF SUNLIGHT ON EARTH
JamesHansen_2012@585.8:597.84 WHEN THERE IS MORE SUNLIGHT AT HIGH LATITUDES IN SUMMER ICE SHEETS MELT SHRINKING ICE SHEETS MAKE THE PLANET DARKER SO IT ABSORBS MORE SUNLIGHT AND BECOMES WARMER
JamesHansen_2012@598.04:606.15 A WARMER OCEAN RELEASES CO TWO JUST AS A WARM COCA COLA DOES AND MORE CO TWO CAUSES MORE WARMING
JamesHansen_2012@622.88:640.75 THE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT THESE SAME AMPLIFYING FEEDBACKS WILL OCCUR TODAY THE PHYSICS DOES NOT CHANGE AS EARTH WARMS NOW BECAUSE OF EXTRA CO TWO WE PUT IN THE ATMOSPHERE ICE WILL MELT AND CO TWO AND METHANE WILL BE RELEASED BY WARMING OCEAN
JamesHansen_2012@640.75:646.58 AND MELTING PERMAFROST WHILE WE CAN 'T SAY EXACTLY HOW FAST THESE
JamesHansen_2012@651.24:653.25 UNLESS WE STOP THE WARMING
JamesHansen_2012@653.67:657.66 THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT FEEDBACKS ARE ALREADY BEGINNING
JamesHansen_2012@657.69:670.69 PRECISE MEASUREMENTS BY GRACE THE GRAVITY SATELLITE REVEAL THAT BOTH GREENLAND AND ANTARCTICA ARE NOW LOSING MASS SEVERAL HUNDRED CUBIC KILOMETERS PER YEAR
JamesHansen_2012@670.73:675.97 AND THE RATE HAS ACCELERATED SINCE THE MEASUREMENTS BEGAN NINE YEARS AGO
JamesHansen_2012@676.75:695.78 METHANE IS ALSO BEGINNING TO ESCAPE FROM THE PERMAFROST WHAT SEA LEVEL RISE CAN WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE LAST TIME CO TWO WAS THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY PPM TODAY 'S VALUE SEA LEVEL WAS HIGHER BY AT LEAST FIFTEEN METERS FIFTY FEET
JamesHansen_2012@696.1:698.84 WHERE YOU ARE SITTING NOW WOULD BE UNDER WATER
JamesHansen_2012@699.76:711.61 MOST ESTIMATES ARE THAT THIS CENTURY WE WILL GET AT LEAST ONE METER I THINK IT WILL BE MORE IF WE KEEP BURNING FOSSIL FUELS PERHAPS EVEN FIVE METERS WHICH IS EIGHTEEN FEET
JamesHansen_2012@711.61:722.54 THIS CENTURY OR SHORTLY THEREAFTER THE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT WE WILL HAVE STARTED A PROCESS THAT IS OUT OF HUMANITY 'S CONTROL
JamesHansen_2012@722.54:736.38 ICE SHEETS WOULD CONTINUE TO DISINTEGRATE FOR CENTURIES THERE WOULD BE NO STABLE SHORELINE THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES ARE ALMOST UNTHINKABLE HUNDREDS OF NEW ORLEANS LIKE DEVASTATIONS AROUND THE WORLD
JamesHansen_2012@736.38:743.23 WHAT MAY BE MORE REPREHENSIBLE IF CLIMATE DENIAL CONTINUES IS EXTERMINATION OF SPECIES
JamesHansen_2012@743.23:748.66 THE MONARCH BUTTERFLY COULD BE ONE OF THE TWENTY TO FIFTY PERCENT OF ALL
JamesHansen_2012@748.7:752.48 SPECIES THAT THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE
JamesHansen_2012@752.5:763.6 ESTIMATES WILL BE TICKETED FOR EXTINCTION BY THE END OF THE CENTURY IF WE STAY ON BUSINESS AS USUAL FOSSIL FUEL USE GLOBAL WARMING IS ALREADY AFFECTING PEOPLE
JamesHansen_2012@763.9:776.2 THE TEXAS OKLAHOMA MEXICO HEATWAVE AND DROUGHT LAST YEAR MOSCOW THE YEAR BEFORE AND EUROPE IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE WERE ALL EXCEPTIONAL EVENTS
JamesHansen_2012@776.2:789.4 MORE THAN THREE STANDARD DEVIATIONS OUTSIDE THE NORM FIFTY YEARS AGO SUCH ANOMALIES COVERED ONLY TWO TO THREE TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT OF THE LAND AREA IN RECENT YEARS
JamesHansen_2012@789.4:805.99 BECAUSE OF GLOBAL WARMING THEY NOW COVER ABOUT TEN PERCENT AN INCREASE BY A FACTOR OF TWENTY FIVE TO FIFTY SO WE CAN SAY WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE THAT THE SEVERE TEXAS AND MOSCOW HEATWAVES WERE NOT NATURAL THEY WERE CAUSED BY GLOBAL WARMING
JamesHansen_2012@806.11:825.25 AN IMPORTANT IMPACT IF GLOBAL WARMING CONTINUES WILL BE ON THE BREADBASKET OF OUR NATION AND THE WORLD THE MIDWEST AND GREAT PLAINS WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BECOME PRONE TO EXTREME DROUGHTS WORSE THAN THE DUST BOWL WITHIN JUST A FEW DECADES IF WE LET GLOBAL WARMING CONTINUE
JamesHansen_2012@825.58:840.58 HOW DID I GET DRAGGED DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO AN ATTEMPT TO COMMUNICATE GIVING TALKS IN TEN COUNTRIES GETTING ARRESTED BURNING UP THE VACATION TIME THAT I HAD ACCUMULATED OVER THIRTY YEARS
JamesHansen_2012@840.75:855.39 MORE GRANDCHILDREN HELPED ME ALONG JAKE IS A SUPER POSITIVE ENTHUSIASTIC BOY HERE AT AGE TWO AND A HALF YEARS HE THINKS HE CAN PROTECT HIS TWO AND A HALF DAY OLD LITTLE SISTER
JamesHansen_2012@855.39:867.93 IT WOULD BE IMMORAL TO LEAVE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH A CLIMATE SYSTEM SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL NOW THE TRAGEDY ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IS THAT WE CAN SOLVE IT
JamesHansen_2012@868.12:886.6 WITH A SIMPLE HONEST APPROACH OF A GRADUALLY RISING CARBON FEE COLLECTED FROM FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES AND DISTRIBUTED ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ELECTRONICALLY EVERY MONTH TO ALL LEGAL RESIDENTS ON A PER CAPITA BASIS WITH THE GOVERNMENT NOT KEEPING ONE DIME
JamesHansen_2012@886.89:893 MOST PEOPLE WOULD GET MORE IN THE MONTHLY DIVIDEND THAN THEY 'D PAY IN INCREASED PRICES
JamesHansen_2012@893:907.53 THIS FEE AND DIVIDEND WOULD STIMULATE THE ECONOMY AND INNOVATIONS CREATING MILLIONS OF JOBS IT IS THE PRINCIPAL REQUIREMENT FOR MOVING US RAPIDLY TO A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE
JamesHansen_2012@907.97:912.41 SEVERAL TOP ECONOMISTS ARE COAUTHORS ON THIS PROPOSITION
JamesHansen_2012@912.41:928.18 JIM DIPESO OF REPUBLICANS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION DESCRIBES IT THUSLY TRANSPARENT MARKET BASED DOES NOT ENLARGE GOVERNMENT LEAVES ENERGY DECISIONS TO INDIVIDUAL CHOICES SOUNDS LIKE A CONSERVATIVE CLIMATE PLAN
JamesHansen_2012@928.18:941.26 BUT INSTEAD OF PLACING A RISING FEE ON CARBON EMISSIONS TO MAKE FOSSIL FUELS PAY THEIR TRUE COST TO SOCIETY OUR GOVERNMENTS ARE FORCING THE PUBLIC
JamesHansen_2012@941.26:960.16 TO SUBSIDIZE FOSSIL FUELS BY FOUR HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR WORLDWIDE THUS ENCOURAGING EXTRACTION OF EVERY FOSSIL FUEL MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL LONGWALL MINING FRACKING TAR SANDS TAR SHALE DEEP OCEAN ARCTIC DRILLING
JamesHansen_2012@960.16:975.52 THIS PATH IF CONTINUED GUARANTEES THAT WE WILL PASS TIPPING POINTS LEADING TO ICE SHEET DISINTEGRATION THAT WILL ACCELERATE OUT OF CONTROL OF FUTURE GENERATIONS A LARGE FRACTION OF SPECIES WILL BE COMMITTED TO EXTINCTION
JamesHansen_2012@975.52:985.09 AND INCREASING INTENSITY OF DROUGHTS AND FLOODS WILL SEVERELY IMPACT BREADBASKETS OF THE WORLD CAUSING MASSIVE FAMINES AND ECONOMIC DECLINE
JamesHansen_2012@985.71:987.71 IMAGINE
JamesHansen_2012@988.2:998 A GIANT ASTEROID ON A DIRECT COLLISION COURSE WITH EARTH THAT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF WHAT WE FACE NOW
JamesHansen_2012@998:1009.48 YET WE DITHER TAKING NO ACTION TO DIVERT THE ASTEROID EVEN THOUGH THE LONGER WE WAIT THE MORE DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE IT BECOMES
JamesHansen_2012@1009.48:1024.74 IF WE HAD STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED EMISSION REDUCTIONS OF THREE PERCENT PER YEAR TO RESTORE PLANETARY ENERGY BALANCE AND STABILIZE CLIMATE THIS CENTURY IF WE START NEXT YEAR IT IS SIX PERCENT PER YEAR
JamesHansen_2012@1024.74:1030.06 IF WE WAIT TEN YEARS IT IS FIFTEEN PERCENT PER YEAR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE
JamesHansen_2012@1030.06:1034.95 PERHAPS IMPOSSIBLE BUT WE AREN 'T EVEN STARTING
JamesHansen_2012@1035.3:1040.29 SO NOW YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW THAT IS MOVING ME TO SOUND THIS ALARM
JamesHansen_2012@1040.84:1046.03 CLEARLY I HAVEN 'T GOTTEN THIS MESSAGE ACROSS THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR
JamesHansen_2012@1046.36:1054.4 I NEED YOUR HELP TO COMMUNICATE THE GRAVITY AND THE URGENCY OF THIS SITUATION AND ITS SOLUTIONS
