TodMachover_2008 THE FIRST IDEA I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST IS THAT WE ALL LOVE MUSIC A GREAT DEAL IT MEANS A LOT TO US
TodMachover_2008 IF YOU DON'T JUST LISTEN TO IT BUT YOU MAKE IT YOURSELF
TodMachover_2008 SO THAT'S MY FIRST IDEA AND WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE MOZART EFFECT THE IDEA THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS THAT JUST BY LISTENING TO MUSIC OR BY PLAYING MUSIC TO YOUR BABY IN VITRO
TodMachover_2008 THAT IT'LL RAISE OUR IQ POINTS TEN TWENTY THIRTY PERCENT GREAT IDEA BUT IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL
TodMachover_2008 POWER TO CREATE AND BE PART OF MUSIC IN A VERY DYNAMIC WAY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN PARTS OF MY WORK SO WITH THE MIT MEDIA LAB FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW
TodMachover_2008 WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN A FIELD CALLED ACTIVE MUSIC WHAT ARE ALL THE POSSIBLE WAYS THAT WE CAN THINK OF TO GET EVERYBODY IN THE MIDDLE OF A MUSICAL EXPERIENCE NOT JUST LISTENING BUT MAKING MUSIC
TodMachover_2008 AND WE STARTED BY MAKING INSTRUMENTS FOR SOME OF THE GREATEST PERFORMERS WE CALL THESE HYPER INSTRUMENTS FOR YO YO MA PETER GABRIEL PRINCE ORCHESTRAS ROCK BANDS INSTRUMENTS WHERE THEY'RE ALL KINDS OF SENSORS BUILT RIGHT INTO THE INSTRUMENT SO THE INSTRUMENT KNOWS HOW IT'S BEING PLAYED
TodMachover_2008 WHEN WE STARTED MAKING THESE I STARTED THINKING WHY CAN'T WE MAKE WONDERFUL INSTRUMENTS LIKE THAT FOR EVERYBODY PEOPLE WHO AREN'T FANTASTIC YO YO MAS OR PRINCES
TodMachover_2008 SO WE'VE MADE A WHOLE SERIES OF INSTRUMENTS ONE OF THE LARGEST COLLECTIONS IS CALLED THE BRAIN OPERA IT'S A WHOLE ORCHESTRA OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED INSTRUMENTS ALL DESIGNED FOR ANYBODY
TodMachover_2008 TO PLAY USING NATURAL SKILL SO YOU CAN PLAY A VIDEO GAME DRIVE THROUGH A PIECE OF MUSIC USE YOUR BODY GESTURE TO CONTROL HUGE MASSES OF SOUND TOUCH A SPECIAL SURFACE TO MAKE MELODIES USE YOUR VOICE TO MAKE A WHOLE AURA
TodMachover_2008 AND THAT LED TO SOMETHING WHICH YOU PROBABLY DO KNOW GUITAR HERO CAME OUT OF OUR LAB AND MY TWO TEENAGE DAUGHTERS AND MOST OF THE STUDENTS AT THE MIT MEDIA LAB ARE PROOF THAT IF YOU MAKE THE RIGHT KIND OF INTERFACE
TodMachover_2008 PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF A PIECE OF MUSIC AND PLAYING IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO
TodMachover_2008 THE MODEL WORKS BUT IT'S ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG BECAUSE MY SECOND IDEA IS THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO WANT TO MAKE MUSIC IN SOMETHING LIKE GUITAR HERO AND MUSIC IS VERY FUN BUT IT'S ALSO TRANSFORMATIVE
TodMachover_2008 IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT MUSIC CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE MORE THAN ALMOST ANYTHING IT CAN CHANGE THE WAY YOU COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS IT CAN CHANGE YOUR BODY IT CAN CHANGE YOU MIND SO WE'RE TRYING TO GO TO THE NEXT STEP OF HOW YOU BUILD ON TOP OF SOMETHING LIKE GUITAR HERO
TodMachover_2008 WE ARE VERY INVOLVED IN EDUCATION WE HAVE A LONG TERM PROJECT CALLED TOY SYMPHONY WHERE WE MAKE ALL KINDS OF INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE ALSO ADDICTIVE BUT FOR LITTLE KIDS SO THE KIDS WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH MAKING MUSIC
TodMachover_2008 WANT TO SPEND THEIR TIME DOING IT AND THEN WILL DEMAND TO KNOW HOW IT WORKS HOW TO MAKE MORE HOW TO CREATE SO WE MAKE SQUEEZY INSTRUMENTS LIKE THESE MUSIC SHAPERS THAT MEASURE THE ELECTRICITY IN YOUR FINGERS
TodMachover_2008 BEAT BUGS THAT LET YOU TAP IN RHYTHMS THEY GATHER YOUR RHYTHM AND LIKE HOT POTATO YOU SEND YOUR RHYTHM TO YOUR FRIENDS WHO THEN HAVE TO IMITATE OR RESPOND TO WHAT YOUR DOING
TodMachover_2008 AND A SOFTWARE PACKAGE CALLED HYPERSCORE WHICH LETS ANYBODY USE LINES AND COLOR TO MAKE QUITE SOPHISTICATED MUSIC EXTREMELY EASY TO USE BUT ONCE YOU USE IT
TodMachover_2008 YOU CAN GO QUITE DEEP MUSIC IN ANY STYLE AND THEN BY PRESSING A BUTTON IT TURNS INTO MUSIC NOTATION SO THAT LIVE MUSICIANS CAN PLAY YOUR PIECES
TodMachover_2008 WE'VE HAD GOOD ENOUGH REALLY VERY POWERFUL EFFECTS WITH KIDS AROUND THE WORLD AND NOW PEOPLE OF ALL AGES USING HYPERSCORE SO WE'VE GOTTEN MORE AND MORE INTERESTED
TodMachover_2008 IN USING THESE KINDS OF CREATIVE ACTIVITIES IN A MUCH BROADER CONTEXT FOR ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T USUALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MUSIC SO ONE OF THE GROWING FIELDS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON AT THE MEDIA LAB RIGHT NOW IS MUSIC MIND AND HEALTH
TodMachover_2008 A LOT OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN OLIVER SACKS WONDERFUL NEW BOOK CALLED MUSICOPHILIA IT'S ON SALE IN THE BOOKSTORE IT'S A GREAT BOOK IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT IT'S WORTH READING HE 'S A PIANIST HIMSELF AND HE DETAILS HIS WHOLE CAREER OF
TodMachover_2008 LOOKING AT AND OBSERVING INCREDIBLY POWERFUL EFFECTS THAT MUSIC HAS HAD ON PEOPLES LIVES IN UNUSUAL SITUATIONS SO WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT MUSIC IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE LAST THING THAT PEOPLE WITH ADVANCED ALZHEIMER 'S CAN STILL RESPOND TO
TodMachover_2008 MAYBE MANY OF YOU HAVE NOTICED THIS WITH LOVED ONES YOU CAN FIND SOMEBODY WHO CAN'T RECOGNIZE THEIR FACE IN THE MIRROR OR CAN'T TELL ANYONE IN THEIR FAMILY BUT YOU CAN STILL FIND A SHARD OF MUSIC THAT THAT PERSON WILL JUMP OUT OF THE CHAIR AND START SINGING
TodMachover_2008 AND WITH THAT YOU CAN BRING BACK PARTS OF PEOPLE 'S MEMORIES AND PERSONALITIES MUSIC IS THE BEST WAY TO RESTORE SPEECH TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST IT THROUGH STROKES MOVEMENT TO PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON 'S DISEASE IT'S VERY POWERFUL FOR DEPRESSION SCHIZOPHRENIA MANY MANY THINGS
TodMachover_2008 SO WE'RE WORKING ON UNDERSTANDING THOSE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES AND THEN BUILDING ACTIVITIES WHICH WILL LET MUSIC REALLY IMPROVE PEOPLE 'S HEALTH AND WE DO THIS IN MANY WAYS WE WORK WITH MANY DIFFERENT HOSPITALS ONE OF THEM IS RIGHT NEAR BOSTON CALLED TEWKSBURY HOSPITAL
TodMachover_2008 LONG TERM STATE HOSPITAL WHERE SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE STARTED WORKING WITH HYPERSCORE AND PATIENTS WITH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DISABILITIES
TodMachover_2008 THIS HAS BECOME A CENTRAL PART OF THE TREATMENT AT TEWKSBURY HOSPITAL SO EVERYBODY THERE CLAMORS TO WORK ON MUSICAL ACTIVITIES IT'S THE ACTIVITY THAT
TodMachover_2008 A REAL EXPERIENCE NOT ONLY TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY AND LISTEN TO RHYTHMS BUT TO TRAIN YOUR MUSICAL MEMORY AND PLAYING MUSIC IN A GROUP
TodMachover_2008 MUSIC TO SHAPE IT THEMSELVES CHANGE IT TO EXPERIMENT WITH IT TO MAKE THEIR OWN MUSIC SO HYPERSCORE LETS YOU START FROM SCRATCH VERY QUICKLY
TodMachover_2008 THE THIRD IDEA I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT MUSIC PARADOXICALLY I THINK EVEN MORE THAN WORDS IS ONE OF THE VERY BEST WAYS WE HAVE OF SHOWING WHO WE REALLY ARE
TodMachover_2008 I LOVE GIVING TALKS ALTHOUGH STRANGELY I FEEL MORE NERVOUS GIVING TALKS THAN PLAYING MUSIC IF I WERE HERE PLAYING CELLO OR PLAYING ON A SYNTH OR SHARING MY MUSIC WITH YOU I'D BE ABLE TO SHOW THINGS ABOUT MYSELF THAT I
TodMachover_2008 TELL YOU IN WORDS MORE PERSONAL THINGS PERHAPS DEEPER THINGS I THINK THAT'S TRUE FOR MAY OF US AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF HOW MUSIC IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL INTERFACES WE HAVE FROM OURSELVES TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD
TodMachover_2008 RICH SUCCESSFUL POWERFUL WHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER SO HE FIGURES OUT A WAY TO DOWNLOAD HIMSELF INTO HIS ENVIRONMENT ACTUALLY INTO A SERIES OF BOOKS
TodMachover_2008 SO THIS GUY WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER HE DOWNLOADS HIMSELF INTO HIS ENVIRONMENT THE MAIN SINGER DISAPPEARS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE OPERA AND THE ENTIRE STAGE BECOMES THE MAIN CHARACTER IT BECOMES HIS LEGACY
TodMachover_2008 AND THE OPERA IS ABOUT WHAT WE CAN SHARE WHAT WE CAN PASS ON TO OTHERS TO THE PEOPLE WE LOVE AND WHAT WE CAN 'T EVERY OBJECT IN THE OPERA COMES ALIVE AND IS A GIGANTIC MUSIC INSTRUMENT LIKE THIS CHANDELIER IT TAKES UP THE WHOLE STAGE IT LOOKS LIKE A CHANDELIER BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A
TodMachover_2008 PIANO STRINGS EACH
TodMachover_2008 LITTLE ROBOTIC ELEMENT EITHER LITTLE BOWS THAT STROKE THE STRINGS PROPELLERS THAT TICKLE THE STRINGS ACOUSTIC SIGNALS THAT VIBRATE THE STRINGS
TodMachover_2008 WE ALSO HAVE AN ARMY OF ROBOTS ON STAGE THESE ROBOTS ARE THE KIND OF THE INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE MAIN CHARACTER SIMON POWERS AND HIS FAMILY
TodMachover_2008 THERE ARE A WHOLE SERIES OF THEM KIND OF LIKE A GREEK CHORUS THEY OBSERVE THE ACTION WE'VE DESIGNED THESE SQUARE ROBOTS THAT WE'RE TESTING RIGHT NOW AT MIT
TodMachover_2008 WHEN YOU SNAP LINE UP EXACTLY THE WAY YOU'D LIKE TO EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE CUBES THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF PERSONALITY
TodMachover_2008 THE LARGEST SET PIECE IN THE OPERA IS CALLED THE SYSTEM IT'S A SERIES OF BOOKS EVERY SINGLE BOOK IS ROBOTIC SO THEY ALL MOVE THEY ALL MAKE SOUND AND WHEN YOU PUT THEM ALL
TodMachover_2008 TURN INTO THESE WALLS WHICH HAVE THE GESTURE AND THE PERSONALITY OF SIMON POWERS SO HE 'S DISAPPEARED BUT THE WHOLE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
TodMachover_2008 BECOMES THIS PERSON THIS IS HOW HE 'S CHOSEN TO REPRESENT
TodMachover_2008 HIGH PACKED
TodMachover_2008 ALL DISPLAY AND HERE 'S THE GREAT
TodMachover_2008 IN MONACO IT'S IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND NINE IF BY ANY CHANCE YOU CAN'T MAKE IT ANOTHER IDEA WITH THIS PROJECT HERE 'S THIS GUY BUILDING HIS LEGACY THROUGH THIS VERY UNUSUAL FORM THROUGH MUSIC AND THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENT
TodMachover_2008 BUT WE'RE ALSO MAKING THIS AVAILABLE BOTH ONLINE AND IN PUBLIC SPACES AS A WAY OF EACH OF US TO USE MUSIC AND IMAGES OF OUR LIVES
TodMachover_2008 BUT WHAT IF I COULD MAKE AN INSTRUMENT THAT COULD BE ADAPTED TO THE WAY I PERSONALLY BEHAVE TO THE WAY MY HANDS WORK TO WHAT I DO VERY SKILLFULLY
TodMachover_2008 SO CAN YOU GIVE A HAND TO ADAM
TodMachover_2008 PH D STUDENT FROM THE MIT MEDIA LAB
TodMachover_2008 AND DAN ELLSEY
TodMachover_2008 THANKS TO TED AND TO
TodMachover_2008 DAN IS HERE WITH US TODAY ALL THE WAY FROM TEWKSBURY HE 'S A RESIDENT AT TEWKSBURY HOSPITAL THIS IS BY FAR THE FARTHEST HE 'S STRAYED FROM TEWKSBURY HOSPITAL I CAN TELL YOU THAT
TodMachover_2008 HELLO MY NAME IS DAN ELLSEY I AM THIRTY FOUR YEARS OLD AND I HAVE CEREBRAL PALSY
TodMachover_2008 AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO HAVE YOU HERE
TodMachover_2008 SO WE MET DAN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO WHEN WE STARTED WORKING AT TEWKSBURY EVERYBODY WE MET THERE WAS
TodMachover_2008 AND OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS BEEN A CONSTANT COLLABORATOR OF OURS HE HAS MADE MANY MANY PIECES HE MAKES HIS OWN CDS ACTUALLY HE IS QUITE WELL KNOWN IN THE BOSTON AREA MENTORS PEOPLE AT THE HOSPITAL AND CHILDREN LOCALLY IN HOW TO MAKE THEIR OWN MUSIC
TodMachover_2008 AND I'LL LET ADAM TELL YOU SO ADAM IS A PH D STUDENT AT MIT AN EXPERT IN MUSIC TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE AND ADAM AND DAN HAVE BECOME CLOSE COLLABORATORS WHAT ADAM 'S BEEN WORKING ON FOR THIS LAST PERIOD
TodMachover_2008 YES SO TOD AND I ENTERED INTO A DISCUSSION FOLLOWING THE TEWKSBURY WORK AND IT WAS REALLY ABOUT HOW DAN IS AN EXPRESSIVE PERSON AND HE 'S AN INTELLIGENT AND CREATIVE PERSON AND
TodMachover_2008 SO WE STARTED DEVELOPING A TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL ALLOW HIM WITH NUANCE WITH PRECISION WITH CONTROL AND DESPITE HIS PHYSICAL DISABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM HIS PIECE OF MUSIC SO
TodMachover_2008 THE PROCESS AND THE TECHNOLOGY BASICALLY FIRST WE NEEDED AN ENGINEERING SOLUTION SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE A FIREWIRE CAMERA IT LOOKED AT AN INFRARED POINTER WE WENT WITH THE TYPE OF GESTURE METAPHOR THAT HE WAS ALREADY USED TO
TodMachover_2008 WITH HIS SPEAKING CONTROLLER AND THIS WAS ACTUALLY THE LEAST INTERESTING PART OF THE WORK YOU KNOW THE DESIGN PROCESS WE NEEDED AN INPUT WE NEEDED CONTINUOUS TRACKING IN THE SOFTWARE WOULD LOOK AT THE TYPES OF SHAPES HE 'S MAKING
TodMachover_2008 BUT THEN WAS THE REALLY INTERESTING ASPECT OF THE WORK FOLLOWING THE ENGINEERING PART WHERE BASICALLY WE'RE CODING OVER DAN 'S SHOULDER AT THE HOSPITAL EXTENSIVELY TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW HOW DOES DAN MOVE WHAT'S USEFUL TO HIM AS AN EXPRESSIVE MOTION
TodMachover_2008 YOU KNOW WHAT'S HIS METAPHOR FOR PERFORMANCE WHAT TYPES OF THINGS DOES HE FIND IMPORTANT TO CONTROL AND CONVEY IN A PIECE OF MUSIC SO ALL THE PARAMETER FITTING AND REALLY
TodMachover_2008 THEY PROVIDE ACCESS THEY ALLOW US TO CREATE PIECES OF CREATIVE WORK BUT WHAT ABOUT EXPRESSION WHAT ABOUT THAT MOMENT WHEN AN ARTIST DELIVERS THAT PIECE OF WORK YOU KNOW DO OUR TECHNOLOGIES ALLOW US TO EXPRESS DO THEY PROVIDE STRUCTURE FOR US TO DO THAT
TodMachover_2008 AND YOU KNOW THATS A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP TO EXPRESSION THAT IS LACKING IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL SPHERES SO YOU KNOW WITH DAN WE NEEDED A NEW DESIGN PROCESS A NEW ENGINEERING PROCESS TO SORT OF DISCOVER HIS MOVEMENT AND HIS PATH TO EXPRESSION THAT ALLOW HIM TO PERFORM
TodMachover_2008 AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO
TodMachover_2008 SO LET 'S DO IT SO DAN DO YOU WANT TO TELL EVERYONE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY NOW
TodMachover_2008 THIS IS MY EAGLE SONG
TodMachover_2008 SO DAN IS GOING TO PLAY A PIECE OF HIS CALLED MY EAGLE SONG IN FACT THIS IS THE SCORE OF DAN 'S PIECE COMPLETELY COMPOSED BY DAN IN HYPERSCORE SO HE CAN USE HIS INFRARED
TodMachover_2008 'S REALLY MODEST TOO SO HE CAN GO IN
TodMachover_2008 DRAWS THE LINES PLACES EVERYTHING THE WAY HE WANTS TO LOOKING AT THE HYPERSCORE YOU CAN SEE IT ALSO YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE SECTIONS ARE SOMETHING MIGHT CONTINUE FOR A WHILE CHANGE GET REALLY CRAZY
TodMachover_2008 AND THEN END UP WITH A BIG BANG AT THE END
TodMachover_2008 SO THAT'S THE WAY HE MADE HIS PIECE AND AS ADAM SAYS
TodMachover_2008 WE THEN FIGURED OUT THE BEST WAY TO HAVE HIM
TodMachover_2008 WHAT THE CAMERA IS MEASURING BUT INSTEAD OF MAKING IT VERY LITERAL SHOWING YOU EXACTLY THE CAMERA TRACING WE TURNED IT INTO A GRAPHIC THAT SHOWS YOU THE BASIC MOVEMENT AND SHOWS THE WAY IT'S BEING ANALYZED
TodMachover_2008 I THINK IT GIVES AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WE'RE PICKING OUT MOVEMENT FROM WHAT DAN 'S DOING BUT I THINK IT WILL ALSO SHOW YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THAT MOVEMENT THAT
TodMachover_2008 WHEN DAN MAKES MUSIC
TodMachover_2008 HIS MOTIONS ARE VERY PURPOSEFUL VERY PRECISE VERY DISCIPLINED AND THEY'RE ALSO VERY BEAUTIFUL SO IN HEARING THIS PIECE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THE MUSIC 'S GREAT
TodMachover_2008 AND IT'LL SHOW YOU WHO DAN IS SO ARE WE READY ADAM AB YEAH TM OK NOW DAN WILL PLAY HIS PIECE MY EAGLE SONG FOR YOU
