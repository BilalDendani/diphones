JoshSilver_2009G@59.89:72.00 THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION ESTIMATES WELL THEY MAKE VARIOUS ESTIMATES OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO NEED GLASSES THE LOWEST ESTIMATE IS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE
JoshSilver_2009G@72.66:80.10 THEY ALSO HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF AROUND A BILLION BUT IN FACT I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE'VE JUST DONE AN EXPERIMENT HERE AND NOW
JoshSilver_2009G@80.52:88.06 WHICH SHOWS US THAT THE GLOBAL NEED FOR CORRECTIVE EYEWEAR IS AROUND HALF OF ANY POPULATION
