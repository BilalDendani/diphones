PeterGabriel_2006@12.79:18.63 I LOVE TREES AND I'M VERY LUCKY BECAUSE WE LIVE NEAR A WONDERFUL ARBORETUM AND
PeterGabriel_2006@20.16:27.76 USUALLY I'D GO THERE WITH MY WIFE AND NOW WITH MY FOUR YEAR OLD AND WE'D CLIMB IN THE TREES WE'D PLAY HIDE AND SEEK THE SECOND SCHOOL I WAS
PeterGabriel_2006@29.45:39.67 HAD BIG TREES TOO HAD A FANTASTIC TULIP TREE I THINK IT WAS THE BIGGEST IN THE COUNTRY AND IT ALSO HAD A LOT OF WONDERFUL BUSHES AND VEGETATION AROUND IT AROUND THE PLAYING
PeterGabriel_2006@41.24:51.51 ONE DAY I WAS GRABBED BY SOME OF MY CLASSMATES AND TAKEN IN THE BUSHES I WAS STRIPPED I WAS ATTACKED I WAS ABUSED AND THIS CAME OUT OF THE BLUE
PeterGabriel_2006@53.35:62.70 NOW THE REASON I SAY THAT BECAUSE AFTERWARDS I WAS THINKING WELL I WENT BACK INTO THE SCHOOL I FELT DIRTY I FELT BETRAYED
PeterGabriel_2006@63.46:64.73 FELT ASHAMED
PeterGabriel_2006@67.38:75.74 MAINLY I FELT POWERLESS AND THIRTY YEARS LATER I WAS SITTING IN AN AIRPLANE NEXT TO A LADY CALLED VERONICA WHO CAME FROM CHILE
PeterGabriel_2006@91.93:95.51 IT WAS AN AMAZING LEARNING EXPERIENCE BECAUSE FOR ME HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN SOMETHING
PeterGabriel_2006@107.69:113.72 AND AS YOU KNOW HE 'S A GREAT SINGER BUT HE 'S A MAGNIFICENT HUSTLER
PeterGabriel_2006@116.35:125.81 VERY HARD GUY TO SAY NO TO AND HE WAS SAYING YOU KNOW JUST AFTER I'D DONE THE BIKO SONG WE'RE GOING TO DO A TOUR FOR AMNESTY YOU HAVE TO BE ON IT AND REALLY THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
PeterGabriel_2006@126.85:137.57 BEEN OUT AND STARTED MEETING PEOPLE WHO 'D WATCHED THEIR FAMILY BEING SHOT IN FRONT OF THEM AND HAD A PARTNER THROWN OUT OF AN AIRPLANE INTO AN OCEAN AND SUDDENLY
PeterGabriel_2006@138.37:146.35 THIS WORLD OF HUMAN RIGHTS ARRIVED IN MY WORLD AND I COULDN 'T REALLY WALK AWAY IN QUITE THE SAME WAY AS BEFORE AND
PeterGabriel_2006@146.91:154.19 SO I GOT INVOLVED WITH THIS TOUR WHICH WAS FOR AMNESTY AND THEN IN EIGHTY EIGHT I TOOK OVER BONO'S JOB
PeterGabriel_2006@154.62:166.46 TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO HUSTLE I DIDN'T DO IT AS WELL BUT WE MANAGED TO GET YOUSSOU N 'DOUR STING TRACY CHAPMAN AND BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN TO GO ROUND THE WORLD FOR AMNESTY AND IT WAS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE
PeterGabriel_2006@167.38:174.94 AND ONCE AGAIN I GOT AN EXTRAORDINARY EDUCATION AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME REALLY THAT I'D MET
PeterGabriel_2006@175.24:182.04 A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND THESE HUMAN RIGHTS STORIES BECAME VERY PHYSICAL
PeterGabriel_2006@182.94:192.23 AND AGAIN I COULDN 'T REALLY WALK AWAY QUITE SO COMFORTABLY BUT THE THING THAT REALLY AMAZED ME THAT I HAD NO IDEA WAS
PeterGabriel_2006@192.46:198.88 YOU COULD SUFFER IN THIS WAY AND THEN HAVE YOUR WHOLE EXPERIENCE YOUR STORY
PeterGabriel_2006@200.78:206.80 BURIED AND FORGOTTEN AND IT SEEMED THAT WHENEVER THERE WAS A CAMERA
PeterGabriel_2006@208.79:213.54 A VIDEO OR FILM CAMERA IT WAS A GREAT DEAL HARDER TO DO
PeterGabriel_2006@216.60:217.84 TO BURY THE STORY
PeterGabriel_2006@218.91:223.36 AND REEBOK SET UP A FOUNDATION AFTER THESE HUMAN RIGHTS NOW TOURS AND
PeterGabriel_2006@236.01:244.55 IT DIDN 'T REALLY GET ANYWHERE AND THEN THE RODNEY KING INCIDENT HAPPENED AND PEOPLE THOUGHT OK IF YOU HAVE A CAMERA IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME OR PERHAPS THE WRONG TIME
PeterGabriel_2006@245.63:253.75 WHO YOU ARE THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY START DOING SOMETHING AND CAMPAIGNING
PeterGabriel_2006@263.57:264.26 SINCE GIVEN
PeterGabriel_2006@266.23:273.36 OUT IN OVER SIXTY COUNTRIES AND WE CAMPAIGN WITH ACTIVIST GROUPS
PeterGabriel_2006@274.52:276.18 AND HELP THEM TELL THEIR STORY
PeterGabriel_2006@286.47:294.70 WE HAD A WONDERFUL STORY FROM UGANDA YESTERDAY THIS ONE ISN'T QUITE SO GOOD AND IN THE NORTH OF UGANDA THERE ARE SOMETHING LIKE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION
PeterGabriel_2006@295.80:303.40 INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT REFUGEES IN ANOTHER COUNTRY BUT BECAUSE OF THE CIVIL WAR WHICH HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS
PeterGabriel_2006@303.98:311.03 THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO LIVE AND TWENTY THOUSAND KIDS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY TO BECOME CHILD SOLDIERS
PeterGabriel_2006@322.17:330.89 IT'S LORD 'S RESISTANCE ARMY I BELIEVE BUT THE GOVERNMENT ALSO DOESN'T HAVE A CLEAN SHEET SO IF WE COULD RUN THE FIRST VIDEO
PeterGabriel_2006@340.12:340.27 THE
PeterGabriel_2006@379.83:380.41 AND I
PeterGabriel_2006@388.01:388.14 THE
PeterGabriel_2006@392.10:392.45 THE
PeterGabriel_2006@401.87:402.14 THE
PeterGabriel_2006@412.73:412.93 ME
PeterGabriel_2006@429.07:429.24 I
PeterGabriel_2006@481.11:484.05 IS NOT SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS ON
PeterGabriel_2006@484.70:486.74 OTHER SOIL IN

PeterGabriel_2006@506.73:511.70 BEEN TAKEN OUT OF HIS HOME IN QUEENS TAKEN TO A PLACE IN THE MIDWEST

PeterGabriel_2006@517.67:519.48 THE STREET FOUR WEEKS LATER
PeterGabriel_2006@520.78:525.50 BECAUSE HE HAD THE SAME HE WAS MIDDLE EASTERN AND HE HAD THE SAME NAME AS ONE OF THE NINE ELEVEN
PeterGabriel_2006@526.58:527.54 PILOTS AND
PeterGabriel_2006@530.64:537.54 THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS A LIAR THOUGH AND I THINK IF WE LOOK AROUND THE WORLD
PeterGabriel_2006@538.35:551.30 AS WELL AS THE POLAR ICE CAPS MELTING HUMAN RIGHTS WHICH HAVE BEEN FOUGHT FOR FOR MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS IN SOME CASES ARE ALSO ERODING VERY FAST AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO
PeterGabriel_2006@552.39:553.43 TAKE A LOOK AT AND
PeterGabriel_2006@555.04:556.32 MAYBE START CAMPAIGNING
PeterGabriel_2006@556.86:570.28 FOR I MEAN HERE TOO ONE OF OUR PARTNERS HAS WAS AT VAN JONES AND THE BOOKS NOT BARS PROJECT THEY HAVE MANAGED WITH THEIR FOOTAGE TO IN CALIFORNIA TO CHANGE THE
PeterGabriel_2006@572.26:574.77 CORRECTION SYSTEMS EMPLOYED AND IT'S MUCH
PeterGabriel_2006@597.78:601.79 NO NOT AT ALL NO PROBLEM TAKE YOUR TIME BUT THIS
PeterGabriel_2006@603.83:608.93 WHOEVER THAT MAN IS WHATEVER HE 'S DONE THIS IS CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT
PeterGabriel_2006@612.35:612.99 HAS BEEN
PeterGabriel_2006@615.51:622.60 THE BRAVE PEOPLE WHO OFTEN PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK AROUND THE WORLD WITH CAMERAS AND I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU JUST A LITTLE MORE
PeterGabriel_2006@739.51:748.79 AND WE 'VE ALSO BEEN TRYING TO GET COMPUTERS OUT TO THE WORLD SO THAT GROUPS CAN COMMUNICATE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY CAMPAIGN MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY BUT NOW
PeterGabriel_2006@749.34:751.74 WE HAVE THE WONDERFUL POSSIBILITY
PeterGabriel_2006@753.17:760.69 WHICH IS GIVEN TO US FROM THE MOBILE PHONE WITH THE CAMERA IN IT BECAUSE THAT IS CHEAP IT'S UBIQUITOUS AND IT'S
PeterGabriel_2006@761.03:767.93 MOVING FAST ALL ROUND THE WORLD AND IT'S VERY EXCITING FOR US AND SO THE DREAM IS THAT
PeterGabriel_2006@768.40:770.78 WE COULD HAVE A WORLD IN WHICH ANYONE
PeterGabriel_2006@773.27:780.87 ANYTHING BAD HAPPEN TO THEM OF THIS SORT HAS A CHANCE OF GETTING THEIR STORY UPLOADED BEING SEEN
PeterGabriel_2006@781.19:788.73 BEING WATCHED THAT THEY REALLY KNOW THAT THEY CAN BE HEARD THAT THERE WOULD BE A GIANT WEBSITE
PeterGabriel_2006@789.66:797.79 MAYBE A LITTLE LIKE GOOGLE EARTH AND YOU COULD FLY OVER AND FIND OUT THE REALITIES OF WHAT'S GOING FOR THE WORLD 'S INHABITANTS IN A WAY
PeterGabriel_2006@798.59:803.22 WHAT THIS TECHNOLOGY IS ALLOWING IS REALLY THAT A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD
PeterGabriel_2006@804.30:815.08 HAVE A HUMAN FACE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHO 'S DYING OF AIDS OR WHO 'S BEING BEATEN UP FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WE CAN HEAR THEIR STORIES
PeterGabriel_2006@815.47:823.37 IN A WAY THAT THE BLOGGER CULTURE IF WE CAN MOVE THAT INTO THESE SORT OF FIELDS I THINK WE CAN REALLY TRANSFORM
PeterGabriel_2006@823.67:825.74 THE WORLD IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS
PeterGabriel_2006@827.97:830.50 COULD BE A NEW MOVEMENT GROWING UP
PeterGabriel_2006@834.68:835.66 REACHING FOR THE LIGHT
