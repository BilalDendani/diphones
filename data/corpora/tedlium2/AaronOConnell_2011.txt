AaronOConnell_2011@35.77:38.54 THIS WOULD BE SOMEONE WHO 'S ENTIRELY INTUITIVE
AaronOConnell_2011@38.54:56.8 SO WHERE WOULD YOU PUT YOUR BRAIN ON THIS SCALE SOME OF US MAY HAVE OPTED FOR ONE OF THESE EXTREMES BUT I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE YOUR BRAIN IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS WITH A HIGH APTITUDE IN BOTH HEMISPHERES AT THE SAME TIME IT 'S NOT LIKE THEY 'RE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE OR ANYTHING YOU CAN BE LOGICAL AND INTUITIVE
AaronOConnell_2011@56.81:71.53 AND SO I CONSIDER MYSELF ONE OF THESE PEOPLE ALONG WITH MOST OF THE OTHER EXPERIMENTAL QUANTUM PHYSICISTS WHO NEED A GOOD DEAL OF LOGIC TO STRING TOGETHER THESE COMPLEX IDEAS BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED A GOOD DEAL OF INTUITION TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE EXPERIMENTS WORK
AaronOConnell_2011@71.89:90.22 HOW DO WE DEVELOP THIS INTUITION WELL WE LIKE TO PLAY WITH STUFF SO WE GO OUT AND PLAY WITH IT AND THEN WE SEE HOW IT ACTS AND THEN WE DEVELOP OUR INTUITION FROM THERE AND REALLY YOU DO THE SAME THING SO SOME INTUITION THAT YOU MAY HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS IS THAT ONE THING IS ONLY IN ONE PLACE AT A TIME
AaronOConnell_2011@90.73:100.21 I MEAN IT CAN SOUND WEIRD TO THINK ABOUT ONE THING BEING IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES AT THE SAME TIME BUT YOU WEREN 'T BORN WITH THIS NOTION YOU DEVELOPED IT
AaronOConnell_2011@100.48:115.37 AND I REMEMBER WATCHING A KID PLAYING ON A CAR STOP HE WAS JUST A TODDLER AND HE WASN 'T VERY GOOD AT IT AND HE KEPT FALLING OVER BUT I BET PLAYING WITH THIS CAR STOP TAUGHT HIM A REALLY VALUABLE LESSON AND THAT 'S THAT LARGE THINGS DON 'T LET YOU GET RIGHT PAST THEM AND THAT THEY STAY IN ONE PLACE
AaronOConnell_2011@116.1:119.65 AND SO THIS IS A GREAT CONCEPTUAL MODEL TO HAVE OF THE WORLD
AaronOConnell_2011@119.65:138.55 UNLESS YOU 'RE A PARTICLE PHYSICIST IT 'D BE A TERRIBLE MODEL FOR A PARTICLE PHYSICIST BECAUSE THEY DON 'T PLAY WITH CAR STOPS THEY PLAY WITH THESE LITTLE WEIRD PARTICLES AND WHEN THEY PLAY WITH THEIR PARTICLES THEY FIND THEY DO ALL SORTS OF REALLY WEIRD THINGS LIKE THEY CAN FLY RIGHT THROUGH WALLS OR THEY CAN BE IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES AT THE SAME TIME
AaronOConnell_2011@139.26:159.03 AND SO THEY WROTE DOWN ALL THESE OBSERVATIONS AND THEY CALLED IT THE THEORY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AND SO THAT 'S WHERE PHYSICS WAS AT A FEW YEARS AGO YOU NEEDED QUANTUM MECHANICS TO DESCRIBE LITTLE TINY PARTICLES BUT YOU DIDN 'T NEED IT TO DESCRIBE THE LARGE EVERYDAY OBJECTS AROUND US
AaronOConnell_2011@159.33:173.58 THIS DIDN 'T REALLY SIT WELL WITH MY INTUITION AND MAYBE IT 'S JUST BECAUSE I DON 'T PLAY WITH PARTICLES VERY OFTEN WELL I PLAY WITH THEM SOMETIMES BUT NOT VERY OFTEN AND I 'VE NEVER SEEN THEM I MEAN NOBODY 'S EVER SEEN A PARTICLE
AaronOConnell_2011@174.39:187.37 BUT IT DIDN 'T SIT WELL WITH MY LOGICAL SIDE EITHER BECAUSE IF EVERYTHING IS MADE UP OF LITTLE PARTICLES AND ALL THE LITTLE PARTICLES FOLLOW QUANTUM MECHANICS THEN SHOULDN 'T EVERYTHING JUST FOLLOW QUANTUM MECHANICS
AaronOConnell_2011@192.23:203.12 AND SO I 'D FEEL A LOT BETTER ABOUT THE WHOLE THING IF WE COULD SOMEHOW SHOW THAT AN EVERYDAY OBJECT ALSO FOLLOWS QUANTUM MECHANICS SO A FEW YEARS AGO I SET OFF TO DO JUST THAT
AaronOConnell_2011@204.08:207.98 SO I MADE ONE THIS IS THE FIRST OBJECT
AaronOConnell_2011@208.72:213.7 THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT HAS BEEN IN A MECHANICAL QUANTUM SUPERPOSITION
AaronOConnell_2011@253.22:261.55 THIS DEVICE HAS THE ABILITY TO BE IN A QUANTUM SUPERPOSITION BUT IT NEEDS A LITTLE HELP TO DO IT HERE LET ME GIVE YOU AN ANALOGY
AaronOConnell_2011@272.43:275.39 I DON 'T WANT TO BOTHER THEM OR FRANKLY SCARE THEM
AaronOConnell_2011@276.25:291.04 SO QUANTUM MECHANICS SAYS THAT INANIMATE OBJECTS FEEL THE SAME WAY THE FELLOW PASSENGERS FOR INANIMATE OBJECTS ARE NOT JUST PEOPLE BUT IT 'S ALSO THE LIGHT SHINING ON IT AND THE WIND BLOWING PAST IT AND THE HEAT OF THE ROOM
AaronOConnell_2011@291.04:298.95 AND SO WE KNEW IF WE WANTED TO SEE THIS PIECE OF METAL BEHAVE QUANTUM MECHANICALLY WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE TO KICK OUT ALL THE OTHER PASSENGERS AND SO THAT 'S WHAT WE DID
AaronOConnell_2011@316.13:330.75 INSTEAD OF JUST SITTING PERFECTLY STILL IT WAS VIBRATING AND THE WAY IT WAS VIBRATING WAS BREATHING SOMETHING LIKE THIS LIKE EXPANDING AND CONTRACTING BELLOWS AND BY GIVING IT A GENTLE NUDGE WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE IT BOTH VIBRATE AND NOT VIBRATE AT THE SAME TIME
AaronOConnell_2011@331.18:336.61 SOMETHING THAT 'S ONLY ALLOWED WITH QUANTUM MECHANICS SO WHAT I 'M TELLING YOU HERE IS SOMETHING TRULY
AaronOConnell_2011@366.06:372.12 WHICH IN TURN MEANS THE ENTIRE CHUNK OF METAL IS IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES I THINK THIS IS REALLY COOL
AaronOConnell_2011@400.51:402.95 THEN WHY NOT YOU
AaronOConnell_2011@406.42:409.87 SO IMAGINE IF YOU 'RE IN MULTIPLE PLACES AT THE SAME TIME
AaronOConnell_2011@413.23:419.3 HOW WOULD YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS HANDLE YOUR BODY BEING DELOCALIZED IN SPACE
AaronOConnell_2011@420.03:430.21 THERE 'S ONE MORE PART TO THE STORY IT 'S WHEN WE WARMED IT UP AND WE TURNED ON THE LIGHTS AND LOOKED INSIDE THE BOX WE SAW THAT THE PIECE METAL WAS STILL THERE IN ONE PIECE
AaronOConnell_2011@430.32:449.01 AND SO I HAD TO DEVELOP THIS NEW INTUITION THAT IT SEEMS LIKE ALL THE OBJECTS IN THE ELEVATOR ARE REALLY JUST QUANTUM OBJECTS JUST CRAMMED INTO A TINY SPACE YOU HEAR A LOT OF TALK ABOUT HOW QUANTUM MECHANICS SAYS THAT EVERYTHING IS ALL INTERCONNECTED WELL THAT 'S NOT QUITE RIGHT IT 'S MORE THAN THAT
