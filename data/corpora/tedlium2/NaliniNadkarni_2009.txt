NaliniNadkarni_2009 LIKE TO TAKE YOU ALL ON A JOURNEY UP TO THE FOREST CANOPY AND SHARE WITH YOU WHAT CANOPY RESEARCHERS ARE ASKING AND ALSO
NaliniNadkarni_2009 HOW THEY'RE COMMUNICATING WITH OTHER PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF SCIENCE LET 'S START OUR JOURNEY ON THE FOREST FLOOR OF ONE OF MY STUDY SITES IN COSTA RICA
NaliniNadkarni_2009 NOT BY PUTTING ALL OF YOU INTO ROPES AND HARNESSES BUT RATHER SHOWING YOU A VERY SHORT CLIP FROM A NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC FILM CALLED HEROES OF THE HIGH FRONTIER
NaliniNadkarni_2009 THIS WAS FILMED IN MONTEVERDE COSTA RICA AND I THINK IT GIVES US THE BEST IMPRESSION OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO CLIMB A GIANT STRANGLER FIG
NaliniNadkarni_2009 WHAT YOU'LL SEE UP THERE IS THAT IT'S REALLY LIKE THE ATMOSPHERE OF AN OPEN FIELD AND THERE ARE TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT HAVE ADAPTED TO MAKE THEIR WAY AND THEIR LIFE IN THE CANOPY
NaliniNadkarni_2009 AND TELL YOU ABOUT THE ANTS THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND SPECIES OF ANTS THAT TAXONOMISTS PEOPLE WHO DESCRIBE AND NAME ANIMALS HAVE NAMED FOUR THOUSAND OF THOSE ANTS LIVE EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FOREST CANOPY
NaliniNadkarni_2009 ONE OF THE REASONS I TELL YOU ABOUT ANTS IS BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND WHO IS IN FACT AN ANT TAXONOMIST AND WHEN WE GOT MARRIED HE PROMISED TO NAME AN ANT AFTER ME WHICH HE DID
NaliniNadkarni_2009 ANT NAMED AFTER EACH ONE OF US BUT MY
NaliniNadkarni_2009 PASSION IN ADDITION TO JACK AND MY CHILDREN ARE THE PLANTS THE SO CALLED EPIPHYTES THOSE PLANTS THAT GROW UP ON TREES THEY DON'T HAVE ROOTS THAT GO INTO TRUNKS NOR TO THE FOREST FLOOR
NaliniNadkarni_2009 BUT RATHER IT IS THEIR LEAVES THAT ARE ADAPTED TO INTERCEPT THE DISSOLVED NUTRIENTS THAT COME TO THEM IN THE FORM OF MIST AND
NaliniNadkarni_2009 ONE THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT UNDERNEATH THESE LIVE EPIPHYTES AS THEY DIE AND DECOMPOSE THEY ACTUALLY CONSTRUCT AN ARBOREAL SOIL BOTH IN THE TEMPERATE ZONE AND IN THE TROPICS
NaliniNadkarni_2009 AND THESE MOSSES GENERATED BY DECOMPOSING MAINLY MOSSES ARE LIKE PEAT MOSS IN YOUR GARDEN THEY HAVE A TREMENDOUS CAPACITY FOR HOLDING ON TO NUTRIENTS AND WATER
NaliniNadkarni_2009 ONE OF THE SURPRISING THINGS I DISCOVERED IS IF YOU PULL BACK WITH ME ON THOSE MATS OF EPIPHYTES WHAT YOU'LL FIND UNDERNEATH THEM ARE CONNECTIONS NETWORKS OF WHAT WE CALL CANOPY ROOTS
NaliniNadkarni_2009 THESE ARE NOT EPIPHYTE ROOTS THESE ARE ROOTS THAT EMERGE FROM THE TRUNK AND BRANCH OF THE HOST TREES THEMSELVES AND SO THOSE EPIPHYTES ARE ACTUALLY PAYING THE LANDLORD A BIT OF RENT IN EXCHANGE FOR BEING SUPPORTED HIGH ABOVE THE FOREST FLOOR
NaliniNadkarni_2009 I WAS INTERESTED AND MY CANOPY RESEARCHER COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN THE DYNAMICS OF THE CANOPY PLANTS THAT LIVE IN THE FOREST WE'VE DONE STRIPPING EXPERIMENTS WHERE WE'VE REMOVED MATS OF EPIPHYTES AND LOOKED AT THE RATES OF
NaliniNadkarni_2009 WE HAD PREDICTED THAT THEY WOULD GROW BACK VERY QUICKLY AND THAT THEY WOULD COME IN ENCROACHING FROM THE SIDE WHAT WE FOUND HOWEVER WAS THAT THEY TOOK AN EXTREMELY LONG TIME OVER TWENTY YEARS TO REGENERATE
NaliniNadkarni_2009 AND I USE THIS LITTLE IMAGE TO SAY THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO MOSSES IF IT'S GONE IT'S GONE AND IF YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY YOU MIGHT GET SOMETHING GROWING BACK FROM THE BOTTOM
NaliniNadkarni_2009 SO RECOLONIZATION IS REALLY VERY SLOW THESE CANOPY COMMUNITIES ARE FRAGILE
NaliniNadkarni_2009 WELL WHEN WE LOOK OUT YOU AND I OVER THAT CANOPY OF THE INTACT PRIMARY FOREST WHAT WE SEE IS THIS ENORMOUS CARPET OF CARBON
NaliniNadkarni_2009 ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT CANOPY RESEARCHERS ARE ATTACKING TODAY IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE AMOUNT OF CARBON THAT IS BEING SEQUESTERED WE KNOW IT'S A LOT BUT WE DO NOT YET KNOW
NaliniNadkarni_2009 THE ANSWERS TO HOW MUCH AND BY WHAT PROCESSES CARBON IS BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE HELD IN ITS BIOMASS AND MOVING ON THROUGH THE ECOSYSTEM
NaliniNadkarni_2009 SO I HOPE I'VE SHOWED YOU THAT CANOPY DWELLERS ARE NOT JUST INSIGNIFICANT BITS OF GREEN UP HIGH IN THE CANOPY THAT TARZAN AND JANE WERE INTERESTED IN
NaliniNadkarni_2009 BUT RATHER THAT THEY FOSTER BIODIVERSITY CONTRIBUTE TO ECOSYSTEM NUTRIENT CYCLES AND THEY ALSO HELP TO KEEP OUR
NaliniNadkarni_2009 UP IN THE CANOPY IF YOU WERE SITTING NEXT TO ME IF YOU TURNED AROUND FROM THOSE PRIMARY FOREST ECOSYSTEMS YOU WOULD ALSO SEE SCENES LIKE THIS
NaliniNadkarni_2009 SCENES OF FOREST DESTRUCTION FOREST HARVESTING AND FOREST FRAGMENTATION THEREBY MAKING THAT INTACT TAPESTRY OF THE CANOPY
NaliniNadkarni_2009 UNABLE TO FUNCTION IN THE MARVELOUS WAYS THAT IT HAS WHEN IT IS NOT DISTURBED BY HUMANS I'VE ALSO LOOKED OUT ON URBAN PLACES LIKE THIS AND THOUGHT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE DISASSOCIATED FROM TREES IN THEIR LIVES
NaliniNadkarni_2009 THIS TROUBLES ME HERE
NaliniNadkarni_2009 TWO THOUSAND AND NINE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO BE A FOREST ECOLOGIST GRIPPING OURSELVES WITH THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN ANSWER THEM
NaliniNadkarni_2009 WELL I THINK THAT I CAN DO SOMETHING I KNOW THAT AS A SCIENTIST I HAVE INFORMATION AND AS A HUMAN BEING I CAN COMMUNICATE WITH ANYBODY
NaliniNadkarni_2009 WE CONSULT TO THE MEDIA ABOUT CANOPY QUESTIONS WE HAVE A CANOPY NEWSLETTER WE HAVE AN EMAIL LISTSERV AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO DISSEMINATE INFORMATION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CANOPY THE BEAUTY OF THE CANOPY THE NECESSITY OF INTACT CANOPIES
NaliniNadkarni_2009 TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF ACADEMIA WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT A LOT OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WE MAKE THOSE VIDEOS AND SO FORTH
NaliniNadkarni_2009 KNOW THEY DON'T REACH EVERYBODY AND SO WE'VE BEEN FOSTERING PROJECTS THAT REACH PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF ACADEMIA AND OUTSIDE OF THE CHOIR THAT MOST ECOLOGISTS PREACH TO TREETOP BARBIE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT
NaliniNadkarni_2009 WHAT WE DO MY STUDENTS IN MY LAB AND I IS WE BUY BARBIES FROM GOODWILL AND VALUE VILLAGE WE DRESS HER IN CLOTHES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY SEAMSTRESSES AND WE SEND HER OUT WITH A CANOPY HANDBOOK
NaliniNadkarni_2009 AND MY FEELING IS THANK YOU
NaliniNadkarni_2009 TAKEN THIS POP ICON AND WE HAVE JUST TWEAKED HER A LITTLE BIT TO BECOME AN AMBASSADOR WHO CAN CARRY THE MESSAGE THAT BEING A WOMAN SCIENTIST STUDYING TREETOPS IS ACTUALLY A REALLY GREAT THING
NaliniNadkarni_2009 WHAT I DO IS I BRING TOGETHER SCIENTISTS AND ARTISTS OF ALL KINDS WE SPEND A WEEK IN THE FOREST ON THESE LITTLE PLATFORMS AND WE LOOK AT NATURE WE LOOK AT TREES WE LOOK AT THE CANOPY AND WE COMMUNICATE AND EXCHANGE AND EXPRESS WHAT WE SEE TOGETHER
NaliniNadkarni_2009 THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC I'LL JUST GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES THIS IS A FANTASTIC INSTALLATION BY BRUCE CHAO WHO IS CHAIR OF THE SCULPTURE AND GLASS BLOWING DEPARTMENT AT
NaliniNadkarni_2009 RHODE ISLAND SCHOOL OF DESIGN HE SAW NESTS IN THE CANOPY AT ONE OF OUR CANOPY CONFLUENCES IN THE
NaliniNadkarni_2009 WE'VE HAD DANCE PEOPLE UP IN THE CANOPY JODI LOMASK AND HER WONDERFUL TROUPE CAPACITOR JOINED ME IN THE CANOPY IN MY RAINFOREST SITE IN COSTA RICA
NaliniNadkarni_2009 MADE A FABULOUS DANCE CALLED BIOME THEY DANCED IN THE FOREST AND WE ARE TAKING THIS DANCE MY SCIENTIFIC OUTREACH
NaliniNadkarni_2009 WE BROUGHT MUSICIANS TO THE CANOPY AND THEY MADE THEIR MUSIC AND IT'S FANTASTIC MUSIC WE HAD WOODEN FLUTISTS WE HAD OBOISTS WE HAD OPERA SINGERS WE HAD GUITAR PLAYERS AND WE HAD RAP SINGERS AND I BROUGHT A LITTLE SEGMENT TO GIVE YOU OF DUKE BRADY 'S CANOPY RAP
NaliniNadkarni_2009 DUKE
NaliniNadkarni_2009 SO I ENGAGED CAUTION THIS RAP SINGER WITH A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE FROM INNER CITY TAKOMA WE WENT OUT TO THE FOREST I WOULD PICK UP A BRANCH CAUTION WOULD RAP ON IT
NaliniNadkarni_2009 AND SUDDENLY THAT BRANCH WAS REALLY COOL AND THEN THE STUDENTS WOULD COME INTO OUR SOUND STUDIOS THEY WOULD MAKE THEIR OWN RAP SONGS WITH THEIR OWN BEATS
NaliniNadkarni_2009 THEY ENDED UP MAKING A CD WHICH THEY TOOK HOME TO THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS THEREBY EXPRESSING THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES WITH NATURE IN THEIR OWN MEDIUM
NaliniNadkarni_2009 THE FINAL PROJECT I'LL TALK ABOUT IS ONE THAT'S VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART AND IT INVOLVES AN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL VALUE THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH EPIPHYTIC
NaliniNadkarni_2009 IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST THERE'S A WHOLE INDUSTRY OF MOSS HARVESTING FROM OLD GROWTH FORESTS THESE MOSSES ARE TAKEN FROM THE FOREST THEY'RE USED BY THE FLORACULTURE INDUSTRY BY FLORISTS
NaliniNadkarni_2009 TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS AND MAKE HANGING BASKETS IT'S A TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY AND IT'S INCREASING RAPIDLY
NaliniNadkarni_2009 I AS AN ECOLOGIST DO ABOUT THAT WELL MY THOUGHT WAS THAT I COULD LEARN HOW TO GROW MOSSES AND THAT WAY WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO TAKE THEM OUT OF THE WILD
NaliniNadkarni_2009 AND I THOUGHT IF I HAD SOME PARTNERS THAT COULD HELP ME WITH THIS THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND SO I THOUGHT PERHAPS INCARCERATED MEN AND WOMEN
NaliniNadkarni_2009 WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO NATURE WHO OFTEN HAVE A LOT OF TIME THEY OFTEN HAVE SPACE AND YOU DON'T NEED ANY SHARP TOOLS TO WORK WITH MOSSES WOULD BE GREAT
NaliniNadkarni_2009 AND THEY EMBRACED THE IDEA THAT THEY COULD HELP DEVELOP A RESEARCH DESIGN IN ORDER TO GROW THESE MOSSES WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL
NaliniNadkarni_2009 AS PARTNERS IN FIGURING OUT WHICH SPECIES GROW THE FASTEST AND I'VE JUST BEEN OVERWHELMED WITH HOW SUCCESSFUL THIS HAS BEEN BECAUSE
NaliniNadkarni_2009 WE GAVE TALKS ONCE A MONTH AND THAT ACTUALLY ENDED UP IMPLEMENTING SOME AMAZING SUSTAINABILITY PROJECTS AT THE PRISONS ORGANIC GARDENS WORM CULTURE RECYCLING WATER CATCHMENT
NaliniNadkarni_2009 AND BEEKEEPING OUR LATEST ENDEAVOR
NaliniNadkarni_2009 WITH A GRANT WITH A GRANT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AT WASHINGTON STATE THEY'VE ASKED US TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM TO THREE MORE PRISONS
NaliniNadkarni_2009 AND OUR NEW PROJECT IS HAVING THE INMATES AND OURSELVES LEARN HOW TO RAISE THE OREGON SPOTTED FROG WHICH IS A HIGHLY ENDANGERED AMPHIBIAN IN WASHINGTON STATE AND OREGON SO THEY WILL RAISE THEM IN CAPTIVITY OF COURSE FROM
NaliniNadkarni_2009 EGGS TO TADPOLES AND ONWARD TO FROGS
NaliniNadkarni_2009 THEY WILL HAVE THE PLEASURE MANY OF THEM OF SEEING THOSE FROGS THAT THEY'VE RAISED FROM EGGS AND HELPED DEVELOP HELPED NURTURE MOVE OUT INTO PROTECTED WILDLANDS TO AUGMENT THE NUMBER OF ENDANGERED SPECIES
NaliniNadkarni_2009 OUT THERE IN THE WILD AND SO I THINK FOR MANY REASONS ECOLOGICAL SOCIAL ECONOMIC AND PERHAPS EVEN SPIRITUAL THIS HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS PROJECT AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO
NaliniNadkarni_2009 NOT ONLY MYSELF AND MY STUDENTS DOING IT BUT ALSO TO PROMOTE AND TEACH OTHER SCIENTISTS HOW TO DO THIS
NaliniNadkarni_2009 AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE THE WORLD OF ACADEMIA IS A RATHER INWARD LOOKING ONE I'M TRYING TO HELP RESEARCHERS MOVE MORE OUTWARD TO HAVE THEIR OWN PARTNERSHIPS WITH
NaliniNadkarni_2009 AND BILL GATES COULD GET TOGETHER AND MAKE AN OPERA ABOUT AIDS OR PERHAPS AL GORE AND NATURALLY SEVEN COULD MAKE A SONG ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WOULD REALLY MAKE YOU CLAP YOUR HANDS
NaliniNadkarni_2009 SO ALTHOUGH ITS A LITTLE BIT OF A FANTASY I THINK ITS ALSO A REALITY GIVEN THE DURESS THAT WE'RE FEELING ENVIRONMENTALLY IN THESE TIMES IT IS TIME FOR SCIENTISTS TO REACH OUTWARD AND TIME FOR THOSE OUTSIDE OF SCIENCE TO REACH TOWARDS ACADEMIA AS WELL
NaliniNadkarni_2009 I STARTED MY CAREER
NaliniNadkarni_2009 WITH TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE MYSTERIES OF FORESTS WITH THE TOOLS OF SCIENCE BY MAKING THESE PARTNERSHIPS THAT I DESCRIBED TO YOU
NaliniNadkarni_2009 I HAVE REALLY OPENED MY MIND AND I HAVE TO SAY MY HEART TO HAVE A GREATER UNDERSTANDING TO MAKE OTHER DISCOVERIES ABOUT NATURE AND MYSELF
NaliniNadkarni_2009 WHEN I LOOK INTO MY HEART I SEE TREES THIS IS ACTUALLY AN IMAGE OF A REAL HEART THERE ARE TREES IN OUR HEARTS
NaliniNadkarni_2009 THERE ARE TREES IN YOUR HEARTS WHEN WE COME TO UNDERSTAND NATURE WE ARE TOUCHING THE MOST DEEP THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF OUR SELF
NaliniNadkarni_2009 IN THESE PARTNERSHIPS I HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT PEOPLE TEND TO COMPARTMENTALIZE THEMSELVES INTO IT PEOPLE AND MOVIE STAR PEOPLE
NaliniNadkarni_2009 AND SCIENTISTS BUT WHEN WE SHARE NATURE WHEN WE SHARE OUR PERSPECTIVES ABOUT NATURE WE FIND A COMMON DENOMINATOR
NaliniNadkarni_2009 AS A SCIENTIST AND AS A PERSON AND NOW AS
NaliniNadkarni_2009 PART OF THE TED COMMUNITY
NaliniNadkarni_2009 I FEEL THAT I HAVE BETTER TOOLS TO GO OUT TO TREES TO GO OUT TO FOREST TO GO OUT TO NATURE TO MAKE NEW DISCOVERIES ABOUT NATURE AND ABOUT HUMANS PLACE IN NATURE WHEREVER
NaliniNadkarni_2009 AND WHOMEVER YOU ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
