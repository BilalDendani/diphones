SophalEar_2009U I NORMALLY TEACH COURSES ON HOW TO REBUILD STATES AFTER WAR BUT TODAY I'VE GOT A PERSONAL STORY TO SHARE WITH YOU
SophalEar_2009U APRIL
SophalEar_2009U LED BY PEASANT BORN POL POT THE KHMER ROUGE EVACUATES PEOPLE TO THE
SophalEar_2009U IN ORDER TO CREATE A RURAL COMMUNIST UTOPIA MUCH LIKE MAO TSE TSUNG 'S CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN CHINA
SophalEar_2009U ROUGE CLOSES THE DOORS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD BUT AFTER FOUR YEARS THE GRIM TRUTH SEEPS
SophalEar_2009U IN A COUNTRY OF ONLY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE ONE AND A HALF MILLION WERE MURDERED BY
SophalEar_2009U THEIR BODIES PILED IN THE MASS GRAVES OF
SophalEar_2009U MY PARENTS WERE TOLD BY THE KHMER ROUGE TO EVACUATE THE CITY BECAUSE OF IMPENDING AMERICAN BOMBING FOR THREE DAYS AND HERE IS A PICTURE OF THE KHMER ROUGE THEY WERE YOUNG SOLDIERS TYPICALLY
SophalEar_2009U THE KHMER ROUGE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN MONEY SO THE EQUIVALENT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK IN CAMBODIA WAS BOMBED BUT NOT JUST THAT THEY ACTUALLY
SophalEar_2009U BANNED MONEY I THINK IT'S THE ONLY PRECEDENT IN WHICH MONEY HAS EVER BEEN STOPPED FROM BEING USED AND WE KNOW MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL BUT IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY STOP EVIL FROM HAPPENING IN CAMBODIA IN FACT
SophalEar_2009U MY FAMILY WAS MOVED FROM PHNOM PENH TO PURSAT PROVINCE THIS IS A PICTURE OF WHAT PURSAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY PRETTY AREA OF CAMBODIA
SophalEar_2009U WHERE RICE GROWING TAKES PLACE AND IN FACT THEY WERE FORCED TO WORK THE FIELDS SO MY FATHER AND MOTHER ENDED UP
SophalEar_2009U IN A SORT OF CONCENTRATION CAMP LABOR CAMP AND IT WAS AT THAT TIME THAT MY MOTHER GOT WORD FROM THE COMMUNE CHIEF THAT THE VIETNAMESE WERE ACTUALLY ASKING FOR THEIR CITIZENS TO GO BACK TO VIETNAM
SophalEar_2009U AND SHE SPOKE SOME VIETNAMESE AS A CHILD HAVING GROWN UP WITH VIETNAMESE FRIENDS AND SHE DECIDED
SophalEar_2009U IN A MODERN DAY CALORIC RESTRICTION DIET I GUESS THEY'RE GIVING PORRIDGE WITH A FEW GRAINS OF RICE AND AT ABOUT THIS TIME ACTUALLY MY FATHER GOT VERY SICK
SophalEar_2009U SO THE KHMER ROUGE TOOK US FROM A PLACE CALLED PURSAT TO KOH TIEV WHICH IS ACROSS FROM THE BORDER FROM VIETNAM AND THERE THEY HAD A DETENTION CAMP WHERE
SophalEar_2009U OUR STORY MORE CREDIBLE SHE'D GIVEN ALL THE BOYS AND GIRLS NEW VIETNAMESE NAMES BUT SHE'D GIVEN THE BOYS GIRLS NAMES AND THE GIRLS
SophalEar_2009U BOYS NAMES AND IT WASN'T UNTIL SHE MET A VIETNAMESE LADY WHO TOLD HER THIS AND THEN TUTORED HER FOR TWO DAYS INTENSIVELY THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO GO INTO HER EXAM
SophalEar_2009U AND YOU KNOW THIS WAS A MOMENT OF TRUTH IF SHE FAILS WE'RE ALL HEADED TO THE GALLOWS IF SHE PASSES WE CAN LEAVE TO VIETNAM AND SHE ACTUALLY OF COURSE I'M HERE SHE PASSES
SophalEar_2009U AND WE END UP IN HONG NGU ON THE VIETNAMESE SIDE AND THEN ONWARDS TO CHAU DOC AND THIS IS A PICTURE OF HONG NGU VIETNAM TODAY A PRETTY
SophalEar_2009U IDYLLIC PLACE ON THE MEKONG DELTA BUT FOR US IT MEANT FREEDOM AND FREEDOM FROM PERSECUTION FROM THE KHMER ROUGE
SophalEar_2009U LAST YEAR THE KHMER ROUGE TRIBUNAL WHICH THE U N IS HELPING CAMBODIA TAKE ON STARTED AND I DECIDED THAT AS A MATTER OF RECORD I SHOULD FILE A CIVIL COMPLAINT WITH THE TRIBUNAL ABOUT MY FATHER 'S PASSING AWAY AND
SophalEar_2009U I GOT WORD LAST MONTH THAT THE COMPLAINT WAS OFFICIALLY ACCEPTED BY THE KHMER ROUGE TRIBUNAL AND IT'S FOR ME A MATTER OF JUSTICE FOR HISTORY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE CAMBODIA REMAINS A PRETTY
