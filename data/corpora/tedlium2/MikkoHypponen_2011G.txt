MikkoHypponen_2011G@192.02:198.45 SITTING DOWN IS HIS BROTHER AMJAD THESE ARE THE GUYS WHO WROTE THE FIRST PC VIRUS NOW OF COURSE
MikkoHypponen_2011G@198.91:205.49 WE HAD A VERY INTERESTING DISCUSSION I ASKED THEM WHY I ASKED THEM HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT WHAT THEY STARTED
MikkoHypponen_2011G@243.24:252.54 MOUNT SOME DRIVES GO OVER THERE WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A LIST OF OLD VIRUSES SO LET ME JUST RUN SOME VIRUSES ON MY COMPUTER FOR EXAMPLE
MikkoHypponen_2011G@288:297.96 SO IT USED TO BE FAIRLY EASY TO KNOW THAT YOU 'RE INFECTED BY A VIRUS WHEN THE VIRUSES WERE WRITTEN BY HOBBYISTS AND TEENAGERS
MikkoHypponen_2011G@297.96:302.84 TODAY THEY ARE NO LONGER BEING WRITTEN BY HOBBYISTS AND TEENAGERS
MikkoHypponen_2011G@302.84:320.6 TODAY VIRUSES ARE A GLOBAL PROBLEM WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE BACKGROUND IS AN EXAMPLE OF OUR SYSTEMS THAT WE RUN IN OUR LABS WHERE WE TRACK VIRUS INFECTIONS WORLDWIDE SO WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE IN REAL TIME THAT WE 'VE JUST BLOCKED VIRUSES IN SWEDEN AND TAIWAN AND RUSSIA AND ELSEWHERE IN FACT
MikkoHypponen_2011G@320.9:323.62 IF I JUST CONNECT BACK TO OUR LAB SYSTEMS
MikkoHypponen_2011G@323.62:337.77 THROUGH THE WEB WE CAN SEE IN REAL TIME JUST SOME KIND OF IDEA OF HOW MANY VIRUSES HOW MANY NEW EXAMPLES OF MALWARE WE FIND EVERY SINGLE DAY HERE 'S THE LATEST VIRUS WE 'VE FOUND IN A FILE CALLED SERVER EXE AND WE FOUND IT
MikkoHypponen_2011G@345.88:353.91 IT 'S JUST MASSIVE WE FIND TENS OF THOUSANDS EVEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AND THAT 'S THE LAST TWENTY MINUTES OF MALWARE EVERY SINGLE DAY
MikkoHypponen_2011G@370.2:374.47 THIS IS A WEBSITE OPERATING IN MOSCOW WHERE
MikkoHypponen_2011G@374.47:391 THESE GUYS ARE BUYING INFECTED COMPUTERS SO IF YOU ARE A VIRUS WRITER AND YOU 'RE CAPABLE OF INFECTING WINDOWS COMPUTERS BUT YOU DON 'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM YOU CAN SELL THOSE INFECTED COMPUTERS SOMEBODY ELSE 'S COMPUTERS TO THESE GUYS AND THEY 'LL ACTUALLY PAY YOU MONEY FOR THOSE COMPUTERS
MikkoHypponen_2011G@391:396.56 SO HOW DO THESE GUYS THEN MONETIZE THOSE INFECTED COMPUTERS
MikkoHypponen_2011G@396.56:414.08 WELL THERE 'S MULTIPLE DIFFERENT WAYS SUCH AS BANKING TROJANS WHICH WILL STEAL MONEY FROM YOUR ONLINE BANKING ACCOUNTS WHEN YOU DO ONLINE BANKING OR KEYLOGGERS KEYLOGGERS SILENTLY SIT ON YOUR COMPUTER HIDDEN FROM VIEW AND THEY RECORD EVERYTHING YOU TYPE
MikkoHypponen_2011G@414.23:428.67 SO YOU 'RE SITTING ON YOUR COMPUTER AND YOU 'RE DOING GOOGLE SEARCHES EVERY SINGLE GOOGLE SEARCH YOU TYPE IS SAVED AND SENT TO THE CRIMINALS EVERY SINGLE EMAIL YOU WRITE IS SAVED AND SENT TO THE CRIMINALS SAME THING WITH EVERY SINGLE PASSWORD AND SO ON
MikkoHypponen_2011G@445.54:461.74 HERE 'S AN EXAMPLE OF A FILE WE FOUND FROM A SERVER A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THAT 'S THE CREDIT CARD NUMBER THAT 'S THE EXPIRATION DATE THAT 'S THE SECURITY CODE AND THAT 'S THE NAME OF THE OWNER OF THE CARD ONCE YOU GAIN ACCESS TO OTHER PEOPLE 'S CREDIT CARD INFORMATION YOU CAN JUST GO ONLINE AND BUY WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH THIS INFORMATION
MikkoHypponen_2011G@461.74:473.21 AND THAT OBVIOUSLY IS A PROBLEM WE NOW HAVE A WHOLE UNDERGROUND MARKETPLACE AND BUSINESS ECOSYSTEM BUILT AROUND ONLINE CRIME
MikkoHypponen_2011G@495.1:502.58 THESE GUYS WERE RUNNING AN OPERATION CALLED I M U A CYBERCRIME OPERATION THROUGH WHICH THEY NETTED MILLIONS THEY ARE BOTH
