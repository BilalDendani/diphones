AdamGarone_2011X THINK THE BEAUTIFUL MALIN AKERMAN PUT IT PERFECTLY EVERY MAN DESERVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW A LITTLE BIT OF LUXURY
AdamGarone_2011X AND HOW THROUGH THAT JOURNEY WE 'VE REDEFINED CHARITY WE 'RE REDEFINING THE WAY PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCHERS ARE WORKING TOGETHER THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND I HOPE THROUGH THAT PROCESS
AdamGarone_2011X THAT I INSPIRE YOU TO CREATE SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT IN YOUR LIFE SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT THAT WILL GO ON AND MAKE THIS WORLD A BETTER PLACE
AdamGarone_2011X SO
AdamGarone_2011X THE MOST COMMON QUESTION I GET ASKED AND I 'M GOING TO ANSWER IT NOW SO I DON 'T HAVE TO DO IT OVER DRINKS TONIGHT
AdamGarone_2011X NORMALLY A CHARITY STARTS WITH THE CAUSE AND SOMEONE THAT IS DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY A CAUSE THEY THEN GO ON TO CREATE AN EVENT AND BEYOND THAT A FOUNDATION TO SUPPORT THAT PRETTY MUCH IN EVERY CASE THAT 'S HOW A CHARITY STARTS
AdamGarone_2011X ROCK A MUSTACHE NOT A BEARD NOT A GOATEE A MUSTACHE FOR THE THIRTY DAYS OF NOVEMBER AND THEN WE AGREED THAT WE WOULD COME TOGETHER AT THE END OF THE MONTH HAVE A MUSTACHE THEMED PARTY
AdamGarone_2011X AND AWARD A PRIZE FOR THE BEST AND OF COURSE THE WORST MUSTACHE
AdamGarone_2011X HIPSTER MUSTACHE
AdamGarone_2011X IT CREATED A LOT OF CONTROVERSY
AdamGarone_2011X HATED IT PARENTS WOULD SHUFFLE KIDS AWAY FROM
AdamGarone_2011X WE CAME TOGETHER AT THE END OF THE MONTH AND WE CELEBRATED OUR JOURNEY AND IT WAS A REAL JOURNEY AND WE HAD A LOT OF FUN AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR I SAID TO THE GUYS THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN WE NEED TO LEGITIMIZE THIS SO WE CAN GET AWAY WITH IT YEAR ON YEAR
AdamGarone_2011X SO WE MARRIED GROWING A MUSTACHE WITH PROSTATE CANCER AND THEN WE CREATED OUR TAGLINE WHICH IS CHANGING THE FACE OF MEN 'S HEALTH AND THAT ELOQUENTLY DESCRIBES THE CHALLENGE CHANGING YOUR APPEARANCE FOR THE THIRTY DAYS AND ALSO THE OUTCOME THAT WE 'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE GETTING MEN ENGAGED IN THEIR HEALTH
AdamGarone_2011X THE CEO OF THE PROSTATE CANCER FOUNDATION
AdamGarone_2011X I SAID TO HIM I 'VE GOT THE MOST AMAZING IDEA THAT 'S GOING TO TRANSFORM YOUR ORGANIZATION
AdamGarone_2011X AND FUNDS FOR HIS ORGANIZATION
AdamGarone_2011X AND I SAID WE 'RE GOING TO COME TOGETHER AT THE END WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE A MUSTACHE THEMED PARTY WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE DJS WE 'RE GOING TO CELEBRATE LIFE AND WE 'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE FACE OF MEN 'S HEALTH AND HE JUST LOOKED AT ME AND LAUGHED AND HE SAID
AdamGarone_2011X BUT WE 'RE AN ULTRACONSERVATIVE ORGANIZATION WE CAN 'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU
AdamGarone_2011X SO MY LESSON THAT YEAR WAS PERSISTENCE AND WE PERSISTED AND WE GOT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY
AdamGarone_2011X GUYS GROWING MUSTACHES
AdamGarone_2011X AND TOGETHER WE RAISED FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WE DONATED EVERY CENT OF THAT TO THE PROSTATE CANCER FOUNDATION OF AUSTRALIA AND THAT REPRESENTED AT THE TIME THE SINGLE BIGGEST DONATION THEY 'D EVER RECEIVED
AdamGarone_2011X SO FROM THAT DAY FORWARD MY LIFE HAS BECOME ABOUT A MUSTACHE
AdamGarone_2011X EVERY DAY THIS MORNING I WAKE UP AND GO MY LIFE IS ABOUT A MUSTACHE
AdamGarone_2011X AND THEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WE CAME TO A PIVOTAL POINT
AdamGarone_2011X IT WAS CONSUMING SO MUCH OF OUR TIME AFTER HOURS ON WEEKENDS
AdamGarone_2011X THAT WE THOUGHT WE EITHER NEED TO CLOSE THIS DOWN OR FIGURE A WAY TO FUND MOVEMBER SO THAT I COULD QUIT MY JOB AND GO AND SPEND MORE TIME IN THE ORGANIZATION AND TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL IT 'S REALLY INTERESTING WHEN YOU TRY AND FIGURE A WAY TO FUND A FUNDRAISING ORGANIZATION BUILT OFF GROWING MUSTACHES
AdamGarone_2011X SO WE 'D RACKED UP AT THIS STAGE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF DEBT SO IF MOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND SIX DIDN 'T HAPPEN THE FOUR FOUNDERS
AdamGarone_2011X WELL WE WOULD 'VE BEEN BROKE WE WOULD 'VE BEEN HOMELESS SITTING ON THE STREET WITH MUSTACHES
AdamGarone_2011X SO WHAT WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF FUN DOING IT AND IT TAUGHT US THE IMPORTANCE OF TAKING RISKS AND REALLY SMART RISKS
AdamGarone_2011X THEN IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN A REALLY INTERESTING THING HAPPENED WE HAD MO BROS FROM CANADA FROM THE U S AND FROM THE U K EMAILING US AND CALLING US AND SAYING HEY THERE 'S NOTHING FOR PROSTATE CANCER BRING THIS CAMPAIGN TO THESE COUNTRIES
AdamGarone_2011X SO WE THOUGHT WHY NOT LET 'S DO IT
AdamGarone_2011X SO I COLD CALLED THE CEO OF PROSTATE CANCER CANADA AND I SAID TO HIM I HAVE THIS MOST AMAZING CONCEPT
AdamGarone_2011X IT 'S GOING TO TRANSFORM YOUR ORGANIZATION I DON 'T WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT NOW BUT WILL YOU MEET WITH ME
AdamGarone_2011X MUSTACHES ALL ACROSS CANADA RAISING AWARENESS AND FUNDS FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION
AdamGarone_2011X BUT HE SAID WE WILL PARTNER WITH YOU
AdamGarone_2011X BUT WE 'RE NOT GOING TO INVEST IN IT YOU NEED TO FIGURE A WAY TO BRING THIS CAMPAIGN ACROSS HERE AND MAKE IT WORK SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE TOOK SOME OF THE MONEY THAT WE RAISED IN AUSTRALIA TO BRING THE
AdamGarone_2011X CAMPAIGN ACROSS TO THIS COUNTRY THE U S AND THE U K AND WE DID THAT BECAUSE WE KNEW IF THIS WAS SUCCESSFUL WE COULD RAISE INFINITELY MORE MONEY GLOBALLY THAN WE COULD JUST IN AUSTRALIA AND THAT MONEY FUELS RESEARCH AND THAT RESEARCH WILL GET US TO
AdamGarone_2011X SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
AdamGarone_2011X WE BROUGHT THE CAMPAIGN ACROSS HERE AND IT WAS IT SET THE STAGE
AdamGarone_2011X WHAT I 'M REALLY PLEASED TO SAY IS IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN MOVEMBER BECAME A TRULY GLOBAL MOVEMENT CANADA WAS JUST PIPPED TO THE POST IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER ONE FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGN IN THE WORLD LAST YEAR
AdamGarone_2011X WE HAD FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND MO BROS SPREAD ACROSS THE WORLD AND TOGETHER WE RAISED SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS
AdamGarone_2011X AND THAT MAKES MOVEMBER NOW THE BIGGEST FUNDER OF PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS IN THE WORLD AND THAT IS AN AMAZING ACHIEVEMENT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT US GROWING MUSTACHES
AdamGarone_2011X OUR AMBASSADORS ARE THE MO BROS AND THE MO SISTAS AND I THINK THAT 'S BEEN FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR SUCCESS WE HAND ACROSS OUR BRAND AND OUR CAMPAIGN TO THOSE PEOPLE WE LET THEM EMBRACE IT AND INTERPRET IT IN THEIR OWN WAY
AdamGarone_2011X AND I SAY TO THEM LAST YEAR WE WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CELEBRITY AMBASSADORS AND THEY GO WHAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN AND IT 'S LIKE EVERYTHING SINGLE PERSON EVERY SINGLE MO BRO AND MO SISTA THAT PARTICIPATES IN MOVEMBER IS OUR CELEBRITY AMBASSADOR AND THAT IS SO SO IMPORTANT AND FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR SUCCESS
AdamGarone_2011X NOW WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU IS ONE OF MY MOST TOUCHING
AdamGarone_2011X IS MY TRIBUTE TO MY MOM AND WE SORT OF ALL CHOKED UP IN THE BACK OF THE TAXI
AdamGarone_2011X AND I DIDN 'T TELL HIM WHO I WAS BECAUSE I DIDN 'T THINK IT WAS APPROPRIATE AND I JUST SHOOK HIS HAND AND I SAID THANK YOU SO MUCH YOUR MOM WOULD BE SO PROUD AND FROM THAT MOMENT I REALIZED THAT MOVEMBER IS SO MUCH MORE THAN A MUSTACHE HAVING A JOKE IT 'S ABOUT EACH PERSON
AdamGarone_2011X COMING TO THIS PLATFORM EMBRACING IT IN THEIR OWN WAY AND BEING SIGNIFICANT IN THEIR OWN LIFE
AdamGarone_2011X FOR US NOW AT MOVEMBER WE REALLY FOCUS ON THREE PROGRAM AREAS AND HAVING A TRUE IMPACT
AdamGarone_2011X AWARENESS AND EDUCATION
AdamGarone_2011X SURVIVOR SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH NOW WE ALWAYS FOCUS NATURALLY ON HOW MUCH WE RAISE BECAUSE IT 'S A VERY TANGIBLE OUTCOME BUT FOR ME AWARENESS AND EDUCATION
AdamGarone_2011X AND I SAID WHAT 'S YOUR MOVEMBER STORY AND HE SAID I GREW THE WORST MUSTACHE EVER
AdamGarone_2011X I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH MY DAD ONE ON ONE ABOUT MEN 'S HEALTH I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH MY DAD ABOUT PROSTATE CANCER AND I LEARNED THAT MY GRANDFATHER HAD PROSTATE CANCER
AdamGarone_2011X AND I WAS ABLE TO
AdamGarone_2011X SHARE WITH MY DAD THAT HE WAS TWICE AS LIKELY TO GET THAT DISEASE AND HE DIDN 'T KNOW THAT AND HE HADN 'T BEEN GETTING SCREENED FOR IT SO NOW THAT GUY IS GETTING SCREENED FOR PROSTATE CANCER SO THOSE CONVERSATIONS GETTING MEN ENGAGED IN THIS AT WHATEVER AGE IS SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT
AdamGarone_2011X NOW TO THE FUNDS WE RAISE AND RESEARCH AND HOW WE 'RE REDEFINING
AdamGarone_2011X RESEARCH WE FUND PROSTATE CANCER FOUNDATIONS NOW IN THIRTEEN COUNTRIES WE LITERALLY FUND HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF INSTITUTIONS AND RESEARCHERS AROUND THE WORLD AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT THIS MORE RECENTLY
AdamGarone_2011X WE REALIZED THERE 'S A REAL LACK OF COLLABORATION GOING ON EVEN WITHIN INSTITUTIONS LET ALONE NATIONALLY LET ALONE GLOBALLY AND THIS IS NOT UNIQUE TO PROSTATE CANCER THIS IS CANCER RESEARCH THE WORLD OVER
AdamGarone_2011X AND SO WE SAID RIGHT WE 'D REDEFINED CHARITY WE NEED TO REDEFINE THE WAY THESE GUYS OPERATE HOW DO WE DO THAT SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE CREATED A GLOBAL ACTION PLAN AND WE 'RE TAKING TEN PERCENT OF WHAT 'S RAISED IN EACH COUNTRY NOW AND PUTTING IT INTO A GLOBAL FUND AND WE 'VE GOT THE BEST PROSTATE CANCER SCIENTIFIC MINDS IN THE WORLD THAT LOOK AFTER THAT FUND
AdamGarone_2011X AND THEY COME TOGETHER EACH YEAR AND IDENTIFY THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY
AdamGarone_2011X AND THAT LAST YEAR WAS GETTING A BETTER SCREENING TEST SO THEY
AdamGarone_2011X WITH A REALLY CREATIVE IDEA
AdamGarone_2011X WITH PASSION WITH PERSISTENCE AND A LOT OF PATIENCE FOUR MATES FOUR MUSTACHES CAN INSPIRE A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE AND THAT ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE
AdamGarone_2011X CAN GO ON AND INSPIRE A CITY AND THAT CITY IS MELBOURNE MY HOME AND THAT CITY
