ShaneKoyczan_2013@24.45:27.32 WHEN I WAS A KID
ShaneKoyczan_2013@27.32:46.81 I HID MY HEART UNDER THE BED BECAUSE MY MOTHER SAID IF YOU 'RE NOT CAREFUL SOMEDAY SOMEONE 'S GOING TO BREAK IT TAKE IT FROM ME UNDER THE BED IS NOT A GOOD HIDING SPOT I KNOW BECAUSE I 'VE BEEN SHOT DOWN SO MANY TIMES I GET ALTITUDE SICKNESS JUST FROM STANDING UP FOR MYSELF BUT THAT 'S WHAT WE WERE TOLD STAND UP FOR YOURSELF
ShaneKoyczan_2013@65.57:74.69 WE WERE BEING ASKED WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WAS AN UNFAIR QUESTION IT PRESUPPOSES THAT WE CAN 'T BE WHAT WE ALREADY ARE
ShaneKoyczan_2013@75.25:79.22 WE WERE KIDS WHEN I WAS A KID I WANTED TO BE A MAN
ShaneKoyczan_2013@80.14:85.59 I WANTED A REGISTERED RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN THAT WOULD KEEP ME IN CANDY LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE OLD AGE SWEET
ShaneKoyczan_2013@86.76:89.39 WHEN I WAS A KID I WANTED TO SHAVE
ShaneKoyczan_2013@92.44:100.3 WHEN I WAS EIGHT I WANTED TO BE A MARINE BIOLOGIST WHEN I WAS NINE I SAW THE MOVIE JAWS AND THOUGHT TO MYSELF NO THANK YOU
ShaneKoyczan_2013@115.24:116.97 I SAID I 'D LIKE TO BE A WRITER
ShaneKoyczan_2013@117.54:122.73 AND THEY SAID CHOOSE SOMETHING REALISTIC SO I SAID PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER
ShaneKoyczan_2013@123.91:125.72 AND THEY SAID DON 'T BE STUPID
ShaneKoyczan_2013@126.2:145.14 SEE THEY ASKED ME WHAT I WANTED TO BE THEN TOLD ME WHAT NOT TO BE AND I WASN 'T THE ONLY ONE WE WERE BEING TOLD THAT WE SOMEHOW MUST BECOME WHAT WE ARE NOT SACRIFICING WHAT WE ARE TO INHERIT THE MASQUERADE OF WHAT WE WILL BE I WAS BEING TOLD TO ACCEPT THE IDENTITY THAT OTHERS WILL GIVE ME
ShaneKoyczan_2013@145.14:148.37 AND I WONDERED WHAT MADE MY DREAMS SO EASY TO DISMISS
ShaneKoyczan_2013@148.37:152.08 GRANTED MY DREAMS ARE SHY
ShaneKoyczan_2013@152.32:154.95 BECAUSE THEY 'RE CANADIAN

ShaneKoyczan_2013@194.81:200.13 DUKE THE DUMPSTER DROESE STOLE MY ENTIRE SHTICK
ShaneKoyczan_2013@200.91:202.96 I WAS CRUSHED
ShaneKoyczan_2013@203.11:204.98 AS IF BY A TRASH COMPACTOR
ShaneKoyczan_2013@207.48:209.87 I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WHAT NOW WHERE DO I TURN
ShaneKoyczan_2013@217.39:227.37 ONE OF THE FIRST LINES OF POETRY I CAN REMEMBER WRITING WAS IN RESPONSE TO A WORLD THAT DEMANDED I HATE MYSELF FROM AGE FIFTEEN TO EIGHTEEN I HATED MYSELF FOR BECOMING THE THING THAT I LOATHED
ShaneKoyczan_2013@237.9:239.56 STANDING UP FOR YOURSELF
ShaneKoyczan_2013@239.82:243.48 DOESN 'T HAVE TO MEAN EMBRACING VIOLENCE
ShaneKoyczan_2013@243.48:248.12 WHEN I WAS A KID I TRADED IN HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS FOR FRIENDSHIP
ShaneKoyczan_2013@248.12:264.01 THEN GAVE EACH FRIEND A LATE SLIP FOR NEVER SHOWING UP ON TIME AND IN MOST CASES NOT AT ALL I GAVE MYSELF A HALL PASS TO GET THROUGH EACH BROKEN PROMISE AND I REMEMBER THIS PLAN BORN OUT OF FRUSTRATION FROM A KID WHO KEPT CALLING ME YOGI THEN POINTED AT MY TUMMY AND SAID TOO MANY PICNIC BASKETS
ShaneKoyczan_2013@264.17:283.76 TURNS OUT IT 'S NOT THAT HARD TO TRICK SOMEONE AND ONE DAY BEFORE CLASS I SAID YEAH YOU CAN COPY MY HOMEWORK AND I GAVE HIM ALL THE WRONG ANSWERS THAT I 'D WRITTEN DOWN THE NIGHT BEFORE HE GOT HIS PAPER BACK EXPECTING A NEAR PERFECT SCORE AND COULDN 'T BELIEVE IT WHEN HE LOOKED ACROSS THE ROOM AT ME AND HELD UP A ZERO I KNEW I DIDN 'T HAVE TO HOLD UP MY PAPER OF TWENTY EIGHT OUT OF THIRTY
ShaneKoyczan_2013@283.76:290.16 BUT MY SATISFACTION WAS COMPLETE WHEN HE LOOKED AT ME PUZZLED AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE BEAR MOTHERFUCKER
ShaneKoyczan_2013@301.34:303.98 THIS IS HOW I STAND UP FOR MYSELF
ShaneKoyczan_2013@305.1:311.5 WHEN I WAS A KID I USED TO THINK THAT PORK CHOPS AND KARATE CHOPS WERE THE SAME THING
ShaneKoyczan_2013@312.37:327.64 I THOUGHT THEY WERE BOTH PORK CHOPS AND BECAUSE MY GRANDMOTHER THOUGHT IT WAS CUTE AND BECAUSE THEY WERE MY FAVORITE SHE LET ME KEEP DOING IT NOT REALLY A BIG DEAL ONE DAY BEFORE I REALIZED FAT KIDS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO CLIMB TREES I FELL OUT OF A TREE AND BRUISED THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY BODY
ShaneKoyczan_2013@337.31:343.56 FROM THERE I WAS SENT TO ANOTHER SMALL ROOM WITH A REALLY NICE LADY WHO ASKED ME ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT MY LIFE AT HOME
ShaneKoyczan_2013@349.35:352.66 I TOLD HER WHENEVER I 'M SAD MY GRANDMOTHER GIVES ME KARATE CHOPS
ShaneKoyczan_2013@360.73:363.5 THIS LED TO A FULL SCALE INVESTIGATION
ShaneKoyczan_2013@364.46:375.63 AND I WAS REMOVED FROM THE HOUSE FOR THREE DAYS UNTIL THEY FINALLY DECIDED TO ASK HOW I GOT THE BRUISES NEWS OF THIS SILLY LITTLE STORY QUICKLY SPREAD THROUGH THE SCHOOL AND I EARNED MY FIRST NICKNAME

ShaneKoyczan_2013@506.71:511.23 ONE PART BECAUSE OF THE PILLS NINETY NINE PARTS BECAUSE OF THE CRUELTY
ShaneKoyczan_2013@511.58:513.88 HE TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF IN GRADE TEN
ShaneKoyczan_2013@514.09:519.38 WHEN A KID WHO COULD STILL GO HOME TO MOM AND DAD HAD THE AUDACITY TO TELL HIM GET OVER IT
ShaneKoyczan_2013@520.16:525.96 AS IF DEPRESSION IS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE REMEDIED BY ANY OF THE CONTENTS FOUND IN A FIRST AID KIT TO THIS
ShaneKoyczan_2013@545.02:548 WE WEREN 'T THE ONLY KIDS WHO GREW UP THIS WAY
ShaneKoyczan_2013@548.97:552 TO THIS DAY KIDS ARE STILL BEING CALLED NAMES
ShaneKoyczan_2013@552:557.81 THE CLASSICS WERE HEY STUPID
