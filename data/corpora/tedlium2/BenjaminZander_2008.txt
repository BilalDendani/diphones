BenjaminZander_2008@949.78:960.14 BY A PIECE BY CHOPIN NOW THAT IS SOMETHING NOW AM I SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON FOLLOWED THAT UNDERSTOOD IT WAS MOVED BY IT OF COURSE I CAN'T BE SURE BUT I TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED TO ME I WAS IN IRELAND
BenjaminZander_2008@973.30:981.45 AND ONE OF THEM CAME TO ME THE NEXT MORNING AND HE SAID YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER LISTENED TO CLASSICAL MUSIC IN MY LIFE BUT WHEN YOU PLAYED THAT SHOPPING PIECE
BenjaminZander_2008@983.84:992.07 HE SAID MY BROTHER WAS SHOT LAST YEAR AND I DIDN'T CRY FOR HIM BUT LAST NIGHT WHEN YOU PLAYED THAT PIECE HE WAS THE ONE I WAS THINKING ABOUT
BenjaminZander_2008@992.93:1000.02 AND I FELT THE TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND YOU KNOW IT FELT REALLY GOOD TO CRY FOR MY BROTHER SO I MADE UP MY MIND AT THAT MOMENT
BenjaminZander_2008@1000.77:1007.87 CLASSICAL MUSIC IS FOR EVERYBODY EVERYBODY NOW
BenjaminZander_2008@1008.28:1020.03 HOW WOULD YOU WALK BECAUSE YOU KNOW MY PROFESSION THE MUSIC PROFESSION DOESN'T SEE IT THAT WAY THEY SAY THREE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION LIKES CLASSICAL MUSIC IF ONLY WE COULD MOVE IT TO FOUR PERCENT OUR PROBLEMS WOULD BE
BenjaminZander_2008@1032.56:1037.03 IF YOU THOUGHT EVERYBODY LOVES CLASSICAL MUSIC THEY JUST HAVEN'T FOUND OUT ABOUT IT YET
BenjaminZander_2008@1037.85:1038.00 SEE
BenjaminZander_2008@1039.44:1045.90 DIFFERENT WORLDS NOW I HAD AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE I WAS FORTY FIVE YEARS OLD I'D BEEN CONDUCTING FOR TWENTY YEARS
BenjaminZander_2008@1046.17:1055.27 AND I SUDDENLY HAD A REALIZATION THE CONDUCTOR OF AN ORCHESTRA DOESN'T MAKE A SOUND MY PICTURE APPEARS ON THE FRONT OF THE CD
BenjaminZander_2008@1058.16:1069.21 BUT THE CONDUCTOR DOESN'T MAKE A SOUND HE DEPENDS FOR HIS POWER ON HIS ABILITY TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE POWERFUL AND THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING FOR ME IT WAS TOTALLY LIFE CHANGING
BenjaminZander_2008@1079.40:1087.19 I WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER I WAS DOING THAT AND YOU KNOW HOW YOU FIND OUT YOU LOOK AT THEIR EYES IF THEIR EYES ARE SHINING YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING IT
BenjaminZander_2008@1088.19:1096.32 YOU COULD LIGHT UP A VILLAGE WITH THIS GUY 'S EYES RIGHT SO IF THE EYES ARE SHINING YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING IT IF THE EYES ARE NOT SHINING YOU
BenjaminZander_2008@1096.69:1109.84 ASK A QUESTION AND THIS IS THE QUESTION WHO AM I BEING THAT MY PLAYERS EYES ARE NOT SHINING WE CAN DO THAT WITH OUR CHILDREN TOO WHO AM I BEING THAT MY CHILDREN 'S EYES
BenjaminZander_2008@1111.42:1120.48 THAT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT WORLD NOW WE'RE ALL ABOUT TO END THIS MAGICAL ON THE MOUNTAIN WEEK AND WE'RE GOING BACK INTO THE WORLD
BenjaminZander_2008@1121.19:1129.17 AND I SAY IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO ASK THE QUESTION WHO ARE WE BEING AS WE GO BACK OUT INTO THE WORLD
BenjaminZander_2008@1129.82:1144.06 AND YOU KNOW I HAVE A DEFINITION OF SUCCESS FOR ME IT'S VERY SIMPLE IT'S NOT ABOUT WEALTH AND FAME AND POWER IT'S ABOUT HOW MANY SHINING EYES I HAVE AROUND ME SO NOW I HAVE ONE LAST THOUGHT WHICH IS THAT IT REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHAT WE SAY
BenjaminZander_2008@1145.27:1156.80 THE WORDS THAT COME OUT OF OUR MOUTH I LEARNED THIS FROM A WOMAN WHO SURVIVED AUSCHWITZ ONE OF THE RARE SURVIVORS SHE WENT TO AUSCHWITZ WHEN SHE WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD AND
BenjaminZander_2008@1159.41:1164.60 HER BROTHER WAS EIGHT AND THE PARENTS WERE LOST AND
BenjaminZander_2008@1165.81:1173.67 SHE TOLD ME THIS SHE SAID WE WERE IN THE TRAIN GOING TO AUSCHWITZ AND I LOOKED DOWN AND SAW MY BROTHER 'S SHOES WERE MISSING
BenjaminZander_2008@1175.07:1181.77 SO STUPID CAN'T YOU KEEP YOUR THINGS TOGETHER FOR GOODNESS SAKE THE WAY AN ELDER SISTER MIGHT SPEAK TO A YOUNGER BROTHER
BenjaminZander_2008@1197.27:1205.66 AND I MADE A VOW AND THE VOW WAS I WILL NEVER SAY ANYTHING THAT COULDN'T STAND AS THE LAST THING I EVER SAY
BenjaminZander_2008@1206.94:1216.49 NOW CAN WE DO THAT NO AND WE'LL MAKE OURSELVES WRONG AND OTHERS WRONG BUT IT IS A POSSIBILITY TO LIVE INTO THANK YOU
