TorstenReil_2003 TO TALK ABOUT A TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING AT OXFORD NOW THAT WE THINK IS GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT COMPUTER GAMES AND HOLLYWOOD MOVIES ARE BEING MADE
TorstenReil_2003 THAT TECHNOLOGY IS SIMULATING HUMANS IT'S SIMULATED HUMANS WITH A SIMULATED BODY AND A SIMULATED NERVOUS SYSTEM TO CONTROL THAT BODY
TorstenReil_2003 NOW BEFORE I TALK MORE ABOUT THAT TECHNOLOGY LET 'S HAVE A QUICK LOOK AT WHAT HUMAN CHARACTERS LOOK LIKE AT THE MOMENT IN COMPUTER GAMES
TorstenReil_2003 IS ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD GAME IT'S ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL GAMES OF ALL TIME BUT WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS THAT ALL THE ANIMATIONS IN THIS GAME ARE VERY REPETITIVE THEY PRETTY MUCH LOOK THE SAME I'VE MADE HIM RUN INTO A WALL HERE
TorstenReil_2003 IN THE COMPUTER GAME NOW THE RESULT OF THAT IS THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE REAL INTERACTIVITY ALL YOU HAVE IS ANIMATIONS THAT ARE PLAYED BACK AT MORE OR LESS THE APPROPRIATE TIMES IT ALSO MEANS THAT
TorstenReil_2003 THE ONLY WAY TO GET AROUND THAT IS TO ACTUALLY SIMULATE THE HUMAN BODY AND TO SIMULATE THAT BIT OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE BRAIN THAT CONTROLS THAT BODY AND MAYBE IF I COULD HAVE YOU FOR A QUICK DEMONSTRATION TO SHOW WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS
TorstenReil_2003 WE STARTED WORKING ON THIS A WHILE AGO AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY AND WE TRIED TO START VERY SIMPLY WHAT WE TRIED TO DO WAS TEACH A STICK FIGURE HOW TO WALK
TorstenReil_2003 THAT STICK FIGURE IS PHYSICALLY STIMULATED YOU CAN SEE IT HERE ON THE SCREEN SO IT'S SUBJECT TO GRAVITY HAS JOINTS ET CETERA IF YOU RUN THE SIMULATION IT WILL JUST COLLAPSE LIKE THIS
TorstenReil_2003 THE TRICKY BIT IS NOW TO PUT AN AI CONTROLLER IN IT THAT ACTUALLY MAKES IT WORK AND FOR THAT WE USE THE NEURAL NETWORK WHICH WE BASED ON
TorstenReil_2003 THAT PART OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SPINE THAT CONTROLS WALKING IN HUMANS IT'S CALLED THE CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATOR SO WE SIMULATED THAT AS WELL AND THEN THE REALLY TRICKY BIT IS TO TEACH THAT NETWORK HOW TO WALK FOR THAT WE USED ARTIFICIAL EVOLUTION
TorstenReil_2003 A LARGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS NEURAL NETWORKS IN THIS CASE ALL OF WHICH ARE RANDOM AT THE BEGINNING YOU HOOK THESE UP IN THIS CASE TO THE VIRTUAL MUSCLES
TorstenReil_2003 TWO LEGGED CREATURE HERE AND HOPE THAT IT DOES SOMETHING INTERESTING AT THE BEGINNING THEY'RE ALL GOING TO BE VERY BORING MOST OF THEM WON 'T MOVE AT ALL BUT SOME OF THEM MIGHT MAKE A TINY STEP THOSE ARE THEN SELECTED BY THE ALGORITHM
TorstenReil_2003 ONE EVENING IT TOOK ABOUT THREE TO FOUR HOURS TO RUN THE SIMULATION I GOT UP THE NEXT MORNING WENT TO THE COMPUTER AND LOOKED AT THE RESULTS AND WAS HOPING FOR SOMETHING THAT WALKED IN A STRAIGHT LINE LIKE I'VE JUST DEMONSTRATED AND THIS IS WHAT I GOT
TorstenReil_2003 SO IT WAS BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD FOR US
TorstenReil_2003 WALK AT ALL BUT IT WILL GET BETTER AND BETTER OVER TIME SO THIS IS THE ONE THAT
TorstenReil_2003 AFTER FIVE GENERATIONS OF APPLYING EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS THE GENETIC ALGORITHM IS GETTING A TINY BIT BETTER
TorstenReil_2003 THERE
TorstenReil_2003 BUT NOW AFTER GENERATION TWENTY IT ACTUALLY WALKS IN A STRAIGHT LINE WITHOUT
TorstenReil_2003 THAT WAS THE REAL BREAKTHROUGH FOR US
TorstenReil_2003 IT WAS ACADEMICALLY QUITE A CHALLENGING PROJECT AND ONCE WE HAD REACHED THAT STAGE WE WERE QUITE CONFIDENT THAT WE COULD TRY AND DO OTHER THINGS AS WELL
TorstenReil_2003 IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY
TorstenReil_2003 AND AGAIN IF YOU MOVE THE OBSTACLE A TINY BIT IT'LL AGAIN FALL DIFFERENTLY
TorstenReil_2003 SEE BY THE WAY AT THE TOP THERE ARE SOME OF THE NEURAL ACTIVATIONS BEING FED INTO THE VIRTUAL MUSCLES OKAY THAT'S THE VIDEO THANKS NOW THIS MIGHT LOOK KIND OF TRIVIAL BUT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU GET AT THE MOMENT IN ANY INTERACTIVE OR ANY VIRTUAL WORLDS
TorstenReil_2003 NOW AT THIS STAGE WE DECIDED TO START A COMPANY AND MOVE THIS FURTHER BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS WAS JUST A VERY SIMPLE BLOCKY BIPED WHAT WE REALLY WANTED WAS A FULL HUMAN BODY SO WE STARTED THE COMPANY
TorstenReil_2003 TEAM OF PHYSICISTS SOFTWARE ENGINEERS AND BIOLOGISTS TO WORK ON THIS AND THE FIRST THING WE HAD TO WORK ON WAS TO CREATE
TorstenReil_2003 THE HUMAN BODY BASICALLY IT'S GOT TO BE RELATIVELY FAST SO YOU CAN RUN IT ON A NORMAL MACHINE BUT IT'S GOT TO BE ACCURATE ENOUGH SO IT LOOKS GOOD ENOUGH BASICALLY SO WE PUT QUITE A BIT OF BIOMECHANICAL KNOWLEDGE INTO THIS THING
TorstenReil_2003 AND TRIED TO MAKE IT AS REALISTIC AS POSSIBLE WHAT YOU SEE HERE ON THE SCREEN RIGHT NOW IS A VERY SIMPLE VISUALIZATION OF THAT BODY I SHOULD ADD THAT IT'S VERY SIMPLE TO ADD THINGS LIKE
TorstenReil_2003 NOTHING REALLY INTERESTING BASICALLY IT FALLS OVER BUT IT FALLS OVER LIKE A RAG DOLL BASICALLY THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THERE'S NO INTELLIGENCE IN IT IT BECOMES INTERESTING WHEN YOU PUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INTO IT SO THIS CHARACTER NOW HAS
TorstenReil_2003 MOTOR SKILLS IN THE UPPER BODY NOTHING IN THE LEGS YET IN THIS PARTICULAR ONE BUT WHAT IT WILL DO I'M GOING TO PUSH IT AGAIN IT WILL REALIZE AUTONOMOUSLY THAT IT'S BEING PUSHED IT'S GOING TO STICK OUT ITS HANDS IT'S GOING TO TURN AROUND INTO THE FALL AND TRY AND CATCH THE FALL
TorstenReil_2003 YOU SEE HERE NOW IT GETS REALLY INTERESTING IF YOU THEN ADD THE AI FOR THE LOWER PART OF THE BODY AS WELL SO HERE WE'VE GOT THE SAME CHARACTER
TorstenReil_2003 NOW HARDER THAN I JUST PUSHED CHRIS BUT WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS IT'S GOING TO RECEIVE A PUSH NOW FROM THE LEFT
TorstenReil_2003 WHAT YOU SEE IS IT TAKES STEPS BACKWARDS IT TRIES TO COUNTER BALANCE IT TRIES TO LOOK AT THE PLACE WHERE IT THINKS IT'S GOING TO LAND I'LL SHOW YOU THIS AGAIN
TorstenReil_2003 AND THEN FINALLY HITS THE FLOOR NOW
TorstenReil_2003 THIS BECOMES REALLY EXCITING WHEN YOU PUSH THAT CHARACTER IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AGAIN JUST AS I'VE DONE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CANNOT DO RIGHT NOW AT THE MOMENT YOU ONLY HAVE EMPTY COMPUTER GRAPHICS IN GAMES
TorstenReil_2003 THIS IS ALL SLOW MOTION BY THE WAY SO WE CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON NOW THE ANGLE WILL HAVE CHANGED A TINY BIT SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE REACTION IS DIFFERENT
TorstenReil_2003 AGAIN A PUSH NOW THIS TIME FROM THE FRONT AND YOU SEE IT FALLS DIFFERENTLY AND NOW FROM THE LEFT
TorstenReil_2003 JUST A FUN THING WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU PUT THAT CHARACTER THIS IS NOW A WOODEN VERSION OF IT BUT IT'S GOT THE SAME AI IN IT BUT IF YOU PUT THAT CHARACTER ON A SLIPPERY SURFACE LIKE ICE WE JUST DID THAT FOR A LAUGH JUST TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS
TorstenReil_2003 NOW WHEN WE WENT TO FILM STUDIOS AND GAMES DEVELOPERS AND SHOWED THEM THAT TECHNOLOGY WE GOT A VERY GOOD RESPONSE AND WHAT THEY SAID WAS THE FIRST THING THEY NEED IMMEDIATELY
TorstenReil_2003 BECAUSE STUNTS ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY DANGEROUS THEY'RE VERY EXPENSIVE AND THERE ARE A LOT OF STUNT SCENES THAT YOU CANNOT DO OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY ALLOW THE STUNTMAN TO BE SERIOUSLY HURT
TorstenReil_2003 SO THEY WANTED TO HAVE A DIGITAL VERSION OF A STUNTMAN AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND THAT'S OUR FIRST
TorstenReil_2003 GOING TO RELEASE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS SO HERE ARE JUST A FEW VERY SIMPLE SCENES OF THE GUY JUST BEING KICKED THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT THAT'S
TorstenReil_2003 NOW HERE 'S ANOTHER ONE WHAT PEOPLE WANTED AS A BEHAVIOR WAS TO HAVE AN EXPLOSION A STRONG FORCE APPLIED TO THE CHARACTER AND HAVE THE CHARACTER REACT TO IT
TorstenReil_2003 IN MID AIR SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A CHARACTER THAT LOOKS LIMP BUT ACTUALLY A CHARACTER THAT YOU CAN USE IN AN ACTION FILM STRAIGHT AWAY THAT LOOKS KIND OF ALIVE IN MID AIR AS WELL SO THIS CHARACTER IS GOING TO BE HIT BY A FORCE
TorstenReil_2003 THIS IS SOMETHING I JUST GOT LAST NIGHT FROM AN ANIMATION STUDIO IN LONDON WHO ARE USING OUR SOFTWARE AND EXPERIMENTING WITH IT RIGHT NOW SO THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME BEHAVIOR THAT YOU SAW BUT IN A SLIGHTLY
TorstenReil_2003 AGAIN A SLOW MOTION VERSION OF THIS
TorstenReil_2003 THIS IS INCREDIBLY QUICK THIS IS HAPPENING IN REAL TIME YOU CAN RUN THIS SIMULATION IN REAL TIME IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES CHANGE IT IF YOU WANT TO AND YOU GET THE ANIMATION STRAIGHT OUT OF IT AT THE MOMENT DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS BY HAND WOULD TAKE YOU PROBABLY A COUPLE OF DAYS
TorstenReil_2003 AND IT LOOKS ORGANIC IT LOOKS REALISTIC YOU FEEL KIND OF SORRY FOR THE GUY IT'S EVEN WORSE AND THAT IS ANOTHER VIDEO I JUST GOT LAST NIGHT IF YOU RENDER THAT A BIT MORE REALISTICALLY
TorstenReil_2003 NOW
TorstenReil_2003 ONE THING WHICH WE DID FOR A LAUGH WAS TO CREATE A SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLEX STUNT SCENE AND ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS STUNTS IS THE ONE WHERE JAMES BOND JUMPS OFF A DAM IN SWITZERLAND AND THEN IS CAUGHT BY A BUNGEE GOT A VERY SHORT CLIP HERE
TorstenReil_2003 JUST ABOUT SEE IT HERE IN THIS CASE THEY WERE USING A REAL STUNT MAN IT WAS A VERY DANGEROUS STUNT IT WAS JUST VOTED I THINK IN THE SUNDAY TIMES AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE STUNTS
TorstenReil_2003 CAUGHT BY A BUNGEE AFTERWARDS WE DID THAT IT TOOK ABOUT TWO HOURS PRETTY MUCH TO CREATE THE SIMULATION AND THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE HERE
TorstenReil_2003 NOW THIS COULD DO WITH A BIT MORE WORK IT'S STILL VERY EARLY STAGES AND WE PRETTY MUCH JUST DID THIS FOR A LAUGH JUST TO SEE WHAT WE'D GET OUT OF IT BUT WHAT WE FOUND OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS IS THAT THIS APPROACH
TorstenReil_2003 IS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL WE ARE OURSELVES SURPRISED WHAT YOU ACTUALLY GET OUT OF THE SIMULATIONS THERE'S VERY OFTEN VERY SURPRISING BEHAVIOR THAT YOU DIDN'T PREDICT BEFORE
TorstenReil_2003 SO MANY THINGS WE CAN DO WITH THIS RIGHT NOW THE FIRST THING AS I SAID IS GOING TO BE VIRTUAL STUNT MEN SEVERAL STUDIOS ARE USING THIS SOFTWARE NOW TO PRODUCE VIRTUAL STUNT MEN AND THEY'RE GOING TO HIT THE SCREEN QUITE SOON ACTUALLY FOR SOME MAJOR PRODUCTIONS
TorstenReil_2003 THE SECOND THING IS VIDEO GAMES WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY VIDEO GAMES WILL LOOK DIFFERENT AND THEY WILL FEEL VERY DIFFERENT
TorstenReil_2003 FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU'LL HAVE ACTORS THAT REALLY FEEL VERY INTERACTIVE THAT HAVE REAL BODIES THAT REALLY REACT I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY EXCITING PROBABLY STARTING WITH SPORTS GAMES WHICH ARE GOING TO BECOME MUCH MORE INTERACTIVE
TorstenReil_2003 BUT I PARTICULARLY AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT USING THIS TECHNOLOGY IN ONLINE WORLDS LIKE THERE FOR EXAMPLE THAT TOM MELCHER HAS SHOWN US THE DEGREE OF INTERACTIVITY YOU'RE GOING TO GET IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT I THINK FROM WHAT YOU'RE GETTING RIGHT NOW
TorstenReil_2003 IS TO USE OUR TECHNOLOGY AND IN PARTICULAR THE WALKING TECHNOLOGY TO HELP AID SURGEONS WHO WORK ON CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY
TorstenReil_2003 TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF OPERATIONS ON THESE CHILDREN AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHAT THE OUTCOME OF AN OPERATION IS IF YOU TRY AND CORRECT THE
TorstenReil_2003 THE GAIT OF A PARTICULAR CHILD AND THE SURGEON CAN THEN WORK ON THAT SIMULATION AND TRY OUT DIFFERENT WAYS TO IMPROVE THAT GAIT BEFORE HE ACTUALLY COMMITS TO AN ACTUAL SURGERY
TorstenReil_2003 JUST FINALLY THIS IS ONLY JUST THE BEGINNING WE CAN ONLY DO SEVERAL BEHAVIORS RIGHT NOW THE AI ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO SIMULATE A FULL HUMAN BODY
TorstenReil_2003 THE BODY YES BUT NOT ALL THE MOTOR SKILLS THAT WE HAVE AND I THINK WE'RE ONLY THERE IF WE CAN HAVE SOMETHING LIKE BALLET DANCING RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT BUT I'M VERY SURE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT AT SOME STAGE
TorstenReil_2003 WE DO HAVE ONE UNINTENTIONAL DANCER ACTUALLY THE LAST THING I WANTED TO SHOW YOU THIS WAS AN AI CONTOUR THAT WAS PRODUCED AND EVOLVED HALF EVOLVED I SHOULD SAY
TorstenReil_2003 TO PRODUCE BALANCE BASICALLY SO YOU KICK THE GUY AND THE GUY 'S SUPPOSED TO COUNTER BALANCE THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS BUT THIS IS WHAT EMERGED OUT OF IT IN THE END
TorstenReil_2003 NOT QUITE SURE WHY SO THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING WE ACTUALLY PUT
TorstenReil_2003 THAT DANCE HIMSELF HE 'S ACTUALLY A BETTER DANCER THAN I AM I HAVE TO SAY AND WHAT YOU SEE AFTER A WHILE I THINK HE EVEN GOES INTO A CLIMAX RIGHT AT THE END AND
