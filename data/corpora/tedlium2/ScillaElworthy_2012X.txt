ScillaElworthy_2012X HALF A CENTURY OF TRYING TO HELP PREVENT WARS THERE 'S ONE QUESTION THAT NEVER LEAVES ME HOW DO WE DEAL WITH EXTREME VIOLENCE WITHOUT USING FORCE IN RETURN
ScillaElworthy_2012X FIGHT BACK
ScillaElworthy_2012X THIS QUESTION HOW DO I DEAL WITH A BULLY WITHOUT BECOMING A THUG IN RETURN
ScillaElworthy_2012X HAS BEEN WITH ME EVER SINCE I WAS A CHILD I REMEMBER I WAS ABOUT THIRTEEN GLUED TO A GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE TELEVISION IN MY PARENTS LIVING ROOM AS SOVIET TANKS ROLLED INTO BUDAPEST
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND KIDS NOT MUCH OLDER THAN ME WERE THROWING THEMSELVES AT THE TANKS AND GETTING MOWN DOWN
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND I RUSHED UPSTAIRS AND STARTED PACKING MY SUITCASE AND MY MOTHER CAME UP AND SAID WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING AND I SAID I 'M GOING TO BUDAPEST
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND SHE SAID WHAT ON EARTH FOR AND I SAID KIDS ARE GETTING KILLED THERE THERE 'S SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENING AND SHE SAID DON 'T BE SO SILLY AND I STARTED TO CRY
ScillaElworthy_2012X BULLIES USE VIOLENCE IN THREE WAYS THEY USE POLITICAL VIOLENCE TO INTIMIDATE
ScillaElworthy_2012X PHYSICAL VIOLENCE TO TERRORIZE
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND MENTAL OR EMOTIONAL VIOLENCE TO UNDERMINE
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND ONLY VERY RARELY IN VERY FEW CASES DOES IT WORK TO USE MORE VIOLENCE NELSON MANDELA
ScillaElworthy_2012X WENT TO JAIL BELIEVING IN VIOLENCE
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND TWENTY SEVEN YEARS LATER HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES HAD SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY HONED THE SKILLS THE INCREDIBLE SKILLS THAT THEY NEEDED TO TURN ONE OF THE MOST VICIOUS GOVERNMENTS THE WORLD HAS KNOWN INTO A DEMOCRACY
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND THEY DID IT IN A TOTAL DEVOTION TO NON VIOLENCE
ScillaElworthy_2012X THEY REALIZED THAT USING FORCE AGAINST FORCE DOESN 'T WORK SO WHAT
ScillaElworthy_2012X IT 'S MY RESPONSE MY ATTITUDE TO OPPRESSION
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND MEDITATION OR SELF INSPECTION IS ONE OF THE WAYS AGAIN IT 'S NOT THE ONLY ONE IT 'S ONE OF THE WAYS OF GAINING THIS KIND OF INNER POWER
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND MY HEROINE HERE LIKE SATISH 'S IS AUNG SAN SUU KYI IN BURMA
ScillaElworthy_2012X SHE WAS LEADING A GROUP OF STUDENTS ON A PROTEST IN THE STREETS OF RANGOON THEY CAME AROUND A CORNER FACED WITH A ROW OF MACHINE GUNS AND SHE REALIZED STRAIGHT AWAY THAT THE SOLDIERS WITH THEIR FINGERS SHAKING ON THE TRIGGERS WERE MORE SCARED THAN THE STUDENT PROTESTERS BEHIND HER
ScillaElworthy_2012X BUT SHE TOLD THE STUDENTS TO SIT DOWN AND SHE WALKED FORWARD WITH SUCH CALM AND SUCH CLARITY
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND SUCH TOTAL LACK OF FEAR THAT SHE COULD WALK RIGHT UP TO THE FIRST GUN PUT HER HAND ON IT
ScillaElworthy_2012X SO WHAT ABOUT OUR FEAR I HAVE A LITTLE MANTRA
ScillaElworthy_2012X MY FEAR GROWS FAT ON THE ENERGY I FEED IT
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND IF IT GROWS VERY BIG IT PROBABLY HAPPENS SO WE ALL KNOW THE
ScillaElworthy_2012X PARALYZED WITH FEAR AT COMING TO TALK TO YOU
ScillaElworthy_2012X BUT ANGER AS AN ENGINE IN AN ENGINE IS POWERFUL IF WE CAN PUT OUR ANGER INSIDE AN ENGINE IT CAN DRIVE US FORWARD IT CAN GET US THROUGH THE DREADFUL MOMENTS AND IT CAN GIVE US REAL INNER POWER AND I LEARNED THIS
ScillaElworthy_2012X IN MY WORK WITH NUCLEAR WEAPON POLICY MAKERS BECAUSE AT THE BEGINNING I WAS SO OUTRAGED AT THE DANGERS THEY WERE EXPOSING US TO THAT I JUST WANTED TO ARGUE AND BLAME AND MAKE THEM WRONG
ScillaElworthy_2012X TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND THEY 'RE DOING WHAT THEY THINK IS BEST AND THAT 'S THE BASIS ON WHICH WE HAVE TO TALK WITH THEM SO THAT 'S THE THIRD ONE ANGER AND IT BRINGS ME TO THE CRUX OF WHAT 'S GOING ON OR WHAT I PERCEIVE AS GOING ON IN THE WORLD TODAY WHICH IS THAT
ScillaElworthy_2012X IT 'S PEOPLE JOINING UP WITH PEOPLE AS BUNDY JUST SAID MILES AWAY TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE AND PEACE DIRECT SPOTTED QUITE EARLY ON THAT LOCAL PEOPLE IN AREAS OF VERY HOT CONFLICT
ScillaElworthy_2012X KNOW WHAT TO DO THEY KNOW BEST WHAT TO DO SO PEACE DIRECT GETS BEHIND THEM TO DO THAT
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND THE KIND OF THING THEY 'RE DOING IS DEMOBILIZING MILITIAS REBUILDING ECONOMIES RESETTLING REFUGEES
ScillaElworthy_2012X EVEN LIBERATING CHILD SOLDIERS AND THEY HAVE TO RISK THEIR LIVES ALMOST EVERY DAY TO DO THIS
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND I THINK THAT THE U S MILITARY IS FINALLY BEGINNING TO GET THIS UP TO NOW THEIR COUNTER TERRORISM POLICY
ScillaElworthy_2012X HAS BEEN TO KILL INSURGENTS AT ALMOST ANY COST AND IF CIVILIANS GET IN THE WAY THAT 'S WRITTEN AS COLLATERAL DAMAGE
ScillaElworthy_2012X SO THE TRAINING OF THE TROOPS HAS TO CHANGE AND I THINK THERE ARE SIGNS THAT IT IS BEGINNING TO CHANGE THE BRITISH MILITARY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MUCH BETTER AT THIS
ScillaElworthy_2012X IN IRAQ ACTUALLY
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND SUDDENLY PEOPLE WERE POURING OUT OF THE HOUSES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD SCREAMING
ScillaElworthy_2012X YELLING FURIOUSLY ANGRY AND SURROUNDED THESE VERY YOUNG TROOPS WHO WERE COMPLETELY TERRIFIED DIDN 'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON COULDN 'T SPEAK ARABIC
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND CHRIS HUGHES STRODE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE THRONG WITH HIS WEAPON ABOVE HIS HEAD POINTING AT THE GROUND AND HE SAID KNEEL
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND THESE HUGE SOLDIERS WITH THEIR
ScillaElworthy_2012X THAT TO ME IS WISDOM IN ACTION IN THE MOMENT THAT 'S WHAT HE DID
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND IT 'S HAPPENING EVERYWHERE NOW YOU DON 'T BELIEVE ME HAVE YOU ASKED YOURSELVES WHY AND HOW
ScillaElworthy_2012X SO MANY DICTATORSHIPS HAVE COLLAPSED OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS
ScillaElworthy_2012X DICTATORSHIPS
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND EGYPT AND THIS HASN 'T JUST HAPPENED
ScillaElworthy_2012X A LOT OF IT IS DUE TO A BOOK WRITTEN BY AN EIGHTY YEAR OLD MAN IN BOSTON GENE SHARP HE WROTE A BOOK CALLED FROM DICTATORSHIP TO DEMOCRACY WITH EIGHTY ONE METHODOLOGIES FOR NON VIOLENT RESISTANCE
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND IT 'S BEEN TRANSLATED INTO TWENTY SIX LANGUAGES IT 'S FLOWN AROUND THE WORLD
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND IT 'S BEING USED BY YOUNG
ScillaElworthy_2012X PEOPLE AND OLDER PEOPLE EVERYWHERE BECAUSE IT WORKS
ScillaElworthy_2012X WE 'RE GETTING PRACTICAL DOABLE METHODOLOGIES TO ANSWER MY QUESTION HOW DO WE DEAL WITH A BULLY WITHOUT BECOMING
ScillaElworthy_2012X INNER POWER THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNER POWER THROUGH SELF KNOWLEDGE RECOGNIZING AND WORKING WITH OUR FEAR USING ANGER AS A FUEL COOPERATING WITH OTHERS BANDING TOGETHER WITH OTHERS COURAGE
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND MOST IMPORTANTLY COMMITMENT TO ACTIVE NON VIOLENCE
ScillaElworthy_2012X WE CAN BRING TO AN END THE BLOODIEST CENTURY THAT HUMANITY HAS EVER KNOWN
ScillaElworthy_2012X AND WE CAN ORGANIZE TO OVERCOME OPPRESSION
ScillaElworthy_2012X BY OPENING OUR HEARTS AS WELL AS STRENGTHENING THIS INCREDIBLE
