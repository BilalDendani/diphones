RichardBranson_2007@571.50:576.01 BACK INTO THIS GIANT EYE BUT HE 'S ABSOLUTELY GENIUS WHEN IT COMES
RichardBranson_2007@577.72:579.40 BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE HIM DESIGN THE ENGINE
RichardBranson_2007@581.09:583.22 IS QUITE ERRATIC SO I THINK THAT HE WOULDN'T BE THE BEST
RichardBranson_2007@584.27:585.49 TO DESIGN
RichardBranson_2007@586.35:587.48 A WONDERFUL TALK HERE
RichardBranson_2007@609.43:616.51 MANY TIMES I MEAN I THINK WITH THE BALLOONING AND BOATING EXPEDITIONS WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST
RichardBranson_2007@618.05:629.58 THE SEA I THINK SIX TIMES BY HELICOPTERS SO AND EACH TIME I DIDN'T EXPECT TO COME HOME TO TELL THE TALE SO IN THOSE MOMENTS YOU CERTAINLY WONDER WHAT YOU'RE DOING UP THERE OR
RichardBranson_2007@630.73:634.20 YOU GOT TO WHEN DID YOU THINK THIS IS IT I MIGHT BE
RichardBranson_2007@641.91:650.97 EACH ONE ACTUALLY I THINK WE CAME CLOSE AND I MEAN FIRST OF ALL WE NOBODY HAD ACTUALLY CROSSED THE ATLANTIC IN A HOT AIR BALLOON BEFORE SO WE HAD TO
RichardBranson_2007@653.57:663.07 BUILD A HOT AIR BALLOON THAT WAS CAPABLE OF FLYING IN THE JET STREAM AND WE WEREN'T QUITE SURE WHEN A BALLOON ACTUALLY GOT INTO THE JET STREAM WHETHER IT WOULD ACTUALLY SURVIVE
RichardBranson_2007@664.53:670.66 TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES AN HOUR WINDS THAT YOU CAN FIND UP THERE AND SO JUST THE INITIAL
RichardBranson_2007@671.17:678.80 LIFT OFF FROM SUGARLOAF TO CROSS THE ATLANTIC AS WERE PUSHING INTO THE JET STREAM THIS ENORMOUS BALLOON THE TOP OF THE BALLOON
RichardBranson_2007@687.11:694.12 AND IT JUST TOOK OFF AND IT WAS LIKE HOLDING ONTO A THOUSAND HORSES AND WE WERE JUST
RichardBranson_2007@694.63:698.59 CROSSING EVERY FINGER PRAYING THAT THE BALLOON WOULD HOLD TOGETHER WHICH
RichardBranson_2007@701.75:704.25 THE ENDS OF ALL THOSE BALLOON TRIPS WERE
RichardBranson_2007@714.96:717.55 AND LEFT ME HOLDING ON
RichardBranson_2007@726.14:730.06 ME JUMP BUT ONCE HIS WEIGHT HAD GONE THE BALLOON JUST SHOT UP TO
RichardBranson_2007@732.59:736.48 TWELVE THOUSAND FEET AND I CA AND YOU INSPIRED AN
RichardBranson_2007@739.16:743.75 I PUT ON MY OXYGEN MASK AND STOOD ON TOP OF THE BALLOON WITH MY PARACHUTE LOOKING AT THE
RichardBranson_2007@746.08:753.43 MY COURAGE TO JUMP INTO THE NORTH SEA WHICH AND IT WAS A VERY VERY VERY LONELY FEW MOMENTS BUT ANYWAY WE
RichardBranson_2007@758.70:761.16 I KNEW I HAD ABOUT HALF AN HOUR 'S FUEL LEFT
RichardBranson_2007@762.16:763.36 AND I ALSO KNEW THAT
RichardBranson_2007@763.82:771.22 THE CHANCES WERE THAT IF I JUMPED I WOULD ONLY HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF LIFE LEFT SO I CLIMBED BACK INTO THE CAPSULE AND
RichardBranson_2007@773.48:782.74 MAKE SURE THAT I WAS MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION AND WROTE SOME NOTES TO MY FAMILY AND THEN CLIMBED BACK UP AGAIN LOOKED DOWN AT THOSE CLOUDS AGAIN CLIMBED BACK INTO THE CAPSULE AGAIN
RichardBranson_2007@783.88:791.31 AND THEN FINALLY JUST THOUGHT THERE'S A BETTER WAY I'VE GOT YOU KNOW THIS ENORMOUS BALLOON ABOVE ME IT'S THE BIGGEST PARACHUTE
RichardBranson_2007@792.87:799.56 WHY NOT USE IT AND SO I MANAGED TO FLY THE BALLOON DOWN THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND ABOUT
RichardBranson_2007@800.45:813.41 FIFTY FEET BEFORE I HIT THE SEA THREW MYSELF OVER AND THE BALLOON HIT THE SEA AND WENT SHOOTING BACK UP TEN THOUSAND FEET WITHOUT ME BUT IT WAS A WONDERFUL FEELING BEING IN THAT WATER AND CA WHAT DID YOU WRITE TO
RichardBranson_2007@815.71:822.38 JUST WHAT YOU WOULD DO IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT JUST I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH AND
RichardBranson_2007@823.62:832.49 I'D ALREADY WRITTEN THEM A LETTER BEFORE GOING ON THIS TRIP WHICH JUST IN CASE ANYTHING HAD HAPPENED BUT FORTUNATELY THEY NEVER HAD TO USE IT
RichardBranson_2007@833.94:837.40 YOUR COMPANIES HAVE HAD INCREDIBLE PR VALUE OUT
RichardBranson_2007@845.85:854.72 REGARDED AS THIS GREAT HERO IN THE U K AND ELSEWHERE AND CYNICS MIGHT SAY YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST A SMART BUSINESS GUY DOING WHAT IT TAKES TO
RichardBranson_2007@859.06:860.92 HOW MUCH WAS THE PR
RichardBranson_2007@869.75:878.82 AS AN AIRLINE OWNER THE LAST THING YOU SHOULD BE DOING IS HEADING OFF IN BALLOONS AND BOATS AND CRASHING INTO THE
RichardBranson_2007@883.16:883.78 THEY HAD A POINT
RichardBranson_2007@897.43:899.75 YOU MUST HAVE BEEN A GENIUS FROM THE GET GO RIGHT

RichardBranson_2007@916.22:920.54 I HAD NO UNDERSTANDING OF SCHOOLWORK WHATSOEVER
RichardBranson_2007@923.66:926.43 I CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE FAILED IQ TESTS
RichardBranson_2007@927.45:933.13 AND IT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS I LEFT SCHOOL WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD AND
RichardBranson_2007@934.84:937.41 IF I IF I'M NOT INTERESTED IN SOMETHING
RichardBranson_2007@940.77:945.50 I DON'T GRASP IT AS SOMEBODY WHO 'S DYSLEXIC YOU ALSO HAVE SOME QUITE BIZARRE SITUATIONS
RichardBranson_2007@948.70:959.05 I'VE HAD TO YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN RUNNING THE LARGEST GROUP OF PRIVATE COMPANIES IN EUROPE BUT HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NET AND GROSS AND SO THE BOARD MEETINGS HAVE BEEN
RichardBranson_2007@961.74:972.31 AND SO IT'S LIKE GOOD NEWS OR BAD NEWS AND GENERALLY THE PEOPLE WOULD SAY OH WELL THAT'S BAD NEWS CA BUT JUST TO CLARIFY THE TWENTY FIVE BILLION IS GROSS RIGHT THAT'S GROSS RB WELL I
RichardBranson_2007@985.82:987.79 SO WHEN I TURNED FIFTY SOMEBODY TOOK ME OUTSIDE THE
RichardBranson_2007@991.52:997.47 DRAW ON A DIAGRAM HERE 'S A NET IN THE SEA AND THE FISH HAVE BEEN PULLED FROM THE SEA INTO THIS NET

RichardBranson_2007@1040.46:1047.92 SOME BIZARRE THINGS HAPPENED JUST EARLIER IN YOUR LIFE I MEAN THERE'S THE STORY ABOUT YOUR MOTHER ALLEGEDLY DUMPING YOU IN A FIELD AGED FOUR AND SAYING OK
RichardBranson_2007@1050.52:1059.13 WAS YOU KNOW SHE FELT THAT WE NEEDED TO STAND ON OUR OWN TWO FEET FROM AN EARLY AGE SO SHE DID THINGS TO US WHICH NOW SHE'D BE ARRESTED FOR
RichardBranson_2007@1060.50:1067.83 SUCH AS PUSHING US OUT OF THE CAR AND TELLING US TO FIND OUR OWN WAY TO GRANNY 'S ABOUT FIVE MILES BEFORE WE ACTUALLY GOT THERE
RichardBranson_2007@1068.86:1074.67 AND MAKING US GO ON WONDERFUL LONG BIKE RIDES AND WE WERE NEVER ALLOWED TO WATCH TELEVISION
RichardBranson_2007@1085.73:1089.01 TOO CODDLED THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'VE GOT WE'RE GOING TO RAISE A GENERATION OF
RichardBranson_2007@1089.54:1103.95 I THINK IF YOU'RE BRINGING UP KIDS YOU JUST WANT TO SMOTHER THEM WITH LOVE AND PRAISE AND ENTHUSIASM SO I DON'T THINK YOU CAN MOLLYCODDLE YOUR KIDS TOO MUCH
RichardBranson_2007@1105.33:1106.85 YOU DIDN'T TURN OUT TOO BAD I HAVE TO SAY
RichardBranson_2007@1108.65:1119.03 YOUR HEADMASTER SAID TO YOU I MEAN HE FOUND YOU KIND OF AN ENIGMA AT YOUR SCHOOL HE SAID YOU'RE EITHER GOING TO BE A MILLIONAIRE OR GO TO PRISON AND I'M NOT SURE WHICH WHICH OF THOSE
RichardBranson_2007@1123.70:1130.21 BOTH I THINK I WENT TO PRISON FIRST I WAS ACTUALLY PROSECUTED UNDER TWO QUITE ANCIENT ACTS IN THE
RichardBranson_2007@1141.16:1148.84 MENTIONING THE WORD VENEREAL DISEASE IN PUBLIC WHICH WE HAD A CENTER WHERE WE WOULD HELP YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAD PROBLEMS AND ONE OF THE
RichardBranson_2007@1171.20:1177.73 AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS HERE 'S THE SEX PISTOLS THE WORD BOLLOCKS THE POLICE DECIDED
RichardBranson_2007@1178.20:1185.34 WAS A RUDE WORD AND SO WE WERE ARRESTED FOR USING THE WORD BOLLOCKS ON THE SEX PISTOLS ALBUM AND
RichardBranson_2007@1186.13:1188.58 JOHN MORTIMER THE PLAYWRIGHT DEFENDED US
RichardBranson_2007@1189.29:1194.08 AND HE ASKED IF I COULD FIND A LINGUISTICS EXPERT TO
RichardBranson_2007@1194.98:1201.80 COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF THE WORD BOLLOCKS AND SO I RANG UP NOTTINGHAM UNIVERSITY AND I ASKED TO TALK TO THE PROFESSOR OF LINGUISTICS
RichardBranson_2007@1202.97:1209.96 AND HE SAID LOOK BOLLOCKS IS NOT A HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BALLS WHATSOEVER IT'S ACTUALLY A NICKNAME GIVEN TO PRIESTS IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
RichardBranson_2007@1216.06:1225.22 A PRIEST MYSELF AND SO I SAID WOULD YOU MIND COMING TO THE COURT AND HE SAID HE'D BE DELIGHTED AND I SAID AND HE SAID WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO WEAR MY DOG COLLAR AND I SAID YES THAT
RichardBranson_2007@1228.66:1237.22 SO OUR KEY WITNESS WAS ARGUED THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY NEVER MIND THE PRIEST HERE 'S THE SEX PISTOLS AND THE JUDGE FOUND US RELUCTANTLY FOUND US NOT
RichardBranson_2007@1239.81:1240.68 THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS
RichardBranson_2007@1264.18:1266.98 IS ANY OF IT TRUE IS THERE AN ELEMENT OF TRUTH IN IT
RichardBranson_2007@1267.77:1272.08 I DON'T ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE STEREOTYPE OF A BUSINESS PERSON
RichardBranson_2007@1281.59:1290.11 COME BACK AND COME BACK FOR MORE AND I THINK ALL YOU HAVE IN LIFE IS YOUR REPUTATION AND IT'S A VERY SMALL WORLD
RichardBranson_2007@1291.29:1298.94 AND I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE BEST WAY OF BECOMING A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS LEADER IS
RichardBranson_2007@1309.98:1317.84 THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU AND WHO SEE YOU SPENDING YOU KEEP GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THESE NEW PROJECTS BUT IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE YOU'RE ADDICTED TO LAUNCHING NEW STUFF YOU GET EXCITED BY
RichardBranson_2007@1318.58:1325.43 AND KAPOW I MEAN DO YOU THINK ABOUT LIFE BALANCE HOW DO YOUR FAMILY FEEL ABOUT EACH TIME YOU STEP INTO SOMETHING BIG AND
RichardBranson_2007@1336.71:1348.91 AND SO WE SPEND A VERY GOOD SORT OF THREE MONTHS AWAY TOGETHER YES I 'LL YOU KNOW BE IN TOUCH WE'RE VERY LUCKY WE HAVE THIS TINY LITTLE ISLAND IN THE CARIBBEAN
RichardBranson_2007@1360.57:1365.95 YOU STARTED TALKING IN RECENT YEARS ABOUT THIS TERM CAPITALIST PHILANTHROPY WHAT IS THAT
RichardBranson_2007@1369.79:1372.65 WORKS YOU KNOW THE ALTERNATIVE COMMUNISM
RichardBranson_2007@1373.95:1374.81 HAS NOT
RichardBranson_2007@1376.30:1377.87 THE PROBLEM WITH CAPITALISM IS
RichardBranson_2007@1385.74:1387.07 WITH THAT WEALTH AND
RichardBranson_2007@1388.01:1390.14 I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE INDIVIDUALS
RichardBranson_2007@1391.08:1397.59 IN THAT FORTUNATE POSITION DO NOT END UP COMPETING FOR BIGGER AND BIGGER BOATS AND BIGGER AND BIGGER CARS
RichardBranson_2007@1399.14:1405.32 YOU KNOW USE THAT MONEY TO EITHER CREATE NEW JOBS OR TO TACKLE
RichardBranson_2007@1406.30:1411.51 AROUND THE WORLD CA AND WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THAT YOU WORRY ABOUT MOST CARE MOST ABOUT WANT TO TURN YOUR
RichardBranson_2007@1414.26:1423.38 WELL THERE'S I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES I MEAN GLOBAL WARMING CERTAINLY IS A MASSIVE THREAT TO MANKIND
RichardBranson_2007@1424.57:1431.89 AND WE ARE PUTTING A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY INTO A TRYING TO COME UP WITH ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND
RichardBranson_2007@1435.07:1446.79 WE JUST LAUNCHED THIS PRIZE WHICH IS REALLY A PRIZE IN CASE WE DON'T GET AN ANSWER ON ALTERNATIVE FUELS IN CASE WE DON'T ACTUALLY MANAGE TO GET THE CARBON
RichardBranson_2007@1452.27:1464.28 WE NEED TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO COME UP WITH A WAY OF EXTRACTING CARBON OUT OF THE EARTH 'S ATMOSPHERE AND WE JUST YOU KNOW THERE WEREN'T REALLY PEOPLE WORKING ON THAT BEFORE SO WE WANTED PEOPLE TO TRY TO
RichardBranson_2007@1465.20:1472.85 THE BEST BRAINS IN THE WORLD TO START THINKING ABOUT THAT AND ALSO TO TRY TO EXTRACT THE METHANE OUT OF THE EARTH 'S ATMOSPHERE AS WELL
RichardBranson_2007@1487.69:1496.52 YES I MEAN WE'VE GOT WE'RE SETTING UP SOMETHING CALLED THE WAR ROOM WHICH IS MAYBE THE WRONG WORD WE'RE TRYING TO MAYBE WE'LL CHANGE IT BUT ANYWAY IT'S A WAR ROOM TO
RichardBranson_2007@1497.01:1498.44 TRY TO COORDINATE ALL
RichardBranson_2007@1500.10:1506.09 GOING ON IN AFRICA ALL THE DIFFERENT SOCIAL PROBLEMS IN AFRICA AND TRY TO LOOK AT BEST
RichardBranson_2007@1507.84:1519.35 PRACTICES SO FOR INSTANCE THERE'S A DOCTOR IN AFRICA THAT'S FOUND THAT IF YOU GIVE A MOTHER ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUGS AT TWENTY FOUR WEEKS
RichardBranson_2007@1534.36:1538.01 THE WAR ROOM SOUNDS IT SOUNDS POWERFUL AND DRAMATIC AND IS THERE A RISK
RichardBranson_2007@1539.01:1542.54 THE KIND OF THE BUSINESS HEROES OF THE WEST
RichardBranson_2007@1543.19:1554.06 GET SO EXCITED ABOUT I MEAN THEY'RE USED TO HAVING AN IDEA GETTING STUFF DONE AND THEY BELIEVE PROFOUNDLY IN THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD IS THERE A RISK THAT WE GO TO PLACES LIKE AFRICA AND SAY
RichardBranson_2007@1555.78:1562.15 THIS PROBLEM AND WE CAN DO IT I'VE GOT ALL THESE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS YOU KNOW DA DA DA HERE 'S THE BIG IDEA AND KIND OF
RichardBranson_2007@1566.09:1567.86 MAKING A MESS OF IT DO YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT
RichardBranson_2007@1570.05:1571.08 ON THIS PARTICULAR
RichardBranson_2007@1574.23:1587.21 SITUATION WE'RE ACTUALLY WE'RE WORKING WITH THE GOVERNMENT ON IT I MEAN THABO MBEKI 'S HAD HIS PROBLEMS WITH ACCEPTING HIV AND AIDS ARE RELATED BUT THIS IS A WAY I THINK OF HIM
RichardBranson_2007@1588.49:1589.50 TACKLING THIS PROBLEM
RichardBranson_2007@1590.47:1598.49 AND INSTEAD OF THE WORLD CRITICIZING HIM IT'S A WAY OF WORKING WITH HIM WITH HIS GOVERNMENT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IF PEOPLE DO GO TO AFRICA AND DO TRY TO HELP
RichardBranson_2007@1598.80:1607.58 THEY DON'T JUST GO IN THERE AND THEN LEAVE AFTER A FEW YEARS IT'S GOT TO BE CONSISTENT BUT I THINK BUSINESS LEADERS CAN BRING THEIR ENTREPRENEURIAL
RichardBranson_2007@1615.05:1623.39 CLINICS IN AFRICA WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE GIVING FREE ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUGS FREE TB TREATMENT AND FREE MALARIA TREATMENT BUT
RichardBranson_2007@1623.97:1630.38 WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO MAKE THEM SELF SUSTAINING CLINICS SO THAT PEOPLE PAY FOR SOME OTHER ASPECTS CA I MEAN
RichardBranson_2007@1630.76:1636.31 A LOT OF CYNICS SAY ABOUT SOMEONE LIKE YOURSELF OR BILL GATES OR WHATEVER THAT THIS IS REALLY BEING
RichardBranson_2007@1646.51:1655.90 I THINK THAT EVERYBODY PEOPLE DO THINGS FOR A WHOLE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT REASONS AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WHEN I'M ON ME DEATHBED I WILL WANT TO FEEL THAT
RichardBranson_2007@1656.86:1662.66 I'VE MADE A DIFFERENCE TO OTHER PEOPLE 'S LIVES AND THAT MAY BE A SELFISH THING TO THINK
RichardBranson_2007@1663.29:1671.15 THE WAY I'VE BEEN BROUGHT UP I THINK IF I'M IN A POSITION TO RADICALLY CHANGE OTHER PEOPLE 'S LIVES FOR THE BETTER I SHOULD DO SO CA HOW
RichardBranson_2007@1672.40:1676.12 I'M FIFTY SIX CA I MEAN THE PSYCHOLOGIST ERIK ERIKSON SAYS THAT
RichardBranson_2007@1676.69:1679.82 AS I UNDERSTAND HIM AND I'M A TOTAL AMATEUR BUT THAT
RichardBranson_2007@1682.59:1687.99 PEOPLE ARE DRIVEN BY THIS DESIRE TO GROW AND THAT'S WHERE THEY GET THEIR FULFILLMENT
RichardBranson_2007@1689.32:1695.89 SIXTIES THE MODE OF OPERATION SHIFTS MORE TO THE QUEST FOR WISDOM AND A SEARCH FOR LEGACY
RichardBranson_2007@1709.04:1717.50 I DON'T THINK I THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT LEGACY I MEAN I LIKE TO YOU KNOW MY GRANDMOTHER LIVED TO ONE HUNDRED AND ONE
RichardBranson_2007@1722.04:1730.09 I JUST WANT TO LIVE LIFE TO ITS FULL YOU KNOW IF I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO
RichardBranson_2007@1730.52:1737.82 MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND I THINK ONE OF THE POSITIVE THINGS AT THE MOMENT IS YOU'VE GOT SERGEY AND LARRY FROM GOOGLE FOR INSTANCE
