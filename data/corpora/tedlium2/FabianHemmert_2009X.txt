FabianHemmert_2009X PH D STUDENT
FabianHemmert_2009X AND THAT MEANS I HAVE A QUESTION HOW CAN WE MAKE DIGITAL CONTENT GRASPABLE BECAUSE YOU SEE
FabianHemmert_2009X ON THE ONE HAND THERE IS THE DIGITAL WORLD AND NO QUESTION MANY THINGS ARE HAPPENING THERE RIGHT NOW
FabianHemmert_2009X SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET THE STUFF OVER FROM THE DIGITAL INTO THE PHYSICAL THAT'S MY QUESTION IF YOU LOOK AT THE IPHONE WITH ITS TOUCH AND THE WII WITH ITS BODILY ACTIVITY YOU CAN SEE THE TENDENCY IT'S GETTING PHYSICAL
FabianHemmert_2009X THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S NEXT NOW I HAVE THREE OPTIONS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU THE FIRST ONE IS MASS AS HUMANS WE ARE SENSITIVE TO WHERE AN OBJECT IN OUR HAND IS HEAVY SO COULD WE USE THAT
FabianHemmert_2009X LET ME SHOW YOU THE WEIGHT SHIFTING MOBILE IT IS A MOBILE PHONE SHAPED BOX THAT HAS AN IRON WEIGHT INSIDE WHICH WE CAN MOVE AND YOU CAN FEEL WHERE IT'S HEAVY WE SHIFT THE GRAVITATIONAL CENTER OF IT
FabianHemmert_2009X FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN AUGMENT DIGITAL CONTENT WITH PHYSICAL MASS SO YOU MOVE AROUND THE CONTENT ON A DISPLAY BUT YOU CAN ALSO FEEL WHERE IT IS JUST FROM THE WEIGHT OF THE DEVICE
FabianHemmert_2009X ANOTHER THING IT'S GOOD
FabianHemmert_2009X AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT THAT IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DEVICE ALL THE TIME YOU HAVE YOUR EYES FREE TO SEE THE CITY NOW MASS IS THE FIRST THING THE SECOND THING
FabianHemmert_2009X THAT'S SHAPE WE'RE ALSO SENSITIVE TO THE SHAPE OF OBJECTS WE HAVE IN HANDS SO IF I DOWNLOAD AN E BOOK AND IT HAS TWENTY PAGES WELL THEY COULD BE THIN RIGHT BUT IF IT HAS FIVE HUNDRED PAGES I WANT TO FEEL THAT HARRY POTTER IT'S THICK
FabianHemmert_2009X SO LET ME SHOW YOU THE SHAPE CHANGING MOBILE AGAIN IT'S A MOBILE PHONE SHAPED BOX AND THIS ONE CAN CHANGE ITS SHAPE
FabianHemmert_2009X ALSO USEFUL IF YOU WANT TO PUT IT DOWN ON YOUR NIGHTSTAND TO WATCH A MOVIE OR USE AS AN ALARM CLOCK IT STANDS IT'S FAIRLY SIMPLE
FabianHemmert_2009X ANOTHER THING IS SOMETIMES WE WATCH THINGS ON A MOBILE PHONE THEY ARE BIGGER THAN THE PHONE ITSELF SO IN THAT CASE LIKE HERE THERE'S AN APP THAT'S BIGGER THAN THE PHONE 'S SCREEN
FabianHemmert_2009X SHAPE IS THE SECOND THING THE THIRD THING OPERATES ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL AS HUMANS WE
FabianHemmert_2009X I CAN FEEL IT IT'S DOING ALL RIGHT I DON'T HAVE TO CHECK IT LET ME SHOW YOU THE LIVING MOBILE PHONE SO ONCE AGAIN MOBILE PHONE SHAPED BOX BUT THIS ONE
FabianHemmert_2009X AND A HEARTBEAT AND IT FEELS VERY ORGANIC
FabianHemmert_2009X AND YOU CAN TELL IT'S RELAXED RIGHT NOW OH NOW MISSED CALL A NEW CALL NEW GIRLFRIEND MAYBE VERY EXCITING
FabianHemmert_2009X HOW DO WE CALM IT DOWN YOU GIVE IT A PAT BEHIND THE EARS AND EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT AGAIN SO
FabianHemmert_2009X VERY INTUITIVE AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT SO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN ARE THREE WAYS TO MAKE THE DIGITAL GRASPABLE FOR US AND I THINK MAKING IT PHYSICAL IS A GOOD WAY TO DO THAT
FabianHemmert_2009X WHAT'S BEHIND THAT IS A POSTULATION NAMELY THAT HUMANS SHOULD GET MUCH MORE TECHNICAL IN THE FUTURE RATHER THAN THAT TECHNOLOGY A BIT MORE HUMAN
