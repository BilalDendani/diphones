AmyTan_2008 VALUE OF NOTHING
AmyTan_2008 OUT OF NOTHING COMES SOMETHING
AmyTan_2008 THAT WAS AN ESSAY I WROTE WHEN I WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD AND I GOT A B PLUS
AmyTan_2008 THAT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT CREATES A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE BUT NEAR DEATH IS GOOD FOR CREATIVITY
AmyTan_2008 IF I SAID ANYTHING THAT WAS A LIE OR NOT TRUE TO UNIVERSAL CREATIVITY AND I 'VE DONE IT THIS WAY FOR HALF THE AUDIENCE WHO IS SCIENTIFIC WHEN I SAY WE I DON 'T MEAN YOU NECESSARILY I MEAN ME AND MY RIGHT BRAIN MY LEFT BRAIN AND THE ONE THAT 'S IN BETWEEN THAT IS THE CENSOR AND TELLS ME WHAT I 'M SAYING IS WRONG
AmyTan_2008 AND I 'M GOING DO THAT ALSO BY LOOKING AT
AmyTan_2008 WHAT I THINK IS PART OF MY CREATIVE PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED ACTUALLY THE NOTHING STARTED EVEN EARLIER THAN THE MOMENT IN WHICH I 'M CREATING SOMETHING NEW AND THAT INCLUDES NATURE
AmyTan_2008 AND NURTURE AND WHAT I REFER TO AS NIGHTMARES
AmyTan_2008 AND SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT WE 'RE BORN WITH IT IN SOME OTHER MEANS AND OTHERS LIKE MY MOTHER WOULD SAY THAT I GET MY MATERIAL FROM PAST LIVES
AmyTan_2008 PEOPLE WOULD ALSO SAY THAT CREATIVITY MAY BE A FUNCTION OF SOME OTHER NEUROLOGICAL QUIRK VAN GOGH SYNDROME THAT YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF YOU KNOW PSYCHOSIS
AmyTan_2008 OR DEPRESSION I DO HAVE TO SAY SOMEBODY I READ RECENTLY THAT VAN GOGH WASN 'T REALLY NECESSARILY PSYCHOTIC THAT HE MIGHT HAVE HAD TEMPORAL LOBE SEIZURES
AmyTan_2008 AND THAT MIGHT HAVE CAUSED HIS SPURT OF CREATIVITY AND I DON 'T I SUPPOSE IT DOES SOMETHING IN SOME PART OF YOUR BRAIN AND I WILL MENTION THAT I ACTUALLY DEVELOPED TEMPORAL LOBE SEIZURES
AmyTan_2008 A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO BUT IT WAS DURING THE TIME I WAS WRITING MY LAST BOOK AND SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT BOOK IS QUITE DIFFERENT
AmyTan_2008 AND THEN I ALSO WASN 'T REALLY SHINING IN A CERTAIN AREA THAT I WANTED TO BE AND YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT THOSE SCORES AND IT WASN 'T BAD BUT IT WAS NOT CERTAINLY PREDICTIVE THAT I WOULD ONE DAY MAKE MY LIVING OUT OF THE ARTFUL ARRANGEMENT OF WORDS
AmyTan_2008 ALSO ONE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF
AmyTan_2008 CREATIVITY IS TO HAVE A LITTLE CHILDHOOD TRAUMA
AmyTan_2008 BUT ACTUALLY THERE WAS SOMETHING QUITE REAL IN MY LIFE THAT HAPPENED WHEN I WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT MY BROTHER IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN AND THEN MY FATHER SIX MONTHS LATER HAD BRAIN TUMORS AND MY MOTHER BELIEVED THAT
AmyTan_2008 SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG AND SHE WAS GONNA FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS AND SHE WAS GONNA FIX IT
AmyTan_2008 MY FATHER WAS A BAPTIST MINISTER AND HE BELIEVED IN MIRACLES AND THAT GOD 'S WILL WOULD TAKE CARE OF THAT BUT OF COURSE THEY ENDED UP DYING SIX MONTHS APART
AmyTan_2008 AND AFTER THAT MY MOTHER BELIEVED THAT IT WAS FATE OR CURSES SHE WENT LOOKING THROUGH ALL THE REASONS IN THE UNIVERSE WHY THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED EVERYTHING EXCEPT RANDOMNESS SHE DID NOT BELIEVE IN RANDOMNESS THERE WAS A REASON FOR EVERYTHING
AmyTan_2008 AND ONE OF THE REASONS SHE THOUGHT WAS THAT HER MOTHER WHO HAD DIED WHEN SHE WAS VERY YOUNG
AmyTan_2008 WAS ANGRY AT HER AND SO I HAD THIS NOTION OF DEATH ALL AROUND ME BECAUSE
AmyTan_2008 MY MOTHER ALSO BELIEVED THAT I WOULD BE NEXT AND SHE WOULD BE NEXT AND WHEN YOU ARE FACED WITH THE PROSPECT OF DEATH VERY SOON YOU BEGIN TO THINK VERY MUCH ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU BECOME VERY CREATIVE IN A SURVIVAL SENSE
AmyTan_2008 AND THIS THEN LED TO MY BIG QUESTIONS AND THEY 'RE THE SAME ONES THAT I HAVE TODAY
AmyTan_2008 AND THEY ARE WHY DO THINGS HAPPEN AND HOW DO THINGS HAPPEN AND THE ONE MY MOTHER ASKED HOW DO I MAKE THINGS HAPPEN
AmyTan_2008 IT 'S A WONDERFUL WAY TO LOOK AT THESE QUESTIONS WHEN YOU WRITE A STORY BECAUSE AFTER ALL IN THAT FRAMEWORK BETWEEN PAGE ONE AND THREE HUNDRED YOU HAVE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION
AmyTan_2008 TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT YEARS AND YEARS OFTENTIMES
AmyTan_2008 SO WHEN I LOOK AT CREATIVITY I ALSO THINK THAT IT IS THIS SENSE OR THIS INABILITY TO
AmyTan_2008 AND SO I 'M GOING TO USE AS THE METAPHOR THIS ASSOCIATION QUANTUM MECHANICS WHICH I REALLY DON 'T UNDERSTAND BUT I 'M STILL GONNA USE IT AS THE PROCESS FOR EXPLAINING HOW IT IS
AmyTan_2008 THE METAPHOR SO
AmyTan_2008 IN QUANTUM MECHANICS OF COURSE YOU HAVE DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER
AmyTan_2008 AND YOU OFTEN DON 'T KNOW WHAT IT IS EXCEPT BY ITS ABSENCE BUT WHEN YOU MAKE THOSE ASSOCIATIONS YOU WANT THEM TO COME TOGETHER IN A KIND OF SYNERGY IN THE STORY AND WHAT YOU 'RE FINDING IS WHAT MATTERS THE MEANING AND THAT 'S WHAT I LOOK FOR IN MY WORK A PERSONAL MEANING
AmyTan_2008 AND THERE 'S THE TERRIBLE AND DREADED OBSERVER EFFECT IN WHICH YOU 'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING AND YOU KNOW THINGS ARE HAPPENING SIMULTANEOUSLY AND YOU 'RE LOOKING AT IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND YOU 'RE TRYING TO REALLY
AmyTan_2008 SERENDIPITOUS WAY IS NO LONGER THERE
AmyTan_2008 NOW I DON 'T WANT TO IGNORE
AmyTan_2008 THE OTHER SIDE OF WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR UNIVERSE LIKE MANY OF OUR SCIENTISTS HAVE AND SO I AM GOING TO JUST THROW IN STRING THEORY HERE AND JUST SAY THAT CREATIVE PEOPLE ARE MULTIDIMENSIONAL AND THERE ARE ELEVEN LEVELS I THINK
AmyTan_2008 THERE IS ALSO A BIG QUESTION OF AMBIGUITY AND I WOULD LINK THAT TO SOMETHING CALLED THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT AND YOU DON 'T KNOW WHAT IS OPERATING BUT SOMETHING IS OPERATING THERE AND AMBIGUITY TO ME IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN MY LIFE
AmyTan_2008 AND I HAVE IT MORAL AMBIGUITY IT IS CONSTANTLY THERE AND JUST AS AN EXAMPLE THIS IS ONE THAT RECENTLY CAME TO ME IT WAS SOMETHING I READ IN AN EDITORIAL BY A WOMAN WHO WAS TALKING ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQ
AmyTan_2008 SO THEIR WAY OF RATIONALIZING THAT IS THEY ARE SAVING THE FISH FROM DROWNING AND UNFORTUNATELY IN THE PROCESS THE FISH DIE NOW WHAT
AmyTan_2008 THESE DROWNING METAPHORS ACTUALLY
AmyTan_2008 TO ME THEY HAD TO DO WITH INTENTIONS AND ALL OF US IN LIFE WHEN WE SEE A SITUATION
AmyTan_2008 WE HAVE A RESPONSE AND THEN WE HAVE INTENTIONS THERE 'S AN AMBIGUITY OF WHAT THAT SHOULD BE THAT WE SHOULD DO AND THEN WE DO SOMETHING AND THE RESULTS OF THAT MAY NOT MATCH WHAT OUR INTENTIONS HAD BEEN MAYBE THINGS GO WRONG
AmyTan_2008 AND SO AFTER THAT WHAT ARE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO DO WE STAY IN FOR LIFE OR DO WE DO SOMETHING ELSE AND JUSTIFY AND SAY WELL MY INTENTIONS WERE GOOD
AmyTan_2008 AND THEREFORE I CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF IT THAT IS THE AMBIGUITY IN MY LIFE
AmyTan_2008 THAT REALLY DISTURBED ME AND LED ME TO WRITE A BOOK CALLED SAVING FISH FROM DROWNING
AmyTan_2008 AND WHAT I NEED IN EFFECT IS A FOCUS AND WHEN I HAVE THE QUESTION IT IS A FOCUS AND ALL THESE THINGS THAT SEEM TO BE FLOTSAM AND JETSAM IN LIFE ACTUALLY GO THROUGH THAT QUESTION
AmyTan_2008 AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THOSE PARTICULAR THINGS BECOME RELEVANT AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT 'S HAPPENING ALL THE TIME YOU THINK THERE 'S A SORT OF COINCIDENCE GOING ON A SERENDIPITY IN WHICH YOU 'RE GETTING ALL THIS HELP FROM THE UNIVERSE AND IT MAY ALSO BE EXPLAINED THAT NOW YOU HAVE A FOCUS AND YOU ARE NOTICING IT MORE OFTEN
AmyTan_2008 BUT
AmyTan_2008 YOU APPLY THIS YOU BEGIN TO LOOK AT THINGS HAVING TO DO WITH YOUR TENSIONS YOUR BROTHER WHO 'S FALLEN IN TROUBLE DO YOU TAKE CARE OF HIM WHY OR WHY NOT IT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT IS
AmyTan_2008 PERHAPS MORE SERIOUS AS I SAID HUMAN RIGHTS
AmyTan_2008 BURMA I WAS THINKING THAT I SHOULDN 'T GO BECAUSE SOMEBODY SAID IF I DID IT WOULD SHOW THAT I APPROVED OF THE MILITARY REGIME THERE AND THEN AFTER A WHILE I HAD TO ASK MYSELF WHY DO WE TAKE ON KNOWLEDGE WHY DO WE TAKE ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN US
AmyTan_2008 AND IT WAS THE SAME THING THAT I FELT WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AND WAS HEARING THESE RULES OF MORAL CONDUCT FROM MY FATHER WHO WAS A BAPTIST MINISTER
AmyTan_2008 SO I DECIDED THAT I WOULD GO TO BURMA FOR MY OWN INTENTIONS AND STILL DIDN 'T KNOW THAT IF I WENT THERE WHAT THE RESULT OF THAT WOULD BE IF I WROTE A BOOK
AmyTan_2008 AND I JUST WOULD HAVE TO FACE THAT LATER WHEN THE TIME CAME
AmyTan_2008 WE ARE ALL CONCERNED WITH THINGS THAT WE SEE IN THE WORLD THAT WE ARE AWARE OF WE COME TO THIS POINT AND SAY WHAT DO I AS AN INDIVIDUAL DO NOT ALL OF US CAN GO TO AFRICA OR WORK AT HOSPITALS SO WHAT DO WE DO IF WE HAVE
AmyTan_2008 THIS MORAL RESPONSE THIS FEELING ALSO I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS WE ARE ALL LOOKING AT AND WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY IS GENOCIDE
AmyTan_2008 THIS LEADS TO THIS QUESTION WHEN I LOOK AT ALL THESE THINGS THAT ARE
AmyTan_2008 MORALLY AMBIGUOUS AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND I CONSIDER WHAT MY INTENTIONS SHOULD BE I REALIZE IT GOES BACK TO THIS IDENTITY QUESTION THAT I HAD WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND WHY AM I HERE AND WHAT IS THE MEANING OF MY LIFE AND WHAT IS MY PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE IT SEEMS SO
AmyTan_2008 SOMETIMES I GET HELP FROM THE UNIVERSE IT SEEMS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY IT WAS THE GHOST OF MY GRANDMOTHER FROM THE VERY FIRST BOOK BECAUSE IT SEEMED I KNEW THINGS I WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW
AmyTan_2008 INSTEAD OF WRITING THAT THE GRANDMOTHER DIED ACCIDENTALLY FROM AN OVERDOSE OF OPIUM WHILE HAVING TOO MUCH OF A GOOD TIME I ACTUALLY PUT DOWN IN THE STORY THAT THE WOMAN KILLED HERSELF AND THAT ACTUALLY WAS THE WAY IT HAPPENED AND MY MOTHER DECIDED
AmyTan_2008 THAT THAT INFORMATION MUST HAVE COME
AmyTan_2008 FROM MY GRANDMOTHER THERE ARE ALSO THINGS
AmyTan_2008 QUITE UNCANNY WHICH BRING ME INFORMATION THAT WILL HELP ME IN THE WRITING OF THE BOOK IN THIS CASE I WAS WRITING A STORY THAT INCLUDED SOME KIND OF DETAIL PERIOD OF HISTORY A CERTAIN LOCATION AND I NEEDED TO FIND SOMETHING HISTORICALLY THAT WOULD MATCH THAT
AmyTan_2008 AND I TOOK DOWN THIS BOOK AND I FIRST PAGE THAT I FLIPPED IT TO WAS EXACTLY THE SETTING AND THE TIME PERIOD AND THE KIND OF CHARACTER I NEEDED WAS THE TAIPING REBELLION HAPPENING IN THE AREA NEAR GUILIN OUTSIDE OF THAT AND A CHARACTER WHO THOUGHT HE WAS THE SON OF GOD
AmyTan_2008 YOU WONDER ARE THESE THINGS RANDOM CHANCE WELL WHAT IS RANDOM WHAT IS CHANCE WHAT IS LUCK WHAT ARE THINGS THAT YOU GET FROM THE UNIVERSE THAT YOU CAN 'T REALLY EXPLAIN AND THAT GOES INTO THE STORY TOO THESE ARE THE THINGS I CONSTANTLY THINK ABOUT FROM DAY TO DAY ESPECIALLY WHEN GOOD THINGS HAPPEN
AmyTan_2008 AND IN PARTICULAR WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN
AmyTan_2008 BUT I DO THINK THERE 'S A KIND OF
AmyTan_2008 A DISCOMFORT I FELT AND THEN I KNEW THAT HAD TO BE THE SETTING OF MY BOOK
AmyTan_2008 I CAME ACROSS THIS AND IT WAS A MAN A CHINESE MAN AND HE WAS STACKING THESE THINGS NOT WITH GLUE NOT WITH ANYTHING AND I ASKED HIM HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO DO THIS AND HE SAID
AmyTan_2008 WELL I GUESS WITH EVERYTHING IN LIFE THERE 'S A PLACE OF BALANCE
AmyTan_2008 AND THIS WAS EXACTLY THE MEANING OF MY STORY AT THAT POINT
AmyTan_2008 I HAD SO MANY EXAMPLES I HAVE SO MANY INSTANCES LIKE THIS WHEN I 'M WRITING A STORY AND I CANNOT EXPLAIN IT IS IT BECAUSE I HAD THE FILTER
AmyTan_2008 THAT I HAVE SUCH A STRONG COINCIDENCE IN WRITING ABOUT THESE THINGS OR IS IT A KIND OF SERENDIPITY THAT WE CANNOT EXPLAIN LIKE THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT
AmyTan_2008 A BIG THING THAT I ALSO THINK ABOUT IS ACCIDENTS AND AS I SAID MY MOTHER DID NOT BELIEVE IN RANDOMNESS WHAT IS THE NATURE OF ACCIDENTS AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO ASSIGN WHAT THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE CAUSES ARE OUTSIDE OF A COURT OF LAW
AmyTan_2008 WAY WHEN I WENT TO BEAUTIFUL DONG VILLAGE IN GUIZHOU THE POOREST PROVINCE OF CHINA AND I SAW THIS BEAUTIFUL PLACE I KNEW I WANTED TO COME BACK AND I HAD A CHANCE TO DO THAT WHEN NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO WRITE ANYTHING ABOUT CHINA
AmyTan_2008 THERE WAS A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT A MAN AN OLD MAN FELL ASLEEP AND HIS QUILT DROPPED IN A PAN OF FIRE THAT KEPT HIM WARM SIXTY HOMES WERE DESTROYED AND FORTY WERE DAMAGED RESPONSIBILITY WAS ASSIGNED TO THE FAMILY THE MAN 'S SONS WERE BANISHED TO LIVE
AmyTan_2008 THREE KILOMETERS AWAY IN A COWSHED AND OF COURSE AS WESTERNERS WE SAY WELL IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THAT 'S NOT FAIR IT 'S THE SON NOT THE FATHER
AmyTan_2008 AND I BEGAN TO SENSE SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THE HISTORY AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED BEFORE AND THE NATURE OF LIFE IN A VERY POOR VILLAGE AND WHAT YOU FIND AS YOUR JOYS AND YOUR RITUALS YOUR TRADITIONS YOUR LINKS WITH OTHER FAMILIES AND I SAW HOW THIS
AmyTan_2008 YOU BEGIN TO WONDER WHOSE BELIEFS ARE THOSE THAT ARE IN OPERATION IN THE WORLD DETERMINING HOW THINGS HAPPEN
AmyTan_2008 SO I REMAINED WITH THEM AND THE MORE I WROTE THAT STORY THE MORE I GOT INTO THOSE BELIEFS AND I THINK THAT 'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO TAKE ON THE BELIEFS BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE STORY IS REAL AND THAT IS WHERE I 'M GONNA FIND THE ANSWERS TO HOW I FEEL ABOUT CERTAIN QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE IN LIFE
AmyTan_2008 YEARS GO BY OF COURSE AND THE WRITING IT DOESN 'T HAPPEN INSTANTLY AS I 'M TRYING TO CONVEY IT TO YOU HERE AT TED THE BOOK COMES AND IT GOES WHEN IT ARRIVES IT IS NO LONGER MY BOOK IT IS IN THE HANDS OF READERS AND THEY INTERPRET IT DIFFERENTLY
AmyTan_2008 AND I THINK IT IS BY QUESTIONING AND SAYING TO MYSELF THAT THERE ARE NO
AmyTan_2008 TRUTHS I BELIEVE IN SPECIFICS THE SPECIFICS OF STORY AND THE PAST THE SPECIFICS OF THAT PAST AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE STORY AT THAT POINT
AmyTan_2008 I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IN THINKING ABOUT THINGS MY THINKING ABOUT LUCK AND FATE AND COINCIDENCES AND ACCIDENTS GOD 'S WILL AND THE SYNCHRONY OF MYSTERIOUS FORCES I WILL COME TO SOME NOTION OF WHAT THAT IS HOW WE CREATE
AmyTan_2008 I HAVE TO THINK OF MY ROLE WHERE I AM IN THE UNIVERSE AND DID SOMEBODY INTEND FOR ME TO BE THAT WAY OR IS IT JUST SOMETHING I CAME UP WITH AND
AmyTan_2008 I ALSO CAN FIND THAT BY IMAGINING FULLY AND BECOMING WHAT IS IMAGINED AND YET IS IN THAT REAL WORLD THE FICTIONAL WORLD AND THAT IS HOW I FIND PARTICLES OF TRUTH NOT THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH OR THE WHOLE TRUTH
AmyTan_2008 AND THEY HAVE TO BE IN ALL POSSIBILITIES INCLUDING THOSE I NEVER CONSIDERED BEFORE
AmyTan_2008 SO THERE ARE NEVER COMPLETE ANSWERS
AmyTan_2008 OR RATHER IF THERE IS AN ANSWER IT IS TO REMIND MYSELF THAT THERE IS UNCERTAINTY IN EVERYTHING AND THAT IS GOOD
AmyTan_2008 BECAUSE THEN I WILL DISCOVER SOMETHING NEW
AmyTan_2008 AND IF THERE IS A PARTIAL ANSWER A MORE COMPLETE ANSWER FROM ME IT IS TO SIMPLY IMAGINE AND TO IMAGINE IS TO PUT MYSELF IN THAT STORY UNTIL THERE WAS ONLY THERE IS A TRANSPARENCY BETWEEN ME AND THE STORY THAT I AM CREATING
AmyTan_2008 AND THAT 'S HOW I 'VE DISCOVERED THAT IF I FEEL WHAT IS IN THE STORY
AmyTan_2008 IN ONE STORY THEN
AmyTan_2008 I COME THE CLOSEST I THINK TO KNOWING WHAT COMPASSION IS TO FEELING THAT COMPASSION BECAUSE FOR EVERYTHING IN THAT QUESTION OF HOW THINGS HAPPEN IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FEELING I HAVE TO BECOME THE STORY IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND A LOT OF THAT
