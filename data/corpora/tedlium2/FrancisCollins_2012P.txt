FrancisCollins_2012P@23.01:25.13 WELL THERE DO SEEM TO BE A FEW
FrancisCollins_2012P@25.19:27.03 WELL CONGRATULATIONS
FrancisCollins_2012P@27.29:40.52 BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR SLIDE OF U S LIFE EXPECTANCY YOU ARE NOW IN EXCESS OF THE AVERAGE LIFE SPAN OF SOMEBODY WHO WAS BORN IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED BUT LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN THE COURSE OF THAT CENTURY
FrancisCollins_2012P@40.71:44.82 IF YOU FOLLOW THAT CURVE YOU 'LL SEE THAT IT STARTS WAY DOWN THERE
FrancisCollins_2012P@58.02:67.98 SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU ASK HOW MANY DISEASES DO WE NOW KNOW THE EXACT MOLECULAR BASIS TURNS OUT IT 'S ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND WHICH IS PRETTY AMAZING
FrancisCollins_2012P@68.14:72.22 BECAUSE MOST OF THOSE MOLECULAR DISCOVERIES HAVE JUST HAPPENED IN THE LAST LITTLE WHILE
FrancisCollins_2012P@72.98:80.4 IT 'S EXCITING TO SEE THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE 'VE LEARNED BUT HOW MANY OF THOSE FOUR THOUSAND DISEASES NOW HAVE TREATMENTS AVAILABLE
FrancisCollins_2012P@80.65:85.52 ONLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SO WE HAVE THIS HUGE CHALLENGE THIS HUGE GAP
FrancisCollins_2012P@85.52:97.41 YOU WOULD THINK THIS WOULDN 'T BE TOO HARD THAT WE WOULD SIMPLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE THIS FUNDAMENTAL INFORMATION THAT WE 'RE LEARNING ABOUT HOW IT IS THAT BASIC BIOLOGY TEACHES US ABOUT THE CAUSES OF DISEASE
FrancisCollins_2012P@97.41:107.82 AND BUILD A BRIDGE ACROSS THIS YAWNING GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE 'VE LEARNED ABOUT BASIC SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATION A BRIDGE THAT WOULD LOOK MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
FrancisCollins_2012P@116.77:133.16 UNFORTUNATELY IT 'S NOT IN REALITY TRYING TO GO FROM FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE TO ITS APPLICATION IS MORE LIKE THIS THERE ARE NO SHINY BRIDGES YOU SORT OF PLACE YOUR BETS MAYBE YOU 'VE GOT A SWIMMER AND A ROWBOAT AND A SAILBOAT AND A TUGBOAT AND YOU SET THEM OFF ON THEIR WAY
FrancisCollins_2012P@133.16:143.09 AND THE RAINS COME AND THE LIGHTNING FLASHES AND OH MY GOSH THERE ARE SHARKS IN THE WATER AND THE SWIMMER GETS INTO TROUBLE AND UH OH THE SWIMMER DROWNED AND THE SAILBOAT CAPSIZED
FrancisCollins_2012P@143.77:148.41 AND THAT TUGBOAT WELL IT HIT THE ROCKS AND MAYBE IF YOU 'RE LUCKY SOMEBODY GETS ACROSS
FrancisCollins_2012P@150.44:153.32 WELL WHAT IS IT TO MAKE A THERAPEUTIC ANYWAY WHAT 'S A DRUG
FrancisCollins_2012P@153.41:161.91 A DRUG IS MADE UP OF A SMALL MOLECULE OF HYDROGEN CARBON OXYGEN NITROGEN AND A FEW OTHER ATOMS ALL COBBLED TOGETHER IN A SHAPE
FrancisCollins_2012P@161.91:180.8 AND IT 'S THOSE SHAPES THAT DETERMINE WHETHER IN FACT THAT PARTICULAR DRUG IS GOING TO HIT ITS TARGET IS IT GOING TO LAND WHERE IT 'S SUPPOSED TO SO LOOK AT THIS PICTURE HERE A LOT OF SHAPES DANCING AROUND FOR YOU NOW WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IF YOU 'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP A NEW TREATMENT FOR AUTISM OR ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE OR CANCER IS TO FIND THE RIGHT SHAPE IN THAT
FrancisCollins_2012P@180.8:183.79 MIX THAT WILL ULTIMATELY PROVIDE BENEFIT AND WILL BE SAFE
FrancisCollins_2012P@183.89:200.11 AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT PIPELINE YOU START OUT MAYBE WITH THOUSANDS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF COMPOUNDS YOU WEED DOWN THROUGH VARIOUS STEPS THAT CAUSE MANY OF THESE TO FAIL ULTIMATELY MAYBE YOU CAN RUN A CLINICAL TRIAL WITH FOUR OR FIVE OF THESE AND IF ALL GOES WELL FOURTEEN YEARS AFTER YOU STARTED
FrancisCollins_2012P@200.11:201.67 YOU WILL GET ONE APPROVAL
FrancisCollins_2012P@202.22:205.89 AND IT WILL COST YOU UPWARDS OF A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT ONE SUCCESS
FrancisCollins_2012P@206.25:217.39 SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS PIPELINE THE WAY AN ENGINEER WOULD AND SAY HOW CAN WE DO BETTER AND THAT 'S THE MAIN THEME OF WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO YOU THIS MORNING HOW CAN WE MAKE THIS GO FASTER HOW CAN WE MAKE IT MORE SUCCESSFUL
FrancisCollins_2012P@218.14:221.7 WELL LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A FEW EXAMPLES WHERE THIS HAS ACTUALLY WORKED
FrancisCollins_2012P@221.99:230.39 ONE THAT HAS JUST HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS IS THE SUCCESSFUL APPROVAL OF A DRUG FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS BUT IT 'S TAKEN A LONG TIME TO GET THERE
FrancisCollins_2012P@230.48:234.92 CYSTIC FIBROSIS HAD ITS MOLECULAR CAUSE DISCOVERED IN ONE THOUSAND NINE
FrancisCollins_2012P@241.15:246.72 THAT PICTURE YOU SEE THERE HERE IT IS THAT 'S THE SAME KID THAT 'S DANNY BESSETTE
FrancisCollins_2012P@246.77:259.17 TWENTY THREE YEARS LATER BECAUSE THIS IS THE YEAR AND IT 'S ALSO THE YEAR WHERE DANNY GOT MARRIED WHERE WE HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE APPROVAL BY THE FDA OF A DRUG THAT PRECISELY TARGETS THE DEFECT IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS
FrancisCollins_2012P@259.17:273.48 BASED UPON ALL THIS MOLECULAR UNDERSTANDING THAT 'S THE GOOD NEWS THE BAD NEWS IS THIS DRUG DOESN 'T ACTUALLY TREAT ALL CASES OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND IT WON 'T WORK FOR DANNY AND WE 'RE STILL WAITING FOR THAT NEXT GENERATION TO HELP HIM BUT IT TOOK TWENTY THREE YEARS TO GET THIS FAR THAT 'S TOO LONG
FrancisCollins_2012P@293.34:309.69 THAT ARE OUR INSTRUCTION BOOK AND THE INSTRUCTION BOOK FOR ALL LIVING THINGS AND THE COST OF DOING THIS WHICH USED TO BE IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAS IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST TEN YEARS FALLEN FASTER THAN MOORE 'S LAW DOWN TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TODAY TO HAVE YOUR GENOME SEQUENCED OR MINE
FrancisCollins_2012P@309.69:312.56 AND WE 'RE HEADED FOR THE DOLLAR ONE THOUSAND GENOME FAIRLY SOON
FrancisCollins_2012P@312.67:328.81 WELL THAT 'S EXCITING HOW DOES THAT PLAY OUT IN TERMS OF APPLICATION TO A DISEASE I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT ANOTHER DISORDER THIS ONE IS A DISORDER WHICH IS QUITE RARE IT 'S CALLED HUTCHINSON GILFORD PROGERIA AND IT IS THE MOST DRAMATIC FORM OF PREMATURE AGING
FrancisCollins_2012P@328.98:345.81 ONLY ABOUT ONE IN EVERY FOUR MILLION KIDS HAS THIS DISEASE AND IN A SIMPLE WAY WHAT HAPPENS IS BECAUSE OF A MUTATION IN A PARTICULAR GENE A PROTEIN IS MADE THAT 'S TOXIC TO THE CELL AND IT CAUSES THESE INDIVIDUALS TO AGE AT ABOUT SEVEN TIMES THE NORMAL RATE
FrancisCollins_2012P@346.27:359.57 LET ME SHOW YOU A VIDEO OF WHAT THAT DOES TO THE CELL THE NORMAL CELL IF YOU LOOKED AT IT UNDER THE MICROSCOPE WOULD HAVE A NUCLEUS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CELL WHICH IS NICE AND ROUND AND SMOOTH IN ITS BOUNDARIES
FrancisCollins_2012P@359.57:368.12 AND IT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE THAT A PROGERIA CELL ON THE OTHER HAND BECAUSE OF THIS TOXIC PROTEIN CALLED PROGERIN HAS THESE LUMPS AND BUMPS IN IT
FrancisCollins_2012P@368.27:385.41 SO WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO AFTER DISCOVERING THIS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE IS TO COME UP WITH A WAY TO TRY TO CORRECT THAT WELL AGAIN BY KNOWING SOMETHING ABOUT THE MOLECULAR PATHWAYS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO PICK ONE OF THOSE MANY MANY COMPOUNDS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN USEFUL AND TRY IT OUT
FrancisCollins_2012P@385.41:392.67 IN AN EXPERIMENT DONE IN CELL CULTURE AND SHOWN HERE IN A CARTOON IF YOU TAKE THAT PARTICULAR COMPOUND
FrancisCollins_2012P@392.95:400.02 AND YOU ADD IT TO THAT CELL THAT HAS PROGERIA AND YOU WATCH TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN JUST SEVENTY TWO HOURS
FrancisCollins_2012P@400.18:409.84 THAT CELL BECOMES FOR ALL PURPOSES THAT WE CAN DETERMINE ALMOST LIKE A NORMAL CELL WELL THAT WAS EXCITING BUT WOULD IT ACTUALLY WORK IN A REAL HUMAN BEING
FrancisCollins_2012P@409.84:420.41 THIS HAS LED IN THE SPACE OF ONLY FOUR YEARS FROM THE TIME THE GENE WAS DISCOVERED TO THE START OF A CLINICAL TRIAL TO A TEST OF THAT VERY COMPOUND AND THE KIDS THAT YOU SEE HERE
FrancisCollins_2012P@420.54:438.4 ALL VOLUNTEERED TO BE PART OF THIS TWENTY EIGHT OF THEM AND YOU CAN SEE AS SOON AS THE PICTURE COMES UP THAT THEY ARE IN FACT A REMARKABLE GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE ALL AFFLICTED BY THIS DISEASE ALL LOOKING QUITE SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER AND INSTEAD OF TELLING YOU MORE ABOUT IT I 'M GOING TO INVITE ONE OF THEM
FrancisCollins_2012P@438.47:455.52 SAM BERNS FROM BOSTON WHO 'S HERE THIS MORNING TO COME UP ON THE STAGE AND TELL US ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE AS A CHILD AFFECTED WITH PROGERIA SAM IS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD HIS PARENTS SCOTT BERNS AND LESLIE GORDON BOTH PHYSICIANS ARE HERE WITH US THIS MORNING AS WELL SAM PLEASE HAVE A SEAT
FrancisCollins_2012P@463.53:469.06 SO SAM WHY DON 'T YOU TELL THESE FOLKS WHAT IT 'S LIKE BEING AFFECTED WITH THIS CONDITION CALLED PROGERIA
FrancisCollins_2012P@482.85:497.15 BUT WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING THAT I REALLY DO WANT TO DO THAT PROGERIA GETS IN THE WAY OF LIKE MARCHING BAND OR UMPIRING WE ALWAYS FIND A WAY TO DO IT AND THAT JUST SHOWS THAT PROGERIA ISN 'T IN CONTROL OF MY LIFE
FrancisCollins_2012P@510.99:516.46 FIFTEEN YEARS AND THAT JUST SHOWS THE DRIVE THAT RESEARCHERS CAN HAVE
FrancisCollins_2012P@522.99:538.81 AND IT SHOWS THAT IF THAT DRIVE EXISTS ANYBODY CAN CURE ANY DISEASE AND HOPEFULLY PROGERIA CAN BE CURED IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND SO WE CAN ELIMINATE THOSE FOUR THOUSAND DISEASES THAT FRANCIS WAS TALKING ABOUT
FrancisCollins_2012P@549.13:553.63 BY THE WAY A STRAIGHT A PLUS STUDENT IN THE NINTH GRADE IN HIS SCHOOL IN BOSTON
FrancisCollins_2012P@572.14:585.44 SO I JUST WANT TO SAY A COUPLE MORE THINGS ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR STORY AND THEN TRY TO GENERALIZE HOW COULD WE HAVE STORIES OF SUCCESS ALL OVER THE PLACE FOR THESE DISEASES AS SAM SAYS THESE FOUR THOUSAND THAT ARE WAITING FOR ANSWERS
FrancisCollins_2012P@585.44:600.69 YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED THAT THE DRUG THAT IS NOW IN CLINICAL TRIAL FOR PROGERIA IS NOT A DRUG THAT WAS DESIGNED FOR THAT IT 'S SUCH A RARE DISEASE IT WOULD BE HARD FOR A COMPANY TO JUSTIFY SPENDING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO GENERATE A DRUG THIS IS A DRUG THAT WAS DEVELOPED FOR CANCER
FrancisCollins_2012P@600.69:605.61 TURNED OUT IT DIDN 'T WORK VERY WELL FOR CANCER BUT IT HAS EXACTLY THE RIGHT PROPERTIES THE RIGHT SHAPE
FrancisCollins_2012P@605.61:608.13 TO WORK FOR PROGERIA AND THAT 'S WHAT 'S HAPPENED
FrancisCollins_2012P@611.44:631.23 COULD WE IN FACT ENCOURAGE ALL THE COMPANIES THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT HAVE DRUGS IN THEIR FREEZERS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE SAFE IN HUMANS BUT HAVE NEVER ACTUALLY SUCCEEDED IN TERMS OF BEING EFFECTIVE FOR THE TREATMENTS THEY WERE TRIED FOR NOW WE 'RE LEARNING ABOUT ALL THESE NEW MOLECULAR PATHWAYS SOME OF THOSE COULD BE REPOSITIONED OR REPURPOSED OR WHATEVER WORD YOU WANT TO USE
FrancisCollins_2012P@631.23:635.09 FOR NEW APPLICATIONS BASICALLY TEACHING OLD DRUGS NEW TRICKS
FrancisCollins_2012P@635.09:643.14 THAT COULD BE A PHENOMENAL VALUABLE ACTIVITY WE HAVE MANY DISCUSSIONS NOW BETWEEN NIH AND COMPANIES ABOUT DOING THIS THAT ARE LOOKING VERY PROMISING
FrancisCollins_2012P@643.14:659.08 AND YOU COULD EXPECT QUITE A LOT TO COME FROM THIS THERE ARE QUITE A NUMBER OF SUCCESS STORIES ONE CAN POINT TO ABOUT HOW THIS HAS LED TO MAJOR ADVANCES THE FIRST DRUG FOR HIV AIDS WAS NOT DEVELOPED FOR HIV AIDS IT WAS DEVELOPED FOR CANCER IT WAS AZT IT DIDN 'T WORK VERY WELL FOR CANCER
FrancisCollins_2012P@659.08:669.85 BUT BECAME THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL ANTIRETROVIRAL AND YOU CAN SEE FROM THE TABLE THERE ARE OTHERS AS WELL SO HOW DO WE ACTUALLY MAKE THAT A MORE GENERALIZABLE EFFORT WELL WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A PARTNERSHIP
FrancisCollins_2012P@669.85:675.27 BETWEEN ACADEMIA GOVERNMENT THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND PATIENT ORGANIZATIONS TO MAKE THAT SO
FrancisCollins_2012P@695.24:700.47 HOW DO WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE WHETHER DRUGS ARE SAFE BEFORE WE GIVE THEM TO PEOPLE WE TEST THEM ON ANIMALS
FrancisCollins_2012P@700.58:719.12 AND IT 'S NOT ALL THAT RELIABLE AND IT 'S COSTLY AND IT 'S TIME CONSUMING SUPPOSE WE COULD DO THIS INSTEAD ON HUMAN CELLS YOU PROBABLY KNOW IF YOU 'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE SCIENCE LITERATURE THAT YOU CAN NOW TAKE A SKIN CELL AND ENCOURAGE IT TO BECOME A LIVER CELL OR A HEART CELL OR A KIDNEY CELL OR A BRAIN CELL FOR ANY OF US
FrancisCollins_2012P@719.12:729.47 SO WHAT IF YOU USED THOSE CELLS AS YOUR TEST FOR WHETHER A DRUG IS GOING TO WORK AND WHETHER IT 'S GOING TO BE SAFE HERE YOU SEE A PICTURE OF A LUNG ON A CHIP
FrancisCollins_2012P@729.47:733.03 THIS IS SOMETHING CREATED BY THE WYSS INSTITUTE IN BOSTON
FrancisCollins_2012P@733.03:750.58 AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE HERE IF WE CAN RUN THE LITTLE VIDEO IS TO TAKE CELLS FROM AN INDIVIDUAL TURN THEM INTO THE KINDS OF CELLS THAT ARE PRESENT IN THE LUNG AND DETERMINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU ADDED TO THIS VARIOUS DRUG COMPOUNDS TO SEE IF THEY ARE TOXIC OR SAFE YOU CAN SEE THIS CHIP EVEN BREATHES
FrancisCollins_2012P@750.58:759.3 IT HAS AN AIR CHANNEL IT HAS A BLOOD CHANNEL AND IT HAS CELLS IN BETWEEN THAT ALLOW YOU TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ADD A COMPOUND ARE THOSE CELLS HAPPY OR NOT
FrancisCollins_2012P@759.3:768.77 YOU CAN DO THIS SAME KIND OF CHIP TECHNOLOGY FOR KIDNEYS FOR HEARTS FOR MUSCLES ALL THE PLACES WHERE YOU WANT TO SEE WHETHER A DRUG IS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM FOR THE LIVER
FrancisCollins_2012P@768.77:786.53 AND ULTIMATELY BECAUSE YOU CAN DO THIS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL WE COULD EVEN SEE THIS MOVING TO THE POINT WHERE THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND TEST MEDICINES WILL BE YOU ON A CHIP WHAT WE 'RE TRYING TO SAY HERE IS THE INDIVIDUALIZING OF THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING DRUGS AND TESTING THEIR SAFETY
FrancisCollins_2012P@786.53:790.77 SO LET ME SUM UP WE ARE IN A REMARKABLE MOMENT HERE
FrancisCollins_2012P@790.8:798.31 FOR ME AT NIH NOW FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME WHERE THERE WAS MORE EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE POTENTIAL THAT LIES IN FRONT OF US
FrancisCollins_2012P@798.31:807.87 WE HAVE MADE ALL THESE DISCOVERIES POURING OUT OF LABORATORIES ACROSS THE WORLD WHAT DO WE NEED TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS FIRST OF ALL WE NEED RESOURCES THIS IS RESEARCH THAT 'S HIGH RISK
FrancisCollins_2012P@807.87:825.51 SOMETIMES HIGH COST THE PAYOFF IS ENORMOUS BOTH IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH WE NEED TO SUPPORT THAT SECOND WE NEED NEW KINDS OF PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN ACADEMIA AND GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND PATIENT ORGANIZATIONS JUST LIKE THE ONE I 'VE BEEN DESCRIBING HERE IN TERMS OF THE WAY IN WHICH WE COULD GO AFTER REPURPOSING NEW COMPOUNDS
FrancisCollins_2012P@825.51:830.72 AND THIRD AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANT WE NEED TALENT WE NEED THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST
FrancisCollins_2012P@844.1:858.03 AND TURN IT INTO SOMETHING WHICH WILL IN FACT KNOCK OUT DISEASE THAT 'S MY GOAL I HOPE THAT 'S YOUR GOAL I THINK IT 'LL BE THE GOAL OF THE POETS AND THE MUPPETS AND THE SURFERS AND THE BANKERS AND ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO JOIN THIS STAGE
FrancisCollins_2012P@858.03:866.56 AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE 'RE TRYING TO DO HERE AND WHY IT MATTERS IT MATTERS FOR NOW IT MATTERS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IF YOU DON 'T BELIEVE ME JUST ASK SAM
