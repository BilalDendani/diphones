NatashaTsakos_2009@29.92:38.57 WILL SIT IN ONE ROOM FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS AND LISTEN THE IDEA THAT IN THAT ROOM AT THAT MOMENT EVERYONE
NatashaTsakos_2009@47.06:54.88 AT THAT MOMENT WE TRANSCEND SPACE AND TIME TOGETHER THEATER AWAKENS OUR SENSES AND OPENS THE DOOR TO OUR IMAGINATION
NatashaTsakos_2009@55.53:65.03 AND OUR ABILITY TO IMAGINE IS WHAT MAKES US EXPLORERS OUR ABILITY TO IMAGINE MAKES US INVENTORS AND CREATORS AND UNIQUE
NatashaTsakos_2009@74.71:83.47 A MODERN DAY BUSINESS MAN GOING TO WORK WITH HIS LIFE IN A SUITCASE STUCK BETWEEN DREAM AND REALITY AND NOT ABLE TO DECIPHER THE TWO
NatashaTsakos_2009@83.95:94.42 I WANTED UPWAKE TO HAVE THE SAME AUDIOVISUAL QUALITIES AS A MOVIE WOULD AND I WANTED TO LET MY IMAGINATION RUN WILD SO I BEGAN DRAWING THE STORY THAT WAS MOVING IN MY HEAD
NatashaTsakos_2009@98.57:107.18 IF ANTOINE DE SAINT EXUPERY THE AUTHOR OF THE LITTLE PRINCE WERE HERE HE WOULD HAVE DRAWN THREE HOLES INSIDE THAT BOX AND TOLD YOU YOUR SHEEP WAS INSIDE
NatashaTsakos_2009@107.82:117.19 BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY ENOUGH THINGS WILL APPEAR THIS IS NOT A BOX THESE ARE THE RENDERINGS OF MY IMAGINATION FROM HEAD TO PAPER TO SCREEN TO LIFE
NatashaTsakos_2009@118.06:129.51 IN UPWAKE BUILDINGS WEAR SUITS ZERO TAP DANCES ON A GIANT KEYBOARD CLONES HIMSELF WITH A SCANNER TAMES AND WHIPS THE COMPUTER MICE SAILS AWAY INTO DREAMSCAPE FROM A SINGLE PIECE OF PAPER
NatashaTsakos_2009@130.21:137.65 AND LAUNCHES INTO SPACE I WANTED TO CREATE ENVIRONMENTS THAT MOVED AND MORPHED LIKE AN ILLUSIONIST GO FROM ONE WORLD TO ANOTHER IN A SECOND
NatashaTsakos_2009@138.24:150.55 I WANTED TO HAVE HUMOR BEAUTY SIMPLICITY AND COMPLEXITY AND USE METAPHORS TO SUGGEST IDEAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW FOR EXAMPLE ZERO DEEJAYS DREAM AND REALITY
NatashaTsakos_2009@369.50:377.06 THE USE OF ANIMATION AND PROJECTION WAS A PROCESS OF DISCOVERY I DIDN'T USE IT AS A SPECIAL EFFECT BUT AS A PARTNER ON STAGE
NatashaTsakos_2009@377.39:384.79 THERE ARE NO SPECIAL EFFECTS IN UPWAKE NO ARTIFICE IT'S AS LAVISH AND INTRICATE AS IT IS SIMPLE AND MINIMAL
NatashaTsakos_2009@385.79:398.38 THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR FRAMES FOUR AND A HALF YEARS AND COMMISSIONS LATER WHAT STARTED AS A ONE PERSON SHOW BECAME A COLLABORATIVE WORK OF NINETEEN MOST TALENTED ARTISTS AND HERE ARE SOME EXCERPTS
NatashaTsakos_2009@570.52:581.61 SHOW THAT WE'RE NOW BEGINNING TO TOUR AND IN AUSTIN TEXAS I WAS ASKED TO GIVE SMALL DEMONSTRATIONS IN SCHOOLS DURING THE AFTERNOON WHEN I ARRIVED AT ONE OF THE SCHOOLS I CERTAINLY DID NOT EXPECT THIS
NatashaTsakos_2009@582.16:589.92 SIX HUNDRED KIDS PACKED IN A GYMNASIUM WAITING I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS PERFORMING WITH OUT ANIMATION COSTUME REALLY AND MAKE UP
NatashaTsakos_2009@590.41:601.35 BUT THE TEACHERS CAME TO ME AFTERWARD AND TOLD ME THEY HADN'T SEEN THE KIDS THAT ATTENTIVE AND I THINK THE REASON WHY IS THAT I WAS ABLE TO USE THEIR LANGUAGE AND THEIR REALITY IN ORDER TO TRANSPORT THEM INTO ANOTHER
NatashaTsakos_2009@621.69:629.82 IT'S AS MUCH ABOUT BRINGING NEW DISCIPLINES INSIDE THIS BOX AS IT IS ABOUT TAKING THEATER OUT OF ITS BOX
NatashaTsakos_2009@630.24:640.78 AS A STREET PERFORMER I HAVE LEARNED THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO CONNECT AND THAT USUALLY IF YOU'RE A BIT EXTRAORDINARY IF YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY OF HUMAN APPEARANCE THEN PEOPLE
NatashaTsakos_2009@643.22:655.31 IT'S AS THOUGH YOU MADE SOMETHING RESONATE WITHIN THEM IT'S AS THOUGH THE MYSTERY OF THE PERSON THEY'RE INTERACTING WITH AND CONNECTING ALLOWS THEM TO BE THEMSELVES JUST A BIT MORE BECAUSE THROUGH YOUR MASK THEY LET THEIRS GO
NatashaTsakos_2009@656.26:664.88 BEING HUMAN IS AN ART FORM I KNOW THEATER CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PEOPLE 'S LIVES AND I KNOW THEATER CAN HEAL I'VE WORKED AS A DOCTOR CLOWN IN A HOSPITAL FOR TWO YEARS
NatashaTsakos_2009@665.08:674.49 I HAVE SEEN SICK KIDS AND SAD PARENTS AND DOCTORS BE LIFTED AND TRANSPORTED IN MOMENTS OF PURE JOY I KNOW THEATER UNITES US
NatashaTsakos_2009@675.13:683.43 ZERO WANTS TO ENGAGE THE GENERATION OF TODAY AND TOMORROW TELL VARIOUS STORIES THROUGH DIFFERENT MEDIUMS COMIC BOOKS

NatashaTsakos_2009@775.30:782.42 THERE IS A REVOLUTION IN THE WAY THAT WE THINK IN THE WAY THAT WE SHARE AND THE WAY THAT WE EXPRESS OUR STORIES
NatashaTsakos_2009@782.93:791.05 OUR EVOLUTION THIS IS A TIME OF COMMUNICATION CONNECTION AND CREATIVE COLLABORATION
