ReginaDugan_2012 I 'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT A MAGICAL PLACE CALLED DARPA WHERE SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS DEFY THE IMPOSSIBLE AND REFUSE TO FEAR FAILURE
ReginaDugan_2012 NOW THESE TWO IDEAS ARE CONNECTED MORE THAN YOU MAY REALIZE
ReginaDugan_2012 BECAUSE WHEN YOU REMOVE THE FEAR OF FAILURE
ReginaDugan_2012 IMPOSSIBLE THINGS SUDDENLY BECOME
ReginaDugan_2012 ASK YOURSELF THIS QUESTION
ReginaDugan_2012 WHAT WOULD YOU ATTEMPT TO DO
ReginaDugan_2012 IF YOU KNEW YOU COULD NOT FAIL
ReginaDugan_2012 IF YOU REALLY ASK YOURSELF THIS QUESTION YOU CAN 'T HELP BUT FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
ReginaDugan_2012 I FEEL A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE
ReginaDugan_2012 BECAUSE WHEN YOU ASK IT YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE FEAR OF FAILURE CONSTRAINS YOU
ReginaDugan_2012 HOW IT KEEPS US FROM ATTEMPTING GREAT THINGS
ReginaDugan_2012 AND LIFE GETS DULL AMAZING THINGS STOP HAPPENING SURE GOOD THINGS HAPPEN
ReginaDugan_2012 BUT AMAZING THINGS STOP HAPPENING
ReginaDugan_2012 I 'M NOT ENCOURAGING FAILURE
ReginaDugan_2012 I 'M DISCOURAGING FEAR OF FAILURE
ReginaDugan_2012 BECAUSE IT 'S NOT FAILURE ITSELF THAT CONSTRAINS US THE PATH TO TRULY NEW NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE THINGS ALWAYS HAS FAILURE ALONG THE WAY
ReginaDugan_2012 CLEMENCEAU SAID
ReginaDugan_2012 LIFE GETS INTERESTING WHEN WE FAIL
ReginaDugan_2012 IN OCTOBER OF ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND THREE THE PREVAILING OPINION OF EXPERT AERODYNAMICISTS
ReginaDugan_2012 THE FLIGHT LASTED TWELVE SECONDS
ReginaDugan_2012 AND COVERED ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FEET
ReginaDugan_2012 THAT WAS ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND THREE ONE YEAR LATER THE NEXT DECLARATIONS OF IMPOSSIBILITIES BEGAN FERDINAND FOCH A FRENCH ARMY GENERAL CREDITED WITH HAVING ONE OF THE MOST ORIGINAL AND SUBTLE MINDS IN THE FRENCH ARMY
ReginaDugan_2012 BUT OF NO MILITARY VALUE
ReginaDugan_2012 FORTY YEARS LATER AERO EXPERTS COINED THE TERM TRANSONIC THEY DEBATED SHOULD IT HAVE ONE S OR TWO
ReginaDugan_2012 YOU SEE THEY WERE HAVING TROUBLE IN THIS FLIGHT REGIME AND IT WASN 'T AT ALL CLEAR THAT WE COULD FLY FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF SOUND
ReginaDugan_2012 IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN THERE WAS NO WIND TUNNEL DATA BEYOND MACH ZERO POINT EIGHT FIVE
ReginaDugan_2012 AND HE FLEW TOWARDS AN UNKNOWN
ReginaDugan_2012 THAN IN ALL U TWO MISSIONS COMBINED
ReginaDugan_2012 IT TOOK A LOT OF FAILURES TO GET THERE
ReginaDugan_2012 SINCE WE TOOK TO THE SKY WE HAVE WANTED TO FLY
ReginaDugan_2012 THAT 'S STILL TRUE TODAY
ReginaDugan_2012 TODAY WE DON 'T TALK ABOUT FLYING TRANSONICALLY
ReginaDugan_2012 OR EVEN SUPERSONICALLY WE TALK ABOUT FLYING HYPERSONICALLY
ReginaDugan_2012 NOT MACH TWO OR MACH THREE MACH TWENTY
ReginaDugan_2012 AT MACH TWENTY WE CAN FLY FROM
ReginaDugan_2012 NEW YORK TO LONG BEACH IN ELEVEN MINUTES AND TWENTY SECONDS
ReginaDugan_2012 AND WE ARE FLYING IT OR TRYING TO
ReginaDugan_2012 MANEUVERING AIRCRAFT EVER BUILT
ReginaDugan_2012 IT 'S BOOSTED TO NEAR SPACE ATOP A MINOTAUR IV ROCKET NOW THE MINOTAUR IV HAS TOO MUCH IMPULSE SO WE HAVE TO BLEED IT OFF BY FLYING THE ROCKET AT AN EIGHTY NINE DEGREE ANGLE OF ATTACK FOR PORTIONS OF THE TRAJECTORY
ReginaDugan_2012 AND IT 'S POINTED AT THE HYPERSONIC GLIDER
ReginaDugan_2012 THIS IS THE ACTUAL ROCKETCAM FOOTAGE FROM FLIGHT ONE
ReginaDugan_2012 NOW TO CONCEAL THE SHAPE WE CHANGED THE ASPECT RATIO A LITTLE BIT BUT THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE THIRD STAGE OF THE ROCKET
ReginaDugan_2012 LOOKING AT THE UNMANNED GLIDER
ReginaDugan_2012 AS IT HEADS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE BACK TOWARDS EARTH
ReginaDugan_2012 WE 'VE FLOWN TWICE
ReginaDugan_2012 BUT WE COLLECTED MORE HYPERSONIC FLIGHT DATA THAN IN THIRTY YEARS OF GROUND BASED TESTING COMBINED
ReginaDugan_2012 AND IN THE SECOND FLIGHT
ReginaDugan_2012 THREE MINUTES OF FULLY CONTROLLED AERODYNAMIC FLIGHT
ReginaDugan_2012 YOU CAN 'T LEARN TO FLY AT MACH TWENTY UNLESS YOU FLY
ReginaDugan_2012 AND WHILE THERE 'S NO SUBSTITUTE FOR SPEED MANEUVERABILITY IS A VERY CLOSE SECOND
ReginaDugan_2012 IF A MACH TWENTY GLIDER TAKES ELEVEN MINUTES AND TWENTY SECONDS TO GET FROM NEW YORK TO LONG BEACH A HUMMINGBIRD
ReginaDugan_2012 BUT THEY ARE MANEUVERABLE
ReginaDugan_2012 SMALL ENOUGH AND MANEUVERABLE ENOUGH TO DO SO
ReginaDugan_2012 THIS IS A HUMMINGBIRD DRONE
ReginaDugan_2012 IT CAN FLY IN ALL DIRECTIONS
ReginaDugan_2012 IS EQUIPPED WITH A VIDEO CAMERA
ReginaDugan_2012 IT WEIGHS LESS THAN ONE AA BATTERY
ReginaDugan_2012 IT DOES NOT EAT NECTAR
ReginaDugan_2012 IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IT FLEW FOR A WHOPPING TWENTY SECONDS
ReginaDugan_2012 A YEAR LATER TWO MINUTES THEN SIX EVENTUALLY ELEVEN
ReginaDugan_2012 MANY PROTOTYPES CRASHED
ReginaDugan_2012 IT
ReginaDugan_2012 AND MAKE AMAZING NEW THINGS
ReginaDugan_2012 WITH THE OCCASIONAL CLUMSINESS OF A HUMAN
ReginaDugan_2012 OR PERHAPS SPIDER MAN WILL ONE DAY BE GECKO MAN
ReginaDugan_2012 A GECKO CAN SUPPORT ITS ENTIRE BODY WEIGHT WITH ONE TOE
ReginaDugan_2012 ONE SQUARE MILLIMETER OF A GECKO 'S FOOTPAD HAS FOURTEEN THOUSAND HAIR LIKE STRUCTURES CALLED SETAE THEY ARE USED TO HELP IT GRIP TO SURFACES USING INTERMOLECULAR FORCES
ReginaDugan_2012 TODAY WE CAN MANUFACTURE STRUCTURES THAT MIMIC THE HAIRS OF A GECKO 'S FOOT THE RESULT
ReginaDugan_2012 CAN SUPPORT A STATIC LOAD OF SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY POUNDS THAT 'S ENOUGH TO STICK SIX FORTY TWO INCH PLASMA TV 'S TO YOUR WALL NO NAILS
ReginaDugan_2012 SO MUCH FOR VELCRO RIGHT
ReginaDugan_2012 IN THE WORLD OF GODZILLA SPIDER MITES WE CAN MAKE MILLIONS OF MIRRORS EACH ONE FIFTH THE DIAMETER OF A HUMAN HAIR MOVING AT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TIMES PER SECOND TO MAKE LARGE SCREEN DISPLAYS SO THAT WE CAN WATCH MOVIES LIKE GODZILLA IN HIGH DEF
ReginaDugan_2012 AND IF WE CAN BUILD MACHINES AT THAT SCALE WHAT ABOUT EIFFEL TOWER LIKE TRUSSES AT THE MICROSCALE
ReginaDugan_2012 TODAY WE ARE MAKING METALS THAT ARE LIGHTER THAN STYROFOAM SO LIGHT THEY CAN SIT ATOP A DANDELION PUFF AND BE BLOWN AWAY WITH A WISP OF AIR
ReginaDugan_2012 FROM THE SMALLEST WISP OF AIR TO THE POWERFUL FORCES OF NATURE 'S STORMS THERE ARE
ReginaDugan_2012 FORTY FOUR LIGHTNING STRIKES PER SECOND AROUND THE GLOBE EACH LIGHTNING BOLT HEATS THE AIR TO FORTY FOUR THOUSAND DEGREES
ReginaDugan_2012 EXPERIMENTS SUGGEST THAT LIGHTNING COULD BE THE NEXT GPS
ReginaDugan_2012 TIM USES HIS THOUGHTS TO CONTROL AN ADVANCED PROSTHETIC ARM
ReginaDugan_2012 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
ReginaDugan_2012 A HUMAN HAS CONTROLLED A ROBOT
ReginaDugan_2012 WITH THOUGHT ALONE
ReginaDugan_2012 AND IT IS THE FIRST TIME THAT TIM HAS HELD KATIE 'S HAND IN SEVEN YEARS
ReginaDugan_2012 AND THIS GREEN GOO MAY SOMEDAY MATTER TO YOU
ReginaDugan_2012 THIS GREEN GOO IS PERHAPS THE VACCINE THAT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE
ReginaDugan_2012 IT WAS MADE IN TOBACCO PLANTS
ReginaDugan_2012 TOBACCO PLANTS CAN MAKE MILLIONS OF DOSES OF VACCINE IN WEEKS INSTEAD OF MONTHS
ReginaDugan_2012 AND IT MIGHT JUST BE THE FIRST HEALTHY USE OF TOBACCO
ReginaDugan_2012 AND IF IT SEEMS FAR FETCHED THAT TOBACCO PLANTS COULD MAKE PEOPLE HEALTHY WHAT ABOUT GAMERS THAT COULD SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT EXPERTS CAN 'T SOLVE
ReginaDugan_2012 LAST SEPTEMBER
ReginaDugan_2012 THE GAMERS OF FOLDIT
ReginaDugan_2012 SOLVED THE THREE DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE RETROVIRAL PROTEASE THAT CONTRIBUTES TO AIDS IN RHESUS MONKEYS NOW UNDERSTANDING THIS STRUCTURE IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPING TREATMENTS
ReginaDugan_2012 FOR FIFTEEN YEARS IT WAS UNSOLVED
ReginaDugan_2012 IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY
ReginaDugan_2012 THE GAMERS OF FOLDIT SOLVED IT IN FIFTEEN DAYS
ReginaDugan_2012 NOW THEY WERE ABLE TO DO SO BY WORKING TOGETHER THEY WERE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY 'RE CONNECTED BY THE INTERNET AND OTHERS ALSO CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET USED IT AS AN INSTRUMENT OF DEMOCRACY AND TOGETHER THEY CHANGED THE FATE OF THEIR NATION
ReginaDugan_2012 THE INTERNET IS HOME TO TWO BILLION PEOPLE OR THIRTY PERCENT OF THE WORLD 'S POPULATION
ReginaDugan_2012 IT ALLOWS US TO CONTRIBUTE
ReginaDugan_2012 AND TO BE HEARD AS INDIVIDUALS
ReginaDugan_2012 IT ALLOWS US TO AMPLIFY
ReginaDugan_2012 THAT 'S ALL THAT MADE IT THROUGH AN L AND AN O AND THEN A BUFFER OVERFLOW CRASHED THE SYSTEM
ReginaDugan_2012 NOW A WORLDWIDE FORCE
ReginaDugan_2012 SO WHO ARE THESE SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS
ReginaDugan_2012 AT A MAGICAL PLACE CALLED DARPA
ReginaDugan_2012 THEY ARE NERDS
ReginaDugan_2012 AND THEY ARE HEROES AMONG US
ReginaDugan_2012 THEY CHALLENGE EXISTING PERSPECTIVES AT THE EDGES OF SCIENCE AND UNDER THE MOST DEMANDING OF CONDITIONS THEY REMIND US
ReginaDugan_2012 THAT WE CAN CHANGE THE WORLD
ReginaDugan_2012 IF WE DEFY THE IMPOSSIBLE
ReginaDugan_2012 AND WE REFUSE TO FEAR FAILURE
ReginaDugan_2012 THEY REMIND US THAT WE ALL
ReginaDugan_2012 HAVE NERD POWER
ReginaDugan_2012 SOMETIMES WE JUST FORGET
ReginaDugan_2012 YOU SEE THERE WAS A TIME WHEN YOU WEREN 'T AFRAID OF FAILURE WHEN YOU WERE A GREAT ARTIST OR A GREAT DANCER AND YOU COULD SING YOU WERE GOOD AT MATH
ReginaDugan_2012 YOU COULD BUILD THINGS YOU WERE AN ASTRONAUT AN ADVENTURER JACQUES COUSTEAU YOU COULD JUMP HIGHER RUN FASTER KICK HARDER THAN ANYONE YOU BELIEVED IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS AND YOU WERE
ReginaDugan_2012 SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS
ReginaDugan_2012 IF YOU KNEW YOU COULD NOT FAIL
ReginaDugan_2012 NOW I WANT TO SAY
ReginaDugan_2012 THIS IS NOT EASY
ReginaDugan_2012 IT 'S HARD TO HOLD ONTO THIS FEELING
ReginaDugan_2012 REALLY HARD I GUESS IN SOME WAY I SORT OF BELIEVE IT 'S SUPPOSED TO BE HARD DOUBT AND FEAR ALWAYS CREEP IN WE THINK SOMEONE ELSE SOMEONE SMARTER THAN US SOMEONE MORE CAPABLE SOMEONE WITH MORE RESOURCES WILL SOLVE THAT PROBLEM BUT THERE ISN 'T ANYONE ELSE
ReginaDugan_2012 TAKES A HAND AND SAYS
ReginaDugan_2012 LET ME HELP YOU BELIEVE
ReginaDugan_2012 JASON HARLEY DID THAT
ReginaDugan_2012 I SAW JASON NEARLY EVERY DAY SOMETIMES TWICE A DAY AND MORE SO THAN MOST HE SAW THE HIGHS AND THE LOWS THE CELEBRATIONS AND THE DISAPPOINTMENTS
ReginaDugan_2012 JASON SAT DOWN
ReginaDugan_2012 AND HE WROTE AN EMAIL
ReginaDugan_2012 HE WAS ENCOURAGING
ReginaDugan_2012 HE PROBABLY DIDN 'T REALIZE WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT WOULD MAKE
ReginaDugan_2012 IT MATTERED TO ME
ReginaDugan_2012 IN THAT MOMENT
ReginaDugan_2012 AND STILL TODAY
ReginaDugan_2012 WHEN I DOUBT
ReginaDugan_2012 WHEN I FEEL AFRAID WHEN I NEED TO RECONNECT WITH THAT FEELING
ReginaDugan_2012 I REMEMBER HIS WORDS
ReginaDugan_2012 THEY WERE SO POWERFUL
ReginaDugan_2012 THERE IS ONLY TIME ENOUGH
ReginaDugan_2012 TO IRON YOUR CAPE
ReginaDugan_2012 AND BACK TO THE SKIES FOR YOU
ReginaDugan_2012 SO THAT GLIDER OF YOURS THE MACH TWENTY GLIDER THE FIRST ONE NO CONTROL IT ENDED UP IN THE PACIFIC I THINK SOMEWHERE RD YEAH YEAH IT DID CA WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT SECOND FLIGHT YEAH IT ALSO WENT INTO THE PACIFIC CA BUT THIS TIME UNDER CONTROL
ReginaDugan_2012 CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE BEFORE WE LOST IT
ReginaDugan_2012 IT 'S AMAZING
ReginaDugan_2012 THE
ReginaDugan_2012 WE WONDERED IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DO IT AND YOU HAVE TO REVISIT THESE QUESTIONS OVER TIME
ReginaDugan_2012 IT WOULD BE INCONCEIVABLE FOR US TO DO THAT WORK
ReginaDugan_2012 IF WE DIDN 'T MAKE PEOPLE EXCITED AND UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE THINGS THAT WE DO AT THE SAME TIME
ReginaDugan_2012 IT 'S JUST THE NATURE OF WHAT WE DO NOW OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PUSH THAT
ReginaDugan_2012 ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POSSIBLY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR TEAM 'S BRILLIANCE
ReginaDugan_2012 MY JOB IS ONE OF THE MOST EXHILARATING JOBS YOU COULD HAVE
ReginaDugan_2012 I WORK WITH SOME OF THE MOST AMAZING PEOPLE
ReginaDugan_2012 AND SO YOU HAVE ON THE ONE HAND THIS TREMENDOUS LIFT OF WHAT 'S POSSIBLE AND THIS TREMENDOUS SERIOUSNESS OF WHAT IT MEANS
