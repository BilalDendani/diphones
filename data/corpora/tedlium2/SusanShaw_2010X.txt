SusanShaw_2010X@16.40:25.75 I AM A MARINE TOXICOLOGIST AND I'VE BEEN VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE GULF PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE MASSIVE APPLICATIONS OF THE TOXIC DISPERSANTS THE
SusanShaw_2010X@27.13:36.42 I'VE BEEN WORKING ON OCEAN POLLUTION FOR QUITE A LONG TIME THE IMPACTS ON MARINE LIFE AND PARTICULARLY THE IMPACTS ON MARINE MAMMALS
SusanShaw_2010X@37.03:47.38 AS IT TURNS OUT MARINE MAMMALS ARE AT THE TOP OF THIS FOOD CHAIN THAT WE'RE POURING MILLIONS OF TONS OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES INTO EVERY YEAR
SusanShaw_2010X@48.05:57.17 AND THEY ARE SHOWING THE SIGNS OF THIS I'M SORRY TO HAVE A SAD SLIDE LIKE THIS BUT NOT EVERYTHING IS ALL THAT HAPPY ESPECIALLY IN MY WORK
SusanShaw_2010X@59.71:72.31 ARE LOADED WITH TOXIC CHEMICALS IN THEIR BODY HUNDREDS OF COMPOUNDS ALL KINDS OF COMPOUNDS IT'S STAGGERING AND THEY'RE DYING OFF RATHER REGULARLY TENS OF THOUSANDS AROUND THE WORLD
SusanShaw_2010X@72.97:81.89 IT'S PREDICTED THEY MAY GO EXTINCT ABOUT A THIRD OF THEM WITHIN ABOUT THIRTY YEARS SO MY PROJECT IS ALONG THE NORTHWEST ATLANTIC
SusanShaw_2010X@82.22:92.73 IT'S CALLED SEALS AS SENTINELS WE'RE TRACKING POLLUTION AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD WEB IN MARINE MAMMALS AND FISH IT'S A REGION WIDE ECO TOXICOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION
SusanShaw_2010X@104.92:113.69 FROM THE CUSHIONS IN THE CHAIRS WE'RE ALL SITTING ON TO THE PLASTIC CASINGS OF OUR COMPUTERS OUR TELEVISION SETS AND SO ON
SusanShaw_2010X@114.13:123.39 SO WE ARE TRACKING HOW DO THESE THINGS GET FROM THE PRODUCTS INTO THE OCEAN WHICH IS THE FINAL SINK FOR THEM AND THERE'S QUITE A COMPLICATED PATHWAY FOR THAT
SusanShaw_2010X@124.14:131.55 BECAUSE AS THESE PRODUCTS AGE THEY GET CONCENTRATED IN DUST AND THEN THEY ALSO GET THROWN OUT SO THEY GO TO THE LANDFILLS
SusanShaw_2010X@132.01:143.68 THEY WIND UP IN WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS AS YOU ALL KNOW WE THROW OUT BILLIONS OF COMPUTERS AND TVS EVERY YEAR AND THOSE GO TO E WASTE DUMPS AND ALL THAT GETS INTO SURFACE WATERS EVENTUALLY REACHING THE OCEAN THE FINAL
SusanShaw_2010X@144.77:152.43 SO IN OUR STUDY WE DID FIND QUITE HIGH LEVELS AS WE EXPECTED OF THESE FLAME RETARDANTS IN THE HARBOR SEALS BODIES
SusanShaw_2010X@153.00:160.51 WE REPORTED THIS IT LED TO A BAN OF THIS NEURO TOXIC FLAME RETARDANT CALLED DECA IN MAINE WHERE I AM BASED
SusanShaw_2010X@160.87:172.35 AND ALSO THEN A PHASE OUT U S WIDE AT THE END OF LAST YEAR BUT WE SAID WELL ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OUR HARBOR SEALS AT LEAST WILL NOT BE BURSTING INTO FLAME ANYTIME SOON
SusanShaw_2010X@173.79:181.66 SO THEN I GOT REALLY CURIOUS MYSELF AS A TOXICOLOGIST AND I DONATED SOME BLOOD TO MY LAB AND SAID OKAY LET 'S DO IT
SusanShaw_2010X@181.95:193.26 WELL WE DETECTED ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS IN MY BLOOD AND I MUST SAY IF ANY OF YOU WOULD HAVE THIS DONE YOU'D PROBABLY FIND A SIMILAR PROFILE OR COCKTAIL AS THEY CALL IT
SusanShaw_2010X@193.99:202.04 BUT I WAS THE RECIPIENT OF A LOT OF FLAME RETARDANT MATERIAL FOR SOME REASON AND JUST TO POINT OUT THE LEVELS
SusanShaw_2010X@203.62:211.03 HAVE TEN TO FORTY TIMES HIGHER LEVELS OF THESE COMPOUNDS IN OUR BODIES THAN THE EUROPEANS WHY BECAUSE WE
SusanShaw_2010X@211.59:226.20 FLAME RETARDING EVERYTHING AND WE HAVE WEAK REGULATIONS FOR TOXIC CHEMICALS BUT LO AND BEHOLD I'M ONE OF THE HIGH END INDIVIDUALS LUCKY ME BUT THEN I THOUGHT WELL IN CASE OF A FIRE I MIGHT BE THE LAST ONE TO IGNITE
SusanShaw_2010X@229.34:242.54 SO ANYWAY HERE 'S THE PROBLEM AND IT IS A PROBLEM THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN THE GULF TODAY WE'RE NOT REGULATING CHEMICALS IN THIS COUNTRY PROPERLY WE'RE HARDLY REGULATING THEM AT ALL AND WE'RE LETTING INDUSTRY RUN THE SHOW
SusanShaw_2010X@242.91:250.76 AND JACKIE SAVITZ SPOKE THIS MORNING ABOUT BIG OIL AND THE PROPAGANDA AND HOW WE'RE ALL BRAINWASHED WITH
SusanShaw_2010X@252.35:258.20 YOU KNOW LIES AND SO FORTH WELL BIG CHEMICAL IS WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE
SusanShaw_2010X@258.54:269.78 AND THEY'RE ALLOWED TO KEEP TRADE SECRETS SO THEY DON'T EVEN GIVE THE INGREDIENTS OUT PLUS THEY DON'T GIVE HEALTH AND SAFETY DATA SO CONSEQUENTLY THEY CANNOT BE REGULATED BEFORE THEY GO TO MARKET
SusanShaw_2010X@271.05:281.95 SO IT'S A CASE OF INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS NOT ON THE PRODUCER SO I THEN WAS INVITED TO GO TO THE GULF IN MAY I WENT DOWN
SusanShaw_2010X@282.77:292.12 ON A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION TO LOOK INTO DISPERSANTS AND HOW THEY'RE GOING INTO THE WATER COLUMN AND SO FORTH AND I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS THE ONLY
SusanShaw_2010X@303.67:313.47 AND I DID GET SICK I GOT A FEROCIOUS SORE THROAT TWO DAYS LATER I FELT LIKE MY THROAT WAS ON FIRE BUT IT DID PASS
SusanShaw_2010X@313.89:321.80 AND WHAT I DID SEE IN THE WATER AS WE WENT DOWN WHAT REALLY SHOCKED ME AND IT'S HAUNTED ME EVER SINCE BECAUSE I COULD SEE THE DROPLETS OF OIL
SusanShaw_2010X@336.17:345.90 AND YOU COULD JUST SEE THE WEB OF DEATH AS YOU GO DOWN IN THE WATER COLUMN WELL YOU KNOW WE GOT INTO THIS IN THE BEGINNING AS A TRADE OFF THEY
SusanShaw_2010X@347.05:359.20 BETWEEN THE WETLANDS VERSUS THE OCEAN DEPTH AND I DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT DECISION AT THE TIME I STILL DON 'T THE DECISION WAS TO PROTECT THE MARSHES WHEN THE OIL GETS INTO THE MARSHES YOU CAN'T GET IT OUT
SusanShaw_2010X@372.54:383.25 SO THIS SHOWS OIL ON THE SURFACE YOU CAN SEE IT GETTING UP INTO THE MANGROVE BUT IT IS NOT HARMING THE CORALS OR THE SEA GRASS RIGHT SO HERE WE HAVE
SusanShaw_2010X@384.21:397.58 OTHER SCENARIO IF YOU DISPERSE THE SEA GRASS AND THE CORALS ARE GETTING HIT PRETTY HARD BUT YOU'RE SAVING THE MANGROVE SO THIS TO ME IS LIKE GOING TO THE EYE DOCTOR OKAY IS IT BETTER WITH ONE OR TWO
SusanShaw_2010X@398.92:406.32 THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE RELEASED SO DARN MUCH OF THIS STUFF WE'RE CLIMBING UP TO TWO MILLION GALLONS
SusanShaw_2010X@407.32:415.64 VERY QUICKLY AND THEN THERE'S THE PROBLEM OF THE PLUMES WHAT PLUMES IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE
SusanShaw_2010X@433.35:439.23 HAVING BEEN IN THAT WATER JUST FOR THE SHORT TIME I WAS THERE I CAN TELL YOU IT IS NOT HEAT STRESS
SusanShaw_2010X@439.74:448.58 THERE ARE VOLUMES OF VOLATILE PETROLEUM FUMES COMING OFF THAT WATER PLUS THE COREXIT WHICH HAS SOLVENT IN IT SO
SusanShaw_2010X@478.28:489.35 WE KNOW THAT FROM THE EXXON VALDEZ SPILL BY THE WAY SO WHAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE PUTTING COMPOUNDS WITH PETROLEUM SOLVENTS ONTO A PETROLEUM SPILL DOES THIS MAKE SENSE
SusanShaw_2010X@489.92:503.70 SO THIS IS THE WAY IT WORKS AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS CUTE LITTLE THING THAT HAPPENS HERE IT'S A MICELLE MICELLES FORM AROUND THE OIL AND WHAT HAPPENS FIRST IS THE SOLVENTS BREAK INTO THE OIL
SusanShaw_2010X@504.18:516.04 THE LIPID MEMBRANE THEY LET THE SURFACTANTS IN THERE THE SURFACTANTS WHICH ARE LIKE THINGS WE USE ON FAST FOOD WRAPPERS THEY GRAB AROUND THE DROPLETS OF OIL AND THEY MAKE LITTLE TINY DROPLETS WITH
SusanShaw_2010X@516.89:528.11 NICE LITTLE SURFACTANT EDGES TO THEM THE THING TO REMEMBER ABOUT THE MICELLES THESE LITTLE FLOATING GLOBULES OF TOXIN IS THEY ARE THERE TO DELIVER
SusanShaw_2010X@528.84:536.03 LIKE THE FEDEX GUYS AND IF YOU'RE A FISH AND YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN YOUR GLOB IN THE MORNING YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT IN THE AFTERNOON
SusanShaw_2010X@536.53:543.75 THEY'VE GOT YOUR NUMBER SO FROM A TOXICOLOGY PERSPECTIVE THIS IS REALLY AWFUL BECAUSE
SusanShaw_2010X@545.09:553.85 AND THE DISPERSED OIL ARE MUCH MORE TOXIC TOGETHER THAN EITHER ALONE AND USUALLY THE EXPOSURE IS A COMBINED EXPOSURE
SusanShaw_2010X@555.29:567.47 DISPERSANTS AS I WAS SAYING THEIR JOB IS TO BREAK DOWN THE LIPID MEMBRANE THE SOLVENTS IN THEM DO THAT VERY EFFICIENTLY SO THEY BREAK DOWN LIPID MEMBRANES
SusanShaw_2010X@567.89:578.53 IN OUR BODY STARTING WITH CELLS OF THE SKIN THE CELLS OF ORGANS SO IT ACTUALLY HASTENS OIL GETTING INTO THE BODY EASILY AND READILY
SusanShaw_2010X@579.17:585.83 OIL CONTAINS HUNDREDS OF HYDROCARBON COMPOUNDS AND OTHER COMPOUNDS THAT ARE TOXIC TO EVERY ORGAN IN THE BODY
SusanShaw_2010X@586.78:592.52 WITH THE DISPERSANTS COMBINED YOU HAVE THIS VERY SYNERGISTIC COMBINED TOXICITY
SusanShaw_2010X@604.45:613.20 AND CHEMISTS THAT ARE YOU KNOW BASICALLY TURNING CARTWHEELS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S IN THIS STUFF AND WHAT IS IT DOING AND WHAT ARE THE INTERACTIONS
SusanShaw_2010X@613.59:620.73 OF THESE CHEMICALS MOST OF WHICH WE DON'T KNOW AND WHAT ARE THEIR BYPRODUCTS WHICH ARE USUALLY MORE TOXIC THAN THE PARENT COMPOUND
SusanShaw_2010X@621.46:632.39 SO WE DID FIND THAT COREXIT NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CONTAINS HEAVY METALS ARSENIC AND CHROMIUM ARSENIC AT HIGH ENOUGH LEVELS TO HAVE CANCER CAUSING EFFECTS
SusanShaw_2010X@634.18:640.79 SO THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THESE YOU KNOW RIDICULOUS SAFETY DATA SHEETS WHICH HAVE NOTHING ON THEM
SusanShaw_2010X@641.45:647.27 MUCH AND NOW THEY WERE FORCED TO RELEASE THE ULTIMATE LIST OF EVERYTHING THAT'S IN
SusanShaw_2010X@648.90:658.64 AND GUESS WHAT TONS OF STUFF IS MISSING DERIVATIVES DERIVATIVES THESE ARE WHOLE BIG GROUPS OF MANY MANY COMPOUNDS THESE SORBITANS
SusanShaw_2010X@658.96:666.25 AND THEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE PETROLEUM DISTILLATES WHICH ARE THE SOLVENTS HUNDREDS OF THEM THEY ARE NOT IDENTIFIED AND WHY
SusanShaw_2010X@667.46:670.44 TRADE SECRETS AGAIN BP 'S RUNNING THE SHOW
SusanShaw_2010X@671.40:679.44 AND THE NALCO COMPANY THIS IS ALL THEY HAVE TO DO SO FAR THESE INGREDIENTS HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED AND TOXICOLOGISTS ARE ACTUALLY GOING
SusanShaw_2010X@680.11:685.91 BECAUSE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY WHAT THE INTERACTIONS AND TOXIC
SusanShaw_2010X@701.16:714.16 AND THEN PART OF THIS IS JUST PART OF MY BAD DREAMS AND I APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO VENT SOME OF MY ANGUISH UPON YOU WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE CORALS ARE GOING TO GET HIT HARD
SusanShaw_2010X@714.99:723.20 AND THIS IS A STUDY THAT WAS DONE ON THE AUSTRALIAN COAST THE COAST OF TASMANIA CORALS ARE YOU KNOW THE HOME TO
SusanShaw_2010X@723.46:732.95 ABOUT A QUARTER OF ALL MARINE SPECIES AND WITH THE COREXIT AND THE OIL THERE'S ZERO PERCENT FERTILIZATION
SusanShaw_2010X@733.68:742.14 WITH OIL ALONE THERE'S NINETY EIGHT PERCENT FERTILIZATION SO THEY'RE A VERY SENSITIVE SPECIES TO THIS COMBO HERE 'S ANOTHER GROUP
SusanShaw_2010X@742.41:749.59 I COULD SEE MYSELF EASILY IN THE WATER COLUMN THE PLANKTON AND THE PLANKTON EATERS YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE LITTLE HERRING FISH THAT
SusanShaw_2010X@749.81:758.95 GO THROUGH THE WATER COLUMN WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN FEEDING INDISCRIMINATELY AND JUST LAPPING UP THIS BROWN PUDDING OF TOXIC STUFF
SusanShaw_2010X@760.30:768.08 AND WE DO KNOW FROM OTHER STUDIES THAT THIS IS A HIGHLY TOXIC MIXTURE SEE THE OIL AND COREXIT IS CAUSING DEATH AT
SusanShaw_2010X@768.83:778.77 A MUCH MUCH LOWER DOSE THAN OIL ALONE THAT'S PROBABLY AS FAR AS WHAT WE DO KNOW ABOUT TOXIC EFFECTS BUT MY BAD DREAMS GO LIKE THIS
SusanShaw_2010X@779.75:788.33 THE PISCIVOROUS FISH THE COBIA GROUPER AMBERJACKS THOSE BIG FISH ALSO THE TUNA AND SHARKS ARE GOING TO HIT BY THIS AND
SusanShaw_2010X@788.61:797.30 THE GILLS ARE QUITE SENSITIVE THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM IS VERY SENSITIVE THINK ABOUT IT WITH THE COREXIT HITTING THE MEMBRANES
SusanShaw_2010X@797.74:806.24 AND IT WILL CLOG UP THE GILLS AND THEN THESE ANIMALS ARE GOING TO BE GETTING SOMETHING LIKE WHAT YOU CALL CHEMICAL PNEUMONIA
SusanShaw_2010X@806.88:817.35 TRYING TO ASPIRATE THE COMPOUNDS IT ALSO WILL CAUSE INTERNAL BLEEDING UPON INGESTION I'M VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE AIR BREATHING MAMMALS BECAUSE I STUDY THEM BUT ALSO
SusanShaw_2010X@817.72:827.22 THE WAY THEIR GOING TO BE EXPOSED IS EVERY TIME THEY COME TO THE SURFACE TO TAKE A BREATH THEY'RE GOING TO INHALE THESE VOLATILE FUMES AND WHAT DOES HAPPEN WITH THAT EVENTUALLY IS
SusanShaw_2010X@842.90:856.41 A LOT OF DIFFERENT UNPLEASANT EFFECTS BUT BURNS TO THE EYES AND MOUTH SKIN ULCERS LESIONS AND I THINK PERSONALLY THAT WE HAVE NOT BEGUN TO SEE THE IMPACTS OF THIS SPILL ON THE WILDLIFE
SusanShaw_2010X@857.72:869.52 WE STARTED HYPOTHESIZING WHAT DO WE KNOW WHAT DO WITH THINK WOULD BE A TROPHIC CASCADE WHICH MEANS THAT SOMEBODY GETS WIPED OUT AND THEN EVERYTHING ABOVE THAT'S EATING THOSE GUYS WILL CRASH
SusanShaw_2010X@870.26:878.90 SO OUR THOUGHT WAS THIS IS A SIMPLE THINKING PROCESS BUT OBVIOUSLY THE PLANKTON THE PLANKTIVORES AND THAT'S ABOUT AS FAR AS WE GOT
SusanShaw_2010X@889.17:897.12 THE HERRING AND OTHER FISHES AND GOING UP THEY THOUGHT THAT EVENTUALLY THE KILLER WHALE WOULD BE AT THE TOP OF THIS CASCADE AND THEN HERE 'S WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
SusanShaw_2010X@897.56:905.44 MUCH MORE COMPLICATED MUCH MORE SPECIFIC ACTUALLY THE KELP AND THE BARNACLES THAT ATTACH TO THE ROCK WERE
SusanShaw_2010X@918.15:931.22 STORMS CAME ALONG THEY RIPPED OUT OF THE ROCK AND THIS WAS THE ENTIRE FOOD WEB FOR THE SEA DUCKS AND AS YOU KNOW WE LOST ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SEA DUCKS FROM THE EXXON VALDEZ SPILL AND THEY HAVEN'T COME BACK
SusanShaw_2010X@932.47:943.72 SO WE ARE LAUNCHING AN INDEPENDENT STUDY AND BY INDEPENDENT I DO NOT MEAN ALONE I MEAN INDEPENDENT IN THE SENSE OF NOT TIED TO
SusanShaw_2010X@944.52:952.30 THE KIND OF CRIME SCENE SECRECY THAT'S GOING ON IN THE GULF NOW BUT WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ASSESSING TOXIC IMPACTS BUT WE NEED
SusanShaw_2010X@952.59:962.09 LOTS AND LOTS OF PARTNERS TO DO THIS INTELLIGENTLY WE HAVE SOME OF THE PARTNERS LINED UP AND DAVE GALLO SIGNED ON SYLVIA 'S IN HERE
SusanShaw_2010X@962.60:976.94 AND WE HOPE THAT SOME OF YOU WILL HELP US MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WHY SHOULDN 'T WE KNOW DON'T WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW SURELY WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO LEARN WHAT LOSS WE ARE GOING THROUGH IN THE GULF AND MY
SusanShaw_2010X@977.41:985.00 WISH WOULD BE FOR THE GULF PRIZE WOULD BE THAT WE HAVE THE TRUTH WHATEVER IT IS
SusanShaw_2010X@985.41:992.83 PLEASE LET US HAVE THE TRUTH AND TO GET THERE WE NEED TO DO THE ASSESSMENT SO I APPRECIATE BEING HERE THANK YOU
