KaryMullis_2009 FOUR YEARS AGO FIVE YEARS AGO I WAS SITTING ON A STAGE IN PHILADELPHIA I THINK IT WAS WITH A BAG SIMILAR TO THIS AND I WAS PULLING A MOLECULE
KaryMullis_2009 YOU DON'T KNOW THIS MOLECULE REALLY WELL BUT YOUR BODY KNOWS IT EXTREMELY WELL AND I WAS THINKING THAT YOUR BODY HATED IT
KaryMullis_2009 AT THE TIME BECAUSE WE ARE VERY IMMUNE TO THIS THIS IS CALLED ALPHA GAL EPITOPE AND THE FACT THAT PIG HEART VALVES HAVE LOTS OF THESE ON THEM IS THE REASON THAT YOU CAN'T TRANSPLANT A PIG HEART VALVE INTO A PERSON EASILY
KaryMullis_2009 ACTUALLY OUR BODY DOESN'T HATE THESE OUR BODY LOVES THESE IT EATS THEM I MEAN THE CELLS IN OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM
KaryMullis_2009 ARE ALWAYS HUNGRY AND IF AN ANTIBODY IS STUCK TO ONE OF THESE THINGS ON THE CELL IT MEANS THAT 'S FOOD
KaryMullis_2009 WE CAN'T GET RID OF IT BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO TRANSPLANT HEART VALVES FOUND OUT YOU CAN'T GET RID OF THAT IMMUNITY AND I SAID WHY DON'T YOU USE THAT
KaryMullis_2009 WHAT IF I COULD STICK THIS MOLECULE SLAP IT ONTO A BACTERIA THAT WAS PATHOGENIC TO ME THAT HAD JUST INVADED MY LUNGS I MEAN I COULD IMMEDIATELY
KaryMullis_2009 FOR A TRAFFIC TICKET IN L A AND THE COP DROPS A BAG OF MARIJUANA IN THE BACK OF YOUR CAR AND THEN CHARGES YOU FOR POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA
KaryMullis_2009 IT'S LIKE THIS VERY FAST VERY EFFICIENT WAY TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET
KaryMullis_2009 REALLY DOESN'T MAKE THESE THINGS AT ALL AND IF YOU COULD CLAMP THESE ON IT REALLY WELL YOU HAVE IT TAKEN OFF THE STREET AND FOR CERTAIN BACTERIA WE DON'T
KaryMullis_2009 REALLY EFFICIENT WAYS TO DO THAT ANYMORE OUR ANTIBIOTICS ARE RUNNING OUT AND I MEAN THE WORLD APPARENTLY IS RUNNING OUT TOO SO PROBABLY IT DOESN'T MATTER FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW STREPTOCOCCUS AND STUFF LIKE THAT WILL BE RAMPANT BECAUSE WE WON 'T BE HERE
KaryMullis_2009 BUT IF WE ARE WE'RE GOING TO NEED SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE BACTERIA SO I STARTED
KaryMullis_2009 THEMSELVES ATTACHED TO CERTAIN SPECIFIC TARGET ZONES BACTERIA THAT WE DON'T LIKE AND I FEEL NOW LIKE
KaryMullis_2009 GEORGE BUSH IT'S LIKE MISSION ACCOMPLISHED SO I MIGHT BE DOING SOMETHING DUMB JUST LIKE HE WAS DOING AT THE TIME BUT BASICALLY WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT THERE WE'VE NOW GOTTEN TO WORK AND IT'S KILLING BACTERIA
KaryMullis_2009 THIS THING CAN BE STUCK LIKE THAT LITTLE GREEN TRIANGLE UP THERE SORT OF SYMBOLIZING THIS RIGHT NOW YOU CAN STICK THIS TO SOMETHING CALLED A DNA APTAMER
KaryMullis_2009 AND THAT DNA APTAMER WILL ATTACH SPECIFICALLY TO A TARGET THAT YOU HAVE SELECTED FOR IT SO YOU CAN FIND A LITTLE FEATURE ON A BACTERIUM THAT YOU DON'T
KaryMullis_2009 WHEN IT'S IN YOUR BODY AND WILL ALERT YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM TO GO AFTER IT HERE 'S WHAT HAPPENED SEE THAT LINE ON THE VERY TOP WITH THE LITTLE DOTS
KaryMullis_2009 THAT'S A BUNCH OF MICE THAT HAD BEEN POISONED BY OUR SCIENTIST FRIENDS DOWN IN TEXAS AT BROOKS AIR BASE WITH ANTHRAX AND THEY HAD ALSO BEEN TREATED
KaryMullis_2009 WITH A DRUG THAT WE MADE THAT WOULD ATTACK ANTHRAX IN PARTICULAR AND DIRECT YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM TO IT
KaryMullis_2009 THEY ALL LIVED THE ONES ON THE TOP LINE THAT'S A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SURVIVAL RATE AND THEY ACTUALLY LIVED ANOTHER FOURTEEN DAYS OR TWENTY EIGHT WHEN WE FINALLY KILLED THEM AND
KaryMullis_2009 OUT WHAT WENT WRONG WHY DID THEY NOT DIE AND THEY DIDN'T DIE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE
