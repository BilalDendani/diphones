MartinHanczyc_2011S@16.11:32.57 HISTORICALLY THERE HAS BEEN A HUGE DIVIDE BETWEEN WHAT PEOPLE CONSIDER TO BE NON LIVING SYSTEMS ON ONE SIDE AND LIVING SYSTEMS ON THE OTHER SIDE SO WE GO FROM SAY THIS BEAUTIFUL AND COMPLEX CRYSTAL AS NON LIFE AND THIS RATHER BEAUTIFUL AND COMPLEX CAT
MartinHanczyc_2011S@32.58:46.93 ON THE OTHER SIDE OVER THE LAST HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS OR SO SCIENCE HAS KIND OF BLURRED THIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN NON LIVING AND LIVING SYSTEMS AND NOW WE CONSIDER THAT THERE MAY BE A KIND OF CONTINUUM THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE TWO WE 'LL JUST TAKE ONE EXAMPLE HERE
MartinHanczyc_2011S@61.76:71.03 BUT WHAT WE 'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HERE TONIGHT ARE EXPERIMENTS DONE ON THIS SORT OF NON LIVING END OF THIS SPECTRUM SO ACTUALLY DOING CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS IN THE LABORATORY
MartinHanczyc_2011S@71.03:83.2 MIXING TOGETHER NONLIVING INGREDIENTS TO MAKE NEW STRUCTURES AND THAT THESE NEW STRUCTURES MIGHT HAVE SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF LIVING SYSTEMS REALLY WHAT I 'M TALKING ABOUT HERE IS TRYING TO CREATE A KIND OF ARTIFICIAL LIFE
MartinHanczyc_2011S@83.2:97.93 SO WHAT ARE THESE CHARACTERISTICS THAT I 'M TALKING ABOUT THESE ARE THEM WE CONSIDER FIRST THAT LIFE HAS A BODY NOW THIS IS NECESSARY TO DISTINGUISH THE SELF FROM THE ENVIRONMENT LIFE ALSO HAS A METABOLISM NOW THIS IS A PROCESS BY WHICH LIFE CAN CONVERT
MartinHanczyc_2011S@97.93:102.74 RESOURCES FROM THE ENVIRONMENT INTO BUILDING BLOCKS SO IT CAN MAINTAIN AND BUILD ITSELF
MartinHanczyc_2011S@102.74:112.1 LIFE ALSO HAS A KIND OF INHERITABLE INFORMATION NOW WE AS HUMANS WE STORE OUR INFORMATION AS DNA IN OUR GENOMES AND WE PASS THIS INFORMATION ON TO OUR OFFSPRING
MartinHanczyc_2011S@112.1:132.01 IF WE COUPLE THE FIRST TWO THE BODY AND THE METABOLISM WE CAN COME UP WITH A SYSTEM THAT COULD PERHAPS MOVE AND REPLICATE AND IF WE COUPLED THESE NOW TO INHERITABLE INFORMATION WE CAN COME UP WITH A SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE MORE LIFELIKE AND WOULD PERHAPS EVOLVE AND SO THESE ARE THE THINGS WE WILL TRY TO DO IN THE LAB MAKE SOME EXPERIMENTS THAT HAVE ONE OR MORE OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS OF LIFE
MartinHanczyc_2011S@132.01:139.67 SO HOW DO WE DO THIS WELL WE USE A MODEL SYSTEM THAT WE TERM A PROTOCELL YOU MIGHT THINK OF THIS AS KIND OF LIKE A PRIMITIVE CELL
MartinHanczyc_2011S@139.67:154.1 IT IS A SIMPLE CHEMICAL MODEL OF A LIVING CELL AND IF YOU CONSIDER FOR EXAMPLE A CELL IN YOUR BODY MAY HAVE ON THE ORDER OF MILLIONS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOLECULES THAT NEED TO COME TOGETHER PLAY TOGETHER IN A COMPLEX NETWORK TO PRODUCE SOMETHING THAT WE CALL ALIVE
MartinHanczyc_2011S@154.1:164.44 IN THE LABORATORY WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MUCH THE SAME BUT WITH ON THE ORDER OF TENS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOLECULES SO A DRASTIC REDUCTION IN COMPLEXITY BUT STILL TRYING TO PRODUCE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIFELIKE
MartinHanczyc_2011S@164.44:173.35 AND SO WHAT WE DO IS WE START SIMPLE AND WE WORK OUR WAY UP TO LIVING SYSTEMS CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT THIS QUOTE BY LEDUC A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
MartinHanczyc_2011S@173.6:187.21 CONSIDERING A KIND OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY THE SYNTHESIS OF LIFE SHOULD IT EVER OCCUR WILL NOT BE THE SENSATIONAL DISCOVERY WHICH WE USUALLY ASSOCIATE WITH THE IDEA THAT 'S HIS FIRST STATEMENT SO IF WE ACTUALLY CREATE LIFE IN THE LABORATORIES IT 'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO IMPACT OUR LIVES AT ALL
MartinHanczyc_2011S@187.21:203.94 IF WE ACCEPT THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION THEN THE FIRST DAWN OF SYNTHESIS OF LIFE MUST CONSIST IN THE PRODUCTION OF FORMS INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN THE INORGANIC AND THE ORGANIC WORLD OR BETWEEN THE NON LIVING AND LIVING WORLD FORMS WHICH POSSESS ONLY SOME OF THE RUDIMENTARY ATTRIBUTES OF LIFE SO THE ONES I JUST DISCUSSED
MartinHanczyc_2011S@217.48:226.39 THIS IS HOW WE CAN START TO MAKE A PROTOCELL WE USE THIS IDEA CALLED SELF ASSEMBLY WHAT THAT MEANS IS I CAN MIX SOME CHEMICALS TOGETHER IN A TEST TUBE IN MY LAB
MartinHanczyc_2011S@226.39:238.28 AND THESE CHEMICALS WILL START TO SELF ASSOCIATE TO FORM LARGER AND LARGER STRUCTURES SO SAY ON THE ORDER OF TENS OF THOUSANDS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MOLECULES WILL COME TOGETHER TO FORM A LARGE STRUCTURE THAT DIDN 'T EXIST BEFORE
MartinHanczyc_2011S@238.28:257.62 AND IN THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE WHAT I TOOK IS SOME MEMBRANE MOLECULES MIXED THOSE TOGETHER IN THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT AND WITHIN SECONDS IT FORMS THESE RATHER COMPLEX AND BEAUTIFUL STRUCTURES HERE THESE MEMBRANES ARE ALSO QUITE SIMILAR MORPHOLOGICALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY TO THE MEMBRANES IN YOUR BODY AND WE CAN USE THESE AS THEY SAY TO FORM THE BODY OF OUR PROTOCELL
MartinHanczyc_2011S@257.81:274.4 LIKEWISE WE CAN WORK WITH OIL AND WATER SYSTEMS AS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU PUT OIL AND WATER TOGETHER THEY DON 'T MIX BUT THROUGH SELF ASSEMBLY WE CAN GET A NICE OIL DROPLET TO FORM AND WE CAN ACTUALLY USE THIS AS A BODY FOR OUR ARTIFICIAL ORGANISM OR FOR OUR PROTOCELL AS YOU WILL SEE LATER SO THAT 'S JUST FORMING SOME
MartinHanczyc_2011S@274.47:293.34 BODY STUFF RIGHT SOME ARCHITECTURES WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER ASPECTS OF LIVING SYSTEMS SO WE CAME UP WITH THIS PROTOCELL MODEL HERE THAT I 'M SHOWING WE STARTED WITH A NATURAL OCCURRING CLAY CALLED MONTMORILLONITE THIS IS NATURAL FROM THE ENVIRONMENT THIS CLAY IT FORMS A SURFACE THAT IS SAY CHEMICALLY ACTIVE IT COULD RUN A METABOLISM ON IT
MartinHanczyc_2011S@293.34:305.02 CERTAIN KIND OF MOLECULES LIKE TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE CLAY FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS CASE RNA SHOWN IN RED THIS IS A RELATIVE OF DNA IT 'S AN INFORMATIONAL MOLECULE IT CAN COME ALONG AND IT STARTS TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE SURFACE OF THIS CLAY
MartinHanczyc_2011S@305.02:321.17 THIS STRUCTURE THEN CAN ORGANIZE THE FORMATION OF A MEMBRANE BOUNDARY AROUND ITSELF SO IT CAN MAKE A BODY OF LIQUID MOLECULES AROUND ITSELF AND THAT 'S SHOWN IN GREEN HERE ON THIS MICROGRAPH SO JUST THROUGH SELF ASSEMBLY MIXING THINGS TOGETHER IN THE LAB WE CAN COME UP WITH SAY A METABOLIC SURFACE
MartinHanczyc_2011S@321.17:323.36 WITH SOME INFORMATIONAL MOLECULES ATTACHED
MartinHanczyc_2011S@323.36:330.27 INSIDE OF THIS MEMBRANE BODY RIGHT SO WE 'RE ON A ROAD TOWARDS LIVING SYSTEMS
MartinHanczyc_2011S@330.27:336.33 BUT IF YOU SAW THIS PROTOCELL YOU WOULD NOT CONFUSE THIS WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS ACTUALLY ALIVE IT 'S ACTUALLY QUITE LIFELESS
MartinHanczyc_2011S@336.33:341.58 ONCE IT FORMS IT DOESN 'T REALLY DO ANYTHING SO SOMETHING IS MISSING SOME THINGS ARE MISSING
MartinHanczyc_2011S@341.58:353.65 SO SOME THINGS THAT ARE MISSING IS FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAD A FLOW OF ENERGY THROUGH A SYSTEM WHAT WE 'D WANT IS A PROTOCELL THAT CAN HARVEST SOME OF THAT ENERGY IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ITSELF MUCH LIKE LIVING SYSTEMS DO
MartinHanczyc_2011S@353.65:368.58 SO WE CAME UP WITH A DIFFERENT PROTOCELL MODEL AND THIS IS ACTUALLY SIMPLER THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE IN THIS PROTOCELL MODEL IT 'S JUST AN OIL DROPLET BUT A CHEMICAL METABOLISM INSIDE THAT ALLOWS THIS PROTOCELL TO USE ENERGY TO DO SOMETHING TO ACTUALLY BECOME DYNAMIC AS WE 'LL SEE HERE
MartinHanczyc_2011S@388.34:400.18 IT IS MOVING AROUND EXPLORING ITS ENVIRONMENT AND REMODELING ITS ENVIRONMENT AS YOU SEE BY THESE CHEMICAL WAVES THAT ARE FORMING BY THE PROTOCELL SO IT 'S ACTING IN A SENSE LIKE A LIVING SYSTEM TRYING TO PRESERVE ITSELF
MartinHanczyc_2011S@400.18:411.15 WE TAKE THIS SAME MOVING PROTOCELL HERE AND WE PUT IT IN ANOTHER EXPERIMENT GET IT MOVING THEN I 'M GOING TO ADD SOME FOOD TO THE SYSTEM AND YOU 'LL SEE THAT IN BLUE HERE
MartinHanczyc_2011S@411.15:422.24 RIGHT SO I ADD SOME FOOD SOURCE TO THE SYSTEM THE PROTOCELL MOVES IT ENCOUNTERS THE FOOD IT RECONFIGURES ITSELF AND ACTUALLY THEN IS ABLE TO CLIMB TO THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF FOOD IN THAT SYSTEM AND STOP THERE
MartinHanczyc_2011S@425.23:443.45 THAT HAS A BODY IT HAS A METABOLISM IT CAN USE ENERGY IT MOVES AROUND IT CAN SENSE ITS LOCAL ENVIRONMENT AND ACTUALLY FIND RESOURCES IN THE ENVIRONMENT TO SUSTAIN ITSELF NOW THIS DOESN 'T HAVE A BRAIN IT DOESN 'T HAVE A NEURAL SYSTEM THIS IS JUST A SACK OF CHEMICALS THAT IS ABLE TO HAVE THIS INTERESTING AND COMPLEX LIFELIKE BEHAVIOR
MartinHanczyc_2011S@443.45:450.68 IF WE COUNT THE NUMBER OF CHEMICALS IN THAT SYSTEM ACTUALLY INCLUDING THE WATER THAT 'S IN THE DISH WE HAVE FIVE CHEMICALS THAT CAN DO THIS
MartinHanczyc_2011S@450.68:462.67 SO THEN WE PUT THESE PROTOCELLS TOGETHER IN A SINGLE EXPERIMENT TO SEE WHAT THEY WOULD DO AND DEPENDING ON THE CONDITIONS WE HAVE SOME PROTOCELLS ON THE LEFT THAT ARE MOVING AROUND AND IT LIKES TO TOUCH THE OTHER STRUCTURES IN ITS ENVIRONMENT
MartinHanczyc_2011S@462.71:481.01 ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE TWO MOVING PROTOCELLS THAT LIKE TO CIRCLE EACH OTHER AND THEY FORM A KIND OF A DANCE A COMPLEX DANCE WITH EACH OTHER RIGHT SO NOT ONLY DO INDIVIDUAL PROTOCELLS HAVE BEHAVIOR WHAT WE 'VE INTERPRETED AS BEHAVIOR IN THIS SYSTEM BUT WE ALSO HAVE BASICALLY POPULATION LEVEL BEHAVIOR SIMILAR TO WHAT ORGANISMS HAVE
MartinHanczyc_2011S@481.01:484.88 SO NOW THAT YOU 'RE ALL EXPERTS ON PROTOCELLS
MartinHanczyc_2011S@484.88:489.07 WE 'RE GOING TO PLAY A GAME WITH THESE PROTOCELLS WE 'RE GOING TO MAKE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS
MartinHanczyc_2011S@511.03:514.01 SO THERE 'S POPULATION
MartinHanczyc_2011S@532.56:537.27 SO THEN I REPEATED THIS EXPERIMENT A BUNCH OF TIMES AND ONE TIME SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING HAPPENED
MartinHanczyc_2011S@537.27:549.25 SO I ADDED THESE PROTOCELLS TOGETHER TO THE SYSTEM AND PROTOCELL A AND PROTOCELL B FUSED TOGETHER TO FORM A HYBRID PROTOCELL AB THAT DIDN 'T HAPPEN BEFORE THERE IT GOES THERE 'S A PROTOCELL AB NOW IN THIS SYSTEM
MartinHanczyc_2011S@562.54:565.32 NOW WE HAVE A DANCING PROTOCELL
MartinHanczyc_2011S@586.06:592.81 SO SINCE WE CAN MAKE SOME INTERESTING PROTOCELLS THAT WE LIKE INTERESTING COLORS AND INTERESTING BEHAVIORS
MartinHanczyc_2011S@592.81:607.14 AND THEY 'RE VERY EASY TO MAKE AND THEY HAVE INTERESTING LIFELIKE PROPERTIES PERHAPS THESE PROTOCELLS HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL US ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LIFE ON THE EARTH PERHAPS THESE REPRESENT AN EASILY ACCESSIBLE STEP ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS BY WHICH LIFE GOT STARTED ON THE EARLY EARTH
MartinHanczyc_2011S@607.14:610.87 CERTAINLY THERE WERE MOLECULES PRESENT ON THE EARLY EARTH
MartinHanczyc_2011S@610.87:618.66 BUT THEY WOULDN 'T HAVE BEEN THESE PURE COMPOUNDS THAT WE WORKED WITH IN THE LAB AND I SHOWED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS RATHER THEY 'D BE A REAL COMPLEX MIXTURE OF ALL KINDS OF STUFF
MartinHanczyc_2011S@618.66:635.98 BECAUSE UNCONTROLLED CHEMICAL REACTIONS PRODUCE A DIVERSE MIXTURE OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS THINK OF IT LIKE A PRIMORDIAL OOZE OKAY AND IT 'S A POOL THAT 'S TOO DIFFICULT TO FULLY CHARACTERIZE EVEN BY MODERN METHODS AND THE PRODUCT LOOKS BROWN LIKE THIS TAR HERE ON THE LEFT A PURE COMPOUND IS SHOWN ON THE RIGHT FOR CONTRAST
MartinHanczyc_2011S@635.98:648.27 SO THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TAKE PURE SUGAR CRYSTALS IN YOUR KITCHEN YOU PUT THEM IN A PAN AND YOU APPLY ENERGY YOU TURN UP THE HEAT YOU START MAKING OR BREAKING CHEMICAL BONDS IN THE SUGAR FORMING A BROWNISH CARAMEL RIGHT
MartinHanczyc_2011S@648.27:659.44 IF YOU LET THAT GO UNREGULATED YOU 'LL CONTINUE TO MAKE AND BREAK CHEMICAL BONDS FORMING AN EVEN MORE DIVERSE MIXTURE OF MOLECULES THAT THEN FORMS THIS KIND OF BLACK TARRY STUFF IN YOUR PAN RIGHT THAT 'S DIFFICULT TO WASH OUT
MartinHanczyc_2011S@659.44:668.75 SO THAT 'S WHAT THE ORIGIN OF LIFE WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE YOU NEEDED TO GET LIFE OUT OF THIS JUNK THAT IS PRESENT ON THE EARLY EARTH FOUR FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION YEARS AGO
MartinHanczyc_2011S@668.75:675.38 SO THE CHALLENGE THEN IS THROW AWAY ALL YOUR PURE CHEMICALS IN THE LAB AND TRY TO MAKE SOME PROTOCELLS WITH LIFELIKE PROPERTIES
MartinHanczyc_2011S@675.38:693.53 FROM THIS KIND OF PRIMORDIAL OOZE SO WE 'RE ABLE TO THEN SEE THE SELF ASSEMBLY OF THESE OIL DROPLET BODIES AGAIN THAT WE 'VE SEEN PREVIOUSLY AND THE BLACK SPOTS INSIDE OF THERE REPRESENT THIS KIND OF BLACK TAR THIS DIVERSE VERY COMPLEX ORGANIC BLACK TAR AND WE PUT THEM INTO ONE OF THESE EXPERIMENTS AS YOU 'VE SEEN EARLIER AND THEN WE WATCH
MartinHanczyc_2011S@693.53:705.83 LIVELY MOVEMENT THAT COMES OUT THEY LOOK REALLY GOOD VERY NICE MOVEMENT AND ALSO THEY APPEAR TO HAVE SOME KIND OF BEHAVIOR WHERE THEY KIND OF CIRCLE AROUND EACH OTHER AND FOLLOW EACH OTHER SIMILAR TO WHAT WE 'VE SEEN BEFORE BUT AGAIN
MartinHanczyc_2011S@705.87:709.76 WORKING WITH JUST PRIMORDIAL CONDITIONS NO PURE CHEMICALS
MartinHanczyc_2011S@709.76:719.93 THESE ARE ALSO THESE TAR FUELED PROTOCELLS ARE ALSO ABLE TO LOCATE RESOURCES IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT I 'M GOING TO ADD SOME RESOURCE FROM THE LEFT HERE THAT DEFUSES INTO THE SYSTEM AND YOU CAN SEE
MartinHanczyc_2011S@719.93:732.69 THEY REALLY LIKE THAT THEY BECOME VERY ENERGETIC AND ABLE TO FIND THE RESOURCE IN THE ENVIRONMENT SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW BEFORE BUT AGAIN THESE ARE DONE IN THESE PRIMORDIAL CONDITIONS REALLY MESSY CONDITIONS NOT SORT OF STERILE LABORATORY CONDITIONS
MartinHanczyc_2011S@732.69:743.81 THESE ARE VERY DIRTY LITTLE PROTOCELLS AS A MATTER OF FACT LAUGHTER BUT THEY HAVE LIFELIKE PROPERTIES IS THE POINT SO DOING THESE ARTIFICIAL LIFE EXPERIMENTS
MartinHanczyc_2011S@744.08:751.04 HELPS US DEFINE A POTENTIAL PATH BETWEEN NON LIVING AND LIVING SYSTEMS AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT IT HELPS US
MartinHanczyc_2011S@751.04:764.17 BROADEN OUR VIEW OF WHAT LIFE IS AND WHAT POSSIBLE LIFE THERE COULD BE OUT THERE LIFE THAT COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM LIFE THAT WE FIND HERE ON EARTH AND THAT LEADS ME TO THE NEXT TERM WHICH IS WEIRD LIFE
MartinHanczyc_2011S@764.52:774.35 THIS IS A TERM BY STEVE BENNER THIS IS USED IN REFERENCE TO A REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN BY THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL IN THE UNITED STATES WHEREIN THEY TRIED TO UNDERSTAND
MartinHanczyc_2011S@774.35:785.63 HOW WE CAN LOOK FOR LIFE ELSEWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE OKAY ESPECIALLY IF THAT LIFE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM LIFE ON EARTH IF WE WENT TO ANOTHER PLANET AND WE THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE LIFE THERE HOW COULD WE EVEN RECOGNIZE IT AS LIFE
MartinHanczyc_2011S@785.63:802.5 WELL THEY CAME UP WITH THREE VERY GENERAL CRITERIA FIRST IS AND THEY 'RE LISTED HERE THE FIRST IS THE SYSTEM HAS TO BE IN NON EQUILIBRIUM THAT MEANS THE SYSTEM CANNOT BE DEAD IN A MATTER OF FACT BASICALLY WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU HAVE AN INPUT OF ENERGY INTO THE SYSTEM THAT LIFE CAN USE AND EXPLOIT TO MAINTAIN ITSELF
MartinHanczyc_2011S@802.5:811.33 THIS IS SIMILAR TO HAVING THE SUN SHINING ON THE EARTH DRIVING PHOTOSYNTHESIS DRIVING THE ECOSYSTEM WITHOUT THE SUN THERE 'S LIKELY TO BE NO LIFE ON THIS PLANET
MartinHanczyc_2011S@811.33:831.2 SECONDLY LIFE NEEDS TO BE IN LIQUID FORM SO THAT MEANS EVEN IF WE HAD SOME INTERESTING STRUCTURES INTERESTING MOLECULES TOGETHER BUT THEY WERE FROZEN SOLID THEN THIS IS NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR LIFE AND THIRDLY WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE AND BREAK CHEMICAL BONDS AND AGAIN THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE LIFE TRANSFORMS RESOURCES FROM THE ENVIRONMENT INTO BUILDING BLOCKS SO IT CAN MAINTAIN ITSELF
MartinHanczyc_2011S@831.2:839.66 NOW TODAY I TOLD YOU ABOUT VERY STRANGE AND WEIRD PROTOCELLS SOME THAT CONTAIN CLAY SOME THAT HAVE PRIMORDIAL OOZE IN THEM
MartinHanczyc_2011S@839.7:847.39 SOME THAT HAVE BASICALLY OIL INSTEAD OF WATER INSIDE OF THEM MOST OF THESE DON 'T CONTAIN DNA BUT YET THEY HAVE LIFELIKE PROPERTIES
MartinHanczyc_2011S@847.39:867.22 BUT THESE PROTOCELLS SATISFY THESE GENERAL REQUIREMENTS OF LIVING SYSTEMS SO BY MAKING THESE CHEMICAL ARTIFICIAL LIFE EXPERIMENTS WE HOPE NOT ONLY TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LIFE AND THE EXISTENCE OF LIFE ON THIS PLANET BUT ALSO WHAT POSSIBLE LIFE THERE COULD BE OUT THERE IN THE UNIVERSE THANK YOU
