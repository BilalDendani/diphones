911Mothers_2010W TODAY BECAUSE OF
911Mothers_2010W I FIRST LEARNED THAT MY SON HAD BEEN IN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER ON THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH TWO THOUSAND AND ONE
911Mothers_2010W WE DIDN 'T KNOW IF HE HAD PERISHED YET UNTIL THIRTY SIX HOURS LATER AT THE TIME
911Mothers_2010W WE KNEW THAT IT WAS POLITICAL
911Mothers_2010W WE WERE AFRAID OF WHAT OUR COUNTRY WAS GOING TO DO IN THE NAME OF OUR SON MY HUSBAND ORLANDO AND I
911Mothers_2010W AND OUR FAMILY AND WHEN I SAW IT AND YET THROUGH THE SHOCK
911Mothers_2010W THE TERRIBLE SHOCK AND THE TERRIBLE
911Mothers_2010W EXPLOSION IN OUR LIVES LITERALLY
911Mothers_2010W WE WERE NOT VENGEFUL
911Mothers_2010W ON SIX COUNTS OF CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT TERRORISM
911Mothers_2010W AND THE U S GOVERNMENT CALLED FOR A DEATH PENALTY FOR HIM IF CONVICTED
911Mothers_2010W MY HUSBAND AND I SPOKE OUT
911Mothers_2010W IN OPPOSITION TO THAT PUBLICLY THROUGH THAT AND THROUGH HUMAN RIGHTS
911Mothers_2010W GROUPS WE WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL OTHER VICTIMS FAMILIES WHEN I SAW AICHA IN THE MEDIA
911Mothers_2010W COMING OVER WHEN HER SON WAS INDICTED AND I THOUGHT WHAT A BRAVE WOMAN SOMEDAY I WANT TO MEET THAT WOMAN WHEN I 'M STRONGER I WAS STILL IN DEEP GRIEF I KNEW I DIDN 'T HAVE THE STRENGTH I KNEW I WOULD FIND HER SOMEDAY OR WE WOULD FIND EACH OTHER BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE HEARD THAT MY SON
911Mothers_2010W WAS A VICTIM I GOT IMMEDIATE SYMPATHY
911Mothers_2010W BUT WHEN PEOPLE LEARNED WHAT HER SON WAS ACCUSED OF SHE DIDN 'T GET THAT SYMPATHY BUT HER SUFFERING IS EQUAL TO MINE SO WE MET IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND TWO AND AICHA WILL NOW TELL YOU HOW THAT CAME ABOUT
911Mothers_2010W INTRODUCED ME TO FIVE FAMILIES AND I SAW PHYLLIS AND I WATCHED
911Mothers_2010W AND I SAW IN HER EYES THAT SHE WAS A MOTHER JUST LIKE ME
911Mothers_2010W I WAS MARRIED WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN I LOST A CHILD WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN A SECOND CHILD WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN SO THE STORY WITH ZACARIAS WAS TOO MUCH REALLY
911Mothers_2010W SO THAT 'S WHY I DECIDED TO TELL MY STORY SO THAT MY SUFFERING IS SOMETHING POSITIVE FOR OTHER WOMEN
911Mothers_2010W ALL THE WOMEN ALL THE MOTHERS
911Mothers_2010W IT 'S UP TO US WOMEN BECAUSE WE ARE WOMEN BECAUSE WE LOVE OUR CHILDREN
911Mothers_2010W IT 'S NOT AGAINST WOMEN IT 'S FOR US FOR US WOMEN FOR
911Mothers_2010W I TALK AGAINST VIOLENCE AGAINST TERRORISM I GO TO SCHOOLS TO TALK TO YOUNG MUSLIM
911Mothers_2010W GIRLS SO THEY DON 'T ACCEPT TO BE MARRIED AGAINST THEIR WILL VERY YOUNG
911Mothers_2010W SO IF I CAN SAVE ONE OF THE YOUNG GIRLS AND AVOID THAT THEY GET MARRIED AND SUFFER AS MUCH AS I DID WELL THIS IS SOMETHING
911Mothers_2010W I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH
911Mothers_2010W FAMILY MEMBERS BUT WE WERE ALL SO NERVOUS WHY DOES SHE WANT TO MEET US
911Mothers_2010W AND THEN SHE WAS NERVOUS WHY DID WE WANT TO MEET HER WHAT DID WE WANT FROM EACH OTHER
911Mothers_2010W BEFORE WE KNEW EACH OTHERS NAMES OR ANYTHING WE HAD EMBRACED
911Mothers_2010W AND WEPT THEN WE SAT IN A CIRCLE
911Mothers_2010W WITH SUPPORT WITH HELP FROM PEOPLE EXPERIENCED IN THIS KIND OF RECONCILIATION AND AICHA STARTED AND SHE SAID
911Mothers_2010W I DON 'T KNOW IF MY SON IS GUILTY OR INNOCENT BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW SORRY I AM FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FAMILIES
911Mothers_2010W I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO SUFFER
911Mothers_2010W AND I FEEL THAT IF THERE IS A CRIME A PERSON SHOULD BE TRIED FAIRLY AND PUNISHED
911Mothers_2010W BUT
911Mothers_2010W SHE REACHED OUT TO US IN THAT WAY AND IT WAS I 'D LIKE TO SAY IT WAS AN ICE BREAKER AND WHAT HAPPENED THEN IS WE ALL TOLD OUR STORIES
911Mothers_2010W AND WE ALL CONNECTED AS HUMAN BEINGS BY THE END OF THE AFTERNOON IT WAS ABOUT THREE HOURS AFTER LUNCH
911Mothers_2010W WE 'D FELT AS IF WE 'D KNOWN EACH OTHER FOREVER NOW WHAT I LEARNED FROM HER IS A WOMAN NOT ONLY WHO COULD BE SO GENEROUS UNDER THESE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHAT IT WAS THEN AND WHAT WAS BEING DONE TO HER SON BUT THE LIFE SHE 'S HAD I NEVER HAD MET
911Mothers_2010W SOMEONE WITH SUCH A HARD LIFE FROM SUCH A TOTALLY DIFFERENT CULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT FROM MY OWN
911Mothers_2010W BEING AFRAID OF THE OTHER BUT MAKING THAT STEP
911Mothers_2010W AND THEN REALIZING HEY THIS WASN 'T SO HARD WHO ELSE CAN I MEET THAT I DON 'T KNOW OR THAT I 'M SO DIFFERENT FROM
911Mothers_2010W SO AICHA DO YOU HAVE
911Mothers_2010W A COUPLE OF WORDS FOR CONCLUSION BECAUSE OUR TIME IS UP
911Mothers_2010W I WANTED TO SAY THAT WE HAVE TO TRY TO KNOW OTHER PEOPLE THE OTHER
911Mothers_2010W AND I HOPE THAT SOMEDAY WE 'LL ALL LIVE TOGETHER IN PEACE AND RESPECTING EACH OTHER THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO SAY
