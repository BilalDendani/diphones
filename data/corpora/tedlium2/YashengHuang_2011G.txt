YashengHuang_2011G@18.69:27.55 IN CHINA AND INDIA AND THE QUESTION I WANT TO EXPLORE WITH YOU IS WHETHER OR NOT DEMOCRACY HAS HELPED
YashengHuang_2011G@27.74:30.35 OR HAS HINDERED ECONOMIC GROWTH
YashengHuang_2011G@30.7:38.43 YOU MAY SAY THIS IS NOT FAIR BECAUSE I 'M SELECTING TWO COUNTRIES TO MAKE A CASE AGAINST DEMOCRACY
YashengHuang_2011G@39.22:48.95 ACTUALLY EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE IS WHAT I 'M GOING TO DO I 'M GOING TO USE THESE TWO COUNTRIES TO MAKE AN ECONOMIC ARGUMENT FOR DEMOCRACY
YashengHuang_2011G@48.95:59.8 RATHER THAN AGAINST DEMOCRACY THE FIRST QUESTION THERE IS WHY CHINA HAS GROWN SO MUCH FASTER THAN INDIA OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS
YashengHuang_2011G@59.8:73.25 IN TERMS OF THE GDP GROWTH RATES CHINA HAS GROWN AT TWICE THE RATE OF INDIA IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS THE TWO COUNTRIES HAVE BEGUN TO CONVERGE SOMEWHAT IN ECONOMIC GROWTH
YashengHuang_2011G@73.26:80.58 BUT OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS CHINA UNDOUBTEDLY HAS DONE MUCH BETTER THAN INDIA
YashengHuang_2011G@80.58:96.55 ONE SIMPLE ANSWER IS CHINA HAS SHANGHAI AND INDIA HAS MUMBAI LOOK AT THE SKYLINE OF SHANGHAI THIS IS THE PUDONG AREA THE PICTURE ON INDIA IS THE DHARAVI SLUM OF MUMBAI IN INDIA
YashengHuang_2011G@98.88:102.47 BEHIND THESE TWO PICTURES IS THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
YashengHuang_2011G@139.46:145.62 STEEPED IN HUMANISTIC VALUES AND YET HE AGREES WITH THE HIGH
YashengHuang_2011G@145.81:148.33 PRESSURE TACTICS OF SHANGHAI
YashengHuang_2011G@148.59:152.89 SO LET ME CALL IT THE SHANGHAI MODEL OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
YashengHuang_2011G@182.55:188.7 THE IMPLICATION OF THAT MODEL IS THAT DEMOCRACY IS A HINDRANCE FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH
YashengHuang_2011G@188.87:192.03 RATHER THAN A FACILITATOR OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
YashengHuang_2011G@210.61:219.23 IF YOU BELIEVE THAT INFRASTRUCTURES ARE NOT AS IMPORTANT AS MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THEN YOU WILL PUT LESS EMPHASIS ON STRONG GOVERNMENT
YashengHuang_2011G@219.68:230.98 SO TO ILLUSTRATE THAT QUESTION LET ME GIVE YOU TWO COUNTRIES AND FOR THE SAKE OF BREVITY I 'LL CALL ONE COUNTRY COUNTRY ONE AND THE OTHER COUNTRY COUNTRY TWO COUNTRY ONE
YashengHuang_2011G@231.24:236.99 HAS A SYSTEMATIC ADVANTAGE OVER COUNTRY TWO IN INFRASTRUCTURES
YashengHuang_2011G@236.99:242.89 COUNTRY ONE HAS MORE TELEPHONES AND COUNTRY ONE HAS A LONGER SYSTEM OF RAILWAYS
YashengHuang_2011G@242.89:251.6 SO IF I WERE TO ASK YOU WHICH IS CHINA AND WHICH IS INDIA AND WHICH COUNTRY HAS GROWN FASTER
YashengHuang_2011G@251.6:263.42 IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE VIEW THEN YOU WILL SAY COUNTRY ONE MUST BE CHINA THEY MUST HAVE DONE BETTER IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND COUNTRY TWO IS POSSIBLY INDIA
YashengHuang_2011G@264.14:279.05 ACTUALLY THE COUNTRY WITH MORE TELEPHONES IS THE SOVIET UNION AND THE DATA REFERRED TO ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE AFTER THE COUNTRY REPORTED VERY IMPRESSIVE STATISTICS ON TELEPHONES THE COUNTRY COLLAPSED
YashengHuang_2011G@301.44:320.56 SINCE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE THE COUNTRY HAS PERFORMED AT A DOUBLE DIGIT RATE EVERY YEAR FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IF YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT CHINA AND THE SOVIET UNION OTHER THAN THE FACT ABOUT THEIR TELEPHONES YOU WOULD HAVE MADE A POOR PREDICTION ABOUT THEIR ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE NEXT TWO DECADES
YashengHuang_2011G@320.82:327.7 COUNTRY ONE THAT HAS A LONGER SYSTEM OF RAILWAYS IS ACTUALLY INDIA AND COUNTRY TWO IS CHINA
YashengHuang_2011G@327.92:330.2 THIS IS A VERY
YashengHuang_2011G@330.21:337.93 LITTLE KNOWN FACT ABOUT THE TWO COUNTRIES YES TODAY CHINA HAS A HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE ADVANTAGE OVER INDIA
YashengHuang_2011G@350.76:369.15 IS THE RAILWAYS AND THE BRITISH BUILT A LOT OF RAILWAYS IN INDIA INDIA IS THE SMALLER OF THE TWO COUNTRIES AND YET IT HAD A LONGER SYSTEM OF RAILWAYS UNTIL THE LATE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY S SO CLEARLY INFRASTRUCTURE DOESN 'T EXPLAIN WHY CHINA DID BETTER
YashengHuang_2011G@369.15:372.67 BEFORE THE LATE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY S AS COMPARED WITH INDIA
YashengHuang_2011G@372.67:376.06 IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE WORLDWIDE
YashengHuang_2011G@376.29:383.34 THE EVIDENCE IS MORE SUPPORTIVE OF THE VIEW THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE ARE ACTUALLY THE RESULT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
YashengHuang_2011G@395.47:399.7 AND THIS IS CLEARLY THE STORY OF THE CHINESE ECONOMIC GROWTH
YashengHuang_2011G@400.46:405.75 LET ME LOOK AT THIS QUESTION MORE DIRECTLY IS DEMOCRACY BAD FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH
YashengHuang_2011G@424.47:438.67 COUNTRY B WITH DOLLAR SEVEN HUNDRED PER CAPITA GDP AS COMPARED WITH DOLLAR SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY PER CAPITA GDP BOTH COUNTRIES ARE IN ASIA IF I WERE TO ASK YOU WHICH ARE THE TWO ASIAN COUNTRIES
YashengHuang_2011G@453.97:462.52 THE COUNTRY THAT HAS A LONG PERIOD OF MILITARY RULE AND IT 'S VERY COMMON THAT WE COMPARE INDIA WITH CHINA
YashengHuang_2011G@463.17:465.32 THAT 'S BECAUSE THE TWO COUNTRIES HAVE
YashengHuang_2011G@465.74:468.46 ABOUT THE SAME POPULATION SIZE
YashengHuang_2011G@468.46:486.08 BUT THE MORE NATURAL COMPARISON IS ACTUALLY BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN THOSE TWO COUNTRIES ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY SIMILAR THEY HAVE A COMPLICATED BUT SHARED COMMON HISTORY BY THAT COMPARISON DEMOCRACY LOOKS VERY VERY GOOD IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
YashengHuang_2011G@486.96:491.86 SO WHY DO ECONOMISTS FALL IN LOVE WITH AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS
YashengHuang_2011G@492.35:494.93 ONE REASON IS THE EAST ASIAN MODEL
YashengHuang_2011G@517.26:518.77 HAVE YOU WON THE LOTTERY
YashengHuang_2011G@519.17:521.85 AND THEY ALL TELL YOU YES WE HAVE WON THE LOTTERY
YashengHuang_2011G@522.09:527.31 AND THEN YOU DRAW THE CONCLUSION THE ODDS OF WINNING THE LOTTERY ARE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT
YashengHuang_2011G@556.32:569.84 IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICAL EVIDENCE WORLDWIDE THERE 'S REALLY NO SUPPORT FOR THE IDEA THAT AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS HOLD A SYSTEMATIC EDGE OVER DEMOCRACIES IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
YashengHuang_2011G@569.84:579.75 SO THE EAST ASIAN MODEL HAS THIS MASSIVE SELECTION BIAS IT IS KNOWN AS SELECTING ON A DEPENDENT VARIABLE SOMETHING WE ALWAYS TELL OUR STUDENTS TO AVOID
YashengHuang_2011G@580.36:582.55 SO EXACTLY WHY DID CHINA
YashengHuang_2011G@592.21:597.51 UNDER INDIRA GANDHI THE QUESTION THERE IS WHICH COUNTRY DID BETTER
YashengHuang_2011G@613.33:615.75 SO THAT 'S WHEN CHINA WAS MAD
YashengHuang_2011G@629.19:631.28 THE ADVANTAGE THE COUNTRY HAD
YashengHuang_2011G@631.3:632.89 WAS HUMAN
YashengHuang_2011G@656.48:661.82 IS ESPECIALLY SHARP BETWEEN CHINESE WOMEN AND INDIAN WOMEN
YashengHuang_2011G@662.48:673.56 I HAVEN 'T TOLD YOU ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF LITERACY IN CHINA THE DEFINITION OF LITERACY IS THE ABILITY TO READ AND WRITE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CHINESE CHARACTERS
YashengHuang_2011G@674.09:686.66 IN INDIA THE DEFINITION OF LITERACY OPERATING DEFINITION OF LITERACY IS THE ABILITY THE GRAND ABILITY TO WRITE YOUR OWN NAME IN WHATEVER LANGUAGE YOU HAPPEN TO SPEAK
YashengHuang_2011G@686.66:694.24 THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF LITERACY IS MUCH MORE SUBSTANTIAL THAN THE DATA HERE INDICATED
YashengHuang_2011G@694.24:711.42 IF YOU GO TO OTHER SOURCES OF DATA SUCH AS HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX THAT DATA SERIES GO BACK TO THE EARLY ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY S YOU SEE EXACTLY THE SAME CONTRAST CHINA HELD A HUGE ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF HUMAN CAPITAL VIS A VIS INDIA
YashengHuang_2011G@711.42:716.44 LIFE EXPECTANCIES AS EARLY AS ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE CHINA HAD
YashengHuang_2011G@716.71:735.43 A HUGE ADVANTAGE IN LIFE EXPECTANCY ON AVERAGE AS A CHINESE IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE YOU LIVED TEN YEARS MORE THAN AN AVERAGE INDIAN SO IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN BEING A CHINESE AND BEING AN INDIAN YOU WOULD WANT TO BECOME A CHINESE IN ORDER TO LIVE TEN YEARS LONGER
YashengHuang_2011G@735.6:747.16 IF YOU MADE THAT DECISION IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THE DOWN SIDE OF THAT IS THE NEXT YEAR WE HAVE THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION SO YOU HAVE TO ALWAYS THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT THESE DECISIONS
YashengHuang_2011G@760.23:763.04 THIS IS AN EXTREMELY STRANGE
YashengHuang_2011G@775.54:780.36 THE GOOD NEWS IS BY TWO THOUSAND AND SIX INDIA HAS CLOSED THE GAP
YashengHuang_2011G@814.59:822.54 FINANCIAL TIMES PRINTED THIS PICTURE OF AN INDIAN TEXTILE FACTORY WITH THE TITLE INDIA POISED TO OVERTAKE CHINA IN TEXTILE
YashengHuang_2011G@846.45:861.95 THEN THE ISSUE IS WHAT ABOUT THE CHINESE POLITICAL SYSTEM YOU TALK ABOUT HUMAN CAPITAL YOU TALK ABOUT EDUCATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH WHAT ABOUT THE POLITICAL SYSTEM ISN 'T IT TRUE THAT THE ONE PARTY POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS FACILITATED ECONOMIC GROWTH IN CHINA
YashengHuang_2011G@861.95:866.71 ACTUALLY THE ANSWER IS MORE NUANCED AND SUBTLE THAN THAT
YashengHuang_2011G@886.94:901.38 WHEN YOU EXPLAIN CHANGE FOR EXAMPLE ECONOMIC GROWTH ECONOMIC GROWTH IS ABOUT CHANGE WHEN YOU EXPLAIN CHANGE YOU USE OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE CHANGED TO EXPLAIN CHANGE RATHER THAN USING THE CONSTANT TO EXPLAIN CHANGE
YashengHuang_2011G@910.34:926.36 IN TERMS OF THE POLITICAL CHANGES THEY HAVE INTRODUCED VILLAGE ELECTIONS THEY HAVE INCREASED THE SECURITY OF PROPRIETORS AND THEY HAVE INCREASED THE SECURITY WITH LONG TERM LAND LEASES THERE ARE ALSO FINANCIAL REFORMS IN RURAL CHINA
YashengHuang_2011G@926.36:934.39 THERE IS ALSO A RURAL ENTREPRENEURIAL REVOLUTION IN CHINA TO ME THE PACE OF POLITICAL CHANGES IS TOO SLOW TOO GRADUAL
YashengHuang_2011G@950.57:956.65 YOU CAN APPLY EXACTLY THE SAME DYNAMIC PERSPECTIVE ON INDIA IN FACT
YashengHuang_2011G@973.61:987.22 A LITTLE KNOWN FACT ABOUT INDIA IN THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY S IS THAT THE COUNTRY NOT ONLY HAS UNDERTAKEN ECONOMIC REFORMS THE COUNTRY HAS ALSO UNDERTAKEN POLITICAL REFORMS BY INTRODUCING VILLAGE SELF
YashengHuang_2011G@987.71:990.07 PRIVATIZATION OF MEDIA
YashengHuang_2011G@990.16:1000.27 AND INTRODUCING FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACTS SO THE DYNAMIC PERSPECTIVE FITS BOTH WITH CHINA AND IN INDIA IN TERMS OF THE DIRECTION
YashengHuang_2011G@1000.8:1004.99 WHY DO MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT INDIA IS STILL A GROWTH
YashengHuang_2011G@1026.39:1030.38 COMPARING WITH A SUPERSTAR IS THE WRONG BENCHMARK
YashengHuang_2011G@1030.38:1034.67 IN FACT IF YOU COMPARE INDIA WITH THE AVERAGE DEVELOPING COUNTRY
YashengHuang_2011G@1034.67:1053.89 EVEN BEFORE THE MORE RECENT PERIOD OF ACCELERATION OF INDIAN GROWTH NOW INDIA IS GROWING BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE PERCENT EVEN BEFORE THIS PERIOD INDIA WAS RANKED FOURTH IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AMONG EMERGING ECONOMIES THIS IS A VERY IMPRESSIVE RECORD INDEED
YashengHuang_2011G@1064.99:1070.08 SOME OF THE EXCELLENT RAW FUNDAMENTALS MOSTLY THE SOCIAL
YashengHuang_2011G@1070.4:1078.94 THE PUBLIC HEALTH THE SENSE OF EGALITARIANISM THAT YOU DON 'T FIND IN INDIA BUT I BELIEVE THAT INDIA HAS THE MOMENTUM
YashengHuang_2011G@1091.63:1100.11 INDIA HAS THE RIGHT INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH WHEREAS CHINA IS STILL STRUGGLING WITH POLITICAL REFORMS
YashengHuang_2011G@1100.16:1105.6 I BELIEVE THAT THE POLITICAL REFORMS ARE A MUST FOR CHINA TO MAINTAIN ITS GROWTH
