SarahParcak_2012U@16.3:31.76 I WAS A CHILD GROWING UP IN MAINE ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO DO WAS TO LOOK FOR SAND DOLLARS ON THE SEASHORES OF MAINE BECAUSE MY PARENTS TOLD ME IT WOULD BRING ME LUCK BUT YOU KNOW THESE SHELLS THEY 'RE HARD TO FIND THEY 'RE COVERED IN SAND THEY 'RE DIFFICULT TO SEE
SarahParcak_2012U@31.76:40.38 HOWEVER OVERTIME I GOT USED TO LOOKING FOR THEM I STARTED SEEING SHAPES AND PATTERNS THAT HELPED ME TO COLLECT THEM
SarahParcak_2012U@40.38:57.14 THIS GREW INTO A PASSION FOR FINDING THINGS A LOVE FOR THE PAST AND ARCHAEOLOGY AND EVENTUALLY WHEN I STARTED STUDYING EGYPTOLOGY I REALIZED THAT SEEING WITH MY NAKED EYES ALONE WASN 'T ENOUGH BECAUSE ALL OF THE SUDDEN IN EGYPT
SarahParcak_2012U@57.14:64.23 MY BEACH HAD GROWN FROM A TINY BEACH IN MAINE TO ONE EIGHT HUNDRED MILES LONG NEXT TO THE NILE
SarahParcak_2012U@64.56:81.71 AND MY SAND DOLLARS HAD GROWN TO THE SIZE OF CITIES THIS IS REALLY WHAT BROUGHT ME TO USING SATELLITE IMAGERY FOR TRYING TO MAP THE PAST I KNEW THAT I HAD TO SEE DIFFERENTLY SO I WANT TO SHOW YOU AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE SEE DIFFERENTLY USING THE INFRARED
SarahParcak_2012U@81.96:91.04 THIS IS A SITE LOCATED IN THE EASTERN EGYPTIAN DELTA CALLED BENDIX AND THE SITE VISIBLY APPEARS BROWN BUT WHEN WE USE THE INFRARED
SarahParcak_2012U@91.46:93.96 AND WE PROCESS IT ALL OF THE SUDDEN
SarahParcak_2012U@117.57:137.34 MISSING FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS ITJTAWY WAS ANCIENT EGYPT 'S CAPITAL FOR OVER FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AT A PERIOD OF TIME CALLED THE MIDDLE KINGDOM ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND YEARS AGO THE SITE IS LOCATED IN THE FAIYUM OF EGYPT AND SITE IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IN THE MIDDLE KINGDOM THERE WAS THIS GREAT RENAISSANCE FOR ANCIENT EGYPTIAN ART
SarahParcak_2012U@137.35:149.62 ARCHITECTURE AND RELIGION EGYPTOLOGISTS HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THE SITE OF ITJTAWY WAS LOCATED SOMEWHERE NEAR THE PYRAMIDS OF THE TWO KINGS WHO BUILT IT INDICATED WITHIN THE RED CIRCLES HERE
SarahParcak_2012U@149.62:164.3 BUT SOMEWHERE WITHIN THIS MASSIVE FLOOD PLANE THIS AREA IS HUGE IT 'S FOUR MILES BY THREE MILES IN SIZE THE NILE USED TO FLOW RIGHT NEXT TO THE CITY OF ITJTAWY AND AS IT SHIFTED AND CHANGED AND MOVED OVER TIME TO THE EAST IT COVERED OVER THE CITY
SarahParcak_2012U@164.55:172.87 SO HOW DO YOU FIND A BURIED CITY IN A VAST LANDSCAPE FINDING IT RANDOMLY WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT
SarahParcak_2012U@173.05:177.74 OF LOCATING A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK BLINDFOLDED WEARING BASEBALL MITTS
SarahParcak_2012U@177.74:196.71 SO WHAT WE DID IS WE USED NASA TOPOGRAPHY DATA TO MAP OUT THE LANDSCAPE VERY SUBTLE CHANGES WE STARTED TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHERE THE NILE USED TO FLOW BUT YOU CAN SEE IN MORE DETAIL AND EVEN MORE INTERESTING THIS VERY SLIGHT RAISED AREA SEEN WITHIN THE CIRCLE UP HERE WHICH WE THOUGHT COULD POSSIBLY BE THE LOCATION
SarahParcak_2012U@229.19:231.81 WE ALSO FOUND WORK STONE
SarahParcak_2012U@243.67:256.65 THESE ARE THE STONES THAT WERE USED SO WE HAVE A DENSE LAYER OF OCCUPATION DATING TO THE MIDDLE KINGDOM AT THIS SITE WE ALSO HAVE EVIDENCE OF AN ELITE JEWELERS WORKSHOP SHOWING THAT WHATEVER WAS THERE WAS A VERY IMPORTANT CITY
SarahParcak_2012U@272.39:281.42 SO I WANTED TO END WITH MY FAVORITE QUOTE FROM THE MIDDLE KINGDOM IT WAS PROBABLY WRITTEN AT THE CITY OF ITJTAWY FOUR THOUSAND YEARS AGO
