JanePoynter_2009@12.98:13.12 I
JanePoynter_2009@16.02:24.95 OF LIVING INSIDE TWO BIOSPHERES OF COURSE WE ALL HERE IN THIS ROOM LIVE IN BIOSPHERE ONE I'VE ALSO LIVED IN BIOSPHERE TWO
JanePoynter_2009@35.52:48.66 HERE I AM INSIDE BIOSPHERE TWO MAKING A PIZZA SO I AM HARVESTING THE WHEAT IN ORDER TO MAKE THE DOUGH AND THEN OF COURSE I HAVE TO MILK THE GOATS AND FEED THE GOATS IN ORDER TO MAKE THE CHEESE IT TOOK ME FOUR MONTHS IN BIOSPHERE TWO TO MAKE A PIZZA
JanePoynter_2009@49.10:57.79 HERE IN BIOSPHERE ONE WELL IT TAKES ME ABOUT TWO MINUTES BECAUSE I PICK UP THE PHONE AND I CALL AND SAY HEY CAN YOU DELIVER THE PIZZA SO BIOSPHERE TWO
JanePoynter_2009@58.18:65.25 WAS ESSENTIALLY A THREE ACRE ENTIRELY SEALED MINIATURE WORLD THAT I LIVED IN FOR TWO YEARS AND TWENTY MINUTES
JanePoynter_2009@68.39:79.57 THE TOP IT WAS SEALED WITH STEEL AND GLASS UNDERNEATH IT WAS SEALED WITH A PAN OF STEEL ESSENTIALLY ENTIRELY SEALED SO WE HAD OUR OWN MINIATURE RAINFOREST A PRIVATE BEACH WITH A CORAL REEF WE HAD A
JanePoynter_2009@82.17:87.00 WE HAD OUR OWN HALF ACRE FARM THAT WE HAD TO GROW EVERYTHING AND OF COURSE WE HAD OUR HUMAN HABITAT
JanePoynter_2009@88.34:95.49 IN THE MID EIGHTIES WHEN WE WERE DESIGNING BIOSPHERE TWO WE HAD TO ASK OURSELVES SOME PRETTY BASIC QUESTIONS I MEAN WHAT IS A BIOSPHERE
JanePoynter_2009@95.81:103.33 BACK THEN YES I GUESS WE ALL KNOW NOW THAT IT IS ESSENTIALLY THE SPHERE OF LIFE AROUND THE EARTH RIGHT WELL YOU HAVE TO GET A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC THAN THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD ONE
JanePoynter_2009@103.75:114.98 AND SO WE DECIDED THAT WHAT IT REALLY IS IS THAT IT IS ENTIRELY MATERIALLY CLOSED THAT IS NOTHING GOES IN OR OUT AT ALL NO MATERIAL AND ENERGETICALLY OPEN WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY
JanePoynter_2009@116.91:129.36 THIS IS A CHAMBER THAT WAS ONE FOUR HUNDREDTH THE SIZE OF BIOSPHERE TWO THAT WE CALLED OUR TEST MODULE AND THE VERY FIRST DAY THAT THIS FELLOW JOHN ALLEN WALKED IN TO SPEND A COUPLE OF DAYS IN THERE WITH ALL THE PLANTS AND ANIMALS AND BACTERIA THAT WE'D PUT IN THERE TO HOPEFULLY KEEP HIM ALIVE
JanePoynter_2009@129.71:138.96 THE DOCTORS WERE INCREDIBLY CONCERNED THAT HE WAS GOING TO SUCCUMB TO SOME DREADFUL TOXIN OR THAT HIS LUNGS WERE GOING TO GET CHOKED WITH BACTERIA OR SOMETHING FUNGUS BUT OF COURSE NONE OF THAT HAPPENED
JanePoynter_2009@166.15:175.10 WE WANTED TO KNOW THIS BOTH FOR BEING ABLE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE UNIVERSE IF WE WERE GOING TO GO TO MARS FOR INSTANCE WOULD WE TAKE A BIOSPHERE WITH US TO LIVE IN IT WE ALSO WANTED TO KNOW
JanePoynter_2009@186.61:197.49 WILL SOMETHING HAPPEN THAT WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND AND WE CAN'T FIX THEREBY NEGATING THE CONCEPT OF MAN MADE BIOSPHERES SO EIGHT OF US WENT IN FOUR MEN AND FOUR WOMEN
JanePoynter_2009@204.37:206.23 WE LIVED IN SO ON THE TOP
JanePoynter_2009@206.33:218.15 WE HAD THESE BEAUTIFUL RAINFORESTS AND AN OCEAN AND UNDERNEATH WE HAD ALL THIS TECHNOSPHERE WE CALLED IT WHICH IS WHERE ALL THE PUMPS AND THE VALVES AND THE WATER TANKS AND THE AIR HANDLERS AND ALL OF THAT
JanePoynter_2009@227.01:231.55 THIS IS THE AGRICULTURE IT WAS ESSENTIALLY AN ORGANIC FARM
JanePoynter_2009@242.82:246.91 THAT MOMENT I BECAME PART OF THAT BIOSPHERE
JanePoynter_2009@247.00:258.26 AND I DON'T MEAN THAT IN AN ABSTRACT SENSE I MEAN IT RATHER LITERALLY WHEN I BREATHED OUT MY CO TWO FED THE SWEET POTATOES THAT I WAS GROWING
JanePoynter_2009@258.85:262.19 AND WE ATE AN AWFUL LOT OF THE SWEET POTATOES
JanePoynter_2009@263.14:271.76 AND THOSE SWEET POTATOES BECAME PART OF ME IN FACT WE ATE SO MANY SWEET POTATOES I BECAME ORANGE WITH SWEET POTATO I
JanePoynter_2009@288.23:296.27 QUITE A LOT OF OXYGEN AND WE KNEW THAT WE WERE LOSING CO TWO AND SO WE WERE WORKING TO SEQUESTER CARBON GOOD LORD WE KNOW THAT TERM NOW
JanePoynter_2009@296.57:304.36 WE WERE GROWING PLANTS LIKE CRAZY WE WERE TAKING THEIR BIOMASS STORING THEM IN THE BASEMENT GROWING PLANTS GOING AROUND AROUND AROUND TRYING TO TAKE ALL OF THAT CARBON OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE
JanePoynter_2009@304.68:313.39 WE WERE TRYING TO STOP CARBON FROM GOING IN TO THE ATMOSPHERE WE STOPPED IRRIGATING OUR SOIL AS MUCH AS WE COULD WE STOPPED TILLING SO THAT WE COULD PREVENT GREENHOUSE GASSES FROM GOING INTO THE AIR
JanePoynter_2009@313.82:321.62 BUT OUR OXYGEN WAS GOING DOWN FASTER THAN OUR CO TWO WAS GOING UP WHICH WAS QUITE UNEXPECTED BECAUSE WE HAD SEEN THEM GOING IN TANDEM IN THE TEST MODULE
JanePoynter_2009@363.92:372.96 AND THE DOCTOR WAS IN FACT CHECKING US TO MAKE SURE WE WERE IN FACT FINE BUT IN FACT HE WAS THE PERSON WHO WAS MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE OXYGEN AND ONE DAY HE COULDN'T ADD UP A LINE
JanePoynter_2009@374.10:382.45 IT WAS TIME FOR US TO PUT OXYGEN IN AND YOU MIGHT THINK WELL BOY YOUR LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM WAS FAILING YOU
JanePoynter_2009@384.75:386.48 IN A SENSE IT WAS
JanePoynter_2009@399.71:411.21 IT WAS THE SCIENTIFIC GOLD OF THE PROJECT BECAUSE WE COULD REALLY CRANK THIS BABY UP AS A SCIENTIFIC TOOL AND SEE IF WE COULD IN FACT FIND WHERE THOSE SEVEN TONS OF OXYGEN HAD GONE AND
JanePoynter_2009@427.43:435.57 AT THE END OF THE TWO YEARS WHEN WE CAME OUT WE WERE ELATED BECAUSE IN FACT ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT SAY WE HAD DISCOVERED SOMETHING THAT WAS QUITE
JanePoynter_2009@436.20:447.80 WHEN YOUR OXYGEN IS GOING DOWN STOPPED WORKING ESSENTIALLY IN YOUR LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT'S A VERY BAD FAILURE EXCEPT THAT WE KNEW WHAT IT WAS AND WE KNEW HOW TO FIX IT AND NOTHING ELSE EMERGED
JanePoynter_2009@448.29:457.86 THAT REALLY WAS AS SERIOUS AS THAT AND WE PROVED THE CONCEPT MORE OR LESS PEOPLE ON THE OTHER HAND WAS A DIFFERENT SUBJECT WE WERE I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WERE FIXABLE
JanePoynter_2009@458.63:473.77 WE ALL WENT QUITE NUTS I WILL SAY AND THE DAY I CAME OUT OF BIOSPHERE TWO I WAS THRILLED I WAS GOING TO SEE ALL MY FAMILY AND MY FRIENDS FOR TWO YEARS I'D BEEN SEEING PEOPLE THROUGH THE GLASS AND EVERYBODY RAN UP TO ME AND I RECOILED
JanePoynter_2009@476.10:478.18 PEOPLE STINK WE STINK OF
JanePoynter_2009@478.91:489.07 AND UNDERARM DEODERANT AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF NOW WE HAD STUFF INSIDE BIOSPHERE TO KEEP OURSELVES CLEAN BUT NOTHING WITH PERFUME AND BOY DO WE STINK OUT HERE
JanePoynter_2009@490.61:491.45 NOT ONLY THAT
JanePoynter_2009@493.93:498.86 LOST TOUCH OF WHERE MY FOOD CAME FROM I HAD BEEN GROWING ALL MY OWN FOOD
JanePoynter_2009@506.92:511.64 FOR HOURS IN THE ISLES OF SHOPS READING ALL THE NAMES ON ALL OF THE THINGS PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT I WAS
JanePoynter_2009@513.24:515.00 IT WAS REALLY QUITE
JanePoynter_2009@520.32:528.34 LOST TRACK OF WHERE I WAS IN THIS BIG BIOSPHERE IN THIS BIG BIOSPHERE THAT WE ALL LIVE IN IN BIOSPHERE TWO I TOTALLY UNDERSTOOD
JanePoynter_2009@529.05:535.44 THAT I HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON MY BIOSPHERE EVERYDAY AND IT HAD AN IMPACT ON ME VERY VISCERALLY VERY
JanePoynter_2009@544.21:550.60 AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID WAS TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW SMALL CAN YOU MAKE THESE BIOSPHERES AND WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THEM
JanePoynter_2009@550.90:560.39 AND SO WE SENT ONE ONTO THE MIR SPACE STATION WE HAD ONE ON THE SHUTTLE AND ONE ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION FOR SIXTEEN MONTHS WHERE WE MANAGED TO PRODUCE THE FIRST ORGANISMS TO GO THROUGH
JanePoynter_2009@569.22:577.59 AND I'M ALSO PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT YOU'RE GETTING A SNEAK PREVIEW ON FRIDAY WE'RE GOING TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY FORMING A TEAM TO
JanePoynter_2009@599.82:611.87 I ENDED UP IN ALL PLACES IN ERITREA IN THE HORN OF AFRICA ERITREA FORMERLY PART OF ETHIOPIA IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES THAT IS ASTONISHINGLY BEAUTIFUL
JanePoynter_2009@620.76:622.02 THIS IS WHAT I SAW
JanePoynter_2009@622.39:625.48 BUT THIS IS ALSO WHAT I SAW I SAW
JanePoynter_2009@627.15:633.14 THAT HAD TAKEN SEAWATER AND SAND AND THEY WERE GROWING
JanePoynter_2009@633.43:640.79 A KIND OF CROP THAT WILL GROW ON PURE SALT WATER WITHOUT HAVING TO TREAT IT AND IT WILL PRODUCE A FOOD CROP IN THIS CASE IT WAS OILSEED
JanePoynter_2009@641.40:650.47 IT WAS ASTONISHING THEY WERE ALSO PRODUCING MANGROVES IN A PLANTATION AND THE MANGROVES WHERE PROVIDING WOOD AND HONEY AND LEAVES FOR THE ANIMALS
JanePoynter_2009@650.87:662.24 SO THAT THEY COULD PRODUCE MILK AND WHATNOT LIKE WE HAD IN THE BIOSPHERE AND ALL OF IT WAS COMING FROM THIS SHRIMP FARMS SHRIMP FARMS ARE A SCOURGE ON THE EARTH FRANKLY FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL POINT OF VIEW
JanePoynter_2009@662.79:670.69 THEY POUR HUGE AMOUNTS OF POLLUTANTS INTO THE OCEAN THEY ALSO POLLUTE THEIR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS SO THEY'RE ALL SHITTING EACH OTHER 'S PONDS QUITE LITERALLY
JanePoynter_2009@672.47:678.80 WHAT THIS PROJECT WAS DOING WAS TAKING THE EFFLUENT OF THESE AND TURNING THEM INTO ALL OF THIS FOOD
JanePoynter_2009@679.02:687.56 THEY WERE LITERALLY TURNING POLLUTION INTO ABUNDANCE FOR A DESERT PEOPLE THEY HAD CREATED AN INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM OF A SENSE
JanePoynter_2009@687.97:695.34 I WAS THERE BECAUSE I WAS ACTUALLY MODELING THE MANGROVE PORTION FOR A CARBON CREDIT PROGRAM UNDER THE U N KYOTO PROTOCOL SYSTEM AND
JanePoynter_2009@695.85:701.26 WAS MODELING THIS MANGROVE SWAMP I WAS THINKING TO MYSELF HOW DO YOU PUT A BOX AROUND THIS WHEN I'M MODELING
JanePoynter_2009@702.05:710.84 IN A BOX LITERALLY I KNOW WHERE TO DRAW THE BOUNDARY IN A MANGROVE FOREST LIKE THIS I HAVE NO IDEA WELL OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO DRAW THE BOUNDARY AROUND THE WHOLE OF THE
JanePoynter_2009@725.32:734.11 CALL A BIOCIDAL SPECIES ONE THAT WHETHER WE INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY HAVE DESIGNED OUR SYSTEMS TO KILL LIFE
JanePoynter_2009@734.46:743.21 A LOT OF THE TIME THIS IS IN FACT THIS BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPH IS IN FACT OVER THE AMAZON AND HERE THE LIGHT GREEN
JanePoynter_2009@743.93:750.81 AREAS OF MASSIVE DEFORESTATION AND THOSE BEAUTIFUL WISPY CLOUDS ARE IN FACT FIRES HUMAN MADE
JanePoynter_2009@752.48:764.48 IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMING FROM THIS TO WHAT I WOULD CALL A BIOPHILIC SOCIETY ONE WHERE WE LEARN TO NURTURE SOCIETY NOW IT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE IT
JanePoynter_2009@765.28:774.80 BUT WE ARE IT IS HAPPENING ALL ACROSS THE WORLD IN EVERY KIND OF WALK OF LIFE AND EVERY KIND OF CAREER AND INDUSTRY THAT YOU CAN THINK
