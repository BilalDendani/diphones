CarolynSteel_2009G@17.23:27.15 FEED A CITY IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT QUESTIONS OF OUR TIME YET IT'S ONE THAT'S RARELY ASKED WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT IF WE GO INTO A SHOP OR RESTAURANT
CarolynSteel_2009G@27.52:41.55 OR INDEED INTO THIS THEATER 'S FOYER IN ABOUT AN HOUR 'S TIME THERE IS GOING TO BE FOOD THERE WAITING FOR US HAVING MAGICALLY COME FROM SOMEWHERE BUT WHEN YOU THINK THAT EVERY DAY FOR A CITY THE SIZE OF LONDON ENOUGH FOOD HAS TO
CarolynSteel_2009G@42.38:48.10 PRODUCED TRANSPORTED BOUGHT AND SOLD COOKED
CarolynSteel_2009G@50.48:55.95 AND THAT SOMETHING SIMILAR HAS TO HAPPEN EVERY DAY FOR EVERY CITY ON EARTH IT'S REMARKABLE THAT CITIES
CarolynSteel_2009G@57.89:70.83 WE LIVE IN PLACES LIKE THIS AS IF THEY'RE THE MOST NATURAL THINGS IN THE WORLD FORGETTING THAT BECAUSE WE'RE ANIMALS AND THAT WE NEED TO EAT WE'RE ACTUALLY AS DEPENDENT ON THE NATURAL WORLD AS OUR ANCIENT
CarolynSteel_2009G@71.67:84.18 WERE AND AS MORE OF US MOVE INTO CITIES MORE OF THAT NATURAL WORLD IS BEING TRANSFORMED INTO EXTRAORDINARY LANDSCAPES LIKE THE ONE BEHIND ME IT'S SOYBEAN FIELDS IN MATA GROSSO IN BRAZIL IN
CarolynSteel_2009G@86.64:93.19 THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARY LANDSCAPES BUT FEW OF US EVER GET TO SEE THEM AND INCREASINGLY THESE LANDSCAPES ARE NOT JUST FEEDING
CarolynSteel_2009G@94.99:105.01 AS MORE OF US MOVE INTO CITIES MORE OF US ARE EATING MEAT SO THAT A THIRD OF THE ANNUAL GRAIN CROP GLOBALLY NOW GETS FED TO ANIMALS RATHER THAN TO US HUMAN ANIMALS
CarolynSteel_2009G@105.38:116.08 AND GIVEN THAT IT TAKES THREE TIMES AS MUCH GRAIN ACTUALLY TEN TIMES AS MUCH GRAIN TO FEED A HUMAN IF IT'S PASSED THROUGH AN ANIMAL FIRST THAT'S NOT A VERY EFFICIENT WAY
CarolynSteel_2009G@116.64:126.02 FEEDING US AN IT'S AN ESCALATING PROBLEM TOO BY TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTY IT'S ESTIMATED THAT TWICE THE NUMBER OF US ARE GOING TO BE LIVING IN CITIES
CarolynSteel_2009G@126.28:129.91 IT'S ALSO ESTIMATED THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE TWICE AS MUCH MEAT AND DAIRY
CarolynSteel_2009G@133.98:141.29 RISING HAND IN HAND AND THAT'S GOING TO POSE AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM SIX BILLION HUNGRY CARNIVORES TO FEED BY
CarolynSteel_2009G@144.26:153.41 THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM AND ACTUALLY IF WE CARRY ON AS WE ARE IT'S A PROBLEM WE'RE VERY UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE NINETEEN MILLION HECTARES OF RAINFOREST ARE LOST EVERY YEAR
CarolynSteel_2009G@153.77:159.43 TO CREATE NEW ARABLE LAND ALTHOUGH AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE LOSING AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF EXISTING ARABLES TO
CarolynSteel_2009G@162.38:171.97 WE'RE VERY HUNGRY FOR FOSSIL FUELS TOO IT TAKES ABOUT TEN CALORIES TO PRODUCE EVERY CALORIE OF FOOD THAT WE CONSUME IN THE WEST
CarolynSteel_2009G@172.95:181.91 AND EVEN THOUGH THERE IS FOOD THAT WE ARE PRODUCING AT GREAT COST WE DON'T ACTUALLY VALUE IT HALF THE FOOD PRODUCED IN THE USA IS CURRENTLY THROWN AWAY
CarolynSteel_2009G@185.87:191.60 EVEN MANAGING TO FEED THE PLANET PROPERLY A BILLION OF US ARE OBESE WHILE A FURTHER BILLION
CarolynSteel_2009G@193.62:204.12 NONE OF IT MAKES VERY MUCH SENSE AND WHEN YOU THINK THAT EIGHTY PERCENT OF GLOBAL TRADE IN FOOD NOW IS CONTROLLED BY JUST FIVE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IT'S A GRIM PICTURE
CarolynSteel_2009G@205.93:218.66 INTO CITIES THE WORLD IS ALSO EMBRACING A WESTERN DIET AND IF WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE IT'S AN UNSUSTAINABLE DIET SO HOW DID WE GET HERE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT
CarolynSteel_2009G@219.23:230.82 WELL TO ANSWER THE SLIGHTLY EASIER QUESTION FIRST ABOUT TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO I WOULD SAY IS THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS IN THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST KNOWN AS THE FERTILE CRESCENT BECAUSE AS YOU CAN
CarolynSteel_2009G@231.41:240.47 SEE IT WAS CRESCENT SHAPED AND IT WAS ALSO FERTILE AND IT WAS HERE ABOUT TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO THAT TWO EXTRAORDINARY INVENTIONS AGRICULTURE
CarolynSteel_2009G@240.98:251.36 AND URBANISM HAPPENED ROUGHLY IN THE SAME PLACE AND AT THE SAME TIME THIS IS NO ACCIDENT BECAUSE AGRICULTURE AND CITIES ARE BOUND TOGETHER THEY NEED EACH OTHER
CarolynSteel_2009G@263.48:273.22 AND IF WE LOOK AT WHAT THOSE SETTLEMENTS WERE LIKE WE SEE THEY WERE COMPACT THEY WERE SURROUNDED BY PRODUCTIVE FARM LAND AND DOMINATED BY LARGE TEMPLE COMPLEXES LIKE THIS ONE
CarolynSteel_2009G@274.33:288.45 THAT WERE IN FACT EFFECTIVELY SPIRITUALIZED CENTRALIZED FOOD DISTRIBUTION CENTERS BECAUSE IT WAS THE TEMPLES THAT ORGANIZED THE HARVEST GATHERED IN THE GRAIN OFFERED IT TO THE GODS AND THEN OFFERED THE GRAIN THAT THE GODS DIDN'T EAT BACK TO THE PEOPLE
CarolynSteel_2009G@289.79:297.49 IF YOU LIKE THE WHOLE SPIRITUAL AND PHYSICAL LIFE OF THESE CITIES WAS DOMINATED BY THE GRAIN AND THE HARVEST THAT SUSTAINED THEM
CarolynSteel_2009G@298.11:309.97 AND IN FACT THAT'S TRUE OF EVERY ANCIENT CITY BUT OF COURSE NOT ALL OF THEM WERE THAT SMALL AND FAMOUSLY ROME HAD ABOUT A MILLION CITIZENS BY THE FIRST CENTURY A D SO HOW DID A CITY LIKE THIS
CarolynSteel_2009G@310.43:312.45 FEED ITSELF
CarolynSteel_2009G@312.93:321.80 ANSWER IS WHAT I CALL ANCIENT FOOD MILES BASICALLY ROME HAD ACCESS TO THE SEA WHICH MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR IT TO IMPORT FOOD FROM A VERY LONG WAY AWAY
CarolynSteel_2009G@322.08:331.32 THIS IS THE ONLY WAY IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DO THIS IN THE ANCIENT WORLD BECAUSE IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO TRANSPORT FOOD OVER ROADS WHICH WERE ROUGH AND THE FOOD OBVIOUSLY WENT OFF VERY QUICKLY
CarolynSteel_2009G@331.80:338.73 SO ROME EFFECTIVELY WAGED WAR ON PLACES LIKE CARTHAGE AND EGYPT JUST TO GET ITS PAWS ON THEIR GRAIN RESERVES
CarolynSteel_2009G@339.05:346.13 IN FACT YOU COULD SAY THAT THE EXPANSION OF THE EMPIRE WAS REALLY SORT OF ONE LONG DRAWN OUT MILITARIZED SHOPPING SPREE
CarolynSteel_2009G@349.77:360.12 HAVE TO MENTION THIS ROME IN FACT AT ONE STAGE I THINK THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY SO ROME SHAPED ITS HINTERLAND THROUGH ITS APPETITE
CarolynSteel_2009G@360.70:372.34 BUT THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT THE OTHER THING ALSO HAPPENED IN THE PRE INDUSTRIAL WORLD IF WE LOOK AT A MAP OF LONDON IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WE CAN SEE THAT ITS GRAIN WHICH IS COMING IN FROM THE THAMES ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THIS MAP
CarolynSteel_2009G@372.80:380.01 SO THE GRAIN MARKETS WERE TO THE SOUTH OF THE CITY AND THE ROADS LEADING UP FROM THEM TO CHEAPSIDE WHICH WAS THE MAIN MARKET
CarolynSteel_2009G@381.21:388.60 GRAIN MARKETS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE NAME OF ONE OF THOSE STREETS BREAD STREET YOU CAN TELL WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE THREE HUNDRED YEARS
CarolynSteel_2009G@389.80:403.06 THE SAME OF COURSE WAS TRUE FOR FISH FISH WAS OF COURSE COMING IN BY RIVER AS WELL SAME THING AND OF COURSE BILLINGSGATE FAMOUSLY WAS LONDON'S FISH MARKET OPERATING ON SITE HERE UNTIL THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHICH IS EXTRAORDINARY REALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT
CarolynSteel_2009G@411.99:418.74 THIS IS ANOTHER THING ABOUT FOOD IN CITIES ONCE ITS ROOTS INTO THE CITY ARE ESTABLISHED THEY VERY RARELY MOVE MEAT
CarolynSteel_2009G@418.89:429.29 IS A VERY DIFFERENT STORY BECAUSE OF COURSE ANIMALS COULD WALK INTO THE CITY SO MUCH OF LONDON'S MEAT WAS COMING FROM THE NORTHWEST FROM SCOTLAND AND WALES SO IT WAS COMING IN
CarolynSteel_2009G@429.69:441.27 AND ARRIVING AT THE CITY AT THE NORTHWEST WHICH IS WHY SMITHFIELD LONDON'S VERY FAMOUS MEAT MARKET WAS LOCATED UP THERE POULTRY WAS COMING IN FROM EAST ANGLIA AND SO ON TO THE NORTHEAST I FEEL A BIT LIKE A WEATHER WOMAN
CarolynSteel_2009G@443.01:451.59 AND SO THE BIRDS WERE COMING IN WITH THEIR FEET PROTECTED WITH LITTLE CANVAS SHOES AND THEN WHEN THEY HIT THE EASTERN END OF CHEAPSIDE
CarolynSteel_2009G@452.15:461.07 SOLD WHICH IS WHY IT'S CALLED POULTRY AND IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP OF ANY CITY BUILT BEFORE THE INDUSTRIAL AGE
CarolynSteel_2009G@461.42:473.39 YOU CAN TRACE FOOD COMING IN TO IT YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE HOW IT WAS PHYSICALLY SHAPED BY FOOD BOTH BY READING THE NAMES OF THE STREETS WHICH GIVE YOU A LOT OF CLUES FRIDAY STREET IN A PREVIOUS LIFE IS WHERE YOU WENT TO BUY YOUR FISH ON A FRIDAY
CarolynSteel_2009G@473.82:480.30 BUT ALSO YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE IT FULL OF FOOD BECAUSE THE STREETS AND THE PUBLIC SPACES WERE THE ONLY PLACES WHERE FOOD WAS BOUGHT
CarolynSteel_2009G@494.86:500.58 EARLIER SO THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY AN ORGANIC CITY PART OF AN ORGANIC CYCLE
CarolynSteel_2009G@512.26:522.57 ALL OF A SUDDEN THESE ANIMALS ARE NO LONGER WALKING INTO MARKET THEY'RE BEING SLAUGHTERED OUT OF SIGHT AND MIND SOMEWHERE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AND THEY'RE COMING INTO THE CITY BY RAIL AND THIS CHANGES
CarolynSteel_2009G@522.91:524.22 EVERYTHING
CarolynSteel_2009G@524.81:532.48 TO START OFF WITH IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THE FIRST TIME TO GROW CITIES REALLY ANY SIZE AND SHAPE IN ANY PLACE CITIES USED TO BE CONSTRAINED BY GEOGRAPHY
CarolynSteel_2009G@533.16:539.76 THEY USED TO HAVE TO GET THEIR FOOD THROUGH VERY DIFFICULT PHYSICAL MEANS ALL OF THE SUDDEN THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY EMANCIPATED FROM
CarolynSteel_2009G@540.98:549.28 AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THESE MAPS OF LONDON IN THE NINETY YEARS AFTER THE TRAINS CAME IT GOES FROM BEING A LITTLE BLOB THAT WAS QUITE EASY TO FEED
CarolynSteel_2009G@549.58:558.38 BY ANIMALS COMING IN ON FOOT AND SO ON TO A LARGE SPLURGE THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO FEED WITH ANYBODY ON FOOT EITHER ANIMALS OR PEOPLE
CarolynSteel_2009G@559.23:568.74 AND OF COURSE THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING AFTER THE TRAINS CAME CARS AND REALLY THIS MARKS THE END OF THIS PROCESS IT'S THE FINAL EMANCIPATION OF THE CITY
CarolynSteel_2009G@569.05:582.65 FROM ANY APPARENT RELATIONSHIP WITH NATURE AT ALL AND THIS IS THE KIND OF CITY THAT'S DEVOID OF SMELL DEVOID OF MESS CERTAINLY DEVOID OF PEOPLE BECAUSE NOBODY WOULD HAVE DREAMED OF WALKING IN SUCH A LANDSCAPE IN FACT WHAT THEY DID TO GET FOOD WAS THEY GOT IN THEIR CARS
CarolynSteel_2009G@583.40:595.35 TO A BOX SOMEWHERE ON THE OUTSKIRTS CAME BACK WITH A WEEK 'S WORTH OF SHOPPING AND WONDERED WHAT ON EARTH TO DO WITH IT AND THIS REALLY IS THE MOMENT WHEN OUR RELATIONSHIP BOTH WITH FOOD AND CITIES CHANGES COMPLETELY
CarolynSteel_2009G@595.72:607.39 HERE WE HAVE FOOD THAT USED TO BE THE CENTER THE SOCIAL CORE OF THE CITY AT THE PERIPHERY IT USED TO BE A SOCIAL EVENT BUYING AND SELLING FOOD NOW IT'S ANONYMOUS WE USED TO COOK NOW WE JUST ADD WATER
CarolynSteel_2009G@608.82:616.63 A LITTLE BIT OF AN EGG IF YOU'RE MAKING A CAKE OR SOMETHING WE DON'T SMELL FOOD TO SEE IF IT'S OKAY TO EAT WE JUST
CarolynSteel_2009G@617.23:627.42 READ THE BACK OF A LABEL ON A PACKET AND WE DON'T VALUE FOOD WE DON'T TRUST IT SO INSTEAD OF TRUSTING IT WE FEAR IT AND INSTEAD OF VALUING IT WE THROW IT AWAY
CarolynSteel_2009G@628.51:635.40 ONE OF THE GREAT IRONIES OF MODERN FOOD SYSTEMS IS THAT THEY'VE MADE THE VERY THING THEY PROMISED TO MAKE EASIER MUCH HARDER
CarolynSteel_2009G@635.98:645.92 BY MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO BUILD CITIES ANYWHERE AND ANY PLACE THEY'VE ACTUALLY DISTANCED US FROM OUR MOST IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS THAT OF US AND NATURE
CarolynSteel_2009G@654.91:663.56 IT'S NOT A NEW QUESTION FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IT'S WHAT THOMAS MORE WAS ASKING HIMSELF THIS IS THE FRONTISPIECE OF HIS BOOK UTOPIA
CarolynSteel_2009G@663.72:671.03 AND IT WAS A SERIES OF SEMI INDEPENDENT CITY STATES IF THAT SOUNDS REMOTELY FAMILIAR A DAY 'S WALK FROM ONE ANOTHER WHERE EVERYONE WAS BASICALLY FARMING
CarolynSteel_2009G@671.72:678.57 AND GREW VEGETABLES IN THEIR BACK GARDENS AND ATE COMMUNAL MEALS TOGETHER AND SO ON AND I THINK YOU COULD ARGUE THAT FOOD IS A FUNDAMENTAL
CarolynSteel_2009G@702.40:715.29 IT EVEN GOT BUILT BUT NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS VISION THAT HOWARD HAD AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH THESE UTOPIAN IDEAS THAT THEY ARE UTOPIAN UTOPIA WAS ACTUALLY A WORD THAT THOMAS MOORE USED DELIBERATELY IT WAS A KIND OF
CarolynSteel_2009G@716.22:729.53 GOT A DOUBLE DERIVATION FROM THE GREEK IT CAN EITHER MEAN A GOOD PLACE OR NO PLACE BECAUSE IT'S AN IDEAL IT'S AN IMAGINARY THING WE CAN'T HAVE IT AND I THINK AS A CONCEPTUAL TOOL FOR THINKING ABOUT THE VERY DEEP PROBLEM OF HUMAN DWELLING
CarolynSteel_2009G@730.02:741.56 THAT MAKES IT NOT MUCH USE SO I'VE COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE WHICH IS SITOPIA FROM THE ANCIENT GREEK SITOS FOR FOOD AND TOPOS FOR PLACE I BELIEVE WE ALREADY LIVE IN SITOPIA
CarolynSteel_2009G@741.83:755.22 WE LIVE IN A WORLD SHAPED BY FOOD AND IF WE REALIZE THAT WE CAN USE FOOD AS A REALLY POWERFUL TOOL A CONCEPTUAL TOOL DESIGN TOOL TO SHAPE THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY SO IF WE WERE TO DO THAT WHAT MIGHT SITOPIA LOOK LIKE
CarolynSteel_2009G@756.67:769.91 I THINK IT LOOKS A BIT LIKE THIS I HAVE TO USE THIS SLIDE IT'S JUST THE LOOK ON THE FACE OF THE DOG BUT ANYWAY THIS IS IT'S FOOD AT THE CENTER OF LIFE AT THE CENTER OF FAMILY LIFE BEING CELEBRATED BEING ENJOYED PEOPLE TAKING TIME FOR IT
CarolynSteel_2009G@770.47:779.23 THIS IS WHERE FOOD SHOULD BE IN OUR SOCIETY BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE SCENES LIKE THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE THIS BY THE WAY THESE CAN BE MEN AS WELL
CarolynSteel_2009G@803.50:812.02 OF THE SOCIAL LIFE OF THE CITY BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE THIS KIND OF PLACE FOOD THAT IS GROWN LOCALLY AND ALSO IS PART OF THE LANDSCAPE AND IS NOT JUST A
CarolynSteel_2009G@822.64:833.64 AND THIS IS A COMMUNITY PROJECT I VISITED RECENTLY IN TORONTO IT'S A GREENHOUSE WHERE KIDS GET TOLD ALL ABOUT FOOD AND GROWING THEIR OWN FOOD HERE IS A PLANT CALLED KEVIN OR MAYBE IT'S
CarolynSteel_2009G@843.79:854.97 SO SITOPIA FOR ME IS REALLY WAY OF SEEING IT'S BASICALLY RECOGNIZING THAT SITOPIA ALREADY EXISTS IN LITTLE POCKETS EVERYWHERE THE TRICK IS TO JOIN THEM UP TO USE FOOD AS A WAY OF
CarolynSteel_2009G@856.45:865.39 AND IF WE DO THAT WE'RE GOING TO STOP SEEING CITIES AS BIG METROPOLITAN UNPRODUCTIVE BLOBS LIKE THIS WE'RE GOING TO SEE THEM MORE LIKE THIS AS PART OF THE
CarolynSteel_2009G@879.05:886.59 WHICH IS WHY I THINK THIS IMAGE JUST SUMS UP FOR ME THE KIND OF THINKING WE NEED TO BE DOING IT'S A RECONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE WAY FOOD SHAPES OUR
CarolynSteel_2009G@887.52:895.89 THE BEST IMAGE I KNOW OF THIS IS FROM SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO IT'S AMBROGIO LORENZETTI 'S ALLEGORY OF GOOD GOVERNMENT IT'S ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE
CarolynSteel_2009G@897.13:903.47 AND I THINK THE MESSAGE OF THIS IS VERY CLEAR IF THE CITY LOOKS AFTER THE COUNTRY THE COUNTRY WILL LOOK AFTER THE CITY
CarolynSteel_2009G@904.01:913.57 AND I WANT US TO ASK NOW WHAT WOULD AMBROGIO LORENZETTI PAINT IF HE PAINTED THIS IMAGE TODAY WHAT WOULD AN ALLEGORY OF GOOD GOVERNMENT LOOK LIKE TODAY
CarolynSteel_2009G@913.95:921.60 I THINK IT'S AN URGENT QUESTION IT'S ONE WE HAVE TO ASK AND WE HAVE TO START ANSWERING WE KNOW WE ARE WHAT WE EAT
CarolynSteel_2009G@922.22:931.37 WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT THE WORLD IS ALSO WHAT WE EAT BUT IF WE TAKE THAT IDEA WE CAN USE FOOD AS A REALLY POWERFUL TOOL TO SHAPE THE WORLD BETTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
