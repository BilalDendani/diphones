DavidPizarro_2012X IT IT SORT OF ENDED ABRUPTLY WHEN SHE WAS EXECUTED
DavidPizarro_2012X SO WOMEN FLOCKED TO HER
DavidPizarro_2012X IN ORDER TO MURDER THEIR HUSBANDS IT TURNS OUT THAT POISONERS WERE A VALUED AND FEARED GROUP
DavidPizarro_2012X BECAUSE POISONING A HUMAN BEING IS A QUITE DIFFICULT THING
DavidPizarro_2012X THE REASON IS WE HAVE SORT OF A BUILT IN POISON DETECTOR YOU CAN SEE THIS AS EARLY AS EVEN IN NEWBORN INFANTS IF YOU ARE WILLING TO DO THIS YOU CAN TAKE A COUPLE OF DROPS OF A BITTER SUBSTANCE OR A SOUR SUBSTANCE AND YOU 'LL SEE THAT FACE THE TONGUE STICK OUT THE WRINKLED NOSE AS IF THEY 'RE TRYING TO GET RID OF WHAT 'S IN THEIR MOUTH
DavidPizarro_2012X THIS REACTION EXPANDS INTO ADULTHOOD AND BECOMES SORT OF A FULL BLOWN DISGUST RESPONSE NO LONGER JUST ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE 'RE ABOUT TO BE POISONED
DavidPizarro_2012X THIS EMOTION OF DISGUST NOW INFLUENCES OUR MORAL BELIEFS AND EVEN OUR DEEPLY HELD POLITICAL INTUITIONS WHY THIS MIGHT BE THE CASE
DavidPizarro_2012X WE CAN UNDERSTAND THIS PROCESS BY UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EMOTIONS IN GENERAL SO THE BASIC HUMAN EMOTIONS THOSE KINDS OF EMOTIONS THAT WE SHARE WITH ALL OTHER HUMAN BEINGS
DavidPizarro_2012X THIS PHOTO TAKEN JUST BEFORE HIS DEATH
DavidPizarro_2012X JUST LIKE FEAR OFFERS US PROTECTIVE BENEFITS DISGUST SEEMS TO DO THE SAME THING EXCEPT FOR WHAT DISGUST DOES IS KEEPS US AWAY FROM NOT THINGS THAT MIGHT EAT US OR HEIGHTS BUT RATHER THINGS THAT MIGHT POISON US OR GIVE US DISEASE AND MAKE US SICK
DavidPizarro_2012X SO ONE OF THE FEATURES OF DISGUST THAT MAKES IT SUCH AN INTERESTING EMOTION IS THAT IT 'S VERY VERY EASY TO ELICIT IN FACT MORE SO THAN PROBABLY ANY OF THE OTHER BASIC EMOTIONS AND SO I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THAT WITH A COUPLE OF IMAGES I CAN PROBABLY MAKE YOU FEEL DISGUST SO TURN AWAY I 'LL TELL YOU WHEN YOU CAN TURN BACK
DavidPizarro_2012X DARWIN WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATE THE HUMAN EMOTIONS AND HE POINTED TO
DavidPizarro_2012X THE UNIVERSAL NATURE AND THE STRENGTH OF THE DISGUST RESPONSE THIS IS AN ANECDOTE FROM HIS TRAVELS IN SOUTH AMERICA IN TIERRO DEL FUEGO A NATIVE TOUCHED WITH HIS FINGER SOME COLD PRESERVED MEAT WHILE I WAS EATING AND PLAINLY SHOWED DISGUST AT ITS SOFTNESS WHILST I FELT UTTER DISGUST AT MY FOOD BEING TOUCHED BY A NAKED SAVAGE
DavidPizarro_2012X THAT ARE HARD TO JETTISON OVERNIGHT
DavidPizarro_2012X THIS MAKES IT VERY USEFUL AS A STRATEGY IF YOU WANT TO CONVINCE SOMEBODY THAT AN OBJECT OR AN INDIVIDUAL OR AN ENTIRE SOCIAL GROUP IS DISGUSTING AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED
DavidPizarro_2012X THE PHILOSOPHER MARTHA NUSSBAUM POINTS THIS OUT IN THIS QUOTE THUS THROUGHOUT HISTORY CERTAIN DISGUST PROPERTIES SLIMINESS BAD SMELL STICKINESS DECAY FOULNESS HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY AND MONOTONOUSLY BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH JEWS WOMEN HOMOSEXUALS UNTOUCHABLES LOWER CLASS PEOPLE ALL OF THOSE ARE IMAGINED AS TAINTED BY THE DIRT OF THE BODY
DavidPizarro_2012X THIS IS FROM AN ANTI GAY WEBSITE
DavidPizarro_2012X WHERE THEY SAID GAYS ARE WORTHY OF DEATH FOR THEIR VILE SEX PRACTICES THEY 'RE LIKE DOGS EATING THEIR OWN VOMIT AND SOWS WALLOWING IN THEIR OWN FECES THESE ARE DISGUST PROPERTIES THAT ARE TRYING TO BE DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE SOCIAL GROUP THAT YOU SHOULD NOT LIKE WHEN WE WERE FIRST INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF DISGUST IN MORAL JUDGMENT
DavidPizarro_2012X ONE OF THE THINGS WE BECAME INTERESTED IN
DavidPizarro_2012X WAS WHETHER OR NOT THESE SORTS OF APPEALS ARE MORE LIKELY TO WORK IN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MORE EASILY DISGUSTED SO WHILE DISGUST ALONG WITH THE OTHER BASIC EMOTIONS ARE UNIVERSAL PHENOMENA IT JUST REALLY IS TRUE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE EASIER TO DISGUST THAN OTHERS YOU COULD PROBABLY SEE IT IN THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS WHEN I SHOWED YOU THOSE DISGUSTING IMAGES
DavidPizarro_2012X THE WAY THAT WE MEASURED THIS WAS BY A SCALE THAT WAS CONSTRUCTED BY SOME OTHER PSYCHOLOGISTS THAT SIMPLY ASKED PEOPLE ACROSS A WIDE VARIETY OF SITUATIONS HOW LIKELY THEY ARE TO FEEL DISGUST SO HERE ARE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES
DavidPizarro_2012X EVEN IF I WERE HUNGRY I WOULD NOT DRINK A BOWL OF MY FAVORITE SOUP IF IT HAD BEEN STIRRED BY A USED BUT THOROUGHLY WASHED FLY SWATTER DO YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE
DavidPizarro_2012X IF YOU ASK ENOUGH OF THESE YOU CAN GET A GENERAL OVERALL SCORE OF DISGUST SENSITIVITY IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS SCORE
DavidPizarro_2012X IS ACTUALLY MEANINGFUL WHEN YOU BRING PEOPLE INTO THE LABORATORY AND YOU ASK THEM
DavidPizarro_2012X GROSS YOUR SCORE ON THAT SCALE ACTUALLY PREDICTS WHETHER OR NOT YOU 'LL BE WILLING TO ENGAGE IN THOSE BEHAVIORS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE SET OUT TO COLLECT DATA ON THIS AND ASSOCIATE IT WITH POLITICAL OR MORAL BELIEFS WE FOUND A GENERAL PATTERN
DavidPizarro_2012X THIS IS WITH THE PSYCHOLOGISTS YOEL INBAR
DavidPizarro_2012X THIS DATA SET ALSO ALLOWED US TO STATISTICALLY CONTROL FOR A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE KNEW WERE BOTH RELATED TO POLITICAL ORIENTATION AND TO DISGUST SENSITIVITY
DavidPizarro_2012X SO WE WERE ABLE TO CONTROL FOR GENDER AGE INCOME EDUCATION EVEN BASIC PERSONALITY VARIABLES AND THE RESULT STAYS THE SAME WHEN WE ACTUALLY LOOKED
DavidPizarro_2012X SO IT NOT ONLY PREDICTED SELF REPORTED POLITICAL ORIENTATION BUT ACTUAL VOTING BEHAVIOR AND ALSO WE WERE ABLE
DavidPizarro_2012X WITH THIS SAMPLE TO LOOK ACROSS THE WORLD IN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WE ASKED THE SAME QUESTIONS
DavidPizarro_2012X AND AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE COUNTRIES COLLAPSED INTO TEN DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS NO MATTER WHERE YOU LOOK WHAT THIS IS PLOTTING IS THE SIZE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DISGUST SENSITIVITY AND POLITICAL ORIENTATION AND NO MATTER WHERE WE LOOKED WE SAW A VERY SIMILAR EFFECT
DavidPizarro_2012X OTHER LABS HAVE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THIS AS WELL USING DIFFERENT MEASURES OF DISGUST SENSITIVITY SO RATHER THAN ASKING PEOPLE HOW EASILY DISGUSTED THEY ARE THEY HOOK PEOPLE UP TO PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES IN THIS CASE SKIN CONDUCTANCE AND WHAT THEY 'VE DEMONSTRATED IS THAT PEOPLE WHO REPORT BEING MORE POLITICALLY CONSERVATIVE
DavidPizarro_2012X ARE ALSO MORE PHYSIOLOGICALLY AROUSED WHEN YOU SHOW THEM DISGUSTING IMAGES LIKE THE ONES THAT I SHOWED YOU
DavidPizarro_2012X INTERESTINGLY WHAT THEY ALSO SHOWED IN A FINDING THAT WE KEPT GETTING IN OUR PREVIOUS STUDIES AS WELL
DavidPizarro_2012X WAS THAT ONE OF THE STRONGEST INFLUENCES HERE IS THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE VERY DISGUST SENSITIVE NOT ONLY ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT BEING POLITICALLY CONSERVATIVE BUT THEY 'RE ALSO VERY MUCH MORE OPPOSED TO GAY MARRIAGE AND HOMOSEXUALITY AND PRETTY MUCH A LOT OF THE SOCIO MORAL ISSUES IN THE SEXUAL DOMAIN
DavidPizarro_2012X SO PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL PREDICTED IN THIS STUDY ATTITUDES TOWARD GAY MARRIAGE
DavidPizarro_2012X ACTUALLY BRING PEOPLE INTO THE LAB AND DISGUST THEM AND COMPARE THEM TO A CONTROL GROUP THAT HASN 'T BEEN DISGUSTED IT TURNS OUT THAT OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS A NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS HAVE DONE THIS
DavidPizarro_2012X AND BY AND LARGE THE RESULTS HAVE ALL BEEN THE SAME THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE FEELING DISGUST THEIR ATTITUDES SHIFT TOWARDS THE RIGHT OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM TOWARD MORE MORAL CONSERVATISM AS WELL SO THIS IS WHETHER YOU USE A FOUL ODOR A BAD TASTE
DavidPizarro_2012X FROM FILM CLIPS FROM POST HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS OF DISGUST IMAGES LIKE THE ONES I 'VE SHOWN YOU EVEN JUST REMINDING PEOPLE THAT DISEASE IS PREVALENT AND THEY SHOULD BE WARY OF IT AND WASH UP RIGHT TO KEEP CLEAN THESE ALL HAVE SIMILAR EFFECTS ON JUDGMENT
DavidPizarro_2012X LET ME JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE FROM A RECENT STUDY THAT WE CONDUCTED
DavidPizarro_2012X AND WE EITHER MADE THE ROOM SMELL GROSS OR NOT
DavidPizarro_2012X QUESTIONNAIRES NEXT TO A SIGN THAT REMINDED THEM TO WASH THEIR HANDS AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT JUST TAKING A QUESTIONNAIRE NEXT
DavidPizarro_2012X TO THIS HAND SANITIZING REMINDER MADE INDIVIDUALS REPORT BEING MORE POLITICALLY CONSERVATIVE
DavidPizarro_2012X AND WHEN WE ASKED THEM A VARIETY OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RIGHTNESS OR WRONGNESS OF CERTAIN ACTS WHAT WE ALSO FOUND WAS THAT SIMPLY BEING REMINDED THAT THEY OUGHT TO WASH THEIR HANDS MADE THEM MORE MORALLY CONSERVATIVE
DavidPizarro_2012X IN PARTICULAR WHEN WE ASKED THEM QUESTIONS ABOUT SORT OF TABOO BUT FAIRLY HARMLESS SEXUAL PRACTICES JUST BEING REMINDED THAT THEY OUGHT TO WASH THEIR HANDS MADE THEM THINK THAT THEY WERE MORE MORALLY WRONG LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT I MEAN BY HARMLESS BUT TABOO SEXUAL PRACTICE
DavidPizarro_2012X WE GAVE THEM SCENARIOS ONE OF THEM SAID A MAN IS HOUSE SITTING FOR HIS GRANDMOTHER WHEN HIS GRANDMOTHER 'S AWAY HE HAS SEX WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND ON HIS GRANDMA 'S BED IN ANOTHER ONE WE SAID A WOMAN ENJOYS MASTURBATING WITH HER FAVORITE TEDDY BEAR CUDDLED NEXT TO HER
DavidPizarro_2012X THE WAY YOU THINK IN THE CASE OF DISGUST WHAT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE SURPRISING IS THE SCOPE OF THIS INFLUENCE IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE AND IT 'S A VERY GOOD EMOTION FOR US TO HAVE THAT DISGUST WOULD MAKE ME CHANGE THE WAY THAT I PERCEIVE THE PHYSICAL WORLD WHENEVER CONTAMINATION IS POSSIBLE
DavidPizarro_2012X IT MAKES LESS SENSE THAT AN EMOTION THAT WAS BUILT TO PREVENT ME FROM INGESTING POISON SHOULD PREDICT WHO I 'M GOING TO VOTE FOR IN THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
DavidPizarro_2012X THE QUESTION OF WHETHER DISGUST OUGHT TO INFLUENCE OUR MORAL AND POLITICAL JUDGMENTS CERTAINLY HAS TO BE COMPLEX AND MIGHT DEPEND ON EXACTLY WHAT JUDGMENTS WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT AND AS A SCIENTIST WE HAVE TO CONCLUDE SOMETIMES THAT THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS JUST ILL EQUIPPED TO ANSWER THESE SORTS OF QUESTIONS
