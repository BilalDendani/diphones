JamesHowardKunstler_2004 THE IMMERSIVE UGLINESS OF OUR EVERYDAY ENVIRONMENTS IN AMERICA
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 IS ENTROPY MADE VISIBLE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 WE CAN'T OVERESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF DESPAIR THAT WE ARE GENERATING
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 WITH PLACES LIKE THIS
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 A LOT OF WAYS YOU CAN DESCRIBE THIS YOU KNOW I LIKE TO CALL IT THE NATIONAL AUTOMOBILE SLUM YOU CAN CALL IT SUBURBAN SPRAWL
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO CALL IT THE GREATEST MISALLOCATION OF RESOURCES IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 YOU CAN CALL IT A TECHNOSIS EXTERNALITY CLUSTERFUCK
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 AND IT'S A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM FOR US THE OUTSTANDING THE SALIENT PROBLEM ABOUT THIS
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 FOR US IS THAT THESE ARE PLACES THAT ARE NOT WORTH CARING ABOUT
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 TALK ABOUT THAT SOME MORE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 A SENSE OF PLACE YOUR ABILITY TO CREATE PLACES THAT ARE MEANINGFUL
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 AND PLACES OF QUALITY AND CHARACTER DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON YOUR ABILITY TO DEFINE SPACE WITH BUILDINGS AND TO EMPLOY
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 THE VOCABULARIES GRAMMARS SYNTAXES RHYTHMS AND PATTERNS OF ARCHITECTURE IN ORDER TO INFORM US WHO WE ARE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 THE PUBLIC REALM
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 IT IS THE DWELLING PLACE OF OUR CIVILIZATION AND OUR CIVIC LIFE AND IT IS THE PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION OF THE COMMON GOOD
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 AND WHEN YOU DEGRADE THE PUBLIC REALM YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY DEGRADE THE QUALITY OF YOUR CIVIC LIFE AND THE CHARACTER OF ALL THE ENACTMENTS OF YOUR PUBLIC LIFE AND COMMUNAL LIFE THAT TAKE PLACE THERE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 THE PUBLIC REALM COMES MOSTLY IN THE FORM OF THE STREET
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 YOUR ABILITY TO DEFINE SPACE AND TO CREATE PLACES THAT ARE WORTH CARING ABOUT ALL COMES FROM A BODY OF CULTURE THAT WE CALL THE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 TO INFORM US NOT ONLY WHERE WE ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 BUT IT HAS TO INFORM US WHERE WE ARE IN OUR CULTURE WHERE WE'VE COME FROM WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE WE ARE AND IT NEEDS TO BY DOING THAT
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 IT NEEDS TO AFFORD US A GLIMPSE TO WHERE WE'RE GOING IN ORDER TO ALLOW US TO DWELL IN A HOPEFUL PRESENT
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 AND IF THERE IS ONE TREMENDOUS IF THERE IS ONE GREAT CATASTROPHE ABOUT THE PLACES THAT WE'VE BUILT THE HUMAN ENVIRONMENTS WE'VE MADE FOR OURSELVES
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS IT IS THAT IT HAS DEPRIVED US OF THE ABILITY TO LIVE IN A HOPEFUL PRESENT
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 THE ENVIRONMENTS WE ARE LIVING IN MORE TYPICALLY ARE LIKE THESE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 BE THE ASTEROID BELT OF ARCHITECTURAL GARBAGE TWO MILES NORTH OF MY TOWN AND REMEMBER TO CREATE A PLACE OF CHARACTER AND QUALITY YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DEFINE SPACE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 SO HOW IS THAT BEING ACCOMPLISHED HERE IF YOU STAND ON THE APRON OF THE WAL MART OVER HERE AND TRY TO LOOK AT THE TARGET STORE OVER HERE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 YOU CAN'T SEE IT BECAUSE OF THE CURVATURE OF THE EARTH
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 WE HAVE ABOUT YOU KNOW THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND PLACES THAT ARE NOT WORTH CARING ABOUT IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY WHEN WE HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM WE'RE GONNA HAVE A NATION THAT'S NOT WORTH DEFENDING
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 AND I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE OVER IN PLACES LIKE IRAQ SPILLING THEIR BLOOD IN THE SAND
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 AND ASK YOURSELF WHAT IS THEIR LAST THOUGHT OF HOME I HOPE IT'S NOT THE CURB CUT BETWEEN THE CHUCK E CHEESE AND THE TARGET STORE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR AMERICANS
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 TO BE SPILLING THEIR BLOOD FOR WE NEED BETTER PLACES IN THIS COUNTRY
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 SPACE IT'S A PLACE WORTH CARING ABOUT
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 IT'S WELL DEFINED IT IS EMPHATICALLY AN OUTDOOR PUBLIC ROOM IT HAS SOMETHING THAT IS TERRIBLY IMPORTANT IT HAS WHAT'S CALLED AN ACTIVE AND PERMEABLE MEMBRANE AROUND THE EDGE THAT'S A FANCY WAY OF SAYING
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 IT'S GOT SHOPS BARS BISTROS DESTINATIONS THINGS GO IN AND OUT OF IT IT'S PERMEABLE THE BEER
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 GOES IN AND OUT THE WAITRESSES GO IN AND OUT AND THAT ACTIVATES THE CENTER OF THIS PLACE AND MAKES IT A PLACE THAT PEOPLE WANT TO HANG OUT IN YOU KNOW IN THESE PLACES IN OTHER CULTURES
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 PEOPLE JUST GO BECAUSE IT'S PLEASURABLE TO BE THERE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 BUT THIS IS HOW WE DO IT IN THE UNITED STATES PROBABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC SPACE FAILURE IN AMERICA DESIGNED BY THE LEADING ARCHITECTS OF THE DAY
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 HARRY COBB AND I M PEI BOSTON CITY HALL PLAZA A PUBLIC PLACE SO DISMAL THAT THE WINOS DON'T EVEN WANT TO GO THERE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 AND WE CAN'T FIX IT BECAUSE I M PEI 'S STILL ALIVE AND EVERY YEAR HARVARD AND M I T HAVE A JOINT COMMITTEE TO REPAIR IT AND EVERY YEAR THEY FAIL TO BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO HURT I M PEI 'S FEELINGS
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL OK
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 ABOUT GOING DOWN THIS BLOCK
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 THIS IS THE BACK OF BOSTON CITY HALL THE MOST IMPORTANT YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT CIVIC BUILDING IN ALBANY EXCUSE ME IN BOSTON
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 THE VOCABULARIES AND GRAMMARS THAT ARE COMING FROM THIS BUILDING AND HOW IS IT INFORMING US ABOUT WHO WE ARE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 THIS IN FACT WOULD BE A BETTER BUILDING IF WE PUT MOSAIC PORTRAITS OF JOSEF STALIN POL POT
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 SADDAM HUSSEIN AND ALL THE OTHER GREAT DESPOTS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY ON THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING BECAUSE THEN WE'D HONESTLY BE SAYING WHAT THE BUILDING IS REALLY COMMUNICATING TO US YOU KNOW THAT IT'S A DESPOTIC BUILDING IT WANTS US TO FEEL LIKE TERMITES
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 THIS IS IT ON A SMALLER SCALE THE BACK OF THE CIVIC CENTER IN MY TOWN SARATOGA SPRINGS NEW YORK
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 THEY SHOUTED AT ME AND SAID IT WAS RAINING THAT DAY WHEN YOU TOOK THAT PICTURE BECAUSE THIS WAS PERCEIVED TO BE A WEATHER PROBLEM
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 YOU KNOW THIS IS A BUILDING DESIGNED LIKE A DVD PLAYER
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 POWER SUPPLY
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 YOU KNOW THESE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL JOBS FOR FIRMS RIGHT YOU KNOW WE HIRE FIRMS TO DESIGN THESE THINGS YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT WENT ON THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AT THE DESIGN MEETING YOU KNOW EIGHT HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 AND I MEAN WHAT WAS THE CONVERSATION THAT WAS GOING ON THERE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THE LAST WORD WAS WHAT THE LAST SENTENCE WAS OF THAT MEETING IT WAS
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 SO I WENT BACK ON THE NICEST DAY OF THE YEAR JUST TO YOU KNOW JUST SOME REALITY TESTING AND IN FACT HE WILL NOT EVEN GO DOWN THERE BECAUSE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 IT'S NOT INTERESTING ENOUGH FOR HIS CLIENTS YOU KNOW THE BURGLARS THE MUGGERS
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 IT'S NOT CIVICALLY RICH ENOUGH FOR THEM TO GO DOWN THERE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 OK THE PATTERN OF MAIN STREET USA IN FACT THIS PATTERN OF BUILDING DOWNTOWN BLOCKS ALL OVER THE WORLD IS FAIRLY UNIVERSAL IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED BUILDINGS MORE THAN ONE STORY HIGH
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 BUILT OUT TO THE SIDEWALK EDGE SO THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE YOU KNOW ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE CAN GET INTO THE BUILDING OTHER ACTIVITIES ARE ALLOWED TO
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 UPSTAIRS YOU KNOW APARTMENTS OFFICES AND SO ON YOU MAKE PROVISION FOR THIS ACTIVITY CALLED SHOPPING ON THE GROUND FLOOR THEY HAVEN'T LEARNED THAT IN MONTEREY
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 YOU GO OUT TO THE CORNER RIGHT AT THE MAIN INTERSECTION RIGHT IN FRONT OF THIS CONFERENCE CENTER YOU'LL SEE AN INTERSECTION WITH FOUR BLANK WALLS ON EVERY CORNER
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 REALLY INCREDIBLE ANYWAY THIS IS HOW YOU COMPOSE AND ASSEMBLE A DOWNTOWN BUSINESS BUILDING AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN IN GLENS FALLS NEW YORK WHEN WE TRIED TO DO IT AGAIN
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 OK THAT COMPLETELY DESTROYS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BUSINESS AND THE SIDEWALK WHERE THE THEORETICAL PEDESTRIANS ARE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 BE THERE AS LONG AS THIS IS IN THAT CONDITION THEN BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RETAIL IS DESTROYED WE POP A HANDICAPPED RAMP ON THAT AND THEN TO MAKE OURSELVES FEEL BETTER WE PUT A NATURE BAND AID IN FRONT OF IT
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 AND IN FACT THE REMEDY FOR WOUNDED AND MUTILATED URBANISM IS GOOD URBANISM GOOD BUILDINGS NOT JUST
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 FLOWER BEDS NOT JUST CARTOONS OF THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH WE HAVE TO DO GOOD BUILDINGS
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 THE STREET TREES HAVE REALLY FOUR JOBS TO DO AND THAT'S IT TO SPATIALLY DENOTE THE PEDESTRIAN REALM TO PROTECT THE PEDESTRIANS FROM THE VEHICLES IN THE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 TO FILTER THE SUNLIGHT ONTO THE SIDEWALK AND TO SOFTEN THE HARDSCAPE OF THE BUILDINGS AND TO CREATE A CEILING A VAULTED CEILING OVER THE STREET AT ITS BEST
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 AND THAT'S IT THOSE ARE THE FOUR JOBS OF THE STREET TREES THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A CARTOON OF THE NORTH WOODS THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 LAST OF THE MOHICANS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE FIASCO OF SUBURBIA IS THAT IT DESTROYED OUR
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 BY DRAGGING THE COUNTRY INTO THE CITY WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF US ARE TRYING TO DO ALL THE TIME HERE YOU SEE ON A SMALL SCALE THE MOTHERSHIP HAS LANDED R TWO D TWO AND C THREE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 HAVE STEPPED OUT TO TEST THE BARK MULCH TO SEE IF THEY CAN INHABIT THIS PLANET
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 A LOT OF THIS COMES FROM THE FACT THAT THE INDUSTRIAL CITY IN AMERICA
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 TRAUMA THAT WE DEVELOPED THIS TREMENDOUS AVERSION FOR THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE CITY CITY LIFE AND EVERYTHING CONNECTED WITH IT
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 AND SO WHAT YOU SEE FAIRLY EARLY IN THE MID NINETEENTH CENTURY IS THIS IDEA THAT WE NOW HAVE TO HAVE AN ANTIDOTE TO THE INDUSTRIAL CITY WHICH IS GOING TO BE LIFE IN THE COUNTRY FOR EVERYBODY
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 WHICH ALLOWS PEOPLE TO ENJOY THE AMENITY OF THE CITY BUT TO RETURN TO THE COUNTRYSIDE EVERY NIGHT AND BELIEVE ME THERE WERE NO WAL MARTS OR CONVENIENCE STORES OUT THERE THEN
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 SO IT REALLY WAS A FORM OF COUNTRY LIVING BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS OF COURSE IT MUTATES OVER THE NEXT EIGHTY YEARS AND IT TURNS INTO SOMETHING RATHER INSIDIOUS
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 IT BECOMES A CARTOON OF A COUNTRY HOUSE IN A CARTOON OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT'S THE GREAT NON ARTICULATED AGONY
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 OF SUBURBIA AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT IT LENDS ITSELF TO RIDICULE BECAUSE IT HASN'T DELIVERED WHAT IT'S BEEN PROMISING FOR HALF A CENTURY NOW AND THESE ARE TYPICALLY THE KIND OF DWELLINGS WE FIND THERE YOU KNOW BASICALLY A HOUSE WITH
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 ON THE SIDE BECAUSE THIS HOUSE WANTS TO STATE EMPHATICALLY I 'M A LITTLE CABIN IN THE WOODS THERE'S NOTHING ON EITHER SIDE OF ME I DON'T HAVE ANY EYES ON THE SIDE OF MY HEAD I CAN'T
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 NOBODY 'S GONNA BE USING THAT THIS IS REALLY IN FACT A TELEVISION BROADCASTING A SHOW TWENTY FOUR SEVEN CALLED WE 'RE NORMAL
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 WE'RE NORMAL WE'RE NORMAL WE'RE NORMAL WE'RE NORMAL WE'RE NORMAL PLEASE RESPECT US WE'RE NORMAL WE'RE NORMAL WE'RE NORMAL
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 BUT WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THESE HOUSES YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT LITTLE SKIPPY IS LOADING HIS UZI DOWN HERE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 GETTING READY FOR
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 WE KNOW THAT HEATHER HIS SISTER HEATHER FOURTEEN YEARS OLD IS TURNING TRICKS UP HERE TO SUPPORT HER DRUG HABIT
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 BECAUSE THESE PLACES THESE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 ARE INDUCING IMMENSE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN CHILDREN AND THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH MEDICATION SO THEY TAKE THE FIRST ONE THAT COMES ALONG OFTEN
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 THESE ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR AMERICANS THESE ARE THE SCHOOLS WE ARE SENDING THEM TO THE HANNIBAL LECTER CENTRAL SCHOOL
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 LAS VEGAS NEVADA
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 A REAL SCHOOL YOU KNOW BUT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A NOTION THAT IF YOU LET THE INMATES OF THIS THING OUT THAT THEY WOULD SNATCH A MOTORIST OFF THE STREET AND EAT HIS LIVER
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 EVERY EFFORT IS MADE TO KEEP THEM WITHIN THE BUILDING NOTICE THAT NATURE IS PRESENT
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 HAVE TO CHANGE THIS BEHAVIOR WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE ENTERING AN EPOCHAL PERIOD OF CHANGE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 IN THE WORLD AND CERTAINLY IN AMERICA THE PERIOD THAT WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BY THE END OF THE CHEAP OIL ERA IT IS GOING TO CHANGE ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING CHRIS
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 ASKED ME NOT TO GO ON TOO LONG ABOUT THIS AND I WON 'T EXCEPT TO SAY THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A HYDROGEN ECONOMY FORGET IT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DOWN SCALE RE SCALE AND RE SIZE VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING WE DO IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE CAN'T START SOON ENOUGH TO DO IT
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE CLOSER TO WHERE WE WORK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE CLOSER TO EACH OTHER WE'RE GOING HAVE TO GROW MORE FOOD CLOSER TO WHERE WE LIVE THE AGE OF THE THREE THOUSAND MILE CAESAR SALAD IS COMING TO AN END
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 GOING TO HAVE TO WE HAVE A RAILROAD SYSTEM THAT THE BULGARIANS WOULD BE ASHAMED OF WE GOTTA DO BETTER THAN THAT AND WE SHOULD HAVE STARTED TWO DAYS BEFORE YESTERDAY
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 WE ARE FORTUNATE THAT THE NEW URBANISTS WERE THERE FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS EXCAVATING ALL THAT INFORMATION THAT WAS THROWN IN THE GARBAGE BY OUR PARENTS GENERATION
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 SO THAT YOU KNOW THE RESIDENCES MAKE SENSE DEPLOYED IN RELATION TO THE PLACES OF BUSINESS OF CULTURE AND OF GOVERNANCE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 HAVE TO RE LEARN WHAT THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THESE THINGS ARE THE STREET THE BLOCK HOW TO COMPOSE PUBLIC SPACE THAT'S BOTH LARGE AND SMALL THE COURTYARD THE CIVIC SQUARE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 AND HOW TO REALLY MAKE USE OF THIS PROPERTY WE CAN SEE SOME OF THE FIRST IDEAS FOR RETRO FITTING SOME OF THE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 WE'RE GOING TO FIX THEM BY IMPOSING BACK ON THEM STREET AND BLOCK SYSTEMS AND RETURNING TO THE BUILDING LOT AS THE NORMAL INCREMENT OF DEVELOPMENT
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 AND IF WE'RE LUCKY THE RESULT WILL BE REVIVIFIED TOWN CENTERS AND NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERS IN OUR EXISTING TOWNS AND CITIES AND BY THE WAY
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 OUR TOWNS AND CITIES ARE WHERE THEY ARE AND GREW WHERE THEY WERE BECAUSE THEY OCCUPY ALL THE IMPORTANT SITES
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 AND MOST OF THEM ARE STILL GOING TO BE THERE ALTHOUGH THE SCALE OF THEM IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE DIMINISHED WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE RESCUED BY THE HYPER CAR WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE RESCUED BY ALTERNATIVE FUELS NO AMOUNT OR COMBINATION OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS IS GOING TO ALLOW US
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 TO CONTINUE RUNNING WHAT WE'RE RUNNING THE WAY WE'RE RUNNING IT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING VERY DIFFERENTLY AND AMERICA 'S NOT PREPARED WE ARE SLEEPWALKING INTO THE FUTURE WE'RE NOT READY FOR WHAT'S COMING AT US SO I URGE YOU
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 ALL TO DO WHAT YOU CAN LIFE IN THE MID TWENTY ONE ST CENTURY IS GOING TO BE ABOUT
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 BE PREPARED TO BE GOOD NEIGHBORS BE PREPARED TO FIND VOCATIONS THAT MAKE YOU USEFUL TO YOUR NEIGHBORS AND TO YOUR FELLOW CITIZENS ONE FINAL THING
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 OK CONSUMERS ARE DIFFERENT THAN CITIZENS CONSUMERS DO NOT HAVE OBLIGATIONS RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 TO THEIR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS AND AS LONG AS YOU'RE USING THAT WORD CONSUMER IN THE PUBLIC DISCUSSION YOU WILL BE DEGRADING THE QUALITY OF THE DISCUSSION WE'RE HAVING AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE BEING CLUELESS GOING INTO THIS VERY DIFFICULT FUTURE
JamesHowardKunstler_2004 THAT WE FACE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE GO OUT AND DO WHAT YOU CAN TO MAKE THIS A LAND FULL OF PLACES THAT ARE WORTH CARING ABOUT AND A NATION THAT WILL BE WORTH
