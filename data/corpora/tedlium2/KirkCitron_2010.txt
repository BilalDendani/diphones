KirkCitron_2010@16.57:30.39 WE ARE DROWNING IN NEWS REUTERS ALONE PUTS OUT THREE AND A HALF MILLION NEWS STORIES A YEAR THAT'S JUST ONE SOURCE MY QUESTION IS HOW MANY OF THOSE STORIES ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO MATTER IN THE LONG RUN
KirkCitron_2010@31.90:40.14 THAT'S THE IDEA BEHIND THE LONG NEWS IT'S A PROJECT BY THE LONG NOW FOUNDATION WHICH WAS FOUNDED BY TEDSTERS INCLUDING KEVIN KELLY AND STEWART BRAND
KirkCitron_2010@49.26:57.33 A LOT FALLS BY THE WAYSIDE IF YOU TAKE THE TOP STORIES FROM THE A P THIS LAST YEAR IS THIS GOING TO MATTER IN A DECADE
KirkCitron_2010@65.89:67.80 IS THIS GOING TO MATTER IN FIFTY OR ONE HUNDRED YEARS
KirkCitron_2010@73.24:85.18 BUT THE TOP STORY OF THIS PAST YEAR WAS THE ECONOMY AND I'M JUST BETTING THAT SOONER OR LATER THIS PARTICULAR RECESSION IS GOING TO BE OLD NEWS SO WHAT KIND OF STORIES MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR THE FUTURE
KirkCitron_2010@86.48:93.56 WELL LET 'S TAKE SOMEDAY LITTLE ROBOTS WILL GO THROUGH OUR BLOODSTREAMS FIXING THINGS

KirkCitron_2010@170.82:175.16 MY PICK FOR THE TOP LONG NEWS STORY OF THIS PAST YEAR WAS THIS ONE WATER FOUND ON THE MOON
KirkCitron_2010@184.09:190.17 MY POINT IS THIS IN THE LONG RUN SOME NEWS STORIES ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS
