JuanEnriquez_2007S IS NOT
JuanEnriquez_2007S GLOBAL WARMING
JuanEnriquez_2007S BIOENERGY IS SOMETHING WHICH SEEMS COUNTERINTUITIVE BIOENERGY IS OIL IT'S GAS
JuanEnriquez_2007S IT'S
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND PART OF BUILDING THAT BRIDGE TO THE FUTURE TO THE POINT WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE OCEANS IN A RATIONAL WAY OR PUT UP THESE GEO SPATIAL ORBITS
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND TO DO THAT YOU REALLY HAVE TO LOOK FIRST AT AGRICULTURE
JuanEnriquez_2007S SO WE'VE BEEN PLANTING STUFF FOR ELEVEN THOUSAND YEARS
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND IN THE MEASURE THAT WE PLANT STUFF WHAT WE LEARN FROM AGRICULTURE IS YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH PESTS YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH
JuanEnriquez_2007S THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SPREAD BEYOND THE NILE
JuanEnriquez_2007S POWER STUFF SO IRRIGATION MAKES A DIFFERENCE IRRIGATION STARTS TO MAKE YOU BE ALLOWED TO PLANT STUFF WHERE YOU WANT IT AS OPPOSED TO WHERE THE RIVERS FLOOD
JuanEnriquez_2007S YOU START GETTING THIS ORGANIC AGRICULTURE
JuanEnriquez_2007S YOU START PUTTING MACHINERY ONTO THIS STUFF
JuanEnriquez_2007S MACHINES AND WATER AND YOU GET LANDSCAPES THAT LOOK LIKE THIS AND THEN YOU GET SALES THAT LOOK LIKE
JuanEnriquez_2007S SO WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING IN AGRICULTURE IS YOU START OUT WITH SOMETHING THAT'S A REASONABLY NATURAL SYSTEM YOU START TAMING THAT NATURAL SYSTEM YOU PUT A LOT OF FORCE BEHIND THAT NATURAL SYSTEM YOU PUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF
JuanEnriquez_2007S UP WITH SYSTEMS THAT LOOK LIKE THIS
JuanEnriquez_2007S SO THE LESSON IN AGRICULTURE IS THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE SYSTEM THAT'S BASED ON BRUTE FORCE AS YOU START MERGING THAT SYSTEM AND LEARNING THAT SYSTEM AND ACTUALLY APPLYING BIOLOGY
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND YOU MOVE FROM A DISCIPLINE OF ENGINEERING YOU MOVE FROM A DISCIPLINE OF CHEMISTRY INTO A DISCIPLINE OF BIOLOGY AND PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT HUMAN BEINGS ON THE PLANET IS THIS GUY BEHIND ME
JuanEnriquez_2007S THIS IS A GUY CALLED NORMAN BORLAUG HE WON THE NOBEL PRIZE HE 'S GOT THE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR HE DESERVES ALL OF THIS STUFF
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND HE DESERVES THIS STUFF BECAUSE HE PROBABLY HAS FED MORE PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING ALIVE BECAUSE HE RESEARCHED HOW TO PUT BIOLOGY BEHIND SEEDS
JuanEnriquez_2007S HE DID THIS IN MEXICO THE REASON WHY INDIA AND CHINA NO LONGER HAVE THESE MASSIVE FAMINES IS BECAUSE NORMAN BORLAUG TAUGHT THEM HOW TO GROW GRAINS IN A MORE EFFICIENT WAY AND LAUNCHED THE GREEN REVOLUTION
JuanEnriquez_2007S THAT IS SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE CRITICIZED BUT OF COURSE THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T REALIZE THAT CHINA AND INDIA INSTEAD OF HAVING HUGE AMOUNTS OF STARVING PEOPLE
JuanEnriquez_2007S ARE EXPORTING GRAINS
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND THE IRONY OF THIS PARTICULAR SYSTEM IS THE PLACE WHERE HE DID THE RESEARCH WHICH WAS MEXICO DIDN'T ADOPT THIS TECHNOLOGY IGNORED THIS TECHNOLOGY TALKED ABOUT
JuanEnriquez_2007S WHY THIS TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE THOUGHT ABOUT BUT NOT REALLY APPLIED AND MEXICO REMAINS ONE OF THE LARGEST GRAIN IMPORTERS ON THE PLANET
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND THE INSTITUTE THAT THIS GUY RAN HAS NOW MOVED TO INDIA
JuanEnriquez_2007S THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ADOPTING TECHNOLOGIES AND DISCUSSING TECHNOLOGIES
JuanEnriquez_2007S NOW IT'S NOT JUST THAT THIS GUY FED A HUGE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
JuanEnriquez_2007S THAT THIS IS THE NET EFFECT IN TERMS OF WHAT TECHNOLOGY DOES IF YOU UNDERSTAND BIOLOGY
JuanEnriquez_2007S LOOK DIFFERENT
JuanEnriquez_2007S THE MACHINES WERE TRACTORS OR
JuanEnriquez_2007S STUFF INSTEAD OF MULES BUT THE FARMER WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD THIS IS WHAT THE GUY 'S DOING THIS IS WHY HE 'S DOING IT THIS IS WHERE HE 'S GOING
JuanEnriquez_2007S WHAT REALLY STARTED TO CHANGE IN AGRICULTURE IS WHEN YOU STARTED MOVING FROM THIS BRUTE FORCE ENGINEERING AND CHEMISTRY INTO BIOLOGY AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GET YOUR PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND AS YOU DO THAT STUFF
JuanEnriquez_2007S HERE 'S WHAT HAPPENS TO PRODUCTIVITY BASICALLY YOU GO FROM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOURS TO PRODUCE ONE HUNDRED BUSHELS
JuanEnriquez_2007S TO FORTY TO FIFTEEN TO FIVE
JuanEnriquez_2007S FIFTY TO TWO THOUSAND
JuanEnriquez_2007S THE REST OF THE ECONOMY INCREASED ABOUT TWO POINT
JuanEnriquez_2007S THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE INCREASE IN HOW MUCH IS PRODUCED PER PERSON
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND FIFTY PERCENT OF THE EU BUDGET IS GOING TO SUBSIDIZE AGRICULTURE
JuanEnriquez_2007S MOUNTAINS OF STUFF THAT PEOPLE HAVE OVERPRODUCED
JuanEnriquez_2007S THIS WOULD BE A GOOD OUTCOME FOR ENERGY
JuanEnriquez_2007S I THOUGHT I CAME TO A TALK ABOUT ENERGY
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND HERE 'S THIS GUY TALKING ABOUT BIOLOGY
JuanEnriquez_2007S SO WHERE'S THE LINK BETWEEN THESE TWO THINGS
JuanEnriquez_2007S THE IRONIES OF THIS WHOLE SYSTEM IS WE'RE DISCUSSING WHAT TO DO ABOUT A SYSTEM THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
JuanEnriquez_2007S WE DON'T KNOW WHERE OIL COMES FROM
JuanEnriquez_2007S THE BEST ASSUMPTION AND ONE OF THE BEST GUESSES IN THIS STUFF IS THAT THIS STUFF
JuanEnriquez_2007S THAT THESE THINGS ABSORB SUNLIGHT
JuanEnriquez_2007S UNDER PRESSURE FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND YOU GET THESE BLACK RIVERS
JuanEnriquez_2007S THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THAT THESIS IF THAT THESIS TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE IS THAT OIL
JuanEnriquez_2007S IF YOU THINK OF BIOENERGY BIOENERGY ISN'T ETHANOL BIOENERGY IS TAKING THE SUN CONCENTRATING IT IN AMOEBAS CONCENTRATING IT IN PLANTS
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY YOU GET THESE RAINBOWS
JuanEnriquez_2007S AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS SYSTEM
JuanEnriquez_2007S IF HYDROCARBONS ARE CONCENTRATED SUNLIGHT
JuanEnriquez_2007S THEN BIOENERGY WORKS IN A DIFFERENT WAY
JuanEnriquez_2007S WE'VE GOT TO START THINKING OF OIL
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND OTHER HYDROCARBONS
JuanEnriquez_2007S AS PART OF THESE SOLAR PANELS
JuanEnriquez_2007S MAYBE THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IF YOU FLY OVER WEST TEXAS
JuanEnriquez_2007S THE TYPES OF WELLS THAT YOU'RE BEGINNING TO SEE DON'T LOOK
JuanEnriquez_2007S THOSE IRRIGATED PLOTS
JuanEnriquez_2007S THIS IS HOW YOU FARM OIL
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND AS YOU THINK OF FARMING OIL AND HOW OIL HAS EVOLVED WE STARTED WITH THIS BRUTE FORCE APPROACH
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND THEN WHAT DID WE LEARN THEN WE LEARNED WE HAD TO GO BIGGER
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND THEN WHAT'D WE LEARN THEN WE HAVE TO GO EVEN
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND WE ARE GETTING REALLY DESTRUCTIVE AS WE'RE GOING OUT
JuanEnriquez_2007S THESE ARE THE ATHABASCA TAR SANDS AND THERE'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT FIRST OF MINING THE LARGEST TRUCKS IN THE WORLD ARE WORKING HERE AND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO PULL OUT THIS BLACK SLUDGE WHICH IS BASICALLY OIL THAT DOESN'T FLOW
JuanEnriquez_2007S TIED TO THE SAND AND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO USE A LOT OF STEAM TO SEPARATE IT WHICH ONLY WORKS AT TODAY 'S OIL PRICES
JuanEnriquez_2007S SO YOU TAKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS YOU BURN IT YOU PUT IT UNDER PRESSURE AND LIKELY AS NOT YOU GET THIS ALTHOUGH AGAIN I STRESS WE DON'T KNOW
JuanEnriquez_2007S WHICH IS CURIOUS AS WE DEBATE ALL THIS STUFF
JuanEnriquez_2007S BUT AS YOU THINK OF COAL
JuanEnriquez_2007S THIS IS WHAT BURNED WHEAT KERNELS LOOK LIKE
JuanEnriquez_2007S NOT ENTIRELY UNLIKE COAL
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND OF COURSE COAL MINES
JuanEnriquez_2007S ARE VERY DANGEROUS PLACES
JuanEnriquez_2007S WHEN THAT GAS BLOWS UP PEOPLE DIE
JuanEnriquez_2007S SO YOU'RE PRODUCING A BIOGAS OUT OF COAL IN SOME MINES BUT NOT IN OTHERS
JuanEnriquez_2007S ANY PLACE YOU SEE A DIFFERENTIAL THERE 'RE SOME INTERESTING QUESTIONS
JuanEnriquez_2007S SOME QUESTIONS AS TO WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING WITH THIS STUFF
JuanEnriquez_2007S BUT AGAIN COAL MAYBE THE SAME STUFF MAYBE THE SAME SYSTEM MAYBE BIOENERGY AND YOU'RE APPLYING EXACTLY THE SAME TECHNOLOGY HERE 'S YOUR BRUTE FORCE APPROACH
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND YOU END UP WITH THE SINGLE LARGEST SOURCE OF CARBON EMISSIONS
JuanEnriquez_2007S WHICH ARE COAL FIRED GAS PLANTS
JuanEnriquez_2007S THAT IS PROBABLY NOT THE BEST USE OF
JuanEnriquez_2007S AS YOU THINK OF WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES TO THIS SYSTEM IT'S IMPORTANT TO FIND ALTERNATIVES BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT THE U S IS DWINDLING IN ITS PETROLEUM RESERVES BUT IT IS NOT DWINDLING IN ITS COAL RESERVES
JuanEnriquez_2007S THERE ARE HUGE COAL RESERVES THAT ARE SITTING OUT THERE
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND WE'VE GOT TO START THINKING OF THEM AS BIOLOGICAL ENERGY BECAUSE IF WE KEEP TREATING THEM AS CHEMICAL ENERGY OR ENGINEERING ENERGY WE'RE GONNA BE IN DEEP DOO DOO
JuanEnriquez_2007S A SIMILAR ISSUE
JuanEnriquez_2007S GAS IS ALSO A BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND AS YOU THINK OF GAS
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND HERE 'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF MINING COAL
JuanEnriquez_2007S THIS IS CALLED COAL BED METHANE
JuanEnriquez_2007S WHY IS THIS PICTURE INTERESTING BECAUSE IF COAL TURNS OUT TO BE CONCENTRATED PLANT LIFE
JuanEnriquez_2007S THE REASON WHY YOU MAY GET A DIFFERENTIAL IN GAS OUTPUT BETWEEN ONE MINE AND ANOTHER THE REASON WHY ONE MINE MAY BLOW UP AND ANOTHER ONE MAY NOT
JuanEnriquez_2007S BECAUSE THERE'S STUFF
JuanEnriquez_2007S THAT STUFF AND PRODUCING GAS
JuanEnriquez_2007S IT MAY TURN OUT THAT BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN COAL MINES HAVE THE SAME PROCESS IF THAT IS TRUE THEN ONE OF THE WAYS OF GETTING THE ENERGY OUT OF COAL MAY NOT BE TO
JuanEnriquez_2007S WHOLE MOUNTAINTOPS
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND IT MAY NOT BE TO BURN COAL IT MAY BE TO HAVE STUFF PROCESS THAT COAL IN A BIOLOGICAL FASHION AS YOU DID IN AGRICULTURE
JuanEnriquez_2007S THAT IS WHAT
JuanEnriquez_2007S IT IS NOT ETHANOL IT IS NOT SUBSIDIES TO A FEW COMPANIES IT IS NOT IMPORTING CORN INTO IOWA BECAUSE YOU'VE BUILT SO MANY OF THESE ETHANOL PLANTS
JuanEnriquez_2007S IT IS BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND THE TRANSITION THAT OCCURRED IN AGRICULTURE FROM BRUTE FORCE INTO BIOLOGICAL FORCE AND IN THE MEASURE THAT YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN CLEAN SOME STUFF AND YOU CAN CLEAN IT PRETTY QUICKLY
JuanEnriquez_2007S THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING STAGES OF THIS STUFF AND AS YOU THINK OF BIOMATERIALS THIS GUY WHO DID PART OF THE SEQUENCING OF THE HUMAN GENOME
JuanEnriquez_2007S THE DATABASES OF GENES AND PROTEINS KNOWN ON EARTH BY SAILING AROUND THE WORLD
JuanEnriquez_2007S HAS BEEN THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU STRUCTURE THIS AND THERE'S A SERIES OF SMART PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND WHAT THOSE COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO DO IS TO THINK OF HOW DO YOU APPLY BIOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES TO AVOID BRUTE FORCE
JuanEnriquez_2007S THINK OF IT IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS THINK OF IT AS BEGINNING TO PROGRAM STUFF FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES THINK OF THE CELL AS A HARDWARE THINK OF THE GENES AS A SOFTWARE
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND IN THE MEASURE THAT YOU BEGIN TO THINK OF LIFE AS CODE THAT IS INTERCHANGEABLE THAT CAN BECOME ENERGY THAT CAN BECOME FOOD THAT CAN BECOME FIBER THAT CAN BECOME HUMAN BEINGS THAT CAN BECOME A WHOLE SERIES OF THINGS
JuanEnriquez_2007S THEN YOU'VE GOT TO SHIFT YOUR APPROACH AS TO HOW YOU'RE GOING TO STRUCTURE AND DEAL AND THINK ABOUT ENERGY IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY
JuanEnriquez_2007S WHAT ARE THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF THIS STUFF AND WHERE ARE WE
JuanEnriquez_2007S THIS IS ONE OF THE GENTLE GIANTS ON THE PLANET HE 'S ONE OF THE NICEST HUMAN BEINGS YOU'VE EVER MET
JuanEnriquez_2007S HE WON THE NOBEL FOR FIGURING OUT HOW TO CUT GENES SOMETHING CALLED RESTRICTION ENZYMES
JuanEnriquez_2007S HE WAS AT HOPKINS WHEN HE DID THIS AND HE 'S SUCH A MODEST GUY
JuanEnriquez_2007S THAT THE DAY HE WON HIS MOTHER CALLED
JuanEnriquez_2007S BUT ANYWAY THIS GUY IS JUST A CLASS ACT YOU FIND HIM AT THE BENCH EVERY SINGLE DAY
JuanEnriquez_2007S WHAT IS THIS THIS IS THE FIRST TRANSPLANT OF NAKED DNA WHERE YOU TAKE AN ENTIRE DNA OPERATING SYSTEM OUT OF ONE CELL INSERT IT INTO A DIFFERENT CELL AND HAVE THAT CELL BOOT UP AS A SEPARATE SPECIES
JuanEnriquez_2007S YOU WILL SEE STUFF IN THE NEXT MONTH THAT WILL BE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THIS STUFF
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND AS YOU THINK ABOUT THIS STUFF AND WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS ARE WE'RE GOING TO START NOT JUST
JuanEnriquez_2007S IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE TO PROCESS THIS STUFF BOTH IN ECONOMIC TERMS AND IN ENERGY TERMS
JuanEnriquez_2007S THIS IS WHAT ACCUMULATES IN THE TAR SANDS OF ALBERTA
JuanEnriquez_2007S THESE ARE SULFUR BLOCKS
JuanEnriquez_2007S BECAUSE AS YOU SEPARATE THAT PETROLEUM FROM THE SAND AND USE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY INSIDE THAT VAPOR
JuanEnriquez_2007S STEAM TO SEPARATE THIS STUFF YOU ALSO HAVE TO SEPARATE OUT THE SULFUR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIGHT CRUDE AND HEAVY CRUDE WELL IT'S ABOUT FOURTEEN BUCKS A BARREL
JuanEnriquez_2007S THAT'S WHY YOU'RE BUILDING THESE PYRAMIDS OF SULFUR BLOCKS AND BY THE WAY THE SCALE ON THESE THINGS IS PRETTY LARGE
JuanEnriquez_2007S NOW IF YOU CAN TAKE PART OF THE ENERGY CONTENT OUT OF DOING THIS YOU REDUCE THE SYSTEM
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND YOU REALLY DO START APPLYING BIOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES TO ENERGY THIS HAS TO BE A BRIDGE
JuanEnriquez_2007S TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN GET TO WIND TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN GET TO SOLAR TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN GET TO NUCLEAR
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND HOPEFULLY YOU WON 'T BUILD THE NEXT NUCLEAR PLANT ON A BEAUTIFUL SEASHORE NEXT TO AN EARTHQUAKE FAULT
JuanEnriquez_2007S FOR THE NEXT DECADE AT LEAST
JuanEnriquez_2007S THE NAME OF THE GAME IS HYDROCARBONS
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND BE THAT OIL BE THAT GAS BE THAT COAL
JuanEnriquez_2007S THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND BEFORE I MAKE THIS TALK TOO LONG
JuanEnriquez_2007S HERE 'S WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE CURRENT ENERGY SYSTEM
JuanEnriquez_2007S EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF THE ENERGY WE CONSUME ARE HYDROCARBONS THAT MEANS EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF THE STUFF WE'RE CONSUMING ARE PROBABLY PROCESSED PLANTS
JuanEnriquez_2007S AMOEBAS AND THE REST OF THE STUFF
JuanEnriquez_2007S HOW WE DEAL WITH THAT OTHER PORTION IS OUR BRIDGE TO THE FUTURE
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND AS WE THINK OF THIS BRIDGE TO THE FUTURE ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SHOULD PONDER IS WE ARE LEAVING ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE OIL TODAY INSIDE THOSE WELLS
JuanEnriquez_2007S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND LEAVING MOST OF THE ENERGY DOWN
JuanEnriquez_2007S WHICH OF COURSE REQUIRES MORE ENERGY TO GO OUT AND GET ENERGY THE RATIOS BECOME IDIOTIC BY THE TIME YOU GET TO ETHANOL IT MAY EVEN BE A ONE TO ONE RATIO ON THE ENERGY INPUT AND THE ENERGY
JuanEnriquez_2007S THAT IS A STUPID WAY OF MANAGING THIS SYSTEM
JuanEnriquez_2007S LAST POINT LAST GRAPH
JuanEnriquez_2007S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE GOT TO DO IS TO STABILIZE OIL
JuanEnriquez_2007S THIS IS WHAT OIL PRICES LOOK LIKE
JuanEnriquez_2007S THIS IS A VERY BAD SYSTEM BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS YOUR HURDLE RATE GETS SET VERY LOW PEOPLE COME UP WITH REALLY SMART IDEAS FOR SOLAR PANELS OR FOR WIND OR FOR SOMETHING ELSE
JuanEnriquez_2007S AND THEN GUESS WHAT THE OIL PRICE GOES THROUGH THE FLOOR THAT COMPANY GOES OUT OF BUSINESS AND THEN YOU CAN BRING THE OIL PRICE BACK
JuanEnriquez_2007S SO IF I HAD ONE CLOSING AND MODEST SUGGESTION
JuanEnriquez_2007S STABLE OIL PRICE IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES
JuanEnriquez_2007S HOW DO YOU DO THAT WELL LET 'S PUT A TAX ON OIL THAT IS A NON REVENUE TAX AND IT BASICALLY SAYS FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS THE PRICE OF OIL WILL BE WHATEVER YOU WANT THIRTY FIVE BUCKS FORTY BUCKS
JuanEnriquez_2007S IF THE OPEC PRICE FALLS BELOW THAT WE TAX
JuanEnriquez_2007S IF THE OPEC PRICE GOES ABOVE THAT THE TAX GOES AWAY
JuanEnriquez_2007S NOT PUT PEOPLE THROUGH THIS CYCLE WHERE IT DOESN'T PAY TO RESEARCH BECAUSE YOUR COMPANY WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS AS OPEC DRIVES ALTERNATIVES AND KEEPS BIOENERGY FROM HAPPENING
