KatherineFulton_2007 I WANT TO HELP YOU RE PERCEIVE WHAT PHILANTHROPY IS WHAT IT COULD BE
KatherineFulton_2007 AND WHAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO IT
KatherineFulton_2007 AND IN DOING THAT I WANT TO OFFER YOU A VISION AN IMAGINED FUTURE IF YOU WILL
KatherineFulton_2007 OF HOW AS
KatherineFulton_2007 THE POET SEAMUS HEANEY HAS PUT IT
KatherineFulton_2007 ONCE IN A LIFETIME
KatherineFulton_2007 THE LONGED FOR TIDAL WAVE OF JUSTICE CAN RISE UP
KatherineFulton_2007 AND HOPE AND HISTORY RHYME
KatherineFulton_2007 I WANT TO START WITH
KatherineFulton_2007 WE ALL KNOW WHICH SIDE OF THESE WE'D LIKE TO BE ON
KatherineFulton_2007 THEY DIDN'T THINK OF THEMSEVLES ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THESE EITHER
KatherineFulton_2007 BUT BY THE END OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY A NEW GENERATION OF CRITICS AND REFORMERS
KatherineFulton_2007 HAD COME TO SEE PHILANTHROPY JUST THIS WAY
KatherineFulton_2007 THE THING TO WATCH FOR AS A GLOBAL PHILANTHROPY INDUSTRY COMES ABOUT AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING
KatherineFulton_2007 IS HOW THE ASPIRATION IS TO FLIP THESE OLD ASSUMPTIONS FOR PHILANTHROPY TO BECOME OPEN AND BIG AND FAST AND CONNECTED
KatherineFulton_2007 IN SERVICE OF THE LONG TERM THIS ENTREPRENEURIAL ENERGY IS EMERGING FROM MANY QUARTERS AND IT'S DRIVEN AND PROPELLED FORWARD BY NEW LEADERS LIKE MANY OF THE PEOPLE HERE BY NEW TOOLS LIKE THE ONES WE'VE SEEN HERE BY NEW PRESSURES
KatherineFulton_2007 I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS CHANGE FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW AND PARTICIPATING IN IT THIS REPORT IS OUR MAIN PUBLIC REPORT WHAT IT TELLS IS THE STORY OF HOW TODAY ACTUALLY COULD BE AS HISTORIC AS ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
KatherineFulton_2007 WHAT I WANT TO DO IS SHARE SOME OF THE COOLEST THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON WITH YOU
KatherineFulton_2007 AND AS I DO THAT I'M NOT GOING TO DWELL MUCH ON THE VERY LARGE PHILANTHROPY THAT EVERYBODY ALREADY KNOWS ABOUT
KatherineFulton_2007 THE GATES AND THE SOROS AND THE GOOGLE
KatherineFulton_2007 WHAT I WANT TO DO IS TALK ABOUT THE PHILANTHROPY OF ALL OF US
KatherineFulton_2007 FIRST IS MASS COLLABORATION REPRESENTED HERE BY WIKIPEDIA NOW THIS MAY SURPRISE YOU
KatherineFulton_2007 CLAY SHIRKY THAT GREAT CHRONICLER OF EVERYTHING NETWORKED
KatherineFulton_2007 HE SAID WE HAVE LIVED IN THIS WORLD WHERE LITTLE THINGS ARE DONE FOR LOVE AND BIG THINGS FOR MONEY NOW WE HAVE WIKIPEDIA
KatherineFulton_2007 WATCH THIS SPRING
KatherineFulton_2007 FOR PAUL HAWKEN 'S NEW BOOK AUTHOR AND ENTREPRENEUR MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW ABOUT THE BOOK IS CALLED BLESSED UNREST AND WHEN IT COMES OUT A SERIES OF WIKI SITES UNDER THE LABEL WISER ARE GOING TO LAUNCH AT THE SAME TIME WISER STANDS FOR WORLD INDEX FOR SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
KatherineFulton_2007 WISER SETS OUT TO DOCUMENT LINK AND EMPOWER WHAT PAUL CALLS THE LARGEST MOVEMENT AND FASTEST GROWING MOVEMENT IN HUMAN HISTORY
KatherineFulton_2007 HUMANITY 'S COLLECTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO TODAY 'S THREATS
KatherineFulton_2007 NOW ALL OF THESE BIG THINGS FOR LOVE EXPERIMENTS AREN'T GOING TO TAKE OFF
KatherineFulton_2007 BUT THE ONES THAT DO ARE GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST THE MOST OPEN THE FASTEST THE MOST CONNECTED FORM OF PHILANTHROPY IN HUMAN HISTORY
KatherineFulton_2007 THIS IS OF COURSE TO PHILANTHROPY WHAT EBAY AND AMAZON ARE TO COMMERCE
KatherineFulton_2007 THINK OF IT AS PEER TO PEER PHILANTHROPY
KatherineFulton_2007 AND THIS CHALLENGES YET ANOTHER ASSUMPTION
KatherineFulton_2007 WHICH IS THAT ORGANIZED PHILANTHROPY IS ONLY FOR THE VERY WEALTHY
KatherineFulton_2007 TAKE A LOOK IF YOU HAVEN 'T AT DONORSCHOOSE OMIDYAR NETWORK HAS MADE A BIG INVESTMENT IN DONORSCHOOSE IT'S ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN OF THESE NEW MARKETPLACES WHERE A DONOR CAN GO STRAIGHT
KatherineFulton_2007 INTO A CLASSROOM AND CONNECT WITH WHAT A TEACHER SAYS THEY NEED TAKE A LOOK AT CHANGING THE PRESENT STARTED BY A TEDSTER NEXT TIME YOU NEED A WEDDING PRESENT OR A HOLIDAY PRESENT
KatherineFulton_2007 THE THIRD CATEGORY IS REPRESENTED BY WARREN BUFFET
KatherineFulton_2007 THERE ARE NOW TODAY SO MANY NEW FUNDS THAT ARE AGGREGATING GIVING AND INVESTING BRINGING TOGETHER PEOPLE
KatherineFulton_2007 AROUND A COMMON GOAL TO THINK BIGGER
KatherineFulton_2007 THE BEST KNOWN IS ACUMEN FUND LED BY JACQUELINE NOVOGRATZ A TEDSTER WHO GOT A BIG BOOST HERE AT TED BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHERS
KatherineFulton_2007 NEW PROFIT IN CAMBRIDGE NEW SCHOOL 'S VENTURE FUND IN SILICON VALLEY VENTURE PHILANTHROPY PARTNERS IN WASHINGTON
KatherineFulton_2007 VENTURE CAPITAL PRIVATE EQUITY
KatherineFulton_2007 AND EVENTUALLY MUTUAL FUNDS ARE
KatherineFulton_2007 TO INVESTING BUT WITH A TWIST BECAUSE OFTEN A COMMUNITY FORMS AROUND THESE FUNDS AS IT HAS AT ACUMEN AND OTHER PLACES
KatherineFulton_2007 NOW IMAGINE FOR A SECOND
KatherineFulton_2007 THESE FIRST THREE
KatherineFulton_2007 THE MASH UP IF YOU WILL OF THESE THINGS IN THE FUTURE WHEN THESE THINGS COME TOGETHER IN THE EXPERIMENTS OF THE FUTURE IMAGINE THAT SOMEBODY PUTS
KatherineFulton_2007 HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR AN INSPIRING GOAL THERE WERE TWENTY ONE GIFTS OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE IN THE US LAST YEAR NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION
KatherineFulton_2007 BUT ONLY PUTS IT UP IF IT'S MATCHED BY MILLIONS OF SMALL GIFTS FROM AROUND THE GLOBE
KatherineFulton_2007 THEREBY ENGAGING LOTS OF PEOPLE AND BUILDING VISIBILITY AND ENGAGING PEOPLE IN THE GOAL THAT'S STATED
KatherineFulton_2007 LOOK QUICKLY AT THE FOURTH AND FIFTH CATEGORIES WHICH ARE INNOVATION COMPETITIONS AND SOCIAL INVESTING
KatherineFulton_2007 BETTING A VISIBLE COMPETITION A PRIZE CAN ATTRACT TALENT AND MONEY TO SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT ISSUES AND THEREBY SPEED THE SOLUTION
KatherineFulton_2007 AND THE ORGANIZATION IS AT THE CENTER AS OPPOSED TO PUTTING THE PROBLEM AT THE CENTER
KatherineFulton_2007 ESPECIALLY WITH THINGS THAT REQUIRE TECHNOLOGICAL OR SCIENTIFIC SOLUTION
KatherineFulton_2007 THAT LEAVES THE FINAL CATEGORY SOCIAL INVESTING WHICH IS REALLY ANYWAY THE BIGGEST OF THEM ALL REPRESENTED HERE BY XIGI NET
KatherineFulton_2007 THIS OF COURSE TACKLES THE BIGGEST ASSUMPTION OF ALL
KatherineFulton_2007 THAT BUSINESS IS BUSINESS AND PHILANTHROPY IS THE VEHICLE OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO CREATE CHANGE IN THE WORLD
KatherineFulton_2007 IS A NEW COMMUNITY SITE THAT'S BUILT BY THE COMMUNITY LINKING AND MAPPING THIS NEW SOCIAL CAPITAL MARKET
KatherineFulton_2007 TO HELP US
KatherineFulton_2007 THAT IF WE CAN LEVERAGE EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE CAPITAL THAT IT SEEKS TO RETURN
KatherineFulton_2007 THE GOOD THAT CAN BE DRIVEN
KatherineFulton_2007 NOW WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING HERE
KatherineFulton_2007 IS THAT WE'RE NOT
KatherineFulton_2007 WE'RE ACTING OUR WAY INTO A NEW WAY OF THINKING
KatherineFulton_2007 AND EVEN THOUGH ALL OF THE EXPERIMENTS AND ALL OF THE BIG GIVERS DON'T YET FULFILL THIS ASPIRATION I THINK THIS IS THE
KatherineFulton_2007 OPEN BIG
KatherineFulton_2007 LONG WE HAVE GOT TO REALIZE THAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME TO DO THESE THINGS
KatherineFulton_2007 STICK WITH IT ALL OF THIS STUFF IS JUST GOING TO BE
KatherineFulton_2007 AND I'M HOPEFUL BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY PHILANTHROPY THAT'S REORGANIZING ITSELF
KatherineFulton_2007 IT'S ALSO WHOLE OTHER PORTIONS OF THE SOCIAL SECTOR
KatherineFulton_2007 AND OF BUSINESS
KatherineFulton_2007 AND EVERYWHERE I GO INCULDING HERE AT TED
KatherineFulton_2007 WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS PEOPLE REALLY WRESTLING TO DESCRIBE WHAT IS THIS NEW THING THAT'S HAPPENING WORDS LIKE PHILANTHROCAPITALISM AND NATURAL CAPITALISM AND PHILANTHROENTREPRENEUR AND VENTURE PHILANTHROPY WE DON'T HAVE A LANGUAGE FOR IT YET
KatherineFulton_2007 WHATEVER WE CALL IT
KatherineFulton_2007 IT'S NEW IT'S BEGINNING
KatherineFulton_2007 AND I THINK IT'S GONG TO QUITE SIGNIFICANT
KatherineFulton_2007 GOING TO CALL THE SOCIAL SINGULARITY MANY OF YOU WILL REALIZE THAT I'M RIPPING A BIT OFF OF THE SCIENCE FICTION WRITER VERNOR VINGE 'S NOTION OF A TECHNOLOGICAL SINGULARITY WHERE A NUMBER OF TRENDS ACCELERATE AND CONVERGE AND COME TOGETHER TO CREATE REALLY A SHOCKINGLY NEW REALITY IT MAY BE
KatherineFulton_2007 THAT THE SOCIAL SINGULARITY AHEAD
KatherineFulton_2007 IS THE ONE THAT WE FEAR THE MOST
KatherineFulton_2007 A CONVERGENCE OF CATASTROPHES OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION
KatherineFulton_2007 OUR ABILITY TO CONFRONT THE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE HAS NOT KEPT PACE WITH OUR ABILITY TO CREATE THEM
KatherineFulton_2007 WE HOLD THE FUTURE OF OUR CIVILIZATION IN OUR HANDS AS NEVER BEFORE
KatherineFulton_2007 THE QUESTION IS IS THERE A POSITIVE SOCIAL SINGULARITY IS THERE A FRONTIER
KatherineFulton_2007 FUTURE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE IMAGINED WE CAN CREATE A FUTURE WHERE HOPE AND HISTORY RHYME
KatherineFulton_2007 OUR EXPERIENCE TO DATE
KatherineFulton_2007 A NEW GENERATION OF CITIZEN LEADERS
KatherineFulton_2007 WILLING TO COMMIT OURSELVES TO GROWING AND CHANGING AND LEARNING AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE
KatherineFulton_2007 I KEEP THIS PHOTOGRAPH CLOSE BY TO ME
KatherineFulton_2007 IN MY OFFICE BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS FELT A MYSTICAL CONNECTION TO THESE TWO MEN BOTH
KatherineFulton_2007 THIS BLANK SLIDE
KatherineFulton_2007 THIS A PHOTOGRAPH OF YOU
KatherineFulton_2007 I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU WANT TO BE PART OF CREATING WHATEVER THAT MEANS TO YOU
