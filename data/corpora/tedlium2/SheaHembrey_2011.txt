SheaHembrey_2011@22.41:36.38 I GREW UP IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE ON A DIRT ROAD IN RURAL ARKANSAS AN HOUR FROM THE NEAREST MOVIE THEATER AND I THINK IT WAS A GREAT PLACE TO GROW UP AS AN ARTIST BECAUSE I GREW UP AROUND QUIRKY COLORFUL CHARACTERS WHO WERE GREAT AT MAKING WITH THEIR HANDS
SheaHembrey_2011@51.54:64.71 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT THOUGH WE WERE BIG READERS IN OUR HOUSE AND IF THE TV WAS ON WE WERE WATCHING A DOCUMENTARY AND MY DAD IS THE MOST VORACIOUS READER I KNOW HE CAN READ A NOVEL OR TWO A DAY BUT
SheaHembrey_2011@64.71:73.88 WHEN I WAS LITTLE I REMEMBER HE WOULD KILL FLIES IN OUR HOUSE WITH MY BB GUN AND WHAT WAS SO AMAZING TO ME ABOUT THAT WELL HE WOULD BE IN HIS RECLINER WOULD HOLLER FOR ME
SheaHembrey_2011@94.75:98.9 DAMAGE WHAT IT LANDED ON SO
SheaHembrey_2011@99.29:101.24 I SHOULD TALK ABOUT ART
SheaHembrey_2011@124.99:128.75 I WAS STRUCK BY GOING TO SO MANY ONE AFTER THE OTHER
SheaHembrey_2011@144.46:151.47 AND THE SECOND THING THAT I WAS LONGING FOR WAS SOME MORE EXQUISITE CRAFTSMANSHIP AND TECHNIQUE SO
SheaHembrey_2011@151.95:165.83 I STARTED THINKING AND LISTING WHAT ALL IT WAS THAT I THOUGHT WOULD MAKE A PERFECT BIENNIAL SO I DECIDED I 'M GOING TO START MY OWN BIENNIAL I 'M GOING TO ORGANIZE IT AND DIRECT IT AND GET IT GOING IN THE WORLD
SheaHembrey_2011@165.96:171.45 SO I THOUGHT OKAY I HAVE TO HAVE SOME CRITERIA OF HOW TO CHOOSE WORK
SheaHembrey_2011@192.96:210.24 WORKED ON UNTIL IT CAN SPEAK FLUENTLY AND THEN MY OTHER SECOND SET OF RULES I HATE TO SAY RULES BECAUSE IT 'S ART MY CRITERIA WOULD BE THE THREE H 'S WHICH IS HEAD HEART AND HANDS AND GREAT ART WOULD HAVE HEAD IT WOULD HAVE
SheaHembrey_2011@210.24:221.16 INTERESTING INTELLECTUAL IDEAS AND CONCEPTS IT WOULD HAVE HEART IN THAT IT WOULD HAVE PASSION AND HEART AND SOUL AND IT WOULD HAVE HAND IN THAT IT WOULD BE GREATLY CRAFTED
SheaHembrey_2011@221.16:232.72 SO I STARTED THINKING ABOUT HOW AM I GOING TO DO THIS BIENNIAL HOW AM I GOING TO TRAVEL THE WORLD AND FIND THESE ARTISTS AND THEN I REALIZED ONE DAY THERE 'S AN EASIER SOLUTION TO THIS
SheaHembrey_2011@232.78:235.64 I 'M JUST GOING TO MAKE THE WHOLE THING MYSELF
SheaHembrey_2011@241.11:258.3 ARTISTS I 'M GOING TO DO AN INTERNATIONAL BIENNIAL I NEED ARTISTS FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD SO WHAT I DID WAS I INVENTED A HUNDRED ARTISTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD I FIGURED OUT THEIR BIOS THEIR PASSIONS IN LIFE AND THEIR ART STYLES AND I STARTED MAKING THEIR WORK
SheaHembrey_2011@275.33:284.93 I SHOULD START TO TALK ABOUT THESE GUYS WELL THE RANGE IS QUITE A BIT AND I 'M SUCH A TECHNICIAN SO I LOVED THIS PROJECT GETTING TO PLAY WITH ALL THE TECHNIQUES
SheaHembrey_2011@284.93:294.61 SO FOR EXAMPLE IN REALIST PAINTINGS IT RANGES FROM THIS WHICH IS KIND OF OLD MASTERS STYLE TO REALLY REALISTIC STILL LIFE
SheaHembrey_2011@294.61:305.86 TO THIS TYPE OF PAINTING WHERE I 'M PAINTING WITH A SINGLE HAIR AND THEN AT THE OTHER END THERE 'S PERFORMANCE AND SHORT FILMS AND INDOOR INSTALLATIONS LIKE THIS INDOOR INSTALLATION AND THIS ONE
