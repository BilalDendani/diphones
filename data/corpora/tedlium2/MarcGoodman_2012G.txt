MarcGoodman_2012G@17.82:25.34 THE FUTURE OF CRIME AND TERRORISM AND FRANKLY I 'M AFRAID
MarcGoodman_2012G@40.09:57.66 AND THAT 'S INFORMED MY PERSPECTIVE ON THINGS I 'VE BEEN A STREET POLICE OFFICER AN UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATOR A COUNTER TERRORISM STRATEGIST AND I 'VE WORKED IN MORE THAN SEVENTY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD I 'VE HAD TO SEE MORE THAN MY FAIR SHARE OF VIOLENCE AND THE DARKER UNDERBELLY OF SOCIETY
MarcGoodman_2012G@57.66:60.6 AND THAT 'S INFORMED MY OPINIONS
MarcGoodman_2012G@60.6:71.16 MY WORK WITH CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN HIGHLY EDUCATIONAL THEY HAVE TAUGHT ME A LOT AND I 'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SHARE SOME OF THESE OBSERVATIONS WITH YOU
MarcGoodman_2012G@71.16:87.32 TODAY I 'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE FLIP SIDE OF ALL THOSE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE MARVEL AT THE ONES THAT WE LOVE IN THE HANDS OF THE TED COMMUNITY THESE ARE AWESOME TOOLS WHICH WILL BRING ABOUT GREAT CHANGE FOR OUR WORLD
MarcGoodman_2012G@87.32:93.7 BUT IN THE HANDS OF SUICIDE BOMBERS THE FUTURE CAN LOOK QUITE DIFFERENT
MarcGoodman_2012G@93.7:113.52 I STARTED OBSERVING TECHNOLOGY AND HOW CRIMINALS WERE USING IT AS A YOUNG PATROL OFFICER IN THOSE DAYS THIS WAS THE HEIGHT OF TECHNOLOGY LAUGH THOUGH YOU WILL ALL THE DRUG DEALERS AND GANG MEMBERS WITH WHOM I DEALT HAD ONE OF THESE LONG BEFORE ANY POLICE OFFICER I KNEW DID
MarcGoodman_2012G@113.52:118.52 TWENTY YEARS LATER CRIMINALS ARE STILL USING MOBILE PHONES
MarcGoodman_2012G@118.52:134.22 BUT THEY 'RE ALSO BUILDING THEIR OWN MOBILE PHONE NETWORKS LIKE THIS ONE WHICH HAS BEEN DEPLOYED IN ALL THIRTY ONE STATES OF MEXICO BY THE NARCOS THEY HAVE A NATIONAL ENCRYPTED RADIO COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM
MarcGoodman_2012G@134.22:147.96 THINK ABOUT THAT THINK ABOUT THE INNOVATION THAT WENT INTO THAT THINK ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BUILD IT AND THEN THINK ABOUT THIS WHY CAN 'T I GET A CELL PHONE SIGNAL IN SAN FRANCISCO
MarcGoodman_2012G@153.23:163.29 WE CONSISTENTLY UNDERESTIMATE WHAT CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS CAN DO TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE OUR WORLD INCREASINGLY OPEN AND FOR THE MOST PART THAT 'S GREAT
MarcGoodman_2012G@178.08:186.9 THEY THREW THESE HAND GRENADES AT INNOCENT PEOPLE AS THEY SAT EATING IN CAFES AND WAITED TO CATCH TRAINS ON THEIR WAY HOME FROM WORK
MarcGoodman_2012G@186.9:204.31 BUT HEAVY ARTILLERY IS NOTHING NEW IN TERRORIST OPERATIONS GUNS AND BOMBS ARE NOTHING NEW WHAT WAS DIFFERENT THIS TIME IS THE WAY THAT THE TERRORISTS USED MODERN INFORMATION COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES TO LOCATE ADDITIONAL VICTIMS AND SLAUGHTER THEM
MarcGoodman_2012G@204.39:215.47 THEY WERE ARMED WITH MOBILE PHONES THEY HAD BLACKBERRIES THEY HAD ACCESS TO SATELLITE IMAGERY THEY HAD SATELLITE PHONES AND THEY EVEN HAD NIGHT VISION GOGGLES
MarcGoodman_2012G@215.88:219.75 BUT PERHAPS THEIR GREATEST INNOVATION WAS THIS
MarcGoodman_2012G@219.75:230.2 WE 'VE ALL SEEN PICTURES LIKE THIS ON TELEVISION AND IN THE NEWS THIS IS AN OPERATIONS CENTER AND THE TERRORISTS BUILT THEIR VERY OWN OP CENTER ACROSS THE BORDER IN PAKISTAN
MarcGoodman_2012G@230.2:240.93 WHERE THEY MONITORED THE BBC AL JAZEERA CNN AND INDIAN LOCAL STATIONS THEY ALSO MONITORED THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA
MarcGoodman_2012G@240.93:245.44 TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THEIR ATTACKS AND HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY HAD KILLED
MarcGoodman_2012G@245.74:260.92 THEY DID ALL OF THIS IN REAL TIME THE INNOVATION OF THE TERRORIST OPERATIONS CENTER GAVE TERRORISTS UNPARALLELED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND TACTICAL ADVANTAGE OVER THE POLICE AND OVER THE GOVERNMENT
MarcGoodman_2012G@260.92:270.56 WHAT DID THEY DO WITH THIS THEY USED IT TO GREAT EFFECT AT ONE POINT DURING THE SIXTY HOUR SIEGE THE TERRORISTS WERE GOING ROOM TO ROOM TRYING TO FIND ADDITIONAL VICTIMS
MarcGoodman_2012G@270.56:283.35 THEY CAME UPON A SUITE ON THE TOP FLOOR OF THE HOTEL AND THEY KICKED DOWN THE DOOR AND THEY FOUND A MAN HIDING BY HIS BED AND THEY SAID TO HIM WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AND THE MAN REPLIED
MarcGoodman_2012G@283.52:285.68 I 'M JUST AN INNOCENT SCHOOLTEACHER
MarcGoodman_2012G@285.76:288.16 OF COURSE THE TERRORISTS KNEW
MarcGoodman_2012G@288.28:297.96 THAT NO INDIAN SCHOOLTEACHER STAYS AT A SUITE IN THE TAJ THEY PICKED UP HIS IDENTIFICATION AND THEY PHONED HIS NAME IN TO THE TERRORIST WAR ROOM
MarcGoodman_2012G@298.33:308.11 WHERE THE TERRORIST WAR ROOM GOOGLED HIM AND FOUND A PICTURE AND CALLED THEIR OPERATIVES ON THE GROUND AND SAID YOUR HOSTAGE IS HE HEAVYSET
MarcGoodman_2012G@308.11:310.8 IS HE BALD IN FRONT
MarcGoodman_2012G@310.8:314.73 DOES HE WEAR GLASSES YES
MarcGoodman_2012G@314.73:332.32 YES YES CAME THE ANSWERS THE OP CENTER HAD FOUND HIM AND THEY HAD A MATCH HE WAS NOT A SCHOOLTEACHER HE WAS THE SECOND WEALTHIEST BUSINESSMAN IN INDIA AND AFTER DISCOVERING THIS INFORMATION THE TERRORIST WAR ROOM GAVE THE ORDER TO THE TERRORISTS ON THE GROUND IN MUMBAI
MarcGoodman_2012G@335.75:340.5 WE ALL WORRY ABOUT OUR PRIVACY SETTINGS ON FACEBOOK
MarcGoodman_2012G@341.39:353.63 BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS OUR OPENNESS CAN BE USED AGAINST US TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS A SEARCH ENGINE CAN DETERMINE WHO SHALL LIVE
MarcGoodman_2012G@358.7:373.4 DURING THE MUMBAI SIEGE TERRORISTS WERE SO DEPENDENT ON TECHNOLOGY THAT SEVERAL WITNESSES REPORTED THAT AS THE TERRORISTS WERE SHOOTING HOSTAGES WITH ONE HAND THEY WERE CHECKING THEIR MOBILE PHONE MESSAGES IN THE VERY OTHER HAND
MarcGoodman_2012G@373.4:383.64 IN THE END THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE GRAVELY WOUNDED AND OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN LOST THEIR LIVES THAT DAY
MarcGoodman_2012G@383.64:399.07 THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED DURING THIS SIXTY HOUR SIEGE ON MUMBAI TEN MEN ARMED NOT JUST WITH WEAPONS BUT WITH TECHNOLOGY WERE ABLE TO BRING A CITY OF TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE
MarcGoodman_2012G@399.2:406.52 TO A STANDSTILL TEN PEOPLE BROUGHT TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE TO A STANDSTILL AND THIS TRAVELED AROUND THE WORLD
MarcGoodman_2012G@406.63:410.66 THIS IS WHAT RADICALS CAN DO
MarcGoodman_2012G@410.7:414.16 WITH OPENNESS
MarcGoodman_2012G@414.16:416.29 THIS WAS DONE NEARLY FOUR YEARS AGO
MarcGoodman_2012G@416.57:423.49 WHAT COULD TERRORISTS DO TODAY WITH THE TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE THAT WE HAVE WHAT WILL THEY DO TOMORROW
MarcGoodman_2012G@423.49:433.4 THE ABILITY OF ONE TO AFFECT MANY IS SCALING EXPONENTIALLY AND IT 'S SCALING FOR GOOD AND IT 'S SCALING FOR EVIL
MarcGoodman_2012G@433.4:439.65 IT 'S NOT JUST ABOUT TERRORISM THOUGH THERE 'S ALSO BEEN A BIG PARADIGM SHIFT IN CRIME YOU SEE
MarcGoodman_2012G@439.65:450.47 YOU CAN NOW COMMIT MORE CRIME AS WELL IN THE OLD DAYS IT WAS A KNIFE AND A GUN THEN CRIMINALS MOVED TO ROBBING TRAINS YOU COULD ROB TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE ON A TRAIN A GREAT INNOVATION
MarcGoodman_2012G@450.47:463.06 MOVING FORWARD THE INTERNET ALLOWED THINGS TO SCALE EVEN MORE IN FACT MANY OF YOU WILL REMEMBER THE RECENT SONY PLAYSTATION HACK IN THAT INCIDENT OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE WERE ROBBED
MarcGoodman_2012G@463.94:472.55 THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS IT EVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB ONE HUNDRED
MarcGoodman_2012G@472.55:474.79 MILLION
MarcGoodman_2012G@474.79:480.71 OF COURSE IT 'S NOT JUST ABOUT STEALING THINGS THERE ARE OTHER AVENUES OF TECHNOLOGY THAT CRIMINALS CAN EXPLOIT
MarcGoodman_2012G@480.9:484.75 MANY OF YOU WILL REMEMBER THIS SUPER CUTE VIDEO FROM THE LAST
MarcGoodman_2012G@490.67:502.49 AND CUTE THEY DON 'T ALL HAVE DRUMSTICKS SOME CAN BE ARMED WITH HD CAMERAS AND DO COUNTERSURVEILLANCE ON PROTESTERS OR AS IN THIS LITTLE BIT OF MOVIE MAGIC QUADCOPTERS CAN BE
MarcGoodman_2012G@502.49:508.58 LOADED WITH FIREARMS AND AUTOMATIC WEAPONS LITTLE ROBOTS
MarcGoodman_2012G@538.44:541.78 EVERY TIME A NEW TECHNOLOGY
MarcGoodman_2012G@541.78:558.72 BEING INTRODUCED CRIMINALS ARE THERE TO EXPLOIT IT WE 'VE ALL SEEN THREE D PRINTERS WE KNOW WITH THEM THAT YOU CAN PRINT IN MANY MATERIALS RANGING FROM PLASTIC TO CHOCOLATE TO METAL AND EVEN CONCRETE WITH GREAT PRECISION I ACTUALLY WAS ABLE TO MAKE THIS
MarcGoodman_2012G@558.72:565 JUST THE OTHER DAY A VERY CUTE LITTLE DUCKY
MarcGoodman_2012G@565:570.73 BUT I WONDER TO MYSELF FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT STRAP
MarcGoodman_2012G@571.02:576.57 BOMBS TO THEIR CHESTS AND BLOW THEMSELVES UP HOW MIGHT THEY USE
MarcGoodman_2012G@576.57:580.41 THREE D PRINTERS PERHAPS
MarcGoodman_2012G@600.33:603.95 THE UK I KNOW HAS SOME VERY STRICT FIREARMS LAWS
MarcGoodman_2012G@604.47:623.5 YOU NEEDN 'T BRING THE GUN INTO THE UK ANYMORE YOU JUST BRING THE THREE D PRINTER AND PRINT THE GUN WHILE YOU 'RE HERE AND OF COURSE THE MAGAZINES FOR YOUR BULLETS BUT AS THESE GET BIGGER IN THE FUTURE WHAT OTHER ITEMS WILL YOU BE ABLE TO PRINT THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALLOWING BIGGER PRINTERS AS WE MOVE FORWARD
MarcGoodman_2012G@630.94:633.96 THAT THE INTERNET OF THINGS WILL SOON BE
MarcGoodman_2012G@634.7:650.43 THE INTERNET OF THINGS TO BE HACKED ALL OF THE PHYSICAL OBJECTS IN OUR SPACE ARE BEING TRANSFORMED INTO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND THAT HAS A RADICAL IMPLICATION FOR OUR SECURITY BECAUSE MORE CONNECTIONS TO MORE DEVICES MEANS MORE VULNERABILITIES
MarcGoodman_2012G@650.43:657.74 CRIMINALS UNDERSTAND THIS TERRORISTS UNDERSTAND THIS HACKERS UNDERSTAND THIS IF YOU CONTROL THE CODE YOU CONTROL THE WORLD
MarcGoodman_2012G@658.03:667.72 THIS IS THE FUTURE THAT AWAITS US THERE HAS NOT YET BEEN AN OPERATING SYSTEM OR A TECHNOLOGY THAT HASN 'T BEEN HACKED
MarcGoodman_2012G@667.72:673.63 THAT 'S TROUBLING SINCE THE HUMAN BODY ITSELF IS NOW BECOMING AN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
MarcGoodman_2012G@673.63:690.21 AS WE 'VE SEEN HERE WE 'RE TRANSFORMING OURSELVES INTO CYBORGS EVERY YEAR THOUSANDS OF COCHLEAR IMPLANTS DIABETIC PUMPS PACEMAKERS AND DEFIBRILLATORS ARE BEING IMPLANTED IN PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES THERE ARE SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO HAVE A PACEMAKER THAT CONNECTS TO THE INTERNET
MarcGoodman_2012G@690.21:701.8 THE DEFIBRILLATORS ALLOW A PHYSICIAN AT A DISTANCE TO GIVE A SHOCK TO A HEART IN CASE A PATIENT NEEDS IT BUT IF YOU DON 'T NEED IT AND SOMEBODY ELSE GIVES YOU THE SHOCK
MarcGoodman_2012G@720.85:739.43 OPERATING SYSTEM DNA AND TO HACKERS DNA IS JUST ANOTHER OPERATING SYSTEM WAITING TO BE HACKED IT 'S A GREAT CHALLENGE FOR THEM THERE ARE PEOPLE ALREADY WORKING ON HACKING THE SOFTWARE OF LIFE AND WHILE MOST OF THEM ARE DOING THIS TO GREAT GOOD AND TO HELP US ALL
MarcGoodman_2012G@739.46:747.38 SOME WON 'T BE SO HOW WILL CRIMINALS ABUSE THIS WELL WITH SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY YOU CAN DO SOME PRETTY NEAT THINGS
MarcGoodman_2012G@747.38:759.77 FOR EXAMPLE I PREDICT THAT WE WILL MOVE AWAY FROM A PLANT BASED NARCOTICS WORLD TO A SYNTHETIC ONE WHY DO YOU NEED THE PLANTS ANYMORE YOU CAN JUST TAKE THE DNA CODE FROM MARIJUANA
MarcGoodman_2012G@759.98:776.77 OR POPPIES OR COCA LEAVES AND CUT AND PAST THAT GENE AND PUT IT INTO YEAST AND YOU CAN TAKE THOSE YEAST AND MAKE THEM MAKE THE COCAINE FOR YOU OR THE MARIJUANA OR ANY OTHER DRUG
MarcGoodman_2012G@776.97:787.64 SO HOW WE USE YEAST IN THE FUTURE IS GOING TO BE REALLY INTERESTING IN FACT WE MAY HAVE SOME REALLY INTERESTING BREAD AND BEER AS WE GO INTO THIS NEXT CENTURY
MarcGoodman_2012G@787.79:798.46 THE COST OF SEQUENCING THE HUMAN GENOME IS DROPPING PRECIPITOUSLY IT WAS PROCEEDING AT MOORE 'S LAW PACE BUT THEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT SOMETHING CHANGED THE TECHNOLOGIES GOT BETTER AND NOW
MarcGoodman_2012G@798.69:803.41 DNA SEQUENCING IS PROCEEDING AT A PACE FIVE TIMES THAT OF MOORE 'S LAW
MarcGoodman_2012G@804.29:808.8 THAT HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR US
MarcGoodman_2012G@808.8:815.51 IT TOOK US THIRTY YEARS TO GET FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER TO THE LEVEL OF CYBERCRIME WE HAVE TODAY
MarcGoodman_2012G@815.51:825.27 BUT LOOKING AT HOW BIOLOGY IS PROCEEDING SO RAPIDLY AND KNOWING CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS AS I DO WE MAY GET THERE A LOT FASTER WITH BIOCRIME IN THE FUTURE
MarcGoodman_2012G@825.27:841.85 IT WILL BE EASY FOR ANYBODY TO GO AHEAD AND PRINT THEIR OWN BIO VIRUS ENHANCED VERSIONS OF EBOLA OR ANTHRAX WEAPONIZED FLU WE RECENTLY SAW A CASE WHERE SOME RESEARCHERS MADE THE H FIVE N ONE AVIAN INFLUENZA VIRUS MORE POTENT
MarcGoodman_2012G@841.85:861.3 IT ALREADY HAS A SEVENTY PERCENT MORTALITY RATE IF YOU GET IT BUT IT 'S HARD TO GET ENGINEERS BY MOVING AROUND A SMALL NUMBER OF GENETIC CHANGES WERE ABLE TO WEAPONIZE IT AND MAKE IT MUCH MORE EASY FOR HUMAN BEINGS TO CATCH SO THAT NOT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WOULD DIE BUT TENS OF MILLIONS YOU SEE YOU CAN
MarcGoodman_2012G@861.3:870.37 GO AHEAD AND CREATE NEW PANDEMICS AND THE RESEARCHERS WHO DID THIS WERE SO PROUD OF THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS THEY WANTED TO PUBLISH IT OPENLY SO THAT EVERYBODY COULD SEE THIS
MarcGoodman_2012G@870.37:873.93 AND GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION
MarcGoodman_2012G@873.93:875.74 BUT IT GOES DEEPER THAN THAT
MarcGoodman_2012G@875.77:886.8 DNA RESEARCHER ANDREW HESSEL HAS POINTED OUT QUITE RIGHTLY THAT IF YOU CAN USE CANCER TREATMENTS MODERN CANCER TREATMENTS TO GO AFTER ONE CELL WHILE LEAVING ALL THE OTHER CELLS AROUND IT INTACT
MarcGoodman_2012G@886.8:896.26 THEN YOU CAN ALSO GO AFTER ANY ONE PERSON 'S CELL PERSONALIZED CANCER TREATMENTS ARE THE FLIP SIDE OF PERSONALIZED BIOWEAPONS
MarcGoodman_2012G@902.15:908.45 HOW WILL WE PROTECT THEM IN THE FUTURE WHAT TO DO
MarcGoodman_2012G@909.24:916.95 WHAT TO DO ABOUT ALL THIS THAT 'S WHAT I GET ASKED ALL THE TIME FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER I WILL BE TWEETING OUT THE ANSWER LATER ON TODAY
MarcGoodman_2012G@919.46:932.37 ACTUALLY IT 'S A BIT MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT AND THERE ARE NO MAGIC BULLETS I DON 'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BUT I KNOW A FEW THINGS IN THE WAKE OF NINE ELEVEN THE BEST SECURITY MINDS
MarcGoodman_2012G@933.06:936.55 PUT TOGETHER ALL THEIR INNOVATION AND THIS IS WHAT THEY CREATED
MarcGoodman_2012G@936.78:945.79 FOR SECURITY IF YOU 'RE EXPECTING THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT THIS TO PROTECT YOU FROM THE COMING ROBOPOCALYPSE
MarcGoodman_2012G@963.1:972.62 DOESN 'T SCALE GLOBALLY AT LEAST IT HASN 'T AND OUR CURRENT SYSTEM OF GUNS BORDER GUARDS BIG GATES AND FENCES ARE OUTDATED IN THE NEW WORLD INTO WHICH WE 'RE MOVING
MarcGoodman_2012G@972.62:992.28 SO HOW MIGHT WE PREPARE FOR SOME OF THESE SPECIFIC THREATS LIKE ATTACKING A PRESIDENT OR A PRIME MINISTER THIS WOULD BE THE NATURAL GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO HIDE AWAY ALL OUR GOVERNMENT LEADERS IN HERMETICALLY SEALED BUBBLES BUT THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK THE COST OF DOING A DNA SEQUENCE IS GOING TO BE TRIVIAL ANYBODY WILL HAVE IT AND WE WILL ALL HAVE THEM IN THE FUTURE
MarcGoodman_2012G@992.28:1009.65 SO MAYBE THERE 'S A MORE RADICAL WAY THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THIS WHAT HAPPENS IF WE WERE TO TAKE THE PRESIDENT 'S DNA OR A KING OR QUEEN 'S AND PUT IT OUT TO A GROUP OF A FEW HUNDRED TRUSTED RESEARCHERS SO THEY COULD STUDY THAT DNA AND DO PENETRATION TESTING AGAINST IT AS A MEANS OF HELPING OUR LEADERS
MarcGoodman_2012G@1009.65:1017.54 OR WHAT IF WE SENT IT OUT TO A FEW THOUSAND OR CONTROVERSIALLY AND NOT WITHOUT ITS RISKS WHAT HAPPENS IF WE JUST GAVE IT TO THE WHOLE PUBLIC
MarcGoodman_2012G@1017.58:1030.33 THEN WE COULD ALL BE ENGAGED IN HELPING WE 'VE ALREADY SEEN EXAMPLES OF THIS WORKING WELL THE ORGANIZED CRIME AND CORRUPTION REPORTING PROJECT IS STAFFED BY JOURNALISTS AND CITIZENS WHERE THEY ARE CROWD SOURCING
MarcGoodman_2012G@1030.65:1045.49 WHAT DICTATORS AND TERRORISTS ARE DOING WITH PUBLIC FUNDS AROUND THE WORLD AND IN A MORE DRAMATIC CASE WE 'VE SEEN IN MEXICO A COUNTRY THAT HAS BEEN RACKED BY FIFTY THOUSAND NARCOTICS RELATED MURDERS IN THE PAST SIX YEARS
MarcGoodman_2012G@1068.64:1084.26 WHETHER OR NOT YOU REALIZE IT WE ARE AT THE DAWN OF A TECHNOLOGICAL ARMS RACE AN ARMS RACE BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO ARE USING TECHNOLOGY FOR GOOD AND THOSE WHO ARE USING IT FOR ILL THE THREAT IS SERIOUS AND THE TIME TO PREPARE FOR IT IS NOW
MarcGoodman_2012G@1084.47:1095.91 I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE TERRORISTS AND CRIMINALS ARE MY PERSONAL BELIEF IS THAT RATHER THAN HAVING A SMALL ELITE FORCE OF HIGHLY TRAINED GOVERNMENT AGENTS HERE TO PROTECT US ALL
MarcGoodman_2012G@1096.28:1115.56 WE 'RE MUCH BETTER OFF HAVING AVERAGE AND ORDINARY CITIZENS APPROACHING THIS PROBLEM AS A GROUP AND SEEING WHAT WE CAN DO IF WE ALL DO OUR PART I THINK WE 'LL BE IN A MUCH BETTER SPACE THE TOOLS TO CHANGE THE WORLD ARE IN EVERYBODY 'S HANDS HOW WE USE THEM IS NOT JUST UP TO ME IT 'S UP TO ALL OF US
MarcGoodman_2012G@1115.56:1123.5 THIS WAS A TECHNOLOGY I WOULD FREQUENTLY DEPLOY AS A POLICE OFFICER THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS BECOME OUTDATED IN OUR CURRENT WORLD
MarcGoodman_2012G@1123.91:1140.72 IT DOESN 'T SCALE IT DOESN 'T WORK GLOBALLY AND IT SURELY DOESN 'T WORK VIRTUALLY WE 'VE SEEN PARADIGM SHIFTS IN CRIME AND TERRORISM THEY CALL FOR A SHIFT TO A MORE OPEN FORM AND A MORE PARTICIPATORY FORM OF LAW ENFORCEMENT
MarcGoodman_2012G@1140.72:1149.84 SO I INVITE YOU TO JOIN ME AFTER ALL PUBLIC SAFETY IS TOO IMPORTANT TO LEAVE TO THE PROFESSIONALS THANK YOU
