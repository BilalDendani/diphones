CharmianGooch_2013G UNTIL HIS DEATH IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX HE WAS THE ALL POWERFUL LEADER OF TURKMENISTAN A CENTRAL ASIAN COUNTRY RICH IN NATURAL GAS NOW HE REALLY LOVED TO ISSUE PRESIDENTIAL DECREES AND ONE RENAMED THE MONTHS OF THE YEAR INCLUDING AFTER HIMSELF AND HIS MOTHER
CharmianGooch_2013G HE SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS CREATING A BIZARRE PERSONALITY CULT AND HIS CROWNING GLORY WAS THE BUILDING OF A FORTY FOOT HIGH GOLD PLATED STATUE OF HIMSELF WHICH STOOD PROUDLY IN THE CAPITAL 'S CENTRAL SQUARE AND ROTATED TO FOLLOW THE SUN HE WAS A SLIGHTLY UNUSUAL GUY
CharmianGooch_2013G A STACK OF FABULOUS SPORTS CARS SOME COSTING A MILLION DOLLARS APIECE OH AND A GULFSTREAM JET TOO NOW GET THIS UNTIL RECENTLY HE WAS EARNING AN OFFICIAL MONTHLY SALARY OF LESS THAN SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
CharmianGooch_2013G AND THERE 'S DAN ETETE WELL HE WAS THE FORMER OIL MINISTER OF NIGERIA UNDER PRESIDENT ABACHA AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS HE 'S A CONVICTED MONEY LAUNDERER TOO WE 'VE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME INVESTIGATING A DOLLAR ONE BILLION THAT 'S RIGHT A DOLLAR
CharmianGooch_2013G SO IT 'S EASY TO THINK THAT CORRUPTION HAPPENS SOMEWHERE OVER THERE CARRIED OUT BY A BUNCH OF GREEDY DESPOTS AND INDIVIDUALS UP TO NO GOOD IN COUNTRIES THAT WE PERSONALLY MAY KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT AND FEEL REALLY UNCONNECTED TO AND UNAFFECTED BY WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON
CharmianGooch_2013G BUT DOES IT JUST HAPPEN OVER THERE
CharmianGooch_2013G SO A FEW YEARS LATER AND IT 'S NOW ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN AND I 'M IN ANGOLA UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATING BLOOD DIAMONDS PERHAPS YOU SAW THE FILM THE HOLLYWOOD FILM BLOOD DIAMOND THE ONE WITH LEONARDO DICAPRIO WELL SOME OF THAT SPRANG FROM OUR WORK
CharmianGooch_2013G SO I 'M SITTING IN A HOT AND VERY STUFFY HOTEL ROOM FEELING JUST TOTALLY OVERWHELMED BUT IT WASN 'T ABOUT BLOOD DIAMONDS BECAUSE I 'D BEEN SPEAKING TO LOTS OF PEOPLE THERE WHO WELL THEY TALKED ABOUT A DIFFERENT PROBLEM
CharmianGooch_2013G THAT OF A MASSIVE WEB OF CORRUPTION ON A GLOBAL SCALE AND MILLIONS OF OIL DOLLARS GOING MISSING
CharmianGooch_2013G AND FOR WHAT WAS THEN A VERY SMALL ORGANIZATION OF JUST A FEW PEOPLE TRYING TO EVEN BEGIN TO THINK HOW WE MIGHT TACKLE THAT WAS AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE
CharmianGooch_2013G AND IN THE YEARS THAT I 'VE BEEN AND WE 'VE ALL BEEN CAMPAIGNING AND INVESTIGATING I 'VE REPEATEDLY SEEN THAT WHAT MAKES CORRUPTION ON A GLOBAL MASSIVE SCALE POSSIBLE WELL IT ISN 'T JUST GREED OR THE MISUSE OF POWER
CharmianGooch_2013G AND AMERICAN BANKS WELL THEY FUNNELED SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE STATES SOME OF WHICH WAS USED TO BUY THAT CALIFORNIA MANSION
CharmianGooch_2013G AND HE DIDN 'T DO ALL OF THIS IN HIS OWN NAME EITHER HE USED SHELL COMPANIES HE USED ONE TO BUY THE PROPERTY AND ANOTHER WHICH WAS IN SOMEBODY ELSE 'S NAME TO PAY THE HUGE BILLS IT COST TO RUN THE PLACE
CharmianGooch_2013G AND THEN THERE 'S DAN ETETE WELL WHEN HE WAS OIL MINISTER HE AWARDED AN OIL BLOCK NOW WORTH OVER A BILLION DOLLARS TO A COMPANY THAT GUESS WHAT YEAH HE WAS THE HIDDEN OWNER OF
CharmianGooch_2013G BY THE PROBLEM OF ANONYMOUS SHELL COMPANIES AND BY THE SECRECY THAT WE HAVE AFFORDED BIG OIL GAS AND MINING OPERATIONS AND MOST OF ALL
CharmianGooch_2013G NOW LET 'S TAKE THE BANKS FIRST WELL IT 'S NOT GOING TO COME AS ANY SURPRISE FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT BANKS ACCEPT DIRTY MONEY
CharmianGooch_2013G BUT THEY PRIORITIZE THEIR PROFITS IN OTHER DESTRUCTIVE WAYS TOO FOR EXAMPLE IN SARAWAK MALAYSIA NOW THIS REGION IT HAS JUST FIVE PERCENT OF ITS FORESTS LEFT INTACT FIVE PERCENT
CharmianGooch_2013G SO HOW DID THAT HAPPEN WELL BECAUSE AN ELITE AND ITS FACILITATORS HAVE BEEN MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM SUPPORTING LOGGING ON AN INDUSTRIAL SCALE FOR MANY YEARS
CharmianGooch_2013G SO WE SENT AN UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATOR IN TO SECRETLY FILM MEETINGS WITH MEMBERS OF THE RULING ELITE
CharmianGooch_2013G AND THE RESULTING FOOTAGE WELL IT MADE SOME PEOPLE VERY ANGRY AND YOU CAN SEE THAT ON YOUTUBE BUT IT PROVED WHAT WE HAD LONG SUSPECTED BECAUSE IT SHOWED HOW THE STATE 'S CHIEF MINISTER DESPITE HIS LATER DENIALS USED HIS CONTROL OVER LAND AND FOREST LICENSES TO ENRICH HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
CharmianGooch_2013G AND HSBC WELL WE KNOW THAT HSBC BANKROLLED THE REGION 'S LARGEST LOGGING COMPANIES THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THAT DESTRUCTION IN SARAWAK AND ELSEWHERE THE BANK VIOLATED ITS OWN SUSTAINABILITY POLICIES IN THE PROCESS BUT IT EARNED AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS
CharmianGooch_2013G BUT WHAT DOESN 'T USUALLY COME TO LIGHT IS HOW SHELL COMPANIES ARE USED TO STEAL HUGE SUMS OF MONEY TRANSFORMATIONAL SUMS OF MONEY FROM POOR COUNTRIES
CharmianGooch_2013G A RECENT STUDY BY THE WORLD BANK LOOKED AT TWO HUNDRED CASES OF CORRUPTION
CharmianGooch_2013G YOU SEE SHELL COMPANIES THEY 'RE CENTRAL TO THE SECRET DEALS WHICH MAY BENEFIT WEALTHY ELITES RATHER THAN ORDINARY CITIZENS
CharmianGooch_2013G ONE STRIKING RECENT CASE THAT WE 'VE INVESTIGATED IS HOW THE GOVERNMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO SOLD OFF A SERIES OF VALUABLE STATE OWNED MINING ASSETS TO SHELL COMPANIES IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS
CharmianGooch_2013G AND WE WERE ALARMED TO FIND THAT THESE SHELL COMPANIES HAD QUICKLY FLIPPED MANY OF THE ASSETS ON FOR HUGE PROFITS TO MAJOR INTERNATIONAL MINING COMPANIES LISTED IN LONDON
CharmianGooch_2013G NOW THE AFRICA PROGRESS PANEL LED BY KOFI ANNAN THEY 'VE CALCULATED THAT CONGO MAY HAVE LOST MORE THAN ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS FROM THESE DEALS THAT 'S ALMOST TWICE THE COUNTRY 'S ANNUAL HEALTH AND EDUCATION BUDGET COMBINED
CharmianGooch_2013G WELL BECAUSE THERE 'S A LOT AT STAKE IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN NATURAL RESOURCE EXPORTS OUTWEIGHED AID FLOWS BY ALMOST NINETEEN TO ONE IN AFRICA ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA NINETEEN TO ONE
CharmianGooch_2013G NOW LET 'S GO BACK TO THE OIL AND MINING COMPANIES AND LET 'S GO BACK TO DAN ETETE AND THAT DOLLAR ONE BILLION DEAL AND NOW FORGIVE ME I 'M GOING TO READ THE NEXT BIT BECAUSE IT 'S A VERY LIVE ISSUE AND OUR LAWYERS HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS IN SOME DETAIL AND THEY WANT ME TO GET IT RIGHT
CharmianGooch_2013G NOW ON THE SURFACE THE DEAL APPEARED STRAIGHTFORWARD SUBSIDIARIES OF SHELL AND ENI PAID THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT FOR THE BLOCK
CharmianGooch_2013G AND HERE 'S THE THING AFTER MANY MONTHS OF DIGGING AROUND AND READING THROUGH HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF COURT DOCUMENTS WE FOUND EVIDENCE THAT IN FACT SHELL AND ENI HAD KNOWN THAT THE FUNDS WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THAT SHELL COMPANY
CharmianGooch_2013G AND FRANKLY IT 'S HARD TO BELIEVE THEY DIDN 'T KNOW WHO THEY WERE REALLY DEALING WITH THERE
CharmianGooch_2013G NOW IT JUST SHOULDN 'T TAKE THESE SORTS OF EFFORTS TO FIND OUT WHERE THE MONEY IN DEALS LIKE THIS WENT I MEAN THESE ARE STATE ASSETS THEY 'RE SUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY
CharmianGooch_2013G BUT IN SOME COUNTRIES CITIZENS AND JOURNALISTS WHO ARE TRYING TO EXPOSE STORIES LIKE THIS HAVE BEEN HARASSED AND ARRESTED AND SOME HAVE EVEN RISKED THEIR LIVES TO DO SO
CharmianGooch_2013G BUT AS A CAMPAIGNER AND INVESTIGATOR I HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW BECAUSE I 'VE SEEN WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN AN IDEA GAINS MOMENTUM
CharmianGooch_2013G IN THE OIL AND MINING SECTOR FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS NOW THE BEGINNING OF A TRULY WORLDWIDE TRANSPARENCY STANDARD THAT COULD TACKLE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS
CharmianGooch_2013G BUT LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS FROM AROUND THE WORLD CAME TOGETHER TO FIGHT FOR TRANSPARENCY AND NOW IT 'S FAST BECOMING THE NORM AND THE
