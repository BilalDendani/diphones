EvelynGlennie_2003 QUITE SURE WHETHER I REALLY WANT TO SEE A SNARE DRUM AT NINE O'CLOCK OR SO IN THE MORNING
EvelynGlennie_2003 ANYWAY IT'S JUST GREAT TO SEE SUCH A FULL THEATER AND REALLY I MUST THANK HERBIE HANCOCK AND HIS COLLEAGUES FOR SUCH A GREAT PRESENTATION
EvelynGlennie_2003 THE
EvelynGlennie_2003 THINGS OF COURSE IS THE COMBINATION OF THAT RAW HAND ON THE INSTRUMENT AND TECHNOLOGY
EvelynGlennie_2003 AND OF COURSE WHAT HE SAID ABOUT LISTENING TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE OF COURSE MY JOB IS ALL ABOUT LISTENING AND
EvelynGlennie_2003 MY AIM REALLY IS TO TEACH THE WORLD TO LISTEN THAT'S MY ONLY REAL AIM IN LIFE AND IT SOUNDS QUITE SIMPLE BUT ACTUALLY
EvelynGlennie_2003 IT'S QUITE A BIG BIG JOB BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU
EvelynGlennie_2003 LOOK AT A PIECE OF MUSIC FOR EXAMPLE IF I JUST OPEN
EvelynGlennie_2003 MY LITTLE MOTORBIKE BAG WE HAVE HERE HOPEFULLY A PIECE OF MUSIC
EvelynGlennie_2003 THAT IS FULL OF LITTLE BLACK DOTS ON THE PAGE AND YOU KNOW WE OPEN IT UP
EvelynGlennie_2003 AND I READ THE MUSIC SO TECHNICALLY I CAN ACTUALLY READ THIS I WILL FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS THE TEMPO MARKINGS THE DYNAMICS I WILL DO EXACTLY AS I'M TOLD
EvelynGlennie_2003 MAYBE TWO LINES OR SO
EvelynGlennie_2003 I'M BEING TOLD WHICH PART OF THE STICK TO USE AND I'M BEING TOLD THE DYNAMIC AND I'M ALSO BEING TOLD THAT THE DRUM IS WITHOUT
EvelynGlennie_2003 SNARES SNARES ON SNARES OFF SO THEREFORE IF I TRANSLATE THIS PIECE OF MUSIC WE HAVE THIS IDEA
EvelynGlennie_2003 SO ON MY CAREER WOULD PROBABLY LAST ABOUT FIVE YEARS
EvelynGlennie_2003 WHAT I HAVE TO DO AS A MUSICIAN IS DO EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT ON THE MUSIC
EvelynGlennie_2003 EVERYTHING THAT THERE ISN'T TIME TO LEARN FROM A TEACHER OR TO TALK ABOUT EVEN FROM A TEACHER
EvelynGlennie_2003 IT'S THE THINGS THAT YOU NOTICE WHEN YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY WITH YOUR INSTRUMENT THAT IN FACT BECOME SO INTERESTING AND THAT YOU WANT TO EXPLORE THROUGH THIS TINY TINY SURFACE
EvelynGlennie_2003 DRUM SO THERE WE EXPERIENCE THE TRANSLATION NOW WE'LL EXPERIENCE THE INTERPRETATION
EvelynGlennie_2003 A LITTLE LONGER BUT IN A WAY YOU KNOW IT'S THE SAME IF I LOOK AT YOU AND I SEE A NICE BRIGHT
EvelynGlennie_2003 YOUNG LADY WITH A PINK TOP ON I SEE THAT YOU'RE CLUTCHING A TEDDY BEAR ET CETERA ET CETERA SO I GET A BASIC IDEA AS TO
EvelynGlennie_2003 WHAT YOU MIGHT BE ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT LIKE WHAT YOU MIGHT DO AS A PROFESSION ET CETERA ET CETERA HOWEVER THAT'S JUST YOU KNOW THE INITIAL IDEA I MAY HAVE THAT WE ALL GET WHEN WE ACTUALLY LOOK
EvelynGlennie_2003 AND WE TRY TO INTERPRET BUT ACTUALLY IT'S SO UNBELIEVABLY SHALLOW IN THE SAME WAY I LOOK AT THE MUSIC I GET A BASIC IDEA I WONDER WHAT
EvelynGlennie_2003 HERBIE SAID PLEASE LISTEN LISTEN WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO OURSELVES FIRST OF ALL IF I PLAY FOR EXAMPLE HOLDING THE STICK WHERE LITERALLY I DO NOT LET GO OF THE STICK
EvelynGlennie_2003 MORE DYNAMIC WITH LESS EFFORT MUCH MORE
EvelynGlennie_2003 AND I JUST FEEL AT LAST ONE WITH
EvelynGlennie_2003 THE STICK AND ONE WITH THE DRUM AND I'M DOING FAR FAR LESS SO IN THE SAME WAY THAT I NEED TIME WITH THIS INSTRUMENT I NEED TIME
EvelynGlennie_2003 WITH PEOPLE IN ORDER TO INTERPRET THEM NOT JUST TRANSLATE THEM BUT INTERPRET THEM IF FOR EXAMPLE
EvelynGlennie_2003 I PLAY JUST A FEW BARS OF A PIECE OF MUSIC
EvelynGlennie_2003 FOR WHICH
EvelynGlennie_2003 I THINK OF MYSELF AS A TECHNICIAN THAT IS SOMEONE WHO IS BASICALLY A PERCUSSION PLAYER
EvelynGlennie_2003 SO ON IF I THINK OF MYSELF AS A MUSICIAN
EvelynGlennie_2003 SO ON THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENCE THERE
EvelynGlennie_2003 AND I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD AND I STARTED PLAYING TYMPANI AND PERCUSSION AND
EvelynGlennie_2003 MY TEACHER SAID WELL HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS YOU KNOW MUSIC IS ABOUT LISTENING YES I AGREE WITH
EvelynGlennie_2003 SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM AND HE SAID WELL HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HEAR THIS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HEAR THAT AND I SAID WELL HOW DO YOU HEAR IT
EvelynGlennie_2003 HE SAID WELL
EvelynGlennie_2003 I THINK I HEAR IT THROUGH HERE AND I SAID WELL I THINK I DO TOO BUT I ALSO HEAR IT THROUGH MY HANDS THROUGH MY ARMS
EvelynGlennie_2003 CHEEKBONES MY SCALP MY TUMMY MY CHEST MY LEGS AND SO ON AND SO WE BEGAN OUR LESSONS EVERY SINGLE TIME
EvelynGlennie_2003 DRUMS IN PARTICULAR THE KETTLE DRUMS OR TYMPANI TO SUCH A NARROW PITCH INTERVAL SO SOMETHING LIKE
EvelynGlennie_2003 A
EvelynGlennie_2003 IT'S AMAZING THAT WHEN YOU DO OPEN YOUR BODY UP AND OPEN YOUR HAND UP TO ALLOW THE VIBRATION TO COME THROUGH THAT IN FACT THE TINY TINY DIFFERENCE
EvelynGlennie_2003 BE FELT WITH JUST THE TINIEST PART OF YOUR FINGER THERE AND SO WHAT WE WOULD DO IS THAT I WOULD PUT MY HANDS
EvelynGlennie_2003 ON THE WALL OF THE MUSIC ROOM AND TOGETHER WE WOULD LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS OF THE INSTRUMENTS AND REALLY TRY TO CONNECT
EvelynGlennie_2003 WITH THOSE SOUNDS FAR FAR MORE BROADLY THAN SIMPLY DEPENDING ON THE EAR BECAUSE OF COURSE THE
EvelynGlennie_2003 I MEAN SUBJECT TO ALL SORTS OF THINGS THE ROOM WE HAPPEN TO BE IN THE AMPLIFICATION THE QUALITY OF THE INSTRUMENT THE TYPE OF STICKS
EvelynGlennie_2003 ALL DIFFERENT
EvelynGlennie_2003 SAME AMOUNT OF WEIGHT BUT DIFFERENT SOUND COLORS AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE ARE WE'RE JUST HUMAN BEINGS BUT WE ALL HAVE
EvelynGlennie_2003 LITTLE SOUND COLORS AS IT WERE THAT MAKE UP THESE EXTRAORDINARY PERSONALITIES AND CHARACTERS AND INTERESTS AND THINGS
EvelynGlennie_2003 AND AS I GREW OLDER I THEN AUDITIONED FOR THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF MUSIC IN LONDON AND THEY SAID WELL NO WE WON 'T ACCEPT YOU BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T A CLUE YOU KNOW OF THE FUTURE OF A SO CALLED
EvelynGlennie_2003 AND I JUST COULDN'T QUITE ACCEPT THAT AND SO THEREFORE I
EvelynGlennie_2003 SAID TO THEM WELL LOOK IF YOU
EvelynGlennie_2003 IF YOU REFUSE ME THROUGH THOSE REASONS AS OPPOSED TO THE ABILITY TO PERFORM AND TO UNDERSTAND AND LOVE
EvelynGlennie_2003 THE ART OF CREATING SOUND THEN WE HAVE TO THINK VERY VERY HARD ABOUT THE PEOPLE YOU DO ACTUALLY
EvelynGlennie_2003 AND AS A RESULT ONCE WE GOT OVER A LITTLE HURDLE AND HAVING TO AUDITION TWICE THEY ACCEPTED ME AND NOT ONLY THAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS THAT IT CHANGED THE WHOLE
EvelynGlennie_2003 ROLE OF THE MUSIC INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED KINGDOM UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WERE THEY TO REFUSE ANY APPLICATION WHATSOEVER
EvelynGlennie_2003 ON THE BASIS OF WHETHER SOMEONE HAD NO ARMS NO LEGS THEY COULD STILL PERHAPS PLAY A WIND INSTRUMENT IF IT WAS SUPPORTED ON A STAND
EvelynGlennie_2003 NO CIRCUMSTANCES AT ALL WERE USED TO REFUSE ANY ENTRY AND EVERY SINGLE ENTRY HAD TO BE LISTENED TO
EvelynGlennie_2003 EXPERIENCED AND THEN BASED ON THE MUSICAL ABILITY THEN THAT PERSON COULD EITHER ENTER OR NOT SO THEREFORE THIS
EvelynGlennie_2003 MEANT THAT THERE WAS AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING BUNCH OF STUDENTS WHO ARRIVED IN THESE VARIOUS MUSIC INSTITUTIONS
EvelynGlennie_2003 IS QUITE SIMPLY THAT NOT ONLY WERE PEOPLE CONNECTED WITH SOUND WHICH IS BASICALLY ALL OF US AND WE WELL KNOW THAT MUSIC REALLY IS
EvelynGlennie_2003 DAILY MEDICINE I SAY MUSIC BUT ACTUALLY I MEAN SOUND BECAUSE YOU KNOW SOME OF THE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS I'VE EXPERIENCED AS A MUSICIAN WHEN YOU MAY HAVE
EvelynGlennie_2003 A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD LAD WHO HAS GOT THE MOST INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL
EvelynGlennie_2003 HIS MOVEMENTS WHO MAY BE DEAF WHO MAY BE BLIND ET CETERA ET CETERA SUDDENLY IF THAT YOUNG LAD SITS CLOSE TO THIS INSTRUMENT
EvelynGlennie_2003 AND PERHAPS EVEN LIES UNDERNEATH THE MARIMBA AND YOU PLAY SOMETHING THAT'S SO INCREDIBLY ORGAN LIKE
EvelynGlennie_2003 ALMOST I DON'T REALLY HAVE THE RIGHT STICKS PERHAPS BUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS LET ME CHANGE
EvelynGlennie_2003 SO UNBELIEVABLY SIMPLE BUT HE WOULD BE EXPERIENCING SOMETHING THAT I
EvelynGlennie_2003 BECAUSE I'M ON TOP OF THE SOUND I HAVE THE SOUND COMING THIS WAY
EvelynGlennie_2003 HE WOULD HAVE THE SOUND COMING THROUGH THE RESONATORS IF THERE WERE NO RESONATORS ON HERE WE WOULD HAVE
EvelynGlennie_2003 SO HE WOULD HAVE A FULLNESS OF SOUND THAT THOSE OF YOU IN THE FRONT FEW ROWS WOULDN'T EXPERIENCE THOSE OF YOU IN THE BACK FEW ROWS WOULDN'T EXPERIENCE
EvelynGlennie_2003 WHAT TYPE OF SOUND I WANT TO PRODUCE FOR EXAMPLE THIS SOUND
EvelynGlennie_2003 CAN YOU HEAR ANYTHING EXACTLY BECAUSE I'M NOT EVEN TOUCHING IT
EvelynGlennie_2003 I MEAN JUST THIS KALEIDOSCOPE OF THINGS TO DRAW FROM SO ALL OF MY PERFORMANCES ARE BASED ON ENTIRELY WHAT I EXPERIENCE AND NOT BY
EvelynGlennie_2003 LEARNING A PIECE OF MUSIC PUTTING ON SOMEONE ELSE'S INTERPRETATION OF IT BUYING ALL THE CDS POSSIBLE OF THAT PARTICULAR PIECE OF MUSIC AND SO ON AND SO FORTH BECAUSE THAT ISN'T GIVING ME ENOUGH OF SOMETHING THAT IS SO RAW AND SO
EvelynGlennie_2003 BASIC AND SOMETHING THAT I CAN FULLY EXPERIENCE THE JOURNEY OF SO IT MAY BE THAT IN CERTAIN HALLS THIS
EvelynGlennie_2003 DYNAMIC MAY WELL
EvelynGlennie_2003 THAT IN OTHER HALLS THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT GOING TO EXPERIENCE THAT AT ALL AND SO THEREFORE MY LEVEL OF SOFT GENTLE PLAYING MAY HAVE TO BE
EvelynGlennie_2003 YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN SO BECAUSE OF THIS EXPLOSION IN ACCESS TO SOUND
EvelynGlennie_2003 ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE DEAF COMMUNITY THIS HAS NOT ONLY AFFECTED HOW MUSIC INSTITUTIONS HOW SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF
EvelynGlennie_2003 TREAT SOUND AND NOT JUST AS A MEANS OF THERAPY ALTHOUGH OF COURSE BEING A PARTICIPATOR OF MUSIC THAT DEFINITELY IS THE CASE AS WELL BUT IT'S MEANT THAT
EvelynGlennie_2003 ACOUSTICIANS HAVE HAD TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THE TYPES OF HALLS THEY PUT TOGETHER THERE ARE SO FEW HALLS IN THIS WORLD THAT ACTUALLY
EvelynGlennie_2003 HAVE VERY GOOD ACOUSTICS DARE I SAY BUT BY THAT I MEAN WHERE YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY DO ANYTHING YOU IMAGINE
EvelynGlennie_2003 THE TINIEST SOFTEST SOFTEST SOUND TO SOMETHING THAT IS SO BROAD SO HUGE SO INCREDIBLE
EvelynGlennie_2003 IS INCREDIBLE FOR WHICH YOU CAN PLAY EXACTLY WHAT YOU IMAGINE WITHOUT IT BEING
EvelynGlennie_2003 AND SO THEREFORE ACOUSTICIANS ARE ACTUALLY IN CONVERSATION WITH
EvelynGlennie_2003 PEOPLE WHO ARE HEARING IMPAIRED AND WHO ARE PARTICIPATORS OF SOUND AND THIS IS QUITE INTERESTING I CANNOT YOU KNOW GIVE YOU
EvelynGlennie_2003 DETAIL AS FAR AS WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WITH THOSE HALLS BUT IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT THEY ARE GOING TO A GROUP OF PEOPLE
EvelynGlennie_2003 IF WE SEE SOMEONE IN A WHEELCHAIR WE ASSUME THEY CANNOT WALK IT MAY BE THAT THEY CAN WALK THREE FOUR FIVE STEPS THAT TO THEM MEANS THEY CAN WALK
EvelynGlennie_2003 IN A YEAR 'S TIME IT COULD BE TWO EXTRA STEPS IN ANOTHER YEAR 'S TIME THREE EXTRA STEPS THOSE ARE HUGELY IMPORTANT ASPECTS TO THINK ABOUT
EvelynGlennie_2003 SO WHEN WE DO LISTEN TO EACH OTHER IT'S UNBELIEVABLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO REALLY
EvelynGlennie_2003 TEST OUR LISTENING SKILLS TO REALLY USE OUR BODIES AS A RESONATING CHAMBER TO STOP THE JUDGMENT
EvelynGlennie_2003 FOR ME AS A MUSICIAN WHO DEALS WITH NINETY NINE PERCENT OF NEW MUSIC IT'S VERY EASY FOR ME TO SAY OH YES I LIKE THAT PIECE OH NO I DON'T LIKE THAT PIECE AND SO ON
EvelynGlennie_2003 AND YOU KNOW I JUST FIND THAT I HAVE TO GIVE THOSE PIECES OF MUSIC REAL TIME
EvelynGlennie_2003 IT MAY BE THAT THE CHEMISTRY ISN'T QUITE RIGHT BETWEEN MYSELF AND THAT PARTICULAR PIECE OF MUSIC BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY IT'S A BAD PIECE OF MUSIC
EvelynGlennie_2003 AND YOU KNOW IT'S JUST ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT BEING A MUSICIAN IS THAT IT'S SO UNBELIEVABLY FLUID
EvelynGlennie_2003 SO THERE ARE NO RULES NO RIGHT NO WRONG THIS WAY THAT WAY IF I ASKED YOU TO
EvelynGlennie_2003 MAYBE I CAN DO THIS IF I CAN JUST SAY PLEASE CLAP AND CREATE THE SOUND OF THUNDER I'M ASSUMING WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED THUNDER
EvelynGlennie_2003 NOW I DON'T MEAN JUST THE SOUND I MEAN REALLY LISTEN TO THAT THUNDER WITHIN YOURSELVES AND PLEASE TRY TO CREATE THAT THROUGH YOUR CLAPPING TRY JUST PLEASE TRY
EvelynGlennie_2003 TRY AGAIN TRY AGAIN SNOW
EvelynGlennie_2003 YOU'RE AWAKE
EvelynGlennie_2003 YOU KNOW THE INTERESTING THING HERE THOUGH IS THAT I ASKED A GROUP OF KIDS NOT SO LONG AGO EXACTLY THE SAME QUESTION
EvelynGlennie_2003 NOW GREAT IMAGINATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH HOWEVER NOT ONE OF YOU GOT OUT OF YOUR SEATS TO THINK RIGHT HOW CAN I
EvelynGlennie_2003 IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY OTHER THAN SITTING IN YOUR SEATS THERE AND USING TWO HANDS IN THE SAME WAY THAT WHEN WE LISTEN TO MUSIC WE ASSUME THAT IT'S ALL BEING FED THROUGH HERE THIS IS HOW WE EXPERIENCE
EvelynGlennie_2003 MUSIC OF COURSE IT'S NOT WE EXPERIENCE THUNDER THUNDER THUNDER THINK THINK THINK LISTEN LISTEN LISTEN
EvelynGlennie_2003 NOW WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THUNDER I REMEMBER MY TEACHER
EvelynGlennie_2003 WHEN I FIRST STARTED MY VERY FIRST LESSON I WAS ALL PREPARED WITH STICKS READY TO GO AND INSTEAD OF HIM SAYING OK EVELYN PLEASE
EvelynGlennie_2003 SLIGHTLY APART ARMS AT A MORE OR LESS NINETY DEGREE ANGLE STICKS IN A MORE OR LESS V SHAPE
EvelynGlennie_2003 I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO STRIKE THE DRUM BECAUSE I WAS THINKING OF SO MANY OTHER THINGS HE SAID EVELYN TAKE THIS DRUM AWAY FOR SEVEN DAYS AND I'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK
EvelynGlennie_2003 SO HEAVENS WHAT WAS I TO DO I NO LONGER REQUIRED THE STICKS I WASN'T ALLOWED TO HAVE THESE STICKS I HAD TO BASICALLY LOOK
EvelynGlennie_2003 AT THIS PARTICULAR DRUM SEE HOW IT WAS MADE WHAT THESE LITTLE LUGS DID WHAT THE SNARES DID TURNED IT UPSIDE DOWN EXPERIMENTED WITH THE SHELL
EvelynGlennie_2003 HEAD
EvelynGlennie_2003 WITH ALL SORTS OF BRUISES AND THINGS LIKE
EvelynGlennie_2003 IT WAS SUCH AN UNBELIEVABLE EXPERIENCE BECAUSE THEN WHERE ON EARTH ARE YOU GOING TO EXPERIENCE THAT IN A PIECE OF MUSIC
EvelynGlennie_2003 WHERE ON EARTH ARE YOU GOING TO EXPERIENCE THAT IN A STUDY BOOK SO WE NEVER EVER DEALT WITH ACTUAL STUDY BOOKS SO
EvelynGlennie_2003 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LEARN WHEN WE ARE DEALING WITH BEING A PERCUSSION PLAYER AS OPPOSED TO A MUSICIAN IS BASICALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD SINGLE STROKE ROLLS
EvelynGlennie_2003 LIKE THAT AND THEN WE GET A LITTLE FASTER
EvelynGlennie_2003 WHAT DOES THIS PIECE REQUIRE SINGLE STROKE ROLLS
EvelynGlennie_2003 WHY CAN'T I THEN DO THAT WHILST LEARNING A PIECE OF MUSIC AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DID AND INTERESTINGLY THE OLDER I BECAME WHEN I BECAME A FULL TIME STUDENT AT A SO CALLED MUSIC INSTITUTION
EvelynGlennie_2003 ALL OF THAT WENT OUT OF THE WINDOW WE HAD TO STUDY FROM STUDY BOOKS AND CONSTANTLY THE QUESTION WELL WHY WHY WHAT IS THIS RELATING TO I NEED TO PLAY A PIECE OF MUSIC OH WELL THIS WILL HELP YOUR CONTROL
EvelynGlennie_2003 WELL HOW WHY DO I NEED TO LEARN THAT I NEED TO RELATE IT TO A PIECE OF MUSIC YOU KNOW I NEED TO SAY SOMETHING WHY AM I PRACTICING
EvelynGlennie_2003 IS IT JUST LITERALLY FOR CONTROL FOR HAND STICK CONTROL WHY AM I DOING THAT I NEED TO HAVE THE REASON AND THE REASON HAS TO BE
EvelynGlennie_2003 BY SAYING SOMETHING THROUGH THE MUSIC AND BY SAYING SOMETHING THROUGH MUSIC WHICH BASICALLY IS SOUND
EvelynGlennie_2003 WE THEN CAN REACH ALL SORTS OF THINGS TO ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE BUT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OF YOUR EMOTIONAL BAGGAGE THAT'S UP TO YOU WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH A HALL BECAUSE THAT
EvelynGlennie_2003 THEN DETERMINES WHAT AND HOW WE LISTEN TO CERTAIN THINGS I MAY FEEL SORROWFUL OR HAPPY
EvelynGlennie_2003 EXHILARATED OR ANGRY WHEN I PLAY CERTAIN PIECES OF MUSIC BUT I'M NOT NECESSARILY WANTING YOU TO FEEL EXACTLY THE SAME THING SO PLEASE THE NEXT TIME YOU GO TO A CONCERT JUST
EvelynGlennie_2003 ALLOW YOUR BODY TO OPEN UP ALLOW YOUR BODY TO BE THIS RESONATING CHAMBER BE AWARE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME THING
EvelynGlennie_2003 AS THE PERFORMER IS THE PERFORMER IS IN THE WORST POSSIBLE POSITION FOR THE ACTUAL SOUND THEY'RE HEARING THE CONTACT OF THE STICK ON
EvelynGlennie_2003 THE DRUM OR THE MALLET ON THE BIT OF WOOD OR THE
EvelynGlennie_2003 THE STRING ET CETERA
EvelynGlennie_2003 WHICH IS BEFORE THE SOUND IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING PLEASE TAKE NOTE OF THE LIFE OF THE SOUND AFTER THE ACTUAL INITIAL STRIKE OR
EvelynGlennie_2003 IS BEING PULLED JUST EXPERIENCE THE WHOLE JOURNEY OF THAT SOUND IN THE SAME WAY THAT I WISHED I'D EXPERIENCED THE WHOLE JOURNEY OF THIS PARTICULAR CONFERENCE RATHER THAN JUST ARRIVING
EvelynGlennie_2003 LAST NIGHT I HOPE MAYBE WE CAN SHARE ONE OR TWO THINGS AS THE DAY PROGRESSES BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING
