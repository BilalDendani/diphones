BeatriceCoron_2011 I AM A PAPERCUTTER
BeatriceCoron_2011 IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD
BeatriceCoron_2011 I TAKE A PIECE OF PAPER I VISUALIZE MY STORY SOMETIMES I SKETCH SOMETIMES I DON 'T
BeatriceCoron_2011 I SEE IT MORE AS A SPIRAL
BeatriceCoron_2011 I WAS NOT BORN WITH A BLADE IN MY HAND AND I DON 'T REMEMBER PAPERCUTTING AS A CHILD
BeatriceCoron_2011 AS A TEENAGER I WAS SKETCHING DRAWING AND I WANTED TO BE AN ARTIST BUT I WAS ALSO A REBEL AND I LEFT EVERYTHING AND WENT FOR A LONG SERIES OF ODD JOBS SO AMONG THEM
BeatriceCoron_2011 ONE YEAR IN EGYPT
BeatriceCoron_2011 I MOVED FOR TWO YEARS IN TAIWAN AND THEN I SETTLED IN NEW YORK WHERE I BECAME A TOUR GUIDE
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND I STILL WORKED AS A TOUR LEADER TRAVELED BACK AND FORTH IN CHINA TIBET AND CENTRAL ASIA SO OF COURSE IT TOOK TIME AND I WAS NEARLY FORTY AND I DECIDED IT 'S TIME TO START AS AN ARTIST APPLAUSE I
BeatriceCoron_2011 BECAUSE GRAPHICALLY IT 'S VERY EFFICIENT AND IT 'S ALSO
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND PEOPLE TOLD ME LIKE THESE THIRTY SIX VIEWS OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING THEY TOLD ME YOU 'RE MAKING ARTIST BOOKS
BeatriceCoron_2011 SO ARTIST BOOKS HAVE A LOT OF DEFINITIONS THEY COME IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT SHAPES BUT TO ME THEY ARE FASCINATING OBJECTS TO VISUALLY NARRATE A STORY
BeatriceCoron_2011 THEY CAN BE WITH WORDS
BeatriceCoron_2011 OR WITHOUT WORDS
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND MY DAILY LANGUAGE IS ENGLISH SO I DID A SERIES OF WORK
BeatriceCoron_2011 SO THIS SPIDER GOES THROUGH THE WHOLE ALPHABET WITH IDENTICAL ADJECTIVES AND SUBSTANTIVES SO IF YOU DON 'T KNOW ONE OF THESE LANGUAGES IT 'S INSTANT LEARNING
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND ONE ANCIENT FORM OF THE BOOK IS SCROLLS SO SCROLLS ARE VERY CONVENIENT
BeatriceCoron_2011 BECAUSE YOU CAN CREATE A LARGE IMAGE ON A VERY SMALL TABLE
BeatriceCoron_2011 SO THE UNEXPECTED CONSEQUENCES OF THAT IS THAT YOU ONLY SEE ONE PART OF YOUR IMAGE SO IT MAKES A VERY FREESTYLE ARCHITECTURE
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND I 'M MAKING ALL THOSE KINDS OF WINDOWS SO IT 'S TO LOOK BEYOND THE SURFACE IT 'S TO HAVE A LOOK AT DIFFERENT WORLDS AND VERY OFTEN I 'VE BEEN AN OUTSIDER SO I WANT TO SEE HOW THINGS WORK AND WHAT 'S HAPPENING SO EACH WINDOW
BeatriceCoron_2011 IT 'S ALL IF SO WHAT IF WE WERE
BeatriceCoron_2011 LIVING IN BALLOON HOUSES IT WOULD MAKE A VERY UPLIFTING WORLD
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND WE WOULD LEAVE A VERY LOW FOOTPRINT ON THE PLANET
BeatriceCoron_2011 IT WOULD BE SO LIGHT SO
BeatriceCoron_2011 IT 'S A GLOBAL VIEW TO SEE OUR COMMON ROOTS
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND HOW WE CAN USE THEM TO CATCH DREAMS AND WE CAN USE THEM ALSO AS A SAFETY NET AND
BeatriceCoron_2011 MY INSPIRATIONS
BeatriceCoron_2011 ARE VERY ECLECTIC
BeatriceCoron_2011 HERE IT 'S CANDYCITY IT 'S A NON SUGAR COATED HISTORY OF SUGAR
BeatriceCoron_2011 WITH SOME SWEET MOMENTS IN BETWEEN
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND SOMETIMES I HAVE AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO NEWS SUCH AS THE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN HAITIAN EARTHQUAKE
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND I CREATE A MINDSCAPE
BeatriceCoron_2011 I CHANNEL THEIR HISTORY SO THAT THEY HAVE A PLACE TO GO BACK TO LOOK AT THEIR LIFE
BeatriceCoron_2011 MAD GROWTH ON COLUMBUS CIRCLE
BeatriceCoron_2011 A WEB OF TIME
BeatriceCoron_2011 DAILY BATTLES
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND AT ONE POINT I HAD TO DO THE WHOLE NINE YARDS SO IT 'S ACTUALLY A PAPERCUT THAT 'S NINE YARDS LONG
BeatriceCoron_2011 I WAS ALSO INTERESTED IN THE PHYSICALITY OF THIS FORMAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO WALK TO SEE IT
BeatriceCoron_2011 IT 'S JUST THE TRAINING TO BECOME A LONG DISTANCE PAPERCUTTER
BeatriceCoron_2011 HERE IS A THREE WEEK PAPERCUTTING MARATHON AT THE MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN IN NEW YORK CITY THE RESULT IS HELLS AND HEAVENS IT 'S TWO PANELS THIRTEEN FT HIGH THEY WERE INSTALLED IN THE MUSEUM ON
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND AGAINST ALL ODDS THEY MAKE IT TO HEAVENS OTHER PEOPLE MAKE THE OPPOSITE TRIP THAT 'S THE BORDER YOU HAVE SWEATSHOPS IN HELLS YOU HAVE PEOPLE RENTING THEIR WINGS IN THE HEAVENS
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND THEN YOU HAVE ALL THOSE INDIVIDUAL STORIES WHERE SOMETIMES WE EVEN HAVE THE SAME ACTION AND THE RESULT PUTS YOU IN HELLS OR IN HEAVENS SO THE WHOLE HELLS AND HEAVENS IS ABOUT FREE
BeatriceCoron_2011 HERE IT 'S AN ARTIST BOOK INSTALLATION CALLED IDENTITY PROJECT
BeatriceCoron_2011 IT 'S NOT AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL IDENTITIES THEY ARE MORE OUR SOCIAL IDENTITIES AND THEN YOU CAN JUST WALK BEHIND THEM AND TRY THEM ON SO IT 'S LIKE THE DIFFERENT LAYERS OF WHAT WE ARE MADE OF
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND WHAT WE PRESENT TO THE WORLD AS AN IDENTITY THAT 'S ANOTHER ARTIST BOOK PROJECT IN FACT IN THE PICTURE YOU HAVE TWO OF THEM IT 'S ONE I 'M WEARING AND ONE THAT 'S ON EXHIBITION AT THE CENTER FOR BOOKS ARTS IN NEW YORK CITY
BeatriceCoron_2011 WHY DO I CALL IT A BOOK
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND ALSO BECAUSE THE DEFINITION OF ARTIST BOOK IS VERY GENEROUS SO ARTIST BOOKS YOU TAKE THEM OFF THE WALL YOU TAKE THEM FOR A WALK YOU CAN ALSO INSTALL THEM AS PUBLIC ART
BeatriceCoron_2011 HERE IT 'S IN SCOTTSDALE ARIZONA AND IT 'S CALLED FLOATING MEMORIES SO IT 'S REGIONAL MEMORIES
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND THEY ARE JUST RANDOMLY MOVED BY THE WIND
BeatriceCoron_2011 I LOVE PUBLIC ART
BeatriceCoron_2011 I MADE AN ARTIST BOOK
BeatriceCoron_2011 THAT 'S IN STAINLESS STEEL INSTEAD OF PAPER I CALLED IT WORKING IN THE SAME DIRECTION BUT I ADDED WEATHERVANES ON BOTH SIDES TO SHOW THAT THEY COVER ALL DIRECTIONS
BeatriceCoron_2011 SO FOR THE SUBWAY IN NEW YORK I SAW A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN RIDING THE SUBWAY AND READING IT IS TRAVEL IN TIME TRAVEL ON TIME AND BRONX LITERATURE IT 'S ALL ABOUT BRONX WRITERS AND THEIR STORIES
BeatriceCoron_2011 FOR THE OHLONE INDIAN CIVILIZATION THEN
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND ON THE BRANCHES YOU HAVE
BeatriceCoron_2011 LIBRARY MATERIAL GROWING YOU CAN ALSO HAVE
BeatriceCoron_2011 FUNCTION AND FORM WITH PUBLIC ART
BeatriceCoron_2011 SO IN AURORA COLORADO IT 'S A BENCH BUT YOU HAVE A BONUS WITH THIS BENCH BECAUSE IF YOU SIT A LONG TIME IN SUMMER IN SHORTS
BeatriceCoron_2011 YOU WILL WALK AWAY
BeatriceCoron_2011 IT 'S A STORY ABOUT TRANSFORMATION AND CONNECTIONS SO IT ACTS AS A SCREEN TO PROTECT THE RAIL AND THE COMMUTER AND NOT TO HAVE OBJECTS FALLING ON THE RAILS TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE FENCES
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND WINDOW GUARDS
BeatriceCoron_2011 INTO FLOWERS IT 'S FANTASTIC
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND HERE I 'VE BEEN WORKING FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS WITH A SOUTH BRONX DEVELOPER
BeatriceCoron_2011 TO BRING ART TO LIFE TO LOW INCOME BUILDINGS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO EACH BUILDING HAS ITS OWN PERSONALITY
BeatriceCoron_2011 I CREATED ALL AROUND TOWN IT IS A PAPERCUTTING AND THEN AFTER I ADDED COLOR ON THE COMPUTER SO I CAN CALL IT TECHNO CRAFTED AND ALONG THE WAY
BeatriceCoron_2011 I DON 'T KNOW THE STORIES I TAKE IMAGES FROM OUR GLOBAL IMAGINATION FROM CLICHE FROM THINGS WE ARE THINKING ABOUT FROM HISTORY
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND EVERYBODY 'S A NARRATOR BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS A STORY TO TELL BUT MORE IMPORTANT IS EVERYBODY HAS TO MAKE A STORY TO MAKE SENSE OF THE WORLD
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND IN ALL THESE UNIVERSES IT 'S LIKE IMAGINATION IS THE VEHICLE TO BE TRANSPORTED WITH BUT THE DESTINATION IS OUR MINDS
BeatriceCoron_2011 AND HOW WE CAN RECONNECT WITH THE ESSENTIAL AND WITH THE MAGIC
