HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I THE
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I WAY I FEEL RIGHT NOW IS THAT ALL OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS HAVE SAID EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED TO SAY
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I AND IT SEEMS THAT THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR ME TO SAY IS TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR KINDNESS
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I MAYBE IN THE SPIRIT OF APPRECIATING THE KINDNESS OF YOU ALL I COULD SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE STORY ABOUT MYSELF
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I FROM THE TIME I WAS VERY YOUNG ONWARD I WAS GIVEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES AND IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG THAT EVERYTHING WAS LAID OUT BEFORE ME ALL OF THE PLANS FOR ME WERE ALREADY MADE
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I I WAS GIVEN THE CLOTHES THAT I NEEDED TO WEAR AND TOLD WHERE I NEEDED TO BE GIVEN THESE VERY PRECIOUS AND HOLY LOOKING ROBES TO WEAR WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WAS SOMETHING SACRED OR IMPORTANT
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I BUT BEFORE THAT KIND OF FORMAL LIFESTYLE HAPPENED FOR ME I WAS LIVING IN EASTERN TIBET WITH MY FAMILY AND WHEN I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD ALL OF A SUDDEN A SEARCH PARTY ARRIVED AT MY HOME
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I THEY WERE LOOKING THE NEXT KARMAPA AND I NOTICED THEY WERE TALKING TO MY MOM AND DAD AND THE NEWS CAME TO ME THAT THEY WERE TELLING ME THAT I WAS THE KARMAPA
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I AND THESE DAYS PEOPLE ASK ME A LOT HOW DID THAT FEEL HOW DID THAT FEEL WHEN THEY CAME AND WHISKED YOU AWAY AND YOUR LIFESTYLE COMPLETELY CHANGED
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I AND WHAT I MOSTLY SAY IS THAT AT THAT TIME IT WAS A PRETTY INTERESTING IDEA TO ME I THOUGHT THAT THINGS WOULD BE PRETTY FUN AND THERE WOULD BE MORE THINGS TO PLAY WITH
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I BUT IT DIDN'T TURN OUT TO BE SO FUN AND ENTERTAINING AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN I WAS PLACED IN A PRETTY STRICTLY CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AND
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I IMMEDIATELY A LOT OF DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES IN TERMS OF MY EDUCATION AND SO FORTH WERE HEAPED UPON ME
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I I WAS SEPARATED LARGELY FROM MY FAMILY INCLUDING MY MOTHER AND FATHER I DIDN'T HAVE HAVE MANY PERSONAL FRIENDS TO SPEND TIME WITH BUT I WAS EXPECTED TO PERFORM THESE
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I DUTIES SO IT TURNED OUT THAT MY FANTASY ABOUT AN ENTERTAINING LIFE OF BEING THE KARMAPA WASN'T GOING TO COME TRUE
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I MORE FELT TO BE THE CASE TO ME THAT I WAS BEING TREATED LIKE A STATUE AND I WAS TO SIT IN ONE PLACE LIKE A STATUE WOULD
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I NEVERTHELESS I FELT THAT EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN SEPARATED FROM MY LOVED ONES AND OF COURSE NOW I'M EVEN FURTHER AWAY WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN I ESCAPED FROM TIBET AND BECAME EVEN
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I FURTHER REMOVED FROM MY MOTHER AND FATHER MY RELATIVES MY FRIENDS AND MY HOMELAND BUT
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I FOR THESE PEOPLE I FEEL STILL A VERY STRONG CONNECTION OF LOVE FOR ALL OF THESE PEOPLE AND FOR THE LAND
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I AND
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I I STILL DO GET TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH MY MOTHER AND FATHER ALBEIT INFREQUENTLY I TALK TO MY MOTHER ONCE IN A BLUE MOON ON THE TELEPHONE
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I AND MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT WHEN I'M TALKING TO HER WITH EVERY SECOND THAT PASSES DURING OUR CONVERSATION THE FEELING OF LOVE THAT BINDS US IS BRINGING US CLOSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I SO THOSE WERE JUST A FEW REMARKS ABOUT MY PERSONAL BACKGROUND AND IN TERMS OF OTHER THINGS THAT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU IN TERMS OF IDEAS
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE A SITUATION LIKE THIS WHERE SO MANY PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND PLACES CAN COME TOGETHER EXCHANGE THEIR IDEAS AND FORM RELATIONSHIPS OF FRIENDSHIP WITH EACH OTHER
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I AND I THINK THAT'S SYMBOLIC OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE WORLD IN GENERAL THAT THE WORLD IS BECOMING SMALLER AND SMALLER AND THAT ALL OF THE PEOPLES IN THE WORLD ARE ENJOYING MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONNECTION
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I THAT'S WONDERFUL BUT WE SHOULD ALSO REMEMBER THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A SIMILAR PROCESS HAPPENING ON THE INSIDE ALONG WITH OUTWARD DEVELOPMENT AND INCREASE OF OPPORTUNITY
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I THERE SHOULD BE INWARD DEVELOPMENT AND DEEPENING OF OUR HEART CONNECTIONS AS WELL AS OUR OUTWARD CONNECTIONS
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I SO WE SPOKE AND WE HEARD SOME ABOUT DESIGN THIS WEEK I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER THAT WE NEED TO KEEP PUSHING FORWARD ON THE ENDEAVOR OF THE DESIGN OF THE HEART
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT TECHNOLOGY THIS WEEK AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER TO INVEST A LOT OF OUR ENERGY IN IMPROVING THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE HEART
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I SO EVEN THOUGH I'M SOMEWHAT HAPPY ABOUT THE WONDERFUL DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE WORLD STILL I FEEL A SENSE OF IMPEDIMENT WHEN IT COMES TO
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I THE ABILITY THAT WE HAVE TO CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER ON A HEART TO HEART OR A MIND TO MIND LEVEL I FEEL THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE GETTING IN THE WAY
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I MY RELATIONSHIP TO THIS CONCEPT OF HEART TO HEART CONNECTION OR MIND TO MIND CONNECTION IS AN INTERESTING ONE BECAUSE AS A SPIRITUAL LEADER I'M ALWAYS ATTEMPTING TO OPEN MY HEART TO OTHERS AND
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I OFFER MYSELF UP FOR HEART TO HEART AND MIND TO MIND CONNECTIONS IN A GENUINE WAY WITH OTHER PEOPLE BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ADVISED THAT I NEED TO EMPHASIZE INTELLIGENCE OVER THE HEART TO HEART CONNECTIONS BECAUSE
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I BEING SOMEONE IN A POSITION LIKE MINE IF I DON'T RELY PRIMARILY ON INTELLIGENCE THEN SOMETHING DANGEROUS MAY HAPPEN TO ME SO IT'S AN INTERESTING PARADOX AT PLAY THERE BUT
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I I HAD A REALLY STRIKING EXPERIENCE ONCE WHEN A GROUP FROM AFGHANISTAN CAME TO VISIT ME AND WE HAD A REALLY INTERESTING CONVERSATION
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I SO WE ENDED UP TALKING ABOUT THE BAMIYAN BUDDHAS WHICH AS YOU KNOW WERE DESTROYED SOME YEARS AGO IN AFGHANISTAN
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I BUT THE BASIS OF OUR CONVERSATION WAS THE DIFFERENT APPROACH TO SPIRITUALITY ON THE PART OF THE MUSLIM AND BUDDHIST TRADITIONS OF COURSE IN MUSLIM
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I BECAUSE OF THE TEACHINGS AROUND THE CONCEPT OF IDOLATRY YOU DON'T FIND AS MANY PHYSICAL REPRESENTATIONS OF DIVINITY OR OF SPIRITUAL LIBERATION AS YOU DO IN THE BUDDHIST TRADITION WHERE OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY STATUES OF THE BUDDHA THAT ARE
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I HIGHLY REVERED SO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TRADITIONS AND
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I WHAT MANY PEOPLE PERCEIVED AS THE TRAGEDY OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BAMIYAN BUDDHAS BUT I OFFERED THE SUGGESTION THAT PERHAPS WE COULD LOOK AT THIS IN A POSITIVE WAY
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I WHAT WE SAW IN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BAMIYAN BUDDHAS WAS THE DEPLETION OF MATTER
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I SOME SOLID SUBSTANCE FALLING DOWN AND DISINTEGRATING MAYBE WE COULD LOOK AT THAT TO BE MORE SIMILAR TO THE FALLING OF THE BERLIN WALL
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I WHERE A DIVIDE THAT HAD KEPT TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE APART HAD COLLAPSED AND OPENED UP A DOOR FOR FURTHER COMMUNICATION
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I SO I THINK THAT IN THIS WAY IT'S ALWAYS POSSIBLE FOR US TO DERIVE SOMETHING POSITIVE THAT CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER BETTER
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I SO WITH REGARD TO THE DEVELOPMENT THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE AT THIS CONFERENCE I REALLY FEEL THAT
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I THE DEVELOPMENT THAT WE MAKE SHOULDN 'T CREATE A FURTHER BURDEN FOR US AS HUMAN BEINGS BUT SHOULD BE USED
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I TO IMPROVE OUR FUNDAMENTAL LIFESTYLE OF HOW WE LIVE IN THE WORLD
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I OF COURSE I REJOICE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE GROWTH AND THE RISE OF THE NOBLE LAND OF INDIA THE GREAT COUNTRY OF INDIA
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK AS SOME OF US HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED WE NEED TO BE AWARE THAT SOME ASPECTS OF THIS RISE ARE
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I COMING AT THE COST OF THE VERY GROUND ON WHICH WE STAND SO AS WE ARE CLIMBING THE TREE
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING IN ORDER TO CLIMB THE TREE ARE ACTUALLY UNDERMINING THE TREE 'S VERY ROOT AND SO
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I I THINK IT COMES DOWN TO IS A QUESTION OF NOT ONLY HAVING INFORMATION OF WHAT'S GOING ON BUT PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I LETTING THAT SHIFT OUR MOTIVATION TO BECOME MORE SINCERE AND GENUINELY POSITIVE
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I WE HAVE HEAR THIS WEEK ABOUT THE HORRIBLE SUFFERINGS FOR EXAMPLE THAT SO MANY WOMEN OF THE WORLD ARE ENDURING DAY
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I A SHIFT IN OUR HEARTS SO I THINK THE WAY FORWARD FOR THE WORLD ONE THAT WILL BRING THE PATH OF OUTER DEVELOPMENT IN HARMONY WITH
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I THE REAL ROOT OF HAPPINESS IS THAT WE ALLOW THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY MAKE A CHANGE IN OUR
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I SO I THINK THAT SINCERE MOTIVATION IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR FUTURE WELL BEING OR DEEP SENSE OF WELL BEING AS HUMANS
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I AND I THINK THAT MEANS SINKING IN TO WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE DOING NOW WHATEVER WORK YOU'RE TRYING TO DO NOW TO BENEFIT THE WORLD SINK INTO THAT GET A FULL TASTE OF THAT
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I SO SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE THIS WEEK WE'VE TAKEN MILLIONS OF BREATHS COLLECTIVELY AND PERHAPS
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I WE HAVEN'T WITNESSED ANY COURSE CHANGES HAPPENING IN OUR LIVES BUT WE OFTEN MISS THE VERY SUBTLE CHANGES AND I THINK THAT
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I BUT THAT IF WE PAY ATTENTION WE CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE LITTLE SYMBOLS OF HAPPINESS IN EVERY BREATH THAT WE TAKE
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I SO EVERY ONE OF YOU WHO HAS COME HERE IS SO TALENTED AND YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO OFFER TO THE WORLD
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD NOTE TO CONCLUDE ON THEN TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO APPRECIATE HOW FORTUNATE WE ARE
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I TO HAVE COME TOGETHER IN THIS WAY AND EXCHANGED IDEAS AND REALLY FORM A STRONG ASPIRATION AND ENERGY WITHIN OURSELVES THAT WE WILL TAKE THE GOOD
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I THAT HAS COME FROM THIS CONFERENCE THE MOMENTUM THE POSITIVITY AND WE WILL SPREAD THAT AND PLANT IT IN ALL OF THE CORNERS OF THE WORLD
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I THE KARMAPA TOMORROW IS
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I AND I WAS SOMEWHAT RESISTANT AT TIMES AND I WAS ALSO VERY NERVOUS THROUGHOUT THIS WEEK I WAS FEELING UNDER THE WEATHER AND DIZZY AND SO FORTH AND PEOPLE WOULD ASK ME WHY
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I I WOULD TELL THEM IT 'S BECAUSE I HAVE TO TALK TOMORROW AND SO LAKSHMI HAD TO PUT UP WITH
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I ME THROUGH ALL OF THAT BUT I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY SHE'S GIVEN ME TO BE HERE
