JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@14.15:27.86 I REALLY AM HONORED TO BE HERE AND AS CHRIS SAID IT'S BEEN OVER TWENTY YEARS SINCE I STARTED WORKING IN AFRICA MY FIRST INTRODUCTION WAS AT THE ABIDJAN AIRPORT ON A SWEATY IVORY COAST MORNING I HAD JUST LEFT WALL STREET CUT MY HAIR TO LOOK LIKE MARGARET MEAD
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@42.42:50.10 BUT LITERALLY WITHIN DAYS OF ARRIVING I WAS TOLD IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS BY A NUMBER OF WEST AFRICAN WOMEN THAT
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@51.13:59.78 DIDN'T WANT SAVING THANK YOU VERY MUCH LEAST OF ALL NOT BY ME I WAS TOO YOUNG UNMARRIED I HAD NO CHILDREN DIDN'T REALLY KNOW AFRICA AND BESIDES MY FRENCH WAS PITIFUL
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@61.42:71.71 IT WAS AN INCREDIBLY PAINFUL TIME IN MY LIFE AND YET IT REALLY STARTED TO GIVE ME THE HUMILITY TO START LISTENING I THINK THAT FAILURE CAN BE AN INCREDIBLY MOTIVATING FORCE AS WELL
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@83.28:89.83 AND I DID AND WE ENDED UP NAMING IT DUTERIMBERE MEANING TO GO FORWARD WITH ENTHUSIASM AND WHILE WE WERE DOING IT I
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@109.97:118.80 AND IT WAS REALLY THE BEGINNING OF MY UNDERSTANDING THE POWER OF LANGUAGE AND HOW WHAT WE CALL PEOPLE SO OFTEN DISTANCES US FROM THEM AND MAKES THEM LITTLE
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@119.79:128.59 I ALSO FOUND OUT THAT THE BAKERY WAS NOTHING LIKE A BUSINESS THAT IN FACT IT WAS A CLASSIC CHARITY RUN BY A WELL INTENTIONED PERSON WHO
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@139.07:147.85 SO I MADE A DEAL WITH THE WOMEN I SAID LOOK WE GET RID OF THE CHARITY SIDE AND WE RUN THIS AS A BUSINESS AND I'LL HELP YOU THEY NERVOUSLY AGREED I NERVOUSLY STARTED
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@148.43:156.38 AND OF COURSE THINGS ARE ALWAYS HARDER THAN YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE FIRST OF ALL I THOUGHT WELL WE NEED A SALES TEAM AND WE CLEARLY AREN'T THE A TEAM HERE SO
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@157.26:166.49 LET 'S I DID ALL THIS TRAINING AND THE EPITOME WAS WHEN I LITERALLY MARCHED INTO THE STREETS OF NYAMIRAMBO WHICH IS THE POPULAR QUARTER OF KIGALI WITH A BUCKET AND I SOLD
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@167.05:177.82 ALL THESE LITTLE DOUGHNUTS TO PEOPLE AND I CAME BACK AND I WAS LIKE YOU SEE AND THE WOMEN SAID YOU KNOW JACQUELINE WHO IN NYAMIRAMBO IS NOT GOING TO BUY DOUGHNUTS OUT OF AN ORANGE BUCKET FROM A TALL AMERICAN WOMAN AND
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@181.07:187.87 I WENT THE WHOLE AMERICAN WAY WITH COMPETITIONS TEAM AND INDIVIDUAL COMPLETELY FAILED BUT OVER TIME THE WOMEN LEARNT TO SELL
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@188.17:201.08 ON THEIR OWN WAY AND THEY STARTED LISTENING TO THE MARKETPLACE AND THEY CAME BACK WITH IDEAS FOR CASSAVA CHIPS AND BANANA CHIPS AND SORGHUM BREAD AND BEFORE YOU KNEW IT WE HAD CORNERED THE KIGALI MARKET AND THE WOMEN WERE EARNING THREE TO FOUR TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@201.91:208.49 THAT CONFIDENCE SURGE I THOUGHT WELL IT'S TIME TO CREATE A REAL BAKERY SO LET 'S PAINT IT AND THE WOMEN SAID THAT 'S A REALLY GREAT IDEA
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@228.85:237.85 BROUGHT GAUDENCE THE RECALCITRANT ONE OF ALL AND WE BROUGHT ALL THIS PAINT AND FABRIC TO MAKE CURTAINS AND ON PAINTING DAY WE ALL GATHERED IN NYAMIRAMBO AND
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@238.46:252.07 THE IDEA WAS WE WOULD PAINT IT WHITE WITH BLUE AS TRIM LIKE A LITTLE FRENCH BAKERY BUT THAT WAS CLEARLY NOT AS SATISFYING AS PAINTING A WALL OF BLUE LIKE A MORNING SKY SO BLUE BLUE EVERYTHING BECAME BLUE THE WALLS WERE BLUE THE WINDOWS WERE BLUE THE SIDEWALK OUT FRONT
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@252.72:264.72 WAS PAINTED BLUE AND ARETHA FRANKLIN WAS SHOUTING R E S P E C T THE WOMEN 'S HIPS WERE SWAYING AND LITTLE KIDS WERE TRYING TO GRAB THE PAINTBRUSHES BUT IT WAS THEIR DAY AND AT THE END OF IT WE STOOD ACROSS THE STREET
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@265.08:273.02 AND WE LOOKED AT WHAT WE HAD DONE AND I SAID IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND THE WOMEN SAID IT REALLY IS AND I SAID AND I THINK THE COLOR IS PERFECT
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@273.43:280.06 AND THEY ALL NODDED THEIR HEAD EXCEPT FOR GAUDENCE AND I SAID WHAT AND SHE SAID NOTHING AND I SAID WHAT AND SHE SAID
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@280.55:290.04 WELL IT IS PRETTY BUT YOU KNOW OUR COLOR REALLY IT IS GREEN AND AND I LEARNED THEN
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@290.55:299.45 THAT LISTENING ISN'T JUST ABOUT PATIENCE BUT THAT WHEN YOU'VE LIVED ON CHARITY AND DEPENDENT YOUR WHOLE LIFE LONG IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@301.08:312.87 AND MOSTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE NEVER REALLY ASK YOU AND WHEN THEY DO YOU DON'T REALLY THINK THEY WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH AND SO THEN I LEARNED THAT LISTENING IS NOT ONLY ABOUT WAITING BUT IT'S ALSO LEARNING HOW BETTER TO ASK QUESTIONS
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@314.03:321.14 AND SO I LIVED IN KIGALI FOR ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS DOING THESE TWO THINGS AND IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY TIME IN MY LIFE AND IT TAUGHT ME
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@321.63:330.48 THREE LESSONS THAT I THINK ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR US TODAY AND CERTAINLY IN THE WORK THAT I DO THE FIRST IS THAT DIGNITY IS MORE IMPORTANT TO THE HUMAN SPIRIT THAN WEALTH
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@331.39:343.61 AS ELENI HAS SAID WHEN PEOPLE GAIN INCOME THEY GAIN CHOICE AND THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO DIGNITY BUT AS HUMAN BEINGS WE ALSO WANT TO SEE EACH OTHER AND WE WANT TO BE HEARD BY EACH OTHER AND WE SHOULD NEVER FORGET THAT
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@344.15:352.20 THE SECOND IS THAT TRADITIONAL CHARITY AND AID ARE NEVER GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF POVERTY I THINK ANDREW PRETTY WELL COVERED THAT SO I WILL MOVE TO THE THIRD POINT
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@352.59:359.20 WHICH IS THAT MARKETS ALONE ALSO ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF POVERTY YES WE RAN THIS AS A BUSINESS
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@359.90:369.42 BUT SOMEONE NEEDED TO PAY THE PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT THAT CAME INTO THE TRAINING AND THE MANAGEMENT SUPPORT THE STRATEGIC ADVICE AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@370.04:379.73 THE ACCESS TO NEW CONTACTS NETWORKS AND NEW MARKETS AND SO ON A MICRO LEVEL THERE'S A REAL ROLE FOR THIS COMBINATION OF INVESTMENT
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@379.99:390.73 AND PHILANTHROPY AND ON A MACRO LEVEL SOME OF THE SPEAKERS HAVE INFERRED THAT EVEN HEALTH SHOULD BE PRIVATIZED BUT HAVING HAD A FATHER WITH HEART DISEASE AND REALIZING THAT
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@392.23:402.69 WHAT OUR FAMILY COULD AFFORD WAS NOT WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN AND HAVING A GOOD FRIEND STEP IN TO HELP I REALLY BELIEVE THAT ALL PEOPLE DESERVE ACCESS TO HEALTH
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@403.15:411.61 AT PRICES THEY CAN AFFORD I THINK THE MARKET CAN HELP US FIGURE THAT OUT BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE A CHARITABLE COMPONENT OR I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO CREATE THE KIND OF SOCIETIES WE WANT TO LIVE IN
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@423.23:432.74 IT ESSENTIALLY RAISES CHARITABLE FUNDS FROM INDIVIDUALS FOUNDATIONS AND CORPORATIONS AND THEN WE TURN AROUND AND WE INVEST EQUITY AND LOANS IN BOTH FOR PROFIT AND NONPROFIT ENTITIES
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@455.86:468.91 I WANT TO TELL YOU TWO STORIES BOTH OF THEM ARE IN AFRICA BOTH OF THEM ARE ABOUT INVESTING IN ENTREPRENEURS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO SERVICE AND WHO REALLY KNOW THE MARKETS BOTH OF THEM LIVE AT THE CONFLUENCE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENTERPRISE
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@469.36:479.15 AND BOTH OF THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE MANUFACTURERS CREATE JOBS DIRECTLY AND CREATE INCOMES INDIRECTLY BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE MALARIA SECTOR AND AFRICA LOSES ABOUT THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@479.73:484.15 BECAUSE OF MALARIA AND SO AS PEOPLE GET HEALTHIER THEY ALSO GET WEALTHIER
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@485.08:492.15 THE FIRST ONE IS CALLED ADVANCED BIO EXTRACTS LIMITED IT'S A COMPANY BUILT IN KENYA ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO BY AN INCREDIBLE ENTREPRENEUR
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@501.65:509.80 IS AN ARTEMISIA PLANT IT'S THE BASIC COMPONENT FOR ARTEMISININ WHICH IS THE BEST KNOWN TREATMENT FOR MALARIA IT'S INDIGENOUS TO CHINA AND THE FAR EAST
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@511.18:524.98 BUT GIVEN THAT THE PREVALENCE OF MALARIA IS HERE IN AFRICA PATRICK AND HIS COLLEAGUES SAID LET 'S BRING IT HERE BECAUSE IT'S A HIGH VALUE ADD PRODUCT THE FARMERS GET THREE TO FOUR TIMES THE YIELDS THAT THEY WOULD WITH MAIZE
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@525.43:534.54 AND SO USING PATIENT CAPITAL MONEY THAT THEY COULD RAISE EARLY ON THAT ACTUALLY GOT BELOW MARKET RETURNS AND WAS WILLING TO GO THE LONG HAUL AND BE COMBINED
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@535.22:545.61 WITH MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE STRATEGIC ASSISTANCE THEY'VE NOW CREATED A COMPANY WHERE THEY PURCHASE FROM SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FARMERS SO THAT'S ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AFFECTED AND I THINK SOME OF YOU MAY
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@565.05:572.96 WORKING WITH ABE FOR THE PAST YEAR YEAR AND A HALF BOTH ON LOOKING AT A NEW BUSINESS PLAN AND WHAT DOES EXPANSION LOOK LIKE
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@586.02:595.65 TEN DAYS AWAY FROM PROVING THAT THE PRODUCT THEY PRODUCED WAS AT THE WORLD QUALITY LEVEL NEEDED TO MAKE COARTEM WHEN THEY WERE IN THE BIGGEST CASH CRISIS OF THEIR HISTORY
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@596.26:605.84 AND WE CALLED ALL OF THE SOCIAL INVESTORS WE KNEW NOW SOME OF THESE SAME SOCIAL INVESTORS ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN AFRICA AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF AGRICULTURE
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@615.08:623.38 WE SOMETIMES HAVE THIS BIFURCATION BETWEEN BUSINESS AND THE SOCIAL AND IT'S REALLY TIME WE START THINKING MORE CREATIVELY ABOUT HOW THEY CAN BE
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@644.03:657.45 THIS IS SAMUEL HE 'S A FARMER HE WAS ACTUALLY LIVING IN THE KIBERA SLUMS WHEN HIS FATHER CALLED HIM AND TOLD HIM ABOUT ARTEMISIA AND THE VALUE ADD POTENTIAL SO HE MOVED BACK TO THE FARM AND LONG STORY SHORT THEY NOW HAVE SEVEN ACRES UNDER CULTIVATION
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@659.05:669.26 KIDS ARE IN PRIVATE SCHOOL AND HE 'S STARTING TO HELP OTHER FARMERS IN THE AREA ALSO GO INTO ARTEMISIA PRODUCTION DIGNITY BEING MORE IMPORTANT THAN WEALTH
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@670.13:683.69 THE NEXT ONE MANY OF YOU KNOW I TALKED ABOUT IT A LITTLE AT OXFORD TWO YEARS AGO AND SOME OF YOU VISITED A TO Z MANUFACTURING WHICH IS ONE OF THE GREAT REAL COMPANIES IN EAST AFRICA IT'S ANOTHER ONE THAT LIVES AT THE CONFLUENCE OF
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@684.52:695.42 HEALTH AND ENTERPRISE AND THIS IS REALLY A STORY ABOUT A PUBLIC PRIVATE SOLUTION THAT HAS REALLY WORKED IT STARTED IN JAPAN SUMITOMO HAD DEVELOPED A
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@706.98:717.39 LIKE ARTEMISIA IT HAD BEEN PRODUCED ONLY IN EAST ASIA AND AS PART OF ITS SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY SUMITOMO SAID WHY DON'T WE EXPERIMENT WITH WHETHER WE CAN PRODUCE IT IN AFRICA FOR AFRICANS
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@730.46:738.60 CAME IN WITH THE PATIENT CAPITAL AND WE ALSO HELPED TO IDENTIFY THE ENTREPRENEUR THAT WE WOULD ALL PARTNER WITH HERE IN AFRICA AND EXXON
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@747.82:757.85 IT'S A FORTY YEAR OLD COMPANY IT UNDERSTANDS MANUFACTURING IT'S GONE FROM SOCIALIST TANZANIA INTO CAPITALIST TANZANIA AND CONTINUED TO FLOURISH IT HAD ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES WHEN WE FIRST FOUND IT
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@758.34:767.23 AND SO ANUJ TOOK THE ENTREPRENEURIAL RISK HERE IN AFRICA TO PRODUCE A PUBLIC GOOD THAT WAS PURCHASED BY THE AID ESTABLISHMENT TO
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@767.58:776.97 WORK WITH MALARIA AND LONG STORY SHORT AGAIN THEY'VE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IN OUR FIRST YEAR THE FIRST NET WENT OFF THE LINE IN OCTOBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND THREE
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@777.55:789.73 WE THOUGHT THE HITTING IT OUT OF THE BOX NUMBER WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND NETS A YEAR THIS YEAR THEY ARE NOW PRODUCING EIGHT MILLION NETS A YEAR AND THEY EMPLOY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE NINETY PERCENT OF WHOM ARE WOMEN MOSTLY
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@791.30:799.51 IN A JOINT VENTURE WITH SUMITOMO AND SO FROM AN ENTERPRISE PERSPECTIVE FOR AFRICA AND FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE THESE ARE REAL SUCCESSES
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@807.95:820.69 AND IF AVIAN FLU HITS OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON THE WORLD DECIDES THAT MALARIA IS NO LONGER AS MUCH OF A PRIORITY EVERYBODY LOSES AND SO ANUJ AND ACUMEN HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@863.80:872.60 AND SO WE CAME IN WITH A SECOND ROUND OF PATIENT CAPITAL TO A TO Z A LOAN AS WELL AS A GRANT SO THAT A TO Z COULD PLAY WITH PRICING AND LISTEN TO THE MARKETPLACE
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@872.91:880.54 AND FOUND A NUMBER OF THINGS ONE THAT PEOPLE WILL PAY DIFFERENT PRICES BUT THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF PEOPLE WILL COME FORTH AT ONE DOLLAR PER NET
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@880.83:888.32 AND MAKE A DECISION TO BUY IT AND WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THEM THEY'LL ALSO HAVE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT WHAT THEY LIKE AND WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE AND THAT
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@888.81:901.17 SOME OF THE CHANNELS WE THOUGHT WOULD WORK DIDN'T WORK BUT BECAUSE OF THIS EXPERIMENTATION AND ITERATION THAT WAS ALLOWED BECAUSE OF THE PATIENT CAPITAL WE'VE NOW FOUND THAT IT COSTS ABOUT A DOLLAR IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO DISTRIBUTE AND A DOLLAR TO BUY THE NET
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@901.61:908.76 SO THEN FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE WHEN YOU START WITH THE MARKET WE HAVE A CHOICE WE CAN CONTINUE GOING ALONG AT TWELVE DOLLARS
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@921.80:928.38 THE PEOPLE THE DIGNITY OF CHOICE AND HAVE A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM THAT MIGHT OVER TIME START SUSTAINING ITSELF
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@938.59:947.16 WHENEVER I GO TO VISIT A TO Z I THINK OF MY GRANDMOTHER STELLA SHE
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@947.64:958.87 WAS VERY MUCH LIKE THOSE WOMEN SITTING BEHIND THE SEWING MACHINES SHE GREW UP ON A FARM IN AUSTRIA VERY POOR DIDN'T HAVE VERY MUCH EDUCATION SHE MOVED TO THE UNITED STATES WHERE SHE MET MY GRANDFATHER WHO WAS A CEMENT HAULER AND
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@960.47:970.03 THEY HAD NINE CHILDREN THREE OF THEM DIED AS BABIES MY GRANDMOTHER HAD TUBERCULOSIS AND SHE WORKED IN A SEWING MACHINE SHOP MAKING SHIRTS FOR ABOUT TEN CENTS AN HOUR
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@983.68:997.03 BUT BECAUSE SHE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE MARKETPLACE AND SHE LIVED IN A SOCIETY THAT PROVIDED THE SAFETY OF HAVING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH AND EDUCATION HER CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@997.83:1006.40 WERE ABLE TO LIVE LIVES OF REAL PURPOSE AND FOLLOW REAL DREAMS I LOOK AROUND AT MY SIBLINGS AND MY COUSINS AND AS I SAID THERE ARE A LOT OF US
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@1007.02:1015.99 AND I SEE TEACHERS AND MUSICIANS HEDGE FUND MANAGERS DESIGNERS ONE SISTER WHO MAKES OTHER PEOPLE 'S WISHES COME TRUE
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@1016.79:1026.25 AND MY WISH WHEN I SEE THOSE WOMEN I MEET THOSE FARMERS AND I THINK ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE ACROSS THIS CONTINENT WHO ARE WORKING HARD EVERY DAY
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@1026.66:1033.38 IS THAT THEY HAVE THAT SENSE OF OPPORTUNITY AND POSSIBILITY AND THAT THEY ALSO CAN
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@1034.56:1045.93 AND GET ACCESS TO SERVICES SO THAT THEIR CHILDREN TOO CAN LIVE THOSE LIVES OF GREAT PURPOSE IT SHOULDN 'T BE THAT DIFFICULT BUT WHAT IT TAKES IS A COMMITMENT FROM ALL OF US TO
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@1059.61:1070.65 IT TAKES OPENING YOUR ARMS BOTH WIDE AND EXPECTING VERY LITTLE LOVE IN RETURN BUT DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY AND BRINGING THE ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE TABLE AS WELL
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G@1071.25:1079.05 AND MOST OF ALL MOST OF ALL IT REQUIRES THAT ALL OF US HAVE THE COURAGE AND THE PATIENCE WHETHER WE ARE RICH OR POOR
