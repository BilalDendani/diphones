PhilippeStarck_2007 TOOTHPICK BEAUTIFUL TOILET SEATS
PhilippeStarck_2007 ONE WE CAN CALL IT THE CYNICAL DESIGN THAT MEANS THE DESIGN INVENTED BY RAYMOND LOEWY IN THE FIFTIES WHO SAID WHAT
PhilippeStarck_2007 WHICH IS TERRIBLE IT MEANS THE DESIGN MUST BE JUST THE WEAPON FOR MARKETING FOR PRODUCER TO MAKE PRODUCT
PhilippeStarck_2007 THAT THE CYNICAL DESIGN AFTER THERE IS
PhilippeStarck_2007 DESIGN IT'S
PhilippeStarck_2007 THERE IS PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO TRY TO DESERVE TO EXIST AND WHO ARE SO
PhilippeStarck_2007 TO MAKE THIS USELESS JOB WHO TRY TO DO IT IN ANOTHER WAY AND THEY TRY I TRY TO
PhilippeStarck_2007 MAKE THE OBJECT FOR THE OBJECT BUT FOR THE RESULT FOR THE PROFIT FOR THE HUMAN BEING THE PERSON WHO WILL USE IT IF WE TAKE THE TOOTHBRUSH I DON'T THINK ABOUT THE TOOTHBRUSH I THINK WHAT
PhilippeStarck_2007 IN WHAT SOCIETY THIS GUY LIVE WHAT CIVILIZATION CREATES THIS SOCIETY
PhilippeStarck_2007 WHAT ANIMAL SPECIES CREATES THIS CIVILIZATION WHEN I
PhilippeStarck_2007 ANYTHING BUT WHEN I COME BACK I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY I SHALL NOT DO IT BECAUSE TODAY TO NOT
PhilippeStarck_2007 BUT TO COME BACK WHERE I AM AT THE ANIMAL SPECIES
PhilippeStarck_2007 THERE IS THINGS TO SEE THERE IS THINGS TO SEE THERE IS THE BIG CHALLENGE THE BIG CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF US
PhilippeStarck_2007 BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A HUMAN PRODUCTION WHICH EXISTS
PhilippeStarck_2007 OF WHAT I CALL THE BIG IMAGE THE
PhilippeStarck_2007 MUTATION OUR LIFE WE MUST REMEMBER AND WE CAN SEE THAT
PhilippeStarck_2007 YES
PhilippeStarck_2007 THERE WAS THIS SOUP CALLED SOUPE PRIMORDIALE THIS FIRST SOUP BLOOP BLOOP
PhilippeStarck_2007 SORT OF DIRTY MUD NO LIFE NOTHING
PhilippeStarck_2007 AND THAT
PhilippeStarck_2007 UP AT THE END FINALLY THAT SUCCEEDS AND LIFE APPEARS WE WAS SO
PhilippeStarck_2007 SO STUPID THE MOST STUPID BACTERIA EVEN I THINK WE COPY OUR WAY TO REPRODUCE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN AND SOMETHING OF
PhilippeStarck_2007 AFTER WE BECOME A FISH AFTER WE BECOME A FROG AFTER WE BECOME A MONKEY AFTER WE BECOME WHAT WE ARE TODAY A SUPER MONKEY
PhilippeStarck_2007 AND THE FUN IS THE SUPER MONKEY WE ARE TODAY IS AT HALF OF THE STORY
PhilippeStarck_2007 CAN YOU IMAGINE FROM THAT STUPID BACTERIA TO US WITH A MICROPHONE WITH A COMPUTER WITH AN IPOD FOUR BILLION YEARS
PhilippeStarck_2007 AND WE KNOW AND ESPECIALLY CAROLYN THAT
PhilippeStarck_2007 DON'T KNOW WHAT AND
PhilippeStarck_2007 FOUR BILLION YEARS
PhilippeStarck_2007 YES SHE SAID SOMETHING LIKE THAT OK THAT MEANS WE ARE
PhilippeStarck_2007 CAN YOU IMAGINE IT'S VERY SYMBOLIC BECAUSE THE BACTERIA WE WAS HAD NO IDEA OF WHAT WE ARE TODAY
PhilippeStarck_2007 AND TODAY WE HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT WE SHALL BE IN FOUR BILLION YEARS AND THIS TERRITORY IS
PhilippeStarck_2007 THAT IS OUR POETRY THAT IS OUR BEAUTIFUL STORY IT'S OUR
PhilippeStarck_2007 WE ARE MUTANTS AND IF WE DON'T DEEPLY UNDERSTAND IF WE DON'T INTEGRATE THAT WE ARE MUTANTS WE COMPLETELY MISS THE STORY
PhilippeStarck_2007 EVERY GENERATION THINKS WE ARE THE FINAL ONE WE HAVE A WAY TO LOOK AT EARTH LIKE THAT YOU KNOW I AM THE MAN
PhilippeStarck_2007 WE MUTATE DURING FOUR BILLION YEARS BEFORE BUT NOW BECAUSE IT'S ME WE STOP
PhilippeStarck_2007 JACKET SOMETHING LIKE THAT
PhilippeStarck_2007 I AM NOT SURE OF THAT
PhilippeStarck_2007 BECAUSE THAT IS OUR INTELLIGENCE OF MUTATION AND THINGS LIKE THAT THERE IS SO MANY THINGS TO DO IT'S SO FRESH
PhilippeStarck_2007 AND HERE IS SOMETHING NOBODY IS OBLIGED TO BE A GENIUS
PhilippeStarck_2007 BUT EVERYBODY IS OBLIGED TO PARTICIPATE AND TO PARTICIPATE FOR A MUTANT THERE IS A MINIMUM OF
PhilippeStarck_2007 MINIMUM OF SPORT WE CAN SAY THAT THE FIRST IF YOU WANT THERE IS SO MANY BUT ONE WHICH IS VERY EASY TO DO IS THE DUTY OF VISION
PhilippeStarck_2007 I CAN EXPLAIN YOU I SHALL TRY
PhilippeStarck_2007 YOU WALK
PhilippeStarck_2007 BUT PERHAPS BECAUSE YOU WALK WITH THE EYES LIKE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEE OH THERE IS A HOLE AND YOU WILL FALL AND YOU WILL DIE DANGEROUS THAT'S WHY PERHAPS YOU WILL TRY
PhilippeStarck_2007 I CAN SEE
PhilippeStarck_2007 AND THEY CONTINUE UP UP UP I RAISE THE ANGLE OF VISION
PhilippeStarck_2007 BUT IT'S STILL VERY SELFISH SELFISH EGOISTE YES SELFISH YOU YOU SURVIVE IT'S OK
PhilippeStarck_2007 IF YOU RAISE THE LEVEL OF YOUR EYES A LITTLE MORE YOU GO I SEE YOU OH MY GOD YOU ARE HERE HOW ARE YOU I CAN
PhilippeStarck_2007 I CAN DESIGN FOR YOU A NEW TOOTHBRUSH NEW TOILET BRUSH SOMETHING LIKE THAT I LIVE IN SOCIETY I LIVE IN COMMUNITY IT'S OK
PhilippeStarck_2007 TO BE IN THE TERRITORY OF INTELLIGENCE WE CAN SAY FROM THIS LEVEL
PhilippeStarck_2007 MORE YOU WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR THE SOCIETY THE MORE YOU WILL RISE THE MORE YOU WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR THE CIVILIZATION THE MORE YOU WILL RISE
PhilippeStarck_2007 TO SEE FAR AND HIGH LIKE THAT THE MORE YOU WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR THE STORY OF OUR MUTATION THAT MEANS INTELLIGENT PEOPLE ARE IN THIS ANGLE THAT
PhilippeStarck_2007 FROM THIS TO HERE THAT
PhilippeStarck_2007 EINSTEIN THINGS LIKE THAT NOBODY 'S OBLIGED TO BE A GENIUS IT'S BETTER BUT NOBODY
PhilippeStarck_2007 TAKE CARE IN THIS TRAINING TO BE A GOOD MUTANT
PhilippeStarck_2007 TRAP ONE TRAP THE VERTICAL BECAUSE AT THE VERTICAL OF US IF YOU LOOK LIKE THAT
PhilippeStarck_2007 WHEN WE DON'T KNOW
PhilippeStarck_2007 WHEN YOUR BRAIN IS NOT ENOUGH BIG WHEN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU GO AH IT'S GOD IT'S GOD THAT'S RIDICULOUS THAT'S WHY JUMP
PhilippeStarck_2007 COME BACK BECAUSE AFTER THERE IS ANOTHER TRAP IF YOU LOOK LIKE THAT YOU LOOK
PhilippeStarck_2007 OR YOU LOOK INSIDE IF YOU ARE VERY FLEXIBLE INSIDE YOURSELF IT'S CALLED SCHIZOPHRENIA AND YOU
PhilippeStarck_2007 THAT'S WHY EVERY MORNING NOW BECAUSE YOU ARE A GOOD MUTANT YOU WILL RAISE YOUR ANGLE OF VIEW OUT MORE OF THE HORIZONTAL YOU
PhilippeStarck_2007 NEVER FORGET LIKE THAT LIKE THAT
PhilippeStarck_2007 IT'S VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT WHAT
PhilippeStarck_2007 WHAT ELSE WE CAN SAY ABOUT THAT WHY DO THAT IT'S BECAUSE WE
PhilippeStarck_2007 WE LOOK FROM FAR WE SEE
PhilippeStarck_2007 OF EVOLUTION THIS LINE OF EVOLUTION IS CLEARLY POSITIVE FROM FAR THIS LINE LOOKS VERY SMOOTH LIKE THAT BUT IF YOU TAKE A LENS
PhilippeStarck_2007 THAT THIS LINE IS ACK ACK ACK ACK ACK LIKE THAT IT'S MADE OF LIGHT
PhilippeStarck_2007 AND SHADOW WE CAN SAY LIGHT IS CIVILIZATION SHADOW IS BARBARIA AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHERE WE ARE
PhilippeStarck_2007 BECAUSE SOME CYCLE THERE IS A SPOT IN THE CYCLE AND YOU HAVE NOT THE SAME DUTY IN THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CYCLE THAT MEANS
PhilippeStarck_2007 WE CAN IMAGINE I DON'T SAY IT WAS FANTASTIC BUT IN THE EIGHTIES THERE WAS NOT TOO MUCH
PhilippeStarck_2007 LIKE THAT IT WAS WE CAN IMAGINE THAT THE CIVILIZATION CAN BECOME
PhilippeStarck_2007 IN THIS CASE PEOPLE LIKE ME ARE ACCEPTABLE WE CAN SAY IT 'S LUXURIOUS TIME WE HAVE TIME TO THINK WE HAVE TIME TO
PhilippeStarck_2007 SO FAST SO FAST TO SHADOW WE FALL SO FAST TO BARBARIA
PhilippeStarck_2007 MANY MANY MANY MANY FACE OF BARBARIA BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE BARBARIA WE HAVE TODAY IT'S
PhilippeStarck_2007 WE THINK THERE IS DIFFERENT TYPE OF BARBARIA THAT'S WHY WE MUST ADAPT THAT MEANS
PhilippeStarck_2007 WHEN BARBARIA IS BACK FORGET THE BEAUTIFUL CHAIRS FORGET THE BEAUTIFUL
PhilippeStarck_2007 FORGET DESIGN EVEN I'M SORRY TO SAY FORGET ART FORGET ALL THAT THERE IS PRIORITY THERE IS
PhilippeStarck_2007 YOU MUST GO BACK TO POLITICS YOU MUST GO BACK TO RADICALIZATION I'M SORRY IF THAT'S NOT VERY ENGLISH YOU MUST GO BACK TO FIGHT TO BATTLE THAT'S WHY TODAY I'M SO ASHAMED TO MAKE THIS JOB THAT'S WHY
PhilippeStarck_2007 TO TRY TO DO IT THE BEST POSSIBLE BUT I KNOW THAT EVEN I DO IT THE BEST POSSIBLE THAT'S WHY I'M THE BEST IT'S NOTHING BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME THAT'S WHY I SAY THAT I SAY THAT
PhilippeStarck_2007 THIS SCENARIO OF THIS CIVILIZATION WAS ABOUT BECOMING POWERFUL INTELLIGENT LIKE THIS IDEA WE HAVE INVENTED THIS CONCEPT OF GOD WE ARE GOD NOW
PhilippeStarck_2007 WE ARE IT'S ALMOST DONE WE HAVE JUST TO FINISH THE STORY THAT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND WHEN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
PhilippeStarck_2007 REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENED YOU CANNOT GO AND FIGHT AND WORK AND BUILD AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU GO TO THE FUTURE
PhilippeStarck_2007 BACK BACK BACK BACK LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN FALL AND IT'S VERY DANGEROUS NO YOU
PhilippeStarck_2007 BECAUSE WE HAVE ALMOST FINISHED I'LL REPEAT THIS STORY AND THE BEAUTY OF THIS IN PERHAPS FIFTY YEARS SIXTY YEARS WE CAN FINISH COMPLETELY THIS CIVILIZATION AND
PhilippeStarck_2007 TO OUR CHILDREN THE POSSIBILITY TO INVENT A NEW STORY A NEW POETRY A NEW
PhilippeStarck_2007 PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN BORN WORKED LIVED AND DIED BEFORE US THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED SO MUCH
PhilippeStarck_2007 WE HAVE NOW BRING BEAUTIFUL THINGS BEAUTIFUL GIFTS WE KNOW SO MANY THINGS WE CAN SAY TO OUR CHILDREN OK
PhilippeStarck_2007 DONE THAT WAS OUR STORY THAT PASSED NOW YOU HAVE A DUTY INVENT A NEW STORY
PhilippeStarck_2007 A NEW POETRY THE ONLY RULE IS WE HAVE NOT TO HAVE ANY IDEA ABOUT THE NEXT STORY
