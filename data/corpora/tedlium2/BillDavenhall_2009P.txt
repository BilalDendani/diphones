BillDavenhall_2009P@22.36:25.45 IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE I GOT HIT BY A TRAIN
BillDavenhall_2009P@26.39:28.42 MY TRAIN WAS A HEART ATTACK
BillDavenhall_2009P@29.42:33.07 I FOUND MYSELF IN A HOSPITAL IN AN INTENSIVE CARE WARD
BillDavenhall_2009P@33.81:40.42 RECUPERATING FROM EMERGENCY SURGERY AND I SUDDENLY REALIZED SOMETHING THAT I WAS COMPLETELY IN THE DARK
BillDavenhall_2009P@41.44:56.01 I STARTED ASKING MY QUESTIONS WELL WHY ME WHY NOW WHY HERE COULD MY DOCTOR HAVE WARNED ME SO WHAT I WANT TO DO HERE IN THE FEW MINUTES I HAVE WITH YOU IS REALLY TALK ABOUT WHAT IS THE FORMULA FOR LIFE AND GOOD HEALTH
BillDavenhall_2009P@67.12:77.34 WELL I UNDERSTAND THE GENETICS AND LIFESTYLE PART AND YOU KNOW WHY I UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE MY PHYSICIANS CONSTANTLY ASK ME QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS
BillDavenhall_2009P@77.73:85.43 YOU EVER HAD TO FILL OUT THOSE LONG LEGAL SIZE FORMS IN YOUR DOCTOR 'S OFFICE I MEAN IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH YOU GET TO DO IT MORE THAN ONCE RIGHT
BillDavenhall_2009P@86.17:99.01 DO IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THEY ASK YOU QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR LIFESTYLE AND YOUR FAMILY HISTORY YOUR MEDICATION HISTORY YOUR SURGICAL HISTORY YOUR ALLERGY HISTORY DID I FORGET ANY HISTORY
BillDavenhall_2009P@100.11:102.18 BUT THIS PART OF THE EQUATION
BillDavenhall_2009P@102.62:114.06 I DIDN'T REALLY GET AND I DON'T THINK MY PHYSICIANS REALLY GET THIS PART OF THE EQUATION WHAT DOES THAT MEAN MY ENVIRONMENT WELL IT CAN MEAN A LOT OF THINGS THIS IS MY LIFE
BillDavenhall_2009P@114.96:118.13 THESE ARE MY LIFE PLACES WE ALL HAVE THESE
BillDavenhall_2009P@118.88:123.32 WHILE I'M TALKING I'D LIKE YOU TO ALSO BE THINKING ABOUT HOW MANY PLACES HAVE YOU LIVED
BillDavenhall_2009P@124.29:132.16 JUST THINK ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW WANDER THROUGH YOUR LIFE THINKING ABOUT THIS AND YOU REALIZE THAT YOU SPEND IT IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PLACES
BillDavenhall_2009P@132.54:141.06 YOU SPEND IT AT REST AND YOU SPEND IT AT WORK AND IF YOU'RE LIKE ME YOU'RE IN AN AIRPLANE A GOOD PORTION OF YOUR TIME TRAVELING SOME PLACE SO IT'S NOT REALLY SIMPLE
BillDavenhall_2009P@141.24:150.55 WHEN SOMEBODY ASKS YOU WHERE DO YOU LIVE WHERE DO YOU WORK AND WHERE DO YOU SPEND ALL YOUR TIME AND WHERE DO YOU EXPOSE YOURSELVES TO RISKS THAT MAYBE PERHAPS YOU DON'T EVEN SEE
BillDavenhall_2009P@152.62:159.89 WELL WHEN I HAVE DONE THIS ON MYSELF I ALWAYS COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT I SPEND ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF MY TIME
BillDavenhall_2009P@163.15:170.97 AND I DON'T WANDER FAR FROM THAT PLACE FOR A MAJORITY OF MY TIME EVEN THOUGH I'M AN EXTENSIVE GLOBAL TREKKER
BillDavenhall_2009P@180.04:190.81 BUT THIS IS WHERE I SPENT MY FIRST NINETEEN YEARS WITH MY LITTLE YOUNG LUNGS YOU KNOW BREATHING HIGH CONCENTRATIONS HERE OF SULFUR DIOXIDE CARBON DIOXIDE AND METHANE GAS
BillDavenhall_2009P@191.25:200.66 IN UNEQUAL QUANTITIES NINETEEN YEARS OF THIS AND IF YOU'VE BEEN IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY THIS IS WHAT THOSE PILES OF BURNING SMOLDERING COAL WASTE LOOK LIKE
BillDavenhall_2009P@200.99:211.95 SO THEN I DECIDED TO LEAVE THAT PART OF THE WORLD AND I WAS GOING TO GO TO THE MID WEST OKAY SO I ENDED UP IN LOUISVILLE KENTUCKY WELL I DECIDED TO BE NEIGHBORS TO A PLACE CALLED
BillDavenhall_2009P@213.34:222.53 THEY MANUFACTURE PLASTICS THEY USE LARGE QUANTITIES CHLOROPRENE AND BENZENE OKAY I SPENT TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN MY MIDDLE AGE LUNGS NOW
BillDavenhall_2009P@230.16:238.16 IT IT WAS INSIDIOUS AND IT WAS REALLY HAPPENING AND THEN I DECIDED I HAD TO GET REALLY SMART I WOULD TAKE THIS JOB IN THE WEST COAST
BillDavenhall_2009P@238.89:253.00 AND I MOVED TO REDLANDS CALIFORNIA VERY NICE AND THERE MY OLDER SENIOR LUNGS AS I LIKE TO CALL THEM I FILLED WITH PARTICULATE MATTER CARBON DIOXIDE AND VERY HIGH DOES OF OZONE
BillDavenhall_2009P@263.59:271.82 WELL THE PICTURE IS THERE IS A HUGE GAP HERE THE ONE THING THAT NEVER HAPPENS IN MY DOCTOR 'S OFFICE THEY NEVER ASK ME ABOUT MY PLACE HISTORY
BillDavenhall_2009P@272.86:275.17 DOCTOR CAN I REMEMBER EVER ASKING ME
BillDavenhall_2009P@278.14:281.81 ASKED ME WHAT KIND OF THE QUALITY OF THE DRINKING WATER THAT I PUT IN MY MOUTH
BillDavenhall_2009P@282.50:284.60 OR THE FOOD THAT I INGEST INTO MY STOMACH
BillDavenhall_2009P@285.30:287.35 THEY REALLY DON'T DO THAT IT'S MISSING
BillDavenhall_2009P@288.27:290.26 LOOK AT THE KIND OF DATA THAT IS AVAILABLE
BillDavenhall_2009P@308.62:314.30 SO HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN THE WHITE HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THE ROOM HAVE SPENT THE MAJORITY OF THEIR LIFE IN THE WHITE SPACE
BillDavenhall_2009P@315.26:319.69 ANYBODY BOY YOU'RE LUCKY HOW MANY HAVE SPENT IT IN THE RED PLACES
BillDavenhall_2009P@321.17:322.12 NOT SO LUCKY
BillDavenhall_2009P@330.31:333.25 SOME SENSE OF WHAT'S GOING TO BE OUR TRAIN WRECK
BillDavenhall_2009P@334.24:338.80 BUT NONE OF THAT IS IN MY MEDICAL RECORD AND IT'S NOT IN YOURS EITHER
BillDavenhall_2009P@338.96:341.63 SO HERE IS MY FRIEND PAUL HE 'S A COLLEAGUE
BillDavenhall_2009P@342.04:351.85 HE ALLOWED HIS CELL PHONE TO BE TRACKED EVERY TWO HOURS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS OUT OF THE YEAR FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS EVERYWHERE HE
BillDavenhall_2009P@352.43:359.29 AND YOU CAN SEE HE 'S BEEN TO A FEW PLACES AROUND THE UNITED STATES AND THIS IS WHERE HE HAS SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME
BillDavenhall_2009P@360.46:372.52 IF YOU REALLY STUDIED THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME CLUES AS TO WHAT PAUL LIKES TO DO ANYBODY GOT ANY CLUES SKIING RIGHT WE CAN ZOOM IN HERE AND WE SUDDENLY SEE
BillDavenhall_2009P@373.08:383.49 NOW WE SEE WHERE PAUL HAS REALLY SPENT A MAJORITY OF HIS TIME AND ALL OF THOSE BLACK DOTS ARE ALL OF THE TOXIC RELEASE INVENTORIES THAT ARE MONITORED BY THE
BillDavenhall_2009P@384.80:386.48 DID YOU KNOW THAT DATA EXISTED
BillDavenhall_2009P@387.18:392.24 FOR EVERY COMMUNITY IN THE UNITED STATES YOU COULD HAVE YOUR OWN PERSONALIZED MAP OF THAT
BillDavenhall_2009P@393.38:407.59 OUR CELLPHONES CAN NOW BUILD A PLACE HISTORY THIS IS HOW PAUL DID IT HE DID IT WITH HIS IPHONE THIS MIGHT BE WHAT WE END UP WITH THIS IS WHAT THE PHYSICIAN WOULD HAVE IN FRONT OF HIM AND HER WHEN WE ENTER THAT EXAM ROOM
BillDavenhall_2009P@417.36:430.21 I SUGGEST THAT MAYBE YOU NOT DECIDE JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE OUT HERE IN BEAUTIFUL CALIFORNIA AND IT'S WARM EVERY DAY THAT YOU GET OUT AND RUN AT SIX O'CLOCK AT NIGHT I'D SUGGEST THAT THAT'S A BAD IDEA BILL
BillDavenhall_2009P@431.11:432.57 BECAUSE OF THIS REPORT
BillDavenhall_2009P@434.79:449.34 WHAT I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU FOR ARE TWO PRESCRIPTIONS OKAY NUMBER ONE IS WE MUST TEACH PHYSICIANS ABOUT THE VALUE OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION IT'S CALLED GEOMEDICINE THERE ARE ABOUT A HALF A DOZEN PROGRAMS IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW THAT ARE FOCUSED ON THIS
BillDavenhall_2009P@449.92:452.33 AND THEY'RE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT
BillDavenhall_2009P@452.89:454.86 THESE PROGRAMS NEED TO BE SUPPORTED
BillDavenhall_2009P@455.45:463.27 AND WE NEED TO TEACH OUR FUTURE DOCTORS OF THE WORLD THE IMPORTANCE OF SOME OF THE INFORMATION I'VE SHARED HERE WITH YOU TODAY
BillDavenhall_2009P@463.73:476.74 THE SECOND THING WE NEED TO DO IS WHILE WE'RE SPENDING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ALL OVER THE WORLD BUILDING AN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD WE MAKE SURE WE PUT A PLACE HISTORY INSIDE THAT MEDICAL RECORD
BillDavenhall_2009P@486.70:488.35 WILL ALSO BE USEFUL FOR US
BillDavenhall_2009P@508.26:513.09 WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SAY THAT JACK LORD SAID THIS ALMOST TEN YEARS AGO
BillDavenhall_2009P@514.19:515.44 JUST LOOK AT THAT FOR A MINUTE
BillDavenhall_2009P@516.92:524.63 THAT WAS WHAT THE CONCLUSION OF THE DARTMOUTH ATLAS OF HEALTHCARE WAS ABOUT WITH SAYING THAT WE CAN EXPLAIN THE GEOGRAPHIC VARIATIONS
BillDavenhall_2009P@524.90:534.97 THAT OCCUR IN DISEASE IN ILLNESS IN WELLNESS AND HOW OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ACTUALLY OPERATES THAT WAS WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT ON THAT QUOTE
BillDavenhall_2009P@535.37:545.93 AND I WOULD SAY HE GOT IT RIGHT ALMOST A DECADE AGO SO I'D VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE US BEGIN TO REALLY SEIZE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET THIS INTO OUR MEDICAL RECORDS
BillDavenhall_2009P@546.51:557.85 SO WITH THAT I'LL LEAVE YOU THAT IN MY PARTICULAR VIEW OF VIEW OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHY ALWAYS MATTERS AND I BELIEVE THAT GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION CAN MAKE BOTH YOU AND ME VERY HEALTHY THANK YOU
