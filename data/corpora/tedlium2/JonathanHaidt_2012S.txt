JonathanHaidt_2012S@21.36:28.32 NOW I DON 'T MEAN ACTUAL ASTEROIDS MADE OF ROCK AND METAL THAT ACTUALLY WOULDN 'T BE SUCH A PROBLEM BECAUSE IF WE WERE REALLY ALL GOING TO DIE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@28.32:42.39 WE WOULD PUT ASIDE OUR DIFFERENCES WE 'D SPEND WHATEVER IT TOOK AND WE 'D FIND A WAY TO DEFLECT THEM I 'M TALKING INSTEAD ABOUT THREATS THAT ARE HEADED OUR WAY BUT THEY 'RE WRAPPED IN A SPECIAL ENERGY FIELD THAT POLARIZES US AND THEREFORE PARALYZES US
JonathanHaidt_2012S@42.39:62.07 LAST MARCH I WENT TO THE TED CONFERENCE AND I SAW JIM HANSEN SPEAK THE NASA SCIENTIST WHO FIRST RAISED THE ALARM ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING IN THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY S AND IT SEEMS THAT THE PREDICTIONS HE MADE BACK THEN ARE COMING TRUE THIS IS WHERE WE 'RE HEADED IN TERMS OF GLOBAL TEMPERATURE RISES AND IF WE KEEP ON GOING THE WAY WE 'RE GOING WE GET A FOUR OR FIVE DEGREE CENTIGRADE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@62.07:64.31 TEMPERATURE RISE BY THE END OF THIS CENTURY
JonathanHaidt_2012S@64.31:71.22 HANSEN SAYS WE CAN EXPECT ABOUT A FIVE METER RISE IN SEA LEVELS THIS IS WHAT A FIVE METER RISE IN SEA LEVELS WOULD LOOK LIKE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@71.22:86.8 LOW LYING CITIES ALL AROUND THE WORLD WILL DISAPPEAR WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF CHILDREN BORN TODAY HANSEN CLOSED HIS TALK BY SAYING IMAGINE A GIANT ASTEROID ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH EARTH THAT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF WHAT WE FACE NOW
JonathanHaidt_2012S@86.8:95.17 YET WE DITHER TAKING NO ACTION TO DEFLECT THE ASTEROID EVEN THOUGH THE LONGER WE WAIT THE MORE DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE IT BECOMES
JonathanHaidt_2012S@95.17:100.16 OF COURSE THE LEFT WANTS TO TAKE ACTION BUT THE RIGHT DENIES THAT THERE 'S ANY PROBLEM
JonathanHaidt_2012S@100.16:117.3 ALL RIGHT SO I GO BACK FROM TED AND THEN THE FOLLOWING WEEK I 'M INVITED TO A DINNER PARTY IN WASHINGTON D C WHERE I KNOW THAT I 'LL BE MEETING A NUMBER OF CONSERVATIVE INTELLECTUALS INCLUDING YUVAL LEVIN AND TO PREPARE FOR THE MEETING I READ THIS ARTICLE BY LEVIN IN NATIONAL AFFAIRS CALLED BEYOND THE WELFARE STATE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@117.3:128.61 LEVIN WRITES THAT ALL OVER THE WORLD NATIONS ARE COMING TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC WELFARE STATE IS TURNING OUT TO BE UNTENABLE AND UNAFFORDABLE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@128.61:137.82 DEPENDENT UPON DUBIOUS ECONOMICS AND THE DEMOGRAPHIC MODEL OF A BYGONE ERA ALL RIGHT NOW THIS MIGHT NOT SOUND AS SCARY AS AN ASTEROID
JonathanHaidt_2012S@137.82:154.95 BUT LOOK AT THESE GRAPHS THAT LEVIN SHOWED THIS GRAPH SHOWS THE NATIONAL DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF AMERICA 'S GDP AND AS YOU SEE IF YOU GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE FOUNDING WE BORROWED A LOT OF MONEY TO FIGHT THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR WARS ARE EXPENSIVE BUT THEN WE 'D PAY IT OFF PAY IT OFF PAY IT OFF AND THEN OH WHAT 'S THIS THE CIVIL WAR
JonathanHaidt_2012S@154.95:170.06 EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE BORROW A LOT OF MONEY PAY IT OFF PAY IT OFF PAY IT OFF GET DOWN TO NEAR ZERO AND BANG WORLD WAR I ONCE AGAIN THE SAME PROCESS REPEATS NOW THEN WE GET THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND WORLD WAR II WE RISE TO AN ASTRONOMICAL LEVEL AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN PERCENT OF GDP
JonathanHaidt_2012S@170.06:177.9 REALLY UNSUSTAINABLE REALLY DANGEROUS BUT WE PAY IT OFF PAY IT OFF PAY IT OFF AND THEN WHAT 'S THIS
JonathanHaidt_2012S@177.9:188.11 WHY HAS IT BEEN RISING SINCE THE SEVENTY S IT 'S PARTLY DUE TO TAX CUTS THAT WERE UNFUNDED BUT IT 'S DUE PRIMARILY TO THE RISE OF ENTITLEMENT SPENDING ESPECIALLY MEDICARE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@188.11:206.7 WE 'RE APPROACHING THE LEVELS OF INDEBTEDNESS WE HAD AT WORLD WAR II AND THE BABY BOOMERS HAVEN 'T EVEN RETIRED YET AND WHEN THEY DO THIS IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN THIS IS DATA FROM THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE SHOWING ITS MOST REALISTIC FORECAST OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF CURRENT SITUATIONS AND EXPECTATIONS AND TRENDS ARE EXTENDED
JonathanHaidt_2012S@206.7:212.27 ALL RIGHT NOW WHAT YOU MIGHT NOTICE IS THAT THESE TWO GRAPHS ARE ACTUALLY IDENTICAL
JonathanHaidt_2012S@212.27:221.94 NOT IN TERMS OF THE X AND Y AXES OR IN TERMS OF THE DATA THEY PRESENT BUT IN TERMS OF THEIR MORAL AND POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS THEY SAY THE SAME THING LET ME TRANSLATE FOR YOU
JonathanHaidt_2012S@221.94:224.41 WE ARE DOOMED UNLESS WE START
JonathanHaidt_2012S@232.46:249.2 WE CAN DEFLECT BOTH OF THESE ASTEROIDS THESE PROBLEMS ARE BOTH TECHNICALLY SOLVABLE OUR PROBLEM AND OUR TRAGEDY IS THAT IN THESE HYPER PARTISAN TIMES THE MERE FACT THAT ONE SIDE SAYS LOOK THERE 'S AN ASTEROID MEANS THAT THE OTHER SIDE 'S GOING TO SAY HUH WHAT NO I 'M NOT EVEN GOING TO LOOK UP
JonathanHaidt_2012S@249.2:256.14 TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS HAPPENING TO US AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT WE NEED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT MORAL PSYCHOLOGY
JonathanHaidt_2012S@256.14:275.93 SO I 'M A SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGIST AND I STUDY MORALITY AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES OF MORALITY IS THAT MORALITY BINDS AND BLINDS IT BINDS US INTO TEAMS THAT CIRCLE AROUND SACRED VALUES BUT THEREBY MAKES US GO BLIND TO OBJECTIVE REALITY THINK OF IT LIKE THIS LARGE SCALE COOPERATION IS EXTREMELY RARE ON THIS PLANET
JonathanHaidt_2012S@275.93:284.59 THERE ARE ONLY A FEW SPECIES THAT CAN DO IT THAT 'S A BEEHIVE THAT 'S A TERMITE MOUND A GIANT TERMITE MOUND AND WHEN YOU FIND THIS IN OTHER ANIMALS IT 'S ALWAYS THE SAME STORY
JonathanHaidt_2012S@287.11:293.84 WHO ARE CHILDREN OF A SINGLE QUEEN SO THEY 'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT THEY RISE OR FALL THEY LIVE OR DIE AS ONE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@293.84:309.11 THERE 'S ONLY ONE SPECIES ON THE PLANET THAT CAN DO THIS WITHOUT KINSHIP AND THAT OF COURSE IS US THIS IS A RECONSTRUCTION OF ANCIENT BABYLON AND THIS IS TENOCHTITLAN NOW HOW DID WE DO THIS HOW DID WE GO FROM BEING HUNTER GATHERERS TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO
JonathanHaidt_2012S@309.11:316.31 TO BUILDING THESE GIGANTIC CITIES IN JUST A FEW THOUSAND YEARS IT 'S MIRACULOUS AND PART OF THE EXPLANATION
JonathanHaidt_2012S@316.31:335.06 IS THIS ABILITY TO CIRCLE AROUND SACRED VALUES AS YOU SEE TEMPLES AND GODS PLAY A BIG ROLE IN ALL ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS THIS IS AN IMAGE OF MUSLIMS CIRCLING THE KAABA IN MECCA IT 'S A SACRED ROCK AND WHEN PEOPLE CIRCLE SOMETHING TOGETHER THEY UNITE THEY CAN TRUST EACH OTHER THEY BECOME ONE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@335.06:350.38 IT 'S AS THOUGH YOU 'RE MOVING AN ELECTRICAL WIRE THROUGH A MAGNETIC FIELD THAT GENERATES CURRENT WHEN PEOPLE CIRCLE TOGETHER THEY GENERATE A CURRENT WE LOVE TO CIRCLE AROUND THINGS WE CIRCLE AROUND FLAGS AND THEN WE CAN TRUST EACH OTHER WE CAN FIGHT AS A TEAM AS A UNIT
JonathanHaidt_2012S@350.38:355.01 BUT EVEN AS MORALITY BINDS PEOPLE TOGETHER INTO A UNIT INTO A TEAM
JonathanHaidt_2012S@355.01:371.74 THE CIRCLING BLINDS THEM IT CAUSES THEM TO DISTORT REALITY WE BEGIN SEPARATING EVERYTHING INTO GOOD VERSUS EVIL NOW THAT PROCESS FEELS GREAT IT FEELS REALLY SATISFYING BUT IT IS A GROSS DISTORTION OF REALITY
JonathanHaidt_2012S@371.74:390.75 YOU CAN SEE THE MORAL ELECTROMAGNET OPERATING IN THE U S CONGRESS THIS IS A GRAPH THAT SHOWS THE DEGREE TO WHICH VOTING IN CONGRESS FALLS STRICTLY ALONG THE LEFT RIGHT AXIS SO THAT IF YOU KNOW HOW LIBERAL OR CONSERVATIVE SOMEONE IS YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW THEY VOTED ON ALL THE MAJOR ISSUES AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT IN THE DECADES AFTER THE CIVIL WAR
JonathanHaidt_2012S@390.99:409.22 CONGRESS WAS EXTRAORDINARILY POLARIZED AS YOU WOULD EXPECT ABOUT AS HIGH AS CAN BE BUT THEN AFTER WORLD WAR I THINGS DROPPED AND WE GET THIS HISTORICALLY LOW LEVEL OF POLARIZATION THIS WAS A GOLDEN AGE OF BIPARTISANSHIP AT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE PARTIES ABILITY TO WORK TOGETHER AND SOLVE GRAND NATIONAL PROBLEMS
JonathanHaidt_2012S@409.22:416.71 BUT IN THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY S AND NINETY S THE ELECTROMAGNET TURNS BACK ON POLARIZATION RISES
JonathanHaidt_2012S@416.71:436.36 IT USED TO BE THAT CONSERVATIVES AND MODERATES AND LIBERALS COULD ALL WORK TOGETHER IN CONGRESS THEY COULD REARRANGE THEMSELVES FORM BIPARTISAN COMMITTEES BUT AS THE MORAL ELECTROMAGNET GOT CRANKED UP THE FORCE FIELD INCREASED DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WERE PULLED APART IT BECAME MUCH HARDER FOR THEM TO SOCIALIZE MUCH HARDER FOR THEM TO COOPERATE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@436.36:441.04 RETIRING MEMBERS NOWADAYS SAY THAT IT 'S BECOME LIKE GANG WARFARE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@441.04:454.53 DID ANYBODY NOTICE THAT IN TWO OF THE THREE DEBATES OBAMA WORE A BLUE TIE AND ROMNEY WORE A RED TIE DO YOU KNOW WHY THEY DO THIS IT 'S SO THAT THE BLOODS AND THE CRIPS WILL KNOW WHICH SIDE TO VOTE FOR
JonathanHaidt_2012S@462.45:466.29 WELL IN THE LAST TWELVE YEARS IT 'S BECOME MUCH MORE APPARENT THAT IT IS
JonathanHaidt_2012S@466.29:483.7 SO LOOK AT THIS DATA THIS IS FROM THE AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTIONS SURVEY AND WHAT THEY DO ON THAT SURVEY IS THEY ASK WHAT 'S CALLED A FEELING THERMOMETER RATING SO HOW WARM OR COLD DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOU KNOW NATIVE AMERICANS OR THE MILITARY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ALL SORTS OF GROUPS IN AMERICAN LIFE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@483.7:495.06 THE BLUE LINE SHOWS HOW WARMLY DEMOCRATS FEEL ABOUT DEMOCRATS AND THEY LIKE THEM YOU KNOW RATINGS IN THE SEVENTY S ON A ONE HUNDRED POINT SCALE REPUBLICANS LIKE REPUBLICANS THAT 'S NOT A SURPRISE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@528.23:531.74 IT 'S AS THOUGH THE MORAL ELECTROMAGNET IS AFFECTING US TOO IT 'S LIKE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@531.74:541.46 PUT OUT IN THE TWO OCEANS AND IT 'S PULLING THE WHOLE COUNTRY APART PULLING LEFT AND RIGHT INTO THEIR OWN TERRITORIES LIKE THE BLOODS AND THE CRIPS
JonathanHaidt_2012S@541.46:558.26 NOW THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY THIS IS HAPPENING TO US AND MANY OF THEM WE CANNOT REVERSE WE WILL NEVER AGAIN HAVE A POLITICAL CLASS THAT WAS FORGED BY THE EXPERIENCE OF FIGHTING TOGETHER IN WORLD WAR II AGAINST A COMMON ENEMY WE WILL NEVER AGAIN
JonathanHaidt_2012S@558.26:563 HAVE JUST THREE TELEVISION NETWORKS ALL OF WHICH ARE RELATIVELY CENTRIST
JonathanHaidt_2012S@563:576.18 AND WE WILL NEVER AGAIN HAVE A LARGE GROUP OF CONSERVATIVE SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS AND LIBERAL NORTHERN REPUBLICANS MAKING IT EASY MAKING THERE BE A LOT OF OVERLAP FOR BIPARTISAN COOPERATION
JonathanHaidt_2012S@576.18:584.28 SO FOR A LOT OF REASONS THOSE DECADES AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR WERE AN HISTORICALLY ANOMALOUS TIME WE WILL NEVER GET BACK TO THOSE LOW LEVELS OF POLARIZATION I BELIEVE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@584.28:600.63 BUT THERE 'S A LOT THAT WE CAN DO THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF REFORMS WE CAN DO THAT WILL MAKE THINGS BETTER BECAUSE A LOT OF OUR DYSFUNCTION CAN BE TRACED DIRECTLY TO THINGS THAT CONGRESS DID TO ITSELF IN THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY S THAT CREATED A MUCH MORE POLARIZED AND DYSFUNCTIONAL INSTITUTION
JonathanHaidt_2012S@600.82:605.48 THESE CHANGES ARE DETAILED IN MANY BOOKS THESE ARE TWO THAT I STRONGLY RECOMMEND
JonathanHaidt_2012S@605.48:610.47 AND THEY LIST A WHOLE BUNCH OF REFORMS I 'M JUST GOING TO GROUP THEM INTO THREE BROAD CLASSES HERE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@610.47:628.63 SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS AS THE PROBLEM OF A DYSFUNCTIONAL HYPER POLARIZED INSTITUTION WELL THE FIRST STEP IS DO WHAT YOU CAN SO THAT FEWER HYPER PARTISANS GET ELECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WHEN YOU HAVE CLOSED PARTY PRIMARIES AND ONLY THE MOST COMMITTED REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ARE VOTING YOU 'RE NOMINATING AND SELECTING
JonathanHaidt_2012S@628.63:630.65 THE MOST EXTREME HYPER PARTISANS
JonathanHaidt_2012S@630.65:634.17 SO OPEN PRIMARIES WOULD MAKE THAT PROBLEM MUCH MUCH LESS SEVERE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@634.17:638.78 BUT THE PROBLEM ISN 'T PRIMARILY THAT WE 'RE ELECTING BAD PEOPLE TO CONGRESS
JonathanHaidt_2012S@639.11:657.53 FROM MY EXPERIENCE AND FROM WHAT I 'VE HEARD FROM CONGRESSIONAL INSIDERS MOST OF THE PEOPLE GOING TO CONGRESS ARE GOOD HARD WORKING INTELLIGENT PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT TO SOLVE PROBLEMS BUT ONCE THEY GET THERE THEY FIND THAT THEY ARE FORCED TO PLAY A GAME THAT REWARDS HYPER PARTISANSHIP AND THAT PUNISHES INDEPENDENT THINKING YOU STEP OUT OF LINE YOU GET PUNISHED
JonathanHaidt_2012S@657.53:676.85 SO THERE ARE A LOT OF REFORMS WE COULD DO THAT WILL COUNTERACT THIS FOR EXAMPLE THIS CITIZENS UNITED RULING IS A DISASTER BECAUSE IT MEANS THERE 'S LIKE A MONEY GUN AIMED AT YOUR HEAD AND IF YOU STEP OUT OF LINE IF YOU TRY TO REACH ACROSS THE AISLE THERE 'S A TON OF MONEY WAITING TO BE GIVEN TO YOUR OPPONENT TO MAKE EVERYBODY THINK THAT YOU ARE A TERRIBLE PERSON THROUGH NEGATIVE ADVERTISING
JonathanHaidt_2012S@676.85:689.97 BUT THE THIRD CLASS OF REFORMS IS THAT WE 'VE GOT TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS IN CONGRESS THE POLITICIANS I 'VE MET ARE GENERALLY VERY EXTROVERTED FRIENDLY VERY SOCIALLY SKILLFUL PEOPLE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@722.05:728.39 AND TRYING TO RUN CONGRESS WITHOUT HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS IS LIKE TRYING TO RUN A CAR WITHOUT MOTOR OIL
JonathanHaidt_2012S@728.39:743.99 SHOULD WE BE SURPRISED WHEN THE WHOLE THING FREEZES UP AND DESCENDS INTO PARALYSIS AND POLARIZATION A SIMPLE CHANGE TO THE LEGISLATIVE CALENDAR SUCH AS HAVING BUSINESS STRETCH OUT FOR THREE WEEKS AND THEN THEY GET A WEEK OFF TO GO HOME THAT WOULD CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIPS IN CONGRESS
JonathanHaidt_2012S@743.99:762.03 SO THERE 'S A LOT WE CAN DO BUT WHO 'S GOING TO PUSH THEM TO DO IT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF GROUPS THAT ARE WORKING ON THIS NO LABELS AND COMMON CAUSE I THINK HAVE VERY GOOD IDEAS FOR CHANGES WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE OUR DEMOCRACY MORE RESPONSIVE AND OUR CONGRESS MORE EFFECTIVE BUT I 'D LIKE TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR WORK WITH A LITTLE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRICK
JonathanHaidt_2012S@777.26:796.73 PULL US APART SOMETIMES A SINGLE THREAT CAN POLARIZE US AS WE SAW BUT WHAT IF THE SITUATION WE FACE IS NOT A SINGLE THREAT BUT IS ACTUALLY MORE LIKE THIS WHERE THERE 'S JUST SO MUCH STUFF COMING IN IT 'S JUST START SHOOTING COME ON EVERYBODY WE 'VE GOT TO JUST WORK TOGETHER JUST START SHOOTING BECAUSE ACTUALLY WE DO FACE THIS SITUATION THIS IS WHERE WE ARE AS A COUNTRY
JonathanHaidt_2012S@796.73:811.96 SO HERE 'S ANOTHER ASTEROID WE 'VE ALL SEEN VERSIONS OF THIS GRAPH RIGHT WHICH SHOWS THE CHANGES IN WEALTH SINCE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE AND AS YOU CAN SEE ALMOST ALL THE GAINS IN WEALTH HAVE GONE TO THE TOP TWENTY PERCENT AND ESPECIALLY THE TOP ONE PERCENT
JonathanHaidt_2012S@811.96:824.86 RISING INEQUALITY LIKE THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH SO MANY PROBLEMS FOR A DEMOCRACY ESPECIALLY IT DESTROYS OUR ABILITY TO TRUST EACH OTHER TO FEEL THAT WE 'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT BECAUSE IT 'S OBVIOUS WE 'RE NOT SOME OF US ARE SITTING THERE SAFE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@834.46:840.48 THE LEFT HAS BEEN SCREAMING ABOUT THIS ASTEROID FOR THIRTY YEARS NOW AND THE RIGHT SAYS HUH WHAT HMM NO PROBLEM
JonathanHaidt_2012S@840.48:842.73 NO PROBLEM
JonathanHaidt_2012S@866.33:885.36 WITHIN A DECADE OR TWO MOST AMERICAN CHILDREN WILL BE BORN INTO HOMES WITH NO FATHER THIS MEANS THAT THERE 'S MUCH LESS MONEY COMING INTO THE HOUSE BUT IT 'S NOT JUST MONEY IT 'S ALSO STABILITY VERSUS CHAOS AS I KNOW FROM WORKING WITH STREET CHILDREN IN BRAZIL MOM 'S BOYFRIEND IS OFTEN A REALLY REALLY DANGEROUS PERSON FOR KIDS
JonathanHaidt_2012S@885.36:893.33 NOW THE RIGHT HAS BEEN SCREAMING ABOUT THIS ASTEROID SINCE THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY S AND THE LEFT HAS BEEN SAYING IT 'S NOT A PROBLEM IT 'S NOT A PROBLEM
JonathanHaidt_2012S@893.33:910.57 THE LEFT HAS BEEN VERY RELUCTANT TO SAY THAT MARRIAGE IS ACTUALLY GOOD FOR WOMEN AND FOR CHILDREN NOW LET ME BE CLEAR I 'M NOT BLAMING THE WOMEN HERE I 'M ACTUALLY MORE CRITICAL OF THE MEN WHO WON 'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN CHILDREN AND OF AN ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR MANY MEN TO EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO SUPPORT THOSE CHILDREN
JonathanHaidt_2012S@910.57:912.65 BUT EVEN IF YOU BLAME NOBODY
JonathanHaidt_2012S@912.65:926.75 IT STILL IS A NATIONAL PROBLEM AND ONE SIDE HAS BEEN MORE CONCERNED ABOUT IT THAN THE OTHER THE NEW YORK TIMES FINALLY NOTICED THIS ASTEROID WITH A FRONT PAGE STORY LAST JULY SHOWING HOW THE DECLINE OF MARRIAGE CONTRIBUTES TO INEQUALITY
JonathanHaidt_2012S@926.75:946.53 WE ARE BECOMING A NATION OF JUST TWO CLASSES WHEN AMERICANS GO TO COLLEGE AND MARRY EACH OTHER THEY HAVE VERY LOW DIVORCE RATES THEY EARN A LOT OF MONEY THEY INVEST THAT MONEY IN THEIR KIDS SOME OF THEM BECOME TIGER MOTHERS THE KIDS RISE TO THEIR FULL POTENTIAL AND THE KIDS GO ON TO BECOME THE TOP TWO LINES
JonathanHaidt_2012S@946.53:952.15 IN THIS GRAPH AND THEN THERE 'S EVERYBODY ELSE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@952.15:961.63 THE CHILDREN WHO DON 'T BENEFIT FROM A STABLE MARRIAGE WHO DON 'T HAVE AS MUCH INVESTED IN THEM WHO DON 'T GROW UP IN A STABLE ENVIRONMENT AND WHO GO ON TO BECOME THE BOTTOM THREE LINES
JonathanHaidt_2012S@961.63:975.44 IN THAT GRAPH SO ONCE AGAIN WE SEE THAT THESE TWO GRAPHS ARE ACTUALLY SAYING THE SAME THING AS BEFORE WE 'VE GOT A PROBLEM WE 'VE GOT TO START WORKING ON THIS WE 'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING AND WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE THAT YOU DON 'T SEE MY THREAT
JonathanHaidt_2012S@975.44:983.49 BUT IF EVERYBODY COULD JUST TAKE OFF THEIR PARTISAN BLINDERS WE 'D SEE THAT THESE TWO PROBLEMS ACTUALLY ARE BEST ADDRESSED TOGETHER
JonathanHaidt_2012S@983.49:997.57 BECAUSE IF YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT INCOME INEQUALITY YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK TO SOME EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN GROUPS THAT ARE WORKING ON WAYS TO PROMOTE MARRIAGE BUT THEN YOU 'RE GOING TO RUN SMACK INTO THE PROBLEM THAT WOMEN DON 'T GENERALLY WANT TO MARRY SOMEONE WHO DOESN 'T HAVE A JOB
JonathanHaidt_2012S@997.57:1015.19 SO IF YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT STRENGTHENING FAMILIES YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK TO SOME LIBERAL GROUPS WHO ARE WORKING ON PROMOTING EDUCATIONAL EQUALITY WHO ARE WORKING ON RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE WHO ARE WORKING ON FINDING WAYS TO STOP SO MANY MEN FROM BEING SUCKED INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND TAKEN OUT OF THE MARRIAGE MARKET FOR THEIR WHOLE LIVES
JonathanHaidt_2012S@1015.19:1032.62 SO TO CONCLUDE THERE ARE AT LEAST FOUR ASTEROIDS HEADED OUR WAY HOW MANY OF YOU CAN SEE ALL FOUR PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND RIGHT NOW IF YOU 'RE WILLING TO ADMIT THAT ALL FOUR OF THESE ARE NATIONAL PROBLEMS PLEASE RAISE YOUR HANDS OKAY ALMOST ALL OF YOU
JonathanHaidt_2012S@1032.62:1037.24 WELL CONGRATULATIONS YOU GUYS ARE THE INAUGURAL MEMBERS OF THE ASTEROIDS CLUB
JonathanHaidt_2012S@1037.24:1053.53 WHICH IS A CLUB FOR ALL AMERICANS WHO ARE WILLING TO ADMIT THAT THE OTHER SIDE ACTUALLY MIGHT HAVE A POINT IN THE ASTEROIDS CLUB WE DON 'T START BY LOOKING FOR COMMON GROUND COMMON GROUND IS OFTEN VERY HARD TO FIND NO WE START BY LOOKING FOR COMMON THREATS BECAUSE COMMON THREATS
JonathanHaidt_2012S@1053.53:1064.08 MAKE COMMON GROUND NOW AM I BEING NAIVE IS IT NAIVE TO THINK THAT PEOPLE COULD EVER LAY DOWN THEIR SWORDS AND LEFT AND RIGHT COULD ACTUALLY WORK TOGETHER
JonathanHaidt_2012S@1064.08:1076.36 I DON 'T THINK SO BECAUSE IT HAPPENS NOT ALL THAT OFTEN BUT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF EXAMPLES THAT POINT THE WAY THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO BECAUSE AMERICANS ON BOTH SIDES CARE ABOUT THE DECLINE IN CIVILITY
JonathanHaidt_2012S@1076.36:1080.18 AND THEY 'VE FORMED DOZENS OF ORGANIZATIONS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL SUCH AS THIS ONE
JonathanHaidt_2012S@1080.18:1087.9 DOWN TO MANY LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS TO THE VILLAGE SQUARE IN TALLAHASSEE FLORIDA WHICH TRIES TO BRING STATE LEADERS TOGETHER TO HELP FACILITATE THAT SORT OF
JonathanHaidt_2012S@1107.37:1126.41 AND MOST SURPRISINGLY TO ME THEY SOMETIMES CAN EVEN SEE EYE TO EYE ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE FOR EXAMPLE THE INCARCERATION RATE THE PRISON POPULATION IN THIS COUNTRY HAS QUADRUPLED SINCE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NOW THIS IS A SOCIAL DISASTER AND LIBERALS ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER
JonathanHaidt_2012S@1126.41:1132.87 IS OFTEN FIGHTING THE PRISON INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX FIGHTING TO PREVENT A SYSTEM THAT 'S JUST SUCKING IN MORE AND MORE POOR YOUNG MEN
JonathanHaidt_2012S@1132.87:1141.45 BUT ARE CONSERVATIVES HAPPY ABOUT THIS WELL GROVER NORQUIST ISN 'T BECAUSE THIS SYSTEM COSTS AN UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY
JonathanHaidt_2012S@1141.45:1148.14 AND SO BECAUSE THE PRISON INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX IS BANKRUPTING OUR STATES AND CORRODING OUR SOULS
JonathanHaidt_2012S@1148.14:1158.77 GROUPS OF FISCAL CONSERVATIVES AND CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVES HAVE COME TOGETHER TO FORM A GROUP CALLED RIGHT ON CRIME AND AT TIMES THEY HAVE WORKED WITH THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER
JonathanHaidt_2012S@1158.77:1178.46 TO OPPOSE THE BUILDING OF NEW PRISONS AND TO WORK FOR REFORMS THAT WILL MAKE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE HUMANE SO THIS IS POSSIBLE WE CAN DO IT LET US THEREFORE GO TO BATTLE STATIONS NOT TO FIGHT EACH OTHER BUT TO BEGIN DEFLECTING THESE INCOMING ASTEROIDS
