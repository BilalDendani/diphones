LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT A DISTURBING QUESTION WHICH HAS AN EQUALLY DISTURBING ANSWER
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X MY TOPIC IS THE SECRETS OF DOMESTIC
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND THE QUESTION I 'M GOING TO TACKLE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X IS THE ONE QUESTION EVERYONE ALWAYS ASKS
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X WHY DOES SHE STAY WHY WOULD ANYONE STAY WITH A MAN WHO BEATS HER
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I 'M NOT A PSYCHIATRIST A SOCIAL WORKER
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X OR AN EXPERT IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I 'M JUST ONE WOMAN WITH A STORY TO TELL
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I WAS TWENTY TWO I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE I HAD MOVED TO NEW YORK CITY FOR MY FIRST JOB AS A WRITER AND EDITOR AT SEVENTEEN MAGAZINE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I HAD MY FIRST APARTMENT MY FIRST LITTLE GREEN AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND I HAD A VERY BIG SECRET
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X MY SECRET WAS
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X POINTED AT MY HEAD BY THE MAN WHO I THOUGHT WAS MY SOULMATE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X MANY MANY TIMES
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X THE MAN WHO I LOVED
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X MORE THAN ANYBODY ON EARTH
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X HELD A GUN TO MY HEAD AND THREATENED TO KILL ME
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X MORE TIMES THAN I CAN EVEN REMEMBER
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I 'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X A PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP DISGUISED AS LOVE ONE THAT MILLIONS OF WOMEN AND EVEN A FEW
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X FALL INTO EVERY YEAR
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X IT MAY EVEN BE YOUR STORY I DON 'T LOOK LIKE A TYPICAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR I HAVE A B A IN ENGLISH FROM HARVARD COLLEGE AN MBA IN MARKETING FROM WHARTON BUSINESS SCHOOL I 'VE SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER WORKING FOR FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES INCLUDING JOHNSON JOHNSON LEO BURNETT AND THE WASHINGTON POST
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I 'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS TO MY SECOND HUSBAND AND WE HAVE THREE KIDS TOGETHER
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X MY DOG IS A BLACK LAB AND I DRIVE A HONDA ODYSSEY MINIVAN
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X ALL RACES ALL RELIGIONS ALL INCOME AND EDUCATION LEVELS IT 'S EVERYWHERE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND MY SECOND MESSAGE IS THAT EVERYONE THINKS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAPPENS TO WOMEN THAT IT 'S A WOMEN 'S ISSUE NOT EXACTLY
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X OVER EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF ABUSERS ARE MEN
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND DOMESTIC ABUSE HAPPENS ONLY IN INTIMATE INTERDEPENDENT LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X IN OTHER WORDS IN FAMILIES THE LAST PLACE WE WOULD WANT OR EXPECT TO FIND VIOLENCE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X WHICH IS ONE REASON DOMESTIC ABUSE IS SO CONFUSING I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU MYSELF THAT I WAS THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH WHO WOULD STAY WITH A MAN WHO BEATS ME BUT IN FACT I WAS A VERY TYPICAL VICTIM BECAUSE OF MY AGE I WAS TWENTY TWO AND IN THE UNITED STATES
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X WOMEN AGES SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR ARE THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS AS WOMEN OF OTHER AGES
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND OVER FIVE HUNDRED WOMEN AND GIRLS THIS AGE ARE KILLED EVERY YEAR BY ABUSIVE PARTNERS BOYFRIENDS AND HUSBANDS IN THE UNITED STATES
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I WAS ALSO A VERY TYPICAL VICTIM BECAUSE I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ITS WARNING SIGNS OR ITS PATTERNS
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I MET CONOR
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X ON A COLD RAINY JANUARY NIGHT
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X HE SAT NEXT TO ME ON THE NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND HE STARTED CHATTING ME UP
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X HE TOLD ME TWO THINGS ONE WAS THAT HE TOO HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND THAT HE WORKED AT A VERY IMPRESSIVE WALL STREET BANK
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X BUT WHAT MADE THE BIGGEST IMPRESSION ON ME THAT FIRST MEETING WAS THAT HE WAS SMART AND FUNNY
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND HE LOOKED LIKE A FARM BOY HE HAD THESE BIG CHEEKS THESE BIG APPLE CHEEKS AND THIS WHEAT BLOND HAIR AND HE SEEMED SO SWEET
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X ONE OF THE SMARTEST THINGS CONOR DID FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WAS TO CREATE THE ILLUSION THAT I WAS THE DOMINANT PARTNER IN THE RELATIONSHIP
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X HE DID THIS ESPECIALLY AT THE BEGINNING BY IDOLIZING ME
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X WE STARTED DATING AND HE LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT ME THAT I WAS SMART THAT I 'D GONE TO HARVARD THAT I WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT HELPING TEENAGE GIRLS AND MY JOB HE WANTED TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT MY FAMILY AND MY CHILDHOOD AND MY HOPES AND DREAMS CONOR BELIEVED IN ME AS A WRITER AND A WOMAN IN A WAY THAT NO ONE ELSE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X HE HAD BEEN SAVAGELY AND REPEATEDLY PHYSICALLY ABUSED BY HIS STEPFATHER AND THE ABUSE HAD GOTTEN SO BAD THAT HE HAD HAD TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL IN EIGHTH GRADE EVEN THOUGH HE WAS VERY SMART AND HE 'D SPENT ALMOST TWENTY YEARS REBUILDING HIS LIFE WHICH IS WHY
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X THAT IVY LEAGUE DEGREE AND THE WALL STREET JOB AND HIS BRIGHT SHINY FUTURE MEANT SO MUCH TO HIM
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X IF YOU HAD TOLD ME
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X THAT THIS SMART
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X FUNNY SENSITIVE MAN WHO ADORED ME
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X WOULD ONE DAY DICTATE WHETHER OR NOT I WORE MAKEUP
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X HOW SHORT MY SKIRTS WERE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X WHERE I LIVED WHAT JOBS I TOOK WHO MY FRIENDS WERE AND WHERE I SPENT CHRISTMAS
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT YOU BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT A HINT OF VIOLENCE OR CONTROL OR ANGER IN CONOR
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X THAT THE FIRST STAGE IN ANY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATIONSHIP
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X IS TO SEDUCE AND CHARM THE VICTIM
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I ALSO DIDN 'T KNOW THAT THE SECOND STEP IS TO ISOLATE THE VICTIM NOW CONOR DID NOT
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X COME HOME ONE DAY AND ANNOUNCE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X INSTEAD CONOR CAME HOME ONE FRIDAY EVENING
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD QUIT HIS JOB THAT DAY HIS DREAM JOB
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND HE SAID THAT HE HAD QUIT HIS JOB BECAUSE OF ME
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X BECAUSE I HAD MADE HIM FEEL SO SAFE AND LOVED THAT HE DIDN 'T NEED TO PROVE HIMSELF ON WALL STREET ANYMORE AND HE JUST WANTED TO GET OUT OF THE CITY AND AWAY FROM HIS ABUSIVE DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY AND MOVE TO A TINY TOWN IN NEW ENGLAND WHERE HE COULD START HIS LIFE OVER WITH ME BY HIS SIDE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X NOW THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO WAS LEAVE NEW YORK
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND MY DREAM JOB
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X BUT I THOUGHT YOU MADE SACRIFICES FOR YOUR SOULMATE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I HAD NO IDEA
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I WAS FALLING INTO CRAZY LOVE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X THAT I WAS WALKING HEADFIRST INTO A CAREFULLY LAID PHYSICAL FINANCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X THE NEXT STEP IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PATTERN IS TO INTRODUCE THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE AND SEE HOW SHE REACTS
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND HERE 'S WHERE THOSE GUNS COME IN
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AS SOON AS WE MOVED TO NEW ENGLAND
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X YOU KNOW THAT PLACE WHERE CONNOR WAS SUPPOSED TO FEEL SO SAFE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X HE BOUGHT THREE GUNS HE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X HE KEPT ONE UNDER THE PILLOWS ON OUR BED
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND THE THIRD ONE HE KEPT IN HIS POCKET AT ALL TIMES
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND HE SAID THAT HE NEEDED THOSE GUNS BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMA HE 'D EXPERIENCED AS A YOUNG BOY HE NEEDED THEM TO FEEL PROTECTED BUT THOSE GUNS WERE REALLY A MESSAGE FOR ME
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND EVEN THOUGH HE HADN 'T RAISED A HAND TO ME MY LIFE WAS ALREADY IN GRAVE DANGER EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X CONOR FIRST PHYSICALLY ATTACKED
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I WAS WORKING ON MY COMPUTER TRYING TO FINISH A FREELANCE WRITING ASSIGNMENT AND I GOT FRUSTRATED
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND CONOR USED MY ANGER AS AN EXCUSE TO PUT BOTH OF HIS HANDS AROUND MY NECK
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND TO SQUEEZE SO TIGHTLY THAT I COULD NOT BREATHE OR SCREAM
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND HE USED THE CHOKEHOLD
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X TO HIT MY HEAD REPEATEDLY AGAINST THE WALL
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X FIVE DAYS LATER
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X THE TEN BRUISES ON MY NECK HAD JUST FADED
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X DESPITE WHAT HAD HAPPENED I WAS SURE WE WERE GOING TO LIVE HAPPILY EVER
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X IT WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT AND HE WAS NEVER GOING TO HURT ME AGAIN
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X IT HAPPENED TWICE MORE ON THE HONEYMOON
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X THE FIRST TIME I WAS DRIVING TO FIND A SECRET BEACH
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND I GOT LOST AND HE PUNCHED ME IN THE SIDE OF MY HEAD SO HARD
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X THAT THE OTHER SIDE OF MY HEAD REPEATEDLY HIT THE DRIVER 'S SIDE WINDOW
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND THEN A FEW DAYS LATER DRIVING HOME FROM OUR HONEYMOON
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X HE GOT FRUSTRATED BY TRAFFIC
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND HE THREW A COLD BIG MAC IN MY FACE CONOR PROCEEDED TO BEAT ME ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK FOR THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF OUR MARRIAGE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I WAS MISTAKEN IN THINKING THAT I WAS UNIQUE AND ALONE IN THIS SITUATION ONE IN THREE AMERICAN WOMEN EXPERIENCES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR STALKING AT SOME POINT IN HER LIFE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND THE CDC REPORTS THAT FIFTEEN MILLION CHILDREN ARE ABUSED EVERY YEAR
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X BACK TO MY QUESTION
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I DIDN 'T KNOW HE WAS ABUSING
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X EVEN THOUGH HE HELD THOSE LOADED GUNS TO MY HEAD PUSHED ME DOWN STAIRS THREATENED TO KILL OUR DOG PULLED THE KEY OUT OF THE CAR IGNITION AS I DROVE DOWN THE HIGHWAY POURED COFFEE GRINDS ON MY HEAD
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AS I DRESSED FOR A JOB INTERVIEW I NEVER ONCE THOUGHT OF MYSELF AS A BATTERED WIFE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X INSTEAD I WAS A VERY STRONG WOMAN IN LOVE WITH A DEEPLY TROUBLED MAN
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND I WAS THE ONLY PERSON ON EARTH
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X WHO COULD HELP CONOR FACE HIS DEMONS
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X THE OTHER QUESTION EVERYBODY ASKS IS
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X WHY DIDN 'T I WALK OUT
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I COULD HAVE LEFT ANY TIME TO ME THIS IS THE SADDEST AND MOST PAINFUL QUESTION THAT PEOPLE ASK
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X BECAUSE WE VICTIMS KNOW SOMETHING YOU USUALLY DON 'T
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X IT 'S INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS TO LEAVE AN ABUSER BECAUSE THE FINAL STEP IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PATTERN IS KILL HER
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X OVER SEVENTY PERCENT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MURDERS HAPPEN AFTER THE VICTIM HAS ENDED THE RELATIONSHIP
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X OTHER OUTCOMES INCLUDE LONG TERM STALKING
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X EVEN AFTER THE ABUSER REMARRIES DENIAL OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND MANIPULATION OF THE FAMILY COURT SYSTEM TO TERRIFY THE VICTIM AND HER CHILDREN WHO ARE REGULARLY FORCED BY FAMILY COURT JUDGES TO SPEND UNSUPERVISED TIME WITH THE MAN WHO BEAT THEIR MOTHER
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND STILL WE ASK WHY DOESN 'T SHE JUST LEAVE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I WAS ABLE TO LEAVE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X BECAUSE OF ONE FINAL SADISTIC BEATING THAT BROKE THROUGH MY DENIAL
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I REALIZED THAT THE MAN WHO I LOVED SO MUCH
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X WAS GOING TO KILL ME IF I LET HIM
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X SO I BROKE THE SILENCE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I TOLD EVERYONE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND I 'M HERE TODAY
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X BECAUSE YOU ALL HELPED ME
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X WE TEND TO STEREOTYPE VICTIMS AS GRISLY HEADLINES SELF DESTRUCTIVE WOMEN DAMAGED GOODS THE QUESTION WHY DOES SHE STAY
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X IS CODE FOR SOME PEOPLE FOR
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X BUT SINCE PUBLISHING CRAZY LOVE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X I HAVE HEARD HUNDREDS OF STORIES FROM MEN AND WOMEN WHO ALSO GOT OUT
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X WHO LEARNED AN INVALUABLE LIFE LESSON
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X FROM WHAT HAPPENED AND WHO REBUILT LIVES JOYOUS
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X HAPPY LIVES AS EMPLOYEES WIVES AND MOTHERS LIVES COMPLETELY FREE OF VIOLENCE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X LIKE ME

LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND WE HAVE THOSE THREE KIDS I HAVE THAT BLACK LAB
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X AND I HAVE THAT MINIVAN WHAT I WILL NEVER HAVE AGAIN

LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X WHO ARE CURRENTLY BEING ABUSED

LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X ABUSE THRIVES ONLY IN SILENCE
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X YOU HAVE THE POWER
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
