BrendaLaurel_1998 I MET WITH DAVID TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I MIGHT DO IN HIS COMPANY I WAS JUST COMING OUT OF A FAILED VIRTUAL REALITY BUSINESS AND SUPPORTING MY SELF BY BEING ON THE SPEAKING CIRCUIT AND WRITING BOOKS
BrendaLaurel_1998 AFTER TWENTY YEARS OR SO IN THE COMPUTER GAME INDUSTRY
BrendaLaurel_1998 HAVING IDEAS THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK THEY COULD SELL
BrendaLaurel_1998 JUST BE A GIANT SEXIST CONSPIRACY THESE PEOPLE AREN'T THAT SMART THERE'S SIX BILLION DOLLARS ON THE TABLE
BrendaLaurel_1998 THEY WOULD GO FOR IT IF THEY COULD FIGURE OUT HOW SO WHAT IS THE DEAL HERE
BrendaLaurel_1998 AND AS WE THOUGHT ABOUT OUR GOALS
BrendaLaurel_1998 I SHOULD SAY THAT INTERVAL IS REALLY A HUMANISTIC INSTITUTION IN THE CLASSICAL SENSE THAT HUMANISM AT ITS BEST FINDS A WAY TO COMBINE
BrendaLaurel_1998 CLEAR EYED EMPIRICAL RESEARCH WITH A SET OF CORE VALUES THAT FUNDAMENTALLY LOVE AND RESPECT PEOPLE THE BASIC IDEA OF HUMANISM IS THE IMPROVABLE
BrendaLaurel_1998 QUALITY OF LIFE THAT
BrendaLaurel_1998 WE CAN DO GOOD THINGS THAT THERE ARE
BrendaLaurel_1998 THINGS WORTH DOING BECAUSE THEY'RE GOOD THINGS TO DO AND THAT CLEAR EYED EMPIRICISM CAN HELP US FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THEM
BrendaLaurel_1998 SO CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF THERE IS NOT A CONFLICT OF INTEREST BETWEEN EMPIRICISM AND VALUES
BrendaLaurel_1998 WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET A LITTLE GIRL TO PUT HER HANDS ON A COMPUTER TO ACHIEVE THE LEVEL OF COMFORT AND EASE WITH THE TECHNOLOGY THAT LITTLE BOYS HAVE BECAUSE THEY PLAY VIDEO GAMES
BrendaLaurel_1998 WE SPENT TWO AND A HALF YEARS CONDUCTING RESEARCH WE SPENT ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF IN ADVANCE DEVELOPMENT
BrendaLaurel_1998 THEN WE FORMED A SPIN OFF COMPANY AND THE RESEARCH PHASE OF THE PROJECT AT INTERVAL WE PARTNERED WITH A COMPANY CALLED CHESKIN RESEARCH AND THESE PEOPLE
BrendaLaurel_1998 AND THEY DID NOT DO THE INCREDIBLY STUPID THING OF SAYING TO A CHILD OF ALL THESE THINGS WE ALREADY MAKE YOU WHICH DO YOU LIKE BEST WHICH GIVES YOU ZERO ANSWER THAT'S USABLE
BrendaLaurel_1998 SO WHAT WE DID FOR THE FIRST TWO AND A HALF YEARS WAS FOUR THINGS WE DID AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE IN RELATED FIELDS LIKE COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY SPACIAL COGNITION GENDER STUDIES PLAY THEORY SOCIOLOGY PRIMATOLOGY THANK YOU FRANS DE WAAL WHEREVER YOU ARE I LOVE YOU AND I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO MEET YOU
BrendaLaurel_1998 AFTER WE HAD DONE THAT WITH A PRETTY LARGE TEAM OF PEOPLE AND DISCOVERED WHAT WE THOUGHT THE SALIENT ISSUES WERE WITH GIRLS AND BOYS AND PLAYING BECAUSE AFTER ALL THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT
BrendaLaurel_1998 WE MOVED TO THE SECOND PHASE OF OUR WORK WHERE WE INTERVIEWED ADULT EXPERTS IN ACADEMIA SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO 'D PRODUCED THE LITERATURE THAT WE FOUND RELEVANT AND ALSO WE DID FOCUS GROUPS WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THE GROUND WITH KIDS EVERY DAY LIKE PLAYGROUND SUPERVISORS TALKED TO THEM
BrendaLaurel_1998 THEN WE DID WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE THE HEART OF THE WORK INTERVIEWED ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED CHILDREN BOYS AND GIRLS AGES SEVEN TO TWELVE ALL OVER
BrendaLaurel_1998 UNITED STATES EXCEPT FOR SILICON VALLEY BOSTON AND AUSTIN BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT THEIR LITTLE FAMILIES WOULD HAVE MILLIONS OF COMPUTERS IN THEM AND THEY WOULDN'T BE A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE
BrendaLaurel_1998 AND AT THE END OF THOSE REMARKABLE CONVERSATIONS WITH KIDS AND THEIR BEST FRIENDS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AFTER TWO YEARS
BrendaLaurel_1998 WE PULLED TOGETHER SOME SURVEY DATA FROM ANOTHER TEN THOUSAND CHILDREN DREW UP A SET UP OF WHAT WE THOUGHT WERE THE KEY FINDINGS OF OUR RESEARCH
BrendaLaurel_1998 AND SPENT ANOTHER YEAR TRANSFORMING THEM INTO DESIGN HEURISTICS FOR DESIGNING COMPUTER BASED PRODUCTS AND IN FACT ANY KIND OF PRODUCTS FOR LITTLE GIRLS AGES EIGHT TO TWELVE
BrendaLaurel_1998 THAT HAS NOW SERVED TWENTY FIVE MILLION PAGES AND HAS FORTY TWO THOUSAND REGISTERED YOUNG GIRL USERS WHO SPEND
BrendaLaurel_1998 AN AVERAGE OF THEY VISIT AN AVERAGE OF ONE AND A HALF TIMES A DAY SPEND AN AVERAGE OF THIRTY FIVE MINUTES A VISIT AND LOOK AT FIFTY PAGES
BrendaLaurel_1998 SO WE FEEL THAT WE'VE FORMED A SUCCESSFUL ONLINE COMMUNITY WITH GIRLS WE LAUNCHED TWO TITLES IN OCTOBER ROCKETT 'S NEW SCHOOL WHICH IS THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF PRODUCTS ABOUT A CHARACTER CALLED ROCKETT BEGINNING HER FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL IN EIGHTH GRADE AT A BRAND NEW PLACE WITH A BLANK SLATE
BrendaLaurel_1998 WHICH ALLOWS GIRLS TO PLAY WITH THE QUESTION OF WHAT WILL I BE LIKE WHEN I'M OLDER WHAT 'S IT GOING TO BE LIKE TO BE IN HIGH SCHOOL OR JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL WHO ARE MY FRIENDS
BrendaLaurel_1998 TO EXERCISE THE LOVE OF SOCIAL COMPLEXITY AND THE NARRATIVE INTELLIGENCE THAT DRIVES MOST OF THEIR PLAY BEHAVIOR
BrendaLaurel_1998 AND WHICH EMBEDS IN IT VALUES ABOUT NOTICING THAT WE HAVE LOTS OF CHOICES IN OUR LIVES AND THE WAYS THAT WE CONDUCT OURSELVES
BrendaLaurel_1998 THE OTHER TITLE THAT WE LAUNCHED IS CALLED SECRET PATHS IN THE FOREST THAT ADDRESSES THE MORE FANTASY ORIENTED INNER LIVES OF GIRLS THESE TWO TITLES BOTH SHOWED UP IN THE TOP FIFTY ENTERTAINMENT TITLES IN PC DATA ENTERTAINMENT TITLES IN PC DATA
BrendaLaurel_1998 IN DECEMBER RIGHT UP THERE WITH JOHN MADDEN FOOTBALL WHICH THRILLS ME TO DEATH SO WE'RE REAL AND WE'VE TOUCHED SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LITTLE GIRLS NOW THEN
BrendaLaurel_1998 WE'VE MADE HALF A BILLION IMPRESSIONS WITH MARKETING AND PR FOR THIS BRAND PURPLE MOON NINETY SIX PERCENT OF THEM ROUGHLY HAVE BEEN POSITIVE FOUR PERCENT OF THEM HAVE BEEN OTHER
BrendaLaurel_1998 I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE OTHER BECAUSE THE POLITICS OF THIS ENTERPRISE IN A WAY HAVE BEEN THE MOST FASCINATING PART OF IT
BrendaLaurel_1998 REALLY TWO KINDS OF NEGATIVE REVIEWS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED ONE KIND OF REVIEWER IS A MALE GAMER WHO THINKS HE KNOWS WHAT GAMES OUGHT TO BE AND WON 'T SHOW THE PRODUCT TO LITTLE GIRLS
BrendaLaurel_1998 THE OTHER KIND OF REVIEWER IS A CERTAIN FLAVOR OF FEMINIST WHO THINKS THEY KNOW WHAT LITTLE GIRLS OUGHT TO BE
BrendaLaurel_1998 IT'S FUNNY TO ME THAT THESE INTERESTING ODD BEDFELLOWS HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON
BrendaLaurel_1998 THEY DON'T LISTEN TO LITTLE GIRLS
BrendaLaurel_1998 THEY HAVEN'T LOOKED AT CHILDREN
BrendaLaurel_1998 LIKE TO PLAY YOU SOME VOICES OF LITTLE GIRLS FROM THE TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF RESEARCH THAT WE DID ACTUALLY SOME OF THE VOICES ARE MORE RECENT
BrendaLaurel_1998 AND THESE VOICES WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY PHOTOGRAPHS THAT THEY TOOK FOR US OF THEIR LIVES OF THE THINGS THAT THEY VALUE AND CARE ABOUT THESE ARE PICTURES THE GIRLS THEMSELVES NEVER SAW BUT THEY GAVE TO US
BrendaLaurel_1998 THIS IS THE STUFF THOSE REVIEWERS DON'T KNOW ABOUT AND AREN'T LISTENING TO AND THIS IS THE KIND OF RESEARCH I RECOMMEND TO YOU WHO WANT TO DO HUMANISTIC WORK
BrendaLaurel_1998 YEAH MY CHARACTER IS USUALLY A TOMBOY HER 'S IS
BrendaLaurel_1998 WHAT ELSE
BrendaLaurel_1998 AND ALL THOSE
BrendaLaurel_1998 WE MAKE
BrendaLaurel_1998 NEWSPAPER ON THE COMPUTER FOR A GIRL 'S GAME ALSO USUALLY THEY'LL HAVE REALLY
BrendaLaurel_1998 YOU
BrendaLaurel_1998 AND I LOVE A LOT OF THINGS TO DO AND SOMETIMES I
BrendaLaurel_1998 SOMETIMES IT GETS ANNOYING WHEN YOU BROTHERS AND SISTERS OR BROTHER OR SISTER WHEN THEY COPY YOU AND YOU GET YOUR IDEA FIRST AND THEY TAKE YOUR IDEA AND THEY DO IT THEMSELVES
BrendaLaurel_1998 SHE
BrendaLaurel_1998 THIS IS THE SECOND DAY IN ROCKETT 'S LIFE AND THE REASON I'M SHOWING YOU THIS IS I'M HOPING THAT THE SCENE THAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WILL LOOK FAMILIAR AND SOUND FAMILIAR NOW THAT YOU'VE LISTENED TO SOME GIRLS VOICES
BrendaLaurel_1998 AND YOU CAN SEE HOW WE'VE TRIED TO INCORPORATE THE ISSUES THAT MATTER TO THEM IN
BrendaLaurel_1998 ASKED ME TO MAKE SURE YOU KNEW ABOUT
BrendaLaurel_1998 AWFUL EVENT OCCURS ROCKET GETS
BrendaLaurel_1998 WANT TO
BrendaLaurel_1998 'S
BrendaLaurel_1998 SO WE'RE GOING TO EMOTIONALLY NAVIGATE IF WE WERE PLAYING THE GAME THAT'S WHAT WE'D DO IF AT ANY TIME DURING THE GAME WE WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS WE CAN GO INTO THIS HIDDEN HALLWAY
BrendaLaurel_1998 AND I'LL QUICKLY JUST SHOW YOU THE INTERFACE WE CAN FOR EXAMPLE GO FIND MIKO 'S LOCKER
BrendaLaurel_1998 GIRLS THEIR DESIRES TO EXPERIENCE GREATER EMOTIONAL FLEXIBILITY AND TO PLAY AROUND WITH THE SOCIAL COMPLEXITY OF THEIR LIVES
BrendaLaurel_1998 I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT WHAT WE'RE GIVING GIRLS I THINK THROUGH THIS EFFORT IS A KIND OF VALIDATION A SENSE OF BEING SEEN AND A SENSE OF THE CHOICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THEIR LIVES WE LOVE THEM
BrendaLaurel_1998 WE SEE THEM
BrendaLaurel_1998 WE'RE NOT TRYING TO
BrendaLaurel_1998 BUT WE'RE REALLY REALLY HAPPY ABOUT WHO THEY ARE IT TURNS OUT THEY'RE REALLY GREAT I WANT TO CLOSE BY SHOWING YOU
