EWidder_2010Z WHO SAID PEOPLE PROTECT WHAT THEY LOVE I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY WHAT I LOVE MOST IN THE OCEAN AND THAT'S THE INCREDIBLE NUMBER AND VARIETY OF ANIMALS IN IT
EWidder_2010Z LIGHT MY ADDICTION BEGAN WITH THIS STRANGE LOOKING DIVING SUIT CALLED WASP THAT'S NOT AN ACRONYM JUST SOMEBODY THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE THE
EWidder_2010Z WAS AN EVENING DIVE I WENT DOWN TO A DEPTH OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FEET AND TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS
EWidder_2010Z AND THE REASON I TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS IS BECAUSE I KNEW I WOULD SEE THIS PHENOMENON OF ANIMALS MAKING LIGHT CALLED BIOLUMINESCENCE BUT I WAS TOTALLY UNPREPARED FOR HOW MUCH THERE WAS AND HOW SPECTACULAR IT WAS
EWidder_2010Z I SAW CHAINS OF JELLYFISH CALLED SIPHONOPHORES THAT WERE LONGER THAN THIS ROOM
EWidder_2010Z AND BILLOWS OF WHAT LOOKED LIKE LUMINOUS BLUE SMOKE AND EXPLOSIONS OF SPARKS THAT WOULD SWIRL UP OUT OF THE THRUSTERS JUST LIKE WHEN YOU THROW A LOG ON A CAMPFIRE AND THE EMBERS SWIRL UP OFF THE CAMPFIRE BUT THESE WERE ICY BLUE EMBERS IT WAS BREATHTAKING
EWidder_2010Z NOW USUALLY IF PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH BIOLUMINESCENCE AT ALL IT'S THESE GUYS IT'S FIREFLIES AND THERE ARE A FEW OTHER LAND DWELLERS THAT CAN MAKE LIGHT SOME INSECTS EARTHWORMS FUNGI BUT IN GENERAL ON LAND IT'S REALLY RARE
EWidder_2010Z IN THE OCEAN IT'S THE RULE RATHER THAN THE EXCEPTION
EWidder_2010Z IF I GO OUT IN THE OPEN OCEAN ENVIRONMENT VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND I DRAG A NET FROM THREE THOUSAND TO THE SURFACE
EWidder_2010Z MOST OF THE ANIMALS IN FACT IN MANY PLACES EIGHTY TO NINETY PERCENT OF THE ANIMALS I BRING UP IN THAT NET MAKE LIGHT
EWidder_2010Z THIS MAKES FOR SOME PRETTY SPECTACULAR LIGHT SHOWS
EWidder_2010Z NOW I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE VIDEO THAT I SHOT FROM A SUBMERSIBLE I FIRST DEVELOPED THIS TECHNIQUE WORKING FROM A LITTLE SINGLE PERSON SUBMERSIBLE CALLED DEEP ROVER AND THEN ADAPTED IT FOR USE ON THE JOHNSON SEA LINK WHICH YOU SEE HERE
EWidder_2010Z SO MOUNTED IN FRONT OF THE OBSERVATION SPHERE THERE'S A A THREE FOOT DIAMETER HOOP
EWidder_2010Z JUST ELECTRONIC NOISE ON THESE INTENSIFIED CAMERAS YOU DON'T SEE LUMINESCENCE UNTIL THE SUBMERSIBLE BEGINS TO MOVE FORWARD THROUGH THE WATER BUT AS IT DOES ANIMALS BUMPING INTO THE SCREEN ARE STIMULATED TO BIOLUMINESC
EWidder_2010Z NOW WHEN I WAS FIRST DOING THIS ALL I WAS TRYING TO DO WAS COUNT THE NUMBER OF SOURCES I KNEW MY FORWARD SPEED I KNEW THE AREA SO I COULD FIGURE OUT HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF SOURCES THERE WERE PER CUBIC METER BUT I STARTED TO REALIZE THAT I COULD ACTUALLY IDENTIFY ANIMALS BY THE TYPE OF FLASHES THEY PRODUCED
EWidder_2010Z AND SO HERE IN THE GULF OF MAINE AT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET I CAN NAME PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING YOU'RE SEEING THERE TO THE SPECIES LEVEL LIKE THOSE BIG EXPLOSIONS
EWidder_2010Z SPARKS ARE FROM A LITTLE COMB JELLY AND THERE'S KRILL AND OTHER KINDS OF CRUSTACEANS AND JELLYFISH THERE WAS ONE OF THOSE COMB JELLIES
EWidder_2010Z AND SO I'VE WORKED WITH COMPUTER IMAGE ANALYSIS ENGINEERS TO DEVELOP AUTOMATIC RECOGNITION SYSTEMS
EWidder_2010Z CAN IDENTIFY THESE ANIMALS AND THEN EXTRACT THE X Y Z COORDINATE OF THE INITIAL IMPACT POINT AND WE CAN THEN DO THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ECOLOGISTS DO ON LAND AND DO NEAREST NEIGHBOR DISTANCES
EWidder_2010Z AND THIS ISN'T SOMEPLACE EXOTIC LIKE ONE OF THE BIOLUMINESCENT BAYS IN PUERTO RICO THIS WAS ACTUALLY SHOT IN SAN DIEGO HARBOR
EWidder_2010Z SO HOW DOES A LIVING CREATURE MAKE LIGHT WELL THAT WAS THE QUESTION NINETEENTH CENTURY FRENCH PHYSIOLOGIST RAPHAEL DUBOIS ASKED ABOUT THIS BIOLUMINESCENT CLAM
EWidder_2010Z MANAGED TO GET OUT A COUPLE OF CHEMICALS ONE THE ENZYME HE CALLED LUCIFERASE THE SUBSTRATE HE CALLED
EWidder_2010Z AFTER LUCIFER THE LIGHT BEARER THAT TERMINOLOGY HAS STUCK BUT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY REFER TO SPECIFIC CHEMICALS BECAUSE THESE CHEMICALS COME IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT SHAPES AND FORMS
EWidder_2010Z IN FACT MOST OF THE PEOPLE STUDYING BIOLUMINESCENCE TODAY ARE FOCUSED ON THE CHEMISTRY BECAUSE THESE CHEMICALS HAVE PROVED SO INCREDIBLY VALUABLE FOR DEVELOPING ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS CANCER FIGHTING DRUGS
EWidder_2010Z NOBEL PRIZE IN CHEMISTRY WAS AWARDED FOR WORK DONE ON A MOLECULE CALLED GREEN FLORESCENT PROTEIN THAT WAS ISOLATED FROM THE BIOLUMINESCENT CHEMISTRY OF A JELLYFISH
EWidder_2010Z AND IT'S BEEN EQUATED TO THE INVENTION OF THE MICROSCOPE IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS HAD ON CELL BIOLOGY AND GENETIC ENGINEERING
EWidder_2010Z WELL FOR ANIMALS THAT ARE TRYING TO AVOID PREDATORS BY STAYING IN THE DARKNESS LIGHT CAN STILL BE VERY USEFUL FOR THE THREE BASIC THINGS ANIMALS HAVE TO DO TO SURVIVE
EWidder_2010Z AND THAT'S FIND FOOD ATTRACT A MATE AND AVOID BEING EATEN SO FOR EXAMPLE THIS FISH HAS A BUILT IN HEADLIGHT BEHIND ITS EYE THAT IT CAN USE FOR FINDING FOOD
EWidder_2010Z OR ATTRACTING A MATE AND THEN WHEN IT'S NOT USING IT IT ACTUALLY CAN ROLL IT DOWN IN ITS HEAD JUST LIKE THE HEADLIGHTS ON YOUR LAMBORGHINI
EWidder_2010Z THIS FISH ACTUALLY HAS HIGH BEAMS AND THIS FISH WHICH IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES HAS THREE HEADLIGHTS ON EACH SIDE OF ITS HEAD
EWidder_2010Z NOW THIS ONE IS BLUE
EWidder_2010Z THE COLOR OF MOST BIOLUMINESCENCE IN THE OCEAN BECAUSE EVOLUTION HAS SELECTED FOR THE COLOR THAT TRAVELS FARTHEST THROUGH SEAWATER IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE COMMUNICATION
EWidder_2010Z SO MOST ANIMALS MAKE BLUE LIGHT AND MOST ANIMALS CAN ONLY SEE BLUE LIGHT BUT THIS FISH IS A REALLY FASCINATING EXCEPTION BECAUSE IT HAS TWO RED LIGHT ORGANS
EWidder_2010Z AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THERE'S TWO AND THAT'S SOMETHING I WANT TO SOLVE SOME DAY SO NOT ONLY CAN IT SEE BLUE LIGHT BUT IT CAN SEE RED LIGHT
EWidder_2010Z SO IT USES ITS RED BIOLUMINESCENCE LIKE A SNIPER 'S SCOPE TO BE ABLE TO SNEAK UP ON ANIMALS THAT ARE BLIND TO RED LIGHT AND WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THEM WITHOUT BEING SEEN
EWidder_2010Z IT'S ALSO GOT A LITTLE CHIN BARBLE HERE WITH A BLUE LUMINESCENT LURE ON IT THAT IT CAN USE TO ATTRACT PREY FROM A LONG WAY OFF AND A LOT OF ANIMALS WILL USE THEIR BIOLUMINESCENCE AS A LURE
EWidder_2010Z THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVORITE FISH THIS IS A VIPERFISH AND IT'S GOT A LURE ON THE END OF A LONG FISHING ROD THAT IT ARCHES IN FRONT OF THE TOOTHY JAW THAT GIVES THE VIPERFISH ITS NAME
EWidder_2010Z THE TEETH ON THIS FISH ARE SO LONG THAT IF THEY CLOSED INSIDE THE MOUTH OF THE FISH IT WOULD ACTUALLY IMPALE ITS OWN BRAIN
EWidder_2010Z SO INSTEAD IT SLIDES IN GROOVES ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE HEAD THIS IS A CHRISTMAS TREE OF A FISH EVERYTHING ON THIS FISH LIGHTS UP IT'S NOT JUST
EWidder_2010Z THAT LURE IT'S GOT BUILT IN FLASHLIGHT IT'S GOT THESE JEWEL LIKE LIGHT ORGANS ON ITS BELLY THAT IT USES FOR A TYPE OF CAMOUFLAGE THAT
EWidder_2010Z SHADOW SO WHEN IT'S SWIMMING AROUND AND THERE'S A PREDATOR LOOKING UP FROM BELOW IT MAKES ITSELF DISAPPEAR
EWidder_2010Z AND WE KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT BIOLUMINESCENCE THANKS TO PIXAR AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO PIXAR FOR SHARING MY FAVORITE TOPIC WITH SO MANY PEOPLE I DO WISH WITH THEIR BUDGET THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE SPENT JUST A TINY BIT MORE MONEY
EWidder_2010Z TO PAY A CONSULTING FEE TO SOME POOR STARVING GRADUATE STUDENT WHO COULD HAVE TOLD THEM THAT THOSE ARE THE EYES OF A FISH THAT'S BEEN PRESERVED IN FORMALIN
EWidder_2010Z THESE ARE THE EYES OF A LIVING ANGLER FISH SO SHE'S GOT A LURE THAT SHE STICKS OUT IN FRONT OF THIS LIVING MOUSETRAP OF NEEDLE SHARP TEETH IN ORDER TO ATTRACT IN SOME UNSUSPECTING PREY
EWidder_2010Z THIS ONE HAS A LURE WITH ALL KINDS OF INTERESTING THREADS COMING OFF IT NOW WE USED TO THINK THAT THE DIFFERENT SHAPE OF THE LURE WAS
EWidder_2010Z TO ATTRACT DIFFERENT TYPES OF PREY BUT THEN STOMACH CONTENT ANALYSIS ON THESE FISH DONE BY SCIENTISTS OR MORE LIKELY THEIR GRADUATE STUDENTS
EWidder_2010Z HAVE REVEALED THAT THEY ALL EAT PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING SO NOW WE BELIEVE THAT THE DIFFERENT SHAPE OF THE LURE IS HOW THE MALE RECOGNIZES THE FEMALE IN THE ANGLER FISH WORLD BECAUSE MANY OF THESE MALES ARE WHAT ARE KNOWN AS DWARF MALES
EWidder_2010Z THIS LITTLE GUY HAS NO VISIBLE MEANS OF SELF SUPPORT
EWidder_2010Z HE HAS NO LURE FOR ATTRACTING FOOD AND NO TEETH FOR EATING IT WHEN IT GETS THERE HIS ONLY HOPE FOR EXISTENCE ON THIS PLANET IS AS A GIGOLO
EWidder_2010Z HE 'S GOT TO FIND HIMSELF A BABE AND THEN HE 'S GOT TO LATCH ON FOR LIFE
EWidder_2010Z SO THIS LITTLE GUY
EWidder_2010Z HAS FOUND HIMSELF THIS BABE AND YOU WILL NOTE THAT HE 'S HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO ATTACH HIMSELF IN A WAY THAT HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT HER
EWidder_2010Z BUT HER STILL KNOWS A GOOD THING WHEN HE SEES IT AND SO HE SEALS THE RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ETERNAL KISS
EWidder_2010Z HIS FLESH FUSES WITH HER FLESH HER BLOODSTREAM GROWS INTO HIS BODY AND HE BECOMES NOTHING MORE THAN A LITTLE SPERM SAC
EWidder_2010Z WELL THIS IS A DEEP SEA VERSION OF WOMEN 'S LIB SHE ALWAYS KNOWS WHERE HE IS AND SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE MONOGAMOUS BECAUSE SOME OF THESE FEMALES COME UP WITH MULTIPLE MALES ATTACHED
EWidder_2010Z SO THEY CAN USE IT FOR FINDING FOOD FOR ATTRACTING MATES THEY USE IT A LOT FOR DEFENSE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS A LOT OF THEM CAN RELEASE THEIR LUCIFERIN THEIR LUFERASE IN THE WATER JUST LIKE A SQUID OR AN OCTOPUS WILL RELEASE AN INK CLOUD THIS SHRIMP IS ACTUALLY
EWidder_2010Z THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT CRUSTACEANS THERE'S EVEN FISH THAT CAN DO THIS THIS FISH IS CALLED THE SHINING TUBESHOULDER BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY HAS A TUBE ON ITS SHOULDER THAT CAN SQUIRT OUT LIGHT
EWidder_2010Z LUCK ENOUGH TO CAPTURE ONE OF THESE WHEN WE WERE ON A TRAWLING EXPEDITION OFF THE NORTHWEST COAST OF AFRICA FOR BLUE PLANET FOR THE DEEP PORTION OF BLUE PLANET AND WE WERE USING A SPECIAL TRAWLING NET THAT
EWidder_2010Z WE WERE ABLE TO BRING THESE ANIMALS UP ALIVE SO WE CAPTURED ONE OF THESE AND I BROUGHT IT INTO THE LAB SO I'M HOLDING IT AND I'M ABOUT TO TOUCH THAT TUBE ON ITS SHOULDER AND WHEN I DO YOU'LL SEE BIOLUMINESCENCE COMING OUT BUT
EWidder_2010Z TO ME WHAT'S SHOCKING IS NOT JUST THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT BUT THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT JUST LUCIFERIN AND LUCIFERATES
EWidder_2010Z NOW ANOTHER FORM OF DEFENSE IS SOMETHING CALLED A BURGLAR ALARM SAME REASON YOU HAVE A BURGLAR ALARM ON YOUR CAR THE HONKING HORN AND FLASHING LIGHTS ARE MEANT TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF HOPEFULLY THE POLICE THAT WILL COME AND TAKE THE BURGLAR AWAY
EWidder_2010Z WHEN AN ANIMAL 'S CAUGHT IN THE CLUTCHES OF A PREDATOR ITS ONLY HOPE FOR ESCAPE MAY BE TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF SOMETHING BIGGER AND NASTIER THAT WILL ATTACK THEIR ATTACKER THEREBY AFFORDING THEM A CHANCE FOR ESCAPE THIS JELLYFISH FOR EXAMPLE HAS A SPECTACULAR BIOLUMINESCENT DISPLAY
EWidder_2010Z THIS IS US CHASING IT IN THE SUBMERSIBLE THAT'S NOT LUMINESCENCE THAT'S REFLECTED LIGHT FROM THE GONADS WE CAPTURE IT IN A VERY SPECIAL DEVICE ON THE FRONT OF THE SUBMERSIBLE THAT ALLOWS US TO BRING IT UP IN REALLY PRISTINE CONDITION
EWidder_2010Z IS AN UNBELIEVABLY LIGHT SHOW IT'S THIS PINWHEEL OF LIGHT AND I'VE DONE CALCULATIONS THAT SHOW THAT THIS COULD BE SEE FROM AS MUCH AS THREE HUNDRED FEET AWAY BY A PREDATOR AND I THOUGHT YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE A PRETTY GOOD LURE
EWidder_2010Z BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S FRUSTRATED ME AS A DEEP SEA EXPLORER IS HOW MANY ANIMALS THERE PROBABLY ARE IN THE OCEAN THAT WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT
EWidder_2010Z BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE EXPLORE THE OCEAN THE PRIMARY WAY THAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT LIVES IN THE OCEAN IS WE GO OUT AND DRAG NETS BEHIND SHIPS
EWidder_2010Z AND I DEFY YOU TO NAME ANY OTHER BRANCH OF SCIENCE THAT STILL DEPENDS ON HUNDREDS OF YEAR OLD TECHNOLOGY
EWidder_2010Z THE OTHER PRIMARY WAY IS WE GO DOWN WITH SUBMERSIBLES AND REMOTE OPERATED VEHICLES I'VE MADE HUNDREDS OF DIVES IN SUBMERSIBLES WHEN I'M SITTING IN A SUBMERSIBLE
EWidder_2010Z I KNOW THAT I'M NOT UNOBTRUSIVE AT ALL I'VE GOT BRIGHT LIGHTS AND NOISY THRUSTERS ANY ANIMAL WITH ANY SENSE IS GOING TO BE LONG GONE
EWidder_2010Z SO I'VE WANTED FOR A LONG TIME TO FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT WAY TO EXPLORE AND SO SOMETIME AGO I GOT THIS IDEA FOR A CAMERA SYSTEM IT'S NOT EXACTLY ROCKET SCIENCE WE CALL THIS THING EYE IN THE SEA
EWidder_2010Z AND SCIENTISTS HAVE DONE THIS ON LAND FOR YEARS WE JUST USE A COLOR THAT THE ANIMALS CAN'T SEE AND THEN A CAMERA THAT CAN SEE THAT COLOR
EWidder_2010Z YOU CAN'T USE INFRARED IN THE SEA WE USED FAR RED LIGHT BUT EVEN THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT GETS ABSORBED SO QUICKLY MADE AN INTENSIFIED CAMERA WANTED TO MAKE THIS ELECTRONIC JELLYFISH THING IS IN SCIENCE
EWidder_2010Z YOU HAVE TO TELL THE FUNDING AGENCIES WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DISCOVER BEFORE THEY'LL GIVE YOU THE MONEY AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING TO DISCOVER SO I COULDN'T GET THE FUNDING FOR THIS SO
EWidder_2010Z I KLUGED THIS TOGETHER I GOT THE HARVEY MUDD ENGINEERING CLINIC TO ACTUALLY DO IT AS AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT PROJECT INITIALLY AND THEN I KLUGED
EWidder_2010Z SO THAT I COULD TEST IT AND WE COULD FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE WHICH COLORS OF RED LIGHT WE HAD TO USE SO THAT WE COULD SEE THE ANIMALS BUT THEY COULDN'T SEE
EWidder_2010Z GET THE ELECTRONIC JELLYFISH WORKING AND YOU CAN SEE JUST WHAT A SHOESTRING OPERATION THIS REALLY WAS BECAUSE WHEN I CAST THESE SIXTEEN BLUE LEDS IN EPOXY AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE EPOXY MOLD WE USED THE WORD ZIPLOC IS STILL VISIBLE
EWidder_2010Z AND REMARKABLY THAT MOMENT GOT CAUGHT ON FILM BY PHOTOGRAPHER MARK RICHARDS WHO HAPPENED TO BE THERE AT THE PRECISE MOMENT THAT WE DISCOVERED THAT IT ALL CAME TOGETHER THAT'S ME ON THE LEFT MY GRADUATE STUDENT AT THE TIME ERICA RAYMOND
EWidder_2010Z AND LEE FRY WHO WAS THE ENGINEER ON THE PROJECT AND WE THIS PHOTOGRAPH POSTED IN OUR LAB IN A PLACE OF HONOR WITH THE CAPTION ENGINEER SATISFYING TWO WOMEN AT ONCE
EWidder_2010Z AND WE WERE VERY VERY HAPPY SO NOW WE HAD A SYSTEM THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY TAKE TO SOME PLACE THAT WAS KIND OF LIKE AN OASIS ON THE BOTTOM OFF THE OCEAN THAT MIGHT BE PATROLLED BY LARGE PREDATORS
EWidder_2010Z AND SO THE PLACE THAT WE TOOK IT TO WAS THIS PLACE CALLED A BRINE POOL WHICH IS IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE GULF OF MEXICO IT'S A MAGICAL PLACE AND I KNOW THIS FOOTAGE ISN'T GOING TO LOOK LIKE ANYTHING TO YOU WE HAD A CRUMMY CAMERA AT THE TIME BUT I WAS ECSTATIC
EWidder_2010Z DOWN THERE DISTURBING THEM IN SOME WAY
EWidder_2010Z FOUR HOURS INTO THE DEPLOYMENT WE HAD PROGRAMMED THE ELECTRONIC JELLYFISH TO COME ON FOR THE FIRST TIME EIGHTY SIX SECONDS AFTER IT WENT INTO ITS PINWHEEL DISPLAY WE RECORDED THIS
EWidder_2010Z THIS IS A SQUID OVER SIX FEET LONG THAT IS SO NEW TO SCIENCE IT CANNOT BE PLACED IN ANY KNOWN SCIENTIFIC FAMILY
EWidder_2010Z I COULD NOT HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER PROOF OF CONCEPT AND BASED ON THIS I WENT BACK TO THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AND SAID THIS IS WHAT WE WILL DISCOVER AND THEY GAVE ME ENOUGH MONEY TO DO IT RIGHT
EWidder_2010Z WHICH HAS INVOLVED DEVELOPING THE WORLD 'S FIRST DEEP SEA WEBCAM WHICH HAS BEEN INSTALLED IN THE MONTEREY CANYON FOR THE PAST YEAR AND NOW MORE RECENTLY A MODULAR FORM OF THIS SYSTEM A MUCH MORE MOBILE FORM
EWidder_2010Z AND FOR ME LEARN MORE ABOUT THE BIOLUMINESCENCE IN THESE HOPE SPOTS SO ONE OF THESE TAKE HOME MESSAGES HERE IS
EWidder_2010Z A THOUSAND TIMES YES AND PLEASE TURN OUT THE LIGHTS I PROMISE YOU'LL LOVE IT THANK YOU
