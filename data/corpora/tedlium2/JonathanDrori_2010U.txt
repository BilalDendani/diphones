JonathanDrori_2010U@16.86:29.99 I HAVE TWO MISSIONS HERE TODAY THE FIRST IS TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT POLLEN I HOPE AND TO CONVINCE YOU THAT IT 'S MORE THAN JUST SOMETHING THAT GETS UP YOUR NOSE AND SECONDLY TO CONVINCE YOU THAT EVERY HOME REALLY OUGHT TO HAVE A SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE
JonathanDrori_2010U@51.48:60.15 POLLEN IS PRODUCED BY THE ANTHERS OF FLOWERS EACH ANTHER CAN CARRY UP TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND GRAINS OF POLLEN
JonathanDrori_2010U@60.15:70.38 SO IT 'S QUITE PROLIFIC STUFF AND IT ISN 'T JUST BRIGHT FLOWERS THAT HAVE POLLEN IT 'S ALSO TREES AND GRASSES AND REMEMBER THAT ALL OUR CEREAL CROPS ARE GRASSES AS WELL
JonathanDrori_2010U@109.75:124.77 THIS IS AMAZING I THINK THAT LITTLE HOLE IN THE MIDDLE THERE IS FOR THE POLLEN TUBE AND WHEN THE POLLEN FINDS ITS SPECIAL FEMALE SPOT IN ANOTHER MORINA FLOWER JUST ON THE RIGHT SPECIES WHAT HAPPENS LIKE I SAID POLLEN CARRIES THE MALE SEX CELLS
JonathanDrori_2010U@128.11:132.25 THEY HAVE RAMPANT PROMISCUOUS AND REALLY QUITE INTERESTING AND CURIOUS SEX REALLY
JonathanDrori_2010U@149.94:168.28 POLLEN FROM PLANTS WHICH ARE WIND DISPERSED LIKE TREES AND GRASSES AND SO ON TEND TO CAUSE THE MOST HAY FEVER AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THEY 'VE GOT TO CHUCK OUT MASSES AND MASSES OF POLLEN TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF THE POLLEN REACHING ANOTHER PLANT OF THE SAME SPECIES HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES THEY 'RE VERY SMOOTH IF YOU LOOK AT THEM
JonathanDrori_2010U@168.29:172.91 OF TREE POLLEN THAT IS MEANT TO BE CARRIED BY THE WIND
JonathanDrori_2010U@183:193.55 THIS ONE I PARTICULARLY LIKE THIS IS THE MONTEREY PINE WHICH HAS LITTLE AIR SACKS TO MAKE THE POLLEN CARRY EVEN FURTHER REMEMBER THAT THING IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY MICROMETERS ACROSS
JonathanDrori_2010U@194.09:204 NOW IT 'S MUCH MORE EFFICIENT IF YOU CAN GET INSECTS TO DO YOUR BIDDING THIS IS A BEE 'S LEG WITH THE POLLEN GLOMMED ONTO IT FROM A MALLOW PLANT
JonathanDrori_2010U@204:216.26 AND THIS IS THE OUTRAGEOUS AND BEAUTIFUL FLOWER OF THE MANGROVE PALM VERY SHOWY TO ATTRACT LOTS OF INSECTS TO DO ITS BIDDING THE POLLEN HAS LITTLE BARBS ON IT IF WE LOOK
JonathanDrori_2010U@227.53:239.7 THAT TELLS ME THAT IT 'S ACTUALLY BEEN FOSSILIZED THIS POLLEN AND I 'M RATHER PROUD TO SAY THAT THIS WAS FOUND JUST NEAR LONDON AND THAT FIFTY FIVE MILLION YEARS AGO LONDON WAS FULL OF MANGROVES ISN 'T THAT COOL
JonathanDrori_2010U@249.79:264.61 ALL THESE PICTURES WERE TAKEN WITH A SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE ACTUALLY IN THE LAB AT KEW LABORATORIES NO COINCIDENCE THAT THESE WERE TAKEN BY ROB KESSELER WHO IS AN ARTIST AND I THINK IT 'S SOMEONE WITH A DESIGN AND ARTISTIC EYE LIKE HIM THAT HAS MANAGED TO BRING OUT THE BEST IN POLLEN
JonathanDrori_2010U@267.59:286.44 ALL THIS DIVERSITY MEANS THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT A POLLEN GRAIN AND TELL WHAT SPECIES IT CAME FROM AND THAT 'S ACTUALLY QUITE HANDY IF YOU MAYBE HAVE A SAMPLE AND YOU WANT TO SEE WHERE IT CAME FROM SO DIFFERENT SPECIES OF PLANTS GROW IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND SOME POLLEN CARRIES FURTHER THAN OTHERS
JonathanDrori_2010U@286.5:300.41 SO IF YOU HAVE A POLLEN SAMPLE THEN IN PRINCIPLE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL WHERE THAT SAMPLE CAME FROM AND THIS IS WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING FOR FORENSICS POLLEN IS TINY
JonathanDrori_2010U@300.57:314.86 IT GETS ON TO THINGS AND IT STICKS TO THEM SO NOT ONLY DOES EACH TYPE OF POLLEN LOOK DIFFERENT BUT EACH HABITAT HAS A DIFFERENT COMBINATION OF PLANTS A DIFFERENT POLLEN SIGNATURE IF YOU LIKE OR A DIFFERENT POLLEN FINGERPRINT
JonathanDrori_2010U@314.86:324.55 BY LOOKING AT THE PROPORTIONS AND COMBINATIONS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF POLLEN IN A SAMPLE YOU CAN TELL VERY PRECISELY WHERE IT CAME FROM
JonathanDrori_2010U@336.59:348.24 FOUR VERY DIFFERENT HABITATS MIGHT LOOK SIMILAR BUT THEY 'VE GOT VERY DIFFERENT POLLEN SIGNATURES ACTUALLY THIS ONE IS PARTICULARLY EASY THESE PICTURES WERE ALL TAKEN IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES BUT POLLEN FORENSICS CAN BE VERY SUBTLE
JonathanDrori_2010U@348.37:361.63 IT 'S BEING USED NOW TO TRACK WHERE COUNTERFEIT DRUGS HAVE BEEN MADE WHERE BANKNOTES HAVE COME FROM TO LOOK AT THE PROVENANCE OF ANTIQUES AND SEE THAT THEY REALLY DID COME FROM THE PLACE THE SELLER SAID THEY DID
JonathanDrori_2010U@361.63:377.64 AND MURDER SUSPECTS HAVE BEEN TRACKED USING THEIR CLOTHING CERTAINLY IN THE U K TO WITHIN AN AREA THAT 'S SMALL ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN SEND IN TRACKER DOGS TO FIND THE MURDER VICTIM SO YOU CAN TELL FROM A PIECE OF CLOTHING TO WITHIN ABOUT
JonathanDrori_2010U@377.64:383.48 A KILOMETER OR SO WHERE THAT PIECE OF CLOTHING HAS BEEN RECENTLY AND THEN SEND IN DOGS
JonathanDrori_2010U@383.48:399.35 AND FINALLY IN A RATHER GRIZZLY WAY THE BOSNIA WAR CRIMES SOME OF THE PEOPLE BROUGHT TO TRIAL WERE BROUGHT TO TRIAL BECAUSE OF THE EVIDENCE FROM POLLEN WHICH SHOWED THAT BODIES HAD BEEN BURIED EXHUMED AND THEN REBURIED SOMEWHERE ELSE
JonathanDrori_2010U@401.53:413.55 I HOPE I 'VE OPENED YOUR EYES IF YOU 'LL EXCUSE THE VISUAL PUN LAUGHTER TO SOME OF POLLEN 'S SECRETS THIS IS A HORSE CHESTNUT THERE IS AN INVISIBLE BEAUTY ALL AROUND US EACH GRAIN WITH A STORY TO TELL
JonathanDrori_2010U@413.55:422.63 EACH OF US IN FACT WITH A STORY TO TELL FROM THE POLLEN FINGERPRINT THAT 'S UPON US THANK YOU TO THE COLLEAGUES AT KEW AND THANK YOU TO PALYNOLOGISTS EVERYWHERE
