JJAbrams_2007@317.40:320.42 IS THAT IT REPRESENTS INFINITE POSSIBILITY
JJAbrams_2007@332.58:334.41 FIND MYSELF DRAWN TO
JJAbrams_2007@372.47:381.54 THAT SENSE OF POSSIBILITY WHAT COULD THIS THING BE THERE WAS NO TIME TO DEVELOP IT I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THOSE PEOPLE WHO TELL YOU WHAT YOU CAN'T DO AND WHAT YOU SHOULD CHANGE AND THERE WAS NO TIME FOR THAT WHICH IS KIND OF AMAZING
JJAbrams_2007@382.20:390.93 AND SO WE DID THIS SHOW AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO YOU KNOW WHO HAVEN'T SEEN IT OR DON'T KNOW IT I CAN SHOW YOU THIS ONE LITTLE CLIP FROM THE PILOT JUST TO SHOW YOU SOME
JJAbrams_2007@444.07:446.17 TEN YEARS AGO IF WE WANTED TO DO THAT WE'D HAVE TO KILL

JJAbrams_2007@468.77:478.64 WE DID AND SO PART OF THE AMAZING THING FOR ME IS IN THE CREATIVE PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IS LIKE MIND BLOWINGLY INSPIRING TO ME I REALIZE THAT THAT BLANK PAGE IS A MAGIC BOX

JJAbrams_2007@511.74:525.27 IN TERMS OF THE CONTENT OF IT YOU LOOK AT STORIES YOU THINK WELL WHAT ARE STORIES BUT MYSTERY BOXES THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IN TV THE FIRST ACT IS CALLED THE TEASER IT'S LITERALLY THE TEASER IT'S THE BIG QUESTION SO YOU'RE DRAWN INTO IT THEN OF COURSE THERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION AND IT GOES ON
JJAbrams_2007@552.04:557.41 WITH MYSTERY BOXES THAT I STARTED FEELING LIKE COMPELLED THEN THERE'S THE THING OF LIKE MYSTERY IN TERMS OF IMAGINATION
JJAbrams_2007@559.13:562.94 THE WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION YOU KNOW DOING THAT INTENTIONALLY
JJAbrams_2007@563.26:574.20 IS MUCH MORE ENGAGING WHETHER IT'S LIKE THE SHARK IN JAWS IF SPIELBERG 'S MECHANICAL SHARK BRUCE HAD WORKED IT WOULD NOT BE REMOTELY AS SCARY YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN IT TOO MUCH IN ALIEN THEY NEVER REALLY SHOWED THE ALIEN TERRIFYING
JJAbrams_2007@574.91:582.17 EVEN IN A MOVIE LIKE A ROMANTIC COMEDY THE GRADUATE THEY'RE HAVING THAT DATE REMEMBER AND THEY'RE IN THE CAR AND IT'S LOUD AND SO THEY PUT THE TOP UP
JJAbrams_2007@592.74:596.68 THIS IDEA STRETCHING THE SORT OF PARADIGM A LITTLE BIT BUT THE IDEA OF
JJAbrams_2007@608.50:619.11 RIGHT WELL IT'S NOT E T IS ABOUT DIVORCE E T IS ABOUT A HEARTBROKEN DIVORCE CRIPPLED FAMILY AND ULTIMATELY THIS KID WHO CAN'T FIND HIS WAY DIE HARD RIGHT CRAZY GREAT FUN ACTION ADVENTURE MOVIE IN A BUILDING
JJAbrams_2007@619.57:628.15 IT'S ABOUT A GUY WHO 'S ON THE VERGE OF DIVORCE HE 'S SHOWING UP TO LA TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS THERE ARE GREAT SCENES MAYBE NOT THE MOST AMAZING DRAMATIC SCENES IN THE HISTORY OF TIME BUT
JJAbrams_2007@644.49:644.67 AND
JJAbrams_2007@650.09:651.61 DEALING WITH HIS PLACE IN THE WORLD

JJAbrams_2007@743.90:752.66 IT'S WHY WHEN PEOPLE LIKE DO SEQUELS OR RIP OFF MOVIES YOU KNOW OF A GENRE THEY'RE RIPPING OFF THE WRONG THING YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO RIP OFF THE SHARK OR THE MONSTER YOU GOTTA RIP OFF YOU KNOW IF YOU

JJAbrams_2007@826.70:836.89 GUYS WHO HAD SOME VISUAL EFFECTS EXPERIENCE BUT THE POINT WAS THAT THEY WERE DOING THINGS THAT WERE USING THESE MYSTERY BOXES THAT THEY HAD EVERYONE HAS NOW WHAT I REALIZE IS WHAT MY GRANDFATHER DID FOR ME WHEN I WAS A KID
JJAbrams_2007@847.66:856.12 USING INFINITY SOFTWARE THEY STOPPED MAKING FIFTEEN YEARS AGO HE 'S DOING STUFF THAT LOOKS AS AMAZING AS STUFF I'VE SEEN RELEASED FROM HOLLYWOOD
JJAbrams_2007@856.58:865.59 THE MOST INCREDIBLE SORT OF MYSTERY I THINK IS NOW THE QUESTION OF WHAT COMES NEXT BECAUSE IT IS NOW DEMOCRATIZED SO NOW THE CREATION OF MEDIA
JJAbrams_2007@865.96:872.64 IS IT'S EVERYWHERE THE STUFF THAT I WAS LUCKY AND BEGGING FOR TO GET WHEN I WAS A KID IS NOW UBIQUITOUS AND SO THERE'S AN AMAZING SENSE

JJAbrams_2007@955.83:968.42 SO MY FAVORITE VISUAL EFFECT IN THE MOVIE IS THE ONE I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU AND IT'S A SCENE IN WHICH TOM 'S CHARACTER WAKES UP HE 'S DROWSY HE 'S CRAZY OUT OF IT AND THE GUY WAKES UP AND HE SHOVES THIS GUN IN HIS NOSE AND SHOOTS THIS LITTLE CAPSULE INTO HIS BRAIN THAT HE 'S GOING TO USE LATER TO KILL HIM AS BAD GUYS
