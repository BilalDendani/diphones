KateHartman_2011@22.65:34.63 AND I LIKE TO MAKE DEVICES THAT PLAY WITH THE WAYS THAT WE RELATE AND COMMUNICATE SO I 'M SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED IN HOW WE AS HUMANS RELATE TO OURSELVES EACH OTHER AND THE WORLD AROUND US
KateHartman_2011@80.57:87.75 DON 'T BE ASHAMED IT 'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE IN COMMON AND THEY ACT AS OUR PRIMARY INTERFACES FOR THE WORLD
KateHartman_2011@123.36:139.12 AND I TEND TO BE A PERSON WHO THINKS TOO MUCH AND TALKS TOO LITTLE AND SO I WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW IT MIGHT BE GREAT IF I COULD JUST TAKE ALL THESE NOISES LIKE ALL THESE SOUNDS OF MY THOUGHTS IN MY HEAD IF I COULD JUST PHYSICALLY EXTRICATE THEM AND PULL THEM OUT IN SUCH A FORM THAT I COULD SHARE THEM WITH SOMEBODY ELSE
KateHartman_2011@139.12:154.08 AND SO I WENT HOME AND I MADE A PROTOTYPE OF THIS HAT AND I CALLED IT THE MUTTERING HAT BECAUSE IT EMITTED THESE MUTTERING NOISES THAT WERE KIND OF TETHERED TO YOU BUT YOU COULD DETACH THEM AND SHARE THEM WITH SOMEBODY ELSE
KateHartman_2011@201.14:216.14 SO MANY OF THESE DEVICES REALLY KIND OF FOCUS ON THE WAYS IN WHICH WE RELATE TO OURSELVES SO THIS PARTICULAR DEVICE IS CALLED THE GUT LISTENER AND IT IS A TOOL THAT ACTUALLY ENABLES ONE TO LISTEN TO THEIR OWN INNARDS
KateHartman_2011@290.11:300.3 AND SO WHEN I WAS FIRST LIVING IN NEW YORK CITY A FEW YEARS BACK I WAS THINKING A LOT ABOUT THE FAMILIAR ARCHITECTURAL FORMS THAT SURROUNDED ME AND HOW I WOULD LIKE TO BETTER RELATE TO THEM
KateHartman_2011@300.32:307.02 AND I THOUGHT WELL HEY MAYBE IF I WANT TO BETTER RELATE TO WALLS MAYBE I NEED TO BE MORE WALL LIKE MYSELF
KateHartman_2011@333.35:344.03 SO WHEN A PLANT IS THIRSTY IT CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A PHONE CALL OR POST A MESSAGE TO A SERVICE LIKE TWITTER AND SO THIS REALLY SHIFTS THE HUMAN PLANT DYNAMIC
KateHartman_2011@352.72:360.67 AND SO KIND OF THINKING ABOUT SCALE MY MOST RECENT OBSESSION IS ACTUALLY WITH GLACIERS OF COURSE
KateHartman_2011@376.74:380.95 THEY 'RE BOTH SHRINKING AND RETREATING AND SOME OF THEM HAVE DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER
KateHartman_2011@380.95:385.77 AND SO I ACTUALLY LIVE IN CANADA NOW SO I 'VE BEEN VISITING ONE OF MY LOCAL GLACIERS
KateHartman_2011@385.77:402.87 AND THIS ONE 'S PARTICULARLY INTERESTING BECAUSE OF ALL THE GLACIERS IN NORTH AMERICA IT RECEIVES THE HIGHEST VOLUME OF HUMAN TRAFFIC IN A YEAR THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THESE BUSES THAT DRIVE UP AND OVER THE LATERAL MORAINE AND DROP PEOPLE OFF ON THE SURFACE OF THE GLACIER AND THIS HAS REALLY GOTTEN ME THINKING ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE OF THE INITIAL ENCOUNTER
KateHartman_2011@402.87:405.92 WHEN I MEET A GLACIER FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
KateHartman_2011@477.93:489.44 SO YEA THIS IS ACTUALLY JUST THE BEGINNING THESE ARE INITIAL MUSINGS FOR THIS PROJECT AND JUST AS WITH THE WALL HOW I WANTED TO BE MORE WALL LIKE WITH THIS PROJECT I 'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO TAKE MORE A OF GLACIAL PACE
KateHartman_2011@489.44:508.85 AND SO MY INTENT IS TO ACTUALLY JUST TAKE THE NEXT TEN YEARS AND GO ON A SERIES OF COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS WHERE I WORK WITH PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES ARTISTS TECHNOLOGISTS SCIENTISTS TO KIND OF WORK ON THIS PROJECT OF HOW WE CAN IMPROVE HUMAN GLACIER RELATIONS
KateHartman_2011@509.59:512.22 SO BEYOND THAT IN CLOSING
