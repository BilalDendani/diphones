MishaGlenny_2009G THESE ARE GRIM ECONOMIC TIMES FELLOW TEDSTERS GRIM ECONOMIC TIMES INDEED AND SO
MishaGlenny_2009G I WOULD LIKE TO CHEER YOU UP WITH ONE OF THE GREAT ALBEIT LARGELY UNKNOWN COMMERCIAL SUCCESS STORIES OF THE PAST TWENTY YEARS
MishaGlenny_2009G I REFER TO ORGANIZED CRIME NOW ORGANIZED CRIME HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A VERY LONG TIME I HEAR YOU SAY AND THESE WOULD BE WISE WORDS INDEED BUT IN THE LAST TWO DECADES
MishaGlenny_2009G IT HAS EXPERIENCED AN UNPRECEDENTED EXPANSION NOW ACCOUNTING FOR ROUGHLY FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE WORLD 'S GDP I LIKE TO CALL IT THE GLOBAL SHADOW ECONOMY OR
MishaGlenny_2009G SO WHAT TRIGGERED THIS EXTRAORDINARY GROWTH IN CROSS BORDER CRIME WELL OF COURSE THERE IS GLOBALIZATION TECHNOLOGY
MishaGlenny_2009G THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM ALL ACROSS EASTERN EUROPE A MOST MOMENTOUS EPISODE IN OUR POST WAR HISTORY NOW IT'S TIME FOR FULL DISCLOSURE
MishaGlenny_2009G THIS EVENT MEANT A GREAT DEAL TO ME PERSONALLY I HAD STARTED SMUGGLING BOOKS ACROSS THE IRON CURTAIN TO DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION GROUPS IN EASTERN EUROPE
MishaGlenny_2009G LIKE SOLIDARITY IN POLAND WHEN I WAS IN MY TEENS I THEN STARTED WRITING ABOUT EASTERN EUROPE AND EVENTUALLY I BECAME THE BBC 'S CHIEF CORRESPONDENT
MishaGlenny_2009G BUT I WAS ALSO A TOUCH WORRIED ABOUT SOME OF THE NASTIER THINGS LURKING BEHIND THE WALL IT WASN'T LONG FOR EXAMPLE BEFORE ETHNIC NATIONALISM REARED ITS BLOODY HEAD
MishaGlenny_2009G IN EASTERN EUROPE CONTINUED TO DO SO AFTER THE REVOLUTIONS THERE OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE CHARACTERS LIKE THIS
MishaGlenny_2009G BUT THERE WERE ALSO MORE UNEXPECTED PEOPLE WHO PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN WHAT WAS GOING ON IN EASTERN EUROPE LIKE THIS CHARACTER
MishaGlenny_2009G LUXURY AT THE TIME IT MAY COME AS A SURPRISE BUT THEY PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE EMERGENCE OF THE MARKET ECONOMY IN EASTERN EUROPE
MishaGlenny_2009G NOW IN BULGARIA THIS PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN IN BULGARIA WHEN COMMUNISM COLLAPSED ALL OVER EASTERN EUROPE
MishaGlenny_2009G IT WASN'T JUST COMMUNISM IT WAS THE STATE THAT COLLAPSED AS WELL THAT MEANS YOUR POLICE FORCE WASN'T WORKING THE COURT SYSTEM WASN'T FUNCTIONING PROPERLY
MishaGlenny_2009G SO WHAT WAS A BUSINESS MAN IN THE BRAVE NEW WORLD OF EAST EUROPEAN CAPITALISM GOING TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS CONTRACTS
MishaGlenny_2009G WOULD BE HONORED WELL HE WOULD TURN TO PEOPLE WHO WERE CALLED RATHER PROSAICALLY BY SOCIOLOGISTS PRIVATIZED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WE PREFER TO KNOW THEM AS THE MAFIA
MishaGlenny_2009G WHEN YOUR STATE IS COLLAPSING YOUR ECONOMY IS HEADING SOUTH AT A RATE OF KNOTS
MishaGlenny_2009G LAST PEOPLE YOU WANT COMING ON TO THE LABOR MARKET ARE FOURTEEN THOUSAND MEN AND WOMEN WHOSE CHIEF SKILLS ARE SURVEILLANCE ARE SMUGGLING
MishaGlenny_2009G WHEN I WAS WORKING IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES I SPENT MOST OF THE TIME COVERING THE APPALLING CONFLICT
MishaGlenny_2009G IN YUGOSLAVIA AND I COULDN'T HELP NOTICE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE PERPETRATING THE APPALLING ATROCITIES
MishaGlenny_2009G BUT ABOVE ALL ELSE BY TALKING TO THE GANGSTERS THEMSELVES AND THE BALKANS WAS A FABULOUS PLACE TO START WHY
MishaGlenny_2009G WELL OF COURSE THERE WAS THE ISSUE OF LAW AND ORDER COLLAPSING BUT ALSO AS THEY SAY IN THE RETAIL TRADE IT'S LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION
MishaGlenny_2009G HEROIN COCAINE WOMEN BEING TRAFFICKED INTO PROSTITUTION AND PRECIOUS MINERALS AND WHERE WERE THEY HEADING
MishaGlenny_2009G THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH BY NOW WAS BEGINNING TO REAP THE BENEFITS OF GLOBALIZATION TRANSFORMING IT INTO THE MOST AFFLUENT CONSUMER MARKET IN HISTORY EVENTUALLY COMPRISING SOME FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE
MishaGlenny_2009G AND A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY OF THOSE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE LIKE TO SPEND SOME OF THEIR LEISURE TIME AND SPARE CASH
MishaGlenny_2009G SLEEPING WITH PROSTITUTES STICKING FIFTY EURO NOTES UP THEIR NOSE AND EMPLOYING ILLEGAL MIGRANT
MishaGlenny_2009G NOW ORGANIZED CRIME IN A GLOBALIZING WORLD OPERATES IN THE SAME WAY AS ANY OTHER BUSINESS IT HAS ZONES OF PRODUCTION LIKE AFGHANISTAN
MishaGlenny_2009G AND COLUMBIA IT HAS ZONES OF DISTRIBUTION LIKE MEXICO AND THE BALKANS AND THEN OF COURSE
MishaGlenny_2009G IT HAS ZONES OF CONSUMPTION LIKE THE EUROPEAN UNION JAPAN AND OF COURSE THE UNITED STATES
MishaGlenny_2009G THE ZONES OF PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION TEND TO LIE IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD AND THEY ARE OFTEN THREATENED BY APPALLING VIOLENCE AND BLOODSHED
MishaGlenny_2009G TAKE MEXICO FOR EXAMPLE SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE KILLED THERE IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE COCAINE TRADE
MishaGlenny_2009G HAVE DIED THERE IT'S NOT A CONFLICT YOU READ ABOUT MUCH IN THE NEWSPAPERS BUT IT'S THE BIGGEST CONFLICT ON THIS PLANET SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND WHY IS IT
MishaGlenny_2009G BECAUSE MAFIAS FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD COOPERATE WITH LOCAL PARAMILITARIES IN ORDER TO SEIZE THE SUPPLIES OF THE RICH MINERAL RESOURCES
MishaGlenny_2009G OF THE REGION IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE WORLD 'S COLTAN WAS SOURCED TO THE KILLING FIELDS OF THE EASTERN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO
MishaGlenny_2009G TO WESTERN MARKETS AND IT IS THIS WESTERN DESIRE TO CONSUME THAT IS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME
MishaGlenny_2009G NOW LET ME SHOW YOU SOME OF MY FRIENDS IN ACTION CAUGHT CONVENIENTLY ON FILM BY THE ITALIAN POLICE AND SMUGGLING DUTY NOT PAID CIGARETTES NOW CIGARETTES OUT THE FACTORY GATE ARE VERY CHEAP THE EUROPEAN UNION
MishaGlenny_2009G THEN IMPOSES THE HIGHEST TAXES ON THEM IN THE WORLD SO IF YOU CAN SMUGGLE THEM INTO THE E U THERE ARE VERY HANDSOME PROFITS TO BE
MishaGlenny_2009G AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS TO DEMONSTRATE THE TYPE OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THESE GROUPS THIS BOAT IS WORTH ONE MILLION EUROS WHEN IT'S NEW AND IT'S THE FASTEST THING
MishaGlenny_2009G MADE THE TRIP ACROSS THE ADRIATIC FROM MONTENEGRO TO ITALY EVERY SINGLE NIGHT AND AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS TRADE BRITAIN ALONE LOST EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE AND INSTEAD
MishaGlenny_2009G TO UNDERWRITE THE WARS IN YUGOSLAVIA AND LINE THE POCKETS OF UNSCRUPULOUS INDIVIDUALS NOW ITALIAN POLICE WHEN THIS TRADE STARTED
MishaGlenny_2009G SOMETIMES THE GANGSTERS WOULD BRING WITH THEM WOMEN BEING TRAFFICKED INTO PROSTITUTION AND IF THE POLICE INTERVENED THEY WOULD HURL THE WOMEN INTO THE SEA
MishaGlenny_2009G SO THAT THE POLICE HAD TO GO AND SAVE THEM FROM DROWNING RATHER THAN CHASING THE BAD GUYS SO I HAVE SHOWN YOU THIS TO DEMONSTRATE
MishaGlenny_2009G HOW MANY BOATS HOW MANY VESSELS IT TAKES TO CATCH ONE OF THESE GUYS AND THE ANSWER IS SIX VESSELS AND REMEMBER TWENTY OF THESE SPEED BOATS
MishaGlenny_2009G COMING ACROSS THE ADRIATIC EVERY SINGLE NIGHT SO WHAT WERE THESE GUYS DOING WITH ALL THE MONEY THEY WERE MAKING WELL
MishaGlenny_2009G THIS IS WHERE WE COME TO GLOBALIZATION BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT JUST THE DEREGULATION OF GLOBAL TRADE IT WAS THE LIBERALIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS
MishaGlenny_2009G DID THAT MAKE IT EASY FOR THE MONEY LAUNDERERS THE LAST TWO DECADES HAVE BEEN THE CHAMPAGNE ERA FOR DIRTY LUCRE
MishaGlenny_2009G IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WE SAW FINANCIAL CENTERS AROUND THE WORLD COMPETING FOR THEIR BUSINESS AND THERE WAS SIMPLY NO EFFECTIVE MECHANISM TO PREVENT MONEY LAUNDERING
MishaGlenny_2009G AND A LOT OF LICIT BANKS WERE ALSO HAPPY TO ACCEPT DEPOSITS FROM VERY DUBIOUS SOURCES
MishaGlenny_2009G THESE THINGS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE MONEY LAUNDERING PARADE AND IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT ILLEGAL TAX EVASION AND TRANSNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME MONEY LAUNDERING YOU HAVE TO GET RID OF THEM
MishaGlenny_2009G ON A POSITIVE NOTE WE AT LAST HAVE SOMEONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO HAS CONSISTENTLY SPOKEN OUT AGAINST THESE CORROSIVE
MishaGlenny_2009G ENTITIES AND IF ANYONE IS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE NECESSITY FOR
MishaGlenny_2009G NEW LEGISLATION REGULATION EFFECTIVE REGULATION I SAY LET 'S TAKE A LOOK AT BERNIE MADOFF
MishaGlenny_2009G TO BE SPENDING THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN JAIL BERNIE MADOFF STOLE SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
MishaGlenny_2009G THAT PUTS HIM UP THERE ON THE OLYMPUS OF GANGSTERS WITH THE COLOMBIAN CARTELS AND THE MAJOR RUSSIAN CRIME SYNDICATES
MishaGlenny_2009G BUT HE DID THIS FOR DECADES IN THE VERY HEART OF WALL STREET AND NO REGULATOR PICKED UP ON IT
MishaGlenny_2009G SO HOW MANY OTHER MADOFFS ARE THERE ON WALL STREET OR IN THE CITY OF LONDON FLEECING ORDINARY FOLK AND MONEY LAUNDERING WELL I CAN TELL YOU IT'S QUITE A FEW OF THEM
MishaGlenny_2009G THIS ONE HOWEVER IS IN CENTRAL BRITISH COLUMBIA WHERE I PHOTOGRAPHED IT IT'S ONE OF THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MOM AND POP GROW OPS
MishaGlenny_2009G IN B C WHICH ENSURE THAT OVER FIVE PERCENT OF THE PROVINCE 'S GDP IS ACCOUNTED FOR BY THIS TRADE NOW I WAS TAKEN
MishaGlenny_2009G BY INSPECTOR BRIAN CANTERA OF THE ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE TO A CAVERNOUS WAREHOUSE EAST OF
MishaGlenny_2009G TO SEE SOME OF THE GOODS WHICH ARE REGULARLY CONFISCATED BY THE RCMP FROM THE SMUGGLERS WHO ARE SENDING IT OF COURSE DOWN SOUTH TO THE UNITED STATES
MishaGlenny_2009G IS AN INSATIABLE MARKET FOR B C BUD AS IT'S CALLED IN PART BECAUSE IT'S MARKETED AS ORGANIC WHICH OF COURSE GOES DOWN VERY WELL IN CALIFORNIA
MishaGlenny_2009G EVEN BY THE POLICE 'S ASMISSION THIS MAKES NOT A DENT IN THE PROFITS REALLY OF THE MAJOR EXPORTERS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF GLOBALIZATION THE GLOBAL NARCOTICS MARKET HAS EXPANDED
MishaGlenny_2009G THIS HOWEVER MAY ALL BE ABOUT TO CHANGE BECAUSE SOMETHING VERY STRANGE IS GOING ON THE UNITED NATIONS RECOGNIZED EARLIER THIS
MishaGlenny_2009G ACTUALLY THAT CANADA HAS BECOME A KEY AREA OF DISTRIBUTION AND PRODUCTION OF ECSTASY AND OTHER SYNTHETIC DRUGS
MishaGlenny_2009G NOW THAT IS A GAME CHANGER BECAUSE IT SHIFTS PRODUCTION AWAY FROM THE DEVELOPING WORLD AND
MishaGlenny_2009G INTO THE WESTERN WORLD WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT IS A TREND WHICH IS SET TO OVERWHELM OUR POLICING CAPACITY
MishaGlenny_2009G THE DRUGS POLICY WHICH WE'VE HAD IN PLACE FOR FORTY YEARS IS LONG OVERDUE FOR A VERY SERIOUS RETHINK IN MY OPINION
MishaGlenny_2009G NOW THE RECESSION WELL ORGANIZED CRIME HAS ALREADY ADAPTED VERY WELL TO THE RECESSION NOT SURPRISING THE MOST OPPORTUNISTIC INDUSTRY IN THE WHOLE WORLD AND
MishaGlenny_2009G IT HAS NO RULES TO ITS REGULATORY SYSTEM EXCEPT OF COURSE IT HAS TWO BUSINESS RISKS ARREST BY LAW ENFORCEMENT WHICH IS FRANKLY THE LEAST OF THEIR WORRIES AND
MishaGlenny_2009G DURING A RECESSION AND SO INSTEAD THEY HAVE INVADED FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE CRIME IN A BIG WAY BUT ABOVE ALL TWO SECTORS AND THAT IS COUNTERFEIT GOODS AND CYBERCRIME AND ITS BEEN TERRIBLY SUCCESSFUL
MishaGlenny_2009G IT'S REALLY NOT THAT DIFFICULT AND IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH EASIER BECAUSE THE FASCINATING THING ABOUT CYBERCRIME IS THAT
MishaGlenny_2009G IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE TECHNOLOGY THE KEY TO CYBERCRIME IS WHAT WE CALL SOCIAL ENGINEERING OR TO USE THE TECHNICAL TERM FOR IT THERE'S ONE BORN EVERY MINUTE
MishaGlenny_2009G YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE HOW EASY IT IS TO PERSUADE PEOPLE TO DO THINGS WITH THEIR COMPUTERS
MishaGlenny_2009G WHICH ARE OBJECTIVELY NOT IN THEIR INTEREST AND IT WAS VERY SOON WHEN THE CYBERCRIMINALS LEARNED THAT THE QUICKEST WAY TO DO THIS OF COURSE
MishaGlenny_2009G THE QUICKEST WAY TO A PERSON 'S WALLET IS THROUGH THE PROMISE SEX AND LOVE I EXPECT SOME OF YOU REMEMBER THE I LOVE YOU VIRUS ONE OF
MishaGlenny_2009G GREAT WORLDWIDE VIRUSES THAT CAME I WAS VERY FORTUNATE WHEN THE ILOVEYOU VIRUS CAME OUT BECAUSE
MishaGlenny_2009G THE FIRST PERSON I RECEIVED IT FROM WAS AN EX GIRLFRIEND OF MINE NOW SHE HARBORED ALL SORTS OF SENTIMENTS AND EMOTIONS TOWARDS ME AT THE TIME BUT LOVE WAS NOT AMONGST THEM
MishaGlenny_2009G AND SO AS SOON AS I SAW THIS DROP INTO MY INBOX I DISPATCHED IT HASTILY TO THE RECYCLE BIN AND SPARED MYSELF A VERY NASTY INFECTION
MishaGlenny_2009G SO CYBERCRIME DO WATCH OUT FOR IT ONE THING THAT WE DO KNOW THAT THE INTERNET IS DOING IS THE INTERNET IS ASSISTING THESE GUYS
MishaGlenny_2009G THESE ARE MOSQUITOS WHO CARRY THE MALARIAL PARASITE WHICH INFESTS OUR BLOOD WHEN THE MOSY HAS HAD A FREE MEAL AT OUR EXPENSE NOW ARTESUNATE IS A VERY EFFECTIVE DRUG AT
MishaGlenny_2009G WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE MALARIAL PARASITE IS DEVELOPING A RESISTANCE AND THEY FEAR THAT THE REASON IT'S DEVELOPING
MishaGlenny_2009G A RESISTANCE IS BECAUSE CAMBODIANS CAN'T AFFORD THE DRUGS ON THE COMMERCIAL MARKET AND SO THEY BUY IT FROM THE INTERNET
MishaGlenny_2009G AND THESE PILLS CONTAIN ONLY LOW DOSES OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT WHICH IS WHY THINGS ARE THE PARASITE IS BEGINNING TO DEVELOP A RESISTANCE
MishaGlenny_2009G THE REASON I SAY THIS IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO KNOW THAT ORGANIZED CRIME IMPACTS ALL SORTS OF AREAS OF OUR LIVES YOU DON'T HAVE
MishaGlenny_2009G TO SLEEP WITH PROSTITUTES OR TAKE DRUGS IN ORDER TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH ORGANIZED CRIME THEY AFFECT OUR BANK ACCOUNTS THEY AFFECT OUR COMMUNICATIONS OUR PENSION FUNDS
MishaGlenny_2009G THEY EVEN AFFECT THE FOOD THAT WE EAT AND OUR GOVERNMENTS THIS IS NO LONGER
MishaGlenny_2009G ISSUE OF SICILIANS FROM PALERMO AND NEW YORK THERE IS NO ROMANCE INVOLVED WITH GANGSTERS IN THE TWENTY ONE ST CENTURY THIS IS A MIGHTY
