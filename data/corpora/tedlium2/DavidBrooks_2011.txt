DavidBrooks_2011 I GOT MY CURRENT JOB I WAS GIVEN A GOOD PIECE OF ADVICE WHICH WAS TO INTERVIEW THREE POLITICIANS EVERY DAY AND FROM THAT MUCH CONTACT WITH POLITICIANS I CAN TELL YOU THEY 'RE ALL EMOTIONAL FREAKS OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER THEY HAVE WHAT I CALLED LOGORRHEA DEMENTIA WHICH IS THEY TALK SO MUCH THEY DRIVE THEMSELVES INSANE
DavidBrooks_2011 I ONCE THIS WAS YEARS AGO I SAW TED KENNEDY AND DAN QUAYLE MEET IN THE WELL OF THE SENATE AND THEY WERE FRIENDS AND THEY HUGGED EACH OTHER AND THEY WERE LAUGHING AND THEIR FACES WERE LIKE THIS FAR APART AND THEY WERE MOVING AND GRINDING AND MOVING THEIR ARMS UP AND DOWN EACH OTHER AND I WAS LIKE GET A ROOM I DON 'T WANT TO SEE THIS
DavidBrooks_2011 BUT THEY HAVE THOSE SOCIAL SKILLS ANOTHER CASE LAST ELECTION CYCLE I WAS FOLLOWING MITT ROMNEY AROUND NEW HAMPSHIRE AND HE WAS CAMPAIGNING WITH HIS FIVE PERFECT SONS BIP CHIP RIP ZIP LIP AND DIP
DavidBrooks_2011 THE ROOM AND THEN AS HE 'S LEAVING THE DINER
DavidBrooks_2011 HE FIRST NAMES ALMOST EVERYBODY HE 'S JUST MET I WAS LIKE OKAY THAT 'S SOCIAL SKILL
DavidBrooks_2011 SO IN THE COURSE OF MY CAREER I HAVE COVERED A SERIES OF FAILURES WE SENT ECONOMISTS IN THE SOVIET UNION WITH PRIVATIZATION PLANS WHEN IT BROKE UP AND WHAT THEY REALLY LACKED WAS SOCIAL TRUST WE INVADED IRAQ WITH A MILITARY OBLIVIOUS TO THE CULTURAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL REALITIES
DavidBrooks_2011 WE HAD A FINANCIAL REGULATORY REGIME BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT TRADERS WERE RATIONAL CREATURES WHO WOULDN 'T DO ANYTHING STUPID FOR THIRTY YEARS I 'VE BEEN COVERING SCHOOL REFORM AND WE 'VE BASICALLY REORGANIZED THE BUREAUCRATIC BOXES CHARTERS PRIVATE SCHOOLS VOUCHERS
DavidBrooks_2011 BUT WE 'VE HAD DISAPPOINTING RESULTS YEAR AFTER YEAR AND THE FACT IS PEOPLE LEARN FROM PEOPLE THEY LOVE AND IF YOU 'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A TEACHER AND A STUDENT YOU 'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT REALITY BUT THAT REALITY IS EXPUNGED FROM OUR POLICY MAKING PROCESS
DavidBrooks_2011 AND SO THAT 'S LED TO A QUESTION FOR ME WHY ARE THE MOST SOCIALLY ATTUNED PEOPLE ON EARTH COMPLETELY DEHUMANIZED WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT POLICY AND I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THIS IS A SYMPTOM OF A LARGER PROBLEM
DavidBrooks_2011 THAT FOR CENTURIES WE 'VE INHERITED A VIEW OF HUMAN NATURE BASED ON THE NOTION THAT WE 'RE DIVIDED SELVES
DavidBrooks_2011 THAT REASON IS SEPARATED FROM THE EMOTIONS AND THAT SOCIETY PROGRESSES TO THE EXTENT THAT REASON CAN SUPPRESS THE PASSIONS
DavidBrooks_2011 AND IT 'S LED TO A VIEW OF HUMAN NATURE THAT WE 'RE RATIONAL INDIVIDUALS WHO RESPOND IN STRAIGHTFORWARD WAYS TO INCENTIVES AND IT 'S LED TO WAYS OF SEEING THE WORLD WHERE PEOPLE TRY TO USE THE ASSUMPTIONS OF PHYSICS TO MEASURE HOW HUMAN BEHAVIOR IS
DavidBrooks_2011 AND IT 'S PRODUCED A GREAT AMPUTATION A SHALLOW VIEW OF HUMAN NATURE WE 'RE REALLY GOOD AT TALKING ABOUT MATERIAL THINGS BUT WE 'RE REALLY BAD AT TALKING ABOUT EMOTIONS
DavidBrooks_2011 WE 'RE REALLY GOOD AT TALKING ABOUT SKILLS AND SAFETY AND HEALTH WE 'RE REALLY BAD AT TALKING ABOUT CHARACTER ALASDAIR MACINTYRE THE FAMOUS PHILOSOPHER SAID THAT WE HAVE THE CONCEPTS OF THE ANCIENT MORALITY OF VIRTUE HONOR GOODNESS
DavidBrooks_2011 BUT WE NO LONGER HAVE A SYSTEM BY WHICH TO CONNECT THEM
DavidBrooks_2011 AND SO THIS HAS LED TO A SHALLOW PATH IN POLITICS BUT ALSO IN A WHOLE RANGE OF HUMAN ENDEAVORS YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE WAY WE RAISE OUR YOUNG KIDS YOU GO TO AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AT THREE IN THE AFTERNOON
DavidBrooks_2011 IF THE WIND BLOWS THEM OVER THEY 'RE LIKE BEETLES STUCK THERE ON THE GROUND YOU SEE THESE CARS THAT DRIVE UP USUALLY IT 'S SAABS AND AUDIS AND VOLVOS BECAUSE IN CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS IT 'S SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE A LUXURY CAR SO LONG AS IT COMES FROM A COUNTRY HOSTILE TO U S FOREIGN POLICY THAT 'S FINE
DavidBrooks_2011 AND YOU CAN USUALLY TELL THE UBER MOMS BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY WEIGH LESS THAN THEIR OWN CHILDREN
DavidBrooks_2011 MOMENT OF CONCEPTION THEY 'RE DOING LITTLE BUTT EXERCISES BABIES FLOP OUT THEY 'RE FLASHING MANDARIN FLASHCARDS AT THE THINGS
DavidBrooks_2011 AND SOMETIMES THEY MAKE A SUCCESS OF THEMSELVES IN A SUPERFICIAL MANNER AND THEY MAKE A TON OF MONEY AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN SEE THEM AT VACATION PLACES LIKE JACKSON HOLE OR ASPEN AND THEY 'VE BECOME ELEGANT AND SLENDER THEY DON 'T REALLY HAVE THIGHS THEY JUST HAVE ONE ELEGANT CALVE ON TOP OF ANOTHER
DavidBrooks_2011 YOU SEE THEM ON THE MOUNTAINS UP THERE THEY 'RE CROSS COUNTRY SKIING UP THE MOUNTAIN WITH THESE GRIM EXPRESSIONS THAT MAKE DICK CHENEY LOOK LIKE JERRY LEWIS
DavidBrooks_2011 AND OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS I THINK WE 'VE BEEN GIVEN A DEEPER VIEW OF HUMAN NATURE AND A DEEPER VIEW OF WHO WE ARE
DavidBrooks_2011 AND IT 'S NOT BASED ON THEOLOGY OR PHILOSOPHY IT 'S IN THE STUDY OF THE MIND ACROSS ALL THESE SPHERES OF RESEARCH FROM NEUROSCIENCE TO THE COGNITIVE SCIENTISTS BEHAVIORAL ECONOMISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS SOCIOLOGY WE 'RE DEVELOPING A REVOLUTION IN CONSCIOUSNESS
DavidBrooks_2011 AND WHEN YOU SYNTHESIZE IT ALL IT 'S GIVING US A NEW VIEW OF HUMAN NATURE AND FAR FROM BEING A COLDLY MATERIALISTIC VIEW OF NATURE IT 'S A NEW HUMANISM IT 'S A NEW ENCHANTMENT AND I THINK WHEN YOU SYNTHESIZE THIS RESEARCH YOU START WITH THREE KEY INSIGHTS
DavidBrooks_2011 THE FIRST INSIGHT IS THAT WHILE THE CONSCIOUS MIND WRITES THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF OUR SPECIES THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND DOES MOST OF THE WORK
DavidBrooks_2011 PEOPLE NAMED LAWRENCE BECOME LAWYERS BECAUSE UNCONSCIOUSLY WE GRAVITATE TOWARD THINGS THAT SOUND FAMILIAR WHICH IS WHY I NAMED MY DAUGHTER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BROOKS
DavidBrooks_2011 STUDY THE FURNITURE LET IT MARINATE IN YOUR MIND DISTRACT YOURSELF AND THEN A FEW DAYS LATER GO WITH YOUR GUT BECAUSE UNCONSCIOUSLY YOU 'VE FIGURED IT OUT THE SECOND INSIGHT IS THAT EMOTIONS ARE AT THE CENTER OF OUR THINKING
DavidBrooks_2011 PEOPLE WITH STROKES AND LESIONS IN THE EMOTION PROCESSING PARTS OF THE BRAIN ARE NOT SUPER SMART THEY 'RE ACTUALLY SOMETIMES QUITE HELPLESS
DavidBrooks_2011 AND THE GIANT IN THE FIELD IS IN THE ROOM TONIGHT AND IS SPEAKING TOMORROW MORNING ANTONIO DAMASIO AND ONE OF THE THINGS HE 'S REALLY SHOWN US IS THAT EMOTIONS ARE NOT SEPARATE FROM REASON BUT THEY ARE THE FOUNDATION OF REASON BECAUSE THEY TELL US WHAT TO VALUE AND SO READING AND EDUCATING YOUR EMOTIONS IS ONE OF THE CENTRAL ACTIVITIES OF WISDOM
DavidBrooks_2011 NOW I 'M A MIDDLE AGED GUY I 'M NOT EXACTLY COMFORTABLE WITH EMOTIONS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BRAIN STORIES DESCRIBED THESE MIDDLE AGED GUYS THEY PUT THEM INTO A BRAIN SCAN MACHINE THIS IS APOCRYPHAL BY THE WAY BUT I DON 'T CARE AND THEY HAD THEM WATCH A HORROR MOVIE AND THEN THEY HAD THEM DESCRIBE THEIR FEELINGS TOWARD THEIR WIVES
DavidBrooks_2011 AND THE BRAIN SCANS WERE IDENTICAL IN BOTH ACTIVITIES
DavidBrooks_2011 AND THE THIRD INSIGHT IS THAT WE 'RE NOT PRIMARILY SELF CONTAINED INDIVIDUALS WE 'RE SOCIAL ANIMALS NOT RATIONAL ANIMALS WE EMERGE OUT OF RELATIONSHIPS AND WE ARE DEEPLY INTERPENETRATED ONE WITH ANOTHER
DavidBrooks_2011 AND SO WHEN WE SEE ANOTHER PERSON WE REENACT IN OUR OWN MINDS WHAT WE SEE IN THEIR MINDS WHEN WE WATCH A CAR CHASE IN A MOVIE IT 'S ALMOST AS IF WE ARE SUBTLY HAVING A CAR CHASE WHEN WE WATCH PORNOGRAPHY IT 'S A LITTLE LIKE HAVING SEX
DavidBrooks_2011 THOUGH PROBABLY NOT AS GOOD AND WE SEE THIS WHEN LOVERS WALK DOWN THE STREET WHEN A CROWD IN EGYPT OR TUNISIA GETS CAUGHT UP IN AN EMOTIONAL CONTAGION THE DEEP INTERPENETRATION
DavidBrooks_2011 AND THIS REVOLUTION IN WHO WE ARE
DavidBrooks_2011 GIVES US A DIFFERENT WAY OF SEEING I THINK POLITICS A DIFFERENT WAY MOST IMPORTANTLY OF SEEING HUMAN CAPITAL WE ARE NOW CHILDREN OF THE FRENCH ENLIGHTENMENT WE BELIEVE THAT REASON IS THE HIGHEST OF THE FACULTIES
DavidBrooks_2011 BUT I THINK THIS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE BRITISH ENLIGHTENMENT OR THE SCOTTISH ENLIGHTENMENT WITH DAVID HUME ADAM SMITH ACTUALLY HAD A BETTER HANDLE ON WHO WE ARE THAT REASON IS OFTEN WEAK OUR SENTIMENTS ARE STRONG AND OUR SENTIMENTS ARE OFTEN TRUSTWORTHY AND THIS WORK CORRECTS THAT BIAS IN OUR CULTURE THAT DEHUMANIZING BIAS
DavidBrooks_2011 IT GIVES US A DEEPER SENSE OF WHAT IT ACTUALLY TAKES FOR US TO THRIVE IN THIS LIFE
DavidBrooks_2011 WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HUMAN CAPITAL WE THINK ABOUT THE THINGS WE CAN MEASURE EASILY THINGS LIKE GRADES SAT 'S DEGREES THE NUMBER OF YEARS IN SCHOOLING WHAT IT REALLY TAKES
DavidBrooks_2011 TO DO WELL TO LEAD A MEANINGFUL LIFE ARE THINGS THAT ARE DEEPER THINGS WE DON 'T REALLY EVEN HAVE WORDS FOR AND SO LET ME LIST JUST A COUPLE OF THE THINGS I THINK THIS RESEARCH POINTS US TOWARD TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
DavidBrooks_2011 THE FIRST GIFT OR TALENT IS MINDSIGHT THE ABILITY TO ENTER INTO OTHER PEOPLE 'S MINDS AND LEARN WHAT THEY HAVE TO OFFER BABIES COME WITH THIS ABILITY MELTZOFF WHO 'S AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON LEANED OVER A BABY WHO WAS FORTY THREE MINUTES OLD
DavidBrooks_2011 HE WAGGED HIS TONGUE AT THE BABY THE BABY WAGGED HER TONGUE BACK
DavidBrooks_2011 BABIES ARE BORN TO INTERPENETRATE INTO MOM 'S MIND AND TO DOWNLOAD WHAT THEY FIND THEIR MODELS OF HOW TO UNDERSTAND REALITY IN THE UNITED STATES FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF BABIES HAVE A DEEP TWO WAY CONVERSATION WITH MOM AND THEY LEARN MODELS TO HOW TO RELATE TO OTHER PEOPLE
DavidBrooks_2011 AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MODELS OF HOW TO RELATE HAVE A HUGE HEAD START IN LIFE SCIENTISTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA DID A STUDY IN WHICH THEY COULD PREDICT WITH SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT ACCURACY AT AGE EIGHTEEN MONTHS
DavidBrooks_2011 WHO WAS GOING TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL BASED ON WHO HAD GOOD ATTACHMENT WITH MOM TWENTY PERCENT OF KIDS DO NOT HAVE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
DavidBrooks_2011 THEY ARE WHAT WE CALL AVOIDANTLY ATTACHED THEY HAVE TROUBLE RELATING TO OTHER PEOPLE THEY GO THROUGH LIFE LIKE SAILBOATS TACKING INTO THE WIND WANTING TO GET CLOSE TO PEOPLE BUT NOT REALLY HAVING THE MODELS OF HOW TO DO THAT
DavidBrooks_2011 AND SO THIS IS ONE SKILL OF HOW TO HOOVER UP KNOWLEDGE ONE FROM ANOTHER A SECOND SKILL IS EQUAL POISE
DavidBrooks_2011 THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE SERENITY TO READ THE BIASES AND FAILURES IN YOUR OWN MIND SO FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE OVERCONFIDENCE MACHINES NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR PROFESSORS REPORT THAT THEY ARE ABOVE AVERAGE TEACHERS NINETY SIX PERCENT OF COLLEGE STUDENTS SAY THEY HAVE ABOVE AVERAGE SOCIAL SKILLS
DavidBrooks_2011 TIME MAGAZINE ASKED AMERICANS ARE YOU IN THE TOP ONE PERCENT OF EARNERS NINETEEN PERCENT OF AMERICANS ARE IN THE TOP ONE PERCENT
DavidBrooks_2011 WOMEN BECAUSE MEN THINK THEY CAN SWIM ACROSS THAT LAKE
DavidBrooks_2011 BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE THE ABILITY AND AWARENESS OF THEIR OWN BIASES THEIR OWN OVERCONFIDENCE THEY HAVE EPISTEMOLOGICAL MODESTY THEY ARE OPEN MINDED IN THE FACE OF AMBIGUITY THEY ARE ABLE TO ADJUST STRENGTH OF THE CONCLUSIONS TO THE STRENGTH OF THEIR EVIDENCE
DavidBrooks_2011 THEY ARE CURIOUS AND THESE TRAITS ARE OFTEN UNRELATED AND UNCORRELATED WITH IQ THE THIRD TRAIT IS METIS
DavidBrooks_2011 WHAT WE MIGHT CALL STREET SMARTS IT 'S A GREEK WORD IT 'S A SENSITIVITY TO THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT THE ABILITY TO PICK OUT PATTERNS IN AN ENVIRONMENT DERIVE A GIST
DavidBrooks_2011 ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE TIMES DID A GREAT STORY ABOUT SOLDIERS IN IRAQ WHO COULD LOOK DOWN A STREET AND DETECT SOMEHOW WHETHER THERE WAS AN IED A LANDMINE IN THE STREET THEY COULDN 'T TELL YOU HOW THEY DID IT BUT THEY COULD FEEL COLD THEY FELT A COLDNESS
DavidBrooks_2011 AND THEY WERE MORE OFTEN RIGHT THAN WRONG
DavidBrooks_2011 THE THIRD IS WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL SYMPATHY THE ABILITY TO WORK WITHIN GROUPS
DavidBrooks_2011 AND THAT COMES IN TREMENDOUSLY HANDY BECAUSE GROUPS ARE SMARTER THAN INDIVIDUALS AND FACE TO FACE GROUPS ARE MUCH SMARTER THAN GROUPS THAT COMMUNICATE ELECTRONICALLY BECAUSE NINETY PERCENT OF OUR COMMUNICATION IS NON VERBAL
DavidBrooks_2011 THEN YOU COULD TALK ABOUT A TRAIT LIKE BLENDING ANY CHILD CAN SAY I 'M A TIGER PRETEND TO BE A TIGER IT SEEMS SO ELEMENTARY
DavidBrooks_2011 BUT IN FACT IT 'S PHENOMENALLY COMPLICATED TO TAKE A CONCEPT I AND A CONCEPT TIGER AND BLEND THEM TOGETHER BUT THIS IS THE SOURCE OF INNOVATION WHAT PICASSO DID FOR EXAMPLE WAS TAKE THE CONCEPT WESTERN ART AND THE CONCEPT AFRICAN MASKS
DavidBrooks_2011 AND BLEND THEM TOGETHER NOT ONLY THE GEOMETRY BUT THE MORAL SYSTEMS ENTAILED IN THEM AND THESE ARE SKILLS AGAIN WE CAN 'T COUNT AND MEASURE AND THEN THE FINAL THING I 'LL MENTION IS SOMETHING YOU MIGHT CALL LIMERENCE
DavidBrooks_2011 AND THIS IS NOT AN ABILITY IT 'S A DRIVE AND A MOTIVATION THE CONSCIOUS MIND HUNGERS FOR SUCCESS AND PRESTIGE THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND HUNGERS FOR THOSE MOMENTS OF TRANSCENDENCE WHEN THE SKULL LINE DISAPPEARS AND WE ARE LOST IN A CHALLENGE OR A TASK
DavidBrooks_2011 WHEN A CRAFTSMAN FEELS LOST IN HIS CRAFT WHEN A NATURALIST FEELS AT ONE WITH NATURE WHEN A BELIEVER FEELS AT ONE WITH GOD 'S LOVE THAT IS WHAT THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND HUNGERS FOR AND MANY OF US FEEL IT IN LOVE WHEN LOVERS FEEL FUSED
DavidBrooks_2011 AND ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTIONS I 'VE COME ACROSS IN THIS RESEARCH OF HOW MINDS INTERPENETRATE WAS WRITTEN BY A GREAT THEORIST AND SCIENTIST NAMED DOUGLAS HOFSTADTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF INDIANA HE WAS MARRIED TO A WOMAN NAMED CAROL
DavidBrooks_2011 AND THEY HAD A WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP WHEN THEIR KIDS WERE FIVE AND TWO CAROL HAD A STROKE AND A BRAIN TUMOR AND DIED SUDDENLY AND HOFSTADTER WROTE A BOOK CALLED I AM A STRANGE LOOP IN THE COURSE OF THAT BOOK HE DESCRIBES A MOMENT
DavidBrooks_2011 JUST MONTHS AFTER CAROL HAS DIED HE COMES ACROSS HER PICTURE ON THE MANTEL OR ON A BUREAU IN HIS BEDROOM AND HERE 'S WHAT HE WROTE
DavidBrooks_2011 I LOOKED AT HER FACE AND I LOOKED SO DEEPLY THAT I FELT I WAS BEHIND HER EYES AND ALL AT ONCE I FOUND MYSELF SAYING AS TEARS FLOWED THAT 'S ME THAT 'S ME AND THOSE SIMPLE WORDS BROUGHT BACK MANY THOUGHTS THAT I HAD HAD
DavidBrooks_2011 BEFORE ABOUT THE FUSION OF OUR SOULS INTO ONE HIGHER LEVEL ENTITY ABOUT THE FACT THAT AT THE CORE OF BOTH OUR SOULS LAY OUR IDENTICAL HOPES AND DREAMS FOR OUR CHILDREN ABOUT THE NOTION THAT THOSE HOPES WERE NOT SEPARATE OR DISTINCT HOPES BUT WERE JUST ONE HOPE ONE CLEAR THING THAT DEFINED US BOTH
DavidBrooks_2011 THAT WELDED US INTO A UNIT THE KIND OF UNIT I HAD BUT DIMLY IMAGINED BEFORE BEING MARRIED AND HAVING CHILDREN
DavidBrooks_2011 I REALIZED THAT THOUGH CAROL HAD DIED THAT CORE PIECE OF HER HAD NOT DIED AT ALL BUT HAD LIVED ON VERY DETERMINEDLY IN MY BRAIN THE GREEKS SAY WE SUFFER OUR WAY TO WISDOM THROUGH HIS SUFFERING HOFSTADTER UNDERSTOOD HOW DEEPLY INTERPENETRATED WE ARE
DavidBrooks_2011 THROUGH THE POLICY FAILURES OF THE LAST THIRTY YEARS WE HAVE COME TO ACKNOWLEDGE I THINK HOW SHALLOW OUR VIEW OF HUMAN NATURE HAS BEEN AND NOW AS WE CONFRONT THAT SHALLOWNESS AND THE FAILURES THAT DERIVE FROM OUR INABILITY TO GET THE DEPTHS OF WHO WE ARE
DavidBrooks_2011 COMES THIS REVOLUTION IN CONSCIOUSNESS THESE PEOPLE IN SO MANY FIELDS
DavidBrooks_2011 EXPLORING THE DEPTH OF OUR NATURE AND COMING AWAY WITH THIS ENCHANTED THIS NEW HUMANISM AND WHEN FREUD DISCOVERED HIS SENSE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS IT HAD A VAST EFFECT ON THE CLIMATE OF THE TIMES
DavidBrooks_2011 NOW WE ARE DISCOVERING A MORE ACCURATE VISION OF THE UNCONSCIOUS OF WHO WE ARE DEEP INSIDE AND IT 'S GOING TO HAVE A WONDERFUL AND PROFOUND AND HUMANIZING EFFECT ON OUR CULTURE THANK YOU
