BillStrickland_2002 THE ONLY THING STANDING BETWEEN YOU
BillStrickland_2002 AND THE GOOD NEWS IS
BillStrickland_2002 PEOPLE REMEMBER PICTURES LONG AFTER THEY'VE
BillStrickland_2002 IN A TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD
BillStrickland_2002 WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON I WAS WALKING DOWN
BillStrickland_2002 THE
BillStrickland_2002 NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE
BillStrickland_2002 THE ART ROOM AND I SAID WHAT IS THAT AND HE SAID CERAMICS AND WHO ARE YOU
BillStrickland_2002 TO SIGN A PIECE OF PAPER THAT SAYS YOU CAN
BillStrickland_2002 SO FOR THE REMAINING TWO YEARS OF MY HIGH SCHOOL
BillStrickland_2002 AND I DON'T WANT IT ON MY CONSCIENCE
BillStrickland_2002 SCHOOL AND I'M TAKING YOU WITH
BillStrickland_2002 HE DROVE ME OUT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH WHERE I FILLED OUT A COLLEGE APPLICATION
BillStrickland_2002 THE GUY WHO CAME FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD
BillStrickland_2002 WHO GOT INTO THE PLACE ON PROBATION DON'T GIVE UP ON THE POOR KIDS BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THOSE CHILDREN
BillStrickland_2002 IN LIFE
BillStrickland_2002 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES
BillStrickland_2002 I
BillStrickland_2002 ONE IS CALLED BIDWELL TRAINING
BillStrickland_2002 CENTER IT IS A VOCATIONAL SCHOOL FOR EX STEEL WORKERS AND
BillStrickland_2002 THE
BillStrickland_2002 IN VERY CLOSE
BillStrickland_2002 AS
BillStrickland_2002 AND LAST YEAR I SPOKE AT HIS MEMORIAL SERVICE
BillStrickland_2002 I WENT OUT AND HIRED A STUDENT OF FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT
BillStrickland_2002 BUILT IN A TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GIVEN UP FOR
BillStrickland_2002 THE LIFE OF
BillStrickland_2002 LOOK LIKE THE SOLUTION AND NOT THE PROBLEM AS YOU CAN
BillStrickland_2002 IT
BillStrickland_2002 THEIR COURTYARD I NOTICED THAT THEY HAD A
BillStrickland_2002 LIFE
BillStrickland_2002 BEFORE YOU EVER GIVE THEM A SPEECH
BillStrickland_2002 AND
BillStrickland_2002 IN MY VIEW
BillStrickland_2002 IS THIS KIND OF
BillStrickland_2002 WE ALSO
BillStrickland_2002 CREATED A BOARDROOM
BillStrickland_2002 AND I HIRED A JAPANESE CABINETMAKER FROM KYOTO JAPAN AND COMMISSIONED HIM TO DO SIXTY PIECES OF FURNITURE FOR OUR
BillStrickland_2002 CUSTOM FURNITURE FOR RICH PEOPLE AND I GOT SIXTY PIECES OUT OF IT FOR MY
BillStrickland_2002 BECAUSE I FELT THAT WELFARE
BillStrickland_2002 TO COME TO A SCHOOL WHERE THERE WAS HANDCRAFTED FURNITURE
BillStrickland_2002 BECAUSE IT SETS A TONE AND AN ATTITUDE ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT PEOPLE LONG BEFORE YOU GIVE THEM THE SPEECH
BillStrickland_2002 EVEN HAVE FLOWERS IN THE HALLWAY
BillStrickland_2002 AND THEY'RE NOT PLASTIC THOSE
BillStrickland_2002 AND WE WERE PARTICULARLY TOUCHED BY THE FLOWERS AND WE WERE CURIOUS AS TO HOW THE FLOWERS GOT THERE I SAID WELL I GOT IN MY CAR AND I WENT OUT TO THE
BillStrickland_2002 WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT THE CHILDREN AND THE ADULTS DESERVE FLOWERS IN THEIR LIFE
BillStrickland_2002 WE BELIEVE IN HOPE AND HUMAN POSSIBILITIES
BillStrickland_2002 AND SO THE NEXT THING YOU'LL SEE
BillStrickland_2002 A A MILLION
BillStrickland_2002 HEARD ABOUT MY DESIRE TO BUILD A NEW BUILDING BECAUSE I HAD A CARDBOARD BOX AND I PUT IT IN A GARBAGE BAG AND I WALKING ALL OVER PITTSBURGH TRYING TO RAISE MONEY FOR THIS SITE AND HE CALLED ME INTO HIS OFFICE WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT OF GOING TO SEE THE WIZARD OF
BillStrickland_2002 JOHN HEINZ HAD SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND AT THE TIME I HAD ABOUT
BillStrickland_2002 HE SAID BUT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU WE'VE HEARD ABOUT YOUR WORK WITH THE KIDS AND THE EX STEEL WORKERS
BillStrickland_2002 AND WE'RE INCLINED TO WANT TO SUPPORT YOUR DESIRE TO BUILD A NEW BUILDING AND YOU COULD DO US A GREAT SERVICE IF YOU WOULD ADD A CULINARY PROGRAM
BillStrickland_2002 TO YOUR PROGRAM BECAUSE BACK THEN WE WERE BUILDING A TRADES PROGRAM HE SAID THAT WAY WE COULD FULFILLL OUR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION GOALS
BillStrickland_2002 GO INTO A FIELD THAT I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT BUT I PROMISE YOU THAT IF YOU'LL SUPPORT MY SCHOOL I'LL GET IT BUILT AND IN A COUPLE OF YEARS I'LL COME BACK
BillStrickland_2002 AND WEIGH OUT THAT PROGRAM THAT YOU DESIRE
BillStrickland_2002 SAID WELL WHAT WOULD YOUR REACTION BE
BillStrickland_2002 I SAID SENATOR IT APPEARS THAT WE'RE GOING INTO THE FOOD TRAINING BUSINESS
BillStrickland_2002 AND JOHN HEINZ DID GIVE ME A MILLION
BillStrickland_2002 AND MOST IMPORTANTLY HE LOANED ME THE HEAD OF RESEARCH FOR THE HEINZ COMPANY AND WE KIND OF BORROWED THE CURRICULUM FROM THE CULINARY INSTITUTE OF AMERICA WHICH IN THEIR MIND IS KIND OF THE HARVARD
BillStrickland_2002 IN THIS MILLION DOLLAR KITCHEN THAT HAPPENS TO BE OUR CAFETERIA
BillStrickland_2002 PASTRY DAY WHY BECAUSE THE STUDENTS MADE PUFF PASTRY AND THAT'S WHAT THE SCHOOL ATE EVERY DAY
BillStrickland_2002 THE CONCEPT WAS THAT I WANTED TO TAKE THE STIGMA
BillStrickland_2002 GOOD FOOD 'S NOT FOR RICH PEOPLE GOOD FOOD 'S FOR EVERYBODY ON THE PLANET AND THERE'S NO EXCUSE WHY WE CAN'T ALL BE EATING IT SO AT
BillStrickland_2002 WE SUBSIDIZE A GOURMET LUNCH PROGRAM FOR WELFARE
BillStrickland_2002 I WANTED TO LET THEM KNOW EVERY DAY
BillStrickland_2002 BLACK KIDS AND WHITE
BillStrickland_2002 AND
BillStrickland_2002 NO SOPHISTICATION NO CLASS NO DIGNITY NO HISTORY WHAT WE'VE DISCOVERED IS THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH POOR PEOPLE IS THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY
BillStrickland_2002 HAPPENS TO BE A CURABLE CONDITION
BillStrickland_2002 IT'S ALL IN THE WAY THAT YOU THINK ABOUT PEOPLE THAT OFTEN DETERMINES
BillStrickland_2002 BY A STUDENT AFTER SEVEN MONTHS IN THE PROGRAM
BillStrickland_2002 DONE BY A VERY BRILLIANT YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS TAUGHT BY OUR
BillStrickland_2002 ACTUALLY EATEN SEVEN OF THOSE BASKETS AND THEY'RE VERY
BillStrickland_2002 THAT'S OUR DINING ROOM IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR AVERAGE HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA IN YOUR AVERAGE TOWN
BillStrickland_2002 THIS IS MY
BillStrickland_2002 WE TRAIN MEDICAL TECHNICIANS FOR THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY
BillStrickland_2002 AND WE TRAIN CHEMICAL TECHNICIANS FOR COMPANIES LIKE BAYER AND CALGON CARBON AND FISHER SCIENTIFIC AND EXXON AND I WILL GUARANTEE YOU THAT IF YOU COME TO MY CENTER IN PITTSBURGH
BillStrickland_2002 WELFARE MOTHERS DOING ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY WITH LOGARITHMIC CALCULATORS
BillStrickland_2002 TEN MONTHS FROM
BillStrickland_2002 PEOPLE CAN'T LEARN WORLD CLASS TECHNOLOGY WHAT WE'VE DISCOVERED
BillStrickland_2002 YOU HAVE TO GIVE
BillStrickland_2002 AND I HAVE
BillStrickland_2002 CHILDREN WITH HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS THAT THEY CAN'T READ
BillStrickland_2002 IN THE TWENTY ONE ST CENTURY
BillStrickland_2002 THAT WE GRADUATE CHILDREN FROM SCHOOLS WHO CAN'T READ THE DIPLOMAS THAT THEY
BillStrickland_2002 THE REASON IS THAT THE SYSTEM GETS REIMBURSED FOR THE KIDS THEY SPIT OUT AT THE OTHER END
BillStrickland_2002 NOT THE CHILDREN
BillStrickland_2002 I CAN TAKE THESE CHILDREN AND IN TWENTY WEEKS DEMONSTRATED APTITUDE
BillStrickland_2002 FOUR HUNDRED KIDS FROM THE PITTSBURGH PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT
BillStrickland_2002 FOR ARTS EDUCATION AND THESE ARE CHILDREN
BillStrickland_2002 LAST YEAR I PUT EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THOSE KIDS IN COLLEGE AND I'VE AVERAGED OVER
BillStrickland_2002 FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WE'VE MADE A FASCINATING
BillStrickland_2002 AND
BillStrickland_2002 THAT
BillStrickland_2002 I FIGURED THAT IF
BillStrickland_2002 TREAT CHILDREN LIKE HUMAN BEINGS IT INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THEY'RE GOING TO BEHAVE THAT WAY
BillStrickland_2002 AND WHY WE CAN'T INSTITUTE
BillStrickland_2002 IN EVERY SCHOOL AND IN EVERY CITY
BillStrickland_2002 LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT
BillStrickland_2002 IN FACT
BillStrickland_2002 I BROUGHT IN A MOSAIC ARTIST FROM THE VATICAN AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN WHO HAD STUDIED THE OLD VATICAN MOSAIC TECHNIQUES AND LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT
BillStrickland_2002 SUNLIGHT
BillStrickland_2002 TEACH PHOTOGRAPHY
BillStrickland_2002 FOUR
BillStrickland_2002 WE HAVE A WORLD CLASS GALLERY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT
BillStrickland_2002 SO I DESIGNED THIS THING
BillStrickland_2002 WE HAVE SMOKED SALMON AT THE
BillStrickland_2002 AND I EVEN HAVE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO GET THEIR PARENTS TO COME I COULDN'T BUY A PARENT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO SO I HIRED A GUY WHO GOT OFF
BillStrickland_2002 I
BillStrickland_2002 I CAN'T GET THESE PARENTS TO COME TO THE SCHOOL HE SAID I 'LL GET THEM TO
BillStrickland_2002 ART OPENING BUT YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE
BillStrickland_2002 ONE
BillStrickland_2002 CHILDREN AT THE MANCHESTER CRAFTSMEN 'S GUILD BECAUSE
BillStrickland_2002 THERE IS NO STATISTICAL DIFFERENCE
BillStrickland_2002 BETWEEN THE WHITE PARENTS

BillStrickland_2002 AND I DID ALL RIGHT AND THE WOMAN CAME OUT OF THE AUDIENCE SHE SAID THAT WAS A GREAT STORY AND I WAS VERY
BillStrickland_2002 CRITICISM IS YOUR COMPUTERS ARE GETTING A LITTLE BIT OLD AND I SAID WELL WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING
BillStrickland_2002 YOU THAT HP AND A FURNITURE COMPANY CALLED STEELCASE HAVE ADOPTED US AS A DEMONSTRATION MODEL FOR ALL OF THEIR TECHNOLOGY AND ALL
BillStrickland_2002 YOU SO IT'S KIND OF THE WORLD DEBUT OF OUR DIGITAL IMAGING CENTER

BillStrickland_2002 THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO WHEN I GROW UP
BillStrickland_2002 THE BROWN BUILDING IS THE ONE YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT AND I'LL TELL YOU WHERE I MADE MY
BillStrickland_2002 I HAD A CHANCE TO BUY THIS
BillStrickland_2002 WHOLE INDUSTRIAL PARK WHICH IS LESS THAN ONE THOUSAND FEET FROM THE RIVERFRONT
BillStrickland_2002 FOR FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND I DIDN'T DO IT
BillStrickland_2002 AND I BUILT THE FIRST BUILDING AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENED
BillStrickland_2002 I APPRECIATED THE REAL ESTATE VALUES BEYOND EVERYBODY 'S EXPECTATIONS
BillStrickland_2002 AND THE OWNERS OF THE PARK TURNED ME DOWN FOR EIGHT
BillStrickland_2002 AND SAID MISTER STRICKLAND
BillStrickland_2002 THIS IS IN A PLACE CALLED
BillStrickland_2002 THE REASON THIS PICTURE 'S IN HERE
BillStrickland_2002 I DID THIS SLIDE SHOW A COUPLE YEARS AGO AT A BIG ECONOMICS SUMMIT AND THERE WAS A FELLOW IN THE AUDIENCE WHO CAME UP TO ME HE SAID MAN THAT'S A GREAT STORY I WANT ONE
BillStrickland_2002 WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING HE SAYS
BillStrickland_2002 WILLIE BROWN
BillStrickland_2002 AND SO I KIND OF
BillStrickland_2002 THE FLATTERY AND THE PRAISE AND PUT IT OUT OF MY MIND AND THAT WEEKEND I WAS GOING BACK HOME
BillStrickland_2002 AND HERBIE HANCOCK WAS PLAYING AT OUR CENTER THAT
BillStrickland_2002 AND HE SAID AS GOD IS
BillStrickland_2002 I'VE HAD A CENTER LIKE THIS IN MY MIND FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND YOU'VE BUILT IT AND NOW I REALLY
BillStrickland_2002 HE
BillStrickland_2002 CHANCE YOU KNOW WILLIE BROWN
BillStrickland_2002 AS A MATTER OF FACT HE DID KNOW WILLIE BROWN AND WILLIE BROWN AND HERBIE AND I
BillStrickland_2002 FOUR YEARS AGO AND WE STARTED DRAWING OUT THAT CENTER ON THE
BillStrickland_2002 WILLIE BROWN SAID AS SURE AS
BillStrickland_2002 HE GOT ME FIVE ACRES OF LAND ON SAN FRANCISCO BAY
BillStrickland_2002 WE GOT AN ARCHITECT AND WE GOT A GENERAL CONTRACTOR AND WE GOT HERBIE ON THE BOARD
BillStrickland_2002 AND OUR FRIENDS FROM HP AND OUR FRIENDS FROM STEELCASE AND OUR FRIENDS FROM CISCO AND OUR FRIENDS FROM WELLS FARGO AND
BillStrickland_2002 AND ALONG THE WAY I MET THIS REAL SHORT
BillStrickland_2002 SLIDE SHOW IN THE SILICON VALLEY
BillStrickland_2002 TO ME AFTERWARDS HE SAID
BillStrickland_2002 MAN THAT'S A FABULOUS STORY
BillStrickland_2002 I WANT TO HELP YOU AND I SAID WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING HE SAID WELL
BillStrickland_2002 VERY NICE THANKS VERY MUCH AND GIVE ME YOUR CARD AND SOMETIME WE'LL TALK I DIDN'T KNOW EBAY FROM THAT
BillStrickland_2002 JAR OF WATER SITTING ON THAT PIANO
BillStrickland_2002 BUT I HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO GO BACK AND TALK TO ONE OF THE TECHIE KIDS AT MY CENTER I SAID HEY MAN WHAT IS EBAY HE SAID WELL THAT'S THE ELECTRONIC COMMERCE NETWORK
BillStrickland_2002 AND HE LEFT ME HIS CARD SO I CALLED HIM UP ON THE PHONE AND I SAID MISTER SKOLL I'VE COME TO HAVE A MUCH DEEPER APPRECIATION OF WHO YOU ARE
BillStrickland_2002 JEFF AND I DID BECOME FRIENDS
BillStrickland_2002 AND HE 'S ORGANIZED A TEAM OF
BillStrickland_2002 AND WE'RE GOING TO BUILD THIS
BillStrickland_2002 AND I WENT DOWN INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD
BillStrickland_2002 CALLED BAYVIEW HUNTERS POINT AND I SAID
BillStrickland_2002 THE MAYOR SENT ME DOWN TO WORK WITH YOU
BillStrickland_2002 AND I WANT TO BUILD A CENTER WITH YOU BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BUILD YOU ANYTHING IF YOU
BillStrickland_2002 AND SO
BillStrickland_2002 TWO HUNDRED VERY ANGRY
BillStrickland_2002 AND I STARTED SHOWING THESE PICTURES AND AFTER ABOUT TEN PICTURES THEY ALL SETTLED DOWN
BillStrickland_2002 OF THE ROOM A WOMAN STOOD UP AND SHE SAID IN THIRTY FIVE
BillStrickland_2002 COME DOWN HERE
BillStrickland_2002 AND SHE TURNED THAT AUDIENCE AROUND ON A PIN AND I
BillStrickland_2002 I THINK WE CAN GET IN THE GROUND THIS YEAR
BillStrickland_2002 THE FIRST REPLICATION OF THE CENTER
BillStrickland_2002 AND
BillStrickland_2002 SAID I WANT TO HELP YOU MAN
BillStrickland_2002 LET 'S DO ONE IN L A
BillStrickland_2002 AND SO HE 'S
BillStrickland_2002 PEOPLE AND I'VE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HIM AS I HAVE WITH HERBIE AND WITH
BillStrickland_2002 SAID WHERE DID THE IDEA
BillStrickland_2002 FOR CENTERS LIKE THIS COME FROM
BillStrickland_2002 BECAUSE MISTER ROSS USED TO BRING IN YOUR ALBUMS WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD
BillStrickland_2002 WHEN THE WORLD WAS ALL DARK
BillStrickland_2002 THAT'S NOT TRUE
BillStrickland_2002 I BELIEVE IN YOUR HOPES AND YOUR DREAMS
BillStrickland_2002 I BELIEVE IN YOUR INTELLIGENCE AND I BELIEVE IN YOUR
BillStrickland_2002 AND I'M TIRED OF
BillStrickland_2002 GOING INTO TOWN AFTER TOWN WITH PEOPLE STANDING AROUND ON CORNERS WITH
BillStrickland_2002 EYES USED TO BE
BillStrickland_2002 THEIR SPIRITS DAMAGED
BillStrickland_2002 WE WON 'T MAKE IT AS A COUNTRY UNLESS WE CAN TURN THIS THING AROUND
BillStrickland_2002 AND PENNSYLVANIA IT COSTS SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO KEEP PEOPLE IN JAIL MOST OF WHOM LOOK LIKE ME
BillStrickland_2002 FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BUILD THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH MEDICAL SCHOOL
BillStrickland_2002 IT'S TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS CHEAPER TO
BillStrickland_2002 VERY DECENT PEOPLE
BillStrickland_2002 I THINK WE CAN BUILD THESE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
BillStrickland_2002 AND I BELIEVE WE CAN TURN THIS WHOLE STORY AROUND TO ONE OF CELEBRATION
BillStrickland_2002 IN MY BUSINESS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT WORK YOU'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING UPSTREAM LIKE
BillStrickland_2002 NEVER ENOUGH MONEY TOO MUCH
BillStrickland_2002 AND SO THERE IS A TENDENCY TO HAVE AN OCCUPATIONAL DEPRESSION THAT ACCOMPANIES MY WORK AND SO I'VE FIGURED OUT
BillStrickland_2002 THE SOLUTION TO THE DEPRESSION
BillStrickland_2002 YOU MAKE A FRIEND
BillStrickland_2002 MADE A FEW
BillStrickland_2002 AND
