BillStrickland_2002@180.65:180.79 THE
BillStrickland_2002@213.99:215.01 IN VERY CLOSE
BillStrickland_2002@223.43:223.57 AS
BillStrickland_2002@225.29:228.60 AND LAST YEAR I SPOKE AT HIS MEMORIAL SERVICE
BillStrickland_2002@234.07:237.01 I WENT OUT AND HIRED A STUDENT OF FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT
BillStrickland_2002@257.51:260.68 BUILT IN A TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GIVEN UP FOR
BillStrickland_2002@264.69:266.11 THE LIFE OF
BillStrickland_2002@269.77:274.54 LOOK LIKE THE SOLUTION AND NOT THE PROBLEM AS YOU CAN
BillStrickland_2002@282.96:283.16 IT
BillStrickland_2002@292.45:294.32 THEIR COURTYARD I NOTICED THAT THEY HAD A
BillStrickland_2002@313.28:313.74 LIFE
BillStrickland_2002@321.61:323.31 BEFORE YOU EVER GIVE THEM A SPEECH
BillStrickland_2002@325.14:325.47 AND
BillStrickland_2002@355.62:356.51 IN MY VIEW
BillStrickland_2002@358.05:359.07 IS THIS KIND OF
BillStrickland_2002@364.44:365.81 WE ALSO
BillStrickland_2002@366.95:369.68 CREATED A BOARDROOM
BillStrickland_2002@370.03:376.80 AND I HIRED A JAPANESE CABINETMAKER FROM KYOTO JAPAN AND COMMISSIONED HIM TO DO SIXTY PIECES OF FURNITURE FOR OUR
BillStrickland_2002@382.63:386.08 CUSTOM FURNITURE FOR RICH PEOPLE AND I GOT SIXTY PIECES OUT OF IT FOR MY
BillStrickland_2002@387.47:389.11 BECAUSE I FELT THAT WELFARE
BillStrickland_2002@392.69:396.46 TO COME TO A SCHOOL WHERE THERE WAS HANDCRAFTED FURNITURE
BillStrickland_2002@398.18:405.55 BECAUSE IT SETS A TONE AND AN ATTITUDE ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT PEOPLE LONG BEFORE YOU GIVE THEM THE SPEECH
BillStrickland_2002@406.45:408.25 EVEN HAVE FLOWERS IN THE HALLWAY
BillStrickland_2002@409.08:410.32 AND THEY'RE NOT PLASTIC THOSE
BillStrickland_2002@423.96:431.67 AND WE WERE PARTICULARLY TOUCHED BY THE FLOWERS AND WE WERE CURIOUS AS TO HOW THE FLOWERS GOT THERE I SAID WELL I GOT IN MY CAR AND I WENT OUT TO THE
BillStrickland_2002@441.03:446.00 WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT THE CHILDREN AND THE ADULTS DESERVE FLOWERS IN THEIR LIFE
BillStrickland_2002@455.86:458.14 WE BELIEVE IN HOPE AND HUMAN POSSIBILITIES
BillStrickland_2002@460.75:463.18 AND SO THE NEXT THING YOU'LL SEE
BillStrickland_2002@464.28:464.80 A A MILLION
BillStrickland_2002@481.14:493.79 HEARD ABOUT MY DESIRE TO BUILD A NEW BUILDING BECAUSE I HAD A CARDBOARD BOX AND I PUT IT IN A GARBAGE BAG AND I WALKING ALL OVER PITTSBURGH TRYING TO RAISE MONEY FOR THIS SITE AND HE CALLED ME INTO HIS OFFICE WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT OF GOING TO SEE THE WIZARD OF
BillStrickland_2002@495.33:498.42 JOHN HEINZ HAD SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND AT THE TIME I HAD ABOUT
BillStrickland_2002@499.94:504.58 HE SAID BUT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU WE'VE HEARD ABOUT YOUR WORK WITH THE KIDS AND THE EX STEEL WORKERS
BillStrickland_2002@505.80:514.67 AND WE'RE INCLINED TO WANT TO SUPPORT YOUR DESIRE TO BUILD A NEW BUILDING AND YOU COULD DO US A GREAT SERVICE IF YOU WOULD ADD A CULINARY PROGRAM
BillStrickland_2002@515.43:522.45 TO YOUR PROGRAM BECAUSE BACK THEN WE WERE BUILDING A TRADES PROGRAM HE SAID THAT WAY WE COULD FULFILLL OUR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION GOALS
BillStrickland_2002@527.45:535.49 GO INTO A FIELD THAT I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT BUT I PROMISE YOU THAT IF YOU'LL SUPPORT MY SCHOOL I'LL GET IT BUILT AND IN A COUPLE OF YEARS I'LL COME BACK

BillStrickland_2002@542.57:544.30 SAID WELL WHAT WOULD YOUR REACTION BE
BillStrickland_2002@548.78:552.16 I SAID SENATOR IT APPEARS THAT WE'RE GOING INTO THE FOOD TRAINING BUSINESS
BillStrickland_2002@560.26:561.91 AND JOHN HEINZ DID GIVE ME A MILLION
BillStrickland_2002@562.39:573.14 AND MOST IMPORTANTLY HE LOANED ME THE HEAD OF RESEARCH FOR THE HEINZ COMPANY AND WE KIND OF BORROWED THE CURRICULUM FROM THE CULINARY INSTITUTE OF AMERICA WHICH IN THEIR MIND IS KIND OF THE HARVARD
BillStrickland_2002@591.29:594.47 IN THIS MILLION DOLLAR KITCHEN THAT HAPPENS TO BE OUR CAFETERIA
BillStrickland_2002@596.51:601.34 PASTRY DAY WHY BECAUSE THE STUDENTS MADE PUFF PASTRY AND THAT'S WHAT THE SCHOOL ATE EVERY DAY
BillStrickland_2002@602.88:606.58 THE CONCEPT WAS THAT I WANTED TO TAKE THE STIGMA
BillStrickland_2002@608.73:616.14 GOOD FOOD 'S NOT FOR RICH PEOPLE GOOD FOOD 'S FOR EVERYBODY ON THE PLANET AND THERE'S NO EXCUSE WHY WE CAN'T ALL BE EATING IT SO AT
BillStrickland_2002@617.68:620.97 WE SUBSIDIZE A GOURMET LUNCH PROGRAM FOR WELFARE
BillStrickland_2002@628.99:631.32 I WANTED TO LET THEM KNOW EVERY DAY
BillStrickland_2002@641.28:642.36 BLACK KIDS AND WHITE
BillStrickland_2002@645.76:646.13 AND
BillStrickland_2002@666.45:678.56 NO SOPHISTICATION NO CLASS NO DIGNITY NO HISTORY WHAT WE'VE DISCOVERED IS THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH POOR PEOPLE IS THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY
BillStrickland_2002@679.32:681.02 HAPPENS TO BE A CURABLE CONDITION
BillStrickland_2002@681.85:685.80 IT'S ALL IN THE WAY THAT YOU THINK ABOUT PEOPLE THAT OFTEN DETERMINES
BillStrickland_2002@688.22:690.86 BY A STUDENT AFTER SEVEN MONTHS IN THE PROGRAM
BillStrickland_2002@691.78:694.59 DONE BY A VERY BRILLIANT YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS TAUGHT BY OUR
BillStrickland_2002@696.75:699.05 ACTUALLY EATEN SEVEN OF THOSE BASKETS AND THEY'RE VERY
BillStrickland_2002@703.70:710.08 THAT'S OUR DINING ROOM IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR AVERAGE HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA IN YOUR AVERAGE TOWN
BillStrickland_2002@712.02:712.91 THIS IS MY
BillStrickland_2002@724.74:727.62 WE TRAIN MEDICAL TECHNICIANS FOR THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY
BillStrickland_2002@728.92:741.47 AND WE TRAIN CHEMICAL TECHNICIANS FOR COMPANIES LIKE BAYER AND CALGON CARBON AND FISHER SCIENTIFIC AND EXXON AND I WILL GUARANTEE YOU THAT IF YOU COME TO MY CENTER IN PITTSBURGH
BillStrickland_2002@743.71:747.77 WELFARE MOTHERS DOING ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY WITH LOGARITHMIC CALCULATORS
BillStrickland_2002@748.45:749.09 TEN MONTHS FROM
BillStrickland_2002@755.66:759.12 PEOPLE CAN'T LEARN WORLD CLASS TECHNOLOGY WHAT WE'VE DISCOVERED
BillStrickland_2002@760.48:761.17 YOU HAVE TO GIVE
BillStrickland_2002@786.33:786.77 AND I HAVE
BillStrickland_2002@787.04:790.81 CHILDREN WITH HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS THAT THEY CAN'T READ
BillStrickland_2002@797.17:798.77 IN THE TWENTY ONE ST CENTURY
BillStrickland_2002@800.43:804.14 THAT WE GRADUATE CHILDREN FROM SCHOOLS WHO CAN'T READ THE DIPLOMAS THAT THEY
BillStrickland_2002@806.16:810.75 THE REASON IS THAT THE SYSTEM GETS REIMBURSED FOR THE KIDS THEY SPIT OUT AT THE OTHER END
BillStrickland_2002@811.79:812.92 NOT THE CHILDREN
BillStrickland_2002@814.94:819.61 I CAN TAKE THESE CHILDREN AND IN TWENTY WEEKS DEMONSTRATED APTITUDE
BillStrickland_2002@853.93:857.16 FOUR HUNDRED KIDS FROM THE PITTSBURGH PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT
BillStrickland_2002@859.98:862.40 FOR ARTS EDUCATION AND THESE ARE CHILDREN
BillStrickland_2002@865.15:868.31 LAST YEAR I PUT EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THOSE KIDS IN COLLEGE AND I'VE AVERAGED OVER

BillStrickland_2002@874.63:874.82 AND
BillStrickland_2002@885.04:885.34 THAT
BillStrickland_2002@890.85:891.92 I FIGURED THAT IF
BillStrickland_2002@892.16:896.35 TREAT CHILDREN LIKE HUMAN BEINGS IT INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THEY'RE GOING TO BEHAVE THAT WAY
BillStrickland_2002@897.16:898.88 AND WHY WE CAN'T INSTITUTE
BillStrickland_2002@901.21:904.33 IN EVERY SCHOOL AND IN EVERY CITY
BillStrickland_2002@909.34:910.39 LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT
