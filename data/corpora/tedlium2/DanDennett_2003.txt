DanDennett_2003@14.60:28.18 A PROBLEM THAT I HAVE AND THAT'S THAT I'M A PHILOSOPHER WHEN I GO TO A PARTY AND PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT DO I DO AND I SAY I 'M A PROFESSOR THEIR EYES GLAZE OVER
DanDennett_2003@29.35:38.17 WHEN I GO TO AN ACADEMIC COCKTAIL PARTY AND THERE ARE ALL THE PROFESSORS AROUND THEY ASK ME WHAT FIELD I'M IN AND I SAY PHILOSOPHY THEIR EYES GLAZE OVER
DanDennett_2003@40.69:42.94 WHEN I GO TO A PHILOSOPHER 'S PARTY
DanDennett_2003@56.79:64.14 AND I GET HOOTS OF DERISION AND CACKLES AND GROWLS BECAUSE THEY THINK
DanDennett_2003@65.47:72.56 IMPOSSIBLE YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN CONSCIOUSNESS THE VERY CHUTZPAH OF SOMEBODY THINKING THAT YOU COULD EXPLAIN CONSCIOUSNESS IS JUST OUT OF THE QUESTION
DanDennett_2003@73.18:80.77 MY LATE LAMENTED FRIEND BOB NOZICK A FINE PHILOSOPHER IN ONE OF HIS BOOKS PHILOSOPHICAL EXPLANATIONS
DanDennett_2003@97.18:108.37 YOU GIVE YOUR AUDIENCE THE PREMISES AND THEN YOU GIVE THEM THE INFERENCES AND THE CONCLUSION AND IF THEY DON'T ACCEPT THE CONCLUSION THEY DIE
DanDennett_2003@109.75:123.77 THEIR HEADS EXPLODE THE IDEA IS TO HAVE AN ARGUMENT THAT IS SO POWERFUL THAT IT KNOCKS OUT YOUR OPPONENTS BUT IN FACT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE PEOPLE 'S MINDS AT ALL IT'S VERY HARD TO CHANGE PEOPLE 'S MINDS ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE CONSCIOUSNESS AND
DanDennett_2003@131.34:138.28 HEARD THE OTHER DAY THAT EVERYBODY 'S GOT A STRONG OPINION ABOUT VIDEO GAMES THEY ALL HAVE AN IDEA FOR A VIDEO GAME EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT
DanDennett_2003@147.94:150.22 WARMING OR ON THE FUTURE OF
DanDennett_2003@150.37:159.54 THE INTERNET ENCOUNTER PEOPLE WHO HAVE VERY STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT BUT THEY PROBABLY DON'T THINK OF THESE OPINIONS
DanDennett_2003@160.85:172.03 EXPERTISE THEY'RE JUST STRONGLY HELD OPINIONS BUT WITH REGARD TO CONSCIOUSNESS PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK EACH OF US SEEMS TO THINK I AM AN EXPERT SIMPLY BY BEING CONSCIOUS
DanDennett_2003@172.36:180.43 I KNOW ALL ABOUT THIS AND SO YOU TELL THEM YOUR THEORY AND THEY SAY NO NO THAT'S NOT THE WAY CONSCIOUSNESS IS NO YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG AND THEY SAY THIS WITH AN AMAZING
DanDennett_2003@203.85:217.19 THIS NICE PICTURE SHOWS A THOUGHT BALLOON A THOUGHT BUBBLE I THINK EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THAT MEANS THAT'S SUPPOSED TO EXHIBIT THE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS THIS IS MY FAVORITE PICTURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT'S EVER BEEN DONE IT'S A SAUL STEINBERG OF COURSE IT WAS A NEW YORKER COVER AND THIS
DanDennett_2003@217.73:227.28 FELLOW HERE IS LOOKING AT THE PAINTING BY BRAQUE THAT REMINDS HIM OF THE WORD BAROQUE BARRACK BARK POODLE SUZANNE R HE 'S OFF TO THE RACES
DanDennett_2003@228.93:237.66 A WONDERFUL STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS HERE AND IF YOU FOLLOW IT ALONG YOU LEARN A LOT ABOUT THIS MAN WHAT I PARTICULARLY LIKE ABOUT THIS PICTURE TOO IS THAT
DanDennett_2003@246.82:255.49 WHAT EACH OF US IS WHAT YOU ARE WHAT I AM IS APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED TRILLION LITTLE CELLULAR ROBOTS
DanDennett_2003@268.47:281.86 SOMEHOW WE HAVE TO EXPLAIN HOW WHEN YOU PUT TOGETHER TEAMS ARMIES BATTALIONS OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF LITTLE ROBOTIC UNCONSCIOUS CELLS NOT SO DIFFERENT REALLY FROM A BACTERIUM EACH ONE OF THEM
DanDennett_2003@282.68:291.08 THE RESULT IS THIS I MEAN JUST LOOK AT IT THE CONTENT THERE'S COLOR THERE'S IDEAS THERE'S MEMORIES THERE'S HISTORY
DanDennett_2003@291.79:299.96 AND SOMEHOW ALL THAT CONTENT OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE BUSY ACTIVITY OF THOSE HOARDS OF NEURONS HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
DanDennett_2003@300.59:308.68 MANY PEOPLE JUST THINK IT ISN'T POSSIBLE AT ALL THEY THINK NO THERE CAN'T BE ANY SORT OF NATURALISTIC EXPLANATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS
DanDennett_2003@309.20:319.38 THIS IS A LOVELY BOOK BY A FRIEND OF MINE NAMED LEE SIEGEL WHO 'S A PROFESSOR OF RELIGION ACTUALLY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AND HE 'S AN EXPERT MAGICIAN AND AN EXPERT ON THE STREET MAGIC OF INDIA
DanDennett_2003@319.75:330.11 WHICH IS WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT NET OF MAGIC AND THERE'S A PASSAGE IN IT WHICH I WOULD LOVE TO SHARE WITH YOU IT SPEAKS SO ELOQUENTLY TO THE PROBLEM
DanDennett_2003@332.96:345.12 I 'M WRITING A BOOK ON MAGIC I EXPLAIN AND I'M ASKED REAL MAGIC BY REAL MAGIC PEOPLE MEAN MIRACLES THAUMATURGICAL ACTS AND SUPERNATURAL POWERS NO I ANSWER CONJURING TRICKS NOT REAL MAGIC
DanDennett_2003@345.99:353.92 REAL MAGIC IN OTHER WORDS REFERS TO THE MAGIC THAT IS NOT REAL WHILE THE MAGIC THAT IS REAL THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE DONE IS NOT REAL MAGIC
DanDennett_2003@358.13:361.64 NOW THAT'S THE WAY A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS
DanDennett_2003@363.79:371.25 REAL CONSCIOUSNESS IS NOT A BAG OF TRICKS IF YOU'RE GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS AS A BAG OF TRICKS THEN IT'S NOT REAL CONSCIOUSNESS WHATEVER IT IS AND
DanDennett_2003@373.14:378.51 MARVIN SAID AND AS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SAID CONSCIOUSNESS IS A BAG OF TRICKS
DanDennett_2003@379.30:388.87 THIS MEANS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE JUST LEFT COMPLETELY DISSATISFIED AND INCREDULOUS WHEN I ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN CONSCIOUSNESS SO THIS IS THE PROBLEM SO I HAVE TO
DanDennett_2003@391.10:398.40 TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF THE SORT OF WORK THAT A LOT OF YOU WON 'T LIKE FOR THE SAME REASON THAT YOU DON'T LIKE
DanDennett_2003@398.92:411.11 A MAGIC TRICK EXPLAINED TO YOU HOW MANY OF YOU HERE IF SOMEBODY SOME SMART ALECK STARTS TELLING YOU HOW A PARTICULAR MAGIC TRICK IS DONE YOU SORT OF WANT TO BLOCK YOUR EARS AND SAY NO NO I DON'T WANT TO KNOW
DanDennett_2003@411.92:421.03 DON'T TAKE THE THRILL OF IT AWAY I'D RATHER BE MYSTIFIED DON'T TELL ME THE ANSWER A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS I'VE DISCOVERED AND
DanDennett_2003@421.97:430.41 I'M SORRY IF I IMPOSE SOME CLARITY SOME UNDERSTANDING ON YOU YOU'D BETTER LEAVE NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW SOME OF THESE TRICKS
DanDennett_2003@431.80:436.86 BUT I'M NOT GOING TO EXPLAIN IT ALL TO YOU I'M GOING TO DO WHAT PHILOSOPHERS DO
DanDennett_2003@448.08:454.69 YOU HOW THAT'S DONE YOU SEE THE MAGICIAN DOESN'T REALLY SAW THE LADY IN HALF
DanDennett_2003@457.81:463.93 HE MERELY MAKES YOU THINK THAT HE DOES AND YOU SAY YES AND HOW DOES HE DO THAT HE SAYS OH THAT'S NOT MY DEPARTMENT
DanDennett_2003@469.52:478.23 SO NOW I'M GOING TO ILLUSTRATE HOW PHILOSOPHERS EXPLAIN CONSCIOUSNESS BUT I'M GOING TO TRY TO ALSO SHOW YOU THAT CONSCIOUSNESS ISN'T QUITE AS MARVELOUS
DanDennett_2003@478.72:487.67 YOUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS ISN'T QUITE AS WONDERFUL AS YOU MAY HAVE THOUGHT IT IS THIS IS SOMETHING BY THE WAY THAT LEE SIEGEL TALKS ABOUT IN HIS BOOK HE MARVELS AT HOW
DanDennett_2003@489.13:498.85 MAGIC SHOW AND AFTERWARDS PEOPLE WILL SWEAR THEY SAW HIM DOING X Y AND Z HE NEVER DID THOSE THINGS HE DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO DO THOSE THINGS PEOPLE 'S MEMORIES INFLATE
DanDennett_2003@499.20:511.32 WHAT THEY THINK THEY SAW AND THE SAME IS TRUE OF CONSCIOUSNESS NOW LET 'S SEE IF THIS WILL WORK ALL RIGHT LET 'S JUST WATCH THIS WATCH IT CAREFULLY
DanDennett_2003@534.76:543.65 WE'RE LOOKING FOR A BACKER IT'S A FEATURE LENGTH DOCUMENTARY ON CONSCIOUSNESS OK NOW YOU ALL SAW WHAT CHANGED RIGHT
DanDennett_2003@562.82:564.23 THEY'RE ALL GOING TO CHANGE COLOR
DanDennett_2003@586.91:596.47 WHERE I SAID IF YOU DID EXPERIMENTS OF THIS SORT YOU'LL FIND THAT PEOPLE WERE UNABLE TO PICK UP REALLY LARGE CHANGES IF THERE'S TIME AT THE END I'LL SHOW YOU THE MUCH MORE DRAMATIC CASE
DanDennett_2003@597.57:605.82 NOW HOW CAN IT BE THAT THERE ARE ALL THOSE CHANGES GOING ON AND THAT WE'RE NOT AWARE OF THEM WELL
DanDennett_2003@606.48:614.65 EARLIER TODAY JEFF HAWKINS MENTIONED THE WAY YOUR EYE SACCADES THE WAY YOUR EYE MOVES AROUND THREE OR FOUR TIMES A SECOND HE DIDN'T MENTION THE SPEED
DanDennett_2003@614.78:623.19 YOUR EYE IS CONSTANTLY IN MOTION MOVING AROUND LOOKING AT EYES NOSES ELBOWS LOOKING AT INTERESTING THINGS IN THE WORLD AND WHERE YOUR EYE ISN'T LOOKING
DanDennett_2003@623.51:629.04 YOU'RE REMARKABLY IMPOVERISHED IN YOUR VISION THAT'S BECAUSE THE FOVEAL PART OF YOUR
DanDennett_2003@629.75:635.77 WHICH IS THE HIGH RESOLUTION PART IS ONLY ABOUT THE SIZE OF YOUR THUMBNAIL HELD AT ARMS LENGTH THAT'S THE DETAIL PART
DanDennett_2003@636.97:644.48 IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT WAY DOES IT IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT WAY BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT IS YOU'RE GETTING IN A LOT LESS INFORMATION THAN YOU THINK
DanDennett_2003@654.24:660.65 A STUDENT OF CANALETTO 'S AND I LOVE PAINTINGS LIKE THAT THE PAINTING IS ACTUALLY ABOUT AS BIG AS IT IS RIGHT HERE
DanDennett_2003@661.09:672.91 I LOVE CANALETTOS BECAUSE CANALETTO HAS THIS FANTASTIC DETAIL AND YOU CAN GET RIGHT UP AND SEE ALL THE DETAILS ON THE PAINTING AND I STARTED ACROSS THE HALL
DanDennett_2003@673.57:681.34 IN NORTH CAROLINA BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS PROBABLY A CANALETTO AND WOULD HAVE ALL THAT IN DETAIL AND I NOTICED THAT ON THE BRIDGE THERE
DanDennett_2003@689.60:698.74 SEE THEIR CLOTHES AND SO FORTH AND AS I GOT CLOSER AND CLOSER I ACTUALLY SCREAMED I YELLED OUT BECAUSE WHEN I GOT CLOSER I FOUND THE DETAIL WASN'T THERE AT ALL
DanDennett_2003@701.54:711.14 LITTLE ARTFULLY PLACED BLOBS OF PAINT AND AS I WALKED TOWARDS THE PICTURE I WAS EXPECTING DETAIL THAT WASN'T THERE
DanDennett_2003@711.76:721.13 THE ARTIST HAD VERY CLEVERLY SUGGESTED PEOPLE AND CLOTHES AND WAGONS AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS AND MY BRAIN HAD TAKEN THE SUGGESTION
DanDennett_2003@722.80:734.35 YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH A MORE RECENT TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS THERE YOU CAN GET A BETTER VIEW OF THE BLOBS SEE WHEN YOU GET CLOSE THEY'RE REALLY JUST BLOBS OF PAINT
DanDennett_2003@737.73:742.88 YOU WILL HAVE SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS THIS IS THE REVERSE EFFECT
DanDennett_2003@752.04:760.73 THAT TO YOU ONE MORE TIME NOW WHAT DOES YOUR BRAIN DO WHEN IT TAKES THE SUGGESTION
DanDennett_2003@761.53:771.65 WHEN AN ARTFUL BLOB OF PAINT OR TWO BY AN ARTIST SUGGESTS A PERSON SAY ONE OF
DanDennett_2003@778.91:783.11 I DON'T THINK SO NOT A CHANCE BUT THEN HOW ON EARTH IS IT
DanDennett_2003@784.61:786.28 WELL
DanDennett_2003@786.68:793.89 REMEMBER THE PHILOSOPHER 'S EXPLANATION OF THE LADY IT'S THE SAME THING THE BRAIN JUST MAKES YOU THINK
DanDennett_2003@794.41:802.39 THAT IT'S GOT THE DETAIL THERE YOU THINK THE DETAIL 'S THERE BUT IT ISN'T THERE THE BRAIN ISN'T ACTUALLY PUTTING THE DETAIL IN YOUR HEAD AT ALL IT'S JUST MAKING YOU EXPECT THE
DanDennett_2003@804.37:812.28 LET 'S JUST DO THIS EXPERIMENT VERY QUICKLY IS THE SHAPE ON THE LEFT THE SAME AS THE SHAPE ON THE RIGHT ROTATED
DanDennett_2003@813.56:820.79 YES HOW MANY OF YOU DID IT BY ROTATING THE ONE ON THE LEFT IN YOUR MIND 'S EYE TO SEE IF IT MATCHED UP WITH THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HOW MANY OF YOU ROTATED THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
DanDennett_2003@821.78:824.86 OK HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU DID
DanDennett_2003@829.01:838.68 IN FACT BEEN A VERY INTERESTING DEBATE RAGING FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE VARIOUS EXPERIMENTS STARTED BY ROGER SHEPHERD WHO MEASURED THE ANGULAR VELOCITY OF ROTATION OF MENTAL
DanDennett_2003@840.91:849.94 YES IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO THAT BUT THE DETAILS OF THE PROCESS ARE STILL IN SIGNIFICANT CONTROVERSY AND
DanDennett_2003@850.59:861.90 IF YOU READ THAT LITERATURE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU REALLY HAVE TO COME TO TERMS WITH IS EVEN WHEN YOU'RE THE SUBJECT IN THE EXPERIMENT YOU DON'T KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT YOU JUST KNOW THAT YOU HAVE CERTAIN BELIEFS
DanDennett_2003@871.78:879.74 THIS IS A FIGURE THAT I LOVE BRADLEY PETRIE AND DUMAIS YOU MAY THINK THAT I'VE CHEATED THAT I'VE PUT A LITTLE
DanDennett_2003@880.36:889.45 WHITER THAN WHITE BOUNDARY THERE HOW MANY OF YOU SEE THAT SORT OF BOUNDARY WITH THE NECKER CUBE FLOATING IN FRONT OF THE CIRCLES CAN YOU SEE IT
DanDennett_2003@890.22:898.32 WELL YOU KNOW IN EFFECT THE BOUNDARY 'S REALLY THERE IN A CERTAIN SENSE YOUR BRAIN IS ACTUALLY COMPUTING THAT BOUNDARY THE BOUNDARY
DanDennett_2003@898.54:913.14 THAT GOES RIGHT THERE BUT NOW NOTICE THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF SEEING THE CUBE RIGHT IT'S A NECKER CUBE EVERYBODY CAN SEE THE TWO WAYS OF SEEING THE CUBE OK CAN YOU SEE THE FOUR WAYS OF SEEING THE CUBE
DanDennett_2003@937.69:947.12 NOW YOU CAN GET IT THESE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT PHENOMENA WHEN YOU SEE THE CUBE ONE WAY BEHIND THE SCREEN
DanDennett_2003@948.28:958.34 THOSE BOUNDARIES GO AWAY BUT THERE'S STILL A SORT OF FILLING IN AS WE CAN TELL IF WE LOOK AT THIS WE DON'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE SEEING THE CUBE BUT WHERE DOES THE COLOR CHANGE
DanDennett_2003@966.13:970.34 THE CURTAIN NO YOUR BRAIN JUST LETS IT GO THE BRAIN DOESN'T NEED
DanDennett_2003@977.20:979.67 WHEN I FIRST STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE BRADLEY
DanDennett_2003@987.34:988.70 I SAID
DanDennett_2003@1002.32:1011.22 NOW IF YOU THINK YOU SEE SOME PALE YELLOW I'LL RUN THIS A FEW MORE TIMES LOOK IN THE GRAY
DanDennett_2003@1012.55:1017.39 AREAS AND SEE IF YOU SEEM TO SEE SOMETHING SORT OF SHADOWY MOVING IN THERE
DanDennett_2003@1021.16:1023.66 IT'S AMAZING THERE'S NOTHING THERE IT'S NO TRICK
DanDennett_2003@1031.19:1043.28 THIS IS RON RENSINK 'S WORK WHICH WAS IN SOME DEGREE INSPIRED BY THAT SUGGESTION RIGHT AT THE END OF THE BOOK LET ME JUST PAUSE THIS FOR A SECOND IF I CAN THIS IS CHANGE BLINDNESS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IS TWO PICTURES
DanDennett_2003@1052.45:1060.59 FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF A SECOND SO YOU'LL SEE THE FIRST PICTURE THEN A MASK THEN THE SECOND PICTURE THEN A MASK AND THIS WILL JUST CONTINUE
DanDennett_2003@1061.48:1069.52 AND YOUR JOB AS THE SUBJECT IS TO PRESS THE BUTTON WHEN YOU SEE THE CHANGE SO SHOW THE ORIGINAL PICTURE FOR TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLISECONDS
DanDennett_2003@1072.00:1082.51 BLANK SHOW THE NEXT PICTURE FOR TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLISECONDS BLANK AND KEEP GOING UNTIL THE SUBJECT
DanDennett_2003@1092.39:1092.69 TO
DanDennett_2003@1097.05:1108.21 NO TROUBLE THERE CAN EVERYBODY SEE ALL RIGHT INDEED RENSINK 'S SUBJECTS TOOK ONLY A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN A SECOND TO PRESS THE BUTTON
DanDennett_2003@1113.60:1113.97 THAT ONE
DanDennett_2003@1122.45:1122.96 TWO POINT
DanDennett_2003@1173.44:1174.86 IS IT A BRIDGE OR A
DanDennett_2003@1191.92:1197.94 AND YET IT'S PRETTY HARD TO SEE CAN YOU SEE IT
DanDennett_2003@1199.32:1202.89 SEE THE SHADOWS GOING BACK AND FORTH PRETTY BIG
DanDennett_2003@1210.67:1223.34 SO FIFTEEN AND A HALF SECONDS IS THE MEDIAN TIME FOR SUBJECTS IN HIS EXPERIMENT THERE I LOVE THIS ONE I'LL END WITH THIS ONE JUST BECAUSE IT'S SUCH AN OBVIOUS AND IMPORTANT THING
DanDennett_2003@1224.94:1226.23 HOW MANY STILL DON'T SEE IT
DanDennett_2003@1228.63:1232.84 SEE IT HOW MANY ENGINES ON THE WING OF THAT BOEING
DanDennett_2003@1234.46:1236.92 RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PICTURE
DanDennett_2003@1240.33:1249.64 THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION WHAT I WANTED TO SHOW YOU IS THAT SCIENTISTS USING THEIR FROM THE OUTSIDE THIRD PERSON METHODS
DanDennett_2003@1264.38:1274.95 WAS DESCRIBING HIS ATTEMPT TO GET THEORY AND A GOOD BIG THEORY INTO THE NEUROSCIENCE AND HE 'S RIGHT THIS IS A PROBLEM
DanDennett_2003@1294.63:1298.90 WE HAVE TO HAVE MORE THEORY AND IT CAN COME AS MUCH FROM THE TOP DOWN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
