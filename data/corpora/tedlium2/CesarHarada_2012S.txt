CesarHarada_2012S@17.41:26.74 IS THE COMMON POINT BETWEEN OIL PLASTIC AND RADIOACTIVITY
CesarHarada_2012S@26.74:44.59 ON THE TOP LINE THIS IS THE BP OIL SPILL BILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL GUSHING IN THE GULF OF MEXICO THE MIDDLE LINE IS MILLIONS OF TONS OF PLASTIC DEBRIS ACCUMULATING IN OUR OCEAN AND THE THIRD LINE IS RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL LEAKING FROM FUKUSHIMA NUCLEAR POWER PLANT IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN
CesarHarada_2012S@54.22:68.56 THIS SHOULD MAKE US FEEL VERY TERRIBLY AWFUL AS MUCH AS IT SHOULD MAKE US FEEL HOPEFUL BECAUSE IF WE HAVE THE POWER TO CREATE THESE PROBLEMS WE MAY AS WELL HAVE THE POWER TO REMEDIATE THESE PROBLEMS BUT WHAT ABOUT NATURAL FORCES
CesarHarada_2012S@68.56:85.05 WELL THAT 'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS HOW WE CAN USE THESE NATURAL FORCES TO REMEDIATE THESE MAN MADE PROBLEMS WHEN THE BP OIL SPILL HAPPENED I WAS WORKING AT MIT AND I WAS IN CHARGE OF DEVELOPING AN OIL SPILL CLEANING TECHNOLOGY
CesarHarada_2012S@85.05:89.89 AND I HAD A CHANCE TO GO IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND MEET SOME FISHERMEN
CesarHarada_2012S@89.89:106.05 AND SEE THE TERRIBLE CONDITIONS IN WHICH THEY WERE WORKING MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED OF THESE BOATS WHICH ARE FISHERMEN BOATS REPURPOSED WITH OIL ABSORBENT IN WHITE AND OIL CONTAINMENT IN ORANGE WERE USED BUT THEY ONLY COLLECTED THREE PERCENT OF THE OIL ON THE SURFACE
CesarHarada_2012S@122.67:133.33 SO I WANTED TO DEVELOP SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DEVELOP VERY FAST THAT WOULD BE CHEAP AND THAT WOULD BE OPEN SOURCE SO BECAUSE OIL SPILLS ARE NOT ONLY HAPPENING IN THE GULF OF MEXICO
CesarHarada_2012S@142.85:159.84 CURRENTLY WHAT THEY WERE DOING IS THAT THEY WERE USING THESE SMALL FISHING BOATS AND THEY WERE CLEANING CLEAN LINES IN AN OCEAN OF DIRT IF YOU 'RE USING THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF SURFACE OF OIL ABSORBENT BUT YOU 'RE JUST PAYING ATTENTION TO NATURAL PATTERNS AND IF YOU 'RE GOING UP THE WINDS YOU CAN COLLECT A LOT MORE MATERIAL
CesarHarada_2012S@159.84:171.5 IF YOU 'RE MULTIPLYING THE RIG SO YOU MULTIPLY HOW MANY LAYERS OF ABSORBENT YOU 'RE USING YOU CAN COLLECT A LOT MORE BUT IT 'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO MOVE OIL ABSORBENT AGAINST THE WINDS THE SURFACE CURRENTS
CesarHarada_2012S@171.5:183.2 AND THE WAVES THESE ARE ENORMOUS FORCES SO THE VERY SIMPLE IDEA WAS TO USE THE ANCIENT TECHNIQUE OF SAILING AND TACKING OF THE WIND TO CAPTURE OR INTERCEPT THE OIL THAT IS DRIFTING DOWN THE WIND
CesarHarada_2012S@183.2:195.87 SO THIS DIDN 'T REQUIRE ANY INVENTION WE JUST TOOK A SIMPLE SAILING BOAT AND WE TRIED TO PULL SOMETHING LONG AND HEAVY BUT AS WE TACKED BACK AND FORTH WHAT WE LOST WAS TWO THINGS WE WERE LOSING PULLING POWER
CesarHarada_2012S@219.22:236.82 THEN I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I KEPT PLAYING WITH THE ROBOT AND SO YOU SEE THE ROBOT HAS A FRONT RUDDER HERE NORMALLY IT 'S AT THE BACK AND PLAYING I REALIZED THAT THE MANEUVERABILITY OF THIS WAS REALLY AMAZING AND I COULD AVOID AN OBSTACLE AT THE VERY LAST SECOND MORE MANEUVERABLE THAN A NORMAL BOAT
CesarHarada_2012S@270.55:290.21 AND THE PROPERTIES OF SAILING THAT WE GET ARE VERY SUPERIOR COMPARED TO A NORMAL BOAT WHEN WE 'RE TURNING WE HAVE THE FEELING OF SURFING AND THE WAY IT 'S GOING UP WIND IT 'S VERY EFFICIENT THIS IS LOW SPEED LOW WIND SPEED AND THE MANEUVERABILITY IS VERY INCREASED AND HERE I 'M GOING TO DO A SMALL JIBE
CesarHarada_2012S@290.21:301.52 AND LOOK AT THE POSITION OF THE SAIL WHAT 'S HAPPENING IS THAT BECAUSE THE BOAT CHANGES SHAPE THE POSITION OF THE FRONT SAIL AND THE MAIN SAIL ARE DIFFERENT TO THE WIND WE 'RE CATCHING WIND FROM BOTH SIDES
CesarHarada_2012S@301.52:307.99 AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE 'RE LOOKING FOR IF WE WANT TO PULL SOMETHING LONG AND HEAVY WE DON 'T WANT TO LOSE PULLING POWER NOR DIRECTION
CesarHarada_2012S@376.98:387.13 SO WHAT WE ARE DOING IS AN ACCELERATED EVOLUTION OF SAILING TECHNOLOGY WE WENT FROM A BACK RUDDER TO A FRONT RUDDER TO TWO RUDDERS TO MULTIPLE RUDDERS TO THE WHOLE BOAT CHANGING SHAPE
CesarHarada_2012S@410.4:418.83 SO I BROUGHT TO YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE TED STAGE PROTEI NUMBER EIGHT IT 'S NOT THE LAST ONE BUT IT 'S A GOOD ONE FOR MAKING DEMOS
CesarHarada_2012S@448.66:463.45 AND YOU 'RE PUTTING VERTICAL YOU 'RE BENDING AND IF YOU 'RE MOVING THIS WAY FORWARD YOUR INSTINCT WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU MIGHT GO THIS WAY BUT IF YOU 'RE MOVING FAST ENOUGH YOU MIGHT CREATE WHAT WE CALL LATERAL LIFT SO WE COULD GET FURTHER OR CLOSER TO THE WIND
CesarHarada_2012S@463.45:470.8 OTHER PROPERTY IS THIS A NORMAL SAILING BOAT HAS A CENTERBOARD HERE AND A RUDDER AT THE BACK
CesarHarada_2012S@470.8:485.44 AND THESE TWO THINGS ARE WHAT CREATES MOST RESISTANCE AND TURBULENCE BEHIND THE BOAT BUT BECAUSE THIS DOESN 'T HAVE EITHER A CENTERBOARD OR A RUDDER WE HOPE THAT IF WE KEEP WORKING ON THIS HULL DESIGN WE CAN IMPROVE AND HAVE LESS RESISTANCE
CesarHarada_2012S@485.44:494.76 THE OTHER THING IS MOST BOATS WHEN THEY REACH A CERTAIN SPEED AND THEY ARE GOING ON WAVES THEY START TO HIT AND SLAP ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND A LOT OF THE ENERGY MOVING FORWARD
CesarHarada_2012S@494.76:511.66 IS LOST BUT IF WE 'RE GOING WITH THE FLOW IF WE PAY ATTENTION TO NATURAL PATTERNS INSTEAD OF TRYING TO BE STRONG BUT IF YOU 'RE GOING WITH THE FLOW WE MAY ABSORB A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL NOISES SO THE WAVE ENERGY TO ACTUALLY SAVE SOME ENERGY TO MOVE FORWARD
CesarHarada_2012S@545.04:553.78 WHAT WE REALLY WANT IS THAT THIS INNOVATION HAPPENS CONTINUOUSLY THE INVENTOR AND ENGINEERS AND ALSO THE MANUFACTURERS AND EVERYBODY WORKS AT THE SAME TIME
CesarHarada_2012S@553.78:571.06 BUT THIS WOULD BE STERILE IF THIS WAS HAPPENING IN A PARALLEL AND UNCROSSED PROCESS WHAT YOU REALLY WANT IS NOT A SEQUENTIAL NOT PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT YOU WANT TO HAVE A NETWORK OF INNOVATION YOU WANT EVERYBODY LIKE WE 'RE DOING NOW TO WORK AT THE SAME TIME AND THAT CAN ONLY HAPPEN IF THESE PEOPLE ALL TOGETHER DECIDE
CesarHarada_2012S@583.45:589.51 SO WHAT IS OPEN HARDWARE ESSENTIALLY OPEN HARDWARE IS A LICENSE IT 'S JUST AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SETUP
CesarHarada_2012S@604.47:616.97 AND I STARTED THIS PROJECT ALONE IN A GARAGE IN NEW ORLEANS BUT QUICKLY AFTER I WANTED TO PUBLISH AND SHARE THIS INFORMATION SO I MADE A KICKSTARTER WHICH IS A CROWD FUNDRAISING PLATFORM AND IN ABOUT ONE MONTH WE FUNDRAISED THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
CesarHarada_2012S@616.97:629.62 WITH THIS MONEY I HIRED A TEAM OF YOUNG ENGINEERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD AND WE RENTED A FACTORY IN ROTTERDAM IN THE NETHERLANDS WE WERE PEER LEARNING WE WERE ENGINEERING WE WERE MAKING THINGS
CesarHarada_2012S@637.71:644.92 THIS IS A PROUD MEMBER OF PROTEI FROM KOREA AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE THIS IS A MULTIPLE MASTS DESIGN PROPOSED BY A TEAM IN MEXICO
CesarHarada_2012S@644.92:654.41 THIS IDEA REALLY APPEALED TO GABRIELLA LEVINE IN NEW YORK AND SO SHE DECIDED TO PROTOTYPE THIS IDEA THAT SHE SAW AND SHE DOCUMENTED EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS
CesarHarada_2012S@674.73:679.57 WE 'RE WORKING ON ALSO SIMPLER TECHNOLOGY NOT THAT COMPLEX WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE
CesarHarada_2012S@692.5:712.47 AND WHAT PUTS US TOGETHER IS THAT WE HAVE A COMMON AT LEAST GLOBAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE WORD BUSINESS IS OR WHAT IT SHOULD BE THIS IS HOW MOST WORK TODAY BUSINESS AS USUAL IS SAYING WHAT 'S MOST IMPORTANT IS TO MAKE LOTS OF PROFIT AND YOU 'LL BE USING TECHNOLOGY FOR THAT AND PEOPLE WILL BE YOUR WORK FORCE INSTRUMENTALIZED
CesarHarada_2012S@712.47:728.23 AND ENVIRONMENT IS USUALLY THE LAST PRIORITY IT WILL BE JUST A WAY TO SAY GREENWASH YOUR AUDIENCE AND SAY INCREASE YOUR PRICE TAG WHAT WE 'RE TRYING TO DO OR WHAT WE BELIEVE BECAUSE THIS IS HOW WE BELIEVE THE WORLD REALLY WORKS IS THAT WITHOUT THE ENVIRONMENT YOU HAVE NOTHING
CesarHarada_2012S@757.7:777.31 WHAT 'S NEXT FOR US SO THIS SMALL MACHINE THAT YOU 'VE SEEN WE 'RE HOPING TO MAKE SMALL TOYS LIKE ONE METER REMOTE CONTROL PROTEI THAT YOU CAN UPGRADE SO REPLACE THE REMOTE CONTROL PARTS BY ANDROIDS SO THE MOBILE PHONE AND ARDUINO MICRO CONTROLLER SO YOU COULD BE CONTROLLING THIS FROM YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOUR TABLET
CesarHarada_2012S@777.31:795.49 THEN WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS CREATE SIX METER VERSIONS SO WE CAN TEST THE MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE OF THESE MACHINES SO WE CAN GO AT VERY VERY HIGH SPEED SO IMAGINE YOURSELF YOU ARE LAYING DOWN IN A FLEXIBLE TORPEDO SAILING AT HIGH SPEED CONTROLLING THE SHAPE OF THE HULL WITH YOUR LEGS AND CONTROLLING THE SAIL WITH YOUR ARMS SO THAT 'S
CesarHarada_2012S@809.22:817.01 THIS IS WHAT OUR TEAMMATES WE DREAM OF AT NIGHT WE HOPE THAT WE CAN SOMETIME CLEAN UP OIL SPILLS OR WE CAN
CesarHarada_2012S@817.01:829.71 GATHER OR COLLECT PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN OR WE CAN HAVE SWARMS OF OUR MACHINES CONTROLLED BY MULTI PLAYER VIDEO GAME ENGINES TO CONTROL MANY OF THESE MACHINES TO MONITOR CORAL REEFS
CesarHarada_2012S@829.71:834.3 OR TO MONITOR FISHERIES OUR HOPE IS THAT
CesarHarada_2012S@834.3:841.09 WE CAN USE OPEN HARDWARE TECHNOLOGY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND PROTECT OUR OCEANS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
