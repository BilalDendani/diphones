JohannaBlakley_2009X I HEARD THIS AMAZING STORY ABOUT MIUCCIA PRADA SHE'S AN ITALIAN FASHION DESIGNER SHE GOES TO THIS VINTAGE STORE IN PARIS WITH A FRIEND OF HERS SHE'S ROOTING AROUND SHE FINDS THIS ONE JACKET
JohannaBlakley_2009X TURNING IT INSIDE OUT SHE'S LOOKING AT THE SEAMS SHE'S LOOKING AT THE CONSTRUCTION HER FRIEND SAYS BUY IT ALREADY
JohannaBlakley_2009X BUT I'M ALSO GOING TO REPLICATE IT
JohannaBlakley_2009X NOW THE ACADEMICS IN THIS AUDIENCE MAY THINK WELL THAT SOUNDS LIKE PLAGIARISM
JohannaBlakley_2009X BUT TO A FASHIONISTA WHAT IT REALLY IS IS A SIGN PRADA 'S GENIUS THAT SHE CAN ROOT THROUGH THE HISTORY OF FASHION AND PICK THE ONE JACKET THAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE CHANGED BY ONE IOTA AND TO BE CURRENT AND TO BE NOW
JohannaBlakley_2009X YOU MIGHT ALSO BE ASKING WHETHER IT'S POSSIBLE
JohannaBlakley_2009X THAT THIS IS ILLEGAL FOR HER TO DO THIS
JohannaBlakley_2009X THEY HAVE TRADEMARK PROTECTION
JohannaBlakley_2009X AND SO IT MEANS THAT ANYBODY COULD COPY ANY GARMENT ON ANY PERSON IN THIS ROOM
JohannaBlakley_2009X AND SELL IT AS THEIR OWN DESIGN
JohannaBlakley_2009X BUT IF YOU GO TO SANTEE ALLEY YEAH
JohannaBlakley_2009X IS VIVIENNE WESTWOOD NO WE THINK OF IT AS MAYBE TOO SILLY TOO UNNECESSARY NOW
JohannaBlakley_2009X ARGUE TODAY IS THAT BECAUSE THERE IS NO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY
JohannaBlakley_2009X FASHION DESIGNERS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO ELEVATE UTILITARIAN DESIGN THINGS TO COVER OUR NAKED BODIES INTO SOMETHING WE CONSIDER ART
JohannaBlakley_2009X BECAUSE THERE'S NO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION IN THIS INDUSTRY THERE'S A VERY OPEN AND CREATIVE ECOLOGY OF CREATIVITY
JohannaBlakley_2009X THEY CAN TAKE ANY ELEMENT FROM ANY GARMENT FROM THE HISTORY OF FASHION AND INCORPORATE IT INTO THEIR OWN DESIGN THEY'RE ALSO NOTORIOUS FOR YOU KNOW RIFFING OFF OF THE ZEITGEIST AND HERE I
JohannaBlakley_2009X CAN'T COPYRIGHT A COSTUME EITHER
JohannaBlakley_2009X NOW FASHION DESIGNERS HAVE THE BROADEST PALETTE IMAGINABLE IN THIS CREATIVE INDUSTRY THIS WEDDING DRESS HERE IS ACTUALLY MADE OF SPORKS AND THIS DRESS IS ACTUALLY MADE OF ALUMINUM
JohannaBlakley_2009X I'VE HEARD THIS DRESS ACTUALLY SORT OF SOUNDS LIKE WIND CHIMES AS THEY WALK THROUGH SO ONE OF THE MAGICAL SIDE EFFECTS
JohannaBlakley_2009X OF HAVING A CULTURE OF COPYING WHICH IS REALLY WHAT IT IS IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TRENDS PEOPLE THINK THIS IS A MAGICAL THING HOW DOES IT HAPPEN WELL IT'S BECAUSE IT'S LEGAL FOR PEOPLE TO COPY ONE ANOTHER
JohannaBlakley_2009X SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF THE FASHION FOOD CHAIN WHO SORT OF DICTATE TO US WHAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO WEAR
JohannaBlakley_2009X BUT IF YOU TALK TO ANY DESIGNER AT ANY LEVEL INCLUDING THESE HIGH END DESIGNERS THEY ALWAYS SAY THEIR MAIN INSPIRATION COMES FROM THE STREET WHERE PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME REMIX AND MATCH OUR OWN FASHION LOOKS
JohannaBlakley_2009X AND THAT'S WHERE THEY REALLY GET A LOT OF THEIR CREATIVE INSPIRATION
JohannaBlakley_2009X FASHION GIANTS HAVE PROBABLY BENEFITED THE MOST FROM THE LACK OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTION IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY THEY ARE NOTORIOUS FOR KNOCKING OFF HIGH END DESIGNS AND SELLING THEM AT VERY LOW PRICES AND THEY'VE BEEN FACED WITH A LOT OF
JohannaBlakley_2009X BUT THOSE LAWSUITS ARE USUALLY NOT WON BY FASHION DESIGNERS THE COURTS HAVE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN YOU DON'T NEED ANY MORE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION
JohannaBlakley_2009X WHEN YOU LOOK AT COPIES LIKE THIS IT'S LIKE YOU WONDER HOW DO THE LUXURY HIGH END BRANDS REMAIN IN BUSINESS IF YOU CAN GET IT FOR TWO HUNDRED BUCKS WHY PAY A THOUSAND
JohannaBlakley_2009X AND WE ASKED HIM EXACTLY THIS QUESTION HERE 'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY HE HAD JUST COME OFF A SUCCESSFUL STINT AS THE LEAD DESIGNER AT GUCCI IN
JohannaBlakley_2009X THE PEOPLE ON SANTEE ALLEY ARE NOT THE ONES WHO
JohannaBlakley_2009X YOU KNOW A KNOCK OFF IS NEVER THE SAME
JohannaBlakley_2009X AS AN ORIGINAL HIGH END DESIGN AT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE MATERIALS THEY'RE ALWAYS MADE OF CHEAPER MATERIALS BUT EVEN SOMETIMES A CHEAPER VERSION CAN ACTUALLY HAVE SOME
JohannaBlakley_2009X PALETTE OF DESIGN CHOICES TO CHOOSE FROM THAN WE EVER HAVE BEFORE AND THIS IS MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE FAST FASHION INDUSTRY ACTUALLY
JohannaBlakley_2009X FASHIONABLE EVERY SEASON THESE DESIGNERS HAVE TO STRUGGLE TO COME UP WITH THE NEW FABULOUS IDEA THAT EVERYBODY 'S GOING TO LOVE AND THIS LET ME TELL YOU IS VERY GOOD FOR THE BOTTOM LINE
JohannaBlakley_2009X NOW OF COURSE THERE'S A BUNCH OF EFFECTS THAT THIS CULTURE OF COPYING HAS ON THE CREATIVE PROCESS AND STUART WEITZMAN IS A VERY SUCCESSFUL SHOE DESIGNER HE HAS COMPLAINED A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE COPYING HIM BUT IN ONE INTERVIEW I READ
JohannaBlakley_2009X HE SAID YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY FORCED HIM TO UP HIS GAME HE HAD TO COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS NEW THINGS THAT WOULD BE HARD TO COPY HE CAME UP WITH THIS BOWDEN WEDGE HEEL
JohannaBlakley_2009X HEARD THIS ANECDOTE BUT I HAVE
JohannaBlakley_2009X THIS IS NOT UNLIKE THE WORLD OF COMEDY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THAT JOKES ALSO CAN'T BE COPYRIGHT
JohannaBlakley_2009X SO WHEN ONE LINERS WERE REALLY POPULAR
JohannaBlakley_2009X FUNNY NOW THE OTHER THING THAT FASHION DESIGNERS HAVE DONE TO SURVIVE IN THIS CULTURE OF COPYING IS THEY'VE LEARNED HOW TO COPY THEMSELVES
JohannaBlakley_2009X NOW SOME FASHION DESIGNERS WILL SAY IT 'S ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY RESPECT IN OTHER COUNTRIES THERE IS PROTECTION FOR OUR ARTFUL DESIGNS BUT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE TWO OTHER BIGGEST MARKETS IN THE WORLD IT TURNS OUT THAT THE
JohannaBlakley_2009X IN JAPAN FOR INSTANCE WHICH I THINK IS THE THIRD LARGEST MARKET THEY HAVE A DESIGN LAW IT PROTECTS APPAREL
JohannaBlakley_2009X BUT THE NOVELTY STANDARD IS SO HIGH YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT YOUR GARMENT
JohannaBlakley_2009X IT'S TOTALLY UNIQUE AND THAT'S SORT OF LIKE THE NOVELTY STANDARD FOR A U S PATENT WHICH FASHION DESIGNERS NEVER GET RARELY GET HERE IN THE STATES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THEY WENT IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
JohannaBlakley_2009X VERY LOW NOVELTY STANDARD ANYBODY CAN REGISTER ANYTHING BUT EVEN THOUGH IT'S THE HOME OF THE FAST FASHION INDUSTRY AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF LUXURY DESIGNERS THERE
JohannaBlakley_2009X THEY DON'T REGISTER THEIR GARMENTS GENERALLY AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF LITIGATION
JohannaBlakley_2009X IT TURNS OUT IT'S BECAUSE THE NOVELTY STANDARD IS TOO LOW A PERSON CAN COME IN AND TAKE SOMEBODY
JohannaBlakley_2009X CUT OFF THREE INCHES FROM THE BOTTOM GO TO THE E U AND REGISTER IT AS A NEW ORIGINAL DESIGN
JohannaBlakley_2009X SO THAT DOES NOT STOP THE KNOCK OFF ARTISTS IF YOU LOOK AT THE REGISTRY ACTUALLY A LOT OF THE REGISTERED THINGS IN THE E U ARE NIKE T SHIRTS THAT ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL TO ONE ANOTHER
JohannaBlakley_2009X THE RETAILERS HAVE KIND OF QUASHED THIS NOTION THOUGH I DON'T THINK THE LEGISLATION IS GOING ANYWHERE BECAUSE THEY REALIZE IT IS SO HARD TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PIRATED DESIGN
JohannaBlakley_2009X AND SOMETHING THAT'S JUST PART OF A GLOBAL TREND
JohannaBlakley_2009X WHO OWNS A LOOK
JohannaBlakley_2009X VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER IT TAKES LOTS OF LAWYERS AND LOTS OF COURT TIME AND THE RETAILERS DECIDED THAT WOULD BE WAY TOO EXPENSIVE
JohannaBlakley_2009X YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST THE FASHION INDUSTRY THAT DOESN'T HAVE COPYRIGHT PROTECTION
JohannaBlakley_2009X OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT DON'T HAVE COPYRIGHT PROTECTION INCLUDING THE FOOD INDUSTRY YOU CANNOT COPYRIGHT A RECIPE BECAUSE IT'S A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS IT'S FACT AND YOU CANNOT COPYRIGHT THE LOOK AND FEEL OF EVEN THE MOST UNIQUE
JohannaBlakley_2009X SAME WITH AUTOMOBILES IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW WACKY THEY LOOK OR HOW COOL THEY LOOK YOU CANNOT COPYRIGHT THE SCULPTURAL DESIGN
JohannaBlakley_2009X IT'S A UTILITARIAN ARTICLE THAT'S WHY
JohannaBlakley_2009X SAME WITH FURNITURE IT'S TOO UTILITARIAN
JohannaBlakley_2009X OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE THESE GUYS DECIDED THEY DIDN'T WANT COPYRIGHT PROTECTION
JohannaBlakley_2009X BE MORE INNOVATIVE WITHOUT IT
JohannaBlakley_2009X JOKES NO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION FIREWORKS DISPLAYS THE RULES OF GAMES
JohannaBlakley_2009X AND SOME OF THESE INDUSTRIES MAY SEEM SORT OF MARGINAL TO YOU
JohannaBlakley_2009X BUT THESE ARE THE GROSS SALES FOR LOW I P INDUSTRIES INDUSTRIES WITH VERY LITTLE COPYRIGHT PROTECTION AND
JohannaBlakley_2009X IT AIN'T PRETTY
JohannaBlakley_2009X YOU TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY AND THEY'RE LIKE
JohannaBlakley_2009X ANYBODY WE CAN ACTUALLY STEAL FROM EACH OTHER 'S
JohannaBlakley_2009X BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S REVOLUTIONARY AND IT'S A MODEL THAT A LOT OF OTHER INDUSTRIES LIKE THE ONES WE JUST SAW WITH THE REALLY SMALL BARS
JohannaBlakley_2009X THEY MIGHT HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THOSE INDUSTRIES WITH A LOT OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTION ARE OPERATING IN AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE IT'S AS IF THEY DON'T HAVE ANY PROTECTION AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
JohannaBlakley_2009X WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF INDUSTRIES THAT DIDN'T HAVE COPYRIGHT PROTECTION
JohannaBlakley_2009X IS THE UNDERLYING LOGIC I WANT A PICTURE AND THE LAWYERS DO NOT PROVIDE A PICTURE SO I MADE ONE
JohannaBlakley_2009X THESE ARE THE TWO MAIN SORT OF BINARY OPPOSITIONS WITHIN THE LOGIC OF COPYRIGHT LAW IT IS MORE COMPLEX THAN THIS BUT THIS WILL DO FIRST IS SOMETHING AN ARTISTIC OBJECT THEN IT DESERVES PROTECTION
JohannaBlakley_2009X IS IT A UTILITARIAN OBJECT THEN NO IT DOES NOT DESERVE PROTECTION THIS IS A DIFFICULT UNSTABLE BINARY THE OTHER ONE IS IS IT AN IDEA IS IT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO FREELY CIRCULATE IN A FREE SOCIETY
JohannaBlakley_2009X OR IS IT A PHYSICALLY FIXED EXPRESSION OF AN IDEA SOMETHING THAT SOMEBODY MADE AND THEY DESERVE TO OWN IT FOR A WHILE AND MAKE MONEY FROM IT
JohannaBlakley_2009X THAT DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY HAS COMPLETELY SUBVERTED THE LOGIC OF THIS PHYSICALLY FIXED EXPRESSION VERSUS IDEA
JohannaBlakley_2009X NOWADAYS WE
JohannaBlakley_2009X NOW THE CONCEPTUAL ISSUES ARE
JohannaBlakley_2009X WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CREATIVITY AND OWNERSHIP
JohannaBlakley_2009X AND LET ME TELL YOU WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THIS JUST TO LAWYERS TO FIGURE OUT THEY'RE SMART
JohannaBlakley_2009X IN A DIGITAL WORLD THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO THE MOST INNOVATION AND MY SUGGESTION IS THAT FASHION MIGHT BE A REALLY GOOD PLACE TO START LOOKING FOR A MODEL FOR CREATIVE INDUSTRIES IN THE FUTURE
JohannaBlakley_2009X IF YOU WANT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS RESEARCH PROJECT
JohannaBlakley_2009X AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK VERONICA JAURIQUI FOR MAKING THIS VERY FASHIONABLE PRESENTATION
