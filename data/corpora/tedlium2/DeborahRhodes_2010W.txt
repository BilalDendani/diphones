DeborahRhodes_2010W@16.34:29.19 THERE ARE TWO GROUPS OF WOMEN WHEN IT COMES TO SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY WOMEN IN WHOM MAMMOGRAPHY WORKS VERY WELL AND HAS SAVED THOUSANDS OF LIVES AND WOMEN IN WHOM IT DOESN'T WORK WELL AT ALL
DeborahRhodes_2010W@32.78:34.83 IF YOU DON 'T YOU'RE NOT ALONE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@35.31:38.91 BECAUSE THE BREAST HAS BECOME ARE VERY POLITICAL ORGAN
DeborahRhodes_2010W@40.11:44.44 THE TRUTH HAS BECOME LOST IN ALL THE RHETORIC COMING FROM THE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@50.31:54.21 I WILL DO MY BEST THIS MORNING TO TELL YOU WHAT I THINK IS THE TRUTH
DeborahRhodes_2010W@55.16:59.61 BUT FIRST MY DISCLOSURES I AM NOT A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR
DeborahRhodes_2010W@60.14:61.72 I'M NOT A RADIOLOGIST
DeborahRhodes_2010W@62.14:68.93 I DON'T HAVE ANY PATENTS AND I'VE NEVER RECEIVED ANY MONEY FROM A MEDICAL IMAGING COMPANY AND I AM NOT SEEKING YOUR VOTE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@72.04:82.35 WHAT I AM IS A DOCTOR OF INTERNAL MEDICINE WHO BECAME PASSIONATELY INTERESTED IN THIS TOPIC ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WHEN A PATIENT ASKED ME A QUESTION
DeborahRhodes_2010W@88.10:91.74 HER SISTER HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER IN HER FORTIES
DeborahRhodes_2010W@92.49:99.53 SHE AND I WERE BOTH VERY PREGNANT AT THAT TIME AND MY HEART JUST ACHED FOR HER IMAGINING HOW AFRAID SHE MUST BE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@103.48:104.85 BUT SHE ASKED ME A QUESTION
DeborahRhodes_2010W@105.59:110.78 HOW CONFIDENT WAS I THAT I WOULD FIND A TUMOR EARLY ON HER MAMMOGRAM IF SHE DEVELOPED ONE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@111.80:124.16 SO I STUDIED HER MAMMOGRAM AND I REVIEWED THE RADIOLOGY LITERATURE AND I WAS SHOCKED TO DISCOVER THAT IN HER CASE OUR CHANCES OF FINDING A TUMOR EARLY ON THE MAMMOGRAM WERE LESS THAN THE TOSS OF A COIN
DeborahRhodes_2010W@124.89:132.38 YOU MAY RECALL A YEAR AGO WHEN A FIRESTORM ERUPTED AFTER THE UNITED STATES PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@133.21:141.85 REVIEWED THE WORLD 'S MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING LITERATURE AND ISSUED A GUIDELINE RECOMMENDING AGAINST SCREENING MAMMOGRAMS IN WOMEN IN THEIR FORTIES
DeborahRhodes_2010W@142.68:157.31 NOW EVERYBODY RUSHED TO CRITICIZE THE TASK FORCE EVEN THOUGH MOST OF THEM WEREN'T IN ANYWAY FAMILIAR WITH THE MAMMOGRAPHY STUDIES IT TOOK THE SENATE JUST SEVENTEEN DAYS TO BAN THE USE OF THE GUIDELINES IN DETERMINING INSURANCE COVERAGE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@169.96:175.45 THE RADIOLOGISTS WERE IN TURN CRITICIZED FOR PROTECTING THEIR OWN FINANCIAL SELF INTEREST
DeborahRhodes_2010W@175.82:179.28 BUT IN MY VIEW THE RADIOLOGISTS ARE HEROES
DeborahRhodes_2010W@179.93:189.44 THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF RADIOLOGISTS QUALIFIED TO READ MAMMOGRAMS AND THAT'S BECAUSE MAMMOGRAMS ARE ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX OF ALL RADIOLOGY STUDIES TO INTERPRET
DeborahRhodes_2010W@190.00:196.57 AND BECAUSE RADIOLOGISTS ARE SUED MORE OFTEN OVER MISSED BREAST CANCER THAN ANY OTHER CAUSE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@198.30:199.86 VERY FACT IS TELLING
DeborahRhodes_2010W@207.90:211.28 MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT FIRE IS BREAST DENSITY
DeborahRhodes_2010W@216.14:225.38 PICTURED HERE IN YELLOW VERSUS CONNECTIVE AND EPITHELIAL TISSUES PICTURED IN PINK AND THAT PROPORTION IS PRIMARILY GENETICALLY DETERMINED
DeborahRhodes_2010W@225.93:231.40 TWO THIRDS OF WOMEN IN THEIR FORTIES HAVE DENSE BREAST TISSUE WHICH IS WHY MAMMOGRAPHY DOESN'T WORK AS WELL
DeborahRhodes_2010W@232.54:241.91 AND ALTHOUGH BREAST DENSITY GENERALLY DECLINES WITH AGE UP TO A THIRD OF WOMEN RETAIN DENSE BREAST TISSUE FOR YEARS AFTER MENOPAUSE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@243.38:245.57 SO HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOUR BREASTS ARE DENSE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@246.62:249.88 WELL YOU NEED TO READ THE DETAILS OF YOUR MAMMOGRAPHY REPORT
DeborahRhodes_2010W@258.17:270.22 IF THE BREAST IS LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT DENSE THAT'S CALLED FATTY REPLACED THE NEXT CATEGORY IS SCATTERED FIBROGLANDULAR DENSITIES FOLLOWED BY HETEROGENEOUSLY DENSE AND EXTREMELY DENSE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@270.75:278.80 AND BREAST THAT FALL INTO THESE TWO CATEGORIES ARE CONSIDERED DENSE THE PROBLEM WITH BREAST DENSITY IS THAT IT'S TRULY THE WOLF IN SHEEP 'S CLOTHING
DeborahRhodes_2010W@279.83:292.11 BOTH TUMORS AND DENSE BREAST TISSUE APPEAR WHITE ON A MAMMOGRAM AND THE X RAY OFTEN CAN'T DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO SO IT'S EASY TO SEE THIS TUMOR IN THE UPPER PART OF THIS FATTY BREAST
DeborahRhodes_2010W@292.58:296.40 BUT IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO FIND THAT TUMOR IN THIS DENSE BREAST
DeborahRhodes_2010W@298.17:305.18 WHY MAMMOGRAMS FIND OVER EIGHTY PERCENT OF TUMORS IN FATTY BREASTS BUT AS FEW AS FORTY PERCENT IN EXTREMELY DENSE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@306.24:320.13 NOW IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT BREAST DENSITY MAKES IT HARD TO FIND A CANCER BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S ALSO A POWERFUL PREDICTOR OF YOUR RISK FOR BREAST CANCER IT'S A STRONGER RISK FACTOR THAN HAVING A MOTHER OR A SISTER WITH BREAST CANCER
DeborahRhodes_2010W@320.61:332.61 AT THE TIME MY PATIENT POSED THIS QUESTION TO ME BREAST DENSITY WAS AN OBSCURE TOPIC IN THE RADIOLOGY LITERATURE AND VERY FEW WOMEN HAVING MAMMOGRAMS OR THE PHYSICIANS ORDERING THEM KNEW ABOUT
DeborahRhodes_2010W@333.53:335.21 BUT WHAT ELSE COULD I OFFER HER
DeborahRhodes_2010W@344.68:347.60 UNTIL DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY WAS APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND
DeborahRhodes_2010W@352.64:357.53 BUT THE IMAGES CAN BE STORED AND MANIPULATED DIGITALLY JUST LIKE WE CAN WITH A DIGITAL CAMERA
DeborahRhodes_2010W@358.63:365.07 THE U S HAS INVESTED FOUR BILLION DOLLARS CONVERTING TO DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT
DeborahRhodes_2010W@365.77:367.88 AND WHAT HAVE WE GAINED FROM THAT INVESTMENT
DeborahRhodes_2010W@368.58:381.09 IN A STUDY FUNDED BY OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION TAXPAYER DOLLARS DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY WAS FOUND TO BE NO BETTER OVER ALL THAN TRADITIONAL MAMMOGRAPHY AND IN FACT IT WAS WORSE IN OLDER WOMEN
DeborahRhodes_2010W@381.99:389.67 BUT IT WAS BETTER IN ONE GROUP AND THAT WAS WOMEN UNDER FIFTY WHO WERE PRE MENOPAUSAL AND HAD DENSE BREASTS
DeborahRhodes_2010W@390.19:397.10 AND IN THOSE WOMEN DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY FOUND TWICE AS MANY CANCERS BUT IT STILL ONLY FOUND SIXTY PERCENT
DeborahRhodes_2010W@398.18:409.33 SO DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY HAS BEEN A GIANT LEAP FORWARD FOR MANUFACTURERS OF DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT BUT IT'S BEEN A VERY SMALL STEP FORWARD FOR WOMANKIND
DeborahRhodes_2010W@410.63:418.88 WHAT ABOUT ULTRASOUND ULTRASOUND GENERATES MORE BIOPSIES THAT ARE UNNECESSARY RELATIVE TO OTHER TECHNOLOGIES SO IT'S NOT WIDELY USED
DeborahRhodes_2010W@419.48:425.16 AND MRI IS EXQUISITELY SENSITIVE FOR FINDING TUMORS BUT IT'S ALSO VERY EXPENSIVE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@426.67:437.68 IF WE THINK ABOUT DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY WE SEE AN ALMOST UBIQUITOUS PATTERN OF THE TECHNOLOGY GETTING SMALLER AND LESS EXPENSIVE THINK ABOUT IPODS COMPARED TO STEREOS
DeborahRhodes_2010W@438.30:440.88 BUT IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE IN HEALTH CARE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@441.50:445.05 THE MACHINES GET EVER BIGGER AND EVER MORE EXPENSIVE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@453.58:466.67 IT'S JUST WAY TOO MUCH EQUIPMENT ONE MRI SCAN COSTS TEN TIMES WHAT A DIGITAL MAMMOGRAM COSTS AND SOONER OR LATER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT HEALTH CARE INNOVATION CAN'T ALWAYS COME AT A MUCH HIGHER PRICE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@470.11:473.37 GLADWELL WROTE AN ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORKER ON INNOVATION
DeborahRhodes_2010W@473.76:480.16 AND HE MADE THE CASE THAT SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES ARE RARELY THE PRODUCT OF ONE INDIVIDUAL 'S GENIUS
DeborahRhodes_2010W@480.96:491.22 RATHER BIG IDEAS CAN BE ORCHESTRATED IF YOU CAN SIMPLY GATHER PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES IN A ROOM AND GET THEM TO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT THEY DON'T ORDINARILY TALK ABOUT
DeborahRhodes_2010W@491.75:493.42 IT'S LIKE THE ESSENCE OF TED
DeborahRhodes_2010W@494.44:502.89 HE QUOTES ONE INNOVATOR WHO SAYS THE ONLY TIME A PHYSICIAN AND A PHYSICIST GET TOGETHER IS WHEN THE PHYSICIST GETS
DeborahRhodes_2010W@504.85:516.30 THIS MAKES NO SENSE BECAUSE PHYSICIANS HAVE ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS THAT THEY DON'T REALIZE HAVE SOLUTIONS AND PHYSICISTS HAVE ALL KINDS OF SOLUTIONS FOR THINGS THAT THEY DON'T REALIZE ARE PROBLEMS
DeborahRhodes_2010W@518.08:525.66 TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CARTOON THAT ACCOMPANIED GLADWELL 'S ARTICLE AND TELL ME IF YOU SEE SOMETHING DISTURBING ABOUT THIS DEPICTION OF INNOVATIVE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@528.33:530.43 SO IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME A LITTLE CREATIVE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@532.80:540.11 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF THE SERENDIPITOUS COLLISION OF MY PATIENT 'S PROBLEM WITH A PHYSICIST 'S SOLUTION
DeborahRhodes_2010W@541.41:552.33 SHORTLY AFTER HER VISIT I WAS INTRODUCED TO A NUCLEAR PHYSICIST AT MAYO NAMED MICHAEL O 'CONNER WHO WAS A SPECIALIST IN CARDIAC IMAGING SOMETHING I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
DeborahRhodes_2010W@553.01:559.63 AND HE HAPPENED TO TELL ME ABOUT A CONFERENCE HE'D JUST RETURNED FROM IN ISRAEL WHERE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT A NEW TYPE OF GAMMA DETECTOR
DeborahRhodes_2010W@560.76:566.70 NOW GAMMA IMAGING HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME TO IMAGE THE HEART AND IT HAD EVEN BEEN TRIED TO IMAGE THE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@567.95:580.08 BUT THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THE GAMMA DETECTORS WERE THESE HUGE BULKY TUBES AND THEY WERE FILLED WITH THESE SCINTILLATING CRYSTALS AND YOU JUST COULDN'T GET THEM CLOSE ENOUGH AROUND THE BREAST TO FIND SMALL TUMORS
DeborahRhodes_2010W@588.55:594.87 THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD NOT FIND TUMORS WHEN THEY'RE SMALL AND FINDING A SMALL TUMOR IS CRITICAL FOR SURVIVAL
DeborahRhodes_2010W@595.42:604.11 IF YOU CAN FIND A TUMOR WHEN IT'S LESS THAN A CENTIMETER SURVIVAL EXCEEDS NINETY PERCENT BUT DROPS OFF RAPIDLY AS TUMOR SIZE INCREASES
DeborahRhodes_2010W@612.09:614.16 IT'S MADE NOT OF A
DeborahRhodes_2010W@615.52:619.80 BUT OF A THIN LAYER OF A SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIAL THAT SERVES AS THE GAMMA DETECTOR
DeborahRhodes_2010W@620.91:627.57 AND I STARTED TALKING TO HIM ABOUT THIS PROBLEM OF BREAST DENSITY AND WE REALIZED THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THIS DETECTOR
DeborahRhodes_2010W@640.29:644.33 MICHAEL HACKED OFF THE X RAY PLATE OF A MAMMOGRAPHY
DeborahRhodes_2010W@645.35:646.53 ABOUT TO BE THROWN OUT
DeborahRhodes_2010W@647.47:653.46 AND WE ATTACHED THE NEW DETECTOR AND WE DECIDED TO CALL THIS MACHINE MOLECULAR BREAST IMAGING OR
DeborahRhodes_2010W@655.95:665.56 THIS IS AN IMAGE FROM OUR FIRST PATIENT AND YOU CAN SEE USING THE OLD GAMMA TECHNOLOGY THAT IT JUST LOOKED LIKE NOISE BUT USING OUR NEW DETECTOR WE COULD BEGIN TO SEE THE OUTLINE OF A TUMOR
DeborahRhodes_2010W@666.63:673.72 SO HERE WE WERE A NUCLEAR PHYSICIST AN INTERNIST SOON JOINED BY CARRIE HRUSKA A BIOMEDICAL ENGINEER
DeborahRhodes_2010W@674.04:682.16 AND TWO RADIOLOGISTS AND WE WERE TRYING TO TAKE ON THE ENTRENCHED WORLD OF MAMMOGRAPHY WITH A MACHINE THAT WAS HELD TOGETHER BY DUCT TAPE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@684.23:698.84 TO SAY THAT WE FACED HIGH DOSES OF SKEPTICISM IN THOSE EARLY YEARS IS JUST A HUGE UNDERSTATEMENT BUT WE WERE SO CONVINCED THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS WORK THAT WE CHIPPED AWAY WITH INCREMENTAL MODIFICATIONS TO THIS SYSTEM
DeborahRhodes_2010W@700.01:703.83 THIS IS OUR CURRENT DETECTOR AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT LOOKS A LOT DIFFERENT
DeborahRhodes_2010W@704.23:713.40 THE DUCT TAPE IS GONE AND WE ADDED A SECOND DETECTOR ON TOP OF THE BREAST WHICH HAS FURTHER IMPROVED OUR TUMOR DETECTION SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
DeborahRhodes_2010W@714.32:725.06 THE PATIENT RECEIVES AN INJECTION OF A RADIO TRACER THAT'S TAKEN UP BY RAPIDLY PROLIFERATING TUMOR CELLS BUT NOT BY NORMAL CELLS AND THIS IS THE KEY DIFFERENCE FROM MAMMOGRAPHY
DeborahRhodes_2010W@736.89:743.65 EXPLOITS THE DIFFERENT MOLECULAR BEHAVIOR OF TUMORS AND THEREFORE IT'S IMPERVIOUS TO BREAST DENSITY
DeborahRhodes_2010W@744.85:748.44 AFTER THE INJECTION THE PATIENT 'S BREAST IS PLACED BETWEEN THE DETECTORS
DeborahRhodes_2010W@749.25:753.56 AND IF YOU'VE EVER HAD A MAMMOGRAM IF YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE HAD A MAMMOGRAM YOU KNOW WHAT COMES NEXT
DeborahRhodes_2010W@754.78:755.18 PAIN
DeborahRhodes_2010W@756.54:771.10 YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT MAMMOGRAPHY IS THE ONLY RADIOLOGIC STUDY THAT'S REGULATED BY FEDERAL LAW AND THE LAW REQUIRES THAT THE EQUIVALENT OF A FORTY LB CAR BATTERY COME DOWN ON YOUR BREAST DURING THIS STUDY
DeborahRhodes_2010W@772.76:776.74 BUT WITH MBI WE USE JUST LIGHT PAIN FREE COMPRESSION
DeborahRhodes_2010W@784.00:795.77 AND THE DETECTOR THEN TRANSMITS THE IMAGE TO THE COMPUTER SO HERE 'S AN EXAMPLE YOU CAN SEE ON THE RIGHT A MAMMOGRAM SHOWING A FAINT TUMOR THE EDGES OF WHICH ARE BLURRED BY THE DENSE TISSUE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@796.11:804.14 BUT THE MBI IMAGE SHOWS THAT TUMOR MUCH MORE CLEARLY AS WELL AS A SECOND TUMOR WHICH PROFOUNDLY INFLUENCE THAT PATIENT 'S SURGICAL OPTIONS
DeborahRhodes_2010W@805.06:812.77 IN THIS EXAMPLE ALTHOUGH THE MAMMOGRAM FOUND ONE TUMOR WE WERE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THREE DISCREET TUMORS ONE IS SMALL AS THREE MILLIMETERS
DeborahRhodes_2010W@818.79:831.51 AFTER WE HAD DEMONSTRATED THAT WE COULD FIND SMALL TUMORS WE USED THESE IMAGES TO SUBMIT A GRANT TO THE SUSAN G KOMEN FOUNDATION AND WE WERE ELATED WHEN THEY TOOK A CHANCE ON A TEAM OF COMPLETELY UNKNOWN INVESTIGATORS
DeborahRhodes_2010W@832.03:840.25 AND FUNDED US TO STUDY ONE THOUSAND WOMEN WITH DENSE BREASTS COMPARING A SCREENING MAMMOGRAM TO AN MBI OF THE TUMORS THAT WE FOUND
DeborahRhodes_2010W@849.30:860.66 HERE 'S AN EXAMPLE FROM THAT SCREENING STUDY THE DIGITAL MAMMOGRAM WAS READ AS NORMAL AND SHOWS LOTS OF DENSE TISSUE BUT THE MBI SHOWS AN AREA OF INTENSE UPTAKE WHICH CORRELATED WITH A TWO CENTIMETER TUMOR
DeborahRhodes_2010W@861.91:864.04 IN THIS CASE A ONE CENTIMETER TUMOR
DeborahRhodes_2010W@865.66:874.83 AND IN THIS CASE A FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD MEDICAL SECRETARY AT MAYO WHO HAD LOST HER MOTHER TO BREAST CANCER WHEN SHE WAS VERY YOUNG WANTED TO ENROLL IN OUR STUDY
DeborahRhodes_2010W@875.16:888.31 AND HER MAMMOGRAM SHOWED AN AREA OF VERY DENSE TISSUE BUT HER MBI SHOWED AN AREA OF WORRISOME UPTAKE WHICH WE CAN ALSO SEE ON A COLOR IMAGE AND THIS CORRESPONDED TO A TUMOR THE SIZE OF A GOLF BALL
DeborahRhodes_2010W@888.86:893.03 BUT FORTUNATELY IT WAS REMOVED BEFORE IT HAD SPREAD TO HER LYMPH NODES
DeborahRhodes_2010W@894.55:902.75 SO NOW THAT WE KNEW THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD FIND THREE TIMES MORE TUMORS IN A DENSE BREAST WE HAD TO SOLVE ONE VERY IMPORTANT PROBLEM
DeborahRhodes_2010W@903.08:912.68 WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LOWER THE RADIATION DOSE AND WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST THREE YEARS MAKING MODIFICATIONS TO EVERY ASPECT OF THE IMAGING SYSTEM TO ALLOW
DeborahRhodes_2010W@920.95:928.24 AND AT THIS LOW DOSE WE'RE CONTINUING THIS SCREENING STUDY AND THIS IMAGE FROM THREE WEEKS AGO IN A SIXTY SEVEN YEAR OLD WOMAN
DeborahRhodes_2010W@928.73:940.71 SHOWS A NORMAL DIGITAL MAMMOGRAM BUT AN MBI IMAGE SHOWING AN UPTAKE THAT PROVED TO BE A LARGE CANCER SO THIS IS NOT JUST YOUNG WOMEN THAT IT'S BENEFITING IT'S ALSO OLDER WOMEN WITH DENSE TISSUE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@941.65:954.32 AND WE'RE NOW ROUTINELY USING ONE FIFTH THE RADIATION DOSE THAT'S USED IN ANY OTHER TYPE OF GAMMA TECHNOLOGY MBI GENERATES FOUR IMAGES PER BREAST MRI GENERATES OVER A THOUSAND
DeborahRhodes_2010W@955.40:964.51 IT TAKES A RADIOLOGIST YEARS OF SPECIALTY TRAINING TO BECOME EXPERT IN DIFFERENTIATING THE NORMAL ANATOMIC DETAIL FROM THE WORRISOME FINDING
DeborahRhodes_2010W@965.42:970.27 BUT I SUSPECT EVEN THE NON RADIOLOGISTS IN THE ROOM CAN FIND THE TUMOR ON THE MBI IMAGE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@971.17:974.55 BUT THIS IS WHY MBI IS SO POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@981.97:987.69 BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THERE MAY BE FORCES IN THE BREAST IMAGING WORLD WHO PREFER THE STATUS QUO
DeborahRhodes_2010W@989.55:997.06 AFTER ACHIEVING WHAT WE FELT WERE REMARKABLE RESULTS OUR MANUSCRIPT WAS REJECTED BY FOUR JOURNALS
DeborahRhodes_2010W@998.44:1009.68 AFTER THE FOURTH REJECTION WE REQUESTED RECONSIDERATION OF THE MANUSCRIPT BECAUSE WE STRONGLY SUSPECTED ONE OF THE REVIEWERS WHO HAD REJECTED IT HAD A FINANCIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN A COMPETING TECHNOLOGY
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1010.48:1017.36 OUR MANUSCRIPT WAS THEN ACCEPTED AND WILL BE PUBLISHED LATER THIS MONTH IN THE JOURNAL RADIOLOGY
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1025.36:1034.99 WE STILL NEED TO COMPLETE THE SCREENING STUDY USING THE LOW DOSE AND THEN OUR FINDINGS WILL NEED TO BE REPLICATED AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS AND THIS COULD TAKE FIVE OR MORE YEARS
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1036.16:1047.05 IF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS WIDELY ADOPTED I WILL NOT BENEFIT FINANCIALLY IN ANY WAY AND THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ME TO CONTINUE TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1065.13:1070.29 THE MBI UNIT HAS NOW BEEN FDA APPROVED BUT IT'S NOT YET WIDELY AVAILABLE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1070.98:1074.54 SO UNTIL SOMETHING IS AVAILABLE FOR WOMEN WITH DENSE BREASTS
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1075.12:1077.90 THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1078.61:1086.74 FIRST KNOW YOUR DENSITY NINETY PERCENT OF WOMEN DON 'T AND NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF WOMEN DON'T KNOW THAT IT INCREASES YOUR BREAST CANCER RISK
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1087.80:1095.81 THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT BECAME THE FIRST AND ONLY STATE TO MANDATE THAT WOMEN RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF THEIR BREAST DENSITY AFTER A MAMMOGRAM
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1097.44:1109.78 I WAS AT A CONFERENCE OF SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN BREAST IMAGINING LAST WEEK IN CHICAGO AND I WAS STUNNED THAT THERE WAS A HEATED DEBATE AS TO WHETHER WE SHOULD BE TELLING WOMEN WHAT THEIR BREAST DENSITY IS
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1110.41:1116.92 OF COURSE WE SHOULD AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW PLEASE ASK YOUR DOCTOR OR READ THE DETAILS OF YOUR MAMMOGRAPHY REPORT
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1118.15:1125.61 SECOND IF YOU'RE PRE MENOPAUSAL TRY TO SCHEDULE YOUR MAMMOGRAM IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF YOUR MENSTRUAL CYCLE WHEN BREAST DENSITY IS RELATIVELY LOWER
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1126.99:1132.09 THIRD IF YOU NOTICE A PERSISTENT CHANGE IN YOUR BREAST INSIST ON ADDITIONAL IMAGINING
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1133.19:1135.00 AND FOURTH AND MOST IMPORTANT
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1135.42:1137.32 THE MAMMOGRAPHY DEBATE WILL RAGE ON
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1137.85:1142.13 BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT ALL WOMEN FORTY AND OLDER SHOULD HAVE AN ANNUAL MAMMOGRAM
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1149.83:1158.36 BUT THIS MORTALITY BANNER IS THE VERY SWORD WHICH MAMMOGRAPHY 'S MOST ARDENT ADVOCATES USE TO DETER INNOVATION
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1159.69:1173.02 SOME WOMEN WHO DEVELOP BREAST CANCER DIE FROM IT MANY YEARS LATER AND MOST WOMEN THANKFULLY SURVIVE SO IT TAKES TEN OR MORE YEARS FOR ANY SCREENING METHOD TO DEMONSTRATE A REDUCTION IN MORTALITY FROM BREAST CANCER
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1179.01:1180.76 IT IS TIME FOR US TO TO ACCEPT
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1181.63:1185.74 BOTH THE EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESSES OF MAMMOGRAPHY AND THE LIMITATIONS
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1186.16:1189.30 WE NEED TO INDIVIDUALIZE SCREENING BASED ON DENSITY
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1190.03:1194.41 FOR WOMEN WITHOUT DENSE BREASTS MAMMOGRAPHY IS THE BEST CHOICE
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1194.81:1201.01 BUT FOR WOMEN WITH DENSE BREASTS WE SHOULDN 'T ABANDON SCREENING ALTOGETHER WE NEED TO OFFER THEM SOMETHING BETTER
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1203.82:1211.38 THE BABIES THAT WE WERE CARRYING WHEN MY PATIENT FIRST ASKED ME THIS QUESTION ARE NOW BOTH IN MIDDLE SCHOOL
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1212.40:1215.23 AND THE ANSWER HAS BEEN SO SLOW TO COME
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1217.13:1220.21 SHE'S GIVEN ME HER BLESSING TO SHARE THIS STORY WITH YOU
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1221.99:1233.16 AFTER UNDERGOING BIOPSIES THAT FURTHER INCREASED HER RISK FOR CANCER AND LOSING HER SISTER TO CANCER SHE MADE THE DIFFICULT DECISION TO HAVE A PROPHYLACTIC MASTECTOMY
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1234.53:1237.06 WE CAN AND MUST DO BETTER
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1238.20:1240.92 NOT JUST IN TIME FOR HER GRANDDAUGHTERS AND MY
DeborahRhodes_2010W@1242.61:1243.47 IN TIME FOR YOU
