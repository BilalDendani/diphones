JaimeLerner_2007 MY ENGLISH IN THE MORNINGS IT IS TERRIBLE
JaimeLerner_2007 AND THE AFTERNOON IS
JaimeLerner_2007 DURING MANY YEARS
JaimeLerner_2007 I MADE SOME SPEECHES STARTING WITH THIS
JaimeLerner_2007 MORE AND MORE
JaimeLerner_2007 IT'S A SOLUTION
JaimeLerner_2007 FOR THE PROBLEM OF CLIMATE CHANGE BUT
JaimeLerner_2007 WE HAVE A VERY PESSIMISTIC APPROACH ABOUT THE CITIES I'M WORKING IN CITIES FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS
JaimeLerner_2007 WHERE EVERY MAYOR IS TRYING TO TELL ME OH HIS CITY IS SO BIG OR
JaimeLerner_2007 THE OTHER MAYORS SAY WE DON'T HAVE FINANCIAL RESOURCES
JaimeLerner_2007 WOULD LIKE TO SAY
JaimeLerner_2007 FROM THE EXPERIENCE I HAD EVERY CITY IN THE
JaimeLerner_2007 CAN BE IMPROVED
JaimeLerner_2007 IN LESS THAN THREE YEARS
JaimeLerner_2007 THERE'S NO MATTER OF SCALE IT'S NOT QUESTION OF SCALE IT'S NOT QUESTION OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES EVERY PROBLEM IN A CITY
JaimeLerner_2007 HAS TO HAVE ITS OWN EQUATION OF CO RESPONSIBILITY
JaimeLerner_2007 AND ALSO
JaimeLerner_2007 TO START I WANT TO INTRODUCE SOME CHARACTERS
JaimeLerner_2007 FROM A BOOK I MADE FOR TEENAGERS
JaimeLerner_2007 THE BEST EXAMPLE OF QUALITY OF LIFE
JaimeLerner_2007 WHEN YOU REALIZE
JaimeLerner_2007 THAT THE CASQUE OF THE TURTLE IT LOOKS LIKE AN URBAN
JaimeLerner_2007 THE CASQUE OFF THE
JaimeLerner_2007 HOW SAD SHE'S GOING TO BE
JaimeLerner_2007 AND THAT'S WE'RE DOING IN OUR CITIES
JaimeLerner_2007 LIVING HERE WORKING HERE HAVING LEISURE HERE
JaimeLerner_2007 HE IS INVITED FOR A PARTY HE NEVER WANTS TO LEAVE
JaimeLerner_2007 ARE ON THE TABLES AND STILL DRINKING AND HE DRINKS A LOT
JaimeLerner_2007 ONLY ONE OR TWO PEOPLE
JaimeLerner_2007 AND HE ASKS ALWAYS
JaimeLerner_2007 FOR MORE INFRASTRUCTURE
JaimeLerner_2007 FREEWAYS HE 'S VERY DEMANDING PERSON
JaimeLerner_2007 SO AND ON THE OTHER HAND
JaimeLerner_2007 FRIENDLY BUS HE CARRIES THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
JaimeLerner_2007 SWEDEN
JaimeLerner_2007 THREE HUNDRED BRAZILIANS
JaimeLerner_2007 SPEAKING ABOUT THE DESIGN EVERY CITY HAS ITS OWN DESIGN
JaimeLerner_2007 MY CITY
JaimeLerner_2007 THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE CITY ITSELF
JaimeLerner_2007 IT'S LIKE TWO BIRDS KISSING THEMSELVES
JaimeLerner_2007 VERY EASY MARKET STREET VAN NESS AND THE
JaimeLerner_2007 AND EVERY CITY HAS ITS OWN DESIGN
JaimeLerner_2007 BUT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO PROPOSE A SCENARIO AND TO PROPOSE
JaimeLerner_2007 A DESIGN AN IDEA THAT EVERYONE OR THE LARGE MAJORITY THEY'LL HELP YOU TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
JaimeLerner_2007 AN EXAMPLE OF LIVING AND WORKING TOGETHER
JaimeLerner_2007 AND THIS IS
JaimeLerner_2007 WHERE WE HAVE MORE DENSITY IT'S WHERE WE HAVE MORE PUBLIC TRANSPORT
JaimeLerner_2007 AND SO THIS
JaimeLerner_2007 AND IT TOOK
JaimeLerner_2007 TWENTY FIVE YEARS UNTIL ANOTHER CITY WHICH IS BOGOTA AND THEY DID A VERY GOOD JOB
JaimeLerner_2007 NOT FOR ONLY YOUR OWN CITY EVERY CITY
JaimeLerner_2007 BESIDES ITS NORMAL PROBLEMS THEY HAVE
JaimeLerner_2007 ROLE A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE
JaimeLerner_2007 BEING WITH THE WHOLE HUMANITY
JaimeLerner_2007 THAT MEANS MOSTLY TWO MAIN ISSUES MOBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY ARE BECOMING VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE CITIES AND THIS IS AN ARTICULATED BUS
JaimeLerner_2007 DOUBLE ARTICULATED
JaimeLerner_2007 AND WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO MY HOUSE YOU CAN COME WHEN YOU ARE IN CURITIBA AND HAVE A COFFEE
JaimeLerner_2007 WHAT IN THE DESIGN THAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE IS THE BOARDING TUBES THE BOARDING
JaimeLerner_2007 GIVES TO THE BUS THE SAME
JaimeLerner_2007 I'M TRYING TO SAY IT'S LIKE METRO NIZING THE BUS
JaimeLerner_2007 AND THIS IS THE DESIGN OF THE BUS
JaimeLerner_2007 AND YOU CAN PAY BEFORE ENTERING THE BUS YOU'RE BOARDING
JaimeLerner_2007 AND FOR HANDICAPPED THEY CAN USE THIS AS A NORMAL
JaimeLerner_2007 BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
JaimeLerner_2007 THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTION ON
JaimeLerner_2007 CARBON EMISSIONS ARE FROM THE CARS MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT
JaimeLerner_2007 WHEN WE DEPEND ONLY ON
JaimeLerner_2007 THAT'S WHY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
JaimeLerner_2007 AND ALSO HOW TO TEACH THE CHILDREN
JaimeLerner_2007 SPEAK ON THIS LATER ON
JaimeLerner_2007 OUR IDEA OF MOBILITY IS TRYING
JaimeLerner_2007 TO MAKE THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ALL THE SYSTEMS WE STARTED IN EIGHTY THREE PROPOSING FOR THE CITY OF RIO HOW TO CONNECT THE SUBWAY WITH THE BUS
JaimeLerner_2007 THE SUBWAY WAS AGAINST OF COURSE
JaimeLerner_2007 AND TWENTY
JaimeLerner_2007 THEY CALLED US TO DEVELOP WE'RE DEVELOPING THIS IDEA AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFERENT IT'S GOING TO BE THE IMAGE OF RIO WITH THE SYSTEM
JaimeLerner_2007 ONE MINUTE FREQUENCY
JaimeLerner_2007 AND IT'S NOT SHANGHAI IT'S NOT BEING COLORED DURING THE DAY ONLY AT NIGHT
JaimeLerner_2007 IT WILL LOOK THIS WAY
JaimeLerner_2007 BEFORE YOU SAY IT'S A NORMAN FOSTER DESIGN
JaimeLerner_2007 WE DESIGNED THIS IN
JaimeLerner_2007 WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
JaimeLerner_2007 I'M NOT TRYING TO PROVE
JaimeLerner_2007 SYSTEM OF TRANSPORT IS BETTER
JaimeLerner_2007 TO SAY WE HAVE TO COMBINE
JaimeLerner_2007 TO COMBINE ALL THE SYSTEMS
JaimeLerner_2007 NEVER
JaimeLerner_2007 IF YOU HAVE A
JaimeLerner_2007 ANY KIND OF SYSTEM
JaimeLerner_2007 NEVER COMPETE IN THE SAME
JaimeLerner_2007 AND COMING BACK TO THE CAR I ALWAYS USED TO SAY
JaimeLerner_2007 IS LIKE YOUR MOTHER IN LAW
JaimeLerner_2007 YOU HAVE TO HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH
JaimeLerner_2007 BUT SHE CANNOT COMMAND YOUR LIFE
JaimeLerner_2007 IS YOUR MOTHER IN LAW
JaimeLerner_2007 THE IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO TRANSFORM
JaimeLerner_2007 DESIGN OLD QUARRIES AND OPEN UNIVERSITIES AND BOTANIC GARDEN ALL OF IT'S RELATED TO HOW WE TEACH THE CHILDREN
JaimeLerner_2007 AND THE CHILDREN WE TEACH DURING SIX MONTHS HOW TO SEPERATE THEIR GARBAGE
JaimeLerner_2007 AND AFTER THE CHILDREN THEY
JaimeLerner_2007 TEACH THEIR PARENTS
JaimeLerner_2007 AND NOW WE HAVE SEVENTY PERCENT
JaimeLerner_2007 SINCE TWENTY YEARS IS THE HIGHEST RATE OF SEPARATION OF GARBAGE IN THE
JaimeLerner_2007 SO TEACH THE CHILDREN
JaimeLerner_2007 I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IF WE WANT TO HAVE A SUSTAINABLE
JaimeLerner_2007 WE HAVE TO WORK WITH
JaimeLerner_2007 BUT DON'T FORGET THE CITIES
JaimeLerner_2007 BECAUSE YOU CANNOT HAVE EMPTY PLACES DURING EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY
JaimeLerner_2007 TO UNDERSTAND THE SECTORS IN THE CITY THAT COULD PLAY DIFFERENT ROLES DURING THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS
JaimeLerner_2007 ANOTHER ISSUE IS A CITY 'S LIKE OUR FAMILY PORTRAIT WE DON'T
JaimeLerner_2007 OUR FAMILY PORTRAIT EVEN IF WE DON'T LIKE THE NOSE OF OUR
JaimeLerner_2007 BECAUSE THIS PORTRAIT
JaimeLerner_2007 AND THIS ARE THE REFERENCES
JaimeLerner_2007 WE HAVE
JaimeLerner_2007 CITY THIS IS THE MAIN PEDESTRIAN MALL WE DID IT
JaimeLerner_2007 IN SEVENTY TWO HOURS
JaimeLerner_2007 YES YOU HAVE TO BE
JaimeLerner_2007 AND THIS ARE THE
JaimeLerner_2007 REFERENCES FROM
JaimeLerner_2007 OUR ETHNIC CONTRIBUTION THIS IS THE ITALIAN PORTAL THE UKRAINIAN PARK
JaimeLerner_2007 THE POLISH
JaimeLerner_2007 WE HAVE PEOPLE FROM
JaimeLerner_2007 WE HAVE TO STOP THE PROGRAM
JaimeLerner_2007 FORGET CREATIVITY
JaimeLerner_2007 STARTS WHEN YOU CUT A ZERO
JaimeLerner_2007 FROM YOUR BUDGET IF YOU CUT TWO ZEROS IT'S MUCH BETTER
JaimeLerner_2007 AND THIS IS THE WIRE OPERA THEATER WE DID IT IN TWO MONTHS
JaimeLerner_2007 PARKS OLD QUARRIES THAT THEY WERE
JaimeLerner_2007 SOMETIMES WE TOOK THIS AND WE
JaimeLerner_2007 AND EVERY PART
JaimeLerner_2007 SO IN A CITY

JaimeLerner_2007 PLANNING TAKES TIME AND I'M PROPOSING URBAN ACUPUNCTURE THAT MEANS

JaimeLerner_2007 THIRTY TWO METERS
JaimeLerner_2007 I WANT JUST TO
JaimeLerner_2007 YOU CAN ALWAYS PROPOSE NEW MATERIALS
JaimeLerner_2007 NEW SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS BUT KEEP IN MIND
JaimeLerner_2007 WE HAVE TO WORK FAST

JaimeLerner_2007 AND WE CANNOT
JaimeLerner_2007 ALL THE
JaimeLerner_2007 SO WHEN YOU START AND WE CANNOT BE SO PREPOTENT ON HAVING ALL THE ANSWERS IT'S IMPORTANT STARTING AND
JaimeLerner_2007 HAVING THE CONTRIBUTION
