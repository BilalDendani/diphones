BeckyBlanton_2009G I'M A WRITER AND A JOURNALIST AND I'M ALSO AN INSANELY CURIOUS PERSON
BeckyBlanton_2009G SO IN TWENTY TWO YEARS AS A JOURNALIST I'VE LEARNED HOW TO DO A LOT OF NEW THINGS
BeckyBlanton_2009G AND THREE YEARS AGO
BeckyBlanton_2009G I BECAME ONE OF THE WORKING HOMELESS
BeckyBlanton_2009G I QUIT MY JOB AS A NEWSPAPER EDITOR
BeckyBlanton_2009G AFTER MY FATHER DIED IN FEBRUARY OF THAT SAME YEAR AND DECIDED TO TRAVEL
BeckyBlanton_2009G HIS DEATH HIT ME PRETTY HARD AND THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT I WANTED TO FEEL AND DEAL WITH WHILE I WAS DOING THAT I'VE CAMPED MY WHOLE LIFE AND I DECIDED THAT LIVING IN A VAN FOR A YEAR TO DO THIS WOULD BE LIKE ONE LONG CAMPING TRIP SO
BeckyBlanton_2009G THAT SOCIETY EQUATES LIVING IN A PERMANENT STRUCTURE EVEN A SHACK WITH HAVING VALUE AS A PERSON
BeckyBlanton_2009G TWO I FAILED TO REALIZE HOW QUICKLY THE NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE CAN IMPACT OUR REALITY IF WE LET IT
BeckyBlanton_2009G THREE I FAILED TO REALIZE THAT HOMELESSNESS IS AN ATTITUDE NOT A LIFESTYLE
BeckyBlanton_2009G I SHOWERED IN CAMPGROUNDS I ATE OUT REGULARLY AND I HAD TIME TO RELAX AND TO GRIEVE
BeckyBlanton_2009G BUT THEN THE ANGER AND THE DEPRESSION ABOUT MY FATHER 'S DEATH SET IN
BeckyBlanton_2009G MY FREELANCE JOB ENDED AND I HAD TO GET A FULL TIME JOB TO PAY THE BILLS
BeckyBlanton_2009G IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO PARK ANYWHERE
BeckyBlanton_2009G USED EMPLOYEE SHOWERS IN OFFICE BUILDINGS AND TRUCK STOPS OR I WASHED UP IN
BeckyBlanton_2009G FOOD ROTTED IN THE HEAT
BeckyBlanton_2009G ICE IN MY ICE CHEST MELTED WITHIN HOURS AND IT WAS PRETTY MISERABLE
BeckyBlanton_2009G I COULDN'T AFFORD TO FIND AN APARTMENT OR COULDN'T AFFORD AN APARTMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO HAVE THE ROTTWEILER AND THE CAT
BeckyBlanton_2009G AND I REFUSED TO GIVE THEM UP
BeckyBlanton_2009G SO I STAYED IN THE VAN
BeckyBlanton_2009G OUTSIDE MY VAN AT NIGHT I USED A BUCKET
BeckyBlanton_2009G A TRASH BAG AS A TOILET
BeckyBlanton_2009G A DIFFERENT PLACE EVERY NIGHT SO I WOULD AVOID BEING NOTICED AND HASSLED BY THE POLICE I DIDN'T ALWAYS SUCCEED BUT
BeckyBlanton_2009G OUT OF CONTROL OF MY LIFE
BeckyBlanton_2009G WHICH I WENT FROM BEING A TALENTED WRITER AND JOURNALIST
BeckyBlanton_2009G I HADN'T CHANGED
BeckyBlanton_2009G MY I Q HADN'T DROPPED MY TALENT
BeckyBlanton_2009G MY INTEGRITY MY VALUES
BeckyBlanton_2009G AND AS DEPRESSED AS ANYONE IN LINE
BeckyBlanton_2009G I JUST WASN'T DRUNK OR HIGH
BeckyBlanton_2009G YOU AREN'T HOMELESS WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
BeckyBlanton_2009G OTHER HOMELESS PEOPLE DIDN'T SEE ME AS HOMELESS BUT I DID
BeckyBlanton_2009G A REACTION TO THE MEDICATION THE CLINIC GAVE ME FOR MY DEPRESSION LEFT ME SUICIDAL AND I REMEMBER THINKING
BeckyBlanton_2009G IF I KILLED MYSELF NO ONE WOULD NOTICE
BeckyBlanton_2009G A FRIEND TOLD ME SHORTLY AFTER THAT THAT SHE HAD HEARD THAT TIM RUSSERT A NATIONALLY RENOWNED JOURNALIST HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT ME ON NATIONAL
BeckyBlanton_2009G AN ESSAY I'D WRITTEN ABOUT MY FATHER THE YEAR BEFORE HE DIED
BeckyBlanton_2009G WAS IN TIM 'S NEW BOOK AND HE WAS DOING THE TALK SHOW CIRCUIT AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT MY WRITING AND WHEN I REALIZED THAT TIM RUSSERT
BeckyBlanton_2009G FORMER MODERATOR OF MEET THE PRESS WAS TALKING ABOUT MY WRITING
BeckyBlanton_2009G WHILE I WAS LIVING IN A VAN IN A WAL MART PARKING LOT I STARTED LAUGHING YOU SHOULD TOO I STARTED LAUGHING
BeckyBlanton_2009G BY THE SUMMER OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR I WAS A WORKING JOURNALIST I WAS WINNING AWARDS I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS AND I WAS NO LONGER INVISIBLE
BeckyBlanton_2009G THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WORK FULL AND PART TIME JOBS AND LIVE IN THEIR CARS
BeckyBlanton_2009G SO THE HOMELESS THE WORKING HOMELESS PRIMARILY REMAIN INVISIBLE BUT IF YOU EVER MEET ONE
BeckyBlanton_2009G ENGAGE THEM ENCOURAGE THEM AND OFFER THEM HOPE
BeckyBlanton_2009G THE HUMAN SPIRIT CAN OVERCOME ANYTHING IF IT HAS HOPE
BeckyBlanton_2009G OR WHAT THEIR LIFE SITUATION IS AT ANY GIVEN TIME
BeckyBlanton_2009G THREE YEARS AGO I WAS LIVING IN A VAN IN A WAL MART PARKING LOT
BeckyBlanton_2009G AND TODAY I'M SPEAKING AT TED
BeckyBlanton_2009G HOPE ALWAYS ALWAYS FINDS A WAY
