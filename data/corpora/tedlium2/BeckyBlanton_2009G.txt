BeckyBlanton_2009G@16.42:21.17 I'M A WRITER AND A JOURNALIST AND I'M ALSO AN INSANELY CURIOUS PERSON
BeckyBlanton_2009G@21.58:25.53 SO IN TWENTY TWO YEARS AS A JOURNALIST I'VE LEARNED HOW TO DO A LOT OF NEW THINGS
BeckyBlanton_2009G@25.98:27.25 AND THREE YEARS AGO
BeckyBlanton_2009G@31.18:32.93 I BECAME ONE OF THE WORKING HOMELESS
BeckyBlanton_2009G@34.30:36.44 I QUIT MY JOB AS A NEWSPAPER EDITOR
BeckyBlanton_2009G@37.29:41.71 AFTER MY FATHER DIED IN FEBRUARY OF THAT SAME YEAR AND DECIDED TO TRAVEL
BeckyBlanton_2009G@43.70:55.76 HIS DEATH HIT ME PRETTY HARD AND THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT I WANTED TO FEEL AND DEAL WITH WHILE I WAS DOING THAT I'VE CAMPED MY WHOLE LIFE AND I DECIDED THAT LIVING IN A VAN FOR A YEAR TO DO THIS WOULD BE LIKE ONE LONG CAMPING TRIP SO
BeckyBlanton_2009G@69.36:75.94 THAT SOCIETY EQUATES LIVING IN A PERMANENT STRUCTURE EVEN A SHACK WITH HAVING VALUE AS A PERSON
BeckyBlanton_2009G@76.64:83.95 TWO I FAILED TO REALIZE HOW QUICKLY THE NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE CAN IMPACT OUR REALITY IF WE LET IT
BeckyBlanton_2009G@84.77:89.95 THREE I FAILED TO REALIZE THAT HOMELESSNESS IS AN ATTITUDE NOT A LIFESTYLE
BeckyBlanton_2009G@93.87:99.25 I SHOWERED IN CAMPGROUNDS I ATE OUT REGULARLY AND I HAD TIME TO RELAX AND TO GRIEVE
BeckyBlanton_2009G@100.25:103.36 BUT THEN THE ANGER AND THE DEPRESSION ABOUT MY FATHER 'S DEATH SET IN
BeckyBlanton_2009G@104.64:108.66 MY FREELANCE JOB ENDED AND I HAD TO GET A FULL TIME JOB TO PAY THE BILLS
BeckyBlanton_2009G@113.51:115.49 IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO PARK ANYWHERE
BeckyBlanton_2009G@130.17:135.54 USED EMPLOYEE SHOWERS IN OFFICE BUILDINGS AND TRUCK STOPS OR I WASHED UP IN
BeckyBlanton_2009G@145.06:146.63 FOOD ROTTED IN THE HEAT
BeckyBlanton_2009G@147.35:152.88 ICE IN MY ICE CHEST MELTED WITHIN HOURS AND IT WAS PRETTY MISERABLE
BeckyBlanton_2009G@158.21:164.49 I COULDN'T AFFORD TO FIND AN APARTMENT OR COULDN'T AFFORD AN APARTMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO HAVE THE ROTTWEILER AND THE CAT
BeckyBlanton_2009G@164.87:166.24 AND I REFUSED TO GIVE THEM UP
BeckyBlanton_2009G@166.79:168.00 SO I STAYED IN THE VAN
BeckyBlanton_2009G@177.91:180.17 OUTSIDE MY VAN AT NIGHT I USED A BUCKET
BeckyBlanton_2009G@180.57:182.08 A TRASH BAG AS A TOILET
BeckyBlanton_2009G@194.24:200.96 A DIFFERENT PLACE EVERY NIGHT SO I WOULD AVOID BEING NOTICED AND HASSLED BY THE POLICE I DIDN'T ALWAYS SUCCEED BUT
BeckyBlanton_2009G@205.68:207.01 OUT OF CONTROL OF MY LIFE
BeckyBlanton_2009G@212.73:216.25 WHICH I WENT FROM BEING A TALENTED WRITER AND JOURNALIST
BeckyBlanton_2009G@221.51:222.69 I HADN'T CHANGED
BeckyBlanton_2009G@223.13:225.52 MY I Q HADN'T DROPPED MY TALENT
BeckyBlanton_2009G@228.24:229.65 MY INTEGRITY MY VALUES
BeckyBlanton_2009G@245.87:247.61 AND AS DEPRESSED AS ANYONE IN LINE
BeckyBlanton_2009G@248.58:249.77 I JUST WASN'T DRUNK OR HIGH
BeckyBlanton_2009G@257.80:260.01 YOU AREN'T HOMELESS WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
BeckyBlanton_2009G@260.46:263.43 OTHER HOMELESS PEOPLE DIDN'T SEE ME AS HOMELESS BUT I DID
BeckyBlanton_2009G@276.98:281.70 A REACTION TO THE MEDICATION THE CLINIC GAVE ME FOR MY DEPRESSION LEFT ME SUICIDAL AND I REMEMBER THINKING
BeckyBlanton_2009G@282.29:284.74 IF I KILLED MYSELF NO ONE WOULD NOTICE
BeckyBlanton_2009G@295.51:302.86 A FRIEND TOLD ME SHORTLY AFTER THAT THAT SHE HAD HEARD THAT TIM RUSSERT A NATIONALLY RENOWNED JOURNALIST HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT ME ON NATIONAL
BeckyBlanton_2009G@303.92:306.95 AN ESSAY I'D WRITTEN ABOUT MY FATHER THE YEAR BEFORE HE DIED
BeckyBlanton_2009G@308.26:314.75 WAS IN TIM 'S NEW BOOK AND HE WAS DOING THE TALK SHOW CIRCUIT AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT MY WRITING AND WHEN I REALIZED THAT TIM RUSSERT
BeckyBlanton_2009G@315.23:318.10 FORMER MODERATOR OF MEET THE PRESS WAS TALKING ABOUT MY WRITING
BeckyBlanton_2009G@318.46:326.55 WHILE I WAS LIVING IN A VAN IN A WAL MART PARKING LOT I STARTED LAUGHING YOU SHOULD TOO I STARTED LAUGHING
BeckyBlanton_2009G@354.23:363.78 BY THE SUMMER OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR I WAS A WORKING JOURNALIST I WAS WINNING AWARDS I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS AND I WAS NO LONGER INVISIBLE
BeckyBlanton_2009G@365.80:369.71 THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WORK FULL AND PART TIME JOBS AND LIVE IN THEIR CARS
BeckyBlanton_2009G@377.09:381.82 SO THE HOMELESS THE WORKING HOMELESS PRIMARILY REMAIN INVISIBLE BUT IF YOU EVER MEET ONE
BeckyBlanton_2009G@382.55:385.43 ENGAGE THEM ENCOURAGE THEM AND OFFER THEM HOPE
BeckyBlanton_2009G@386.79:389.94 THE HUMAN SPIRIT CAN OVERCOME ANYTHING IF IT HAS HOPE
BeckyBlanton_2009G@404.70:407.52 OR WHAT THEIR LIFE SITUATION IS AT ANY GIVEN TIME
BeckyBlanton_2009G@409.40:413.90 THREE YEARS AGO I WAS LIVING IN A VAN IN A WAL MART PARKING LOT
BeckyBlanton_2009G@414.75:417.68 AND TODAY I'M SPEAKING AT TED
BeckyBlanton_2009G@418.14:421.73 HOPE ALWAYS ALWAYS FINDS A WAY
