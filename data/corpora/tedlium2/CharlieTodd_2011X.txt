CharlieTodd_2011X SO SHE 'S NOTICED THE UNUSUAL THING BUT SHE 'S GONE BACK TO HER NORMAL LIFE NOW IN THE MEANTIME I HAVE SIX FRIENDS WHO ARE WAITING AT THE NEXT SIX CONSECUTIVE STOPS IN THEIR UNDERWEAR AS WELL THEY 'RE GOING TO BE ENTERING THIS CAR ONE BY ONE WE 'LL ACT AS THOUGH WE DON 'T KNOW EACH OTHER
CharlieTodd_2011X SO
CharlieTodd_2011X WITHOUT REVEALING WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND WENT IN ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
CharlieTodd_2011X FROM THE VIDEO THERE AND I LOVE THAT GIRL 'S REACTION SO MUCH AND WATCHING THAT VIDEOTAPE LATER THAT
CharlieTodd_2011X DAY INSPIRED ME TO KEEP DOING WHAT I DO AND REALLY ONE OF THE POINTS OF IMPROV EVERYWHERE IS TO CAUSE A SCENE IN A PUBLIC PLACE THAT IS A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE FOR OTHER PEOPLE IT 'S A PRANK BUT IT 'S A PRANK THAT GIVES SOMEBODY A GREAT STORY TO TELL
CharlieTodd_2011X AS I STARTED TAKING IMPROV CLASS AT THE UPRIGHT CITIZENS BRIGADE THEATER AND MEETING OTHER CREATIVE PEOPLE AND OTHER PERFORMERS AND COMEDIANS I STARTED AMASSING A MAILING LIST OF PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO DO THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS SO I COULD DO MORE LARGE SCALE PROJECTS WELL ONE DAY I WAS WALKING THROUGH UNION SQUARE AND I SAW THIS BUILDING WHICH HAD JUST BEEN BUILT IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE
CharlieTodd_2011X AND THERE WAS A GIRL IN ONE OF THE WINDOWS AND SHE WAS DANCING AND IT WAS VERY PECULIAR BECAUSE IT WAS DARK OUT BUT SHE WAS BACK LIT WITH FLORESCENT LIGHTING AND SHE WAS VERY MUCH ONSTAGE AND I COULDN 'T FIGURE OUT WHY SHE WAS DOING IT AFTER ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS HER FRIEND APPEARED SHE HAD BEEN HIDING BEHIND A DISPLAY AND THEY LAUGHED AND HUGGED EACH OTHER AND RAN AWAY SO IT SEEMED LIKE MAYBE SHE HAD BEEN DARED TO DO THIS
CharlieTodd_2011X SO I GOT INSPIRED BY THAT LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE FACADE THERE WERE SEVENTY TOTAL WINDOWS AND I KNEW WHAT I HAD TO DO
CharlieTodd_2011X THE NAME OF THE PROJECT THE SECOND SIGNAL WAS FOR EVERYBODY TO DO JUMPING JACKS TOGETHER
CharlieTodd_2011X YOU 'LL SEE THAT START RIGHT HERE
CharlieTodd_2011X SO THEN I GAVE A NEW HAND SIGNAL WHICH SIGNALED THE NEXT SOLOIST DOWN BELOW IN FOREVER TWENTY ONE AND HE DANCED THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER ACTIVITIES WE HAD PEOPLE JUMPING UP AND DOWN PEOPLE DROPPING TO THE GROUND AND I WAS STANDING JUST ANONYMOUSLY IN A SWEATSHIRT PUTTING MY HAND ON AND OFF OF A TRASHCAN
CharlieTodd_2011X TO SIGNAL THE ADVANCEMENT AND BECAUSE IT WAS IN UNION SQUARE PARK RIGHT BY A SUBWAY STATION THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE BY THE END WHO STOPPED AND LOOKED UP AND WATCHED WHAT WE WERE DOING
CharlieTodd_2011X THERE 'S A BETTER PHOTO OF IT SO THAT PARTICULAR EVENT WAS INSPIRED BY A MOMENT THAT I HAPPENED TO STUMBLE UPON
CharlieTodd_2011X THE NEXT PROJECT I WANT TO SHOW WAS GIVEN TO ME IN AN EMAIL FROM A STRANGER A HIGH SCHOOL KID IN TEXAS WROTE ME IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND SAID YOU SHOULD GET AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE TO PUT ON BLUE POLO SHIRTS AND KHAKI PANTS AND GO INTO A BEST BUY AND STAND AROUND
CharlieTodd_2011X THEY STARTED RUNNING AROUND TELLING EVERYBODY THE COPS WERE COMING WATCH OUT THE COPS WERE COMING AND YOU CAN SEE THE COPS IN THIS FOOTAGE RIGHT HERE THAT 'S A COP WEARING BLACK RIGHT THERE BEING FILMED WITH A HIDDEN CAMERA ULTIMATELY THE POLICE HAD TO INFORM BEST BUY MANAGEMENT THAT IT WAS NOT IN FACT ILLEGAL TO WEAR A BLUE POLO SHIRT
CharlieTodd_2011X FOR TWENTY MINUTES WE WERE HAPPY TO EXIT THE STORE ONE THING THE MANAGERS WERE TRYING TO DO WAS TO TRACK DOWN OUR CAMERAS AND THEY CAUGHT A COUPLE OF MY GUYS WHO HAD HIDDEN CAMERAS IN DUFFEL BAGS BUT THE ONE CAMERA GUY THEY NEVER CAUGHT WAS THE GUY THAT WENT IN JUST WITH A BLANK TAPE AND WENT OVER TO THE BEST BUY CAMERA DEPARTMENT AND JUST PUT HIS TAPE IN ONE OF THEIR
CharlieTodd_2011X LIKE THAT CONCEPT OF USING THEIR OWN TECHNOLOGY AGAINST THEM
CharlieTodd_2011X A LITTLE BIT BETTER HE GAVE TWO THOUSAND HIGH FIVES THAT DAY
CharlieTodd_2011X BUT THAT ONE 'S ALWAYS BOTHERED ME BECAUSE WE DON 'T HAVE TOO MUCH TIME ON OUR HANDS THE PARTICIPANTS AT IMPROV EVERYWHERE EVENTS HAVE JUST AS MUCH LEISURE TIME AS ANY OTHER NEW YORKERS THEY JUST OCCASIONALLY CHOOSE TO SPEND IT IN AN UNUSUAL WAY YOU KNOW EVERY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EACH FALL GATHER IN FOOTBALL STADIUMS TO WATCH GAMES
CharlieTodd_2011X OR LISTENING TO THE SAME MP THREE AS THREE THOUSAND OTHER PEOPLE AND DANCING SILENTLY IN A PARK OR BURSTING INTO SONG IN A GROCERY STORE AS PART OF A SPONTANEOUS MUSICAL OR DIVING INTO THE OCEAN IN CONEY ISLAND WEARING FORMAL ATTIRE
CharlieTodd_2011X YOU KNOW AS KIDS WE 'RE TAUGHT TO PLAY AND WE 'RE NEVER GIVEN A REASON WHY WE SHOULD PLAY IT 'S JUST ACCEPTABLE THAT PLAY IS A GOOD THING
CharlieTodd_2011X AND I THINK THAT 'S SORT OF THE POINT OF IMPROV EVERYWHERE IT 'S THAT THERE IS NO POINT AND THAT THERE DOESN 'T HAVE TO BE A POINT WE DON 'T NEED A REASON
CharlieTodd_2011X AS LONG AS IT 'S FUN AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT 'S GOING TO BE A FUNNY IDEA AND IT SEEMS LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO WITNESS IT WILL ALSO HAVE A FUN TIME THEN THAT 'S ENOUGH FOR US AND I THINK AS ADULTS WE NEED TO LEARN THAT THERE 'S NO RIGHT OR WRONG WAY TO PLAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
