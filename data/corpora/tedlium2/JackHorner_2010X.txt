JackHorner_2010X I ASK FOR A SHOW OF HANDS OR A CLAPPING
JackHorner_2010X I 'M INTERESTED IN HOW MANY ARE THREE TO TWELVE YEARS OLD
JackHorner_2010X DINOSAURS ARE KIND OF FUNNY YOU KNOW
JackHorner_2010X THAT 'S SORT OF THE THEME BIG DIFFERENT AND GONE
JackHorner_2010X THE TITLE OF MY TALK
JackHorner_2010X SHAPE SHIFTING DINOSAURS THE CAUSE OF A PREMATURE EXTINCTION NOW I ASSUME THAT WE REMEMBER DINOSAURS AND THERE 'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT SHAPES LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS A LONG TIME AGO
JackHorner_2010X BACK IN THE EARLY ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED S MUSEUMS WERE OUT LOOKING FOR DINOSAURS THEY WENT OUT AND GATHERED THEM UP
JackHorner_2010X EVERY MUSEUM WANTED A LITTLE BIGGER OR BETTER ONE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
JackHorner_2010X SO IF THE MUSEUM IN TORONTO WENT OUT AND COLLECTED
JackHorner_2010X AND A BETTER ONE AND THAT HAPPENED FOR ALL MUSEUMS SO EVERYONE WAS OUT LOOKING FOR ALL THESE BIGGER AND BETTER DINOSAURS
JackHorner_2010X WHERE ARE ALL THE LITTLE ONES
JackHorner_2010X AND THEY THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND THEY EVEN WROTE PAPERS ABOUT IT
JackHorner_2010X WHERE ARE THE LITTLE DINOSAURS
JackHorner_2010X GO TO A MUSEUM YOU 'LL SEE
JackHorner_2010X SEE HOW MANY BABY DINOSAURS THERE ARE
JackHorner_2010X PEOPLE ASSUMED AND THIS WAS ACTUALLY A PROBLEM PEOPLE ASSUMED THAT
JackHorner_2010X IF THEY HAD LITTLE DINOSAURS IF THEY HAD JUVENILE DINOSAURS THEY 'D BE EASY TO IDENTIFY
JackHorner_2010X BUT ALL THEY HAD WERE BIG DINOSAURS
JackHorner_2010X AND IT COMES DOWN TO A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST OFF
JackHorner_2010X SCIENTISTS HAVE EGOS
JackHorner_2010X AND SCIENTISTS LIKE TO NAME DINOSAURS
JackHorner_2010X AND WHAT HAPPENED OF COURSE IS WE ENDED UP WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT DINOSAURS
JackHorner_2010X IN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
JackHorner_2010X A LIGHT WENT ON IN SOMEBODY 'S HEAD DR PETER DODSON AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA ACTUALLY REALIZED THAT DINOSAURS
JackHorner_2010X GREW KIND OF LIKE BIRDS DO
JackHorner_2010X WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY REPTILES GROW
JackHorner_2010X THE CASSOWARY AS AN EXAMPLE
JackHorner_2010X AND IT 'S KIND OF COOL IF YOU LOOK AT THE CASSOWARY OR ANY OF THE BIRDS THAT HAVE CRESTS ON THEIR HEADS THEY ACTUALLY GROW TO ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT ADULT SIZE BEFORE THE CREST STARTS TO GROW
JackHorner_2010X IN WHAT WE CALL ONTOGENY SO ALLOMETRIC CRANIAL ONTOGENY
JackHorner_2010X ONE THAT WAS EIGHTY PERCENT GROWN
JackHorner_2010X AND YOU DIDN 'T KNOW THAT IT WAS GOING TO GROW UP TO A CASSOWARY YOU WOULD THINK THEY WERE TWO DIFFERENT ANIMALS
JackHorner_2010X SO THIS WAS A PROBLEM AND
JackHorner_2010X PETER DODSON POINTED THIS OUT USING SOME DUCK BILLED DINOSAURS
JackHorner_2010X A BABY AND AN ADULT AND MAKE AN AVERAGE OF WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE IF IT GREW IN SORT OF A LINEAR FASHION
JackHorner_2010X IT WOULD HAVE A CREST ABOUT HALF THE SIZE OF THE ADULT
JackHorner_2010X TAKEN THAT TAKEN PETER DODSON 'S WORK AND
JackHorner_2010X GONE ON WITH THAT THEN WE WOULD HAVE A LOT LESS DINOSAURS THAN WE HAVE
JackHorner_2010X BUT SCIENTISTS HAVE EGOS THEY LIKE TO NAME THINGS
JackHorner_2010X NOW WE HAVE A WAY OF ACTUALLY TESTING TO SEE WHETHER A DINOSAUR OR ANY ANIMAL IS A YOUNG ONE OR AN OLDER ONE AND THAT 'S BY ACTUALLY CUTTING INTO THEIR BONES
JackHorner_2010X BUT CUTTING INTO THE BONES OF A DINOSAUR IS HARD TO DO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE BECAUSE
JackHorner_2010X THEY 'RE VERY WELL TAKEN CARE OF
JackHorner_2010X THEY DON 'T LIKE IT IF YOU COME IN AND WANT TO SAW THEM OPEN AND LOOK INSIDE
JackHorner_2010X I HAVE A MUSEUM AND I COLLECT DINOSAURS
JackHorner_2010X AND I CAN SAW MINE OPEN SO THAT 'S WHAT I DO
JackHorner_2010X IF YOU CUT OPEN A LITTLE DINOSAUR
JackHorner_2010X IT 'S VERY SPONGY INSIDE LIKE A AND IF YOU CUT INTO AN OLDER DINOSAUR IT 'S VERY MASSIVE YOU CAN TELL IT 'S MATURE BONE SO IT 'S REAL EASY TO TELL THEM APART
JackHorner_2010X THERE 'S THIS UNIT OF ROCK CALLED THE HELL CREEK FORMATION THAT PRODUCES THE LAST DINOSAURS THAT LIVED ON EARTH AND THERE ARE TWELVE OF THEM THAT EVERYONE RECOGNIZES I MEAN THE TWELVE PRIMARY DINOSAURS THAT WENT EXTINCT
JackHorner_2010X AND SO WE WILL EVALUATE
JackHorner_2010X AND THAT 'S SORT OF WHAT I 'VE BEEN DOING SO MY STUDENTS MY STAFF WE 'VE BEEN
JackHorner_2010X CUTTING THEM OPEN
JackHorner_2010X DINOSAUR 'S SKULL DO YOU
JackHorner_2010X AND THE ASSUMPTION IS IS THAT THEY 'RE RELATED LIKE COUSINS OR WHATEVER BUT NO ONE EVER CONSIDERED THAT THEY MIGHT BE MORE CLOSELY RELATED
JackHorner_2010X IN OTHER WORDS PEOPLE LOOKED AT THEM AND THEY SAW THE DIFFERENCES
JackHorner_2010X AND YOU ALL KNOW THAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU 'RE RELATED TO YOUR BROTHER OR YOUR SISTER YOU CAN 'T DO IT BY LOOKING AT DIFFERENCES YOU CAN ONLY DETERMINE RELATEDNESS BY LOOKING FOR SIMILARITIES SO
JackHorner_2010X PEOPLE WERE LOOKING AT THESE AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT THEY ARE
JackHorner_2010X AND THEN STYGIMOLOCH ANOTHER DINOSAUR FROM THE SAME AGE LIVED AT THE SAME TIME
JackHorner_2010X HAS SPIKES STICKING OUT THE BACK OF ITS HEAD IT 'S GOT A LITTLE TINY DOME
JackHorner_2010X AND IT 'S GOT A BUNCH OF GNARLY STUFF ON ITS NOSE
JackHorner_2010X HERE 'S A DINOSAUR THAT HAS SPIKES STICKING OUT OF ITS HEAD NO DOME AND GNARLY STUFF ON ITS NOSE
JackHorner_2010X NOBODY NOTICED THE GNARLY STUFF SORT OF LOOKED ALIKE BUT THEY DID LOOK AT THESE THREE AND THEY SAID
JackHorner_2010X THESE ARE THREE DIFFERENT DINOSAURS AND DRACOREX IS PROBABLY THE MOST PRIMITIVE OF THEM AND THE OTHER ONE IS
JackHorner_2010X MORE PRIMITIVE THAN THE OTHER IT 'S UNCLEAR TO ME HOW THEY ACTUALLY SORTED THESE THREE OF THEM OUT BUT IF YOU LINE THEM UP IF YOU JUST TAKE THOSE THREE SKULLS AND JUST LINE THEM UP
JackHorner_2010X THEY LINE UP LIKE THIS DRACOREX IS THE LITTLEST ONE
JackHorner_2010X THAT SHOULD GIVE ME A CLUE
JackHorner_2010X AND LOOK IT WAS SPONGY INSIDE
JackHorner_2010X REALLY SPONGY INSIDE I MEAN IT IS A JUVENILE AND IT 'S GROWING REALLY FAST
JackHorner_2010X SO IT IS GOING TO GET BIGGER IF YOU CUT OPEN STYGIMOLOCH IT IS DOING THE SAME THING THE DOME THAT LITTLE DOME IS GROWING REALLY FAST IT 'S INFLATING VERY FAST
JackHorner_2010X WHAT 'S INTERESTING IS THE SPIKE ON THE BACK OF THE DRACOREX WAS GROWING VERY FAST AS WELL THE SPIKES ON THE BACK OF THE STYGIMOLOCH ARE ACTUALLY RESORBING WHICH MEANS THEY 'RE GETTING SMALLER
JackHorner_2010X AND ITS LITTLE BUMPS ON THE BACK OF ITS HEAD WERE ALSO RESORBING SO
JackHorner_2010X JUST WITH THESE THREE DINOSAURS YOU CAN EASILY AS A SCIENTIST WE CAN EASILY HYPOTHESIZE THAT IT IS JUST A GROWTH SERIES
JackHorner_2010X OF THE SAME ANIMAL
JackHorner_2010X SO A COLLEAGUE OF MINE AT BERKLEY HE AND I WERE LOOKING AT TRICERATOPS AND
JackHorner_2010X BEFORE THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND NOW REMEMBER TRICERATOPS WAS FIRST FOUND IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED S BEFORE TWO THOUSAND NO ONE HAD EVER SEEN A JUVENILE TRICERATOPS
JackHorner_2010X THERE 'S A TRICERATOPS IN EVERY MUSEUM IN THE WORLD
JackHorner_2010X BUT NO ONE HAD EVER COLLECTED A JUVENILE
JackHorner_2010X THEY 'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE
JackHorner_2010X SO WE HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM AT OUR MUSEUM
JackHorner_2010X AND THEN AS THEY GROW OLDER THE HORNS GROW FORWARD
JackHorner_2010X AND THAT 'S PRETTY COOL IF YOU LOOK ALONG THE EDGE OF THE FRILL THEY HAVE THESE LITTLE TRIANGULAR BONES THAT ACTUALLY GROW BIG AS TRIANGLES AND THEN THEY FLATTEN AGAINST THE FRILL PRETTY MUCH LIKE THE
JackHorner_2010X AND THEN BECAUSE THE JUVENILES ARE IN MY COLLECTION I CUT THEM OPEN
JackHorner_2010X THE ADULT TRICERATOPS WAS ALSO SPONGY AND THIS IS A SKULL THAT IS TWO METERS LONG
JackHorner_2010X BUT THERE 'S ANOTHER DINOSAUR THAT IS FOUND IN THIS FORMATION THAT LOOKS LIKE A TRICERATOPS EXCEPT IT 'S BIGGER AND IT 'S CALLED TOROSAURUS
JackHorner_2010X SO ONE OF MY GRADUATE STUDENTS JOHN SCANNELLA
JackHorner_2010X THE HOLE STARTING TO FORM IN TRICERATOPS AND
JackHorner_2010X OF COURSE IT 'S OPEN IN TOROSAURUS SO HE FOUND THE TRANSITIONAL ONES BETWEEN TRICERATOPS AND TOROSAURUS WHICH WAS PRETTY COOL SO NOW WE KNOW THAT TOROSAURUS
JackHorner_2010X IS ACTUALLY A GROWNUP TRICERATOPS
JackHorner_2010X NOW WHEN WE NAME DINOSAURS WHEN WE NAME ANYTHING THE ORIGINAL NAME GETS TO STICK AND THE SECOND NAME IS
JackHorner_2010X THROWN OUT SO
JackHorner_2010X TOROSAURUS IS EXTINCT
JackHorner_2010X TRICERATOPS IF YOU 'VE HEARD THE NEWS A LOT OF THE NEWSCASTERS GOT IT ALL WRONG THEY THOUGHT TOROSAURUS SHOULD BE KEPT AND TRICERATOPS THROWN OUT
JackHorner_2010X WE LOOK AT THE BONE HISTOLOGY THE BONE HISTOLOGY TELLS US THAT EDMONTOSAURUS IS A JUVENILE OR AT LEAST A SUB ADULT AND THE OTHER ONE IS
JackHorner_2010X SO WE CAN JUST KEEP DOING THIS AND THE LAST ONE IS
JackHorner_2010X IT MUST BE TRUE THEY MUST BE DIFFERENT
JackHorner_2010X AND SURE ENOUGH NANOTYRANNUS HAS JUVENILE BONE AND
JackHorner_2010X THE BIGGER ONE HAS MORE MATURE BONE
JackHorner_2010X IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD STILL GET BIGGER AND AT THE MUSEUM OF THE ROCKIES WHERE WE WORK I HAVE FOUR T REXES SO I CAN CUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM BUT I DIDN 'T HAVE TO CUT ANY OF THEM REALLY BECAUSE I JUST LINED UP THEIR JAWS
JackHorner_2010X AND IT TURNED OUT THE BIGGEST ONE HAD TWELVE TEETH AND THE NEXT SMALLEST ONE HAD THIRTEEN AND THE NEXT SMALLEST HAD FOURTEEN
JackHorner_2010X AND OF COURSE NANO HAS SEVENTEEN AND WE JUST WENT OUT AND LOOKED AT OTHER PEOPLE 'S COLLECTIONS AND WE FOUND ONE THAT
JackHorner_2010X HAS SORT OF FIFTEEN TEETH
JackHorner_2010X SO AGAIN
JackHorner_2010X REAL EASY TO SAY THAT
JackHorner_2010X WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO OUR
JackHorner_2010X END CRETACEOUS WE HAVE SEVEN LEFT
JackHorner_2010X AND THEY 'RE NOT HAPPY WITH
