EvaVertes_2005 REALLY AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE SPENDING MY LAST DAY AS A TEENAGER TODAY I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE FUTURE BUT FIRST I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A BIT ABOUT THE PAST
EvaVertes_2005 MY STORY STARTS WAY BEFORE I WAS BORN MY GRANDMOTHER WAS ON A TRAIN TO AUSCHWITZ THE DEATH CAMP AND
EvaVertes_2005 MY GRANDMOTHER SURVIVED
EvaVertes_2005 THEY GOT ON A BOAT AND YET ANOTHER DIVERGENCE THE BOAT WAS EITHER GOING TO CANADA OR TO AUSTRALIA THEY GOT ON AND DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THEY WERE GOING AND ENDED UP
EvaVertes_2005 TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT THEY CAME TO CANADA MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A CHEMIST SHE WORKED AT THE BANTING INSTITUTE IN TORONTO
EvaVertes_2005 AND AT FORTY FOUR SHE DIED OF STOMACH CANCER I
EvaVertes_2005 I FOUND THIS PASSION NOT FAR FROM HERE ACTUALLY WHEN I WAS NINE YEARS OLD MY FAMILY WAS ON A ROAD TRIP AND WE WERE IN THE GRAND CANYON AND
EvaVertes_2005 AND MY MOTHER BOUGHT THIS BOOK WHEN WE WERE AT THE GRAND CANYON CALLED THE HOT ZONE IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE OUTBREAK OF THE EBOLA VIRUS AND SOMETHING ABOUT IT JUST KIND OF DREW ME TOWARDS IT THERE WAS THIS BIG SORT OF BUMPY LOOKING VIRUS ON THE COVER AND
EvaVertes_2005 I JUST WANTED TO READ IT I PICKED UP THAT BOOK AND AS WE DROVE FROM THE EDGE OF THE GRAND CANYON TO BIG SUR AND TO ACTUALLY HERE WHERE WE ARE TODAY IN MONTEREY I READ THAT BOOK AND FROM
EvaVertes_2005 WHEN I WAS READING THAT BOOK I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO HAVE A LIFE IN MEDICINE I WANTED TO BE LIKE THE EXPLORERS I'D READ ABOUT IN THE BOOK WHO WENT INTO THE JUNGLES OF AFRICA WENT INTO THE RESEARCH LABS AND JUST TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS DEADLY VIRUS
EvaVertes_2005 SO FROM THAT MOMENT ON I READ EVERY MEDICAL BOOK I COULD GET MY HANDS ON AND
EvaVertes_2005 MAYBE NOW YOU KNOW BEING A BIG HIGH SCHOOL KID I CAN MAYBE BECOME AN ACTIVE PART OF THIS BIG MEDICAL WORLD
EvaVertes_2005 I WAS FOURTEEN AND I EMAILED PROFESSORS AT THE LOCAL UNIVERSITY TO SEE IF MAYBE I COULD GO WORK IN THEIR LAB AND
EvaVertes_2005 AND I GOT TO GO TALK TO ONE PROFESSOR DOCTOR JACOBS WHO ACCEPTED ME INTO THE LAB AT THAT TIME I WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN
EvaVertes_2005 I STARTED THAT AND WORKED IN HIS LAB FOR A YEAR AND FOUND THE RESULTS THAT I GUESS YOU'D EXPECT TO FIND WHEN YOU FEED FRUIT FLIES HEAVY METALS THAT IT REALLY REALLY IMPAIRED THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
EvaVertes_2005 THE SPINAL CORD HAD BREAKS THE NEURONS WERE CROSSING IN EVERY WHICH WAY AND FROM THEN I WANTED TO LOOK NOT AT IMPAIRMENT BUT AT PREVENTION OF IMPAIRMENT
EvaVertes_2005 SO THAT'S WHAT LED ME INTO ALZHEIMER 'S I STARTED READING ABOUT ALZHEIMER 'S AND TRIED TO FAMILIARIZE MYSELF WITH THE RESEARCH
EvaVertes_2005 AND AT THE SAME TIME WHEN I WAS IN THE I WAS READING IN THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ONE DAY AND I READ THIS ARTICLE ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED PURINE DERIVATIVES
EvaVertes_2005 AND THEY SEEMED TO HAVE CELL GROWTH PROMOTING PROPERTIES AND BEING NAIVE ABOUT THE WHOLE FIELD I KIND OF THOUGHT OH YOU HAVE CELL DEATH IN ALZHEIMER 'S WHICH IS CAUSING THE MEMORY DEFICIT AND THEN YOU HAVE
EvaVertes_2005 THIS COMPOUND PURINE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE PROMOTING CELL GROWTH AND SO I THOUGHT MAYBE IF IT CAN PROMOTE CELL GROWTH IT CAN INHIBIT CELL DEATH TOO AND SO THAT'S THE PROJECT THAT I
EvaVertes_2005 AND THERE I WAS AWARDED BEST IN THE WORLD IN MEDICINE WHICH ALLOWED ME TO GET IN OR AT LEAST GET A FOOT IN THE DOOR OF THE BIG MEDICAL WORLD AND
EvaVertes_2005 FROM THEN ON SINCE I WAS NOW IN THIS HUGE EXCITING WORLD I WANTED TO EXPLORE IT ALL I WANTED IT ALL AT ONCE BUT KNEW I COULDN'T REALLY GET
EvaVertes_2005 AND I STUMBLED ACROSS SOMETHING CALLED CANCER STEM CELLS AND THIS IS REALLY WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY ABOUT CANCER
EvaVertes_2005 CANCER STEM CELLS I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO PUT THE TWO TOGETHER I'D HEARD OF STEM CELLS AND I'D HEARD OF THEM AS THE PANACEA OF THE FUTURE
EvaVertes_2005 THE THERAPY OF MANY DISEASES TO COME IN THE FUTURE PERHAPS BUT I'D HEARD OF CANCER AS THE MOST FEARED DISEASE OF OUR TIME SO HOW DID THE GOOD AND BAD GO TOGETHER
EvaVertes_2005 THIS NEW MEDICAL FIELD AND IT SEEMED THAT TUMORS ACTUALLY BEGIN FROM A
EvaVertes_2005 THIS FASCINATED ME THE MORE I READ THE MORE I LOOKED AT CANCER DIFFERENTLY AND ALMOST BECAME LESS FEARFUL OF IT
EvaVertes_2005 IT SEEMS THAT CANCER IS A DIRECT RESULT TO INJURY IF YOU SMOKE YOU DAMAGE YOUR LUNG TISSUE AND THEN
EvaVertes_2005 WHAT STEM CELLS ARE THEY'RE THESE PHENOMENAL CELLS THAT REALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DIFFERENTIATE INTO ANY TYPE OF TISSUE SO
EvaVertes_2005 THE BODY IS SENSING THAT YOU HAVE DAMAGE TO AN ORGAN AND THEN IT'S INITIATING CANCER IT'S ALMOST AS IF THIS IS A REPAIR RESPONSE
EvaVertes_2005 AND THE CANCER THE BODY IS SAYING THE LUNG TISSUE IS DAMAGED WE NEED TO REPAIR THE LUNG AND CANCER IS ORIGINATING IN THE LUNG
EvaVertes_2005 TRYING TO REPAIR BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS EXCESSIVE PROLIFERATION OF THESE REMARKABLE CELLS THAT REALLY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME LUNG TISSUE BUT
EvaVertes_2005 SO THIS REALLY REALLY FASCINATED ME AND I REALLY THINK THAT WE CAN'T THINK ABOUT CANCER LET ALONE ANY DISEASE IN SUCH BLACK AND WHITE TERMS
EvaVertes_2005 IF WE ELIMINATE CANCER THE WAY WE'RE TRYING TO DO NOW WITH CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION WE'RE BOMBARDING THE BODY OR THE CANCER WITH TOXINS OR WITH RADIATION TRYING TO KILL
EvaVertes_2005 IT'S ALMOST AS IF WE'RE GETTING BACK TO THIS STARTING POINT WE'RE REMOVING THE CANCER CELLS BUT WE'RE REVEALING THE PREVIOUS DAMAGE THAT THE BODY HAS TRIED TO FIX
EvaVertes_2005 WE THINK ABOUT MANIPULATION RATHER THAN ELIMINATION IF SOMEHOW WE CAN
EvaVertes_2005 CELLS TO DIFFERENTIATE TO BECOME BONE TISSUE LUNG TISSUE LIVER TISSUE WHATEVER THAT CANCER HAS BEEN PUT THERE TO DO
EvaVertes_2005 IT WOULD BE A REPAIR PROCESS WE'D END UP BETTER THAN WE WERE BEFORE CANCER SO THIS REALLY CHANGED MY VIEW OF LOOKING AT CANCER
EvaVertes_2005 AND WHILE I WAS READING ALL THESE ARTICLES ABOUT CANCER IT SEEMED THAT THE ARTICLES A LOT OF THEM FOCUSED ON YOU KNOW THE GENETICS OF BREAST CANCER AND THE GENESIS AND THE PROGRESSION OF BREAST CANCER TRACKING THE CANCER THROUGH THE BODY TRACING WHERE IT IS WHERE IT GOES
EvaVertes_2005 IT STRUCK ME THAT I'D NEVER HEARD OF
EvaVertes_2005 NOT ONLY TO CANCER BUT OF METASTASIS GOING TO SKELETAL MUSCLE AND WHAT METASTASES ARE IS WHEN THE TUMOR WHEN A PIECE BREAKS OFF AND TRAVELS THROUGH THE
EvaVertes_2005 AND GOES TO A DIFFERENT ORGAN THAT'S WHAT A METASTASIS IS IT'S THE PART OF CANCER THAT IS THE MOST DANGEROUS IF CANCER WAS LOCALIZED
EvaVertes_2005 WE COULD LIKELY REMOVE IT OR SOMEHOW YOU KNOW IT'S CONTAINED IT'S VERY CONTAINED BUT ONCE IT STARTS MOVING THROUGHOUT THE BODY THAT'S WHEN IT BECOMES DEADLY SO THE FACT THAT
EvaVertes_2005 NOT ONLY DID CANCER NOT SEEM TO ORIGINATE IN SKELETAL MUSCLES BUT CANCER DIDN'T SEEM TO GO TO SKELETAL MUSCLE THERE SEEMED TO BE SOMETHING HERE SO THESE ARTICLES WERE SAYING YOU KNOW SKELETAL
EvaVertes_2005 I DECIDED TO ASK WHY AT FIRST THE FIRST THING I DID WAS I EMAILED SOME
EvaVertes_2005 YOU HAVE MUSCLE CELLS BUT THEY'RE NOT DIVIDING SO IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A GOOD TARGET FOR CANCER TO HIJACK BUT THEN AGAIN THIS FACT THAT THE METASTASIS DIDN'T GO TO SKELETAL MUSCLE
EvaVertes_2005 MADE THAT SEEM UNLIKELY AND FURTHERMORE NERVOUS TISSUE BRAIN GETS
EvaVertes_2005 THAT I'LL BE STARTING TO INVESTIGATE THIS MAY AT THE SYLVESTER CANCER INSTITUTE IN MIAMI AND
EvaVertes_2005 I GUESS I'LL KEEP INVESTIGATING UNTIL I GET THE ANSWERS BUT I KNOW THAT IN SCIENCE ONCE YOU GET THE ANSWERS INEVITABLY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE QUESTIONS SO I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT
EvaVertes_2005 BLOOD VESSELS ARE LIKE HIGHWAYS FOR THE TUMOR CELLS TUMOR CELLS CAN TRAVEL THROUGH THE BLOOD VESSELS AND YOU THINK THE MORE HIGHWAYS THERE ARE IN A TISSUE THE MORE LIKELY IT IS TO GET CANCER OR TO GET
EvaVertes_2005 SO FIRST OF ALL I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WOULDN 'T IT BE FAVORABLE TO CANCER GETTING TO SKELETAL MUSCLE AND AS WELL CANCER
EvaVertes_2005 A PROCESS CALLED ANGIOGENESIS WHICH IS REALLY THE TUMOR RECRUITS THE BLOOD VESSELS TO ITSELF TO SUPPLY ITSELF WITH NUTRIENTS SO IT CAN GROW
EvaVertes_2005 WITHOUT ANGIOGENESIS THE TUMOR REMAINS THE SIZE OF A PINPOINT AND IT'S NOT HARMFUL
EvaVertes_2005 IS REALLY A CENTRAL PROCESS TO THE PATHOGENESIS OF CANCER AND ONE ARTICLE THAT REALLY STOOD OUT TO ME WHEN I WAS JUST READING ABOUT THIS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY CANCER DOESN'T GO TO SKELETAL MUSCLE WAS THAT
EvaVertes_2005 SIXTEEN PERCENT OF MICRO METASTASES TO SKELETAL MUSCLE UPON AUTOPSY SIXTEEN PERCENT
EvaVertes_2005 MEANING THAT THERE WERE THESE PINPOINT TUMORS IN SKELETAL MUSCLE BUT ONLY POINT ONE SIX PERCENT OF ACTUAL
EvaVertes_2005 MUSCLE SOMEHOW INTUITIVELY KNOWS THAT IT NEEDS THIS BLOOD SUPPLY IT NEEDS TO BE CONSTANTLY CONTRACTING SO THEREFORE IT'S ALMOST SELFISH IT'S GRABBING ITS BLOOD VESSELS FOR ITSELF THEREFORE WHEN A TUMOR COMES INTO SKELETAL MUSCLE TISSUE
EvaVertes_2005 IT CAN'T GET A BLOOD SUPPLY AND CAN'T GROW SO THIS SUGGESTS THAT MAYBE IF THERE IS AN ANTI ANGIOGENIC FACTOR IN SKELETAL MUSCLE
EvaVertes_2005 EVEN MORE AN ANGIOGENIC ROUTING FACTOR SO IT CAN ACTUALLY DIRECT WHERE THE BLOOD VESSELS GROW THIS COULD BE A POTENTIAL FUTURE THERAPY FOR CANCER
EvaVertes_2005 AND ANOTHER THING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT THERE'S THIS WHOLE THE WAY
EvaVertes_2005 TUMORS MOVE THROUGHOUT THE BODY IT'S A VERY COMPLEX SYSTEM AND THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THE CHEMOKINE NETWORK AND CHEMOKINES ARE ESSENTIALLY CHEMICAL ATTRACTANTS AND THEY'RE THE STOP AND GO SIGNALS FOR CANCER
EvaVertes_2005 SO A TUMOR EXPRESSES CHEMOKINE RECEPTORS AND ANOTHER ORGAN A DISTANT ORGAN SOMEWHERE IN THE BODY WILL HAVE THE CORRESPONDING CHEMOKINES AND THE TUMOR WILL SEE THESE CHEMOKINES AND MIGRATE TOWARDS IT
EvaVertes_2005 IS IT POSSIBLE THAT SKELETAL MUSCLE DOESN'T EXPRESS THESE TYPES OF MOLECULES AND THE OTHER REALLY INTERESTING THING IS THAT
EvaVertes_2005 WHEN SKELETAL MUSCLE THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL REPORTS THAT WHEN SKELETAL MUSCLE IS INJURED THAT'S WHAT CORRELATES WITH METASTASIS GOING TO SKELETAL MUSCLE
EvaVertes_2005 AND FURTHERMORE WHEN SKELETAL MUSCLE IS INJURED THAT'S WHAT CAUSES CHEMOKINES THESE SIGNALS SAYING
EvaVertes_2005 CANCER YOU CAN COME TO ME THE GO SIGNS FOR THE TUMORS IT CAUSES THEM TO HIGHLY EXPRESS THESE
EvaVertes_2005 SO THERE'S SO MUCH INTERPLAY HERE
EvaVertes_2005 I MEAN THERE ARE SO MANY POSSIBILITIES FOR WHY TUMORS DON'T GO TO SKELETAL MUSCLE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
EvaVertes_2005 BY INVESTIGATING BY ATTACKING CANCER BY SEARCHING WHERE CANCER IS NOT THERE HAS GOT TO BE SOMETHING THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING
EvaVertes_2005 MAKING THIS TISSUE RESISTANT TO TUMORS AND CAN WE UTILIZE CAN WE TAKE THIS PROPERTY THIS COMPOUND THIS
EvaVertes_2005 CANCER THERAPY IN GENERAL NOW ONE THING THAT KIND OF
EvaVertes_2005 RESISTANCE OF SKELETAL MUSCLE TO CANCER TO THE CANCER AS A REPAIR RESPONSE GONE OUT OF CONTROL IN THE BODY IS THAT
EvaVertes_2005 MUSCLE HAS A FACTOR IN IT CALLED MYOD AND WHAT MYOD ESSENTIALLY DOES IS IT CAUSES CELLS TO DIFFERENTIATE INTO MUSCLE CELLS
EvaVertes_2005 SO THIS COMPOUND MYOD HAS BEEN TESTED ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT CELL TYPES AND BEEN SHOWN TO ACTUALLY CONVERT THIS VARIETY OF CELL TYPES INTO SKELETAL MUSCLE CELLS
EvaVertes_2005 SO IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE TUMOR CELLS
EvaVertes_2005 GOING TO THE SKELETAL MUSCLE TISSUE BUT ONCE IN CONTACT INSIDE THE SKELETAL MUSCLE TISSUE MYOD ACTS UPON THESE TUMOR CELLS AND CAUSES THEM TO BECOME
EvaVertes_2005 MAYBE TUMOR CELLS ARE BEING DISGUISED AS SKELETAL MUSCLE CELLS AND THIS IS WHY IT SEEMS AS IF IT IS SO RARE IT'S NOT HARMFUL IT HAS JUST REPAIRED THE MUSCLE
EvaVertes_2005 HAVE CANCER ALMOST AND I HATE TO SAY THAT BUT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH MUSCLE CELL POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF ALL ITS USE HAS ADAPTED FASTER THAN OTHER BODY TISSUES
EvaVertes_2005 TO RESPOND TO INJURY TO FINE TUNE THIS REPAIR RESPONSE AND ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO FINISH THE PROCESS
EvaVertes_2005 WHICH THE BODY WANTS TO FINISH I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE HUMAN BODY IS VERY VERY SMART AND WE CAN'T
EvaVertes_2005 FOREIGN OBJECT WE WANT THAT OUT BUT WHEN THE BODY IS ACTUALLY INITIATING A PROCESS AND WE'RE CALLING IT A DISEASE IT DOESN'T SEEM AS THOUGH ELIMINATION IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION
EvaVertes_2005 SO EVEN TO GO FROM THERE IT'S
EvaVertes_2005 POSSIBLE ALTHOUGH FAR FETCHED THAT IN THE FUTURE WE COULD ALMOST THINK OF CANCER BEING USED AS A THERAPY
EvaVertes_2005 IF THOSE DISEASES WHERE TISSUES ARE DETERIORATING FOR EXAMPLE ALZHEIMER 'S WHERE THE BRAIN THE BRAIN CELLS DIE AND WE NEED TO RESTORE NEW BRAIN CELLS NEW FUNCTIONAL BRAIN CELLS
EvaVertes_2005 WHAT IF WE COULD IN THE FUTURE USE CANCER A TUMOR PUT IT IN THE BRAIN AND CAUSE IT TO DIFFERENTIATE INTO BRAIN CELLS
EvaVertes_2005 FETCHED IDEA BUT I REALLY BELIEVE THAT IT MAY BE POSSIBLE THESE CELLS ARE SO VERSATILE THESE CANCER CELLS ARE SO VERSATILE WE JUST HAVE TO MANIPULATE THEM IN THE RIGHT WAY
EvaVertes_2005 AND AGAIN SOME OF THESE MAY BE FAR FETCHED BUT I FIGURED IF THERE'S ANYWHERE TO PRESENT FAR FETCHED IDEAS IT'S HERE AT TED
