DonNorman_2003 THE NEW ME IS BEAUTY
DonNorman_2003 YEAH PEOPLE USED TO SAY YOU KNOW NORMAN'S OK BUT IF YOU FOLLOWED WHAT HE SAID EVERYTHING WOULD BE USABLE BUT IT WOULD BE UGLY WELL I DIDN'T HAVE THAT IN MIND SO
DonNorman_2003 THIS IS NEAT THANK YOU FOR SETTING UP MY DISPLAY I MEAN IT'S JUST WONDERFUL
DonNorman_2003 THE NEW ME IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THINGS KIND OF NEAT AND FUN AND SO THIS IS A PHILIPPE STARCK JUICER PRODUCED BY ALESSI IT'S SO MUCH FUN I HAVE IT IN MY HOUSE BUT I HAVE IT IN THE ENTRYWAY I DON'T USE IT TO MAKE
DonNorman_2003 IN FACT I BOUGHT THE GOLD PLATED SPECIAL EDITION AND IT COMES WITH A LITTLE SLIP OF PAPER THAT SAYS DON 'T USE THIS JUICER TO MAKE JUICE THE
DonNorman_2003 ACID WILL RUIN THE GOLD PLATING SO ACTUALLY I TOOK A CARTON OF ORANGE JUICE AND I POURED IT IN THE GLASS TO TAKE THIS PICTURE
DonNorman_2003 BUT BENEATH IT IS A WONDERFUL KNIFE IT'S A GLOBAL CUTTING KNIFE MADE IN JAPAN FIRST OF ALL LOOK AT THE SHAPE IT'S JUST WONDERFUL TO LOOK AT
DonNorman_2003 SECOND OF ALL IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL BALANCED IT HOLDS FEELS WELL AND THIRD OF ALL IT'S SO SHARP IT JUST CUTS IT'S A DELIGHT TO USE
DonNorman_2003 AND THOSE ARE THE THREE COMPONENTS HIROSHI ISHII AND HIS GROUP AT THE MIT MEDIA LAB TOOK A PING PONG TABLE AND A PROJECTOR ABOVE IT AND ON THE PING PONG TABLE THEY PROJECTED AN IMAGE OF WATER AND FISH SWIMMING IN IT
DonNorman_2003 AND AS YOU PLAY PING PONG WHENEVER THE BALL HITS PART OF THE TABLE THE RIPPLES SPREAD OUT AND THE FISH RUN AWAY BUT OF COURSE THEN THE BALL HITS THE OTHER SIDE RIPPLES HIT THE POOR FISH THEY CAN'T FIND ANY PEACE AND QUIET
DonNorman_2003 AND IS THAT A GOOD WAY TO PLAY PING PONG NO BUT IS IT FUN YEAH YEAH SO OR LOOK AT GOOGLE IF YOU TYPE IN OH SAY EMOTION AND DESIGN
DonNorman_2003 GET TEN PAGES OF RESULTS SO GOOGLE JUST TOOK THEIR LOGO AND THEY SPREAD IT OUT INSTEAD OF SAYING YOU GOT SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND RESULTS THIS ONE THROUGH TWENTY NEXT
DonNorman_2003 THEY JUST GIVE YOU AS MANY O 'S AS THERE ARE PAGES IT'S REALLY SIMPLE AND SUBTLE I BET A LOT OF YOU HAVE SEEN IT AND NEVER NOTICED IT
DonNorman_2003 THE WEIRD THING IS GOOGLE LIES BECAUSE IF I TYPE DESIGN AND EMOTION IT SAYS YOU DON'T NEED THE AND WE DO IT ANYWAY
DonNorman_2003 OK SO I TYPE DESIGN EMOTION AND MY WEBSITE WASN'T FIRST AGAIN IT WAS THIRD OH WELL
DonNorman_2003 THIS WONDERFUL REVIEW IN THE NEW YORK TIMES ABOUT THE MINI COOPER AUTOMOBILE IT SAID YOU KNOW THIS IS A CAR THAT HAS LOTS OF FAULTS BUY IT ANYWAY IT'S SO MUCH FUN TO DRIVE
DonNorman_2003 AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE INSIDE OF THE CAR I MEAN I WANTED TO SEE I RENTED IT THIS IS ME TAKING A PICTURE WHILE MY SON IS DRIVING AND
DonNorman_2003 THE INSIDE OF THE CAR THE WHOLE DESIGN IS FUN IT'S ROUND IT'S NEAT THE CONTROLS WORK WONDERFULLY SO THAT'S MY NEW LIFE IT'S ALL ABOUT
DonNorman_2003 I REALLY HAVE THE FEELING THAT PLEASANT THINGS WORK BETTER AND THAT NEVER MADE ANY SENSE TO ME UNTIL I FINALLY FIGURED OUT LOOK
DonNorman_2003 THE GROUND SO IMAGINE I HAVE A PLANK ABOUT TWO FEET WIDE AND THIRTY FEET LONG AND I'M GOING TO WALK ON IT AND YOU SEE I CAN WALK ON IT WITHOUT LOOKING I CAN GO BACK AND FORTH AND I CAN JUMP UP AND DOWN NO PROBLEM
DonNorman_2003 HE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE IT DOWN UNTIL JUST A FEW DAYS OR HOURS BEFORE THE TALK AND THAT ANXIETY WAS REALLY HELPFUL IN CAUSING HIM TO FOCUS AND THAT'S WHAT FEAR AND ANXIETY DOES
DonNorman_2003 IT CAUSES YOU TO BE WHAT'S CALLED DEPTH FIRST PROCESSING TO FOCUS NOT BE DISTRACTED AND I COULDN'T FORCE MYSELF ACROSS THAT NOW SOME PEOPLE CAN CIRCUS WORKERS STEEL WORKERS BUT IT REALLY CHANGES THE WAY YOU THINK
DonNorman_2003 AND THEN A PSYCHOLOGIST ALICE ISEN DID THIS WONDERFUL EXPERIMENT SHE BROUGHT STUDENTS IN TO SOLVE PROBLEMS SO SHE'D BRING PEOPLE INTO THE ROOM THERE'D BE A STRING HANGING DOWN HERE
DonNorman_2003 AND A STRING HANGING DOWN HERE AND AN EMPTY ROOM EXCEPT A TABLE WITH A BUNCH OF CRAP ON IT SOME PAPERS AND SCISSORS AND STUFF AND SHE'D BRING THEM IN AND SHE'D SAY
DonNorman_2003 THIS IS AN IQ TEST AND IT DETERMINES HOW WELL YOU DO IN LIFE WOULD YOU TIE THOSE TWO STRINGS TOGETHER SO THEY'D TAKE ONE STRING AND THEY'D PULL IT OVER HERE AND
DonNorman_2003 THE OTHER STRING STILL CAN'T REACH IT AND BASICALLY NONE OF THEM COULD SOLVE IT
DonNorman_2003 AND I DON'T EAT CANDY WOULD YOU LIKE THE BOX OF CANDY AND TURNS OUT THEY LIKED IT AND IT MADE THEM HAPPY NOT VERY HAPPY BUT A LITTLE BIT OF HAPPY AND GUESS WHAT THEY SOLVED THE PROBLEM
DonNorman_2003 AND IT TURNS OUT THAT WHEN YOU'RE ANXIOUS YOU SQUIRT NEURAL TRANSMITTERS IN THE BRAIN WHICH FOCUSES YOU MAKES YOU DEPTH FIRST AND WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY
DonNorman_2003 WHAT WE CALL POSITIVE VALENCE YOU SQUIRT DOPAMINE INTO THE PREFRONTAL LOBES WHICH MAKES YOU A BREADTH FIRST PROBLEM SOLVER YOU'RE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO INTERRUPTION YOU DO OUT OF THE BOX THINKING
DonNorman_2003 THAT'S WHAT BRAINSTORMING 'S ABOUT RIGHT WITH BRAINSTORMING WE MAKE YOU HAPPY WE PLAY GAMES AND WE SAY NO CRITICISM AND YOU GET ALL THESE WEIRD NEAT IDEAS
DonNorman_2003 BUT IN FACT IF THAT'S HOW YOU ALWAYS WERE YOU'D NEVER GET ANY WORK DONE BECAUSE YOU'D BE WORKING ALONG AND SAY OH I GOT A NEW WAY OF DOING IT SO TO GET WORK DONE YOU'VE GOT TO SET A DEADLINE RIGHT
DonNorman_2003 BE ANXIOUS SO THE BRAIN WORKS DIFFERENTLY AND IF YOU'RE HAPPY THINGS WORK BETTER BECAUSE YOU'RE MORE CREATIVE YOU GET A LITTLE PROBLEM YOU SAY AH I'LL FIGURE IT OUT NO BIG DEAL
DonNorman_2003 THERE'S SOMETHING I CALL THE VISCERAL LEVEL OF PROCESSING BIOLOGY WE HAVE CO ADAPTED THROUGH BIOLOGY TO LIKE BRIGHT COLORS THAT'S ESPECIALLY GOOD THAT MAMMALS AND PRIMATES LIKE FRUITS AND BRIGHT PLANTS BECAUSE YOU EAT THE FRUIT AND YOU THEREBY SPREAD THE SEED
DonNorman_2003 AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF STUFF THAT'S BUILT INTO THE BRAIN WE DISLIKE BITTER TASTES WE DISLIKE LOUD SOUNDS WE DISLIKE HOT TEMPERATURES COLD TEMPERATURES
DonNorman_2003 WE DISLIKE SCOLDING VOICES WE DISLIKE FROWNING FACES WE LIKE SYMMETRICAL FACES ET CETERA ET CETERA
DonNorman_2003 FALLS APART ALL THE TIME BUT THE OWNERS LOVE IT AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL IT'S IN THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART A WATER BOTTLE YOU BUY IT BECAUSE OF THE BOTTLE NOT BECAUSE OF THE WATER
DonNorman_2003 AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE FINISHED THEY DON'T THROW IT AWAY THEY KEEP IT FOR YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE THE OLD WINE BOTTLES YOU KEEP IT FOR DECORATION OR MAYBE FILL IT WITH WATER AGAIN WHICH PROVES IT'S NOT THE WATER IT'S ALL ABOUT THE VISCERAL EXPERIENCE
DonNorman_2003 THE MIDDLE LEVEL OF PROCESSING IS THE BEHAVIORAL LEVEL AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHERE MOST OF OUR STUFF GETS DONE VISCERAL IS SUBCONSCIOUS YOU'RE UNAWARE OF IT
DonNorman_2003 MOST OF WHAT WE DO IS SUBCONSCIOUS AUTOMATIC BEHAVIOR SKILLED BEHAVIOR IS SUBCONSCIOUS CONTROLLED BY THE BEHAVIORAL SIDE AND BEHAVIORAL DESIGN IS ALL ABOUT FEELING IN CONTROL
DonNorman_2003 OR JUST DRIVING A HIGH PERFORMANCE SPORTS CAR OVER A DEMANDING CURB AGAIN FEELING THAT YOU ARE IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE ENVIRONMENT OR THE SENSUAL FEELING THIS IS A KOHLER SHOWER
DonNorman_2003 A WATERFALL SHOWER AND ACTUALLY ALL THOSE KNOBS BENEATH ARE ALSO SHOWER HEADS IT WILL SQUIRT YOU ALL AROUND AND YOU CAN STAY IN THAT SHOWER FOR HOURS AND NOT WASTE WATER BY THE WAY IT RECIRCULATES THE SAME DIRTY WATER
DonNorman_2003 THIS THIS IS A REALLY NEAT TEAPOT I FOUND AT HIGH TEA AT THE FOUR SEASONS HOTEL IN CHICAGO IT'S A RONNEFELDT TILTING TEAPOT THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THE TEAPOT LOOKS LIKE BUT THE WAY YOU USE IT
DonNorman_2003 IS YOU LAY IT ON ITS BACK AND YOU PUT TEA IN AND THEN YOU FILL IT WITH WATER BECAUSE WATER THEN SEEPS OVER THE TEA AND THE TEA IS SITTING
DonNorman_2003 AND THAT MEANS THE TEA IS PARTIALLY COVERED WHILE IT COMPLETES THE BREWING AND WHEN IT'S FINISHED YOU PUT IT VERTICALLY AND NOW THE TEA IS YOU REMEMBER ABOVE THIS LINE AND THE WATER ONLY COMES TO HERE AND SO IT KEEPS THE TEA OUT
DonNorman_2003 AND ON TOP OF THAT IT COMMUNICATES WHICH IS WHAT EMOTION DOES EMOTION IS ALL ABOUT ACTING EMOTION IS REALLY ABOUT ACTING IT'S BEING SAFE IN THE WORLD
DonNorman_2003 AND GETTING US READY TO ACT WHICH IS WHY THE MUSCLES TENSE OR RELAX AND THAT'S WHY WE CAN TELL THE EMOTION OF SOMEBODY ELSE BECAUSE THEIR MUSCLES ARE ACTING SUBCONSCIOUSLY
DonNorman_2003 WHAT A WONDERFUL DESIGN AND THE THIRD LEVEL IS REFLECTIVE WHICH IS IF YOU LIKE
DonNorman_2003 HEAD THAT'S WATCHING AND SAYING THAT 'S GOOD THAT'S BAD OR WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT'S THAT LITTLE VOICE IN YOUR HEAD THAT'S THE SEAT OF CONSCIOUSNESS
DonNorman_2003 HERE 'S A GREAT REFLECTIVE PRODUCT OWNERS OF THE HUMMER HAVE SAID YOU KNOW I'VE OWNED MANY CARS IN MY LIFE ALL SORTS OF EXOTIC CARS BUT NEVER HAVE I HAD A CAR THAT ATTRACTED SO MUCH ATTENTION IT'S ABOUT THEIR IMAGE IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CAR
DonNorman_2003 BUT EVEN IF YOU WANT A MORE POSITIVE MODEL THIS IS THE GM CAR AND THE REASON YOU MIGHT BUY IT NOW IS BECAUSE YOU CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND YOU'LL BUY IT TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT EVEN THOUGH THE FIRST FEW CARS ARE GOING TO BE REALLY EXPENSIVE
DonNorman_2003 AND NOT PERFECTED BUT THAT'S REFLECTIVE DESIGN AS WELL OR AN EXPENSIVE WATCH SO YOU CAN IMPRESS PEOPLE WHO SAY OH GEE I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD THAT
DonNorman_2003 AS OPPOSED TO THIS ONE WHICH IS A PURE BEHAVIORAL WATCH WHICH PROBABLY KEEPS BETTER TIME THAN THE THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR WATCH I JUST SHOWED YOU
DonNorman_2003 THIS IS A CLEAR DON NORMAN WATCH AND WHAT'S NEAT IS SOMETIMES YOU PIT ONE EMOTION AGAINST THE OTHER THE VISCERAL FEAR OF FALLING
DonNorman_2003 THE REFLECTIVE STATE SAYING IT 'S OK IT'S OK IT'S SAFE IT'S SAFE
DonNorman_2003 PARK WERE RUSTY AND FALLING APART YOU'D NEVER GO ON THE RIDE SO IT'S PITTING ONE AGAINST THE OTHER THE OTHER NEAT THING
DonNorman_2003 SO JAKE CRESS IS THIS FURNITURE MAKER AND HE MAKES THIS UNBELIEVABLE SET OF FURNITURE AND THIS IS HIS
DonNorman_2003 CLAW AND THE POOR LITTLE CHAIR HAS LOST ITS BALL
DonNorman_2003 TRYING TO GET IT BACK BEFORE ANYBODY NOTICES AND WHAT'S SO NEAT ABOUT IT IS HOW YOU ACCEPT THAT STORY AND THAT'S WHAT'S NICE ABOUT EMOTION SO THAT'S THE NEW ME I'M ONLY SAYING POSITIVE THINGS
