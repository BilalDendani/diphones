JinhaLee_2013 AND THIS GAP HAS BECOME SHORTER SHORTER AND EVEN SHORTER AND NOW THIS GAP IS SHORTENED DOWN TO LESS THAN A MILLIMETER THE THICKNESS OF A TOUCH SCREEN GLASS AND THE POWER OF COMPUTING HAS BECOME ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE
JinhaLee_2013 BUT I WONDERED WHAT IF THERE COULD BE NO BOUNDARY AT ALL I STARTED TO IMAGINE WHAT THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE FIRST
JinhaLee_2013 I CREATED THIS TOOL WHICH PENETRATES INTO THE DIGITAL SPACE SO WHEN YOU PRESS IT HARD ON THE SCREEN IT TRANSFERS ITS PHYSICAL BODY INTO PIXELS
JinhaLee_2013 NOW YOU CAN LIFT UP YOUR HANDS FROM THE KEYBOARD AND REACH INSIDE THIS THREE D SPACE
JinhaLee_2013 AND GRAB PIXELS WITH YOUR BARE HANDS
JinhaLee_2013 WHILE HIGHLIGHTING THE LINES WORDS ON THE VIRTUAL TOUCH PAD BELOW EACH FLOATING WINDOW ARCHITECTS CAN STRETCH OR ROTATE THE MODELS WITH THEIR TWO HANDS DIRECTLY SO IN THESE EXAMPLES WE ARE REACHING INTO THE DIGITAL WORLD
JinhaLee_2013 I 'M SURE MANY OF US HAVE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF BUYING AND RETURNING ITEMS ONLINE BUT NOW YOU DON 'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT WHAT I GOT HERE IS AN ONLINE AUGMENTED FITTING ROOM THIS IS A VIEW THAT YOU GET FROM HEAD MOUNTED OR SEE THROUGH DISPLAY WHEN THE SYSTEM UNDERSTANDS THE GEOMETRY OF YOUR BODY
JinhaLee_2013 TAKING THIS IDEA FURTHER I STARTED TO THINK INSTEAD OF JUST SEEING THESE PIXELS IN OUR SPACE HOW CAN WE MAKE IT PHYSICAL SO THAT WE CAN TOUCH AND FEEL IT
JinhaLee_2013 WHAT WOULD SUCH A FUTURE LOOK LIKE
JinhaLee_2013 AT MIT MEDIA LAB ALONG WITH MY ADVISOR HIROSHI ISHII AND MY COLLABORATOR REHMI POST
JinhaLee_2013 WE CREATED THIS ONE PHYSICAL PIXEL
JinhaLee_2013 WHICH MEANS THAT BOTH COMPUTERS AND PEOPLE CAN MOVE THIS OBJECT TO ANYWHERE WITHIN THIS LITTLE THREE D SPACE WHAT WE DID WAS ESSENTIALLY CANCELING GRAVITY
JinhaLee_2013 AND CONTROLLING THE MOVEMENT BY COMBINING MAGNETIC LEVITATION AND MECHANICAL ACTUATION AND SENSING TECHNOLOGIES AND BY DIGITALLY PROGRAMMING THE OBJECT WE ARE LIBERATING THE OBJECT FROM CONSTRAINTS OF TIME AND SPACE WHICH MEANS THAT NOW HUMAN MOTIONS CAN BE RECORDED AND PLAYED BACK
JinhaLee_2013 AND LEFT PERMANENTLY IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD
JinhaLee_2013 SO CHOREOGRAPHY CAN BE TAUGHT PHYSICALLY OVER DISTANCE AND MICHAEL JORDAN 'S FAMOUS SHOOTING CAN BE REPLICATED OVER AND OVER AS A PHYSICAL REALITY
JinhaLee_2013 STUDENTS CAN USE THIS AS A TOOL TO LEARN ABOUT THE COMPLEX CONCEPTS SUCH AS PLANETARY MOTION
JinhaLee_2013 AND UNLIKE COMPUTER SCREENS OR TEXTBOOKS THIS IS A REAL TANGIBLE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU CAN TOUCH AND FEEL AND IT 'S VERY POWERFUL
JinhaLee_2013 AND WHAT 'S MORE EXCITING
JinhaLee_2013 AS YOU CAN SEE THE DIGITAL INFORMATION WILL NOT JUST SHOW US SOMETHING BUT IT WILL START DIRECTLY ACTING UPON US AS A PART OF OUR PHYSICAL SURROUNDINGS WITHOUT DISCONNECTING OURSELVES FROM OUR WORLD
