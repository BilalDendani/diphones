TheoJansen_2007 I WOULD LIKE TO
TheoJansen_2007 TELL YOU ABOUT A PROJECT WHICH I STARTED ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS AGO AND IT'S ABOUT MAKING NEW FORMS OF LIFE
TheoJansen_2007 AND THESE ARE MADE OF THIS KIND OF
TheoJansen_2007 ELECTRICITY TUBE WE CALL IT IN HOLLAND AND WE CAN START A FILM
TheoJansen_2007 ABOUT THAT
TheoJansen_2007 I WANT
TheoJansen_2007 FORMS OF LIFE ON THE BEACHES AND THEY SHOULD SURVIVE OVER THERE ON THEIR OWN IN THE FUTURE
TheoJansen_2007 TO LIVE ON THEIR OWN
TheoJansen_2007 WALK ON THEIR OWN
TheoJansen_2007 THE MECHANICAL BEASTS WILL NOT GET THEIR ENERGY FROM FOOD BUT FROM THE WIND
TheoJansen_2007 THE WIND WILL MOVE FEATHERS ON THEIR BACK WHICH WILL DRIVE THEIR FEET
TheoJansen_2007 THE BEAST WALKS SIDEWAYS ON THE WET SAND OF THE BEACH WITH ITS NOSE POINTED INTO THE WIND
TheoJansen_2007 AND WALKS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
TheoJansen_2007 IS A HERD AND
TheoJansen_2007 IT IS BUILT ACCORDING GENETICAL CODES AND IT IS A SORT OF RACE AND EACH AND EVERY ANIMAL IS DIFFERENT AND THE WINNING CODES
TheoJansen_2007 THIS IS THE WAVE GOING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT YOU CAN SEE THIS ONE
TheoJansen_2007 AND NOW IT GOES FROM YES NOW IT GOES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT THIS IS A NEW GENERATION A NEW FAMILY WHICH IS ABLE TO STORE
TheoJansen_2007 SO THE WINGS PUMP UP AIR IN LEMONADE BOTTLES WHICH ARE ON TOP OF THAT AND THEY CAN USE THAT ENERGY
TheoJansen_2007 IN CASE THE WIND FALLS AWAY AND THE TIDE IS COMING UP AND THERE IS STILL A LITTLE BIT OF ENERGY TO REACH THE DUNES AND SAVE THEIR LIVES
TheoJansen_2007 BECAUSE THEY ARE DROWNED VERY EASILY
TheoJansen_2007 I COULD SHOW YOU THIS ANIMAL
TheoJansen_2007 THE PROPORTION OF THE TUBES IN THIS ANIMAL IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE WALKING
TheoJansen_2007 THERE ARE ELEVEN NUMBERS WHICH I CALL THE ELEVEN HOLY NUMBERS THESE ARE THE DISTANCES OF THE TUBES WHICH MAKES IT WALK THAT WAY IN FACT IT'S A NEW INVENTION OF THE WHEEL
TheoJansen_2007 IT WORKS THE SAME AS A WHEEL THE AXIS OF A WHEEL IS STAYING ON THE SAME LEVEL AND THIS HIP IS STAYING ON THE SAME LEVEL AS WELL
TheoJansen_2007 BETTER THAN A WHEEL BECAUSE WHEN YOU TRY TO DRIVE WITH YOUR BICYCLE ON THE BEACH YOU WILL NOTICE IT'S VERY
TheoJansen_2007 HARD TO DO AND
TheoJansen_2007 THE FEET JUST STEP OVER THE SAND
TheoJansen_2007 TO TOUCH EVERY PIECE OF THE GROUND IN BETWEEN
TheoJansen_2007 SO FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AFTER THE INVENTION OF THE WHEEL
TheoJansen_2007 VERY HEAVY LOADS CAN BE
TheoJansen_2007 THE
TheoJansen_2007 ON THE STORED WINDS IN THE BOTTLES IT HAS A FEELER WHERE IT CAN FEEL OBSTACLES AND TURN AROUND AND THAT STUFF YOU SEE IS GOING TO IT THE OTHER WAY
TheoJansen_2007 HAVE THE FEELER HERE
TheoJansen_2007 THEY HAVE TO SURVIVE ALL THE DANGERS OF THE BEACH
TheoJansen_2007 BIG DANGERS IS THE SEA THIS IS THE SEA
TheoJansen_2007 AND IT MUST
TheoJansen_2007 THE WATER
TheoJansen_2007 THIS IS THE WATER FEELER AND WHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IS THIS
TheoJansen_2007 IT SUCKS IN AIR NORMALLY
TheoJansen_2007 BUT WHEN IT SWALLOWS WATER IT FEELS THE RESISTANCE OF IT SO IMAGINE THAT THE ANIMAL IS WALKING
TheoJansen_2007 AS SOON AS IT TOUCHES THE WATER YOU SHOULD HEAR A SORT OF
TheoJansen_2007 SO IF IT DOESN'T FEEL IT WILL BE DROWNED OK
TheoJansen_2007 WE HAVE THE BRAIN OF THE ANIMAL
TheoJansen_2007 IN FACT IT IS A STEP COUNTER AND IT COUNTS THE STEPS IT'S A BINARY STEP COUNTER SO AS SOON IT HAS BEEN TO THE
TheoJansen_2007 IT CHANGES THE PATTERN OF ZEROES AND ONES HERE
TheoJansen_2007 IT KNOWS ALWAYS WHERE IT IS ON THE BEACH SO IT'S VERY SIMPLE BRAIN
TheoJansen_2007 THE BIGGEST
TheoJansen_2007 THE STORMS
TheoJansen_2007 THIS IS A PART OF THE NOSE OF
TheoJansen_2007 AND WHEN THE NOSE IS FIXED OF THE ANIMAL THE WHOLE ANIMAL IS FIXED
TheoJansen_2007 WHEN THE STORM IS COMING
TheoJansen_2007 THE WHOLE ANIMAL IS FIXED THE WIND MAY TURN BUT THE ANIMAL WILL TURN ALWAYS ITS NOSE INTO THE WIND
TheoJansen_2007 NOW ANOTHER COUPLE OF YEARS AND THESE ANIMALS WILL SURVIVE ON THEIR OWN I STILL HAVE TO HELP THEM A LOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
