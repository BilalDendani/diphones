TheoJansen_2007@12.95:13.89 I WOULD LIKE TO
TheoJansen_2007@14.71:23.63 TELL YOU ABOUT A PROJECT WHICH I STARTED ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS AGO AND IT'S ABOUT MAKING NEW FORMS OF LIFE
TheoJansen_2007@24.88:27.37 AND THESE ARE MADE OF THIS KIND OF
TheoJansen_2007@28.69:33.93 ELECTRICITY TUBE WE CALL IT IN HOLLAND AND WE CAN START A FILM
TheoJansen_2007@34.61:35.46 ABOUT THAT
TheoJansen_2007@50.51:51.02 I WANT
TheoJansen_2007@54.31:60.81 FORMS OF LIFE ON THE BEACHES AND THEY SHOULD SURVIVE OVER THERE ON THEIR OWN IN THE FUTURE
TheoJansen_2007@64.50:65.68 TO LIVE ON THEIR OWN
TheoJansen_2007@73.39:74.47 WALK ON THEIR OWN
TheoJansen_2007@77.04:81.44 THE MECHANICAL BEASTS WILL NOT GET THEIR ENERGY FROM FOOD BUT FROM THE WIND
TheoJansen_2007@82.25:85.82 THE WIND WILL MOVE FEATHERS ON THEIR BACK WHICH WILL DRIVE THEIR FEET
TheoJansen_2007@86.33:92.31 THE BEAST WALKS SIDEWAYS ON THE WET SAND OF THE BEACH WITH ITS NOSE POINTED INTO THE WIND
TheoJansen_2007@100.17:102.17 AND WALKS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
TheoJansen_2007@143.24:145.01 IS A HERD AND
TheoJansen_2007@145.79:155.00 IT IS BUILT ACCORDING GENETICAL CODES AND IT IS A SORT OF RACE AND EACH AND EVERY ANIMAL IS DIFFERENT AND THE WINNING CODES
TheoJansen_2007@156.62:160.27 THIS IS THE WAVE GOING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT YOU CAN SEE THIS ONE
TheoJansen_2007@164.76:172.85 AND NOW IT GOES FROM YES NOW IT GOES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT THIS IS A NEW GENERATION A NEW FAMILY WHICH IS ABLE TO STORE
TheoJansen_2007@174.25:182.80 SO THE WINGS PUMP UP AIR IN LEMONADE BOTTLES WHICH ARE ON TOP OF THAT AND THEY CAN USE THAT ENERGY
TheoJansen_2007@182.96:191.62 IN CASE THE WIND FALLS AWAY AND THE TIDE IS COMING UP AND THERE IS STILL A LITTLE BIT OF ENERGY TO REACH THE DUNES AND SAVE THEIR LIVES
TheoJansen_2007@193.01:194.68 BECAUSE THEY ARE DROWNED VERY EASILY
TheoJansen_2007@200.13:201.55 I COULD SHOW YOU THIS ANIMAL
TheoJansen_2007@218.35:224.66 THE PROPORTION OF THE TUBES IN THIS ANIMAL IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE WALKING
TheoJansen_2007@224.85:236.40 THERE ARE ELEVEN NUMBERS WHICH I CALL THE ELEVEN HOLY NUMBERS THESE ARE THE DISTANCES OF THE TUBES WHICH MAKES IT WALK THAT WAY IN FACT IT'S A NEW INVENTION OF THE WHEEL
TheoJansen_2007@236.77:244.99 IT WORKS THE SAME AS A WHEEL THE AXIS OF A WHEEL IS STAYING ON THE SAME LEVEL AND THIS HIP IS STAYING ON THE SAME LEVEL AS WELL
TheoJansen_2007@246.60:254.34 BETTER THAN A WHEEL BECAUSE WHEN YOU TRY TO DRIVE WITH YOUR BICYCLE ON THE BEACH YOU WILL NOTICE IT'S VERY
TheoJansen_2007@254.99:256.59 HARD TO DO AND
TheoJansen_2007@258.49:260.34 THE FEET JUST STEP OVER THE SAND
TheoJansen_2007@262.48:264.60 TO TOUCH EVERY PIECE OF THE GROUND IN BETWEEN
TheoJansen_2007@265.73:268.99 SO FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AFTER THE INVENTION OF THE WHEEL
TheoJansen_2007@277.33:279.02 VERY HEAVY LOADS CAN BE
TheoJansen_2007@289.55:289.75 THE
TheoJansen_2007@298.11:307.42 ON THE STORED WINDS IN THE BOTTLES IT HAS A FEELER WHERE IT CAN FEEL OBSTACLES AND TURN AROUND AND THAT STUFF YOU SEE IS GOING TO IT THE OTHER WAY
TheoJansen_2007@318.55:319.99 HAVE THE FEELER HERE
TheoJansen_2007@331.42:334.35 THEY HAVE TO SURVIVE ALL THE DANGERS OF THE BEACH
TheoJansen_2007@336.21:338.54 BIG DANGERS IS THE SEA THIS IS THE SEA
TheoJansen_2007@339.48:340.23 AND IT MUST
TheoJansen_2007@340.95:341.76 THE WATER
TheoJansen_2007@343.92:346.89 THIS IS THE WATER FEELER AND WHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IS THIS
TheoJansen_2007@348.17:351.85 IT SUCKS IN AIR NORMALLY
TheoJansen_2007@352.47:359.82 BUT WHEN IT SWALLOWS WATER IT FEELS THE RESISTANCE OF IT SO IMAGINE THAT THE ANIMAL IS WALKING
TheoJansen_2007@365.13:369.39 AS SOON AS IT TOUCHES THE WATER YOU SHOULD HEAR A SORT OF
TheoJansen_2007@384.12:388.49 SO IF IT DOESN'T FEEL IT WILL BE DROWNED OK
TheoJansen_2007@394.57:396.36 WE HAVE THE BRAIN OF THE ANIMAL
TheoJansen_2007@398.07:406.85 IN FACT IT IS A STEP COUNTER AND IT COUNTS THE STEPS IT'S A BINARY STEP COUNTER SO AS SOON IT HAS BEEN TO THE
TheoJansen_2007@409.68:413.09 IT CHANGES THE PATTERN OF ZEROES AND ONES HERE
TheoJansen_2007@415.67:420.74 IT KNOWS ALWAYS WHERE IT IS ON THE BEACH SO IT'S VERY SIMPLE BRAIN
TheoJansen_2007@434.11:435.26 THE BIGGEST
TheoJansen_2007@438.68:440.04 THE STORMS
TheoJansen_2007@441.37:443.64 THIS IS A PART OF THE NOSE OF
TheoJansen_2007@449.64:452.76 AND WHEN THE NOSE IS FIXED OF THE ANIMAL THE WHOLE ANIMAL IS FIXED
TheoJansen_2007@455.13:456.20 WHEN THE STORM IS COMING
TheoJansen_2007@468.23:473.10 THE WHOLE ANIMAL IS FIXED THE WIND MAY TURN BUT THE ANIMAL WILL TURN ALWAYS ITS NOSE INTO THE WIND
TheoJansen_2007@477.76:485.48 NOW ANOTHER COUPLE OF YEARS AND THESE ANIMALS WILL SURVIVE ON THEIR OWN I STILL HAVE TO HELP THEM A LOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
