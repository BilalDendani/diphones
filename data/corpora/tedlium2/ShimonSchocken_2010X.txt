ShimonSchocken_2010X IN ISRAEL
ShimonSchocken_2010X WHEN I'M ON MY BIKE I FEEL THAT I
ShimonSchocken_2010X THE PROFOUND BEAUTY OF
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND I FEEL THAT
ShimonSchocken_2010X WITH THIS COUNTRY 'S HISTORY
ShimonSchocken_2010X YOUNG
ShimonSchocken_2010X YOU CAN SEE FELLOW RIDERS AT THE END OF THE PICTURE
ShimonSchocken_2010X LOOKING AT ME WITH SOME CONCERN AND HERE IS ANOTHER PICTURE OF THEM UNFORTUNATELY I CANNOT SHOW THEIR FACES NEITHER CAN I
ShimonSchocken_2010X SPENDING TIME IN A CORRECTION FACILITY
ShimonSchocken_2010X ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES
ShimonSchocken_2010X THESE KIDS ONCE A WEEK EVERY TUESDAY RAIN OR SHINE
ShimonSchocken_2010X FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND BY NOW THEY'VE BECOME A VERY BIG PART OF MY LIFE THIS STORY BEGAN FOUR YEARS AGO
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND IT'S SURROUNDED BY
ShimonSchocken_2010X SO ON ONE OF THESE RIDES I TALKED MY WAY
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND WENT TO SEE THE
ShimonSchocken_2010X I TOLD THE WARDEN THAT I WANTED TO START A MOUNTAIN
ShimonSchocken_2010X A CORRECTION FACILITY THESE
ShimonSchocken_2010X WE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT IT AND
ShimonSchocken_2010X SEE MYSELF GOING INTO A STATE
ShimonSchocken_2010X THIS BEING ISRAEL THE WARDEN SOMEHOW
ShimonSchocken_2010X OF
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND MY PARTNER IN THIS PROJECT
ShimonSchocken_2010X THE WORLD OF TOTAL FREEDOM
ShimonSchocken_2010X THESE EVERYTHING YOU SEE HERE IS OBVIOUSLY IN ISRAEL AS WELL AS CLOSE ENCOUNTERS WITH ALL SORTS OF SMALL CREATURES
ShimonSchocken_2010X ALL THIS SPLENDOR THE BEGINNING
ShimonSchocken_2010X SMALL OBSTACLE EVERY
ShimonSchocken_2010X SO WE HAD A LOT OF THIS GOING ON I FOUND OUT THAT THEY HAD A VERY HARD TIME DEALING WITH FRUSTRATION
ShimonSchocken_2010X NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE PHYSICALLY UNFIT BUT THAT'S ONE REASON WHY
ShimonSchocken_2010X NOT ONLY TO BE WITH
ShimonSchocken_2010X A
ShimonSchocken_2010X SOME ROCKY TERRAIN
ShimonSchocken_2010X GETS CAUGHT IN ONE OF THESE
ShimonSchocken_2010X SO HE CRASHES DOWN AND HE GETS SLIGHTLY INJURED
ShimonSchocken_2010X UP AND THEN STARTING TO JUMP UP AND DOWN
ShimonSchocken_2010X IN THE AIR
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND NOTHING IN MY BACKGROUND PREPARED ME TO
ShimonSchocken_2010X HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THESE INCIDENTS DID NOT HAPPEN IN
ShimonSchocken_2010X AWAY FROM THE NEAREST ROAD
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND WHAT YOU DON'T SEE IN THIS PICTURE IS THAT
ShimonSchocken_2010X BETWEEN THESE
ShimonSchocken_2010X WELL THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER YOU HAVE TO GET THIS GUY MOVING BECAUSE IT'S GETTING DARK SOON AND DANGEROUS
ShimonSchocken_2010X TOOK ME SEVERAL SUCH INCIDENTS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO
ShimonSchocken_2010X HARSH WORDS AND THREATS AND THEY TOOK ME NOWHERE
ShimonSchocken_2010X I FOUND OUT
ShimonSchocken_2010X CAN POSSIBLY
ShimonSchocken_2010X REALLY WANT TO DO IS GO AWAY BUT THAT'S WHAT HE HAD ALL HIS LIFE PEOPLE WALKING AWAY FROM HIM SO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND
ShimonSchocken_2010X REST FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN WE'LL GO ON
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND I
ShimonSchocken_2010X HE SPENT THE LAST TEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE IN TWO PLACES ONLY
ShimonSchocken_2010X THE STATE PRISON WHERE HE SPEND THE LAST TWO YEARS BEFORE
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND SO
ShimonSchocken_2010X WAS PROBABLY
ShimonSchocken_2010X ALMOST EVERY ADULT ALONG THE WAY
ShimonSchocken_2010X WHEN AN ADULT THAT HE LEARNS TO RESPECT STAYS
ShimonSchocken_2010X A FEW WORDS ABOUT VISION WHEN I STARTED THIS PROGRAM FOUR YEARS AGO I HAD THIS ORIGINAL PLAN
ShimonSchocken_2010X WAS ANOTHER VISION SUPREMELY
ShimonSchocken_2010X MORE IMPORTANT AND MORE READILY AVAILABLE
ShimonSchocken_2010X ON ME IN THIS PROJECT THAT THE PURPOSE OF THESE RIDES SHOULD ACTUALLY BE TO EXPOSE THE KIDS TO ONE THING ONLY
ShimonSchocken_2010X LOVE AND RESPECT TO OTHER FELLOW MEMBERS IN YOUR TEAM
ShimonSchocken_2010X MOST IMPORTANTLY LOVE AND RESPECT TO YOURSELF
ShimonSchocken_2010X KIDS I ALSO WENT THROUGH A REMARKABLE TRANSFORMATION NOW I COME FROM A CUTTHROAT WORLD OF SCIENCE AND
ShimonSchocken_2010X WITH MYSELF WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PERFECT
ShimonSchocken_2010X SO RIGHT NOW I FEEL MORE
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND ONE OF THESE PRINCIPLES IS FOCUS BEFORE
ShimonSchocken_2010X DURING THE RIDE YOU HAVE TO FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON SOMETHING BECAUSE
ShimonSchocken_2010X IS
ShimonSchocken_2010X IMPORTANT LIFE COPING STRATEGIES
ShimonSchocken_2010X CAN REALLY
ShimonSchocken_2010X SOME
ShimonSchocken_2010X CANNOT TAKE IT ANYMORE
ShimonSchocken_2010X IGNORE THE IMMEDIATE OBSTACLES AND
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND LOOK AROUND AND SEE HOW
ShimonSchocken_2010X UPWARDS THAT'S WHAT PERSPECTIVE IS ALL ABOUT
ShimonSchocken_2010X TIME AND
ShimonSchocken_2010X YOU'VE ALREADY CONQUERED STEEPER MOUNTAINS BEFORE
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND THAT'S HOW THEY DEVELOP SELF ESTEEM
ShimonSchocken_2010X AT THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY IT'S VERY COLD AND YOU'RE STANDING IN ONE OF THESE RAINY DAYS AND IT'S DRIZZLING AND
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND YOU LOOK UP AT THE SKY AND THROUGH THE CLOUDS YOU SEE THE MONASTERY AT THE TOP OF THE
ShimonSchocken_2010X YOU SAY HEY ALEX LOOK AT THIS PARKING LOT WHERE WE STARTED IT'S THAT
ShimonSchocken_2010X WE TALKED ABOUT THESE SPECIAL WORDS THAT WE TEACH THEM AND AT THE END OF
ShimonSchocken_2010X SHARE MOMENTS IN WHICH THOSE SPECIAL WORDS OF THE
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND MADE A DIFFERENCE
ShimonSchocken_2010X THESE DISCUSSIONS CAN BE EXTREMELY INSPIRING IN ONE OF THEM ONE OF THE KIDS ONCE SAID
ShimonSchocken_2010X WHEN WE WERE RIDING ON
ShimonSchocken_2010X VILLAGE IN ETHIOPIA AND WENT AWAY TOGETHER WITH MY BROTHER
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND HE GOES ON SAYING AND EVERYONE LOOKS AT HIM LIKE A HERO PROBABLY FOR THE FIRST TIME
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND HE SAYS BECAUSE I ALSO HAVE VOLUNTEERS RIDING WITH ME ADULTS
ShimonSchocken_2010X HE SAYS AND THIS WAS JUST THE BEGINNING OF
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND ONLY NOW HE SAYS I'M BEGINNING TO
ShimonSchocken_2010X THE MOAB MOUNTAINS HERE IN THE BACKGROUND THAT'S WHERE JOSHUA DESCENDED
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND SO
ShimonSchocken_2010X PLAY KEY ROLES IN THE WAY I PLAN MY
ShimonSchocken_2010X THAT WERE ESTABLISHED BY HOLOCAUST
ShimonSchocken_2010X WE EXPLORE
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND WE DISCUSS
ShimonSchocken_2010X FIVE
ShimonSchocken_2010X AND THROUGH THIS TAPESTRY WHICH IS THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY
ShimonSchocken_2010X WHAT IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT VALUE IN EDUCATION
ShimonSchocken_2010X PICTURE I TOOK LAST TUESDAY
