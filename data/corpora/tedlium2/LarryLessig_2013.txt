LarryLessig_2013@16:18.22 THERE WAS A PLACE CALLED LESTERLAND
LarryLessig_2013@18.71:22.49 NOW LESTERLAND LOOKS A LOT LIKE THE UNITED STATES
LarryLessig_2013@22.49:40.38 LIKE THE UNITED STATES IT HAS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE AND OF THAT THREE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE IT TURNS OUT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND ARE CALLED LESTER IF MATT 'S IN THE AUDIENCE I JUST BORROWED THAT I 'LL RETURN IT IN A SECOND THIS CHARACTER FROM YOUR SERIES
LarryLessig_2013@40.38:49.19 SO ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND ARE CALLED LESTER WHICH MEANS ABOUT FIVE PERCENT IS NAMED LESTER NOW LESTERS IN LESTERLAND
LarryLessig_2013@49.19:59.11 HAVE THIS EXTRAORDINARY POWER THERE ARE TWO ELECTIONS EVERY ELECTION CYCLE IN LESTERLAND ONE IS CALLED THE GENERAL ELECTION THE OTHER IS CALLED THE LESTER ELECTION
LarryLessig_2013@59.12:73.2 AND IN THE GENERAL ELECTION IT 'S THE CITIZENS WHO GET TO VOTE BUT IN THE LESTER ELECTION IT 'S THE LESTERS WHO GET TO VOTE AND HERE 'S THE TRICK IN ORDER TO RUN IN THE GENERAL ELECTION YOU MUST DO EXTREMELY WELL
LarryLessig_2013@73.39:81.3 IN THE LESTER ELECTION YOU DON 'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO WIN BUT YOU MUST DO EXTREMELY WELL NOW WHAT CAN WE SAY ABOUT DEMOCRACY IN LESTERLAND
LarryLessig_2013@81.3:92.71 WHAT WE CAN SAY NUMBER ONE AS THE SUPREME COURT SAID IN CITIZENS UNITED THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE ULTIMATE INFLUENCE OVER ELECTED OFFICIALS BECAUSE AFTER ALL THERE IS A GENERAL ELECTION
LarryLessig_2013@92.71:110.02 BUT ONLY AFTER THE LESTERS HAVE HAD THEIR WAY WITH THE CANDIDATES WHO WISH TO RUN IN THE GENERAL ELECTION AND NUMBER TWO OBVIOUSLY THIS DEPENDENCE UPON THE LESTERS IS GOING TO PRODUCE A SUBTLE UNDERSTATED WE COULD SAY CAMOUFLAGED BENDING TO KEEP THE LESTERS HAPPY
LarryLessig_2013@154.31:165.51 THE FUNDERS WHO GET TO VOTE AND JUST LIKE IN LESTERLAND THE TRICK IS TO RUN IN THE GENERAL ELECTION YOU MUST DO EXTREMELY WELL IN THE MONEY ELECTION YOU DON 'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO WIN THERE IS JERRY BROWN BUT YOU MUST DO
LarryLessig_2013@165.51:176.99 EXTREMELY WELL AND HERE 'S THE KEY THERE ARE JUST AS FEW RELEVANT FUNDERS IN USA LAND AS THERE ARE LESTERS IN LESTERLAND
LarryLessig_2013@182.19:200.6 WELL HERE ARE THE NUMBERS FROM TWO THOUSAND AND TEN TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF AMERICA GAVE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS OR MORE TO ANY FEDERAL CANDIDATE FIVE PERCENT GAVE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT TO ANY FEDERAL CANDIDATE ONE PERCENT THE ONE PERCENT OF THE ONE PERCENT GAVE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE TO FEDERAL CANDIDATES
LarryLessig_2013@200.6:207.47 AND IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE MY FAVORITE STATISTIC IS FORTY TWO PERCENT
LarryLessig_2013@207.47:211.64 FOR THOSE OF YOU DOING THE NUMBERS YOU KNOW THAT 'S ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO AMERICANS
LarryLessig_2013@211.64:218.18 GAVE SIXTY PERCENT OF THE SUPER PAC MONEY SPENT IN THE CYCLE WE HAVE JUST SEEN ENDING
LarryLessig_2013@218.18:230.19 SO I 'M JUST A LAWYER I LOOK AT THIS RANGE OF NUMBERS AND I SAY IT 'S FAIR FOR ME TO SAY IT 'S FIVE PERCENT WHO ARE OUR RELEVANT FUNDERS IN AMERICA IN THIS SENSE THE FUNDERS ARE OUR LESTERS
LarryLessig_2013@242.97:254.93 BUT ONLY AFTER THE FUNDERS HAVE HAD THEIR WAY WITH THE CANDIDATES WHO WISH TO RUN IN THAT GENERAL ELECTION AND NUMBER TWO OBVIOUSLY THIS DEPENDENCE UPON THE FUNDERS
LarryLessig_2013@255.1:261.55 PRODUCES A SUBTLE UNDERSTATED CAMOUFLAGED BENDING TO KEEP THE FUNDERS HAPPY
LarryLessig_2013@261.55:264.76 CANDIDATES FOR CONGRESS AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
LarryLessig_2013@264.76:272.92 SPEND BETWEEN THIRTY AND SEVENTY PERCENT OF THEIR TIME RAISING MONEY TO GET BACK TO CONGRESS OR TO GET THEIR PARTY BACK INTO POWER
LarryLessig_2013@272.92:289.86 AND THE QUESTION WE NEED TO ASK IS WHAT DOES IT DO TO THEM THESE HUMANS AS THEY SPEND THEIR TIME BEHIND THE TELEPHONE CALLING PEOPLE THEY 'VE NEVER MET BUT CALLING THE TINIEST SLICE OF THE ONE PERCENT AS ANYONE WOULD AS THEY DO THIS THEY DEVELOP A SIXTH SENSE
LarryLessig_2013@297.86:314.14 AS THEY CONSTANTLY ADJUST THEIR VIEWS IN LIGHT OF WHAT THEY KNOW WILL HELP THEM TO RAISE MONEY NOT ON ISSUES ONE TO TEN BUT ON ISSUES ELEVEN TO ONE THOUSAND LESLIE BYRNE A DEMOCRAT FROM VIRGINIA DESCRIBES THAT WHEN SHE WENT TO CONGRESS SHE WAS TOLD BY A COLLEAGUE ALWAYS LEAN TO THE GREEN
LarryLessig_2013@314.14:318.58 THEN TO CLARIFY SHE WENT ON HE WAS NOT AN ENVIRONMENTALIST
LarryLessig_2013@364.48:371.85 WHAT COULD WE DO TO MAKE LESTERLAND BETTER IT 'S AT LEAST POSSIBLE THE LESTERS WOULD ACT FOR THE GOOD OF LESTERLAND
LarryLessig_2013@372.12:375.54 BUT IN OUR LAND IN THIS LAND IN USA LAND
LarryLessig_2013@375.54:384.37 THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME SWEET LESTERS OUT THERE MANY OF THEM IN THIS ROOM HERE TODAY BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF LESTERS ACT FOR THE LESTERS
LarryLessig_2013@384.37:397.14 BECAUSE THE SHIFTING COALITIONS THAT ARE COMPRISING THE FIVE PERCENT ARE NOT COMPRISING IT FOR THE PUBLIC INTEREST IT 'S FOR THEIR PRIVATE INTEREST IN THIS SENSE THE USA IS WORSE THAN LESTERLAND AND FINALLY POINT NUMBER THREE
LarryLessig_2013@397.27:409.29 WHATEVER ONE WANTS TO SAY ABOUT LESTERLAND AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF ITS HISTORY ITS TRADITIONS IN OUR LAND IN USA LAND LESTERLAND IS A CORRUPTION A CORRUPTION
LarryLessig_2013@432.79:436.19 BUT BY A REPUBLIC THEY MEANT A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY
LarryLessig_2013@436.25:447.01 AND BY A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY THEY MEANT A GOVERNMENT AS MADISON PUT IT IN FEDERALIST FIFTY TWO THAT WOULD HAVE A BRANCH THAT WOULD BE DEPENDENT UPON THE PEOPLE ALONE
LarryLessig_2013@447.39:458.14 SO HERE 'S THE MODEL OF GOVERNMENT THEY HAVE THE PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNMENT WITH THIS EXCLUSIVE DEPENDENCY BUT THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT CONGRESS HAS EVOLVED A DIFFERENT DEPENDENCE
LarryLessig_2013@476.5:483.48 NOW THERE 'S GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS ABOUT THIS CORRUPTION ONE BIT OF GOOD NEWS IS THAT IT 'S BIPARTISAN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY CORRUPTION
LarryLessig_2013@483.48:493.52 IT BLOCKS THE LEFT ON A WHOLE RANGE OF ISSUES THAT WE ON THE LEFT REALLY CARE ABOUT IT BLOCKS THE RIGHT TOO AS IT MAKES PRINCIPLED ARGUMENTS OF THE RIGHT INCREASINGLY
LarryLessig_2013@493.52:503.53 IMPOSSIBLE SO THE RIGHT WANTS SMALLER GOVERNMENT WHEN AL GORE WAS VICE PRESIDENT HIS TEAM HAD AN IDEA FOR DEREGULATING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY
LarryLessig_2013@503.53:509.11 THE CHIEF POLICY MAN TOOK THIS IDEA TO CAPITOL HILL AND AS HE REPORTED BACK TO ME THE RESPONSE WAS
LarryLessig_2013@509.11:515.46 HELL NO IF WE DEREGULATE THESE GUYS HOW ARE WE GOING TO RAISE MONEY FROM THEM
LarryLessig_2013@515.46:529.1 THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT 'S DESIGNED TO SAVE THE STATUS QUO INCLUDING THE STATUS QUO OF BIG AND INVASIVE GOVERNMENT IT WORKS AGAINST THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT AND THAT YOU MIGHT SAY IS GOOD NEWS BUT HERE 'S THE BAD NEWS
LarryLessig_2013@529.1:533.07 IT 'S A PATHOLOGICAL DEMOCRACY DESTROYING CORRUPTION
LarryLessig_2013@533.07:541.25 BECAUSE IN ANY SYSTEM WHERE THE MEMBERS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE TINIEST FRACTION OF US FOR THEIR ELECTION THAT MEANS
LarryLessig_2013@541.25:554.09 THE TINIEST NUMBER OF US THE TINIEST TINIEST NUMBER OF US CAN BLOCK REFORM I KNOW THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE A ROCK OR SOMETHING I CAN ONLY FIND CHEESE I 'M SORRY SO THERE IT IS BLOCK REFORM
LarryLessig_2013@572.24:579.65 HENRY DAVID THOREAU THERE ARE A THOUSAND HACKING AT THE BRANCHES OF EVIL TO ONE WHO IS STRIKING AT THE ROOT
LarryLessig_2013@579.65:584.14 THIS IS THE ROOT OKAY NOW
LarryLessig_2013@595.07:598.09 YOU FOCUS ON THE POSSIBLE PROBLEMS LIKE
LarryLessig_2013@598.09:613.67 POLIO FROM THE WORLD OR TAKING AN IMAGE OF EVERY SINGLE STREET ACROSS THE GLOBE OR BUILDING THE FIRST REAL UNIVERSAL TRANSLATOR OR BUILDING A FUSION FACTORY IN YOUR GARAGE THESE ARE THE MANAGEABLE PROBLEMS SO YOU IGNORE
LarryLessig_2013@619.09:623.13 SO YOU IGNORE THIS CORRUPTION BUT WE CANNOT
LarryLessig_2013@651.48:662.62 CLIMATE CHANGE IS MINE BUT IT MIGHT BE FINANCIAL REFORM OR A SIMPLER TAX SYSTEM OR INEQUALITY GRAB THAT ISSUE SIT IT DOWN IN FRONT OF YOU LOOK STRAIGHT IN ITS EYES AND TELL IT THERE IS NO CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR
LarryLessig_2013@662.62:668.02 THERE WILL NEVER BE A CHRISTMAS WE WILL NEVER GET YOUR ISSUE SOLVED UNTIL
LarryLessig_2013@668.02:673.1 WE FIX THIS ISSUE FIRST SO IT 'S NOT THAT MINE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE IT 'S NOT
LarryLessig_2013@673.13:691.13 YOURS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT MINE IS THE FIRST ISSUE THE ISSUE WE HAVE TO SOLVE BEFORE WE GET TO FIX THE ISSUES YOU CARE ABOUT NO SENSIBLE REFORM AND WE CANNOT AFFORD A WORLD A FUTURE WITH NO SENSIBLE REFORM OKAY SO HOW DO WE DO IT
LarryLessig_2013@691.45:695.01 TURNS OUT THE ANALYTICS HERE ARE EASY SIMPLE
LarryLessig_2013@695.01:701.75 IF THE PROBLEM IS MEMBERS SPENDING AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF TIME FUNDRAISING FROM THE TINIEST SLICE OF AMERICA
LarryLessig_2013@701.75:715.68 THE SOLUTION IS TO HAVE THEM SPEND LESS TIME FUNDRAISING BUT FUNDRAISE FROM A WIDER SLICE OF AMERICANS TO SPREAD IT OUT TO SPREAD THE FUNDER INFLUENCE SO THAT WE RESTORE THE IDEA OF DEPENDENCE UPON THE PEOPLE ALONE
LarryLessig_2013@715.68:724.45 AND TO DO THIS DOES NOT REQUIRE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT CHANGING THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO DO THIS WOULD REQUIRE A SINGLE STATUTE
LarryLessig_2013@724.45:728.95 A STATUTE ESTABLISHING WHAT WE THINK OF AS SMALL DOLLAR FUNDED ELECTIONS
LarryLessig_2013@745.94:749.7 EACH OF THESE WOULD FIX THIS CORRUPTION
LarryLessig_2013@750.09:756.53 BY SPREADING OUT THE INFLUENCE OF FUNDERS TO ALL OF US THE ANALYTICS ARE EASY HERE
LarryLessig_2013@756.53:758.9 IT 'S THE POLITICS THAT 'S HARD
LarryLessig_2013@759.27:766.67 INDEED IMPOSSIBLY HARD BECAUSE THIS REFORM WOULD SHRINK K STREET
LarryLessig_2013@771.34:781.77 AS CONGRESSMAN JIM COOPER A DEMOCRAT FROM TENNESSEE PUT IT HAS BECOME A FARM LEAGUE FOR K STREET A FARM LEAGUE FOR K
LarryLessig_2013@781.77:791.24 MEMBERS AND STAFFERS AND BUREAUCRATS HAVE AN INCREASINGLY COMMON BUSINESS MODEL IN THEIR HEAD A BUSINESS MODEL FOCUSED ON THEIR LIFE AFTER GOVERNMENT THEIR LIFE AS LOBBYISTS
LarryLessig_2013@791.24:809.12 FIFTY PERCENT OF THE SENATE BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR LEFT TO BECOME LOBBYISTS FORTY TWO PERCENT OF THE HOUSE THOSE NUMBERS HAVE ONLY GONE UP AND AS UNITED REPUBLIC CALCULATED LAST APRIL THE AVERAGE INCREASE IN SALARY FOR THOSE WHO THEY TRACKED WAS ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO PERCENT
LarryLessig_2013@809.25:815.04 SO IT 'S FAIR TO ASK HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO CHANGE THIS
LarryLessig_2013@815.04:816.86 NOW
LarryLessig_2013@817.14:819.35 I GET THIS SKEPTICISM
LarryLessig_2013@819.96:821.78 I GET THIS CYNICISM
LarryLessig_2013@831.46:835.64 IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE ISSUES OUR PARENTS TRIED TO SOLVE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
LarryLessig_2013@836.04:844.79 ISSUES LIKE RACISM OR SEXISM OR THE ISSUE THAT WE 'VE BEEN FIGHTING IN THIS CENTURY HOMOPHOBIA THOSE ARE HARD ISSUES
LarryLessig_2013@844.85:854.9 YOU DON 'T WAKE UP ONE DAY NO LONGER A RACIST IT TAKES GENERATIONS TO TEAR THAT INTUITION THAT DNA OUT OF THE SOUL OF A PEOPLE
LarryLessig_2013@854.9:865.22 BUT THIS IS A PROBLEM OF JUST INCENTIVES JUST INCENTIVES CHANGE THE INCENTIVES AND THE BEHAVIOR CHANGES AND THE STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED SMALL DOLLAR FUNDED SYSTEMS HAVE SEEN OVERNIGHT
LarryLessig_2013@865.29:878.39 A CHANGE IN THE PRACTICE WHEN CONNECTICUT ADOPTED THIS SYSTEM IN THE VERY FIRST YEAR SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES GAVE UP LARGE CONTRIBUTIONS AND TOOK SMALL CONTRIBUTIONS ONLY IT 'S SOLVABLE
LarryLessig_2013@878.5:884.92 NOT BY BEING A DEMOCRAT NOT BY BEING A REPUBLICAN IT 'S SOLVABLE BY BEING
LarryLessig_2013@884.92:887.06 CITIZENS BY BEING CITIZENS
LarryLessig_2013@887.34:891.47 BY BEING TEDIZENS BECAUSE
LarryLessig_2013@891.47:893.69 IF YOU WANT TO KICKSTART REFORM
LarryLessig_2013@894.25:903.1 LOOK I COULD KICKSTART REFORM AT HALF THE PRICE OF FIXING ENERGY POLICY I COULD GIVE YOU BACK
LarryLessig_2013@903.21:907.3 A REPUBLIC OKAY BUT EVEN IF YOU 'RE NOT YET WITH ME
LarryLessig_2013@908.17:910.44 EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE
LarryLessig_2013@910.86:920.54 WHAT THE FIVE YEARS SINCE I SPOKE AT TED HAS TAUGHT ME AS I 'VE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS ISSUE AGAIN AND AGAIN IS EVEN IF YOU THINK IT 'S IMPOSSIBLE THAT IS IRRELEVANT
LarryLessig_2013@930.74:936.11 THIS IS HOPELESS HOPELESS THERE 'S NOTHING WE CAN DO
LarryLessig_2013@947.93:952.39 AND I IMAGINED A DOCTOR COMING TO ME AND SAYING YOUR SON
LarryLessig_2013@969.72:988 OF COURSE NOT I WOULD DO EVERYTHING I COULD AND I WOULD DO EVERYTHING I COULD BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT LOVE MEANS THAT THE ODDS ARE IRRELEVANT AND THAT YOU DO WHATEVER THE HELL YOU CAN THE ODDS BE DAMNED AND THEN I SAW THE OBVIOUS LINK BECAUSE EVEN WE LIBERALS LOVE THIS COUNTRY
LarryLessig_2013@1011.76:1016.46 WITH EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROVE THESE PUNDITS WRONG
LarryLessig_2013@1017.05:1018.67 SO HERE 'S MY QUESTION
LarryLessig_2013@1018.72:1020.82 DO YOU HAVE THAT LOVE DO YOU
LarryLessig_2013@1033.91:1038.49 WHEN BEN FRANKLIN WAS CARRIED FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION
LarryLessig_2013@1038.6:1043.8 IN SEPTEMBER OF ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN HE WAS STOPPED IN THE STREET BY A WOMAN WHO SAID MR FRANKLIN
LarryLessig_2013@1049.79:1052.14 IF YOU CAN KEEP IT
LarryLessig_2013@1053.89:1058.39 A REPUBLIC A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY
LarryLessig_2013@1058.71:1063.51 A GOVERNMENT DEPENDENT UPON THE PEOPLE ALONE
LarryLessig_2013@1065.2:1066.8 WE HAVE
LarryLessig_2013@1067.08:1069.02 LOST THAT REPUBLIC
LarryLessig_2013@1070.52:1075.96 ALL OF US HAVE TO ACT TO GET IT BACK THANK YOU VERY MUCH
