DanielGoleman_2007 YOU KNOW I'M STRUCK BY HOW ONE OF THE IMPLICIT THEMES OF TED IS COMPASSION THESE VERY MOVING DEMONSTRATIONS WE'VE JUST SEEN HIV IN AFRICA
DanielGoleman_2007 PRESIDENT CLINTON LAST NIGHT AND I'D LIKE TO DO A LITTLE
DanielGoleman_2007 IF YOU WILL ABOUT COMPASSION
DanielGoleman_2007 AND BRING IT FROM THE
DanielGoleman_2007 GLOBAL LEVEL TO THE PERSONAL I'M A PSYCHOLOGIST BUT REST ASSURED I WILL NOT BRING IT TO THE SCROTAL
DanielGoleman_2007 DIVINITY STUDENTS AT THE PRINCETON THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY
DanielGoleman_2007 TOLD THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GIVE A PRACTICE SERMON AND THEY WERE EACH GIVEN A SERMON TOPIC HALF OF THOSE STUDENTS WERE GIVEN AS A TOPIC THE PARABLE OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN THE MAN WHO STOPPED THE STRANGER IN
DanielGoleman_2007 TO HELP THE STRANGER IN NEED BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD HALF WERE GIVEN RANDOM BIBLE TOPICS THEN ONE BY ONE THEY WERE TOLD THEY HAD TO GO TO ANOTHER BUILDING
DanielGoleman_2007 AS THEY WENT FROM THE FIRST BUILDING TO THE SECOND EACH OF THEM PASSED A MAN WHO WAS BENT OVER AND MOANING CLEARLY IN
DanielGoleman_2007 MORE INTERESTING QUESTION IS
DanielGoleman_2007 DID IT MATTER THEY WERE CONTEMPLATING THE PARABLE OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN
DanielGoleman_2007 WHAT TURNED OUT TO DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEONE WOULD STOP AND HELP A STRANGER IN NEED WAS HOW MUCH OF A HURRY
DanielGoleman_2007 THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE IN WERE THEY FEELING THEY WERE LATE
DanielGoleman_2007 OR WERE THEY ABSORBED
DanielGoleman_2007 IN WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT AND THIS IS I THINK THE PREDICAMENT OF OUR LIVES
DanielGoleman_2007 THAT WE DON'T TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO HELP BECAUSE OUR FOCUS IS IN THE WRONG DIRECTION THERE'S A NEW FIELD IN BRAIN SCIENCE SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE
DanielGoleman_2007 FROM SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE IS THAT OUR DEFAULT WIRING
DanielGoleman_2007 IS TO HELP THAT IS TO SAY
DanielGoleman_2007 IF WE ATTEND TO THE OTHER PERSON WE AUTOMATICALLY EMPATHIZE WE AUTOMATICALLY FEEL WITH
DanielGoleman_2007 THESE NEWLY IDENTIFIED NEURONS MIRROR NEURONS THAT ACT LIKE A NEURO WI FI ACTIVATING IN OUR BRAIN EXACTLY THE AREAS ACTIVATED IN THEIRS WE FEEL WITH AUTOMATICALLY
DanielGoleman_2007 AND IF THAT PERSON IS IN NEED IF THAT PERSON IS SUFFERING WE'RE AUTOMATICALLY PREPARED TO HELP AT LEAST THAT'S THE ARGUMENT BUT THEN THE QUESTION IS
DanielGoleman_2007 WHY DON'T WE AND I THINK THIS SPEAKS TO A SPECTRUM THAT GOES FROM COMPLETE SELF ABSORPTION
DanielGoleman_2007 TO NOTICING TO EMPATHY AND TO
DanielGoleman_2007 THE SIMPLE FACT IS IF WE ARE FOCUSED ON OURSELVES IF WE'RE PREOCCUPIED AS WE SO OFTEN ARE THROUGHOUT THE DAY
DanielGoleman_2007 WE DON'T REALLY FULLY NOTICE THE OTHER AND THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SELF AND THE OTHER FOCUS CAN BE VERY SUBTLE I WAS DOING MY
DanielGoleman_2007 TAXES THE OTHER DAY AND I GOT TO THE POINT WHERE I WAS LISTING ALL OF THE DONATIONS I GAVE AND I HAD AN EPIPHANY IT WAS
DanielGoleman_2007 I CAME TO MY CHECK TO THE SEVA FOUNDATION AND I NOTICED THAT I THOUGHT BOY MY FRIEND LARRY BRILLIANT WOULD REALLY BE HAPPY THAT I GAVE MONEY TO SEVA THEN I REALIZED THAT WHAT I WAS GETTING FROM GIVING WAS A NARCISSISTIC HIT
DanielGoleman_2007 THAT I FELT GOOD ABOUT MYSELF THEN I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT
DanielGoleman_2007 THE PEOPLE IN THE HIMALAYAS WHOSE CATARACTS WOULD BE HELPED AND I REALIZED THAT I WENT FROM THIS KIND OF NARCISSISTIC SELF FOCUS TO ALTRUISTIC JOY
DanielGoleman_2007 TO FEELING GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WERE BEING HELPED
DanielGoleman_2007 I THINK THAT'S A MOTIVATOR BUT THIS
DanielGoleman_2007 WHILE BACK AND I OVERHEARD TWO WOMEN TALKING ABOUT THE BROTHER OF ONE WOMAN WHO WAS IN THE SINGLES SCENE
DanielGoleman_2007 AND THIS WOMAN SAYS MY BROTHER IS HAVING TROUBLE GETTING DATES SO HE 'S TRYING SPEED DATING I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW SPEED DATING WOMEN SIT AT TABLES
DanielGoleman_2007 AND MEN GO FROM TABLE TO TABLE AND THERE'S A CLOCK AND A BELL AND AT FIVE MINUTES BINGO
DanielGoleman_2007 THE CONVERSATION ENDS AND THE WOMAN CAN DECIDE WHETHER TO GIVE HER CARD
DanielGoleman_2007 OR HER EMAIL ADDRESS TO THE MAN FOR FOLLOW UP AND THIS WOMAN SAYS MY BROTHER 'S NEVER GOTTEN A CARD AND I KNOW EXACTLY WHY
DanielGoleman_2007 THE MOMENT HE SITS DOWN HE STARTS TALKING NON STOP ABOUT HIMSELF HE NEVER ASKS ABOUT THE WOMAN AND I WAS DOING SOME
DanielGoleman_2007 RESEARCH IN THE
DanielGoleman_2007 THE TEST WAS FROM THE MOMENT THEY GOT TOGETHER HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE THE GUY TO ASK HER A QUESTION WITH THE WORD YOU IN IT AND APPARENTLY EPSTEIN ACED THE TEST THEREFORE THE
DanielGoleman_2007 THIS IS A IT'S A LITTLE TEST I ENCOURAGE YOU TO TRY OUT AT A PARTY HERE AT TED THERE ARE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES
DanielGoleman_2007 THE HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW RECENTLY HAD AN ARTICLE CALLED THE HUMAN MOMENT ABOUT HOW TO MAKE REAL CONTACT WITH A PERSON AT WORK AND THEY SAID WELL THE FUNDAMENTAL THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS TURN OFF YOUR BLACKBERRY CLOSE YOUR LAPTOP
DanielGoleman_2007 YOUR DAYDREAM AND PAY FULL ATTENTION TO THE PERSON
DanielGoleman_2007 THERE IS A NEWLY COINED WORD IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
DanielGoleman_2007 FOR THE MOMENT WHEN THE PERSON WE'RE WITH WHIPS OUT THEIR BLACKBERRY OR ANSWERS THAT CELL PHONE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE DON'T EXIST
DanielGoleman_2007 THE WORD IS PIZZLED IT'S A COMBINATION OF PUZZLED AND PISSED OFF
DanielGoleman_2007 MY BROTHER IN LAW LEONARD DECIDED TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT A SERIAL KILLER THIS IS A MAN WHO TERRORIZED THE VERY VICINITY WE'RE IN MANY YEARS AGO HE WAS KNOWN AS THE SANTA CRUZ STRANGLER AND BEFORE HE WAS ARRESTED HE HAD MURDERED
DanielGoleman_2007 HIS GRANDPARENTS HIS MOTHER AND FIVE CO EDS AT UC SANTA CRUZ SO MY BROTHER IN LAW GOES TO INTERVIEW THIS KILLER
DanielGoleman_2007 AND HE REALIZES WHEN HE MEETS HIM THAT THIS GUY IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING FOR ONE THING HE 'S ALMOST SEVEN FEET TALL
DanielGoleman_2007 BUT THAT'S NOT THE MOST TERRIFYING THING ABOUT HIM THE SCARIEST THING IS THAT HIS IQ IS ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY A CERTIFIED GENIUS
DanielGoleman_2007 BUT THERE IS ZERO CORRELATION BETWEEN IQ AND EMOTIONAL EMPATHY FEELING WITH THE OTHER PERSON THEY'RE CONTROLLED BY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BRAIN
DanielGoleman_2007 ONE POINT MY BROTHER IN LAW GETS UP THE COURAGE TO ASK THE ONE QUESTION HE REALLY WANTS TO KNOW THE ANSWER TO AND THAT IS
DanielGoleman_2007 HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE IT
DanielGoleman_2007 PITY FOR YOUR VICTIMS THESE WERE VERY INTIMATE MURDERS HE STRANGLED HIS VICTIMS
DanielGoleman_2007 IF I'D FELT THE DISTRESS I COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT
DanielGoleman_2007 TO TURN THAT PART OF ME OFF
DanielGoleman_2007 HAD TO TURN THAT PART OF ME OFF AND I THINK THAT
DanielGoleman_2007 THAT IS VERY TROUBLING
DanielGoleman_2007 AND IN A SENSE
DanielGoleman_2007 RIGHT NOW AS BILL MCDONOUGH HAS POINTED OUT
DanielGoleman_2007 THE OBJECTS THAT WE BUY AND USE HAVE HIDDEN CONSEQUENCES WE'RE ALL UNWITTING VICTIMS OF A COLLECTIVE BLIND SPOT WE DON'T NOTICE AND DON'T NOTICE THAT WE DON'T NOTICE THE TOXIC MOLECULES
DanielGoleman_2007 EMITTED BY A CARPET OR BY THE FABRIC ON THE SEATS OR WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT FABRIC
DanielGoleman_2007 TECHNOLOGICAL OR
DanielGoleman_2007 MANUFACTURING NUTRIENT IT CAN BE REUSED OR DOES IT JUST END UP AT LANDFILL IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE OBLIVIOUS TO THE
DanielGoleman_2007 ECOLOGICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE CONSEQUENCES OF THE THINGS WE BUY AND USE
DanielGoleman_2007 ROOM ITSELF IS THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM BUT WE DON'T SEE IT AND WE'VE
DanielGoleman_2007 BECOME VICTIMS OF A SYSTEM THAT POINTS US ELSEWHERE
DanielGoleman_2007 CONSIDER THIS THERE'S A
DanielGoleman_2007 WONDERFUL BOOK CALLED STUFF THE HIDDEN LIFE
DanielGoleman_2007 OF EVERYDAY OBJECTS
DanielGoleman_2007 AND IT TALKS ABOUT THE BACK STORY OF SOMETHING LIKE A T SHIRT AND IT TALKS ABOUT WHERE THE COTTON WAS GROWN AND THE FERTILIZERS THAT WERE USED AND THE CONSEQUENCES FOR SOIL OF THAT FERTILIZER
DanielGoleman_2007 AND IT MENTIONS FOR INSTANCE THAT COTTON IS VERY RESISTANT TO TEXTILE DYE ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT WASHES OFF INTO WASTEWATER AND IT'S WELL KNOWN BY EPIDEMIOLOGISTS THAT KIDS WHO LIVE NEAR TEXTILE WORKS
DanielGoleman_2007 TEND TO HAVE HIGH RATES OF LEUKEMIA
DanielGoleman_2007 THERE'S A COMPANY BENNETT AND COMPANY THAT SUPPLIES POLO COM
DanielGoleman_2007 THEY BECAUSE OF THEIR CEO WHO 'S AWARE OF THIS IN CHINA FORMED A JOINT VENTURE
DanielGoleman_2007 WITH THEIR DYE WORKS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WASTEWATER WOULD BE PROPERLY TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE IT RETURNED TO THE
DanielGoleman_2007 RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE THE OPTION TO CHOOSE THE VIRTUOUS T SHIRT OVER THE NON VIRTUOUS ONE
DanielGoleman_2007 SO WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO DO THAT
DanielGoleman_2007 WELL I'VE BEEN THINKING
DanielGoleman_2007 FOR ONE THING THERE'S A NEW ELECTRONIC TAGGING
DanielGoleman_2007 CAN TRACK IT BACK TO THE FACTORY ONCE YOU CAN TRACK IT BACK TO THE FACTORY YOU CAN LOOK AT THE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES THAT WERE USED TO MAKE IT AND
DanielGoleman_2007 IF IT'S VIRTUOUS YOU CAN LABEL IT THAT WAY
DanielGoleman_2007 OR IF IT'S NOT SO VIRTUOUS YOU CAN GO INTO TODAY GO INTO
DanielGoleman_2007 ANY STORE PUT YOUR SCANNER ON A PALM ONTO A BARCODE WHICH WILL TAKE YOU TO A WEBSITE THEY HAVE IT FOR PEOPLE WITH
DanielGoleman_2007 IN THE WORLD OF
DanielGoleman_2007 THE QUESTION IS WILL IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE
DanielGoleman_2007 I DID AN ARTICLE ON WHAT WAS THEN A NEW PROBLEM IN NEW YORK IT WAS HOMELESS PEOPLE ON THE STREETS
DanielGoleman_2007 AND I SPENT A COUPLE OF WEEKS GOING AROUND WITH A SOCIAL WORK AGENCY THAT MINISTERED TO THE HOMELESS AND I REALIZED SEEING THE HOMELESS THROUGH THEIR EYES
DanielGoleman_2007 THAT ALMOST ALL OF THEM WERE PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS THAT HAD NOWHERE TO GO THEY HAD A DIAGNOSIS IT MADE ME WHAT IT DID WAS TO SHAKE ME OUT OF THE URBAN TRANCE WHERE
DanielGoleman_2007 WHEN WE SEE WHEN WE'RE PASSING SOMEONE WHO 'S HOMELESS IN THE PERIPHERY OF OUR VISION IT STAYS ON THE PERIPHERY
DanielGoleman_2007 WE DON'T NOTICE AND THEREFORE WE
DanielGoleman_2007 ONE DAY SOON AFTER THAT IT WAS A FRIDAY
DanielGoleman_2007 AT THE END OF THE DAY I WENT DOWN I WAS GOING DOWN TO THE SUBWAY IT WAS RUSH HOUR AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE STREAMING DOWN THE STAIRS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN AS I WAS GOING DOWN THE STAIRS I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A MAN
DanielGoleman_2007 SLUMPED TO THE SIDE SHIRTLESS NOT MOVING
DanielGoleman_2007 AND PEOPLE WERE JUST STEPPING OVER HIM HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
DanielGoleman_2007 AND BECAUSE MY URBAN TRANCE HAD BEEN SOMEHOW WEAKENED I
DanielGoleman_2007 MYSELF STOPPING TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS WRONG THE MOMENT I STOPPED HALF A DOZEN OTHER PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY RINGED THE SAME GUY AND WE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS HISPANIC HE DIDN'T SPEAK ANY ENGLISH HE HAD NO MONEY HE'D BEEN WANDERING THE STREETS FOR DAYS
DanielGoleman_2007 AND HE 'S FAINTED FROM HUNGER IMMEDIATELY SOMEONE WENT TO GET ORANGE JUICE SOMEONE BROUGHT A HOTDOG SOMEONE BROUGHT A SUBWAY COP THIS GUY
