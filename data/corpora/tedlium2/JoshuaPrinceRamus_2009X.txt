JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@34.17:41.96 WAS TRILLED TO GET IT I WAS THRILLED TO BE THE ONLY PERSON STANDING ON THE STAGE WITH A SHINY SILVER HELMET I THOUGHT IT REPRESENTED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ARCHITECT
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@42.19:50.49 I STAYED THRILLED UNTIL I GOT HOME THREW THE HELMET ONTO MY BED FELL DOWN ONTO MY BED AND REALIZED INSIDE THERE WAS AN INSCRIPTION
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@55.72:61.59 I THINK THAT THIS IS A GREAT METAPHOR FOR THE STATE OF ARCHITECTURE AND ARCHITECTS TODAY WE ARE FOR DECORATIVE PURPOSES ONLY
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@62.90:68.20 NOW WHO DO WE HAVE TO BLAME WE CAN ONLY BLAME OURSELVES OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@68.89:75.40 THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY HAS GOTTEN MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND HAS GOTTEN MUCH MORE LITIGIOUS AND WE ARCHITECTS ARE COWARDS
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@76.18:82.75 SO AS WE HAVE FACED LIABILITY WE HAVE STEPPED BACK AND BACK AND UNFORTUNATELY WHERE THERE IS LIABILITY GUESS WHAT THERE IS
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@85.49:89.91 SO EVENTUALLY WE HAVE FOUND OURSELVES IN A TOTALLY MARGINALIZED POSITION WAY OVER HERE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@91.06:93.71 NOW WHAT DID WE DO WE'RE COWARDS BUT WE'RE SMART COWARDS
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@95.27:104.60 SO WE REDEFINED THIS MARGINALIZED POSITION AS THE PLACE OF ARCHITECTURE AND WE ANNOUNCED HEY ARCHITECTURE IT'S OVER HERE IN THIS AUTONOMOUS LANGUAGE WE'RE GOING TO SEED
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@106.85:110.66 AND WE WERE GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT WAS HORRIBLE FOR THE PROFESSION
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@111.50:116.27 WE ACTUALLY CREATED AN ARTIFICIAL SCHISM BETWEEN CREATION AND EXECUTION
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@117.24:123.17 AS IF YOU COULD ACTUALLY CREATE WITHOUT KNOWING HOW TO EXECUTE AND AS IF YOU COULD ACTUALLY EXECUTE WITHOUT KNOWING HOW TO CREATE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@124.04:132.00 NOW SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED AND THAT'S WHEN WE BEGAN TO SELL THE WORLD THAT ARCHITECTURE WAS CREATED BY INDIVIDUALS CREATING GENIUS SKETCHES
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@132.87:139.94 AND THAT THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF EFFORT TO DELIVER THOSE SKETCHES FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS IS NOT ONLY SOMETHING TO BE DERIDED
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@140.60:142.16 BUT WE WOULD MERELY WRITE IT OFF AS
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@145.46:151.54 NOW I'D ARGUE THAT THAT IS ABSURD AS STATING THAT THIRTY MINUTES OF COPULATION IS THE CREATIVE ACT
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@152.50:156.29 AND NINE MONTHS OF GESTATION AND GOD FORBID
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@156.95:158.54 TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF CHILD LABOR
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@161.68:164.24 SO WHAT DO WE ARCHITECTS NEED TO DO WE NEED TO STITCH BACK
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@173.02:179.73 WE CAN GO BACK FIFTY YEARS AND START REINJECTING AGENCY SOCIAL ENGINEERING BACK INTO ARCHITECTURE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@180.40:194.65 NOW THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE ARCHITECTS NEED TO LEARN HOW TO DO LIKE MANAGING CONTRACTS LEARNING HOW TO WRITE CONTRACTS UNDERSTANDING PROCUREMENT PROCESSES UNDERSTANDING THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND COST ESTIMATION BUT I'M GOING TO REDUCE THIS TO THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@201.81:202.43 SHOCKING
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@204.63:217.28 THE SECOND POSITION IS ACTUALLY TAKE POSITIONS TAKE JOINT POSITIONS WITH YOUR CLIENT THIS IS THE MOMENT IN WHICH YOU AS THE ARCHITECT AND YOUR CLIENT CAN BEGIN TO INJECT VISION AND AGENCY BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE TOGETHER
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@233.13:240.72 NOW I BELIEVE THAT ONE REALLY AMAZING THING WILL HAPPEN IF YOU DO THIS I'D LIKE TO CALL IT THE LOST ART OF PRODUCTIVELY LOSING CONTROL
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@241.42:250.70 YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE END RESULT IS BUT I PROMISE YOU WITH ENOUGH BRAIN POWER AND ENOUGH PASSION AND ENOUGH COMMITMENT YOU WILL ARRIVE AT CONCLUSIONS
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@266.01:276.53 THIS IS THE MODUS OPERANDI THAT WE HAVE TODAY WE ROLL ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOOT SPARTAN I E OUR VISION UP TO OUR CLIENTS GATES OF TROY
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@282.47:286.98 WELL HOW ABOUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT WE ROLL UP TO THE GATES SOMETHING THEY WANT
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@288.00:294.31 NOW THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A DANGEROUS METAPHOR BECAUSE OF COURSE WE ALL KNOW THAT INSIDE OF THE TROJAN HORSE WERE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WITH SPEARS
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@303.36:311.25 AT WHICH POINT YOU AND YOUR CLIENT HAVE THE ABILITY TO START CONSIDERING WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO PUT INSIDE THAT VESSEL THE AGENCY THE VISION
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@311.89:317.83 AND IF YOU DO THAT YOU DO THAT RESPONSIBLY I BELIEVE THAT INSTEAD OF DELIVERING SPARTANS YOU CAN DELIVER MAIDENS
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@353.19:364.69 THE FIRST ISSUE THAT WE FACED WAS THAT THE DALLAS THEATER CENTER HAD A NOTORIETY THAT WAS BEYOND WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT OF SOMEPLACE OUTSIDE OF THE TRIUMVIRATE OF NEW YORK CHICAGO AND SEATTLE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@374.94:387.31 WHY WAS THIS HORRIBLE LITTLE BUILDING SO IMPORTANT TO THEIR RENOWN AND THEIR INNOVATION BECAUSE THEY COULD DO WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO TO THIS BUILDING WHEN YOU'RE ON BROADWAY YOU CAN NOT TEAR THE PROSCENIUM DOWN
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@399.23:407.19 YOU CAN START TO GET THE BEST ARTISTIC DIRECTORS SCENIC DESIGNERS AND ACTORS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY TO COME TO PERFORM HERE BECAUSE YOU CAN DO THINGS YOU CAN'T DO ELSEWHERE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@408.04:418.74 SO THE FIRST POSITION WE TOOK WAS HEY WE AS ARCHITECTS HAD BETTER NOT SHOW UP AND DO A PRISTINE BUILDING THAT DOESN'T ENGENDER THE SAME FREEDOMS THAT THIS OLD DILAPIDATED SHED PROVIDED THE COMPANY
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@419.75:425.42 THE SECOND ISSUE IS A NUANCE OF THE FIRST AND THAT'S THAT THE COMPANY AND THE BUILDING WAS MULTIFORM
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@430.89:436.70 GO BETWEEN PROSCENIUM THRUST FLAT FLOOR ARENA TRAVERSE YOU NAME IT ALL THEY NEEDED WAS LABOR
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@446.20:453.98 SO THEY STOPPED HAVING INEXPENSIVE LABOR AND EVENTUALLY THEY HAD TO FREEZE THEIR ORGANIZATION INTO SOMETHING CALLED A BASTARDIZED THRUSCENIUM
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@454.61:464.24 SO THE SECOND POSITION WE TOOK IS THAT THE FREEDOMS THAT WE PROVIDED THE ABILITY TO MOVE BETWEEN STAGE CONFIGURATIONS HAD BETTER BE ABLE TO BE DONE WITHOUT RELYING ON OPERATIONAL COSTS
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@471.05:483.27 WAS TO TAKE ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE KNOWN AS FRONT OF HOUSE AND BACK OF HOUSE AND REDEFINE THEM AS ABOVE HOUSE AND BELOW HOUSE AT FIRST BLUSH YOU THINK HEY IT'S CRAZY WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY GAIN WE CREATED WHAT WE LIKE TO CALL SUPERFLY
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@484.81:497.86 NOW SUPERFLY THE CONCEPT IS YOU TAKE ALL THE FREEDOMS YOU NORMALLY ASSOCIATE WITH THE FLYTOWER AND YOU SMEAR THEM ACROSS FLYTOWER AND AUDITORIUM SUDDENLY THE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR CAN MOVE BETWEEN DIFFERENT STAGE AND AUDIENCE CONFIGURATIONS
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@498.19:509.64 AND BECAUSE THAT FLYTOWER HAS THE ABILITY TO PICK UP ALL THE PRISTINE ELEMENTS SUDDENLY THE REST OF THE ENVIRONMENT CAN BE PROVISIONAL AND YOU CAN DRILL CUT NAIL SCREW PAINT AND REPLACE WITH A MINIMUM OF
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@510.68:519.26 BUT THERE WAS A THIRD ADVANTAGE THAT WE GOT BY DOING THIS MOVE THAT WAS UNEXPECTED AND THAT WAS THAT IT FREED UP THE PERIMETER OF THE AUDITORIUM IN A MOST UNUSUAL WAY
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@520.40:524.53 AND THAT PROVIDED THE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR SUDDENLY THE ABILITY TO DEFINE SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@525.65:532.09 SO THE BUILDING AFFORDS ARTISTIC DIRECTORS THE FREEDOM TO CONCEIVE OF ALMOST ANY KIND OF ACTIVITY UNDERNEATH THIS FLOATING OBJECT
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@532.65:543.78 BUT ALSO TO CHALLENGE THE NOTION OF SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF SUCH THAT IN THE LAST ACT OF MACBETH IF HE OR SHE WANTS YOU TO ASSOCIATE THE PARABLE THAT YOU'RE SEEING WITH DALLAS WITH YOUR REAL LIFE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@546.62:552.90 NOW IN ORDER TO DO THIS WE AND THE CLIENTS HAD TO DO SOMETHING FAIRLY REMARKABLE IN FACT IT REALLY WAS THE CLIENTS WHO HAD TO DO IT
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@562.05:571.85 ACTUALLY THE INVERSE TWO THIRDS INFRASTRUCTURE AND ONE THIRD CAPITAL A ARCHITECTURE THAT'S A LOT FOR A CLIENT TO COMMIT TO BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY SEE THE FRUITION OF THE CONCEPT
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@572.15:580.09 BUT BASED ON THE POSITIONS THEY TOOK THE EDUCATED LEAP OF FAITH TO DO SO AND EFFECTIVELY WE CREATED WHAT WE LIKE TO CALL A THEATER MACHINE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@580.84:589.58 NOW THAT THEATER MACHINE HAS ABILITY TO MOVE BETWEEN A WHOLE SERIES OF CONFIGURATIONS AT THE PUSH OF A BUTTON AND A FEW STAGE HANDS IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@596.59:605.41 MEANING THE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO GO THROUGH OUR LOBBY ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED WHEN WE VISITED VARIOUS THEATERS IS THEY HATE US ARCHITECTS
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@605.78:612.67 BECAUSE THEY SAY THE FIRST THING THEY HAVE TO DO THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES OF ANY SHOW IS THEY HAVE TO GET OUR ARCHITECTURE OUT OF THE MIND OF THEIR PATRON
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@613.72:620.90 WELL NOW THEIR ARE POTENTIALS OF THIS BUILDING TO ALLOW THE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR TO ACTUALLY MOVE INTO THE BUILDING WITHOUT USING OUR ARCHITECTURE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@621.28:626.20 SO IN FACT THERE IS THE BUILDING THERE IS WHAT WE CALL THE DRAW YOU'RE GOING DOWN INTO OUR LOBBY
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@626.91:641.52 GO THROUGH THE LOBBY WITH OUR OWN LITTLE DANGLY BITS WHETHER YOU LIKE THEM OR NOT UP THROUGH THE STAIR THAT LEADS YOU INTO THE AUDITORIUM BUT THERE IS ALSO THE POTENTIAL TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO MOVE DIRECTLY FROM THE OUTSIDE IN THIS CASE SUGGESTING KIND OF WAGNERIAN ENTRANCE INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE AUDITORIUM
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@642.28:653.08 AND HERE IS THE FRUITION OF THAT IN ACTUALITY THESE ARE THE TWO LARGE PIVOTING DOORS THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO MOVE DIRECTLY FROM THE OUTSIDE IN OR FROM THE INSIDE OUT PERFORMERS OR AUDIENCE ALIKE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@654.57:662.67 NOW IMAGINE WHAT THAT COULD BE I HAVE TO SAY HONESTLY THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YET THE BUILDING CAN DO BECAUSE IT TAKES TOO LONG BUT IMAGINE THE FREEDOMS IF YOU COULD TAKE THIS FURTHER
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@662.93:673.58 THAT IN FACT YOU COULD CONSIDER A WAGNERIAN ENTRY A FIRST ACT IN THRUST AND INTERMISSION IN GREEK A SECOND ACT IN ARENA AND YOU LEAVE THROUGH OUR LOBBY WITH DANGLY BITS
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@674.25:682.65 NOW THAT I WOULD SAY IS ARCHITECTURE PERFORMING IT IS TAKING THE HAND OF THE ARCHITECT TO ACTUALLY REMOVE THE HAND OF THE ARCHITECT IN FAVOR OF THE HAND OF THE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@684.53:694.51 GO THROUGH THE THREE BASIC CONFIGURATIONS THIS IS THE FLAT FLOOR CONFIGURATION YOU NOTICE THAT THERE IS NO PROSCENIUM THE BALCONIES HAVE BEEN RAISED UP THERE ARE NO SEATS THE FLOOR IN THE AUDITORIUM
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@695.98:705.62 THE FIRST CONFIGURATION IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE BALCONIES COME DOWN YOU SEE THAT THE ORCHESTRA BEGINS TO HAVE A RAKE THAT'S FRONTAL TOWARDS THE END STAGE AND THE SEATS COME IN
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@706.15:713.10 THE THIRD CONFIGURATION IS A LITTLE HARDER TO UNDERSTAND HERE YOU SEE THAT THE BALCONIES ACTUALLY HAVE TO MOVE OUT OF THE WAY IN ORDER TO BRING
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@713.24:721.56 A THRUST INTO THE SPACE AND SOME OF THE SEATS NEED TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THEIR DIRECTION AND CHANGE THEIR RAKE TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN I'LL DO IT AGAIN SO YOU CAN SEE IT
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@722.08:725.52 THERE YOU SEE IT'S THE SIDE BALCONIES FOR THE PROSCENIUM
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@726.50:728.41 AND THERE IT IS IN THE THRUST CONFIGURATION
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@728.99:737.33 IN ORDER TO DO THAT AGAIN WE NEEDED A CLIENT WHO WAS WILLING TO TAKE EDUCATIONAL RISKS AND THEY TOLD US ONE IMPORTANT THING YOU SHALL NOT BETA TEST
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@738.23:746.76 MEANING NOTHING THAT WE DO CAN WE BE THE FIRST ONES TO DO IT BUT THEY WERE WILLING FOR US TO APPLY TECHNOLOGIES FROM OTHER AREAS THAT ALREADY HAD FAILSAFE MECHANISMS TO
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@748.02:757.20 AND THE SOLUTION IN TERMS OF THE BALCONIES WAS TO USE SOMETHING THAT WE ALL KNOW AS A SCOREBOARD LIFT NOW IF YOU WERE TO TAKE A SCOREBOARD AND DROP IT ON
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@760.49:766.92 IF YOU WERE NOT ABLE TO TAKE THE SCOREBOARD OUT OF THE ARENA AND BE ABLE TO DO THE ICE CAPADES THE NEXT NIGHT THAT WOULD ALSO BE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@780.28:787.02 THE SECOND TECHNOLOGY THAT WE APPLIED WAS ACTUALLY USING THINGS THAT YOU KNOW FROM THE STAGE SIDE OF AN OPERA HOUSE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@788.00:802.26 IN THIS CASE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE TAKING THE ORCHESTRA FLOOR LIFTING IT UP SPINNING IT CHANGING THE RAKE TAKING IT BACK TO FLAT FLOOR CHANGING THE RAKE AGAIN IN ESSENCE YOU CAN BEGIN TO DEFINE RAKES AND VIEWING ANGLES OF PEOPLE IN THE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@805.28:810.54 HERE YOU SEE THE CHAIRS BEING SPUN AROUND TO GO FROM PROSCENIUM OR END STAGE TO THRUST CONFIGURATION
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@811.71:824.73 THE PROSCENIUM ALSO AS FAR AS WE KNOW THIS IS THE FIRST BUILDING IN THE WORLD IN WHICH THE PROSCENIUM CAN ENTIRELY FLY OUT OF THE SPACE HERE YOU SEE THE VARIOUS ACOUSTIC BAFFLES AS WELL AS THE FLYING MECHANISMS AND CATWALKS OVER THE AUDITORIUM
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@825.39:830.85 AND ULTIMATELY UP IN THE FLYTOWER THE SCENE SETS THAT ALLOW THE TRANSFORMATIONS TO OCCUR
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@832.12:843.59 AS I SAID ALL THAT WAS IN SERVICE OF CREATING A FLEXIBLE YET AFFORDABLE CONFIGURATION BUT WE GOT THIS OTHER BENEFIT AND THAT WAS THE ABILITY OF THE PERIMETER TO SUDDENLY ENGAGE DALLAS ON THE OUTSIDE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@857.16:864.73 THAT CAN BE LIFTED SUCH THAT YOU CAN COMPLETELY DEMYSTIFY IF YOU CHOSE THE OPERATIONS OF THE THEATER GOING ON BEHIND REHEARSALS AND SO FORTH
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@864.95:873.19 BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO ALLOW THE AUDIENCE TO SEE DALLAS TO PERFORM WITH DALLAS AS THE BACKDROP OF YOUR PERFORMANCE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@874.05:880.39 NOW IF I'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH THIS IS AN EARLY CONCEPT SKETCH TAKE YOU THROUGH KIND OF A MIXTURE OF ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@890.09:896.14 BE ABLE TO EXPOSE THE AUDITORIUM TO DALLAS OR VICE VERSA DALLAS TO THE AUDITORIUM
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@896.74:905.35 BE ABLE TO OPEN PORTIONS IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE PROCESSION ALLOW PEOPLE TO COME IN AND OUT FOR AN INTERMISSION OR TO ENTER FOR THE BEGINNING OR THE END OF A PERFORMANCE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@905.78:910.64 AS I SAID ALL THE BALCONIES CAN MOVE BUT THEY CAN ALSO BE DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY THE PROSCENIUM CAN FLY
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@911.29:913.97 YOU CAN BRING LARGE OBJECTS INTO THE CHAMBER ITSELF
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@928.71:939.10 THIS BUILDING HAS THE ABILITY IN SHORT ORDER TO GO BACK TO A FLAT FLOOR ORGANIZATION SUCH THAT THEY CAN RENT IT OUT NOW IF THERE IS ANYONE HERE FROM AMERICAN AIRLINES PLEASE CONSIDER DOING YOUR CHRISTMAS PARTY HERE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@940.88:946.99 THAT ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO RAISE OPERATIONAL BUDGETS WITHOUT HAVING TO COMPETE WITH OTHER VENUES WITH MUCH LARGER AUDITORIUMS
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@947.74:949.19 THAT'S AN ENORMOUS BENEFIT
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@949.97:958.41 SO THE THEATER COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO DO TOTALLY HERMETIC LIGHT CONTROLLED SOUND CONTROLLED GREAT ACOUSTICS GREAT INTIMACY SHAKESPEARE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@959.05:962.81 CAN ALSO DO BECKET WITH THE SKYLINE OF DALLAS SITTING BEHIND IT
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@980.84:993.70 AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST YOU SEE THIS ALREADY HAS THE ABILITY TO CREATE EVENTS IN ORDER TO GENERATE OPERATIONAL BUDGETS TO OVERCOME THE BUILDING IN FACT PERFORMING TO ALLOW THE COMPANY TO OVERCOME THEIR BIGGEST PROBLEM I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A BRIEF
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@1006.74:1011.67 TRY TO DISREGARD ALL THE THOUSANDS OF ANTS RUNNING AROUND AND THINK OF IT BEING DONE WITH JUST A FEW PEOPLE
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@1042.52:1044.54 AGAIN JUST A COUPLE PEOPLE ARE REQUIRED
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@1077.26:1091.69 AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE ENTIRE AT T PERFORMING ARTS CENTER YOU CAN SEE THE WINSPEAR OPERA HOUSE ON THE RIGHT AND THE DEE AND CHARLES WYLY THEATER ON THE LEFT AND TO REMIND YOU THAT HERE IS AN EXAMPLE IN WHICH ARCHITECTURE ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X@1092.39:1101.30 BUT WE GOT TO THAT CONCLUSION WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHERE WE WERE GOING WHAT WE KNEW WERE A SERIES OF ISSUES THAT THE COMPANY AND THE CLIENT WAS CONFRONTED WITH AND WE TOOK POSITIONS WITH THEM
