DanielPauly_2010Z@82.04:86.9 SO WHAT HAPPENS HERE THE SECOND STORY
DanielPauly_2010Z@93.53:97.49 I WAS THERE IN SEVENTY ONE STUDYING A LAGOON IN WEST AFRICA
DanielPauly_2010Z@97.63:103.14 I WAS THERE BECAUSE I GREW UP IN EUROPE AND I WANTED LATER TO WORK IN AFRICA
DanielPauly_2010Z@136.56:150.85 THE FISH HAD SHRUNK TO HALF OF THEIR SIZE THEY WERE MATURING AT FIVE CENTIMETERS THEY HAD BEEN PUSHED GENETICALLY THERE WERE STILL FISHES THEY WERE STILL KIND OF HAPPY AND THE FISH ALSO WERE
DanielPauly_2010Z@156.67:164.45 MY THIRD LITTLE STORY IS THAT I WAS AN ACCOMPLICE IN THE INTRODUCTION OF TRAWLING IN SOUTHEAST ASIA

DanielPauly_2010Z@298.09:311.34 WILL USE THE IMAGES THAT THEY GOT AT THE BEGINNING OF THEIR CONSCIOUS LIVES AS A STANDARD AND WILL EXTRAPOLATE FORWARD AND THE DIFFERENCE THEN THEY PERCEIVE AS A LOSS
DanielPauly_2010Z@311.34:314.35 BUT THEY DON 'T PERCEIVE WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE
DanielPauly_2010Z@378.12:387.77 OVER TIME WE HAVE A FEW FISH LEFT AND WE THINK THIS IS THE BASELINE AND THE QUESTION IS WHY DO
DanielPauly_2010Z@429.01:432.2 SO YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE DON 'T KNOW
