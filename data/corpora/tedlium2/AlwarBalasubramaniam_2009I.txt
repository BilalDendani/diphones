AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I I SAY SCHOOL SO MANY MEMORIES COME BACK TO ME
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I SO IT WENT ON LIKE THAT AND I DIDN 'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO FIND MYSELF
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I AND ONE OF THOSE COMPETITIONS I JUST WON A SMALL LITTLE TRANSISTOR PHILIPS RADIO
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I AND I DIDN 'T HAVE THE PATIENCE TO WAIT UNTIL I REACHED HOME SO I JUST SWITCHED ON IN THE TRAIN LOUDLY IF YOU TRAVEL IN INDIAN TRAINS YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE LISTENING TO RADIO AND YOU KNOW EVEN FROM THEIR MOBILES SO AT THAT TIME AND I WAS THIRTEEN AND I WAS LISTENING TO
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I SO THAT 'S WHAT MADE ME ENTER THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AFTER THREE ATTEMPTS
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I WHEN I LOOK BACK YOU KNOW ON WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN THAT TIME AND NOW HERE THE LAST TEN FIFTEEN YEARS I CAN SEE THAT MOST OF THE WORKS REVOLVE AROUND THREE SUBJECTS
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I BUT IT WAS NOT INTENTIONAL AND I JUST START OUT WITH A TRACE BECAUSE I WAS THINKING WHAT REALLY MAKES US YOU KNOW IT 'S ACTUALLY THE PAST WHAT MAKES A PERSON
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I WORKING ABOUT TRACES I STARTED CAPTURING TRACES SO HERE ARE SOME OF THE WORKS I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU SO THIS IS CALLED SELF IN PROGRESS IT 'S JUST A TRACE OF BEING IN THIS BODY
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I SO HERE WHAT HAPPENED THEN YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY ENJOYED THE MOST IS THAT THIS SCULPTURE IS NOTHING BUT
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I SO
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I I JUST PUT THE PAPER ON THE FOCAL LENGTH WHICH WAS AN ETCHING PRINT THEN I GOT THE PORTRAIT OF THE SUN FROM SUNLIGHT
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE TRACES WHEN WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND THEM
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I THE PERCEPTION AND CONTEXT PLAY A MAJOR ROLE TO UNDERSTAND IT SO DO WE REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS OR ARE WE TRYING TO GET
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I MARTIN LUTHER KING WOULD SAY I IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE ALL COWS WILL BE FREE TO CROSS THE ROAD WITHOUT HAVING THEIR MOTIVES CALLED INTO QUESTION
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I OFTEN AND MOST OF THE TIME WE DON 'T SEE WHAT IT IS IT JUST ALL DEPENDS ON ONE 'S PERCEPTION AND CONTEXT WHAT IS REALLY CONTEXT YOU KNOW I COULD JUST SHOW YOU THIS LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER BECAUSE I ALWAYS THINK MEANING DOESN 'T REALLY EXIST
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I THIS IS THE BREADTH AND THIS IS CALLED LENGTH THIS IS HOW WE 'VE BEEN TAUGHT IN SCHOOL
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I BUT IF YOU TEAR IT IN THE MIDDLE
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I NOW I DIDN 'T TOUCH THIS BREADTH BUT STILL THE MEANING OF THIS CHANGES SO WHAT WE CONCEIVE AS A MEANING IS ALWAYS NOT THERE IT 'S ON THE OTHER SIDE
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I EVEN WHEN WE SAY DARK LIGHT GOOD BAD TALL SHORT ALL MEANING IT DOESN 'T EXIST IN REALITY IT 'S JUST THAT BEING A HUMAN THE WAY WE TRAIN TO
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I SO THE LAMP IS NOT JUST GIVING A LIGHT IT 'S ALSO GIVING A DARKNESS SO THIS IS A WORK OF ART WHICH IS JUST TRYING TO EXPLORE THAT
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I INTO VISUAL ART
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I I COULDN 'T
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I THE PROCESS TO GET TO MAKE THE SCULPTURE WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE I WROTE TO BALSARA WHO PRODUCES THAT AIR FRESHENER CALLED ODONIL SAYING DEAR SIR I AM AN ARTIST THIS IS MY CATALOGUE WILL YOU HELP ME TO MAKE THIS SCULPTURE
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I THEY NEVER WROTE BACK TO ME THEN I THOUGHT I WILL GO TO THE SMALL SCALE INDUSTRIES FACILITATING UNIT AND ASK HELP SO I TOLD THEM I 'D LIKE TO START AN AIR FRESHENER COMPANY
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I SO THIS IS AFTER A FEW WEEKS THIS IS AFTER A FEW MONTHS
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I MY MOM AND MY DAD THEY WERE LOOKING AT IT AND THEY SAID WHY DO YOU DEAL WITH NEGATIVE SUBJECTS ALL THE TIME AND I WAS LIKE WHAT DO YOU MEAN LIGHT MAKES DARK
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I SO I DID THIS WORK FOR HER IT 'S CALLED EMERGING ANGEL THIS IS THE FIRST DAY IT JUST GIVES THE APPEARANCE THAT ONE IS BECOMING THE OTHER SO THE SAME SCULPTURE AFTER A FEW DAYS
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I THIS IS AFTER FIFTEEN TWENTY DAYS
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I THROUGH THAT SMALL LITTLE SLIT BETWEEN THE GLASS BOX AND THE WOOD THE AIR GOES UNDERNEATH THE SCULPTURE AND CREATES THE OTHER ONE THIS GAVE ME A GREATER FAITH THAT EVAPORATING SCULPTURE GAVE ME A GREATER FAITH THAT MAYBE THERE IS MANY MORE POSSIBILITIES TO CAPTURE THE INVISIBLE
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I SO WHAT YOU SEE NOW IS CALLED SHADOW FORESHADOW AND WHAT I 'D LIKE TO TELL YOU
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I SO I JUST STARTED DOING THIS WORK TO INQUIRE FURTHER ABOUT HOW TO SCULPT THE SPACE BETWEEN THIS OBJECT AND THERE BECAUSE AS A VISUAL ARTIST IF I 'M SEEING THIS AND I 'M SEEING THAT BUT HOW TO SCULPT THIS
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I THEN AGAIN THAT BECOMES AN OBJECT AGAIN THROWING LIGHT THEN THE THIRD ONE SO WHAT YOU SEE IS NOTHING BUT SHADOW OF A SHADOW OF A SHADOW
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I AND THEN AGAIN AT THAT POINT THERE IS NO SHADOW I THOUGHT OH GOOD WORK IS FINISHED
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I ON THE GALLERY WALL IT 'S A FALSE WALL WHICH CONTAINS LIKE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN CUBIC FEET SO THAT HOLE ACTUALLY MAKES THE AIR COME OUT AND GO IN SO WHERE IT 'S HAPPENING WE CAN SEE BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING WILL REMAIN INVISIBLE ONLY THIS IS FROM THE SHOW CALLED INVISIBLE AT TALWAR GALLERY THIS IS CALLED KAAYAM
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I AND WHAT I 'D LIKE TO TELL YOU OUR SENSES ARE SO LIMITED WE CANNOT HEAR EVERYTHING WE CANNOT SEE EVERYTHING WE DON 'T FEEL I AM TOUCHING THE AIR BUT IF THE BREEZE IS A LITTLE MORE FASTER THEN I CAN FEEL IT SO ALL OF OUR CONSTRUCTION OF REALITY IS THROUGH THESE LIMITED SENSES SO
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I MY RECOURSE WAS LIKE IS THERE ANY WAY TO USE ALL THIS AS JUST A SYMBOL OR A SIGN
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I AND TO REALLY GET TO THE POINT WE SHOULD MOVE BEYOND YOU KNOW GO TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL LIKE IN LOGIC LIKE ARE INVISIBLE
