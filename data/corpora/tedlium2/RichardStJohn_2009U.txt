RichardStJohn_2009U@19.83:29.41 DO SO MANY PEOPLE REACH SUCCESS AND THEN FAIL ONE OF THE BIG REASONS IS WE THINK SUCCESS IS A ONE WAY STREET SO WE DO EVERYTHING THAT LEADS UP TO SUCCESS
RichardStJohn_2009U@39.13:42.08 AND I CAN TELL YOU THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TO ME
RichardStJohn_2009U@43.62:51.52 REACHING SUCCESS I WORKED HARD I PUSHED MYSELF BUT THEN I STOPPED BECAUSE I FIGURED OH YOU KNOW I MADE IT I CAN JUST SIT BACK AND RELAX
RichardStJohn_2009U@61.03:70.32 REACHING SUCCESS I WAS PRETTY GOOD AT COMING UP WITH GOOD IDEAS BECAUSE I DID ALL THESE SIMPLE THINGS THAT LED TO IDEAS BUT THEN I STOPPED BECAUSE I FIGURED I WAS THIS HOT SHOT GUY AND
RichardStJohn_2009U@70.50:77.73 I SHOULDN 'T HAVE TO WORK AT IDEAS THEY SHOULD JUST COME LIKE MAGIC AND THE ONLY THING THAT CAME WAS CREATIVE BLOCK I COULDN'T COME UP WITH ANY IDEAS
RichardStJohn_2009U@78.45:92.09 REACHING SUCCESS I ALWAYS FOCUSED ON CLIENTS AND PROJECTS AND IGNORED THE MONEY THEN ALL THIS MONEY STARTED POURING IN AND I GOT DISTRACTED BY IT AND SUDDENLY I WAS ON THE PHONE TO MY STOCKBROKER AND MY REAL ESTATE AGENT WHEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TALKING TO MY CLIENTS
RichardStJohn_2009U@92.85:104.39 REACHING SUCCESS I ALWAYS DID WHAT I LOVED BUT THEN I GOT INTO STUFF THAT I DIDN'T LOVE LIKE MANAGEMENT I AM THE WORLD 'S WORST MANAGER BUT I FIGURED I SHOULD BE DOING IT BECAUSE I WAS AFTER ALL THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY
RichardStJohn_2009U@127.33:139.42 I CAN BUY ANYTHING I WANT BUT I'M NOT HAPPY I'M DEPRESSED IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY AND I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT UNTIL IT HAPPENED TO ME BUT MONEY CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS HE SAID NO BUT IT CAN BUY PROZAC
RichardStJohn_2009U@167.58:178.81 MY PARTNER AND I THOM WE HAD TO LET ALL OUR EMPLOYEES GO IT WAS DOWN TO JUST THE TWO OF US AND WE WERE ABOUT TO GO UNDER AND THAT WAS GREAT BECAUSE WITH NO EMPLOYEES THERE WAS NOBODY FOR ME TO MANAGE
RichardStJohn_2009U@179.75:181.93 SO I WENT BACK TO DOING THE PROJECTS I LOVED
RichardStJohn_2009U@182.60:188.87 I HAD FUN AGAIN I WORKED HARDER AND TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT DID ALL THE THINGS THAT TOOK ME BACK UP TO SUCCESS
RichardStJohn_2009U@194.99:205.88 BUSINESS GREW BIGGER THAN EVER AND WHEN I WENT BACK TO FOLLOWING THESE EIGHT PRINCIPLES THE BLACK CLOUD OVER MY HEAD DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER AND I WOKE UP ONE DAY AND I SAID I DON'T NEED PROZAC ANYMORE
RichardStJohn_2009U@206.26:215.87 AND I THREW IT AWAY AND HAVEN'T NEEDED IT SINCE I LEARNED THAT SUCCESS ISN'T A ONE WAY STREET IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THIS IT REALLY LOOKS MORE LIKE THIS IT'S A CONTINUOUS JOURNEY
RichardStJohn_2009U@216.75:229.68 IF WE WANT TO AVOID SUCCESS TO FAILURE SYNDROME WE JUST KEEP FOLLOWING THESE EIGHT PRINCIPLES BECAUSE THAT IS NOT ONLY HOW WE ACHIEVE SUCCESS IT'S HOW WE SUSTAIN IT SO HERE IS TO YOUR CONTINUED SUCCESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
