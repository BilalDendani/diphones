DanielKraft_2009 I AM A PEDIATRIC CANCER DOCTOR AND STEM CELL RESEARCHER AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY WHERE MY CLINICAL FOCUS HAS BEEN BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION
DanielKraft_2009 NOW INSPIRED BY JILL BOLTE TAYLOR LAST YEAR I DIDN'T BRING A HUMAN BRAIN BUT I DID BRING A LITER OF BONE MARROW
DanielKraft_2009 SO A FEW YEARS AGO I'M DOING MY TRANSPLANT FELLOWSHIP AT STANFORD I'M IN THE OPERATING ROOM WE HAVE BOB HERE WHO IS A VOLUNTEER DONOR WE'RE SENDING HIS MARROW ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO SAVE THE LIFE OF A CHILD
DanielKraft_2009 SO ACTUALLY HOW DO WE HARVEST THIS BONE MARROW WELL WE HAVE A WHOLE O R TEAM GENERAL ANESTHESIA NURSES AND ANOTHER DOCTOR ACROSS FROM ME BOB 'S ON THE TABLE AND WE TAKE THIS SORT OF SMALL NEEDLE YOU KNOW NOT TOO BIG AND THE WAY WE DO THIS IS WE BASICALLY
DanielKraft_2009 THE SOFT TISSUE AND KIND OF PUNCH IT INTO THE HARD BONE INTO THE TUCHUS THAT'S A TECHNICAL TERM AND ASPIRATE ABOUT TEN MLS OF BONE MARROW OUT EACH TIME WITH A SYRINGE
DanielKraft_2009 AND HAND IT OFF TO THE NURSE SHE SQUIRTS IT INTO A TIN HANDS IT BACK TO ME AND WE DO THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN ABOUT
DanielKraft_2009 TWO HUNDRED TIMES USUALLY AND BY THE END OF THIS MY ARM IS SORE I'VE GOT A CALLUS ON MY HAND LET ALONE BOB WHOSE
DanielKraft_2009 SO I'M THINKING YOU KNOW THIS PROCEDURE HASN'T CHANGED IN ABOUT FORTY YEARS AND THERE IS PROBABLY A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS SO I THOUGHT OF A MINIMALLY INVASIVE APPROACH AND A NEW DEVICE THAT WE CALL THE MARROW MINER THIS IS IT
DanielKraft_2009 AND THE MARROW MINER THE WAY IT WORKS IS SHOWN HERE OUR STANDARD SEE THROUGH PATIENT INSTEAD OF ENTERING THE BONE DOZENS OF TIMES WE ENTER JUST ONCE INTO THE FRONT OF THE HIP OR THE BACK OF THE
DanielKraft_2009 AND WE HAVE A FLEXIBLE POWERED CATHETER WITH A SPECIAL WIRE LOOP TIP THAT STAYS INSIDE THE CRUNCHY PART OF THE MARROW AND FOLLOWS THE CONTOURS OF THE HIP AS IT MOVES AROUND SO IT ENABLES YOU TO VERY RAPIDLY ASPIRATE OR SUCK OUT RICH BONE MARROW VERY QUICKLY THROUGH ONE HOLE
DanielKraft_2009 WE CAN DO MULTIPLE PASSES THROUGH THAT SAME ENTRY NO ROBOTS REQUIRED AND SO VERY QUICKLY BOB CAN JUST GET ONE PUNCTURE LOCAL ANESTHESIA AND DO THIS HARVEST AS AN OUTPATIENT
DanielKraft_2009 TWO PASSES HERE IN THE SAME PATIENT FROM THE SAME HOLE THIS WAS DONE UNDER LOCAL ANESTHESIA AS AN OUTPATIENT AND WE GOT AGAIN ABOUT THREE TO SIX TIMES MORE STEM CELLS THAN THE STANDARD APPROACH DONE ON THE SAME PATIENT
DanielKraft_2009 SO WHY SHOULD YOU CARE BONE MARROW IS A VERY RICH SOURCE OF ADULT STEM CELLS YOU ALL KNOW ABOUT EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS THEY'VE GOT GREAT POTENTIAL BUT HAVEN'T YET ENTERED CLINICAL TRIALS
DanielKraft_2009 IT MAY ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO SIGN UP TO BE POTENTIAL LIVE SAVING BONE MARROW DONORS IT MAY EVEN ENABLE YOU TO BANK YOUR OWN MARROW STEM CELLS WHEN YOU'RE YOUNGER AND HEALTHIER TO USE IN THE FUTURE SHOULD YOU NEED IT
DanielKraft_2009 AND ULTIMATELY AND HERE 'S A PICTURE OF OUR BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT SURVIVORS WHO COME TOGETHER FOR A REUNION EACH YEAR AT STANFORD HOPEFULLY THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL LET US HAVE MORE OF THESE SURVIVORS IN THE FUTURE THANKS
