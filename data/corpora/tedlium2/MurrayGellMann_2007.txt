MurrayGellMann_2007@13.24:16.02 THANK YOU FOR PUTTING UP THESE PICTURES OF MY COLLEAGUES OVER HERE
MurrayGellMann_2007@19.49:27.29 TALKING ABOUT THEM NOW I'M GOING TRY AN EXPERIMENT I DON'T DO EXPERIMENTS NORMALLY I'M A THEORIST BUT I'M GOING SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF I PRESS THIS
MurrayGellMann_2007@30.68:43.04 SURE ENOUGH OK I USED TO WORK IN THIS FIELD OF ELEMENTARY PARTICLES WHAT HAPPENS TO MATTER IF YOU CHOP IT UP VERY FINE WHAT IS IT MADE OF AND THE LAWS OF THESE PARTICLES
MurrayGellMann_2007@43.78:56.43 ARE VALID THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE AND THEY'RE VERY MUCH CONNECTED WITH THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT FOUR FORCES THERE MUST BE A LOT MORE BUT THOSE ARE AT VERY VERY SMALL DISTANCES AND WE HAVEN'T REALLY INTERACTED WITH THEM VERY MUCH YET
MurrayGellMann_2007@58.03:66.85 THE MAIN THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THIS THAT WE HAVE THIS REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE IN THIS FIELD OF FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS THAT BEAUTY
MurrayGellMann_2007@67.89:73.44 IS A VERY SUCCESSFUL CRITERION FOR CHOOSING THE RIGHT THEORY AND WHY ON EARTH COULD THAT BE
MurrayGellMann_2007@76.94:79.37 WELL HERE 'S AN EXAMPLE FROM MY OWN
MurrayGellMann_2007@92.67:98.54 AND IT WAS IN DISAGREEMENT WITH SEVEN SEVEN COUNT THEM SEVEN EXPERIMENTS
MurrayGellMann_2007@99.90:106.68 EXPERIMENTS WERE ALL WRONG AND WE PUBLISHED BEFORE KNOWING THAT BECAUSE WE FIGURED IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL IT'S GOTTA BE RIGHT
MurrayGellMann_2007@107.49:117.63 THE EXPERIMENTS HAD TO BE WRONG AND THEY WERE NOW OUR FRIEND OVER THERE ALBERT EINSTEIN USED TO PAY VERY LITTLE ATTENTION WHEN PEOPLE SAID YOU KNOW
MurrayGellMann_2007@117.83:125.75 THERE'S A MAN WITH AN EXPERIMENT THAT SEEMS TO DISAGREE WITH SPECIAL RELATIVITY DC MILLER WHAT ABOUT THAT AND HE WOULD SAY
MurrayGellMann_2007@132.05:133.72 STUFF LIKE THAT WORK THAT'S THE
MurrayGellMann_2007@137.29:151.25 WHAT DO WE MEAN BY BEAUTIFUL THAT'S ONE THING I'LL TRY TO MAKE THAT CLEAR PARTIALLY CLEAR WHY SHOULD IT WORK AND IS THIS SOMETHING TO DO WITH HUMAN BEINGS I'LL LET YOU IN ON THE ANSWER TO THE LAST ONE THAT I OFFER AND THAT IS IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HUMAN
MurrayGellMann_2007@152.79:160.25 SOMEWHERE IN SOME OTHER PLANET ORBITING SOME VERY DISTANT STAR MAYBE IN A ANOTHER GALAXY THERE COULD WELL BE
MurrayGellMann_2007@174.23:175.82 THEY COULD BE OUT THERE VERY EASILY
MurrayGellMann_2007@176.94:189.82 AND SUPPOSE THEY HAVE YOU KNOW VERY DIFFERENT SENSORY APPARATUS AND SO ON THEY HAVE SEVEN TENTACLES AND THEY HAVE FOURTEEN LITTLE FUNNY LOOKING COMPOUND EYES AND A BRAIN SHAPED LIKE A PRETZEL
MurrayGellMann_2007@191.15:197.51 WOULD THEY REALLY HAVE DIFFERENT LAWS THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT AND I THINK IT IS UTTER BALONEY
MurrayGellMann_2007@198.39:205.63 I THINK THERE ARE LAWS OUT THERE AND WE OF COURSE DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM AT ANY GIVEN TIME VERY WELL
MurrayGellMann_2007@206.23:215.01 BUT WE TRY AND WE TRY TO GET CLOSER AND CLOSER AND SOMEDAY WE MAY ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIFIED THEORY OF THE PARTICLES AND FORCES
MurrayGellMann_2007@216.05:227.67 WHAT I CALL THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW WE MAY NOT EVEN BE TERRIBLY FAR FROM IT BUT EVEN IF WE DON'T RUN ACROSS IT IN OUR LIFETIMES WE CAN STILL THINK THERE IS ONE OUT THERE AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO
MurrayGellMann_2007@228.85:236.26 I THINK THAT'S THE MAIN POINT TO BE MADE WE EXPRESS THESE THINGS MATHEMATICALLY AND WHEN THE MATHEMATICS IS VERY SIMPLE
MurrayGellMann_2007@237.03:248.43 WHEN IN TERMS OF SOME MATHEMATICAL NOTATION YOU CAN WRITE THE THEORY IN A VERY BRIEF SPACE WITHOUT A LOT OF COMPLICATION THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE MEAN BY BEAUTY OR ELEGANCE
MurrayGellMann_2007@250.38:252.29 HERE 'S WHAT I WAS SAYING ABOUT THE
MurrayGellMann_2007@253.30:254.93 LAWS THEY'RE REALLY THERE
MurrayGellMann_2007@256.17:258.70 NEWTON CERTAINLY BELIEVED THAT AND
MurrayGellMann_2007@259.55:263.80 HE SAID HERE IT IS THE BUSINESS OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY TO FIND OUT THOSE LAWS
MurrayGellMann_2007@268.28:280.46 THE BASIC LAW LET 'S SAY HERE 'S AN ASSUMPTION THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE BASIC LAW REALLY TAKES THE FORM OF A UNIFIED THEORY OF ALL THE PARTICLES NOW SOME PEOPLE CALL THAT A THEORY OF EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG
MurrayGellMann_2007@281.67:291.21 BECAUSE THE THEORY IS QUANTUM MECHANICAL AND I WON 'T GO INTO A LOT OF STUFF ABOUT QUANTUM MECHANICS AND WHAT IT'S LIKE AND SO ON YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF WRONG THINGS ABOUT IT ANYWAY
MurrayGellMann_2007@293.17:294.47 THERE ARE EVEN MOVIES ABOUT IT
MurrayGellMann_2007@295.52:303.71 STUFF BUT THE MAIN THING HERE IS THAT IT PREDICTS PROBABILITIES NOW SOMETIMES THOSE PROBABILITIES ARE
MurrayGellMann_2007@305.60:314.14 AND IN A LOT OF FAMILIAR CASES THEY OF COURSE ARE BUT OTHER TIMES THEY'RE NOT AND YOU HAVE ONLY PROBABILITIES FOR DIFFERENT OUTCOMES
MurrayGellMann_2007@314.38:319.76 SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE IS NOT DETERMINED JUST BY THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW
MurrayGellMann_2007@320.09:329.54 THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW AND THIS INCREDIBLY LONG SERIES OF ACCIDENTS OR CHANCE OUTCOMES THAT ARE THERE IN ADDITION
MurrayGellMann_2007@330.59:335.14 AND THE FUNDAMENTAL THEORY DOESN'T INCLUDE THOSE CHANCE OUTCOMES THEY ARE IN ADDITION
MurrayGellMann_2007@335.93:345.59 SO IT'S NOT A THEORY OF EVERYTHING AND IN FACT A HUGE AMOUNT OF THE INFORMATION IN THE UNIVERSE AROUND US COMES FROM THOSE ACCIDENTS AND NOT JUST FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL
MurrayGellMann_2007@348.46:351.50 NOW IT'S OFTEN SAID THAT
MurrayGellMann_2007@366.14:372.80 AN ONION AND WE KEEP DOING THAT AND BUILD MORE POWERFUL MACHINES ACCELERATORS FOR PARTICLES
MurrayGellMann_2007@373.20:382.21 WE LOOK DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE STRUCTURE OF PARTICLES AND IN THAT WAY WE GET PROBABLY CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THIS FUNDAMENTAL LAW
MurrayGellMann_2007@386.64:387.84 IS THAT AS WE DO THAT
MurrayGellMann_2007@388.68:399.93 AS WE PEEL THESE SKINS OF THE ONION AND WE GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE UNDERLYING LAW WE SEE THAT EACH SKIN HAS SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH THE PREVIOUS ONE AND WITH THE NEXT ONE
MurrayGellMann_2007@401.24:407.92 WE WRITE THEM OUT MATHEMATICALLY AND WE SEE THEY USE VERY SIMILAR MATHEMATICS THEY REQUIRE VERY SIMILAR MATHEMATICS
MurrayGellMann_2007@409.14:415.84 THAT IS ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE AND THAT IS A CENTRAL FEATURE OF WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY TODAY
MurrayGellMann_2007@417.68:423.55 NEWTON CALLED IT THAT'S NEWTON BY THE WAY THAT ONE THIS ONE IS ALBERT EINSTEIN HI AL
MurrayGellMann_2007@426.52:431.88 AND ANYWAY HE SAID NATURE CONFORMABLE TO HERSELF
MurrayGellMann_2007@436.13:437.79 AND SO WHAT
MurrayGellMann_2007@438.63:449.45 THAT THE NEW PHENOMENA THE NEW SKINS THE INNER SKINS OF THE SLIGHTLY SMALLER SKINS OF THE ONION THAT WE GET TO RESEMBLE THE SLIGHTLY LARGER ONES
MurrayGellMann_2007@450.34:451.04 AND
MurrayGellMann_2007@452.24:462.93 THE KIND OF MATHEMATICS THAT WE HAD FOR THE PREVIOUS SKIN IS ALMOST THE SAME AS WHAT WE NEED FOR THE NEXT SKIN AND THAT'S WHY THE EQUATIONS LOOK SO SIMPLE
MurrayGellMann_2007@464.26:465.96 USE MATHEMATICS WE ALREADY HAVE
MurrayGellMann_2007@466.77:471.92 TRIVIAL EXAMPLE IS THIS NEWTON FOUND THE LAW OF GRAVITY
MurrayGellMann_2007@472.75:478.43 WHICH GOES LIKE ONE OVER THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE THINGS GRAVITATED COULOMB IN FRANCE
MurrayGellMann_2007@478.88:484.19 FOUND THE SAME LAW FOR ELECTRIC CHARGES HERE 'S AN EXAMPLE OF THIS SIMILARITY
MurrayGellMann_2007@485.07:489.94 YOU LOOK AT GRAVITY YOU SEE A CERTAIN LAW THEN YOU LOOK AT ELECTRICITY SURE ENOUGH THE SAME RULE
MurrayGellMann_2007@490.83:505.18 IT'S A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE THERE ARE LOTS OF MORE SOPHISTICATED EXAMPLES SYMMETRY IS VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS DISCUSSION YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS A CIRCLE FOR EXAMPLE IS SYMMETRIC UNDER ROTATIONS ABOUT THE CENTER OF THE CIRCLE
MurrayGellMann_2007@505.87:518.28 YOU ROTATE AROUND THE CENTER OF THE CIRCLE THE CIRCLE REMAINS UNCHANGED YOU TAKE A SPHERE IN THREE DIMENSIONS YOU ROTATE AROUND THE CENTER OF THE SPHERE AND ALL THOSE ROTATIONS LEAVE THE SPHERE ALONE THEY ARE SYMMETRIES OF THE SPHERE
MurrayGellMann_2007@518.63:528.28 SO WE SAY IN GENERAL THAT THERE'S A SYMMETRY UNDER CERTAIN OPERATIONS IF THOSE OPERATIONS LEAVE THE PHENOMENON OR ITS DESCRIPTION UNCHANGED
MurrayGellMann_2007@542.85:546.14 THERE'S A NEW NOTATION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THAT EXPRESSED THIS
MurrayGellMann_2007@546.67:558.39 AND IF YOU USE THAT NOTATION THE EQUATIONS GET A LOT SIMPLER THEN EINSTEIN WITH HIS SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY LOOKED AT A WHOLE SET OF SYMMETRIES OF MAXWELL 'S EQUATIONS WHICH ARE CALLED SPECIAL RELATIVITY
MurrayGellMann_2007@559.02:563.46 AND THOSE SYMMETRIES THEN MAKE THE EQUATIONS EVEN SHORTER AND EVEN PRETTIER THEREFORE
MurrayGellMann_2007@564.22:578.28 LET 'S LOOK YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THESE THINGS MEAN DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE BUT YOU CAN JUST LOOK AT THE FORM YOU CAN LOOK AT THE FORM YOU SEE ABOVE AT THE TOP A LONG LIST OF EQUATIONS WITH THREE COMPONENTS FOR THE THREE DIRECTIONS OF SPACE X Y AND Z
MurrayGellMann_2007@579.05:584.23 THEN USING VECTOR ANALYSIS YOU USE ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY AND YOU GET THIS NEXT SET
MurrayGellMann_2007@585.12:597.14 THEN YOU USE THE SYMMETRY OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND YOU GET AN EVEN SIMPLER SET DOWN HERE SHOWING THAT SYMMETRY EXHIBITS BETTER AND BETTER THE MORE AND MORE SYMMETRY YOU HAVE THE BETTER YOU EXHIBIT THE SIMPLICITY AND ELEGANCE
MurrayGellMann_2007@597.39:605.87 OF THE THEORY THE LAST TWO THE FIRST EQUATION SAYS THAT ELECTRIC CHARGES AND CURRENTS GIVE RISE TO ALL THE ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS
MurrayGellMann_2007@606.76:621.11 THE NEXT SECOND EQUATION SAYS THAT THERE IS NO MAGNETISM OTHER THAN THAT THE ONLY MAGNETISM COMES FROM ELECTRIC CHARGES AND CURRENTS SOMEDAY WE MAY FIND SOME SLIGHT HOLE IN THAT ARGUMENT BUT FOR THE MOMENT THAT'S THE CASE
MurrayGellMann_2007@623.88:634.51 NOW HERE IS A VERY EXCITING DEVELOPMENT THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE NOT HEARD OF THEY SHOULD HAVE HEARD OF IT BUT IT'S A LITTLE TRICKY TO EXPLAIN IN TECHNICAL DETAIL SO I WON 'T DO IT I'LL JUST MENTION
MurrayGellMann_2007@639.97:642.82 CALLED BY US FRANK YANG AND
MurrayGellMann_2007@645.72:658.58 BOB MILLS PUT FORWARD FIFTY YEARS AGO THIS GENERALIZATION OF MAXWELL 'S EQUATIONS WITH A NEW SYMMETRY A WHOLE NEW SYMMETRY MATHEMATICS VERY SIMILAR BUT THERE WAS A WHOLE NEW SYMMETRY
MurrayGellMann_2007@660.05:662.97 THEY HOPED THAT THIS WOULD CONTRIBUTE SOMEHOW TO PARTICLE PHYSICS
MurrayGellMann_2007@664.97:677.60 IT DIDN 'T BY ITSELF CONTRIBUTE TO PARTICLE PHYSICS BUT THEN SOME OF US GENERALIZED IT FURTHER AND THEN IT DID AND IT GAVE A VERY BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTION OF THE STRONG FORCE AND OF THE WEAK FORCE
MurrayGellMann_2007@678.82:689.03 SO HERE WE SAY AGAIN WHAT WE SAID BEFORE THAT EACH SKIN OF THE ONION SHOWS A SIMILARITY TO THE ADJOINING SKINS SO THE MATHEMATICS FOR THE ADJOINING SKINS IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE NEED FOR THE
MurrayGellMann_2007@690.55:691.94 AND THEREFORE IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL
MurrayGellMann_2007@696.85:701.28 SO HERE ARE THE THEMES WE BELIEVE THERE IS A UNIFIED THEORY UNDERLYING
MurrayGellMann_2007@704.90:710.60 STEPS TOWARD UNIFICATION EXHIBIT THE SIMPLICITY SYMMETRY EXHIBITS THE SIMPLICITY
MurrayGellMann_2007@710.92:719.13 AND THEN THERE IS SELF SIMILARITY ACROSS THE SCALES IN OTHER WORDS FROM ONE SKIN OF THE ONION TO ANOTHER ONE PROXIMATE SELF SIMILARITY
MurrayGellMann_2007@719.43:727.29 AND THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THIS PHENOMENON THAT WILL ACCOUNT FOR WHY BEAUTY IS A SUCCESSFUL CRITERION FOR SELECTING THE RIGHT THEORY
MurrayGellMann_2007@728.24:732.91 HERE 'S WHAT NEWTON HIMSELF SAID NATURE IS VERY CONSONANT AND CONFORMABLE TO
MurrayGellMann_2007@734.11:739.80 ONE THING HE WAS THINKING OF IS SOMETHING THAT MOST OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED TODAY BUT IN HIS DAY IT WASN'T TAKEN FOR GRANTED
MurrayGellMann_2007@740.68:743.35 THE STORY WHICH IS NOT ABSOLUTELY
MurrayGellMann_2007@744.34:752.11 CERTAIN TO BE RIGHT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE TOLD IT FOUR SOURCES TOLD IT THAT WHEN THEY HAD THE PLAGUE IN CAMBRIDGE AND HE WENT DOWN TO HIS MOTHER 'S FARM
MurrayGellMann_2007@761.69:767.28 THAT DREW THE APPLE DOWN TO THE EARTH COULD BE THE SAME AS THE FORCE REGULATING THE MOTIONS OF THE PLANETS AND THE MOON
MurrayGellMann_2007@773.35:774.84 THE SAME THEORY OF GRAVITY
MurrayGellMann_2007@784.31:793.21 THIS PRINCIPLE OF NATURE BEING VERY REMOTE FROM THE CONCEPTIONS OF PHILOSOPHERS I FORBORE TO DESCRIBE IT IN THAT BOOK LEAST I SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED AN EXTRAVAGANT FREAK
MurrayGellMann_2007@800.35:809.02 AND SO PREJUDICE MY READERS AGAINST ALL THOSE THINGS WHICH WERE THE MAIN DESIGN OF THE BOOK NOW WHO TODAY WOULD CLAIM THAT AS A MERE CONCEIT OF THE HUMAN MIND
MurrayGellMann_2007@809.74:820.11 THAT THE FORCE THAT CAUSES THE APPLE TO FALL TO THE GROUND IS THE SAME FORCE THAT CAUSES THE PLANETS AND THE MOON TO MOVE AROUND AND SO ON EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT IT'S A PROPERTY OF GRAVITATION
MurrayGellMann_2007@820.61:833.53 NOT SOMETHING IN THE HUMAN MIND THE HUMAN MIND CAN OF COURSE APPRECIATE IT AND ENJOY IT USE IT BUT IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T STEM FROM THE HUMAN MIND IT STEMS FROM THE CHARACTER OF GRAVITY AND THAT'S TRUE OF ALL THE THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
MurrayGellMann_2007@833.79:844.65 THEY ARE PROPERTIES OF THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW IS SUCH THAT THE DIFFERENT SKINS OF THE ONION RESEMBLE ONE ANOTHER AND THEREFORE THE MATH FOR ONE SKIN ALLOWS YOU TO EXPRESS
MurrayGellMann_2007@845.24:848.30 SIMPLY THE PHENOMENON OF THE NEXT SKIN
MurrayGellMann_2007@849.02:851.50 I SAY HERE THAT NEWTON DID A LOT OF THINGS THAT YEAR
MurrayGellMann_2007@858.59:861.33 AND HE COULD HAVE WRITTEN QUITE AN ESSAY ON WHAT I DID OVER MY
MurrayGellMann_2007@867.96:869.98 SO WE DON'T HAVE TO ASSUME THESE PRINCIPLES
MurrayGellMann_2007@871.14:873.16 AS SEPARATE METAPHYSICAL POSTULATES
MurrayGellMann_2007@878.36:881.20 THEY FOLLOW FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL THEORY
MurrayGellMann_2007@883.22:885.77 THEY ARE WHAT WE CALL EMERGENT PROPERTIES
MurrayGellMann_2007@886.45:887.79 YOU DON'T NEED
MurrayGellMann_2007@888.54:892.09 YOU DON'T NEED SOMETHING MORE TO GET SOMETHING MORE
MurrayGellMann_2007@895.03:897.49 LIFE CAN EMERGE FROM
MurrayGellMann_2007@899.28:901.97 PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY PLUS A LOT OF ACCIDENTS
MurrayGellMann_2007@903.79:908.67 THE HUMAN MIND CAN ARISE FROM NEUROBIOLOGY AND A LOT OF ACCIDENTS
MurrayGellMann_2007@916.77:919.10 DOESN'T DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE OF
MurrayGellMann_2007@920.57:926.56 TO KNOW THAT THEY FOLLOW FROM MORE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS PLUS ACCIDENTS THAT'S A GENERAL RULE
MurrayGellMann_2007@927.34:936.38 AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT YOU DON'T NEED SOMETHING MORE IN ORDER TO GET SOMETHING MORE PEOPLE KEEP ASKING THAT
MurrayGellMann_2007@936.72:945.13 WHEN THEY READ MY BOOK THE QUARK AND THE JAGUAR AND THEY SAY ISN 'T THERE SOMETHING MORE BEYOND WHAT YOU HAVE THERE PRESUMABLY THEY MEAN SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL
MurrayGellMann_2007@947.50:951.28 ANYWAY THERE ISN 'T YOU DON'T NEED SOMETHING MORE
MurrayGellMann_2007@952.34:955.45 TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING MORE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
