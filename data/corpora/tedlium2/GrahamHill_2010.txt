GrahamHill_2010 QUESTION KNOWING WHAT I KNOW WHY AM I NOT A VEGETARIAN
GrahamHill_2010 AFTER ALL I'M ONE OF THE GREEN GUYS I GREW UP WITH HIPPIE PARENTS IN A LOG CABIN I STARTED A SITE CALLED TREEHUGGER
GrahamHill_2010 CRUELTY I KNEW THAT THE TEN BILLION ANIMALS WE RAISE EACH YEAR FOR MEAT ARE RAISED IN FACTORY FARM CONDITIONS THAT WE HYPOCRITICALLY WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDER FOR OUR OWN CATS
GrahamHill_2010 DOGS AND OTHER PETS
GrahamHill_2010 CAUSES MORE EMISSIONS THAN ALL OF TRANSPORTATION COMBINED CARS TRAINS PLANES BUSES BOATS ALL OF IT
GrahamHill_2010 AND BEEF PRODUCTION USES ONE HUNDRED TIMES THE WATER THAT MOST VEGETABLES DO
GrahamHill_2010 WE AS A SOCIETY ARE EATING TWICE AS MUCH MEAT AS WE
GrahamHill_2010 SO WHY WAS I STALLING
GrahamHill_2010 I REALIZED THAT WHAT I WAS BEING PITCHED WAS A BINARY SOLUTION
GrahamHill_2010 IT WAS EITHER YOU'RE A MEAT EATER OR YOU'RE A VEGETARIAN
GrahamHill_2010 AND I GUESS I JUST WASN'T QUITE READY
GrahamHill_2010 IMAGINE YOUR LAST HAMBURGER
GrahamHill_2010 SO MY COMMON SENSE MY GOOD INTENTIONS
GrahamHill_2010 SO I WONDERED
GrahamHill_2010 I THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND I CAME UP WITH ONE
GrahamHill_2010 THE NAME SAYS IT ALL
GrahamHill_2010 A FACE MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY ON THE WEEKEND YOUR CHOICE
GrahamHill_2010 IF YOU WANT TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL REMEMBER THE MAJOR CULPRITS IN TERMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE
GrahamHill_2010 AND HEALTH ARE RED AND PROCESSED MEATS SO YOU WANT TO SWAP THOSE OUT WITH SOME GOOD SUSTAINABLY HARVESTED FISH
GrahamHill_2010 IT'S STRUCTURED SO IT ENDS UP BEING SIMPLE TO REMEMBER AND IT'S OKAY TO BREAK IT HERE AND THERE
GrahamHill_2010 AFTER ALL CUTTING FIVE DAYS A WEEK IS CUTTING SEVENTY PERCENT OF YOUR MEAT INTAKE
GrahamHill_2010 THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN GREAT WEEKDAY VEG MY FOOTPRINT 'S SMALLER
GrahamHill_2010 LESSENING POLLUTION
GrahamHill_2010 I FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE ANIMALS I'M EVEN SAVING MONEY
GrahamHill_2010 BEST OF ALL I'M HEALTHIER I KNOW THAT I'M GOING TO LIVE LONGER
GrahamHill_2010 A LITTLE WEIGHT
GrahamHill_2010 SO PLEASE ASK YOURSELVES FOR YOUR HEALTH
GrahamHill_2010 WHAT'S STOPPING YOU FROM GIVING WEEKDAY VEG A SHOT
GrahamHill_2010 IF ALL OF US ATE HALF AS MUCH MEAT
