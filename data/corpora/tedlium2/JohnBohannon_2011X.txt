JohnBohannon_2011X GOOD AFTERNOON
JohnBohannon_2011X AS YOU 'RE ALL AWARE WE FACE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC TIMES
JohnBohannon_2011X I COME TO YOU WITH A MODEST PROPOSAL
JohnBohannon_2011X FOR EASING THE FINANCIAL BURDEN
JohnBohannon_2011X THIS IDEA CAME TO ME WHILE TALKING TO A PHYSICIST FRIEND OF MINE AT MIT
JohnBohannon_2011X HE WAS STRUGGLING TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME A BEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENT THAT USES LASERS TO COOL DOWN MATTER
JohnBohannon_2011X NOW HE CONFUSED ME FROM THE VERY START BECAUSE LIGHT DOESN 'T COOL THINGS DOWN
JohnBohannon_2011X AND THAT 'S WHY YOUR BRAIN IS FORMING AN IMAGE OF ME STANDING HERE NOW A LASER IS DIFFERENT IT ALSO USES PHOTONS BUT THEY 'RE ALL SYNCHRONIZED AND IF YOU FOCUS THEM INTO A BEAM WHAT YOU HAVE IS AN INCREDIBLY USEFUL TOOL
JohnBohannon_2011X THE CONTROL OF A LASER IS SO PRECISE THAT YOU CAN
JohnBohannon_2011X PERFORM SURGERY INSIDE OF AN EYE YOU CAN USE IT TO STORE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DATA AND YOU CAN USE IT FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENT THAT MY FRIEND WAS STRUGGLING TO EXPLAIN FIRST YOU TRAP
JohnBohannon_2011X ATOMS IN A SPECIAL BOTTLE
JohnBohannon_2011X IT USES ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS TO ISOLATE THE ATOMS FROM THE NOISE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE ATOMS THEMSELVES ARE QUITE VIOLENT BUT IF YOU FIRE LASERS THAT ARE PRECISELY TUNED TO THE RIGHT FREQUENCY AN ATOM WILL BRIEFLY ABSORB THOSE PHOTONS AND TEND TO SLOW DOWN LITTLE BY LITTLE
JohnBohannon_2011X IT GETS COLDER UNTIL EVENTUALLY IT APPROACHES ABSOLUTE ZERO
JohnBohannon_2011X NOW IF YOU USE THE RIGHT KIND OF ATOMS
JohnBohannon_2011X IT 'S NO LONGER A SOLID A LIQUID OR A GAS
JohnBohannon_2011X IT ENTERS A NEW STATE OF MATTER CALLED A SUPERFLUID THE ATOMS LOSE THEIR INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY AND THE RULES FROM THE QUANTUM WORLD TAKE OVER AND THAT 'S WHAT GIVES SUPERFLUIDS SUCH SPOOKY PROPERTIES FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU SHINE LIGHT
JohnBohannon_2011X THROUGH A SUPERFLUID IT IS ABLE TO SLOW PHOTONS DOWN TO SIXTY KILOMETERS PER HOUR
JohnBohannon_2011X ANOTHER SPOOKY PROPERTY IS THAT IT FLOWS WITH ABSOLUTELY NO VISCOSITY OR FRICTION SO IF YOU WERE TO TAKE THE LID OFF THAT BOTTLE IT WON 'T STAY INSIDE
JohnBohannon_2011X A THIN FILM WILL CREEP UP THE INSIDE WALL FLOW OVER THE TOP AND RIGHT OUT THE OUTSIDE
JohnBohannon_2011X NOW OF COURSE THE MOMENT THAT IT DOES HIT THE OUTSIDE ENVIRONMENT
JohnBohannon_2011X AND ITS TEMPERATURE RISES BY EVEN A FRACTION OF A DEGREE IT IMMEDIATELY TURNS BACK INTO NORMAL MATTER
JohnBohannon_2011X SUPERFLUIDS ARE ONE OF THE MOST FRAGILE THINGS WE 'VE EVER DISCOVERED AND THIS IS THE GREAT PLEASURE OF SCIENCE THE DEFEAT OF OUR INTUITION THROUGH EXPERIMENTATION BUT THE EXPERIMENT IS NOT THE END OF THE STORY BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE TO TRANSMIT THAT KNOWLEDGE TO OTHER PEOPLE
JohnBohannon_2011X I HAVE A PH D IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY I STILL BARELY UNDERSTAND WHAT MOST SCIENTISTS ARE TALKING ABOUT
JohnBohannon_2011X SO AS MY FRIEND WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT EXPERIMENT IT SEEMED LIKE
JohnBohannon_2011X THE MORE HE SAID THE LESS I UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE IF YOU 'RE TRYING TO GIVE SOMEONE THE BIG PICTURE OF A COMPLEX IDEA TO REALLY CAPTURE ITS ESSENCE THE FEWER WORDS YOU USE THE BETTER
JohnBohannon_2011X IN FACT THE IDEAL MAY BE TO USE NO WORDS AT ALL I REMEMBER THINKING MY FRIEND COULD HAVE EXPLAINED THAT ENTIRE EXPERIMENT WITH A DANCE OF COURSE THERE NEVER SEEM TO BE ANY DANCERS AROUND WHEN YOU NEED THEM
JohnBohannon_2011X NOW THE IDEA IS NOT AS CRAZY AS IT SOUNDS I STARTED A CONTEST FOUR YEARS AGO CALLED DANCE YOUR PH D INSTEAD OF EXPLAINING THEIR RESEARCH WITH WORDS SCIENTISTS HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT WITH DANCE NOW SURPRISINGLY IT SEEMS TO WORK
JohnBohannon_2011X DANCE REALLY CAN MAKE SCIENCE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND BUT DON 'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT GO ON THE INTERNET AND SEARCH FOR DANCE YOUR PH D THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF DANCING SCIENTISTS WAITING FOR YOU
JohnBohannon_2011X THE MOST SURPRISING THING THAT I 'VE LEARNED WHILE RUNNING THIS CONTEST IS THAT SOME SCIENTISTS ARE NOW WORKING DIRECTLY WITH DANCERS ON THEIR RESEARCH FOR EXAMPLE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA THERE 'S A BIOMEDICAL ENGINEER NAMED DAVID ODDE AND HE WORKS WITH DANCERS TO STUDY HOW CELLS MOVE THEY DO IT BY CHANGING THEIR SHAPE
JohnBohannon_2011X WHEN A CHEMICAL SIGNAL WASHES UP ON ONE SIDE IT TRIGGERS THE CELL TO EXPAND ITS SHAPE ON THAT SIDE BECAUSE THE CELL IS CONSTANTLY TOUCHING AND TUGGING AT THE ENVIRONMENT SO THAT ALLOWS CELLS TO OOZE ALONG IN THE RIGHT DIRECTIONS BUT WHAT SEEMS SO SLOW AND GRACEFUL FROM THE OUTSIDE
JohnBohannon_2011X IS REALLY MORE LIKE CHAOS INSIDE BECAUSE CELLS CONTROL THEIR SHAPE WITH A SKELETON OF RIGID PROTEIN FIBERS AND THOSE FIBERS ARE CONSTANTLY FALLING APART
JohnBohannon_2011X BUT JUST AS QUICKLY AS THEY EXPLODE MORE PROTEINS ATTACH TO THE ENDS AND GROW THEM LONGER SO IT 'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING JUST TO REMAIN EXACTLY THE SAME NOW DAVID BUILDS MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF THIS AND THEN HE TESTS THOSE IN THE LAB BUT BEFORE HE DOES THAT
JohnBohannon_2011X HE WORKS WITH DANCERS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT KINDS OF MODELS TO BUILD IN THE FIRST PLACE IT 'S BASICALLY EFFICIENT BRAINSTORMING AND WHEN I VISITED DAVID TO LEARN ABOUT HIS RESEARCH HE USED DANCERS TO EXPLAIN IT TO ME RATHER THAN THE USUAL METHOD
JohnBohannon_2011X I THINK THAT BAD POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS ARE A SERIOUS THREAT TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
JohnBohannon_2011X AND IT CONSERVATIVELY ASSUMES THAT ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE PRESENTATIONS ARE A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND GIVEN THAT THERE ARE SOME APPARENTLY THIRTY MILLION POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS CREATED EVERY DAY THAT WOULD INDEED ADD UP TO AN ANNUAL WASTE OF ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS
JohnBohannon_2011X THERE ARE OTHER COSTS BECAUSE POWERPOINT IS A TOOL AND LIKE ANY TOOL IT CAN AND WILL BE ABUSED TO BORROW A CONCEPT FROM MY COUNTRY 'S CIA IT HELPS YOU TO SOFTEN UP YOUR AUDIENCE
JohnBohannon_2011X IT DISTRACTS THEM WITH PRETTY PICTURES IRRELEVANT DATA IT ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE THE ILLUSION OF COMPETENCE THE ILLUSION OF SIMPLICITY AND MOST DESTRUCTIVELY THE ILLUSION OF UNDERSTANDING SO NOW MY COUNTRY IS FIFTEEN TRILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT
JohnBohannon_2011X OUR LEADERS ARE WORKING TIRELESSLY TO TRY AND FIND WAYS TO SAVE MONEY ONE IDEA IS TO DRASTICALLY REDUCE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE ARTS FOR EXAMPLE OUR NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS WITH ITS DOLLAR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION BUDGET SLASHING THAT PROGRAM WOULD IMMEDIATELY REDUCE THE NATIONAL DEBT BY ABOUT ONE ONE THOUSANDTH OF A PERCENT
JohnBohannon_2011X ONE CERTAINLY CAN 'T ARGUE WITH THOSE NUMBERS HOWEVER
JohnBohannon_2011X ONCE WE ELIMINATE PUBLIC FUNDING FOR THE ARTS THERE WILL BE SOME DRAWBACKS
JohnBohannon_2011X THE ARTISTS ON THE STREET WILL SWELL THE RANKS OF THE UNEMPLOYED
JohnBohannon_2011X MANY WILL TURN TO DRUG ABUSE AND PROSTITUTION AND THAT WILL INEVITABLY LOWER PROPERTY VALUES IN URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS ALL OF THIS COULD WIPE OUT THE SAVINGS WE 'RE HOPING TO MAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE
JohnBohannon_2011X WHICH I HOPE WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO THE LEAST OBJECTION
JohnBohannon_2011X ONCE WE ELIMINATE PUBLIC FUNDING FOR THE ARTISTS LET 'S PUT THEM BACK TO WORK BY USING THEM INSTEAD OF POWERPOINT AS A TEST CASE I PROPOSE WE START WITH AMERICAN DANCERS AFTER ALL THEY ARE THE MOST PERISHABLE OF THEIR KIND PRONE TO INJURY AND VERY SLOW TO HEAL DUE TO OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
JohnBohannon_2011X IMAGINE OUR POLITICIANS USING DANCE TO EXPLAIN WHY WE MUST INVADE A FOREIGN COUNTRY OR BAIL OUT AN INVESTMENT BANK
JohnBohannon_2011X IN THE DEEP FUTURE A TECHNOLOGY OF PERSUASION EVEN MORE POWERFUL THAN POWERPOINT MAY BE INVENTED RENDERING DANCERS UNNECESSARY AS TOOLS OF RHETORIC
JohnBohannon_2011X HOWEVER I TRUST THAT BY THAT DAY WE SHALL HAVE PASSED THIS PRESENT FINANCIAL CALAMITY
JohnBohannon_2011X PERHAPS BY THEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE LUXURY OF JUST
JohnBohannon_2011X SITTING IN AN AUDIENCE
JohnBohannon_2011X WITH NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO WITNESS THE HUMAN FORM IN MOTION
