MichaelMerzenich_2004@13.48:23.81 WHICH WE ALL HAVE RESIDING IN OUR SKULLS REMINDS ME OF AN APHORISM OF A COMMENT OF WOODY ALLEN TO ASK ABOUT WHAT IS THE VERY BEST THING TO HAVE WITHIN YOUR SKULL AND IT'S THIS MACHINE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@24.17:32.20 AND IT'S CONSTRUCTED FOR CHANGE IT'S ALL ABOUT CHANGE IT CONFERS ON US THE ABILITY TO DO THINGS TOMORROW THAT WE CAN'T DO TODAY THINGS TODAY THAT WE COULDN'T DO YESTERDAY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@32.63:33.95 AND OF COURSE IT'S BORN STUPID
MichaelMerzenich_2004@35.17:38.21 THE LAST TIME YOU WERE IN THE PRESENCE OF A BABY THIS HAPPENS TO BE MY GRANDDAUGHTER
MichaelMerzenich_2004@43.01:50.27 WHEN SHE POPPED OUT DESPITE THE FACT THAT HER BRAIN HAD ACTUALLY BEEN PROGRESSING IN ITS DEVELOPMENT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE ON THE BASIS OF HER EXPERIENCES IN THE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@51.35:54.15 SHE HAD VERY LIMITED ABILITIES AS DOES EVERY INFANT
MichaelMerzenich_2004@54.72:57.21 AT THE TIME OF NORMAL NATURAL FULL TERM BIRTH
MichaelMerzenich_2004@62.10:70.06 NO REAL INDICATION THAT THERE IS ANY REAL THINKING GOING ON IN FACT THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS ANY COGNITIVE ABILITY IN A VERY YOUNG INFANT
MichaelMerzenich_2004@78.15:83.64 AND THEY CAN ONLY IN A VERY PRIMITIVE WAY AND IN A VERY LIMITED WAY CONTROL THEIR MOVEMENTS IT WOULD BE SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@84.68:90.27 DO SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS REACH OUT AND GRASP UNDER VOLUNTARY CONTROL AN OBJECT AND RETRIEVE IT USUALLY TO THE MOUTH
MichaelMerzenich_2004@92.99:97.00 AND WE SEE A LONG STEADY PROGRESSION OF THE EVOLUTION FROM THE FIRST WIGGLES
MichaelMerzenich_2004@97.60:104.75 TO ROLLING OVER AND SITTING UP AND CRAWLING STANDING WALKING BEFORE WE GET TO THAT MAGICAL POINT IN WHICH WE CAN MOTATE IN THE WORLD
MichaelMerzenich_2004@105.83:109.97 AND YET WHEN WE LOOK FORWARD IN THE BRAIN WE SEE REALLY REMARKABLE ADVANCE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@129.21:137.74 THE BRAIN CONTROLS VERY REFINED PERCEPTUAL ABILITIES AND IT ACTUALLY HAS A GROWING REPERTOIRE OF COGNITIVE SKILLS THIS BRAIN IS VERY MUCH A THINKING MACHINE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@143.74:149.05 IT HAS A PERSON ON BOARD AND IN FACT AT THIS AGE IT IS SUBSTANTIALLY CONTROLLING ITS OWN SELF DEVELOPMENT
MichaelMerzenich_2004@149.51:153.76 AND BY THIS AGE WE SEE A REMARKABLE EVOLUTION IN ITS CAPACITY TO CONTROL MOVEMENT
MichaelMerzenich_2004@154.76:166.39 NOW MOVEMENT HAS ADVANCED TO THE POINT WHERE IT CAN ACTUALLY CONTROL MOVEMENT SIMULTANEOUSLY IN A COMPLEX SEQUENCE IN COMPLEX WAYS AS WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR EXAMPLE FOR PLAYING A COMPLICATED GAME LIKE SOCCER
MichaelMerzenich_2004@167.21:169.68 NOW THIS BOY CAN BOUNCE A SOCCER BALL ON HIS HEAD
MichaelMerzenich_2004@170.29:176.07 AND WHERE THIS BOY COMES FROM SAO PAULO BRAZIL ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF BOYS OF HIS AGE HAVE THIS ABILITY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@189.88:198.13 THAT OUR INDIVIDUAL SKILLS AND ABILITIES ARE VERY MUCH SHAPED BY OUR ENVIRONMENTS THAT ENVIRONMENT EXTENDS INTO OUR CONTEMPORARY CULTURE THE THING OUR BRAIN IS CHALLENGED WITH
MichaelMerzenich_2004@198.51:206.56 BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE DONE IN OUR PERSONAL EVOLUTIONS IS BUILD UP A LARGE REPERTOIRE OF SPECIFIC SKILLS AND ABILITIES THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL HISTORIES
MichaelMerzenich_2004@206.86:214.43 AND IN FACT THEY RESULT IN A WONDERFUL DIFFERENTIATION IN HUMANKIND IN THE WAY THAT IN FACT NO TWO OF US ARE QUITE ALIKE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@215.27:224.81 EVERY ONE OF US HAS A DIFFERENT SET OF ACQUIRED SKILLS AND ABILITIES THAT ALL DERIVE OUT OF THE PLASTICITY THE ADAPTABILITY OF THIS REALLY REMARKABLE ADAPTIVE MACHINE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@225.67:232.98 IN AN ADULT BRAIN OF COURSE WE'VE BUILT UP A LARGE REPERTOIRE OF MASTERED SKILLS AND ABILITIES THAT WE CAN PERFORM MORE OR LESS AUTOMATICALLY FROM MEMORY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@239.09:243.61 NOW WE STUDY THIS AS THE NERDY LABORATORY UNIVERSITY BASED SCIENTISTS THAT WE ARE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@243.96:247.35 BY ENGAGING THE BRAINS OF ANIMALS LIKE RATS
MichaelMerzenich_2004@254.87:261.52 TO ENGAGE THEM IN LEARNING NEW SKILLS AND ABILITIES AND WE TRY TO TRACK THE CHANGES THAT OCCUR AS THE NEW SKILL OR ABILITY IS ACQUIRED
MichaelMerzenich_2004@262.20:264.37 IN FACT WE DO THIS IN INDIVIDUALS
MichaelMerzenich_2004@264.85:268.74 OF ANY AGE IN THESE DIFFERENT SPECIES THAT IS TO SAY FROM INFANCIES
MichaelMerzenich_2004@269.32:271.49 INFANCY UP TO ADULTHOOD AND OLD AGE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@272.67:281.05 SO WE MIGHT ENGAGE A RAT FOR EXAMPLE TO ACQUIRE A NEW SKILL OR ABILITY THAT MIGHT INVOLVE THE RAT USING ITS PAW TO MASTER PARTICULAR MANUAL GRASP
MichaelMerzenich_2004@291.73:302.50 MIGHT LOOK IN AN OLDER INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS MASTERED A COMPLEX SET OF ABILITIES THAT MIGHT RELATE TO READING MUSICAL NOTATION OR PERFORMING THE MECHANICAL ACTS OF PERFORMANCE THAT APPLY TO MUSICAL PERFORMANCE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@303.45:305.16 FROM THESE STUDIES WE DEFINED
MichaelMerzenich_2004@306.80:308.43 THE PLASTIC HISTORY OF THE BRAIN
MichaelMerzenich_2004@309.25:312.06 THE FIRST GREAT EPOCH IS COMMONLY CALLED THE CRITICAL PERIOD
MichaelMerzenich_2004@320.61:323.28 IN WHICH IT DOESN'T TAKE LEARNING PER SE TO DRIVE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@326.70:330.72 ALL IT TAKES FOR EXAMPLE IN THE SOUND DOMAIN IS EXPOSURE TO SOUND
MichaelMerzenich_2004@337.73:342.77 SO FOR EXAMPLE I CAN REAR AN ANIMAL IN AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THERE IS MEANINGLESS DUMB SOUND
MichaelMerzenich_2004@346.48:352.27 THAT I MAKE JUST BY EXPOSURE ARTIFICIALLY IMPORTANT TO THE ANIMAL AND ITS YOUNG BRAIN AND WHAT I SEE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@352.61:362.14 IS THAT THE ANIMAL 'S BRAIN SETS UP ITS INITIAL PROCESSING OF THAT SOUND IN A FORM THAT'S IDEALIZED WITHIN THE LIMITS OF ITS PROCESSING ACHIEVEMENTS TO REPRESENT IT IN AN ORGANIZED AND ORDERLY WAY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@363.36:365.72 THE SOUND DOESN'T HAVE TO BE VALUABLE TO THE ANIMAL
MichaelMerzenich_2004@366.39:369.47 I COULD RAISE THE ANIMAL IN SOMETHING THAT COULD BE HYPOTHETICALLY VALUABLE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@370.01:376.34 LIKE THE SOUNDS THAT SIMULATE THE SOUNDS OF A NATIVE LANGUAGE OF A CHILD AND I SEE THE BRAIN ACTUALLY DEVELOP A PROCESSOR THAT
MichaelMerzenich_2004@377.98:386.85 SPECIALIZED FOR THAT COMPLEX ARRAY A REPERTOIRE OF SOUNDS IT ACTUALLY EXAGGERATES THEIR SEPARATENESS OF REPRESENTATION IN MULTI DIMENSIONAL NEURONAL REPRESENTATIONAL TERMS
MichaelMerzenich_2004@387.89:398.25 OR I CAN EXPOSE THE ANIMAL TO A COMPLETELY MEANINGLESS AND DESTRUCTIVE SOUND I CAN RAISE AN ANIMAL UNDER CONDITIONS THAT WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO RAISING A BABY UNDER A MODERATELY LOUD CEILING FAN
MichaelMerzenich_2004@398.61:400.39 IN THE PRESENCE OF CONTINUOUS NOISE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@400.79:403.70 AND WHEN I DO THAT I ACTUALLY SPECIALIZE THE BRAIN
MichaelMerzenich_2004@404.30:411.90 TO BE A MASTER PROCESSOR FOR THAT MEANINGLESS SOUND AND I FRUSTRATE ITS ABILITY TO REPRESENT ANY MEANINGFUL SOUND AS A CONSEQUENCE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@412.76:424.61 SUCH THINGS IN THE EARLY HISTORY OF BABIES OCCUR IN REAL BABIES AND THEY ACCOUNT FOR FOR EXAMPLE THE BEAUTIFUL EVOLUTION OF A LANGUAGE SPECIFIC PROCESSOR IN EVERY NORMALLY DEVELOPING
MichaelMerzenich_2004@425.63:436.69 AND DO THEY ALSO ACCOUNT FOR DEVELOPMENT OF DEFECTIVE PROCESSING IN A SUBSTANTIAL POPULATION OF CHILDREN WHO ARE MORE LIMITED AS A CONSEQUENCE IN THEIR LANGUAGE ABILITIES AT AN OLDER AGE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@439.65:444.14 IN THIS EARLY PERIOD OF PLASTICITY THE BRAIN ACTUALLY CHANGES OUTSIDE OF A LEARNING CONTEXT
MichaelMerzenich_2004@444.73:447.02 I DON'T HAVE TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT I HEAR
MichaelMerzenich_2004@448.42:450.51 THE INPUT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE TO BE MEANINGFUL
MichaelMerzenich_2004@464.52:466.79 BEGIN TO OPERATE ON IT IN A SELECTIVE WAY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@468.01:471.25 IN THE NEXT GREAT EPOCH OF LIFE WHICH APPLIES FOR MOST OF LIFE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@471.67:473.90 THE BRAIN IS ACTUALLY REFINING ITS MACHINERY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@474.30:480.96 AS IT MASTERS A WIDE REPERTOIRE OF SKILLS AND ABILITIES AND IN THIS EPOCH WHICH EXTENDS FROM LATE IN THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@481.36:484.26 TO DEATH IT'S ACTUALLY DOING THIS UNDER BEHAVIORAL CONTROL
MichaelMerzenich_2004@491.86:506.38 AND IT'S FOCUSING ON SKILL AFTER SKILL OR ABILITY AFTER ABILITY UNDER SPECIFIC ATTENTIONAL CONTROL IT'S A FUNCTION OF WHETHER A GOAL IN A BEHAVIOR IS ACHIEVED OR WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL IS REWARDED IN THE BEHAVIOR
MichaelMerzenich_2004@507.51:510.06 THIS IS ACTUALLY VERY POWERFUL
MichaelMerzenich_2004@510.53:517.96 THIS LIFELONG CAPACITY FOR PLASTICITY FOR BRAIN CHANGE IS POWERFULLY EXPRESSED IT IS THE BASIS OF OUR REAL DIFFERENTIATION ONE INDIVIDUAL FROM ANOTHER
MichaelMerzenich_2004@518.59:529.33 YOU CAN LOOK DOWN IN THE BRAIN OF AN ANIMAL THAT'S ENGAGED IN A SPECIFIC SKILL AND YOU CAN WITNESS OR DOCUMENT THIS CHANGE ON A VARIETY OF LEVELS SO HERE IS A VERY SIMPLE EXPERIMENT IT WAS ACTUALLY CONDUCTED ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO
MichaelMerzenich_2004@545.03:548.69 THE MONKEY ACTUALLY MASTERED THE TASK IN ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED PRACTICE TRIES
MichaelMerzenich_2004@549.34:555.78 SO IN THE BEGINNING THE MONKEY COULD NOT PERFORM THIS TASK AT ALL IT HAD A SUCCESS RATE OF ABOUT ONE IN EIGHT TRIES
MichaelMerzenich_2004@560.84:571.29 THE MONKEY GRADUALLY DEVELOPED A STRATEGY AND SEVEN HUNDRED OR SO TRIES LATER THE MONKEY IS PERFORMING IT FLAWLESSLY NEVER FAILS HE 'S SUCCESSFUL IN HIS RETRIEVAL OF FOOD WITH THIS TOOL EVERY TIME
MichaelMerzenich_2004@572.03:575.80 AT THIS POINT THE TASK IS BEING PERFORMED IN A BEAUTIFULLY STEREOTYPED WAY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@576.37:579.34 VERY BEAUTIFULLY REGULATED AND HIGHLY REPEATED TRIAL TO TRIAL
MichaelMerzenich_2004@579.70:583.03 WE CAN LOOK DOWN IN THE BRAIN OF THE MONKEY AND WE SEE THAT IT'S DISTORTED
MichaelMerzenich_2004@594.06:605.30 NOW THIS IS A MAP DOWN ON THE SURFACE OF THE BRAIN IN WHICH IN A VERY ELABORATE EXPERIMENT WE'VE RECONSTRUCTED THE RESPONSES LOCATION BY LOCATION IN A HIGHLY DETAILED RESPONSE MAPPING OF THE RESPONSES OF ITS NEURONS
MichaelMerzenich_2004@605.96:609.57 WE SEE HERE A RECONSTRUCTION OF HOW THE HAND IS REPRESENTED IN THE BRAIN
MichaelMerzenich_2004@620.54:629.38 WE LOOK AT THE SELECTIVITY OF RESPONSES IN THE CORTEX OF THE MONKEY WE SEE THAT THE MONKEY HAS ACTUALLY CHANGED THE FILTER CHARACTERISTICS WHICH REPRESENTS INPUT FROM THE SKIN
MichaelMerzenich_2004@629.60:638.55 OF THE FINGERTIPS THAT ARE ENGAGED IN OTHER WORDS THERE IS STILL A SINGLE SIMPLE REPRESENTATION OF THE FINGERTIPS IN THIS MOST ORGANIZED OF CORTICAL AREAS OF THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN OF THE BODY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@639.07:640.26 MONKEY HAS LIKE YOU
MichaelMerzenich_2004@641.30:650.75 AND YET NOW IT'S REPRESENTED IN SUBSTANTIALLY FINER GRAIN THE MONKEY IS GETTING MORE DETAILED INFORMATION FROM THESE SURFACES AND THAT IS AN UNKNOWN UNSUSPECTED MAYBE BY YOU
MichaelMerzenich_2004@651.20:652.86 PART OF ACQUIRING THE SKILL OR ABILITY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@653.66:661.96 NOW ACTUALLY WE'VE LOOKED IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT CORTICAL AREAS IN THE MONKEY LEARNING THIS TASK AND EACH ONE OF THEM CHANGES IN WAYS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO THE SKILL OR ABILITY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@662.36:664.74 SO FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN LOOK TO THE CORTICAL AREA
MichaelMerzenich_2004@668.80:681.69 WE LOOK IN CORTICAL AREAS THAT CONTROL SPECIFIC MOVEMENTS AND THE SEQUENCES OF MOVEMENTS THAT ARE REQUIRED IN THE BEHAVIOR AND SO FORTH THEY ARE ALL REMODELED THEY ALL BECOME SPECIALIZED FOR THE TASK AT HAND THERE ARE FIFTEEN OR TWENTY CORTICAL AREAS THAT ARE CHANGED SPECIFICALLY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@682.12:687.36 WHEN YOU LEARN A SIMPLE SKILL LIKE THIS AND THAT REPRESENTS IN YOUR BRAIN REALLY MASSIVE CHANGE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@688.41:695.54 IT REPRESENTS THE CHANGE IN A RELIABLE WAY OF THE RESPONSES OF TENS OF MILLIONS POSSIBLY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF NEURONS IN YOUR BRAIN
MichaelMerzenich_2004@696.61:702.02 IT REPRESENTS CHANGES OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS POSSIBLY BILLIONS OF SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS IN YOUR BRAIN
MichaelMerzenich_2004@702.80:707.23 THIS IS CONSTRUCTED BY PHYSICAL CHANGE AND THE LEVEL OF CONSTRUCTION THAT OCCURS
MichaelMerzenich_2004@721.24:725.75 WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IS THE SELECTIVE REPRESENTATIONS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE BRAIN
MichaelMerzenich_2004@726.17:738.06 BECAUSE IN MOST OF THE LIFE OF THE BRAIN THIS IS UNDER CONTROL OF BEHAVIORAL CONTEXT IT'S WHAT YOU PAY ATTENTION TO IT'S WHAT'S REWARDING TO YOU IT'S WHAT THE BRAIN REGARDS ITSELF AS POSITIVE AND IMPORTANT TO YOU
MichaelMerzenich_2004@742.45:748.38 AND THAT UNDERLIES YOUR SPECIALIZATION THAT IS WHY YOU IN YOUR MANY SKILLS AND ABILITIES ARE A UNIQUE SPECIALIST
MichaelMerzenich_2004@748.86:750.70 A SPECIALIST THAT'S VASTLY DIFFERENT
MichaelMerzenich_2004@751.04:752.74 IN YOUR PHYSICAL BRAIN IN DETAIL
MichaelMerzenich_2004@753.24:755.04 THE BRAIN OF AN INDIVIDUAL ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
MichaelMerzenich_2004@757.47:761.03 IN THE DETAILS FROM THE BRAIN OF THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL ONE THOUSAND YEARS AGO
MichaelMerzenich_2004@762.97:766.11 NOW ONE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS CHANGE PROCESS
MichaelMerzenich_2004@766.77:771.07 IS THAT INFORMATION IS ALWAYS RELATED TO OTHER INPUTS OR INFORMATION THAT
MichaelMerzenich_2004@772.47:783.70 IN IMMEDIATE TIME IN CONTEXT AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE BRAIN IS CONSTRUCTING REPRESENTATIONS OF THINGS THAT ARE CORRELATED IN LITTLE MOMENTS OF TIME AND THAT RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER IN LITTLE MOMENTS OF SUCCESSIVE TIME
MichaelMerzenich_2004@784.01:788.93 THE BRAIN IS RECORDING ALL INFORMATION AND DRIVING ALL CHANGE IN TEMPORAL CONTEXT
MichaelMerzenich_2004@802.27:806.37 OR YOURSELF AS THE ACTOR YOURSELF AS THE THINKER YOURSELF AS THE MOVER
MichaelMerzenich_2004@820.49:823.14 YOU YOU ARE CONSTRUCTED YOUR SELF IS CONSTRUCTED
MichaelMerzenich_2004@823.56:825.13 FROM THESE BILLIONS OF EVENTS
MichaelMerzenich_2004@831.99:833.90 THIS IS A MARVELOUSLY CONSTRUCTED
MichaelMerzenich_2004@834.33:836.85 THING THAT RESULTS IN INDIVIDUAL FORM
MichaelMerzenich_2004@847.33:856.37 NOW WE'VE USED THIS RESEARCH TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND NOT JUST HOW A NORMAL PERSON DEVELOPS AND ELABORATES THEIR SKILLS AND ABILITIES BUT ALSO TRY TO UNDERSTAND
MichaelMerzenich_2004@856.93:858.66 THE ORIGINS OF IMPAIRMENT
MichaelMerzenich_2004@861.14:867.59 DIFFERENCES OR VARIATIONS THAT MIGHT LIMIT THE CAPACITIES OF A CHILD OR AN ADULT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT USING THESE STRATEGIES
MichaelMerzenich_2004@868.50:871.09 ACTUALLY DESIGN BRAIN PLASTICITY BASED
MichaelMerzenich_2004@872.86:875.36 TO DRIVE CORRECTIONS IN THE MACHINERY OF A CHILD
MichaelMerzenich_2004@876.05:881.69 THAT INCREASES THE COMPETENCE OF THE CHILD AS A LANGUAGE RECEIVER AND USER AND THEREAFTER AS A READER
MichaelMerzenich_2004@882.71:893.52 I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT EXPERIMENTS THAT INVOLVE ACTUALLY USING THIS BRAIN SCIENCE FIRST OF ALL TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE LOSS OF FUNCTION AS WE AGE THEN BY USING IT IN A TARGETED APPROACH
MichaelMerzenich_2004@897.91:899.94 TO RECOVER FUNCTION IN OLD AGE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@912.18:919.41 THAT HAVE EARLY LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENTS AND THAT ARE GOING TO STRUGGLE TO LEARN TO READ IS THAT THEIR LANGUAGE PROCESSOR IS CREATED IN A DEFECTIVE FORM
MichaelMerzenich_2004@920.03:925.19 AND THE REASON THAT IT RISES IN A DEFECTIVE FORM IS BECAUSE EARLY IN THE BABY 'S BRAIN 'S LIFE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@926.44:928.13 THE MACHINE PROCESS IS NOISY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@929.15:931.41 IT'S THAT SIMPLE IT'S A SIGNAL TO NOISE PROBLEM
MichaelMerzenich_2004@939.54:945.16 I MIGHT SAY THE NOISE PROBLEM COULD ALSO OCCUR ON THE BASIS OF INFORMATION PROVIDED
MichaelMerzenich_2004@945.90:947.10 IN THE WORLD FROM THE EARS
MichaelMerzenich_2004@948.16:951.32 IF ANY THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE OLDER IN THE AUDIENCE KNOW
MichaelMerzenich_2004@951.73:955.32 THAT WHEN I WAS A CHILD WE UNDERSTOOD THAT A CHILD BORN WITH A CLEFT PALATE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@956.26:958.06 WITH WHAT WE CALLED MENTAL RETARDATION
MichaelMerzenich_2004@959.03:961.75 WE KNEW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE SLOW COGNITIVELY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@962.27:965.48 WE KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO STRUGGLE TO LEARN TO DEVELOP NORMAL LANGUAGE ABILITIES
MichaelMerzenich_2004@966.15:968.23 AND WE KNEW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO STRUGGLE TO LEARN TO READ
MichaelMerzenich_2004@969.43:972.70 MOST OF THEM WOULD BE INTELLECTUAL AND ACADEMIC FAILURES
MichaelMerzenich_2004@973.89:976.25 THAT'S DISAPPEARED THAT NO LONGER APPLIES
MichaelMerzenich_2004@986.15:989.77 ABOUT THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO THAT IF YOU SIMPLY FIX THE PROBLEM EARLY ENOUGH
MichaelMerzenich_2004@990.21:997.39 WHEN THE BRAIN IS STILL IN THIS INITIAL PLASTIC PERIOD SO IT CAN SET UP THIS MACHINERY ADEQUATELY IN THIS INITIAL SET UP TIME IN THE CRITICAL PERIOD
MichaelMerzenich_2004@997.84:1002.18 NONE OF THAT HAPPENS WHAT ARE YOU DOING BY OPERATING ON THE CLEFT PALATE TO CORRECT
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1006.85:1008.63 WHICH HAVE HAD THEM RELIABLY FULL
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1009.32:1012.92 EVERY SOUND THE CHILD HEARS UNCORRECTED IS MUFFLED IT'S DEGRADED
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1013.38:1016.24 THE CHILD 'S NATIVE LANGUAGE IS SUCH A CASE IS NOT ENGLISH
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1016.61:1017.69 IT'S NOT JAPANESE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1029.00:1030.37 AND THEN THE CHILD IS STUCK WITH IT
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1039.65:1042.08 THERE ARE MANY INHERITED FAULTS THAT CAN MAKE IT NOISIER
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1043.03:1045.18 AND THE NATIVE LANGUAGE FOR A CHILD WITH SUCH A BRAIN
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1047.14:1048.78 IT'S NOT ENGLISH IT'S NOISY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1054.32:1056.41 NOT NORMAL A DIFFERENT STRATEGY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1057.17:1065.53 BY A MACHINE THAT HAS DIFFERENT SPACE CONSTANTS AND YOU CAN LOOK IN THE BRAIN OF SUCH A CHILD AND RECORD THOSE TIME CONSTANTS THEY ARE ABOUT AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LONGER
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1066.34:1070.73 ABOUT ELEVEN TIMES LONGER IN DURATION ON AVERAGE THAN IN A NORMAL CHILD
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1104.01:1105.06 ABNORMAL NEUROLOGY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1105.78:1114.41 THESE CHILDREN INCREASINGLY IN EVALUATION AFTER EVALUATION IN THEIR OPERATIONS IN LANGUAGE AND THEIR OPERATIONS IN READING WE DOCUMENT THAT ABNORMAL NEUROLOGY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1116.30:1123.45 THE POINT IS IS THAT YOU CAN TRAIN THE BRAIN OUT OF THIS A WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS YOU CAN ACTUALLY RE REFINE THE PROCESSING CAPACITY OF THE MACHINERY BY CHANGING
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1124.34:1130.18 CHANGING IT IN DETAIL IT TAKES ABOUT THIRTY HOURS ON THE AVERAGE AND WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED THAT IN ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND KIDS TODAY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1131.96:1135.38 ACTUALLY ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN ARE BEING TRAINED AS WE SPEAK
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1136.24:1150.40 AND ACTUALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE IMPACTS THE IMPACTS ARE SUBSTANTIAL SO HERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION WHAT WE'RE MOST INTERESTED IN IS THESE KIDS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE DISTRIBUTION THIS IS FROM ABOUT THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN YOU CAN SEE THAT MOST OF THE CHILDREN ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE DISTRIBUTION ARE MOVING INTO THE MIDDLE OR THE RIGHT
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1150.77:1162.65 THIS IS IN A BROAD ASSESSMENT OF THEIR LANGUAGE ABILITIES THIS IS LIKE AN IQ TEST FOR LANGUAGE THE IMPACT IN THE DISTRIBUTION IF YOU TRAINED EVERY CHILD IN THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE TO SHIFT THE WHOLE DISTRIBUTION TO THE RIGHT AND NARROW THE DISTRIBUTION
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1163.38:1170.49 THIS IS A SUBSTANTIALLY LARGE IMPACT THINK OF A CLASSROOM OF CHILDREN IN THE LANGUAGE ARTS THINK OF THE CHILDREN ON THE SLOW SIDE OF THE CLASS
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1171.19:1174.42 WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO MOVE MOST OF THOSE CHILDREN TO THE MIDDLE OR TO THE RIGHT
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1175.31:1177.21 IN ADDITION TO ACCURATE LANGUAGE TRAINING
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1177.85:1181.92 IT ALSO FIXES MEMORY AND COGNITION SPEECH FLUENCY AND SPEECH PRODUCTION
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1182.42:1188.71 AND AN IMPORTANT LANGUAGE DEPENDENT SKILL IS ENABLED BY THIS TRAINING THAT IS TO SAY READING AND TO A LARGE EXTENT IT FIXES THE BRAIN
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1189.26:1190.98 YOU CAN LOOK DOWN IN THE BRAIN OF A CHILD
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1191.44:1194.09 IN A VARIETY OF TASKS THAT SCIENTISTS HAVE AT STANFORD
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1196.27:1203.72 AND MIT AND UCSF AND UCLA AND A NUMBER OF OTHER INSTITUTIONS AND CHILDREN OPERATING IN VARIOUS LANGUAGE BEHAVIORS
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1214.47:1216.08 CAN ALSO TAKE THE SAME APPROACH
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1216.79:1218.76 TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS IN AGING
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1226.01:1238.32 NOISE IS INCREASING IN THE BRAIN AND LEARNING MODULATION AND CONTROL IS DETERIORATING AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOOK DOWN ON THE BRAIN OF SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL AND WITNESS A CHANGE IN THE TIME CONSTANTS AND SPACE CONSTANTS WITH WHICH FOR EXAMPLE THE BRAIN IS REPRESENTING LANGUAGE AGAIN
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1239.03:1243.93 JUST AS THE BRAIN CAME OUT OF CHAOS AT THE BEGINNING IT'S GOING BACK INTO CHAOS IN THE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1244.94:1246.68 THIS RESULTS IN DECLINES IN MEMORY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1247.19:1249.97 IN COGNITION AND IN POSTURAL ABILITY AND AGILITY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1250.65:1259.58 IT TURNS OUT YOU CAN TRAIN THE BRAIN OF SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL THIS IS A SMALL POPULATION OF SUCH INDIVIDUALS TRAIN EQUALLY INTENSIVELY FOR ABOUT THIRTY HOURS THESE ARE EIGHTY TO NINETY YEAR OLDS
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1283.10:1285.13 TO THE MIDDLE OR THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE DISTRIBUTION
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1286.51:1288.77 AT RISK FOR SENILITY MORE OR LESS IMMEDIATELY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1289.25:1290.75 ARE NOW IN A PROTECTED POSITION
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1292.95:1301.56 MY ISSUES ARE TO TRY TO GET TO RESCUING OLDER CITIZENS MORE COMPLETELY AND IN LARGER NUMBERS BECAUSE I THINK THIS CAN BE DONE IN THIS ARENA ON A VAST SCALE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1301.89:1309.78 AND THE SAME FOR KIDS MY MAIN INTEREST IS HOW TO ELABORATE THIS SCIENCE TO ADDRESS OTHER MALADIES I'M SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED IN THINGS LIKE AUTISM AND CEREBRAL PALSY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1319.86:1321.98 YOUR ISSUES AS IT RELATES TO THIS SCIENCE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1322.60:1325.10 IS HOW TO MAINTAIN YOUR OWN HIGH FUNCTIONING LEARNING MACHINE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1326.06:1327.89 AND OF COURSE A WELL ORDERED LIFE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1328.30:1330.75 IN WHICH LEARNING IS A CONTINUOUS PART OF IT IS KEY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1331.10:1333.15 BUT ALSO IN YOUR FUTURE IS BRAIN AEROBICS
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1333.96:1337.37 GET READY FOR IT IT'S GOING TO BE A PART OF EVERY LIFE NOT TOO FAR IN THE FUTURE
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1337.90:1346.79 JUST LIKE PHYSICAL EXERCISE IS A PART OF EVERY WELL ORGANIZED LIFE IN THE CONTEMPORARY PERIOD THE OTHER WAY THAT WE WILL ULTIMATELY COME TO CONSIDER THIS
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1347.60:1349.17 LITERATURE AND THE SCIENCE THAT IS
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1357.63:1359.01 IT'S UNDER YOUR CONTROL
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1359.43:1363.22 THAT YOUR HAPPINESS YOUR WELL BEING YOUR ABILITIES YOUR CAPACITIES
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1368.79:1370.59 AND YOU'RE THE RESPONSIBLE AGENT AND PARTY
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1371.68:1375.77 OF COURSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL IGNORE THIS ADVICE IT WILL BE A LONG TIME BEFORE THEY REALLY UNDERSTAND
MichaelMerzenich_2004@1376.62:1379.52 NOW THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE AND NOT MY FAULT OKAY THANK YOU
