CarolynPorco_2009U TWO YEARS AGO HERE AT TED I REPORTED THAT WE HAD DISCOVERED AT SATURN WITH THE CASSINI SPACECRAFT AN ANOMALOUSLY WARM AND GEOLOGICALLY ACTIVE REGION AT THE SOUTHERN TIP OF THE SMALL
CarolynPorco_2009U MOON ENCELADUS SEEN HERE THIS REGION SEEN HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE CASSINI IMAGE TAKEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE
CarolynPorco_2009U THIS IS THE SOUTH POLAR REGION WITH THE FAMOUS TIGER STRIPE FRACTURES CROSSING THE SOUTH POLE AND SEEN JUST RECENTLY IN LATE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
CarolynPorco_2009U HERE IS THAT REGION AGAIN NOW HALF IN DARKNESS BECAUSE THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE IS EXPERIENCING THE ONSET OF AUGUST AND EVENTUALLY WINTER
CarolynPorco_2009U AND I ALSO REPORTED THAT WE'D MADE THIS MIND BLOWING DISCOVERY THIS ONCE IN A LIFETIME DISCOVERY OF TOWERING JETS ERUPTING FROM THOSE FRACTURES AT THE SOUTH POLE
CarolynPorco_2009U AND AT THAT TIME TWO YEARS AGO I MENTIONED THAT WE WERE SPECULATING THAT THESE JETS MIGHT IN FACT BE GEYSERS AND ERUPTING FROM POCKETS OR CHAMBERS OF LIQUID WATER UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE BUT WE WEREN'T REALLY SURE
CarolynPorco_2009U HOWEVER THE IMPLICATIONS OF THOSE RESULTS OF A POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THIS MOON THAT COULD SUPPORT PREBIOTIC CHEMISTRY AND PERHAPS LIFE ITSELF
CarolynPorco_2009U WERE SO EXCITING THAT IN THE INTERVENING TWO YEARS WE HAVE FOCUSED MORE ON ENCELADUS WE'VE FLOWN THE CASSINI SPACECRAFT BY THIS MOON NOW SEVERAL TIMES
CarolynPorco_2009U FLYING CLOSER AND DEEPER INTO THESE JETS INTO THE DENSER REGIONS OF THESE JETS SO THAT NOW WE HAVE COME AWAY WITH SOME VERY PRECISE COMPOSITIONAL MEASUREMENTS
CarolynPorco_2009U AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT THE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS COMING FROM THIS MOON ARE IN FACT MORE COMPLEX THAN WE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED
CarolynPorco_2009U WHILE THEY'RE NOT AMINO ACIDS WE'RE NOW FINDING THINGS LIKE PROPANE AND BENZENE HYDROGEN CYANIDE AND FORMALDEHYDE
CarolynPorco_2009U AND THE TINY WATER CRYSTALS HERE NOW LOOK FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE THEY ARE FROZEN DROPLETS OF SALTY WATER WHICH IS A DISCOVERY THAT SUGGESTS THAT NOT ONLY DO THE JETS COME FROM
CarolynPorco_2009U SO WE ARE VERY ENCOURAGED BY THESE RESULTS AND WE ARE MUCH MORE CONFIDENT NOW THAN WE WERE TWO YEARS AGO THAT WE MIGHT INDEED HAVE ON THIS MOON
CarolynPorco_2009U UNDER THE SOUTH POLE AN ENVIRONMENT OR A ZONE THAT IS HOSPITABLE TO LIVING ORGANISMS WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE LIVING ORGANISMS THERE OF COURSE IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MATTER AND THAT WILL HAVE TO AWAIT THE ARRIVAL BACK AT
CarolynPorco_2009U WHEN WE MIGHT JOURNEY TO THE SATURNINE SYSTEM AND VISIT THE ENCELADUS INTERPLANETARY GEYSER PARK JUST BECAUSE WE CAN
