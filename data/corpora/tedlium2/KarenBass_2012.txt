KarenBass_2012@19.71:23.5 I 'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO SEE SO MUCH OF OUR BEAUTIFUL
KarenBass_2012@23.68:42.1 AND THE PEOPLE AND CREATURES THAT LIVE ON IT AND MY PASSION WAS INSPIRED AT THE AGE OF SEVEN WHEN MY PARENTS FIRST TOOK ME TO MOROCCO AT THE EDGE OF THE SAHARA DESERT NOW IMAGINE A LITTLE BRIT SOMEWHERE THAT WASN 'T COLD AND DAMP LIKE HOME WHAT AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE
KarenBass_2012@42.21:44.51 AND IT MADE ME WANT TO EXPLORE MORE
KarenBass_2012@57.95:62.62 I 'M REALLY LUCKY BECAUSE I GET TO SHARE THAT WITH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE
KarenBass_2012@75.03:83.87 YOU MIGHT THINK THAT IT 'S QUITE HARD TO FIND NEW STORIES AND NEW SUBJECTS BUT NEW TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING THE WAY WE CAN FILM
KarenBass_2012@84.7:90.12 IT 'S ENABLING US TO GET FRESH NEW IMAGES AND TELL BRAND NEW STORIES
KarenBass_2012@91.12:92.66 IN NATURE 'S GREAT EVENTS
KarenBass_2012@93.28:96.47 A SERIES FOR THE BBC THAT I DID WITH DAVID ATTENBOROUGH
KarenBass_2012@96.58:98.23 WE WANTED TO DO JUST THAT
KarenBass_2012@110.85:115.08 SO WHAT WE DID WE WENT TO ALASKA
KarenBass_2012@115.37:121.69 WHICH IS WHERE THE GRIZZLIES RELY ON REALLY HIGH ALMOST INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAIN SLOPES FOR THEIR DENNING
KarenBass_2012@122.63:124.76 AND THE ONLY WAY TO FILM
KarenBass_2012@131.9:146.79 THROUGHOUT ALASKA AND BRITISH COLUMBIA THOUSANDS OF BEAR FAMILIES ARE EMERGING FROM THEIR WINTER SLEEP THERE IS NOTHING TO EAT UP HERE BUT THE CONDITIONS WERE IDEAL FOR HIBERNATION
KarenBass_2012@155.76:163.56 TO FIND FOOD MOTHERS MUST LEAD THEIR CUBS DOWN TO THE COAST WHERE THE SNOW WILL ALREADY BE MELTING
KarenBass_2012@168.45:174.75 GETTING DOWN CAN BE A CHALLENGE FOR SMALL
KarenBass_2012@208.79:213.68 AND INDEED THAT OF ALL BEARS AROUND THE NORTH PACIFIC DEPENDS
KarenBass_2012@217.83:226.16 I LOVE THAT SHOT I ALWAYS GET GOOSEBUMPS EVERY TIME I SEE IT THAT WAS FILMED FROM A HELICOPTER USING A GYRO STABILIZED CAMERA
KarenBass_2012@226.99:232.51 AND IT 'S A WONDERFUL BIT OF GEAR BECAUSE IT 'S LIKE HAVING A FLYING TRIPOD CRANE AND DOLLY ALL ROLLED INTO ONE
KarenBass_2012@232.53:235.46 BUT TECHNOLOGY ALONE ISN 'T ENOUGH
KarenBass_2012@236.22:241.46 TO REALLY GET THE MONEY SHOTS IT 'S DOWN TO BEING IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME
KarenBass_2012@241.48:260.14 AND THAT SEQUENCE WAS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT THE FIRST YEAR WE GOT NOTHING WE HAD TO GO BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE REMOTE PARTS OF ALASKA AND WE HUNG AROUND WITH A HELICOPTER FOR TWO WHOLE WEEKS AND EVENTUALLY WE GOT LUCKY
KarenBass_2012@261.1:268.06 THE CLOUD LIFTED THE WIND WAS STILL AND EVEN THE BEAR SHOWED UP AND WE MANAGED TO GET THAT MAGIC MOMENT
KarenBass_2012@274.85:278.08 BUT THE OTHER THING THAT REALLY REALLY EXCITES ME
KarenBass_2012@281.27:289.88 NOW WHEN I HEARD ABOUT ONE ANIMAL I KNEW WE HAD TO GET IT FOR MY NEXT SERIES UNTAMED AMERICAS FOR NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC
KarenBass_2012@290.32:292.16 IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE
KarenBass_2012@292.32:301.77 A NEW SPECIES OF BAT WAS DISCOVERED IN THE CLOUD FORESTS OF ECUADOR AND WHAT WAS AMAZING ABOUT THAT DISCOVERY IS THAT IT ALSO SOLVED THE MYSTERY
KarenBass_2012@302.01:304.39 OF WHAT POLLINATED A UNIQUE FLOWER
KarenBass_2012@311.87:313.61 SEE WHAT YOU THINK
KarenBass_2012@320.53:326.84 THE
KarenBass_2012@328.21:329.74 THE BOTTOM OF
KarenBass_2012@375.51:378.26 LONGEST RELATIVE TO BODY
KarenBass_2012@408.97:413.8 NOW PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME WHERE 'S YOUR FAVORITE PLACE ON THE PLANET
KarenBass_2012@414:418.55 AND THE TRUTH IS I JUST DON 'T HAVE ONE THERE ARE SO MANY WONDERFUL PLACES
KarenBass_2012@432.4:436.41 IT 'S THE ALTIPLANO IN THE HIGH ANDES OF SOUTH AMERICA
KarenBass_2012@436.89:440.89 AND IT 'S THE MOST OTHERWORLDLY PLACE I KNOW
KarenBass_2012@441.61:444.14 BUT AT FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEET IT 'S TOUGH
KarenBass_2012@444.19:445.77 IT 'S FREEZING COLD
KarenBass_2012@461.13:471.97 BUT THE ADVANTAGE OF THAT WONDERFUL THIN ATMOSPHERE IS THAT IT ENABLES YOU TO SEE THE STARS IN THE HEAVENS WITH AMAZING CLARITY HAVE A LOOK
KarenBass_2012@486.58:490.24 IT 'S CALLED THE ALTIPLANO OR HIGH PLAINS
KarenBass_2012@491.65:493.91 A PLACE OF EXTREMES
KarenBass_2012@542.77:545.88 SOME OF THE WORLD 'S ASTRONOMERS HAVE TELESCOPES NEARBY
