JaeRhimLee_2011G SO BPA MIMICS THE BODY 'S OWN HORMONES AND CAUSES NEUROLOGICAL AND REPRODUCTIVE PROBLEMS AND IT 'S EVERYWHERE A RECENT STUDY FOUND BPA IN NINETY THREE PERCENT OF PEOPLE SIX AND OLDER
JaeRhimLee_2011G DON 'T BECOME A CANNIBAL
JaeRhimLee_2011G SECOND WE ARE BOTH RESPONSIBLE FOR AND THE VICTIMS OF OUR OWN POLLUTION AND THIRD OUR BODIES ARE FILTERS AND STOREHOUSES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS
JaeRhimLee_2011G SO WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THESE TOXINS WHEN WE DIE THE SHORT ANSWER IS THEY RETURN TO THE ENVIRONMENT IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
JaeRhimLee_2011G CONTINUING THE CYCLE OF TOXICITY BUT OUR CURRENT FUNERAL PRACTICES MAKE THE SITUATION MUCH WORSE IF YOU 'RE CREMATED ALL THOSE TOXINS I MENTIONED ARE RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND THIS INCLUDES FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS OF MERCURY FROM OUR DENTAL FILLINGS ALONE EVERY YEAR
JaeRhimLee_2011G AND IN A TRADITIONAL AMERICAN FUNERAL A DEAD BODY IS COVERED WITH FILLERS AND COSMETICS TO MAKE IT LOOK ALIVE IT 'S THEN PUMPED WITH TOXIC FORMALDEHYDE TO SLOW DECOMPOSITION
JaeRhimLee_2011G SO BY TRYING TO PRESERVE OUR DEAD BODIES WE DENY DEATH POISON THE LIVING AND FURTHER HARM THE
JaeRhimLee_2011G GREEN OR NATURAL BURIALS WHICH DON 'T USE EMBALMING
JaeRhimLee_2011G I THINK THERE 'S A BETTER SOLUTION I 'M AN ARTIST SO I 'D LIKE TO OFFER A MODEST PROPOSAL AT THE INTERSECTION OF ART SCIENCE AND CULTURE THE INFINITY BURIAL PROJECT AN ALTERNATIVE BURIAL SYSTEM THAT USES MUSHROOMS TO DECOMPOSE AND CLEAN TOXINS IN BODIES
JaeRhimLee_2011G THE INFINITY BURIAL PROJECT BEGAN A FEW YEARS AGO WITH A FANTASY TO CREATE THE INFINITY MUSHROOM A NEW HYBRID MUSHROOM THAT WOULD DECOMPOSE BODIES CLEAN THE TOXINS AND DELIVER NUTRIENTS TO PLANT ROOTS LEAVING CLEAN COMPOST
JaeRhimLee_2011G BUT I LEARNED IT 'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CREATE A NEW HYBRID MUSHROOM
JaeRhimLee_2011G I ALSO LEARNED THAT SOME OF OUR TASTIEST MUSHROOMS CAN CLEAN ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS IN SOIL SO I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD TRAIN AN ARMY OF
JaeRhimLee_2011G TOXIN CLEANING EDIBLE MUSHROOMS TO EAT MY BODY
JaeRhimLee_2011G SO TODAY I 'M COLLECTING WHAT I SHED OR SLOUGH OFF MY HAIR SKIN AND NAILS AND I 'M FEEDING THESE TO EDIBLE MUSHROOMS
JaeRhimLee_2011G SO WHEN I DIE THE INFINITY MUSHROOMS WILL RECOGNIZE MY BODY AND BE ABLE TO EAT IT
JaeRhimLee_2011G IS NOT THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP THAT WE USUALLY ASPIRE TO HAVE WITH OUR FOOD WE WANT TO EAT NOT BE EATEN BY OUR FOOD BUT AS I WATCH THE MUSHROOMS GROW AND DIGEST MY BODY I IMAGINE THE
JaeRhimLee_2011G AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MY BODY AND THE
JaeRhimLee_2011G IT 'S A STEP TOWARDS ACCEPTING THE FACT THAT SOMEDAY I WILL DIE AND DECAY
JaeRhimLee_2011G IT 'S ALSO A STEP TOWARDS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY
JaeRhimLee_2011G THE INFINITY MUSHROOM IS A SUBSET OF DECOMPICULTURE I 'M CALLING BODY DECOMPICULTURE AND TOXIN REMEDIATION THE CULTIVATION OF ORGANISMS THAT DECOMPOSE AND CLEAN TOXINS IN BODIES
JaeRhimLee_2011G AND NOW ABOUT THESE NINJA PAJAMAS ONCE IT 'S COMPLETED I PLAN TO INTEGRATE THE INFINITY MUSHROOMS INTO A NUMBER OF OBJECTS
JaeRhimLee_2011G FIRST A BURIAL SUIT INFUSED WITH MUSHROOM SPORES THE MUSHROOM DEATH SUIT
JaeRhimLee_2011G THE SECOND PROTOTYPE OF THIS
JaeRhimLee_2011G THE DENDRITIC PATTERN YOU SEE MIMICS THE GROWTH OF MUSHROOM MYCELIA WHICH ARE THE EQUIVALENT OF PLANT ROOTS
JaeRhimLee_2011G A COCKTAIL OF CAPSULES THAT CONTAIN INFINITY MUSHROOM SPORES AND OTHER ELEMENTS THAT SPEED DECOMPOSITION AND TOXIN REMEDIATION THESE CAPSULES ARE EMBEDDED IN A NUTRIENT RICH JELLY A KIND OF SECOND SKIN WHICH DISSOLVES QUICKLY AND BECOMES BABY FOOD FOR THE GROWING MUSHROOMS
JaeRhimLee_2011G SO I PLAN TO FINISH THE MUSHROOM AND DECOMPICULTURE KIT IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO AND THEN I 'D LIKE TO BEGIN TESTING THEM FIRST WITH EXPIRED MEAT FROM THE MARKET AND THEN WITH HUMAN SUBJECTS
JaeRhimLee_2011G AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT A FEW PEOPLE HAVE OFFERED TO DONATE THEIR BODIES TO THE PROJECT TO BE EATEN BY MUSHROOMS
JaeRhimLee_2011G I 'VE LEARNED FROM TALKING TO THESE FOLKS IS THAT WE SHARE A COMMON DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT DEATH AND TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OUR DEATH ON
JaeRhimLee_2011G SO I FORMED THE DECOMPICULTURE SOCIETY A GROUP OF PEOPLE CALLED DECOMPINAUTS WHO ACTIVELY EXPLORE THEIR POSTMORTEM OPTIONS SEEK DEATH ACCEPTANCE AND CULTIVATE DECOMPOSING ORGANISMS LIKE THE INFINITY MUSHROOM
JaeRhimLee_2011G ACCEPTING DEATH MEANS ACCEPTING THAT WE ARE PHYSICAL BEINGS WHO ARE INTIMATELY CONNECTED TO THE ENVIRONMENT AS THE RESEARCH ON ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS CONFIRMS
JaeRhimLee_2011G WE SEE THAT THE SURVIVAL OF OUR SPECIES DEPENDS ON THE SURVIVAL OF THE PLANET
JaeRhimLee_2011G I BELIEVE THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF TRUE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY THANK YOU
