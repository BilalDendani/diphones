MargaretHeffernan_2013X THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE UNITED STATES RIGHT UP NEAR THE CANADIAN BORDER THERE 'S A LITTLE TOWN CALLED LIBBY MONTANA
MargaretHeffernan_2013X AND IT 'S SURROUNDED BY PINE TREES AND LAKES AND JUST AMAZING WILDLIFE AND THESE ENORMOUS TREES THAT SCREAM UP INTO THE SKY
MargaretHeffernan_2013X AND
MargaretHeffernan_2013X A LITTLE ISOLATED AND IN LIBBY MONTANA THERE 'S A RATHER UNUSUAL WOMAN NAMED GAYLA BENEFIELD
MargaretHeffernan_2013X SHE ALWAYS FELT A LITTLE BIT OF AN OUTSIDER ALTHOUGH SHE 'S BEEN THERE ALMOST ALL HER LIFE A WOMAN OF RUSSIAN EXTRACTION SHE TOLD ME WHEN SHE WENT TO SCHOOL SHE WAS THE ONLY GIRL WHO EVER CHOSE TO DO MECHANICAL DRAWING
MargaretHeffernan_2013X LATER IN LIFE SHE GOT A JOB GOING HOUSE TO HOUSE READING UTILITY METERS GAS METERS ELECTRICITY METERS AND SHE WAS DOING THE WORK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AND ONE THING PARTICULARLY CAUGHT HER NOTICE WHICH WAS
MargaretHeffernan_2013X IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY SHE MET A LOT OF MEN WHO WERE AT HOME
MargaretHeffernan_2013X AND A LOT OF THEM SEEMED TO BE ON OXYGEN TANKS
MargaretHeffernan_2013X THEN A FEW YEARS LATER HER FATHER DIED AT THE AGE OF FIFTY NINE FIVE DAYS BEFORE HE WAS DUE TO RECEIVE HIS PENSION HE 'D BEEN A MINER SHE THOUGHT HE MUST JUST HAVE BEEN WORN OUT BY THE WORK BUT
MargaretHeffernan_2013X THEN A FEW YEARS LATER HER MOTHER DIED AND THAT SEEMED STRANGER STILL BECAUSE HER MOTHER CAME FROM A LONG LINE OF PEOPLE WHO JUST SEEMED TO LIVE
MargaretHeffernan_2013X FOREVER IN FACT GAYLA 'S UNCLE IS STILL ALIVE TO THIS DAY AND LEARNING HOW TO WALTZ IT DIDN 'T MAKE SENSE THAT GAYLA 'S MOTHER SHOULD DIE SO YOUNG IT WAS AN ANOMALY
MargaretHeffernan_2013X AND SHE KEPT PUZZLING OVER ANOMALIES AND AS SHE DID OTHER ONES CAME TO MIND SHE REMEMBERED FOR EXAMPLE WHEN HER MOTHER HAD BROKEN A LEG AND WENT INTO THE HOSPITAL AND SHE HAD A LOT OF X RAYS AND TWO OF THEM WERE LEG X RAYS WHICH MADE SENSE BUT SIX OF THEM WERE CHEST X RAYS
MargaretHeffernan_2013X WHICH DIDN 'T SHE PUZZLED AND PUZZLED OVER EVERY PIECE OF HER LIFE AND HER PARENTS LIFE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE WAS SEEING SHE THOUGHT ABOUT HER TOWN THE TOWN
MargaretHeffernan_2013X HAD A VERMICULITE MINE IN IT VERMICULITE WAS USED FOR SOIL CONDITIONERS TO MAKE PLANTS GROW FASTER AND BETTER VERMICULITE WAS USED TO INSULATE LOFTS HUGE AMOUNTS OF IT PUT UNDER THE ROOF TO KEEP HOUSES WARM DURING THE LONG MONTANA WINTERS
MargaretHeffernan_2013X WHEN SHE FIGURED OUT THE PUZZLE SHE STARTED TELLING EVERYONE SHE COULD WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHAT HAD BEEN DONE TO HER PARENTS AND TO THE PEOPLE THAT SHE SAW ON OXYGEN TANKS AT HOME IN THE AFTERNOONS
MargaretHeffernan_2013X BUT SHE WAS REALLY AMAZED SHE THOUGHT WHEN EVERYBODY KNOWS THEY 'LL WANT TO DO SOMETHING BUT ACTUALLY NOBODY WANTED TO KNOW
MargaretHeffernan_2013X IN FACT SHE BECAME SO ANNOYING AS SHE KEPT INSISTING ON TELLING THIS STORY TO HER NEIGHBORS TO HER FRIENDS TO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY
MargaretHeffernan_2013X BUT GAYLA DIDN 'T STOP SHE KEPT DOING RESEARCH THE ADVENT OF THE INTERNET DEFINITELY HELPED HER SHE TALKED TO ANYBODY SHE COULD SHE ARGUED AND ARGUED AND FINALLY SHE STRUCK LUCKY
MargaretHeffernan_2013X WHEN A RESEARCHER CAME THROUGH TOWN STUDYING THE HISTORY OF MINES IN THE AREA AND SHE TOLD HIM HER STORY AND AT FIRST OF COURSE LIKE EVERYONE HE DIDN 'T BELIEVE HER BUT HE WENT BACK TO SEATTLE AND HE DID HIS OWN
MargaretHeffernan_2013X NEVERTHELESS PEOPLE STILL DIDN 'T WANT TO KNOW THEY SAID THINGS LIKE WELL IF IT WERE REALLY DANGEROUS SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TOLD US IF THAT 'S REALLY WHY EVERYONE WAS DYING THE DOCTORS WOULD HAVE TOLD US
MargaretHeffernan_2013X SOME OF THE GUYS USED TO VERY HEAVY JOBS SAID I DON 'T WANT TO BE A VICTIM I CAN 'T POSSIBLY BE A VICTIM AND ANYWAY EVERY INDUSTRY HAS ITS ACCIDENTS
MargaretHeffernan_2013X BUT STILL GAYLA WENT ON AND FINALLY SHE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A FEDERAL AGENCY TO COME TO TOWN AND TO SCREEN THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN
MargaretHeffernan_2013X FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY DISCOVERED WAS THAT THE TOWN HAD A MORTALITY RATE EIGHTY TIMES HIGHER THAN ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES
MargaretHeffernan_2013X LOOK IN THE PLAYGROUND WHERE YOUR GRANDCHILDREN ARE PLAYING IT 'S LINED WITH VERMICULITE THIS WASN 'T IGNORANCE IT WAS WILLFUL BLINDNESS
MargaretHeffernan_2013X WILLFUL BLINDNESS IS A LEGAL CONCEPT WHICH MEANS IF THERE 'S INFORMATION THAT YOU COULD KNOW AND YOU SHOULD KNOW BUT YOU SOMEHOW MANAGE NOT TO KNOW THE LAW DEEMS THAT YOU 'RE WILLFULLY BLIND YOU HAVE CHOSEN
MargaretHeffernan_2013X NOT TO KNOW
MargaretHeffernan_2013X THERE 'S A LOT OF WILLFUL BLINDNESS AROUND THESE DAYS YOU CAN SEE WILLFUL BLINDNESS IN BANKS
MargaretHeffernan_2013X WHEN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SOLD MORTGAGES TO PEOPLE WHO COULDN 'T AFFORD THEM YOU COULD SEE THEM IN BANKS WHEN INTEREST RATES WERE MANIPULATED AND EVERYONE AROUND KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON BUT EVERYONE STUDIOUSLY IGNORED IT
MargaretHeffernan_2013X YOU CAN SEE WILLFUL BLINDNESS IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WHERE DECADES OF CHILD ABUSE WENT IGNORED YOU COULD SEE WILLFUL BLINDNESS IN THE RUN UP TO THE IRAQ WAR
MargaretHeffernan_2013X WILLFUL BLINDNESS EXISTS ON EPIC SCALES LIKE THOSE AND IT ALSO EXISTS ON VERY SMALL SCALES IN PEOPLE 'S FAMILIES IN PEOPLE 'S HOMES AND COMMUNITIES AND PARTICULARLY IN ORGANIZATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS
MargaretHeffernan_2013X COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN STUDIED FOR WILLFUL BLINDNESS CAN BE ASKED QUESTIONS LIKE ARE THERE ISSUES AT WORK THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO RAISE
MargaretHeffernan_2013X AND WHEN ACADEMICS HAVE DONE STUDIES LIKE THIS OF CORPORATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES WHAT THEY FIND IS EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE SAY YES
MargaretHeffernan_2013X EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE KNOW THERE 'S A PROBLEM BUT THEY WON 'T SAY ANYTHING AND WHEN I DUPLICATED THE RESEARCH IN EUROPE
MargaretHeffernan_2013X ASKING ALL THE SAME QUESTIONS I FOUND EXACTLY THE SAME NUMBER EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT
MargaretHeffernan_2013X THAT 'S A LOT OF SILENCE IT 'S A LOT OF BLINDNESS AND WHAT 'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT WHEN I GO TO COMPANIES IN SWITZERLAND THEY TELL ME THIS IS A UNIQUELY SWISS PROBLEM AND WHEN I GO TO GERMANY THEY SAY OH YES THIS IS THE GERMAN DISEASE
MargaretHeffernan_2013X AND WHEN I GO TO COMPANIES IN ENGLAND THEY SAY OH YEAH THE BRITISH ARE REALLY BAD AT THIS
MargaretHeffernan_2013X AND THE TRUTH IS THIS IS A HUMAN PROBLEM WE 'RE ALL UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WILLFULLY BLIND
MargaretHeffernan_2013X WHAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS IS THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE BLIND OUT OF FEAR THEY 'RE AFRAID OF RETALIATION
MargaretHeffernan_2013X AND SOME PEOPLE ARE BLIND BECAUSE THEY THINK WELL SEEING ANYTHING IS JUST FUTILE NOTHING 'S EVER GOING TO CHANGE IF WE MAKE A PROTEST IF WE PROTEST AGAINST THE IRAQ WAR NOTHING CHANGES SO WHY BOTHER BETTER NOT TO SEE THIS STUFF AT ALL
MargaretHeffernan_2013X AND THE
MargaretHeffernan_2013X BUT WHAT I 'VE FOUND GOING AROUND THE WORLD AND TALKING TO WHISTLEBLOWERS
MargaretHeffernan_2013X WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM THEY ARE CRUSHED NOBODY WOULD WANT TO GO THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
MargaretHeffernan_2013X AND YET WHEN I TALK TO WHISTLEBLOWERS THE RECURRENT TONE THAT I HEAR IS PRIDE
MargaretHeffernan_2013X I THINK OF JOE DARBY WE ALL REMEMBER THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF ABU GHRAIB WHICH SO SHOCKED THE WORLD AND SHOWED THE KIND OF WAR THAT WAS BEING FOUGHT IN IRAQ
MargaretHeffernan_2013X BUT I WONDER WHO REMEMBERS JOE DARBY THE VERY OBEDIENT GOOD SOLDIER WHO FOUND THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS AND HANDED THEM IN
MargaretHeffernan_2013X AND HE SAID YOU KNOW I 'M NOT THE KIND OF GUY TO RAT PEOPLE OUT BUT SOME THINGS JUST CROSS THE LINE IGNORANCE IS BLISS THEY SAY BUT YOU CAN 'T PUT UP
MargaretHeffernan_2013X WITH THINGS LIKE THIS I TALKED TO STEVE BOLSIN A BRITISH DOCTOR WHO FOUGHT FOR FIVE YEARS TO DRAW ATTENTION TO A DANGEROUS SURGEON WHO WAS KILLING BABIES
MargaretHeffernan_2013X AND I ASKED HIM WHY HE DID IT AND HE SAID WELL IT WAS REALLY MY DAUGHTER WHO PROMPTED ME TO DO IT SHE CAME UP TO ME ONE NIGHT AND SHE JUST SAID DAD YOU CAN 'T LET THE KIDS DIE
MargaretHeffernan_2013X OR I THINK OF CYNTHIA THOMAS
MargaretHeffernan_2013X BY THEIR MENTAL CONDITION AND THE REFUSAL OF THE MILITARY TO RECOGNIZE AND ACKNOWLEDGE POST TRAUMATIC STRESS SYNDROME
MargaretHeffernan_2013X SHE SET UP A CAFE IN THE MIDDLE OF A MILITARY TOWN TO GIVE THEM LEGAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
MargaretHeffernan_2013X AND SHE SAID TO ME SHE SAID YOU KNOW MARGARET I ALWAYS USED TO SAY I DIDN 'T KNOW WHAT I WANTED TO BE WHEN I GROW UP
MargaretHeffernan_2013X BUT I 'VE FOUND MYSELF IN THIS CAUSE
MargaretHeffernan_2013X AND I 'LL NEVER BE THE SAME
MargaretHeffernan_2013X WE ALL ENJOY SO MANY FREEDOMS TODAY HARD WON FREEDOMS THE FREEDOM TO WRITE AND PUBLISH WITHOUT FEAR OF CENSORSHIP A FREEDOM THAT WASN 'T HERE THE LAST TIME I CAME TO HUNGARY A FREEDOM TO VOTE WHICH WOMEN IN PARTICULAR HAD TO FIGHT SO HARD FOR
MargaretHeffernan_2013X THE FREEDOM FOR PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES AND CULTURES AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION TO LIVE THE WAY THAT THEY WANT BUT FREEDOM DOESN 'T EXIST IF YOU DON 'T USE IT
MargaretHeffernan_2013X AND WHAT THEY 'RE VERY PREPARED TO DO IS RECOGNIZE THAT YES THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ARGUMENT AND YES I 'M GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF ROWS WITH MY NEIGHBORS AND MY COLLEAGUES AND MY FRIENDS
MargaretHeffernan_2013X BUT I 'M GOING TO BECOME VERY GOOD AT THIS CONFLICT I 'M GOING TO TAKE ON THE NAYSAYERS BECAUSE THEY 'LL MAKE MY ARGUMENT BETTER AND STRONGER I CAN COLLABORATE WITH MY OPPONENTS TO BECOME BETTER AT WHAT I DO
MargaretHeffernan_2013X THESE ARE PEOPLE OF IMMENSE PERSISTENCE INCREDIBLE PATIENCE AND AN ABSOLUTE DETERMINATION NOT TO BE BLIND AND NOT TO BE SILENT
MargaretHeffernan_2013X WHEN I WENT TO LIBBY MONTANA I VISITED THE ASBESTOSIS CLINIC THAT GAYLA BENEFIELD BROUGHT INTO BEING
MargaretHeffernan_2013X A PLACE WHERE AT FIRST SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WANTED HELP AND NEEDED MEDICAL ATTENTION WENT IN THE BACK DOOR BECAUSE THEY DIDN 'T WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHE 'D BEEN RIGHT I
MargaretHeffernan_2013X I SAT IN A DINER AND I WATCHED AS TRUCKS DROVE UP AND DOWN THE HIGHWAY CARTING AWAY THE EARTH OUT OF GARDENS
MargaretHeffernan_2013X AND REPLACING IT WITH FRESH UNCONTAMINATED SOIL
MargaretHeffernan_2013X I TOOK MY TWELVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WITH ME BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED HER TO MEET GAYLA AND SHE SAID WHY WHAT 'S THE BIG DEAL
MargaretHeffernan_2013X THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING ABOUT GAYLA IS SHE IS ORDINARY SHE 'S LIKE YOU AND SHE 'S LIKE ME SHE HAD FREEDOM AND SHE WAS READY TO USE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
