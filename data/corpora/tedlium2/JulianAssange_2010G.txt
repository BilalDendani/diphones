JulianAssange_2010G@16.67:28.90 IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT WIKILEAKS YOUR BABY HAS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS RELEASED MORE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD 'S MEDIA COMBINED CAN THAT POSSIBLY BE TRUE
JulianAssange_2010G@51.98:55.54 SO THESE ARE AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL CLASSICAL WHISTLEBLOWERS
JulianAssange_2010G@56.10:68.79 AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF WAYS FOR THEM TO GET INFORMATION TO US SO WE USE JUST STATE OF THE ART ENCRYPTION TO BOUNCE STUFF AROUND THE INTERNET TO HIDE TRAILS PASS IT THROUGH LEGAL JURISDICTIONS LIKE SWEDEN AND BELGIUM TO
JulianAssange_2010G@70.68:71.73 THOSE LEGAL PROTECTIONS
JulianAssange_2010G@74.22:76.18 THE MAIL THE REGULAR POSTAL
JulianAssange_2010G@78.35:81.83 OR NOT VET IT LIKE A REGULAR NEWS ORGANIZATION
JulianAssange_2010G@82.59:95.50 FORMAT IT WHICH IS SOMETIMES SOMETHING THAT'S QUITE HARD TO DO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GIANT DATABASES OF INFORMATION RELEASE IT TO THE PUBLIC AND THEN DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST THE INEVITABLE LEGAL AND
JulianAssange_2010G@97.06:105.43 SO YOU MAKE AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THE DOCUMENTS ARE LEGITIMATE BUT YOU ACTUALLY ALMOST NEVER KNOW WHO THE IDENTITY OF THE
JulianAssange_2010G@106.04:109.61 THAT'S RIGHT YEAH VERY RARELY DO WE EVER KNOW AND
JulianAssange_2010G@110.85:112.44 IF WE FIND OUT AT SOME STAGE
JulianAssange_2010G@123.04:125.85 ASKING WHAT THE CODE IS FOR A TED MEMBERSHIP
JulianAssange_2010G@128.42:139.38 SO LET 'S TAKE THE EXAMPLE ACTUALLY THIS IS SOMETHING YOU LEAKED A FEW YEARS AGO IF WE CAN HAVE THIS DOCUMENT UP SO THIS WAS A STORY IN KENYA A FEW YEARS AGO CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU
JulianAssange_2010G@142.08:147.66 SO THIS IS THE KROLL REPORT THIS WAS A SECRET INTELLIGENCE REPORT COMMISSIONED BY THE KENYAN GOVERNMENT
JulianAssange_2010G@149.13:159.91 ITS ELECTION IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR KENYA WAS RULED BY DANIEL ARAP MOI FOR ABOUT EIGHTEEN YEARS HE WAS A SOFT DICTATOR OF KENYA
JulianAssange_2010G@160.32:168.75 AND WHEN KIBAKI GOT INTO POWER THROUGH A COALITION OF FORCES THAT WERE TRYING TO CLEAN UP CORRUPTION IN KENYA THEY COMMISSIONED THIS REPORT SPENT ABOUT TWO
JulianAssange_2010G@169.18:179.14 MILLION POUNDS ON THIS AND AN ASSOCIATED REPORT AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT SAT ON IT AND USED IT FOR POLITICAL LEVERAGE ON MOI WHO WAS THE RICHEST MAN
JulianAssange_2010G@180.24:181.80 IS THE RICHEST MAN IN KENYA
JulianAssange_2010G@182.50:185.14 IT'S THE HOLY GRAIL OF KENYAN JOURNALISM
JulianAssange_2010G@185.87:194.85 SO I WENT THERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND WE MANAGED TO GET HOLD OF THIS JUST PRIOR TO THE ELECTION THE NATIONAL ELECTION DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHT
JulianAssange_2010G@198.29:207.43 WE RELEASED THAT REPORT WE DID SO THREE DAYS AFTER THE NEW PRESIDENT KIBAKI HAD DECIDED TO PAL UP WITH THE MAN THAT HE WAS GOING TO CLEAN
JulianAssange_2010G@210.27:214.60 SO THIS REPORT THEN BECAME A DEAD ALBATROSS AROUND
JulianAssange_2010G@218.69:230.07 AND I MEAN TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT WORD OF THE REPORT LEAKED INTO KENYA NOT FROM THE OFFICIAL MEDIA BUT INDIRECTLY AND IN YOUR OPINION IT ACTUALLY SHIFTED THE ELECTION
JulianAssange_2010G@230.84:237.24 THIS BECAME FRONT PAGE OF THE GUARDIAN AND WAS THEN PRINTED IN ALL THE SURROUNDING COUNTRIES OF KENYA IN
JulianAssange_2010G@256.32:259.84 SO YOUR LEAK REALLY SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGED THE WORLD
JulianAssange_2010G@265.01:265.36 'S

JulianAssange_2010G@337.46:342.72 WE ENDED UP SENDING TWO PEOPLE TO BAGHDAD TO FURTHER RESEARCH THAT STORY SO THIS IS JUST THE FIRST
JulianAssange_2010G@343.76:345.76 THREE ATTACKS THAT OCCURRED IN THAT
JulianAssange_2010G@346.36:350.79 ELEVEN PEOPLE DIED IN THAT ATTACK RIGHT INCLUDING TWO REUTERS EMPLOYEES
JulianAssange_2010G@355.37:357.57 THERE WERE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY SIX PEOPLE
JulianAssange_2010G@358.98:366.58 AND RELEASING THIS CAUSED WIDESPREAD OUTRAGE WHAT WAS THE KEY ELEMENT OF THIS THAT ACTUALLY CAUSED THE OUTRAGE DO
JulianAssange_2010G@369.32:374.95 CAN SEE THE GROSS DISPARITY IN FORCE YOU HAVE GUYS WALKING IN A RELAXED WAY DOWN THE STREET AND
JulianAssange_2010G@384.52:391.39 AND KILLING PEOPLE RESCUING THE WOUNDED AND THERE WAS TWO JOURNALISTS INVOLVED THAT CLEARLY WEREN'T INSURGENTS BECAUSE THAT'S THEIR FULL TIME JOB
JulianAssange_2010G@393.44:401.77 I MEAN THERE'S BEEN THIS U S INTELLIGENCE ANALYST BRADLEY MANNING ARRESTED AND IT'S ALLEGED THAT HE CONFESSED IN A CHAT ROOM TO HAVE LEAKED
JulianAssange_2010G@411.33:416.14 WE HAVE DENIED RECEIVING THOSE CABLES HE HAS BEEN CHARGED ABOUT FIVE DAYS AGO
JulianAssange_2010G@418.55:423.79 OBTAINING ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CABLES AND RELEASING FIFTY NOW WE HAD RELEASED
JulianAssange_2010G@425.69:428.25 EARLY IN THE YEAR A CABLE FROM
JulianAssange_2010G@428.72:435.17 THE REYKJAVIK U S EMBASSY BUT THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY CONNECTED I MEAN I WAS A KNOWN VISITOR
JulianAssange_2010G@440.49:441.85 WE WOULD HAVE RELEASED THEM CA YOU
JulianAssange_2010G@444.45:444.67 BECAUSE
JulianAssange_2010G@445.76:450.35 WELL BECAUSE THESE SORT OF THINGS REVEAL WHAT THE TRUE STATE
JulianAssange_2010G@453.02:461.08 SAY ARAB GOVERNMENTS ARE LIKE THE TRUE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN THOSE GOVERNMENTS IF YOU LOOK AT DECLASSIFIED CABLES THAT'S THE SORT OF
JulianAssange_2010G@462.30:470.14 SO LET 'S TALK A LITTLE MORE BROADLY ABOUT THIS I MEAN IN GENERAL WHAT'S YOUR PHILOSOPHY WHY IS IT RIGHT TO ENCOURAGE LEAKING OF SECRET INFORMATION
JulianAssange_2010G@471.26:477.59 WELL THERE'S A QUESTION AS TO WHAT SORT OF INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT IN THE WORLD WHAT SORT OF INFORMATION CAN ACHIEVE REFORM
JulianAssange_2010G@480.05:485.32 SO INFORMATION THAT ORGANIZATIONS ARE SPENDING ECONOMIC EFFORT INTO CONCEALING
JulianAssange_2010G@486.23:487.40 THAT'S A REALLY GOOD SIGNAL
JulianAssange_2010G@488.09:491.24 THAT WHEN THE INFORMATION GETS OUT THERE'S A HOPE OF IT DOING SOME GOOD
JulianAssange_2010G@491.91:496.39 BECAUSE THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT KNOW IT BEST THAT KNOW IT FROM THE INSIDE OUT ARE SPENDING WORK
JulianAssange_2010G@504.65:514.69 ARE THERE RISKS WITH THAT EITHER TO THE INDIVIDUALS CONCERNED OR INDEED TO SOCIETY AT LARGE WHERE LEAKING CAN ACTUALLY HAVE AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE
JulianAssange_2010G@530.74:533.23 YOUR RECORDS WITH YOUR DOCTOR THAT'S A LEGITIMATE SECRET
JulianAssange_2010G@534.52:538.58 WE DEAL WITH WHISTLEBLOWERS THAT ARE COMING FORWARD THAT ARE REALLY SORT OF WELL MOTIVATED
JulianAssange_2010G@539.88:550.52 SO THEY ARE WELL MOTIVATED AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO FOR EXAMPLE THE YOU KNOW THE PARENT OF SOMEONE WHOSE SON IS OUT SERVING THE U S MILITARY AND HE SAYS YOU KNOW
JulianAssange_2010G@551.53:557.20 PUT UP SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE HAD AN INCENTIVE TO PUT OUT IT SHOWS A U S SOLDIER LAUGHING AT PEOPLE DYING
JulianAssange_2010G@557.93:566.57 THAT GIVES THE IMPRESSION HAS GIVEN THE IMPRESSION TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD THAT U S SOLDIERS ARE INHUMAN PEOPLE ACTUALLY THEY'RE NOT MY SON ISN 'T HOW DARE YOU WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
JulianAssange_2010G@567.36:572.26 WE DO GET A LOT OF THAT BUT REMEMBER THE PEOPLE IN BAGHDAD THE PEOPLE
JulianAssange_2010G@574.78:576.05 DON'T NEED TO SEE THE VIDEO
JulianAssange_2010G@576.92:582.34 THEY SEE IT EVERY DAY SO IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE THEIR OPINION IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE THEIR PERCEPTION THAT'S WHAT
JulianAssange_2010G@593.13:602.99 FOUND A WAY TO SHINE LIGHT INTO WHAT YOU SEE AS THESE SORT OF DARK SECRETS IN COMPANIES AND IN GOVERNMENT LIGHT IS GOOD
JulianAssange_2010G@605.10:612.02 ANY IRONY IN THE FACT THAT IN ORDER FOR YOU TO SHINE THAT LIGHT YOU HAVE TO YOURSELF CREATE SECRECY AROUND YOUR SOURCES
JulianAssange_2010G@613.17:617.30 NOT REALLY I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE ANY WIKILEAKS DISSIDENTS YET
JulianAssange_2010G@619.40:622.09 HAVE SOURCES WHO ARE DISSIDENTS ON OTHER SOURCES
JulianAssange_2010G@627.81:635.27 WE'RE PRESUMABLY ACTING IN SUCH A WAY THAT PEOPLE FEEL MORALLY COMPELLED TO CONTINUE OUR MISSION NOT TO
JulianAssange_2010G@639.08:649.95 JUST BASED ON WHAT WE'VE HEARD SO FAR I'M CURIOUS AS TO THE OPINION IN THE TED AUDIENCE YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT BE A COUPLE OF VIEWS OF WIKILEAKS AND OF JULIAN YOU KNOW
JulianAssange_2010G@651.30:656.40 HERO PEOPLE 'S HERO BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT LIGHT DANGEROUS TROUBLEMAKER
JulianAssange_2010G@676.83:683.96 BUT I THINK FOR TED YOU ARE I MEAN IT'S AN INTRIGUING STORY THAT'S JUST HAPPENED RIGHT WHAT IS THIS JA SO THIS IS
JulianAssange_2010G@684.31:693.39 A SAMPLE OF WHAT WE DO SORT OF EVERY DAY SO LATE LAST YEAR IN NOVEMBER LAST YEAR THERE WAS A SERIES OF WELL BLOWOUTS IN ALBANIA

JulianAssange_2010G@829.06:838.05 GROWTH AND THAT MEANS WE'RE GETTING ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF WHISTLEBLOWER DISCLOSURES OF A VERY HIGH CALIBER BUT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY
JulianAssange_2010G@839.87:846.37 SO THAT'S THE KEY BOTTLENECK BASICALLY JOURNALISTIC VOLUNTEERS AND OR THE FUNDING OF JOURNALISTIC SALARIES
JulianAssange_2010G@846.77:857.09 YEAH AND TRUSTED PEOPLE I MEAN WE'RE AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS HARD TO GROW VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE OF THE SORT OF MATERIAL WE DEAL WITH SO WE HAVE TO RESTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO
