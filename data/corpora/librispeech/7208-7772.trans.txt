7208-7772-0000 WHICH NOT ONLY GAVE ME MUCH NEW EXPERIENCE BUT ENABLED ME TO SCATTER MY POLITICAL OPINIONS RATHER WIDELY AND BY MAKING ME KNOWN IN MANY QUARTERS WHERE I HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN HEARD OF
7208-7772-0001 INCREASED THE NUMBER OF MY READERS AND THE PRESUMABLE INFLUENCE OF MY WRITINGS THESE LATTER EFFECTS WERE OF COURSE PRODUCED IN A STILL GREATER DEGREE WHEN
7208-7772-0002 I WAS RETURNED TO PARLIAMENT BY A MAJORITY OF SOME HUNDREDS OVER MY CONSERVATIVE COMPETITOR I WAS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE DURING THE THREE SESSIONS OF THE PARLIAMENT WHICH PASSED THE REFORM BILL
7208-7772-0003 DURING WHICH TIME PARLIAMENT WAS NECESSARILY MY MAIN OCCUPATION EXCEPT DURING THE RECESS I WAS A TOLERABLY FREQUENT SPEAKER SOMETIMES OF PREPARED SPEECHES
7208-7772-0004 SOMETIMES EXTEMPORANEOUSLY BUT MY CHOICE OF OCCASIONS WAS NOT SUCH AS I SHOULD HAVE MADE IF MY LEADING OBJECT HAD BEEN PARLIAMENTARY INFLUENCE WHEN I HAD GAINED THE EAR OF THE HOUSE
7208-7772-0005 OR SUFFICIENTLY WELL DONE BY OTHER PEOPLE THERE WAS NO NECESSITY FOR ME TO MEDDLE WITH IT AS I THEREFORE IN GENERAL
7208-7772-0006 RESERVED MYSELF FOR WORK WHICH NO OTHERS WERE LIKELY TO DO A GREAT PROPORTION OF MY APPEARANCES WERE ON POINTS ON WHICH THE BULK OF THE LIBERAL PARTY EVEN THE ADVANCED PORTION OF IT
7208-7772-0007 REGARDED AS THE ADVANCED LIBERAL OPINION MY ADVOCACY OF WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE AND OF PERSONAL REPRESENTATION
7208-7772-0008 LOOKED UPON BY MANY AS WHIMS OF MY OWN BUT THE GREAT PROGRESS SINCE MADE BY THOSE OPINIONS
7208-7772-0009 FULLY JUSTIFIED THE TIMELINESS OF THOSE MOVEMENTS AND HAVE MADE WHAT WAS UNDERTAKEN AS A MORAL AND SOCIAL DUTY A PERSONAL SUCCESS ANOTHER DUTY WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY INCUMBENT ON ME
7208-7772-0010 AS ONE OF THE METROPOLITAN MEMBERS WAS THE ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN A MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE METROPOLIS BUT ON THAT SUBJECT THE INDIFFERENCE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
7208-7772-0011 MY PART WAS TO BRING IN BILLS ALREADY PREPARED AND TO SUSTAIN THE DISCUSSION OF THEM
7208-7772-0012 AFTER HAVING TAKEN AN ACTIVE PART IN THE WORK OF A COMMITTEE
7208-7772-0013 MAY JUSTLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE PREPARATION WHICH WENT ON DURING THOSE YEARS AND WHICH PRODUCED BUT LITTLE VISIBLE EFFECT AT THE TIME BUT ALL QUESTIONS ON WHICH THERE ARE STRONG PRIVATE INTERESTS
7208-7772-0014 ON ONE SIDE AND ONLY THE PUBLIC GOOD ON THE OTHER HAVE A SIMILAR PERIOD OF INCUBATION TO GO THROUGH THE SAME IDEA THAT THE USE OF MY BEING IN PARLIAMENT WAS TO DO WORK WHICH OTHERS WERE NOT ABLE
7208-7772-0015 OR NOT WILLING TO DO MADE ME THINK IT MY DUTY TO COME TO THE FRONT IN DEFENCE OF ADVANCED LIBERALISM ON OCCASIONS WHEN THE OBLOQUY TO BE ENCOUNTERED WAS SUCH AS
7208-7772-0016 AND FOR WHICH ONLY FIVE ENGLISH AND SCOTCH VOTES WERE GIVEN INCLUDING MY OWN THE OTHER FOUR WERE MISTER BRIGHT MISTER MC LAREN MISTER T B POTTER AND MISTER HADFIELD
7208-7772-0017 IN DENOUNCING ON THIS OCCASION THE ENGLISH MODE OF GOVERNING IRELAND I DID NO MORE THAN THE GENERAL OPINION OF ENGLAND NOW ADMITS TO HAVE BEEN JUST BUT THE ANGER AGAINST FENIANISM
7208-7772-0018 WAS THEN IN ALL ITS FRESHNESS ANY ATTACK ON WHAT FENIANS ATTACKED WAS LOOKED UPON AS AN APOLOGY FOR THEM AND I WAS SO UNFAVOURABLY RECEIVED BY THE HOUSE
7208-7772-0019 HAVE HELPED TO MAKE MY SPEECH ON THE REFORM BILL THE SUCCESS IT WAS MY POSITION IN THE HOUSE WAS FURTHER IMPROVED BY A SPEECH IN WHICH I INSISTED ON THE DUTY
7208-7772-0020 OF PAYING OFF THE NATIONAL DEBT BEFORE OUR COAL SUPPLIES ARE EXHAUSTED AND BY AN IRONICAL REPLY TO SOME OF THE TORY LEADERS WHO HAD QUOTED AGAINST ME CERTAIN PASSAGES OF MY WRITINGS
7208-7772-0021 AND CALLED ME TO ACCOUNT FOR OTHERS ESPECIALLY FOR ONE IN MY CONSIDERATIONS ON REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT WHICH SAID THAT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WAS BY THE LAW OF ITS COMPOSITION
7208-7772-0022 THE STUPIDEST PARTY THEY GAINED NOTHING BY DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE PASSAGE WHICH UP TO THAT TIME HAD NOT EXCITED ANY NOTICE
7208-7772-0023 MUCH SATISFACTION IN LOOKING BACK TO THE PART I TOOK ON THE TWO CLASSES OF SUBJECTS JUST MENTIONED WITH REGARD TO THE WORKING CLASSES THE CHIEF TOPIC OF MY SPEECH ON MISTER GLADSTONE'S REFORM BILL
7208-7772-0024 CAME THE ATTEMPT OF THE WORKING CLASSES TO HOLD A MEETING IN HYDE PARK THEIR EXCLUSION BY THE POLICE AND THE BREAKING DOWN OF THE PARK RAILING BY THE CROWD
7208-7772-0025 THEY SHOWED A DETERMINATION TO MAKE ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT A MEETING IN THE PARK TO WHICH MANY OF THEM WOULD PROBABLY HAVE COME ARMED THE GOVERNMENT MADE MILITARY PREPARATIONS TO RESIST THE ATTEMPT
7208-7772-0026 AND THE TASK FELL CHIEFLY UPON MYSELF OF PERSUADING THEM TO GIVE UP THE HYDE PARK PROJECT AND HOLD THEIR MEETING ELSEWHERE IT WAS NOT MISTER BEALES
7208-7772-0027 IT WAS THE WORKING MEN WHO HELD OUT AND SO BENT WERE THEY ON THEIR ORIGINAL SCHEME THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO LES GRANDS MOYENS
7208-7772-0028 TOLD THEM THAT A PROCEEDING WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY PRODUCE A COLLISION WITH THE MILITARY COULD ONLY BE JUSTIFIABLE ON TWO CONDITIONS IF THE POSITION OF AFFAIRS HAD BECOME SUCH THAT A REVOLUTION WAS DESIRABLE
7208-7772-0029 AND I COULD NOT CONSENT TO HOIST THE FLAG OF MANHOOD SUFFRAGE EVEN ON THE ASSURANCE THAT THE EXCLUSION OF WOMEN WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE IMPLIED SINCE IF ONE GOES BEYOND WHAT CAN BE IMMEDIATELY CARRIED
7208-7772-0030 AND PROFESSES TO TAKE ONE'S STAND ON A PRINCIPLE ONE SHOULD GO THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE PRINCIPLE I HAVE ENTERED THUS PARTICULARLY INTO THIS MATTER BECAUSE MY CONDUCT ON THIS OCCASION
7208-7772-0031 GAVE GREAT DISPLEASURE TO THE TORY AND TORY LIBERAL PRESS WHO HAVE CHARGED ME EVER SINCE WITH HAVING SHOWN MYSELF IN THE TRIALS OF PUBLIC LIFE INTEMPERATE AND PASSIONATE
7208-7772-0032 AIDED BY THE VERY LATE PERIOD OF THE SESSION SUCCEEDED IN DEFEATING THE BILL BY WHAT IS CALLED TALKING IT OUT IT HAS NOT SINCE BEEN RENEWED
7208-7772-0033 THE CHURCH QUESTION WAS SO VIGOROUSLY HANDLED BY THE LEADERS OF THE PARTY IN THE SESSION OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT AS TO REQUIRE NO MORE FROM ME THAN AN EMPHATIC ADHESION
7208-7772-0034 AND THE BACKWARD STATE OF THE QUESTION SO FAR AS CONCERNED THE PARLIAMENTARY MIND
7208-7772-0035 WHICH NEVERTHELESS COULD NOT BE CARRIED ON THAT BILL I DELIVERED ONE OF MY MOST CAREFUL SPEECHES IN WHICH I ATTEMPTED TO LAY DOWN SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SUBJECT
7208-7772-0036 IN A MANNER CALCULATED LESS TO STIMULATE FRIENDS THAN TO CONCILIATE AND CONVINCE OPPONENTS THE ENGROSSING SUBJECT OF PARLIAMENTARY REFORM
7208-7772-0037 FROM BEING CARRIED THROUGH THEY NEVER GOT BEYOND THE SECOND READING MEANWHILE THE SIGNS OF IRISH DISAFFECTION HAD BECOME MUCH MORE DECIDED
7208-7772-0038 IT COULD ONLY BE BY THE ADOPTION OF MUCH MORE THOROUGH REFORMS IN THE TERRITORIAL AND SOCIAL RELATIONS OF THE COUNTRY
7208-7772-0039 WHICH WAS WRITTEN IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN AND PUBLISHED SHORTLY BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SESSION OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT THE LEADING FEATURES OF THE PAMPHLET WERE
7208-7772-0040 A PROPOSAL FOR SETTLING THE LAND QUESTION BY GIVING TO THE EXISTING TENANTS A PERMANENT TENURE AT A FIXED RENT TO BE ASSESSED AFTER DUE INQUIRY BY THE STATE THE PAMPHLET WAS NOT POPULAR
7208-7772-0041 THE DUTY OF PROPOSING IT WAS IMPERATIVE WHILE IF ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WAS ANY INTERMEDIATE COURSE WHICH HAD A CLAIM TO A TRIAL
7208-7772-0042 THAT TO PROPOSE SOMETHING WHICH WOULD BE CALLED EXTREME WAS THE TRUE WAY NOT TO IMPEDE BUT TO FACILITATE A MORE MODERATE EXPERIMENT IT IS MOST IMPROBABLE
7208-7772-0043 TENANTRY AS MISTER GLADSTONE'S IRISH LAND BILL WOULD HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY A GOVERNMENT OR COULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED THROUGH PARLIAMENT UNLESS THE BRITISH PUBLIC HAD BEEN LED TO PERCEIVE THAT A CASE MIGHT BE MADE
7208-7772-0044 AND PERHAPS A PARTY FORMED FOR A MEASURE CONSIDERABLY STRONGER IT IS THE CHARACTER OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE OR AT LEAST OF THE HIGHER AND MIDDLE CLASSES WHO PASS MUSTER FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE THAT TO
7208-7772-0045 GOING STILL FARTHER UPON WHICH THEIR ANTIPATHY TO EXTREME VIEWS MAY DISCHARGE ITSELF SO IT PROVED IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE MY PROPOSAL WAS CONDEMNED
7208-7772-0046 IF HE LIKED BETTER TO SELL HIS ESTATE THAN TO RETAIN IT ON THE NEW CONDITIONS AND I FULLY ANTICIPATED THAT MOST LANDLORDS WOULD CONTINUE TO PREFER THE POSITION OF LANDOWNERS TO THAT OF GOVERNMENT ANNUITANTS
7208-7772-0047 TOGETHER WITH MY SPEECH ON MISTER FORTESCUE'S BILL
7208-7772-0048 IN IRELAND ANOTHER PUBLIC DUTY OF A MOST SERIOUS KIND IT WAS MY LOT TO HAVE TO PERFORM BOTH IN AND OUT OF PARLIAMENT DURING THESE YEARS A DISTURBANCE IN JAMAICA
7208-7772-0049 PROVOKED IN THE FIRST INSTANCE BY INJUSTICE AND EXAGGERATED BY RAGE AND PANIC
7208-7772-0050 WHEN PERPETRATED BY THE INSTRUMENTS OF OTHER GOVERNMENTS ENGLISHMEN CAN HARDLY FIND TERMS SUFFICIENT TO EXPRESS THEIR ABHORRENCE AFTER A SHORT TIME HOWEVER AN INDIGNANT FEELING WAS ROUSED
7208-7772-0051 TAKE SUCH DELIBERATION AND ACTION AS THE CASE MIGHT ADMIT OF AND ADHESIONS POURED IN FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY I WAS ABROAD AT THE TIME BUT I SENT IN MY NAME TO THE COMMITTEE AS SOON AS I HEARD OF IT
7208-7772-0052 AND TOOK AN ACTIVE PART IN THE PROCEEDINGS FROM THE TIME OF MY RETURN THERE WAS MUCH MORE AT STAKE THAN ONLY JUSTICE TO THE NEGROES IMPERATIVE AS WAS THAT CONSIDERATION
7208-7772-0053 WHETHER THE LIVES AND PERSONS OF BRITISH SUBJECTS ARE AT THE MERCY OF ANY TWO OR THREE OFFICERS HOWEVER RAW AND INEXPERIENCED OR RECKLESS AND BRUTAL WHOM A PANIC STRICKEN GOVERNOR
7208-7772-0054 AND SUCH AN APPEAL THE COMMITTEE DETERMINED TO MAKE THEIR DETERMINATION LED TO A CHANGE IN THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE COMMITTEE AS THE CHAIRMAN MISTER CHARLES BUXTON THOUGHT IT NOT UNJUST INDEED
7208-7772-0055 AND HIS PRINCIPAL SUBORDINATES IN A CRIMINAL COURT BUT A NUMEROUSLY ATTENDED GENERAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION HAVING DECIDED THIS POINT AGAINST HIM MISTER BUXTON WITHDREW FROM THE COMMITTEE
7208-7772-0056 MY DUTY TO REPRESENT THE COMMITTEE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS SOMETIMES BY PUTTING QUESTIONS TO THE GOVERNMENT
7208-7772-0057 MORE OR LESS PROVOCATIVE ADDRESSED BY INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS TO MYSELF BUT ESPECIALLY AS SPEAKER IN THE IMPORTANT DEBATE ORIGINATED IN THE SESSION OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX BY MISTER BUXTON
7208-7772-0058 TRYING EVERY AVENUE LEGALLY OPEN TO US TO THE COURTS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE A BENCH OF MAGISTRATES IN ONE OF THE MOST TORY COUNTIES IN ENGLAND DISMISSED OUR CASE
7208-7772-0059 WE WERE MORE SUCCESSFUL BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES AT BOW STREET WHICH GAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE QUEEN'S BENCH SIR ALEXANDER COCKBURN FOR DELIVERING HIS CELEBRATED CHARGE
7208-7772-0060 WHICH SETTLED THE LAW OF THE QUESTION IN FAVOUR OF LIBERTY AS FAR AS IT IS IN THE POWER OF A JUDGE'S CHARGE TO SETTLE IT THERE HOWEVER OUR SUCCESS ENDED FOR THE OLD BAILEY GRAND JURY
7208-7772-0061 WE HAD ELICITED FROM THE HIGHEST CRIMINAL JUDGE IN THE NATION AN AUTHORITATIVE DECLARATION THAT THE LAW WAS WHAT WE MAINTAINED IT TO BE
