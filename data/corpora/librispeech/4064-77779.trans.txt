4064-77779-0000 YOU THINK THAT DO YOU OBSERVED THE BIBLIOMANIAC WELL I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU I FOR ONE AM SICK AND TIRED OF POLITICS AND IT WILL BE A GREAT RELIEF TO ME WHEN IT IS ALL OVER
4064-77779-0001 RETURNED THE IDIOT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN DOES NOT KEEP YOUR NERVE CENTRES IN A CONSTANT STATE OF PLEASURABLE TITILLATION WHY TO ME IT IS WHAT A BAG FULL OF NUTS MUST BE TO A SQUIRREL
4064-77779-0002 I FAIRLY GLOAT OVER THESE QUADRENNIAL POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS OF OURS THEY ARE TO ME AMONG THE MOST EXHILARATING INSTITUTIONS OF MODERN LIFE THEY SATISFY ALL ONE'S ZEST FOR WARFARE
4064-77779-0003 WITHOUT THE DISTRESSING SHEDDING OF BLOOD WHICH ATTENDS REAL WAR AND REGARDED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF HUMOR I KNOW OF NOTHING THAT TO THE EYE OF AN ORDINARILY KEEN OBSERVER IS MORE PROVOCATIVE OF GOOD HONEST WHOLESOME MIRTH
4064-77779-0004 THAT MODERN CIVILIZATION SO CALLED HAS PRODUCED A COUPLE OF MEN ARE PUT UP FOR THE MOST DIGNIFIED OFFICE KNOWN TO THE WORLD BOTH ARE GENTLEMEN BY BIRTH AND EDUCATION MEN OF HONOR
4064-77779-0005 MEN WHO YOU WOULD THINK WOULD SCORN BASENESS AS THEY HATE POISON AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS FOR THREE WEARY MONTHS THE FOLLOWERS OF EACH ATTACK THE CHARACTER AND INTELLIGENCE OF THE OTHER
4064-77779-0006 WHEN A MAN WHO IS NOMINATED FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN JUNE OR JULY CAN EMERGE IN NOVEMBER UNSCATHED IN SPITE OF THE MINUTE SCRUTINY TO WHICH HIMSELF AND HIS RECORD AND THE RECORD OF HIS SISTERS AND HIS COUSINS
4064-77779-0007 WHO SPENT HIS LIFE LOOKING FOR AN HONEST MAN WOULD HAVE TO ADMIT EVERY FOUR YEARS THAT HE COULD SPOT HIM INSTANTLY BY MERELY COMING TO THIS COUNTRY AND TAKING HIS CHOICE FROM AMONG THE SEVERAL CANDIDATES
4064-77779-0008 YOU MUST ADMIT HOWEVER SAID THE BIBLIOMANIAC THAT A MAN WITH AN HONORABLE NAME MUST FIND IT UNPLEASANT TO HAVE SUCH OUTRAGEOUS STORIES TOLD OF HIM NOT A BIT OF IT LAUGHED THE IDIOT
4064-77779-0009 HE PUT OUT THE EYES OF A MAIDEN AUNT WITH A RED HOT POKER AND STABBED A NEGRO COOK IN THE BACK WITH A SKEWER BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT PERMIT HIM TO PUT RAT POISON IN HIS GRANDFATHER'S COFFEE
4064-77779-0010 YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT THAT STORY HAS BEEN PUT FORTH FOR THE PURPOSE OF TURNING THE MAIDEN AUNT NEGRO AND GRANDFATHER VOTES AGAINST HIM YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE EITHER NEVER DID WHAT IS CHARGED AGAINST HIM
4064-77779-0011 OR AT LEAST THAT THE STORY IS GREATLY EXAGGERATED HE MAY HAVE STUCK A PIN INTO THE COOK AND PLAYED SOME BOYISH TRICK UPON SOME OF HIS RELATIVES BUT THE STORY ON THE FACE OF IT IS UNTRUE AND THEREFORE HARMLESS
4064-77779-0012 SIMILARLY WITH THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE WHEN THE DAILY FLIM FLAM ASSERTS THAT HE BELIEVES THAT THE WORKING MAN IS ENTITLED TO FOUR CENTS A DAY FOR SIXTEEN HOURS WORK
4064-77779-0013 AND HAS REPEATEDLY AVOWED THAT BREAD AND WATER IS THE PROPER FOOD FOR MOTORMEN EVERYBODY WITH COMMON SENSE REALIZES AT ONCE THAT EVEN THE FLIM FLAM DOESN'T BELIEVE THE STORY IT HURTS NO ONE THEREFORE
4064-77779-0014 AND PROVOKES A GREAT DEAL OF INNOCENT MIRTH YOU DON'T YOURSELF BELIEVE THAT LAST YARN ABOUT THE PROHIBITION CANDIDATE DO YOU I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY YARN ABOUT HIM SAID THE BIBLIOMANIAC THAT HE IS THE OWNER OF A BREWERY UP IN ROCHESTER
4064-77779-0015 AND BACKS FIFTEEN SALOONS AND A POOL ROOM IN NEW YORK SAID THE IDIOT OF COURSE I DON'T SAID THE BIBLIOMANIAC WHO DOES NOBODY SAID THE IDIOT AND THEREFORE THE STORY DOESN'T HURT THE MAN'S REPUTATION A BIT
4064-77779-0016 OR INTERFERE WITH HIS CHANCES OF ELECTION IN THE LEAST TAKE THAT OTHER STORY PUBLISHED IN A NEW YORK NEWSPAPER THAT ON THE TENTH OF LAST AUGUST THOMPSON BONDIFELLER'S YACHT WAS SEEN ANCHORED FOR SIX HOURS OFF TOM WATSON'S FARM
4064-77779-0017 IT'S PREPOSTEROUS ON THE FACE OF IT SAID MISTER BIB WELL THAT'S THE WAY THE THING WORKS SAID THE IDIOT AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF BULLY GOOD FUN TO BE HAD OUT OF A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN
4064-77779-0018 UNIMAGINATIVE PEOPLE AND THAT WOULD BE DEATH TO PROGRESS NO PEOPLE CAN PROGRESS THAT LACKS IMAGINATION POLITICS IS AN EMERY WHEEL THAT KEEPS OUR WITS POLISHED WELL
4064-77779-0019 THAT'S THE STRANGEST ARGUMENT OF ALL HE SAID THE VERY IDEA OF A MAN WHO DELIBERATELY CHOOSES PUBLIC LIFE AS THE SPHERE OF HIS ACTIVITIES SEEKING TO HIDE BEHIND HIS PRIVATE LIFE IS PREPOSTEROUS
4064-77779-0020 THE FELLOW WHO DOES THAT MISTER BIB WANTS TO LEAD A DOUBLE LIFE AND THAT IS REPREHENSIBLE THE MAN WHO OFFERS HIMSELF TO THE PEOPLE HASN'T ANY BUSINESS TO TIE A STRING TO ANY PART OF HIM
4064-77779-0021 IF JIM JONES WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ASKED TO PUT HIM THERE
4064-77779-0022 OUGHT TO BE WARNED BEFOREHAND YOU WOULDN'T YOURSELF RENT A FURNISHED RESIDENCE TO A MAN WHOSE CHILDREN WERE KNOWN TO HAVE BUILT BONFIRES IN THE PARLOR OF THEIR LAST KNOWN HOME WOULD YOU I THINK NOT SMILED THE BIBLIOMANIAC
4064-77779-0023 THEN YOU CANNOT COMPLAIN IF UNCLE SAM IS EQUALLY SOLICITOUS ABOUT THE PERSONAL PARAPHERNALIA OF THE MAN WHO ASKS TO OCCUPY HIS LITTLE COTTAGE ON THE POTOMAC SAID THE IDIOT
4064-77779-0024 SO IT HAPPENS THAT WHEN A MAN RUNS FOR THE PRESIDENCY THE PERSONS WHO INTRUDE UPON HIS PRIVATE LIFE AS YOU PUT IT ARE CONFERRING A REAL SERVICE UPON THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS WHEN I HEAR FROM AN AUTHENTIC SOURCE THAT
4064-77779-0025 MISTER SO AND SO THE CANDIDATE OF THE THISORTHATIC PARTY FOR THE PRESIDENCY IS MARRIED TO AN ESTIMABLE LADY WHO REFERS TO ALL FRENCHMEN AS PARRICIDES BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES THEY HAVE COME FROM PARIS
4064-77779-0026 I HAVE A RIGHT TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT I WISH TO VOTE TO PLACE SUCH A LADY AT THE HEAD OF MY OFFICIAL TABLE AT WHITE HOUSE BANQUETS WHERE SHE IS LIKELY SOONER OR LATER TO ENCOUNTER THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR
4064-77779-0027 A MAN'S WIFE IS HIS BETTER HALF AND HIS CHILDREN ARE A GOOD PART OF THE REMAINDER AND WHAT THEY DO OR DON'T DO BECOMES A MATTER OF LEGITIMATE PUBLIC CONCERN AS A MATTER OF FACT A PUBLIC MAN
4064-77779-0028 CAN HAVE NO PRIVATE LIFE THEN YOU APPROVE OF THESE STORIES OF CANDIDATES COUSINS THE PRATTLING ANECDOTES OF THEIR GRANDCHILDREN THESE PARAGRAPHS NARRATING THE DOINGS OF THEIR UNCLES IN LAW AND ALL THAT SNEERED THE BIBLIOMANIAC
4064-77779-0029 CERTAINLY I DO SAID THE IDIOT WHEN I HEAR THAT JUDGE TORKIN'S GRANDSON AGED FOUR HAS COME OUT FOR HIS GRANDFATHER'S OPPONENT I AM DELIGHTED AND GIVE THE JUDGE CREDIT FOR THE INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WHICH HEREDITY ACCOUNTS FOR
4064-77779-0030 WHEN IT IS TOLD TO ME THAT TOM WATSON'S UNCLE IS GOING TO VOTE FOR TOM BECAUSE HE KNOWS TOM DOESN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE SAYS I AM ALMOST INCLINED TO VOTE FOR HIM AS THE UNCLE OF HIS COUNTRY WHEN I HEAR THAT DEBS'S SON AGED THREE
4064-77779-0031 I FEEL THAT POSSIBLY THERE IS A FAMILY AVERAGE THERE THAT MAY BE STRUCK TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE COUNTRY SAY MISTER IDIOT PUT IN THE POET AT THIS POINT WHO ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR ANYHOW
4064-77779-0032 DON'T ASK ME LAUGHED THE IDIOT I DON'T KNOW YET I ADMIRE ALL THE CANDIDATES PERSONALLY VERY MUCH BUT WHAT ARE YOUR POLITICS REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC ASKED THE LAWYER OH THAT'S DIFFERENT SAID THE IDIOT
