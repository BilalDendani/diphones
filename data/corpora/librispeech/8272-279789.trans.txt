8272-279789-0000 LITTLE SNOWDROP ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER WHEN THE FLAKES OF SNOW FELL LIKE FEATHERS FROM THE SKY A QUEEN SAT AT A WINDOW SET IN AN EBONY FRAME AND SEWED WHILE SHE WAS SEWING AND WATCHING THE SNOW FALL SHE PRICKED HER FINGER WITH HER NEEDLE
8272-279789-0001 OH THAT I HAD A CHILD AS WHITE AS SNOW AS RED AS BLOOD AND AS BLACK AS THE WOOD OF THIS EBONY FRAME SOON AFTERWARDS SHE HAD A LITTLE DAUGHTER WHO WAS AS WHITE AS SNOW AS RED AS BLOOD AND HAD HAIR AS BLACK AS EBONY
8272-279789-0002 AND WHEN THE CHILD WAS BORN THE QUEEN DIED AFTER A YEAR HAD GONE BY THE KING TOOK ANOTHER WIFE SHE WAS A HANDSOME LADY BUT PROUD AND HAUGHTY AND COULD NOT ENDURE THAT ANY ONE SHOULD SURPASS HER IN BEAUTY SHE HAD A WONDERFUL MIRROR
8272-279789-0003 AND WHENEVER SHE WALKED UP TO IT AND LOOKED AT HERSELF IN IT SHE SAID LITTLE GLASS UPON THE WALL
8272-279789-0004 THEN THE MIRROR REPLIED LADY QUEEN SO GRAND AND TALL THOU ART THE FAIREST OF THEM ALL AND SHE WAS SATISFIED FOR SHE KNEW THE MIRROR ALWAYS TOLD THE TRUTH BUT SNOWDROP GREW EVER TALLER AND FAIRER
8272-279789-0005 AND AT SEVEN YEARS OLD WAS BEAUTIFUL AS THE DAY AND MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE QUEEN HERSELF SO ONCE
8272-279789-0006 LITTLE GLASS UPON THE WALL WHO IS FAIREST AMONG US ALL IT ANSWERED LADY QUEEN YOU ARE GRAND AND TALL BUT SNOWDROP IS FAIREST OF YOU ALL THEN THE QUEEN WAS STARTLED AND TURNED YELLOW AND GREEN WITH ENVY
8272-279789-0007 FROM THAT HOUR SHE SO HATED SNOWDROP THAT SHE BURNED WITH SECRET WRATH WHENEVER SHE SAW THE MAIDEN PRIDE AND ENVY GREW APACE LIKE WEEDS IN HER HEART TILL SHE HAD NO REST DAY OR NIGHT SO SHE CALLED A HUNTSMAN AND SAID TAKE THE CHILD OUT IN THE FOREST
8272-279789-0008 FOR I WILL ENDURE HER NO LONGER IN MY SIGHT KILL HER AND BRING ME HER LUNGS AND LIVER AS TOKENS THAT YOU HAVE DONE IT THE HUNTSMAN OBEYED AND LED THE CHILD AWAY BUT WHEN HE HAD DRAWN HIS HUNTING KNIFE AND WAS ABOUT TO PIERCE SNOWDROP'S INNOCENT HEART SHE BEGAN TO WEEP AND SAID
8272-279789-0009 THE HUNTSMAN TOOK PITY ON HER BECAUSE SHE LOOKED SO LOVELY AND SAID RUN AWAY THEN POOR CHILD THE WILD BEASTS WILL SOON MAKE AN END OF THEE HE THOUGHT BUT IT SEEMED AS IF A STONE HAD BEEN ROLLED FROM HIS HEART BECAUSE HE HAD AVOIDED TAKING HER LIFE
8272-279789-0010 AND AS A LITTLE BEAR CAME BY JUST THEN HE KILLED IT TOOK OUT ITS LIVER AND LUNGS AND CARRIED THEM AS TOKENS TO THE QUEEN SHE MADE THE COOK DRESS THEM WITH SALT AND THEN THE WICKED WOMAN ATE THEM AND THOUGHT SHE HAD EATEN SNOWDROP'S LUNGS AND LIVER
8272-279789-0011 THE POOR CHILD WAS NOW ALL ALONE IN THE GREAT FOREST AND SHE FELT FRIGHTENED AS SHE LOOKED AT ALL THE LEAFY TREES AND KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO SO SHE BEGAN TO RUN
8272-279789-0012 AND THROUGH THE THORNS AND THE WILD BEASTS PASSED CLOSE TO HER BUT DID HER NO HARM SHE RAN AS LONG AS HER FEET COULD CARRY HER AND WHEN EVENING CLOSED IN SHE SAW A LITTLE HOUSE AND WENT INTO IT TO REST HERSELF EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE WAS VERY SMALL
8272-279789-0013 BUT I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW PRETTY AND CLEAN IT WAS THERE STOOD A LITTLE TABLE COVERED WITH A WHITE TABLECLOTH ON WHICH WERE SEVEN LITTLE PLATES EACH LITTLE PLATE WITH ITS OWN LITTLE SPOON ALSO SEVEN LITTLE KNIVES AND FORKS
8272-279789-0014 AND SEVEN LITTLE CUPS ROUND THE WALLS STOOD SEVEN LITTLE BEDS CLOSE TOGETHER
8272-279789-0015 SNOWDROP BEING SO HUNGRY AND THIRSTY ATE A LITTLE OF THE VEGETABLES AND BREAD ON EACH PLATE AND DRANK A DROP OF WINE FROM EVERY CUP FOR SHE DID NOT LIKE TO EMPTY ONE ENTIRELY THEN BEING VERY TIRED SHE LAID HERSELF DOWN IN ONE OF THE BEDS
