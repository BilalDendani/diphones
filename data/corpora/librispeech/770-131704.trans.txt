770-131704-0000 EDISON HIS LIFE AND INVENTIONS
770-131704-0001 BY THE RATIONAL COMPROMISE WITH ENGLAND IN THE DISPUTE OVER THE OREGON REGION PRESIDENT POLK HAD SECURED DURING EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX FOR UNDISTURBED SETTLEMENT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF FOREST FERTILE LAND AND FISHERIES
770-131704-0002 SOUTH OF OREGON AND WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS ADDED BY TREATY TO THE UNITED STATES THUS IN ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS THERE HAD BEEN PIECED INTO THE NATIONAL DOMAIN FOR QUICK DEVELOPMENT AND EXPLOITATION
770-131704-0003 A REGION AS LARGE AS THE ENTIRE UNION OF THIRTEEN STATES AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE MOREOVER WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES WAS EMBRACED ALL THE GREAT AMERICAN GOLD FIELD JUST ON THE EVE OF DISCOVERY FOR MARSHALL HAD DETECTED THE SHINING PARTICLES IN THE MILL RACE
770-131704-0004 AT THE FOOT OF THE SIERRA NEVADA NINE DAYS BEFORE MEXICO SIGNED AWAY HER RIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA AND IN ALL THE VAGUE REMOTE HINTERLAND FACING CATHAYWARD EQUALLY MOMENTOUS WERE THE TIMES IN EUROPE WHERE THE ATTEMPT TO SECURE OPPORTUNITIES OF EXPANSION
770-131704-0005 AS WELL AS LARGER LIBERTY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TOOK QUITE DIFFERENT FORM THE OLD ABSOLUTIST SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT WAS FAST BREAKING UP AND ANCIENT THRONES WERE TOTTERING THE RED LAVA OF DEEP REVOLUTIONARY FIRES OOZED UP THROUGH MANY GLOWING CRACKS IN THE POLITICAL CRUST
770-131704-0006 AND ALL THE SOCIAL STRATA WERE SHAKEN THAT THE WILD OUTBURSTS OF INSURRECTION MIDWAY IN THE FIFTH DECADE FAILED AND DIED AWAY WAS NOT SURPRISING FOR THE SUPERINCUMBENT DEPOSITS OF TRADITION AND CONVENTION WERE THICK
770-131704-0007 BUT THE RETROSPECT INDICATES THAT MANY REFORMS AND POLITICAL CHANGES WERE ACCOMPLISHED ALTHOUGH THE PROCESS INVOLVED THE EXILE OF NOT A FEW ARDENT SPIRITS TO AMERICA TO BECOME LEADING STATESMEN INVENTORS
770-131704-0008 IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN TOO RUSSIA BEGAN HER TREMENDOUS MARCH EASTWARD INTO CENTRAL ASIA JUST AS FRANCE WAS SOLIDIFYING HER FIRST GAINS ON THE LITTORAL OF NORTHERN AFRICA IN ENGLAND THE FIERCE FERVOR OF THE CHARTIST MOVEMENT
770-131704-0009 WITH ITS VIOLENT RHETORIC AS TO THE RIGHTS OF MAN WAS SOBERING DOWN AND PASSING PERVASIVELY INTO NUMEROUS PRACTICAL SCHEMES FOR SOCIAL AND POLITICAL AMELIORATION CONSTITUTING IN THEIR ENTIRETY A MOST PROFOUND CHANGE THROUGHOUT EVERY PART OF THE NATIONAL LIFE
770-131704-0010 INTO SUCH TIMES THOMAS ALVA EDISON WAS BORN AND HIS RELATIONS TO THEM AND TO THE EVENTS OF THE PAST SIXTY YEARS ARE THE SUBJECT OF THIS NARRATIVE ASIDE FROM THE PERSONAL INTEREST THAT ATTACHES TO THE PICTURESQUE CAREER SO TYPICALLY AMERICAN
770-131704-0011 THERE IS A BROADER ASPECT IN WHICH THE WORK OF THE FRANKLIN OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY TOUCHES THE WELFARE AND PROGRESS OF THE RACE IT IS DIFFICULT AT ANY TIME TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF ANY SINGLE INVENTION AND THE INVESTIGATION BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT
770-131704-0012 WHERE INVENTIONS OF THE FIRST CLASS HAVE BEEN CROWDED UPON EACH OTHER IN RAPID AND BEWILDERING SUCCESSION BUT IT WILL BE ADMITTED THAT IN EDISON ONE DEALS WITH A CENTRAL FIGURE OF THE GREAT AGE THAT SAW THE INVENTION AND INTRODUCTION IN PRACTICAL FORM OF THE TELEGRAPH
770-131704-0013 THE SUBMARINE CABLE THE TELEPHONE THE ELECTRIC LIGHT THE ELECTRIC RAILWAY THE ELECTRIC TROLLEY CAR THE STORAGE BATTERY THE ELECTRIC MOTOR THE PHONOGRAPH THE WIRELESS TELEGRAPH
770-131704-0014 AND THAT THE INFLUENCE OF THESE ON THE WORLD'S AFFAIRS HAS NOT BEEN EXCELLED AT ANY TIME BY THAT OF ANY OTHER CORRESPONDING ADVANCES IN THE ARTS AND SCIENCES THESE PAGES DEAL WITH EDISON'S SHARE IN THE GREAT WORK OF THE LAST HALF CENTURY
770-131704-0015 IN ABRIDGING DISTANCE COMMUNICATING INTELLIGENCE LESSENING TOIL IMPROVING ILLUMINATION RECORDING FOREVER THE HUMAN VOICE AND ON BEHALF OF INVENTIVE GENIUS IT MAY BE URGED
770-131704-0016 AND THE REVOLVER GUNCOTTON AND NITROGLYCERINE ADDED TO THE AGENCIES FOR SLAUGHTER NEW METALS CHEMICALS AND ELEMENTS HAD BECOME AVAILABLE IN LARGE NUMBERS GASES HAD BEEN LIQUEFIED AND SOLIDIFIED
770-131704-0017 AND THE RANGE OF USEFUL HEAT AND COLD INDEFINITELY EXTENDED THE SAFETY LAMP HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THE MINER THE CAISSON TO THE BRIDGE BUILDER THE ANTI FRICTION METAL TO THE MECHANIC FOR BEARINGS IT WAS ALREADY KNOWN HOW TO VULCANIZE RUBBER
770-131704-0018 THE GIGANTIC EXPANSION OF THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY WAS FORESHADOWED IN THE CHANGE FROM WOOD TO COAL IN THE SMELTING FURNACES THE SEWING MACHINE HAD BROUGHT WITH IT LIKE THE FRICTION MATCH ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND INFLUENCES IN MODIFYING DOMESTIC LIFE
770-131704-0019 AND MAKING IT DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF ALL PRECEDING TIME EVEN IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN FEW OF THESE THINGS HAD LOST THEIR NOVELTY MOST OF THEM WERE IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT BUT IT IS WHEN WE TURN TO ELECTRICITY
770-131704-0020 THAT THE RICH VIRGIN CONDITION OF AN ILLIMITABLE NEW KINGDOM OF DISCOVERY IS SEEN PERHAPS THE WORD UTILIZATION OR APPLICATION IS BETTER THAN DISCOVERY
770-131704-0021 FOR THEN AS NOW AN ENDLESS WEALTH OF PHENOMENA NOTED BY EXPERIMENTERS FROM GILBERT TO FRANKLIN AND FARADAY AWAITED THE INVENTION THAT COULD ALONE RENDER THEM USEFUL TO MANKIND THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
770-131704-0022 KEENLY CURIOUS AND CEASELESSLY ACTIVE IN THIS FASCINATING FIELD OF INVESTIGATION HAD NOT AFTER ALL LEFT MUCH OF A LEGACY IN EITHER PRINCIPLES OR APPLIANCES THE LODESTONE AND THE COMPASS THE FRICTIONAL MACHINE THE LEYDEN JAR
770-131704-0023 THE NATURE OF CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS THE IDENTITY OF ELECTRICITY AND THE THUNDER STORM FLASH THE USE OF LIGHTNING RODS THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF AN ELECTRICAL SHOCK THESE CONSTITUTED THE BULK OF THE BEQUEST
770-131704-0024 TO WHICH PHILOSOPHERS WERE THE ONLY HEIRS PREGNANT WITH POSSIBILITIES WERE MANY OF THE OBSERVATIONS THAT HAD BEEN RECORDED BUT THESE FEW APPLIANCES MADE UP THE MEAGRE KIT OF TOOLS WITH WHICH THE NINETEENTH CENTURY ENTERED UPON ITS TASK OF ACQUIRING THE ARTS AND CONVENIENCES
770-131704-0025 NOW SUCH AN INTIMATE PART OF HUMAN NATURE'S DAILY FOOD THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN TO DAY PAYS MORE FOR HIS ELECTRICAL SERVICE THAN HE DOES FOR BREAD WITH THE FIRST YEAR OF THE NEW CENTURY CAME VOLTA'S INVENTION OF THE CHEMICAL BATTERY
770-131704-0026 AS A MEANS OF PRODUCING ELECTRICITY A WELL KNOWN ITALIAN PICTURE REPRESENTS VOLTA EXHIBITING HIS APPARATUS BEFORE THE YOUNG CONQUEROR NAPOLEON THEN RAVISHING FROM THE PENINSULA ITS TREASURE OF ANCIENT ART AND FOUNDING AN EPHEMERAL EMPIRE
770-131704-0027 AT SUCH A MOMENT THIS GIFT OF DESPOILED ITALY TO THE WORLD WAS A NOBLE REVENGE SETTING IN MOTION INCALCULABLE BENEFICENT FORCES AND AGENCIES FOR THE FIRST TIME MAN HAD COMMAND OF A STEADY SUPPLY OF ELECTRICITY WITHOUT TOIL OR EFFORT
770-131704-0028 WERE NOT MUCH GREATER THAN THOSE TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FLIGHT OF A ROCKET WHILE THE FRICTIONAL APPLIANCE IS STILL EMPLOYED IN MEDICINE IT RANKS WITH THE FLINT AXE AND THE TINDER BOX IN INDUSTRIAL OBSOLESCENCE NO ART OR TRADE COULD BE FOUNDED ON IT
770-131704-0029 NO DIMINUTION OF DAILY WORK OR INCREASE OF DAILY COMFORT COULD BE SECURED WITH IT BUT THE LITTLE BATTERY WITH ITS METAL PLATES IN A WEAK SOLUTION PROVED A PERENNIAL RESERVOIR OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY SAFE AND CONTROLLABLE
770-131704-0030 AND WHILE THE MORE EXTENSIVE OF THEM DEPEND TO DAY ON THE DYNAMO FOR ELECTRICAL ENERGY SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STILL REMAIN IN LOYAL ALLEGIANCE TO THE OLDER SOURCE THE BATTERY ITSELF SOON UNDERWENT MODIFICATIONS AND NEW TYPES WERE EVOLVED THE STORAGE
770-131704-0031 THE DOUBLE FLUID AND THE DRY VARIOUS ANALOGIES NEXT POINTED TO THE USE OF HEAT AND THE THERMOELECTRIC CELL EMERGED EMBODYING THE APPLICATION OF FLAME TO THE JUNCTION OF TWO DIFFERENT METALS DAVY OF THE SAFETY LAMP
770-131704-0032 THREW A VOLUME OF CURRENT ACROSS THE GAP BETWEEN TWO STICKS OF CHARCOAL AND THE VOLTAIC ARC
770-131704-0033 SHED ITS BRIGHT BEAMS UPON A DAZZLED WORLD THE DECOMPOSITION OF WATER BY ELECTROLYTIC ACTION WAS RECOGNIZED AND MADE THE BASIS OF COMMUNICATING AT A DISTANCE EVEN BEFORE THE DAYS OF THE ELECTROMAGNET
770-131704-0034 THE TIES THAT BIND ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM IN TWINSHIP OF RELATION AND INTERACTION WERE DETECTED AND FARADAY'S WORK IN INDUCTION GAVE THE WORLD AT ONCE THE DYNAMO AND THE MOTOR HITCH YOUR WAGON TO A STAR SAID EMERSON
770-131704-0035 TO ALL THE COAL FIELDS AND ALL THE WATERFALLS FARADAY HAD DIRECTLY HITCHED THE WHEELS OF INDUSTRY NOT ONLY WAS IT NOW POSSIBLE TO CONVERT MECHANICAL ENERGY INTO ELECTRICITY CHEAPLY AND IN ILLIMITABLE QUANTITIES
770-131704-0036 BUT ELECTRICITY AT ONCE SHOWED ITS UBIQUITOUS AVAILABILITY AS A MOTIVE POWER BOATS WERE PROPELLED BY IT CARS WERE HAULED AND EVEN PAPERS PRINTED ELECTROPLATING BECAME AN ART
770-131704-0037 AND TELEGRAPHY SPRANG INTO ACTIVE BEING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC AT THE TIME EDISON WAS BORN IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN TELEGRAPHY UPON WHICH HE WAS TO LEAVE SO INDELIBLE AN IMPRINT HAD BARELY STRUGGLED INTO ACCEPTANCE BY THE PUBLIC
770-131704-0038 IN ENGLAND WHEATSTONE AND COOKE HAD INTRODUCED A PONDEROUS MAGNETIC NEEDLE TELEGRAPH IN AMERICA IN EIGHTEEN FORTY MORSE HAD TAKEN OUT HIS FIRST PATENT ON AN ELECTROMAGNETIC TELEGRAPH
770-131704-0039 THE PRINCIPLE OF WHICH IS DOMINATING IN THE ART TO THIS DAY FOUR YEARS LATER THE MEMORABLE MESSAGE WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT WAS SENT BY YOUNG MISS ELLSWORTH OVER HIS CIRCUITS AND INCREDULOUS WASHINGTON WAS ADVISED BY WIRE
770-131704-0040 OF THE ACTION OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION IN BALTIMORE IN NOMINATING POLK BY EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN CIRCUITS HAD BEEN STRUNG BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK UNDER PRIVATE ENTERPRISE THE GOVERNMENT HAVING DECLINED TO BUY THE MORSE SYSTEM FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
770-131704-0041 EVERYTHING WAS CRUDE AND PRIMITIVE THE POLES WERE TWO HUNDRED FEET APART AND COULD BARELY HOLD UP A WASH LINE
770-131704-0042 AND THE CIRCUIT WAS DOWN FOR THIRTY SIX DAYS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS THE LITTLE GLASS KNOB INSULATORS MADE SEDUCTIVE TARGETS FOR IGNORANT SPORTSMEN ATTEMPTS TO INSULATE THE LINE WIRE WERE LIMITED
770-131704-0043 TO COATING IT WITH TAR OR SMEARING IT WITH WAX FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL THE BEES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THE FARTHEST WESTERN REACH OF THE TELEGRAPH LINES IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN WAS PITTSBURG WITH THREE PLY IRON WIRE MOUNTED ON SQUARE GLASS INSULATORS
770-131704-0044 WITH A LITTLE WOODEN PENTROOF FOR PROTECTION IN THAT OFFICE WHERE ANDREW CARNEGIE WAS A MESSENGER BOY THE MAGNETS IN USE TO RECEIVE THE SIGNALS SENT WITH THE AID OF POWERFUL NITRIC ACID BATTERIES WEIGHED AS MUCH AS SEVENTY FIVE POUNDS APIECE
770-131704-0045 BUT THE BUSINESS WAS FORTUNATELY SMALL AT THE OUTSET UNTIL THE NEW DEVICE PATRONIZED CHIEFLY BY LOTTERY MEN HAD PROVED ITS UTILITY THEN CAME THE GREAT OUTBURST OF ACTIVITY
