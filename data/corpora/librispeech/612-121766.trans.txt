612-121766-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY NINE A DOUBLE EXPOSURE WHETHER THE KELPIE HAD RECOGNIZED US I COULD NOT TELL BUT NOT MUCH OF THE NEXT MORNING PASSED BEFORE MY DOUBT WAS OVER WHEN SHE HAD SET OUR PORRIDGE ON THE TABLE
612-121766-0001 SHE STOOD UP AND WITH HER FISTS IN HER SIDES ADDRESSED MY FATHER I'M VERY SORRY SIR TO HAVE TO MAKE COMPLAINTS IT'S A THING I DON'T LIKE AND I'M NOT GIVEN TO I'M SURE I TRY TO DO MY DUTY BY MASTER RANALD
612-121766-0002 AS WELL AS EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS HOUSE I FELT A LITTLE CONFUSED FOR I NOW SAW CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT MY FATHER COULD NOT APPROVE OF OUR PROCEEDINGS I WHISPERED TO ALLISTER RUN AND FETCH TURKEY TELL HIM TO COME DIRECTLY
612-121766-0003 ALLISTER ALWAYS DID WHATEVER I ASKED HIM HE SET OFF AT ONCE THE KELPIE LOOKED SUSPICIOUS AS HE LEFT THE ROOM BUT SHE HAD NO PRETEXT FOR INTERFERENCE I ALLOWED HER TO TELL HER TALE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
612-121766-0004 AFTER RELATING EXACTLY HOW WE HAD SERVED HER THE NIGHT BEFORE WHEN SHE HAD GONE ON A VISIT OF MERCY AS SHE REPRESENTED IT SHE ACCUSED ME OF ALL MY FORMER TRICKS THAT OF THE CAT HAVING I PRESUME ENLIGHTENED HER AS TO THE OTHERS
612-121766-0005 AND ENDED BY SAYING THAT IF SHE WERE NOT PROTECTED AGAINST ME AND TURKEY SHE MUST LEAVE THE PLACE LET HER GO FATHER I SAID NONE OF US LIKE HER I LIKE HER WHIMPERED LITTLE DAVIE SILENCE SIR
612-121766-0006 SAID MY FATHER VERY STERNLY ARE THESE THINGS TRUE YES FATHER I ANSWERED
612-121766-0007 SHE'S ONLY TOLD YOU HER SIDE OF IT YOU HAVE CONFESSED TO THE TRUTH OF WHAT SHE ALLEGES SAID MY FATHER I DID THINK HE WENT ON MORE IN SORROW THAN IN ANGER THOUGH A GOOD DEAL IN BOTH
612-121766-0008 THAT YOU HAD TURNED FROM YOUR BAD WAYS TO THINK OF MY TAKING YOU WITH ME TO THE DEATH BED OF A HOLY MAN AND THEN FINDING YOU SO SOON AFTER PLAYING SUCH TRICKS MORE LIKE THE MISCHIEVOUSNESS OF A MONKEY THAN OF A HUMAN BEING
612-121766-0009 I DON'T SAY IT WAS RIGHT FATHER AND I'M VERY SORRY IF I HAVE OFFENDED YOU YOU HAVE OFFENDED ME AND VERY DEEPLY YOU HAVE BEEN UNKIND AND INDEED CRUEL TO A GOOD WOMAN WHO HAS DONE HER BEST FOR YOU FOR MANY YEARS
612-121766-0010 I WAS NOT TOO MUCH ABASHED TO TAKE NOTICE THAT THE KELPIE BRIDLED AT THIS I CAN'T SAY I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I'VE DONE TO HER I SAID REALLY RANALD YOU ARE IMPERTINENT I WOULD SEND YOU OUT OF THE ROOM AT ONCE
612-121766-0011 BUT YOU MUST BEG MISSUS MITCHELL'S PARDON FIRST AND AFTER THAT THERE WILL BE SOMETHING MORE TO SAY I FEAR BUT FATHER YOU HAVE NOT HEARD MY STORY YET WELL GO ON IT IS FAIR I SUPPOSE TO HEAR BOTH SIDES
612-121766-0012 BUT NOTHING CAN JUSTIFY SUCH CONDUCT I BEGAN WITH TREMBLING VOICE I HAD GONE OVER IN MY MIND THE NIGHT BEFORE ALL I WOULD SAY KNOWING IT BETTER TO TELL THE TALE FROM THE BEGINNING CIRCUMSTANTIALLY
612-121766-0013 BEFORE I HAD ENDED TURKEY MADE HIS APPEARANCE USHERED IN BY ALLISTER BOTH WERE OUT OF BREATH WITH RUNNING MY FATHER STOPPED ME AND ORDERED TURKEY AWAY UNTIL I SHOULD HAVE FINISHED
612-121766-0014 I VENTURED TO LOOK UP AT THE KELPIE ONCE OR TWICE SHE HAD GROWN WHITE AND GREW WHITER WHEN TURKEY LEFT THE ROOM SHE WOULD HAVE GONE TOO BUT MY FATHER TOLD HER SHE MUST STAY AND HEAR ME TO THE END
612-121766-0015 SEVERAL TIMES SHE BROKE OUT ACCUSING ME OF TELLING A PACK OF WICKED LIES BUT MY FATHER TOLD HER SHE SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF DEFENDING HERSELF AND SHE MUST NOT INTERRUPT ME WHEN I HAD DONE HE CALLED TURKEY
612-121766-0016 AND MADE HIM TELL THE STORY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT ALTHOUGH HE QUESTIONED US CLOSELY HE FOUND NO DISCREPANCY BETWEEN OUR ACCOUNTS HE TURNED AT LAST TO MISSUS MITCHELL WHO BUT FOR HER RAGE
612-121766-0017 WOULD HAVE BEEN IN AN ABJECT CONDITION NOW MISSUS MITCHELL HE SAID SHE HAD NOTHING TO REPLY BEYOND ASSERTING THAT TURKEY AND I HAD ALWAYS HATED AND PERSECUTED HER AND HAD NOW TOLD A PACK OF LIES WHICH WE HAD AGREED UPON
612-121766-0018 TO RUIN HER A POOR LONE WOMAN WITH NO FRIENDS TO TAKE HER PART I DO NOT THINK IT LIKELY THEY COULD BE SO WICKED SAID MY FATHER SO I'M TO BE THE ONLY WICKED PERSON IN THE WORLD VERY WELL SIR
612-121766-0019 I WILL LEAVE THE HOUSE THIS VERY DAY NO NO MISSUS MITCHELL THAT WON'T DO ONE PARTY OR THE OTHER IS VERY WICKED THAT IS CLEAR AND IT IS OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE TO ME TO FIND OUT WHICH
612-121766-0020 IF YOU GO I SHALL KNOW IT IS YOU AND HAVE YOU TAKEN UP AND TRIED FOR STEALING MEANTIME I SHALL GO THE ROUND OF THE PARISH I DO NOT THINK ALL THE POOR PEOPLE WILL HAVE COMBINED TO LIE AGAINST YOU THEY ALL HATE ME SAID THE KELPIE
612-121766-0021 AND WHY ASKED MY FATHER SHE MADE NO ANSWER I MUST GET AT THE TRUTH OF IT SAID MY FATHER YOU CAN GO NOW SHE LEFT THE ROOM WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD AND MY FATHER TURNED TO TURKEY
612-121766-0022 I AM SURPRISED AT YOU TURKEY LENDING YOURSELF TO SUCH SILLY PRANKS WHY DID YOU NOT COME AND TELL ME I AM VERY SORRY SIR I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULD BE TROUBLED AT FINDING HOW WICKED SHE WAS
612-121766-0023 AND I THOUGHT WE MIGHT FRIGHTEN HER AWAY SOMEHOW BUT RANALD BEGAN HIS TRICKS WITHOUT LETTING ME KNOW AND THEN I SAW THAT MINE COULD BE OF NO USE FOR SHE WOULD SUSPECT THEM AFTER HIS MINE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SIR I HAVE NO DOUBT OF IT
612-121766-0024 BUT EQUALLY UNJUSTIFIABLE AND YOU AS WELL AS HE ACTED THE PART OF A FOUR FOOTED ANIMAL LAST NIGHT I CONFESS I YIELDED TO TEMPTATION THEN FOR I KNEW IT COULD DO NO GOOD IT WAS ALL FOR THE PLEASURE OF FRIGHTENING HER
612-121766-0025 IT WAS VERY FOOLISH OF ME AND I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR WELL TURKEY I CONFESS YOU HAVE VEXED ME NOT BY TRYING TO FIND OUT THE WRONG SHE WAS DOING ME AND THE WHOLE PARISH BUT BY TAKING THE WHOLE THING INTO YOUR OWN HANDS
612-121766-0026 IT IS WORSE OF YOU INASMUCH AS YOU ARE OLDER AND FAR WISER THAN RANALD IT IS WORSE OF RANALD BECAUSE I WAS HIS FATHER I WILL TRY TO SHOW YOU THE WRONG YOU HAVE DONE HAD YOU TOLD ME WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING YOURSELVES
612-121766-0027 THEN I MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING MISSUS MITCHELL TO REPENTANCE I COULD HAVE REASONED WITH HER ON THE MATTER AND SHOWN HER THAT SHE WAS NOT MERELY A THIEF BUT A THIEF OF THE WORST KIND A JUDAS WHO ROBBED THE POOR
612-121766-0028 AND SO ROBBED GOD I COULD HAVE SHOWN HER HOW CRUEL SHE WAS PLEASE SIR INTERRUPTED TURKEY I DON'T THINK AFTER ALL SHE DID IT FOR HERSELF I DO BELIEVE HE WENT ON AND MY FATHER LISTENED
612-121766-0029 THAT WANDERING WILLIE IS SOME RELATION OF HERS HE IS THE ONLY POOR PERSON ALMOST THE ONLY PERSON EXCEPT DAVIE I EVER SAW HER BEHAVE KINDLY TO HE WAS THERE LAST NIGHT AND ALSO I FANCY THAT OTHER TIME
612-121766-0030 WHEN RANALD GOT SUCH A FRIGHT SHE HAS POOR RELATIONS SOMEWHERE AND SENDS THE MEAL TO THEM BY WILLIE YOU REMEMBER SIR THERE WERE NO OLD CLOTHES OF ALLISTER'S TO BE FOUND WHEN YOU WANTED THEM FOR JAMIE DUFF
612-121766-0031 YOU MAY BE RIGHT TURKEY I DARE SAY YOU ARE RIGHT I HOPE YOU ARE FOR THOUGH BAD ENOUGH THAT WOULD NOT BE QUITE SO BAD AS DOING IT FOR HERSELF I AM VERY SORRY FATHER I SAID I BEG YOUR PARDON
612-121766-0032 I HOPE IT WILL BE A LESSON TO YOU MY BOY AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE DONE ROUSING EVERY BAD AND ANGRY PASSION IN HER I FEAR IT WILL BE OF NO USE TO TRY TO MAKE HER BE SORRY AND REPENT IT IS TO HER
612-121766-0033 NOT TO ME YOU HAVE DONE THE WRONG I HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF FOR MYSELF QUITE THE CONTRARY BUT IT IS A VERY DREADFUL THING TO THROW DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF REPENTANCE AND TURNING FROM EVIL WORKS
612-121766-0034 WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE UP FOR IT I SOBBED I DON'T SEE AT THIS MOMENT WHAT YOU CAN DO I WILL TURN IT OVER IN MY MIND YOU MAY GO NOW THEREUPON TURKEY AND I WALKED AWAY
612-121766-0035 I TO SCHOOL HE TO HIS CATTLE THE LECTURE MY FATHER HAD GIVEN US WAS NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN TURKEY LOOKED SAD AND I FELT SUBDUED AND CONCERNED
612-121766-0036 EVERYTHING MY FATHER HEARD CONFIRMED THE TALE WE HAD TOLD HIM BUT THE KELPIE FRUSTRATED WHATEVER HE MAY HAVE RESOLVED UPON WITH REGARD TO HER BEFORE HE RETURNED SHE HAD DISAPPEARED
612-121766-0037 HOW SHE MANAGED TO GET HER CHEST AWAY I CANNOT TELL I THINK SHE MUST HAVE HID IT IN SOME OUTHOUSE AND FETCHED IT THE NEXT NIGHT MANY LITTLE THINGS WERE MISSED FROM THE HOUSE AFTERWARDS BUT NOTHING OF GREAT VALUE
612-121766-0038 AND NEITHER SHE NOR WANDERING WILLIE EVER APPEARED AGAIN WE WERE ALL SATISFIED THAT POOR OLD BETTY KNEW NOTHING OF HER CONDUCT IT WAS EASY ENOUGH TO DECEIVE HER FOR SHE WAS ALONE IN HER COTTAGE ONLY WAITED UPON BY A NEIGHBOUR
612-121766-0039 WHO VISITED HER AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE DAY MY FATHER I HEARD AFTERWARDS GAVE FIVE SHILLINGS OUT OF HIS OWN POCKET TO EVERY ONE OF THE POOR PEOPLE
612-121766-0040 HER PLACE IN THE HOUSE WAS TO OUR ENDLESS HAPPINESS TAKEN BY KIRSTY AND FAITHFULLY SHE CARRIED OUT MY FATHER'S INSTRUCTIONS THAT ALONG WITH THE SACRED HANDFUL OF MEAL A PENNY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO EVERY ONE OF THE PARISH POOR
612-121766-0041 FROM THAT TIME FORWARD SO LONG AS HE LIVED AT THE MANSE NOT EVEN LITTLE DAVIE CRIED WHEN HE FOUND THAT MISSUS MITCHELL WAS REALLY GONE IT WAS MORE HIS OWN AFFECTION THAN HER KINDNESS THAT HAD ATTACHED HIM TO HER
