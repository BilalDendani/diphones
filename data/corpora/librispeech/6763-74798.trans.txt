6763-74798-0000 THE MOMENT OF RETIRING TO WHICH I HAD BEEN LOOKING FORWARD WITH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST AS ONE LIKELY TO BRING FRESH SURPRISES ARRIVED AT LAST IT BROUGHT ONLY EXTREME DISCOMFORT I WAS CONDUCTED WITHOUT A FLAT CANDLESTICK
6763-74798-0001 ALONG AN OBSCURE PASSAGE THEN AT RIGHT ANGLES WITH THE FIRST A SECOND BROADER LIGHTER PASSAGE LEADING PAST A GREAT MANY DOORS PLACED NEAR TOGETHER THESE I ASCERTAINED LATER WERE THE DORMITORIES OR SLEEPING CELLS
6763-74798-0002 AND WERE PLACED SIDE BY SIDE IN A ROW OPENING ON THE TERRACE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE HAVING REACHED THE DOOR OF MY BOX MY CONDUCTOR PUSHED BACK THE SLIDING PANEL AND WHEN I HAD GROPED MY WAY TO THE DARK INTERIOR CLOSED IT AGAIN BEHIND ME
6763-74798-0003 THERE WAS NO LIGHT FOR ME EXCEPT THE LIGHT OF THE STARS FOR DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE DOOR BY WHICH I HAD ENTERED STOOD ANOTHER OPEN WIDE TO THE NIGHT WHICH WAS APPARENTLY NOT INTENDED EVER TO BE CLOSED THE PROSPECT WAS THE ONE I HAD ALREADY SEEN
6763-74798-0004 THE WILDERNESS SLOPING TO THE RIVER
6763-74798-0005 THERE WAS NO SOUND SAVE THE HOOTING OF AN OWL IN THE DISTANCE AND THE WAILING NOTE OF SOME MOURNFUL MINDED WATER FOWL THE NIGHT AIR BLEW IN COLD AND MOIST WHICH MADE MY BONES ACHE THOUGH THEY WERE NOT BROKEN
6763-74798-0006 AND FEELING VERY SLEEPY AND MISERABLE I GROPED ABOUT UNTIL I WAS REWARDED BY DISCOVERING A NARROW BED OR COT OF TRELLIS WORK ON WHICH WAS A HARD STRAW PALLET AND A SMALL STRAW PILLOW ALSO FOLDED SMALL
6763-74798-0007 A KIND OF WOOLEN SLEEPING GARMENT TOO TIRED TO KEEP OUT OF EVEN SUCH AN UNINVITING BED I FLUNG OFF MY CLOTHES AND WITH MY MOLDY TWEEDS FOR ONLY COVERING I LAID ME DOWN BUT NOT TO SLEEP THE MISERY OF IT
6763-74798-0008 FOR ALTHOUGH MY BODY WAS WARM TOO WARM IN FACT THE WIND BLEW ON MY FACE AND BARE FEET AND LEGS AND MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SLEEP ABOUT MIDNIGHT I WAS JUST FALLING INTO A DOZE
6763-74798-0009 WHEN A SOUND AS OF A PERSON COMING WITH A SERIES OF JUMPS INTO THE ROOM DISTURBED ME AND STARTING UP I WAS HORRIFIED TO SEE SITTING ON THE FLOOR A GREAT BEAST MUCH TOO BIG FOR A DOG WITH LARGE ERECT EARS HE WAS INTENTLY WATCHING ME
6763-74798-0010 HIS ROUND EYES SHINING LIKE A PAIR OF GREEN PHOSPHORESCENT GLOBES HAVING NO WEAPON I WAS AT THE BRUTE'S MERCY AND WAS ABOUT TO UTTER A LOUD SHOUT TO SUMMON ASSISTANCE BUT AS HE SAT SO STILL I REFRAINED
6763-74798-0011 AND BEGAN EVEN TO HOPE THAT HE WOULD GO QUIETLY AWAY THEN HE STOOD UP WENT BACK TO THE DOOR AND SNIFFED AUDIBLY AT IT AND THINKING THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO RELIEVE ME OF HIS UNWELCOME PRESENCE I DROPPED MY HEAD ON THE PILLOW AND LAY PERFECTLY STILL
6763-74798-0012 THEN HE TURNED AND GLARED AT ME AGAIN AND FINALLY ADVANCING DELIBERATELY TO MY SIDE SNIFFED AT MY FACE IT WAS ALL OVER WITH ME NOW I THOUGHT AND CLOSING MY EYES AND FEELING MY FOREHEAD GROWING REMARKABLY MOIST IN SPITE OF THE COLD
6763-74798-0013 I MURMURED A LITTLE PRAYER WHEN I LOOKED AGAIN THE BRUTE HAD VANISHED TO MY INEXPRESSIBLE RELIEF IT SEEMED VERY ASTONISHING THAT AN ANIMAL LIKE A WOLF SHOULD COME INTO THE HOUSE BUT I SOON REMEMBERED THAT I HAD SEEN NO DOGS ABOUT
6763-74798-0014 SO THAT ALL KINDS OF SAVAGE PROWLING BEASTS COULD COME IN WITH IMPUNITY IT WAS GETTING BEYOND A JOKE BUT THEN ALL THIS SEEMED ONLY A FIT ENDING TO THE PERFECTLY ABSURD ARRANGEMENT INTO WHICH I HAD BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER GOODNESS GRACIOUS I EXCLAIMED
6763-74798-0015 SITTING BOLT UPRIGHT ON MY STRAW BED AM I A RATIONAL BEING OR AN INEBRIATED DONKEY OR WHAT TO HAVE CONSENTED TO SUCH A PROPOSAL
6763-74798-0016 AND I AM THEREFORE NOT MORALLY BOUND TO OBSERVE IT WHAT BE A FIELD LABORER A HEWER OF WOOD AND DRAWER OF WATER AND SLEEP ON A MISERABLE STRAW MAT IN AN OPEN PORCH WITH WOLVES FOR VISITORS AT ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT AND ALL FOR A FEW BARBAROUS RAGS
6763-74798-0017 BUT I SUPPOSE ANY ABLE BODIED MAN CAN EARN A POUND A WEEK AND THAT WOULD BE FIFTY TWO POUNDS FOR A SUIT OF CLOTHES WHO EVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING WOLVES AND ALL THROWN IN FOR NOTHING
6763-74798-0018 NO NO MY VENERABLE FRIEND THAT WAS ALL EXCELLENT ACTING ABOUT MY EXTRAORDINARY DELUSIONS AND THE REST OF IT BUT I AM NOT GOING TO BE CARRIED SO FAR BY THEM AS TO ADHERE TO SUCH AN OUTRAGEOUSLY ONE SIDED BARGAIN PRESENTLY
6763-74798-0019 I REMEMBERED TWO THINGS DIVINE YOLETTA WAS THE FIRST AND THE SECOND WAS THAT THOUGHT OF THE RARE PLEASURE IT WOULD BE TO ARRAY MYSELF IN THOSE SAME BARBAROUS RAGS AS I HAD BLASPHEMOUSLY CALLED THEM
6763-74798-0020 THESE THINGS HAD ENTERED INTO MY SOUL AND HAD BECOME A PART OF ME ESPECIALLY WELL BOTH THOSE STRANGE GARMENTS HAD LOOKED SO REFRESHINGLY PICTURESQUE AND I HAD CONCEIVED SUCH AN INTENSE LONGING TO WEAR THEM
6763-74798-0021 WAS IT A VERY CONTEMPTIBLE AMBITION ON MY PART IS IT SINFUL TO WISH FOR ANY ADORNMENTS OTHER THAN WISDOM AND SOBRIETY A MEEK AND LOVING SPIRIT GOOD WORKS AND OTHER THINGS OF THE KIND
6763-74798-0022 STRAIGHT INTO MY BRAIN FLASHED THE WORDS OF A SENTENCE I HAD RECENTLY READ THAT IS TO SAY JUST BEFORE MY ACCIDENT IN A BIOLOGICAL WORK AND IT COMFORTED ME AS MUCH AS IF AN ANGEL WITH SHINING FACE AND RAINBOW COLORED WINGS
6763-74798-0023 HAD PAID ME A VISIT IN MY DUSKY CELL UNTO ADAM ALSO AND HIS WIFE DID THE LORD GOD MAKE COATS OF SKIN AND CLOTHED THEM THIS HAS BECOME AS EVERY ONE KNOWS A CUSTOM AMONG THE RACE OF MEN
6763-74798-0024 AND SHOWS AT PRESENT NO SIGN OF BECOMING OBSOLETE MOREOVER THAT FIRST CORRELATION NAMELY MILK GLANDS AND A HAIRY COVERING APPEARS TO HAVE ENTERED THE VERY SOUL OF CREATURES OF THIS CLASS
6763-74798-0025 AND TO HAVE BECOME PSYCHICAL AS WELL AS PHYSICAL FOR IN THAT TYPE WHICH IS ONLY FOR A WHILE INFERIOR TO THE ANGELS THE FONDNESS FOR THIS KIND OF OUTER COVERING IS A STRONG INERADICABLE PASSION
6763-74798-0026 MOST TRUE AND NOBLE WORDS O BIOLOGIST OF THE FIERY SOUL IT WAS A DELIGHT TO REMEMBER THEM A STRONG AND INERADICABLE PASSION NOT MERELY TO CLOTHE THE BODY BUT TO CLOTHE IT APPROPRIATELY THAT IS TO SAY BEAUTIFULLY
6763-74798-0027 THIS BEING SO MUST WE GO ON FOR EVER SCRAPING OUR FACES WITH A SHARP IRON UNTIL THEY ARE BLUE AND SPOTTY WITH MANIFOLD SCRAPINGS AND CROPPING OUR HAIR SHORT TO GIVE OURSELVES AN ARTIFICIAL RESEMBLANCE TO OLD DOGS AND MONKEYS
6763-74798-0028 CREATURES LOWER THAN US IN THE SCALE OF BEING AND ARRAY OUR BODIES LIKE MUTES AT A FUNERAL IN REPULSIVE BLACK WE EUTHERIA OF THE EUTHERIA THE NOBLE OF THE NOBLE AND ALL FOR WHAT
6763-74798-0029 SINCE IT PLEASES NOT HEAVEN NOR ACCORDS WITH OUR OWN DESIRES FOR THE SAKE OF RESPECTABILITY PERHAPS WHATEVER THAT MAY MEAN OH THEN A MILLION CURSES TAKE IT RESPECTABILITY I MEAN MAY IT SINK INTO THE BOTTOMLESS PIT
6763-74798-0030 AND THE SMOKE OF ITS TORMENT ASCEND FOR EVER AND EVER AND HAVING THUS BY TAKING THOUGHT BROUGHT MY MIND INTO THIS TEMPER I ONCE MORE FINALLY DETERMINED TO HAVE THE CLOTHES AND RELIGIOUSLY TO OBSERVE THE COMPACT
6763-74798-0031 IT MADE ME QUITE HAPPY TO END IT IN THIS WAY THE HARD BED THE COLD NIGHT WIND BLOWING ON ME MY WOLFISH VISITOR WERE ALL FORGOTTEN ONCE MORE I GAVE LOOSE TO MY IMAGINATION AND SAW MYSELF
6763-74798-0032 CLOTHED AND IN MY RIGHT MIND SITTING AT YOLETTA'S FEET LEARNING THE MYSTERY OF THAT SWEET TRANQUIL LIFE FROM HER PRECIOUS LIPS A WHOLE YEAR WAS MINE IN WHICH TO LOVE HER AND WIN HER GENTLE HEART BUT HER HAND AH THAT WAS ANOTHER MATTER
6763-74798-0033 WHAT HAD I TO GIVE IN RETURN FOR SUCH A BOON AS THAT ONLY THAT STRENGTH CONCERNING WHICH MY VENERABLE HOST HAD SPOKEN SOMEWHAT ENCOURAGINGLY HE HAD ALSO BEEN SO GOOD AS TO MENTION MY SKILL
6763-74798-0034 BUT I COULD SCARCELY TRADE ON THAT AND IF A WHOLE YEAR'S LABOR WAS ONLY SUFFICIENT TO PAY FOR A SUIT OF CLOTHING HOW MANY YEARS OF TOIL WOULD BE REQUIRED TO WIN YOLETTA'S HAND NATURALLY AT THIS JUNCTURE
6763-74798-0035 I BEGAN TO DRAW A PARALLEL BETWEEN MY CASE AND THAT OF AN ANCIENT HISTORICAL PERSONAGE WHOSE NAME IS FAMILIAR TO MOST HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF WITH VARIATIONS JACOB NAMELY SMITH COMETH TO THE WELL OF HARAN
6763-74798-0036 HE TAKETH ACQUAINTANCE OF RACHEL HERE CALLED YOLETTA AND JACOB KISSED RACHEL AND LIFTED UP HIS VOICE AND WEPT THAT IS A TOUCH OF NATURE I CAN THOROUGHLY APPRECIATE THE KISSING I MEAN BUT WHY HE WEPT I CANNOT TELL
6763-74798-0037 UNLESS IT BE BECAUSE HE WAS NOT AN ENGLISHMAN AND JACOB TOLD RACHEL THAT HE WAS HER FATHER'S BROTHER I AM GLAD TO HAVE NO SUCH STARTLING PIECE OF INFORMATION TO GIVE TO THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTIONS WE ARE NOT EVEN DISTANT RELATIONS AND HER AGE BEING
6763-74798-0038 SAY FIFTEEN AND MINE TWENTY ONE WE ARE SO FAR WELL SUITED TO EACH OTHER ACCORDING TO MY NOTIONS SMITH COVENANTED FOR YOLETTA AND SAID I WILL SERVE THEE SEVEN YEARS FOR YOLETTA THY YOUNGER DAUGHTER
6763-74798-0039 AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN ANSWERED ABIDE WITH ME FOR I WOULD RATHER YOU SHOULD HAVE HER THAN SOME OTHER PERSON NOW I WONDER WHETHER THE MATTER WILL BE COMPLICATED WITH LEAH THAT IS EDRA
6763-74798-0040 AND LIKE EDRA TENDER EYED I DO NOT ASPIRE OR DESIRE TO MARRY BOTH ESPECIALLY IF I SHOULD LIKE JACOB HAVE TO BEGIN WITH THE WRONG ONE HOWEVER TENDER EYED
