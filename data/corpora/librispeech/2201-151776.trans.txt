2201-151776-0000 AS IT IS THE POWER OF EXCHANGING THAT GIVES OCCASION TO THE DIVISION OF LABOUR SO THE EXTENT OF THIS DIVISION MUST ALWAYS BE LIMITED BY THE EXTENT OF THAT POWER OR IN OTHER WORDS BY THE EXTENT OF THE MARKET
2201-151776-0001 WHEN THE MARKET IS VERY SMALL NO PERSON CAN HAVE ANY ENCOURAGEMENT TO DEDICATE HIMSELF ENTIRELY TO ONE EMPLOYMENT FOR WANT OF THE POWER TO EXCHANGE ALL THAT SURPLUS PART OF THE PRODUCE OF HIS OWN LABOUR WHICH IS OVER AND ABOVE HIS OWN CONSUMPTION
2201-151776-0002 FOR SUCH PARTS OF THE PRODUCE OF OTHER MEN'S LABOUR AS HE HAS OCCASION FOR THERE ARE SOME SORTS OF INDUSTRY EVEN OF THE LOWEST KIND WHICH CAN BE CARRIED ON NOWHERE BUT IN A GREAT TOWN A PORTER FOR EXAMPLE CAN FIND EMPLOYMENT AND SUBSISTENCE IN NO OTHER PLACE
2201-151776-0003 A VILLAGE IS BY MUCH TOO NARROW A SPHERE FOR HIM EVEN AN ORDINARY MARKET TOWN IS SCARCE LARGE ENOUGH TO AFFORD HIM CONSTANT OCCUPATION IN THE LONE HOUSES AND VERY SMALL VILLAGES WHICH ARE SCATTERED ABOUT IN SO DESERT A COUNTRY AS THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND
2201-151776-0004 EVERY FARMER MUST BE BUTCHER BAKER AND BREWER FOR HIS OWN FAMILY IN SUCH SITUATIONS WE CAN SCARCE EXPECT TO FIND EVEN A SMITH A CARPENTER OR A MASON WITHIN LESS THAN TWENTY MILES OF ANOTHER OF THE SAME TRADE
2201-151776-0005 THE SCATTERED FAMILIES THAT LIVE AT EIGHT OR TEN MILES DISTANCE FROM THE NEAREST OF THEM MUST LEARN TO PERFORM THEMSELVES A GREAT NUMBER OF LITTLE PIECES OF WORK FOR WHICH IN MORE POPULOUS COUNTRIES THEY WOULD CALL IN THE ASSISTANCE OF THOSE WORKMEN
2201-151776-0006 A COUNTRY CARPENTER DEALS IN EVERY SORT OF WORK THAT IS MADE OF WOOD A COUNTRY SMITH IN EVERY SORT OF WORK THAT IS MADE OF IRON THE FORMER IS NOT ONLY A CARPENTER BUT A JOINER A CABINET MAKER AND EVEN A CARVER IN WOOD AS WELL AS A WHEEL WRIGHT A PLOUGH WRIGHT A CART AND WAGGON MAKER
2201-151776-0007 THE EMPLOYMENTS OF THE LATTER ARE STILL MORE VARIOUS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THERE SHOULD BE SUCH A TRADE AS EVEN THAT OF A NAILER IN THE REMOTE AND INLAND PARTS OF THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND
2201-151776-0008 SUCH A WORKMAN AT THE RATE OF A THOUSAND NAILS A DAY AND THREE HUNDRED WORKING DAYS IN THE YEAR WILL MAKE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND NAILS IN THE YEAR BUT IN SUCH A SITUATION IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DISPOSE OF ONE THOUSAND THAT IS OF ONE DAY'S WORK IN THE YEAR
2201-151776-0009 AND IT IS FREQUENTLY NOT TILL A LONG TIME AFTER THAT THOSE IMPROVEMENTS EXTEND THEMSELVES TO THE INLAND PARTS OF THE COUNTRY A BROAD WHEELED WAGGON ATTENDED BY TWO MEN AND DRAWN BY EIGHT HORSES IN ABOUT SIX WEEKS TIME CARRIES AND BRINGS BACK BETWEEN LONDON AND EDINBURGH
2201-151776-0010 NEAR FOUR TON WEIGHT OF GOODS IN ABOUT THE SAME TIME A SHIP NAVIGATED BY SIX OR EIGHT MEN AND SAILING BETWEEN THE PORTS OF LONDON AND LEITH FREQUENTLY CARRIES AND BRINGS BACK TWO HUNDRED TON WEIGHT OF GOODS
2201-151776-0011 SIX OR EIGHT MEN THEREFORE BY THE HELP OF WATER CARRIAGE CAN CARRY AND BRING BACK IN THE SAME TIME THE SAME QUANTITY OF GOODS BETWEEN LONDON AND EDINBURGH AS FIFTY BROAD WHEELED WAGGONS ATTENDED BY A HUNDRED MEN AND DRAWN BY FOUR HUNDRED HORSES
2201-151776-0012 UPON TWO HUNDRED TONS OF GOODS THEREFORE CARRIED BY THE CHEAPEST LAND CARRIAGE FROM LONDON TO EDINBURGH THERE MUST BE CHARGED THE MAINTENANCE OF A HUNDRED MEN FOR THREE WEEKS AND BOTH THE MAINTENANCE AND WHAT IS NEARLY EQUAL TO MAINTENANCE THE WEAR AND TEAR OF FOUR HUNDRED HORSES
2201-151776-0013 AS WELL AS OF FIFTY GREAT WAGGONS WHEREAS UPON THE SAME QUANTITY OF GOODS CARRIED BY WATER THERE IS TO BE CHARGED ONLY THE MAINTENANCE OF SIX OR EIGHT MEN AND THE WEAR AND TEAR OF A SHIP OF TWO HUNDRED TONS BURTHEN TOGETHER WITH THE VALUE OF THE SUPERIOR RISK
2201-151776-0014 OR THE DIFFERENCE OF THE INSURANCE BETWEEN LAND AND WATER CARRIAGE WERE THERE NO OTHER COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THOSE TWO PLACES THEREFORE BUT BY LAND CARRIAGE AS NO GOODS COULD BE TRANSPORTED FROM THE ONE TO THE OTHER EXCEPT SUCH WHOSE PRICE WAS VERY CONSIDERABLE IN PROPORTION TO THEIR WEIGHT
2201-151776-0015 THEY COULD CARRY ON BUT A SMALL PART OF THAT COMMERCE WHICH AT PRESENT SUBSISTS BETWEEN THEM AND CONSEQUENTLY COULD GIVE BUT A SMALL PART OF THAT ENCOURAGEMENT WHICH THEY AT PRESENT MUTUALLY AFFORD TO EACH OTHER'S INDUSTRY
2201-151776-0016 THERE COULD BE LITTLE OR NO COMMERCE OF ANY KIND BETWEEN THE DISTANT PARTS OF THE WORLD WHAT GOODS COULD BEAR THE EXPENSE OF LAND CARRIAGE BETWEEN LONDON AND CALCUTTA
2201-151776-0017 SINCE SUCH THEREFORE ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF WATER CARRIAGE IT IS NATURAL THAT THE FIRST IMPROVEMENTS OF ART AND INDUSTRY SHOULD BE MADE WHERE THIS CONVENIENCY OPENS THE WHOLE WORLD FOR A MARKET TO THE PRODUCE OF EVERY SORT OF LABOUR
2201-151776-0018 AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR IMPROVEMENT MUST ALWAYS BE POSTERIOR TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF THAT COUNTRY IN OUR NORTH AMERICAN COLONIES THE PLANTATIONS HAVE CONSTANTLY FOLLOWED EITHER THE SEA COAST OR THE BANKS OF THE NAVIGABLE RIVERS
2201-151776-0019 AND HAVE SCARCE ANYWHERE EXTENDED THEMSELVES TO ANY CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM BOTH THE NATIONS THAT ACCORDING TO THE BEST AUTHENTICATED HISTORY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN FIRST CIVILIZED WERE THOSE THAT DWELT ROUND THE COAST OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA
2201-151776-0020 THAT SEA BY FAR THE GREATEST INLET THAT IS KNOWN IN THE WORLD HAVING NO TIDES NOR CONSEQUENTLY ANY WAVES EXCEPT SUCH AS ARE CAUSED BY THE WIND ONLY WAS BY THE SMOOTHNESS OF ITS SURFACE AS WELL AS BY THE MULTITUDE OF ITS ISLANDS AND THE PROXIMITY OF ITS NEIGHBOURING SHORES
2201-151776-0021 EXTREMELY FAVOURABLE TO THE INFANT NAVIGATION OF THE WORLD WHEN FROM THEIR IGNORANCE OF THE COMPASS MEN WERE AFRAID TO QUIT THE VIEW OF THE COAST AND FROM THE IMPERFECTION OF THE ART OF SHIP BUILDING TO ABANDON THEMSELVES TO THE BOISTEROUS WAVES OF THE OCEAN
2201-151776-0022 TO PASS BEYOND THE PILLARS OF HERCULES THAT IS TO SAIL OUT OF THE STRAITS OF GIBRALTAR WAS IN THE ANCIENT WORLD LONG CONSIDERED AS A MOST WONDERFUL AND DANGEROUS EXPLOIT OF NAVIGATION
2201-151776-0023 UPPER EGYPT EXTENDS ITSELF NOWHERE ABOVE A FEW MILES FROM THE NILE AND IN LOWER EGYPT THAT GREAT RIVER BREAKS ITSELF INTO MANY DIFFERENT CANALS WHICH WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A LITTLE ART SEEM TO HAVE AFFORDED A COMMUNICATION BY WATER CARRIAGE
2201-151776-0024 THE EXTENT AND EASINESS OF THIS INLAND NAVIGATION WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL CAUSES OF THE EARLY IMPROVEMENT OF EGYPT THE IMPROVEMENTS IN AGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURES
2201-151776-0025 IN THE EAST INDIES AND IN SOME OF THE EASTERN PROVINCES OF CHINA THOUGH THE GREAT EXTENT OF THIS ANTIQUITY IS NOT AUTHENTICATED BY ANY HISTORIES OF WHOSE AUTHORITY WE IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD ARE WELL ASSURED
2201-151776-0026 A MULTITUDE OF CANALS AND BY COMMUNICATING WITH ONE ANOTHER AFFORD AN INLAND NAVIGATION MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE THAN THAT EITHER OF THE NILE OR THE GANGES OR PERHAPS THAN BOTH OF THEM PUT TOGETHER IT IS REMARKABLE THAT NEITHER THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS NOR THE INDIANS
2201-151776-0027 NOR THE CHINESE ENCOURAGED FOREIGN COMMERCE BUT SEEM ALL TO HAVE DERIVED THEIR GREAT OPULENCE FROM THIS INLAND NAVIGATION ALL THE INLAND PARTS OF AFRICA AND ALL THAT PART OF ASIA WHICH LIES ANY CONSIDERABLE WAY NORTH OF THE EUXINE AND CASPIAN SEAS
2201-151776-0028 THE ANCIENT SCYTHIA THE MODERN TARTARY AND SIBERIA SEEM IN ALL AGES OF THE WORLD TO HAVE BEEN IN THE SAME BARBAROUS AND UNCIVILIZED STATE IN WHICH WE FIND THEM AT PRESENT
2201-151776-0029 THE SEA OF TARTARY IS THE FROZEN OCEAN WHICH ADMITS OF NO NAVIGATION AND THOUGH SOME OF THE GREATEST RIVERS IN THE WORLD RUN THROUGH THAT COUNTRY THEY ARE AT TOO GREAT A DISTANCE FROM ONE ANOTHER TO CARRY COMMERCE AND COMMUNICATION THROUGH THE GREATER PART OF IT
2201-151776-0030 THERE ARE IN AFRICA NONE OF THOSE GREAT INLETS SUCH AS THE BALTIC AND ADRIATIC SEAS IN EUROPE THE MEDITERRANEAN AND EUXINE SEAS IN BOTH EUROPE AND ASIA AND THE GULFS OF ARABIA PERSIA INDIA BENGAL AND SIAM IN ASIA
2201-151776-0031 TO CARRY MARITIME COMMERCE INTO THE INTERIOR PARTS OF THAT GREAT CONTINENT AND THE GREAT RIVERS OF AFRICA ARE AT TOO GREAT A DISTANCE FROM ONE ANOTHER TO GIVE OCCASION TO ANY CONSIDERABLE INLAND NAVIGATION THE COMMERCE BESIDES WHICH ANY NATION CAN CARRY ON BY MEANS OF A RIVER
