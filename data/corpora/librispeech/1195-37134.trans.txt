1195-37134-0000 IN FORMER TIMES EVERY WOMAN WHO GAVE BIRTH TO A CHILD OR PASSED THROUGH A MISCARRIAGE WAS EXPOSED TO GRAVE DANGER OF INFECTION OR CHILD BED FEVER BUT AT PRESENT THANKS TO THE RECOGNITION OF THE BACTERIAL ORIGIN OF THE DISEASE AND OF ITS IDENTITY WITH WOUND INFECTION
1195-37134-0001 THIS DANGER CAN BE PRACTICALLY ELIMINATED BY THE RIGID OBSERVANCE OF SURGICAL CLEANLINESS AND ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE PHYSICIANS HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD OF COPING WITH OTHER SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS OF PREGNANCY AND LABOR
1195-37134-0002 OR AT LEAST BY SUBJECTING THEM TO TREATMENT IN THEIR EARLIEST STAGES FOR IF THEY BE ALLOWED TO GO ON TO FULL DEVELOPMENT THE RESULTS ARE LITTLE BETTER THAN IN TIMES PAST FURTHERMORE
1195-37134-0003 TIMELY RECOGNITION OF SUCH CONDITIONS MAKES APPROPRIATE TREATMENT POSSIBLE AND PRACTICALLY INSURES A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME WHILE TARDY RECOGNITION IS FREQUENTLY FOLLOWED BY DISASTROUS RESULTS
1195-37134-0004 THESE FEW EXAMPLES GIVE SOME IDEA OF THE BENEFITS OF PROPHYLAXIS IN THE PRACTICE OF OBSTETRICS PROSPECTIVE MOTHERS SHOULD UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY THAT THERE IS AN ADVANTAGE IN TAKING SUCH PRECAUTIONS BUT THAT THEY MAY BE RISKING THEIR LIVES
1195-37134-0005 OR AT LEAST THEIR FUTURE WELL BEING UNLESS THEY INSIST UPON COMPETENT MEDICAL ATTENTION IT IS TRUE OF COURSE THAT PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH ARE GENERALLY NORMAL PROCESSES BUT THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS SO FORTUNATELY
1195-37134-0006 MOST OF THE ABNORMALITIES GIVE TIMELY WARNING OF THEIR OCCURRENCE AND IN MOST INSTANCES MAY BE RELIEVED BY COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE MEASURES OR IF NOT THEY AFFORD INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO A HAPPY TERMINATION
1195-37134-0007 THE RECOGNITION OF THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH CONDITIONS HOWEVER IS NOT ALWAYS EASY AND THEIR IDEAL TREATMENT REQUIRES CAREFUL TRAINING AND SOMETIMES THE UTMOST NICETY OF JUDGMENT CONSEQUENTLY
1195-37134-0008 BUT INSTEAD THE FAMILY PHYSICIAN SHOULD BE CONSULTED WHO SHOULD HE FEEL UNWILLING TO ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CASE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOMMEND A THOROUGHLY COMPETENT SUBSTITUTE FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A TEACHER AND CONSULTANT
1195-37134-0009 I STATE WITHOUT HESITATION THAT IN NO OTHER BRANCH OF MEDICINE OR SURGERY ARE GRAVER EMERGENCIES ENCOUNTERED THAN IN CERTAIN OBSTETRICAL COMPLICATIONS WHOSE TREATMENT INVOLVES THE GREATEST RESPONSIBILITY AND REQUIRES THE HIGHEST ORDER OF ABILITY
1195-37134-0010 TO INSURE A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME FOR THE MOTHER AND HER CHILD FOR THESE REASONS A PHYSICIAN SHOULD BE CHOSEN ONLY AFTER MATURE DELIBERATION AND HIS SERVICES SHOULD BE ESTEEMED MUCH MORE HIGHLY THAN IS USUALLY THE CASE
1195-37134-0011 IN ORDER THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF PREVENTION MAY RECEIVE THEIR FULLEST APPLICATION DURING PREGNANCY LABOR AND THE LYING IN PERIOD IT IS ALSO ADVISABLE THAT INTELLIGENT WOMEN SHOULD POSSESS SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE REPRODUCTIVE PROCESS IN HUMAN BEINGS
1195-37134-0012 WHICH I CAN THOROUGHLY RECOMMEND TO PROSPECTIVE MOTHERS THE SUBJECT MATTER HAS BEEN CAREFULLY CHOSEN AND THE AUTHOR HAS WISELY REFRAINED FROM GIVING ADVICE WITH REGARD TO TREATMENT WHICH CAN BE SATISFACTORILY DIRECTED ONLY AFTER CAREFUL STUDY BY A PHYSICIAN
1195-37134-0013 AT THE SAME TIME HE HAS GIVEN A CLEAR ACCOUNT OF THE PHYSIOLOGY OF PREGNANCY AND LABOR AND HAS LAID DOWN SOUND RULES FOR THE GUIDANCE OF THE PATIENT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTS EMPHASIZED BY DOCTOR SLEMONS
1195-37134-0014 IS THE VALUE OF MEDICAL SUPERVISION FOR SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER THE CHILD IS BORN THIS PRECAUTION CONTRIBUTES GREATLY TOWARD A RAPID AND COMPLETE CONVALESCENCE DURING THE LYING IN PERIOD THE PHYSICIAN SHOULD SUPERVISE THE CARE OF THE MOTHER AND THE CHILD
1195-37134-0015 SHOULD INSIST UPON THE NECESSITY FOR MATERNAL NURSING AND SHOULD KEEP THE MOTHER UNDER OBSERVATION UNTIL PERFECTLY NORMAL CONDITIONS ARE REGAINED IF THE LATTER DUTY IS CONSCIENTIOUSLY FULFILLED MANY YEARS OF INVALIDISM MAY BE SAVED
1195-37134-0016 AND THOUSANDS OF OPERATIONS RENDERED UNNECESSARY ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN NOTABLE ADVANCES IN THE SCIENCE AND IN THE ART OF OBSTETRICS SINCE THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY A GREAT MANY FUNDAMENTAL FACTS MUST YET BE LEARNED
1195-37134-0017 FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE ALMOST TOTALLY IGNORANT OF THE STIMULUS WHICH CAUSES THE MOTHER TO FALL INTO LABOR APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AFTER THE LAST NORMAL MENSTRUATION THERE ARE TWO POINTS WHICH I DESIRE TO IMPRESS ESPECIALLY UPON THE READERS OF THIS BOOK
1195-37134-0018 THEY MUST COME TO REALIZE THAT THEY WILL SECURE THE BEST TREATMENT ONLY AS THEY DEMAND THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF EXCELLENCE FROM THEIR ATTENDANTS AND THEY CAN AID IN SECURING THIS FOR THEIR POORER SISTERS AND THEIR CHILDREN BY INTERESTING THEMSELVES IN OBSTETRICAL CHARITIES
1195-37134-0019 SECONDLY THEY MUST REALIZE THAT REAL PROGRESS IN THE SCIENCE OF OBSTETRICS CAN BE EXPECTED TO PROCEED ONLY FROM WELL EQUIPPED CLINICS CONNECTED WITH STRONG UNIVERSITIES AND IN CHARGE OF THOROUGHLY TRAINED AND BROAD MINDED MEN
1195-37134-0020 AS YET SUCH INSTITUTIONS SCARCELY EXIST IN THIS COUNTRY WOMEN WHO ARE ANXIOUS TO PROMOTE THE WELFARE OF THEIR SEX CAN FIND NO BETTER WAY OF DOING SO THAN BY BRINGING THIS NEED TO THE ATTENTION OF WEALTHY MEN INTERESTED IN PHILANTHROPY AND EDUCATION
1195-37134-0021 HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO ITS PRESENT DEGREE OF PERFECTION AND FURTHER PROGRESS CAN SCARCELY BE EXPECTED WITHOUT ITS AID THEY SHOULD REMEMBER ALSO THAT WHENEVER THEY TAKE SUCH A WELL KNOWN DRUG AS ERGOT FOR THE CONTROL OF BLEEDING
