4235-7633-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE GREEN LIGHT WHEN OLD MISTER SALTON HAD RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT ADAM AND SIR NATHANIEL RETURNED TO THE STUDY THINGS WENT WITH GREAT REGULARITY AT LESSER HILL SO THEY KNEW THAT THERE WOULD BE NO INTERRUPTION TO THEIR TALK
4235-7633-0001 WHEN THEIR CIGARS WERE LIGHTED SIR NATHANIEL BEGAN I HOPE ADAM THAT YOU DO NOT THINK ME EITHER SLACK OR CHANGEABLE OF PURPOSE I MEAN TO GO THROUGH THIS BUSINESS TO THE BITTER END WHATEVER IT MAY BE
4235-7633-0002 BE SATISFIED THAT MY FIRST CARE IS AND SHALL BE THE PROTECTION OF MIMI WATFORD TO THAT I AM PLEDGED MY DEAR BOY WE WHO ARE INTERESTED ARE ALL IN THE SAME DANGER THAT SEMI HUMAN MONSTER OUT OF THE PIT HATES
4235-7633-0003 AND MEANS TO DESTROY US ALL YOU AND ME CERTAINLY AND PROBABLY YOUR UNCLE I WANTED ESPECIALLY TO TALK WITH YOU TO NIGHT FOR I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT THE TIME IS FAST COMING IF IT HAS NOT COME ALREADY WHEN WE MUST TAKE YOUR UNCLE INTO OUR CONFIDENCE
4235-7633-0004 IT WAS ONE THING WHEN FANCIED EVILS THREATENED BUT NOW HE IS PROBABLY MARKED FOR DEATH AND IT IS ONLY RIGHT THAT HE SHOULD KNOW ALL I AM WITH YOU SIR THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE WE AGREED TO KEEP HIM OUT OF THE TROUBLE NOW WE DARE NOT
4235-7633-0005 CONSIDERATION FOR HIS FEELINGS MIGHT COST HIS LIFE IT IS A DUTY AND NO LIGHT OR PLEASANT ONE EITHER I HAVE NOT A SHADOW OF DOUBT THAT HE WILL WANT TO BE ONE WITH US IN THIS BUT REMEMBER WE ARE HIS GUESTS HIS NAME HIS HONOUR HAVE TO BE THOUGHT OF AS WELL AS HIS SAFETY
4235-7633-0006 ALL SHALL BE AS YOU WISH ADAM AND NOW AS TO WHAT WE ARE TO DO WE CANNOT MURDER LADY ARABELLA OFF HAND THEREFORE WE SHALL HAVE TO PUT THINGS IN ORDER FOR THE KILLING AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE CANNOT BE TAXED WITH A CRIME
4235-7633-0007 IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT WE ARE IN AN EXCEEDINGLY TIGHT PLACE OUR FIRST DIFFICULTY IS TO KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN I NEVER THOUGHT THIS FIGHTING AN ANTEDILUVIAN MONSTER WOULD BE SUCH A COMPLICATED JOB
4235-7633-0008 THIS ONE IS A WOMAN WITH ALL A WOMAN'S WIT COMBINED WITH THE HEARTLESSNESS OF A COCOTTE
4235-7633-0009 WE MAY BE SURE THAT IN THE FIGHT THAT IS BEFORE US THERE WILL BE NO SEMBLANCE OF FAIR PLAY ALSO THAT OUR UNSCRUPULOUS OPPONENT WILL NOT BETRAY HERSELF THAT IS SO BUT BEING FEMININE SHE WILL PROBABLY OVER REACH HERSELF
4235-7633-0010 NOW ADAM IT STRIKES ME THAT AS WE HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND OTHERS AGAINST FEMININE NATURE OUR STRONG GAME WILL BE TO PLAY OUR MASCULINE AGAINST HER FEMININE PERHAPS WE HAD BETTER SLEEP ON IT SHE IS A THING OF THE NIGHT
4235-7633-0011 AND THE NIGHT MAY GIVE US SOME IDEAS SO THEY BOTH TURNED IN ADAM KNOCKED AT SIR NATHANIEL'S DOOR IN THE GREY OF THE MORNING AND ON BEING BIDDEN CAME INTO THE ROOM HE HAD SEVERAL LETTERS IN HIS HAND SIR NATHANIEL SAT UP IN BED WELL
4235-7633-0012 IN FACT WITH A SMILE AND A BLUSH THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS WHICH I WANT TO DO BUT I HOLD MY HAND AND MY TONGUE TILL I HAVE YOUR APPROVAL GO ON SAID THE OTHER KINDLY TELL ME ALL AND COUNT AT ANY RATE ON MY SYMPATHY AND ON MY APPROVAL AND HELP IF I CAN SEE MY WAY
4235-7633-0013 ACCORDINGLY ADAM PROCEEDED WHEN I TOLD YOU THE CONCLUSIONS AT WHICH I HAD ARRIVED I PUT IN THE FOREGROUND THAT MIMI WATFORD SHOULD FOR THE SAKE OF HER OWN SAFETY
4235-7633-0014 YES THAT IS SO TO CARRY THIS INTO PRACTICE SIR ONE PRELIMINARY IS REQUIRED UNLESS HARM OF ANOTHER KIND IS TO BE FACED MIMI SHOULD HAVE SOME PROTECTOR WHOM ALL THE WORLD WOULD RECOGNISE THE ONLY FORM RECOGNISED BY CONVENTION IS MARRIAGE
4235-7633-0015 SIR NATHANIEL SMILED IN A FATHERLY WAY TO MARRY A HUSBAND IS REQUIRED AND THAT HUSBAND SHOULD BE YOU YES YES AND THE MARRIAGE SHOULD BE IMMEDIATE AND SECRET OR AT LEAST NOT SPOKEN OF OUTSIDE OURSELVES
4235-7633-0016 WOULD THE YOUNG LADY BE AGREEABLE TO THAT PROCEEDING I DO NOT KNOW SIR THEN HOW ARE WE TO PROCEED I SUPPOSE THAT WE OR ONE OF US MUST ASK HER IS THIS A SUDDEN IDEA ADAM A SUDDEN RESOLUTION
4235-7633-0017 A SUDDEN RESOLUTION SIR BUT NOT A SUDDEN IDEA IF SHE AGREES ALL IS WELL AND GOOD THE SEQUENCE IS OBVIOUS AND IT IS TO BE KEPT A SECRET AMONGST OURSELVES I WANT NO SECRET SIR EXCEPT FOR MIMI'S GOOD FOR MYSELF I SHOULD LIKE TO SHOUT IT FROM THE HOUSE TOPS
4235-7633-0018 AND HOW WOULD YOU SUGGEST ADAM THAT WE COULD COMBINE THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION WITH SECRECY ADAM GREW RED AND MOVED UNEASILY SOMEONE MUST ASK HER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THAT SOMEONE I THOUGHT THAT YOU SIR WOULD BE SO GOOD
4235-7633-0019 GOD BLESS MY SOUL THIS IS A NEW KIND OF DUTY TO TAKE ON AT MY TIME OF LIFE ADAM I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN COUNT ON ME TO HELP IN ANY WAY I CAN I HAVE ALREADY COUNTED ON YOU SIR WHEN I VENTURED TO MAKE SUCH A SUGGESTION
4235-7633-0020 I CAN ONLY ASK HE ADDED THAT YOU WILL BE MORE THAN EVER KIND TO ME TO US AND LOOK ON THE PAINFUL DUTY AS A VOLUNTARY ACT OF GRACE PROMPTED BY KINDNESS AND AFFECTION PAINFUL DUTY YES SAID ADAM BOLDLY PAINFUL TO YOU THOUGH TO ME IT WOULD BE ALL JOYFUL
4235-7633-0021 IT IS A STRANGE JOB FOR AN EARLY MORNING WELL WE ALL LIVE AND LEARN I SUPPOSE THE SOONER I GO THE BETTER YOU HAD BETTER WRITE A LINE FOR ME TO TAKE WITH ME FOR YOU SEE THIS IS TO BE A SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL TRANSACTION AND IT MAY BE EMBARRASSING TO THE LADY EVEN TO MYSELF
4235-7633-0022 SO WE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF WARRANT SOMETHING TO SHOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN MINDFUL OF HER FEELINGS IT WILL NOT DO TO TAKE ACQUIESCENCE FOR GRANTED ALTHOUGH WE ACT FOR HER GOOD SIR NATHANIEL YOU ARE A TRUE FRIEND
4235-7633-0023 I AM SURE THAT BOTH MIMI AND I SHALL BE GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR ALL OUR LIVES HOWEVER LONG THEY MAY BE SO THE TWO TALKED IT OVER AND AGREED AS TO POINTS TO BE BORNE IN MIND BY THE AMBASSADOR IT WAS STRIKING TEN WHEN SIR NATHANIEL LEFT THE HOUSE ADAM SEEING HIM QUIETLY OFF
4235-7633-0024 AS THE YOUNG MAN FOLLOWED HIM WITH WISTFUL EYES ALMOST JEALOUS OF THE PRIVILEGE WHICH HIS KIND DEED WAS ABOUT TO BRING HIM HE FELT THAT HIS OWN HEART WAS IN HIS FRIEND'S BREAST THE MEMORY OF THAT MORNING WAS LIKE A DREAM TO ALL THOSE CONCERNED IN IT
4235-7633-0025 ADAM SALTON'S RECOLLECTION WAS OF AN ILLIMITABLE WAIT FILLED WITH ANXIETY HOPE AND CHAGRIN ALL DOMINATED BY A SENSE OF THE SLOW PASSAGE OF TIME AND ACCOMPANIED BY VAGUE FEARS MIMI COULD NOT FOR A LONG TIME THINK AT ALL OR RECOLLECT ANYTHING
4235-7633-0026 EXCEPT THAT ADAM LOVED HER AND WAS SAVING HER FROM A TERRIBLE DANGER WHEN SHE HAD TIME TO THINK LATER ON SHE WONDERED WHEN SHE HAD ANY IGNORANCE OF THE FACT THAT ADAM LOVED HER AND THAT SHE LOVED HIM WITH ALL HER HEART
4235-7633-0027 EVERYTHING EVERY RECOLLECTION HOWEVER SMALL EVERY FEELING SEEMED TO FIT INTO THOSE ELEMENTAL FACTS AS THOUGH THEY HAD ALL BEEN MOULDED TOGETHER THE MAIN AND CROWNING RECOLLECTION WAS HER SAYING GOODBYE TO SIR NATHANIEL AND ENTRUSTING TO HIM LOVING MESSAGES STRAIGHT FROM HER HEART TO ADAM SALTON
4235-7633-0028 AND OF HIS BEARING WHEN WITH AN IMPULSE WHICH SHE COULD NOT CHECK SHE PUT HER LIPS TO HIS AND KISSED HIM
4235-7633-0029 THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO BE SILENT FOR A TIME TO LILLA ON THE HAPPY EVENTS OF THAT STRANGE MISSION SHE HAD OF COURSE AGREED TO KEEP ALL SECRET UNTIL ADAM SHOULD GIVE HER LEAVE TO SPEAK
4235-7633-0030 THE ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE OF SIR NATHANIEL WAS A GREAT HELP TO ADAM IN CARRYING OUT HIS IDEA OF MARRYING MIMI WATFORD WITHOUT PUBLICITY HE WENT WITH HIM TO LONDON AND WITH HIS INFLUENCE THE YOUNG MAN OBTAINED THE LICENSE OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY FOR A PRIVATE MARRIAGE
4235-7633-0031 SIR NATHANIEL THEN PERSUADED OLD MISTER SALTON TO ALLOW HIS NEPHEW TO SPEND A FEW WEEKS WITH HIM AT DOOM TOWER AND IT WAS HERE THAT MIMI BECAME ADAM'S WIFE BUT THAT WAS ONLY THE FIRST STEP IN THEIR PLANS BEFORE GOING FURTHER HOWEVER ADAM TOOK HIS BRIDE OFF TO THE ISLE OF MAN
4235-7633-0032 HE WISHED TO PLACE A STRETCH OF SEA BETWEEN MIMI AND THE WHITE WORM WHILE THINGS MATURED ON THEIR RETURN SIR NATHANIEL MET THEM AND DROVE THEM AT ONCE TO DOOM TAKING CARE TO AVOID ANY ONE THAT HE KNEW ON THE JOURNEY SIR NATHANIEL HAD TAKEN CARE TO HAVE THE DOORS AND WINDOWS SHUT AND LOCKED
4235-7633-0033 ALL BUT THE DOOR USED FOR THEIR ENTRY THE SHUTTERS WERE UP AND THE BLINDS DOWN MOREOVER HEAVY CURTAINS WERE DRAWN ACROSS THE WINDOWS WHEN ADAM COMMENTED ON THIS SIR NATHANIEL SAID IN A WHISPER WAIT TILL WE ARE ALONE AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY THIS IS DONE
4235-7633-0034 DOOM TOWER WAS A LOFTY STRUCTURE SITUATED ON AN EMINENCE HIGH UP IN THE PEAK
4235-7633-0035 THE WINDOWS OF THE STUDY WERE BARRED AND LOCKED AND HEAVY DARK CURTAINS CLOSED THEM IN WHEN THIS WAS DONE NOT A GLEAM OF LIGHT FROM THE TOWER COULD BE SEEN FROM OUTSIDE WHEN THEY WERE ALONE SIR NATHANIEL EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD TAKEN HIS OLD FRIEND MISTER SALTON INTO FULL CONFIDENCE
4235-7633-0036 AND THAT IN FUTURE ALL WOULD WORK TOGETHER IT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT OUR MARRIAGE WAS KEPT SECRET AS ALSO YOUR TEMPORARY ABSENCE BOTH ARE KNOWN HOW TO WHOM
4235-7633-0037 HOW I KNOW NOT BUT I AM BEGINNING TO HAVE AN IDEA TO HER ASKED ADAM IN MOMENTARY CONSTERNATION SIR NATHANIEL SHIVERED PERCEPTIBLY THE WHITE WORM YES ADAM NOTICED THAT FROM NOW ON HIS FRIEND NEVER SPOKE OF LADY ARABELLA OTHERWISE
4235-7633-0038 EXCEPT WHEN HE WISHED TO DIVERT THE SUSPICION OF OTHERS SIR NATHANIEL SWITCHED OFF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT AND WHEN THE ROOM WAS PITCH DARK HE CAME TO ADAM TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND LED HIM TO A SEAT SET IN THE SOUTHERN WINDOW
4235-7633-0039 THEN HE SOFTLY DREW BACK A PIECE OF THE CURTAIN AND MOTIONED HIS COMPANION TO LOOK OUT ADAM DID SO AND IMMEDIATELY SHRANK BACK AS THOUGH HIS EYES HAD OPENED ON PRESSING DANGER HIS COMPANION SET HIS MIND AT REST BY SAYING IN A LOW VOICE IT IS ALL RIGHT YOU MAY SPEAK BUT SPEAK LOW
4235-7633-0040 THERE IS NO DANGER HERE AT PRESENT ADAM LEANED FORWARD TAKING CARE HOWEVER NOT TO PRESS HIS FACE AGAINST THE GLASS WHAT HE SAW WOULD NOT UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CAUSED CONCERN TO ANYBODY WITH HIS SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE IT WAS APPALLING
4235-7633-0041 THOUGH THE NIGHT WAS NOW SO DARK THAT IN REALITY THERE WAS LITTLE TO BE SEEN ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE TOWER STOOD A GROVE OF OLD TREES OF FOREST DIMENSIONS THEY WERE NOT GROUPED CLOSELY BUT STOOD A LITTLE APART FROM EACH OTHER PRODUCING THE EFFECT OF A ROW WIDELY PLANTED
4235-7633-0042 OVER THE TOPS OF THEM WAS SEEN A GREEN LIGHT SOMETHING LIKE THE DANGER SIGNAL AT A RAILWAY CROSSING IT SEEMED AT FIRST QUITE STILL BUT PRESENTLY WHEN ADAM'S EYE BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO IT HE COULD SEE THAT IT MOVED AS IF TREMBLING
4235-7633-0043 OOLANGA'S AWFUL SHRIEK AND THE HIDEOUS BLACK FACE NOW GROWN GREY WITH TERROR DISAPPEARING INTO THE IMPENETRABLE GLOOM OF THE MYSTERIOUS ORIFICE INSTINCTIVELY HE LAID HIS HAND ON HIS REVOLVER AND STOOD UP READY TO PROTECT HIS WIFE
4235-7633-0044 THEN SEEING THAT NOTHING HAPPENED AND THAT THE LIGHT AND ALL OUTSIDE THE TOWER REMAINED THE SAME HE SOFTLY PULLED THE CURTAIN OVER THE WINDOW
