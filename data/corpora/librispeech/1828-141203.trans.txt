1828-141203-0000 LIVINGSTONE'S OWN STORY OF HIS JOURNEYS HIS TROUBLES AND DISAPPOINTMENTS IF THERE IS LOVE BETWEEN US INCONCEIVABLY DELICIOUS AND PROFITABLE WILL OUR INTERCOURSE BE
1828-141203-0001 IF NOT YOUR TIME IS LOST AND YOU WILL ONLY ANNOY ME I SHALL SEEM TO YOU STUPID AND THE REPUTATION I HAVE FALSE ALL MY GOOD IS MAGNETIC AND I EDUCATE NOT BY LESSONS
1828-141203-0002 BUT BY GOING ABOUT MY BUSINESS
1828-141203-0003 EMERSON'S REPRESENTATIVE MEN I WOKE UP EARLY NEXT MORNING WITH A SUDDEN START THE ROOM WAS STRANGE IT WAS A HOUSE AND NOT MY TENT AH YES I RECOLLECTED
1828-141203-0004 I HAD DISCOVERED LIVINGSTONE AND I WAS IN HIS HOUSE I LISTENED THAT THE KNOWLEDGE DAWNING ON ME MIGHT BE CONFIRMED BY THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE I HEARD NOTHING BUT THE SULLEN ROAR OF THE SURF
1828-141203-0005 I LAY QUIETLY IN BED BED YES IT WAS A PRIMITIVE FOUR POSTER WITH THE LEAVES OF THE PALM TREE SPREAD UPON IT INSTEAD OF DOWN
1828-141203-0006 SERVING ME IN PLACE OF LINEN I BEGAN TO PUT MYSELF UNDER RIGID MENTAL CROSS EXAMINATION AND TO AN ANALYZATION OF MY POSITION WHAT WAS I SENT FOR TO FIND LIVINGSTONE
1828-141203-0007 HAVE YOU FOUND HIM YES OF COURSE AM I NOT IN HIS HOUSE WHOSE COMPASS IS THAT HANGING ON A PEG THERE WHOSE CLOTHES WHOSE BOOTS ARE THOSE WHO READS THOSE NEWSPAPERS THOSE SATURDAY REVIEWS
1828-141203-0008 AND NUMBERS OF PUNCH LYING ON THE FLOOR WELL
1828-141203-0009 I SHALL TELL HIM THIS MORNING WHO SENT ME AND WHAT BROUGHT ME HERE I WILL THEN ASK HIM TO WRITE A LETTER TO MISTER BENNETT AND TO GIVE WHAT NEWS HE CAN SPARE I DID NOT COME HERE TO ROB HIM OF HIS NEWS
1828-141203-0010 SUFFICIENT FOR ME IS IT THAT I HAVE FOUND HIM IT IS A COMPLETE SUCCESS SO FAR BUT IT WILL BE A GREATER ONE IF HE GIVES ME LETTERS FOR MISTER BENNETT AND AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT HE HAS SEEN ME DO YOU THINK HE WILL DO SO
1828-141203-0011 WHY NOT I HAVE COME HERE TO DO HIM A SERVICE HE HAS NO GOODS I HAVE HE HAS NO MEN WITH HIM I HAVE IF I DO A FRIENDLY PART BY HIM
1828-141203-0012 WILL HE NOT DO A FRIENDLY PART BY ME WHAT SAYS THE POET NOR HOPE TO FIND A FRIEND BUT WHO HAS FOUND A FRIEND IN THEE ALL LIKE THE PURCHASE FEW THE PRICE WILL PAY
1828-141203-0013 AND THIS MAKES FRIENDS SUCH WONDERS HERE BELOW I HAVE PAID THE PURCHASE BY COMING SO FAR TO DO HIM A SERVICE BUT I THINK FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN OF HIM LAST NIGHT THAT HE IS NOT SUCH A NIGGARD AND MISANTHROPE
1828-141203-0014 AS I WAS LED TO BELIEVE HE EXHIBITED CONSIDERABLE EMOTION DESPITE THE MONOSYLLABIC GREETING WHEN HE SHOOK MY HAND IF HE WERE A MAN TO FEEL ANNOYANCE AT ANY PERSON COMING AFTER HIM HE WOULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED ME AS HE DID
1828-141203-0015 NOR WOULD HE ASK ME TO LIVE WITH HIM BUT HE WOULD HAVE SURLILY REFUSED TO SEE ME AND TOLD ME TO MIND MY OWN BUSINESS NEITHER DOES HE MIND MY NATIONALITY FOR HERE SAID HE
1828-141203-0016 AMERICANS AND ENGLISHMEN ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WE SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE AND HAVE THE SAME IDEAS JUST SO DOCTOR I AGREE WITH YOU HERE AT LEAST AMERICANS AND ENGLISHMEN SHALL BE BROTHERS AND WHATEVER I CAN DO FOR YOU
1828-141203-0017 YOU MAY COMMAND ME FREELY I DRESSED MYSELF QUIETLY INTENDING TO TAKE A STROLL ALONG THE TANGANIKA BEFORE THE DOCTOR SHOULD RISE OPENED THE DOOR WHICH CREAKED HORRIBLY ON ITS HINGES
1828-141203-0018 AND WALKED OUT TO THE VERANDA HALLOA DOCTOR YOU UP ALREADY I HOPE YOU HAVE SLEPT WELL GOOD MORNING MISTER STANLEY
1828-141203-0019 I HOPE YOU RESTED WELL I SAT UP LATE READING MY LETTERS YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME GOOD AND BAD NEWS BUT SIT DOWN HE MADE A PLACE FOR ME BY HIS SIDE YES MANY OF MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD
1828-141203-0020 MY ELDEST SON HAS MET WITH A SAD ACCIDENT THAT IS MY BOY TOM MY SECOND SON OSWELL IS AT COLLEGE STUDYING MEDICINE AND IS DOING WELL I AM TOLD AGNES MY ELDEST DAUGHTER
1828-141203-0021 HAS BEEN ENJOYING HERSELF IN A YACHT WITH SIR PARAFFINE YOUNG AND HIS FAMILY SIR RODERICK ALSO IS WELL AND EXPRESSES A HOPE THAT HE WILL SOON SEE ME YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME QUITE A BUDGET
1828-141203-0022 THE MAN WAS NOT AN APPARITION THEN AND YESTERDAY'S SCENES WERE NOT THE RESULT OF A DREAM AND I GAZED ON HIM INTENTLY FOR THUS I WAS ASSURED HE HAD NOT RUN AWAY
1828-141203-0023 WHICH WAS THE GREAT FEAR THAT CONSTANTLY HAUNTED ME AS I WAS JOURNEYING TO UJIJI NOW DOCTOR SAID I YOU ARE PROBABLY WONDERING WHY I CAME HERE
1828-141203-0024 I THOUGHT YOU AT FIRST AN EMISSARY OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT
1828-141203-0025 WHO DIED A FEW MILES ABOVE GONDOKORO I HEARD YOU HAD BOATS PLENTY OF MEN AND STORES AND I REALLY BELIEVED YOU WERE SOME FRENCH OFFICER UNTIL I SAW THE AMERICAN FLAG AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH
1828-141203-0026 I WAS RATHER GLAD IT WAS SO BECAUSE I COULD NOT HAVE TALKED TO HIM IN FRENCH AND IF HE DID NOT KNOW ENGLISH WE HAD BEEN A PRETTY PAIR OF WHITE MEN IN UJIJI
1828-141203-0027 BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS NONE OF MY BUSINESS WELL SAID I LAUGHING FOR YOUR SAKE I AM GLAD THAT I AM AN AMERICAN AND NOT A FRENCHMAN AND THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER PERFECTLY WITHOUT AN INTERPRETER
1828-141203-0028 I SEE THAT THE ARABS ARE WONDERING THAT YOU AN ENGLISHMAN AND I AN AMERICAN UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER WE MUST TAKE CARE NOT TO TELL THEM THAT THE ENGLISH AND AMERICANS HAVE FOUGHT
1828-141203-0029 AND THAT THERE ARE ALABAMA CLAIMS LEFT UNSETTLED AND THAT WE HAVE SUCH PEOPLE AS FENIANS IN AMERICA WHO HATE YOU BUT SERIOUSLY DOCTOR NOW DON'T BE FRIGHTENED WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I HAVE COME AFTER YOU
1828-141203-0030 AFTER ME YES HOW WELL YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE NEW YORK HERALD OH WHO HAS NOT HEARD OF THAT NEWSPAPER
1828-141203-0031 WITHOUT HIS FATHER'S KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT MISTER JAMES GORDON BENNETT SON OF MISTER JAMES GORDON BENNETT THE PROPRIETOR OF THE HERALD HAS COMMISSIONED ME TO FIND YOU TO GET WHATEVER NEWS OF YOUR DISCOVERIES YOU LIKE TO GIVE AND TO ASSIST YOU
1828-141203-0032 IF I CAN WITH MEANS YOUNG MISTER BENNETT TOLD YOU TO COME AFTER ME TO FIND ME OUT AND HELP ME IT IS NO WONDER THEN YOU PRAISED MISTER BENNETT SO MUCH LAST NIGHT I KNOW HIM I AM PROUD TO SAY
1828-141203-0033 TO BE JUST WHAT I SAY HE IS HE IS AN ARDENT GENEROUS AND TRUE MAN WELL INDEED I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM AND IT MAKES ME FEEL PROUD TO THINK THAT YOU AMERICANS THINK SO MUCH OF ME
1828-141203-0034 YOU HAVE JUST COME IN THE PROPER TIME FOR I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO BEG FROM THE ARABS EVEN THEY ARE IN WANT OF CLOTH AND THERE ARE BUT FEW BEADS IN UJIJI
1828-141203-0035 I WISH I COULD EMBODY MY THANKS TO MISTER BENNETT IN SUITABLE WORDS BUT IF I FAIL TO DO SO DO NOT I BEG OF YOU BELIEVE ME THE LESS GRATEFUL AND NOW DOCTOR HAVING DISPOSED OF THIS LITTLE AFFAIR FERAJJI
1828-141203-0036 SHALL BRING BREAKFAST IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION YOU HAVE GIVEN ME AN APPETITE HE SAID HALIMAH IS MY COOK
1828-141203-0037 TEA AND COFFEE FERAJJI THE COOK WAS READY AS USUAL WITH EXCELLENT TEA AND A DISH OF SMOKING CAKES DAMPERS AS THE DOCTOR CALLED THEM
1828-141203-0038 BUT THEY WERE NECESSARY TO THE DOCTOR WHO HAD NEARLY LOST ALL HIS TEETH FROM THE HARD FARE OF LUNDA HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO SUBSIST ON GREEN EARS OF INDIAN CORN THERE WAS NO MEAT IN THAT DISTRICT
1828-141203-0039 AND THE EFFORT TO GNAW AT THE CORN EARS HAD LOOSENED ALL HIS TEETH I PREFERRED THE CORN SCONES OF VIRGINIA WHICH TO MY MIND WERE THE NEAREST APPROACH TO PALATABLE BREAD OBTAINABLE IN CENTRAL AFRICA
1828-141203-0040 THE DOCTOR SAID HE HAD THOUGHT ME A MOST LUXURIOUS AND RICH MAN WHEN HE SAW MY GREAT BATH TUB CARRIED ON THE SHOULDERS OF ONE OF MY MEN BUT HE THOUGHT ME STILL MORE LUXURIOUS THIS MORNING WHEN MY KNIVES AND FORKS
1828-141203-0041 AND PLATES AND CUPS SAUCERS SILVER SPOONS AND SILVER TEAPOT WERE BROUGHT FORTH SHINING AND BRIGHT SPREAD ON A RICH PERSIAN CARPET AND OBSERVED THAT I WAS WELL ATTENDED TO BY MY YELLOW AND EBON MERCURIES
1828-141203-0042 THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF OUR LIFE AT UJIJI I KNEW HIM NOT AS A FRIEND BEFORE MY ARRIVAL HE WAS ONLY AN OBJECT TO ME A GREAT ITEM FOR A DAILY NEWSPAPER
1828-141203-0043 AS MUCH AS OTHER SUBJECTS IN WHICH THE VORACIOUS NEWS LOVING PUBLIC DELIGHT IN
1828-141203-0044 STOOD CLOSE TO THE CONDEMNED MURDERER TO RECORD HIS LAST STRUGGLES AND LAST SIGHS BUT NEVER HAD I BEEN CALLED TO RECORD ANYTHING THAT MOVED ME SO MUCH AS THIS MAN'S WOES AND SUFFERINGS
1828-141203-0045 HIS PRIVATIONS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS WHICH NOW WERE POURED INTO MY EAR VERILY DID I BEGIN TO PERCEIVE THAT THE GODS ABOVE DO WITH JUST EYES SURVEY THE AFFAIRS OF MEN
1828-141203-0046 I BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE THE HAND OF AN OVERRULING AND KINDLY PROVIDENCE THE FOLLOWING ARE SINGULAR FACTS WORTHY FOR REFLECTION
1828-141203-0047 I WAS COMMISSIONED FOR THE DUTY OF DISCOVERING LIVINGSTONE SOMETIME IN OCTOBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE MISTER BENNETT WAS READY WITH THE MONEY AND I WAS READY FOR THE JOURNEY BUT OBSERVE READER
1828-141203-0048 THAT I DID NOT PROCEED DIRECTLY UPON THE SEARCH MISSION I HAD MANY TASKS TO FULFIL BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH IT AND MANY THOUSAND MILES TO TRAVEL OVER SUPPOSING THAT I HAD GONE DIRECT TO ZANZIBAR FROM PARIS
1828-141203-0049 SEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS AFTERWARDS PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE FOUND MYSELF AT UJIJI BUT LIVINGSTONE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND THERE THEN HE WAS ON THE LUALABA
1828-141203-0050 THE TIME TAKEN BY ME IN TRAVELLING UP THE NILE BACK TO JERUSALEM THEN TO CONSTANTINOPLE SOUTHERN RUSSIA THE CAUCASUS AND PERSIA WAS EMPLOYED BY LIVINGSTONE IN FRUITFUL DISCOVERIES WEST OF THE TANGANIKA AGAIN
1828-141203-0051 IN THE LATTER PART OF JUNE
1828-141203-0052 LEADING A FRETFUL PEEVISH AND IMPATIENT LIFE BUT WHILE I WAS THUS FRETTING MYSELF AND BEING DELAYED BY A SERIES OF ACCIDENTS LIVINGSTONE WAS BEING FORCED BACK TO UJIJI IN THE SAME MONTH
1828-141203-0053 IT TOOK HIM FROM JUNE TO OCTOBER TO MARCH TO UJIJI NOW IN SEPTEMBER I BROKE LOOSE FROM THE THRALDOM WHICH ACCIDENT HAD IMPOSED ON ME AND HURRIED SOUTHWARD TO UKONONGO
1828-141203-0054 THEN WESTWARD TO KAWENDI THEN NORTHWARD TO UVINZA THEN WESTWARD TO UJIJI ONLY ABOUT THREE WEEKS AFTER THE DOCTOR'S ARRIVAL TO FIND HIM RESTING UNDER THE VERANDA OF HIS HOUSE
1828-141203-0055 WITH HIS FACE TURNED EASTWARD THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH I WAS COMING HAD I GONE DIRECT FROM PARIS ON THE SEARCH I MIGHT HAVE LOST HIM
1828-141203-0056 MY COMPANION WAS IMPROVING IN HEALTH AND SPIRITS LIFE HAD BEEN BROUGHT BACK TO HIM HIS FADING VITALITY WAS RESTORED HIS ENTHUSIASM FOR HIS WORK WAS GROWING UP AGAIN INTO A HEIGHT THAT WAS COMPELLING HIM TO DESIRE TO BE UP AND DOING
1828-141203-0057 BUT WHAT COULD HE DO WITH FIVE MEN AND FIFTEEN OR TWENTY CLOTHS
1828-141203-0058 NO I DID TRY TO GO THERE
1828-141203-0059 AS THEY DID BOTH BURTON AND SPEKE AND I HAD NOT A GREAT DEAL OF CLOTH IF I HAD GONE TO THE HEAD OF THE TANGANIKA I COULD NOT HAVE GONE TO MANYUEMA THE CENTRAL LINE OF DRAINAGE WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT
1828-141203-0060 AND THAT IS THE LUALABA BEFORE THIS LINE THE QUESTION WHETHER THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TANGANIKA AND THE ALBERT N'YANZA SINKS INTO INSIGNIFICANCE THE GREAT LINE OF DRAINAGE
1828-141203-0061 IS THE RIVER FLOWING FROM LATITUDE ELEVEN DEGREES SOUTH WHICH I FOLLOWED FOR OVER SEVEN DEGREES NORTHWARD
1828-141203-0062 THE NAME GIVEN TO ITS MOST SOUTHERN EXTREMITY DRAINS A LARGE TRACT OF COUNTRY SOUTH OF THE SOUTHERNMOST SOURCE OF THE TANGANIKA IT MUST THEREFORE BE THE MOST IMPORTANT I HAVE NOT THE LEAST DOUBT MYSELF
1828-141203-0063 BUT THAT THIS LAKE IS THE UPPER TANGANIKA AND THE ALBERT N'YANZA OF BAKER IS THE LOWER TANGANIKA
1828-141203-0064 THIS IS MY BELIEF BASED UPON REPORTS OF THE ARABS AND A TEST I MADE OF THE FLOW WITH WATER PLANTS BUT
1828-141203-0065 MUCH THOUGHT WELL IF I WERE YOU DOCTOR BEFORE LEAVING UJIJI I SHOULD EXPLORE IT AND RESOLVE THE DOUBTS UPON THE SUBJECT LEST AFTER YOU LEAVE HERE YOU SHOULD NOT RETURN BY THIS WAY
1828-141203-0066 THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY ATTACH MUCH IMPORTANCE TO THIS SUPPOSED CONNECTION AND DECLARE YOU ARE THE ONLY MAN WHO CAN SETTLE IT IF I CAN BE OF ANY SERVICE TO YOU YOU MAY COMMAND ME THOUGH I DID NOT COME TO AFRICA AS AN EXPLORER
1828-141203-0067 I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF CURIOSITY UPON THE SUBJECT AND SHOULD BE WILLING TO ACCOMPANY YOU I HAVE WITH ME ABOUT TWENTY MEN WHO UNDERSTAND ROWING WE HAVE PLENTY OF GUNS CLOTH AND BEADS AND IF WE CAN GET A CANOE FROM THE ARABS WE CAN MANAGE THE THING EASILY
1828-141203-0068 OH WE CAN GET A CANOE FROM SAYD BIN MAJID THIS MAN HAS BEEN VERY KIND TO ME AND IF EVER THERE WAS AN ARAB GENTLEMAN HE IS ONE THEN IT IS SETTLED IS IT THAT WE GO I AM READY
1828-141203-0069 WHENEVER YOU ARE I AM AT YOUR COMMAND DON'T YOU HEAR MY MEN CALL YOU THE GREAT MASTER AND ME THE LITTLE MASTER IT WOULD NEVER DO FOR THE LITTLE MASTER TO COMMAND BY THIS TIME
1828-141203-0070 LIVINGSTONE WAS BECOMING KNOWN TO ME I DEFY ANY ONE TO BE IN HIS SOCIETY LONG WITHOUT THOROUGHLY FATHOMING HIM FOR IN HIM THERE IS NO GUILE AND WHAT IS APPARENT ON THE SURFACE IS THE THING THAT IS IN HIM
1828-141203-0071 I SIMPLY WRITE DOWN MY OWN OPINION OF THE MAN AS I HAVE SEEN HIM NOT AS HE REPRESENTS HIMSELF AS I KNOW HIM TO BE NOT AS I HAVE HEARD OF HIM I LIVED WITH HIM FROM THE TENTH NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE
1828-141203-0072 WITNESSED HIS CONDUCT IN THE CAMP AND ON THE MARCH AND MY FEELINGS FOR HIM ARE THOSE OF UNQUALIFIED ADMIRATION
1828-141203-0073 IF HE IS FLIGHTY OR WRONG HEADED HE IS SURE TO DEVELOP HIS HOBBIES AND WEAK SIDE I THINK IT POSSIBLE HOWEVER THAT LIVINGSTONE WITH AN UNSUITABLE COMPANION MIGHT FEEL ANNOYANCE I KNOW I SHOULD DO SO VERY READILY
1828-141203-0074 IF A MAN'S CHARACTER WAS OF THAT OBLIQUE NATURE THAT IT WAS AN IMPOSSIBILITY TO TRAVEL IN HIS COMPANY I HAVE SEEN MEN IN WHOSE COMPANY I FELT NOTHING BUT A THRALDOM
1828-141203-0075 WHICH IT WAS A DUTY TO MY OWN SELF RESPECT TO CAST OFF AS SOON AS POSSIBLE A FEELING OF UTTER INCOMPATIBILITY WITH WHOSE NATURE MINE COULD NEVER ASSIMILATE BUT LIVINGSTONE WAS A CHARACTER THAT I VENERATED
1828-141203-0076 THAT CALLED FORTH ALL MY ENTHUSIASM THAT EVOKED NOTHING BUT SINCEREST ADMIRATION DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE IS ABOUT SIXTY YEARS OLD THOUGH AFTER HE WAS RESTORED TO HEALTH
1828-141203-0077 HE APPEARED MORE LIKE A MAN WHO HAD NOT PASSED HIS FIFTIETH YEAR HIS HAIR HAS A BROWNISH COLOUR YET BUT IS HERE AND THERE STREAKED WITH GREY LINES OVER THE TEMPLES
1828-141203-0078 HE SHAVES HIS CHIN DAILY HIS EYES WHICH ARE HAZEL ARE REMARKABLY BRIGHT HE HAS A SIGHT KEEN AS A HAWK'S HIS TEETH ALONE INDICATE THE WEAKNESS OF AGE THE HARD FARE OF LUNDA HAS MADE HAVOC IN THEIR LINES
1828-141203-0079 HIS FORM WHICH SOON ASSUMED A STOUTISH APPEARANCE IS A LITTLE OVER THE ORDINARY HEIGHT WITH THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBLE BOW IN THE SHOULDERS WHEN WALKING HE HAS A FIRM BUT HEAVY TREAD LIKE THAT OF AN OVERWORKED OR FATIGUED MAN
1828-141203-0080 HE IS ACCUSTOMED TO WEAR A NAVAL CAP WITH A SEMICIRCULAR PEAK BY WHICH HE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED THROUGHOUT AFRICA HIS DRESS WHEN FIRST I SAW HIM EXHIBITED TRACES OF PATCHING AND REPAIRING BUT WAS SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN
1828-141203-0081 I WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT LIVINGSTONE POSSESSED A SPLENETIC MISANTHROPIC TEMPER SOME HAVE SAID THAT HE IS GARRULOUS THAT HE IS DEMENTED THAT HE HAS UTTERLY CHANGED FROM THE DAVID LIVINGSTONE WHOM PEOPLE KNEW AS THE REVEREND MISSIONARY
1828-141203-0082 THAT HE TAKES NO NOTES OR OBSERVATIONS BUT SUCH AS THOSE WHICH NO OTHER PERSON COULD READ BUT HIMSELF AND IT WAS REPORTED BEFORE I PROCEEDED TO CENTRAL AFRICA THAT HE WAS MARRIED TO AN AFRICAN PRINCESS I RESPECTFULLY
1828-141203-0083 BEG TO DIFFER WITH ALL AND EACH OF THE ABOVE STATEMENTS I GRANT HE IS NOT AN ANGEL BUT HE APPROACHES TO THAT BEING AS NEAR AS THE NATURE OF A LIVING MAN WILL ALLOW I NEVER SAW ANY SPLEEN OR MISANTHROPY IN HIM
1828-141203-0084 AS FOR BEING GARRULOUS DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE IS QUITE THE REVERSE HE IS RESERVED IF ANYTHING AND TO THE MAN WHO SAYS DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE IS CHANGED ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT HE NEVER COULD HAVE KNOWN HIM
1828-141203-0085 FOR IT IS NOTORIOUS THAT THE DOCTOR HAS A FUND OF QUIET HUMOUR WHICH HE EXHIBITS AT ALL TIMES WHENEVER HE IS AMONG FRIENDS I MUST ALSO BEG LEAVE TO CORRECT THE GENTLEMAN WHO INFORMED ME THAT LIVINGSTONE TAKES NO NOTES OR OBSERVATIONS
1828-141203-0086 THE HUGE LETTS'S DIARY WHICH I CARRIED HOME TO HIS DAUGHTER IS FULL OF NOTES AND THERE ARE NO LESS THAN A SCORE OF SHEETS WITHIN IT FILLED WITH OBSERVATIONS WHICH HE TOOK DURING THE LAST TRIP HE MADE TO MANYUEMA ALONE
1828-141203-0087 AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOOK THERE IS SHEET AFTER SHEET COLUMN AFTER COLUMN CAREFULLY WRITTEN OF FIGURES ALONE A LARGE LETTER WHICH I RECEIVED FROM HIM HAS BEEN SENT TO SIR THOMAS MAC LEAR AND THIS CONTAINS NOTHING BUT OBSERVATIONS
1828-141203-0088 DURING THE FOUR MONTHS I WAS WITH HIM I NOTICED HIM EVERY EVENING MAKING MOST CAREFUL NOTES AND A LARGE TIN BOX THAT HE HAS WITH HIM CONTAINS NUMBERS OF FIELD NOTE BOOKS THE CONTENTS OF WHICH I DARE SAY WILL SEE THE LIGHT SOME TIME
1828-141203-0089 HIS MAPS ALSO EVINCE GREAT CARE AND INDUSTRY AS TO THE REPORT OF HIS AFRICAN MARRIAGE IT IS UNNECESSARY TO SAY MORE THAN THAT IT IS UNTRUE AND IT IS UTTERLY BENEATH A GENTLEMAN
1828-141203-0090 TO HINT AT SUCH A THING IN CONNECTION WITH THE NAME OF DAVID LIVINGSTONE THERE IS A GOOD NATURED ABANDON ABOUT LIVINGSTONE WHICH WAS NOT LOST ON ME WHENEVER HE BEGAN TO LAUGH THERE WAS A CONTAGION ABOUT IT THAT COMPELLED ME TO IMITATE HIM
1828-141203-0091 IT WAS SUCH A LAUGH AS HERR TEUFELSDROCKH'S A LAUGH OF THE WHOLE MAN FROM HEAD TO HEEL IF HE TOLD A STORY HE RELATED IT IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CONVINCE ONE OF ITS TRUTHFULNESS HIS FACE WAS SO
1828-141203-0092 LIT UP BY THE SLY FUN IT CONTAINED THAT I WAS SURE THE STORY WAS WORTH RELATING AND WORTH LISTENING TO
1828-141203-0093 THE HEAVY STEP WHICH TOLD OF AGE AND HARD TRAVEL THE GREY BEARD AND BOWED SHOULDERS BELIED THE MAN UNDERNEATH THAT WELL WORN EXTERIOR LAY AN ENDLESS FUND OF HIGH SPIRITS AND INEXHAUSTIBLE HUMOUR
1828-141203-0094 THAT RUGGED FRAME OF HIS ENCLOSED A YOUNG AND MOST EXUBERANT SOUL EVERY DAY I HEARD INNUMERABLE JOKES AND PLEASANT ANECDOTES INTERESTING HUNTING STORIES IN WHICH HIS FRIENDS OSWELL WEBB VARDON AND GORDEN CUMMING
1828-141203-0095 WERE ALMOST ALWAYS THE CHIEF ACTORS I WAS NOT SURE AT FIRST BUT THIS JOVIALITY HUMOUR AND ABUNDANT ANIMAL SPIRITS WERE THE RESULT OF A JOYOUS HYSTERIA BUT AS I FOUND THEY CONTINUED WHILE I WAS WITH HIM
1828-141203-0096 I AM OBLIGED TO THINK THEM NATURAL ANOTHER THING WHICH SPECIALLY ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION WAS HIS WONDERFULLY RETENTIVE MEMORY IF WE REMEMBER THE MANY YEARS HE HAS SPENT IN AFRICA DEPRIVED OF BOOKS
1828-141203-0097 WE MAY WELL THINK IT AN UNCOMMON MEMORY THAT CAN RECITE WHOLE POEMS FROM BYRON BURNS TENNYSON LONGFELLOW WHITTIER AND LOWELL THE REASON OF THIS MAY BE FOUND PERHAPS
1828-141203-0098 WITHIN HIMSELF ZIMMERMAN A GREAT STUDENT OF HUMAN NATURE SAYS ON THIS SUBJECT THE UNENCUMBERED MIND RECALLS ALL THAT IT HAS READ ALL THAT PLEASED THE EYE AND DELIGHTED THE EAR
1828-141203-0099 AND REFLECTING ON EVERY IDEA WHICH EITHER OBSERVATION OR EXPERIENCE OR DISCOURSE HAS PRODUCED GAINS NEW INFORMATION BY EVERY REFLECTION THE INTELLECT CONTEMPLATES ALL THE FORMER SCENES OF LIFE
1828-141203-0100 VIEWS BY ANTICIPATION THOSE THAT ARE YET TO COME AND BLENDS ALL IDEAS OF PAST AND FUTURE IN THE ACTUAL ENJOYMENT OF THE PRESENT MOMENT HE HAS LIVED IN A WORLD WHICH REVOLVED INWARDLY
1828-141203-0101 OUT OF WHICH HE SELDOM AWOKE EXCEPT TO ATTEND TO THE IMMEDIATE PRACTICAL NECESSITIES OF HIMSELF AND PEOPLE THEN RELAPSED AGAIN INTO THE SAME HAPPY INNER WORLD WHICH HE MUST HAVE PEOPLED WITH HIS OWN FRIENDS RELATIONS ACQUAINTANCES
1828-141203-0102 FAMILIAR READINGS IDEAS AND ASSOCIATIONS SO THAT WHEREVER HE MIGHT BE OR BY WHATSOEVER HE WAS SURROUNDED HIS OWN WORLD ALWAYS POSSESSED MORE ATTRACTIONS TO HIS CULTURED MIND
1828-141203-0103 THAN WERE YIELDED BY EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE STUDY OF DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE WOULD NOT BE COMPLETE IF WE DID NOT TAKE THE RELIGIOUS SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER INTO CONSIDERATION HIS RELIGION IS NOT OF THE THEORETICAL KIND
1828-141203-0104 BUT IT IS A CONSTANT EARNEST SINCERE PRACTICE IT IS NEITHER DEMONSTRATIVE NOR LOUD BUT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN A QUIET PRACTICAL WAY AND IS ALWAYS AT WORK IT IS NOT AGGRESSIVE
1828-141203-0105 WHICH SOMETIMES IS TROUBLESOME IF NOT IMPERTINENT IN HIM RELIGION EXHIBITS ITS LOVELIEST FEATURES IT GOVERNS HIS CONDUCT NOT ONLY TOWARDS HIS SERVANTS BUT TOWARDS THE NATIVES
1828-141203-0106 THE BIGOTED MOHAMMEDANS AND ALL WHO COME IN CONTACT WITH HIM WITHOUT IT LIVINGSTONE WITH HIS ARDENT TEMPERAMENT HIS ENTHUSIASM HIS HIGH SPIRIT AND COURAGE MUST HAVE BECOME UNCOMPANIONABLE AND A HARD MASTER
1828-141203-0107 RELIGION HAS TAMED HIM AND MADE HIM A CHRISTIAN GENTLEMAN THE CRUDE AND WILFUL HAVE BEEN REFINED AND SUBDUED RELIGION HAS MADE HIM THE MOST COMPANIONABLE OF MEN
1828-141203-0108 AND INDULGENT OF MASTERS A MAN WHOSE SOCIETY IS PLEASURABLE IN LIVINGSTONE I HAVE SEEN MANY AMIABLE TRAITS HIS GENTLENESS NEVER FORSAKES HIM HIS HOPEFULNESS NEVER DESERTS HIM
1828-141203-0109 NO HARASSING ANXIETIES DISTRACTION OF MIND LONG SEPARATION FROM HOME AND KINDRED CAN MAKE HIM COMPLAIN HE THINKS ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT AT LAST HE HAS SUCH FAITH IN THE GOODNESS OF PROVIDENCE
1828-141203-0110 THE SPORT OF ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE PLAYTHING OF THE MISERABLE BEINGS SENT TO HIM FROM ZANZIBAR HE HAS BEEN BAFFLED AND WORRIED EVEN ALMOST TO THE GRAVE YET HE WILL NOT DESERT THE CHARGE IMPOSED UPON HIM BY HIS FRIEND
1828-141203-0111 SIR RODERICK MURCHISON TO THE STERN DICTATES OF DUTY ALONE HAS HE SACRIFICED HIS HOME AND EASE THE PLEASURES REFINEMENTS AND LUXURIES OF CIVILIZED LIFE HIS IS THE SPARTAN HEROISM
1828-141203-0112 THE INFLEXIBILITY OF THE ROMAN THE ENDURING RESOLUTION OF THE ANGLO SAXON NEVER TO RELINQUISH HIS WORK THOUGH HIS HEART YEARNS FOR HOME NEVER TO SURRENDER HIS OBLIGATIONS UNTIL HE CAN WRITE
1828-141203-0113 TO HIS WORK BUT YOU MAY TAKE ANY POINT IN DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE'S CHARACTER
1828-141203-0114 AND I WOULD CHALLENGE ANY MAN TO FIND A FAULT IN IT HE IS SENSITIVE I KNOW BUT SO IS ANY MAN OF A HIGH MIND AND GENEROUS NATURE HE IS SENSITIVE ON THE POINT OF BEING DOUBTED OR BEING CRITICISED AN EXTREME LOVE OF TRUTH IS ONE OF HIS STRONGEST CHARACTERISTICS
1828-141203-0115 WHICH PROVES HIM TO BE A MAN OF STRICTEST PRINCIPLES AND CONSCIENTIOUS SCRUPLES BEING SUCH HE IS NATURALLY SENSITIVE AND SHRINKS FROM ANY ATTACKS ON THE INTEGRITY OF HIS OBSERVATIONS AND THE ACCURACY OF HIS REPORTS
1828-141203-0116 TO HAVE BEEN PAINSTAKING AND AS EXACT AS CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD ALLOW ORDINARY CRITICS SELDOM TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION CIRCUMSTANCES BUT
1828-141203-0117 UTTERLY REGARDLESS OF THE LABOR EXPENDED IN OBTAINING THE LEAST AMOUNT OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION IN A NEW LAND ENVIRONED BY INCONCEIVABLE DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES SUCH AS CENTRAL AFRICA PRESENTS THEY SEEM TO TAKE DELIGHT IN RENDING TO TATTERS
1828-141203-0118 AND REDUCING TO NIL THE FRUITS OF LONG YEARS OF LABOR BY SHARPLY POINTED SHAFTS OF RIDICULE AND SNEERS
1828-141203-0119 LIVINGSTONE NO DOUBT MAY BE MISTAKEN IN SOME OF HIS CONCLUSIONS ABOUT CERTAIN POINTS IN THE GEOGRAPHY OF CENTRAL AFRICA BUT HE IS NOT SO DOGMATIC AND POSITIVE A MAN AS TO REFUSE CONVICTION
1828-141203-0120 HE CERTAINLY DEMANDS WHEN ARGUMENTS IN CONTRA ARE USED IN OPPOSITION TO HIM HIGHER AUTHORITY THAN ABSTRACT THEORY HIS WHOLE LIFE IS A TESTIMONY AGAINST ITS UNRELIABILITY
1828-141203-0121 AND HIS ENTIRE LABOR OF YEARS WERE IN VAIN IF THEORY CAN BE TAKEN IN EVIDENCE AGAINST PERSONAL OBSERVATION AND PATIENT INVESTIGATION THE RELUCTANCE HE MANIFESTS TO ENTERTAIN SUPPOSITIONS
1828-141203-0122 POSSIBILITIES REGARDING THE NATURE FORM CONFIGURATION OF CONCRETE IMMUTABLE MATTER LIKE THE EARTH ARISES FROM THE FACT THAT A MAN WHO COMMITS HIMSELF TO THEORIES ABOUT SUCH AN UNTHEORETICAL SUBJECT AS CENTRAL AFRICA
1828-141203-0123 IS DETERRED FROM BESTIRRING HIMSELF TO PROVE THEM BY THE TEST OF EXPLORATION HIS OPINION OF SUCH A MAN IS THAT HE UNFITS HIMSELF FOR HIS DUTY
1828-141203-0124 THAT HE IS VERY LIKELY TO BECOME A SLAVE TO THEORY A VOLUPTUOUS FANCY WHICH WOULD MASTER HIM IT IS HIS FIRM BELIEF THAT A MAN WHO RESTS HIS SOLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GEOGRAPHY OF AFRICA ON THEORY
1828-141203-0125 DESERVES TO BE DISCREDITED IT HAS BEEN THE FEAR OF BEING DISCREDITED AND CRITICISED AND SO MADE TO APPEAR BEFORE THE WORLD AS A MAN WHO SPENT SO MANY VALUABLE YEARS IN AFRICA FOR THE SAKE OF BURDENING THE GEOGRAPHICAL MIND WITH THEORY
1828-141203-0126 THAT HAS DETAINED HIM SO LONG IN AFRICA DOING HIS UTMOST TO TEST THE VALUE OF THE MAIN THEORY WHICH CLUNG TO HIM AND WOULD CLING TO HIM UNTIL HE PROVED OR DISPROVED IT THIS MAIN THEORY
1828-141203-0127 IS HIS BELIEF THAT IN THE BROAD AND MIGHTY LUALABA HE HAS DISCOVERED THE HEAD WATERS OF THE NILE
1828-141203-0128 HIS GROUNDS FOR BELIEVING THIS ARE OF SUCH NATURE AND WEIGHT AS TO COMPEL HIM TO DESPISE THE WARNING THAT YEARS ARE ADVANCING ON HIM AND HIS FORMER IRON CONSTITUTION IS FAILING
1828-141203-0129 HE BELIEVES HIS SPECULATIONS ON THIS POINT WILL BE VERIFIED HE BELIEVES HE IS STRONG ENOUGH TO PURSUE HIS EXPLORATIONS UNTIL HE CAN RETURN TO HIS COUNTRY WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE LUALABA IS NONE OTHER
