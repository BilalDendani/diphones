4260-176854-0000 THERE WAS ANOTHER CAUSE WHICH GREATLY CONTRIBUTED TO DIMINISH THE POWER AS WELL AS THE PRESTIGE OF THIS ECCENTRIC SOVEREIGN
4260-176854-0001 WHICH RAISED AN OUTCRY AMONGST THESE SECTIONS OF THEIR COMMUNITY THE ARCHISUPPOTS AND THE CAGOUX AT FIRST DECLINED SUCH AN ALLIANCE BUT EVENTUALLY THEY WERE OBLIGED TO ADMIT ALL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE WOOD THIEVES WHO WERE ALTOGETHER EXCLUDED
4260-176854-0002 IT WAS NECESSARY NOT ONLY TO SOLICIT ALMS LIKE ANY MERE BEGGAR BUT ALSO TO POSSESS THE DEXTERITY OF THE CUT PURSE AND THE THIEF THESE ARTS WERE TO BE LEARNED IN THE PLACES WHICH SERVED AS THE HABITUAL RENDEZVOUS OF THE VERY DREGS OF SOCIETY
4260-176854-0003 AND WHICH WERE GENERALLY KNOWN AS THE COURS DES MIRACLES THESE HOUSES OR RATHER RESORTS HAD BEEN SO CALLED IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE A WRITER OF THE EARLY PART OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
4260-176854-0004 TO GET THERE ONE MUST WANDER THROUGH NARROW CLOSE AND BY STREETS AND IN ORDER TO ENTER IT ONE MUST DESCEND A SOMEWHAT WINDING AND RUGGED DECLIVITY
4260-176854-0005 IN THIS PLACE I FOUND A MUD HOUSE HALF BURIED VERY SHAKY FROM OLD AGE AND ROTTENNESS AND ONLY EIGHT METRES SQUARE BUT IN WHICH NEVERTHELESS SOME FIFTY FAMILIES ARE LIVING
4260-176854-0006 WHO HAVE THE CHARGE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF CHILDREN MANY OF WHOM ARE STOLEN OR ILLEGITIMATE I WAS ASSURED THAT UPWARDS OF FIVE HUNDRED LARGE FAMILIES OCCUPY THAT AND OTHER HOUSES ADJOINING LARGE AS THIS COURT IS IT WAS FORMERLY EVEN BIGGER
4260-176854-0007 EVERY ONE ENJOYS THE PRESENT AND EATS IN THE EVENING WHAT HE HAS EARNED DURING THE DAY WITH SO MUCH TROUBLE AND OFTEN WITH SO MANY BLOWS FOR IT IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RULES OF THE COUR DES MIRACLES NEVER TO LAY BY ANYTHING FOR THE MORROW
4260-176854-0008 EVERY ONE WHO LIVES THERE INDULGES IN THE UTMOST LICENTIOUSNESS BOTH RELIGION AND LAW ARE UTTERLY IGNORED IT IS TRUE THAT OUTWARDLY THEY APPEAR TO ACKNOWLEDGE A GOD FOR THEY HAVE SET UP
4260-176854-0009 IN A NICHE AN IMAGE OF GOD THE FATHER WHICH THEY HAVE STOLEN FROM SOME CHURCH AND BEFORE WHICH THEY COME DAILY TO OFFER UP CERTAIN PRAYERS BUT THIS IS ONLY BECAUSE THEY SUPERSTITIOUSLY IMAGINE
4260-176854-0010 THAT BY THIS MEANS THEY ARE RELEASED FROM THE NECESSITY OF PERFORMING THE DUTIES OF CHRISTIANS TO THEIR PASTOR AND THEIR PARISH AND ARE EVEN ABSOLVED FROM THE SIN OF ENTERING A CHURCH FOR THE PURPOSE OF ROBBERY AND PURSE CUTTING
4260-176854-0011 PARIS THE CAPITAL OF THE KINGDOM OF ROGUES WAS NOT THE ONLY TOWN WHICH POSSESSED A COUR DES MIRACLES
4260-176854-0012 SOME TRACES OF THESE PRIVILEGED RESORTS OF ROGUES AND THIEVES
4260-176854-0013 SAUVAL STATES ON THE TESTIMONY OF PEOPLE WORTHY OF CREDIT THAT AT SAINTE ANNE D'AURAY THE MOST HOLY PLACE OF PILGRIMAGE IN BRITTANY
4260-176854-0014 THIS WAS COVERED WITH MUD HUTS AND HERE
4260-176854-0015 THAT IS TO SAY IN ORDER TO SETTLE AND ARRANGE RESPECTING ROBBERY AT THESE STATE MEETINGS WHICH WERE NOT ALWAYS HELD AT SAINTE ANNE D'AURAY
4260-176854-0016 SOME CAME AND PAID HIM THE TRIBUTE WHICH WAS REQUIRED OF THEM BY THE STATUTES OF THE CRAFT OTHERS RENDERED HIM AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT THEY HAD DONE AND WHAT THEY HAD EARNED DURING THE YEAR WHEN THEY HAD EXECUTED THEIR WORK BADLY
4260-176854-0017 HE ORDERED THEM TO BE PUNISHED EITHER CORPORALLY OR PECUNIARILY
4260-176854-0018 WHICH IS STILL IN USE UNDER THE NAME OF ARGOT OR
4260-176854-0019 HAD FOR THE MOST PART BEEN BORROWED FROM THE JARGON OR SLANG OF THE LOWER ORDERS TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT ACCORDING TO THE LEARNED PHILOLOGIST OF THIS MYSTERIOUS LANGUAGE
4260-176854-0020 IT WAS COMPOSED OF FRENCH WORDS LENGTHENED OR ABBREVIATED OF PROVERBIAL EXPRESSIONS OF WORDS EXPRESSING THE SYMBOLS OF THINGS INSTEAD OF THE THINGS THEMSELVES
4260-176854-0021 OF TERMS EITHER INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY ALTERED FROM THEIR TRUE MEANING AND OF WORDS WHICH RESEMBLED OTHER WORDS IN SOUND BUT WHICH HAD NOT THE SAME SIGNIFICATION
4260-176854-0022 FROM PAIN BREAD WHICH THEY PUT INTO IT THE ARMS WERE LYANS BINDERS
4260-176854-0023 HORNED A PURSE A FOUILLE OR FOUILLOUSE A COCK
4260-176854-0024 NINE PINS A SOU A ROND OR ROUND THING THE EYES
4260-176854-0025 WHICH TESTIFIES TO THE PART WHICH THESE VAGABONDS PLAYED IN THE FORMATION OF THE ARGOTIC COMMUNITY FOR EXAMPLE
4260-176854-0026 WORDS ALL DERIVED FROM THE GIPSY WORD LIMA A SHIRT
4260-176854-0027 WHICH IN THE GIPSY TONGUE MEAN RESPECTIVELY SILVER CASTLE AND KNIFE
4260-176854-0028 ONE MIGHT PERHAPS BE TEMPTED TO SUPPOSE THAT FRANCE WAS SPECIALLY PRIVILEGED BUT IT WAS NOT SO FOR ITALY WAS FAR WORSE IN THIS RESPECT THE ROGUES WERE CALLED BY THE ITALIANS BIANTI OR CERETANI
4260-176854-0029 AND WERE SUBDIVIDED INTO MORE THAN FORTY CLASSES
4260-176854-0030 IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO STATE THAT THE ANALOGUE OF MORE THAN ONE OF THESE CLASSES IS TO BE FOUND IN THE SHORT DESCRIPTION WE HAVE GIVEN OF THE ARGOTIC KINGDOM IN FRANCE WE WILL THEREFORE ONLY MENTION THOSE WHICH WERE MORE ESPECIALLY ITALIAN
4260-176854-0031 IT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT IN THE SOUTHERN COUNTRIES WHERE RELIGIONS SUPERSTITION WAS MORE MARKED THAN ELSEWHERE THE NUMEROUS FAMILY OF ROGUES HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN PRACTISING EVERY DESCRIPTION OF IMPOSTURE
4260-176854-0032 INASMUCH AS THEY TRUSTED TO THE VARIOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF RELIGIONS FEELING TO EFFECT THEIR PURPOSES
4260-176854-0033 THUS THE AFFRATI IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MORE ALMS AND OFFERINGS WENT ABOUT IN THE GARB OF MONKS AND PRIESTS EVEN SAYING MASS AND PRETENDING THAT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THEY HAD EXERCISED THEIR SACRED OFFICE
4260-176854-0034 WITH THEIR STRING OF BEADS IN THEIR HANDS AND ASKING HOW THEY WERE TO PAY FOR THE BELL
4260-176854-0035 THE FELSI PRETENDED THAT THEY WERE DIVINELY INSPIRED AND ENDOWED WITH THE GIFT OF SECOND SIGHT AND ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WERE HIDDEN TREASURES IN CERTAIN HOUSES UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF EVIL SPIRITS THEY ASSERTED THAT THESE TREASURES COULD NOT BE DISCOVERED WITHOUT DANGER
4260-176854-0036 EXCEPT BY MEANS OF FASTINGS AND OFFERINGS WHICH THEY AND THEIR BRETHREN COULD ALONE MAKE IN CONSIDERATION OF WHICH THEY ENTERED INTO A BARGAIN AND RECEIVED A CERTAIN SUM OF MONEY FROM THE OWNERS
4260-176854-0037 THE ACCATOSI DESERVE MENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE CLEVERNESS WITH WHICH THEY CONTRIVED TO ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF CAPTIVES RECENTLY ESCAPED FROM SLAVERY SHAKING THE CHAINS WITH WHICH THEY SAID THEY HAD BEEN BOUND
4260-176854-0038 JABBERING UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS TELLING HEART RENDING TALES OF THEIR SUFFERINGS AND PRIVATIONS
4260-176854-0039 THEY WENT ON THEIR KNEES BEGGING FOR MONEY THAT THEY MIGHT BUY OFF THEIR BRETHREN OR THEIR FRIENDS
4260-176854-0040 IT IS PROBABLE MOREOVER THAT ROBBERS DID NOT ALWAYS COMMIT THEIR DEPREDATIONS SINGLY AND THAT THEY EARLY UNDERSTOOD THE ADVANTAGES OF ASSOCIATING TOGETHER THE TAFURS OR HALEGRINS
4260-176854-0041 AT THE TIME OF THE CRUSADES TOWARDS THE END OF THE ELEVENTH CENTURY WERE TERRIBLY BAD CHARACTERS AND ARE ACTUALLY ACCUSED BY CONTEMPORARY WRITERS OF VIOLATING TOMBS AND OF LIVING ON HUMAN FLESH
4260-176854-0042 ON THIS ACCOUNT THEY WERE LOOKED UPON WITH THE UTMOST HORROR BY THE INFIDELS WHO DREADED MORE THEIR SAVAGE FEROCITY THAN THE VALOUR OF THE CRUSADERS THE LATTER EVEN
4260-176854-0043 UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE CROSS THESE MISCREANTS COMMITTED DEPREDATIONS
4260-176854-0044 FROM THE KING OF THAT COUNTRY AN ANCIENT POET HAS HANDED DOWN TO US A STORY IN VERSE SETTING FORTH THE EXPLOITS OF EUSTACE THE MONK WHO AFTER HAVING THROWN ASIDE HIS FROCK
4260-176854-0045 EMBRACED THE LIFE OF A ROBBER AND ONLY ABANDONED IT TO BECOME ADMIRAL OF FRANCE UNDER PHILIP AUGUSTUS HE WAS KILLED BEFORE SANDWICH IN TWELVE SEVENTEEN WE HAVE SATISFACTORY PROOF THAT AS EARLY AS THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY
4260-176854-0046 SHARPERS WERE VERY EXPERT MASTERS OF THEIR TRADE FOR THE INGENIOUS AND AMUSING TRICKS OF WHICH THEY WERE GUILTY ARE QUITE EQUAL TO THE MOST SKILLED OF THOSE NOW RECORDED IN OUR POLICE REPORTS
4260-176854-0047 IN THE TWO FOLLOWING CENTURIES THE SCIENCE OF THE PINCE AND OF THE CROC PINCERS AND HOOK AS IT WAS THEN CALLED ALONE MADE PROGRESS AND PATHELIN
4260-176854-0048 A CHARACTER IN COMEDY AND AN INCOMPARABLE TYPE OF CRAFT AND DISHONESTY NEVER LACKED DISCIPLES ANY MORE THAN VILLON DID IMITATORS WE KNOW THAT THIS CHARMING POET WHO WAS AT THE SAME TIME A MOST EXPERT THIEF
4260-176854-0049 AND WHO BIDS FAREWELL TO THE INNKEEPER BY WIPING HIS NOSE ON THE TABLECLOTH
4260-176854-0050 WE OUGHT TO CITE ONE OF A LATER PERIOD
4260-176854-0051 WHO EXCELLED IN ALL KINDS OF RASCALITY
4260-176854-0052 THE CHARACTER OF PANURGE
4260-176854-0053 WE MUST ALSO MENTION ONE OF THE PAMPHLETS OF GUILLAUME BOUCHET WRITTEN TOWARDS THE END OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY WHICH GIVES A VERY AMUSING ACCOUNT OF THIEVES OF EVERY DESCRIPTION
4260-176854-0054 IT MUST NOT BE SUPPOSED THAT IN THOSE DAYS THE LIFE OF A ROBBER WHO PURSUED HIS OCCUPATION WITH ANY DEGREE OF INDUSTRY AND SKILL WAS UNATTENDED WITH DANGER FOR THE MOST HARMLESS CUT PURSES WERE HUNG WITHOUT MERCY WHENEVER THEY WERE CAUGHT
4260-176854-0055 TO INTRODUCE TO HIM ON THE OCCASION OF A BANQUET AND A BALL THE CLEVEREST CUT PURSES GIVING THEM FULL LIBERTY TO EXHIBIT THEIR SKILL
4260-176854-0056 WHOM HE PRESENTED TO THE KING CHARLES AFTER THE DINNER AND THE BALL HAD TAKEN PLACE
4260-176854-0057 EITHER IN MONEY FROM PURSES OR IN PRECIOUS STONES PEARLS OR OTHER JEWELS SOME OF THE GUESTS EVEN LOST THEIR CLOAKS AT WHICH THE KING THOUGHT HE SHOULD DIE OF LAUGHTER THE KING ALLOWED THEM TO KEEP WHAT THEY HAD THUS EARNED
4260-176854-0058 AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS GUESTS BUT HE FORBAD THEM TO CONTINUE THIS SORT OF LIFE UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HUNG AND HE HAD THEM ENROLLED IN THE ARMY IN ORDER TO RECOMPENSE THEM FOR THEIR CLEVER FEATS
