4174-69293-0002 WHO WERE ABOUT TO ENTER A SILVER MOUNTED CARRIAGE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PREOCCUPATION PADRE DAMASO STROKED THE MAIDEN'S CHEEK LIGHTLY TO THE CONVENT TO GET MY THINGS
4174-69293-0003 AHAA AHA
4174-69293-0004 WE'LL SEE MUTTERED THE FRIAR ABSTRACTEDLY AS WITH BOWED HEAD AND SLOW STEP HE TURNED TO THE STAIRWAY LEAVING THE TWO WOMEN NOT A LITTLE AMAZED HE MUST HAVE A SERMON TO PREACH AND IS MEMORIZING IT COMMENTED AUNT ISABEL
4174-69293-0005 GET IN MARIA OR WE'LL BE LATE WHETHER OR NOT PADRE DAMASO WAS PREPARING A SERMON WE CANNOT SAY BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT SOME GRAVE MATTER FILLED HIS MIND FOR HE DID NOT EXTEND HIS HAND TO CAPITAN TIAGO
4174-69293-0006 WHO HAD ALMOST TO GET DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO KISS IT SANTIAGO SAID THE FRIAR AT ONCE I HAVE AN IMPORTANT MATTER TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT LET'S GO INTO YOUR OFFICE
4174-69293-0007 THE ASTUTE DOMINICAN IS NOT AT THE RECTORY FOR VERY SOON AFTER CELEBRATING MASS HE HAD GONE TO THE CONVENT OF HIS ORDER
4174-69293-0008 HE ENTERED PASSED ALONG SEVERAL CORRIDORS AND KNOCKED AT A DOOR COME IN SIGHED A WEAK VOICE MAY GOD RESTORE HEALTH TO YOUR REVERENCE
4174-69293-0009 WAS THE YOUNG DOMINICAN'S GREETING AS HE ENTERED SEATED IN A LARGE ARMCHAIR WAS AN AGED PRIEST WASTED AND RATHER SALLOW LIKE THE SAINTS THAT RIVERA PAINTED
4174-69293-0010 HIS EYES WERE SUNKEN IN THEIR HOLLOW SOCKETS OVER WHICH HIS HEAVY EYEBROWS WERE ALMOST ALWAYS CONTRACTED THUS ACCENTUATING THEIR BRILLIANT GLEAM
4174-69293-0011 GAZED AT HIM FEELINGLY THEN BOWED HIS HEAD AND WAITED IN SILENCE AH SIGHED THE OLD MAN THEY ADVISE AN OPERATION
4174-69293-0012 I AM SUFFERING TOO MUCH BUT I HAVE MADE MANY SUFFER I AM PAYING MY DEBT AND HOW ARE YOU WHAT HAS BROUGHT YOU HERE I'VE COME TO TALK ABOUT THE BUSINESS WHICH YOU COMMITTED TO MY CARE
4174-69293-0013 AH WHAT ABOUT IT PISH ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN DISGUSTEDLY AS HE SEATED HIMSELF AND TURNED AWAY HIS FACE WITH A CONTEMPTUOUS EXPRESSION THEY'VE BEEN TELLING US FAIRY TALES
4174-69293-0014 HE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A FOOL BUT I BELIEVE THAT HE IS A GOOD LAD YOU BELIEVE SO HOSTILITIES BEGAN LAST NIGHT ALREADY
4174-69293-0015 FRAY SIBYLA THEN RECOUNTED BRIEFLY WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN PADRE DAMASO AND IBARRA BESIDES HE SAID IN CONCLUSION THE YOUNG MAN IS GOING TO MARRY CAPITAN TIAGO'S DAUGHTER
4174-69293-0016 WHO WAS EDUCATED IN THE COLLEGE OF OUR SISTERHOOD HE'S RICH AND WON'T CARE TO MAKE ENEMIES AND TO RUN THE RISK OF RUINING HIS FORTUNE AND HIS HAPPINESS THE SICK MAN NODDED IN AGREEMENT YES I THINK AS YOU DO
4174-69293-0017 IF NOT SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR HIM TO DECLARE HIMSELF AN ENEMY OF OURS
4174-69293-0018 FOR THE GOOD OF OUR HOLY ORDER I MEAN OF COURSE HE ADDED BREATHING HEAVILY I PREFER OPEN ATTACKS TO THE SILLY PRAISES AND FLATTERIES OF FRIENDS WHICH ARE REALLY PAID FOR
4174-69293-0019 OUR POWER WILL LAST AS LONG AS IT IS BELIEVED IN IF THEY ATTACK US THE GOVERNMENT WILL SAY THEY ATTACK THEM BECAUSE THEY SEE IN THEM AN OBSTACLE TO THEIR LIBERTY SO THEN LET US PRESERVE THEM
4174-69293-0020 BUT IF IT SHOULD LISTEN TO THEM SOMETIMES THE GOVERNMENT IT WILL NOT LISTEN
4174-69293-0021 IF THERE SHOULD BE SOME BOLD AND DARING ONE
4174-69293-0022 BESIDES WE NEED THEIR ATTACKS TO KEEP US AWAKE THAT MAKES US SEE OUR WEAKNESSES SO THAT WE MAY REMEDY THEM EXAGGERATED FLATTERY WILL DECEIVE US AND PUT US TO SLEEP
4174-69293-0023 WHILE OUTSIDE OUR WALLS WE SHALL BE LAUGHED AT AND THE DAY IN WHICH WE BECOME AN OBJECT OF RIDICULE WE SHALL FALL AS WE FELL IN EUROPE MONEY WILL NOT FLOW INTO OUR CHURCHES
4174-69293-0024 NO ONE WILL BUY OUR SCAPULARIES OR GIRDLES OR ANYTHING ELSE AND WHEN WE CEASE TO BE RICH WE SHALL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO CONTROL CONSCIENCES
4174-69293-0025 BUT WE SHALL ALWAYS HAVE OUR ESTATES OUR PROPERTY ALL WILL BE LOST AS WE LOST THEM IN EUROPE AND THE WORST OF IT IS THAT WE ARE WORKING TOWARD OUR OWN RUIN
4174-69293-0026 FOR EXAMPLE THIS UNRESTRAINED EAGERNESS TO RAISE ARBITRARILY THE RENTS ON OUR LANDS EACH YEAR
4174-69293-0027 THE NATIVE SEES HIMSELF OBLIGED TO PURCHASE FARMS IN OTHER PLACES WHICH BRING HIM AS GOOD RETURNS AS OURS OR BETTER I FEAR THAT WE ARE ALREADY ON THE DECLINE
4174-69293-0028 THE PEOPLE ARE ALREADY MURMURING YOU HAVE DECIDED WELL LET US LEAVE THE OTHERS TO SETTLE THEIR ACCOUNTS IN THAT QUARTER LET US PRESERVE THE PRESTIGE THAT REMAINS TO US
4174-69293-0029 AND AS WE SHALL SOON APPEAR BEFORE GOD LET US WASH OUR HANDS OF IT AND MAY THE GOD OF MERCY HAVE PITY ON OUR WEAKNESS SO YOUR REVERENCE THINKS THAT THE RENT OR TAX
4174-69293-0030 BROKE IN FRAY SIBYLA WITH A FAINT SMILE BUT THIS MORNING I SAW HIM AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR WHAT OCCURRED LAST NIGHT THAT THE SHERRY HAD GONE TO HIS HEAD AND THAT HE BELIEVED THAT PADRE DAMASO WAS IN THE SAME CONDITION AND YOUR THREAT
4174-69293-0031 I ASKED HIM JOKINGLY PADRE HE ANSWERED ME I KNOW HOW TO KEEP MY WORD WHEN MY HONOR IS AFFECTED BUT I AM NOT NOR HAVE EVER BEEN AN INFORMER FOR THAT REASON I WEAR ONLY TWO STARS
4174-69293-0032 IT WAS TRUE THAT THE LIEUTENANT HAD NOT GONE TO THE PALACE BUT THE CAPTAIN GENERAL HEARD WHAT HAD OCCURRED WHILE TALKING WITH SOME OF HIS AIDES ABOUT THE ALLUSIONS THAT THE MANILA NEWSPAPERS WERE MAKING TO HIM UNDER THE NAMES OF COMETS AND CELESTIAL APPARITIONS
4174-69293-0033 ONE OF THEM TOLD HIM ABOUT THE AFFAIR OF PADRE DAMASO WITH A SOMEWHAT HEIGHTENED COLORING ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIALLY CORRECT AS TO MATTER FROM WHOM DID YOU LEARN THIS ASKED HIS EXCELLENCY SMILING
4174-69293-0034 THE CAPTAIN GENERAL AGAIN SMILED AND SAID A WOMAN OR A FRIAR CAN'T INSULT ONE I CONTEMPLATE LIVING IN PEACE FOR THE TIME THAT I SHALL REMAIN IN THIS COUNTRY AND I DON'T WANT ANY MORE QUARRELS WITH MEN WHO WEAR SKIRTS
4174-69293-0035 BESIDES I'VE LEARNED THAT THE PROVINCIAL HAS SCOFFED AT MY ORDERS I ASKED FOR THE REMOVAL OF THIS FRIAR AS A PUNISHMENT AND THEY TRANSFERRED HIM TO A BETTER TOWN MONKISH TRICKS AS WE SAY IN SPAIN
4174-69293-0036 BUT WHEN HIS EXCELLENCY FOUND HIMSELF ALONE HE STOPPED SMILING
4174-69293-0037 HE SIGHED TO HIMSELF BUT EVERY PEOPLE DESERVES ITS FATE SO LET'S DO AS EVERYBODY ELSE DOES CAPITAN TIAGO MEANWHILE HAD CONCLUDED HIS INTERVIEW WITH PADRE DAMASO OR RATHER TO SPEAK MORE EXACTLY
4174-69293-0038 PADRE DAMASO HAD CONCLUDED WITH HIM SO NOW YOU ARE WARNED SAID THE FRANCISCAN ON LEAVING ALL THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF YOU HAD CONSULTED ME BEFOREHAND IF YOU HAD NOT LIED WHEN I ASKED YOU
4174-69293-0039 TRY NOT TO PLAY ANY MORE FOOLISH TRICKS AND TRUST YOUR PROTECTOR
