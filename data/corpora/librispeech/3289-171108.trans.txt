3289-171108-0000 AND AFTER HE HAD PUT HIS MOTHER AND BROTHER TO DEATH DIED HIMSELF
3289-171108-0001 ONE FOR AFTER THE DEATH OF THEIR FATHER THE ELDER OF THEM ARISTOBULUS CHANGED THE GOVERNMENT INTO A KINGDOM AND WAS THE FIRST THAT PUT A DIADEM UPON HIS HEAD FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY AND ONE YEARS AND THREE MONTHS
3289-171108-0002 AFTER OUR PEOPLE CAME DOWN INTO THIS COUNTRY WHEN THEY WERE SET FREE FROM THE BABYLONIAN SLAVERY NOW OF HIS BRETHREN HE APPEARED TO HAVE AN AFFECTION FOR ANTIGONUS WHO WAS NEXT TO HIM AND MADE HIM HIS EQUAL BUT FOR THE REST HE BOUND THEM AND PUT THEM IN PRISON
3289-171108-0003 HE ALSO PUT HIS MOTHER IN BONDS FOR HER CONTESTING THE GOVERNMENT WITH HIM FOR JOHN HAD LEFT HER TO BE THE GOVERNESS OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS HE ALSO PROCEEDED TO THAT DEGREE OF BARBARITY AS TO CAUSE HER TO BE PINED TO DEATH IN PRISON TWO
3289-171108-0004 BUT VENGEANCE CIRCUMVENTED HIM IN THE AFFAIR OF HIS BROTHER ANTIGONUS WHOM HE LOVED AND WHOM HE MADE HIS PARTNER IN THE KINGDOM FOR HE SLEW HIM BY THE MEANS OF THE CALUMNIES WHICH ILL MEN ABOUT THE PALACE CONTRIVED AGAINST HIM
3289-171108-0005 HOWEVER AS ANTIGONUS CAME ONCE IN A SPLENDID MANNER FROM THE ARMY TO THAT FESTIVAL WHEREIN OUR ANCIENT CUSTOM IS TO MAKE TABERNACLES FOR GOD IT HAPPENED IN THOSE DAYS THAT ARISTOBULUS WAS SICK AND THAT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE FEAST
3289-171108-0006 AND TOLD HIM IN WHAT A POMPOUS MANNER THE ARMED MEN CAME AND WITH WHAT INSOLENCE ANTIGONUS MARCHED AND THAT SUCH HIS INSOLENCE WAS TOO GREAT FOR A PRIVATE PERSON AND THAT ACCORDINGLY HE WAS COME WITH A GREAT BAND OF MEN TO KILL HIM
3289-171108-0007 WHEN IT WAS IN HIS POWER TO TAKE THE KINGDOM HIMSELF THREE NOW ARISTOBULUS BY DEGREES AND UNWILLINGLY GAVE CREDIT TO THESE ACCUSATIONS AND ACCORDINGLY HE TOOK CARE NOT TO DISCOVER HIS SUSPICION OPENLY
3289-171108-0008 THOUGH HE PROVIDED TO BE SECURE AGAINST ANY ACCIDENTS SO HE PLACED THE GUARDS OF HIS BODY IN A CERTAIN DARK SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE FOR HE LAY SICK IN A PLACE CALLED FORMERLY THE CITADEL THOUGH AFTERWARDS ITS NAME WAS CHANGED TO ANTONIA
3289-171108-0009 AND HE GAVE ORDERS THAT IF ANTIGONUS CAME UNARMED THEY SHOULD LET HIM ALONE BUT IF HE CAME TO HIM IN HIS ARMOR THEY SHOULD KILL HIM
3289-171108-0010 BUT UPON THIS OCCASION THE QUEEN VERY CUNNINGLY CONTRIVED THE MATTER WITH THOSE THAT PLOTTED HIS RUIN FOR SHE PERSUADED THOSE THAT WERE SENT TO CONCEAL THE KING'S MESSAGE BUT TO TELL ANTIGONUS HOW HIS BROTHER HAD HEARD
3289-171108-0011 HE HAD GOT A VERY THE SUIT OF ARMOR MADE WITH FINE MARTIAL ORNAMENTS IN GALILEE AND BECAUSE HIS PRESENT SICKNESS HINDERED HIM FROM COMING AND SEEING ALL THAT FINERY HE VERY MUCH DESIRED TO SEE HIM NOW IN HIS ARMOR BECAUSE SAID HE
3289-171108-0012 IN A LITTLE TIME THOU ART GOING AWAY FROM ME FOUR AS SOON AS ANTIGONUS HEARD THIS THE GOOD TEMPER OF HIS BROTHER NOT ALLOWING HIM TO SUSPECT ANY HARM FROM HIM HE CAME ALONG WITH HIS ARMOR ON TO SHOW IT TO HIS BROTHER
3289-171108-0013 BUT WHEN HE WAS GOING ALONG THAT DARK PASSAGE WHICH WAS CALLED STRATO'S TOWER HE WAS SLAIN BY THE BODY GUARDS AND BECAME AN EMINENT INSTANCE HOW CALUMNY DESTROYS ALL GOOD WILL AND NATURAL AFFECTION AND HOW NONE OF OUR GOOD AFFECTIONS ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO RESIST ENVY PERPETUALLY
3289-171108-0014 FIVE AND TRULY ANY ONE WOULD BE SURPRISED AT JUDAS UPON THIS OCCASION HE WAS OF THE SECT OF THE ESSENS AND HAD NEVER FAILED OR DECEIVED MEN IN HIS PREDICTIONS BEFORE NOW THIS MAN SAW ANTIGONUS AS HE WAS PASSING ALONG BY THE TEMPLE
3289-171108-0015 AND THE PLACE WHERE HE OUGHT TO BE SLAIN ACCORDING TO THAT FATAL DECREE WAS STRATO'S TOWER WHICH IS AT THE DISTANCE OF SIX HUNDRED FURLONGS FROM THIS PLACE AND YET FOUR HOURS OF THIS DAY ARE OVER ALREADY
3289-171108-0016 WHICH STILL APPEARED HEREUPON A LAMENTABLE CRY AROSE AMONG THE SPECTATORS AS IF THE SERVANT HAD SPILLED THE BLOOD ON PURPOSE IN THAT PLACE AND AS THE KING HEARD THAT CRY HE INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF IT AND WHILE NOBODY DURST TELL HIM
3289-171108-0017 SO I PERCEIVE I AM NOT LIKE TO ESCAPE THE ALL SEEING EYE OF GOD AS TO THE GREAT CRIMES I HAVE COMMITTED BUT THE VENGEANCE OF THE BLOOD OF MY KINSMAN PURSUES ME HASTILY O THOU MOST IMPUDENT BODY
3289-171108-0018 WHAT ACTIONS WERE DONE BY ALEXANDER JANNEUS WHO REIGNED TWENTY SEVEN YEARS ONE AND NOW THE KING'S WIFE LOOSED THE KING'S BRETHREN AND MADE ALEXANDER KING WHO APPEARED BOTH ELDER IN AGE AND MORE MODERATE IN HIS TEMPER THAN THE REST
3289-171108-0019 NOW IT HAPPENED THAT THERE WAS A BATTLE BETWEEN HIM AND PTOLEMY WHO WAS CALLED LATHYRUS WHO HAD TAKEN THE CITY ASOCHIS HE INDEED SLEW A GREAT MANY OF HIS ENEMIES BUT THE VICTORY RATHER INCLINED TO PTOLEMY BUT WHEN THIS PTOLEMY WAS PURSUED BY HIS MOTHER CLEOPATRA
3289-171108-0020 AND RETIRED INTO EGYPT ALEXANDER BESIEGED GADARA AND TOOK IT
3289-171108-0021 ALEXANDER RECOVERED THIS BLOW AND TURNED HIS FORCE TOWARDS THE MARITIME PARTS AND TOOK RAPHIA AND GAZA WITH ANTHEDON ALSO WHICH WAS AFTERWARDS CALLED AGRIPPIAS BY KING HEROD THREE
3289-171108-0022 BUT WHEN HE HAD MADE SLAVES OF THE CITIZENS OF ALL THESE CITIES THE NATION OF THE JEWS MADE AN INSURRECTION AGAINST HIM AT A FESTIVAL FOR AT THOSE FEASTS SEDITIONS ARE GENERALLY BEGUN AND IT LOOKED AS IF HE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ESCAPE THE PLOT THEY HAD LAID FOR HIM
3289-171108-0023 HAD NOT HIS FOREIGN AUXILIARIES THE PISIDIANS AND CILICIANS ASSISTED HIM FOR AS TO THE SYRIANS HE NEVER ADMITTED THEM AMONG HIS MERCENARY TROOPS ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR INNATE ENMITY AGAINST THE JEWISH NATION
3289-171108-0024 AND WHEN HE HAD SLAIN MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND OF THE REBELS HE MADE AN INCURSION INTO ARABIA AND WHEN HE HAD TAKEN THAT COUNTRY TOGETHER WITH THE GILEADIRES AND MOABITES HE ENJOINED THEM TO PAY HIM TRIBUTE
3289-171108-0025 AND WHEN HE HAD MADE HIS ESCAPE TO JERUSALEM HE PROVOKED THE MULTITUDE WHICH HATED HIM BEFORE TO MAKE AN INSURRECTION AGAINST HIM AND THIS ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREATNESS OF THE CALAMITY THAT HE WAS UNDER HOWEVER HE WAS THEN TOO HARD FOR THEM
3289-171108-0026 AND IN THE SEVERAL BATTLES THAT WERE FOUGHT ON BOTH SIDES HE SLEW NOT FEWER THAN FIFTY THOUSAND OF THE JEWS IN THE INTERVAL OF SIX YEARS
3289-171108-0027 SINCE HE DID BUT CONSUME HIS OWN KINGDOM TILL AT LENGTH HE LEFT OFF FIGHTING AND ENDEAVORED TO COME TO A COMPOSITION WITH THEM BY TALKING WITH HIS SUBJECTS BUT THIS MUTABILITY AND IRREGULARITY OF HIS CONDUCT MADE THEM HATE HIM STILL MORE
3289-171108-0028 AT THE SAME TIME THEY INVITED DEMETRIUS
3289-171108-0029 AND AS HE READILY COMPLIED WITH THEIR REQUESTS IN HOPES OF GREAT ADVANTAGES
3289-171108-0030 WHILE THE ADVERSE PARTY HAD THREE THOUSAND HORSEMEN AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND FOOTMEN NOW BEFORE THEY JOINED BATTLE THE KINGS MADE PROCLAMATION AND ENDEAVORED TO DRAW OFF EACH OTHER'S SOLDIERS AND MAKE THEM REVOLT
3289-171108-0031 WHILE DEMETRIUS HOPED TO INDUCE ALEXANDER'S MERCENARIES TO LEAVE HIM AND ALEXANDER HOPED TO INDUCE THE JEWS THAT WERE WITH DEMETRIUS TO LEAVE HIM BUT SINCE NEITHER THE JEWS WOULD LEAVE OFF THEIR RAGE NOR THE GREEKS PROVE UNFAITHFUL THEY CAME TO AN ENGAGEMENT
3289-171108-0032 AND TO A CLOSE FIGHT WITH THEIR WEAPONS IN WHICH BATTLE DEMETRIUS WAS THE CONQUEROR ALTHOUGH ALEXANDER'S MERCENARIES SHOWED THE GREATEST EXPLOITS BOTH IN SOUL AND BODY YET DID THE UPSHOT OF THIS BATTLE PROVE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WAS EXPECTED AS TO BOTH OF THEM
3289-171108-0033 FOR NEITHER DID THOSE THAT INVITED DEMETRIUS TO COME TO THEM CONTINUE FIRM TO HIM THOUGH HE WAS CONQUEROR AND SIX THOUSAND JEWS OUT OF PITY TO THE CHANGE OF ALEXANDER'S CONDITION WHEN HE WAS FLED TO THE MOUNTAINS CAME OVER TO HIM
3289-171108-0034 YET COULD NOT DEMETRIUS BEAR THIS TURN OF AFFAIRS BUT SUPPOSING THAT ALEXANDER WAS ALREADY BECOME A MATCH FOR HIM AGAIN AND THAT ALL THE NATION WOULD AT LENGTH RUN TO HIM
3289-171108-0035 THE REST OF THE JEWISH MULTITUDE DID NOT LAY ASIDE THEIR QUARRELS WITH HIM WHEN THE FOREIGN AUXILIARIES WERE GONE BUT THEY HAD A PERPETUAL WAR WITH ALEXANDER UNTIL HE HAD SLAIN THE GREATEST PART OF THEM AND DRIVEN THE REST INTO THE CITY BERNESELIS AND WHEN HE HAD DEMOLISHED THAT CITY
3289-171108-0036 HE CARRIED THE CAPTIVES TO JERUSALEM NAY HIS RAGE WAS GROWN SO EXTRAVAGANT THAT HIS BARBARITY PROCEEDED TO THE DEGREE OF IMPIETY FOR WHEN HE HAD ORDERED EIGHT HUNDRED TO BE HUNG UPON CROSSES IN THE MIDST OF THE CITY HE HAD THE THROATS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN CUT BEFORE THEIR EYES
3289-171108-0037 THIS MAN WAS THE BROTHER OF DEMETRIUS AND THE LAST OF THE RACE OF THE SELEUCIDAE
3289-171108-0038 ALEXANDER WAS AFRAID OF HIM WHEN HE WAS MARCHING AGAINST THE ARABIANS SO HE CUT A DEEP TRENCH BETWEEN ANTIPATRIS WHICH WAS NEAR THE MOUNTAINS AND THE SHORES OF JOPPA HE ALSO ERECTED A HIGH WALL BEFORE THE TRENCH
3289-171108-0039 AND BUILT WOODEN TOWERS IN ORDER TO HINDER ANY SUDDEN APPROACHES BUT STILL HE WAS NOT ABLE TO EXCLUDE ANTIOCHUS FOR HE BURNT THE TOWERS AND FILLED UP THE TRENCHES AND MARCHED ON WITH HIS ARMY AND AS HE LOOKED UPON TAKING HIS REVENGE ON ALEXANDER
3289-171108-0040 EIGHT ABOUT THIS TIME IT WAS THAT THE PEOPLE OF DAMASCUS OUT OF THEIR HATRED TO PTOLEMY THE SON OF MENHENS INVITED ARETAS TO TAKE THE GOVERNMENT AND MADE HIM KING OF CELESYRIA THIS MAN ALSO MADE AN EXPEDITION AGAINST JUDEA
3289-171108-0041 AND BEAT ALEXANDER IN BATTLE BUT AFTERWARDS RETIRED BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT BUT ALEXANDER WHEN HE HAD TAKEN PELLA MARCHED TO GERASA AGAIN
3289-171108-0042 AND WHEN HE HAD BUILT A TRIPLE WALL ABOUT THE GARRISON HE TOOK THE PLACE BY FORCE HE ALSO DEMOLISHED GOLAN AND SELEUCIA AND WHAT WAS CALLED THE VALLEY OF ANTIOCHUS BESIDES WHICH HE TOOK THE STRONG FORTRESS OF GAMALA
