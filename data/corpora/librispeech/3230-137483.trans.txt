3230-137483-0000 AT THE HOUSE OF MADAME AVOGADRO A WOMAN FULL OF WIT IN SPITE OF HER SIXTY YEARS
3230-137483-0001 OF A YOUNG POLISH NOBLEMAN CALLED ZAWOISKI HE WAS EXPECTING MONEY FROM POLAND BUT IN THE MEAN TIME THE VENETIAN LADIES DID NOT LET HIM WANT FOR ANY BEING ALL VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HIS HANDSOME FACE AND HIS POLISH MANNERS
3230-137483-0002 WE SOON BECAME GOOD FRIENDS MY PURSE WAS HIS BUT TWENTY YEARS LATER HE ASSISTED ME TO A FAR GREATER EXTENT IN MUNICH ZAWOISKI WAS HONEST HE HAD ONLY A SMALL DOSE OF INTELLIGENCE BUT IT WAS ENOUGH FOR HIS HAPPINESS
3230-137483-0003 I WILL SPEAK OF HIM IN ANOTHER PART OF THESE MEMOIRS THIS AMIABLE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS A FAVOURITE WITH EVERYBODY AND WAS THOUGHT A FREE THINKER BECAUSE HE FREQUENTED THE SOCIETY OF ANGELO QUERINI AND LUNARDO VENIER
3230-137483-0004 PRESENTED ME ONE DAY AS WE WERE OUT WALKING TO AN UNKNOWN COUNTESS WHO TOOK MY FANCY VERY STRONGLY WE CALLED ON HER IN THE EVENING AND AFTER INTRODUCING ME TO HER HUSBAND COUNT RINALDI SHE INVITED US TO REMAIN AND HAVE SUPPER
3230-137483-0005 THE COUNT MADE A FARO BANK IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING I PUNTED WITH HIS WIFE AS A PARTNER
3230-137483-0006 VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH MY NEW ACQUAINTANCE I CALLED ALONE ON THE COUNTESS THE NEXT MORNING THE COUNT APOLOGIZING FOR HIS WIFE WHO WAS NOT UP YET TOOK ME TO HER ROOM SHE RECEIVED ME WITH GRACEFUL EASE
3230-137483-0007 AND HER HUSBAND HAVING LEFT US ALONE SHE HAD THE ART TO LET ME HOPE FOR EVERY FAVOUR YET WITHOUT COMMITTING HERSELF WHEN I TOOK LEAVE OF HER SHE INVITED ME TO SUPPER FOR THE EVENING AFTER SUPPER I PLAYED
3230-137483-0008 STILL IN PARTNERSHIP WITH HER WON AGAIN AND WENT AWAY VERY MUCH IN LOVE I DID NOT FAIL TO PAY HER ANOTHER VISIT THE NEXT MORNING BUT WHEN I PRESENTED MYSELF AT THE HOUSE I WAS TOLD THAT SHE HAD GONE OUT
3230-137483-0009 AND AFTER SHE HAD EXCUSED HERSELF FOR NOT HAVING BEEN AT HOME IN THE MORNING THE FARO BANK BEGAN AND I LOST ALL MY MONEY STILL HAVING THE COUNTESS FOR MY PARTNER AFTER SUPPER AND WHEN THE OTHER GUESTS HAD RETIRED I REMAINED WITH ZAWOISKI
3230-137483-0010 COUNT RINALDI HAVING OFFERED TO GIVE US OUR REVENGE AS I HAD NO MORE MONEY I PLAYED UPON TRUST AND THE COUNT THREW DOWN THE CARDS AFTER I HAD LOST FIVE HUNDRED SEQUINS I WENT AWAY IN GREAT SORROW
3230-137483-0011 I WAS BOUND IN HONOUR TO PAY THE NEXT MORNING AND I DID NOT POSSESS A GROAT LOVE INCREASED MY DESPAIR FOR I SAW MYSELF ON THE POINT OF LOSING THE ESTEEM OF A WOMAN BY WHOM I WAS SMITTEN
3230-137483-0012 WHEN WE MET IN THE MORNING HE KINDLY ENCOURAGED ME TO CONFESS MY TROUBLES TO HIM I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS MY ONLY CHANCE AND CANDIDLY RELATED THE WHOLE AFFAIR AND I ENDED BY SAYING THAT I SHOULD NOT SURVIVE MY DISGRACE
3230-137483-0013 HE CONSOLED ME BY PROMISING THAT MY DEBT WOULD BE CANCELLED IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY IF I WOULD SWEAR NEVER TO PLAY AGAIN UPON TRUST I TOOK AN OATH TO THAT EFFECT AND KISSING HIS HAND I WENT OUT FOR A WALK RELIEVED FROM A GREAT LOAD
3230-137483-0014 I HAD NO DOUBT THAT MY EXCELLENT FATHER WOULD GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED SEQUINS DURING THE DAY AND I ENJOYED MY ANTICIPATION THE HONOUR I WOULD DERIVE IN THE OPINION OF THE LOVELY COUNTESS BY MY EXACTITUDE AND PROMPT DISCHARGE OF MY DEBT
3230-137483-0015 I FELT THAT IT GAVE NEW STRENGTH TO MY HOPES AND THAT FEELING PREVENTED ME FROM REGRETTING MY HEAVY LOSS BUT GRATEFUL FOR THE GREAT GENEROSITY OF MY BENEFACTOR I WAS FULLY DETERMINED ON KEEPING MY PROMISE
3230-137483-0016 I DINED WITH THE THREE FRIENDS AND THE MATTER WAS NOT EVEN ALLUDED TO BUT
3230-137483-0017 AND A PARCEL HE READ THE LETTER ASKED ME TO FOLLOW HIM INTO HIS STUDY AND THE MOMENT WE WERE ALONE HE SAID HERE IS A PARCEL FOR YOU I OPENED IT AND FOUND SOME FORTY SEQUINS SEEING MY SURPRISE
3230-137483-0018 THE CONTENTS OF WHICH RAN THUS
3230-137483-0019 MAY BE SURE THAT OUR PLAYING LAST NIGHT WAS ONLY A JOKE HE OWES ME NOTHING MY WIFE BEGS TO SEND HIM HALF OF THE GOLD WHICH HE HAS LOST IN CASH COUNT RINALDI
3230-137483-0020 PERFECTLY AMAZED AND HE BURST OUT LAUGHING I GUESSED THE TRUTH THANKED HIM AND EMBRACING HIM TENDERLY I PROMISED TO BE WISER FOR THE FUTURE THE MIST I HAD BEFORE MY EYES WAS DISPELLED I FELT THAT MY LOVE WAS DEFUNCT
3230-137483-0021 AND I REMAINED RATHER ASHAMED WHEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD BEEN THE DUPE OF THE WIFE AS WELL AS OF THE HUSBAND THIS EVENING SAID MY CLEVER PHYSICIAN YOU CAN HAVE A GAY SUPPER WITH THE CHARMING COUNTESS THIS EVENING MY DEAR RESPECTED BENEFACTOR
3230-137483-0022 I WILL HAVE SUPPER WITH YOU YOU HAVE GIVEN ME A MASTERLY LESSON THE NEXT TIME YOU LOSE MONEY UPON TRUST YOU HAD BETTER NOT PAY IT BUT I SHOULD BE DISHONOURED NEVER MIND THE SOONER YOU DISHONOUR YOURSELF
3230-137483-0023 THE MORE YOU WILL SAVE FOR YOU WILL ALWAYS BE COMPELLED TO ACCEPT YOUR DISHONOUR WHENEVER YOU FIND YOURSELF UTTERLY UNABLE TO PAY YOUR LOSSES IT IS THEREFORE MORE PRUDENT NOT TO WAIT UNTIL THEN
3230-137483-0024 IT IS MUCH BETTER STILL TO AVOID THAT FATAL IMPOSSIBILITY BY NEVER PLAYING OTHERWISE THAN WITH MONEY IN HAND NO DOUBT OF IT FOR THEN YOU WILL SAVE BOTH YOUR HONOUR AND YOUR PURSE BUT AS YOU ARE FOND OF GAMES OF CHANCE I ADVISE YOU NEVER TO PUNT
3230-137483-0025 MAKE THE BANK AND THE ADVANTAGE MUST BE ON YOUR SIDE YES BUT ONLY A SLIGHT ADVANTAGE AS SLIGHT AS YOU PLEASE BUT IT WILL BE ON YOUR SIDE AND WHEN THE GAME IS OVER YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF A WINNER AND NOT A LOSER THE PUNTER IS EXCITED
3230-137483-0026 THE BANKER IS CALM THE LAST SAYS I BET YOU DO NOT GUESS WHILE THE FIRST SAYS I BET I CAN GUESS WHICH IS THE FOOL AND WHICH IS THE WISE MAN THE QUESTION IS EASILY ANSWERED
3230-137483-0027 IF AT THE END YOU LOSE WHY AN IDIOT FORTUNE IS VERY FICKLE
3230-137483-0028 IT IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE LEAVE OFF PLAYING BELIEVE ME THE VERY MOMENT YOU SEE LUCK TURNING EVEN IF YOU SHOULD AT THAT MOMENT WIN BUT ONE GROAT I HAD READ PLATO AND I WAS ASTONISHED AT FINDING A MAN WHO COULD REASON LIKE SOCRATES
3230-137483-0029 THE NEXT DAY ZAWOISKI CALLED ON ME VERY EARLY TO TELL ME THAT I HAD BEEN EXPECTED TO SUPPER AND THAT COUNT RINALDI HAD PRAISED MY PROMPTNESS IN PAYING MY DEBTS OF HONOUR I DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO UNDECEIVE HIM
3230-137483-0030 BUT I DID NOT GO AGAIN TO COUNT RINALDI'S WHOM I SAW SIXTEEN YEARS AFTERWARDS IN MILAN AS TO ZAWOISKI I DID NOT TELL HIM THE STORY TILL I MET HIM IN CARLSBAD OLD AND DEAF FORTY YEARS LATER THREE OR FOUR MONTHS LATER
3230-137483-0031 TAUGHT ME ANOTHER OF HIS MASTERLY LESSONS I HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED THROUGH ZAWOISKI WITH A FRENCHMAN CALLED L'ABBADIE WHO WAS THEN SOLICITING FROM THE VENETIAN GOVERNMENT THE APPOINTMENT OF INSPECTOR OF THE ARMIES OF THE REPUBLIC THE SENATE APPOINTED
3230-137483-0032 AND I PRESENTED HIM TO MY PROTECTOR WHO PROMISED HIM HIS VOTE BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCE I AM GOING TO RELATE PREVENTED HIM FROM FULFILLING HIS PROMISE
3230-137483-0033 TRY HIM I AM CERTAIN THAT HE WILL BE GLAD TO LEND YOU THAT SUM I DOUBT IT BUT I WILL TRY I CALLED UPON L'ABBADIE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AND AFTER A SHORT EXCHANGE OF COMPLIMENTS I TOLD HIM THE SERVICE I EXPECTED FROM HIS FRIENDSHIP
3230-137483-0034 HE EXCUSED HIMSELF IN A VERY POLITE MANNER DROWNING HIS REFUSAL IN THAT SEA OF COMMONPLACES WHICH PEOPLE ARE SURE TO REPEAT WHEN THEY CANNOT OR WILL NOT OBLIGE A FRIEND ZAWOISKI CAME IN AS HE WAS STILL APOLOGIZING AND I LEFT THEM TOGETHER
3230-137483-0035 HE MERELY REMARKED THAT THE FRENCHMAN WAS DEFICIENT IN INTELLIGENCE IT JUST HAPPENED THAT IT WAS THE VERY DAY ON WHICH THE APPOINTMENT OF THE INSPECTORSHIP WAS TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE SENATE I WENT OUT TO ATTEND TO MY BUSINESS I OUGHT TO SAY TO MY PLEASURE
3230-137483-0036 AND AS I DID NOT RETURN HOME TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT I WENT TO BED WITHOUT SEEING MY FATHER IN THE MORNING I SAID IN HIS PRESENCE THAT I INTENDED TO CALL UPON L'ABBADIE TO CONGRATULATE HIM UPON HIS APPOINTMENT YOU MAY SPARE YOURSELF THAT TROUBLE
3230-137483-0037 THE SENATE HAS REJECTED HIS NOMINATION HOW SO THREE DAYS AGO L'ABBADIE FELT SURE OF HIS SUCCESS HE WAS RIGHT THEN FOR HE WOULD HAVE BEEN APPOINTED IF I HAD NOT MADE UP MY MIND TO SPEAK AGAINST HIM
3230-137483-0038 I HAVE PROVED TO THE SENATE THAT A RIGHT POLICY FORBADE THE GOVERNMENT TO TRUST SUCH AN IMPORTANT POST TO A FOREIGNER I AM MUCH SURPRISED FOR YOUR EXCELLENCY WAS NOT OF THAT OPINION THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY VERY TRUE
3230-137483-0039 I FOUND OUT ONLY YESTERDAY THAT THE MAN WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY INTELLIGENT TO FILL THE POSITION HE WAS SOLICITING IS HE LIKELY TO POSSESS A SANE JUDGMENT WHEN HE REFUSES TO LEND YOU ONE HUNDRED SEQUINS
3230-137483-0040 THAT REFUSAL HAS COST HIM AN IMPORTANT APPOINTMENT AND AN INCOME OF THREE THOUSAND CROWNS WHICH WOULD NOW BE HIS WHEN I WAS TAKING MY WALK ON THE SAME DAY I MET ZAWOISKI WITH L'ABBADIE AND DID NOT TRY TO AVOID THEM
3230-137483-0041 L'ABBADIE WAS FURIOUS AND HE HAD SOME REASON TO BE SO
3230-137483-0042 GUARIENTI AND MY BROTHER LEFT VENICE FOR ROME WHERE JEAN REMAINED IN THE STUDIO OF THE CELEBRATED PAINTER RAPHAEL MENGS WHOM WE SHALL MEET AGAIN HEREAFTER
3230-137483-0043 IN THE EARLY PART OF OCTOBER SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX THE THEATRES BEING OPENED I WAS WALKING ABOUT WITH MY MASK ON WHEN I PERCEIVED A WOMAN WHOSE HEAD WAS WELL ENVELOPED IN THE HOOD OF HER MANTLE GETTING OUT OF THE FERRARA BARGE WHICH HAD JUST ARRIVED
3230-137483-0044 SEEING HER ALONE AND OBSERVING HER UNCERTAIN WALK I FELT MYSELF DRAWN TOWARDS HER AS IF AN UNSEEN HAND HAD GUIDED ME I COME UP TO HER AND OFFER MY SERVICES IF I CAN BE OF ANY USE TO HER
3230-137483-0045 BUT IF YOU WOULD BE KIND ENOUGH TO COME WITH ME TO A CAFE
3230-137483-0046 SHE HESITATES I INSIST AND SHE GIVES WAY THE TAVERN WAS CLOSE AT HAND
3230-137483-0047 I TAKE OFF MY MASK AND OUT OF POLITENESS SHE MUST PUT DOWN THE HOOD OF HER MANTLE A LARGE MUSLIN HEAD DRESS CONCEALS HALF OF HER FACE BUT HER EYES HER NOSE AND HER PRETTY MOUTH ARE ENOUGH TO LET ME SEE ON HER FEATURES BEAUTY
3230-137483-0048 NOBLENESS SORROW AND THAT CANDOUR WHICH GIVES YOUTH SUCH AN UNDEFINABLE CHARM I NEED NOT SAY THAT WITH SUCH A GOOD LETTER OF INTRODUCTION THE UNKNOWN AT ONCE CAPTIVATED MY WARMEST INTEREST
3230-137483-0049 AFTER WIPING AWAY A FEW TEARS WHICH ARE FLOWING IN SPITE OF ALL HER EFFORTS
3230-137483-0050 AND THEN DECEIVED HER THUS SEALING HER EVERLASTING MISERY YOU HAVE THEN SOME HOPE OF RECALLING HIM TO THE PATH OF DUTY I SUPPOSE HE HAS PROMISED YOU MARRIAGE HE HAS ENGAGED HIS FAITH TO ME IN WRITING THE ONLY FAVOUR I CLAIM FROM YOUR KINDNESS
3230-137483-0051 IS TO TAKE ME TO HIS HOUSE TO LEAVE ME THERE AND TO KEEP MY SECRET YOU MAY TRUST MADAM TO THE FEELINGS OF A MAN OF HONOUR I AM WORTHY OF YOUR TRUST HAVE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN ME FOR I ALREADY TAKE A DEEP INTEREST IN ALL YOUR CONCERNS
3230-137483-0052 TELL ME HIS NAME ALAS SIR I GIVE WAY TO FATE WITH THESE WORDS SHE TAKES OUT OF HER BOSOM A PAPER WHICH SHE GIVES ME I RECOGNIZE THE HANDWRITING OF ZANETTO STEFFANI
3230-137483-0053 IT WAS A PROMISE OF MARRIAGE BY WHICH HE ENGAGED HIS WORD OF HONOUR TO MARRY WITHIN A WEEK IN VENICE THE YOUNG COUNTESS A S WHEN I HAVE READ THE PAPER I RETURN IT TO HER SAYING THAT I KNEW THE WRITER QUITE WELL THAT HE WAS CONNECTED WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE KNOWN AS A GREAT LIBERTINE
3230-137483-0054 AND DEEPLY IN DEBT BUT THAT HE WOULD BE RICH AFTER HIS MOTHER'S DEATH FOR GOD'S SAKE TAKE ME TO HIS HOUSE I WILL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH BUT HAVE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN ME AND BE GOOD ENOUGH TO HEAR ME I ADVISE YOU NOT TO GO TO HIS HOUSE
3230-137483-0055 HE HAS ALREADY DONE YOU GREAT INJURY AND EVEN SUPPOSING THAT YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO FIND HIM AT HOME HE MIGHT BE CAPABLE OF RECEIVING YOU BADLY IF HE SHOULD NOT BE AT HOME IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT HIS MOTHER WOULD NOT EXACTLY WELCOME YOU
3230-137483-0056 IF YOU SHOULD TELL HER WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT IS YOUR ERRAND TRUST TO ME AND BE QUITE CERTAIN THAT GOD HAS SENT ME ON YOUR WAY TO ASSIST YOU I PROMISE YOU THAT TO MORROW AT THE LATEST YOU SHALL KNOW WHETHER STEFFANI IS IN VENICE WHAT HE INTENDS TO DO WITH YOU
3230-137483-0057 AND WHAT WE MAY COMPEL HIM TO DO UNTIL THEN MY ADVICE IS NOT TO LET HIM KNOW YOUR ARRIVAL IN VENICE GOOD GOD WHERE SHALL I GO TO NIGHT TO A RESPECTABLE HOUSE OF COURSE I WILL GO TO YOURS IF YOU ARE MARRIED
3230-137483-0058 I AM A BACHELOR I KNEW AN HONEST WIDOW WHO RESIDED IN A LANE AND WHO HAD TWO FURNISHED ROOMS I PERSUADE THE YOUNG COUNTESS TO FOLLOW ME AND WE TAKE A GONDOLA
3230-137483-0059 I WAS UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH SHE CONTINUED TO INSPIRE HIM WITH LOVE AND HE POSTPONED HIS DEPARTURE HE REMAINED ONE MONTH IN C NEVER GOING OUT BUT IN THE EVENING AND SPENDING EVERY NIGHT UNDER MY WINDOWS CONVERSING WITH ME
3230-137483-0060 HE SWORE A THOUSAND TIMES THAT HE ADORED ME THAT HIS INTENTIONS WERE HONOURABLE I ENTREATED HIM TO PRESENT HIMSELF TO MY PARENTS TO ASK ME IN MARRIAGE
3230-137483-0061 BUT HE ALWAYS EXCUSED HIMSELF BY ALLEGING SOME REASON GOOD OR BAD ASSURING ME THAT HE COULD NOT BE HAPPY UNLESS I SHEWED HIM ENTIRE CONFIDENCE HE WOULD BEG OF ME TO MAKE UP MY MIND TO RUN AWAY WITH HIM
3230-137483-0062 SHORTLY AFTER OUR MARRIAGE ALAS SIR WHAT SHALL I SAY NOW LOVE BLINDED ME I FELL INTO THE ABYSS I BELIEVED HIM I AGREED TO EVERYTHING HE GAVE ME THE PAPER WHICH YOU HAVE READ
3230-137483-0063 AND THE FOLLOWING NIGHT I ALLOWED HIM TO COME INTO MY ROOM THROUGH THE WINDOW UNDER WHICH HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF CONVERSING WITH ME I CONSENTED TO BE GUILTY OF A CRIME WHICH I BELIEVED WOULD BE ATONED FOR WITHIN THREE DAYS AND HE LEFT ME
3230-137483-0064 PROMISING THAT THE NEXT NIGHT HE WOULD BE AGAIN UNDER MY WINDOW READY TO RECEIVE ME IN HIS ARMS COULD I POSSIBLY ENTERTAIN ANY DOUBT AFTER THE FEARFUL CRIME I HAD COMMITTED FOR HIM I PREPARED A SMALL PARCEL AND WAITED FOR HIS COMING
3230-137483-0065 BUT IN VAIN OH WHAT A CRUEL LONG NIGHT IT WAS IN THE MORNING I HEARD THAT THE MONSTER HAD GONE AWAY WITH HIS SERVANT ONE HOUR AFTER SEALING MY SHAME YOU MAY IMAGINE MY DESPAIR I ADOPTED THE ONLY PLAN THAT DESPAIR COULD SUGGEST
3230-137483-0066 AND THAT OF COURSE WAS NOT THE RIGHT ONE ONE HOUR BEFORE MIDNIGHT I LEFT MY FATHER'S ROOF ALONE THUS COMPLETING MY DISHONOUR
3230-137483-0067 BUT RESOLVED ON DEATH IF THE MAN WHO HAS CRUELLY ROBBED ME OF MY MOST PRECIOUS TREASURE AND WHOM A NATURAL INSTINCT TOLD ME I COULD FIND HERE DOES NOT RESTORE ME THE HONOUR WHICH HE ALONE CAN GIVE ME BACK I WALKED ALL NIGHT AND NEARLY THE WHOLE DAY WITHOUT TAKING ANY FOOD
3230-137483-0068 UNTIL I GOT INTO THE BARGE WHICH BROUGHT ME HERE IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS I TRAVELLED IN THE BOAT WITH FIVE MEN AND TWO WOMEN BUT NO ONE SAW MY FACE OR HEARD MY VOICE I KEPT CONSTANTLY SITTING DOWN IN A CORNER HOLDING MY HEAD DOWN HALF ASLEEP
3230-137483-0069 AND WITH THIS PRAYER BOOK IN MY HANDS I WAS LEFT ALONE NO ONE SPOKE TO ME AND I THANKED GOD FOR IT WHEN I LANDED ON THE WHARF YOU DID NOT GIVE ME TIME TO THINK HOW I COULD FIND OUT THE DWELLING OF MY PERFIDIOUS SEDUCER
3230-137483-0070 BUT YOU MAY IMAGINE THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED UPON ME BY THE SUDDEN APPARITION OF A MASKED MAN WHO ABRUPTLY AND AS IF PLACED THERE PURPOSELY BY PROVIDENCE OFFERED ME HIS SERVICES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT YOU HAD GUESSED MY DISTRESS
3230-137483-0071 AND FAR FROM EXPERIENCING ANY REPUGNANCE I FELT THAT I WAS ACTING RIGHTLY IN TRUSTING MYSELF IN YOUR HANDS IN SPITE OF ALL PRUDENCE WHICH PERHAPS
3230-137483-0072 OUGHT TO HAVE MADE ME TURN A DEAF EAR TO YOUR WORDS AND REFUSE THE INVITATION TO ENTER ALONE WITH YOU THE HOUSE TO WHICH YOU TOOK ME YOU KNOW ALL NOW SIR BUT I ENTREAT YOU NOT TO JUDGE ME TOO SEVERELY I HAVE BEEN VIRTUOUS ALL THROUGH MY LIFE
3230-137483-0073 ONE MONTH AGO I HAD NEVER COMMITTED A FAULT WHICH COULD CALL A BLUSH UPON MY FACE AND THE BITTER TEARS WHICH I SHED EVERY DAY WILL I HOPE WASH OUT MY CRIME IN THE EYES OF GOD I HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY BROUGHT UP BUT LOVE AND THE WANT OF EXPERIENCE
3230-137483-0074 HAVE THROWN ME INTO THE ABYSS I AM IN YOUR HANDS AND I FEEL CERTAIN THAT I SHALL HAVE NO CAUSE TO REPENT IT I NEEDED ALL SHE HAD JUST TOLD ME TO CONFIRM ME IN THE INTEREST WHICH I HAD FELT IN HER FROM THE FIRST MOMENT
3230-137483-0075 I TOLD HER UNSPARINGLY THAT STEFFANI HAD SEDUCED AND ABANDONED HER OF MALICE AFORETHOUGHT AND THAT SHE OUGHT TO THINK OF HIM ONLY TO BE REVENGED OF HIS PERFIDY MY WORDS MADE HER SHUDDER AND SHE BURIED HER BEAUTIFUL FACE IN HER HANDS WE REACHED THE WIDOW'S HOUSE
3230-137483-0076 I THEN TOOK AN AFFECTIONATE LEAVE OF HER PROMISING TO SEE HER EARLY IN THE MORNING ON LEAVING THIS INTERESTING BUT HAPLESS GIRL I PROCEEDED TO THE HOUSE OF STEFFANI
3230-137483-0077 I HEARD FROM ONE OF HIS MOTHER'S GONDOLIERS THAT HE HAD RETURNED TO VENICE THREE DAYS BEFORE BUT THAT TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD GONE AWAY AGAIN WITHOUT ANY SERVANT AND NOBODY KNEW HIS WHEREABOUTS NOT EVEN HIS MOTHER THE SAME EVENING
3230-137483-0078 HAPPENING TO BE SEATED NEXT TO AN ABBE FROM BOLOGNA AT THE THEATRE I ASKED HIM SEVERAL QUESTIONS RESPECTING THE FAMILY OF MY UNFORTUNATE PROTEGEE THE ABBE BEING INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH THEM
3230-137483-0079 I GATHERED FROM HIM ALL THE INFORMATION I REQUIRED AND AMONGST OTHER THINGS I HEARD THAT THE YOUNG COUNTESS HAD A BROTHER THEN AN OFFICER IN THE PAPAL SERVICE VERY EARLY THE NEXT MORNING I CALLED UPON HER SHE WAS STILL ASLEEP THE WIDOW TOLD ME THAT SHE HAD MADE A PRETTY GOOD SUPPER
3230-137483-0080 AS SOON AS SHE HAD OPENED HER DOOR I ENTERED HER ROOM AND CUTTING SHORT HER APOLOGIES FOR HAVING KEPT ME WAITING I INFORMED HER OF ALL I HAD HEARD HER FEATURES BORE THE STAMP OF DEEP SORROW BUT SHE LOOKED CALMER AND HER COMPLEXION WAS NO LONGER PALE
3230-137483-0081 WITHOUT GIVING HER TIME TO ANSWER I TOLD HER ALL THE PARTICULARS I HAD LEARNED CONCERNING HER HONOURABLE FAMILY WHICH CAUSED HER REAL SATISFACTION I HAVE NO OBJECTION SHE SAID TO YOUR GOING TO C AND I THANK YOU FOR THE GENEROSITY OF YOUR OFFER
3230-137483-0082 BUT I BEG YOU WILL POSTPONE YOUR JOURNEY I STILL HOPE THAT STEFFANI WILL RETURN AND THEN I CAN TAKE A DECISION
3230-137483-0083 WILL YOU ALLOW ME TO HAVE SOME BREAKFAST WITH YOU
3230-137483-0084 I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY TO DISTURB YOU IN ANY WAY HOW DID YOU USE TO AMUSE YOURSELF AT HOME I AM VERY FOND OF BOOKS AND MUSIC MY HARPSICHORD WAS MY DELIGHT
3230-137483-0085 I LEFT HER AFTER BREAKFAST AND IN THE EVENING I CAME BACK WITH A BASKET FULL OF GOOD BOOKS AND MUSIC AND I SENT HER AN EXCELLENT HARPSICHORD MY KINDNESS CONFUSED HER BUT I SURPRISED HER MUCH MORE WHEN I TOOK OUT OF MY POCKET THREE PAIRS OF SLIPPERS
3230-137483-0086 SHE BLUSHED AND THANKED ME WITH GREAT FEELING SHE HAD WALKED A LONG DISTANCE HER SHOES WERE EVIDENTLY WORN OUT HER FEET SORE AND SHE APPRECIATED THE DELICACY OF MY PRESENT AS I HAD NO IMPROPER DESIGN WITH REGARD TO HER I ENJOYED HER GRATITUDE
3230-137483-0087 AND FELT PLEASED AT THE IDEA SHE EVIDENTLY ENTERTAINED OF MY KIND ATTENTIONS I HAD NO OTHER PURPOSE IN VIEW BUT TO RESTORE CALM TO HER MIND AND TO OBLITERATE THE BAD OPINION WHICH THE UNWORTHY STEFFANI HAD GIVEN HER OF MEN IN GENERAL
3230-137483-0088 I NEVER THOUGHT OF INSPIRING HER WITH LOVE FOR ME AND I HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA THAT I COULD FALL IN LOVE WITH HER SHE WAS UNHAPPY AND HER UNHAPPINESS A SACRED THING IN MY EYES
3230-137483-0089 SITUATED AS SHE WAS I COULD NOT SUPPOSE HER HEART SUSCEPTIBLE OF HARBOURING A NEW AFFECTION AND I WOULD HAVE DESPISED MYSELF IF I HAD TRIED TO SEDUCE HER BY ANY MEANS IN MY POWER I REMAINED WITH HER ONLY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
3230-137483-0090 I WAS THUS ENGAGED IN A RATHER DELICATE ADVENTURE THE END OF WHICH I COULD NOT POSSIBLY FORESEE BUT MY WARMTH FOR MY PROTEGEE DID NOT COOL DOWN AND HAVING NO DIFFICULTY IN PROCURING THE MEANS TO KEEP HER I HAD NO WISH TO SEE THE LAST SCENE OF THE ROMANCE
3230-137483-0091 THAT SINGULAR MEETING WHICH GAVE ME THE USEFUL OPPORTUNITY OF FINDING MYSELF ENDOWED WITH GENEROUS DISPOSITIONS
3230-137483-0092 WHEN I APPEARED BEFORE HER WITH A MASK ON MY FACE IN A COSTUME WHICH DID NOT INDICATE A VERY VIRTUOUS CHARACTER IT WAS EASY FOR ME MADAM I CONTINUED TO GUESS THAT YOU WERE A BEAUTY IN DISTRESS WHEN I OBSERVED YOUR YOUTH THE NOBLENESS OF YOUR COUNTENANCE
3230-137483-0093 AND MORE THAN ALL YOUR CANDOUR THE STAMP OF TRUTH WAS SO WELL AFFIXED TO THE FIRST WORDS YOU UTTERED THAT I COULD NOT HAVE THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT LEFT IN ME AS TO YOUR BEING THE UNHAPPY VICTIM OF THE MOST NATURAL OF ALL FEELINGS AND AS TO YOUR HAVING ABANDONED YOUR HOME THROUGH A SENTIMENT OF HONOUR
3230-137483-0094 YOUR FAULT WAS THAT OF A WARM HEART SEDUCED BY LOVE OVER WHICH REASON COULD HAVE NO SWAY AND YOUR FLIGHT THE ACTION OF A SOUL CRYING FOR REPARATION OR FOR REVENGE FULLY JUSTIFIES YOU
3230-137483-0095 YOUR COWARDLY SEDUCER MUST PAY WITH HIS LIFE THE PENALTY DUE TO HIS CRIME AND HE OUGHT NEVER TO RECEIVE BY MARRYING YOU AN UNJUST REWARD
3230-137483-0096 EVERYTHING YOU SAY IS TRUE MY BROTHER I HOPE WILL AVENGE ME YOU ARE GREATLY MISTAKEN IF YOU IMAGINE THAT STEFFANI WILL FIGHT YOUR BROTHER STEFFANI IS A COWARD WHO WILL NEVER EXPOSE HIMSELF TO AN HONOURABLE DEATH AS I WAS SPEAKING
3230-137483-0097 SHE PUT HER HAND IN HER POCKET AND DREW FORTH AFTER A FEW MOMENTS CONSIDERATION A STILETTO SIX INCHES LONG WHICH SHE PLACED ON THE TABLE
3230-137483-0098 BUT YOU HAVE OPENED MY EYES TAKE AWAY I ENTREAT YOU THIS STILETTO WHICH HENCEFORTH IS USELESS TO ME I TRUST IN YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND I HAVE AN INWARD CERTAINTY THAT I SHALL BE INDEBTED TO YOU FOR MY HONOUR AS WELL AS FOR MY LIFE
3230-137483-0099 I WAS STRUCK BY THE WORDS SHE HAD JUST UTTERED AND I FELT THAT THOSE WORDS AS WELL AS HER LOOKS HAD FOUND THEIR WAY TO MY HEART BESIDES ENLISTING MY GENEROUS SYMPATHY I TOOK THE STILETTO
3230-137483-0100 AND LEFT HER WITH SO MUCH AGITATION THAT I HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WEAKNESS OF MY HEROISM WHICH I WAS VERY NEAR TURNING INTO RIDICULE YET I HAD THE WONDERFUL STRENGTH TO PERFORM AT LEAST BY HALVES THE CHARACTER OF A CATO UNTIL THE SEVENTH DAY
3230-137483-0101 I MUST EXPLAIN HOW A CERTAIN SUSPICION OF THE YOUNG LADY AROSE IN MY MIND THAT DOUBT WAS HEAVY ON MY HEART FOR IF IT HAD PROVED TRUE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN A DUPE AND THE IDEA WAS HUMILIATING SHE HAD TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS A MUSICIAN
3230-137483-0102 SHE HAD NOT OPENED IT ONCE FOR THE WIDOW HAD TOLD ME SO IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE BEST WAY TO THANK ME FOR MY ATTENTIVE KINDNESS WOULD HAVE BEEN TO GIVE ME A SPECIMEN OF HER MUSICAL TALENT HAD SHE DECEIVED ME IF SO SHE WOULD LOSE MY ESTEEM
3230-137483-0103 BUT UNWILLING TO FORM A HASTY JUDGMENT I KEPT ON MY GUARD WITH A FIRM DETERMINATION TO MAKE GOOD USE OF THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT MIGHT PRESENT ITSELF TO CLEAR UP MY DOUBTS I CALLED UPON HER THE NEXT DAY AFTER DINNER
3230-137483-0104 WHICH WAS NOT MY USUAL TIME HAVING RESOLVED ON CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY MYSELF I CAUGHT HER SEATED BEFORE A TOILET GLASS WHILE THE WIDOW DRESSED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AUBURN HAIR I HAD EVER SEEN I TENDERED MY APOLOGIES FOR MY SUDDEN APPEARANCE AT AN UNUSUAL HOUR
3230-137483-0105 SHE EXCUSED HERSELF FOR NOT HAVING COMPLETED HER TOILET AND THE WIDOW WENT ON WITH HER WORK IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD SEEN THE WHOLE OF HER FACE HER NECK AND HALF OF HER ARMS WHICH THE GRACES THEMSELVES HAD MOULDED I REMAINED IN SILENT CONTEMPLATION
3230-137483-0106 I PRAISED QUITE BY CHANCE THE PERFUME OF THE POMATUM AND THE WIDOW TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF TELLING HER THAT SHE HAD SPENT IN COMBS POWDER AND POMATUM THE THREE LIVRES SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM HER
3230-137483-0107 I BLUSHED FOR VERY SHAME FOR I OUGHT TO HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT AS SOON AS THE WIDOW HAD DRESSED HER HAIR SHE LEFT THE ROOM TO PREPARE SOME COFFEE FOR US I TOOK UP A RING WHICH HAD BEEN LAID BY HER ON THE TOILET TABLE
3230-137483-0108 AND I SAW THAT IT CONTAINED A PORTRAIT EXACTLY LIKE HER
3230-137483-0109 WITH BLACK HAIR YOU ARE MISTAKEN SHE SAID IT IS A PORTRAIT OF MY BROTHER HE IS TWO YEARS OLDER THAN I AND IS AN OFFICER IN THE PAPAL ARMY I BEGGED HER PERMISSION TO PUT THE RING ON HER FINGER SHE CONSENTED
3230-137483-0110 AND WHEN I TRIED OUT OF MERE GALLANTRY TO KISS HER HAND SHE DREW IT BACK BLUSHING I FEARED SHE MIGHT BE OFFENDED AND I ASSURED HER OF MY RESPECT AH SIR SHE ANSWERED IN THE SITUATION IN WHICH I AM PLACED
3230-137483-0111 I MUST THINK OF DEFENDING MYSELF AGAINST MY OWN SELF MUCH MORE THAN AGAINST YOU THE COMPLIMENT STRUCK ME AS SO FINE AND SO COMPLIMENTARY TO ME THAT I THOUGHT IT BETTER NOT TO TAKE IT UP
3230-137483-0112 YET I FELT MY LOVE TAKING SUCH PROPORTIONS THAT I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO KEEP IT A MYSTERY ANY LONGER SOON AFTER THAT
3230-137483-0113 AS SHE WAS AGAIN THANKING ME FOR THE BOOKS I HAD GIVEN HER SAYING THAT I HAD GUESSED HER TASTE EXACTLY BECAUSE SHE DID NOT LIKE NOVELS SHE ADDED I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY FOR NOT HAVING SUNG TO YOU YET KNOWING THAT YOU ARE FOND OF MUSIC THESE WORDS
3230-137483-0114 MADE ME BREATHE FREELY WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY ANSWER SHE SAT DOWN BEFORE THE INSTRUMENT AND PLAYED SEVERAL PIECES WITH A FACILITY WITH A PRECISION WITH AN EXPRESSION OF WHICH
3230-137483-0115 I WAS IN ECSTACY I ENTREATED HER TO SING AFTER SOME LITTLE CEREMONY
3230-137483-0116 AND SHE SANG AT SIGHT IN A MANNER WHICH FAIRLY RAVISHED ME I BEGGED THAT SHE WOULD ALLOW ME TO KISS HER HAND AND SHE DID NOT SAY YES BUT WHEN I TOOK IT AND PRESSED MY LIPS ON IT SHE DID NOT OPPOSE ANY RESISTANCE
3230-137483-0117 I HAD THE COURAGE TO SMOTHER MY ARDENT DESIRES AND THE KISS I IMPRINTED ON HER LOVELY HAND WAS A MIXTURE OF TENDERNESS RESPECT AND ADMIRATION I TOOK LEAVE OF HER SMITTEN FULL OF LOVE
3230-137483-0118 AND ALMOST DETERMINED ON DECLARING MY PASSION
