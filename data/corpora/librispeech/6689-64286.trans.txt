6689-64286-0000 AT LENGTH ONE MORNING WHEN SHE BELIEVED MISSUS REDMAIN WOULD NOT RISE BEFORE NOON MARY FELT SHE MUST GO AND SEE LETTY SHE DID NOT FIND HER IN THE QUARTERS WHERE SHE HAD LEFT HER BUT A STORY HIGHER
6689-64286-0001 IN A MEAN ROOM SITTING WITH HER HANDS IN HER LAP SHE DID NOT LIFT HER EYES WHEN MARY ENTERED WHERE HOPE IS DEAD CURIOSITY DIES NOT UNTIL SHE HAD COME QUITE NEAR DID SHE RAISE HER HEAD
6689-64286-0002 AND THEN SHE SEEMED TO KNOW NOTHING OF HER WHEN SHE DID RECOGNIZE HER SHE HELD OUT HER HAND IN A MECHANICAL WAY AS IF THEY WERE TWO SPECTERS MET IN A MISERABLE DREAM IN WHICH THEY WERE NOTHING TO EACH OTHER AND NEITHER COULD DO
6689-64286-0003 OR CARED TO DO ANYTHING FOR THE OTHER MY POOR LETTY
6689-64286-0004 HAS ANYTHING HAPPENED TO TOM SHE BROKE INTO A LOW CHILDISH WAIL AND FOR A TIME THAT WAS ALL MARY HEARD PRESENTLY HOWEVER SHE BECAME AWARE OF A FEEBLE MOANING IN THE ADJOINING CHAMBER
6689-64286-0005 THE SOUND OF A HUMAN SEA IN TROUBLE MIXED WITH A WANDERING BABBLE WHICH TO LETTY WAS BUT AS THE VOICE OF HER OWN DESPAIR AND TO MARY WAS A CRY FOR HELP SHE ABANDONED THE ATTEMPT TO DRAW ANYTHING FROM LETTY
6689-64286-0006 AND WENT INTO THE NEXT ROOM THE DOOR OF WHICH STOOD WIDE THERE LAY TOM BUT SO CHANGED THAT MARY TOOK A MOMENT TO BE CERTAIN IT WAS HE GOING SOFTLY TO HIM SHE LAID HER HAND ON HIS HEAD
6689-64286-0007 IT WAS BURNING HE OPENED HIS EYES BUT SHE SAW THEIR SENSE WAS GONE SHE WENT BACK TO LETTY AND SITTING DOWN BESIDE HER PUT HER ARM ABOUT HER AND SAID WHY DIDN'T YOU SEND FOR ME LETTY
6689-64286-0008 I WILL COME NOW TO NIGHT AND HELP YOU TO NURSE HIM WHERE IS THE BABY LETTY GAVE A SHRIEK AND STARTING FROM HER CHAIR WALKED WILDLY ABOUT THE ROOM WRINGING HER HANDS MARY WENT AFTER HER
6689-64286-0009 AND TAKING HER IN HER ARMS SAID LETTY DEAR HAS GOD TAKEN YOUR BABY LETTY GAVE HER A LACK LUSTER LOOK THEN SAID MARY HE IS NOT FAR AWAY
6689-64286-0010 FOR WE ARE ALL IN GOD'S ARMS BUT WHAT IS THE USE OF THE MOST SOVEREIGN OF MEDICINES WHILE THEY STAND ON THE SICK MAN'S TABLE WHAT IS THE MIGHTIEST OF TRUTHS SO LONG AS IT IS NOT BELIEVED
6689-64286-0011 THE SPIRITUALLY SICK STILL MOCKS AT THE MEDICINE OFFERED HE WILL NOT KNOW ITS CURE MARY SAW THAT FOR ANY COMFORT TO LETTY GOD WAS NOWHERE IT WENT TO HER VERY HEART
6689-64286-0012 DEATH AND DESOLATION AND THE ENEMY WERE IN POSSESSION SHE TURNED TO GO THAT SHE MIGHT RETURN ABLE TO BEGIN HER CONTEST WITH RUIN LETTY SAW THAT SHE WAS GOING AND IMAGINED HER OFFENDED AND ABANDONING HER TO HER MISERY
6689-64286-0013 SHE FLEW TO HER STRETCHING OUT HER ARMS LIKE A CHILD BUT WAS SO FEEBLE THAT SHE TRIPPED AND FELL MARY LIFTED HER AND LAID HER WAILING ON HER COUCH LETTY SAID MARY
6689-64286-0014 BUT I MUST GO FOR AN HOUR PERHAPS TWO TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR STAYING WITH YOU
6689-64286-0015 THEN LETTY CLASPED HER HANDS IN HER OLD BESEECHING WAY AND LOOKED UP WITH A FAINT SHOW OF COMFORT
6689-64286-0016 SHE DROVE STRAIGHT HOME AND HEARD THAT MISSUS REDMAIN WAS ANNOYED THAT SHE HAD GONE OUT I OFFERED TO DRESS HER SAID JEMIMA AND SHE KNOWS I CAN QUITE WELL BUT SHE WOULD NOT GET UP TILL YOU CAME
6689-64286-0017 AND MADE ME FETCH HER A BOOK SO THERE SHE IS A WAITING FOR YOU I AM SORRY SAID MARY BUT I HAD TO GO AND SHE WAS FAST ASLEEP WHEN SHE ENTERED HER ROOM
6689-64286-0018 HESPER GAVE HER A COLD GLANCE OVER THE TOP OF HER NOVEL AND WENT ON WITH HER READING MARY PROCEEDED TO GET HER THINGS READY FOR DRESSING BUT BY THIS TIME SHE HAD GOT INTERESTED IN THE STORY I SHALL NOT GET UP YET
6689-64286-0019 SHE SAID THEN PLEASE MA'AM REPLIED MARY WOULD YOU MIND LETTING JEMIMA DRESS YOU I WANT TO GO OUT AGAIN AND SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU COULD DO WITHOUT ME FOR SOME DAYS MY FRIEND'S BABY IS DEAD
6689-64286-0020 AND BOTH SHE AND HER HUSBAND ARE VERY ILL HESPER THREW DOWN HER BOOK AND HER EYES FLAMED
6689-64286-0021 SHE SAID I AM VERY SORRY TO PUT YOU TO INCONVENIENCE ANSWERED MARY BUT THE HUSBAND SEEMS DYING AND THE WIFE IS SCARCELY ABLE TO CRAWL I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT INTERRUPTED HESPER
6689-64286-0022 FOR ME TO PART WITH MY MAID YOU UNDERTOOK TO PERFORM HER DUTIES I DID NOT ENGAGE YOU AS A SICK NURSE FOR OTHER PEOPLE NO MA'AM REPLIED MARY BUT THIS IS AN EXTREME CASE
6689-64286-0023 HOW PRAY IS THE WORLD TO GO ON IF THIS KIND OF THING BE PERMITTED I MAY BE GOING OUT TO DINNER OR TO THE OPERA TO NIGHT
6689-64286-0024 NO ON PRINCIPLE AND FOR THE SAKE OF EXAMPLE I WILL NOT LET YOU GO I THOUGHT SAID MARY NOT A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN HESPER
6689-64286-0025 I DID NOT STAND TO YOU QUITE IN THE RELATION OF AN ORDINARY SERVANT CERTAINLY YOU DO NOT
6689-64286-0026 UNGRATEFUL CREATURE WHO THINKS ONLY OF HERSELF BUT YOU ARE ALL ALIKE MORE AND MORE DISTRESSED TO FIND ONE SHE HAD LOVED SO LONG SHOW HERSELF SO SELFISH MARY'S INDIGNATION HAD ALMOST GOT THE BETTER OF HER
6689-64286-0027 BUT A LITTLE HEIGHTENING OF HER COLOR WAS ALL THE SHOW IT MADE INDEED IT IS QUITE NECESSARY MA'AM SHE PERSISTED THAT I SHOULD GO THE LAW HAS FORTUNATELY MADE PROVISION AGAINST SUCH BEHAVIOR
6689-64286-0028 SAID HESPER YOU CAN NOT LEAVE WITHOUT GIVING ME A MONTH'S NOTICE THE UNDERSTANDING ON WHICH I CAME TO YOU WAS VERY DIFFERENT SAID MARY SADLY IT WAS BUT SINCE THEN
6689-64286-0029 YOU CONSENTED TO BECOME MY MAID IT IS UNGENEROUS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT RETURNED MARY GROWING ANGRY AGAIN I HAVE TO PROTECT MYSELF AND THE WORLD IN GENERAL
6689-64286-0030 FROM THE CONSEQUENCES THAT MUST FOLLOW WERE SUCH LAWLESS BEHAVIOR ALLOWED TO PASS HESPER SPOKE WITH CALM SEVERITY AND MARY MAKING UP HER MIND ANSWERED NOW WITH ALMOST EQUAL CALMNESS
6689-64286-0031 THE LAW WAS MADE FOR BOTH SIDES MA'AM AND AS YOU BRING THE LAW TO ME I WILL TAKE REFUGE IN THE LAW IT IS I BELIEVE A MONTH'S WARNING OR A MONTH'S WAGES
6689-64286-0032 AND AS I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY WAGES I IMAGINE I AM AT LIBERTY TO GO GOOD BY MA'AM HESPER MADE HER NO ANSWER AND MARY LEFT THE ROOM SHE WENT TO HER OWN
6689-64286-0033 STUFFED HER IMMEDIATE NECESSITIES INTO A BAG LET HERSELF OUT OF THE HOUSE CALLED A CAB AND WITH A GREAT LUMP IN HER THROAT DROVE TO THE HELP OF LETTY FIRST SHE HAD A TALK WITH THE LANDLADY AND LEARNED ALL SHE COULD TELL
6689-64286-0034 THEN SHE WENT UP AND BEGAN TO MAKE THINGS AS COMFORTABLE AS SHE COULD ALL WAS IN SAD DISORDER AND NEGLECT WITH THE MERE INAUGURATION OF CLEANLINESS AND THE FIRST DAWN OF COMING ORDER
6689-64286-0035 THE COURAGE OF LETTY BEGAN TO REVIVE A LITTLE THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF DOING ALL THAT OUGHT TO BE DONE HAD IN HER MISERABLE WEAKNESS SO DEPRESSED HER THAT SHE HAD NOT DONE EVEN AS MUCH AS SHE COULD EXCEPT WHERE TOM WAS IMMEDIATELY CONCERNED
6689-64286-0036 THERE SHE HAD NOT FAILED OF HER UTMOST MARY NEXT WENT TO THE DOCTOR TO GET INSTRUCTIONS AND THEN TO BUY WHAT THINGS WERE MOST WANTED AND NOW SHE ALMOST WISHED MISSUS REDMAIN HAD PAID HER FOR HER SERVICES
6689-64286-0037 FOR SHE MUST WRITE TO MISTER TURNBULL FOR MONEY AND THAT SHE DISLIKED BUT BY THE VERY NEXT POST SHE RECEIVED INCLOSED IN A BUSINESS MEMORANDUM IN GEORGE'S WRITING THE CHECK FOR FIFTY POUNDS SHE HAD REQUESTED
6689-64286-0038 SHE DID NOT DARE WRITE TO TOM'S MOTHER BECAUSE SHE WAS CERTAIN WERE SHE TO COME UP HER PRESENCE WOULD ONLY ADD TO THE MISERY AND TAKE AWAY HALF THE PROBABILITY OF HIS RECOVERY AND OF LETTY'S TOO IN THE CASE OF BOTH
6689-64286-0039 NOURISHMENT WAS THE MAIN THING AND TO THE FIT PROVIDING AND THE ADMINISTERING OF IT SHE BENT HER ENERGY FOR A DAY OR TWO SHE FELT AT TIMES AS IF SHE COULD HARDLY GET THROUGH WHAT SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN
6689-64286-0040 BUT SHE SOON LEARNED TO DROP ASLEEP AT ANY MOMENT AND WAKE IMMEDIATELY WHEN SHE WAS WANTED AND THEREAFTER HER STRENGTH WAS BY NO MEANS SO SORELY TRIED UNDER HER SKILLFUL NURSING
6689-64286-0041 SKILLFUL NOT FROM EXPERIENCE BUT SIMPLY FROM HER FAITH WHENCE CAME BOTH CONSCIENCE OF AND CAPACITY FOR DOING WHAT THE DOCTOR TOLD HER THINGS WENT WELL IT IS FROM THEIR WANT OF THIS FAITH
6689-64286-0042 AND THEIR CONSEQUENT ARROGANCE AND CONCEIT THAT THE LADIES WHO ASPIRE TO HELP IN HOSPITALS GIVE THE DOCTORS SO MUCH TROUBLE THEY HAVE NOT YET LEARNED OBEDIENCE THE ONLY PATH TO ANY GOOD THE ONE ESSENTIAL TO THE SAVING OF THE WORLD
6689-64286-0043 ONE WHO CAN NOT OBEY IS THE MEREST SLAVE ESSENTIALLY AND IN HIMSELF A SLAVE THE CRISIS OF TOM'S FEVER WAS AT LENGTH FAVORABLY PASSED BUT THE RESULT REMAINED DOUBTFUL
6689-64286-0044 BY LATE HOURS AND STRONG DRINK HE HAD DONE NOT A LITTLE TO WEAKEN A CONSTITUTION IN ITSELF AS I HAVE SAID FAR FROM STRONG WHILE THE UNREST OF WHAT IS COMMONLY AND FOOLISHLY CALLED A BAD CONSCIENCE
6689-64286-0045 WITH MISERY OVER THE DEATH OF HIS CHILD AND THE CONDUCT WHICH HAD DISGRACED HIM IN HIS OWN EYES AND RUINED HIS WIFE'S HAPPINESS COMBINED TO RETARD HIS RECOVERY WHILE HE WAS YET DELIRIOUS
6689-64286-0046 AND GRIEF AND SHAME AND CONSTERNATION OPERATED AT WILL ON HIS POETIC NATURE THE THINGS HE KEPT SAYING OVER AND OVER WERE VERY PITIFUL BUT THEY WOULD HAVE SOUNDED MORE MISERABLE BY MUCH
6689-64286-0047 IN THE EARS OF ONE WHO DID NOT LOOK SO FAR AHEAD AS MARY SHE TRAINED TO REGARD ALL THINGS IN THEIR TRUE IMPORT WAS REJOICED TO FIND HIM LOATHING HIS FORMER SELF AND BEYOND THE PRESENT SUFFERING
6689-64286-0048 SAW THE GLADNESS AT HAND FOR THE SORROWFUL MAN THE REPENTING SINNER HAD SHE BEEN MOTHER OR SISTER TO HIM SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE WAITED ON HIM WITH MORE DEVOTION OR TENDERNESS ONE DAY
6689-64286-0049 AS HIS WIFE WAS DOING SOME LITTLE THING FOR HIM HE TOOK HER HAND IN HIS FEEBLE GRASP AND PRESSING IT TO HIS FACE WET WITH THE TEARS OF REVIVING MANHOOD SAID WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAPPY TOGETHER LETTY
6689-64286-0050 IF I HAD BUT KNOWN HOW MUCH YOU WERE WORTH AND HOW LITTLE I WAS WORTH MYSELF OH ME OH ME HE BURST INTO AN INCONTROLLABLE WAIL THAT TORTURED LETTY WITH ITS LIKENESS TO THE CRYING OF HER BABY
6689-64286-0051 SHE CRIED WHEN YOU SPEAK AS IF I BELONGED TO YOU IT MAKES ME AS HAPPY AS A QUEEN WHEN YOU ARE BETTER YOU WILL BE HAPPY TOO DEAR MARY SAYS YOU WILL O LETTY HE SOBBED THE BABY
6689-64286-0052 THE BABY'S ALL RIGHT MARY SAYS AND SOME DAY SHE SAYS HE WILL RUN INTO YOUR ARMS AND KNOW YOU FOR HIS FATHER
6689-64286-0053 SAID TOM AN HOUR OR SO AFTER HE WOKE FROM A SHORT SLEEP AND HIS EYES SOUGHT LETTY'S WATCHING FACE I HAVE SEEN BABY HE SAID
6689-64286-0054 AND HE HAS FORGIVEN ME I DARE SAY IT WAS ONLY A DREAM HE ADDED BUT SOMEHOW IT MAKES ME HAPPIER AT LEAST I KNOW HOW THE THING MIGHT BE IT WAS TRUE
6689-64286-0055 WHETHER IT WAS BUT A DREAM OR SOMETHING MORE SAID MARY WHO HAPPENED TO BE BY THANK YOU MARY HE RETURNED YOU AND LETTY HAVE SAVED ME FROM WHAT I DARE NOT THINK OF I COULD DIE HAPPY NOW
6689-64286-0056 IF IT WEREN'T FOR ONE THING WHAT IS THAT ASKED MARY
6689-64286-0057 HE REPLIED BUT I OUGHT TO SAY IT AND BEAR THE SHAME FOR THE MAN WHO DOES SHAMEFULLY OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED IT IS THAT WHEN I AM IN MY GRAVE OR SOMEWHERE ELSE
6689-64286-0058 FOR I KNOW MARY DOES NOT LIKE PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT BEING IN THEIR GRAVES YOU SAY IT IS HEATHENISH DON'T YOU MARY WHEN I AM WHERE THEY CAN'T FIND ME THEN IT IS HORRID TO THINK THAT PEOPLE UP HERE
6689-64286-0059 WILL HAVE A HOLD ON ME AND A RIGHT OVER ME STILL BECAUSE OF DEBTS I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO PAY THEM DON'T BE TOO SURE OF THAT TOM SAID MARY CHEERFULLY I THINK YOU WILL PAY THEM YET BUT I HAVE HEARD IT SAID
6689-64286-0060 SHE WENT ON THAT A MAN IN DEBT NEVER TELLS THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS DEBTS AS IF HE HAD ONLY THE FACE TO MAKE THEM NOT TO TALK ABOUT THEM CAN YOU MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT TOM I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
6689-64286-0061 BUT I ALWAYS DID MEAN TO PAY THEM AND I HAVE SOME IDEA ABOUT THEM I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD COME TO MORE THAN A HUNDRED POUNDS YOUR MOTHER WOULD NOT HESITATE TO PAY THAT FOR YOU SAID MARY
6689-64286-0062 I KNOW SHE WOULDN'T BUT THEN I'M THINKING OF LETTY HE PAUSED AND MARY WAITED YOU KNOW WHEN I AM GONE HE RESUMED THERE WILL BE NOTHING FOR HER BUT TO GO TO MY MOTHER
6689-64286-0063 AND IT BREAKS MY HEART TO THINK OF IT EVERY SIN OF MINE SHE WILL LAY TO HER CHARGE AND HOW AM I TO LIE STILL IN MY GRAVE OH I BEG YOUR PARDON MARY I WILL PAY YOUR DEBTS TOM AND GLADLY
6689-64286-0064 SAID MARY IF THEY DON'T COME TO MUCH MORE THAN YOU SAY THAN YOU THINK I MEAN BUT DON'T YOU SEE MARY
6689-64286-0065 AND FROM THAT DAY BEGAN TO RECOVER MANY WHO WOULD PAY MONEY TO KEEP A MAN ALIVE OR TO DELIVER HIM FROM PAIN WOULD PAY NOTHING TO TAKE A KILLING LOAD OFF THE SHOULDERS OF HIS MIND HUNGER THEY CAN PITY
6689-64286-0066 NOT MENTAL MISERY TOM WOULD NOT HEAR OF HIS MOTHER BEING WRITTEN TO I HAVE DONE LETTY WRONG ENOUGH ALREADY HE SAID WITHOUT SUBJECTING HER TO THE CRUEL TONGUE OF MY MOTHER
6689-64286-0067 BUT TOM EXPOSTULATED MARY IF YOU WANT TO BE GOOD ONE OF YOUR FIRST DUTIES IS TO BE RECONCILED TO YOUR MOTHER I AM VERY SORRY THINGS ARE ALL WRONG BETWEEN US MARY
6689-64286-0068 SAID TOM BUT IF YOU WANT HER TO COME HERE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SHE MUST HAVE EVERYTHING HER OWN WAY OR STORM FROM MORNING TO NIGHT I WOULD GLADLY MAKE IT UP WITH HER
6689-64286-0069 BUT LIVE WITH HER OR DIE WITH HER I COULD NOT TO MAKE EITHER POSSIBLE YOU MUST CONVERT HER TOO WHEN YOU HAVE DONE THAT I WILL INVITE HER AT ONCE NEVER MIND ME TOM
6689-64286-0070 SAID LETTY SO LONG AS YOU LOVE ME I DON'T CARE WHAT EVEN YOUR MOTHER THINKS OF ME I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE HER COMFORTABLE AND SATISFIED WITH ME WAIT TILL I AM BETTER ANYHOW LETTY
6689-64286-0071 FOR I SOLEMNLY ASSURE YOU I HAVEN'T A CHANCE IF MY MOTHER COMES I WILL TELL YOU WHAT MARY I PROMISE YOU IF I GET BETTER
6689-64286-0072 AND FOR THE PRESENT I WILL DICTATE A LETTER IF YOU WILL WRITE IT BIDDING HER GOOD BY AND ASKING HER PARDON FOR EVERYTHING I HAVE DONE WRONG BY HER WHICH YOU WILL PLEASE SEND IF I SHOULD DIE
6689-64286-0073 I CAN NOT AND I WILL NOT PROMISE MORE HE WAS EXCITED AND EXHAUSTED AND MARY DARED NOT SAY ANOTHER WORD NOR TRULY DID SHE AT THE MOMENT SEE WHAT MORE COULD BE SAID
6689-64286-0074 WHERE ALL RELATION HAS BEEN PERVERTED THINGS CAN NOT BE SET RIGHT BY FORCE PERHAPS ALL WE CAN DO SOMETIMES IS TO BE WILLING AND WAIT THE LETTER WAS DICTATED AND WRITTEN
6689-64286-0075 A LOVELY ONE MARY THOUGHT AND IT MADE HER WEEP AS SHE WROTE IT TOM SIGNED IT WITH HIS OWN HAND MARY FOLDED SEALED ADDRESSED IT AND LAID IT AWAY IN HER DESK
6689-64286-0076 THE SAME EVENING TOM SAID TO LETTY PUTTING HIS THIN LONG HAND IN HERS MARY THINKS WE SHALL KNOW EACH OTHER THERE LETTY TOM INTERRUPTED LETTY
