7687-107687-0000 CONSEQUENTLY NOT KNOWING WHAT HAD HAPPENED
7687-107687-0001 CHAFFING HIM BECAUSE HE HAD MISSED THE BIRD PRESENTLY THE MERCHANT WENT TO ASK HIS WIFE ABOUT SOMETHING AND FOUND HER LYING TO ALL APPEARANCE
7687-107687-0002 WITHIN HALF A YARD OF HER HEAD SUPPOSING THAT SHE WAS DEAD HE RUSHED TO THE WINDOW AND SHRIEKED THIEVES THIEVES THEY HAVE KILLED MY WIFE THE NEIGHBOURS QUICKLY GATHERED
7687-107687-0003 AND THE SERVANTS CAME RUNNING UPSTAIRS TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER IT HAPPENED THAT THE WOMAN HAD FAINTED AND THAT THERE WAS ONLY A VERY SLIGHT WOUND IN HER BREAST WHERE THE ARROW HAD GRAZED
7687-107687-0004 AS SOON AS THE WOMAN RECOVERED HER SENSES SHE TOLD THEM THAT TWO YOUNG MEN HAD PASSED BY THE PLACE WITH THEIR BOWS AND ARROWS AND THAT ONE OF THEM HAD MOST DELIBERATELY AIMED AT HER
7687-107687-0005 AS SHE STOOD BY THE WINDOW ON HEARING THIS THE MERCHANT WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE HIS MAJESTY WAS MUCH ENRAGED AT SUCH AUDACIOUS WICKEDNESS
7687-107687-0006 AND SWORE THAT MOST TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT SHOULD BE VISITED ON THE OFFENDER IF HE COULD BE DISCOVERED HE ORDERED THE MERCHANT TO GO BACK AND ASCERTAIN WHETHER HIS WIFE COULD RECOGNISE THE YOUNG MEN
7687-107687-0007 I WILL CAUSE ALL THE MALE INHABITANTS OF THIS CITY TO PASS BEFORE YOUR HOUSE AND YOUR WIFE WILL STAND AT THE WINDOW AND WATCH FOR THE MAN WHO DID THIS WANTON DEED
7687-107687-0008 A ROYAL PROCLAMATION WAS ISSUED TO THIS EFFECT SO THE NEXT DAY ALL THE MEN AND BOYS OF THE CITY FROM THE AGE OF TEN YEARS UPWARDS

7687-107687-0014 WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS CRUEL THING I SHOT AN ARROW AT A BIRD THAT WAS SITTING ON THE SILL OF AN OPEN WINDOW IN YONDER HOUSE AND MISSED ANSWERED THE PRINCE

7687-107687-0017 THE KING WISHED BOTH OF THEM TO BE EXECUTED
7687-107687-0018 THE PRINCE SHOULD BE BANISHED FROM THE COUNTRY THIS WAS FINALLY AGREED TO ACCORDINGLY ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING A LITTLE COMPANY OF SOLDIERS ESCORTED THE PRINCE OUT OF THE CITY
7687-107687-0019 WHEN THEY REACHED THE LAST CUSTOM HOUSE THE VIZIER'S SON OVERTOOK THEM HE HAD COME WITH ALL HASTE BRINGING WITH HIM FOUR BAGS OF MUHRS ON FOUR HORSES I AM COME HE SAID

7687-107687-0022 AND SHALL NEVER BE HAPPY WITHOUT YOU SO THE TWO FRIENDS WALKED ALONG HAND IN HAND AS FAST AS THEY COULD TO GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND BEHIND THEM MARCHED THE SOLDIERS AND THE HORSES
7687-107687-0023 WITH THEIR VALUABLE BURDENS ON REACHING A PLACE ON THE BORDERS OF THE KING'S DOMINIONS THE PRINCE GAVE THE SOLDIERS SOME GOLD AND ORDERED THEM TO RETURN THE SOLDIERS TOOK THE MONEY AND LEFT
7687-107687-0024 THEY DID NOT HOWEVER GO VERY FAR BUT HID THEMSELVES BEHIND ROCKS AND STONES AND WAITED TILL THEY WERE QUITE SURE THAT THE PRINCE DID NOT INTEND TO COME BACK ON AND ON THE EXILES WALKED
7687-107687-0025 TILL THEY ARRIVED AT A CERTAIN VILLAGE WHERE THEY DETERMINED TO SPEND THE NIGHT UNDER ONE OF THE BIG TREES OF THE PLACE THE PRINCE MADE PREPARATIONS FOR A FIRE AND ARRANGED THE FEW ARTICLES OF BEDDING THAT THEY HAD WITH THEM
7687-107687-0026 WENT TO THE BANIYA AND THE BAKER AND THE BUTCHER TO GET SOMETHING FOR THEIR DINNER FOR SOME REASON HE WAS DELAYED PERHAPS THE TSUT WAS NOT QUITE READY OR THE BANIYA
7687-107687-0027 HAD NOT GOT ALL THE SPICES PREPARED AFTER WAITING
7687-107687-0028 IMPATIENT AND ROSE UP AND WALKED ABOUT HE SAW A PRETTY CLEAR LITTLE BROOK RUNNING ALONG NOT FAR FROM THEIR RESTING PLACE AND HEARING THAT ITS SOURCE WAS NOT FAR DISTANT HE STARTED OFF TO FIND IT
7687-107687-0029 THE SOURCE WAS A BEAUTIFUL LAKE WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS COVERED WITH THE MAGNIFICENT LOTUS FLOWER AND OTHER WATER PLANTS THE PRINCE SAT DOWN ON THE BANK AND BEING THIRSTY
7687-107687-0030 TOOK UP SOME OF THE WATER IN HIS HAND FORTUNATELY HE LOOKED INTO HIS HAND BEFORE DRINKING AND THERE TO HIS GREAT ASTONISHMENT HE SAW REFLECTED WHOLE AND CLEAR THE IMAGE OF A BEAUTIFUL
7687-107687-0031 FAIRY HE LOOKED ROUND HOPING TO SEE THE REALITY BUT SEEING NO PERSON HE DRANK THE WATER AND PUT OUT HIS HAND TO TAKE SOME MORE AGAIN HE SAW THE REFLECTION IN THE WATER WHICH WAS IN HIS PALM
7687-107687-0032 HE LOOKED AROUND AS BEFORE AND THIS TIME DISCOVERED A FAIRY SITTING BY THE BANK ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE LAKE ON SEEING HER HE FELL SO MADLY IN LOVE WITH HER THAT HE DROPPED DOWN IN A SWOON
7687-107687-0033 RETURNED AND FOUND THE FIRE LIGHTED THE HORSES SECURELY FASTENED
7687-107687-0034 BUT NO PRINCE HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK HE WAITED A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SHOUTED
7687-107687-0035 THERE HE CAME ACROSS THE FOOTMARKS OF HIS FRIEND SEEING THESE HE WENT BACK AT ONCE FOR THE MONEY AND THE HORSES AND BRINGING THEM WITH HIM HE TRACKED THE PRINCE TO THE LAKE
7687-107687-0036 WHERE HE FOUND HIM LYING TO ALL APPEARANCE DEAD ALAS ALAS HE CRIED AND LIFTING UP THE PRINCE HE POURED SOME WATER OVER HIS HEAD AND FACE ALAS

7687-107687-0041 NEVER SAID THE VIZIER'S SON WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO SUDDENLY ESTRANGE YOU FROM ME A LITTLE WHILE AGO
7687-107687-0042 YOU DETEST THE SIGHT OF ME I HAVE LOOKED UPON A FAIRY THE PRINCE SAID BUT A MOMENT I SAW HER FACE FOR WHEN SHE NOTICED THAT I WAS LOOKING AT HER SHE COVERED HER FACE WITH LOTUS PETALS
7687-107687-0043 AND WHILE I GAZED SHE TOOK
7687-107687-0044 THEN I FAINTED OH IF YOU CAN GET ME THAT FAIRY FOR MY WIFE I WILL GO ANYWHERE WITH YOU OH BROTHER
7687-107687-0045 WHEN THE PRINCE HEARD THESE ENCOURAGING WORDS HE FELT MUCH COMFORTED ROSE UP AND ATE AND THEN WENT AWAY GLADLY WITH HIS FRIEND ON THE WAY THEY MET TWO MEN
7687-107687-0046 THESE TWO MEN BELONGED TO A FAMILY OF ROBBERS THERE WERE ELEVEN OF THEM ALTOGETHER ONE AN ELDER SISTER STAYED AT HOME AND COOKED THE FOOD AND THE OTHER TEN ALL BROTHERS
7687-107687-0047 WENT OUT TWO AND TWO AND WALKED ABOUT THE FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS THAT RAN THROUGH THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY ROBBING THOSE TRAVELLERS WHO COULD NOT RESIST THEM AND INVITING OTHERS WHO WERE TOO POWERFUL FOR TWO OF THEM
7687-107687-0048 TO MANAGE TO COME AND REST AT THEIR HOUSE WHERE THE WHOLE FAMILY ATTACKED THEM AND STOLE THEIR GOODS THESE THIEVES LIVED IN A KIND OF TOWER WHICH HAD SEVERAL STRONG ROOMS IN IT AND UNDER IT
7687-107687-0049 WAS A GREAT PIT WHEREIN THEY THREW THE CORPSES OF THE POOR UNFORTUNATES WHO CHANCED TO FALL INTO THEIR POWER THE TWO MEN CAME FORWARD AND POLITELY ACCOSTING THEM
7687-107687-0050 BEGGED THEM TO COME AND STAY AT THEIR HOUSE FOR THE NIGHT IT IS LATE THEY SAID AND THERE IS NOT ANOTHER VILLAGE WITHIN SEVERAL MILES SHALL WE ACCEPT THIS GOOD MAN'S INVITATION BROTHER ASKED THE PRINCE
7687-107687-0051 BUT THE PRINCE WAS TIRED AND THINKING THAT IT WAS ONLY A WHIM OF HIS FRIEND'S HE SAID TO THE MEN VERY WELL IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU TO ASK US SO THEY ALL FOUR WENT TO THE ROBBERS TOWER
7687-107687-0052 SEATED IN A ROOM WITH THE DOOR FASTENED ON THE OUTSIDE THE TWO TRAVELLERS BEMOANED THEIR FATE IT IS NO GOOD GROANING
7687-107687-0053 I WILL CLIMB TO THE WINDOW AND SEE WHETHER THERE ARE ANY MEANS OF ESCAPE YES YES HE WHISPERED WHEN HE HAD REACHED THE WINDOW HOLE

7687-107687-0058 THEY ALSO SHALL GO OUT BY THIS DOOR I HAVE A CHARM WHEREBY I CAN MAKE THEM THIN OR FAT SO THE VIZIER'S SON FETCHED THE HORSES WITHOUT ANY PERSON KNOWING IT
7687-107687-0059 AND REPEATING THE CHARM HE MADE THEM PASS THROUGH THE NARROW DOORWAY LIKE PIECES OF CLOTH AND WHEN THEY WERE ALL OUTSIDE RESTORED THEM
7687-107687-0060 HE AT ONCE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND LAID HOLD OF THE HALTER OF ONE OF THE OTHER HORSES AND THEN BECKONING TO THE PRINCE TO DO LIKEWISE HE RODE OFF THE PRINCE
7687-107687-0061 SAW HIS OPPORTUNITY AND IN A MOMENT WAS RIDING AFTER HIM HAVING THE WOMAN BEHIND HIM NOW THE ROBBERS HEARD THE GALLOPING OF THE HORSES AND RAN OUT AND SHOT THEIR ARROWS
7687-107687-0062 AT THE PRINCE AND HIS COMPANIONS AND ONE OF THE ARROWS KILLED THE WOMAN SO THEY HAD TO LEAVE HER BEHIND ON ON THEY RODE UNTIL THEY REACHED A VILLAGE WHERE THEY STAYED THE NIGHT
