4138-11079-0000 CHAPTER FOUR ON THE SPARTACUS THE ULSTER AND THE FELT HAT SOON CAME OFF AGAIN FOR A HEAD WIND LAY WAITING IN THE OFFING
4138-11079-0001 AND THE SPARTACUS BEGAN TO PITCH AND TOSS IN A MANNER WHICH MADE ALL HER UNSEASONED PASSENGERS GLAD TO BETAKE THEMSELVES TO THEIR BERTHS MISSUS ASHE AND AMY WERE AMONG THE EARLIEST VICTIMS OF SEA SICKNESS AND KATY AFTER HELPING THEM TO SETTLE IN THEIR STATEROOMS
4138-11079-0002 FOUND HERSELF TOO DIZZY AND ILL TO SIT UP A MOMENT LONGER AND THANKFULLY RESORTED TO HER OWN AS THE NIGHT CAME ON THE WIND GREW STRONGER AND THE MOTION WORSE THE SPARTACUS HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING A DREADFUL ROLLER
4138-11079-0003 DOWN DOWN DOWN THE GREAT HULL WOULD SLIDE TILL KATY WOULD HOLD HER BREATH WITH FEAR LEST IT MIGHT NEVER RIGHT ITSELF AGAIN THEN SLOWLY SLOWLY THE TURN WOULD BE MADE AND UP UP UP IT WOULD GO TILL THE CANT ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS EQUALLY ALARMING
4138-11079-0004 ON THE WHOLE KATY PREFERRED TO HAVE HER OWN SIDE OF THE SHIP THE DOWNWARD ONE FOR IT WAS LESS DIFFICULT TO KEEP HERSELF IN THE BERTH FROM WHICH SHE WAS IN CONTINUAL DANGER OF BEING THROWN
4138-11079-0005 THE NIGHT SEEMED ENDLESS FOR SHE WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO SLEEP EXCEPT IN BROKEN SNATCHES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED AND SHE LOOKED THROUGH THE LITTLE ROUND PANE OF GLASS IN THE PORT HOLE ONLY GRAY SKY AND GRAY WELTERING WAVES AND FLYING SPRAY AND RAIN MET HER VIEW
4138-11079-0006 OH DEAR WHY DO PEOPLE EVER GO TO SEA UNLESS THEY MUST SHE THOUGHT FEEBLY TO HERSELF SHE WANTED TO GET UP AND SEE HOW MISSUS ASHE HAD LIVED THROUGH THE NIGHT BUT THE ATTEMPT TO MOVE MADE HER SO MISERABLY ILL THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SINK AGAIN ON HER PILLOWS
4138-11079-0007 THE VERY IDEA OF WHICH WAS SIMPLY DREADFUL AND PRONOUNCED THE OTHER LADY ORRIDLY ILL WORSE THAN YOU ARE MISS AND THE LITTLE GIRL
4138-11079-0008 OF THIS FACT KATY SOON HAD AUDIBLE PROOF FOR AS HER DIZZY SENSES RALLIED A LITTLE SHE COULD HEAR AMY IN THE OPPOSITE STATEROOM CRYING AND SOBBING PITIFULLY SHE SEEMED TO BE ANGRY AS WELL AS SICK FOR SHE WAS SCOLDING HER POOR MOTHER IN THE MOST VEHEMENT FASHION
4138-11079-0009 I HATE BEING AT SEA KATY HEARD HER SAY I WON'T STAY IN THIS NASTY OLD SHIP
4138-11079-0010 IT WASN'T A BIT KIND OF YOU TO BRING ME TO SUCH A HORRID PLACE IT WAS VERY UNKIND IT WAS CRU EL I WANT TO GO BACK MAMMA TELL THE CAPTAIN TO TAKE ME BACK TO THE LAND MAMMA WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK TO ME OH I AM SO SICK AND SO VERY UN HAPPY
4138-11079-0011 DON'T YOU WISH YOU WERE DEAD I DO AND THEN CAME ANOTHER STORM OF SOBS BUT NEVER A SOUND FROM MISSUS ASHE WHO KATY SUSPECTED WAS TOO ILL TO SPEAK
4138-11079-0012 SHE FELT VERY SORRY FOR POOR LITTLE AMY RAGING THERE IN HER HIGH BERTH LIKE SOME IMPRISONED CREATURE BUT SHE WAS POWERLESS TO HELP HER SHE COULD ONLY RESIGN HERSELF TO HER OWN DISCOMFORTS AND TRY TO BELIEVE THAT SOMEHOW SOMETIME THIS STATE OF THINGS MUST MEND
4138-11079-0013 EITHER THEY SHOULD ALL GET TO LAND OR ALL GO TO THE BOTTOM AND BE DROWNED AND AT THAT MOMENT SHE DIDN'T CARE VERY MUCH WHICH IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE GALE INCREASED AS THE DAY WORE ON AND THE VESSEL PITCHED DREADFULLY TWICE KATY WAS THROWN OUT OF HER BERTH ON THE FLOOR
4138-11079-0014 THEN THE STEWARDESS CAME AND FIXED A SORT OF MOVABLE SIDE TO THE BERTH WHICH HELD HER IN BUT MADE HER FEEL LIKE A CHILD FASTENED INTO A RAILED CRIB AT INTERVALS SHE COULD STILL HEAR AMY CRYING AND SCOLDING HER MOTHER AND CONJECTURED THAT THEY WERE HAVING A DREADFUL TIME OF IT IN THE OTHER STATEROOM
4138-11079-0015 IT WAS ALL LIKE A BAD DREAM AND THEY CALL THIS TRAVELLING FOR PLEASURE THOUGHT POOR KATY ONE DROLL THING HAPPENED IN THE COURSE OF THE SECOND NIGHT AT LEAST IT SEEMED DROLL AFTERWARD AT THE TIME KATY WAS TOO UNCOMFORTABLE TO ENJOY IT
4138-11079-0016 AMID THE RUSH OF THE WIND THE CREAKING OF THE SHIP'S TIMBERS AND THE SHRILL BUZZ OF THE SCREW SHE HEARD A SOUND OF QUEER LITTLE FOOTSTEPS IN THE ENTRY OUTSIDE OF HER OPEN DOOR HOPPING AND LEAPING TOGETHER IN AN ODD IRREGULAR WAY LIKE A REGIMENT OF MICE OR TOY SOLDIERS
4138-11079-0017 NEARER AND NEARER THEY CAME AND KATY OPENING HER EYES SAW A PROCESSION OF BOOTS AND SHOES OF ALL SIZES AND SHAPES WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN LEFT ON THE FLOORS OR AT THE DOORS OF VARIOUS STATEROOMS AND WHICH IN OBEDIENCE TO THE LURCHINGS OF THE VESSEL HAD COLLECTED IN THE CABIN
4138-11079-0018 THEY NOW SEEMED TO BE ACTING IN CONCERT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND REALLY LOOKED ALIVE AS THEY BUMPED AND TROTTED SIDE BY SIDE AND TWO BY TWO IN AT THE DOOR AND UP CLOSE TO HER BEDSIDE THERE THEY REMAINED FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS EXECUTING WHAT LOOKED LIKE A DANCE
4138-11079-0019 THEN THE LEADING SHOE TURNED ON ITS HEEL AS IF GIVING A SIGNAL TO THE OTHERS AND THEY ALL HOPPED SLOWLY AGAIN INTO THE PASSAGE WAY AND DISAPPEARED IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE ONE OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN'S FAIRY TALES KATY WROTE TO CLOVER AFTERWARD
4138-11079-0020 SHE HEARD THEM GOING DOWN THE CABIN BUT HOW IT ENDED OR WHETHER THE OWNERS OF THE BOOTS AND SHOES EVER GOT THEIR OWN PARTICULAR PAIRS AGAIN SHE NEVER KNEW TOWARD MORNING THE GALE ABATED THE SEA BECAME SMOOTHER AND SHE DROPPED ASLEEP
4138-11079-0021 WHEN SHE WOKE THE SUN WAS STRUGGLING THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND SHE FELT BETTER THE STEWARDESS OPENED THE PORT HOLE TO FRESHEN THE AIR AND HELPED HER TO WASH HER FACE AND SMOOTH HER TANGLED HAIR THEN SHE PRODUCED A LITTLE BASIN OF GRUEL AND A TRIANGULAR BIT OF TOAST
4138-11079-0022 AND KATY FOUND THAT HER APPETITE WAS COME AGAIN AND SHE COULD EAT AND ERE'S A LETTER MA'AM WHICH HAS COME FOR YOU BY POST THIS MORNING SAID THE NICE OLD STEWARDESS PRODUCING AN ENVELOPE FROM HER POCKET
4138-11079-0023 BY POST CRIED KATY IN AMAZEMENT WHY HOW CAN THAT BE THEN CATCHING SIGHT OF ROSE'S HANDWRITING ON THE ENVELOPE SHE UNDERSTOOD AND SMILED AT HER OWN SIMPLICITY THE STEWARDESS BEAMED AT HER AS SHE OPENED IT THEN SAYING AGAIN
4138-11079-0024 YES M BY POST M'M WITHDREW AND LEFT KATY TO ENJOY THE LITTLE SURPRISE THE LETTER WAS NOT LONG BUT IT WAS VERY LIKE ITS WRITER ROSE DREW A PICTURE OF WHAT KATY WOULD PROBABLY BE DOING AT THE TIME IT REACHED HER
4138-11079-0025 A PICTURE SO NEAR THE TRUTH THAT KATY FELT AS IF ROSE MUST HAVE THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY ESPECIALLY AS SHE KINDLY ILLUSTRATED THE SITUATION WITH A SERIES OF PEN AND INK DRAWINGS IN WHICH KATY WAS DEPICTED AS PRONE IN HER BERTH REFUSING WITH HORROR TO GO TO DINNER
4138-11079-0026 LOOKING LONGINGLY BACKWARD TOWARD THE QUARTER WHERE THE UNITED STATES WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AND FISHING OUT OF HER PORT HOLE WITH A CROOKED PIN IN HOPES OF GRAPPLING THE SUBMARINE CABLE AND SENDING A MESSAGE TO HER FAMILY TO COME OUT AT ONCE AND TAKE HER HOME
4138-11079-0027 IT ENDED WITH THIS SHORT POEM OVER WHICH KATY LAUGHED TILL MISSUS ASHE CALLED FEEBLY ACROSS THE ENTRY TO ASK WHAT WAS THE MATTER BREAK BREAK BREAK AND MIS BEHAVE O SEA AND I WISH THAT MY TONGUE COULD UTTER THE HATRED I FEEL FOR THEE
4138-11079-0028 OH WELL FOR THE FISHERMAN'S CHILD ON THE SANDY BEACH AT HIS PLAY
4138-11079-0029 BUT THIS HORRIBLE SHIP KEEPS ON AND IS NEVER A MOMENT STILL AND I YEARN FOR THE TOUCH OF THE NICE DRY LAND WHERE I NEEDN'T FEEL SO ILL BREAK BREAK BREAK THERE IS NO GOOD LEFT IN ME
4138-11079-0030 FOR THE DINNER I ATE ON THE SHORE SO LATE HAS VANISHED INTO THE SEA LAUGHTER IS VERY RESTORATIVE AFTER THE FORLORNITY OF SEA SICKNESS AND KATY WAS SO STIMULATED BY HER LETTER THAT SHE MANAGED TO STRUGGLE INTO HER DRESSING GOWN AND SLIPPERS
4138-11079-0031 AMY HAD FALLEN ASLEEP AT LAST AND MUST NOT BE WAKED UP SO THEIR INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED IN WHISPERS MISSUS ASHE HAD BY NO MEANS GOT TO THE TEA AND TOAST STAGE YET AND WAS FEELING MISERABLE ENOUGH
4138-11079-0032 ALL DAY YESTERDAY WHEN SHE WASN'T SICK
4138-11079-0033 I NEVER KNEW HER SO NAUGHTY AND IT SEEMED VERY NEGLECTFUL NOT TO COME TO SEE AFTER YOU POOR DEAR CHILD BUT REALLY I COULDN'T RAISE MY HEAD NEITHER COULD I AND I FELT JUST AS GUILTY NOT TO BE TAKING CARE OF YOU SAID KATY WELL
4138-11079-0034 THE WORST IS OVER WITH ALL OF US I HOPE THE VESSEL DOESN'T PITCH HALF SO MUCH NOW AND THE STEWARDESS SAYS WE SHALL FEEL A GREAT DEAL BETTER AS SOON AS WE GET ON DECK SHE IS COMING PRESENTLY TO HELP ME UP AND WHEN AMY WAKES WON'T YOU LET HER BE DRESSED
4138-11079-0035 AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF HER WHILE MISSUS BARRETT ATTENDS TO YOU I DON'T THINK I CAN BE DRESSED SIGHED POOR MISSUS ASHE
4138-11079-0036 AND SEATED HER ON DECK IN A CHAIR WITH A GREAT RUG WRAPPED ABOUT HER FEET WITH VERY LITTLE EFFORT ON KATY'S PART THEN SHE DIVED DOWN THE COMPANION WAY AGAIN AND IN THE COURSE OF AN HOUR APPEARED ESCORTING A BIG BURLY STEWARD
4138-11079-0037 WHO CARRIED POOR LITTLE PALE AMY IN HIS ARMS AS EASILY AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN A KITTEN AMY GAVE A SCREAM OF JOY AT THE SIGHT OF KATY AND CUDDLED DOWN IN HER LAP UNDER THE WARM RUG WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF AND SATISFACTION
4138-11079-0038 I THOUGHT I WAS NEVER GOING TO SEE YOU AGAIN SHE SAID WITH A LITTLE SQUEEZE OH MISS KATY IT HAS BEEN SO HORRID I NEVER THOUGHT THAT GOING TO EUROPE MEANT SUCH DREADFUL THINGS AS THIS THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
4138-11079-0039 SHE COULDN'T ANSWER SHE WAS TOO ILL EXPLAINED KATY WELL MY PET IT WAS PRETTY HARD FOR YOU I HOPE WE SHA'N'T HAVE ANY MORE SUCH DAYS THE SEA IS A GREAT DEAL SMOOTHER NOW MABEL LOOKS QUITE PALE
4138-11079-0040 SHE WAS SICK TOO SAID AMY REGARDING THE DOLL IN HER ARMS WITH AN ANXIOUS AIR
4138-11079-0041 ONLY I KEEP THINKING OF POOR LITTLE MARIA MATILDA SHUT UP IN THE TRUNK IN THAT DARK PLACE AND WONDERING IF SHE'S SICK THERE'S NOBODY TO EXPLAIN TO HER DOWN THERE THEY SAY THAT YOU DON'T FEEL THE MOTION HALF SO MUCH IN THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIP SAID KATY
4138-11079-0042 PERHAPS SHE HASN'T NOTICED IT AT ALL DEAR ME HOW GOOD SOMETHING SMELLS I WISH THEY WOULD BRING US SOMETHING TO EAT A GOOD MANY PASSENGERS HAD COME UP BY THIS TIME AND ROBERT THE DECK STEWARD WAS GOING ABOUT TRAY IN HAND TAKING ORDERS FOR LUNCH
4138-11079-0043 AMY AND KATY BOTH FELT SUDDENLY RAVENOUS AND WHEN MISSUS ASHE AWHILE LATER WAS HELPED UP THE STAIRS SHE WAS AMAZED TO FIND THEM EATING COLD BEEF AND ROASTED POTATOES WITH THE FINEST APPETITES IN THE WORLD
4138-11079-0044 SO IT PROVED FOR AFTER THESE TWO BAD DAYS NONE OF THE PARTY WERE SICK AGAIN DURING THE VOYAGE AMY HAD A CLAMOROUS APPETITE FOR STORIES AS WELL AS FOR COLD BEEF AND TO APPEASE THIS CRAVING KATY STARTED A SORT OF OCEAN SERIAL CALLED
4138-11079-0045 THE HISTORY OF VIOLET AND EMMA
4138-11079-0046 BUT WHICH IN REALITY LASTED MUCH LONGER IT MIGHT WITH EQUAL PROPRIETY HAVE BEEN CALLED THE ADVENTURES OF TWO LITTLE GIRLS WHO DIDN'T HAVE ANY ADVENTURES FOR NOTHING IN PARTICULAR HAPPENED TO EITHER VIOLET OR EMMA DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF THEIR LONG DRAWN OUT HISTORY
4138-11079-0047 AMY HOWEVER FOUND THEM PERFECTLY ENCHANTING AND WAS NEVER WEARY OF HEARING HOW THEY WENT TO SCHOOL AND CAME HOME AGAIN HOW THEY GOT INTO SCRAPES AND GOT OUT OF THEM HOW THEY MADE GOOD RESOLUTIONS AND BROKE THEM ABOUT THEIR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS AND BIRTHDAY TREATS
4138-11079-0048 AND WHAT THEY SAID AND HOW THEY FELT THE FIRST INSTALMENT OF THIS UN EXCITING ROMANCE WAS GIVEN THAT FIRST AFTERNOON ON DECK AND AFTER THAT AMY CLAIMED A NEW CHAPTER DAILY AND IT WAS A CHIEF INGREDIENT OF HER PLEASURE DURING THE VOYAGE
4138-11079-0049 ON THE THIRD MORNING KATY WOKE AND DRESSED SO EARLY THAT SHE GAINED THE DECK BEFORE THE SAILORS HAD FINISHED THEIR SCRUBBING AND HOLYSTONING SHE TOOK REFUGE WITHIN THE COMPANION WAY AND SAT DOWN ON THE TOP STEP OF THE LADDER TO WAIT TILL THE DECK WAS DRY ENOUGH TO VENTURE UPON IT
4138-11079-0050 THERE THE CAPTAIN FOUND HER AND DREW NEAR FOR A TALK CAPTAIN BRYCE WAS EXACTLY THE KIND OF SEA CAPTAIN THAT IS FOUND IN STORY BOOKS BUT NOT ALWAYS IN REAL LIFE HE WAS STOUT AND GRIZZLED AND BROWN AND KIND
4138-11079-0051 HE HAD A BLUFF WEATHER BEATEN FACE LIT UP WITH A PAIR OF SHREWD BLUE EYES WHICH TWINKLED WHEN HE WAS PLEASED AND HIS MANNER THOUGH IT WAS FULL OF THE HABIT OF COMMAND WAS QUIET AND PLEASANT HE WAS A MARTINET ON BOARD HIS SHIP
4138-11079-0052 NOT A SAILOR UNDER HIM WOULD HAVE DARED DISPUTE HIS ORDERS FOR A MOMENT BUT HE WAS VERY POPULAR WITH THEM NOTWITHSTANDING THEY LIKED HIM AS MUCH AS THEY FEARED HIM FOR THEY KNEW HIM TO BE THEIR BEST FRIEND IF IT CAME TO SICKNESS OR TROUBLE WITH ANY OF THEM
4138-11079-0053 KATY AND HE GREW QUITE INTIMATE DURING THEIR LONG MORNING TALK THE CAPTAIN LIKED GIRLS HE HAD ONE OF HIS OWN ABOUT KATY'S AGE AND WAS FOND OF TALKING ABOUT HER LUCY WAS HIS MAINSTAY AT HOME HE TOLD KATY
4138-11079-0054 HER MOTHER HAD BEEN WEAKLY NOW THIS LONG TIME BACK AND BESS AND NANNY WERE BUT CHILDREN YET SO LUCY HAD TO TAKE COMMAND AND KEEP THINGS SHIP SHAPE WHEN HE WAS AWAY SHE'LL BE ON THE LOOKOUT WHEN THE STEAMER COMES IN SAID THE CAPTAIN
4138-11079-0055 THERE'S A SIGNAL WE'VE ARRANGED WHICH MEANS ALL'S WELL AND WHEN WE GET UP THE RIVER A LITTLE WAY I ALWAYS LOOK TO SEE IF IT'S FLYING IT'S A BIT OF A TOWEL HUNG FROM A PARTICULAR WINDOW AND WHEN I SEE IT I SAY TO MYSELF THANK GOD ANOTHER VOYAGE SAFELY DONE AND NO HARM COME OF IT
4138-11079-0056 IT'S A SAD KIND OF WORK FOR A MAN TO GO OFF FOR A TWENTY FOUR DAYS CRUISE LEAVING A SICK WIFE ON SHORE BEHIND HIM IF IT WASN'T THAT I HAVE LUCY TO LOOK AFTER THINGS I SHOULD HAVE THROWN UP MY COMMAND LONG AGO INDEED I AM GLAD YOU HAVE LUCY
4138-11079-0057 SHE MUST BE A GREAT COMFORT TO YOU SAID KATY SYMPATHETICALLY FOR THE CAPTAIN'S HEARTY VOICE TREMBLED A LITTLE AS HE SPOKE SHE MADE HIM TELL HER THE COLOR OF LUCY'S HAIR AND EYES AND EXACTLY HOW TALL SHE WAS AND WHAT SHE HAD STUDIED AND WHAT SORT OF BOOKS SHE LIKED
4138-11079-0058 IT CONTAINED A PRETTY LITTLE GREEN BOUND COPY OF EMERSON'S POEMS WITH KATY'S NAME AND TO BE READ AT SEA WRITTEN ON THE FLYLEAF SOMEHOW THE LITTLE GIFT SEEMED TO BRIDGE THE LONG MISTY DISTANCE WHICH STRETCHED BETWEEN THE VESSEL'S STERN AND BOSTON BAY
4138-11079-0059 AND TO BRING HOME AND FRIENDS A GREAT DEAL NEARER WITH A HALF HAPPY HALF TEARFUL PLEASURE KATY RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT DISTANCE COUNTS FOR LITTLE IF PEOPLE LOVE ONE ANOTHER
4138-11079-0060 AND THAT HEARTS HAVE A TELEGRAPH OF THEIR OWN WHOSE MESSAGES ARE AS SURE AND SWIFT AS ANY OF THOSE SENT OVER THE MATERIAL LINES WHICH LINK CONTINENT TO CONTINENT AND SHORE WITH SHORE LATER IN THE MORNING
4138-11079-0061 KATY GOING DOWN TO HER STATEROOM FOR SOMETHING CAME ACROSS A PALLID EXHAUSTED LOOKING LADY WHO LAY STRETCHED ON ONE OF THE LONG SOFAS IN THE CABIN WITH A BABY IN HER ARMS AND A LITTLE GIRL SITTING AT HER FEET QUITE STILL WITH A PAIR OF SMALL HANDS FOLDED IN HER LAP
4138-11079-0062 THE LITTLE GIRL DID NOT SEEM TO BE MORE THAN FOUR YEARS OLD SHE HAD TWO PIG TAILS OF THICK FLAXEN HAIR HANGING OVER HER SHOULDERS AND AT KATY'S APPROACH RAISED A PAIR OF SOLEMN BLUE EYES WHICH HAD SO MUCH APPEAL IN THEM THOUGH SHE SAID NOTHING
4138-11079-0063 THAT KATY STOPPED AT ONCE CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU SHE ASKED I AM AFRAID YOU HAVE BEEN VERY ILL AT THE SOUND OF HER VOICE THE LADY ON THE SOFA OPENED HER EYES SHE TRIED TO SPEAK BUT TO KATY'S DISMAY BEGAN TO CRY INSTEAD
4138-11079-0064 AND WHEN THE WORDS CAME THEY WERE STRANGLED WITH SOBS
4138-11079-0065 IF YOU WOULD GIVE MY LITTLE GIRL SOMETHING TO EAT SHE HAS HAD NOTHING SINCE YESTERDAY AND I HAVE BEEN SO ILL AND NO
4138-11079-0066 OH CRIED KATY WITH HORROR NOTHING TO EAT SINCE YESTERDAY HOW DID IT HAPPEN EVERYBODY HAS BEEN SICK ON OUR SIDE THE SHIP EXPLAINED THE POOR LADY AND I SUPPOSE THE STEWARDESS THOUGHT AS I HAD A MAID WITH ME
4138-11079-0067 THAT I NEEDED HER LESS THAN THE OTHERS BUT MY MAID HAS BEEN SICK TOO AND OH SO SELFISH SHE WOULDN'T EVEN TAKE THE BABY INTO THE BERTH WITH HER AND I HAVE HAD ALL I COULD DO TO MANAGE WITH HIM WHEN I COULDN'T LIFT UP MY HEAD
4138-11079-0068 LITTLE GRETCHEN HAS HAD TO GO WITHOUT ANYTHING AND SHE HAS BEEN SO GOOD AND PATIENT KATY LOST NO TIME BUT RAN FOR MISSUS BARRETT WHOSE INDIGNATION KNEW NO BOUNDS WHEN SHE HEARD HOW THE HELPLESS PARTY HAD BEEN NEGLECTED
4138-11079-0069 ALL THE TIME THAT SHE TALKED MISSUS BARRETT WAS BUSY IN MAKING MISSUS WARE FOR THAT IT SEEMED WAS THE SICK LADY'S NAME MORE COMFORTABLE AND KATY WAS FEEDING GRETCHEN OUT OF A BIG BOWL FULL OF BREAD AND MILK WHICH ONE OF THE STEWARDS HAD BROUGHT
4138-11079-0070 THE LITTLE UNCOMPLAINING THING WAS EVIDENTLY HALF STARVED BUT WITH THE MOUTHFULS THE PINK BEGAN TO STEAL BACK INTO HER CHEEKS AND LIPS
4138-11079-0071 AND OTHERS NOT SO PLEASANT PERHAPS WHO WERE RATHER CURIOUS AND INTERESTING TO WATCH KATY GREW TO FEEL AS IF SHE KNEW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HER FELLOW TRAVELLERS AS TIME WENT ON THERE WAS THE YOUNG GIRL GOING OUT TO JOIN HER PARENTS UNDER THE CARE OF A SEVERE GOVERNESS
4138-11079-0072 WHOM EVERYBODY ON BOARD RATHER PITIED THERE WAS THE OTHER GIRL ON HER WAY TO STUDY ART WHO WAS TRAVELLING QUITE ALONE AND SEEMED TO HAVE NOBODY TO MEET HER OR TO GO TO EXCEPT A FELLOW STUDENT OF HER OWN AGE ALREADY IN PARIS BUT WHO SEEMED QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF HER LONELY POSITION
4138-11079-0073 AND COMPETENT TO GRAPPLE WITH ANYTHING OR ANYBODY THERE WAS THE QUEER OLD GENTLEMAN WHO HAD CROSSED ELEVEN TIMES BEFORE AND HAD ADVICE AND EXPERIENCE TO SPARE FOR ANY ONE WHO WOULD LISTEN TO THEM AND THE OTHER GENTLEMAN NOT SO OLD BUT EVEN MORE QUEER
4138-11079-0074 WHO HAD FROZEN HIS STOMACH EIGHT YEARS BEFORE BY INDULGING ON A HOT SUMMER'S DAY IN SIXTEEN SUCCESSIVE ICE CREAMS ALTERNATED WITH TEN GLASSES OF EQUALLY COLD SODA WATER AND WHO RELATED THIS EXCITING EXPERIENCE IN TURN TO EVERYBODY ON BOARD
4138-11079-0075 THERE WAS THE BAD LITTLE BOY WHOSE PARENTS WERE POWERLESS TO OPPOSE HIM AND WHO CARRIED TERROR TO THE HEARTS OF ALL BEHOLDERS WHENEVER HE APPEARED AND THE PRETTY WIDOW WHO FILLED THE ROLE OF REIGNING BELLE AND THE OTHER WIDOW NOT QUITE SO PRETTY OR SO MUCH A BELLE
4138-11079-0076 WHO HAD A GOOD DEAL TO SAY IN A VOICE MADE DISCREETLY LOW ABOUT WHAT A PITY IT WAS THAT DEAR MISSUS SO AND SO SHOULD DO THIS OR THAT AND DOESN'T IT STRIKE YOU AS VERY UNFORTUNATE THAT SHE SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE OTHER THING
4138-11079-0077 A GREAT SEA GOING STEAMER IS A LITTLE WORLD IN ITSELF AND GIVES ONE A GLIMPSE OF ALL SORTS AND CONDITIONS OF PEOPLE AND CHARACTERS ON THE WHOLE THERE WAS NO ONE ON THE SPARTACUS WHOM KATY LIKED SO WELL AS SEDATE LITTLE GRETCHEN EXCEPT THE DEAR OLD CAPTAIN
4138-11079-0078 WITH WHOM SHE WAS A PRIME FAVORITE HE GAVE MISSUS ASHE AND HERSELF THE SEATS NEXT TO HIM AT TABLE LOOKED AFTER THEIR COMFORT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY AND EACH NIGHT AT DINNER SENT KATY ONE OF THE APPLE DUMPLINGS MADE SPECIALLY FOR HIM BY THE COOK
4138-11079-0079 WHO HAD GONE MANY VOYAGES WITH THE CAPTAIN AND KNEW HIS FANCIES KATY DID NOT CARE PARTICULARLY FOR THE DUMPLING BUT SHE VALUED IT AS A MARK OF REGARD AND ALWAYS ATE IT WHEN SHE COULD
4138-11079-0080 MEANWHILE EVERY MORNING BROUGHT A FRESH SURPRISE FROM THAT DEAR PAINSTAKING ROSE WHO HAD EVIDENTLY WORKED HARD AND THOUGHT HARDER IN CONTRIVING PLEASURES FOR KATY'S FIRST VOYAGE AT SEA MISSUS BARRETT WAS ENLISTED IN THE PLOT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OF THAT
4138-11079-0081 AND ENJOYED THE JOKE AS MUCH AS ANY ONE AS SHE PRESENTED HERSELF EACH DAY WITH THE INVARIABLE FORMULA A LETTER FOR YOU MA'AM OR A BUNDLE MISS COME BY THE PARCELS DELIVERY ON THE FOURTH MORNING IT WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF BABY ROSE IN A LITTLE FLAT MOROCCO CASE
4138-11079-0082 THE FIFTH BROUGHT A WONDERFUL EPISTLE FULL OF STARTLING PIECES OF NEWS NONE OF THEM TRUE ON THE SIXTH APPEARED A LONG NARROW BOX CONTAINING A FOUNTAIN PEN THEN CAME MISTER HOWELLS'S A FOREGONE CONCLUSION WHICH KATY HAD NEVER SEEN
4138-11079-0083 THEN A BOX OF QUININE PILLS THEN A SACHET FOR HER TRUNK THEN ANOTHER BURLESQUE POEM LAST OF ALL A CAKE OF DELICIOUS VIOLET SOAP TO WASH THE SEA SMELL FROM HER HANDS THE LABEL SAID
4138-11079-0084 IT GREW TO BE ONE OF THE LITTLE EXCITEMENTS OF SHIP LIFE TO WATCH FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THESE DAILY GIFTS AND WHAT DID THE MAIL BRING FOR YOU THIS TIME MISS CARR WAS A QUESTION FREQUENTLY ASKED EACH ARRIVAL KATY THOUGHT MUST BE THE FINAL ONE
4138-11079-0085 BUT ROSE'S FORETHOUGHT HAD GONE SO FAR EVEN AS TO PROVIDE AN EXTRA PARCEL IN CASE THE VOYAGE WAS A DAY LONGER THAN USUAL AND MISS CARR'S MAIL CONTINUED TO COME IN TILL THE VERY LAST MORNING KATY NEVER FORGOT THE THRILL THAT WENT THROUGH HER WHEN AFTER SO MANY DAYS OF SEA
4138-11079-0086 HER EYES FIRST CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE DIM LINE OF THE IRISH COAST AN EXCITING AND INTERESTING DAY FOLLOWED AS AFTER STOPPING AT QUEENSTOWN TO LEAVE THE MAILS THEY SPED NORTHEASTWARD BETWEEN SHORES WHICH GREW MORE DISTINCT AND BEAUTIFUL WITH EVERY HOUR
4138-11079-0087 ON ONE SIDE IRELAND ON THE OTHER THE BOLD MOUNTAIN LINES OF THE WELSH COAST IT WAS LATE AFTERNOON WHEN THEY ENTERED THE MERSEY AND DUSK HAD FALLEN BEFORE THE CAPTAIN GOT OUT HIS GLASS TO LOOK FOR THE WHITE FLUTTERING SPECK IN HIS OWN WINDOW WHICH MEANT SO MUCH TO HIM
4138-11079-0088 LONG HE STUDIED BEFORE HE MADE QUITE SURE THAT IT WAS THERE AT LAST HE SHUT THE GLASS WITH A SATISFIED AIR IT'S ALL RIGHT HE SAID TO KATY WHO STOOD NEAR ALMOST AS MUCH INTERESTED AS HE LUCY NEVER FORGETS BLESS HER
4138-11079-0089 WELL THERE'S ANOTHER VOYAGE OVER AND DONE WITH THANK GOD AND MY MARY IS WHERE SHE WAS IT'S A LOAD TAKEN FROM MY MIND THE MOON HAD RISEN AND WAS SHINING SOFTLY ON THE RIVER AS THE CROWDED TENDER LANDED THE PASSENGERS FROM THE SPARTACUS
4138-11079-0090 AT THE LIVERPOOL DOCKS WE SHALL MEET AGAIN IN LONDON OR IN PARIS SAID ONE TO ANOTHER AND CARDS AND ADDRESSES WERE EXCHANGED THEN AFTER A BRIEF DELAY AT THE CUSTOM HOUSE THEY SEPARATED EACH TO HIS OWN PARTICULAR DESTINATION
4138-11079-0091 AND AS A GENERAL THING NONE OF THEM EVER SAW ANY OF THE OTHERS AGAIN IT IS OFTEN THUS WITH THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN FELLOW VOYAGERS AT SEA AND IT IS ALWAYS A SURPRISE AND PERPLEXITY TO INEXPERIENCED TRAVELLERS THAT IT CAN BE SO
4138-11079-0092 AND THAT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SO MUCH TO EACH OTHER FOR TEN DAYS CAN MELT AWAY INTO SPACE AND DISAPPEAR AS THOUGH THE BRIEF INTIMACY HAD NEVER EXISTED FOUR WHEELER OR HANSOM MA'AM SAID A PORTER TO MISSUS ASHE WHICH KATY OH
4138-11079-0093 LET US HAVE A HANSOM I NEVER SAW ONE AND THEY LOOK SO NICE IN PUNCH SO A HANSOM CAB WAS CALLED THE TWO LADIES GOT IN AMY CUDDLED DOWN BETWEEN THEM THE FOLDING DOORS WERE SHUT OVER THEIR KNEES LIKE A LAP ROBE
4138-11079-0094 AND AWAY THEY DROVE UP THE SOLIDLY PAVED STREETS TO THE HOTEL WHERE THEY WERE TO PASS THE NIGHT IT WAS TOO LATE TO SEE OR DO ANYTHING BUT ENJOY THE SENSE OF BEING ON FIRM LAND ONCE MORE HOW LOVELY IT WILL BE TO SLEEP IN A BED THAT DOESN'T TIP OR ROLL FROM SIDE TO SIDE SAID MISSUS ASHE
4138-11079-0095 YES AND THAT IS WIDE ENOUGH AND LONG ENOUGH AND SOFT ENOUGH TO BE COMFORTABLE REPLIED KATY I FEEL AS IF I COULD SLEEP FOR A FORTNIGHT TO MAKE UP FOR THE BAD NIGHTS AT SEA EVERYTHING SEEMED DELIGHTFUL TO HER THE SPACE FOR UNDRESSING
4138-11079-0096 THE GREAT TUB OF FRESH WATER WHICH STOOD BESIDE THE ENGLISH LOOKING WASHSTAND WITH ITS AMPLE BASIN AND EWER THE CHINTZ CURTAINED BED THE COOLNESS THE SILENCE AND SHE CLOSED HER EYES WITH THE PLEASANT THOUGHT IN HER MIND
