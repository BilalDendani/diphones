4005-7262-0000 TILL THE LAST WORDS SOUNDED FAINT BUT CLEAR AS IF SHOUTED ON A CALM DAY FROM A VERY GREAT DISTANCE HE MOVED NOT HE STARED FIXEDLY PAST THE MOTIONLESS HEAD OF HOLLIS WHO FACED HIM
4005-7262-0001 AS STILL AS HIMSELF JACKSON HAD TURNED SIDEWAYS AND WITH ELBOW ON THE TABLE SHADED HIS EYES WITH THE PALM OF HIS HAND AND I LOOKED ON SURPRISED AND MOVED I LOOKED AT THAT MAN
4005-7262-0002 LOYAL TO A VISION BETRAYED BY HIS DREAM SPURNED BY HIS ILLUSION AND COMING TO US UNBELIEVERS FOR HELP AGAINST A THOUGHT THE SILENCE WAS PROFOUND BUT IT SEEMED FULL OF NOISELESS PHANTOMS
4005-7262-0003 OF THINGS SORROWFUL SHADOWY AND MUTE IN WHOSE INVISIBLE PRESENCE THE FIRM PULSATING BEAT OF THE TWO SHIP'S CHRONOMETERS TICKING OFF STEADILY THE SECONDS OF GREENWICH TIME SEEMED TO ME A PROTECTION
4005-7262-0004 AND A RELIEF KARAIN STARED STONILY AND LOOKING AT HIS RIGID FIGURE I THOUGHT OF HIS WANDERINGS OF THAT OBSCURE ODYSSEY OF REVENGE OF ALL THE MEN THAT WANDER
4005-7262-0005 AMONGST ILLUSIONS FAITHFUL FAITHLESS OF THE ILLUSIONS THAT GIVE JOY THAT GIVE SORROW THAT GIVE PAIN THAT GIVE PEACE OF THE INVINCIBLE ILLUSIONS THAT CAN MAKE LIFE AND DEATH APPEAR SERENE INSPIRING
4005-7262-0006 TORMENTED OR IGNOBLE A MURMUR WAS HEARD THAT VOICE FROM OUTSIDE SEEMED TO FLOW OUT OF A DREAMING WORLD INTO THE LAMP LIGHT OF THE CABIN KARAIN WAS SPEAKING
4005-7262-0007 I LIVED IN THE FOREST SHE CAME NO MORE NEVER NEVER ONCE I LIVED ALONE SHE HAD FORGOTTEN IT WAS WELL I DID NOT WANT HER
4005-7262-0008 I WANTED NO ONE I FOUND AN ABANDONED HOUSE IN AN OLD CLEARING NOBODY CAME NEAR SOMETIMES I HEARD IN THE DISTANCE THE VOICES OF PEOPLE GOING ALONG A PATH I SLEPT I RESTED THERE WAS WILD RICE
4005-7262-0009 WATER FROM A RUNNING STREAM AND PEACE EVERY NIGHT I SAT ALONE BY MY SMALL FIRE BEFORE THE HUT MANY NIGHTS PASSED OVER MY HEAD THEN ONE EVENING AS I SAT BY MY FIRE AFTER HAVING EATEN
4005-7262-0010 I LOOKED DOWN ON THE GROUND AND BEGAN TO REMEMBER MY WANDERINGS I LIFTED MY HEAD I HAD HEARD NO SOUND NO RUSTLE NO FOOTSTEPS BUT I LIFTED MY HEAD
4005-7262-0011 A MAN WAS COMING TOWARDS ME ACROSS THE SMALL CLEARING I WAITED HE CAME UP WITHOUT A GREETING AND SQUATTED DOWN INTO THE FIRELIGHT THEN HE TURNED HIS FACE TO ME IT WAS MATARA
4005-7262-0012 HE STARED AT ME FIERCELY WITH HIS BIG SUNKEN EYES THE NIGHT WAS COLD THE HEAT DIED SUDDENLY OUT OF THE FIRE AND HE STARED AT ME I ROSE AND WENT AWAY FROM THERE LEAVING HIM BY THE FIRE THAT HAD NO HEAT
4005-7262-0013 I HEARD HIM IN THE BUSHES HERE AND THERE WHISPERING WHISPERING I UNDERSTOOD AT LAST I HAD HEARD THE WORDS BEFORE YOU ARE MY FRIEND KILL WITH A SURE SHOT
4005-7262-0014 I BORE IT AS LONG AS I COULD THEN LEAPED AWAY AS ON THIS VERY NIGHT I LEAPED FROM MY STOCKADE AND SWAM TO YOU I RAN I RAN CRYING LIKE A CHILD LEFT ALONE AND FAR FROM THE HOUSES HE RAN BY MY SIDE WITHOUT FOOTSTEPS
4005-7262-0015 WHISPERING WHISPERING INVISIBLE AND HEARD I SOUGHT PEOPLE I WANTED MEN AROUND ME MEN WHO HAD NOT DIED AND AGAIN WE TWO WANDERED I SOUGHT DANGER VIOLENCE AND DEATH
4005-7262-0016 AND A BRAVE PEOPLE WONDERED AT THE VALIANCE OF A STRANGER BUT WE WERE TWO HE WARDED OFF THE BLOWS WHY I WANTED PEACE NOT LIFE AND NO ONE COULD SEE HIM NO ONE KNEW
4005-7262-0017 I MET AN OLD MAN YOU ALL KNEW HIM PEOPLE HERE CALLED HIM MY SORCERER MY SERVANT AND SWORD BEARER BUT TO ME HE WAS FATHER MOTHER PROTECTION REFUGE AND PEACE
4005-7262-0018 WHEN I MET HIM HE WAS RETURNING FROM A PILGRIMAGE AND I HEARD HIM INTONING THE PRAYER OF SUNSET HE HAD GONE TO THE HOLY PLACE WITH HIS SON HIS SON'S WIFE AND A LITTLE CHILD
4005-7262-0019 AND ON THEIR RETURN BY THE FAVOUR OF THE MOST HIGH THEY ALL DIED THE STRONG MAN THE YOUNG MOTHER THE LITTLE CHILD THEY DIED AND THE OLD MAN REACHED HIS COUNTRY ALONE
4005-7262-0020 HE SAID OVER ME WORDS OF COMPASSION OF WISDOM OF PRAYER HE WARDED FROM ME THE SHADE OF THE DEAD
4005-7262-0021 FOR A LONG TIME HE REFUSED BUT AT LAST WITH A SIGH AND A SMILE HE GAVE ME ONE DOUBTLESS HE COULD COMMAND A SPIRIT STRONGER THAN THE UNREST OF MY DEAD FRIEND AND AGAIN I HAD PEACE
4005-7262-0022 BUT I HAD BECOME RESTLESS AND A LOVER OF TURMOIL AND DANGER THE OLD MAN NEVER LEFT ME WE TRAVELLED TOGETHER WE WERE WELCOMED BY THE GREAT HIS WISDOM AND MY COURAGE ARE REMEMBERED
4005-7262-0023 WHERE YOUR STRENGTH O WHITE MEN IS FORGOTTEN WE SERVED THE SULTAN OF SULA WE FOUGHT THE SPANIARDS THERE WERE VICTORIES HOPES DEFEATS SORROW BLOOD WOMEN'S TEARS WHAT FOR WE FLED
4005-7262-0024 AND I AM AGAIN THE SLAVE OF THE DEAD HE IS NOT HERE NOW TO DRIVE AWAY THE REPROACHFUL SHADE TO SILENCE THE LIFELESS VOICE THE POWER OF HIS CHARM HAS DIED WITH HIM AND I KNOW FEAR AND I HEAR THE WHISPER KILL
4005-7262-0025 KILL KILL HAVE I NOT KILLED ENOUGH FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT NIGHT A SUDDEN CONVULSION OF MADNESS AND RAGE PASSED OVER HIS FACE HIS WAVERING GLANCES DARTED HERE AND THERE LIKE SCARED BIRDS IN A THUNDERSTORM
4005-7262-0026 I SWEAR SOME DAY I WILL STRIKE INTO EVERY HEART I MEET I HE LOOKED SO DANGEROUS THAT WE ALL THREE LEAPED TO OUR FEET AND HOLLIS WITH THE BACK OF HIS HAND
4005-7262-0027 AND HOLDING HIS CHIN IN HIS HAND SCRUTINIZED HIM IN PENSIVE SILENCE I SAID YOU MUST ABIDE WITH YOUR PEOPLE THEY NEED YOU AND THERE IS FORGETFULNESS IN LIFE EVEN THE DEAD CEASE TO SPEAK IN TIME
4005-7262-0028 TO FORGET LONG YEARS BEFORE AN EYELID HAS HAD THE TIME TO BEAT TWICE HE EXCLAIMED WITH BITTER RESENTMENT HE STARTLED ME IT WAS AMAZING TO HIM HIS LIFE THAT CRUEL MIRAGE OF LOVE AND PEACE
4005-7262-0029 SEEMED AS REAL AS UNDENIABLE AS THEIRS WOULD BE TO ANY SAINT PHILOSOPHER OR FOOL OF US ALL HOLLIS MUTTERED YOU WON'T SOOTHE HIM WITH YOUR PLATITUDES KARAIN SPOKE TO ME
4005-7262-0030 YOU KNOW US YOU HAVE LIVED WITH US WHY WE CANNOT KNOW BUT YOU UNDERSTAND OUR SORROWS AND OUR THOUGHTS YOU HAVE LIVED WITH MY PEOPLE AND YOU UNDERSTAND OUR DESIRES AND OUR FEARS
4005-7262-0031 WITH YOU I WILL GO TO YOUR LAND TO YOUR PEOPLE TO YOUR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN UNBELIEF TO WHOM DAY IS DAY AND NIGHT IS NIGHT NOTHING MORE
4005-7262-0032 MURMURED HOLLIS WITH THE FLICKER OF A SMILE KARAIN HUNG HIS HEAD I CAN TOIL AND FIGHT AND BE FAITHFUL HE WHISPERED IN A WEARY TONE BUT I CANNOT GO BACK TO HIM WHO WAITS FOR ME ON THE SHORE
4005-7262-0033 AS IF DEBATING WITH HIMSELF THAT WOULD BE ONE WAY THE GHOSTS THERE ARE IN SOCIETY AND TALK AFFABLY TO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BUT WOULD SCORN A NAKED HUMAN BEING LIKE OUR PRINCELY FRIEND NAKED
4005-7262-0034 FLAYED I SHOULD SAY I AM SORRY FOR HIM IMPOSSIBLE OF COURSE THE END OF ALL THIS SHALL BE HE WENT ON LOOKING UP AT US THE END OF THIS SHALL BE THAT SOME DAY HE WILL RUN AMUCK AMONGST HIS FAITHFUL SUBJECTS
4005-7262-0035 BEFORE THEY MAKE UP THEIR MINDS TO THE DISLOYALTY OF KNOCKING HIM ON THE HEAD I NODDED I THOUGHT IT MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT SUCH WOULD BE THE END OF KARAIN
4005-7262-0036 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HAD BEEN HUNTED BY HIS THOUGHT ALONG THE VERY LIMIT OF HUMAN ENDURANCE AND VERY LITTLE MORE PRESSING WAS NEEDED TO MAKE HIM SWERVE OVER INTO THE FORM OF MADNESS PECULIAR TO HIS RACE
4005-7262-0037 THAT MUCH WAS CLEAR HE LIFTED HIS HEAD SUDDENLY WE HAD IMAGINED FOR A MOMENT THAT HE HAD BEEN DOZING GIVE ME YOUR PROTECTION OR YOUR STRENGTH HE CRIED A CHARM A WEAPON
4005-7262-0038 AGAIN HIS CHIN FELL ON HIS BREAST WE LOOKED AT HIM THEN LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER WITH SUSPICIOUS AWE IN OUR EYES LIKE MEN WHO COME UNEXPECTEDLY
4005-7262-0039 HE HAD GIVEN HIMSELF UP TO US HE HAD THRUST INTO OUR HANDS HIS ERRORS AND HIS TORMENT HIS LIFE AND HIS PEACE AND WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT PROBLEM FROM THE OUTER DARKNESS
4005-7262-0040 LOOKING AT THE MALAY COULD NOT FIND ONE WORD TO THE PURPOSE AMONGST US IF INDEED THERE EXISTED A WORD THAT COULD SOLVE THAT PROBLEM WE PONDERED AND OUR HEARTS SANK
4005-7262-0041 WE FELT AS THOUGH WE THREE HAD BEEN CALLED TO THE VERY GATE OF INFERNAL REGIONS TO JUDGE TO DECIDE THE FATE OF A WANDERER COMING SUDDENLY FROM A WORLD OF SUNSHINE AND ILLUSIONS BY JOVE HE SEEMS TO HAVE A GREAT IDEA OF OUR POWER
4005-7262-0042 WHISPERED HOLLIS HOPELESSLY AND THEN AGAIN THERE WAS A SILENCE THE FEEBLE PLASH OF WATER THE STEADY TICK OF CHRONOMETERS JACKSON WITH BARE ARMS CROSSED LEANED HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE BULKHEAD OF THE CABIN
4005-7262-0043 HE WAS BENDING HIS HEAD UNDER THE DECK BEAM HIS FAIR BEARD SPREAD OUT MAGNIFICENTLY OVER HIS CHEST HE LOOKED COLOSSAL INEFFECTUAL AND MILD
4005-7262-0044 THE AIR IN IT SEEMED TO BECOME SLOWLY CHARGED WITH THE CRUEL CHILL OF HELPLESSNESS WITH THE PITILESS ANGER OF EGOISM AGAINST THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE FORM OF AN INTRUDING PAIN WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO
4005-7262-0045 WE BEGAN TO RESENT BITTERLY THE HARD NECESSITY TO GET RID OF HIM HOLLIS MUSED MUTTERED SUDDENLY WITH A SHORT LAUGH STRENGTH PROTECTION CHARM
4005-7262-0046 THEN HOLLIS REAPPEARED HOLDING IN BOTH HANDS A SMALL LEATHER BOX HE PUT IT DOWN GENTLY ON THE TABLE AND LOOKED AT US WITH A QUEER GASP WE THOUGHT AS THOUGH HE HAD FROM SOME CAUSE BECOME SPEECHLESS FOR A MOMENT
4005-7262-0047 OR WERE ETHICALLY UNCERTAIN ABOUT PRODUCING THAT BOX BUT IN AN INSTANT THE INSOLENT AND UNERRING WISDOM OF HIS YOUTH GAVE HIM THE NEEDED COURAGE HE SAID AS HE UNLOCKED THE BOX WITH A VERY SMALL KEY
4005-7262-0048 LOOK AS SOLEMN AS YOU CAN YOU FELLOWS PROBABLY WE LOOKED ONLY SURPRISED AND STUPID FOR HE GLANCED OVER HIS SHOULDER AND SAID ANGRILY THIS IS NO PLAY
4005-7262-0049 LOOK SERIOUS CONFOUND IT CAN'T YOU LIE A LITTLE FOR A FRIEND KARAIN SEEMED TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF US BUT WHEN HOLLIS THREW OPEN THE LID OF THE BOX HIS EYES FLEW TO IT
4005-7262-0050 AND SO DID OURS THE QUILTED CRIMSON SATIN OF THE INSIDE
4005-7262-0051 IT WAS SOMETHING POSITIVE TO LOOK AT
