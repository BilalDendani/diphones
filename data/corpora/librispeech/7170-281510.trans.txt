7170-281510-0000 A PALACE AND A PRISON ON EACH HAND I SAW FROM OUT THE WAVE HER STRUCTURES RISE AS FROM THE STROKE OF THE ENCHANTER'S WAND A THOUSAND YEARS THEIR CLOUDY WINGS EXPAND
7170-281510-0001 AROUND ME AND A DYING GLORY SMILES O'ER THE FAR TIMES WHEN MANY A SUBJECT LAND LOOKED TO THE WINGED LION'S MARBLE PILES WHERE VENICE SATE IN STATE
7170-281510-0002 RISING WITH HER TIARA OF PROUD TOWERS AT AIRY DISTANCE WITH MAJESTIC MOTION A RULER OF THE WATERS AND THEIR POWERS
7170-281510-0003 AND SUCH SHE WAS HER DAUGHTERS HAD THEIR DOWERS FROM SPOILS OF NATIONS AND THE EXHAUSTLESS EAST POURED IN HER LAP ALL GEMS IN SPARKLING SHOWERS IN PURPLE WAS SHE ROBED
7170-281510-0004 AND SILENT ROWS THE SONGLESS GONDOLIER HER PALACES ARE CRUMBLING TO THE SHORE AND MUSIC MEETS NOT ALWAYS NOW THE EAR THOSE DAYS ARE GONE BUT BEAUTY STILL IS HERE
7170-281510-0005 STATES FALL ARTS FADE
7170-281510-0006 NOR YET FORGET HOW VENICE ONCE WAS DEAR THE PLEASANT PLACE OF ALL FESTIVITY
7170-281510-0007 HER NAME IN STORY AND HER LONG ARRAY OF MIGHTY SHADOWS WHOSE DIM FORMS DESPOND ABOVE THE DOGELESS CITY'S VANISHED SWAY OURS IS A TROPHY WHICH WILL NOT DECAY WITH THE RIALTO
7170-281510-0008 ESSENTIALLY IMMORTAL THEY CREATE AND MULTIPLY IN US A BRIGHTER RAY AND MORE BELOVED EXISTENCE THAT WHICH FATE PROHIBITS TO DULL LIFE IN THIS OUR STATE
7170-281510-0009 OF MORTAL BONDAGE BY THESE SPIRITS SUPPLIED FIRST EXILES THEN REPLACES WHAT WE HATE WATERING THE HEART WHOSE EARLY FLOWERS HAVE DIED AND WITH A FRESHER GROWTH
7170-281510-0010 THE FIRST FROM HOPE THE LAST FROM VACANCY AND THIS WORN FEELING PEOPLES MANY A PAGE AND MAY BE THAT WHICH GROWS BENEATH MINE EYE YET THERE ARE THINGS WHOSE STRONG REALITY
7170-281510-0011 OUTSHINES OUR FAIRY LAND
7170-281510-0012 MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN OUR FANTASTIC SKY
7170-281510-0013 BUT LET THEM GO THEY CAME LIKE TRUTH AND DISAPPEARED LIKE DREAMS AND WHATSOE'ER THEY WERE ARE NOW BUT SO I COULD REPLACE THEM IF I WOULD STILL TEEMS MY MIND WITH MANY A FORM WHICH APTLY SEEMS
7170-281510-0014 SUCH AS I SOUGHT FOR AND AT MOMENTS FOUND LET THESE TOO GO FOR WAKING REASON DEEMS SUCH OVERWEENING PHANTASIES UNSOUND AND OTHER VOICES SPEAK
7170-281510-0015 TO THE MIND WHICH IS ITSELF NO CHANGES BRING SURPRISE NOR IS IT HARSH TO MAKE NOR HARD TO FIND A COUNTRY WITH AY OR WITHOUT MANKIND
7170-281510-0016 YET WAS I BORN WHERE MEN ARE PROUD TO BE NOT WITHOUT CAUSE AND SHOULD I LEAVE BEHIND THE INVIOLATE ISLAND OF THE SAGE AND FREE AND SEEK ME OUT A HOME
7170-281510-0017 AND SHOULD I LAY MY ASHES IN A SOIL WHICH IS NOT MINE MY SPIRIT SHALL RESUME IT IF WE MAY UNBODIED CHOOSE A SANCTUARY I TWINE MY HOPES OF BEING REMEMBERED IN MY LINE WITH MY LAND'S LANGUAGE
7170-281510-0018 IF TOO FOND AND FAR THESE ASPIRATIONS IN THEIR SCOPE INCLINE IF MY FAME SHOULD BE AS MY FORTUNES ARE OF HASTY GROWTH AND BLIGHT
7170-281510-0019 MY NAME FROM OUT THE TEMPLE WHERE THE DEAD ARE HONOURED BY THE NATIONS LET IT BE AND LIGHT THE LAURELS ON A LOFTIER HEAD AND BE THE SPARTAN'S EPITAPH ON ME
7170-281510-0020 SPARTA HATH MANY A WORTHIER SON THAN HE
7170-281510-0021 THE THORNS WHICH I HAVE REAPED ARE OF THE TREE I PLANTED THEY HAVE TORN ME AND I BLEED I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT FRUIT
7170-281510-0022 AND ANNUAL MARRIAGE NOW NO MORE RENEWED THE BUCENTAUR LIES ROTTING UNRESTORED NEGLECTED GARMENT OF HER WIDOWHOOD SAINT MARK YET SEES HIS LION WHERE HE STOOD
7170-281510-0023 STAND BUT IN MOCKERY OF HIS WITHERED POWER OVER THE PROUD PLACE WHERE AN EMPEROR SUED AND MONARCHS GAZED AND ENVIED IN THE HOUR WHEN VENICE WAS A QUEEN
7170-281510-0024 AN EMPEROR TRAMPLES WHERE AN EMPEROR KNELT KINGDOMS ARE SHRUNK TO PROVINCES AND CHAINS CLANK OVER SCEPTRED CITIES NATIONS MELT FROM POWER'S HIGH PINNACLE WHEN THEY HAVE FELT
7170-281510-0025 THE SUNSHINE FOR A WHILE AND DOWNWARD GO LIKE LAUWINE LOOSENED FROM THE MOUNTAIN'S BELT OH FOR ONE HOUR OF BLIND OLD DANDOLO THE OCTOGENARIAN CHIEF
7170-281510-0026 THEIR GILDED COLLARS GLITTERING IN THE SUN BUT IS NOT DORIA'S MENACE COME TO PASS ARE THEY NOT BRIDLED VENICE LOST AND WON HER THIRTEEN HUNDRED YEARS OF FREEDOM DONE
7170-281510-0027 BETTER BE WHELMED BENEATH THE WAVES AND SHUN EVEN IN DESTRUCTION'S DEPTH HER FOREIGN FOES FROM WHOM SUBMISSION WRINGS AN INFAMOUS REPOSE
7170-281510-0028 HER VERY BYWORD SPRUNG FROM VICTORY THE PLANTER OF THE LION WHICH THROUGH FIRE
7170-281510-0029 THOUGH MAKING MANY SLAVES HERSELF STILL FREE AND EUROPE'S BULWARK GAINST THE OTTOMITE WITNESS TROY'S RIVAL CANDIA
7170-281510-0030 VOUCH IT YE IMMORTAL WAVES THAT SAW LEPANTO'S FIGHT FOR YE ARE NAMES NO TIME
7170-281510-0031 OF HER DEAD DOGES ARE DECLINED TO DUST BUT WHERE THEY DWELT THE VAST AND SUMPTUOUS PILE BESPEAKS THE PAGEANT OF THEIR SPLENDID TRUST THEIR SCEPTRE BROKEN AND THEIR SWORD IN RUST
7170-281510-0032 HAVE YIELDED TO THE STRANGER EMPTY HALLS THIN STREETS AND FOREIGN ASPECTS SUCH AS MUST TOO OFT REMIND HER WHO AND WHAT ENTHRALS
7170-281510-0033 AND FETTERED THOUSANDS BORE THE YOKE OF WAR REDEMPTION ROSE UP IN THE ATTIC MUSE HER VOICE THEIR ONLY RANSOM FROM AFAR SEE AS THEY CHANT THE TRAGIC HYMN THE CAR
7170-281510-0034 OF THE O'ERMASTERED VICTOR STOPS THE REINS
7170-281510-0035 THY LOVE OF TASSO SHOULD HAVE CUT THE KNOT WHICH TIES THEE TO THY TYRANTS AND THY LOT IS SHAMEFUL TO THE NATIONS
7170-281510-0036 IN THE FALL OF VENICE THINK OF THINE
7170-281510-0037 SHE TO ME WAS AS A FAIRY CITY OF THE HEART RISING LIKE WATER COLUMNS FROM THE SEA OF JOY THE SOJOURN AND OF WEALTH THE MART AND OTWAY RADCLIFFE SCHILLER
7170-281510-0038 SHAKSPEARE'S ART HAD STAMPED HER IMAGE IN ME AND E E N SO ALTHOUGH I FOUND HER THUS WE DID NOT PART PERCHANCE E E N DEARER IN HER DAY OF WOE
7170-281510-0039 THAN WHEN SHE WAS A BOAST A MARVEL
7170-281510-0040 AND OF THE PRESENT THERE IS STILL FOR EYE AND THOUGHT AND MEDITATION CHASTENED DOWN ENOUGH AND MORE IT MAY BE THAN I HOPED OR SOUGHT
