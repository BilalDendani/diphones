6792-73035-0000 WOULD MEN SAY TO YOU HARRY TELL ME THE TRUTH TELL ME ALL THE TRUTH HARRY CLAVERING WAS THUS GREETED WHEN
6792-73035-0001 HE WENT TO HER ALMOST IMMEDIATELY ON HIS RETURN TO LONDON IT WILL BE REMEMBERED
6792-73035-0002 LACKING THE COURAGE TO FACE HIS MISFORTUNES BOLDLY BUT THOUGH HIS DELAY HAD BEEN COWARDLY
6792-73035-0003 HE DESPISED HIMSELF FOR NOT HAVING WRITTEN WITH WARM
6792-73035-0004 AND WITH HONEST CLEAR TRUTH TO JULIA HALF HIS MISERY ROSE FROM THIS FEELING OF SELF ABASEMENT AND FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE WAS WEAK PITEOUSLY WEAK
6792-73035-0005 EXACTLY IN THAT IN WHICH HE HAD OFTEN BOASTED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS STRONG BUT SUCH INWARD BOASTINGS ARE NOT ALTOGETHER BAD THEY PRESERVE MEN FROM SUCCUMBING AND MAKE AT ANY RATE SOME ATTEMPT TO REALIZE THEMSELVES
6792-73035-0006 BUT AS HE WENT HE COULD NOT KEEP HIMSELF FROM ARGUING THE MATTER WITHIN HIS OWN BREAST HE KNEW WHAT WAS HIS DUTY IT WAS HIS DUTY TO STICK TO FLORENCE NOT ONLY WITH HIS WORD AND HIS HAND
6792-73035-0007 BUT WITH HIS HEART IT WAS HIS DUTY
6792-73035-0008 NOT ONLY HIS WORD WAS AT STRATTON BUT HIS HEART ALSO AND TO ASK HER PARDON FOR THE WRONG THAT HE HAD DONE HER BY THAT CARESS FOR SOME TEN MINUTES AS HE WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS HIS RESOLVE WAS STRONG TO DO THIS MANIFEST DUTY
6792-73035-0009 BUT GRADUALLY AS HE THOUGHT OF THAT CARESS AS HE THOUGHT OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE COMING INTERVIEW AS HE THOUGHT OF JULIA'S HIGH TONED BEAUTY PERHAPS SOMETHING ALSO OF HER WEALTH AND BIRTH
6792-73035-0010 WITHOUT HIS HEART COULD IT REALLY BE GOOD FOR FLORENCE POOR INJURED FLORENCE THAT SHE SHOULD BE TAKEN BY A MAN WHO HAD CEASED TO REGARD HER MORE THAN ALL OTHER WOMEN
6792-73035-0011 DECEIT BE WORSE THAN THE OTHER DECEIT OR RATHER WOULD NOT THAT BE DECEITFUL WHEREAS THE OTHER COURSE WOULD SIMPLY BE UNFORTUNATE UNFORTUNATE THROUGH CIRCUMSTANCES FOR WHICH HE WAS BLAMELESS
6792-73035-0012 DAMNABLE ARGUMENTS FALSE COWARDLY LOGIC BY WHICH ALL MALE JILTS SEEK TO EXCUSE THEIR OWN TREACHERY TO THEMSELVES AND TO OTHERS THUS DURING THE SECOND TEN MINUTES OF HIS WALK HIS LINE OF CONDUCT BECAME LESS PLAIN TO HIM
6792-73035-0013 AND AS HE ENTERED PICCADILLY HE WAS RACKED WITH DOUBTS BUT INSTEAD OF SETTLING THEM IN HIS MIND HE UNCONSCIOUSLY ALLOWED HIMSELF TO DWELL UPON THE WORDS WITH WHICH HE WOULD SEEK TO EXCUSE HIS TREACHERY TO FLORENCE HE THOUGHT HOW HE WOULD TELL HER
6792-73035-0014 NOT TO HER FACE WITH SPOKEN WORDS FOR THAT HE COULD NOT DO BUT WITH WRITTEN SKILL THAT HE WAS UNWORTHY OF HER GOODNESS THAT HIS LOVE FOR HER HAD FALLEN OFF THROUGH HIS OWN UNWORTHINESS
6792-73035-0015 AND HAD RETURNED TO ONE WHO WAS IN ALL RESPECTS LESS PERFECT THAN SHE BUT WHO IN OLD DAYS AS SHE WELL KNEW HAD BEEN HIS FIRST LOVE YES HE WOULD SAY ALL THIS AND JULIA
6792-73035-0016 LET HER ANGER BE WHAT IT MIGHT SHOULD KNOW THAT HE HAD SAID IT AS HE PLANNED THIS THERE CAME TO HIM A LITTLE COMFORT FOR HE THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING GRAND IN SUCH A RESOLUTION YES HE WOULD DO THAT
6792-73035-0017 EVEN THOUGH HE SHOULD LOSE JULIA ALSO MISERABLE CLAP TRAP HE KNEW IN HIS HEART THAT ALL HIS LOGIC WAS FALSE AND HIS ARGUMENTS BASELESS CEASE TO LOVE FLORENCE BURTON HE HAD NOT CEASED TO LOVE HER
6792-73035-0018 NOR IS THE HEART OF ANY MAN MADE SO LIKE A WEATHERCOCK THAT IT NEEDS MUST TURN ITSELF HITHER AND THITHER AS THE WIND DIRECTS
6792-73035-0019 FOR HARRY WITH ALL HIS FAULTS AND IN SPITE OF HIS PRESENT FALSENESS WAS A MAN NO MAN CEASES TO LOVE WITHOUT A CAUSE NO MAN NEED CEASE TO LOVE WITHOUT A CAUSE A MAN MAY MAINTAIN HIS LOVE
6792-73035-0020 AND NOURISH IT AND KEEP IT WARM BY HONEST MANLY EFFORT AS HE MAY HIS PROBITY HIS COURAGE OR HIS HONOR IT WAS NOT THAT HE HAD CEASED TO LOVE FLORENCE BUT THAT THE GLARE OF THE CANDLE HAD BEEN TOO BRIGHT FOR HIM AND HE HAD SCORCHED HIS WINGS
6792-73035-0021 AFTER ALL AS TO THAT EMBRACE OF WHICH HE HAD THOUGHT SO MUCH AND THE MEMORY OF WHICH WAS SO SWEET TO HIM AND SO BITTER IT HAD SIMPLY BEEN AN ACCIDENT
6792-73035-0022 THUS WRITING IN HIS MIND THAT LETTER TO FLORENCE WHICH HE KNEW IF HE WERE AN HONEST MAN HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW HIMSELF TO WRITE HE REACHED LADY ONGAR'S DOOR WITHOUT HAVING ARRANGED FOR HIMSELF ANY SPECIAL LINE OF CONDUCT
6792-73035-0023 WE MUST RETURN FOR A MOMENT TO THE FACT THAT HUGH AND ARCHIE HAD RETURNED TO TOWN BEFORE HARRY CLAVERING HOW ARCHIE HAD BEEN ENGAGED ON GREAT DOINGS THE READER I HOPE WILL REMEMBER AND HE MAY AS WELL BE INFORMED HERE
6792-73035-0024 THAT THE FIFTY POUNDS WAS DULY TAKEN TO MOUNT STREET AND WERE EXTRACTED FROM HIM BY THE SPY WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY
6792-73035-0025 OR VALUABLE INFORMATION FROM SOPHIE GORDELOUP BUT SOPHIE DID OBTAIN SOME INFORMATION FROM HIM WHICH SHE FOUND HERSELF ABLE TO USE FOR HER OWN PURPOSES AS HIS POSITION WITH REFERENCE TO LOVE AND MARRIAGE WAS BEING DISCUSSED
6792-73035-0026 AND THE POSITION ALSO OF THE DIVINE JULIA SOPHIE HINTED HER FEAR OF ANOTHER CLAVERING LOVER WHAT DID ARCHIE THINK OF HIS COUSIN HARRY WHY HE'S ENGAGED TO ANOTHER GIRL SAID ARCHIE
6792-73035-0027 OPENING WIDE HIS EYES AND HIS MOUTH AND BECOMING VERY FREE WITH HIS INFORMATION THIS WAS A MATTER TO WHICH SOPHIE FOUND IT WORTH HER WHILE TO ATTEND AND SHE SOON LEARNED FROM ARCHIE ALL THAT ARCHIE KNEW ABOUT FLORENCE BURTON
6792-73035-0028 AND THIS WAS ALL THAT COULD BE KNOWN NO SECRET HAD BEEN MADE IN THE FAMILY OF HARRY'S ENGAGEMENT ARCHIE TOLD HIS FAIR ASSISTANT THAT MISS BURTON HAD BEEN RECEIVED AT CLAVERING PARK OPENLY AS HARRY'S FUTURE WIFE AND
6792-73035-0029 BY JOVE YOU KNOW HE CAN'T BE COMING IT WITH JULIA AFTER THAT YOU KNOW
6792-73035-0030 SHE REMEMBERING THAT SHE HAD CAUGHT LADY ONGAR IN HARRY'S ARMS THOUGHT THAT BY JOVE HE MIGHT BE COMING IT WITH JULIA EVEN AFTER MISS BURTON'S RECEPTION AT CLAVERING PARK THEN TOO SHE REMEMBERED SOME FEW WORDS THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HER
6792-73035-0031 AND HER DEAR JULIA AFTER HARRY'S DEPARTURE ON THE EVENING OF THE EMBRACE AND PERCEIVED THAT JULIA WAS IN IGNORANCE OF THE VERY EXISTENCE OF FLORENCE BURTON EVEN THOUGH FLORENCE HAD BEEN RECEIVED AT THE PARK THIS WAS INFORMATION WORTH HAVING
6792-73035-0032 INFORMATION TO BE USED HER RESPECT FOR HARRY ROSE IMMEASURABLY SHE HAD NOT GIVEN HIM CREDIT FOR SO MUCH AUDACITY SO MUCH GALLANTRY AND SO MUCH SKILL SHE HAD THOUGHT HIM TO BE A PIGHEADED CLAVERING
6792-73035-0033 THEREFORE THE INFORMATION SHOULD BE USED AND IT WAS USED THE READER WILL NOW UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE TRUTH WHICH LADY ONGAR DEMANDED FROM HARRY CLAVERING HARRY TELL ME THE TRUTH TELL ME ALL THE TRUTH
6792-73035-0034 SHE HAD COME FORWARD TO MEET HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WHEN SHE SPOKE THESE WORDS AND STOOD LOOKING HIM IN THE FACE NOT HAVING GIVEN HIM HER HAND WHAT TRUTH SAID HARRY HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU A LIE
6792-73035-0035 BUT HE KNEW WELL WHAT WAS THE TRUTH REQUIRED OF HIM LIES CAN BE ACTED AS WELL AS TOLD HARRY TELL ME ALL AT ONCE WHO IS FLORENCE BURTON WHO AND WHAT SHE KNEW IT ALL THEN
6792-73035-0036 AND THINGS HAD SETTLED THEMSELVES FOR HIM WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF ANY ACTION ON HIS PART IT WAS ODD ENOUGH THAT SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE LEARNED IT BEFORE BUT AT ANY RATE SHE KNEW IT NOW
6792-73035-0037 ONLY HOW WAS HE TO EXCUSE HIMSELF FOR THAT EMBRACE AT ANY RATE SPEAK TO ME SHE SAID STANDING QUITE ERECT AND LOOKING AS A JUNO MIGHT HAVE LOOKED YOU WILL ACKNOWLEDGE AT LEAST THAT I HAVE A RIGHT TO ASK THE QUESTION WHO IS THIS FLORENCE BURTON
6792-73035-0038 SHE IS THE DAUGHTER OF MISTER BURTON OF STRATTON AND

6792-73035-0041 THERE HAD BEEN NO REVENGE THAT HE HAD LOVED AND SUFFERED AND FORGIVEN WITHOUT ONE THOUGHT OF ANGER AND THAT THEN HE HAD UNFORTUNATELY LOVED AGAIN MUST HE NOT FIND SOME WORDS IN WHICH TO TELL HER THAT
6792-73035-0042 SHE HAD BEEN THE LIGHT AND HE SIMPLY THE POOR MOTH THAT HAD BURNED HIS WINGS NO LADY ONGAR SAID HE THERE HAS BEEN NO REVENGE WE WILL CALL IS JUSTICE IF YOU PLEASE AT ANY RATE I DO NOT MEAN TO COMPLAIN

6792-73035-0051 AND THERE WAS A TEAR WHICH MADE DIM HER EYE AND SHE KNEW THAT SHE COULD NO LONGER STAND BEFORE HIM SHE ENDEAVORED TO SEAT HERSELF WITH COMPOSURE BUT THE ATTEMPT FAILED AND AS SHE FELL BACK UPON THE SOFA
6792-73035-0052 HE JUST HEARD THE SOB WHICH HAD COST HER SO GREAT AND VAIN AN EFFORT TO RESTRAIN IN AN INSTANT HE WAS KNEELING AT HER FEET AND GRASPING AT THE HAND WITH WHICH SHE WAS HIDING HER FACE JULIA HE SAID LOOK AT ME

6792-73035-0059 WHEN I THOUGHT YOU STILL LOVED ME LOVED ME IN SPITE OF MY PAST SIN THAT I ALMOST FORGOT THAT I WAS POLLUTED
6792-73035-0060 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR HIM HAD HE GONE AWAY AT ONCE NOW HE WAS SITTING IN A CHAIR SOBBING VIOLENTLY AND PRESSING AWAY THE TEARS FROM HIS CHEEKS WITH HIS HANDS HOW COULD HE MAKE HER UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAD INTENDED NO INSULT WHEN HE EMBRACED HER
6792-73035-0061 WAS DONE TO FLORENCE BURTON AND NOT TO HER BUT HIS AGONY WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM AT PRESENT AND HE COULD FIND NO WORDS IN WHICH TO SPEAK TO HER I SAID TO MYSELF THAT YOU WOULD COME WHEN THE FUNERAL WAS OVER AND I WEPT FOR POOR HERMY
6792-73035-0062 AS I THOUGHT THAT MY LOT WAS SO MUCH HAPPIER THAN HERS BUT PEOPLE HAVE WHAT THEY DESERVE AND HERMY WHO HAS DONE NO SUCH WRONG AS I HAVE DONE IS NOT CRUSHED AS I AM CRUSHED IT WAS JUST HARRY THAT THE PUNISHMENT SHOULD COME FROM YOU BUT IT HAS COME VERY HEAVILY
6792-73035-0063 JULIA IT WAS NOT MEANT TO BE SO WELL WE WILL LET THAT PASS I CANNOT UNSAY HARRY ALL THAT I HAVE SAID ALL THAT I DID NOT SAY BUT WHICH YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT AND KNOWN WHEN YOU WERE HERE LAST I CANNOT BID YOU BELIEVE THAT I DO NOT LOVE YOU
6792-73035-0064 NOT MORE TENDERLY OR TRULY THAN I LOVE YOU NAY HARRY YOUR LOVE TO ME CAN BE NEITHER TRUE NOR TENDER NOR WILL I PERMIT IT TO BE OFFERED TO ME YOU DO NOT THINK THAT I WOULD ROB THAT GIRL OF WHAT IS HERS MINE FOR YOU

6792-73035-0066 FOR AT FIRST I DID NOT EXPECT THAT YOU WOULD FORGIVE ME AND LET ME BE DEAR TO YOU AS I USED TO BE BUT AS YOU SAT HERE
6792-73035-0067 AND I THOUGHT THAT I MIGHT FORGIVE MYSELF AT LAST FOR POSSESSING THIS MONEY
6792-73035-0068 TILL I SHOULD SEE WHETHER YOU REALLY LOVED ME BUT THEN CAME THAT BURST OF PASSION AND THOUGH I KNEW THAT YOU WERE WRONG I WAS PROUD TO FEEL THAT I WAS STILL SO DEAR TO YOU IT IS ALL OVER WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER AT LAST
6792-73035-0069 AND YOU MAY GO THERE IS NOTHING TO BE FORGIVEN BETWEEN US HE HAD NOW RESOLVED THAT FLORENCE MUST GO BY THE BOARD IF JULIA WOULD STILL TAKE HIM SHE SHOULD BE HIS WIFE AND HE WOULD FACE FLORENCE AND ALL THE BURTONS
6792-73035-0070 AND HIS OWN FAMILY AND ALL THE WORLD IN THE MATTER OF HIS TREACHERY WHAT WOULD HE CARE WHAT THE WORLD MIGHT SAY HIS TREACHERY TO FLORENCE WAS A THING COMPLETED NOW AT THIS MOMENT
6792-73035-0071 AS ONE WHICH MUST AT ALL HAZARDS BE RENOUNCED HE THOUGHT OF HIS MOTHER'S SORROW OF HIS FATHER'S SCORN OF THE DISMAY WITH WHICH FANNY WOULD HEAR CONCERNING HIM A TALE
6792-73035-0072 HE THOUGHT OF THEODORE BURTON AND THE DEEP UNQUENCHABLE ANGER OF WHICH THAT BROTHER WAS CAPABLE AND OF CECILIA AND HER OUTRAGED KINDNESS HE THOUGHT OF THE INFAMY WHICH WOULD BE ATTACHED TO HIM AND RESOLVED THAT HE MUST BEAR IT ALL
6792-73035-0073 HOW COULD HE HINDER HIMSELF FROM GIVING COMFORT AND HAPPINESS TO THIS WOMAN WHO WAS BEFORE HIM INJURY WRONG AND BROKEN HEARTED WRETCHEDNESS HE COULD NOT PREVENT BUT THEREFORE THIS PART WAS AS OPEN TO HIM AS THE OTHER
6792-73035-0074 MEN WOULD SAY
6792-73035-0075 AND THE INDIGNATION WITH WHICH HE WAS ABLE TO REGARD THIS FALSE ACCUSATION FOR HIS MIND DECLARED SUCH ACCUSATION TO BE DAMNABLY FALSE GAVE HIM SOME COMFORT PEOPLE MIGHT SAY OF HIM WHAT THEY PLEASED
6792-73035-0076 BAD ALAS WAS THE BEST BUT IT WAS OF NO AVAIL NOW TO THINK OF THAT JULIA HE SAID BETWEEN US AT LEAST THERE SHALL BE NOTHING TO BE FORGIVEN
6792-73035-0077 AND WHAT THEN OF YOUR TRUTH TO MISS FLORENCE BURTON IT WILL NOT BE FOR YOU TO REBUKE ME WITH THAT WE HAVE BOTH OF US PLAYED OUR GAME BADLY BUT NOT FOR THAT REASON NEED WE BOTH BE RUINED AND BROKEN HEARTED
6792-73035-0078 IN YOUR FOLLY YOU THOUGHT THAT WEALTH WAS BETTER THAN LOVE AND I IN MY FOLLY I THOUGHT THAT ONE LOVE BLIGHTED MIGHT BE MENDED BY ANOTHER WHEN I ASKED MISS BURTON TO BE MY WIFE YOU WERE THE WIFE OF ANOTHER MAN
6792-73035-0079 NOW THAT YOU ARE FREE AGAIN I CANNOT MARRY MISS BURTON YOU MUST MARRY HER HARRY THERE SHALL BE NO MUST
6792-73035-0080 AND WHAT WOULD MEN SAY OF YOU
6792-73035-0081 WHEN THINGS HAVE ONCE GONE WRONG THEY CANNOT BE MENDED WITHOUT SHOWING THE PATCHES BUT YET MEN STAY THE HAND OF RUIN FOR A WHILE TINKERING HERE AND PUTTING IN A NAIL THERE STITCHING AND COBBLING AND SO THINGS ARE KEPT TOGETHER
6792-73035-0082 IT MUST BE SO FOR YOU AND ME GIVE ME YOUR HAND JULIA FOR I HAVE NEVER DECEIVED YOU AND YOU NEED NOT FEAR THAT I SHALL DO SO NOW GIVE ME YOUR HAND AND SAY THAT YOU WILL BE MY WIFE NO HARRY NOT YOUR WIFE I DO NOT AS YOU SAY

6792-73035-0084 GIVE ME YOUR HAND THEN COMING TO HER HE TOOK HER HAND
6792-73035-0085 BUT SHE WOULD NOT SAY THE WORDS SHE WAS LESS SELFISH THAN HE AND WAS THINKING WAS TRYING TO THINK WHAT MIGHT BE BEST FOR THEM ALL BUT ABOVE ALL WHAT MIGHT BE BEST FOR HIM SPEAK TO ME HE SAID AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU WRONGED ME
6792-73035-0086 SAY THAT YOU WILL BE MY WIFE NO I WILL NOT SAY IT SHE ROSE AGAIN FROM HER CHAIR AND TOOK HER HAND AWAY FROM HIM I WILL NOT SAY IT GO NOW AND THINK OVER ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE AND I ALSO WILL THINK OF IT GOD HELP ME
6792-73035-0087 WHAT EVIL COMES WHEN EVIL HAS BEEN DONE BUT HARRY I UNDERSTAND YOU NOW AND I AT LEAST WILL BLAME YOU NO MORE GO AND SEE FLORENCE BURTON
6792-73035-0088 YOU SHALL NEVER HEAR ANOTHER REPROACH FROM ME GO NOW GO THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID HE PAUSED A MOMENT AS THOUGH HE WERE GOING TO SPEAK BUT HE LEFT THE ROOM WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
6792-73035-0089 LOOKING AT HIM AND IT SEEMED THAT HER EYES WERE IMPLORING HIM TO BE TRUE TO HER IN SPITE OF THE WORDS THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN AND I WILL BE TRUE TO HER HE SAID TO HIMSELF SHE WAS THE FIRST THAT I EVER LOVED AND I WILL BE TRUE TO HER
6792-73035-0090 HE WENT OUT AND FOR AN HOUR OR TWO WANDERED ABOUT THE TOWN HARDLY KNOWING WHITHER HIS STEPS WERE TAKING HIM THERE HAD BEEN A TRAGIC SERIOUSNESS IN WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM THIS EVENING WHICH SEEMED TO COVER HIM WITH CARE
6792-73035-0091 AND MAKE HIM FEEL THAT HIS YOUTH WAS GONE FROM HIM AT ANY FORMER PERIOD OF HIS LIFE HIS EARS WOULD HAVE TINGLED WITH PRIDE
6792-73035-0092 IN SUCH TERMS AS SHE HAD USED BUT THERE WAS NO ROOM NOW FOR PRIDE IN HIS BOSOM NOW AT LEAST HE THOUGHT NOTHING OF HER WEALTH OR RANK HE THOUGHT OF HER AS A WOMAN BETWEEN WHOM AND HIMSELF THERE EXISTED SO STRONG A PASSION
6792-73035-0093 AS TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD MARRY ANOTHER EVEN THOUGH HIS DUTY PLAINLY REQUIRED IT THE GRACE AND GRACIOUSNESS OF HIS LIFE WERE OVER BUT LOVE STILL REMAINED TO HIM AND OF THAT HE MUST MAKE THE MOST
6792-73035-0094 ALL OTHERS WHOM HE REGARDED WOULD REVILE HIM AND NOW HE MUST LIVE FOR THIS WOMAN ALONE SHE HAD SAID THAT SHE HAD INJURED HIM YES INDEED SHE HAD INJURED HIM
6792-73035-0095 SHE HAD ROBBED HIM OF HIS HIGH CHARACTER OF HIS UNCLOUDED BROW OF THAT SELF PRIDE
6792-73035-0096 SHE HAD BROUGHT HIM TO A STATE IN WHICH MISERY MUST BE HIS BEDFELLOW AND DISGRACE HIS COMPANION BUT STILL SHE LOVED HIM
6792-73035-0097 HOW WAS HE TO SETTLE MATTERS WITH HER THAT LETTER FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN PREPARING THE WORDS AS HE WENT TO BOLTON STREET BEFORE THE NECESSITY FOR IT HAD BECOME IRREVOCABLE DID NOT NOW APPEAR TO HIM TO BE VERY EASY
