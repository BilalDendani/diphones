7746-104992-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN HARDLY A COINCIDENCE THE OLD LADY'S EYES MET OURS WITHOUT PURPOSE OR INTELLIGENCE IT WAS PLAIN THAT SHE DID NOT SEE US
7746-104992-0001 ALSO PLAIN THAT SHE WAS HELD BACK IN HER ADVANCE BY SOME DOUBT IN HER BECLOUDED BRAIN WE COULD SEE HER HOVER AS IT WERE AT HER END OF THE DARK PASSAGE WHILE I HELD MY BREATH AND MISTER STEELE PANTED AUDIBLY
7746-104992-0002 THEN GRADUALLY SHE DREW BACK AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE DOOR WHICH SHE FORGOT TO SHUT AS WE COULD TELL FROM THE GRADUALLY RECEDING LIGHT AND THE FAINT FALL OF HER FOOTSTEPS AFTER THE LAST DIM FLICKER HAD FADED AWAY
7746-104992-0003 WHEN SHE WAS QUITE GONE MISTER STEELE SPOKE YOU MUST BE SATISFIED NOW HE SAID DO YOU STILL WISH TO GO ON OR SHALL WE RETURN AND EXPLAIN THIS ACCIDENT TO THE GIRLS WHOSE VOICES I CERTAINLY HEAR IN THE HALL OVERHEAD
7746-104992-0004 WITH THE VISITS WHICH HAD FROM TIME TO TIME DEPOPULATED THIS HOUSE I SHALL LEAVE YOU TO MAKE THE NECESSARY EXPLANATIONS SAID HE I AM REALLY RUSHED WITH BUSINESS AND SHOULD BE DOWN TOWN ON THE MAYOR'S AFFAIRS AT THIS VERY MOMENT
7746-104992-0005 I AM QUITE READY SAID I THEN AS I SQUEEZED MY WAY THROUGH BETWEEN THE CORNER OF THE CABINET AND THE FOUNDATION WALL I COULD NOT HELP ASKING HIM HOW HE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE
7746-104992-0006 FOR THESE OLD LADIES TO MOUNT TO THE HALLS ABOVE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE FOUR FOOT HOLE IN WHICH WE NOW STOOD
7746-104992-0007 HE REPLIED LIFTING INTO VIEW THE OBJECT WE HAD SEEN AT ONE SIDE OF THE PASSAGE AND WHICH NOW SHOWED ITSELF TO BE A PAIR OF FOLDING STEPS
7746-104992-0008 WITH MEANS OF GETTING OUT OF IT SHALL I HELP YOU IN A MINUTE I SAID I AM SO CURIOUS HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY WORKED THIS TRAP FROM HERE THEY DID NOT PRESS THE SPRING IN THE MOLDING
7746-104992-0009 HE POINTED TO ONE SIDE OF THE OPENING WHERE PART OF THE SUPPORTING MECHANISM WAS NOW VISIBLE THEY WORKED THAT IT IS ALL SIMPLE ENOUGH ON THIS SIDE OF THE TRAP THE PUZZLE IS ABOUT THE OTHER
7746-104992-0010 HOW DID THEY MANAGE TO HAVE ALL THIS MECHANISM PUT IN WITHOUT ROUSING ANY ONE'S ATTENTION AND WHY SO MUCH TROUBLE SOME TIME I WILL TELL YOU I REPLIED PUTTING MY FOOT ON THE STEP O GIRLS I EXCLAIMED
7746-104992-0011 AS TWO SCREAMS RANG OUT ABOVE AND TWO AGITATED FACES PEERED DOWN UPON US I'VE HAD AN ACCIDENT AND A GREAT ADVENTURE BUT I'VE SOLVED THE MYSTERY OF THE GHOST IT WAS JUST ONE OF THE TWO POOR OLD LADIES NEXT DOOR
7746-104992-0012 THEY USED TO COME UP THROUGH THIS TRAP WHERE IS MISSUS PACKARD THEY WERE TOO SPEECHLESS WITH WONDER TO ANSWER ME I HAD TO REACH UP MY ARMS TWICE BEFORE EITHER OF THEM WOULD LEND ME A HELPING HAND
7746-104992-0013 AND MISTER STEELE AFTER ME THE QUESTIONS THEY ASKED CAME SO THICK AND FAST THAT I ALMOST CHOKED IN MY ENDEAVOR TO ANSWER THEM AND TO GET AWAY NIXON APPEARED IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND CONGRATULATING MYSELF THAT MISTER STEELE
7746-104992-0014 HAD BEEN ABLE TO SLIP AWAY TO THE STUDY WHILE I WAS TALKING TO THE GIRLS I WENT OVER THE WHOLE STORY AGAIN FOR HIS BENEFIT AFTER WHICH I STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND ASKED AGAIN WHERE MISSUS PACKARD WAS NIXON
7746-104992-0015 WITH A FACE AS BLACK AS THE PASSAGE FROM WHICH I HAD JUST ESCAPED MUTTERED SOME WORDS ABOUT QUEER DOINGS FOR RESPECTABLE PEOPLE BUT SAID NOTHING ABOUT HIS MISTRESS
7746-104992-0016 UNLESS THE FEW WORDS HE ADDED TO HIS FINAL LAMENT ABOUT THE CABINET CONTAINED SOME ALLUSION TO HER FONDNESS FOR THE ARTICLES IT HELD WE COULD ALL SEE THAT THEY HAD SUFFERED GREATLY FROM THEIR FALL ANNOYED AT HIS MANNER
7746-104992-0017 WHICH WAS THAT OF A MAN PERSONALLY AGGRIEVED I TURNED TO ELLEN YOU HAVE JUST BEEN UP STAIRS I SAID IS MISSUS PACKARD STILL IN THE NURSERY SHE WAS BUT NOT MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES AGO SHE SLIPPED DOWN STAIRS AND WENT OUT
7746-104992-0018 IT WAS JUST BEFORE THE NOISE YOU MADE FALLING DOWN INTO THIS HOLE OUT I WAS SORRY I WANTED TO DISBURDEN MYSELF AT ONCE WELL LEAVE EVERYTHING AS IT IS I COMMANDED DESPITE THE REBELLION IN NIXON'S EYE
7746-104992-0019 I WILL WAIT IN THE RECEPTION ROOM TILL SHE RETURNS AND THEN TELL HER AT ONCE SHE CAN BLAME NOBODY BUT ME IF SHE IS DISPLEASED AT WHAT SHE SEES NIXON GRUMBLED SOMETHING AND MOVED OFF THE GIRLS FULL OF TALK
7746-104992-0020 RAN UP STAIRS TO HAVE IT OUT IN THE NURSERY WITH LETTY AND I WENT TOWARD THE FRONT HOW LONG I SHOULD HAVE TO STAY THERE BEFORE MISSUS PACKARD'S RETURN I DID NOT KNOW SHE MIGHT STAY AWAY AN HOUR AND SHE MIGHT STAY AWAY ALL DAY
7746-104992-0021 I COULD SIMPLY WAIT BUT IT WAS A HAPPY WAITING I SHOULD SEE A RENEWAL OF JOY IN HER AND A BOUNDING HOPE FOR THE FUTURE WHEN ONCE I TOLD ANY TALE
7746-104992-0022 WHEN IT CAME IT WAS ALREADY LUNCH TIME BUT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF HURRY IN HER MANNER THERE WAS RATHER AN ALMOST PAINFUL HESITATION AS SHE DREW NEARER
7746-104992-0023 SHE RAISED HER EYES TO THE HOUSE FRONT AND I SAW WITH WHAT DREAD SHE APPROACHED IT AND WHAT COURAGE IT TOOK FOR HER TO ENTER IT AT ALL THE SIGHT OF MY FACE AT THE WINDOW ALTERED HER EXPRESSION HOWEVER AND SHE CAME QUITE CHEERFULLY UP THE STEPS
7746-104992-0024 CAREFUL TO FORESTALL NIXON IN HIS DUTY I OPENED THE FRONT DOOR AND DRAWING HER INTO THE ROOM WHERE I HAD BEEN WAITING I BLURTED OUT MY WHOLE STORY BEFORE SHE COULD REMOVE HER HAT O MISSUS PACKARD I CRIED
7746-104992-0025 I HAVE SUCH GOOD NEWS FOR YOU THE THING YOU FEARED HASN'T ANY MEANING THE HOUSE WAS NEVER HAUNTED THE SHADOWS WHICH HAVE BEEN SEEN HERE WERE THE SHADOWS OF REAL BEINGS THERE IS A SECRET ENTRANCE TO THIS HOUSE
7746-104992-0026 AND THROUGH IT THE OLD LADIES NEXT DOOR HAVE COME FROM TIME TO TIME IN SEARCH OF THEIR MISSING BONDS OR ELSE TO FRIGHTEN OFF ALL OTHER PEOPLE FROM THE CHANCE OF FINDING THEM SHALL I SHOW YOU WHERE THE PLACE IS
7746-104992-0027 HER FACE WHEN I BEGAN HAD SHOWN SUCH CHANGES I WAS STARTLED BUT BY THE TIME I HAD FINISHED A SORT OF APATHY HAD FALLEN ACROSS IT AND HER VOICE SOUNDED HOLLOW AS SHE CRIED WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME
7746-104992-0028 A SECRET ENTRANCE WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT AND THE MISSES QUINLAN USING IT TO HUNT ABOUT THESE HALLS AT NIGHT ROMANTIC TO BE SURE YES LET ME SEE THE PLACE IT IS VERY INTERESTING AND VERY INCONVENIENT
7746-104992-0029 WILL YOU TELL NIXON PLEASE TO HAVE THIS PASSAGE CLOSED I FELT A CHILL IF IT WAS INTEREST SHE FELT IT WAS A VERY FORCED ONE SHE EVEN PAUSED TO TAKE OFF HER HAT BUT WHEN I HAD DRAWN HER THROUGH THE LIBRARY INTO THE SIDE HALL
7746-104992-0030 AND SHOWN HER THE GREAT GAP WHERE THE CABINET HAD STOOD I THOUGHT SHE BRIGHTENED A LITTLE AND SHOWED SOME OF THE CURIOSITY I EXPECTED BUT IT WAS VERY EASILY APPEASED AND BEFORE I COULD HAVE MADE THE THING CLEAR TO HER
7746-104992-0031 SHE WAS BACK IN THE LIBRARY FINGERING HER HAT AND LISTENING AS IT SEEMED TO ME TO EVERYTHING BUT MY VOICE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT MAKING ONE MORE EFFORT I CAME UP CLOSE TO HER AND IMPETUOUSLY CRIED OUT
7746-104992-0032 DON'T YOU SEE WHAT THIS DOES TO THE PHANTASM YOU PROFESSED TO HAVE SEEN YOURSELF ONCE IN THIS VERY SPOT IT PROVES IT A MYTH A PRODUCT OF YOUR OWN IMAGINATION SOMETHING WHICH IT MUST CERTAINLY BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU EVER TO FEAR AGAIN
7746-104992-0033 THAT IS WHY I MADE THE SEARCH WHICH HAS ENDED IN THIS DISCOVERY I WANTED TO RID YOU OF YOUR FOREBODINGS DO ASSURE ME THAT I HAVE IT WILL BE SUCH A COMFORT TO ME AND HOW MUCH MORE TO THE MAYOR HER LACK LUSTER EYES FELL
7746-104992-0034 HER FINGERS CLOSED ON THE HAT WHOSE FEATHERS SHE HAD BEEN TRIFLING WITH AND LIFTING IT SHE MOVED SOFTLY INTO THE RECEPTION ROOM AND FROM THERE INTO THE HALL AND UP THE FRONT STAIRS I STOOD AGHAST
7746-104992-0035 SHE HAD NOT EVEN HEARD WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING BY THE TIME I HAD RECOVERED MY EQUANIMITY ENOUGH TO FOLLOW SHE HAD DISAPPEARED INTO HER OWN ROOM IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN A VERY COMFORTABLE CONDITION
7746-104992-0036 FOR THERE WERE EVIDENCES ABOUT THE HALL THAT IT WAS BEING THOROUGHLY SWEPT AS I ENDEAVORED TO PASS THE DOOR I INADVERTENTLY STRUCK THE EDGE OF A LITTLE TABORET STANDING IN MY WAY IT TOPPLED AND A LITTLE BOOK
7746-104992-0037 LYING ON IT SLID TO THE FLOOR AS I STOOPED TO PICK IT UP MY ALREADY GREATLY DISCONCERTED MIND WAS STILL FURTHER AFFECTED BY THE GLIMPSE WHICH WAS GIVEN ME OF ITS TITLE IT WAS THIS
7746-104992-0038 SUGGESTING SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT FROM SPIRITUAL INTERFERENCE I ALLOWED THE BOOK TO OPEN IN MY HAND WHICH IT DID AT THIS EVIDENTLY FREQUENTLY CONNED PASSAGE A BOOK WAS IN MY HAND
7746-104992-0039 AND A STRONG LIGHT WAS SHINING ON IT AND ON ME FROM A LAMP ON A NEAR BY TABLE THE STORY WAS INTERESTING AND I WAS FOLLOWING THE ADVENTURES IT WAS RELATING WITH EAGER INTEREST WHEN SUDDENLY THE CHARACTER OF THE LIGHT CHANGED
7746-104992-0040 SEEMED TO PASS BEFORE MY EYES AND ON MY LOOKING UP I SAW STANDING BETWEEN ME AND THE LAMP THE FIGURE OF A MAN WHICH VANISHED AS I LOOKED LEAVING IN MY BREAST AN UNUTTERABLE DREAD
7746-104992-0041 AND IN MY MEMORY THE GLARE OF TWO UNEARTHLY EYES WHOSE MENACE COULD MEAN BUT ONE THING DEATH THE NEXT DAY I RECEIVED NEWS OF A FATAL ACCIDENT TO MY HUSBAND
7746-104992-0042 I CLOSED THE LITTLE VOLUME WITH VERY STRANGE THOUGHTS IF MAYOR PACKARD HAD BELIEVED HIMSELF TO HAVE RECEIVED AN EXPLANATION OF HIS WIFE'S STRANGE CONDITION IN THE CONFESSION SHE HAD MADE
