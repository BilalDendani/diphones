2792-152929-0000 H HALVORSEN A OLSEN F STELLER AND J ANDERSEN AT LAST WE WERE MORE OR LESS READY
2792-152929-0001 ON OUR FIRST HYDROGRAPHIC CRUISE IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC I SUPPOSE THERE WAS NO ONE ON BOARD ON JUNE EIGHTH NINETEEN TEN WHO DREAMED THAT A YEAR LATER WE SHOULD GO ON A SIMILAR CRUISE IN THE SOUTH
2792-152929-0002 WE HAD A PILOT ON BOARD AS FAR AS MONTEVIDEO WHERE WE ARRIVED ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE NINTH BUT ON ACCOUNT OF AN INCREASING WIND PAMPERO
2792-152929-0003 WE HAD TO LIE AT ANCHOR HERE FOR A DAY AND A HALF AS THE PILOT COULD NOT BE TAKEN OFF ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON THE TENTH HE WAS FETCHED OFF BY A BIG TUG BOAT
2792-152929-0004 THIS GENTLEMAN ASKED US IF WE COULD NOT COME INTO THE HARBOUR AS PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SHIP I PROMISED TO COME IN ON THE WAY BACK IF WE HAD TIME ON SUNDAY MORNING THE ELEVENTH
2792-152929-0005 WE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND WENT OUT IN THE MOST LOVELY WEATHER THAT CAN BE IMAGINED GRADUALLY THE LAND DISAPPEARED AND IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING WE LOST THE LIGHTS WE WERE ONCE MORE OUT IN THE ATLANTIC
2792-152929-0006 AND IMMEDIATELY EVERYTHING RESUMED ITS OLD COURSE IN ORDER TO SAVE OUR SUPPLY OF PRESERVED PROVISIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WE TOOK WITH US A QUANTITY OF LIVE POULTRY AND NO FEWER THAN TWENTY LIVE SHEEP
2792-152929-0007 WHICH WERE QUARTERED IN THE FARMYARD ON THE PORT SIDE OF THE VESSEL'S FORE DECK SHEEP AND HENS WERE ALL TOGETHER AND THERE WAS ALWAYS A MOST BEAUTIFUL SCENT OF HAY SO THAT WE HAD NOT ONLY SEA AIR BUT COUNTRY AIR
2792-152929-0008 IN SPITE OF ALL THIS DELIGHTFUL AIR THREE OR FOUR OF THE CREW WERE DOWN WITH INFLUENZA AND HAD TO KEEP THEIR BERTHS FOR SOME DAYS
2792-152929-0009 BY THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER AND ON GETTING IF POSSIBLE ONE STATION A DAY THE DISTANCE ACCORDING TO A ROUGH CALCULATION WAS ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND NAUTICAL MILES AND I LAID DOWN THE FOLLOWING PLAN
2792-152929-0010 AND NORTH WESTERLY WINDS TO THE COAST OF AFRICA AND THERE GET HOLD OF THE SOUTH EAST TRADE IF WE COULD NOT REACH AFRICA BEFORE THAT DATE THEN TO TURN ON JULY TWENTY SECOND AND LAY OUR COURSE
2792-152929-0011 WHICH WE COULD REACH BEFORE AUGUST FIRST FROM THERE AGAIN WITH THE SAME WIND TO SOUTH TRINIDAD AUGUST ELEVENTH OR TWELVE ON AGAIN WITH EASTERLY AND NORTH EASTERLY WINDS
2792-152929-0012 WHEN THE OBSERVATIONS WERE TO BE CONCLUDED AND WE SHOULD TRY TO MAKE BUENOS AIRES IN THE SHORTEST TIME THAT WAS THE PLAN THAT WE ATTEMPTED
2792-152929-0013 WE DID NOT BEGIN AT ONCE TO TAKE SAMPLES OF WATER AND WITH A HEAD WIND NORTH EAST WE LAY CLOSE HAULED FOR SOME DAYS WE ALSO HAD A PRETTY STIFF BREEZE
2792-152929-0014 FOR TAKING SAMPLES OF WATER A WINCH IS USED WITH A SOUNDING LINE OF LET US SAY FIVE THOUSAND METRES TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR FATHOMS ON WHICH ARE HUNG ONE OR MORE TUBES FOR CATCHING WATER
2792-152929-0015 WE USED THREE AT ONCE TO SAVE TIME NOW SUPPOSING WATER AND TEMPERATURES ARE TO BE TAKEN AT DEPTHS OF THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED METRES
2792-152929-0016 ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN AND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE FATHOMS
2792-152929-0017 FROM THE END OF THE LINE WHERE A SMALL WEIGHT A HANGS THEN IT IS LOWERED UNTIL THE INDICATOR WHEEL
2792-152929-0018 APPARATUS TWO IS THEN PUT ON AND IT IS LOWERED AGAIN FOR ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED METRES WHEN APPARATUS I IS PUT ON AND THE LINE PAID OUT FOR THREE HUNDRED METRES ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR FATHOMS THAT IS
2792-152929-0019 THE UPPER APPARATUS I IS THEN AT THREE HUNDRED METRES
2792-152929-0020 AND NO THREE AT FIVE HUNDRED METRES
2792-152929-0021 IS HUNG A SLIPPING SINKER ABOUT EIGHT CENTIMETRES
2792-152929-0022 WHICH REST IN BEARINGS ON THE FRAME SO THAT THE CYLINDER CAN BE SWUNG ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN THE CYLINDER WHILE BEING LOWERED IN AN INVERTED POSITION IS OPEN AT BOTH ENDS SO THAT THE WATER CAN PASS THROUGH
2792-152929-0023 WORKING ON HINGES AND PROVIDED WITH PACKING WHEN THE APPARATUS IS RELEASED THE CYLINDER SWINGS ROUND AND THESE VALVES THEN AUTOMATICALLY CLOSE THE ENDS OF THE CYLINDER
2792-152929-0024 AT THE REQUIRED DEPTH REMAINS IN IT WHILE IT IS BEING HEAVED UP AND IS COLLECTED IN BOTTLES WHEN THE APPARATUS IS RELEASED THE COLUMN OF MERCURY IN THE THERMOMETER IS BROKEN
2792-152929-0025 AS THE WATER IS TAKEN FROM THE RELEASE TAKES PLACE IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
2792-152929-0026 THEY ARE LEFT HANGING FOR A FEW MINUTES SO THAT THE THERMOMETERS MAY BE SET AT THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE BEFORE THE COLUMN OF MERCURY IS BROKEN
2792-152929-0027 WHEN THIS SINKER STRIKES THE FIRST APPARATUS A SPRING IS PRESSED
2792-152929-0028 AS ALREADY MENTIONED CLOSE THE ENDS OF THE CYLINDER WHICH IS FIXED IN ITS NEW POSITION BY A HOOK IN THE BOTTOM OF THE FRAME AT THE SAME INSTANT
2792-152929-0029 TO APPARATUS TWO WHERE THE SAME THING HAPPENS IT IS THEN REPEATED WITH APPARATUS THREE WHEN THEY ARE ALL READY THEY ARE HEAVED IN BY HOLDING ONE'S FINGER ON THE LINE ONE CAN FEEL
2792-152929-0030 WHEN THE SINKERS STRIKE AGAINST THE CYLINDERS BUT I USED TO LOOK AT MY WATCH
2792-152929-0031 THE NECESSARY DATA ARE ENTERED IN A BOOK ON THE MORNING OF THE SEVENTEENTH THEN THE SAILS WERE CLEWED UP
2792-152929-0032 WE FIRST TRIED TAKING SOUNDINGS WITH A SINKER OF SIXTY SIX POUNDS AND A TUBE FOR TAKING SPECIMENS OF THE SEA BED
2792-152929-0033 SO THAT SINKER TUBE AND OVER TWO THOUSAND METRES OF LINE CONTINUED THEIR WAY
2792-152929-0034 I HAD THOUGHT OF TAKING SAMPLES OF WATER AT FOUR THOUSAND THREE THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND METRES
2792-152929-0035 TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY NINE ONE THOUSAND AND NINETY THREE FATHOMS AND SO ON AND WATER CYLINDERS WERE PUT ON FROM ZERO TO TWO THOUSAND METRES
2792-152929-0036 THIS HOWEVER TOOK SIX HOURS NEXT DAY ON ACCOUNT OF THE HEAVY SEA ONLY A FEW SAMPLES FROM ZERO TO ONE HUNDRED METRES
2792-152929-0037 ON THE THIRD DAY WE MADE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO GET THE BOTTOM THIS TIME WE GOT SPECIMENS OF THE SEA BED FROM ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METRES
2792-152929-0038 AND TEMPERATURES OCCUPIED EIGHT HOURS FROM SEVEN A M TILL THREE P M
2792-152929-0039 THIS TIME WAS NOT AT OUR DISPOSAL
2792-152929-0040 AND SAMPLES OF WATER AT GREATER DEPTHS THAN ONE THOUSAND METRES
2792-152929-0041 FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TRIP WE TOOK TEMPERATURES AND SAMPLES OF WATER AT THE FOLLOWING DEPTHS
2792-152929-0042 THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY AND ONE THOUSAND METRES
2792-152929-0043 TWO AND THREE QUARTERS FIVE AND A HALF THIRTEEN AND A HALF
2792-152929-0044 FORTY ONE FIFTY FOUR EIGHTY ONE ONE HUNDRED EIGHT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE FOUR HUNDRED TEN AND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY SIX FATHOMS IN ALL
2792-152929-0045 FIFTEEN SAMPLES FROM EACH STATION AND FROM THIS TIME FORWARD WE WENT ON REGULARLY WITH ONE STATION EVERY DAY FINALLY WE MANAGED TO HEAVE UP TWO WATER CYLINDERS ON THE SAME LINE BY HAND WITHOUT GREAT DIFFICULTY
2792-152929-0046 HE HAD VANISHED IN THE CROWD WHO STOOD OPEN MOUTHED GAZING AFTER THE DEAD MAN OUR SPEED ON THIS CRUISE WAS REGULATED AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE
2792-152929-0047 WE MADE TWO FAIRLY PARALLEL SECTIONS WITH COMPARATIVELY REGULAR INTERVALS BETWEEN THE STATIONS AS REGULAR IN ANY CASE AS ONE CAN HOPE TO GET WITH A VESSEL LIKE THE FRAM WHICH REALLY HAS TOO LITTLE BOTH OF SAIL AREA
2792-152929-0048 AND ENGINE POWER THE NUMBER OF STATIONS WAS SIXTY IN ALL AND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY ONE SAMPLES OF WATER WERE TAKEN OF PLANKTON SPECIMENS ONE HUNDRED NINETY WERE SENT HOME THE FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THESE SPECIMENS IN NORWAY
2792-152929-0049 WILL SHOW WHETHER THE MATERIAL COLLECTED IS OF ANY VALUE AND WHETHER THE CRUISE HAS YIELDED SATISFACTORY RESULTS AS REGARDS THE WEATHER ON THE TRIP IT WAS UNIFORMLY GOOD THE WHOLE TIME
2792-152929-0050 WE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF WIND NOW AND THEN WITH SEAS AND ROLLING BUT FOR THE MOST PART THERE WAS A FRESH BREEZE IN THE SOUTH EAST TRADE WE SAILED FOR FOUR WEEKS AT A STRETCH WITHOUT USING THE ENGINE
2792-152929-0051 AT THE SAME TIME WE HAD A GOOD OPPORTUNITY OF SMARTENING UP THE SHIP WHICH SHE NEEDED BADLY ALL THE IRON WAS FREED FROM RUST AND THE WHOLE VESSEL PAINTED BOTH BELOW AND ABOVE DECK
2792-152929-0052 THE DECKS THEMSELVES WERE SMEARED WITH A MIXTURE OF OIL TAR AND TURPENTINE AFTER BEING SCOURED ALL THE RIGGING WAS EXAMINED
2792-152929-0053 NEARLY THE WHOLE SHIP WAS PAINTED AGAIN MASTS AND YARDS
2792-152929-0054 BOTH DECK HOUSES THE BOATS AND THE VARIOUS WINCHES
2792-152929-0055 OR FRESHLY PAINTED EVERYTHING HUNG IN ITS PLACE AND SUCH ORDER AND CLEANLINESS REIGNED THAT IT WAS A PLEASURE TO GO DOWN THERE THE RESULT OF ALL THIS RENOVATING AND SMARTENING UP WAS THAT WHEN WE FETCHED UP BY THE QUAY AT BUENOS AIRES
2792-152929-0056 THE FRAM LOOKED BRIGHTER THAN I SUPPOSE SHE HAS EVER DONE SINCE SHE WAS NEW
2792-152929-0057 AND ALL THE PROVISIONS RE STOWED
2792-152929-0058 A WHOLE SUIT OF SAILS WAS COMPLETELY WORN OUT ON THIS VOYAGE BUT WHAT CAN ONE EXPECT WHEN THE SHIP IS BEING WORKED EVERY SINGLE DAY WITH CLEWING UP MAKING FAST AND SETTING OF SAILS BOTH IN CALMS AND WINDS
2792-152929-0059 THIS WORK EVERY DAY REMINDED ME OF THE CORVETTE ELLIDA WHEN THE ORDER WAS ALL HANDS ALOFT AS A RULE THOUGH IT WAS ONLY CLEWING UP THE SAILS THAT HAD TO BE DONE AS WE ALWAYS HAD TO TAKE SOUNDINGS ON THE WEATHER SIDE
2792-152929-0060 SO THAT THE SOUNDING LINE SHOULD NOT FOUL THE BOTTOM OF THE VESSEL
2792-152929-0061 AND WE DID NOT LOSE MORE THAN ONE THERMOMETER IN ABOUT NINE HUNDRED SOUNDINGS
2792-152929-0062 OF SAILS ROENNE WAS OCCUPIED THE WHOLE TIME
2792-152929-0063 IN MAKING AND PATCHING SAILS
2792-152929-0064 AND ON THE APPROACHING TRIP TO THE ICE BARRIER WE SHOULD HAVE
2792-152929-0065 JUNE THIRTIETH NINETEEN ELEVEN IS A RED LETTER DAY IN THE FRAM'S HISTORY
2792-152929-0066 BRAVO FRAM IT WAS WELL DONE ESPECIALLY AFTER THE BAD CHARACTER YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN AS A SAILER AND A SEA BOAT
2792-152929-0067 AND THE FRANZ WAS CONGRATULATED BY ALL PRESENT
2792-152929-0068 ON THE EVENING OF JULY TWENTY NINTH SAINT HELENA WAS PASSED IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD SEEN THIS HISTORIC ISLAND IT WAS VERY STRANGE TO THINK THAT THE GREATEST SPIRIT OF A HUNDRED CENTURIES AS SOME AUTHOR HAS CALLED NAPOLEON
2792-152929-0069 SHOULD HAVE ENDING HIS RESTLESS LIFE ON THIS LONELY ISLAND OF THE SOUTH ATLANTIC ON AUGUST TWELFTH WHEN DAYLIGHT CAME WE SIGHTED THE LITTLE MARTIN VAZ ISLANDS AHEAD AND A LITTLE LATER SOUTH TRINIDAD
2792-152929-0070 IN NINETEEN TEN THIS ISLAND WAS PASSED ON OCTOBER SIXTEENTH WE CHECKED OUR CHRONOMETERS WHICH HOWEVER PROVED TO BE CORRECT FROM NOON TILL TWO P M WHILE WE WERE LYING STILL AND
2792-152929-0071 TAKING OUR DAILY HYDROGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS A SAILING SHIP APPEARED
2792-152929-0072 LYING CLOSE HAULED TO THE SOUTH
2792-152929-0073 AND THOSE WERE PRETTY FAR OFF
2792-152929-0074 SEPTEMBER NINETEEN TEN HAD WE BEEN TROUBLED WITH ANIMALS OR INSECTS OF ANY KIND WHATEVER BUT WHEN WE WERE IN BUENOS AIRES FOR THE FIRST TIME AT LEAST HALF A MILLION FLIES CAME ABOARD TO LOOK AT THE VESSEL I HOPED THEY WOULD GO ASHORE
2792-152929-0075 BUT IT HUNG FOR A WHOLE MONTH WITHOUT THERE BEING A SIGN OF A FISH
2792-152929-0076 ONE MORNING THE KEENEST OF OUR FISHERMEN CAME UP AS USUAL AND FELT THE LINE YES BY JOVE AT LAST THERE WAS ONE AND A BIG ONE TOO AS HE COULD HARDLY HAUL IN THE LINE BY HIMSELF
2792-152929-0077 THERE WAS A SHOUT FOR ASSISTANCE HI YOU BEGGAR COME AND LEND A HAND THERE'S A BIG FISH HELP CAME IN A SECOND
2792-152929-0078 IT'LL BE GRAND TO GET FRESH FISH FOR DINNER AT LAST THE FISH APPEARED OVER THE RAIL BUT ALAS IT WAS SEEN TO HAVE NO HEAD IT WAS AN ORDINARY STOCKFISH ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF A YARD LONG
2792-152929-0079 GOES WITHOUT SAYING THE FISHERMEN INCLUDED AS THEY TOOK IT ALL IN GOOD PART AS A FISHING BOAT THE FRAM IS ON THE WHOLE NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL
