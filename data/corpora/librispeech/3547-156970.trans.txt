3547-156970-0000 THE TENDENCY TO IDEALIZE NATIONAL HEROES
3547-156970-0001 THE GOOD IS OFT INTERRED WITH THEIR BONES WHY DO MEN AS A RULE IDEALIZE THE DEAD DOES THE PRIMITIVE TENDENCY TO ANCESTOR WORSHIP IN PART EXPLAIN THIS
3547-156970-0002 IS THE TENDENCY TO IDEALIZE THE MEN OF THE PAST BENEFICIAL IN ITS EFFECT UPON THE RACE WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECT IF ALL THE INIQUITY OF THE PAST WERE REMEMBERED
3547-156970-0003 GREEK ROMAN AND ENGLISH HISTORY ABOUNDS IN ILLUSTRATIONS
3547-156970-0004 THE NOBLEST IDEALS IN EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION ARE OFTEN THUS CONCRETELY EMBODIED IN THE CHARACTER OF SOME NATIONAL HERO COMPARE THE GREAT HEROES OF GREEK MYTHOLOGY WITH THE EARLY HEROES OF THE OLD TESTAMENT
3547-156970-0005 DO THESE DIFFERENCES CORRESPOND TO THE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GREEKS AND THE HEBREWS ARE THESE DIFFERENCES DUE TO THE PECULIAR GENIUS OF EACH RACE OR IN PART TO THE INFLUENCE EXERTED BY THE IDEALS THUS CONCRETELY PRESENTED
3547-156970-0006 UPON EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION IS IT PROBABLE THAT IN THE CHARACTER OF ABRAHAM THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF THE HEBREW RACE WAS IDEALIZED IS IT POSSIBLE THAT TEACHERS OF ISRAEL
3547-156970-0007 CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY FOSTERED THIS TENDENCY THAT THEY MIGHT IN THIS CONCRETE AND EFFECTIVE WAY IMPRESS THEIR GREAT TEACHINGS UPON THEIR RACE IF SO
3547-156970-0008 IN THE EARLY HISTORY OF MOST COUNTRIES THERE COMES A PRESSURE OF POPULATION UPON THE PRODUCTIVE POWERS OF THE LAND AS NUMBERS INCREASE IN THE HUNTING STAGE GAME BECOMES SCARCE AND MORE HUNTING GROUNDS ARE NEEDED TRIBES MIGRATE FROM SEASON TO SEASON
3547-156970-0009 AS DID THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND EVENTUALLY SOME MEMBERS OF THE TRIBE ARE LIKELY TO GO FORTH TO SEEK NEW HOMES LATER IN THE PASTORAL STAGE OF SOCIETY AS THE WEALTH OF FLOCKS AND HERDS INCREASES MORE
3547-156970-0010 PASTURAGE IS NEEDED AND SIMILAR RESULTS FOLLOW EVEN AFTER AGRICULTURE IS WELL ESTABLISHED AND COMMERCE IS WELL BEGUN AS IN ANCIENT GREECE COLONIES HAVE A LIKE ORIGIN IN THE ENGLAND OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
3547-156970-0011 MALTHUS AND HIS FOLLOWERS TAUGHT THE TENDENCY OF POPULATION TO OUTGROW THE MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE A TENDENCY OVERCOME ONLY BY RESTRAINTS ON THE GROWTH OF POPULATION OR BY NEW INVENTIONS THAT ENABLE NEW SOURCES OF SUPPLY TO BE SECURED
3547-156970-0012 OR THAT RENDER THE OLD ONES MORE EFFICIENT EMIGRATION AND PIONEERING ARE THUS A NORMAL OUTGROWTH OF A PROGRESSIVE GROWING PEOPLE IN ANY STAGE OF CIVILIZATION
3547-156970-0013 WHAT DOES THE STATEMENT ABOUT ABRAHAM'S WEALTH IN CATTLE AND SILVER AND GOLD SHOW REGARDING THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH HE CAME AND THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF GOD'S DIRECTION FOR HIS REMOVAL IMMIGRANTS AND PIONEERS ARE USUALLY THE SELF RELIANT
3547-156970-0014 AND COURAGEOUS WHO DARE TO ENDURE HARDSHIPS AND INCUR RISKS TO SECURE FOR THEIR COUNTRY AND POSTERITY THE BENEFITS OF NEW LANDS AND BROADER OPPORTUNITY THE TRIALS OF NEW AND UNTRIED EXPERIENCES AND OFTEN OF DIRE PERIL
3547-156970-0015 SO THAT THE PIONEERS IN ALL LANDS AND AGES HAVE BEEN HEROES WHOSE EXPLOITS RECOUNTED IN SONG AND STORY HAVE STIRRED THE HEARTS AND MOLDED THE FAITH OF THEIR DESCENDANTS THROUGH MANY GENERATIONS
3547-156970-0016 IN THE LIGHT OF LATER HISTORY WHAT WAS THE PROFOUND RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE TO HIS RACE AND TO THE WORLD OF THE MIGRATION REPRESENTED BY ABRAHAM
3547-156970-0017 AS HE SPEAKS TO THEM NOW THROUGH THEIR EXPERIENCES AND INNER CONSCIOUSNESS IN WHAT SENSE WAS ABRAHAM A PIONEER WAS IT FOR ABRAHAM'S MATERIAL INTEREST TO MIGRATE TO CANAAN
3547-156970-0018 THE PERMANENT VALUE AND INFLUENCE OF THE ABRAHAM NARRATIVES SCHOLARS WILL PROBABLY NEVER ABSOLUTELY AGREE REGARDING MANY PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH ABRAHAM SOME HAVE GONE SO FAR AS TO QUESTION WHETHER HE WAS AN HISTORICAL CHARACTER OR NOT
3547-156970-0019 IS THE QUESTION OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE OTHER WRITERS DECLARE IT PROBABLE THAT A TRIBAL SHEIK BY THE NAME OF ABRAHAM LED ONE OF THE MANY NOMAD TRIBES THAT SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE SECOND MILLENIUM B C
3547-156970-0020 IT IS PROBABLE THAT POPULAR TRADITION HAS PRESERVED CERTAIN FACTS REGARDING HIS LIFE AND CHARACTER IT IS EQUALLY CLEAR THAT THE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF ISRAEL'S TEACHERS HAVE EACH INTERPRETED HIS CHARACTER
3547-156970-0021 AND WORK IN KEEPING WITH THEIR DISTINCTIVE IDEALS EACH INDIVIDUAL NARRATIVE HAS AN INDEPENDENT UNITY AND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS IS FAR
3547-156970-0022 ABRAHAM ISAAC AND ISHMAEL THE SANCTITY OF CERTAIN SACRED PLACES AS FOR EXAMPLE BEERSHEBA THE ORIGIN OF IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONS AS FOR EXAMPLE CIRCUMCISION AND THE SUBSTITUTION OF ANIMAL FOR HUMAN SACRIFICE
3547-156970-0023 AND THE EXPLANATION OF STRIKING PHYSICAL PHENOMENA AS FOR EXAMPLE THE DESOLATE SHORES OF THE DEAD SEA SOME OF THESE ACCOUNTS LIKE THE TABLE OF NATIONS IN GENESIS TEN PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ITS NEIGHBORS
3547-156970-0024 THEY PRESERVE ALSO THE CHARACTERISTIC POPULAR RECORD OF THE EARLY MIGRATIONS WHICH BROUGHT THESE PEOPLES TO PALESTINE WHERE THEY CRYSTALIZED INTO THE DIFFERENT NATIONS
3547-156970-0025 THE PERMANENT AND UNIVERSAL VALUE OF THESE STORIES LIES HOWEVER IN THE GREAT MORAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY VIVIDLY AND EFFECTIVELY ILLUSTRATE THE PROPHETIC PORTRAIT OF ABRAHAM WAS AN INSPIRING EXAMPLE TO HOLD UP BEFORE A RACE
3547-156970-0026 THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ABRAHAM CAN BE TRACED IN THE IDEALS AND CHARACTER OF THE ISRAELITES THEY WERE UNQUESTIONABLY AN IMPORTANT FORCE IN DEVELOPING THE PROPHET NATION HE WAS THEREFORE PRE EMINENTLY A SPIRITUAL PIONEER
3547-156970-0027 HOW FAR DO THESE STORIES AND ESPECIALLY THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COVENANT BETWEEN JEHOVAH AND ABRAHAM EMBODY THE NATIONAL AND SPIRITUAL ASPIRATIONS OF THE RACE ARE THE ABRAHAM STORIES OF PRACTICAL INSPIRATION TO THE PRESENT GENERATION
3547-156970-0028 WHAT QUALITIES IN HIS CHARACTER ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE ALL AROUND MAN OF ANY AGE HOW FAR WOULD THE ABRAHAM OF THE PROPHETIC STORIES SUCCEED WERE HE LIVING IN AMERICA TO DAY WOULD HE BE APPRECIATED BY A MAJORITY OF OUR CITIZENS
3547-156970-0029 ARE SPIRITUAL PIONEERS OF THE TYPE OF ABRAHAM ABSOLUTELY NEEDED IN EVERY NATION AND GENERATION IF THE HUMAN RACE IS TO PROGRESS QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION ARE GOD'S PURPOSES OFTEN CONTRARY TO MAN'S DESIRES
3547-156970-0030 EVER TO MAN'S BEST INTERESTS WHAT QUALITIES MUST EVERY TRUE PIONEER POSSESS WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE BASIS OF ALL TRUE POLITENESS WHO ARE SOME OF THE GREAT PIONEERS OF EARLY AMERICAN HISTORY
3547-156970-0031 WHAT WERE THEIR CHIEF CONTRIBUTIONS TO THEIR NATION IS YOUR OWN CONSCIENTIOUS CONCEPTION OF YOUR DUTY TO BE CONSIDERED AS GOD'S COMMAND TO YOU DOES HE GIVE ANY OTHER COMMAND DOES A HIGH STAGE OF CIVILIZATION ENNOBLE CHARACTER OR TEND TO DEGRADE IT
