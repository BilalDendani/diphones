192-128345-0047 HE KNOWS THAT A WOOD SAWYER LIVING BY THE PRISON WALL IS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE DEFARGES AND HAS BEEN REHEARSED BY MADAME DEFARGE AS TO HIS HAVING SEEN HER HE NEVER MENTIONED LUCIE'S NAME MAKING SIGNS AND SIGNALS TO PRISONERS
192-128345-0048 IT IS EASY TO FORESEE THAT THE PRETENCE WILL BE THE COMMON ONE A PRISON PLOT AND THAT IT WILL INVOLVE HER LIFE AND PERHAPS HER CHILD'S AND PERHAPS HER FATHER'S FOR BOTH HAVE BEEN SEEN WITH HER AT THAT PLACE DON'T LOOK SO HORRIFIED YOU WILL SAVE THEM ALL
192-128345-0049 HEAVEN GRANT I MAY CARTON BUT HOW I AM GOING TO TELL YOU HOW IT WILL DEPEND ON YOU AND IT COULD DEPEND ON NO BETTER MAN THIS NEW DENUNCIATION WILL CERTAINLY NOT TAKE PLACE UNTIL AFTER TO MORROW
192-128345-0050 YOU KNOW IT IS A CAPITAL CRIME TO MOURN FOR OR SYMPATHISE WITH A VICTIM OF THE GUILLOTINE SHE AND HER FATHER WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY BE GUILTY OF THIS CRIME AND THIS WOMAN THE INVETERACY OF WHOSE PURSUIT CANNOT BE DESCRIBED
192-128345-0051 EARLY TO MORROW HAVE YOUR HORSES READY SO THAT THEY MAY BE IN STARTING TRIM AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON IT SHALL BE DONE HIS MANNER WAS SO FERVENT AND INSPIRING THAT MISTER LORRY CAUGHT THE FLAME AND WAS AS QUICK AS YOUTH YOU ARE A NOBLE HEART
192-128345-0052 DID I SAY WE COULD DEPEND UPON NO BETTER MAN TELL HER TO NIGHT WHAT YOU KNOW OF HER DANGER AS INVOLVING HER CHILD AND HER FATHER DWELL UPON THAT FOR SHE WOULD LAY HER OWN FAIR HEAD BESIDE HER HUSBAND'S CHEERFULLY
192-128345-0053 FOR THE SAKE OF HER CHILD AND HER FATHER PRESS UPON HER THE NECESSITY OF LEAVING PARIS WITH THEM AND YOU AT THAT HOUR TELL HER THAT IT WAS HER HUSBAND'S LAST ARRANGEMENT

192-128345-0059 THOUGH HE SAID IT WITH A GRAVE SMILE OF EARNESTNESS AND THOUGH HE EVEN PUT THE OLD MAN'S HAND TO HIS LIPS HE DID NOT PART FROM HIM THEN HE HELPED HIM SO FAR TO AROUSE THE ROCKING FIGURE BEFORE THE DYING EMBERS AS TO GET A CLOAK AND HAT PUT UPON IT
192-128345-0060 AND TO TEMPT IT FORTH TO FIND WHERE THE BENCH AND WORK WERE HIDDEN THAT IT STILL MOANINGLY BESOUGHT TO HAVE HE WALKED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT AND PROTECTED IT TO THE COURTYARD OF THE HOUSE WHERE THE AFFLICTED HEART SO HAPPY IN THE MEMORABLE TIME
192-128345-0061 WHEN HE HAD REVEALED HIS OWN DESOLATE HEART TO IT OUTWATCHED THE AWFUL NIGHT HE ENTERED THE COURTYARD AND REMAINED THERE FOR A FEW MOMENTS ALONE LOOKING UP AT THE LIGHT IN THE WINDOW OF HER ROOM BEFORE HE WENT AWAY HE BREATHED A BLESSING TOWARDS IT
