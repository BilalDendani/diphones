3503-127082-0000 SHOULD PERMIT THEM TO ATTEND TO THE CALLS OF THEIR HALF SATIATED APPETITE WE HAVE TO LOOK IN UPON THE YET MORE SEVERE IMPRISONMENT OF ISAAC OF YORK THE POOR JEW HAD BEEN HASTILY THRUST INTO A DUNGEON VAULT OF THE CASTLE
3503-127082-0001 THE FLOOR OF WHICH WAS DEEP BENEATH THE LEVEL OF THE GROUND AND VERY DAMP BEING LOWER THAN EVEN THE MOAT ITSELF THE ONLY LIGHT WAS RECEIVED THROUGH ONE OR TWO LOOP HOLES FAR ABOVE THE REACH OF THE CAPTIVE'S HAND
3503-127082-0002 THESE APERTURES ADMITTED EVEN AT MID DAY ONLY A DIM AND UNCERTAIN LIGHT WHICH WAS CHANGED FOR UTTER DARKNESS LONG BEFORE THE REST OF THE CASTLE HAD LOST THE BLESSING OF DAY CHAINS AND SHACKLES
3503-127082-0003 WHICH HAD BEEN THE PORTION OF FORMER CAPTIVES FROM WHOM ACTIVE EXERTIONS TO ESCAPE HAD BEEN APPREHENDED HUNG RUSTED AND EMPTY ON THE WALLS OF THE PRISON AND IN THE RINGS OF ONE OF THOSE SETS OF FETTERS
3503-127082-0004 THERE REMAINED TWO MOULDERING BONES WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ONCE THOSE OF THE HUMAN LEG AS IF SOME PRISONER HAD BEEN LEFT NOT ONLY TO PERISH THERE BUT TO BE CONSUMED TO A SKELETON
3503-127082-0005 AT ONE END OF THIS GHASTLY APARTMENT WAS A LARGE FIRE GRATE OVER THE TOP OF WHICH WERE STRETCHED SOME TRANSVERSE IRON BARS HALF DEVOURED WITH RUST
3503-127082-0006 THE WHOLE APPEARANCE OF THE DUNGEON MIGHT HAVE APPALLED A STOUTER HEART THAN THAT OF ISAAC WHO NEVERTHELESS WAS MORE COMPOSED UNDER THE IMMINENT PRESSURE OF DANGER THAN HE HAD SEEMED TO BE WHILE AFFECTED BY TERRORS
3503-127082-0007 OF WHICH THE CAUSE WAS AS YET REMOTE AND CONTINGENT THE LOVERS OF THE CHASE SAY THAT THE HARE FEELS MORE AGONY DURING THE PURSUIT OF THE GREYHOUNDS
3503-127082-0008 BY THE VERY FREQUENCY OF THEIR FEAR ON ALL OCCASIONS HAD THEIR MINDS IN SOME DEGREE PREPARED FOR EVERY EFFORT OF TYRANNY WHICH COULD BE PRACTISED UPON THEM SO THAT NO AGGRESSION WHEN IT HAD TAKEN PLACE COULD BRING WITH IT THAT SURPRISE
3503-127082-0009 WHICH IS THE MOST DISABLING QUALITY OF TERROR NEITHER WAS IT THE FIRST TIME THAT ISAAC HAD BEEN PLACED IN CIRCUMSTANCES SO DANGEROUS HE HAD THEREFORE EXPERIENCE TO GUIDE HIM AS WELL AS HOPE THAT HE MIGHT AGAIN
3503-127082-0010 AS FORMERLY BE DELIVERED AS A PREY FROM THE FOWLER ABOVE ALL HE HAD UPON HIS SIDE THE UNYIELDING OBSTINACY OF HIS NATION AND THAT UNBENDING RESOLUTION WITH WHICH ISRAELITES HAVE BEEN FREQUENTLY KNOWN TO SUBMIT TO THE UTTERMOST EVILS
3503-127082-0011 WHICH POWER AND VIOLENCE CAN INFLICT UPON THEM RATHER THAN GRATIFY THEIR OPPRESSORS BY GRANTING THEIR DEMANDS IN THIS HUMOUR OF PASSIVE RESISTANCE
3503-127082-0012 AND WITH HIS GARMENT COLLECTED BENEATH HIM TO KEEP HIS LIMBS FROM THE WET PAVEMENT ISAAC SAT IN A CORNER OF HIS DUNGEON WHERE HIS FOLDED HANDS HIS DISHEVELLED HAIR AND BEARD HIS FURRED CLOAK AND HIGH CAP
3503-127082-0013 WOULD HAVE AFFORDED A STUDY FOR REMBRANDT HAD THAT CELEBRATED PAINTER EXISTED AT THE PERIOD THE JEW REMAINED WITHOUT ALTERING HIS POSITION FOR NEARLY THREE HOURS AT THE EXPIRY OF WHICH
3503-127082-0014 STEPS WERE HEARD ON THE DUNGEON STAIR THE BOLTS SCREAMED AS THEY WERE WITHDRAWN THE HINGES CREAKED AS THE WICKET OPENED AND REGINALD FRONT DE BOEUF
3503-127082-0015 ENTERED THE PRISON FRONT DE BOEUF A TALL AND STRONG MAN WHOSE LIFE HAD BEEN SPENT IN PUBLIC WAR OR IN PRIVATE FEUDS AND BROILS AND WHO HAD HESITATED AT NO MEANS OF EXTENDING HIS FEUDAL POWER
3503-127082-0016 HAD FEATURES CORRESPONDING TO HIS CHARACTER AND WHICH STRONGLY EXPRESSED THE FIERCER AND MORE MALIGNANT PASSIONS OF THE MIND THE SCARS WITH WHICH HIS VISAGE WAS SEAMED WOULD ON FEATURES OF A DIFFERENT CAST
3503-127082-0017 HAVE EXCITED THE SYMPATHY AND VENERATION DUE TO THE MARKS OF HONOURABLE VALOUR BUT IN THE PECULIAR CASE OF FRONT DE BOEUF THEY ONLY ADDED TO THE FEROCITY OF HIS COUNTENANCE AND TO THE DREAD WHICH HIS PRESENCE INSPIRED
3503-127082-0018 THIS FORMIDABLE BARON WAS CLAD IN A LEATHERN DOUBLET FITTED CLOSE TO HIS BODY WHICH WAS FRAYED AND SOILED WITH THE STAINS OF HIS ARMOUR HE HAD NO WEAPON EXCEPTING A PONIARD AT HIS BELT
3503-127082-0019 WHICH SERVED TO COUNTERBALANCE THE WEIGHT OF THE BUNCH OF RUSTY KEYS THAT HUNG AT HIS RIGHT SIDE THE BLACK SLAVES WHO ATTENDED FRONT DE BOEUF WERE STRIPPED OF THEIR GORGEOUS APPAREL
3503-127082-0020 AND ATTIRED IN JERKINS AND TROWSERS OF COARSE LINEN THEIR SLEEVES BEING TUCKED UP ABOVE THE ELBOW LIKE THOSE OF BUTCHERS WHEN ABOUT TO EXERCISE THEIR FUNCTION IN THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE EACH HAD IN HIS HAND A SMALL PANNIER
3503-127082-0021 AND WHEN THEY ENTERED THE DUNGEON THEY STOPT AT THE DOOR UNTIL FRONT DE BOEUF HIMSELF CAREFULLY LOCKED AND DOUBLE LOCKED IT HAVING TAKEN THIS PRECAUTION HE ADVANCED SLOWLY UP THE APARTMENT TOWARDS THE JEW
3503-127082-0022 UPON WHOM HE KEPT HIS EYE FIXED AS IF HE WISHED TO PARALYZE HIM WITH HIS GLANCE AS SOME ANIMALS ARE SAID TO FASCINATE THEIR PREY IT SEEMED INDEED AS IF THE SULLEN AND MALIGNANT EYE OF FRONT DE BOEUF
3503-127082-0023 POSSESSED SOME PORTION OF THAT SUPPOSED POWER OVER HIS UNFORTUNATE PRISONER THE JEW SAT WITH HIS MOUTH AGAPE AND HIS EYES FIXED ON THE SAVAGE BARON WITH SUCH EARNESTNESS OF TERROR
3503-127082-0024 THAT HIS FRAME SEEMED LITERALLY TO SHRINK TOGETHER AND TO DIMINISH IN SIZE WHILE ENCOUNTERING THE FIERCE NORMAN'S FIXED AND BALEFUL GAZE
3503-127082-0025 THE UNHAPPY ISAAC WAS DEPRIVED NOT ONLY OF THE POWER OF RISING TO MAKE THE OBEISANCE WHICH HIS TERROR DICTATED BUT HE COULD NOT EVEN DOFF HIS CAP OR UTTER ANY WORD OF SUPPLICATION
3503-127082-0026 SO STRONGLY WAS HE AGITATED BY THE CONVICTION THAT TORTURES AND DEATH WERE IMPENDING OVER HIM ON THE OTHER HAND THE STATELY FORM OF THE NORMAN APPEARED TO DILATE IN MAGNITUDE LIKE THAT OF THE EAGLE
3503-127082-0027 WHICH RUFFLES UP ITS PLUMAGE WHEN ABOUT TO POUNCE ON ITS DEFENCELESS PREY HE PAUSED WITHIN THREE STEPS OF THE CORNER IN WHICH THE UNFORTUNATE JEW HAD NOW AS IT WERE COILED HIMSELF UP INTO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE SPACE
3503-127082-0028 AND MADE A SIGN FOR ONE OF THE SLAVES TO APPROACH THE BLACK SATELLITE CAME FORWARD ACCORDINGLY AND PRODUCING FROM HIS BASKET A LARGE PAIR OF SCALES AND SEVERAL WEIGHTS HE LAID THEM AT THE FEET OF FRONT DE BOEUF
3503-127082-0029 AND AGAIN RETIRED TO THE RESPECTFUL DISTANCE AT WHICH HIS COMPANION HAD ALREADY TAKEN HIS STATION THE MOTIONS OF THESE MEN WERE SLOW AND SOLEMN AS IF THERE IMPENDED OVER THEIR SOULS
3503-127082-0030 SOME PRECONCEPTION OF HORROR AND OF CRUELTY FRONT DE BOEUF HIMSELF OPENED THE SCENE BY THUS ADDRESSING HIS ILL FATED CAPTIVE MOST ACCURSED DOG OF AN ACCURSED RACE
3503-127082-0031 HE SAID AWAKING WITH HIS DEEP AND SULLEN VOICE THE SULLEN ECHOES OF HIS DUNGEON VAULT SEEST THOU THESE SCALES THE UNHAPPY JEW RETURNED A FEEBLE AFFIRMATIVE
3503-127082-0032 SAID THE RELENTLESS BARON A THOUSAND SILVER POUNDS AFTER THE JUST MEASURE AND WEIGHT OF THE TOWER OF LONDON HOLY ABRAHAM RETURNED THE JEW FINDING VOICE THROUGH THE VERY EXTREMITY OF HIS DANGER
3503-127082-0033 HEARD MAN EVER SUCH A DEMAND WHO EVER HEARD EVEN IN A MINSTREL'S TALE OF SUCH A SUM AS A THOUSAND POUNDS OF SILVER WHAT HUMAN SIGHT WAS EVER BLESSED WITH THE VISION OF SUCH A MASS OF TREASURE NOT WITHIN THE WALLS OF YORK
3503-127082-0034 RANSACK MY HOUSE AND THAT OF ALL MY TRIBE WILT THOU FIND THE TITHE OF THAT HUGE SUM OF SILVER THAT THOU SPEAKEST OF I AM REASONABLE
3503-127082-0035 AT THE RATE OF A MARK OF GOLD FOR EACH SIX POUNDS OF SILVER THOU SHALT FREE THY UNBELIEVING CARCASS FROM SUCH PUNISHMENT AS THY HEART HAS NEVER EVEN CONCEIVED HAVE MERCY ON ME NOBLE KNIGHT
3503-127082-0036 EXCLAIMED ISAAC I AM OLD AND POOR AND HELPLESS IT WERE UNWORTHY TO TRIUMPH OVER ME IT IS A POOR DEED TO CRUSH A WORM OLD THOU MAYST BE REPLIED THE KNIGHT
3503-127082-0037 FEEBLE THOU MAYST BE FOR WHEN HAD A JEW EITHER HEART OR HAND
3503-127082-0038 I SWEAR TO YOU NOBLE KNIGHT SAID THE JEW BY ALL WHICH I BELIEVE AND BY ALL WHICH WE BELIEVE IN COMMON PERJURE NOT THYSELF SAID THE NORMAN INTERRUPTING HIM AND LET NOT THINE OBSTINACY SEAL THY DOOM
3503-127082-0039 THINK NOT I SPEAK TO THEE ONLY TO EXCITE THY TERROR AND PRACTISE ON THE BASE COWARDICE THOU HAST DERIVED FROM THY TRIBE I SWEAR TO THEE BY THAT WHICH THOU DOST NOT BELIEVE BY THE GOSPEL WHICH OUR CHURCH TEACHES
3503-127082-0040 AND BY THE KEYS WHICH ARE GIVEN HER TO BIND AND TO LOOSE THAT MY PURPOSE IS DEEP AND PEREMPTORY THIS DUNGEON IS NO PLACE FOR TRIFLING PRISONERS TEN THOUSAND TIMES MORE DISTINGUISHED THAN THOU HAVE DIED WITHIN THESE WALLS
3503-127082-0041 AND THEIR FATE HATH NEVER BEEN KNOWN BUT FOR THEE IS RESERVED A LONG AND LINGERING DEATH TO WHICH THEIRS WERE LUXURY HE AGAIN MADE A SIGNAL FOR THE SLAVES TO APPROACH AND SPOKE TO THEM APART IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE
3503-127082-0042 WHERE PERHAPS HE HAD LEARNT HIS LESSON OF CRUELTY
