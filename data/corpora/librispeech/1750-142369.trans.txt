1750-142369-0000 THE NEXT SUNDAY ADAM JOINED THE POYSERS ON THEIR WAY OUT OF CHURCH HOPING FOR AN INVITATION TO GO HOME WITH THEM
1750-142369-0001 COME YOU'LL GO ON WITH US ADAM MISTER POYSER SAID WHEN THEY REACHED THE TURNING AND AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN THE FIELDS ADAM VENTURED TO OFFER HIS ARM TO HETTY THE CHILDREN SOON GAVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY OF LINGERING BEHIND A LITTLE AND THEN ADAM SAID
1750-142369-0002 WILL YOU CONTRIVE FOR ME TO WALK OUT IN THE GARDEN A BIT WITH YOU THIS EVENING IF IT KEEPS FINE HETTY I'VE SOMETHING PARTIC'LAR TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
1750-142369-0003 SHE WAS REALLY AS ANXIOUS AS ADAM WAS THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE SOME PRIVATE TALK WITH HIM SHE WONDERED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF HER AND ARTHUR HE MUST HAVE SEEN THEM KISSING SHE KNEW BUT SHE HAD NO CONCEPTION OF THE SCENE THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN ARTHUR AND ADAM
1750-142369-0004 FOR SHE HAD TREMBLED WHEN SHE FOUND HE WAS GOING HOME WITH THEM LEST HE SHOULD MEAN TO TELL
1750-142369-0005 SHE SHOULD LEARN WHAT HE THOUGHT AND WHAT HE MEANT TO DO SHE FELT A CERTAIN CONFIDENCE THAT SHE COULD PERSUADE HIM NOT TO DO ANYTHING SHE DID NOT WANT HIM TO DO SHE COULD PERHAPS EVEN MAKE HIM BELIEVE THAT SHE DIDN'T CARE FOR ARTHUR
1750-142369-0006 AND AS LONG AS ADAM THOUGHT THERE WAS ANY HOPE OF HER HAVING HIM HE WOULD DO JUST WHAT SHE LIKED SHE KNEW BESIDES SHE MUST GO ON SEEMING TO ENCOURAGE ADAM LEST HER UNCLE AND AUNT SHOULD BE ANGRY AND SUSPECT HER OF HAVING SOME SECRET LOVER
1750-142369-0007 HETTY'S LITTLE BRAIN WAS BUSY WITH THIS COMBINATION AS SHE HUNG ON ADAM'S ARM AND SAID YES OR NO TO SOME SLIGHT OBSERVATIONS OF HIS
1750-142369-0008 HE WOULD NEVERTHELESS BE GLAD OF A LITTLE REASONABLE TALK ABOUT BUSINESS THE WHILE AND FOR HIS OWN PART HE WAS CURIOUS TO HEAR THE MOST RECENT NEWS ABOUT THE CHASE FARM SO THROUGH THE REST OF THE WALK HE CLAIMED ADAM'S CONVERSATION FOR HIMSELF
1750-142369-0009 WHO APPLIES HER REFINED INTELLECT TO THE PROBLEM OF COMMITTING INDISCRETIONS WITHOUT COMPROMISING HERSELF PERHAPS THE RESEMBLANCE WAS NOT MUCH THE LESS BECAUSE HETTY FELT VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE WHILE THE PARTING WITH ARTHUR WAS A DOUBLE PAIN TO HER
1750-142369-0010 SHE CLUNG TO THE COMFORTING HOPEFUL WORDS ARTHUR HAD UTTERED IN THEIR LAST MEETING
1750-142369-0011 BUT THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE FUTURE THE POSSIBILITIES TO WHICH SHE COULD GIVE NO SHAPE BEGAN TO PRESS UPON HER LIKE THE INVISIBLE WEIGHT OF AIR SHE WAS ALONE ON HER LITTLE ISLAND OF DREAMS AND ALL AROUND HER WAS THE DARK UNKNOWN WATER WHERE ARTHUR WAS GONE
1750-142369-0012 SHE COULD GATHER NO ELATION OF SPIRITS NOW BY LOOKING FORWARD BUT ONLY BY LOOKING BACKWARD TO BUILD CONFIDENCE ON PAST WORDS AND CARESSES BUT OCCASIONALLY SINCE THURSDAY EVENING HER DIM ANXIETIES HAD BEEN ALMOST LOST BEHIND THE MORE DEFINITE FEAR
1750-142369-0013 THAT ADAM MIGHT BETRAY WHAT HE KNEW TO HER UNCLE AND AUNT AND HIS SUDDEN PROPOSITION TO TALK WITH HER ALONE HAD SET HER THOUGHTS TO WORK IN A NEW WAY
1750-142369-0014 AND AFTER TEA WHEN THE BOYS WERE GOING INTO THE GARDEN AND TOTTY BEGGED TO GO WITH THEM
1750-142369-0015 WITH AND TOTTY WAS WATCHING THEM WITH A PUPPYLIKE AIR OF CONTEMPLATION IT WAS BUT A SHORT TIME HARDLY TWO MONTHS SINCE ADAM HAD HAD HIS MIND FILLED WITH DELICIOUS HOPES AS HE STOOD BY HETTY'S SIDE IN THIS GARDEN
1750-142369-0016 THE REMEMBRANCE OF THAT SCENE HAD OFTEN BEEN WITH HIM SINCE THURSDAY EVENING
1750-142369-0017 THE RED BUNCHES HETTY'S SWEET BLUSH IT CAME IMPORTUNATELY NOW ON THIS SAD EVENING WITH THE LOW HANGING CLOUDS BUT HE TRIED TO SUPPRESS IT LEST SOME EMOTION SHOULD IMPEL HIM TO SAY MORE THAN WAS NEEDFUL FOR HETTY'S SAKE
1750-142369-0018 AFTER WHAT I SAW ON THURSDAY NIGHT HETTY HE BEGAN YOU WON'T THINK ME MAKING TOO FREE IN WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY IF YOU WAS BEING COURTED BY ANY MAN AS UD MAKE YOU HIS WIFE AND I'D KNOWN YOU WAS FOND OF HIM AND MEANT TO HAVE HIM
1750-142369-0019 BUT WHEN I SEE YOU'RE BEING MADE LOVE TO BY A GENTLEMAN AS CAN NEVER MARRY YOU AND DOESNA THINK O MARRYING YOU I FEEL BOUND T INTERFERE FOR YOU I CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT IT TO THEM AS ARE THE PLACE O YOUR PARENTS FOR THAT MIGHT BRING WORSE TROUBLE THAN'S NEEDFUL
1750-142369-0020 ADAM'S WORDS RELIEVED ONE OF HETTY'S FEARS BUT THEY ALSO CARRIED A MEANING WHICH SICKENED HER WITH A STRENGTHENED FOREBODING SHE WAS PALE AND TREMBLING AND YET SHE WOULD HAVE ANGRILY CONTRADICTED ADAM IF SHE HAD DARED TO BETRAY HER FEELINGS
1750-142369-0021 BUT SHE WAS SILENT YOU'RE SO YOUNG YOU KNOW HETTY HE WENT ON ALMOST TENDERLY
1750-142369-0022 ADAM PAUSED AND LOOKED AT HETTY WHO WAS PLUCKING THE LEAVES FROM THE FILBERT TREES AND TEARING THEM UP IN HER HAND HER LITTLE PLANS AND PRECONCERTED SPEECHES HAD ALL FORSAKEN HER LIKE AN ILL LEARNT LESSON UNDER THE TERRIBLE AGITATION PRODUCED BY ADAM'S WORDS
1750-142369-0023 THERE WAS A CRUEL FORCE IN THEIR CALM CERTAINTY WHICH THREATENED TO GRAPPLE AND CRUSH HER FLIMSY HOPES AND FANCIES
1750-142369-0024 BUT THE DETERMINATION TO CONCEAL WHAT SHE FELT STILL GOVERNED HER IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A BLIND PROMPTING NOW FOR SHE WAS UNABLE TO CALCULATE THE EFFECT OF HER WORDS YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO SAY AS I LOVE HIM SHE SAID FAINTLY BUT IMPETUOUSLY PLUCKING ANOTHER ROUGH LEAF AND TEARING IT UP
1750-142369-0025 SHE WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL IN HER PALENESS AND AGITATION WITH HER DARK CHILDISH EYES DILATED AND HER BREATH SHORTER THAN USUAL ADAM'S HEART YEARNED OVER HER AS HE LOOKED AT HER
1750-142369-0026 BUT COMFORT HER AND SOOTHE HER AND SAVE HER FROM THIS PAIN IF HE HAD BUT SOME SORT OF STRENGTH THAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO RESCUE HER POOR TROUBLED MIND AS HE WOULD HAVE RESCUED HER BODY IN THE FACE OF ALL DANGER
1750-142369-0027 I DOUBT IT MUST BE SO HETTY HE SAID TENDERLY FOR I CANNA BELIEVE YOU'D LET ANY MAN KISS YOU BY YOURSELVES
1750-142369-0028 WHEN HE KNEW HE COULD NEVER MAKE YOU THE RIGHT AMENDS HE'S BEEN TRIFLING WITH YOU AND MAKING A PLAYTHING OF YOU AND CARING NOTHING ABOUT YOU AS A MAN OUGHT TO CARE YES HE DOES CARE FOR ME I KNOW BETTER NOR YOU HETTY BURST OUT
1750-142369-0029 EVERYTHING WAS FORGOTTEN BUT THE PAIN AND ANGER SHE FELT AT ADAM'S WORDS NAY HETTY SAID ADAM IF HE'D CARED FOR YOU RIGHTLY HE'D NEVER HA BEHAVED SO HE TOLD ME HIMSELF HE MEANT NOTHING BY HIS KISSING AND PRESENTS
1750-142369-0030 BUT I KNOW BETTER NOR THAT I CAN'T HELP THINKING AS YOU'VE BEEN TRUSTING TO HIS LOVING YOU WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY YOU FOR ALL HE'S A GENTLEMAN
1750-142369-0031 FOR FEAR YOU SHOULD BE DECEIVING YOURSELF IT'S NEVER ENTERED HIS HEAD THE THOUGHT O MARRYING YOU HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW DURST YOU SAY SO SAID HETTY PAUSING IN HER WALK AND TREMBLING THE TERRIBLE DECISION OF ADAM'S TONE SHOOK HER WITH FEAR
1750-142369-0032 PERHAPS YOU CAN'T BELIEVE ME HETTY BECAUSE YOU THINK TOO WELL OF HIM BECAUSE YOU THINK HE LOVES YOU BETTER THAN HE DOES BUT I'VE GOT A LETTER MY POCKET AS HE WROTE HIMSELF FOR ME TO GIVE YOU I'VE NOT READ THE LETTER BUT HE SAYS HE'S TOLD YOU THE TRUTH IN IT
1750-142369-0033 HETTY SAID NOTHING SHE FELT A REVIVAL OF HOPE AT THE MENTION OF A LETTER WHICH ADAM HAD NOT READ THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT IN IT FROM WHAT HE THOUGHT ADAM TOOK OUT THE LETTER BUT HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND STILL WHILE HE SAID IN A TONE OF TENDER ENTREATY
1750-142369-0034 AND THINK THERE'S NOBODY BUT ME KNOWS ABOUT THIS AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU AS IF I WAS YOUR BROTHER YOU'RE THE SAME AS EVER TO ME FOR I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'VE DONE ANY WRONG KNOWINGLY HETTY HAD LAID HER HAND ON THE LETTER BUT ADAM DID NOT LOOSE IT TILL HE HAD DONE SPEAKING
1750-142369-0035 SHE TOOK NO NOTICE OF WHAT HE SAID SHE HAD NOT LISTENED
1750-142369-0036 YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT NOT TO READ IT JUST YET SAID ADAM READ IT WHEN YOU'RE BY YOURSELF BUT STAY OUT A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND LET US CALL THE CHILDREN YOU LOOK SO WHITE AND ILL YOUR AUNT MAY TAKE NOTICE OF IT HETTY HEARD THE WARNING
1750-142369-0037 IT RECALLED TO HER THE NECESSITY OF RALLYING HER NATIVE POWERS OF CONCEALMENT WHICH HAD HALF GIVEN WAY UNDER THE SHOCK OF ADAM'S WORDS AND SHE HAD THE LETTER IN HER POCKET SHE WAS SURE THERE WAS COMFORT IN THAT LETTER IN SPITE OF ADAM
1750-142369-0038 BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO THROW AWAY AN UNRIPE APPLE THAT SHE HAD SET HER SMALL TEETH IN HEGH TOTTY SAID ADAM COME AND RIDE ON MY SHOULDER EVER SO HIGH YOU'LL TOUCH THE TOPS O THE TREES
