2262-141717-0000 WHEN ZADIG HAD TRAVELLED SOME FEW LEAGUES FROM ARBOGAD'S CASTLE HE FOUND HIMSELF ARRIV'D AT THE BANKS OF A LITTLE RIVER INCESSANTLY DEPLORING AS HE WENT ALONG HIS UNHAPPY FATE AND LOOKING UPON HIMSELF AS THE VERY PICTURE OF ILL LUCK
2262-141717-0001 RECLIN'D ON A VERDANT BANK BY THE RIVER SIDE TREMBLING SCARCE ABLE TO HOLD HIS NET IN HIS HAND WHICH HE SEEM'D BUT LITTLE TO REGARD AND WITH UPLIFT EYES IMPLORING HEAVEN'S ASSISTANCE
2262-141717-0002 IT IS VERY WELL KNOWN WAS EVER SO NOTED FOR SELLING CREAM CHEESES AS MYSELF AND YET I AM RUIN'D TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES NO MAN OF MY PROFESSION EVER HAD A HANDSOMER MORE COMPLEAT HOUSEWIFE THAN MY DAME WAS
2262-141717-0003 BUT I HAVE BEEN TREACHEROUSLY DEPRIV'D OF HER I HAD STILL LEFT A POOR PITIFUL COTTAGE BUT THAT I SAW PLUNDER'D AND DESTROY'D
2262-141717-0004 AND NOT ONE SINGLE FISH HAVE I CAUGHT THOU UNFORTUNATE NET
2262-141717-0005 NO SOONER WERE THE WORDS OUT OF HIS MOUTH BUT HE STARTED UP AND RAN TO THE RIVER SIDE LIKE ONE THAT WAS RESOLUTELY BENT TO PLUNGE IN AND GET RID OF A MISERABLE LIFE AT ONCE IS IT POSSIBLE SAID ZADIG
2262-141717-0006 IS THERE THEN THE MAN IN BEING MORE WRETCHED THAN MYSELF HIS BENEVOLENCE AND GOOD WILL TO SAVE THE POOR MAN'S LIFE WAS AS QUICK AS THE REFLECTION HE HAD JUST MADE HE RAN TO HIS ASSISTANCE HE LAID HOLD OF HIM AND ASK'D HIM
2262-141717-0007 THE CAUSE OF HIS RASH INTENTION TIS AN OLD SAYING THAT A PERSON IS LESS UNHAPPY WHEN HE SEES HIMSELF NOT SINGULAR IN MISFORTUNE BUT IF WE WILL CREDIT ZOROASTER THIS IS NOT FROM A PRINCIPLE OF MALIGNITY
2262-141717-0008 BUT THE EFFECT OF A FATAL NECESSITY HE WAS ATTRACTED AS IT WERE TO ANY PERSON IN DISTRESS AS BEING ONE IN THE SAME UNHAPPY CIRCUMSTANCES THE TRANSPORT OF A HAPPY MAN WOULD BE A KIND OF INSULT
2262-141717-0009 BUT TWO PERSONS IN BAD CIRCUMSTANCES ARE LIKE TWO WEAK SHRUBS WHICH BY PROPPING UP EACH OTHER ARE FENC'D AGAINST A STORM WHY ARE YOU THUS CAST DOWN SAID ZADIG TO THE FISHERMAN
2262-141717-0010 NEVER SINK MAN UNDER THE WEIGHT OF YOUR BURDEN I CAN'T HELP IT SAID THE POOR FISHERMAN I HAVE NOT THE LEAST PROSPECT OF REDRESS
2262-141717-0011 MADE THE BEST CREAM CHEESES THAT WERE EVER EATEN IN THE PERSIAN EMPIRE
2262-141717-0012 AND THE FAMOUS PRIME MINISTER ZADIG WERE VERY FOND OF THEM I SERV'D THE COURT WITH ABOUT SIX HUNDRED OF THEM I WENT THE OTHER DAY IN HOPES OF BEING PAID BUT BEFORE I HAD WELL GOT INTO THE SUBURBS OF BABYLON
2262-141717-0013 I WAS INFORM'D THAT NOT ONLY THE QUEEN BUT ZADIG TOO HAD PRIVATELY LEFT THE COURT WHEREUPON I RAN DIRECTLY TO ZADIG'S HOUSE THO I NEVER SAT EYE ON THE MAN IN ALL MY LIFE
2262-141717-0014 DESTERHAM PLUNDERING BY VIRTUE OF HIS MAJESTY'S MANDATE ALL HIS EFFECTS IN THE MOST LOYAL MANNER FROM THENCE I MADE THE BEST OF MY WAY TO THE QUEEN'S KITCHIN
2262-141717-0015 AND HIS INFERIOR OFFICERS ONE OF THEM TOLD ME SHE WAS DEAD
2262-141717-0016 A THIRD INDEED SAID THAT SHE HAD MADE HER ESCAPE BY FLIGHT ALL IN GENERAL HOWEVER ASSUR'D ME FOR MY COMFORT THAT MY CHEESES WOULD NEVER BE PAID FOR FROM THENCE I WENT WITH MY WIFE IN MY HAND TO LORD ORCAN'S
2262-141717-0017 WHO WAS ANOTHER OF MY COURT CUSTOMERS
2262-141717-0018 THE FAVOUR I CONFESS WAS READILY GRANTED TO MY WIFE BUT AS FOR MY OWN PART I WAS ABSOLUTELY REJECTED SHE WAS FAIRER SIR THAN THE FAIREST CHEESE I EVER SOLD
2262-141717-0019 FROM WHENCE I DATE ALL MY MISFORTUNES AND THE RED THAT ADORN'D HER BLUSHING CHEEKS WAS TEN TIMES MORE LIVELY THAN ANY TYRIAN SCARLET AND BETWEEN YOU AND I SIR THAT WAS THE MAIN CAUSE OF MY WIFE'S RECEPTION AND MY DISGRACE
2262-141717-0020 WHEREUPON I WROTE A DOLEFUL LETTER TO MY WIFE IN ALL THE AGONIES OF ONE IN THE DEEPEST DESPAIR TIS VERY WELL
2262-141717-0021 I HAVE SOME LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MAN I HAVE HEARD SAY NO ONE SELLS BETTER CREAM CHEESES THAN HE DOES DESIRE HIM NEXT TIME HE COMES TO BRING A SMALL PARCEL WITH HIM AND LET HIM KNOW I'LL TAKE CARE HE SHALL BE PUNCTUALLY PAID
2262-141717-0022 IN THE HEIGHT OF MY MISFORTUNES I DETERMIN'D TO SEEK REDRESS IN A COURT OF EQUITY I HAD BUT SIX OUNCES OF GOLD LEFT TWO WHEREOF WENT FOR A FEE TO MY COUNSELLOR
2262-141717-0023 THE OTHER TWO TO THE JUDGE'S CLERK NOTWITHSTANDING WHAT I HAD DONE MY CAUSE WAS NOT SO MUCH AS COMMENC'D AND I HAD ALREADY DISBURS'D MORE MONEY THAN ALL MY CHEESES AND MY WIFE WITH THEM WERE WORTH
2262-141717-0024 I RETURN'D THEREFORE TO MY NATIVE HABITATION
2262-141717-0025 MY LITTLE COT WITH THE APPURTENANCES
2262-141717-0026 BUT AS THE PURCHASERS FOUND I WAS NECESSITOUS AND DROVE TO MY LAST SHIFTS THE FIRST WHOM I APPLY'D TO OFFER'D ME THIRTY OUNCES THE SECOND TWENTY AND THE THIRD BUT TEN
2262-141717-0027 THE PRINCE OF HYRCANIA CAME TO BABYLON AND SWEPT ALL BEFORE HIM MY LITTLE COTTAGE WITH ALL ITS FURNITURE WAS FIRST PLUNDER'D OF ALL THAT WAS VALUABLE AND AT LAST REDUC'D TO ASHES HAVING THUS LOST MY MONEY
2262-141717-0028 MY WIFE AND MY HOUSE I WITHDREW TO THIS DESART WHERE YOU SEE ME
2262-141717-0029 BUT THE FISH AS WELL AS ALL MANKIND DESERT ME I SCARCE CATCH ONE IN A DAY I AM HALF STARV'D AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR YOUR UNEXPECTED BENEVOLENCE AND GENEROSITY I HAD BEEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER BEFORE THIS

2262-141717-0031 BUT THIS I KNOW TO MY SORROW THAT NEITHER THE QUEEN NOR ZADIG EVER PAID ME THE LEAST CONSIDERATION IN THE WORLD FOR MY CREAM CHEESES THAT MY DEAR SPOUSE IS TAKEN FROM ME AND THAT I AM DROVE TO THE VERY BRINK OF DESPAIR
2262-141717-0032 I AM VERILY PERSUADED SAID ZADIG THAT YOU WILL NOT LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY
2262-141717-0033 THEY SAY HE IS VERY HONEST AND THAT IF EVER HE RETURNS TO BABYLON AS TIS TO BE HOP'D HE WILL HE'LL DISCHARGE HIS DEBTS WITH INTEREST LIKE A MAN OF HONOUR BUT AS FOR YOUR WIFE WHO APPEARS TO ME TO BE NO BETTER THAN A WAG TAIL
2262-141717-0034 NEVER TAKE THE TROUBLE IF YOU'LL TAKE MY ADVICE TO HUNT AFTER HER ANY MORE BE RUL'D AND MAKE THE BEST OF YOUR WAY TO BABYLON I SHALL BE THERE BEFORE YOU AS I SHALL RIDE AND YOU WILL BE ON FOOT
2262-141717-0035 TELL HIM YOU MET HIS FRIEND UPON THE ROAD AND STAY THERE STILL I COME OBSERVE MY ORDERS
2262-141717-0036 YOU HAVE MADE ME TIS TRUE AN INSTRUMENT OF COMFORT TO THIS POOR MAN BUT WHAT FRIEND WILL YOU RAISE FOR ME TO ALLEVIATE MY SORROWS HAVING UTTER'D THIS SHORT EXPOSTULATION HE GAVE THE DISTREST FISHERMAN ONE FULL MOIETY
2262-141717-0037 OF ALL THE MONEY HE BROUGHT WITH HIM OUT OF ARABIA THE FISHERMAN THUNDER STRUCK AND TRANSPORTED WITH JOY AT SO UNEXPECTED A BENEFACTION KISS'D THE FEET OF CADOR'S FRIEND AND CRIED OUT
2262-141717-0038 SURE YOU ARE A MESSENGER OF HEAVEN SENT DOWN TO BE MY SAVIOUR IN THE MEAN TIME ZADIG EVERY NOW AND THEN ASK'D HIM QUESTIONS AND WEPT AS HE ASK'D THEM WHAT SIR SAID THE FISHERMAN

2262-141717-0040 THAT HE WHO IS SO LAVISH OF HIS FAVOURS SHOULD BE OVERWHELM'D WITH GREATER MISFORTUNES THAN THE MAN HE SO GENEROUSLY RELIEVES YOUR GREATEST UNEASINESS SAID HE AROSE FROM THE NARROWNESS OF YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES
2262-141717-0041 BUT MINE PROCEEDS FROM AN INTERNAL AND MUCH DEEPER CAUSE PRAY SIR SAID THE FISHERMAN HAS ORCAN ROBB'D YOU OF YOUR WIFE THIS INTERROGATORY PUT ZADIG IN A MOMENT UPON A RETROSPECTION OF ALL HIS PAST ADVENTURES
