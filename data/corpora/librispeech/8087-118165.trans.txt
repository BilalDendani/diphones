8087-118165-0000 AND THE YEAR INSUING INHABITED BY THE SPANIARDS AND AFTERWARD A MULTITUDE OF THEM TRAVELLED THITHER FROM SPAIN FOR THE SPACE OF NINE AND FORTY YEARS THEIR FIRST ATTEMPT WAS ON THE SPANISH ISLAND
8087-118165-0001 WHICH INDEED IS A MOST FERTILE SOIL AND AT PRESENT IN GREAT REPUTATION FOR ITS SPACIOUSNESS AND LENGTH CONTAINING IN CIRCUMFERENCE SIX HUNDRED MILES
8087-118165-0002 NAY IT IS ON ALL SIDES SURROUNDED WITH AN ALMOST INNUMERABLE NUMBER OF ISLANDS WHICH WE FOUND SO WELL PEOPLED WITH NATIVES AND FORREIGNERS THAT THERE IS SCARCE ANY REGION IN THE UNIVERSE FORTIFIED WITH SO MANY INHABITANTS
8087-118165-0003 BUT THE MAIN LAND OR CONTINENT DISTANT FROM THIS ISLAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES AND UPWARDS EXTENDS IT SELF ABOVE TEN THOUSAND MILES IN LENGTH NEAR THE SEA SHORE WHICH LANDS ARE SOME OF THEM ALREADY DISCOVER'D
8087-118165-0004 AND MORE MAY BE FOUND OUT IN PROCESS OF TIME AND SUCH A MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE INHABITS THESE COUNTRIES THAT IT SEEMS AS IF THE OMNIPOTENT GOD HAS ASSEMBLED AND CONVOCATED THE MAJOR PART
8087-118165-0005 OF MANKIND IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD NOW THIS INFINITE MULTITUDE OF MEN ARE BY THE CREATION OF GOD INNOCENTLY SIMPLE ALTOGETHER VOID OF AND AVERSE TO ALL MANNER OF CRAFT SUBTLETY AND MALICE
8087-118165-0006 AND MOST OBEDIENT AND LOYAL SUBJECTS TO THEIR NATIVE SOVEREIGNS AND BEHAVE THEMSELVES VERY PATIENTLY SUMISSIVELY AND QUIETLY TOWARDS THE SPANIARDS TO WHOM THEY ARE SUBSERVIENT AND SUBJECT SO THAT FINALLY
8087-118165-0007 AND IN FEW YEARS BY ONE DISTEMPER OR OTHER SOON EXPIRE SO THAT THE VERY ISSUE OF LORDS AND PRINCES WHO AMONG US LIVE WITH GREAT AFFLUENCE AND FARD DELICIOUSLY
8087-118165-0008 HAVING NO OTHER COVERING BUT WHAT CONCEALS THEIR PUDENDS FROM PUBLICK SIGHT AN HAIRY PLAD OR LOOSE COAT ABOUT AN ELL OR A COARSE WOVEN CLOTH AT MOST TWO ELLS LONG SERVES THEM
8087-118165-0009 FOR THE WARMEST WINTER GARMENT THEY LYE ON A COARSE RUG OR MATT AND THOSE THAT HAVE THE MOST PLENTIFUL ESTATE OR FORTUNES THE BETTER SORT USE NET WORK KNOTTED AT THE FOUR CORNERS
8087-118165-0010 IN LIEU OF BEDS WHICH THE INHABITANTS OF THE ISLAND OF HISPANIOLA IN THEIR OWN PROPER IDIOM TERM HAMMACKS THE MEN ARE PREGNANT AND DOCIBLE THE NATIVES TRACTABLE
8087-118165-0011 AND CAPABLE OF MORALITY OR GOODNESS VERY APT TO RECEIVE THE INSTILL'D PRINCIPLES OF CATHOLICK RELIGION NOR ARE THEY AVERSE TO CIVILITY AND GOOD MANNERS BEING NOT SO MUCH
8087-118165-0012 DISCOMPOS'D BY VARIETY OF OBSTRUCTIONS AS THE REST OF MANKIND INSOMUCH THAT HAVING SUCKT IN
8087-118165-0013 PATIENCE TO UNDERGO SUCH EXTREAM TRANSPORTS AND TO CONCLUDE I MY SELF HAVE HEARD THE SPANIARDS THEMSELVES WHO DARE NOT ASSUME THE CONFIDENCE TO DENY THE GOOD NATURE PRAEDOMINANT IN THEM DECLARE THAT
8087-118165-0014 THERE WAS NOTHING WANTING IN THEM FOR THE ACQUISITION OF ETERNAL BEATITUDE BUT THE SOLE KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEITY THE SPANIARDS FIRST ASSAULTED THE INNOCENT SHEEP SO QUALIFIED BY THE ALMIGHTY AS IS PREMENTION'D
8087-118165-0015 LIKE MOST CRUEL TYGERS WOLVES AND LIONS HUNGER STARV'D STUDYING NOTHING FOR THE SPACE OF FORTY YEARS AFTER THEIR FIRST LANDING BUT THE MASSACRE OF THESE WRETCHES WHOM THEY HAVE SO INHUMANELY
8087-118165-0016 THAT OF THREE MILLIONS OF PERSONS WHICH LIVED IN HISPANIOLA ITSELF THERE IS AT PRESENT BUT THE INCONSIDERABLE REMNANT OF SCARCE THREE HUNDRED NAY THE ISLE OF CUBA
8087-118165-0017 WHICH EXTENDS AS FAR AS VALLEDOLID IN SPAIN IS DISTANT FROM ROME LIES NOW UNCULTIVATED LIKE A DESERT AND INTOMB'D IN ITS OWN RUINS YOU MAY ALSO FIND THE ISLES OF SAINT JOHN AND JAMAICA
8087-118165-0018 BOTH LARGE AND FRUITFUL PLACES UNPEOPLED AND DESOLATE THE LUCAYAN ISLANDS ON THE NORTH SIDE ADJACENT TO HISPANIOLA AND CUBA WHICH ARE SIXTY IN NUMBER OR THEREABOUT
8087-118165-0019 AND OTHERS THE MOST INFERTILE WHEREOF EXCEEDS THE ROYAL GARDEN OF SEVIL IN FRUITFULNESS A MOST HEALTHFUL AND PLEASANT CLIMAT IS NOW LAID WASTE AND UNINHABITED
8087-118165-0020 AND WHEREAS WHEN THE SPANIARDS FIRST ARRIV'D HERE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN DWELT IN IT THEY ARE NOW CUT OFF SOME BY SLAUGHTER AND OTHERS RAVISHED AWAY BY FORCE AND VIOLENCE
8087-118165-0021 UNDERTOOK THIS DANGEROUS VOYAGE TO CONVERT SOULS TO CHRISTIANITY THE REMAINING GLEANINGS MIGHT BE GATHERED UP THERE WERE ONLY FOUND ELEVEN PERSONS WHICH I SAW WITH MY OWN EYES THERE ARE OTHER ISLANDS THIRTY IN NUMBER
8087-118165-0022 AND UPWARD BORDERING UPON THE ISLE OF SAINT JOHN TOTALLY UNPEOPLED ALL WHICH ARE ABOVE TWO THOUSAND MILES IN LENGHT AND YET REMAIN WITHOUT INHABITANTS NATIVE OR PEOPLE
8087-118165-0023 AS TO THE FIRM LAND WE ARE CERTAINLY SATISFIED AND ASSUR'D THAT THE SPANIARDS BY THEIR BARBAROUS AND EXECRABLE ACTIONS HAVE ABSOLUTELY DEPOPULATED TEN KINGDOMS OF GREATER EXTENT THAN ALL SPAIN
8087-118165-0024 TOGETHER WITH THE KINGDOMS OF ARRAGON AND PORTUGAL THAT IS TO SAY ABOVE ONE THOUSAND MILES
8087-118165-0025 AND DESOLATE AND ARE ABSOLUTELY RUINED WHEN AS FORMERLY NO OTHER COUNTRY WHATSOEVER WAS MORE POPULOUS NAY WE DARE BOLDLY AFFIRM THAT DURING THE FORTY YEARS SPACE WHEREIN THEY EXERCISED THEIR
8087-118165-0026 SANGUINARY AND DETESTABLE TYRANNY IN THESE REGIONS ABOVE TWELVE MILLIONS COMPUTING MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAVE UNDESERVEDLY PERISHED NOR DO I CONCEIVE THAT I SHOULD DEVIATE FROM THE TRUTH BY SAYING THAT ABOVE
8087-118165-0027 FIFTY MILLIONS IN ALL PAID THEIR LAST DEBT TO NATURE THOSE THAT ARRIV'D AT THESE ISLANDS FROM THE REMOTEST PARTS OF SPAIN AND WHO PRIDE THEMSELVES IN THE NAME OF CHRISTIANS STEER'D TWO COURSES PRINCIPALLY
8087-118165-0028 IN ORDER TO THE EXTIRPATION AND EXTERMINATING OF THIS PEOPLE FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH THE FIRST WHEREOF WAS RAISING AN UNJUST SANGUINOLENT CRUEL WAR THE OTHER BY PUTTING THEM TO DEATH
8087-118165-0029 AND SHAKE OFF THE SHACKLES OF SO INJURIOUS A CAPTIVITY FOR THEY BEING TAKEN OFF IN WAR NONE BUT WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE PERMITTED TO ENJOY THE BENEFIT OF THAT COUNTRY AIR IN WHOM THEY DID IN SUCCEEDING TIMES
8087-118165-0030 LAY SUCH A HEAVY YOAK THAT THE VERY BRUTES WERE MORE HAPPY THAN THEY TO WHICH TWO SPECIES OF TYRANNY AS SUBALTERNATE THINGS TO THE GENUS THE OTHER INNUMERABLE COURSES THEY TOOK
8087-118165-0031 OF THIS PEOPLE WAS GOLD ONLY THAT THEREBY GROWING OPULENT IN A SHORT TIME THEY MIGHT ARRIVE AT ONCE AT SUCH DEGREES AND DIGNITIES AS WERE NO WAYES CONSISTENT WITH THEIR PERSONS
8087-118165-0032 FINALLY IN ONE WORD THEIR AMBITION AND AVARICE THAN WHICH THE HEART OF MAN NEVER ENTERTAINED GREATER AND THE VAST WEALTH OF THOSE REGIONS THE HUMILITY AND PATIENCE OF THE INHABITANTS
8087-118165-0033 WHICH MADE THEIR APPROACH TO THESE LANDS MORE FACIL AND EASIE DID MUCH PROMOTE THE BUSINESS WHOM THEY SO DESPICABLY CONTEMNED THAT THEY TREATED THEM
8087-118165-0034 I SPEAK OF THINGS WHICH I WAS AN EYE WITNESS OF WITHOUT THE LEAST FALLACY NOT AS BEASTS WHICH I CORDIALLY WISHED THEY WOULD BUT AS THE MOST ABJECT DUNG AND FILTH OF THE EARTH AND SO SOLLICITOUS
8087-118165-0035 THEY WERE OF THEIR LIFE AND SOUL THAT THE ABOVE MENTIONED NUMBER OF PEOPLE DIED WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE TRUE FAITH OR SACRAMENTS AND THIS ALSO IS AS REALLY TRUE AS THE PRAECENDENT NARRATION
