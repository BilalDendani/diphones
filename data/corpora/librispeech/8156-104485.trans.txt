8156-104485-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE HARRY ANNESLEY'S SUCCESS HARRY ANNESLEY A DAY OR TWO AFTER HE HAD LEFT TRETTON
8156-104485-0001 AND WITH THE INVITATION AN INTIMATION THAT FLORENCE MOUNTJOY WAS TO BE AT THE DANCE IF I WERE TO DECLARE THAT THE DANCE HAD BEEN GIVEN AND FLORENCE ASKED TO IT MERELY AS AN ACT OF FRIENDSHIP TO HARRY IT WOULD PERHAPS BE THOUGHT THAT MODERN FRIENDSHIP IS SELDOM CARRIED TO SO GREAT A LENGTH
8156-104485-0002 BUT IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE FACT THAT MISSUS ARMITAGE WHO GAVE THE DANCE WAS A GREAT FRIEND AND ADMIRER OF HARRY'S AND THAT MISTER ARMITAGE WAS AN ESPECIAL CHUM LET NOT HOWEVER ANY READER SUPPOSE THAT FLORENCE WAS IN THE SECRET
8156-104485-0003 AS TO MY GOING TO MONTPELIER PLACE HARRY HAD ONCE SAID TO MISSUS ARMITAGE I MIGHT AS WELL KNOCK AT A PRISON DOOR MISSUS MOUNTJOY LIVED IN MONTPELIER PLACE
8156-104485-0004 AND SHE HAD MANAGED IT IS SHE COMING HARRY SAID TO MISSUS ARMITAGE IN AN ANXIOUS WHISPER AS HE ENTERED THE ROOM SHE HAS BEEN HERE THIS HALF HOUR
8156-104485-0005 SHE HAS NOT GONE SAID HARRY ALMOST AWE STRUCK AT THE IDEA NO SHE IS SITTING LIKE PATIENCE ON A MONUMENT SMILING AT GRIEF IN THE ROOM INSIDE SHE HAS GOT HORRIBLE NEWS TO TELL YOU OH HEAVENS WHAT NEWS
8156-104485-0006 AND THAT SHE IS TO LIVE FOR A WHILE AMID THE AMBASSADORIAL SPLENDORS WITH SIR MAGNUS AND HIS WIFE BY RETIRING FROM THE WORLD MISSUS MOUNTJOY HAD NOT INTENDED TO INCLUDE SUCH SLIGHT SOCIAL RELAXATIONS AS MISSUS ARMITAGE'S PARTY FOR HARRY ON TURNING ROUND
8156-104485-0007 HE GREETED HER WITH HIS PLEASANTEST SMILE TO WHICH MISSUS MOUNTJOY DID NOT RESPOND QUITE SO SWEETLY
8156-104485-0008 AND HAD TO DAY HEARD A STORY VERY MUCH AS SHE THOUGHT TO HIS DISCREDIT IS YOUR DAUGHTER HERE ASKED HARRY WITH WELL TRAINED HYPOCRISY MISSUS MOUNTJOY COULD NOT BUT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FLORENCE WAS IN THE ROOM AND THEN HARRY PASSED ON IN PURSUIT OF HIS QUARRY
8156-104485-0009 OH MISTER ANNESLEY WHEN DID YOU COME TO CHELTENHAM
8156-104485-0010 I BEGAN TO THINK OF COMING IMMEDIATELY THEN AN IDEA FOR THE FIRST TIME SHOT THROUGH FLORENCE'S MIND
8156-104485-0011 WHAT DANCE HAVE YOU DISENGAGED I HAVE SOMETHING THAT I MUST TELL YOU TO NIGHT
8156-104485-0012 THIS WAS MERELY A LOVER'S ANXIOUS DOUBT ON HIS PART BECAUSE FLORENCE HAD NOT AT ONCE REPLIED TO HIM I AM TOLD THAT YOU ARE GOING AWAY TO BRUSSELS MAMMA IS GOING ON A VISIT TO HER BROTHER IN LAW AND YOU WITH HER OF COURSE I SHALL GO WITH MAMMA
8156-104485-0013 ALL THIS HAD BEEN SAID APART WHILE A FAIR HAIRED LACKADAISICAL YOUNG GENTLEMAN WAS STANDING TWIDDLING HIS THUMBS WAITING TO DANCE WITH FLORENCE
8156-104485-0014 AND HARRY'S NAME WAS DULY INSCRIBED THE NEXT DANCE WAS A QUADRILLE
8156-104485-0015 SO HE BOLDLY WROTE DOWN HIS NAME FOR BOTH I ALMOST THINK THAT FLORENCE MUST HAVE SUSPECTED THAT HARRY ANNESLEY WAS TO BE THERE THAT NIGHT OR WHY SHOULD THE TWO PLACES HAVE BEEN KEPT VACANT AND NOW WHAT IS THIS HE BEGAN ABOUT YOUR GOING TO BRUSSELS
8156-104485-0016 MAMMA'S BROTHER IS MINISTER THERE AND WE ARE JUST GOING ON A VISIT BUT WHY NOW I AM SURE THERE IS SOME ESPECIAL CAUSE FLORENCE WOULD NOT SAY THAT THERE WAS NO ESPECIAL CAUSE SO SHE COULD ONLY REPEAT HER ASSERTION THAT THEY CERTAINLY WERE GOING TO BRUSSELS
8156-104485-0017 SHE HERSELF WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS TO BE TAKEN OUT OF HARRY'S WAY AND THAT SOMETHING WAS EXPECTED TO OCCUR DURING THIS SHORT MONTH OF HER ABSENCE WHICH MIGHT BE DETRIMENTAL TO HIM
8156-104485-0018 NOR DID SHE LIKE TO SAY THAT THE PLEA GIVEN BY HER MOTHER WAS THE GENERAL STATE OF THE SCARBOROUGH AFFAIRS SHE DID NOT WISH TO DECLARE TO THIS LOVER THAT THAT OTHER LOVER WAS AS NOTHING TO HER AND HOW LONG ARE YOU TO BE AWAY ASKED HARRY
8156-104485-0019 WE SHALL BE A MONTH WITH SIR MAGNUS BUT MAMMA IS TALKING OF GOING ON AFTERWARD TO THE ITALIAN LAKES GOOD HEAVENS YOU WILL NOT BE BACK I SUPPOSE TILL EVER SO MUCH AFTER CHRISTMAS I CANNOT TELL NOTHING AS YET HAS BEEN SETTLED
8156-104485-0020 I DO NOT KNOW THAT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT IT HARRY AT THIS MOMENT LOOKED UP AND CAUGHT THE EYE OF MISSUS MOUNTJOY AS SHE WAS STANDING IN THE DOOR WAY OPPOSITE
8156-104485-0021 THEN HOWEVER IT CAME TO HIS TURN TO DANCE AND HE HAD A MOMENT ALLOWED TO HIM TO COLLECT HIS THOUGHTS BY NOTHING THAT HE COULD DO OR SAY COULD HE PREVENT HER GOING AND HE COULD ONLY USE THE PRESENT MOMENT TO THE BEST PURPOSE IN HIS POWER HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF THEN
8156-104485-0022 AND THAT SUCH WORD IF EVER TO BE SPOKEN SHOULD BE FORTHCOMING THAT NIGHT WHAT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN TO A GIRL WHO WAS PASSING THE BALMY CHRISTMAS MONTHS AMID THE SWEET SHADOWS OF AN ITALIAN LAKE
8156-104485-0023 AT PRESENT SOMEWHAT VAGUE BUT FUTURE MONTHS WERE TO HIS THINKING INTERMINABLE THE PRESENT MOMENT ONLY WAS HIS OWN THE DANCE WAS NOW FINISHED COME AND TAKE A WALK SAID HARRY I THINK I WILL GO TO MAMMA
8156-104485-0024 FLORENCE HAD SEEN HER MOTHER'S EYE FIXED UPON HER OH COME THAT WON'T DO AT ALL SAID HARRY WHO HAD ALREADY GOT HER HAND WITHIN HIS ARM A FELLOW IS ALWAYS ENTITLED TO FIVE MINUTES AND THEN I AM DOWN FOR THE NEXT WALTZ OH NO BUT I AM AND YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF IT NOW
8156-104485-0025 OH FLORENCE WILL YOU ANSWER ME A QUESTION ONE QUESTION I ASKED IT YOU BEFORE AND YOU DID NOT VOUCHSAFE ME ANY ANSWER YOU ASKED ME NO QUESTION SAID FLORENCE WHO REMEMBERED TO THE LAST SYLLABLE EVERY WORD THAT HAD BEEN SAID TO HER ON THAT OCCASION
8156-104485-0026 OH FLORENCE CAN YOU LOVE ME HAD SHE GIVEN HER EARS FOR IT SHE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD HIM THE TRUTH THEN ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT HER MOTHER'S EYE WAS SHE KNEW WATCHING HER THROUGH THE DOOR WAY ALL THE WAY ACROSS FROM THE OTHER ROOM
8156-104485-0027 AND HAVE DECLARED THAT SHE REGARDED HIM ALREADY AS HER LORD AND MASTER BUT NOW SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY TO HIM ALL SHE KNEW WAS THAT HE HAD NOW PLEDGED HIMSELF TO HER AND THAT SHE INTENDED TO KEEP HIM TO HIS PLEDGE MAY I NOT HAVE ONE WORD
8156-104485-0028 HE SAID ONE WORD WHAT COULD HE WANT WITH A WORD MORE THOUGHT FLORENCE HER SILENCE NOW WAS AS GOOD AS ANY SPEECH
8156-104485-0029 SO THERE CAME UPON HIS ARM THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBLE SENSE OF PRESSURE FROM THOSE SWEET FINGERS
8156-104485-0030 AFTER A MOMENT HE STOOD STILL AND PASSED HIS FINGERS THROUGH HIS HAIR AND WAVED HIS HEAD AS A GOD MIGHT DO IT
8156-104485-0031 OH FLORENCE HE EXCLAIMED I MUST HAVE YOU ALONE WITH ME FOR ONE MOMENT
8156-104485-0032 THOUGHT FLORENCE THERE WAS HER MOTHER STILL LOOKING AT THEM BUT FOR HER HARRY DID NOT NOW CARE ONE STRAW NOR DID HE HATE THOSE BRIGHT ITALIAN LAKES WITH NEARLY SO STRONG A FEELING OF ABHORRENCE FLORENCE YOU ARE NOW ALL MY OWN
8156-104485-0033 THERE CAME ANOTHER SLIGHTEST PRESSURE SLIGHT BUT SO ELOQUENT FROM THOSE FINGERS I HATE DANCING HOW IS A FELLOW TO DANCE NOW I SHALL RUN AGAINST EVERYBODY I CAN SEE NO ONE I SHOULD BE SURE TO MAKE A FOOL OF MYSELF
8156-104485-0034 WELL IF I MUST OF COURSE I MUST
8156-104485-0035 THOUGH THERE IS SO MUCH THAT YOU MUST HAVE TO SAY WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY WHAT A QUESTION TO ASK YOU MUST TELL ME OH YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE GOT TO TELL ME
8156-104485-0036 SHE WHISPERED BUT I WANT TO HEAR IT OH FLORENCE FLORENCE I DO NOT THINK YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW COMPLETELY I AM BEYOND MYSELF WITH JOY I CANNOT DANCE AGAIN AND WILL NOT OH MY WIFE MY WIFE HUSH SAID FLORENCE
8156-104485-0037 AFRAID THAT THE VERY WALLS MIGHT HEAR THE SOUND OF HARRY'S WORDS WHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY THOUGH ALL THE WORLD KNEW IT OH YES
8156-104485-0038 THAT IS WHAT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND POOR MOUNTJOY I DO FEEL FOR HIM THAT HE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE START OF ME SO LONG AND HAVE DONE NOTHING NOTHING WHISPERED FLORENCE
8156-104485-0039 AND FLORENCE FOUND THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO SAY ONE WORD YOU ARE MY HERO THE SOUND OF THIS NEARLY DROVE HIM MAD WITH JOY HE FORGOT ALL HIS TROUBLES PRODGERS THE POLICEMAN AUGUSTUS SCARBOROUGH AND THAT FELLOW WHOM HE HATED SO MUCH SEPTIMUS JONES
8156-104485-0040 WHAT WERE THEY ALL TO HIM NOW HE HAD SET HIS MIND UPON ONE THING OF VALUE AND HE HAD GOT IT
8156-104485-0041 BUT HE FELT THAT FOR THE FULL ENJOYMENT OF HIS TRIUMPH HE MUST BE ALONE SOMEWHERE WITH FLORENCE FOR FIVE MINUTES HE HAD NOT ACTUALLY EXPLAINED TO HIMSELF WHY BUT HE KNEW THAT HE WISHED TO BE ALONE WITH HER AT PRESENT THERE WAS NO PROSPECT OF ANY SUCH FIVE MINUTES
8156-104485-0042 BUT HE MUST SAY SOMETHING IN PREPARATION FOR SOME FUTURE FIVE MINUTES AT A TIME TO COME PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE TO MORROW THOUGH HE DID NOT AT PRESENT SEE HOW THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE FOR MISSUS MOUNTJOY HE KNEW WOULD SHUT HER DOOR AGAINST HIM
8156-104485-0043 HARRY SAW HER AS HE GOT FLORENCE TO AN OPPOSITE DOOR AND THERE FOR THE MOMENT ESCAPED WITH HER AND NOW HE SAID HOW AM I TO MANAGE TO SEE YOU BEFORE YOU GO TO BRUSSELS
8156-104485-0044 I DO MEAN IT MAMMA IS OF COURSE ATTACHED TO HER NEPHEW WHAT AFTER ALL THAT HAS PASSED WHY NOT IS HE TO BLAME FOR WHAT HIS FATHER HAS DONE HARRY FELT THAT HE COULD NOT PRESS THE CASE AGAINST CAPTAIN SCARBOROUGH
8156-104485-0045 WITHOUT SOME WANT OF GENEROSITY AND THOUGH HE HAD TOLD FLORENCE ONCE ABOUT THAT DREADFUL MIDNIGHT MEETING HE COULD SAY NOTHING FARTHER ON THAT SUBJECT OF COURSE MAMMA THINKS THAT I AM FOOLISH BUT WHY HE ASKED BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T SEE WITH MY EYES HARRY
8156-104485-0046 YOU HAVE MADE THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR YOURSELF BEFORE I START
8156-104485-0047 DON'T SAY THAT FLORENCE I SHALL THINK SO UNLESS YOU CAN BE DISCREET HARRY YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT
8156-104485-0048 BUT I SHALL NOT CHANGE NOR I NOR I I THINK NOT BECAUSE I TRUST YOU HERE IS MAMMA AND NOW I MUST LEAVE YOU BUT I SHALL TELL MAMMA EVERYTHING BEFORE I GO TO BED
8156-104485-0049 THEN MISSUS MOUNTJOY CAME UP AND TOOK FLORENCE AWAY WITH A FEW WORDS OF MOST DISDAINFUL GREETING TO HARRY ANNESLEY WHEN FLORENCE WAS GONE HARRY FELT THAT AS THE SUN AND THE MOON AND THE STARS HAD ALL SET
8156-104485-0050 HE MIGHT AS WELL ESCAPE INTO THE STREET WHERE THERE WAS NO ONE BUT THE POLICE TO WATCH HIM AS HE THREW HIS HAT UP INTO THE AIR IN HIS EXULTATION BUT BEFORE HE DID SO HE HAD TO PASS BY MISSUS ARMITAGE AND THANK HER FOR ALL HER KINDNESS
8156-104485-0051 OH MISSUS ARMITAGE I AM SO OBLIGED TO YOU NO FELLOW WAS EVER SO OBLIGED TO A FRIEND BEFORE HOW HAS IT GONE OFF FOR MISSUS MOUNTJOY HAS TAKEN FLORENCE HOME OH YES SHE HAS TAKEN HER AWAY
8156-104485-0052 OH THE STEED HAS BEEN STOLEN YES I THINK SO I DO THINK SO AND THAT POOR MAN WHO HAS DISAPPEARED IS NOWHERE MEN WHO DISAPPEAR NEVER ARE ANYWHERE BUT I DO FLATTER MYSELF THAT IF HE HAD HELD HIS GROUND AND KEPT HIS PROPERTY
8156-104485-0053 I DARE SAY DON'T SUPPOSE MISSUS ARMITAGE THAT I AM TAKING ANY PRIDE TO MYSELF
8156-104485-0054 OH NO NOT IN THE LEAST IT'S ALL VERY WELL FOR YOU TO LAUGH MISSUS ARMITAGE BUT AS I HAVE THOUGHT OF IT ALL I HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN IN DESPAIR BUT NOW YOU ARE NOT IN DESPAIR NO INDEED JUST NOW I AM TRIUMPHANT
8156-104485-0055 I HAVE THOUGHT SO OFTEN THAT I WAS A FOOL TO LOVE HER BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS SO MUCH AGAINST ME I HAVE WONDERED THAT YOU CONTINUED IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT THERE WASN'T A GHOST OF A CHANCE FOR YOU MISTER ARMITAGE BADE ME GIVE IT ALL UP BECAUSE HE WAS SURE YOU WOULD NEVER DO ANY GOOD
8156-104485-0056 I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH YOU LAUGH AT ME MISSUS ARMITAGE
