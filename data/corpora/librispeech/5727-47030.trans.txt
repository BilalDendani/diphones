5727-47030-0000 I SEE RISING OUT OF DARKNESS A LOTOS IN A VASE MOST OF THE VASE IS INVISIBLE BUT I KNOW THAT IT IS OF BRONZE AND THAT ITS GLIMPSING HANDLES ARE BODIES OF DRAGONS ONLY THE LOTOS IS FULLY ILLUMINATED
5727-47030-0001 THREE PURE WHITE FLOWERS AND FIVE GREAT LEAVES OF GOLD AND GREEN GOLD ABOVE GREEN ON THE UPCURLING UNDER SURFACE AN ARTIFICIAL LOTOS IT IS BATHED BY A SLANTING STREAM OF SUNSHINE
5727-47030-0002 THE DARKNESS BENEATH AND BEYOND IS THE DUSK OF A TEMPLE CHAMBER I DO NOT SEE THE OPENING THROUGH WHICH THE RADIANCE POURS BUT I AM AWARE THAT IT IS A SMALL WINDOW SHAPED IN THE OUTLINE FORM OF A TEMPLE BELL
5727-47030-0003 THE REASON THAT I SEE THE LOTOS ONE MEMORY OF MY FIRST VISIT TO A BUDDHIST SANCTUARY IS THAT THERE HAS COME TO ME AN ODOR OF INCENSE OFTEN WHEN I SMELL INCENSE THIS VISION DEFINES
5727-47030-0004 AND USUALLY THEREAFTER OTHER SENSATIONS OF MY FIRST DAY IN JAPAN REVIVE IN SWIFT SUCCESSION WITH ALMOST PAINFUL ACUTENESS IT IS ALMOST UBIQUITOUS THIS PERFUME OF INCENSE
5727-47030-0005 IT MAKES ONE ELEMENT OF THE FAINT BUT COMPLEX AND NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN ODOR OF THE FAR EAST IT HAUNTS THE DWELLING HOUSE NOT LESS THAN THE TEMPLE THE HOME OF THE PEASANT NOT LESS THAN THE YASHIKI OF THE PRINCE
5727-47030-0006 SHINTO SHRINES INDEED ARE FREE FROM IT INCENSE BEING AN ABOMINATION TO THE ELDER GODS BUT WHEREVER BUDDHISM LIVES THERE IS INCENSE IN EVERY HOUSE CONTAINING A BUDDHIST SHRINE OR BUDDHIST TABLETS INCENSE IS BURNED AT CERTAIN TIMES
5727-47030-0007 LITTLE STONE FIGURES OF FUDO JIZO OR KWANNON MANY EXPERIENCES OF TRAVEL STRANGE IMPRESSIONS OF SOUND AS WELL AS OF SIGHT REMAIN ASSOCIATED IN MY OWN MEMORY WITH THAT FRAGRANCE
5727-47030-0008 VAST SILENT SHADOWED AVENUES LEADING TO WEIRD OLD SHRINES MOSSED FLIGHTS OF WORN STEPS ASCENDING TO TEMPLES THAT MOULDER ABOVE THE CLOUDS JOYOUS TUMULT OF FESTIVAL NIGHTS
5727-47030-0009 SHEETED FUNERAL TRAINS GLIDING BY IN GLIMMER OF LANTERNS MURMUR OF HOUSEHOLD PRAYER IN FISHERMEN'S HUTS ON FAR WILD COASTS AND VISIONS OF DESOLATE LITTLE GRAVES MARKED ONLY BY THREADS OF BLUE SMOKE ASCENDING
5727-47030-0010 GRAVES OF PET ANIMALS OR BIRDS REMEMBERED BY SIMPLE HEARTS IN THE HOUR OF PRAYER TO AMIDA THE LORD OF IMMEASURABLE LIGHT BUT THE ODOR OF WHICH I SPEAK IS THAT OF CHEAP INCENSE ONLY THE INCENSE IN GENERAL USE
5727-47030-0011 THERE ARE MANY OTHER KINDS OF INCENSE AND THE RANGE OF QUALITY IS AMAZING A BUNDLE OF COMMON INCENSE RODS THEY ARE ABOUT AS THICK AS AN ORDINARY PENCIL LEAD AND SOMEWHAT LONGER CAN BE BOUGHT FOR A FEW SEN
5727-47030-0012 WHILE A BUNDLE OF BETTER QUALITY PRESENTING TO INEXPERIENCED EYES ONLY SOME DIFFERENCE IN COLOR MAY COST SEVERAL YEN AND BE CHEAP AT THE PRICE STILL COSTLIER SORTS OF INCENSE VERITABLE LUXURIES TAKE THE FORM OF LOZENGES WAFERS PASTILLES
5727-47030-0013 BUT THE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL QUESTIONS RELATING TO JAPANESE INCENSE REPRESENT THE LEAST INTERESTING PART OF A REMARKABLY CURIOUS SUBJECT TWO CURIOUS INDEED
5727-47030-0014 BUT ENORMOUS BY REASON OF IT INFINITY OF TRADITION AND DETAIL I AM AFRAID EVEN TO THINK OF THE SIZE OF THE VOLUME THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO COVER IT SUCH A WORK WOULD PROPERLY BEGIN WITH SOME BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE EARLIEST KNOWLEDGE AND USE OF AROMATICS IN JAPAN
5727-47030-0015 AN IMAGE OF THE BUDDHA AND ONE COMPLETE SET OF FURNITURE FOR A TEMPLE THEN SOMETHING WOULD HAVE TO BE SAID ABOUT THOSE CLASSIFICATIONS OF INCENSE WHICH WERE MADE DURING THE TENTH CENTURY IN THE PERIODS OF ENGI AND OF TENRYAKU AND ABOUT THE REPORT OF THE ANCIENT STATE COUNCILLOR
5727-47030-0016 KIMITAKA SANGI WHO VISITED CHINA IN THE LATTER PART OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY AND TRANSMITTED TO THE EMPEROR YOMEI THE WISDOM OF THE CHINESE CONCERNING INCENSE THEN MENTION SHOULD BE MADE OF THE ANCIENT INCENSES STILL PRESERVED IN VARIOUS JAPANESE TEMPLES
5727-47030-0017 AND OF THE FAMOUS FRAGMENTS OF RANJATAI PUBLICLY EXHIBITED AT NARA IN THE TENTH YEAR OF MEIJI WHICH FURNISHED SUPPLIES TO THE THREE GREAT CAPTAINS NOBUNAGA HIDEYOSHI AND IYEYASU
5727-47030-0018 AFTER THIS SHOULD FOL LOW AN OUTLINE OF THE HISTORY OF MIXED INCENSES MADE IN JAPAN WITH NOTES ON THE CLASSIFICATIONS DEVISED BY THE LUXURIOUS TAKAUJI AND ON THE NOMENCLATURE ESTABLISHED LATER BY ASHIKAGA YOSHIMASA
5727-47030-0019 PRESERVED IN SEVERAL PRINCELY FAMILIES TOGETHER WITH SPECIMENS OF THOSE HEREDITARY RECIPES FOR INCENSE MAKING WHICH HAVE BEEN TRANSMITTED FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION THROUGH HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND ARE STILL CALLED AFTER THEIR AUGUST INVENTORS AS
5727-47030-0020 RECIPES ALSO SHOULD BE GIVEN OF THOSE STRANGE INCENSES MADE TO IMITATE THE PERFUME OF THE LOTOS THE SMELL OF THE SUMMER BREEZE AND THE ODOR OF THE AUTUMN WIND SOME LEGENDS OF THE GREAT PERIOD OF INCENSE LUXURY SHOULD BE CITED
5727-47030-0021 WHO BUILT FOR HIMSELF A PALACE OF INCENSE WOODS AND SET FIRE TO IT ON THE NIGHT OF HIS REVOLT WHEN THE SMOKE OF ITS BURNING PERFUMED THE LAND TO A DISTANCE OF TWELVE MILES OF COURSE THE MERE COMPILATION OF MATERIALS FOR A HISTORY OF MIXED INCENSES
5727-47030-0022 WOULD ENTAIL THE STUDY OF A HOST OF DOCUMENTS TREATISES AND BOOKS PARTICULARLY OF SUCH STRANGE WORKS AS THE KUN SHU RUI SHO OR INCENSE COLLECTOR'S CLASSIFYING MANUAL CONTAINING THE TEACHINGS OF THE TEN SCHOOLS OF THE ART OF MIXING INCENSE
5727-47030-0023 DIRECTIONS AS TO THE BEST SEASONS FOR INCENSE MAKING AND INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF FIRE TO BE USED FOR BURNING INCENSE ONE KIND IS CALLED LITERARY FIRE AND ANOTHER MILITARY FIRE
5727-47030-0024 CORRESPONDING TO SEASON AND OCCASION
5727-47030-0025 KUSADAMA HUNG UP IN HOUSES TO DRIVE AWAY GOBLINS AND TO THE SMALLER INCENSE BAGS FORMERLY CARRIED ABOUT THE PERSON AS A PROTECTION AGAINST EVIL SPIRITS THEN A VERY LARGE PART OF THE WORK WOULD HAVE TO BE DEVOTED TO THE RELIGIOUS USES
5727-47030-0026 AND LEGENDS OF INCENSE A HUGE SUBJECT IN ITSELF THERE WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED THE CURIOUS HISTORY OF THE OLD INCENSE ASSEMBLIES WHOSE ELABORATE CEREMONIAL COULD BE EXPLAINED ONLY BY HELP OF NUMEROUS DIAGRAMS
5727-47030-0027 ONE CHAPTER AT LEAST WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR THE SUBJECT OF THE ANCIENT IMPORTATION OF INCENSE MATERIALS FROM INDIA CHINA ANNAM
5727-47030-0028 PLACES ALL NAMED IN RARE BOOKS ABOUT INCENSE AND A FINAL CHAPTER SHOULD TREAT OF THE ROMANTIC LITERATURE OF INCENSE THE POEMS STORIES AND DRAMAS IN WHICH INCENSE RITES ARE MENTIONED AND ESPECIALLY THOSE LOVE SONGS COMPARING THE BODY TO INCENSE
5727-47030-0029 AND PASSION TO THE EATING FLAME EVEN AS BURNS THE PERFUME LENDING THY ROBE ITS FRAGANCE SMOULDERS MY LIFE AWAY CONSUMED BY THE PAIN OF LONGING THE MEREST OUTLINE OF THE SUBJECT IS TERRIFYING
5727-47030-0030 AN SOKU KO THIS IS VERY CHEAP GREAT QUANTITIES OF IT ARE BURNED BY PILGRIMS IN THE BRONZE CENSERS SET BEFORE THE ENTRANCES OF FAMOUS TEMPLES AND IN FRONT OF ROADSIDE IMAGES YOU MAY OFTEN SEE BUNDLES OF IT THESE ARE FOR THE USE OF PIOUS WAYFARERS
5727-47030-0031 ALTOGETHER THREE CLASSES OF PERFUMES ARE EMPLOYED IN BUDDHIST RITES KO OR INCENSE PROPER IN MANY VARIETIES THE WORD LITERALLY MEANS ONLY FRAGRANT SUBSTANCE DZUKO AN ODOROUS OINTMENT
5727-47030-0032 KO IS BURNED DZUKO IS RUBBED UPON THE HANDS OF THE PRIEST AS AN OINTMENT OF PURIFICATION AND MAKKO IS SPRINKLED ABOUT THE SANCTUARY THIS MAKKO IS SAID TO BE IDENTICAL WITH THE SANDALWOOD POWDER SO FREQUENTLY MENTIONED IN BUDDHIST TEXTS
5727-47030-0033 BUT IT IS ONLY THE TRUE INCENSE WHICH CAN BE SAID TO BEAR AN IMPORTANT RELATION TO THE RELIGIOUS SERVICE INCENSE DECLARES THE SOSHI RYAKU
5727-47030-0034 IS THE MESSENGER OF EARNEST DESIRE WHEN THE RICH SUDATTA WISHED TO INVITE THE BUDDHA TO A REPAST HE MADE USE OF INCENSE HE WAS WONT TO ASCEND TO THE ROOF OF HIS HOUSE ON THE EVE OF THE DAY OF THE ENTERTAINMENT
5727-47030-0035 AND TO REMAIN STANDING THERE ALL NIGHT HOLDING A CENSER OF PRECIOUS INCENSE AND AS OFTEN AS HE DID THUS THE BUDDHA NEVER FAILED TO COME ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AT THE EXACT TIME DESIRED
5727-47030-0036 SOME OF THESE AND NOT THE LEAST INTERESTING OCCUR IN PRAYERS OF WHICH THE FOLLOWING FROM THE BOOK CALLED HOJI SAN
5727-47030-0037 IS A STRIKING EXAMPLE LET MY BODY REMAIN PURE LIKE A CENSER LET MY THOUGHT BE EVER AS A FIRE OF WISDOM PURELY CONSUMING THE INCENSE
5727-47030-0038 THAT SO MAY I DO HOMAGE TO ALL THE BUDDHAS IN THE TEN DIRECTIONS OF THE PAST THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE
5727-47030-0039 AND THE SMOKE MOUNT SKYWARD NOW THE BREATH OF THIS BODY OF OURS THIS IMPERMANENT COMBINATION OF EARTH WATER AIR AND FIRE IS LIKE THAT SMOKE AND THE CHANGING OF THE INCENSE INTO COLD ASHES WHEN THE FLAME EXPIRES
5727-47030-0040 IN THE THIRTY SECOND VOW FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF THE PARADISE OF WONDROUS INCENSE HE SAYS IT IS WRITTEN
5727-47030-0041 IN ANCIENT TIMES THERE WERE MEN OF SUPERIOR WISDOM AND VIRTUE WHO BY REASON OF THEIR VOW OBTAINED PERCEPTION OF THE ODOR BUT WE WHO ARE BORN WITH INFERIOR WISDOM AND VIRTUE IN THESE LATER DAYS CANNOT OBTAIN SUCH PERCEPTION NEVERTHELESS
5727-47030-0042 INCENSE BURNING HAS BEEN AN AMUSEMENT OF THE ARISTOCRACY EVER SINCE THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY PROBABLY YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE JAPANESE TEA CEREMONIES AND THEIR CURIOUS BUDDHIST HISTORY
5727-47030-0043 AND I SUPPOSE THAT EVERY FOREIGN COLLECTOR OF JAPANESE BRIC BRAC KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT THE LUXURY TO WHICH THESE CEREMONIES AT ONE PERIOD ATTAINED A LUXURY WELL ATTESTED BY THE QUALITY OF THE BEAUTIFUL UTENSILS FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN THEM
5727-47030-0044 BUT THERE WERE AND STILL ARE INCENSE CEREMONIES MUCH MORE ELABORATE AND COSTLY THAN THE TEA CEREMONIES AND ALSO MUCH MORE INTERESTING BESIDES MUSIC EMBROIDERY POETICAL COMPOSITION AND OTHER BRANCHES OF THE OLD FASHIONED FEMALE EDUCATION
5727-47030-0045 THE YOUNG LADY OF PRE MEIJI DAYS WAS EXPECTED TO ACQUIRE THREE ESPECIALLY POLITE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THE ART OF ARRANGING FLOWERS IKEBANA THE ART OF CEREMONIAL TEA MAKING CHA NO YU OR CHA NO E
5727-47030-0046 KO KWAI OR KO E INCENSE PARTIES WERE INVENTED BEFORE THE TIME OF THE ASHIKAGA SHOGUNS AND WERE MOST IN VOGUE DURING THE PEACEFUL PERIOD OF THE TOKUGAWA RULE WITH THE FALL OF THE SHOGUNATE THEY WENT OUT OF FASHION
5727-47030-0047 BUT RECENTLY THEY HAVE BEEN TO SOME EXTENT REVIVED IT IS NOT LIKELY HOWEVER THAT THEY WILL AGAIN BECOME REALLY FASHIONABLE IN THE OLD SENSE
5727-47030-0048 AND PARTLY BECAUSE OF THEIR COSTLINESS IN TRANSLATING KO KWAI AS INCENSE PARTY I USE THE WORD PARTY IN THE MEANING THAT IT TAKES IN SUCH COMPOUNDS AS CARD PARTY WHIST PARTY CHESS PARTY
5727-47030-0049 THAT VARIETY OF KO KWAI CALLED JITCHU KO TEN BURNING INCENSE IS GENERALLY CONCEDED TO BE THE MOST AMUSING AND I SHALL TRY TO TELL YOU HOW IT IS PLAYED
5727-47030-0050 THE NUMERAL TEN IN THE JAPANESE OR RATHER CHINESE NAME OF THIS DIVERSION DOES NOT REFER TO TEN KINDS BUT ONLY TO TEN PACKAGES OF INCENSE FOR JITCHU KO BESIDES BEING THE MOST AMUSING IS THE VERY SIMPLEST OF INCENSE GAMES
5727-47030-0051 AND IS PLAYED WITH ONLY FOUR KINDS OF INCENSE ONE KIND MUST BE SUPPLIED BY THE GUESTS INVITED TO THE PARTY AND THREE ARE FURNISHED BY THE PERSON WHO GIVES THE ENTERTAINMENT EACH OF THE LATTER THREE SUPPLIES OF INCENSE
5727-47030-0052 USUALLY PREPARED IN PACKAGES CONTAINING ONE HUNDRED WAFERS IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR PARTS AND EACH PART IS PUT INTO A SEPARATE PAPER NUMBERED OR MARKED SO AS TO INDICATE THE QUALITY THUS
5727-47030-0053 OR TWELVE IN ALL BUT THE INCENSE GIVEN BY THE GUESTS ALWAYS CALLED GUEST INCENSE IS NOT DIVIDED IT IS ONLY PUT INTO A WRAPPER MARKED WITH AN ABBREVIATION OF THE CHINESE CHARACTER SIGNIFYING GUEST ACCORDINGLY
5727-47030-0054 WE HAVE A TOTAL OF THIRTEEN PACKAGES TO START WITH BUT THREE ARE TO BE USED IN THE PRELIMINARY SAMPLING OR EXPERIMENTING AS THE JAPANESE TERM IT AFTER THE FOLLOWING MANNER WE SHALL SUPPOSE THE GAME TO BE ARRANGED FOR A PARTY OF SIX
5727-47030-0055 THOUGH THERE IS NO RULE LIMITING THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS THE SIX TAKE THEIR PLACES IN LINE OR IN A HALF CIRCLE IF THE ROOM BE SMALL BUT THEY DO NOT SIT CLOSE TOGETHER FOR REASONS WHICH WILL PRESENTLY APPEAR THEN THE HOST OR THE PERSON APPOINTED TO ACT AS INCENSE BURNER
5727-47030-0056 KINDLES IT IN A CENSER AND PASSES THE CENSER TO THE GUEST OCCUPYING THE FIRST SEAT
5727-47030-0057 THE GUEST RECEIVES THE CENSER ACCORDING TO THE GRACEFUL ETIQUETTE REQUIRED IN THE KO KWAI INHALES THE PERFUME AND PASSES ON THE VESSEL TO HIS NEIGHBOR WHO RECEIVES IT IN LIKE MANNER AND PASSES IT TO THE THIRD GUEST WHO PRESENTS IT TO THE FOURTH AND SO ON
5727-47030-0058 IT IS RETURNED TO THE INCENSE BURNER
5727-47030-0059 BUT WITH THE GUEST INCENSE NO EXPERIMENT IS MADE THE PLAYER SHOULD BE ABLE TO REMEMBER THE DIFFERENT ODORS OF THE INCENSES TESTED AND HE IS EXPECTED TO IDENTIFY THE GUEST INCENSE AT THE PROPER TIME MERELY BY THE UNFAMILIAR QUALITY OF ITS FRAGRANCE
5727-47030-0060 THE BACKS ONLY OF THESE TABLETS ARE DECORATED AND THE DECORATION IS NEARLY ALWAYS A FLORAL DESIGN OF SOME SORT THUS ONE SET MIGHT BE DECORATED WITH CHRYSANTHEMUMS IN GOLD ANOTHER WITH TUFTS OF IRIS PLANTS ANOTHER WITH A SPRAY OF PLUM BLOSSOMS ET CETERA
5727-47030-0061 A BOX CALLED THE TABLET BOX IS PLACED BEFORE THE FIRST PLAYER AND ALL IS READY FOR THE REAL GAME THE INCENSE BURNER RETIRES BEHIND A LITTLE SCREEN SHUFFLES THE FLAT PACKAGES LIKE SO MANY CARDS TAKES THE UPPERMOST PREPARES ITS CONTENTS IN THE CENSER
5727-47030-0062 AND THEN RETURNING TO THE PARTY SENDS THE CENSER UPON ITS ROUND THIS TIME OF COURSE HE DOES NOT ANNOUNCE WHAT KIND OF INCENSE HE HAS USED AS THE CENSER PASSES FROM HAND TO HAND EACH PLAYER AFTER INHALING THE FUME PUTS INTO THE TABLET BOX
5727-47030-0063 ONE TABLET BEARING THAT MARK OR NUMBER WHICH HE SUPPOSES TO BE THE MARK OR NUMBER OF THE INCENSE HE HAS SMELLED IF FOR EXAMPLE HE THINKS THE INCENSE TO BE GUEST INCENSE
5727-47030-0064 HE PUTS INTO THE BOX A TABLET NUMBERED TWO WHEN THE ROUND IS OVER TABLET BOX AND CENSER ARE BOTH RETURNED TO THE INCENSE BURNER HE TAKES THE SIX TABLETS OUT OF THE BOX AND WRAPS THEM UP IN THE PAPER WHICH CONTAINED THE INCENSE GUESSED ABOUT THE TABLETS THEMSELVES
5727-47030-0065 WHEN ALL THE INCENSE HAS BEEN USED THE TABLETS ARE TAKEN OUT OF THEIR WRAPPINGS THE RECORD IS OFFICIALLY PUT INTO WRITING AND THE VICTOR OF THE DAY IS ANNOUNCED I HERE OFFER THE TRANSLATION OF SUCH A RECORD IT WILL SERVE TO EXPLAIN ALMOST AT A GLANCE ALL THE COMPLICATIONS OF THE GAME
5727-47030-0066 ACCORDING TO THIS RECORD THE PLAYER WHO USED THE TABLETS DECORATED WITH THE DESIGN CALLED YOUNG PINE MADE BUT TWO MISTAKES WHILE THE HOLDER OF THE WHITE LILY SET MADE ONLY ONE CORRECT GUESS
5727-47030-0067 BUT IT IS QUITE A FEAT TO MAKE TEN CORRECT JUDGMENTS IN SUCCESSION THE OLFACTORY NERVES ARE APT TO BECOME SOMEWHAT NUMBED LONG BEFORE THE GAME IS CONCLUDED AND THEREFORE IT IS CUSTOMARY DURING THE KO KWAI TO RINSE THE MOUTH AT INTERVALS WITH PURE VINEGAR
5727-47030-0068 THREE YOUNG BAMBOO
5727-47030-0069 RED PEONY GUEST
5727-47030-0070 THREE WHITE LILY ONE THREE ONE THREE TWO TWO ONE THREE GUEST TWO
5727-47030-0071 ONE YOUNG PINE THREE
5727-47030-0072 CHERRY BLOSSOM IN A MIST
