572-128861-0000 CHAPTER NINE WRECKAGE AND NOW COMES THE STRANGEST THING IN MY STORY YET PERHAPS IT IS NOT ALTOGETHER STRANGE I REMEMBER CLEARLY AND COLDLY AND VIVIDLY
572-128861-0001 ALL THAT I DID THAT DAY UNTIL THE TIME THAT I STOOD WEEPING AND PRAISING GOD UPON THE SUMMIT OF PRIMROSE HILL AND THEN I FORGET OF THE NEXT THREE DAYS I KNOW NOTHING I HAVE LEARNED SINCE THAT SO FAR FROM MY BEING THE FIRST DISCOVERER OF THE MARTIAN OVERTHROW
572-128861-0002 SEVERAL SUCH WANDERERS AS MYSELF HAD ALREADY DISCOVERED THIS ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT ONE MAN THE FIRST HAD GONE TO SAINT MARTIN'S LE GRAND AND WHILE I SHELTERED IN THE CABMEN'S HUT HAD CONTRIVED TO TELEGRAPH TO PARIS
572-128861-0003 THENCE THE JOYFUL NEWS HAD FLASHED ALL OVER THE WORLD A THOUSAND CITIES CHILLED BY GHASTLY APPREHENSIONS SUDDENLY FLASHED INTO FRANTIC ILLUMINATIONS THEY KNEW OF IT IN DUBLIN EDINBURGH MANCHESTER BIRMINGHAM
572-128861-0004 AT THE TIME WHEN I STOOD UPON THE VERGE OF THE PIT ALREADY MEN WEEPING WITH JOY AS I HAVE HEARD SHOUTING AND STAYING THEIR WORK TO SHAKE HANDS AND SHOUT WERE MAKING UP TRAINS EVEN AS NEAR AS CREWE TO DESCEND UPON LONDON
572-128861-0005 THE CHURCH BELLS THAT HAD CEASED A FORTNIGHT SINCE SUDDENLY CAUGHT THE NEWS UNTIL ALL ENGLAND WAS BELL RINGING MEN ON CYCLES LEAN FACED UNKEMPT SCORCHED ALONG EVERY COUNTRY LANE SHOUTING OF UNHOPED DELIVERANCE
572-128861-0006 SHOUTING TO GAUNT STARING FIGURES OF DESPAIR AND FOR THE FOOD ACROSS THE CHANNEL ACROSS THE IRISH SEA ACROSS THE ATLANTIC CORN BREAD AND MEAT WERE TEARING TO OUR RELIEF ALL THE SHIPPING IN THE WORLD SEEMED GOING LONDONWARD IN THOSE DAYS
572-128861-0007 BUT OF ALL THIS I HAVE NO MEMORY I DRIFTED A DEMENTED MAN I FOUND MYSELF IN A HOUSE OF KINDLY PEOPLE WHO HAD FOUND ME ON THE THIRD DAY WANDERING WEEPING AND RAVING THROUGH THE STREETS OF SAINT JOHN'S WOOD
572-128861-0008 THEY HAVE TOLD ME SINCE THAT I WAS SINGING SOME INSANE DOGGEREL ABOUT THE LAST MAN LEFT ALIVE HURRAH THE LAST MAN LEFT ALIVE
572-128861-0009 THESE PEOPLE WHOSE NAME MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO THEM I MAY NOT EVEN GIVE HERE NEVERTHELESS CUMBERED THEMSELVES WITH ME SHELTERED ME AND PROTECTED ME FROM MYSELF
572-128861-0010 APPARENTLY THEY HAD LEARNED SOMETHING OF MY STORY FROM ME DURING THE DAYS OF MY LAPSE VERY GENTLY WHEN MY MIND WAS ASSURED AGAIN DID THEY BREAK TO ME WHAT THEY HAD LEARNED OF THE FATE OF LEATHERHEAD
572-128861-0011 TWO DAYS AFTER I WAS IMPRISONED IT HAD BEEN DESTROYED WITH EVERY SOUL IN IT BY A MARTIAN HE HAD SWEPT IT OUT OF EXISTENCE AS IT SEEMED WITHOUT ANY PROVOCATION AS A BOY MIGHT CRUSH AN ANT HILL
572-128861-0012 IN THE MERE WANTONNESS OF POWER I WAS A LONELY MAN AND THEY WERE VERY KIND TO ME I WAS A LONELY MAN AND A SAD ONE AND THEY BORE WITH ME I REMAINED WITH THEM FOUR DAYS AFTER MY RECOVERY
572-128861-0013 ALL THAT TIME I FELT A VAGUE A GROWING CRAVING TO LOOK ONCE MORE ON WHATEVER REMAINED OF THE LITTLE LIFE THAT SEEMED SO HAPPY AND BRIGHT IN MY PAST IT WAS A MERE HOPELESS DESIRE TO FEAST UPON MY MISERY THEY DISSUADED ME
572-128861-0014 THEY DID ALL THEY COULD TO DIVERT ME FROM THIS MORBIDITY BUT AT LAST I COULD RESIST THE IMPULSE NO LONGER AND PROMISING FAITHFULLY TO RETURN TO THEM AND PARTING AS I WILL CONFESS FROM THESE FOUR DAY FRIENDS WITH TEARS
572-128861-0015 I WENT OUT AGAIN INTO THE STREETS THAT HAD LATELY BEEN SO DARK AND STRANGE AND EMPTY ALREADY THEY WERE BUSY WITH RETURNING PEOPLE IN PLACES EVEN THERE WERE SHOPS OPEN AND I SAW A DRINKING FOUNTAIN RUNNING WATER
572-128861-0016 I REMEMBER HOW MOCKINGLY BRIGHT THE DAY SEEMED AS I WENT BACK ON MY MELANCHOLY PILGRIMAGE TO THE LITTLE HOUSE AT WOKING HOW BUSY THE STREETS AND VIVID THE MOVING LIFE ABOUT ME SO MANY PEOPLE WERE ABROAD EVERYWHERE BUSIED IN A THOUSAND ACTIVITIES
572-128861-0017 THAT IT SEEMED INCREDIBLE THAT ANY GREAT PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION COULD HAVE BEEN SLAIN BUT THEN I NOTICED HOW YELLOW WERE THE SKINS OF THE PEOPLE I MET HOW SHAGGY THE HAIR OF THE MEN HOW LARGE AND BRIGHT THEIR EYES
572-128861-0018 AND THAT EVERY OTHER MAN STILL WORE HIS DIRTY RAGS THEIR FACES SEEMED ALL WITH ONE OF TWO EXPRESSIONS A LEAPING EXULTATION AND ENERGY OR A GRIM RESOLUTION SAVE FOR THE EXPRESSION OF THE FACES
572-128861-0019 LONDON SEEMED A CITY OF TRAMPS THE VESTRIES WERE INDISCRIMINATELY DISTRIBUTING BREAD SENT US BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT THE RIBS OF THE FEW HORSES SHOWED DISMALLY HAGGARD SPECIAL CONSTABLES WITH WHITE BADGES STOOD AT THE CORNERS OF EVERY STREET
572-128861-0020 I SAW LITTLE OF THE MISCHIEF WROUGHT BY THE MARTIANS UNTIL I REACHED WELLINGTON STREET AND THERE I SAW THE RED WEED CLAMBERING OVER THE BUTTRESSES OF WATERLOO BRIDGE AT THE CORNER OF THE BRIDGE TOO I SAW ONE OF THE COMMON CONTRASTS OF THAT GROTESQUE TIME
572-128861-0021 TRANSFIXED BY A STICK THAT KEPT IT IN PLACE IT WAS THE PLACARD OF THE FIRST NEWSPAPER TO RESUME PUBLICATION THE DAILY MAIL I BOUGHT A COPY FOR A BLACKENED SHILLING I FOUND IN MY POCKET
572-128861-0022 BUT THE SOLITARY COMPOSITOR WHO DID THE THING HAD AMUSED HIMSELF BY MAKING A GROTESQUE SCHEME OF ADVERTISEMENT STEREO ON THE BACK PAGE THE MATTER HE PRINTED WAS EMOTIONAL THE NEWS ORGANISATION HAD NOT AS YET FOUND ITS WAY BACK
572-128861-0023 I LEARNED NOTHING FRESH EXCEPT THAT ALREADY IN ONE WEEK THE EXAMINATION OF THE MARTIAN MECHANISMS HAD YIELDED ASTONISHING RESULTS AMONG OTHER THINGS THE ARTICLE ASSURED ME WHAT I DID NOT BELIEVE AT THE TIME THAT THE SECRET OF FLYING WAS DISCOVERED
572-128861-0024 AT WATERLOO I FOUND THE FREE TRAINS THAT WERE TAKING PEOPLE TO THEIR HOMES THE FIRST RUSH WAS ALREADY OVER THERE WERE FEW PEOPLE IN THE TRAIN AND I WAS IN NO MOOD FOR CASUAL CONVERSATION I GOT A COMPARTMENT TO MYSELF
572-128861-0025 AND SAT WITH FOLDED ARMS LOOKING GREYLY AT THE SUNLIT DEVASTATION THAT FLOWED PAST THE WINDOWS AND JUST OUTSIDE THE TERMINUS THE TRAIN JOLTED OVER TEMPORARY RAILS AND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RAILWAY THE HOUSES WERE BLACKENED RUINS
572-128861-0026 TO CLAPHAM JUNCTION THE FACE OF LONDON WAS GRIMY WITH POWDER OF THE BLACK SMOKE IN SPITE OF TWO DAYS OF THUNDERSTORMS AND RAIN AND AT CLAPHAM JUNCTION THE LINE HAD BEEN WRECKED AGAIN THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF OUT OF WORK CLERKS AND SHOPMEN
572-128861-0027 WORKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE CUSTOMARY NAVVIES AND WE WERE JOLTED OVER A HASTY RELAYING ALL DOWN THE LINE FROM THERE THE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY WAS GAUNT AND UNFAMILIAR WIMBLEDON PARTICULARLY HAD SUFFERED
572-128861-0028 WALTON BY VIRTUE OF ITS UNBURNED PINE WOODS SEEMED THE LEAST HURT OF ANY PLACE ALONG THE LINE
572-128861-0029 IN APPEARANCE BETWEEN BUTCHER'S MEAT AND PICKLED CABBAGE THE SURREY PINE WOODS WERE TOO DRY HOWEVER FOR THE FESTOONS OF THE RED CLIMBER BEYOND WIMBLEDON WITHIN SIGHT OF THE LINE IN CERTAIN NURSERY GROUNDS
572-128861-0030 WERE THE HEAPED MASSES OF EARTH ABOUT THE SIXTH CYLINDER A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE STANDING ABOUT IT AND SOME SAPPERS WERE BUSY IN THE MIDST OF IT
572-128861-0031 THE NURSERY GROUNDS WERE EVERYWHERE CRIMSON WITH THE WEED
572-128861-0032 AND VERY PAINFUL TO THE EYE
572-128861-0033 TO THE BLUE GREEN SOFTNESS OF THE EASTWARD HILLS THE LINE ON THE LONDON SIDE OF WOKING STATION WAS STILL UNDERGOING REPAIR SO I DESCENDED AT BYFLEET STATION AND TOOK THE ROAD TO MAYBURY
572-128861-0034 AND ON BY THE SPOT WHERE THE MARTIAN HAD APPEARED TO ME IN THE THUNDERSTORM HERE MOVED BY CURIOSITY I TURNED ASIDE TO FIND AMONG A TANGLE OF RED FRONDS THE WARPED AND BROKEN DOG CART
572-128861-0035 FOR A TIME I STOOD REGARDING THESE VESTIGES THEN I RETURNED THROUGH THE PINE WOOD NECK HIGH WITH RED WEED HERE AND THERE TO FIND THE LANDLORD OF THE SPOTTED DOG HAD ALREADY FOUND BURIAL AND SO CAME HOME PAST THE COLLEGE ARMS
572-128861-0036 A MAN STANDING AT AN OPEN COTTAGE DOOR GREETED ME BY NAME AS I PASSED I LOOKED AT MY HOUSE WITH A QUICK FLASH OF HOPE THAT FADED IMMEDIATELY THE DOOR HAD BEEN FORCED IT WAS UNFAST AND WAS OPENING SLOWLY AS I APPROACHED
572-128861-0037 IT SLAMMED AGAIN THE CURTAINS OF MY STUDY FLUTTERED OUT OF THE OPEN WINDOW FROM WHICH I AND THE ARTILLERYMAN HAD WATCHED THE DAWN NO ONE HAD CLOSED IT SINCE THE SMASHED BUSHES WERE JUST AS I HAD LEFT THEM NEARLY FOUR WEEKS AGO
572-128861-0038 I STUMBLED INTO THE HALL AND THE HOUSE FELT EMPTY THE STAIR CARPET WAS RUFFLED AND DISCOLOURED WHERE I HAD CROUCHED SOAKED TO THE SKIN FROM THE THUNDERSTORM THE NIGHT OF THE CATASTROPHE
572-128861-0039 OUR MUDDY FOOTSTEPS I SAW STILL WENT UP THE STAIRS I FOLLOWED THEM TO MY STUDY AND FOUND LYING ON MY WRITING TABLE STILL WITH THE SELENITE PAPER WEIGHT UPON IT THE SHEET OF WORK I HAD LEFT ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE OPENING OF THE CYLINDER
572-128861-0040 FOR A SPACE I STOOD READING OVER MY ABANDONED ARGUMENTS IT WAS A PAPER ON THE PROBABLE DEVELOPMENT OF MORAL IDEAS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CIVILISING PROCESS AND THE LAST SENTENCE WAS THE OPENING OF A PROPHECY
572-128861-0041 THE SENTENCE ENDED ABRUPTLY I REMEMBERED MY INABILITY TO FIX MY MIND THAT MORNING SCARCELY A MONTH GONE BY AND HOW I HAD BROKEN OFF TO GET MY DAILY CHRONICLE FROM THE NEWSBOY I REMEMBERED HOW I WENT DOWN TO THE GARDEN GATE AS HE CAME ALONG
572-128861-0042 THERE WERE THE MUTTON AND THE BREAD BOTH FAR GONE NOW IN DECAY AND A BEER BOTTLE OVERTURNED JUST AS I AND THE ARTILLERYMAN HAD LEFT THEM MY HOME WAS DESOLATE I PERCEIVED THE FOLLY OF THE FAINT HOPE I HAD CHERISHED SO LONG
572-128861-0043 AND THEN A STRANGE THING OCCURRED IT IS NO USE SAID A VOICE THE HOUSE IS DESERTED NO ONE HAS BEEN HERE THESE TEN DAYS DO NOT STAY HERE TO TORMENT YOURSELF NO ONE ESCAPED BUT YOU
572-128861-0044 I WAS STARTLED HAD I SPOKEN MY THOUGHT ALOUD I TURNED AND THE FRENCH WINDOW WAS OPEN BEHIND ME I MADE A STEP TO IT AND STOOD LOOKING OUT AND THERE
572-128861-0045 AMAZED AND AFRAID EVEN AS I STOOD AMAZED AND AFRAID WERE MY COUSIN AND MY WIFE MY WIFE WHITE AND TEARLESS SHE GAVE A FAINT CRY I CAME SHE SAID
