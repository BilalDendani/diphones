5101-40462-0000 WHEREIN WE MEET SHARKS ALLIGATORS AND A VERY TOUGH PROBLEM IN WRECKING TIMMANS WHOM I USED TO CALL THE STUDENT DIVER BECAUSE OF HIS KEEN OBSERVATION AND CAPACITY FOR WONDER
5101-40462-0001 LEANED AGAINST THE STEP LADDER THAT REACHED DOWN FROM HATCH TO CABIN ON THE DUNDERBERG AND REMARKED WHILE THE OTHERS LISTENED I DID A QUEER JOB OF DIVING ONCE DOWN INTO THE HOLD OF A STEAMSHIP A NATIONAL LINER
5101-40462-0002 THAT LAY IN HER DOCK BLAZING WITH ELECTRIC LIGHTS AND DRY AS A BONE JUST THE SAME I NEEDED MY SUIT WHEN I GOT DOWN INTO HER
5101-40462-0003 SOME QUEER CARGO SUGGESTED ATKINSON THAT'S IT SHE WAS LOADED WITH CAUSTIC SODA OR WHATEVER THEY MAKE BLEACHING POWDER OF BARRELS AND BARRELS OF IT WITH THE HEADS BROKE IN AFTER A STORM
5101-40462-0004 AND IT WASN'T GOOD STUFF TO BREATHE I CAN TELL YOU FIRST THEY SET MEN SHOVELING IT OUT WITH SPONGES IN THEIR MOUTHS AGAINST THE DUST AND GASES BUT ONE MAN COUGHED SO HARD HE TORE SOMETHING IN HIS LUNGS OR HEAD AND DIED THEN THEY SENT FOR A DIVER
5101-40462-0005 THAT WAS ME AND I WORKED HOURS DOWN THERE HOISTING AND SHOVELING LIKE I WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BAY ONLY THERE WAS NO WATER TO CARRY THE WEIGHT SAY BUT WASN'T THAT SUIT HEAVY AND WHEN I LOOKED OUT THROUGH MY HELMET GLASSES
5101-40462-0006 IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS DIGGING THROUGH A SNOW FIELD WITH SUCH A TERRIBLE DAZZLE IT MADE MY EYES ACHE TO LOOK AT
5101-40462-0007 SAID I DEPENDS ON WHAT WATER IT IS ANSWERED TIMMANS ALL RIVERS AROUND NEW YORK ARE BLACK AS INK TWENTY FEET DOWN REMARKED ATKINSON I KNOW THEY ARE SAID TIMMANS BUT I'VE SEEN DIFFERENT RIVERS
5101-40462-0008 WHEN I WAS DIVING OFF THE KENNEBEC'S MOUTH FIVE MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE SEGUIN LIGHT WE WERE GETTING UP THE WRECK OF THE MARY LEE THEN GENTLEMEN
5101-40462-0009 I LOOKED THROUGH AS BEAUTIFUL CLEAR WATER AS YOU COULD FIND IN A DRUG STORE FILTER WHY IT REMINDED ME OF THE WEST INDIES I COULD SEE PLAINLY FOR WELL
5101-40462-0010 CERTAINLY SEVENTY FIVE FEET OVER SWAYING KELP WEED EIGHT FEET HIGH WITH BLOOD RED LEAVES AS BIG AS A BARREL ALL DOTTED OVER WITH BLACK SPOTS THERE WERE ACRES AND ACRES OF IT SWARMING WITH ROCK CRABS AND LOBSTERS
5101-40462-0011 AND ALL KINDS OF FISH ANY SHARKS SAID I HANSEN AND ATKINSON SMILED FOR THIS IS A QUESTION ALWAYS PUT TO DIVERS WHO USUALLY HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THEY NEVER EVEN SAW A SHARK
5101-40462-0012 NOT SO TIMMANS I HAD AN EXPERIENCE WITH A SHARK HE ANSWERED GRAVELY BUT IT WASN'T UP IN MAINE IT WAS WHILE WE WERE TRYING TO SAVE A THREE THOUSAND TON STEAMER OF THE HAMBURG AMERICAN PACKET COMPANY
5101-40462-0013 WRECKED ON A BAR IN THE MAGDALENA RIVER UNITED STATES OF COLOMBIA I'D BEEN WORKING FOR DAYS PATCHING HER KEEL HUNG ON A SWINGING SHELF WE'D LOWERED ALONG HER SIDE
5101-40462-0014 AND EVERY TIME I WENT DOWN I SAW SWARMS OF RED SNAPPERS AND BUTTERFISH UNDER MY SHELF DARTING AFTER THE REFUSE I'D SCRAPE OFF HER PLATES AND THERE WERE BIG JEWFISH TOO AND I USED TO HARPOON EM FOR THE MEN TO EAT
5101-40462-0015 WELL ON ONE PARTICULAR DAY I NOTICED A SUDDEN SHADOW AGAINST THE LIGHT
5101-40462-0016 NOT SUCH AN ENORMOUS ONE BUT TWELVE FEET LONG ANYHOW BIG ENOUGH TO MAKE ME UNEASY HE SWAM SLOWLY AROUND ME AND THEN KEPT PERFECTLY STILL
5101-40462-0017 THEY RIGGED UP A WIRE RAILWAY FROM WRECK TO SHORE AND SLID OFF A VALUABLE CARGO OF ALPACA SILKS AND BEER BIT BY BIT ALONG THE WIRE TO LAND
5101-40462-0018 BUT PRESENTLY THIS CURRENT SWEEPING DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS GREW TOO SWIFT FOR THE WRECKING TUG AND SHE IN TURN WAS DRAGGED DOWN STREAM AGAINST ALL THE STRENGTH OF HER ENGINES AND SAW HERSELF THREATENED WITH DESTRUCTION ON THE BAR
5101-40462-0019 ORDERED THE HAWSER CUT AND THIRTY NINE MEN OF THE WRECKING CREW WERE LEFT TO THEIR FATE ON THE ABANDONED WRECK THEIR ADVENTURES ALONE WOULD MAKE A THRILLING CHAPTER BUT THEY WERE RESCUED FINALLY FROM THE HALF SINKING STEAMER
5101-40462-0020 THEN WEEKS PASSED WHILE THE WRECKING CREW WORKED AT PATCHING THE STEAMER'S HOLES SO THAT SHE WOULD FLOAT AND EVERY DAY TIMMANS WENT DOWN IN HIS SUIT AND DID BLACKSMITH WORK AND CARPENTER WORK ON HER TORN PLATES AND BEAMS
5101-40462-0021 IN CONSTANT DANGER OF BEING CRUSHED IN THE DEEP SAND TROUGH SHE ROCKED AND SLID IN SOMETIMES THE WHOLE IRON HULL BEATEN AGAINST BY THE OCEAN
5101-40462-0022 AND TO BE CAUGHT BETWEEN HER SIDE AND THAT WALL
5101-40462-0023 DIVING SUIT AND MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN CRUSHED LIKE AN EGG SHELL FINALLY WHEN SHE WAS READY THEY MADE FAST A SIXTEEN INCH HAWSER AND PUT ON FULL STEAM TO PULL HER OFF INTO DEEP WATER
5101-40462-0024 OFF SHE CAME AND ALL WAS GOING WELL WITH THE TOWING WHEN A FIERCE TROPICAL STORM CAME UPON THEM AND THE STEAMER TURNED BROADSIDE TO ITS FURY AND THE GREAT HAWSER SNAPPED LIKE A KITE STRING AND BACK SHE WENT ON A CORAL REEF
5101-40462-0025 ONCE MORE THEY BEGAN AT THE BEGINNING AND IN TIME HAD ANOTHER HAWSER READY AND TRIED AGAIN THIS TIME THE HAWSER PARTED BY GRINDING ON THE BEACH AS THEY DRAGGED HER THEN AFTER LONG DELAY
5101-40462-0026 HAD NOT A SAWFISH SENT BY THE EVIL POWER THAT THWARTED THEM THRUST ITS JAGGED WEAPON THROUGH THE HAWSER STRANDS
