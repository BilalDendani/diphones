1370-138531-0000 CHAPTER FIVE REAL LIVE PIRATES AFTER NEATLY AND CAREFULLY TURNING UP THE BOTTOMS OF HIS TROUSERS SO THAT THEY SHOULD NOT GET WET THE FALSE HARE BOUNDED ON A ROCK THAT ROSE OUT OF THE WATER A FEW FEET FROM SHORE
1370-138531-0001 AND STOOD READY TO DIRECT THE LANDING OF THE BOAT THERE WAS SOME SENSE IN THIS FOR CERTAINLY NEITHER OF THE TWO MICE WAS WHAT COULD BE CALLED GOOD OARSMEN ONE OF THEM HAD JUST UNSHIPPED THE LITTLE SAIL AND NOT SEEMING TO KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO WITH IT
1370-138531-0002 HAD CUT IT LOOSE FROM THE OAR THAT SERVED AS A MAST AND WRAPPED IT ROUND AND ROUND HIS BODY TYING HIMSELF TIGHTLY WITH A PIECE OF STRING RUDOLF THOUGHT HE HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE SEEN PEOPLE IN A BOAT DO SO MANY QUEER AND UNNECESSARY THINGS
1370-138531-0003 IN SO SHORT A TIME AS THOSE TWO MICE DID THEY WOULD STOP ROWING EVERY FEW MINUTES AND BEGIN SWEEPING OUT THE FLOOR OF THEIR BOAT WITH A SMALL BROOM DUSTING SEATS CUSHIONS AND OAR LOCKS WITH A LITTLE FEATHER DUSTER TIED WITH A PINK RIBBON THEN AFTER A FEW RAPID NERVOUS STROKES AT THE OARS
1370-138531-0004 ONE OR THE OTHER OF THEM WOULD PULL HIS BLADE OUT OF THE WATER AND POLISH IT ANXIOUSLY WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF AS IF THE IMPORTANT THING WAS TO KEEP IT DRY THEY WOULD PROBABLY NEVER HAVE REACHED LAND THAT DAY IF THIS HAD DEPENDED ON THEIR OWN EFFORTS
1370-138531-0005 BUT LUCKILY THE BREEZE WAS BLOWING THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ALL THIS TIME THE FALSE HARE HAD BEEN WAITING ON THE ROCK AND NOW AS THE BOAT WAS ALMOST WITHIN REACH HE BEGAN LEAPING UP AND DOWN CLAPPING HIS PAWS AND CALLING OUT IN THE HEARTIEST TONES
1370-138531-0006 YOU'RE A PAIR OF SWELL OLD SEA DOGS YOU ARE ONLY DON'T HURT YOURSELVES YOU KNOW
1370-138531-0007 WORK IT SEEMED AS IF THE WHITE MICE KNEW THE FALSE HARE AND THE VALUE OF HIS REMARKS FOR THEY MADE NO ATTEMPT TO ANSWER HIM BUT ONLY LOOKED MORE AND MORE FRIGHTENED AND UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN THEIR BOAT WAS AT LAST BEACHED THEY JUMPED OUT OF IT TURNED THEIR BACKS TO THE REST OF THE PARTY
1370-138531-0008 AND STANDING AS CLOSE TOGETHER AS THEY COULD GET
1370-138531-0009 YES EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD GROWN A GREAT DEAL AND HAD DISGUISED THEMSELVES BY THE SIMPLE METHOD OF LICKING THE CHOCOLATE OFF EACH OTHER RUDOLF AND ANN HOPED PETER WOULD NOT NOTICE IT BUT NOTHING OF THE SORT EVER ESCAPED HIM
1370-138531-0010 LOOKED AT THEM LONG AND EARNESTLY AND SAID
1370-138531-0011 ANN SHOOK HER HEAD AT PETER HUSH SHE WHISPERED YOU MUSTN'T BE RUDE TO THEM WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO LEND US THEIR BOAT SO KINDLY THEN SHE ASKED IN A LOUD VOICE HOPING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT WHO IS GOING TO ROW WILL YOU MISTER FALSE HARE
1370-138531-0012 WHY CERTAINLY DEARIE I ADORE ROWING SAID THE FALSE HARE SWEETLY THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO RUDOLF AND I WILL LOOK AFTER PETER HE IS ALWAYS SO APT TO FALL OUT OF A BOAT
1370-138531-0013 THEY ALL GOT INTO THE BOAT RUDOLF TOOK THE OARS ANN SAT IN THE BOW WITH PETER BESIDE HER AND THE FALSE HARE SETTLED HIMSELF COMFORTABLY IN THE STERN WITH A MOUSE SQUEEZED ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM HE WANTED TO PET THEM A LITTLE SO HE SAID
1370-138531-0014 BUT FROM THE STRAINED EXPRESSIONS ON THEIR FACES AND THE STARTLED SQUEAKS THEY GAVE FROM TIME TO TIME IT SEEMED AS IF THEY WERE HARDLY ENJOYING HIS ATTENTIONS THE CHILDREN LOVED BEING ON THE WATER BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE
1370-138531-0015 AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY HAPPY NOW IF THE FALSE HARE HAD NOT HAD QUITE SO MANY NICE COMPLIMENTS TO MAKE TO RUDOLF ON HIS ROWING AND IF THE WHITE MICE HAD NOT COMPLAINED SO BITTERLY OF THEM ALL FOR SITTING ALL OVER THE BOAT CUSHIONS AND WETTING THE NICE DRY OARS
1370-138531-0016 THEY WERE ENJOYING THEMSELVES VERY MUCH IN SPITE OF THIS WHEN SUDDENLY ANN WHO HAD VERY SHARP EYES CALLED OUT SAIL AHEAD AT FIRST RUDOLF THOUGHT SHE HAD SAID THIS JUST BECAUSE IT SOUNDED WELL
1370-138531-0017 BUT ON TURNING HIS HEAD HE SAW FOR HIMSELF A SMALL BOAT HEADING TOWARD THEM AS FAST AS IT COULD COME A MOMENT MORE AND THE CHILDREN COULD SEE THE BLACK FLAG FLOATING AT ITS MASTHEAD OH OH SCREAMED ANN
1370-138531-0018 SHUDDERING ALL OVER TO THE TIPS OF HIS WHISKERS IF THERE'S ONE THING I DO DOTE ON IT IS PIRATES DEAR OLD THINGS AS FOR THE TWO WHITE MICE AFTER ONE GLANCE AT THE SHIP THEY GAVE TWO LITTLE SHRIEKS
1370-138531-0019 AND HID THEIR FACES IN THEIR PAWS RUDOLF SHIPPED HIS OARS WHILE HE LOOSENED HIS SWORD I SHALL BE PREPARED TO FIGHT SAID HE THOUGH I AM AFRAID WE MUST MAKE UP OUR MINDS TO BEING CAPTURED OUR ENEMY'S BOAT IS NOT SO LARGE IT'S NOT MUCH MORE THAN A CATBOAT
1370-138531-0020 BUT THERE ARE ONLY FOUR OF US AS THE MICE DON'T COUNT AND I SUPPOSE THERE MUST BE AT LEAST A DOZEN OF THE PIRATES THE FALSE HARE SMILED
1370-138531-0021 AND SUCH NICE ONES HE MURMURED SUCH GENTLE WELL BEHAVED WELL BROUGHT UP POLITE PIRATES JUST THE SORT YOUR DEAR PARENTS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU MEET THOSE FELLOWS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SHOOTING STABBING MAST HEADING OR PLANK WALKING
1370-138531-0022 ANN TURNED PALE AT THE FALSE HARE'S WORDS BUT RUDOLF ONLY LAUGHED WHAT LUCK HE EXCLAIMED I'M NINE YEARS OLD AND I'VE NEVER SEEN A REAL LIVE PIRATE AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHEN I EVER WILL AGAIN I WOULDN'T MISS THIS FOR ANYTHING
1370-138531-0023 THEN AS HE SAW HOW REALLY WORRIED HIS LITTLE SISTER LOOKED HE ADDED CHEERFULLY THEY MAY SAIL RIGHT PAST WITHOUT SPEAKING TO US YOU KNOW BUT THIS WAS NOT TO BE THE CASE
1370-138531-0024 NEARER AND NEARER CAME THE PIRATE CRAFT UNTIL AT LAST THE CHILDREN COULD SEE PAINTED IN BLACK LETTERS ON HER SIDE HER NAME THE MERRY MOUSER A GROUP OF PIRATES WAS GATHERED AT THE RAIL STARING AT THE ROWBOAT THROUGH THEIR GLASSES
1370-138531-0025 THERE WAS NO MISTAKE ABOUT THESE FELLOWS BEING PIRATES THAT WAS EASY ENOUGH TO SEE FROM THEIR QUEER BRIGHT COLORED CLOTHES AND THE NUMBER OF WEAPONS THEY CARRIED EVEN IF THE UGLY BLACK FLAG HAD NOT BEEN FLOATING OVER THEIR HEADS AT THE BOW STOOD HE WHO WAS EVIDENTLY THE PIRATE CHIEF
1370-138531-0026 HE WAS DRESSED IN SOME KIND OF TIGHT GRAY AND WHITE STRIPED SUIT WITH A RED SASH TIED ROUND HIS WAIST STUCK FULL OF SHINY BARRELED PISTOLS AND LONG BRIGHT BLADED KNIVES A RED TURBAN DECORATED HIS HEAD AND UNDER IT HIS BROWS MET IN THE FIERCEST KIND OF FROWN
1370-138531-0027 HIS ARMS WERE FOLDED ON HIS BREAST AS RUDOLF LOOKED AT THIS FELLOW HE BEGAN TO HAVE THE QUEEREST FEELING THAT SOMEWHERE SOMEHOW UNDER VERY DIFFERENT CONDITIONS
1370-138531-0028 JUST AT THAT INSTANT HE HEARD THE SOUND OF A STRUGGLE BEHIND HIM
1370-138531-0029 AND BREAKING LOOSE FROM ANN'S HOLD HE STOOD UP AND LEANED SO FAR OVER THE SIDE OF THE BOAT THAT HE LOST HIS BALANCE AND FELL INTO THE WATER ANN SCREAMED THE FALSE HARE I AM ASHAMED TO SAY MERELY YAWNED AND KEPT HIS PAWS IN HIS POCKETS RUDOLF HAD KICKED OFF HIS SHOES AND WAS READY TO JUMP IN AFTER PETER
1370-138531-0030 WHEN HE SAW THAT QUICK AS A FLASH ON AN ORDER FROM THEIR CHIEF THE PIRATES HAD LOWERED A LONG ROPE WITH SOMETHING BOBBING AT THE END OF IT PETER WHEN HE CAME TO THE SURFACE SEIZED THIS ROPE AND WAS RAPIDLY HAULED ON BOARD THE PIRATE SHIP ANN CAME NEAR FALLING OVERBOARD HERSELF IN HER EXCITEMENT
1370-138531-0031 OH RUDDY RUDDY SHE BEGGED LET'S SURRENDER RIGHT AWAY QUICK WE CAN'T LEAVE POOR DARLING PETER TO BE CARRIED OFF BY THOSE TERRIBLE CATS CATS SAID RUDOLF STARING STUPIDLY AT THE PIRATES WHY SO THEY ARE CATS ANN
1370-138531-0032 SOMEHOW I HADN'T NOTICED THAT BEFORE BUT LOOK THEY ARE SENDING A BOAT TO US NOW IN A SMALL BOAT WHICH HAD BEEN TOWED BEHIND THE CATBOAT A COUPLE OF PIRATES BIG ROUGH LOOKING FELLOWS WERE SCULLING RAPIDLY TOWARD THE CHILDREN
1370-138531-0033 CATS INDEED THEY WERE BUT SUCH CATS AS ANN AND RUDOLF HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE SO BIG AND BLACK AND BOLD WERE THEY THEIR TEETH SO SHARP AND WHITE THEIR EYES SO ROUND AND YELLOW ONE HAD A RED SASH AND ONE A GREEN
1370-138531-0034 AND EACH CARRIED KNIVES AND PISTOLS ENOUGH TO SET UP A SHOP SURRENDER THEY CRIED IN A BUSINESSLIKE KIND OF WAY AS THEY LAID HOLD OF THE BOW OF THE ROWBOAT OR HAVE YOUR THROATS CUT JUST AS YOU LIKE YOU KNOW OF COURSE THE CHILDREN DIDN'T LIKE
1370-138531-0035 AND THEN AS ANN SAID THEY HAD TO REMEMBER PETER MUCH AGAINST HIS WILL RUDOLF WAS NOW FORCED TO SURRENDER HIS BELOVED SWORD THE FALSE HARE HANDED OVER ALL HIS BELONGINGS HIS JEWELRY HIS SUIT CASE AND HIS LITTLE UMBRELLA
1370-138531-0036 BUT HIS VOICE CRACKED AND ANN AND RUDOLF NOTICED THAT THE TIP OF HIS NOSE HAD TURNED QUITE PALE THE PRISONERS WERE QUICKLY TRANSFERRED TO THE OTHER BOAT AND THE PIRATE WITH THE GREEN SASH TOOK THE OARS JUST AS ALL WAS READY FOR THE START THE CAT IN RED CRIED HOLD ON A MINUTE GROWLER
1370-138531-0037 I'LL JUST JUMP BACK INTO THEIR OLD TUB TO SEE IF WE'VE LEFT ANY VALLYBLES BEHIND ALL RIGHT PROWLER IT WAS THEN AND ONLY THEN THAT RUDOLF AND ANN REMEMBERED THE TWO WHITE MICE THE LAST TIME THEY HAD NOTICED THEM WAS AT THE MOMENT OF PETER'S DUCKING
1370-138531-0038 WHEN IN THEIR EXCITEMENT THE FOOLISH CREATURES HAD HIDDEN THEIR FACES ON EACH OTHER'S SHOULDERS ROLLED THEMSELVES INTO A KIND OF BALL AND STOWED THEMSELVES UNDER A SEAT PROWLER LEAPED INTO THE LITTLE BOAT WHICH THE PIRATES HAD FASTENED BY A TOW ROPE TO THEIR OWN
1370-138531-0039 AND DURING HIS SEARCH HE KEPT HIS BACK TURNED TO HIS COMPANIONS HE WAS GONE BUT A MOMENT AND WHEN HE RETURNED HIS WHISKERS WERE VERY SHINY AND HE WAS LOOKING EXTREMELY JOLLY AS HE HUMMED A SNATCH OF A PIRATE SONG FIND ANYTHING
1370-138531-0040 IF YOU DID AND DON'T FORK IT OUT BEFORE THE CHIEF YOU'LL CATCH IT TWILL BE AS MUCH AS YOUR NINE LIVES ARE WORTH OH TWAS NOTHING NOTHING OF ANY IMPORTANCE ANSWERED PROWLER AIRILY RUDOLF AND ANN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER BUT NEITHER OF THEM SPOKE
1370-138531-0041 BOTH THE PIRATE CATS NOW SETTLED TO THE OARS AND THE BOAT SKIMMED ALONG THE WATER IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MERRY MOUSER AS THEY DREW ALONGSIDE GROWLER MUTTERED IN A NOT UNFRIENDLY WHISPER LOOK HERE YOUNGSTERS HERE'S A WORD OF ADVICE THAT MAY SAVE YOU YOUR SKINS
1370-138531-0042 DON'T SHOW ANY CHEEK NOT TO ME OR PROWLER WE'RE THE MATES AND ABOVE ALL NOT TO THE CHIEF WHAT IS YOUR CHIEF'S NAME MISTER GROWLER DEAR SIR ASKED ANN TIMIDLY GROWLER FLASHED HIS WHITE TEETH AT HER
1370-138531-0043 THEN HE LOOKED AT PROWLER AND BOTH MATES REPEATED TOGETHER AS IF THEY WERE SAYING A LESSON THE NAME OF OUR ILLUSTRIOUS CHIEF IS CAPTAIN MITTENS MITTENS THE PITILESS PIRATE MITTENS THE MONSTER OF THE MAIN WHY
