3665-8587-0000 SOMETHING THAT I CLASSED FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON WITH THE DARK AND IGNORANT SORT OF WORDS SUCH AS OBI AND HOODOO
3665-8587-0001 I COULDN'T FOR THE LIFE OF ME HAVE THOUGHT OF HIM AS BEING CALLED ANYTHING ELSE THE FIRST IMPRESSION THAT YOU GOT OF HIS HEAD WAS THAT IT WAS A PATCHWORK OF BLACK AND WHITE BLACK BUSHY HAIR AND SHORT WHITE BEARD OR ELSE THE OTHER WAY ABOUT
3665-8587-0002 SO THAT IF YOU SAW HIM IN THE GLOOM A DIM PATCH OF WHITE SHOWED DOWN ONE SIDE OF HIS HEAD AND DARK TUFTS CROPPED UP HERE AND THERE IN HIS BEARD HIS EYEBROWS ALONE WERE ENTIRELY BLACK WITH A LITTLE SPROUTING OF HAIR ALMOST JOINING THEM AND PERHAPS HIS SKIN HELPED TO MAKE ME THINK OF NEGROES
3665-8587-0003 FOR IT WAS VERY DARK OF THE DARK BROWN THAT ALWAYS SEEMS TO HAVE MORE THAN A HINT OF GREEN BEHIND IT HIS FOREHEAD WAS LOW AND SCORED ACROSS WITH DEEP HORIZONTAL FURROWS WE NEVER KNEW WHEN HE WAS GOING TO TURN UP ON A JOB
3665-8587-0004 WE MIGHT NOT HAVE SEEN HIM FOR WEEKS BUT HIS FACE WAS ALWAYS AS LIKELY AS NOT TO APPEAR OVER THE EDGE OF A CRANE PLATFORM JUST WHEN THAT MARVELLOUS MECHANICAL INTUITION OF HIS WAS BADLY NEEDED HE WASN'T CERTIFICATED
3665-8587-0005 AND LAUGHED OUTRIGHT AT LOGARITHMS AND OUR LABORIOUS METHODS OF GETTING OUT QUANTITIES
3665-8587-0006 A HOPELESS LOOKING SMASH MYSELF I'M CERTIFICATED TWICE OR THREE TIMES OVER BUT I CAN ONLY ASSURE YOU THAT I WANTED TO KICK MYSELF WHEN AFTER I'D SPENT A DAY AND A SLEEPLESS NIGHT OVER THE JOB
3665-8587-0007 I SAW THE GAME OF TIT TAT TOE THAT ROOUM MADE OF IT IN AN HOUR OR TWO CERTIFICATED OR NOT
3665-8587-0008 AND HE WAS ONE OF THESE FELLOWS TOO WHO CAN FIND WATER TELL YOU WHERE WATER IS AND WHAT AMOUNT OF GETTING IT IS LIKELY TO TAKE BY JUST WALKING OVER THE PLACE WE AREN'T CERTIFICATED UP TO THAT YET
3665-8587-0009 BUT HE ALWAYS SHOOK HIS BLACK AND WHITE PIEBALD HEAD HE'D NEVER BE ABLE TO KEEP THE BARGAIN IF HE WERE TO MAKE IT HE TOLD US QUITE FAIRLY
3665-8587-0010 SO ROOUM CAME AND WENT ERRATICALLY SHOWING UP MAYBE IN LEEDS OR LIVERPOOL
3665-8587-0011 GOT TO KNOW HIM I MEAN MORE THAN JUST TO NOD WAS THAT HE TACKED HIMSELF ON TO ME ONE NIGHT DOWN VAUXHALL WAY
3665-8587-0012 WE HAD KNOCKED OFF FOR THE DAY AND I WAS WALKING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BRIDGE WHEN HE CAME UP WE WALKED ALONG TOGETHER AND
3665-8587-0013 KNOW WHAT A MOLECULE WAS
3665-8587-0014 SO ON THE WAY ACROSS THE BRIDGE I GAVE IT HIM MORE OR LESS FROM THE BOOK MOLECULAR THEORY AND ALL THE REST OF IT
3665-8587-0015 DID THE MOLECULAR THEORY ALLOW THINGS TO PASS THROUGH ONE ANOTHER HE WANTED TO KNOW COULD THINGS PASS THROUGH ONE ANOTHER AND A LOT OF RIDICULOUS THINGS LIKE THAT I GAVE IT UP YOU'RE A GENIUS IN YOUR OWN WAY ROOUM I SAID FINALLY
3665-8587-0016 YOU KNOW THESE THINGS WITHOUT THE BOOKS WE PLODDERS HAVE TO DEPEND ON IF I'D LUCK LIKE THAT
3665-8587-0017 BUT I HAD HIS ACQUAINTANCE WHICH WAS MORE THAN MOST OF US HAD HE ASKED ME RATHER TIMIDLY IF I'D LEND HIM A BOOK OR TWO I DID SO BUT
3665-8587-0018 NOW YOU'D EXPECT A FELLOW TO BE SPECIALLY SENSITIVE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WHO CAN TELL WHEN THERE'S WATER A HUNDRED FEET BENEATH HIM AND AS YOU KNOW THE BIG MEN ARE SQUABBLING YET ABOUT THIS WATER FINDING BUSINESS
3665-8587-0019 BUT SOMEHOW THE WATER FINDING PUZZLED ME LESS THAN IT DID THAT ROOUM SHOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY SENSITIVE TO SOMETHING FAR COMMONER AND EASIER TO UNDERSTAND ORDINARY ECHOES HE COULDN'T STAND ECHOES
3665-8587-0020 AND SOMETIMES HE'D LOITER AND LISTEN VERY INTENTLY
3665-8587-0021 THEN OF COURSE I PRETENDED NOT TO NOTICE WE'RE ALL CRANKY SOMEWHERE AND FOR THAT MATTER I CAN'T TOUCH A SPIDER MYSELF FOR THE REMARKABLE THING THAT OVERTOOK ROOUM THAT BY THE WAY IS AN ODD WAY TO PUT IT
3665-8587-0022 FOR THE REMARKABLE THING THAT OVERTOOK ROOUM I DON'T THINK I CAN BEGIN BETTER THAN WITH THE FIRST TIME OR VERY SOON AFTER THE FIRST TIME THAT I NOTICED THIS PECULIARITY ABOUT THE ECHOES
3665-8587-0023 IT WAS EARLY ON A PARTICULARLY DISMAL NOVEMBER EVENING
3665-8587-0024 JUST BEYOND WHAT THEY ARE PLEASED TO CALL THE BUILDING LINE YOU KNOW THESE DISTRICTS OF WRETCHED TREES AND GRIMY FIELDS AND MARKET GARDENS THAT ARE ABOUT THE SAME TO REAL COUNTRY THAT A SLUM IS TO A TOWN IT RAINED THAT NIGHT
3665-8587-0025 BUT YOU'VE DOUBTLESS SEEN THEM YOU KNOW HOW WHEN THEY'RE LAYING OUT NEW ROADS THEY LAY DOWN THE NARROW STRIP OF KERB FIRST WITH NEITHER SETTS ON THE ONE HAND NOR FLAGSTONES ON THE OTHER
3665-8587-0026 ROOUM HAD ALL AT ONCE STOPPED TALKING IT WAS THE ECHO OF COURSE THAT BOTHERED HIM
3665-8587-0027 AND RAMPARTS OF GREY ROAD METAL READY FOR USE AND SAVE FOR THE STRIP OF KERB IT WAS A BROTH OF MUD AND STIFF CLAY A RED LIGHT OR TWO SHOWED WHERE THE ROAD BARRIERS WERE THEY WERE LAYING THE MAINS A GREEN RAILWAY LIGHT SHOWED ON AN EMBANKMENT
3665-8587-0028 LAMP STANDARDS WERE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE AND WHEN I HEARD ROOUM STOP SUDDENLY AND DRAW IN HIS BREATH SHARPLY I THOUGHT HE HAD WALKED INTO ONE OF THEM HURT YOURSELF I SAID HE WALKED ON WITHOUT REPLYING
3665-8587-0029 BUT HALF A DOZEN YARDS FARTHER ON HE STOPPED AGAIN HE WAS LISTENING AGAIN HE WAITED FOR ME TO COME UP I SAY HE SAID IN AN ODD SORT OF VOICE
3665-8587-0030 I ASKED AS I PASSED AHEAD HE DIDN'T ANSWER
3665-8587-0031 HE WAS BREATHING VERY QUICK AND SHORT WHY WHAT AILS YOU I DEMANDED STOPPING
3665-8587-0032 I SAW HIM PASS HIS HAND OVER HIS BROW COME GET ON I SAID SHORTLY AND WE DIDN'T SPEAK AGAIN TILL WE STRUCK THE PAVEMENT WITH THE LIGHTED LAMPS THEN I HAPPENED TO GLANCE AT HIM HERE I SAID BRUSQUELY TAKING HIM BY THE SLEEVE
3665-8587-0033 YOU'RE NOT WELL WE'LL CALL SOMEWHERE AND GET A DRINK YES
3665-8587-0034 DID YOU HEAR HEAR WHAT
3665-8587-0035 COME YOU'RE SHAKING
3665-8587-0036 I SAW THAT HE WAS SHAKING EVEN WORSE THAN I HAD THOUGHT THE SHIRT SLEEVED BARMAN NOTICED IT TOO AND WATCHED US CURIOUSLY I MADE ROOUM SIT DOWN
3665-8587-0037 I ASKED AS I HELD THE GLASS TO HIS LIPS BUT I COULD GET NOTHING OUT OF HIM EXCEPT THAT IT WAS ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT
3665-8587-0038 HE BEGAN TO COME ROUND A LITTLE HE WASN'T THE KIND OF MAN YOU'D PRESS FOR EXPLANATIONS AND PRESENTLY WE SET OUT AGAIN HE WALKED WITH ME AS FAR AS MY LODGINGS REFUSED TO COME IN BUT FOR ALL THAT LINGERED AT THE GATE AS IF LOATH TO LEAVE
3665-8587-0039 I WATCHED HIM TURN THE CORNER IN THE RAIN WE CAME HOME TOGETHER AGAIN THE NEXT EVENING BUT BY A DIFFERENT WAY QUITE HALF A MILE LONGER
3665-8587-0040 OR SOME SUCH THING FOR YOU CAN'T PUT HIM OFF AS YOU CAN THE CHILD SOMEWHERE OR OTHER HE'D PICKED UP THE WORD OSMOSIS
3665-8587-0041 HE DROPPED THE MOLECULES AND BEGAN TO ASK ME ABOUT OSMOSIS
3665-8587-0042 HE DEMANDED THAT LIQUIDS WILL WORK THEIR WAY INTO ONE ANOTHER THROUGH A BLADDER OR SOMETHING SAY A THICK FLUID AND A THIN YOU'LL FIND SOME OF THE THICK IN THE THIN AND THE THIN IN THE THICK YES THE THICK INTO THE THIN IS EX OSMOSIS
3665-8587-0043 AND THE OTHER END OSMOSIS
3665-8587-0044 DOES IT EVER TAKE PLACE WITH SOLIDS
3665-8587-0045 HE DISAPPEARED FOR A GOOD MANY WEEKS
3665-8587-0046 IT WAS FEBRUARY WEATHER ANYWAY AND IN AN ECHOING ENOUGH PLACE THAT I FOUND HIM THE SUBWAY OF ONE OF THE METROPOLITAN STATIONS HE'D PROBABLY FORGOTTEN THE ECHOES WHEN HE'D TAKEN THE TRAIN BUT OF COURSE THE
3665-8587-0047 RAILWAY FOLK WON'T LET A MAN WHO HAPPENS TO DISLIKE ECHOES GO WANDERING ACROSS THE METALS WHERE HE LIKES
3665-8587-0048 I RAN ALONG THE SUBWAY AFTER HIM IT WAS VERY CURIOUS HE'D BEEN WALKING CLOSE TO THE WHITE TILED WALL AND I SAW HIM SUDDENLY STOP BUT HE DIDN'T TURN HE DIDN'T EVEN TURN WHEN I PULLED UP CLOSE BEHIND HIM
3665-8587-0049 BUT THE MOMENT I TOUCHED HIS SHOULDER HE JUST DROPPED JUST DROPPED HALF ON HIS KNEES AGAINST THE WHITE TILING THE FACE HE TURNED ROUND AND UP TO ME WAS TRANSFIXED WITH FRIGHT THERE WERE HALF A HUNDRED PEOPLE ABOUT A TRAIN WAS JUST IN
3665-8587-0050 AND IT ISN'T A DIFFICULT MATTER IN LONDON TO GET A CROWD FOR MUCH LESS THAN A MAN CROUCHING TERRIFIED AGAINST A WALL
3665-8587-0051 AT ANOTHER MAN ALMOST AS TERRIFIED I FELT SOMEBODY'S HAND ON MY OWN ARM EVIDENTLY SOMEBODY THOUGHT I'D KNOCKED ROOUM DOWN THE TERROR WENT SLOWLY FROM HIS FACE HE STUMBLED TO HIS FEET
3665-8587-0052 I SHOOK MYSELF FREE OF THE MAN WHO HELD ME AND STEPPED UP TO ROOUM WHAT THE DEVIL'S ALL THIS ABOUT I DEMANDED ROUGHLY ENOUGH IT'S ALL RIGHT IT'S ALL RIGHT HE STAMMERED
3665-8587-0053 NO NO BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T DO IT AGAIN WE'LL NOT EXPLAIN HERE I SAID
3665-8587-0054 AND THE SMALL CROWD MELTED AWAY DISAPPOINTED I DARE SAY THAT IT WASN'T A FIGHT
3665-8587-0055 BUT THERE YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW DO YOU I TELL YOU D'YOU HEAR YOU'RE NOT TO RUN AT ALL WHEN I'M ABOUT
3665-8587-0056 AND GET YOUR QUANTITIES SOMEWHERE NEAR RIGHT
3665-8587-0057 PUTTING YOUR HAND ON A MAN'S SHOULDER LIKE THAT JUST WHEN
3665-8587-0058 AH HE CRIED DON'T YOU THINK I JUST FANCY IT MY LAD NOTHING SO EASY I THOUGHT YOU GUESSED THAT OTHER TIME ON THE NEW ROAD IT'S AS PLAIN AS A PIKESTAFF NO NO NO
3665-8587-0059 I SHALL BE TELLING YOU SOMETHING ABOUT MOLECULES ONE OF THESE DAYS WE WALKED FOR A TIME IN SILENCE SUDDENLY HE ASKED
3665-8587-0060 I MYSELF DO YOU MEAN OH THE FIRM
3665-8587-0061 THEY CALL IT ALTERATIONS BUT IT'S ONE OF THESE BIG SHOP REBUILDINGS I'LL COME ALONG
3665-8587-0062 OH I SAID I DON'T KNOW THAT I SPECIALLY WANTED HIM IT'S A LITTLE WEARING THE COMPANY OF A CHAP LIKE THAT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO LET YOU IN FOR NEXT BUT
3665-8587-0063 I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
3665-8587-0064 WHICH WAS MY OWN PROGRAMME HE WAS WELCOME
3665-8587-0065 HE TURNED UP AT EUSTON A LITTLE AFTER TWELVE WE WENT DOWN TOGETHER
3665-8587-0066 OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND OUR TALK TOO WAS ABOUT WORK NOT MOLECULES AND OSMOSIS THE INN WAS ONLY A ROADSIDE BEERHOUSE
3665-8587-0067 AND ALL ITS SLEEPING ACCOMODATION WAS THE ONE DOUBLE BEDDED ROOM OVER THE HEAD OF MY OWN BED THE CEILING WAS CUT AWAY FOLLOWING THE ROOF LINE AND THE WALLPAPER WAS PERFECTLY SHOCKING FADED BOUQUETS THAT MADE V'S AND A'S
3665-8587-0068 INTERLACING EVERYWHERE THE OTHER BED WAS MADE UP
3665-8587-0069 AND THAT WAS WHEN ROOUM TOOK FROM HIS BLACK HAND BAG A BRUSH AND A TORN NIGHTGOWN THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS CARRY ABOUT IS IT I REMARKED AND ROOUM GRUNTED SOMETHING YES
3665-8587-0070 NO HARM WAS IT WE TUMBLED INTO BED BUT FOR ALL THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR I WASN'T SLEEPY SO FROM MY OWN BAG I TOOK A BOOK SET THE CANDLE ON THE END OF THE MANTEL AND BEGAN TO READ
3665-8587-0071 MARK YOU I DON'T SAY I WAS MUCH BETTER INFORMED FOR THE READING I DID FOR I WAS WATCHING THE V'S ON THE WALLPAPER MOSTLY THAT AND WONDERING WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE MAN IN THE OTHER BED WHO HAD FALLEN DOWN AT A TOUCH IN THE SUBWAY
3665-8587-0072 I'M QUITE CERTAIN HE WAS SOUND ASLEEP SO THAT IT WASN'T JUST THE FACT THAT HE SPOKE EVEN THAT IS A LITTLE UNPLEASANT I ALWAYS THINK ANY SORT OF SLEEP TALKING
3665-8587-0073 KNOWING NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT IT IN THE MORNING PERHAPS I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE PUT THAT QUESTION HAVING PUT IT I DID THE NEXT BEST THING AFTERWARDS AS YOU'LL SEE IN A MOMENT BUT LET ME TELL YOU
3665-8587-0074 HE'D BEEN ASLEEP PERHAPS AN HOUR AND I WOOLGATHERING ABOUT THE WALLPAPER WHEN SUDDENLY IN A FAR MORE CLEAR AND LOUD VOICE THAN HE EVER USED WHEN AWAKE HE SAID WHAT THE DEVIL IS IT PREVENTS ME SEEING HIM THEN
3665-8587-0075 THAT STARTLED ME RATHER
3665-8587-0076 FROM SEEING WHOM I SAID SITTING UP IN BED WHOM YOU'RE NOT ATTENDING THE FELLOW I'M TELLING YOU ABOUT WHO RUNS AFTER ME HE ANSWERED ANSWERED PERFECTLY PLAINLY
3665-8587-0077 HE MADE A SLIGHT MOVEMENT WITH HIS ARM BUT THAT DID NOT WAKE HIM THEN IT CAME TO ME WITH A SORT OF START WHAT WAS HAPPENING I SLIPPED HALF OUT OF BED WOULD HE WOULD HE ANSWER ANOTHER QUESTION I RISKED IT BREATHLESSLY
3665-8587-0078 HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHO HE IS WELL THAT TOO HE ANSWERED WHO HE IS THE RUNNER DON'T BE SILLY
3665-8587-0079 WHAT HAPPENS THEN WHEN HE CATCHES YOU THIS TIME I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHETHER HIS WORDS WERE AN ANSWER OR NOT THEY WERE THESE TO HEAR HIM CATCHING YOU UP AND THEN PADDING AWAY AHEAD AGAIN ALL RIGHT
3665-8587-0080 WHAT DID YOU SAY HIS NAME WAS
3665-8587-0081 ROOUM I REMEMBER REMARKED ON THE SILLY PRACTICE OF READING IN BED WELL IT WAS A PRETTY
3665-8587-0082 SOMEBODY RUNNING AFTER HIM ALL THE TIME AND THEN RUNNING ON AHEAD
3665-8587-0083 SUCH AS THAT OF THE NEW ROAD OUT LEWISHAM WAY
3665-8587-0084 WHETHER THE NAME OF THAT RUNNER WAS NOT CONSCIENCE BUT CONSCIENCE ISN'T A MATTER OF MOLECULES AND OSMOSIS ONE THING HOWEVER WAS CLEAR I'D GOT TO TELL ROOUM WHAT I'D LEARNED
3665-8587-0085 FOR YOU CAN'T GET HOLD OF A FELLOW'S SECRETS IN WAYS LIKE THAT I LOST NO TIME ABOUT IT I TOLD HIM IN FACT SOON AFTER WE'D LEFT THE INN THE NEXT MORNING TOLD HIM HOW HE'D ANSWERED IN HIS SLEEP AND
3665-8587-0086 HE GRUNTED BUT GOOD GOD MAN QUEER ISN'T IT
3665-8587-0087 HE WHISPERED IT GETS HARDER EVERY TIME
3665-8587-0088 LIKE WHEN YOU NOD OFF TO SLEEP IN A CHAIR AND JERK UP AWAKE AGAIN AND AWAY HE WENT BUT NOW IT'S GETTING GRINDING SLUGGISH AND THE PAIN
3665-8587-0089 WHEN I'D JUST BRACED MYSELF UP STIFF TO MEET IT AND YOU TAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER
3665-8587-0090 HE CONTINUED IT'S AN AGONY EACH TIME
3665-8587-0091 BUT I'D HAD ENOUGH I'D ASKED QUESTIONS THE NIGHT BEFORE BUT NOW WELL I KNEW QUITE AS MUCH AS AND MORE THAN I WANTED STOP PLEASE I SAID YOU'RE EITHER OFF YOUR HEAD OR WORSE LET'S
3665-8587-0092 DON'T TELL ME ANY MORE PLEASE FRIGHTENED WHAT
3665-8587-0093 I SHOULD SEE A DOCTOR I'M ONLY AN ENGINEER I REPLIED DOCTORS
3665-8587-0094 HE SAID AND SPAT I HOPE YOU SEE HOW THE MATTER STOOD WITH ROOUM WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT COULD YOU HAVE BELIEVED IT DO YOU BELIEVE IT HE'D MADE A NEARISH GUESS
3665-8587-0095 ONLY RULE OF THUMB PHYSICS THINKS EVERYTHING'S EXPLAINED IN THE MANUAL
3665-8587-0096 YOU CAN CALL IT FORCE OR WHAT YOU LIKE BUT IT'S A CERTAINTY THAT THINGS SOLID THINGS OF WOOD AND IRON AND STONE WOULD EXPLODE
3665-8587-0097 THAT ROOUM SAID HE FELT IN HIS OWN PERSON
3665-8587-0098 OR HAD TO STRUGGLE THROUGH OBSTINATELY YOU SEE NOW WHY I SAID THAT A QUEER THING OVERTOOK ROOUM MORE I SAW IT
3665-8587-0099 THERE WASN'T A SHADOW OF DOUBT ABOUT IT PEOPLE WERE PRESSING AND JOSTLING ABOUT HIM AND SUDDENLY I SAW HIM TURN HIS HEAD AND LISTEN AS I'D SEEN HIM BEFORE I TELL YOU AN ICY CREEPING RAN ALL OVER MY SKIN I FANCIED I FELT IT APPROACHING TOO NEARER AND NEARER
3665-8587-0100 AS IF AGAINST A GUST HE STUMBLED AND THRUST THRUST WITH HIS BODY HE SWAYED PHYSICALLY AS A TREE SWAYS IN A WIND
3665-8587-0101 THEN AFTER SECONDS MINUTES I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG HE WAS FREE AGAIN AND FOR THE COLOUR OF HIS FACE WHEN BY AND BY I GLANCED AT IT WELL I ONCE SAW A SWARTHY ITALIAN FALL UNDER A SUNSTROKE AND HIS FACE WAS MUCH THE SAME COLOUR THAT ROOUM'S NEGRO FACE HAD GONE
3665-8587-0102 A CLOUDY WHITISH GREEN WELL YOU'VE SEEN IT
3665-8587-0103 HE GASPED PRESENTLY TURNING A GHASTLY GRIN ON ME
3665-8587-0104 SOON AFTER THAT HE DISAPPEARED AGAIN I WASN'T SORRY OUR BIG CONTRACT IN THE WEST END CAME ON IT WAS A TIME CONTRACT WITH ALL MANNER OF PENALTY CLAUSES IF WE DIDN'T GET THROUGH AND I ASSURE YOU THAT WE WERE BUSY
3665-8587-0105 AND IF YOU'D SEEN US THERE BUT PERHAPS YOU DID SEE US
3665-8587-0106 TO LOOK OVER THE MUD SPLASHED HOARDING INTO THE GREAT EXCAVATION WE'D MADE IT WAS A SIGHT STAGING ROSE ON STAGING TIER ON TIER WITH INTERMINABLE LADDERS ALL OVER THE STEEL STRUCTURE THREE OR FOUR SQUAT OTIS LIFTS CROUCHED LIKE IRON TURTLES ON TOP
3665-8587-0107 AND A LATTICE CRANE ON A TOWERING THREE CORNERED PLATFORM ROSE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FEET INTO THE AIR
3665-8587-0108 SHOWING FLUES AND FIREPLACES AND A SCORE OF THICKNESSES OF OLD WALLPAPER AND AT NIGHT
3665-8587-0109 A DOZEN GREAT SPLUTTERING VIOLET ARC LIGHTS HALF BLINDED YOU DOWN BELOW WERE THE WATCHMEN'S FIRES OVERHEAD THE RIVETERS HAD THEIR FIRE BASKETS AND IN ODD CORNERS NAPHTHA LIGHTS GUTTERED AND FLARED
3665-8587-0110 AND THE STEEL RANG WITH THE RIVETERS HAMMERS AND THE CRANE CHAINS RATTLED AND CLASHED THERE'S NOT MUCH DOUBT IN MY MIND IT'S THE ENGINEERS WHO ARE THE ARCHITECTS NOWADAYS THE CHAPS WHO THINK THEY'RE THE ARCHITECTS ARE ONLY A SORT OF PAPERHANGERS
3665-8587-0111 WHO HANG BRICK AND TERRA COTTA ON OUR WORK AND CLAP A PINNACLE OR TWO ON TOP BUT NEVER MIND THAT
3665-8587-0112 AND I OUGHT TO SAY THAT FIFTY FEET ABOVE OUR GREAT GAP
3665-8587-0113 IT HAPPENED THAT THEY HAD PITCHED IN AS ONE OF THE FOREMEN SOME FELLOW OR OTHER
3665-8587-0114 I DID HALF HIS WORK AND ALL MY OWN
3665-8587-0115 ON THIS NIGHT THAT I'M TELLING ABOUT
3665-8587-0116 AT THAT I FAIRLY LOST MY TEMPER WHAT AILS THE CRANE I CRIED IT'S DOING ITS WORK ISN'T IT ISN'T EVERYBODY DOING THEIR WORK EXCEPT YOU
3665-8587-0117 I DON'T KNOW HE SAID THEN I SNAPPED
3665-8587-0118 BUT HE GRABBED MY ARM LOOK AT IT NOW
3665-8587-0119 EITHER HOPKINS OR SOMEBODY WAS DANGEROUSLY EXCEEDING THE SPEED LIMIT THE THING WAS FLYING ALONG ITS THIRTY YARDS OF RAIL AS FAST AS A TRAM AND THE HEAVY FALL BLOCKS SWUNG LIKE A PONDEROUS KITE TAIL THIRTY FEET BELOW AS I WATCHED THE ENGINE BROUGHT UP WITHIN A YARD OF THE END OF THE WAY
3665-8587-0120 AND THEN THE MECHANISM WAS REVERSED THE CRANE SET OFF AT A TEAR BACK WHO IN HELL I BEGAN
3665-8587-0121 AGAIN THE CRANE TORE PAST WITH THE MASSIVE TACKLE SWEEPING BEHIND IT AND AGAIN I HEARD THE CRASH AT THE OTHER END
3665-8587-0122 HIS BROW WAS RIBBED LIKE A GRIDIRON
3665-8587-0123 NOW YOU
3665-8587-0124 GET READY TO BOARD HIM WHEN HE REVERSES
3665-8587-0125 JUST HOW WE SCRAMBLED ON I DON'T KNOW I GOT ONE ARM OVER THE LIFTING GEAR WHICH OF COURSE WASN'T GOING AND HEARD HOPKINS ON THE OTHER FOOTPLATE ROOUM PUT THE BRAKES DOWN AND REVERSED AGAIN CAME THE THUD OF THE FALL BLOCKS AND WE WERE SPEEDING BACK AGAIN OVER THE GULF OF MISTY ORANGE LIGHT
3665-8587-0126 THE STAGINGS WERE THRONGED WITH GAPING MEN READY
3665-8587-0127 HOPKINS HIT ROOUM'S WRIST WITH A SPANNER THEN HE SEIZED THE LEVER JAMMED THE BRAKE DOWN AND TRIPPED ROOUM ALL AS IT SEEMED IN ONE MOVEMENT I FELL ON TOP OF ROOUM THE CRANE CAME TO A STANDSTILL HALF WAY DOWN THE LINE I HELD ROOUM PANTING
3665-8587-0128 BUT EITHER ROOUM WAS STRONGER THAN I OR ELSE HE TOOK ME VERY MUCH UNAWARES
3665-8587-0129 HE THREW UP ONE ELBOW AND STAGGERED TO HIS FEET AS I MADE ANOTHER CLUTCH AT HIM KEEP STILL YOU FOOL I BAWLED
3665-8587-0130 RUNNING ALONG THAT IRON TIGHTROPE OUT OVER THAT WELL OF LIGHT AND WATCHING MEN
3665-8587-0131 HORRIBLY FASCINATED AND THEN I SAW THE TURN OF HIS HEAD HE DIDN'T MEET IT THIS TIME
3665-8587-0132 EVEN AT THE TAKE OFF HE MISSED
3665-8587-0133 THEN FROM FAR BELOW
3665-8587-0134 THE MEN ABOVE WENT A LITTLE WAY DOWN AND THEN THEY TOO STOPPED
3665-8587-0135 TWO MEN DRANK THE BRANDY OFF THERE AND THEN GETTING ON FOR A PINT OF BRANDY APIECE THEN THEY WENT DOWN DRUNK
3665-8587-0136 WHEN I ASKED HIM WHAT I SAID HE HESITATED
