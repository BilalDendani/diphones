1031-133220-0000 MOURNING CUSTOMS THERE HAS BEEN OF LATE YEARS A HEALTHY REVOLT AGAINST THE EXCESSIVE USE OF CREPE OR THE WEARING OF MOURNING FOR AN UNDUE PERIOD MOURNING IS FIRST OF ALL A PROTECTION
1031-133220-0001 FOR IN THESE BUSY DAYS AND IN A LARGE CITY A DEATH AFFECTING OUR ACQUAINTANCES IS NOT ALWAYS KNOWN TO US IF WE MEET A FRIEND WEARING BLACK WE ARE INSTANTLY APPRISED THAT SHE HAS SUFFERED THE LOSS OF A NEAR MEMBER OF HER FAMILY
1031-133220-0002 IT IS EASY TO SAY UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES I AM VERY SORRY TO SEE YOU IN BLACK OR I AM AFRAID I HAVE NOT HEARD OF YOUR LOSS FOR A FATHER OR MOTHER FULL MOURNING THAT IS BLACK
1031-133220-0003 UNRELIEVED BY ANY TOUCH OF WHITE IS WORN FOR A YEAR AND AT THE END OF THAT PERIOD HALF MOURNING CONSISTING FIRST OF WHITE WITH BLACK AND THEN VIOLET AND GRAY IS WORN FOR THE SECOND YEAR

1031-133220-0005 PUT ON AT THE DEATH OF A RELATIVE BY MARRIAGE CONSISTS OF THE WEARING OF BLACK FOR A PERIOD OF FROM SIX WEEKS
1031-133220-0006 DEPENDING ON THE CLOSENESS OF THE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP FOR INSTANCE IN THE CASE OF THE DEATH OF A MOTHER IN LAW RESIDING IN A DISTANT CITY IT WOULD ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR A WOMAN TO WEAR BLACK FOR A FEW WEEKS FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL
1031-133220-0007 IF ON THE OTHER HAND SHE RESIDES IN THE SAME PLACE AND IS A GREAT DEAL IN THE COMPANY OF HER HUSBAND'S FAMILY IT WOULD SHOW MORE TACT AND AFFECTION ON HER PART TO REFRAIN FROM WEARING COLORS FOR A LONGER PERIOD
1031-133220-0008 CREPE IS NO LONGER OBLIGATORY IN EVEN FIRST MOURNING MANY WIDOWS ONLY WEAR THE CREPE BORDERED VEIL HANGING FROM THE CONVENTIONAL BONNET FOR THE FUNERAL SERVICES AND FOR A FEW WEEKS AFTERWARD

1031-133220-0011 OF COURSE THE CONVENTIONAL PERIOD OF MOURNING FOR A WIDOW IS THREE YEARS BUT IF THERE SHOULD BE ANY INDICATION THAT A SECOND MARRIAGE IS CONTEMPLATED BLACK SHOULD GRADUALLY BE PUT ASIDE HOWEVER
1031-133220-0012 THE DISCARDING OF MOURNING IS NO INDICATION THAT A WOMAN IS ABOUT TO CHANGE HER NAME AND THE WEARING OF BLACK IS SO MUCH A MATTER OF PERSONAL FEELING

1031-133220-0036 IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SEND ONE'S VISITING CARD TO THE HOSTESS BY THE SERVANT WHO OPENS THE DOOR PRONOUNCING THE NAME DISTINCTLY IS SUFFICIENT BUT IF IT IS A FIRST CALL AND THERE IS DANGER THAT THE HOSTESS MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH THE CALLER'S ADDRESS

1031-133220-0038 AN INVITATION TO A WEDDING RECEPTION OR BREAKFAST DEMANDS A MORE FORMAL ACCEPTANCE SENT IMMEDIATELY ON RECEIPT OF THE INVITATION AND COUCHED IN THE SAME MANNER IN WHICH THE INVITATION READS A NEWCOMER IN TOWN
1031-133220-0039 OR A YOUNG MARRIED WOMAN MAY RECEIVE A CARD FROM AN OLDER WOMAN INDICATING HER RECEIVING DAYS AND HOURS THIS IS A POLITE INVITATION TO CALL AND IF SHE IS UNABLE TO MAKE A CALL AT THE TIME INDICATED SHE SHOULD SEND A CARD ON THAT DAY
1031-133220-0040 CARDS OF CONDOLENCE ARE LEFT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER LEARNING OF THE AFFLICTION IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO WRITE ANYTHING ON THE CARD IN FACT IT IS BETTER NOT TO DO SO FOR
1031-133220-0041 IF THE ACQUAINTANCE WARRANTS A PERSONAL MESSAGE IT SHOULD TAKE THE FORM OF A LETTER ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS QUITE PROPER IN FELICITATING A FRIEND ON A HAPPY EVENT SUCH AS THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN ENGAGEMENT IN THE FAMILY OR THE ARRIVAL OF A NEW BABY
1031-133220-0042 TO SEND A VISITING CARD WITH CONGRATULATIONS WRITTEN ON IT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT SEEMS NECESSARY TO SEND CARDS TO PRACTICALLY ALL ONE'S ACQUAINTANCES THIS IS WISE AFTER A LONG ABSENCE
1031-133220-0043 OR A CHANGE OF RESIDENCE AND WHEN ONE IS LEAVING TOWN FOR A LONG PERIOD IT IS PROPER TO SEND CARDS WITH THE FRENCH EXPRESSION POUR PRENDRE
1031-133220-0044 FORMALITIES IN DRESS AND ETIQUETTE COSTLY THY HABIT AS THY PURSE CAN BUY WAS OLD POLONIUS ADVICE TO HIS SON AND HE COUNSELED SUITABILITY AS WELL
1031-133220-0045 IT IS THIS QUESTION OF SUITABILITY THAT IS THE HALL MARK OF CORRECT DRESSING A SAFE RULE TO FOLLOW ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF A YOUNG WOMAN IS NOT TO BE CONSPICUOUS IN ATTIRE
1031-133220-0046 AND TO CONFORM TO THE STANDARDS OF DRESS AS SET DOWN BY OLDER WOMEN OF RECOGNIZED STANDING IN THE TOWN IN WHICH SHE LIVES AND THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH HER SOCIAL OR BUSINESS LIFE IS SPENT A YOUNG GIRL NEEDS LITTLE ADORNING
1031-133220-0047 HER SCHOOL OR COLLEGE DRESSES SHOULD BE CHARACTERIZED BY THEIR NEATNESS FRESHNESS CORRECTNESS OF CUT AND UTILITY RATHER THAN BY ELABORATE TRIMMINGS OR COSTLY MATERIALS HER PARTY GOWNS ARE SIMPLER THAN THOSE OF A GIRL WHO HAS LEFT SCHOOL
1031-133220-0048 SHE BEGINS HER SOCIAL CAREER UNDER THE PLEASANTEST AUSPICES AND THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HER FIRST ELABORATE GOWN
1031-133220-0049 IT MOST COMMONLY TAKES THE FORM OF AN AFTERNOON TEA OR RECEPTION TO WHICH HER MOTHER INVITES ALL OF HER FRIENDS AS WELL AS THE YOUNGER SET THE DEBUTANTE RECEIVES WITH HER MOTHER AND WEARS AN ELABORATE FROCK OF LIGHT MATERIAL AND COLOR
1031-133220-0050 MADE HIGH IN THE NECK AND WITH ELBOW SLEEVES LONG WHITE GLOVES ARE WORN AND HER HAIR IS MORE ELABORATELY ARRANGED THAN IT WAS DURING HER SCHOOL GIRL PERIOD IN FACT SHE IS NOW A FULL FLEDGED YOUNG LADY AND IS DRESSED ACCORDINGLY
1031-133220-0051 SUCH A GOWN MAY SERVE LATER AS AN INFORMAL EVENING GOWN OR IF IT IS MADE WITH A DETACHABLE YOKE IT MAY BE WORN AS A DANCING FROCK OR FOR ANY EVENING OCCASION FOR WHICH A FULL EVENING GOWN IS EXPECTED
1031-133220-0052 THE RECEIVING PARTY AT AN AFTERNOON FUNCTION GENERALLY INCLUDES NEAR RELATIVES OF THE DEBUTANTE AND A NUMBER OF HER INTIMATE GIRL FRIENDS ARE ASKED TO ASSIST IN VARIOUS WAYS
1031-133220-0053 THESE RECEIVE WITH HER AND HER MOTHER IN THE EARLY PART OF THE AFTERNOON AND LATER ASSIST AT THE TEA TABLE OR MINGLE AMONG THE GUESTS THE LADIES ASSISTING DO NOT WEAR HATS AND THE YOUNG GIRLS IN THE PARTY ARE GOWNED MUCH LIKE THE DEBUTANTE
1031-133220-0054 EXCEPT THAT THEIR GOWNS MAY BE LESS ELABORATE IF THEY CHOOSE AND THEY DO NOT CARRY FLOWERS A POPULAR GIRL OR ONE WITH MANY FAMILY CONNECTIONS MAY COUNT ON A GOOD MANY FLORAL OFFERINGS ON THE OCCASION OF HER COMING OUT PARTY
1031-133220-0055 THESE ARE SCATTERED ABOUT THE ROOM EITHER LEFT IN BUNCHES OR ARRANGED IN VASES ONE LARGE BUNCH SHE GENERALLY CARRIES IN HER LEFT HAND AND IT IS A WISE GIRL WHO AVOIDS SINGLING OUT ANYONE OF HER MEN FRIENDS BY CARRYING HIS FLOWERS
1031-133220-0056 A GIFT FROM HER FATHER OR BROTHER OR THE FLOWERS SENT BY SOME FRIEND OF THE FAMILY IS THE BETTER CHOICE THE SUCCESS A GIRL MAKES DURING HER FIRST YEAR IN SOCIETY DEPENDS MORE ON HER GENERAL POPULARITY THAN ON THE DEVOTION OF ANY ONE MAN
1031-133220-0057 AFTERNOON RECEPTION FOR AN AFTERNOON RECEPTION LIGHT REFRESHMENTS CONSISTING OF TEA COFFEE CHOCOLATE PERHAPS A LIGHT CLARET CUP WITH CAKES AND DELICATE SANDWICHES ARE SUFFICIENT
1031-133220-0058 AND THESE ARE SET OUT ON A LONG TABLE IN A ROOM ADJOINING THE RECEPTION PARLORS IF A LARGE NUMBER OF GUESTS ARE EXPECTED IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAID OR TWO IN ATTENDANCE TO REMOVE CUPS AND SAUCERS KEEP THE TEA URN REPLENISHED WITH HOT WATER
1031-133220-0059 ONE AT EACH END TO POUR TEA AND CHOCOLATE AND AS THIS TASK IS AN ARDUOUS ONE AND MUCH OF THE SUCCESS OF THE ENTERTAINMENT DEPENDS ON ITS BEING WELL DONE IT IS ADVISABLE TO RELIEVE THE LADIES IN CHARGE DURING THE AFTERNOON THIS HOWEVER
1031-133220-0060 LIKE EVERY OTHER FEATURE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SHOULD BE ARRANGED BEFOREHAND THE CHARM OF AN AFTERNOON RECEPTION LIES IN ITS APPARENT INFORMALITY BUT EVERY DETAIL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADVANCE AND ALL CONTINGENCIES PROVIDED FOR
1031-133220-0061 THE DEBUTANTE AND ESPECIALLY HER MOTHER SHOULD BE RELIEVED FROM ALL SUCH RESPONSIBILITIES BEFORE THE GUESTS BEGIN TO COME THE MOTHER'S DUTIES CONSIST IN WELCOMING HER GUESTS AND PRESENTING HER DAUGHTER TO THEM
1031-133220-0062 IF MANY PEOPLE ARE ARRIVING THE GUESTS ARE QUICKLY PASSED ON TO SOME ONE OF THE LADIES ASSISTING WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO SEE THAT THEY MEET SOME OF THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY IN THE ROOM AND ARE EVENTUALLY ASKED TO THE TEA TABLE A PART OF THE RECEIVING PARTY
1031-133220-0063 AND CERTAINLY THE HOSTESS AND HER DAUGHTER SHOULD REMAIN TOGETHER IN A PLACE WHERE THEY MAY BE EASILY FOUND AS THE GUESTS ENTER THE ROOM NO MORE SYMPATHETIC ACT OF FRIENDSHIP CAN BE SHOWN A DEBUTANTE
1031-133220-0064 THAN TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE SUCCESS OF HER PARTY GIRLS WHO ARE ASKED TO ASSIST SHOULD REMEMBER THAT THEIR FIRST DUTY IS NOT TO ENTERTAIN THEIR OWN FRIENDS WHO MAY HAPPEN TO BE PRESENT
1031-133220-0065 BUT TO SEE THAT EVERYONE IS WELCOME AND THAT ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH MANY IN THE ROOM HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME SO ANYONE ASKED TO ASSIST AT A FUNCTION OF THIS SORT IS IN A SENSE A HOSTESS
1031-133220-0066 AND IT IS QUITE WITHIN HER PROVINCE TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION WITH ANY UNOCCUPIED GUEST WHETHER SHE HAS BEEN INTRODUCED OR NOT THE USUAL HOURS FOR AN AFTERNOON TEA ARE FROM FOUR TO SIX
1031-133220-0067 BUT IN THE CASE OF A COMING OUT RECEPTION THE HOUR IS OFTEN PROLONGED TO SEVEN SO AS TO ALLOW MORE MEN TO BE PRESENT THAN WOULD BE THE CASE IF THE TIME WERE RESTRICTED TO THE EARLY AFTERNOON
1031-133220-0068 AND IT IS ALWAYS A COMPLIMENT TO A GIRL IF HER TEA INCLUDES A SPRINKLING OF BLACK COATS WHATEVER HOURS ARE DECIDED ON THEY SHOULD BE ENGRAVED ON THE CARDS SENT OUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE TEA
1031-133220-0069 THESE ARE OF THE FORM AND SIZE OF AN ORDINARY VISITING CARD AND INCLUDE THE DAUGHTER'S NAME BELOW THAT OF HER MOTHER'S IF SHE IS THE ELDEST UNMARRIED DAUGHTER OR THE ONLY GIRL IN THE FAMILY THE CARD READS AS FOLLOWS
1031-133220-0070 MISS BLANK DECEMBER NINTH NINETEEN ELEVEN FOUR TO SEVEN O'CLOCK THE DAUGHTER'S GIVEN NAME IS ONLY USED IN CASE SHE HAS AN OLDER UNMARRIED SISTER
1031-133220-0071 BALL AND EVENING RECEPTION A MORE ELABORATE FORM OF COMING OUT PARTY CONSISTS OF A BALL OR OF AN EVENING RECEPTION FOLLOWED BY DANCING
1031-133220-0072 AND IN THIS CASE THE CARD CONTAINS THE WORD DANCING BELOW THE DATE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT AND THE HOURS AT WHICH IT IS GIVEN FEW HOMES ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE FOR EVEN A SMALL DANCE AND SO A PARTY OF THIS SORT IS GENERALLY GIVEN AT A HOTEL
1031-133220-0073 THE GUESTS AS WELL AS THE RECEIVING PARTY WEAR EVENING GOWNS WITHOUT HATS AND MEN ARE EXPECTED TO COME IN FULL EVENING CLOTHES WHICH MEANS THE LONG TAILED COATS AND NOT THE POPULAR TUXEDO WHITE GLOVES AND
1031-133220-0074 ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT OBLIGATORY WHITE WAISTCOATS AFTER A GIRL HAS BEEN INTRODUCED INTO SOCIETY SHE HAS HER INDIVIDUAL VISITING CARDS MAKES HER OWN CALLS
1031-133220-0075 SOCIAL CUSTOMS DIFFER WITH LOCALITY AND THE CHAPERON IS LESS CUSTOMARY IN THE WEST THAN IN THE EAST IN MANY CITIES GIRLS ARE ALLOWED TO GO TO THE THEATER AND TO EVENING PARTIES WITH A MAN FRIEND WITHOUT A MARRIED WOMAN BEING INCLUDED IN THE PARTY
1031-133220-0076 A WISE GIRL HOWEVER IS CAREFUL THAT ANY MAN SHE MEETS SHALL BE INTRODUCED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO SOME OLDER MEMBER OF HER FAMILY AND TO INTRODUCE A YOUNG MAN CALLING FOR THE FIRST TIME TO EITHER HER MOTHER OR FATHER
1031-133220-0077 ALSO WHEN SHE ACCEPTS AN INVITATION TO AN EVENING'S ENTERTAINMENT SHE INSISTS THAT HER ESCORT SHALL CALL FOR HER AT HER OWN HOME AND BRING HER DIRECTLY HOME AT THE CLOSE OF IT DINING OR SUPPING AT A RESTAURANT ALONE WITH A YOUNG MAN
1031-133220-0078 IS SURE TO EXPOSE A GIRL TO CRITICISM A WOMAN'S LUNCH THERE ARE MANY PLEASANT FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT OFFERED TO A YOUNG GIRL ENTERING SOCIETY IN WHICH MEN ARE NOT INCLUDED
1031-133220-0079 AND THE MOST POPULAR OF THESE IS A WOMAN'S LUNCH THIS IS A FAVORITE FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT FOR A YOUNG MARRIED WOMAN TO GIVE IN HONOR OF SOME GIRL FRIEND WHO HAS JUST COME OUT IN SOCIETY OR WHOSE ENGAGEMENT HAS JUST BEEN ANNOUNCED ONE O'CLOCK
1031-133220-0080 OR HALF AFTER IS THE USUAL HOUR AND THE MEAL IS SERVED IN COURSES AND IS AS ELABORATE AS THE HOUSEHOLD RESOURCES MAY ALLOW THE DECORATIONS OF THE TABLE ARE IMPORTANT AND THREE COURSES ARE SUFFICIENT IF THEY ARE CAREFULLY ARRANGED
1031-133220-0081 HANDSOME STREET COSTUMES ARE WORN FOR A FUNCTION OF THIS SORT AND THE GUEST OF HONOR IF THERE IS ONE DRESSES AS THE OTHERS DO OUTER WRAPS ARE LEFT IN THE HALL OR IN A ROOM PUT ASIDE FOR THIS PURPOSE AND AS A RULE
1031-133220-0082 HATS ARE RETAINED AND GLOVES REMOVED WHEN THE GUESTS SIT DOWN AT TABLE THE CUSTOM OF WEARING A HAT DURING LUNCH IS NOT AN ARBITRARY ONE AND IT IS NOT UNIVERSAL IN FRANCE FOR EXAMPLE
1031-133220-0083 WHERE SOCIAL CUSTOMS ARE MOST CAREFULLY OBSERVED IT IS THE CUSTOM TO WEAR HANDSOME AFTERNOON GOWNS IF INVITED FOR THE NOON MEAL AND TO REMOVE HATS THE NOON MEAL THERE IS A SOCIAL FUNCTION AND CERTAIN FORMALITIES ARE OBSERVED
1031-133220-0084 IN LONDON ON THE CONTRARY NO MATTER IF A NUMBER OF GUESTS ARE EXPECTED LUNCH IS AN INFORMAL OCCASION AND WOMEN DRESS FOR LUNCH AS THEY WOULD FOR AN AFTERNOON TEA HATS ARE WORN
1031-133220-0085 AND WOMEN ARE PREPARED TO RUSH OFF AFTERWARDS TO MEET OTHER ENGAGEMENTS THE ENGLISH CUSTOM PREVAILS NOW IN THE LARGE CITIES IN AMERICA AND MOREOVER
1031-133220-0086 WOMEN SEEM DISINCLINED TO REMOVE THEIR HATS AFTER THEY ARE ONCE DRESSED FOR THE ROUND OF THE DAY'S SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS IT IS SIMPLER AND REALLY QUITE CONVENTIONAL TO LEAVE THE WEARING OF HATS TO THE INDIVIDUAL
1031-133220-0087 AND SHE CAN AT THE SAME TIME INTIMATE TO HER GUEST IF SHE IS A STRANGER IN THE TOWN WHAT THE OTHERS WILL PROBABLY DO IN THIS CONNECTION TRUE HOSPITALITY ON THE PART OF THE HOSTESS IS TO MAKE HER GUESTS AT EASE
1031-133220-0088 AND TRUE POLITENESS ON THE PART OF THE VISITOR IS TO CONFORM TO THE RULES GOVERNING THE COMMUNITY THAT SHE IS VISITING PROPER APPAREL FOR MEN
1031-133220-0089 AMERICAN GENTLEMEN ARE NO LONGER DEPENDENT ON ENGLISH TAILORS OR ON ENGLISH FASHIONS AS THEY WERE SOME YEARS AGO THE AMERICAN TYPE OF PHYSIQUE IS A DISTINCT ONE
1031-133220-0090 AND LONDON TAILORS HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FIT AMERICAN MEN AS WELL AS THEY DO THEIR OWN CLIENTS MOREOVER SOCIAL LIFE IS SO DIFFERENT IN THE UNITED STATES FROM WHAT IT IS IN ENGLAND THAT MEN REALLY NEED DIFFERENT CLOTHES
1031-133220-0091 AND FEW OF THEM HAVE ANY TIME OR INCLINATION FOR ANYTHING SAVE BUSINESS CLOTHES WHILE DAYLIGHT LASTS FOR DINNER OR FOR THE EVENING WHAT ARE GENERALLY CALLED EVENING CLOTHES ARE PERMISSIBLE AND IN FACT OBLIGATORY
1031-133220-0092 IN LARGE CITIES FOR ANYTHING BEYOND THE MOST INFORMAL HOME FUNCTIONS FOR THE EVENING THERE IS THE INFORMAL AND FORMAL DRESS SUIT THE FORMER CONSISTS OF THE LONG TAILED COAT WORN WITH EITHER A WHITE OR BLACK WAISTCOAT
1031-133220-0093 FOR A DANCING PARTY OR FORMAL DINNER THE WHITE WAISTCOAT IS GENERALLY PREFERRED AND IF IT IS WORN IT MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY A WHITE LAWN TIE A MADE UP BOW IS CONSIDERED INCORRECT
1031-133220-0094 THE ACCOMPANIMENTS TO A SUIT OF THIS SORT ARE PATENT LEATHER SHOES AND WHITE KID GLOVES IF DANCING IS A PART OF THE EVENING PROGRAMME THE INFORMAL EVENING SUIT INCLUDES THE SHORTER DINNER JACKET OR TUXEDO AS IT WAS FORMERLY CALLED
1031-133220-0095 AND STRICTLY SPEAKING THIS IS ONLY CONSIDERED PROPER FOR THE CLUB OR FOR PARTIES WHERE LADIES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE PRESENT HOWEVER MEN WHO COMMONLY DRESS FOR DINNER IN THE HOME CIRCLE GENERALLY PREFER THE DINNER JACKET TO THE LONG COAT
1031-133220-0096 AND WELL DRESSED MEN ARE OFTEN SEEN WEARING IT AT SMALL DINNER PARTIES AT THE THEATER OR AT ANY INFORMAL EVENING EVENT THIS COAT IS ALWAYS WORN WITH A BLACK TIE AND WAISTCOAT
1031-133220-0097 AND IT IS NOT A SUITABLE APPAREL FOR A DANCE OR ANY LARGE FORMAL EVENING AFFAIR THE CORRECT DRESS FOR A DAYTIME WEDDING IS A BLACK FROCK COAT WITH LIGHT TROUSERS LIGHT FANCY WAISTCOAT
1031-133220-0098 AND GRAY GLOVES AND GRAY ASCOT OR FOUR IN HAND TIE
1031-133220-0099 OR WHEN MAKING AFTERNOON CALLS MANY YOUNG MEN ARE ADOPTING FOR AFTERNOON WEAR THE ENGLISH MORNING SUIT WHICH CONSISTS OF A CUTAWAY COAT WITH TROUSERS AND WAISTCOAT TO MATCH AND MADE OF SOME OTHER COLOR SAVE BLACK
