976-131541-0000 AND WHAT WILL BE THE END OF IT I CANNOT CALMLY REFLECT UPON IT I CANNOT SLEEP I MUST HAVE RECOURSE TO MY DIARY AGAIN I WILL COMMIT IT TO PAPER TO NIGHT
976-131541-0001 AND SEE WHAT I SHALL THINK OF IT TO MORROW I WENT DOWN TO DINNER RESOLVING TO BE CHEERFUL AND WELL CONDUCTED AND KEPT MY RESOLUTION VERY CREDITABLY CONSIDERING HOW MY HEAD ACHED
976-131541-0002 AND HOW INTERNALLY WRETCHED I FELT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS COME OVER ME OF LATE MY VERY ENERGIES BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL MUST BE STRANGELY IMPAIRED OR I SHOULD NOT HAVE ACTED SO WEAKLY
976-131541-0003 IN MANY RESPECTS AS I HAVE DONE BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN WELL THIS LAST DAY OR TWO I SUPPOSE IT IS WITH SLEEPING AND EATING SO LITTLE AND THINKING SO MUCH AND BEING SO CONTINUALLY OUT OF HUMOUR
976-131541-0004 BUT TO RETURN I WAS EXERTING MYSELF TO SING AND PLAY FOR THE AMUSEMENT AND AT THE REQUEST OF MY AUNT AND MILICENT BEFORE THE GENTLEMEN CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
976-131541-0005 MISS WILMOT NEVER LIKES TO WASTE HER MUSICAL EFFORTS ON LADIES EARS ALONE MILICENT HAD ASKED FOR A LITTLE SCOTCH SONG AND I WAS JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF IT WHEN THEY ENTERED
976-131541-0006 WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I HAVE BEEN HUNGERING AND THIRSTING ALL DAY FOR THE SOUND OF YOUR VOICE COME THE PIANO'S VACANT IT WAS FOR I HAD QUITTED IT IMMEDIATELY UPON HEARING HIS PETITION
976-131541-0007 HAD I BEEN ENDOWED WITH A PROPER DEGREE OF SELF POSSESSION I SHOULD HAVE TURNED TO THE LADY MYSELF AND CHEERFULLY JOINED MY ENTREATIES TO HIS WHEREBY I SHOULD HAVE DISAPPOINTED HIS EXPECTATIONS IF THE AFFRONT HAD BEEN PURPOSELY GIVEN
976-131541-0008 OR MADE HIM SENSIBLE OF THE WRONG IF IT HAD ONLY ARISEN FROM THOUGHTLESSNESS BUT I FELT IT TOO DEEPLY TO DO ANYTHING BUT RISE FROM THE MUSIC STOOL AND THROW MYSELF BACK ON THE SOFA SUPPRESSING WITH DIFFICULTY
976-131541-0009 THE AUDIBLE EXPRESSION OF THE BITTERNESS I FELT WITHIN I KNEW ANNABELLA'S MUSICAL TALENTS WERE SUPERIOR TO MINE BUT THAT WAS NO REASON WHY I SHOULD BE TREATED AS A PERFECT NONENTITY THE TIME
976-131541-0010 AND FAVOURED HIM WITH TWO OF HIS FAVOURITE SONGS IN SUCH SUPERIOR STYLE THAT EVEN I SOON LOST MY ANGER IN ADMIRATION AND LISTENED WITH A SORT OF GLOOMY PLEASURE TO THE SKILFUL MODULATIONS OF HER FULL TONED
976-131541-0011 AND DERIVED AN EQUAL OR SUPERIOR DELIGHT FROM THE CONTEMPLATION OF HIS SPEAKING COUNTENANCE AS HE STOOD BESIDE HER THAT EYE AND BROW LIGHTED UP WITH KEEN ENTHUSIASM
976-131541-0012 THERE NOW SAID SHE PLAYFULLY RUNNING HER FINGERS OVER THE KEYS WHEN SHE HAD CONCLUDED THE SECOND SONG WHAT SHALL I GIVE YOU NEXT BUT IN SAYING THIS
976-131541-0013 SHE LOOKED BACK AT LORD LOWBOROUGH WHO WAS STANDING A LITTLE BEHIND LEANING AGAINST THE BACK OF A CHAIR AN ATTENTIVE LISTENER TOO EXPERIENCING TO JUDGE BY HIS COUNTENANCE
976-131541-0014 MUCH THE SAME FEELINGS OF MINGLED PLEASURE AND SADNESS AS I DID BUT THE LOOK SHE GAVE HIM PLAINLY SAID DO YOU CHOOSE FOR ME NOW I HAVE DONE ENOUGH FOR HIM AND WILL GLADLY EXERT MYSELF TO GRATIFY YOU
976-131541-0015 AND THUS ENCOURAGED HIS LORDSHIP CAME FORWARD AND TURNING OVER THE MUSIC PRESENTLY SET BEFORE HER A LITTLE SONG THAT I HAD NOTICED BEFORE AND READ MORE THAN ONCE
976-131541-0016 OF MY CONNECTING IT IN MY MIND WITH THE REIGNING TYRANT OF MY THOUGHTS AND NOW WITH MY NERVES ALREADY EXCITED AND HALF UNSTRUNG I COULD NOT HEAR THOSE WORDS SO SWEETLY WARBLED FORTH
976-131541-0017 THE AIR WAS SIMPLE SWEET AND SAD IT IS STILL RUNNING IN MY HEAD AND SO ARE THE WORDS FAREWELL TO THEE BUT NOT FAREWELL TO ALL MY FONDEST THOUGHTS OF THEE
976-131541-0018 IF I MAY NE'ER BEHOLD AGAIN THAT FORM AND FACE SO DEAR TO ME NOR HEAR THY VOICE STILL WOULD I FAIN PRESERVE FOR AYE THEIR MEMORY THAT VOICE
976-131541-0019 THE MAGIC OF WHOSE TONE CAN WAKE AN ECHO IN MY BREAST CREATING FEELINGS THAT ALONE
976-131541-0020 THAT LAUGHING EYE WHOSE SUNNY BEAM MY MEMORY WOULD NOT CHERISH LESS
976-131541-0021 BUT STILL IT LINGERS IN MY HEART AND WHO CAN TELL BUT HEAVEN AT LAST MAY ANSWER ALL MY THOUSAND PRAYERS AND BID THE FUTURE PAY THE PAST WITH JOY FOR ANGUISH
976-131541-0022 SMILES FOR TEARS WHEN IT CEASED I LONGED FOR NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO BE OUT OF THE ROOM THE SOFA WAS NOT FAR FROM THE DOOR BUT I DID NOT DARE TO RAISE MY HEAD
976-131541-0023 FOR I KNEW MISTER HUNTINGDON WAS STANDING NEAR ME AND I KNEW BY THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE AS HE SPOKE IN ANSWER TO SOME REMARK OF LORD LOWBOROUGH'S THAT HIS FACE WAS TURNED TOWARDS ME PERHAPS
976-131541-0024 AND WHEN I THOUGHT HE HAD TURNED AWAY AGAIN ROSE AND INSTANTLY LEFT THE APARTMENT TAKING REFUGE IN MY FAVOURITE RESORT THE LIBRARY THERE WAS NO LIGHT THERE
976-131541-0025 BUT THE FAINT RED GLOW OF THE NEGLECTED FIRE BUT I DID NOT WANT A LIGHT I ONLY WANTED TO INDULGE MY THOUGHTS UNNOTICED AND UNDISTURBED AND SITTING DOWN ON A LOW STOOL BEFORE THE EASY CHAIR
976-131541-0026 I SUNK MY HEAD UPON ITS CUSHIONED SEAT AND THOUGHT AND THOUGHT UNTIL THE TEARS GUSHED OUT AGAIN AND I WEPT LIKE ANY CHILD PRESENTLY HOWEVER THE DOOR WAS GENTLY OPENED
976-131541-0027 AND SOMEONE ENTERED THE ROOM I TRUSTED IT WAS ONLY A SERVANT AND DID NOT STIR THE DOOR WAS CLOSED AGAIN BUT I WAS NOT ALONE A HAND GENTLY TOUCHED MY SHOULDER AND A VOICE SAID SOFTLY
976-131541-0028 WHAT IS THE MATTER I COULD NOT ANSWER AT THE MOMENT YOU MUST AND SHALL TELL ME WAS ADDED MORE VEHEMENTLY AND THE SPEAKER THREW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BESIDE ME ON THE RUG
976-131541-0029 BECAUSE IF YOU WERE I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU AND IF NOT I'LL GO GO THEN I CRIED BUT FEARING HE WOULD OBEY TOO WELL AND NEVER COME AGAIN I HASTILY ADDED
976-131541-0030 BUT WHICH SAID HE

976-131541-0033 AND I DID NOT INTERRUPT HIM AGAIN OR EVEN ATTEMPT TO REPULSE HIM THOUGH HE HAD TAKEN MY HAND ONCE MORE AND HALF EMBRACED ME WITH HIS OTHER ARM I WAS SCARCELY CONSCIOUS OF IT AT THE TIME
976-131541-0034 IT IS THIS RESUMED HE THAT ANNABELLA WILMOT IN COMPARISON WITH YOU IS LIKE A FLAUNTING PEONY COMPARED WITH A SWEET WILD ROSEBUD GEMMED WITH DEW AND I LOVE YOU
976-131541-0035 TO DISTRACTION NOW TELL ME IF THAT INTELLIGENCE GIVES YOU ANY PLEASURE SILENCE AGAIN THAT MEANS YES THEN LET ME ADD THAT I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT YOU
976-131541-0036 YOU WILL DRIVE ME MAD WILL YOU BESTOW YOURSELF UPON ME YOU WILL HE CRIED NEARLY SQUEEZING ME TO DEATH IN HIS ARMS NO NO I EXCLAIMED STRUGGLING TO FREE MYSELF FROM HIM
976-131541-0037 THEY WON'T REFUSE ME IF YOU DON'T I'M NOT SO SURE OF THAT MY AUNT DISLIKES YOU BUT YOU DON'T HELEN SAY YOU LOVE ME AND I'LL GO I WISH YOU WOULD GO I REPLIED
976-131541-0038 I WILL THIS INSTANT IF YOU'LL ONLY SAY YOU LOVE ME YOU KNOW I DO I ANSWERED AND AGAIN HE CAUGHT ME IN HIS ARMS AND SMOTHERED ME WITH KISSES AT THAT MOMENT
976-131541-0039 MY AUNT OPENED WIDE THE DOOR AND STOOD BEFORE US CANDLE IN HAND IN SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED AMAZEMENT GAZING ALTERNATELY AT MISTER HUNTINGDON AND ME FOR WE HAD BOTH STARTED UP
976-131541-0040 AND NOW STOOD WIDE ENOUGH ASUNDER BUT HIS CONFUSION WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT RALLYING IN AN INSTANT WITH THE MOST ENVIABLE ASSURANCE HE BEGAN
976-131541-0041 LET ME COMMEND MY CAUSE TO YOUR MOST INDULGENT NO INDULGENCE FOR YOU MISTER HUNTINGDON MUST COME BETWEEN ME AND THE CONSIDERATION OF MY NIECE'S HAPPINESS AH TRUE I KNOW SHE IS AN ANGEL
976-131541-0042 AND I AM A PRESUMPTUOUS DOG TO DREAM OF POSSESSING SUCH A TREASURE BUT NEVERTHELESS I WOULD SOONER DIE THAN RELINQUISH HER IN FAVOUR OF THE BEST MAN THAT EVER WENT TO HEAVEN AND AS FOR HER HAPPINESS
976-131541-0043 I WOULD SACRIFICE MY BODY AND SOUL BODY AND SOUL MISTER HUNTINGDON SACRIFICE YOUR SOUL WELL I WOULD LAY DOWN LIFE YOU WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO LAY IT DOWN
976-131541-0044 TO JUDGE MORE FAVOURABLY OF YOUR PRETENSIONS IF YOU TOO HAD CHOSEN ANOTHER TIME AND PLACE AND LET ME ADD ANOTHER MANNER FOR YOUR DECLARATION WHY YOU SEE MISSUS MAXWELL HE BEGAN
976-131541-0045 PARDON ME SIR SAID SHE WITH DIGNITY COMPANY ARE INQUIRING FOR YOU IN THE OTHER ROOM AND SHE TURNED TO ME THEN YOU MUST PLEAD FOR ME HELEN SAID HE AND AT LENGTH WITHDREW

976-131541-0047 I AM NOT ANGRY SHE REPLIED I AM SURPRISED IF IT IS TRUE THAT YOU TOLD HIM YOU COULD NOT ACCEPT HIS OFFER WITHOUT OUR CONSENT IT IS TRUE INTERRUPTED I THEN HOW COULD YOU PERMIT
976-131541-0048 TUMULTUOUS EXCITEMENT OF MY FEELINGS BUT MY GOOD AUNT WAS TOUCHED AT MY AGITATION IN A SOFTER TONE SHE REPEATED HER RECOMMENDATION TO RETIRE AND GENTLY KISSING MY FOREHEAD
976-131541-0049 BADE ME GOOD NIGHT AND PUT HER CANDLE IN MY HAND AND I WENT BUT MY BRAIN WORKED SO I COULD NOT THINK OF SLEEPING I FEEL CALMER NOW THAT I HAVE WRITTEN ALL THIS AND I WILL GO TO BED
