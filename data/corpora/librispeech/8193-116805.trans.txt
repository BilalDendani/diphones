8193-116805-0006 AND GIVE THEM CLOTHES AND THEY WERE GLAD WHEN THEY SAW THE WARM WATER FOR IT WAS LONG SINCE THEY HAD BATHED AND THEY WASHED OFF THE SEA SALT FROM THEIR LIMBS AND ANOINTED THEMSELVES FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH OIL AND COMBED OUT THEIR GOLDEN HAIR
8193-116805-0007 THEN THEY CAME BACK AGAIN INTO THE HALL WHILE THE MERCHANT KINGS ROSE UP TO DO THEM HONOUR AND EACH MAN SAID TO HIS NEIGHBOUR NO WONDER THAT THESE MEN WON FAME HOW THEY STAND NOW LIKE GIANTS OR TITANS OR IMMORTALS COME DOWN FROM OLYMPUS
8193-116805-0008 AND WE HAVE LOST OUR TWO SWIFT COMRADES THE SONS OF THE NORTH WIND BUT DO NOT THINK US COWARDS IF YOU WISH TO TRY OUR STRENGTH WE WILL SHOOT AND BOX AND WRESTLE AGAINST ANY MEN ON EARTH AND ALCINOUS SMILED AND ANSWERED
8193-116805-0009 AND RUNNING RACES TO STRETCH OUR LIMBS ON SHORE SO THEY DANCED THERE AND RAN RACES THE JOLLY MERCHANT KINGS TILL THE NIGHT FELL AND ALL WENT IN AND THEN THEY ATE AND DRANK AND COMFORTED THEIR WEARY SOULS
8193-116805-0010 TILL ALCINOUS CALLED A HERALD AND BADE HIM GO AND FETCH THE HARPER THE HERALD WENT OUT AND FETCHED THE HARPER AND LED HIM IN BY THE HAND AND ALCINOUS CUT HIM A PIECE OF MEAT FROM THE FATTEST OF THE HAUNCH AND SENT IT TO HIM
8193-116805-0011 THEN TELL ME HEROES ASKED ALCINOUS YOU WHO HAVE SAILED THE OCEAN ROUND AND SEEN THE MANNERS OF ALL NATIONS HAVE YOU SEEN SUCH DANCERS AS OURS HERE OR HEARD SUCH MUSIC AND SUCH SINGING

8193-116805-0014 AND ALL THE WOMEN WEPT AND THE MERCHANT KINGS ROSE UP EACH MAN FROM OFF HIS GOLDEN THRONE
8193-116805-0015 HAIL TO THE NOBLE ARGONAUTS WHO SAILED THE UNKNOWN SEAL THEN HE WENT ON AND TOLD THEIR JOURNEY OVER THE SLUGGISH NORTHERN MAIN AND THROUGH THE SHORELESS OUTER OCEAN TO THE FAIRY ISLAND OF THE WEST
8193-116805-0016 AND ALL THE WONDERS THEY HAD SEEN TILL MIDNIGHT PASSED AND THE DAY DAWNED BUT THE KINGS NEVER THOUGHT OF SLEEP EACH MAN SAT STILL AND LISTENED WITH HIS CHIN UPON HIS HAND AND AT LAST WHEN ORPHEUS HAD ENDED
8193-116805-0017 THEY ALL WENT THOUGHTFUL OUT AND THE HEROES LAY DOWN TO SLEEP BENEATH THE SOUNDING PORCH OUTSIDE
8193-116805-0018 FOR HER HEART WAS SOFTENED AND SHE SAID
8193-116805-0019 AFTER ALL SHE IS OUR GUEST AND MY SUPPLIANT AND PRAYERS ARE THE DAUGHTERS OF ZEUS AND WHO TOO DARE PART MAN AND WIFE AFTER ALL THEY HAVE ENDURED TOGETHER AND ALCINOUS SMILED
8193-116805-0020 THE MINSTREL'S SONG HAS CHARMED YOU BUT I MUST REMEMBER WHAT IS RIGHT FOR SONGS CANNOT ALTER JUSTICE AND I MUST BE FAITHFUL TO MY NAME ALCINOUS I AM CALLED THE MAN OF STURDY SENSE AND ALCINOUS I WILL BE
8193-116805-0021 AND THEY CAME AND STOOD OPPOSITE EACH OTHER BUT MEDEIA STAYED IN THE PALACE THEN ALCINOUS SPOKE HEROES OF THE COLCHI WHAT IS YOUR ERRAND ABOUT THIS LADY TO CARRY HER HOME WITH US THAT SHE MAY DIE A SHAMEFUL DEATH
8193-116805-0022 BUT IF WE RETURN WITHOUT HER WE MUST DIE THE DEATH SHE SHOULD HAVE DIED WHAT SAY YOU TO THIS JASON THE A EOLID SAID ALCINOUS TURNING TO THE MINUAI I SAY SAID THE CUNNING JASON
8193-116805-0023 AND SHE WILL ESCAPE IN HER DRAGON CAR OR IF NOT THUS SOME OTHER WAY FOR SHE HAS A THOUSAND PLANS AND WILES AND WHY RETURN HOME AT ALL BRAVE HEROES AND FACE THE LONG SEAS AGAIN AND THE BOSPHORUS AND THE STORMY EUXINE
8193-116805-0024 AND DOUBLE ALL YOUR TOIL THERE IS MANY A FAIR LAND ROUND THESE COASTS WHICH WAITS FOR GALLANT MEN LIKE YOU BETTER TO SETTLE THERE AND BUILD A CITY
8193-116805-0025 AND SOME CRIED HE HAS SPOKEN WELL AND SOME WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF ROVING WE WILL SAIL THE SEAS NO MORE AND THE CHIEF SAID AT LAST BE IT SO THEN A PLAGUE SHE HAS BEEN TO US AND A PLAGUE TO THE HOUSE OF HER FATHER
8193-116805-0026 AND A PLAGUE SHE WILL BE TO YOU TAKE HER SINCE YOU ARE NO WISER AND WE WILL SAIL AWAY TOWARD THE NORTH THEN ALCINOUS GAVE THEM FOOD AND WATER AND GARMENTS AND RICH PRESENTS OF ALL SORTS
8193-116805-0027 AND HE GAVE THE SAME TO THE MINUAI AND SENT THEM ALL AWAY IN PEACE SO JASON KEPT THE DARK WITCH MAIDEN TO BREED HIM WOE AND SHAME AND THE COLCHI WENT NORTHWARD INTO THE ADRIATIC AND SETTLED
8193-116805-0028 THROUGH THE DARKNESS AND THE BLINDING RAIN BUT WHERE THEY WERE THEY COULD NOT TELL AND THEY GAVE UP ALL HOPE OF LIFE AND AT LAST THEY TOUCHED THE GROUND AND WHEN DAYLIGHT CAME THEY WADED TO THE SHORE
8193-116805-0029 ON THE BURNING SHORE OF AFRICA AND THERE THEY WANDERED STARVING FOR MANY A WEARY DAY ERE THEY COULD LAUNCH THEIR SHIP AGAIN AND GAIN THE OPEN SEA AND THERE CANTHUS WAS KILLED WHILE HE WAS TRYING TO DRIVE OFF SHEEP
8193-116805-0030 BY A STONE WHICH A HERDSMAN THREW AND THERE TOO MOPSUS DIED THE SEER WHO KNEW THE VOICES OF ALL BIRDS BUT HE COULD NOT FORETELL HIS OWN END FOR HE WAS BITTEN IN THE FOOT BY A SNAKE
8193-116805-0031 ONE OF THOSE WHICH SPRANG FROM THE GORGON'S HEAD WHEN PERSEUS CARRIED IT ACROSS THE SANDS AT LAST THEY ROWED AWAY TOWARD THE NORTHWARD FOR MANY A WEARY DAY TILL THEIR WATER WAS SPENT AND THEIR FOOD EATEN
8193-116805-0032 AND THEY WERE WORN OUT WITH HUNGER AND THIRST BUT AT LAST THEY SAW A LONG STEEP ISLAND AND A BLUE PEAK HIGH AMONG THE CLOUDS AND THEY KNEW IT FOR THE PEAK OF IDA
8193-116805-0033 FOR ON A CAPE TO THE WESTWARD STOOD A GIANT TALLER THAN ANY MOUNTAIN PINE WHO GLITTERED ALOFT AGAINST THE SKY LIKE A TOWER OF BURNISHED BRASS HE TURNED AND LOOKED ON ALL SIDES ROUND HIM TILL HE SAW THE ARGO AND HER CREW
8193-116805-0034 AND WHEN HE SAW THEM HE CAME TOWARD THEM MORE SWIFTLY THAN THE SWIFTEST HORSE LEAPING ACROSS THE GLENS AT A BOUND AND STRIDING AT ONE STEP FROM DOWN TO DOWN AND WHEN HE CAME ABREAST OF THEM
8193-116805-0035 THEN THE GIANT RAN UP A VALLEY AND VANISHED AND THE HEROES LAY ON THEIR OARS IN FEAR BUT MEDEIA STOOD WATCHING ALL FROM UNDER HER STEEP BLACK BROWS WITH A CUNNING SMILE UPON HER LIPS
8193-116805-0036 IN HIS FORGE IN A ETNA BENEATH THE EARTH AND CALLED HIM TALUS AND GAVE HIM TO MINOS FOR A SERVANT TO GUARD THE COAST OF CRETE THRICE A DAY HE WALKS ROUND THE ISLAND AND NEVER STOPS TO SLEEP
8193-116805-0037 WHAT SHALL WE DO WISE MEDEIA WE MUST HAVE WATER OR WE DIE OF THIRST FLESH AND BLOOD WE CAN FACE FAIRLY BUT WHO CAN FACE THIS RED HOT BRASS I CAN FACE RED HOT BRASS IF THE TALE I HEAR BE TRUE
8193-116805-0038 FOR THEY SAY THAT HE HAS BUT ONE VEIN IN ALL HIS BODY FILLED WITH LIQUID FIRE AND THAT THIS VEIN IS CLOSED WITH A NAIL BUT I KNOW NOT WHERE THAT NAIL IS PLACED BUT IF I CAN GET IT ONCE INTO THESE HANDS
8193-116805-0039 FOR THEY WERE ASHAMED TO LEAVE HER SO ALONE BUT JASON SAID SHE IS DEARER TO ME THAN TO ANY OF YOU YET I WILL TRUST HER FREELY ON SHORE SHE HAS MORE PLOTS THAN WE CAN DREAM OF IN THE WINDINGS OF THAT FAIR AND CUNNING HEAD
8193-116805-0040 SO THEY LEFT THE WITCH MAIDEN ON THE SHORE AND SHE STOOD THERE IN HER BEAUTY ALL ALONE TILL THE GIANT STRODE BACK RED HOT FROM HEAD TO HEEL WHILE THE GRASS HISSED AND SMOKED BENEATH HIS TREAD
8193-116805-0041 THEN MEDEIA HELD UP A FLASK OF CRYSTAL AND SAID HERE IS THE ICHOR OF YOUTH I AM MEDEIA THE ENCHANTRESS
8193-116805-0042 FOR HIS FAME IS GONE OUT INTO ALL LANDS SO COME AND I WILL POUR THIS INTO YOUR VEINS THAT YOU MAY LIVE FOREVER YOUNG AND HE LISTENED TO HER FALSE WORDS THAT SIMPLE TALUS AND CAME NEAR AND MEDEIA SAID
8193-116805-0043 AND SHOWED HER THE SECRET NAIL AND SHE DREW THE NAIL OUT GENTLY BUT SHE POURED NO ICHOR IN AND INSTEAD THE LIQUID FIRE SPOUTED FORTH LIKE A STREAM OF RED HOT IRON AND TALUS TRIED TO LEAP UP CRYING
8193-116805-0044 YOU HAVE BETRAYED ME FALSE WITCH MAIDEN BUT SHE LIFTED UP HER HANDS BEFORE HIM AND SANG TILL HE SANK BENEATH HER SPELL AND AS HE SANK HIS BRAZEN LIMBS CLANKED HEAVILY AND THE EARTH GROANED BENEATH HIS WEIGHT
8193-116805-0045 AND THE LIQUID FIRE RAN FROM HIS HEEL LIKE A STREAM OF LAVA TO THE SEA AND MEDEIA LAUGHED AND CALLED TO THE HEROES COME ASHORE AND WATER YOUR SHIP IN PEACE SO THEY CAME AND FOUND THE GIANT LYING DEAD
8193-116805-0046 AT THE SOUTHWEST POINT OF THE PELOPONNESE AND THERE THEY OFFERED SACRIFICES AND ORPHEUS PURGED THEM FROM THEIR GUILT THEN THEY ROWED AWAY AGAIN TO THE NORTHWARD PAST THE LACONIAN SHORE AND CAME ALL WORN AND TIRED BY SUNIUM
8193-116805-0047 THEN JASON WENT UP WITH MEDEIA TO THE PALACE OF HIS UNCLE PELIAS AND WHEN HE CAME IN PELIAS SAT BY THE HEARTH CRIPPLED AND BLIND WITH AGE WHILE OPPOSITE HIM SAT A ESON JASON'S FATHER
8193-116805-0048 CRIPPLED AND BLIND LIKEWISE AND THE TWO OLD MEN'S HEADS SHOOK TOGETHER AS THEY TRIED TO WARM THEMSELVES BEFORE THE FIRE AND JASON FELL DOWN AT HIS FATHER'S KNEES AND WEPT AND CALLED HIM BY HIS NAME
8193-116805-0049 WHOM YOU TRUSTED TO THE CENTAUR UPON PELION AND I HAVE BROUGHT HOME THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND A PRINCESS OF THE SUN'S RACE FOR MY BRIDE SO NOW GIVE ME UP THE KINGDOM PELIAS MY UNCLE AND FULFIL YOUR PROMISE AS I HAVE FULFILLED MINE
