6269-66185-0001 AND WHAT I DID AND WHAT I DID NOT ARE MATTERS THAT DO NOT COME WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THESE PAGES BUT BEFORE I WRITE FINIS TO THE RECORD AS IT STANDS
6269-66185-0002 AS IF I WERE ONCE MORE GOING AWAY FROM MY BOYHOOD I HAVE A WORD OR TWO TO SAY CONCERNING A FEW OF THE PERSONAGES WHO HAVE FIGURED IN THE STORY IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO CALL GYPSY A PERSONAGE
6269-66185-0003 I AM SURE THAT THE READER WHO HAS FOLLOWED ME THUS FAR WILL BE WILLING TO HEAR WHAT BECAME OF HER AND SAILOR BEN AND MISS ABIGAIL AND THE CAPTAIN FIRST ABOUT GYPSY
6269-66185-0004 A MONTH AFTER MY DEPARTURE FROM RIVERMOUTH THE CAPTAIN INFORMED ME BY LETTER THAT HE HAD PARTED WITH THE LITTLE MARE ACCORDING TO AGREEMENT SHE HAD BEEN SOLD TO THE RING MASTER OF A TRAVELLING CIRCUS
6269-66185-0005 I HAD STIPULATED ON THIS DISPOSAL OF HER AND WAS ABOUT TO SET OUT ON HER TRAVELS SHE DID NOT DISAPPOINT MY GLOWING ANTICIPATIONS BUT BECAME QUITE A CELEBRITY IN HER WAY BY DANCING THE POLKA TO SLOW MUSIC
6269-66185-0006 ON A PINE BOARD BALL ROOM CONSTRUCTED FOR THE PURPOSE I CHANCED ONCE A LONG WHILE AFTERWARDS TO BE IN A COUNTRY TOWN WHERE HER TROUPE WAS GIVING EXHIBITIONS
6269-66185-0007 OF ZULEIKA THE FAMED ARABIAN TRICK PONY BUT I FAILED TO RECOGNIZE MY DEAR LITTLE MUSTANG GIRL BEHIND THOSE HIGH SOUNDING TITLES AND SO ALAS DID NOT ATTEND THE PERFORMANCE
6269-66185-0008 I HOPE ALL THE PRAISES SHE RECEIVED AND ALL THE SPANGLED TRAPPINGS SHE WORE DID NOT SPOIL HER BUT I AM AFRAID THEY DID FOR SHE WAS ALWAYS OVER MUCH GIVEN TO THE VANITIES OF THIS WORLD
6269-66185-0009 MISS ABIGAIL REGULATED THE DOMESTIC DESTINIES OF MY GRANDFATHER'S HOUSEHOLD UNTIL THE DAY OF HER DEATH WHICH DOCTOR THEOPHILUS TREDICK SOLEMNLY AVERRED WAS HASTENED
6269-66185-0010 BY THE INVETERATE HABIT SHE HAD CONTRACTED OF SWALLOWING UNKNOWN QUANTITIES OF HOT DROPS WHENEVER SHE FANCIED HERSELF OUT OF SORTS EIGHTY SEVEN EMPTY PHIALS WERE FOUND IN A BONNET BOX ON A SHELF IN HER BEDROOM CLOSET
6269-66185-0011 THE OLD HOUSE BECAME VERY LONELY WHEN THE FAMILY GOT REDUCED TO CAPTAIN NUTTER AND KITTY AND WHEN KITTY PASSED AWAY MY GRANDFATHER DIVIDED HIS TIME BETWEEN RIVERMOUTH AND NEW YORK
6269-66185-0012 SAILOR BEN DID NOT LONG SURVIVE HIS LITTLE IRISH LASS AS HE ALWAYS FONDLY CALLED HER AT HIS DEMISE WHICH TOOK PLACE ABOUT SIX YEARS SINCE HE LEFT HIS PROPERTY IN TRUST TO THE MANAGERS
6269-66185-0013 OF A HOME FOR AGED MARINERS IN HIS WILL WHICH WAS A VERY WHIMSICAL DOCUMENT WRITTEN BY HIMSELF AND WORDED WITH MUCH SHREWDNESS TOO HE WARNED THE TRUSTEES THAT WHEN HE GOT ALOFT
6269-66185-0014 HE INTENDED TO KEEP HIS WEATHER EYE ON THEM AND SHOULD SEND A SPERITUAL SHOT ACROSS THEIR BOWS AND BRING THEM TO IF THEY DIDN'T TREAT THE AGED MARINERS HANDSOMELY HE ALSO EXPRESSED A WISH TO HAVE HIS BODY STITCHED UP
6269-66185-0015 IN A SHOTTED HAMMOCK AND DROPPED INTO THE HARBOR BUT AS HE DID NOT STRENUOUSLY INSIST ON THIS AND AS IT WAS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH MY GRANDFATHER'S PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS OF CHRISTIAN BURIAL
6269-66185-0016 THE ADMIRAL WAS LAID TO REST BESIDE KITTY IN THE OLD SOUTH BURYING GROUND WITH AN ANCHOR THAT WOULD HAVE DELIGHTED HIM NEATLY CARVED ON HIS HEADSTONE I AM SORRY THE FIRE HAS GONE OUT
6269-66185-0017 FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER LEAVING RIVERMOUTH I CARRIED ON A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH PEPPER WHITCOMB BUT IT GRADUALLY DWINDLED DOWN TO A SINGLE LETTER A MONTH AND THEN TO NONE AT ALL
6269-66185-0018 HE KEPT ME ADVISED OF THE CURRENT GOSSIP OF THE TOWN AND THE DOINGS OF THE CENTIPEDES AS ONE BY ONE THE BOYS LEFT THE ACADEMY ADAMS HARRIS MARDEN BLAKE AND LANGDON TO SEEK THEIR FORTUNES ELSEWHERE
6269-66185-0019 THERE WAS LESS TO INTEREST ME IN THE OLD SEAPORT AND WHEN PEPPER HIMSELF WENT TO PHILADELPHIA TO READ LAW I HAD NO ONE TO GIVE ME AN INKLING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE WASN'T MUCH TO GO ON TO BE SURE
6269-66185-0020 GREAT EVENTS NO LONGER CONSIDERED IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO HONOR SO QUIET A PLACE ONE FOURTH OF JULY THE TEMPLE GRAMMAR SCHOOL BURNT DOWN SET ON FIRE IT WAS SUPPOSED BY AN ECCENTRIC SQUIB
6269-66185-0021 THAT WAS SEEN TO BOLT INTO AN UPPER WINDOW AND MISTER GRIMSHAW RETIRED FROM PUBLIC LIFE MARRIED AND LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER AS THE STORY BOOKS SAY
6269-66185-0022 THE WIDOW CONWAY I AM ABLE TO STATE DID NOT SUCCEED IN ENSLAVING MISTER MEEKS THE APOTHECARY WHO UNITED HIMSELF CLANDESTINELY TO ONE OF MISS DOROTHY GIBBS'S YOUNG LADIES AND LOST THE PATRONAGE
6269-66185-0023 AND HAD HALF A MIND TO POP INTO THE SHOP AND SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM AND ASK HIM IF HE WANTED TO FIGHT I CONTENTED MYSELF HOWEVER WITH FLATTENING MY NOSE AGAINST HIS DINGY SHOP WINDOW AND BEHELD CONWAY IN RED WHISKERS AND BLUE OVERALLS
6269-66185-0024 GIVING HIM SHORT WEIGHT I'LL BET ANYTHING I HAVE RESERVED MY PLEASANTEST WORD FOR THE LAST IT IS TOUCHING THE CAPTAIN THE CAPTAIN IS STILL HALE AND ROSY AND IF HE DOESN'T RELATE HIS EXPLOIT
6269-66185-0025 IN THE WAR OF EIGHTEEN TWELVE AS SPIRITEDLY AS HE USED TO HE MAKES UP BY RELATING IT MORE FREQUENTLY AND TELLING IT DIFFERENTLY EVERY TIME HE PASSES HIS WINTERS IN NEW YORK
6269-66185-0026 AND HIS SUMMERS IN THE NUTTER HOUSE WHICH THREATENS TO PROVE A HARD NUT FOR THE DESTRUCTIVE GENTLEMAN WITH THE SCYTHE AND THE HOUR GLASS FOR THE SEAWARD GABLE HAS NOT YIELDED A CLAPBOARD TO THE EASTWIND THESE TWENTY YEARS
6269-66185-0027 THE CAPTAIN HAS NOW BECOME THE OLDEST INHABITANT IN RIVERMOUTH AND SO I DON'T LAUGH AT THE OLDEST INHABITANT ANY MORE BUT PRAY IN MY HEART THAT HE MAY OCCUPY THE POST OF HONOR FOR HALF A CENTURY TO COME
6269-66185-0028 SO ENDS THE STORY OF A BAD BOY
