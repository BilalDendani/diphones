8778-246974-0000 THEY MADE HIM FEEL LIKE A RABBIT THAT WAS TOO FAR FROM ITS HOLE HE SAID AND HE WAS NEVER TEMPTED TO TRY IT AGAIN REGULARLY TOO EVERY DAY ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK
8778-246974-0001 THE GNOME LIKE FORM OF THE GATE KEEPER WOULD ISSUE FROM THE LITTLE DOOR IN THE PARK FENCE AND COME MARCHING ACROSS THE GRASS TOWARDS LEOPOLD'S CHAIR WHICH WAS SET NEAR THE SMALL CLUMP OF TREES ALREADY MENTIONED
8778-246974-0002 NOT TALKING MUCH TO THE INVALID
8778-246974-0003 SOMETIMES HE WOULD TAKE REFUGE FROM THE HEAT WHICH THE INDIAN NEVER FELT TOO GREAT AMONGST THE TREES AND THERE WOULD GENERALLY BE THINKING OUT WHAT HE WANTED TO SAY TO HIS PEOPLE THE NEXT SUNDAY
8778-246974-0004 ONE THING HE FOUND STRANGE AND COULD NOT SATISFY HIMSELF CONCERNING NAMELY THAT ALTHOUGH HIS MIND WAS SO MUCH OCCUPIED
8778-246974-0005 BUT THE THING THAT DID CARRY HIM THROUGH
8778-246974-0006 HIS FAITH IN GOD WAS ALL THE TIME GROWING
8778-246974-0007 THROUGH WHAT SEEMED AT THE TIME ONLY A SUCCESSION OF INTERRUPTIONS
8778-246974-0008 AS SATISFACTION WITH APPARENT ACHIEVEMENT THAT EVER SOUNDS A HALT BUT WINGFOLD'S EXPERIENCE WAS THAT NO SOONER
8778-246974-0009 DID HE SET HIS FOOT ON THE LOWEST HILLOCK OF SELF CONGRATULATION THAN SOME FRESH DIFFICULTY CAME THAT THREW HIM PROSTRATE AND HE ROSE AGAIN ONLY IN THE STRENGTH OF THE NECESSITY
8778-246974-0010 THAT HIS FAITH MUST BE AN ABSOLUTE ONE CLAIMING FROM GOD EVERYTHING THE LOVE OF A PERFECT FATHER COULD GIVE OR THE NEEDS HE HAD CREATED IN HIS CHILD COULD DESIRE
8778-246974-0011 THAT HE MUST NOT LOOK TO HIMSELF FIRST FOR HELP OR IMAGINE THAT THE DIVINE WAS ONLY THE SUPPLEMENT TO THE WEAKNESS AND FAILURE OF THE HUMAN THAT THE HIGHEST EFFORT OF THE HUMAN
8778-246974-0012 WAS TO LAY HOLD OF THE DIVINE HE LEARNED THAT HE COULD KEEP NO SIMPLEST LAW IN ITS LOVELINESS UNTIL HE WAS POSSESSED OF THE SAME SPIRIT WHENCE THAT LAW SPRUNG
8778-246974-0013 THAT HE COULD NOT LOVE HELEN ARIGHT SIMPLY PERFECTLY UNSELFISHLY EXCEPT THROUGH THE PRESENCE OF THE ORIGINATING LOVE THAT THE ONE THING WHEREIN HE MIGHT IMITATE THE FREE CREATIVE
8778-246974-0014 THAT MADE HIM STRONG IN THE MIDST OF WEAKNESS WHEN THE SON OF MAN IN HIM CRIED OUT LET THIS CUP PASS THE SON OF GOD IN HIM
8778-246974-0015 HE COULD INHABIT TREMBLING AND YET BE BRAVE
8778-246974-0016 GENERALLY CAME TO THE MEADOW TO SEE HOW THE INVALID WAS AFTER HE WAS SETTLED BUT SHE SELDOM STAID SHE WAS NOT FOND OF NURSING NEITHER WAS THERE ANY NEED OF HER ASSISTANCE
8778-246974-0017 GENTLY AND MODESTLY ALMOST SHYLY SHE CAME UP TO HELEN MADE HER A COURTESY LIKE A VILLAGE SCHOOL GIRL AND SAID WHILE SHE GLANCED AT LEOPOLD NOW AND THEN
8778-246974-0018 AND HE SAID NO I AM NOT EXACTLY PRAYING FOR HIM BUT I AM THINKING OF GOD AND HIM TOGETHER THE TEARS ROSE IN LEOPOLD'S EYES RACHEL LIFTED HER BABY HAND
8778-246974-0019 AND STROKED THE DUSKY LONG FINGERED ONE THAT LAY UPON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR DEAR MISTER LINGARD SHE SAID HELEN STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EMBROIDERY STITCH
8778-246974-0020 DO YOU SUFFER THEN HE SAID JUST LOOK AT ME SHE ANSWERED WITH A SMILE THAT WAS VERY PITIFUL THOUGH SHE DID NOT MEAN IT FOR SUCH SHUT UP ALL MY LIFE IN THIS EPITOME OF DEFORMITY
8778-246974-0021 BUT I AIN'T GRUMBLING THAT WOULD BE A FINE THING MY HOUSE IS NOT SO SMALL BUT GOD CAN GET INTO IT ONLY YOU CAN'T THINK HOW TIRED I OFTEN AM OF IT
8778-246974-0022 MISTER WINGFOLD WAS TELLING ME YESTERDAY THAT SOME PEOPLE FANCY SAINT PAUL WAS LITTLE AND MISSHAPEN AND THAT THAT WAS HIS THORN IN THE FLESH I DON'T THINK THAT CAN BE TRUE
8778-246974-0023 SOMETHING NOT QUITE SO FAR OFF YOUR SISTER'S THERE MISTER LINGARD BUT I'M ASHAMED OF TALKING LIKE THIS IT CAME OF WANTING TO TELL YOU I CAN'T BE SORRY YOU ARE GOING WHEN I SHOULD SO DEARLY LIKE
8778-246974-0024 BUT WHEN I AM GONE THE WORLD WILL BE THE CLEANER FOR IT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT GOD THE SAME WAY YOUR UNCLE DOES MISS POLWARTH I HOPE I DO A LITTLE
8778-246974-0025 BUT GOD KNOWS ABOUT US ALL THE SAME AND HE DON'T LIMIT HIS GOODNESS TO US BY OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HIM IT'S SO WONDERFUL
8778-246974-0026 THAT IS HIS GODNESS YOU KNOW WE CAN'T BE ALL TO ANY ONE PERSON
8778-246974-0027 WE ARE ALL IN BITS AND SPOTS BUT I FANCY IT'S A SIGN THAT WE COME OF GOD THAT WE DON'T LIKE IT HOW GLADLY I WOULD HELP YOU MISTER LINGARD AND I CAN DO NOTHING FOR YOU
8778-246974-0028 I'M AFRAID YOUR BEAUTIFUL SISTER THINKS ME VERY FORWARD BUT SHE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO LIE AWAKE ALL NIGHT SOMETIMES THINK THINKING ABOUT MY BEAUTIFUL BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8778-246974-0029 THAT I CAN'T GET NEAR TO DO ANYTHING FOR WHAT AN ODD CREATURE THOUGHT HELEN TO WHOM HER TALK CONVEYED NEXT TO NOTHING BUT I DARESAY
8778-246974-0030 I BEG YOUR PARDON AGAIN FOR TALKING SO MUCH CONCLUDED RACHEL
