1050-134119-0000 THE PETERKINS AT THE FARM IT MAY BE REMEMBERED THAT THE PETERKINS ORIGINALLY HESITATED ABOUT PUBLISHING THEIR FAMILY PAPERS AND WERE DECIDED BY REFERRING THE MATTER TO THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA
1050-134119-0001 A LITTLE UNCERTAIN OF WHETHER SHE MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE AT PHILADELPHIA THEY DETERMINED TO WRITE AND ASK HER SOLOMON JOHN SUGGESTED A POSTAL CARD EVERYBODY READS A POSTAL AND EVERYBODY WOULD READ IT AS IT CAME ALONG AND SEE ITS IMPORTANCE AND HELP IT ON
1050-134119-0002 IF THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA WERE AWAY
1050-134119-0003 ELIZABETH ELIZA THOUGHT THE POSTAL A BRIGHT IDEA
1050-134119-0004 AGAMEMNON AND SOLOMON JOHN TOOK THE POSTAL CARD TO THE POST OFFICE EARLY ONE MORNING AND BY THE AFTERNOON OF THAT VERY DAY AND ALL THE NEXT DAY AND FOR MANY DAYS CAME STREAMING IN ANSWERS ON POSTALS AND ON LETTERS
1050-134119-0005 THEIR CARD HAD BEEN ADDRESSED TO THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA WITH THE NUMBER OF HER STREET
1050-134119-0006 BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN READ BY THEIR NEIGHBORS IN THEIR OWN TOWN POST OFFICE BEFORE LEAVING IT MUST HAVE BEEN READ ALONG ITS WAY FOR BY EACH MAIL CAME PILES OF POSTALS AND LETTERS FROM TOWN AFTER TOWN IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION AND ALL IN THE SAME TONE
1050-134119-0007 YES YES PUBLISH THE ADVENTURES OF THE PETERKIN FAMILY PUBLISH THEM OF COURSE AND IN TIME CAME THE ANSWER OF THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA YES OF COURSE PUBLISH THEM THIS IS WHY THEY WERE PUBLISHED
1050-134119-0008 THIS WAS MISSUS PETERKIN IT WAS A MISTAKE SHE HAD POURED OUT A DELICIOUS CUP OF COFFEE AND JUST AS SHE WAS HELPING HERSELF TO CREAM
1050-134119-0009 IT TASTED BAD WHAT SHOULD SHE DO OF COURSE SHE COULDN'T DRINK THE COFFEE SO SHE CALLED IN THE FAMILY
1050-134119-0010 THE FAMILY CAME IN THEY ALL TASTED AND LOOKED AND WONDERED WHAT SHOULD BE DONE AND ALL SAT DOWN TO THINK AT LAST AGAMEMNON WHO HAD BEEN TO COLLEGE SAID WHY DON'T WE GO OVER AND ASK THE ADVICE OF THE CHEMIST
1050-134119-0011 FOR THE CHEMIST LIVED OVER THE WAY AND WAS A VERY WISE MAN MISSUS PETERKIN SAID YES AND MISTER PETERKIN SAID VERY WELL AND ALL THE CHILDREN SAID THEY WOULD GO TOO
1050-134119-0012 SO THE LITTLE BOYS PUT ON THEIR INDIA RUBBER BOOTS AND OVER THEY WENT NOW THE CHEMIST WAS JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT SOMETHING
1050-134119-0013 AND HE HAD A LARGE GLASS BOTTLE INTO WHICH HE PUT ALL KINDS OF GOLD AND SILVER AND MANY OTHER VALUABLE THINGS AND MELTED THEM ALL UP OVER THE FIRE TILL HE HAD ALMOST FOUND WHAT HE WANTED
1050-134119-0014 HE COULD TURN THINGS INTO ALMOST GOLD BUT JUST NOW HE HAD USED UP ALL THE GOLD THAT HE HAD ROUND THE HOUSE AND GOLD WAS HIGH HE HAD USED UP HIS WIFE'S GOLD THIMBLE
1050-134119-0015 AND HIS GREAT GRANDFATHER'S GOLD BOWED SPECTACLES AND HE HAD MELTED UP THE GOLD HEAD OF HIS GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER'S CANE
1050-134119-0016 HE WAS DOWN ON HIS KNEES BEFORE HIS WIFE ASKING HER TO LET HIM HAVE HER WEDDING RING
1050-134119-0017 AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO TURN EVERYTHING INTO GOLD AND THEN SHE COULD HAVE A NEW WEDDING RING OF DIAMONDS ALL SET IN EMERALDS AND RUBIES AND TOPAZES AND ALL THE FURNITURE COULD BE TURNED INTO THE FINEST OF GOLD
1050-134119-0018 NOW HIS WIFE WAS JUST CONSENTING WHEN THE PETERKIN FAMILY BURST IN YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW MAD THE CHEMIST WAS HE CAME NEAR THROWING HIS CRUCIBLE THAT WAS THE NAME OF HIS MELTING POT AT THEIR HEADS BUT HE DIDN'T
1050-134119-0019 HE LISTENED AS CALMLY AS HE COULD TO THE STORY OF HOW MISSUS PETERKIN HAD PUT SALT IN HER COFFEE AT FIRST HE SAID HE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT WHEN AGAMEMNON SAID THEY WOULD PAY IN GOLD IF HE WOULD ONLY GO
1050-134119-0020 HE PACKED UP HIS BOTTLES IN A LEATHER CASE AND WENT BACK WITH THEM ALL FIRST HE LOOKED AT THE COFFEE AND THEN STIRRED IT THEN HE PUT IN A LITTLE CHLORATE OF POTASSIUM AND THE FAMILY TRIED IT ALL ROUND BUT IT TASTED NO BETTER
1050-134119-0021 BUT MISSUS PETERKIN DIDN'T LIKE THAT THEN HE ADDED SOME TARTARIC ACID AND SOME HYPERSULPHATE OF LIME BUT NO IT WAS NO BETTER I HAVE IT EXCLAIMED THE CHEMIST A LITTLE AMMONIA IS JUST THE THING
1050-134119-0022 NO IT WASN'T THE THING AT ALL THEN HE TRIED EACH IN TURN SOME OXALIC CYANIC ACETIC PHOSPHORIC CHLORIC HYPERCHLORIC SULPHURIC BORACIC
1050-134119-0023 MISSUS PETERKIN TASTED EACH AND SAID THE FLAVOR WAS PLEASANT BUT NOT PRECISELY THAT OF COFFEE
1050-134119-0024 UNGRATEFULLY SAID IT TASTED OF ANYTHING BUT COFFEE THE CHEMIST WAS NOT DISCOURAGED HE PUT IN A LITTLE BELLADONNA AND ATROPINE SOME GRANULATED HYDROGEN SOME POTASH
1050-134119-0025 AND A VERY LITTLE ANTIMONY FINISHING OFF WITH A LITTLE PURE CARBON BUT STILL MISSUS PETERKIN WAS NOT SATISFIED
1050-134119-0026 THE THEORY REMAINED THE SAME ALTHOUGH THE EXPERIMENT HAD FAILED PERHAPS A LITTLE STARCH WOULD HAVE SOME EFFECT IF NOT THAT WAS ALL THE TIME HE COULD GIVE HE SHOULD LIKE TO BE PAID AND GO THEY WERE ALL MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM AND WILLING TO GIVE HIM
1050-134119-0027 SO MISTER PETERKIN FOUND IN THE NEWSPAPER THIS GAVE AGAMEMNON A PRETTY LITTLE SUM HE SAT HIMSELF DOWN TO DO IT BUT THERE WAS THE COFFEE ALL SAT AND THOUGHT AWHILE TILL ELIZABETH ELIZA SAID
1050-134119-0028 ELIZABETH ELIZA WAS THE ONLY DAUGHTER SHE WAS NAMED AFTER HER TWO AUNTS ELIZABETH FROM THE SISTER OF HER FATHER ELIZA FROM HER MOTHER'S SISTER NOW THE HERB WOMAN WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO CAME ROUND TO SELL HERBS
1050-134119-0029 AND KNEW A GREAT DEAL THEY ALL SHOUTED WITH JOY AT THE IDEA OF ASKING HER AND SOLOMON JOHN AND THE YOUNGER CHILDREN AGREED TO GO AND FIND HER TOO
1050-134119-0030 SO THE BOYS PUT ON THEIR INDIA RUBBER BOOTS AGAIN AND THEY SET OFF IT WAS A LONG WALK THROUGH THE VILLAGE BUT THEY CAME AT LAST TO THE HERB WOMAN'S HOUSE AT THE FOOT OF A HIGH HILL THEY WENT THROUGH HER LITTLE GARDEN
1050-134119-0031 AND A BRANDY CHERRY TREE SHADED THE DOOR AND A LUXURIANT CRANBERRY VINE FLUNG ITS DELICIOUS FRUIT ACROSS THE WINDOW THEY WENT INTO A SMALL PARLOR WHICH SMELT VERY SPICY
1050-134119-0032 ALL AROUND HUNG LITTLE BAGS FULL OF CATNIP AND PEPPERMINT AND ALL KINDS OF HERBS AND DRIED STALKS HUNG FROM THE CEILING AND ON THE SHELVES WERE JARS OF RHUBARB SENNA MANNA AND THE LIKE
1050-134119-0033 BUT THERE WAS NO LITTLE OLD WOMAN SHE HAD GONE UP INTO THE WOODS TO GET SOME MORE WILD HERBS SO THEY ALL THOUGHT THEY WOULD FOLLOW HER ELIZABETH ELIZA SOLOMON JOHN AND THE LITTLE BOYS
1050-134119-0034 BUT THE LITTLE BOYS HAD THEIR INDIA RUBBER BOOTS AT LAST THEY DISCOVERED THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN THEY KNEW HER BY HER HAT IT WAS STEEPLE CROWNED WITHOUT ANY VANE THEY SAW HER DIGGING WITH HER TROWEL ROUND A SASSAFRAS BUSH
1050-134119-0035 AND WOULDN'T SHE COME AND SEE WHAT SHE COULD DO
1050-134119-0036 AND WENT BACK TO HER HOUSE THERE SHE STOPPED AND STUFFED HER HUGE POCKETS WITH SOME OF ALL THE KINDS OF HERBS SHE TOOK SOME TANSY AND PEPPERMINT AND CARAWAY SEED AND DILL SPEARMINT AND CLOVES
1050-134119-0037 WILD THYME AND SOME OF THE OTHER TIME SUCH AS YOU HAVE IN CLOCKS SAPPERMINT AND OPPERMINT CATNIP VALERIAN AND HOP
1050-134119-0038 INDEED THERE ISN'T A KIND OF HERB YOU CAN THINK OF THAT THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN DIDN'T HAVE DONE UP IN HER LITTLE PAPER BAGS
1050-134119-0039 WITH THE CHILDREN TAKING HER STICK MEANWHILE MISSUS PETERKIN WAS GETTING QUITE IMPATIENT FOR HER COFFEE
1050-134119-0040 THEN SHE TRIED A LITTLE FLAGROOT AND SNAKEROOT THEN SOME SPRUCE GUM AND SOME CARAWAY AND SOME DILL SOME RUE AND ROSEMARY
1050-134119-0041 AND SOUR SOME OPPERMINT AND SAPPERMINT A LITTLE SPEARMINT AND PEPPERMINT SOME WILD THYME AND SOME OF THE OTHER TAME TIME
1050-134119-0042 THE CHILDREN TASTED AFTER EACH MIXTURE BUT MADE UP DREADFUL FACES MISSUS PETERKIN TASTED AND DID THE SAME THE MORE THE OLD WOMAN STIRRED AND THE MORE SHE PUT IN
1050-134119-0043 SO THE OLD WOMAN SHOOK HER HEAD AND MUTTERED A FEW WORDS AND SAID SHE MUST GO SHE BELIEVED THE COFFEE WAS BEWITCHED SHE BUNDLED UP HER PACKETS OF HERBS AND TOOK HER TROWEL
1050-134119-0044 AND HER BASKET AND HER STICK AND WENT BACK TO HER ROOT OF SASSAFRAS THAT SHE HAD LEFT HALF IN THE AIR AND HALF OUT AND ALL SHE WOULD TAKE FOR PAY WAS FIVE CENTS IN CURRENCY
1050-134119-0045 THEN THE FAMILY WERE IN DESPAIR AND ALL SAT AND THOUGHT A GREAT WHILE
1050-134119-0046 AT LAST ELIZABETH ELIZA SAID THEY SAY THAT THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA WHO IS STAYING IN TOWN IS VERY WISE SUPPOSE I GO AND ASK HER WHAT IS BEST TO BE DONE TO THIS THEY ALL AGREED IT WAS A GREAT THOUGHT
1050-134119-0047 AND OFF ELIZABETH ELIZA WENT SHE TOLD THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA THE WHOLE STORY HOW HER MOTHER HAD PUT SALT IN THE COFFEE HOW THE CHEMIST HAD BEEN CALLED IN HOW HE TRIED EVERYTHING BUT COULD MAKE IT NO BETTER
1050-134119-0048 AND HOW THEY WENT FOR THE LITTLE OLD HERB WOMAN AND HOW SHE HAD TRIED IN VAIN FOR HER MOTHER COULDN'T DRINK THE COFFEE THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA LISTENED VERY ATTENTIVELY AND THEN SAID
