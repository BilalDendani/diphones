846-130986-0000 ADVANTAGE OF THE UNION IN RESPECT TO ECONOMY IN GOVERNMENT FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH
846-130986-0001 AS CONNECTED WITH THE SUBJECT OF REVENUE WE MAY WITH PROPRIETY CONSIDER THAT OF ECONOMY THE MONEY SAVED FROM ONE OBJECT MAY BE USEFULLY APPLIED TO ANOTHER
846-130986-0002 AND THERE WILL BE SO MUCH THE LESS TO BE DRAWN FROM THE POCKETS OF THE PEOPLE IF THE STATES ARE UNITED UNDER ONE GOVERNMENT THERE WILL BE BUT ONE NATIONAL CIVIL LIST TO SUPPORT IF THEY ARE DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL CONFEDERACIES
846-130986-0003 AND EACH OF THEM AS TO THE PRINCIPAL DEPARTMENTS
846-130986-0004 IS A PROJECT TOO EXTRAVAGANT AND TOO REPLETE WITH DANGER TO HAVE MANY ADVOCATES THE IDEAS OF MEN WHO SPECULATE UPON THE DISMEMBERMENT OF THE EMPIRE SEEM GENERALLY TURNED TOWARD THREE CONFEDERACIES
846-130986-0005 ONE CONSISTING OF THE FOUR NORTHERN ANOTHER OF THE FOUR MIDDLE AND A THIRD OF THE FIVE SOUTHERN STATES THERE IS LITTLE PROBABILITY THAT THERE WOULD BE A GREATER NUMBER
846-130986-0006 ACCORDING TO THIS DISTRIBUTION EACH CONFEDERACY WOULD COMPRISE AN EXTENT OF TERRITORY LARGER THAN THAT OF THE KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN NO WELL INFORMED MAN
846-130986-0007 WHEN THE DIMENSIONS OF A STATE ATTAIN TO A CERTAIN MAGNITUDE IT REQUIRES THE SAME ENERGY OF GOVERNMENT AND THE SAME FORMS OF ADMINISTRATION
846-130986-0008 WHICH ARE REQUISITE IN ONE OF MUCH GREATER EXTENT THIS IDEA ADMITS NOT OF PRECISE DEMONSTRATION BECAUSE THERE IS NO RULE BY WHICH WE CAN MEASURE THE MOMENTUM OF CIVIL POWER NECESSARY
846-130986-0009 TO THE PUBLIC GOOD WE SHALL SEE NO REASON TO DOUBT THAT THE LIKE PORTION OF POWER WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO PERFORM THE SAME TASK IN A SOCIETY FAR MORE NUMEROUS CIVIL POWER PROPERLY ORGANIZED AND EXERTED
846-130986-0010 IS CAPABLE OF DIFFUSING ITS FORCE TO A VERY GREAT EXTENT AND CAN IN A MANNER REPRODUCE ITSELF IN EVERY PART OF A GREAT EMPIRE BY A JUDICIOUS ARRANGEMENT OF SUBORDINATE
846-130986-0011 AND COMMERCIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE HABITS AND PREJUDICES OF THE DIFFERENT STATES WE SHALL BE LED TO CONCLUDE
846-130986-0012 THEY WILL MOST NATURALLY LEAGUE THEMSELVES UNDER TWO GOVERNMENTS THE FOUR EASTERN STATES FROM ALL THE CAUSES THAT FORM THE LINKS OF NATIONAL SYMPATHY AND CONNECTION MAY WITH CERTAINTY BE EXPECTED TO UNITE
846-130986-0013 NEW YORK SITUATED AS SHE IS WOULD NEVER BE UNWISE ENOUGH TO OPPOSE A FEEBLE AND UNSUPPORTED FLANK TO THE WEIGHT OF THAT CONFEDERACY THERE ARE OTHER OBVIOUS REASONS
846-130986-0014 THAT WOULD FACILITATE HER ACCESSION TO IT NEW JERSEY IS TOO SMALL A STATE TO THINK OF BEING A FRONTIER IN OPPOSITION TO THIS STILL MORE POWERFUL COMBINATION NOR DO THERE APPEAR
846-130986-0015 EVEN PENNSYLVANIA WOULD HAVE STRONG INDUCEMENTS TO JOIN THE NORTHERN LEAGUE AN ACTIVE FOREIGN COMMERCE ON THE BASIS OF HER OWN NAVIGATION IS HER TRUE POLICY
846-130986-0016 AND COINCIDES WITH THE OPINIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF HER CITIZENS THE MORE SOUTHERN STATES FROM VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES MAY NOT THINK THEMSELVES MUCH INTERESTED IN THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF NAVIGATION THEY MAY PREFER A SYSTEM
846-130986-0017 WHICH WOULD GIVE UNLIMITED SCOPE TO ALL NATIONS TO BE THE CARRIERS AS WELL AS THE PURCHASERS OF THEIR COMMODITIES PENNSYLVANIA MAY NOT CHOOSE TO CONFOUND HER INTERESTS IN A CONNECTION SO ADVERSE TO HER POLICY
846-130986-0018 AS SHE MUST AT ALL EVENTS BE A FRONTIER SHE MAY DEEM IT MOST CONSISTENT WITH HER SAFETY TO HAVE HER EXPOSED SIDE TURNED TOWARDS THE WEAKER POWER OF THE SOUTHERN RATHER
846-130986-0019 THAN TOWARDS THE STRONGER POWER OF THE NORTHERN CONFEDERACY THIS WOULD GIVE HER THE FAIREST CHANCE TO AVOID BEING THE FLANDERS OF AMERICA
846-130986-0020 IF THE NORTHERN CONFEDERACY INCLUDES NEW JERSEY THERE IS NO LIKELIHOOD OF MORE THAN ONE CONFEDERACY TO THE SOUTH OF THAT STATE NOTHING CAN BE MORE EVIDENT THAN THAT
846-130986-0021 THE THIRTEEN STATES WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT BETTER THAN ONE HALF OR ONE THIRD OR ANY NUMBER LESS THAN THE WHOLE THIS REFLECTION MUST HAVE GREAT WEIGHT IN OBVIATING
846-130986-0022 WE TAKE INTO VIEW THE NUMBER OF PERSONS WHO MUST NECESSARILY BE EMPLOYED TO GUARD THE INLAND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT CONFEDERACIES AGAINST ILLICIT TRADE AND WHO IN TIME WILL INFALLIBLY SPRING UP OUT OF THE NECESSITIES OF REVENUE AND IF
846-130986-0023 WE ALSO TAKE INTO VIEW THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENTS WHICH IT HAS BEEN SHOWN WOULD UNAVOIDABLY RESULT FROM THE JEALOUSIES AND CONFLICTS OF THE SEVERAL NATIONS INTO WHICH THE STATES WOULD BE DIVIDED WE SHALL CLEARLY DISCOVER
846-130986-0024 THAT A SEPARATION WOULD BE NOT LESS INJURIOUS TO THE ECONOMY THAN TO THE TRANQUILLITY COMMERCE REVENUE AND LIBERTY OF EVERY
