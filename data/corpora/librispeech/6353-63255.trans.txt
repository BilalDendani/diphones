6353-63255-0000 WAS A LITTLE OUT OF THIS COMBINATION BUT HE WAS NOT A PERSON TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO DROOP HE CAME AND SEATED HIMSELF BY MISS CHANCELLOR AND BROACHED A LITERARY SUBJECT HE ASKED HER
6353-63255-0001 IF SHE WERE FOLLOWING ANY OF THE CURRENT SERIALS IN THE MAGAZINES ON HER TELLING HIM THAT SHE NEVER FOLLOWED ANYTHING OF THAT SORT HE UNDERTOOK A DEFENCE OF THE SERIAL SYSTEM
6353-63255-0002 WHICH SHE PRESENTLY REMINDED HIM THAT SHE HAD NOT ATTACKED HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BY THIS RETORT BUT GLIDED GRACEFULLY OFF TO THE QUESTION OF MOUNT DESERT
6353-63255-0003 CONVERSATION ON SOME SUBJECT OR OTHER BEING EVIDENTLY A NECESSITY OF HIS NATURE HE TALKED VERY QUICKLY AND SOFTLY
6353-63255-0004 THERE WAS A CERTAIN AMIABLE FLATNESS IN HIS TONE AND HE ABOUNDED IN EXCLAMATIONS GOODNESS GRACIOUS AND MERCY ON US NOT MUCH IN USE AMONG THE SEX WHOSE PROFANITY IS APT TO BE COARSE
6353-63255-0005 HE HAD SMALL FAIR FEATURES REMARKABLY NEAT AND PRETTY EYES AND A MOUSTACHE THAT HE CARESSED AND AN AIR OF JUVENILITY MUCH AT VARIANCE WITH HIS GRIZZLED LOCKS
6353-63255-0006 AND THE FREE FAMILIAR REFERENCE IN WHICH HE WAS APT TO INDULGE TO HIS CAREER AS A JOURNALIST HIS FRIENDS KNEW THAT IN SPITE OF HIS DELICACY AND HIS PRATTLE HE WAS WHAT THEY CALLED A LIVE MAN
6353-63255-0007 HIS APPEARANCE WAS PERFECTLY RECONCILABLE WITH A LARGE DEGREE OF LITERARY ENTERPRISE IT SHOULD BE EXPLAINED THAT FOR THE MOST PART THEY ATTACHED TO THIS IDEA THE SAME MEANING AS SELAH TARRANT
6353-63255-0008 A STATE OF INTIMACY WITH THE NEWSPAPERS THE CULTIVATION OF THE GREAT ARTS OF PUBLICITY FOR THIS INGENUOUS SON OF HIS AGE ALL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE PERSON AND THE ARTIST HAD CEASED TO EXIST THE WRITER WAS PERSONAL
6353-63255-0009 THE PERSON FOOD FOR NEWSBOYS AND EVERYTHING AND EVERY ONE WERE EVERY ONE'S BUSINESS ALL THINGS WITH HIM REFERRED THEMSELVES TO PRINT AND PRINT MEANT SIMPLY INFINITE REPORTING
6353-63255-0010 A PROMPTITUDE OF ANNOUNCEMENT ABUSIVE WHEN NECESSARY OR EVEN WHEN NOT ABOUT HIS FELLOW CITIZENS HE POURED CONTUMELY ON THEIR PRIVATE LIFE ON THEIR PERSONAL APPEARANCE WITH THE BEST CONSCIENCE IN THE WORLD
6353-63255-0011 HIS FAITH AGAIN WAS THE FAITH OF SELAH TARRANT THAT BEING IN THE NEWSPAPERS IS A CONDITION OF BLISS AND THAT IT WOULD BE FASTIDIOUS TO QUESTION THE TERMS OF THE PRIVILEGE
6353-63255-0012 HE WAS AN ENFANT DE LA BALLE AS THE FRENCH SAY HE HAD BEGUN HIS CAREER AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN BY GOING THE ROUNDS OF THE HOTELS TO CULL FLOWERS FROM THE BIG GREASY REGISTERS WHICH LIE ON THE MARBLE COUNTERS
6353-63255-0013 AND HE MIGHT FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE HAD CONTRIBUTED IN HIS MEASURE AND ON BEHALF OF A VIGILANT PUBLIC OPINION THE PRIDE OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE TO THE GREAT END
6353-63255-0014 HE WAS THE MOST BRILLIANT YOUNG INTERVIEWER ON THE BOSTON PRESS HE WAS
6353-63255-0015 HE HAD CONDENSED INTO SHORTHAND MANY OF THE MOST CELEBRATED WOMEN OF HIS TIME SOME OF THESE DAUGHTERS OF FAME WERE VERY VOLUMINOUS AND HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A REMARKABLY INSINUATING WAY
6353-63255-0016 THE MORNING AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL OR SOMETIMES THE VERY EVENING WHILE THEIR LUGGAGE WAS BEING BROUGHT UP
6353-63255-0017 AND WITH HIS HOARY HEAD WAS A THOROUGHLY MODERN YOUNG MAN HE HAD NO IDEA OF NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE MODERN CONVENIENCES HE REGARDED THE MISSION OF MANKIND UPON EARTH
6353-63255-0018 BUT THE NEWEST THING WAS WHAT CAME NEAREST EXCITING IN HIS MIND THE SENTIMENT OF RESPECT HE WAS AN OBJECT OF EXTREME ADMIRATION TO SELAH TARRANT WHO BELIEVED THAT HE HAD MASTERED ALL THE SECRETS OF SUCCESS
6353-63255-0019 AND WHO WHEN MISSUS TARRANT REMARKED AS SHE HAD DONE MORE THAN ONCE THAT IT LOOKED AS IF MISTER PARDON WAS REALLY COMING AFTER VERENA DECLARED THAT IF HE WAS HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW YOUNG MEN
6353-63255-0020 HE SHOULD WANT TO SEE IN THAT CONNEXION ONE OF THE FEW HE SHOULD BE WILLING TO ALLOW TO HANDLE HER IT WAS TARRANT'S CONVICTION THAT IF MATTHIAS PARDON SHOULD SEEK VERENA IN MARRIAGE
6353-63255-0021 WHO WAS AT THE SAME TIME REPORTER INTERVIEWER MANAGER AGENT WHO HAD THE COMMAND OF THE PRINCIPAL DAILIES WOULD WRITE HER UP AND WORK HER AS IT WERE SCIENTIFICALLY
6353-63255-0022 THE ATTRACTION OF ALL THIS WAS TOO OBVIOUS TO BE INSISTED ON MATTHIAS HAD A MEAN OPINION OF TARRANT THOUGHT HIM QUITE SECOND RATE A VOTARY OF PLAYED OUT CAUSES
6353-63255-0023 IT WAS HIS IMPRESSION THAT HE HIMSELF WAS IN LOVE WITH VERENA BUT HIS PASSION WAS NOT A JEALOUS ONE AND INCLUDED A REMARKABLE DISPOSITION TO SHARE THE OBJECT OF HIS AFFECTION WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
6353-63255-0024 HE TALKED SOME TIME TO OLIVE ABOUT MOUNT DESERT TOLD HER THAT IN HIS LETTERS HE HAD DESCRIBED THE COMPANY AT THE DIFFERENT HOTELS HE REMARKED HOWEVER
6353-63255-0025 THAT A CORRESPONDENT SUFFERED A GOOD DEAL TO DAY FROM THE COMPETITION OF THE LADY WRITERS THE SORT OF ARTICLE THEY PRODUCED WAS SOMETIMES MORE ACCEPTABLE TO THE PAPERS
6353-63255-0026 HE SUPPOSED SHE WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR THAT HE KNEW SHE WAS SO INTERESTED IN WOMAN'S HAVING A FREE FIELD THEY CERTAINLY MADE LOVELY CORRESPONDENTS
6353-63255-0027 THEY PICKED UP SOMETHING BRIGHT BEFORE YOU COULD TURN ROUND THERE WASN'T MUCH YOU COULD KEEP AWAY FROM THEM YOU HAD TO BE LIVELY IF YOU WANTED TO GET THERE FIRST OF COURSE THEY WERE NATURALLY MORE CHATTY AND THAT WAS THE STYLE OF LITERATURE
6353-63255-0028 THAT SEEMED TO TAKE MOST TO DAY ONLY THEY DIDN'T WRITE MUCH BUT WHAT LADIES WOULD WANT TO READ OF COURSE HE KNEW THERE WERE MILLIONS OF LADY READERS BUT HE INTIMATED THAT HE DIDN'T ADDRESS HIMSELF EXCLUSIVELY TO THE GYNECAEUM
6353-63255-0029 HE TRIED TO PUT IN SOMETHING THAT WOULD INTEREST ALL PARTIES IF YOU READ A LADY'S LETTER YOU KNEW PRETTY WELL IN ADVANCE WHAT YOU WOULD FIND NOW WHAT HE TRIED FOR WAS THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE THE LEAST IDEA
6353-63255-0030 HE ALWAYS TRIED TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE YOU JUMP MISTER PARDON WAS NOT CONCEITED MORE AT LEAST THAN IS PROPER WHEN YOUTH AND SUCCESS GO HAND IN HAND
6353-63255-0031 AND IT WAS NATURAL HE SHOULD NOT KNOW IN WHAT SPIRIT MISS CHANCELLOR LISTENED TO HIM BEING AWARE THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN OF CULTURE HIS DESIRE WAS SIMPLY TO SUPPLY HER WITH THE PABULUM THAT SHE WOULD EXPECT
6353-63255-0032 SHE THOUGHT HIM VERY INFERIOR SHE HAD HEARD HE WAS INTENSELY BRIGHT BUT THERE WAS PROBABLY SOME MISTAKE THERE COULDN'T BE ANY DANGER FOR VERENA FROM A MIND THAT TOOK MERELY A GOSSIP'S VIEW OF GREAT TENDENCIES
6353-63255-0033 BESIDES HE WASN'T HALF EDUCATED AND IT WAS HER BELIEF OR AT LEAST HER HOPE THAT AN EDUCATIVE PROCESS WAS NOW GOING ON FOR VERENA UNDER HER OWN DIRECTION
6353-63255-0034 WHICH WOULD ENABLE HER TO MAKE SUCH A DISCOVERY FOR HERSELF OLIVE HAD A STANDING QUARREL WITH THE LEVITY THE GOOD NATURE OF THE JUDGEMENTS OF THE DAY MANY OF THEM SEEMED TO HER WEAK TO IMBECILITY
6353-63255-0035 LOSING SIGHT OF ALL MEASURES AND STANDARDS LAVISHING SUPERLATIVES DELIGHTED TO BE FOOLED THE AGE SEEMED TO HER RELAXED AND DEMORALISED
6353-63255-0036 AND I BELIEVE SHE LOOKED TO THE INFLUX OF THE GREAT FEMININE ELEMENT TO MAKE IT FEEL AND SPEAK MORE SHARPLY WELL IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO HEAR YOU TWO TALK TOGETHER MISSUS TARRANT SAID TO HER
6353-63255-0037 IT'S WHAT I CALL REAL CONVERSATION IT ISN'T OFTEN WE HAVE ANYTHING SO FRESH IT MAKES ME FEEL AS IF I WANTED TO JOIN IN I SCARCELY KNOW WHOM TO LISTEN TO MOST VERENA
6353-63255-0038 SEEMS TO BE HAVING SUCH A TIME WITH THOSE GENTLEMEN FIRST I CATCH ONE THING AND THEN ANOTHER IT SEEMS AS IF I COULDN'T TAKE IT ALL IN PERHAPS I OUGHT TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO MISTER BURRAGE I DON'T WANT HIM TO THINK
6353-63255-0039 WE ARE NOT SO CORDIAL AS THEY ARE IN NEW YORK SHE DECIDED TO DRAW NEARER TO THE TRIO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM FOR SHE HAD PERCEIVED AS SHE DEVOUTLY HOPED MISS CHANCELLOR HAD NOT
6353-63255-0040 AND THAT THESE UNSCRUPULOUS YOUNG MEN AFTER A GLANCE OVER THEIR SHOULDER APPEARED TO PLEAD FOR REMISSION TO INTIMATE THAT THIS WAS NOT WHAT THEY HAD COME ROUND FOR
6353-63255-0041 SELAH WANDERED OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN WITH HIS COLLECTION OF CAKES AND MISTER PARDON BEGAN TO TALK TO OLIVE ABOUT VERENA TO SAY THAT HE FELT AS IF HE COULDN'T SAY ALL HE DID FEEL WITH REGARD TO THE INTEREST SHE HAD SHOWN IN HER
6353-63255-0042 OLIVE COULD NOT IMAGINE WHY HE WAS CALLED UPON TO SAY OR TO FEEL ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE HIM SHORT ANSWERS WHILE THE POOR YOUNG MAN UNCONSCIOUS OF HIS DOOM REMARKED THAT HE HOPED SHE WASN'T GOING TO EXERCISE ANY INFLUENCE
6353-63255-0043 THAT WOULD PREVENT MISS TARRANT FROM TAKING THE RANK THAT BELONGED TO HER HE THOUGHT THERE WAS TOO MUCH HANGING BACK HE WANTED TO SEE HER IN A FRONT SEAT HE WANTED TO SEE HER NAME IN THE BIGGEST KIND OF BILLS
6353-63255-0044 HE DIDN'T SEE WHAT THEY WERE WAITING FOR HE DIDN'T SUPPOSE THEY WERE WAITING TILL SHE WAS FIFTY YEARS OLD THERE WERE OLD ONES ENOUGH IN THE FIELD HE KNEW THAT MISS CHANCELLOR APPRECIATED THE ADVANTAGE OF HER GIRLHOOD
6353-63255-0045 BECAUSE MISS VERENA HAD TOLD HIM SO HER FATHER WAS DREADFULLY SLACK AND THE WINTER WAS EBBING AWAY MISTER PARDON WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT IF DOCTOR TARRANT DIDN'T SEE HIS WAY TO DO SOMETHING
6353-63255-0046 HE SHOULD FEEL AS IF HE SHOULD WANT TO TAKE HOLD HIMSELF HE EXPRESSED A HOPE AT THE SAME TIME THAT OLIVE HAD NOT ANY VIEWS THAT WOULD LEAD HER TO BRING HER INFLUENCE TO BEAR TO MAKE MISS VERENA HOLD BACK
6353-63255-0047 ALSO THAT SHE WOULDN'T CONSIDER THAT HE PRESSED IN TOO MUCH HE KNEW THAT WAS A CHARGE THAT PEOPLE BROUGHT AGAINST NEWSPAPER MEN THAT THEY WERE RATHER APT TO CROSS THE LINE HE ONLY WORRIED
6353-63255-0048 BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THOSE WHO WERE NO DOUBT NEARER TO MISS VERENA THAN HE COULD HOPE TO BE WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY ALIVE HE KNEW THAT SHE HAD APPEARED IN TWO OR THREE PARLOURS SINCE THAT EVENING AT MISS BIRDSEYE'S
6353-63255-0049 AND HE HAD HEARD OF THE DELIGHTFUL OCCASION AT MISS CHANCELLOR'S OWN HOUSE WHERE SO MANY OF THE FIRST FAMILIES HAD BEEN INVITED TO MEET HER THIS WAS AN ALLUSION TO A SMALL LUNCHEON PARTY THAT OLIVE HAD GIVEN
6353-63255-0050 WHEN VERENA DISCOURSED TO A DOZEN MATRONS AND SPINSTERS SELECTED BY HER HOSTESS WITH INFINITE CONSIDERATION AND MANY SPIRITUAL SCRUPLES A REPORT OF THE AFFAIR
6353-63255-0051 PRESUMABLY FROM THE HAND OF THE YOUNG MATTHIAS WHO NATURALLY HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT APPEARED WITH EXTRAORDINARY PROMPTNESS IN AN EVENING PAPER THAT WAS VERY WELL SO FAR AS IT WENT
6353-63255-0052 BUT HE WANTED SOMETHING ON ANOTHER SCALE SOMETHING SO BIG THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO GO ROUND IF THEY WANTED TO GET PAST THEN LOWERING HIS VOICE A LITTLE HE MENTIONED WHAT IT WAS A LECTURE
6353-63255-0053 IN THE MUSIC HALL AT FIFTY CENTS A TICKET WITHOUT HER FATHER RIGHT THERE ON HER OWN BASIS HE LOWERED HIS VOICE STILL MORE AND REVEALED TO MISS CHANCELLOR HIS INNERMOST THOUGHT
6353-63255-0054 HAVING FIRST ASSURED HIMSELF THAT SELAH WAS STILL ABSENT AND THAT MISSUS TARRANT WAS INQUIRING OF MISTER BURRAGE
6353-63255-0055 MISS VERENA WANTED TO SHED HER FATHER ALTOGETHER SHE DIDN'T WANT HIM PAWING ROUND HER THAT WAY BEFORE SHE BEGAN IT DIDN'T ADD IN THE LEAST TO THE ATTRACTION MISTER PARDON EXPRESSED THE CONVICTION
6353-63255-0056 THAT MISS CHANCELLOR AGREED WITH HIM IN THIS AND IT REQUIRED A GREAT EFFORT OF MIND ON OLIVE'S PART SO SMALL WAS HER DESIRE TO ACT IN CONCERT WITH MISTER PARDON TO ADMIT TO HERSELF THAT SHE DID
6353-63255-0057 SHE ASKED HIM WITH A CERTAIN LOFTY COLDNESS HE DIDN'T MAKE HER SHY NOW A BIT WHETHER HE TOOK A GREAT INTEREST IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE POSITION OF WOMEN THE QUESTION APPEARED TO STRIKE THE YOUNG MAN AS ABRUPT AND IRRELEVANT
6353-63255-0058 TO COME DOWN ON HIM FROM A HEIGHT WITH WHICH HE WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO HOLD INTERCOURSE HE WAS USED TO QUICK OPERATIONS HOWEVER AND HE HAD ONLY A MOMENT OF BRIGHT BLANKNESS BEFORE REPLYING
6353-63255-0059 OLIVE WAS SILENT A MOMENT WHAT I MEAN IS IS YOUR SYMPATHY A SYMPATHY WITH OUR SEX OR A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN MISS TARRANT
6353-63255-0060 IT TAKES IN MISS VERENA AND IT TAKES IN ALL OTHERS EXCEPT THE LADY CORRESPONDENTS
6353-63255-0061 AS HE PERCEIVED EVEN AT THE MOMENT WAS LOST ON VERENA'S FRIEND HE WAS NOT MORE SUCCESSFUL WHEN HE WENT ON IT TAKES IN EVEN YOU MISS CHANCELLOR OLIVE ROSE TO HER FEET HESITATING
6353-63255-0062 SHE WANTED TO GO AWAY AND YET SHE COULDN'T BEAR TO LEAVE VERENA TO BE EXPLOITED AS SHE FELT THAT SHE WOULD BE AFTER HER DEPARTURE THAT INDEED SHE HAD ALREADY BEEN
6353-63255-0063 BY THOSE OFFENSIVE YOUNG MEN SHE HAD A STRANGE SENSE TOO THAT HER FRIEND HAD NEGLECTED HER FOR THE LAST HALF HOUR HAD NOT BEEN OCCUPIED WITH HER HAD PLACED A BARRIER BETWEEN THEM
6353-63255-0064 A BARRIER OF BROAD MALE BACKS OF LAUGHTER THAT VERGED UPON COARSENESS OF GLANCING SMILES DIRECTED ACROSS THE ROOM DIRECTED TO OLIVE WHICH SEEMED RATHER TO DISCONNECT HER WITH WHAT WAS GOING FORWARD
6353-63255-0065 ON THAT SIDE THAN TO INVITE HER TO TAKE PART IN IT IF VERENA RECOGNISED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR WAS NOT IN REPORT AS HER FATHER SAID WHEN JOCOSE YOUNG MEN RULED THE SCENE
6353-63255-0066 THE DISCOVERY IMPLIED NO GREAT PENETRATION BUT THE POOR GIRL MIGHT HAVE REFLECTED FURTHER THAT TO SEE IT TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT SHE WAS UNADAPTED FOR SUCH COMPANY
6353-63255-0067 COULD SCARCELY BE MORE AGREEABLE TO OLIVE THAN TO BE DRAGGED INTO IT THIS YOUNG LADY'S WORST APPREHENSIONS WERE NOW JUSTIFIED BY MISSUS TARRANT'S CRYING TO HER THAT SHE MUST NOT GO
6353-63255-0068 AS MISTER BURRAGE AND MISTER GRACIE WERE TRYING TO PERSUADE VERENA TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE SPECIMEN OF INSPIRATIONAL SPEAKING AND SHE WAS SURE HER DAUGHTER WOULD COMPLY IN A MOMENT
6353-63255-0069 IF MISS CHANCELLOR WOULD JUST TELL HER TO COMPOSE HERSELF THEY HAD GOT TO OWN UP TO IT MISS CHANCELLOR COULD DO MORE WITH HER THAN ANY ONE ELSE
6353-63255-0070 BUT MISTER GRACIE AND MISTER BURRAGE HAD EXCITED HER SO THAT SHE WAS AFRAID IT WOULD BE RATHER AN UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORT THE WHOLE GROUP HAD GOT UP AND VERENA CAME TO OLIVE WITH HER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED
6353-63255-0071 AND NO SIGNS OF A BAD CONSCIENCE IN HER BRIGHT FACE I KNOW YOU LIKE ME TO SPEAK SO MUCH I'LL TRY TO SAY SOMETHING IF YOU WANT ME TO
6353-63255-0072 I WISH WE HAD BROUGHT SOME OF OUR FRIENDS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED TO COME IF WE HAD GIVEN THEM A CHANCE SAID MISTER BURRAGE THERE IS AN IMMENSE DESIRE THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSITY TO HEAR YOU
6353-63255-0073 AND THERE IS NO SUCH SYMPATHETIC AUDIENCE
6353-63255-0074 AND I AM SURE HE WILL SAY AS MUCH OF ME THE YOUNG MAN SPOKE THESE WORDS FREELY AND LIGHTLY SMILING AT VERENA AND EVEN A LITTLE AT OLIVE WITH THE AIR OF ONE TO WHOM
6353-63255-0075 A MASTERY OF CLEVER CHAFF WAS COMMONLY ATTRIBUTED MISTER BURRAGE LISTENS EVEN BETTER THAN HE TALKS HIS COMPANION DECLARED WE HAVE THE HABIT OF ATTENTION AT LECTURES YOU KNOW
6353-63255-0076 TO BE LECTURED BY YOU WOULD BE AN ADVANTAGE INDEED WE ARE SUNK IN IGNORANCE AND PREJUDICE
6353-63255-0077 IF YOU COULD SEE THEM I ASSURE YOU THEY ARE SOMETHING MONSTROUS GIVE THEM A REGULAR DUCKING AND MAKE THEM GASP MATTHIAS PARDON CRIED
6353-63255-0078 THESE GENTLEMEN WILL CARRY THE NEWS IT WILL BE THE NARROW END OF THE WEDGE I CAN'T TELL WHAT YOU LIKE VERENA SAID STILL LOOKING INTO OLIVE'S EYES
6353-63255-0079 SELAH HAD REAPPEARED BY THIS TIME HIS LOFTY CONTEMPLATIVE PERSON WAS FRAMED BY THE DOORWAY WANT TO TRY A LITTLE INSPIRATION HE INQUIRED LOOKING ROUND ON THE CIRCLE WITH AN ENCOURAGING INFLEXION
6353-63255-0080 I'LL DO IT ALONE IF YOU PREFER VERENA SAID SOOTHINGLY TO HER FRIEND IT MIGHT BE A GOOD CHANCE TO TRY WITHOUT FATHER YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU AIN'T GOING TO BE SUPPORTED MISSUS TARRANT EXCLAIMED WITH DISMAY
6353-63255-0081 DEFENDING HIS INTEGRITY I WILL DROP RIGHT
6353-63255-0082 I HAVE NO DESIRE TO DRAW ATTENTION TO MY OWN POOR GIFTS THIS DECLARATION APPEARED TO BE ADDRESSED TO MISS CHANCELLOR WELL THERE WILL BE MORE INSPIRATION IF YOU DON'T TOUCH HER MATTHIAS PARDON SAID TO HIM
6353-63255-0083 IT WILL SEEM TO COME RIGHT DOWN FROM WELL WHEREVER IT DOES COME FROM YES WE DON'T PRETEND TO SAY THAT MISSUS TARRANT MURMURED THIS LITTLE DISCUSSION
6353-63255-0084 HAD BROUGHT THE BLOOD TO OLIVE'S FACE SHE FELT THAT EVERY ONE PRESENT WAS LOOKING AT HER VERENA MOST OF ALL AND THAT HERE WAS A CHANCE TO TAKE A MORE COMPLETE POSSESSION OF THE GIRL SUCH CHANCES WERE AGITATING
6353-63255-0085 MOREOVER SHE DIDN'T LIKE ON ANY OCCASION TO BE SO PROMINENT BUT EVERYTHING THAT HAD BEEN SAID WAS BENIGHTED AND VULGAR
6353-63255-0086 THE PLACE SEEMED THICK WITH THE VERY ATMOSPHERE OUT OF WHICH SHE WISHED TO LIFT VERENA THEY WERE TREATING HER AS A SHOW AS A SOCIAL RESOURCE
6353-63255-0087 AND THE TWO YOUNG MEN FROM THE COLLEGE WERE LAUGHING AT HER SHAMELESSLY SHE WAS NOT MEANT FOR THAT AND OLIVE WOULD SAVE HER VERENA WAS SO SIMPLE SHE COULDN'T SEE HERSELF SHE WAS THE ONLY PURE SPIRIT IN THE ODIOUS GROUP
6353-63255-0088 I WANT YOU TO ADDRESS AUDIENCES THAT ARE WORTH ADDRESSING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE WHO ARE SERIOUS AND SINCERE OLIVE HERSELF AS SHE SPOKE HEARD THE GREAT SHAKE IN HER VOICE YOUR MISSION
6353-63255-0089 IS NOT TO EXHIBIT YOURSELF AS A PASTIME FOR INDIVIDUALS BUT TO TOUCH THE HEART OF COMMUNITIES OF NATIONS DEAR MADAM I'M SURE MISS TARRANT WILL TOUCH MY HEART
6353-63255-0090 MISTER BURRAGE OBJECTED GALLANTLY WELL I DON'T KNOW BUT SHE JUDGES YOU YOUNG MEN FAIRLY SAID MISSUS TARRANT WITH A SIGH VERENA DIVERTED A MOMENT FROM HER COMMUNION WITH HER FRIEND
6353-63255-0091 SAID OLIVE ALMOST INAUDIBLY
6353-63255-0092 I CAN SEE YOU DON'T WANT IT SAID VERENA WONDERING YOU WOULD STAY IF YOU LIKED IT WOULDN'T YOU I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO COME OUT WITH ME OLIVE SPOKE ALMOST WITH FIERCENESS
6353-63255-0093 CAME SAID MATTHIAS PARDON I GUESS YOU HAD BETTER COME ROUND SOME OTHER NIGHT SELAH SUGGESTED PACIFICALLY BUT WITH A SIGNIFICANCE WHICH FELL UPON OLIVE'S EAR
6353-63255-0094 DO YOU WANT TO SAVE HARVARD COLLEGE OR DO YOU NOT HE DEMANDED WITH A HUMOROUS FROWN I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HARVARD COLLEGE VERENA RETURNED AS HUMOROUSLY I AM AFRAID YOU ARE RATHER DISAPPOINTED IN YOUR EVENING
6353-63255-0095 IF YOU EXPECTED TO OBTAIN SOME INSIGHT INTO OUR IDEAS SAID MISSUS TARRANT WITH AN AIR OF IMPOTENT SYMPATHY TO MISTER GRACIE WELL GOOD NIGHT MISS CHANCELLOR SHE WENT ON
6353-63255-0096 IT SEEMS AS IF DOCTOR TARRANT COULDN'T REMEMBER TO GO FOR THE MAN TO FIX IT I AM AFRAID YOU'LL THINK WE'RE TOO MUCH TAKEN UP WITH ALL THESE NEW HOPES WELL WE HAVE ENJOYED SEEING YOU IN OUR HOME
6353-63255-0097 I CAN'T STAND A SLEIGH MYSELF IT MAKES ME SICK THIS WAS HER HOSTESS'S RESPONSE TO MISS CHANCELLOR'S VERY SUMMARY FAREWELL UTTERED AS THE THREE LADIES PROCEEDED TOGETHER TO THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE
6353-63255-0098 OLIVE HAD GOT HERSELF OUT OF THE LITTLE PARLOUR WITH A SORT OF BLIND DEFIANT DASH SHE HAD TAKEN NO PERCEPTIBLE LEAVE OF THE REST OF THE COMPANY WHEN SHE WAS CALM SHE HAD VERY GOOD MANNERS
6353-63255-0099 BUT WHEN SHE WAS AGITATED SHE WAS GUILTY OF LAPSES EVERY ONE OF WHICH CAME BACK TO HER MAGNIFIED IN THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT SOMETIMES THEY EXCITED REMORSE AND SOMETIMES TRIUMPH
6353-63255-0100 IN THE LATTER CASE SHE FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO JUSTLY VINDICTIVE IN COLD BLOOD TARRANT WISHED TO GUIDE HER DOWN THE STEPS OUT OF THE LITTLE YARD TO HER CARRIAGE
6353-63255-0101 HE REMINDED HER THAT THEY HAD HAD ASHES SPRINKLED ON THE PLANKS ON PURPOSE BUT SHE BEGGED HIM TO LET HER ALONE SHE ALMOST PUSHED HIM BACK SHE DREW VERENA OUT INTO THE DARK FRESHNESS
6353-63255-0102 THERE WAS A SPLENDID SKY ALL BLUE BLACK AND SILVER A SPARKLING WINTRY VAULT WHERE THE STARS WERE LIKE A MYRIAD POINTS OF ICE THE AIR WAS SILENT AND SHARP
6353-63255-0103 AND THE VAGUE SNOW LOOKED CRUEL OLIVE KNEW NOW VERY DEFINITELY WHAT THE PROMISE WAS THAT SHE WANTED VERENA TO MAKE BUT IT WAS TOO COLD SHE COULD KEEP HER THERE BAREHEADED BUT AN INSTANT
6353-63255-0104 MISSUS TARRANT MEANWHILE IN THE PARLOUR REMARKED THAT IT SEEMED AS IF
6353-63255-0105 MISTER BURRAGE AND MISTER GRACIE SAID THEY WOULD INVITE HER ON THE SPOT IN THE NAME OF THE UNIVERSITY AND MATTHIAS PARDON REFLECTED AND ASSERTED WITH GLEE THAT THIS WOULD BE THE NEWEST THING YET
6353-63255-0106 BUT HE ADDED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A HIGH TIME WITH MISS CHANCELLOR FIRST AND THIS WAS EVIDENTLY THE CONVICTION OF THE COMPANY I CAN SEE YOU ARE ANGRY AT SOMETHING VERENA SAID TO OLIVE
6353-63255-0107 AS THE TWO STOOD THERE IN THE STARLIGHT I HOPE IT ISN'T ME WHAT HAVE I DONE I AM NOT ANGRY I AM ANXIOUS I AM SO AFRAID I SHALL LOSE YOU VERENA
6353-63255-0108 DON'T FAIL ME DON'T FAIL ME OLIVE SPOKE LOW WITH A KIND OF PASSION FAIL YOU HOW CAN I FAIL YOU CAN'T OF COURSE YOU CAN'T
6353-63255-0109 YOUR STAR IS ABOVE YOU BUT DON'T LISTEN TO THEM TO WHOM DO YOU MEAN OLIVE TO MY PARENTS OH NO NOT YOUR PARENTS MISS CHANCELLOR REPLIED WITH SOME SHARPNESS
6353-63255-0110 SHE PAUSED A MOMENT AND THEN SHE SAID I DON'T CARE FOR YOUR PARENTS I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE BUT NOW THAT I HAVE SEEN THEM
6353-63255-0111 I DON'T CARE FOR THEM I MUST REPEAT IT VERENA I SHOULD BE DISHONEST IF I LET YOU THINK I DID WHY OLIVE CHANCELLOR VERENA MURMURED
6353-63255-0112 AS IF SHE WERE TRYING IN SPITE OF THE SADNESS PRODUCED BY THIS DECLARATION TO DO JUSTICE TO HER FRIEND'S IMPARTIALITY YES I AM HARD PERHAPS I AM CRUEL
6353-63255-0113 BUT WE MUST BE HARD IF WE WISH TO TRIUMPH DON'T LISTEN TO YOUNG MEN WHEN THEY TRY TO MOCK AND MUDDLE YOU THEY DON'T CARE FOR YOU THEY DON'T CARE FOR US THEY CARE ONLY FOR THEIR PLEASURE
6353-63255-0114 VERENA SAID WITH A SMILE THAT LOOKED DIM IN THE DARKNESS
6353-63255-0115 DO YOU MEAN TO GIVE YOU UP NO ALL OUR WRETCHED SISTERS ALL OUR HOPES AND PURPOSES ALL THAT WE THINK SACRED AND WORTH LIVING FOR
6353-63255-0116 OH THEY DON'T WANT THAT OLIVE VERENA'S SMILE BECAME MORE DISTINCT
6353-63255-0117 AND DANCE FOR THEM OLIVE YOU ARE CRUEL YES I AM BUT PROMISE ME ONE THING AND I SHALL BE OH SO TENDER
6353-63255-0118 WHAT A STRANGE PLACE FOR PROMISES SAID VERENA WITH A SHIVER LOOKING ABOUT HER INTO THE NIGHT YES I AM DREADFUL I KNOW IT BUT PROMISE
6353-63255-0119 AND OLIVE DREW THE GIRL NEARER TO HER FLINGING OVER HER WITH ONE HAND THE FOLD OF A CLOAK THAT HUNG AMPLE UPON HER OWN MEAGRE PERSON AND HOLDING HER THERE WITH THE OTHER WHILE SHE LOOKED AT HER
6353-63255-0120 SUPPLIANT BUT HALF HESITATING PROMISE SHE REPEATED IS IT SOMETHING TERRIBLE NEVER TO LISTEN TO ONE OF THEM NEVER TO BE BRIBED AT THIS MOMENT THE HOUSE DOOR WAS OPENED AGAIN
6353-63255-0121 MATTHIAS PARDON STOOD IN THE APERTURE AND TARRANT AND HIS WIFE WITH THE TWO OTHER VISITORS APPEARED TO HAVE COME FORWARD AS WELL TO SEE WHAT DETAINED VERENA
6353-63255-0122 MISTER PARDON SAID YOU LADIES HAD BETTER LOOK OUT OR YOU'LL FREEZE TOGETHER VERENA WAS REMINDED BY HER MOTHER THAT SHE WOULD CATCH HER DEATH BUT SHE HAD ALREADY HEARD SHARPLY
6353-63255-0123 LOW AS THEY WERE SPOKEN FIVE LAST WORDS FROM OLIVE WHO NOW ABRUPTLY RELEASED HER AND PASSED SWIFTLY OVER THE PATH FROM THE PORCH TO HER WAITING CARRIAGE TARRANT CREAKED ALONG
6353-63255-0124 IN PURSUIT TO ASSIST MISS CHANCELLOR THE OTHERS DREW VERENA INTO THE HOUSE PROMISE ME NOT TO MARRY THAT WAS WHAT ECHOED IN HER STARTLED MIND
6353-63255-0125 AND REPEATED ITSELF THERE WHEN MISTER BURRAGE RETURNED TO THE CHARGE ASKING HER IF SHE WOULDN'T AT LEAST APPOINT SOME EVENING WHEN THEY MIGHT LISTEN TO HER
6353-63255-0126 SHE HAD ALREADY FELT IT IN THE AIR SHE WOULD HAVE SAID AT ANY TIME IF SHE HAD BEEN ASKED THAT SHE DIDN'T SUPPOSE MISS CHANCELLOR WOULD WANT HER TO MARRY BUT THE IDEA UTTERED AS HER FRIEND HAD UTTERED IT
6353-63255-0127 HAD A NEW SOLEMNITY AND THE EFFECT OF THAT QUICK VIOLENT COLLOQUY WAS TO MAKE HER NERVOUS AND IMPATIENT AS IF SHE HAD HAD A SUDDEN GLIMPSE OF FUTURITY THAT WAS RATHER AWFUL
6353-63255-0128 EVEN IF IT REPRESENTED THE FATE ONE WOULD LIKE WHEN THE TWO YOUNG MEN FROM THE COLLEGE PRESSED THEIR PETITION SHE ASKED WITH A LAUGH THAT SURPRISED THEM WHETHER THEY WISHED TO MOCK AND MUDDLE HER
6353-63255-0129 THEY WENT AWAY ASSENTING TO MISSUS TARRANT'S LAST REMARK I AM AFRAID YOU'LL FEEL THAT YOU DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND US YET MATTHIAS PARDON REMAINED HER FATHER AND MOTHER EXPRESSING THEIR PERFECT CONFIDENCE
6353-63255-0130 THAT HE WOULD EXCUSE THEM WENT TO BED AND LEFT HIM SITTING THERE HE STAYED A GOOD WHILE LONGER NEARLY AN HOUR AND SAID THINGS THAT MADE VERENA THINK THAT HE PERHAPS WOULD LIKE TO MARRY HER
6353-63255-0131 BUT WHILE SHE LISTENED TO HIM MORE ABSTRACTEDLY THAN HER CUSTOM WAS SHE REMARKED TO HERSELF THAT THERE COULD BE NO DIFFICULTY IN PROMISING OLIVE SO FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED
6353-63255-0132 HE WAS VERY PLEASANT AND HE KNEW AN IMMENSE DEAL ABOUT EVERYTHING OR RATHER ABOUT EVERY ONE AND HE WOULD TAKE HER RIGHT INTO THE MIDST OF LIFE BUT SHE DIDN'T WISH TO MARRY HIM ALL THE SAME
6353-63255-0133 AND AFTER HE HAD GONE SHE REFLECTED THAT ONCE SHE CAME TO THINK OF IT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO MARRY ANY ONE SO IT WOULD BE EASY AFTER ALL TO MAKE OLIVE THAT PROMISE
