1335-163935-0000 VERY LITTLE ENTHUSIASM WAS FELT ON THE SUBJECT AND INDEED WHEN ONE THINKS OF THE TASTELESS GUMMY MESS WHICH IS SO OFTEN PUT BEFORE THE FAMILY THIS LACK OF ENTHUSIASM IS NOT STRANGE HOWEVER RICE PROPERLY PREPARED
1335-163935-0001 PROVES QUITE A FORMIDABLE RIVAL OF THE BELOVED POTATO AND THERE ARE ENDLESS WAYS OF PREPARING IT
1335-163935-0002 VERY FEW KNOW HOW TO COOK JUST PLAIN BOILED RICE MANY KNOW THAT THERE IS A WAY OF PREPARING IT SO THAT WHEN DONE IT WILL BE A FLUFFY MASS OF SEPARATE GRAINS BUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO GO ABOUT MAKING IT LOOK LIKE THIS
1335-163935-0003 THE PROCESS IS VERY SIMPLE ALWAYS USE THE UNPOLISHED RICE RICE WITH A CREAMY TINGE IS BETTER THAN RICE WITH A PEARLY WHITE TINGE AND THE LONG GRAIN IS BETTER THAN THE SHORT
1335-163935-0004 PLAIN BOILED RICE FOR EVERY CUP OF RICE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT CUPS OF WATER DO NOT ADD THE RICE UNTIL THE WATER IS BOILING BRISKLY
1335-163935-0005 THEN THROW IN THE RICE AND GIVE IT AN OCCASIONAL STIR UNTIL THE WATER BEGINS TO BOIL AGAIN AFTER THAT IT NEED NOT BE STIRRED COOK UNTIL A GRAIN FEELS SOFT WHEN RUBBED BETWEEN THE THUMB AND FINGER THEN TURN INTO A COLANDER
1335-163935-0006 DRAIN OFF THE WATER AND POUR OVER THE RICE SEVERAL CUPS OF COLD WATER DRAIN THAT OFF TOO AND PLACE THE RICE WHERE IT CAN HAVE MOIST HEAT FOR A WHILE BEFORE SERVING
1335-163935-0007 AND PLACE IT OVER A PAN OF BOILING WATER OR A STEAMER MAY BE USED FOR KEEPING IT WARM OR A DOUBLE BOILER BY THIS METHOD EVERY GRAIN IS SEPARATE RICE SERVED WITH CURRY IS ALWAYS PREPARED IN THIS WAY
1335-163935-0008 IT MAY BE SERVED IN PLACE OF POTATOES WITH MEAT AND MAY ALSO BE USED AS A BASIS FOR MANY INEXPENSIVE AND ATTRACTIVE DISHES JUST AS MACARONI AND SPAGHETTI ARE
1335-163935-0009 THERE IS ONE OBJECTION HOWEVER TO RICE PREPARED IN THIS WAY A GOOD DEAL OF THE NUTRITIVE VALUE IS LOST DOWN THE SINK DRAIN IN INDIA THIS IS NOT THE CASE FOR EVERY OUNCE OF RICE WATER IS THERE CAREFULLY SAVED
1335-163935-0010 IT IS USED IN VARIOUS WAYS USUALLY IT IS FED TO THE BABIES AND WEAKER CHILDREN OFTEN IT IS GIVEN TO DUCKS AND FOWL TO FATTEN THEM AND SOMETIMES IT IS PUT INTO THE CURRY POT
1335-163935-0011 THERE IS ANOTHER METHOD OF PREPARING RICE WHICH IS ALMOST AS SATISFACTORY AND BY WHICH ALL THE NUTRITION IS RETAINED THAT IS BY COOKING IT IN A REGULAR RICE BOILER PUT JUST ENOUGH WATER OVER THE RICE TO WELL COVER IT
1335-163935-0012 AFTER THE WATER IN THE LOWER VESSEL HAS BOILED A WHILE IF THE RICE SEEMS A LITTLE DRY ADD MORE WATER COOK UNTIL THE RICE IS SOFT THEN TURN THE FIRE VERY LOW SO THAT THE WATER IN THE LOWER VESSEL DOES NOT BOIL
1335-163935-0013 BABY'S PESH PASH THIS IS THE FIRST SOLID FOOD THAT BABIES OF ENGLISH OR AMERICAN PARENTS IN INDIA ARE ALLOWED TAKE ABOUT A QUARTER OF A POUND OF LEAN MUTTON
1335-163935-0014 SHRED IT FINELY AND RETURN TO THE BROTH COOK A TABLESPOONFUL OF RICE IN THIS BROTH AND SHREDDED MUTTON COOK SLOWLY AND LET EVERY GRAIN SWELL TO ITS UTMOST
1335-163935-0015 BABIES CRY FOR IT AND THE DOCTORS PRONOUNCE IT HARMLESS IT IS ALSO VERY GOOD FOR THE CONVALESCENT
1335-163935-0016 PULLAO PULLAO IS THE MOST FESTIVE DISH IN INDIA IT STANDS FOR ALL THAT ROAST TURKEY DOES IN THIS COUNTRY AT WEDDINGS FEASTS AND HOLIDAYS IT IS THE CHIEF DISH
1335-163935-0017 AMONG THE HINDUSTANI CHRISTIANS IT IS THE CHRISTMAS DINNER SOMETIMES IT IS SERVED WITH RIVERS OF HOT CURRY FLOWING OVER IT BUT OFTEN IT IS EATEN WITHOUT THE CURRY
1335-163935-0018 PUT A LITTLE BAG OF MIXED SPICES SUCH AS ARE USED IN MAKING PICKLES ON TO COOK WITH THE FOWL WHILE THE FOWL IS COOKING TAKE ABOUT A POUND OF RICE AND FRY IT WITH A FEW SLICED ONIONS AND A LITTLE BUTTER OR CRISCO
1335-163935-0019 WHEN THE CHICKEN IS NEARLY DONE ADD THE FRIED RICE AND ONIONS TO THE CHICKEN AND CHICKEN BROTH PUT ALL IN A RICE BOILER IF YOU HAVE IT AND COOK SLOWLY UNTIL THE RICE IS DONE RETAIN THE SPICES
1335-163935-0020 IF RICE BOILER IS USED THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST TWO INCHES OF BROTH ABOVE THE MIXTURE IF YOU HAVE NO RICE BOILER BUT MUST BOIL IT ON THE STOVE MORE BROTH WILL BE REQUIRED
1335-163935-0021 IN THE LATTER CASE DO NOT COOK UNTIL IT BECOMES SOGGY COOK UNTIL THE BROTH IS ABSORBED THEN STEAM WHILE THE RICE IS COOKING FRY A FEW MORE ONIONS WITH A HANDFUL OF ALMONDS AND RAISINS
1335-163935-0022 BEEF OR MUTTON PULLAO VERY DELICIOUS PULLAO MAY BE MADE FROM THE CHEAPEST CUTS OF BEEF AND MUTTON GET ABOUT TWO POUNDS OF BEEF OR MUTTON CUT IN BITS COOK UNTIL IT IS VERY TENDER
1335-163935-0023 BOIL WITH THIS A LITTLE BAG OF MIXED SPICES AND TWO ONIONS UNLESS THE MEAT HAS A GOOD DEAL OF FAT USE CRISCO OR OIL TWO CUPS OF RICE WILL BE THE RIGHT AMOUNT TO USE WITH TWO POUNDS OF MEAT
1335-163935-0024 USE THE SAME METHOD THAT IS USED IN MAKING CHICKEN PULLAO FRESH COCOANUT IS ALWAYS DELICIOUS STREWN OVER PULLAO AND IF CURRY IS USED WITH IT HAVE COCOANUT IN THE CURRY
1335-163935-0025 SPANISH RICE FRY THREE ONIONS SIX TOMATOES TWO PEPPERS OR PIMENTOS TOGETHER
1335-163935-0026 IN ANOTHER PAN FRY A CUP OF RICE IN A VERY LITTLE OIL OR CRISCO AFTER THE RICE HAS BROWNED A LITTLE ADD THE TWO TOGETHER TURN INTO A RICE BOILER OR STEAMER AND COOK UNTIL RICE IS TENDER
1335-163935-0027 IN THAT CASE FRY THE ONIONS AND PEPPERS AND RICE TOGETHER THEN ADD THE CHEESE AND TOMATOES
1335-163935-0028 PEA PULLAO TAKE TWO CUPS OF COLD BOILED RICE
1335-163935-0029 POUR OVER THE MIXTURE A HALF CUPFUL OF MILK OR CREAM ADD A TABLESPOONFUL OF BUTTER OR CRISCO AND COOK IN A RICE BOILER OR STEAMER UNTIL THE PEAS ARE NICELY DONE A FEW BAY LEAVES AND BLACK PEPPER GRAINS
1335-163935-0030 TAKE A CUP OF RICE
1335-163935-0031 A TEN CENT TIN OF BAKER'S COCOANUT DOES VERY NICELY IF ONE DOESN'T CARE TO PREPARE THE FRESH COCOANUT BOIL THE RICE AND COCOANUT TOGETHER BEING SURE TO ADD TO THE WATER THE COCOANUT MILK
1335-163935-0032 THERE SHOULD BE ABOUT THREE INCHES OF LIQUID ABOVE THE RICE COLOR THE LIQUID YELLOW WITH A LITTLE TURMERIC ADD SALT SIX CLOVES TWO CARDAMON SEEDS AND TWELVE PEPPER BERRIES
1335-163935-0033 COOK IN A RICE BOILER OR STEAMER UNTIL DONE
1335-163935-0034 A VERY NICE WAY OF MAKING HASH IS TO USE RICE INSTEAD OF POTATOES TAKE COLD MEAT AND GRAVY AND STEW TOGETHER WITH ONION WHEN THE ONION IS NEARLY DONE ADD TO THE BROTH THE RICE
1335-163935-0035 A QUARTER AS MUCH UNCOOKED RICE AS THERE IS MEAT IS A GOOD PROPORTION COOK ALL TOGETHER UNTIL RICE IS THOROUGHLY DONE BE SURE AND HAVE PLENTY OF LIQUID TO START WITH
1335-163935-0036 LEFT OVER PULLAO OR KIDGERI OR MEAT AND RICE HASH MAKE FINE CUTLETS MOLD ROLL IN CRUMBS AND FRY IN THE USUAL WAY
1335-163935-0037 COOK UNTIL THE SUGAR MELTS AND BEGINS TO BUBBLE THEN QUICKLY ADD TWO CUPS OF BOILING WATER
1335-163935-0038 OR BETTER STILL IN A RICE BOILER UNTIL RICE IS THOROUGHLY COOKED IT CAN HARDLY BE COOKED TOO MUCH REMOVE FROM THE FIRE POUR OVER ALL A HALF OUNCE OF ROSE WATER AND STIR WELL
1335-163935-0039 PRESS IN PLATES AND SPRINKLE WELL WITH MINCED ALMONDS
