5248-2163-0011 WHO HAS NOT CHEATED THE POLICE THE LAW WHO HAS NOT QUICKLY TAKEN ON AN AIR OF HONORABLE LOYALTY BEFORE THE SHERIFF'S OFFICER WHO MEETS HIM IN ORDER TO CONCEAL AN ILLEGALITY
5248-2163-0012 HE WHO HAS NOT DONE IT HAS SIMPLY LET VIOLENCE BE DONE TO HIM HE WAS A WEAKLING FROM CONSCIENCE I KNOW THAT MY FREEDOM IS DIMINISHED EVEN BY MY NOT BEING ABLE TO CARRY OUT MY WILL ON ANOTHER OBJECT

5248-2163-0018 MY INABILITY TO TOUCH YOU I YET REMEMBER IT AGAINST YOU VIGOROUS MEN HAVE ALWAYS DONE SO WHEN THE LOYAL HAD EXALTED AN UNSUBDUED POWER TO BE THEIR MASTER AND HAD ADORED IT WHEN THEY HAD
5248-2163-0019 DEMANDED ADORATION FROM ALL THEN THERE CAME SOME SUCH SON OF NATURE WHO WOULD NOT LOYALLY SUBMIT AND DROVE THE ADORED POWER FROM ITS INACCESSIBLE OLYMPUS HE CRIED HIS STAND STILL TO THE ROLLING SUN
5248-2163-0020 IN VAIN FOR FREEDOM AND ARE LECTURED FOR IT BY THE CABINET MINISTERS
5248-2163-0021 MIGHT IS A FINE THING AND USEFUL FOR MANY PURPOSES FOR ONE GOES FURTHER WITH A HANDFUL OF MIGHT THAN WITH A BAGFUL OF RIGHT YOU LONG FOR FREEDOM YOU FOOLS IF YOU TOOK MIGHT FREEDOM WOULD COME OF ITSELF
5248-2163-0022 THAT I CAN HAVE ONLY SO MUCH FREEDOM AS I PROCURE FOR MYSELF BY MY OWNNESS OF WHAT USE IS IT TO SHEEP THAT NO ONE ABRIDGES THEIR FREEDOM OF SPEECH THEY STICK TO BLEATING GIVE ONE WHO IS INWARDLY A MOHAMMEDAN
5248-2163-0023 A JEW OR A CHRISTIAN PERMISSION TO SPEAK WHAT HE LIKES HE WILL YET UTTER ONLY NARROW MINDED STUFF IF ON THE CONTRARY CERTAIN OTHERS ROB YOU OF THE FREEDOM OF SPEAKING AND HEARING THEY KNOW QUITE RIGHTLY WHEREIN LIES THEIR TEMPORARY ADVANTAGE
5248-2163-0024 AS YOU WOULD PERHAPS BE ABLE TO SAY AND HEAR SOMETHING WHEREBY THOSE CERTAIN PERSONS WOULD LOSE THEIR CREDIT IF THEY NEVERTHELESS GIVE YOU FREEDOM THEY ARE SIMPLY KNAVES WHO GIVE MORE THAN THEY HAVE FOR THEN THEY GIVE YOU NOTHING OF THEIR OWN
5248-2163-0025 BUT STOLEN WARES THEY GIVE YOU YOUR OWN FREEDOM THE FREEDOM THAT YOU MUST TAKE FOR YOURSELVES AND THEY GIVE IT TO YOU ONLY THAT YOU MAY NOT TAKE IT AND CALL THE THIEVES AND CHEATS TO AN ACCOUNT TO BOOT IN THEIR SLYNESS THEY KNOW WELL THAT GIVEN
5248-2163-0026 CHARTERED FREEDOM IS NO FREEDOM SINCE ONLY THE FREEDOM ONE TAKES FOR HIMSELF THEREFORE THE EGOIST'S FREEDOM RIDES WITH FULL SAILS DONATED FREEDOM STRIKES ITS SAILS AS SOON AS THERE COMES A STORM OR CALM IT REQUIRES ALWAYS A
5248-2163-0027 BEHAVE AS IF YOU WERE OF AGE AND YOU ARE SO WITHOUT ANY DECLARATION OF MAJORITY IF YOU DO NOT BEHAVE ACCORDINGLY YOU ARE NOT WORTHY OF IT
5248-2163-0028 WHEN THE GREEKS WERE OF AGE THEY DROVE OUT THEIR TYRANTS AND WHEN THE SON IS OF AGE HE MAKES HIMSELF INDEPENDENT OF HIS FATHER
5248-2163-0029 GRACIOUSLY ALLOWED THEM THEIR MAJORITY THEY MIGHT HAVE WAITED LONG A SENSIBLE FATHER THROWS OUT A SON WHO WILL NOT COME OF AGE AND KEEPS THE HOUSE TO HIMSELF IT SERVES THE NOODLE RIGHT THE MAN WHO IS SET FREE IS NOTHING BUT A FREEDMAN
5248-2163-0030 A LIBERTINUS A DOG DRAGGING A PIECE OF CHAIN WITH HIM HE IS AN UNFREE MAN IN THE GARMENT OF FREEDOM LIKE THE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN EMANCIPATED JEWS ARE NOTHING BETTERED IN THEMSELVES
5248-2163-0031 BUT ONLY RELIEVED AS JEWS ALTHOUGH HE WHO RELIEVES THEIR CONDITION IS CERTAINLY MORE THAN A CHURCHLY CHRISTIAN AS THE LATTER CANNOT DO THIS WITHOUT INCONSISTENCY BUT EMANCIPATED OR NOT EMANCIPATED JEW REMAINS JEW
5248-2163-0032 HE WHO IS NOT SELF FREED IS MERELY AN EMANCIPATED MAN THE PROTESTANT STATE CAN CERTAINLY SET FREE EMANCIPATE THE CATHOLICS BUT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT MAKE THEMSELVES FREE THEY REMAIN SIMPLY CATHOLICS SELFISHNESS AND UNSELFISHNESS HAVE ALREADY BEEN SPOKEN OF
5248-2163-0033 IS DIRECTED AGAINST EGOISM FOR THE EGOIST YOU KNOW NEVER TAKES TROUBLE ABOUT A THING FOR THE SAKE OF THE THING BUT FOR HIS SAKE THE THING MUST SERVE HIM IT IS EGOISTIC TO ASCRIBE TO NO THING A VALUE OF ITS OWN AN ABSOLUTE VALUE
5248-2163-0034 BUT TO SEEK ITS VALUE IN ME ONE OFTEN HEARS THAT POT BOILING STUDY WHICH IS SO COMMON COUNTED AMONG THE MOST REPULSIVE TRAITS OF EGOISTIC BEHAVIOR BECAUSE IT MANIFESTS THE MOST SHAMEFUL DESECRATION OF SCIENCE
5248-2163-0035 IS A LIMITED POWER BUT THE EGOISTIC ELEMENT IN IT AND THE DESECRATION OF SCIENCE ONLY A POSSESSED MAN CAN BLAME BECAUSE CHRISTIANITY INCAPABLE OF LETTING THE INDIVIDUAL COUNT AS AN EGO
5248-2163-0036 THOUGHT OF HIM ONLY AS A DEPENDENT AND WAS PROPERLY NOTHING BUT A SOCIAL THEORY A DOCTRINE OF LIVING TOGETHER AND THAT OF MAN WITH GOD AS WELL AS OF MAN WITH MAN
5248-2163-0037 FORMERLY MEANT ONLY BOLD BRAVE FREVEL WANTON OUTRAGE WAS ONLY DARING IT IS WELL KNOWN HOW ASKANCE THE WORD REASON WAS LOOKED AT FOR A LONG TIME
5248-2163-0038 THEREFORE SELFISHNESS IS IN A BAD WAY TOO SELFISHNESS
5248-2163-0039 I LOOK ONLY TO SEE WHETHER ANYTHING IS OF USE TO ME AS A SENSUAL MAN BUT IS SENSUALITY THEN THE WHOLE OF MY OWNNESS
5248-2163-0040 DO I FOLLOW MYSELF MY OWN DETERMINATION WHEN I FOLLOW THAT
5248-2163-0041 INSTEAD OF BEING MASTERED EITHER BY SENSUALITY OR BY ANYTHING ELSE GOD MAN AUTHORITY LAW STATE CHURCH ET CETERA WHAT IS OF USE TO ME THIS SELF OWNED OR SELF APPERTAINING ONE MY SELFISHNESS PURSUES
5248-2163-0042 AND SETS FORTH IN A DETAILED SPEECH THAT REMOVABLE DISMISSABLE TRANSFERABLE AND PENSIONABLE JUDGES IN SHORT SUCH MEMBERS OF A COURT OF JUSTICE AS CAN BY MERE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS BE DAMAGED AND ENDANGERED ARE WHOLLY WITHOUT RELIABILITY
5248-2163-0043 YES LOSE ALL RESPECT AND ALL CONFIDENCE AMONG THE PEOPLE THE WHOLE BENCH WELCKER CRIES IS DEMORALIZED BY THIS DEPENDENCE IN BLUNT WORDS THIS MEANS NOTHING ELSE THAN THAT THE JUDGES
5248-2163-0044 WOULD HAVE THEM THAN TO GIVE IT AS THE LAW WOULD HAVE THEM HOW IS THAT TO BE HELPED PERHAPS BY BRINGING HOME TO THE JUDGES HEARTS THE IGNOMINIOUSNESS OF THEIR VENALITY AND THEN CHERISHING
5248-2163-0045 THE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WILL REPENT AND HENCEFORTH PRIZE JUSTICE MORE HIGHLY THAN THEIR SELFISHNESS NO THE PEOPLE DOES NOT SOAR TO THIS ROMANTIC CONFIDENCE FOR IT FEELS THAT SELFISHNESS IS MIGHTIER THAN ANY OTHER MOTIVE THEREFORE THE SAME PERSONS
5248-2163-0046 WHO HAVE BEEN JUDGES HITHERTO MAY REMAIN SO HOWEVER THOROUGHLY ONE HAS CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT THEY BEHAVED AS EGOISTS ONLY THEY MUST NOT ANY LONGER
5248-2163-0047 FIND THEIR SELFISHNESS FAVORED BY THE VENALITY OF JUSTICE BUT MUST STAND SO INDEPENDENT OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT BY A JUDGMENT IN CONFORMITY WITH THE FACTS THEY DO NOT THROW INTO THE SHADE THEIR OWN CAUSE
5248-2163-0048 ONLY WHEN THEY CAN COUNT ON SELFISHNESS WHAT IS ONE TO THINK THEN OF THE COUNTLESS PHRASES OF UNSELFISHNESS WITH WHICH THEIR MOUTHS OVERFLOW AT OTHER TIMES TO A CAUSE WHICH I AM PUSHING SELFISHLY
5248-2163-0049 I HAVE ANOTHER RELATION THAN TO ONE WHICH I AM SERVING UNSELFISHLY THE FOLLOWING CRITERION MIGHT BE CITED FOR IT AGAINST THE ONE I CAN SIN OR COMMIT A SIN THE OTHER I CAN ONLY TRIFLE AWAY PUSH FROM ME DEPRIVE MYSELF OF
5248-2163-0050 FREE TRADE IS LOOKED AT IN BOTH WAYS BEING REGARDED PARTLY AS A FREEDOM WHICH MAY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES BE GRANTED OR WITHDRAWN PARTLY AS ONE WHICH IS TO BE HELD SACRED UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES
5248-2163-0051 AND DO NOT DESIRE IT FOR ITS OWN SAKE THEN I DESIRE IT SOLELY AS A MEANS TO AN END FOR ITS USEFULNESS FOR THE SAKE OF ANOTHER END E G OYSTERS FOR A PLEASANT FLAVOR NOW WILL NOT EVERY THING WHOSE FINAL END
5248-2163-0052 HE HIMSELF IS SERVE THE EGOIST AS MEANS
