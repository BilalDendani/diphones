1845-147962-0000 THE FIRST SNOWFALL CAME EARLY IN DECEMBER I REMEMBER HOW THE WORLD LOOKED FROM OUR SITTING ROOM WINDOW AS I DRESSED BEHIND THE STOVE THAT MORNING THE LOW SKY WAS LIKE A SHEET OF METAL THE BLOND CORNFIELDS HAD FADED OUT INTO GHOSTLINESS AT LAST
1845-147962-0001 THE LITTLE POND WAS FROZEN UNDER ITS STIFF WILLOW BUSHES BIG WHITE FLAKES WERE WHIRLING OVER EVERYTHING AND DISAPPEARING IN THE RED GRASS BEYOND THE POND ON THE SLOPE THAT CLIMBED TO THE CORNFIELD THERE WAS FAINTLY MARKED IN THE GRASS
1845-147962-0002 WHENEVER ONE LOOKED AT THIS SLOPE AGAINST THE SETTING SUN THE CIRCLE SHOWED LIKE A PATTERN IN THE GRASS AND THIS MORNING WHEN THE FIRST LIGHT SPRAY OF SNOW LAY OVER IT IT CAME OUT WITH WONDERFUL DISTINCTNESS LIKE STROKES OF CHINESE WHITE ON CANVAS
1845-147962-0003 AND SEEMED A GOOD OMEN FOR THE WINTER AS SOON AS THE SNOW HAD PACKED HARD I BEGAN TO DRIVE ABOUT THE COUNTRY IN A CLUMSY SLEIGH THAT OTTO FUCHS MADE FOR ME BY FASTENING A WOODEN GOODS BOX ON BOBS
1845-147962-0004 IT WAS A BRIGHT COLD DAY I PILED STRAW AND BUFFALO ROBES INTO THE BOX AND TOOK TWO HOT BRICKS WRAPPED IN OLD BLANKETS WHEN I GOT TO THE SHIMERDAS I DID NOT GO UP TO THE HOUSE
1845-147962-0005 BUT SAT IN MY SLEIGH AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DRAW AND CALLED ANTONIA AND YULKA CAME RUNNING OUT WEARING LITTLE RABBIT SKIN HATS THEIR FATHER HAD MADE FOR THEM THEY HAD HEARD ABOUT MY SLEDGE FROM AMBROSCH AND KNEW WHY I HAD COME
1845-147962-0006 THEY TUMBLED IN BESIDE ME AND WE SET OFF TOWARD THE NORTH ALONG A ROAD THAT HAPPENED TO BE BROKEN THE SKY WAS BRILLIANTLY BLUE AND THE SUNLIGHT ON THE GLITTERING WHITE STRETCHES OF PRAIRIE WAS ALMOST BLINDING AS ANTONIA SAID
1845-147962-0007 THE WHOLE WORLD WAS CHANGED BY THE SNOW WE KEPT LOOKING IN VAIN FOR FAMILIAR LANDMARKS THE DEEP ARROYO THROUGH WHICH SQUAW CREEK WOUND WAS NOW ONLY A CLEFT BETWEEN SNOW DRIFTS VERY BLUE WHEN ONE LOOKED DOWN INTO IT
1845-147962-0008 THE TREE TOPS THAT HAD BEEN GOLD ALL THE AUTUMN WERE DWARFED AND TWISTED AS IF THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE ANY LIFE IN THEM AGAIN THE FEW LITTLE CEDARS WHICH WERE SO DULL AND DINGY BEFORE NOW STOOD OUT A STRONG DUSKY GREEN
1845-147962-0009 THE WIND HAD THE BURNING TASTE OF FRESH SNOW MY THROAT AND NOSTRILS SMARTED AS IF SOME ONE HAD OPENED A HARTSHORN BOTTLE THE COLD STUNG AND AT THE SAME TIME DELIGHTED ONE MY HORSE'S BREATH ROSE LIKE STEAM
1845-147962-0010 AND WHENEVER WE STOPPED HE SMOKED ALL OVER THE CORNFIELDS GOT BACK A LITTLE OF THEIR COLOR UNDER THE DAZZLING LIGHT AND STOOD THE PALEST POSSIBLE GOLD IN THE SUN AND SNOW ALL ABOUT US THE SNOW WAS CRUSTED IN SHALLOW TERRACES
1845-147962-0011 WITH TRACINGS LIKE RIPPLE MARKS AT THE EDGES CURLY WAVES THAT WERE THE ACTUAL IMPRESSION OF THE STINGING LASH IN THE WIND THE GIRLS HAD ON COTTON DRESSES UNDER THEIR SHAWLS THEY KEPT SHIVERING BENEATH THE BUFFALO ROBES AND HUGGING EACH OTHER FOR WARMTH
1845-147962-0012 BUT THEY WERE SO GLAD TO GET AWAY FROM THEIR UGLY CAVE AND THEIR MOTHER'S SCOLDING THAT THEY BEGGED ME TO GO ON AND ON AS FAR AS RUSSIAN PETER'S HOUSE THE GREAT FRESH OPEN AFTER THE STUPEFYING WARMTH INDOORS MADE THEM BEHAVE LIKE WILD THINGS
1845-147962-0013 THEY LAUGHED AND SHOUTED AND SAID THEY NEVER WANTED TO GO HOME AGAIN COULD N'T WE SETTLE DOWN AND LIVE IN RUSSIAN PETER'S HOUSE YULKA ASKED AND COULD N'T I GO TO TOWN AND BUY THINGS FOR US TO KEEP HOUSE WITH ALL THE WAY TO RUSSIAN PETER'S WE WERE EXTRAVAGANTLY HAPPY
1845-147962-0014 BUT WHEN WE TURNED BACK IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK THE EAST WIND GREW STRONGER AND BEGAN TO HOWL THE SUN LOST ITS HEARTENING POWER AND THE SKY BECAME GRAY AND SOMBER I TOOK OFF MY LONG WOOLEN COMFORTER AND WOUND IT AROUND YULKA'S THROAT
1845-147962-0015 BUT I REFUSED TO GO IN WITH THEM AND GET WARM I KNEW MY HANDS WOULD ACHE TERRIBLY IF I WENT NEAR A FIRE YULKA FORGOT TO GIVE ME BACK MY COMFORTER AND I HAD TO DRIVE HOME DIRECTLY AGAINST THE WIND THE NEXT DAY I CAME DOWN WITH AN ATTACK OF QUINSY
1845-147962-0016 WHICH KEPT ME IN THE HOUSE FOR NEARLY TWO WEEKS THE BASEMENT KITCHEN SEEMED HEAVENLY SAFE AND WARM IN THOSE DAYS LIKE A TIGHT LITTLE BOAT IN A WINTER SEA THE MEN WERE OUT IN THE FIELDS ALL DAY HUSKING CORN AND WHEN THEY CAME IN AT NOON
1845-147962-0017 WITH LONG CAPS PULLED DOWN OVER THEIR EARS AND THEIR FEET IN RED LINED OVERSHOES I USED TO THINK THEY WERE LIKE ARCTIC EXPLORERS IN THE AFTERNOONS WHEN GRANDMOTHER SAT UPSTAIRS DARNING OR MAKING HUSKING GLOVES
1845-147962-0018 I READ THE SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON ALOUD TO HER AND I FELT THAT THE SWISS FAMILY HAD NO ADVANTAGES OVER US IN THE WAY OF AN ADVENTUROUS LIFE I WAS CONVINCED THAT MAN'S STRONGEST ANTAGONIST IS THE COLD
1845-147962-0019 I ADMIRED THE CHEERFUL ZEST WITH WHICH GRANDMOTHER WENT ABOUT KEEPING US WARM AND COMFORTABLE AND WELL FED SHE OFTEN REMINDED ME WHEN SHE WAS PREPARING FOR THE RETURN OF THE HUNGRY MEN THAT THIS COUNTRY WAS NOT LIKE VIRGINIA AND THAT HERE A COOK HAD
1845-147962-0020 STRIPED WITH CURRANTS AND BOILED IN A BAG NEXT TO GETTING WARM AND KEEPING WARM DINNER AND SUPPER WERE THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS WE HAD TO THINK ABOUT OUR LIVES CENTERED AROUND WARMTH AND FOOD AND THE RETURN OF THE MEN AT NIGHTFALL
1845-147962-0021 I USED TO WONDER WHEN THEY CAME IN TIRED FROM THE FIELDS THEIR FEET NUMB AND THEIR HANDS CRACKED AND SORE HOW THEY COULD DO ALL THE CHORES SO CONSCIENTIOUSLY FEED AND WATER AND BED THE HORSES MILK THE COWS AND LOOK AFTER THE PIGS
1845-147962-0022 WHEN SUPPER WAS OVER IT TOOK THEM A LONG WHILE TO GET THE COLD OUT OF THEIR BONES WHILE GRANDMOTHER AND I WASHED THE DISHES AND GRANDFATHER READ HIS PAPER UPSTAIRS JAKE AND OTTO SAT ON THE LONG BENCH BEHIND THE STOVE EASING THEIR INSIDE BOOTS
1845-147962-0023 OR RUBBING MUTTON TALLOW INTO THEIR CRACKED HANDS EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT WE POPPED CORN OR MADE TAFFY AND OTTO FUCHS USED TO SING FOR I AM A COWBOY AND KNOW I'VE DONE WRONG OR BURY ME NOT ON THE LONE PRAIREE
1845-147962-0024 AND JAKE'S SHAGGY HAIR SLICKED FLAT IN FRONT BY A WET COMB I CAN SEE THE SAG OF THEIR TIRED SHOULDERS AGAINST THE WHITEWASHED WALL WHAT GOOD FELLOWS THEY WERE HOW MUCH THEY KNEW AND HOW MANY THINGS THEY HAD KEPT FAITH WITH
1845-147962-0025 FUCHS HAD BEEN A COWBOY A STAGE DRIVER A BAR TENDER A MINER HAD WANDERED ALL OVER THAT GREAT WESTERN COUNTRY AND DONE HARD WORK EVERYWHERE THOUGH AS GRANDMOTHER SAID HE HAD NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT JAKE WAS DULLER THAN OTTO
1845-147962-0026 IT WAS A MATTER OF PRIDE WITH THEM NOT TO SPARE THEMSELVES YET THEY WERE THE SORT OF MEN WHO NEVER GET ON SOMEHOW OR DO ANYTHING BUT WORK HARD FOR A DOLLAR OR TWO A DAY ON THOSE BITTER STARLIT NIGHTS
1845-147962-0027 AS WE SAT AROUND THE OLD STOVE THAT FED US AND WARMED US AND KEPT US CHEERFUL WE COULD HEAR THE COYOTES HOWLING DOWN BY THE CORRALS AND THEIR HUNGRY WINTRY CRY USED TO REMIND THE BOYS OF WONDERFUL ANIMAL STORIES ABOUT GRAY WOLVES AND BEARS IN THE ROCKIES
1845-147962-0028 WILDCATS AND PANTHERS IN THE VIRGINIA MOUNTAINS SOMETIMES FUCHS COULD BE PERSUADED TO TALK ABOUT THE OUTLAWS AND DESPERATE CHARACTERS HE HAD KNOWN I REMEMBER ONE FUNNY STORY ABOUT HIMSELF THAT MADE GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS WORKING HER BREAD ON THE BREAD BOARD
1845-147962-0029 LAUGH UNTIL SHE WIPED HER EYES WITH HER BARE ARM HER HANDS BEING FLOURY IT WAS LIKE THIS WHEN OTTO LEFT AUSTRIA TO COME TO AMERICA HE WAS ASKED BY ONE OF HIS RELATIVES TO LOOK AFTER A WOMAN WHO WAS CROSSING ON THE SAME BOAT
1845-147962-0030 TO JOIN HER HUSBAND IN CHICAGO THE WOMAN STARTED OFF WITH TWO CHILDREN BUT IT WAS CLEAR THAT HER FAMILY MIGHT GROW LARGER ON THE JOURNEY FUCHS SAID HE GOT ON FINE WITH THE KIDS AND LIKED THE MOTHER THOUGH SHE PLAYED A SORRY TRICK ON HIM
1845-147962-0031 IN MID OCEAN SHE PROCEEDED TO HAVE NOT ONE BABY BUT THREE THIS EVENT MADE FUCHS THE OBJECT OF UNDESERVED NOTORIETY SINCE HE WAS TRAVELING WITH HER THE STEERAGE STEWARDESS WAS INDIGNANT WITH HIM THE DOCTOR REGARDED HIM WITH SUSPICION
1845-147962-0032 THE FIRST CABIN PASSENGERS WHO MADE UP A PURSE FOR THE WOMAN TOOK AN EMBARRASSING INTEREST IN OTTO AND OFTEN INQUIRED OF HIM ABOUT HIS CHARGE WHEN THE TRIPLETS WERE TAKEN ASHORE AT NEW YORK HE HAD AS HE SAID TO CARRY SOME OF THEM
1845-147962-0033 THE TRIP TO CHICAGO WAS EVEN WORSE THAN THE OCEAN VOYAGE ON THE TRAIN IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET MILK FOR THE BABIES AND TO KEEP THEIR BOTTLES CLEAN THE MOTHER DID HER BEST BUT NO WOMAN OUT OF HER NATURAL RESOURCES COULD FEED THREE BABIES THE HUSBAND IN CHICAGO
1845-147962-0034 BUT HE HAD A SULLEN EYE FOR ME ALL RIGHT NOW DID YOU EVER HEAR OF A YOUNG FELLER'S HAVING SUCH HARD LUCK MISSUS BURDEN
