2012-139358-0000 HE RESOLVED TO HAVE AN EXPLANATION WITH BENITO BENITO HE BEGAN AFTER TAKING HIM TO THE BOW OF THE JANGADA I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU
2012-139358-0001 I KNOW WHY HE SAID IT IS ABOUT TORRES YES BENITO AND I ALSO WISH TO SPEAK TO YOU YOU HAVE THEN NOTICED HIS ATTENTION TO MINHA
2012-139358-0002 TURNING PALE AH IT IS NOT A FEELING OF JEALOUSY THOUGH THAT EXASPERATES YOU AGAINST SUCH A MAN SAID BENITO QUICKLY
2012-139358-0003 DECIDEDLY NOT HEAVEN FORBID I SHOULD DO SUCH AN INJURY TO THE GIRL WHO IS TO BECOME MY WIFE NO BENITO SHE HOLDS THE ADVENTURER IN HORROR
2012-139358-0004 BUT IT DISTRESSES ME TO SEE THIS ADVENTURER CONSTANTLY OBTRUDING HIMSELF BY HIS PRESENCE AND CONVERSATION ON YOUR MOTHER AND SISTER AND SEEKING TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF INTO THAT INTIMACY WITH YOUR FAMILY WHICH IS ALREADY MINE
2012-139358-0005 LISTEN TO ME MANOEL CONTINUED BENITO YOU HAVE OBSERVED TORRES WELL HAVE YOU NOT YOU HAVE REMARKED HIS ATTENTIONS TO MY SISTER
2012-139358-0006 NOTHING CAN BE TRUER BUT WHILE YOU HAVE BEEN NOTICING THAT HAVE YOU NOT SEEN THAT THIS ANNOYING MAN NEVER KEEPS HIS EYES OFF MY FATHER NO MATTER IF HE IS NEAR TO HIM OR FAR FROM HIM AND THAT HE SEEMS TO HAVE SOME SPITEFUL SECRET INTENTION IN WATCHING HIM WITH SUCH UNACCOUNTABLE PERSISTENCY
2012-139358-0007 WHAT I KNOW NOT BUT TO FORCE MY FATHER TO GET RID OF TORRES WOULD PERHAPS BE IMPRUDENT I REPEAT IT I AM AFRAID THOUGH NO POSITIVE FACT ENABLES ME TO EXPLAIN MY FEAR TO MYSELF AND BENITO SEEMED TO SHUDDER WITH ANGER AS HE SAID THESE WORDS
2012-139358-0008 AND WE SHALL BE RELIEVED OF HIS PRESENCE FOR GOOD TILL THEN WE MUST KEEP OUR EYES ON HIM YOU UNDERSTAND ME MANOEL ASKED BENITO I UNDERSTAND YOU MY FRIEND MY BROTHER REPLIED MANOEL ALTHOUGH I DO NOT SHARE AND CANNOT SHARE YOUR FEARS
2012-139358-0009 WHAT CONNECTION CAN POSSIBLY EXIST BETWEEN YOUR FATHER AND THIS ADVENTURER EVIDENTLY YOUR FATHER HAS NEVER SEEN HIM I DO NOT SAY THAT MY FATHER KNOWS TORRES SAID BENITO BUT ASSUREDLY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TORRES KNOWS MY FATHER
2012-139358-0010 WHAT WAS THE FELLOW DOING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE FAZENDA WHEN WE MET HIM IN THE FOREST OF IQUITOS WHY DID HE THEN REFUSE THE HOSPITALITY WHICH WE OFFERED SO AS TO AFTERWARD MANAGE TO FORCE HIMSELF ON US AS OUR TRAVELING COMPANION WE ARRIVE
2012-139358-0011 AT TABATINGA AND THERE HE IS AS IF HE WAS WAITING FOR US THE PROBABILITY IS THAT THESE MEETINGS WERE IN PURSUANCE OF A PRECONCEIVED PLAN WHEN I SEE THE SHIFTY DOGGED LOOK OF TORRES ALL THIS CROWDS ON MY MIND I DO NOT KNOW
2012-139358-0012 I AM LOSING MYSELF IN THINGS THAT DEFY EXPLANATION OH WHY DID I EVER THINK OF OFFERING TO TAKE HIM ON BOARD THIS RAFT BE CALM BENITO I PRAY YOU
2012-139358-0013 TORRES LOOKED SLYLY AT THE TWO YOUNG MEN BUT SAID NOT A WORD
2012-139358-0014 AS LONG AS HE FANCIED HE WAS UNOBSERVED NO HE WAS NOT DECEIVED WHEN HE SAID THAT TORRES FACE GREW EVIL WHEN HE LOOKED AT HIS FATHER BY WHAT MYSTERIOUS BOND COULD THESE TWO MEN ONE NOBLENESS ITSELF THAT WAS SELF EVIDENT

2012-139358-0019 AFTER HAVING ASCERTAINED THAT THE TREES WELL PREPARED BY THE RIVER FLOODS WHICH HAVE BATHED THEIR STEMS TO A HEIGHT OF ABOUT FOUR FEET ARE IN GOOD CONDITION FOR THE HARVEST
2012-139358-0020 BELOW THE WOUND SMALL POTS ARE ATTACHED WHICH TWENTY FOUR HOURS SUFFICE TO FILL WITH A MILKY SAP IT CAN ALSO BE COLLECTED BY MEANS OF A HOLLOW BAMBOO AND A RECEPTACLE PLACED ON THE GROUND AT THE FOOT OF THE TREE
2012-139358-0021 THE SAP BEING OBTAINED THE INDIANS TO PREVENT THE SEPARATION OF ITS PECULIAR RESINS
2012-139358-0022 BY SPREADING OUT THE SAP ON A WOODEN SCOOP AND SHAKING IT IN THE SMOKE ITS COAGULATION IS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY OBTAINED IT ASSUMES A GRAYISH YELLOW TINGE AND SOLIDIFIES THE LAYERS FORMED IN SUCCESSION ARE DETACHED FROM THE SCOOP

2012-139358-0031 YES SAID BENITO IT IS FORTUNATE FOR THEY ARE SUFFICIENTLY FORMIDABLE CREATURES OFTEN AT THE CLOSE OF THE DAY THESE SAURIANS LOVE TO STRETCH THEMSELVES ON THE SHORE AND INSTALL THEMSELVES COMFORTABLY THERE TO PASS THE NIGHT
2012-139358-0032 EITHER BY SWIMMING THROUGH THE WATERS PROPELLED BY THEIR TAILS OR RUNNING ALONG THE BANK WITH A SPEED NO MAN CAN EQUAL IT IS ON THESE HUGE BEACHES THAT THE CAYMANS ARE BORN LIVE AND DIE NOT WITHOUT AFFORDING EXTRAORDINARY EXAMPLES OF LONGEVITY
2012-139358-0033 NOT ONLY CAN THE OLD ONES THE CENTENARIANS BE RECOGNIZED BY THE GREENISH MOSS WHICH CARPETS THEIR CARCASS AND IS SCATTERED OVER THEIR PROTUBERANCES BUT BY THEIR NATURAL FEROCITY WHICH INCREASES WITH AGE AS BENITO SAID

2012-139358-0036 THE TWO YOUNG MEN AND FRAGOSO AND JOAM GARRAL THINKING NO MORE OF DANGER RUSHED OUT OF THE HOUSE GUNS IN HAND SCARCELY WERE THEY OUTSIDE WHEN TWO OF THE ALLIGATORS MADE A HALF TURN AND RAN TOWARD THEM
2012-139358-0037 A DOSE OF BUCKSHOT TO THE HEAD CLOSE TO THE EYE FROM BENITO STOPPED ONE OF THE MONSTERS
2012-139358-0038 AND AFTER KNOCKING HIM OVER WITH A SWEEP OF HIS TAIL RAN AT HIM WITH OPEN JAWS AT THIS MOMENT TORRES RUSHED FROM THE CABIN HATCHET IN HAND AND STRUCK SUCH A TERRIFIC BLOW THAT ITS EDGE SUNK INTO THE JAW OF THE CAYMAN AND LEFT HIM DEFENSELESS
2012-139358-0039 BLINDED BY THE BLOOD THE ANIMAL FLEW TO THE SIDE AND DESIGNEDLY OR NOT FELL OVER AND WAS LOST IN THE STREAM MINHA MINHA SHOUTED MANOEL IN DISTRACTION WHEN HE GOT TO THE BOW OF THE JANGADA SUDDENLY SHE CAME INTO VIEW
2012-139358-0040 SHE HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN THE CABIN OF ARAUJO AND THE CABIN HAD JUST BEEN UPSET BY A POWERFUL BLOW FROM THE THIRD ALLIGATOR
2012-139358-0041 WHO WAS NOT SIX FEET AWAY FROM HER MINHA FELL A SECOND SHOT FROM BENITO FAILED TO STOP THE CAYMAN
2012-139358-0042 AND THE SCALES FLEW TO SPLINTERS BUT THE BALL DID NOT PENETRATE MANOEL THREW HIMSELF AT THE GIRL TO RAISE HER OR TO SNATCH HER FROM DEATH A SIDE BLOW FROM THE ANIMAL'S TAIL KNOCKED HIM DOWN TOO MINHA FAINTED AND THE MOUTH OF THE ALLIGATOR OPENED TO CRUSH HER
2012-139358-0043 AND THEN FRAGOSO JUMPED IN TO THE ANIMAL AND THRUST IN A KNIFE TO THE VERY BOTTOM OF HIS THROAT AT THE RISK OF HAVING HIS ARM SNAPPED OFF BY THE TWO JAWS HAD THEY QUICKLY CLOSED FRAGOSO PULLED OUT HIS ARM IN TIME BUT HE COULD NOT AVOID THE CHOCK OF THE CAYMAN
2012-139358-0044 AND WAS HURLED BACK INTO THE RIVER WHOSE WATERS REDDENED ALL AROUND FRAGOSO FRAGOSO SHRIEKED LINA KNEELING ON THE EDGE OF THE RAFT A SECOND AFTERWARD FRAGOSO REAPPEARED ON THE SURFACE OF THE AMAZON SAFE AND SOUND
2012-139358-0045 IN THE FACE OF THIS FACT SO MUCH HAD TO BE ADMITTED MANOEL SAID THIS TO BENITO IN AN UNDERTONE THAT IS TRUE REPLIED BENITO EMBARRASSED YOU ARE RIGHT AND IN A SENSE IT IS ONE CRUEL CARE THE LESS
2012-139358-0046 NEVERTHELESS MANOEL MY SUSPICIONS STILL EXIST IT IS NOT ALWAYS A MAN'S WORST ENEMY WHO WISHES HIM DEAD
2012-139358-0047 THANK YOU TORRES HE SAID HOLDING OUT HIS HAND THE ADVENTURER TOOK A STEP OR TWO BACKWARD WITHOUT REPLYING TORRES CONTINUED JOAM I AM SORRY THAT WE ARE ARRIVING AT THE END OF OUR VOYAGE AND THAT IN A FEW DAYS WE MUST PART I OWE YOU
