4948-28016-0000 TREATING A CASE ACTIVELY A PHYSICIAN'S STORY
4948-28016-0001 TO ATTEND A GENTLEMAN OF RESPECTABILITY WHOSE WIFE A LADY OF INTELLIGENCE AND REFINEMENT HAD DISCOVERED HIM IN HIS ROOM LYING SENSELESS UPON THE FLOOR ON ARRIVING AT THE HOUSE I FOUND MISSUS H IN GREAT DISTRESS OF MIND
4948-28016-0002 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH MISTER H I ASKED ON MEETING HIS LADY WHO WAS IN TEARS AND LOOKING THE PICTURE OF DISTRESS I'M AFRAID IT IS APOPLEXY SHE REPLIED
4948-28016-0003 I FOUND HIM LYING UPON THE FLOOR WHERE HE HAD TO ALL APPEARANCE FALLEN SUDDENLY FROM HIS CHAIR HIS FACE IS PURPLE AND THOUGH HE BREATHES IT IS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY I WENT UP TO SEE MY PATIENT
4948-28016-0004 HE HAD BEEN LIFTED FROM THE FLOOR AND WAS NOW LYING UPON THE BED SURE ENOUGH HIS FACE WAS PURPLE AND HIS BREATHING LABOURED BUT SOMEHOW THE SYMPTOMS DID NOT INDICATE APOPLEXY
4948-28016-0005 HADN'T HE BETTER BE BLED DOCTOR ASKED THE ANXIOUS WIFE I DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS NECESSARY I REPLIED I THINK IF WE LET HIM ALONE IT WILL PASS OFF IN THE COURSE OF A FEW HOURS A FEW HOURS
4948-28016-0006 HE MAY DIE IN HALF AN HOUR I DON'T THINK THE CASE IS SO DANGEROUS MADAM APOPLEXY NOT DANGEROUS I HARDLY THINK IT APOPLEXY I REPLIED PRAY WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS DOCTOR
4948-28016-0007 MISSUS H LOOKED ANXIOUSLY INTO MY FACE I DELICATELY HINTED THAT HE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN DRINKING TOO MUCH BRANDY BUT TO THIS SHE POSITIVELY AND ALMOST INDIGNANTLY OBJECTED
4948-28016-0008 DEPEND UPON IT THE DISEASE IS MORE DEEPLY SEATED I AM SURE HE HAD BETTER BE BLED WON'T YOU BLEED HIM DOCTOR A FEW OUNCES OF BLOOD TAKEN FROM HIS ARM MAY GIVE LIFE TO THE NOW STAGNANT CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD IN HIS VEINS
4948-28016-0009 THUS URGED I AFTER SOME REFLECTION ORDERED A BOWL AND BANDAGE AND OPENING A VEIN FROM WHICH THE BLOOD FLOWED FREELY RELIEVED HIM OF ABOUT EIGHT OUNCES OF HIS CIRCULATING MEDIUM
4948-28016-0010 BUT HE STILL LAY AS INSENSIBLE AS BEFORE MUCH TO THE DISTRESS OF HIS POOR WIFE SOMETHING ELSE MUST BE DONE DOCTOR SHE URGED SEEING THAT BLEEDING HAD ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING
4948-28016-0011 IF MY HUSBAND IS NOT QUICKLY RELIEVED HE MUST DIE BY THIS TIME SEVERAL FRIENDS AND RELATIVES WHO HAD BEEN SENT FOR ARRIVED AND URGED UPON ME THE ADOPTION OF SOME MORE ACTIVE MEANS FOR RESTORING THE SICK MAN TO CONSCIOUSNESS
4948-28016-0012 ONE PROPOSED MUSTARD PLASTERS ALL OVER HIS BODY ANOTHER A BLISTER ON THE HEAD ANOTHER HIS IMMERSION IN HOT WATER I SUGGESTED THAT IT MIGHT BE WELL TO USE A STOMACH PUMP
4948-28016-0013 PERHAPS HE HAS TAKEN SOME DRUG I REPLIED IMPOSSIBLE DOCTOR SAID THE WIFE HE HAS NOT BEEN FROM HOME TO DAY AND THERE IS NO DRUG OF ANY KIND IN THE HOUSE NO BRANDY I VENTURED THIS SUGGESTION AGAIN
4948-28016-0014 IN AN OFFENDED TONE I WAS NOT THE REGULAR FAMILY PHYSICIAN AND HAD BEEN CALLED IN TO MEET THE ALARMING EMERGENCY BECAUSE MY OFFICE HAPPENED TO BE NEAREST TO THE DWELLING OF MISTER H
4948-28016-0015 FEELING MY POSITION TO BE A DIFFICULT ONE I SUGGESTED THAT THE FAMILY PHYSICIAN HAD BETTER BE CALLED BUT THE DELAY DOCTOR URGED THE FRIENDS NO HARM WILL RESULT FROM IT BE ASSURED I REPLIED
4948-28016-0016 BUT MY WORDS DID NOT ASSURE THEM HOWEVER AS I WAS FIRM IN MY RESOLUTION NOT TO DO ANY THING MORE FOR THE PATIENT UNTIL DOCTOR S CAME THEY HAD TO SUBMIT
4948-28016-0017 I WISHED TO MAKE A CALL OF IMPORTANCE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND PROPOSED GOING TO BE BACK BY THE TIME DOCTOR S ARRIVED BUT THE FRIENDS OF THE SICK MAN WOULD NOT SUFFER ME TO LEAVE THE ROOM WHEN DOCTOR S CAME
4948-28016-0018 WE CONVERSED ASIDE FOR A FEW MINUTES AND I GAVE HIM MY VIEWS OF THE CASE AND STATED WHAT I HAD DONE AND WHY I HAD DONE IT WE THEN PROCEEDED TO THE BEDSIDE OF OUR PATIENT THERE WERE STILL NO SIGNS OF APPROACHING CONSCIOUSNESS
4948-28016-0019 DON'T YOU THINK HIS HEAD OUGHT TO BE SHAVED AND BLISTERED ASKED THE WIFE ANXIOUSLY DOCTOR S THOUGHT A MOMENT AND THEN SAID YES BY ALL MEANS SEND FOR A BARBER
4948-28016-0020 AND ALSO FOR A FRESH FLY BLISTER FOUR INCHES BY NINE I LOOKED INTO THE FACE OF DOCTOR S WITH SURPRISE IT WAS PERFECTLY GRAVE AND EARNEST I HINTED TO HIM MY DOUBT OF THE GOOD THAT MODE OF TREATMENT WOULD DO
4948-28016-0021 BUT HE SPOKE CONFIDENTLY OF THE RESULT AND SAID THAT IT WOULD NOT ONLY CURE THE DISEASE BUT HE BELIEVED
4948-28016-0022 WAS AFFECTED IN A HIGH DEGREE THE BARBER CAME THE HEAD OF H WAS SHAVED AND DOCTOR S APPLIED THE BLISTER WITH HIS OWN HANDS WHICH COMPLETELY COVERED THE SCALP FROM FOREHEAD TO OCCIPUT
4948-28016-0023 LET IT REMAIN ON FOR TWO HOURS AND THEN MAKE USE OF THE ORDINARY DRESSING SAID DOCTOR S IF HE SHOULD NOT RECOVER DURING THE ACTION OF THE BLISTER DON'T FEEL UNEASY SENSIBILITY WILL BE RESTORED SOON AFTER
4948-28016-0024 I DID NOT CALL AGAIN BUT I HEARD FROM DOCTOR S THE RESULT AFTER WE LEFT THE FRIENDS STOOD ANXIOUSLY AROUND THE BED UPON WHICH THE SICK MAN LAY
4948-28016-0025 BUT THOUGH THE BLISTER BEGAN TO DRAW NO SIGNS OF RETURNING CONSCIOUSNESS SHOWED THEMSELVES FURTHER THAN AN OCCASIONAL LOW MOAN OR AN UNEASY TOSSING OF THE ARMS
4948-28016-0026 AND WAS THEN REMOVED IT HAD DONE GOOD SERVICE DRESSINGS WERE THEN APPLIED REPEATED AND REPEATED AGAIN BUT STILL THE SICK MAN LAY IN A DEEP STUPOR IT HAS DONE NO GOOD
4948-28016-0027 HADN'T WE BETTER SEND FOR THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED THE WIFE JUST THEN THE EYES OF H OPENED AND HE LOOKED WITH HALF STUPID SURPRISE FROM FACE TO FACE OF THE ANXIOUS GROUP THAT SURROUNDED THE BED
4948-28016-0028 HE PLACED HIS HAND RATHER HEAVILY THEREON
4948-28016-0029 HEAVENS AND EARTH WHAT AILS MY HEAD FOR MERCY'S SAKE KEEP QUIET SAID THE WIFE THE GLAD TEARS GUSHING OVER HER FACE YOU HAVE BEEN VERY ILL THERE THERE NOW AND SHE SPOKE SOOTHINGLY DON'T SAY A WORD BUT LIE VERY STILL
4948-28016-0030 BUT MY HEAD WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH MY HEAD IT FEELS AS IF SCALDED WHERE'S MY HAIR HEAVENS AND EARTH SARAH I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS AND MY ARM WHAT'S MY ARM TIED UP IN THIS WAY FOR
4948-28016-0031 BE QUIET MY DEAR HUSBAND AND I'LL EXPLAIN IT ALL OH BE VERY QUIET YOUR LIFE DEPENDS UPON IT MISTER H SANK BACK UPON THE PILLOW FROM WHICH HE HAD ARISEN AND CLOSED HIS EYES TO THINK
4948-28016-0032 HE PUT HIS HAND TO HIS HEAD AND FELT IT TENDERLY ALL OVER FROM TEMPLE TO TEMPLE AND FROM NAPE TO FOREHEAD IS IT A BLISTER HE AT LENGTH ASKED
4948-28016-0033 YES DEAR YOU HAVE BEEN VERY ILL WE FEARED FOR YOUR LIFE SAID MISSUS H AFFECTIONATELY THERE HAVE BEEN TWO PHYSICIANS IN ATTENDANCE H CLOSED HIS EYES AGAIN HIS LIPS MOVED
4948-28016-0034 THOSE NEAREST WERE NOT MUCH EDIFIED BY THE WHISPERED WORDS THAT ISSUED THEREFROM THEY WOULD HAVE SOUNDED VERY STRANGELY IN A CHURCH OR TO EARS POLITE AND REFINED AFTER THIS HE LAY FOR SOME TIME QUIET
4948-28016-0035 THREATENED WITH APOPLEXY I SUPPOSE HE THEN SAID INTERROGATIVELY YES DEAR REPLIED HIS WIFE
4948-28016-0036 I FOUND YOU LYING INSENSIBLE UPON THE FLOOR ON HAPPENING TO COME INTO YOUR ROOM IT WAS MOST PROVIDENTIAL THAT I DISCOVERED YOU WHEN I DID OR YOU WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE DIED H SHUT HIS EYES AND MUTTERED SOMETHING WITH AN AIR OF IMPATIENCE
4948-28016-0037 BUT ITS MEANING WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD FINDING HIM OUT OF DANGER FRIENDS AND RELATIVES RETIRED AND THE SICK MAN WAS LEFT ALONE WITH HIS FAMILY
4948-28016-0038 THIS WAY I'M LAID UP FOR A WEEK OR TWO AND ALL FOR NOTHING IT WAS TO SAVE YOUR LIFE DEAR SAVE THE
4948-28016-0039 DO FOR MERCY'S SAKE BE QUIET EVERY THING DEPENDS UPON IT WITH A GESTURE OF IMPATIENCE H SHUT HIS EYES TEETH AND HANDS AND LAY PERFECTLY STILL FOR SOME MINUTES
4948-28016-0040 THEN HE TURNED HIS FACE TO THE WALL MUTTERING IN A LOW PETULANT VOICE TOO BAD TOO
4948-28016-0041 NEITHER HAD DOCTOR S ALTHOUGH HE USED A VERY EXTRAORDINARY MODE OF TREATMENT THE FACTS OF THE CASE WERE THESE H HAD A WEAKNESS HE COULD NOT TASTE WINE NOR STRONG DRINK
4948-28016-0042 WITHOUT BEING TEMPTED INTO EXCESS BOTH HIMSELF AND FRIENDS WERE MORTIFIED AND GRIEVED AT THIS AND THEY BY ADMONITION AND HE BY GOOD RESOLUTIONS TRIED TO BRING ABOUT A REFORM
4948-28016-0043 BUT TO SEE WAS TO TASTE TO TASTE WAS TO FALL AT LAST HIS FRIENDS URGED HIM TO SHUT HIMSELF UP AT HOME FOR A CERTAIN TIME AND SEE IF TOTAL ABSTINENCE WOULD NOT GIVE HIM STRENGTH
4948-28016-0044 HE GOT ON PRETTY WELL FOR A FEW DAYS PARTICULARLY SO AS HIS COACHMAN KEPT A WELL FILLED BOTTLE FOR HIM IN THE CARRIAGE HOUSE TO WHICH HE NOT UNFREQUENTLY RESORTED
4948-28016-0045 BUT A TOO ARDENT DEVOTION TO THIS BOTTLE BROUGHT ON THE SUPPOSED APOPLEXY DOCTOR S WAS RIGHT IN HIS MODE OF TREATING THE DISEASE AFTER ALL AND DID NOT ERR IN SUPPOSING THAT IT WOULD REACH THE PREDISPOSITION
4948-28016-0046 THE CURE WAS EFFECTUAL H KEPT QUIET ON THE SUBJECT AND BORE HIS SHAVED HEAD UPON HIS SHOULDERS WITH AS MUCH PHILOSOPHY AS HE COULD MUSTER A WIG AFTER THE SORES MADE BY THE BLISTER HAD DISAPPEARED
4948-28016-0047 CONCEALED THE BARBER'S WORK UNTIL HIS OWN HAIR GREW AGAIN HE NEVER VENTURED UPON WINE OR BRANDY AGAIN FOR FEAR OF APOPLEXY WHEN THE TRUTH LEAKED OUT AS LEAK OUT SUCH THINGS ALWAYS WILL
4948-28016-0048 THE FRIENDS OF H HAD MANY A HEARTY LAUGH BUT THEY WISELY CONCEALED FROM THE OBJECT OF THEIR MERRIMENT THE FACT THAT THEY KNEW ANY THING MORE THAN APPEARED OF THE CAUSE OF HIS SUPPOSED ILLNESS
