5984-56840-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN PENSIVE SHE MOURN'D
5984-56840-0001 AND HUNG HER LANGUID HEAD LIKE A FAIR LILY OVERCHARG'D WITH DEW CHARLOTTE HAD NOW BEEN LEFT ALMOST THREE MONTHS A PREY TO HER OWN MELANCHOLY REFLEXIONS
5984-56840-0002 SAD COMPANIONS INDEED NOR DID ANY ONE BREAK IN UPON HER SOLITUDE BUT BELCOUR WHO ONCE OR TWICE CALLED TO ENQUIRE AFTER HER HEALTH AND TELL HER HE HAD IN VAIN ENDEAVOURED TO BRING MONTRAVILLE TO HEAR REASON
5984-56840-0003 AND ONCE BUT ONLY ONCE WAS HER MIND CHEERED BY THE RECEIPT OF AN AFFECTIONATE LETTER FROM MISSUS BEAUCHAMP OFTEN HAD SHE WROTE TO HER PERFIDIOUS SEDUCER AND WITH THE MOST PERSUASIVE ELOQUENCE
5984-56840-0004 ENDEAVOURED TO CONVINCE HIM OF HER INNOCENCE BUT THESE LETTERS WERE NEVER SUFFERED TO REACH THE HANDS OF MONTRAVILLE OR THEY MUST THOUGH ON THE VERY EVE OF MARRIAGE HAVE PREVENTED HIS DESERTING THE WRETCHED GIRL
5984-56840-0005 REAL ANGUISH OF HEART HAD IN A GREAT MEASURE FADED HER CHARMS HER CHEEKS WERE PALE FROM WANT OF REST AND HER EYES BY FREQUENT INDEED ALMOST CONTINUED WEEPING WERE SUNK AND HEAVY
5984-56840-0006 SOMETIMES A GLEAM OF HOPE WOULD PLAY ABOUT HER HEART WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF HER PARENTS THEY CANNOT SURELY SHE WOULD SAY REFUSE TO FORGIVE ME OR SHOULD THEY DENY THEIR PARDON TO ME
5984-56840-0007 THEY WIN NOT HATE MY INNOCENT INFANT ON ACCOUNT OF ITS MOTHER'S ERRORS HOW OFTEN DID THE POOR MOURNER WISH FOR THE CONSOLING PRESENCE OF THE BENEVOLENT MISSUS BEAUCHAMP IF SHE WERE HERE
5984-56840-0008 SHE WOULD CRY SHE WOULD CERTAINLY COMFORT ME AND SOOTH THE DISTRACTION OF MY SOUL SHE WAS SITTING ONE AFTERNOON WRAPPED IN THESE MELANCHOLY REFLEXIONS WHEN SHE WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE ENTRANCE OF BELCOUR
5984-56840-0009 GREAT AS THE ALTERATION WAS WHICH INCESSANT SORROW HAD MADE ON HER PERSON SHE WAS STILL INTERESTING STILL CHARMING AND THE UNHALLOWED FLAME WHICH HAD URGED BELCOUR TO PLANT DISSENSION BETWEEN HER AND MONTRAVILLE
5984-56840-0010 THAT HE MIGHT BE A WITNESS TO HIS UNMANLY TRIUMPH WHEN HE ENTERED THE ROOM WHERE CHARLOTTE WAS SITTING HE ASSUMED THE LOOK OF TENDER CONSOLATORY FRIENDSHIP AND HOW DOES MY LOVELY CHARLOTTE
5984-56840-0011 SAID HE TAKING HER HAND I FEAR YOU ARE NOT SO WELL AS I COULD WISH I AM NOT WELL MISTER BELCOUR SAID SHE VERY FAR FROM IT
5984-56840-0012 BUT THE PAINS AND INFIRMITIES OF THE BODY I COULD EASILY BEAR NAY SUBMIT TO THEM WITH PATIENCE WERE THEY NOT AGGRAVATED BY THE MOST INSUPPORTABLE ANGUISH OF MY MIND
5984-56840-0013 DESERTED AND FORSAKEN AS I AM WITHOUT A FRIEND OF MY OWN SEX TO WHOM I CAN UNBURTHEN MY FULL HEART NAY MY FIDELITY SUSPECTED BY THE VERY MAN FOR WHOM I HAVE SACRIFICED EVERY THING VALUABLE IN LIFE
5984-56840-0014 FOR WHOM I HAVE MADE MYSELF A POOR DESPISED CREATURE AN OUTCAST FROM SOCIETY AN OBJECT ONLY OF CONTEMPT AND PITY YOU THINK TOO MEANLY OF YOURSELF MISS TEMPLE

5984-56840-0017 UNKNOWN AND UNPITIED HERE LET ME DIE UNLAMENTED AND MY NAME SINK TO OBLIVION
5984-56840-0018 BELCOUR WAS AWED TO SILENCE HE DARED NOT INTERRUPT HER AND AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE SHE PROCEEDED
5984-56840-0019 TO SEEK OUT THE STILL DEAR THOUGH CRUEL UNGENEROUS MONTRAVILLE TO THROW MYSELF AT HIS FEET AND ENTREAT HIS COMPASSION HEAVEN KNOWS NOT FOR MYSELF IF I AM NO LONGER BELOVED
5984-56840-0020 I WILL NOT BE INDEBTED TO HIS PITY TO REDRESS MY INJURIES BUT I WOULD HAVE KNELT AND ENTREATED HIM NOT TO FORSAKE MY POOR UNBORN SHE COULD SAY NO MORE A CRIMSON GLOW RUSHED OVER HER CHEEKS
5984-56840-0021 AND COVERING HER FACE WITH HER HANDS SHE SOBBED ALOUD SOMETHING LIKE HUMANITY WAS AWAKENED IN BELCOUR'S BREAST BY THIS PATHETIC SPEECH HE AROSE AND WALKED TOWARDS THE WINDOW BUT
5984-56840-0022 AT THE WORD ATTACHED A DEATH LIKE PALENESS OVERSPREAD THE COUNTENANCE OF CHARLOTTE BUT SHE APPLIED TO SOME HARTSHORN WHICH STOOD BESIDE HER AND BELCOUR PROCEEDED

5984-56840-0029 CRIED SHE IN A DISTRACTED ACCENT WHAT WITHOUT A LAST FAREWELL WITHOUT ONE THOUGHT ON MY UNHAPPY SITUATION OH MONTRAVILLE MAY GOD FORGIVE YOUR PERFIDY
5984-56840-0030 SHE SHRIEKED AND BELCOUR SPRANG FORWARD JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT HER FALLING TO THE FLOOR ALARMING FAINTINGS NOW SUCCEEDED EACH OTHER AND SHE WAS CONVEYED TO HER BED FROM WHENCE SHE EARNESTLY PRAYED
5984-56840-0031 SHE MIGHT NEVER MORE ARISE BELCOUR STAID WITH HER THAT NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING FOUND HER IN A HIGH FEVER THE FITS SHE HAD BEEN SEIZED WITH HAD GREATLY TERRIFIED HIM
5984-56840-0032 SHE WAS NO LONGER AN OBJECT OF DESIRE IT IS TRUE FOR SEVERAL DAYS HE WENT CONSTANTLY TO SEE HER BUT HER PALE EMACIATED APPEARANCE DISGUSTED HIM HIS VISITS BECAME LESS FREQUENT

5984-56840-0034 THIS DISGRACE TO HUMANITY AND MANHOOD AT LENGTH FORGOT EVEN THE INJURED CHARLOTTE AND ATTRACTED BY THE BLOOMING HEALTH OF A FARMER'S DAUGHTER
