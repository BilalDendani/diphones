5513-39476-0000 IN THE MORNING WHEN HE WOKE UP THEY HAD THE PLACE TO THEMSELVES FOR ON HIS INSTRUCTIONS THE SERVANTS HAD ALL LEFT FIRST THING JANET AND THE COOK TO OXFORD WHERE THEY WOULD TRY AND FIND NEW PLACES AND NANNY GOING BACK TO THE COTTAGE NEAR TANGLEY WHERE HER SON LIVED WHO WAS THE PIGMAN THERE
5513-39476-0001 SO WITH THAT MORNING THERE BEGAN WHAT WAS NOW TO BE THEIR ORDINARY LIFE TOGETHER HE WOULD GET UP WHEN IT WAS BROAD DAY AND FIRST THING LIGHT THE FIRE DOWNSTAIRS AND COOK THE BREAKFAST THEN BRUSH HIS WIFE SPONGE HER WITH A DAMP SPONGE THEN BRUSH HER AGAIN
5513-39476-0002 IN ALL THIS USING SCENT VERY FREELY TO HIDE SOMEWHAT HER RANK ODOUR WHEN SHE WAS DRESSED HE CARRIED HER DOWNSTAIRS AND THEY HAD THEIR BREAKFAST TOGETHER SHE SITTING UP TO TABLE WITH HIM DRINKING HER SAUCER OF TEA AND TAKING HER FOOD FROM HIS FINGERS
5513-39476-0003 SHE WAS STILL FOND OF THE SAME FOOD THAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO BEFORE HER TRANSFORMATION A LIGHTLY BOILED EGG OR SLICE OF HAM A PIECE OF BUTTERED TOAST OR TWO WITH A LITTLE QUINCE AND APPLE JAM
5513-39476-0004 WHILE I AM ON THE SUBJECT OF HER FOOD I SHOULD SAY THAT READING IN THE ENCYCLOPEDIA HE FOUND THAT FOXES ON THE CONTINENT ARE INORDINATELY FOND OF GRAPES AND THAT DURING THE AUTUMN SEASON THEY ABANDON THEIR ORDINARY DIET FOR THEM AND THEN GROW EXCEEDINGLY FAT AND LOSE THEIR OFFENSIVE ODOUR
5513-39476-0005 THAT IT IS STRANGE MISTER TEBRICK SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN IT AFTER READING THIS ACCOUNT HE WROTE TO LONDON FOR A BASKET OF GRAPES TO BE POSTED TO HIM TWICE A WEEK AND WAS REJOICED TO FIND THAT THE ACCOUNT IN THE ENCYCLOPEDIA WAS TRUE IN THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE PARTICULARS
5513-39476-0006 HIS VIXEN RELISHED THEM EXCEEDINGLY AND SEEMED NEVER TO TIRE OF THEM SO THAT HE INCREASED HIS ORDER FIRST FROM ONE POUND TO THREE POUNDS AND AFTERWARDS TO FIVE
5513-39476-0007 HER ODOUR ABATED SO MUCH BY THIS MEANS THAT HE CAME NOT TO NOTICE IT AT ALL EXCEPT SOMETIMES IN THE MORNINGS BEFORE HER TOILET WHAT HELPED MOST TO MAKE LIVING WITH HER BEARABLE FOR HIM WAS THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD HIM PERFECTLY YES EVERY WORD HE SAID
5513-39476-0008 AND THOUGH SHE WAS DUMB SHE EXPRESSED HERSELF VERY FLUENTLY BY LOOKS AND SIGNS THOUGH NEVER BY THE VOICE THUS HE FREQUENTLY CONVERSED WITH HER TELLING HER ALL HIS THOUGHTS AND HIDING NOTHING FROM HER
5513-39476-0009 SWEET PUSS SOME MEN WOULD PITY ME LIVING ALONE HERE WITH YOU AFTER WHAT HAS HAPPENED BUT I WOULD NOT CHANGE PLACES WHILE YOU WERE LIVING WITH ANY MAN FOR THE WHOLE WORLD THOUGH YOU ARE A FOX I WOULD RATHER LIVE WITH YOU THAN ANY WOMAN I SWEAR I WOULD
5513-39476-0010 AND THAT TOO IF YOU WERE CHANGED TO ANYTHING BUT THEN CATCHING HER GRAVE LOOK HE WOULD SAY DO YOU THINK I JEST ON THESE THINGS MY DEAR I DO NOT I SWEAR TO YOU MY DARLING THAT ALL MY LIFE I WILL BE TRUE TO YOU WILL BE FAITHFUL
5513-39476-0011 WILL RESPECT AND REVERENCE YOU WHO ARE MY WIFE AND I WILL DO THAT NOT BECAUSE OF ANY HOPE THAT GOD IN HIS MERCY WILL SEE FIT TO RESTORE YOUR SHAPE BUT SOLELY BECAUSE I LOVE YOU HOWEVER YOU MAY BE CHANGED MY LOVE IS NOT
5513-39476-0012 OFTEN HE WOULD SWEAR TO HER THAT THE DEVIL MIGHT HAVE POWER TO WORK SOME MIRACLES BUT THAT HE WOULD FIND IT BEYOND HIM TO CHANGE HIS LOVE FOR HER THESE PASSIONATE SPEECHES HOWEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE STRUCK HIS WIFE IN AN ORDINARY WAY NOW SEEMED TO BE HER CHIEF COMFORT
5513-39476-0013 SHE WOULD COME TO HIM PUT HER PAW IN HIS HAND AND LOOK AT HIM WITH SPARKLING EYES SHINING WITH JOY AND GRATITUDE WOULD PANT WITH EAGERNESS JUMP AT HIM AND LICK HIS FACE
5513-39476-0014 GETTING HIS MEALS SETTING THE ROOM STRAIGHT MAKING THE BED AND SO FORTH WHEN HE WAS DOING THIS HOUSEWORK IT WAS COMICAL TO WATCH HIS VIXEN OFTEN SHE WAS AS IT WERE BESIDE HERSELF WITH VEXATION AND DISTRESS TO SEE HIM IN HIS CLUMSY WAY
5513-39476-0015 DOING WHAT SHE COULD HAVE DONE SO MUCH BETTER HAD SHE BEEN ABLE
5513-39476-0016 SHE FOLLOWED HIM EVERYWHERE AND IF HE DID ONE THING WRONG SHE STOPPED HIM AND SHOWED HIM THE WAY OF IT WHEN HE HAD FORGOT THE HOUR FOR HIS MEAL SHE WOULD COME AND TUG HIS SLEEVE AND TELL HIM AS IF SHE SPOKE HUSBAND ARE WE TO HAVE NO LUNCHEON TO DAY
5513-39476-0017 THIS WOMANLINESS IN HER NEVER FAILED TO DELIGHT HIM FOR IT SHOWED SHE WAS STILL HIS WIFE BURIED AS IT WERE IN THE CARCASE OF A BEAST BUT WITH A WOMAN'S SOUL
5513-39476-0018 AT LAST SINCE HE COULD FIND NO REASON AGAINST IT HE WENT TO THE SHELF AND FETCHED DOWN A VOLUME OF THE HISTORY OF CLARISSA HARLOWE WHICH HE HAD BEGUN TO READ ALOUD TO HER A FEW WEEKS BEFORE
5513-39476-0019 GOOD GOD WHAT IS NOW TO BECOME OF ME MY FEET BENUMBED BY MIDNIGHT WANDERINGS THROUGH THE HEAVIEST DEWS THAT EVER FELL MY WIG AND MY LINEN DRIPPING WITH THE HOARFROST DISSOLVING ON THEM DAY BUT JUST BREAKING ET CETERA
5513-39476-0020 WHILE HE READ HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF HOLDING HER ATTENTION THEN AFTER A FEW PAGES THE STORY CLAIMED ALL HIS SO THAT HE READ ON FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER WHEN HE DID SO HE SAW THAT SHE WAS NOT LISTENING TO HIM
5513-39476-0021 BUT WAS WATCHING SOMETHING WITH STRANGE EAGERNESS SUCH A FIXED INTENT LOOK WAS ON HER FACE THAT HE WAS ALARMED AND SOUGHT THE CAUSE OF IT PRESENTLY HE FOUND THAT HER GAZE WAS FIXED ON THE MOVEMENTS OF HER PET DOVE WHICH WAS IN ITS CAGE HANGING IN THE WINDOW
5513-39476-0022 HE SPOKE TO HER BUT SHE SEEMED DISPLEASED SO HE LAID CLARISSA HARLOWE ASIDE NOR DID HE EVER REPEAT THE EXPERIMENT OF READING TO HER
5513-39476-0023 YET THAT SAME EVENING AS HE HAPPENED TO BE LOOKING THROUGH HIS WRITING TABLE DRAWER WITH PUSS BESIDE HIM LOOKING OVER HIS ELBOW SHE SPIED A PACK OF CARDS AND THEN HE WAS FORCED TO PICK THEM OUT TO PLEASE HER THEN DRAW THEM FROM THEIR CASE
5513-39476-0024 THEY HAD SOME DIFFICULTY AT FIRST IN CONTRIVING FOR HER TO HOLD HER CARDS AND THEN TO PLAY THEM
5513-39476-0025 AFTER WHICH SHE COULD FLIP THEM OUT VERY NEATLY WITH HER CLAWS AS SHE WANTED TO PLAY THEM WHEN THEY HAD OVERCOME THIS TROUBLE THEY PLAYED THREE GAMES AND MOST HEARTILY SHE SEEMED TO ENJOY THEM MOREOVER SHE WON ALL THREE OF THEM
5513-39476-0026 AFTER THIS THEY OFTEN PLAYED A QUIET GAME OF PIQUET TOGETHER AND CRIBBAGE TOO I SHOULD SAY THAT IN MARKING THE POINTS AT CRIBBAGE ON THE BOARD HE ALWAYS MOVED HER PEGS FOR HER AS WELL AS HIS OWN FOR SHE COULD NOT HANDLE THEM OR SET THEM IN THE HOLES
5513-39476-0027 THE WEATHER WHICH HAD BEEN DAMP AND MISTY WITH FREQUENT DOWNPOURS OF RAIN IMPROVED VERY MUCH IN THE FOLLOWING WEEK AND AS OFTEN HAPPENS IN JANUARY THERE WERE SEVERAL DAYS WITH THE SUN SHINING NO WIND AND LIGHT FROSTS AT NIGHT
5513-39476-0028 THESE FROSTS BECOMING MORE INTENSE AS THE DAYS WENT ON TILL BYE AND BYE THEY BEGAN TO THINK OF SNOW WITH THIS SPELL OF FINE WEATHER IT WAS BUT NATURAL THAT MISTER TEBRICK SHOULD THINK OF TAKING HIS VIXEN OUT OF DOORS
5513-39476-0029 THIS WAS SOMETHING HE HAD NOT YET DONE BOTH BECAUSE OF THE DAMP RAINY WEATHER UP TILL THEN AND BECAUSE THE MERE NOTION OF TAKING HER OUT FILLED HIM WITH ALARM INDEED HE HAD SO MANY APPREHENSIONS BEFOREHAND THAT AT ONE TIME HE RESOLVED TOTALLY AGAINST IT
5513-39476-0030 FOR HIS MIND WAS FILLED NOT ONLY WITH THE FEAR THAT SHE MIGHT ESCAPE FROM HIM AND RUN AWAY WHICH HE KNEW WAS GROUNDLESS BUT WITH MORE RATIONAL VISIONS SUCH AS WANDERING CURS TRAPS GINS SPRING GUNS BESIDES A DREAD OF BEING SEEN WITH HER BY THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
5513-39476-0031 AT LAST HOWEVER HE RESOLVED ON IT AND ALL THE MORE AS HIS VIXEN KEPT ASKING HIM IN THE GENTLEST WAY MIGHT SHE NOT GO OUT INTO THE GARDEN
5513-39476-0032 YET SHE ALWAYS LISTENED VERY SUBMISSIVELY WHEN HE TOLD HER THAT HE WAS AFRAID IF THEY WERE SEEN TOGETHER IT WOULD EXCITE THE CURIOSITY OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS BESIDES THIS HE OFTEN TOLD HER OF HIS FEARS FOR HER ON ACCOUNT OF DOGS
5513-39476-0033 AFTER THIS HE RESOLVED TO TAKE HER THOUGH WITH FULL PRECAUTIONS THAT IS HE LEFT THE HOUSE DOOR OPEN SO THAT IN CASE OF NEED SHE COULD BEAT A SWIFT RETREAT THEN HE TOOK HIS GUN UNDER HIS ARM AND LASTLY HE HAD HER WELL WRAPPED UP IN A LITTLE FUR JACKET LEST SHE SHOULD TAKE COLD
5513-39476-0034 FOR ALREADY HER FIRST HORROR OF BEING SEEN TO GO UPON ALL FOURS WAS WORN OFF REASONING NO DOUBT UPON IT THAT EITHER SHE MUST RESIGN HERSELF TO GO THAT WAY OR ELSE STAY BED RIDDEN ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE
5513-39476-0035 HER JOY AT GOING INTO THE GARDEN WAS INEXPRESSIBLE FIRST SHE RAN THIS WAY THEN THAT THOUGH KEEPING ALWAYS CLOSE TO HIM LOOKING VERY SHARPLY WITH EARS COCKED FORWARD FIRST AT ONE THING THEN ANOTHER AND THEN UP TO CATCH HIS EYE
5513-39476-0036 FOR SOME TIME INDEED SHE WAS ALMOST DANCING WITH DELIGHT RUNNING ROUND HIM THEN FORWARD A YARD OR TWO THEN BACK TO HIM AND GAMBOLLING BESIDE HIM AS THEY WENT ROUND THE GARDEN BUT IN SPITE OF HER JOY SHE WAS FULL OF FEAR
5513-39476-0037 AT EVERY NOISE A COW LOWING A COCK CROWING OR A PLOUGHMAN IN THE DISTANCE HULLOAING TO SCARE THE ROOKS SHE STARTED HER EARS PRICKED TO CATCH THE SOUND HER MUZZLE WRINKLED UP AND HER NOSE TWITCHED
5513-39476-0038 THEY WALKED ROUND THE GARDEN AND DOWN TO THE POND WHERE THERE WERE ORNAMENTAL WATERFOWL TEAL WIDGEON AND MANDARIN DUCKS AND SEEING THESE AGAIN GAVE HER GREAT PLEASURE
5513-39476-0039 FIRST SHE STARED AT THEM THEN BOUNCING UP TO HER HUSBAND'S KNEE SOUGHT TO KINDLE AN EQUAL EXCITEMENT IN HIS MIND WHILST SHE RESTED HER PAWS ON HIS KNEE SHE TURNED HER HEAD AGAIN AND AGAIN TOWARDS THE DUCKS AS THOUGH SHE COULD NOT TAKE HER EYES OFF THEM AND THEN RAN DOWN BEFORE HIM TO THE WATER'S EDGE
5513-39476-0040 BUT HER APPEARANCE THREW THE DUCKS INTO THE UTMOST DEGREE OF CONSTERNATION THOSE ON SHORE OR NEAR THE BANK SWAM OR FLEW TO THE CENTRE OF THE POND AND THERE HUDDLED IN A BUNCH AND THEN SWIMMING ROUND AND ROUND THEY BEGAN SUCH A QUACKING THAT MISTER TEBRICK WAS NEARLY DEAFENED
5513-39476-0041 AND SUCH INCIDENTS WERE PLENTIFUL EVER STOOD A CHANCE OF BEING SMILED AT BY HIM SO IN THIS CASE TOO FOR REALISING THAT THE SILLY DUCKS THOUGHT HIS WIFE A FOX INDEED AND WERE ALARMED ON THAT ACCOUNT
5513-39476-0042 HE FOUND PAINFUL THAT SPECTACLE WHICH TO OTHERS MIGHT HAVE BEEN AMUSING NOT SO HIS VIXEN WHO APPEARED IF ANYTHING MORE PLEASED THAN EVER WHEN SHE SAW IN WHAT A COMMOTION SHE HAD SET THEM AND BEGAN CUTTING A THOUSAND PRETTY CAPERS
5513-39476-0043 THOUGH AT FIRST HE CALLED TO HER TO COME BACK AND WALK ANOTHER WAY MISTER TEBRICK WAS OVERBORNE BY HER PLEASURE AND SAT DOWN
5513-39476-0044 DANCING ON HER HIND LEGS EVEN AND ROLLING ON THE GROUND THEN FELL TO RUNNING IN CIRCLES BUT ALL THIS WITHOUT PAYING ANY HEED TO THE DUCKS BUT THEY WITH THEIR NECKS CRANED OUT ALL POINTING ONE WAY SWAM TO AND FRO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE POND NEVER STOPPING THEIR QUACK
5513-39476-0045 QUACK QUACK AND KEEPING TIME TOO FOR THEY ALL QUACKED IN CHORUS PRESENTLY SHE CAME FURTHER AWAY FROM THE POND AND HE THINKING THEY HAD HAD ENOUGH OF THIS SORT OF ENTERTAINMENT LAID HOLD OF HER AND SAID TO HER
5513-39476-0046 COME SILVIA MY DEAR IT IS GROWING COLD AND IT IS TIME WE WENT INDOORS I AM SURE TAKING THE AIR HAS DONE YOU A WORLD OF GOOD BUT WE MUST NOT LINGER ANY MORE SHE APPEARED THEN TO AGREE WITH HIM
5513-39476-0047 THOUGH SHE THREW HALF A GLANCE OVER HER SHOULDER AT THE DUCKS AND THEY BOTH WALKED SOBERLY ENOUGH TOWARDS THE HOUSE WHEN THEY HAD GONE ABOUT HALFWAY SHE SUDDENLY SLIPPED ROUND AND WAS OFF HE TURNED QUICKLY AND SAW THE DUCKS HAD BEEN FOLLOWING THEM SO SHE DROVE THEM BEFORE HER BACK INTO THE POND
5513-39476-0048 THE DUCKS RUNNING IN TERROR FROM HER WITH THEIR WINGS SPREAD AND SHE NOT PRESSING THEM FOR HE SAW THAT HAD SHE BEEN SO MINDED SHE COULD HAVE CAUGHT TWO OR THREE OF THE NEAREST
5513-39476-0049 THEN WITH HER BRUSH WAVING ABOVE HER SHE CAME GAMBOLLING BACK TO HIM SO PLAYFULLY THAT HE STROKED HER INDULGENTLY THOUGH HE WAS FIRST VEXED AND THEN RATHER PUZZLED THAT HIS WIFE SHOULD AMUSE HERSELF WITH SUCH PRANKS
5513-39476-0050 BUT WHEN THEY GOT WITHIN DOORS HE PICKED HER UP IN HIS ARMS KISSED HER AND SPOKE TO HER SILVIA WHAT A LIGHT HEARTED CHILDISH CREATURE YOU ARE YOUR COURAGE UNDER MISFORTUNE SHALL BE A LESSON TO ME BUT I CANNOT
5513-39476-0051 I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE IT HERE THE TEARS STOOD SUDDENLY IN HIS EYES AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE OTTOMAN AND WEPT PAYING NO HEED TO HER UNTIL PRESENTLY HE WAS AROUSED BY HER LICKING HIS CHEEK AND HIS EAR
5513-39476-0052 AFTER TEA SHE LED HIM TO THE DRAWING ROOM AND SCRATCHED AT THE DOOR TILL HE OPENED IT FOR THIS WAS PART OF THE HOUSE WHICH HE HAD SHUT UP THINKING THREE OR FOUR ROOMS ENOUGH FOR THEM NOW AND TO SAVE THE DUSTING OF IT THEN IT SEEMED SHE WOULD HAVE HIM PLAY TO HER ON THE PIANOFORTE
5513-39476-0053 SHE LED HIM TO IT NAY WHAT IS MORE SHE WOULD HERSELF PICK OUT THE MUSIC HE WAS TO PLAY FIRST IT WAS A FUGUE OF HANDEL'S THEN ONE OF MENDELSSOHN'S SONGS WITHOUT WORDS AND THEN THE DIVER AND THEN MUSIC FROM GILBERT AND SULLIVAN
5513-39476-0054 BUT EACH PIECE OF MUSIC SHE PICKED OUT WAS GAYER THAN THE LAST ONE
