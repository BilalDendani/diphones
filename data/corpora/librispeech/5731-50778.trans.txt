5731-50778-0000 WHEN THE PIE WAS OPENED THE BIRDS BEGAN TO SING THE CHILDREN WENT OUT THE BACK DOOR QUIETLY AND WERE PRESENTLY LOST TO SIGHT SARAH MAUD SLIPPING AND STUMBLING ALONG ABSENT MINDEDLY AS SHE RECITED UNDER HER BREATH IT WAS SUCH A PLEASANT EVENIN'
5731-50778-0001 PETER RANG THE DOOR BELL AND PRESENTLY A SERVANT ADMITTED THEM AND WHISPERING SOMETHING IN SARAH'S EAR DREW HER DOWNSTAIRS INTO THE KITCHEN THE OTHER RUGGLESES STOOD IN HORROR STRICKEN GROUPS AS THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER
5731-50778-0002 BUT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR REFLECTION FOR A VOICE FROM ABOVE WAS HEARD SAYING COME RIGHT UP STAIRS PLEASE THEIRS NOT TO MAKE REPLY THEIRS NOT TO REASON WHY THEIRS BUT TO DO OR DIE
5731-50778-0003 ACCORDINGLY THEY WALKED UPSTAIRS AND ELFRIDA THE NURSE USHERED THEM INTO A ROOM MORE SPLENDID THAN ANYTHING THEY HAD EVER SEEN
5731-50778-0004 WHERE WAS SARAH MAUD AND WAS IT FATE THAT MISSUS BIRD SHOULD SAY AT ONCE DID YOU LAY YOUR HATS IN THE HALL PETER FELT HIMSELF ELECTED BY CIRCUMSTANCE THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY
5731-50778-0005 AND CASTING ONE IMPLORING LOOK AT TONGUE TIED SUSAN STANDING NEXT HIM SAID HUSKILY IT WAS SO VERY PLEASANT THAT THAT THAT WE HADN'T GOOD HATS ENOUGH TO GO ROUND PUT IN LITTLE SUSAN BRAVELY TO HELP HIM OUT
5731-50778-0006 NOW WILL YOU COME RIGHT IN TO MISS CAROL'S ROOM SHE IS SO ANXIOUS TO SEE YOU JUST THEN SARAH MAUD CAME UP THE BACK STAIRS SO RADIANT WITH JOY FROM HER SECRET INTERVIEW WITH THE COOK THAT PETER COULD HAVE PINCHED HER WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE
5731-50778-0007 WAS THIS A DINNER PARTY FORSOOTH AND IF SO WHY WERE SUCH THINGS EVER SPOKEN OF AS FESTIVE OCCASIONS SARAH MAUD WENT OUT THROUGH THE HALL CALLING LARRY LARRY
5731-50778-0008 HERE I BE THE TRUTH WAS THAT LARRY BEING DESERTED BY HIS NATURAL GUARDIAN DROPPED BEHIND THE REST AND WRIGGLED INTO THE HAT TREE TO WAIT FOR HER HAVING NO NOTION OF WALKING UNPROTECTED INTO THE JAWS OF A DINNER PARTY
5731-50778-0009 FINDING THAT SHE DID NOT COME HE TRIED TO CRAWL FROM HIS REFUGE AND CALL SOMEBODY WHEN DARK AND DREADFUL ENDING TO A TRAGIC DAY
5731-50778-0010 HE WAS AFRAID TO YELL WHEN I HAVE SAID THIS OF LARRY RUGGLES I HAVE PICTURED A STATE OF HELPLESS TERROR THAT OUGHT TO WRING TEARS FROM EVERY EYE AND THE SOUND OF SARAH MAUD'S BELOVED VOICE SOME SECONDS LATER WAS LIKE A STRAIN OF ANGEL MUSIC IN HIS EARS
5731-50778-0011 CAROL'S BED HAD BEEN MOVED INTO THE FARTHEST CORNER OF THE ROOM AND SHE WAS LYING ON THE OUTSIDE DRESSED IN A WONDERFUL SOFT WHITE WRAPPER HER GOLDEN HAIR FELL IN SOFT FLUFFY CURLS OVER HER WHITE FOREHEAD AND NECK HER CHEEKS FLUSHED DELICATELY
5731-50778-0012 HER EYES BEAMED WITH JOY AND THE CHILDREN TOLD THEIR MOTHER AFTERWARDS THAT SHE LOOKED AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE PICTURES OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN THERE WAS GREAT BUSTLE BEHIND A HUGE SCREEN IN ANOTHER PART OF THE ROOM AND AT HALF PAST FIVE THIS WAS TAKEN AWAY
5731-50778-0013 FOR HE STOOD NOT UPON THE ORDER OF HIS GOING BUT WENT AT ONCE FOR A HIGH CHAIR THAT POINTED UNMISTAKABLY TO HIM CLIMBED UP LIKE A SQUIRREL GAVE A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT THE TURKEY CLAPPED HIS HANDS IN ECSTACY
5731-50778-0014 RESTED HIS FAT ARMS ON THE TABLE AND CRIED WITH JOY I BEAT THE HULL LOT O YER CAROL LAUGHED UNTIL SHE CRIED GIVING ORDERS MEANWHILE UNCLE JACK PLEASE SIT AT THE HEAD SARAH MAUD AT THE FOOT
5731-50778-0015 AND HAVE IT PINNED ON BY CAROL AND AS EACH COURSE WAS SERVED ONE OF THEM PLEADED TO TAKE SOMETHING TO HER THERE WAS HURRYING TO AND FRO I CAN ASSURE YOU FOR IT IS QUITE A DIFFICULT MATTER TO SERVE A CHRISTMAS DINNER ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF A GREAT CITY HOUSE
5731-50778-0016 BUT IF EVERY DISH HAD HAD TO BE CARRIED UP A ROPE LADDER THE SERVANTS WOULD GLADLY HAVE DONE SO THERE WAS TURKEY AND CHICKEN WITH DELICIOUS GRAVY AND STUFFING AND THERE WERE HALF A DOZEN VEGETABLES WITH CRANBERRY JELLY AND CELERY AND PICKLES
5731-50778-0017 AND AS FOR THE WAY THESE DELICACIES WERE SERVED THE RUGGLESES NEVER FORGOT IT AS LONG AS THEY LIVED PETER NUDGED KITTY WHO SAT NEXT HIM AND SAID LOOK WILL YER EV'RY FELLER'S GOT HIS OWN PARTIC'LAR BUTTER I SUPPOSE THAT'S TO SHOW YER CAN EAT THAT MUCH N NO MORE

5731-50778-0020 NO ONE WAS ASKED BY UNCLE JACK WHETHER HE WOULD HAVE A SECOND HELPING BUT THE DISHES WERE QUIETLY PASSED UNDER THEIR NOSES AND NOT A SINGLE RUGGLES REFUSED ANYTHING THAT WAS OFFERED HIM EVEN UNTO THE SEVENTH TIME
5731-50778-0021 FOR A STRONG MAN IS NOTHING TO A SMALL BOY AND THEY KINDLED TO THE DESSERT AS IF THE TURKEY HAD BEEN A DREAM AND THE SIX VEGETABLES AN OPTICAL DELUSION
5731-50778-0022 MY DEAR CHILD WHISPERED UNCLE JACK AS HE TOOK CAROL AN ORANGE THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF THIS FEAST BUT I DO ADVISE YOU AFTER THIS TO HAVE THEM TWICE A YEAR OR QUARTERLY PERHAPS
5731-50778-0023 THE FEAST BEING OVER THE RUGGLESES LAY BACK IN THEIR CHAIRS LANGUIDLY AND THE TABLE WAS CLEARED IN A TRICE THEN A DOOR WAS OPENED INTO THE NEXT ROOM AND THERE IN A CORNER FACING CAROL'S BED WHICH HAD BEEN WHEELED AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE
