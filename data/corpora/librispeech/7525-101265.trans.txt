7525-101265-0000 SHE WAS SO UNHAPPY THAT SHE FELT AS IF THE WALLS WOULD STIFLE HER SO SHE WANDERED OUT INTO THE GARDEN AND THREW HERSELF DOWN ON A GRASSY BANK UNDER THE SHADE OF A LIME TREE
7525-101265-0001 THE QUEEN LOOKED AT HER DOUBTFULLY AND ANSWERED YOU DO NOT SEEM AS IF YOU HAD BEEN VERY LUCKY YOURSELF OR TO HAVE MUCH GOOD FORTUNE TO SPARE FOR ANYONE ELSE UNDER ROUGH BARK LIES SMOOTH WOOD AND SWEET KERNEL
7525-101265-0002 REPLIED THE OLD WOMAN LET ME SEE YOUR HAND THAT I MAY READ THE FUTURE THE QUEEN HELD OUT HER HAND AND THE OLD WOMAN EXAMINED ITS LINES CLOSELY THEN SHE SAID
7525-101265-0003 YOUR HEART IS HEAVY WITH TWO SORROWS ONE OLD AND ONE NEW THE NEW SORROW IS FOR YOUR HUSBAND WHO IS FIGHTING FAR AWAY FROM YOU BUT BELIEVE ME HE IS WELL AND WILL SOON BRING YOU JOYFUL NEWS
7525-101265-0004 BUT YOUR OTHER SORROW IS MUCH OLDER THAN THIS YOUR HAPPINESS IS SPOILT BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO CHILDREN AT THESE WORDS THE QUEEN BECAME SCARLET AND TRIED TO DRAW AWAY HER HAND BUT THE OLD WOMAN SAID
7525-101265-0005 BUT REJOICE THAT IT IS PERMITTED TO ME TO SHOW YOU A WAY TO LESSEN YOUR GRIEF YOU MUST HOWEVER PROMISE TO DO EXACTLY WHAT I TELL YOU IF ANY GOOD IS TO COME OF IT OH I WILL OBEY YOU EXACTLY CRIED THE QUEEN
7525-101265-0006 AND IF YOU CAN HELP ME YOU SHALL HAVE IN RETURN ANYTHING YOU ASK FOR THE OLD WOMAN STOOD THINKING FOR A LITTLE THEN SHE DREW SOMETHING FROM THE FOLDS OF HER DRESS AND UNDOING A NUMBER OF WRAPPINGS
7525-101265-0007 BROUGHT OUT A TINY BASKET MADE OF BIRCH BARK SHE HELD IT OUT TO THE QUEEN SAYING IN THE BASKET YOU WILL FIND A BIRD'S EGG THIS YOU MUST BE CAREFUL TO KEEP IN A WARM PLACE FOR THREE MONTHS WHEN IT WILL TURN INTO A DOLL
7525-101265-0008 LAY THE DOLL IN A BASKET LINED WITH SOFT WOOL AND LEAVE IT ALONE FOR IT WILL NOT NEED ANY FOOD AND BY AND BY YOU WILL FIND IT HAS GROWN TO BE THE SIZE OF A BABY THEN YOU WILL HAVE A BABY OF YOUR OWN
7525-101265-0009 AND YOU MUST PUT IT BY THE SIDE OF THE OTHER CHILD AND BRING YOUR HUSBAND TO SEE HIS SON AND DAUGHTER THE BOY YOU WILL BRING UP YOURSELF BUT YOU MUST ENTRUST THE LITTLE GIRL TO A NURSE
7525-101265-0010 YOU WILL INVITE ME TO BE GODMOTHER TO THE PRINCESS AND THIS IS HOW YOU MUST SEND THE INVITATION HIDDEN IN THE CRADLE YOU WILL FIND A GOOSE'S WING THROW THIS OUT OF THE WINDOW AND I WILL BE WITH YOU DIRECTLY
7525-101265-0011 THE QUEEN WAS ABOUT TO REPLY BUT THE OLD WOMAN WAS ALREADY LIMPING AWAY AND BEFORE SHE HAD GONE TWO STEPS SHE HAD TURNED INTO A YOUNG GIRL WHO MOVED SO QUICKLY THAT SHE SEEMED RATHER TO FLY THAN TO WALK
7525-101265-0012 THE QUEEN WATCHING THIS TRANSFORMATION COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HER EYES AND WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT ALL FOR A DREAM HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE BASKET WHICH SHE HELD IN HER HAND
7525-101265-0013 FEELING A DIFFERENT BEING FROM THE POOR SAD WOMAN WHO HAD WANDERED INTO THE GARDEN SO SHORT A TIME BEFORE SHE HASTENED TO HER ROOM AND FELT CAREFULLY IN THE BASKET FOR THE EGG THERE IT WAS A TINY THING OF SOFT BLUE WITH LITTLE GREEN SPOTS
7525-101265-0014 AND SHE TOOK IT OUT AND KEPT IT IN HER BOSOM WHICH WAS THE WARMEST PLACE SHE COULD THINK OF A FORTNIGHT AFTER THE OLD WOMAN HAD PAID HER VISIT THE KING CAME HOME HAVING CONQUERED HIS ENEMIES AT THIS PROOF THAT THE OLD WOMAN HAD SPOKEN TRUTH
7525-101265-0015 THE QUEEN'S HEART BOUNDED FOR SHE NOW HAD FRESH HOPES THAT THE REST OF THE PROPHECY MIGHT BE FULFILLED SHE CHERISHED THE BASKET AND THE EGG AS HER CHIEFEST TREASURES AND HAD A GOLDEN CASE MADE FOR THE BASKET
7525-101265-0016 SO THAT WHEN THE TIME CAME TO LAY THE EGG IN IT IT MIGHT NOT RISK ANY HARM THREE MONTHS PASSED AND AS THE OLD WOMAN HAD BIDDEN HER THE QUEEN TOOK THE EGG FROM HER BOSOM AND LAID IT SNUGLY AMIDST THE WARM WOOLLEN FOLDS
7525-101265-0017 THE NEXT MORNING SHE WENT TO LOOK AT IT AND THE FIRST THING SHE SAW WAS THE BROKEN EGGSHELL AND A LITTLE DOLL LYING AMONG THE PIECES THEN SHE FELT HAPPY AT LAST AND LEAVING THE DOLL IN PEACE TO GROW WAITED AS SHE HAD BEEN TOLD
7525-101265-0018 FOR A BABY OF HER OWN TO LAY BESIDE IT IN COURSE OF TIME THIS CAME ALSO AND THE QUEEN TOOK THE LITTLE GIRL OUT OF THE BASKET AND PLACED IT WITH HER SON IN A GOLDEN CRADLE WHICH GLITTERED WITH PRECIOUS STONES NEXT SHE SENT FOR THE KING
7525-101265-0019 WHO NEARLY WENT MAD WITH JOY AT THE SIGHT OF THE CHILDREN SOON THERE CAME A DAY WHEN THE WHOLE COURT WAS ORDERED TO BE PRESENT AT THE CHRISTENING OF THE ROYAL BABIES AND WHEN ALL WAS READY THE QUEEN SOFTLY OPENED THE WINDOW A LITTLE
7525-101265-0020 AND LET THE GOOSE WING FLY OUT THE GUESTS WERE COMING THICK AND FAST WHEN SUDDENLY THERE DROVE UP A SPLENDID COACH DRAWN BY SIX CREAM COLOURED HORSES AND OUT OF IT STEPPED A YOUNG LADY DRESSED IN GARMENTS THAT SHONE LIKE THE SUN
7525-101265-0021 HER FACE COULD NOT BE SEEN FOR A VEIL COVERED HER HEAD BUT AS SHE CAME UP TO THE PLACE WHERE THE QUEEN WAS STANDING WITH THE BABIES SHE DREW THE VEIL ASIDE AND EVERYONE WAS DAZZLED WITH HER BEAUTY
7525-101265-0022 SHE TOOK THE LITTLE GIRL IN HER ARMS AND HOLDING IT UP BEFORE THE ASSEMBLED COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT HENCEFORWARD IT WOULD BE KNOWN BY THE NAME OF DOTTERINE A NAME WHICH NO ONE UNDERSTOOD BUT THE QUEEN
7525-101265-0023 WHO KNEW THAT THE BABY HAD COME FROM THE YOLK OF AN EGG THE BOY WAS CALLED WILLEM AFTER THE FEAST WAS OVER AND THE GUESTS WERE GOING AWAY THE GODMOTHER LAID THE BABY IN THE CRADLE AND SAID TO THE QUEEN WHENEVER THE BABY GOES TO SLEEP
7525-101265-0024 AND LEAVE THE EGGSHELLS IN IT AS LONG AS YOU DO THAT NO EVIL CAN COME TO HER SO GUARD THIS TREASURE AS THE APPLE OF YOUR EYE AND TEACH YOUR DAUGHTER TO DO SO LIKEWISE THEN KISSING THE BABY THREE TIMES SHE MOUNTED HER COACH AND DROVE AWAY
7525-101265-0025 THE CHILDREN THROVE WELL AND DOTTERINE'S NURSE LOVED HER AS IF SHE WERE THE BABY'S REAL MOTHER EVERY DAY THE LITTLE GIRL SEEMED TO GROW PRETTIER AND PEOPLE USED TO SAY SHE WOULD SOON BE AS BEAUTIFUL AS HER GODMOTHER BUT NO ONE KNEW EXCEPT THE NURSE
7525-101265-0026 THAT AT NIGHT WHEN THE CHILD SLEPT A STRANGE AND LOVELY LADY BENT OVER HER AT LENGTH SHE TOLD THE QUEEN WHAT SHE HAD SEEN BUT THEY DETERMINED TO KEEP IT AS A SECRET BETWEEN THEMSELVES THE TWINS WERE BY THIS TIME NEARLY TWO YEARS OLD
7525-101265-0027 WHEN THE QUEEN WAS TAKEN SUDDENLY ILL ALL THE BEST DOCTORS IN THE COUNTRY WERE SENT FOR BUT IT WAS NO USE FOR THERE IS NO CURE FOR DEATH THE QUEEN KNEW SHE WAS DYING AND SENT FOR DOTTERINE AND HER NURSE WHO HAD NOW BECOME HER LADY IN WAITING
7525-101265-0028 TO HER AS HER MOST FAITHFUL SERVANT SHE GAVE THE LUCKY BASKET IN CHARGE AND BESOUGHT HER TO TREASURE IT CAREFULLY WHEN MY DAUGHTER SAID THE QUEEN IS TEN YEARS OLD YOU ARE TO HAND IT OVER TO HER BUT WARN HER SOLEMNLY
7525-101265-0029 THAT HER WHOLE FUTURE HAPPINESS DEPENDS ON THE WAY SHE GUARDS IT ABOUT MY SON I HAVE NO FEARS HE IS THE HEIR OF THE KINGDOM AND HIS FATHER WILL LOOK AFTER HIM THE LADY IN WAITING PROMISED TO CARRY OUT THE QUEEN'S DIRECTIONS
7525-101265-0030 AND ABOVE ALL TO KEEP THE AFFAIR A SECRET AND THAT SAME MORNING THE QUEEN DIED AFTER SOME YEARS THE KING MARRIED AGAIN BUT HE DID NOT LOVE HIS SECOND WIFE AS HE HAD DONE HIS FIRST AND HAD ONLY MARRIED HER FOR REASONS OF AMBITION
7525-101265-0031 SHE HATED HER STEP CHILDREN AND THE KING SEEING THIS KEPT THEM OUT OF THE WAY UNDER THE CARE OF DOTTERINE'S OLD NURSE BUT IF THEY EVER STRAYED ACROSS THE PATH OF THE QUEEN SHE WOULD KICK THEM OUT OF HER SIGHT LIKE DOGS
7525-101265-0032 ON DOTTERINE'S TENTH BIRTHDAY HER NURSE HANDED HER OVER THE CRADLE AND REPEATED TO HER HER MOTHER'S DYING WORDS BUT THE CHILD WAS TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF SUCH A GIFT AND AT FIRST THOUGHT LITTLE ABOUT IT TWO MORE YEARS SLIPPED BY
7525-101265-0033 WHEN ONE DAY DURING THE KING'S ABSENCE THE STEPMOTHER FOUND DOTTERINE SITTING UNDER A LIME TREE SHE FELL AS USUAL INTO A PASSION AND BEAT THE CHILD SO BADLY THAT DOTTERINE WENT STAGGERING TO HER OWN ROOM HER NURSE WAS NOT THERE
7525-101265-0034 BUT SUDDENLY AS SHE STOOD WEEPING HER EYES FELL UPON THE GOLDEN CASE IN WHICH LAY THE PRECIOUS BASKET SHE THOUGHT IT MIGHT CONTAIN SOMETHING TO AMUSE HER AND LOOKED EAGERLY INSIDE
7525-101265-0035 RUBBISH SAID THE CHILD TO HERSELF AND TURNING THREW THE WING OUT OF THE OPEN WINDOW IN A MOMENT A BEAUTIFUL LADY STOOD BESIDE HER DO NOT BE AFRAID SAID THE LADY STROKING DOTTERINE'S HEAD
7525-101265-0036 I AM YOUR GODMOTHER AND HAVE COME TO PAY YOU A VISIT YOUR RED EYES TELL ME THAT YOU ARE UNHAPPY I KNOW THAT YOUR STEPMOTHER IS VERY UNKIND TO YOU BUT BE BRAVE AND PATIENT AND BETTER DAYS WILL COME
7525-101265-0037 OR TO LOSE THE EGGSHELLS THAT ARE IN IT MAKE A SILKEN CASE FOR THE LITTLE BASKET AND HIDE IT AWAY IN YOUR DRESS NIGHT AND DAY AND YOU WILL BE SAFE FROM YOUR STEPMOTHER AND ANYONE THAT TRIES TO HARM YOU BUT
7525-101265-0038 IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO FIND YOURSELF IN ANY DIFFICULTY AND CANNOT TELL WHAT TO DO
7525-101265-0039 AND IN A MOMENT I WILL COME TO HELP YOU
7525-101265-0040 THEY HAD SO MUCH TO SAY TO EACH OTHER THAT THE SUN WAS ALREADY SETTING WHEN THE GODMOTHER HAD ENDED ALL THE GOOD ADVICE SHE WISHED TO GIVE THE CHILD
7525-101265-0041 SAID SHE FOR YOU MUST HAVE SOME SUPPER I CANNOT LET YOU GO HUNGRY TO BED THEN BENDING OVER THE BASKET SHE WHISPERED SOME MAGIC WORDS AND INSTANTLY A TABLE COVERED WITH FRUITS AND CAKES STOOD ON THE GROUND BEFORE THEM
7525-101265-0042 WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED EATING THE GODMOTHER LED THE CHILD BACK AND ON THE WAY TAUGHT HER THE WORDS SHE MUST SAY TO THE BASKET WHEN SHE WANTED IT TO GIVE HER SOMETHING IN A FEW YEARS MORE DOTTERINE WAS A GROWN UP YOUNG LADY
7525-101265-0043 IT LASTED SO LONG THAT FOOD BEGAN TO FAIL AND EVEN IN THE PALACE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH TO EAT SO ONE MORNING DOTTERINE WHO HAD HAD NEITHER SUPPER NOR BREAKFAST AND WAS FEELING VERY HUNGRY LET HER WING FLY AWAY
7525-101265-0044 SHE WAS SO WEAK AND MISERABLE THAT DIRECTLY HER GODMOTHER APPEARED SHE BURST INTO TEARS AND COULD NOT SPEAK FOR SOME TIME DO NOT CRY SO DEAR CHILD SAID THE GODMOTHER I WILL CARRY YOU AWAY FROM ALL THIS
7525-101265-0045 BUT THE OTHERS I MUST LEAVE TO TAKE THEIR CHANCE THEN BIDDING DOTTERINE FOLLOW HER SHE PASSED THROUGH THE GATES OF THE TOWN AND THROUGH THE ARMY OUTSIDE AND NOBODY STOPPED THEM OR SEEMED TO SEE THEM THE NEXT DAY THE TOWN SURRENDERED
7525-101265-0046 AND THE KING AND ALL HIS COURTIERS WERE TAKEN PRISONERS BUT IN THE CONFUSION HIS SON MANAGED TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE THE QUEEN HAD ALREADY MET HER DEATH FROM A SPEAR CARELESSLY THROWN AS SOON AS DOTTERINE AND HER GODMOTHER WERE CLEAR OF THE ENEMY
7525-101265-0047 DOTTERINE TOOK OFF HER OWN CLOTHES AND PUT ON THOSE OF A PEASANT AND IN ORDER TO DISGUISE HER BETTER HER GODMOTHER CHANGED HER FACE COMPLETELY WHEN BETTER TIMES COME HER PROTECTRESS SAID CHEERFULLY
7525-101265-0048 AND SAY YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR OWN FACE ONCE MORE AND IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT IN A MOMENT BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO ENDURE A LITTLE LONGER YET THEN WARNING HER ONCE MORE TO TAKE CARE OF THE BASKET THE LADY BADE THE GIRL FAREWELL
7525-101265-0049 FOR MANY DAYS DOTTERINE WANDERED FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER WITHOUT FINDING SHELTER AND THOUGH THE FOOD WHICH SHE GOT FROM THE BASKET PREVENTED HER FROM STARVING SHE WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO TAKE SERVICE IN A PEASANT'S HOUSE TILL BRIGHTER DAYS DAWNED
7525-101265-0050 AT FIRST THE WORK SHE HAD TO DO SEEMED VERY DIFFICULT BUT EITHER SHE WAS WONDERFULLY QUICK IN LEARNING OR ELSE THE BASKET MAY HAVE SECRETLY HELPED HER ANYHOW
7525-101265-0051 AT THE END OF THREE DAYS SHE COULD DO EVERYTHING AS WELL AS IF SHE HAD CLEANED POTS AND SWEPT ROOMS ALL HER LIFE ONE MORNING DOTTERINE WAS BUSY SCOURING A WOODEN TUB WHEN A NOBLE LADY HAPPENED TO PASS THROUGH THE VILLAGE
7525-101265-0052 AND SHE STOPPED AND CALLED THE GIRL TO COME AND SPEAK TO HER
7525-101265-0053 VERY MUCH REPLIED DOTTERINE IF MY PRESENT MISTRESS WILL ALLOW ME OH I WILL SETTLE THAT ANSWERED THE LADY AND SO SHE DID AND THE SAME DAY THEY SET OUT FOR THE LADY'S HOUSE DOTTERINE SITTING BESIDE THE COACHMAN
7525-101265-0054 SIX MONTHS WENT BY AND THEN CAME THE JOYFUL NEWS THAT THE KING'S SON HAD COLLECTED AN ARMY AND HAD DEFEATED THE USURPER WHO HAD TAKEN HIS FATHER'S PLACE BUT AT THE SAME MOMENT DOTTERINE LEARNED THAT THE OLD KING HAD DIED IN CAPTIVITY
7525-101265-0055 THE GIRL WEPT BITTERLY FOR HIS LOSS BUT IN SECRECY AS SHE HAD TOLD HER MISTRESS NOTHING ABOUT HER PAST LIFE AT THE END OF A YEAR OF MOURNING THE YOUNG KING LET IT BE KNOWN THAT HE INTENDED TO MARRY
7525-101265-0056 AND COMMANDED ALL THE MAIDENS IN THE KINGDOM TO COME TO A FEAST SO THAT HE MIGHT CHOOSE A WIFE FROM AMONG THEM FOR WEEKS ALL THE MOTHERS AND ALL THE DAUGHTERS IN THE LAND WERE BUSY PREPARING BEAUTIFUL DRESSES AND TRYING NEW WAYS OF PUTTING UP THEIR HAIR
7525-101265-0057 AND THE THREE LOVELY DAUGHTERS OF DOTTERINE'S MISTRESS WERE AS MUCH EXCITED AS THE REST THE GIRL WAS CLEVER WITH HER FINGERS AND WAS OCCUPIED ALL DAY WITH GETTING READY THEIR SMART CLOTHES BUT AT NIGHT
7525-101265-0058 WHEN SHE WENT TO BED SHE ALWAYS DREAMED THAT HER GODMOTHER BENT OVER HER AND SAID DRESS YOUR YOUNG LADIES FOR THE FEAST AND WHEN THEY HAVE STARTED FOLLOW THEM YOURSELF NOBODY WILL BE SO FINE AS YOU WHEN THE GREAT DAY CAME
7525-101265-0059 DOTTERINE COULD HARDLY CONTAIN HERSELF AND WHEN SHE HAD DRESSED HER YOUNG MISTRESSES AND SEEN THEM DEPART WITH THEIR MOTHER SHE FLUNG HERSELF ON HER BED AND BURST INTO TEARS
7525-101265-0060 LOOK IN YOUR BASKET AND YOU WILL FIND IN IT
7525-101265-0061 DOTTERINE DID NOT WANT TO BE TOLD TWICE UP SHE JUMPED SEIZED HER BASKET AND REPEATED THE MAGIC WORDS AND BEHOLD THERE LAY A DRESS ON THE BED SHINING AS A STAR SHE PUT IT ON WITH FINGERS THAT TREMBLED WITH JOY
7525-101265-0062 AND LOOKING IN THE GLASS WAS STRUCK DUMB AT HER OWN BEAUTY SHE WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND IN FRONT OF THE DOOR STOOD A FINE CARRIAGE INTO WHICH SHE STEPPED AND WAS DRIVEN AWAY LIKE THE WIND THE KING'S PALACE WAS A LONG WAY OFF
7525-101265-0063 YET IT SEEMED ONLY A FEW MINUTES BEFORE DOTTERINE DREW UP AT THE GREAT GATES SHE WAS JUST GOING TO ALIGHT WHEN SHE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED SHE HAD LEFT HER BASKET BEHIND HER WHAT WAS SHE TO DO GO BACK AND FETCH IT LEST SOME ILL FORTUNE SHOULD BEFALL HER
7525-101265-0064 OR ENTER THE PALACE AND TRUST TO CHANCE THAT NOTHING EVIL WOULD HAPPEN BUT BEFORE SHE COULD DECIDE A LITTLE SWALLOW FLEW UP WITH THE BASKET IN ITS BEAK AND THE GIRL WAS HAPPY AGAIN THE FEAST WAS ALREADY AT ITS HEIGHT
7525-101265-0065 AND THE HALL WAS BRILLIANT WITH YOUTH AND BEAUTY WHEN THE DOOR WAS FLUNG WIDE AND DOTTERINE ENTERED MAKING ALL THE OTHER MAIDENS LOOK PALE AND DIM BESIDE HER THEIR HOPES FADED AS THEY GAZED BUT THEIR MOTHERS WHISPERED TOGETHER SAYING
7525-101265-0066 SURELY THIS IS OUR LOST PRINCESS THE YOUNG KING DID NOT KNOW HER AGAIN BUT HE NEVER LEFT HER SIDE NOR TOOK HIS EYES FROM HER
7525-101265-0067 AND AT MIDNIGHT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED A THICK CLOUD SUDDENLY FILLED THE HALL SO THAT FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS DARK THEN THE MIST SUDDENLY GREW BRIGHT
7525-101265-0068 THIS SHE SAID TURNING TO THE KING IS THE GIRL WHOM YOU HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED TO BE YOUR SISTER AND WHO VANISHED DURING THE SIEGE SHE IS NOT YOUR SISTER AT ALL BUT THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF A NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY
7525-101265-0069 WHO WAS GIVEN TO YOUR MOTHER TO BRING UP TO SAVE HER FROM THE HANDS OF A WIZARD THEN SHE VANISHED AND WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN NOR THE WONDER WORKING BASKET EITHER
