128-134883-0000 MY DEAR SIR THE FACTS DETAILED IN MY LAST LETTER WILL SATISFY YOU AS TO THE MANNER IN WHICH THE INCREASE OF MASS IN AN ANIMAL THAT IS ITS GROWTH IS ACCOMPLISHED
128-134883-0001 THE FUNCTION PERFORMED IN THE ANIMAL SYSTEM BY SUBSTANCES DESTITUTE OF NITROGEN
128-134883-0002 THE GRAMINIVORA CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THESE SUBSTANCES THEIR FOOD MUST CONTAIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ONE OR MORE OF THEM AND IF THESE COMPOUNDS ARE NOT SUPPLIED DEATH QUICKLY ENSUES
128-134883-0003 THIS IMPORTANT INQUIRY EXTENDS ALSO TO THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE FOOD OF CARNIVOROUS ANIMALS IN THE EARLIEST PERIODS OF LIFE FOR THIS FOOD ALSO CONTAINS SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE NOT NECESSARY FOR THEIR SUPPORT IN THE ADULT STATE
128-134883-0004 THEIR DEVELOPMENT IS DEPENDENT ON THE SUPPLY OF A FLUID WHICH THE BODY OF THE MOTHER SECRETES IN THE SHAPE OF MILK MILK CONTAINS ONLY ONE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENT KNOWN UNDER THE NAME OF CASEINE BESIDES THIS ITS CHIEF INGREDIENTS ARE BUTTER
128-134883-0005 THE BLOOD OF THE YOUNG ANIMAL ITS MUSCULAR FIBRE CELLULAR TISSUE NERVOUS MATTER AND BONES MUST HAVE DERIVED THEIR ORIGIN FROM THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENT OF MILK THE CASEINE FOR BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK CONTAIN NO NITROGEN
128-134883-0006 NOW THE ANALYSIS OF CASEINE HAS LED TO THE RESULT WHICH AFTER THE DETAILS I HAVE GIVEN CAN HARDLY EXCITE YOUR SURPRISE THAT THIS SUBSTANCE ALSO IS IDENTICAL IN COMPOSITION WITH THE CHIEF CONSTITUENTS OF BLOOD FIBRINE AND ALBUMEN
128-134883-0007 NAY MORE A COMPARISON OF ITS PROPERTIES WITH THOSE OF VEGETABLE CASEINE HAS SHOWN THAT THESE TWO SUBSTANCES ARE IDENTICAL IN ALL THEIR PROPERTIES INSOMUCH THAT CERTAIN PLANTS SUCH AS PEAS BEANS AND LENTILS ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING THE SAME SUBSTANCE
128-134883-0008 WHICH IS FORMED FROM THE BLOOD OF THE MOTHER AND EMPLOYED IN YIELDING THE BLOOD OF THE YOUNG ANIMAL THE YOUNG ANIMAL THEREFORE RECEIVES IN THE FORM OF CASEINE
128-134883-0009 WHICH IS DISTINGUISHED FROM FIBRINE AND ALBUMEN BY ITS GREAT SOLUBILITY AND BY NOT COAGULATING WHEN HEATED THE CHIEF CONSTITUENT OF THE MOTHER'S BLOOD TO CONVERT CASEINE INTO BLOOD NO FOREIGN SUBSTANCE IS REQUIRED AND IN THE CONVERSION OF THE MOTHER'S BLOOD INTO CASEINE
128-134883-0010 WHEN CHEMICALLY EXAMINED CASEINE IS FOUND TO CONTAIN A MUCH LARGER PROPORTION OF THE EARTH OF BONES THAN BLOOD DOES AND THAT IN A VERY SOLUBLE FORM CAPABLE OF REACHING EVERY PART OF THE BODY THUS EVEN IN THE EARLIEST PERIOD OF ITS LIFE
128-134883-0011 THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANS IN WHICH VITALITY RESIDES IS IN THE CARNIVOROUS ANIMAL DEPENDENT ON THE SUPPLY OF A SUBSTANCE
128-134883-0012 WHAT THEN IS THE USE OF THE BUTTER AND THE SUGAR OF MILK HOW DOES IT HAPPEN THAT THESE SUBSTANCES ARE INDISPENSABLE TO LIFE BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK CONTAIN NO FIXED BASES NO SODA NOR POTASH
128-134883-0013 SUGAR OF MILK HAS A COMPOSITION CLOSELY ALLIED TO THAT OF THE OTHER KINDS OF SUGAR OF STARCH AND OF GUM ALL OF THEM CONTAIN CARBON AND THE ELEMENTS OF WATER THE LATTER PRECISELY IN THE PROPORTION TO FORM WATER
128-134883-0014 THERE IS ADDED THEREFORE BY MEANS OF THESE COMPOUNDS TO THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENTS OF FOOD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CARBON OR AS IN THE CASE OF BUTTER OF CARBON AND HYDROGEN THAT IS AN EXCESS OF ELEMENTS
128-134883-0015 WHICH CANNOT POSSIBLY BE EMPLOYED IN THE PRODUCTION OF BLOOD
128-134883-0016 ALREADY CONTAIN EXACTLY THE AMOUNT OF CARBON WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FIBRINE AND ALBUMEN
128-134883-0017 WHICH NEITHER GAINS NOR LOSES WEIGHT PERCEPTIBLY FROM DAY TO DAY ITS NOURISHMENT THE WASTE OF ORGANISED TISSUE AND ITS CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN STAND TO EACH OTHER IN A WELL DEFINED AND FIXED RELATION THE CARBON OF THE CARBONIC ACID GIVEN OFF WITH THAT OF THE URINE
128-134883-0018 THE NITROGEN OF THE URINE AND THE HYDROGEN GIVEN OFF AS AMMONIA AND WATER THESE ELEMENTS TAKEN TOGETHER MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL IN WEIGHT TO THE CARBON NITROGEN AND HYDROGEN OF THE METAMORPHOSED TISSUES
128-134883-0019 AND SINCE THESE LAST ARE EXACTLY REPLACED BY THE FOOD TO THE CARBON NITROGEN AND HYDROGEN OF THE FOOD WERE THIS NOT THE CASE THE WEIGHT OF THE ANIMAL COULD NOT POSSIBLY REMAIN UNCHANGED
128-134883-0020 THIS FACT PRESUPPOSES
128-134883-0021 MORE INTENSE THAN THE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION IN THE EXISTING TISSUES IF BOTH PROCESSES WERE EQUALLY ACTIVE THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY COULD NOT INCREASE AND WERE THE WASTE BY TRANSFORMATION GREATER THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY WOULD DECREASE
128-134883-0022 NOW THE CIRCULATION IN THE YOUNG ANIMAL IS NOT WEAKER BUT ON THE CONTRARY MORE RAPID THE RESPIRATIONS ARE MORE FREQUENT AND FOR EQUAL BULKS THE CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN MUST BE GREATER RATHER THAN SMALLER IN THE YOUNG THAN IN THE ADULT ANIMAL
128-134883-0023 BUT SINCE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF ORGANISED PARTS GOES ON MORE SLOWLY THERE WOULD ENSUE A DEFICIENCY OF THOSE SUBSTANCES
128-134883-0024 BECAUSE IN THE CARNIVORA NATURE HAS DESTINED THE NEW COMPOUNDS PRODUCED BY THE METAMORPHOSIS OF ORGANISED PARTS TO FURNISH THE NECESSARY RESISTANCE TO THE ACTION OF THE OXYGEN AND TO PRODUCE ANIMAL HEAT
128-134883-0025 NO PART OF EITHER OF WHICH CAN YIELD BLOOD FIBRINE OR ALBUMEN ARE DESTINED FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS AT AN AGE WHEN A GREATER RESISTANCE IS OPPOSED TO THE METAMORPHOSIS OF EXISTING ORGANISMS OR IN OTHER WORDS TO THE PRODUCTION OF COMPOUNDS WHICH
128-134883-0026 IN THE ADULT STATE ARE PRODUCED IN QUANTITY AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESPIRATION THE YOUNG ANIMAL RECEIVES THE CONSTITUENTS OF ITS BLOOD IN THE CASEINE OF THE MILK A METAMORPHOSIS OF EXISTING ORGANS GOES ON FOR BILE AND URINE ARE SECRETED
128-134883-0027 THE MATERIALS OF THE METAMORPHOSED PARTS ARE GIVEN OFF IN THE FORM OF URINE OF CARBONIC ACID AND OF WATER BUT THE BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK ALSO DISAPPEAR THEY CANNOT BE DETECTED IN THE FAECES THE BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK ARE GIVEN OUT IN THE FORM OF CARBONIC ACID AND WATER
128-134883-0028 AND THEIR CONVERSION INTO OXIDISED PRODUCTS FURNISHES THE CLEAREST PROOF THAT FAR MORE OXYGEN IS ABSORBED THAN IS REQUIRED TO CONVERT THE CARBON AND HYDROGEN OF THE METAMORPHOSED TISSUES INTO CARBONIC ACID AND WATER
128-134883-0029 MUCH LESS CARBON AND HYDROGEN IN THE FORM ADAPTED FOR THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS THAN CORRESPOND TO THE OXYGEN TAKEN UP IN THE LUNGS
128-134883-0030 AND WOULD NECESSARILY YIELD TO THE ACTION OF THE OXYGEN WERE NOT THE DEFICIENCY OF CARBON AND HYDROGEN SUPPLIED FROM ANOTHER SOURCE THE CONTINUED INCREASE OF MASS OR GROWTH
128-134883-0031 AND THE FREE AND UNIMPEDED DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANS IN THE YOUNG ANIMAL ARE DEPENDENT ON THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN SUBSTANCES WHICH IN THE NUTRITIVE PROCESS HAVE NO OTHER FUNCTION THAN TO PROTECT THE NEWLY FORMED ORGANS FROM THE ACTION OF THE OXYGEN
128-134883-0032 THE ELEMENTS OF THESE SUBSTANCES UNITE WITH THE OXYGEN THE ORGANS THEMSELVES COULD NOT DO SO WITHOUT BEING CONSUMED THAT IS GROWTH OR INCREASE OF MASS IN THE BODY THE CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN REMAINING THE SAME WOULD BE UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE
128-134883-0033 THE PRECEDING CONSIDERATIONS LEAVE NO DOUBT AS TO THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH NATURE HAS ADDED TO THE FOOD OF THE YOUNG OF CARNIVOROUS MAMMALIA SUBSTANCES DEVOID OF NITROGEN
128-134883-0034 WHICH THEIR ORGANISM CANNOT EMPLOY FOR NUTRITION STRICTLY SO CALLED THAT IS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BLOOD SUBSTANCES WHICH MAY BE ENTIRELY DISPENSED WITH IN THEIR NOURISHMENT IN THE ADULT STATE
128-134883-0035 IN THE YOUNG OF CARNIVOROUS BIRDS THE WANT OF ALL MOTION IS AN OBVIOUS CAUSE OF DIMINISHED WASTE IN THE ORGANISED PARTS HENCE MILK IS NOT PROVIDED FOR THEM THE NUTRITIVE PROCESS IN THE CARNIVORA THUS PRESENTS ITSELF UNDER TWO DISTINCT FORMS
128-134883-0036 THEIR EXISTENCE DEPENDS ON A SUPPLY OF SUBSTANCES HAVING A COMPOSITION IDENTICAL WITH THAT OF SUGAR OF MILK OR CLOSELY RESEMBLING IT EVERYTHING THAT THEY CONSUME AS FOOD CONTAINS A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF STARCH GUM OR SUGAR MIXED WITH OTHER MATTERS
128-134883-0037 THE FUNCTION PERFORMED IN THE VITAL PROCESS OF THE GRAMINIVORA BY THESE SUBSTANCES IS INDICATED IN A VERY CLEAR AND CONVINCING MANNER WHEN WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE VERY SMALL RELATIVE AMOUNT OF THE CARBON
128-134883-0038 WHICH THESE ANIMALS CONSUME IN THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENTS OF THEIR FOOD WHICH BEARS NO PROPORTION WHATEVER TO THE OXYGEN ABSORBED THROUGH THE SKIN AND LUNGS A HORSE FOR EXAMPLE
128-134883-0039 IF WE NOW CALCULATE
128-134883-0040 BUT ALONG WITH THIS NITROGEN
128-134883-0041 WITHOUT GOING FURTHER INTO THE CALCULATION IT WILL READILY BE ADMITTED
128-134883-0042 THE QUANTITY OF OXYGEN CONSUMED AND AS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE THE AMOUNT OF CARBONIC ACID GIVEN OUT BY THE ANIMAL ARE MUCH GREATER THAN IN THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS IN MAN BUT AN ADULT MAN CONSUMES DAILY ABUT FOURTEEN OZ OF CARBON
128-134883-0043 ACCORDING TO WHICH A HORSE EXPIRES SEVENTY NINE OZ DAILY CANNOT BE VERY FAR FROM THE TRUTH
128-134883-0044 THE HORSE RECEIVES RATHER LESS THAN THE FIFTH PART OF THE CARBON WHICH HIS ORGANISM REQUIRES FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS AND WE SEE THAT THE WISDOM OF THE CREATOR HAS ADDED TO HIS FOOD THE FOUR FIFTHS WHICH ARE WANTING
128-134883-0045 IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IN THE SYSTEM OF THE GRAMINIVORA WHOSE FOOD CONTAINS SO SMALL A PORTION RELATIVELY OF THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE BLOOD THE PROCESS OF METAMORPHOSIS IN EXISTING TISSUES AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR RESTORATION OR REPRODUCTION
128-134883-0046 MUST GO ON FAR LESS RAPIDLY THAN IN THE CARNIVORA WERE THIS NOT THE CASE A VEGETATION A THOUSAND TIMES MORE LUXURIANT THAN THE ACTUAL ONE WOULD NOT SUFFICE FOR THEIR NOURISHMENT SUGAR GUM AND STARCH WOULD NO LONGER BE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT LIFE IN THESE ANIMALS
128-134883-0047 BECAUSE IN THAT CASE THE PRODUCTS OF THE WASTE OR METAMORPHOSIS OF THE ORGANISED TISSUES
