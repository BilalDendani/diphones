5261-19373-0000 THE DISCOVERY OF NEPTUNE WE APPROACH TO NIGHT PERHAPS THE GREATEST CERTAINLY THE MOST CONSPICUOUS TRIUMPHS OF THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION THE EXPLANATION BY NEWTON OF THE OBSERVED FACTS OF THE MOTION OF THE MOON
5261-19373-0001 THE WAY HE ACCOUNTED FOR PRECESSION AND NUTATION AND FOR THE TIDES THE WAY IN WHICH LAPLACE EXPLAINED EVERY DETAIL OF THE PLANETARY MOTIONS THESE ACHIEVEMENTS MAY SEEM TO THE PROFESSIONAL ASTRONOMER EQUALLY IF NOT MORE STRIKING AND WONDERFUL
5261-19373-0002 BUT OF THE FACTS TO BE EXPLAINED IN THESE CASES THE GENERAL PUBLIC ARE NECESSARILY MORE OR LESS IGNORANT AND SO NO BEAUTY OR THOROUGHNESS OF TREATMENT APPEALS TO THEM NOR CAN EXCITE THEIR IMAGINATIONS BUT TO PREDICT IN THE SOLITUDE OF THE STUDY
5261-19373-0003 WITH NO WEAPONS OTHER THAN PEN INK AND PAPER AN UNKNOWN AND ENORMOUSLY DISTANT WORLD TO CALCULATE ITS ORBIT WHEN AS YET IT HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN AND TO BE ABLE TO SAY TO A PRACTICAL ASTRONOMER
5261-19373-0004 POINT YOUR TELESCOPE IN SUCH A DIRECTION AT SUCH A TIME AND YOU WILL SEE A NEW PLANET HITHERTO UNKNOWN TO MAN THIS MUST ALWAYS APPEAL TO THE IMAGINATION WITH DRAMATIC INTENSITY
5261-19373-0005 PREDICTION IS NO NOVELTY IN SCIENCE AND IN ASTRONOMY LEAST OF ALL IS IT A NOVELTY
5261-19373-0006 COULD PREDICT ECLIPSES WITH SOME CERTAINTY THOUGH WITH ONLY ROUGH ACCURACY AND MANY OTHER PHENOMENA WERE CAPABLE OF PREDICTION BY ACCUMULATED EXPERIENCE WE HAVE SEEN FOR INSTANCE COMING TO LATER TIMES
5261-19373-0007 HOW A GAP BETWEEN MARS AND JUPITER CAUSED A MISSING PLANET TO BE SUSPECTED AND LOOKED FOR AND TO BE FOUND IN A HUNDRED PIECES WE HAVE SEEN ALSO HOW THE ABNORMAL PROPER MOTION OF SIRIUS SUGGESTED TO BESSEL THE EXISTENCE OF AN UNSEEN COMPANION
5261-19373-0008 AS THAT OF THE DISCOVERY OF NEPTUNE WHEREIN THEN LIES THE DIFFERENCE HOW COMES IT THAT SOME CLASSES OF PREDICTION
5261-19373-0009 ARE CHILDISHLY EASY AND COMMONPLACE WHILE OTHERS EXCITE IN THE KEENEST INTELLECTS THE HIGHEST FEELINGS OF ADMIRATION MAINLY THE DIFFERENCE LIES FIRST IN THE GROUNDS ON WHICH THE PREDICTION IS BASED SECOND ON THE DIFFICULTY OF THE INVESTIGATION WHEREBY IT IS ACCOMPLISHED
5261-19373-0010 THIRD IN THE COMPLETENESS AND THE ACCURACY WITH WHICH IT CAN BE VERIFIED IN ALL THESE POINTS THE DISCOVERY OF NEPTUNE STANDS OUT PRE EMINENTLY AMONG THE VERIFIED PREDICTIONS OF SCIENCE AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING IT ARE OF SINGULAR INTEREST
5261-19373-0011 IT HAD BEEN THOUGHT OF COURSE TO BE A STAR FOR IT SHINES LIKE A STAR OF THE SIXTH MAGNITUDE AND CAN THEREFORE BE JUST SEEN WITHOUT A TELESCOPE IF ONE KNOWS PRECISELY WHERE TO LOOK FOR IT AND IF ONE HAS GOOD SIGHT BUT IF IT HAD BEEN SEEN AND CATALOGUED AS A STAR
5261-19373-0012 AND THE CATALOGUE WOULD BY THAT ENTRY BE WRONG THE THING TO DETECT THEREFORE WAS ERRORS IN THE CATALOGUES TO EXAMINE ALL ENTRIES AND SEE IF THE STARS ENTERED ACTUALLY EXISTED OR WERE ANY OF THEM MISSING IF A WRONG ENTRY WERE DISCOVERED
5261-19373-0013 AND SEE IF BY ANY POSSIBILITY THE PLANET COULD HAVE BEEN IN THAT PLACE AT THAT TIME EXAMINED IN THIS WAY THE TABULATED OBSERVATIONS OF FLAMSTEED SHOWED THAT HE HAD UNWITTINGLY OBSERVED URANUS FIVE DISTINCT TIMES THE FIRST TIME IN SIXTEEN NINETY
5261-19373-0014 NEARLY A CENTURY BEFORE HERSCHEL DISCOVERED ITS TRUE NATURE BUT MORE REMARKABLE STILL LE MONNIER OF PARIS HAD OBSERVED IT EIGHT TIMES IN ONE MONTH CATALOGUING IT EACH TIME AS A DIFFERENT STAR
5261-19373-0015 IF ONLY HE HAD REDUCED AND COMPARED HIS OBSERVATIONS HE WOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED HERSCHEL BY TWELVE YEARS AS IT WAS HE MISSED IT ALTOGETHER IT WAS SEEN ONCE BY BRADLEY ALSO ALTOGETHER IT HAD BEEN SEEN TWENTY TIMES
5261-19373-0016 THESE OLD OBSERVATIONS OF FLAMSTEED AND THOSE OF LE MONNIER COMBINED WITH THOSE MADE AFTER HERSCHEL'S DISCOVERY WERE VERY USEFUL IN DETERMINING AN EXACT ORBIT FOR THE NEW PLANET AND ITS MOTION WAS CONSIDERED THOROUGHLY KNOWN
5261-19373-0017 IT WAS NOT AN EXACT ELLIPSE OF COURSE NONE OF THE PLANETS DESCRIBE EXACT ELLIPSES EACH PERTURBS ALL THE REST AND THESE SMALL PERTURBATIONS MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THOSE OF JUPITER AND SATURN BEING BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT
5261-19373-0018 FOR A TIME URANUS SEEMED TO TRAVEL REGULARLY AND AS EXPECTED IN THE ORBIT WHICH HAD BEEN CALCULATED FOR IT BUT EARLY IN THE PRESENT CENTURY IT BEGAN TO BE SLIGHTLY REFRACTORY
5261-19373-0019 THERE WAS AN UNMISTAKABLE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THEORY AND OBSERVATION SOME CAUSE WAS EVIDENTLY AT WORK ON THIS DISTANT PLANET CAUSING IT TO DISAGREE WITH ITS MOTION AS CALCULATED ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF GRAVITATION
5261-19373-0020 SOME THOUGHT THAT THE EXACT LAW OF GRAVITATION DID NOT APPLY TO SO DISTANT A BODY OTHERS SURMISED THE PRESENCE OF SOME FOREIGN AND UNKNOWN BODY SOME COMET OR SOME STILL MORE DISTANT PLANET PERHAPS WHOSE GRAVITATIVE ATTRACTION FOR URANUS WAS THE CAUSE OF THE WHOLE DIFFICULTY
5261-19373-0021 SOME PERTURBATIONS IN FACT WHICH HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BECAUSE OF OUR IGNORANCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE BODY WHICH CAUSED THEM BUT THOUGH SUCH AN IDEA WAS MENTIONED AMONG ASTRONOMERS IT WAS NOT REGARDED WITH ANY SPECIAL FAVOUR
5261-19373-0022 AND WAS CONSIDERED MERELY AS ONE AMONG A NUMBER OF HYPOTHESES WHICH COULD BE SUGGESTED AS FAIRLY PROBABLE IT IS PERFECTLY RIGHT NOT TO ATTACH MUCH IMPORTANCE TO UNELABORATED GUESSES NOT UNTIL THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN HYPOTHESIS HAVE BEEN LABORIOUSLY WORKED OUT
5261-19373-0023 A LATER STAGE STILL OCCURS WHEN THE THEORY HAS BEEN ACTUALLY AND COMPLETELY VERIFIED BY AGREEMENT WITH OBSERVATION
5261-19373-0024 PLUS SIXTY ONE POINT TWO
5261-19373-0025 SEVENTEEN TWELVE PLUS NINETY TWO POINT SEVEN
5261-19373-0026 SEVENTEEN FIFTEEN PLUS SEVENTY THREE POINT EIGHT LE MONNIER SEVENTEEN FIFTY MINUS FORTY SEVEN POINT SIX BRADLEY SEVENTEEN FIFTY THREE MINUS THIRTY NINE POINT FIVE
5261-19373-0027 SEVENTEEN FIFTY SIX MINUS FORTY FIVE POINT SEVEN LE MONNIER SEVENTEEN SIXTY FOUR MINUS THIRTY FOUR POINT NINE
5261-19373-0028 SEVENTEEN SIXTY NINE MINUS NINETEEN POINT THREE
5261-19373-0029 PLUS TWELVE POINT THREE SIX SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE PLUS NINETEEN POINT ZERO TWO EIGHTEEN O ONE PLUS TWENTY TWO POINT TWO ONE EIGHTEEN TEN PLUS TWENTY THREE POINT ONE SIX
5261-19373-0030 EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO PLUS TWENTY POINT NINE SEVEN EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE PLUS EIGHTEEN POINT ONE SIX EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT PLUS TEN POINT EIGHT TWO EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE MINUS THREE POINT NINE EIGHT
5261-19373-0031 EIGHTEEN THIRTY FOUR MINUS TWENTY POINT EIGHT ZERO EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN MINUS FORTY TWO POINT SIX SIX EIGHTEEN FORTY MINUS SIXTY SIX POINT SIX FOUR THESE ARE THE NUMBERS PLOTTED IN THE ABOVE DIAGRAM
5261-19373-0032 SOMETHING WAS EVIDENTLY THE MATTER WITH THE PLANET IF THE LAW OF GRAVITATION HELD EXACTLY AT SO GREAT A DISTANCE FROM THE SUN THERE MUST BE SOME PERTURBING FORCE ACTING ON IT BESIDES ALL THOSE KNOWN ONES
5261-19373-0033 THE ORDINARY PROBLEM OF PERTURBATION IS DIFFICULT ENOUGH GIVEN A DISTURBING PLANET IN SUCH AND SUCH A POSITION TO FIND THE PERTURBATIONS IT PRODUCES THIS PROBLEM IT WAS THAT LAPLACE WORKED OUT IN THE MECANIQUE CELESTE BUT THE INVERSE PROBLEM
5261-19373-0034 GIVEN THE PERTURBATIONS TO FIND THE PLANET WHICH CAUSES THEM SUCH A PROBLEM HAD NEVER YET BEEN ATTACKED AND BY ONLY A FEW HAD ITS POSSIBILITY BEEN CONCEIVED BESSEL MADE PREPARATIONS FOR TRYING WHAT HE COULD DO AT IT IN EIGHTEEN FORTY
5261-19373-0035 BUT HE WAS PREVENTED BY FATAL ILLNESS IN EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE PROBLEM PRESENTED BY THESE RESIDUAL PERTURBATIONS OF URANUS EXCITED THE IMAGINATION OF A YOUNG STUDENT AN UNDERGRADUATE OF SAINT JOHN'S COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE JOHN COUCH ADAMS BY NAME
5261-19373-0036 AND HE DETERMINED TO HAVE A TRY AT IT AS SOON AS HE WAS THROUGH HIS TRIPOS IN JANUARY EIGHTEEN FORTY THREE HE GRADUATED AS SENIOR WRANGLER AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS HE SET TO WORK IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS HE REACHED A DEFINITE CONCLUSION
5261-19373-0037 AND IN OCTOBER EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE HE WROTE TO THE ASTRONOMER ROYAL AT GREENWICH PROFESSOR AIRY SAYING THAT THE PERTURBATIONS OF URANUS WOULD BE EXPLAINED BY ASSUMING THE EXISTENCE OF AN OUTER PLANET WHICH HE RECKONED WAS NOW SITUATED IN A SPECIFIED LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE
5261-19373-0038 AND OUT OF THIS MASS OF RUBBISH IT REQUIRES GREAT SKILL AND PATIENCE TO DETECT SUCH GEMS OF VALUE AS THERE MAY BE NOW THIS LETTER OF MISTER ADAMS'S WAS INDEED A JEWEL OF THE FIRST WATER AND NO DOUBT BORE ON ITS FACE A VERY DIFFERENT APPEARANCE FROM THE CHAFF OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN
5261-19373-0039 BUT STILL MISTER ADAMS WAS AN UNKNOWN MAN HE HAD GRADUATED AS SENIOR WRANGLER IT IS TRUE BUT SOMEBODY MUST GRADUATE AS SENIOR WRANGLER EVERY YEAR AND EVERY YEAR BY NO MEANS PRODUCES A FIRST RATE MATHEMATICIAN
5261-19373-0040 THOSE BEHIND THE SCENES AS PROFESSOR AIRY OF COURSE WAS HAVING BEEN A SENIOR WRANGLER HIMSELF KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT THE LABELLING OF A YOUNG MAN ON TAKING HIS DEGREE IS MUCH MORE WORTHLESS AS A TESTIMONY TO HIS GENIUS AND ABILITY THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC ARE APT TO SUPPOSE
5261-19373-0041 WAS IT LIKELY THAT A YOUNG AND UNKNOWN MAN SHOULD HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SOLVED SO EXTREMELY DIFFICULT A PROBLEM IT WAS ALTOGETHER UNLIKELY STILL HE WOULD TEST HIM
5261-19373-0042 HE WOULD ASK FOR FURTHER EXPLANATIONS CONCERNING SOME OF THE PERTURBATIONS WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD SPECIALLY NOTICED AND SEE IF MISTER ADAMS COULD EXPLAIN THESE ALSO BY HIS HYPOTHESIS IF HE COULD THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING IN HIS THEORY IF HE FAILED WELL THERE WAS AN END OF IT
5261-19373-0043 THE QUESTIONS WERE NOT DIFFICULT THEY CONCERNED THE ERROR OF THE RADIUS VECTOR MISTER ADAMS COULD HAVE ANSWERED THEM WITH PERFECT EASE BUT SAD TO SAY
5261-19373-0044 HE WAS NOT A MAN OF BUSINESS HE DID NOT ANSWER PROFESSOR AIRY'S LETTER
5261-19373-0045 BUT IT IS NO LIGHT MATTER TO DERANGE THE WORK OF AN OBSERVATORY AND ALTER THE WORK MAPPED OUT FOR THE STAFF INTO A SUDDEN SWEEP FOR A NEW PLANET ON THE STRENGTH OF A MATHEMATICAL INVESTIGATION JUST RECEIVED BY POST
5261-19373-0046 IF OBSERVATORIES WERE CONDUCTED ON THESE UNSYSTEMATIC AND SPASMODIC PRINCIPLES THEY WOULD NOT BE THE CALM ACCURATE SATISFACTORY PLACES THEY ARE OF COURSE IF ANY ONE COULD HAVE KNOWN THAT A NEW PLANET WAS TO BE HAD FOR THE LOOKING ANY COURSE WOULD HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED
5261-19373-0047 BUT NO ONE COULD KNOW THIS I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT MISTER ADAMS HIMSELF COULD FEEL ALL THAT CONFIDENCE IN HIS ATTEMPTED PREDICTION SO THERE THE MATTER DROPPED MISTER ADAMS'S COMMUNICATION WAS PIGEON HOLED AND REMAINED IN SECLUSION FOR EIGHT OR NINE MONTHS
5261-19373-0048 MEANWHILE AND QUITE INDEPENDENTLY SOMETHING OF THE SAME SORT WAS GOING ON IN FRANCE A BRILLIANT YOUNG MATHEMATICIAN BORN IN NORMANDY IN EIGHTEEN ELEVEN HAD ACCEPTED THE POST OF ASTRONOMICAL PROFESSOR AT THE ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE THEN RECENTLY FOUNDED BY NAPOLEON
5261-19373-0049 HIS FIRST PUBLISHED PAPERS DIRECTED ATTENTION TO HIS WONDERFUL POWERS AND THE OFFICIAL HEAD OF ASTRONOMY IN FRANCE THE FAMOUS ARAGO SUGGESTED TO HIM THE UNEXPLAINED PERTURBATIONS OF URANUS AS A WORTHY OBJECT FOR HIS FRESH AND WELL ARMED VIGOUR
5261-19373-0050 AT ONCE HE SET TO WORK IN A THOROUGH AND SYSTEMATIC WAY HE FIRST CONSIDERED WHETHER THE DISCREPANCIES COULD BE DUE TO ERRORS IN THE TABLES OR ERRORS IN THE OLD OBSERVATIONS HE DISCUSSED THEM WITH MINUTE CARE AND CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY WERE NOT THUS TO BE EXPLAINED AWAY
5261-19373-0051 THIS PART OF THE WORK HE PUBLISHED IN NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE HE THEN SET TO WORK TO CONSIDER THE PERTURBATIONS PRODUCED BY JUPITER AND SATURN TO SEE IF THEY HAD BEEN WITH PERFECT ACCURACY ALLOWED FOR OR WHETHER SOME MINUTE IMPROVEMENTS COULD BE MADE SUFFICIENT TO DESTROY THE IRREGULARITIES
5261-19373-0052 HE INTRODUCED SEVERAL FRESH TERMS INTO THESE PERTURBATIONS BUT NONE OF THEM OF SUFFICIENT MAGNITUDE TO DO MORE THAN SLIGHTLY LESSEN THE UNEXPLAINED PERTURBATIONS HE NEXT EXAMINED THE VARIOUS HYPOTHESES THAT HAD BEEN SUGGESTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THEM
5261-19373-0053 OR WAS IT DUE TO A COLLISION WITH SOME COMET ALL THESE HE EXAMINED AND DISMISSED FOR VARIOUS REASONS ONE AFTER THE OTHER IT WAS DUE TO SOME STEADY CONTINUOUS CAUSE FOR INSTANCE SOME UNKNOWN PLANET
5261-19373-0054 SO STRIKING A COINCIDENCE SEEMED SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY A HERSCHELIAN SWEEP FOR A WEEK OR TWO BUT A SWEEP FOR SO DISTANT A PLANET WOULD BE NO EASY MATTER
5261-19373-0055 WHEN SEEN IN A LARGE TELESCOPE IT WOULD STILL ONLY LOOK LIKE A STAR AND IT WOULD REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE LABOUR AND WATCHING TO SIFT IT OUT FROM THE OTHER STARS SURROUNDING IT WE KNOW THAT URANUS HAD BEEN SEEN TWENTY TIMES AND THOUGHT TO BE A STAR BEFORE ITS TRUE NATURE WAS BY HERSCHEL DISCOVERED
5261-19373-0056 AND URANUS IS ONLY ABOUT HALF AS FAR AWAY AS NEPTUNE IS NEITHER IN PARIS NOR YET AT GREENWICH WAS ANY OPTICAL SEARCH UNDERTAKEN
5261-19373-0057 DID THE NEW THEORY EXPLAIN THE ERRORS OF THE RADIUS VECTOR OR NOT
5261-19373-0058 AND SIR JOHN HERSCHEL WAS ONE OF ITS SECTIONAL PRESIDENTS
5261-19373-0059 THE PAST YEAR HAS GIVEN TO US THE NEW MINOR PLANET ASTRAEA IT HAS DONE MORE IT HAS GIVEN US THE PROBABLE PROSPECT OF ANOTHER WE SEE IT AS COLUMBUS SAW AMERICA FROM THE SHORES OF SPAIN
5261-19373-0060 PROFESSOR CHALLIS SAID HE WOULD CONDUCT THE SEARCH HIMSELF AND SHORTLY COMMENCED A LEISURELY AND DIGNIFIED SERIES OF SWEEPS ROUND ABOUT THE PLACE ASSIGNED BY THEORY
5261-19373-0061 CATALOGUING ALL THE STARS WHICH HE OBSERVED INTENDING AFTERWARDS TO SORT OUT HIS OBSERVATIONS COMPARE ONE WITH ANOTHER AND FIND OUT WHETHER ANY ONE STAR HAD CHANGED ITS POSITION BECAUSE IF IT HAD IT MUST BE THE PLANET
5261-19373-0062 AND IF HE HAD COMPARED HIS OBSERVATIONS WITH THIS MAP AS THEY WERE MADE THE PROCESS WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY AND THE DISCOVERY QUICK BUT HE HAD NO SUCH MAP NEVERTHELESS ONE WAS IN EXISTENCE IT HAD JUST BEEN COMPLETED IN THAT COUNTRY OF ENLIGHTENED METHOD AND INDUSTRY GERMANY
5261-19373-0063 DOCTOR BREMIKER HAD NOT INDEED COMPLETED HIS GREAT WORK A CHART OF THE WHOLE ZODIAC DOWN TO STARS OF THE TENTH MAGNITUDE BUT PORTIONS OF IT WERE COMPLETED AND THE SPECIAL REGION WHERE THE NEW PLANET WAS EXPECTED HAPPENED TO BE AMONG THE PORTIONS ALREADY JUST DONE BUT IN ENGLAND
5261-19373-0064 THIS WAS NOT KNOWN MEANWHILE MISTER ADAMS WROTE TO THE ASTRONOMER ROYAL SEVERAL ADDITIONAL COMMUNICATIONS MAKING IMPROVEMENTS IN HIS THEORY AND GIVING WHAT HE CONSIDERED NEARER AND NEARER APPROXIMATIONS FOR THE PLACE OF THE PLANET HE ALSO NOW ANSWERED QUITE SATISFACTORILY
5261-19373-0065 ACTUATED PROBABLY BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IN SUCH MATTERS AS CATALOGUING AND MAPPING GERMANY WAS THEN AS NOW FAR AHEAD OF ALL THE OTHER NATIONS OF THE WORLD HE WROTE IN SEPTEMBER THE SAME SEPTEMBER AS SIR JOHN HERSCHEL DELIVERED HIS ELOQUENT ADDRESS AT SOUTHAMPTON TO BERLIN
5261-19373-0066 HEAD OF THE OBSERVATORY AT BERLIN SAYING TO HIM CLEARLY AND DECIDEDLY THAT THE NEW PLANET WAS NOW IN OR CLOSE TO SUCH AND SUCH A POSITION AND THAT IF HE WOULD POINT HIS TELESCOPE TO THAT PART OF THE HEAVENS HE WOULD SEE IT
5261-19373-0067 AND MOREOVER THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL IT FROM A STAR BY ITS HAVING A SENSIBLE MAGNITUDE OR DISK INSTEAD OF BEING A MERE POINT GALLE GOT THE LETTER ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX
5261-19373-0068 AND HE SAW THE PLANET THAT VERY NIGHT HE RECOGNIZED IT FIRST BY ITS APPEARANCE
5261-19373-0069 HE THEN CONSULTED BREMIKER'S GREAT STAR CHART THE PART JUST ENGRAVED AND FINISHED AND SURE ENOUGH ON THAT CHART THERE WAS NO SUCH STAR THERE UNDOUBTEDLY IT WAS THE PLANET
5261-19373-0070 THE NEWS FLASHED OVER EUROPE AT THE MAXIMUM SPEED WITH WHICH NEWS COULD TRAVEL AT THAT DATE WHICH WAS NOT VERY FAST
5261-19373-0071 AND HAD THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING THAT THEY WERE FORESTALLED AND THAT ENGLAND WAS OUT OF THE RACE IT WAS AN UNCONSCIOUS RACE TO ALL CONCERNED HOWEVER THOSE IN FRANCE KNEW NOTHING OF THE SEARCH GOING ON IN ENGLAND MISTER ADAMS'S PAPERS HAD NEVER BEEN PUBLISHED
5261-19373-0072 AND VERY ANNOYED THE FRENCH WERE WHEN A CLAIM WAS SET UP ON HIS BEHALF TO A SHARE IN THIS MAGNIFICENT DISCOVERY CONTROVERSIES AND RECRIMINATIONS EXCUSES AND JUSTIFICATIONS FOLLOWED BUT THE DISCUSSION HAS NOW SETTLED DOWN
5261-19373-0073 ALL THE WORLD HONOURS THE BRIGHT GENIUS AND MATHEMATICAL SKILL OF MISTER ADAMS AND RECOGNIZES THAT HE FIRST SOLVED THE PROBLEM BY CALCULATION
