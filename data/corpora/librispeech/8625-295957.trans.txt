8625-295957-0000 IN THIS WAY THEY WOULD SOMETIMES GET PIECES OF ROBES WORNOUT MOCCASINS WITH HOLES IN THEM AND BITS OF MEAT NOW IT HAPPENED ONE DAY AFTER THE TRIBE HAD MOVED AWAY FROM THE CAMP THAT THIS OLD WOMAN AND HER BOY WERE FOLLOWING ALONG THE TRAIL BEHIND THE REST
8625-295957-0001 WHEN THEY CAME TO A MISERABLE OLD WORNOUT DUN HORSE WHICH THEY SUPPOSED HAD BEEN ABANDONED BY SOME INDIANS HE WAS THIN AND EXHAUSTED WAS BLIND OF ONE EYE HAD A BAD SORE BACK AND ONE OF HIS FORELEGS WAS VERY MUCH SWOLLEN
8625-295957-0002 IN FACT HE WAS SO WORTHLESS THAT NONE OF THE PAWNEES HAD BEEN WILLING TO TAKE THE TROUBLE TO TRY TO DRIVE HIM ALONG WITH THEM BUT WHEN THE OLD WOMAN AND HER BOY CAME ALONG THE BOY SAID COME NOW WE WILL TAKE THIS OLD HORSE FOR WE CAN MAKE HIM CARRY OUR PACK
8625-295957-0003 SO THE OLD WOMAN PUT HER PACK ON THE HORSE AND DROVE HIM ALONG BUT HE LIMPED AND COULD ONLY GO VERY SLOWLY TWO THE TRIBE MOVED UP ON THE NORTH PLATTE UNTIL THEY CAME TO COURT HOUSE ROCK
8625-295957-0004 THE TWO POOR INDIANS FOLLOWED THEM AND CAMPED WITH THE OTHERS ONE DAY WHILE THEY WERE HERE THE YOUNG MEN WHO HAD BEEN SENT OUT TO LOOK FOR BUFFALO CAME HURRYING INTO CAMP AND TOLD THE CHIEFS THAT A LARGE HERD OF BUFFALO WERE NEAR AND THAT AMONG THEM WAS A SPOTTED CALF
8625-295957-0005 AND WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THE SPOTTED CALF HE ORDERED HIS OLD CRIER TO GO ABOUT THROUGH THE VILLAGE AND CALL OUT THAT THE MAN WHO KILLED THE SPOTTED CALF SHOULD HAVE HIS DAUGHTER FOR HIS WIFE FOR A SPOTTED ROBE
8625-295957-0006 BIG MEDICINE THE BUFFALO WERE FEEDING ABOUT FOUR MILES FROM THE VILLAGE AND THE CHIEFS DECIDED THAT THE CHARGE SHOULD BE MADE FROM THERE IN THIS WAY THE MAN WHO HAD THE FASTEST HORSE WOULD BE THE MOST LIKELY TO KILL THE CALF
8625-295957-0007 THEN ALL THE WARRIORS AND THE YOUNG MEN PICKED OUT THEIR BEST AND FASTEST HORSES AND MADE READY TO START AMONG THOSE WHO PREPARED FOR THE CHARGE WAS THE POOR BOY ON THE OLD DUN HORSE BUT WHEN THEY SAW HIM ALL THE RICH YOUNG BRAVES ON THEIR FAST HORSES POINTED AT HIM AND SAID OH SEE
8625-295957-0008 THERE IS THE HORSE THAT IS GOING TO CATCH THE SPOTTED CALF AND THEY LAUGHED AT HIM SO THAT THE POOR BOY WAS ASHAMED AND RODE OFF TO ONE SIDE OF THE CROWD WHERE HE COULD NOT HEAR THEIR JOKES AND LAUGHTER
8625-295957-0009 HE SAID TAKE ME DOWN THE CREEK AND PLASTER ME ALL OVER WITH MUD COVER MY HEAD AND NECK AND BODY AND LEGS WHEN THE BOY HEARD THE HORSE SPEAK HE WAS AFRAID BUT HE DID AS HE WAS TOLD THEN THE HORSE SAID NOW MOUNT
8625-295957-0010 BUT DO NOT RIDE BACK TO THE WARRIORS WHO LAUGH AT YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCH A POOR HORSE STAY RIGHT HERE UNTIL THE WORD IS GIVEN TO CHARGE SO THE BOY STAYED THERE AND PRESENTLY ALL THE FINE HORSES WERE DRAWN UP IN LINE AND PRANCED ABOUT
8625-295957-0011 AND WERE SO EAGER TO GO THAT THEIR RIDERS COULD HARDLY HOLD THEM IN AND AT LAST THE OLD CRIER GAVE THE WORD LOO AH GO THEN THE PAWNEES ALL LEANED FORWARD ON THEIR HORSES AND YELLED AND AWAY THEY WENT
8625-295957-0012 SUDDENLY AWAY OFF TO THE RIGHT WAS SEEN THE OLD DUN HORSE HE DID NOT SEEM TO RUN HE SEEMED TO SAIL ALONG LIKE A BIRD HE PASSED ALL THE FASTEST HORSES AND IN A MOMENT HE WAS AMONG THE BUFFALO FIRST HE PICKED OUT THE SPOTTED CALF
8625-295957-0013 AND CHARGING UP ALONGSIDE OF IT U RA RISH STRAIGHT FLEW THE ARROW THE CALF FELL THE BOY DREW ANOTHER ARROW AND KILLED A FAT COW THAT WAS RUNNING BY THEN HE DISMOUNTED AND BEGAN TO SKIN THE CALF BEFORE ANY OF THE OTHER WARRIORS HAD COME UP
8625-295957-0014 BUT WHEN THE RIDER GOT OFF THE OLD DUN HORSE HOW CHANGED HE WAS HE PRANCED ABOUT AND WOULD HARDLY STAND STILL NEAR THE DEAD BUFFALO HIS BACK WAS ALL RIGHT AGAIN HIS LEGS WERE WELL AND FINE AND BOTH HIS EYES WERE CLEAR AND BRIGHT
8625-295957-0015 THE BOY SKINNED THE CALF AND THE COW THAT HE HAD KILLED AND THEN HE PACKED ALL THE MEAT ON THE HORSE AND PUT THE SPOTTED ROBE ON TOP OF THE LOAD AND STARTED BACK TO THE CAMP ON FOOT LEADING THE DUN HORSE BUT EVEN WITH THIS HEAVY LOAD THE HORSE PRANCED ALL THE TIME AND WAS SCARED AT EVERYTHING HE SAW
8625-295957-0016 ON THE WAY TO CAMP ONE OF THE RICH YOUNG CHIEFS OF THE TRIBE RODE UP BY THE BOY AND OFFERED HIM TWELVE GOOD HORSES FOR THE SPOTTED ROBE
8625-295957-0017 BUT THE BOY LAUGHED AT HIM AND WOULD NOT SELL THE ROBE NOW WHILE THE BOY WALKED TO THE CAMP LEADING THE DUN HORSE MOST OF THE WARRIORS RODE BACK AND ONE OF THOSE THAT CAME FIRST TO THE VILLAGE WENT TO THE OLD WOMAN AND SAID TO HER YOUR GRANDSON HAS KILLED THE SPOTTED CALF
8625-295957-0018 AND THE OLD WOMAN SAID WHY DO YOU COME TO TELL ME THIS YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED TO MAKE FUN OF MY BOY BECAUSE HE IS POOR
8625-295957-0019 AND THEN HE RODE AWAY AFTER A LITTLE WHILE ANOTHER BRAVE RODE UP TO THE OLD WOMAN AND SAID TO HER YOUR GRANDSON HAS KILLED THE SPOTTED CALF THEN THE OLD WOMAN BEGAN TO CRY SHE FELT SO BADLY BECAUSE EVERY ONE MADE FUN OF HER BOY BECAUSE HE WAS POOR
8625-295957-0020 PRETTY SOON THE BOY CAME ALONG LEADING THE HORSE UP TO THE LODGE WHERE HE AND HIS GRANDMOTHER LIVED IT WAS A LITTLE LODGE JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO
8625-295957-0021 AND WAS TIED TOGETHER WITH STRINGS OF RAWHIDE AND SINEW IT WAS THE MEANEST AND WORST LODGE IN THE VILLAGE
8625-295957-0022 SHE WAS VERY SURPRISED THE BOY SAID TO HER HERE I HAVE BROUGHT YOU PLENTY OF MEAT TO EAT AND HERE IS A ROBE THAT YOU MAY HAVE FOR YOURSELF TAKE THE MEAT OFF THE HORSE THEN THE OLD WOMAN LAUGHED FOR HER HEART WAS GLAD
8625-295957-0023 BUT WHEN SHE WENT TO TAKE THE MEAT FROM THE HORSE'S BACK HE SNORTED AND JUMPED ABOUT AND ACTED LIKE A WILD HORSE THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED AT HIM IN WONDER AND COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT IT WAS THE SAME HORSE SO THE BOY HAD TO TAKE OFF THE MEAT FOR THE HORSE WOULD NOT LET THE OLD WOMAN COME NEAR HIM
8625-295957-0024 THREE THAT NIGHT THE HORSE SPOKE AGAIN TO THE BOY AND SAID WA TI HES CHAH' RA RAT WA TA TOMORROW THE SIOUX ARE COMING A LARGE WAR PARTY THEY WILL ATTACK THE VILLAGE AND YOU WILL HAVE A GREAT BATTLE NOW
8625-295957-0025 WHEN THE SIOUX ARE ALL DRAWN UP IN LINE OF BATTLE AND ARE ALL READY TO FIGHT
8625-295957-0026 AND UP TO THEIR HEAD CHIEF THEIR GREATEST WARRIOR AND COUNT COUP ON HIM AND KILL HIM AND THEN RIDE BACK DO THIS FOUR TIMES AND COUNT COUP ON FOUR OF THE BRAVEST SIOUX AND KILL THEM BUT DON'T GO AGAIN
8625-295957-0027 IF YOU GO THE FIFTH TIME MAYBE YOU WILL BE KILLED OR ELSE YOU WILL LOSE ME
8625-295957-0028 SO THE BOY PROMISED THE NEXT DAY IT HAPPENED AS THE HORSE HAD SAID AND THE SIOUX CAME DOWN AND FORMED IN LINE OF BATTLE THEN THE BOY TOOK HIS BOW AND ARROWS AND JUMPED ON THE DUN HORSE AND CHARGED INTO THE MIDST OF THEM AND WHEN THE SIOUX SAW THAT HE WAS GOING TO STRIKE THEIR HEAD CHIEF
8625-295957-0029 AND THE ARROWS FLEW SO THICKLY ACROSS EACH OTHER THAT THEY DARKENED THE SKY BUT NONE OF THEM HIT THE BOY AND HE COUNTED COUP ON THE CHIEF AND KILLED HIM AND THEN RODE BACK AFTER THAT HE CHARGED AGAIN AMONG THE SIOUX WHERE THEY WERE GATHERED THICKEST
8625-295957-0030 AND COUNTED COUP ON THEIR BRAVEST WARRIOR AND KILLED HIM AND THEN TWICE MORE UNTIL HE HAD GONE FOUR TIMES AS THE HORSE HAD TOLD HIM BUT THE SIOUX AND THE PAWNEES KEPT ON FIGHTING AND THE BOY STOOD AROUND AND WATCHED THE BATTLE AND AT LAST HE SAID TO HIMSELF I HAVE BEEN FOUR TIMES
8625-295957-0031 AND HAVE KILLED FOUR SIOUX AND I AM ALL RIGHT I AM NOT HURT ANYWHERE WHY MAY I NOT GO AGAIN SO HE JUMPED ON THE DUN HORSE AND CHARGED AGAIN BUT WHEN HE GOT AMONG THE SIOUX ONE SIOUX WARRIOR DREW AN ARROW AND SHOT THE ARROW STRUCK THE DUN HORSE BEHIND THE FORELEGS
8625-295957-0032 AND PIERCED HIM THROUGH AND THE HORSE FELL DOWN DEAD BUT THE BOY JUMPED OFF AND FOUGHT HIS WAY THROUGH THE SIOUX AND RAN AWAY AS FAST AS HE COULD TO THE PAWNEES NOW AS SOON AS THE HORSE WAS KILLED THE SIOUX SAID TO EACH OTHER THIS HORSE WAS LIKE A MAN HE WAS BRAVE HE WAS NOT LIKE A HORSE
8625-295957-0033 AND THEY TOOK THEIR KNIVES AND HATCHETS AND HACKED THE DUN HORSE AND GASHED HIS FLESH AND CUT HIM INTO SMALL PIECES THE PAWNEES AND SIOUX FOUGHT ALL DAY LONG BUT TOWARD NIGHT THE SIOUX BROKE AND FLED
8625-295957-0034 AND AFTER THE FIGHT WAS OVER HE WENT OUT FROM THE VILLAGE TO WHERE IT HAD TAKEN PLACE TO MOURN FOR HIS HORSE HE WENT TO THE SPOT WHERE THE HORSE LAY AND GATHERED UP ALL THE PIECES OF FLESH WHICH THE SIOUX HAD CUT OFF AND THE LEGS AND THE HOOFS AND PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER IN A PILE
8625-295957-0035 THEN HE WENT OFF TO THE TOP OF A HILL NEAR BY AND SAT DOWN AND DREW HIS ROBE OVER HIS HEAD AND BEGAN TO MOURN FOR HIS HORSE AS HE SAT THERE HE HEARD A GREAT WIND STORM COMING UP AND IT PASSED OVER HIM WITH A LOUD RUSHING SOUND AND AFTER THE WIND CAME A RAIN
8625-295957-0036 THE BOY LOOKED DOWN FROM WHERE HE SAT TO THE PILE OF FLESH AND BONES WHICH WAS ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF HIS HORSE AND HE COULD JUST SEE IT THROUGH THE RAIN AND THE RAIN PASSED BY AND HIS HEART WAS VERY HEAVY AND HE KEPT ON MOURNING AND PRETTY SOON CAME ANOTHER RUSHING WIND AND AFTER IT A RAIN
8625-295957-0037 AND AS HE LOOKED THROUGH THE DRIVING RAIN TOWARD THE SPOT WHERE THE PIECES LAY HE THOUGHT THAT THEY SEEMED TO COME TOGETHER AND TAKE SHAPE AND THAT THE PILE LOOKED LIKE A HORSE LYING DOWN BUT HE COULD NOT SEE WELL FOR THE THICK RAIN AFTER THIS CAME A THIRD STORM LIKE THE OTHERS
8625-295957-0038 AND NOW WHEN HE LOOKED TOWARD THE HORSE HE THOUGHT HE SAW ITS TAIL MOVE FROM SIDE TO SIDE TWO OR THREE TIMES AND THAT IT LIFTED ITS HEAD FROM THE GROUND THE BOY WAS AFRAID AND WANTED TO RUN AWAY BUT HE STAYED AND AS HE WAITED THERE CAME ANOTHER STORM
8625-295957-0039 AND WHILE THE RAIN FELL LOOKING THROUGH THE RAIN THE BOY SAW THE HORSE RAISE HIMSELF UP ON HIS FORELEGS AND LOOK ABOUT THEN THE DUN HORSE STOOD UP
8625-295957-0040 THE BOY LEFT THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD BEEN SITTING ON THE HILLTOP AND WENT DOWN TO HIM
8625-295957-0041 YOU HAVE SEEN HOW IT HAS BEEN THIS DAY AND FROM THIS YOU MAY KNOW HOW IT WILL BE AFTER THIS BUT TI RA' WA HAS BEEN GOOD AND HAS LET ME COME BACK TO YOU AFTER THIS DO WHAT I TELL YOU NOT ANY MORE NOT ANY LESS
8625-295957-0042 THEN THE HORSE SAID NOW LEAD ME OFF FAR AWAY FROM THE CAMP BEHIND THAT BIG HILL AND LEAVE ME THERE TO NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING COME FOR ME AND THE BOY DID AS HE WAS TOLD
8625-295957-0043 MUCH MORE HANDSOME THAN ANY HORSE IN THE TRIBE THAT NIGHT THE DUN HORSE TOLD THE BOY TO TAKE HIM AGAIN TO THE PLACE BEHIND THE BIG HILL AND TO COME FOR HIM THE NEXT MORNING AND WHEN THE BOY WENT FOR HIM AGAIN
8625-295957-0044 AND SO FOR TEN NIGHTS HE LEFT THE HORSE AMONG THE HILLS AND EACH MORNING HE FOUND A DIFFERENT COLOURED HORSE A BAY A ROAN A GRAY A BLUE A SPOTTED HORSE AND ALL OF THEM FINER THAN ANY HORSES THAT THE PAWNEES HAD EVER HAD IN THEIR TRIBE BEFORE
8625-295957-0045 NOW THE BOY WAS RICH AND HE MARRIED THE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER OF THE HEAD CHIEF AND WHEN HE BECAME OLDER HE WAS MADE HEAD CHIEF HIMSELF HE HAD MANY CHILDREN BY HIS BEAUTIFUL WIFE AND ONE DAY WHEN HIS OLDEST BOY DIED HE WRAPPED HIM IN THE SPOTTED CALF ROBE AND BURIED HIM IN IT
8625-295957-0046 HE ALWAYS TOOK GOOD CARE OF HIS OLD GRANDMOTHER AND KEPT HER IN HIS OWN LODGE UNTIL SHE DIED
