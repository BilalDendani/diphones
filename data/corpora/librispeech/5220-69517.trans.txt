5220-69517-0000 PACIFIC THUNDERED IN UPON THEM THEY COULD HEAR THE WINDS CALLING AND CALLING WITH AN IMMEMORIAL INVITATION THEY KNEW OF THE LITTLE JEWELLED ISLANDS THAT LAY OUT IN THE SEAS AND OF THE LANDS OF ELD ON THE FAR FAR SHORE
5220-69517-0001 AND THEY DREAMED STRANGE DREAMS SITTING IN THE TWILIGHT WATCHING THE LIGHT RELUCTANTLY LEAVE THE SEA THEY SPOKE OF MANY THINGS THEY SPOKE MOST OF ALL OF WOMEN AND IT SOMETIMES SEEMED AS THEY SAT THERE
5220-69517-0002 ONE AT THE DOORWAY OF THE HOUSE OF LIFE AND ONE IN A SHADED INNER CHAMBER AS IF THE RUNE OF WOMEN CAME TO THEM FROM THEIR FAR SISTERS FROM THOSE IN THEIR HAREMS FROM OTHERS IN THE BLARE OF COMMERCIAL OCCIDENTAL LIFE
5220-69517-0003 FROM THOSE IN CHAMBERS OF PAIN FROM THOSE FREIGHTED WITH THE POIGNANT BURDENS WHICH WOMEN BEAR IN THEIR BODIES AND IN THEIR SOULS AS THE DARKNESS DEEPENED
5220-69517-0004 THEY GREW UNASHAMED AND THEN RETICENCES FELL FROM THEM THE ETERNALLY FLOWING SEA THE EVER RECURRENT NIGHT GAVE THEM COURAGE THOUGH THEY WERE WOMEN TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
5220-69517-0005 THAN I WOULD HAVE CAST AWAY A HOPE OF HEAVEN IF I HAD SEEN THAT SHINING BEFORE ME I WOULD NO MORE HAVE TURNED FROM IT THAN I WOULD HAVE TURNED FROM FOOD IF I HAD BEEN STARVING OR WATER AFTER I HAD BEEN THIRSTING IN THE DESERT WHY
5220-69517-0006 KATE TO MARRY HIM WAS INEVITABLE THE BIRD DOESN'T THINK WHEN IT SINGS OR THE BUD WHEN IT FLOWERS IT DOES WHAT IT WAS CREATED TO DO I MARRIED DAVID THE SAME WAY I UNDERSTAND SAID KATE
5220-69517-0007 THEY SAT ON THEIR LITTLE LOW SAND SWEPT BALCONY FACING THE SEA THE RISING TIDE FILLED THE WORLD WITH ITS SOFT AND INDESCRIBABLE CADENCE THE STARS CAME OUT INTO THE SKY ACCORDING TO THEIR RANK
5220-69517-0008 THE GREATEST FIRST AND AFTER THEM THE LESS AND THE LESS NO MORE LACKING IN BEAUTY THAN THE GREAT ALL WAS AS IT SHOULD BE ALL WAS ORDERED ALL WAS FIT AND WONDERFUL
5220-69517-0009 SO WENT ON HONORA AFTER A SILENCE WHICH THE SEA FILLED IN WITH ITS LOW HARMONIES IF YOU LOVED KARL WAIT SAID KATE SO HONORA WAITED
5220-69517-0010 ANOTHER SILENCE FELL THEN KATE SPOKE BROKENLY IF TO FEEL WHEN I AM WITH HIM THAT I HAVE REACHED MY HOME
5220-69517-0011 AND TO FEEL LESS FAMILIAR WITH MYSELF THAN WITH HIM IS TO LOVE THEN I LOVE HIM HONORA IF TO WANT TO WORK WITH HIM AND TO FEEL THERE COULD BE NO EXULTATION LIKE OVERCOMING DIFFICULTIES WITH HIM IS LOVE
5220-69517-0012 THEN TRULY I LOVE HIM IF JUST TO SEE HIM AT A DISTANCE ENRICHES THE WORLD AND MAKES THE STREAM OF TIME TURN FROM LEAD TO GOLD IS ANYTHING IN THE NATURE OF LOVE
5220-69517-0013 THEN I AM HIS LOVER IF TO LONG TO HOUSE WITH HIM TO GO BY THE SAME NAME THAT HE DOES TO WEAR HIM SO TO SPEAK CARVED ON MY BROW IS TO LOVE THEN I DO
5220-69517-0014 THEN I FORESEE THAT YOU WILL BE ONE OF THE HAPPIEST WOMEN IN THE WORLD NO NO YOU MUSTN'T SAY THAT AREN'T THERE OTHER THINGS THAN LOVE HONORA BETTER THINGS THAN SELFISH DELIGHT
5220-69517-0015 UNSELFISH PEOPLE OR THOSE WHO MEAN TO BE SO CONTRIVE WHEN THEY REFUSE TO FOLLOW THE INSTINCTS OF THEIR HEARTS TO CAUSE MORE SUFFERING EVEN THAN THE OUT AND OUT SELFISH ONES
5220-69517-0016 I CAN SET IN MOTION A MOVEMENT WHICH MAY HAVE A MORE LASTING EFFECT UPON MY COUNTRY THAN ANY VICTORY EVER GAINED BY IT ON A FIELD OF BATTLE AND PERHAPS IN TIME THE EXAMPLE SET BY THIS LAND WILL BE FOLLOWED BY OTHERS
5220-69517-0017 I GIVE HIM ALL MY LIFE AND I RESIGN MY BIRTHRIGHT OF LABOR
5220-69517-0018 I LET THE DREAM PERISH I HINDER A GREAT WORK OH HONORA I WANT HIM I WANT HIM BUT AM I FOR THAT REASON TO BE FALSE TO MY DESTINY
5220-69517-0019 YOU WANT CELEBRITY SAID HONORA WITH SUDDEN BITTERNESS YOU WANT TO GO TO WASHINGTON TO HAVE YOUR NAME NUMBERED AMONG THE LEADING ONES OF THE NATION
5220-69517-0020 YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO SPEND YOUR DAYS IN THE SOLITUDE OF WILLISTON RANCH AS WIFE TO ITS MASTER I WILL NOT SAY THAT YOU ARE SPEAKING FALSELY BUT I THINK YOU KNOW YOU ARE SETTING OUT ONLY A LITTLE PART OF THE TRUTH
5220-69517-0021 ADMIT IT HONORA HONORA SIGHED HEAVILY OH YES
5220-69517-0022 YOU MUST FORGIVE ME KATE IT SEEMS SO EASY FOR YOU TWO TO BE HAPPY THAT I CAN'T HELP FEELING IT BLASPHEMOUS FOR YOU TO BE ANYTHING ELSE IF IT WERE AN ORDINARY MARRIAGE OR AN ORDINARY SEPARATION
5220-69517-0023 IT WOULD BE EPIC AND I SHOULD REJOICE THAT YOU WERE LIVING IN THAT SAVAGE WORLD INSTEAD OF IN A CITY YOU TWO WOULD NEED ROOM LIKE GREAT BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS WHO WOULD WISH TO SEE YOU IN THE JUMBLE OF A CITY
5220-69517-0024 WITH YOU TO AID HIM KARL MAY BECOME A DISTINGUISHED MAN YOUR LIVES WOULD GO ON TOGETHER WIDENING WIDENING OH INTERRUPTED KATE WITH A SHARP EJACULATION WE'LL NOT TALK OF IT ANY MORE HONORA
5220-69517-0025 YOU MUST NOT THINK BECAUSE I CANNOT MARRY HIM THAT HE WILL ALWAYS BE UNHAPPY IN TIME HE WILL FIND ANOTHER WOMAN KATE WILL YOU FIND ANOTHER MAN
5220-69517-0026 ANY MAN WOULD BE AN ANTICLIMAX TO ME AFTER HIM CAN YOU SUSPECT HIM OF A PASSION OR A FEALTY LESS THAN YOUR OWN IF YOU REFUSE TO MARRY HIM I BELIEVE YOU WILL FRUSTRATE A GREAT PURPOSE OF NATURE
5220-69517-0027 WHY KATE IT WILL BE A CRIME AGAINST LOVE
5220-69517-0028 THAN I CAN MAKE THE WORDS CONVEY TO YOU BUT YOU MUST THINK THEM OVER KATE I BEG YOU TO THINK THEM OVER IN THE DARKNESS KATE HEARD HONORA STEALING AWAY TO HER ROOM
5220-69517-0029 SO SHE WAS ALONE AND THE HOUR HAD COME FOR HER DECISION BITTER ALAS SHE QUOTED TO THE RISING TROUBLE OF THE SEA THE SORROW OF LONELY WOMEN
5220-69517-0030 WE WHO SUFFER MOST ARE THOSE WHO MOST DO LOVE SHE WENT DOWN UPON THE SANDS THE TONGUES OF THE SEA CAME UP AND LAPPED HER FEET THE WINDS OF THE SEA ENFOLDED HER IN AN EMBRACE
5220-69517-0031 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE FREELY WITHOUT RESTRAINT BRAVELY AS SOMETIME SHE MIGHT FACE GOD SHE CONFRONTED THE IDEA OF LOVE AND A SECRET WONDERFUL KNOWLEDGE CAME TO HER
5220-69517-0032 THE KNOWLEDGE OF LOVELY SPIRITUAL ECSTASIES THE REALIZATION OF RICH HUMAN DELIGHTS SORROW AND CRUEL LOSS MIGHT BE ON THEIR WAY BUT JOY WAS HERS NOW
5220-69517-0033 SHE FEIGNED THAT KARL WAS WAITING FOR HER A LITTLE WAY ON IN THE WARM DARKNESS ON AROUND THAT SCIMITAR SHAPED BEND OF THE BEACH SHE CHOSE TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS RUNNING TO MEET HER HIS EYES AFLAME
5220-69517-0034 HIS GREAT ARMS OUTSTRETCHED SHE THRILLED TO THE RAIN OF HIS KISSES SHE THOUGHT THOSE STARS MIGHT HEAR THE VOICE WITH WHICH HE SHOUTED KATE THEN CALMER YET AS IF SHE HAD RUN A RACE
5220-69517-0035 PANTING PALPITANT SHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE SANDS SHE LET HER IMAGINATION ROAM THROUGH THE YEARS SHE SAW THE ROAD OF LIFE THEY WOULD TAKE TOGETHER HOW THEY WOULD STAND ON PEAKS OF LOFTY DESIRE IN SUNLIGHT
5220-69517-0036 HOW UNFALTERING THEY WOULD PACE TENEBROUS VALLEYS ALWAYS THEY WOULD BE TOGETHER THEIR LAUGHTER WOULD CHIME AND THEIR TEARS WOULD FALL IN UNISON WHERE ONE FAILED THE OTHER WOULD REDEEM WHERE ONE DOUBTED THE OTHER WOULD HOPE
5220-69517-0037 THEY WOULD BEAR THEIR CHILDREN TO BE THE VEHICLE OF THEIR IDEALS THESE FRESH NEW CREATURES BORN OF THEIR LOVE WOULD BE TRAINED TO ACHIEVE WHAT THEY THEIR PARENTS HAD SOMEHOW MISSED THEN HER BOLDER THOUGHT DIED
5220-69517-0038 SHE WHO HAD FORCED HERSELF SO RELENTLESSLY TO FACE THE WORLD AS A WOMAN FACES IT WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE COURAGE OF MATURITY FELT HER WISDOM SLIP FROM HER SHE WAS A GIRL VERY LONELY
5220-69517-0039 FACING A TASK TOO LARGE FOR HER NEEDING THE COMFORT OF HER LOVER'S WORD SHE STRETCHED HERSELF UPON THE SAND FACE DOWNWARD WEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID OF LIFE
5220-69517-0040 BECAUSE SHE WAS WISHFUL FOR THE JOY OF WOMAN AND DARED NOT TAKE IT HAVE YOU DECIDED ASKED HONORA IN THE MORNING I THINK SO
5220-69517-0041 ANSWERED KATE HONORA SCRUTINIZED THE FACE OF HER FRIEND ACCEPT SHE SAID MY PROFOUND COMMISERATION HER TONE SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT SHE INCLUDED CONTEMPT
5220-69517-0042 AFTER THIS THERE WAS A CHANGE IN HONORA'S ATTITUDE TOWARD HER KATE FELT HERSELF MORE ALONE THAN SHE EVER HAD BEEN IN HER LIFE IT WAS AS IF SHE HAD BEEN CAST OUT INTO A DESERT
5220-69517-0043 AND IN IT WAS NO HOUSE OF REFUGE NO COMFORTABLE TREE NO WATERS OF HEALING NO NOR ANY OTHER SOUL ALONE SHE WALKED THERE AND THE ONLY FIGURES SHE SAW WERE THOSE OF THE MIRAGE
5220-69517-0044 IT GAVE HER A SORT OF RELIEF TO TURN HER FACE EASTWARD AND TO FEEL THAT SHE MUST TRAVERSE THE ACTUAL DESERT
