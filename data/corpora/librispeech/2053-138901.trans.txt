2053-138901-0000 THE SCENE WAS ON THE HIGH ROAD FROM SHAP TO VAVASOR AND AS SHE WAS STILL DRESSED IN ALL THE SOMBRE HABILIMENTS OF EARLY WIDOWHOOD AND AS NEITHER HE NOR HIS SWEETHEART WERE UNDER FORTY PERHAPS IT WAS AS WELL THAT THEY WERE NOT CAUGHT TOYING
2053-138901-0001 TOGETHER IN SO VERY PUBLIC A PLACE BUT THEY WERE ONLY JUST IN TIME TO ESCAPE THE VIGILANT EYES OF A NEW VISITOR ROUND THE CORNER OF THE ROAD AT A SHARP TROT CAME THE SHAP POST HORSE WITH THE SHAP GIG BEHIND HIM
2053-138901-0002 THE SAME GIG WHICH HAD BROUGHT BELLFIELD TO VAVASOR ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AND SEATED IN THE GIG LOOMING LARGE WITH HIS EYES WIDE AWAKE TO EVERYTHING ROUND HIM WAS MISTER CHEESACRE
2053-138901-0003 AND BY NO MEANS WELCOME TO THOSE OF MISSUS GREENOW AS REGARDED HER HER ANNOYANCE HAD CHIEFLY REFERENCE TO HER TWO NIECES AND ESPECIALLY TO ALICE HOW WAS SHE TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS SECOND LOVER KATE OF COURSE KNEW ALL ABOUT IT
2053-138901-0004 THAT SHE HAD IN SOBER TRUTH TOLD THIS ARDENT GENTLEMAN THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE FOR HIM AND EVEN AS TO KATE KATE WHOM HER AUNT HAD ABSURDLY CHOSEN TO REGARD AS THE OBJECT OF MISTER CHEESACRE'S PURSUIT
2053-138901-0005 WHAT SORT OF A WELCOME WOULD SHE EXTEND TO THE OWNER OF OILEYMEAD BEFORE THE WHEELS HAD STOPPED
2053-138901-0006 BUT IF MISSUS GREENOW WAS DISMAYED WHAT WERE THE FEELINGS OF THE CAPTAIN FOR HE WAS AWARE THAT CHEESACRE KNEW THAT OF HIM WHICH HE HAD NOT TOLD HOW ARDENTLY DID HE NOW WISH THAT HE HAD SAILED NEARER TO THE TRUTH
2053-138901-0007 TO MISSUS GREENOW THAT MAN'S WANTED BY THE POLICE SAID CHEESACRE
2053-138901-0008 HE'S WANTED BY THE POLICE MISSUS GREENOW AND IN HIS ARDOUR HE STOOD UP IN THE GIG AND POINTED AT BELLFIELD
2053-138901-0009 AND HE FELL BACK INTO HIS SEAT IN HIS EFFORT TO PREVENT HIS FALLING FORWARD HE'S WANTED BY THE POLICE HE SHOUTED OUT AGAIN AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE TO RECOVER HIS VOICE MISSUS GREENOW TURNED PALE BENEATH THE WIDOW'S VEIL WHICH SHE HAD DROPPED
2053-138901-0010 WHAT MIGHT NOT HER CAPTAIN HAVE DONE HE MIGHT HAVE PROCURED THINGS TO BE SENT TO HIM OUT OF SHOPS ON FALSE PRETENCES OR URGED ON BY WANT AND FAMINE HE MIGHT HAVE COMMITTED FORGERY OH MY SHE SAID
2053-138901-0011 AND DROPPED HER HAND FROM HIS ARM WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN IT'S FALSE SAID BELLFIELD IT'S TRUE SAID CHEESACRE I'LL INDICT YOU FOR SLANDER MY FRIEND SAID BELLFIELD PAY ME THE MONEY YOU OWE ME SAID CHEESACRE YOU'RE A SWINDLER
2053-138901-0012 MISSUS GREENOW CARED LITTLE AS TO HER LOVER BEING A SWINDLER IN MISTER CHEESACRE'S ESTIMATION SUCH ACCUSATIONS FROM HIM SHE HAD HEARD BEFORE
2053-138901-0013 WHAT IS THIS I HEAR CAPTAIN BELLFIELD SHE SAID IT'S A LIE AND A SLANDER HE MERELY WANTS TO MAKE A QUARREL BETWEEN US WHAT POLICE ARE AFTER ME MISTER CHEESACRE IT'S THE POLICE OR THE SHERIFF'S OFFICER OR SOMETHING OF THE KIND SAID CHEESACRE
2053-138901-0014 OH THE SHERIFF'S OFFICERS EXCLAIMED MISSUS GREENOW IN A TONE OF VOICE WHICH SHOWED HOW GREAT HAD BEEN HER RELIEF MISTER CHEESACRE YOU SHOULDN'T COME AND SAY SUCH THINGS YOU SHOULDN'T INDEED SHERIFF'S OFFICERS CAN BE PAID AND THERE'S AN END OF THEM
2053-138901-0015 I'LL INDICT HIM FOR THE LIBEL I WILL AS SURE AS I'M ALIVE SAID BELLFIELD NONSENSE SAID THE WIDOW DON'T YOU MAKE A FOOL OF YOURSELF
2053-138901-0016 WHEN MEN CAN'T PAY THEIR WAY THEY MUST PUT UP WITH HAVING THINGS LIKE THAT SAID OF THEM MISTER CHEESACRE WHERE WERE YOU GOING I WAS GOING TO VAVASOR HALL ON PURPOSE TO CAUTION YOU IT'S TOO LATE SAID MISSUS GREENOW SINKING BEHIND HER VEIL
2053-138901-0017 WHY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AND MARRIED HIM SINCE YESTERDAY HE ONLY HAD TWENTY FOUR HOURS START OF ME I KNOW
2053-138901-0018 HE GOT OUT OF THE GIG AND THE THREE WALKED BACK TOWARDS THE HALL TOGETHER
2053-138901-0019 I'M NOT ONE TO INTRUDE WHERE I'M NOT WANTED YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT IF I CAN'T GET MY SUPPER FOR LOVE I CAN GET AT FOR MONEY
2053-138901-0020 MOREOVER HAD CONTRIVED TO WHISPER INTO THE WIDOW'S EARS THE TRUE EXTENT OF HIS ERRAND INTO WESTMORELAND THIS HOWEVER HE DID NOT DO ALTOGETHER IN BELLFIELD'S HEARING WHEN MISSUS GREENOW ASCERTAINED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING TO BE SAID SHE MADE NO SCRUPLE IN SENDING
2053-138901-0021 HER BETROTHED AWAY FROM HER YOU WON'T THROW A FELLOW OVER WILL YOU NOW
2053-138901-0022 SHE MERELY FROWNED AT HIM AND BADE HIM BEGONE SO THAT THE WALK WHICH MISSUS GREENOW BEGAN WITH ONE LOVER SHE ENDED IN COMPANY WITH THE OTHER BELLFIELD WHO WAS SENT ON TO THE HOUSE
2053-138901-0023 FOUND ALICE AND KATE SURVEYING THE NEWLY ARRIVED CARPET BAG HE KNOWS UN SAID THE BOY WHO HAD DRIVEN THE GIG POINTING TO THE CAPTAIN
2053-138901-0024 HE NEVER HAD A CHANCE IN THAT QUARTER NOT ENOUGH OF THE ROCKS AND VALLEYS ABOUT HIM WAS THERE CAPTAIN BELLFIELD SAID KATE BUT CAPTAIN BELLFIELD UNDERSTOOD NOTHING ABOUT THE ROCKS AND VALLEYS
2053-138901-0025 IN THE MEANTIME CHEESACRE WAS TELLING HIS STORY HE FIRST ASKED IN A MELANCHOLY TONE WHETHER IT WAS REALLY NECESSARY THAT HE MUST ABANDON ALL HIS HOPES
2053-138901-0026 IF THINGS WERE REALLY FIXED HE NEVER BEGRUDGED ANY MAN HIS CHANCE THINGS ARE REALLY FIXED SAID MISSUS GREENOW
2053-138901-0027 AND THAT BELLFIELD HAD NOT AS MUCH AS A STRAW MATTRESS TO LIE UPON IN ANSWER TO THIS MISSUS GREENOW TOLD HIM THAT THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE REASON WHY SOME ONE SHOULD PROVIDE THE POOR MAN WITH A MATTRESS IF YOU LOOK AT IT IN THAT LIGHT OF COURSE IT'S TRUE
2053-138901-0028 SAID CHEESACRE MISSUS GREENOW TOLD HIM THAT SHE DID LOOK AT IT IN THAT LIGHT
2053-138901-0029 I MUST GIVE HIM HIS TIME ABOUT IT I SUPPOSE MISSUS GREENOW ASSURED HIM THAT IT SHOULD BE PAID AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER THE NUPTIAL BENEDICTION HAD BEEN SAID OVER THEM SHE OFFERED INDEED TO PAY IT AT ONCE IF HE WAS IN DISTRESS FOR IT
2053-138901-0030 BUT HE ANSWERED CONTEMPTUOUSLY THAT HE NEVER WAS IN DISTRESS FOR MONEY HE LIKED TO HAVE HIS OWN THAT WAS ALL AFTER THIS HE DID NOT GET AWAY TO HIS NEXT SUBJECT QUITE SO EASILY AS HE WISHED AND IT MUST BE ADMITTED
2053-138901-0031 THAT THERE WAS A DIFFICULTY AS HE COULD NOT HAVE MISSUS GREENOW HE WOULD BE CONTENT TO PUT UP WITH KATE FOR HIS WIFE THAT WAS HIS NEXT SUBJECT RUMOURS AS TO THE OLD SQUIRE'S WILL HAD NO DOUBT REACHED HIM
2053-138901-0032 AND HE WAS NOW WILLING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT ASSISTANCE WHICH MISSUS GREENOW HAD BEFORE OFFERED HIM IN THIS MATTER THE TIME HAD COME IN WHICH HE OUGHT TO MARRY OF THAT HE WAS AWARE HE HAD TOLD MANY OF HIS FRIENDS IN NORFOLK THAT KATE VAVASOR HAD THROWN HERSELF AT HIS HEAD
2053-138901-0033 AND VERY PROBABLY HE HAD THOUGHT IT TRUE IN ANSWER TO ALL HIS LOVE SPEECHES TO HERSELF THE AUNT HAD ALWAYS TOLD HIM WHAT AN EXCELLENT WIFE HER NIECE WOULD MAKE HIM SO NOW HE HAD COME TO WESTMORELAND WITH THIS SECOND STRING TO HIS BOW
2053-138901-0034 YOU KNOW YOU PUT IT INTO MY HEAD YOUR OWN SELF PLEADED MISTER CHEESACRE DIDN'T YOU NOW BUT THINGS ARE SO DIFFERENT SINCE THAT SAID THE WIDOW HOW DIFFERENT I AIN'T DIFFERENT
2053-138901-0035 HOW ARE THINGS DIFFERENT MY NIECE HAS INHERITED PROPERTY AND IS THAT TO MAKE A CHANGE OH MISSUS GREENOW WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT TO FIND YOU MERCENARY LIKE THAT INHERITED PROPERTY IS SHE GOING TO FLING A MAN OVER BECAUSE OF THAT
2053-138901-0036 WHY MISTER CHEESACRE I AM QUITE SURE SHE NEVER GAVE YOU A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT IN HER LIFE BUT YOU ALWAYS TOLD ME I MIGHT HAVE HER FOR THE ASKING AND NOW I TELL YOU THAT YOU MAYN'T IT'S OF NO USE YOUR GOING ON THERE TO ASK HER
2053-138901-0037 FOR SHE WILL ONLY SEND YOU AWAY WITH AN ANSWER YOU WON'T LIKE LOOK HERE MISTER CHEESACRE YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED AND IT'S QUITE TIME YOU SHOULD THERE'S MY DEAR FRIEND CHARLIE FAIRSTAIRS HOW COULD YOU GET A BETTER WIFE THAN CHARLIE
2053-138901-0038 SHE HASN'T GOT A PENNY NOR ANY ONE BELONGING TO HER THE MAN WHO MARRIES HER WILL HAVE TO FIND THE MONEY FOR THE SMOCK SHE STANDS UP IN WHO'S MERCENARY NOW MISTER CHEESACRE DO YOU GO HOME AND THINK OF IT
2053-138901-0039 AND IF YOU'LL MARRY CHARLIE I'LL GO TO YOUR WEDDING YOU SHAN'T BE ASHAMED OF HER CLOTHING I'LL SEE TO THAT THEY WERE NOW CLOSE TO THE GATE AND CHEESACRE PAUSED BEFORE HE ENTERED
2053-138901-0040 I'VE HEARD HER SPEAK ABOUT IT SOMEBODY ELSE PERHAPS IS THE HAPPY MAN I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT BUT I KNOW THAT SHE WOULDN'T TAKE YOU I LIKE FARMING YOU KNOW BUT SHE DOESN'T I MIGHT GIVE THAT UP SAID CHEESACRE READILY
2053-138901-0041 AT ANY RATE FOR A TIME NO NO NO IT WOULD DO NO GOOD
2053-138901-0042 HE STILL PAUSED AT THE GATE
2053-138901-0043 TO THIS SHE MADE HIM NO ANSWER THERE'S A PRIDE ABOUT ME HE CONTINUED THAT I DON'T CHOOSE TO GO WHERE I'M NOT WANTED I CAN'T TELL YOU MISTER CHEESACRE THAT YOU ARE WANTED IN THAT LIGHT CERTAINLY THEN I'LL GO
2053-138901-0044 PERHAPS YOU'LL BE SO GOOD AS TO TELL THE BOY WITH THE GIG TO COME AFTER ME THAT'S SIX POUND TEN
2053-138901-0045 BELLFIELD DID IT CHEAPER OF COURSE HE TRAVELLED SECOND CLASS I HEARD OF HIM AS I CAME ALONG THE EXPENSE DOES NOT MATTER TO YOU MISTER CHEESACRE TO THIS HE ASSENTED AND THEN TOOK HIS LEAVE
2053-138901-0046 AT FIRST OFFERING HIS HAND TO MISSUS GREENOW WITH AN AIR OF OFFENDED DIGNITY BUT FALLING BACK ALMOST INTO HUMILITY DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS ADIEU BEFORE HE WAS GONE HE HAD INVITED HER TO BRING THE CAPTAIN TO OILEYMEAD WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED
2053-138901-0047 AS HE WALKED BACK ALONG THE ROAD DON'T FORGET DEAR CHARLIE FAIRSTAIRS
2053-138901-0048 ALICE KATE CAPTAIN BELLFIELD THE SHAP BOY AND THE SHAP HORSE AND GIG WHERE IS HE KATE ASKED IN A LOW VOICE AND EVERYONE THERE FELT HOW IMPORTANT WAS THE QUESTION HE HAS GONE SAID THE WIDOW
2053-138901-0049 KATE'S SATISFACTION WAS ALMOST AS INTENSE
2053-138901-0050 I HAVE HEARD SO MUCH OF MISTER CHEESACRE BUT HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM KATE SUGGESTED THAT SHE SHOULD GET INTO THE GIG AND DRIVE AFTER HIM HE AIN'T A BEEN AND TOOK HISSELF OFF SUGGESTED THE BOY WHOSE FACE BECAME VERY DISMAL AS THE TERRIBLE IDEA STRUCK HIM
2053-138901-0051 BUT WITH JUVENILE CRAFT HE PUT HIS HAND ON THE CARPET BAG AND FINDING THAT IT DID NOT CONTAIN STONES WAS COMFORTED YOU DRIVE AFTER HIM YOUNG GENTLEMAN AND YOU'LL FIND HIM ON THE ROAD TO SHAP SAID MISSUS GREENOW MIND YOU GIVE HIM MY LOVE
2053-138901-0052 HE'LL GET HIS TURNIPS IN WELL THIS LITTLE EPISODE WENT FAR TO BREAK THE DAY
2053-138901-0053 IT CREATED A LITTLE JOINT STOCK FUND OF MERRIMENT BETWEEN THE WHOLE PARTY WHICH WAS VERY MUCH NEEDED THE ABSENCE OF SUCH JOINT STOCK FUND IS ALWAYS FELT WHEN A SMALL PARTY IS THROWN TOGETHER WITHOUT SUCH ASSISTANCE SOME BOND IS NECESSARY ON THESE OCCASIONS
2053-138901-0054 HE HAD PLENTY OF SUBJECTS FOR SMALL TALK YES INDEED OLD CHEESACRE IN SPITE OF HIS ABSURDITIES IS NOT A BAD SORT OF FELLOW AT BOTTOM AWFULLY FOND OF HIS MONEY YOU KNOW MISS VAVASOR AND ALWAYS BOASTING ABOUT IT
2053-138901-0055 NO THE MOST UNPLEASANT THING IN THE WORLD THERE'S NOTHING I HATE SO MUCH MISS VAVASOR AS THAT KIND OF TALKING MY IDEA IS THIS WHEN A MAN HAS LOTS OF MONEY LET HIM MAKE THE BEST USE HE CAN OF IT AND SAY NOTHING ABOUT IT
2053-138901-0056 NOBODY EVER HEARD ME TALKING ABOUT MY MONEY HE KNEW THAT ALICE KNEW THAT HE WAS A PAUPER BUT NEVERTHELESS HE HAD THE SATISFACTION OF SPEAKING OF HIMSELF AS THOUGH HE WERE NOT A PAUPER IN THIS WAY THE AFTERNOON WENT VERY PLEASANTLY
2053-138901-0057 FOR AN HOUR BEFORE DINNER CAPTAIN BELLFIELD WAS HAD INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND WAS TALKED TO BY HIS WIDOW ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS BUT HE HAD OF COURSE KNOWN THAT THIS WAS NECESSARY SHE SCOLDED HIM SOUNDLY
2053-138901-0058 WHEN ALL WAS COUNTED IT WAS NOT SO VERY MUCH THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS WOULD MAKE HIM A NEW MAN AND WHAT WAS SUCH A SUM AS THAT TO HIS WEALTHY WIDOW INDEED FOR A WOMAN WANTING A HUSBAND OF THAT SORT
2053-138901-0059 IT IS TRUE BELLFIELD MIGHT HAVE BEEN A FORGER OR A THIEF OR A RETURNED CONVICT BUT THEN HIS DEBTS COULD NOT BE LARGE LET HIM HAVE DONE HIS BEST
2053-138901-0060 WHEREAS NO ONE COULD TELL THE LIABILITIES OF A GENTLEMAN OF HIGH STANDING BURGO FITZGERALD WAS A GENTLEMAN OF HIGH STANDING AND HIS CREDITORS WOULD HAVE SWALLOWED UP EVERY SHILLING THAT MISSUS GREENOW POSSESSED BUT WITH CAPTAIN BELLFIELD SHE WAS COMPARATIVELY SAFE
2053-138901-0061 UPON THE WHOLE I THINK THAT SHE WAS LUCKY IN HER CHOICE OR PERHAPS I MIGHT MORE TRULY SAY THAT SHE HAD CHOSEN WITH PRUDENCE HE WAS NO FORGER OR THIEF IN THE ORDINARY SENSE OF THE WORD
2053-138901-0062 NOR WAS HE A RETURNED CONVICT HE WAS SIMPLY AN IDLE SCAMP WHO HAD HUNG ABOUT THE WORLD FOR FORTY YEARS DOING NOTHING WITHOUT PRINCIPLE SHAMELESS
2053-138901-0063 AND TO BE KICKED MORALLY KICKED
2053-138901-0064 BUT HE WAS MODERATE IN HIS GREEDINESS AND POSSESSED OF A CERTAIN APPRECIATION OF THE COMFORT OF A DAILY DINNER
2053-138901-0065 SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP THE PURSE STRINGS ALTOGETHER IN HER OWN HANDS THEREFORE I SAY THAT MISSUS GREENOW HAD BEEN LUCKY IN HER CHOICE AND NOT ALTOGETHER WITHOUT PRUDENCE I THINK OF TAKING THIS HOUSE SAID SHE AND OF LIVING HERE
2053-138901-0066 WHAT IN WESTMORELAND SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH SOMETHING OF DISMAY IN HIS TONE WHAT ON EARTH WOULD HE DO WITH HIMSELF ALL HIS LIFE IN THAT GLOOMY PLACE YES IN WESTMORELAND WHY NOT IN WESTMORELAND AS WELL AS ANYWHERE ELSE
2053-138901-0067 IF YOU DON'T LIKE WESTMORELAND IT'S NOT TOO LATE YET YOU KNOW
2053-138901-0068 I'VE BEEN TALKING TO MY NIECE ABOUT IT CONTINUED MISSUS GREENOW AND I FIND THAT SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT CAN BE MADE VERY CONVENIENTLY THE PROPERTY IS LEFT BETWEEN HER AND HER UNCLE THE FATHER OF MY OTHER NIECE AND NEITHER OF THEM WANT TO LIVE HERE
2053-138901-0069 WE COULD GO TO YARMOUTH YOU KNOW IN THE AUTUMN THEN THE CAPTAIN'S VISAGE BECAME SOMEWHAT BRIGHT AGAIN AND PERHAPS IF YOU ARE NOT EXTRAVAGANT WE COULD MANAGE A MONTH OR SO IN LONDON DURING THE WINTER JUST TO SEE THE PLAYS AND DO A LITTLE SHOPPING
2053-138901-0070 THEN THE CAPTAIN'S FACE BECAME VERY BRIGHT
2053-138901-0071 WHEN PEOPLE GROW OLD THEY MUST BE DULL DANCING CAN'T GO ON FOR EVER IN ANSWER TO THIS THE WIDOW'S CAPTAIN ASSURED THE WIDOW THAT SHE WAS NOT AT ALL OLD AND NOW ON THIS OCCASION THAT CEREMONY CAME OFF SUCCESSFULLY
2053-138901-0072 WHICH HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED ON THE SHAP ROAD BY THE NOISE OF MISTER CHEESACRE'S WHEELS
2053-138901-0073 BOTHER JEANNETTE SAID THE CAPTAIN IN HIS BLISS SHE CAN DO ANOTHER CAP AND MANY MORE WON'T BE WANTED THEN I THINK THE CEREMONY WAS REPEATED UPON THE WHOLE THE CAPTAIN'S VISIT WAS SATISFACTORY AT ANY RATE TO THE CAPTAIN
2053-138901-0074 EVERYTHING WAS SETTLED HE WAS TO GO AWAY ON SATURDAY MORNING AND REMAIN IN LODGINGS AT PENRITH TILL THE WEDDING WHICH THEY AGREED TO HAVE CELEBRATED AT VAVASOR CHURCH
2053-138901-0075 WE'LL HAVE HER AFTERWARDS SAID THE WIDOW TO KATE WHEN YOU ARE GONE AND WE SHALL WANT HER MORE AND I'LL GET CHEESACRE HERE AND MAKE HIM MARRY HER THERE'S NO GOOD IN PAYING FOR TWO JOURNEYS THE CAPTAIN WAS TO BE ALLOWED TO COME OVER FROM PENRITH TWICE A WEEK PREVIOUS TO HIS MARRIAGE
2053-138901-0076 OR PERHAPS I MIGHT MORE FAIRLY SAY THAT HE WAS COMMANDED TO DO SO I WONDER HOW HE FELT WHEN MISSUS GREENOW GAVE HIM HIS FIRST FIVE POUND NOTE AND TOLD HIM THAT HE MUST MAKE IT DO FOR A FORTNIGHT
2053-138901-0077 OR WHETHER THERE WAS ABOUT HIS HEART ANY TOUCH OF MANLY REGRET
