4948-28002-0000 TRYING TO BE A GENTLEMAN THE EFFORTS WHICH CERTAIN YOUNG MEN MAKE ON ENTERING THE WORLD TO BECOME GENTLEMEN IS NOT A LITTLE AMUSING TO SOBER THOUGHTFUL LOOKERS ON
4948-28002-0001 TO BECOME IS NOT PERHAPS WHAT IS AIMED AT SO MUCH AS TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE GENTLEMEN FOR IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO INSINUATE ANY THING TO THE CONTRARY NO MATTER HOW WIDE FROM THE MARK THEY GO
4948-28002-0002 YOU MAY EXPECT TO RECEIVE SUMMARY PUNISHMENT FOR YOUR INSOLENCE ONE OF THESE CHARACTERS MADE HIMSELF QUITE CONSPICUOUS IN BALTIMORE A FEW YEARS AGO HIS NAME WAS L AND HE HAILED FROM RICHMOND WE BELIEVE
4948-28002-0003 AND BUILT SOME CONSEQUENCE UPON THE FACT THAT HE WAS A SON OF THE OLD DOMINION HE DRESSED IN THE EXTREME OF FASHION SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME STRUTTING UP AND DOWN MARKET STREET SWITCHING HIS RATTAN BOARDED AT ONE OF THE HOTELS
4948-28002-0004 AND WAS OFTEN QUITE AS LITERAL IN HIS OBSERVANCE OF PRESCRIBING MODES AND FORMS AS WAS THE FRENCHMAN IN SHOWING OFF HIS SKILL IN OUR IDIOMS WHEN HE INFORMED A COMPANY OF LADIES AS AN EXCUSE FOR LEAVING THEM THAT HE HAD SOME FISH TO FRY
4948-28002-0005 THAT HE WAS NO GENTLEMAN INTERNALLY OR EXTERNALLY WAS PLAIN TO EVERY ONE YET HE VERILY BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST WATER AND IT WAS A MATTER OF CONSTANT CARE TO PRESERVE THE REPUTATION
4948-28002-0006 AMONG THOSE WHO WERE THROWN INTO THE SOCIETY OF THIS L WAS A YOUNG MAN NAMED BRIARLY WHO HAD RATHER MORE BASIS TO HIS CHARACTER AND WHO ALTHOUGH HE DRESSED WELL AND MOVED IN GOOD SOCIETY
4948-28002-0007 BY NO MEANS FOUNDED THEREON HIS CLAIM TO BE CALLED A GENTLEMAN HE NEVER LIKED L BECAUSE HE SAW THAT HE HAD NO PRINCIPLE WHATEVER THAT ALL ABOUT HIM WAS MERE SHAM THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT HE WAS HARDLY CIVIL TO HIM
4948-28002-0008 A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH L WAS SLOW EITHER TO NOTICE OR RESENT IT HAPPENED ONE DAY THAT THE TAILOR OF BRIARLY ASKED HIM IF HE KNEW ANY THING ABOUT L NOT MUCH REPLIED BRIARLY WHY DO YOU ASK
4948-28002-0009 DO YOU THINK HIM A GENTLEMAN HOW DO YOU ESTIMATE A GENTLEMAN ASKED THE YOUNG MAN A GENTLEMAN IS A MAN OF HONOUR RETURNED THE TAILOR VERY WELL
4948-28002-0010 THEN L MUST BE A GENTLEMAN FOR HE HAS A GREAT DEAL TO SAY ABOUT HIS HONOUR I KNOW HE HAS
4948-28002-0011 DON'T AS A GENERAL THING POSSESS MUCH TO BRAG OF THEN HE TALKS TO YOU OF HIS HONOUR OH YES AND GIVES ME HIS WORD AS A GENTLEMAN DOES HE ALWAYS KEEP HIS WORD AS A GENTLEMAN
4948-28002-0012 NOT THE WORD OF SUCH BROADCLOTH AND BUCKRAM GENTLEMEN AS HE IS TAKE CARE WHAT YOU SAY OR YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF CALLED TO ACCOUNT FOR USING IMPROPER LANGUAGE ABOUT THIS GENTLEMAN WE MAY HAVE A DUEL ON THE CARPET
4948-28002-0013 IT WOULD DEGRADE HIM TO FIGHT WITH A TAILOR REPLIED THE MAN OF SHEARS SO I MAY SPEAK MY MIND WITH IMPUNITY BUT IF HE SHOULD CHALLENGE ME I WILL REFUSE TO FIGHT HIM ON THE GROUND THAT HE IS NO GENTLEMAN
4948-28002-0014 EVERY MAN MUST BE PERMITTED TO HAVE HIS OWN STANDARD OF GENTILITY CERTAINLY I HAVE MINE AH WELL HOW DO YOU MEASURE GENTILITY BY MY LEDGER
4948-28002-0015 A MAN WHO DOESN'T PAY HIS TAILOR'S BILL I CONSIDER NO GENTLEMAN IF L SENDS ME A CHALLENGE I WILL REFUSE TO FIGHT HIM ON THAT GROUND
4948-28002-0016 I'M AFRAID IF YOUR STANDARD WERE ADOPTED THAT A GREAT MANY WHO NOW PASS THEMSELVES OFF FOR GENTLEMEN WOULD BE HELD IN LITTLE ESTIMATION IT IS THE TRUE STANDARD NEVERTHELESS REPLIED SHEARS
4948-28002-0017 A MAN MAY TRY TO BE A GENTLEMAN AS MUCH AS HE PLEASES BUT IF HE DON'T TRY TO PAY HIS TAILOR'S BILL AT THE SAME TIME HE TRIES IN VAIN YOU MAY BE RIGHT ENOUGH REMARKED BRIARLY A GOOD DEAL AMUSED AT THE TAILOR'S MODE OF ESTIMATING A GENTLEMAN
4948-28002-0018 SHORTLY AFTER THIS IT HAPPENED THAT L MADE BRIARLY ANGRY ABOUT SOMETHING WHEN THE LATTER VERY UNCEREMONIOUSLY TOOK HOLD OF THE HANDLE ON THE YOUNG MAN'S FACE AND MOVED HIS HEAD AROUND
4948-28002-0019 FORTUNATELY THE BODY MOVED WITH THE HEAD OR THE CONSEQUENCES MIGHT HAVE BEEN SERIOUS THERE WERE PLENTY TO ASSURE L THAT FOR THIS INSULT HE MUST IF HE WISHED TO BE CONSIDERED A GENTLEMAN CHALLENGE BRIARLY AND SHOOT HIM IF HE COULD
4948-28002-0020 TO ENABLE HIM TO SEND THE DEADLY MISSIVE BY THE HAND OF A FRIEND MEANTIME A WAG OF A FELLOW AN INTIMATE FRIEND OF BRIARLY'S APPEARED IN MARKET STREET IN AN OLD RUSTY COAT WORN HAT
4948-28002-0021 AND WELL MENDED BUT CLEAN AND WHOLE TROWSERS AND VEST FRIEND AFTER FRIEND STOPPED HIM AND IN ASTONISHMENT INQUIRED THE CAUSE OF THIS CHANGE HE HAD BUT ONE ANSWER IN SUBSTANCE BUT WE WILL GIVE HIS OWN ACCOUNT
4948-28002-0022 OF THE MATTER AS RELATED TO THREE OR FOUR YOUNG BUCKS IN AN OYSTER HOUSE WHERE THEY HAPPENED TO MEET HIM L WAS OF THE NUMBER A PATCH ON YOUR ELBOW TOM AS I LIVE SAID ONE AND HERE'S ANOTHER ON YOUR VEST WHY
4948-28002-0023 OLD FELLOW THIS IS PREMEDITATED POVERTY BETTER WEAR PATCHED GARMENTS THAN OWE FOR NEW ONES REPLIED TOM WITH GREAT SOBRIETY BLESS US WHEN DID YOU TURN ECONOMIST EVER SINCE I TRIED TO BE A GENTLEMAN
4948-28002-0024 WHAT EVER SINCE I TRIED TO BE A GENTLEMAN I MAY STRUT UP AND DOWN MARKET STREET IN FINE CLOTHES SWITCH MY RATTAN ABOUT TALK NONSENSE TO SILLY LADIES SWEAR AND DRINK WINE
4948-28002-0025 BUT IF I DON'T PAY MY TAILOR I'M NO GENTLEMAN NONSENSE WAS REPLIED THERE WAS A GENERAL LAUGH BUT FEW OF TOM'S AUDITORS FELT VERY MUCH FLATTERED BY HIS WORDS NO NONSENSE AT ALL HE SAID
4948-28002-0026 WE MAY PUT ON AIRS OF GENTILITY BOAST OF INDEPENDENCE AND SPIRIT AND ALL THAT BUT IT'S A MEAN KIND OF GENTILITY THAT WILL LET A MAN FLOURISH ABOUT IN A FINE COAT FOR WHICH HE OWES HIS TAILOR
4948-28002-0027 I AM TRYING TO PAY THESE OFF TRYING TO BECOME A GENTLEMAN THEN YOU DON'T CONSIDER YOURSELF A GENTLEMAN NOW SAID ONE OH NO I'M ONLY TRYING TO BECOME A GENTLEMAN MEEKLY REPLIED TOM
4948-28002-0028 THOUGH A CLOSE OBSERVER COULD SEE A SLIGHT TWITCHING IN THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH AND A SLIGHT TWINKLE IN THE CORNER OF HIS EYE MY HONOUR IS IN PAWN AND WILL REMAIN SO UNTIL I PAY THESE BILLS
4948-28002-0029 THEN I SHALL FEEL LIKE HOLDING UP MY HEAD AGAIN AND LOOKING GENTLEMEN IN THE FACE THE ODDNESS OF THIS CONCEIT AND THE BOLDNESS WITH WHICH IT WAS CARRIED OUT ATTRACTED ATTENTION AND MADE A GOOD DEAL OF TALK AT THE TIME
4948-28002-0030 A GREAT MANY TAILORS BILLS WERE PAID INSTANTER THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PAID FOR MONTHS PERHAPS NOT AT ALL IN A FEW DAYS HOWEVER TOM APPEARED ABROAD AGAIN QUITE AS HANDSOMELY DRESSED AS BEFORE
4948-28002-0031 ALLEGING THAT HIS UNCLE HAD TAKEN COMPASSION ON HIM AND OUT OF ADMIRATION FOR HIS HONEST PRINCIPLES PAID OFF HIS BILLS AND MADE A GENTLEMAN OF HIM ONCE MORE NO ONE OF COURSE BELIEVED TOM TO BE SINCERE IN ALL THIS
4948-28002-0032 IT WAS LOOKED UPON AS ONE OF HIS WAGGISH TRICKS INTENDED TO HIT OFF SOME ONE OR PERHAPS THE WHOLE CLASS OF FINE TAILOR MADE GENTLEMEN WHO FORGET THEIR BENEFACTORS WHILE TOM WAS METAMORPHOSED AS STATED
4948-28002-0033 BRIARLY WAS WAITED UPON ONE DAY BY A YOUNG MAN WHO PRESENTED HIM WITH A CHALLENGE TO MORTAL COMBAT FROM THE INSULTED L AND DESIRED HIM TO NAME HIS FRIEND I CANNOT ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE SAID BRIARLY PROMPTLY
4948-28002-0034 WHY NOT ASKED THE SECOND OF L IN SURPRISE BECAUSE YOUR PRINCIPAL IS NO GENTLEMAN WHAT IS NO GENTLEMAN COOLLY RETURNED BRIARLY EXPLAIN YOURSELF SIR IF YOU PLEASE
4948-28002-0035 HE DOESN'T PAY HIS TAILOR HE DOESN'T PAY HIS BOOT MAKER HE DOESN'T PAY HIS HATTER HE IS THEREFORE NO GENTLEMAN AND I CANNOT FIGHT HIM YOU WILL BE POSTED AS A COWARD SAID THE SECOND FIERCELY
4948-28002-0036 IN RETURN FOR WHICH I WILL POST HIM AS NO GENTLEMAN AND GIVE THE EVIDENCE REPLIED BRIARLY I WILL TAKE HIS PLACE YOU WILL HEAR FROM ME SHORTLY SAID THE SECOND TURNING AWAY BE SURE YOU DON'T OWE YOUR TAILOR ANY THING
4948-28002-0037 FOR IF YOU DO I WILL NOT STOOP TO ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE RETURNED BRIARLY I WILL CONSIDER IT PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE THAT YOU ARE NO GENTLEMAN I KNOW PATTERSON VERY WELL AND WILL IN THE MEAN TIME INFORM MYSELF ON THE SUBJECT
4948-28002-0038 ALL THIS WAS SAID WITH THE UTMOST GRAVITY AND WITH A DECISION OF TONE AND MANNER THAT LEFT NO DOUBT OF THE INTENTION THE SECOND WITHDREW AN HOUR ELAPSED BUT NO NEW CHALLENGE CAME
4948-28002-0039 DAYS WENT BY BUT NO POSTERS DREW CROWDS AT THE CORNERS GRADUALLY THE MATTER GOT WIND TO THE INFINITE AMUSEMENT OF SUCH AS HAPPENED TO KNOW L WHO WAS FAIRLY DRIVEN FROM A CITY WHERE IT WAS NO USE TRYING TO BE A GENTLEMAN
