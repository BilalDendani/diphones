1445-139387-0001 PUDD'NHEAD WILSON'S CALENDAR HABIT IS HABIT AND NOT TO BE FLUNG OUT OF THE WINDOW BY ANY MAN
1445-139387-0002 PUDD'NHEAD WILSON'S CALENDAR AT BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING THE TWINS CHARM OF MANNER AND EASY AND POLISHED BEARING
1445-139387-0003 MADE SPEEDY CONQUEST OF THE FAMILY'S GOOD GRACES ALL CONSTRAINT AND FORMALITY QUICKLY DISAPPEARED AND THE FRIENDLIEST FEELING SUCCEEDED
1445-139387-0004 AUNT PATSY CALLED THEM BY THEIR CHRISTIAN NAMES ALMOST FROM THE BEGINNING SHE WAS FULL OF THE KEENEST CURIOSITY ABOUT THEM AND SHOWED IT THEY RESPONDED BY TALKING ABOUT THEMSELVES WHICH PLEASED HER GREATLY
1445-139387-0005 IT PRESENTLY APPEARED THAT IN THEIR EARLY YOUTH THEY HAD KNOWN POVERTY AND HARDSHIP AS THE TALK WANDERED ALONG THE OLD LADY WATCHED FOR THE RIGHT PLACE TO DROP IN A QUESTION OR TWO CONCERNING THAT MATTER
1445-139387-0006 AND WHEN SHE FOUND IT SHE SAID TO THE BLOND TWIN WHO WAS NOW DOING THE BIOGRAPHIES IN HIS TURN WHILE THE BRUNETTE ONE RESTED IF IT AIN'T ASKING WHAT I OUGHT NOT TO ASK MISTER ANGELO
1445-139387-0007 IN OUR CASE IT WAS MERELY MISFORTUNE AND NOBODY'S FAULT OUR PARENTS WERE WELL TO DO THERE IN ITALY AND WE WERE THEIR ONLY CHILD WE WERE OF THE OLD FLORENTINE NOBILITY
1445-139387-0008 HIS ESTATES WERE CONFISCATED HIS PERSONAL PROPERTY SEIZED AND THERE WE WERE IN GERMANY STRANGERS FRIENDLESS AND IN FACT PAUPERS MY BROTHER AND I WERE TEN YEARS OLD
1445-139387-0009 AND WELL EDUCATED FOR THAT AGE VERY STUDIOUS VERY FOND OF OUR BOOKS AND WELL GROUNDED IN THE GERMAN FRENCH SPANISH AND ENGLISH LANGUAGES ALSO WE WERE MARVELOUS MUSICAL PRODIGIES
1445-139387-0010 IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY IT IT BEING ONLY THE TRUTH OUR FATHER SURVIVED HIS MISFORTUNES ONLY A MONTH OUR MOTHER SOON FOLLOWED HIM AND WE WERE ALONE IN THE WORLD
1445-139387-0011 OUR PARENTS COULD HAVE MADE THEMSELVES COMFORTABLE BY EXHIBITING US AS A SHOW AND THEY HAD MANY AND LARGE OFFERS BUT THE THOUGHT REVOLTED THEIR PRIDE AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD STARVE AND DIE FIRST BUT
1445-139387-0012 WHAT THEY WOULDN'T CONSENT TO DO WE HAD TO DO WITHOUT THE FORMALITY OF CONSENT WE WERE SEIZED FOR THE DEBTS OCCASIONED BY THEIR ILLNESS AND THEIR FUNERALS
1445-139387-0013 AND PLACED AMONG THE ATTRACTIONS OF A CHEAP MUSEUM IN BERLIN TO EARN THE LIQUIDATION MONEY IT TOOK US TWO YEARS TO GET OUT OF THAT SLAVERY WE TRAVELED ALL ABOUT GERMANY
1445-139387-0014 RECEIVING NO WAGES AND NOT EVEN OUR KEEP WE HAD TO BE EXHIBITED FOR NOTHING AND BEG OUR BREAD WELL MADAM THE REST IS NOT OF MUCH CONSEQUENCE
1445-139387-0015 WHEN WE ESCAPED FROM THAT SLAVERY AT TWELVE YEARS OF AGE WE WERE IN SOME RESPECTS MEN EXPERIENCE HAD TAUGHT US SOME VALUABLE THINGS
1445-139387-0016 AMONG OTHERS HOW TO TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES HOW TO AVOID AND DEFEAT SHARKS AND SHARPERS AND HOW TO CONDUCT OUR OWN BUSINESS FOR OUR OWN PROFIT AND WITHOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S HELP
1445-139387-0017 WE TRAVELED EVERYWHERE YEARS AND YEARS PICKING UP SMATTERINGS OF STRANGE TONGUES FAMILIARIZING OURSELVES WITH STRANGE SIGHTS AND STRANGE CUSTOMS
1445-139387-0018 ACCUMULATING AN EDUCATION OF A WIDE AND VARIED AND CURIOUS SORT IT WAS A PLEASANT LIFE WE WENT TO VENICE TO LONDON PARIS RUSSIA INDIA CHINA
1445-139387-0019 EN DEY'S JES A SPI'LIN TO SEE DE GEN'LEMEN SHE INDICATED THE TWINS WITH A NOD OF HER HEAD AND TUCKED IT BACK OUT OF SIGHT AGAIN IT WAS A PROUD OCCASION FOR THE WIDOW
1445-139387-0020 AND SHE PROMISED HERSELF HIGH SATISFACTION IN SHOWING OFF HER FINE FOREIGN BIRDS BEFORE HER NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS SIMPLE FOLK WHO HAD HARDLY EVER SEEN A FOREIGNER OF ANY KIND AND NEVER ONE OF ANY DISTINCTION OR STYLE
1445-139387-0021 YET HER FEELING WAS MODERATE INDEED WHEN CONTRASTED WITH ROWENA'S ROWENA WAS IN THE CLOUDS SHE WALKED ON AIR THIS WAS TO BE THE GREATEST DAY
1445-139387-0022 THE MOST ROMANTIC EPISODE IN THE COLORLESS HISTORY OF THAT DULL COUNTRY TOWN SHE WAS TO BE FAMILIARLY NEAR THE SOURCE OF ITS GLORY AND FEEL THE FULL FLOOD OF IT POUR OVER HER AND ABOUT HER
1445-139387-0023 THE OTHER GIRLS COULD ONLY GAZE AND ENVY NOT PARTAKE THE WIDOW WAS READY ROWENA WAS READY SO ALSO WERE THE FOREIGNERS
1445-139387-0024 THE PARTY MOVED ALONG THE HALL THE TWINS IN ADVANCE AND ENTERED THE OPEN PARLOR DOOR WHENCE ISSUED A LOW HUM OF CONVERSATION THE TWINS TOOK A POSITION NEAR THE DOOR
1445-139387-0025 THE WIDOW STOOD AT LUIGI'S SIDE ROWENA STOOD BESIDE ANGELO AND THE MARCH PAST AND THE INTRODUCTIONS BEGAN THE WIDOW WAS ALL SMILES AND CONTENTMENT
1445-139387-0026 SHE RECEIVED THE PROCESSION AND PASSED IT ON TO ROWENA GOOD MORNIN SISTER COOPER HANDSHAKE GOOD MORNING BROTHER HIGGINS COUNT LUIGI CAPELLO
1445-139387-0027 MISTER HIGGINS HANDSHAKE FOLLOWED BY A DEVOURING STARE AND I'M GLAD TO SEE YE ON THE PART OF HIGGINS AND A COURTEOUS INCLINATION OF THE HEAD AND A PLEASANT MOST HAPPY
1445-139387-0028 MOST HAPPY AND HIGGINS PASSES ON NONE OF THESE VISITORS WAS AT EASE BUT BEING HONEST PEOPLE THEY DIDN'T PRETEND TO BE
1445-139387-0029 NONE OF THEM HAD EVER SEEN A PERSON BEARING A TITLE OF NOBILITY BEFORE AND NONE HAD BEEN EXPECTING TO SEE ONE NOW
1445-139387-0030 CONSEQUENTLY THE TITLE CAME UPON THEM AS A KIND OF PILE DRIVING SURPRISE AND CAUGHT THEM UNPREPARED A FEW TRIED TO RISE TO THE EMERGENCY AND GOT OUT AN AWKWARD MY LORD OR
1445-139387-0031 AND STATELY CEREMONY AND ANOINTED KINGSHIP SO THEY ONLY FUMBLED THROUGH THE HANDSHAKE AND PASSED ON SPEECHLESS NOW AND THEN AS HAPPENS AT ALL RECEPTIONS EVERYWHERE
1445-139387-0032 A MORE THAN ORDINARY FRIENDLY SOUL BLOCKED THE PROCESSION AND KEPT IT WAITING WHILE HE INQUIRED HOW THE BROTHERS LIKED THE VILLAGE AND HOW LONG THEY WERE GOING TO STAY AND IF THEIR FAMILY WAS WELL
1445-139387-0033 AND THE TWINS DRIFTED ABOUT FROM GROUP TO GROUP TALKING EASILY AND FLUENTLY AND WINNING APPROVAL COMPELLING ADMIRATION AND ACHIEVING FAVOR FROM ALL
1445-139387-0034 THE WIDOW FOLLOWED THEIR CONQUERING MARCH WITH A PROUD EYE AND EVERY NOW AND THEN ROWENA SAID TO HERSELF WITH DEEP SATISFACTION AND TO THINK THEY ARE OURS ALL OURS
1445-139387-0035 THERE WERE NO IDLE MOMENTS FOR MOTHER OR DAUGHTER EAGER INQUIRIES CONCERNING THE TWINS WERE POURING INTO THEIR ENCHANTED EARS ALL THE TIME
1445-139387-0036 EACH WAS THE CONSTANT CENTER OF A GROUP OF BREATHLESS LISTENERS EACH RECOGNIZED THAT SHE KNEW NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THE REAL MEANING OF THAT GREAT WORD GLORY
1445-139387-0037 AND PERCEIVED THE STUPENDOUS VALUE OF IT AND UNDERSTOOD WHY MEN IN ALL AGES HAD BEEN WILLING TO THROW AWAY MEANER HAPPINESS TREASURE LIFE ITSELF
1445-139387-0038 TO GET A TASTE OF ITS SUBLIME AND SUPREME JOY NAPOLEON AND ALL HIS KIND STOOD ACCOUNTED FOR AND JUSTIFIED WHEN ROWENA
1445-139387-0039 HAD AT LAST DONE ALL HER DUTY BY THE PEOPLE IN THE PARLOR SHE WENT UPSTAIRS TO SATISFY THE LONGINGS OF AN OVERFLOW MEETING THERE FOR THE PARLOR WAS NOT BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD ALL THE COMERS
1445-139387-0040 AGAIN SHE WAS BESIEGED BY EAGER QUESTIONERS AND AGAIN SHE SWAM IN SUNSET SEAS OF GLORY WHEN THE FORENOON WAS NEARLY GONE SHE RECOGNIZED WITH A PANG THAT
1445-139387-0041 THIS MOST SPLENDID EPISODE OF HER LIFE WAS ALMOST OVER THAT NOTHING COULD PROLONG IT THAT NOTHING QUITE ITS EQUAL COULD EVER FALL TO HER FORTUNE AGAIN BUT NEVER MIND
1445-139387-0042 IT WAS SUFFICIENT UNTO ITSELF THE GRAND OCCASION HAD MOVED ON AN ASCENDING SCALE FROM THE START AND WAS A NOBLE AND MEMORABLE SUCCESS IF THE TWINS
1445-139387-0043 COULD BUT DO SOME CROWNING ACT NOW TO CLIMAX IT SOMETHING
1445-139387-0044 SOMETHING STARTLING SOMETHING TO CONCENTRATE UPON THEMSELVES THE COMPANY'S LOFTIEST ADMIRATION SOMETHING IN THE NATURE OF AN ELECTRIC SURPRISE HERE
1445-139387-0045 IT WAS THE TWINS KNOCKING OUT A CLASSIC FOUR HANDED PIECE ON THE PIANO IN GREAT STYLE ROWENA WAS SATISFIED SATISFIED
1445-139387-0046 DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF HER HEART THE YOUNG STRANGERS WERE KEPT LONG AT THE PIANO THE VILLAGERS WERE ASTONISHED AND ENCHANTED WITH THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THEIR PERFORMANCE
1445-139387-0047 WHEN COMPARED WITH THESE INTOXICATING FLOODS OF MELODIOUS SOUND THEY REALIZED THAT FOR ONCE IN THEIR LIVES
