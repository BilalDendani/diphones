7946-111913-0000 ABOUT A CAMEL AND A THIEF IT IS A TRUE STORY AND HAPPENED MANY MANY YEARS AGO
7946-111913-0001 ONCE UPON A TIME A TRAVELER WAS GOING ON FOOT ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN HIS BELT HE HAD A PURSE FULL OF MONEY ONE DAY AS THE SUN BEGAN TO GET HOT HE LAY DOWN ON THE GRASS UNDER A TREE NEAR THE ROADWAY AND FELL ASLEEP
7946-111913-0002 AFTER A FEW HOURS HE WOKE UP AND WHAT WAS HIS SURPRISE TO FIND THAT THE PURSE WAS GONE
7946-111913-0003 SOMEBODY HAD QUIETLY STOLEN HIS PURSE AND GONE AWAY THE TRAVELER RAN TO THE NEAREST VILLAGE AND THERE TOLD THE POLICE ABOUT IT NOW AMONG THE POLICE THERE WAS A VERY CLEVER MAN
7946-111913-0004 AND THE POLICE BROUGHT HIM WITH THEM TO THE PLACE WHERE THE MONEY HAD BEEN STOLEN THE CLEVER MAN LOOKED ALL AROUND THE PLACE VERY CAREFULLY TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND ANY MARKS ON THE GROUND
7946-111913-0005 ON THE GRASS NEAR THE TREE HE FOUND NO MARKS IN FACT IF A PERSON WALKS ON THE GRASS JUST ONCE OR TWICE IT DOES NOT LEAVE ANY MARK
7946-111913-0006 HE FOUND FOOTPRINTS THEY ARE A CAMEL'S FOOTPRINTS HE SAID LOOKING AT THE MARKS CAREFULLY
7946-111913-0007 THREE OF THEM ARE QUITE DEEP AND CLEAR BUT THE FOURTH ONE IS VERY FAINT HE FOLLOWED THE CAMEL'S FOOTPRINTS ALONG THE ROAD FOR A LONG TIME
7946-111913-0008 BUT NOW AND AGAIN HE STOPPED AND LOOKED AT THE SHRUBS AND BUSHES WHICH GREW HERE AND THERE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD HELLO THAT IS STRANGE HE SUDDENLY SAID
7946-111913-0009 THE CAMEL HAS EATEN FROM THE BUSHES AND SHRUBS HERE AND THERE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD BUT HE HASN'T EATEN AT ALL FROM THOSE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD HE WENT ON FOR SOME TIME LONGER
7946-111913-0010 THEN SUDDENLY STOPPED TO LOOK AT THE ROAD WHERE THE CAMEL HAD WALKED HELLO THIS IS ALSO STRANGE HE SAID HERE ARE A LOT OF BEES BUZZING NEAR THE GROUND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD
7946-111913-0011 AND HERE ARE A LOT OF ANTS SCRAMBLING OVER THE GROUND ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD
7946-111913-0012 WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE THIEF WHO STOLE THE MONEY YOU HAVE NOT FOUND ANY OTHER FOOTPRINTS EXCEPT THE CAMEL'S THAT IS QUITE TRUE THE CLEVER MAN SAID
7946-111913-0013 BUT AS THE CAMEL COULD NOT STEAL THE MONEY THERE MUST BE A MAN RIDING ON THE CAMEL HE MUST BE THE THIEF BUT WHY DIDN'T THE THIEF LEAVE ANY FOOTPRINTS
7946-111913-0014 BECAUSE HE MUST HAVE RIDDEN HIS CAMEL FROM THE ROADWAY RIGHT TO THE EDGE OF THE GRASS THE CLEVER MAN ANSWERED THEN HE MUST HAVE
7946-111913-0015 JUMPED DOWN UPON THE GRASS WHERE HE KNEW HE WOULD NOT LEAVE ANY FOOTPRINT HE MUST HAVE WALKED VERY QUIETLY ON THE GRASS UP TO THE TREE WHERE THE TRAVELER WAS SLEEPING AND STOLEN THE MONEY
7946-111913-0016 HOW CAN WE FIND HIM IF YOU DO NOT TELL US WHAT HE IS LIKE I CANNOT TELL YOU A THING ABOUT THE THIEF
7946-111913-0017 THE CLEVER MAN ANSWERED BUT I CAN TELL YOU ALL ABOUT THE CAMEL THE CAMEL IS BLIND IN HIS RIGHT EYE AND LAME IN HIS LEFT HIND FOOT
7946-111913-0018 THE PACKAGE ON THE RIGHT SIDE HAS HONEY IN IT AND THE PACKAGE ON THE LEFT SIDE HAS CORN IN IT SO YOU MUST SEARCH FOR A MAN WHO IS RIDING A CAMEL LOADED LIKE THAT HE IS THE THIEF
7946-111913-0019 SO THE POLICE SEARCHED FOR A MAN WHO WAS RIDING A CAMEL WHICH WAS BLIND IN HIS RIGHT EYE LAME IN HIS LEFT HIND FOOT AND CARRYING HONEY IN A PACKAGE ON HIS RIGHT SIDE AND CORN IN A PACKAGE ON HIS LEFT SIDE
7946-111913-0020 AFTER FOLLOWING THE CAMEL'S FOOTPRINTS ON THE GROUND FOR A LONG TIME THE POLICE AT LAST CAME TO A VILLAGE THEY SEARCHED THROUGH THE VILLAGE AND FOUND MANY MEN RIDING CAMELS
7946-111913-0021 BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE MAN RIDING A CAMEL BLIND IN HIS RIGHT EYE LAME IN LEFT HIND FOOT AND CARRYING HONEY ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND CORN ON THE LEFT SIDE SO THE POLICE KNEW THAT HE WAS THE THIEF
7946-111913-0022 AND TOOK HIM BEFORE THE JUDGE THEN THE THIEF SAID THAT IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT HE STOLE THE MONEY AFTERWARDS THE JUDGE TURNED TO THE CLEVER MAN AND ASKED HIM
7946-111913-0023 THE CLEVER MAN ANSWERED VERY MODESTLY FIRST ABOUT THE CAMEL BEING BLIND IN HIS RIGHT EYE HE HAD NIBBLED AT THE SHRUBS AND BUSHES GROWING ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD
7946-111913-0024 ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD THERE WERE ALSO PLENTY OF GOOD SHRUBS AND BUSHES BUT THE CAMEL HAD NOT TAKEN A SINGLE BITE AT ANY OF THEM THAT SHOWED THAT HE DID NOT EVEN SEE THOSE SHRUBS AND BUSHES ON HIS RIGHT SIDE
7946-111913-0025 THAT IS VERY CLEVER OF YOU THE JUDGE SAID
7946-111913-0026 IN HIS LEFT HIND FOOT
7946-111913-0027 AS THE CAMEL WALKED ALONG THE MARKS OF HIS TWO FRONT FEET AND RIGHT HIND FOOT WERE QUITE DEEP AND CLEAR ON THE GROUND BUT THE MARK OF HIS LEFT HIND FOOT WAS VERY FAINT
7946-111913-0028 THAT SHOWED THAT THE CAMEL WAS LIMPING AND THE LEFT HIND FOOT ONLY JUST TOUCHED THE GROUND SO I KNEW THAT HE WAS LAME IN THAT FOOT THAT IS ALSO VERY CLEVER OF YOU THE JUDGE SAID
7946-111913-0029 THAT WAS THE SIMPLEST OF ALL
7946-111913-0030 NEARLY EVERY STEP HE TOOK JERKED THE LOAD ON HIS BACK
7946-111913-0031 AND A FEW GRAINS OF THE CORN FELL TO THE GROUND FROM THE PACKAGE ON HIS LEFT SIDE BUT YOU COULD NOT SEE VERY WELL HERE AND THERE ON THE GROUND JUST A FEW DROPS OF HONEY OR
7946-111913-0032 I COULD NOT THE CLEVER MAN ANSWERED
7946-111913-0033 ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD I FOUND A SWARM OF BEES HERE AND THERE SO I KNEW THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO PICK UP THE HONEY AND ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD I SAW A WHOLE LOT OF ANTS HERE AND THERE
7946-111913-0034 SO I KNEW THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO PICK UP AND CARRY AWAY THE GRAINS OF CORN NOW WAS IT NOT REALLY CLEVER OF THAT MAN TO FIND ALL THAT OUT ABOUT THE CAMEL WITHOUT EVER SEEING THE CAMEL BEFORE
