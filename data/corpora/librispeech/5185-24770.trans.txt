5185-24770-0000 IT IS NECESSARILY GOOD PROOF IN SO FAR AS A THING IS IN HARMONY WITH OUR NATURE IT CANNOT BE BAD FOR IT IT WILL THEREFORE NECESSARILY BE EITHER GOOD OR INDIFFERENT
5185-24770-0001 IF IT BE ASSUMED THAT IT BE NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD NOTHING WILL FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE
5185-24770-0002 THAT IS BY THE HYPOTHESIS WHICH TENDS TO THE PRESERVATION OF THE THING ITSELF BUT THIS
5185-24770-0003 THEREFORE IN SO FAR AS A THING IS IN HARMONY WITH OUR NATURE IT IS NECESSARILY GOOD
5185-24770-0004 COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT IN PROPORTION AS A THING IS IN HARMONY WITH OUR NATURE SO IS IT MORE USEFUL OR BETTER FOR US AND VICE VERSA IN PROPORTION AS A THING IS MORE USEFUL FOR US
5185-24770-0005 SO IS IT MORE IN HARMONY WITH OUR NATURE FOR IN SO FAR AS IT IS NOT IN HARMONY WITH OUR NATURE IT WILL NECESSARILY BE DIFFERENT THEREFROM
5185-24770-0006 BE SAID TO BE NATURALLY IN HARMONY PROOF THINGS WHICH ARE SAID TO BE IN HARMONY NATURALLY ARE UNDERSTOOD TO AGREE IN POWER
5185-24770-0007 OR NEGATION AND CONSEQUENTLY NOT IN PASSION
5185-24770-0008 WHEREFORE MEN IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE A PREY TO THEIR PASSIONS CANNOT BE SAID TO BE NATURALLY IN HARMONY
5185-24770-0009 NOTE THIS IS ALSO SELF EVIDENT FOR IF WE SAY THAT WHITE AND BLACK ONLY AGREE IN THE FACT THAT NEITHER IS RED WE ABSOLUTELY AFFIRM THAT THE DO NOT AGREE IN ANY RESPECT
5185-24770-0010 SO IF WE SAY THAT A MAN AND A STONE ONLY AGREE IN THE FACT THAT BOTH ARE FINITE WANTING IN POWER NOT EXISTING BY THE NECESSITY OF THEIR OWN NATURE OR LASTLY INDEFINITELY SURPASSED BY THE POWER OF EXTERNAL CAUSES
5185-24770-0011 CANNOT BE EXPLAINED SOLELY THROUGH OUR ESSENCE OR NATURE
5185-24770-0012 BY THE NATURE OF EXTERNAL CAUSES IN COMPARISON WITH OUR OWN HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT THERE ARE AS MANY KINDS OF EACH EMOTION AS THERE ARE EXTERNAL OBJECTS WHEREBY WE ARE AFFECTED
5185-24770-0013 AND THAT MEN MAY BE DIFFERENTLY AFFECTED BY ONE AND THE SAME OBJECT
5185-24770-0014 PROOF A MAN FOR INSTANCE PETER CAN BE THE CAUSE OF PAUL'S FEELING PAIN BECAUSE HE PETER POSSESSES SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH PAUL HATES
5185-24770-0015 OR BECAUSE PETER HAS SOLE POSSESSION OF A THING WHICH PAUL ALSO LOVES
5185-24770-0016 NOTE I SAID THAT PAUL MAY HATE PETER BECAUSE HE CONCEIVES THAT PETER POSSESSES SOMETHING WHICH HE PAUL
5185-24770-0017 WE SHALL SEE THAT THE DISCREPANCY VANISHES FOR THE TWO MEN ARE NOT IN ONE ANOTHER'S WAY IN VIRTUE OF THE AGREEMENT OF THEIR NATURES THAT IS THROUGH BOTH LOVING THE SAME THING BUT IN VIRTUE OF ONE DIFFERING FROM THE OTHER
5185-24770-0018 FOR IN SO FAR AS EACH LOVES THE SAME THING THE LOVE OF EACH IS FOSTERED THEREBY
5185-24770-0019 THE PLEASURE OF EACH IS FOSTERED THEREBY WHEREFORE IT IS FAR FROM BEING THE CASE THAT THEY ARE AT VARIANCE THROUGH BOTH LOVING THE SAME THING AND THROUGH THE AGREEMENT IN THEIR NATURES
5185-24770-0020 THE CAUSE FOR THEIR OPPOSITION LIES AS I HAVE SAID SOLELY IN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ASSUMED TO DIFFER FOR WE ASSUME THAT PETER HAS THE IDEA OF THE LOVED OBJECT AS ALREADY IN HIS POSSESSION
5185-24770-0021 WHILE PAUL HAS THE IDEA OF THE LOVED OBJECT AS LOST HENCE THE ONE MAN WILL BE AFFECTED WITH PLEASURE THE OTHER WILL BE AFFECTED WITH PAIN
5185-24770-0022 IN SO FAR AS THEY ACT IN OBEDIENCE TO REASON
5185-24770-0023 THEREFORE WHAT SO EVER FOLLOWS FROM HUMAN NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS DEFINED BY REASON MUST
5185-24770-0024 BE UNDERSTOOD SOLELY THROUGH HUMAN NATURE AS ITS PROXIMATE CAUSE BUT SINCE EVERY MAN BY THE LAWS OF HIS NATURE DESIRES THAT WHICH HE DEEMS GOOD AND ENDEAVOURS TO REMOVE THAT WHICH HE DEEMS BAD
5185-24770-0025 AND FURTHER SINCE THAT WHICH WE IN ACCORDANCE WITH REASON DEEM GOOD OR BAD NECESSARILY IS GOOD OR BAD
5185-24770-0026 NECESSARILY DO ONLY SUCH THINGS
5185-24770-0027 MEN WILL BE MOST USEFUL ONE TO ANOTHER WHEN EACH SEEKS MOST THAT WHICH IS USEFUL TO HIM
5185-24770-0028 NOTE WHAT WE HAVE JUST SHOWN IS ATTESTED BY EXPERIENCE SO CONSPICUOUSLY THAT IT IS IN THE MOUTH OF NEARLY EVERYONE MAN IS TO MAN A GOD
5185-24770-0029 THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY ENVIOUS AND TROUBLESOME ONE TO ANOTHER NEVERTHELESS THEY ARE SCARCELY ABLE TO LEAD A SOLITARY LIFE
5185-24770-0030 HAS MET WITH GENERAL ASSENT IN FACT MEN DO DERIVE FROM SOCIAL LIFE MUCH MORE CONVENIENCE THAN INJURY
5185-24770-0031 LET THEOLOGIANS RAIL AND LET MISANTHROPES PRAISE TO THEIR UTMOST THE LIFE OF UNTUTORED RUSTICITY LET THEM HEAP CONTEMPT ON MEN AND PRAISES ON BEASTS WHEN ALL IS SAID THEY WILL FIND THAT MEN CAN PROVIDE FOR THEIR WANTS
5185-24770-0032 MUCH MORE EASILY BY MUTUAL HELP AND THAT ONLY BY UNITING THEIR FORCES CAN THEY ESCAPE FROM THE DANGERS THAT ON EVERY SIDE BESET THEM
