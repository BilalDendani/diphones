5043-28401-0000 AN ESSAY ON MATRIMONY SOCRATES BEING ASKED WHETHER IT WERE BETTER FOR A MAN TO MARRY OR TO REMAIN SINGLE REPLIED LET HIM DO EITHER HE WILL REPENT OF IT
5043-28401-0001 THE PHILOSOPHER SPOKE LIKE AN ORACLE LEAVING THE WORLD AS MUCH IN THE DARK AS TO HIS VIEWS OF THE COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES OF MATRIMONY AND CELIBACY AS THEY COULD HAVE BEEN BEFORE
5043-28401-0002 BUT A VAST MAJORITY OF MEN HAVE CHOSEN SINCE THEY MUST REPENT OF ONE OR THE OTHER TO REPENT OF MARRYING DEEMING PERHAPS THAT THIS REPENTANCE IS THE REPENTANCE
5043-28401-0003 WHICH NEEDETH NOT TO BE REPENTED OF WE SHALL CONCLUDE OUR LITTLE TREATISE ON THE SEX WITH A FEW REMARKS ON THE SUBJECT OF WE WERE ABOUT TO SAY HAPPINESS BUT AS WE ARE CONTENT THAT EVERY MARRIED MAN AND WOMAN
5043-28401-0004 WE WILL SIMPLY STYLE IT AN ESSAY ON MATRIMONY NO EVENT IS MORE IMPORTANT AND NONE IS CONDUCTED ON MANY OCCASIONS WITH LESS PRUDENCE THAN MARRIAGE
5043-28401-0005 PROVIDENCE HAS ALLOWED THE PASSIONS TO EXERCISE A POWERFUL INFLUENCE IN THIS MATTER OTHERWISE THE CARES AND ANXIETIES WITH WHICH IT IS ATTENDED WOULD DETER MOST PERSONS
5043-28401-0006 FROM LAUNCHING THEIR BARK OF EARTHLY HAPPINESS ON THE GREAT OCEAN OF MATRIMONY BUT TOO FREQUENTLY THE PASSIONS ARE THE ONLY GUIDE AND THESE STIMULATE TO BEWILDER
5043-28401-0007 THEY EXHIBIT PLEASING AND ATTRACTIVE IMAGERY AND THEN THE POSSESSION DESTROYS THE BLISS LOVE IS A PLEASING BUT EXCITING PASSION THE EYE IS DELIGHTED
5043-28401-0008 BY FORM MANNERS AND THE EXPRESSION OF THE FEATURES THE EARS BY MUSICAL LANGUAGE AND THE IMAGINATION PAINTS FUTURE JOYS ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO ONE GREAT PRINCIPLE
5043-28401-0009 THAT OF RECEIVING HAPPINESS FROM THOSE WE LOVE AND EVINCING LOVE FOR THOSE FROM WHOM WE DERIVE OUR HAPPINESS AS THE CRYSTAL STREAMS ARE ABSORBED BY THE SUN
5043-28401-0010 AND DISTRIBUTED AS BRILLIANT CLOUDS IN THE HEAVENS AND THEN FALL AND RUN IN THEIR ACCUSTOMED CHANNELS AND THUS THE RIVERS SUPPLY THE CLOUDS AND THE VAPORS THE RIVERS SO IS THE INTERCHANGE BETWEEN LOVE AND HAPPINESS
5043-28401-0011 THIS WILL AGREE WITH THE OPINION THAT LOVE MAY BE OCCASIONED SUDDENLY BECAUSE ENJOYMENT IS EXPECTED OR IT MAY ARISE GRADUALLY BECAUSE THE UNATTRACTIVENESS WHICH FIRST EXISTED
5043-28401-0012 AND ASTONISHING COINCIDENCES HUMAN BEINGS APPEAR TO BE LEFT IN THIS RESPECT AS IN MANY OTHERS TO THEIR OWN JUDGMENT IF THEY ACT DISCREETLY THEY ENJOY THE COMFORT OF IT
5043-28401-0013 BUT IF OTHERWISE THEY BRING UPON THEMSELVES A DISADVANTAGE THE HAPPINESS ARISING FROM AN UNION DEPENDS CHIEFLY ON THE CHARACTER OF THE PERSONS WHO ARE CONCERNED IN IT IF
5043-28401-0014 MEN AND WOMEN WERE AS CONSISTENT AND VIRTUOUS AS THEY SHOULD BE THE CONNUBIAL BOND WOULD BE SOFT AND PLEASANT BUT AS THESE EFFECTS DO NOT ALWAYS ARISE WHERE IS THE FAULT
5043-28401-0015 WHICH IS BETTER OR MORE WORTHY THE MALE OR THE FEMALE SEX THIS IS RATHER A DIFFICULT QUESTION AND LET THE PALM OF SUPERIOR MERIT BE AWARDED TO EITHER THE IMPUTATION OF PREJUDICE WOULD BE CONNECTED WITH THE DECISION
5043-28401-0016 BUT FORTUNATELY THERE IS LITTLE DIFFERENCE ONE VARIES FROM THE OTHER IN PARTICULAR QUALITIES BUT IF THE AGGREGATE OF MERIT BE TAKEN IN EACH THE AMOUNT WILL NOT DIFFER MUCH EDUCATION FORMS THE PRINCIPAL VARIATION
5043-28401-0017 MEN ARE INSTRUCTED IN THE MORE ACTIVE AND LABORIOUS EMPLOYMENTS WOMEN IN THE MORE SEDENTARY AND DOMESTIC DOCTOR SOUTHEY SAYS THAT IF WOMEN ARE NOT FORMED OF FINER CLAY
5043-28401-0018 RICHARD FLECKNOE A CONTEMPORARY WITH DRYDEN OBSERVES OF THE FEMALE SEX I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONVERSANT WITH THE BEST AND WORTHIEST IN ALL PLACES WHERE I CAME AND AMONG THE REST WITH LADIES
5043-28401-0019 IN WHOSE CONVERSATION AS IN AN ACADEMY OF VIRTUE I LEARNT NOTHING BUT GOODNESS AND SAW NOTHING BUT NOBLENESS IT MUST BE GRANTED THAT WOMEN IN GENERAL POSSESS MORE OF THE SWEETNESS AND SOFTNESS OF HUMAN NATURE
5043-28401-0020 WHILE MEN ARE ENDOWED WITH MORE VIGOROUS VIRTUES WOMEN ARE GIFTED WITH MORE FORTITUDE AND MEN WITH MORE VALOR JEREMY TAYLOR SAYS MARRIAGE HATH IN IT THE LABOR OF LOVE AND THE DELICACIES OF FRIENDSHIP
5043-28401-0021 THE BLESSINGS OF SOCIETY AND THE UNION OF HANDS AND HEARTS COWPER HAS ALSO ALLUDED TO THE ADVANTAGES OF A MATRIMONIAL SETTLEMENT O FRIENDLY TO THE BEST PURSUITS OF MAN
5043-28401-0022 FRIENDLY TO THOUGHT TO VIRTUE AND TO PEACE
5043-28401-0023 A CONTINUANCE OF THE UNION CONSTITUTES NO SMALL PART OF THE BLISS THE EXPECTATION OF A DURABLE CONNECTION MAKES MEN CAREFUL OTHERWISE THEY WOULD MARRY AND UNMARRY EVERY WEEK THERE IS BY THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ALMIGHTY
5043-28401-0024 A COMPARATIVE POWER OR INFLUENCE VESTED IN THE MAN BECAUSE AGREEABLY WITH ALL GOOD GOVERNMENT SOME ARE AND MUST BE GREATER THAN THE REST BUT THEN AS DOCTOR BEATTIE OBSERVES
5043-28401-0025 HAS THE ACTUAL POWER LIKE AS THE HELME DOTH RULE THE SHIPPE SO SHE REGULATES ALL THE HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS THIS IS PROPER WHEN THE HUSBAND ALLOWS IT AND HE OUGHT TO DO SO WHEN HIS WIFE
5043-28401-0026 IS CAPABLE OF MANAGING THESE THINGS BUT WHEN THE INCLINATIONS OF HIS EVE RUN PERVERSELY WHEN HE IS CONSCIOUS THAT HE HAS REASON ON HIS SIDE AND SHE ONLY FOLLY AND YET HE IS VACILLATING AND YIELDING HE IS UNMANLY AND INCONSISTENT
5043-28401-0027 HE SACRIFICES FUTURE HAPPINESS TO PRESENT PEACE EVERY WOMAN IT MUST BE GRANTED IS NOT A SENSIBLE ONE
5043-28401-0028 THAN A SHE FOOLE IF SOCRATES
5043-28401-0029 IT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO HER HAPPINESS AND HIS OWN PRINCE EUGENE OBSERVED ON ONE OCCASION RATHER SATIRICALLY THAT LOVE WAS A MERE AMUSEMENT AND CALCULATED FOR NOTHING MORE
5043-28401-0030 THAN TO ENLARGE THE INFLUENCE OF THE WOMAN AND ABRIDGE THE POWER OF THE MAN GOLDSMITH'S HERMIT
5043-28401-0031 AND LOVE IS STILL AN EMPTIER SOUND THE MODERN FAIR ONE'S JEST ON EARTH UNSEEN OR ONLY FOUND TO WARM THE TURTLE'S NEST BUT LOVE IS AN ACTUAL A POWERFUL
5043-28401-0032 AND A BENEFICIAL PRINCIPLE IF IT BE PROPERLY REGULATED
5043-28401-0033 MATRIMONY SHOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THE UNION OF THE IVY AND THE OAK THE LATTER IS FIRM AND CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING ITS MORE TENDER COMPANION THE IVY HOWEVER MUST FOLLOW IN SOME MEASURE THE HUMORS AND WINDINGS OF THE OAK
5043-28401-0034 BUT THEY GROW TOGETHER AND THE LONGER THEY CONTINUE THE MORE CLOSELY THEY ARE UNITED THERE HAVE BEEN MANY INSTANCES OF GREAT ATTACHMENT PORCIA THE WIFE OF BRUTUS
5043-28401-0035 SWALLOWED BURNING COALS THAT SHE MIGHT GO WITH HIM
5043-28401-0036 SACRIFICED HERSELF FOR THE SAFETY OF HER HUSBAND THIS MONARCH WAS ILL AND WHEN THE ORACLE WAS CONSULTED IT WAS DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NOT RECOVER EXCEPT SOME FRIEND WOULD DIE FOR HIM
5043-28401-0037 THE WIFE HEROICALLY DRANK A CUP OF POISON PAULINA THE WIFE OF SENECA IN HIS OLD AGE WAS YOUNG BEAUTIFUL AND ACCOMPLISHED
5043-28401-0038 THAT WHEN THE VEINS OF SENECA WERE OPENED BY THE COMMAND OF NERO SHE CAUSED HER OWN TO BE CUT THAT SHE MIGHT ALSO BLEED TO DEATH
5043-28401-0039 WHEN PROFESSIONS ARE SINCERE AND THE PRACTICE AGREEABLE THEREWITH WHEN HEALTH IS ENJOYED AND AS MANY COMFORTS AS ARE NECESSARY FOR THIS LIFE WHEN CHILDREN GROW UP IN VIGOR GOOD BEHAVIOUR AND MENTAL IMPROVEMENT
5043-28401-0040 WHEN OLD AGE IS SOLACED BY THE COMPANY OF EACH OTHER AND THE KIND ATTENTION OF DAUGHTERS AND SONS THEN MATRIMONY IS A CAUSE OF HAPPINESS BUT IF ALL THESE ENJOYMENTS WERE THE LOT OF EVERY MARRIED PERSON
5043-28401-0041 MEN WOULD BECOME TOO MUCH CONTENTED WITH THE PRESENT LIFE AND THEY WOULD SCARCELY THINK AS THEY SAIL ON SMOOTHLY OF THE HAVEN FOR WHICH THEY ARE BOUND BESIDES
5043-28401-0042 THE FASCINATIONS OF DOMESTIC LIFE WOULD ATTRACT THEM FROM MANY DUTIES WHICH THEY OWE TO THEIR FELLOW CREATURES THERE ARE THEN MANY DISADVANTAGES CONNECTED WITH MATRIMONY THERE IS SO MUCH IGNORANCE PERVERSENESS UNDUE INCLINATION FOR POWER
5043-28401-0043 DISPOSITION TO CONTRADICT ANGER JEALOUSY HATRED AND VERSATILITY AMONG HUMAN BEINGS THAT MANY UNPLEASANT OCCURRENCES WILL NECESSARILY ARISE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MARRIAGE STATE BECAUSE HERE
5043-28401-0044 MOST OF THESE FEELINGS ARE BROUGHT INTO ACTION AND ARE MOST SENSIBLY FELT BY THOSE WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THEIR INFLUENCE HE THAT PAINTS THE EXPERIENCE OF HUMAN LIFE IN BRILLIANT COLORS ONLY GIVES A FLATTERING
5043-28401-0045 HENCE ARISES THE ADVANTAGE OF EXAMINING OF POINTING OUT AND ENDEAVORING TO AVOID THE ILLS WHICH FLESH IS HEIR TO THE PERPETUITY OF MARRIAGE UNDER PLEASING CIRCUMSTANCES
5043-28401-0046 IS ITS MOST LOVELY CHARACTER BUT THE SAME PECULIARITY UNDER A DIFFERENT ASPECT IS ITS PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF MISERY IT IS TOO FREQUENTLY A STATE OF BONDAGE WHICH THOUSANDS ONCE FAST CHAINED TO QUIT NO MORE
5043-28401-0047 BUT WHAT EXISTS AND CANNOT BE REMOVED SHOULD ALWAYS BE BORNE AS PATIENTLY AS POSSIBLE AND THUS WE MAY KEEP A CHEERFUL HEART WHEN ANOTHER LESS PRUDENT WOULD BE GLOOMY BESIDES AN ILL TEMPER
5043-28401-0048 MAKES EVERY CONDITION OF LIFE UNHAPPY A CHEERFUL DISPOSITION WILL THROW A GLEAM OF SUNSHINE OVER THE SCENERY OF A NOVEMBER DAY SOME PEOPLE VERY FOOLISHLY MAKE THEMSELVES UNEASY BECAUSE THEY ARE BOUND
5043-28401-0049 AND THIS WE MAY HOPE WOULD NOT OCCUR FREQUENTLY AFTER THE ROMANS HAD INTRODUCED A LAW OF DIVORCE NO RESPECTABLE PERSON FOR THE SPACE OF FORTY YEARS AVAILED HIMSELF OF IT
5043-28401-0050 DIVORCEMENT WAS MUCH PRACTISED AMONG THE JEWS AND WAS PRODUCTIVE OF GREAT EVIL ONE OF THE JEWISH DOCTORS ASSERTED THAT IF A MAN BEHELD A WOMAN WHO WAS HANDSOMER THAN HIS WIFE HE MIGHT PUT AWAY HIS WIFE AND MARRY HER
5043-28401-0051 AND THUS ALL THE WIVES IN JUDEA EXCEPT THE HANDSOMEST MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIVORCED JOSEPHUS OBSERVES ON ONE OCCASION VERY COOLLY ABOUT THIS TIME I PUT AWAY MY WIFE WHO HAD BORNE ME THREE CHILDREN NOT BEING PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS
5043-28401-0052 ONE CAUSE OF UNHAPPINESS IN A MARRIED STATE IS TOO LITTLE AFFECTION AND IN OTHER INSTANCES ALTHOUGH AFFECTION MAY BE POSSESSED IT IS NOT SHOWN MONTESQUIEU OBSERVES THAT WOMEN
5043-28401-0053 COMMONLY RESERVE THEIR LOVE FOR THEIR HUSBANDS UNTIL THEIR HUSBANDS ARE DEAD SOMETIMES A MORTAL HATRED SPRINGS UP
5043-28401-0054 LIKE LIVIA TO POISON HER HUSBAND NOT ONLY IS A GREAT DISSIMILARITY OF RANK AND CONDITION A CAUSE OF DISLIKE BUT A GREAT VARIATION IN AGE IS FREQUENTLY THE CAUSE OF DISTRUST AND UNHAPPINESS
5043-28401-0055 THE PROPORTION WHICH ARISTOTLE SUGGESTS A MAN OF THIRTY SEVEN TO A WOMAN OF EIGHTEEN MAY BE APPROPRIATE IN ONE RESPECT BUT IT IS OBJECTIONABLE IN OTHERS
5043-28401-0056 THE LIFE OF THE FEMALE IS JUST AS LONG AS THAT OF THE MALE AND THE UNION OF MIDDLE AGE AND YOUTH WHERE THE ONE IS TWICE AS OLD AS THE OTHER WILL NOT ALWAYS ALLOW AN UNIFORMITY OF FEELINGS AND DISPOSITION THE CASE OF SENECA TO WHICH WE HAVE ALLUDED
5043-28401-0057 AND THAT OF SIR MATTHEW HALE ARE EXCEPTIONS YOUTH IS GENERALLY GAY THOUGHTLESS AND FRIVOLOUS BUT LIFE IN MORE ADVANCED PERIODS IS SOBER THOUGHTFUL AND DIGNIFIED
5043-28401-0058 A HUSBAND SHOULD NOT BE DEEMED A TEACHER OR GUARDIAN FOR THE WIFE SO MUCH AS A COMPANION AND THE WIFE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS GUARDIAN FOR THE HUSBAND THERE OUGHT TO BE A MUTUAL SYMPATHY
