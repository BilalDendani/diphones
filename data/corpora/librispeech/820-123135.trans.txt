820-123135-0000 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM ON A TABLE LAY THE COFFIN WITH WAX CANDLES BURNING ALL ROUND IT ON TALL SILVER CANDELABRA IN THE FURTHER CORNER SAT THE CHANTER READING THE PSALMS IN A LOW MONOTONOUS VOICE
820-123135-0001 I STOPPED AT THE DOOR AND TRIED TO LOOK BUT MY EYES WERE SO WEAK WITH CRYING AND MY NERVES SO TERRIBLY ON EDGE THAT I COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING EVERY OBJECT SEEMED TO MINGLE TOGETHER IN A STRANGE BLUR
820-123135-0002 THE CANDLES THE BROCADE THE VELVET THE GREAT CANDELABRA THE PINK SATIN CUSHION TRIMMED WITH LACE THE CHAPLET OF FLOWERS THE RIBBONED CAP AND SOMETHING OF A TRANSPARENT
820-123135-0003 I MOUNTED A CHAIR TO SEE HER FACE YET WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN I COULD SEE ONLY THAT WAX LIKE TRANSPARENT SOMETHING I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT TO BE HER FACE YET
820-123135-0004 AS I STOOD GRAZING AT IT I AT LAST RECOGNISED THE WELL KNOWN BELOVED FEATURES I SHUDDERED WITH HORROR TO REALISE THAT IT WAS SHE WHY WERE THOSE EYES SO SUNKEN
820-123135-0005 WHAT HAD LAID THAT DREADFUL PALENESS UPON HER CHEEKS AND STAMPED THE BLACK SPOT BENEATH THE TRANSPARENT SKIN ON ONE OF THEM
820-123135-0006 WHY WERE THE LIPS SO WHITE AND THEIR OUTLINE SO BEAUTIFUL SO MAJESTIC SO EXPRESSIVE OF AN UNNATURAL CALM THAT AS I LOOKED AT THEM A CHILL SHUDDER RAN THROUGH MY HAIR
820-123135-0007 AND DOWN MY BACK SOMEHOW AS I GAZED AN IRREPRESSIBLE INCOMPREHENSIBLE POWER SEEMED TO COMPEL ME TO KEEP MY EYES FIXED UPON THAT LIFELESS FACE I COULD NOT TURN AWAY
820-123135-0008 AND MY IMAGINATION BEGAN TO PICTURE BEFORE ME SCENES OF HER ACTIVE LIFE AND HAPPINESS I FORGOT THAT THE CORPSE LYING BEFORE ME NOW
820-123135-0009 THE THING AT WHICH I WAS GAZING UNCONSCIOUSLY AS AT AN OBJECT WHICH HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH MY DREAMS WAS SHE I FANCIED I COULD SEE HER NOW HERE NOW THERE
820-123135-0010 ALIVE HAPPY AND SMILING THEN SOME WELL KNOWN FEATURE IN THE FACE AT WHICH I WAS GAZING WOULD SUDDENLY ARREST MY ATTENTION AND IN A FLASH I WOULD RECALL THE TERRIBLE REALITY AND SHUDDER
820-123135-0011 THOUGH STILL UNABLE TO TURN MY EYES AWAY THEN AGAIN THE DREAMS WOULD REPLACE REALITY THEN AGAIN THE REALITY PUT TO FLIGHT THE DREAMS AT LAST THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BOTH LEFT ME
820-123135-0012 AND FOR A WHILE I BECAME INSENSIBLE HOW LONG I REMAINED IN THAT CONDITION I DO NOT KNOW NOR YET HOW IT OCCURRED I ONLY KNOW THAT FOR A TIME I LOST ALL SENSE OF EXISTENCE
820-123135-0013 AND EXPERIENCED A KIND OF VAGUE BLISSFULNESS WHICH THOUGH GRAND AND SWEET WAS ALSO SAD IT MAY BE THAT AS IT ASCENDED TO A BETTER WORLD HER BEAUTIFUL SOUL HAD LOOKED DOWN WITH LONGING AT THE WORLD IN WHICH SHE HAD LEFT US
820-123135-0014 THAT IT HAD SEEN MY SORROW AND PITYING ME HAD RETURNED TO EARTH ON THE WINGS OF LOVE TO CONSOLE AND BLESS ME WITH A HEAVENLY SMILE OF COMPASSION
820-123135-0015 THE NOISE AWAKENED ME AND MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT SEEING ME STANDING ON THE CHAIR IN A POSTURE WHICH HAD NOTHING TOUCHING IN ITS ASPECT
820-123135-0016 HE MIGHT TAKE ME FOR AN UNFEELING BOY WHO HAD CLIMBED ON TO THE CHAIR OUT OF MERE CURIOSITY WHEREFORE I HASTENED TO MAKE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS TO BEND DOWN MY HEAD AND TO BURST OUT CRYING
820-123135-0017 AS I RECALL NOW MY IMPRESSIONS OF THAT EPISODE I FIND THAT IT WAS ONLY DURING MY MOMENTS OF SELF FORGETFULNESS THAT MY GRIEF WAS WHOLEHEARTED TRUE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE FUNERAL I NEVER CEASED TO CRY
820-123135-0018 AND TO LOOK MISERABLE YET I FEEL CONSCIENCE STRICKEN WHEN I RECALL THAT GRIEF OF MINE SEEING THAT ALWAYS PRESENT IN IT THERE WAS AN ELEMENT OF CONCEIT OF A DESIRE TO SHOW THAT I WAS MORE GRIEVED THAN ANY ONE ELSE
820-123135-0019 OF AN INTEREST WHICH I TOOK IN OBSERVING THE EFFECT PRODUCED UPON OTHERS BY MY TEARS AND OF AN IDLE CURIOSITY LEADING ME TO REMARK MIMI'S BONNET AND THE FACES OF ALL PRESENT
820-123135-0020 THE MERE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT I DESPISED MYSELF FOR NOT FEELING GRIEF TO THE EXCLUSION OF EVERYTHING ELSE AND THAT I ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL THE FACT SHOWS THAT MY SADNESS WAS INSINCERE AND UNNATURAL
820-123135-0021 I TOOK A DELIGHT IN FEELING THAT I WAS UNHAPPY AND IN TRYING TO FEEL MORE SO CONSEQUENTLY THIS EGOTISTIC CONSCIOUSNESS COMPLETELY ANNULLED ANY ELEMENT OF SINCERITY IN MY WOE
820-123135-0022 THAT NIGHT I SLEPT CALMLY AND SOUNDLY AS IS USUAL AFTER ANY GREAT EMOTION AND AWOKE WITH MY TEARS DRIED AND MY NERVES RESTORED
820-123135-0023 AT TEN O'CLOCK WE WERE SUMMONED TO ATTEND THE PRE FUNERAL REQUIEM THE ROOM WAS FULL OF WEEPING SERVANTS AND PEASANTS WHO HAD COME TO BID FAREWELL TO THEIR LATE MISTRESS DURING THE SERVICE I MYSELF WEPT A GREAT DEAL
820-123135-0024 MADE FREQUENT SIGNS OF THE CROSS AND PERFORMED MANY GENUFLECTIONS BUT I DID NOT PRAY WITH MY SOUL AND FELT IF ANYTHING ALMOST INDIFFERENT MY THOUGHTS WERE CHIEFLY CENTRED UPON THE NEW COAT WHICH I WAS WEARING
820-123135-0025 A GARMENT WHICH WAS TIGHT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND UPON HOW TO AVOID SOILING MY TROUSERS AT THE KNEES ALSO I TOOK THE MOST MINUTE NOTICE OF ALL PRESENT PAPA STOOD AT THE HEAD OF THE COFFIN
820-123135-0026 HE WAS AS WHITE AS SNOW AND ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY RESTRAINED HIS TEARS HIS TALL FIGURE IN ITS BLACK FROCKCOAT HIS PALE EXPRESSIVE FACE THE GRACEFUL ASSURED MANNER IN WHICH AS USUAL
820-123135-0027 HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OR BOWED UNTIL HE TOUCHED THE FLOOR WITH HIS HAND A CUSTOM OF THE GREEK FUNERAL RITE OR TOOK THE CANDLE FROM THE PRIEST OR WENT TO THE COFFIN ALL WERE EXCEEDINGLY EFFECTIVE YET FOR SOME REASON OR ANOTHER
820-123135-0028 I FELT A GRUDGE AGAINST HIM FOR THAT VERY ABILITY TO APPEAR EFFECTIVE AT SUCH A MOMENT MIMI STOOD LEANING AGAINST THE WALL AS THOUGH SCARCELY ABLE TO SUPPORT HERSELF HER DRESS WAS ALL AWRY AND COVERED WITH FEATHERS
820-123135-0029 AND HER CAP COCKED TO ONE SIDE WHILE HER EYES WERE RED WITH WEEPING HER LEGS TREMBLING UNDER HER AND SHE SOBBED INCESSANTLY IN A HEARTRENDING MANNER AS EVER AND AGAIN SHE BURIED HER FACE IN HER HANDKERCHIEF OR HER HANDS
820-123135-0030 I IMAGINE THAT SHE DID THIS TO CHECK HER CONTINUAL SOBBING WITHOUT BEING SEEN BY THE SPECTATORS I REMEMBER TOO HER TELLING PAPA THE EVENING BEFORE
820-123135-0031 THAT MAMMA'S DEATH HAD COME UPON HER AS A BLOW FROM WHICH SHE COULD NEVER HOPE TO RECOVER THAT WITH MAMMA SHE HAD LOST EVERYTHING BUT THAT THE ANGEL AS SHE CALLED MY MOTHER HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HER WHEN AT THE POINT OF DEATH
820-123135-0032 MIMI'S AND KATENKA'S FORTUNES SECURE FOR EVER MIMI HAD SHED BITTER TEARS WHILE RELATING THIS AND VERY LIKELY HER SORROW IF NOT WHOLLY PURE AND DISINTERESTED WAS IN THE MAIN SINCERE
820-123135-0033 LUBOTSHKA IN BLACK GARMENTS AND SUFFUSED WITH TEARS STOOD WITH HER HEAD BOWED UPON HER BREAST SHE RARELY LOOKED AT THE COFFIN YET WHENEVER SHE DID SO HER FACE EXPRESSED A SORT OF CHILDISH FEAR
820-123135-0034 KATENKA STOOD NEAR HER MOTHER AND DESPITE HER LENGTHENED FACE LOOKED AS LOVELY AS EVER WOLODA'S FRANK NATURE WAS FRANK ALSO IN GRIEF HE STOOD LOOKING GRAVE
820-123135-0035 AND AS THOUGH HE WERE STARING AT SOME OBJECT WITH FIXED EYES THEN SUDDENLY HIS LIPS WOULD BEGIN TO QUIVER AND HE WOULD HASTILY MAKE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS AND BEND HIS HEAD AGAIN
820-123135-0036 SUCH OF THOSE PRESENT AS WERE STRANGERS I FOUND INTOLERABLE
820-123135-0037 SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS THAT SHE IS BETTER OFF NOW SHE WAS TOO GOOD FOR THIS WORLD AND SO ON AWAKENED IN ME SOMETHING LIKE FURY WHAT RIGHT HAD THEY TO WEEP OVER OR TO TALK ABOUT HER
820-123135-0038 SOME OF THEM IN REFERRING TO OURSELVES CALLED US ORPHANS JUST AS THOUGH IT WERE NOT A MATTER OF COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT CHILDREN WHO HAVE LOST THEIR MOTHER ARE KNOWN AS ORPHANS PROBABLY I THOUGHT
820-123135-0039 THEY LIKED TO BE THE FIRST TO GIVE US THAT NAME JUST AS SOME PEOPLE FIND PLEASURE IN BEING THE FIRST TO ADDRESS A NEWLY MARRIED GIRL AS MADAME IN A FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM
820-123135-0040 AND ALMOST HIDDEN BY THE OPEN DOOR OF THE DINING ROOM STOOD A GREY OLD WOMAN WITH BENT KNEES WITH HANDS CLASPED TOGETHER AND EYES LIFTED TO HEAVEN SHE PRAYED ONLY NOT WEPT
820-123135-0041 HER SOUL WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND SHE WAS ASKING HIM SOON TO REUNITE HER TO HER WHOM SHE HAD LOVED BEYOND ALL BEINGS ON THIS EARTH AND WHOM SHE STEADFASTLY BELIEVED THAT SHE WOULD VERY SOON MEET AGAIN
820-123135-0042 THERE STANDS ONE WHO SINCERELY LOVED HER I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AND FELT ASHAMED THE REQUIEM WAS OVER THEY UNCOVERED THE FACE OF THE DECEASED
820-123135-0043 AND ALL PRESENT EXCEPT OURSELVES WENT TO THE COFFIN TO GIVE HER THE KISS OF FAREWELL ONE OF THE LAST TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER DEPARTED MISTRESS WAS A PEASANT WOMAN WHO WAS HOLDING BY THE HAND
820-123135-0044 A PRETTY LITTLE GIRL OF FIVE WHOM SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER GOD KNOWS FOR WHAT REASON JUST AT A MOMENT WHEN I CHANCED TO DROP MY WET HANDKERCHIEF AND WAS STOOPING TO PICK IT UP AGAIN A LOUD PIERCING SCREAM STARTLED ME
820-123135-0045 AND FILLED ME WITH SUCH TERROR THAT WERE I TO LIVE A HUNDRED YEARS MORE I SHOULD NEVER FORGET IT EVEN NOW THE RECOLLECTION ALWAYS SENDS A COLD SHUDDER THROUGH MY FRAME I RAISED MY HEAD
820-123135-0046 STANDING ON THE CHAIR NEAR THE COFFIN WAS THE PEASANT WOMAN WHILE STRUGGLING AND FIGHTING IN HER ARMS WAS THE LITTLE GIRL AND IT WAS THIS SAME POOR CHILD WHO HAD SCREAMED WITH SUCH DREADFUL DESPERATE FRENZY
820-123135-0047 AS STRAINING HER TERRIFIED FACE AWAY SHE STILL CONTINUED TO GAZE WITH DILATED EYES AT THE FACE OF THE CORPSE I TOO SCREAMED IN A VOICE PERHAPS MORE DREADFUL STILL AND RAN HEADLONG FROM THE ROOM
820-123135-0048 ONLY NOW DID I UNDERSTAND THE SOURCE OF THE STRONG OPPRESSIVE SMELL WHICH MINGLING WITH THE SCENT OF THE INCENSE FILLED THE CHAMBER WHILE THE THOUGHT THAT THE FACE WHICH BUT A FEW DAYS AGO HAD BEEN FULL OF FRESHNESS AND BEAUTY
820-123135-0049 THE FACE WHICH I LOVED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN ALL THE WORLD WAS NOW CAPABLE OF INSPIRING HORROR AT LENGTH REVEALED TO ME AS THOUGH FOR THE FIRST TIME
