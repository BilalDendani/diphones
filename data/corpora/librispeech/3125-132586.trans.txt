3125-132586-0000 THIS IS NO MORTAL BUSINESS NOR NO SOUND THAT THE EARTH OWES SHAKESPEARE WE NOW RETURN TO THE MENTION OF MONTONI WHOSE RAGE AND DISAPPOINTMENT
3125-132586-0001 WERE SOON LOST IN NEARER INTERESTS THAN ANY WHICH THE UNHAPPY EMILY HAD AWAKENED HIS DEPREDATIONS HAVING EXCEEDED THEIR USUAL LIMITS AND REACHED AN EXTENT AT WHICH NEITHER THE TIMIDITY OF THE THEN COMMERCIAL SENATE OF VENICE
3125-132586-0002 WHILE A CORPS OF CONSIDERABLE STRENGTH WAS UPON THE POINT OF RECEIVING ORDERS TO MARCH FOR UDOLPHO A YOUNG OFFICER PROMPTED PARTLY BY RESENTMENT FOR SOME INJURY RECEIVED FROM MONTONI AND PARTLY BY THE HOPE OF DISTINCTION
3125-132586-0003 SOLICITED AN INTERVIEW WITH THE MINISTER WHO DIRECTED THE ENTERPRISE TO HIM HE REPRESENTED THAT THE SITUATION OF UDOLPHO RENDERED IT TOO STRONG TO BE TAKEN BY OPEN FORCE EXCEPT AFTER SOME TEDIOUS OPERATIONS
3125-132586-0004 THAT MONTONI HAD LATELY SHEWN HOW CAPABLE HE WAS OF ADDING TO ITS STRENGTH ALL THE ADVANTAGES WHICH COULD BE DERIVED FROM THE SKILL OF A COMMANDER THAT SO CONSIDERABLE A BODY OF TROOPS AS THAT ALLOTTED TO THE EXPEDITION COULD NOT APPROACH UDOLPHO WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE
3125-132586-0005 AND THAT IT WAS NOT FOR THE HONOUR OF THE REPUBLIC TO HAVE A LARGE PART OF ITS REGULAR FORCE EMPLOYED FOR SUCH A TIME AS THE SIEGE OF UDOLPHO WOULD REQUIRE UPON THE ATTACK OF A HANDFUL OF BANDITTI
3125-132586-0006 THE OBJECT OF THE EXPEDITION HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE ACCOMPLISHED MUCH MORE SAFELY AND SPEEDILY BY MINGLING CONTRIVANCE WITH FORCE IT WAS POSSIBLE TO MEET MONTONI AND HIS PARTY WITHOUT THEIR WALLS AND TO ATTACK THEM THEN
3125-132586-0007 OR BY APPROACHING THE FORTRESS WITH THE SECRECY CONSISTENT WITH THE MARCH OF SMALLER BODIES OF TROOPS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE EITHER OF THE TREACHERY OR NEGLIGENCE OF SOME OF HIS PARTY AND TO RUSH UNEXPECTEDLY UPON THE WHOLE
3125-132586-0008 THIS ADVICE WAS SERIOUSLY ATTENDED TO AND THE OFFICER WHO GAVE IT RECEIVED THE COMMAND OF THE TROOPS DEMANDED FOR HIS PURPOSE HIS FIRST EFFORTS WERE ACCORDINGLY THOSE OF CONTRIVANCE ALONE
3125-132586-0009 OF WHOM HE FOUND NONE THAT HE ADDRESSED UNWILLING TO PUNISH THEIR IMPERIOUS MASTER AND TO SECURE THEIR OWN PARDON FROM THE SENATE HE LEARNED ALSO THE NUMBER OF MONTONI'S TROOPS AND THAT IT HAD BEEN MUCH INCREASED SINCE HIS LATE SUCCESSES
3125-132586-0010 THE CONCLUSION OF HIS PLAN WAS SOON EFFECTED HAVING RETURNED WITH HIS PARTY WHO RECEIVED THE WATCH WORD AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FROM THEIR FRIENDS WITHIN MONTONI AND HIS OFFICERS WERE SURPRISED BY ONE DIVISION WHO HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO THEIR APARTMENT
3125-132586-0011 WHILE THE OTHER MAINTAINED THE SLIGHT COMBAT WHICH PRECEDED THE SURRENDER OF THE WHOLE GARRISON AMONG THE PERSONS SEIZED WITH MONTONI WAS ORSINO THE ASSASSIN WHO HAD JOINED HIM ON HIS FIRST ARRIVAL AT UDOLPHO
3125-132586-0012 AND WHOSE CONCEALMENT HAD BEEN MADE KNOWN TO THE SENATE BY COUNT MORANO AFTER THE UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT OF THE LATTER TO CARRY OFF EMILY IT WAS INDEED PARTLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF CAPTURING THIS MAN BY WHOM ONE OF THE SENATE HAD BEEN MURDERED
3125-132586-0013 THAT THE EXPEDITION WAS UNDERTAKEN AND ITS SUCCESS WAS SO ACCEPTABLE TO THEM THAT MORANO WAS INSTANTLY RELEASED NOTWITHSTANDING THE POLITICAL SUSPICIONS WHICH MONTONI BY HIS SECRET ACCUSATION HAD EXCITED AGAINST HIM THE CELERITY AND EASE
3125-132586-0014 WITH WHICH THIS WHOLE TRANSACTION WAS COMPLETED PREVENTED IT FROM ATTRACTING CURIOSITY OR EVEN FROM OBTAINING A PLACE IN ANY OF THE PUBLISHED RECORDS OF THAT TIME SO THAT EMILY
3125-132586-0015 WAS IGNORANT OF THE DEFEAT AND SIGNAL HUMILIATION OF HER LATE PERSECUTOR HER MIND WAS NOW OCCUPIED WITH SUFFERINGS WHICH NO EFFORT OF REASON HAD YET BEEN ABLE TO CONTROUL
3125-132586-0016 WHO SINCERELY ATTEMPTED WHATEVER BENEVOLENCE COULD SUGGEST FOR SOFTENING THEM SOMETIMES ALLOWED HER THE SOLITUDE SHE WISHED FOR SOMETIMES LED HER INTO FRIENDLY PARTIES AND CONSTANTLY PROTECTED HER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
3125-132586-0017 FROM THE SHREWD ENQUIRIES AND CRITICAL CONVERSATION OF THE COUNTESS HE OFTEN INVITED HER TO MAKE EXCURSIONS WITH HIM AND HIS DAUGHTER DURING WHICH HE CONVERSED ENTIRELY ON QUESTIONS SUITABLE TO HER TASTE WITHOUT APPEARING TO CONSULT IT
3125-132586-0018 AND THUS ENDEAVOURED GRADUALLY TO WITHDRAW HER FROM THE SUBJECT OF HER GRIEF AND TO AWAKE OTHER INTERESTS IN HER MIND EMILY TO WHOM HE APPEARED AS THE ENLIGHTENED FRIEND AND PROTECTOR OF HER YOUTH SOON FELT FOR HIM THE TENDER AFFECTION OF A DAUGHTER
3125-132586-0019 AND HER HEART EXPANDED TO HER YOUNG FRIEND BLANCHE AS TO A SISTER
3125-132586-0020 IT WAS LONG BEFORE SHE COULD SUFFICIENTLY ABSTRACT HER MIND FROM VALANCOURT TO LISTEN TO THE STORY PROMISED BY OLD DOROTHEE
3125-132586-0021 BUT DOROTHEE AT LENGTH REMINDED HER OF IT
3125-132586-0022 STILL HER THOUGHTS WERE EMPLOYED BY CONSIDERATIONS WHICH WEAKENED HER CURIOSITY AND DOROTHEE'S TAP AT THE DOOR SOON AFTER TWELVE SURPRISED HER ALMOST AS MUCH AS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED I AM COME AT LAST LADY
3125-132586-0023 THAT I ALMOST FANCIED I SAW HER AS SHE APPEARED UPON HER DEATH BED EMILY NOW DREW HER CHAIR NEAR TO DOROTHEE WHO WENT ON IT IS ABOUT TWENTY YEARS SINCE MY LADY MARCHIONESS CAME A BRIDE TO THE CHATEAU
3125-132586-0024 O I WELL REMEMBER HOW SHE LOOKED WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE GREAT HALL WHERE WE SERVANTS WERE ALL ASSEMBLED TO WELCOME HER AND HOW HAPPY MY LORD THE MARQUIS SEEMED AH WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEN BUT
3125-132586-0025 MY LADY MARCHIONESS WAS THEN ABOUT YOUR AGE AND AS I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT VERY LIKE YOU
3125-132586-0026 I WAS YOUNGER MA'AMSELLE THEN THAN I AM NOW AND WAS AS GAY AT THE BEST OF THEM
3125-132586-0027 IT WAS VERY BECOMING TRULY MY LORD THE MARQUIS NOTICED ME
3125-132586-0028 YOU WAS TELLING ME OF HER O YES MY LADY MARCHIONESS I THOUGHT SHE DID NOT SEEM HAPPY AT HEART AND ONCE SOON AFTER THE MARRIAGE I CAUGHT HER CRYING IN HER CHAMBER BUT WHEN SHE SAW ME SHE DRIED HER EYES AND PRETENDED TO SMILE
3125-132586-0029 I DID NOT DARE THEN TO ASK WHAT WAS THE MATTER
3125-132586-0030 AND SHE SEEMED DISPLEASED SO I SAID NO MORE I FOUND OUT SOME TIME AFTER HOW IT WAS HER FATHER IT SEEMS HAD COMMANDED HER TO MARRY MY LORD THE MARQUIS FOR HIS MONEY AND THERE WAS ANOTHER NOBLEMAN OR ELSE A CHEVALIER THAT SHE LIKED BETTER
3125-132586-0031 AND THAT WAS VERY FOND OF HER AND SHE FRETTED FOR THE LOSS OF HIM I FANCY BUT SHE NEVER TOLD ME SO MY LADY ALWAYS TRIED TO CONCEAL HER TEARS FROM THE MARQUIS FOR I HAVE OFTEN SEEN HER AFTER SHE HAS BEEN SO SORROWFUL LOOK SO CALM AND SWEET WHEN HE CAME INTO THE ROOM
3125-132586-0032 BUT MY LORD ALL OF A SUDDEN GREW GLOOMY AND FRETFUL AND VERY UNKIND SOMETIMES TO MY LADY THIS AFFLICTED HER VERY MUCH AS I SAW FOR SHE NEVER COMPLAINED AND SHE USED TO TRY SO SWEETLY TO OBLIGE HIM AND TO BRING HIM INTO A GOOD HUMOUR
3125-132586-0033 THAT MY HEART HAS OFTEN ACHED TO SEE IT BUT HE USED TO BE STUBBORN AND GIVE HER HARSH ANSWERS
3125-132586-0034 POOR DEAR LADY BUT I SELDOM VENTURED TO GO TO HER I USED SOMETIMES TO THINK MY LORD WAS JEALOUS TO BE SURE MY LADY WAS GREATLY ADMIRED BUT SHE WAS TOO GOOD TO DESERVE SUSPICION
3125-132586-0035 THERE WAS ONE THAT I ALWAYS THOUGHT SEEMED JUST SUITED FOR MY LADY
3125-132586-0036 AND THERE WAS SUCH A GRACE AS IT WERE IN ALL HE DID OR SAID
3125-132586-0037 AND MY LADY MORE THOUGHTFUL AND IT CAME INTO MY HEAD THAT THIS WAS THE CHEVALIER SHE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED BUT I NEVER COULD LEARN FOR CERTAIN WHAT WAS THE CHEVALIER'S NAME DOROTHEE SAID EMILY
3125-132586-0038 WHY THAT I WILL NOT TELL EVEN TO YOU MA'AMSELLE FOR EVIL MAY COME OF IT I ONCE HEARD FROM A PERSON WHO IS SINCE DEAD THAT THE MARCHIONESS WAS NOT IN LAW THE WIFE OF THE MARQUIS FOR THAT SHE HAD BEFORE BEEN PRIVATELY MARRIED TO THE GENTLEMAN
3125-132586-0039 SHE WAS SO MUCH ATTACHED TO AND WAS AFTERWARDS AFRAID TO OWN IT TO HER FATHER WHO WAS A VERY STERN MAN BUT THIS SEEMS VERY UNLIKELY AND I NEVER GAVE MUCH FAITH TO IT
3125-132586-0040 AS I WAS SAYING THE MARQUIS WAS MOST OUT OF HUMOUR AS I THOUGHT WHEN THE CHEVALIER I SPOKE OF HAD BEEN AT THE CHATEAU AND AT LAST HIS ILL TREATMENT OF MY LADY MADE HER QUITE MISERABLE HE WOULD SEE HARDLY ANY VISITORS AT THE CASTLE AND MADE HER LIVE ALMOST BY HERSELF
3125-132586-0041 I WAS HER CONSTANT ATTENDANT AND SAW ALL SHE SUFFERED BUT STILL SHE NEVER COMPLAINED AFTER MATTERS HAD GONE ON THUS FOR NEAR A YEAR MY LADY WAS TAKEN ILL AND I THOUGHT HER LONG FRETTING HAD MADE HER SO BUT ALAS I FEAR IT WAS WORSE THAN THAT
3125-132586-0042 WORSE DOROTHEE SAID EMILY CAN THAT BE POSSIBLE I FEAR IT WAS SO MADAM THERE WERE STRANGE APPEARANCES BUT I WILL ONLY TELL WHAT HAPPENED MY LORD THE MARQUIS HUSH DOROTHEE WHAT SOUNDS WERE THOSE SAID EMILY
3125-132586-0043 DOROTHEE CHANGED COUNTENANCE AND WHILE THEY BOTH LISTENED THEY HEARD ON THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT MUSIC OF UNCOMMON SWEETNESS
3125-132586-0044 OR THAT SHE WAS STRUCK WITH SUPERSTITIOUS AWE
3125-132586-0045 I THINK I ONCE TOLD YOU MADAM SAID DOROTHEE THAT I FIRST HEARD THIS MUSIC SOON AFTER MY LADY'S DEATH
3125-132586-0046 I WAS SAYING MA'AMSELLE THAT I WELL REMEMBER WHEN FIRST I HEARD THAT MUSIC IT WAS ONE NIGHT SOON AFTER MY LADY'S DEATH THAT I HAD SAT UP LATER THAN USUAL AND I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS
3125-132586-0047 BUT I HAD BEEN THINKING A GREAT DEAL ABOUT MY POOR MISTRESS AND OF THE SAD SCENE I HAD LATELY WITNESSED THE CHATEAU WAS QUITE STILL AND I WAS IN THE CHAMBER AT A GOOD DISTANCE FROM THE REST OF THE SERVANTS
3125-132586-0048 AND THIS WITH THE MOURNFUL THINGS I HAD BEEN THINKING OF I SUPPOSE MADE ME LOW SPIRITED FOR I FELT VERY LONELY AND FORLORN AS IT WERE AND LISTENED OFTEN
3125-132586-0049 ONE DOES NOT SO MUCH MIND ABOUT ONE'S FEARS BUT ALL THE SERVANTS WERE GONE TO BED AND I SAT THINKING AND THINKING TILL I WAS ALMOST AFRAID TO LOOK ROUND THE ROOM AND MY POOR LADY'S COUNTENANCE OFTEN CAME TO MY MIND
3125-132586-0050 SUCH AS I HAD SEEN HER WHEN SHE WAS DYING AND ONCE OR TWICE I ALMOST THOUGHT I SAW HER BEFORE ME WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD SUCH SWEET MUSIC IT SEEMED JUST AT MY WINDOW AND I SHALL NEVER FORGET WHAT I FELT
3125-132586-0051 IT HAD MADE ME CRY TO HEAR HER MANY A TIME WHEN SHE HAS SAT IN HER ORIEL OF AN EVENING PLAYING UPON HER LUTE SUCH SAD SONGS AND SINGING SO O IT WENT TO ONE'S HEART
3125-132586-0052 I HAVE LISTENED IN THE ANTI CHAMBER FOR THE HOUR TOGETHER AND SHE WOULD SOMETIMES SIT PLAYING WITH THE WINDOW OPEN WHEN IT WAS SUMMER TIME TILL IT WAS QUITE DARK AND WHEN I HAVE GONE IN TO SHUT IT SHE HAS HARDLY SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT HOUR IT WAS
3125-132586-0053 BUT AS I SAID MADAM CONTINUED DOROTHEE WHEN FIRST I HEARD THE MUSIC THAT CAME JUST NOW I THOUGHT IT WAS MY LATE LADY'S AND I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT SO AGAIN WHEN I HAVE HEARD IT AS I HAVE DONE AT INTERVALS EVER SINCE
3125-132586-0054 SOMETIMES MANY MONTHS HAVE GONE BY BUT STILL IT HAS RETURNED IT IS EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVED EMILY THAT NO PERSON HAS YET DISCOVERED THE MUSICIAN
3125-132586-0055 AYE MA'AMSELLE IF IT HAD BEEN ANY THING EARTHLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED LONG AGO BUT WHO COULD HAVE COURAGE TO FOLLOW A SPIRIT AND IF THEY HAD WHAT GOOD COULD IT DO FOR SPIRITS YOU KNOW MA'AM CAN TAKE ANY SHAPE OR NO SHAPE AND THEY WILL BE HERE ONE MINUTE
3125-132586-0056 PRAY RESUME YOUR STORY OF THE MARCHIONESS SAID EMILY AND ACQUAINT ME WITH THE MANNER OF HER DEATH I WILL MA'AM SAID DOROTHEE BUT SHALL WE LEAVE THE WINDOW THIS COOL AIR REFRESHES ME REPLIED EMILY AND I LOVE TO HEAR IT CREEP ALONG THE WOODS
3125-132586-0057 AND TO LOOK UPON THIS DUSKY LANDSCAPE YOU WAS SPEAKING OF MY LORD THE MARQUIS WHEN THE MUSIC INTERRUPTED US YES MADAM MY LORD THE MARQUIS BECAME MORE AND MORE GLOOMY AND MY LADY GREW WORSE AND WORSE TILL ONE NIGHT SHE WAS TAKEN VERY ILL INDEED
3125-132586-0058 SHE LOOKED PITEOUSLY UP AT ME AND DESIRED I WOULD CALL THE MARQUIS AGAIN FOR HE WAS NOT YET COME AND TELL HIM SHE HAD SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO SAY TO HIM AT LAST HE CAME AND HE DID TO BE SURE SEEM VERY SORRY TO SEE HER
3125-132586-0059 BUT HE SAID VERY LITTLE MY LADY TOLD HIM SHE FELT HERSELF TO BE DYING AND WISHED TO SPEAK WITH HIM ALONE AND THEN I LEFT THE ROOM BUT I SHALL NEVER FORGET HIS LOOK AS I WENT WHEN I RETURNED I VENTURED TO REMIND MY LORD ABOUT SENDING FOR A DOCTOR
3125-132586-0060 FOR I SUPPOSED HE HAD FORGOT TO DO SO IN HIS GRIEF BUT MY LADY SAID IT WAS THEN TOO LATE BUT MY LORD SO FAR FROM THINKING SO SEEMED TO THINK LIGHT OF HER DISORDER
3125-132586-0061 TILL SHE WAS SEIZED WITH SUCH TERRIBLE PAINS O I NEVER SHALL FORGET HER SHRIEK MY LORD THEN SENT OFF A MAN AND HORSE FOR THE DOCTOR AND WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM AND ALL OVER THE CHATEAU IN THE GREATEST DISTRESS
3125-132586-0062 AND I STAID BY MY DEAR LADY AND DID WHAT I COULD TO EASE HER SUFFERINGS SHE HAD INTERVALS OF EASE AND IN ONE OF THESE SHE SENT FOR MY LORD AGAIN WHEN HE CAME I WAS GOING
3125-132586-0063 I CAN HARDLY BEAR TO THINK OF IT NOW
3125-132586-0064 AND TO BE SURE HE DID SEEM TO BE OVERWHELMED WITH THE THOUGHT OF HIS TREATMENT OF HER AND THIS AFFECTED HER SO MUCH THAT SHE FAINTED AWAY WE THEN GOT MY LORD OUT OF THE ROOM
3125-132586-0065 HE WENT INTO HIS LIBRARY AND THREW HIMSELF ON THE FLOOR AND THERE HE STAID AND WOULD HEAR NO REASON THAT WAS TALKED TO HIM WHEN MY LADY RECOVERED SHE ENQUIRED FOR HIM BUT AFTERWARDS SAID SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE HIS GRIEF AND DESIRED WE WOULD LET HER DIE QUIETLY
3125-132586-0066 SHE DIED IN MY ARMS MA'AMSELLE AND SHE WENT OFF AS PEACEFULLY AS A CHILD FOR ALL THE VIOLENCE OF HER DISORDER WAS PASSED
3125-132586-0067 FOR SHE WAS MUCH AFFECTED BY THE GOODNESS OF THE LATE MARCHIONESS AND BY THE MEEK PATIENCE WITH WHICH SHE HAD SUFFERED WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME RESUMED DOROTHEE ALAS HE CAME TOO LATE
3125-132586-0068 WHEN HE HAD SENT THE ATTENDANTS OUT OF THE ROOM HE ASKED ME SEVERAL ODD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MARCHIONESS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING THE MANNER IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN SEIZED AND HE OFTEN SHOOK HIS HEAD AT MY ANSWERS AND SEEMED TO MEAN MORE THAN HE CHOSE TO SAY
3125-132586-0069 BUT I UNDERSTOOD HIM TOO WELL HOWEVER I KEPT MY REMARKS TO MYSELF AND ONLY TOLD THEM TO MY HUSBAND WHO BADE ME HOLD MY TONGUE SOME OF THE OTHER SERVANTS HOWEVER SUSPECTED WHAT I DID AND STRANGE REPORTS WERE WHISPERED ABOUT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
3125-132586-0070 BUT NOBODY DARED TO MAKE ANY STIR ABOUT THEM WHEN MY LORD HEARD THAT MY LADY WAS DEAD HE SHUT HIMSELF UP AND WOULD SEE NOBODY BUT THE DOCTOR WHO USED TO BE WITH HIM ALONE SOMETIMES FOR AN HOUR TOGETHER
3125-132586-0071 ALL MY LORD'S VASSALS FOLLOWED THE FUNERAL AND THERE WAS NOT A DRY EYE AMONG THEM FOR SHE HAD DONE A DEAL OF GOOD AMONG THE POOR MY LORD THE MARQUIS I NEVER SAW ANY BODY SO MELANCHOLY AS HE WAS AFTERWARDS
3125-132586-0072 AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD BE IN SUCH FITS OF VIOLENCE THAT WE ALMOST THOUGHT HE HAD LOST HIS SENSES HE DID NOT STAY LONG AT THE CHATEAU BUT JOINED HIS REGIMENT AND SOON AFTER ALL THE SERVANTS EXCEPT MY HUSBAND AND I
3125-132586-0073 RECEIVED NOTICE TO GO FOR MY LORD WENT TO THE WARS I NEVER SAW HIM AFTER FOR HE WOULD NOT RETURN TO THE CHATEAU THOUGH IT IS SUCH A FINE PLACE AND NEVER FINISHED THOSE FINE ROOMS HE WAS BUILDING ON THE WEST SIDE OF IT
3125-132586-0074 AND IT HAS IN A MANNER BEEN SHUT UP EVER SINCE TILL MY LORD THE COUNT CAME HERE THE DEATH OF THE MARCHIONESS APPEARS EXTRAORDINARY SAID EMILY WHO WAS ANXIOUS TO KNOW MORE THAN SHE DARED TO ASK YES MADAM REPLIED DOROTHEE IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY
3125-132586-0075 I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL I SAW AND YOU MAY EASILY GUESS WHAT I THINK I CANNOT SAY MORE BECAUSE I WOULD NOT SPREAD REPORTS THAT MIGHT OFFEND MY LORD THE COUNT YOU ARE VERY RIGHT SAID EMILY
3125-132586-0076 AND NOW LADY I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL THIS SAD HISTORY AND ALL MY THOUGHTS AND YOU HAVE PROMISED YOU KNOW NEVER TO GIVE THE LEAST HINT ABOUT
3125-132586-0077 WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD HAS INTERESTED ME MORE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE
3125-132586-0078 DOROTHEE HOWEVER STEADILY REFUSED TO DO THIS AND THEN RETURNED TO THE NOTICE OF EMILY'S LIKENESS TO THE LATE MARCHIONESS THERE IS ANOTHER PICTURE OF HER ADDED SHE HANGING IN A ROOM OF THE SUITE WHICH WAS SHUT UP
3125-132586-0079 BUT EMILY REMINDED HER THAT THE COUNT HAD TALKED THE OTHER DAY OF ORDERING THEM TO BE OPENED OF WHICH DOROTHEE SEEMED TO CONSIDER MUCH AND THEN SHE OWNED
3125-132586-0080 THAN OTHERWISE AND AT LENGTH PROMISED TO SHEW THE PICTURE THE NIGHT WAS TOO FAR ADVANCED AND EMILY WAS TOO MUCH AFFECTED BY THE NARRATIVE OF THE SCENES WHICH HAD PASSED IN THOSE APARTMENTS TO WISH TO VISIT THEM AT THIS HOUR
3125-132586-0081 BUT SHE REQUESTED THAT DOROTHEE WOULD RETURN ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE NOT LIKELY TO BE OBSERVED AND CONDUCT HER THITHER BESIDES HER WISH TO EXAMINE THE PORTRAIT SHE FELT A THRILLING CURIOSITY TO SEE THE CHAMBER IN WHICH THE MARCHIONESS HAD DIED
3125-132586-0082 AND WHICH DOROTHEE HAD SAID REMAINED WITH THE BED AND FURNITURE JUST AS WHEN THE CORPSE WAS REMOVED FOR INTERMENT THE SOLEMN EMOTIONS WHICH THE EXPECTATION OF VIEWING SUCH A SCENE HAD AWAKENED WERE IN UNISON WITH THE PRESENT TONE OF HER MIND
3125-132586-0083 DEPRESSED BY SEVERE DISAPPOINTMENT CHEERFUL OBJECTS RATHER ADDED TO THAN REMOVED THIS DEPRESSION BUT PERHAPS SHE YIELDED TOO MUCH TO HER MELANCHOLY INCLINATION AND IMPRUDENTLY LAMENTED THE MISFORTUNE
3125-132586-0084 WHICH NO VIRTUE OF HER OWN COULD HAVE TAUGHT HER TO AVOID THOUGH NO EFFORT OF REASON COULD MAKE HER LOOK UNMOVED UPON THE SELF DEGRADATION OF HIM WHOM SHE HAD ONCE ESTEEMED AND LOVED DOROTHEE PROMISED TO RETURN ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT
3125-132586-0085 BUT THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT REMAINED LONG UNBROKEN EXCEPT BY THE MURMURING SOUNDS OF THE WOODS AS THEY WAVED IN THE BREEZE AND THEN BY THE DISTANT BELL OF THE CONVENT STRIKING ONE SHE NOW WITHDREW FROM THE WINDOW AND AS SHE SAT AT HER BED SIDE
3125-132586-0086 INDULGING MELANCHOLY REVERIES WHICH THE LONELINESS OF THE HOUR ASSISTED THE STILLNESS WAS SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED NOT BY MUSIC BUT BY VERY UNCOMMON SOUNDS THAT SEEMED TO COME EITHER FROM THE ROOM ADJOINING HER OWN OR FROM ONE BELOW
3125-132586-0087 THE TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE THAT HAD BEEN RELATED TO HER TOGETHER WITH THE MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES SAID TO HAVE SINCE OCCURRED IN THE CHATEAU HAD SO MUCH SHOCKED HER SPIRITS THAT SHE NOW SUNK FOR A MOMENT UNDER THE WEAKNESS OF SUPERSTITION
