4108-2772-0000 MISSUS PETT ON LEAVING THE LUNCHEON TABLE HAD RETURNED TO THE DRAWING ROOM TO SIT BESIDE THE SICK SETTEE OF HER STRICKEN CHILD SHE WAS TROUBLED ABOUT OGDEN THE POOR LAMB WAS NOT AT ALL HIMSELF TO DAY A BOWL OF CLEAR SOUP
4108-2772-0001 NO SAID OGDEN FIRMLY I'M FEELING A LOT WORSE YOU HAVEN'T DRUNK YOUR NICE SOUP FEED IT TO THE CAT COULD YOU EAT A NICE BOWL OF BREAD AND MILK PRECIOUS
4108-2772-0002 SHE PUT IT DOWN TO THE REACTION FROM THE EXCITEMENT WORKING ON A HIGHLY STRUNG TEMPERAMENT TO HIS PRESENT COLLAPSE THE BRUTAL BEHAVIOUR OF JERRY MITCHELL HAD OF COURSE CONTRIBUTED EVERY DROP OF HER MATERNAL BLOOD BOILED WITH RAGE AND HORROR
4108-2772-0003 WHENEVER SHE PERMITTED HERSELF TO CONTEMPLATE THE EXCESSES OF THE LATE JERRY SHE HAD ALWAYS MISTRUSTED THE MAN SHE HAD NEVER LIKED HIS FACE NOT MERELY ON AESTHETIC GROUNDS BUT BECAUSE SHE HAD SEEMED TO DETECT IN IT A LURKING SAVAGERY
4108-2772-0004 HOW RIGHT EVENTS HAD PROVED THIS INSTINCTIVE FEELING MISSUS PETT WAS NOT VULGAR ENOUGH TO DESCRIBE THE FEELING EVEN TO HERSELF AS A HUNCH BUT A HUNCH IT HAD BEEN AND LIKE EVERY ONE WHOSE HUNCHES HAVE PROVED CORRECT SHE WAS CONSCIOUS IN THE MIDST OF HER GRIEF
4108-2772-0005 FAINT SNORES PROCEEDED FROM THE BASKET IN THE CORNER WHERE AIDA THE POMERANIAN LAY CURLED IN REFRESHING SLEEP THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW FLOATED SOUNDS OF WARMTH AND SUMMER YIELDING TO THE DROWSY CALM
4108-2772-0006 MISSUS PETT WAS JUST NODDING INTO A PLEASANT NAP WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND LORD WISBEACH CAME IN LORD WISBEACH HAD BEEN DOING SOME RAPID THINKING RAPID THOUGHT IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIALS IN THE COMPOSITION OF MEN WHO ARE KNOWN AS GENTLEMAN JACK TO THE BOYS
4108-2772-0007 AMOUNTED TO THE REALISATION THAT THE BEST MODE OF DEFENCE IS ATTACK IT IS YOUR MAN WHO KNOWS HOW TO PLAY THE BOLD GAME ON OCCASION WHO WINS A DULLER SCHEMER THAN LORD WISBEACH MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONTENT TO BE INACTIVE AFTER SUCH A CONVERSATION
4108-2772-0008 AS HAD JUST TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND JIMMY HIS LORDSHIP GIVING THE MATTER THE CONCENTRATED ATTENTION OF HIS TRAINED MIND HAD HIT ON A BETTER PLAN AND HE HAD COME TO THE DRAWING ROOM NOW TO PUT IT INTO EFFECT HIS ENTRANCE SHATTERED THE PEACEFUL ATMOSPHERE
4108-2772-0009 LORD WISBEACH CAME OUT FROM BEHIND HIS CHAIR AND SAT DOWN WARILY CAN I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU MISSUS PETT CERTAINLY LORD WISBEACH HIS LORDSHIP LOOKED MEANINGLY AT OGDEN IN PRIVATE YOU KNOW
4108-2772-0010 HE THEN LOOKED MEANINGLY AT MISSUS PETT OGDEN DARLING SAID MISSUS PETT
4108-2772-0011 WITH SURPRISING DOCILITY THE BOY ROSE ALL RIGHT HE SAID POOR OGGIE IS NOT AT ALL WELL TO DAY SAID MISSUS PETT WHEN HE WAS GONE HE IS VERY SUBJECT TO THESE ATTACKS
4108-2772-0012 HIS LORDSHIP DREW HIS CHAIR A LITTLE CLOSER MISSUS PETT YOU REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU YESTERDAY OF COURSE MIGHT I ASK WHAT YOU KNOW OF THIS MAN WHO HAS COME HERE CALLING HIMSELF JIMMY CROCKER MISSUS PETT STARTED
4108-2772-0013 SHE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD USED ALMOST THAT VERY EXPRESSION TO ANN HER SUSPICIONS WHICH HAD BEEN LULLED BY THE PROMPT RECOGNITION OF THE VISITOR BY SKINNER AND LORD WISBEACH RETURNED IT IS ONE OF THE EFFECTS OF A SUCCESSFUL HUNCH THAT IT BREEDS OTHER HUNCHES
4108-2772-0014 REMEMBER WHAT I SAID TO YOU YESTERDAY BUT SKINNER THE BUTLER RECOGNISED HIM EXACTLY IT GOES TO PROVE THAT WHAT I SAID ABOUT SKINNER WAS CORRECT THEY ARE WORKING TOGETHER THE THING IS SELF EVIDENT LOOK AT IT FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW HOW SIMPLE IT IS
4108-2772-0015 BUT WHY DID YOU I TOLD YOU THAT I PRETENDED TO ACCEPT THIS MAN AS THE REAL JIMMY CROCKER FOR A PURPOSE AT PRESENT THERE IS NOTHING THAT YOU CAN DO MERE IMPERSONATION IS NOT A CRIME IF I HAD EXPOSED HIM WHEN WE MET
4108-2772-0016 WHEREAS IF WE WAIT IF WE PRETEND TO SUSPECT NOTHING WE SHALL UNDOUBTEDLY CATCH HIM RED HANDED IN AN ATTEMPT ON YOUR NEPHEW'S INVENTION YOU ARE SURE THAT THAT IS WHY HE HAS COME WHAT OTHER REASON COULD HE HAVE
4108-2772-0017 THERE WAS NOT A CHILD IN AMERICA WHO HAD TO BE MORE CLOSELY GUARDED WHY THE KIDNAPPERS HAD A SPECIAL NICK NAME FOR OGGIE THEY CALLED HIM THE LITTLE NUGGET OF COURSE THEN IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THAT MAY BE THE MAN'S OBJECT
4108-2772-0018 IN ANY CASE OUR COURSE MUST BE THE SAME WE MUST WATCH EVERY MOVE HE MAKES HE PAUSED I COULD HELP PARDON MY SUGGESTING IT I COULD HELP A GREAT DEAL MORE IF YOU WERE TO INVITE ME TO LIVE IN THE HOUSE YOU WERE KIND ENOUGH TO ASK ME TO VISIT YOU IN THE COUNTRY
4108-2772-0019 BUT IT WILL BE TWO WEEKS BEFORE YOU GO TO THE COUNTRY AND IN THOSE TWO WEEKS YOU MUST COME HERE AT ONCE LORD WISBEACH TO NIGHT
4108-2772-0020 I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR ALL YOU ARE DOING YOU HAVE BEEN SO KIND TO ME MISSUS PETT SAID LORD WISBEACH WITH FEELING THAT IT IS SURELY ONLY RIGHT THAT I SHOULD TRY TO MAKE SOME RETURN LET US LEAVE IT AT THIS THEN I WILL COME HERE TO NIGHT
4108-2772-0021 AND WILL MAKE IT MY BUSINESS TO WATCH THESE TWO MEN I WILL GO AND PACK MY THINGS AND HAVE THEM SENT HERE IT IS WONDERFUL OF YOU LORD WISBEACH NOT AT ALL REPLIED HIS LORDSHIP IT WILL BE A PLEASURE
4108-2772-0022 HE HELD OUT HIS HAND DRAWING IT BACK RAPIDLY AS THE DOG AIDA MADE A SNAP AT IT SUBSTITUTING A LONG RANGE LEAVE TAKING FOR THE MORE INTIMATE FAREWELL HE LEFT THE ROOM WHEN HE HAD GONE MISSUS PETT REMAINED FOR SOME MINUTES THINKING
4108-2772-0023 SHE WAS AFLAME WITH EXCITEMENT SHE HAD A SENSATIONAL MIND AND IT HAD ABSORBED LORD WISBEACH'S REVELATIONS EAGERLY HER ADMIRATION FOR HIS LORDSHIP WAS INTENSE AND SHE TRUSTED HIM UTTERLY THE ONLY DOUBT THAT OCCURRED TO HER WAS WHETHER
4108-2772-0024 WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS IN THE WORLD HE WOULD BE ABLE UNASSISTED TO FOIL A PAIR OF SCHEMERS SO DISTANT FROM EACH OTHER GEOGRAPHICALLY AS THE MAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF JIMMY CROCKER AND THE MAN WHO HAD CALLED HIMSELF SKINNER THAT WAS A POINT ON WHICH THEY HAD NOT TOUCHED
4108-2772-0025 THE FACT THAT ONE IMPOSTOR WAS ABOVE STAIRS THE OTHER BELOW IT SEEMED TO MISSUS PETT IMPOSSIBLE THAT LORD WISBEACH FOR ALL HIS ZEAL COULD WATCH SKINNER WITHOUT NEGLECTING JIMMY OR FOIL JIMMY WITHOUT TAKING HIS ATTENTION OFF SKINNER
4108-2772-0026 IT WAS MANIFESTLY A SITUATION THAT CALLED FOR ALLIES SHE FELT THAT SHE MUST HAVE FURTHER ASSISTANCE TO MISSUS PETT DOUBTLESS OWING TO HER HOBBY OF WRITING SENSATIONAL FICTION THERE WAS A MAGIC IN THE WORD DETECTIVE
4108-2772-0027 AND THE IDEA OF NEGLECTING TO EMPLOY ONE IN REAL LIFE NOW THAT CIRCUMSTANCES HAD COMBINED TO RENDER HIS ADVENT SO NECESSARY STRUCK HER AS BOTH RASH AND INARTISTIC IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN OGDEN HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED THE ONLY THING WHICH HAD BROUGHT HER BALM
4108-2772-0028 HAD BEEN THE DAILY INTERVIEWS WITH THE DETECTIVES SHE ACHED TO TELEPHONE FOR ONE NOW THE ONLY CONSIDERATION THAT KEPT HER BACK WAS A REGARD FOR LORD WISBEACH'S FEELINGS HE HAD BEEN SO KIND AND SO SHREWD THAT TO SUGGEST REINFORCING HIM WITH OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE
4108-2772-0029 MUST INFALLIBLY WOUND HIM DEEPLY AND YET THE SITUATION DEMANDED THE SERVICES OF A TRAINED SPECIALIST LORD WISBEACH HAD BORNE HIMSELF DURING THEIR RECENT CONVERSATION IN SUCH A MANNER
4108-2772-0030 AS TO LEAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF ADEQUATE TO DEAL WITH THE MATTER SINGLE HANDED BUT ADMIRABLE THOUGH HE WAS HE WAS NOT A PROFESSIONAL EXPONENT OF THE ART OF ESPIONAGE HE NEEDED TO BE HELPED IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4108-2772-0031 A HAPPY SOLUTION STRUCK MISSUS PETT THERE WAS NO NEED TO TELL HIM
4108-2772-0032 BY THE SIMPLE PROCESS OF ENGAGING ONE WITHOUT TELLING LORD WISBEACH ANYTHING ABOUT IT THE TELEPHONE STOOD AT HER ELBOW CONCEALED AT THE EXPRESS REQUEST OF THE INTERIOR DECORATOR WHO HAD DESIGNED THE ROOM IN THE INTERIOR OF WHAT LOOKED TO THE CASUAL EYE
4108-2772-0033 LIKE A STUFFED OWL ON A TABLE NEAR AT HAND HANDSOMELY BOUND IN MOROCCO TO RESEMBLE A COMPLETE WORKS OF SHAKESPEARE WAS THE TELEPHONE BOOK MISSUS PETT HESITATED NO LONGER
4108-2772-0034 SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THE ADDRESS OF THE DETECTIVE AGENCY WHICH SHE HAD EMPLOYED ON THE OCCASION OF THE KIDNAPPING OF OGDEN BUT SHE REMEMBERED THE NAME
4108-2772-0035 WHO HAD LISTENED TO HER TROUBLES THEN SHE UNHOOKED THE RECEIVER AND GAVE A NUMBER I WANT TO SPEAK TO MISTER STURGIS SHE SAID OH MISTER STURGIS SAID MISSUS PETT
4108-2772-0036 YOU REMEMBER WE MET SOME YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS MISSUS FORD YES THE MOTHER OF OGDEN FORD I WANT TO CONSULT
