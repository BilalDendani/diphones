6735-66412-0000 ON THE NILE IT WAS A CALLOUS COUNTRY INHABITED BY A CALLOUS RACE THOUGHT CALDER AS HE TRAVELLED DOWN THE NILE FROM WADI HALFA TO ASSOUAN ON HIS THREE MONTHS FURLOUGH
6735-66412-0001 HE LEANED OVER THE RAIL OF THE UPPER DECK OF THE STEAMER AND LOOKED DOWN UPON THE BARGE LASHED ALONGSIDE ON THE LOWER DECK OF THE BARGE AMONG THE NATIVE PASSENGERS STOOD AN ANGAREB
6735-66412-0002 SHROUDED IN A BLACK VEIL THE ANGAREB AND ITS BURDEN HAD BEEN CARRIED ON BOARD EARLY THAT MORNING AT KOROSKO BY TWO ARABS WHO NOW SAT LAUGHING AND CHATTERING IN THE STERN OF THE BARGE
6735-66412-0003 SO LITTLE HEED DID THEY GIVE TO IT CALDER LIFTED HIS EYES AND LOOKED TO HIS RIGHT AND HIS LEFT ACROSS GLARING SAND
6735-66412-0004 THE BLACK VEIL LAY CLOSE ABOUT THE FACE OUTLINING THE NOSE THE HOLLOWS OF THE EYES AND THE MOUTH BUT WHETHER THE LIPS WORE A MOUSTACHE AND THE CHIN A BEARD IT DID NOT REVEAL
6735-66412-0005 THE SLANTING SUNLIGHT CREPT NEARER AND NEARER TO THE ANGAREB THE NATIVES SEATED CLOSE TO IT MOVED INTO THE SHADOW OF THE UPPER DECK BUT NO ONE MOVED THE ANGAREB AND THE TWO MEN LAUGHING IN THE STERN
6735-66412-0006 GAVE NO THOUGHT TO THEIR CHARGE CALDER WATCHED THE BLAZE OF YELLOW LIGHT CREEP OVER THE BLACK RECUMBENT FIGURE FROM THE FEET UPWARDS IT BURNT AT LAST BRIGHT AND PITILESS UPON THE FACE
6735-66412-0007 YET THE LIVING CREATURE BENEATH THE VEIL NEVER STIRRED THE VEIL NEVER FLUTTERED ABOVE THE LIPS THE LEGS REMAINED STRETCHED OUT STRAIGHT THE ARMS LAY CLOSE AGAINST THE SIDE
6735-66412-0008 CALDER SHOUTED TO THE TWO MEN IN THE STERN MOVE THE ANGAREB INTO THE SHADOW HE CRIED AND BE QUICK THE ARABS ROSE RELUCTANTLY AND OBEYED HIM IS IT A MAN OR WOMAN ASKED CALDER
6735-66412-0009 A MAN WE ARE TAKING HIM TO THE HOSPITAL AT ASSOUAN BUT WE DO NOT THINK THAT HE WILL LIVE HE FELL FROM A PALM TREE THREE WEEKS AGO YOU GIVE HIM NOTHING TO EAT OR DRINK HE IS TOO ILL
6735-66412-0010 IT WAS A COMMON STORY AND THE LOGICAL OUTCOME OF THE BELIEF THAT LIFE AND DEATH ARE WRITTEN AND WILL INEVITABLY BEFALL AFTER THE MANNER OF THE WRITING
6735-66412-0011 THAT MAN LYING SO QUIET BENEATH THE BLACK COVERING HAD PROBABLY AT THE BEGINNING SUFFERED NOTHING MORE SERIOUS THAN A BRUISE WHICH A FEW SIMPLE REMEDIES WOULD HAVE CURED WITHIN A WEEK BUT HE HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO LIE EVEN AS HE LAY UPON THE ANGAREB
6735-66412-0012 AT THE MERCY OF THE SUN AND THE FLIES UNWASHED UNFED AND WITH HIS THIRST UNSLAKED THE BRUISE HAD BECOME A SORE THE SORE HAD GANGRENED
6735-66412-0013 HAD DISCOVERED THE ACCIDENT AND SENT THE MAN ON THE STEAMER DOWN TO ASSOUAN BUT FAMILIAR THOUGH THE STORY WAS CALDER COULD NOT DISMISS IT FROM HIS THOUGHTS THE IMMOBILITY OF THE SICK MAN UPON THE NATIVE BEDSTEAD IN A WAY FASCINATED HIM
6735-66412-0014 AND WHEN TOWARDS SUNSET A STRONG WIND SPRANG UP AND BLEW AGAINST THE STREAM HE FELT AN ACTUAL COMFORT IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE SICK MAN WOULD GAIN SOME RELIEF FROM IT
6735-66412-0015 AND WHEN HIS NEIGHBOUR THAT EVENING AT THE DINNER TABLE SPOKE TO HIM WITH A GERMAN ACCENT HE SUDDENLY ASKED UPON AN IMPULSE YOU ARE NOT A DOCTOR BY ANY CHANCE NOT A DOCTOR SAID THE GERMAN BUT A STUDENT OF MEDICINE AT BONN
6735-66412-0016 I CAME FROM CAIRO TO SEE THE SECOND CATARACT BUT WAS NOT ALLOWED TO GO FARTHER THAN WADI HALFA CALDER INTERRUPTED HIM AT ONCE THEN I WILL TRESPASS UPON YOUR HOLIDAY AND CLAIM YOUR PROFESSIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR YOURSELF
6735-66412-0017 WITH PLEASURE THOUGH I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED YOU WERE ILL SAID THE STUDENT SMILING GOOD NATUREDLY BEHIND HIS EYEGLASSES NOR AM I IT IS AN ARAB FOR WHOM I ASK YOUR HELP THE MAN ON THE BEDSTEAD YES
6735-66412-0018 IF YOU WILL BE SO GOOD I WILL WARN YOU HE WAS HURT THREE WEEKS AGO AND I KNOW THESE PEOPLE NO ONE WILL HAVE TOUCHED HIM SINCE HE WAS HURT THE SIGHT WILL NOT BE PRETTY
6735-66412-0019 THIS IS NOT A NICE COUNTRY FOR UNTENDED WOUNDS THE GERMAN STUDENT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS ALL EXPERIENCE IS GOOD SAID HE AND THE TWO MEN ROSE FROM THE TABLE AND WENT OUT ON TO THE UPPER DECK
6735-66412-0020 THE WIND HAD FRESHENED DURING THE DINNER AND BLOWING UP STREAM HAD RAISED WAVES SO THAT THE STEAMER AND ITS BARGE TOSSED AND THE WATER BROKE ON BOARD HE WAS BELOW THERE
6735-66412-0021 SAID THE STUDENT AS HE LEANED OVER THE RAIL AND PEERED DOWNWARDS TO THE LOWER DECK OF THE BARGE ALONGSIDE IT WAS NIGHT AND THE NIGHT WAS DARK ABOVE THAT LOWER DECK ONLY ONE LAMP SWUNG FROM THE CENTRE OF THE UPPER DECK
6735-66412-0022 GLIMMERED AND THREW UNCERTAIN LIGHTS AND UNCERTAIN SHADOWS OVER A SMALL CIRCLE BEYOND THE CIRCLE ALL WAS BLACK DARKNESS EXCEPT AT THE BOWS WHERE THE WATER BREAKING ON BOARD FLUNG A WHITE SHEET OF SPRAY
6735-66412-0023 IT COULD BE SEEN LIKE A SPRINKLE OF SNOW DRIVEN BY THE WIND IT COULD BE HEARD STRIKING THE DECK LIKE THE LASH OF A WHIP HE HAS BEEN MOVED SAID THE GERMAN NO DOUBT HE HAS BEEN MOVED
6735-66412-0024 THERE IS NO ONE IN THE BOWS CALDER BENT HIS HEAD DOWNWARDS AND STARED INTO THE DARKNESS FOR A LITTLE WHILE WITHOUT SPEAKING I BELIEVE THE ANGAREB IS THERE HE SAID AT LENGTH I BELIEVE IT IS
6735-66412-0025 FOLLOWED BY THE GERMAN HE HURRIED DOWN THE STAIRWAY TO THE LOWER DECK OF THE STEAMER AND WENT TO THE SIDE HE COULD MAKE CERTAIN NOW THE ANGAREB STOOD IN A WASH OF WATER ON THE VERY SPOT TO WHICH AT CALDER'S ORDER
6735-66412-0026 IT HAD BEEN MOVED THAT MORNING AND ON THE ANGAREB THE FIGURE BENEATH THE BLACK COVERING LAY AS MOTIONLESS AS EVER AS INEXPRESSIVE OF LIFE AND FEELING
6735-66412-0027 THOUGH THE COLD SPRAY BROKE CONTINUALLY UPON ITS FACE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SO SAID CALDER HE GOT A LANTERN AND WITH THE GERMAN STUDENT CLIMBED ACROSS THE BULWARKS ON TO THE BARGE HE SUMMONED THE TWO ARABS
6735-66412-0028 MOVE THE ANGAREB FROM THE BOWS HE SAID AND WHEN THEY HAD OBEYED NOW TAKE THAT COVERING OFF I WISH MY FRIEND WHO IS A DOCTOR TO SEE THE WOUND THE TWO MEN HESITATED
6735-66412-0029 AND THEN ONE OF THEM WITH AN AIR OF INSOLENCE OBJECTED THERE ARE DOCTORS IN ASSOUAN WHITHER WE ARE TAKING HIM CALDER RAISED THE LANTERN AND HIMSELF DREW THE VEIL AWAY FROM OFF THE WOUNDED MAN
6735-66412-0030 NOW IF YOU PLEASE HE SAID TO HIS COMPANION THE GERMAN STUDENT MADE HIS EXAMINATION OF THE WOUNDED THIGH WHILE CALDER HELD THE LANTERN ABOVE HIS HEAD AS CALDER HAD PREDICTED IT WAS NOT A PLEASANT BUSINESS
6735-66412-0031 FOR THE WOUND CRAWLED THE GERMAN STUDENT WAS GLAD TO COVER IT UP AGAIN I CAN DO NOTHING HE SAID PERHAPS IN A HOSPITAL WITH BATHS AND DRESSINGS
6735-66412-0032 RELIEF WILL BE GIVEN AT ALL EVENTS BUT MORE I DO NOT KNOW HERE I COULD NOT EVEN BEGIN TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL DO THESE TWO MEN UNDERSTAND ENGLISH NO ANSWERED CALDER
6735-66412-0033 THAT IS A LIE THE INJURY WAS DONE BY THE BLADE OF A SPEAR OR SOME WEAPON OF THE KIND ARE YOU SURE YES CALDER BENT DOWN SUDDENLY TOWARDS THE ARAB ON THE ANGAREB
6735-66412-0034 ALTHOUGH HE NEVER MOVED THE MAN WAS CONSCIOUS CALDER HAD BEEN LOOKING STEADILY AT HIM AND HE SAW THAT HIS EYES FOLLOWED THE SPOKEN WORDS YOU UNDERSTAND ENGLISH SAID CALDER
6735-66412-0035 THE ARAB COULD NOT ANSWER WITH HIS LIPS BUT A LOOK OF COMPREHENSION CAME INTO HIS FACE WHERE DO YOU COME FROM ASKED CALDER THE LIPS TRIED TO MOVE BUT NOT SO MUCH AS A WHISPER ESCAPED FROM THEM
6735-66412-0036 YET HIS EYES SPOKE BUT SPOKE VAINLY FOR THE MOST WHICH THEY COULD TELL WAS A GREAT EAGERNESS TO ANSWER CALDER DROPPED UPON HIS KNEE CLOSE BY THE MAN'S HEAD AND HOLDING THE LANTERN CLOSE
6735-66412-0037 ENUNCIATED THE TOWNS FROM DONGOLA NO GLEAM IN THE ARAB'S EYES RESPONDED TO THAT NAME FROM METEMNEH FROM BERBER FROM OMDURMAN AH
6735-66412-0038 THE ARAB ANSWERED TO THAT WORD HE CLOSED HIS EYELIDS CALDER WENT ON STILL MORE EAGERLY YOU WERE WOUNDED THERE NO WHERE THEN AT BERBER YES YOU WERE IN PRISON
6735-66412-0039 AT OMDURMAN AND ESCAPED NO YET YOU WERE WOUNDED CALDER SANK BACK UPON HIS KNEE AND REFLECTED HIS REFLECTIONS ROUSED IN HIM SOME EXCITEMENT
6735-66412-0040 YOU WERE HELPING SOME ONE TO ESCAPE YES WHO
6735-66412-0041 IT WAS EFFENDI FEVERSHAM THEN HE SAID AND THE EYES ASSENTED AS CLEARLY AS THOUGH THE LIPS HAD SPOKEN BUT THIS WAS ALL THE INFORMATION WHICH CALDER COULD SECURE I TOO AM PLEDGED TO HELP
6735-66412-0042 EFFENDI FEVERSHAM HE SAID BUT IN VAIN THE ARAB COULD NOT SPEAK HE COULD NOT SO MUCH AS TELL HIS NAME
6735-66412-0043 WHATEVER THOSE TWO MEN KNEW OR SUSPECTED THEY HAD NO MIND TO MEDDLE IN THE MATTER THEMSELVES AND THEY CLUNG CONSISTENTLY TO A STORY WHICH ABSOLVED THEM FROM RESPONSIBILITY
6735-66412-0044 KINSMEN OF THEIRS IN KOROSKO HEARING THAT THEY WERE TRAVELLING TO ASSOUAN HAD ASKED THEM TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE WOUNDED MAN WHO WAS A STRANGER TO THEM AND THEY HAD CONSENTED
6735-66412-0045 CALDER COULD GET NOTHING MORE EXPLICIT FROM THEM THAN THIS STATEMENT HOWEVER CLOSELY HE QUESTIONED THEM HE HAD UNDER HIS HAND THE INFORMATION WHICH HE DESIRED THE NEWS OF HARRY FEVERSHAM
6735-66412-0046 FOR WHICH DURRANCE ASKED BY EVERY MAIL BUT IT WAS HIDDEN FROM HIM IN A LOCKED BOOK HE STOOD BESIDE THE HELPLESS MAN UPON THE ANGAREB THERE HE WAS EAGER ENOUGH TO SPEAK
6735-66412-0047 BUT THE EXTREMITY OF WEAKNESS TO WHICH HE HAD SUNK LAID A FINGER UPON HIS LIPS
6735-66412-0048 WILL HE RECOVER CALDER ASKED AND THE DOCTORS SHOOK THEIR HEADS IN DOUBT THERE WAS A CHANCE PERHAPS A VERY SLIGHT CHANCE BUT AT THE BEST RECOVERY WOULD BE SLOW
6735-66412-0049 CALDER CONTINUED UPON HIS JOURNEY TO CAIRO AND EUROPE AN OPPORTUNITY OF HELPING HARRY FEVERSHAM HAD SLIPPED AWAY
