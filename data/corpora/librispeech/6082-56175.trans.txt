6082-56175-0000 IT WAS A BRIGHT CLEAR DAY AND SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD SOME OTHER GIRL TO WALK WITH HER FOR WHEN BY HERSELF SHE NEVER VENTURED BEYOND THE ENTRANCE TO THE PARK ALTHOUGH IF HER COUSIN OR ONE OF HER SCHOOL FRIENDS COULD GO WITH HER
6082-56175-0001 HER AUNT HAD NO OBJECTION TO HER WALKING IN THE PARK ITSELF ONE OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF HER FRIENDSHIP WITH RUTH ROBERTS LAY IN THE FACT THAT THEY COULD SELDOM BE TOGETHER IN THE AFTERNOONS THEIR HOMES WERE TOO FAR APART SOMETIMES ON SATURDAY
6082-56175-0002 JULIA WOULD GO TO ROXBURY TO SPEND THE HALF DAY WITH RUTH AND ON OTHER SATURDAYS RUTH WOULD COME IN TOWN TO STAY WITH JULIA IT WAS HARD TO TELL WHICH WAS THE PLEASANTER THING TO DO AT ROXBURY THERE WERE RUTH'S PONIES TO DRIVE
6082-56175-0003 AND IN SNOWY WEATHER A CHANCE TO COAST DOWN A QUIET SIDE STREET OUT OF TOWN THERE ARE MANY MORE CHANCES FOR FUN FOR GIRLS PAST SIXTEEN THAN CAN POSSIBLY BE FOUND IN TOWN OR THE CITY
6082-56175-0004 WHEN RUTH VISITED JULIA THE TWO USUALLY WENT TO A CONCERT ACCOMPANIED BY MISSUS BARLOW OR WHEN SHE COULD NOT GO BY ONE OF THEIR TEACHERS OF LATE JULIA HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF INVITING MISS SOUTH TO GO WITH THEM BRENDA NEVER WENT TO THESE CONCERTS
6082-56175-0005 THE ONLY MATINEE THAT SHE CARED FOR WAS THE THEATRE
6082-56175-0006 SHE COULD NOT INDULGE HERSELF HALF AS MUCH AS SHE WISHED ON THIS PARTICULAR AFTERNOON JULIA FELT ESPECIALLY LONELY DOUBTLESS NO SMALL PART OF HER LONELINESS CAME FROM THE FACT THAT SHE WAS PERFECTLY WELL AWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE FOUR IN THE HOUSE
6082-56175-0007 AND THOUGH SHE HAD TRIED NOT EVEN TO SAY TO HERSELF THAT SHE FELT SLIGHTED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS THAN HUMAN NOT TO FEEL THAT HER COUSIN HAD SLIGHTED HER IN NOT ASKING HER TO THE CLUB TO LOOK UP AND NOT DOWN TO LOOK OUT AND NOT IN
6082-56175-0008 HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LESSONS WHICH HER FATHER HAD BEEN MOST CAREFUL TO TEACH HER IT WAS THEREFORE NOT VERY OFTEN THAT SHE LET HER THOUGHTS DWELL TOO LONG ON HER OWN AFFAIRS BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY SHE FELT A LITTLE LOW SPIRITED
6082-56175-0009 WITHOUT REALIZING IT SHE HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE INTO THE PARK AND PAUSING TO ADMIRE A BIT OF DISTANT VIEW THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO GET FROM A SLIGHTLY ELEVATED POINT SHE LINGERED A MOMENT OR TWO LONGER
6082-56175-0010 WHEN SHE FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY OF SATISFYING HERSELF SHE WALKED UP TO THE BUSHES AND THERE STANDING FORLORNLY ON THREE LEGS WAS A TINY ITALIAN GREYHOUND WHY YOU POOR LITTLE THING SHE CRIED WHAT IS THE MATTER
6082-56175-0011 AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE TOOK THE LITTLE CREATURE IN HER ARMS IS YOUR LEG BROKEN OR SPRAINED OR WHAT SHE CONTINUED THOUGH OF COURSE SHE DID NOT EXPECT ANY REPLY FROM THE DOG THE GREYHOUND SHOWED GREAT JOY AT THE SOUND OF A FRIENDLY VOICE
6082-56175-0012 AND LOOKED UP IN JULIA'S FACE WITH AN EXPRESSION OF CONFIDENCE AND GRATITUDE COME I AM GOING TO PUT YOU DOWN ON THE GROUND FOR A MINUTE TO SEE WHETHER YOU ARE HURT OR ONLY PRETENDING SO SUITING THE ACTION TO THE WORD SHE STOOD THE LITTLE DOG ON ITS FEET
6082-56175-0013 AS IF UNDERSTANDING HER PURPOSE THE LITTLE CREATURE LIMPED IN FRONT OF HER FOR A FEW STEPS BUT THE LIMP WAS SO SLIGHT AS TO ASSURE JULIA THAT NO SERIOUS ACCIDENT HAD BEFALLEN THE LEG WHICH THE DOG STILL SEEMED INCLINED TO HOLD OFF THE GROUND
6082-56175-0014 NOW LET ME SEE IF YOUR COLLAR TELLS WHO YOUR OWNER IS ADDED JULIA AND SHE BENT DOWN TOWARDS THE DOG THERE TO HER SURPRISE SHE READ IN CLEAR LETTERS FIDESSA MADAME DU LAUNY
6082-56175-0015 NOW IMMEDIATELY JULIA DECIDED THAT THE OWNER OF THE DOG MUST BE THE MISTRESS OF THE LARGE HOUSE NEAR THE SCHOOL ABOUT WHICH HER FRIENDS WERE SO CURIOUS IN AN INSTANT TOO SHE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD SEEN THIS LITTLE ANIMAL OR ONE VERY LIKE IT
6082-56175-0016 TAKING ITS EXERCISE IN FRONT OF THE GREAT MYSTERIOUS HOUSE JULIA HAD ALWAYS BEEN FOND OF DOGS AND THE LITTLE TREMBLING CREATURE APPEALED STRONGLY TO HER FOR A MOMENT SHE ALMOST WISHED THAT THERE WERE NO NAME ON THE COLLAR
6082-56175-0017 SO THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE KEPT IT WITH HER FOR A DAY OR TWO WHILE FINDING THE OWNER O IF ONLY IT HAD NO OWNER WHAT JOY SHE THOUGHT AS SHE GAZED INTO ITS DARK EYES TO KEEP IT FOR MYSELF
6082-56175-0018 AND TAKING THE LITTLE FIDESSA IN HER ARMS SHE RETRACED HER STEPS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CITY WHERE MADAME DU LAUNY LIVED AS SHE STOOD IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE WHICH NORA AND BRENDA HAD TRIED SO UNSUCCESSFULLY TO ENTER A FEW WEEKS BEFORE
6082-56175-0019 THE OLD TIMIDITY WHICH AT ONE TIME HAD BEEN THE TRIAL OF HER LIFE RETURNED TO HER NEVERTHELESS SHE RANG THE BELL BRAVELY AND WAS WELCOMED ALMOST WITH OPEN ARMS BY THE SERIOUS FACED SERVANT WHO OPENED THE DOOR HE HAD SEEN FIDESSA INSTANTLY
6082-56175-0020 AND IF HE HAD NOT THE LITTLE CREATURE WOULD HAVE MADE HERSELF QUICKLY KNOWN WHEN JULIA RELEASED HER SHE JUMPED ABOUT IN THE GREATEST EXCITEMENT WHIRLING AROUND IN A CIRCLE AND THEN RUSHING AHEAD UP THE STAIRS ALL TRACE OF THE LAMENESS SEEMED TO BE GONE GREATLY TO JULIA'S SURPRISE
6082-56175-0021 WHILE FIDESSA WAS RUNNING AHEAD THE MAN ASKING JULIA TO FOLLOW HIM HAD SHOWN HER INTO A LARGE ROOM RATHER DIMLY LIGHTED AT FIRST SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS ALONE BUT FAR AT THE OTHER END OF THE APARTMENT
6082-56175-0022 SHE SAW A SLIGHT FIGURE ARISE FROM THE DEPTHS OF A LARGE ARMCHAIR AS THE MAN SAID SOLEMNLY MADAME DU LAUNY HERE IS A YOUNG LADY WHO HAS FOUND FIDESSA AT THAT MOMENT THE TRUANT DOG BOUNDED INTO THE ROOM
6082-56175-0023 AND LEAPING UP TOWARDS THE OLD LADY ALMOST KNOCKED HER OVER AT THE SAME MOMENT A PLAIN ELDERLY WOMAN ENTERED BEHIND FIDESSA AND JULIA COULD SEE AS SHE STOOD IN THE DOORWAY THAT HER EYES WERE RATHER RED AROUND THE EDGES AS IF SHE HAD BEEN WEEPING
6082-56175-0024 SAID MADAME DU LAUNY QUERULOUSLY WE ARE NOT AT A FUNERAL
6082-56175-0025 WHERE DID YOU FIND MY POOR LITTLE DOG BY THIS TIME THE POOR LITTLE DOG WAS SEATED CALMLY ON A CUSHION WITH ITS SLENDER FRONT LEGS CROSSED AS IF IT HAD NEVER GIVEN ANY ONE A MOMENT'S UNEASINESS
6082-56175-0026 AS JULIA LOOKED AT THE LADY WHO HAD ADDRESSED HER SHE SAW THAT SHE WAS OR HAD BEEN TALL HER FIGURE THOUGH SOMEWHAT BENT GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF STATELINESS THIS ASPECT WAS INCREASED BY THE LARGE TOWERING STRUCTURE WHICH SHE WORE ON HER HEAD
6082-56175-0027 WHETHER TO BE CALLED CAP OR TURBAN IT WAS HARD TO TELL
6082-56175-0028 IN ANSWER TO MADAME DU LAUNY'S QUESTION JULIA DESCRIBED FINDING THE LITTLE DOG IN THE PARK AND HER FEAR AT FIRST LEST IT HAD HURT ITS LEG THAT IS AN OLD TRICK OF FIDESSA SAID HER MISTRESS SMILING
6082-56175-0029 WHEN SHE IS AT ALL UNHAPPY SHE LIMPS ABOUT ON THREE LEGS AS IF REALLY LAME SHE DOES NOT KNOW HER WAY ABOUT THE CITY AND SHE IS NEVER SUPPOSED TO GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT HER LEASH
6082-56175-0030 FIDESSA WENT OUT FOR A DRIVE TO DAY UNDER HER CARE WHEN JANE LEFT THE CARRIAGE TO CALL ON A FRIEND OF HERS WHO LIVES NEAR THE PARK SHE FORGOT ALL ABOUT MY DOG FIDESSA PROBABLY JUMPED OUT OF THE CARRIAGE TO TAKE A WALK HERSELF
6082-56175-0031 BUT I MUST SAY THAT IT SEEMS MOST EXTRAORDINARY THAT NO ONE SAW HER NEITHER THE COACHMAN THE FOOTMAN NOR JANE WHEN THE CARRIAGE STARTED HOME NONE OF THEM TOOK THE TROUBLE TO LOOK UNDER THE RUGS TO SEE IF SHE WAS THERE
6082-56175-0032 HERE JANE BEGAN TO SNIFFLE A LITTLE WELL CONTINUED MADAME DU LAUNY IT IS A GREAT WONDER THAT SHE WAS NOT STOLEN OR RUN OVER POOR LITTLE THING IT'S NO THANKS TO YOU JANE
6082-56175-0033 AND SHE LOOKED DAGGERS AT THE UNFORTUNATE MAID IT IS A WONDER TOO THAT NONE OF YOU COULD FIND FIDESSA FOR I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE LITTLE THING WAS ACTUALLY HIDING AND YOU ALL THREE HAVE COME BACK WITH THE REPORT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND HER
6082-56175-0034 WHILE MADAME DU LAUNY WAS SPEAKING JULIA SAID TO HERSELF THAT SHE WOULD BE VERY SORRY TO BRING ON HERSELF A SCOLDING FROM SO SHARP VOICED AN OLD LADY AND SHE COULD NOT HELP FEELING SORRY FOR JANE EVEN THOUGH THE LATTER HAD PROBABLY BEEN CARELESS
6082-56175-0035 BUT NOW WITH A SUDDEN CHANGE OF MANNER MADAME DU LAUNY TURNED TOWARD THE YOUNG GIRL THERE IS NO REASON HOWEVER WHY YOU SHOULD SUFFER FOR JANE'S MISDEEDS
6082-56175-0036 AND THEN IN WHAT SEEMED AN INCREDIBLY SHORT TIME A MAN ENTERED WITH A BUTLER'S TRAY WHICH HE PLACED ON A TABLE IN FRONT OF MADAME DU LAUNY WHILE THE LATTER INVITED JULIA TO COME NEARER AND TAKE A CUP OF TEA NOW AS JULIA SAT THERE DRINKING TEA
6082-56175-0037 FROM THE QUAINTEST OF OLD FASHIONED CHINA CUPS AND EATING SLICES OF THIN BREAD AND BUTTER AND CAKES THAT ALMOST MELTED IN HER MOUTH SHE COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHAT HER FRIENDS AND HER COUSIN WOULD SAY TO SEE HER ACTUALLY SEATED IN THE HOUSE
6082-56175-0038 WHICH MOST OF THEM CONSIDERED ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO ENTER IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE CURTAINS AT ONE OR TWO WINDOWS HAD BEEN RAISED A LITTLE THE ROOM WAS STILL RATHER DARK AND AS SHE GLANCED ABOUT JULIA COULD SEE THE PICTURES AND FURNITURE RATHER INDISTINCTLY
6082-56175-0039 SHE NOTICED HOWEVER THAT ONE WALL WAS QUITE COVERED WITH LARGE PIECES OF TAPESTRY REPRESENTING MEDIEVAL BATTLE SCENES AND THAT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL ON EITHER SIDE OF A LONG MIRROR
6082-56175-0040 THAT MADAME DU LAUNY SHOULD PROVE TO BE ALTOGETHER LESS OF AN OGRE THAN SHE HAD BEEN REPRESENTED ALTHOUGH A TREMBLING HAND AND A RATHER WEAK VOICE BETRAYED HER AGE SHE TALKED BRIGHTLY OF VARIOUS THINGS ASKING JULIA ABOUT HER SCHOOL AND HER STUDIES
6082-56175-0041 AND DRAWING THE YOUNG GIRL OUT TO TALK ABOUT THE WESTERN COUNTRY IN WHICH SHE HAD SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON ONE SUBJECT HOWEVER THE OLD LADY WAS SILENT SHE SAID NOTHING IN PRAISE OF BOSTON EITHER ANCIENT OR MODERN
6082-56175-0042 SHE NEVER ALLUDED TO A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL AS MY FRIEND OR MY NEIGHBOR SHE SPOKE ONLY OF THINGS AND FOR THE MOST PART OF THINGS THAT HAD NO CONNECTION WITH NEW ENGLAND HER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCHOOL WERE EVIDENTLY PROMPTED BY POLITENESS
6082-56175-0043 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GENERAL RULE THAT ONE SHOULD SHOW AN INTEREST IN WHATEVER PROBABLY INTERESTS THE ONE
6082-56175-0044 AND JAMES WHO KEPT HIS POST NEAR THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR LOOKED IN AMAZEMENT ON MADAME DU LAUNY AND HER YOUNG GUEST IN ALL THEIR REMEMBRANCE AND BOTH HAD LIVED IN THE HOUSE MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS THEY HAD NEVER SEEN A YOUNG GIRL IN CONVERSATION WITH THEIR MISTRESS
6082-56175-0045 INDEED THEY HAD SEEN VERY FEW GUESTS IN THAT GLOOMY OLD DRAWING ROOM AND CERTAINLY THEY HAD NEVER KNOWN ANY ONE ELSE TO BE ASKED TO DRINK TEA IT WAS AS PLEASANT AS IT WAS NOVEL TO MADAME DU LAUNY TO HAVE JULIA SITTING WITH HER AND AS FOR FIDESSA
6082-56175-0046 SHE ALTOGETHER FORGOT THE STRICT DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN REARED AND INSTEAD OF SITTING CALMLY ON HER CUSHION SHE JUMPED UP IN JULIA'S LAP AND FROM TIME TO TIME PLANTED A COLD MOIST LITTLE KISS ON HER CHEEK WHEN AT LAST JULIA ROSE TO GO
6082-56175-0047 AND THAT SHE HAD SOME DISTANCE TO GO TO REACH HER UNCLE'S HOUSE WHEN HOWEVER SHE ROSE TO GO MADAME DU LAUNY BEGGED HER TO WAIT A MOMENT I HAVE ORDERED MY CARRIAGE SHE ADDED FOR IT IS ALTOGETHER TOO LATE FOR YOU TO GO HOME ALONE
6082-56175-0048 LET ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO MY LITTLE FIDESSA FOR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY SERIOUS LOSS FOR ME HAD SHE FALLEN INTO THE WRONG HANDS THEN WHEN SHE SAW JAMES RETURNING TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE CARRIAGE WAS READY SHE ADDED
6082-56175-0049 AND SPARE AN HOUR OR SO FOR ME YOU WILL ADD MORE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE TO RELIEVE MY VERY MONOTONOUS LIFE THUS JULIA
6082-56175-0050 FELT THAT SHE HAD MADE A NEW FRIEND AND IN A VERY UNEXPECTED WAY THE CARRIAGE IN WHICH SHE RODE HOME THOUGH OLD FASHIONED IN SHAPE WAS DELIGHTFULLY COMFORTABLE AND WHEN SHE DESCENDED FROM IT AT HER UNCLE'S DOOR STILL ANOTHER SURPRISE AWAITED HER
6082-56175-0051 THE FOOTMAN PLACED IN HER HAND A LITTLE BOX WITH MADAME DU LAUNY'S COMPLIMENTS HE SAID THIS WHEN SHE OPENED
6082-56175-0052 SHAPED LIKE A TINY SCIMITAR REALLY SHE THOUGHT I HAVE HAD A MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE BETTER THAN I DESERVE FOR IT WAS ONLY THIS AFTERNOON THAT I WAS FEELING SO CROSS AND SO DISHEARTENED BECAUSE THE FOUR WOULD NOT INCLUDE ME IN THE CLUB
6082-56175-0053 BUT IF I HAD BEEN WITH THEM THIS AFTERNOON
6082-56175-0054 WHY EVEN I IN ALL MY YEARS OF RESIDENCE HERE HAVE NEVER HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE OLD LADY I HAVE SOMETIMES THOUGHT IT A PITY THAT SHE SHOULD LEAD SO SOLITARY A LIFE BUT IT'S HER OWN CHOICE
6082-56175-0055 THEY SAY SHE HAS A REGULAR HERMIT DISPOSITION HOW DID IT STRIKE YOU JULIA NOT THAT WAY UNCLE AT ALL NOT AT ALL THOUGH SHE SEEMED VERY SAD
6082-56175-0056 INTERPOSED BRENDA ARE YOU SURE THAT THERE ARE ANY GRANDCHILDREN ENQUIRED MISSUS BARLOW
6082-56175-0057 ANSWERED BRENDA MISTER BARLOW LAUGHED I AM AFRAID THAT YOU CANNOT MAKE OUT A VERY STRONG CASE OF CRUELTY TO CHILDREN UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF THE CHILDREN OH WELL INTERPOSED MISSUS BARLOW
6082-56175-0058 TO PREVENT THAT RUFFLING OF BRENDA'S FEELINGS WHICH WAS SURE TO FOLLOW WHEN SHE FELT THAT SOME ONE WAS LAUGHING AT HER
