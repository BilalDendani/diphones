2992-164101-0000 WITHIN PELLUCIDAR ONE TIME IS AS GOOD AS ANOTHER THERE WERE NO NIGHTS TO MASK OUR ATTEMPTED ESCAPE ALL MUST BE DONE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT ALL BUT THE WORK I HAD TO DO IN THE APARTMENT BENEATH THE BUILDING
2992-164101-0001 SO WE DETERMINED TO PUT OUR PLAN TO AN IMMEDIATE TEST LEST THE MAHARS WHO MADE IT POSSIBLE SHOULD AWAKE BEFORE I REACHED THEM BUT WE WERE DOOMED TO DISAPPOINTMENT FOR NO SOONER HAD WE REACHED THE MAIN FLOOR OF THE BUILDING ON OUR WAY TO THE PITS BENEATH
2992-164101-0002 THAN WE ENCOUNTERED HURRYING BANDS OF SLAVES BEING HASTENED UNDER STRONG SAGOTH GUARD OUT OF THE EDIFICE TO THE AVENUE BEYOND OTHER SAGOTHS WERE DARTING HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF OTHER SLAVES
2992-164101-0003 WHAT THE PURPOSE OR NATURE OF THE GENERAL EXODUS WE DID NOT KNOW BUT PRESENTLY THROUGH THE LINE OF CAPTIVES RAN THE RUMOR THAT TWO ESCAPED SLAVES HAD BEEN RECAPTURED A MAN AND A WOMAN AND THAT WE WERE MARCHING TO WITNESS THEIR PUNISHMENT
2992-164101-0004 FOR THE MAN HAD KILLED A SAGOTH OF THE DETACHMENT THAT HAD PURSUED AND OVERTAKEN THEM AT THE INTELLIGENCE MY HEART SPRANG TO MY THROAT FOR I WAS SURE THAT THE TWO WERE OF THOSE WHO ESCAPED IN THE DARK GROTTO WITH HOOJA THE SLY ONE AND THAT DIAN MUST BE THE WOMAN
2992-164101-0005 GHAK THOUGHT SO TOO AS DID PERRY
2992-164101-0006 NAUGHT HE REPLIED
2992-164101-0007 AS THOUGH WE TOO HAD BEEN IMPLICATED IN THE MURDER OF THEIR FELLOW THE OCCASION WAS TO SERVE AS AN OBJECT LESSON TO ALL OTHER SLAVES OF THE DANGER AND FUTILITY OF ATTEMPTED ESCAPE AND THE FATAL CONSEQUENCES OF TAKING THE LIFE OF A SUPERIOR BEING
2992-164101-0008 AND SO I IMAGINE THAT SAGOTHS FELT AMPLY JUSTIFIED IN MAKING THE ENTIRE PROCEEDING AS UNCOMFORTABLE AND PAINFUL TO US AS POSSIBLE THEY JABBED US WITH THEIR SPEARS AND STRUCK AT US WITH THE HATCHETS AT THE LEAST PROVOCATION AND AT NO PROVOCATION AT ALL
2992-164101-0009 IT WAS A MOST UNCOMFORTABLE HALF HOUR THAT WE SPENT BEFORE WE WERE FINALLY HERDED THROUGH A LOW ENTRANCE INTO A HUGE BUILDING THE CENTER OF WHICH WAS GIVEN UP TO A GOOD SIZED ARENA BENCHES SURROUNDED THIS OPEN SPACE UPON THREE SIDES
2992-164101-0010 AND ALONG THE FOURTH WERE HEAPED HUGE BOWLDERS WHICH ROSE IN RECEDING TIERS TOWARD THE ROOF AT FIRST I COULDN'T MAKE OUT THE PURPOSE OF THIS MIGHTY PILE OF ROCK UNLESS IT WERE INTENDED AS A ROUGH AND PICTURESQUE BACKGROUND FOR THE SCENES WHICH WERE ENACTED IN THE ARENA BEFORE IT
2992-164101-0011 BUT PRESENTLY AFTER THE WOODEN BENCHES HAD BEEN PRETTY WELL FILLED BY SLAVES AND SAGOTHS I DISCOVERED THE PURPOSE OF THE BOWLDERS FOR THEN THE MAHARS BEGAN TO FILE INTO THE ENCLOSURE THEY MARCHED DIRECTLY ACROSS THE ARENA TOWARD THE ROCKS UPON THE OPPOSITE SIDE WHERE
2992-164101-0012 SPREADING THEIR BAT LIKE WINGS THEY ROSE ABOVE THE HIGH WALL OF THE PIT SETTLING DOWN UPON THE BOWLDERS ABOVE THESE WERE THE RESERVED SEATS THE BOXES OF THE ELECT
2992-164101-0013 REPTILES THAT THEY ARE THE ROUGH SURFACE OF A GREAT STONE IS TO THEM AS PLUSH AS UPHOLSTERY TO US HERE THEY LOLLED BLINKING THEIR HIDEOUS EYES AND DOUBTLESS CONVERSING WITH ONE ANOTHER IN THEIR SIXTH SENSE FOURTH DIMENSION LANGUAGE
2992-164101-0014 FOR THE FIRST TIME I BEHELD THEIR QUEEN SHE DIFFERED FROM THE OTHERS IN NO FEATURE THAT WAS APPRECIABLE TO MY EARTHLY EYES IN FACT ALL MAHARS LOOK ALIKE TO ME BUT WHEN SHE CROSSED THE ARENA AFTER THE BALANCE OF HER FEMALE SUBJECTS HAD FOUND THEIR BOWLDERS
2992-164101-0015 WHILE BEHIND CAME ANOTHER SCORE OF SAGOTH GUARDSMEN AT THE BARRIER THE SAGOTHS CLAMBERED UP THE STEEP SIDE WITH TRULY APELIKE AGILITY
2992-164101-0016 AND SETTLED DOWN UPON THE LARGEST BOWLDER OF THEM ALL IN THE EXACT CENTER OF THAT SIDE OF THE AMPHITHEATER WHICH IS RESERVED FOR THE DOMINANT RACE HERE SHE SQUATTED A MOST REPULSIVE AND UNINTERESTING QUEEN THOUGH DOUBTLESS QUITE AS WELL ASSURED OF HER BEAUTY AND DIVINE RIGHT TO RULE
2992-164101-0017 AS THE PROUDEST MONARCH OF THE OUTER WORLD AND THEN THE MUSIC STARTED MUSIC WITHOUT SOUND THE MAHARS CANNOT HEAR SO THE DRUMS AND FIFES AND HORNS OF EARTHLY BANDS ARE UNKNOWN AMONG THEM THE BAND CONSISTS OF A SCORE OR MORE MAHARS
2992-164101-0018 IT FILED OUT IN THE CENTER OF THE ARENA WHERE THE CREATURES UPON THE ROCKS MIGHT SEE IT AND THERE IT PERFORMED FOR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES THEIR TECHNIC CONSISTED IN WAVING THEIR TAILS AND MOVING THEIR HEADS IN A REGULAR SUCCESSION
2992-164101-0019 OF MEASURED MOVEMENTS RESULTING IN A CADENCE WHICH EVIDENTLY PLEASED THE EYE OF THE MAHAR AS THE CADENCE OF OUR OWN INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLEASES OUR EARS SOMETIMES THE BAND TOOK MEASURED STEPS IN UNISON TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER OR BACKWARD AND AGAIN FORWARD
2992-164101-0020 IT ALL SEEMED VERY SILLY AND MEANINGLESS TO ME BUT AT THE END OF THE FIRST PIECE THE MAHARS UPON THE ROCKS SHOWED THE FIRST INDICATIONS OF ENTHUSIASM THAT I HAD SEEN DISPLAYED BY THE DOMINANT RACE OF PELLUCIDAR THEY BEAT THEIR GREAT WINGS UP AND DOWN
2992-164101-0021 AND SMOTE THEIR ROCKY PERCHES WITH THEIR MIGHTY TAILS UNTIL THE GROUND SHOOK THEN THE BAND STARTED ANOTHER PIECE AND ALL WAS AGAIN AS SILENT AS THE GRAVE THAT WAS ONE GREAT BEAUTY ABOUT MAHAR MUSIC IF YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN TO LIKE A PIECE THAT WAS BEING PLAYED
2992-164101-0022 ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS SHUT YOUR EYES WHEN THE BAND HAD EXHAUSTED ITS REPERTORY IT TOOK WING AND SETTLED UPON THE ROCKS ABOVE AND BEHIND THE QUEEN THEN THE BUSINESS OF THE DAY WAS ON
2992-164101-0023 A MAN AND WOMAN WERE PUSHED INTO THE ARENA BY A COUPLE OF SAGOTH GUARDSMEN I LEANED FORWARD IN MY SEAT TO SCRUTINIZE THE FEMALE HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT SHE MIGHT PROVE TO BE ANOTHER THAN DIAN THE BEAUTIFUL
2992-164101-0024 HER BACK WAS TOWARD ME FOR A WHILE AND THE SIGHT OF THE GREAT MASS OF RAVEN HAIR PILED HIGH UPON HER HEAD FILLED ME WITH ALARM PRESENTLY A DOOR IN ONE SIDE OF THE ARENA WALL WAS OPENED TO ADMIT A HUGE SHAGGY BULL LIKE CREATURE
2992-164101-0025 A BOS WHISPERED PERRY EXCITEDLY HIS KIND ROAMED THE OUTER CRUST WITH THE CAVE BEAR AND THE MAMMOTH AGES AND AGES AGO WE HAVE BEEN CARRIED BACK A MILLION YEARS DAVID TO THE CHILDHOOD OF A PLANET IS IT NOT WONDROUS
2992-164101-0026 BUT I SAW ONLY THE RAVEN HAIR OF A HALF NAKED GIRL AND MY HEART STOOD STILL IN DUMB MISERY AT THE SIGHT OF HER NOR HAD I ANY EYES FOR THE WONDERS OF NATURAL HISTORY
2992-164101-0027 LAY IN STORE FOR THIS PRICELESS TREASURE OF THE STONE AGE WITH THE ADVENT OF THE BOS THEY CALL THE THING A THAG WITHIN PELLUCIDAR TWO SPEARS WERE TOSSED INTO THE ARENA AT THE FEET OF THE PRISONERS
2992-164101-0028 AS THE ANIMAL APPROACHED THE TWO BELLOWING AND PAWING THE GROUND WITH THE STRENGTH OF MANY EARTHLY BULLS ANOTHER DOOR DIRECTLY BENEATH US WAS OPENED
2992-164101-0029 I COULD NOT AT FIRST SEE THE BEAST FROM WHICH EMANATED THIS FEARSOME CHALLENGE BUT THE SOUND HAD THE EFFECT OF BRINGING THE TWO VICTIMS AROUND WITH A SUDDEN START AND THEN I SAW THE GIRL'S FACE SHE WAS NOT DIAN I COULD HAVE WEPT FOR RELIEF AND NOW AS THE TWO STOOD FROZEN IN TERROR
2992-164101-0030 I SAW THE AUTHOR OF THAT FEARSOME SOUND CREEPING STEALTHILY INTO VIEW IT WAS A HUGE TIGER SUCH AS HUNTED THE GREAT BOS THROUGH THE JUNGLES PRIMEVAL WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG IN CONTOUR AND MARKINGS IT WAS NOT UNLIKE THE NOBLEST OF THE BENGALS OF OUR OWN WORLD
2992-164101-0031 BUT AS ITS DIMENSIONS WERE EXAGGERATED TO COLOSSAL PROPORTIONS SO TOO WERE ITS COLORINGS EXAGGERATED ITS VIVID YELLOWS FAIRLY SCREAMED ALOUD ITS WHITES WERE AS EIDER DOWN ITS BLACKS GLOSSY AS THE FINEST ANTHRACITE COAL
2992-164101-0032 AND ITS COAT LONG AND SHAGGY AS A MOUNTAIN GOAT THAT IT IS A BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL THERE IS NO GAINSAYING BUT IF ITS SIZE AND COLORS ARE MAGNIFIED HERE WITHIN PELLUCIDAR SO IS THE FEROCITY OF ITS DISPOSITION
2992-164101-0033 ALL ARE MAN HUNTERS
2992-164101-0034 FOR THERE IS NO FLESH OR FISH WITHIN PELLUCIDAR THAT THEY WILL NOT EAT WITH RELISH IN THE CONSTANT EFFORTS WHICH THEY MAKE TO FURNISH THEIR HUGE CARCASSES WITH SUFFICIENT SUSTENANCE TO MAINTAIN THEIR MIGHTY THEWS
2992-164101-0035 UPON ONE SIDE OF THE DOOMED PAIR THE THAG BELLOWED AND ADVANCED AND UPON THE OTHER TARAG THE FRIGHTFUL CREPT TOWARD THEM WITH GAPING MOUTH AND DRIPPING FANGS THE MAN SEIZED THE SPEARS HANDING ONE OF THEM TO THE WOMAN
2992-164101-0036 AT THE SOUND OF THE ROARING OF THE TIGER THE BULL'S BELLOWING BECAME A VERITABLE FRENZY OF RAGEFUL NOISE NEVER IN MY LIFE HAD I HEARD SUCH AN INFERNAL DIN AS THE TWO BRUTES MADE AND TO THINK IT WAS ALL LOST UPON THE HIDEOUS REPTILES FOR WHOM THE SHOW WAS STAGED
2992-164101-0037 THE THAG WAS CHARGING NOW FROM ONE SIDE
2992-164101-0038 THE TWO PUNY THINGS STANDING BETWEEN THEM SEEMED ALREADY LOST BUT AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT THE BEASTS WERE UPON THEM THE MAN GRASPED HIS COMPANION BY THE ARM AND TOGETHER THEY LEAPED TO ONE SIDE WHILE THE FRENZIED CREATURES CAME TOGETHER LIKE LOCOMOTIVES IN COLLISION
2992-164101-0039 THERE ENSUED A BATTLE ROYAL WHICH FOR SUSTAINED AND FRIGHTFUL FEROCITY TRANSCENDS THE POWER OF IMAGINATION OR DESCRIPTION
2992-164101-0040 BUT EACH TIME THAT THE HUGE CAT TOUCHED THE GROUND HE RETURNED TO THE ENCOUNTER WITH APPARENTLY UNDIMINISHED STRENGTH AND SEEMINGLY INCREASED IRE
2992-164101-0041 BUT FINALLY I SAW THEM SEPARATE AND EACH CREEP STEALTHILY TOWARD ONE OF THE COMBATANTS THE TIGER WAS NOW UPON THE BULL'S BROAD BACK CLINGING TO THE HUGE NECK WITH POWERFUL FANGS WHILE ITS LONG STRONG TALONS RIPPED THE HEAVY HIDE INTO SHREDS AND RIBBONS
2992-164101-0042 FOR A MOMENT THE BULL STOOD BELLOWING AND QUIVERING WITH PAIN AND RAGE ITS CLOVEN HOOFS WIDESPREAD ITS TAIL LASHING VICIOUSLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND THEN IN A MAD ORGY OF BUCKING
2992-164101-0043 IT WENT CAREENING ABOUT THE ARENA IN FRENZIED ATTEMPT TO UNSEAT ITS RENDING RIDER IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THE GIRL AVOIDED THE FIRST MAD RUSH OF THE WOUNDED ANIMAL ALL ITS EFFORTS TO RID ITSELF OF THE TIGER SEEMED FUTILE
2992-164101-0044 A LITTLE OF THIS SO DISCONCERTED THE TIGER KNOCKING ITS BREATH FROM IT I IMAGINE THAT IT LOST ITS HOLD AND THEN QUICK AS A CAT THE GREAT THAG WAS UP AGAIN AND HAD BURIED THOSE MIGHTY HORNS DEEP IN THE TARAG'S ABDOMEN PINNING HIM TO THE FLOOR OF THE ARENA
2992-164101-0045 THE GREAT CAT CLAWED AT THE SHAGGY HEAD UNTIL EYES AND EARS WERE GONE AND NAUGHT BUT A FEW STRIPS OF RAGGED BLOODY FLESH REMAINED UPON THE SKULL YET THROUGH ALL THE AGONY OF THAT FEARFUL PUNISHMENT THE THAG STILL STOOD MOTIONLESS PINNING DOWN HIS ADVERSARY
2992-164101-0046 AND THEN THE MAN LEAPED IN SEEING THAT THE BLIND BULL WOULD BE THE LEAST FORMIDABLE ENEMY AND RAN HIS SPEAR THROUGH THE TARAG'S HEART AS THE ANIMAL'S FIERCE CLAWING CEASED
2992-164101-0047 RAN HEADLONG ACROSS THE ARENA WITH GREAT LEAPS AND BOUNDS HE CAME STRAIGHT TOWARD THE ARENA WALL DIRECTLY BENEATH WHERE WE SAT
2992-164101-0048 IN ONE OF HIS MIGHTY SPRINGS COMPLETELY OVER THE BARRIER INTO THE MIDST OF THE SLAVES AND SAGOTHS JUST IN FRONT OF US SWINGING HIS BLOODY HORNS FROM SIDE TO SIDE THE BEAST CUT A WIDE SWATH BEFORE HIM STRAIGHT UPWARD TOWARD OUR SEATS
2992-164101-0049 BEFORE HIM SLAVES AND GORILLA MEN FOUGHT IN MAD STAMPEDE TO ESCAPE THE MENACE OF THE CREATURE'S DEATH AGONIES FOR SUCH ONLY COULD THAT FRIGHTFUL CHARGE HAVE BEEN
2992-164101-0050 AFTER THE BEAST CLEARED THE WALL OF THE ARENA EACH INTENT UPON SAVING HIS OWN HIDE I RAN TO THE RIGHT PASSING SEVERAL EXITS CHOKED WITH THE FEAR MAD MOB THAT WERE BATTLING TO ESCAPE
2992-164101-0051 ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT AN ENTIRE HERD OF THAGS WAS LOOSE BEHIND THEM RATHER THAN A SINGLE BLINDED DYING BEAST
