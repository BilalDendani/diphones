5911-52164-0000 AND DOES NOT CARE FOR MANY HE IS TOO ABSTRACT TO ADD TO THE GAIETY OF SOCIAL GATHERINGS FOR THESE ARE BASED ON THE ENJOYMENT OF THE CONCRETE ENJOYS THE INTELLECTUALS READERS THINKERS WRITERS
5911-52164-0001 INTELLECTUALS LIKE HIMSELF ARE THE KINDS OF PEOPLE THE CEREBRAL ENJOYS MOST ANOTHER REASON WHY HE HAS FEW FRIENDS IS BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE BEING IN THE GREAT MINORITY ARE NOT EASY TO FIND IGNORES THE IGNORANT
5911-52164-0002 PEOPLE WHO LET OTHERS DO THEIR THINKING FOR THEM AND THOSE WHO ARE NOT AWARE OF THE GREAT THINGS GOING ON IN WORLD MOVEMENTS ARE NOT POPULAR WITH THIS TYPE HE SOMETIMES HAS A SECRET CONTEMPT FOR THEM
5911-52164-0003 AND IGNORES THEM AS COMPLETELY AS THEY IGNORE HIM AVOIDS THE LIMELIGHT MODESTY AND RESERVE ALMOST AS MARKED IN THE MEN AS IN THE WOMEN CHARACTERIZE THIS EXTREME TYPE
5911-52164-0004 THEY DO THINGS OF GREAT MOMENT SOMETIMES INVENT SOMETHING OR WRITE SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY BUT EVEN THEN THEY TRY TO AVOID BEING LIONIZED THEY PREFER THE SHADOWS RATHER THAN THE SPOTLIGHT THUS
5911-52164-0005 THEY MISS MANY OF THE GOOD THINGS LESS BRAINY AND MORE AGGRESSIVE PEOPLE GAIN BUT IT DOES NO GOOD TO EXPLAIN THIS TO A CEREBRAL HE ENJOYS RETIREMENT AND IS CONSTANTLY MISSING OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE HE REFUSES TO MIX
5911-52164-0006 HE WILL GO AWAY FROM HIS ROOM LEAVING EVERY CENT HE OWNS LYING ON THE DRESSER AND THEN FORGET TO LOCK THE DOOR THIS TYPE OF PERSON ALMOST NEVER ASKS FOR A RAISE HE IS TOO BUSY DREAMING DREAMS TO PLAN WHAT HE WILL DO IN HIS OLD AGE
5911-52164-0007 HE PREFERS STAYING AT THE SAME JOB WITH CONGENIAL ASSOCIATES TO FINDING ANOTHER EVEN IF IT PAID MORE VERY OFTEN POOR SINCE WE GET ONLY WHAT WE GO AFTER IN THIS WORLD IT FOLLOWS THAT THE CEREBRAL IS OFTEN POOR
5911-52164-0008 HISTORY SHOWS THAT FEW PEOPLE OF THE PURE CEREBRAL TYPE EVER BECAME RICH EVEN THE MOST BRILLIANT GAVE SO MUCH MORE THOUGHT TO THEIR MISSION THAN THE PRACTICAL WAYS AND MEANS THAT THEY WERE USUALLY SERIOUSLY HANDICAPPED FOR THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO ITS MATERIALIZATION
5911-52164-0009 MADAME CURIE CO DISCOVERER OF RADIUM SAID TO BE THE GREATEST LIVING WOMAN OF THIS TYPE IS WORLD FAMOUS AND HAS DONE HUMANITY A NOBLE SERVICE BUT HER EXPERIMENTS WERE ALWAYS CARRIED ON AGAINST GREAT DISADVANTAGES
5911-52164-0010 BECAUSE SHE HAD NOT THE FINANCIAL MEANS TO PURCHASE MORE THAN THE MOST LIMITED QUANTITIES OF THE PRECIOUS SUBSTANCE ABOUT CLOTHES CLOTHES ARE ALMOST THE LAST THING THE CEREBRAL THINKS ABOUT
5911-52164-0011 ALL THE OTHER TYPES HAVE DECIDED PREFERENCES AS TO THEIR CLOTHES THE ALIMENTIVE DEMANDS COMFORT THE THORACIC STYLE THE MUSCULAR DURABILITY AND THE OSSEOUS SAMENESS BUT THE EXTREME CEREBRAL TYPE SAYS ANYTHING WILL DO
5911-52164-0012 SO WE OFTEN SEE HIM WITH A COAT OF ONE COLOR TROUSERS OF ANOTHER AND A HAT OF ANOTHER WITH NO GLOVES AT ALL AND HIS TIE MISSING OFTEN ABSENT MINDED WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID PEOPLE WERE ABSENT MINDED WHEN THEIR MINDS WERE ABSENT FROM WHAT THEY WERE DOING
5911-52164-0013 THIS OFTEN APPLIES TO THE CEREBRAL FOR HE IS CAPABLE OF GREATER CONCENTRATION THAN OTHER TYPES ALSO HE IS SO FREQUENTLY COMPELLED TO DO THINGS IN WHICH HE HAS NO INTEREST THAT HIS MIND NATURALLY WANDERS TO THE THINGS HE CARES ABOUT
5911-52164-0014 A CEREBRAL PROFESSOR WHOM WE KNOW SOMETIMES APPEARED BEFORE HIS HARVARD CLASSES IN BEDROOM SLIPPERS A THORACIC WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO LET HIS OWN BROTHER CATCH HIM IN HIS WRITES BETTER THAN HE TALKS
5911-52164-0015 THE POOR TALKER SOMETIMES SURPRISES US BY BEING A GOOD WRITER SUCH A ONE IS USUALLY OF THE CEREBRAL TYPE HE LIKES TO THINK OUT EVERY PHASE OF A THING AND PUT IT INTO JUST THE RIGHT WORDS BEFORE GIVING IT TO THE WORLD
5911-52164-0016 SO MANY A CEREBRAL WHO DOES LITTLE TALKING OUTSIDE HIS INTIMATE CIRCLE DOES A GOOD DEAL OF SURREPTITIOUS WRITING IT MAY BE ONLY THE KEEPING OF A DIARY JOTTING DOWN MEMORANDA OR WRITING LONG LETTERS TO HIS FRIENDS BUT HE WILL WRITE SOMETHING
5911-52164-0017 SOME OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST IDEAS HAVE COME TO LIGHT FIRST IN THE FORGOTTEN MANUSCRIPTS OF PEOPLE OF THIS TYPE WHO DIED WITHOUT SHOWING THEIR WRITINGS TO ANY ONE EVIDENTLY THEY DID NOT CONSIDER THEM OF SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE OR DID NOT CARE AS MUCH ABOUT PUBLISHING THEM
5911-52164-0018 AN INVETERATE READER STEP INTO THE REFERENCE ROOMS OF YOUR CITY LIBRARY ON A SUMMER'S DAY AND YOU WILL STAND MORE CHANCE OF FINDING EXAMPLES OF THIS EXTREME TYPE THERE THAN IN ANY OTHER SPOT
5911-52164-0019 YOU MAY HAVE THOUGHT THESE EXTREME TYPES ARE DIFFICULT TO LOCATE SINCE THE AVERAGE AMERICAN IS A COMBINATION BUT IT IS EASY TO FIND ANY OF THEM
5911-52164-0020 IN EVERY CASE YOU WILL FIND THEM IN THE VERY PLACES WHERE A STUDY OF HUMAN ANALYSIS WOULD TELL YOU TO LOOK FOR THEM WHERE TO LOOK FOR PURE TYPES WHEN YOU WISH TO FIND SOME PURE ALIMENTIVES
5911-52164-0021 GO TO A RESTAURANT THAT IS FAMOUS FOR ITS RICH FOODS WHEN YOU WANT TO SEE SEVERAL EXTREME THORACICS DROP INTO ANY VAUDEVILLE SHOW AND TAKE YOUR CHOICE FROM THE ACTORS OR FROM THE AUDIENCE WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING FOR PURE MUSCULARS
5911-52164-0022 GO TO A BOXING MATCH OR A PRIZE FIGHT AND YOU WILL BE SURROUNDED BY THEM WHEN LOOKING FOR THE OSSEOUS ATTEND A CONVENTION OF EXPERT ACCOUNTANTS BANKERS LUMBERMEN HARDWARE MERCHANTS OR PIONEERS ALL THESE TYPES APPEAR IN OTHER PLACES
5911-52164-0023 AND IN OTHER VOCATIONS BUT THEY ARE CERTAIN TO BE PRESENT IN LARGE NUMBERS ANY DAY IN ANY OF THE ABOVE NAMED PLACES BUT WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THIS INTERESTING LITTLE EXTREME THINKER TYPE YOU MUST GO TO A LIBRARY
5911-52164-0024 WE SPECIFY THE REFERENCE ROOM OF THE LIBRARY BECAUSE THOSE WHO SEARCH FOR FICTION NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES ARE NOT NECESSARILY OF THE PURE TYPE
5911-52164-0025 RATHER THAN IN WINTER SO THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SELECT YOUR SUBJECTS FROM AMONGST PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE IN SPITE OF THE WEATHER RATHER THAN BECAUSE OF IT INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING I NEVER SAW A BOOK WITHOUT WANTING TO READ IT
5911-52164-0026 SAID A CEREBRAL FRIEND TO US THE OTHER DAY THIS EXPRESSES THE INTEREST EVERY PERSON OF THIS TYPE HAS IN THE PRINTED PAGE
5911-52164-0027 HE IS SOON DEVOURING BOOKS FOR OLDER HEADS WHY WON'T HE RUN AND PLAY LIKE OTHER CHILDREN WAILS MOTHER AND THAT BOY OUGHT TO BE MADE TO JOIN THE BALL TEAM SCOLDS FATHER BUT THAT BOY CONTINUES TO KEEP HIS NOSE IN A BOOK
5911-52164-0028 HE CAN TALK ON ALMOST ANY SUBJECT WHEN HE WILL
5911-52164-0029 BUT THE CEREBRAL IS BORN OLD FROM INFANCY HE SHOWS MORE MATURITY THAN OTHER CHILDREN THE TEACHER'S PET HIS STUDIOUSNESS AND TRACTABLENESS LEAD TO ONE REWARD IN CHILDHOOD THOUGH IT OFTEN COSTS HIM DEAR AS A MAN
5911-52164-0030 HE USUALLY BECOMES THE TEACHER'S FAVORITE AND NO WONDER HE ALWAYS HAS HIS LESSONS HE GIVES HER LITTLE TROUBLE AND IS ABOUT ALL THAT KEEPS MANY A TEACHER AT HER POORLY PAID POST LITTLE SENSE OF TIME
5911-52164-0031 THE EXTREME CEREBRAL OFTEN HAS A DEFICIENT SENSE OF TIME HE IS LESS CONSCIOUS OF THE PASSAGE OF THE HOURS THAN ANY OTHER TYPE THE MUSCULAR AND THE OSSEOUS OFTEN HAVE AN ALMOST UNCANNY TIME SENSE BUT THE EXTREME CEREBRAL MAN OFTEN LACKS IT
5911-52164-0032 FORGETTING TO WIND HIS WATCH OR TO CONSULT IT FOR HOURS WHEN HE DOES IS A FAMILIAR HABIT OF THIS TYPE WE KNOW A BRIDE IN DETROIT WHOSE FLAT LOOKED OUT ON A BAKERY AND A BOOKSTORE
5911-52164-0033 SHE TOLD US THAT SHE USED TO SEND HER CEREBRAL HUBBY ACROSS THE STREET FOR THE LOAF OF BREAD THAT WAS FOUND LACKING JUST AS THEY WERE READY TO SIT DOWN TO DINNER ONLY TO WAIT HOURS AND THEN HAVE HIM COME BACK WITH A BOOK UNDER HIS ARM NO BREAD AND NO REALIZATION OF HOW LONG HE HAD BEEN GONE
5911-52164-0034 INCLINED TO BE UNORTHODOX OTHER TYPES TEND TO FOLLOW VARIOUS RELIGIONS ACCORDING TO THE INDIVIDUAL'S UPBRINGING BUT THE CEREBRAL COMPOSES A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE UNORTHODOX THE POLITICAL REFORMER
5911-52164-0035 BECAUSE ALL FORMS OF PERSONAL COMBAT ARE DISTASTEFUL TO HIM THE PURE CEREBRAL DOES NOT GO OUT AND FIGHT FOR REFORM AS OFTEN AS THE MUSCULAR NOR DIE FOR CAUSES AS OFTEN AS THE OSSEOUS TYPES BUT ALMOST EVERY CEREBRAL BELIEVES IN EXTREME REFORMS OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER
5911-52164-0036 THIS TYPE IS USUALLY SUFFICIENTLY INTELLIGENT TO KNOW THE WORLD NEEDS REFORMING AND SUFFICIENTLY CONSCIENTIOUS TO WANT TO HELP TO DO IT HE IS NOT BOUND BY TRADITIONS OR CUSTOMS AS MUCH AS OTHER TYPES BUT DOES MORE OF HIS OWN THINKING
5911-52164-0037 THE SOCIAL NONCONFORMIST
5911-52164-0038 THIS LITTLE MAN WITH THE BIG HEAD MAY NOT OPENLY CHALLENGE YOU OR ARGUE WITH YOU WHEN YOU STAND UP FOR THINGS AS THEY ARE FOR HE IS A PEACEABLE CHAP BUT HE INWARDLY SMILES OR SNEERS AT WHAT HE CONSIDERS YOUR TROGLODYTE IDEAS
5911-52164-0039 HE SEES A DAY COMING WHEN BABIES WILL BE NAMED FOR THEIR FATHERS WHETHER THE MINISTER OFFICIATED OR NOT
5911-52164-0040 WILL HIMSELF BE A HAZY MYTH AND WHEN SOCIETY IDLERS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN PEOPLE WHO EARN THEIR LIVINGS THE WORLD'S PATHFINDER THE CEREBRAL THEREFORE LEADS THE WORLD IN IDEAS
5911-52164-0041 THE WORLD IS MANAGED BY FAT MEN ENTERTAINED BY FLORID MEN BUILT BY MUSCULAR MEN OPPOSED BY BONY MEN
5911-52164-0042 THESE THINKERS HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME OF IT THEY PREACH TO DEAF EARS AND OFTEN THEY DIE IN POVERTY BUT AT LAST POSTERITY COMES AROUND TO THEIR WAY OF THINKING ABANDONS THE OLD RUTS AND FOLLOWS THE TRAILS THEY HAVE BLAZED
5911-52164-0043 THEREFORE MANY GREAT THINKERS WHO WERE UNKNOWN WHILE ALIVE BECAME FAMOUS AFTER DEATH MORE OFTEN THAN NOT FAME IS THE FOOD OF THE TOMB INDIFFERENCE TO SURROUNDINGS
5911-52164-0044 A WISE MAN IT WAS WHO SAID LET ME SEE A MAN'S SURROUNDINGS AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT HE IS THE CEREBRAL DOES NOT REALLY LIVE IN HIS HOUSE BUT IN HIS HEAD
5911-52164-0045 AND FOR THAT REASON DOES NOT FEEL AS GREAT AN URGE TO DECORATE AMPLIFY OR EVEN FURNISH THE PLACE IN WHICH HE DWELLS STEP INTO THE ROOM OF ANY LITTLE BODIED LARGE HEADED MAN AND YOU WILL BE STRUCK BY TWO FACTS
5911-52164-0046 THAT HE HAS FEWER JIMCRACKS AND MORE JOURNALS LYING AROUND THAN THE REST OF YOUR FRIENDS IN THE ROOM OF THE ALIMENTIVE YOU WILL FIND CUSHIONS SOFAS AND EATS IN THAT OF THE THORACIC YOU WILL FIND COLORFUL UNUSUAL THINGS
5911-52164-0047 THE MUSCULAR WILL HAVE DURABLE SOLID PLAIN THINGS THE OSSEOUS WILL HAVE FEWER OF EVERYTHING BUT WHAT HE DOES HAVE WILL BE IN ORDER BUT THE PURE CEREBRAL'S FURNISHINGS IF HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM WILL BE AN INDIFFERENT ARRAY
5911-52164-0048 BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE EXTREME CEREBRAL TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL OFTEN DIES AT AN EARLY AGE THE REASON IS CLEAR AN EFFICIENT BUT CONTROLLED ASSIMILATIVE SYSTEM IS THE FIRST REQUISITE FOR LONG LIFE AND THE PURE CEREBRAL
5911-52164-0049 THAT MORE DEATHS ARE CAUSED ANNUALLY IN AMERICA BY OVER EATING THAN BY ANY OTHER TWO CAUSES UNDER EATING IS A VERY NECESSARY PRECAUTION BUT THE CEREBRAL CARRIES IT TOO FAR THE CEREBRAL LACKING A LARGE ALIMENTARY SYSTEM
5911-52164-0050 HE IS NOT ADDICTED TO LATE HOURS WINE WOMEN OR EXCITEMENT DISEASES HE IS MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO NERVOUS DISEASES OF ALL KINDS MOST FREQUENTLY AFFLICT THIS TYPE HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM IS SUPERSENSITIVE
5911-52164-0051 IT BREAKS DOWN MORE EASILY AND MORE COMPLETELY
5911-52164-0052 JUST AS A HIGH POWERED CAR IS MORE EASILY WRECKED THAN A TRUCK MUSIC HE LIKES HIGHBROW MUSIC IS KEPT ALIVE MOSTLY BY HIGHBROWS
5911-52164-0053 WHILE THE OTHER TYPES CULTIVATE A TASTE FOR GRAND OPERA OR SIMULATE IT BECAUSE IT IS SUPPOSEDLY PROPER THE CEREBRAL REALLY ENJOYS IT IN THE TOP GALLERY AT ANY GOOD CONCERT YOU WILL FIND MANY CEREBRALS
5911-52164-0054 THE KIND OF PROGRAM THAT KEEPS THE FAT MAN'S SMILE SPREAD FROM EAR TO EAR TAKES THE CEREBRAL TO THE BOX OFFICE FOR HIS MONEY A STEADY PATRON AT THE MOVIES THE CEREBRAL GOES TO THE MOVIES MORE THAN ANY OTHER TYPE SAVE THE FAT MAN
5911-52164-0055 BUT NOT FOR THE SAME REASONS THE LARGE BRAINED SMALL BODIED MAN CARES NOTHING FOR MOST OF THE RECREATIONS WITH WHICH THE OTHER TYPES AMUSE THEMSELVES SO THE THEATER IS ALMOST HIS ONLY DIVERSION
5911-52164-0056 IT IS OFTENTIMES THE ONLY KIND OF ENTERTAINMENT WITHIN THE REACH OF HIS PURSE AND IT DEALS WITH MANY DIFFERENT SUBJECTS IN ALMOST ALL OF WHICH THE PURE CEREBRAL HAS SOME INTEREST DON'T LAUGH AT SAME THINGS
5911-52164-0057 BUT IF YOU WILL NOTICE NEXT TIME YOU GO TO A MOVIE IT WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU THAT THE FAT PEOPLE AND THE LARGE HEADED PEOPLE DO NOT LAUGH AT THE SAME THINGS THE PIE THROWING AND CUTEY COQUETTE THAT CONVULSE THE TWO HUNDRED POUNDER
5911-52164-0058 FAIL TO SO MUCH AS TURN UP THE CORNERS OF THE OTHER MAN'S MOUTH AND THE SUBTLE THINGS THAT AMUSE THE CEREBRAL GO OVER THE HEADS OF THE PURE ALIMENTIVES CARES FOR NO SPORTS
5911-52164-0059 NEITHER OF THEM CARES FOR STRENUOUS SPORTS THE FAT MAN DISLIKES THEM BECAUSE HE IS TOO HEAVY ON HIS FEET THE CEREBRAL DISLIKES THEM BECAUSE HE IS TOO HEAVY AT THE OPPOSITE EXTREMITY
5911-52164-0060 THE CEREBRAL IS THE MOST IMPERSONAL OF ALL TYPES WHILE THE ALIMENTIVE TENDS TO MEASURE EVERYTHING FROM THE STANDPOINT OF WHAT IT CAN DO FOR HIM PERSONALLY THE CEREBRAL TENDS TO THINK MORE IMPERSONALLY AND TO BE INTERESTED IN MANY THINGS OUTSIDE OF HIS OWN AFFAIRS
5911-52164-0061 LACKS PUGNACITY PRIMITIVE THINGS OF EVERY KIND ARE DISTASTEFUL TO THE CEREBRAL THE INSTINCTS OF DIGESTION SEX HUNTING AND PUGNACITY ARE BUT LITTLE DEVELOPED IN HIM
5911-52164-0062 HE IS THEREFORE A MAN WHO LIKES HARMONY AVOIDS COMING TO BLOWS AND GOES OUT OF HIS WAY TO KEEP THE PEACE SUCH A MAN DOES NOT GO HUNTING AND SELDOM OWNS A GUN HE DISLIKES TO KILL OR HARM ANY CREATURE
5911-52164-0063 THE CLEVEREST CROOK THE CEREBRAL IS USUALLY A NATURALLY MORAL PERSON BUT WHEN LACKING IN CONSCIENCE EITHER THROUGH BAD TRAINING OR OTHER CAUSES HE OCCASIONALLY TURNS TO CRIME FOR HIS INCOME
5911-52164-0064 THIS IS BECAUSE HIS PHYSICAL FRAILTY MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO DO HEAVY WORK WHILE HIS MENTALITY ENABLES HIM TO THINK OUT WAYS AND MEANS OF GETTING A LIVING WITHOUT IT THOUGH THE CLUMSY CRIMINAL MAY BELONG TO ANY TYPE
5911-52164-0065 THE CLEVEREST CROOKS THOSE WHO DEFY DETECTION FOR YEARS ALWAYS HAVE A LARGE ELEMENT OF THE CEREBRAL IN THEIR MAKEUP BIG BRAINS IN LITTLE JOBS
5911-52164-0066 AND LEADS A PRECARIOUS EXISTENCE WORKING IN THE LIGHTER INDOOR POSITIONS REQUIRING THE LEAST MENTALITY IF YOU WILL KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN YOU WILL MANY TIMES NOTE THAT THE LITTLE WAITER IN THE HIGH CLASS RESTAURANT OR HOTEL HAS A HEAD VERY LARGE FOR HIS BODY
5911-52164-0067 SUCH MEN ARE MUCH BETTER READ HAVE A FAR GREATER APPRECIATION OF ART AND LITERATURE AND MORE NATURAL REFINEMENT THAN THE PORKY PATRONS THEY SERVE SOCIAL ASSETS
5911-52164-0068 TOO GREAT RESERVE AND TOO MUCH ABSTRACTNESS IN CONVERSATION ARE THE THINGS THAT HANDICAP THE CEREBRAL HIS SMALL STATURE AND TIMID AIR ALSO ADD TO HIS APPEARANCE OF INSIGNIFICANCE AND CAUSE HIM TO BE OVERLOOKED AT SOCIAL AFFAIRS EMOTIONAL ASSETS
5911-52164-0069 SYMPATHY GENTLENESS AND SELF SACRIFICE ARE OTHER ASSETS OF THIS TYPE EMOTIONAL LIABILITIES A TENDENCY TO NERVOUS EXCITEMENT AND TO A LACK OF BALANCE ARE THE CHIEF EMOTIONAL HANDICAPS OF THIS TYPE
5911-52164-0070 BUSINESS LIABILITIES HIS INABILITY TO KEEP HIS FEET ON THE GROUND AND HIS TENDENCY TO LIVE IN THE CLOUDS AND TO BE GENERALLY IMPRACTICAL UNFIT THIS TYPE FOR BUSINESS LIFE DOMESTIC STRENGTH
5911-52164-0071 TENDERNESS CONSIDERATION AND IDEALISM ARE THE CHIEF DOMESTIC ASSETS OF THE CEREBRAL TYPE DOMESTIC WEAKNESS
5911-52164-0072 SHOULD AIM AT THIS MAN SHOULD AIM AT BUILDING UP HIS BODY AND PRACTICALIZING HIS MENTAL PROCESSES SHOULD AVOID THE CEREBRAL SHOULD AVOID SHALLOW IGNORANT PEOPLE SPECULATION
5911-52164-0073 AND THOSE SITUATIONS THAT CARRY HIM FARTHER AWAY FROM THE REAL WORLD HIS STRONG POINTS HIS THINKING CAPACITY PROGRESSIVENESS UNSELFISHNESS AND HIGHLY CIVILIZED INSTINCTS ARE THE STRONGEST POINTS OF THIS TYPE HIS WEAKEST POINTS
5911-52164-0074 IMPRACTICALITY DREAMINESS PHYSICAL FRAILTY AND HIS TENDENCY TO PLAN WITHOUT DOING ARE THE TRAITS WHICH STAND IN THE WAY OF HIS SUCCESS HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS TYPE SOCIALLY DON'T EXPECT HIM TO BE A SOCIAL LION DON'T EXPECT HIM TO MINGLE WITH MANY
5911-52164-0075 LEAVE HIM ALONE HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS TYPE IN BUSINESS DON'T EMPLOY THIS MAN FOR HEAVY MANUAL LABOR OR WHERE THERE IS MORE ARM WORK THAN HEAD WORK GIVE HIM MENTAL POSITIONS OR NONE IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH HIM AS A TRADESMAN
5911-52164-0076 RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS IMPRACTICALITY AND DON'T TREAT HIM AS IF YOU THOUGHT MONEY WAS EVERYTHING REMEMBER THE CHIEF DISTINGUISHING MARKS OF THE CEREBRAL IN THE ORDER OF THEIR IMPORTANCE ARE THE HIGH FOREHEAD
5911-52164-0077 AND A PROPORTIONATELY LARGE HEAD FOR THE BODY ANY PERSON WHO HAS THESE IS LARGELY OF THE CEREBRAL TYPE NO MATTER WHAT OTHER TYPES MAY BE INCLUDED IN HIS MAKEUP TO UNDERSTAND COMBINATIONS
5911-52164-0078 IN DOING THIS IT WILL AID YOU IF YOU WILL NOTE WHETHER FAT BONE OR MUSCLE PREDOMINATES IN HIS BODILY STRUCTURE SECOND DECIDE WHICH OF THE FIVE TYPICAL FACES HIS FACE MOST RESEMBLES THIRD
5911-52164-0079 HAVING DECIDED WHICH TYPE PREDOMINATES AND WHICH IS SECOND IN HIM THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS COMBINATION IS MADE CLEAR TO YOU BY THE FOLLOWING LAW LAW OF COMBINATION THE TYPE
5911-52164-0080 PREDOMINATING IN A PERSON DETERMINES WHAT HE DOES THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE THE NATURE OF HIS MAIN ACTIVITIES THE TYPE WHICH COMES SECOND IN DEVELOPMENT WILL DETERMINE THE WAY HE DOES THINGS THE METHODS HE WILL FOLLOW IN DOING WHAT HIS PREDOMINANT TYPE SIGNIFIES
5911-52164-0081 THE THIRD ELEMENT IF NOTICEABLE MERELY FLAVORS HIS PERSONALITY THUS A CEREBRAL MUSCULAR ALIMENTIVE DOES MENTAL THINGS PREDOMINANTLY THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE BUT IN A MORE MUSCULAR WAY THAN IF HE WERE AN EXTREME CEREBRAL
