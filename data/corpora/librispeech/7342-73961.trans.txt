7342-73961-0000 CHAPTER TEN SEPTEMBER SOWING SWEET PEAS AUTUMN SOWN ANNUALS DAHLIAS WORTHLESS KINDS
7342-73961-0001 STAKING PLANTING THE ROCK GARDEN GROWING SMALL PLANTS IN A WALL THE OLD WALL DRY WALLING HOW BUILT
7342-73961-0002 HOW PLANTED HYSSOP A DESTRUCTIVE STORM BERRIES OF WATER ELDER BEGINNING GROUND WORK
7342-73961-0003 IN THE SECOND WEEK OF SEPTEMBER WE SOW SWEET PEAS IN SHALLOW TRENCHES THE FLOWERS FROM THESE ARE LARGER AND STRONGER
7342-73961-0004 LOVE IN A MIST LARKSPURS POT MARIGOLD VIRGINIAN STOCK AND THE DELIGHTFUL VENUS'S NAVEL WORT
7342-73961-0005 AND GREY BLUE LEAF AND NEAT HABIT OF GROWTH ANY ONE WHO HAS NEVER BEFORE TRIED ANNUALS AUTUMN SOWN WOULD BE ASTONISHED AT THEIR VIGOUR A SINGLE PLANT OF NEMOPHILA WILL OFTEN COVER A SQUARE YARD
7342-73961-0006 WITH ITS BEAUTIFUL BLUE BLOOM AND THEN WHAT A GAIN IT IS TO HAVE THESE PRETTY THINGS IN FULL STRENGTH IN SPRING AND EARLY SUMMER INSTEAD OF WAITING TO HAVE THEM IN A MUCH POORER STATE LATER IN THE YEAR
7342-73961-0007 WHEN OTHER FLOWERS ARE IN PLENTY HARDY POPPIES SHOULD BE SOWN EVEN EARLIER AUGUST IS THE BEST TIME DAHLIAS ARE NOW AT THEIR FULL GROWTH
7342-73961-0008 TO MAKE A CHOICE FOR ONE'S OWN GARDEN ONE MUST SEE THE WHOLE PLANT GROWING AS WITH MANY ANOTHER KIND OF FLOWER NOTHING IS MORE MISLEADING THAN THE EVIDENCE OF THE SHOW TABLE
7342-73961-0009 COME FROM PLANTS THAT ARE OF NO GARDEN VALUE FOR HOWEVER CHARMING IN HUMANITY IS THE VIRTUE MODESTY AND HOWEVER BECOMING IS THE UNOBTRUSIVE BEARING THAT GIVES EVIDENCE OF ITS POSSESSION
7342-73961-0010 IT IS QUITE MISPLACED IN A DAHLIA HERE IT BECOMES A VICE FOR THE DAHLIA'S FIRST DUTY IN LIFE IS TO FLAUNT AND TO SWAGGER AND TO CARRY GORGEOUS BLOOMS WELL ABOVE ITS LEAVES
7342-73961-0011 AND ON NO ACCOUNT TO HANG ITS HEAD SOME OF THE DELICATELY COLOURED KINDS LATELY RAISED NOT ONLY HANG THEIR HEADS BUT ALSO HIDE THEM AWAY AMONG MASSES OF THEIR COARSE FOLIAGE AND ARE DOUBLY FRAUDS
7342-73961-0012 BUT AT A BUSY SEASON WHEN RANK LEAFAGE GROWS FAST
7342-73961-0013 CAREFUL AND STRONG STAKING THEY MUST ALWAYS HAVE NOT FORGETTING ONE CENTRAL STAKE TO SECURE THE MAIN GROWTH AT FIRST IT IS BEST TO DRIVE THIS INTO THE HOLE MADE FOR THE PLANT BEFORE PLACING THE ROOT
7342-73961-0014 TO AVOID THE DANGER OF SENDING THE POINT OF THE STAKE THROUGH THE TENDER TUBERS ITS HEIGHT OUT OF THE GROUND SHOULD BE ABOUT EIGHTEEN INCHES LESS THAN THE EXPECTED STATURE OF THE PLANT
7342-73961-0015 AS THE DAHLIA GROWS THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST THREE OUTER STAKES AT SUCH DISTANCE FROM THE MIDDLE ONE AS MAY SUIT THE BULK AND HABIT OF THE PLANT
7342-73961-0016 AND IT IS A GOOD PLAN TO HAVE WOODEN HOOPS TO TIE TO THESE SO AS TO FORM A GIRDLE ROUND THE WHOLE PLANT AND FOR TYING OUT THE OUTER BRANCHES THE HOOP SHOULD BE ONLY LOOSELY FASTENED
7342-73961-0017 ROUND A TUB AND TYING THEM WITH TARRED TWINE OR OSIER BANDS THEY LAST SEVERAL YEARS ALL THIS CARE IN STAKING THE DAHLIAS IS LABOUR WELL BESTOWED
7342-73961-0018 FOR WHEN AUTUMN STORMS COME THE WIND HAS SUCH A POWER OF WRENCHING AND TWISTING THAT UNLESS THE PLANT NOW GROWN INTO A HEAVY MASS OF SUCCULENT VEGETATION
7342-73961-0019 NOW IS THE MOMENT TO GET TO WORK ON THE ROCK GARDEN THERE IS NO TIME OF YEAR SO PRECIOUS FOR THIS WORK AS SEPTEMBER SMALL THINGS PLANTED NOW
7342-73961-0020 WHILE THE GROUND IS STILL WARM GROW AT THE ROOT AT ONCE AND GET BOTH ANCHOR HOLD AND FEEDING HOLD OF THE GROUND BEFORE FROST COMES THOSE THAT ARE PLANTED LATER DO NOT TAKE HOLD
7342-73961-0021 AND EVERY FROST HEAVES THEM UP SOMETIMES RIGHT OUT OF THE GROUND MEANWHILE THOSE THAT HAVE GOT A FIRM ROOT HOLD ARE GROWING STEADILY ALL THE WINTER UNDERGROUND IF NOT ABOVE
7342-73961-0022 AND WHEN THE FIRST SPRING WARMTH COMES THEY CAN DRAW UPON THE RESERVE OF STRENGTH THEY HAVE BEEN HOARDING UP AND MAKE GOOD GROWTH AT ONCE EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A ROCKERY ONLY A YEAR OLD
7342-73961-0023 THERE IS SURE TO BE SOME PART THAT WANTS TO BE WORKED AFRESH AND I FIND IT CONVENIENT TO DO ABOUT A THIRD OF THE SPACE EVERY YEAR MANY OF THE INDISPENSABLE ALPINES AND ROCK PLANTS OF LOWLY GROWTH INCREASE AT A GREAT RATE
7342-73961-0024 SOME SPREADING OVER MUCH MORE THAN THEIR DUE SPACE THE VERY REASON OF THIS QUICK SPREADING HABIT BEING THAT THEY ARE TRAVELLING TO FRESH PASTURE MANY OF THEM PROVE IT CLEARLY
7342-73961-0025 HUTCHINSIA ALPINA PTEROCEPHALUS THE DWARF ALPINE KINDS OF ACHILLEA AND ARTEMISIA VERONICA AND LINARIA AND THE MOSSY SAXIFRAGES
7342-73961-0026 IN MY SOIL WANT TRANSPLANTING EVERY TWO YEARS AND THE SILVERY SAXIFRAGES EVERY THREE YEARS AS IN MUCH ELSE ONE MUST WATCH WHAT HAPPENS IN ONE'S OWN GARDEN
7342-73961-0027 WE PRACTICAL GARDENERS HAVE NO ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE PLANT STILL LESS OF THE CHEMISTRY OF THE SOIL BUT BY THE CONSTANT EXERCISE OF WATCHFUL CARE AND HELPFUL SYMPATHY
7342-73961-0028 ONE OF THE BEST AND SIMPLEST WAYS OF GROWING ROCK PLANTS IS IN A LOOSE WALL IN MANY GARDENS AN ABRUPT CHANGE OF LEVEL MAKES A RETAINING WALL NECESSARY
7342-73961-0029 AND WHEN I SEE THIS BUILT IN THE USUAL WAY AS A SOLID STRUCTURE OF BRICK AND MORTAR UNLESS THERE BE ANY SPECIAL NEED OF THE SOLID WALL I ALWAYS REGRET THAT IT IS NOT BUILT AS A HOME FOR ROCK PLANTS
7342-73961-0030 AN EXPOSURE TO NORTH OR EAST AND THE COOL BACKING OF A MASS OF EARTH IS JUST WHAT MOST ALPINES DELIGHT IN A DRY WALL WHICH MEANS A WALL WITHOUT MORTAR
7342-73961-0031 MAY BE ANYTHING BETWEEN A WALL AND A VERY STEEP ROCK WORK AND MAY BE BUILT OF BRICK OR OF ANY KIND OF LOCAL STONE I HAVE BUILT AND PLANTED A GOOD MANY HUNDRED YARDS OF DRY WALLING WITH MY OWN HANDS
7342-73961-0032 BOTH AT HOME AND IN OTHER GARDENS AND CAN SPEAK WITH SOME CONFIDENCE BOTH OF THE PLEASURE AND INTEREST OF THE ACTUAL MAKING AND PLANTING AND OF THE SATISFACTORY RESULTS THAT FOLLOW
7342-73961-0033 THE BEST EXAMPLE I HAVE TO SHOW IN MY OWN GARDEN IS THE SO CALLED OLD WALL BEFORE MENTIONED IT IS THE BOUNDING AND PROTECTING FENCE OF THE PAEONY GROUND ON ITS NORTHERN SIDE
7342-73961-0034 THE POINT OF MOST STRUCTURAL IMPORTANCE IS TO KEEP THE EARTH SOLIDLY TRODDEN AND RAMMED BEHIND THE STONES OF EACH COURSE AND THROUGHOUT ITS BULK AND EVERY TWO OR THREE COURSES
7342-73961-0035 TO LAY SOME STONES THAT ARE EXTRA LONG FRONT AND BACK TO TIE THE WALL WELL INTO THE BANK A LOCAL SANDSTONE IS THE WALLING MATERIAL IN THE PIT IT OCCURS IN SEPARATE LAYERS
7342-73961-0036 WITH A FEW FEET OF HARD SAND BETWEEN EACH THE LOWEST LAYER SOMETIMES THIRTY TO FORTY FEET DOWN IS THE BEST AND THICKEST BUT THAT IS GOOD BUILDING STONE
7342-73961-0037 AND FOR DRY WALLING WE ONLY WANT TOPS OR SECONDS
