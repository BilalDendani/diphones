5224-35453-0000 THE ROARING ABYSMAL BEAST DURING THE LONG PERIOD OF OUR STAY IN THE REFUGE WE WERE KEPT CLOSELY IN TOUCH WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD WITHOUT AND WE WERE LEARNING THOROUGHLY THE STRENGTH OF THE OLIGARCHY WITH WHICH WE WERE AT WAR
5224-35453-0001 OUT OF THE FLUX OF TRANSITION THE NEW INSTITUTIONS WERE FORMING MORE DEFINITELY AND TAKING ON THE APPEARANCE AND ATTRIBUTES OF PERMANENCE THE OLIGARCHS HAD SUCCEEDED IN DEVISING A GOVERNMENTAL MACHINE AS INTRICATE AS IT WAS VAST THAT WORKED
5224-35453-0002 AND THIS DESPITE ALL OUR EFFORTS TO CLOG AND HAMPER THIS WAS A SURPRISE TO MANY OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS THEY HAD NOT CONCEIVED IT POSSIBLE NEVERTHELESS THE WORK OF THE COUNTRY WENT ON THE MEN TOILED IN THE MINES AND FIELDS PERFORCE THEY WERE NO MORE THAN SLAVES
5224-35453-0003 AS FOR THE VITAL INDUSTRIES EVERYTHING PROSPERED THE MEMBERS OF THE GREAT LABOR CASTES WERE CONTENTED AND WORKED ON MERRILY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES THEY KNEW INDUSTRIAL PEACE NO MORE WERE THEY WORRIED BY SLACK TIMES STRIKE AND LOCKOUT AND THE UNION LABEL
5224-35453-0004 THEY LIVED IN MORE COMFORTABLE HOMES AND IN DELIGHTFUL CITIES OF THEIR OWN DELIGHTFUL COMPARED WITH THE SLUMS AND GHETTOS IN WHICH THEY HAD FORMERLY DWELT THEY HAD BETTER FOOD TO EAT LESS HOURS OF LABOR MORE HOLIDAYS AND A GREATER AMOUNT AND VARIETY OF INTERESTS AND PLEASURES
5224-35453-0005 AND FOR THEIR LESS FORTUNATE BROTHERS AND SISTERS THE UNFAVORED LABORERS THE DRIVEN PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS THEY CARED NOTHING AN AGE OF SELFISHNESS WAS DAWNING UPON MANKIND AND YET THIS IS NOT ALTOGETHER TRUE THE LABOR CASTES WERE HONEYCOMBED BY OUR AGENTS
5224-35453-0006 MEN WHOSE EYES SAW BEYOND THE BELLY NEED THE RADIANT FIGURE OF LIBERTY AND BROTHERHOOD ANOTHER GREAT INSTITUTION THAT HAD TAKEN FORM AND WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY WAS THE MERCENARIES THIS BODY OF SOLDIERS HAD BEEN EVOLVED OUT OF THE OLD REGULAR ARMY AND WAS NOW A MILLION STRONG
5224-35453-0007 TO SAY NOTHING OF THE COLONIAL FORCES THE MERCENARIES CONSTITUTED A RACE APART THEY DWELT IN CITIES OF THEIR OWN WHICH WERE PRACTICALLY SELF GOVERNED AND THEY WERE GRANTED MANY PRIVILEGES BY THEM A LARGE PORTION OF THE PERPLEXING SURPLUS WAS CONSUMED
5224-35453-0008 THEY WERE LOSING ALL TOUCH AND SYMPATHY WITH THE REST OF THE PEOPLE AND IN FACT WERE DEVELOPING THEIR OWN CLASS MORALITY AND CONSCIOUSNESS AND YET WE HAD THOUSANDS OF OUR AGENTS AMONG THEM
5224-35453-0009 THE MERCENARIES IN THE LAST DAYS OF THE IRON HEEL PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE THEY CONSTITUTED THE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE STRUGGLES BETWEEN THE LABOR CASTES AND THE OLIGARCHS AND NOW TO ONE SIDE AND NOW TO THE OTHER THREW THEIR STRENGTH ACCORDING TO THE PLAY OF INTRIGUE AND CONSPIRACY
5224-35453-0010 AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENT AS A CLASS THEY DISCIPLINED THEMSELVES EVERY MEMBER HAD HIS WORK TO DO IN THE WORLD AND THIS WORK HE WAS COMPELLED TO DO THERE WERE NO MORE IDLE RICH YOUNG MEN THEIR STRENGTH WAS USED TO GIVE UNITED STRENGTH TO THE OLIGARCHY
5224-35453-0011 THEY FOUND CAREERS IN APPLIED SCIENCE AND MANY OF THEM BECAME GREAT ENGINEERS THEY WENT INTO THE MULTITUDINOUS DIVISIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT TOOK SERVICE IN THE COLONIAL POSSESSIONS AND BY TENS OF THOUSANDS WENT INTO THE VARIOUS SECRET SERVICES
5224-35453-0012 THEY WERE I MAY SAY APPRENTICED TO EDUCATION TO ART TO THE CHURCH TO SCIENCE TO LITERATURE
5224-35453-0013 IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PERPETUITY OF THE OLIGARCHY THEY WERE TAUGHT AND LATER THEY IN TURN TAUGHT THAT WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS RIGHT THEY ASSIMILATED THE ARISTOCRATIC IDEA FROM THE MOMENT THEY BEGAN AS CHILDREN TO RECEIVE IMPRESSIONS OF THE WORLD THE ARISTOCRATIC IDEA WAS WOVEN INTO THE MAKING OF THEM
5224-35453-0014 UNTIL IT BECAME BONE OF THEM AND FLESH OF THEM THEY LOOKED UPON THEMSELVES AS WILD ANIMAL TRAINERS RULERS OF BEASTS FROM BENEATH THEIR FEET ROSE ALWAYS THE SUBTERRANEAN RUMBLES OF REVOLT VIOLENT DEATH EVER STALKED IN THEIR MIDST
5224-35453-0015 BOMB AND KNIFE AND BULLET WERE LOOKED UPON AS SO MANY FANGS OF THE ROARING ABYSMAL BEAST THEY MUST DOMINATE IF HUMANITY WERE TO PERSIST THEY WERE THE SAVIOURS OF HUMANITY AND THEY REGARDED THEMSELVES AS HEROIC AND SACRIFICING LABORERS FOR THE HIGHEST GOOD
5224-35453-0016 THEY AS A CLASS BELIEVED THAT THEY ALONE MAINTAINED CIVILIZATION IT WAS THEIR BELIEF THAT IF EVER THEY WEAKENED THE GREAT BEAST WOULD INGULF THEM AND EVERYTHING OF BEAUTY AND WONDER AND JOY AND GOOD IN ITS CAVERNOUS AND SLIME DRIPPING MAW
5224-35453-0017 WITHOUT THEM ANARCHY WOULD REIGN AND HUMANITY WOULD DROP BACKWARD INTO THE PRIMITIVE NIGHT OUT OF WHICH IT HAD SO PAINFULLY EMERGED THE HORRID PICTURE OF ANARCHY WAS HELD ALWAYS BEFORE THEIR CHILD'S EYES UNTIL THEY IN TURN OBSESSED BY THIS CULTIVATED FEAR
5224-35453-0018 HELD THE PICTURE OF ANARCHY BEFORE THE EYES OF THE CHILDREN THAT FOLLOWED THEM THIS WAS THE BEAST TO BE STAMPED UPON AND THE HIGHEST DUTY OF THE ARISTOCRAT WAS TO STAMP UPON IT IN SHORT THEY ALONE BY THEIR UNREMITTING TOIL AND SACRIFICE STOOD BETWEEN WEAK HUMANITY
5224-35453-0019 AND THE ALL DEVOURING BEAST AND THEY BELIEVED IT FIRMLY BELIEVED IT I CANNOT LAY TOO GREAT STRESS UPON THIS HIGH ETHICAL RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE WHOLE OLIGARCH CLASS THIS HAS BEEN THE STRENGTH OF THE IRON HEEL
5224-35453-0020 AND TOO MANY OF THE COMRADES HAVE BEEN SLOW OR LOATH TO REALIZE IT MANY OF THEM HAVE ASCRIBED THE STRENGTH OF THE IRON HEEL TO ITS SYSTEM OF REWARD AND PUNISHMENT THIS IS A MISTAKE HEAVEN AND HELL MAY BE THE PRIME FACTORS OF ZEAL IN THE RELIGION OF A FANATIC
5224-35453-0021 BUT FOR THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE RELIGIOUS HEAVEN AND HELL ARE INCIDENTAL TO RIGHT AND WRONG LOVE OF THE RIGHT DESIRE FOR THE RIGHT UNHAPPINESS WITH ANYTHING LESS THAN THE RIGHT IN SHORT RIGHT CONDUCT IS THE PRIME FACTOR OF RELIGION
5224-35453-0022 AND SO WITH THE OLIGARCHY PRISONS BANISHMENT AND DEGRADATION HONORS AND PALACES AND WONDER CITIES ARE ALL INCIDENTAL THE GREAT DRIVING FORCE OF THE OLIGARCHS IS THE BELIEF THAT THEY ARE DOING RIGHT
5224-35453-0023 NEVER MIND THE EXCEPTIONS AND NEVER MIND THE OPPRESSION AND INJUSTICE IN WHICH THE IRON HEEL WAS CONCEIVED ALL IS GRANTED THE POINT IS THAT THE STRENGTH OF THE OLIGARCHY TODAY LIES IN ITS SATISFIED CONCEPTION OF ITS OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS
5224-35453-0024 OUT OF THE ETHICAL INCOHERENCY AND INCONSISTENCY OF CAPITALISM THE OLIGARCHS EMERGED WITH A NEW ETHICS COHERENT AND DEFINITE SHARP AND SEVERE AS STEEL THE MOST ABSURD AND UNSCIENTIFIC AND AT THE SAME TIME THE MOST POTENT EVER POSSESSED BY ANY TYRANT CLASS
5224-35453-0025 AND BECAUSE OF THEIR FAITH FOR THREE CENTURIES THEY WERE ABLE TO HOLD BACK THE MIGHTY TIDE OF HUMAN PROGRESS A SPECTACLE PROFOUND TREMENDOUS PUZZLING TO THE METAPHYSICAL MORALIST AND ONE THAT TO THE MATERIALIST IS THE CAUSE OF MANY DOUBTS AND RECONSIDERATIONS
5224-35453-0026 FOR THAT MATTER THE STRENGTH OF THE REVOLUTION DURING THESE FRIGHTFUL TWENTY YEARS HAS RESIDED IN NOTHING ELSE THAN THE SENSE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS IN NO OTHER WAY CAN BE EXPLAINED OUR SACRIFICES AND MARTYRDOMS
5224-35453-0027 FOR NO OTHER REASON DID RUDOLPH MENDENHALL FLAME OUT HIS SOUL FOR THE CAUSE AND SING HIS WILD SWAN SONG THAT LAST NIGHT OF LIFE FOR NO OTHER REASON DID HURLBERT DIE UNDER TORTURE REFUSING TO THE LAST TO BETRAY HIS COMRADES
5224-35453-0028 FOR NO OTHER REASON HAS ANNA ROYLSTON REFUSED BLESSED MOTHERHOOD FOR NO OTHER REASON HAS JOHN CARLSON BEEN THE FAITHFUL AND UNREWARDED CUSTODIAN OF THE GLEN ELLEN REFUGE IT DOES NOT MATTER
5224-35453-0029 YOUNG OR OLD MAN OR WOMAN HIGH OR LOW GENIUS OR CLOD GO WHERE ONE WILL AMONG THE COMRADES OF THE REVOLUTION THE MOTOR FORCE WILL BE FOUND TO BE A GREAT AND ABIDING DESIRE FOR THE RIGHT BUT I HAVE RUN AWAY FROM MY NARRATIVE
5224-35453-0030 ERNEST AND I WELL UNDERSTOOD BEFORE WE LEFT THE REFUGE HOW THE STRENGTH OF THE IRON HEEL WAS DEVELOPING THE LABOR CASTES THE MERCENARIES AND THE GREAT HORDES OF SECRET AGENTS AND POLICE OF VARIOUS SORTS WERE ALL PLEDGED TO THE OLIGARCHY
5224-35453-0031 IN THE MAIN AND IGNORING THE LOSS OF LIBERTY THEY WERE BETTER OFF THAN THEY HAD BEEN ON THE OTHER HAND THE GREAT HELPLESS MASS OF THE POPULATION THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS WAS SINKING INTO A BRUTISH APATHY OF CONTENT WITH MISERY
5224-35453-0032 WHENEVER STRONG PROLETARIANS ASSERTED THEIR STRENGTH IN THE MIDST OF THE MASS THEY WERE DRAWN AWAY FROM THE MASS BY THE OLIGARCHS AND GIVEN BETTER CONDITIONS BY BEING MADE MEMBERS OF THE LABOR CASTES OR OF THE MERCENARIES THUS DISCONTENT WAS LULLED
5224-35453-0033 AND THE PROLETARIAT ROBBED OF ITS NATURAL LEADERS THE CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS WAS PITIABLE COMMON SCHOOL EDUCATION SO FAR AS THEY WERE CONCERNED HAD CEASED THEY LIVED LIKE BEASTS IN GREAT SQUALID LABOR GHETTOS
5224-35453-0034 FESTERING IN MISERY AND DEGRADATION ALL THEIR OLD LIBERTIES WERE GONE THEY WERE LABOR SLAVES CHOICE OF WORK WAS DENIED THEM LIKEWISE WAS DENIED THEM THE RIGHT TO MOVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE OR THE RIGHT TO BEAR OR POSSESS ARMS
5224-35453-0035 THEY WERE NOT LAND SERFS LIKE THE FARMERS THEY WERE MACHINE SERFS AND LABOR SERFS WHEN UNUSUAL NEEDS AROSE FOR THEM SUCH AS THE BUILDING OF THE GREAT HIGHWAYS AND AIR LINES OF CANALS TUNNELS SUBWAYS AND FORTIFICATIONS
5224-35453-0036 LEVIES WERE MADE ON THE LABOR GHETTOS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SERFS WILLY NILLY WERE TRANSPORTED TO THE SCENE OF OPERATIONS GREAT ARMIES OF THEM ARE TOILING NOW AT THE BUILDING OF ARDIS HOUSED IN WRETCHED BARRACKS WHERE FAMILY LIFE CANNOT EXIST
5224-35453-0037 AND WHERE DECENCY IS DISPLACED BY DULL BESTIALITY IN ALL TRUTH THERE IN THE LABOR GHETTOS IS THE ROARING ABYSMAL BEAST THE OLIGARCHS FEAR SO DREADFULLY BUT IT IS THE BEAST OF THEIR OWN MAKING IN IT
5224-35453-0038 ALL THIS OF COURSE IN THE EVENT OF THE FIRST REVOLT BEING A FAILURE
5224-35453-0039 AMONG THE REVOLUTIONISTS WERE MANY SURGEONS AND IN VIVISECTION THEY ATTAINED MARVELLOUS PROFICIENCY IN AVIS EVERHARD'S WORDS THEY COULD LITERALLY MAKE A MAN OVER
5224-35453-0040 THEY CHANGED THE FEATURES WITH SUCH MICROSCOPIC CARE THAT NO TRACES WERE LEFT OF THEIR HANDIWORK THE NOSE WAS A FAVORITE ORGAN TO WORK UPON SKIN GRAFTING AND HAIR TRANSPLANTING WERE AMONG THEIR COMMONEST DEVICES THE CHANGES IN EXPRESSION THEY ACCOMPLISHED WERE WIZARD LIKE
5224-35453-0041 EYES AND EYEBROWS LIPS MOUTHS AND EARS WERE RADICALLY ALTERED BY CUNNING OPERATIONS ON TONGUE THROAT LARYNX AND NASAL CAVITIES A MAN'S WHOLE ENUNCIATION AND MANNER OF SPEECH COULD BE CHANGED DESPERATE TIMES GIVE NEED FOR DESPERATE REMEDIES AND THE SURGEONS OF THE REVOLUTION ROSE TO THE NEED
5224-35453-0042 AMONG OTHER THINGS THEY COULD INCREASE AN ADULT'S STATURE BY AS MUCH AS FOUR OR FIVE INCHES AND DECREASE IT BY ONE OR TWO INCHES WHAT THEY DID IS TO DAY A LOST ART WE HAVE NO NEED FOR IT
5224-35453-0043 IT WAS NOT UNTIL JANUARY NINETEEN SEVENTEEN THAT WE LEFT THE REFUGE ALL HAD BEEN ARRANGED
5224-35453-0044 I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ERNEST'S SISTER BY OLIGARCHS AND COMRADES ON THE INSIDE WHO WERE HIGH IN AUTHORITY PLACE HAD BEEN MADE FOR US
