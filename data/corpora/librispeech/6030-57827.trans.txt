6030-57827-0000 HAD ITS IMMEDIATE CAUSE IN A STRANGE THING GREASED CARTRIDGES
6030-57827-0001 IS ONE OF THE STRANGE TRUE STORIES OF HISTORY THERE WERE OF COURSE OTHER CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS BUT THIS WAS THE MATCH THAT TOUCHED OFF THE MAGAZINE AT THIS TIME ENGLAND EMPLOYED A GREAT MANY NATIVE TROOPS
6030-57827-0002 WHILE THE BRITISH REGULARS NUMBERED ONLY THIRTY SIX THOUSAND THE LATTER WERE OUTNUMBERED SEVEN TO ONE THE ORDNANCE DEPARTMENT ADOPTED A NEW RIFLE THE ENFIELD AT THIS JUNCTURE AND SENT A CONSIGNMENT TO INDIA
6030-57827-0003 THE CARTRIDGES FOR THE RIFLE WERE GREASED FOR EASY LOADING AND WERE TO BE BITTEN BY THE SOLDIERS
6030-57827-0004 IT WAS AGAINST THEIR RELIGIOUS SCRUPLES TO TOUCH MEAT OF ANY KIND AND THEY HEARD IT STATED THAT THE OBJECTIONABLE CARTRIDGES WERE GREASED WITH PIG'S AND COW'S FAT AS SOON AS THE COMMANDING OFFICERS SAW THE TROUBLE THEY ORDERED THAT THE CARTRIDGES BE WITHDRAWN BUT THE MISCHIEF WAS DONE
6030-57827-0005 A BASKET OF UNLEAVENED CAKES WAS BROUGHT IN AND BROKEN BY WAY OF PREARRANGED SIGNAL AFTER THE FIRST OUTBREAKS COUNCILS OF WAR WERE HURRIEDLY HELD ON THE PART OF THE BRITISH OFFICERS AND FIELD EXPEDITIONS ORGANIZED
6030-57827-0006 ONE OF THE OFFICERS COLONEL NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN WAS ASSIGNED TO THE COMMAND OF WHAT WAS CALLED THE MOVABLE COLUMN OR CHIEF ARMY OF PURSUIT ROBERTS WAS MADE ONE OF HIS STAFF OFFICERS THE MOST WONDERFUL PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE THAT COULD COME TO ME HE SAYS SHORTLY AFTERWARD
6030-57827-0007 CHAMBERLAIN WAS MADE ADJUTANT GENERAL TO THE ARMY BEFORE DELHI AND THEN CAME ORDERS FOR ALL THE ARTILLERY OFFICERS TO JOIN IN THIS ATTACK ROBERTS WAS TO SEE ACTIVE SERVICE AT LAST HE FOUND HIMSELF UNDER FIRE AT DELHI FOR THE FIRST TIME ON JUNE THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN
6030-57827-0008 WHILE IT WAS ONLY A SKIRMISH IT WAS A LIVELY ONE WHILE IT LASTED
6030-57827-0009 MAJOR COKE WENT ON AN EXPEDITION AGAINST A TROUBLESOME GROUP OF REBELS AND ROBERTS ACCOMPANIED HIM AS A STAFF OFFICER WHEN THE ENEMY APPEARED THE ONLY WAY TO REACH THEM IN TIME WAS BY CROSSING A SWAMP ANOTHER TROOP OF REBELS UNEXPECTEDLY APPEARED IN FORCE BUT WERE PUT TO ROUT
6030-57827-0010 A FEW DAYS LATER A SIMILAR SKIRMISH OCCURRED WHICH FOR A TIME LOOKED MORE SERIOUS ROBERTS WAS POSTED ACROSS A ROAD WITH A SQUAD OF MEN AND TWO GUNS THE ENEMY ATTACKED THEM WITH A CROSS FIRE HOW HE AND HIS BAND ESCAPED IS A MYSTERY
6030-57827-0011 DURING THEIR ENFORCED RETREAT ROBERTS FELT A STINGING SENSATION IN HIS BACK BUT MANAGED TO KEEP GOING IT WAS FOUND AFTERWARDS THAT HIS LIFE HAD BEEN SAVED BY THE SLIPPING OF HIS KNAPSACK DOWN FROM HIS SHOULDERS THIS HAD BEEN PENETRATED BY A BULLET WHICH HAD ENTERED HIS BODY CLOSE TO HIS SPINE
6030-57827-0012 ITS FORCE HAD BEEN BROKEN BUT THE WOUND WAS STILL SO SEVERE AS TO LAY HIM UP FOR SEVERAL WEEKS THE ALMOST SUPERHUMAN DIFFICULTIES WHICH LAY IN THE PATH OF THIS HANDFUL OF ENGLISHMEN SCATTERED THROUGHOUT INDIA ARE SUMMED UP IN A LETTER BY ANOTHER OFFICER HODSON AS FOLLOWS
6030-57827-0013 THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS A STEAMING BOG I KEEP MY HEALTH WONDERFULLY THANK GOD IN SPITE OF HEAT HARD WORK AND EXPOSURE AND THE MEN BEAR UP LIKE BRITONS
6030-57827-0014 WE ALL FEEL THAT THE GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO ALLOW EVERY OFFICER AND MAN BEFORE DELHI TO COUNT EVERY MONTH SPENT HERE AS A YEAR OF SERVICE IN INDIA THERE IS MUCH THAT IS DISAPPOINTING AND DISGUSTING TO A MAN WHO FEELS THAT MORE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE
6030-57827-0015 BUT I COMFORT MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT HISTORY WILL DO JUSTICE TO THE CONSTANCY AND FORTITUDE OF THE HANDFUL OF ENGLISHMEN WHO HAVE FOR SO MANY WEEKS MONTHS I MAY SAY OF DESPERATE WEATHER AMID THE GREATEST TOIL AND HARDSHIP
6030-57827-0016 RESISTED AND FINALLY DEFEATED THE WORST AND MOST STRENUOUS EXERTIONS OF AN ENTIRE ARMY AND A WHOLE NATION IN ARMS AN ARMY TRAINED BY OURSELVES AND SUPPLIED WITH ALL BUT EXHAUSTLESS MUNITIONS OF WAR LAID UP BY OURSELVES FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE EMPIRE
6030-57827-0017 OR HAVE AVOIDED DEFEAT HAD THEY ATTEMPTED TO DO SO THE STORY OF THE RISE AND FALL OF THE INDIAN MUTINY IS THE STORY OF THE LIFE OF ROBERTS IN SO FAR AS THE RISE IS CONCERNED HIS WAS AN INCONSPICUOUS BUT WELL PLAYED PART
6030-57827-0018 ACTING AS STAFF OFFICER AND LIEUTENANT OF A GUNNERS COMPANY BY TURNS HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE THICK OF IT IF IT WERE THE COMMAND OF GUNS AT A DIFFICULT SALIENT BEFORE DELHI IT WAS SEND ROBERTS IF IT WERE AN URGENT MESSAGE FOR MORE AMMUNITION AT AGRA SEND ROBERTS
6030-57827-0019 SEND ROBERTS THIS SLENDER UNDERSIZED OFFICER IN SPITE OF HIS PHYSIQUE SEEMED INDEFATIGABLE HE HAD SEVERAL NARROW ESCAPES FROM DEATH
6030-57827-0020 ROBERTS DREW HIS PISTOL BUT THE WEAPON MISSED FIRE
6030-57827-0021 HAD NOT A LANCER SPURRED HIS HORSE IN BETWEEN AND RUN THE FELLOW DOWN ON STILL ANOTHER OCCASION HIS PRESENCE OF MIND SAVED THE FLAG FROM CAPTURE AND BROUGHT HIM THE FIRST OF HIS MANY HONORS THE VICTORIA CROSS
6030-57827-0022 AND THE PURSUIT WAS BEING FOLLOWED UP IN BRAVE STYLE
6030-57827-0023 ROBERTS WAS OF THE PARTY AND HAD GONE TO THE RESCUE OF A MAN WHO WAS ON THE VERGE OF BEING RUN THROUGH BY A BAYONET WHEN HE SAW TWO SEPOYS RUNNING OFF WITH THE UNION JACK HE SPURRED HIS HORSE IN PURSUIT AND LEANING OVER WRENCHED THE STANDARD OUT OF THE HANDS OF ONE OF THE MEN AT THE SAME TIME SABERING HIM
6030-57827-0024 BUT THE WEAPON MISSED FIRE ROBERTS RETURNED WITH THE FLAG AND FOR REWARD OF HIS GALLANT ACTION WAS GIVEN THE V C THAT MOST COVETED OF BRITISH DECORATIONS ANOTHER OFFICER IN WRITING OF THE EVENT SAYS
6030-57827-0025 ROBERTS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE MEN WHO TO UNCOMMON DARING AND BRAVERY IN THE FIELD AND UNFLINCHING HARD WORKING DISCHARGE OF DUTY IN THE CAMP ADDS THE CHARM OF CHEERY AND UNAFFECTED KINDNESS AND HOSPITALITY IN THE TENT AND HIS ACQUAINTANCE AND FRIENDSHIP ARE HIGH PRIZES TO THOSE WHO OBTAIN THEM
6030-57827-0026 HE TURNED OVER HIS DUTIES OF DEPUTY ASSISTANT QUARTERMASTER GENERAL TO HIS SUCCESSOR THOUGH MUCH AGAINST HIS WILL HE FELT THAT AGAIN HE WAS IN DANGER OF BEING PUT UPON THE SHELF AND HIS INTENSELY ACTIVE NATURE LONGED FOR STILL FURTHER FIELD SERVICE
6030-57827-0027 IN A LITTLE OVER A YEAR HOWEVER HE WAS RECALLED TO INDIA AND THERE GIVEN A UNIQUE TASK THE FIRST VICEROY TO INDIA
6030-57827-0028 AND SHOW THE MAJESTY OF ENGLAND BY HOLDING A SERIES OF DURBARS OR TRIUMPHAL PROCESSIONS THESE EXTENDED RIGHT ACROSS INDIA FROM CITY TO CITY FOR A THOUSAND MILES TO ROBERTS WAS ASSIGNED THE IMPORTANT TASK OF ARRANGING ALL THE DETAILS OF THE TOUR AND HE DID IT WITH CHARACTERISTIC THOROUGHNESS
6030-57827-0029 IT WAS LIKE MOVING A MAMMOTH CIRCUS WHAT WITH ELEPHANTS TENTS SUPPLIES OF ALL KINDS AND GORGEOUS TRAPPINGS TO BE HANDLED THESE DURBARS LASTED FOR SIX MONTHS AND THE VICEROY NOT ONLY COMPLIMENTED ROBERTS FOR HIS WORK BUT GAZETTED HIM FOR THE RANK OF BREVET MAJOR
6030-57827-0030 THE NEXT FEW YEARS WERE MUCH OF A PIECE A ROUTINE OF OFFICE AND FIELD WORK WHICH IF IT BROUGHT NOTHING SENSATIONAL TO THE CONSCIENTIOUS YOUNG OFFICER STILL KEPT HIS FEET IN THE PATH OF GLORY IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE
6030-57827-0031 THAT HE REACHED THE GOAL FOR WHICH HE HAD LONG STRIVEN QUARTERMASTER GENERAL OF THE ARMY IN INDIA WHICH CARRIED WITH IT THE RANK OF MAJOR GENERAL WITH THIS TITLE HIS LARGER WORK IN INDIA MAY BE SAID TO HAVE FAIRLY BEGUN
