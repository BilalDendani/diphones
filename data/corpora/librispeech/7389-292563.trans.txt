7389-292563-0000 WHICH OPEN AND SHUT LIKE A SAVAGE PAIR OF PINCERS SUPPOSE WE WERE TO HEAR THAT IN A DESERT ISLAND A MONSTER LIKE THAT BUT THE SIZE OF A WOLF
7389-292563-0001 WAS JUST EMERGING FROM THE THICK JUNGLE AND MAKING FOR A TRAVELLER FOR SOME MODERN ROBINSON CRUSOE AND THAT IN ANOTHER MOMENT IT WOULD BE STICKING ITS TUSKS INTO HIM
7389-292563-0002 A TWELVE CHAMBERED REVOLVER AT LEAST TO SAY NOTHING OF A BREECH LOADING RIFLE AND EXPLOSIVE BULLETS
7389-292563-0003 PROPER GENUINE HISTORY I WILL LOSE NO TIME IN SAYING THAT THE CREATURE IS QUITE HARMLESS TO ANY OF US EVEN THE SMALLEST BY THIS I DO NOT MEAN TO SUGGEST
7389-292563-0004 THAT IT HAS NOT A VERY FIERCE AND BRUTAL TEMPER ONLY THE VICTIMS OF ITS BLOODTHIRSTY INSTINCTS MOVE IN A WORLD SO TINY THAT WE TREAD IT UNDER FOOT UNNOTICED
7389-292563-0005 IT IS AN OGRE EVER HUNGERING AFTER FRESH MEAT LIKE THE FAMOUS OGRE OF YOUR FAIRY TALES YOU KNOW THE ONE WHO WELCOMED HOP O' MY THUMB AND HIS BROTHERS TO HIS HOUSE ONE EVENING
7389-292563-0006 A GOOD RUNNER WHOSE NIMBLE LEGS PROMPTLY TAKE TO FLIGHT AND BAFFLE THE CLUMSY CORPULENT HUNTER'S ATTEMPTS TO ATTACK HER YOU MIGHT AS WELL TELL THE TORTOISE TO RUN AND CATCH THE GAZELLE
7389-292563-0007 OUR OGRE POSSESSES NO GREATER AGILITY IN COMPARISON WITH THE ANT AND MOREOVER THERE IS ANOTHER REASON THAT MAKES IT QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO RUN AFTER ANYTHING LIKE THE CRAB
7389-292563-0008 HE CAN ONLY REALLY WALK BACKWARDS WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY THE WAY TO OVERTAKE YOUR QUARRY WHEN IT'S IN FRONT OF YOU TO BE FAT AND HEAVY TO WALK BACKWARDS
7389-292563-0009 AND TO BE OBLIGED TO HAVE LIVE ANT FOR ONE'S DINNER IS A DIFFICULT A VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN SUCH A CASE COME TRY TO FIND SOMETHING
7389-292563-0010 RACK YOUR BRAINS YOU CAN THINK OF NOTHING WELL NEVER MIND PLENTY OF OTHERS INCLUDING MYSELF COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING EITHER
7389-292563-0011 EVERYDAY COMMON SENSE EXPRESSED IN PROVERBS TELLS US OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION THIS GREAT TRUTH
7389-292563-0012 WHICH WE HAVE LEARNT BY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WE SHALL LEARN ONCE MORE FROM THE ANT HUNTER BUT FIRST LET US GIVE HIM A NAME TO SIMPLIFY OUR STORY
7389-292563-0013 NATURALISTS CALL HIM THE ANT LION A VERY HAPPY TERM WHICH REMINDS US THAT LIKE THE LION HE LIVES BY CARNAGE
7389-292563-0014 SLAUGHTERING LIVE PREY IN THIS CASE ANTS NOW THAT WE HAVE CHRISTENED HIM WE CAN GO ON WHEN HE WANTS HIS DINNER THE ANT LION SAYS TO HIMSELF
7389-292563-0015 SHORT LEGGED
7389-292563-0016 PERFECT WE'LL USE THAT TALENT FOR WALKING BACKWARDS WE'LL USE THOSE TOOLS THE SHOVEL AND TONGS
7389-292563-0017 WE'LL MAKE CRAFT TAKE THE PLACE OF THE AGILITY WHICH WE LACK AND THE DINNER WILL COME ALONG NO SOONER SAID THAN DONE
7389-292563-0018 IN A NICE DRY SPOT WARMED BY THE SUN AND SHELTERED FROM THE RAIN BY AN OVERHANGING ROCK THE WILY ANIMAL SELECTS A PLACE WHERE ANTS ARE INCESSANTLY MOVING TO AND FRO ON HOUSEHOLD MATTERS
7389-292563-0019 GRAVELY WITH THE MATHEMATICAL ACCURACY OF AN ENGINEER TRACING THE FOUNDATION OF A WELL PLANNED BUILDING THE ANT LION WALKS BACKWARDS WITH HIS BODY DUG INTO THE SAND HE TURNS AND TURNS
7389-292563-0020 BUT GRADUALLY COMING NEARER THE CENTRE WHERE HE ARRIVES IN THE END IF ANY OBSTACLE SUCH AS A LARGE BIT OF GRAVEL WHICH WOULD SPOIL THE WORK MAKES ITS APPEARANCE
7389-292563-0021 ALL THESE CAVITIES ARE CONSTRUCTED ON ONE AND THE SAME PRINCIPLE THE SLOPE IS VERY STEEP AND FORMED OF EXTREMELY LOOSE SAND NOTHING HOWEVER LIGHT
7389-292563-0022 FOLLOWED BY A HEADLONG FALL WHEN THE WORK IS FINISHED THE SCOUNDREL BURIES HIMSELF IN THE SAND RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FUNNEL HIS PINCERS ALONE APPEAR OUTSIDE
7389-292563-0023 EVER READY TO SNAP BUT NEVERTHELESS HIDDEN AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND NOW THE ANT LION REMAINS COMPLETELY MOTIONLESS AND WAITS HE WAITS FOR HOURS
7389-292563-0024 FOR DAYS FOR WEEKS IF NECESSARY FOR HIS PATIENCE IS UNEQUALLED HE WAITS FOR HIS DINNER TO COME TO HIM AS HE CANNOT GO AFTER HIS DINNER HIMSELF
7389-292563-0025 BRINGING A LITTLE HONEY IN HER CROP FOR HER MATES WHO ARE WORKING AT A DISTANCE JUST AS THE GOODWIFE ON THE STROKE OF NOON BRINGS THE REAPER HIS MIDDAY MEAL IN THE FIELDS IN HER HURRY
7389-292563-0026 OR PERHAPS IN HER HEEDLESSNESS SHE HAS NOT SEEN THE PRECIPICE SHE STEPS UPON IT BUT ONLY JUST ON THE EDGE IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE AS SOON AS HER FOOT IS ON THE PERFIDIOUS SLOPE
7389-292563-0027 THE FALL ENDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SLOPE AND THE ANT RECOVERING HER BALANCE TRIES TO SCRAMBLE BACK TO THE TOP THE SAND TRICKLES UNDER HER FEET NO MATTER
7389-292563-0028 SHE GOES TO WORK WITH SO MUCH PRUDENCE SHE SO SKILFULLY MAKES USE OF THE SMALLEST SOLID SUPPORT SHE IS SO CAREFUL TO MOVE SIDEWAYS INSTEAD OF GOING STRAIGHT UP THE SLOPE
7389-292563-0029 THAT IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE CLIMB OUGHT TO BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT FRESH IMPEDIMENT HER KNEES HER DELICATE FEELERS SEEM ATREMBLE WITH EXCITEMENT ONE MORE EFFORT ONLY A LITTLE EFFORT AND THE THING IS DONE
7389-292563-0030 SUDDENLY FROM THE SKY THERE FALLS UPON THE POOR WRETCH THICK AS HAILSTONES A RAIN OF GRAINS OF SAND WHICH FOR THE TINY ANT IS AS BAD AS A REGULAR RAIN OF PEBBLES
7389-292563-0031 WHO IS THE BRUTE THAT TAKES DELIGHT IN THUS STONING THE DISTRESSED ANT WHO CLINGS IN HER DESPAIR NOW TO THIS SIDE NOW TO THAT AS BEST SHE MAY SO AS NOT TO ROLL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PRECIPICE
7389-292563-0032 THE BRUTE IS THE ANT LION THE RUFFIAN LYING IN AMBUSH DOWN IN HIS FUNNEL SEE WHAT HE IS DOING HE TAKES ON HIS FLAT HEAD A LOAD A SHOVELFUL OF SAND
7389-292563-0033 AND FLINGS IT IN THE AIR TOWARDS THE ANT WITH A SUDDEN QUICK JERK OF THE NECK LIKE THE MOVEMENT OF A SPRING THE SHOVELFULS FOLLOW RAPIDLY ONE AFTER THE OTHER WHOOSH AND WHOOSH
7389-292563-0034 THERE'S ONE YOU DON'T WANT ANOTHER THERE'S ONE ALL THE SAME WHAT CAN THE ANT DO I ASK YOU ON THE SLOPE OF THAT TERRIBLE TRAP WHERE THE GROUND FALLS FROM UNDER HER IN A RUSHING TORRENT
7389-292563-0035 WHILE A HAIL OF PEBBLES DASHES DOWN FROM ABOVE IN VAIN SHE STRUGGLES WITH ALL THE PLUCK OF DESPAIR FOR EACH STEP FORWARD SHE TAKES THREE BACK COMING NEARER AND NEARER
7389-292563-0036 TO THE DREADFUL JAWS THAT ARE WAITING FOR HER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FUNNEL BRUISED AND DAZED WITH THE STONING SHE ROLLS OVER AND OVER RIGHT INTO THE JAWS
7389-292563-0037 THE JAWS SEIZE HER AND EVERYTHING DISAPPEARS UNDER THE SAND NOT A TRACE REMAINS OF THE RECENT TRAGEDY PEACEFULLY BURIED IN THE SAND OF HIS LAIR THE ANT LION DEVOURS HIS ASTUTELY CAPTURED PREY
7389-292563-0038 WHEN THE MEAL IS OVER THERE REMAINS A DRY CARCASS WHICH MUST BE THROWN AWAY FOR IF LEFT IN THE FUNNEL IT MIGHT FRIGHTEN ANY GAME IN FUTURE AND BETRAY THE HUNTER IN HIS AMBUSH
7389-292563-0039 A JERK OF THE SHOVEL THAT IS TO SAY A TOSS OF THE FLAT HEAD FLINGS IT OUTSIDE THE HOLE THEN THE ANT LION REPAIRS THE DAMAGE DONE TO HIS TRAP REMOVES THE COARSER GRAINS OF SAND
7389-292563-0040 TOUCHES UP THE SLOPES TO MAKE THEM READY FOR A NEW SLIDE HE BURIES HIMSELF AS I HAVE DESCRIBED AND AWAITS THE COMING OF THE NEXT ANT THAT IS HOW THE ANT LION SECURES HIS DINNER
