6484-69649-0000 NO I DON'T KNOW HER YET STAY YES I THINK I HAVE SEEN HER SOMEWHERE IN PARIS POSSIBLY WILL YOU INTRODUCE ME I LEAVE THAT DUTY TO MISTER DENZIL MURRAY SAID THE DOCTOR
6484-69649-0001 FOLDING HIS ARMS NEATLY BEHIND HIS BACK HE KNOWS HER BETTER THAN I DO
6484-69649-0002 HE SETTLED HIS ACADEMIC CAP MORE FIRMLY ON HIS HEAD AND STROLLED OFF TOWARDS THE BALLROOM
6484-69649-0003 IRRESOLUTE HIS EYES FIXED ON THAT WONDROUS GOLDEN FIGURE THAT FLOATED BEFORE HIS EYES LIKE AN AERIAL VISION DENZIL MURRAY HAD GONE FORWARD TO MEET THE PRINCESS AND WAS NOW TALKING TO HER
6484-69649-0004 HIS HANDSOME FACE RADIATING WITH THE ADMIRATION HE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE
6484-69649-0005 AND CAUGHT PART OF THE CONVERSATION YOU LOOK THE VERY BEAU IDEAL OF AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS MURRAY WAS SAYING YOUR COSTUME IS PERFECT SHE LAUGHED AGAIN THAT SWEET RARE LAUGHTER
6484-69649-0006 IT BEAT IN HIS EARS AND SMOTE HIS BRAIN WITH A STRANGE ECHO OF FAMILIARITY IS IT NOT SHE RESPONDED I AM HISTORICALLY CORRECT AS YOUR FRIEND DOCTOR DEAN WOULD SAY MY ORNAMENTS ARE GENUINE
6484-69649-0007 THEY ALL CAME OUT OF THE SAME TOMB I FIND ONE FAULT WITH YOUR ATTIRE PRINCESS SAID ONE OF THE MALE ADMIRERS WHO HAD ENTERED WITH HER PART OF YOUR FACE IS VEILED THAT IS A CRUELTY TO US ALL
6484-69649-0008 SHE WAIVED THE COMPLIMENT ASIDE WITH A LIGHT GESTURE IT WAS THE FASHION IN ANCIENT EGYPT SHE SAID LOVE IN THOSE OLD DAYS WAS NOT WHAT IT IS NOW ONE GLANCE ONE SMILE
6484-69649-0009 WAS SUFFICIENT TO SET THE SOUL ON FIRE AND DRAW ANOTHER SOUL TOWARDS IT TO CONSUME TOGETHER IN THE SUDDENLY KINDLED FLAME AND WOMEN VEILED THEIR FACES IN YOUTH LEST THEY SHOULD BE DEEMED TOO PRODIGAL OF THEIR CHARMS
6484-69649-0010 AND IN AGE THEY COVERED THEMSELVES STILL MORE CLOSELY IN ORDER NOT TO AFFRONT THE SUN GOD'S FAIRNESS BY THEIR WRINKLES SHE SMILED
6484-69649-0011 YET A FEW STEPS CLOSER UNCONSCIOUSLY AS THOUGH HE WERE BEING MAGNETIZED
6484-69649-0012 SHOWING AN EXQUISITE FACE FAIR AS A LILY AND OF SUCH PERFECT LOVELINESS THAT THE MEN WHO WERE GATHERED ROUND HER SEEMED TO LOSE BREATH AND SPEECH AT SIGHT OF IT THAT PLEASES YOU BETTER MISTER MURRAY
6484-69649-0013 DENZIL GREW VERY PALE BENDING DOWN HE MURMURED SOMETHING TO HER IN A LOW TONE SHE RAISED HER LOVELY BROWS WITH A LITTLE TOUCH OF SURPRISE THAT WAS HALF DISDAIN AND LOOKED AT HIM STRAIGHTLY
6484-69649-0014 YOU SAY VERY PRETTY THINGS BUT THEY DO NOT ALWAYS PLEASE ME SHE OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT IS MY FAULT NO DOUBT AND SHE BEGAN TO MOVE ONWARDS HER NUBIAN PAGE PRECEDING HER AS BEFORE
6484-69649-0015 INTRODUCE ME HE SAID IN A COMMANDING TONE TO DENZIL DENZIL LOOKED AT HIM SOMEWHAT STARTLED BY THE SUPPRESSED PASSION IN HIS VOICE CERTAINLY PRINCESS PERMIT ME
6484-69649-0016 SHE PAUSED A FIGURE OF SILENT GRACE AND ATTENTION ALLOW ME TO PRESENT TO YOU MY FRIEND
6484-69649-0017 THE MOST FAMOUS ARTIST IN FRANCE
6484-69649-0018 THE PRINCESS ZISKA SHE RAISED HER DEEP DARK EYES AND FIXED THEM ON HIS FACE AND AS HE LOOKED BOLDLY AT HER IN A KIND OF AUDACIOUS ADMIRATION HE FELT AGAIN
6484-69649-0019 THAT STRANGE DIZZYING SHOCK WHICH HAD BEFORE THRILLED HIM THROUGH AND THROUGH THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGELY FAMILIAR ABOUT HER THE FAINT ODORS THAT SEEMED EXHALED FROM HER GARMENTS THE GLEAM OF THE JEWEL WINGED SCARABEI ON HER BREAST
6484-69649-0020 THE WEIRD LIGHT OF THE EMERALD STUDDED SERPENT IN HER HAIR AND MORE MUCH MORE FAMILIAR THAN THESE TRIFLES WAS THE SOUND OF HER VOICE DULCET PENETRATING GRAVE AND HAUNTING IN ITS TONE
6484-69649-0021 AND WITH A GRACEFUL INCLINATION OF HER HEAD BUT I CANNOT LOOK UPON YOU AS A STRANGER FOR I HAVE KNOWN YOU SO LONG IN SPIRIT SHE SMILED A STRANGE SMILE DAZZLING YET ENIGMATICAL
6484-69649-0022 AND SOMETHING WILD AND VOLUPTUOUS SEEMED TO STIR IN GERVASE'S PULSES AS HE TOUCHED THE SMALL HAND LOADED WITH QUAINT EGYPTIAN GEMS WHICH SHE GRACIOUSLY EXTENDED TOWARDS HIM
6484-69649-0023 I THINK I HAVE KNOWN YOU TOO HE SAID POSSIBLY IN A DREAM A DREAM OF BEAUTY NEVER REALIZED TILL NOW HIS VOICE SANK TO AN AMOROUS WHISPER BUT SHE SAID NOTHING IN REPLY
6484-69649-0024 NOR COULD HER LOOKS BE CONSTRUED INTO ANY EXPRESSION OF EITHER PLEASURE OR OFFENCE YET THROUGH THE HEART OF YOUNG DENZIL MURRAY WENT A SUDDEN PANG OF JEALOUSY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE
6484-69649-0025 HE BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT EVEN AMONG MEN AS WELL AS WOMEN THERE MAY EXIST WHAT IS CALLED THE PETTY ENVY OF A POSSIBLE RIVAL
6484-69649-0026 AND HE NOTED THE SYMMETRY AND SUPPLE GRACE OF THE MAN WITH AN IRRITATION OF WHICH HE WAS ASHAMED HE KNEW DESPITE HIS OWN UNDENIABLY HANDSOME PERSONALITY
6484-69649-0027 WHICH WAS SET OFF TO SUCH ADVANTAGE THAT NIGHT BY THE RICHNESS OF THE FLORENTINE COSTUME HE HAD ADOPTED
6484-69649-0028 WHICH WAS INBORN A TRICK OF MANNER WHICH MADE HIM SEEM PICTURESQUE AT ALL TIMES AND THAT EVEN WHEN THE GREAT FRENCH ARTIST HAD STAYED WITH HIM IN SCOTLAND AND GOT HIMSELF UP FOR THE OCCASION IN MORE OR LESS BAGGY TWEEDS
6484-69649-0029 PEOPLE WERE FOND OF REMARKING THAT THE ONLY MAN WHO EVER SUCCEEDED IN MAKING TWEEDS LOOK ARTISTIC
6484-69649-0030 AND IN THE WHITE BEDOUIN GARB HE NOW WORE HE WAS SEEN AT HIS BEST
6484-69649-0031 MADE HIM LOOK THE SAVAGE PART HE HAD DRESSED FOR AND AS HE BENT HIS HEAD OVER THE PRINCESS ZISKA'S HAND AND KISSED IT WITH AN ODD MINGLING OF FLIPPANCY AND REVERENCE DENZIL SUDDENLY BEGAN TO THINK
6484-69649-0032 HOW CURIOUSLY ALIKE THEY WERE THESE TWO STRONG MAN AND FAIR WOMAN BOTH HAD MANY PHYSICAL POINTS IN COMMON THE SAME DARK LEVEL BROWS THE SAME HALF WILD HALF TENDER EYES
6484-69649-0033 THE SAME SINUOUS GRACE OF FORM THE SAME PECULIAR LIGHTNESS OF MOVEMENT AND YET BOTH WERE DIFFERENT WHILE RESEMBLING EACH OTHER
6484-69649-0034 WHICH EXISTED BETWEEN THEM IT WAS THE CAST OF COUNTENANCE OR TYPE THAT EXISTS BETWEEN RACES OR TRIBES
6484-69649-0035 AND EQUALLY UNDERSTOOD THE PRINCESS ZISKA TO BE OF RUSSIAN ORIGIN HE WOULD HAVE DECLARED THEM BOTH NATIVES OF EGYPT OF THE PUREST CASTE AND HIGHEST BREEDING HE WAS SO STRUCK BY THIS IDEA THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SPOKEN HIS THOUGHT ALOUD
6484-69649-0036 AND APPARENTLY PREPARING TO WRITE NO NAME BUT HERS DOWN THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF HIS BALL PROGRAMME A PIECE OF AUDACITY WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF ROUSING DENZIL TO ASSERT HIS OWN RIGHTS YOU PROMISED ME THE FIRST WALTZ PRINCESS HE SAID
6484-69649-0037 HIS FACE FLUSHING AS HE SPOKE QUITE TRUE AND YOU SHALL HAVE IT SHE REPLIED SMILING
6484-69649-0038 THE MUSIC SOUNDS VERY INVITING SHALL WE NOT GO IN WE SPOIL THE EFFECT OF YOUR ENTREE CROWDING ABOUT YOU LIKE THIS SAID DENZIL
6484-69649-0039 NO I LAY NO CLAIM TO SOVEREIGNTY SHE ANSWERED I AM FOR TO NIGHT THE LIVING PICTURE OF A ONCE FAMOUS AND VERY IMPROPER PERSON WHO BORE HALF MY NAME A DANCER OF OLD TIME
6484-69649-0040 KNOWN AS ZISKA CHARMAZEL THE FAVORITE OF THE HAREM OF A GREAT EGYPTIAN WARRIOR DESCRIBED IN FORGOTTEN HISTORIES AS THE MIGHTY ARAXES SHE PAUSED
6484-69649-0041 HER ADMIRERS FASCINATED BY THE SOUND OF HER VOICE WERE ALL SILENT
6484-69649-0042 AND ADDRESSING HIM ONLY CONTINUED YES I AM CHARMAZEL SHE SAID SHE WAS AS I TELL YOU AN IMPROPER PERSON OR WOULD BE SO CONSIDERED BY THE GOOD ENGLISH PEOPLE
6484-69649-0043 BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHE WAS NEVER MARRIED TO ARAXES THIS EXPLANATION GIVEN WITH THE DEMUREST NAIVETE
6484-69649-0044 WAS HE A VERY DISTINGUISHED PERSONAGE HE WAS OLD LEGENDS SAY HE WAS THE GREATEST WARRIOR OF HIS TIME
6484-69649-0045 ARE THE GREATEST ARTIST
6484-69649-0046 YOU FLATTER ME FAIR CHARMAZEL HE SAID THEN SUDDENLY AS THE STRANGE NAME PASSED HIS LIPS HE RECOILED AS IF HE HAD BEEN STUNG AND SEEMED FOR A MOMENT DAZED THE PRINCESS TURNED HER DARK EYES ON HIM INQUIRINGLY
6484-69649-0047 HIS BROWS KNITTED IN A PERPLEXED FROWN NOTHING THE HEAT THE AIR A TRIFLE I ASSURE YOU WILL YOU NOT JOIN THE DANCERS DENZIL THE MUSIC CALLS YOU WHEN YOUR WALTZ WITH THE PRINCESS IS ENDED
6484-69649-0048 I SHALL CLAIM MY TURN FOR THE MOMENT AU REVOIR HE STOOD ASIDE AND LET THE LITTLE GROUP PASS HIM BY THE PRINCESS ZISKA MOVING WITH HER FLOATING NOISELESS GRACE DENZIL MURRAY BESIDE HER
6484-69649-0049 THE LITTLE NUBIAN BOY WAVING THE PEACOCK PLUMES IN FRONT OF THEM BOTH AND ALL THE OTHER ENSLAVED ADMIRERS OF THIS SINGULARLY ATTRACTIVE WOMAN CROWDING TOGETHER BEHIND HE WATCHED THE LITTLE CORTEGE WITH STRAINED
6484-69649-0050 DIM SIGHT TILL JUST AT THE DIVIDING PORTAL BETWEEN THE LOUNGE AND THE BALLROOM THE PRINCESS TURNED AND LOOKED BACK AT HIM WITH A SMILE OVER ALL THE INTERVENING HEADS THEIR EYES MET
6484-69649-0051 IN ONE FLASH OF MUTUAL COMPREHENSION THEN AS THE FAIR FACE VANISHED LIKE A LIGHT ABSORBED INTO THE LIGHTS BEYOND IT
6484-69649-0052 DROPPED HEAVILY INTO A CHAIR AND STARED VAGUELY AT THE ELABORATE PATTERN OF THE THICK CARPET AT HIS FEET PASSING HIS HAND ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD HE WITHDREW IT WET WITH DROPS OF PERSPIRATION WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME HE MUTTERED
6484-69649-0053 AM I SICKENING FOR A FEVER BEFORE I HAVE BEEN FORTY EIGHT HOURS IN CAIRO WHAT FOOL'S NOTION IS THIS IN MY BRAIN WHERE HAVE I SEEN HER BEFORE IN PARIS SAINT PETERSBURG LONDON CHARMAZEL CHARMAZEL

6484-69649-0056 I KNOW THE VERY PERFUME OF HER HAIR IT SEEMS TO CREEP INTO MY BLOOD IT INTOXICATES ME IT CHOKES ME HE SPRANG UP WITH A FIERCE GESTURE THEN AFTER A MINUTE'S PAUSE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND AGAIN STARED AT THE FLOOR
