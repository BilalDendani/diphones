505-125274-0008 SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUCH EXTRAORDINARY NOTIONS OF HUMOR IT WAS NEARLY HALF PAST TEN BEFORE I HAD RECEIVED MY MESSAGE BUT A TAXICAB TOOK ME ROUND IN GOOD TIME FOR MY APPOINTMENT
505-125274-0009 IT WAS AN IMPOSING PORTICOED HOUSE AT WHICH WE STOPPED AND THE HEAVILY CURTAINED WINDOWS GAVE EVERY INDICATION OF WEALTH UPON THE PART OF THIS FORMIDABLE PROFESSOR THE DOOR WAS OPENED BY AN ODD SWARTHY DRIED UP PERSON OF UNCERTAIN AGE
505-125274-0010 WITH A DARK PILOT JACKET AND BROWN LEATHER GAITERS I FOUND AFTERWARDS THAT HE WAS THE CHAUFFEUR WHO FILLED THE GAPS LEFT BY A SUCCESSION OF FUGITIVE BUTLERS HE LOOKED ME UP AND DOWN WITH A SEARCHING LIGHT BLUE EYE EXPECTED
505-125274-0011 HE ASKED AN APPOINTMENT GOT YOUR LETTER I PRODUCED THE ENVELOPE RIGHT HE SEEMED TO BE A PERSON OF FEW WORDS FOLLOWING HIM DOWN THE PASSAGE I WAS SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED BY A SMALL WOMAN
505-125274-0012 WHO STEPPED OUT FROM WHAT PROVED TO BE THE DINING ROOM DOOR SHE WAS A BRIGHT VIVACIOUS DARK EYED LADY MORE FRENCH THAN ENGLISH IN HER TYPE ONE MOMENT SHE SAID YOU CAN WAIT AUSTIN STEP IN HERE SIR MAY I ASK IF YOU HAVE MET MY HUSBAND BEFORE
