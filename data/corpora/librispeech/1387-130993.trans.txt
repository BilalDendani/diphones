1387-130993-0000 FROM THE NEW YORK PACKET TUESDAY DECEMBER ELEVENTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN MADISON WITH HAMILTON TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK THE UNITED NETHERLANDS ARE A CONFEDERACY OF REPUBLICS OR RATHER OF ARISTOCRACIES
1387-130993-0001 OF A VERY REMARKABLE TEXTURE YET CONFIRMING ALL THE LESSONS DERIVED FROM THOSE WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY REVIEWED THE UNION IS COMPOSED OF SEVEN COEQUAL AND SOVEREIGN STATES AND EACH STATE OR PROVINCE IS A COMPOSITION OF EQUAL AND INDEPENDENT CITIES
1387-130993-0002 IN ALL IMPORTANT CASES NOT ONLY THE PROVINCES BUT THE CITIES MUST BE UNANIMOUS THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE UNION IS REPRESENTED BY THE STATES GENERAL CONSISTING USUALLY OF ABOUT FIFTY DEPUTIES APPOINTED BY THE PROVINCES

1387-130993-0004 TO MAKE WAR AND PEACE TO RAISE ARMIES AND EQUIP FLEETS TO ASCERTAIN QUOTAS AND DEMAND CONTRIBUTIONS IN ALL THESE CASES HOWEVER UNANIMITY AND THE SANCTION OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS ARE REQUISITE
1387-130993-0005 THEY HAVE AUTHORITY TO APPOINT AND RECEIVE AMBASSADORS TO EXECUTE TREATIES AND ALLIANCES ALREADY FORMED TO PROVIDE FOR THE COLLECTION OF DUTIES ON IMPORTS AND EXPORTS TO REGULATE THE MINT WITH A SAVING TO THE PROVINCIAL RIGHTS
1387-130993-0006 TO GOVERN AS SOVEREIGNS THE DEPENDENT TERRITORIES THE PROVINCES ARE RESTRAINED UNLESS WITH THE GENERAL CONSENT FROM ENTERING INTO FOREIGN TREATIES FROM ESTABLISHING IMPOSTS INJURIOUS TO OTHERS
1387-130993-0007 OR CHARGING THEIR NEIGHBORS WITH HIGHER DUTIES THAN THEIR OWN SUBJECTS A COUNCIL OF STATE A CHAMBER OF ACCOUNTS WITH FIVE COLLEGES OF ADMIRALTY AID AND FORTIFY THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION
1387-130993-0008 WHO IS NOW AN HEREDITARY PRINCE
1387-130993-0009 FROM HIS GREAT PATRIMONIAL ESTATES FROM HIS FAMILY CONNECTIONS WITH SOME OF THE CHIEF POTENTATES OF EUROPE AND MORE THAN ALL PERHAPS FROM HIS BEING STADTHOLDER IN THE SEVERAL PROVINCES AS WELL AS FOR THE UNION
1387-130993-0010 IN WHICH PROVINCIAL QUALITY HE HAS THE APPOINTMENT OF TOWN MAGISTRATES UNDER CERTAIN REGULATIONS EXECUTES PROVINCIAL DECREES PRESIDES WHEN HE PLEASES IN THE PROVINCIAL TRIBUNALS AND HAS THROUGHOUT THE POWER OF PARDON
1387-130993-0011 IN HIS POLITICAL CAPACITY HE HAS AUTHORITY TO SETTLE DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PROVINCES WHEN OTHER METHODS FAIL TO ASSIST AT THE DELIBERATIONS OF THE STATES GENERAL AND AT THEIR PARTICULAR CONFERENCES TO GIVE AUDIENCES TO FOREIGN AMBASSADORS
1387-130993-0012 AND TO KEEP AGENTS FOR HIS PARTICULAR AFFAIRS AT FOREIGN COURTS IN HIS MILITARY CAPACITY HE COMMANDS THE FEDERAL TROOPS PROVIDES FOR GARRISONS AND IN GENERAL REGULATES MILITARY AFFAIRS DISPOSES OF ALL APPOINTMENTS FROM COLONELS TO ENSIGNS

1387-130993-0014 THE STANDING ARMY WHICH HE COMMANDS CONSISTS OF ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND MEN SUCH IS THE NATURE OF THE CELEBRATED BELGIC CONFEDERACY AS DELINEATED ON PARCHMENT WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERS WHICH PRACTICE HAS STAMPED UPON IT
1387-130993-0015 IMBECILITY IN THE GOVERNMENT DISCORD AMONG THE PROVINCES FOREIGN INFLUENCE AND INDIGNITIES A PRECARIOUS EXISTENCE IN PEACE AND PECULIAR CALAMITIES FROM WAR
1387-130993-0016 IT WAS LONG AGO REMARKED BY GROTIUS THAT NOTHING BUT THE HATRED OF HIS COUNTRYMEN TO THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA KEPT THEM FROM BEING RUINED BY THE VICES OF THEIR CONSTITUTION THE UNION OF UTRECHT SAYS ANOTHER RESPECTABLE WRITER
1387-130993-0017 REPOSES AN AUTHORITY IN THE STATES GENERAL SEEMINGLY SUFFICIENT TO SECURE HARMONY BUT THE JEALOUSY IN EACH PROVINCE RENDERS THE PRACTICE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE THEORY
1387-130993-0018 IN MATTERS OF CONTRIBUTION IT IS THE PRACTICE TO WAIVE THE ARTICLES OF THE CONSTITUTION THE DANGER OF DELAY OBLIGES THE CONSENTING PROVINCES TO FURNISH THEIR QUOTAS WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE OTHERS
1387-130993-0019 OR OTHERWISE AS THEY CAN THE GREAT WEALTH AND INFLUENCE OF THE PROVINCE OF HOLLAND ENABLE HER TO EFFECT BOTH THESE PURPOSES IT HAS MORE THAN ONCE HAPPENED THAT THE DEFICIENCIES HAD TO BE ULTIMATELY COLLECTED AT THE POINT OF THE BAYONET
1387-130993-0020 A THING PRACTICABLE THOUGH DREADFUL IN A CONFEDERACY WHERE ONE OF THE MEMBERS EXCEEDS IN FORCE ALL THE REST AND WHERE SEVERAL OF THEM ARE TOO SMALL TO MEDITATE RESISTANCE BUT UTTERLY IMPRACTICABLE IN ONE COMPOSED OF MEMBERS SEVERAL OF WHICH ARE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER IN STRENGTH AND RESOURCES
1387-130993-0021 AND EQUAL SINGLY TO A VIGOROUS AND PERSEVERING DEFENSE FOREIGN MINISTERS SAYS SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE WHO WAS HIMSELF A FOREIGN MINISTER ELUDE MATTERS TAKEN AD REFERENDUM BY TAMPERING WITH THE PROVINCES AND CITIES
1387-130993-0022 IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THEY CONCLUDED A TREATY OF THEMSELVES AT THE RISK OF THEIR HEADS THE TREATY OF WESTPHALIA IN SIXTEEN FORTY EIGHT BY WHICH THEIR INDEPENDENCE WAS FORMERLY AND FINALLY RECOGNIZED WAS CONCLUDED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ZEALAND
1387-130993-0023 EVEN AS RECENTLY AS THE LAST TREATY OF PEACE WITH GREAT BRITAIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF UNANIMITY WAS DEPARTED FROM A WEAK CONSTITUTION MUST NECESSARILY TERMINATE IN DISSOLUTION FOR WANT OF PROPER POWERS
1387-130993-0024 THAN OUT OF THE FULL EXERCISE OF THE LARGEST CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITIES NOTWITHSTANDING THE CALAMITIES PRODUCED BY THE STADTHOLDERSHIP
1387-130993-0025 SAYS THE ABBE MABLY THE UNION COULD NEVER HAVE SUBSISTED IF THE PROVINCES HAD NOT A SPRING WITHIN THEMSELVES CAPABLE OF QUICKENING THEIR TARDINESS AND COMPELLING THEM TO THE SAME WAY OF THINKING THIS SPRING IS THE STADTHOLDER
1387-130993-0026 IT IS REMARKED BY
1387-130993-0027 THAT IN THE INTERMISSIONS OF THE STADTHOLDERSHIP HOLLAND BY HER RICHES AND HER AUTHORITY WHICH DREW THE OTHERS INTO A SORT OF DEPENDENCE SUPPLIED THE PLACE
1387-130993-0028 THESE ARE NOT THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HAVE CONTROLLED THE TENDENCY TO ANARCHY AND DISSOLUTION THE SURROUNDING POWERS IMPOSE AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF UNION TO A CERTAIN DEGREE
1387-130993-0029 AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY NOURISH BY THEIR INTRIGUES THE CONSTITUTIONAL VICES WHICH KEEP THE REPUBLIC IN SOME DEGREE ALWAYS AT THEIR MERCY THE TRUE PATRIOTS HAVE LONG BEWAILED THE FATAL TENDENCY OF THESE VICES
1387-130993-0030 AND HAVE MADE NO LESS THAN FOUR REGULAR EXPERIMENTS BY EXTRAORDINARY ASSEMBLIES CONVENED FOR THE SPECIAL PURPOSE
1387-130993-0031 AS MANY TIMES HAS THEIR LAUDABLE ZEAL FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO UNITE THE PUBLIC COUNCILS IN REFORMING THE KNOWN THE ACKNOWLEDGED THE FATAL EVILS OF THE EXISTING CONSTITUTION
1387-130993-0032 LET US PAUSE MY FELLOW CITIZENS FOR ONE MOMENT OVER THIS MELANCHOLY AND MONITORY LESSON OF HISTORY
1387-130993-0033 AND WITH THE TEAR THAT DROPS FOR THE CALAMITIES BROUGHT ON MANKIND BY THEIR ADVERSE OPINIONS AND SELFISH PASSIONS LET OUR GRATITUDE MINGLE AN EJACULATION TO HEAVEN
1387-130993-0034 FOR THE PROPITIOUS CONCORD WHICH HAS DISTINGUISHED THE CONSULTATIONS FOR OUR POLITICAL HAPPINESS A DESIGN WAS ALSO CONCEIVED OF ESTABLISHING A GENERAL TAX TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL AUTHORITY
1387-130993-0035 THIS ALSO HAD ITS ADVERSARIES AND FAILED THIS UNHAPPY PEOPLE SEEM TO BE NOW SUFFERING FROM POPULAR CONVULSIONS FROM DISSENSIONS AMONG THE STATES AND FROM THE ACTUAL INVASION OF FOREIGN ARMS
1387-130993-0036 THE CRISIS OF THEIR DESTINY ALL NATIONS HAVE THEIR EYES FIXED ON THE AWFUL SPECTACLE THE FIRST WISH PROMPTED BY HUMANITY IS THAT THIS SEVERE TRIAL MAY ISSUE IN SUCH A REVOLUTION OF THEIR GOVERNMENT AS WILL ESTABLISH THEIR UNION
1387-130993-0037 I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR HAVING DWELT SO LONG ON THE CONTEMPLATION OF THESE FEDERAL PRECEDENTS EXPERIENCE IS THE ORACLE OF TRUTH AND WHERE ITS RESPONSES ARE UNEQUIVOCAL
1387-130993-0038 AS CONTRADISTINGUISHED FROM INDIVIDUALS AS IT IS A SOLECISM IN THEORY SO IN PRACTICE IT IS SUBVERSIVE OF THE ORDER AND ENDS OF CIVIL POLITY BY SUBSTITUTING VIOLENCE IN PLACE OF LAW
1387-130993-0039 OR THE DESTRUCTIVE COERCION OF THE SWORD IN PLACE OF THE MILD AND SALUTARY COERCION
