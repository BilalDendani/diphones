1566-133291-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN PRINCIPAL CAUSES MAINTAINING THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC PART TWO INFLUENCE OF THE LAWS UPON THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES
1566-133291-0001 THREE PRINCIPAL CAUSES OF THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS JUDICIAL POWER
1566-133291-0002 THE PRINCIPAL AIM OF THIS BOOK HAS BEEN TO MAKE KNOWN THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES IF THIS PURPOSE HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THE READER IS ALREADY ENABLED TO JUDGE FOR HIMSELF WHICH ARE THE LAWS THAT REALLY TEND TO MAINTAIN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
1566-133291-0003 AND WHICH ENDANGER ITS EXISTENCE IF I HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN EXPLAINING THIS IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF MY WORK I CANNOT HOPE TO DO SO WITHIN THE LIMITS OF A SINGLE CHAPTER IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO RETRACE THE PATH I HAVE ALREADY PURSUED
1566-133291-0004 WHAT I HAVE PREVIOUSLY EXPLAINED THREE CIRCUMSTANCES SEEM TO ME TO CONTRIBUTE MOST POWERFULLY TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES THE FIRST IS THAT FEDERAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH THE AMERICANS HAVE ADOPTED
1566-133291-0005 AND WHICH ENABLES THE UNION TO COMBINE THE POWER OF A GREAT EMPIRE WITH THE SECURITY OF A SMALL STATE THE SECOND CONSISTS IN THOSE MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS WHICH LIMIT THE DESPOTISM OF THE MAJORITY
1566-133291-0006 AND AT THE SAME TIME IMPART A TASTE FOR FREEDOM AND A KNOWLEDGE OF THE ART OF BEING FREE TO THE PEOPLE THE THIRD IS TO BE MET WITH IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE JUDICIAL POWER
1566-133291-0007 I HAVE SHOWN IN WHAT MANNER THE COURTS OF JUSTICE SERVE TO REPRESS THE EXCESSES OF DEMOCRACY AND HOW THEY CHECK AND DIRECT THE IMPULSES OF THE MAJORITY WITHOUT STOPPING ITS ACTIVITY
1566-133291-0008 INFLUENCE OF MANNERS UPON THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES I HAVE PREVIOUSLY REMARKED THAT THE MANNERS OF THE PEOPLE MAY BE CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE GENERAL
1566-133291-0009 CAUSES TO WHICH THE MAINTENANCE OF A DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES IS ATTRIBUTABLE I HERE USED THE WORD MANNERS WITH THE MEANING WHICH THE ANCIENTS ATTACHED TO THE WORD MORES
1566-133291-0010 FOR I APPLY IT NOT ONLY TO MANNERS IN THEIR PROPER SENSE OF WHAT CONSTITUTES THE CHARACTER OF SOCIAL INTERCOURSE BUT I EXTEND IT TO THE VARIOUS NOTIONS AND OPINIONS CURRENT AMONG MEN AND TO THE MASS OF THOSE IDEAS WHICH CONSTITUTE THEIR CHARACTER OF MIND
1566-133291-0011 I COMPRISE THEREFORE UNDER THIS TERM THE WHOLE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL CONDITION OF A PEOPLE MY INTENTION IS NOT TO DRAW A PICTURE OF AMERICAN MANNERS BUT SIMPLY TO POINT OUT SUCH FEATURES OF THEM
1566-133291-0012 RELIGION CONSIDERED AS A POLITICAL INSTITUTION WHICH POWERFULLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC AMONGST THE AMERICANS NORTH AMERICA PEOPLED BY MEN WHO PROFESSED A DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN CHRISTIANITY
1566-133291-0013 ARRIVAL OF THE CATHOLICS FOR WHAT REASON THE CATHOLICS FORM THE MOST DEMOCRATIC AND THE MOST REPUBLICAN CLASS AT THE PRESENT TIME EVERY RELIGION IS TO BE FOUND IN JUXTAPOSITION TO A
1566-133291-0014 POLITICAL OPINION WHICH IS CONNECTED WITH IT BY AFFINITY IF THE HUMAN MIND BE LEFT TO FOLLOW ITS OWN BENT IT WILL REGULATE THE TEMPORAL AND SPIRITUAL INSTITUTIONS OF SOCIETY UPON ONE UNIFORM PRINCIPLE AND MAN WILL ENDEAVOR IF I MAY USE THE EXPRESSION
1566-133291-0015 TO HARMONIZE THE STATE IN WHICH HE LIVES UPON EARTH WITH THE STATE WHICH HE BELIEVES TO AWAIT HIM IN HEAVEN THE GREATEST PART OF BRITISH AMERICA WAS PEOPLED BY MEN WHO AFTER HAVING SHAKEN OFF THE AUTHORITY OF THE POPE ACKNOWLEDGED NO OTHER RELIGIOUS SUPREMACY
1566-133291-0016 THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM INTO THE NEW WORLD A FORM OF CHRISTIANITY WHICH I CANNOT BETTER DESCRIBE THAN BY STYLING IT A DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN RELIGION THIS SECT CONTRIBUTED POWERFULLY TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A DEMOCRACY AND A REPUBLIC
1566-133291-0017 AND FROM THE EARLIEST SETTLEMENT OF THE EMIGRANTS POLITICS AND RELIGION CONTRACTED AN ALLIANCE WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN DISSOLVED ABOUT FIFTY YEARS AGO IRELAND BEGAN TO POUR A CATHOLIC POPULATION INTO THE UNITED STATES
1566-133291-0018 THEY ARE FERVENT AND ZEALOUS IN THE SUPPORT AND BELIEF OF THEIR DOCTRINES NEVERTHELESS THEY CONSTITUTE THE MOST REPUBLICAN AND THE MOST DEMOCRATIC CLASS OF CITIZENS
1566-133291-0019 THE PRIEST AND THE PEOPLE THE PRIEST ALONE RISES ABOVE THE RANK OF HIS FLOCK AND ALL BELOW HIM ARE EQUAL ON DOCTRINAL POINTS THE CATHOLIC FAITH PLACES ALL HUMAN CAPACITIES UPON THE SAME LEVEL
1566-133291-0020 IT SUBJECTS THE WISE AND IGNORANT THE MAN OF GENIUS AND THE VULGAR CROWD TO THE DETAILS OF THE SAME CREED IT IMPOSES THE SAME OBSERVANCES UPON THE RICH AND NEEDY IT INFLICTS THE SAME AUSTERITIES UPON THE STRONG AND THE WEAK
1566-133291-0021 IT LISTENS TO NO COMPROMISE WITH MORTAL MAN BUT REDUCING ALL THE HUMAN RACE TO THE SAME STANDARD IT CONFOUNDS ALL THE DISTINCTIONS OF SOCIETY AT THE FOOT OF THE SAME ALTAR EVEN AS THEY ARE CONFOUNDED IN THE SIGHT OF GOD
1566-133291-0022 IF CATHOLICISM PREDISPOSES THE FAITHFUL TO OBEDIENCE IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT PREPARE THEM FOR INEQUALITY BUT THE CONTRARY MAY BE SAID OF PROTESTANTISM WHICH GENERALLY TENDS TO MAKE MEN INDEPENDENT MORE THAN TO RENDER THEM EQUAL
1566-133291-0023 CATHOLICISM IS LIKE AN ABSOLUTE MONARCHY IF THE SOVEREIGN BE REMOVED ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF SOCIETY ARE MORE EQUAL THAN THEY ARE IN REPUBLICS
1566-133291-0024 IT HAS NOT UNFREQUENTLY OCCURRED THAT THE CATHOLIC PRIEST HAS LEFT THE SERVICE OF THE ALTAR TO MIX WITH THE GOVERNING POWERS OF SOCIETY AND TO TAKE HIS PLACE AMONGST THE CIVIL GRADATIONS OF MEN
1566-133291-0025 THIS RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE HAS SOMETIMES BEEN USED TO SECURE THE INTERESTS OF THAT POLITICAL STATE OF THINGS TO WHICH HE BELONGED AT OTHER TIMES CATHOLICS HAVE TAKEN THE SIDE OF ARISTOCRACY FROM A SPIRIT OF RELIGION
1566-133291-0026 BUT NO SOONER IS THE PRIESTHOOD ENTIRELY SEPARATED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AS IS THE CASE IN THE UNITED STATES
1566-133291-0027 IF THEN THE CATHOLIC CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES ARE NOT FORCIBLY LED BY THE NATURE OF THEIR TENETS TO ADOPT DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES AT LEAST THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY OPPOSED TO THEM
1566-133291-0028 OBLIGES THEM TO ADOPT THESE OPINIONS MOST OF THE CATHOLICS ARE POOR AND THEY HAVE NO CHANCE OF TAKING A PART IN THE GOVERNMENT UNLESS IT BE OPEN TO ALL THE CITIZENS THEY CONSTITUTE A MINORITY
1566-133291-0029 THESE TWO CAUSES INDUCE THEM UNCONSCIOUSLY TO ADOPT POLITICAL DOCTRINES WHICH THEY WOULD PERHAPS SUPPORT WITH LESS ZEAL IF THEY WERE RICH AND PREPONDERANT
1566-133291-0030 BUT IT SEEKS RATHER TO JUSTIFY ITS RESULTS THE PRIESTS IN AMERICA HAVE DIVIDED THE INTELLECTUAL WORLD INTO TWO PARTS IN THE ONE THEY PLACE THE DOCTRINES OF REVEALED RELIGION WHICH COMMAND THEIR ASSENT
1566-133291-0031 IN THE OTHER THEY LEAVE THOSE TRUTHS WHICH THEY BELIEVE TO HAVE BEEN FREELY LEFT OPEN TO THE RESEARCHES OF POLITICAL INQUIRY
1566-133291-0032 ARE AT THE SAME TIME THE MOST FAITHFUL BELIEVERS AND THE MOST ZEALOUS CITIZENS IT MAY BE ASSERTED THAT IN THE UNITED STATES NO RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE DISPLAYS THE SLIGHTEST HOSTILITY TO DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN INSTITUTIONS
1566-133291-0033 THE CLERGY OF ALL THE DIFFERENT SECTS HOLD THE SAME LANGUAGE
1566-133291-0034 AND THE HUMAN INTELLECT FLOWS ONWARDS IN ONE SOLE CURRENT I HAPPENED TO BE STAYING IN ONE OF THE LARGEST TOWNS IN THE UNION WHEN I WAS INVITED TO ATTEND A PUBLIC MEETING WHICH HAD BEEN CALLED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSISTING THE POLES AND OF SENDING THEM SUPPLIES OF ARMS AND MONEY
1566-133291-0035 I FOUND TWO OR THREE THOUSAND PERSONS COLLECTED IN A VAST HALL WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED TO RECEIVE THEM IN A SHORT TIME A PRIEST IN HIS ECCLESIASTICAL ROBES ADVANCED TO THE FRONT OF THE HUSTINGS THE SPECTATORS ROSE AND STOOD UNCOVERED
1566-133291-0036 WHILST HE SPOKE IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS ALMIGHTY GOD THE GOD OF ARMIES THOU WHO DIDST STRENGTHEN THE HEARTS AND GUIDE THE ARMS OF OUR FATHERS WHEN THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR THE SACRED RIGHTS OF NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE
1566-133291-0037 THOU WHO DIDST MAKE THEM TRIUMPH OVER A HATEFUL OPPRESSION AND HAST GRANTED TO OUR PEOPLE THE BENEFITS OF LIBERTY AND PEACE TURN O LORD A FAVORABLE EYE UPON THE OTHER HEMISPHERE
1566-133291-0038 PITIFULLY LOOK DOWN UPON THAT HEROIC NATION WHICH IS EVEN NOW STRUGGLING AS WE DID IN THE FORMER TIME AND FOR THE SAME RIGHTS WHICH WE DEFENDED WITH OUR BLOOD THOU WHO DIDST CREATE MAN IN THE LIKENESS OF THE SAME IMAGE
1566-133291-0039 LET NOT TYRANNY MAR THY WORK AND ESTABLISH INEQUALITY UPON THE EARTH ALMIGHTY GOD DO THOU WATCH OVER THE DESTINY OF THE POLES AND RENDER THEM WORTHY TO BE FREE MAY THY WISDOM DIRECT THEIR COUNCILS
1566-133291-0040 AND MAY THY STRENGTH SUSTAIN THEIR ARMS SHED FORTH THY TERROR OVER THEIR ENEMIES SCATTER THE POWERS WHICH TAKE COUNSEL AGAINST THEM AND VOUCHSAFE THAT THE INJUSTICE WHICH THE WORLD HAS WITNESSED FOR FIFTY YEARS
1566-133291-0041 BE NOT CONSUMMATED IN OUR TIME O LORD WHO HOLDEST ALIKE THE HEARTS OF NATIONS AND OF MEN IN THY POWERFUL HAND RAISE UP ALLIES TO THE SACRED CAUSE OF RIGHT AROUSE THE FRENCH NATION FROM THE APATHY IN WHICH ITS RULERS RETAIN IT
1566-133291-0042 THAT IT GO FORTH AGAIN TO FIGHT FOR THE LIBERTIES OF THE WORLD LORD TURN NOT THOU THY FACE FROM US AND GRANT THAT WE MAY ALWAYS BE THE MOST RELIGIOUS
1566-133291-0043 ALMIGHTY GOD HEAR OUR SUPPLICATIONS THIS DAY SAVE THE POLES WE BESEECH THEE IN THE NAME OF THY WELL BELOVED SON OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST WHO DIED UPON THE CROSS FOR THE SALVATION OF MEN
1566-133291-0044 AMEN THE WHOLE MEETING RESPONDED AMEN WITH DEVOTION INDIRECT INFLUENCE OF RELIGIOUS OPINIONS UPON POLITICAL SOCIETY IN THE UNITED STATES
1566-133291-0045 CHRISTIAN MORALITY COMMON TO ALL SECTS INFLUENCE OF RELIGION UPON THE MANNERS OF THE AMERICANS RESPECT FOR THE MARRIAGE TIE
1566-133291-0046 OPINION OF THE AMERICANS ON THE POLITICAL UTILITY OF RELIGION THEIR EXERTIONS TO EXTEND AND SECURE ITS PREDOMINANCE
1566-133291-0047 I HAVE JUST SHOWN WHAT THE DIRECT INFLUENCE OF RELIGION UPON POLITICS IS IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ITS INDIRECT INFLUENCE APPEARS TO ME TO BE STILL MORE CONSIDERABLE AND IT NEVER INSTRUCTS THE AMERICANS MORE FULLY IN THE ART OF BEING FREE
1566-133291-0048 THAN WHEN IT SAYS NOTHING OF FREEDOM
1566-133291-0049 THEY ALL DIFFER IN RESPECT TO THE WORSHIP WHICH IS DUE FROM MAN TO HIS CREATOR BUT THEY ALL AGREE IN RESPECT TO THE DUTIES WHICH ARE DUE FROM MAN TO MAN EACH SECT ADORES THE DEITY IN ITS OWN PECULIAR MANNER
1566-133291-0050 BUT ALL THE SECTS PREACH THE SAME MORAL LAW IN THE NAME OF GOD IF IT BE OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE TO MAN AS AN INDIVIDUAL THAT HIS RELIGION SHOULD BE TRUE THE CASE OF SOCIETY IS NOT THE SAME
1566-133291-0051 SOCIETY HAS NO FUTURE LIFE TO HOPE FOR OR TO FEAR AND PROVIDED THE CITIZENS PROFESS A RELIGION THE PECULIAR TENETS OF THAT RELIGION ARE OF VERY LITTLE IMPORTANCE TO ITS INTERESTS MOREOVER
1566-133291-0052 ALMOST ALL THE SECTS OF THE UNITED STATES ARE COMPRISED WITHIN THE GREAT UNITY OF CHRISTIANITY AND CHRISTIAN MORALITY IS EVERYWHERE THE SAME IT MAY BE BELIEVED WITHOUT UNFAIRNESS THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF AMERICANS PURSUE A PECULIAR FORM OF WORSHIP
1566-133291-0053 FROM HABIT MORE THAN FROM CONVICTION IN THE UNITED STATES THE SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY IS RELIGIOUS AND CONSEQUENTLY HYPOCRISY MUST BE COMMON BUT THERE IS NO COUNTRY IN THE WHOLE WORLD IN WHICH THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION
1566-133291-0054 RETAINS A GREATER INFLUENCE OVER THE SOULS OF MEN THAN IN AMERICA AND THERE CAN BE NO GREATER PROOF OF ITS UTILITY AND OF ITS CONFORMITY TO HUMAN NATURE THAN THAT ITS INFLUENCE IS MOST POWERFULLY FELT OVER THE MOST ENLIGHTENED
1566-133291-0055 AND FREE NATION OF THE EARTH I HAVE REMARKED THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN CLERGY IN GENERAL WITHOUT EVEN EXCEPTING THOSE WHO DO NOT ADMIT RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ARE ALL IN FAVOR OF CIVIL FREEDOM BUT THEY DO NOT SUPPORT ANY PARTICULAR POLITICAL SYSTEM
1566-133291-0056 THEY KEEP ALOOF FROM PARTIES AND FROM PUBLIC AFFAIRS IN THE UNITED STATES RELIGION EXERCISES BUT LITTLE INFLUENCE UPON THE LAWS AND UPON THE DETAILS OF PUBLIC OPINION BUT IT DIRECTS THE MANNERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND BY REGULATING DOMESTIC LIFE
1566-133291-0057 IT REGULATES THE STATE I DO NOT QUESTION THAT THE GREAT AUSTERITY OF MANNERS WHICH IS OBSERVABLE IN THE UNITED STATES ARISES IN THE FIRST INSTANCE FROM RELIGIOUS FAITH
1566-133291-0058 RELIGION IS OFTEN UNABLE TO RESTRAIN MAN FROM THE NUMBERLESS TEMPTATIONS OF FORTUNE NOR CAN IT CHECK THAT PASSION FOR GAIN WHICH EVERY INCIDENT OF HIS LIFE CONTRIBUTES TO AROUSE BUT ITS INFLUENCE OVER THE MIND OF WOMAN IS SUPREME
1566-133291-0059 AND WOMEN ARE THE PROTECTORS OF MORALS
1566-133291-0060 OR WHERE CONJUGAL HAPPINESS IS MORE HIGHLY OR WORTHILY APPRECIATED IN EUROPE ALMOST ALL THE DISTURBANCES OF SOCIETY ARISE FROM THE IRREGULARITIES OF DOMESTIC LIFE
1566-133291-0061 TO DESPISE THE NATURAL BONDS AND LEGITIMATE PLEASURES OF HOME IS TO CONTRACT A TASTE FOR EXCESSES A RESTLESSNESS OF HEART AND THE EVIL OF FLUCTUATING DESIRES AGITATED BY THE TUMULTUOUS PASSIONS WHICH FREQUENTLY DISTURB HIS DWELLING
1566-133291-0062 OF THE STATE EXACT BUT WHEN THE AMERICAN RETIRES FROM THE TURMOIL OF PUBLIC LIFE TO THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY HE FINDS IN IT THE IMAGE OF ORDER AND OF PEACE THERE HIS PLEASURES ARE SIMPLE AND NATURAL
1566-133291-0063 HIS JOYS ARE INNOCENT AND CALM AND AS HE FINDS THAT AN ORDERLY LIFE IS THE SUREST PATH TO HAPPINESS HE ACCUSTOMS HIMSELF WITHOUT DIFFICULTY TO MODERATE HIS OPINIONS AS WELL AS HIS TASTES
1566-133291-0064 WHILST THE EUROPEAN ENDEAVORS TO FORGET HIS DOMESTIC TROUBLES BY AGITATING SOCIETY THE AMERICAN DERIVES FROM HIS OWN HOME THAT LOVE OF ORDER WHICH HE AFTERWARDS CARRIES WITH HIM INTO PUBLIC AFFAIRS
1566-133291-0065 IN THE UNITED STATES THE INFLUENCE OF RELIGION IS NOT CONFINED TO THE MANNERS BUT IT EXTENDS TO THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE PEOPLE AMONGST THE ANGLO AMERICANS THERE ARE SOME WHO PROFESS THE DOCTRINES OF CHRISTIANITY
1566-133291-0066 AND OTHERS WHO DO THE SAME BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID TO BE SUSPECTED OF UNBELIEF CHRISTIANITY THEREFORE REIGNS WITHOUT ANY OBSTACLE BY UNIVERSAL CONSENT THE CONSEQUENCE IS
1566-133291-0067 ALTHOUGH THE POLITICAL WORLD IS ABANDONED TO THE DEBATES AND THE EXPERIMENTS OF MEN THUS THE HUMAN MIND IS NEVER LEFT TO WANDER ACROSS A BOUNDLESS FIELD AND WHATEVER MAY BE ITS PRETENSIONS
1566-133291-0068 IT IS CHECKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY BARRIERS WHICH IT CANNOT SURMOUNT BEFORE IT CAN PERPETRATE INNOVATION CERTAIN PRIMAL AND IMMUTABLE PRINCIPLES ARE LAID DOWN AND THE BOLDEST CONCEPTIONS OF HUMAN DEVICE ARE SUBJECTED TO CERTAIN FORMS
1566-133291-0069 WHICH RETARD AND STOP THEIR COMPLETION THE IMAGINATION OF THE AMERICANS EVEN IN ITS GREATEST FLIGHTS IS CIRCUMSPECT AND UNDECIDED ITS IMPULSES ARE CHECKED AND ITS WORKS UNFINISHED
1566-133291-0070 THESE HABITS OF RESTRAINT RECUR IN POLITICAL SOCIETY AND ARE SINGULARLY FAVORABLE BOTH TO THE TRANQUILLITY OF THE PEOPLE AND TO THE DURABILITY OF THE INSTITUTIONS IT HAS ESTABLISHED
1566-133291-0071 WITH WHICH THEY SEEK FOR FORTUNE IF THE MIND OF THE AMERICANS WERE FREE FROM ALL TRAMMELS THEY WOULD VERY SHORTLY BECOME THE MOST DARING INNOVATORS AND THE MOST IMPLACABLE DISPUTANTS IN THE WORLD
1566-133291-0072 BUT THE REVOLUTIONISTS OF AMERICA ARE OBLIGED TO PROFESS AN OSTENSIBLE RESPECT FOR CHRISTIAN MORALITY AND EQUITY WHICH DOES NOT EASILY PERMIT THEM TO VIOLATE THE LAWS THAT OPPOSE THEIR DESIGNS
1566-133291-0073 NOR WOULD THEY FIND IT EASY TO SURMOUNT THE SCRUPLES OF THEIR PARTISANS EVEN IF THEY WERE ABLE TO GET OVER THEIR OWN HITHERTO NO ONE IN THE UNITED STATES HAS DARED TO ADVANCE THE MAXIM THAT EVERYTHING IS PERMISSIBLE WITH A VIEW TO THE INTERESTS OF SOCIETY
1566-133291-0074 TO SHELTER ALL THE TYRANTS OF FUTURE AGES THUS WHILST THE LAW PERMITS THE AMERICANS TO DO WHAT THEY PLEASE RELIGION PREVENTS THEM FROM CONCEIVING AND FORBIDS THEM TO COMMIT WHAT IS RASH OR UNJUST
1566-133291-0075 RELIGION IN AMERICA TAKES NO DIRECT PART IN THE GOVERNMENT OF SOCIETY BUT IT MUST NEVERTHELESS BE REGARDED AS THE FOREMOST OF THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS OF THAT COUNTRY FOR IF IT DOES NOT IMPART A TASTE FOR FREEDOM
1566-133291-0076 IT FACILITATES THE USE OF FREE INSTITUTIONS INDEED IT IS IN THIS SAME POINT OF VIEW THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THE UNITED STATES THEMSELVES LOOK UPON RELIGIOUS BELIEF I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER ALL THE AMERICANS HAVE A SINCERE FAITH IN THEIR RELIGION
1566-133291-0077 FOR WHO CAN SEARCH THE HUMAN HEART BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT THEY HOLD IT TO BE INDISPENSABLE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF REPUBLICAN INSTITUTIONS THIS OPINION IS NOT PECULIAR TO A CLASS OF CITIZENS OR TO A PARTY BUT IT BELONGS TO THE WHOLE NATION AND TO EVERY RANK OF SOCIETY
1566-133291-0078 IF A POLITICAL CHARACTER ATTACKS A SECT THIS MAY NOT PREVENT EVEN THE PARTISANS OF THAT VERY SECT FROM SUPPORTING HIM BUT IF HE ATTACKS ALL THE SECTS TOGETHER EVERYONE ABANDONS HIM AND HE REMAINS ALONE
1566-133291-0079 WHILST I WAS IN AMERICA A WITNESS WHO HAPPENED TO BE CALLED AT THE ASSIZES OF THE COUNTY OF CHESTER
1566-133291-0080 WHICH SEEMS TO VEGETATE IN THE SOUL RATHER THAN TO LIVE I HAVE KNOWN OF SOCIETIES FORMED BY THE AMERICANS TO SEND OUT MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL INTO THE NEW WESTERN STATES
1566-133291-0081 TO FOUND SCHOOLS AND CHURCHES THERE LEST RELIGION SHOULD BE SUFFERED TO DIE AWAY IN THOSE REMOTE SETTLEMENTS AND THE RISING STATES BE LESS FITTED TO ENJOY FREE INSTITUTIONS THAN THE PEOPLE FROM WHICH THEY EMANATED
1566-133291-0082 I MET WITH WEALTHY NEW ENGLANDERS WHO ABANDONED THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY WERE BORN IN ORDER TO LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF CHRISTIANITY AND OF FREEDOM ON THE BANKS OF THE MISSOURI OR IN THE PRAIRIES OF ILLINOIS
1566-133291-0083 ETERNITY IS ONLY ONE MOTIVE OF THEIR DEVOTION TO THE CAUSE AND IF YOU CONVERSE WITH THESE MISSIONARIES OF CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO FIND HOW MUCH VALUE THEY SET UPON THE GOODS OF THIS WORLD
1566-133291-0084 AND THAT YOU MEET WITH A POLITICIAN WHERE YOU EXPECTED TO FIND A PRIEST THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT ALL THE AMERICAN REPUBLICS ARE COLLECTIVELY INVOLVED WITH EACH OTHER IF THE REPUBLICS OF THE WEST WERE TO FALL INTO ANARCHY OR TO BE MASTERED BY A DESPOT
1566-133291-0085 THE REPUBLICAN INSTITUTIONS WHICH NOW FLOURISH UPON THE SHORES OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN WOULD BE IN GREAT PERIL IT IS THEREFORE OUR INTEREST THAT THE NEW STATES SHOULD BE RELIGIOUS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR LIBERTIES
1566-133291-0086 SUCH ARE THE OPINIONS OF THE AMERICANS AND IF ANY HOLD THAT THE RELIGIOUS SPIRIT WHICH I ADMIRE IS THE VERY THING MOST AMISS IN AMERICA
1566-133291-0087 IS TO BELIEVE IN SOME BLIND COSMOGONY OR TO ASSERT WITH CABANIS THE SECRETION OF THOUGHT BY THE BRAIN I CAN ONLY REPLY THAT THOSE WHO HOLD THIS LANGUAGE HAVE NEVER BEEN IN AMERICA AND THAT THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN A RELIGIOUS OR A FREE NATION
1566-133291-0088 WHEN THEY RETURN FROM THEIR EXPEDITION WE SHALL HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY THERE ARE PERSONS IN FRANCE WHO LOOK UPON REPUBLICAN INSTITUTIONS AS A TEMPORARY MEANS OF POWER OF WEALTH AND DISTINCTION MEN WHO ARE THE CONDOTTIERI OF LIBERTY
1566-133291-0089 AND WHO FIGHT FOR THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE WHATEVER BE THE COLORS THEY WEAR IT IS NOT TO THESE THAT I ADDRESS MYSELF BUT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO LOOK FORWARD TO THE REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT AS A TRANQUIL AND LASTING STATE
1566-133291-0090 TOWARDS WHICH MODERN SOCIETY IS DAILY IMPELLED BY THE IDEAS AND MANNERS OF THE TIME AND WHO SINCERELY DESIRE TO PREPARE MEN TO BE FREE WHEN THESE MEN ATTACK RELIGIOUS OPINIONS THEY OBEY THE DICTATES OF THEIR PASSIONS
1566-133291-0091 DESPOTISM MAY GOVERN WITHOUT FAITH BUT LIBERTY CANNOT RELIGION IS MUCH MORE NECESSARY IN THE REPUBLIC WHICH THEY SET FORTH IN GLOWING COLORS THAN IN THE MONARCHY WHICH THEY ATTACK AND IT IS MORE NEEDED IN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICS
1566-133291-0092 HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT SOCIETY SHOULD ESCAPE DESTRUCTION IF THE MORAL TIE BE NOT STRENGTHENED IN PROPORTION AS THE POLITICAL TIE IS RELAXED
