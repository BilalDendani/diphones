7245-104890-0063 DEFEAT AN OUTGROWN ANGUISH REMEMBERED AS THE MILE OUR PANTING ANKLE BARELY GAINED WHEN NIGHT DEVOURED THE ROAD BUT WE STOOD WHISPERING IN THE HOUSE AND ALL WE SAID WAS SAVED
7245-104890-0064 TILL HAIR AND EYES AND TIMID HEAD ARE OUT OF SIGHT IN HEAVEN I THINK JUST HOW MY LIPS WILL WEIGH WITH SHAPELESS QUIVERING PRAYER THAT YOU SO LATE CONSIDER ME THE SPARROW OF YOUR CARE
7245-104890-0065 I MIND ME THAT OF ANGUISH SENT SOME DRIFTS WERE MOVED AWAY BEFORE MY SIMPLE BOSOM BROKE AND WHY NOT THIS IF THEY AND SO UNTIL DELIRIOUS BORNE I CON THAT THING FORGIVEN
7245-104890-0066 TILL WITH LONG FRIGHT AND LONGER TRUST I DROP MY HEART UNSHRIVEN
7245-104890-0067 THE FORGOTTEN GRAVE AFTER A HUNDRED YEARS NOBODY KNOWS THE PLACE AGONY THAT ENACTED THERE MOTIONLESS AS PEACE WEEDS TRIUMPHANT RANGED STRANGERS STROLLED AND SPELLED
7245-104890-0068 AT THE LONE ORTHOGRAPHY OF THE ELDER DEAD WINDS OF SUMMER FIELDS RECOLLECT THE WAY INSTINCT PICKING UP THE KEY DROPPED BY MEMORY
7245-104890-0069 TOO INTRINSIC FOR RENOWN LAUREL VEIL YOUR DEATHLESS TREE
