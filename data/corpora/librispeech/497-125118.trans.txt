497-125118-0000 CHAPTER FIVE BOFFIN'S BOWER OVER AGAINST A LONDON HOUSE A CORNER HOUSE NOT FAR FROM CAVENDISH SQUARE A MAN WITH A WOODEN LEG HAD SAT FOR SOME YEARS
497-125118-0001 WITH HIS REMAINING FOOT IN A BASKET IN COLD WEATHER PICKING UP A LIVING ON THIS WISE EVERY MORNING AT EIGHT O'CLOCK HE STUMPED TO THE CORNER CARRYING A CHAIR A CLOTHES HORSE A PAIR OF TRESTLES A BOARD A BASKET AND AN UMBRELLA
497-125118-0002 ALL STRAPPED TOGETHER SEPARATING THESE THE BOARD AND TRESTLES BECAME A COUNTER THE BASKET SUPPLIED THE FEW SMALL LOTS OF FRUIT AND SWEETS THAT HE OFFERED FOR SALE UPON IT AND BECAME A FOOT WARMER
497-125118-0003 THE UNFOLDED CLOTHES HORSE DISPLAYED A CHOICE COLLECTION OF HALFPENNY BALLADS AND BECAME A SCREEN AND THE STOOL PLANTED WITHIN IT BECAME HIS POST FOR THE REST OF THE DAY ALL WEATHERS SAW THE MAN AT THE POST
497-125118-0004 THIS IS TO BE ACCEPTED IN A DOUBLE SENSE FOR HE CONTRIVED A BACK TO HIS WOODEN STOOL BY PLACING IT AGAINST THE LAMP POST WHEN THE WEATHER WAS WET HE PUT UP HIS UMBRELLA OVER HIS STOCK IN TRADE NOT OVER HIMSELF
497-125118-0005 BUT HAD IN THE BEGINNING DIFFIDENTLY TAKEN THE CORNER UPON WHICH THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE GAVE A HOWLING CORNER IN THE WINTER TIME A DUSTY CORNER IN THE SUMMER TIME AN UNDESIRABLE CORNER AT THE BEST OF TIMES
497-125118-0006 SHELTERLESS FRAGMENTS OF STRAW AND PAPER GOT UP REVOLVING STORMS THERE WHEN THE MAIN STREET WAS AT PEACE AND THE WATER CART AS IF IT WERE DRUNK OR SHORT SIGHTED CAME BLUNDERING AND JOLTING ROUND IT
497-125118-0007 MAKING IT MUDDY WHEN ALL ELSE WAS CLEAN ON THE FRONT OF HIS SALE BOARD HUNG A LITTLE PLACARD LIKE A KETTLE HOLDER BEARING THE INSCRIPTION IN HIS OWN SMALL TEXT ERRANDS GONE ON WITH FI DELITY BY
497-125118-0008 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I REMAIN YOUR HUMBLE SERVT SILAS WEGG HE HAD NOT ONLY SETTLED IT WITH HIMSELF IN COURSE OF TIME THAT HE WAS ERRAND GOER BY APPOINTMENT TO THE HOUSE AT THE CORNER THOUGH HE RECEIVED SUCH COMMISSIONS NOT
497-125118-0009 HALF A DOZEN TIMES IN A YEAR AND THEN ONLY AS SOME SERVANT'S DEPUTY BUT ALSO THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE HOUSE'S RETAINERS AND OWED VASSALAGE TO IT AND WAS BOUND TO LEAL AND LOYAL INTEREST IN IT FOR THIS REASON
497-125118-0010 ON SIMILAR GROUNDS HE NEVER BEHELD AN INMATE AT ANY ONE OF ITS WINDOWS BUT HE TOUCHED HIS HAT YET HE KNEW SO LITTLE ABOUT THE INMATES THAT HE GAVE THEM NAMES OF HIS OWN INVENTION AS MISS ELIZABETH MASTER GEORGE
497-125118-0011 AUNT JANE UNCLE PARKER HAVING NO AUTHORITY WHATEVER FOR ANY SUCH DESIGNATIONS BUT PARTICULARLY THE LAST TO WHICH AS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE HE STUCK WITH GREAT OBSTINACY
497-125118-0012 OVER THE HOUSE ITSELF HE EXERCISED THE SAME IMAGINARY POWER AS OVER ITS INHABITANTS AND THEIR AFFAIRS HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN IT THE LENGTH OF A PIECE OF FAT
497-125118-0013 BLACK WATER PIPE WHICH TRAILED ITSELF OVER THE AREA DOOR INTO A DAMP STONE PASSAGE AND HAD RATHER THE AIR OF A LEECH ON THE HOUSE THAT HAD TAKEN WONDERFULLY BUT THIS WAS NO IMPEDIMENT TO HIS ARRANGING IT ACCORDING TO A PLAN OF HIS OWN
497-125118-0014 BUT THIS ONCE DONE WAS QUITE SATISFACTORY AND HE RESTED PERSUADED THAT HE KNEW HIS WAY ABOUT THE HOUSE BLINDFOLD FROM THE BARRED GARRETS IN THE HIGH ROOF TO THE TWO IRON EXTINGUISHERS BEFORE THE MAIN DOOR
497-125118-0015 IT GAVE YOU THE FACE ACHE TO LOOK AT HIS APPLES THE STOMACH ACHE TO LOOK AT HIS ORANGES THE TOOTH ACHE TO LOOK AT HIS NUTS
497-125118-0016 WHICH HAD NO DISCERNIBLE INSIDE AND WAS CONSIDERED TO REPRESENT THE PENN'ORTH APPOINTED BY MAGNA CHARTA WHETHER FROM TOO MUCH EAST WIND OR NO IT WAS AN EASTERLY CORNER THE STALL THE STOCK AND THE KEEPER
497-125118-0017 WERE ALL AS DRY AS THE DESERT WEGG WAS A KNOTTY MAN AND A CLOSE GRAINED WITH A FACE CARVED OUT OF VERY HARD MATERIAL THAT HAD JUST AS MUCH PLAY OF EXPRESSION AS A WATCHMAN'S RATTLE WHEN HE LAUGHED CERTAIN JERKS OCCURRED IN IT
497-125118-0018 AND THE RATTLE SPRUNG SOOTH TO SAY HE WAS SO WOODEN A MAN THAT HE SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN HIS WOODEN LEG NATURALLY AND RATHER SUGGESTED TO THE FANCIFUL OBSERVER THAT HE MIGHT BE EXPECTED IF HIS DEVELOPMENT RECEIVED NO UNTIMELY CHECK
497-125118-0019 TO BE COMPLETELY SET UP WITH A PAIR OF WOODEN LEGS IN ABOUT SIX MONTHS MISTER WEGG WAS AN OBSERVANT PERSON OR AS HE HIMSELF SAID TOOK A POWERFUL SIGHT OF NOTICE
497-125118-0020 HE SALUTED ALL HIS REGULAR PASSERS BY EVERY DAY AS HE SAT ON HIS STOOL BACKED UP BY THE LAMP POST AND ON THE ADAPTABLE CHARACTER OF THESE SALUTES HE GREATLY PLUMED HIMSELF THUS TO THE RECTOR HE ADDRESSED A BOW COMPOUNDED OF LAY DEFERENCE
497-125118-0021 TO THE DOCTOR A CONFIDENTIAL BOW AS TO A GENTLEMAN WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIS INSIDE HE BEGGED RESPECTFULLY TO ACKNOWLEDGE BEFORE THE QUALITY HE DELIGHTED TO ABASE HIMSELF AND FOR UNCLE PARKER WHO WAS IN THE ARMY
497-125118-0022 AT LEAST SO HE HAD SETTLED IT HE PUT HIS OPEN HAND TO THE SIDE OF HIS HAT IN A MILITARY MANNER WHICH THAT ANGRY EYED BUTTONED UP INFLAMMATORY FACED OLD GENTLEMAN APPEARED BUT IMPERFECTLY TO APPRECIATE
497-125118-0023 THE ONLY ARTICLE IN WHICH SILAS DEALT THAT WAS NOT HARD WAS GINGERBREAD ON A CERTAIN DAY SOME WRETCHED INFANT HAVING PURCHASED THE DAMP GINGERBREAD HORSE FEARFULLY OUT OF CONDITION AND THE ADHESIVE BIRD CAGE
497-125118-0024 WHICH HAD BEEN EXPOSED FOR THE DAY'S SALE HE HAD TAKEN A TIN BOX FROM UNDER HIS STOOL TO PRODUCE A RELAY OF THOSE DREADFUL SPECIMENS AND WAS GOING TO LOOK IN AT THE LID WHEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF PAUSING OH HERE YOU ARE AGAIN
497-125118-0025 HERE YOU ARE AGAIN REPEATED MISTER WEGG MUSING AND WHAT ARE YOU NOW ARE YOU IN THE FUNNS OR WHERE ARE YOU HAVE YOU LATELY COME TO SETTLE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD
497-125118-0026 HAVING REPLACED HIS TIN BOX ACCORDINGLY DID AS HE ROSE TO BAIT HIS GINGERBREAD TRAP FOR SOME OTHER DEVOTED INFANT THE SALUTE WAS ACKNOWLEDGED WITH MORNING SIR MORNING MORNING CALLS ME SIR SAID MISTER WEGG TO HIMSELF
497-125118-0027 DO YOU REMEMBER ME THEN ASKED HIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE STOPPING IN HIS AMBLE ONE SIDED BEFORE THE STALL AND SPEAKING IN A POUNDING WAY THOUGH WITH GREAT GOOD HUMOUR
497-125118-0028 OH NOW WHAT PURSUED THE OLD FELLOW IN AN INQUISITIVE MANNER CARRYING HIS KNOTTED STICK IN HIS LEFT ARM AS IF IT WERE A BABY WHAT DO THEY ALLOW YOU NOW IT'S JOB WORK THAT I DO FOR OUR HOUSE
497-125118-0029 RETURNED SILAS DRILY AND WITH RETICENCE IT'S NOT YET BROUGHT TO AN EXACT ALLOWANCE OH IT'S NOT YET BROUGHT TO AN EXACT ALLOWANCE NO IT'S NOT YET BROUGHT TO AN EXACT ALLOWANCE OH MORNING MORNING MORNING
497-125118-0030 THOUGHT SILAS QUALIFYING HIS FORMER GOOD OPINION AS THE OTHER AMBLED OFF BUT IN A MOMENT HE WAS BACK AGAIN WITH THE QUESTION HOW DID YOU GET YOUR WOODEN LEG
497-125118-0031 MISTER WEGG REPLIED TARTLY TO THIS PERSONAL INQUIRY IN AN ACCIDENT DO YOU LIKE IT WELL I HAVEN'T GOT TO KEEP IT WARM
497-125118-0032 MISTER WEGG MADE ANSWER IN A SORT OF DESPERATION OCCASIONED BY THE SINGULARITY OF THE QUESTION HE HASN'T REPEATED THE OTHER TO HIS KNOTTED STICK AS HE GAVE IT A HUG HE HASN'T GOT HA HA TO KEEP IT WARM
497-125118-0033 NO SAID MISTER WEGG WHO WAS GROWING RESTIVE UNDER THIS EXAMINATION I NEVER DID HEAR OF THE NAME OF BOFFIN DO YOU LIKE IT WHY NO
