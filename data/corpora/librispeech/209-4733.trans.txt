209-4733-0000 DO YOU REALLY THINK IT A BAD THING WHY SO I THINK THEY WILL NEITHER OF THEM DO THE OTHER ANY GOOD
209-4733-0001 EMMA MUST DO HARRIET GOOD AND BY SUPPLYING HER WITH A NEW OBJECT OF INTEREST HARRIET MAY BE SAID TO DO EMMA GOOD I HAVE BEEN SEEING THEIR INTIMACY WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE HOW VERY DIFFERENTLY WE FEEL NOT THINK THEY WILL DO EACH OTHER ANY GOOD
209-4733-0002 THIS WILL CERTAINLY BE THE BEGINNING OF ONE OF OUR QUARRELS ABOUT EMMA MISTER KNIGHTLEY
209-4733-0003 KNOWING WESTON TO BE OUT AND THAT YOU MUST STILL FIGHT YOUR OWN BATTLE MISTER WESTON WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY SUPPORT ME IF HE WERE HERE FOR HE THINKS EXACTLY AS I DO ON THE SUBJECT WE WERE SPEAKING OF IT ONLY YESTERDAY AND AGREEING HOW FORTUNATE IT WAS FOR EMMA
209-4733-0004 THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUCH A GIRL IN HIGHBURY FOR HER TO ASSOCIATE WITH MISTER KNIGHTLEY I SHALL NOT ALLOW YOU TO BE A FAIR JUDGE IN THIS CASE YOU ARE SO MUCH USED TO LIVE ALONE
209-4733-0005 AND PERHAPS NO MAN CAN BE A GOOD JUDGE OF THE COMFORT A WOMAN FEELS IN THE SOCIETY OF ONE OF HER OWN SEX AFTER BEING USED TO IT ALL HER LIFE I CAN IMAGINE YOUR OBJECTION TO HARRIET SMITH SHE IS NOT THE SUPERIOR YOUNG WOMAN WHICH EMMA'S FRIEND OUGHT TO BE
209-4733-0006 BUT ON THE OTHER HAND AS EMMA WANTS TO SEE HER BETTER INFORMED IT WILL BE AN INDUCEMENT TO HER TO READ MORE HERSELF THEY WILL READ TOGETHER SHE MEANS IT I KNOW EMMA HAS BEEN MEANING TO READ MORE EVER SINCE SHE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD
209-4733-0007 THE LIST SHE DREW UP WHEN ONLY FOURTEEN I REMEMBER THINKING IT DID HER JUDGMENT SO MUCH CREDIT THAT I PRESERVED IT SOME TIME AND I DARE SAY SHE MAY HAVE MADE OUT A VERY GOOD LIST NOW BUT I HAVE DONE WITH EXPECTING ANY COURSE OF STEADY READING FROM EMMA
209-4733-0008 SHE WILL NEVER SUBMIT TO ANY THING REQUIRING INDUSTRY AND PATIENCE AND A SUBJECTION OF THE FANCY TO THE UNDERSTANDING WHERE MISS TAYLOR FAILED TO STIMULATE I MAY SAFELY AFFIRM THAT HARRIET SMITH WILL DO NOTHING
209-4733-0009 YOU NEVER COULD PERSUADE HER TO READ HALF SO MUCH AS YOU WISHED YOU KNOW YOU COULD NOT I DARE SAY REPLIED MISSUS WESTON SMILING THAT I THOUGHT SO THEN BUT SINCE WE HAVE PARTED I CAN NEVER REMEMBER EMMA'S OMITTING TO DO ANY THING I WISHED
209-4733-0010 THERE IS HARDLY ANY DESIRING TO REFRESH SUCH A MEMORY AS THAT SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY FEELINGLY AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO HE HAD DONE BUT I HE SOON ADDED WHO HAVE HAD NO SUCH CHARM THROWN OVER MY SENSES
209-4733-0011 MUST STILL SEE HEAR AND REMEMBER EMMA IS SPOILED BY BEING THE CLEVEREST OF HER FAMILY AT TEN YEARS OLD SHE HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WHICH PUZZLED HER SISTER AT SEVENTEEN SHE WAS ALWAYS QUICK AND ASSURED
209-4733-0012 ISABELLA SLOW AND DIFFIDENT AND EVER SINCE SHE WAS TWELVE EMMA HAS BEEN MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AND OF YOU ALL IN HER MOTHER SHE LOST THE ONLY PERSON ABLE TO COPE WITH HER SHE INHERITS HER MOTHER'S TALENTS AND MUST HAVE BEEN UNDER SUBJECTION TO HER
209-4733-0013 I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY MISTER KNIGHTLEY TO BE DEPENDENT ON YOUR RECOMMENDATION HAD I QUITTED MISTER WOODHOUSE'S FAMILY AND WANTED ANOTHER SITUATION
209-4733-0014 I AM SURE YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT ME UNFIT FOR THE OFFICE I HELD YES SAID HE SMILING YOU ARE BETTER PLACED HERE
209-4733-0015 BUT YOU WERE PREPARING YOURSELF TO BE AN EXCELLENT WIFE ALL THE TIME YOU WERE AT HARTFIELD YOU MIGHT NOT GIVE EMMA SUCH A COMPLETE EDUCATION AS YOUR POWERS WOULD SEEM TO PROMISE BUT YOU WERE RECEIVING A VERY GOOD EDUCATION FROM HER
209-4733-0016 WHY TO OWN THE TRUTH I AM AFRAID YOU ARE RATHER THROWN AWAY AND THAT WITH EVERY DISPOSITION TO BEAR THERE WILL BE NOTHING TO BE BORNE WE WILL NOT DESPAIR HOWEVER WESTON MAY GROW CROSS FROM THE WANTONNESS OF COMFORT OR HIS SON MAY PLAGUE HIM
209-4733-0017 I HOPE NOT THAT IT IS NOT LIKELY NO MISTER KNIGHTLEY DO NOT FORETELL VEXATION FROM THAT QUARTER NOT I INDEED I ONLY NAME POSSIBILITIES I DO NOT PRETEND TO EMMA'S GENIUS FOR FORETELLING AND GUESSING
209-4733-0018 HOW CAN EMMA IMAGINE SHE HAS ANY THING TO LEARN HERSELF WHILE HARRIET IS PRESENTING SUCH A DELIGHTFUL INFERIORITY AND AS FOR HARRIET I WILL VENTURE TO SAY THAT SHE CANNOT GAIN BY THE ACQUAINTANCE
209-4733-0019 HARTFIELD WILL ONLY PUT HER OUT OF CONCEIT WITH ALL THE OTHER PLACES SHE BELONGS TO SHE WILL GROW JUST REFINED ENOUGH TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THOSE AMONG WHOM BIRTH AND CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE PLACED HER HOME
209-4733-0020 I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF EMMA'S DOCTRINES GIVE ANY STRENGTH OF MIND OR TEND AT ALL TO MAKE A GIRL ADAPT HERSELF RATIONALLY
209-4733-0021 OH YOU WOULD RATHER TALK OF HER PERSON THAN HER MIND WOULD YOU VERY WELL I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO DENY EMMA'S BEING PRETTY PRETTY SAY BEAUTIFUL RATHER CAN YOU IMAGINE ANY THING NEARER PERFECT BEAUTY THAN EMMA ALTOGETHER
209-4733-0022 FACE AND FIGURE I
209-4733-0023 BUT I CONFESS THAT I HAVE SELDOM SEEN A FACE OR FIGURE MORE PLEASING TO ME THAN HERS BUT I AM A PARTIAL OLD FRIEND SUCH AN EYE THE TRUE HAZLE EYE AND SO BRILLIANT REGULAR FEATURES
209-4733-0024 WHAT A BLOOM OF FULL HEALTH AND SUCH A PRETTY HEIGHT AND SIZE SUCH A FIRM AND UPRIGHT FIGURE THERE IS HEALTH NOT MERELY IN HER BLOOM BUT IN HER AIR HER HEAD HER GLANCE ONE HEARS SOMETIMES OF A CHILD BEING THE PICTURE OF HEALTH
209-4733-0025 NOW EMMA ALWAYS GIVES ME THE IDEA OF BEING THE COMPLETE PICTURE OF GROWN UP HEALTH SHE IS LOVELINESS ITSELF MISTER KNIGHTLEY IS NOT SHE I HAVE NOT A FAULT TO FIND WITH HER PERSON HE REPLIED I THINK HER ALL YOU DESCRIBE I LOVE TO LOOK AT HER
209-4733-0026 OR MY DREAD OF ITS DOING THEM BOTH HARM AND I MISTER KNIGHTLEY AM EQUALLY STOUT IN MY CONFIDENCE OF ITS NOT DOING THEM ANY HARM WITH ALL DEAR EMMA'S LITTLE FAULTS SHE IS AN EXCELLENT CREATURE WHERE SHALL WE SEE A BETTER DAUGHTER
209-4733-0027 OR A KINDER SISTER OR A TRUER FRIEND NO NO SHE HAS QUALITIES WHICH MAY BE TRUSTED SHE WILL NEVER LEAD ANY ONE REALLY WRONG SHE WILL MAKE NO LASTING BLUNDER WHERE EMMA ERRS ONCE SHE IS IN THE RIGHT A HUNDRED TIMES
209-4733-0028 I CONSIDER MYSELF YOU KNOW AS HAVING SOMEWHAT OF THE PRIVILEGE OF SPEECH THAT EMMA'S MOTHER MIGHT HAVE HAD THE LIBERTY OF HINTING THAT I DO NOT THINK ANY POSSIBLE GOOD CAN ARISE FROM HARRIET SMITH'S INTIMACY BEING MADE A MATTER OF MUCH DISCUSSION AMONG YOU PRAY EXCUSE ME
209-4733-0029 BUT SUPPOSING ANY LITTLE INCONVENIENCE MAY BE APPREHENDED FROM THE INTIMACY IT CANNOT BE EXPECTED THAT EMMA ACCOUNTABLE TO NOBODY BUT HER FATHER WHO PERFECTLY APPROVES THE ACQUAINTANCE SHOULD PUT AN END TO IT SO LONG AS IT IS A SOURCE OF PLEASURE TO HERSELF
209-4733-0030 IT HAS BEEN SO MANY YEARS MY PROVINCE TO GIVE ADVICE THAT YOU CANNOT BE SURPRIZED MISTER KNIGHTLEY AT THIS LITTLE REMAINS OF OFFICE NOT AT ALL CRIED HE I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR IT
209-4733-0031 I WILL NOT RAISE ANY OUTCRY I WILL KEEP MY ILL HUMOUR TO MYSELF I HAVE A VERY SINCERE INTEREST IN EMMA ISABELLA DOES NOT SEEM MORE MY SISTER HAS NEVER EXCITED A GREATER INTEREST PERHAPS HARDLY SO GREAT
209-4733-0032 THERE IS AN ANXIETY A CURIOSITY IN WHAT ONE FEELS FOR EMMA I WONDER WHAT WILL BECOME OF HER SO DO I SAID MISSUS WESTON GENTLY VERY MUCH
209-4733-0033 SHE ALWAYS DECLARES SHE WILL NEVER MARRY WHICH OF COURSE MEANS JUST NOTHING AT ALL BUT I HAVE NO IDEA THAT SHE HAS YET EVER SEEN A MAN SHE CARED FOR IT WOULD NOT BE A BAD THING FOR HER TO BE VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH A PROPER OBJECT
209-4733-0034 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE EMMA IN LOVE AND IN SOME DOUBT OF A RETURN IT WOULD DO HER GOOD BUT THERE IS NOBODY HEREABOUTS TO ATTACH HER AND SHE GOES SO SELDOM FROM HOME THERE DOES INDEED
209-4733-0035 SEEM AS LITTLE TO TEMPT HER TO BREAK HER RESOLUTION AT PRESENT SAID MISSUS WESTON AS CAN WELL BE AND WHILE SHE IS SO HAPPY AT HARTFIELD I CANNOT WISH HER TO BE FORMING ANY ATTACHMENT WHICH WOULD BE CREATING SUCH DIFFICULTIES ON POOR MISTER WOODHOUSE'S ACCOUNT
