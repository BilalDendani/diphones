5588-68188-0000 ROSA'S LOVER ROSA HAD SCARCELY PRONOUNCED THESE CONSOLATORY WORDS WHEN A VOICE WAS HEARD FROM THE STAIRCASE ASKING GRYPHUS HOW MATTERS WERE GOING ON DO YOU HEAR FATHER SAID ROSA WHAT MASTER JACOB CALLS YOU
5588-68188-0001 AFTER THIS HE LOCKED THE DOOR AND CALLED OUT I SHALL BE WITH YOU DIRECTLY FRIEND JACOB POOR CORNELIUS THUS LEFT ALONE WITH HIS BITTER GRIEF MUTTERED TO HIMSELF AH YOU OLD HANGMAN IT IS ME YOU HAVE TRODDEN UNDER FOOT
5588-68188-0002 THAT HENCEFORTH HER FATHER WOULD MAKE NO OBJECTION TO HIS CULTIVATING FLOWERS AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THE PRISONER ASKED WITH A DOLEFUL LOOK
5588-68188-0003 AH MASTER JACOB
5588-68188-0004 SAYING THIS SHE SMILED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE LITTLE CLOUD OF JEALOUSY WHICH HAD DARKENED THE BROW OF CORNELIUS SPEEDILY VANISHED HOW WAS IT ASKED THE PRISONER WELL BEING ASKED BY HIS FRIEND
5588-68188-0005 MY FATHER TOLD AT SUPPER THE WHOLE STORY OF THE TULIP OR RATHER OF THE BULB AND OF HIS OWN FINE EXPLOIT OF CRUSHING IT CORNELIUS HEAVED A SIGH WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN CALLED A GROAN
5588-68188-0006 HAD YOU ONLY SEEN MASTER JACOB AT THAT MOMENT CONTINUED ROSA I REALLY THOUGHT HE WOULD SET FIRE TO THE CASTLE HIS EYES WERE LIKE TWO FLAMING TORCHES HIS HAIR STOOD ON END AND HE CLINCHED HIS FIST FOR A MOMENT
5588-68188-0007 YOU HAVE DONE THAT HE CRIED YOU HAVE CRUSHED THE BULB INDEED I HAVE IT IS INFAMOUS SAID MASTER JACOB IT IS ODIOUS YOU HAVE COMMITTED A GREAT CRIME MY FATHER WAS QUITE DUMBFOUNDED
5588-68188-0008 ARE YOU MAD TOO HE ASKED HIS FRIEND
5588-68188-0009 CRUSHED THE BULB MY GOD MY GOD CRUSHED THEN TURNING TOWARD ME HE ASKED BUT IT WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HE HAD DID HE ASK THAT INQUIRED CORNELIUS WITH SOME ANXIETY
5588-68188-0010 YOU THINK IT WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE SAID MY FATHER VERY WELL WE SHALL SEARCH FOR THE OTHERS YOU WILL SEARCH FOR THE OTHERS CRIED JACOB TAKING MY FATHER BY THE COLLAR BUT HE IMMEDIATELY LOOSED HIM THEN TURNING TOWARDS ME
5588-68188-0011 HE CONTINUED ASKING AND WHAT DID THAT POOR YOUNG MAN SAY I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO ANSWER AS YOU HAD SO STRICTLY ENJOINED ME NEVER TO ALLOW ANY ONE TO GUESS THE INTEREST WHICH YOU ARE TAKING IN THE BULB FORTUNATELY
5588-68188-0012 WELL NOW ARE YOU MAD CRIED MY FATHER WHAT IMMENSE MISFORTUNE IS IT TO CRUSH A TULIP BULB YOU MAY BUY A HUNDRED OF THEM IN THE MARKET OF GORCUM PERHAPS SOME LESS PRECIOUS ONE THAN THAT WAS I QUITE INCAUTIOUSLY REPLIED
5588-68188-0013 AND WHAT DID JACOB SAY OR DO AT THESE WORDS ASKED CORNELIUS AT THESE WORDS IF I MUST SAY IT HIS EYES SEEMED TO FLASH LIKE LIGHTNING BUT SAID CORNELIUS THAT WAS NOT ALL I AM SURE HE SAID SOMETHING IN HIS TURN
5588-68188-0014 SO THEN MY PRETTY ROSA HE SAID
5588-68188-0015 I SAW THAT I HAD MADE A BLUNDER WHAT DO I KNOW I SAID NEGLIGENTLY DO I UNDERSTAND ANYTHING OF TULIPS I ONLY KNOW AS UNFORTUNATELY IT IS OUR LOT TO LIVE WITH PRISONERS THAT FOR THEM ANY PASTIME IS OF VALUE
5588-68188-0016 TO PROCURE THIS BULB I TURNED MY EYES AWAY TO AVOID MY FATHER'S LOOK BUT I MET THOSE OF JACOB IT WAS AS IF HE HAD TRIED TO READ MY THOUGHTS AT THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART SOME LITTLE SHOW OF ANGER SOMETIMES SAVES AN ANSWER
5588-68188-0017 I SHRUGGED MY SHOULDERS TURNED MY BACK AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THE DOOR BUT I WAS KEPT BY SOMETHING WHICH I HEARD ALTHOUGH IT WAS UTTERED IN A VERY LOW VOICE ONLY JACOB SAID TO MY FATHER IT WOULD NOT BE SO DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN THAT
5588-68188-0018 HOW SO YOU NEED ONLY SEARCH HIS PERSON AND IF HE HAS THE OTHER BULBS WE SHALL FIND THEM AS THERE USUALLY ARE THREE SUCKERS THREE SUCKERS CRIED CORNELIUS DID YOU SAY THAT I HAVE THREE THE WORD CERTAINLY STRUCK ME
5588-68188-0019 THEN TAKE HIM DOWN UNDER SOME PRETEXT OR OTHER AND I WILL SEARCH HIS CELL IN THE MEANWHILE HALLOA HALLOA SAID CORNELIUS BUT THIS MISTER JACOB OF YOURS IS A VILLAIN IT SEEMS I AM AFRAID HE IS
5588-68188-0020 CERTAINLY THAT NOT ONE OF YOUR MOVEMENTS ESCAPED HIM NOT ONE INDEED ROSA SAID CORNELIUS GROWING QUITE PALE WELL IT WAS NOT YOU HE WAS AFTER WHO ELSE THEN
5588-68188-0021 IT IS NOT YOU THAT HE WAS IN LOVE WITH BUT WITH WHOM ELSE HE WAS AFTER MY BULB AND IS IN LOVE WITH MY TULIP YOU DON'T SAY SO AND YET IT IS VERY POSSIBLE SAID ROSA
5588-68188-0022 WILL YOU MAKE SURE OF IT IN WHAT MANNER OH IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TELL ME GO TO MORROW INTO THE GARDEN MANAGE MATTERS SO THAT JACOB MAY KNOW AS HE DID THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU ARE GOING THERE
5588-68188-0023 AND THAT HE MAY FOLLOW YOU FEIGN TO PUT THE BULB INTO THE GROUND LEAVE THE GARDEN BUT LOOK THROUGH THE KEYHOLE OF THE DOOR AND WATCH HIM WELL
5588-68188-0024 WE SHALL DO AS HE DOES OH SAID ROSA WITH A SIGH YOU ARE VERY FOND OF YOUR BULBS TO TELL THE TRUTH SAID THE PRISONER SIGHING LIKEWISE SINCE YOUR FATHER CRUSHED THAT UNFORTUNATE BULB
5588-68188-0025 I FEEL AS IF PART OF MY OWN SELF HAD BEEN PARALYZED NOW JUST HEAR ME SAID ROSA WILL YOU TRY SOMETHING ELSE WHAT WILL YOU ACCEPT THE PROPOSITION OF MY FATHER WHICH PROPOSITION
5588-68188-0026 TULIP BULBS BY HUNDREDS INDEED HE DID ACCEPT TWO OR THREE AND ALONG WITH THEM YOU MAY GROW THE THIRD SUCKER YES THAT WOULD DO VERY WELL SAID CORNELIUS KNITTING HIS BROW IF YOUR FATHER WERE ALONE
5588-68188-0027 WHO WATCHES ALL OUR WAYS WELL THAT IS TRUE BUT ONLY THINK YOU ARE DEPRIVING YOURSELF AS I CAN EASILY SEE OF A VERY GREAT PLEASURE SHE PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS WITH A SMILE
5588-68188-0028 WHICH WAS NOT ALTOGETHER WITHOUT A TINGE OF IRONY CORNELIUS REFLECTED FOR A MOMENT HE EVIDENTLY WAS STRUGGLING AGAINST SOME VEHEMENT DESIRE NO HE CRIED AT LAST WITH THE STOICISM OF A ROMAN OF OLD
5588-68188-0029 IT WOULD BE A WEAKNESS IT WOULD BE A FOLLY IT WOULD BE A MEANNESS IF I THUS GIVE UP THE ONLY AND LAST RESOURCE WHICH WE POSSESS TO THE UNCERTAIN CHANCES OF THE BAD PASSIONS OF ANGER AND ENVY
5588-68188-0030 I SHOULD NEVER DESERVE TO BE FORGIVEN NO ROSA NO TO MORROW WE SHALL COME TO A CONCLUSION
5588-68188-0031 YOU WILL PLANT IT ACCORDING TO MY INSTRUCTIONS AND AS TO THE THIRD SUCKER CORNELIUS HERE HEAVED A DEEP SIGH WATCH OVER IT AS A MISER OVER HIS FIRST OR LAST PIECE OF GOLD AS THE MOTHER OVER HER CHILD
5588-68188-0032 AS THE WOUNDED OVER THE LAST DROP OF BLOOD IN HIS VEINS
5588-68188-0033 SOME VOICE WITHIN ME TELLS ME THAT IT WILL BE OUR SAVING THAT IT WILL BE A SOURCE OF GOOD TO US BE EASY MYNHEER CORNELIUS SAID ROSA WITH A SWEET MIXTURE OF MELANCHOLY AND GRAVITY BE EASY YOUR WISHES ARE COMMANDS TO ME
5588-68188-0034 ME WHO HAVE NO ONE IN THE WORLD BUT YOU SACRIFICE ME DON'T COME TO SEE ME ANY MORE ROSA FELT HER HEART SINK WITHIN HER AND HER EYES WERE FILLING WITH TEARS ALAS SHE SAID WHAT IS IT
5588-68188-0035 ASKED CORNELIUS I SEE ONE THING WHAT DO YOU SEE
5588-68188-0036 ROSA WAS VEXED WITH HIM AND WITH GOOD REASON PERHAPS SHE WOULD NEVER RETURN TO SEE THE PRISONER AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE NO MORE NEWS EITHER OF ROSA OR OF HIS TULIPS WE HAVE TO CONFESS TO THE DISGRACE OF OUR HERO
5588-68188-0037 AND OF FLORICULTURE THAT OF HIS TWO AFFECTIONS HE FELT MOST STRONGLY INCLINED TO REGRET THE LOSS OF ROSA
