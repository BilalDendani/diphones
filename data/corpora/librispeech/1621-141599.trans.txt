1621-141599-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION THIS LITTLE VOLUME HAS NECESSARILY TOUCHED UPON A GREAT VARIETY OF SUBJECTS IN ORDER TO DEAL IN A TOLERABLY COMPLETE MANNER WITH THE VERY
1621-141599-0001 IT MAY THEREFORE BE WELL TO SUM UP THE MAIN POINTS OF THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST HIS VIEW INTRODUCING A FEW OTHER FACTS AND CONSIDERATIONS WHICH GREATLY STRENGTHEN MY ARGUMENT
1621-141599-0002 THE ONE GREAT FEATURE OF MARS WHICH LED MISTER LOWELL TO ADOPT THE VIEW OF ITS BEING INHABITED BY A RACE OF HIGHLY INTELLIGENT BEINGS AND WITH EVER INCREASING DISCOVERY TO UPHOLD THIS THEORY TO THE PRESENT TIME
1621-141599-0003 THEIR ENORMOUS LENGTH THEIR GREAT ABUNDANCE AND THEIR EXTENSION OVER THE PLANET'S WHOLE SURFACE FROM ONE POLAR SNOW CAP TO THE OTHER
1621-141599-0004 THE VERY IMMENSITY OF THIS SYSTEM AND ITS CONSTANT GROWTH AND EXTENSION DURING FIFTEEN YEARS OF PERSISTENT OBSERVATION HAVE SO COMPLETELY TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIS MIND THAT AFTER A VERY HASTY GLANCE
1621-141599-0005 AT ANALOGOUS FACTS AND POSSIBILITIES HE HAS DECLARED THEM TO BE NON NATURAL' THEREFORE TO BE WORKS OF ART THEREFORE TO NECESSITATE THE PRESENCE OF HIGHLY INTELLIGENT BEINGS
1621-141599-0006 WHO HAVE DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED THEM THIS IDEA HAS COLOURED OR GOVERNED ALL HIS WRITINGS ON THE SUBJECT THE INNUMERABLE DIFFICULTIES WHICH IT RAISES HAVE BEEN EITHER IGNORED OR BRUSHED ASIDE ON THE FLIMSIEST EVIDENCE
1621-141599-0007 AS EXAMPLES HE NEVER EVEN DISCUSSES THE TOTALLY INADEQUATE WATER SUPPLY FOR SUCH WORLDWIDE IRRIGATION OR THE EXTREME IRRATIONALITY OF CONSTRUCTING SO VAST A CANAL SYSTEM THE WASTE FROM WHICH BY EVAPORATION
1621-141599-0008 WHEN EXPOSED TO SUCH DESERT CONDITIONS AS HE HIMSELF DESCRIBES WOULD USE UP TEN TIMES THE PROBABLE SUPPLY AGAIN HE URGES THE PURPOSE DISPLAYED IN THESE CANALS THEIR BEING ALL SO STRAIGHT
1621-141599-0009 ALL DESCRIBING GREAT CIRCLES OF THE SPHERE ALL BEING SO EVIDENTLY ARRANGED AS HE THINKS EITHER TO CARRY WATER TO SOME OASIS TWO THOUSAND MILES AWAY OR TO REACH SOME ARID REGION FAR OVER THE EQUATOR IN THE OPPOSITE HEMISPHERE
1621-141599-0010 BUT HE NEVER CONSIDERS THE DIFFICULTIES THIS IMPLIES EVERYWHERE THESE CANALS RUN FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES ACROSS WATERLESS DESERTS FORMING A SYSTEM AND INDICATING A PURPOSE THE WONDERFUL PERFECTION OF WHICH
1621-141599-0011 BUT WHICH I MYSELF CAN NOWHERE PERCEIVE YET HE NEVER EVEN ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN HOW THE MARTIANS COULD HAVE LIVED BEFORE THIS GREAT SYSTEM WAS PLANNED AND EXECUTED OR WHY THEY DID NOT
1621-141599-0012 FIRST UTILISE AND RENDER FERTILE THE BELT OF LAND ADJACENT TO THE LIMITS OF THE POLAR SNOWS
1621-141599-0013 AND CHANNELS TO IRRIGATE THE LAND CLOSE TO THE SOURCE OF THE WATER
1621-141599-0014 FOURTHS OF MARS TO BE DID THE INHABITANTS EVER GET TO KNOW ANYTHING OF THE EQUATORIAL REGIONS AND ITS NEEDS
1621-141599-0015 RIGHT AWAY TO SUPPLY THOSE NEEDS ALL THIS TO MY MIND IS QUITE OPPOSED TO THE IDEA OF THEIR BEING WORKS OF ART
1621-141599-0016 AS PECULIAR IN ORIGIN AND INTERNAL STRUCTURE AS IT IS IN ITS SURFACE FEATURES
1621-141599-0017 AND IS I SUGGEST FAR MORE SCIENTIFIC AS WELL AS MORE SATISFACTORY THAN MISTER LOWELL'S WHOLLY UNSUPPORTED SPECULATION THIS VIEW I HAVE EXPLAINED IN SOME DETAIL IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER
1621-141599-0018 MISTER LOWELL NEVER EVEN REFERS TO THE IMPORTANT QUESTION OF LOSS BY EVAPORATION IN THESE ENORMOUS OPEN CANALS OR CONSIDERS THE UNDOUBTED FACT THAT THE ONLY INTELLIGENT AND PRACTICAL WAY
1621-141599-0019 SUCH GREAT DISTANCES WOULD BE BY A SYSTEM OF WATER TIGHT AND AIR TIGHT TUBES LAID UNDER THE GROUND THE MERE ATTEMPT TO USE OPEN CANALS FOR SUCH A PURPOSE
1621-141599-0020 WHILE IT IS CERTAIN THAT LONG BEFORE HALF OF THEM WERE COMPLETED THEIR FAILURE TO BE OF ANY USE WOULD HAVE LED ANY RATIONAL BEINGS TO CEASE CONSTRUCTING THEM HE ALSO FAILS TO CONSIDER THE DIFFICULTY THAT
1621-141599-0021 HOW DID THE INHABITANTS EVER REACH A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE POPULATION WITH SURPLUS FOOD AND LEISURE ENABLING THEM TO RISE FROM THE LOW CONDITION OF SAVAGES TO ONE OF CIVILISATION AND ULTIMATELY TO SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE
1621-141599-0022 HERE AGAIN IS A DILEMMA WHICH IS HARD TO OVERCOME ONLY A DENSE POPULATION WITH AMPLE MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE CONSTRUCTED SUCH GIGANTIC WORKS BUT GIVEN THESE TWO CONDITIONS
1621-141599-0023 NO ADEQUATE MOTIVE EXISTED FOR THE CONCEPTION AND EXECUTION OF THEM EVEN IF THEY WERE LIKELY TO BE OF ANY USE WHICH I HAVE SHOWN THEY COULD NOT BE FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS ON THE CLIMATE OF MARS
1621-141599-0024 RECURRING NOW TO THE QUESTION OF CLIMATE WHICH IS ALL IMPORTANT MISTER LOWELL NEVER EVEN DISCUSSES THE ESSENTIAL POINT THE TEMPERATURE THAT MUST NECESSARILY RESULT FROM AN ATMOSPHERIC ENVELOPE
1621-141599-0025 ONE TWELFTH OR AT MOST ONE SEVENTH THE DENSITY OF OUR OWN IN EITHER CASE CORRESPONDING TO AN ALTITUDE FAR GREATER THAN THAT OF OUR HIGHEST MOUNTAINS
1621-141599-0026 SURELY THIS PHENOMENON EVERYWHERE MANIFESTED ON THE EARTH EVEN UNDER THE EQUATOR OF A REGULAR DECREASE OF TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE THE ONLY CAUSE OF WHICH IS A LESS DENSE ATMOSPHERE
1621-141599-0027 SHOULD HAVE BEEN FAIRLY GRAPPLED WITH AND SOME ATTEMPT MADE TO SHOW WHY IT SHOULD NOT APPLY TO MARS EXCEPT THE WEAK REMARK THAT ON A LEVEL SURFACE
1621-141599-0028 BUT IT DOES HAVE THE SAME EFFECT OR VERY NEARLY SO ON OUR LOFTY PLATEAUX OFTEN HUNDREDS OF MILES IN EXTENT IN PROPORTION TO THEIR ALTITUDE QUITO
1621-141599-0029 AT THE MOUTH OF THE RIO NEGRO THIS IS ABOUT A DEGREE FOR EACH FOUR HUNDRED FEET WHILE THE GENERAL FALL FOR ISOLATED MOUNTAINS IS ABOUT ONE DEGREE IN THREE HUNDRED FORTY FEET ACCORDING TO HUMBOLDT WHO NOTES
1621-141599-0030 OR MORE USUALLY SHELTERED VALLEYS IN WHICH THE TOWNS ARE SITUATED
1621-141599-0031 BUT IF THIS WERE THE CASE THE SOIL AT GREAT ALTITUDES NOT HAVING SO MUCH OF ITS HEAT TAKEN UP BY THE AIR SHOULD BE WARMER THAN BELOW
1621-141599-0032 BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT BECOME WARMER THE MORE CORRECT VIEW SEEMS TO BE THAT THE LOSS OF HEAT BY RADIATION IS INCREASED SO MUCH THROUGH THE RARITY OF THE AIR ABOVE IT AS TO MORE THAN COUNTERBALANCE THE INCREASED INSOLATION
1621-141599-0033 SO THAT THOUGH THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH AT A GIVEN ALTITUDE MAY RECEIVE TEN PER CENT MORE DIRECT SUN HEAT IT LOSES BY DIRECT RADIATION COMBINED WITH DIMINISHED AIR AND CLOUD RADIATION PERHAPS TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE PER CENT MORE
1621-141599-0034 WHENCE THERE IS A RESULTANT COOLING EFFECT OF TEN OR FIFTEEN PER CENT THIS ACTS BY DAY AS WELL AS BY NIGHT
1621-141599-0035 WITH A DENSER ATMOSPHERE THIS EFFECT IS FURTHER INTENSIFIED BY THE FACT THAT A LESS DENSE CANNOT ABSORB AND TRANSMIT SO MUCH HEAT AS A MORE DENSE ATMOSPHERE
1621-141599-0036 THIS LAW IS THAT REDUCED ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE INCREASES RADIATION OR LOSS OF HEAT MORE RAPIDLY THAN IT INCREASES INSOLATION OR GAIN OF HEAT SO THAT THE RESULT IS ALWAYS A CONSIDERABLE LOWERING OF TEMPERATURE
1621-141599-0037 WHAT THIS LOWERING IS CAN BE SEEN IN THE UNIVERSAL FACT THAT EVEN WITHIN THE TROPICS PERPETUAL SNOW COVERS THE HIGHER MOUNTAIN SUMMITS WHILE ON THE HIGH PLAINS OF THE ANDES AT FIFTEEN THOUSAND OR SIXTEEN THOUSAND FEET ALTITUDE
1621-141599-0038 TRAVELLERS ARE OFTEN FROZEN TO DEATH WHEN DELAYED BY STORMS YET AT THIS ELEVATION THE ATMOSPHERE HAS MUCH MORE THAN DOUBLE THE DENSITY OF THAT OF MARS
1621-141599-0039 THE ERROR IN MISTER LOWELL'S ARGUMENT IS THAT HE CLAIMS FOR THE SCANTY ATMOSPHERE OF MARS THAT IT ALLOWS MORE SUN HEAT TO REACH THE SURFACE BUT HE OMITS TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE ENORMOUSLY INCREASED LOSS OF HEAT BY DIRECT RADIATION
1621-141599-0040 A FACT WHICH ALSO SERVES TO INDICATE A VERY LOW TEMPERATURE FOR MARS
1621-141599-0041 THESE TWO INDEPENDENT ARGUMENTS FROM ALPINE TEMPERATURES AND FROM THOSE OF THE MOON SUPPORT AND ENFORCE EACH OTHER AND AFFORD A CONCLUSIVE PROOF AS AGAINST ANYTHING ADVANCED BY MISTER LOWELL THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF MARS MUST BE FAR TOO LOW TO SUPPORT ANIMAL LIFE
1621-141599-0042 A THIRD INDEPENDENT ARGUMENT LEADING TO THE SAME RESULT IS DOCTOR JOHNSTONE STONEY'S PROOF
1621-141599-0043 TO PUT THE WHOLE CASE IN THE FEWEST POSSIBLE WORDS
1621-141599-0044 ALL PHYSICISTS ARE AGREED THAT OWING TO THE DISTANCE OF MARS FROM THE SUN IT WOULD HAVE A MEAN TEMPERATURE
1621-141599-0045 AT ABOUT THREE TIMES AS HIGH AS ON MARS PROVES
1621-141599-0046 AS HIGH AS THE FREEZING POINT OF WATER AND THIS PROOF IS SUPPORTED BY LANGLEY'S DETERMINATION OF THE LOW MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE OF THE FULL MOON THE COMBINATION OF THESE TWO RESULTS MUST BRING DOWN THE TEMPERATURE OF MARS
1621-141599-0047 TO A DEGREE WHOLLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE EXISTENCE OF ANIMAL LIFE THREE THE QUITE INDEPENDENT PROOF THAT WATER VAPOUR CANNOT EXIST ON MARS AND THAT THEREFORE THE FIRST ESSENTIAL OF ORGANIC LIFE WATER
1621-141599-0048 IS NON EXISTENT THE CONCLUSION FROM THESE THREE INDEPENDENT PROOFS WHICH ENFORCE EACH OTHER IN THE MULTIPLE RATIO OF THEIR RESPECTIVE WEIGHTS IS THEREFORE IRRESISTIBLE THAT ANIMAL LIFE
1621-141599-0049 ESPECIALLY IN ITS HIGHER FORMS CANNOT EXIST ON THE PLANET MARS THEREFORE IS NOT ONLY UNINHABITED BY INTELLIGENT BEINGS SUCH AS MISTER LOWELL POSTULATES BUT IS ABSOLUTELY
