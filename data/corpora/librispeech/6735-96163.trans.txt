6735-96163-0000 ONE DAY STANDING IN THAT WILD REGION OF BARE ROCK AND SEA CALLED CORNWALL POINT WHENCE ONE CAN SEE THE CRAGS AND POSTILLION WILD ROCKS WHERE LAND'S END DASHES OUT INTO THE SEA AND ALL THE WILD BLUE SEA BETWEEN
6735-96163-0001 AND NOT A HOUSE IN SIGHT SAVE THE CHIMNEY OF SOME LITTLE MILL LIKE PLACE PEEPING BETWEEN THE ROCKS INLAND ON THAT DAY I FINISHED WHAT I MAY CALL MY OFFICIAL SEARCH IN GOING AWAY FROM THAT PLACE WALKING NORTHWARD
6735-96163-0002 I CAME UPON A LONELY HOUSE BY THE SEA A VERY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE MADE IT WAS CLEAR BY AN ARTIST OF THE BUNGALOW TYPE WITH AN EXQUISITELY SEA SIDE EXPRESSION
6735-96163-0003 OR VERANDAH SHELTERED BY THE OVERHANGING UPPER STORY UP TO THE FIRST FLOOR THE EXTERIOR IS OF STONE IN ROUGH HEWN BLOCKS WITH A DISTINCT BATTER WHILE EXTRA PROTECTION FROM WEATHER IS AFFORDED BY GREEN SLATING ABOVE
6735-96163-0004 THE ROOFS OF LOW PITCH ARE ALSO COVERED WITH GREEN SLATES AND A FEELING OF STRENGTH AND REPOSE IS HEIGHTENED BY THE VERY LONG HORIZONTAL LINES AT ONE END OF THE LOGGIA IS A HEXAGONAL TURRET
6735-96163-0005 OPENING UPON THE LOGGIA CONTAINING A STUDY OR NOOK IN FRONT THE GARDEN SLOPES DOWN TO THE SEA SURROUNDED BY AN ARCHITECTURAL SEA WALL AND IN THIS PLACE I LIVED THREE WEEKS IT WAS THE HOUSE OF THE POET MACHEN
6735-96163-0006 WHOSE NAME WHEN I SAW IT I REMEMBERED VERY WELL AND HE HAD MARRIED A VERY BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL OF EIGHTEEN OBVIOUSLY SPANISH WHO LAY ON THE BED IN THE LARGE BRIGHT BEDROOM TO THE RIGHT OF THE LOGGIA
6735-96163-0007 ON HER LEFT EXPOSED BREAST BEING A BABY WITH AN INDIA RUBBER COMFORTER IN ITS MOUTH BOTH MOTHER AND CHILD WONDERFULLY PRESERVED SHE STILL QUITE LOVELY WHITE BROW UNDER LOW CURVES OF BLACK HAIR
6735-96163-0008 THE POET STRANGE TO SAY HAD NOT DIED WITH THEM BUT SAT IN THE SITTING ROOM BEHIND THE BEDROOM IN A LONG LOOSE SILKY GREY JACKET AT HIS DESK ACTUALLY WRITING A POEM WRITING I COULD SEE FURIOUSLY FAST
6735-96163-0009 AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN AS I KNEW THE CLOUD OVERTOOK THIS END OF CORNWALL AND STOPPED HIM AND PUT HIS HEAD TO REST ON THE DESK AND THE POOR LITTLE WIFE MUST HAVE GOT SLEEPY WAITING FOR IT TO COME PERHAPS SLEEPLESS FOR MANY LONG NIGHTS BEFORE
6735-96163-0010 AND GONE TO BED HE PERHAPS PROMISING TO FOLLOW IN A MINUTE TO DIE WITH HER BUT BENT UPON FINISHING THAT POEM AND WRITING FEVERISHLY ON RUNNING A RACE WITH THE CLOUD THINKING NO DOUBT JUST TWO COUPLETS MORE
6735-96163-0011 TILL THE THING CAME AND PUT HIS HEAD TO REST ON THE DESK POOR CARLE AND I DO NOT KNOW THAT I EVER ENCOUNTERED AUGHT SO COMPLIMENTARY TO MY RACE AS THIS DEAD POET MACHEN AND HIS RACE WITH THE CLOUD
6735-96163-0012 FOR IT IS CLEAR NOW THAT THE BETTER KIND OF THOSE POET MEN DID NOT WRITE TO PLEASE THE VAGUE INFERIOR TRIBES WHO MIGHT READ THEM BUT TO DELIVER THEMSELVES OF THE DIVINE WARMTH THAT THRONGED IN THEIR BOSOM
6735-96163-0013 AND IF ALL THE READERS WERE DEAD STILL THEY WOULD HAVE WRITTEN AND FOR GOD TO READ THEY WROTE AT ANY RATE I WAS SO PLEASED WITH THESE POOR PEOPLE THAT I STAYED WITH THEM THREE WEEKS SLEEPING UNDER BLANKETS ON A COUCH IN THE DRAWING ROOM
6735-96163-0014 A PLACE FULL OF LOVELY PICTURES AND FADED FLOWERS LIKE ALL THE HOUSE FOR I WOULD NOT TOUCH THE YOUNG MOTHER TO REMOVE HER AND FINDING ON MACHEN'S DESK A BIG NOTE BOOK WITH SOFT COVERS
6735-96163-0015 DAPPLED RED AND YELLOW NOT YET WRITTEN IN I TOOK IT AND A PENCIL AND IN THE LITTLE TURRET NOOK WROTE DAY AFTER DAY FOR HOURS THIS ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED NEARLY AS FAR AS IT HAS NOW GONE
6735-96163-0016 AND I THINK THAT I MAY CONTINUE TO WRITE IT FOR I FIND IN IT A STRANGE CONSOLATION AND COMPANIONSHIP IN THE SEVERN VALLEY SOMEWHERE IN THE PLAIN BETWEEN GLOUCESTER AND CHELTENHAM IN A RATHER LONELY SPOT
6735-96163-0017 I AT THAT TIME TRAVELLING ON A TRICYCLE MOTOR I SPIED A CURIOUS ERECTION AND WENT TO IT I FOUND IT OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE PERHAPS FIFTY FEET SQUARE AND THIRTY HIGH MADE OF PRESSED BRICKS
6735-96163-0018 THE PERFECTLY FLAT ROOF TOO OF BRICK AND NOT ONE WINDOW AND ONLY ONE DOOR THIS DOOR WHICH I FOUND OPEN WAS RIMMED ALL ROUND ITS SLANTING RIMS WITH INDIA RUBBER AND WHEN CLOSED MUST HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY AIR TIGHT
6735-96163-0019 JUST INSIDE I CAME UPON FIFTEEN ENGLISH PEOPLE OF THE DRESSED CLASS EXCEPT TWO WHO WERE EVIDENTLY BRICKLAYERS SIX LADIES AND NINE MEN AND AT THE FURTHER END TWO MORE MEN
6735-96163-0020 WHO HAD THEIR THROATS CUT ALONG ONE WALL FROM END TO END WERE PROVISIONS AND I SAW A CHEST FULL OF MIXED POTASSIC CHLORATE AND BLACK OXIDE OF MANGANESE WITH AN APPARATUS FOR HEATING IT AND PRODUCING OXYGEN
6735-96163-0021 A FOOLISH THING FOR ADDITIONAL OXYGEN COULD NOT ALTER THE QUANTITY OF BREATHED CARBONIC ANHYDRIDE WHICH IS A DIRECT NARCOTIC POISON WHETHER THE TWO WITH CUT THROATS HAD SACRIFICED THEMSELVES FOR THE OTHERS
6735-96163-0022 WHEN BREATHING DIFFICULTIES COMMENCED OR BEEN KILLED BY THE OTHERS WAS NOT CLEAR WHEN THEY COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER THEY MUST HAVE FINALLY OPENED THE DOOR HOPING THAT BY THEN AFTER THE PASSAGE OF MANY DAYS PERHAPS
6735-96163-0023 THE OUTER AIR WOULD BE HARMLESS AND SO MET THEIR DEATH I BELIEVE THAT THIS ERECTION MUST HAVE BEEN RUN UP BY THEIR OWN HANDS UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE TWO BRICKLAYERS FOR THEY COULD NOT I SUPPOSE HAVE GOT WORKMEN
6735-96163-0024 EXCEPT ON THE CONDITION OF THE WORKMEN'S ADMISSION ON WHICH CONDITION THEY WOULD NATURALLY EMPLOY AS FEW AS POSSIBLE IN GENERAL I REMARKED THAT THE RICH MUST HAVE BEEN MORE URGENT AND EARNEST IN SEEKING ESCAPE THAN THE OTHERS
6735-96163-0025 FOR THE POOR REALISED ONLY THE NEAR AND VISIBLE LIVED IN TO DAY AND CHERISHED THE ALWAYS FALSE NOTION THAT TO MORROW WOULD BE JUST LIKE TO DAY IN AN OUT PATIENTS WAITING ROOM FOR INSTANCE IN THE GLOUCESTER INFIRMARY
6735-96163-0026 I CHANCED TO SEE AN ASTONISHING THING FIVE BODIES OF POOR OLD WOMEN IN SHAWLS COME TO HAVE THEIR AILMENTS SEEN TO ON THE DAY OF DOOM
6735-96163-0027 AND THESE I CONCLUDED HAD BEEN UNABLE TO REALISE THAT ANYTHING WOULD REALLY HAPPEN TO THE DAILY OLD EARTH WHICH THEY KNEW AND HAD WALKED WITH ASSURANCE ON FOR IF EVERYBODY WAS TO DIE THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT
6735-96163-0028 WHO WOULD PREACH IN THE CATHEDRAL ON SUNDAY EVENINGS SO THEY COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IN AN ADJOINING ROOM SAT AN OLD DOCTOR AT A TABLE THE STETHOSCOPE TIPS STILL CLINGING IN HIS EARS
6735-96163-0029 A WOMAN WITH BARED CHEST BEFORE HIM AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WELL THIS OLD MAN TOO DIED DOING HIS WORK IN THIS SAME INFIRMARY THERE WAS ONE SURGICAL WARD
6735-96163-0030 NOR OF SUFFOCATION BUT OF HUNGER
6735-96163-0031 DOUBLE BOARDING THE WINDOWS FELTING THE DOORS AND THEN LOCKING THEM OUTSIDE THEY THEMSELVES MAY HAVE PERISHED BEFORE THEIR PRECAUTIONS FOR THE IMPRISONED PATIENTS WERE COMPLETE FOR I FOUND A HEAP OF MAIMED SHAPES
6735-96163-0032 MERE SKELETONS CROWDED ROUND THE DOOR WITHIN I KNEW VERY WELL THAT THEY HAD NOT DIED OF THE CLOUD POISON FOR THE PESTILENCE OF THE WARD WAS UNMIXED WITH THAT ODOUR OF PEACH WHICH DID NOT FAIL TO HAVE MORE OR LESS EMBALMING EFFECTS UPON THE BODIES
6735-96163-0033 WHICH IT SATURATED I RUSHED STIFLING FROM THAT PLACE AND THINKING IT A PITY AND A DANGER THAT SUCH A HORROR SHOULD BE I AT ONCE SET TO WORK TO GATHER COMBUSTIBLES TO BURN THE BUILDING TO THE GROUND
6735-96163-0034 IT WAS WHILE I SAT IN AN ARM CHAIR IN THE STREET THE NEXT AFTERNOON SMOKING AND WATCHING THE FLAMES OF THIS STRUCTURE THAT SOMETHING WAS SUDDENLY BORN IN ME SOMETHING FROM THE LOWEST HELL
6735-96163-0035 AND I SMILED A SMILE THAT NEVER YET MAN SMILED AND I SAID I WILL BURN I WILL BURN I WILL RETURN TO LONDON WHILE I WAS ON THIS EASTWARD JOURNEY STOPPING FOR THE NIGHT AT THE TOWN OF SWINDON
6735-96163-0036 I HAD A DREAM FOR I DREAMED THAT A LITTLE BROWN BALD OLD MAN WITH A BENT BACK WHOSE BEARD RAN IN ONE THIN STREAMLET OF SILVER FROM HIS CHIN TO TRAIL ALONG THE GROUND SAID TO ME
6735-96163-0037 YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE ALONE ON THE EARTH ITS SOLE DESPOT WELL HAVE YOUR FLING BUT AS SURE AS GOD LIVES AS GOD LIVES AS GOD LIVES' HE REPEATED IT SIX TIMES
6735-96163-0038 YOU WILL MEET ANOTHER AND I STARTED FROM THAT FRIGHTFUL SLEEP WITH THE BROW OF A CORPSE WET WITH SWEAT I RETURNED TO LONDON ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF MARCH ARRIVING WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF THE NORTHERN STATION
6735-96163-0039 ONE WINDY DARK EVENING ABOUT EIGHT WHERE I ALIGHTED AND WALKED TO EUSTON ROAD THEN EASTWARD ALONG IT TILL I CAME TO A SHOP WHICH I KNEW TO BE A JEWELLER'S THOUGH IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE ANY PAINTED WORDS THE DOOR TO MY ANNOYANCE WAS LOCKED
6735-96163-0040 LIKE NEARLY ALL THE SHOP DOORS IN LONDON I THEREFORE WENT LOOKING NEAR THE GROUND AND INTO A CART FOR SOMETHING HEAVY VERY SOON SAW A LABOURER'S PONDEROUS BOOTS CUT ONE FROM THE SHRIVELLED FOOT AND SET TO BEAT AT THE GLASS TILL IT CAME RAINING
6735-96163-0041 NO HORRORS NOW AT THAT CLATTER OF BROKEN GLASS NO SICK QUALMS MY PULSE STEADY MY HEAD HIGH MY STEP ROYAL MY EYE COLD AND CALM
6735-96163-0042 EIGHT MONTHS PREVIOUSLY I HAD LEFT LONDON A POOR BURDENED COWERING WIGHT I COULD SCREAM WITH LAUGHTER NOW AT THAT FOLLY BUT IT DID NOT LAST LONG I RETURNED TO IT THE SULTAN
6735-96163-0043 NO PRIVATE PALACE BEING NEAR I WAS GOING TO THAT GREAT HOTEL IN BLOOMSBURY BUT THOUGH I KNEW THAT NUMBERS OF CANDLE STICKS WOULD BE THERE I WAS NOT SURE THAT I SHOULD FIND SUFFICIENT
6735-96163-0044 FOR I HAD ACQUIRED THE HABIT WITHIN THE PAST FEW MONTHS OF SLEEPING WITH AT LEAST SIXTY LIGHTED ABOUT ME AND THEIR FORM PATTERN STYLE AGE AND MATERIAL WAS OF NO SMALL IMPORTANCE I SELECTED TEN FROM THE BROKEN SHOP
6735-96163-0045 EIGHT GOLD AND SILVER AND TWO OF OLD ECCLESIASTICAL BRASS AND HAVING MADE A BUNDLE WENT OUT FOUND A BICYCLE AT THE METROPOLITAN STATION PUMPED IT TIED MY BUNDLE TO THE HANDLE BAR AND SET OFF RIDING
6735-96163-0046 BUT SINCE I WAS TOO LAZY TO WALK I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE PROCURED SOME OTHER MEANS OF TRAVELLING FOR I HAD NOT GONE TEN JOLTED AND CREAKING YARDS WHEN SOMETHING WENT SNAP IT WAS A FRONT FORK AND I FOUND MYSELF HALF ON THE GROUND
6735-96163-0047 AND HALF ACROSS THE BARE KNEES OF A HIGHLAND SOLDIER I FLEW WITH A SHOWER OF KICKS UPON THE FOOLISH THING BUT THAT BOOTED NOTHING
