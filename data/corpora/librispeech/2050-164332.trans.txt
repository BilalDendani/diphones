2050-164332-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN I EXPECT THE ASSASSIN THIS EVENING I MUST TAKE YOU SAID ROULETABILLE SO AS TO ENABLE YOU TO UNDERSTAND TO THE VARIOUS SCENES I MYSELF BELIEVE THAT I HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS SEARCHING FOR
2050-164332-0001 NAMELY HOW THE MURDERER ESCAPED FROM THE YELLOW ROOM WITHOUT ANY ACCOMPLICE AND WITHOUT MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON HAVING HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT BUT SO LONG AS I AM NOT SURE OF THE REAL MURDERER I CANNOT STATE THE THEORY ON WHICH I AM WORKING
2050-164332-0002 AS TO WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS PLACE THREE NIGHTS AGO
2050-164332-0003 IT PASSES ALL BELIEF THE THEORY I HAVE FORMED FROM THE INCIDENT IS SO ABSURD THAT I WOULD RATHER MATTERS REMAINED AS YET UNEXPLAINED
2050-164332-0004 THE ONLY SOUND TO BE HEARD WAS THE CRUNCHING OF THE DEAD LEAVES BENEATH OUR FEET THE SILENCE WAS SO INTENSE THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THE CHATEAU HAD BEEN ABANDONED
2050-164332-0005 THE OLD STONES THE STAGNANT WATER OF THE DITCH SURROUNDING THE DONJON THE BLEAK GROUND STREWN WITH THE DEAD LEAVES THE DARK SKELETON LIKE OUTLINES OF THE TREES ALL CONTRIBUTED TO GIVE TO THE DESOLATE PLACE NOW FILLED WITH ITS AWFUL MYSTERY
2050-164332-0006 A MOST FUNEREAL ASPECT AS WE PASSED ROUND THE DONJON WE MET THE GREEN MAN THE FOREST KEEPER WHO DID NOT GREET US BUT WALKED BY AS IF WE HAD NOT EXISTED HE WAS LOOKING JUST AS I HAD FORMERLY SEEN HIM THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE DONJON INN
2050-164332-0007 HE HAD STILL HIS FOWLING PIECE SLUNG AT HIS BACK HIS PIPE WAS IN HIS MOUTH AND HIS EYE GLASSES ON HIS NOSE AN ODD KIND OF FISH ROULETABILLE SAID TO ME IN A LOW TONE HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO HIM I ASKED YES BUT
2050-164332-0008 I COULD GET NOTHING OUT OF HIM HIS ONLY ANSWERS ARE GRUNTS AND SHRUGS OF THE SHOULDERS HE GENERALLY LIVES ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE DONJON A BIG ROOM THAT ONCE SERVED FOR AN ORATORY HE LIVES LIKE A BEAR NEVER GOES OUT WITHOUT HIS GUN AND IS ONLY PLEASANT WITH THE GIRLS
2050-164332-0009 THE WOMEN FOR TWELVE MILES ROUND ARE ALL SETTING THEIR CAPS FOR HIM FOR THE PRESENT HE IS PAYING ATTENTION TO MADAME MATHIEU WHOSE HUSBAND IS KEEPING A LYNX EYE UPON HER IN CONSEQUENCE
2050-164332-0010 AFTER PASSING THE DONJON WHICH IS SITUATED AT THE EXTREME END OF THE LEFT WING WE WENT TO THE BACK OF THE CHATEAU ROULETABILLE POINTING TO A WINDOW WHICH I RECOGNISED AS THE ONLY ONE BELONGING TO MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S APARTMENT SAID TO ME
2050-164332-0011 ABOUT TO ENTER THE CHATEAU BY THAT WINDOW AS I EXPRESSED SOME SURPRISE AT THIS PIECE OF NOCTURNAL GYMNASTICS
2050-164332-0012 THIS GALLERY HIGH AND WIDE EXTENDED ALONG THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE BUILDING AND WAS LIT FROM THE FRONT OF THE CHATEAU FACING THE NORTH THE ROOMS THE WINDOWS OF WHICH LOOKED TO THE SOUTH OPENED OUT OF THE GALLERY
2050-164332-0013 PROFESSOR STANGERSON INHABITED THE LEFT WING OF THE BUILDING MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON HAD HER APARTMENT IN THE RIGHT WING WE ENTERED THE GALLERY TO THE RIGHT A NARROW CARPET LAID ON THE WAXED OAKEN FLOOR WHICH SHONE LIKE GLASS DEADENED THE SOUND OF OUR FOOTSTEPS
2050-164332-0014 HE SEIZED THEM EAGERLY HIS FINGERS CARESSING THE GLASS THEN LOOKING AT ME WITH AN EXPRESSION OF TERROR ON HIS FACE HE MURMURED OH OH HE REPEATED THE EXCLAMATION AGAIN AND AGAIN AS IF HIS THOUGHTS HAD SUDDENLY TURNED HIS BRAIN
2050-164332-0015 ROULETABILLE OPENED IT A FIGURE ENTERED
2050-164332-0016 I WAS SURPRISED THINKING SHE WAS STILL UNDER LOCK AND KEY THIS WOMAN SAID IN A VERY LOW TONE IN THE GROVE OF THE PARQUET ROULETABILLE REPLIED THANKS THE WOMAN THEN LEFT HE AGAIN TURNED TO ME HIS LOOK HAGGARD
2050-164332-0017 IF THE THING IS MATHEMATICALLY POSSIBLE WHY SHOULD IT NOT BE HUMANLY AND IF IT IS HUMANLY POSSIBLE THE MATTER IS SIMPLY AWFUL I INTERRUPTED HIM IN HIS SOLILOQUY
2050-164332-0018 I ASKED YES HE REPLIED I HAD THEM LIBERATED I NEEDED PEOPLE I COULD TRUST THE WOMAN IS THOROUGHLY DEVOTED TO ME AND HER HUSBAND WOULD LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR ME OHO I SAID WHEN WILL HE HAVE OCCASION TO DO IT
2050-164332-0019 THIS EVENING FOR THIS EVENING I EXPECT THE MURDERER YOU EXPECT THE MURDERER THIS EVENING THEN YOU KNOW HIM I SHALL KNOW HIM BUT I SHOULD BE MAD TO AFFIRM CATEGORICALLY AT THIS MOMENT THAT I DO KNOW HIM
2050-164332-0020 THE MATHEMATICAL IDEA I HAVE OF THE MURDERER GIVES RESULTS SO FRIGHTFUL
2050-164332-0021 I HOPE SO WITH ALL MY HEART
2050-164332-0022 BECAUSE I KNOW THAT HE MUST COME ROULETABILLE VERY SLOWLY FILLED HIS PIPE AND LIT IT THAT MEANT AN INTERESTING STORY AT THAT MOMENT WE HEARD SOME ONE WALKING IN THE GALLERY AND PASSING BEFORE OUR DOOR ROULETABILLE LISTENED
2050-164332-0023 IS FREDERIC LARSAN IN HIS ROOM I ASKED POINTING TO THE PARTITION NO MY FRIEND ANSWERED HE WENT TO PARIS THIS MORNING STILL ON THE SCENT OF DARZAC WHO ALSO LEFT FOR PARIS THAT MATTER WILL TURN OUT BADLY
2050-164332-0024 I EXPECT THAT MONSIEUR DARZAC WILL BE ARRESTED IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT WEEK
2050-164332-0025 CIRCUMSTANCES THINGS PEOPLE NOT AN HOUR PASSES WITHOUT BRINGING SOME NEW EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM THE EXAMINING MAGISTRATE IS OVERWHELMED BY IT AND BLIND FREDERIC LARSAN HOWEVER IS NOT A NOVICE I SAID I THOUGHT SO
2050-164332-0026 SAID ROULETABILLE WITH A SLIGHTLY CONTEMPTUOUS TURN OF HIS LIPS I FANCIED HE WAS A MUCH ABLER MAN I HAD INDEED A GREAT ADMIRATION FOR HIM BEFORE I GOT TO KNOW HIS METHOD OF WORKING IT'S DEPLORABLE HE OWES HIS REPUTATION SOLELY TO HIS ABILITY
2050-164332-0027 BUT HE LACKS REASONING POWER THE MATHEMATICS OF HIS IDEAS ARE VERY POOR I LOOKED CLOSELY AT ROULETABILLE AND COULD NOT HELP SMILING ON HEARING THIS BOY OF EIGHTEEN TALKING OF A MAN WHO HAD PROVED TO THE WORLD THAT HE WAS THE FINEST POLICE SLEUTH IN EUROPE YOU SMILE
2050-164332-0028 BUT I MUST MAKE HASTE ABOUT IT FOR HE HAS AN ENORMOUS START ON ME GIVEN HIM BY MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC WHO IS THIS EVENING GOING TO INCREASE IT STILL MORE
2050-164332-0029 EVERY TIME THE MURDERER COMES TO THE CHATEAU MONSIEUR DARZAC BY A STRANGE FATALITY ABSENTS HIMSELF AND REFUSES TO GIVE ANY ACCOUNT OF HOW HE EMPLOYS HIS TIME EVERY TIME THE ASSASSIN COMES TO THE CHATEAU I CRIED
2050-164332-0030 HAS HE RETURNED THEN YES DURING THAT FAMOUS NIGHT WHEN THE STRANGE PHENOMENON OCCURRED
2050-164332-0031 BUT I HAD LEARNED NEVER TO PRESS ROULETABILLE IN HIS NARRATIVES HE SPOKE WHEN THE FANCY TOOK HIM AND WHEN HE JUDGED IT TO BE RIGHT HE WAS LESS CONCERNED ABOUT MY CURIOSITY THAN HE WAS FOR MAKING A COMPLETE SUMMING UP FOR HIMSELF OF ANY IMPORTANT MATTER IN WHICH HE WAS INTERESTED
2050-164332-0032 INDEED THE RESULTS OF THAT STILL UNKNOWN SCIENCE KNOWN AS HYPNOTISM FOR EXAMPLE WERE NOT MORE INEXPLICABLE THAN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MATTER OF THE MURDERER AT THE MOMENT WHEN FOUR PERSONS WERE WITHIN TOUCH OF HIM I SPEAK OF HYPNOTISM AS I WOULD OF ELECTRICITY
2050-164332-0033 FOR OF THE NATURE OF BOTH WE ARE IGNORANT AND WE KNOW LITTLE OF THEIR LAWS I CITE THESE EXAMPLES BECAUSE AT THE TIME THE CASE APPEARED TO ME TO BE ONLY EXPLICABLE BY THE INEXPLICABLE THAT IS TO SAY BY AN EVENT OUTSIDE OF KNOWN NATURAL LAWS
2050-164332-0034 FOR THE MOST CURIOUS THING ABOUT ALL THE MYSTERIES OF THE GLANDIER CASE
2050-164332-0035 I HAVE AMONG THE PAPERS THAT WERE SENT ME BY THE YOUNG MAN AFTER THE AFFAIR WAS OVER A NOTE BOOK OF HIS IN WHICH A COMPLETE ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE PHENOMENON OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MATTER OF THE ASSASSIN AND THE THOUGHTS TO WHICH IT GAVE RISE IN THE MIND OF MY YOUNG FRIEND
