4973-24515-0000 THE OLD CAPITAL OF GREECE MUCH OF THE ANCIENT SPLENDOUR AND POWER OF THE GREEK PEOPLE HAD PASSED AWAY FOR THE ROMANS HAD CONQUERED THEIR COUNTRY AND THEY WERE NO LONGER A FREE NATION YET ALTHOUGH THE GREEKS HAD BEEN FORCED TO YIELD TO ROME
4973-24515-0001 THEIR CONQUERORS KNEW THAT THE GRECIAN SCHOLARS AND ARTISTS WERE FAR BETTER EDUCATED AND MORE HIGHLY GIFTED THAN THEMSELVES AND GREEK STATUES AND WRITINGS HAD THEREFORE BECOME THE FASHION THROUGHOUT THE ROMAN EMPIRE INDEED MANY OF THE GREEK SCULPTORS AND AUTHORS
4973-24515-0002 ARE REMEMBERED AND ADMIRED TO THIS DAY HOMER THE GREATEST GREEK POET WHO LIVED ABOUT A THOUSAND YEARS B C IS STILL WORLD FAMOUS
4973-24515-0003 AND UNJUST THAN THE WORST MEN AND WOMEN OF HIS TIME ACCORDING TO HIS IDEAS JUPITER DIANA APOLLO MARS AND THE REST CAME DOWN TO EARTH AND TOOK PART IN THE BATTLE IN VAIN DID THE GREAT HERO HECTOR
4973-24515-0004 FIGHT HIS BRAVEST IN VAIN DID HE SACRIFICE HIMSELF AND STRIVE TO MAKE UP FOR THE WRONG DOING OF HIS BROTHER HE FAILED UTTERLY FOR HOMER TELLS US THAT HE WAS HATED BY SOME OF THE GODS FOR NO FAULT OF HIS OWN AND SO THEY DOOMED HIM TO DESTRUCTION
4973-24515-0005 THE WAR AGAINST SIN AND THE DEVIL AND THE NAME OF THIS SECOND BOOK IS THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES IN ALL THIS WONDERFUL BIBLE OF OURS THERE IS NO BOOK MORE WONDERFUL THAN THE BOOK OF THE ACTS
4973-24515-0006 HAVE YOU EVER STOPPED TO THINK WHAT A TERRIBLE GAP THERE WOULD BE IN THE HISTORY OF GOD'S DEALINGS WITH THE WORLD HAD THE ACTS NEVER BEEN WRITTEN THE APOSTLE PAUL'S LIFE WOULD BE ALMOST A BLANK STEPHEN'S VICTORIOUS DEATH WOULD BE ALL UNKNOWN TO US
4973-24515-0007 ABOVE ALL THE STORY OF OUR SAVIOUR'S ASCENSION INTO HEAVEN AND THE MARVELLOUS FULFILMENT OF HIS PROMISES IN THE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT AT PENTECOST WOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT UNTOLD THE BOOK OF THE ACTS STANDS ALONE THERE ARE FOUR GOSPELS
4973-24515-0008 WRITTEN FROM FOUR DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW BUT OF THE FOUR WRITERS LUKE THE GREEK
4973-24515-0009 AND SHOWED THE RESULTS WHICH OUR SAVIOUR'S LIFE AND DEATH AND RESURRECTION PRODUCED AT ONCE IN THE WORLD THE MARVELLOUS ACCURACY OF SAINT LUKE AND HIS KEEN OBSERVATION BECOME EVERY YEAR MORE STRIKING AS FRESH DISCOVERIES IN THE LANDS OF WHICH HE WROTE
4973-24515-0010 SHOW HOW TRUE HE IS IN THE TINIEST DETAIL
4973-24515-0011 HOW DID LUKE WRITE AND WHAT DID HIS TWO BOOKS LOOK LIKE WHEN HE HAD FINISHED THEM HE WROTE ON PAPYRUS THAT IS ON REED PAPER USING AN INK LIKE BLACK PAINT AND A REED PEN AS FAR AS WE KNOW
4973-24515-0012 NO PORTIONS OF THE BIBLE BOOKS OF THIS DATE ARE LEFT IN THE WORLD BUT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR NINETEEN ELEVEN A LARGE NUMBER OF VERY ANCIENT FRAGMENTS OF BIBLE BOOKS WERE DISCOVERED IN UPPER EGYPT AND WITH THESE WAS PART OF A TRANSLATION OF LUKE'S BOOK OF THE ACTS
4973-24515-0013 JUST SHREDS AND TATTERS OF FRAGILE PAPYRUS PAPER THE REMAINS OF WHAT IS UP TILL NOW THE OLDEST COPY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT IN THE WORLD AMONGST THE ANCIENT MANUSCRIPTS KEPT IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM ARE OLD OLD COPIES OF HOMER'S WAR POEMS
4973-24515-0014 AND HERE ALSO ARE STORED THE PRECIOUS FRAGMENTS OF THE CHRONICLES OF THAT OTHER GREAT GREEK WRITER SAINT LUKE HOMER'S BOOK BELONGS TO THE FORGOTTEN PAST FOR THE HEATHEN RELIGION OF GREECE IS TO DAY AS THOUGH IT HAD NEVER BEEN
4973-24515-0015 BUT THE WRITINGS OF SAINT LUKE ARE AS FULL OF BLESSING AND POWER AS EVER AND THE WAR HE WROTE ABOUT GROWS MORE WONDERFUL EVERY DAY FOR CHRIST THE SON OF GOD CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN NOT TO FIGHT AGAINST MEN
4973-24515-0016 BUT TO FIGHT AND CONQUER FOR MEN TO LIFT UP THE FALLEN AND TO WIN FOR THE VICTORS A CROWN OF DEATHLESS GLORY THE APOSTLE PETER IN CONTRAST TO SAINT LUKE WAS ONLY A FISHERMAN WHEN THE LORD BADE HIM LEAVE HIS BOAT AND HIS NETS TO PREACH AND TEACH THE GOSPEL
4973-24515-0017 HIS IDEAS WERE VERY LIMITED WHEN JESUS CHRIST FIRST CAME INTO HIS LIFE
4973-24515-0018 BUT THE FISHERMAN WAS TO RECEIVE HIS EDUCATION IN A VERY DIFFERENT FASHION FROM LUKE
4973-24515-0019 NOT ONLY DID THE APOSTLE PETER WRITE A PART OF THE BIBLE BUT THAT SHORT BOOK KNOWN AS THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER IS ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY MENTIONED BY ALL THE EARLIEST CHRISTIAN WRITERS THOSE AUTHORS AND TEACHERS WHO HAD SEEN THE APOSTLES AND HAD HEARD FROM THEIR LIPS
4973-24515-0020 THE STORY OF THE SAVIOUR'S LIFE ON EARTH THUS IT IS THAT PETER'S CONTRIBUTION TO OUR BIBLE HAS BECOME ONE OF THE STRONGEST WITNESSES TO THE TRUTH OF THE WORDS WRITTEN DOWN IN THE GOSPELS THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF A MISTAKE
4973-24515-0021 THE MAN WHO WROTE THIS EPISTLE COULD HAVE BEEN NONE OTHER THAN THE APOSTLE PETER WHO HAD BEEN WITH THE LORD FROM THE BEGINNING OF HIS PUBLIC WORK AND IT IS VERY BEAUTIFUL TO TRACE THROUGHOUT PETER'S WRITINGS THE ECHOES
4973-24515-0022 CHRIST HAD GIVEN HIM HIS NAME PETER
4973-24515-0023 THAT IS A ROCK OR STONE AND SO HE WROTE OF HIS MASTER AS THE GREAT CORNER STONE OF GOD'S SPIRITUAL HOUSE IN WHICH EACH ONE OF CHRIST'S PEOPLE ARE LIVING STONES
4973-24515-0024 THE SAVIOUR HAD ONCE TOLD PETER THAT HE MUST FORGIVE HIS BROTHER ALTHOUGH HE WAS WRONGED BY HIM ON SEVENTY TIMES SEVEN OCCASIONS
4973-24515-0025 WE READ ABOVE ALL THINGS HAVE FERVENT CHARITY AMONG YOURSELVES FOR CHARITY SHALL COVER THE MULTITUDE OF SINS
4973-24515-0026 EIGHT CHARITY SHOULD HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED LOVE THEN THE LORD HAD WARNED PETER THAT SATAN HAD DESIRED TO HAVE HIM AND HE REMEMBERING THAT SOLEMN FACT IN HIS OWN LIFE TRIED TO PUT HIS READERS ON THEIR GUARD AGAINST THE GREAT ENEMY
4973-24515-0027 BECAUSE YOUR ADVERSARY THE DEVIL AS A ROARING LION WALKETH ABOUT SEEKING WHOM HE MAY DEVOUR
4973-24515-0028 MOST TOUCHING OF ALL ARE THE WORDS HE WROTE
4973-24515-0029 IF WHEN YE BE BUFFETED FOR YOUR FAULTS YE SHALL TAKE IT PATIENTLY BUT IF WHEN YE DO WELL AND SUFFER FOR IT YE TAKE IT PATIENTLY THIS IS ACCEPTABLE WITH GOD BECAUSE CHRIST ALSO SUFFERED FOR US LEAVING US AN EXAMPLE
4973-24515-0030 HIS MASTER'S LAST COMMAND BY THE LAKE OF GALILEE TO FEED HIS FLOCK WAS SO DEEPLY IMPRESSED ON PETER'S MIND THAT IT COLOURED ALL HIS THOUGHTS TO THE LAST DAY OF HIS LIFE
4973-24515-0031 WE BELIEVE TO COMFORT GOD'S PEOPLE UNDER THE HEAVY TRIAL OF PAUL'S SECOND IMPRISONMENT CRUELTY AND PERSECUTION WERE DOING THEIR WORST BUT GOD WAS ABOVE ALL BELOVED THINK IT NOT STRANGE CONCERNING THE FIERY TRIAL WHICH IS TO TRY YOU
4973-24515-0032 BUT REJOICE INASMUCH AS YE ARE PARTAKERS OF CHRIST'S SUFFERINGS
4973-24515-0033 TWO SHORT BUT VERY BEAUTIFUL EPISTLES ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY TWO OF THE LORD'S BRETHREN SAINT JAMES AND SAINT JUDE
4973-24515-0034 DIED THREE HUNDRED FORTY TELLS US THAT JAMES WAS A NAZARITE
4973-24515-0035 HE ATE NO MEAT DRANK NO WINE AND WORE NOTHING BUT WHITE LINEN GARMENTS THIS VOW IS OFTEN MENTIONED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT JAMES HAD NOT BELIEVED THAT JESUS CHRIST WAS THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD UNTIL AFTER HIS RESURRECTION WHEN THE LORD APPEARED TO HIM
4973-24515-0036 AFTER THAT HE WAS SEEN OF JAMES
4973-24515-0037 THIS SET HIS DOUBTS AT REST FOR EVER
4973-24515-0038 THESE WRITERS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT AS THEY TOOK THEIR REED PENS IN THEIR HANDS AND SPREAD OUT THEIR ROLLS OF WHITEY BROWN PAPYRUS PAPER WERE NOT LIKE MOSES
4973-24515-0039 HE STILL LIVED ON SPEAKING AND WRITING OF HIS MASTER AND TO THE APOSTLE JOHN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST ENTRUSTED THE RECORD OF MANY OF HIS MOST BEAUTIFUL AND COMFORTING WORDS AND OF THE DEEPEST AND MOST SPIRITUAL TEACHING IN THE WHOLE BIBLE
4973-24515-0040 THREE OF THE SHORTEST AND YET MOST BEAUTIFUL BOOKS OF THE BIBLE ARE THE THREE EPISTLES WHICH BEAR JOHN'S NAME
4973-24515-0041 IN JOHN'S LATTER DAYS AND EVERY SENTENCE IN THEM SEEMS TO BREATHE FORTH THE PEACE LOVE AND WISDOM OF A VERY OLD MAN WHO HAS LIVED CLOSE TO CHRIST FOR MANY YEARS IT MAY WELL BE THEN THAT THESE CALM AND LOVING LETTERS WERE THE LAST OF ALL THE BIBLE WORDS TO BE WRITTEN
4973-24515-0042 NOW THE REVELATION THOUGH PLACED AT THE END OF OUR BIBLE WAS NOT THE LAST BOOK TO BE WRITTEN IT WAS PROBABLY COMPOSED WHILST NERO THE WICKED EMPEROR WAS TORTURING AND BURNING THE FOLLOWERS OF CHRIST
4973-24515-0043 BUT THE HOLY SPIRIT COMFORTED HIM AND LIFTED HIS THOUGHTS RIGHT UP TO HEAVEN SHOWING HIM IN A VISION THE END OF ALL THESE THINGS AMONG THE FRAGMENTS OF THE OLDEST BIBLES IN THE WORLD RECENTLY DISCOVERED THE BOOK OF REVELATION TAKES A PROMINENT PLACE
4973-24515-0044 LET US REMEMBER WHEN WE LOOK ON THE FADED PAGES LYING IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM THAT WHEN THEIR DISCOLOURED LINES WERE FRESH AND CLEAN
