1646-121406-0021 BUT MY LORD TELL ME SHE CONTINUED HIDE NOTHING FROM ME WHAT IS IN TRUTH THE KING'S POSITION IS IT AS HOPELESS AS HE THINKS ALAS MADAME MORE HOPELESS THAN HE THINKS HIS MAJESTY HAS SO GOOD A HEART THAT HE CANNOT UNDERSTAND HATRED
1646-121406-0022 IS SO LOYAL THAT HE DOES NOT SUSPECT TREASON ENGLAND IS TORN IN TWAIN BY A SPIRIT OF DISTURBANCE WHICH I GREATLY FEAR BLOOD ALONE CAN EXORCISE BUT LORD MONTROSE REPLIED THE QUEEN I HAVE HEARD OF HIS GREAT AND RAPID SUCCESSES OF BATTLES GAINED
1646-121406-0023 I HEARD IT SAID THAT HE WAS MARCHING TO THE FRONTIER TO JOIN THE KING YES MADAME BUT ON THE FRONTIER HE WAS MET BY LESLY HE HAD TRIED VICTORY BY MEANS OF SUPERHUMAN UNDERTAKINGS NOW VICTORY HAS ABANDONED HIM MONTROSE BEATEN AT PHILIPHAUGH
1646-121406-0024 WAS OBLIGED TO DISPERSE THE REMAINS OF HIS ARMY AND TO FLY DISGUISED AS A SERVANT HE IS AT BERGEN IN NORWAY HEAVEN PRESERVE HIM SAID THE QUEEN IT IS AT LEAST A CONSOLATION TO KNOW THAT SOME WHO HAVE SO OFTEN RISKED THEIR LIVES FOR US ARE SAFE
1646-121406-0025 AND NOW MY LORD THAT I SEE HOW HOPELESS THE POSITION OF THE KING IS TELL ME WITH WHAT YOU ARE CHARGED ON THE PART OF MY ROYAL HUSBAND WELL THEN MADAME SAID DE WINTER THE KING WISHES YOU TO TRY AND DISCOVER THE DISPOSITIONS OF THE KING AND QUEEN TOWARD HIM
1646-121406-0026 ALAS YOU KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE KING IS BUT A CHILD AND THE QUEEN A WOMAN WEAK ENOUGH HERE MONSIEUR MAZARIN IS EVERYTHING DOES HE DESIRE TO PLAY THE PART IN FRANCE THAT CROMWELL PLAYS IN ENGLAND
1646-121406-0027 OH NO HE IS A SUBTLE CONSCIENCELESS ITALIAN WHO THOUGH HE VERY LIKELY DREAMS OF CRIME DARES NOT COMMIT IT AND UNLIKE CROMWELL WHO DISPOSES OF BOTH HOUSES MAZARIN HAS HAD THE QUEEN TO SUPPORT HIM IN HIS STRUGGLE WITH THE PARLIAMENT
1646-121406-0028 MORE REASON THEN HE SHOULD PROTECT A KING PURSUED BY PARLIAMENT THE QUEEN SHOOK HER HEAD DESPAIRINGLY IF I JUDGE FOR MYSELF MY LORD SHE SAID THE CARDINAL WILL DO NOTHING AND WILL EVEN PERHAPS ACT AGAINST US
1646-121406-0029 MUCH MORE SO WOULD BE THAT OF THE KING MY LORD ADDED HENRIETTA WITH A MELANCHOLY SMILE IT IS SAD AND ALMOST SHAMEFUL TO BE OBLIGED TO SAY THAT WE HAVE PASSED THE WINTER IN THE LOUVRE WITHOUT MONEY WITHOUT LINEN ALMOST WITHOUT BREAD AND OFTEN NOT RISING FROM BED BECAUSE WE WANTED FIRE
1646-121406-0030 WHEREFORE DID YOU NOT APPLY THEN MADAME TO THE FIRST PERSON YOU SAW FROM US SUCH IS THE HOSPITALITY SHOWN TO A QUEEN BY THE MINISTER FROM WHOM A KING DEMANDS IT BUT I HEARD THAT A MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE PRINCE OF WALES AND MADEMOISELLE D'ORLEANS WAS SPOKEN OF SAID DE WINTER
1646-121406-0031 YES FOR AN INSTANT I HOPED IT WAS SO THE YOUNG PEOPLE FELT A MUTUAL ESTEEM BUT THE QUEEN WHO AT FIRST SANCTIONED THEIR AFFECTION CHANGED HER MIND
1646-121406-0032 OH MY LORD CONTINUED THE QUEEN WITHOUT RESTRAINING HER TEARS IT IS BETTER TO FIGHT AS THE KING HAS DONE AND TO DIE AS PERHAPS HE WILL THAN LIVE IN BEGGARY LIKE ME COURAGE MADAME COURAGE DO NOT DESPAIR
1646-121406-0033 THE INTERESTS OF THE FRENCH CROWN ENDANGERED AT THIS MOMENT ARE TO DISCOUNTENANCE REBELLION IN A NEIGHBORING NATION MAZARIN AS A STATESMAN WILL UNDERSTAND THE POLITIC NECESSITY ARE YOU SURE SAID THE QUEEN DOUBTFULLY THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN FORESTALLED
1646-121406-0034 BY WHOM BY THE JOICES THE PRINNS THE CROMWELLS BY A TAILOR A COACHMAKER A BREWER AH I HOPE MADAME THAT THE CARDINAL WILL NOT ENTER INTO NEGOTIATIONS WITH SUCH MEN AH WHAT IS HE HIMSELF ASKED MADAME HENRIETTA
1646-121406-0035 BUT FOR THE HONOR OF THE KING OF THE QUEEN WELL LET US HOPE HE WILL DO SOMETHING FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR HONOR SAID THE QUEEN A TRUE FRIEND'S ELOQUENCE IS SO POWERFUL MY LORD THAT YOU HAVE REASSURED ME GIVE ME YOUR HAND AND LET US GO TO THE MINISTER AND YET SHE ADDED
1646-121406-0036 SUPPOSE HE SHOULD REFUSE AND THAT THE KING LOSES THE BATTLE HIS MAJESTY WILL THEN TAKE REFUGE IN HOLLAND WHERE I HEAR HIS HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES NOW IS AND CAN HIS MAJESTY COUNT UPON MANY SUCH SUBJECTS AS YOURSELF FOR HIS FLIGHT ALAS NO MADAME
1646-121406-0037 ALLIES SAID THE QUEEN SHAKING HER HEAD
