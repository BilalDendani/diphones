5570-73846-0000 DOCTOR SIMON HAD COME AND GONE OPTIMISTIC AND URBANE
5570-73846-0001 OVER A PATIENT BEHIND WHOSE TACITURNITY A HINT OF MOCKERY AND SUBTERFUGE SEEMED TO LURK EVEN MISSUS LAWFORD HAD APPEARED TO SHARE HER HUSBAND'S RETICENCE BUT DOCTOR SIMON HAD HAPPENED ON OTHER CASES IN HIS EXPERIENCE
5570-73846-0002 HAD FLOATED UP TO THE PATIENT'S OPEN WINDOW SUNLIGHT HAD DRAWN ACROSS HIS ROOM IN ONE PALE BEAM AND VANISHED A FEW CALLERS HAD CALLED HOTHOUSE FLOWERS WAXEN AND PALE HAD BEEN LEFT WITH MESSAGES OF SYMPATHY
5570-73846-0003 WITH HIS FACE TO THE CEILING HE HAD DOZED AND HAD AWAKENED COLD AND TORPID WITH DREAM HE HAD HARDLY BEEN AWARE OF THE PROCESS BUT EVERY HOUR HAD DONE SOMETHING IT SEEMED TOWARDS CLARIFYING HIS POINT OF VIEW
5570-73846-0004 A CONSCIOUSNESS HAD BEGUN TO STIR IN HIM THAT WAS NEITHER THAT OF THE OLD EASY LAWFORD WHOM HE HAD NEVER BEEN FULLY AWARE OF BEFORE NOR OF THIS STRANGE GHOSTLY INTELLIGENCE THAT HAUNTED THE HAWKLIKE RESTLESS FACE
5570-73846-0005 AND PLUCKED SO INSISTENTLY AT HIS DISTRACTED NERVES HE HAD BEGUN IN A VAGUE FASHION TO BE AWARE OF THEM BOTH COULD IN A FASHION DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN THEM ALMOST AS IF THERE REALLY WERE TWO SPIRITS IN STUBBORN CONFLICT WITHIN HIM
5570-73846-0006 IT WOULD OF COURSE WEAR HIM DOWN IN TIME THERE COULD BE ONLY ONE END TO SUCH A STRUGGLE THE END ALL DAY HE HAD LONGED FOR FREEDOM ON AND ON WITH CRAVING FOR THE OPEN SKY
5570-73846-0007 FOR SOLITUDE FOR GREEN SILENCE BEYOND THESE MADDENING WALLS THIS HEEDFUL SILKEN COMING AND GOING THESE SUNDAY VOICES THIS REITERANT YELP OF A SINGLE PEEVISH BELL WOULD THEY NEVER CEASE
5570-73846-0008 AND ABOVE ALL BETWIXT DREAD AND AN ALMOST PHYSICAL GREED HE HUNGERED FOR NIGHT HE SAT DOWN WITH ELBOWS ON KNEES AND HEAD ON HIS HANDS THINKING OF NIGHT ITS SECRECY
5570-73846-0009 HE STARTED UP AND THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE MORNING RETURNED TO HIM THE GLASSY LIGHT THE CHANGING RAYS THE BEAMING GILT UPON THE USELESS BOOKS NOW AT LAST AT THE WINDOWS AFTERNOON HAD BEGUN TO WANE
5570-73846-0010 YOU REALLY MUST TRY TO THINK OF OF US ALL ARE YOU GOING TO CHURCH HE ASKED IN A LOW VOICE
5570-73846-0011 BUT DOCTOR SIMON ADVISED ME MOST PARTICULARLY TO GO OUT AT LEAST ONCE A DAY WE MUST REMEMBER THIS IS NOT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR ILLNESS LONG CONTINUED ANXIETY I SUPPOSE DOES TELL ON ONE IN TIME ANYHOW HE SAID THAT I LOOKED WORRIED AND RUN DOWN
5570-73846-0012 I AM WORRIED LET US BOTH TRY FOR EACH OTHER'S SAKES OR EVEN IF ONLY FOR ALICE'S TO TO DO ALL WE CAN I MUST NOT HARASS YOU BUT IS THERE ANY DO YOU SEE THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE OF ANY KIND
5570-73846-0013 SHEILA LOWERED HER EYES SOFTLY ON TO THE RICH TONED PICTURE IN THE GLASS SUPPOSING SHE SAID WATCHING HER LIPS MOVE SUPPOSING
5570-73846-0014 WHAT WILL YOU DO HONESTLY ARTHUR WHEN I THINK OVER IT CALMLY THE WHOLE TRAGEDY COMES BACK ON ME WITH SUCH A FORCE IT SWEEPS ME OFF MY FEET I AM FOR THE MOMENT SCARCELY MY OWN MISTRESS WHAT WOULD YOU DO
5570-73846-0015 SHE WATCHED HIM CURIOUSLY IN SPITE OF ALL HER REASON OF HER ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY SHE WONDERED EVEN AGAIN FOR A MOMENT IF THIS REALLY COULD BE ARTHUR AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE REALISED THE POWER AND MASTERY OF THAT EAGER
5570-73846-0016 AND FAR TOO HUNGRY FACE HER MIND SEEMED TO PAUSE FLUTTERING IN AIR LIKE A BIRD IN THE WIND SHE HASTENED RATHER UNSTEADILY TO THE DOOR
5570-73846-0017 SHE ASKED HER HUSBAND LOOKED UP OVER HIS LITTLE TABLE IS ALICE GOING WITH YOU OH YES POOR CHILD SHE LOOKS SO PALE AND MISERABLE WE ARE GOING TO MISSUS SHERWIN'S AND THEN ON TO CHURCH YOU WILL LOCK YOUR DOOR YES
5570-73846-0018 I WILL LOCK MY DOOR AND I DO HOPE ARTHUR NOTHING RASH A CHANGE THAT SEEMED ALMOST THE EFFECT OF ACTUAL SHADOW CAME OVER HIS FACE I WISH YOU COULD STAY WITH ME HE SAID SLOWLY
5570-73846-0019 WHAT I GO THROUGH IT WAS AS IF A CHILD HAD ASKED ON THE VERGE OF TERROR FOR A CANDLE IN THE DARK BUT AN HOUR'S TERROR IS BETTER THAN A LIFETIME OF TIMIDITY SHEILA SIGHED I THINK SHE SAID
5570-73846-0020 I TOO MIGHT SAY THAT BUT THERE GIVING WAY WILL DO NOTHING FOR EITHER OF US
5570-73846-0021 SHE'D WORM A SECRET OUT OF ONE'S GRAVE IT'S USELESS TO DISCUSS THAT ARTHUR YOU HAVE ALWAYS CONSISTENTLY DISLIKED MY FRIENDS IT'S SCARCELY LIKELY THAT YOU WOULD FIND ANY IMPROVEMENT IN THEM NOW OH WELL HE BEGAN
5570-73846-0022 HE STOOD UP IT IS USELESS TO ARGUE IF I DO NOT GO OUT I SHALL CERTAINLY GO MAD AS FOR CRIMINAL WHY THAT'S A WOMAN'S WORD WHO ON EARTH IS TO KNOW ME
5570-73846-0023 THAT YOU ARE CERTAIN TO BE SEEN EITHER GOING OR RETURNING THAT ALICE IS BOUND TO DISCOVER THAT YOU ARE WELL ENOUGH TO GO OUT AND YET NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO SAY GOOD NIGHT TO YOUR OWN DAUGHTER OH IT'S MONSTROUS
5570-73846-0024 IT'S A FRANTIC A HEARTLESS THING TO DO HER VOICE VAGUELY SUGGESTED TEARS LAWFORD EYED HER COLDLY AND STUBBORNLY THINKING OF THE EMPTY ROOM HE WOULD LEAVE AWAITING HIS RETURN ITS LAMP BURNING
5570-73846-0025 ITS FIRE FLAMES SHINING IT WAS ALMOST A PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT THIS LONGING UNSPEAKABLE FOR THE TWILIGHT THE GREEN SECRECY AND THE SILENCE OF THE GRAVES KEEP THEM OUT OF THE WAY HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
5570-73846-0026 IT WILL BE DARK WHEN I COME IN HIS HARDENED FACE LIT UP IT'S USELESS TO ATTEMPT TO DISSUADE ME WHY MUST YOU ALWAYS BE HURTING ME
5570-73846-0027 HUSBAND AND WIFE FACED EACH OTHER ACROSS THE CLEAR LIT ROOM HE DID NOT ANSWER FOR THE LAST TIME SHE SAID IN A QUIET HARD VOICE I ASK YOU NOT TO GO
