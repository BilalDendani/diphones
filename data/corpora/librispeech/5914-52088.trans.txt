5914-52088-0000 AND POUR IT DOWN THE GUN THEN TAKE A BULLET WET OUT OF YOUR MOUTH AND DROP IT INTO THE BARREL USING NO RAMROD THE WET WILL CAKE THE BULLET PRETTY FIRMLY IN ITS RIGHT PLACE FIRING IN FIRING DO NOT BRING THE GUN TO YOUR SHOULDER
5914-52088-0001 IS ONE OF COMPARATIVE STEADINESS AND IS THEREFORE THE PROPER INSTANT FOR PULLING THE TRIGGER ON WATER BOAT SHOOTING A LANDING NET SHOULD BE TAKEN IN THE BOAT AS COLONEL HAWKER WELL ADVISES
5914-52088-0002 TO PICK UP THE DEAD BIRDS AS THEY FLOAT ON THE WATER WHILE THE BOAT PASSES QUICKLY BY THEM SHOOTING OVER WATER WHEN SHOOTING FROM A RIVER BANK WITHOUT BOAT OR DOG TAKE A LONG LIGHT STRING WITH A STICK TIED TO ONE END OF IT
5914-52088-0003 THE OTHER BEING HELD IN THE HAND BY THROWING THE STICK BEYOND THE FLOATING BIRD IT CAN GRADUALLY BE DRAWN IN THE STICK SHOULD BE ONE AND A HALF OR TWO FEET LONG TWO INCHES IN DIAMETER AND NOTCHED AT EITHER END
5914-52088-0004 AND ATTACHED TO THE HAND LINE BY A COUPLE OF STRINGS EACH SIX FEET LONG TIED ROUND EITHER NOTCH THUS THE HAND LINE TERMINATES IN A TRIANGLE SEE THE FIGURE I HAVE GIVEN OF A RUDE STIRRUP THE TWO SIDES OF WHICH ARE OF STRING
5914-52088-0005 WITH THE STICK FOR A BASE A STOUT STICK OF THIS KIND CAN BE THROWN TO A GREAT DISTANCE EITHER IT MAY BE HEAVED AS A SAILOR'S DEEP SEA LEAD OR IT MAY BE WHIRLED ROUND THE HEAD AND THEN LET FLY NIGHT SHOOTING
5914-52088-0006 TIE A BAND OF WHITE PAPER ROUND THE MUZZLE OF THE GUN BEHIND THE SIGHT MISTER ANDERSSON WHO HAS HAD VERY GREAT EXPERIENCE TIES THE PAPER NOT ROUND THE SMOOTH BARREL BUT OVER THE SIGHT AND ALL AND IF THE SIGHT DOES NOT HAPPEN TO BE A LARGE ONE
5914-52088-0007 HE TIES A PIECE OF THICK STRING ROUND THE BARREL OR USES OTHER SIMILAR CONTRIVANCE TO TILT UP THE FORE END OF THE PAPER BY THIS MEANS THE PAPER IS NOT ENTIRELY LOST SIGHT OF AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE AIM IS BEING TAKEN
5914-52088-0008 MISTER ANDERSSON ALSO PINCHES THE PAPER INTO A RIDGE ALONG THE MIDDLE OF THE GUN TO ENSURE A MORE DEFINED FORESIGHT NOCTURNAL ANIMALS
5914-52088-0009 THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF NIGHT FEEDING ANIMALS UPON WHOSE FLESH A TRAVELLER MIGHT EASILY SUPPORT HIMSELF BUT OF WHOSE EXISTENCE HE WOULD HAVE FEW INDICATIONS BY DAYLIGHT OBSERVATION ONLY THE FOLLOWING REMARKS OF PROFESSOR OWEN
5914-52088-0010 IT PREFERS THE EARLY MORNING DAWN OR THE SHORT TWILIGHT AND ABOVE ALL THE BRIGHT MOONLIGHT NIGHTS WITH REGARD TO MOST OF THE OTHER AUSTRALIAN FORMS OF MARSUPIAL ANIMALS THEY ARE MOST STRICTLY NOCTURNAL
5914-52088-0011 SO THAT IF A TRAVELLER WERE NOT AWARE OF THAT PECULIARITY HE MIGHT FANCY HIMSELF TRAVERSING A COUNTRY DESTITUTE OF THE MAMMALIAN GRADE OF ANIMAL LIFE IF HOWEVER AFTER A WEARY DAY'S JOURNEY HE COULD BE AWAKENED
5914-52088-0012 WERE TO BE MET WITH IN PLACES WHERE THERE WAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST APPEARANCE OF THEM IN THE DAYTIME BATTUES IN SWEDEN WHERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE MARSHALLED EACH MAN HAS A NUMBER AND THE NUMBER IS CHALKED UPON HIS HAT
5914-52088-0013 SCARECROWS A STRING WITH FEATHERS TIED TO IT AT INTERVALS LIKE THE TAIL OF A BOY'S KITE WILL SCARE MOST ANIMALS OF THE DEER TRIBE BY THEIR FLUTTERING AND IN WANT OF A SUFFICIENT FORCE OF MEN PASSES MAY BE CLOSED BY THIS CONTRIVANCE
5914-52088-0014 VIZ PIECES OF CANVAS OF HALF THE HEIGHT OF A MAN PAINTED IN GLARING COLOURS AND LEFT TO FLUTTER FROM A LINE MISTER LLOYD TELLS US OF A PEASANT WHO WHEN WALKING WITHOUT A GUN SAW A GLUTTON UP IN A TREE
5914-52088-0015 HE AT ONCE TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND COAT AND RIGGED OUT A SCARECROW THE COUNTERPART OF HIMSELF WHICH HE FIXED CLOSE BY FOR THE PURPOSE OF FRIGHTENING THE BEAST FROM COMING DOWN HE THEN WENT LEISURELY HOME TO FETCH HIS GUN
5914-52088-0016 THIS NOTABLE EXPEDIENT SUCCEEDED PERFECTLY STALKING HORSES ARTIFICIAL A STALKING HORSE OR COW IS MADE BY CUTTING OUT A PIECE OF STRONG CANVAS INTO THE SHAPE OF THE ANIMAL AND PAINTING IT PROPERLY
5914-52088-0017 LOOPS ARE SEWN IN DIFFERENT PLACES THROUGH WHICH STICKS ARE PASSED TO STRETCH THE CURVES INTO SHAPE A STAKE PLANTED IN THE GROUND SERVES AS A BUTTRESS TO SUPPORT THE APPARATUS AT A PROPER HEIGHT
5914-52088-0018 THEY ARE SAID TO ENTER INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE THING AND TO SHOW WONDERFUL CRAFT WALKING ROUND AND ROUND THE OBJECT IN NARROWING CIRCLES AND STOPPING TO GRAZE UNCONCERNEDLY ON WITNESSING THE LEAST SIGN OF ALARM
5914-52088-0019 OXEN ARE TAUGHT TO OBEY A TOUCH ON THE HORN THE COMMON BUT CRUEL WAY OF TRAINING THEM IS TO HAMMER AND BATTER THE HORNS FOR HOURS TOGETHER
5914-52088-0020 PAN HUNTING USED AT SALT LICKS PAN HUNTING IS A METHOD OF HUNTING DEER AT NIGHT AN IRON PAN ATTACHED TO A LONG STICK SERVING AS A HANDLE IS CARRIED IN THE LEFT HAND OVER THE LEFT SHOULDER
5914-52088-0021 FORMING A FORK ON WHICH TO REST THE RIFLE WHEN FIRING THE PAN IS FILLED WITH BURNING PINE KNOTS WHICH BEING SATURATED WITH TURPENTINE SHED A BRILLIANT AND CONSTANT LIGHT ALL AROUND
5914-52088-0022 SHINING INTO THE EYES OF ANY DEER THAT MAY COME IN THAT DIRECTION AND MAKING THEM LOOK LIKE TWO BALLS OF FIRE THE EFFECT IS MOST CURIOUS TO THOSE UNACCUMSTOMED TO IT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE EYES OF THE DEER AS HE APPROACHES APPEARS GRADUALLY TO INCREASE
5914-52088-0023 IS FAR MORE EASILY AVOIDED THAN IS USUALLY SUPPOSED THE WAY THE SPANISH BULL FIGHTERS PLAY WITH THE BULL IS WELL KNOWN ANY MAN CAN AVOID A MERE HEADLONG CHARGE EVEN THE SPEED OF A RACER
5914-52088-0024 DOES NOT EXCEED THIRTY MILES AN HOUR OR FOUR TIMES THE SPEED OF A MAN THE SPEED OF AN ORDINARY HORSE IS NOT MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR MILES AN HOUR NOW EVEN THE FASTEST WILD BEAST IS UNABLE TO CATCH AN ORDINARY HORSE
5914-52088-0025 BY DODGING TO ONE SIDE OR OTHER OF A BUSH FEW ANIMALS TURN IF THE RUSH BE UNSUCCESSFUL THE BUFFALO IS AN EXCEPTION HE REGULARLY HUNTS A MAN AND IS THEREFORE PECULIARLY DANGEROUS
5914-52088-0026 UNTHINKING PERSONS TALK OF THE FEARFUL RAPIDITY OF A LION OR TIGER'S SPRING IT IS NOT RAPID AT ALL IT IS A SLOW MOVEMENT AS MUST BE EVIDENT FROM THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATION NO WILD ANIMAL CAN LEAP TEN YARDS
5914-52088-0027 AND THEY ALL MAKE A HIGH TRAJECTORY IN THEIR LEAPS NOW THINK OF THE SPEED OF A BALL THROWN OR RATHER PITCHED WITH JUST SUFFICIENT FORCE TO BE CAUGHT BY A PERSON TEN YARDS OFF IT IS A MERE NOTHING THE CATCHER CAN PLAY WITH IT AS HE LIKES
5914-52088-0028 HE HAS EVEN TIME TO TURN AFTER IT IF THROWN WIDE BUT THE SPEED OF A SPRINGING ANIMAL IS UNDENIABLY THE SAME AS THAT OF A BALL THROWN SO AS TO MAKE A FLIGHT OF EQUAL LENGTH AND HEIGHT IN THE AIR THE COROLLARY TO ALL THIS IS THAT IF CHARGED
5914-52088-0029 YOU MUST KEEP COOL AND WATCHFUL AND YOUR CHANCE OF ESCAPE IS FAR GREATER THAN NON SPORTSMEN WOULD IMAGINE THE BLOW OF THE FREE PAW IS FAR SWIFTER THAN THE BOUND DOGS KEPT AT BAY A CORRESPONDENT ASSURES ME
5914-52088-0030 THAT A DOG FLYING AT A MAN MAY BE SUCCESSFULLY REPELLED BY MEANS OF A STOUT STICK HELD HORIZONTALLY A HAND AT EACH END AND USED TO THRUST THE DOG BACKWARDS OVER BY MEETING HIM ACROSS THE THROAT OR BREAST
5914-52088-0031 IF FOLLOWED BY A BLOW ON THE NOSE AS THE BRUTE IS FALLING THE RESULT WILL BE SOONER ATTAINED A WATCH DOG USUALLY DESISTS FROM FLYING AT A STRANGER WHEN HE SEATS HIMSELF QUIETLY ON THE GROUND LIKE ULYSSES
5914-52088-0032 THE DOG THEN CONTENTS HIMSELF WITH BARKING AND KEEPING GUARD UNTIL HIS MASTER ARRIVES HIDING GAME IN HIDING GAME FROM BIRDS OF PREY BRUSH IT OVER AND THEY WILL SELDOM FIND IT OUT BIRDS CANNOT SMELL WELL BUT THEY HAVE KEEN EYES
5914-52088-0033 SEE SCARECROWS TYING UP YOUR HORSE YOU MAY TIE YOUR HORSE ON A BARE PLAIN TO THE HORNS OF AN ANIMAL THAT YOU HAVE SHOT WHILE YOU ARE SKINNING HIM BUT IT IS BETTER TO HOBBLE THE HORSE WITH A STIRRUP LEATHER SEE SHOOTING HORSE
5914-52088-0034 DIVISION OF GAME SOME RULES ARE NECESSARY IN THESE MATTERS TO AVOID DISPUTES ESPECIALLY BETWEEN WHITES AND NATIVES AND THEREFORE THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY MUST BE ATTENDED TO BUT IT IS A VERY GENERAL AND CONVENIENT RULE
5914-52088-0035 IT MUST HOWEVER BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MAN WHO GAVE THE FIRST WOUND SHOULD NOT THENCEFORWARD WITHDRAW FROM THE CHASE IF HE DOES SO HIS CLAIM IS LOST IN AMERICA THE SKIN BELONGS TO THE FIRST SHOT THE CARCASE IS DIVIDED EQUALLY AMONG THE WHOLE PARTY
5914-52088-0036 IT IS CONVENIENT TO SINK A LARGE BARREL INTO THE FLAT MARSH OR MUD AS A DRY PLACE TO STAND OR SIT IN WHEN WAITING FOR THE BIRDS TO COME A LADY SUGGESTS TO ME THAT IF THE SPORTSMAN TOOK A BOTTLE OF HOT WATER TO PUT UNDER HIS FEET
5914-52088-0037 IT WOULD BE A GREAT COMFORT TO HIM AND IN THIS I QUITE AGREE I WOULD TAKE A KEG OF HOT WATER WHEN ABOUT IT
5914-52088-0038 I KILLED SEVERAL CROCODILES BY DIGGING PITS ON THE SAND ISLANDS AND SLEEPING A PART OF THE NIGHT IN THEM A DRY SHRED OF PALM BRANCH THE COLOUR OF THE SAND ROUND THE HOLE FORMED A SCREEN TO PUT THE GUN THROUGH THEIR FLESH WAS MOST EXCELLENT EATING
5914-52088-0039 HALF WAY BETWEEN MEAT AND FISH I HAD IT SEVERAL TIMES THE DIFFICULTY OF SHOOTING THEM WAS THAT THE FALCONS AND SPURWING PLOVERS WOULD HOVER ROUND THE PIT WHEN THE CROCODILES INVARIABLY TOOK TO THE WATER THEIR SIGHT AND HEARING WERE GOOD
5914-52088-0040 BUT IF THE GROUND BE HARD SPRINKLE SAND OVER IT IN ORDER TO SHOW THE TRACKS MORE CLEARLY IT IS RELATED IN THE APOCRYPHA THAT THE PROPHET DANIEL DID THIS WHEN HE WISHED TO LEARN WHO IT REALLY WAS WHO EVERY NIGHT CONSUMED THE MEAT
5914-52088-0041 WHICH WAS PLACED BEFORE THE IDOL OF BEL AND WHICH THE IDOL ITSELF WAS SUPPOSED TO EAT HE THUS DISCOVERED THAT THE PRIESTS AND THEIR FAMILIES HAD A SECRET DOOR BY WHICH THEY ENTERED THE TEMPLE AND CONVINCED THE KING OF THE MATTER BY SHOWING HIM THEIR FOOTPRINTS
5914-52088-0042 CARRYING GAME TO CARRY SMALL GAME AS FALLOW DEER MAKE A LONG SLIT WITH YOUR KNIFE BETWEEN THE BACK SINEW AND THE BONE OF BOTH OF THE HIND LEGS CUT A THICK POLE OF WOOD AND A STOUT WOODEN SKEWER EIGHT INCHES LONG
5914-52088-0043 IN ANIMALS WHOSE BACK SINEW IS NOT VERY PROMINENT IT IS BEST TO CROSS THE LEGS AS ABOVE AND TO LASH THEM TOGETHER ALWAYS TAKE THE BOWELS OUT OF GAME BEFORE CARRYING IT IT IS SO MUCH WEIGHT SAVED
5914-52088-0044 HAVING FIRST PERFORMED AN INCISION BETWEEN THE BONE AND THE SINEWS WITH THE COUTEAU DE CHASSE ACCORDING TO COLONIAL USAGE CUMMING'S LIFE IN SOUTH AFRICA
5914-52088-0045 HE CUT AWAY THE FLESH FROM THE BONES IN ONE PIECE WITHOUT SEPARATING THE LIMBS SO AS TO LEAVE SUSPENDED FROM THE TREE MERELY THE SKELETON OF THE DEER THIS IT APPEARED WAS THE TURKISH FASHION IN USE UPON LONG JOURNEYS
5914-52088-0046 IN ORDER TO RELIEVE TRAVELLERS FROM THE USELESS BURDEN OF BONES HUC'S TARTARY SEE ALSO THE SECTION ON HEAVY WEIGHTS TO RAISE AND CARRY ESPECIALLY MISTER WYNDHAM'S PLAN TO FLOAT CARCASES OF GAME ACROSS A RIVER
5914-52088-0047 SIR S BAKER RECOMMENDS STRIPPING OFF THE SKIN OF THE ANIMAL AS THOUGH IT WERE INTENDED TO MAKE A WATER SKIN OF IT PUTTING A STONE UP THE NECK END OF THE SKIN THUS FORMING A WATER TIGHT SACK OPEN AT ONE END ONLY
5914-52088-0048 ALL THE FLESH IS NOW TO BE CUT OFF THE BONES AND PACKED INTO THE SACK WHICH IS THEN TO BE INFLATED AND SECURED BY TYING UP THE OPEN END THE SKIN OF A LARGE ANTELOPE THUS INFLATED WILL NOT ONLY FLOAT THE WHOLE OF THE FLESH
5914-52088-0049 BUT WILL ALSO SUPPORT SEVERAL SWIMMERS TO CARRY IVORY ON PACK ANIMALS THE NORTH AFRICAN TRADERS USE NETS SLINGING TWO LARGE TEETH ON EACH SIDE OF AN ASS SMALL TEETH ARE WRAPPED UP IN SKINS AND SECURED WITH ROPE MUNGO PARK
5914-52088-0050 SETTING A GUN AS A SPRING GUN GENERAL REMARKS THE STRING THAT GOES ACROSS THE PATHWAY SHOULD BE DARK COLOURED AND SO FINE THAT IF THE BEAST STRUGGLES AGAINST IT IT SHOULD BREAK RATHER THAN CAUSE INJURY TO THE GUN I MUST HOWEVER ADD
5914-52088-0051 BEING SET WITH SUCCESS FOR LARGE BEASTS OF PREY I HAVE NEVER KNOWN OF INJURY OCCURRING TO THE GUN THE HEIGHT OF THE MUZZLE SHOULD BE PROPERLY ARRANGED WITH REGARD TO THE HEIGHT OF THE EXPECTED ANIMAL THUS THE HEART OF A HYENA IS THE HEIGHT OF A MAN'S KNEE ABOVE THE GROUND
5914-52088-0052 THE BOTTOM OF THE LEVER STICK IS TIED TO THE TRIGGER AND THE TOP OF IT TO A LONG FINE DARK COLOURED STRING WHICH IS PASSED THROUGH THE EMPTY RAMROD TUBES
5914-52088-0053 TO THE OUTER SIDE OVER THE COMB AND LET THE LONG END OF THE LEVER REST AGAINST THE STAKE THE PRESSURE OF THE HAMMER WILL KEEP THE LEVER STEADY AGAINST THE STAKE TO PREVENT THE LOWER END OF THE STAKE FLYING OUT FROM THE PRESSURE OF THE LEVER ON THE UPPER PART
5914-52088-0054 PLACE A LOG OR STONE AGAINST THE FOOT AN ANIMAL PUSHING AGAINST THE BLACK STRING DRAWS THE UPPER END OF THE STAKE TOWARDS THE MUZZLE UNTIL THE LEVER IS DISENGAGED AND RELEASES THE HAMMER IN LAYING THE LONG ARM OF THE LEVER AGAINST THE STAKE
5914-52088-0055 AND ENABLE THE LEVERS TO DISENGAGE WITHOUT ENTANGLING THE CARCASE OR LIVE BAIT MUST BE HEDGED ROUND AND MEANS ADOPTED TO GUIDE THE LEOPARD ACROSS THE STRING BY RUNNING OUT A SHORT HEDGE ON ONE SIDE IN THIS CASE
5914-52088-0056 AND SOME FOUR INCHES FROM THE LINE OF FIRE THE BREAST THAN CATCHES THE STRING AND THE PUSH RELEASES THE HAMMER WHEN THE MUZZLE IS IN LINE WITH THE CHEST ON THIS PRINCIPLE TWO OR MORE GUNS CAN BE SET SLIGHTLY VARYING IN ELEVATION
5914-52088-0057 TO ALLOW OF ONE BARREL AT LEAST BEING EFFECTIVE BOW AND ARROW SET FOR BEASTS THE CHINESE HAVE SOME EQUIVALENT CONTRIVANCE WITH BOWS AND ARROWS M HUC TELLS US THAT A SIMPLY CONSTRUCTED MACHINE IS SOLD IN THE SHOPS
5914-52088-0058 BY WHICH WHEN SPRUNG A NUMBER OF POISONED ARROWS ARE FIRED OFF IN SUCCESSION
5914-52088-0059 THEY USE SPRING GUNS AND USED TO HAVE SPRING BOWS IN SWEDEN AND IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES KNIVES HUNTING KNIFE A GREAT HUNTING KNIFE IS A USELESS ENCUMBRANCE NO OLD SPORTSMAN OR TRAVELLER CARES TO ENCUMBER HIMSELF WITH ONE
5914-52088-0060 IF A TRAVELLER WANTS A POCKET KNIFE FULL OF ALL KINDS OF TOOLS HE HAD BEST ORDER A VERY LIGHT ONE OF TWO AND THREE QUARTERS INCHES LONG IN A TORTOISE SHELL HANDLE WITHOUT THE USUAL TURNSCREW AT THE END IT SHOULD HAVE A LIGHT PICKER TO SHUT OVER ITS BACK
5914-52088-0061 THIS WILL ACT AS A STRIKE LIGHT AND A FILE ALSO IF ITS UNDER SURFACE BE PROPERLY ROUGHENED UNDERNEATH THE PICKER THERE SHOULD BE A SMALL TRIANGULAR BORER FOR MAKING HOLES IN LEATHER AND A GIMLET
5914-52088-0062 THE FRONT OF THE KNIFE SHOULD CONTAIN A LONG NARROW PEN BLADE OF SOFT STEEL A COBBLER'S AWL SLIGHTLY BENT AND A PACKING NEEDLE WITH A LARGE EYE TO PUSH THONGS AND TWINE THROUGH HOLES IN LEATHER BETWEEN THE TORTOISE SHELL PART OF THE HANDLE
5914-52088-0063 AND THE METAL FRAME OF THE KNIFE SHOULD BE A SPACE TO CONTAIN THREE FLAT THIN PIECES OF STEEL TURNING ON THE SAME PIVOT THE ENDS OF THESE ARE TO BE GROUND TO FORM TURNSCREWS OF BRASS INSTRUMENTS WHEN THIS EXCELLENT CONTRIVANCE IS USED
5914-52088-0064 IT MUST BE OPENED OUT LIKE THE LETTER T THE FOOT OF WHICH REPRESENTS THE TURNSCREW IN USE AND THE HORIZONTAL PART REPRESENTS THE OTHER TWO TURNSCREWS WHICH SERVE AS THE HANDLE IT MAY BE THOUGHT ADVISABLE TO ADD A BUTTON HOOK A CORKSCREW AND A LARGE BLADE
5914-52088-0065 BUT THAT IS NOT MY RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE IT INCREASES THE SIZE OF THE KNIFE AND MAKES IT HEAVY NOW A HEAVY KNIFE IS APT TO BE LAID BY AND NOT TO BE AT HAND WHEN WANTED WHILE A LIGHT KNIFE IS A CONSTANT POCKET COMPANION
5914-52088-0066 OTHERWISE HE HOLDS IT BETWEEN HIS TEETH SUBSTITUTES FOR KNIVES STEEL IS NO DOUBT VASTLY BETTER THAN IRON BUT IT IS NOT ESSENTIAL FOR THE ORDINARY PURPOSES OF LIFE INDEED MOST ANCIENT CIVILIZED NATIONS
5914-52088-0067 HAD NOTHING BETTER THAN IRON ANY BIT OF GOOD IRON MAY BE HEATED AS HOT AS THE CAMP FIRE ADMITS HAMMERED FLAT LASHED INTO A HANDLE AND SHARPENED ON A STONE A FRAGMENT OF FLINT OR OBSIDIAN MAY BE MADE FAST TO A HANDLE
5914-52088-0068 OPERA GLASSES ARE INVALUABLE AS NIGHT GLASSES FOR BY THEIR AID THE SIGHT OF MAN IS RAISED NEARLY TO A PAR WITH THAT OF NIGHT ROVING ANIMALS THEREFORE A SPORTSMAN WOULD FIND THEM OF GREAT SERVICE WHEN WATCHING FOR GAME AT NIGHT
