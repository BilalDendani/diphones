8848-293957-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE DIARY BEFORE MISS BERENGARIA COULD COMMUNICATE WITH DURHAM HE HAD LEFT THE CASTLE FOR TOWN ON HEARING THIS FROM BERNARD THE OLD LADY AT ONCE SENT UP TO HIM A FULL REPORT OF THE ARRIVAL OF MICHAEL AT THE BOWER
8848-293957-0001 UNDER THE NAME OF GORE HE IS NOW A TRIFLE BETTER WROTE MISS BERENGARIA BUT HAVING SUFFERED FROM GREAT PRIVATIONS HE IS STILL ILL AND SO FAR AS I CAN SEE IS LIKELY TO KEEP TO HIS BED FOR SOME TIME PAYNE IS ATTENDING TO HIM
8848-293957-0002 AND SAYS HE NEEDS CAREFUL NURSING AND TONICS HE IS SO WEAK AS TO BE SCARCELY ABLE TO TALK WHICH IS PERHAPS ALL THE BETTER AS ALICE AND I MIGHT AROUSE HIS SUSPICIONS WE HAVE ACCEPTED HIM AS BERNARD AND WHEN YOU COME DOWN YOU CAN QUESTION HIM EITHER IN THAT CHARACTER OR AS MICHAEL
8848-293957-0003 TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I AM SORRY FOR THE BOY HE IS ONLY TWENTY ONE OR THEREABOUTS AND I THINK HE HAS BEEN MISGUIDED AFTER ALL EVEN HE MAY NOT HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME
8848-293957-0004 I AM MUCH WORRIED OVER IT CONNISTON COMES OVER DAILY TO SEE LUCY RANDOLPH AT THE HALL BUT HE IS SO FEATHER BRAINED A CREATURE THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT ENTRUSTING SUCH A SECRET TO HIM NOR DO I WISH BERNARD TO KNOW WITH HIS IMPETUOSITY
8848-293957-0005 HE WOULD PROBABLY COME OVER AT ONCE AND RUN THE CHANCE OF ARREST THE WHOLE MATTER IS IN YOUR HANDS DURHAM SO WRITE AND TELL ME WHAT I AM TO DO AT ALL EVENTS I HAVE A FAST HOLD OF BERNARD'S DOUBLE AND YOU MAY BE SURE I SHALL NOT ALLOW HIM TO GO UNTIL THIS MYSTERY IS CLEARED UP
8848-293957-0006 IN REPLY TO THIS PRESSING EPISTLE DURHAM WROTE TELLING MISS BERENGARIA TO WAIT FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS HE WAS ADVERTISING FOR TOLOMEO AND HOPED TO SEE HIM AT HIS OFFICE IF AS DURHAM THOUGHT
8848-293957-0007 THE ITALIAN HAD BEEN WITH SIR SIMON ON THAT NIGHT SOMETHING MIGHT BE LEARNED FROM HIM LIKELY TO PROVE THE PRESENCE OF MICHAEL IN THE ROOM THE EXAMINATION OF MICHAEL WHICH DURHAM PROPOSED TO MAKE WOULD THEN BE RENDERED MUCH EASIER THE LAWYER IN CONCLUSION QUITE AGREED WITH MISS PLANTAGENET
8848-293957-0008 THAT CONNISTON AND BERNARD SHOULD NOT BE TOLD I HOPE TO BE WITH YOU BY THE END OF THE WEEK HE FINISHED DEUCE TAKE THE MAN SAID MISS BERENGARIA RUBBING HER NOSE DOES HE THINK I CAN WAIT ALL THAT TIME
8848-293957-0009 I DON'T SEE WHAT ELSE YOU CAN DO AUNT SAID ALICE WHEN THE LETTER WAS READ AND THIS POOR CREATURE IS SO WEAK THAT I DO NOT THINK HE WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK MUCH FOR A FEW DAYS
8848-293957-0010 PERHAPS THAT IS WHY HE HOLDS HIS TONGUE SAID ALICE RISING BUT WE MUST WAIT AUNT I SUPPOSE WE MUST SAID MISS BERENGARIA DOLEFULLY DRAT THE WHOLE BUSINESS WAS THERE EVER SUCH A COIL WELL THEN AUNT WILL YOU LEAVE IT ALONE CERTAINLY NOT
8848-293957-0011 I INTEND TO SEE THE THING THROUGH OWING TO MY RETICENCE TO SIR SIMON ABOUT YOUR PARENTS ALICE I AM REALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WHOLE BUSINESS SO I WILL KEEP WORKING AT IT UNTIL BERNARD IS OUT OF DANGER AND MARRIED TO YOU AH SIGHED MISS MALLESON
8848-293957-0012 AND WHEN WILL THAT BE SOONER THAN YOU THINK PERHAPS EVERY DAY BRINGS A SURPRISE ONE DAY CERTAINLY BROUGHT A SURPRISE TO LUCY RANDOLPH SHE LEARNED THAT CONNISTON LOVED HER THOUGH TO BE SURE HIS FREQUENT VISITS MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HER HOW HE WAS LOSING HIS HEART
8848-293957-0013 SHE WAS GLAD OF THIS AS SHE ADMIRED CONNISTON EXCEEDINGLY AND MOREOVER WISHED TO ESCAPE FROM HER AWKWARD POSITION AT THE HALL WHEN BERNARD CAME BACK AND MARRIED ALICE SHE WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE THE HALL AND LIVE ON THE SMALL INCOME ALLOTTED TO HER BY THE GENEROSITY OF THE DEAD MAN
8848-293957-0014 TO MARRY CONNISTON EVEN THOUGH HE WAS THE POOREST OF PEERS ONE CAN DO A LOT WITH A TITLE EVEN WITHOUT MONEY AND LUCY WAS WISE IN HER GENERATION MOREOVER SHE WAS TRULY IN LOVE WITH THE YOUNG MAN AND THOUGHT VERY RIGHTLY THAT HE WOULD MAKE HER A GOOD HUSBAND
8848-293957-0015 AS USUAL CONNISTON HAVING TAKEN INTO HIS HEAD THAT LUCY WOULD BE AN IDEAL WIFE PURSUED HIS SUIT WITH CHARACTERISTIC IMPETUOSITY
8848-293957-0016 AND FINALLY WHEN LUCY BROKE OFF HER ENGAGEMENT TO BERYL HE TOLD HER OF THE WHEREABOUTS OF BERNARD LUCY WAS OVERWHELMED AND DELIGHTED TO THINK THAT HE SHOULD BE ALIVE AFTER ALL SHE SAID I AM SO PLEASED SO GLAD DEAR BERNARD
8848-293957-0017 NOW HE WILL BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE FORTUNE AND THE TITLE AND MARRY ALICE YOU FORGET SAID CONNISTON A TRIFLE DRYLY BERNARD HAS YET TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE WE ARE ALL TRYING TO HELP HIM WILL YOU ALSO GIVE A HAND MISS RANDOLPH
8848-293957-0018 LUCY STARED AT HIM WITH WIDELY OPEN EYES OF COURSE I WILL LORD CONNISTON SHE SAID HEARTILY WHAT DO YOU WISH ME TO DO IN THE FIRST PLACE TELL ME IF YOU SENT A BOY TO BRING BERNARD TO CRIMEA SQUARE NO I KNOW THE BOY YOU MEAN
8848-293957-0019 HE IS A LAD CALLED JERRY MOON JULIUS FOUND HIM SELLING MATCHES IN TOWN RAGGED AND POOR HE HELPED HIM AND THE OTHER DAY HE PROCURED HIM A SITUATION WITH MISS BERENGARIA HE IS THERE NOW BUT HE WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
8848-293957-0020 IS THE BOY WHO LURED BERNARD TO CRIMEA SQUARE I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT SAID LUCY FRANKLY WHY NOT ASK THE BOY HIMSELF IT WOULD BE EASY WE WILL ASK THE BOY SHORTLY REPLIED CONNISTON EVASIVELY
8848-293957-0021 NOT WISHING AT THIS JUNCTURE TO TELL HER THAT THE GREAT OBJECT OF EVERYONE WAS TO PREVENT JERRY THINKING HE WAS SUSPECTED SHOULD YOU MEET THE BOY SAY NOTHING TO HIM I WILL NOT AND I AM NOT LIKELY TO MEET THE BOY
8848-293957-0022 HE IS USUALLY IN MISS PLANTAGENET'S POULTRY YARD AND I RARELY GO ROUND THERE LUCY PAUSED IT IS STRANGE THAT THE BOY SHOULD ACT LIKE THAT I WONDER IF SIR SIMON SENT HIM TO FETCH BERNARD AND ARRANGED THE RED WINDOW AS A SIGN WHICH HOUSE IT WAS
8848-293957-0023 THE RED WINDOW AH YES MISSUS WEBBER SAW THE LIGHT AND AND JULIUS AFTERWARDS DIDN'T I KNOW THAT IT WAS MY FAULT WHEN WE DROVE UP IN THE CARRIAGE ON THAT TERRIBLE NIGHT I SAW THE RED LIGHT
8848-293957-0024 AND WONDERED IF SIR SIMON HAD ARRANGED IT AS A SIGN TO BERNARD WHEN I SAW BERNARD IN THE HALL I WAS NOT ASTONISHED FOR I THOUGHT HE HAD COME IN ANSWER TO THE LIGHT I WENT UPSTAIRS AND AFTER ATTENDING TO SIR SIMON I WENT TO THE WINDOW THE LAMP WAS BEFORE IT AND
8848-293957-0025 STRETCHED ACROSS THE PANE WAS A RED BANDANNA HANDKERCHIEF OF SIR SIMON'S I TOOK THAT AWAY SO YOU SEE HOW IT WAS JULIUS DID NOT SEE THE LIGHT WHY DID YOU REMOVE THE HANDKERCHIEF ASKED THE PUZZLED CONNISTON WELL I WANTED TO SAVE BERNARD IF POSSIBLE
8848-293957-0026 AND I THOUGHT IF THE RED LIGHT WHICH HAD DRAWN HIM WERE REMOVED HE COULD MAKE SOME EXCUSE JULIUS KNEW ABOUT THE RED LIGHT AND AS HE HATED BERNARD I FANCIED HE WOULD USE IT AGAINST HIM BUT REALLY ADDED MISS RANDOLPH WRINKLING HER PRETTY BROWS
8848-293957-0027 I HARDLY KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING SAVE THAT IN SOME VAGUE WAY I FANCIED THE REMOVAL OF THE HANDKERCHIEF MIGHT HELP BERNARD IS THAT CLEAR PERFECTLY CLEAR SAID CONNISTON AND I AM GLAD I KNOW THIS MAY I TELL BERNARD AND DURHAM CERTAINLY
8848-293957-0028 I WANT TO DO ALL I CAN TO HELP BERNARD AH YOU ARE A GOOD WOMAN SAID CONNISTON EAGERLY I WONDER IF YOU COULD MAKE A CHAP GOOD
8848-293957-0029 SAID LUCY SHYLY I KNOW A CHAP WHO PLEASE STOP LORD CONNISTON CRIED LUCY STARTING UP IN CONFUSION I HAVE HEAPS AND HEAPS TO DO YOU PREVENT MY WORKING HER HURRIED FLIGHT PREVENTED CONNISTON FROM PUTTING THE QUESTION ON THAT OCCASION
8848-293957-0030 SHE WAS ANXIOUS THAT BERNARD SHOULD BE CLEARED THAT HE SHOULD TAKE UP HIS RIGHTFUL POSITION AND SHOULD RECEIVE BACK THE HALL FROM HER BEFORE LORD CONNISTON PROPOSED OF COURSE LUCY WAS READY TO ACCEPT HIM BUT SURE OF HER FISH
8848-293957-0031 SHE PLAYED WITH HIM UNTIL SUCH TIME AS SHE FELT DISPOSED TO ACCEPT HIS HAND AND HEART AND TITLE AND WHAT REMAINED OF THE WEST FORTUNE CONNISTON MORE DETERMINED THAN EVER TO WIN THIS ADORABLE WOMAN CAME OVER REGULARLY
8848-293957-0032 BUT LUCY SKILFULLY KEPT HIM OFF THE DANGEROUS GROUND WHEREBY HE FELL DEEPER IN LOVE THAN EVER
8848-293957-0033 BUT WHAT DID SHE KNOW CONNISTON WRIGGLED UNEASILY HE WAS NOT QUITE CERTAIN WHETHER HE OUGHT TO TELL LUCY ALL THAT HAD BEEN DISCOVERED AND HAD HE NOT BEEN IN LOVE WITH HER
8848-293957-0034 BUT AFTER SOME REFLECTION HE DECIDED TO SPEAK OUT YOU ARE OF COURSE ON BERNARD'S SIDE HE SAID YES AND AGAINST JULIUS WHO HATES BERNARD I WILL DO ANYTHING I CAN TO HELP BERNARD I AM SURE YOU CAN SEE THAT
8848-293957-0035 I KNOW I KNOW YOU ARE THE TRUEST AND BEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD SAID CONNISTON EAGERLY BUT WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU IS NOT MY OWN SECRET IT CONCERNS BERNARD THEN DON'T TELL ME
8848-293957-0036 SAID LUCY COLORING ANGRILY YES I WILL YOU HAVE THE DIARY AND I WANT TO READ IT TO KNOW WHY I DO IT IS NECESSARY THAT YOU SHOULD LEARN ALL THAT WE HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT HAVE YOU DISCOVERED WHO KILLED SIR SIMON
8848-293957-0037 MISSUS GILROY IS FIGHTING FOR HER SON IT IS PROBABLE THAT SHE HAS SET DOWN THE EVENTS OF THAT NIGHT IN HER DIARY SHE WOULD NOT BE SUCH A FOOL IF HER SON IS GUILTY OH PEOPLE DO ALL MANNER OF QUEER THINGS CRIMINALS WHO ARE VERY SECRETIVE IN SPEECH SOMETIMES
8848-293957-0038 GIVE THEMSELVES AWAY IN WRITING YOU WERE AT THE THEATRE ON THAT NIGHT YES WITH JULIUS SO NEITHER OF US HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MATTER IF THAT IS WHAT YOU MEAN I MEAN NOTHING OF THE SORT SAID CONNISTON QUICKLY HOW CAN YOU THINK I SHOULD SUSPECT YOU
8848-293957-0039 YOU MIGHT SUSPECT JULIUS SAID LUCY SUSPICIOUSLY AND ALTHOUGH WE HAVE QUARRELLED I DON'T WANT TO HARM HIM WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE BERNARD HANGED OH LUCY BURST INTO TEARS AND IMPULSIVELY THREW THE BOOK INTO CONNISTON'S LAP
8848-293957-0040 READ IT AT ONCE I WOULD RATHER SAVE BERNARD THAN JULIUS CONNISTON AVAILED HIMSELF OF THIS PERMISSION AT ONCE HE TOOK AWAY THE DIARY WITH LUCY'S PERMISSION AND CARRIED IT IN TRIUMPH TO THE CASTLE HERE HE AND BERNARD SAT DOWN TO MASTER ITS CONTENTS
8848-293957-0041 THESE ASTONISHED THEM CONSIDERABLY CONNISTON MADE OUT A SHORT AND CONCISE ACCOUNT OF THE EVENTS OF THAT FATAL NIGHT FOR THE BENEFIT OF DURHAM THEY WERE AS FOLLOWS MISSUS GILROY IT APPEARS THOUGHT THAT HER SON MICHAEL WAS REALLY AND TRULY IN AMERICA
8848-293957-0042 SHE HAD NO SUSPICION THAT THE LOVER OF JANE RIORDAN WAS HER SON BUT TRULY BELIEVED FROM THE DESCRIPTION THAT HE WAS YOUNG GORE WHOM SHE HATED AS SHE PLAINLY STATED IN SEVERAL PAGES WHEN THE PRESUMED BERNARD WENT AWAY BEFORE SIX
8848-293957-0043 HE DID NOT CALL AGAIN AT TEN O'CLOCK THE MAN THAT CALLED MISSUS GILROY ASSERTED WAS BERNARD AND NOT HER SON HE SAW SIR SIMON AND AFTER A STORMY INTERVIEW HE DEPARTED WHY THEN DOESN'T SHE ACCUSE ME OF THE CRIME SAID GORE
8848-293957-0044 WAIT A BIT SAID CONNISTON WHO WAS READING HIS PRECIS THIS DIARY IS MEANT FOR HER EYE ALONE STILL SHE MAY HAVE THOUGHT IT MIGHT FALL INTO THE HANDS OF ANOTHER PERSON AND THEREFORE MADE HER SON SAFE
8848-293957-0045 MICHAEL SAW SIR SIMON AND THEN MISSUS GILROY PRETENDING THE MAN WAS YOU SAYS HE DEPARTED LEAVING YOUR GRANDFATHER ALIVE SEE HERE'S THE BIT AND HE READ SIR SIMON WAS ALIVE AFTER MISTER GORE LEFT THE HOUSE GO ON SAID BERNARD
8848-293957-0046 IF I AM INNOCENT WHY DID SHE ACCUSE ME BECAUSE I BELIEVE HER SON IS GUILTY HE LEFT SIR SIMON DEAD MISSUS GILROY FOUND THE BODY KNEW WHAT HAD OCCURRED AND THEN RAN OUT ON HEARING JERRY'S WHISTLE KNOWING SHE WOULD MEET YOU
8848-293957-0047 IT'S ALL PLAIN VERY PLAIN SAID GORE EMPHATICALLY A REGULAR TRAP GO ON AFTERWARDS AND SHORTLY BEFORE A QUARTER PAST TEN THERE CAME A RING AT THE DOOR MISSUS GILROY WENT AND THERE SHE FOUND SIGNOR TOLOMEO
8848-293957-0048 WHO ASKED TO SEE SIR SIMON SHE TOOK HIM UP THE STAIRS AND LEFT HIM TO SPEAK WITH SIR SIMON WHAT TOOK PLACE SHE DID NOT KNOW BUT SHE WAS SITTING BELOW WORKING AND HEARD THE DOOR CLOSE IT WAS JUST BEFORE A QUARTER TO ELEVEN THAT SHE HEARD THIS
8848-293957-0049 ABOUT THE TIME I CAME MUTTERED BERNARD MISSUS GILROY AS APPEARED FROM THE DIARY RAN UP TO SEE IF THE MASTER WAS ALL RIGHT SHE FOUND HIM STRANGLED AND WITH THE HANDKERCHIEFS TIED OVER HIS MOUTH AND ROUND HIS NECK THEN SHE RAN OUT AND FOUND GORE AT THE DOOR
8848-293957-0050 HE HAD COME BACK AGAIN AND MISSUS GILROY SAID SHE ACCUSED HIM SHE THEN STATED IN HER DIARY THAT SHE LOOKED UPON BERNARD AS AN ACCESSORY AFTER THE FACT HE HAD HIRED GUISEPPE TOLOMEO TO KILL HIS GRANDFATHER AND THEN
8848-293957-0051 CAME TO SEE IF THE DEED HAD BEEN EXECUTED THOROUGHLY MISSUS GILROY ENDED HER DIARY BY STATING THAT SHE WOULD DO HER BEST TO GET BOTH THE ITALIAN AND HIS NEPHEW HANGED
8848-293957-0052 VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HER SAID BERNARD WHEN CONNISTON CONCLUDED READING AND BEGINNING TO WALK TO AND FRO WELL IT SEEMS MY UNCLE IS THE GUILTY PERSON CONNISTON I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID DICK FIRMLY MISSUS GILROY IS TRYING TO SHIELD HER SON
8848-293957-0053 I BELIEVE HE KILLED HIM IF WE COULD ONLY FIND MICHAEL SAID BERNARD DOLEFULLY AH THINGS WOULD SOON BE PUT RIGHT THEN REPLIED CONNISTON AND NEITHER WAS AWARE THAT THE MAN THEY WISHED TO SEE
8848-293957-0054 WAS AT THAT VERY MOMENT LYING IN THE TURRET CHAMBER AT THE BOWER OR EVEN MISSUS GILROY COULD WE SEE HER AND SHOW HER THE DIARY SHE MIGHT PUT THINGS STRAIGHT I BELIEVE SHE LEFT THE DIARY BEHIND ON PURPOSE SAID GORE WITH SOME ILL HUMOR
8848-293957-0055 I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT TOLOMEO KILLED SIR SIMON WHAT KIND OF MAN IS HE A VERY DECENT CHAP IN HIS OWN WAY HIS BLOOD IS HOT AND HE HAS A TEMPER SOMETHING LIKE THE ONE I HAVE INHERITED FROM MY MOTHER WHO WAS GUISEPPE'S SISTER BUT TOLOMEO IS NOT HALF BAD
8848-293957-0056 HE HAS THE CREDIT FOR BEING A SCAMP BUT I DON'T THINK HE DESERVES IT CAN'T YOU SEE HIM AND SHOW HIM THE DIARY NO I DON'T KNOW HIS WHEREABOUTS HOWEVER DURHAM AT MY REQUEST HAS PUT AN ADVERTISEMENT IN THE PAPERS WHICH MAY BRING HIM TO THE OFFICE
8848-293957-0057 I DARESAY TOLOMEO DID SEE SIR SIMON AND DID HAVE A ROW AS BOTH HE AND GRANDFATHER WERE HOT BLOODED BUT I DON'T BELIEVE MY UNCLE KILLED SIR SIMON SAID BERNARD STRIKING THE TABLE WELL DRAWLED CONNISTON
8848-293957-0058 I DON'T SEE WHAT HE HAD TO GAIN TOLOMEO FROM YOUR ACCOUNT OF HIM WOULD NOT COMMIT A MURDER WITHOUT GETTING SOME MONEY FROM DOING IT BUT THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO TAKE THIS UP TO DURHAM AND SEE WHAT HE THINKS I'LL COME TOO SAID GORE EXCITEDLY I TELL YOU DICK
8848-293957-0059 I'M DEAD TIRED OF DOING NOTHING IT WILL BE BETTER TO DO WHAT MISS BERENGARIA SUGGESTS AND GIVE MYSELF UP WAIT A BIT PERSUADED DICK LET ME TAKE THIS UP TO DURHAM AND IF HE AGREES YOU CAN BE ARRESTED BERNARD WAS UNWILLING TO WAIT
8848-293957-0060 BUT FINALLY HE YIELDED SULLENLY TO CONNISTON'S ARGUMENTS
