2090-151646-0000 CHAPTER SIX THE PARSONAGE AGAIN FOR A FEW MONTHS I REMAINED PEACEABLY AT HOME IN THE QUIET ENJOYMENT OF LIBERTY AND REST AND GENUINE FRIENDSHIP FROM ALL OF WHICH I HAD FASTED SO LONG
2090-151646-0001 AND IN THE EARNEST PROSECUTION OF MY STUDIES TO RECOVER WHAT I HAD LOST DURING MY STAY AT WELLWOOD HOUSE AND TO LAY IN NEW STORES FOR FUTURE USE MY FATHER'S HEALTH WAS STILL VERY INFIRM BUT NOT MATERIALLY WORSE THAN WHEN I LAST SAW HIM
2090-151646-0002 AND I WAS GLAD I HAD IT IN MY POWER TO CHEER HIM BY MY RETURN AND TO AMUSE HIM WITH SINGING HIS FAVOURITE SONGS NO ONE TRIUMPHED OVER MY FAILURE OR SAID I HAD BETTER HAVE TAKEN HIS OR HER ADVICE AND QUIETLY STAYED AT HOME
2090-151646-0003 ALL WERE GLAD TO HAVE ME BACK AGAIN AND LAVISHED MORE KINDNESS THAN EVER UPON ME TO MAKE UP FOR THE SUFFERINGS I HAD UNDERGONE BUT NOT ONE WOULD TOUCH A SHILLING OF WHAT I HAD SO CHEERFULLY EARNED AND SO CAREFULLY SAVED
2090-151646-0004 IN THE HOPE OF SHARING IT WITH THEM BY DINT OF PINCHING HERE AND SCRAPING THERE OUR DEBTS WERE ALREADY NEARLY PAID MARY HAD HAD GOOD SUCCESS WITH HER DRAWINGS BUT OUR FATHER HAD INSISTED UPON HER LIKEWISE
2090-151646-0005 KEEPING ALL THE PRODUCE OF HER INDUSTRY TO HERSELF ALL WE COULD SPARE FROM THE SUPPLY OF OUR HUMBLE WARDROBE AND OUR LITTLE CASUAL EXPENSES HE DIRECTED US TO PUT INTO THE SAVINGS' BANK SAYING
2090-151646-0006 WE KNEW NOT HOW SOON WE MIGHT BE DEPENDENT ON THAT ALONE FOR SUPPORT FOR HE FELT HE HAD NOT LONG TO BE WITH US AND WHAT WOULD BECOME OF OUR MOTHER AND US WHEN HE WAS GONE GOD ONLY KNEW DEAR PAPA
2090-151646-0007 I AM CONVINCED THAT DREADED EVENT WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SO SOON MY MOTHER WOULD NEVER SUFFER HIM TO PONDER ON THE SUBJECT IF SHE COULD HELP IT OH RICHARD EXCLAIMED SHE ON ONE OCCASION IF YOU WOULD BUT DISMISS SUCH GLOOMY SUBJECTS FROM YOUR MIND
2090-151646-0008 YOU WOULD LIVE AS LONG AS ANY OF US AT LEAST YOU WOULD LIVE TO SEE THE GIRLS MARRIED AND YOURSELF A HAPPY GRANDFATHER WITH A CANTY OLD DAME FOR YOUR COMPANION MY MOTHER LAUGHED AND SO DID MY FATHER BUT HIS LAUGH SOON PERISHED IN A DREARY SIGH
2090-151646-0009 THEY MARRIED POOR PENNILESS THINGS SAID HE WHO WILL TAKE THEM I WONDER WHY NOBODY SHALL THAT ISN'T THANKFUL FOR THEM WASN'T I PENNILESS WHEN YOU TOOK ME
2090-151646-0010 AND YOU PRETENDED AT LEAST TO BE VASTLY PLEASED WITH YOUR ACQUISITION BUT IT'S NO MATTER WHETHER THEY GET MARRIED OR NOT WE CAN DEVISE A THOUSAND HONEST WAYS OF MAKING A LIVELIHOOD AND I WONDER RICHARD YOU CAN THINK OF BOTHERING YOUR HEAD ABOUT OUR POVERTY
2090-151646-0011 IN CASE OF YOUR DEATH AS IF THAT WOULD BE ANYTHING COMPARED WITH THE CALAMITY OF LOSING YOU AN AFFLICTION THAT YOU WELL KNOW WOULD SWALLOW UP ALL OTHERS AND WHICH YOU OUGHT TO DO YOUR UTMOST TO PRESERVE US FROM AND THERE IS NOTHING LIKE A CHEERFUL MIND FOR KEEPING THE BODY IN HEALTH
2090-151646-0012 I KNOW ALICE IT IS WRONG TO KEEP REPINING AS I DO BUT I CANNOT HELP IT YOU MUST BEAR WITH ME I WON'T BEAR WITH YOU IF I CAN ALTER YOU REPLIED MY MOTHER
2090-151646-0013 BUT THE HARSHNESS OF HER WORDS WAS UNDONE BY THE EARNEST AFFECTION OF HER TONE AND PLEASANT SMILE THAT MADE MY FATHER SMILE AGAIN LESS SADLY AND LESS TRANSIENTLY THAN WAS HIS WONT
2090-151646-0014 MY MONEY IS BUT LITTLE AND CANNOT LAST LONG IF I COULD INCREASE IT IT WOULD LESSEN PAPA'S ANXIETY ON ONE SUBJECT AT LEAST I CANNOT DRAW LIKE MARY AND SO THE BEST THING I COULD DO WOULD BE TO LOOK OUT FOR ANOTHER SITUATION AND SO YOU WOULD ACTUALLY TRY AGAIN AGNES
2090-151646-0015 SOME ARE WORSE INTERRUPTED MY MOTHER BUT NOT MANY I THINK REPLIED I AND I'M SURE ALL CHILDREN ARE NOT LIKE THEIRS FOR I AND MARY WERE NOT WE ALWAYS DID AS YOU BID US DIDN'T WE GENERALLY
2090-151646-0016 BUT THEN I DID NOT SPOIL YOU AND YOU WERE NOT PERFECT ANGELS AFTER ALL MARY HAD A FUND OF QUIET OBSTINACY AND YOU WERE SOMEWHAT FAULTY IN REGARD TO TEMPER BUT YOU WERE VERY GOOD CHILDREN ON THE WHOLE
2090-151646-0017 FOR THEN I COULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD THEM BUT THEY NEVER WERE FOR THEY COULD NOT BE OFFENDED NOR HURT NOR ASHAMED THEY COULD NOT BE UNHAPPY IN ANY WAY EXCEPT WHEN THEY WERE IN A PASSION WELL IF THEY COULD NOT IT WAS NOT THEIR FAULT
2090-151646-0018 YOU CANNOT EXPECT STONE TO BE AS PLIABLE AS CLAY NO BUT STILL IT IS VERY UNPLEASANT TO LIVE WITH SUCH UNIMPRESSIBLE INCOMPREHENSIBLE CREATURES YOU CANNOT LOVE THEM AND IF YOU COULD YOUR LOVE WOULD BE UTTERLY THROWN AWAY
2090-151646-0019 THEY COULD NEITHER RETURN IT NOR VALUE NOR UNDERSTAND IT BUT HOWEVER
2090-151646-0020 AND THE END AND AIM OF THIS PREAMBLE IS LET ME TRY AGAIN WELL MY GIRL YOU ARE NOT EASILY DISCOURAGED I SEE I AM GLAD OF THAT BUT LET ME TELL YOU YOU ARE A GOOD DEAL PALER AND THINNER THAN WHEN YOU FIRST LEFT HOME
2090-151646-0021 EITHER FOR YOURSELF OR OTHERS
2090-151646-0022 FOR I WAS IN A CONSTANT STATE OF AGITATION AND ANXIETY ALL DAY LONG BUT NEXT TIME I AM DETERMINED TO TAKE THINGS COOLLY AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION MY MOTHER PROMISED ONCE MORE TO ASSIST ME PROVIDED I WOULD WAIT AND BE PATIENT
2090-151646-0023 AND I LEFT HER TO BROACH THE MATTER TO MY FATHER WHEN AND HOW SHE DEEMED IT MOST ADVISABLE NEVER DOUBTING HER ABILITY TO OBTAIN HIS CONSENT MEANTIME I SEARCHED WITH GREAT INTEREST THE ADVERTISING COLUMNS OF THE NEWSPAPERS
2090-151646-0024 WANTED A GOVERNESS THAT APPEARED AT ALL ELIGIBLE BUT ALL MY LETTERS AS WELL AS THE REPLIES WHEN I GOT ANY WERE DUTIFULLY SHOWN TO MY MOTHER AND SHE TO MY CHAGRIN MADE ME REJECT THE SITUATIONS ONE AFTER ANOTHER
2090-151646-0025 THESE WERE LOW PEOPLE THESE WERE TOO EXACTING IN THEIR DEMANDS AND THESE TOO NIGGARDLY IN THEIR REMUNERATION YOUR TALENTS ARE NOT SUCH AS EVERY POOR CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER POSSESSES AGNES SHE WOULD SAY AND YOU MUST NOT THROW THEM AWAY
2090-151646-0026 YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME BEFORE YOU AND MAY HAVE MANY CHANCES YET AT LENGTH SHE ADVISED ME TO PUT AN ADVERTISEMENT MYSELF IN THE PAPER
2090-151646-0027 FRENCH LATIN AND GERMAN SAID SHE ARE NO MEAN ASSEMBLAGE MANY WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE SO MUCH IN ONE INSTRUCTOR AND THIS TIME YOU SHALL TRY YOUR FORTUNE IN A SOMEWHAT HIGHER FAMILY
2090-151646-0028 FOR SUCH ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO TREAT YOU WITH PROPER RESPECT AND CONSIDERATION THAN THOSE PURSE PROUD TRADESPEOPLE AND ARROGANT UPSTARTS I HAVE KNOWN SEVERAL AMONG THE HIGHER RANKS WHO TREATED THEIR GOVERNESSES QUITE AS ONE OF THE FAMILY
2090-151646-0029 THOUGH SOME I ALLOW ARE AS INSOLENT AND EXACTING AS ANY ONE ELSE CAN BE FOR THERE ARE BAD AND GOOD IN ALL CLASSES THE ADVERTISEMENT WAS QUICKLY WRITTEN AND DESPATCHED OF THE TWO PARTIES WHO ANSWERED IT
2090-151646-0030 BUT ONE WOULD CONSENT TO GIVE ME FIFTY POUNDS THE SUM MY MOTHER BADE ME NAME AS THE SALARY I SHOULD REQUIRE AND HERE I HESITATED ABOUT ENGAGING MYSELF AS I FEARED THE CHILDREN WOULD BE TOO OLD AND THEIR PARENTS WOULD REQUIRE SOME ONE MORE SHOWY
2090-151646-0031 OR MORE EXPERIENCED IF NOT MORE ACCOMPLISHED THAN I BUT MY MOTHER DISSUADED ME FROM DECLINING IT ON THAT ACCOUNT I SHOULD DO VASTLY WELL SHE SAID IF I WOULD ONLY THROW ASIDE MY DIFFIDENCE AND ACQUIRE A LITTLE MORE CONFIDENCE IN MYSELF
2090-151646-0032 I WAS JUST TO GIVE A PLAIN TRUE STATEMENT OF MY ACQUIREMENTS AND QUALIFICATIONS AND NAME WHAT STIPULATIONS I CHOSE TO MAKE AND THEN AWAIT THE RESULT THE ONLY STIPULATION I VENTURED TO PROPOSE
2090-151646-0033 WAS THAT I MIGHT BE ALLOWED TWO MONTHS HOLIDAYS DURING THE YEAR TO VISIT MY FRIENDS AT MIDSUMMER AND CHRISTMAS THE UNKNOWN LADY IN HER REPLY MADE NO OBJECTION TO THIS AND STATED THAT AS TO MY ACQUIREMENTS SHE HAD NO DOUBT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE SATISFACTION
2090-151646-0034 BUT IN THE ENGAGEMENT OF GOVERNESSES SHE CONSIDERED THOSE THINGS AS BUT SUBORDINATE POINTS AS BEING SITUATED IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF O SHE COULD GET MASTERS TO SUPPLY ANY DEFICIENCIES IN THAT RESPECT BUT IN HER OPINION
2090-151646-0035 NEXT TO UNIMPEACHABLE MORALITY A MILD AND CHEERFUL TEMPER AND OBLIGING DISPOSITION WERE THE MOST ESSENTIAL REQUISITIES MY MOTHER DID NOT RELISH THIS AT ALL AND NOW MADE MANY OBJECTIONS TO MY ACCEPTING THE SITUATION
2090-151646-0036 IN WHICH MY SISTER WARMLY SUPPORTED HER BUT UNWILLING TO BE BALKED AGAIN I OVERRULED THEM ALL AND HAVING FIRST OBTAINED THE CONSENT OF MY FATHER WHO HAD A SHORT TIME PREVIOUSLY BEEN APPRISED OF THESE TRANSACTIONS
2090-151646-0037 I WROTE A MOST OBLIGING EPISTLE TO MY UNKNOWN CORRESPONDENT AND FINALLY THE BARGAIN WAS CONCLUDED IT WAS DECREED THAT ON THE LAST DAY OF JANUARY I WAS TO ENTER UPON MY NEW OFFICE AS GOVERNESS IN THE FAMILY OF MISTER MURRAY
2090-151646-0038 OF HORTON LODGE NEAR O ABOUT SEVENTY MILES FROM OUR VILLAGE A FORMIDABLE DISTANCE TO ME AS I HAD NEVER BEEN ABOVE TWENTY MILES FROM HOME IN ALL THE COURSE OF MY TWENTY YEARS SOJOURN ON EARTH AND AS MOREOVER
2090-151646-0039 EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN THAT FAMILY AND IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS UTTERLY UNKNOWN TO MYSELF AND ALL MY ACQUAINTANCES BUT THIS RENDERED IT ONLY THE MORE PIQUANT TO ME I HAD NOW IN SOME MEASURE
2090-151646-0040 THERE WAS A PLEASING EXCITEMENT IN THE IDEA OF ENTERING THESE UNKNOWN REGIONS AND MAKING MY WAY ALONE AMONG ITS STRANGE INHABITANTS I NOW FLATTERED MYSELF I WAS GOING TO SEE SOMETHING IN THE WORLD MISTER MURRAY'S RESIDENCE WAS NEAR A LARGE TOWN
2090-151646-0041 HIS RANK FROM WHAT I COULD GATHER APPEARED TO BE HIGHER THAN THAT OF MISTER BLOOMFIELD AND DOUBTLESS HE WAS ONE OF THOSE GENUINE THOROUGHBRED GENTRY MY MOTHER SPOKE OF WHO WOULD TREAT HIS GOVERNESS WITH DUE CONSIDERATION AS A RESPECTABLE WELL EDUCATED LADY
2090-151646-0042 THE INSTRUCTOR AND GUIDE OF HIS CHILDREN AND NOT A MERE UPPER SERVANT THEN MY PUPILS BEING OLDER WOULD BE MORE RATIONAL MORE TEACHABLE AND LESS TROUBLESOME THAN THE LAST THEY WOULD BE LESS CONFINED TO THE SCHOOLROOM
2090-151646-0043 AND FINALLY BRIGHT VISIONS MINGLED WITH MY HOPES WITH WHICH THE CARE OF CHILDREN AND THE MERE DUTIES OF A GOVERNESS HAD LITTLE OR NOTHING TO DO THUS THE READER WILL SEE THAT I HAD NO CLAIM TO BE REGARDED AS A MARTYR TO FILIAL PIETY
2090-151646-0044 GOING FORTH TO SACRIFICE PEACE AND LIBERTY FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF LAYING UP STORES FOR THE COMFORT AND SUPPORT OF MY PARENTS THOUGH CERTAINLY THE COMFORT OF MY FATHER AND THE FUTURE SUPPORT OF MY MOTHER
2090-151646-0045 HAD A LARGE SHARE IN MY CALCULATIONS AND FIFTY POUNDS APPEARED TO ME NO ORDINARY SUM I MUST HAVE DECENT CLOTHES BECOMING MY STATION I MUST IT SEEMED PUT OUT MY WASHING AND ALSO PAY FOR MY FOUR ANNUAL JOURNEYS BETWEEN HORTON LODGE AND HOME
2090-151646-0046 SURELY TWENTY POUNDS OR LITTLE MORE
