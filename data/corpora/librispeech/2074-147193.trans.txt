2074-147193-0001 FOR HER HUSBAND HAD FORGOTTEN HER AND LIVED FAR AWAY
2074-147193-0002 TO THE TEMPLE OF POSEIDON AND SIT THERE ALL DAY LOOKING OUT ACROSS THE BAY OVER METHANA
2074-147193-0003 AND THE ATTIC SHORE BEYOND AND WHEN THESEUS WAS FULL FIFTEEN YEARS OLD SHE TOOK HIM UP WITH HER TO THE TEMPLE AND INTO THE THICKETS OF THE GROVE WHICH GREW IN THE TEMPLE YARD
2074-147193-0004 AND SHE LED HIM TO A TALL PLANE TREE BENEATH WHOSE SHADE GREW ARBUTUS AND LENTISK AND PURPLE HEATHER BUSHES AND THERE SHE SIGHED AND SAID THESEUS MY SON GO INTO THAT THICKET
2074-147193-0005 AND YOU WILL FIND AT THE PLANE TREE FOOT A GREAT FLAT STONE LIFT IT AND BRING ME WHAT LIES UNDERNEATH THEN THESEUS PUSHED HIS WAY IN THROUGH THE THICK BUSHES
2074-147193-0006 AND SAW THAT THEY HAD NOT BEEN MOVED FOR MANY A YEAR AND SEARCHING AMONG THEIR ROOTS HE FOUND A GREAT FLAT STONE
2074-147193-0007 HE TRIED TO LIFT IT BUT HE COULD NOT AND HE TRIED TILL THE SWEAT RAN DOWN HIS BROW FROM HEAT AND THE TEARS FROM HIS EYES FOR SHAME BUT ALL WAS OF NO AVAIL
2074-147193-0008 AND AT LAST HE CAME BACK TO HIS MOTHER AND SAID I HAVE FOUND THE STONE BUT I CANNOT LIFT IT
2074-147193-0009 THEN SHE SIGHED AND SAID THE GODS WAIT LONG BUT THEY ARE JUST AT LAST LET IT BE FOR ANOTHER YEAR
2074-147193-0010 THEN SHE TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND WENT INTO THE TEMPLE AND PRAYED AND CAME DOWN AGAIN WITH THESEUS TO HER HOME AND WHEN A FULL YEAR WAS PAST SHE LED THESEUS UP AGAIN TO THE TEMPLE AND BADE HIM LIFT THE STONE

2074-147193-0012 AND HE LONGED TO ASK HIS MOTHER THE MEANING OF THAT STONE AND WHAT MIGHT LIE UNDERNEATH IT BUT HER FACE WAS SO SAD THAT HE HAD NOT THE HEART TO ASK SO HE SAID TO HIMSELF
2074-147193-0013 THE DAY SHALL SURELY COME WHEN I WILL LIFT THAT STONE
2074-147193-0014 AND IN ORDER TO GROW STRONG HE SPENT ALL HIS DAYS IN WRESTLING AND BOXING AND HURLING AND TAMING HORSES AND HUNTING THE BOAR AND THE BULL AND COURSING GOATS AND DEER AMONG THE ROCKS
2074-147193-0015 TILL UPON ALL THE MOUNTAINS THERE WAS NO HUNTER SO SWIFT AS THESEUS AND HE KILLED PHAIA THE WILD SOW OF CROMMYON WHICH WASTED ALL THE LAND TILL ALL THE PEOPLE SAID SURELY THE GODS ARE WITH THE LAD

2074-147193-0017 AND THESEUS WENT INTO THE THICKET AND STOOD OVER THE STONE AND TUGGED AT IT
2074-147193-0018 AND ROLLED IT OVER WITH A SHOUT AND WHEN HE LOOKED BENEATH IT ON THE GROUND LAY A SWORD OF BRONZE WITH A HILT OF GLITTERING GOLD AND BY IT A PAIR OF GOLDEN SANDALS
2074-147193-0019 AND HE CAUGHT THEM UP AND BURST THROUGH THE BUSHES LIKE A WILD BOAR AND LEAPT TO HIS MOTHER HOLDING THEM HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD BUT WHEN SHE SAW THEM SHE WEPT LONG IN SILENCE
2074-147193-0020 HIDING HER FAIR FACE IN HER SHAWL AND THESEUS STOOD BY HER WONDERING AND WEPT ALSO HE KNEW NOT WHY AND WHEN SHE WAS TIRED OF WEEPING SHE LIFTED UP HER HEAD
2074-147193-0021 AND LAID HER FINGER ON HER LIPS AND SAID HIDE THEM IN YOUR BOSOM THESEUS MY SON AND COME WITH ME WHERE WE CAN LOOK DOWN UPON THE SEA THEN THEY WENT OUTSIDE THE SACRED WALL
2074-147193-0022 AND LOOKED DOWN OVER THE BRIGHT BLUE SEA AND AITHRA SAID DO YOU SEE THIS LAND AT OUR FEET AND HE SAID YES THIS IS TROEZENE WHERE I WAS BORN AND BRED AND SHE SAID

2074-147193-0029 AND ALL THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS WHICH GIRDLE ATHENS ROUND BUT ATHENS ITSELF HE COULD NOT SEE
2074-147193-0030 MIDWAY ACROSS THE SEA THEN HIS HEART GREW GREAT WITHIN HIM AND HE SAID IF I WERE KING OF SUCH A LAND I WOULD RULE IT WISELY AND WELL IN WISDOM AND IN MIGHT
2074-147193-0031 THAT WHEN I DIED ALL MEN MIGHT WEEP OVER MY TOMB AND CRY ALAS FOR THE SHEPHERD OF HIS PEOPLE AND AITHRA SMILED AND SAID TAKE THEN THE SWORD AND THE SANDALS
