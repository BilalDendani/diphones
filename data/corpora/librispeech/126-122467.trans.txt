126-122467-0000 A FAMILY AFFAIR WAS NOT SUBJECT TO THE INVESTIGATION OF THE CARDINAL A FAMILY AFFAIR CONCERNED NOBODY PEOPLE MIGHT EMPLOY THEMSELVES IN A FAMILY AFFAIR BEFORE ALL THE WORLD
126-122467-0001 FAMILY AFFAIR ARAMIS HAD DISCOVERED THE IDEA THE LACKEYS PORTHOS HAD DISCOVERED THE MEANS THE DIAMOND D'ARTAGNAN ALONE HAD DISCOVERED NOTHING HE ORDINARILY THE MOST INVENTIVE OF THE FOUR
126-122467-0002 D'ARTAGNAN ALREADY WORE HIS UNIFORM FOR BEING NEARLY OF THE SAME SIZE AS ARAMIS AND AS ARAMIS WAS SO LIBERALLY PAID BY THE PUBLISHER WHO PURCHASED HIS POEM AS TO ALLOW HIM TO BUY EVERYTHING DOUBLE HE SOLD HIS FRIEND A COMPLETE OUTFIT
126-122467-0003 D'ARTAGNAN PASSED THE DAY IN EXHIBITING HIS MUSKETEER'S UNIFORM IN EVERY STREET OF THE CAMP IN THE EVENING AT THE APPOINTED HOUR THE FOUR FRIENDS MET THERE ONLY REMAINED THREE THINGS TO DECIDE
126-122467-0004 WHAT THEY SHOULD WRITE TO MILADY'S BROTHER WHAT THEY SHOULD WRITE TO THE CLEVER PERSON AT TOURS AND WHICH SHOULD BE THE LACKEYS TO CARRY THE LETTERS EVERYONE OFFERED HIS OWN
126-122467-0005 CONFIDING IN THE ADDRESS OF BAZIN MADE A POMPOUS EULOGIUM ON HIS CANDIDATE FINALLY D'ARTAGNAN HAD ENTIRE FAITH IN THE BRAVERY OF PLANCHET AND REMINDED THEM OF THE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD CONDUCTED HIMSELF
126-122467-0006 IN THE TICKLISH AFFAIR OF BOULOGNE THESE FOUR VIRTUES DISPUTED THE PRIZE FOR A LENGTH OF TIME AND GAVE BIRTH TO MAGNIFICENT SPEECHES WHICH WE DO NOT REPEAT HERE FOR FEAR THEY SHOULD BE DEEMED TOO LONG
126-122467-0007 UNFORTUNATELY SAID ATHOS HE WHOM WE SEND MUST POSSESS IN HIMSELF ALONE THE FOUR QUALITIES UNITED
126-122467-0008 PLANCHET IS BRAVE AND SHREWD THEY ARE TWO QUALITIES OUT OF THE FOUR GENTLEMEN SAID ARAMIS THE PRINCIPAL QUESTION IS NOT TO KNOW WHICH OF OUR FOUR LACKEYS IS THE MOST DISCREET THE MOST STRONG THE MOST CLEVER OR THE MOST BRAVE
126-122467-0009 THE PRINCIPAL THING IS TO KNOW WHICH LOVES MONEY THE BEST WHAT ARAMIS SAYS IS VERY SENSIBLE REPLIED ATHOS WE MUST SPECULATE UPON THE FAULTS OF PEOPLE AND NOT UPON THEIR VIRTUES MONSIEUR ABBE YOU ARE A GREAT MORALIST
126-122467-0010 DOUBTLESS SAID ARAMIS FOR WE NOT ONLY REQUIRE TO BE WELL SERVED IN ORDER TO SUCCEED BUT MOREOVER NOT TO FAIL FOR IN CASE OF FAILURE HEADS ARE IN QUESTION NOT FOR OUR LACKEYS
126-122467-0011 WELL MY DEAR FRIEND ADD TO HIS NATURAL DEVOTEDNESS A GOOD SUM OF MONEY AND THEN INSTEAD OF ANSWERING FOR HIM ONCE ANSWER FOR HIM TWICE
126-122467-0012 WHO WAS AN OPTIMIST WHEN THINGS WERE CONCERNED AND A PESSIMIST WHEN MEN WERE IN QUESTION THEY WILL PROMISE EVERYTHING FOR THE SAKE OF THE MONEY AND ON THE ROAD FEAR WILL PREVENT THEM FROM ACTING ONCE TAKEN THEY WILL BE PRESSED WHEN PRESSED THEY WILL CONFESS EVERYTHING
126-122467-0013 NOT AT ALL CRIED D'ARTAGNAN WHO WAS ANXIOUS THE MATTER SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED ON THE CONTRARY I THINK IT VERY EASY IT WOULD BE NO DOUBT PARBLEU IF WE WRITE TO LORD DE WINTER ABOUT AFFAIRS OF VAST IMPORTANCE OF THE HORRORS OF THE CARDINAL
126-122467-0014 MY LORD DO YOU REMEMBER THE LITTLE GOAT PASTURE OF THE LUXEMBOURG GOOD THE LUXEMBOURG ONE MIGHT BELIEVE THIS IS AN ALLUSION TO THE QUEEN MOTHER
126-122467-0015 MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN YOU WILL NEVER MAKE ANYTHING BUT A VERY BAD SECRETARY WHERE YOUR LIFE WAS SPARED FOR SHAME THAT'S UNWORTHY A MAN OF SPIRIT IS NOT TO BE REMINDED OF SUCH SERVICES
126-122467-0016 A BENEFIT REPROACHED IS AN OFFENSE COMMITTED THE DEVIL SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOU ARE INSUPPORTABLE IF THE LETTER MUST BE WRITTEN UNDER YOUR CENSURE MY FAITH I RENOUNCE THE TASK AND YOU WILL DO RIGHT HANDLE THE MUSKET AND THE SWORD MY DEAR FELLOW
126-122467-0017 BUT LET ME BE PROPERLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE SUBJECT
126-122467-0018 MADE A SIGN OF ASSENT TO D'ARTAGNAN WHO BY IT UNDERSTOOD HE WAS AT LIBERTY TO SPEAK WELL THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY SAID D'ARTAGNAN MY LORD YOUR SISTER IN LAW IS AN INFAMOUS WOMAN WHO WISHED TO HAVE YOU KILLED THAT SHE MIGHT INHERIT YOUR WEALTH
126-122467-0019 BUT SHE COULD NOT MARRY YOUR BROTHER BEING ALREADY MARRIED IN FRANCE AND HAVING BEEN
126-122467-0020 REPUDIATED BY HER HUSBAND SAID ATHOS BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN BRANDED CONTINUED D'ARTAGNAN BAH CRIED PORTHOS IMPOSSIBLE WHAT DO YOU SAY THAT SHE WANTED TO HAVE HER BROTHER IN LAW KILLED YES
126-122467-0021 SHE WAS MARRIED ASKED ARAMIS YES
126-122467-0022 D'ARTAGNAN AND I OR RATHER TO OBSERVE THE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER I AND D'ARTAGNAN
126-122467-0023 AND DOES THE HUSBAND OF THIS FRIGHTFUL CREATURE STILL LIVE SAID ARAMIS HE STILL LIVES ARE YOU QUITE SURE OF IT I AM HE
126-122467-0024 D'ARTAGNAN HAS GIVEN US AN EXCELLENT PROGRAM AND THE LETTER MUST BE WRITTEN AT ONCE THE DEVIL
126-122467-0025 AND IT IS A RATHER DIFFICULT MATTER THE CHANCELLOR HIMSELF WOULD BE PUZZLED HOW TO WRITE SUCH A LETTER AND YET THE CHANCELLOR DRAWS UP AN OFFICIAL REPORT VERY READILY NEVER MIND BE SILENT I WILL WRITE
126-122467-0026 ARAMIS ACCORDINGLY TOOK THE QUILL REFLECTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS WROTE EIGHT OR TEN LINES IN A CHARMING LITTLE FEMALE HAND AND THEN WITH A VOICE SOFT AND SLOW AS IF EACH WORD HAD BEEN SCRUPULOUSLY WEIGHED HE READ THE FOLLOWING MY LORD
126-122467-0027 THE PERSON WHO WRITES THESE FEW LINES HAD THE HONOR OF CROSSING SWORDS WITH YOU IN THE LITTLE ENCLOSURE
126-122467-0028 HE THINKS IT HIS DUTY TO RESPOND TO THAT FRIENDSHIP BY SENDING YOU IMPORTANT INFORMATION TWICE YOU HAVE NEARLY BEEN THE VICTIM OF A NEAR RELATIVE WHOM YOU BELIEVE TO BE YOUR HEIR BECAUSE YOU ARE IGNORANT THAT BEFORE SHE CONTRACTED A MARRIAGE IN ENGLAND SHE WAS ALREADY MARRIED IN FRANCE
126-122467-0029 BUT THE THIRD TIME WHICH IS THE PRESENT YOU MAY SUCCUMB YOUR RELATIVE LEFT LA ROCHELLE FOR ENGLAND DURING THE NIGHT WATCH HER ARRIVAL FOR SHE HAS GREAT AND TERRIBLE PROJECTS IF YOU REQUIRE TO KNOW POSITIVELY WHAT SHE IS CAPABLE OF
126-122467-0030 READ HER PAST HISTORY ON HER LEFT SHOULDER
126-122467-0031 MY DEAR ARAMIS YOU HAVE THE PEN OF A SECRETARY OF STATE LORD DE WINTER WILL NOW BE UPON HIS GUARD IF THE LETTER SHOULD REACH HIM AND EVEN IF IT SHOULD FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE CARDINAL WE SHALL NOT BE COMPROMISED
126-122467-0032 LET US GIVE HIM ONLY HALF THE SUM PROMISED HIM WITH THE LETTER WITH AN AGREEMENT THAT HE SHALL HAVE THE OTHER HALF IN EXCHANGE FOR THE REPLY
126-122467-0033 SEVEN THOUSAND LIVRES CRIED PORTHOS THAT POOR LITTLE DIAMOND WAS WORTH SEVEN THOUSAND LIVRES
126-122467-0034 I DON'T SUPPOSE THAT OUR FRIEND D'ARTAGNAN HAS ADDED ANY OF HIS OWN TO THE AMOUNT BUT GENTLEMEN IN ALL THIS SAID D'ARTAGNAN WE DO NOT THINK OF THE QUEEN LET US TAKE SOME HEED OF THE WELFARE OF HER DEAR BUCKINGHAM THAT IS THE LEAST WE OWE HER
126-122467-0035 WELL REPLIED THE LATTER BLUSHING WHAT MUST I SAY
126-122467-0036 HIS EMINENCE IS THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS POLITICIAN OF TIMES PAST OF TIMES PRESENT AND PROBABLY OF TIMES TO COME HE WOULD EXTINGUISH THE SUN IF THE SUN INCOMMODED HIM GIVE THESE HAPPY TIDINGS TO YOUR SISTER MY DEAR COUSIN
126-122467-0037 I HAVE DREAMED THAT THE UNLUCKY ENGLISHMAN WAS DEAD I CANNOT RECOLLECT WHETHER IT WAS BY STEEL OR BY POISON ONLY OF THIS I AM SURE I HAVE DREAMED HE WAS DEAD AND YOU KNOW MY DREAMS NEVER DECEIVE ME BE ASSURED THEN OF SEEING ME SOON RETURN
126-122467-0038 YOU SPEAK LIKE THE APOCALYPSE AND YOU ARE AS TRUE AS THE GOSPEL THERE IS NOTHING NOW TO DO BUT TO PUT THE ADDRESS TO THIS LETTER THAT IS EASILY DONE SAID ARAMIS HE FOLDED THE LETTER FANCIFULLY AND TOOK UP HIS PEN AND WROTE
126-122467-0039 AND PLACES CONFIDENCE IN NOBODY BUT HIM ANY OTHER PERSON WOULD FAIL BESIDES BAZIN IS AMBITIOUS AND LEARNED BAZIN HAS READ HISTORY GENTLEMEN HE KNOWS THAT SIXTUS THE FIFTH BECAME POPE AFTER HAVING KEPT PIGS
126-122467-0040 MILADY HAD HIM ONE DAY TURNED OUT OF DOORS WITH SUNDRY BLOWS OF A GOOD STICK TO ACCELERATE HIS MOTIONS NOW PLANCHET HAS AN EXCELLENT MEMORY AND I WILL BE BOUND THAT SOONER THAN RELINQUISH ANY POSSIBLE MEANS OF VENGEANCE HE WILL ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE BEATEN TO DEATH
126-122467-0041 IF YOUR ARRANGEMENTS AT TOURS ARE YOUR ARRANGEMENTS ARAMIS THOSE OF LONDON ARE MINE I REQUEST THEN THAT PLANCHET MAY BE CHOSEN MORE PARTICULARLY AS HE HAS ALREADY BEEN TO LONDON WITH ME AND KNOWS HOW TO SPEAK CORRECTLY
126-122467-0042 THAT WILL REDUCE THE SUM TO FIVE THOUSAND LIVRES
126-122467-0043 UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF MONSIEUR ABBE HERE FOR EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS OR COMMON WANTS WILL THAT DO
126-122467-0044 HE IS ACCUSTOMED TO MY WAYS AND I AM PARTICULAR YESTERDAY'S AFFAIR MUST HAVE SHAKEN HIM A LITTLE HIS VOYAGE WOULD UPSET HIM QUITE PLANCHET WAS SENT FOR AND INSTRUCTIONS WERE GIVEN HIM THE MATTER HAD BEEN NAMED TO HIM BY D'ARTAGNAN WHO IN THE FIRST PLACE POINTED OUT THE MONEY TO HIM
126-122467-0045 THEN THE GLORY AND THEN THE DANGER
126-122467-0046 THEN MONSIEUR SAID PLANCHET YOU MUST BUY ME A WATCH
126-122467-0047 AND BE A GOOD LAD REMEMBER IF YOU TALK IF YOU BABBLE IF YOU GET DRUNK YOU RISK YOUR MASTER'S HEAD WHO HAS SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN YOUR FIDELITY AND WHO ANSWERS FOR YOU
126-122467-0048 BUT REMEMBER ALSO THAT IF BY YOUR FAULT ANY EVIL HAPPENS TO D'ARTAGNAN I WILL FIND YOU WHEREVER YOU MAY BE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RIPPING UP YOUR BELLY
126-122467-0049 HUMILIATED BY THE SUSPICION AND MOREOVER TERRIFIED AT THE CALM AIR OF THE MUSKETEER AND I SAID PORTHOS ROLLING HIS LARGE EYES REMEMBER I WILL SKIN YOU ALIVE AH MONSIEUR
126-122467-0050 AND I SAID ARAMIS WITH HIS SOFT MELODIUS VOICE REMEMBER THAT I WILL ROAST YOU AT A SLOW FIRE LIKE A SAVAGE AH MONSIEUR PLANCHET BEGAN TO WEEP
126-122467-0051 WE WILL NOT VENTURE TO SAY WHETHER IT WAS FROM TERROR CREATED BY THE THREATS OR FROM TENDERNESS AT SEEING FOUR FRIENDS SO CLOSELY UNITED D'ARTAGNAN TOOK HIS HAND
126-122467-0052 THESE GENTLEMEN ONLY SAY THIS OUT OF AFFECTION FOR ME BUT AT BOTTOM THEY ALL LIKE YOU AH MONSIEUR SAID PLANCHET I WILL SUCCEED OR I WILL CONSENT TO BE CUT IN QUARTERS AND IF THEY DO CUT ME IN QUARTERS BE ASSURED THAT NOT A MORSEL OF ME WILL SPEAK
126-122467-0053 IN THE MORNING AS HE WAS MOUNTING HIS HORSE D'ARTAGNAN WHO FELT AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART A PARTIALITY FOR THE DUKE TOOK PLANCHET ASIDE
126-122467-0054 YOU WILL FURTHER SAY TO HIM WATCH OVER HIS GRACE LORD BUCKINGHAM FOR THEY WISH TO ASSASSINATE HIM BUT THIS PLANCHET IS SO SERIOUS AND IMPORTANT THAT I HAVE NOT INFORMED MY FRIENDS THAT I WOULD ENTRUST THIS SECRET TO YOU AND FOR A CAPTAIN'S COMMISSION I WOULD NOT WRITE IT
126-122467-0055 YOU SHALL SEE IF CONFIDENCE CAN BE PLACED IN ME MOUNTED ON AN EXCELLENT HORSE WHICH HE WAS TO LEAVE AT THE END OF TWENTY LEAGUES IN ORDER TO TAKE THE POST
126-122467-0056 THE FOUR FRIENDS DURING THE PERIOD OF THESE TWO ABSENCES HAD AS MAY WELL BE SUPPOSED THE EYE ON THE WATCH THE NOSE TO THE WIND AND THE EAR ON THE HARK
126-122467-0057 AND IN LOOKING OUT FOR ALL THE COURIERS WHO ARRIVED MORE THAN ONCE AN INVOLUNTARY TREMBLING SEIZED THEM WHEN CALLED UPON FOR SOME UNEXPECTED SERVICE THEY HAD BESIDES TO LOOK CONSTANTLY TO THEIR OWN PROPER SAFETY
126-122467-0058 DID NOT ALLOW THEM TO SLEEP VERY QUIETLY
126-122467-0059 AND SMILING ACCORDING TO CUSTOM ENTERED THE CABARET OF THE PARPAILLOT AS THE FOUR FRIENDS WERE SITTING DOWN TO BREAKFAST SAYING AS HAD BEEN AGREED UPON
126-122467-0060 IF SHE IS AS GREAT A LADY AS HER WRITING IS LARGE YOU ARE A LUCKY FELLOW GOMRADE
126-122467-0061 MY COUSIN MY SISTER AND I ARE SKILLFUL IN INTERPRETING DREAMS AND EVEN ENTERTAIN GREAT FEAR OF THEM BUT OF YOURS IT MAY BE SAID I HOPE EVERY DREAM IS AN ILLUSION ADIEU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
126-122467-0062 AND ACT SO THAT WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME HEAR YOU SPOKEN OF MARIE MICHON AND WHAT DREAM DOES SHE MEAN ASKED THE DRAGOON WHO HAD APPROACHED DURING THE READING YEZ WHAT'S THE DREAM SAID THE SWISS
126-122467-0063 IT WAS ONLY THIS I HAD A DREAM AND I RELATED IT TO HER YEZ YEZ SAID THE SWISS IT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH TO DELL A DREAM BUT I NEFFER DREAM
126-122467-0064 NEFFER
126-122467-0065 NEFFER NEFFER
126-122467-0066 PORTHOS AND ARAMIS REMAINED BEHIND TO ENCOUNTER THE JOKES OF THE DRAGOON AND THE SWISS AS TO BAZIN HE WENT AND LAY DOWN ON A TRUSS OF STRAW AND AS HE HAD MORE IMAGINATION THAN THE SWISS HE DREAMED THAT ARAMIS HAVING BECOME POPE
126-122467-0067 ADORNED HIS HEAD WITH A CARDINAL'S HAT BUT AS WE HAVE SAID BAZIN HAD NOT BY HIS FORTUNATE RETURN REMOVED MORE THAN A PART OF THE UNEASINESS WHICH WEIGHED UPON THE FOUR FRIENDS THE DAYS OF EXPECTATION ARE LONG
126-122467-0068 AND D'ARTAGNAN IN PARTICULAR WOULD HAVE WAGERED THAT THE DAYS WERE FORTY FOUR HOURS HE FORGOT THE NECESSARY SLOWNESS OF NAVIGATION HE EXAGGERATED TO HIMSELF THE POWER OF MILADY
126-122467-0069 HE CREDITED THIS WOMAN WHO APPEARED TO HIM THE EQUAL OF A DEMON WITH AGENTS AS SUPERNATURAL AS HERSELF AT THE LEAST NOISE HE IMAGINED HIMSELF ABOUT TO BE ARRESTED AND THAT PLANCHET WAS BEING BROUGHT BACK TO BE CONFRONTED WITH HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS
126-122467-0070 STILL FURTHER HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE WORTHY PICARD AT ONE TIME SO GREAT DIMINISHED DAY BY DAY
126-122467-0071 AND AS IF HE BREATHED HIS CUSTOMARY ATMOSPHERE ON THE SIXTEENTH DAY IN PARTICULAR THESE SIGNS WERE SO STRONG IN D'ARTAGNAN AND HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT THEY COULD NOT REMAIN QUIET IN ONE PLACE AND WANDERED ABOUT LIKE GHOSTS ON THE ROAD BY WHICH PLANCHET WAS EXPECTED
126-122467-0072 TO LET A WOMAN TERRIFY YOU SO AND WHAT DOES IT AMOUNT TO AFTER ALL TO BE IMPRISONED WELL BUT WE SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT OF PRISON MADAME BONACIEUX WAS RELEASED
126-122467-0073 WHO APPEARS TO ME TO BE A VERY GOOD LAD BUT IF HE DOES NOT COME SAID D'ARTAGNAN WELL IF HE DOES NOT COME IT WILL BE BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN DELAYED THAT'S ALL HE MAY HAVE FALLEN FROM HIS HORSE HE MAY HAVE CUT A CAPER FROM THE DECK
126-122467-0074 LIFE IS A CHAPLET OF LITTLE MISERIES WHICH THE PHILOSOPHER COUNTS WITH A SMILE BE PHILOSOPHERS AS I AM GENTLEMEN SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE AND LET US DRINK
126-122467-0075 THAT'S ALL VERY WELL REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN BUT I AM TIRED OF FEARING WHEN I OPEN A FRESH BOTTLE THAT THE WINE MAY COME FROM THE CELLAR OF MILADY
126-122467-0076 SUCH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN A WOMAN OF MARK SAID PORTHOS WITH HIS LOUD LAUGH
126-122467-0077 AND ROSE IN HIS TURN WITH A NERVOUS MOVEMENT HE COULD NOT REPRESS THE DAY HOWEVER PASSED AWAY AND THE EVENING CAME ON SLOWLY BUT FINALLY IT CAME THE BARS WERE FILLED WITH DRINKERS
126-122467-0078 A PARTNER WORTHY OF HIS COMPANY THEY WERE PLAYING TOGETHER AS USUAL WHEN SEVEN O'CLOCK SOUNDED THE PATROL WAS HEARD PASSING TO DOUBLE THE POSTS AT HALF PAST SEVEN THE RETREAT WAS SOUNDED WE ARE LOST SAID D'ARTAGNAN IN THE EAR OF ATHOS
126-122467-0079 QUIETLY DRAWING FOUR PISTOLES FROM HIS POCKET AND THROWING THEM UPON THE TABLE COME GENTLEMEN SAID HE THEY ARE BEATING THE TATTOO LET US TO BED AND ATHOS WENT OUT OF THE PARPAILLOT FOLLOWED BY D'ARTAGNAN ARAMIS CAME BEHIND GIVING HIS ARM TO PORTHOS
126-122467-0080 ARAMIS MUMBLED VERSES TO HIMSELF AND PORTHOS FROM TIME TO TIME PULLED A HAIR OR TWO FROM HIS MUSTACHE IN SIGN OF DESPAIR BUT ALL AT ONCE A SHADOW APPEARED IN THE DARKNESS THE OUTLINE OF WHICH WAS FAMILIAR TO D'ARTAGNAN AND A WELL KNOWN VOICE SAID
126-122467-0081 AND HE RESTRAINED HIMSELF I HAVE THE NOTE
126-122467-0082 AND OPENED THE SO ANXIOUSLY EXPECTED LETTER IT CONTAINED HALF A LINE IN A HAND PERFECTLY BRITISH AND WITH A CONCISENESS AS PERFECTLY SPARTAN THANK YOU BE EASY D'ARTAGNAN TRANSLATED THIS FOR THE OTHERS
126-122467-0083 AND DID NOT LET GO TILL IT WAS REDUCED TO A CINDER THEN CALLING PLANCHET HE SAID NOW MY LAD YOU MAY CLAIM YOUR SEVEN HUNDRED LIVRES
126-122467-0084 WELL CRIED D'ARTAGNAN TELL US ALL ABOUT IT
126-122467-0085 AND ME TOO SAID D'ARTAGNAN AND ME TOO SAID PORTHOS AND ME TOO SAID ARAMIS
