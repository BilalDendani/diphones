7463-96494-0000 THE STAGNANT WORLD SMITH ENTERED THE MIND OF HIS CAPELLAN AGENT AT A MOMENT WHEN HE WAS CLEARLY OFF DUTY IN FACT THE ENGINEER OF THE COBULUS WAS AT THE TIME ENJOYING AN UNCOMMONLY GOOD PHOTOPLAY
7463-96494-0001 SMITH HAD ARRIVED TOO LATE TO SEE THE BEGINNING OF THE PICTURE BUT HE FOUND IT TO BE A MORE OR LESS CONVENTIONAL SOCIETY DRAMA AND FOR A WHILE HE WAS MAINLY INTERESTED IN THE REMARKABLY CLEAR PHOTOGRAPHY
7463-96494-0002 THE NATURAL COLORING AND STEREOSCOPIC EFFECT THAT THE DOCTOR HAD ALREADY NOTED THROUGH YOUNG ERNOL SMITH NEARLY OVERLOOKED THE REALLY FINE MUSIC ALL COMING FROM A TALKING MACHINE OF SOME KIND AND THEN THE PICTURE CAME TO AN END AND A FARCE COMEDY BEGAN
7463-96494-0003 IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY INGENIOUS THING WITH LITTLE OR NO PLOT AFTERWARD SMITH COULD NOT DESCRIBE IT WITH ANY ACCURACY HOWEVER MISSUS KINNEY DOWN STAIRS PLAINLY HEARD HIM LAUGHING AS THOUGH HIS SIDES WOULD GIVE WAY
7463-96494-0004 THE PICTURE OVER SMITH'S MAN GOT UP AND LEFT THE PLACE AND ONCE OUTSIDE HE GLANCED AT HIS WATCH AND TOOK UP A POSITION ON THE CURB MUCH AS SMITH HAD OFTEN DONE WHEN A YOUNGER MAN THE CAPELLAN SEEMED TO KNOW A GOOD MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT OF THE PLAYHOUSE
7463-96494-0005 AND MEANWHILE SMITH TOOK NOTE OF SOMETHING OF EXTREME IMPORTANCE THE PLAYHOUSE DID NOT HAVE ANY ADVERTISING WHATEVER IN SIGHT EXCEPT FOR A SINGLE BULLETIN BOARD LIKE THE BILL OF FARE OF A CAFETERIA MOREOVER
7463-96494-0006 AND THIS IS THE SIGNIFICANT THING THERE WAS NO BOX OFFICE NEITHER WAS ANY ONE AT THE DOOR TO TAKE TICKETS THE PLACE WAS WIDE OPEN TO THE WORLD IT WAS LOCATED ON A VERY BUSY STREET IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE A GOOD SIZED CITY
7463-96494-0007 BUT TO ALL APPEARANCES ANY ONE MIGHT ENTER WHO CHOSE TO FREE AMUSEMENTS THOUGHT SMITH TO KEEP THE BOOBS HAPPY SHORTLY HIS AGENT STEPPED DOWN THE STREET WHICH SEEMED TO BE GREATLY LIKE ONE IN ANY CITY ON THE EARTH
7463-96494-0008 EXCEPT THAT THERE WAS REMARKABLY LITTLE NOISE
7463-96494-0009 CERTAINLY THE SPACE BETWEEN THE SIDEWALKS WAS USED FOR LITTLE ELSE THAN THE PARKING OF FLYING MACHINES THE BUILDINGS HOUSED A VARIETY OF STORES ALL BUILT ON A LARGE SCALE
7463-96494-0010 SMITH'S AGENT QUICKLY REACHED HIS OWN FLIER A SMALL TWO SEATER ORNITHOPTER FINISHED IN DULL GRAY SMITH'S FAVORITE COLOR INCIDENTALLY AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO HE WAS WELL UNDER WAY
7463-96494-0011 SMITH HAD A CHANCE TO WATCH AT CLOSE RANGE THE DISTORTED S MOTION OF THE MACHINE'S WINGS BUT THE FLIGHT LASTED ONLY A FEW MINUTES AND PRESENTLY THE CRAFT WAS AGAIN AT REST THIS TIME IT WAS PARKED UNDER A TREMENDOUSLY LONG SHED
7463-96494-0012 WHICH SMITH AFTERWARD SAW WAS REALLY A BALCONY ONE OF A TIER OF TEN OPPOSITE THE SPOT WAS A LARGE BUILDING LIKE A DEPOT AND OVER ITS ROOF SMITH SAW THE HUGE BULK OF AN AIRSHIP
7463-96494-0013 IT WAS OF COURSE THE COBULUS AND IT WAS WHEN SMITH'S AGENT PASSED THROUGH A CHECKING IN ROOM THAT HIS NAME WAS HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME
7463-96494-0014 AND REBLONG WITH SMITH MAKING EAGER USE OF HIS EYES WENT DIRECTLY THROUGH A HATCH IN THE SIDE OF THE GREAT SHIP AND THENCE DOWN A CORRIDOR TO HIS ENGINE ROOM SMITH GOT LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THE MACHINERY REBLONG GAVE THE PLACE A SINGLE SWEEPING GLANCE
7463-96494-0015 THEN STRODE TO A SHORT BLACK BEARDED CHAP WHO STOOD NEAR THE INSTRUMENT BOARD EVERYTHING AS USUAL MY FRIEND HE HAD A PLEASANT VOICE AS SMITH LEARNED FOR THE FIRST TIME YES AS USUAL THE MAN'S VOICE WAS BITTER THAT'S JUST WHAT'S WRONG
7463-96494-0016 THERE'S NEVER ANY IMPROVEMENT IT'S ALWAYS AS USUAL SAY REBLONG NO OFFENSE BUT I THINK WE ARE FOOLS TO PUT UP WITH WHAT WE ARE GIVEN
7463-96494-0017 PERSONALLY I THINK WE ARE MIGHTY LUCKY INSTEAD OF FOOLISH LUCKY THE OTHER MAN SNORTED
7463-96494-0018 I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM AROUND FOR WEEKS DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WITH SOME UNEASINESS HE WENT BACK TO CALASTIA AND THAT'S THE LAST I HEARD OF HIM CALASTIA
7463-96494-0019 ALL NEWS CUT OFF THE MAN INSTANTLY SMELLED A MOUSE QUARANTINE WHY SHOULD THAT CAUSE THE NEWS TO BE CUT OFF THERE'S SOMETHING MORE THAN QUARANTINE THE MATTER REBLONG
7463-96494-0020 HE BEGAN TO PACE THE ROOM EXCITEDLY I SAY IT AGAIN WE'RE FOOLS TO BELIEVE EVERYTHING THE COMMISSION TELLS US I THINK THEY'VE BEEN HOODWINKING US ABOUT LONG ENOUGH REBLONG SUPPRESSED A YAWN
7463-96494-0021 AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S THE MATTER CRIED THE OTHER
7463-96494-0022 YES POLITELY MAYBE SO ONLY YOU CAN'T BLAME US FOR THINKING PRETTY HIGHLY OF A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS DONE THIS REBLONG CHECKED THE ITEMS OFF ON HIS FINGERS
7463-96494-0023 IT HAS DONE AWAY WITH THE LIQUOR TRAFFIC IT HAS FULLY PROTECTED WOMEN IN INDUSTRY IT HAS PUT AN END TO CHILD LABOR IT HAS ABOLISHED POVERTY IT HAS ABOLISHED WAR AND WITH CONSIDERABLE EMPHASIS FOR SO QUIET A MAN
7463-96494-0024 IT HAS PROVIDED YOU AND ME AND EVERYBODY ELSE WITH A MIGHTY FINE EDUCATION FREE OF CHARGE REBLONG'S MANNER BY ITS VERY EMPHASIS HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING THE OTHER MAN SUDDENLY QUITE COOL CORRECT
7463-96494-0025 I ADMIT THEM ALL AND AT THE SAME TIME I WANT TO SHOW YOU THAT THE COMMISSION HAS ACCOMPLISHED ALL THIS NOT PRIMARILY FOR OUR BENEFIT BUT IN THE INTERESTS OF THE OWNERS THEY GAVE US PROHIBITION BECAUSE DRINKING WAS BAD FOR BUSINESS
7463-96494-0026 NO OTHER REASON REBLONG AND THAT'S WHY THE WOMEN ARE PROTECTED TOO A PROTECTED CONTENTED WOMAN BRINGS IN BETTER DIVIDENDS TO THE OWNERS THAN ONE WHO IS WORKED TO DEATH NEITHER DID IT PAY TO ALLOW CHILD LABOR IT RESULTED IN MISERY
7463-96494-0027 AND REDUCED PRODUCTION IN THE LONG RUN AND THAT MEANT REDUCED DIVIDENDS POVERTY DIDN'T PAY EITHER POOR PEOPLE DO NOT MAKE EFFICIENT WORKMEN WAR WAS ABOLISHED REBLONG NOT FOR ANY HUMANITARIAN MOTIVES
7463-96494-0028 BUT BECAUSE PEACE BROUGHT IN FATTER PROFITS AND LESS WASTE AND AS FOR OUR COMPULSORY EDUCATION HE SNAPPED HIS FINGERS CONTEMPTUOUSLY JUST WHAT DOES IT AMOUNT TO SIMPLY THIS IT DIDN'T PAY THE OWNERS TO ALLOW ILLITERACY
7463-96494-0029 AN EDUCATED WORKMAN IS A BETTER DIVIDEND PRODUCER THAN AN IGNORANT ONE THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT REBLONG DON'T FOOL YOURSELF INTO THINKING THAT THE COMMISSION HAS DONE ALL THIS FOR YOUR BENEFIT NOT MUCH MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT CONCEDED REBLONG
7463-96494-0030 I'M SATISFIED THE OTHER MAN LOOKED DISGUSTED SATISFIED JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE GUARANTEED YOUR DOLLAR AN HOUR AND YOUR PENSION AT SIXTY SATISFIED WHEN HALF THE COMPANY'S PROFITS GO TO THE OWNERS
7463-96494-0031 NOT ONE OF WHOM EVER DID A BIT OF WORK IN HIS LIFE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOTHING BUT BLOW IN THE MONEY WE EARN AND SPEND MORE IN A DAY THAN WE DO IN A MONTH THEY'RE WELCOME COMMENTED REBLONG WITH MUCH INDIFFERENCE
7463-96494-0032 YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU'VE SWALLOWED THAT OLD PIFFLE SAID THE BLACK BEARDED CHAP INCREDULOUSLY I DON'T SEE ANY PIFFLE ABOUT IT
7463-96494-0033 NOT ONLY DO THEY TAKE THE BURDEN OF OUR SURPLUS EARNINGS OFF OUR SHOULDERS BUT THEY RUN OUR GOVERNMENT FOR US WITHOUT CHARGE WELL I'LL BE UTTERLY DAMNED THE OTHER FELLOW LOOKED AS THOUGH THE WORDS WERE NOT HALF STRONG ENOUGH
7463-96494-0034 I NEVER THOUGHT A FULL GROWN MAN COULD CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE STUFF WE WERE TAUGHT WHEN WE WERE KIDS DON'T YOU EVER THINK FOR YOURSELF REBLONG WHY LOOK HERE HE CAME CLOSER AND SPOKE WITH PAINSTAKING CLEARNESS
7463-96494-0035 AS THOUGH HE WERE ADDRESSING A CHILD THE COMMISSION INSTEAD OF ASSURING US THAT INCREASED WAGES WOULD BE OUR RUIN COULD JUST AS WELL BE EDUCATING US TO SPEND WISELY
7463-96494-0036 EVERY LAST ONE OF US OUGHT TO BE GIVEN A COLLEGE EDUCATION INSTEAD OF MERELY THE CHILDREN OF THE RICH AND ALL THIS COULD BE DONE TOO THERE'S NO EARTHLY REASON WHY WE SHOULD PERMIT THAT BUNCH OF PARASITES IN HAFEN TO GRAFT OFF US ANY LONGER
7463-96494-0037 PUT EM TO WORK LIKE YOU AND ME AND MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR US ALL BUT OBJECTED REBLONG A LITTLE UPSET THERE'S ONLY A FEW OF THE OWNERS THEY COULDN'T HELP MUCH BUT THEIR SERVANTS COULD
7463-96494-0038 DO YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S TEN SERVANTS ON AN AVERAGE TO EVERY FAMILY OF THE RICH SERVANTS WHO DO NOTHING BUT MAKE LIFE STILL EASIER FOR PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HOG IT ALL WELL SUPPOSE THEY DID ALL GO TO WORK
7463-96494-0039 WHO WOULD RUN OUR GOVERNMENT FOR US MY FRIEND WHO WHY IF WE CAN DO THE WORK I GUESS WE CAN CERTAINLY DO THE GOVERNING REBLONG REBLONG TURNED AWAY
7463-96494-0040 SOMEWHERE A WARNING INSTRUMENT WAS THRUMMING LOUDLY THE MAN WITH THE DEMOCRATIC IDEAS AUTOMATICALLY TURNED TO HIS LOCKER AND PROCEEDED TO CHANGE HIS OUTER CLOTHING REBLONG MEANWHILE TOOK OFF HIS SUIT AND SLIPPED INTO SOME FULL LENGTH OVERALLS
7463-96494-0041 AS HE BUTTONED THEM UP AROUND THE NECK HE STEPPED IN FRONT OF A GLASS SMITH WAS NEARLY FLOORED THE MAN WAS ALMOST HIS EXACT DOUBLE AN ORDINARY EVERYDAY SORT OF A CHAP WITH A VERY COMMONPLACE FACE
7463-96494-0042 PERHAPS LIKE SMITH'S HIS FACE CONCEALED A REMARKABLE TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE BUT NOBODY WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM A SECOND GLANCE WAS HE THOUGHT SMITH A TYPICAL CAPELLAN WORKMAN
7463-96494-0043 THE OTHER MAN WAS READY TO GO HE HESITATED STUDYING THE FLOOR THEN SAID REGRETFULLY THE WORST PART OF IT IS REBLONG EVERYBODY I TALK TO IS AS BAD AS YOU ARE
7463-96494-0044 THEY ALL ADMIT THAT THINGS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE BUT NOBODY CARES HE WENT TO THE DOOR AND REBLONG HEARD HIM SAY UNDER HIS BREATH AS HE TURNED THE KNOB GREAT HEAVENS
