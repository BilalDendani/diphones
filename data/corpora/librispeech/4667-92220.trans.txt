4667-92220-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT TUPPENNY TRAVELS IN LONDON
4667-92220-0001 THIS SOUNDS LIKE A REASONABLE AND SENSIBLE STATEMENT YET THE MOMENT IT IS MADE I RETRACT IT AS QUITE MISLEADING AND ALTOGETHER TOO GENERAL
4667-92220-0002 AND BEGS US TO CONDUCT HIM THERE ON THE VERY NEXT SATURDAY ANOTHER HAS NOT SEEN WESTMINSTER ABBEY FOR FIFTEEN YEARS BECAUSE HE ATTENDS CHURCH AT SAINT DUNSTAN'S IN THE EAST ANOTHER SAYS THAT HE SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE US READ UP LONDON IN THE RED COVERED BAEDEKER
4667-92220-0003 AND THEN SHOW IT TO HIM PROPERLY AND SYSTEMATICALLY
4667-92220-0004 BUT THAT HE THINKS IT WOULD BE RATHER JOLLY
4667-92220-0005 WE THINK WE GET A KIND OF VAGUE APPREHENSION OF WHAT LONDON MEANS FROM THE TOP OF A BUS BETTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE AND THIS VAGUE APPREHENSION IS AS MUCH AS THE THOUGHTFUL OR IMAGINATIVE OBSERVER WILL EVER ARRIVE AT IN A LIFETIME
4667-92220-0006 IT IS TOO STUPENDOUS TO BE COMPREHENDED THE MIND IS DAZED BY ITS DISTANCES CONFUSED BY ITS CONTRASTS TOSSED FROM THE SPECTACLE OF ITS WEALTH TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF ITS POVERTY
4667-92220-0007 THE BRILLIANCY OF ITS EXTRAVAGANCES TO THE STOLIDITY OF ITS MISERIES THE LUXURIES THAT BLOSSOM IN MAYFAIR TO THE BRUTALITIES THAT LURK IN WHITECHAPEL
4667-92220-0008 SALEMINA AND I AND TRAVEL TWENTY MILES IN THE DAY
4667-92220-0009 WE NEVER KNOW WHITHER WE ARE GOING AND INDEED IT IS NOT A MATTER OF GREAT MOMENT I MEAN TO A WOMAN WHERE EVERYTHING IS NEW AND STRANGE AND WHERE THE DRIVER
4667-92220-0010 TELLS ONE EVERYTHING OF INTEREST ALONG THE WAY
4667-92220-0011 WE HAVE OUR FAVOURITE BUSES OF COURSE BUT WHEN ONE APPEARS AND WE JUMP ON WHILE IT IS STILL IN MOTION AS THE CONDUCTOR SEEMS TO PREFER AND PULL OURSELVES UP THE CORK SCREW STAIRWAY NOT A SIMPLE MATTER IN THE GARMENTS OF SOPHISTICATION
4667-92220-0012 WE LIKE THE CADBURY'S COCOA BUS VERY MUCH IT TAKES YOU BY SAINT MARY LE STRAND BOW BELLS THE TEMPLE
4667-92220-0013 EAT BLACK PUDDING AND DRINK PALE ALE SIT IN DOCTOR JOHNSON'S OLD SEAT AND PUT YOUR HEAD AGAINST THE EXACT SPOT ON THE WALL WHERE HIS RESTED
4667-92220-0014 ALL IS NOVEL AND ALL IS INTERESTING
4667-92220-0015 TRAVERSED BY THE DAVIES PEA FED BACON BUSES OR WHETHER YOU RIDE TO THE VERY OUTSKIRTS OF LONDON THROUGH GREEN FIELDS AND HEDGEROWS BY THE RIDGE'S FOOD OR NESTLE'S MILK ROUTE THERE ARE TRAMS TOO WHICH TAKE ONE TO DELIGHTFUL PLACES
4667-92220-0016 THOUGH THE SEATS ON TOP EXTEND LENGTHWISE AFTER THE OLD KNIFEBOARD PATTERN AND ONE DOES NOT GET SO GOOD A VIEW OF THE COUNTRY AS FROM THE GARDEN SEATS ON THE ROOF OF THE OMNIBUS
4667-92220-0017 STILL THERE IS NOTHING WE LIKE BETTER ON A WARM MORNING THAN A GOOD OUTING ON THE VINOLIA TRAM THAT WE PICK UP IN SHAFTESBURY AVENUE
4667-92220-0018 ONE OF THE DOZENS OF HAMLETS SWALLOWED UP BY THE GREAT MAW OF LONDON AND IT STILL LOOKS LIKE A HAMLET ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN ABSORBED FOR MANY YEARS WE CONSTANTLY HAPPEN ON THESE ABSORBED VILLAGES FROM WHICH NOT A CENTURY AGO PEOPLE DROVE UP TO TOWN IN THEIR COACHES
4667-92220-0019 IF YOU WISH TO SEE ANOTHER PHASE OF LIFE GO OUT ON A SATURDAY EVENING FROM NINE O'CLOCK ON TO ELEVEN STARTING ON A BEECHAM'S PILL BUS AND KEEP TO THE POORER DISTRICTS
4667-92220-0020 IT IS A MARKET NIGHT AND THE STREETS WILL BE A MOVING MASS OF MEN AND WOMEN BUYING AT THE HUCKSTERS STALLS EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE SOLD AT A STALL IS THERE FRUIT VEGETABLES MEAT FISH CROCKERY TIN WARE CHILDREN'S CLOTHING CHEAP TOYS
4667-92220-0021 BOOTS SHOES AND SUN BONNETS ALL IN RECKLESS CONFUSION THE VENDORS CRY THEIR WARES IN STENTORIAN TONES VYING WITH ONE ANOTHER TO PRODUCE EXCITEMENT AND INDUCE PATRONAGE WHILE GAS JETS ARE STREAMING INTO THE AIR FROM THE ROOFS
4667-92220-0022 AND FLARING FROM THE SIDES OF THE STALLS CHILDREN CRYING CHILDREN DANCING TO THE STRAINS OF AN ACCORDION CHILDREN QUARRELLING CHILDREN SCRAMBLING FOR THE REFUSE FRUIT IN THE MIDST OF THIS SPECTACLE THIS DIN AND UPROAR
4667-92220-0023 THE WOMEN ARE CHAFFERING AND BARGAINING QUITE CALMLY WATCHING THE SCALES TO SEE THAT THEY GET THEIR FULL PENNYWORTH OR SIXPENNYWORTH OF THIS OR THAT
4667-92220-0024 TO THE STUDENT OF FACES OF MANNERS OF VOICES OF GESTURES TO THE PERSON WHO SEES UNWRITTEN AND UNWRITABLE STORIES IN ALL THESE GROUPS OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN THE SCENE REVEALS MANY THINGS SOME COMEDIES MANY TRAGEDIES A FEW PLAIN NARRATIVES
4667-92220-0025 THANK GOD AND NOW AND THEN ONLY NOW AND THEN A ROMANCE AS TO THE DARK ALLEYS AND TENEMENTS ON THE FRINGE OF THIS GLARE AND BRILLIANT CONFUSION THIS BABEL OF SOUND AND ANT BED OF MOVING LIFE ONE CAN ONLY SURMISE AND PITY AND SHUDDER
4667-92220-0026 OR ONE COULD NEVER SLEEP FOR THINKING OF IT YET NOT TOO TIGHTLY LEST ONE SLEEP TOO SOUNDLY AND FORGET ALTOGETHER THE SEAMY SIDE OF THINGS
4667-92220-0027 AND STANDS ON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE OR WALKS ALONG THE THAMES EMBANKMENT THE LIGHTS OF PARLIAMENT HOUSE GLEAM FROM A HUNDRED WINDOWS AND IN THE DARK SHADOWS BY THE BANKS THOUSANDS OF COLOURED DISCS OF LIGHT TWINKLE AND DANCE AND GLOW LIKE FAIRY LAMPS
4667-92220-0028 AND ARE REFLECTED IN THE SILVER SURFACE OF THE RIVER THAT RIVER AS FULL OF MYSTERY AND CONTRAST IN ITS COURSE AS LONDON ITSELF WHERE IS SUCH ANOTHER
4667-92220-0029 IT HAS EVER BEEN A RIVER OF PAGEANTS A RIVER OF SIGHS A RIVER INTO WHOSE PLACID DEPTHS KINGS AND QUEENS PRINCES AND CARDINALS HAVE WHISPERED STATE SECRETS
4667-92220-0030 AS NO OTHER RIVER IN THE WORLD CAN BOAST SOMETIMES WE SALLY FORTH IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURES IN THE THICK OF A LONDON PARTICULAR MISTER GUPPY'S PHRASE FOR A FOG WHEN YOU ARE ONCE ENSCONCED IN YOUR GARDEN SEAT BY THE DRIVER
4667-92220-0031 YOU GO LUMBERING THROUGH A WORLD OF BOBBING SHADOWS WHERE ALL IS WEIRD VAGUE GREY DENSE AND WHERE GREAT OBJECTS LOOM UP SUDDENLY IN THE MIST AND THEN DISAPPEAR WHERE THE SKY HEAVY AND LEADEN SEEMS TO DESCEND BODILY UPON YOUR HEAD
4667-92220-0032 AND THE AIR IS FULL OF A KIND OF LUMINOUS YELLOW SMOKE A LIPTON'S TEA BUS IS THE ONLY ONE WE CAN SEE PLAINLY IN THIS SORT OF WEATHER AND SO WE ALWAYS TAKE IT
4667-92220-0033 BECAUSE I AM WELL AWARE THAT THEY ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY SPECIFIC FOR THE ORDINARY TOURIST WHO WISHES TO SEE LONDON SYSTEMATICALLY AND WITHOUT ANY LOSS OF TIME IF YOU CARE TO GO TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR REACH THAT PLACE BY ANY PARTICULAR TIME
4667-92220-0034 AND ENDS OF THE CHARIOTS AS WE DO YOU MUST STAND QUIETLY AT ONE OF THE REGULAR POINTS OF DEPARTURE AND TRY TO DECIPHER IN A NARROW HORIZONTAL SPACE ALONG THE SIDE CERTAIN LITTLE WORDS THAT SHOW THE ROUTE AND DESTINATION OF THE VEHICLE
4667-92220-0035 OLD LONDONERS ASSERT THAT THEY ARE NOT BLINDED OR CONFUSED BY PEARS SOAP IN LETTERS TWO FEET HIGH SCARLET ON A GOLD GROUND BUT CAN SEE BELOW IN FINE PRINT AND WITH THE NAKED EYE SUCH LEGENDS AS TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD WESTBOURNE GROVE SAINT PANCRAS
4667-92220-0036 IT IS CERTAINLY REASONABLE THAT THE OMNIBUSES SHOULD BE DECORATED TO SUIT THE INHABITANTS OF THE PLACE RATHER THAN FOREIGNERS AND IT IS PERHAPS BETTER TO CARRY A FEW HUNDRED STUPID SOULS TO THE WRONG STATION DAILY THAN TO ALLOW THEM TO CLEANSE THEIR HANDS WITH THE WRONG SOAP
4667-92220-0037 OR QUENCH THEIR THIRST WITH THE WRONG WHICH IS TO SAY THE UNADVERTISED BEVERAGE THE CONDUCTORS DO ALL IN THEIR POWER TO MITIGATE THE LOT OF UNHAPPY STRANGERS
4667-92220-0038 WE CLAIM FOR OUR METHOD OF TRAVELLING NOT THAT IT IS AUTHORITATIVE BUT THAT IT IS SIMPLE SUITABLE TO PERSONS WHOSE DESIRES ARE FLEXIBLE AND WHOSE PLANS ARE NOT FIXED IT HAS ITS DISADVANTAGES WHICH MAY INDEED BE SAID OF ALMOST ANYTHING
4667-92220-0039 FOR INSTANCE WE HAD GONE FOR TWO SUCCESSIVE MORNINGS ON A CADBURY'S COCOA BUS TO FRANCESCA'S DRESSMAKER IN KENSINGTON ON THE THIRD MORNING DECEIVED BY THE AMBITIOUS AND UNSCRUPULOUS CADBURY
4667-92220-0040 WE MOUNTED IT AND JOURNEYED ALONG COMFORTABLY THREE MILES TO THE EAST OF KENSINGTON BEFORE WE DISCOVERED OUR MISTAKE IT WAS A PLEASANT AND ATTRACTIVE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE WE FOUND OURSELVES BUT UNFORTUNATELY FRANCESCA'S DRESSMAKER DID NOT RESIDE THERE
4667-92220-0041 IF YOU HAVE DETERMINED TO TAKE A CERTAIN TRAIN FROM A CERTAIN STATION AND DO NOT CARE FOR ANY OTHER NO MATTER IF IT SHOULD TURN OUT TO BE JUST AS INTERESTING THEN NEVER TAKE A LIPTON'S TEA BUS
4667-92220-0042 AND IF I DID NOT FEEL THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN SAID BEFORE IT IS SO APT I SHOULD QUOTE HORACE AND SAY
4667-92220-0043 THERE IS NO BUS UNSEIZED BY THE NAPOLEONIC LIPTON DO NOT ASCEND ONE OF THEM SUPPOSING FOR A MOMENT THAT BY PAYING FOURPENCE AND GOING TO THE VERY END OF THE ROUTE YOU WILL COME TO A NEAT TEA STATION
4667-92220-0044 NEVER NOR WITH A DRAUGHT OF CADBURY'S COCOA OR NESTLE'S MILK
4667-92220-0045 AND THOUGH YOU MAY HAVE PASSED OTHER BUSES WITH THE SAME HIGHLY COLOURED NAMES GLARING AT YOU UNTIL THEY ARE BURNED INTO THE GREY MATTER OF YOUR BRAIN TO REMAIN THERE AS LONG AS THE COPY BOOK MAXIMS YOU PENNED WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD
4667-92220-0046 OF COURSE IT MUST BE SO OR THEY WOULD NEVER BE PROSECUTED BUT ALTHOUGH THEY MAY ALLURE MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS THEY WILL LOSE TWO IN OUR MODEST PERSONS WHEN SALEMINA AND I GO INTO A CAFE FOR TEA WE ASK THE YOUNG WOMAN IF THEY SERVE LIPTON'S
4667-92220-0047 AND IF THEY SAY YES WE TAKE COFFEE THIS IS SELF PUNISHMENT INDEED IN LONDON
4667-92220-0048 PERHAPS NOT COMMENSURATE WITH THE PHYSICAL EFFECT OF THE COFFEE UPON US BUT THESE DELICATE MATTERS CAN NEVER BE ADJUSTED WITH ABSOLUTE EXACTITUDE SOMETIMES WHEN WE ARE TO TRAVEL ON A PEARS SOAP BUS WE BUY BEFOREHAND A BIT OF PURE WHITE CASTILE
4667-92220-0049 CUT FROM A SHRINKING RESERVED EXCLUSIVE BAR WITH NO NAME UPON IT
