6276-62021-0000 BY J J HOOPER UNTIL SIMON ENTERED HIS SEVENTEENTH YEAR HE LIVED WITH HIS FATHER AN OLD HARD SHELL BAPTIST PREACHER WHO THOUGH VERY PIOUS AND REMARKABLY AUSTERE WAS VERY AVARICIOUS
6276-62021-0001 THE OLD MAN REARED HIS BOY OR ENDEAVORED TO DO SO ACCORDING TO THE STRICTEST REQUISITIONS OF THE MORAL LAW BUT HE LIVED AT THE TIME TO WHICH WE REFER IN MIDDLE GEORGIA WHICH WAS THEN NEWLY SETTLED
6276-62021-0002 AND SIMON WHOSE WITS WERE ALWAYS TOO SHARP FOR HIS FATHER'S CONTRIVED TO CONTRACT ALL THE COARSE VICES INCIDENT TO SUCH A REGION HE STOLE HIS MOTHER'S ROOSTERS TO FIGHT THEM AT BOB SMITH'S GROCERY
6276-62021-0003 AND HIS FATHER'S PLOW HORSES TO ENTER THEM IN QUARTER MATCHES AT THE SAME PLACE HE PITCHED DOLLARS WITH BOB SMITH HIMSELF AND COULD BEAT HIM INTO DOLL RAGS WHENEVER IT CAME TO A MEASUREMENT TO CROWN HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS
6276-62021-0004 SIMON WAS TIP TOP AT THE GAME OF OLD SLEDGE WHICH WAS THE FASHIONABLE GAME OF THAT ERA AND WAS EARLY INITIATED IN THE MYSTERIES OF STOCKING THE PAPERS
6276-62021-0005 THE VICIOUS HABITS OF SIMON WERE OF COURSE A SORE TROUBLE TO HIS FATHER ELDER JEDEDIAH HE REASONED HE COUNSELED HE REMONSTRATED AND HE LASHED BUT SIMON WAS AN INCORRIGIBLE IRRECLAIMABLE DEVIL
6276-62021-0006 ONE DAY THE SIMPLE MINDED OLD MAN RETURNED RATHER UNEXPECTEDLY TO THE FIELD WHERE HE HAD LEFT SIMON AND BEN AND A NEGRO BOY NAMED BILL AT WORK BEN WAS STILL FOLLOWING HIS PLOW BUT SIMON AND BILL WERE IN A FENCE CORNER
6276-62021-0007 VERY EARNESTLY ENGAGED AT SEVEN UP OF COURSE THE GAME WAS INSTANTLY SUSPENDED AS SOON AS THEY SPIED THE OLD MAN SIXTY OR SEVENTY YARDS OFF STRIDING TOWARDS THEM IT WAS EVIDENTLY A GONE CASE WITH SIMON AND BILL
6276-62021-0008 AND BESIDES WITH THE HAND I HELT WHEN WE QUIT I SHOULD A BEAT YOU AND WON IT ALL ANY WAY WELL BUT MASS SIMON WE NEBBER FINISH DE GAME AND DE RULE
6276-62021-0009 DON'T YOU SEE DADDY'S RIGHT DOWN UPON US WITH AN ARMFUL OF HICKORIES I TELL YOU I HELT NOTHIN BUT TRUMPS AND COULD A BEAT THE HORNS OFF A BILLY GOAT DON'T THAT SATISFY YOU
6276-62021-0010 ABOUT THIS TIME A THOUGHT STRUCK SIMON AND IN A LOW TONE FOR BY THIS TIME THE REVEREND JEDEDIAH WAS CLOSE AT HAND HE CONTINUED BUT MAY BE DADDY DON'T KNOW
6276-62021-0011 RIGHT DOWN SURE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOIN LET'S TRY HIM WITH A LIE
6276-62021-0012 LET'S TELL HIM WE'VE BEEN PLAYIN MUMBLE PEG
6276-62021-0013 ALL THIS WAS SETTLED AND A PIG DRIVEN INTO THE GROUND SLYLY AND HURRIEDLY BETWEEN SIMON'S LEGS AS HE SAT ON THE GROUND JUST AS THE OLD MAN REACHED THE SPOT
6276-62021-0014 SEVERAL NEATLY TRIMMED SPROUTS OF FORMIDABLE LENGTH WHILE IN HIS LEFT HAND HE HELD ONE WHICH HE WAS INTENTLY ENGAGED IN DIVESTING OF ITS SUPERFLUOUS TWIGS
6276-62021-0015 WHAT SAITH THE SCRIPTUR SIMON
6276-62021-0016 AND SO FORTH AND SO ON WHAT IN THE ROUND CREATION OF THE YEARTH HAVE YOU AND THAT NIGGER BEEN A DOIN BILL SHOOK WITH FEAR BUT SIMON WAS COOL AS A CUCUMBER
6276-62021-0017 AND ANSWERED HIS FATHER TO THE EFFECT THAT THEY HAD BEEN WASTING A LITTLE TIME IN THE GAME OF MUMBLE PEG MUMBLE PEG MUMBLE PEG REPEATED OLD MISTER SUGGS WHAT'S THAT
6276-62021-0018 SIMON EXPLAINED THE PROCESS OF ROOTING FOR THE PEG HOW THE OPERATOR GOT UPON HIS KNEES KEEPING HIS ARMS STIFF BY HIS SIDES LEANED FORWARD AND EXTRACTED THE PEG WITH HIS TEETH
6276-62021-0019 SO YOU GIT UPON YOUR KNEES DO YOU TO PULL UP THAT NASTY LITTLE STICK YOU'D BETTER GIT UPON EM TO ASK MERCY FOR YOUR SINFUL SOULS AND FOR A DYIN WORLD
6276-62021-0020 BUT LET'S SEE ONE O YOU GIT THE PEG UP NOW THE FIRST IMPULSE OF OUR HERO WAS TO VOLUNTEER TO GRATIFY THE CURIOSITY OF HIS WORTHY SIRE BUT A GLANCE AT THE OLD MAN'S COUNTENANCE CHANGED HIS NOTION
6276-62021-0021 AND HE REMARKED THAT BILL WAS A LONG WAYS THE BEST HAND BILL WHO DID NOT DEEM SIMON'S MODESTY AN OMEN VERY FAVORABLE TO HIMSELF WAS INCLINED TO RECIPROCATE COMPLIMENTS WITH HIS YOUNG MASTER
6276-62021-0022 BUT A GESTURE OF IMPATIENCE FROM THE OLD MAN SET HIM INSTANTLY UPON HIS KNEES AND BENDING FORWARD HE ESSAYED TO LAY HOLD WITH HIS TEETH OF THE PEG
6276-62021-0023 VERY WICKEDLY PUSHED A HALF INCH FURTHER DOWN JUST AS THE BREECHES AND HIDE OF THE BOY WERE STRETCHED TO THE UTTERMOST
6276-62021-0024 WITH BOTH HANDS UPON THE PRECISE SPOT WHERE THE TENSION WAS GREATEST WITH A LOUD YELL BILL PLUNGED FORWARD UPSETTING SIMON AND ROLLED IN THE GRASS RUBBING THE CASTIGATED PART WITH FEARFUL ENERGY
6276-62021-0025 SIMON THOUGH OVERTHROWN WAS UNHURT AND HE WAS MENTALLY COMPLIMENTING HIMSELF UPON THE SAGACITY WHICH HAD PREVENTED HIS ILLUSTRATING THE GAME OF MUMBLE PEG FOR THE PATERNAL AMUSEMENT
6276-62021-0026 WHEN HIS ATTENTION WAS ARRESTED BY THE OLD MAN'S STOOPING TO PICK UP SOMETHING WHAT IS IT A CARD UPON WHICH SIMON HAD BEEN SITTING
6276-62021-0027 AND WHICH THEREFORE HAD NOT GONE WITH THE REST OF THE PACK INTO HIS POCKET
6276-62021-0028 CARDS AND THOUGH HE DECIDEDLY INCLINED TO THE OPINION THAT THIS WAS ONE HE WAS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN OF THE FACT HAD SIMON KNOWN THIS HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE ESCAPED
6276-62021-0029 WHICH IS ALWAYS WORN BY THE INTERROGATOR WHO DOES NOT DESIRE OR EXPECT TO INCREASE HIS KNOWLEDGE BY HIS QUESTIONS ASKED WHAT'S THIS SIMON THE JACK A DIMUNTS PROMPTLY RESPONDED SIMON
6276-62021-0030 IN AN IRONICALLY AFFECTIONATE TONE OF VOICE
6276-62021-0031 NOTHIN AIN'T TRUMPS NOW SAID SIMON WHO MISAPPREHENDED HIS FATHER'S MEANING BUT CLUBS WAS
6276-62021-0032 THEY HAD THEN MOST UNQUESTIONABLY BEEN THROWING CARDS THE SCOUNDRELS
6276-62021-0033 TO THE MULBERRY WITH BOTH ON YE IN A HURRY SAID THE OLD MAN STERNLY BUT THE LADS WERE NOT DISPOSED TO BE IN A HURRY FOR THE MULBERRY WAS THE SCENE OF ALL FORMAL PUNISHMENT ADMINISTERED DURING WORK HOURS IN THE FIELD
6276-62021-0034 AND KICKING AT HIM SO AS ALMOST TO TOUCH HIS COAT TAIL WITH HIS SHOE IN THIS STYLE THEY WALKED ON TO THE MULBERRY TREE IN WHOSE SHADE SIMON'S BROTHER BEN WAS RESTING
6276-62021-0035 IT MUST NOT BE SUPPOSED THAT DURING THE WALK TO THE PLACE OF PUNISHMENT SIMON'S MIND WAS EITHER INACTIVE OR ENGAGED IN SUGGESTING THE GRIMACES AND CONTORTIONS WHEREWITH HE WAS PANTOMIMICALLY EXPRESSING HIS IRREVERENT SENTIMENTS TOWARD HIS FATHER
6276-62021-0036 FAR FROM IT THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS LIMBS AND FEATURES WERE THE MERE WORKINGS OF HABIT THE SELF GRINDING OF THE CORPOREAL MACHINE FOR WHICH HIS REASONING HALF WAS ONLY REMOTELY RESPONSIBLE
6276-62021-0037 FOR WHILE SIMON'S PERSON WAS THUS ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT MAKING GAME OF OLD JED'DIAH HIS WITS IN VIEW OF THE ANTICIPATED FLOGGING WERE DASHING
6276-62021-0038 SPRINGING BOUNDING DARTING ABOUT IN HOT CHASE OF SOME EXPEDIENT SUITABLE TO THE NECESSITIES OF THE CASE MUCH AFTER THE MANNER IN WHICH PUSS
6276-62021-0039 WHEN BETTY ARMED WITH THE BROOM AND HOTLY SEEKING VENGEANCE FOR PANTRY ROBBED OR BED DEFILED HAS CLOSED UPON HER THE GARRET DOORS AND WINDOWS ATTEMPTS ALL SORTS OF IMPOSSIBLE EXITS
6276-62021-0040 TO COME DOWN AT LAST IN THE CORNER WITH PANTING SIDE AND GLARING EYE EXHAUSTED AND DEFENSELESS OUR UNFORTUNATE HERO
6276-62021-0041 HE STOOD WITH A DOGGED LOOK AWAITING THE ISSUE THE OLD MAN SUGGS MADE NO REMARK TO ANY ONE WHILE HE WAS SIZING UP BILL A PROCESS WHICH THOUGH BY NO MEANS NOVEL TO SIMON
6276-62021-0042 SEEMED TO EXCITE IN HIM A SORT OF PAINFUL INTEREST HE WATCHED IT CLOSELY AS IF ENDEAVORING TO LEARN THE PRECISE FASHION OF HIS FATHER'S KNOT AND WHEN AT LAST BILL WAS SWUNG UP A TIPTOE TO A LIMB
6276-62021-0043 AND THE WHIPPING COMMENCED SIMON'S EYE FOLLOWED EVERY MOVEMENT OF HIS FATHER'S ARM AND AS EACH BLOW DESCENDED UPON THE BARE SHOULDERS OF HIS SABLE FRIEND
6276-62021-0044 I WISH SHE WAS HERE TO HOLD DADDY OFF
6276-62021-0045 HOW SHE WOULD CLING TO THE OLD FELLOW'S COAT TAIL

6276-62021-0056 SHOULD VENTURE TO EXPRESS AN OPINION CONCERNING THE MANNERS CUSTOMS OR ANYTHING ELSE APPERTAINING TO OR IN ANY WISE CONNECTED WITH
6276-62021-0057 THERE WERE TWO PROPOSITIONS WHICH WITNESSED THEIR OWN TRUTH TO THE MIND OF MISTER SUGGS THE ONE WAS THAT A MAN WHO HAD NEVER BEEN AT AUGUSTA COULD NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT CITY
6276-62021-0058 AU FAIT UPON ALL SUBJECTS WHATSOEVER IT WAS THEREFORE IN A TONE OF MINGLED INDIGNATION AND CONTEMPT THAT HE REPLIED TO THE LAST REMARK OF SIMON BOB SMITH
