2240-148522-0000 THE PERIOD WHEN THE CONSTRUCTION OF DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY UPON THE RUINS OF AN ARISTOCRACY HAS JUST BEEN COMPLETED IS ESPECIALLY THAT AT WHICH THIS SEPARATION OF MEN FROM ONE ANOTHER
2240-148522-0001 AND THE EGOTISM RESULTING FROM IT MOST FORCIBLY STRIKE THE OBSERVATION DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITIES NOT ONLY CONTAIN A LARGE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT CITIZENS BUT THEY ARE CONSTANTLY FILLED WITH MEN WHO
2240-148522-0002 AND AS THEY DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT THEY CAN HENCEFORWARD EVER HAVE OCCASION TO CLAIM THE ASSISTANCE OF THEIR FELLOW CREATURES THEY DO NOT SCRUPLE TO SHOW THAT THEY CARE FOR NOBODY BUT THEMSELVES
2240-148522-0003 AN ARISTOCRACY SELDOM YIELDS WITHOUT A PROTRACTED STRUGGLE IN THE COURSE OF WHICH IMPLACABLE ANIMOSITIES ARE KINDLED BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF SOCIETY
2240-148522-0004 AND OF FEAR IT IS THEN COMMONLY AT THE OUTSET OF DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY THAT CITIZENS ARE MOST DISPOSED TO LIVE APART DEMOCRACY LEADS MEN NOT TO DRAW NEAR TO THEIR FELLOW CREATURES
2240-148522-0005 BUT DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONS LEAD THEM TO SHUN EACH OTHER AND PERPETUATE IN A STATE OF EQUALITY THE ANIMOSITIES WHICH THE STATE OF INEQUALITY ENGENDERED THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OF THE AMERICANS
2240-148522-0006 IS THAT THEY HAVE ARRIVED AT A STATE OF DEMOCRACY WITHOUT HAVING TO ENDURE A DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION
2240-148522-0007 EASILY FORGIVES HIS SUBJECTS FOR NOT LOVING HIM PROVIDED THEY DO NOT LOVE EACH OTHER HE DOES NOT ASK THEM TO ASSIST HIM IN GOVERNING THE STATE
2240-148522-0008 THUS THE VICES WHICH DESPOTISM ENGENDERS ARE PRECISELY THOSE WHICH EQUALITY FOSTERS THESE TWO THINGS MUTUALLY AND PERNICIOUSLY COMPLETE AND ASSIST EACH OTHER
2240-148522-0009 EQUALITY PLACES MEN SIDE BY SIDE UNCONNECTED BY ANY COMMON TIE DESPOTISM RAISES BARRIERS TO KEEP THEM ASUNDER THE FORMER PREDISPOSES THEM NOT TO CONSIDER THEIR FELLOW CREATURES
2240-148522-0010 THE LATTER MAKES GENERAL INDIFFERENCE A SORT OF PUBLIC VIRTUE DESPOTISM THEN WHICH IS AT ALL TIMES DANGEROUS IS MORE PARTICULARLY TO BE FEARED IN DEMOCRATIC AGES
2240-148522-0011 WHEN THE MEMBERS OF A COMMUNITY ARE FORCED TO ATTEND TO PUBLIC AFFAIRS THEY ARE NECESSARILY DRAWN FROM THE CIRCLE OF THEIR OWN INTERESTS AND SNATCHED AT TIMES FROM SELF OBSERVATION
2240-148522-0012 AS SOON AS A MAN BEGINS TO TREAT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS IN PUBLIC
2240-148522-0013 AND THAT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THEIR SUPPORT HE MUST OFTEN LEND THEM HIS CO OPERATION WHEN THE PUBLIC IS SUPREME
2240-148522-0014 MANY OF THE PASSIONS WHICH CONGEAL AND KEEP ASUNDER HUMAN HEARTS ARE THEN OBLIGED TO RETIRE AND HIDE BELOW THE SURFACE PRIDE MUST BE DISSEMBLED DISDAIN
2240-148522-0015 THE MEN WHOSE ELEVATED MINDS OR ASPIRING HOPES ARE TOO CLOSELY CIRCUMSCRIBED IN PRIVATE LIFE CONSTANTLY FEEL THAT THEY CANNOT DO WITHOUT THE POPULATION WHICH SURROUNDS THEM
2240-148522-0016 I MAY HERE BE MET BY AN OBJECTION DERIVED FROM ELECTIONEERING INTRIGUES THE MEANNESSES OF CANDIDATES AND THE CALUMNIES OF THEIR OPPONENTS
2240-148522-0017 BUT THIS SAME DESIRE LEADS ALL MEN IN THE LONG RUN MUTUALLY TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER AND IF IT HAPPENS THAT AN ELECTION ACCIDENTALLY SEVERS TWO FRIENDS
2240-148522-0018 THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM BRINGS A MULTITUDE OF CITIZENS PERMANENTLY TOGETHER WHO WOULD ALWAYS HAVE REMAINED UNKNOWN TO EACH OTHER FREEDOM ENGENDERS PRIVATE ANIMOSITIES BUT DESPOTISM GIVES BIRTH
2240-148522-0019 AND SO FATAL THEY ALSO THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE WELL TO INFUSE POLITICAL LIFE INTO EACH PORTION OF THE TERRITORY IN ORDER TO MULTIPLY TO AN INFINITE EXTENT
2240-148522-0020 OPPORTUNITIES OF ACTING IN CONCERT FOR ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND TO MAKE THEM CONSTANTLY FEEL THEIR MUTUAL DEPENDENCE ON EACH OTHER THE PLAN WAS A WISE ONE
2240-148522-0021 THE GENERAL AFFAIRS OF A COUNTRY ONLY ENGAGE THE ATTENTION OF LEADING POLITICIANS WHO ASSEMBLE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE SAME PLACES AND AS THEY OFTEN LOSE SIGHT OF EACH OTHER AFTERWARDS
2240-148522-0022 IT IS DIFFICULT TO DRAW A MAN OUT OF HIS OWN CIRCLE TO INTEREST HIM IN THE DESTINY OF THE STATE
2240-148522-0023 BUT IF IT BE PROPOSED TO MAKE A ROAD CROSS THE END OF HIS ESTATE HE WILL SEE AT A GLANCE THAT THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS SMALL PUBLIC AFFAIR AND HIS GREATEST PRIVATE AFFAIRS AND HE WILL DISCOVER
2240-148522-0024 A BRILLIANT ACHIEVEMENT MAY WIN FOR YOU THE FAVOR OF A PEOPLE AT ONE STROKE BUT TO EARN THE LOVE AND RESPECT OF THE POPULATION WHICH SURROUNDS YOU
2240-148522-0025 IN SPITE OF THE PROPENSITIES WHICH SEVER THEM
2240-148522-0026 ON THE CONTRARY THEY CONSTANTLY KEEP ON EASY TERMS WITH THE LOWER CLASSES THEY LISTEN TO THEM THEY SPEAK TO THEM EVERY DAY THEY KNOW THAT THE RICH IN DEMOCRACIES ALWAYS STAND IN NEED OF THE POOR
2240-148522-0027 AND THAT IN DEMOCRATIC AGES YOU ATTACH A POOR MAN TO YOU MORE BY YOUR MANNER THAN BY BENEFITS CONFERRED THE MAGNITUDE OF SUCH BENEFITS WHICH SETS OFF THE DIFFERENCE OF CONDITIONS
2240-148522-0028 CAUSES A SECRET IRRITATION TO THOSE WHO REAP ADVANTAGE FROM THEM BUT THE CHARM OF SIMPLICITY OF MANNERS IS ALMOST IRRESISTIBLE THEIR AFFABILITY CARRIES MEN AWAY
2240-148522-0029 AND EVEN THEIR WANT OF POLISH IS NOT ALWAYS DISPLEASING THIS TRUTH DOES NOT TAKE ROOT AT ONCE IN THE MINDS OF THE RICH THEY GENERALLY RESIST IT AS LONG AS THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION LASTS
2240-148522-0030 AND THEY DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT REVOLUTION IS ACCOMPLISHED THEY ARE VERY READY TO DO GOOD TO THE PEOPLE BUT THEY STILL CHOOSE TO KEEP THEM AT ARM'S LENGTH
2240-148522-0031 BUT THEY ARE MISTAKEN THEY MIGHT SPEND FORTUNES THUS WITHOUT WARMING THE HEARTS OF THE POPULATION AROUND THEM THAT POPULATION DOES NOT ASK THEM FOR THE SACRIFICE OF THEIR MONEY BUT OF THEIR PRIDE
2240-148522-0032 THE BEST INFORMED INHABITANTS OF EACH DISTRICT CONSTANTLY USE THEIR INFORMATION TO DISCOVER NEW TRUTHS WHICH MAY AUGMENT THE GENERAL PROSPERITY AND IF THEY HAVE MADE ANY SUCH DISCOVERIES
2240-148522-0033 AND I HAVE REMARKED A HUNDRED INSTANCES IN WHICH THEY HARDLY EVER FAILED TO LEND FAITHFUL SUPPORT TO EACH OTHER THE FREE INSTITUTIONS WHICH THE INHABITANTS OF THE UNITED STATES POSSESS
2240-148522-0034 AND THE POLITICAL RIGHTS OF WHICH THEY MAKE SO MUCH USE REMIND EVERY CITIZEN AND IN A THOUSAND WAYS THAT HE LIVES IN SOCIETY
2240-148522-0035 BUT I CONTEND THAT IN ORDER TO COMBAT THE EVILS WHICH EQUALITY MAY PRODUCE THERE IS ONLY ONE EFFECTUAL REMEDY NAMELY
