5893-54391-0001 A JOYFUL LIGHT OF RECOGNITION IN HIS EYES THEN SUDDENLY HE STOOPED AND PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE FLOOR WHEN HE CAME UPRIGHT HIS FACE WAS VERY RED HE DID NOT LOOK AT THE TALL GRAY HAIRED MAN AGAIN AS HE ADVANCED INTO THE ROOM MELLICENT TURNED TO HIM EAGERLY

5893-54391-0006 OH I SEE SO HE ISN'T NEAR ENOUGH TO COME IN ON THE MONEY THIS TIME IT WAS THE LAWYER WHO WAS SMILING STRAIGHT INTO MISTER SMITH'S EYES BUT HE DID NOT SMILE FOR LONG A SUDDEN QUESTION FROM MELLICENT SEEMED TO FREEZE THE SMILE ON HIS LIPS

5893-54391-0008 THE LAWYER CAME TO A STILL MORE UNHAPPY PAUSE OF COURSE WE'VE SEEN HIS PICTURES BROKE IN MELLICENT BUT THOSE DON'T TELL US ANYTHING AND YOU KNEW HIM SO WON'T YOU TELL US WHAT HE WAS LIKE PLEASE WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR FATHER TO COME UP WAS HE NICE AND JOLLY OR WAS HE STIFF AND HAUGHTY WHAT WAS HE LIKE
5893-54391-0009 YES WHAT WAS HE LIKE COAXED MISTER SMITH AGAIN MISTER SMITH FOR SOME REASON SEEMED TO BE HIGHLY AMUSED THE LAWYER LIFTED HIS HEAD SUDDENLY AN ODD FLASH CAME TO HIS EYES LIKE OH JUST AN ORDINARY MAN YOU KNOW SOMEWHAT CONCEITED OF COURSE
5893-54391-0010 A QUEER LITTLE HALF GASP CAME FROM MISTER SMITH BUT THE LAWYER WAS NOT LOOKING AT MISTER SMITH ECCENTRIC YOU'VE HEARD THAT PROBABLY AND HE HAS DONE CRAZY THINGS AND NO MISTAKE OF COURSE WITH HIS MONEY AND POSITION
5893-54391-0011 MISTER SMITH GAVE A REAL GASP THIS TIME AND MISSUS JANE BLAISDELL EJACULATED THERE I TOLD YOU SO I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG AND NOW HE'LL COME BACK AND CLAIM THE MONEY YOU SEE IF HE DON'T AND IF WE'VE GONE AND SPENT ANY OF IT
5893-54391-0012 GIVE YOURSELF NO UNEASINESS ON THAT SCORE MADAM THE LAWYER ASSURED HER GRAVELY I THINK I CAN SAFELY GUARANTEE HE WILL NOT DO THAT THEN YOU THINK HE'S DEAD
5893-54391-0013 DEAD OR ALIVE HE HAS NO FURTHER POWER OVER THAT MONEY NOW
5893-54391-0014 IT IS YOURS BOWED THE LAWYER BUT MISTER SMITH SAYS WE'VE PROBABLY GOT TO PAY A TAX ON IT THRUST IN MISSUS JANE IN A WORRIED VOICE
5893-54391-0015 AND ISN'T THERE ANY WAY WE CAN SAVE DOING THAT BEFORE MISTER NORTON COULD ANSWER A HEAVY STEP DOWN THE HALL HERALDED MISTER FRANK BLAISDELL'S ADVANCE AND IN THE ENSUING CONFUSION OF HIS ARRIVAL MISTER SMITH SLIPPED AWAY
5893-54391-0016 BUT AFTERWARDS SHE CONCLUDED SHE MUST HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN FOR THE TWO MEN APPEARED TO BECOME AT ONCE THE BEST OF FRIENDS MISTER NORTON REMAINED IN TOWN SEVERAL DAYS AND FREQUENTLY SHE SAW HIM AND MISTER SMITH CHATTING PLEASANTLY TOGETHER OR STARTING OFF APPARENTLY FOR A WALK
5893-54391-0017 MELLICENT WAS VERY SURE THEREFORE THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN IN THINKING SHE HAD HEARD MISTER SMITH UTTER SO REMARKABLE AN EXCLAMATION AS HE LEFT THE ROOM THAT FIRST DAY
5893-54391-0018 DURING THE STAY OF MISTER NORTON IN HILLERTON AND FOR SOME DAYS AFTERWARD THE BLAISDELLS WERE TOO ABSORBED IN THE MERE DETAILS OF ACQUIRING AND TEMPORARILY INVESTING THEIR WEALTH TO PAY ATTENTION TO ANYTHING ELSE
5893-54391-0019 FINDING A PLACE TO PUT IT AS MISS FLORA BREATHLESSLY TERMED IT MISSUS HATTIE SAID THAT FOR HER PART SHE SHOULD LIKE TO LEAVE THEIR SHARE ALL IN THE BANK
5893-54391-0020 THEN SHE'D HAVE IT TO SPEND WHENEVER SHE WANTED IT SHE YIELDED TO THE SHOCKED PROTESTATIONS OF THE OTHERS HOWEVER AND FINALLY CONSENTED THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD INVEST A LARGE PART OF IT IN THE BONDS HE SO WANTED LEAVING A GENEROUS SUM IN THE BANK IN HER OWN NAME
5893-54391-0021 SHE WAS ASSURED THAT THE BONDS WERE JUST AS GOOD AS MONEY ANYWAY AS THEY WERE THE KIND THAT WERE READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH MISSUS JANE WHEN SHE UNDERSTOOD THE MATTER WAS FOR INVESTING EVERY CENT OF THEIRS WHERE IT WOULD DRAW THE LARGEST INTEREST POSSIBLE
5893-54391-0022 MISSUS JANE HAD NEVER BEFORE KNOWN VERY MUCH ABOUT INTEREST AND SHE WAS FASCINATED WITH ITS DELIGHTFUL POSSIBILITIES SHE SPENT WHOLE DAYS JOYFULLY FIGURING PERCENTAGES AND WAS AWAKENED FROM HER HAPPY ABSORPTION
5893-54391-0023 ONLY BY THE UNPLEASANT REALIZATION THAT HER HUSBAND WAS NOT IN SYMPATHY WITH HER IDEAS AT ALL HE SAID THAT THE MONEY WAS HIS NOT HERS AND THAT FOR ONCE IN HIS LIFE HE WAS GOING TO HAVE HIS WAY
5893-54391-0024 HIS WAY IN THIS CASE PROVED TO BE THE PROMPT BUYING OUT OF THE COMPETING GROCERY ON THE OTHER CORNER AND THE ESTABLISHING OF GOOD SIZED BANK ACCOUNT THE REST OF THE MONEY HE SAID JANE MIGHT INVEST FOR A HUNDRED PER CENT IF SHE WANTED TO
5893-54391-0025 JANE WAS PLEASED TO THIS EXTENT AND ASKED IF IT WERE POSSIBLE THAT SHE COULD GET SUCH A SPLENDID RATE AS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT SHE HAD NOT FIGURED ON THAT SHE WAS NOT SO PLEASED LATER WHEN MISTER NORTON AND THE BANKERS TOLD HER WHAT SHE COULD GET WITH SAFETY
5893-54391-0026 AND SHE WAS VERY ANGRY BECAUSE THEY FINALLY APPEALED TO HER HUSBAND AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO CONTENT HERSELF WITH A PALTRY FIVE OR SIX PER CENT
5893-54391-0027 SHE TOLD FLORA THAT SHE OUGHT TO THANK HER STARS THAT SHE HAD THE MONEY HERSELF IN HER OWN NAME TO DO JUST AS SHE PLEASED WITH WITHOUT ANY OLD FOGY MEN BOSSING HER BUT FLORA ONLY SHIVERED AND SAID MERCY ME AND THAT FOR HER PART SHE WISHED SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY WHAT TO DO WITH IT
5893-54391-0028 AND SHE SUPPOSED SHE WOULD BUY THINGS WITH IT AFTER A WHILE WHEN SHE GOT USED TO IT AND WAS NOT AFRAID TO SPEND IT MISS FLORA WAS INDEED QUITE BREATHLESS MOST OF THE TIME THESE DAYS
5893-54391-0029 AND SHE SHOWED HERSELF EAGER ALWAYS TO TAKE THEIR ADVICE BUT SHE WISHED THEY WOULD NOT ASK HER OPINION SHE WAS ALWAYS AFRAID TO GIVE IT AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE ONE ANYWAY ONLY SHE DID WORRY OF COURSE
5893-54391-0030 IT WAS SO COMFORTING ALWAYS TO SEE THEM SMILE AND HEAR THEM SAY PERFECTLY MY DEAR MISS FLORA PERFECTLY GIVE YOURSELF NO UNEASINESS TO BE SURE ONE DAY THE BIG FAT MAN NOT MISTER CHALMERS DID SNAP OUT
5893-54391-0031 NO MADAM ONLY THE LORD ALMIGHTY CAN GUARANTEE A GOVERNMENT BOND THE WHOLE COUNTRY MAY BE BLOWN TO ATOMS BY A VOLCANO TO MORROW MORNING SHE WAS STARTLED TERRIBLY STARTLED
5893-54391-0032 BUT SHE SAW AT ONCE OF COURSE THAT IT MUST BE JUST HIS WAY OF JOKING FOR OF COURSE THERE WASN'T ANY VOLCANO BIG ENOUGH TO BLOW UP THE WHOLE UNITED STATES
5893-54391-0033 SHE NEVER LIKED THAT FAT MAN AGAIN AFTER THAT SHE ALWAYS TALKED TO MISTER CHALMERS OR TO THE OTHER MAN WITH A WART ON HIS NOSE MISS FLORA HAD NEVER HAD A CHECK BOOK BEFORE BUT SHE TRIED VERY HARD TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT AND TO SHOW HERSELF NOT TOO STUPID
5893-54391-0034 SHE WAS GLAD THERE WERE SUCH A LOT OF CHECKS IN THE BOOK BUT SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE SHE'D EVER SPEND THEM ALL SUCH A LOT OF MONEY SHE HAD HAD A SAVINGS BANK BOOK TO BE SURE BUT SHE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PUT ANYTHING IN THE BANK FOR A LONG TIME AND SHE HAD BEEN WORRYING A GOOD DEAL LATELY FOR FEAR SHE WOULD HAVE TO DRAW SOME OUT BUSINESS HAD BEEN SO DULL
5893-54391-0035 THEY TOLD HER THAT SHE COULD HAVE ALL THE MONEY SHE WANTED BY JUST FILLING OUT ONE OF THE LITTLE SLIPS IN HER CHECK BOOK THE WAY THEY HAD TOLD HER TO DO IT AND TAKING IT TO MISTER CHALMERS'S BANK THAT THERE WERE A GOOD MANY THOUSAND DOLLARS THERE WAITING FOR HER TO SPEND JUST AS SHE LIKED
5893-54391-0036 AND THAT WHEN THEY WERE GONE MISTER CHALMERS WOULD TELL HER HOW TO SELL SOME OF HER BONDS AND GET MORE IT SEEMED VERY WONDERFUL THERE WERE OTHER THINGS TOO THAT THEY HAD TOLD HER TOO MANY FOR HER TO REMEMBER SOMETHING ABOUT INTEREST AND THINGS CALLED COUPONS THAT MUST BE CUT OFF THE BONDS AT CERTAIN TIMES
5893-54391-0037 SHE TRIED TO REMEMBER IT ALL BUT MISTER CHALMERS HAD BEEN VERY KIND AND HAD TOLD HER NOT TO FRET HE WOULD HELP HER WHEN THE TIME CAME MEANWHILE HE HAD RENTED HER A NICE TIN BOX THAT PULLED OUT LIKE A DRAWER IN THE SAFETY DEPOSIT VAULT UNDER THE BANK
5893-54391-0038 WHERE SHE COULD KEEP HER BONDS AND ALL THE OTHER PAPERS SUCH A LOT OF THEM THAT MISTER CHALMERS TOLD HER SHE MUST KEEP VERY CAREFULLY BUT IT WAS ALL SO NEW AND COMPLICATED AND EVERYBODY WAS ALWAYS TALKING AT ONCE SO NO WONDER INDEED THAT MISS FLORA WAS QUITE BREATHLESS WITH IT ALL
5893-54391-0039 THEY BECAME SUDDENLY AWARE OF THE ATTENTION HILLERTON WAS PAYING TO THEM THE WHOLE TOWN WAS AGOG THE GROCERY STORE THE RESIDENCE OF FRANK BLAISDELL AND MISS FLORA'S HUMBLE COTTAGE MIGHT BE FOUND AT NEARLY ANY DAYLIGHT HOUR WITH FROM ONE TO A DOZEN CURIOUS EYED GAZERS ON THE SIDEWALK BEFORE THEM
5893-54391-0040 THE TOWN PAPER HAD CONTAINED AN ELABORATE ACCOUNT OF THE BEQUEST AND THE REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING IT AND HILLERTON BECAME THE MECCA OF WANDERING AUTOMOBILES FOR MILES AROUND BIG METROPOLITAN DAILIES GOT WIND OF THE AFFAIR RECOGNIZED THE MAGIC NAME OF STANLEY G FULTON
5893-54391-0041 AND SENT REPORTERS POST HASTE TO HILLERTON SPECULATION AS TO WHETHER THE MULTI MILLIONAIRE WAS REALLY DEAD WAS PREVALENT EVERYWHERE AND A SEARCH FOR SOME CLUE TO HIS REPORTED SOUTH AMERICAN EXPLORING EXPEDITION WAS UNDERTAKEN IN SEVERAL QUARTERS
5893-54391-0042 VARIOUS RUMORS CONCERNING THE EXPEDITION APPEARED IMMEDIATELY BUT NONE OF THEM SEEMED TO HAVE ANY REALLY SOLID FOUNDATION INTERVIEWS WITH THE GREAT LAW FIRM HAVING THE HANDLING OF MISTER FULTON'S AFFAIRS WERE PRINTED BUT EVEN HERE LITTLE COULD BE LEARNED SAVE THE MERE FACT OF THE LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS
5893-54391-0043 UPON WHICH THEY HAD ACTED ACCORDING TO DIRECTIONS AND THE OTHER FACT THAT THERE STILL REMAINED ONE MORE PACKET UNDERSTOOD TO BE THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT TO BE OPENED IN TWO YEARS TIME IF MISTER FULTON REMAINED UNHEARD FROM
5893-54391-0044 THE LAWYERS WERE BLAND AND COURTEOUS BUT THEY REALLY HAD NOTHING TO SAY THEY DECLARED BEYOND THE ALREADY PUBLISHED FACTS IN HILLERTON THE BLAISDELLS ACCEPTED THIS NOTORIETY WITH CHARACTERISTIC VARIATION
5893-54391-0045 MISS FLORA AFTER CORDIALLY WELCOMING ONE NICE YOUNG MAN AND TELLING HIM ALL ABOUT HOW STRANGE AND WONDERFUL IT WAS AND HOW FRIGHTENED SHE FELT WAS SO SHOCKED AND DISTRESSED TO FIND ALL THAT SHE SAID AND A GREAT DEAL THAT SHE DID NOT SAY
5893-54391-0046 STARING AT HER FROM THE FIRST PAGE OF A BIG NEWSPAPER THAT SHE FORTHWITH BARRED HER DOORS AND REFUSED TO OPEN THEM TILL SHE SATISFIED HERSELF BY SURREPTITIOUS PEEPS THROUGH THE BLINDS THAT IT WAS ONLY A NEIGHBOR WHO WAS KNOCKING FOR ADMITTANCE
5893-54391-0047 AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE FROM A WESTERN RANCHMAN AND ANOTHER FROM A VERMONT FARMER BOTH ENTIRE STRANGERS DID NOT TEND TO LESSEN HER PERTURBATION OF MIND FRANK AT THE GROCERY STORE RATHER WELCOMED QUESTIONERS SO LONG AS THERE WAS A HOPE OF TURNING THEM INTO CUSTOMERS
5893-54391-0048 BUT HIS WIFE AND MELLICENT SHOWED ALMOST AS MUCH TERROR OF THEM AS DID MISS FLORA HERSELF JAMES BLAISDELL AND FRED STOICALLY ENDURED SUCH AS REFUSED TO BE SILENCED BY THEIR BRUSQUE NON COMMITTALISM
5893-54391-0049 OF THEM ALL PERHAPS MISSUS HATTIE WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT FOUND IN IT ANY REAL JOY AND COMFORT EVEN BESSIE EXCITED AND INTERESTED AS SHE WAS FAILED TO RESPOND WITH QUITE THE ENTHUSIASM THAT HER MOTHER SHOWED
5893-54391-0050 MISSUS HATTIE SAW EVERY REPORTER TALKED FREELY OF DEAR COUSIN STANLEY AND HIS WONDERFUL GENEROSITY AND EXPLAINED THAT SHE WOULD GO INTO MOURNING OF COURSE IF SHE KNEW HE WAS REALLY DEAD
5893-54391-0051 SHE SAT FOR TWO NEW PORTRAITS FOR NEWSPAPER USE BESIDES GRACIOUSLY POSING FOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHERS WHENEVER REQUESTED TO DO SO
5893-54391-0052 MISTER SMITH THESE DAYS WAS KEEPING RATHER CLOSELY TO HIS WORK ESPECIALLY WHEN REPORTERS WERE IN EVIDENCE HE HAD BEEN HEARD TO REMARK INDEED THAT HE HAD NO USE FOR REPORTERS
5893-54391-0053 CERTAINLY HE FOUGHT SHY OF THOSE INVESTIGATING THE FULTON BLAISDELL LEGACY HE READ THE NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS THOUGH MOST ATTENTIVELY PARTICULARLY THE ONES FROM CHICAGO THAT MISTER NORTON KINDLY SENT HIM SOMETIMES IT WAS IN ONE OF THESE PAPERS THAT HE FOUND THIS PARAGRAPH
5893-54391-0054 THE BEQUESTS HAVE BEEN PAID THE BLAISDELLS ARE REVELING IN THEIR NEW WEALTH AND MISTER FULTON IS STILL UNHEARD FROM THERE IS NOTHING NOW TO DO BUT TO AWAIT THE OPENING OF THE SECOND MYSTERIOUS PACKET TWO YEARS HENCE THIS IT IS UNDERSTOOD IS THE FINAL DISPOSITION OF HIS ESTATE
5893-54391-0055 AND IF HE IS REALLY DEAD SUCH WILL DOUBTLESS PROVE TO BE THE CASE THERE ARE THOSE HOWEVER WHO REMEMBERING THE MULTI MILLIONAIRE'S WELL KNOWN ECCENTRICITIES ARE SUSPECTING HIM OF LIVING IN QUIET RETIREMENT SOMEWHERE LAUGHING IN HIS SLEEVE AT THE TEMPEST IN THE TEAPOT THAT HE HAS CREATED
5893-54391-0056 AND THAT LONG BEFORE THE TWO YEARS ARE UP HE WILL BE BACK ON CHICAGO'S STREETS DEBONAIR AND SMILING AS EVER THE FACT THAT SO LITTLE CAN BE FOUND IN REGARD TO THE SOUTH AMERICAN EXPLORING EXPEDITION MIGHT GIVE COLOR TO THIS SUSPICION
5893-54391-0057 MISTER SMITH DID NOT SHOW THIS PARAGRAPH TO THE BLAISDELLS HE DESTROYED THE PAPER CONTAINING IT INDEED PROMPTLY AND EFFECTUALLY WITH A FURTIVE GLANCE OVER HIS SHOULDER AS HE DID SO IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME TOO THAT MISTER SMITH BEGAN TO COMPLAIN OF HIS EYES AND TO WEAR SMOKED GLASSES
5893-54391-0058 HE SAID HE FOUND THE NEW SNOW GLARING BUT YOU LOOK SO FUNNY MISTER SMITH SAID BENNY THE FIRST TIME HE SAW HIM WHY I DIDN'T HARDLY KNOW YOU DIDN'T YOU BENNY ASKED MISTER SMITH WITH SUDDENLY A BEAMING COUNTENANCE OH WELL THAT DOESN'T MATTER DOES IT
