9023-296467-0000 CONTAINING A THEORY OF THE EARTH A GENERAL HISTORY OF MAN OF THE BRUTE CREATION AND OF VEGETABLES MINERALS ET CETERA OF WHICH MISTER BARR PUBLISHED AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION IN TEN GOODLY VOLUMES THUS IN THIS WORK OF WORLD WIDE CELEBRITY IS THE FELINE RACE DISCUSSED
9023-296467-0001 I GIVE THE AUTHOR'S WORDS AS I FIND THEM THE CAT IS A FAITHLESS DOMESTIC AND ONLY KEPT THROUGH NECESSITY TO OPPOSE TO ANOTHER DOMESTIC WHICH INCOMMODES US STILL MORE AND WHICH WE CANNOT DRIVE AWAY
9023-296467-0002 FOR WE PAY NO RESPECT TO THOSE WHO BEING FOND OF ALL BEASTS KEEP CATS FOR AMUSEMENT THOUGH THESE ANIMALS ARE GENTLE AND FROLICKSOME WHEN YOUNG YET THEY EVEN THEN POSSESS AN INNATE CUNNING AND PERVERSE DISPOSITION WHICH AGE INCREASES AND WHICH EDUCATION ONLY SERVES TO CONCEAL
9023-296467-0003 LIKE ALL KNAVES THEY KNOW HOW TO CONCEAL THEIR INTENTIONS TO WATCH WAIT AND CHOOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SEIZING THEIR PREY TO FLY FROM PUNISHMENT AND TO REMAIN AWAY UNTIL THE DANGER IS OVER AND THEY CAN RETURN WITH SAFETY THEY READILY CONFORM TO THE HABITS OF SOCIETY BUT NEVER ACQUIRE ITS MANNERS
9023-296467-0004 FOR OF ATTACHMENT THEY HAVE ONLY THE APPEARANCE AS MAY BE SEEN BY THE OBLIQUITY OF THEIR MOTIONS AND DUPLICITY OF THEIR LOOKS THEY NEVER LOOK IN THE FACE THOSE WHO TREAT THEM BEST AND OF WHOM THEY SEEM TO BE THE MOST FOND
9023-296467-0005 BUT EITHER THROUGH FEAR OR FALSEHOOD THEY APPROACH HIM BY WINDINGS TO SEEK FOR THOSE CARESSES THEY HAVE NO PLEASURE IN BUT ONLY TO FLATTER THOSE FROM WHOM THEY RECEIVE THEM VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT FAITHFUL ANIMAL THE DOG WHOSE SENTIMENTS ARE ALL DIRECTED TO THE PERSON OF HIS MASTER
9023-296467-0006 THE CAT APPEARS ONLY TO FEEL FOR HIMSELF ONLY TO LOVE CONDITIONALLY ONLY TO PARTAKE OF SOCIETY THAT HE MAY ABUSE IT AND BY THIS DISPOSITION HE HAS MORE AFFINITY TO MAN THAN THE DOG WHO IS ALL SINCERITY
9023-296467-0007 THOUGH HE IS SADLY MISTAKEN ON THE SUBJECT OF WHICH HE WRITES THESE WERE PROBABLY HIS HONEST OPINIONS BUT WHAT CAN BE SAID FOR A WRITER IN THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA WHO HOLDS FORTH AS FOLLOWS AND IS NOT ONLY IGNORANT OF WHAT HE TALKS ABOUT BUT STEALS BUFFON'S ABSURD PREJUDICES AND PASSES THEM OFF AS HIS OWN
9023-296467-0008 IN HIS OPINION THE CAT IS A USEFUL BUT DECEITFUL DOMESTIC ALTHOUGH WHEN YOUNG IT IS PLAYFUL AND GAY IT POSSESSES AT THE SAME TIME AN INNATE MALICE AND PERVERSE DISPOSITION WHICH INCREASES AS IT GROWS UP AND WHICH EDUCATION LEARNS IT TO CONCEAL BUT NEVER TO SUBDUE
9023-296467-0009 HERE I THINK ARE SOME PRETTY SENTIMENTS AND SOME VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CAT KIND LET US HOPE THAT THE OTHER CONTRIBUTORS TO THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA KNEW SOMETHING MORE OF WHAT THEY WROTE ABOUT THAN THE GENTLEMAN ABOVE QUOTED AND THESE OPINIONS ARE NOT UNCOMMON
9023-296467-0010 FOR INSTANCE ALLOW ME TO QUOTE FROM AN ARTICLE IN A POPULAR MISCELLANY NO I CANNOT ABIDE CATS SAYS THE WRITER PET CATS WILD CATS TOM CATS GIB CATS PERSIAN CATS ANGORA CATS TORTOISESHELL CATS TABBY CATS BLACK CATS MANX CATS BRINDLED CATS
9023-296467-0011 NONE OF THESE CATS DELIGHT ME THEY ARE ASSOCIATED IN MY MIND WITH NONE BUT DISAGREEABLE OBJECTS AND REMEMBRANCES OLD MAIDS WITCHCRAFT DREADFUL SABBATHS WITH OLD WOMEN FLYING UP THE CHIMNEY UPON BROOM STICKS TO DRINK HELL BROTH WITH THE EVIL ONE
9023-296467-0012 CHARMS INCANTATIONS SORCERIES SUCKING CHILDREN'S BREATHS STOPPING OUT LATE ON THE TILES CATTERWAULING AND MOLROWING IN THE NIGHT SEASON PROWLING ABOUT THE STREETS AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS AND A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS TOO NUMEROUS AND TOO UNPLEASANT TO MENTION
9023-296467-0013 UPON THE OTHER HAND PUSS HAS HAD HER DEFENDERS AND MISS ISABEL HILL WRITES THUS POOR PINKEY I CAN SCARCE DARE A WORD IN PRAISE OF ONE BELONGING TO THY SLANDERED SISTERHOOD
9023-296467-0014 YET A FEW GOOD EXAMPLES EMBOLDEN ME TO ASSERT THAT I HAVE RARELY KNOWN ANY HARM OF CATS WHO WERE GIVEN A FAIR CHANCE THOUGH I OWN I HAVE SELDOM MET WITH ANY THAT HAVE ENJOYED THAT ADVANTAGE IS IT THEIR FAULT THAT THEY ARE BORN NEARLY WITHOUT BRAINS THOUGH WITH ALL THEIR SENSES ABOUT THEM AND OF A TENDER TURN
9023-296467-0015 OH THAT ALL FEMALES MADE SUCH GOOD USE OF THEIR TONGUES CROSS FROM SHEER MELANCHOLY REFLECTING IN THEIR STARVED AND PERSECUTED MATURITY ON THE FONDNESS LAVISHED OVER THE DAYS IN WHICH THEY WERE PET USELESS TOYS AS SOON AS THEY CAN DESERVE AND MAY REQUIRE KIND TREATMENT
9023-296467-0016 THEY ARE AS ILL USED AS IF THEY WERE CONSTANT WIVES RATHER UNFAIR ON LADIES OF THEIR EXCESSIVE GENIUS COULD EVERY CAT LIKE WHITTINGTON'S CATCH FORTUNES FOR HER MASTER AS WELL AS MICE WE SHOULD HEAR NO MORE SAID AGAINST THE SPECIES
9023-296467-0017 SUPPOSE THEY ONLY FAWN ON US BECAUSE WE HOUSE AND FEED THEM THEY HAVE NO NOBLER PROOFS OF FRIENDSHIP WITH WHICH TO THANK US AND IF THEIR VERY GRATITUDE FOR THIS SELF INTERESTED HIRE BE ADDUCED AS A CRIME ALAS POOR PUSSIES HAD MINETTE BEEN A THOMAS A WHISKERED FUR COLLARED PHILANDER
9023-296467-0018 HE WOULD MOST PROBABLY HAVE SURMOUNTED THAT UNMANLY WEAKNESS AND RECEIVED ALL FAVOURS AS BUT HIS DUE I NEVER SEE A MISSUS MOUSER RUBBING HER SOFT COAT AGAINST ME WITH ROUND UPTURNED EYES BUT I TRANSLATE HER PURR INTO WORDS LIKE THESE
9023-296467-0019 AGUR IN THE BOOK OF PROVERBS REFERS TO SOME AND ALL THROUGH SCRIPTURE WE FIND ANIMALS USED AS TYPES OF HUMAN CHARACTER CATS MAY TEACH US PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE AND EARNEST CONCENTRATION OF MIND ON A DESIRED OBJECT
9023-296467-0020 AS THEY WATCH FOR HOURS TOGETHER BY A MOUSE HOLE OR IN AMBUSH FOR A BIRD IN THEIR NICELY CALCULATED SPRINGS WE ARE TAUGHT NEITHER TO COME SHORT THROUGH WANT OF MERCY OR GO BEYOND THE MARK IN ITS EXCESS
9023-296467-0021 IN THEIR DELICATE WALKING AMIDST THE FRAGILE ARTICLES ON A TABLE OR MANTEL PIECE IS ILLUSTRATED THE TACT AND DISCRIMINATION BY WHICH WE SHOULD THREAD RATHER THAN FORCE OUR WAY AND IN PURSUIT OF OUR OWN ENDS AVOID THE INJURING OF OTHERS
9023-296467-0022 IN THEIR NOISELESS TREAD AND STEALTHY MOVEMENTS WE ARE REMINDED OF THE FREQUENT IMPORTANCE OF SECRESY AND CAUTION PRIOR TO ACTION WHILE THEIR PROMPTITUDE AT THE RIGHT MOMENT WARNS US ON THE OTHER HAND AGAINST THE EVILS OF IRRESOLUTION AND DELAY
9023-296467-0023 THE CURIOSITY WITH WHICH THEY SPY INTO ALL PLACES AND THE THOROUGH SMELLING WHICH ANY NEW OBJECT INVARIABLY RECEIVES FROM THEM COMMENDS TO US THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE EVEN UNDER DIFFICULTIES CATS HOWEVER WILL NEVER SMELL THE SAME THING TWICE OVER
9023-296467-0024 THEREBY SHOWING A RETENTIVE AS WELL AS AN ACQUIRING FACULTY THEN TO SPEAK OF WHAT MAY BE LEARNED FROM THEIR MERE FORM AND ORDINARY MOTIONS SO FULL OF BEAUTY AND GRACEFULNESS WHAT CAT WAS EVER AWKWARD OR CLUMSY
9023-296467-0025 WHETHER IN PLAY OR IN EARNEST CATS ARE THE VERY EMBODIMENT OF ELEGANCE AS YOUR CAT RUBS HER HEAD AGAINST SOMETHING YOU OFFER HER WHICH SHE EITHER DOES NOT FANCY OR DOES NOT WANT SHE INSTRUCTS YOU THAT THERE IS A GRACIOUS MODE OF REFUSING A THING
9023-296467-0026 AND AS SHE SITS UP LIKE A BEAR ON HER HIND LEGS TO ASK FOR SOMETHING WHICH CATS WILL OFTEN DO FOR A LONG TIME TOGETHER YOU MAY SEE THE ADVANTAGE OF A WINNING AND ENGAGING WAY AS WELL WHEN YOU ARE SEEKING A FAVOUR AS WHEN YOU THINK FIT TO DECLINE ONE
9023-296467-0027 IF TRUE COURTESY AND CONSIDERATENESS SHOULD PREVENT YOU NOT MERELY FROM POSITIVELY HURTING ANOTHER BUT ALSO FROM PURPOSELY CLASHING SAY WITH ANOTHER'S FANCIES PECULIARITIES OR PREDILECTIONS THIS TOO MAY BE LEARNED FROM THE CAT WHO DOES NOT LIKE TO BE RUBBED THE WRONG WAY
9023-296467-0028 WHO DOES LIKE TO BE RUBBED THE WRONG WAY AND WHO OBJECTS TO YOUR TREADING ON HER TAIL NOR IS THE SOFT FOOT WITH ITS SKILFULLY SHEATHED AND EVER SHARP CLAWS WITHOUT A MORAL TOO FOR WHILST THERE IS NOTHING COMMENDABLE IN ANYTHING APPROACHING TO SPITE PASSION OR REVENGE
9023-296467-0029 IT MAY REMIND ONE OF THE PLACID COUNTENANCE AND CALM REPOSE WITH WHICH THE SPHYNX SEEMS TO LOOK FORTH FROM THE SHADOW OF THE PYRAMIDS ON THE CHANGES AND TROUBLES OF THE WORLD THIS LEADS TO THE REMARK THAT CATS AFTER ALL ARE VERY ENIGMATICAL CREATURES
9023-296467-0030 YOU NEVER GET TO THE BOTTOM OF CATS YOU WILL NEVER FIND ANY TWO WELL KNOWN TO YOU THAT DO NOT OFFER MARKED DIVERSITIES IN WAYS AND DISPOSITIONS AND IN GENERAL THE COMBINATION THEY EXHIBIT OF ACTIVITY AND REPOSE
9023-296467-0031 AND THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH THEY PASS FROM THE ONE TO THE OTHER THEIR GENTLE ASPECTS AND FRAGILE FORM UNITED WITH STRENGTH AND PLIANCY THEIR SUDDEN APPEARANCES AND DISAPPEARANCES THEIR TENACITY OF LIFE AND MANY ESCAPES FROM DANGERS AS MANY LIVES AS A CAT
9023-296467-0032 THEIR SILENT AND RAPID MOVEMENTS THEIR SOMETIMES UNACCOUNTABLE GATHERINGS AND STRANGE NOISES AT NIGHT ALL CONTRIBUTE TO INVEST THEM WITH A MYSTERIOUS FASCINATION WHICH REACHES ITS CULMINATING POINT IN THE NOT VERY FREQUENT CASE OF A COMPLETELY BLACK CAT
9023-296467-0033 INSTANCES ARE FREQUENT I AM HAPPY TO TELL CAT HATERS OF ILLUSTRIOUS PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN ATTACHED TO THE FELINE RACE AND OF CATS WHO HAVE MERITED SUCH ATTACHMENT MAHOMET WOULD SEEM TO HAVE BEEN VERY FOND OF CATS
9023-296467-0034 FOR IT IS SAID THAT HE ONCE CUT OFF THE SLEEVE OF HIS ROBE RATHER THAN DISTURB HIS FAVOURITE WHILE SLEEPING ON IT PETRARCH WAS SO FOND OF HIS CAT THAT WHEN IT DIED HE HAD IT EMBALMED AND PLACED IN A NICHE IN HIS APARTMENT AND YOU OUGHT TO READ WHAT ROUSSEAU HAS TO SAY IN FAVOUR OF THE FELINE RACE
9023-296467-0035 IT WAS A LARGE HOUSE WALLED ROUND VERY CAREFULLY AND SAID TO BE FULL OF PATIENTS IT WAS AT DAMASCUS THAT THE INCIDENT ABOVE RELATED OCCURRED TO MAHOMET HIS FOLLOWERS IN THIS PLACE EVER AFTERWARDS PAID A GREAT RESPECT TO CATS
9023-296467-0036 AND SUPPORTED THE HOSPITAL IN QUESTION BY PUBLIC SUBSCRIPTIONS WITH MUCH LIBERALITY WHEN THE DUKE OF NORFOLK WAS COMMITTED TO THE TOWER IN THE REIGN OF QUEEN ELIZABETH A FAVOURITE CAT MADE HER WAY INTO THE PRISON ROOM BY GETTING DOWN THE CHIMNEY
9023-296467-0037 THE FIRST DAY SAYS LADY MORGAN IN HER DELIGHTFUL BOOK WE HAD THE HONOUR OF DINING AT THE PALACE OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF TORONTO AT NAPLES HE SAID TO ME
