1401-146770-0000 CHEDCOMBE AS I SAID IN MY LAST LETTER WE STARTED OUT FOR CHEDCOMBE NOT ABREAST AS WE HAD BEEN BEFORE BUT STRUNG ALONG THE ROAD AND ME AND MISTER POPLINGTON PRETTY DOLEFUL BEING DISAPPOINTED AND NOT WANTING TO TALK
1401-146770-0001 BUT AS FOR JONE HE SEEMED LIVELIER THAN EVER AND WHISTLED A LOT OF TUNES HE DIDN'T KNOW I THINK IT ALWAYS MAKES HIM LIVELY TO GET RID OF SEEING SIGHTS THE SUN WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO EXPECT RAIN FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS ANYWAY
1401-146770-0002 AND THE COUNTRY WE PASSED THROUGH WAS SO FINE WITH HARDLY ANY HOUSES AND WITH GREAT HILLS AND WOODS AND SOMETIMES VALLEYS FAR BELOW THE ROAD WITH STREAMS RUSHING AND BUBBLING THAT AFTER A WHILE I BEGAN TO FEEL BETTER
1401-146770-0003 AND I PRICKED UP MY TRICYCLE AND OF COURSE BEING FOLLOWED BY JONE WE LEFT MISTER POPLINGTON WHOSE MELANCHOLY SEEMED TO HAVE GOTTEN INTO HIS LEGS A GOOD WAY BEHIND WE MUST HAVE TRAVELLED TWO OR THREE HOURS WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I HEARD A NOISE AFAR AND I DREW UP AND LISTENED
1401-146770-0004 THE NOISE WAS THE BARKING OF DOGS AND IT SEEMED TO COME FROM A PIECE OF WOODS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD WHICH LAY TO THE RIGHT OF THE ROAD THE NEXT INSTANT SOMETHING SHOT OUT FROM UNDER THE TREES AND BEGAN GOING OVER THE FIELD IN TEN FOOT HOPS I SAT STARING WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING
1401-146770-0005 BUT WHEN I SAW A LOT OF BROWN AND WHITE SPOTS BOUNCE OUT OF THE WOOD AND SAW A LONG WAY BACK IN THE OPEN FIELD TWO RED COATED MEN ON HORSEBACK THE TRUTH FLASHED UPON ME THAT THIS WAS THE HUNT THE CREATURE IN FRONT WAS THE STAG WHO HAD CHOSEN TO COME THIS WAY
1401-146770-0006 AND THE DOGS AND THE HORSES WAS AFTER HIM AND I WAS HERE TO SEE IT ALL
1401-146770-0007 GOING THE SAME WAY THAT WE WERE IN A SECOND I CLAPPED SPURS INTO MY TRICYCLE AND WAS OFF IN FRONT OF ME WAS A LONG STRETCH OF DOWN GRADE AND OVER THIS I WENT AS FAST AS I COULD WORK MY PEDALS NO BRAKES OR HOLDING BACK FOR ME
1401-146770-0008 MY BLOOD WAS UP FOR I WAS ACTUALLY IN A DEER HUNT AND TO MY AMAZEMENT AND WILD DELIGHT I FOUND I WAS KEEPING UP WITH THE DEER I WAS GOING FASTER THAN THE MEN ON HORSEBACK HI HI I SHOUTED AND DOWN I WENT WITH ONE EYE ON THE DEER AND THE OTHER ON THE ROAD
1401-146770-0009 EVERY ATOM OF MY BODY TINGLING WITH FIERY EXCITEMENT WHEN I BEGAN TO GO UP THE LITTLE SLOPE AHEAD I HEARD JONE PUFFING BEHIND ME YOU WILL BREAK YOUR NECK HE SHOUTED IF YOU GO DOWN HILL THAT WAY AND GETTING CLOSE UP TO ME HE FASTENED HIS CORD TO MY TRICYCLE
1401-146770-0010 BUT I PAID NO ATTENTION TO HIM OR HIS ADVICE THE STAG THE STAG I CRIED AS LONG AS HE KEEPS NEAR THE ROAD WE CAN FOLLOW HIM HI
1401-146770-0011 FOR WE HAD FALLEN BACK A LITTLE AND THE STAG WAS NOW GETTING AHEAD OF US
1401-146770-0012 FOR JONE HELD BACK WITH ALL HIS FORCE AND BOTH FEET ON THE GROUND I EXPECT AND I COULD NOT GET ON AT ALL LET GO OF ME I CRIED WE SHALL LOSE THE STAG
1401-146770-0013 BUT IT WASN'T ANY USE JONE'S HEELS MUST HAVE BEEN NEARLY RUBBED OFF BUT HE HELD BACK LIKE A GOOD FELLOW AND I SEEMED TO BE MOVING ALONG NO FASTER THAN A WORM I COULD NOT STAND THIS MY BLOOD BOILED AND BUBBLED THE DEER WAS GETTING AWAY FROM ME
1401-146770-0014 NOT CARING WHETHER THE ROAD WAS STEEP OR LEVEL A THOUGHT FLASHED ACROSS MY MIND AND I CLAPPED MY HAND INTO MY POCKET AND JERKED OUT A PAIR OF SCISSORS IN AN INSTANT I WAS FREE
1401-146770-0015 THE WORLD AND THE STAG WAS BEFORE ME AND I WAS FLYING ALONG WITH A TORNADO LIKE SWIFTNESS THAT SOON BROUGHT ME ABREAST OF THE DEER THIS PERFECTLY SPLENDID BOUNDING CREATURE WAS NOT FAR AWAY FROM ME ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEDGE AND AS THE FIELD WAS HIGHER THAN THE ROAD I COULD SEE HIM PERFECTLY
1401-146770-0016 THERE WAS STILL THE WOODS ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THE DEER SEEMED TO RUN TO KEEP AWAY FROM THAT AND TO CROSS THE ROAD AND HE CAME NEARER AND NEARER UNTIL I FANCIED HE KEPT AN EYE ON ME AS IF HE WAS WONDERING IF I WAS OF ANY CONSEQUENCE
1401-146770-0017 AND IF I COULD HINDER HIM FROM CROSSING THE ROAD AND GETTING AWAY INTO THE VALLEY BELOW WHERE THERE WAS A REGULAR WILDERNESS OF WOODS AND UNDERBRUSH IF HE DOES THAT I THOUGHT HE WILL BE GONE IN A MINUTE AND I SHALL LOSE HIM AND THE HUNT WILL BE OVER AND FOR FEAR HE WOULD MAKE FOR THE HEDGE AND JUMP OVER IT
1401-146770-0018 AND A LITTLE FARTHER BACK WAS THREE OR FOUR DOGS WITH ANOTHER MAN STILL ON HORSEBACK WHIPPING THEM TO KEEP THEM BACK THOUGH THEY SEEMED WILLING ENOUGH TO LIE THERE WITH THEIR TONGUES OUT PANTING AS THE MAN WITH THE KNIFE CAME UP TO THE DEER THE POOR CREATURE RAISED ITS EYES TO HIM
1401-146770-0019 AND DIDN'T SEEM TO MIND WHETHER HE CAME OR NOT IT WAS TREMBLING ALL OVER AND FAIRLY TIRED TO DEATH WHEN THE MAN GOT NEAR ENOUGH HE TOOK HOLD OF ONE OF THE DEER'S HORNS AND LIFTED UP THE HAND WITH THE KNIFE IN IT BUT HE DIDN'T BRING IT DOWN ON THAT DEER'S THROAT I CAN TELL YOU MADAM
1401-146770-0020 FOR I WAS THERE AND HAD HIM BY THE ARM HE TURNED ON ME AS IF HE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY LIGHTNING WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE SHOUTED LET GO MY ARM DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT DEER SAID I MY VOICE WAS SO HUSKY I COULD HARDLY SPEAK DON'T YOU SEE IT'S SURRENDERED
1401-146770-0021 AND HE HAVING GOT A LITTLE OF HIS WIND BACK JERKED HIS HORN OUT OF THE HAND OF THE MAN AND GIVING A SORT OF SIDE SPRING BACKWARD AMONG THE BUSHES AND ROCKS AWAY HE WENT THE DOGS AFTER HIM
1401-146770-0022 THE MAN WITH THE KNIFE RUSHED OUT INTO THE LANE AND SO DID I AND SO DID THE MAN ON HORSEBACK ALMOST ON TOP OF ME ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LANE WAS A LITTLE GORGE WITH ROCKS AND TREES AND WATER AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
1401-146770-0023 AND I WAS JUST IN TIME TO SEE THE STAG SPRING OVER THE LANE AND DROP OUT OF SIGHT AMONG THE ROCKS AND THE MOSS AND THE VINES THE MAN STOOD AND SWORE AT ME REGARDLESS OF MY SEX SO VIOLENT WAS HIS RAGE IF YOU WAS A MAN I'D BREAK YOUR HEAD HE YELLED
1401-146770-0024 I'M GLAD I'M NOT SAID I FOR I WOULDN'T WANT MY HEAD BROKEN
1401-146770-0025 FOR I NEVER SAW ANYTHING DROP ON ROCKS IN SUCH A RECKLESS MANNER AND THE POOR THING SO TIRED THE MAN SWORE AGAIN AND SAID SOMETHING ABOUT WISHING SOMEBODY ELSE'S LEGS HAD BEEN BROKEN AND THEN HE SHOUTED TO THE MAN ON HORSEBACK TO CALL OFF THE DOGS
1401-146770-0026 WHICH WAS OF NO USE FOR HE WAS DOING IT ALREADY THEN HE TURNED ON ME AGAIN YOU ARE AN AMERICAN HE SHOUTED I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THAT
1401-146770-0027 YOU'RE MISTAKEN THERE I SAID THERE ISN'T A TRUE ENGLISH WOMAN THAT LIVES WHO WOULD NOT HAVE DONE THE SAME THING YOUR MOTHER CONFOUND MY MOTHER YELLED THE MAN ALL RIGHT SAID I THAT'S ALL IN YOUR FAMILY AND NONE OF MY BUSINESS THEN HE WENT OFF RAGING TO WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS HORSE BY A GATEPOST
1401-146770-0028 THE OTHER MAN WHO WAS A GOOD DEAL YOUNGER AND MORE FRIENDLY CAME UP TO ME AND SAID HE WOULDN'T LIKE TO BE IN MY BOOTS FOR I HAD SPOILED A PRETTY PIECE OF SPORT AND THEN HE WENT ON AND TOLD ME THAT IT HAD BEEN A BAD HUNT FOR INSTEAD OF STARTING ONLY ONE STAG
1401-146770-0029 FOR THE HOUNDS AND THE HUNTERS HAD BEEN MIXED UP IN A NASTY WAY
1401-146770-0030 AND WHEN A STAG WAS KILLED IT BELONGED TO THE MAN WHOSE LAND IT DIED ON HE TOLD ME THAT THE MASTER OF THE HUNT GETS THE HEAD AND THE ANTLERS AND THE HUNTSMAN SOME OTHER PART WHICH I FORGET BUT THE OWNER OF THE LAND NO MATTER WHETHER HE'S IN THE HUNT OR NOT GETS THE BODY OF THE STAG
1401-146770-0031 BUT KEEPING A LITTLE BACK OF THEM THOUGH FOR I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE OLDER ONE MIGHT DO IF HE HAPPENED TO TURN AND SEE ME I WAS SURE THAT JONE HAD PASSED THE LITTLE LANE WITHOUT SEEING IT SO I KEPT ON THE WAY WE HAD BEEN GOING AND GOT UP ALL THE SPEED I COULD
1401-146770-0032 THOUGH I MUST SAY I WAS DREADFULLY TIRED AND EVEN TREMBLING A LITTLE FOR WHILE I HAD BEEN STAG HUNTING I WAS SO EXCITED I DIDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH WORK I WAS DOING THERE WAS SIGN POSTS ENOUGH TO TELL ME THE WAY TO CHEDCOMBE AND SO I KEPT STRAIGHT ON UP HILL AND DOWN HILL
1401-146770-0033 WHICH I SOON KNEW TO BE MISTER POPLINGTON HE WAS SURPRISED ENOUGH AT SEEING ME AND TOLD ME MY HUSBAND HAD GONE AHEAD I DIDN'T EXPLAIN ANYTHING AND IT WASN'T UNTIL WE GOT NEARLY TO CHEDCOMBE THAT WE MET JONE
