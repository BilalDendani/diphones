2792-144136-0000 SHOUTED TO THE COACHMAN RIGHT AWAY THE REASON OF ALL THIS WAS THAT THE LADY WAS THE POSSESSOR OF A PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE
2792-144136-0001 EVERY MOMENT SHE KEPT LOOKING OUT OF THE CARRIAGE WINDOW AND PERCEIVING WITH ALMOST SPEECHLESS VEXATION THAT AS YET SHE WAS BUT HALF WAY ON HER JOURNEY
2792-144136-0002 THE FRONTS OF THE HOUSES APPEARED TO HER LONGER THAN USUAL AND IN PARTICULAR DID THE FRONT OF THE WHITE STONE HOSPITAL WITH ITS ROWS OF NARROW WINDOWS SEEM INTERMINABLE
2792-144136-0003 WHICH AT LENGTH FORCED HER TO EJACULATE OH THE CURSED BUILDING POSITIVELY THERE IS NO END TO IT ALSO
2792-144136-0004 GO QUICKER ANDRUSHA YOU ARE A HORRIBLY LONG TIME OVER THE JOURNEY THIS MORNING BUT AT LENGTH THE GOAL WAS REACHED AND THE KOLIASKA STOPPED BEFORE A ONE STORIED WOODEN MANSION DARK GREY IN COLOUR AND
2792-144136-0005 HAVING WHITE CARVINGS OVER THE WINDOWS A TALL WOODEN FENCE AND NARROW GARDEN IN FRONT OF THE LATTER AND A FEW MEAGRE TREES LOOMING WHITE WITH AN INCONGRUOUS COATING OF ROAD DUST IN THE WINDOWS OF THE BUILDING WERE ALSO A FEW FLOWER POTS
2792-144136-0006 AND A PARROT THAT KEPT ALTERNATELY DANCING ON THE FLOOR OF ITS CAGE AND HANGING ON TO THE RING OF THE SAME WITH ITS BEAK ALSO IN THE SUNSHINE BEFORE THE DOOR TWO PET DOGS WERE SLEEPING HERE
2792-144136-0007 THERE LIVED THE LADY'S BOSOM FRIEND AS SOON AS THE BOSOM FRIEND IN QUESTION LEARNT OF THE NEWCOMER'S ARRIVAL SHE RAN DOWN INTO THE HALL AND THE TWO LADIES KISSED AND EMBRACED ONE ANOTHER
2792-144136-0008 WHEN I HEARD SOME ONE ARRIVING I WONDERED WHO COULD POSSIBLY BE CALLING SO EARLY PARASHA DECLARED THAT IT MUST BE THE VICE GOVERNOR'S WIFE SO AS I DID NOT WANT TO BE BORED WITH HER I GAVE ORDERS THAT I WAS TO BE REPORTED
2792-144136-0009 NOT AT HOME FOR HER PART THE GUEST WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE PROCEEDED TO BUSINESS BY COMMUNICATING HER TIDINGS BUT A SUDDEN EXCLAMATION FROM THE HOSTESS IMPARTED TEMPORARILY A NEW DIRECTION TO THE CONVERSATION
2792-144136-0010 WHAT A PRETTY CHINTZ SHE CRIED GAZING AT THE OTHER'S GOWN YES IT IS PRETTY AGREED THE VISITOR
2792-144136-0011 PRASKOVIA THEDOROVNA THINKS THAT IN OTHER WORDS THE LADIES PROCEEDED TO INDULGE IN A CONVERSATION ON THE SUBJECT OF DRESS AND ONLY AFTER THIS HAD LASTED FOR A CONSIDERABLE WHILE
2792-144136-0012 DID THE VISITOR LET FALL A REMARK WHICH LED HER ENTERTAINER TO INQUIRE AND HOW IS THE UNIVERSAL CHARMER
2792-144136-0013 AND THE VISITOR'S BREATHING BECAME MORE HURRIED AND FURTHER WORDS SEEMED TO BE HOVERING BETWEEN HER LIPS LIKE HAWKS PREPARING TO STOOP UPON THEIR PREY ONLY A PERSON OF THE UNHUMANITY OF A TRUE FRIEND WOULD HAVE HAD THE HEART TO INTERRUPT HER
2792-144136-0014 I WONDER HOW ANY ONE CAN SEE ANYTHING IN THE MAN TO PRAISE OR TO ADMIRE
2792-144136-0015 THAT HE IS A PERFECT RASCAL
2792-144136-0016 OH I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE THINK HIM HANDSOME CONTINUED THE HOSTESS UNMOVED
2792-144136-0017 HIS NOSE IS PERFECTLY ODIOUS YES
2792-144136-0018 THE GUEST'S TONE WAS ALMOST PITEOUS IN ITS APPEAL WHAT IS IT THEN YOU CANNOT IMAGINE MY STATE OF MIND YOU SEE THIS MORNING I RECEIVED A VISIT FROM FATHER CYRIL'S WIFE THE ARCHPRIEST'S WIFE YOU KNOW HER DON'T YOU
2792-144136-0019 OH DEAR NO HAD THAT BEEN ALL
2792-144136-0020 LISTEN TO WHAT FATHER CYRIL'S WIFE HAD TO TELL ME SHE SAID THAT
2792-144136-0021 ARRIVED ALL PALE AND TREMBLING AND TOLD HER OH SUCH THINGS
2792-144136-0022 THERE CAME THE MOST DREADFUL KNOCKING IMAGINABLE AND SOME ONE SCREAMED OUT
2792-144136-0023 JUST THINK AFTER THIS HOW ANY ONE CAN SAY THAT THE MAN IS CHARMING I CANNOT IMAGINE
2792-144136-0024 IS SHE A YOUNG WOMAN OR GOOD LOOKING OH DEAR NO QUITE AN OLD WOMAN SPLENDID INDEED
2792-144136-0025 ONE MAY HEARTILY COMMEND THE TASTE OF OUR LADIES FOR HAVING FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HIM NEVERTHELESS IT IS NOT AS YOU SUPPOSE THINK NOW
2792-144136-0026 OF COURSE MADAME KOROBOTCHKA ANSWERED REASONABLY ENOUGH I CANNOT SELL YOU THOSE SOULS
2792-144136-0027 BUT HE REPLIED NO NO THEY ARE NOT DEAD TIS I WHO TELL YOU THAT
2792-144136-0028 I SWEAR THAT THEY ARE STILL ALIVE IN SHORT HE MADE SUCH A SCENE THAT THE WHOLE VILLAGE CAME RUNNING TO THE HOUSE AND CHILDREN SCREAMED AND MEN SHOUTED
2792-144136-0029 THE AFFAIR SEEMED TO ME SO HORRIBLE SO UTTERLY HORRIBLE THAT I TREMBLED BEYOND BELIEF
2792-144136-0030 MY DEAREST MADAM SAID MY MAID MASHKA PRAY LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR AND SEE HOW WHITE YOU ARE BUT I HAVE NO TIME FOR THAT I REPLIED AS I MUST BE OFF TO TELL MY FRIEND ANNA GRIGORIEVNA
2792-144136-0031 THE NEWS NOR DID I LOSE A MOMENT IN ORDERING THE KOLIASKA YET WHEN MY COACHMAN ANDRUSHA ASKED ME FOR DIRECTIONS
2792-144136-0032 UNTIL I THOUGHT HE MUST THINK ME MAD
2792-144136-0033 I CONFESS THAT THE WORDS PASS MY UNDERSTANDING CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE HEARD SPEAK OF THOSE SOULS TRUE MY HUSBAND AVERS THAT NOZDREV WAS LYING YET IN HIS LIES THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A GRAIN OF TRUTH WELL
2792-144136-0034 I AM ALTOGETHER AT A LOSS WHAT TO DO
2792-144136-0035 THAT SUCH THINGS SHOULD HAPPEN TRY AND IMAGINE MY FEELINGS IN MY OPINION THERE IS IN THIS MORE THAN THE DEAD SOULS WHICH MEET THE EYE I THINK SO TOO AGREED THE OTHER AS A MATTER OF FACT HER FRIEND'S REMARK HAD STRUCK HER WITH COMPLETE SURPRISE
2792-144136-0036 IN FACT SHE FELT DRIVEN TO INQUIRE WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE TO BE HIDDEN BENEATH IT ALL NO TELL ME
2792-144136-0037 YES BUT TELL ME WHAT IS IN YOUR MIND UPON THIS THE VISITOR HAD TO CONFESS HERSELF NONPLUSSED FOR THOUGH CAPABLE OF GROWING HYSTERICAL SHE WAS INCAPABLE OF PROPOUNDING ANY RATIONAL THEORY
2792-144136-0038 CONSEQUENTLY SHE FELT THE MORE THAT SHE NEEDED TENDER COMFORT AND ADVICE
2792-144136-0039 OR RATHER THEY PRICKED THEMSELVES UP AND STRAIGHTENED HERSELF AND BECAME SOMEHOW MORE MODISH AND DESPITE HER NOT INCONSIDERABLE WEIGHT POSED HERSELF TO LOOK LIKE A PIECE OF THISTLEDOWN FLOATING ON THE BREEZE THE DEAD SOULS BEGAN THE HOSTESS
2792-144136-0040 ARE WHAT ARE WHAT INQUIRED THE GUEST IN GREAT EXCITEMENT ARE ARE TELL ME TELL ME FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE
2792-144136-0041 TO ABDUCT THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER
2792-144136-0042 PETRIFIED GENUINE AMAZEMENT MY GOD SHE CRIED
2792-144136-0043 I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED IT WELL TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I GUESSED IT AS SOON AS EVER YOU OPENED YOUR MOUTH SO MUCH THEN FOR EDUCATING GIRLS LIKE THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER AT SCHOOL JUST SEE WHAT COMES OF IT
2792-144136-0044 TRULY IT WRINGS ONE'S HEART TO SEE TO WHAT LENGTHS IMMORALITY HAS COME SOME OF THE MEN HAVE QUITE LOST THEIR HEADS ABOUT HER BUT FOR MY PART I THINK HER NOT WORTH NOTICING OF COURSE AND HER MANNERS ARE UNBEARABLE
2792-144136-0045 BUT WHAT PUZZLES ME MOST IS HOW A TRAVELLED MAN LIKE CHICHIKOV COULD COME TO LET HIMSELF IN FOR SUCH AN AFFAIR SURELY HE MUST HAVE ACCOMPLICES YES AND I SHOULD SAY THAT ONE OF THOSE ACCOMPLICES IS NOZDREV SURELY NOT
2792-144136-0046 CERTAINLY I SHOULD SAY SO WHY I HAVE KNOWN HIM EVEN TRY TO SELL HIS OWN FATHER AT ALL EVENTS HE STAKED HIM AT CARDS
2792-144136-0047 I SHOULD NEVER HAD THOUGHT HIM CAPABLE OF SUCH THINGS I ALWAYS GUESSED HIM TO BE SO THE TWO LADIES WERE STILL DISCUSSING THE MATTER WITH ACUMEN
2792-144136-0048 PROBABLY BECAUSE THE FUNCTION IN LIFE OF ITS MEMBERS HAD ALWAYS BEEN THAT OF MANAGING AND ADMINISTERING A HOUSEHOLD WITH THE LADIES THEREFORE MATTERS SOON ASSUMED VIVID AND DEFINITE SHAPE THEY BECAME CLEARLY
2792-144136-0049 AND IRREFUTABLY MATERIALISED THEY STOOD STRIPPED OF ALL DOUBT AND OTHER IMPEDIMENTA SAID SOME OF THE LADIES IN QUESTION CHICHIKOV HAD LONG BEEN IN LOVE WITH THE MAIDEN
2792-144136-0050 SEEING THAT CHICHIKOV WAS AS RICH AS A JEW BUT
2792-144136-0051 HOW THE WORTHY DAMES CAME TO KNOW THAT HE WAS MARRIED REMAINS A MYSTERY AND THE SAID DESERTED WIFE
2792-144136-0052 HAD DECIDED TO ABDUCT THE GIRL IN OTHER CIRCLES THE MATTER WAS STATED IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAT IS TO SAY
2792-144136-0053 BUT THAT AS A MAN OF SUBTLETY AND EXPERIENCE HE HAD BETHOUGHT HIM OF OBTAINING THE DAUGHTER'S HAND
2792-144136-0054 AND CARRYING ON WITH HER AN ARDENT LIAISON AND THAT THEREAFTER HE HAD MADE AN APPLICATION FOR THE DESIRED HAND BUT THAT THE MOTHER FEARING TO COMMIT A SIN AGAINST RELIGION AND FEELING IN HER HEART CERTAIN GNAWINGS OF CONSCIENCE
2792-144136-0055 WHEREUPON CHICHIKOV HAD DECIDED TO CARRY OUT THE ABDUCTION ALLEGED TO THE FOREGOING OF COURSE THERE BECAME APPENDED VARIOUS ADDITIONAL PROOFS AND ITEMS OF EVIDENCE
2792-144136-0056 IN PROPORTION AS THE SENSATION SPREAD TO MORE REMOTE CORNERS OF THE TOWN AT LENGTH WITH THESE PERFECTINGS
2792-144136-0057 NATURALLY AS THE MOTHER OF A FAMILY AND AS THE FIRST LADY IN THE TOWN
2792-144136-0058 SHE WAS HIGHLY OFFENDED WHEN SHE HEARD THE STORIES AND VERY JUSTLY SO
2792-144136-0059 THOUGH INNOCENT HAD TO ENDURE ABOUT AS UNPLEASANT A TETE A TETE AS EVER BEFELL A MAIDEN OF SIXTEEN WHILE FOR HIS PART THE SWISS FOOTMAN RECEIVED ORDERS NEVER AT ANY TIME
2792-144136-0060 HAVING DONE THEIR BUSINESS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE THE LADIES PARTY DESCENDED UPON THE MALE SECTION WITH A VIEW TO INFLUENCING IT TO THEIR OWN SIDE BY ASSERTING THAT THE DEAD SOULS
2792-144136-0061 AND SUCCESSFULLY AFFECTING THE ABDUCTION AND INDEED MORE THAN ONE MAN WAS CONVERTED AND JOINED THE FEMININE CAMP IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THEREBY SUCH SECEDERS INCURRED STRONG NAMES FROM THEIR LATE COMRADES
2792-144136-0062 NAMES SUCH AS OLD WOMEN PETTICOATS
2792-144136-0063 ALSO HOWEVER MUCH THEY MIGHT ARM THEMSELVES AND TAKE THE FIELD THE MEN COULD NOT COMPASS SUCH ORDERLINESS WITHIN THEIR RANKS AS COULD THE WOMEN WITH THE FORMER EVERYTHING WAS OF THE ANTIQUATED
2792-144136-0064 AND ROUGH HEWN AND ILL FITTING AND UNSUITABLE AND BADLY ADAPTED AND INFERIOR KIND THEIR HEADS WERE FULL OF NOTHING BUT DISCORD AND TRIVIALITY AND CONFUSION AND SLOVENLINESS OF THOUGHT
2792-144136-0065 IN BRIEF THEY DISPLAYED EVERYWHERE THE MALE BENT THE RUDE
2792-144136-0066 OR OF JUMPING TO A CONCLUSION
2792-144136-0067 AND EVERLASTING TIMIDITY FOR INSTANCE THE MEN'S PARTY DECLARED THAT THE WHOLE STORY WAS RUBBISH THAT THE ALLEGED ABDUCTION OF THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER
2792-144136-0068 WHEN THEY ACCUSED CHICHIKOV OF THE DEED THAT A WOMAN WAS LIKE A MONEY BAG WHATSOEVER YOU PUT INTO HER SHE THENCEFORTH RETAINED THAT THE SUBJECT WHICH REALLY DEMANDED ATTENTION WAS THE DEAD SOULS OF WHICH THE DEVIL ONLY KNEW THE MEANING
2792-144136-0069 ONE REASON WHY THE MEN'S PARTY WAS SO CERTAIN THAT THE DEAD SOULS CONNOTED SOMETHING CONTRARY TO GOOD ORDER AND DISCIPLINE WAS THAT THERE HAD JUST BEEN APPOINTED
2792-144136-0070 A NEW GOVERNOR GENERAL AN EVENT WHICH OF COURSE HAD THROWN THE WHOLE ARMY OF PROVINCIAL TCHINOVNIKS INTO A STATE OF GREAT EXCITEMENT SEEING THAT THEY KNEW THAT BEFORE LONG THERE WOULD ENSUE TRANSFERMENTS AND SENTENCES OF CENSURE
2792-144136-0071 AS WELL AS THE SERIES OF OFFICIAL DINNERS
2792-144136-0072 ALAS THOUGHT THE ARMY OF TCHINOVNIKS IT IS PROBABLE THAT SHOULD HE LEARN OF THE GROSS REPORTS AT PRESENT AFLOAT IN OUR TOWN HE WILL MAKE SUCH A FUSS THAT WE SHALL NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF THEM
2792-144136-0073 IN PARTICULAR DID THE DIRECTOR OF THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT TURN PALE AT THE THOUGHT THAT POSSIBLY THE NEW GOVERNOR GENERAL WOULD SURMISE THE TERM DEAD FOLK TO CONNOTE PATIENTS IN THE LOCAL HOSPITALS WHO FOR WANT OF PROPER PREVENTATIVE MEASURES
2792-144136-0074 INDEED MIGHT IT NOT BE THAT CHICHIKOV WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN AN EMISSARY OF THE SAID GOVERNOR GENERAL SENT TO CONDUCT A SECRET INQUIRY
2792-144136-0075 COMMUNICATED THIS LAST SUPPOSITION TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL WHO THOUGH AT FIRST INCLINED TO EJACULATE RUBBISH SUDDENLY TURNED PALE ON PROPOUNDING TO HIMSELF THE THEORY
2792-144136-0076 A TERRIBLE THOUGHT CONSIDERING THAT HE THE PRESIDENT
2792-144136-0077 AND HAD HIMSELF ACTED AS PLUSHKIN'S REPRESENTATIVE WHAT IF THESE THINGS SHOULD REACH THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S EARS HE MENTIONED THE MATTER TO ONE FRIEND AND ANOTHER AND THEY IN THEIR TURN
2792-144136-0078 AND IS EVEN MORE DESTRUCTIVE THAN THE DREADED BLACK DEATH ALSO TO ADD TO THE TCHINOVNIKS TROUBLES
2792-144136-0079 TWO DOCUMENTS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THE FIRST OF THEM CONTAINED ADVICES THAT ACCORDING TO RECEIVED EVIDENCE AND REPORTS THERE WAS OPERATING IN THE PROVINCE A FORGER OF ROUBLE NOTES WHO HAD BEEN PASSING UNDER VARIOUS ALIASES
2792-144136-0080 AND MUST THEREFORE BE SOUGHT FOR WITH THE UTMOST DILIGENCE WHILE THE SECOND DOCUMENT WAS A LETTER FROM THE GOVERNOR OF A NEIGHBOURING PROVINCE WITH REGARD TO A MALEFACTOR WHO HAD THERE EVADED APPREHENSION A LETTER CONVEYING ALSO A WARNING THAT
2792-144136-0081 IF IN THE PROVINCE OF THE TOWN OF N THERE SHOULD APPEAR ANY SUSPICIOUS INDIVIDUAL WHO COULD PRODUCE NEITHER REFERENCES NOR PASSPORTS HE WAS TO BE ARRESTED FORTHWITH THESE TWO DOCUMENTS LEFT EVERY ONE THUNDERSTRUCK
2792-144136-0082 FOR THEY KNOCKED ON THE HEAD ALL PREVIOUS CONCEPTIONS AND THEORIES NOT FOR A MOMENT COULD IT BE SUPPOSED THAT THE FORMER DOCUMENT REFERRED TO CHICHIKOV YET AS EACH MAN PONDERED THE POSITION FROM HIS OWN POINT OF VIEW
2792-144136-0083 AS ALSO THAT HIS VAGUE REFERENCES TO HIMSELF HAD YES INCLUDED STATEMENTS THAT HIS CAREER IN THE SERVICE
2792-144136-0084 THIS GAVE THE TCHINOVNIKS FURTHER FOOD FOR THOUGHT PERHAPS HIS LIFE REALLY DID STAND IN DANGER PERHAPS
2792-144136-0085 AS A MATTER OF FACT WHO WAS HE NOT THAT IT COULD ACTUALLY BE SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS A FORGER OF NOTES STILL LESS A BRIGAND SEEING THAT HIS EXTERIOR WAS RESPECTABLE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE YET WHO WAS HE
2792-144136-0086 AT LENGTH THE TCHINOVNIKS DECIDED TO MAKE ENQUIRIES AMONG THOSE OF WHOM
2792-144136-0087 IN ORDER THAT AT LEAST IT MIGHT BE LEARNT
2792-144136-0088 AND WHAT EXACTLY UNDERLAY THEM AND WHETHER IN PASSING HE HAD EXPLAINED TO ANY ONE HIS REAL INTENTIONS OR REVEALED TO ANY ONE HIS IDENTITY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THEREFORE RESORT WAS HAD TO KOROBOTCHKA
2792-144136-0089 YET LITTLE WAS GLEANED FROM THAT SOURCE MERELY A STATEMENT THAT HE HAD BOUGHT OF HER SOME SOULS FOR FIFTEEN ROUBLES APIECE AND ALSO A QUANTITY OF FEATHERS WHILE PROMISING ALSO TO BUY SOME OTHER COMMODITIES IN THE FUTURE
2792-144136-0090 SEEING THAT IN PARTICULAR HE HAD ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT WITH THE TREASURY FOR LARD A FACT CONSTITUTING FAIRLY PRESUMPTIVE PROOF THAT THE MAN WAS A ROGUE SEEING THAT JUST SUCH ANOTHER FELLOW
2792-144136-0091 AND IN PARTICULAR HAD DONE THE ARCHPRIEST OUT OF OVER A HUNDRED ROUBLES THUS THE NET RESULT OF MADAME'S CROSS EXAMINATION WAS TO CONVINCE THE TCHINOVNIKS THAT SHE WAS A GARRULOUS SILLY OLD WOMAN
2792-144136-0092 WITH REGARD TO MANILOV HE REPLIED THAT HE WOULD ANSWER FOR CHICHIKOV AS HE WOULD FOR HIMSELF
2792-144136-0093 WHICH PAUL IVANOVITCH POSSESSED FINALLY HE DELIVERED ON CHICHIKOV WITH ACUTELY KNITTED BROWS A EULOGY COUCHED IN THE MOST CHARMING OF TERMS AND COUPLED WITH SUNDRY SENTIMENTS ON THE SUBJECT OF FRIENDSHIP AND AFFECTION IN GENERAL
2792-144136-0094 TRUE THESE REMARKS SUFFICED TO INDICATE THE TENDER IMPULSES OF THE SPEAKER'S HEART BUT ALSO THEY DID NOTHING TO ENLIGHTEN HIS EXAMINERS CONCERNING THE BUSINESS THAT WAS ACTUALLY AT HAND AS FOR SOBAKEVITCH
2792-144136-0095 THAT LANDOWNER REPLIED THAT HE CONSIDERED CHICHIKOV AN EXCELLENT FELLOW AS WELL AS THAT THE SOULS WHOM HE HAD SOLD TO HIS VISITOR HAD BEEN IN THE TRUEST SENSE OF THE WORD ALIVE BUT THAT HE COULD NOT ANSWER FOR ANYTHING
2792-144136-0096 WHICH MIGHT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE SEEING THAT ANY DIFFICULTIES WHICH MIGHT ARISE IN THE COURSE OF THE ACTUAL TRANSFERMENT OF SOULS WOULD NOT BE HIS FAULT IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT GOD WAS LORD OF ALL AND THAT FEVERS AND OTHER MORTAL COMPLAINTS
2792-144136-0097 AND THAT INSTANCES OF WHOLE VILLAGES PERISHING THROUGH THE SAME COULD BE FOUND ON RECORD FINALLY OUR FRIENDS THE TCHINOVNIKS FOUND THEMSELVES COMPELLED TO RESORT TO AN EXPEDIENT WHICH
2792-144136-0098 THOUGH NOT PARTICULARLY SAVOURY IS NOT INFREQUENTLY EMPLOYED NAMELY THE EXPEDIENT OF GETTING LACQUEYS QUIETLY TO APPROACH THE SERVANTS OF THE PERSON CONCERNING WHOM INFORMATION IS DESIRED
2792-144136-0099 AND TO ASCERTAIN FROM THEM THE SERVANTS CERTAIN DETAILS WITH REGARD TO THEIR MASTER'S LIFE AND ANTECEDENTS YET EVEN FROM THIS SOURCE
2792-144136-0100 PROVIDED HIS INTERROGATORS MERELY WITH A TASTE OF THE SMELL OF HIS LIVING ROOM AND SELIFAN CONFINED HIS REPLIES
2792-144136-0101 AND ALSO HAD SERVED IN THE CUSTOMS IN SHORT THE SUM TOTAL OF THE RESULTS GATHERED BY THE TCHINOVNIKS WAS THAT THEY STILL STOOD IN IGNORANCE OF CHICHIKOV'S IDENTITY BUT THAT HE MUST BE SOME ONE WHEREFORE
2792-144136-0102 IT WAS DECIDED TO HOLD A FINAL DEBATE ON THE SUBJECT ON WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE AND WHO CHICHIKOV COULD POSSIBLY BE
