7434-96672-0011 THE HARD GROUND WAS TORN UP BY THE PLOW OF ADAMANT AND THE CLODS GROANED AS THEY WERE CAST UP JASON FLUNG THE TEETH BETWEEN THE OPEN SODS OFTEN TURNING HIS HEAD IN FEAR THAT THE DEADLY CROP OF THE EARTH BORN MEN WERE RISING BEHIND HIM
7434-96672-0012 AS YET THE FURROWS WERE FREE OF THE EARTH BORN MEN JASON WENT DOWN TO THE RIVER AND FILLED HIS HELMET FULL OF WATER AND DRANK DEEPLY AND HIS KNEES THAT WERE STIFFENED WITH THE PLOWING HE BENT UNTIL THEY WERE MADE SUPPLE AGAIN
7434-96672-0013 HE SAW THE FIELD RISING INTO MOUNDS
7434-96672-0014 THEN HE SAW SPEARS AND SHIELDS AND HELMETS RISING UP OUT OF THE EARTH THEN ARMED WARRIORS SPRANG UP A FIERCE BATTLE CRY UPON THEIR LIPS JASON REMEMBERED THE COUNSEL OF MEDEA

7434-96672-0018 AND THE FURROWS RAN WITH THEIR DARK BLOOD AS CHANNELS RUN WITH WATER IN SPRINGTIME THE ARGONAUTS SHOUTED LOUDLY FOR JASON'S VICTORY
7434-96672-0019 DAY FADED AND JASON'S CONTEST WAS ENDED
7434-96672-0020 IN THE ASSEMBLY PLACE WITH HIS SON APSYRTUS BESIDE HIM AND WITH THE FURIOUS COLCHIANS ALL AROUND HIM THE KING STOOD
7434-96672-0021 AND ON HIS HEAD WAS THAT GOLDEN HELMET WITH ITS FOUR PLUMES THAT MADE HIM LOOK AS IF HE WERE TRULY THE SON OF HELIOS THE SUN LIGHTNINGS FLASHED FROM HIS GREAT EYES
7434-96672-0022 HOLDING IN HIS HAND HIS BRONZE TOPPED SPEAR HE WOULD HAVE THEM ATTACK THE STRANGERS AND BURN THE ARGO HE WOULD HAVE THE SONS OF PHRIXUS SLAIN FOR BRINGING THEM TO AEA THERE WAS A PROPHECY HE DECLARED

7434-96672-0027 AND THEN SHE CUT OFF A TRESS OF HER HAIR AND SHE LEFT IT IN HER CHAMBER AS A FAREWELL FROM ONE WHO WAS GOING AFAR INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE CHALCIOPE WAS SHE WHISPERED FAREWELL THE PALACE DOORS WERE ALL HEAVILY BOLTED
7434-96672-0028 BUT MEDEA DID NOT HAVE TO PULL BACK THE BOLTS AS SHE CHANTED HER MAGIC SONG THE BOLTS SOFTLY DREW BACK THE DOORS SOFTLY OPENED SWIFTLY SHE WENT ALONG THE WAYS THAT LED TO THE RIVER
7434-96672-0029 SHE CALLED TO THEM AND PHRONTIS
7434-96672-0030 HEARD THE CRY AND KNEW THE VOICE TO JASON HE SPOKE AND JASON QUICKLY WENT TO WHERE MEDEA STOOD SHE CLASPED JASON'S HAND AND SHE DREW HIM WITH HER THE GOLDEN FLEECE SHE SAID
7434-96672-0031 WHEN SHE SAID THESE WORDS ALL JASON'S BEING BECAME TAUT LIKE THE STRING OF A BOW IT WAS THEN THE HOUR WHEN HUNTSMEN CAST SLEEP FROM THEIR EYES HUNTSMEN WHO NEVER SLEEP AWAY THE END OF THE NIGHT

7434-96672-0033 THEN JASON SAW SOMETHING THAT WAS LIKE A CLOUD FILLED WITH THE LIGHT OF THE RISING SUN IT HUNG FROM A GREAT OAK TREE
7434-96672-0034 KNOWING THAT AT LAST HE LOOKED UPON THE GOLDEN FLEECE HIS HAND LET SLIP MEDEA'S HAND AND HE WENT TO SEIZE THE FLEECE AS HE DID HE HEARD A DREADFUL HISS
7434-96672-0035 AND THEN HE SAW THE GUARDIAN OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE COILED ALL AROUND THE TREE WITH OUTSTRETCHED NECK AND KEEN AND SLEEPLESS EYES WAS A DEADLY SERPENT ITS HISS RAN ALL THROUGH THE GROVE AND THE BIRDS THAT WERE WAKENING UP SQUAWKED IN TERROR
7434-96672-0036 LIKE RINGS OF SMOKE THAT RISE ONE ABOVE THE OTHER THE COILS OF THE SERPENT WENT AROUND THE TREE COILS COVERED BY HARD AND GLEAMING SCALES
7434-96672-0037 THEN MEDEA DROPPED ON HER KNEES BEFORE IT AND BEGAN TO CHANT HER MAGIC SONG AS SHE SANG THE COILS AROUND THE TREE GREW SLACK LIKE A DARK NOISELESS WAVE THE SERPENT SANK DOWN ON THE GROUND
7434-96672-0038 BUT STILL ITS JAWS WERE OPEN AND THOSE DREADFUL JAWS THREATENED JASON MEDEA WITH A NEWLY CUT SPRAY OF JUNIPER DIPPED IN A MYSTIC BREW TOUCHED ITS DEADLY EYES AND STILL SHE CHANTED HER MAGIC SONG
7434-96672-0039 THE SERPENT'S JAWS CLOSED ITS EYES BECAME DEADENED FAR THROUGH THE GROVE ITS LENGTH WAS STRETCHED OUT THEN JASON TOOK THE GOLDEN FLEECE AS HE RAISED HIS HANDS TO IT
7434-96672-0040 ITS BRIGHTNESS WAS SUCH AS TO MAKE A FLAME ON HIS FACE MEDEA CALLED TO HIM
7434-96672-0041 MEDEA WAS BESIDE HIM AND THEY WENT SWIFTLY ON THEY CAME TO THE RIVER AND DOWN TO THE PLACE WHERE THE ARGO WAS MOORED THE HEROES WHO WERE ABOARD STARTED UP ASTONISHED TO SEE THE FLEECE THAT SHONE AS WITH THE LIGHTNING OF ZEUS

7434-96672-0043 NOW HAVE WE THE HOPE OF LOOKING UPON OUR FATHERS AND OUR FRIENDS ONCE MORE
7434-96672-0044 THEN HE DREW HIS SWORD AND CUT THE HAWSERS OF THE SHIP CALLING UPON THE HEROES TO DRIVE THE ARGO ON THERE WAS A DIN AND A STRAIN AND A SPLASH OF OARS AND AWAY FROM AEA THE ARGO DASHED
