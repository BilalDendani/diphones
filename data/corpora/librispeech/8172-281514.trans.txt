8172-281514-0000 BUT ROME IS AS THE DESERT WHERE WE STEER STUMBLING O'ER RECOLLECTIONS
8172-281514-0001 AND LIVY'S PICTURED PAGE BUT THESE SHALL BE HER RESURRECTION ALL BESIDE
8172-281514-0002 AND THAT SO SUPINE BY AUGHT THAN ROMANS ROME SHOULD THUS BE LAID SHE WHO WAS NAMED ETERNAL
8172-281514-0003 BUT BENEATH HIS FATE THE MORAL LURKS OF DESTINY HIS DAY OF DOUBLE VICTORY AND DEATH BEHELD HIM WIN TWO REALMS
8172-281514-0004 ON THE SELF SAME DAY DEPOSED HIM GENTLY FROM HIS THRONE OF FORCE
8172-281514-0005 AT THY BATHED BASE THE BLOODY CAESAR LIE FOLDING HIS ROBE IN DYING DIGNITY AN OFFERING TO THINE ALTAR FROM THE QUEEN OF GODS AND MEN GREAT NEMESIS
8172-281514-0006 HAVE YE BEEN VICTORS OF COUNTLESS KINGS
8172-281514-0007 AND THOU THE THUNDER STRICKEN NURSE OF ROME SHE WOLF WHOSE BRAZEN IMAGED DUGS IMPART THE MILK OF CONQUEST YET WITHIN THE DOME WHERE
8172-281514-0008 AS A MONUMENT OF ANTIQUE ART THOU STANDEST MOTHER OF THE MIGHTY HEART WHICH THE GREAT FOUNDER SUCKED FROM THY WILD TEAT
8172-281514-0009 AND THY LIMBS BLACKED WITH LIGHTNING DOST THOU YET GUARD THINE IMMORTAL CUBS
8172-281514-0010 BUT ALL THY FOSTER BABES ARE DEAD THE MEN OF IRON
8172-281514-0011 MEN BLED IN IMITATION OF THE THINGS THEY FEARED
8172-281514-0012 SAVE ONE VAIN MAN WHO IS NOT IN THE GRAVE
8172-281514-0013 AND A KIND OF BASTARD CAESAR FOLLOWING HIM OF OLD WITH STEPS UNEQUAL FOR THE ROMAN'S MIND WAS MODELLED IN A LESS TERRESTRIAL MOULD WITH PASSIONS FIERCER YET A JUDGMENT COLD
8172-281514-0014 AND AN IMMORTAL INSTINCT WHICH REDEEMED THE FRAILTIES OF A HEART SO SOFT YET BOLD
8172-281514-0015 AND CONQUERED BUT THE MAN WHO WOULD HAVE TAMED HIS EAGLES DOWN TO FLEE LIKE A TRAINED FALCON IN THE GALLIC VAN WHICH HE IN SOOTH LONG LED TO VICTORY
8172-281514-0016 WITH A DEAF HEART WHICH NEVER SEEMED TO BE A LISTENER TO ITSELF WAS STRANGELY FRAMED WITH BUT ONE WEAKEST WEAKNESS VANITY COQUETTISH IN AMBITION
8172-281514-0017 STILL HE AIMED AT WHAT
8172-281514-0018 NOR COULD WAIT FOR THE SURE GRAVE TO LEVEL HIM FEW YEARS HAD FIXED HIM WITH THE CAESARS IN HIS FATE ON WHOM WE TREAD FOR THIS THE CONQUEROR REARS THE ARCH OF TRIUMPH
8172-281514-0019 AND FOR THIS THE TEARS AND BLOOD OF EARTH FLOW ON AS THEY HAVE FLOWED AN UNIVERSAL DELUGE WHICH APPEARS WITHOUT AN ARK FOR WRETCHED MAN'S ABODE
8172-281514-0020 LIFE SHORT AND TRUTH A GEM WHICH LOVES THE DEEP AND ALL THINGS WEIGHED IN CUSTOM'S FALSEST SCALE
