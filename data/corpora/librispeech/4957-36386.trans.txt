4957-36386-0000 THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO CONVICTION FOR MURDER UNTIL THE BODY OF THE MURDERED PERSON WAS FOUND OR PROOF OF ITS DESTRUCTION OBTAINED BEYOND A DOUBT WE DENIED THAT SUFFICIENT PROOF HAD BEEN OBTAINED IN THE CASE NOW BEFORE THE COURT THE JUDGES CONSULTED AND DECIDED THAT THE TRIAL SHOULD GO ON
4957-36386-0001 WE TOOK OUR NEXT OBJECTION WHEN THE CONFESSIONS WERE PRODUCED IN EVIDENCE WE DECLARED THAT THEY HAD BEEN EXTORTED BY TERROR OR BY UNDUE INFLUENCE AND WE POINTED OUT CERTAIN MINOR PARTICULARS IN WHICH THE TWO CONFESSIONS FAILED TO CORROBORATE EACH OTHER
4957-36386-0002 FOR THE REST OUR DEFENSE ON THIS OCCASION WAS AS TO ESSENTIALS WHAT OUR DEFENSE HAD BEEN AT THE INQUIRY BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE ONCE MORE THE JUDGES CONSULTED AND ONCE MORE THEY OVERRULED OUR OBJECTION THE CONFESSIONS WERE ADMITTED IN EVIDENCE
4957-36386-0003 IN SUPPORT OF THEIR CASE IT IS NEEDLESS TO WASTE TIME IN RECAPITULATING HIS EVIDENCE HE CONTRADICTED HIMSELF GRAVELY ON CROSS EXAMINATION WE SHOWED PLAINLY AND AFTER INVESTIGATION PROVED THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE BELIEVED ON HIS OATH
4957-36386-0004 THE CHIEF JUSTICE SUMMED UP HE CHARGED IN RELATION TO THE CONFESSIONS THAT NO WEIGHT SHOULD BE ATTACHED TO A CONFESSION INCITED BY HOPE OR FEAR AND HE LEFT IT TO THE JURY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CONFESSIONS IN THIS CASE HAD BEEN SO INFLUENCED
4957-36386-0005 OF HIS DEATH BY PUBLIC EXECUTION LAY IN MAKING A CONFESSION AND THAT THEY WOULD DO THEIR BEST IF HE DID CONFESS TO HAVE HIS SENTENCE COMMUTED TO IMPRISONMENT FOR LIFE AS FOR SILAS HE WAS PROVED TO HAVE BEEN BESIDE HIMSELF WITH TERROR
4957-36386-0006 WOULD INFLUENCE THE VERDICT OF THE JURY ON THE SIDE OF MERCY AFTER AN ABSENCE OF AN HOUR THEY RETURNED INTO COURT WITH A VERDICT OF GUILTY AGAINST BOTH THE PRISONERS BEING ASKED IN DUE FORM IF THEY HAD ANYTHING TO SAY IN MITIGATION OF THEIR SENTENCE
4957-36386-0007 AMBROSE AND SILAS SOLEMNLY DECLARED THEIR INNOCENCE AND PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE CONFESSIONS HAD BEEN WRUNG FROM THEM BY THE HOPE OF ESCAPING THE HANGMAN'S HANDS THIS STATEMENT WAS NOT NOTICED BY THE BENCH THE PRISONERS WERE BOTH SENTENCED TO DEATH
4957-36386-0008 ON MY RETURN TO THE FARM I DID NOT SEE NAOMI MISS MEADOWCROFT INFORMED HER OF THE RESULT OF THE TRIAL HALF AN HOUR LATER ONE OF THE WOMEN SERVANTS HANDED TO ME AN ENVELOPE BEARING MY NAME ON IT IN NAOMI'S HANDWRITING
4957-36386-0009 THE ENVELOPE INCLOSED A LETTER AND WITH IT A SLIP OF PAPER ON WHICH NAOMI HAD HURRIEDLY WRITTEN THESE WORDS FOR GOD'S SAKE READ THE LETTER I SEND TO YOU AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT IMMEDIATELY I LOOKED AT THE LETTER
4957-36386-0010 UPON THIS HE WROTE TO MORWICK FARM TO SAY THAT HE HAD SEEN A MAN EXACTLY ANSWERING TO THE DESCRIPTION OF JOHN JAGO BUT BEARING ANOTHER NAME WORKING AS A CLERK IN A MERCHANT'S OFFICE IN JERSEY CITY HAVING TIME TO SPARE BEFORE THE MAIL WENT OUT
4957-36386-0011 HE HAD RETURNED TO THE OFFICE TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE MAN BEFORE HE POSTED HIS LETTER TO HIS SURPRISE HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE CLERK HAD NOT APPEARED AT HIS DESK THAT DAY HIS EMPLOYER HAD SENT TO HIS LODGINGS
4957-36386-0012 AND HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT HE HAD SUDDENLY PACKED UP HIS HAND BAG AFTER READING THE NEWSPAPER AT BREAKFAST HAD PAID HIS RENT HONESTLY AND HAD GONE AWAY NOBODY KNEW WHERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN I READ THESE LINES
4957-36386-0013 ASSUMING THE LETTER TO BE GENUINE
4957-36386-0014 I REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT THE SEARCH FOR HIM MIGHT BE USEFULLY LIMITED TO NARRABEE AND TO THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD THE NEWSPAPER AT HIS BREAKFAST HAD NO DOUBT GIVEN HIM HIS FIRST INFORMATION OF THE FINDING OF THE GRAND JURY
4957-36386-0015 AND OF THE TRIAL TO FOLLOW IT WAS IN MY EXPERIENCE OF HUMAN NATURE THAT HE SHOULD VENTURE BACK TO NARRABEE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HIS INFATUATION FOR NAOMI MORE THAN THIS
4957-36386-0016 WHICH HIS SUDDEN ABSENCE MIGHT INFLICT ON OTHERS WAS PLAINLY IMPLIED IN HIS SECRET WITHDRAWAL FROM THE FARM THE SAME CRUEL INDIFFERENCE PUSHED TO A FURTHER EXTREME MIGHT WELL LEAD HIM TO PRESS HIS PROPOSALS PRIVATELY ON NAOMI
4957-36386-0017 AND TO FIX HER ACCEPTANCE OF THEM AS THE PRICE TO BE PAID FOR SAVING HER COUSIN'S LIFE TO THESE CONCLUSIONS I ARRIVED AFTER MUCH THINKING I HAD DETERMINED ON NAOMI'S ACCOUNT TO CLEAR THE MATTER UP BUT IT IS ONLY CANDID TO ADD
4957-36386-0018 THAT MY DOUBTS OF JOHN JAGO'S EXISTENCE REMAINED UNSHAKEN BY THE LETTER I BELIEVED IT TO BE NOTHING MORE NOR LESS THAN A HEARTLESS AND STUPID HOAX THE STRIKING OF THE HALL CLOCK ROUSED ME FROM MY MEDITATIONS I COUNTED THE STROKES MIDNIGHT
4957-36386-0019 IT WAS LIKE THE MOONLIGHT ON THE FATAL EVENING WHEN NAOMI HAD MET JOHN JAGO ON THE GARDEN WALK MY BEDROOM CANDLE WAS ON THE SIDE TABLE I HAD JUST LIGHTED IT
4957-36386-0020 I WAS JUST LEAVING THE ROOM WHEN THE DOOR SUDDENLY OPENED AND NAOMI HERSELF STOOD BEFORE ME RECOVERING THE FIRST SHOOK OF HER SUDDEN APPEARANCE I SAW INSTANTLY IN HER EAGER EYES IN HER DEADLY PALE CHEEKS THAT SOMETHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED
4957-36386-0021 A LARGE CLOAK WAS THROWN OVER HER A WHITE HANDKERCHIEF WAS TIED OVER HER HEAD HER HAIR WAS IN DISORDER SHE HAD EVIDENTLY JUST RISEN IN FEAR AND IN HASTE FROM HER BED WHAT IS IT I ASKED ADVANCING TO MEET HER SHE CLUNG TREMBLING WITH AGITATION TO MY ARM
4957-36386-0022 YOU WILL THINK MY OBSTINACY INVINCIBLE I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT EVEN THEN WHERE I ASKED IN THE BACK YARD SHE REPLIED
4957-36386-0023 FOR THE SMALL PROPRIETIES OF EVERY DAY LIFE LET ME SEE HIM I SAID I AM HERE TO FETCH YOU SHE ANSWERED IN HER FRANK AND FEARLESS WAY COME UPSTAIRS WITH ME HER ROOM WAS ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE HOUSE AND WAS THE ONLY BEDROOM WHICH LOOKED OUT ON THE BACK YARD
4957-36386-0024 ON OUR WAY UP THE STAIRS SHE TOLD ME WHAT HAD HAPPENED I WAS IN BED SHE SAID BUT NOT ASLEEP WHEN I HEARD A PEBBLE STRIKE AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE I WAITED WONDERING WHAT IT MEANT ANOTHER PEBBLE WAS THROWN AGAINST THE GLASS SO FAR I WAS SURPRISED BUT NOT FRIGHTENED
4957-36386-0025 I GOT UP AND RAN TO THE WINDOW TO LOOK OUT
4957-36386-0026 LOOKING UP AT ME IN THE MOONLIGHT DID HE SEE YOU YES HE SAID COME DOWN AND SPEAK TO ME I HAVE SOMETHING SERIOUS TO SAY TO YOU DID YOU ANSWER HIM AS SOON AS I COULD CATCH MY BREATH I SAID
4957-36386-0027 WAIT A LITTLE AND RAN DOWNSTAIRS TO YOU WHAT SHALL I DO LET ME SEE HIM AND I WILL TELL YOU WE ENTERED HER ROOM KEEPING CAUTIOUSLY BEHIND THE WINDOW CURTAIN I LOOKED OUT THERE HE WAS HIS BEARD AND MUSTACHE WERE SHAVED OFF HIS HAIR WAS CLOSE CUT
4957-36386-0028 BUT THERE WAS NO DISGUISING HIS WILD BROWN EYES OR THE PECULIAR MOVEMENT OF HIS SPARE WIRY FIGURE AS HE WALKED SLOWLY TO AND FRO IN THE MOONLIGHT WAITING FOR NAOMI
4957-36386-0029 I HAD SO FIRMLY DISBELIEVED THAT JOHN JAGO WAS A LIVING MAN WHAT SHALL I DO NAOMI REPEATED
4957-36386-0030 NO BUT THE DOOR OF THE TOOL HOUSE ROUND THE CORNER IS NOT LOCKED VERY GOOD SHOW YOURSELF AT THE WINDOW AND SAY TO HIM I AM COMING DIRECTLY THE BRAVE GIRL OBEYED ME WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION THERE HAD BEEN NO DOUBT ABOUT HIS EYES AND HIS GAIT
4957-36386-0031 THERE WAS NO DOUBT NOW ABOUT HIS VOICE AS HE ANSWERED SOFTLY FROM BELOW ALL RIGHT
4957-36386-0032 THEN PRETEND TO BE FEARFUL OF DISCOVERY AT THE DAIRY AND BRING HIM ROUND THE CORNER SO THAT I CAN HEAR HIM BEHIND THE DOOR WE LEFT THE HOUSE TOGETHER AND SEPARATED SILENTLY NAOMI FOLLOWED MY INSTRUCTIONS WITH A WOMAN'S QUICK INTELLIGENCE
4957-36386-0033 WHERE STRATAGEMS ARE CONCERNED I HAD HARDLY BEEN A MINUTE IN THE TOOL HOUSE BEFORE I HEARD HIM SPEAKING TO NAOMI ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR THE FIRST WORDS WHICH I CAUGHT DISTINCTLY RELATED TO HIS MOTIVE FOR SECRETLY LEAVING THE FARM MORTIFIED PRIDE
4957-36386-0034 AND THAT IT HAD ACTUALLY ENCOURAGED HIM TO KEEP IN HIDING AFTER BEING LAUGHED AT AND INSULTED AND DENIED I WAS GLAD SAID THE MISERABLE WRETCH TO SEE THAT SOME OF YOU HAD SERIOUS REASON TO WISH ME BACK AGAIN IT RESTS WITH YOU MISS NAOMI TO KEEP ME HERE
4957-36386-0035 AND TO PERSUADE ME TO SAVE AMBROSE BY SHOWING MYSELF AND
4957-36386-0036 HE LOWERED HIS VOICE BUT I COULD STILL HEAR HIM PROMISE YOU WILL MARRY ME HE SAID AND I WILL GO BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE TO MORROW AND SHOW HIM THAT I AM A LIVING MAN SUPPOSE I REFUSE
4957-36386-0037 ASKED THE GIRL RAISING HER VOICE IF YOU ATTEMPT TO GIVE THE ALARM HE ANSWERED AS TRUE AS GOD'S ABOVE US YOU WILL FEEL MY HAND ON YOUR THROAT IT'S MY TURN NOW MISS AND I AM NOT TO BE TRIFLED WITH WILL YOU HAVE ME FOR YOUR HUSBAND YES OR NO
4957-36386-0038 NO SHE ANSWERED LOUDLY AND FIRMLY I BURST OPEN THE DOOR AND SEIZED HIM AS HE LIFTED HIS HAND ON HER
