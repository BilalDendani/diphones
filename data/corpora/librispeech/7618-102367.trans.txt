7618-102367-0000 SOVEREIGNTY THE TERM SOVEREIGN OR SOVEREIGNTY SAYS JUDGE STORY IS USED IN DIFFERENT SENSES WHICH OFTEN LEADS TO A CONFUSION OF IDEAS AND SOMETIMES TO VERY MISCHIEVOUS AND UNFOUNDED CONCLUSIONS
7618-102367-0001 WITHOUT ANY DISRESPECT FOR JUDGE STORY OR ANY DISPARAGEMENT OF HIS GREAT LEARNING AND ABILITY IT MAY SAFELY BE ADDED THAT HE AND HIS DISCIPLES HAVE CONTRIBUTED NOT A LITTLE TO THE INCREASE OF THIS CONFUSION OF IDEAS
7618-102367-0002 AND THE SPREAD OF THESE MISCHIEVOUS AND UNFOUNDED CONCLUSIONS THERE IS NO GOOD REASON WHATEVER WHY IT SHOULD BE USED IN DIFFERENT SENSES OR WHY THERE SHOULD BE ANY CONFUSION OF IDEAS AS TO ITS MEANING OF ALL THE TERMS EMPLOYED IN POLITICAL SCIENCE
7618-102367-0003 IT IS ONE OF THE MOST DEFINITE AND INTELLIGIBLE THE DEFINITION OF IT GIVEN BY THAT ACCURATE AND LUCID PUBLICIST BURLAMAQUI IS SIMPLE AND SATISFACTORY THAT SOVEREIGNTY
7618-102367-0004 BUT HE ADDS WHEN ONCE THE PEOPLE HAVE TRANSFERRED THEIR RIGHT TO A SOVEREIGN
7618-102367-0005 THEY CAN NOT WITHOUT CONTRADICTION
7618-102367-0006 THE PECULIARITY OF WHICH IS THAT THE PEOPLE NEVER DO TRANSFER THEIR RIGHT OF SOVEREIGNTY EITHER IN WHOLE OR IN PART THEY ONLY DELEGATE TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS THE EXERCISE OF SUCH OF ITS FUNCTIONS AS MAY BE NECESSARY
7618-102367-0007 SUBJECT ALWAYS TO THEIR OWN CONTROL AND TO REASSUMPTION WHENEVER SUCH GOVERNMENT FAILS TO FULFILL THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH IT WAS INSTITUTED I THINK IT HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT IN THIS COUNTRY THE ONLY POLITICAL COMMUNITY
7618-102367-0008 THE ONLY INDEPENDENT CORPORATE UNIT THROUGH WHICH THE PEOPLE CAN EXERCISE THEIR SOVEREIGNTY IS THE STATE MINOR COMMUNITIES AS THOSE OF COUNTIES CITIES AND TOWNS ARE MERELY FRACTIONAL SUBDIVISIONS OF THE STATE
7618-102367-0009 AND THESE DO NOT AFFECT THE EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS NOT SUCH A POLITICAL COMMUNITY AS THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE AGGREGATE THAT THE STATES WERE SEVERALLY SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT WHEN THEY WERE UNITED UNDER THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION IS DISTINCTLY ASSERTED IN THOSE ARTICLES
7618-102367-0010 AND IS ADMITTED EVEN BY THE EXTREME PARTISANS OF CONSOLIDATION OF RIGHT THEY ARE STILL SOVEREIGN UNLESS THEY HAVE SURRENDERED OR BEEN DIVESTED OF THEIR SOVEREIGNTY AND THOSE WHO DENY THE PROPOSITION HAVE BEEN VAINLY CALLED UPON
7618-102367-0011 TO POINT OUT THE PROCESS BY WHICH THEY HAVE DIVESTED THEMSELVES OR HAVE BEEN DIVESTED OF IT OTHERWISE THAN BY USURPATION SINCE WEBSTER SPOKE AND STORY WROTE UPON THE SUBJECT HOWEVER THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE STATES HAS BEEN VEHEMENTLY DENIED
7618-102367-0012 OR EXPLAINED AWAY AS ONLY A PARTIAL IMPERFECT MUTILATED SOVEREIGNTY PARADOXICAL THEORIES OF DIVIDED SOVEREIGNTY AND DELEGATED SOVEREIGNTY HAVE ARISEN TO CREATE THAT CONFUSION OF IDEAS
7618-102367-0013 AND ENGENDER THOSE MISCHIEVOUS AND UNFOUNDED CONCLUSIONS OF WHICH JUDGE STORY SPEAKS CONFOUNDING THE SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY OF THE PEOPLE WITH THE DELEGATED POWERS CONFERRED BY THEM UPON THEIR GOVERNMENTS
7618-102367-0014 WE HEAR OF A GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES SOVEREIGN WITHIN ITS SPHERE AND OF STATE GOVERNMENTS SOVEREIGN IN THEIR SPHERE OF THE SURRENDER BY THE STATES OF PART OF THEIR SOVEREIGNTY TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE LIKE NOW IF THERE BE
7618-102367-0015 ANY ONE GREAT PRINCIPLE PERVADING THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION THE STATE CONSTITUTIONS THE WRITINGS OF THE FATHERS THE WHOLE AMERICAN SYSTEM AS CLEARLY AS THE SUNLIGHT PERVADES THE SOLAR SYSTEM IT IS THAT NO GOVERNMENT IS SOVEREIGN
7618-102367-0016 THAT ALL GOVERNMENTS DERIVE THEIR POWERS FROM THE PEOPLE AND EXERCISE THEM IN SUBJECTION TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE NOT A WILL EXPRESSED IN ANY IRREGULAR LAWLESS TUMULTUARY MANNER BUT THE WILL OF THE ORGANIZED POLITICAL COMMUNITY
7618-102367-0017 EXPRESSED THROUGH AUTHORIZED AND LEGITIMATE CHANNELS THE FOUNDERS OF THE AMERICAN REPUBLICS NEVER CONFERRED NOR INTENDED TO CONFER SOVEREIGNTY UPON EITHER THEIR STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS
7618-102367-0018 IF THEN THE PEOPLE OF THE STATES IN FORMING A FEDERAL UNION SURRENDERED OR TO USE BURLAMAQUI'S TERM TRANSFERRED OR IF THEY MEANT TO SURRENDER OR TRANSFER PART OF THEIR SOVEREIGNTY TO WHOM WAS THE TRANSFER MADE
7618-102367-0019 FOR THERE WAS NO SUCH PEOPLE IN EXISTENCE AND THEY DID NOT CREATE OR CONSTITUTE SUCH A PEOPLE BY MERGER OF THEMSELVES NOT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THEY DISCLAIMED AS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE THE SOVEREIGNTY OF ANY GOVERNMENT THERE WAS NO SUCH SURRENDER
7618-102367-0020 NO SUCH TRANSFER IN WHOLE OR IN PART EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED THEY RETAINED AND INTENDED TO RETAIN THEIR SOVEREIGNTY IN ITS INTEGRITY UNDIVIDED AND INDIVISIBLE
7618-102367-0021 BUT INDEED SAYS MISTER MOTLEY THE WORDS SOVEREIGN AND SOVEREIGNTY ARE PURELY INAPPLICABLE TO THE AMERICAN SYSTEM IN THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE THE PROVINCES DECLARE THEMSELVES FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES
7618-102367-0022 BUT THE MEN OF THOSE DAYS KNEW THAT THE WORD SOVEREIGN WAS A TERM OF FEUDAL ORIGIN WHEN THEIR CONNECTION WITH A TIME HONORED FEUDAL MONARCHY WAS ABRUPTLY SEVERED
7618-102367-0023 WE HAVE SEEN THAT IN THE VERY FRONT OF THEIR ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION THEY SET FORTH THE CONSPICUOUS DECLARATION THAT EACH STATE RETAINED ITS SOVEREIGNTY FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE
7618-102367-0024 MASSACHUSETTS THE STATE I BELIEVE OF MISTER MOTLEY'S NATIVITY AND CITIZENSHIP IN HER ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION DRAWN UP BY MEN OF THOSE DAYS MADE THIS DECLARATION THE PEOPLE INHABITING THE TERRITORY FORMERLY CALLED THE PROVINCE OF MASSACHUSETTS BAY
7618-102367-0025 DO HEREBY SOLEMNLY AND MUTUALLY AGREE WITH EACH OTHER TO FORM THEMSELVES INTO A FREE SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT BODY POLITIC OR STATE BY THE NAME OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
7618-102367-0026 NEW HAMPSHIRE IN HER CONSTITUTION AS REVISED IN SEVENTEEN NINETY TWO HAD IDENTICALLY THE SAME DECLARATION EXCEPT AS REGARDS THE NAME OF THE STATE AND THE WORD STATE INSTEAD OF COMMONWEALTH MISTER MADISON
7618-102367-0027 ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED OF THE MEN OF THAT DAY AND OF THE ADVOCATES OF THE CONSTITUTION IN A SPEECH ALREADY ONCE REFERRED TO IN THE VIRGINIA CONVENTION OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT EXPLAINED THAT WE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE TO ESTABLISH THE CONSTITUTION
7618-102367-0028 DO THEY THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE CONFEDERATION REQUIRE THAT IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION THE STATES SHOULD BE REGARDED AS DISTINCT AND INDEPENDENT SOVEREIGNS
7618-102367-0029 ANOTHER CONTEMPORARY AUTHORITY NO LESS ILLUSTRIOUS SAYS IN THE FEDERALIST IT IS INHERENT IN THE NATURE OF SOVEREIGNTY NOT TO BE AMENABLE TO THE SUIT OF AN INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT ITS CONSENT THIS IS THE GENERAL SENSE AND THE GENERAL PRACTICE OF MANKIND
7618-102367-0030 AND THE EXEMPTION AS ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF SOVEREIGNTY
7618-102367-0031 ALWAYS WITH REFERENCE TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY AND SEVERALLY
7618-102367-0032 JAMES WILSON OF PENNSYLVANIA SAID SOVEREIGNTY IS IN THE PEOPLE BEFORE THEY MAKE A CONSTITUTION AND REMAINS IN THEM
7618-102367-0033 ONE OF THE WARMEST ADVOCATES IN THE CONVENTION OF A STRONG CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SPOKE OF THE CONSTITUTION AS A COMPACT
7618-102367-0034 BUT WHY MULTIPLY CITATIONS IT IS VERY EVIDENT THAT THE MEN OF THOSE DAYS ENTERTAINED VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS OF SOVEREIGNTY FROM THOSE SET FORTH BY THE NEW LIGHTS OF OUR DAY FAR FROM CONSIDERING IT A TERM OF FEUDAL ORIGIN PURELY INAPPLICABLE TO THE AMERICAN SYSTEM
7618-102367-0035 THEY SEEM TO HAVE REGARDED IT AS A VERY VITAL PRINCIPLE IN THAT SYSTEM AND OF NECESSITY BELONGING TO THE SEVERAL STATES AND I DO NOT FIND A SINGLE INSTANCE IN WHICH THEY APPLIED IT TO ANY POLITICAL ORGANIZATION EXCEPT THE STATES
7618-102367-0036 THEIR IDEAS WERE IN ENTIRE ACCORD WITH THOSE OF VATTEL WHO IN HIS CHAPTER OF NATIONS OR SOVEREIGN STATES WRITES EVERY NATION THAT GOVERNS ITSELF UNDER WHAT FORM SOEVER WITHOUT ANY DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN POWER
7618-102367-0037 HE SAYS SEVERAL SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT STATES MAY UNITE THEMSELVES TOGETHER BY A PERPETUAL CONFEDERACY WITHOUT EACH IN PARTICULAR CEASING TO BE A PERFECT STATE THEY WILL FORM TOGETHER A FEDERAL REPUBLIC
7618-102367-0038 THE DELIBERATIONS IN COMMON WILL OFFER NO VIOLENCE TO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF EACH MEMBER THOUGH THEY MAY IN CERTAIN RESPECTS
7618-102367-0039 IS EXPLAINED BY A SUBSEQUENT PASSAGE
