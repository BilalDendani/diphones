1920-1793-0000 CHAPTER ONE THE SORCERESS THE PLAGUE RAGED IN THE CITY OF LONDON THE DESTROYING ANGEL HAD GONE FORTH AND KINDLED WITH ITS FIERY BREATH THE AWFUL PESTILENCE
1920-1793-0001 WHOLE STREETS WERE SHUT UP AND ALMOST EVERY OTHER HOUSE IN THE CITY BORE THE FATAL RED CROSS AND THE OMINOUS INSCRIPTION LORD HAVE MERCY ON US FEW PEOPLE SAVE THE WATCHMEN ARMED WITH HALBERTS KEEPING GUARD OVER THE STRICKEN HOUSES APPEARED IN THE STREETS
1920-1793-0002 AND THOSE WHO VENTURED THERE SHRANK FROM EACH OTHER AND PASSED RAPIDLY ON WITH AVERTED FACES MANY EVEN FELL DEAD ON THE SIDEWALK AND LAY WITH THEIR GHASTLY DISCOLORED FACES UPTURNED TO THE MOCKING SUNLIGHT UNTIL THE DEAD CART CAME RATTLING ALONG
1920-1793-0003 AND THE DRIVERS HOISTED THE BODY WITH THEIR PITCHFORKS ON THE TOP OF THEIR DREADFUL LOAD FEW OTHER VEHICLES BESIDES THOSE SAME DEAD CARTS APPEARED IN THE CITY NOW AND THEY PLIED THEIR TRADE BUSILY DAY AND NIGHT
1920-1793-0004 AND THE CRY OF THE DRIVERS ECHOED DISMALLY THROUGH THE DESERTED STREETS BRING OUT YOUR DEAD BRING OUT YOUR DEAD ALL WHO COULD DO SO HAD LONG AGO FLED FROM THE DEVOTED CITY AND LONDON LAY UNDER THE BURNING HEAT OF THE JUNE SUNSHINE
1920-1793-0005 STRICKEN FOR ITS SINS BY THE HAND OF GOD THE PEST HOUSES WERE FULL SO WERE THE PLAGUE PITS WHERE THE DEAD WERE HURLED IN CARTFULS AND NO ONE KNEW WHO ROSE UP IN HEALTH IN THE MORNING BUT THAT THEY MIGHT BE LYING STARK AND DEAD IN A FEW HOURS
1920-1793-0006 THEIR PASTORS FLED OR LYING IN THE PLAGUE PITS AND IT WAS EVEN RESOLVED TO CONVERT THE GREAT CATHEDRAL OF SAINT PAUL INTO A VAST PLAGUE HOSPITAL CRIES AND LAMENTATIONS ECHOED FROM ONE END OF THE CITY TO THE OTHER AND DEATH AND CHARLES
1920-1793-0007 REIGNED OVER LONDON TOGETHER YET IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS MANY SCENES OF WILD ORGIES AND DEBAUCHERY STILL WENT ON WITHIN ITS GATES AS IN OUR OWN DAY WHEN THE CHOLERA RAVAGED PARIS THE INHABITANTS OF THAT FACETIOUS CITY MADE IT A CARNIVAL
1920-1793-0008 SO NOW IN LONDON THEY WERE MANY WHO FEELING THEY HAD BUT A FEW DAYS TO LIVE AT THE MOST RESOLVED TO DEFY DEATH AND INDULGE IN THE REVELRY WHILE THEY YET EXISTED
1920-1793-0009 AND IF IN THE MIDST OF THE FRANTIC DANCE OR DEBAUCHED REVEL ONE OF THEM DROPPED DEAD THE OTHERS ONLY SHRIEKED WITH LAUGHTER HURLED THE LIVID BODY OUT TO THE STREET AND THE DEMONIAC MIRTH GREW TWICE AS FAST AND FURIOUS AS BEFORE
1920-1793-0010 ENTERED BOLDLY CLOSED AND DESERTED HOUSES AND BORE OFF WITH IMPUNITY WHATEVER THEY PLEASED HIGHWAYMEN INFESTED HOUNSLOW HEATH AND ALL THE ROADS LEADING FROM THE CITY LEVYING A TOLL ON ALL WHO PASSED AND PLUNDERING FEARLESSLY THE FLYING CITIZENS
1920-1793-0011 IN FACT FAR FAMED LONDON TOWN IN THE YEAR OF GRACE SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE
1920-1793-0012 IT WAS DRAWING TO THE CLOSE OF AN ALMOST TROPICAL JUNE DAY THAT THE CROWD WHO HAD THRONGED THE PRECINCTS OF SAINT PAUL'S SINCE EARLY MORNING BEGAN TO DISPERSE
1920-1793-0013 WAS SINKING FROM SIGHT IN CLOUDS OF CRIMSON PURPLE AND GOLD YET PAUL'S WALK WAS CROWDED THERE WERE COURT GALLANTS IN RUFFLES AND PLUMES BALLAD SINGERS CHANTING THE NOT OVER DELICATE DITTIES OF THE EARL OF ROCHESTER
1920-1793-0014 USURERS EXCHANGING GOLD FOR BONDS WORTH THREE TIMES WHAT THEY GAVE FOR THEM QUACK DOCTORS READING IN DOLOROUS TONES THE BILLS OF MORTALITY OF THE PRECEDING DAY AND SELLING PLAGUE WATERS AND ANTI PESTILENTIAL ABOMINATIONS WHOSE MERIT THEY LOUDLY EXTOLLED
1920-1793-0015 LADIES TOO RICHLY DRESSED AND MANY OF THEM MASKED
1920-1793-0016 AND EVEN TO THIS DAY PATRONIZE ITS PRECINCTS AND FLOURISH IN THE REGIONS OF PATERNOSTER ROW AND AVE MARIA LANE COURT PAGES IN RICH LIVERIES PERT AND FLIPPANT SERVING MEN OUT OF PLACE
1920-1793-0017 AND PICKPOCKETS WITH A KEEN EYE TO BUSINESS ALL CLASHED AND JOSTLED TOGETHER
1920-1793-0018 AND JAUNTY HAT SET SLIGHTLY ON ONE SIDE OF HIS HEAD WITH ITS LONG BLACK PLUME AND DIAMOND CLASP PROCLAIMED HIM TO BE SOMEBODY A PROFUSION OF SNOWY SHIRT FRILL RUSHED IMPETUOUSLY OUT OF HIS DOUBLET A BLACK VELVET CLOAK
1920-1793-0019 LINED WITH AMBER SATIN FELL PICTURESQUELY FROM HIS SHOULDERS A SWORD WITH A JEWELED HILT CLANKED ON THE PAVEMENT AS HE WALKED ONE HAND WAS COVERED WITH A GAUNTLET OF CANARY COLORED KID PERFUMED TO A DEGREE THAT WOULD SHAME ANY BELLE OF TO DAY
1920-1793-0020 THE OTHER WHICH RESTED LIGHTLY ON HIS SWORD HILT FLASHED WITH A SPLENDID OPAL SPLENDIDLY SET HE WAS A HANDSOME FELLOW TOO WITH FAIR WAVING HAIR FOR HE HAD THE GOOD TASTE TO DISCARD THE UGLY WIGS THEN IN VOGUE
1920-1793-0021 DARK BRIGHT HANDSOME EYES A THICK BLONDE MOUSTACHE A TALL AND REMARKABLY GRACEFUL FIGURE AND AN EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE WHEREIN EASY GOOD NATURE AND FIERY IMPETUOSITY HAD A HARD STRUGGLE FOR MASTERY
1920-1793-0022 THAT HE WAS A COURTIER OF RANK WAS APPARENT FROM HIS RICH ATTIRE AND RATHER ARISTOCRATIC BEARING AND A CROWD OF HANGERS ON FOLLOWED HIM AS HE WENT LOUDLY DEMANDING SPUR MONEY A GROUP OF TIMBRIL GIRLS SINGING SHRILLY THE SONGS OF THE DAY
1920-1793-0023 CALLED BOLDLY TO HIM AS HE PASSED AND ONE OF THEM MORE FREE AND EASY THAN THE REST DANCED UP TO HIM STRIKING HER TIMBREL AND SHOUTING RATHER THAN SINGING THE CHORUS OF THE THEN POPULAR DITTY WHAT CARE I FOR PEST OR PLAGUE
1920-1793-0024 WE CAN DIE BUT ONCE GOD WOT KISS ME DARLING STAY WITH ME LOVE ME LOVE ME LEAVE ME NOT THE DARLING IN QUESTION TURNED HIS BRIGHT BLUE EYES ON THAT DASHING STREET SINGER WITH A COOL GLANCE OF RECOGNITION
1920-1793-0025 VERY SORRY NELL HE SAID IN A NONCHALANT TONE BUT I'M AFRAID I MUST
1920-1793-0026 A FULL HOUR BY SAINT PAUL'S AND WHERE HAS SIR NORMAN KINGSLEY BEEN MAY I ASK I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD OF THE PLAGUE NOT EXACTLY HAVE YOU SEEN AH THERE HE IS THE VERY MAN I WANT
1920-1793-0027 AND TAKING NO NOTICE OF THE BUSY SCENE AROUND HIM UNTIL SIR NORMAN LAID HIS UNGLOVED AND JEWELED HAND LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDER GOOD MORNING ORMISTON I HAD AN IDEA I WOULD FIND YOU HERE AND BUT WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU MAN HAVE YOU GOT THE PLAGUE
1920-1793-0028 AND WAS ABOUT TO QUIT THIS CONFOUNDED BABEL THIS TUMULTUOUS DEN OF THIEVES WHAT HAS DETAINED YOU I WAS ON DUTY AT WHITEHALL ARE WE NOT IN TIME TO KEEP OUR APPOINTMENT OH CERTAINLY
1920-1793-0029 NOTHING ELSE COULD EVER HAVE MADE YOU LOOK SO DISMALLY WOEBEGONE AS YOU DID WHEN PROVIDENCE SENT ME TO YOUR RELIEF I WAS THINKING OF HER SAID THE YOUNG MAN MOODILY AND WITH A DARKENING BROW
1920-1793-0030 SIR NORMAN FAVORED HIM WITH A HALF AMUSED HALF CONTEMPTUOUS STARE FOR A MOMENT THEN STOPPED AT A HUCKSTER'S STALL TO PURCHASE SOME CIGARETTES LIT ONE AND AFTER SMOKING FOR A FEW MINUTES PLEASANTLY REMARKED AS IF THE FACT HAD JUST STRUCK HIM ORMISTON
1920-1793-0031 YOU'RE A FOOL I KNOW IT SAID ORMISTON SENTENTIOUSLY THE IDEA SAID SIR NORMAN KNOCKING THE ASHES DAINTILY OFF THE END OF HIS CIGAR WITH THE TIP OF HIS LITTLE FINGER THE IDEA OF FALLING IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN WHOSE FACE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN
1920-1793-0032 AND OUT THROUGH THE GREAT DOOR OF THE CATHEDRAL FOLLOWED BY HIS MELANCHOLY FRIEND PAUSING FOR A MOMENT TO GAZE AT THE GORGEOUS SUNSET WITH A LOOK OF LANGUID ADMIRATION SIR NORMAN PASSED HIS ARM THROUGH THAT OF HIS FRIEND
1920-1793-0033 IN THE DIRECTION OF OLD LONDON BRIDGE THERE WERE FEW PEOPLE ABROAD EXCEPT THE WATCHMEN WALKING SLOWLY UP AND DOWN BEFORE THE PLAGUE STRICKEN HOUSES BUT IN EVERY STREET THEY PASSED THROUGH THEY NOTICED HUGE PILES OF WOOD AND COAL HEAPED DOWN THE CENTRE
1920-1793-0034 SMOKING ZEALOUSLY THEY HAD WALKED ON FOR A SEASON IN SILENCE WHEN ORMISTON CEASED PUFFING FOR A MOMENT TO INQUIRE WHAT ARE ALL THESE FOR THIS IS A STRANGE TIME I SHOULD IMAGINE FOR BONFIRES
1920-1793-0035 THEY'RE NOT BONFIRES SAID SIR NORMAN
1920-1793-0036 SO WHEN SAINT PAUL'S TOLLS THE HOUR OF MIDNIGHT ALL THESE PILES ARE TO BE FIRED IT WILL BE A GLORIOUS ILLUMINATION NO DOUBT BUT AS TO ITS STOPPING THE PROGRESS OF THE PLAGUE I AM AFRAID THAT IT IS ALTOGETHER TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
1920-1793-0037 WHY SHOULD YOU DOUBT IT THE PLAGUE CANNOT LAST FOREVER NO BUT LILLY THE ASTROLOGER WHO PREDICTED ITS COMING ALSO FORETOLD THAT IT WOULD LAST FOR MANY MONTHS YET AND SINCE ONE PROPHECY HAS COME TRUE
1920-1793-0038 I SEE NO REASON WHY THE OTHER SHOULD NOT EXCEPT THE SIMPLE ONE THAT THERE WOULD BE NOBODY LEFT ALIVE TO TAKE IT ALL LONDON WILL BE LYING IN THE PLAGUE PITS BY THAT TIME A PLEASANT PROSPECT BUT A TRUE ONE I HAVE NO DOUBT
1920-1793-0039 AND AS I HAVE NO AMBITION TO BE HURLED HEADLONG INTO ONE OF THOSE HORRIBLE HOLES I SHALL LEAVE TOWN ALTOGETHER IN A FEW DAYS AND ORMISTON I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU TO FOLLOW MY EXAMPLE
1920-1793-0040 SO BE IT I DON'T FEAR THE PLAGUE HALF AS MUCH AS I DO THE THOUGHT OF LOSING HER AGAIN SIR NORMAN STARED OH I SEE IT'S A HOPELESS CASE
1920-1793-0041 FAITH I BEGIN TO FEEL CURIOUS TO SEE THIS ENCHANTRESS WHO HAS MANAGED SO EFFECTUALLY TO TURN YOUR BRAIN WHEN DID YOU SEE HER LAST YESTERDAY SAID ORMISTON WITH A DEEP SIGH
1920-1793-0042 AND IF SHE WERE MADE OF GRANITE SHE COULD NOT BE HARDER TO ME THAN SHE IS SO SHE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOU THEN NOT SHE SHE HAS A LITTLE BLENHEIM LAPDOG THAT SHE LOVES A THOUSAND TIMES MORE THAN SHE EVER WILL ME
1920-1793-0043 THEN WHAT AN IDIOT YOU ARE TO KEEP HAUNTING HER LIKE HER SHADOW WHY DON'T YOU BE A MAN AND TEAR OUT FROM YOUR HEART SUCH A GODDESS AH THAT'S EASILY SAID BUT IF YOU WERE IN MY PLACE YOU'D ACT EXACTLY AS I DO
1920-1793-0044 I DON'T BELIEVE IT IT'S NOT IN ME TO GO MAD ABOUT ANYTHING WITH A MASKED FACE AND A MARBLE HEART IF I LOVED ANY WOMAN WHICH THANK FORTUNE AT THIS PRESENT TIME I DO NOT AND SHE HAD THE BAD TASTE NOT TO RETURN IT
1920-1793-0045 I SHOULD TAKE MY HAT MAKE HER A BOW AND GO DIRECTLY AND LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE MADE OF FLESH AND BLOOD INSTEAD OF CAST IRON YOU KNOW THE OLD SONG ORMISTON IF SHE BE NOT FAIR FOR ME WHAT CARE I HOW FAIR SHE BE
1920-1793-0046 AND FLUNG HIS SMOKED OUT WEED INTO A HEAP OF FIRE WOOD ARE WE NEAR HER HOUSE HE ASKED YONDER IS THE BRIDGE AND YONDER IS THE HOUSE REPLIED ORMISTON POINTING TO A LARGE ANCIENT BUILDING ANCIENT EVEN FOR THOSE TIMES
1920-1793-0047 WITH THREE STORIES EACH PROJECTING OVER THE OTHER SEE WHILE THE HOUSES ON EITHER SIDE ARE MARKED AS PEST STRICKEN HERS ALONE BEARS NO CROSS SO IT IS THOSE WHO CLING TO LIFE ARE STRICKEN WITH DEATH
1920-1793-0048 AND THOSE WHO LIKE ME ARE DESPERATE EVEN DEATH SHUNS WHY MY DEAR ORMISTON YOU SURELY ARE NOT SO FAR GONE AS THAT UPON MY HONOR I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE IN SUCH A BAD WAY
1920-1793-0049 I AM NOTHING BUT A MISERABLE WRETCH AND I WISH TO HEAVEN I WAS IN YONDER DEAD CART WITH THE REST OF THEM AND SHE TOO IF SHE NEVER INTENDS TO LOVE ME ORMISTON SPOKE WITH SUCH FIERCE EARNESTNESS THAT THERE WAS NO DOUBTING HIS SINCERITY
1920-1793-0050 AND SIR NORMAN BECAME PROFOUNDLY SHOCKED SO MUCH SO THAT HE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN UNTIL THEY WERE ALMOST AT THE DOOR THEN HE OPENED HIS LIPS TO ASK IN A SUBDUED TONE SHE HAS PREDICTED THE FUTURE FOR YOU WHAT DID SHE FORETELL
1920-1793-0051 NOTHING GOOD NO FEAR OF THERE BEING ANYTHING IN STORE FOR SUCH AN UNLUCKY DOG AS I AM WHERE DID SHE LEARN THIS WONDERFUL BLACK ART OF HERS
1920-1793-0052 AND NOW VISITS ENGLAND FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE HAS CHOSEN A SPRIGHTLY SEASON FOR HER VISIT IS SHE NOT AFRAID OF THE PLAGUE I WONDER NO SHE FEARS NOTHING SAID ORMISTON AS HE KNOCKED LOUDLY AT THE DOOR
1920-1793-0053 I BEGIN TO BELIEVE SHE IS MADE OF ADAMANT INSTEAD OF WHAT OTHER WOMEN ARE MADE OF WHICH IS A RIB I BELIEVE OBSERVED SIR NORMAN THOUGHTFULLY AND THAT ACCOUNTS I DARE SAY FOR THEIR BEING OF SUCH A CROOKED AND CANTANKEROUS NATURE
1920-1793-0054 THEY'RE A WONDERFUL RACE WOMEN ARE AND FOR WHAT INSCRUTABLE REASON IT HAS PLEASED PROVIDENCE TO CREATE THEM THE OPENING OF THE DOOR BROUGHT TO A SUDDEN END THIS LITTLE TOUCH OF MORALIZING AND A WRINKLED OLD PORTER THRUST OUT A VERY WITHERED AND UNLOVELY FACE
1920-1793-0055 LA MASQUE AT HOME INQUIRED ORMISTON STEPPING IN WITHOUT CEREMONY THE OLD MAN NODDED AND POINTED UP STAIRS AND WITH A THIS WAY KINGSLEY ORMISTON SPRANG LIGHTLY UP THREE AT A TIME FOLLOWED IN THE SAME STYLE BY SIR NORMAN
1920-1793-0056 ON WHICH LAY A PAIR OF THE OLD MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS CALLED VIRGINALS TWO LARGE CURTAINLESS WINDOWS WITH MINUTE DIAMOND SHAPED PANES SET IN LEADEN CASEMENTS ADMITTED THE GOLDEN AND CRIMSON LIGHT
1920-1793-0057 FOR THE RECEPTION ROOM OF A SORCERESS REMARKED SIR NORMAN WITH AN AIR OF DISAPPOINTED CRITICISM THERE IS NOTHING VERY WONDERFUL ABOUT ALL THIS HOW IS IT SHE SPAES FORTUNES ANY WAY AS LILLY DOES BY MAPS AND CHARTS
1920-1793-0058 NEITHER SAID ORMISTON
1920-1793-0059 WHO SHOW YOU YOUR DESTINY IN A WELL SHE HAS A SORT OF MAGIC LAKE IN HER ROOM AND BUT YOU WILL SEE IT ALL FOR YOURSELF PRESENTLY I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD SAID SIR NORMAN IN THE SAME MEDITATIVE WAY THAT TRUTH LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL
1920-1793-0060 HE FLUNG OPEN A PAIR OF SHINING FOLDING DOORS AT THE END AND USHERED THEM AT ONCE INTO THE MAJESTIC PRESENCE OF THE SORCERESS AND HER MAGIC ROOM BOTH GENTLEMEN DOFFED THEIR PLUMED HATS ORMISTON STEPPED FORWARD AT ONCE BUT SIR NORMAN DISCREETLY PAUSED IN THE DOORWAY
1920-1793-0061 TO CONTEMPLATE THE SCENE OF ACTION AS HE SLOWLY DID SO A LOOK OF DEEP DISPLEASURE SETTLED ON HIS FEATURES ON FINDING IT NOT HALF SO AWFUL AS HE HAD SUPPOSED IN SOME WAYS IT WAS VERY LIKE THE ROOM THEY HAD LEFT BEING LOW LARGE AND SQUARE
1920-1793-0062 BUT IT HAD NO WINDOWS A LARGE BRONZE LAMP SUSPENDED FROM THE CENTRE OF THE CEILING SHED A FLICKERING GHOSTLY LIGHT THERE WERE NO PAINTINGS SOME GRIM CARVINGS OF SKULLS SKELETONS AND SERPENTS PLEASANTLY WREATHED THE ROOM
1920-1793-0063 NEITHER WERE THERE SEATS NOR TABLES NOTHING BUT A HUGE EBONY CALDRON AT THE UPPER END OF THE APARTMENT OVER WHICH A GRINNING SKELETON ON WIRES WITH A SCYTHE IN ONE HAND OF BONE AND AN HOUR GLASS IN THE OTHER KEPT WATCH AND WARD
1920-1793-0064 OPPOSITE THIS CHEERFUL LOOKING GUARDIAN WAS A TALL FIGURE IN BLACK
1920-1793-0065 IT WAS A FEMALE FIGURE VERY TALL AND SLIGHT BUT AS BEAUTIFULLY SYMMETRICAL AS A VENUS CELESTIS HER DRESS WAS OF BLACK VELVET THAT SWEPT THE POLISHED FLOOR SPANGLED ALL OVER WITH STARS OF GOLD AND RICH RUBIES
1920-1793-0066 A PROFUSION OF SHINING BLACK HAIR FELL IN WAVES AND CURLS ALMOST TO HER FEET BUT HER FACE FROM FOREHEAD TO CHIN WAS COMPLETELY HIDDEN BY A BLACK VELVET MASK IN ONE HAND EXQUISITELY SMALL AND WHITE
1920-1793-0067 SHE HELD A GOLD CASKET BLAZING LIKE HER DRESS WITH RUBIES AND WITH THE OTHER SHE TOYED WITH A TAME VIPER THAT HAD TWINED ITSELF ROUND HER WRIST THIS WAS DOUBTLESS LA MASQUE AND BECOMING CONSCIOUS OF THAT FACT SIR NORMAN MADE HER A LOW AND COURTLY BOW
1920-1793-0068 WAS THE SWEETEST HE HAD EVER HEARD MUSICAL AS A CHIME OF SILVER BELLS SOFT AS THE TONES OF AN AEOLIAN HARP THROUGH WHICH THE WEST WIND PLAYS MADAM I AM AWARE MY VISITS ARE UNDESIRED SAID ORMISTON WITH A FLUSHING CHEEK AND SLIGHTLY TREMULOUS VOICE
1920-1793-0069 AND I HAVE COME TO SEE WHAT DAME DESTINY IS GOING TO DO FOR ME SIR NORMAN KINGSLEY IS WELCOME SAID THE SWEET VOICE AND SHALL SEE WHAT HE DESIRES THERE IS BUT ONE CONDITION THAT HE WILL KEEP PERFECTLY SILENT FOR IF HE SPEAKS
1920-1793-0070 THE SCENE HE BEHOLDS WILL VANISH COME FORWARD SIR NORMAN COMPRESSED HIS LIPS AS CLOSELY AS IF THEY WERE FOREVER HERMETICALLY SEALED AND CAME FORWARD ACCORDINGLY LEANING OVER THE EDGE OF THE EBONY CALDRON
1920-1793-0071 HE FOUND THAT IT CONTAINED NOTHING MORE DREADFUL THAN WATER FOR HE LABORED UNDER A VAGUE AND UNPLEASANT IDEA THAT LIKE THE WITCHES CALDRON IN MACBETH IT MIGHT BE FILLED WITH SERPENTS BLOOD AND CHILDRENS BRAINS
1920-1793-0072 LA MASQUE OPENED HER GOLDEN CASKET AND TOOK FROM IT A PORTION OF RED POWDER WITH WHICH IT WAS FILLED CASTING IT INTO THE CALDRON SHE MURMURED AN INVOCATION IN SANSCRIT OR COPTIC OR SOME OTHER UNKNOWN TONGUE
1920-1793-0073 AND SLOWLY THERE AROSE A DENSE CLOUD OF DARK RED SMOKE THAT NEARLY FILLED THE ROOM HAD SIR NORMAN EVER READ THE STORY OF ALADDIN HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE THOUGHT OF IT THEN BUT THE YOUNG COURTIER DID NOT GREATLY AFFECT LITERATURE OF ANY KIND
1920-1793-0074 AND THOUGHT OF NOTHING NOW BUT OF SEEING SOMETHING WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARED AWAY IT WAS RATHER LONG IN DOING SO AND WHEN IT DID HE SAW NOTHING AT FIRST BUT HIS OWN HANDSOME HALF SERIOUS HALF INCREDULOUS FACE BUT GRADUALLY A PICTURE
1920-1793-0075 DISTINCT AND CLEAR FORMED ITSELF AT THE BOTTOM AND SIR NORMAN GAZED WITH BEWILDERED EYES HE SAW A LARGE ROOM FILLED WITH A SPARKLING CROWD MANY OF THEM LADIES SPLENDIDLY ARRAYED AND FLASHING IN JEWELS
1920-1793-0076 AND FOREMOST AMONG THEM STOOD ONE WHOSE BEAUTY SURPASSED ANYTHING HE HAD EVER BEFORE DREAMED OF SHE WORE THE ROBES OF A QUEEN
1920-1793-0077 DIAMONDS BLAZED ON THE BEAUTIFUL NECK ARMS AND FINGERS AND A TIARA OF THE SAME BRILLIANTS CROWNED HER REGAL HEAD IN ONE HAND SHE HELD A SCEPTRE WHAT SEEMED TO BE A THRONE WAS BEHIND HER
1920-1793-0078 BUT SOMETHING THAT SURPRISED SIR NORTON MOST OF ALL WAS TO FIND HIMSELF STANDING BESIDE HER
1920-1793-0079 WHILE HE YET GAZED IN MINGLED ASTONISHMENT AND INCREDULITY THE SCENE FADED AWAY AND ANOTHER TOOK ITS PLACE THIS TIME A DUNGEON CELL DAMP AND DISMAL WALLS AND FLOOR AND CEILING COVERED WITH GREEN AND HIDEOUS SLIME
1920-1793-0080 A SMALL LAMP STOOD ON THE FLOOR AND BY ITS SICKLY WATERY GLEAM HE SAW HIMSELF AGAIN STANDING PALE AND DEJECTED NEAR THE WALL BUT HE WAS NOT ALONE THE SAME GLITTERING VISION IN PURPLE AND DIAMONDS STOOD BEFORE HIM
1920-1793-0081 AND SUDDENLY HE DREW HIS SWORD AND PLUNGED IT UP TO THE HILT IN HER HEART THE BEAUTIFUL VISION FELL LIKE A STONE AT HIS FEET AND THE SWORD WAS DRAWN OUT REEKING WITH HER LIFE BLOOD THIS WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR THE REAL SIR NORMAN
1920-1793-0082 AND WITH AN EXPRESSION OF INDIGNANT CONSTERNATION HE SPRANG UPRIGHT INSTANTLY IT ALL FADED AWAY AND THE REFLECTION OF HIS OWN EXCITED FACE LOOKED UP AT HIM FROM THE CALDRON I TOLD YOU NOT TO SPEAK SAID LA MASQUE QUIETLY BUT YOU MUST LOOK ON STILL ANOTHER SCENE
1920-1793-0083 AGAIN SHE THREW A PORTION OF THE CONTENTS OF THE CASKET INTO THE CALDRON AND SPAKE ALOUD THE WORDS OF POWER ANOTHER CLOUD OF SMOKE AROSE AND FILLED THE ROOM AND WHEN IT CLEARED AWAY SIR NORMAN BEHELD A THIRD AND LESS STARTLING SIGHT
1920-1793-0084 ASKED THE LADY I DO SAID SIR NORMAN PROMPTLY IT WAS ORMISTON AND MYSELF RIGHT AND ONE OF THEM WAS DEAD DEAD EXCLAIMED SIR NORMAN WITH A PERCEPTIBLE START WHICH ONE MADAM
1920-1793-0085 IF YOU CANNOT TELL THAT NEITHER CAN I IF THERE IS ANYTHING FURTHER YOU WISH TO SEE I AM QUITE WILLING TO SHOW IT TO YOU I'M OBLIGED TO YOU SAID SIR NORMAN STEPPING BACK BUT NO MORE AT PRESENT THANK YOU
1920-1793-0086 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY MADAM THAT I'M SOME DAY TO MURDER A LADY ESPECIALLY ONE SO BEAUTIFUL AS SHE I JUST NOW SAW I HAVE SAID NOTHING ALL YOU'VE SEEN WILL COME TO PASS
1920-1793-0087 AND WHETHER YOUR DESTINY BE FOR GOOD OR EVIL I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT EXCEPT SAID THE SWEET VOICE EARNESTLY THAT IF LA MASQUE COULD STREW SIR NORMAN KINGSLEY'S PATHWAY WITH ROSES SHE WOULD MOST ASSUREDLY DO SO
1920-1793-0088 MADAM YOU ARE TOO KIND SAID THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN LAYING HIS HAND ON HIS HEART WHILE ORMISTON SCOWLED DARKLY MORE ESPECIALLY AS I'VE THE MISFORTUNE TO BE A PERFECT STRANGER TO YOU NOT SO SIR NORMAN I HAVE KNOWN YOU THIS MANY A DAY
1920-1793-0089 AND BEFORE LONG WE SHALL BE BETTER ACQUAINTED PERMIT ME TO WISH YOU GOOD EVENING AT THIS GENTLE HINT BOTH GENTLEMEN BOWED THEMSELVES OUT AND SOON FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE STREET WITH VERY DIFFERENT EXPRESSIONS OF COUNTENANCE
