2823-160949-0000 THE HUSBAND WHO WAS TO MIND THE HOUSE BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT ONCE ON A TIME THERE WAS A MAN SO SURLY AND CROSS HE NEVER THOUGHT HIS WIFE DID ANYTHING RIGHT IN THE HOUSE SO ONE EVENING
2823-160949-0001 IN HAYMAKING TIME HE CAME HOME SCOLDING AND SWEARING AND SHOWING HIS TEETH AND MAKING A DUST DEAR LOVE DON'T BE SO ANGRY THERE'S A GOOD MAN SAID HIS GOODY TO MORROW LET'S CHANGE OUR WORK I'LL GO OUT WITH THE MOWERS
2823-160949-0002 AND MOW AND YOU SHALL MIND THE HOUSE AT HOME YES THE HUSBAND THOUGHT THAT WOULD DO VERY WELL HE WAS QUITE WILLING HE SAID
2823-160949-0003 AND WENT OUT INTO THE HAYFIELD WITH THE MOWERS AND BEGAN TO MOW BUT THE MAN WAS TO MIND THE HOUSE AND DO THE WORK AT HOME FIRST OF ALL HE WANTED TO CHURN THE BUTTER BUT WHEN HE HAD CHURNED A WHILE HE GOT
2823-160949-0004 THIRSTY AND WENT DOWN TO THE CELLAR TO TAP A BARREL OF ALE SO JUST WHEN HE HAD KNOCKED IN THE BUNG AND WAS PUTTING THE TAP INTO THE CASK HE HEARD OVERHEAD THE PIG COME INTO THE KITCHEN
2823-160949-0005 THEN OFF HE RAN UP THE CELLAR STEPS WITH THE TAP IN HIS HAND AS FAST AS HE COULD TO LOOK AFTER THE PIG LEST IT SHOULD UPSET THE CHURN BUT WHEN HE GOT UP AND SAW THE PIG HAD ALREADY KNOCKED THE CHURN OVER
2823-160949-0006 AND STOOD THERE ROUTING AND GRUNTING AMONGST THE CREAM WHICH WAS RUNNING ALL OVER THE FLOOR HE GOT SO WILD WITH RAGE THAT HE QUITE FORGOT THE ALE BARREL AND RAN AT THE PIG AS HARD AS HE COULD
2823-160949-0007 HE CAUGHT IT TOO JUST AS IT RAN OUT OF DOORS AND GAVE IT SUCH A KICK
2823-160949-0008 ON THE SPOT THEN ALL AT ONCE HE REMEMBERED HE HAD THE TAP IN HIS HAND BUT WHEN HE GOT DOWN TO THE CELLAR EVERY DROP OF ALE HAD RUN OUT OF THE CASK THEN HE WENT INTO THE DAIRY AND FOUND ENOUGH CREAM LEFT TO FILL THE CHURN AGAIN
2823-160949-0009 AND SO HE BEGAN TO CHURN FOR BUTTER THEY MUST HAVE AT DINNER WHEN HE HAD CHURNED A BIT HE REMEMBERED THAT THEIR MILKING COW WAS STILL SHUT UP IN THE STABLE AND HADN'T
2823-160949-0010 THOUGH THE SUN WAS HIGH THEN ALL AT ONCE HE THOUGHT TWAS TOO FAR TO TAKE HER DOWN TO THE MEADOW SO HE'D JUST GET HER UP ON THE HOUSETOP FOR THE HOUSE YOU MUST KNOW WAS THATCHED WITH SODS
2823-160949-0011 AND A FINE CROP OF GRASS WAS GROWING THERE NOW THEIR HOUSE LAY CLOSE UP AGAINST A STEEP DOWN AND HE THOUGHT IF HE LAID A PLANK ACROSS TO THE THATCH AT THE BACK HE'D EASILY GET THE COW UP
2823-160949-0012 BUT STILL HE COULDN'T LEAVE THE CHURN FOR THERE WAS HIS LITTLE BABE CRAWLING ABOUT ON THE FLOOR AND IF I LEAVE IT HE THOUGHT THE CHILD IS SURE TO UPSET IT SO HE TOOK THE CHURN ON HIS BACK
2823-160949-0013 AND WENT OUT WITH IT BUT THEN HE THOUGHT HE'D BETTER FIRST WATER THE COW BEFORE HE TURNED HER OUT ON THE THATCH SO HE TOOK UP A BUCKET TO DRAW WATER OUT OF THE WELL
2823-160949-0014 NOW IT WAS NEAR DINNER TIME AND HE HADN'T EVEN GOT THE BUTTER YET SO HE THOUGHT HE'D BEST BOIL THE PORRIDGE AND FILLED THE POT WITH WATER AND HUNG IT OVER THE FIRE WHEN HE HAD DONE THAT
2823-160949-0015 HE THOUGHT THE COW MIGHT PERHAPS FALL OFF THE THATCH AND BREAK HER LEGS OR HER NECK SO HE GOT UP ON THE HOUSE TO TIE HER UP ONE END OF THE ROPE HE MADE FAST TO THE COW'S NECK
2823-160949-0016 AND THE OTHER HE SLIPPED DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND TIED ROUND HIS OWN THIGH AND HE HAD TO MAKE
2823-160949-0017 AND HE HAD STILL TO GRIND THE OATMEAL SO HE BEGAN TO GRIND AWAY BUT WHILE HE WAS HARD AT IT DOWN FELL THE COW OFF THE HOUSETOP
2823-160949-0018 BY THE ROPE THERE HE STUCK FAST AND AS FOR THE COW SHE HUNG HALF WAY DOWN THE WALL SWINGING BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH FOR SHE COULD NEITHER GET DOWN NOR UP AND NOW THE GOODY
2823-160949-0019 HAD WAITED SEVEN LENGTHS AND SEVEN BREADTHS FOR HER HUSBAND TO COME AND CALL THEM HOME TO DINNER BUT NEVER A CALL THEY HAD AT LAST SHE THOUGHT SHE'D WAITED LONG ENOUGH AND WENT HOME
