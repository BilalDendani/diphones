85-121551-0001 WHO FROM ABOVE DESCENDS BECAUSE IN DRAWING NEAR TO ITS DESIRE OUR INTELLECT INGULPHS ITSELF SO FAR THAT AFTER IT THE MEMORY CANNOT GO TRULY
85-121551-0002 WHATEVER OF THE HOLY REALM I HAD THE POWER TO TREASURE IN MY MIND SHALL NOW BECOME THE SUBJECT OF MY SONG O GOOD APOLLO FOR THIS LAST EMPRISE MAKE OF ME SUCH A VESSEL OF THY POWER
85-121551-0003 AS GIVING THE BELOVED LAUREL ASKS ONE SUMMIT OF PARNASSUS HITHERTO HAS BEEN ENOUGH FOR ME BUT NOW WITH BOTH I NEEDS MUST ENTER THE ARENA LEFT ENTER INTO MY BOSOM THOU

85-121551-0006 FOR TRIUMPH OR OF CAESAR OR OF POET THE FAULT AND SHAME OF HUMAN INCLINATIONS THAT THE PENEIAN FOLIAGE SHOULD BRING FORTH JOY TO THE JOYOUS DELPHIC DEITY
85-121551-0007 IS FOLLOWED BY GREAT FLAME PERCHANCE WITH BETTER VOICES AFTER ME SHALL PRAYER BE MADE THAT CYRRHA MAY RESPOND TO MORTAL MEN BY PASSAGES DIVERSE UPRISES THE WORLD'S LAMP
85-121551-0008 BUT BY THAT ONE WHICH CIRCLES FOUR UNITETH WITH THREE CROSSES WITH BETTER COURSE AND WITH A BETTER STAR CONJOINED IT ISSUES AND THE MUNDANE WAX TEMPERS AND STAMPS MORE AFTER ITS OWN FASHION
85-121551-0009 I SAW TURNED ROUND AND GAZING AT THE SUN NEVER DID EAGLE FASTEN SO UPON IT AND EVEN AS A SECOND RAY IS WONT TO ISSUE FROM THE FIRST AND REASCEND LIKE TO A PILGRIM WHO WOULD FAIN RETURN
85-121551-0010 THUS OF HER ACTION THROUGH THE EYES INFUSED IN MY IMAGINATION MINE I MADE AND SUNWARD FIXED MINE EYES BEYOND OUR WONT
85-121551-0011 THERE MUCH IS LAWFUL WHICH IS HERE UNLAWFUL UNTO OUR POWERS BY VIRTUE OF THE PLACE MADE FOR THE HUMAN SPECIES AS ITS OWN NOT LONG I BORE IT NOR SO LITTLE WHILE BUT
85-121551-0012 I BEHELD IT SPARKLE ROUND ABOUT LIKE IRON THAT COMES MOLTEN FROM THE FIRE AND SUDDENLY IT SEEMED THAT DAY TO DAY WAS ADDED AS IF HE WHO HAS THE POWER HAD WITH ANOTHER SUN THE HEAVEN ADORNED
85-121551-0013 TASTING OF THE HERB THAT MADE HIM PEER OF THE OTHER GODS BENEATH THE SEA TO REPRESENT TRANSHUMANISE IN WORDS IMPOSSIBLE WERE THE EXAMPLE THEN
85-121551-0014 SUFFICE HIM FOR WHOM GRACE THE EXPERIENCE RESERVES IF I WAS MERELY WHAT OF ME THOU NEWLY CREATEDST LOVE WHO GOVERNEST THE HEAVEN THOU KNOWEST WHO DIDST LIFT ME WITH THY LIGHT
85-121551-0015 E'ER MADE A LAKE SO WIDELY SPREAD ABROAD THE NEWNESS OF THE SOUND AND THE GREAT LIGHT KINDLED IN ME A LONGING FOR THEIR CAUSE NEVER BEFORE WITH SUCH ACUTENESS FELT WHENCE SHE
85-121551-0016 WHO SAW ME AS I SAW MYSELF TO QUIET IN ME MY PERTURBED MIND OPENED HER MOUTH ERE I DID MINE TO ASK AND SHE BEGAN THOU MAKEST THYSELF SO DULL
85-121551-0017 WITH FALSE IMAGINING THAT THOU SEEST NOT WHAT THOU WOULDST SEE IF THOU HADST SHAKEN IT OFF THOU ART NOT UPON EARTH AS THOU BELIEVEST BUT LIGHTNING FLEEING ITS APPROPRIATE SITE
85-121551-0018 NE'ER RAN AS THOU WHO THITHERWARD RETURNEST IF OF MY FORMER DOUBT I WAS DIVESTED BY THESE BRIEF LITTLE WORDS MORE SMILED THAN SPOKEN I IN A NEW ONE WAS THE MORE ENSNARED AND SAID
85-121551-0019 HER EYES DIRECTED TOW'RDS ME WITH THAT LOOK A MOTHER CASTS ON A DELIRIOUS CHILD AND SHE BEGAN ALL THINGS WHATE'ER THEY BE HAVE ORDER AMONG THEMSELVES AND THIS IS FORM
85-121551-0020 THAT MAKES THE UNIVERSE RESEMBLE GOD HERE DO THE HIGHER CREATURES SEE THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE ETERNAL POWER WHICH IS THE END
85-121551-0021 IN THE ORDER THAT I SPEAK OF ARE INCLINED ALL NATURES BY THEIR DESTINIES DIVERSE MORE OR LESS NEAR UNTO THEIR ORIGIN HENCE THEY MOVE ONWARD UNTO PORTS DIVERSE
85-121551-0022 O'ER THE GREAT SEA OF BEING AND EACH ONE WITH INSTINCT GIVEN IT WHICH BEARS IT ON THIS BEARS AWAY THE FIRE TOWARDS THE MOON THIS IS IN MORTAL HEARTS THE MOTIVE POWER THIS BINDS TOGETHER
85-121551-0023 AND UNITES THE EARTH NOR ONLY THE CREATED THINGS THAT ARE WITHOUT INTELLIGENCE THIS BOW SHOOTS FORTH BUT THOSE THAT HAVE BOTH INTELLECT AND LOVE THE PROVIDENCE THAT REGULATES ALL THIS
85-121551-0024 MAKES WITH ITS LIGHT THE HEAVEN FOREVER QUIET WHEREIN THAT TURNS WHICH HAS THE GREATEST HASTE AND THITHER NOW AS TO A SITE DECREED BEARS US AWAY THE VIRTUE OF THAT CORD
85-121551-0025 DOTH DEVIATE SOMETIMES THE CREATURE WHO THE POWER POSSESSES THOUGH THUS IMPELLED TO SWERVE SOME OTHER WAY IN THE SAME WISE AS ONE MAY SEE THE FIRE FALL FROM A CLOUD
85-121551-0026 SHE HEAVENWARD TURNED AGAIN HER FACE PARADISO CANTO TWO
85-121551-0027 WHO IN SOME PRETTY LITTLE BOAT EAGER TO LISTEN HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING BEHIND MY SHIP THAT SINGING SAILS ALONG TURN BACK TO LOOK AGAIN UPON YOUR SHORES DO NOT PUT OUT TO SEA LEST

85-121551-0029 YE OTHER FEW WHO HAVE THE NECK UPLIFTED
85-121551-0030 WHO UNTO COLCHOS PASSED WERE NOT SO WONDER STRUCK AS YOU SHALL BE WHEN JASON THEY BEHELD A PLOUGHMAN MADE THE CON CREATED AND PERPETUAL THIRST FOR THE REALM DEIFORM DID BEAR US ON AS SWIFT
85-121551-0031 ALMOST AS YE THE HEAVENS BEHOLD
85-121551-0032 AND IN SUCH SPACE PERCHANCE AS STRIKES A BOLT AND FLIES AND FROM THE NOTCH UNLOCKS ITSELF
85-121551-0033 TOWARDS ME TURNING BLITHE AS BEAUTIFUL SAID UNTO ME FIX GRATEFULLY THY MIND ON GOD WHO UNTO THE FIRST STAR HAS BROUGHT US
85-121551-0034 IT SEEMED TO ME A CLOUD ENCOMPASSED US LUMINOUS DENSE CONSOLIDATE AND BRIGHT AS ADAMANT ON WHICH THE SUN IS STRIKING
85-121551-0035 INTO ITSELF DID THE ETERNAL PEARL RECEIVE US EVEN AS WATER DOTH RECEIVE A RAY OF LIGHT REMAINING STILL UNBROKEN IF I WAS BODY
85-121551-0036 AND WE HERE CONCEIVE NOT HOW ONE DIMENSION TOLERATES ANOTHER WHICH NEEDS MUST BE IF BODY ENTER BODY MORE THE DESIRE SHOULD BE ENKINDLED IN US THAT ESSENCE TO BEHOLD WHEREIN IS SEEN HOW GOD AND OUR OWN NATURE WERE UNITED
85-121551-0037 MADONNA AS DEVOUTLY AS MOST I CAN DO I GIVE THANKS TO HIM WHO HAS REMOVED ME FROM THE MORTAL WORLD BUT TELL ME WHAT THE DUSKY SPOTS MAY BE UPON THIS BODY WHICH BELOW ON EARTH
85-121551-0038 MAKE PEOPLE TELL THAT FABULOUS TALE OF CAIN SOMEWHAT SHE SMILED AND THEN IF THE OPINION OF MORTALS BE ERRONEOUS SHE SAID
85-121551-0039 WHERE'ER THE KEY OF SENSE DOTH NOT UNLOCK
85-121551-0040 FORASMUCH AS FOLLOWING THE SENSES THOU SEEST THAT THE REASON HAS SHORT WINGS BUT TELL ME WHAT THOU THINK'ST OF IT THYSELF AND I
85-121551-0041 IF THIS WERE CAUSED BY RARE AND DENSE ALONE ONE ONLY VIRTUE WOULD THERE BE IN ALL OR MORE OR LESS DIFFUSED OR EQUALLY VIRTUES DIVERSE
85-121551-0042 MUST BE PERFORCE THE FRUITS OF FORMAL PRINCIPLES AND THESE SAVE ONE OF COURSE WOULD BY THY REASONING BE DESTROYED BESIDES IF RARITY WERE OF THIS DIMNESS THE CAUSE THOU ASKEST
85-121551-0043 EITHER THROUGH AND THROUGH THIS PLANET THUS ATTENUATE WERE OF MATTER OR ELSE AS IN A BODY IS APPORTIONED THE FAT AND LEAN SO IN LIKE MANNER THIS WOULD IN ITS VOLUME INTERCHANGE THE LEAVES
85-121551-0044 AND IF IT CHANCE THE OTHER I DEMOLISH THEN FALSIFIED WILL THY OPINION BE BUT IF THIS RARITY GO NOT THROUGH AND THROUGH THERE NEEDS MUST BE A LIMIT
85-121551-0045 BEYOND WHICH ITS CONTRARY PREVENTS THE FURTHER PASSING AND THENCE THE FOREIGN RADIANCE IS REFLECTED EVEN AS A COLOUR COMETH BACK FROM GLASS THE WHICH BEHIND ITSELF CONCEALETH LEAD
85-121551-0046 NOW THOU WILT SAY THE SUNBEAM SHOWS ITSELF MORE DIMLY THERE THAN IN THE OTHER PARTS BY BEING THERE REFLECTED FARTHER BACK
85-121551-0047 WHICH IS WONT TO BE THE FOUNTAIN TO THE RIVERS OF YOUR ARTS THREE MIRRORS SHALT THOU TAKE AND TWO REMOVE ALIKE FROM THEE THE OTHER MORE REMOTE BETWEEN THE FORMER TWO SHALL MEET THINE EYES
85-121551-0048 TURNED TOWARDS THESE CAUSE THAT BEHIND THY BACK BE PLACED A LIGHT ILLUMING THE THREE MIRRORS AND COMING BACK TO THEE BY ALL REFLECTED THOUGH IN ITS QUANTITY BE NOT SO AMPLE THE IMAGE MOST REMOTE
85-121551-0049 THERE SHALT THOU SEE HOW IT PERFORCE IS EQUALLY RESPLENDENT NOW
85-121551-0050 THEE THUS REMAINING IN THY INTELLECT WILL I INFORM WITH SUCH A LIVING LIGHT THAT IT SHALL TREMBLE IN ITS ASPECT TO THEE WITHIN THE HEAVEN OF THE DIVINE REPOSE REVOLVES A BODY
85-121551-0051 THE OTHER SPHERES BY VARIOUS DIFFERENCES ALL THE DISTINCTIONS WHICH THEY HAVE WITHIN THEM DISPOSE UNTO THEIR ENDS AND THEIR EFFECTS THUS DO THESE ORGANS OF THE WORLD PROCEED AS THOU PERCEIVEST NOW FROM GRADE TO GRADE
85-121551-0052 SINCE FROM ABOVE THEY TAKE AND ACT BENEATH OBSERVE ME WELL HOW THROUGH THIS PLACE I COME UNTO THE TRUTH THOU WISHEST THAT HEREAFTER THOU MAYST ALONE KNOW HOW TO KEEP THE FORD
85-121551-0053 THE POWER AND MOTION OF THE HOLY SPHERES AS FROM THE ARTISAN THE HAMMER'S CRAFT FORTH FROM THE BLESSED MOTORS MUST PROCEED THE HEAVEN WHICH LIGHTS SO MANIFOLD MAKE FAIR
85-121551-0054 FROM THE INTELLIGENCE PROFOUND WHICH TURNS IT THE IMAGE TAKES AND MAKES OF IT A SEAL AND EVEN AS THE SOUL WITHIN YOUR DUST THROUGH MEMBERS DIFFERENT AND ACCOMMODATED TO FACULTIES DIVERSE EXPANDS ITSELF
85-121551-0055 SO LIKEWISE THIS INTELLIGENCE DIFFUSES ITS VIRTUE MULTIPLIED AMONG THE STARS ITSELF REVOLVING ON ITS UNITY VIRTUE DIVERSE DOTH A DIVERSE ALLOYAGE MAKE
85-121551-0056 WITH THE PRECIOUS BODY THAT IT QUICKENS IN WHICH AS LIFE IN YOU IT IS COMBINED FROM THE GLAD NATURE WHENCE IT IS DERIVED THE MINGLED VIRTUE THROUGH THE BODY SHINES EVEN AS GLADNESS THROUGH THE LIVING PUPIL
85-121551-0057 FROM THIS PROCEEDS WHATE'ER FROM LIGHT TO LIGHT APPEARETH DIFFERENT NOT FROM DENSE AND RARE THIS IS THE FORMAL PRINCIPLE THAT PRODUCES ACCORDING TO ITS GOODNESS DARK AND BRIGHT
85-121551-0058 PARADISO CANTO THREE THAT SUN WHICH ERST WITH LOVE MY BOSOM WARMED OF BEAUTEOUS TRUTH HAD UNTO ME DISCOVERED
85-121551-0059 BY PROVING AND REPROVING THE SWEET ASPECT AND THAT I MIGHT CONFESS MYSELF CONVINCED AND CONFIDENT SO FAR AS WAS BEFITTING I LIFTED MORE ERECT MY HEAD TO SPEAK BUT THERE APPEARED A VISION
85-121551-0060 THAT MY CONFESSION I REMEMBERED NOT SUCH AS THROUGH POLISHED AND TRANSPARENT GLASS OR WATERS CRYSTALLINE AND UNDISTURBED BUT NOT SO DEEP AS THAT THEIR BED BE LOST COME BACK AGAIN THE OUTLINES OF OUR FACES SO FEEBLE
85-121551-0061 THAT A PEARL ON FOREHEAD WHITE COMES NOT LESS SPEEDILY UNTO OUR EYES SUCH SAW I MANY FACES PROMPT TO SPEAK SO THAT I RAN IN ERROR OPPOSITE TO THAT WHICH KINDLED LOVE TWIXT MAN AND FOUNTAIN
85-121551-0062 INTO THE LIGHT OF MY SWEET GUIDE WHO SMILING KINDLED IN HER HOLY EYES MARVEL THOU NOT SHE SAID TO ME BECAUSE I SMILE AT THIS THY PUERILE CONCEIT
85-121551-0063 SINCE ON THE TRUTH IT TRUSTS NOT YET ITS FOOT BUT TURNS THEE AS TIS WONT ON EMPTINESS TRUE SUBSTANCES ARE THESE WHICH THOU BEHOLDEST HERE RELEGATE FOR BREAKING OF SOME VOW THEREFORE SPEAK WITH THEM
85-121551-0064 LISTEN AND BELIEVE FOR THE TRUE LIGHT WHICH GIVETH PEACE TO THEM PERMITS THEM NOT TO TURN FROM IT THEIR FEET AND I UNTO THE SHADE THAT SEEMED MOST WISHFUL TO SPEAK DIRECTED ME AND I BEGAN
85-121551-0065 AS ONE WHOM TOO GREAT EAGERNESS BEWILDERS O WELL CREATED SPIRIT WHO IN THE RAYS OF LIFE ETERNAL DOST THE SWEETNESS TASTE WHICH BEING UNTASTED NE'ER IS COMPREHENDED
85-121551-0066 GRATEFUL TWILL BE TO ME IF THOU CONTENT ME BOTH WITH THY NAME
85-121551-0067 WHEREAT SHE PROMPTLY AND WITH LAUGHING EYES OUR CHARITY DOTH NEVER SHUT THE DOORS AGAINST A JUST DESIRE EXCEPT AS ONE WHO WILLS THAT ALL HER COURT BE LIKE HERSELF
85-121551-0068 ALL OUR AFFECTIONS THAT ALONE INFLAMED ARE IN THE PLEASURE OF THE HOLY GHOST REJOICE AT BEING OF HIS ORDER FORMED AND THIS ALLOTMENT WHICH APPEARS SO LOW
85-121551-0069 THEREFORE IS GIVEN US BECAUSE OUR VOWS HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED AND IN SOME PART VOID WHENCE I TO HER IN YOUR MIRACULOUS ASPECTS THERE SHINES I KNOW NOT WHAT OF THE DIVINE
85-121551-0070 WHICH DOTH TRANSFORM YOU FROM OUR FIRST CONCEPTIONS THEREFORE I WAS NOT SWIFT IN MY REMEMBRANCE BUT WHAT THOU TELLEST ME NOW AIDS ME SO THAT THE REFIGURING IS EASIER TO ME BUT TELL ME
85-121551-0071 YE WHO IN THIS PLACE ARE HAPPY ARE YOU DESIROUS OF A HIGHER PLACE TO SEE MORE OR TO MAKE YOURSELVES MORE FRIENDS FIRST WITH THOSE OTHER SHADES SHE SMILED A LITTLE
85-121551-0072 THEREAFTER ANSWERED ME SO FULL OF GLADNESS SHE SEEMED TO BURN IN THE FIRST FIRE OF LOVE BROTHER OUR WILL IS QUIETED BY VIRTUE OF CHARITY
85-121551-0073 NAY TIS ESSENTIAL TO THIS BLEST EXISTENCE TO KEEP ITSELF WITHIN THE WILL DIVINE WHEREBY OUR VERY WISHES ARE MADE ONE SO THAT AS WE ARE STATION ABOVE STATION THROUGHOUT THIS REALM
85-121551-0074 TO ALL THE REALM TIS PLEASING AS TO THE KING WHO MAKES HIS WILL OUR WILL AND HIS WILL IS OUR PEACE THIS IS THE SEA TO WHICH IS MOVING ONWARD WHATSOEVER IT DOTH CREATE
85-121551-0075 AND ALL THAT NATURE MAKES THEN IT WAS CLEAR TO ME HOW EVERYWHERE IN HEAVEN IS PARADISE ALTHOUGH THE GRACE OF GOOD SUPREME THERE RAIN NOT IN ONE MEASURE BUT AS IT COMES TO PASS
85-121551-0076 IF ONE FOOD SATES AND FOR ANOTHER STILL REMAINS THE LONGING WE ASK FOR THIS AND THAT DECLINE WITH THANKS E'EN THUS DID I WITH GESTURE AND WITH WORD
85-121551-0077 TO LEARN FROM HER WHAT WAS THE WEB WHEREIN SHE DID NOT PLY THE SHUTTLE TO THE END A PERFECT LIFE AND MERIT HIGH IN HEAVEN A LADY O'ER US SAID SHE BY WHOSE RULE DOWN IN YOUR WORLD THEY VEST AND VEIL THEMSELVES
85-121551-0078 THAT UNTIL DEATH THEY MAY BOTH WATCH AND SLEEP BESIDE THAT SPOUSE WHO EVERY VOW ACCEPTS WHICH CHARITY CONFORMETH TO HIS PLEASURE
85-121551-0079 AND PLEDGED ME TO THE PATHWAY OF HER SECT THEN MEN ACCUSTOMED UNTO EVIL MORE THAN UNTO GOOD FROM THE SWEET CLOISTER TORE ME GOD KNOWS WHAT AFTERWARD MY LIFE BECAME
85-121551-0080 THIS OTHER SPLENDOUR WHICH TO THEE REVEALS ITSELF ON MY RIGHT SIDE AND IS ENKINDLED WITH ALL THE ILLUMINATION OF OUR SPHERE WHAT OF MYSELF I SAY APPLIES TO HER
85-121551-0081 OF THE HEART'S VEIL SHE NEVER WAS DIVESTED OF GREAT COSTANZA THIS IS THE EFFULGENCE
85-121551-0082 BROUGHT FORTH THE THIRD AND LATEST PUISSANCE THUS UNTO ME SHE SPAKE AND THEN BEGAN AVE MARIA SINGING AND IN SINGING VANISHED AS THROUGH DEEP WATER SOMETHING HEAVY
85-121551-0083 MY SIGHT THAT FOLLOWED HER
85-121551-0084 WHEN IT HAD LOST HER TURNED ROUND UNTO THE MARK OF MORE DESIRE AND WHOLLY UNTO BEATRICE REVERTED BUT SHE SUCH LIGHTNINGS FLASHED INTO MINE EYES
85-121551-0085 AND TEMPTING A FREE MAN WOULD DIE OF HUNGER ERE EITHER HE COULD BRING UNTO HIS TEETH SO WOULD A LAMB BETWEEN THE RAVENINGS OF TWO FIERCE WOLVES STAND FEARING BOTH ALIKE
85-121551-0086 HENCE IF I HELD MY PEACE MYSELF I BLAME NOT
85-121551-0087 SINCE IT MUST BE SO NOR DO I COMMEND I HELD MY PEACE BUT MY DESIRE WAS PAINTED UPON MY FACE AND QUESTIONING WITH THAT MORE FERVENT FAR THAN BY ARTICULATE SPEECH
85-121551-0088 BEATRICE DID AS DANIEL HAD DONE RELIEVING NEBUCHADNEZZAR FROM THE WRATH WHICH RENDERED HIM UNJUSTLY MERCILESS AND SAID WELL SEE I HOW ATTRACTETH THEE ONE AND THE OTHER WISH
85-121551-0089 SO THAT FORTH IT DOES NOT BREATHE THOU ARGUEST IF GOOD WILL BE PERMANENT THE VIOLENCE OF OTHERS FOR WHAT REASON DOTH IT DECREASE THE MEASURE OF MY MERIT AGAIN FOR DOUBTING
85-121551-0090 FURNISH THEE OCCASION SOULS SEEMING TO RETURN UNTO THE STARS ACCORDING TO THE SENTIMENT OF PLATO THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS WHICH UPON THY WISH ARE THRUSTING EQUALLY AND THEREFORE FIRST WILL I TREAT THAT WHICH HATH THE MOST OF GALL
85-121551-0091 HE OF THE SERAPHIM MOST ABSORBED IN GOD MOSES AND SAMUEL AND WHICHEVER JOHN THOU MAYST SELECT I SAY AND EVEN MARY HAVE NOT IN ANY OTHER HEAVEN THEIR SEATS THAN HAVE THOSE SPIRITS THAT JUST APPEARED TO THEE
85-121551-0092 NOR OF EXISTENCE MORE OR FEWER YEARS BUT ALL MAKE BEAUTIFUL THE PRIMAL CIRCLE AND HAVE SWEET LIFE IN DIFFERENT DEGREES BY FEELING MORE OR LESS THE ETERNAL BREATH THEY SHOWED THEMSELVES HERE
85-121551-0093 NOT BECAUSE ALLOTTED THIS SPHERE HAS BEEN TO THEM BUT TO GIVE SIGN OF THE CELESTIAL WHICH IS LEAST EXALTED
85-121551-0094 SINCE ONLY THROUGH THE SENSE IT APPREHENDETH
85-121551-0095 ON THIS ACCOUNT
85-121551-0096 AND FEET AND HANDS TO GOD ATTRIBUTES AND MEANS SOMETHING ELSE AND HOLY CHURCH UNDER AN ASPECT HUMAN GABRIEL AND MICHAEL REPRESENT TO YOU AND HIM WHO MADE TOBIAS WHOLE AGAIN THAT WHICH TIMAEUS ARGUES OF THE SOUL
85-121551-0097 DOTH NOT RESEMBLE THAT WHICH HERE IS SEEN BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT AS HE SPEAKS HE THINKS HE SAYS THE SOUL UNTO ITS STAR RETURNS BELIEVING IT TO HAVE BEEN SEVERED THENCE WHENEVER NATURE GAVE IT AS A FORM
85-121551-0098 PERHAPS HIS BOW DOTH HIT UPON SOME TRUTH
85-121551-0099 THE OTHER DOUBT WHICH DOTH DISQUIET THEE LESS VENOM HAS FOR ITS MALEVOLENCE COULD NEVER LEAD THEE OTHERWHERE FROM ME THAT AS UNJUST OUR JUSTICE SHOULD APPEAR IN EYES OF MORTALS IS AN ARGUMENT OF FAITH
85-121551-0100 AND NOT OF SIN HERETICAL BUT STILL THAT YOUR PERCEPTION MAY BE ABLE TO THOROUGHLY PENETRATE THIS VERITY AS THOU DESIREST I WILL SATISFY THEE
85-121551-0101 IF THEIR WILL HAD BEEN PERFECT LIKE TO THAT WHICH LAWRENCE FAST UPON HIS GRIDIRON HELD AND MUTIUS MADE SEVERE TO HIS OWN HAND IT WOULD HAVE URGED THEM BACK ALONG THE ROAD WHENCE THEY WERE DRAGGED AS SOON AS THEY WERE FREE
85-121551-0102 BUT SUCH A SOLID WILL IS ALL TOO RARE AND BY THESE WORDS IF THOU HAST GATHERED THEM AS THOU SHOULDST DO THE ARGUMENT IS REFUTED THAT WOULD HAVE STILL ANNOYED THEE MANY TIMES
85-121551-0103 BUT NOW ANOTHER PASSAGE RUNS ACROSS BEFORE THINE EYES AND SUCH THAT BY THYSELF THOU COULDST NOT THREAD IT ERE THOU WOULDST BE WEARY I HAVE FOR CERTAIN PUT INTO THY MIND THAT SOUL BEATIFIED COULD NEVER LIE
85-121551-0104 FOR IT IS NEAR THE PRIMAL TRUTH AND THEN THOU FROM PICCARDA MIGHT'ST HAVE HEARD COSTANZA KEPT AFFECTION FOR THE VEIL SO THAT SHE SEEMETH HERE TO CONTRADICT ME MANY TIMES BROTHER HAS IT COME TO PASS THAT TO ESCAPE FROM PERIL
85-121551-0105 WITH RELUCTANCE THAT HAS BEEN DONE IT WAS NOT RIGHT TO DO E'EN AS ALCMAEON
85-121551-0106 THAT FORCE WITH WILL COMMINGLES AND THEY CAUSE THAT THE OFFENCES CANNOT BE EXCUSED WILL ABSOLUTE CONSENTETH NOT TO EVIL BUT IN SO FAR CONSENTETH AS IT FEARS IF IT REFRAIN
85-121551-0107 TO FALL INTO MORE HARM HENCE WHEN PICCARDA USES THIS EXPRESSION SHE MEANETH THE WILL ABSOLUTE AND I THE OTHER
85-121551-0108 SUCH WAS THE FLOWING OF THE HOLY RIVER THAT ISSUED FROM THE FOUNT WHENCE SPRINGS ALL TRUTH THIS PUT TO REST MY WISHES ONE AND ALL O LOVE OF THE FIRST LOVER
85-121551-0109 O DIVINE SAID I FORTHWITH WHOSE SPEECH INUNDATES ME AND WARMS ME SO IT MORE AND MORE REVIVES ME MY OWN AFFECTION IS NOT SO PROFOUND AS TO SUFFICE IN RENDERING GRACE FOR GRACE
85-121551-0110 WELL I PERCEIVE THAT NEVER SATED IS OUR INTELLECT UNLESS THE TRUTH ILLUME IT BEYOND WHICH NOTHING TRUE EXPANDS ITSELF IT RESTS THEREIN AS WILD BEAST IN HIS LAIR WHEN IT ATTAINS IT
85-121551-0111 AND IT CAN ATTAIN IT IF NOT THEN EACH DESIRE WOULD FRUSTRATE BE
85-121551-0112 DOUBT AT THE FOOT OF TRUTH AND THIS IS NATURE WHICH TO THE TOP FROM HEIGHT TO HEIGHT IMPELS US THIS DOTH INVITE ME
85-121551-0113 ANOTHER TRUTH WHICH IS OBSCURE TO ME I WISH TO KNOW IF MAN CAN SATISFY YOU FOR BROKEN VOWS WITH OTHER GOOD DEEDS SO THAT IN YOUR BALANCE THEY WILL NOT BE LIGHT
85-121551-0114 BEATRICE GAZED UPON ME WITH HER EYES FULL OF THE SPARKS OF LOVE AND SO DIVINE THAT OVERCOME MY POWER I TURNED MY BACK AND ALMOST LOST MYSELF WITH EYES DOWNCAST PARADISO
85-121551-0115 IF IN THE HEAT OF LOVE I FLAME UPON THEE BEYOND THE MEASURE THAT ON EARTH IS SEEN SO THAT THE VALOUR OF THINE EYES I VANQUISH MARVEL THOU NOT THEREAT FOR THIS PROCEEDS FROM PERFECT SIGHT
85-121551-0116 WHICH AS IT APPREHENDS TO THE GOOD APPREHENDED MOVES ITS FEET WELL I PERCEIVE HOW IS ALREADY SHINING INTO THINE INTELLECT THE ETERNAL LIGHT THAT ONLY SEEN ENKINDLES ALWAYS LOVE
85-121551-0117 AND IF SOME OTHER THING YOUR LOVE SEDUCE TIS NOTHING BUT A VESTIGE OF THE SAME ILL UNDERSTOOD WHICH THERE IS SHINING THROUGH THOU FAIN WOULDST KNOW
85-121551-0118 IF WITH ANOTHER SERVICE FOR BROKEN VOW CAN SUCH RETURN BE MADE AS TO SECURE THE SOUL FROM FURTHER CLAIM THIS CANTO THUS DID BEATRICE BEGIN AND AS A MAN WHO BREAKS NOT OFF HIS SPEECH
85-121551-0119 CONTINUED THUS HER HOLY ARGUMENT THE GREATEST GIFT THAT IN HIS LARGESS GOD CREATING MADE AND UNTO HIS OWN GOODNESS NEAREST CONFORMED AND THAT WHICH HE DOTH PRIZE MOST HIGHLY IS THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL
85-121551-0120 A SACRIFICE IS OF THIS TREASURE MADE SUCH AS I SAY AND MADE BY ITS OWN ACT WHAT CAN BE RENDERED THEN AS COMPENSATION THINK'ST THOU TO MAKE GOOD USE OF WHAT THOU'ST OFFERED
85-121551-0121 WITH GAINS ILL GOTTEN THOU WOULDST DO GOOD DEED NOW ART THOU CERTAIN OF THE GREATER POINT BUT BECAUSE HOLY CHURCH IN THIS DISPENSES WHICH SEEMS AGAINST THE TRUTH WHICH I HAVE SHOWN THEE
85-121551-0122 BECAUSE THE SOLID FOOD WHICH THOU HAST TAKEN REQUIRETH FURTHER AID FOR THY DIGESTION OPEN THY MIND TO THAT WHICH I REVEAL AND FIX IT THERE WITHIN FOR TIS NOT KNOWLEDGE
85-121551-0123 THE HAVING HEARD WITHOUT RETAINING IT IN THE ESSENCE OF THIS SACRIFICE TWO THINGS CONVENE TOGETHER AND THE ONE IS THAT OF WHICH TIS MADE THE OTHER IS THE AGREEMENT THIS LAST FOR EVERMORE IS CANCELLED NOT
85-121551-0124 UNLESS COMPLIED WITH AND CONCERNING THIS WITH SUCH PRECISION HAS ABOVE BEEN SPOKEN THEREFORE IT WAS ENJOINED UPON THE HEBREWS TO OFFER STILL THOUGH SOMETIMES WHAT WAS OFFERED MIGHT BE COMMUTED AS THOU OUGHT'ST TO KNOW THE OTHER
85-121551-0125 WHICH IS KNOWN TO THEE AS MATTER MAY WELL INDEED BE SUCH THAT ONE ERRS NOT
85-121551-0126 AT HIS ARBITRAMENT WITHOUT THE TURNING BOTH OF THE WHITE AND OF THE YELLOW KEY AND EVERY PERMUTATION DEEM AS FOOLISH IF IN THE SUBSTITUTE THE THING RELINQUISHED AS THE FOUR IS IN SIX BE NOT CONTAINED
85-121551-0127 THEREFORE WHATEVER THING HAS SO GREAT WEIGHT IN VALUE THAT IT DRAGS DOWN EVERY BALANCE CANNOT BE SATISFIED WITH OTHER SPENDING LET MORTALS NEVER TAKE A VOW IN JEST
85-121551-0128 BE FAITHFUL AND NOT BLIND IN DOING THAT AS JEPHTHAH WAS IN HIS FIRST OFFERING WHOM MORE BESEEMED TO SAY I HAVE DONE WRONG THAN TO DO WORSE BY KEEPING
85-121551-0129 AND AS FOOLISH THOU THE GREAT LEADER OF THE GREEKS WILT FIND WHENCE WEPT IPHIGENIA HER FAIR FACE AND MADE FOR HER BOTH WISE AND SIMPLE WEEP
85-121551-0130 BE YE MORE SERIOUS IN YOUR MOVEMENTS BE YE NOT LIKE A FEATHER AT EACH WIND AND THINK NOT EVERY WATER WASHES YOU YE HAVE THE OLD AND THE NEW TESTAMENT AND THE PASTOR OF THE CHURCH WHO GUIDETH YOU LET THIS SUFFICE YOU UNTO YOUR SALVATION
85-121551-0131 IF EVIL APPETITE CRY AUGHT ELSE TO YOU BE YE AS MEN AND NOT AS SILLY SHEEP SO THAT THE JEW AMONG YOU MAY NOT MOCK YOU BE YE NOT AS THE LAMB THAT DOTH ABANDON ITS MOTHER'S MILK
85-121551-0132 SILENCE IMPOSED UPON MY EAGER MIND THAT HAD ALREADY IN ADVANCE NEW QUESTIONS AND AS AN ARROW THAT UPON THE MARK STRIKES ERE THE BOWSTRING QUIET HATH BECOME SO DID WE SPEED INTO THE SECOND REALM
85-121551-0133 MY LADY THERE SO JOYFUL I BEHELD AS INTO THE BRIGHTNESS OF THAT HEAVEN SHE ENTERED MORE LUMINOUS THEREAT THE PLANET GREW AND IF THE STAR ITSELF WAS CHANGED AND SMILED
85-121551-0134 WHAT BECAME I WHO BY MY NATURE AM EXCEEDING MUTABLE IN EVERY GUISE AS IN A FISH POND WHICH IS PURE AND TRANQUIL THE FISHES DRAW TO THAT WHICH FROM WITHOUT COMES IN SUCH FASHION THAT THEIR FOOD THEY DEEM IT
85-121551-0135 FULL OF BEATITUDE THE SHADE WAS SEEN BY THE EFFULGENCE CLEAR THAT ISSUED FROM IT THINK READER IF WHAT HERE IS JUST BEGINNING NO FARTHER SHOULD PROCEED
85-121551-0136 THOU'LT SEE HOW I FROM THESE WAS IN DESIRE OF HEARING THEIR CONDITIONS AS THEY UNTO MINE EYES WERE MANIFEST O THOU WELL BORN UNTO WHOM GRACE CONCEDES TO SEE THE THRONES OF THE ETERNAL TRIUMPH
85-121551-0137 OR EVER YET THE WARFARE BE ABANDONED WITH LIGHT THAT THROUGH THE WHOLE OF HEAVEN IS SPREAD KINDLED ARE WE AND HENCE IF THOU DESIREST TO KNOW OF US AT THINE OWN PLEASURE SATE THEE
85-121551-0138 AND BY BEATRICE SPEAK SPEAK SECURELY AND BELIEVE THEM EVEN AS GODS WELL I PERCEIVE HOW THOU DOST NEST THYSELF IN THINE OWN LIGHT AND DRAWEST IT FROM THINE EYES
85-121551-0139 BECAUSE THEY CORUSCATE WHEN THOU DOST SMILE BUT KNOW NOT WHO THOU ART NOR WHY THOU HAST SPIRIT AUGUST THY STATION IN THE SPHERE THAT VEILS ITSELF TO MEN IN ALIEN RAYS
85-121551-0140 EVEN AS THE SUN THAT DOTH CONCEAL HIMSELF BY TOO MUCH LIGHT
