1646-121409-0000 WELL MADAME SAID DE WINTER WHEN THE QUEEN HAD DISMISSED HER ATTENDANTS WELL MY LORD WHAT I FORESAW HAS COME TO PASS WHAT DOES THE CARDINAL REFUSE TO RECEIVE THE KING FRANCE REFUSE HOSPITALITY TO AN UNFORTUNATE PRINCE
1646-121409-0001 AY BUT IT IS FOR THE FIRST TIME MADAME I DID NOT SAY FRANCE MY LORD I SAID THE CARDINAL AND THE CARDINAL IS NOT EVEN A FRENCHMAN BUT DID YOU SEE THE QUEEN IT IS USELESS REPLIED HENRIETTA THE QUEEN WILL NOT SAY YES WHEN THE CARDINAL SAYS NO
1646-121409-0002 ARE YOU NOT AWARE THAT THIS ITALIAN DIRECTS EVERYTHING BOTH INDOORS AND OUT AND MOREOVER I SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED HAD WE BEEN FORESTALLED BY CROMWELL HE WAS EMBARRASSED WHILST SPEAKING TO ME AND YET QUITE FIRM IN HIS DETERMINATION TO REFUSE
1646-121409-0003 THEN DID YOU NOT OBSERVE THE AGITATION IN THE PALAIS ROYAL THE PASSING TO AND FRO OF BUSY PEOPLE CAN THEY HAVE RECEIVED ANY NEWS MY LORD NOT FROM ENGLAND MADAME I MADE SUCH HASTE THAT I AM CERTAIN OF NOT HAVING BEEN FORESTALLED
1646-121409-0004 I SET OUT THREE DAYS AGO PASSING MIRACULOUSLY THROUGH THE PURITAN ARMY AND I TOOK POST HORSES WITH MY SERVANT TONY THE HORSES UPON WHICH WE WERE MOUNTED WERE BOUGHT IN PARIS BESIDES THE KING I AM CERTAIN AWAITS YOUR MAJESTY'S REPLY BEFORE RISKING ANYTHING
1646-121409-0005 YOU WILL TELL HIM MY LORD RESUMED THE QUEEN DESPAIRINGLY THAT I CAN DO NOTHING THAT I HAVE SUFFERED AS MUCH AS HIMSELF MORE THAN HE HAS OBLIGED AS I AM TO EAT THE BREAD OF EXILE AND TO ASK HOSPITALITY FROM FALSE FRIENDS WHO SMILE AT MY TEARS
1646-121409-0006 AND AS REGARDS HIS ROYAL PERSON HE MUST SACRIFICE IT GENEROUSLY AND DIE LIKE A KING I SHALL GO AND DIE BY HIS SIDE MADAME MADAME EXCLAIMED DE WINTER YOUR MAJESTY ABANDONS YOURSELF TO DESPAIR AND YET PERHAPS THERE STILL REMAINS SOME HOPE
1646-121409-0007 WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH FOUR FOUR DEVOTED RESOLUTE MEN CAN DO MUCH ASSURE YOURSELF MADAME AND THOSE OF WHOM I SPEAK PERFORMED GREAT THINGS AT ONE TIME AND WHERE ARE THESE FOUR MEN AH THAT IS WHAT I DO NOT KNOW
1646-121409-0008 AND THESE MEN WERE YOUR FRIENDS ONE OF THEM HELD MY LIFE IN HIS HANDS AND GAVE IT TO ME I KNOW NOT WHETHER HE IS STILL MY FRIEND BUT SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE REMAINED HIS AND THESE MEN ARE IN FRANCE MY LORD I BELIEVE SO
1646-121409-0009 ONE OF THEM WAS CALLED THE CHEVALIER D'ARTAGNAN AH MY LORD IF I MISTAKE NOT THE CHEVALIER D'ARTAGNAN IS LIEUTENANT OF ROYAL GUARDS BUT TAKE CARE FOR I FEAR THAT THIS MAN IS ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO THE CARDINAL
1646-121409-0010 THAT WOULD BE A MISFORTUNE SAID DE WINTER AND I SHALL BEGIN TO THINK THAT WE ARE REALLY DOOMED BUT THE OTHERS SAID THE QUEEN WHO CLUNG TO THIS LAST HOPE AS A SHIPWRECKED MAN CLINGS TO THE HULL OF HIS VESSEL THE OTHERS MY LORD
1646-121409-0011 THE SECOND I HEARD HIS NAME BY CHANCE FOR BEFORE FIGHTING US THESE FOUR GENTLEMEN TOLD US THEIR NAMES THE SECOND WAS CALLED THE COMTE DE LA FERE
1646-121409-0012 OH MON DIEU IT IS A MATTER OF THE GREATEST URGENCY TO FIND THEM OUT SAID THE QUEEN SINCE YOU THINK THESE WORTHY GENTLEMEN MIGHT BE SO USEFUL TO THE KING OH YES SAID DE WINTER FOR THEY ARE THE SAME MEN LISTEN MADAME AND RECALL YOUR REMEMBRANCES
1646-121409-0013 HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD THAT QUEEN ANNE OF AUSTRIA WAS ONCE SAVED FROM THE GREATEST DANGER EVER INCURRED BY A QUEEN YES AT THE TIME OF HER RELATIONS WITH MONSIEUR DE BUCKINGHAM IT HAD TO DO IN SOME WAY WITH CERTAIN STUDS AND DIAMONDS WELL IT WAS THAT AFFAIR MADAME
1646-121409-0014 THESE MEN ARE THE ONES WHO SAVED HER AND I SMILE WITH PITY WHEN I REFLECT THAT IF THE NAMES OF THOSE GENTLEMEN ARE UNKNOWN TO YOU IT IS BECAUSE THE QUEEN HAS FORGOTTEN THEM WHO OUGHT TO HAVE MADE THEM THE FIRST NOBLEMEN OF THE REALM
1646-121409-0015 WELL THEN MY LORD THEY MUST BE FOUND BUT WHAT CAN FOUR MEN OR RATHER THREE MEN DO FOR I TELL YOU YOU MUST NOT COUNT ON MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN IT WILL BE ONE VALIANT SWORD THE LESS BUT THERE WILL REMAIN STILL THREE WITHOUT RECKONING MY OWN
1646-121409-0016 NOW FOUR DEVOTED MEN AROUND THE KING TO PROTECT HIM FROM HIS ENEMIES TO BE AT HIS SIDE IN BATTLE TO AID HIM WITH COUNSEL TO ESCORT HIM IN FLIGHT ARE SUFFICIENT NOT TO MAKE THE KING A CONQUEROR BUT TO SAVE HIM IF CONQUERED AND WHATEVER MAZARIN MAY SAY ONCE ON THE SHORES OF FRANCE YOUR ROYAL HUSBAND
1646-121409-0017 MAY FIND AS MANY RETREATS AND ASYLUMS AS THE SEABIRD FINDS IN A STORM SEEK THEN MY LORD SEEK THESE GENTLEMEN AND IF THEY WILL CONSENT TO GO WITH YOU TO ENGLAND I WILL GIVE TO EACH A DUCHY THE DAY THAT WE REASCEND THE THRONE BESIDES AS MUCH GOLD AS WOULD PAVE WHITEHALL
1646-121409-0018 SEEK THEM MY LORD AND FIND THEM I CONJURE YOU I WILL SEARCH FOR THEM MADAME SAID DE WINTER AND DOUBTLESS I SHALL FIND THEM BUT TIME FAILS ME HAS YOUR MAJESTY FORGOTTEN THAT THE KING EXPECTS YOUR REPLY AND AWAITS IT IN AGONY
1646-121409-0019 THEN INDEED WE ARE LOST CRIED THE QUEEN IN THE FULLNESS OF A BROKEN HEART AT THIS MOMENT THE DOOR OPENED AND THE YOUNG HENRIETTA APPEARED THEN THE QUEEN WITH THAT WONDERFUL STRENGTH WHICH IS THE PRIVILEGE OF PARENTS REPRESSED HER TEARS AND MOTIONED TO DE WINTER TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT
1646-121409-0020 BUT THAT ACT OF SELF CONTROL EFFECTIVE AS IT WAS DID NOT ESCAPE THE EYES OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS SHE STOPPED ON THE THRESHOLD BREATHED A SIGH AND ADDRESSING THE QUEEN WHY THEN DO YOU ALWAYS WEEP MOTHER WHEN I AM AWAY FROM YOU SHE SAID
1646-121409-0021 THE QUEEN SMILED BUT INSTEAD OF ANSWERING SEE DE WINTER SHE SAID I HAVE AT LEAST GAINED ONE THING IN BEING ONLY HALF A QUEEN AND THAT IS THAT MY CHILDREN CALL ME MOTHER INSTEAD OF MADAME THEN TURNING TOWARD HER DAUGHTER
1646-121409-0022 MY MOTHER REPLIED THE YOUNG PRINCESS A CAVALIER HAS JUST ENTERED THE LOUVRE AND WISHES TO PRESENT HIS RESPECTS TO YOUR MAJESTY HE ARRIVES FROM THE ARMY AND HAS HE SAYS A LETTER TO REMIT TO YOU ON THE PART OF THE MARECHAL DE GRAMMONT I THINK
1646-121409-0023 AH SAID THE QUEEN TO DE WINTER HE IS ONE OF MY FAITHFUL ADHERENTS BUT DO YOU NOT OBSERVE MY DEAR LORD THAT WE ARE SO POORLY SERVED THAT IT IS LEFT TO MY DAUGHTER TO FILL THE OFFICE OF DOORKEEPER MADAME HAVE PITY ON ME EXCLAIMED DE WINTER YOU WRING MY HEART
1646-121409-0024 AND WHO IS THIS CAVALIER HENRIETTA ASKED THE QUEEN
1646-121409-0025 THE QUEEN SMILING MADE A SIGN WITH HER HEAD THE YOUNG PRINCESS OPENED THE DOOR AND RAOUL APPEARED ON THE THRESHOLD ADVANCING A FEW STEPS TOWARD THE QUEEN HE KNELT DOWN MADAME SAID HE I BEAR TO YOUR MAJESTY A LETTER FROM MY FRIEND THE COUNT DE GUICHE
1646-121409-0026 WHO TOLD ME HE HAD THE HONOR OF BEING YOUR SERVANT THIS LETTER CONTAINS IMPORTANT NEWS AND THE EXPRESSION OF HIS RESPECT AT THE NAME OF THE COUNT DE GUICHE A BLUSH SPREAD OVER THE CHEEKS OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND THE QUEEN GLANCED AT HER WITH SOME DEGREE OF SEVERITY
1646-121409-0027 YOU TOLD ME THAT THE LETTER WAS FROM THE MARECHAL DE GRAMMONT HENRIETTA SAID THE QUEEN
1646-121409-0028 IT IS MY FAULT MADAME SAID RAOUL I DID ANNOUNCE MYSELF IN TRUTH AS COMING ON THE PART OF THE MARECHAL DE GRAMMONT BUT BEING WOUNDED IN THE RIGHT ARM HE WAS UNABLE TO WRITE AND THEREFORE THE COUNT DE GUICHE ACTED AS HIS SECRETARY THERE HAS BEEN FIGHTING THEN ASKED THE QUEEN MOTIONING TO RAOUL TO RISE
1646-121409-0029 YES MADAME SAID THE YOUNG MAN AT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OF A BATTLE HAVING TAKEN PLACE THE PRINCESS OPENED HER MOUTH AS THOUGH TO ASK A QUESTION OF INTEREST BUT HER LIPS CLOSED AGAIN WITHOUT ARTICULATING A WORD WHILE THE COLOR GRADUALLY FADED FROM HER CHEEKS
1646-121409-0030 THE QUEEN SAW THIS AND DOUBTLESS HER MATERNAL HEART TRANSLATED THE EMOTION FOR ADDRESSING RAOUL AGAIN AND NO EVIL HAS HAPPENED TO THE YOUNG COUNT DE GUICHE SHE ASKED FOR NOT ONLY IS HE OUR SERVANT AS YOU SAY SIR BUT MORE HE IS ONE OF OUR FRIENDS
1646-121409-0031 NO MADAME REPLIED RAOUL ON THE CONTRARY HE GAINED GREAT GLORY AND HAD THE HONOR OF BEING EMBRACED BY HIS HIGHNESS THE PRINCE ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE THE YOUNG PRINCESS CLAPPED HER HANDS AND THEN ASHAMED OF HAVING BEEN BETRAYED INTO SUCH A DEMONSTRATION OF JOY
1646-121409-0032 SHE HALF TURNED AWAY AND BENT OVER A VASE OF ROSES AS IF TO INHALE THEIR ODOR LET US SEE SAID THE QUEEN WHAT THE COUNT SAYS AND SHE OPENED THE LETTER AND READ MADAME
1646-121409-0033 I HAVE COMMANDED MY SON THE COUNT DE GUICHE WHO WITH HIS FATHER IS EQUALLY YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT
1646-121409-0034 AND THAT THIS VICTORY CANNOT FAIL TO GIVE GREAT POWER TO CARDINAL MAZARIN AND TO THE QUEEN OVER THE AFFAIRS OF EUROPE
1646-121409-0035 IS THE FRIEND OF MY SON WHO OWES TO HIM HIS LIFE HE IS A GENTLEMAN IN WHOM YOUR MAJESTY MAY CONFIDE ENTIRELY IN CASE YOUR MAJESTY MAY HAVE SOME VERBAL OR WRITTEN ORDER TO REMIT TO ME I HAVE THE HONOR TO BE WITH RESPECT ET CETERA MARECHAL DE GRAMMONT
1646-121409-0036 AT THE MOMENT MENTION OCCURRED OF HIS HAVING RENDERED A SERVICE TO THE COUNT RAOUL COULD NOT HELP TURNING HIS GLANCE TOWARD THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND THEN HE SAW IN HER EYES AN EXPRESSION OF INFINITE GRATITUDE TO THE YOUNG MAN
1646-121409-0037 THEY CAN GAIN BATTLES YES THE MARECHAL DE GRAMMONT IS RIGHT
1646-121409-0038 IT WILL DO NOTHING FOR ENGLISH EVEN IF IT DOES NOT HARM THEM THIS IS RECENT NEWS SIR CONTINUED SHE AND I THANK YOU FOR HAVING MADE SUCH HASTE TO BRING IT TO ME WITHOUT THIS LETTER I SHOULD NOT HAVE HEARD TILL TO MORROW PERHAPS AFTER TO MORROW THE LAST OF ALL PARIS

1646-121409-0046 RAOUL BENT RESPECTFULLY BEFORE THE TWO PRINCESSES AND BOWING TO DE WINTER DEPARTED THE QUEEN AND DE WINTER CONTINUED TO CONVERSE FOR SOME TIME IN LOW VOICES IN ORDER THAT THE YOUNG PRINCESS SHOULD NOT OVERHEAR THEM
1646-121409-0047 BUT THE PRECAUTION WAS NEEDLESS SHE WAS IN DEEP CONVERSE WITH HER OWN THOUGHTS THEN WHEN DE WINTER ROSE TO TAKE LEAVE
