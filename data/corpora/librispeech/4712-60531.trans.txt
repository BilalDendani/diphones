4712-60531-0000 QUESTIONS I COULD NOT KEEP OUT OF MY WORK WHICH IT DISTRESSED ME TO TOUCH UPON IN A STUPID HAPHAZARD WAY AND WHICH NO ONE SO FAR AS I KNEW HAD HANDLED IN A MANNER TO SATISFY MY NEEDS BUT ANTICIPATIONS DID NOT ACHIEVE ITS END
4712-60531-0001 I HAVE A SLOW CONSTRUCTIVE HESITATING SORT OF MIND AND WHEN I EMERGED FROM THAT UNDERTAKING I FOUND I HAD STILL MOST OF MY QUESTIONS TO STATE AND SOLVE IN MANKIND IN THE MAKING THEREFORE
4712-60531-0002 I TRIED TO REVIEW THE SOCIAL ORGANISATION IN A DIFFERENT WAY TO CONSIDER IT AS AN EDUCATIONAL PROCESS INSTEAD OF DEALING WITH IT AS A THING WITH A FUTURE HISTORY AND IF I MADE THIS SECOND BOOK EVEN LESS SATISFACTORY FROM A LITERARY STANDPOINT THAN THE FORMER
4712-60531-0003 AND THIS IS MY OPINION I BLUNDERED I THINK MORE EDIFYINGLY AT LEAST FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF MY OWN INSTRUCTION I VENTURED UPON SEVERAL THEMES WITH A GREATER FRANKNESS THAN I HAD USED IN ANTICIPATIONS
4712-60531-0004 AND CAME OUT OF THAT SECOND EFFORT GUILTY OF MUCH RASH WRITING BUT WITH A CONSIDERABLE DEVELOPMENT OF FORMED OPINION IN MANY MATTERS I HAD SHAPED OUT AT LAST A CERTAIN PERSONAL CERTITUDE UPON WHICH I FEEL I SHALL GO FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS
4712-60531-0005 IN THIS PRESENT BOOK I HAVE TRIED TO SETTLE ACCOUNTS WITH A NUMBER OF ISSUES LEFT OVER OR OPENED UP BY ITS TWO PREDECESSORS TO CORRECT THEM IN SOME PARTICULARS AND TO GIVE THE GENERAL PICTURE OF A UTOPIA
4712-60531-0006 AT ONCE POSSIBLE AND MORE DESIRABLE THAN THE WORLD IN WHICH I LIVE BUT THIS BOOK HAS BROUGHT ME BACK TO IMAGINATIVE WRITING AGAIN IN ITS TWO PREDECESSORS THE TREATMENT OF SOCIAL ORGANISATION HAD BEEN PURELY OBJECTIVE
4712-60531-0007 HERE MY INTENTION HAS BEEN A LITTLE WIDER AND DEEPER IN THAT I HAVE TRIED TO PRESENT NOT SIMPLY AN IDEAL BUT AN IDEAL IN REACTION WITH TWO PERSONALITIES MOREOVER SINCE THIS MAY BE THE LAST BOOK OF THE KIND I SHALL EVER PUBLISH
4712-60531-0008 I HAVE WRITTEN INTO IT AS WELL AS I CAN THE HERETICAL METAPHYSICAL SCEPTICISM UPON WHICH ALL MY THINKING RESTS AND I HAVE INSERTED CERTAIN SECTIONS REFLECTING UPON THE ESTABLISHED METHODS OF SOCIOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE
4712-60531-0009 THE LAST FOUR WORDS WILL NOT ATTRACT THE BUTTERFLY READER I KNOW I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE THE WHOLE OF THIS BOOK AS LUCID AND ENTERTAINING AS ITS MATTER PERMITS BECAUSE I WANT IT READ BY AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE
4712-60531-0010 BUT I DO NOT PROMISE ANYTHING BUT RAGE AND CONFUSION TO HIM WHO PROPOSES TO GLANCE THROUGH MY PAGES JUST TO SEE IF I AGREE WITH HIM OR TO BEGIN IN THE MIDDLE OR TO READ WITHOUT A CONSTANTLY ALERT ATTENTION
4712-60531-0011 IF YOU ARE NOT ALREADY A LITTLE INTERESTED AND OPEN MINDED WITH REGARD TO SOCIAL AND POLITICAL QUESTIONS
4712-60531-0012 IF YOUR MIND IS MADE UP UPON SUCH ISSUES YOUR TIME WILL BE WASTED ON THESE PAGES AND EVEN IF YOU ARE A WILLING READER YOU MAY REQUIRE A LITTLE PATIENCE FOR THE PECULIAR METHOD I HAVE THIS TIME ADOPTED
4712-60531-0013 THAT METHOD ASSUMES AN AIR OF HAPHAZARD BUT IT IS NOT SO CARELESS AS IT SEEMS I BELIEVE IT TO BE EVEN NOW THAT I AM THROUGH WITH THE BOOK
4712-60531-0014 THE BEST WAY TO A SORT OF LUCID VAGUENESS WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY INTENTION IN THIS MATTER I TRIED OVER SEVERAL BEGINNINGS OF A UTOPIAN BOOK BEFORE I ADOPTED THIS I REJECTED FROM THE OUTSET THE FORM OF THE ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAY
4712-60531-0015 THE FORM WHICH APPEALS MOST READILY TO WHAT IS CALLED THE SERIOUS READER THE READER WHO IS OFTEN NO MORE THAN THE SOLEMNLY IMPATIENT PARASITE OF GREAT QUESTIONS HE LIKES EVERYTHING IN HARD HEAVY LINES BLACK AND WHITE YES AND NO
4712-60531-0016 BECAUSE HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THERE IS THAT CANNOT BE PRESENTED AT ALL IN THAT WAY WHEREVER THERE IS ANY EFFECT OF OBLIQUITY OF INCOMMENSURABLES WHEREVER THERE IS ANY LEVITY OR HUMOUR OR DIFFICULTY OF MULTIPLEX PRESENTATION HE REFUSES ATTENTION
4712-60531-0017 THAT THE SPIRIT OF CREATION CANNOT COUNT BEYOND TWO HE DEALS ONLY IN ALTERNATIVES SUCH READERS I HAVE RESOLVED NOT TO ATTEMPT TO PLEASE HERE EVEN IF I PRESENTED ALL MY TRI CLINIC CRYSTALS AS SYSTEMS OF CUBES
4712-60531-0018 INDEED I FELT IT WOULD NOT BE WORTH DOING BUT HAVING REJECTED THE SERIOUS ESSAY AS A FORM I WAS STILL GREATLY EXERCISED I SPENT SOME VACILLATING MONTHS OVER THE SCHEME OF THIS BOOK
4712-60531-0019 I TRIED FIRST A RECOGNISED METHOD OF VIEWING QUESTIONS FROM DIVERGENT POINTS THAT HAS ALWAYS ATTRACTED ME AND WHICH I HAVE NEVER SUCCEEDED IN USING THE DISCUSSION NOVEL AFTER THE FASHION OF PEACOCK'S AND MISTER MALLOCK'S
4712-60531-0020 DEVELOPMENT OF THE ANCIENT DIALOGUE BUT THIS ENCUMBERED ME WITH UNNECESSARY CHARACTERS AND THE INEVITABLE COMPLICATION OF INTRIGUE AMONG THEM AND I ABANDONED IT AFTER THAT I TRIED TO CAST THE THING INTO A SHAPE RESEMBLING A LITTLE
4712-60531-0021 THE DOUBLE PERSONALITY OF BOSWELL'S JOHNSON A SORT OF INTERPLAY BETWEEN MONOLOGUE AND COMMENTATOR BUT THAT TOO ALTHOUGH IT GOT NEARER TO THE QUALITY I SOUGHT FINALLY FAILED THEN I HESITATED OVER WHAT ONE MIGHT CALL HARD NARRATIVE
4712-60531-0022 IT WILL BE EVIDENT TO THE EXPERIENCED READER THAT BY OMITTING CERTAIN SPECULATIVE AND METAPHYSICAL ELEMENTS AND BY ELABORATING INCIDENT THIS BOOK MIGHT HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO A STRAIGHTFORWARD STORY
4712-60531-0023 THERE ARE WORKS AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM THAT ARE BEST BEGUN WITH A PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR AND HERE INDEED BECAUSE OF A VERY NATURAL MISUNDERSTANDING THIS IS THE ONLY COURSE TO TAKE THROUGHOUT THESE PAPERS SOUNDS A NOTE A DISTINCTIVE AND PERSONAL NOTE
4712-60531-0024 A NOTE THAT TENDS AT TIMES TOWARDS STRIDENCY AND ALL THAT IS NOT AS THESE WORDS ARE IN ITALICS IS IN ONE VOICE NOW THIS VOICE AND THIS IS THE PECULIARITY OF THE MATTER
4712-60531-0025 YOU MUST FIGURE TO YOURSELF AS A WHITISH PLUMP MAN A LITTLE UNDER THE MIDDLE SIZE AND AGE
4712-60531-0026 AGILE IN HIS MOVEMENTS AND WITH A SLIGHT TONSORIAL BALDNESS A PENNY MIGHT COVER IT OF THE CROWN HIS FRONT IS CONVEX HE DROOPS AT TIMES LIKE MOST OF US
4712-60531-0027 BUT FOR THE GREATER PART HE BEARS HIMSELF AS VALIANTLY AS A SPARROW OCCASIONALLY HIS HAND FLIES OUT WITH A FLUTTERING GESTURE OF ILLUSTRATION AND HIS VOICE WHICH IS OUR MEDIUM HENCEFORTH IS AN UNATTRACTIVE TENOR THAT BECOMES AT TIMES AGGRESSIVE
4712-60531-0028 HIM YOU MUST IMAGINE AS SITTING AT A TABLE READING A MANUSCRIPT ABOUT UTOPIAS A MANUSCRIPT HE HOLDS IN TWO HANDS THAT ARE JUST A LITTLE FAT AT THE WRIST THE CURTAIN RISES UPON HIM SO
4712-60531-0029 YOU WILL GO WITH HIM THROUGH CURIOUS AND INTERESTING EXPERIENCES YET EVER AND AGAIN YOU WILL FIND HIM BACK AT THAT LITTLE TABLE THE MANUSCRIPT IN HIS HAND AND THE EXPANSION OF HIS RATIOCINATIONS ABOUT UTOPIA CONSCIENTIOUSLY RESUMED
4712-60531-0030 THE ENTERTAINMENT BEFORE YOU IS NEITHER THE SET DRAMA OF THE WORK OF FICTION YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED TO READ NOR THE SET LECTURING OF THE ESSAY YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED TO EVADE BUT A HYBRID OF THESE TWO
4712-60531-0031 IF YOU FIGURE THIS OWNER OF THE VOICE AS SITTING A LITTLE NERVOUSLY A LITTLE MODESTLY ON A STAGE WITH TABLE GLASS OF WATER AND ALL COMPLETE
4712-60531-0032 AND MYSELF AS THE INTRUSIVE CHAIRMAN INSISTING WITH A BLAND RUTHLESSNESS UPON HIS FEW WORDS OF INTRODUCTION BEFORE HE RECEDES INTO THE WINGS AND IF FURTHERMORE YOU FIGURE
4712-60531-0033 ON WHICH MOVING PICTURES INTERMITTENTLY APPEAR
4712-60531-0034 BUT OVER AGAINST THIS WRITER HERE PRESENTED THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER EARTHLY PERSON IN THE BOOK WHO GATHERS HIMSELF TOGETHER
4712-60531-0035 THIS PERSON IS SPOKEN OF AS THE BOTANIST AND HE IS A LEANER RATHER TALLER GRAVER AND MUCH LESS GARRULOUS MAN HIS FACE IS WEAKLY HANDSOME AND DONE IN TONES OF GREY HE IS FAIRISH AND GREY EYED
4712-60531-0036 AND YOU WOULD SUSPECT HIM OF DYSPEPSIA IT IS A JUSTIFIABLE SUSPICION MEN OF THIS TYPE THE CHAIRMAN REMARKS WITH A SUDDEN INTRUSION OF EXPOSITION ARE ROMANTIC WITH A SHADOW OF MEANNESS
4712-60531-0037 THEY GET INTO MIGHTY TANGLES AND TROUBLES WITH WOMEN AND HE HAS HAD HIS TROUBLES
4712-60531-0038 FOR THAT IS THE QUALITY OF HIS TYPE HE GETS NO PERSONAL EXPRESSION IN THIS BOOK THE VOICE IS ALWAYS THAT OTHER'S
4712-60531-0039 SO MUCH BY WAY OF PORTRAITURE IS NECESSARY TO PRESENT THE EXPLORERS OF THE MODERN UTOPIA WHICH WILL UNFOLD ITSELF AS A BACKGROUND TO THESE TWO ENQUIRING FIGURES THE IMAGE OF A CINEMATOGRAPH ENTERTAINMENT
4712-60531-0040 IS THE ONE TO GRASP THERE WILL BE AN EFFECT OF THESE TWO PEOPLE GOING TO AND FRO IN FRONT OF THE CIRCLE OF A RATHER DEFECTIVE LANTERN WHICH SOMETIMES JAMS AND SOMETIMES GETS OUT OF FOCUS
4712-60531-0041 BUT WHICH DOES OCCASIONALLY SUCCEED IN DISPLAYING ON A SCREEN A MOMENTARY MOVING PICTURE OF UTOPIAN CONDITIONS
