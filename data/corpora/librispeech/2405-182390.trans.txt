2405-182390-0000 ONE THING PUZZLED PETER RABBIT AND JOHNNY CHUCK AND STRIPED CHIPMUNK A GREAT DEAL AFTER THEY HAD COME TO KNOW UNC BILLY POSSUM AND HIS FUNNY WAYS THEY HAD TALKED IT OVER AND WONDERED AND WONDERED ABOUT IT AND TRIED TO UNDERSTAND IT
2405-182390-0001 AND EVEN HAD ASKED UNC BILLY ABOUT IT UNC BILLY HAD JUST GRINNED AND SAID THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO ASK HIS MAMMY OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T DO THAT AND UNC BILLY KNEW THEY COULDN'T
2405-182390-0002 FOR UNC BILLY'S MAMMY HAD DIED LONG BEFORE HE EVEN THOUGHT OF COMING UP FROM OL VIRGINNY TO THE GREEN FOREST AND THE GREEN MEADOWS WHERE THEY LIVED HE SAID IT JUST TO TEASE THEM AND WHEN HE SAID IT HE CHUCKLED UNTIL THEY CHUCKLED TOO
2405-182390-0003 AND CAN'T FIND OUT THAT YOU MOST WANT TO FIND OUT IT WAS JUST SO WITH PETER RABBIT AND JOHNNY CHUCK AND STRIPED CHIPMUNK THE MORE THEY TALKED ABOUT IT THE MORE THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHY WAS IT THAT UNC BILLY POSSUM PLAYED DEAD
2405-182390-0004 INSTEAD OF TRYING TO RUN AWAY WHEN HE WAS SURPRISED BY HIS ENEMIES THEY ALWAYS TRIED TO RUN AWAY SO DID EVERYBODY ELSE OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE EXCEPTING UNC BILLY POSSUM THERE MUST BE A REASON SAID PETER GRAVELY
2405-182390-0005 AS HE PULLED THOUGHTFULLY AT ONE OF HIS LONG EARS OF COURSE THERE IS A REASON ASSERTED JOHNNY CHUCK CHEWING THE END OF A BLADE OF GRASS THERE'S A REASON FOR EVERYTHING ADDED STRIPED CHIPMUNK COMBING OUT THE HAIR OF HIS FUNNY LITTLE TAIL
2405-182390-0006 THEN OF COURSE GRANDFATHER FROG KNOWS IT SAID PETER OF COURSE WHY DIDN'T WE THINK OF HIM BEFORE EXCLAIMED THE OTHERS I'LL BEAT YOU TO THE SMILING POOL SHOUTED PETER OF COURSE HE DID
2405-182390-0007 FOR HIS LEGS ARE LONG AND MADE FOR RUNNING BUT STRIPED CHIPMUNK WAS NOT FAR BEHIND JOHNNY CHUCK TOOK HIS TIME FOR HE KNEW THAT HE COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH THE OTHERS BESIDES HE WAS SO FAT THAT TO RUN MADE HIM PUFF AND BLOW
2405-182390-0008 GRANDFATHER FROG SAT JUST AS USUAL ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY PAD AND HE GRINNED WHEN HE SAW WHO HIS VISITORS WERE FOR HE GUESSED RIGHT AWAY WHAT THEY HAD COME FOR CHUG A RUM
2405-182390-0009 WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO KNOW NOW HE DEMANDED BEFORE PETER COULD FAIRLY GET HIS BREATH IF YOU PLEASE GRANDFATHER FROG WE WANT TO KNOW WHY IT IS THAT UNC BILLY POSSUM PLAYS DEAD REPLIED PETER AS POLITELY AS HE KNEW HOW
2405-182390-0010 GRANDFATHER FROG CHUCKLED JUST TO FOOL PEOPLE STUPID SAID HE OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT REPLIED STRIPED CHIPMUNK BUT WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IS HOW HE EVER FOUND OUT THAT HE COULD FOOL PEOPLE THAT WAY
2405-182390-0011 AND HOW HE KNOWS THAT HE WILL FOOL THEM I SUSPECT THAT HIS MAMMY TAUGHT HIM SAID GRANDFATHER FROG WITH ANOTHER CHUCKLE WAY DOWN DEEP IN HIS THROAT BUT WHO TAUGHT HIS MAMMY PERSISTED STRIPED CHIPMUNK
2405-182390-0012 GRANDFATHER FROG SNAPPED AT A FOOLISH GREEN FLY AND WHEN IT WAS SAFELY TUCKED AWAY INSIDE HIS WHITE AND YELLOW WAISTCOAT HE TURNED ONCE MORE TO HIS THREE LITTLE VISITORS AND THERE WAS A TWINKLE IN HIS BIG GOGGLY EYES
2405-182390-0013 THAT YOU WILL HAVE A STORY AND I SUPPOSE THAT THE SOONER I TELL IT TO YOU THE SOONER YOU WILL LEAVE ME IN PEACE UNC BILLY POSSUM'S GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED WAS WAS THIS WAY BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG
2405-182390-0014 INTERRUPTED PETER GRANDFATHER FROG SCOWLED AT PETER IF I HAVE ANY MORE INTERRUPTIONS THERE WILL BE NO STORY TO DAY SAID HE SEVERELY PETER LOOKED ASHAMED
2405-182390-0015 WAS VERY MUCH AS UNC BILLY IS NOW ONLY HE WAS A LITTLE MORE SPRY AND KNEW BETTER THAN TO STUFF HIMSELF SO FULL THAT HE COULDN'T RUN HE WAS ALWAYS VERY SLY AND HE PLAYED A GREAT MANY TRICKS ON HIS NEIGHBORS
2405-182390-0016 AND SOMETIMES HE GOT THEM INTO TROUBLE BUT WHEN HE DID HE ALWAYS MANAGED TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY UNTIL THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THEIR ANGER ONE MORNING THE VERY IMP OF MISCHIEF SEEMED TO GET INTO OLD MISTER POSSUM'S HEAD
2405-182390-0017 YES SIR IT CERTAINLY DID SEEM THAT WAY AND WHEN YOU SEE MISCHIEF TROTTING ALONG THE LONE LITTLE PATH IF YOU LOOK SHARP ENOUGH YOU'LL SEE TROUBLE FOLLOWING AT HIS HEELS LIKE A SHADOW I NEVER KNEW IT TO FAIL
2405-182390-0018 IT'S JUST AS SURE AS A STOMACH ACHE IS TO FOLLOW OVEREATING JUST HERE GRANDFATHER FROG PAUSED AND LOOKED VERY HARD AT PETER RABBIT BUT PETER PRETENDED NOT TO NOTICE AND AFTER SLOWLY WINKING ONE OF HIS BIG GOGGLY EYES AT JOHNNY CHUCK
2405-182390-0019 AS I SAID BEFORE THE IMP OF MISCHIEF SEEMED TO BE IN OLD MISTER POSSUM'S HEAD THAT MORNING FOR HE BEGAN TO PLAY TRICKS ON HIS NEIGHBORS AS SOON AS THEY WERE OUT OF BED HE HID OLD KING BEAR'S BREAKFAST WHILE THE LATTER HAD HIS HEAD TURNED
2405-182390-0020 AND THEN PRETENDED THAT HE HAD JUST COME ALONG HE WAS VERY POLITE
2405-182390-0021 THEN WHENEVER OLD KING BEAR CAME NEAR THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS HIDDEN OLD MISTER POSSUM WOULD HIDE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE OLD KING BEAR WAS HUNGRY AND HE WORKED HIMSELF UP INTO A TERRIBLE RAGE
2405-182390-0022 OLD MISTER POSSUM WAS VERY SYMPATHETIC AND SEEMED TO BE DOING HIS VERY BEST TO FIND THE LOST MEAL AT LAST OLD KING BEAR TURNED HIS HEAD SUDDENLY AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF OLD MISTER POSSUM HIDING THAT BREAKFAST IN A NEW PLACE
2405-182390-0023 MY MY BUT HIS TEMPER DID BOIL OVER IT CERTAINLY DID AND IF HE COULD HAVE LAID HANDS ON OLD MISTER POSSUM THAT MINUTE IT SURELY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF HIM BUT OLD MISTER POSSUM WAS MIGHTY SPRY
2405-182390-0024 AND HE WENT OFF THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST LAUGHING FIT TO KILL HIMSELF PRETTY SOON HE MET MISTER PANTHER HE WAS VERY POLITE TO MISTER PANTHER HE TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD JUST COME FROM A CALL ON OLD KING BEAR AND HINTED THAT OLD KING BEAR WAS THEN ENJOYING A FEAST
2405-182390-0025 AND THAT THERE MIGHT BE ENOUGH FOR MISTER PANTHER IF HE HURRIED UP THERE AT ONCE NOW MISTER PANTHER WAS HUNGRY FOR HE HAD FOUND NOTHING FOR HIS BREAKFAST THAT MORNING SO HE THANKED OLD MISTER POSSUM AND HURRIED AWAY TO FIND OLD KING BEAR
2405-182390-0026 AND SHARE IN THE GOOD THINGS OLD MISTER POSSUM HAD TOLD ABOUT OLD MISTER POSSUM HIMSELF HURRIED ON CHUCKLING AS HE THOUGHT OF THE WAY MISTER PANTHER WAS LIKELY TO BE RECEIVED WITH OLD KING BEAR IN SUCH A TEMPER
2405-182390-0027 IT WAS SUCH A GOOD JOKE THAT OLD MISTER POSSUM TRIED IT ON MISTER WOLF AND MISTER FISHER AND MISTER FOX IN FACT HE HUNTED UP EVERY ONE HE COULD THINK OF AND SENT THEM TO CALL ON OLD KING BEAR AND WITHOUT REALLY TELLING THEM SO
2405-182390-0028 HE MADE EACH ONE THINK THAT HE WOULD GET A SHARE IN THAT BREAKFAST NOW THERE WASN'T ANY MORE BREAKFAST THAN OLD KING BEAR WANTED HIMSELF AND BY THE TIME MISTER PANTHER ARRIVED THERE WASN'T SO MUCH AS A CRUMB LEFT THEN ONE AFTER ANOTHER
2405-182390-0029 THE OTHERS CAME DROPPING IN EACH LICKING HIS CHOPS
2405-182390-0030 AT FIRST HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT BUT PRETTY SOON MISTER FOX DELICATELY HINTED THAT THEY HAD COME IN RESPONSE TO THE INVITATION SENT BY MISTER POSSUM
2405-182390-0031 WHEN HE SAW THEM COMING HE REALIZED THAT WHAT HE HAD THOUGHT WAS A JOKE HAD BECOME NO LONGER A LAUGHING MATTER FOR HIM HE WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO RUN SO HE SCRAMBLED UP A TREE HE QUITE FORGOT THAT MISTER PANTHER AND MISTER LYNX COULD CLIMB JUST AS FAST AS HE
2405-182390-0032 UP THE TREE AFTER HIM THEY SCRAMBLED AND HE CREPT AS FAR OUT AS HE COULD GET ON ONE OF THE BRANCHES MISTER PANTHER DIDN'T DARE GO OUT THERE SO HE JUST SHOOK THE BRANCH
2405-182390-0033 WHEN HE GOT HIS BREATH AGAIN HE STILL KEPT HIS EYES CLOSED
2405-182390-0034 PRESENTLY WHILE HE WAS WONDERING WHY THEY DIDN'T JUMP ON HIM AND TEAR HIM TO PIECES OLD KING BEAR SPOKE I GUESS MISTER POSSUM WON'T PLAY ANY MORE JOKES MISTER PANTHER SAID HE
2405-182390-0035 YOU JUST KNOCKED THE LIFE OUT OF HIM WHEN YOU SHOOK HIM OFF THAT BRANCH MISTER PANTHER CAME OVER AND SNIFFED AT MISTER POSSUM AND TURNED HIM OVER WITH ONE PAW ALL THE TIME MISTER POSSUM LAY JUST AS IF HE WERE DEAD
2405-182390-0036 BECAUSE HE WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO MOVE I DIDN'T MEAN TO KILL HIM SAID MISTER PANTHER WE CERTAINLY WILL MISS HIM
2405-182390-0037 LEAVE HIM HERE AS A WARNING TO OTHERS GROWLED OLD KING BEAR EACH IN TURN CAME UP AND SNIFFED OF MISTER POSSUM AND THEN THEY ALL WENT ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS HE WAITED LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT
2405-182390-0038 AND THEN TOOK THE SHORTEST WAY HOME WHEN HE GOT THERE AND THOUGHT IT ALL OVER HE THOUGHT THAT THE BEST JOKE OF ALL WAS THE WAY HE HAD MADE EVERYBODY THINK THAT HE WAS DEAD AND THEN A BRIGHT IDEA STRUCK HIM HE WOULD TRY THE SAME TRICK
2405-182390-0039 WHENEVER HE WAS CAUGHT SO THE NEXT TIME HE GOT IN TROUBLE INSTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY HE TRIED PLAYING DEAD IT WAS SUCH A SUCCESS THAT HE TAUGHT HIS CHILDREN HOW TO DO IT AND THEY TAUGHT THEIR CHILDREN AND SO ON DOWN TO UNC BILLY WHOM YOU KNOW
2405-182390-0040 UNC BILLY SAYS IT IS A LOT EASIER THAN RUNNING AWAY AND SAFER TOO
2405-182390-0041 NOW DON'T BOTHER ME ANY MORE FOR I WANT TO TAKE A NAP CONCLUDED GRANDFATHER FROG THANK YOU CRIED PETER RABBIT AND JOHNNY CHUCK AND STRIPED CHIPMUNK
