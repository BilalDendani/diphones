4104-181012-0000 ALL THAT COULD BE DONE BY SKILL AND CARE AND LOVE WAS DONE FOR FIRM OUR LADY MANAGER AND HEAD NURSE NEVER LEFT HIM WHEN SHE COULD BE SPARED
4104-181012-0001 AND ALL THE OTHER LADIES VIED IN ZEAL FOR THIS YOUNG SOLDIER SO THAT I COULD SCARCELY GET NEAR HIM HIS GRANDFATHER'S SAD AND EXTRAORDINARY TALE WAS CONFIRMED BY A WOUNDED PRISONER
4104-181012-0002 HAD BEEN FATAL PERHAPS TO THE CAUSE HE FOUGHT FOR OR AT LEAST TO ITS GREATEST CAPTAIN RETURNING FROM DESPERATE VICTORY THE GENERAL WRAPPED IN THE FOLDS OF NIGHT
4104-181012-0003 AND PERHAPS IN THE GLOOM OF HIS OWN STERN THOUGHTS WHILE IT SEEMED QUITE IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD BE SEEN ENCOUNTERED THE FIRE OF HIS OWN TROOPS AND THE ORDER TO FIRE WAS GIVEN BY HIS FAVORITE OFFICER
4104-181012-0004 COLONEL FIRM GUNDRY WHEN THE YOUNG MAN LEARNED THAT HE HAD DESTROYED BY A LINGERING DEATH THE CHIEF IDOL OF HIS HEART HE CALLED FOR A RIFLE
4104-181012-0005 BUT ALL REFUSED HIM KNOWING TOO WELL WHAT HIS PURPOSE WAS THEN UNDER THE TREES WITHOUT A WORD OR SIGH HE SET THE HILT OF HIS SWORD UPON THE EARTH AND THE POINT TO HIS HEART AS WELL AS HE COULD FIND IT
4104-181012-0006 THE BLADE PASSED THROUGH HIM AND THEN SNAPPED OFF BUT I CAN NOT BEAR TO SPEAK OF IT AND NOW FEW PEOPLE MIGHT SUPPOSE IT BUT THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH HE WAS MADE WILL BE CLEAR
4104-181012-0007 BUT ALSO THE PUREST SCIENTIFIC REASONING ESTABLISHED A TRUTH MORE FRANKLY ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE NEW WORLD THAN IN THE OLD ONE IT WAS PROVED THAT WITH A GOOD CONSTITUTION
4104-181012-0008 IT IS SAFER TO RECEIVE TWO WOUNDS THAN ONE EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT BE AT THE SAME TIME TAKEN FIRM HAD BEEN SHOT BY THE CAPTAIN OF MEXICAN ROBBERS AS LONG AGO RELATED
4104-181012-0009 HE WAS DREADFULLY PULLED DOWN AT THE TIME AND FEW PEOPLE COULD HAVE SURVIVED IT BUT NOW THAT STOOD HIM IN THE VERY BEST STEAD NOT ONLY AS A LESSON OF PATIENCE BUT ALSO IN THE QUESTION OF CARTILAGE
4104-181012-0010 BUT NOT BEING CERTAIN WHAT CARTILAGE IS I CAN ONLY REFER INQUIRERS TO THE NOTE BOOK OF THE HOSPITAL WHICH HAS BEEN PRINTED FOR US IT WAS ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT SHATTERED AS HE WAS AND MUST BE
4104-181012-0011 THIS BRAVE AND SINGLE MINDED WARRIOR STRUGGLED FOR THE TIME SUCCESSFULLY WITH THAT GREAT ENEMY OF THE HUMAN RACE TO WHOM THE HUMAN RACE SO LARGELY CONSIGN ONE ANOTHER AND THEMSELVES
4104-181012-0012 BUT SOME DID SAY AND EMPHATICALLY UNCLE SAM THAT COLONEL FIRM GUNDRY FOR A COLONEL HE WAS NOW NOT BY COURTESY BUT COMMISSION WOULD NEVER HAVE HELD UP HIS HEAD TO DO IT
4104-181012-0013 BUT MUST HAVE GONE ON WITH HIS RAVINGS FOR DEATH IF SOMEBODY HAD NOT ARRIVED IN THE NICK OF TIME AND CRIED OVER HIM A FEMALE SOMEBODY FROM OLD ENGLAND
4104-181012-0014 AND EVEN AFTER THAT THEY SAY THAT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE CARED TO BE A MAN AGAIN NEVER WOULD HAVE CALMED HIS CONSCIENCE WITH THE REFLECTION SO COMMONPLACE AND YET SO HIGH THAT HAVING DONE OUR BEST ACCORDING TO OUR LIGHTS
4104-181012-0015 WE MUST NOT DWELL ALWAYS ON OUR DARKNESS IF ONCE AGAIN AND FOR THE RESIDUE OF LIFE THERE HAD NOT BEEN SOME ONE TO CONSOLE HIM A CONSOLATION THAT NEED NOT HAVE
4104-181012-0016 AND IS BETTER WITHOUT PURE REASON COMING AS THAT WOULD COME FROM A QUARTER WHENCE IT IS NEVER QUITE WELCOME ENOUGH FOR ME THAT HE NEVER LAID HAND TO A WEAPON OF WAR AGAIN
4104-181012-0017 AND NEVER SHALL UNLESS OUR OWN HOME IS INVADED FOR AFTER MANY MONTHS EACH EQUAL TO A YEAR OF TEACHING AND OF HUMBLING THERE SEEMED TO BE A GOOD TIME FOR ME TO GET AWAY AND ATTEND TO MY DUTIES IN ENGLAND
4104-181012-0018 OF THESE I HAD BEEN REMINDED OFTEN BY LETTERS AND ONCE BY A MESSENGER BUT ALL MONEY MATTERS SEEMED DUST IN THE BALANCE WHERE LIFE AND DEATH WERE SWINGING BUT NOW UNCLE SAM AND HIS GRANDSON
4104-181012-0019 HAVING THEIR LOVE KNIT AFRESH BY DISASTER WERE EAGER TO START FOR THE SAW MILL AND TRUST ALL EXCEPT THEIR OWN BUSINESS TO PROVIDENCE I HAD TOLD THEM THAT WHEN THEY WENT WESTWARD
4104-181012-0020 MY TIME WOULD BE COME FOR STARTING EASTWARD AND BEING UNLIKELY TO SEE THEM AGAIN I SHOULD HOPE FOR GOOD NEWS FREQUENTLY AND THEN I GOT DEAR UNCLE SAM BY HIMSELF AND BEGGED HIM
4104-181012-0021 FOR THE SAKE OF FIRM'S HAPPINESS TO KEEP HIM AS FAR AS HE COULD FROM PENNSYLVANIA SYLVESTER AT THE SAME TIME I THOUGHT THAT
4104-181012-0022 I FORGOT HER NAME OR AT ANY RATE I TOLD HIM SO WOULD MAKE HIM A GOOD STRAIGHTFORWARD WIFE SO FAR AS ONE COULD TELL FROM HAVING SEEN HER AND THAT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SETTLED IN THEIR INFANCY
4104-181012-0023 AND IF HE WOULD LET ME KNOW WHEN IT WAS TO BE I HAD SEEN A THING IN LONDON I SHOULD LIKE TO GIVE THEM WHEN I ASKED THE SAWYER TO SEE TO THIS INSTEAD OF BEING SORRY HE SEEMED QUITE PLEASED
4104-181012-0024 AND NODDED SAGACIOUSLY AND PUT HIS HAT ON AS HE GENERALLY DID TO CALCULATE BOTH OF THEM GALS HAVE MARRIED LONG AGO HE SAID LOOKING AT ME WITH A FINE SOFT GAZE AND BAD HANDFULS THEIR MATES HAVE GOT OF THEM
4104-181012-0025 BUT WHAT MADE YOU TALK OF THEM MISSY OR
4104-181012-0026 I CAN'T TELL WHAT MADE ME THINK OF THEM HOW CAN I TELL WHY I THINK OF EVERY THING STILL IT WAS AN ODD THING FOR YOUR LADYSHIP TO SAY UNCLE SAM I AM NOBODY'S LADYSHIP
4104-181012-0027 LEAST OF ALL YOURS WHAT MAKES YOU SPEAK SO I AM YOUR OWN LITTLE WANDERING CHILD WHOSE LIFE YOU SAVED AND WHOSE FATHER YOU LOVED AND WHO LOSES ALL WHO LOVE HER EVEN FROM YOU I AM FORCED TO GO AWAY
4104-181012-0028 OH WHY IS IT ALWAYS MY FATE MY FATE HUSH SAID THE OLD MAN
4104-181012-0029 TO TALK OF FATE MY DEARIE SHOWS EITHER ONE THING OR THE OTHER THAT WE HAVE NO WILL OF OUR OWN OR ELSE THAT WE KNOW NOT HOW TO GUIDE IT I NEVER KNEW A GOOD MAN TALK OF FATE
4104-181012-0030 THE LORD IN HEAVEN IS ENOUGH FOR ME AND HE ALWAYS HATH ALLOWED ME MY OWN FREE WILL THOUGH I MAY NOT HAVE HANDLED UN CLEVERLY AND HE GIVETH YOU YOUR OWN WILL NOW MY MISSY
4104-181012-0031 AND BEING AS YOU ARE A VERY GRAND YOUNG WOMAN NOW OWNING ENGLISH LAND AND INCOME PAID IN GOLD INSTEAD OF GREENBACKS THE SAME AS OUR NUGGET SEEMS LIKELY TO MY IDEAS IT WOULD BE WRONG IF WE WAS SO MUCH AS TO ASK YOU
4104-181012-0032 AND WHAT MAKES YOU SO MYSTERIOUS I DID THINK THAT YOU KNEW ME BETTER AND I HAD A RIGHT TO HOPE SO CONCERNING OF YOURSELF ALONE IS NOT WHAT WE MUST THINK OF
4104-181012-0033 YOU MIGHT DO THIS OR YOU MIGHT DO THAT ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU WAS TOLD OR EVEN MORE ACCORDING TO WHAT WAS DENIED YOU FOR POOR HONEST PEOPLE LIKE FIRM AND ME TO DEAL WITH SUCH A CASE IS OUT OF KNOWLEDGE
4104-181012-0034 FOR US IT IS GO BY THE WILL OF THE LORD AND DEAD AGIN YOUR OWN DESIRES BUT DEAR UNCLE SAM I CRIED FEELING THAT NOW I HAD HIM UPON HIS OWN TENTERHOOKS
4104-181012-0035 YOU REBUKED ME AS SHARPLY AS LIES IN YOUR NATURE FOR DARING TO TALK ABOUT FATE JUST NOW BUT TO WHAT ELSE COMES YOUR OWN CONDUCT IF YOU ARE BOUND TO GO AGAINST YOUR OWN DESIRE IF YOU HAVE SUCH A LOT OF FREEWILL
4104-181012-0036 WHY MUST YOU DO WHAT YOU DO NOT LIKE TO DO WELL WELL PERHAPS I WAS TALKING RATHER LARGE THE WILL OF THE WORLD IS UPON US AS WELL AND WE MUST HAVE RESPECT FOR ITS SETTLEMENTS
4104-181012-0037 NOW LET ME I SAID WITH A TREMBLING WISH TO HAVE EVERY THING RIGHT AND MAIDENLY I HAVE SEEN SO MUCH HARM FROM MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND THEY ARE SO SIMPLE WHEN IT IS TOO LATE
4104-181012-0038 LET ME ASK YOU ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS UNCLE SAM YOU ALWAYS ANSWER EVERY BODY AND TO YOU A CROOKED ANSWER IS IMPOSSIBLE BUSINESS IS BUSINESS THE SAWYER SAID MY DEAR I CONTRACT ACCORDINGLY
4104-181012-0039 VERY WELL THEN IN THE FIRST PLACE WHAT DO YOU WISH TO HAVE DONE WITH ME PUTTING ASIDE ALL THE GOSSIP I MEAN OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF ME WHY TO TAKE YOU BACK TO SAW MILL WITH US
4104-181012-0040 WHERE YOU ALWAYS WAS SO NATURAL IN THE NEXT PLACE WHAT DOES YOUR GRANDSON WISH TO TAKE YOU BACK TO SAW MILL WITH HIM AND KEEP YOU THERE TILL DEATH DO YOU PART
4104-181012-0041 AND NOW UNCLE SAM WHAT DO I WISH YOU SAY WE ALL HAVE SO MUCH FREE WILL IT IS NATURAL THAT YOU SHOULD WISH MY DEAR TO GO AND BE A GREAT LADY
4104-181012-0042 THEN I FLY AGAINST NATURE AND THE FAULT IS YOURS FOR FILLING ME SO WITH MACHINERY
