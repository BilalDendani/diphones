1607-134636-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN CHARACTER OF CONSTANTINE AND HIS SONS PART TWO
1607-134636-0001 THE INHERITANCE OF THE EMPIRE SEEMED TO DEVOLVE ON THE THREE SONS OF FAUSTA WHO HAVE BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED UNDER THE NAMES OF CONSTANTINE OF CONSTANTIUS AND OF CONSTANS THESE YOUNG PRINCES WERE SUCCESSIVELY INVESTED WITH THE TITLE OF CAESAR
1607-134636-0002 AND THE DATES OF THEIR PROMOTION MAY BE REFERRED TO THE TENTH THE TWENTIETH
1607-134636-0003 MIGHT BE EXCUSED BY THE PARTIALITY OF PATERNAL AFFECTION BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVES OF THE EMPEROR WHEN HE ENDANGERED THE SAFETY BOTH OF HIS FAMILY AND OF HIS PEOPLE BY THE UNNECESSARY ELEVATION
1607-134636-0004 OF HIS TWO NEPHEWS DALMATIUS AND HANNIBALIANUS THE FORMER WAS RAISED BY THE TITLE OF CAESAR TO AN EQUALITY WITH HIS COUSINS IN FAVOR OF THE LATTER CONSTANTINE INVENTED THE NEW AND SINGULAR APPELLATION
1607-134636-0005 IN ANY AGE OF THE EMPIRE HANNIBALIANUS ALONE WAS DISTINGUISHED BY THE TITLE OF KING
1607-134636-0006 THE USE OF SUCH A TITLE
1607-134636-0007 AND THE DUTIES OF ACTIVE LIFE THOSE WHO OCCASIONALLY MENTION THE EDUCATION OR TALENTS OF CONSTANTIUS ALLOW THAT HE EXCELLED IN THE GYMNASTIC ARTS OF LEAPING AND RUNNING THAT HE WAS A DEXTEROUS ARCHER A SKILFUL HORSEMAN
1607-134636-0008 AND A MASTER OF ALL THE DIFFERENT WEAPONS USED IN THE SERVICE EITHER OF THE CAVALRY
1607-134636-0009 THOUGH NOT PERHAPS WITH EQUAL SUCCESS
1607-134636-0010 AND OF THE ROMAN JURISPRUDENCE WERE INVITED BY THE LIBERALITY OF THE EMPEROR WHO RESERVED FOR HIMSELF THE IMPORTANT TASK OF INSTRUCTING THE ROYAL YOUTHS IN THE SCIENCE OF GOVERNMENT AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF MANKIND
1607-134636-0011 BUT THE GENIUS OF CONSTANTINE HIMSELF HAD BEEN FORMED BY ADVERSITY AND EXPERIENCE
1607-134636-0012 HE HAD LEARNED TO COMMAND HIS OWN PASSIONS TO ENCOUNTER THOSE OF HIS EQUALS AND TO DEPEND FOR HIS PRESENT SAFETY AND FUTURE GREATNESS ON THE PRUDENCE AND FIRMNESS OF HIS PERSONAL CONDUCT HIS DESTINED SUCCESSORS
1607-134636-0013 IN THE IMPERIAL PURPLE INCESSANTLY SURROUNDED WITH A TRAIN OF FLATTERERS THEY PASSED THEIR YOUTH IN THE ENJOYMENT OF LUXURY AND THE EXPECTATION OF A THRONE
1607-134636-0014 APPEAR TO WEAR A SMOOTH AND UNIFORM ASPECT THE INDULGENCE OF CONSTANTINE ADMITTED THEM AT A VERY TENDER AGE TO SHARE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE EMPIRE AND THEY STUDIED THE ART OF REIGNING AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PEOPLE INTRUSTED TO THEIR CARE
1607-134636-0015 THE ANCIENT PATRIMONY OF THEIR FATHER FOR THE MORE OPULENT BUT LESS MARTIAL COUNTRIES OF THE EAST ITALY
1607-134636-0016 AND AFRICA WERE ACCUSTOMED TO REVERE CONSTANS THE THIRD OF HIS SONS AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GREAT CONSTANTINE HE FIXED DALMATIUS ON THE GOTHIC FRONTIER TO WHICH HE ANNEXED THE GOVERNMENT OF THRACE MACEDONIA AND GREECE
1607-134636-0017 AND THE PROVINCES OF PONTUS CAPPADOCIA
1607-134636-0018 WERE DESTINED TO FORM THE EXTENT OF HIS NEW KINGDOM FOR EACH OF THESE PRINCES A SUITABLE ESTABLISHMENT WAS PROVIDED A JUST PROPORTION OF GUARDS OF LEGIONS AND OF AUXILIARIES WAS ALLOTTED FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE DIGNITY AND DEFENCE
1607-134636-0019 THE MINISTERS AND GENERALS WHO WERE PLACED ABOUT THEIR PERSONS WERE SUCH AS CONSTANTINE COULD TRUST TO ASSIST AND EVEN TO CONTROL THESE YOUTHFUL SOVEREIGNS IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR DELEGATED POWER AS THEY ADVANCED IN YEARS AND EXPERIENCE
1607-134636-0020 THE LIMITS OF THEIR AUTHORITY WERE INSENSIBLY ENLARGED
1607-134636-0021 WITH THE FIGURE AND COMPLEXION OF THE ANCIENT INHABITANTS OF EUROPE ACCORDING TO THE VARIOUS ACCIDENTS OF PEACE AND WAR OF ALLIANCE OR CONQUEST
1607-134636-0022 THE PURSUIT OF GAME AND THE EXERCISES OF WAR OR RATHER OF RAPINE DIRECTED THE VAGRANT MOTIONS OF THE SARMATIANS THE MOVABLE CAMPS OR CITIES THE ORDINARY RESIDENCE OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN
1607-134636-0023 CONSISTED ONLY OF LARGE WAGONS DRAWN BY OXEN AND COVERED IN THE FORM OF TENTS THE MILITARY STRENGTH OF THE NATION WAS COMPOSED OF CAVALRY AND THE CUSTOM OF THEIR WARRIORS TO LEAD IN THEIR HAND ONE OR TWO SPARE HORSES
1607-134636-0024 ENABLED THEM TO ADVANCE AND TO RETREAT WITH A RAPID DILIGENCE WHICH SURPRISED THE SECURITY AND ELUDED THE PURSUIT
1607-134636-0025 WHICH WAS CAPABLE OF RESISTING A SWORD OR JAVELIN
1607-134636-0026 CUT INTO THIN AND POLISHED SLICES CAREFULLY LAID OVER EACH OTHER IN THE MANNER OF SCALES OR FEATHERS
1607-134636-0027 THEY WERE REDUCED TO THE NECESSITY OF EMPLOYING FISH BONES FOR THE POINTS OF THEIR WEAPONS
1607-134636-0028 THAT POISONED THE WOUNDS WHICH THEY INFLICTED IS ALONE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE THE MOST SAVAGE MANNERS SINCE A PEOPLE IMPRESSED WITH A SENSE OF HUMANITY WOULD HAVE ABHORRED SO CRUEL A PRACTICE AND A NATION SKILLED IN THE ARTS OF WAR
1607-134636-0029 THEIR SHAGGY BEARDS UNCOMBED LOCKS
1607-134636-0030 WHERE HE WAS EXPOSED ALMOST WITHOUT DEFENCE TO THE FURY OF THESE MONSTERS OF THE DESERT
1607-134636-0031 AND FROM THE ACCOUNTS OF HISTORY THERE IS SOME REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THESE SARMATIANS WERE THE JAZYGAE ONE OF THE MOST NUMEROUS AND WARLIKE TRIBES OF THE NATION THE ALLUREMENTS OF PLENTY ENGAGED THEM
1607-134636-0032 TO SEEK A PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT ON THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE SOON AFTER THE REIGN OF AUGUSTUS THEY OBLIGED THE DACIANS
1607-134636-0033 TIBISCUS TO RETIRE INTO THE HILLY COUNTRY AND TO ABANDON TO THE VICTORIOUS SARMATIANS THE FERTILE PLAINS OF THE UPPER HUNGARY
1607-134636-0034 THEY WATCHED OR SUSPENDED THE MOMENT OF ATTACK AS THEY WERE PROVOKED BY INJURIES OR APPEASED BY PRESENTS THEY GRADUALLY ACQUIRED THE SKILL OF USING MORE DANGEROUS WEAPONS AND ALTHOUGH THE SARMATIANS DID NOT ILLUSTRATE THEIR NAME BY ANY MEMORABLE EXPLOITS
1607-134636-0035 WITH A FORMIDABLE BODY OF CAVALRY
1607-134636-0036 WHO YIELDED TO THE PRESSURE OF THE GOTHIC POWER THEY SEEM TO HAVE CHOSEN A KING FROM THAT NATION
1607-134636-0037 THE GOTHIC KINGS ASPIRED TO EXTEND THEIR DOMINION FROM THE EUXINE TO THE FRONTIERS OF GERMANY
1607-134636-0038 WERE STAINED WITH THE BLOOD OF THE CONTENDING BARBARIANS AFTER SOME EXPERIENCE OF THE SUPERIOR STRENGTH AND NUMBERS OF THEIR ADVERSARIES THE SARMATIANS IMPLORED THE PROTECTION OF THE ROMAN MONARCH WHO BEHELD WITH PLEASURE THE DISCORD OF THE NATIONS
1607-134636-0039 BUT WHO WAS JUSTLY ALARMED BY THE PROGRESS OF THE GOTHIC ARMS AS SOON AS CONSTANTINE HAD DECLARED HIMSELF IN FAVOR OF THE WEAKER PARTY THE HAUGHTY ARARIC KING OF THE GOTHS INSTEAD OF EXPECTING THE ATTACK OF THE LEGIONS
1607-134636-0040 BOLDLY PASSED THE DANUBE AND SPREAD TERROR AND DEVASTATION THROUGH THE PROVINCE OF MAESIA TO OPPOSE THE INROAD OF THIS DESTROYING HOST THE AGED EMPEROR TOOK THE FIELD IN PERSON
1607-134636-0041 HE HAD THE MORTIFICATION OF SEEING HIS TROOPS FLY BEFORE AN INCONSIDERABLE DETACHMENT
