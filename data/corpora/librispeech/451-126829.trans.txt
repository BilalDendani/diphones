451-126829-0010 IN WHICH NOBLE AMBITION HE SUCCEEDED PERFECTLY

451-126829-0014 I WISH MA HAD NEVER GONE AWAY I WISH YOU'D LEAVE FELICITY ALONE DAN I WISH GIRLS HAD SOME SENSE SAID DAN WHICH BROUGHT THE ORGY OF WISHING TO AN END FOR THE TIME
451-126829-0015 A WISHING FAIRY MIGHT HAVE HAD THE TIME OF HER LIFE IN THE KING KITCHEN THAT MORNING PARTICULARLY IF SHE WERE A CYNICALLY INCLINED FAIRY
451-126829-0016 BY TEA TIME THINGS HAD BRIGHTENED UP THE RAIN HAD CEASED AND THE OLD LOW RAFTERED ROOM WAS FULL OF SUNSHINE WHICH DANCED ON THE SHINING DISHES OF THE DRESSER MADE MOSAICS ON THE FLOOR
451-126829-0017 AND FLICKERED OVER THE TABLE WHEREON A DELICIOUS MEAL WAS SPREAD FELICITY HAD PUT ON HER BLUE MUSLIN AND LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL IN IT THAT HER GOOD HUMOUR WAS QUITE RESTORED
451-126829-0018 CECILY'S HEADACHE WAS BETTER AND THE STORY GIRL REFRESHED BY AN AFTERNOON SIESTA CAME DOWN WITH SMILES AND SPARKLING EYES DAN ALONE CONTINUED TO NURSE HIS GRIEVANCES
451-126829-0019 SHE SAID I HEARD UNCLE EDWARD TELLING EVER SO MANY STORIES ABOUT HIM HE WAS CALLED TO THIS CONGREGATION AND HE LABOURED HERE LONG AND FAITHFULLY AND WAS MUCH BELOVED THOUGH HE WAS VERY ECCENTRIC WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ASKED PETER HUSH
451-126829-0020 IT JUST MEANS QUEER SAID CECILY NUDGING HIM WITH HER ELBOW A COMMON MAN WOULD BE QUEER BUT WHEN IT'S A MINISTER IT'S ECCENTRIC WHEN HE GETS VERY OLD CONTINUED THE STORY GIRL THE PRESBYTERY THOUGHT IT WAS TIME HE WAS RETIRED
451-126829-0021 HE DIDN'T THINK SO BUT THE PRESBYTERY HAD THEIR WAY BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY OF THEM TO ONE OF HIM HE WAS RETIRED AND A YOUNG MAN WAS CALLED TO CARLISLE MISTER SCOTT WENT TO LIVE IN TOWN BUT HE CAME OUT TO CARLISLE VERY OFTEN
451-126829-0022 AND VISITED ALL THE PEOPLE REGULARLY JUST THE SAME AS WHEN HE WAS THEIR MINISTER THE YOUNG MINISTER WAS A VERY GOOD YOUNG MAN
451-126829-0023 BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT THE OLD MINISTER WAS VERY ANGRY AT BEING SET ASIDE AND WOULD LIKELY GIVE HIM A SOUND DRUBBING IF HE EVER MET HIM ONE DAY THE YOUNG MINISTER WAS VISITING THE CRAWFORDS IN MARKDALE WHEN THEY SUDDENLY HEARD OLD MISTER SCOTT'S VOICE IN THE KITCHEN
451-126829-0024 THE YOUNG MINISTER TURNED PALE AS THE DEAD
451-126829-0025 BUT SHE COULDN'T GET HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND ALL SHE COULD DO WAS TO HIDE HIM IN THE CHINA CLOSET THE YOUNG MINISTER SLIPPED INTO THE CHINA CLOSET AND OLD MISTER SCOTT CAME INTO THE ROOM HE TALKED VERY NICELY AND READ AND PRAYED
451-126829-0026 THEY MADE VERY LONG PRAYERS IN THOSE DAYS YOU KNOW AND AT THE END OF HIS PRAYER HE SAID
451-126829-0027 GIVE HIM COURAGE NOT TO FEAR THE FACE OF MAN
451-126829-0028 NOBODY EVER KNEW THEY SUPPOSED HE HAD SEEN HIM THROUGH THE WINDOW BEFORE HE CAME INTO THE HOUSE
451-126829-0029 MISTER SCOTT PLANTED THE YELLOW PLUM TREE IN GRANDFATHER'S TIME SAID CECILY PEELING ONE OF THE PLUMS AND WHEN HE DID IT HE SAID IT WAS AS CHRISTIAN AN ACT AS HE EVER DID I WONDER WHAT HE MEANT I DON'T SEE ANYTHING VERY CHRISTIAN ABOUT PLANTING A TREE
451-126829-0030 I DO SAID THE STORY GIRL SAGELY WHEN NEXT WE ASSEMBLED OURSELVES TOGETHER IT WAS AFTER MILKING AND THE CARES OF THE DAY WERE DONE WITH WE FOREGATHERED IN THE BALSAM FRAGRANT AISLES OF THE FIR WOOD
451-126829-0031 AND ATE EARLY AUGUST APPLES TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THE STORY GIRL SAID WE MADE HER THINK OF THE IRISHMAN'S PIG AN IRISHMAN WHO LIVED AT MARKDALE HAD A LITTLE PIG SHE SAID AND HE GAVE IT A PAILFUL OF MUSH
451-126829-0032 THE PIG ATE THE WHOLE PAILFUL AND THEN THE IRISHMAN PUT THE PIG IN THE PAIL AND IT DIDN'T FILL MORE THAN HALF THE PAIL NOW HOW WAS THAT WHEN IT HELD A WHOLE PAILFUL OF MUSH THIS SEEMED TO BE A RATHER UNANSWERABLE KIND OF CONUNDRUM
451-126829-0033 WE DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM AS WE ROAMED THE WOOD AND DAN AND PETER ALMOST QUARRELLED OVER IT DAN MAINTAINING THAT THE THING WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND PETER BEING OF THE OPINION THAT THE MUSH WAS SOMEHOW MADE THICKER IN THE PROCESS OF BEING EATEN
451-126829-0034 AND SO TOOK UP LESS ROOM DURING THE DISCUSSION WE CAME OUT TO THE FENCE OF THE HILL PASTURE WHERE GREW THE BAD BERRY BUSHES JUST WHAT THESE BAD BERRIES WERE I CANNOT TELL WE NEVER KNEW THEIR REAL NAME
451-126829-0035 AND WE WERE FORBIDDEN TO EAT THEM BECAUSE IT WAS THOUGHT THEY MIGHT BE POISONOUS DAN PICKED A CLUSTER AND HELD IT UP DAN KING DON'T YOU DARE EAT THOSE BERRIES SAID FELICITY IN HER BOSSIEST TONE THEY'RE POISON DROP THEM RIGHT AWAY
451-126829-0036 BUT AT FELICITY'S PROHIBITION THE REBELLION WHICH HAD SMOULDERED IN HIM ALL DAY BROKE INTO SUDDEN FLAME HE WOULD SHOW HER I'LL EAT THEM IF I PLEASE FELICITY KING HE SAID IN A FURY I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE POISON LOOK HERE
451-126829-0037 DAN CRAMMED THE WHOLE BUNCH INTO HIS CAPACIOUS MOUTH AND CHEWED IT UP THEY TASTE GREAT HE SAID SMACKING AND HE ATE TWO MORE CLUSTERS REGARDLESS OF OUR HORROR STRICKEN PROTESTATIONS AND FELICITY'S PLEADINGS WE FEARED THAT DAN WOULD DROP DEAD ON THE SPOT
451-126829-0038 BUT NOTHING OCCURRED IMMEDIATELY WHEN AN HOUR HAD PASSED WE CONCLUDED THAT THE BAD BERRIES WERE NOT POISON AFTER ALL AND WE LOOKED UPON DAN AS QUITE A HERO FOR DARING TO EAT THEM
451-126829-0039 FELICITY'S SO FOND OF MAKING A FUSS OVER EVERYTHING
451-126829-0040 I NOTICED THAT DAN WAS RATHER PALE AND QUIET HE LAY DOWN ON THE KITCHEN SOFA
451-126829-0041 SHUT UP HE SAID I SHUT UP FELICITY AND CECILY WERE SETTING OUT A LUNCH IN THE PANTRY WHEN WE WERE ALL STARTLED BY A LOUD GROAN FROM THE SOFA
451-126829-0042 ALL THE DEFIANCE AND BRAVADO GONE OUT OF HIM WE ALL WENT TO PIECES EXCEPT CECILY WHO ALONE RETAINED HER PRESENCE OF MIND HAVE YOU GOT A PAIN IN YOUR STOMACH SHE DEMANDED I'VE GOT AN AWFUL PAIN HERE
451-126829-0043 IF THAT'S WHERE MY STOMACH IS MOANED DAN PUTTING HIS HAND ON A PORTION OF HIS ANATOMY CONSIDERABLY BELOW HIS STOMACH OH OH OH GO FOR UNCLE ROGER COMMANDED CECILY PALE BUT COMPOSED
451-126829-0044 FELICITY PUT ON THE KETTLE DAN I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU MUSTARD AND WARM WATER THE MUSTARD AND WARM WATER PRODUCED ITS PROPER EFFECT PROMPTLY BUT GAVE DAN NO RELIEF
451-126829-0045 UNCLE ROGER WHO HAD BEEN SUMMONED FROM HIS OWN PLACE WENT AT ONCE FOR THE DOCTOR TELLING PETER TO GO DOWN THE HILL FOR MISSUS RAY PETER WENT BUT RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY SARA ONLY MISSUS RAY AND JUDY PINEAU WERE BOTH AWAY
451-126829-0046 SARA MIGHT BETTER HAVE STAYED HOME SHE WAS OF NO USE AND COULD ONLY ADD TO THE GENERAL CONFUSION WANDERING AIMLESSLY ABOUT CRYING AND ASKING IF DAN WAS GOING TO DIE
451-126829-0047 FELICITY MIGHT CHARM THE PALATE AND THE STORY GIRL BIND CAPTIVE THE SOUL BUT WHEN PAIN AND SICKNESS WRUNG THE BROW IT WAS CECILY WHO WAS THE MINISTERING ANGEL SHE MADE THE WRITHING DAN GO TO BED
451-126829-0048 SHE MADE HIM SWALLOW EVERY AVAILABLE ANTIDOTE WHICH WAS RECOMMENDED IN THE DOCTOR'S BOOK AND SHE APPLIED HOT CLOTHS TO HIM UNTIL HER FAITHFUL LITTLE HANDS WERE HALF SCALDED OFF THERE WAS NO DOUBT DAN WAS SUFFERING INTENSE PAIN
451-126829-0049 WRINGING HER HANDS AS SHE WALKED THE KITCHEN FLOOR OH WHY DOESN'T THE DOCTOR COME I TOLD DAN THE BAD BERRIES WERE POISON BUT SURELY THEY CAN'T KILL PEOPLE ALTOGETHER PA'S COUSIN DIED OF EATING SOMETHING FORTY YEARS AGO SOBBED SARA RAY
451-126829-0050 HOLD YOUR TONGUE SAID PETER IN A FIERCE WHISPER YOU OUGHTER HAVE MORE SENSE THAN TO SAY SUCH THINGS TO THE GIRLS THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ANY WORSE SCARED THAN THEY ARE
451-126829-0051 WE HAVEN'T ANY WHISKY SAID FELICITY DISAPPROVINGLY THIS IS A TEMPERANCE HOUSE BUT RUBBING WHISKY ON THE OUTSIDE ISN'T ANY HARM ARGUED PETER IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU TAKE IT INSIDE IT IS BAD FOR YOU
451-126829-0052 WELL WE HAVEN'T ANY ANYHOW SAID FELICITY I SUPPOSE BLUEBERRY WINE WOULDN'T DO IN ITS PLACE
451-126829-0053 IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK BEFORE DAN BEGAN TO GET BETTER BUT FROM THAT TIME HE IMPROVED RAPIDLY WHEN THE DOCTOR WHO HAD BEEN AWAY FROM HOME WHEN UNCLE ROGER REACHED MARKDALE CAME AT HALF PAST TEN HE FOUND HIS PATIENT VERY WEAK AND WHITE BUT FREE FROM PAIN
451-126829-0054 TOLD HER SHE WAS A LITTLE BRICK AND HAD DONE JUST THE RIGHT THING EXAMINED SOME OF THE FATAL BERRIES AND GAVE IT AS HIS OPINION THAT THEY WERE PROBABLY POISONOUS ADMINISTERED SOME POWDERS TO DAN
451-126829-0055 MISSUS RAY NOW APPEARED LOOKING FOR SARA AND SAID SHE WOULD STAY ALL NIGHT WITH US I'LL BE MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU IF YOU WILL SAID UNCLE ROGER I FEEL A BIT SHOOK I URGED JANET AND ALEC TO GO TO HALIFAX
451-126829-0056 AND TOOK THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CHILDREN WHILE THEY WERE AWAY BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS LETTING MYSELF IN FOR IF ANYTHING HAD HAPPENED
451-126829-0057 THOUGH I BELIEVE IT'S BEYOND THE POWER OF MORTAL MAN
451-126829-0058 NOW YOU YOUNG FRY GET STRAIGHT OFF TO YOUR BEDS DAN IS OUT OF DANGER AND YOU CAN'T DO ANY MORE GOOD NOT THAT ANY OF YOU HAVE DONE MUCH EXCEPT CECILY SHE'S GOT A HEAD OF HER SHOULDERS
