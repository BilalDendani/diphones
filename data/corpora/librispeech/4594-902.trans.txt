4594-902-0000 MY COMING ON THE SCENE CERTAINLY CALMED THINGS DOWN FOR THE WHOLE FORTNIGHT THAT INTERVENED BETWEEN MY ARRIVAL AND THE GIRL'S DEPARTURE
4594-902-0001 AND IN THE INTERVAL GIVE EDWARD A HELL OF A TIME HAVING DISCOVERED WHAT HE WANTED
4594-902-0002 THAT THE GIRL SHOULD GO FIVE THOUSAND MILES AWAY AND LOVE HIM STEADFASTLY AS PEOPLE DO IN SENTIMENTAL NOVELS SHE WAS DETERMINED TO SMASH THAT ASPIRATION AND SHE REPEATED TO EDWARD IN EVERY POSSIBLE TONE THAT THE GIRL DID NOT LOVE HIM
4594-902-0003 THAT THE GIRL DETESTED HIM FOR HIS BRUTALITY HIS OVERBEARINGNESS HIS DRINKING HABITS SHE POINTED OUT THAT EDWARD IN THE GIRL'S EYES WAS ALREADY PLEDGED THREE OR FOUR DEEP
4594-902-0004 EDWARD NEVER SAID ANYTHING DID THE GIRL LOVE EDWARD OR DIDN'T SHE I DON'T KNOW
4594-902-0005 FOR HIS GOOD SOLDIERING FOR HIS SAVING LIVES AT SEA FOR THE EXCELLENT LANDLORD THAT HE WAS AND THE GOOD SPORTSMAN
4594-902-0006 WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT HE WASN'T A GOOD HUSBAND FOR THOUGH WOMEN AS I SEE THEM HAVE LITTLE OR NO FEELING OF RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS A COUNTY
4594-902-0007 THEY HAVE AN IMMENSE AND AUTOMATICALLY WORKING INSTINCT THAT ATTACHES THEM TO THE INTEREST OF WOMANHOOD
4594-902-0008 BUT I RATHER THINK THAT A WOMAN WILL ONLY DO THIS IF SHE HAS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE OTHER WOMAN HAS GIVEN HER HUSBAND A BAD TIME
4594-902-0009 PUT HIM BACK AS THE SAYING IS I DON'T ATTACH ANY PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO THESE GENERALIZATIONS OF MINE THEY MAY BE RIGHT THEY MAY BE WRONG I AM ONLY AN AGEING AMERICAN WITH VERY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE YOU MAY TAKE MY GENERALIZATIONS OR LEAVE THEM
4594-902-0010 BUT I AM PRETTY CERTAIN THAT I AM RIGHT IN THE CASE OF NANCY RUFFORD THAT SHE HAD LOVED EDWARD ASHBURNHAM VERY DEEPLY AND TENDERLY IT IS NOTHING TO THE POINT THAT SHE LET HIM HAVE IT GOOD AND STRONG AS SOON AS SHE DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO LEONORA
4594-902-0011 AND THAT HIS PUBLIC SERVICES HAD COST MORE THAN LEONORA THOUGHT THEY OUGHT TO HAVE COST NANCY WOULD BE BOUND TO LET HIM HAVE IT GOOD AND STRONG THEN SHE WOULD OWE THAT TO FEMININE PUBLIC OPINION SHE WOULD BE DRIVEN TO IT BY THE INSTINCT FOR SELF PRESERVATION
4594-902-0012 SINCE SHE MIGHT WELL IMAGINE THAT IF EDWARD HAD BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO LEONORA TO MISSUS BASIL AND TO THE MEMORIES OF THE OTHER TWO HE MIGHT BE UNFAITHFUL TO HERSELF AND NO DOUBT SHE HAD HER SHARE OF THE SEX INSTINCT THAT MAKES WOMEN BE INTOLERABLY CRUEL TO THE BELOVED PERSON
4594-902-0013 ANYHOW I DON'T KNOW WHETHER AT THIS POINT NANCY RUFFORD LOVED EDWARD ASHBURNHAM I DON'T KNOW WHETHER SHE EVEN LOVED HIM WHEN ON GETTING AT ADEN THE NEWS OF HIS SUICIDE SHE WENT MAD BECAUSE THAT MAY JUST AS WELL HAVE BEEN FOR THE SAKE OF LEONORA AS FOR THE SAKE OF EDWARD
4594-902-0014 OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN FOR THE SAKE OF BOTH OF THEM I DON'T KNOW I KNOW NOTHING I AM VERY TIRED LEONORA HELD PASSIONATELY THE DOCTRINE THAT THE GIRL DIDN'T LOVE EDWARD SHE WANTED DESPERATELY TO BELIEVE THAT
4594-902-0015 IT WAS A DOCTRINE AS NECESSARY TO HER EXISTENCE AS A BELIEF IN THE PERSONAL IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL SHE SAID THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT NANCY COULD HAVE LOVED EDWARD AFTER SHE HAD GIVEN THE GIRL HER VIEW OF EDWARD'S CAREER AND CHARACTER EDWARD ON THE OTHER HAND BELIEVED MAUNDERINGLY
4594-902-0016 THAT SOME ESSENTIAL ATTRACTIVENESS IN HIMSELF MUST HAVE MADE THE GIRL CONTINUE TO GO ON LOVING HIM TO GO ON LOVING HIM AS IT WERE IN UNDERNEATH HER OFFICIAL ASPECT OF HATRED
4594-902-0017 HE THOUGHT SHE ONLY PRETENDED TO HATE HIM IN ORDER TO SAVE HER FACE AND HE THOUGHT THAT HER QUITE ATROCIOUS TELEGRAM FROM BRINDISI WAS ONLY ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO DO THAT TO PROVE THAT SHE HAD FEELINGS CREDITABLE TO A MEMBER OF THE FEMININE COMMONWEAL
4594-902-0018 I DON'T KNOW I LEAVE IT TO YOU THERE IS ANOTHER POINT THAT WORRIES ME A GOOD DEAL IN THE ASPECTS OF THIS SAD AFFAIR LEONORA SAYS THAT IN DESIRING THAT THE GIRL SHOULD GO FIVE THOUSAND MILES AWAY AND YET CONTINUE TO LOVE HIM EDWARD WAS A MONSTER OF SELFISHNESS
4594-902-0019 HE WAS DESIRING THE RUIN OF A YOUNG LIFE EDWARD ON THE OTHER HAND PUT IT TO ME THAT SUPPOSING THAT THE GIRL'S LOVE WAS A NECESSITY TO HIS EXISTENCE AND IF HE DID NOTHING BY WORD OR BY ACTION TO KEEP NANCY'S LOVE ALIVE HE COULDN'T BE CALLED SELFISH
4594-902-0020 LEONORA REPLIED THAT SHOWED HE HAD AN ABOMINABLY SELFISH NATURE EVEN THOUGH HIS ACTIONS MIGHT BE PERFECTLY CORRECT
4594-902-0021 HE SAT STILL AND LET LEONORA TAKE AWAY HIS CHARACTER AND LET LEONORA DAMN HIM TO DEEPEST HELL WITHOUT STIRRING A FINGER I DARESAY HE WAS A FOOL I DON'T SEE WHAT OBJECT THERE WAS IN LETTING THE GIRL THINK WORSE OF HIM THAN WAS NECESSARY
4594-902-0022 STILL THERE IT IS AND THERE IT IS ALSO THAT ALL THOSE THREE PRESENTED TO THE WORLD THE SPECTACLE OF BEING THE BEST OF GOOD PEOPLE I ASSURE YOU THAT DURING MY STAY FOR THAT FORTNIGHT IN THAT FINE OLD HOUSE I NEVER SO MUCH AS NOTICED A SINGLE THING THAT COULD HAVE AFFECTED THAT GOOD OPINION
4594-902-0023 AND EVEN WHEN I LOOK BACK KNOWING THE CIRCUMSTANCES I CAN'T REMEMBER A SINGLE THING ANY OF THEM SAID THAT COULD HAVE BETRAYED THEM I CAN'T REMEMBER RIGHT UP TO THE DINNER WHEN LEONORA READ OUT THAT TELEGRAM
4594-902-0024 AND LEONORA KEPT IT UP JOLLY WELL FOR EVEN LONGER THAN THAT SHE KEPT IT UP AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED UNTIL EIGHT DAYS AFTER EDWARD'S FUNERAL IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT PARTICULAR DINNER
4594-902-0025 THE DINNER AT WHICH I RECEIVED THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT NANCY WAS GOING TO LEAVE FOR INDIA ON THE FOLLOWING DAY I ASKED LEONORA TO LET ME HAVE A WORD WITH HER SHE TOOK ME INTO HER LITTLE SITTING ROOM AND I THEN SAID
4594-902-0026 I SPARE YOU THE RECORD OF MY EMOTIONS THAT SHE WAS AWARE THAT I WISHED TO MARRY NANCY THAT SHE HAD SEEMED TO FAVOUR MY SUIT AND THAT IT APPEARED TO BE RATHER A WASTE OF MONEY UPON TICKETS AND RATHER A WASTE OF TIME UPON TRAVEL TO LET THE GIRL GO TO INDIA
4594-902-0027 IF LEONORA THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS ANY CHANCE OF HER MARRYING ME AND LEONORA I ASSURE YOU WAS THE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT BRITISH MATRON SHE SAID THAT SHE QUITE FAVOURED MY SUIT THAT SHE COULD NOT DESIRE FOR THE GIRL A BETTER HUSBAND
4594-902-0028 BUT THAT SHE CONSIDERED THAT THE GIRL OUGHT TO SEE A LITTLE MORE OF LIFE BEFORE TAKING SUCH AN IMPORTANT STEP YES LEONORA USED THE WORDS TAKING SUCH AN IMPORTANT STEP SHE WAS PERFECT
4594-902-0029 AND SETTLING DOWN THERE WITH THE GIRL THAT DIDN'T AT ALL SUIT LEONORA
4594-902-0030 STILL I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE MANAGED TO LET ME KNOW IN SOME PERIPHRASIS OR OTHER THAT I MIGHT HAVE THE GIRL IF I WOULD TAKE HER TO PHILADELPHIA OR TIMBUCTOO I LOVED NANCY VERY MUCH AND LEONORA KNEW IT HOWEVER I LEFT IT AT THAT
4594-902-0031 I LEFT IT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT NANCY WAS GOING AWAY TO INDIA ON PROBATION IT SEEMED TO ME A PERFECTLY REASONABLE ARRANGEMENT AND I AM A REASONABLE SORT OF MAN I SIMPLY SAID THAT I SHOULD FOLLOW NANCY OUT TO INDIA AFTER SIX MONTHS TIME OR SO
4594-902-0032 WELL YOU SEE I DID FOLLOW NANCY OUT TO INDIA AFTER A YEAR I MUST CONFESS TO HAVING FELT A LITTLE ANGRY WITH LEONORA FOR NOT HAVING WARNED ME EARLIER THAT THE GIRL WOULD BE GOING
4594-902-0033 I TOOK IT AS ONE OF THE QUEER NOT VERY STRAIGHT METHODS THAT ROMAN CATHOLICS SEEM TO ADOPT IN DEALING WITH MATTERS OF THIS WORLD I TOOK IT THAT LEONORA HAD BEEN AFRAID I SHOULD PROPOSE TO THE GIRL OR AT ANY RATE HAVE MADE CONSIDERABLY GREATER ADVANCES TO HER THAN I DID
4594-902-0034 IF I HAD KNOWN EARLIER THAT SHE WAS GOING AWAY SO SOON PERHAPS LEONORA WAS RIGHT PERHAPS ROMAN CATHOLICS WITH THEIR QUEER SHIFTY WAYS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT THEY ARE DEALING WITH THE QUEER SHIFTY THING THAT IS HUMAN NATURE
4594-902-0035 AND THAT WOULD HAVE PRODUCED ANOTHER COMPLICATION IT MAY HAVE BEEN JUST AS WELL
4594-902-0036 FOR EDWARD ASHBURNHAM AND HIS WIFE CALLED ME HALF THE WORLD OVER IN ORDER TO SIT ON THE BACK SEAT OF A DOG CART WHILST EDWARD DROVE THE GIRL TO THE RAILWAY STATION FROM WHICH SHE WAS TO TAKE HER DEPARTURE TO INDIA THEY WANTED I SUPPOSE TO HAVE A WITNESS OF THE CALMNESS OF THAT FUNCTION
4594-902-0037 THE GIRL'S LUGGAGE HAD BEEN ALREADY PACKED AND SENT OFF BEFORE HER BERTH ON THE STEAMER HAD BEEN TAKEN THEY HAD TIMED IT ALL SO EXACTLY THAT IT WENT LIKE CLOCKWORK THEY HAD KNOWN THE DATE UPON WHICH COLONEL RUFFORD WOULD GET EDWARD'S LETTER
4594-902-0038 AND QUITE MERCILESSLY ARRANGED BY EDWARD HIMSELF THEY GAVE COLONEL RUFFORD AS A REASON FOR TELEGRAPHING THE FACT THAT MISSUS COLONEL SOMEBODY OR OTHER WOULD BE TRAVELLING BY THAT SHIP AND THAT SHE WOULD SERVE AS AN EFFICIENT CHAPERON FOR THE GIRL
4594-902-0039 GOOD PEOPLE AFTER MY INTERVIEW WITH LEONORA
4594-902-0040 I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THE GIRL WAS AND I THOUGHT I MIND FIND HER THERE
4594-902-0041 EDWARD WAS LOUNGING IN HIS CHAIR SMOKING A CIGAR AND HE SAID NOTHING FOR QUITE FIVE MINUTES THE CANDLES GLOWED IN THE GREEN SHADES THE REFLECTIONS WERE GREEN IN THE GLASSES OF THE BOOK CASES THAT HELD GUNS AND FISHING RODS OVER THE MANTELPIECE WAS THE BROWNISH PICTURE OF THE WHITE HORSE
4594-902-0042 THOSE WERE THE QUIETEST MOMENTS THAT I HAVE EVER KNOWN THEN SUDDENLY EDWARD LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYES AND SAID LOOK HERE OLD MAN I WISH YOU WOULD DRIVE WITH NANCY AND ME TO THE STATION TOMORROW
4594-902-0043 HE LAY THERE FOR A LONG TIME LOOKING ALONG THE LINE OF HIS KNEES AT THE FLUTTERING FIRE
4594-902-0044 I AM SO DESPERATELY IN LOVE WITH NANCY RUFFORD THAT I AM DYING OF IT POOR DEVIL
4594-902-0045 THE SUN WAS QUITE BRIGHT THE WINDING ROAD BETWEEN THE HEATHER AND THE BRACKEN WAS VERY HARD I SAT ON THE BACK SEAT OF THE DOG CART NANCY WAS BESIDE EDWARD THEY TALKED ABOUT THE WAY THE COB WENT EDWARD POINTED OUT WITH THE WHIP A CLUSTER OF DEER UPON A COOMBE THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE AWAY
4594-902-0046 WE PASSED THE HOUNDS IN THE LEVEL BIT OF ROAD BESIDE THE HIGH TREES GOING INTO FORDINGBRIDGE AND EDWARD PULLED UP THE DOG CART SO THAT NANCY MIGHT SAY GOOD BYE TO THE HUNTSMAN AND CAP HIM A LAST SOVEREIGN SHE HAD RIDDEN WITH THOSE HOUNDS EVER SINCE SHE HAD BEEN THIRTEEN
4594-902-0047 THE TRAIN WAS FIVE MINUTES LATE AND THEY IMAGINED THAT THAT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS MARKET DAY AT SWINDON OR WHEREVER THE TRAIN CAME FROM THAT WAS THE SORT OF THING THEY TALKED ABOUT THE TRAIN CAME IN EDWARD FOUND HER A FIRST CLASS CARRIAGE WITH AN ELDERLY WOMAN IN IT
4594-902-0048 THE GIRL ENTERED THE CARRIAGE EDWARD CLOSED THE DOOR AND THEN SHE PUT OUT HER HAND TO SHAKE MINE THERE WAS UPON THOSE PEOPLE'S FACES NO EXPRESSION OF ANY KIND WHATEVER THE SIGNAL FOR THE TRAIN'S DEPARTURE WAS A VERY BRIGHT RED
4594-902-0049 SO LONG TO EDWARD EDWARD ANSWERED SO LONG HE SWUNG ROUND ON HIS HEEL AND LARGE SLOUCHING AND WALKING WITH A HEAVY DELIBERATE PACE HE WENT OUT OF THE STATION I FOLLOWED HIM AND GOT UP BESIDE HIM IN THE HIGH DOG CART
4594-902-0050 IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE PERFORMANCE I HAVE EVER SEEN AND AFTER THAT A HOLY PEACE LIKE THE PEACE OF GOD WHICH PASSES ALL UNDERSTANDING DESCENDED UPON BRANSHAW TELERAGH LEONORA WENT ABOUT HER DAILY DUTIES WITH A SORT OF TRIUMPHANT SMILE
4594-902-0051 A VERY FAINT SMILE BUT QUITE TRIUMPHANT I GUESS SHE HAD SO LONG SINCE GIVEN UP ANY IDEA OF GETTING HER MAN BACK
4594-902-0052 ONCE IN THE HALL WHEN LEONORA WAS GOING OUT EDWARD SAID BENEATH HIS BREATH BUT I JUST CAUGHT THE WORDS THOU HAST CONQUERED O PALE GALILEAN IT WAS LIKE HIS SENTIMENTALITY TO QUOTE SWINBURNE
4594-902-0053 IT'S VERY ODD I THINK I OUGHT TO TELL YOU DOWELL THAT I HAVEN'T ANY FEELINGS AT ALL ABOUT THE GIRL NOW IT'S ALL OVER DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT ME I'M ALL RIGHT A LONG TIME AFTERWARDS HE SAID
4594-902-0054 I GUESS IT WAS ONLY A FLASH IN THE PAN HE BEGAN TO LOOK AFTER THE ESTATES AGAIN HE TOOK ALL THAT TROUBLE OVER GETTING OFF THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER WHO HAD MURDERED HER BABY HE SHOOK HANDS SMILINGLY WITH EVERY FARMER IN THE MARKET PLACE
4594-902-0055 EVERYTHING WENT ON AS IF THE GIRL HAD NEVER EXISTED IT WAS VERY STILL WEATHER
4594-902-0056 AND WHEN I COME TO LOOK AT IT I SEE THAT IT IS A HAPPY ENDING WITH WEDDING BELLS AND ALL THE VILLAINS FOR OBVIOUSLY EDWARD AND THE GIRL WERE VILLAINS HAVE BEEN PUNISHED BY SUICIDE AND MADNESS THE HEROINE THE PERFECTLY NORMAL VIRTUOUS AND SLIGHTLY DECEITFUL HEROINE
4594-902-0057 HAS BECOME THE HAPPY WIFE OF A PERFECTLY NORMAL VIRTUOUS AND SLIGHTLY DECEITFUL HUSBAND
4594-902-0058 A HAPPY ENDING THAT IS WHAT IT WORKS OUT AT I CANNOT CONCEAL FROM MYSELF THE FACT THAT I NOW DISLIKE LEONORA WITHOUT DOUBT I AM JEALOUS OF RODNEY BAYHAM BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS MERELY A JEALOUSY ARISING FROM THE FACT THAT I DESIRED MYSELF TO POSSESS LEONORA
4594-902-0059 EDWARD ASHBURNHAM AND NANCY RUFFORD IN ORDER TO SET HER UP IN A MODERN MANSION REPLETE WITH EVERY CONVENIENCE AND DOMINATED BY A QUITE RESPECTABLE AND EMINENTLY ECONOMICAL MASTER OF THE HOUSE IT WAS NECESSARY THAT EDWARD AND NANCY RUFFORD SHOULD BECOME
4594-902-0060 FOR ME AT LEAST NO MORE THAN TRAGIC SHADES
4594-902-0061 AND SHE REPEATED THE WORD SHUTTLECOCKS THREE TIMES I KNOW WHAT WAS PASSING IN HER MIND IF SHE CAN BE SAID TO HAVE A MIND FOR LEONORA HAS TOLD ME THAT ONCE THE POOR GIRL SAID SHE FELT LIKE A SHUTTLECOCK BEING TOSSED BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS
4594-902-0062 BETWEEN THE VIOLENT PERSONALITIES OF EDWARD AND HIS WIFE LEONORA SHE SAID WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO DELIVER HER OVER TO EDWARD AND EDWARD TACITLY AND SILENTLY FORCED HER BACK AGAIN
4594-902-0063 AND LEONORA ALSO IMAGINED THAT EDWARD AND NANCY PICKED HER UP AND THREW HER DOWN AS SUITED THEIR PURELY VAGRANT MOODS SO THERE YOU HAVE THE PRETTY PICTURE MIND I AM NOT PREACHING ANYTHING CONTRARY TO ACCEPTED MORALITY
4594-902-0064 SOCIETY MUST GO ON I SUPPOSE AND SOCIETY CAN ONLY EXIST IF THE NORMAL
4594-902-0065 AND IF THE PASSIONATE THE HEADSTRONG AND THE TOO TRUTHFUL ARE CONDEMNED TO SUICIDE AND TO MADNESS BUT I GUESS THAT I MYSELF IN MY FAINTER WAY COME INTO THE CATEGORY OF THE PASSIONATE OF THE HEADSTRONG AND THE TOO TRUTHFUL
4594-902-0066 FOR I CAN'T CONCEAL FROM MYSELF THE FACT THAT I LOVED EDWARD ASHBURNHAM
4594-902-0067 IF I HAD HAD THE COURAGE AND VIRILITY AND POSSIBLY ALSO THE PHYSIQUE OF EDWARD ASHBURNHAM I SHOULD I FANCY HAVE DONE MUCH WHAT HE DID
4594-902-0068 YES SOCIETY MUST GO ON IT MUST BREED LIKE RABBITS THAT IS WHAT WE ARE HERE FOR BUT THEN I DON'T LIKE SOCIETY MUCH
4594-902-0069 NO ONE VISITS ME FOR I VISIT NO ONE
4594-902-0070 IN TWENTY MINUTES OR SO I SHALL WALK DOWN TO THE VILLAGE BENEATH MY OWN OAKS ALONGSIDE MY OWN CLUMPS OF GORSE TO GET THE AMERICAN MAIL
4594-902-0071 SO LIFE PETERS OUT I SHALL RETURN TO DINE AND NANCY WILL SIT OPPOSITE ME WITH THE OLD NURSE STANDING BEHIND HER ENIGMATIC SILENT UTTERLY WELL BEHAVED AS FAR AS HER KNIFE AND FORK GO
4594-902-0072 THEN SHE WILL SAY THAT SHE BELIEVES IN AN OMNIPOTENT DEITY OR SHE WILL UTTER THE ONE WORD SHUTTLE COCKS PERHAPS IT IS VERY EXTRAORDINARY TO SEE THE PERFECT FLUSH OF HEALTH ON HER CHEEKS TO SEE THE LUSTRE OF HER COILED BLACK HAIR THE POISE OF THE HEAD UPON THE NECK
4594-902-0073 THE GRACE OF THE WHITE HANDS AND TO THINK THAT IT ALL MEANS NOTHING
4594-902-0074 YES IT IS QUEER BUT AT ANY RATE THERE IS ALWAYS LEONORA TO CHEER YOU UP
4594-902-0075 AND THAT IS THE END OF MY STORY THE CHILD IS TO BE BROUGHT UP AS A ROMANIST IT SUDDENLY OCCURS TO ME THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN TO SAY HOW EDWARD MET HIS DEATH YOU REMEMBER THAT PEACE HAD DESCENDED UPON THE HOUSE THAT LEONORA WAS QUIETLY TRIUMPHANT
4594-902-0076 AND THAT EDWARD SAID HIS LOVE FOR THE GIRL HAD BEEN MERELY A PASSING PHASE WELL ONE AFTERNOON WE WERE IN THE STABLES TOGETHER LOOKING AT A NEW KIND OF FLOORING THAT EDWARD WAS TRYING IN A LOOSE BOX
4594-902-0077 EDWARD WAS TALKING WITH A GOOD DEAL OF ANIMATION ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF GETTING THE NUMBERS OF THE HAMPSHIRE TERRITORIALS UP TO THE PROPER STANDARD HE WAS QUITE SOBER QUITE QUIET HIS SKIN WAS CLEAR COLOURED HIS HAIR WAS GOLDEN AND PERFECTLY BRUSHED
4594-902-0078 THE LEVEL BRICK DUST RED OF HIS COMPLEXION WENT CLEAN UP TO THE RIMS OF HIS EYELIDS HIS EYES WERE PORCELAIN BLUE AND THEY REGARDED ME FRANKLY AND DIRECTLY HIS FACE WAS PERFECTLY EXPRESSIONLESS
4594-902-0079 HE STOOD WELL BACK UPON HIS LEGS AND SAID WE OUGHT TO GET THEM UP TO TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY A STABLE BOY BROUGHT HIM A TELEGRAM AND WENT AWAY HE OPENED IT NEGLIGENTLY REGARDED IT WITHOUT EMOTION AND IN COMPLETE SILENCE HANDED IT TO ME
4594-902-0080 ON THE PINKISH PAPER IN A SPRAWLED HANDWRITING I READ SAFE BRINDISI HAVING RATTLING GOOD TIME NANCY
4594-902-0081 BUT HE WAS ALSO TO THE LAST A SENTIMENTALIST WHOSE MIND WAS COMPOUNDED OF INDIFFERENT POEMS AND NOVELS HE JUST LOOKED UP TO THE ROOF OF THE STABLE AS IF HE WERE LOOKING TO HEAVEN AND WHISPERED SOMETHING THAT I DID NOT CATCH
4594-902-0082 THEY CAME OUT WITH A LITTLE NEAT PEN KNIFE QUITE A SMALL PEN KNIFE HE SAID TO ME YOU MIGHT JUST TAKE THAT WIRE TO LEONORA AND HE LOOKED AT ME WITH A DIRECT CHALLENGING BROW BEATING GLARE I GUESS HE COULD SEE IN MY EYES THAT I DIDN'T INTEND TO HINDER HIM
4594-902-0083 WHY SHOULD I HINDER HIM I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS WANTED IN THE WORLD LET HIS CONFOUNDED TENANTS HIS RIFLE ASSOCIATIONS HIS DRUNKARDS RECLAIMED AND UNRECLAIMED GET ON AS THEY LIKED NOT ALL THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THEM DESERVED
4594-902-0084 THAT THAT POOR DEVIL SHOULD GO ON SUFFERING FOR THEIR SAKES WHEN HE SAW THAT I DID NOT INTEND TO INTERFERE WITH HIM HIS EYES BECAME SOFT AND ALMOST AFFECTIONATE HE REMARKED SO LONG OLD MAN
4594-902-0085 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY I WANTED TO SAY GOD BLESS YOU
4594-902-0086 BUT I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THAT WOULD NOT BE QUITE ENGLISH GOOD FORM
