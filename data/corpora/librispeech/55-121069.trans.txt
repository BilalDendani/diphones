55-121069-0000 AND IN THE REAR OF ONE OF THE MOST IMPOSING MANSIONS IN THIS RICH NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE VARIOUS HOUSES VIE WITH EACH OTHER FOR ELEGANCE OF DESIGN AND MAGNIFICENCE OF CONSTRUCTION EXTENDED A LARGE GARDEN
55-121069-0001 WHERE THE WIDE SPREADING CHESTNUT TREES RAISED THEIR HEADS HIGH ABOVE THE WALLS IN A SOLID RAMPART AND WITH THE COMING OF EVERY SPRING SCATTERED A SHOWER OF DELICATE PINK AND WHITE BLOSSOMS
55-121069-0002 INTO THE LARGE STONE VASES THAT STOOD UPON THE TWO SQUARE PILASTERS OF A CURIOUSLY WROUGHT IRON GATE
55-121069-0003 AS THEY WAVED THEIR VARIEGATED LEAVES IN THE WIND AND CHARMED THE EYE WITH THEIR SCARLET BLOOM HAD FALLEN INTO UTTER DISUSE THE PROPRIETORS OF THE MANSION HAD MANY YEARS BEFORE THOUGHT IT BEST TO CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THE POSSESSION OF THE HOUSE ITSELF
55-121069-0004 WITH ITS THICKLY PLANTED COURT YARD OPENING INTO THE FAUBOURG SAINT HONORE AND TO THE GARDEN SHUT IN BY THIS GATE WHICH FORMERLY COMMUNICATED WITH A FINE KITCHEN GARDEN OF ABOUT AN ACRE FOR THE DEMON OF SPECULATION DREW A LINE
55-121069-0005 OR IN OTHER WORDS PROJECTED A STREET AT THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN THE STREET WAS LAID OUT A NAME WAS CHOSEN AND POSTED UP ON AN IRON PLATE BUT BEFORE CONSTRUCTION WAS BEGUN
55-121069-0006 IT OCCURRED TO THE POSSESSOR OF THE PROPERTY THAT A HANDSOME SUM MIGHT BE OBTAINED FOR THE GROUND THEN DEVOTED TO FRUITS AND VEGETABLES BY BUILDING ALONG THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED STREET AND SO MAKING IT A BRANCH OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE FAUBOURG SAINT HONORE ITSELF
55-121069-0007 ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THOROUGHFARES IN THE CITY OF PARIS IN MATTERS OF SPECULATION HOWEVER THOUGH MAN PROPOSES MONEY DISPOSES FROM SOME SUCH DIFFICULTY THE NEWLY NAMED STREET DIED ALMOST IN BIRTH
55-121069-0008 AND THE PURCHASER OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN HAVING PAID A HIGH PRICE FOR IT AND BEING QUITE UNABLE TO FIND ANY ONE WILLING TO TAKE HIS BARGAIN OFF HIS HANDS WITHOUT A CONSIDERABLE LOSS YET STILL CLINGING TO THE BELIEF THAT AT SOME FUTURE DAY HE SHOULD OBTAIN A SUM FOR IT THAT WOULD REPAY HIM
55-121069-0009 NOT ONLY FOR HIS PAST OUTLAY BUT ALSO THE INTEREST UPON THE CAPITAL LOCKED UP IN HIS NEW ACQUISITION CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH LETTING THE GROUND TEMPORARILY TO SOME MARKET GARDENERS AT A YEARLY RENTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS
55-121069-0010 AND SO AS WE HAVE SAID THE IRON GATE LEADING INTO THE KITCHEN GARDEN HAD BEEN CLOSED UP AND LEFT TO THE RUST WHICH BADE FAIR BEFORE LONG TO EAT OFF ITS HINGES WHILE TO PREVENT THE IGNOBLE GLANCES OF THE DIGGERS AND DELVERS OF THE GROUND
55-121069-0011 FROM PRESUMING TO SULLY THE ARISTOCRATIC ENCLOSURE BELONGING TO THE MANSION THE GATE HAD BEEN BOARDED UP TO A HEIGHT OF SIX FEET TRUE THE PLANKS WERE NOT SO CLOSELY ADJUSTED BUT THAT A HASTY PEEP MIGHT BE OBTAINED THROUGH THEIR INTERSTICES
55-121069-0012 BUT THE STRICT DECORUM AND RIGID PROPRIETY OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE HOUSE LEFT NO GROUNDS FOR APPREHENDING THAT ADVANTAGE WOULD BE TAKEN OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE HORTICULTURE SEEMED HOWEVER TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED IN THE DESERTED KITCHEN GARDEN
55-121069-0013 AND WHERE CABBAGES CARROTS RADISHES PEASE AND MELONS HAD ONCE FLOURISHED A SCANTY CROP OF LUCERNE ALONE BORE EVIDENCE OF ITS BEING DEEMED WORTHY OF CULTIVATION
55-121069-0014 A SMALL LOW DOOR GAVE EGRESS FROM THE WALLED SPACE WE HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING INTO THE PROJECTED STREET THE GROUND HAVING BEEN ABANDONED AS UNPRODUCTIVE BY ITS VARIOUS RENTERS
55-121069-0015 AND HAD NOW FALLEN SO COMPLETELY IN GENERAL ESTIMATION AS TO RETURN NOT EVEN THE ONE HALF PER CENT IT HAD ORIGINALLY PAID TOWARDS THE HOUSE THE CHESTNUT TREES WE HAVE BEFORE MENTIONED ROSE HIGH ABOVE THE WALL
55-121069-0016 WITHOUT IN ANY WAY AFFECTING THE GROWTH OF OTHER LUXURIANT SHRUBS AND FLOWERS THAT EAGERLY DRESSED FORWARD TO FILL UP THE VACANT SPACES AS THOUGH ASSERTING THEIR RIGHT TO ENJOY THE BOON OF LIGHT AND AIR AT ONE CORNER
55-121069-0017 WHERE THE FOLIAGE BECAME SO THICK AS ALMOST TO SHUT OUT DAY A LARGE STONE BENCH AND SUNDRY RUSTIC SEATS INDICATED THAT THIS SHELTERED SPOT WAS EITHER IN GENERAL FAVOR OR PARTICULAR USE BY SOME INHABITANT OF THE HOUSE
55-121069-0018 WHICH WAS FAINTLY DISCERNIBLE THROUGH THE DENSE MASS OF VERDURE THAT PARTIALLY CONCEALED IT THOUGH SITUATED BUT A HUNDRED PACES OFF WHOEVER HAD SELECTED THIS RETIRED PORTION OF THE GROUNDS AS THE BOUNDARY OF A WALK OR AS A PLACE FOR MEDITATION
55-121069-0019 WAS ABUNDANTLY JUSTIFIED IN THE CHOICE BY THE ABSENCE OF ALL GLARE THE COOL REFRESHING SHADE THE SCREEN IT AFFORDED FROM THE SCORCHING RAYS OF THE SUN THAT FOUND NO ENTRANCE THERE EVEN DURING THE BURNING DAYS OF HOTTEST SUMMER
55-121069-0020 THE INCESSANT AND MELODIOUS WARBLING OF BIRDS AND THE ENTIRE REMOVAL FROM EITHER THE NOISE OF THE STREET OR THE BUSTLE OF THE MANSION ON THE EVENING OF ONE OF THE WARMEST DAYS SPRING HAD YET BESTOWED ON THE INHABITANTS OF PARIS
55-121069-0021 MIGHT BE SEEN NEGLIGENTLY THROWN UPON THE STONE BENCH A BOOK A PARASOL AND A WORK BASKET FROM WHICH HUNG A PARTLY EMBROIDERED CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEF WHILE AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THESE ARTICLES WAS A YOUNG WOMAN STANDING CLOSE TO THE IRON GATE
55-121069-0022 ENDEAVORING TO DISCERN SOMETHING ON THE OTHER SIDE BY MEANS OF THE OPENINGS IN THE PLANKS THE EARNESTNESS OF HER ATTITUDE AND THE FIXED GAZE WITH WHICH SHE SEEMED TO SEEK THE OBJECT OF HER WISHES PROVING HOW MUCH HER FEELINGS WERE INTERESTED IN THE MATTER
55-121069-0023 AT THAT INSTANT THE LITTLE SIDE GATE LEADING FROM THE WASTE GROUND TO THE STREET WAS NOISELESSLY OPENED AND A TALL POWERFUL YOUNG MAN APPEARED HE WAS DRESSED IN A COMMON GRAY BLOUSE AND VELVET CAP BUT HIS CAREFULLY ARRANGED HAIR BEARD AND MUSTACHE
55-121069-0024 ALL OF THE RICHEST AND GLOSSIEST BLACK ILL ACCORDED WITH HIS PLEBEIAN ATTIRE AFTER CASTING A RAPID GLANCE AROUND HIM IN ORDER TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS UNOBSERVED HE ENTERED BY THE SMALL GATE AND
55-121069-0025 CAREFULLY CLOSING AND SECURING IT AFTER HIM PROCEEDED WITH A HURRIED STEP TOWARDS THE BARRIER AT THE SIGHT OF HIM SHE EXPECTED THOUGH PROBABLY NOT IN SUCH A COSTUME THE YOUNG WOMAN STARTED IN TERROR AND WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A HASTY RETREAT
55-121069-0026 BUT THE EYE OF LOVE HAD ALREADY SEEN EVEN THROUGH THE NARROW CHINKS OF THE WOODEN PALISADES THE MOVEMENT OF THE WHITE ROBE AND OBSERVED THE FLUTTERING OF THE BLUE SASH PRESSING HIS LIPS CLOSE TO THE PLANKS HE EXCLAIMED DON'T BE ALARMED VALENTINE IT IS I
55-121069-0027 AGAIN THE TIMID GIRL FOUND COURAGE TO RETURN TO THE GATE SAYING AS SHE DID SO AND WHY DO YOU COME SO LATE TO DAY IT IS ALMOST DINNER TIME AND I HAD TO USE NO LITTLE DIPLOMACY TO GET RID OF MY WATCHFUL MOTHER IN LAW MY TOO DEVOTED MAID AND MY TROUBLESOME BROTHER
55-121069-0028 WHO IS ALWAYS TEASING ME ABOUT COMING TO WORK AT MY EMBROIDERY WHICH I AM IN A FAIR WAY NEVER TO GET DONE SO PRAY EXCUSE YOURSELF AS WELL AS YOU CAN FOR HAVING MADE ME WAIT AND AFTER THAT TELL ME WHY I SEE YOU IN A DRESS SO SINGULAR THAT AT FIRST I DID NOT RECOGNIZE YOU
55-121069-0029 DEAREST VALENTINE SAID THE YOUNG MAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR RESPECTIVE STATIONS MAKES ME FEAR TO OFFEND YOU BY SPEAKING OF MY LOVE BUT YET I CANNOT FIND MYSELF IN YOUR PRESENCE WITHOUT LONGING TO POUR FORTH MY SOUL AND TELL YOU HOW FONDLY I ADORE YOU
55-121069-0030 IF IT BE BUT TO CARRY AWAY WITH ME THE RECOLLECTION OF SUCH SWEET MOMENTS I COULD EVEN THANK YOU FOR CHIDING ME FOR IT LEAVES ME A GLEAM OF HOPE THAT IF YOU DID NOT EXPECT ME AND THAT INDEED WOULD BE WORSE THAN VANITY TO SUPPOSE
55-121069-0031 AT LEAST I WAS IN YOUR THOUGHTS YOU ASKED ME THE CAUSE OF MY BEING LATE AND WHY I COME DISGUISED I WILL CANDIDLY EXPLAIN THE REASON OF BOTH
55-121069-0032 I HAVE CHOSEN A TRADE A TRADE OH MAXIMILIAN HOW CAN YOU JEST AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE SUCH DEEP CAUSE FOR UNEASINESS HEAVEN KEEP ME FROM JESTING WITH THAT WHICH IS FAR DEARER TO ME THAN LIFE ITSELF
55-121069-0033 BUT LISTEN TO ME VALENTINE AND I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT I BECAME WEARY OF RANGING FIELDS AND SCALING WALLS AND SERIOUSLY ALARMED AT THE IDEA SUGGESTED BY YOU THAT IF CAUGHT HOVERING ABOUT HERE YOUR FATHER WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE ME SENT TO PRISON AS A THIEF
55-121069-0034 THAT WOULD COMPROMISE THE HONOR OF THE FRENCH ARMY TO SAY NOTHING OF THE FACT THAT THE CONTINUAL PRESENCE OF A CAPTAIN OF SPAHIS IN A PLACE WHERE NO WARLIKE PROJECTS COULD BE SUPPOSED TO ACCOUNT FOR IT MIGHT WELL CREATE SURPRISE
55-121069-0035 SO I HAVE BECOME A GARDENER AND CONSEQUENTLY ADOPTED THE COSTUME OF MY CALLING WHAT EXCESSIVE NONSENSE YOU TALK MAXIMILIAN NONSENSE PRAY DO NOT CALL WHAT I CONSIDER THE WISEST ACTION OF MY LIFE BY SUCH A NAME
55-121069-0036 CONSIDER BY BECOMING A GARDENER I EFFECTUALLY SCREEN OUR MEETINGS FROM ALL SUSPICION OR DANGER I BESEECH OF YOU MAXIMILIAN TO CEASE TRIFLING AND TELL ME WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN SIMPLY
55-121069-0037 THERE IS NOTHING NOW TO PREVENT MY BUILDING MYSELF A LITTLE HUT ON MY PLANTATION AND RESIDING NOT TWENTY YARDS FROM YOU ONLY IMAGINE WHAT HAPPINESS THAT WOULD AFFORD ME I CAN SCARCELY CONTAIN MYSELF AT THE BARE IDEA
55-121069-0038 SUCH FELICITY SEEMS ABOVE ALL PRICE AS A THING IMPOSSIBLE AND UNATTAINABLE BUT WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT I PURCHASE ALL THIS DELIGHT JOY AND HAPPINESS
55-121069-0039 HENCEFORTH WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR I AM ON MY OWN GROUND AND HAVE AN UNDOUBTED RIGHT TO PLACE A LADDER AGAINST THE WALL AND TO LOOK OVER WHEN I PLEASE WITHOUT HAVING ANY APPREHENSIONS OF BEING TAKEN OFF BY THE POLICE AS A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER
55-121069-0040 CLAD IN A BLOUSE AND CAP A FAINT CRY OF MINGLED PLEASURE AND SURPRISE ESCAPED FROM THE LIPS OF VALENTINE WHO ALMOST INSTANTLY SAID IN A SADDENED TONE AS THOUGH SOME ENVIOUS CLOUD DARKENED THE JOY WHICH ILLUMINED HER HEART
55-121069-0041 ALAS NO MAXIMILIAN THIS MUST NOT BE FOR MANY REASONS WE SHOULD PRESUME TOO MUCH ON OUR OWN STRENGTH AND LIKE OTHERS PERHAPS BE LED ASTRAY BY OUR BLIND CONFIDENCE IN EACH OTHER'S PRUDENCE
55-121069-0042 HOW CAN YOU FOR AN INSTANT ENTERTAIN SO UNWORTHY A THOUGHT DEAR VALENTINE HAVE I NOT FROM THE FIRST BLESSED HOUR OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE SCHOOLED ALL MY WORDS AND ACTIONS TO YOUR SENTIMENTS AND IDEAS
55-121069-0043 AND YOU HAVE I AM SURE THE FULLEST CONFIDENCE IN MY HONOR WHEN YOU SPOKE TO ME OF EXPERIENCING A VAGUE AND INDEFINITE SENSE OF COMING DANGER I PLACED MYSELF BLINDLY AND DEVOTEDLY AT YOUR SERVICE ASKING NO OTHER REWARD THAN THE PLEASURE OF BEING USEFUL TO YOU
55-121069-0044 AND THAT YOUR FATHER WAS RESOLVED UPON COMPLETING THE MATCH
55-121069-0045 I KEPT IN THE BACKGROUND AS YOU WISHED AND WAITED NOT FOR THE DECISION OF YOUR HEART OR MY OWN
