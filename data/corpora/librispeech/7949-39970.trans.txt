7949-39970-0000 CHAPTER TEN INTEREST AND DISCIPLINE ONE THE MEANING OF THE TERMS WE HAVE ALREADY NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE IN THE ATTITUDE OF A SPECTATOR
7949-39970-0001 AND OF AN AGENT OR PARTICIPANT THE FORMER IS INDIFFERENT TO WHAT IS GOING ON ONE RESULT IS JUST AS GOOD AS ANOTHER SINCE EACH IS JUST SOMETHING TO LOOK AT THE LATTER IS BOUND UP WITH WHAT IS GOING ON
7949-39970-0002 ITS OUTCOME MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO HIM HIS FORTUNES ARE MORE OR LESS AT STAKE IN THE ISSUE OF EVENTS CONSEQUENTLY HE DOES WHATEVER HE CAN TO INFLUENCE THE DIRECTION PRESENT OCCURRENCES TAKE
7949-39970-0003 ONE IS LIKE A MAN IN A PRISON CELL WATCHING THE RAIN OUT OF THE WINDOW IT IS ALL THE SAME TO HIM THE OTHER IS LIKE A MAN WHO HAS PLANNED AN OUTING FOR THE NEXT DAY WHICH CONTINUING RAIN WILL FRUSTRATE
7949-39970-0004 HE CANNOT TO BE SURE BY HIS PRESENT REACTIONS AFFECT TO MORROW'S WEATHER BUT HE MAY TAKE SOME STEPS WHICH WILL INFLUENCE FUTURE HAPPENINGS IF ONLY TO POSTPONE THE PROPOSED PICNIC
7949-39970-0005 IF A MAN SEES A CARRIAGE COMING WHICH MAY RUN OVER HIM IF HE CANNOT STOP ITS MOVEMENT HE CAN AT LEAST GET OUT OF THE WAY IF HE FORESEES THE CONSEQUENCE IN TIME IN MANY INSTANCES HE CAN INTERVENE EVEN MORE DIRECTLY
7949-39970-0006 THE ATTITUDE OF A PARTICIPANT IN THE COURSE OF AFFAIRS IS THUS A DOUBLE ONE THERE IS SOLICITUDE ANXIETY CONCERNING FUTURE CONSEQUENCES AND A TENDENCY TO ACT TO ASSURE BETTER AND AVERT WORSE CONSEQUENCES
7949-39970-0007 THERE ARE WORDS WHICH DENOTE THIS ATTITUDE CONCERN INTEREST THESE WORDS SUGGEST THAT A PERSON IS BOUND UP WITH THE POSSIBILITIES INHERING IN OBJECTS THAT HE IS ACCORDINGLY
7949-39970-0008 ON THE LOOKOUT FOR WHAT THEY ARE LIKELY TO DO TO HIM AND THAT ON THE BASIS OF HIS EXPECTATION OR FORESIGHT HE IS EAGER TO ACT SO AS TO GIVE THINGS ONE TURN RATHER THAN ANOTHER
7949-39970-0009 INTEREST AND AIMS CONCERN AND PURPOSE ARE NECESSARILY CONNECTED SUCH WORDS AS AIM INTENT END EMPHASIZE THE RESULTS WHICH ARE WANTED
7949-39970-0010 AND STRIVEN FOR THEY TAKE FOR GRANTED THE PERSONAL ATTITUDE OF SOLICITUDE AND ATTENTIVE EAGERNESS SUCH WORDS AS INTEREST AFFECTION CONCERN MOTIVATION
7949-39970-0011 EMPHASIZE THE BEARING OF WHAT IS FORESEEN UPON THE INDIVIDUAL'S FORTUNES AND HIS ACTIVE DESIRE TO ACT TO SECURE A POSSIBLE RESULT THEY TAKE FOR GRANTED THE OBJECTIVE CHANGES
7949-39970-0012 BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS BUT ONE OF EMPHASIS THE MEANING THAT IS SHADED IN ONE SET OF WORDS IS ILLUMINATED IN THE OTHER WHAT IS ANTICIPATED IS OBJECTIVE AND IMPERSONAL TO MORROW'S RAIN
7949-39970-0013 THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING RUN OVER BUT FOR AN ACTIVE BEING A BEING WHO PARTAKES OF THE CONSEQUENCES INSTEAD OF STANDING ALOOF FROM THEM THERE IS AT THE SAME TIME A PERSONAL RESPONSE
7949-39970-0014 THE DIFFERENCE IMAGINATIVELY FORESEEN MAKES A PRESENT DIFFERENCE WHICH FINDS EXPRESSION IN SOLICITUDE AND EFFORT WHILE SUCH WORDS AS AFFECTION CONCERN AND MOTIVE INDICATE AN ATTITUDE OF PERSONAL PREFERENCE
7949-39970-0015 THEY ARE ALWAYS ATTITUDES TOWARD OBJECTS TOWARD WHAT IS FORESEEN WE MAY CALL THE PHASE OF OBJECTIVE FORESIGHT INTELLECTUAL AND THE PHASE OF PERSONAL CONCERN
7949-39970-0016 EMOTIONAL AND VOLITIONAL BUT THERE IS NO SEPARATION IN THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION SUCH A SEPARATION COULD EXIST ONLY IF THE PERSONAL ATTITUDES RAN THEIR COURSE IN A WORLD BY THEMSELVES
7949-39970-0017 BUT THEY ARE ALWAYS RESPONSES TO WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE SITUATION OF WHICH THEY ARE A PART AND THEIR SUCCESSFUL OR UNSUCCESSFUL EXPRESSION DEPENDS UPON THEIR INTERACTION WITH OTHER CHANGES
7949-39970-0018 LIFE ACTIVITIES FLOURISH AND FAIL ONLY IN CONNECTION WITH CHANGES OF THE ENVIRONMENT THEY ARE LITERALLY BOUND UP WITH THESE CHANGES OUR DESIRES EMOTIONS AND AFFECTIONS ARE BUT VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH OUR DOINGS
7949-39970-0019 ARE TIED UP WITH THE DOINGS OF THINGS AND PERSONS ABOUT US INSTEAD OF MARKING A PURELY PERSONAL OR SUBJECTIVE REALM SEPARATED FROM THE OBJECTIVE AND IMPERSONAL THEY INDICATE THE NON EXISTENCE OF SUCH A SEPARATE WORLD
7949-39970-0020 THEY AFFORD CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT CHANGES IN THINGS ARE NOT ALIEN TO THE ACTIVITIES OF A SELF AND THAT THE CAREER AND WELFARE OF THE SELF ARE BOUND UP WITH THE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS AND THINGS INTEREST CONCERN
7949-39970-0021 MEAN THAT SELF AND WORLD ARE ENGAGED WITH EACH OTHER IN A DEVELOPING SITUATION THE WORD INTEREST IN ITS ORDINARY USAGE
7949-39970-0022 THE WHOLE STATE OF ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
7949-39970-0023 THE OBJECTIVE RESULTS THAT ARE FORESEEN AND WANTED
7949-39970-0024 THE PERSONAL EMOTIONAL INCLINATION
7949-39970-0025 AN OCCUPATION EMPLOYMENT PURSUIT BUSINESS IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS AN INTEREST THUS WE SAY THAT A MAN'S INTEREST IS POLITICS OR JOURNALISM OR PHILANTHROPY OR ARCHAEOLOGY
7949-39970-0026 OR COLLECTING JAPANESE PRINTS OR BANKING
7949-39970-0027 THE POINT WHERE IT INFLUENCES HIM IN SOME LEGAL TRANSACTIONS A MAN HAS TO PROVE INTEREST IN ORDER TO HAVE A STANDING AT COURT HE HAS TO SHOW THAT SOME PROPOSED STEP CONCERNS HIS AFFAIRS
7949-39970-0028 A SILENT PARTNER HAS AN INTEREST IN A BUSINESS ALTHOUGH HE TAKES NO ACTIVE PART IN ITS CONDUCT BECAUSE ITS PROSPERITY OR DECLINE AFFECTS HIS PROFITS AND LIABILITIES
7949-39970-0029 WHEN WE SPEAK OF A MAN AS INTERESTED IN THIS OR THAT THE EMPHASIS FALLS DIRECTLY UPON HIS PERSONAL ATTITUDE TO BE INTERESTED IS TO BE ABSORBED IN WRAPPED UP IN CARRIED AWAY BY SOME OBJECT
7949-39970-0030 TO TAKE AN INTEREST IS TO BE ON THE ALERT TO CARE ABOUT TO BE ATTENTIVE WE SAY OF AN INTERESTED PERSON BOTH THAT HE HAS LOST HIMSELF IN SOME AFFAIR AND THAT HE HAS FOUND HIMSELF IN IT BOTH TERMS EXPRESS THE ENGROSSMENT OF THE SELF
7949-39970-0031 IN AN OBJECT WHEN THE PLACE OF INTEREST IN EDUCATION IS SPOKEN OF IN A DEPRECIATORY WAY IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THE SECOND OF THE MEANINGS MENTIONED IS FIRST EXAGGERATED AND THEN ISOLATED
7949-39970-0032 INTEREST IS TAKEN TO MEAN MERELY THE EFFECT OF AN OBJECT UPON PERSONAL ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE SUCCESS OR FAILURE SEPARATED FROM ANY OBJECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFAIRS THESE ARE REDUCED TO MERE PERSONAL STATES OF PLEASURE OR PAIN
7949-39970-0033 EDUCATIONALLY IT THEN FOLLOWS THAT TO ATTACH IMPORTANCE TO INTEREST MEANS TO ATTACH SOME FEATURE OF SEDUCTIVENESS TO MATERIAL OTHERWISE INDIFFERENT TO SECURE ATTENTION AND EFFORT BY OFFERING A BRIBE
7949-39970-0034 OF PLEASURE THIS PROCEDURE IS PROPERLY STIGMATIZED AS SOFT PEDAGOGY AS A SOUP KITCHEN THEORY OF EDUCATION BUT THE OBJECTION IS BASED UPON THE FACT OR ASSUMPTION
7949-39970-0035 THAT THE FORMS OF SKILL TO BE ACQUIRED AND THE SUBJECT MATTER TO BE APPROPRIATED HAVE NO INTEREST ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT IN OTHER WORDS THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IRRELEVANT TO THE NORMAL ACTIVITIES OF THE PUPILS
7949-39970-0036 THE REMEDY IS NOT IN FINDING FAULT WITH THE DOCTRINE OF INTEREST ANY MORE THAN IT IS TO SEARCH FOR SOME PLEASANT BAIT THAT MAY BE HITCHED TO THE ALIEN MATERIAL IT IS TO DISCOVER OBJECTS AND MODES OF ACTION
7949-39970-0037 WHICH ARE CONNECTED WITH PRESENT POWERS THE FUNCTION OF THIS MATERIAL IN ENGAGING ACTIVITY AND CARRYING IT ON CONSISTENTLY AND CONTINUOUSLY IS ITS INTEREST IF THE MATERIAL OPERATES IN THIS WAY THERE IS NO CALL EITHER TO HUNT FOR DEVICES WHICH WILL MAKE IT INTERESTING
7949-39970-0038 OR TO APPEAL TO ARBITRARY SEMI COERCED EFFORT THE WORD INTEREST SUGGESTS ETYMOLOGICALLY WHAT IS BETWEEN THAT WHICH CONNECTS TWO THINGS OTHERWISE DISTANT IN EDUCATION THE DISTANCE COVERED MAY BE LOOKED AT AS TEMPORAL
7949-39970-0039 THE FACT THAT A PROCESS TAKES TIME TO MATURE IS SO OBVIOUS A FACT THAT WE RARELY MAKE IT EXPLICIT WE OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT IN GROWTH THERE IS GROUND TO BE COVERED BETWEEN AN INITIAL STAGE OF PROCESS AND THE COMPLETING PERIOD
7949-39970-0040 THAT THERE IS SOMETHING INTERVENING IN LEARNING THE PRESENT POWERS OF THE PUPIL ARE THE INITIAL STAGE THE AIM OF THE TEACHER REPRESENTS THE REMOTE LIMIT BETWEEN THE TWO LIE MEANS
7949-39970-0041 THAT IS MIDDLE CONDITIONS ACTS TO BE PERFORMED DIFFICULTIES TO BE OVERCOME APPLIANCES TO BE USED ONLY THROUGH THEM IN THE LITERAL TIME SENSE WILL THE INITIAL ACTIVITIES REACH A SATISFACTORY CONSUMMATION
7949-39970-0042 THESE INTERMEDIATE CONDITIONS ARE OF INTEREST PRECISELY BECAUSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXISTING ACTIVITIES INTO THE FORESEEN AND DESIRED END DEPENDS UPON THEM TO BE MEANS FOR THE ACHIEVING OF PRESENT TENDENCIES
7949-39970-0043 TO BE BETWEEN THE AGENT AND HIS END TO BE OF INTEREST ARE DIFFERENT NAMES FOR THE SAME THING WHEN MATERIAL HAS TO BE MADE INTERESTING IT SIGNIFIES THAT AS PRESENTED IT LACKS CONNECTION WITH PURPOSES AND PRESENT POWER
7949-39970-0044 TO MAKE IT INTERESTING BY LEADING ONE TO REALIZE THE CONNECTION THAT EXISTS IS SIMPLY GOOD SENSE TO MAKE IT INTERESTING BY EXTRANEOUS AND ARTIFICIAL INDUCEMENTS DESERVES ALL THE BAD NAMES WHICH HAVE BEEN APPLIED TO THE DOCTRINE OF INTEREST IN EDUCATION
7949-39970-0045 SO MUCH FOR THE MEANING OF THE TERM INTEREST NOW FOR THAT OF DISCIPLINE WHERE AN ACTIVITY TAKES TIME
7949-39970-0046 WHERE MANY MEANS AND OBSTACLES LIE BETWEEN ITS INITIATION AND COMPLETION DELIBERATION AND PERSISTENCE ARE REQUIRED IT IS OBVIOUS THAT A VERY LARGE PART OF THE EVERYDAY MEANING OF WILL IS PRECISELY THE DELIBERATE OR CONSCIOUS
7949-39970-0047 DISPOSITION TO PERSIST AND ENDURE IN A PLANNED COURSE OF ACTION IN SPITE OF DIFFICULTIES AND CONTRARY SOLICITATIONS A MAN OF STRONG WILL IN THE POPULAR USAGE OF THE WORDS
7949-39970-0048 IS A MAN WHO IS NEITHER FICKLE NOR HALF HEARTED IN ACHIEVING CHOSEN ENDS HIS ABILITY IS EXECUTIVE THAT IS HE PERSISTENTLY AND ENERGETICALLY STRIVES TO EXECUTE OR CARRY OUT HIS AIMS
7949-39970-0049 CLEARLY THERE ARE TWO FACTORS IN WILL
7949-39970-0050 OF RESULTS THE OTHER WITH THE DEPTH OF HOLD THE FORESEEN OUTCOME HAS UPON THE PERSON
7949-39970-0051 OBSTINACY IS PERSISTENCE BUT IT IS NOT STRENGTH OF VOLITION OBSTINACY MAY BE MERE ANIMAL INERTIA AND INSENSITIVENESS
7949-39970-0052 A MAN KEEPS ON DOING A THING JUST BECAUSE HE HAS GOT STARTED NOT BECAUSE OF ANY CLEARLY THOUGHT OUT PURPOSE IN FACT THE OBSTINATE MAN GENERALLY DECLINES ALTHOUGH HE MAY NOT BE QUITE AWARE OF HIS REFUSAL
7949-39970-0053 TO MAKE CLEAR TO HIMSELF WHAT HIS PROPOSED END IS HE HAS A FEELING THAT IF HE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO GET A CLEAR AND FULL IDEA OF IT IT MIGHT NOT BE WORTH WHILE
7949-39970-0054 STUBBORNNESS SHOWS ITSELF EVEN MORE IN RELUCTANCE TO CRITICIZE ENDS WHICH PRESENT THEMSELVES THAN IT DOES IN
7949-39970-0055 PERSISTENCE AND ENERGY IN USE OF MEANS TO ACHIEVE THE END THE REALLY EXECUTIVE MAN IS A MAN WHO PONDERS HIS ENDS WHO MAKES HIS IDEAS OF THE RESULTS OF HIS ACTIONS AS CLEAR AND FULL AS POSSIBLE
7949-39970-0056 THE PEOPLE WE CALLED WEAK WILLED OR SELF INDULGENT ALWAYS DECEIVE THEMSELVES AS TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTS THEY PICK OUT SOME FEATURE WHICH IS AGREEABLE AND NEGLECT ALL ATTENDANT CIRCUMSTANCES
7949-39970-0057 WHEN THEY BEGIN TO ACT THE DISAGREEABLE RESULTS THEY IGNORED BEGIN TO SHOW THEMSELVES
7949-39970-0058 AND SHIFT TO SOME OTHER LINE OF ACTION THAT THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRONG AND FEEBLE VOLITION IS INTELLECTUAL
7949-39970-0059 CONSISTING IN THE DEGREE OF PERSISTENT FIRMNESS AND FULLNESS WITH WHICH CONSEQUENCES ARE THOUGHT OUT CANNOT BE OVER EMPHASIZED
7949-39970-0060 THERE IS OF COURSE SUCH A THING AS A SPECULATIVE TRACING OUT OF RESULTS ENDS ARE THEN FORESEEN BUT THEY DO NOT LAY DEEP HOLD OF A PERSON THEY ARE SOMETHING TO LOOK AT AND FOR CURIOSITY TO PLAY WITH RATHER THAN SOMETHING TO ACHIEVE
7949-39970-0061 THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS OVER INTELLECTUALITY BUT THERE IS SUCH A THING AS A ONE SIDED INTELLECTUALITY A PERSON TAKES IT OUT AS WE SAY IN CONSIDERING THE CONSEQUENCES OF PROPOSED LINES OF ACTION
7949-39970-0062 A CERTAIN FLABBINESS OF FIBER PREVENTS THE CONTEMPLATED OBJECT FROM GRIPPING HIM AND ENGAGING HIM IN ACTION AND MOST PERSONS ARE NATURALLY DIVERTED FROM A PROPOSED COURSE OF ACTION BY UNUSUAL UNFORESEEN OBSTACLES
7949-39970-0063 OR BY PRESENTATION OF INDUCEMENTS TO AN ACTION THAT IS DIRECTLY MORE AGREEABLE A PERSON WHO IS TRAINED TO CONSIDER HIS ACTIONS TO UNDERTAKE THEM DELIBERATELY IS IN SO FAR FORTH DISCIPLINED
7949-39970-0064 ADD TO THIS ABILITY A POWER TO ENDURE IN AN INTELLIGENTLY CHOSEN COURSE IN FACE OF DISTRACTION CONFUSION AND DIFFICULTY AND YOU HAVE THE ESSENCE OF DISCIPLINE DISCIPLINE MEANS POWER AT COMMAND
7949-39970-0065 MASTERY OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR CARRYING THROUGH THE ACTION UNDERTAKEN TO KNOW WHAT ONE IS TO DO
7949-39970-0066 AND TO MOVE TO DO IT PROMPTLY AND BY USE OF THE REQUISITE MEANS IS TO BE DISCIPLINED WHETHER WE ARE THINKING OF AN ARMY OR A MIND DISCIPLINE IS POSITIVE TO COW THE SPIRIT
7949-39970-0067 TO SUBDUE INCLINATION TO COMPEL OBEDIENCE TO MORTIFY THE FLESH TO MAKE A SUBORDINATE PERFORM AN UNCONGENIAL TASK THESE THINGS ARE OR ARE NOT DISCIPLINARY ACCORDING AS THEY DO OR DO NOT
7949-39970-0068 TEND TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF POWER TO RECOGNIZE WHAT ONE IS ABOUT AND TO PERSISTENCE IN ACCOMPLISHMENT
7949-39970-0069 THAT INTEREST AND DISCIPLINE ARE CONNECTED NOT OPPOSED
7949-39970-0070 EVEN THE MORE PURELY INTELLECTUAL PHASE OF TRAINED POWER APPREHENSION OF WHAT ONE IS DOING AS EXHIBITED IN CONSEQUENCES IS NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT INTEREST
7949-39970-0071 DELIBERATION WILL BE PERFUNCTORY AND SUPERFICIAL WHERE THERE IS NO INTEREST PARENTS AND TEACHERS OFTEN COMPLAIN AND CORRECTLY THAT CHILDREN DO NOT WANT TO HEAR OR WANT TO UNDERSTAND
7949-39970-0072 THEIR MINDS ARE NOT UPON THE SUBJECT PRECISELY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT TOUCH THEM IT DOES NOT ENTER INTO THEIR CONCERNS THIS IS A STATE OF THINGS THAT NEEDS TO BE REMEDIED BUT THE REMEDY IS NOT IN THE USE OF METHODS WHICH INCREASE INDIFFERENCE AND AVERSION
7949-39970-0073 EVEN PUNISHING A CHILD FOR INATTENTION IS ONE WAY OF TRYING TO MAKE HIM REALIZE THAT THE MATTER IS NOT A THING OF COMPLETE UNCONCERN IT IS ONE WAY OF AROUSING INTEREST OR BRINGING ABOUT A SENSE OF CONNECTION
7949-39970-0074 IN THE LONG RUN ITS VALUE IS MEASURED BY WHETHER IT SUPPLIES A MERE PHYSICAL EXCITATION TO ACT IN THE WAY DESIRED BY THE ADULT OR WHETHER IT LEADS THE CHILD TO THINK THAT IS TO REFLECT UPON HIS ACTS AND IMPREGNATE THEM WITH AIMS
7949-39970-0075 THAT INTEREST IS REQUISITE FOR EXECUTIVE PERSISTENCE IS EVEN MORE OBVIOUS EMPLOYERS DO NOT ADVERTISE FOR WORKMEN WHO ARE NOT INTERESTED IN WHAT THEY ARE DOING
7949-39970-0076 WOULD STICK TO HIS WORK MORE CONSCIENTIOUSLY IF IT WAS SO UNCONGENIAL TO HIM THAT HE DID IT MERELY FROM A SENSE OF OBLIGATION INTEREST MEASURES OR RATHER IS THE DEPTH OF THE GRIP
7949-39970-0077 WHICH THE FORESEEN END HAS UPON ONE MOVING ONE TO ACT FOR ITS REALIZATION
7949-39970-0078 THE IMPORTANCE OF THE IDEA OF INTEREST IN EDUCATION INTEREST REPRESENTS THE MOVING FORCE OF OBJECTS WHETHER PERCEIVED OR PRESENTED IN IMAGINATION IN ANY EXPERIENCE HAVING A PURPOSE
7949-39970-0079 IN THE CONCRETE THE VALUE OF RECOGNIZING THE DYNAMIC PLACE OF INTEREST IN AN EDUCATIVE DEVELOPMENT IS THAT IT LEADS TO CONSIDERING INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN IN THEIR SPECIFIC CAPABILITIES NEEDS AND PREFERENCES
7949-39970-0080 ONE WHO RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF INTEREST WILL NOT ASSUME THAT ALL MINDS WORK IN THE SAME WAY BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN TO HAVE THE SAME TEACHER AND TEXTBOOK ATTITUDES AND METHODS OF APPROACH AND RESPONSE VARY WITH THE SPECIFIC APPEAL THE SAME MATERIAL MAKES
7949-39970-0081 THIS APPEAL ITSELF VARYING WITH DIFFERENCE OF NATURAL APTITUDE OF PAST EXPERIENCE OF PLAN OF LIFE AND SO ON BUT THE FACTS OF INTEREST ALSO SUPPLY CONSIDERATIONS OF GENERAL VALUE TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
7949-39970-0082 RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD THEY PUT US ON OUR GUARD AGAINST CERTAIN CONCEPTIONS OF MIND AND OF SUBJECT MATTER WHICH HAVE HAD GREAT VOGUE IN PHILOSOPHIC THOUGHT IN THE PAST AND WHICH EXERCISE A SERIOUS HAMPERING INFLUENCE UPON THE CONDUCT OF INSTRUCTION AND DISCIPLINE
7949-39970-0083 TOO FREQUENTLY MIND IS SET OVER THE WORLD OF THINGS AND FACTS TO BE KNOWN IT IS REGARDED AS SOMETHING EXISTING IN ISOLATION WITH MENTAL STATES AND OPERATIONS THAT EXIST INDEPENDENTLY
7949-39970-0084 KNOWLEDGE IS THEN REGARDED AS AN EXTERNAL APPLICATION OF PURELY MENTAL EXISTENCES TO THE THINGS TO BE KNOWN OR ELSE AS A RESULT OF THE IMPRESSIONS WHICH THIS OUTSIDE SUBJECT MATTER MAKES ON MIND
7949-39970-0085 OR AS A COMBINATION OF THE TWO SUBJECT MATTER IS THEN REGARDED AS SOMETHING COMPLETE IN ITSELF IT IS JUST SOMETHING TO BE LEARNED OR KNOWN EITHER BY THE VOLUNTARY APPLICATION OF MIND TO IT OR THROUGH THE IMPRESSIONS IT MAKES ON MIND
7949-39970-0086 THE FACTS OF INTEREST SHOW THAT THESE CONCEPTIONS ARE MYTHICAL MIND APPEARS IN EXPERIENCE AS ABILITY TO RESPOND TO PRESENT STIMULI ON THE BASIS OF ANTICIPATION OF FUTURE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES AND WITH A VIEW
7949-39970-0087 TO CONTROLLING THE KIND OF CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE TO TAKE PLACE THE THINGS THE SUBJECT MATTER KNOWN CONSIST OF WHATEVER IS RECOGNIZED AS HAVING A BEARING UPON THE ANTICIPATED COURSE OF EVENTS WHETHER ASSISTING OR RETARDING IT
7949-39970-0088 THESE STATEMENTS ARE TOO FORMAL TO BE VERY INTELLIGIBLE AN ILLUSTRATION MAY CLEAR UP THEIR SIGNIFICANCE YOU ARE ENGAGED IN A CERTAIN OCCUPATION SAY WRITING WITH A TYPEWRITER IF YOU ARE AN EXPERT
7949-39970-0089 YOUR FORMED HABITS TAKE CARE OF THE PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS AND LEAVE YOUR THOUGHTS FREE TO CONSIDER YOUR TOPIC SUPPOSE HOWEVER YOU ARE NOT SKILLED OR THAT EVEN IF YOU ARE THE MACHINE DOES NOT WORK WELL YOU THEN HAVE TO USE INTELLIGENCE
7949-39970-0090 YOU DO NOT WISH TO STRIKE THE KEYS AT RANDOM AND LET THE CONSEQUENCES BE WHAT THEY MAY YOU WISH TO RECORD CERTAIN WORDS IN A GIVEN ORDER SO AS TO MAKE SENSE YOU ATTEND TO THE KEYS TO WHAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN TO YOUR MOVEMENTS TO THE RIBBON OR THE MECHANISM OF THE MACHINE
7949-39970-0091 YOUR ATTENTION IS NOT DISTRIBUTED INDIFFERENTLY AND MISCELLANEOUSLY TO ANY AND EVERY DETAIL IT IS CENTERED UPON WHATEVER HAS A BEARING UPON THE EFFECTIVE PURSUIT OF YOUR OCCUPATION YOUR LOOK IS AHEAD
7949-39970-0092 AND YOU ARE CONCERNED TO NOTE THE EXISTING FACTS BECAUSE AND IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE FACTORS IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE RESULT INTENDED YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT YOUR RESOURCES ARE WHAT CONDITIONS ARE AT COMMAND AND WHAT THE DIFFICULTIES AND OBSTACLES ARE
7949-39970-0093 THIS FORESIGHT AND THIS SURVEY WITH REFERENCE TO WHAT IS FORESEEN CONSTITUTE MIND ACTION THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE SUCH A FORECAST OF RESULTS AND SUCH AN EXAMINATION OF MEANS AND HINDRANCES IS EITHER
7949-39970-0094 A MATTER OF HABIT OR ELSE IT IS BLIND IN NEITHER CASE IS IT INTELLIGENT TO BE VAGUE AND UNCERTAIN AS TO WHAT IS INTENDED AND CARELESS IN OBSERVATION OF CONDITIONS OF ITS REALIZATION
7949-39970-0095 IS TO BE IN THAT DEGREE STUPID OR PARTIALLY INTELLIGENT IF WE RECUR TO THE CASE WHERE MIND IS NOT CONCERNED WITH THE PHYSICAL MANIPULATION OF THE INSTRUMENTS BUT WITH
7949-39970-0096 WHAT ONE INTENDS TO WRITE THE CASE IS THE SAME THERE IS AN ACTIVITY IN PROCESS ONE IS TAKEN UP WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A THEME
7949-39970-0097 UNLESS ONE WRITES AS A PHONOGRAPH TALKS THIS MEANS INTELLIGENCE NAMELY ALERTNESS IN FORESEEING THE VARIOUS CONCLUSIONS TO WHICH PRESENT DATA AND CONSIDERATIONS ARE TENDING
7949-39970-0098 OF THE SUBJECT MATTER WHICH BEARS UPON THE CONCLUSIONS TO BE REACHED THE WHOLE ATTITUDE IS ONE OF CONCERN WITH WHAT IS TO BE AND WITH WHAT IS SO FAR AS THE LATTER ENTERS INTO THE MOVEMENT TOWARD THE END
7949-39970-0099 LEAVE OUT THE DIRECTION WHICH DEPENDS UPON FORESIGHT OF POSSIBLE FUTURE RESULTS AND THERE IS NO INTELLIGENCE IN PRESENT BEHAVIOR LET THERE BE IMAGINATIVE FORECAST BUT NO ATTENTION TO THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH ITS ATTAINMENT DEPENDS
7949-39970-0100 AND THERE IS SELF DECEPTION OR IDLE DREAMING ABORTIVE INTELLIGENCE IF THIS ILLUSTRATION IS TYPICAL MIND IS NOT A NAME FOR SOMETHING COMPLETE BY ITSELF IT IS A NAME FOR A COURSE OF ACTION IN SO FAR AS THAT IS INTELLIGENTLY DIRECTED
7949-39970-0101 IN SO FAR THAT IS TO SAY AS AIMS ENDS ENTER INTO IT WITH SELECTION OF MEANS TO FURTHER THE ATTAINMENT OF AIMS
