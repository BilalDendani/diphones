242-122627-0000 CHAPTER TWO I RESISTED ALL THE WAY A NEW THING FOR ME AND A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH GREATLY STRENGTHENED THE BAD OPINION BESSIE AND MISS ABBOT WERE DISPOSED TO ENTERTAIN OF ME THE FACT IS I WAS A TRIFLE BESIDE MYSELF
242-122627-0001 OR RATHER OUT OF MYSELF AS THE FRENCH WOULD SAY I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT A MOMENT'S MUTINY HAD ALREADY RENDERED ME LIABLE TO STRANGE PENALTIES AND LIKE ANY OTHER REBEL SLAVE I FELT RESOLVED IN MY DESPERATION TO GO ALL LENGTHS
242-122627-0002 CRIED THE LADY'S MAID WHAT SHOCKING CONDUCT MISS EYRE TO STRIKE A YOUNG GENTLEMAN YOUR BENEFACTRESS'S SON YOUR YOUNG MASTER MASTER HOW IS HE MY MASTER AM I A SERVANT
242-122627-0003 NO YOU ARE LESS THAN A SERVANT FOR YOU DO NOTHING FOR YOUR KEEP THERE SIT DOWN AND THINK OVER YOUR WICKEDNESS THEY HAD GOT ME BY THIS TIME INTO THE APARTMENT INDICATED BY MISSUS REED AND HAD THRUST ME UPON A STOOL
242-122627-0004 THEIR TWO PAIR OF HANDS ARRESTED ME INSTANTLY IF YOU DON'T SIT STILL YOU MUST BE TIED DOWN SAID BESSIE
242-122627-0005 BUT IT WAS ALWAYS IN HER WAS THE REPLY I'VE TOLD MISSIS OFTEN MY OPINION ABOUT THE CHILD
242-122627-0006 BESSIE ANSWERED NOT BUT ERE LONG ADDRESSING ME SHE SAID YOU OUGHT TO BE AWARE MISS THAT YOU ARE UNDER OBLIGATIONS TO MISSUS REED SHE KEEPS YOU
242-122627-0007 I HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO THESE WORDS THEY WERE NOT NEW TO ME MY VERY FIRST RECOLLECTIONS OF EXISTENCE INCLUDED HINTS OF THE SAME KIND THIS REPROACH OF MY DEPENDENCE HAD BECOME A VAGUE SING SONG IN MY EAR
242-122627-0008 VERY PAINFUL AND CRUSHING BUT ONLY HALF INTELLIGIBLE MISS ABBOT JOINED IN
242-122627-0009 ADDED BESSIE IN NO HARSH VOICE YOU SHOULD TRY TO BE USEFUL AND PLEASANT THEN PERHAPS YOU WOULD HAVE A HOME HERE BUT IF YOU BECOME PASSIONATE AND RUDE MISSIS WILL SEND YOU AWAY I AM SURE BESIDES SAID MISS ABBOT
242-122627-0010 SOMETHING BAD MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND FETCH YOU AWAY THEY WENT SHUTTING THE DOOR AND LOCKING IT BEHIND THEM THE RED ROOM WAS A SQUARE CHAMBER VERY SELDOM SLEPT IN
242-122627-0011 I MIGHT SAY NEVER INDEED UNLESS WHEN A CHANCE INFLUX OF VISITORS AT GATESHEAD HALL RENDERED IT NECESSARY TO TURN TO ACCOUNT ALL THE ACCOMMODATION IT CONTAINED YET IT WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND STATELIEST CHAMBERS IN THE MANSION
242-122627-0012 A BED SUPPORTED ON MASSIVE PILLARS OF MAHOGANY
242-122627-0013 STOOD OUT LIKE A TABERNACLE IN THE CENTRE THE TWO LARGE WINDOWS WITH THEIR BLINDS ALWAYS DRAWN DOWN WERE HALF SHROUDED IN FESTOONS AND FALLS OF SIMILAR DRAPERY THE CARPET WAS RED THE TABLE AT THE FOOT OF THE BED WAS COVERED WITH A CRIMSON CLOTH
242-122627-0014 THE WARDROBE THE TOILET TABLE THE CHAIRS WERE OF DARKLY POLISHED OLD MAHOGANY
242-122627-0015 THE PILED UP MATTRESSES AND PILLOWS OF THE BED
242-122627-0016 SCARCELY LESS PROMINENT WAS AN AMPLE CUSHIONED EASY CHAIR NEAR THE HEAD OF THE BED ALSO WHITE WITH A FOOTSTOOL BEFORE IT AND LOOKING AS I THOUGHT LIKE A PALE THRONE THIS ROOM WAS CHILL BECAUSE IT SELDOM HAD A FIRE
242-122627-0017 IT WAS SILENT BECAUSE REMOTE FROM THE NURSERY AND KITCHEN SOLEMN BECAUSE IT WAS KNOWN TO BE SO SELDOM ENTERED THE HOUSE MAID ALONE CAME HERE ON SATURDAYS TO WIPE FROM THE MIRRORS AND THE FURNITURE A WEEK'S QUIET DUST
242-122627-0018 AND IN THOSE LAST WORDS LIES THE SECRET OF THE RED ROOM THE SPELL WHICH KEPT IT SO LONELY IN SPITE OF ITS GRANDEUR MISTER REED HAD BEEN DEAD NINE YEARS IT WAS IN THIS CHAMBER HE BREATHED HIS LAST
242-122627-0019 WITH SUBDUED BROKEN REFLECTIONS VARYING THE GLOSS OF ITS PANELS TO MY LEFT WERE THE MUFFLED WINDOWS A GREAT LOOKING GLASS BETWEEN THEM REPEATED THE VACANT MAJESTY OF THE BED AND ROOM I WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER THEY HAD LOCKED THE DOOR
242-122627-0020 AND WHEN I DARED MOVE I GOT UP AND WENT TO SEE ALAS YES NO JAIL WAS EVER MORE SECURE RETURNING I HAD TO CROSS BEFORE THE LOOKING GLASS MY FASCINATED GLANCE INVOLUNTARILY EXPLORED THE DEPTH IT REVEALED
242-122627-0021 ALL LOOKED COLDER AND DARKER IN THAT VISIONARY HOLLOW THAN IN REALITY AND THE STRANGE LITTLE FIGURE THERE GAZING AT ME WITH A WHITE FACE AND ARMS SPECKING THE GLOOM
242-122627-0022 AND APPEARING BEFORE THE EYES OF BELATED TRAVELLERS I RETURNED TO MY STOOL SUPERSTITION WAS WITH ME AT THAT MOMENT BUT IT WAS NOT YET HER HOUR FOR COMPLETE VICTORY MY BLOOD WAS STILL WARM
242-122627-0023 ALL HIS MOTHER'S AVERSION ALL THE SERVANTS PARTIALITY TURNED UP IN MY DISTURBED MIND LIKE A DARK DEPOSIT IN A TURBID WELL WHY WAS I ALWAYS SUFFERING ALWAYS BROWBEATEN
242-122627-0024 ALWAYS ACCUSED FOR EVER CONDEMNED WHY COULD I NEVER PLEASE
242-122627-0025 ELIZA WHO WAS HEADSTRONG AND SELFISH WAS RESPECTED GEORGIANA WHO HAD A SPOILED TEMPER A VERY ACRID SPITE
242-122627-0026 WAS UNIVERSALLY INDULGED HER BEAUTY HER PINK CHEEKS AND GOLDEN CURLS SEEMED TO GIVE DELIGHT TO ALL WHO LOOKED AT HER AND TO PURCHASE INDEMNITY FOR EVERY FAULT JOHN NO ONE THWARTED MUCH LESS PUNISHED
242-122627-0027 HE CALLED HIS MOTHER OLD GIRL TOO SOMETIMES REVILED HER FOR HER DARK SKIN SIMILAR TO HIS OWN BLUNTLY DISREGARDED HER WISHES NOT UNFREQUENTLY TORE AND SPOILED HER SILK ATTIRE
242-122627-0028 AND HE WAS STILL HER OWN DARLING I DARED COMMIT NO FAULT
242-122627-0029 MY HEAD STILL ACHED AND BLED WITH THE BLOW AND FALL I HAD RECEIVED NO ONE HAD REPROVED JOHN FOR WANTONLY STRIKING ME AND BECAUSE I HAD TURNED AGAINST HIM TO AVERT FARTHER IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE
242-122627-0030 I WAS LOADED WITH GENERAL OPPROBRIUM UNJUST UNJUST SAID MY REASON FORCED BY THE AGONISING STIMULUS INTO PRECOCIOUS THOUGH TRANSITORY POWER AND RESOLVE EQUALLY WROUGHT UP
242-122627-0031 AS RUNNING AWAY OR IF THAT COULD NOT BE EFFECTED NEVER EATING OR DRINKING MORE AND LETTING MYSELF DIE WHAT A CONSTERNATION OF SOUL WAS MINE THAT DREARY AFTERNOON
242-122627-0032 A NOXIOUS THING CHERISHING THE GERMS OF INDIGNATION AT THEIR TREATMENT OF CONTEMPT OF THEIR JUDGMENT I KNOW THAT HAD I BEEN A SANGUINE BRILLIANT CARELESS EXACTING HANDSOME ROMPING CHILD THOUGH EQUALLY DEPENDENT AND FRIENDLESS
242-122627-0033 DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO FORSAKE THE RED ROOM IT WAS PAST FOUR O'CLOCK AND THE BECLOUDED AFTERNOON WAS TENDING TO DREAR TWILIGHT I HEARD THE RAIN STILL BEATING CONTINUOUSLY ON THE STAIRCASE WINDOW AND THE WIND HOWLING IN THE GROVE BEHIND THE HALL
242-122627-0034 AND THEN MY COURAGE SANK MY HABITUAL MOOD OF HUMILIATION SELF DOUBT
242-122627-0035 ALL SAID I WAS WICKED AND PERHAPS I MIGHT BE SO
242-122627-0036 THAT CERTAINLY WAS A CRIME AND WAS I FIT TO DIE OR WAS THE VAULT UNDER THE CHANCEL OF GATESHEAD CHURCH AN INVITING BOURNE IN SUCH VAULT I HAD BEEN TOLD DID MISTER REED LIE BURIED AND LED BY THIS THOUGHT TO RECALL HIS IDEA
242-122627-0037 I DWELT ON IT WITH GATHERING DREAD I COULD NOT REMEMBER HIM BUT I KNEW THAT HE WAS MY OWN UNCLE
242-122627-0038 A SINGULAR NOTION DAWNED UPON ME I DOUBTED NOT NEVER DOUBTED THAT IF MISTER REED HAD BEEN ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE TREATED ME KINDLY
242-122627-0039 I BEGAN TO RECALL WHAT I HAD HEARD OF DEAD MEN TROUBLED IN THEIR GRAVES BY THE VIOLATION OF THEIR LAST WISHES REVISITING THE EARTH TO PUNISH THE PERJURED AND AVENGE THE OPPRESSED
242-122627-0040 AND I THOUGHT MISTER REED'S SPIRIT HARASSED BY THE WRONGS OF HIS SISTER'S CHILD MIGHT QUIT ITS ABODE WHETHER IN THE CHURCH VAULT OR IN THE UNKNOWN WORLD OF THE DEPARTED AND RISE BEFORE ME IN THIS CHAMBER
242-122627-0041 I WIPED MY TEARS AND HUSHED MY SOBS FEARFUL LEST ANY SIGN OF VIOLENT GRIEF MIGHT WAKEN A PRETERNATURAL VOICE TO COMFORT ME OR ELICIT FROM THE GLOOM SOME HALOED FACE BENDING OVER ME WITH STRANGE PITY
242-122627-0042 AT THIS MOMENT A LIGHT GLEAMED ON THE WALL WAS IT I ASKED MYSELF A RAY FROM THE MOON PENETRATING SOME APERTURE IN THE BLIND NO MOONLIGHT WAS STILL AND THIS STIRRED
242-122627-0043 I CAN NOW CONJECTURE READILY THAT THIS STREAK OF LIGHT WAS IN ALL LIKELIHOOD A GLEAM FROM A LANTERN CARRIED BY SOME ONE ACROSS THE LAWN BUT THEN PREPARED AS MY MIND WAS FOR HORROR SHAKEN AS MY NERVES WERE BY AGITATION
242-122627-0044 MY HEAD GREW HOT A SOUND FILLED MY EARS WHICH I DEEMED THE RUSHING OF WINGS SOMETHING SEEMED NEAR ME I WAS OPPRESSED SUFFOCATED ENDURANCE BROKE DOWN I RUSHED TO THE DOOR AND SHOOK THE LOCK IN DESPERATE EFFORT
242-122627-0045 BESSIE AND ABBOT ENTERED MISS EYRE ARE YOU ILL SAID BESSIE
242-122627-0046 OH I SAW A LIGHT AND I THOUGHT A GHOST WOULD COME I HAD NOW GOT HOLD OF BESSIE'S HAND AND SHE DID NOT SNATCH IT FROM ME
242-122627-0047 AND WHAT A SCREAM
242-122627-0048 BUT SHE ONLY WANTED TO BRING US ALL HERE I KNOW HER NAUGHTY TRICKS WHAT IS ALL THIS
242-122627-0049 PLEADED BESSIE LET HER GO WAS THE ONLY ANSWER LOOSE BESSIE'S HAND CHILD YOU CANNOT SUCCEED IN GETTING OUT BY THESE MEANS BE ASSURED I ABHOR ARTIFICE PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN
242-122627-0050 IT IS MY DUTY TO SHOW YOU THAT TRICKS WILL NOT ANSWER YOU WILL NOW STAY HERE AN HOUR LONGER AND IT IS ONLY ON CONDITION OF PERFECT SUBMISSION AND STILLNESS THAT I SHALL LIBERATE YOU THEN O AUNT HAVE PITY
242-122627-0051 FORGIVE ME I CANNOT ENDURE IT LET ME BE PUNISHED SOME OTHER WAY I SHALL BE KILLED IF SILENCE
242-122627-0052 AND SO NO DOUBT SHE FELT IT I WAS A PRECOCIOUS ACTRESS IN HER EYES SHE SINCERELY LOOKED ON ME AS A COMPOUND OF VIRULENT PASSIONS MEAN SPIRIT AND DANGEROUS DUPLICITY BESSIE AND ABBOT HAVING RETREATED
242-122627-0053 MISSUS REED IMPATIENT OF MY NOW FRANTIC ANGUISH AND WILD SOBS ABRUPTLY THRUST ME BACK AND LOCKED ME IN WITHOUT FARTHER PARLEY I HEARD HER SWEEPING AWAY AND SOON AFTER SHE WAS GONE I SUPPOSE I HAD A SPECIES OF FIT
