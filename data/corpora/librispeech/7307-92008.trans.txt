7307-92008-0000 MARIE DISPENSING HER SOUP AS USUAL BEFORE SHE WENT TO THE TABLE
7307-92008-0001 AND BELOW HER THERE WERE VACANT SEATS
7307-92008-0002 IT HAD ALL BEEN ARRANGED BY MARIE HERSELF WITH THE GREATEST CARE
7307-92008-0003 AND WHEN MARIE CAME TO THE TABLE BOWED TO HER GRACIOUSLY SHE BOWED IN RETURN
7307-92008-0004 MICHEL VOSS OVERDID HIS PART A LITTLE BY TOO MUCH TALKING BUT HIS WIFE RESTORED THE BALANCE BY HER PRUDENCE GEORGE TOLD THEM HOW STRONG THE FRENCH PARTY WAS AT COLMAR AND EXPLAINED THAT THE GERMANS HAD NOT A LEG TO STAND UPON AS FAR AS GENERAL OPINION WENT
7307-92008-0005 WOULD ARRANGE THEMSELVES COMFORTABLY AFTER ALL WHEN SUPPER WAS DONE THE FATHER SON AND THE DISCARDED LOVER SMOKED THEIR PIPES TOGETHER AMICABLY IN THE BILLIARD ROOM THERE WAS NOT A WORD SAID THEN BY EITHER OF THEM IN CONNECTION WITH MARIE BROMAR
7307-92008-0006 ON THE NEXT MORNING THE SUN WAS BRIGHT AND THE AIR WAS AS WARM AS IT EVER IS IN OCTOBER THE DAY PERHAPS MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR AN OUT OF DOORS PARTY HAD THERE BEEN NO SPECIAL REASON FOR SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT
7307-92008-0007 BUT SEEING HOW STRONG A REASON EXISTED EVEN MADAME VOSS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE MORNING WAS FAVOURABLE WHILE THOSE PIPES OF PEACE WERE BEING SMOKED OVER NIGHT MARIE HAD BEEN PREPARING THE HAMPERS ON THE NEXT MORNING NOBODY EXCEPT MARIE HERSELF WAS VERY EARLY
7307-92008-0008 IT WAS INTENDED THAT THE DAY SHOULD BE GOT THROUGH AT ANY RATE WITH A PRETENCE OF PLEASURE
7307-92008-0009 THEN WHAT WITH UNPACKING CLIMBING ABOUT THE ROCKS AND THROWING STONES DOWN INTO THE RIVER THEY WOULD GET THROUGH THE TIME TILL TWO AT TWO THEY WOULD EAT THEIR DINNER WITH ALL THEIR SHAWLS AND GREATCOATS AROUND THEM
7307-92008-0010 THEN SMOKE THEIR CIGARS AND COME BACK WHEN THEY FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DRAG OUT THE DAY ANY LONGER MARIE WAS NOT TO TALK TO GEORGE
7307-92008-0011 THE PROGRAMME FOR THE DAY DID NOT SEEM TO BE VERY DELIGHTFUL BUT IT APPEARED TO MICHEL VOSS THAT IN THIS WAY BETTER THAN IN ANY OTHER COULD SOME LITTLE HALO BE THROWN OVER THE PARTING HOURS
7307-92008-0012 EVERYTHING WENT AS WELL AS COULD HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED THEY MANAGED TO DELAY THEIR DEPARTURE TILL NEARLY HALF PAST TWELVE
7307-92008-0013 THAT THERE HAD HARDLY BEEN ANY HEAVINESS OF TIME WHEN THEY SEATED THEMSELVES ON THE ROCKS AT HALF PAST TWO
7307-92008-0014 SAID MICHEL AS STANDING UP HE PLUNGED A KNIFE AND FORK INTO A LARGE PIE WHICH HE HAD PLACED ON A BOULDER BEFORE HIM MARIE HAS GOT NO SOUP FOR US HERE
7307-92008-0015 SOON AFTER THAT ONE CORK MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEARD TO FLY AND THEN ANOTHER AND NO STRANGER LOOKING ON WOULD HAVE BELIEVED HOW DREADFUL HAD BEEN THE ENMITY EXISTING ON THE PREVIOUS DAY OR INDEED HOW GREAT A CAUSE FOR ENMITY THERE HAD BEEN MICHEL HIMSELF WAS VERY HILARIOUS
7307-92008-0016 GEORGE FILL OUR FRIEND URMAND'S GLASS NOT SO QUICKLY GEORGE NOT SO QUICKLY YOU GIVE HIM NOTHING BUT THE FROTH
7307-92008-0017 SO SAYING MICHEL VOSS DRAINED HIS OWN TUMBLER
7307-92008-0018 INDEED EVERY COMFORT AND LUXURY HAD BEEN SHOWERED UPON HIS HEAD TO COMPENSATE HIM FOR HIS LOST BRIDE THIS WAS THE THIRD TIME THAT HE HAD BEEN BY NAME INVITED TO DRINK HIS WINE AND THREE TIMES HE HAD OBEYED
7307-92008-0019 FEELING ALSO PERHAPS THAT THAT WHICH MIGHT HAVE MADE OTHERS DRUNK HAD MADE HIM BOLD HE EXTRICATED HIMSELF FROM HIS NICHE AND STOOD UPON HIS LEGS AMONG THE ROCKS HE STOOD UPON HIS LEGS AMONG THE ROCKS AND WITH A GRACEFUL MOVEMENT OF HIS ARM
7307-92008-0020 WAVED THE GLASS ABOVE HIS HEAD WE ARE DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU HERE AMONG US MY FRIEND SAID MICHEL VOSS WHO ALSO PERHAPS HAD BEEN MADE BOLD
7307-92008-0021 MY FRIEND SAID HE
7307-92008-0022 THEN THE INNKEEPER CHEERED HIS GUEST WHEREUPON MADAME VOSS PULLED HER HUSBAND'S SLEEVE HARDER THAN BEFORE I AM INDEED CONTINUED URMAND THE BEST THING WILL BE SAID HE TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT AT ONCE YOU ALL KNOW WHY I CAME HERE
7307-92008-0023 AND YOU ALL KNOW HOW I'M GOING BACK AT THIS MOMENT HIS VOICE FALTERED A LITTLE AND HE ALMOST SOBBED BOTH THE OLD LADIES IMMEDIATELY PUT THEIR HANDKERCHIEFS TO THEIR EYES MARIE BLUSHED AND TURNED AWAY HER FACE ON TO HER UNCLE'S SHOULDER
7307-92008-0024 MADAME VOSS REMAINED IMMOVABLE SHE DREADED GREATLY ANY SYMPTOMS OF THAT COURAGE WHICH FOLLOWS THE FLYING OF CORKS IN TRUTH HOWEVER
7307-92008-0025 OF COURSE I FEEL IT A LITTLE
7307-92008-0026 I SUPPOSE IT WAS A MISTAKE BUT IT HAS BEEN RATHER TRYING TO ME BUT I AM READY TO FORGET AND FORGIVE AND THAT IS ALL I'VE GOT TO SAY THIS SPEECH WHICH ASTONISHED THEM ALL EXCEEDINGLY REMAINED UNANSWERED FOR SOME FEW MOMENTS
7307-92008-0027 AND GEORGE WAS AWARE THAT IT WOULD NOT BE FITTING FOR HIM THE TRIUMPHANT LOVER TO MAKE ANY REPLY HE COULD HARDLY HAVE SPOKEN WITHOUT SHOWING HIS TRIUMPH DURING THIS SHORT INTERVAL NO ONE SAID A WORD
7307-92008-0028 BUT AT LAST MICHEL VOSS GOT UPON HIS LEGS HIS WIFE GIVING HIM VARIOUS TWITCHES ON THE SLEEVE AS HE DID SO I NEVER WAS SO MUCH AFFECTED IN MY LIFE SAID HE AND UPON MY WORD
7307-92008-0029 AS AS ANY MAN EVER DID
7307-92008-0030 FOR WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT WAS
7307-92008-0031 DON'T UNCLE MICHEL SAID MARIE IN A WHISPER BUT MICHEL WAS TOO BOLD TO ATTEND EITHER TO WHISPERINGS OR PULLINGS OF THE SLEEVE AND WENT ON WITH HIS SPEECH
7307-92008-0032 AND I AM QUITE SURE THAT WE ALL HOPE THAT HE MAY GET AN EXCELLENT BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WIFE WITH A GOOD DOWRY AND THAT BEFORE LONG THEN HE TOO SAT DOWN AND ALL THE LADIES DRANK TO THE HEALTH AND FUTURE FORTUNES
7307-92008-0033 HE WOULD KNOW NOW HOW TO GET AWAY FROM GRANPERE WITHOUT HAVING TO PLAN A SURREPTITIOUS ESCAPE OF COURSE HE HAD COME OUT INTENDING TO BE MISERABLE TO BE KNOWN AS AN ILL USED MAN WHO HAD BEEN TREATED WITH AN AMOUNT OF CRUELTY
7307-92008-0034 SURPASSING ALL THAT HAD EVER BEEN TOLD OF IN LOVE HISTORIES TO BE DEPRESSED BY THE WEIGHT OF THE ILL USAGE WHICH HE HAD BORNE WAS A PART OF THE PLAY WHICH HE HAD TO ACT BUT THE PLAY WHEN ACTED AFTER THIS FASHION HAD IN IT SOMETHING OF PLEASING EXCITEMENT
7307-92008-0035 AND HE FELT ASSURED THAT HE WAS EXHIBITING DIGNITY IN VERY ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES GEORGE VOSS WAS PROBABLY THINKING ILL OF THE YOUNG MAN ALL THE WHILE
7307-92008-0036 AFTER THE BANQUET WAS OVER MARIE EXPRESSED HERSELF SO MUCH TOUCHED AS ALMOST TO INCUR THE JEALOUSY OF HER MORE FORTUNATE LOVER WHEN THE SPEECHES WERE FINISHED THE MEN MADE THEMSELVES HAPPY WITH THEIR CIGARS AND WINE
7307-92008-0037 TILL MADAME VOSS DECLARED THAT SHE WAS ALREADY HALF DEAD WITH THE COLD AND DAMP AND THEN THEY ALL RETURNED TO THE INN IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS THAT WHICH HAD MADE SO BOLD BOTH MICHEL AND HIS GUEST HAD NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY MORE EXTENDED OR MORE DELETERIOUS EFFECT
7307-92008-0038 TAKING THE PUBLIC CONVEYANCE AS FAR AS REMIREMONT EVERYBODY WAS UP TO SEE HIM OFF AND MARIE HERSELF GAVE HIM HIS CUP OF COFFEE AT PARTING IT WAS PRETTY TO SEE THE MINGLED GRACE AND SHAME WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CEREMONY WAS PERFORMED
7307-92008-0039 SHE HARDLY SAID A WORD INDEED WHAT WORD SHE DID SAY WAS HEARD BY NO ONE BUT SHE CROSSED HER HANDS ON HER BREAST AND THE GRAVEST SMILE CAME OVER HER FACE AND SHE TURNED HER EYES DOWN TO THE GROUND AND IF ANY ONE EVER BEGGED PARDON WITHOUT A WORD SPOKEN
7307-92008-0040 O YES OF COURSE HE SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT IT'S ALL RIGHT THEN SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND AND SAID GOOD BYE AND RAN AWAY UP INTO HER ROOM
7307-92008-0041 THAN THOSE WITH WHICH THE READER HAS BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED AND NOW SAID GEORGE AS SOON AS THE DILIGENCE HAD STARTED OUT OF THE YARD WELL AND WHAT NOW ASKED THE FATHER I MUST BE OFF TO COLMAR NEXT NOT TO DAY GEORGE
7307-92008-0042 YES TO DAY OR THIS EVENING AT LEAST BUT I MUST SETTLE SOMETHING FIRST
7307-92008-0043 YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN FATHER O YES I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
7307-92008-0044 HE GAVE NO FARTHER PERMISSION THAN THIS BUT GEORGE THOUGHT THAT SO MUCH WAS SUFFICIENT GEORGE DID RETURN TO COLMAR THAT EVENING BEING IN ALL MATTERS OF BUSINESS A MAN ACCURATE AND RESOLUTE
7307-92008-0045 BY MARIE BROMAR IT WAS YOUR FAULT SAID MARIE YOUR FAULT FROM BEGINNING TO END IT SHALL BE IF YOU SAY SO ANSWERED GEORGE BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT I SEE IT
7307-92008-0046 WHAT IS A PERSON TO THINK GEORGE
