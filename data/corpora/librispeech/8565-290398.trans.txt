8565-290398-0000 WE HAVE BEEN VISITED BY THE DANISH RESIDENTS THE CHIEF TRADER OR GOVERNOR THE PRIEST AND TWO OTHERS THEIR LATEST EUROPEAN INTELLIGENCE IS NOT MORE RECENT THAN OUR OWN BUT THE DANISH SHIP IS HOURLY EXPECTED SHE USUALLY LEAVES COPENHAGEN ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF MARCH
8565-290398-0001 THE WINTER HERE HAS BEEN JUST THE REVERSE OF OUR OWN EXPERIENCE IT HAS BEEN SEVERE IN POINT OF TEMPERATURE BUT WITH VERY LITTLE WIND THE LAND LIES BURIED IN SNOW AND AS YET THERE IS NO THAW IT IS TOO EARLY FOR THE COD FISHERY AND NOT A SINGLE REINDEER HAS BEEN KILLED THROUGHOUT THE WINTER
8565-290398-0002 EIDER DUCKS LOOMS AND DOVEKIES ARE ABUNDANT AS WELL AS HARES AND PTARMIGAN
8565-290398-0003 OUR POOR HALF FAMISHED DOGS HAVE BEEN LANDED NEAR THE CARCASES OF FOUR WHALES SO THEY MUST BE SUPREMELY HAPPY I VISITED THE GOVERNOR TO DAY AND FOUND HIS LITTLE WOODEN HOUSE AS SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN AND NEAT AS THE HOUSES OF THE DANISH RESIDENTS IN GREENLAND INVARIABLY ARE
8565-290398-0004 AND THE ILL FATED VESSEL HAS NEVER SINCE BEEN HEARD OF POOR GOVERNOR ELBERG IS IN ILL HEALTH AND TALKS OF RETURNING HOME
8565-290398-0005 THE INHABITANTS ARE ALL DRESSED IN THEIR SUNDAY CLOTHES AT LEAST ALL WHO HAVE GOT A CHANGE OF GARMENTS AND THERE IS BOTH MORNING AND EVENING SERVICE IN THE SMALL WOODEN CHURCH AS THE GOVERNOR COULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR OF THE DANCE HOUSE OUR MEN RETURNED ON BOARD EARLY
8565-290398-0006 YESTERDAY EVENING THEY WERE ALL ON SHORE AND WITH THE ESQUIMAUX WERE SQUEEZED INTO THIS ONE LARGE ROOM
8565-290398-0007 OLD HARVEY CONSTITUTED HIMSELF MASTER OF THE CEREMONIES AND WITH HIS FLUTE LED THE ORCHESTRA IT CONSISTED OF ONE OTHER FLUTE AND A FIDDLE HE MANAGED TO PERCH HIMSELF ABOVE ALL THE REST AT ONE END OF THE ROOM
8565-290398-0008 AND PLAYED WITH SUCH VIGOR THAT OUR BLUEJACKETS AND THE ESQUIMAUX LADIES DANCED AWAY MOST FURIOUSLY FOR HOURS THESE LADIES CAN DANCE IN THE LEAST POSSIBLE SPACE THEIR COSTUME BEING PARTICULARLY WELL ADAPTED FOR THE PURPOSE PARTAKING AS IT DOES MUCH MORE OF THE BLOOMER THAN THE CRINOLINE
8565-290398-0009 IT IS SAID TO OCCUPY THE CENTRE OF AN EXTINCT VOLCANO BUT I SAW NOTHING TO BEAR OUT THE ASSERTION THIS IS THE ONLY PART OF GREENLAND WHERE EARTHQUAKES ARE FELT THE GOVERNOR TOLD ME OF AN UNUSUALLY SEVERE SHOCK WHICH OCCURRED A WINTER OR TWO AGO
8565-290398-0010 HE WAS SITTING IN HIS ROOM READING AT THE TIME WHEN HE HEARD A LOUD NOISE LIKE THE DISCHARGE OF A CANNON IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS A TREMULOUS MOTION WAS FELT SOME GLASSES UPON THE TABLE BEGAN TO DANCE ABOUT AND PAPERS LYING UPON THE WINDOW SILL FELL DOWN AFTER A FEW SECONDS IT CEASED
8565-290398-0011 BUT A LITTLE MORE ANIMAL LIFE REINDEER FOR INSTANCE WOULD MAKE IT FAR MORE PLEASING IN OUR EYES
8565-290398-0012 THE CLERGYMAN OF HOLSTEINBORG WAS BORN IN THIS COLONY AND HAS SUCCEEDED HIS FATHER IN THE PRIESTLY OFFICE HIS WIFE IS THE ONLY EUROPEAN FEMALE IN THE COLONY
8565-290398-0013 BEING TOLD THAT FUEL WAS EXTREMELY SCARCE IN THE DANISH HOUSES AND THAT THE PRIEST'S WIFE WAS BLUE WITH THE COLD I SENT ON SHORE A PRESENT OF SOME COALS ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON HEARING THE CHURCH BELL RINGING I WENT ON SHORE IT PROVED TO BE ONLY A CHRISTENING
8565-290398-0014 BUT HE REPLIED WITH GREAT SIMPLICITY THAT HE HAD NEVER PROMISED HER AND WOULD NOT MARRY HER AS HIS FRIENDS OBJECTED TO THE MATCH WHAT ARE THE GOOD GREENLANDERS COMING TO I RECOMMENDED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE HIS BETROTHED IN HER OWN HOME WITH HER MOTHER AND FAMILY HIS ASKING A PASSAGE FOR HER
8565-290398-0015 IN ORDER TO LEAVE HER WITH HIS MOTHER IS STRONG PROOF OF THE SINCERITY OF HIS ENGAGEMENT NOT ONLY TO HIS LADY LOVE BUT TO THE FOX ALSO I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE ADMIRALTY TO ACCOUNT FOR MY PROLONGED ABSENCE FROM ENGLAND AND TO DOCTOR RINK TO ACQUAINT HIM WITH THE CAUSE OF MY SECOND VISIT TO HIS INSPECTORATE
8565-290398-0016 GOVERNOR ELBERG HAS PROMISED TO GET ME SOME FOSSIL FISH TO BE FOUND ONLY IN NORTH STROM FIORD THEY ARE INTERESTING AS BEING OF UNKNOWN GEOLOGICAL DATE
8565-290398-0017 OUT IN THE OFFING THE WEATHER WAS GLOOMY AND COLD AND STRONG NORTHERLY WINDS WERE BLOWING ON CLOSING THE LAND AGAIN WE REGAINED THE OFF SHORE WIND AND BRIGHT WEATHER
8565-290398-0018 THIS WAS A BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT MORE PARTICULARLY AS A GALE OF WIND WITH HEAVY SEA WAS FAST RISING AND SNOW BEGINNING TO FALL THICKLY
8565-290398-0019 ON THE EVENING OF THE TENTH WE STOOD OFF FROM THE INHOSPITABLE BARRIER OF ICE PREPARED TO MEET THE STORM SNOW FELL SO THICKLY THAT WE COULD HARDLY SEE THE ICEBERGS IN TIME TO AVOID THEM WE SUPPOSED OURSELVES TO BE WELL TO LEEWARD OF THE WHALEFISH ISLANDS BUT WERE DECEIVED BY THE TIDES
8565-290398-0020 SUDDENLY A SMALL LOW ISLET WAS SEEN ON THE LEE BOW NOT BEING ABLE TO PASS TO WINDWARD WE WERE OBLIGED TO WEAR SHIP AND IN DOING SO PASSED WITHIN THE SHIP'S LENGTH OF DESTRUCTION FOR WE WERE CERTAINLY WITHIN THAT DISTANCE OF THE ROCKS
8565-290398-0021 ON THE ELEVENTH THE WEATHER IMPROVED AND IN THE EVENING WE CAME TO OUR PRESENT ANCHORAGE FROM A HILL WE CAN WATCH AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENTER GODHAVN
8565-290398-0022 NOTWITHSTANDING THE BLOWING WEATHER SOME NATIVES CAME ABOUT FIVE MILES OFF TO US THE WATER WASHED OVER THEIR LITTLE KAYAKS AND KEPT THE OCCUPANTS SEAL SKIN DRESSES STREAMING WITH WET UP TO THEIR SHOULDERS THIS PART OF THEIR DRESS SEEMS RATHER PART OF THE KAYAK
8565-290398-0023 AS IT IS ATTACHED TO IT ROUND THE HOLE IN WHICH THE KAYAKER SITS SO THAT NO WATER CAN ENTER IT IS WONDERFUL TO SEE HOW CLOSELY A MAN CAN ASSIMILATE HIS HABITS TO THOSE OF A FISH
8565-290398-0024 TWO VESSELS ARE IN SIGHT THE WORLD IT APPEARS IS AT PEACE PETERSEN WAS AT ONE TIME IN CHARGE OF THIS STATION HE IS NOW SEEKING OUT HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCES
8565-290398-0025 REQUESTING HER CAPTAIN TO LEND ME SOME NEWSPAPERS THE NOTE REACHED CAPTAIN J WALKER OF THE JANE AND YESTERDAY HIS SHIP ACCOMPANIED BY THE HEROINE CAPTAIN J SIMPSON APPROACHED US AND THEY BOTH CAME IN TO CALL UPON ME EACH OF THEM BRINGING THE VERY ACCEPTABLE PRESENT OF SOME NEWSPAPERS BESIDES A QUARTER OF BEEF WITH VEGETABLES
8565-290398-0026 NOTHING COULD EXCEED THEIR SINCERE GOOD FEELING AND KINDNESS THEY OFFERED TO SUPPLY ME WITH ANYTHING THEIR SHIPS COULD AFFORD THE ACCOUNT THEY GIVE OF LAST SEASON IS AS FOLLOWS THE WHALERS REACHED DEVIL'S POINT NEAR MELVILLE BAY AS EARLY AS THE TWENTY FIRST OF MAY
8565-290398-0027 SOUTHERLY WINDS THEN SET IN AND BLEW INCESSANTLY FOR SIX WEEKS DURING ALL WHICH TIME THEY WERE CLOSELY BESET AND THE SHIPS GIPSY AND UNDAUNTED WERE CRUSHED WHEN ABLE TO MOVE THE FLEET RETURNED SOUTHWARD ALONG THE PACK EDGE WHICH WAS EVERYWHERE FOUND TO BE IMPENETRABLE THEY SAILED SOUTHWARD OF DISCO
8565-290398-0028 THE FORMER LYING AGAINST THE WEST LAND ABOUT CAPE SEARLE WHILST THE LATTER WAS FORCED NORTHWARD AND PRESSED CLOSELY INTO MELVILLE BAY THE SHIPS SAILED FREELY BETWEEN THESE TWO GREAT DIVISIONS AND FOUND THE WEST WATER UNUSUALLY EXTENSIVE
8565-290398-0029 HAD I BEEN ABLE TO COLLECT A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF SLEDGE DOGS AT GODHAVN LAST YEAR IT WAS MY INTENTION TO HAVE SAILED ACROSS TO THE WEST SIDE IF POSSIBLE INSTEAD OF PURSUING THE USUAL ROUTE THROUGH MELVILLE BAY BUT THE OPINIONS OF THE CAPTAINS OF THE LOST WHALERS WERE IN FAVOR OF A MELVILLE BAY PASSAGE
8565-290398-0030 ONLY A FEW DAYS AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SUMMER'S THAW CAPTAIN WALKER TELLS ME THERE ARE MANY YEARS IN WHICH THE WHALERS CAN PASS UP THE WESTERN SHORE LATE IN THE SEASON BUT NOT ALWAYS SO FAR AS POND'S BAY OF MELVILLE BAY AFTER THE TENTH OR FIFTEENTH JULY THEY KNOW NOTHING
8565-290398-0031 BUT THE VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY AFFORD US AMPLE DETAILS WHILST OF THE SOUTHERN ROUTE ALMOST NOTHING HAS BEEN MADE PUBLICLY KNOWN THERE ARE MANY INTELLIGENT WHALING CAPTAINS WHO POSSESS MUCH VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE OF THESE LANDS AND SEAS AND EVEN IN THE TERRA INCOGNITA OF FROBISHER'S STRAITS
8565-290398-0032 WHALERS HAVE WINTERED WHILST OUR CHARTS SCARCELY AFFORD EVEN A VAGUE IDEA OF THE CONFIGURATION OF THESE EXTENSIVE ISLANDS
8565-290398-0033 SCOTT'S INLET IS ALSO SAID TO BE A STRAIT LEADING INTO A WESTERN ARM OF THE SAME SEA
8565-290398-0034 WE ARE REFITTING SHOOTING AND DEVOURING QUANTITIES OF EXCELLENT MUSSELS EIDER DUCKS ARE VERY ABUNDANT BUT EXTREMELY SHY POOR PUSS HAS BEEN KILLED
8565-290398-0035 THIS EVENING YOUNG AND I EXAMINED A NARROW ROCKY COVE UPERNIVIK BAY OF THE NATIVES FINDING IT SUITABLE FOR OUR PURPOSE THE SHIP WAS BROUGHT IN AND MOORED TO THE ROCKS WE WERE RECEIVED WITH MUCH KINDNESS BY OUR FRIENDS MISTER AND MISSUS OLRIK AND WERE PRESENTED WITH A FILE OF LATE ENGLISH PAPERS
8565-290398-0036 A CONSIDERABLE SUPPLY OF BEER WAS ORDERED TO BE BREWED FOR US I FOUND MISSUS OLRIK WITHOUT A FIRE IN HER SITTING ROOM IT WAS UNNECESSARY
8565-290398-0037 THE WINDOWS LOOKED TO THE SOUTH AND THE SUN SHONE BRIGHTLY IN UPON A PROFUSION OF GERANIUMS AND EUROPEAN FLOWERS AT ONCE REMINDING ONE OF HOME AND REFRESHING THE SENSES BY THEIR PERFUME AND BEAUTY THE MERRY VOICES OF THE CHILDREN WERE ALSO A MOST PLEASING NOVELTY
8565-290398-0038 MISTER OLRIK SAYS THE PAST WINTER HAS NOT BEEN IN ANY WAY REMARKABLE EXCEPT FOR THE PREVALENCE OF STRONG WINDS
8565-290398-0039 WE DID HONOR TO HER MAJESTY'S BIRTHDAY BY DRESSING THE FOX IN ALL HER FLAGS AND REGALING HER CREW WITH PLUM PUDDING AND GROG THE ICE HAVING MOVED OFF WE HAVE COME INTO THE HARBOR OF GODHAVN AS BEING MORE CONVENIENT AND SAFE THE DAY HAS BEEN A BUSY ONE
8565-290398-0040 I HAVE ADDED ANOTHER ESQUIMAUX LAD TO OUR CREW TAKING WITH HIM HIS RIFLE KAYAK AND SLEDGE THIS EVENING THERE HAS BEEN A BRISK INTERCHANGE OF PRESENTS BETWEEN US AND OUR DANISH FRIENDS I HAVE BEEN GIVEN AN EIDER DOWN COVERLET BY THE GOVERNOR MISTER ANDERSEN
8565-290398-0041 AND BY MISSUS OLRIK SOME DELICIOUS PRESERVE OF GREENLAND CRANBERRIES A TIN OF PRESERVED PTARMIGAN AND A JAR OF PICKLED WHALE SKIN MY TABLE IS DECKED WITH EUROPEAN FLOWERS INCLUDING ROSES MIGNONETTE AND VIOLETS WITH GOOD REASON SHALL WE REMEMBER GODHAVN
8565-290398-0042 A PARTY OF SEAL HUNTERS FROM ATANEKERDLUK CAME OFF TO US AND THEIR HUNTING HAVING TERMINATED SUCCESSFULLY THEY WILL ASSIST US IN COALING FROM THESE MEN I OBTAINED MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PART OF THE COAST
8565-290398-0043 WITHIN A RANGE OF TWENTY MILES UPON THE DISCO SHORE THERE ARE FOUR DISTINCT COALING PLACES BUT AT THIS EARLY SEASON TWO OF THEM ARE DEEPLY COVERED WITH SNOW
8565-290398-0044 THE ICE IN THIS STRAIT BROKE UP AS LONG AGO AS THE THIRD APRIL IT HAS ALL DRIFTED OUT TO THE NORTHWARD ONLY A FEW ICEBERGS NOW REMAIN
8565-290398-0045 THE BUSINESS OF COALING WAS VERY SPEEDILY AND SATISFACTORILY COMPLETED BUT THE QUALITY OF THE COALS IS VERY INFERIOR UPON THE GREEN SLOPES OUR SPORTSMEN FOUND NOTHING BUT A FEW PTARMIGAN AND A HARE SHORTLY AFTER RUNNING CLOSE PAST THE DESERTED SETTLEMENT OF NOURSOAK
8565-290398-0046 WE ARRIVED OFF A SMALL BAY AND WERE STARTLED BY FINDING THE WATER HAD SUDDENLY CHANGED FROM TRANSPARENT BLUE TO A THICK MUDDY COLOR BUT THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN ITS DEPTH WE WERE CROSSING THE STREAM OF MAKKAKS ELVIN OR CLAY RIVER
8565-290398-0047 WHICH EMPTIES ITSELF INTO THE BAY AFTER RUNNING THROUGH A BROAD AND EXTENSIVE VALLEY SAID TO ABOUND WITH REINDEER THIS RIVER HAS ITS ORIGIN IN LAKES AND GLACIERS IN THE INTERIOR AND THE DISCOLORATION OF THE WATER IS PROBABLY THE CHIEF CAUSE OF SUCCESS IN WHITE WHALE FISHING
8565-290398-0048 THE SEASON APPEARS FORWARD AND THE ICE MUCH DECAYED BUT SOUTHERLY WINDS PREVAIL RETARDING ITS DISRUPTION AND REMOVAL CAPTAIN PARKER OF THE EMMA TELLS ME HE DOES NOT EXPECT TO MAKE A NORTH PASSAGE THIS YEAR
8565-290398-0049 AND AS HIS EXPERIENCE EXTENDS OVER A PERIOD OF AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS I GIVE HIS REASON IT IS SIMPLY THIS THAT AS DURING THE MONTHS OF FEBRUARY MARCH AND APRIL NORTHERLY WINDS PREVAILED TO AN UNUSUAL DEGREE THEREFORE SOUTHERLY WINDS MAY NOW BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IF HE PROVE A PROPHET
8565-290398-0050 THE FORMER HAS GENEROUSLY SUPPLIED US WITH MANY THINGS WE WERE RATHER SHORT OF NOT ONLY IN SHIP'S STORES BUT PROVISIONS AND COALS AND IN RETURN I HAVE OF COURSE FURNISHED HIM WITH A RECEIPT FOR HIS OWNERS
8565-290398-0051 CAPTAIN SIMPSON HAS MOST HANDSOMELY PRESENTED THE FOX WITH A SAIL AND YARDS WHICH AFTER SOME SLIGHT ALTERATIONS WILL ENABLE US TO ADD A MAIN TOPSAIL TO OUR SPREAD OF CANVAS
8565-290398-0052 FOR THE TWO DAYS WE LAY AT THE ICEBERG ALONGSIDE OF THE EMMA I MADE FURIOUS ATTACKS UPON CAPTAIN PARKER'S BEEFSTEAKS AND PORTER WE AMPLY AVAILED OURSELVES OF HIS HEARTY WELCOME BY THE ARRIVAL OF THE FINE STEAM WHALER TAY FROM SCOTLAND WE HAVE RECEIVED PAPERS UP TO SEVENTEENTH APRIL
8565-290398-0053 THIS MORNING WE SLOWLY STEAMED AWAY FROM UPERNIVIK THREADING OUR WAY BETWIXT ISLANDS AND ICE FOR ABOUT THIRTY MILES AND NOW AWAIT FURTHER ICE MOVEMENT BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO PROCEED
8565-290398-0054 THESE ARE CALLED THE WOMAN ISLANDS SO NAMED BY THE CELEBRATED ARCTIC EXPLORER JOHN DAVIS WHO VISITED THEM IN QUEEN ELIZABETH'S REIGN
8565-290398-0055 UPON ONE OF THESE ISLANDS A STONE WAS PICKED UP SOME THIRTY YEARS AGO BEARING A RUNIC INSCRIPTION IT WAS SENT HOME TO COPENHAGEN AS A MOST INTERESTING RELIC OF THE EARLY SCANDINAVIAN VOYAGERS BUT NOTHING WAS ON IT EXCEPT THE NAMES OF THOSE MEN WHO CLEARED THIS PLACE OR FORMED A SETTLEMENT
8565-290398-0056 AND THE DATE ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE IN ALL PROBABILITY THEIR SOJOURN WAS EXTREMELY SHORT
8565-290398-0057 THE DANISH TRADING ESTABLISHMENTS GRADUALLY EXTENDED ALONG THE COAST AND UPERNIVIK WAS ONE OF THEM
8565-290398-0058 DURING NAPOLEON'S WARS ALL THE DANISH POSTS WERE WITHDRAWN AS THE BRITISH FLEET EFFECTUALLY CUT OFF COMMUNICATION WITH EUROPE
