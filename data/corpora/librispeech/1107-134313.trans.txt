1107-134313-0000 T X CAME FROM DOWNING STREET AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK ONE NIGHT AND HIS HEART WAS FILLED WITH JOY AND GRATITUDE HE SWUNG HIS STICK TO THE COMMON DANGER OF THE PUBLIC BUT THE POLICEMAN ON POINT DUTY AT THE END OF THE STREET
1107-134313-0001 RECOGNIZED AND SALUTED HIM DID NOT THINK IT FIT TO ISSUE ANY OFFICIAL WARNING HE RAN UP THE STAIRS TO HIS OFFICE AND FOUND MANSUS READING THE EVENING PAPER MY POOR DUMB BEAST SAID T X
1107-134313-0002 WHERE DID YOU GET THAT RIDICULOUS NAME BY THE WAY M OR N REPLIED MANSUS LACONICALLY I REPEAT THAT THERE IS THE DAWN OF AN INTELLECT IN YOU SAID T X OFFENSIVELY
1107-134313-0003 HE BECAME MORE SERIOUS AS HE TOOK FROM A POCKET INSIDE HIS WAISTCOAT A LONG BLUE ENVELOPE CONTAINING THE PAPER WHICH HAD COST HIM SO MUCH TO SECURE FINDING THE REVOLVER WAS A MASTER STROKE OF YOURS MANSUS HE SAID AND HE WAS IN EARNEST AS HE SPOKE
1107-134313-0004 THE MAN COLOURED WITH PLEASURE FOR THE SUBORDINATES OF T X LOVED HIM AND A WORD OF PRAISE WAS ALMOST EQUAL TO PROMOTION IT WAS ON THE ADVICE OF MANSUS THAT THE ROAD FROM LONDON TO LEWES HAD BEEN CAREFULLY COVERED AND SUCH STREAMS AS PASSED BENEATH THAT ROAD HAD BEEN SEARCHED
1107-134313-0005 OBVIOUSLY THE GIFT OF ONE BRIGAND TO ANOTHER WAS T X S COMMENT ARMED WITH THIS HIS TASK WOULD HAVE BEEN FAIRLY EASY BUT WHEN TO THIS EVIDENCE HE ADDED A ROUGH DRAFT OF THE THREATENING LETTER
1107-134313-0006 THE CASE WAS COMPLETE BUT WHAT CLINCHED THE MATTER WAS THE FINDING OF A WAD OF THAT PECULIAR CHEMICAL PAPER
1107-134313-0007 AND THE HOME SECRETARY BY SIMPLY EXPOSING THEM FOR A FEW SECONDS TO THE LIGHT OF AN ELECTRIC LAMP INSTANTLY IT HAD FILLED THE HOME SECRETARY'S OFFICE WITH A PUNGENT AND MOST DISAGREEABLE SMOKE FOR WHICH HE WAS HEARTILY CURSED BY HIS SUPERIORS
1107-134313-0008 BUT IT HAD ROUNDED OFF THE ARGUMENT HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
1107-134313-0009 I DON'T THINK ANY HOUR WOULD BE TOO LATE SUGGESTED MANSUS YOU SHALL COME AND CHAPERON ME SAID HIS SUPERIOR BUT A DISAPPOINTMENT AWAITED MISSUS LEXMAN WAS NOT IN
1107-134313-0010 AND NEITHER THE RINGING AT HER ELECTRIC BELL NOR VIGOROUS APPLICATIONS TO THE KNOCKER BROUGHT ANY RESPONSE THE HALL PORTER OF THE FLATS WHERE SHE LIVED WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT MISSUS LEXMAN HAD GONE OUT OF TOWN SHE FREQUENTLY WENT OUT ON SATURDAYS AND RETURNED ON THE MONDAY
1107-134313-0011 AND HE THOUGHT OCCASIONALLY ON TUESDAYS IT HAPPENED THAT THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT WAS A MONDAY NIGHT AND T X WAS FACED WITH A DILEMMA THE NIGHT PORTER
1107-134313-0012 THOUGHT THAT THE DAY PORTER MIGHT KNOW MORE AND AROUSED HIM FROM HIS SLEEP YES MISSUS LEXMAN HAD GONE SHE WENT ON THE SUNDAY AN UNUSUAL DAY TO PAY A WEEK END VISIT
1107-134313-0013 NOBODY OUTSIDE THE OFFICE SAID MANSUS UNLESS UNLESS UNLESS WHAT ASKED THE OTHER IRRITABLY DON'T BE A JIMP MANSUS GET IT OFF YOUR MIND WHAT IS IT I AM WONDERING SAID MANSUS SLOWLY
1107-134313-0014 IF THE LANDLORD AT GREAT JAMES STREET SAID ANYTHING HE KNOWS WE HAVE MADE A SEARCH WE CAN EASILY FIND THAT OUT SAID T X THEY HAILED A TAXI AND DROVE TO GREAT JAMES STREET THAT RESPECTABLE THOROUGHFARE WAS WRAPPED IN SLEEP
1107-134313-0015 RECOGNIZING T X HE CHECKED HIS SARCASM WHICH HE HAD PREPARED FOR A KEYLESS LODGER
1107-134313-0016 WHAT LIKE OF MAN WAS HE ASKED T X THE BRIEF DESCRIPTION THE MAN GAVE SENT A COLD CHILL TO THE COMMISSIONER'S HEART
1107-134313-0017 REMEMBERING THAT HIS PREDECESSOR HAD LOST HIS JOB FROM A TOO CONFIDING FRIENDLINESS
1107-134313-0018 HE DID NOT KNOW WHEN MISTER KARA WOULD RETURN PERHAPS IT WOULD BE A LONG TIME AND PERHAPS A SHORT TIME HE MIGHT COME BACK THAT NIGHT OR HE MIGHT NOT YOU ARE WASTING YOUR YOUNG LIFE SAID T X BITTERLY YOU OUGHT TO BE A FORTUNE TELLER
1107-134313-0019 THIS SETTLES THE MATTER HE SAID IN THE CAB ON THE WAY BACK FIND OUT THE FIRST TRAIN FOR TAVISTOCK IN THE MORNING AND WIRE THE GEORGE HOTEL TO HAVE A CAR WAITING
1107-134313-0020 TOO LATE HE SAID UNLESS YOU CAN INVENT A METHOD OF GETTING FROM HERE TO PADDINGTON IN ABOUT FIFTY SECONDS THE MORNING JOURNEY TO DEVONSHIRE WAS A DISPIRITING ONE DESPITE THE FINENESS OF THE DAY T X HAD AN UNCOMFORTABLE SENSE THAT SOMETHING DISTRESSING HAD HAPPENED
1107-134313-0021 AS THEY SPUN DOWN TO THE VALLEY OF THE DART MANSUS TOUCHED HIS ARM LOOK AT THAT HE SAID AND POINTED TO THE BLUE HEAVENS WHERE A MILE ABOVE THEIR HEADS A WHITE WINGED AEROPLANE LOOKING NO LARGER THAN A VERY DISTANT DRAGON FLY SHIMMERED IN THE SUNLIGHT
1107-134313-0022 WHEN HE WAS HELD UP BY AN ARMED GUARD A GLANCE AT HIS CARD WAS ENOUGH TO PASS HIM WHAT IS THE MATTER HE ASKED A PRISONER HAS ESCAPED SAID THE SENTRY ESCAPED BY AEROPLANE ASKED T X I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT AEROPLANES SIR
1107-134313-0023 ALL I KNOW IS THAT ONE OF THE WORKING PARTY GOT AWAY THE CAR CAME TO THE GATES OF THE PRISON AND T X SPRANG OUT FOLLOWED BY HIS ASSISTANT HE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE GOVERNOR A GREATLY PERTURBED MAN FOR AN ESCAPE IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER
1107-134313-0024 THE OFFICIAL WAS INCLINED TO BE BRUSQUE IN HIS MANNER BUT AGAIN THE MAGIC CARD PRODUCED A SOOTHING EFFECT I AM RATHER RATTLED SAID THE GOVERNOR ONE OF MY MEN HAS GOT AWAY I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW THAT
1107-134313-0025 THIS IS AN ORDER FOR THE RELEASE OF JOHN LEXMAN CONVICTED UNDER SENTENCE OF FIFTEEN YEARS PENAL SERVITUDE THE GOVERNOR LOOKED AT IT
