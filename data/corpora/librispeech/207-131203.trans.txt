207-131203-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN DIAMOND GOES ON DIAMOND BECAME A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH ALL THE MEN ABOUT THE MEWS SOME MAY THINK IT WAS NOT THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD FOR HIM TO BE BROUGHT UP IN BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR THERE HE WAS
207-131203-0001 AT FIRST HE HEARD A GOOD MANY ROUGH AND BAD WORDS BUT HE DID NOT LIKE THEM AND SO THEY DID HIM LITTLE HARM HE DID NOT KNOW IN THE LEAST WHAT THEY MEANT
207-131203-0002 AND IN THE TONE OF VOICE IN WHICH THEY WERE SAID WHICH DIAMOND FELT TO BE UGLY SO THEY DID NOT EVEN STICK TO HIM NOT TO SAY GET INSIDE HIM HE NEVER TOOK ANY NOTICE OF THEM
207-131203-0003 LIKE A PRIMROSE IN A HAILSTORM AT FIRST BECAUSE HIS FACE WAS SO QUIET AND SWEET WITH A SMILE ALWAYS EITHER AWAKE OR ASLEEP IN HIS EYES AND BECAUSE HE NEVER HEEDED THEIR UGLY WORDS AND ROUGH JOKES THEY SAID HE WASN'T ALL THERE
207-131203-0004 AND THE WORDS CHOKED THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY GOT ANY FARTHER WHEN THEY TALKED TO HIM NICELY HE HAD ALWAYS A GOOD ANSWER SOMETIMES A SMART ONE READY AND THAT HELPED MUCH TO MAKE THEM CHANGE THEIR MINDS ABOUT HIM
207-131203-0005 ONE DAY JACK GAVE HIM A CURRY COMB AND A BRUSH TO TRY HIS HAND UPON OLD DIAMOND'S COAT HE USED THEM SO DEFTLY SO GENTLY AND YET SO THOROUGHLY AS FAR AS HE COULD REACH THAT THE MAN COULD NOT HELP ADMIRING HIM YOU MUST MAKE HASTE AND GROW HE SAID
207-131203-0006 IT WON'T DO TO HAVE A HORSE'S BELLY CLEAN AND HIS BACK DIRTY YOU KNOW GIVE ME A LEG SAID DIAMOND AND IN A MOMENT HE WAS ON THE OLD HORSE'S BACK WITH THE COMB AND BRUSH HE SAT ON HIS WITHERS AND REACHING FORWARD AS HE ATE HIS HAY
207-131203-0007 HE CURRIED AND HE BRUSHED FIRST AT ONE SIDE OF HIS NECK AND THEN AT THE OTHER WHEN THAT WAS DONE HE ASKED FOR A DRESSING COMB AND COMBED HIS MANE THOROUGHLY THEN HE PUSHED HIMSELF ON TO HIS BACK
207-131203-0008 THEN HE SAT ON HIS CROUP AND DID HIS BACK AND SIDES
207-131203-0009 AND ONCE HE SENT THE COMB FLYING OUT OF THE STABLE DOOR TO THE GREAT AMUSEMENT OF THE MEN BUT JACK FETCHED IT AGAIN AND DIAMOND BEGAN ONCE MORE AND DID NOT LEAVE OFF UNTIL HE HAD DONE THE WHOLE BUSINESS FAIRLY WELL IF NOT IN A FIRST RATE EXPERIENCED FASHION
207-131203-0010 ALL THE TIME THE OLD HORSE WENT ON EATING HIS HAY AND BUT WITH AN OCCASIONAL WHISK OF HIS TAIL WHEN DIAMOND TICKLED OR SCRATCHED HIM TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE PROCEEDING BUT THAT WAS ALL A PRETENCE FOR HE KNEW VERY WELL WHO IT WAS THAT WAS PERCHED ON HIS BACK AND RUBBING AWAY AT HIM WITH THE COMB AND THE BRUSH
207-131203-0011 SO HE WAS QUITE PLEASED AND PROUD AND PERHAPS SAID TO HIMSELF SOMETHING LIKE THIS I'M A STUPID OLD HORSE WHO CAN'T BRUSH HIS OWN COAT BUT THERE'S MY YOUNG GODSON ON MY BACK CLEANING ME LIKE AN ANGEL I WON'T VOUCH FOR WHAT THE OLD HORSE WAS THINKING
207-131203-0012 FOR IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT WHAT ANY OLD HORSE IS THINKING OH DEAR SAID DIAMOND WHEN HE HAD DONE I'M SO TIRED AND HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN AT FULL LENGTH ON OLD DIAMOND'S BACK BY THIS TIME ALL THE MEN IN THE STABLE WERE GATHERED ABOUT THE TWO DIAMONDS AND ALL MUCH AMUSED
207-131203-0013 ONE OF THEM LIFTED HIM DOWN AND FROM THAT TIME HE WAS A GREATER FAVOURITE THAN BEFORE AND IF EVER THERE WAS A BOY WHO HAD A CHANCE OF BEING A PRODIGY AT CAB DRIVING DIAMOND WAS THAT BOY FOR THE STRIFE CAME TO BE WHO SHOULD HAVE HIM OUT WITH HIM ON THE BOX
207-131203-0014 HIS MOTHER HOWEVER WAS A LITTLE SHY OF THE COMPANY FOR HIM AND BESIDES SHE COULD NOT ALWAYS SPARE HIM ALSO HIS FATHER LIKED TO HAVE HIM HIMSELF WHEN HE COULD SO THAT HE WAS MORE DESIRED THAN ENJOYED AMONG THE CABMEN
207-131203-0015 FOR ONE THING HE NEVER GOT FRIGHTENED AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS NEVER IN TOO GREAT A HURRY YET WHEN THE MOMENT CAME FOR DOING SOMETHING SHARP HE WAS ALWAYS READY FOR IT I MUST ONCE MORE REMIND MY READERS THAT HE HAD BEEN TO THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND
207-131203-0016 ONE DAY WHICH WAS NEITHER WASHING DAY NOR CLEANING DAY NOR MARKETING DAY NOR SATURDAY NOR MONDAY UPON WHICH CONSEQUENTLY DIAMOND COULD BE SPARED FROM THE BABY HIS FATHER TOOK HIM ON HIS OWN CAB
207-131203-0017 THEY DREW UP IN THE ROW UPON THE STAND BETWEEN COCKSPUR STREET AND PALL MALL THEY WAITED A LONG TIME BUT NOBODY SEEMED TO WANT TO BE CARRIED ANYWHERE BY AND BY LADIES WOULD BE GOING HOME FROM THE ACADEMY EXHIBITION AND THEN THERE WOULD BE A CHANCE OF A JOB
207-131203-0018 THOUGH TO BE SURE SAID DIAMOND'S FATHER WITH WHAT TRUTH I CANNOT SAY BUT HE BELIEVED WHAT HE SAID SOME LADIES IS VERY HARD AND KEEPS YOU TO THE BARE SIXPENCE A MILE WHEN EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT AIN'T ENOUGH TO KEEP A FAMILY AND A CAB UPON TO BE SURE IT'S THE LAW
207-131203-0019 BUT MAYHAP THEY MAY GET MORE LAW THAN THEY LIKE SOME DAY THEMSELVES
207-131203-0020 AND GIVE ANOTHER TO THE OLD WATERMAN HE LEFT DIAMOND ON THE BOX A SUDDEN NOISE GOT UP AND DIAMOND LOOKED ROUND TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER
207-131203-0021 SOME ROUGH YOUNG IMPS HAD PICKED A QUARREL WITH HER AND WERE NOW HAULING AT HER BROOM TO GET IT AWAY FROM HER BUT AS THEY DID NOT PULL ALL TOGETHER SHE WAS HOLDING IT AGAINST THEM SCOLDING AND ENTREATING ALTERNATELY DIAMOND WAS OFF HIS BOX IN A MOMENT AND RUNNING TO THE HELP OF THE GIRL
207-131203-0022 HE GOT HOLD OF THE BROOM AT HER END AND PULLED ALONG WITH HER BUT THE BOYS PROCEEDED TO ROUGHER MEASURES
207-131203-0023 BUT PRESENTLY HIS FATHER CAME BACK AND MISSING DIAMOND LOOKED ABOUT
207-131203-0024 HE RUSHED IN AND SENT THE ASSAILANTS FLYING IN ALL DIRECTIONS THE GIRL THANKED DIAMOND AND BEGAN SWEEPING AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED WHILE HIS FATHER LED HIM AWAY WITH THE HELP OF OLD TOM THE WATERMAN HE WAS SOON WASHED INTO DECENCY
207-131203-0025 PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH THE ACCOUNT HE GAVE OF THE CAUSE OF HIS BEING IN A FRAY I COULDN'T LET THEM BEHAVE SO TO A POOR GIRL COULD I FATHER HE SAID CERTAINLY NOT DIAMOND SAID HIS FATHER QUITE PLEASED FOR DIAMOND'S FATHER WAS A GENTLEMAN
207-131203-0026 DIAMOND'S FATHER TURNED INSTANTLY FOR HE WAS THE FOREMOST IN THE RANK AND FOLLOWED THE GIRL ONE OR TWO OTHER PASSING CABS HEARD THE CRY AND MADE FOR THE PLACE BUT THE GIRL HAD TAKEN CARE NOT TO CALL TILL SHE WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO GIVE HER FRIENDS THE FIRST CHANCE
207-131203-0027 WHEN THEY REACHED THE CURBSTONE WHO SHOULD IT BE WAITING FOR THE CAB BUT MISSUS AND MISS COLEMAN THEY DID NOT LOOK AT THE CABMAN HOWEVER
207-131203-0028 SHE TOLD THE CABMAN AND AWAY THEY DROVE WHEN THEY REACHED THE HOUSE DIAMOND'S FATHER GOT DOWN AND RANG THE BELL
207-131203-0029 WHY JOSEPH CAN IT BE YOU YES MA'AM YES MISS ANSWERED HE AGAIN TOUCHING HIS HAT WITH ALL THE RESPECT HE COULD POSSIBLY PUT INTO THE ACTION IT'S A LUCKY DAY WHICH I SEE YOU ONCE MORE UPON IT WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT SAID MISSUS COLEMAN
207-131203-0030 IT'S CHANGED TIMES FOR BOTH OF US JOSEPH AND IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN WE CAN HAVE A CAB EVEN
207-131203-0031 AND SHE CAN'T BEAR THE MOTION OF THE OMNIBUSES INDEED WE MEANT TO WALK A BIT FIRST BEFORE WE TOOK A CAB BUT JUST AT THE CORNER FOR AS HOT AS THE SUN WAS A COLD WIND CAME DOWN THE STREET AND I SAW THAT MISS COLEMAN MUST NOT FACE IT
207-131203-0032 I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD GOT A CAB WELL YOU SEE MA'AM I HAD A CHANCE OF BUYING THE OLD HORSE AND I COULDN'T RESIST HIM
207-131203-0033 NOBODY KNOWS THE SENSE IN THAT HEAD OF HIS THE TWO LADIES WENT NEAR TO PAT THE HORSE AND THEN THEY NOTICED DIAMOND ON THE BOX WHY YOU'VE GOT BOTH DIAMONDS WITH YOU SAID MISS COLEMAN HOW DO YOU DO DIAMOND DIAMOND LIFTED HIS CAP AND ANSWERED POLITELY
207-131203-0034 AND THEN MISSUS COLEMAN TOOK OUT HER PURSE SAYING AND WHAT'S YOUR FARE JOSEPH NO THANK YOU MA'AM SAID JOSEPH IT WAS YOUR OWN OLD HORSE AS TOOK YOU AND ME YOU PAID LONG AGO HE JUMPED ON HIS BOX BEFORE SHE COULD SAY ANOTHER WORD
207-131203-0035 AND DRAGGING HER BROOM AFTER HER AND FROM THAT BY DEGREES HE RECALLED THE WHOLE ADVENTURE OF THE NIGHT WHEN HE GOT DOWN FROM NORTH WIND'S BACK IN A LONDON STREET BUT HE COULD NOT QUITE SATISFY HIMSELF WHETHER THE WHOLE AFFAIR WAS NOT A DREAM WHICH HE HAD DREAMED WHEN HE WAS A VERY LITTLE BOY
207-131203-0036 HE RECALLED ANOTHER THING THAT HAD HAPPENED THAT MORNING WHICH ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED A MERE ACCIDENT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE
207-131203-0037 WHEN THEY FOUND THE WAY BLOCKED UP AND UPON INQUIRY WERE INFORMED THAT A STACK OF CHIMNEYS HAD BEEN BLOWN DOWN IN THE NIGHT
207-131203-0038 THEY WERE JUST CLEARING THE RUBBISH AWAY DIAMOND'S FATHER TURNED AND MADE FOR CHARING CROSS THAT NIGHT THE FATHER AND MOTHER HAD A GREAT DEAL TO TALK ABOUT POOR THINGS SAID THE MOTHER IT'S WORSE FOR THEM THAN IT IS FOR US
207-131203-0039 YOU SEE THEY'VE BEEN USED TO SUCH GRAND THINGS AND FOR THEM TO COME DOWN TO A LITTLE POKY HOUSE LIKE THAT IT BREAKS MY HEART TO THINK OF IT I DON'T KNOW SAID DIAMOND THOUGHTFULLY WHETHER MISSUS COLEMAN HAD BELLS ON HER TOES
