1417-1532-0011 BILLY WINDSOR STRETCHED OUT AN ARM AND PULLED A BUNDLE OF PAPERS FROM THE BOOK STAND HE TOSSED THEM ON TO THE SETTEE BY PSMITH'S SIDE THERE YOU ARE HE SAID IF YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE IT DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU IF YOU'VE GOT THE NERVE READ ON
1417-1532-0012 PSMITH HAD PICKED UP ONE OF THE PAPERS WHEN THERE CAME A SHUFFLING OF FEET IN THE PASSAGE OUTSIDE FOLLOWED BY A KNOCK UPON THE DOOR THE NEXT MOMENT THERE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY A SHORT STOUT YOUNG MAN
1417-1532-0013 THERE WAS AN INDESCRIBABLE AIR OF TOUGHNESS ABOUT HIM PARTLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT HE WORE HIS HAIR IN A WELL OILED FRINGE ALMOST DOWN TO HIS EYEBROWS WHICH GAVE HIM THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING NO FOREHEAD AT ALL HIS EYES WERE SMALL AND SET CLOSE TOGETHER
1417-1532-0014 WHICH ON ACQUAINTANCE PROVED TO BE A WHISTLED TUNE DURING THE INTERVIEW WHICH FOLLOWED EXCEPT WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING THE VISITOR WHISTLED SOFTLY AND UNCEASINGLY MISTER WINDSOR HE SAID TO THE COMPANY AT LARGE PSMITH WAVED A HAND TOWARDS THE ROCKING CHAIR
1417-1532-0015 THAT HE SAID IS COMRADE WINDSOR

1417-1532-0017 ARE YOU BAT JARVIS ASKED WINDSOR WITH INTEREST SURE SAID THE VISITOR NOT WITHOUT A TOUCH OF COMPLACENCY AS OF A MONARCH ABANDONING HIS INCOGNITO FOR MISTER JARVIS WAS A CELEBRITY
1417-1532-0018 BY PROFESSION HE WAS A DEALER IN ANIMALS BIRDS AND SNAKES HE HAD A FANCIER'S SHOP IN GROOME STREET IN THE HEART OF THE BOWERY THIS WAS ON THE GROUND FLOOR HIS LIVING ABODE WAS IN THE UPPER STORY OF THAT HOUSE
1417-1532-0019 AND WHOSE NUMBERS HAD SO RECENTLY BEEN REDUCED TO TWENTY TWO BUT IT WAS NOT THE FACT THAT HE POSSESSED TWENTY THREE CATS WITH LEATHER COLLARS THAT MADE MISTER JARVIS A CELEBRITY A MAN MAY WIN A PURELY LOCAL REPUTATION IF ONLY FOR ECCENTRICITY BY SUCH MEANS
1417-1532-0020 BUT MISTER JARVIS'S REPUTATION WAS FAR FROM BEING PURELY LOCAL BROADWAY KNEW HIM AND THE TENDERLOIN TAMMANY HALL KNEW HIM LONG ISLAND CITY KNEW HIM IN THE UNDERWORLD OF NEW YORK HIS NAME WAS A BY WORD
1417-1532-0021 FOR BAT JARVIS WAS THE LEADER OF THE FAMOUS GROOME STREET GANG THE MOST NOTED OF ALL NEW YORK'S COLLECTIONS OF APACHES MORE HE WAS THE FOUNDER AND ORIGINATOR OF IT AND CURIOUSLY ENOUGH IT HAD COME INTO BEING FROM MOTIVES OF SHEER BENEVOLENCE
1417-1532-0022 IN GROOME STREET IN THOSE DAYS THERE HAD BEEN A DANCE HALL NAMED THE SHAMROCK AND PRESIDED OVER BY ONE MAGINNIS AN IRISHMAN AND A FRIEND OF BAT'S AT THE SHAMROCK NIGHTLY DANCES WERE GIVEN AND WELL ATTENDED BY THE YOUTH OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AT TEN CENTS A HEAD
1417-1532-0023 ALL MIGHT HAVE BEEN WELL HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR CERTAIN OTHER YOUTHS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHO DID NOT DANCE AND SO HAD TO SEEK OTHER MEANS OF GETTING RID OF THEIR SURPLUS ENERGY IT WAS THE PRACTICE OF THESE LIGHT HEARTED SPORTSMEN TO PAY THEIR TEN CENTS FOR ADMITTANCE AND ONCE IN
1417-1532-0024 TO MAKE HAY AND THIS HABIT MISTER MAGINNIS FOUND WAS HAVING A MARKED EFFECT ON HIS EARNINGS FOR GENUINE LOVERS OF THE DANCE FOUGHT SHY OF A PLACE WHERE AT ANY MOMENT PHILISTINES MIGHT BURST IN AND BREAK HEADS AND FURNITURE
1417-1532-0025 BAT AT THAT TIME HAD A SOLID REPUTATION AS A MAN OF HIS HANDS
1417-1532-0026 A DEFECT WHICH HE HAD SUBSEQUENTLY CORRECTED BUT HIS ADMIRERS BASED HIS CLAIM TO RESPECT ON HIS MANY MERITORIOUS PERFORMANCES WITH FISTS AND WITH THE BLACK JACK AND MISTER MAGINNIS FOR ONE HELD HIM IN THE VERY HIGHEST ESTEEM
1417-1532-0027 TO BAT ACCORDINGLY HE WENT AND LAID HIS PAINFUL CASE BEFORE HIM
1417-1532-0028 BAT HAD ACCEPTED THE OFFER HE HAD GONE TO SHAMROCK HALL AND WITH HIM FAITHFUL ADHERENTS HAD GONE SUCH STALWARTS AS LONG OTTO RED LOGAN TOMMY JEFFERSON AND PETE BRODIE
1417-1532-0029 SHAMROCK HALL BECAME A PLACE OF JOY AND ORDER AND MORE IMPORTANT STILL THE NUCLEUS OF THE GROOME STREET GANG HAD BEEN FORMED THE WORK PROGRESSED OFF SHOOTS OF THE MAIN GANG SPRANG UP HERE AND THERE ABOUT THE EAST SIDE
1417-1532-0030 SMALL THIEVES PICKPOCKETS AND THE LIKE FLOCKED TO MISTER JARVIS AS THEIR TRIBAL LEADER AND PROTECTOR AND HE PROTECTED THEM
1417-1532-0031 WERE OF USE TO THE POLITICIANS THE NEW YORK GANGS AND ESPECIALLY THE GROOME STREET GANG HAVE BROUGHT TO A FINE ART THE GENTLE PRACTICE OF REPEATING WHICH BROADLY SPEAKING IS THE ART OF VOTING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TIMES AT DIFFERENT POLLING STATIONS ON ELECTION DAYS
1417-1532-0032 A MAN WHO CAN VOTE SAY TEN TIMES IN A SINGLE DAY FOR YOU AND WHO CONTROLS A GREAT NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS WHO ARE ALSO PREPARED IF THEY LIKE YOU TO VOTE TEN TIMES IN A SINGLE DAY FOR YOU IS WORTH CULTIVATING SO THE POLITICIANS PASSED THE WORD TO THE POLICE
1417-1532-0033 AND THE POLICE LEFT THE GROOME STREET GANG UNMOLESTED AND THEY WAXED FAT AND FLOURISHED SUCH WAS BAT JARVIS PIPE DE COLLAR SAID MISTER JARVIS TOUCHING THE CAT'S NECK MINE MISTER PUGSY SAID IT MUST BE SAID BILLY WINDSOR

1417-1532-0039 THEN HE TURNED TO BILLY AGAIN SAY HE SAID ANY TIME YOU'RE IN BAD GLAD TO BE OF SERVICE YOU KNOW THE ADDRESS GROOME STREET BAT JARVIS GOOD NIGHT OBLIGED HE PAUSED AND WHISTLED A FEW MORE BARS
1417-1532-0040 BILLY WINDSOR LAUGHED I DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S JUST THE SORT OF SIDE PARTNER I'D GO OUT OF MY WAY TO CHOOSE FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT HIM STILL
1417-1532-0041 I GUESS THERE'S NO HARM DONE BY GETTING HIM GRATEFUL
