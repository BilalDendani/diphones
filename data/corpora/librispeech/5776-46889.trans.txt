5776-46889-0000 THE GLASS FELL SLOWLY TOO AND THERE APPEARED TO BE EVERY PROSPECT OF OUR GETTING A TASTE OF THE QUALITY OF THE WEATHER FOR WHICH CAPE HORN IS SO NOTORIOUS AS THE SUN SET
5776-46889-0001 AND WE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE GREAT LUMINARY HANGING UPON THE VERGE OF THE HORIZON LIKE A BALL OF MOLTEN COPPER HIS LEVEL BEAMS SHOT FOR A FEW MOMENTS ACROSS THE BROAD EXPANSE OF THE HEAVING AND WILDLY LEAPING WATERS
5776-46889-0002 A FEW RAYS SHOT UPWARD GLEAMING WILDLY AMONG THE FLYING SCUD AND THEN THE ORB OF DAY SANK INTO THE OCEAN SHOOTING ABROAD AS HE DID SO
5776-46889-0003 BOB STOOD BY MY SIDE WATCHING THE WILD SCENE I HAVE SO FEEBLY DESCRIBED AND AS THE SUN DISAPPEARED HE TURNED TO ME AND REMARKED MY EYES HARRY
5776-46889-0004 THAT WE'RE BOOKED FOR A REG'LAR THOROUGH BRED CAPE HORN GALE OF WIND AND MY ADVICE AS CHIEF MATE OF THIS HERE BARKIE IS THAT WE MAKES HER JUST AS SNUG AS WE KNOWS HOW FOR DEPEND UPON IT AFORE MORNING
5776-46889-0005 MY OWN IDEA BOB REPLIED I I HAVE SELDOM SEEN A WILDER SUNSET AND IF IT DOES NOT MEAN WIND AND PLENTY OF IT TOO ALL MY WEATHER LORE MUST GO FOR NOTHING
5776-46889-0006 AY AY YOU MAY SAY THAT RETURNED HE AND I THE SAME
5776-46889-0007 THANK GOD WE'VE PLENTY OF SEA ROOM
5776-46889-0008 THIS FLOATING ANCHOR I WILL DESCRIBE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO MAY NOT HAVE SEEN SUCH A THING FOR IT IS A MOST USEFUL AFFAIR AND NO SMALL CRAFT SHOULD UNDERTAKE A LONG CRUISE WITHOUT ONE OURS WAS FORMED OF TWO FLAT BARS OF IRON
5776-46889-0009 EACH TEN FEET IN LENGTH RIVETED TOGETHER IN THE CENTRE IN SUCH A WAY
5776-46889-0010 SO AS TO KEEP THEM SPREAD AT RIGHT ANGLES
5776-46889-0011 TWO IN EACH BAR ABOUT MIDWAY BETWEEN EACH END AND THE CENTRE RIVET
5776-46889-0012 AS SOON AS THE BARS WERE SPREAD OPEN AND THE SWIFTER PASSED AND SET UP A SQUARE SHEET OF THE STOUTEST CANVAS PAINTED WAS SPREAD OVER THEM THE EDGES LACED TO THE SWIFTER WITH A STOUT LACING
5776-46889-0013 WITH A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF BUOY ROPE TO ALLOW IT TO SINK TO THE REQUISITE DEPTH
5776-46889-0014 THE BUOY STREAMED OVERBOARD AND THE ANCHOR LET GO I MAY AS WELL STATE HERE THAT FOR THE ECONOMISATION OF SPACE THE BUOY FOR FLOATING OUT ANCHOR WAS AN INDIA RUBBER BALL MADE OF THE SAME MATERIALS AS AN ORDINARY AIR CUSHION
5776-46889-0015 AND DISTENDED IN THE SAME WAY THIS WAS ENCLOSED IN A STRONG NET OF THREE STRAND SINNET WHICH NET WAS ATTACHED TO THE BUOY ROPE WE HOVE THE CRAFT TO WHILST WE WERE PREPARING THE ANCHOR
5776-46889-0016 THAT I WAS AFRAID ONCE OR TWICE WHEN WE WERE CAUGHT BROADSIDE TO THAT WE SHOULD BE CAPSIZED WE LET GO THE ANCHOR WITH ONLY TWO FATHOMS OF BUOY ROPE SO AS TO SINK IT JUST DEEP ENOUGH TO KEEP US HEAD TO SEA WITHOUT MATERIALLY INTERFERING WITH THE CRAFT'S DRIFT
5776-46889-0017 AS WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD RIDE ALL THE EASIER FOR SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT AND SO IT PROVED AS SOON AS THE ANCHOR WAS LET GO WE GOT OUR HEAD SAIL IN RAN IN THE BOWSPRIT AND GOT OUR TOPMAST ON DECK
5776-46889-0018 THE TRYSAIL WAS CLOSE REEFED AND THE SHEET TRIMMED AMIDSHIPS THE ANCHOR LIGHT HOISTED WELL UP ON THE FORE STAY AND OUR PREPARATIONS FOR THE NIGHT WERE COMPLETE BY THIS TIME IT WAS BLOWING TREMENDOUSLY HEAVY AND THE HOWLING OF THE GALE OVERHEAD
5776-46889-0019 MINGLED INTO SUCH A DEAFENING SOUND THAT BOB AND I HAD FAIRLY TO SHOUT
5776-46889-0020 AT ONE MOMENT ALL WOULD BE DEEP BLACK PITCHY NIGHT LIGHTED UP ONLY BY THE PALE UNEARTHLY SHIMMER OF SOME FOAMING WAVE CREST AS IT ROLLED MENACINGLY DOWN UPON US GLEAMING WITH PHOSPHORESCENT LIGHT
5776-46889-0021 ANON THE CANOPY ABOVE WOULD BE RENT ASUNDER
5776-46889-0022 THE TORN AND SHREDDED CLOUDS WOULD BE REVEALED WITH A MOMENTARY VISION OF THE WRITHING LEAPING AND STORM DRIVEN WATERS BENEATH THEM ILLUMINED BY THE GHASTLY GLARE OF THE LEVIN BRAND
5776-46889-0023 ANCHOR WAS LET GO WATCHING THIS GRAND MANIFESTATION OF THE POWER OF THE DEITY SUBLIME AS TERRIBLE TERRIBLE AS SUBLIME AND THEN FINDING THAT NO IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTED ITSELF IN OUR ARRANGEMENTS
5776-46889-0024 AND OUT OVER HER TAFFRAIL WE DESCENDED TO THE CABIN TO GET OUR SUPPERS FOR WHICH BY THIS TIME WE WERE QUITE READY SO EASY WAS THE MOTION OF THE LITTLE CRAFT
5776-46889-0025 AND THAT WE WOULD THEREFORE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A GOOD UNDISTURBED NIGHT'S REST LEAVING THE SWEET LITTLE CHERUB THAT SITS UP ALOFT TO LOOK OUT ACCORDINGLY AS SOON AS OUR MEAL WAS OVER I LEFT BOB TO STRAIGHTEN UP BELOW WHILE I WENT ON DECK TO TAKE
5776-46889-0026 AND OUR LIGHT BURNING BRIGHTLY
5776-46889-0027 HOWEVER I COULD NOT HELP THAT SO I WENT BELOW AGAIN CLOSING THE COMPANION AFTER ME AND WE BOTH TURNED IN CHATTED AWHILE
5776-46889-0028 AND FINALLY DROPPED OFF TO SLEEP I AWOKE TWO OR THREE TIMES DURING THE NIGHT AND ONCE I
5776-46889-0029 AND THE AIR WAS FULL OF SPINDRIFT AND SCUD WATER
5776-46889-0030 AGAIN AND TUMBLED ONCE MORE INTO MY COMFORTABLE HAMMOCK
5776-46889-0031 AND ALSO WITH THE COMPARATIVE DEGREES OF COMFORT BETWEEN THE DECKS AND THE CABIN BOB WAS THE FIRST TO MAKE A MUSTER IN THE MORNING
5776-46889-0032 BLOWING HARD ENOUGH TO BLOW THE DEVIL'S HORNS OFF I HEARD HIM EXCLAIM
5776-46889-0033 AND MY PRECIOUS EYES WHAT A SEA
5776-46889-0034 HURRAH YOUNG UN THAT'S YOUR SORT
5776-46889-0035 AND THEN SLID DOWN DOWN DOWN INTO THE TROUGH UNTIL IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SHE WOULD SINK TO THE VERY OCEAN'S BED AND DON'T THE LITTLE HUSSY BEHAVE BEAUTIFULLY SHE'S AS FLOATY AS A GULL HAL AND DRIER THAN E'ER A SEVENTY FOUR
5776-46889-0036 THAT EVER WAS LAUNCHED WOULD BE IN A SEA LIKE THIS NOW WHAT LUBBER COMES HERE WITH HIS EYES SEALED UP INSTEAD OF LOOKING BEFORE HIM JUMP UP HARRY QUICK BOY WE ARE IN A MESS HERE AND NO MISTAKE NO NO IT'S ALL RIGHT
5776-46889-0037 AND SAW WITHIN FORTY FATHOMS OF US OVER THE RIDGE OF A SEA
5776-46889-0038 SHE WAS NOT A LARGE VESSEL ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TONS OR THEREABOUTS APPARENTLY PAINTED ALL BLACK DOWN TO HER COPPER EXCEPTING A NARROW RED RIBBON WHICH MARKED THE LINE OF HER SHEER SHE WAS HOVE TO ON THE PORT TACK
5776-46889-0039 UNDER A STORM STAYSAIL AND HER TOPGALLANT MASTS WERE DOWN ON DECK EVERYTHING WAS VERY TRIM AND MAN O' WARLIKE ON BOARD HER BUT NO GOVERNMENT DOCKYARD EVER TURNED OUT SUCH A BEAUTIFUL MODEL AS SHE WAS
5776-46889-0040 WHEN I FIRST CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER SHE WAS HEADING DIRECTLY FOR US BUT AS WE WATCHED HER
5776-46889-0041 SOME TEN OR A DOZEN HEADS PEERED CURIOUSLY AT US OVER HER WEATHER BULWARKS AS SHE
5776-46889-0042 SEIZED A TRUMPET TO HAIL US BUT WHETHER HE DID SO OR NOT OR IF HE DID WHAT HE SAID
5776-46889-0043 ONCE MORE INTO THE TROUGH WITH A PERFECT MOUNTAIN OF WATER BETWEEN US
5776-46889-0044 OPEN AND ADJUSTED READY FOR IMMEDIATE USE
5776-46889-0045 AND THE FIRST THING WHICH CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WAS HER NAME PAINTED ON HER STERN WHICH WAS NOW TOWARDS US
5776-46889-0046 SHE WAS TOSSED ABOUT LIKE THE MEREST COCKLE SHELL AND EVERY TIME THAT SHE ROSE UPON THE CREST OF A SEA THE WIND TOOK HER RAG OF A STAYSAIL DISTENDING IT AS THOUGH IT WOULD TEAR IT CLEAN OUT OF THE BOLT ROPES
5776-46889-0047 AND HEELING THE VESSEL OVER UNTIL WE COULD SEE THE WHOLE OF HER BOTTOM NEARLY DOWN TO HER KEEL AND THEN HER SHARP BOWS WOULD CLEAVE THE WAVE CREST IN A PERFECT CATARACT OF FOAM AND SPRAY
5776-46889-0048 AND AWAY SHE WOULD SETTLE DOWN ONCE MORE WITH A HEAVY WEATHER ROLL INTO THE TROUGH WELL EXCLAIMED BOB AS WE LOST SIGHT OF HER IN THE DRIVING SCUD SHE'S A PRETTY SEA BOAT IS YON BRIG
5776-46889-0049 I AM AS SURPRISED AS I AM DELIGHTED AT HER BEHAVIOUR I COULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED WITHOUT SEEING IT MYSELF THAT SO SMALL A CRAFT WOULD EVEN LIVE IN SUCH WEATHER
5776-46889-0050 SHAKING HER FEATHERS LIKE A DUCK I'M AFRAID
5776-46889-0051 NEVER FEAR RETURNED BOB CONFIDENTLY OUR BIT OF A WINDLASS AND THE MAST BREAKS THE FORCE OF IT BEFORE IT REACHES THE SKYLIGHT
5776-46889-0052 ALMOST LIKE THE STEM OF A SHIP BESIDES BEIN STRONGER THAN A SQUARE SHAPED CONSARN
5776-46889-0053 BUT HOW'S IT TO BE PERVENTED I HAVE AN IDEA SAID I AND IT'S WORTH A TRIAL
5776-46889-0054 SO SAYING I DIVED BELOW AND GOT OUT A BOTTLE OF OIL
5776-46889-0055 OR FOUR HOLES WITH A CORKSCREW BUT LEFT THE CORK IN
5776-46889-0056 AND THEN GOING FORWARD I MADE FAST THE OTHER END OF THE MARLINE TO ONE OF THE LINKS OF THE CHAIN CABLE BY WHICH WE WERE RIDING TO OUR FLOATING ANCHOR I THEN SUNG OUT TO BOB
5776-46889-0057 AND AS HE DID SO I HOVE THE BOTTLE OVERBOARD
5776-46889-0058 EITHER WITHOUT BREAKING AT ALL OR IF THEY DID BREAK IT WAS WITH SUCH DIMINISHED FORCE THAT NO MORE WATER CAME ON BOARD I HAD HEARD
5776-46889-0059 SO THOROUGHLY PRACTICAL A TEST
5776-46889-0060 UNDER WEIGH AND WHILST DISCUSSING THE MEAL OUR CONVERSATION NATURALLY TURNED UPON THE APPEARANCE OF THE ALBATROSS THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION I FEAR
5776-46889-0061 JOHNSON AND HIS GANG OF DESPERADOES SAID I
5776-46889-0062 BUT HE WAS QUITE OF MY OPINION NO NO SAID HE
5776-46889-0063 I NOTICED THE NAME ON HIS STARN
5776-46889-0064 FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT HE HAILS FROM NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR BESIDES A MAN WITH HALF AN EYE COULD TELL BY LOOKING AT THAT CRAFT THAT SHE'S STRONG HANDED
5776-46889-0065 AND WORST LUCK SHE'S BOUND THE SAME ROAD AS OURSELVES
5776-46889-0066 OTHER COMING DOWN THE COAST FOR IF WE FALLS IN WITH HER AG'IN
5776-46889-0067 AS OURSELVES A THOUGHT DO YOU THAT'S JUST WHAT HE'S
5776-46889-0068 HE IS NOT FOOL ENOUGH TO SUPPOSE WE'RE DOWN HERE SOMEWHERES OFF THE HORN IN THIS COCKLE SHELL ON A PLEASURE TRIP AND THAT WE'RE NOT COME DOWN HERE TO TRADE
5776-46889-0069 OR WE SHOULD HAVE A CRAFT BIG ENOUGH TO STOW AWAY SOMETHING LIKE A PAYING CARGO AND IF WE'RE HERE
5776-46889-0070 HE'LL WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE ARE HERE FOR AND DEPEND UPON IT
5776-46889-0071 AND IF WE FALL IN WITH HIM AGAIN LET'S GIVE HIM A WIDE BERTH
5776-46889-0072 BUT GIVE US WEATHER IN WHICH WE CAN CARRY A TOPSAIL EVEN IF IT'S NO
5776-46889-0073 THAN HE CAN AND STILL KEEP A GOOD CLEAN FULL AND THE SQUARE RIGGED CRAFT THAT CAN BEAT US IN GOING TO WIND'ARD MUST BE AN OUT AND OUT FLYER AND NO MISTAKE WE MUST KEEP A
5776-46889-0074 BRIGHT LOOK OUT AND NOT BE CAUGHT NAPPING THAT'S ALL AND GIVE EVERYTHING A GOOD WIDE BERTH
5776-46889-0075 I TRUST WE SHALL NOT FALL IN WITH HIM AGAIN THE PACIFIC IS A PRETTY BIG PLACE
5776-46889-0076 IF WE DO MEET WITH HIM AGAIN WE MUST DO ALL WE CAN TO AVOID HIM AND HOPE FOR THE BEST AY AY RETURNED BOB HOPE FOR THE BEST AND PREPARE FOR THE WORST IS A GOOD MAXIM FOR ANY MAN
5776-46889-0077 AND WITH SLACK BOWLINES AS FOR THIS HERE JOHNSON I'D ASK NOTHING BETTER THAN TO HAVE HIM JUST OUT OF GUN SHOT UNDER OUR LEE WITH A NICE BREEZE AND NOT TOO MUCH SEA FOR THE LITTLE LILY AND THEN LET HIM CATCH US IF HE'S MAN ENOUGH FOR THE JOB
5776-46889-0078 OF BOB'S BUT IT WAS SATISFACTORY TO FIND THAT HE HAD SUCH GREAT CONFIDENCE IN THE BOAT
5776-46889-0079 ESPECIALLY AS IT SEEMED TO AFFORD HIM CONSIDERABLE ENTERTAINMENT AND WENT ON DECK TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE WEATHER THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE GALE BREAKING IN FACT
5776-46889-0080 AND THE SEA WAS SOMETHING AWFUL TO CONTEMPLATE IT LOOKED OF COURSE WORSE TO US THAN IT
5776-46889-0081 ALLOWING FOR THAT IT WAS UNQUESTIONABLY RUNNING FAR HIGHER THAN ANYTHING I HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE I HAVE READ SOMEWHERE THAT SCIENTIFIC MEN ASSERT THAT EVEN IN THE HEAVIEST GALES AND IN MID OCEAN THE SEA NEVER ATTAINS A GREATER HEIGHT
5776-46889-0082 THAN TWENTY FEET FROM TROUGH TO CREST BUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THEM AND THEIR SCIENCE FOUNDED OPINIONS I TAKE LEAVE TO ASSERT THAT THEY ARE IN THIS INSTANCE MISTAKEN AN INTELLIGENT SAILOR AND I MODESTLY CLAIM TO BE AT LEAST THIS MUCH
5776-46889-0083 OF MORTALS AND I AM CONFIDENT OF THIS
5776-46889-0084 INDEED TO SATISFY MYSELF THOROUGHLY UPON THIS POINT I CLIMBED SO HIGH WITH THE UTMOST DIFFICULTY AND AT VERY GREAT RISK OF BEING BLOWN OVERBOARD AND WHILST LOOKING OVER THE CROSS TREES I SAW THE CREST OF MORE THAN ONE SEA
5776-46889-0085 REARING ITSELF BETWEEN MY EYE AND THE HORIZON SO FAR THE WATER LILY HAD WEATHERED THE GALE SCATHELESS
5776-46889-0086 AND AS THERE SEEMED TO BE NO GREATER DANGER THAN THERE HAD BEEN THROUGH THE NIGHT AND AS I HAD TAKEN A GOOD LOOK ROUND WHEN ALOFT WITHOUT SEEING ANYTHING WE BOTH WENT BELOW TO ENJOY THE COMFORT OF THE CABIN
5776-46889-0087 FOR ON DECK EVERYTHING WAS COLD WET AND DISMAL IN THE EXTREME I WAS ANXIOUS TO GET A SIGHT OF THE SUN AT NOON IF POSSIBLE
5776-46889-0088 TO THE SOUTHWARD OF STATEN AND I
5776-46889-0089 IN WHICH CASE WE MIGHT FIND OURSELVES VERY AWKWARDLY SITUATED IT LOOKED HALF INCLINED TO BREAK AWAY TWO OR THREE TIMES DURING THE MORNING BUT AS MID DAY APPROACHED IT BECAME AS BAD AS EVER AND I HAD THE VEXATION
5776-46889-0090 TOWARDS EVENING THEREFORE
5776-46889-0091 AND ESPECIALLY TO THE NORTHWARD THERE WAS NOTHING IN SIGHT AND WITH THIS I WAS OBLIGED TO REST SATISFIED WE NOTICED JUST ABOUT THIS TIME THAT THE SEAS WERE BEGINNING TO BREAK ON BOARD AGAIN SO I CONCLUDED THAT OUR BOTTLE OF OIL WAS EXHAUSTED
5776-46889-0092 AND ACCORDINGLY GOT OUT ANOTHER AND HAVING BORED HOLES IN THE CORK
5776-46889-0093 MORE CABLE PAID OUT AND WE AGAIN RODE ALL THE EASIER OUR ANCHOR LIGHT WAS TRIMMED AND LIGHTED AND HOISTED UP AND WE WENT BELOW TO OUR TEA OR SUPPER AS SAILORS GENERALLY TERM IT WE HAD FOUND THE DAY
5776-46889-0094 DREADFULLY TEDIOUS COOPED UP AS WE WERE IN OUR LOW CABIN
5776-46889-0095 A MOST WELCOME BREAK IN THE MONOTONY WE SAT LONG OVER THIS ONE THEREFORE PROLONGING IT TO ITS UTMOST EXTENT
5776-46889-0096 TO AND CLEARED UP THE WRECK BY THE TIME THAT ALL WAS DONE IT WAS INTENSELY DARK BUT BEFORE SETTLING DOWN BELOW FOR THE NIGHT WE BOTH PUT OUR HEADS UP THROUGH THE COMPANION TO TAKE A LAST LOOK ROUND
5776-46889-0097 THAN HE PULLED IT IN AGAIN EXCLAIMING IN AN AWE STRUCK TONE LOOK HERE HARRY WHAT D'YE THINK OF THIS
5776-46889-0098 WAS A GLOBE OF PALE SICKLY GREEN LIGHT
5776-46889-0099 TOSSED WILDLY OVER THE MOUNTAINOUS SEAS
5776-46889-0100 BRILLIANT AT THE CORE AND SOFTENING OFF AND BECOMING MORE DIM AS THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE GLOBE WAS REACHED
5776-46889-0101 AND UNEARTHLY LIGHT OF NO GREAT POWER I HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A THING BEFORE BUT I HAD OFTEN HEARD OF IT AND I RECOGNISED OUR STRANGE VISITORS AT ONCE AS CORPOSANTS OR LAMPS OF SAINT ELMO
5776-46889-0102 WHAT D'YE THINK OF BEIN BOARDED BY THE LIKES OF THAT AGAIN QUERIED BOB IN A HOARSE WHISPER OLD DAVY IS OUT ON A CRUISE TO NIGHT I RECKON
5776-46889-0103 LANTERNS OF HIS'N IN OUR RIGGING DID YE EVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE IT AFORE HARRY LAD NEVER REPLIED I BUT I HAVE OFTEN HEARD THEM SPOKEN OF OLD MAN AND THOUGH THEY CERTAINLY ARE RATHER QUEER TO LOOK AT THEY ARE EASILY ACCOUNTED FOR
5776-46889-0104 AT THE MOMENT THAT BOB SPOKE BUT WERE NOW SETTLING INTO THE TROUGH AS
5776-46889-0105 SHE WAS FEARFULLY CLOSE BUT APPEARED TO BE AT THE MOMENT SHEERING AWAY FROM US SHE LOOKED LONG ENOUGH
5776-46889-0106 OR WHAT I THOUGHT MORE PROBABLE
5776-46889-0107 AS IT WERE UNTIL IT APPEARED AS THOUGH THE FOLLOWING WAVE WOULD RUN CLEAN OVER HER BUT GRADUALLY
5776-46889-0108 WHILST HER BOW IN ITS TURN SEEMED WEIGHED DOWN
5776-46889-0109 BUT POOR CHAPS IT'S LITTLE OF THAT WE CAN GIVE EM
5776-46889-0110 AS HE SPOKE THE SHIP WHICH WAS RUSHING FORWARD FURIOUSLY ON THE BACK OF A SEA SUDDENLY SHEERED WILDLY TO PORT UNTIL SHE LAY BROADSIDE TO THE CREST OF THE SEA OVERTOOK HER AND BREAKING ON BOARD HER
5776-46889-0111 IN ONE VAST VOLUME OF WILDLY FLASHING FOAM
5776-46889-0112 GAZED IN SPEECHLESS HORROR AT THE DREADFUL CATASTROPHE A LOUD PIERCING SHRIEK RANG OUT CLEAR
5776-46889-0113 SHE ROLLED COMPLETELY BOTTOM UPWARDS AND THEN DISAPPEARED BROACHED TO AND CAPSIZED EJACULATED WE BOTH IN THE SAME BREATH
5776-46889-0114 COLLECT MY SCATTERED FACULTIES IN AN INSTANT I HAD ALL FOUR OF THE BUOYS READY
5776-46889-0115 I COULD LAY MY HANDS ON AND IN ANOTHER THAT GLORIOUS BOB APPEARED WITH A COIL OF RATLINE ON HIS SHOULDER AND A LIGHTED BLUE LIGHT IN HIS HAND THE STOPS WERE CUT AND THE ENDS OF THE COIL CLEARED IN NO TIME AND THE TWO REMAINING BUOYS BENT ON
5776-46889-0116 FOR THE DOUBLE PURPOSE OF THROWING THE LIGHT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE OVER THE WATER AND ALSO TO INDICATE OUR WHEREABOUTS TO ANY STRONG SWIMMER WHO MIGHT BE STRUGGLING FOR HIS LIFE AMONG THE MOUNTAIN SURGES
5776-46889-0117 IN THE HOPE OF SEEING SOME POOR SOUL
5776-46889-0118 THAT THE VESSEL SUCKED ALL HANDS DOWN WITH HER WHEN SHE SANK INTO HER WATERY GRAVE WHEN AT LAST WE RELUCTANTLY DESISTED FROM OUR EFFORTS AND WERE IN THE ACT OF SECURING THE LIFEBUOYS ONCE MORE BOB CAST HIS EYES ALOFT
5776-46889-0119 DEPEND ON'T HARRY QUOTH HE
5776-46889-0120 BUT YOU SEE THEY DID MEAN MISCHIEF AND PLENTY OF IT TOO
5776-46889-0121 I MAKE NO MANNER OF DOUBT IT WAS UTTERLY IN VAIN THAT I ATTEMPTED TO ARGUE THE HONEST FELLOW OUT OF HIS BELIEF
5776-46889-0122 FOR HIS MIND WAS DEEPLY IMBUED WITH ALL THOSE SUPERSTITIOUS NOTIONS WHICH APPEAR TO TAKE SUCH PECULIARLY FIRM HOLD ON THE IDEAS OF SAILORS
5776-46889-0123 AS MAY READILY BE BELIEVED OUR SLUMBERS THAT NIGHT AFTER WITNESSING SO DISTRESSING A SCENE WERE ANYTHING BUT SOUND BOB AND I WERE UP AND DOWN BETWEEN THE DECK AND THE CABIN AT LEAST HALF A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE MORNING
5776-46889-0124 WE FOUND THAT THE GALE WAS BREAKING ALSO BY THE TIME THAT BREAKFAST WAS OVER THERE WAS A SENSIBLE DIMINUTION IN THE FORCE OF THE WIND
5776-46889-0125 NOT A PARTICULARLY GOOD ONE CERTAINLY THE SEA WAS RUNNING FAR TOO HIGH FOR THAT
5776-46889-0126 SIXTY MILES TO THE SOUTHWARD OF STATEN ABOUT FOUR P M
5776-46889-0127 BY IT THAT OUR DRIFT HAD NOT BEEN ANYTHING LIKE SO GREAT AS I HAD CALCULATED IT WOULD BE
5776-46889-0128 SETTING CURRENT THERE WAS STILL RATHER TOO MUCH OF BOTH WIND AND SEA TO MAKE US DISPOSED TO GET UNDER WAY THAT NIGHT
5776-46889-0129 TO THE BUOY OF OUR FLOATING ANCHOR WHICH WE WEIGHED AND
5776-46889-0130 AND TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE CURRENT THE EXISTENCE OF WHICH WE SUSPECTED
