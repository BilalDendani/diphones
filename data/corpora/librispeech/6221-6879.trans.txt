6221-6879-0000 THE LEADS USED FOR THE CONFINEMENT OF STATE PRISONERS ARE IN FACT THE LOFTS OF THE DUCAL PALACE AND TAKE THEIR NAME FROM THE LARGE PLATES OF LEAD WITH WHICH THE ROOF IS COVERED ONE CAN ONLY REACH THEM THROUGH THE GATES OF THE PALACE THE PRISON BUILDINGS
6221-6879-0001 AND THEIR SECRETARY HAS THE SOLE CHARGE OF THE KEY
6221-6879-0002 WHILST HE IS ATTENDING TO THE PRISONERS THIS IS DONE AT DAY BREAK BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE GUARDS AS THEY CAME AND WENT WOULD BE IN THE WAY OF THOSE WHO HAVE TO DO WITH THE COUNCIL OF TEN AS THE COUNCIL MEETS EVERY DAY IN A HALL CALLED THE BUSSOLA WHICH THE GUARDS HAVE TO CROSS EVERY TIME THEY GO TO THE LEADS
6221-6879-0003 THE PRISONS ARE UNDER THE ROOF ON TWO SIDES OF THE PALACE THREE TO THE WEST MINE BEING AMONG THE NUMBER AND FOUR TO THE EAST ON THE WEST THE ROOF LOOKS INTO THE COURT OF THE PALACE AND ON THE EAST STRAIGHT ON TO THE CANAL CALLED RIO DI PALAZZO
6221-6879-0004 ON THIS SIDE THE CELLS ARE WELL LIGHTED AND ONE CAN STAND UP STRAIGHT WHICH IS NOT THE CASE IN THE PRISON WHERE I WAS
6221-6879-0005 ON ACCOUNT OF THE ENORMOUS BEAM WHICH DEPRIVED ME OF LIGHT THE FLOOR OF MY CELL WAS DIRECTLY OVER THE CEILING OF THE INQUISITORS HALL
6221-6879-0006 OF WHICH THE WHOLE THREE ARE MEMBERS AS I KNEW MY GROUND AND THE HABITS OF THE INQUISITORS PERFECTLY WELL THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE THE ONLY WAY AT LEAST WHICH I DEEMED LIKELY TO SUCCEED WAS TO MAKE A HOLE IN THE FLOOR OF MY CELL BUT TO DO THIS TOOLS MUST BE OBTAINED
6221-6879-0007 A DIFFICULT TASK IN A PLACE WHERE ALL COMMUNICATION WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD WAS FORBIDDEN
6221-6879-0008 TO BRIBE A GUARD A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY WOULD BE NECESSARY AND I HAD NONE
6221-6879-0009 FOR MY HANDS WERE MY ONLY WEAPONS THERE WAS ALWAYS A THIRD GUARD ON DUTY AT THE DOOR OF THE PASSAGE WHICH HE LOCKED AND WOULD NOT OPEN TILL HIS FELLOW WHO WISHED TO PASS THROUGH GAVE HIM THE PASSWORD IN SPITE OF ALL THESE DIFFICULTIES MY ONLY THOUGHT WAS HOW TO ESCAPE
6221-6879-0010 AND AS I WAS CERTAIN THAT THE DIFFICULTY WAS ONLY TO BE SOLVED BY STRESS OF THINKING
6221-6879-0011 AND THINKS OF NOUGHT BUT HIS DESIGN HE MUST SUCCEED DESPITE ALL DIFFICULTIES IN HIS PATH SUCH AN ONE MAY MAKE HIMSELF POPE OR GRAND VIZIER HE MAY OVERTURN AN ANCIENT LINE OF KINGS PROVIDED THAT HE KNOWS HOW TO SEIZE ON HIS OPPORTUNITY AND BE A MAN OF WIT AND PERTINACITY
6221-6879-0012 TO SUCCEED ONE MUST COUNT ON BEING FORTUNATE AND DESPISE ALL ILL SUCCESS BUT IT IS A MOST DIFFICULT OPERATION
6221-6879-0013 BUSINELLO HAD ORDERED TO BE PLACED IN THE WORST CELL AND WHO CONSEQUENTLY WAS GOING TO SHARE MINE HE TOLD ME THAT ON THE SECRETARY'S REMINDING HIM THAT I LOOKED UPON IT AS A FAVOUR TO BE LEFT ALONE HE ANSWERED THAT I HAD GROWN WISER IN THE FOUR MONTHS OF MY IMPRISONMENT
6221-6879-0014 I WAS NOT SORRY TO HEAR THE NEWS OR THAT THERE WAS A NEW SECRETARY
6221-6879-0015 HE AFTERWARDS WENT TO LONDON AS AMBASSADOR OF THE REPUBLIC IN THE AFTERNOON I HEARD THE NOISE OF THE BOLTS AND PRESENTLY LAWRENCE AND TWO GUARDS ENTERED LEADING IN A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS WEEPING BITTERLY AND AFTER TAKING OFF HIS HANDCUFFS THEY SHUT HIM UP WITH ME
6221-6879-0016 AND WENT OUT WITHOUT SAYING A WORD I WAS LYING ON MY BED AND HE COULD NOT SEE ME I WAS AMUSED AT HIS ASTONISHMENT BEING FORTUNATELY FOR HIMSELF SEVEN OR EIGHT INCHES SHORTER THAN I
6221-6879-0017 AND HE BEGAN TO INSPECT MY ARM CHAIR WHICH HE DOUBTLESS THOUGHT WAS MEANT FOR HIS OWN USE GLANCING AT THE LEDGE ABOVE THE GRATING HE SAW BOETHIUS TOOK IT UP OPENED IT AND PUT IT DOWN WITH A KIND OF PASSION PROBABLY BECAUSE BEING IN LATIN IT WAS OF NO USE TO HIM
6221-6879-0018 AND GROPING ABOUT WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO FIND CLOTHES HE APPROACHED THE RECESS AND STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND HE TOUCHED ME AND IMMEDIATELY BEGGED MY PARDON IN A RESPECTFUL MANNER I ASKED HIM TO SIT DOWN AND WE WERE FRIENDS WHO ARE YOU SAID I
6221-6879-0019 MY FATHER WHO WAS A COACHMAN KEPT ME AT SCHOOL TILL I WAS ELEVEN BY WHICH TIME I HAD LEARNT TO READ AND WRITE I WAS AFTERWARDS APPRENTICED TO A BARBER
6221-6879-0020 AFTER THAT I BECAME VALET TO THE COUNT OF X I HAD BEEN IN THE SERVICE OF THE NOBLEMAN FOR TWO YEARS WHEN HIS DAUGHTER CAME FROM THE CONVENT IT WAS MY DUTY TO DO HER HAIR AND BY DEGREES I FELL IN LOVE WITH HER AND INSPIRED HER WITH A RECIPROCAL PASSION
6221-6879-0021 AFTER HAVING SWORN A THOUSAND TIMES TO EXIST ONLY FOR ONE ANOTHER WE GAVE OURSELVES UP TO THE TASK OF SHEWING EACH OTHER MARKS OF OUR AFFECTION
6221-6879-0022 AN OLD AND DEVOTED SERVANT WAS THE FIRST TO FIND OUT OUR CONNECTION AND THE CONDITION OF MY MISTRESS AND SHE TOLD HER THAT SHE FELT IN DUTY BOUND TO TELL HER FATHER BUT MY SWEETHEART SUCCEEDED IN MAKING HER PROMISE TO BE SILENT
6221-6879-0023 SAYING THAT IN THE COURSE OF THE WEEK SHE HERSELF WOULD TELL HIM THROUGH HER CONFESSOR SHE INFORMED ME OF ALL THIS AND INSTEAD OF GOING TO CONFESSION WE PREPARED FOR FLIGHT SHE HAD LAID HANDS ON A GOOD SUM OF MONEY AND SOME DIAMONDS WHICH HAD BELONGED TO HER MOTHER
6221-6879-0024 BUT TO DAY THE COUNT CALLED ME AFTER DINNER AND GIVING ME A LETTER HE TOLD ME TO START AT ONCE AND TO DELIVER IT WITH MY OWN HAND TO THE PERSON TO WHOM IT WAS ADDRESSED AT VENICE HE SPOKE TO ME SO KINDLY AND QUIETLY THAT I HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF THE FATE IN STORE FOR ME
6221-6879-0025 I WENT TO GET MY CLOAK SAID GOOD BYE TO MY LITTLE WIFE TELLING HER THAT I SHOULD SOON RETURN SEEING DEEPER BELOW THE SURFACE THAN I AND PERCHANCE HAVING A PRESENTIMENT OF MY MISFORTUNE SHE WAS SICK AT HEART I CAME HERE IN HOT HASTE AND TOOK CARE TO DELIVER THE FATAL LETTER
6221-6879-0026 THEY MADE ME WAIT FOR AN ANSWER AND IN THE MEAN TIME I WENT TO AN INN BUT AS I CAME OUT I WAS ARRESTED AND PUT IN THE GUARD ROOM WHERE I WAS KEPT TILL THEY BROUGHT ME HERE I SUPPOSE SIR I MIGHT CONSIDER THE YOUNG COUNTESS AS MY WIFE YOU MAKE A MISTAKE BUT NATURE
6221-6879-0027 NATURE WHEN A MAN LISTENS TO HER AND NOTHING ELSE TAKES HIM FROM ONE FOLLY TO ANOTHER TILL SHE PUTS HIM UNDER THE LEADS I AM UNDER THE LEADS THEN AM I AS I AM
6221-6879-0028 THE POOR YOUNG MAN SHED SOME BITTER TEARS HE WAS A WELL MADE LAD OPEN HONEST AND AMOROUS BEYOND WORDS
6221-6879-0029 IN ALL HIS TEARS AND LAMENTATIONS HE THOUGHT NOT OF HIMSELF BUT ALWAYS OF HIS SWEETHEART
6221-6879-0030 BUT I UNDECEIVED HIM AND OFFERED HIM A SHARE OF WHAT I HAD HIS HEART HOWEVER WAS TOO FULL FOR HIM TO EAT IN THE EVENING I GAVE HIM MY MATTRESS ON WHICH HE PASSED THE NIGHT
6221-6879-0031 DREADING THE RESULTS OF A LOVER'S DREAMS
6221-6879-0032 AS A CLOAK TO THE HONOUR OF HIS DAUGHTER AND HIS HOUSE THE NEXT DAY HE WAS GIVEN A MATTRESS AND A DINNER TO THE VALUE OF FIFTEEN SOUS WHICH THE TRIBUNAL HAD ASSIGNED TO HIM EITHER AS A FAVOUR OR A CHARITY FOR THE WORD JUSTICE WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE IN SPEAKING OF THIS TERRIBLE BODY
6221-6879-0033 HE AGREED WILLINGLY AND HAVING TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS LUCKY TO BE IN MY COMPANY HE SAID THAT WE COULD WALK IN THE GARRET FOR HALF AN HOUR I FOUND THIS WALK AN EXCELLENT THING FOR MY HEALTH AND MY PLAN OF ESCAPE WHICH HOWEVER I COULD NOT CARRY OUT FOR ELEVEN MONTHS AFTERWARDS
6221-6879-0034 AT THE END OF THIS RESORT OF RATS I SAW A NUMBER OF OLD PIECES OF FURNITURE THROWN ON THE GROUND TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF TWO GREAT CHESTS AND IN FRONT OF A LARGE PILE OF PAPERS SEWN UP INTO SEPARATE VOLUMES
6221-6879-0035 AND I FOUND THEM TO BE ACCOUNTS OF TRIALS AND VERY DIVERTING FOR I WAS ALLOWED TO READ THESE PAPERS WHICH HAD ONCE CONTAINED SUCH SECRETS I FOUND SOME CURIOUS REPLIES TO THE JUDGES QUESTIONS RESPECTING THE SEDUCTION OF MAIDENS GALLANTRIES CARRIED A LITTLE TOO FAR BY PERSONS EMPLOYED IN GIRLS SCHOOLS
6221-6879-0036 FACTS RELATING TO CONFESSORS WHO HAD ABUSED THEIR PENITENTS SCHOOLMASTERS CONVICTED OF PEDERASTY WITH THEIR PUPILS AND GUARDIANS WHO HAD SEDUCED THEIR WARDS SOME OF THE PAPERS DATING TWO OR THREE CENTURIES BACK
6221-6879-0037 AMONG THE PIECES OF FURNITURE ON THE FLOOR I SAW A WARMING PAN A KETTLE A FIRE SHOVEL A PAIR OF TONGS SOME OLD CANDLE STICKS SOME EARTHENWARE POTS AND EVEN A SYRINGE
6221-6879-0038 BUT WHAT INTERESTED ME MOST WAS A STRAIGHT IRON BAR AS THICK AS MY THUMB AND ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF LONG HOWEVER I LEFT EVERYTHING AS IT WAS AS MY PLANS HAD NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY RIPENED BY TIME FOR ME TO APPROPRIATE ANY OBJECT IN PARTICULAR
6221-6879-0039 ONE DAY TOWARDS THE END OF THE MONTH MY COMPANION WAS TAKEN AWAY AND LAWRENCE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD BEEN CONDEMNED TO THE PRISONS KNOWN AS THE FOURS WHICH ARE WITHIN THE SAME WALLS AS THE ORDINARY PRISONS BUT BELONG TO THE STATE INQUISITORS
6221-6879-0040 THE PRISONS ARE GLOOMY BUT THERE IS AN OIL LAMP IN THE MIDST WHICH GIVES THE NECESSARY LIGHT AND THERE IS NO FEAR OF FIRE AS EVERYTHING IS MADE OF MARBLE I HEARD A LONG TIME AFTER THAT THE UNFORTUNATE MAGGIORIN WAS THERE FOR FIVE YEARS AND WAS AFTERWARDS SENT TO CERIGO FOR TEN
6221-6879-0041 I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE EVER CAME FROM THERE HE HAD KEPT ME GOOD COMPANY AND THIS I DISCOVERED AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE FOR IN A FEW DAYS I BECAME AS MELANCHOLY AS BEFORE FORTUNATELY I WAS STILL ALLOWED MY WALK IN THE GARRET AND I BEGAN TO EXAMINE ITS CONTENTS WITH MORE MINUTENESS
6221-6879-0042 PIECES OF CARDBOARD UNCUT PENS AND CLEWS OF PACK THREAD THE OTHER WAS FASTENED DOWN A PIECE OF POLISHED BLACK MARBLE AN INCH THICK SIX INCHES LONG AND THREE BROAD ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION AND I POSSESSED MYSELF OF IT WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO WITH IT
6221-6879-0043 AND I SECRETED IT IN MY CELL COVERING IT UP WITH MY SHIRTS A WEEK AFTER MAGGIORIN HAD GONE LAWRENCE TOLD ME THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY I SHOULD SOON GET ANOTHER COMPANION THIS FELLOW LAWRENCE WHO AT BOTTOM WAS A MERE GABBLING FOOL
6221-6879-0044 BEGAN TO GET UNEASY AT MY NEVER ASKING HIM ANY QUESTIONS THIS FONDNESS FOR GOSSIP WAS NOT ALTOGETHER APPROPRIATE TO HIS OFFICE BUT WHERE IS ONE TO FIND BEINGS ABSOLUTELY VILE THERE ARE SUCH PERSONS BUT HAPPILY THEY ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AND ARE NOT TO BE SOUGHT FOR IN THE LOWER ORDERS
6221-6879-0045 AND THOUGHT THAT THE REASON I ASKED NO QUESTIONS MUST BE THAT I THOUGHT HIM INCAPABLE OF ANSWERING THEM AND FEELING HURT AT THIS AND WISHING TO PROVE TO ME THAT I MADE A MISTAKE HE BEGAN TO GOSSIP WITHOUT BEING SOLICITED I BELIEVE YOU WILL OFTEN HAVE VISITORS SAID HE
6221-6879-0046 AS THE OTHER SIX CELLS HAVE EACH TWO PRISONERS WHO ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE SENT TO THE FOURS I MADE HIM NO REPLY BUT HE WENT ON IN A FEW SECONDS THEY SEND TO THE FOURS ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN SENTENCED THOUGH THEY KNOW NOTHING OF THAT
6221-6879-0047 THE PRISONERS WHOM I HAVE CHARGE OF UNDER THE LEADS ARE LIKE YOURSELF PERSONS OF NOTE
6221-6879-0048 HE THEN COMMENCED TO SING HIS OWN PRAISES WHICH CONSISTED OF NEGATIVE CLAUSES I'M NO THIEF NOR TRAITOR NOR GREEDY NOR MALICIOUS NOR BRUTAL AS ALL MY PREDECESSORS WERE AND WHEN I HAVE DRUNK A PINT OVER AND ABOVE I AM ALL THE BETTER FOR
6221-6879-0049 MY WIFE WHO COOKS FOR YOU EVERY DAY AND IS ONLY TWENTY FOUR GOES TO SEE HIM WHEN SHE WILL AND HE WILL HAVE HER COME IN WITHOUT CEREMONY EVEN IF HE BE IN BED AND THAT'S MORE THAN HE'LL DO FOR A SENATOR I PROMISE YOU YOU WILL BE ALWAYS HAVING THE NEW COMERS IN YOUR CELL BUT NEVER FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME
6221-6879-0050 AND IF THEY BE FOREIGNERS THEY ARE SENT ACROSS THE FRONTIER FOR OUR GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HOLD ITSELF MASTER OF THE SUBJECTS OF OTHER PRINCES IF THEY BE NOT IN ITS SERVICE THE CLEMENCY OF THE COURT IS BEYOND COMPARE THERE'S NOT ANOTHER IN THE WORLD THAT TREATS ITS PRISONERS SO WELL
6221-6879-0051 THEY SAY IT'S CRUEL TO DISALLOW WRITING AND VISITORS BUT THAT'S FOOLISH FOR WHAT ARE WRITING AND COMPANY BUT WASTE OF TIME
6221-6879-0052 SUCH WAS ALMOST WORD FOR WORD THE FIRST HARANGUE WITH WHICH THE FELLOW HONOURED ME AND I MUST SAY I FOUND IT AMUSING I SAW THAT IF THE MAN HAD BEEN LESS OF A FOOL HE WOULD MOST CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN MORE OF A SCOUNDREL
6221-6879-0053 THE NEXT DAY BROUGHT ME A NEW MESSMATE WHO WAS TREATED AS MAGGIORIN HAD BEEN AND I THUS FOUND IT NECESSARY TO BUY ANOTHER IVORY SPOON FOR AS THE NEWCOMERS WERE GIVEN NOTHING ON THE FIRST DAY OF THEIR IMPRISONMENT
6221-6879-0054 MY NEW MATE MADE ME A LOW BOW FOR MY BEARD NOW FOUR INCHES LONG WAS STILL MORE IMPOSING THAN MY FIGURE LAWRENCE OFTEN LENT ME SCISSORS TO CUT MY NAILS BUT HE WAS FORBIDDEN UNDER PAIN OF VERY HEAVY PUNISHMENT TO LET ME TOUCH MY BEARD
6221-6879-0055 I KNEW NOT THE REASON OF THIS ORDER BUT I ENDED BY BECOMING USED TO MY BEARD AS ONE GETS USED TO EVERYTHING THE NEW COMER WAS A MAN OF ABOUT FIFTY APPROACHING MY SIZE A LITTLE BENT THIN WITH A LARGE MOUTH AND VERY BAD TEETH
6221-6879-0056 HE HAD SMALL GREY EYES HIDDEN UNDER THICK EYEBROWS OF A RED COLOUR WHICH MADE HIM LOOK LIKE AN OWL AND THIS PICTURE WAS SET OFF BY A SMALL BLACK WIG WHICH EXHALED A DISAGREEABLE ODOUR OF OIL AND BY A DRESS OF COARSE GREY CLOTH
6221-6879-0057 HE ACCEPTED MY OFFER OF DINNER BUT WAS RESERVED AND SAID NOT A WORD THE WHOLE DAY AND I WAS ALSO SILENT THINKING HE WOULD SOON RECOVER THE USE OF HIS TONGUE AS HE DID THE NEXT DAY
6221-6879-0058 WHAT HE WOULD HAVE FOR DINNER AND FOR MONEY TO PAY FOR IT I HAVE NO MONEY WHAT A MONEYED MAN LIKE YOU HAVE NO MONEY I HAVEN'T A SOU VERY GOOD IN THAT CASE I WILL GET YOU SOME ARMY BISCUIT AND WATER ACCORDING TO INSTRUCTIONS
6221-6879-0059 HE WENT OUT AND RETURNED DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS WITH A POUND AND A HALF OF BISCUIT AND A PITCHER WHICH HE SET BEFORE THE PRISONER AND THEN WENT AWAY LEFT ALONE WITH THIS PHANTOM I HEARD A SIGH AND MY PITY MADE ME BREAK THE SILENCE DON'T SIGH SIR YOU SHALL SHARE MY DINNER
6221-6879-0060 BUT I THINK YOU HAVE MADE A GREAT MISTAKE IN COMING HERE WITHOUT MONEY I HAVE SOME BUT IT DOES NOT DO TO LET THOSE HARPIES KNOW OF IT AND SO YOU CONDEMN YOURSELF TO BREAD AND WATER TRULY A WISE PROCEEDING DO YOU KNOW THE REASON OF YOUR IMPRISONMENT
6221-6879-0061 MY NAME IS SQUALDO NOBILI MY FATHER WAS A COUNTRYMAN WHO HAD ME TAUGHT READING AND WRITING AND AT HIS DEATH LEFT ME HIS COTTAGE AND THE SMALL PATCH OF GROUND BELONGING TO IT I LIVED IN FRIULI ABOUT A DAY'S JOURNEY FROM THE MARSHES OF UDINE
6221-6879-0062 AS A TORRENT CALLED CORNO OFTEN DAMAGED MY LITTLE PROPERTY I DETERMINED TO SELL IT AND TO SET UP IN VENICE WHICH I DID TEN YEARS AGO
6221-6879-0063 ALL MEN ENJOYED THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY I BELIEVED THAT BY UTILIZING MY CAPITAL I MIGHT MAKE A LITTLE INCOME AND I BEGAN TO LEND MONEY ON SECURITY RELYING ON MY THRIFT MY JUDGMENT AND MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD I CHOSE THIS BUSINESS IN PREFERENCE TO ALL OTHERS
6221-6879-0064 THOUGH I HAD EXPENDED TWO THOUSAND ON HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES AS I WISHED TO LIVE IN COMFORT IN THIS FASHION I SAW MYSELF IN A FAIR WAY OF MAKING A RESPECTABLE FORTUNE IN TIME BUT ONE DAY HAVING LENT A JEW TWO SEQUINS UPON SOME BOOKS
6221-6879-0065 IT WAS THEN I FOUND OUT HOW GOOD A THING IT IS TO BE ABLE TO READ FOR THIS BOOK WHICH YOU SIR MAY NOT HAVE READ CONTAINS ALL THAT A MAN NEED KNOW PURGING HIM OF ALL THE PREJUDICES OF HIS CHILDHOOD
6221-6879-0066 ONE'S EYES ARE OPENED ONE KNOWS THE WAY TO BLISS ONE BECOMES WISE INDEED
6221-6879-0067 THIS CURIOUS DISCOURSE MADE ME KNOW MY MAN
6221-6879-0068 THE AUTHOR WHO WAS A GREAT ADMIRER OF MONTAIGNE THOUGHT TO SURPASS HIS MODEL BUT TOILED IN VAIN HE IS NOT MUCH READ DESPITE THE PROHIBITION TO READ HIS WORKS WHICH SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM SOME POPULARITY HE HAD THE IMPUDENCE TO GIVE HIS BOOK THE TITLE OF ONE OF SOLOMON'S TREATISES
6221-6879-0069 A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH DOES NOT SAY MUCH FOR HIS MODESTY MY COMPANION WENT ON AS FOLLOWS
6221-6879-0070 I PUSHED MY BUSINESS IN SUCH SORT THAT AT THE END OF SIX YEARS I COULD LAY MY HAND ON TEN THOUSAND SEQUINS
6221-6879-0071 AND IN CONTINUAL NEED OF MONEY SO DO THE WISE GATHER WHAT THE FOOL DROPS THREE YEARS AGO A CERTAIN COUNT SERIMAN CAME AND ASKED ME TO TAKE FROM HIM FIVE HUNDRED SEQUINS TO PUT THEM IN MY BUSINESS AND TO GIVE HIM HALF PROFITS
6221-6879-0072 AT THE END OF A YEAR I SENT HIM SEVENTY FIVE SEQUINS WHICH MADE FIFTEEN PER CENT ON HIS MONEY HE GAVE ME A RECEIPT FOR IT BUT WAS ILL PLEASED HE WAS WRONG FOR I WAS IN NO NEED OF MONEY AND HAD NOT USED HIS FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES
6221-6879-0073 AT THE END OF THE SECOND YEAR OUT OF PURE GENEROSITY I SENT HIM THE SAME AMOUNT
6221-6879-0074 CERTAINLY I SAID BUT I MUST DEDUCT THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YOU HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED ENRAGED AT THIS HE SERVED ME WITH A WRIT FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE WHOLE SUM A CLEVER LAWYER UNDERTOOK MY DEFENCE AND WAS ABLE TO GAIN ME TWO YEARS THREE MONTHS AGO I WAS SPOKEN TO AS TO AN AGREEMENT
6221-6879-0075 THE SPANISH AMBASSADOR'S SECRETARY AND FOR A SMALL SUM HE LET ME A HOUSE IN THE PRECINCTS OF THE EMBASSY
6221-6879-0076 BUT I CLAIMED A REDUCTION OF A HUNDRED SEQUINS ON ACCOUNT OF THE COSTS OF THE LAWSUIT A WEEK AGO THE LAWYERS ON BOTH SIDES CAME TO ME I SHEWED THEM A PURSE OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEQUINS AND TOLD THEM THEY MIGHT TAKE IT BUT NOT A PENNY MORE THEY WENT AWAY WITHOUT SAYING A WORD
6221-6879-0077 TO SEND THEIR MEN AT ONCE TO MY HOUSE TO MAKE SEARCH THEREIN I THOUGHT THE THING IMPOSSIBLE UNDER THE SHELTER OF A FOREIGN AMBASSADOR AND INSTEAD OF TAKING THE USUAL PRECAUTIONS I WAITED THE APPROACH OF THE MEN AT ARMS ONLY PUTTING MY MONEY IN A PLACE OF SAFETY
6221-6879-0078 AND ON MY TELLING HIM THAT I HADN'T A FARTHING HE SEIZED ME AND HERE I AM I SHUDDERED LESS AT HAVING SUCH AN INFAMOUS COMPANION THAN AT HIS EVIDENTLY CONSIDERING ME AS HIS EQUAL FOR IF HE HAD THOUGHT OF ME IN ANY OTHER LIGHT HE WOULD CERTAINLY NOT HAVE TOLD ME THIS LONG TALE
6221-6879-0079 DOUBTLESS IN THE BELIEF THAT I SHOULD TAKE HIS PART IN ALL THE FOLLY ABOUT CHARRON WITH WHICH HE TORMENTED ME IN THE THREE DAYS WE WERE TOGETHER I FOUND BY BITTER EXPERIENCE THE TRUTH OF THE ITALIAN PROVERB GUARDATI DA COLUI
6221-6879-0080 BY READING THE WORK OF THE MISGUIDED PRIEST HE HAD BECOME AN ATHEIST AND OF THIS HE MADE HIS BOAST ALL THE DAY LONG
6221-6879-0081 AND TOOK OUT OF HIS SHOES TWO PURSES CONTAINING THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEQUINS
6221-6879-0082 HE WENT TO TAKE THEM TO THE SECRETARY A FEW MOMENTS AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED AND TAKING HIS CLOAK WENT AWAY LAWRENCE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD BEEN SET AT LIBERTY I THOUGHT AND WITH GOOD REASON THAT TO MAKE HIM ACKNOWLEDGE HIS DEBT AND PAY IT THE SECRETARY HAD THREATENED HIM WITH THE TORTURE
6221-6879-0083 WHO DETEST THE PRINCIPLE OF TORTURE
6221-6879-0084 ON NEW YEAR'S DAY SEVENTEEN THIRTY THREE I RECEIVED MY PRESENTS LAWRENCE BROUGHT ME A DRESSING GOWN LINED WITH FOXSKIN A COVERLET OF WADDED SILK AND A BEAR SKIN BAG FOR ME TO PUT MY LEGS IN WHICH I WELCOMED GLADLY
6221-6879-0085 FOR THE COLDNESS WAS UNBEARABLE AS THE HEAT IN AUGUST LAWRENCE TOLD ME THAT I MIGHT SPEND TO THE AMOUNT OF SIX SEQUINS A MONTH THAT I MIGHT HAVE WHAT BOOKS I LIKED AND TAKE IN THE NEWSPAPER
6221-6879-0086 THE MAN WHO WOULD KNOW WHAT WERE MY FEELINGS AT ALL THIS MUST HAVE BEEN IN A SIMILAR SITUATION TO MY OWN IN THE FIRST GUSH OF FEELING I FORGAVE MY OPPRESSORS AND WAS ON THE POINT OF GIVING UP THE IDEA OF ESCAPE SO EASILY SHALL YOU MOVE A MAN THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT LOW AND OVERWHELMED WITH MISFORTUNE
6221-6879-0087 AND THAT ON HIS KNEES AND WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES HE HAD ENTREATED THEM TO LET HIM GIVE ME THIS MARK OF HIS AFFECTION IF I WERE STILL IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING THE INQUISITORS WERE MOVED AND WERE NOT ABLE TO REFUSE HIS REQUEST
6221-6879-0088 I WROTE DOWN WITHOUT DELAY THE NAMES OF THE BOOKS I WANTED ONE FINE MORNING AS I WAS WALKING IN THE GARRET MY EYES FELL ON THE IRON BAR I HAVE MENTIONED AND I SAW THAT IT MIGHT VERY EASILY BE MADE INTO A DEFENSIVE OR OFFENSIVE WEAPON
6221-6879-0089 I TOOK POSSESSION OF IT AND HAVING HIDDEN IT UNDER MY DRESSING GOWN I CONVEYED IT INTO MY CELL AS SOON AS I WAS ALONE I TOOK THE PIECE OF BLACK MARBLE AND I FOUND THAT I HAD TO MY HAND AN EXCELLENT WHETSTONE FOR BY RUBBING THE BAR WITH THE STONE I OBTAINED A VERY GOOD EDGE
6221-6879-0090 MY INTEREST ROUSED IN THIS WORK IN WHICH I WAS BUT AN APPRENTICE AND IN THE FASHION IN WHICH I SEEMED LIKELY TO BECOME POSSESSED OF AN INSTRUMENT TOTALLY PROHIBITED UNDER THE LEADS IMPELLED PERHAPS
6221-6879-0091 ALSO BY MY VANITY TO MAKE A WEAPON WITHOUT ANY OF THE NECESSARY TOOLS AND INCITED BY MY VERY DIFFICULTIES
6221-6879-0092 AND WITHOUT A DROP OF OIL TO SOFTEN THE IRON I MADE UP MY MIND TO PERSEVERE IN MY DIFFICULT TASK MY SALIVA SERVED ME IN THE STEAD OF OIL AND I TOILED EIGHT DAYS TO PRODUCE EIGHT EDGES TERMINATING IN A SHARP POINT THE EDGES BEING AN INCH AND A HALF IN LENGTH
6221-6879-0093 MY BAR THUS SHARPENED FORMED AN EIGHT SIDED DAGGER AND WOULD HAVE DONE JUSTICE TO A FIRST RATE CUTLER NO ONE CAN IMAGINE THE TOIL AND TROUBLE I HAD TO BEAR NOR THE PATIENCE REQUIRED TO FINISH THIS DIFFICULT TASK WITHOUT ANY OTHER TOOLS THAN A LOOSE PIECE OF STONE
6221-6879-0094 I PUT MYSELF IN FACT TO A KIND OF TORTURE UNKNOWN TO THE TYRANTS OF ALL AGES MY RIGHT ARM HAD BECOME SO STIFF THAT I COULD HARDLY MOVE IT THE PALM OF MY HAND WAS COVERED WITH A LARGE SCAR THE RESULT OF THE NUMEROUS BLISTERS CAUSED BY THE HARDNESS AND THE LENGTH OF THE WORK
6221-6879-0095 NO ONE WOULD GUESS THE SUFFERINGS I UNDERWENT TO BRING MY WORK TO COMPLETION PROUD OF WHAT I HAD DONE WITHOUT THINKING WHAT USE I COULD MAKE OF MY WEAPON MY FIRST CARE WAS TO HIDE IT IN SUCH A MANNER AS WOULD DEFY A MINUTE SEARCH
6221-6879-0096 I CAST MY EYES ON MY ARM CHAIR AND THERE I CONTRIVED TO HIDE IT SO AS TO BE SECURE FROM ALL SUSPICION THUS DID PROVIDENCE AID ME TO CONTRIVE A WONDERFUL AND ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE PLAN OF ESCAPE I CONFESS TO A FEELING OF VANITY NOT BECAUSE I EVENTUALLY SUCCEEDED
6221-6879-0097 FOR I OWED SOMETHING TO GOOD LUCK BUT BECAUSE I WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO UNDERTAKE SUCH A SCHEME IN SPITE OF THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH MIGHT HAVE RUINED MY PLANS AND PREVENTED MY EVER ATTAINING LIBERTY AFTER THINKING FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS AS TO WHAT I SHOULD DO WITH THE BAR I HAD MADE INTO AN EDGED TOOL
6221-6879-0098 AS THICK AS A WALKING STICK AND TWENTY INCHES LONG I DETERMINED THAT THE BEST PLAN WOULD BE TO MAKE A HOLE IN THE FLOOR UNDER MY BED
6221-6879-0099 I KNEW THAT THIS ROOM WAS OPENED EVERY MORNING AND I FELT PERSUADED THAT AFTER I HAD MADE MY HOLE I COULD EASILY LET MYSELF DOWN WITH MY SHEETS WHICH I WOULD MAKE INTO A ROPE AND FASTEN TO MY BED ONCE THERE I WOULD HIDE UNDER THE TABLE OF THE COURT AND IN THE MORNING WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPENED
6221-6879-0100 I COULD ESCAPE AND GET TO A PLACE OF SAFETY BEFORE ANYONE COULD FOLLOW ME I THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE THAT A SENTRY MIGHT BE PLACED IN THE HALL BUT MY SHORT PIKE OUGHT TO SOON RID ME OF HIM THE FLOOR MIGHT BE OF DOUBLE OR EVEN OF TRIPLE THICKNESS AND THIS THOUGHT PUZZLED ME
6221-6879-0101 FOR IN THAT CASE HOW WAS I TO PREVENT THE GUARD SWEEPING OUT THE ROOM THROUGHOUT THE TWO MONTHS MY WORK MIGHT LAST IF I FORBADE THEM TO DO SO I MIGHT ROUSE SUSPICION ALL THE MORE AS TO FREE MYSELF OF THE FLEAS I HAD REQUESTED THEM TO SWEEP OUT THE CELL EVERY DAY
6221-6879-0102 I MUST FIND SOME WAY OUT OF THIS DIFFICULTY I BEGAN BY FORBIDDING THEM TO SWEEP WITHOUT GIVING ANY REASON A WEEK AFTER LAWRENCE ASKED ME WHY I DID SO I TOLD HIM BECAUSE OF THE DUST WHICH MIGHT MAKE ME COUGH VIOLENTLY AND GIVE ME SOME FATAL INJURY
6221-6879-0103 I WILL MAKE THEM WATER THE FLOOR SAID HE THAT WOULD BE WORSE LAWRENCE FOR THE DAMP MIGHT CAUSE A PLETHORA IN THIS MANNER I OBTAINED A WEEK'S RESPITE BUT AT THE END OF THAT TIME THE LOUT GAVE ORDERS THAT MY CELL SHOULD BE SWEPT
6221-6879-0104 HE HAD THE BED CARRIED OUT INTO THE GARRET AND ON PRETENCE OF HAVING THE SWEEPING DONE WITH GREATER CARE HE LIGHTED A CANDLE THIS LET ME KNOW THAT THE RASCAL WAS SUSPICIOUS OF SOMETHING BUT I WAS CRAFTY ENOUGH TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF HIM AND SO FAR FROM GIVING UP MY PLEA I ONLY THOUGHT HOW I COULD PUT IT ON GOOD TRAIN
6221-6879-0105 NEXT MORNING I PRICKED MY FINGER AND COVERED MY HANDKERCHIEF WITH THE BLOOD AND THEN AWAITED LAWRENCE IN BED
6221-6879-0106 WHICH HAD MADE ME BRING UP ALL THE BLOOD HE SAW GET ME A DOCTOR THE DOCTOR CAME ORDERED ME TO BE BLED AND WROTE ME A PRESCRIPTION
6221-6879-0107 THE DOCTOR BLAMED HIM FOR DOING SO AND JUST AS IF I HAD ASKED HIM HE TOLD US OF A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD DIED FROM THE SAME CAUSE AND SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE DANGEROUS THAN BREATHING IN DUST LAWRENCE CALLED ALL THE GODS TO WITNESS THAT HE HAD ONLY HAD THE ROOM SWEPT FOR MY SAKE
6221-6879-0108 WHEN THE DOCTOR WAS GONE LAWRENCE BEGGED MY PARDON AND ASSURED ME THAT ALL THE OTHER PRISONERS WERE IN GOOD HEALTH ALTHOUGH THEIR CELLS WERE SWEPT OUT REGULARLY BUT WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS IS WORTH CONSIDERING SAID HE AND I SHALL TELL THEM ALL ABOUT IT FOR I LOOK UPON THEM AS MY CHILDREN
6221-6879-0109 THE BLOOD LETTING DID ME GOOD AS IT MADE ME SLEEP AND RELIEVED ME OF THE SPASMS WITH WHICH I WAS SOMETIMES TROUBLED
6221-6879-0110 BUT THE TIME TO SET ABOUT MY WORK WAS NOT YET COME IT WAS STILL TOO COLD AND I COULD NOT HOLD THE BAR FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME WITHOUT MY HAND BECOMING STIFF MY SCHEME REQUIRED MUCH THOUGHT
6221-6879-0111 I HAD TO EXERCISE BOLDNESS AND FORESIGHT TO RID MYSELF OF TROUBLES WHICH CHANCE MIGHT BRING TO PASS OR WHICH I COULD FORESEE THE SITUATION OF A MAN WHO HAD TO ACT AS I HAD IS AN UNHAPPY ONE BUT IN RISKING ALL FOR ALL HALF ITS BITTERNESS VANISHES
6221-6879-0112 THE LONG NIGHTS OF WINTER DISTRESSED ME FOR I HAD TO PASS NINETEEN MORTAL HOURS IN DARKNESS AND ON THE CLOUDY DAYS WHICH ARE COMMON ENOUGH AT VENICE THE LIGHT I HAD WAS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO READ WITHOUT ANY DISTRACTIONS I FELL BACK ON THE IDEA OF MY ESCAPE
6221-6879-0113 AND A MAN WHO ALWAYS THINKS ON ONE SUBJECT IS IN DANGER OF BECOMING A MONOMANIAC A WRETCHED KITCHEN LAMP WOULD HAVE MADE ME HAPPY BUT HOW AM I TO GET SUCH A THING O BLESSED PREROGATIVE OF THOUGHT HOW HAPPY WAS I WHEN I THOUGHT I HAD FOUND A WAY TO POSSESS MYSELF OF SUCH A TREASURE
6221-6879-0114 TO MAKE SUCH A LAMP I REQUIRED A VASE WICKS OIL A FLINT AND STEEL TINDER AND MATCHES A PORRINGER WOULD DO FOR THE VASE AND I HAD ONE WHICH WAS USED FOR COOKING EGGS IN BUTTER
6221-6879-0115 PRETENDING THAT THE COMMON OIL DID NOT AGREE WITH ME I GOT THEM TO BUY ME LUCCA OIL FOR MY SALAD AND MY COTTON COUNTERPANE WOULD FURNISH ME WITH WICKS I THEN SAID I HAD THE TOOTHACHE AND ASKED LAWRENCE TO GET ME A PUMICE STONE
