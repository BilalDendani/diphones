6924-291609-0000 FOR NOW SHE CAN ESTABLISH A SYSTEM OF RESPONSES ON THE PART OF THE CHILD THAT WILL SHOW HER WHEN HE PERCEIVES THE SOUNDS SHE USES IN HER TESTS IN ORDER TO BE CERTAIN THAT THE LITTLE ONE KNOWS WHAT SHE WISHES OF HIM SHE MUST BEGIN WITH SOME SENSATION THAT SHE IS SURE HE FEELS
6924-291609-0001 AT LEAST DOES NOT KNOW THE NAMES OF THE NUMBERS LET THE MOTHER PAT HIM ONCE ON THE SHOULDER AND THEN CAUSE HIM TO HOLD UP ONE OF HIS LITTLE FINGERS THEN PAT HIM TWICE AND MAKE HIM HOLD UP TWO FINGERS THEN THREE TIMES AND HAVE HIM PUT UP THREE FINGERS
6924-291609-0002 NOW RETURN TO ONE PAT AND ONE FINGER REPEAT TWO PATS AND THE HOLDING UP OF TWO OF HIS FINGERS AND THREE PATS AND THREE FINGERS GO OVER AND OVER THIS LITTLE GAME UNTIL HE HAS GRASPED THE IDEA AND WILL HOLD UP AS MANY FINGERS AS HE FEELS PATS
6924-291609-0003 SIMPLE AS THE IDEA SEEMS IT WILL OFTEN TAKE A BRIGHT CHILD SOME TIME TO REALIZE WHAT YOU WANT HIM TO DO BUT YOU ARE SURE THAT HE FEELS THE PATS WHEREAS IF YOU BEGAN AT ONCE WITH SOUNDS
6924-291609-0004 HE WILL WEARY OF THE EXERCISE SOON AND THEN MOTHER MAY AS WELL TURN TO SOMETHING ELSE TILL HE HAS RESTED HAVING ESTABLISHED THIS SYSTEM OF RESPONSE ON HIS PART TO SENSATIONS PERCEIVED
6924-291609-0005 IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO SHIFT FROM THE NUMBER OF PATS TO THE NUMBER OF TIMES HE HEARS A NOISE THIS ONCE ACCOMPLISHED TESTS CAN BE MADE WITH SOUNDS OF DIFFERENT KINDS DIFFERENT PITCH AND DIFFERENT VOLUME VARYING THE DISTANCE THE INSTRUMENTS AND THE VOWEL
6924-291609-0006 WHEN THE ARTICULATE SOUNDS ARE REACHED HE CAN BE SHOWN A WHISTLE THEN WHEN IT IS BLOWN BEHIND HIS BACK HE WILL HOLD UP AS MANY FINGERS AS THE TIMES IT WAS BLOWN IF HE PERCEIVES THE SOUND HE CAN BE ASKED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A WHISTLE A LITTLE BELL AND THE CLAPPING OF THE HANDS
6924-291609-0007 THE VOWEL SOUNDS MAY BE UTTERED NOT FAR FROM HIS EAR BUT BEHIND HIM
6924-291609-0008 WITH UNFAILING ACCURACY OR AT LEAST
6924-291609-0009 A SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE ESTIMATE CAN BE FORMED OF THE DEGREE OF HIS HEARING POWER SO FAR AS HIS PRESENT NEEDS ARE CONCERNED
6924-291609-0010 IF ANY ABILITY TO PERCEIVE SOUNDS IS FOUND EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO LEAD THE CHILD TO USE IT AND AS THE MOST ESSENTIAL USE OF HEARING IS IN THE COMPREHENSION OF SPOKEN LANGUAGE THE PRINCIPAL EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE ALONG THAT LINE
6924-291609-0011 TAKE THREE OBJECTS THE NAMES OF WHICH ARE SHORT WITH THE PRINCIPAL VOWELS QUITE EASILY DISTINGUISHED A LITTLE TOY STREET CAR A CAP AND A TOY SHEEP WOULD DO NICELY TO BEGIN WITH AS THE THREE WORDS CAR CAP
6924-291609-0012 AND SHEEP ARE NOT EASILY CONFUSED PLACE TWO OF THE OBJECTS BEFORE HIM THE CAR AND THE SHEEP AND SPEAK THE NAME OF ONE OF THEM CAR WE WILL SAY LOUDLY AND DISTINCTLY CLOSE TO HIS EAR
6924-291609-0013 BUT IN SUCH A WAY THAT HE CANNOT SEE YOUR MOUTH THEN SHOW HIM THE CAR REPEAT IT WITH SHEEP AND SHOW HIM THE SHEEP REPEAT CAR AND TAKE HIS LITTLE HAND PUT IT ON THE CAR THEN SHEEP
6924-291609-0014 AND MAKE HIM PUT HIS HAND ON THE SHEEP CONTINUE THIS PROCESS UNTIL HE WILL INDICATE TO YOU THE OBJECT YOU NAME WHEN HE MAKES ONLY OCCASIONAL MISTAKES WITH TWO OBJECTS ADD THE CAP WHEN HE CAN GET THE RIGHT ONE ABOUT NINETY PER CENT OF THE TIME
6924-291609-0015 THEN TAKE THREE NEW WORDS RETURNING OCCASIONALLY TO THE FIRST THREE VERY SOON HIS OWN NAME AND THOSE OF OTHERS WITH PHOTOGRAPHS TO ENABLE HIM TO INDICATE WHICH WILL PROVE OF INTEREST TO HIM WHEN HE HAS SUCCESSFULLY LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH A FEW SINGLE WORDS
6924-291609-0016 A BEGINNING CAN BE MADE ON SHORT SENTENCES COMMANDS THAT HE CAN EXECUTE ARE CONVENIENT SHUT YOUR EYES OPEN YOUR MOUTH CLAP YOUR HANDS CAN FOLLOW DRILL ON THE THREE WORDS EYES MOUTH HANDS
6924-291609-0017 OPEN THE WINDOW SHUT THE WINDOW OPEN THE BOOK SHUT THE BOOK
6924-291609-0018 SIT DOWN WHEN THIS BEGINNING HAS BEEN MADE THE ROAD IS OPEN TO THE GRADUAL INCREASE IN A HEARING VOCABULARY
6924-291609-0019 SO MUCH AT ONCE AS TO CONFUSE AND DISCOURAGE THE CHILD THE SUGGESTIONS ALREADY MADE SHOULD BE STUDIOUSLY FOLLOWED THROUGHOUT HIS WHOLE CHILDHOOD IF HIS HEARING IS NOT TOO SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED
6924-291609-0020 HE WILL BEGIN TO ATTEMPT TO IMITATE SPOKEN SOUNDS BY THE TIME HE IS TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY MONTHS OLD BUT HIS ABILITY TO IMITATE SOUNDS IS NOT AN ACCURATE MEASURE OF HIS ABILITY TO HEAR HE MAY PERCEIVE THE SOUNDS MUCH BETTER THAN HE IS ABLE TO REPRODUCE THEM
6924-291609-0021 DISTINCT UTTERANCE COMES SLOWLY TO THE CHILD WITH NORMAL HEARING AND STILL MORE SLOWLY AND IMPERFECTLY TO THE CHILD WHOSE HEARING IS NOT GOOD BUT THE CONTINUED EFFORT TO MAKE HIM HEAR WORDS AND SENTENCES IS A VERY VALUABLE EXERCISE FOR HIM
6924-291609-0022 AND SHOULD BE FAITHFULLY CONTINUED TILL HE IS OLD ENOUGH TO RESPOND TO THE TESTS OF HEARING AS OUTLINED AND IT HAS BEEN DEFINITELY PROVED THAT HE CANNOT POSSIBLY TELL
6924-291609-0023 THE QUESTION WILL NATURALLY ARISE AS TO WHETHER THE CHILD'S HEARING OF SPEECH CAN BE AIDED BY AN ELECTRIC OR MECHANICAL DEVICE WHEN IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THE CHILD PERCEIVE THE SOUND OF THE VOWELS WITH THE UNAIDED VOICE UTTERED VERY NEAR THE EAR
6924-291609-0024 I BELIEVE IT TO BE BETTER AT FIRST NOT TO INTERPOSE ANY ARTIFICIAL DEVICE
6924-291609-0025 ALTHOUGH UTTERED LOUDLY CLOSE TO THE EAR I COULD AWAKEN THE ATTENTION OF THE CHILD TO SOUND AND STIMULATE THE DORMANT POWER BY THE USE OF AN ACOUSTICON AFTER A FEW MONTHS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH THE INSTRUMENT AND USE ONLY THE UNAIDED VOICE
6924-291609-0026 AT CLOSE RANGE LATER WHEN SOME VOCABULARY HAS BEEN ACQUIRED THROUGH THESE AURICULAR EXERCISES IT IS OFTEN DESIRABLE TO RETURN TO THE ACOUSTICON AND TEACH THE CHILD TO USE IT IN ORDER TO EXTEND THE DISTANCE AT WHICH SOUNDS CAN BE HEARD
6924-291609-0027 BY THE USE OF THE ACOUSTICON IT THEN BECOMES POSSIBLE TO COMMUNICATE BY MEANS OF THE EAR WITHOUT SPEAKING AT SUCH SHORT RANGE IT IS NOT EASY HOWEVER TO INDUCE A CHILD TO USE AN ACOUSTICON AT ALL TIMES
6924-291609-0028 IN THE CASE OF THE VERY SLIGHTLY DEAF CHILD THIS VISUAL TRAINING IS NOT QUITE SO IMPORTANT AS THE AURICULAR TRAINING BUT WHEN THERE IS MUCH DEAFNESS IT IS THE MORE IMPORTANT OF THE TWO
6924-291609-0029 THE COMPREHENSION OF MUCH LANGUAGE CAN BE GIVEN TO THE LITTLE DEAF CHILD BY CONSTANTLY TALKING JUST AS ANY MOTHER DOES TO HER HEARING BABY ONLY BEING ALWAYS CAREFUL TO TAKE A POSITION FACING THE MAIN SOURCE OF LIGHT WHICH SHOULD COME FROM BEHIND THE CHILD
6924-291609-0030 MAMMA IS COMING MAMMA IS HERE WHERE IS MAMMA DO YOU LOVE MAMMA
6924-291609-0031 DAY AFTER DAY WEEK AFTER WEEK THE MOTHER DOES IT FOR PLEASURE TO PLAY WITH AND PET THE DEAR BABY SHE DOES NOT THINK OF IT AS A TEACHING EXERCISE BUT IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE
6924-291609-0032 THE DEAF BABY WILL LEARN GRADUALLY TO ASSOCIATE A MEANING WITH THE VARIOUS SEQUENCES OF MOVEMENT OF THE LIPS IF A LITTLE CARE IS TAKEN TO WATCH HIS EYES AND TO SPEAK WHEN THEY ARE DIRECTED TOWARD THE SPEAKER AND TO STAND IN SUCH RELATION TO THE LIGHT THAT IT FALLS UPON THE SPEAKER'S FACE
6924-291609-0033 THE SPEECH SHOULD BE THE SAME AS TO THE HEARING CHILD BUT IT TAKES A LITTLE MORE CARE AND WATCHFULNESS TO HAVE THE DEAF CHILD SEE THE SAME WORD OR PHRASE AS MANY TIMES AS THE HEARING CHILD HEARS IT IF IT IS SPOKEN WHEN THE BABY IS NOT LOOKING IT DOES NOT HELP
6924-291609-0034 WHEN THE LITTLE ONE IS LEARNING TO WALK THE MOTHER SAYS COME TO MAMMA GO TO DADDY AND GRADUALLY HE LEARNS COME AND GO SHE HAS HIM PLAY HIDE AND SEEK WITH ANOTHER CHILD AND SHE SAYS WHERE IS TOM WHERE IS THE BABY'S MOUTH
6924-291609-0035 AND MOUTH AND NOSE AND THE NAMES OF HIS PLAYMATES OR BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHEN HE IS SITTING ON THE FLOOR SHE PICKS HIM UP SAYING UP WHEN SHE PUTS HIM FROM HER LAP TO THE FLOOR SHE SAYS DOWN IF HE IS NAUGHTY
6924-291609-0036 SHE SAYS NAUGHTY AND PERHAPS SPATS HIS LITTLE HANDS AND SO ON THROUGH THE DAY A LITTLE CARE ON HER PART A LITTLE ADDED THOUGHT AND WATCHFULNESS
6924-291609-0037 PERHAPS A FEW MORE REPETITIONS AND LITTLE BY LITTLE SHE WILL FIND HER DEAF BABY LEARNING TO LOOK AT HER ALWAYS AND TO UNDERSTAND MUCH THAT IS SAID TO HIM SHE MUST ALL THIS TIME REMEMBER ALSO THAT THE SHADES OF FEELING PLEASURE DISAPPOINTMENT APPROVAL DISAPPROVAL
6924-291609-0038 DOUBT CERTAINTY LOVE ANGER JOY WHICH ARE LARGELY CONVEYED TO THE HEARING CHILD BY INTONATION OF VOICE MUST BE CONVEYED TO THE DEAF BABY BY FACIAL EXPRESSION AND MANNER
6924-291609-0039 THEY BECOME VERY KEEN AT INTERPRETING MOODS BY THE LOOK LET THE FACE BE SUNNY AND KIND AND INTERESTED IF POSSIBLE THE FIRST INDICATION OF IMPATIENCE OF BEING BORED AND WEARY WILL DESTROY MUCH OF ONE'S INFLUENCE WITH THE DEAF CHILD
6924-291609-0040 SOMETIMES IT IS HARDER TO DISGUISE ONE'S FEELINGS IN THE FACE THAN IN THE VOICE DO NOT BE CAUGHT UNAWARES INTEREST CHEERFULNESS AND PATIENCE ARE TREMENDOUS FORCES TO HELP THE LITTLE DEAF CHILD SOME ONE HAS SAID
6924-291609-0041 WHEN YOU CONSENT CONSENT CORDIALLY WHEN YOU REFUSE REFUSE FINALLY WHEN YOU PUNISH
