7704-106965-0000 WITH A DEEP FAR AWAY LOOK IN THEM THEY WERE DANCING AND FLASHING WITH EXCITEMENT NOW AND HIS WHOLE FRAME WAS QUIVERING WITH ENTHUSIASM WITH HEAD THROWN BACK AND TONGUE HAND AND FOOT ALL IN MOTION
7704-106965-0001 WITH ONE HAND HE WAS FINGERING A LARGE BRASS BUTTON WHICH FIGURED CONSPICUOUSLY IN THE CENTRE OF HIS SMALL WAISTCOAT AND THIS BUTTON WAS THE SUBJECT OF HIS THEME
7704-106965-0002 AND THEY SHOUTED HURRAH AS THEY MADE AFTER HIM THERE WERE GUNS GOING AND SHELLS FLYING AND SWORDS FLASHING AND HACKING AWAY
7704-106965-0003 AND NO ONE COULD STAND AGAINST HIM NO ONE HE CUT AND HE SLASHED AND HEADS AND ARMS AND LEGS ROLLED OFF AS QUICK AS LIGHTNING ONE AFTER THE OTHER HE GOT UP TO THE COLOURS AND WITH A SHOUT HE PLUNGED HIS SWORD RIGHT THROUGH THE ENEMY'S BODY THAT HAD STOLEN THEM THE ENEMY FELL STONE DEAD
7704-106965-0004 MY FATHER SEIZED THE COLOURS AND LOOKED ROUND HE WAS ALONE THE OTHER SOLDIERS HAD BEEN BEATEN BACK BUT WAS HE IN A FUNK NO HE GAVE A LOUD HURRAH PICKED UP HIS SWORD AND FOUGHT HIS WAY BACK THE ENEMY HARD AFTER HIM IT WAS A RACE FOR LIFE AND HE RAN BACKWARDS THE WHOLE WAY
7704-106965-0005 HE WASN'T GOING TO TURN HIS BACK TO THE ENEMY HE PRESSED ON SHOUTING HURRAH TILL HE GOT TO HIS OWN SIDE AGAIN AND THEN HE REACHED HIS COLONEL CAPTAIN DEAD SIR I'VE GOT THE COLOURS HE SALUTED AS HE SAID IT
7704-106965-0006 AND THAT'S THE STORY OF MY BUTTON PURSUED THE BOY IGNORING WITH SCORN THIS LAST REMARK AND DID YOUR FATHER HAVE ONLY ONE BUTTON TO HIS COAT THE VOICE WAS A STRANGE ONE AND THE BOYS TURNED ROUND TO MEET THE CURIOUS GAZE
