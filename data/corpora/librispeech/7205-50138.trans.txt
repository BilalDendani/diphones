7205-50138-0000 AND HE SOMETIMES FELT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE IF HE HAD BEEN IN A DULL UNIFORM COUNTRY INSTEAD OF AMONG MOUNTAIN PEAKS AND BROAD WOODED VALLEYS WORKING HARD TOO HELPED HIM NOT A LITTLE AND CONIC SECTIONS SERVED HIM ALMOST AS WELL AS THEY SERVED LAURA
7205-50138-0001 A MORE REAL HELP WAS THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF STYLEHURST ON THE FIRST SUNDAY AFTER RECEIVING MISTER EDMONSTONE'S LETTER
7205-50138-0002 AND HE KNEW HE NEEDED ALL THAT COULD STRENGTHEN SUCH A DISPOSITION MANY A QUESTION DID HE ASK HIMSELF TO CERTIFY WHETHER HE WILFULLY ENTERTAINED MALICE OR HATRED OR ANY UNCHARITABLENESS IT WAS A LONG DIFFICULT EXAMINATION
7205-50138-0003 BUT AT ITS CLOSE HE FELT CONVINCED THAT IF SUCH PASSIONS KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF HIS HEART IT WAS NOT AT HIS OWN SUMMONS AND THAT HE DROVE THEM AWAY WITHOUT LISTENING TO THEM AND SURELY HE MIGHT APPROACH TO GAIN THE BEST AID IN THAT BATTLE
7205-50138-0004 ESPECIALLY AS HE WAS CERTAIN OF HIS STRONG AND DEEP REPENTANCE FOR HIS FIT OF PASSION AND LONGING EARNESTLY FOR THE PLEDGE OF FORGIVENESS THE PARDON AND PEACE HE SOUGHT CAME TO HIM AND IN SUCH SORT THAT THE COMFORT OF THAT DAY WHEN FRESH FROM THE FIRST SHOCK
7205-50138-0005 WAS SUCH AS NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN THEY LINKED THEMSELVES WITH THE GRAVE SHADE OF THE CLUSTERED GRAY COLUMNS AND THE ANGEL HEADS ON ROOF OF THAT OLD CHURCH
7205-50138-0006 HE WANDERED IN THE CHURCHYARD BETWEEN THE SERVICES ALL ENMITY TO PHILIP WAS ABSENT NOW AND HE FELT AS IF IT WOULD HARDLY RETURN WHEN HE STOOD BY THE GRAVES OF THE ARCHDEACON AND OF THE TWO FRANCES MORVILLES AND THOUGHT WHAT THAT SPOT WAS TO HIS COUSIN
7205-50138-0007 THERE WERE A FEW FLOWERS PLANTED ROUND MISSUS MORVILLE'S GRAVE BUT THEY SHOWED THAT THEY HAD LONG BEEN NEGLECTED AND NO SUCH SIGNS OF CARE MARKED HER DAUGHTER FANNY'S
7205-50138-0008 AND WHEN GUY FURTHER THOUGHT OF MISSUS HENLEY AND RECOLLECTED HOW PHILIP HAD SACRIFICED ALL HIS CHERISHED PROSPECTS AND HOPES OF DISTINCTION AND EMBRACED AN IRKSOME PROFESSION FOR THE SAKE OF THESE TWO SISTERS HE DID NOT FIND IT DIFFICULT TO EXCUSE THE STERNNESS SEVERITY AND DISTRUST WHICH WERE AN EVIDENCE
7205-50138-0009 IT WAS ON TRIAL AND HIS FAILURE HIS RETURN TO HIS OLD EVIL PASSIONS HAD SUNK HIM BENEATH HER HE SHUDDERED TO THINK OF HER BEING UNITED TO ANYTHING SO UNLIKE HERSELF AND WHICH MIGHT CAUSE HER SO MUCH MISERY
7205-50138-0010 AS SHE SAT AT HER MOTHER'S FEET THOUGH THAT REMEMBRANCE WAS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF MISERY BUT AMY WOULD BE TRANQUIL PURE AND GOOD WHATEVER BECAME OF HIM
7205-50138-0011 WITH BENDING HEAD FOLDED HANDS AND A STAR ON ITS BROW IN THE PARADISO OF FLAXMAN HER SERENITY WOULD BE UNTOUCHED AND THOUGH SHE MIGHT BE LOST TO HIM HE COULD STILL BE CONTENT WHILE HE COULD LOOK UP AT IT THROUGH HIS TURBID LIFE
7205-50138-0012 BETTER SHE WERE LOST TO HIM THAN THAT HER PEACE SHOULD BE INJURED HE STILL OF COURSE EARNESTLY LONGED TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE THOUGH HIS HOPES LESSENED FOR AS LONG AS THE EVIDENCE WAS WITHHELD HE HAD NO CHANCE
7205-50138-0013 AFTER WRITING AS STRONGLY AS HE COULD HE COULD DO NO MORE EXCEPT WATCH FOR SOMETHING THAT MIGHT UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY AND CHARLES'S WARM SYMPATHY AND READINESS TO ASSIST HIM WERE A GREAT COMFORT
7205-50138-0014 HE SAW MISSUS DIXON SITTING ON ONE OF THE BENCHES WHICH WERE PLACED ON THE PATHS CUT OUT ON THE SIDE OF THE HILL LOOKING VERY SMART AND SMILING AMONG SEVERAL PERSONS OF HER OWN CLASS TO BE ASHAMED TO RECOGNISE HER WAS A WEAKNESS BENEATH HIM
7205-50138-0015 HELD OUT HIS HAND TO HER SHE RAN UP TO HIM JOYFULLY AND HE LED HER A FEW STEPS FROM HER MOTHER'S PARTY WELL LITTLE ONE HOW ARE YOU I HAVE YOUR PIECE OF SPAR QUITE SAFE
7205-50138-0016 CALLED THE SOFT VOICE BUT IT NEEDED A WHISTLE FROM HIS MASTER TO BRING HIM TO BE CARESSED BY THE LITTLE GIRL
7205-50138-0017 BUT MAMMA SAYS SHE HAS GOT A BONE IN HER LEG AND CANNOT GO DO YOU THINK MAMMA WOULD GIVE YOU LEAVE TO GO UP WITH ME SHOULD YOU LIKE IT SHE COLOURED ALL OVER TOO HAPPY EVEN TO THANK HIM
7205-50138-0018 THEN SAID GUY TO HIS TUTOR I WILL MEET YOU HERE WHEN YOU HAVE DONE YOUR BUSINESS IN THE TOWN IN AN HOUR OR SO
7205-50138-0019 AS THE ASCENT BECAME STEEPER HER BREATH GREW SHORTER AND SHE TOILED ON IN A RESOLUTE UNCOMPLAINING MANNER AFTER HIS LONG VIGOROUS STEPS TILL HE LOOKED ROUND AND SEEING HER PANTING FAR BEHIND TURNED TO HELP HER
7205-50138-0020 LEAD HER AND CARRY HER TILL THE TOP WAS ACHIEVED AND THE LITTLE GIRL STOOD ON THE TOPMOST STONE GAZING ROUND AT THE BROAD SUNNY LANDSCAPE WITH THE SOFT GREEN MEADOWS
7205-50138-0021 WITH ITS OTHER PEAKS AND CAIRNS BROWN WITH WITHERED BRACKEN
7205-50138-0022 HE WATCHED HER IN SILENCE PLEASED AND CURIOUS TO OBSERVE HOW BEAUTIFUL A SCENE STRUCK THE CHILDISH EYE OF THE LITTLE LONDONER THE FIRST THING SHE SAID AFTER THREE OR FOUR MINUTES CONTEMPLATION A LONG TIME FOR SUCH A CHILD WAS
7205-50138-0023 OH I NEVER SAW ANYTHING SO PRETTY THEN PRESENTLY AFTER
7205-50138-0024 OH DO YOU KNOW ABOUT FELIX YOU SHALL TELL ME SAID GUY HERE SIT ON MY KNEE AND REST AFTER YOUR SCRAMBLE MAMMA NEVER LETS ME TALK OF FELIX BECAUSE IT MAKES HER CRY SAID MARIANNE BUT I WISH IT SOMETIMES
7205-50138-0025 HER LITTLE HEART WAS SOON OPEN IT APPEARED THAT FELIX WAS THE LAST WHO HAD DIED THE NEAREST IN AGE TO MARIANNE
7205-50138-0026 THOUGH TO GUY THEY SEEMED BUT THE VERY PROOF OF DREARINESS AND DINGINESS SHE TALKED OF WALKS TO SCHOOL WHEN FELIX WOULD TELL WHAT HE WOULD DO WHEN HE WAS A MAN AND HOW HE TOOK CARE OF HER AT THE CROSSINGS AND HOW RUDE BOYS USED TO DRIVE THEM
7205-50138-0027 AND HOW THEY WOULD LOOK IN AT THE SHOP WINDOWS AND SETTLE WHAT THEY WOULD BUY IF THEY WERE RICH THEN SHE TALKED OF HIS BEING ILL ILL SO VERY LONG HOW HE SAT IN HIS LITTLE CHAIR AND COULD NOT PLAY AND THEN ALWAYS LAY IN BED AND SHE LIKED TO SIT BY HIM THERE
7205-50138-0028 BUT AT LAST HE DIED AND THEY CARRIED HIM AWAY IN A GREAT BLACK COFFIN AND HE WOULD NEVER COME BACK AGAIN BUT IT WAS SO DULL NOW THERE WAS NO ONE TO PLAY WITH HER THOUGH THE LITTLE GIRL DID NOT CRY SHE LOOKED VERY MOURNFUL AND GUY TRIED TO COMFORT HER BUT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM
7205-50138-0029 STANDING UPON IT AND MAMMA READ IT WHEN FELIX DIED BUT IT WAS A BIG BOOK AND THE SHELL TURKEY COCK ALWAYS STOOD UPON IT IN SHORT IT SEEMED ONLY CONNECTED WITH MAMMA'S TEARS AND THE LOSS OF HER BROTHER
7205-50138-0030 WELLWOOD SAID HE BREAKING SILENCE WHEN THEY HAD WALKED ABOUT HALF WAY BACK TO THE FARM DO YOU THINK YOUR COUSIN WOULD DO ME A GREAT KINDNESS YOU SAW THAT CHILD
7205-50138-0031 ON WHAT TERMS WHAT SORT OF AN EDUCATION IS SHE TO HAVE THE CHIEF THING SHE WANTS IS TO BE TAUGHT CHRISTIANITY POOR CHILD THE REST MISS WELLWOOD MAY SETTLE SHE IS MY FIRST COUSIN I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH OUR FAMILY HISTORY
7205-50138-0032 UNTIL HIS FIVE AND TWENTIETH YEAR MIGHT PUT HIS PROPERTY IN HIS OWN POWER
7205-50138-0033 HE NEXT WENT TO MISSUS DIXON EXPECTING MORE DIFFICULTY WITH HER BUT HE FOUND NONE SHE THOUGHT IT BETTER MARIANNE SHOULD LIVE AT SAINT MILDRED'S THAN DIE IN LONDON
7205-50138-0034 AND WAS READY TO CATCH AT THE PROSPECT OF HER BEING FITTED FOR A GOVERNESS INDEED SHE WAS SO STRONGLY PERSUADED THAT THE RICH COUSIN MIGHT MAKE MARIANNE'S FORTUNE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY UNWILLING TO INTERFERE WITH THE FANCY HE HAD TAKEN FOR HER
