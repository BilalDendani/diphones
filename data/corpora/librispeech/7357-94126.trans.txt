7357-94126-0002 THE SINGING BROTHER ON THE MAINLAND APPEARED TO AMUSE HIM AND HE PAUSED TO LISTEN SAYING DAT YERE NIGGER HE GOT TOO LOUD VOICE THEN WHEN HE HAD LEFT OUR CAMP AND REGAINED THE TOP OF THE BANK HE LEANED UPON HIS HOE AND YELLED

7357-94126-0006 CHATTERING AWAY TO THEMSELVES LIKE MAGPIES AND KEEPING UP THEIR CONVERSATION BY SHOUTS WHEN SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER AT THE ENDS OF PLOW ROWS A NATURAL LEVEE
7357-94126-0007 EIGHT AND TEN FEET HIGH AND STUDDED WITH LARGE TREE WILLOWS RIMS IN THE ISLAND FARM LIKE THE EDGE OF A BASIN
7357-94126-0008 WE WERE TOLD THAT THIS SERVED AS A BARRIER ONLY AGAINST THE JUNE FRESH FOR THE REGULAR SPRING FLOODS INVARIABLY SWAMP THE PLACE BUT WHAT IS LEFT WITHIN THE BOWL WHEN THE OUTER WATERS SUBSIDE SOON LEACHES THROUGH THE SANDY SOIL
7357-94126-0009 AFTER PASSING THE PRETTY SHORES OF DOG ISLAND NOT FAR BELOW THE BOLD DARK HEADLAND OF CUMBERLAND ISLAND SOON BURSTS UPON OUR VIEW WE FOLLOW THE NARROW EASTERN CHANNEL IN ORDER TO GREET THE CUMBERLAND RIVER NINE HUNDRED NINE MILES WHICH HALF WAY DOWN ITS ISLAND NAME SAKE AT THE WOE BEGONE LITTLE VILLAGE OF SMITHLAND KENTUCY EMPTIES A GENEROUS
7357-94126-0010 FLOOD INTO THE OHIO THE CUMBERLAND PERHAPS A QUARTER OF A MILE WIDE DEBOUCHES THROUGH HIGH CLAY BANKS WHICH MIGHT READILY BE MELTED IN THE TURBULENT CROSS CURRENTS PRODUCED BY THE MINGLING OF THE RIVERS BUT TO AVOID THIS THE GOVERNMENT ENGINEERS HAVE BUILT A WING
7357-94126-0011 DAM RUNNING OUT FROM THE FOOT OF THE CUMBERLAND
7357-94126-0012 TO DAY STOPPING AT THE FARM LANDINGS AS WELL AS AT THE CRUDE AND INFREQUENT HAMLETS MERE NOTCHES OF SETTLEMENT IN THE WOODED LINES OF SHORE DOING A SMALL BUSINESS IN CHANCE CARGOES AND IN PASSENGERS WHO FLAG THEM FROM THE BANK
7357-94126-0013 A SULTRY ATMOSPHERE HAS BEEN WITH
7357-94126-0014 US THROUGH THE DAY THE GLASSY SURFACE OF THE RIVER HAS WHEN NOT LASHED INTO FOAM BY PASSING BOATS DAZZLED THE EYES MOST PAINFULLY THE HILLS FROM BELOW STEWART'S ISLAND HAVE RECEDED ON EITHER SIDE GENERALLY LEAVING EITHER LOW BROAD HEAVILY TIMBERED BOTTOMS OR HIGH CLAY BANKS WHICH STRETCH BACK WIDE PLAINS OF YELLOW AND GRAY CORN LAND FREQUENTLY INUNDATED BUT HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE
7357-94126-0015 NOW AND THEN THE ENCROACHING RIVER HAS REMAINED TOO LONG IN SOME BELT OF FOREST
7357-94126-0016 LIMB TIPS WITH VIRGINIA CREEPER A BIT OF SHALY HILLSIDE OCCASIONALLY ABUTS UPON THE RIVER THOUGH LESS FREQUENTLY THAN ABOVE
7357-94126-0017 WHEN SUFFICIENTLY REFRESHED IN THIS COOL BOWER WE VENTURED ONCE MORE INTO THE FIERCE LIGHT OF THE OPEN RIVER AND TWO MILES BELOW SHOT INTO THE BROADER AND MORE INVITING MASSAC
7357-94126-0018 ABANDONED NO DOUBT THE FACE OF THIS RUGGED PROMONTORY OF GRAVEL HAS WITHIN A CENTURY SUFFERED MUCH FROM FLOODS BUT THE REMAINS OF THE EARTHWORK ON THE CREST OF THE CLIFF SOME FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE PRESENT RIVER STAGE ARE STILL EASILY TRACEABLE THROUGHOUT
7357-94126-0019 THE FORT WAS ABOUT FORTY YARDS SQUARE WITH A BASTION AT EACH CORNER THERE ARE THE REMAINS OF AN UNSTONED WELL NEAR THE CENTER THE DITCH SURROUNDING THE EARTHWORK IS STILL SOME TWO AND A HALF OR THREE FEET BELOW THE SURROUNDING LEVEL
7357-94126-0020 AND THE BREASTWORK ABOUT TWO FEET ABOVE THE INNER LEVEL NO DOUBT PALISADES ONCE SURMOUNTED THE WORK AND WERE RELIED UPON AS THE CHIEF PROTECTION FROM ASSAULT
7357-94126-0021 THE GROUNDS A PLEASANT GRASSY GROVE SEVERAL ACRES IN EXTENT ARE NOW ENCLOSED BY A RAIL FENCE AND NEATLY MAINTAINED AS A PUBLIC PARK BY THE LITTLE CITY OF METROPOLIS WHICH LIES NOT FAR BELOW IT WAS A COMMANDING VIEW OF LAND AND RIVER WHICH WAS ENJOYED BY THE GARRISON OF OLD FORT MASSAC UP STREAM THERE IS A STRAIGHT STRETCH OF ELEVEN MILES TO THE MOUTH OF THE TENNESSEE
7357-94126-0022 BOTH UP AND DOWN THE SHORE LINES ARE UNDER FULL SURVEY UNTIL THEY MELT AWAY IN THE DISTANCE NO ENEMY COULD WELL SURPRISE THE HOLDERS OF THIS KEY TO THE LOWER OHIO
7357-94126-0023 AS THE STILL COOL NIGHT CREPT ON METROPOLIS WAS ASTIR ACROSS THE MILE OF INTERVENING WATER DARTED TREMULOUS SHAFTS OF LIGHT
7357-94126-0024 WE HEARD VOICES SINGING AND LAUGHING A FIDDLE IN ITS HIGHEST NOTES THE PUFFING OF A STATIONARY ENGINE AND THE BAY AND YELP OF COUNTLESS DOGS LATER A PACKET SWOOPED DOWN WITH SMOTHERED ROAR AND THREW ITS ELECTRIC SEARCH LIGHT ON THE CITY WHARF REVEALING A CROWD OF NEGROES GATHERED THERE
7357-94126-0025 LIKE MOTHS IN THE RADIANCE OF A CANDLE THERE WERE GAY SHOUTS AND A MAD SCAMPERING WE COULD SEE IT ALL AS PLAINLY AS IF IN ORDINARY LIGHT IT HAD BEEN
7357-94126-0026 THE FORT MASSAC RIDGE EXTENDS DOWN STREAM AS FAR AS MOUND CITY BUT SOON DEGENERATES INTO A RIDGE OF CLAY VARYING IN HEIGHT FROM TWENTY FIVE TO FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE WATER LEVEL UPON THE LOW LYING BOTTOM OF THE KENTUCKY SHORE IS STILL AN INTERMINABLE DARK LINE OF FOREST THE SETTLEMENTS ARE MEAGER AND NOW WHOLLY IN ILLINOIS
7357-94126-0027 A ROW OF A HALF DOZEN UNPAINTED DILAPIDATED BUILDINGS CHIEFLY STORES AND ABANDONED WAREHOUSES BESPEAKING A RIVER TRAFFIC OF THE OLDEN TIME THAT HAS GONE TO DECAY
7357-94126-0028 A HOT DREARY BAKING SPOT THIS JOPPA AS IT LIES SPRAWLING UPON THE CLAY RIDGE FLANKED BY A LOW WIDE GRAVEL BEACH ON WHICH GAUNT
7357-94126-0029 BELL RINGING COWS ARE WANDERING EATING THE LEAVES OF FALLEN TREES FOR LACK OF BETTER PASTURAGE

7357-94126-0032 THE VERY PICTURE OF DESOLATE DESPAIR BUT ON THE KENTUCKY SHORE ARE FEW SIGNS OF LIFE FOR THE BOTTOM LIES SO LOW THAT IT IS FREQUENTLY INUNDATED AND SETTLEMENT VENTURES NO NEARER THAN TWO OR THREE MILES FROM THE RIVERSIDE
7357-94126-0033 A FISHERMAN COMES OCCASIONALLY INTO VIEW UPON THIS WIDE EXPANSE OF WOOD AND WATER AND CLAY BANKS SOMETIMES WE HAIL HIM IN PASSING ALWAYS GETTING A RESPECTFUL ANSWER BUT A STARE OF INNOCENT CURIOSITY
7357-94126-0034 OUR LAST HOME UPON THE OHIO IS FACING THE KENTUCKY SHORE ON THE CLEANLY SAND BEACH OF MOUND CITY TOWHEAD A SMALL ISLAND WHICH IN TIMES OF HIGH WATER IS BUT A BAR
