4438-48513-0000 AND HE HAD OTHER THINGS TO SEE TO BESIDES HER AFFAIRS HIS OWN PATIENTS SCATTERED WIDELY OVER A LONELY COUNTRYSIDE WEMYSS HAD NOTHING TO SEE TO HE COULD CONCENTRATE ENTIRELY ON LUCY
4438-48513-0001 AND HE WAS HER FRIEND LINKED TO HER SO STRANGELY AND SO STRONGLY BY DEATH SHE FELT SHE HAD KNOWN HIM FOR EVER SHE FELT THAT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME SHE AND HE HAD BEEN ADVANCING HAND IN HAND
4438-48513-0002 TOWARDS JUST THIS PLACE TOWARDS JUST THIS HOUSE AND GARDEN TOWARDS JUST THIS YEAR THIS AUGUST THIS MOMENT OF EXISTENCE WEMYSS DROPPED QUITE NATURALLY INTO THE PLACE A NEAR MALE RELATIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN
4438-48513-0003 IF THERE HAD BEEN A NEAR MALE RELATIVE WITHIN REACH AND HIS RELIEF AT HAVING SOMETHING TO DO SOMETHING PRACTICAL AND IMMEDIATE WAS SO IMMENSE THAT NEVER WERE FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS MADE WITH GREATER ZEAL AND ENERGY
4438-48513-0004 REALLY ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY WITH GREATER GUSTO FRESH FROM THE HORRORS OF THOSE OTHER FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS CLOUDED AS THEY HAD BEEN BY THE SILENCES OF FRIENDS AND THE AVERTED LOOKS OF NEIGHBOURS ALL OWING TO THE IDIOTIC JURORS AND THEIR HESITATIONS
4438-48513-0005 AND THE VINDICTIVENESS OF THAT WOMAN BECAUSE HE CONCLUDED HE HAD REFUSED TO RAISE HER WAGES THE PREVIOUS MONTH WHAT HE WAS ARRANGING NOW WAS SO SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD
4438-48513-0006 THERE WERE NO ANXIETIES THERE WERE NO WORRIES AND THERE WAS A GRATEFUL LITTLE GIRL AFTER EACH FRUITFUL VISIT TO THE UNDERTAKER AND HE PAID SEVERAL IN HIS ZEAL HE CAME BACK TO LUCY AND SHE WAS GRATEFUL
4438-48513-0007 AND SHE WAS NOT ONLY GRATEFUL BUT VERY OBVIOUSLY GLAD TO GET HIM BACK HE SAW SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT WHEN HE WENT AWAY OFF ALONG THE TOP OF THE CLIFF ON HIS VARIOUS BUSINESS VISITS PURPOSE IN EACH STEP
4438-48513-0008 A DIFFERENT BEING FROM THE INDIGNANTLY MISERABLE PERSON WHO HAD DRAGGED ABOUT THAT VERY CLIFF KILLING TIME SUCH A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE HE COULD SEE SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT SHE KNEW HE HAD TO GO SHE WAS GRATEFUL AND IMMENSELY EXPRESSIVE OF HER GRATITUDE
4438-48513-0009 WEMYSS THOUGHT HE HAD NEVER MET ANY ONE SO EXPRESSIVELY GRATEFUL THAT HE SHOULD SO DILIGENTLY GO BUT SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT HE SAW SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT HE SAW THAT SHE CLUNG TO HIM AND IT PLEASED HIM
4438-48513-0010 DON'T BE LONG SHE MURMURED EACH TIME LOOKING AT HIM WITH EYES OF ENTREATY AND WHEN HE GOT BACK AND STOOD BEFORE HER AGAIN MOPPING HIS FOREHEAD HAVING TRIUMPHANTLY ADVANCED THE FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS ANOTHER STAGE
4438-48513-0011 AND SHE HAD THE RELIEVED EYES OF A CHILD WHO HAS BEEN LEFT ALONE IN THE DARK AND SEES ITS MOTHER COMING IN WITH A CANDLE VERA USEDN'T TO LOOK LIKE THAT VERA HAD ACCEPTED EVERYTHING HE DID FOR HER AS A MATTER OF COURSE
4438-48513-0012 NATURALLY HE WASN'T GOING TO LET THE POOR LITTLE GIRL SLEEP ALONE IN THAT HOUSE WITH A DEAD BODY AND THE STRANGE SERVANTS WHO HAD BEEN HIRED TOGETHER WITH THE HOUSE AND KNEW NOTHING EITHER ABOUT HER OR HER FATHER PROBABLY GETTING RESTIVE AS NIGHT DREW ON
4438-48513-0013 WHEN HE TOLD HER HE WAS GOING TO STAY THE NIGHT WAS SO GRATEFUL SO REALLY THANKFUL THAT HER EYES RED FROM THE WAVES OF GRIEF THAT HAD ENGULFED HER AT INTERVALS DURING THE AFTERNOON EVER SINCE THAT IS THE SIGHT OF HER DEAD FATHER LYING SO REMOTE FROM HER
4438-48513-0014 SO WRAPPED IT SEEMED IN A DEEP ABSORBED ATTENTIVENESS HAD UNFROZEN HER AND SWEPT HER AWAY INTO A SEA OF PASSIONATE WEEPING FILLED AGAIN WITH TEARS OH SHE MURMURED HOW GOOD YOU ARE
4438-48513-0015 IT WAS WEMYSS WHO HAD DONE ALL THE THINKING FOR HER AND IN THE SPARE MOMENTS BETWEEN HIS VISITS TO THE UNDERTAKER ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENTS AND TO THE DOCTOR ABOUT THE CERTIFICATE AND TO THE VICAR ABOUT THE BURIAL
4438-48513-0016 AND NOW THIS LAST INSTANCE OF HIS THOUGHTFULNESS OVERWHELMED HER SHE HAD BEEN DREADING THE NIGHT HARDLY DARING TO THINK OF IT SO MUCH DID SHE DREAD IT AND EACH TIME HE HAD GONE AWAY ON HIS ERRANDS
4438-48513-0017 THROUGH HER HEART CREPT THE THOUGHT OF WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE WHEN DUSK CAME AND HE WENT AWAY FOR THE LAST TIME AND SHE WOULD BE ALONE ALL ALONE IN THE SILENT HOUSE AND UPSTAIRS THAT STRANGE WONDERFUL ABSORBED THING THAT USED TO BE HER FATHER
4438-48513-0018 AND WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HER WHATEVER AWFUL HORROR OVERCAME HER IN THE NIGHT WHATEVER DANGER HE WOULDN'T HEAR HE WOULDN'T KNOW HE WOULD STILL LIE THERE CONTENT CONTENT
4438-48513-0019 HE ANSWERED AND THEY STARED AT EACH OTHER ASTONISHED AT THE NATURE OF THE BOND BETWEEN THEM AT ITS CLOSENESS AT THE WAY IT SEEMED ALMOST MIRACULOUSLY TO HAVE BEEN ARRANGED THAT THEY SHOULD MEET ON THE CREST OF DESPAIR AND SAVE EACH OTHER
4438-48513-0020 OF HIS LIFE AND OF THE REGULAR HEALTHY CALM WITH WHICH IT HAD PROCEEDED TILL A WEEK AGO WHY THIS CALM SHOULD HAVE BEEN INTERRUPTED AND SO CRUELLY HE COULDN'T IMAGINE IT WASN'T AS IF HE HAD DESERVED IT
4438-48513-0021 HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT A MAN COULD EVER BE JUSTIFIED IN SAYING HE HAD DONE GOOD BUT HE WEMYSS COULD AT LEAST FAIRLY SAY THAT HE HADN'T DONE ANY ONE ANY HARM OH BUT YOU HAVE DONE GOOD SAID LUCY
4438-48513-0022 ALWAYS ALWAYS I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING GOOD SHE SAID BEING KIND I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU ANYTHING ELSE BUT A HELP TO PEOPLE AND A COMFORT AND WEMYSS SAID WELL HE HAD DONE HIS BEST AND TRIED
4438-48513-0023 AND NO MAN COULD SAY MORE BUT JUDGING FROM WHAT WELL WHAT PEOPLE HAD SAID TO HIM IT HADN'T BEEN MUCH OF A SUCCESS SOMETIMES AND OFTEN AND OFTEN HE HAD BEEN HURT DEEPLY HURT BY BEING MISUNDERSTOOD AND LUCY SAID
4438-48513-0024 HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE TO MISUNDERSTAND HIM TO MISUNDERSTAND ANY ONE SO TRANSPARENTLY GOOD SO EVIDENTLY KIND
4438-48513-0025 ONE WOULD THINK HE WAS EASY ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND HE WAS A VERY NATURAL SIMPLE SORT OF PERSON WHO HAD ONLY ALL HIS LIFE ASKED FOR PEACE AND QUIET IT WASN'T MUCH TO ASK VERA WHO IS VERA ASKED LUCY MY WIFE
4438-48513-0026 AH DON'T SAID LUCY EARNESTLY TAKING HIS HAND VERY GENTLY IN HERS DON'T TALK OF THAT TO NIGHT PLEASE DON'T LET YOURSELF THINK OF IT IF I COULD ONLY ONLY FIND THE WORDS THAT WOULD COMFORT YOU
4438-48513-0027 AND WEMYSS SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T NEED WORDS
4438-48513-0028 CLINGING TO EACH OTHER ALONE IN THE DARK SO THEY TALKED ON IN SUBDUED VOICES AS PEOPLE DO WHO ARE IN SOME HOLY PLACE SITTING CLOSE TOGETHER LOOKING OUT AT THE STARLIT SEA DARKNESS AND COOLNESS GATHERING ROUND THEM
4438-48513-0029 AND THE GRASS SMELLING SWEETLY AFTER THE HOT DAY AND THE LITTLE WAVES SUCH A LONG WAY DOWN
4438-48513-0030 TWENTY TWO SAID LUCY YOU MIGHT JUST AS EASILY BE TWELVE HE SAID EXCEPT FOR THE SORTS OF THINGS YOU SAY IT'S MY HAIR SAID LUCY MY FATHER LIKED HE LIKED DON'T SAID WEMYSS
4438-48513-0031 IN HIS TURN TAKING HER HAND DON'T CRY AGAIN DON'T CRY ANY MORE TO NIGHT COME WE'LL GO IN IT'S TIME YOU WERE IN BED AND HE HELPED HER UP AND WHEN THEY GOT INTO THE LIGHT OF THE HALL HE SAW THAT SHE HAD THIS TIME
4438-48513-0032 SUCCESSFULLY STRANGLED HER TEARS GOOD NIGHT SHE SAID WHEN HE HAD LIT HER CANDLE FOR HER GOOD NIGHT AND GOD BLESS YOU GOD BLESS YOU SAID WEMYSS SOLEMNLY HOLDING HER HAND IN HIS GREAT WARM GRIP
4438-48513-0033 HE HAS SAID LUCY INDEED HE HAS ALREADY IN SENDING ME YOU AND SHE SMILED UP AT HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE HAD KNOWN HER AND HE TOO HAD THE FEELING THAT HE HAD KNOWN HER EVER SINCE HE COULD REMEMBER
4438-48513-0034 HE SAW HER SMILE AND THE DIFFERENCE IT MADE TO HER MARRED STAINED FACE SURPRISED HIM DO THAT AGAIN HE SAID STARING AT HER STILL HOLDING HER HAND DO WHAT ASKED LUCY SMILE SAID WEMYSS
4438-48513-0035 THEN SHE LAUGHED BUT THE SOUND OF IT IN THE SILENT BROODING HOUSE WAS SHOCKING OH SHE GASPED STOPPING SHORT HANGING HER HEAD APPALLED BY WHAT IT HAD SOUNDED LIKE REMEMBER
4438-48513-0036 YOU'RE TO GO TO SLEEP AND NOT THINK OF ANYTHING WEMYSS ORDERED AS SHE WENT SLOWLY UPSTAIRS
