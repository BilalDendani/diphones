1544-41167-0000 MET IN THE ROOMS OF THE HALL OF NOBILITY THERE WAS MUCH DISCUSSION AROUND THE GOVERNOR'S TABLE UNDER THE PORTRAIT OF THE TSAR THE NOBLES BOTH IN THE LARGER AND THE SMALLER ROOMS GROUPED THEMSELVES IN CAMPS
1544-41167-0001 AND FROM THEIR HOSTILE AND SUSPICIOUS GLANCES FROM THE SILENCE THAT FELL UPON THEM WHEN OUTSIDERS APPROACHED A GROUP AND FROM THE WAY THAT SOME WHISPERING TOGETHER RETREATED TO THE FARTHER CORRIDOR IT WAS EVIDENT THAT EACH SIDE HAD SECRETS FROM THE OTHER
1544-41167-0002 IN APPEARANCE THE NOBLEMEN WERE SHARPLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE OLD AND THE NEW THE OLD WERE FOR THE MOST PART EITHER IN OLD UNIFORMS OF THE NOBILITY
1544-41167-0003 BUTTONED UP CLOSELY WITH SPURS AND HATS OR IN THEIR OWN SPECIAL NAVAL CAVALRY INFANTRY OR OFFICIAL UNIFORMS THE UNIFORMS OF THE OLDER MEN WERE EMBROIDERED IN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY WITH EPAULETS ON THEIR SHOULDERS
1544-41167-0004 THEY WERE UNMISTAKABLY TIGHT AND SHORT IN THE WAIST AS THOUGH THEIR WEARERS HAD GROWN OUT OF THEM THE YOUNGER MEN WORE THE UNIFORM OF THE NOBILITY WITH LONG WAISTS AND BROAD SHOULDERS UNBUTTONED OVER WHITE WAISTCOATS
1544-41167-0005 OR UNIFORMS WITH BLACK COLLARS AND WITH THE EMBROIDERED BADGES OF JUSTICES OF THE PEACE
1544-41167-0006 BELONGED TO THE OLD PARTY AND SOME OF THE VERY OLDEST NOBLEMEN ON THE CONTRARY WERE WHISPERING WITH SVIAZHSKY AND WERE EVIDENTLY ARDENT PARTISANS OF THE NEW PARTY LEVIN STOOD IN THE SMALLER ROOM
1544-41167-0007 WHERE THEY WERE SMOKING AND TAKING LIGHT REFRESHMENTS CLOSE TO HIS OWN FRIENDS AND LISTENING TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING
1544-41167-0008 EXERTED ALL HIS INTELLIGENCE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS SAID SERGEY IVANOVITCH WAS THE CENTER ROUND WHICH THE OTHERS GROUPED THEMSELVES HE WAS LISTENING AT THAT MOMENT TO SVIAZHSKY AND HLIUSTOV
1544-41167-0009 THE MARSHAL OF ANOTHER DISTRICT WHO BELONGED TO THEIR PARTY HLIUSTOV WOULD NOT AGREE TO GO WITH HIS DISTRICT TO ASK SNETKOV TO STAND WHILE SVIAZHSKY WAS PERSUADING HIM TO DO SO AND SERGEY IVANOVITCH WAS APPROVING OF THE PLAN
1544-41167-0010 WIPING HIS LIPS WITH A PERFUMED HANDKERCHIEF OF BORDERED BATISTE WE ARE PLACING OUR FORCES HE SAID PULLING OUT HIS WHISKERS SERGEY IVANOVITCH AND LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION HE SUPPORTED SVIAZHSKY'S CONTENTION
1544-41167-0011 ONE DISTRICT'S ENOUGH AND SVIAZHSKY'S OBVIOUSLY OF THE OPPOSITION HE SAID WORDS EVIDENTLY INTELLIGIBLE TO ALL EXCEPT LEVIN WHY KOSTYA YOU HERE TOO
1544-41167-0012 HE ADDED TURNING TO LEVIN AND DRAWING HIS ARM THROUGH HIS LEVIN WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD INDEED TO BE CONVERTED BUT COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHAT THE POINT WAS
1544-41167-0013 TO STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HIS INABILITY TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE SHOULD BE ASKED TO STAND O SANCTA SIMPLICITAS SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH AND BRIEFLY AND CLEARLY HE EXPLAINED IT TO LEVIN
1544-41167-0014 THEN HE WOULD BE ELECTED WITHOUT A BALLOT THAT MUST NOT BE NOW EIGHT DISTRICTS HAD AGREED TO CALL UPON HIM IF TWO REFUSED TO DO SO SNETKOV MIGHT DECLINE TO STAND AT ALL
1544-41167-0015 THEY WERE EVEN SOME OF THEM GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM AND PURPOSELY TO LET HIM GET A GOOD MANY VOTES SO THAT THE ENEMY MIGHT BE THROWN OFF THE SCENT AND WHEN A CANDIDATE OF THE OTHER SIDE WAS PUT UP THEY TOO MIGHT GIVE HIM SOME VOTES
1544-41167-0016 LEVIN UNDERSTOOD TO SOME EXTENT BUT NOT FULLY AND WOULD HAVE PUT A FEW MORE QUESTIONS WHEN SUDDENLY EVERYONE BEGAN TALKING AND MAKING A NOISE AND THEY MOVED TOWARDS THE BIG ROOM WHAT IS IT EH WHOM
