7540-101262-0000 WHICH BLOSSOMED AND BORE FRUIT EACH NIGHT BUT EVERY MORNING THE FRUIT WAS GONE AND THE BOUGHS WERE BARE OF BLOSSOM WITHOUT ANYONE BEING ABLE TO DISCOVER WHO WAS THE THIEF AT LAST THE EMPEROR SAID TO HIS ELDEST SON
7540-101262-0001 AND SET OUT GAILY AT NIGHTFALL TO WATCH THE APPLE TREE BUT NO SOONER HAD HE LAIN HIMSELF DOWN THAN HIS EYES GREW HEAVY AND WHEN THE SUNBEAMS ROUSED HIM FROM HIS SLUMBERS THERE WAS NOT AN APPLE LEFT ON THE TREE NEXT CAME THE TURN OF THE YOUNGEST SON
7540-101262-0002 WHO MADE HIMSELF A COMFORTABLE BED UNDER THE APPLE TREE AND PREPARED HIMSELF TO SLEEP TOWARDS MIDNIGHT HE AWOKE
7540-101262-0003 THE NINTH FLUTTERED TO THE GROUND WHERE THE PRINCE LAY AND INSTANTLY WAS CHANGED INTO A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN MORE BEAUTIFUL FAR THAN ANY LADY IN THE EMPEROR'S COURT THE PRINCE AT ONCE FELL IN LOVE WITH HER AND THEY TALKED TOGETHER FOR SOME TIME
7540-101262-0004 THEN SHE CHANGED HERSELF BACK INTO A PEA HEN AND THE WHOLE NINE FLEW AWAY AS SOON AS THE SUN ROSE THE PRINCE ENTERED THE PALACE AND HELD OUT THE APPLE TO HIS FATHER WHO WAS REJOICED TO SEE IT AND PRAISED HIS YOUNGEST SON HEARTILY FOR HIS CLEVERNESS
7540-101262-0005 AND EVERYTHING PASSED AS BEFORE AND SO IT HAPPENED FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS AT LENGTH THE OTHER BROTHERS GREW ANGRY AT SEEING THAT HE NEVER CAME BACK WITHOUT BRINGING TWO GOLDEN APPLES WITH HIM AND THEY WENT TO CONSULT AN OLD WITCH WHO PROMISED TO SPY AFTER HIM
7540-101262-0006 THERE WAS A RUSH OF WINGS AND THE EIGHT PEA HENS SETTLED ON THE TREE WHILE THE NINTH BECAME A MAIDEN AND RAN TO GREET THE PRINCE THEN THE WITCH STRETCHED OUT HER HAND AND CUT OFF A LOCK OF THE MAIDEN'S HAIR AND IN AN INSTANT THE GIRL SPRANG UP
7540-101262-0007 A PEA HEN ONCE MORE SPREAD HER WINGS AND FLEW AWAY WHILE HER SISTERS
7540-101262-0008 AND WEPT HIS HEART OUT FOR HIS LOST LOVE THIS WENT ON FOR SOME TIME TILL THE PRINCE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER AND MADE UP HIS MIND HE WOULD SEARCH THE WORLD THROUGH FOR HER IN VAIN HIS FATHER TRIED TO PERSUADE HIM THAT HIS TASK WAS HOPELESS
7540-101262-0009 AND THROUGH THE BARS HE COULD SEE THE STREETS OF A TOWN AND EVEN THE PALACE THE PRINCE TRIED TO PASS IN BUT THE WAY WAS BARRED BY THE KEEPER OF THE GATE
7540-101262-0010 WHY HE WAS THERE AND HOW HE HAD LEARNT THE WAY AND HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER UNLESS THE EMPRESS HERSELF CAME AND GAVE HIM LEAVE A MESSAGE WAS SENT TO HER AND WHEN SHE STOOD AT THE GATE THE PRINCE THOUGHT
7540-101262-0011 FOR THERE WAS THE MAIDEN HE HAD LEFT HIS HOME TO SEEK AND SHE HASTENED TO HIM AND TOOK HIS HAND AND DREW HIM INTO THE PALACE IN A FEW DAYS THEY WERE MARRIED AND THE PRINCE FORGOT HIS FATHER AND HIS BROTHERS
7540-101262-0012 IF YOU WISH TO ENTER THE FIRST ELEVEN CELLARS SAID SHE YOU CAN BUT BEWARE OF EVEN UNLOCKING THE DOOR OF THE TWELFTH
7540-101262-0013 SOON GOT TIRED OF BEING BY HIMSELF AND BEGAN TO LOOK ABOUT FOR SOMETHING TO AMUSE HIM WHAT CAN THERE BE IN THAT TWELFTH CELLAR HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF WHICH I MUST NOT SEE AND HE WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND UNLOCKED THE DOORS ONE AFTER THE OTHER
7540-101262-0014 AND IN ANOTHER INSTANT THE KEY WAS TURNED AND THE CELLAR LAY OPEN BEFORE HIM IT WAS EMPTY SAVE FOR A LARGE CASK BOUND WITH IRON HOOPS AND OUT OF THE CASK A VOICE WAS SAYING ENTREATINGLY FOR GOODNESS SAKE BROTHER
7540-101262-0015 FETCH ME SOME WATER I AM DYING OF THIRST THE PRINCE WHO WAS VERY TENDER HEARTED BROUGHT SOME WATER AT ONCE AND PUSHED IT THROUGH A HOLE IN THE BARREL AND AS HE DID SO ONE OF THE IRON HOOPS BURST
7540-101262-0016 HE WAS TURNING AWAY WHEN A VOICE CRIED THE SECOND TIME BROTHER FOR PITY'S SAKE FETCH ME SOME WATER I'M DYING OF THIRST SO THE PRINCE WENT BACK AND BROUGHT SOME MORE WATER AND AGAIN A HOOP SPRANG
7540-101262-0017 AND FOR THE THIRD TIME THE VOICE STILL CALLED FOR WATER AND WHEN WATER WAS GIVEN IT THE LAST HOOP WAS RENT THE CASK FELL IN PIECES AND OUT FLEW A DRAGON WHO SNATCHED UP THE EMPRESS JUST AS SHE WAS RETURNING FROM HER WALK
7540-101262-0018 AND WHEN YOU ARE IN DANGER TWIST IT IN YOUR FINGERS AND I WILL COME THE PRINCE PICKED UP THE FISH AND THREW IT INTO THE WATER THEN HE TOOK OFF ONE OF ITS SCALES AS HE HAD BEEN TOLD AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET CAREFULLY WRAPPED IN A CLOTH
7540-101262-0019 TWIST IT IN YOUR FINGERS AND I WILL COME SO THE PRINCE UNFASTENED THE TRAP
7540-101262-0020 AND AS HE WAS GOING OVER THE MOUNTAIN HE PASSED A WOLF ENTANGLED IN A SNARE WHO BEGGED TO BE SET AT LIBERTY
7540-101262-0021 OH BROTHER ASKED THE PRINCE TELL ME IF YOU CAN WHERE THE DRAGON EMPEROR LIVES THE MAN TOLD HIM WHERE HE WOULD FIND THE PALACE AND HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE HIM TO GET THERE AND THE PRINCE THANKED HIM AND FOLLOWED HIS DIRECTIONS
7540-101262-0022 AS THE DRAGON MIGHT RETURN DIRECTLY SO THEY TOOK TWO HORSES OUT OF THE STABLE AND RODE AWAY AT LIGHTNING SPEED HARDLY WERE THEY OUT OF SIGHT OF THE PALACE THAN THE DRAGON CAME HOME AND FOUND THAT HIS PRISONER HAD FLOWN
7540-101262-0023 GIVE ME YOUR ADVICE WHAT SHALL I DO HAVE MY SUPPER AS USUAL OR SET OUT IN PURSUIT OF THEM EAT YOUR SUPPER WITH A FREE MIND FIRST ANSWERED THE HORSE AND FOLLOW THEM AFTERWARDS
7540-101262-0024 AND WHEN HE COULD EAT NO MORE HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND SET OUT AFTER THE FUGITIVES IN A SHORT TIME HE HAD COME UP WITH THEM AND AS HE SNATCHED THE EMPRESS OUT OF HER SADDLE HE SAID TO THE PRINCE THIS TIME I WILL FORGIVE YOU
7540-101262-0025 THERE CANNOT BE ANOTHER LIKE IT IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHERE DID YOU GET IT FROM AND HE ANSWERED THE WAY I GOT IT
7540-101262-0026 HE IS TWIN BROTHER TO MY OWN HORSE AND CAN FLY AS HIGH AS THE CLOUDS THEMSELVES BUT NO ONE CAN EVER GET THIS HORSE WITHOUT FIRST SERVING THE OLD WOMAN FOR THREE WHOLE DAYS AND BESIDES THE HORSES SHE HAS A FOAL AND ITS MOTHER
7540-101262-0027 HE WILL IN THE END GET THE CHOICE OF ANY HORSE AS A PRESENT FROM THE OLD WOMAN BUT IF HE FAILS TO KEEP THE FOAL AND ITS MOTHER SAFE ON ANY ONE OF THE THREE NIGHTS HIS HEAD WILL PAY THE NEXT DAY THE PRINCE WATCHED TILL THE DRAGON LEFT THE HOUSE
7540-101262-0028 AND THEN HE CREPT IN TO THE EMPRESS WHO TOLD HIM ALL SHE HAD LEARNT FROM HER GAOLER
7540-101262-0029 AND ON EVERY POST A MAN'S HEAD WAS STUCK ONE POST ONLY WAS EMPTY AND AS THEY PASSED IT CRIED OUT WOMAN GIVE ME THE HEAD I AM WAITING FOR THE OLD WOMAN MADE NO ANSWER
7540-101262-0030 ON THE SAME CONDITIONS AS YOU BUT NOT ONE WAS ABLE TO GUARD THE MARE BUT THE PRINCE DID NOT WAVER AND DECLARED HE WOULD ABIDE BY HIS WORDS
7540-101262-0031 AND THE COLT RAN BEHIND HE MANAGED TO KEEP HIS SEAT FOR A LONG TIME IN SPITE OF ALL HER EFFORTS TO THROW HIM BUT AT LENGTH HE GREW SO WEARY THAT HE FELL FAST ASLEEP AND WHEN HE WOKE HE FOUND HIMSELF SITTING ON A LOG
7540-101262-0032 THE SIGHT OF THE WATER BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE FISH WHOM HE HAD SAVED FROM DEATH AND HE HASTILY DREW THE SCALE FROM HIS POCKET IT HAD HARDLY TOUCHED HIS FINGERS WHEN THE FISH APPEARED IN THE STREAM BESIDE HIM
7540-101262-0033 BUT STRIKE THE WATER WITH THE HALTER AND SAY COME HERE O MARE OF THE MOUNTAIN WITCH AND SHE WILL COME THE PRINCE DID AS HE WAS BID AND THE MARE AND HER FOAL STOOD BEFORE HIM THEN HE PUT THE HALTER ROUND HER NECK AND RODE HER HOME
7540-101262-0034 NOT KNOWING THAT THE PRINCE HAD OVERHEARD HER SO WHEN IT BEGAN TO GROW DARK THE PRINCE MOUNTED THE MARE FOR THE SECOND TIME AND RODE INTO THE MEADOWS AND THE FOAL TROTTED BEHIND ITS MOTHER AGAIN HE MANAGED TO STICK ON TILL MIDNIGHT
7540-101262-0035 WHAT IS IT MY BROTHER ASKED THE FOX WHO INSTANTLY APPEARED BEFORE HIM THE OLD WITCH'S MARE HAS RUN AWAY FROM ME AND I DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR HER
7540-101262-0036 BUT STRIKE THE GROUND WITH A HALTER AND SAY COME HERE O MARE OF THE MOUNTAIN WITCH THE PRINCE DID SO AND IN A MOMENT THE FOX BECAME A MARE AND STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH THE LITTLE FOAL AT HER HEELS
7540-101262-0037 HE MOUNTED AND RODE BACK AND THE OLD WOMAN PLACED FOOD ON THE TABLE AND LED THE MARE BACK TO THE STABLE YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE TO THE FOXES AS I TOLD YOU SAID SHE STRIKING THE MARE WITH A STICK I DID GO TO THE FOXES REPLIED THE MARE BUT THEY ARE NO FRIENDS OF MINE
7540-101262-0038 AND BETRAYED ME WELL THIS TIME YOU HAD BETTER GO TO THE WOLVES

7540-101262-0044 AND THE OLD WOMAN WAS FORCED TO LET HIM HAVE HIS WAY SO HE TOOK LEAVE OF HER AND PUT THE HALTER ROUND HIS HORSE'S NECK AND LED HIM INTO THE FOREST WHERE HE RUBBED HIM DOWN TILL HIS SKIN WAS SHINING LIKE GOLD THEN HE MOUNTED
7540-101262-0045 HE SAID TO HIS HORSE WHAT SHALL WE DO
7540-101262-0046 OR SHALL WE FOLLOW THE RUNAWAYS AND THE HORSE REPLIED WHETHER YOU EAT OR DON'T EAT DRINK OR DON'T DRINK FOLLOW THEM OR STAY AT HOME MATTERS NOTHING NOW FOR YOU CAN NEVER NEVER CATCH THEM
