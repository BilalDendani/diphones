8321-274737-0025 SHOULD SHE BE TRUE TO EARLE SAY SHE LOVED HIM AND SO LOSE THE CHANCE OF WINNING THIS LOVE FROM A LORD

8321-274737-0037 BUT IT IS SO COSTLY IT IS SO VERY VALUABLE
8321-274737-0038 I SHOULD BE SO HAPPY IF YOU WOULD WEAR IT IT IS THE FIRST TIME A JEWEL HAS GIVEN ME SUCH PLEASURE HOW CAN I WEAR SUCH A SPLENDID RING SHE SAID EVERY ONE WHO SEES IT WILL WONDER WHERE IT CAME FROM YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT HE REPLIED YOU ARE SO CLEVER
8321-274737-0039 I CANNOT DOUBT YOUR SKILL SAY YOU WILL ACCEPT IT DORIS SHE WAS QUITE SILENT FOR SOME MINUTES THEN A LOW VOICE WHISPERED TO HER I WILL HANG JEWELS MORE COSTLY THAN THIS ON YOUR BEAUTIFUL NECK AND ROUND YOUR WHITE ARMS YOU SHALL BE CROWNED WITH DIAMONDS IF YOU WILL
