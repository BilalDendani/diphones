5152-81825-0009 AS IT CAME OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD JUST AS SURPRISING AS THOUGH HE WERE LISTENING TO IT
5152-81825-0010 THERE WAS A PRINCE IN THAT TALE AND HE KILLED DRAGONS BUT ONLY FOR ONE NIGHT EVER AFTERWARDS GEORGIE DUBBED HIMSELF PRINCE PASHA GIANT KILLER AND ALL THE REST
5152-81825-0011 YOU SEE HE COULD NOT TELL ANY ONE FOR FEAR OF BEING LAUGHED AT AND HIS TALES FADED GRADUALLY INTO DREAMLAND WHERE ADVENTURES WERE SO MANY THAT HE COULD NOT RECALL THE HALF OF THEM
5152-81825-0012 THEY ALL BEGAN IN THE SAME WAY OR AS GEORGIE EXPLAINED TO THE SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT LIGHT THERE WAS THE SAME STARTING OFF PLACE A PILE OF BRUSHWOOD STACKED SOMEWHERE NEAR A BEACH
5152-81825-0013 AND ROUND THIS PILE GEORGIE FOUND HIMSELF RUNNING RACES WITH LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS THESE ENDED SHIPS RAN HIGH UP THE DRY LAND AND OPENED INTO CARDBOARD BOXES
5152-81825-0014 OR GILT AND GREEN IRON RAILINGS THAT SURROUNDED BEAUTIFUL GARDENS TURNED ALL SOFT AND COULD BE WALKED THROUGH AND OVERTHROWN SO LONG AS HE REMEMBERED IT WAS ONLY A DREAM
5152-81825-0015 AND INSTEAD OF PUSHING DOWN HOUSES FULL OF GROWN UP PEOPLE A JUST REVENGE HE SAT MISERABLY UPON GIGANTIC DOOR STEPS TRYING TO SING THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE UP TO FOUR TIMES SIX
5152-81825-0016 THE PRINCESS OF HIS TALES WAS A PERSON OF WONDERFUL BEAUTY SHE CAME FROM THE OLD ILLUSTRATED EDITION OF GRIMM NOW OUT OF PRINT
5152-81825-0017 AND AS SHE ALWAYS APPLAUDED GEORGIE'S VALOUR AMONG THE DRAGONS AND BUFFALOES HE GAVE HER THE TWO FINEST NAMES HE HAD EVER HEARD IN HIS LIFE ANNIE AND LOUISE
5152-81825-0018 IN A REAL SEA BY HIS NURSE AND HE SAID AS HE SANK POOR ANNIEANLOUISE SHE'LL BE SORRY FOR ME NOW BUT ANNIEANLOUISE WALKING SLOWLY ON THE BEACH CALLED

5152-81825-0020 AND HE WADED OUT WITH A TWELVE INCH FLOWER POT ON EACH FOOT AS HE WAS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN TO MEDDLE WITH FLOWER POTS IN REAL LIFE HE FELT TRIUMPHANTLY WICKED
5152-81825-0021 BUT DID NOT PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND REMOVED HIS WORLD WHEN HE WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD TO A PLACE CALLED OXFORD ON A VISIT HERE WERE HUGE BUILDINGS SURROUNDED BY VAST PRAIRIES
5152-81825-0022 WITH STREETS OF INFINITE LENGTH AND ABOVE ALL SOMETHING CALLED THE BUTTERY WHICH GEORGIE WAS DYING TO SEE BECAUSE HE KNEW IT MUST BE GREASY AND THEREFORE DELIGHTFUL
5152-81825-0023 HE PERCEIVED HOW CORRECT WERE HIS JUDGMENTS WHEN HIS NURSE LED HIM THROUGH A STONE ARCH INTO THE PRESENCE OF AN ENORMOUSLY FAT MAN WHO ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE SOME BREAD AND CHEESE GEORGIE WAS USED TO EAT
5152-81825-0024 AND WOULD HAVE TAKEN SOME BROWN LIQUID CALLED
5152-81825-0025 PEPPER'S GHOST THIS WAS INTENSELY THRILLING
5152-81825-0026 WHILE MISTER PEPPER HIMSELF BEYOND QUESTION A MAN OF THE WORST WAVED HIS ARMS AND FLAPPED A LONG GOWN AND IN A DEEP BASS VOICE GEORGIE HAD NEVER HEARD A MAN SING BEFORE TOLD OF HIS SORROWS UNSPEAKABLE
5152-81825-0027 SOME GROWN UP OR OTHER TRIED TO EXPLAIN THAT THE ILLUSION WAS MADE WITH MIRRORS AND THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO BE FRIGHTENED GEORGIE DID NOT KNOW WHAT ILLUSIONS WERE
5152-81825-0028 WAS JUST SAYING THINGS AFTER THE DISTRESSING CUSTOM OF GROWN UPS AND GEORGIE CAST ABOUT FOR AMUSEMENT BETWEEN SCENES NEXT TO HIM SAT A LITTLE GIRL DRESSED ALL IN BLACK

5152-81825-0035 I AM NOT AFRAID TRULY SAID THE BOY WRIGGLING IN DESPAIR BUT WHY DON'T YOU GO TO SLEEP IN THE AFTERNOONS SAME AS PROVOST OF ORIEL
5152-81825-0036 GEORGIE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO A GROWN UP OF THAT NAME WHO SLEPT IN HIS PRESENCE WITHOUT APOLOGY GEORGIE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT GROWN UP IN OXFORD HENCE
5152-81825-0037 HE STROVE TO GILD HIS REBUKE WITH FLATTERIES THIS GROWN UP DID NOT SEEM TO LIKE IT BUT HE COLLAPSED
5152-81825-0038 MISTER PEPPER WAS SINGING AGAIN AND THE DEEP RINGING VOICE THE RED FIRE
