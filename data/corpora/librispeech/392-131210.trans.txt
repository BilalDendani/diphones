392-131210-0000 WHEN HE GOT INTO THE YARD HE FOUND THE STABLE DOOR JUST OPENED I'M THE EARLY BIRD I THINK HE SAID TO HIMSELF I HOPE I SHALL CATCH THE WORM HE WOULD NOT ASK ANY ONE TO HELP HIM
392-131210-0001 FEARING HIS PROJECT MIGHT MEET WITH DISAPPROVAL AND OPPOSITION WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY BUT WITH THE HELP OF A BROKEN CHAIR HE BROUGHT DOWN FROM HIS BEDROOM HE MANAGED TO PUT THE HARNESS ON DIAMOND
392-131210-0002 IF THE OLD HORSE HAD HAD THE LEAST OBJECTION TO THE PROCEEDING OF COURSE HE COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT BUT EVEN WHEN IT CAME TO THE BRIDLE HE OPENED HIS MOUTH FOR THE BIT JUST AS IF HE HAD BEEN TAKING THE APPLE WHICH DIAMOND SOMETIMES GAVE HIM HE
392-131210-0003 FASTENED THE CHEEK STRAP VERY CAREFULLY JUST IN THE USUAL HOLE FOR FEAR OF CHOKING HIS FRIEND OR ELSE LETTING THE BIT GET AMONGST HIS TEETH IT WAS A JOB TO GET THE SADDLE ON
392-131210-0004 BUT WITH THE CHAIR HE MANAGED IT IF OLD DIAMOND HAD HAD AN EDUCATION IN PHYSICS TO EQUAL THAT OF THE CAMEL HE WOULD HAVE KNELT DOWN TO LET HIM PUT IT ON HIS BACK BUT THAT WAS MORE THAN COULD BE EXPECTED OF HIM
392-131210-0005 AND THEN DIAMOND HAD TO CREEP QUITE UNDER HIM TO GET HOLD OF THE GIRTH THE COLLAR WAS ALMOST THE WORST PART OF THE BUSINESS BUT THERE DIAMOND COULD HELP DIAMOND
392-131210-0006 HE HELD HIS HEAD VERY LOW TILL HIS LITTLE MASTER HAD GOT IT OVER AND TURNED IT ROUND AND THEN HE LIFTED HIS HEAD AND SHOOK IT ON TO HIS SHOULDERS THE YOKE WAS RATHER DIFFICULT BUT WHEN HE HAD LAID THE TRACES OVER THE HORSE'S NECK
392-131210-0007 GOT THEM UP ONE AFTER THE OTHER INTO THE LOOPS FASTENED THE TRACES THE BELLY BAND THE BREECHING AND THE REINS THEN HE GOT HIS WHIP THE MOMENT HE MOUNTED THE BOX THE MEN BROKE INTO A HEARTY CHEER OF DELIGHT AT HIS SUCCESS
392-131210-0008 BUT THEY WOULD NOT LET HIM GO WITHOUT A GENERAL INSPECTION OF THE HARNESS AND ALTHOUGH THEY FOUND IT RIGHT FOR NOT A BUCKLE HAD TO BE SHIFTED THEY NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO DO IT FOR HIMSELF AGAIN ALL THE TIME HIS FATHER WAS ILL
392-131210-0009 THE CHEER BROUGHT HIS MOTHER TO THE WINDOW AND THERE SHE SAW HER LITTLE BOY SETTING OUT ALONE WITH THE CAB IN THE GRAY OF MORNING SHE TUGGED AT THE WINDOW BUT IT WAS STIFF AND BEFORE SHE COULD OPEN IT
392-131210-0010 DIAMOND WHO WAS IN A GREAT HURRY WAS OUT OF THE MEWS AND ALMOST OUT OF THE STREET SHE CALLED DIAMOND DIAMOND BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER EXCEPT FROM JACK NEVER FEAR FOR HIM MA'AM SAID JACK

392-131210-0013 HOW'S THE GOV'NOR TO DAY MA'AM A GOOD DEAL BETTER THANK YOU SHE ANSWERED CLOSING THE WINDOW IN SOME FEAR LEST HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE ANXIOUS BY THE NEWS OF DIAMOND'S EXPEDITION HE KNEW PRETTY WELL HOWEVER WHAT HIS BOY WAS CAPABLE OF
392-131210-0014 AND ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE EASY WAS LESS ANXIOUS THAN HIS MOTHER BUT AS THE EVENING DREW ON THE ANXIETY OF BOTH OF THEM INCREASED AND EVERY SOUND OF WHEELS MADE HIS FATHER RAISE HIMSELF IN HIS BED AND HIS MOTHER PEEP OUT OF THE WINDOW
392-131210-0015 DIAMOND HAD RESOLVED TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE CAB STAND WHERE HE WAS BEST KNOWN AND NEVER TO CRAWL FOR FEAR OF GETTING ANNOYED BY IDLERS BEFORE HE GOT ACROSS OXFORD STREET HOWEVER HE WAS HAILED BY A MAN WHO WANTED TO CATCH A TRAIN
392-131210-0016 AND WAS IN TOO GREAT A HURRY TO THINK ABOUT THE DRIVER HAVING CARRIED HIM TO KING'S CROSS IN GOOD TIME AND GOT A GOOD FARE IN RETURN HE SET OFF AGAIN IN GREAT SPIRITS AND REACHED THE STAND IN SAFETY HE WAS THE FIRST THERE AFTER ALL
392-131210-0017 AS THE MEN ARRIVED THEY ALL GREETED HIM KINDLY AND INQUIRED AFTER HIS FATHER AIN'T YOU AFRAID OF THE OLD OSS RUNNING AWAY WITH YOU ASKED ONE NO HE WOULDN'T RUN AWAY WITH ME
392-131210-0018 OR IF HE DID HE WOULD ONLY RUN HOME WELL YOU'RE A PLUCKY ONE FOR ALL YOUR GIRL'S LOOKS
392-131210-0019 I'LL DO WHAT I CAN I CAME TO THE OLD PLACE YOU SEE BECAUSE I KNEW YOU WOULD LET ME HAVE MY TURN HERE IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY ONE MAN DID TRY TO CUT HIM OUT BUT HE WAS A STRANGER AND THE SHOUT THE REST OF THEM RAISED
392-131210-0020 LET HIM SEE IT WOULD NOT DO AND MADE HIM SO FAR ASHAMED BESIDES THAT HE WENT AWAY CRAWLING ONCE IN A BLOCK A POLICEMAN CAME UP TO HIM AND ASKED HIM FOR HIS NUMBER
392-131210-0021 DIAMOND SHOWED HIM HIS FATHER'S BADGE SAYING WITH A SMILE FATHER'S ILL AT HOME AND SO I CAME OUT WITH THE CAB THERE'S NO FEAR OF ME I CAN DRIVE BESIDES THE OLD HORSE COULD GO ALONE
392-131210-0022 JUST AS WELL I DARESAY YOU'RE A PAIR OF EM BUT YOU ARE A RUM UN FOR A CABBY AIN'T YOU NOW SAID THE POLICEMAN I DON'T KNOW AS I OUGHT TO LET YOU GO I AIN'T DONE NOTHING

392-131210-0024 AND TURNING HIS HEAD LIKE A LITTLE BIRD WHY HOW ARE YOU TO GET OUT OF THIS RUCK NOW WHEN IT BEGINS TO MOVE JUST YOU GET UP ON THE BOX SAID DIAMOND AND I'LL SHOW YOU
392-131210-0025 THERE THAT VAN'S A MOVING NOW JUMP UP THE POLICEMAN DID AS DIAMOND TOLD HIM AND WAS SOON SATISFIED THAT THE LITTLE FELLOW COULD DRIVE WELL HE SAID AS HE GOT DOWN AGAIN
392-131210-0026 GOOD LUCK TO YOU MY LITTLE MAN THANK YOU SIR SAID DIAMOND AND DROVE AWAY IN A FEW MINUTES A GENTLEMAN HAILED HIM ARE YOU THE DRIVER OF THIS CAB HE ASKED

392-131210-0028 NEVER MIND ME I SHALL SOON GET ANOTHER FARE I'LL RISK IT SAID THE GENTLEMAN AND OPENING THE DOOR HIMSELF HE JUMPED IN HE WAS GOING A GOOD DISTANCE AND SOON FOUND THAT DIAMOND GOT HIM OVER THE GROUND WELL
392-131210-0029 NOW WHEN DIAMOND HAD ONLY TO GO STRAIGHT AHEAD AND HAD NOT TO MIND SO MUCH WHAT HE WAS ABOUT HIS THOUGHTS ALWAYS TURNED TO THE RIDDLE MISTER RAYMOND HAD SET HIM
392-131210-0030 HE HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF FINDING IT OUT FOR HIMSELF AND HE COULD NOT PLAGUE HIS FATHER ABOUT IT WHEN HE WAS ILL HE HAD THOUGHT OF THE ANSWER HIMSELF BUT FANCIED IT COULD NOT BE THE RIGHT ONE
392-131210-0031 FOR TO SEE HOW IT ALL FITTED REQUIRED SOME KNOWLEDGE OF PHYSIOLOGY SO WHEN HE REACHED THE END OF HIS JOURNEY HE GOT DOWN VERY QUICKLY AND WITH HIS HEAD JUST LOOKING IN AT THE WINDOW SAID AS THE GENTLEMAN GATHERED HIS GLOVES AND NEWSPAPERS
392-131210-0032 PLEASE SIR CAN YOU TELL ME THE MEANING OF A RIDDLE YOU MUST TELL ME THE RIDDLE FIRST ANSWERED THE GENTLEMAN AMUSED DIAMOND REPEATED THE RIDDLE OH THAT'S EASY ENOUGH HE RETURNED IT'S A TREE

392-131210-0039 IT'LL HELP FATHER TO GET WELL AGAIN IT WILL I HOPE IT MAY MY MAN I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF YOU'RE AS GOOD AS YOU LOOK AFTER ALL AS DIAMOND RETURNED
392-131210-0040 IT WAS TIME TO GIVE DIAMOND HIS BAG OF CHOPPED BEANS AND OATS THE MEN GOT ABOUT HIM AND BEGAN TO CHAFF HIM HE TOOK IT ALL GOOD HUMOUREDLY UNTIL ONE OF THEM
392-131210-0041 WHO WAS AN ILL CONDITIONED FELLOW BEGAN TO TEASE OLD DIAMOND BY POKING HIM ROUGHLY IN THE RIBS AND MAKING GENERAL GAME OF HIM THAT HE COULD NOT BEAR AND THE TEARS CAME IN HIS EYES HE UNDID THE NOSE BAG

392-131210-0055 BEGINNING TO GET BETTER THAT OR SOMETHING ELSE ANSWERED DIAMOND SO VERY QUIETLY THAT HIS MOTHER HELD HIS HEAD BACK AND STARED IN HIS FACE WELL OF ALL THE CHILDREN SHE SAID AND SAID NO MORE
392-131210-0056 BUT TO SEE HER FACE AS HE POURED THE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCES AND PENCE INTO HER LAP SHE BURST OUT CRYING A SECOND TIME AND RAN WITH THE MONEY TO HER HUSBAND
