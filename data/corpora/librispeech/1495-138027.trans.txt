1495-138027-0000 TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS WORTH KNOWING AND TELLING
1495-138027-0001 AS TO WHAT SENOR SAMSON SAID THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW BY WHOM OR HOW OR WHEN MY ASS WAS STOLEN I SAY IN REPLY THAT THE SAME NIGHT WE WENT INTO THE SIERRA MORENA FLYING FROM THE HOLY BROTHERHOOD
1495-138027-0002 AFTER THAT UNLUCKY ADVENTURE OF THE GALLEY SLAVES AND THE OTHER OF THE CORPSE THAT WAS GOING TO SEGOVIA MY MASTER AND I ENSCONCED OURSELVES IN A THICKET AND THERE MY MASTER LEANING ON HIS LANCE AND I SEATED ON MY DAPPLE
1495-138027-0003 BATTERED AND WEARY WITH THE LATE FRAYS WE FELL ASLEEP AS IF IT HAD BEEN ON FOUR FEATHER MATTRESSES AND I IN PARTICULAR SLEPT SO SOUND THAT WHOEVER HE WAS
1495-138027-0004 HE WAS ABLE TO COME AND PROP ME UP ON FOUR STAKES WHICH HE PUT UNDER THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE PACK SADDLE IN SUCH A WAY THAT HE LEFT ME MOUNTED ON IT AND TOOK AWAY DAPPLE FROM UNDER ME WITHOUT MY FEELING IT
1495-138027-0005 AND IT IS NO NEW OCCURRENCE FOR THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO SACRIPANTE AT THE SIEGE OF ALBRACCA THE FAMOUS THIEF BRUNELLO BY THE SAME CONTRIVANCE TOOK HIS HORSE
1495-138027-0006 FROM BETWEEN HIS LEGS
1495-138027-0007 AND THE MOMENT I STIRRED THE STAKES GAVE WAY AND I FELL TO THE GROUND WITH A MIGHTY COME DOWN I LOOKED ABOUT FOR THE ASS BUT COULD NOT SEE HIM
1495-138027-0008 THE TEARS RUSHED TO MY EYES AND I RAISED SUCH A LAMENTATION THAT IF THE AUTHOR OF OUR HISTORY HAS NOT PUT IT IN HE MAY DEPEND UPON IT HE HAS LEFT OUT A GOOD THING
1495-138027-0009 SOME DAYS AFTER I KNOW NOT HOW MANY TRAVELLING WITH HER LADYSHIP THE PRINCESS MICOMICONA
1495-138027-0010 THE GREAT ROGUE AND RASCAL THAT MY MASTER AND I FREED FROM THE CHAIN THAT IS NOT WHERE THE MISTAKE IS REPLIED SAMSON
1495-138027-0011 THAT BEFORE THE ASS HAS TURNED UP THE AUTHOR SPEAKS OF SANCHO AS BEING MOUNTED ON IT
1495-138027-0012 UNLESS THAT THE HISTORIAN MADE A MISTAKE OR PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE A BLUNDER OF THE PRINTER'S NO DOUBT THAT'S IT SAID SAMSON BUT WHAT BECAME OF THE HUNDRED CROWNS DID THEY VANISH
1495-138027-0013 AND MY WIFE'S AND MY CHILDREN'S AND IT IS THEY THAT HAVE MADE MY WIFE BEAR SO PATIENTLY ALL MY WANDERINGS ON HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS IN THE SERVICE OF MY MASTER
1495-138027-0014 IF AFTER ALL THIS TIME I HAD COME BACK TO THE HOUSE WITHOUT A RAP AND WITHOUT THE ASS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A POOR LOOK OUT FOR ME AND IF ANYONE WANTS TO KNOW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT ME HERE I AM READY TO ANSWER
1495-138027-0015 THE KING HIMSELF IN PERSON AND IT IS NO AFFAIR OF ANYONE'S WHETHER I TOOK OR DID NOT TAKE WHETHER I SPENT OR DID NOT SPEND FOR THE WHACKS THAT WERE GIVEN ME IN THESE JOURNEYS WERE TO BE PAID FOR IN MONEY
1495-138027-0016 EVEN IF THEY WERE VALUED AT NO MORE THAN FOUR MARAVEDIS APIECE ANOTHER HUNDRED CROWNS WOULD NOT PAY ME FOR HALF OF THEM LET EACH LOOK TO HIMSELF AND NOT TRY TO MAKE OUT
1495-138027-0017 WHITE BLACK AND BLACK WHITE FOR EACH OF US IS AS GOD MADE HIM AYE AND OFTEN WORSE I WILL TAKE CARE SAID CARRASCO TO IMPRESS UPON THE AUTHOR OF THE HISTORY THAT IF HE PRINTS IT AGAIN HE MUST NOT FORGET
1495-138027-0018 WHAT WORTHY SANCHO HAS SAID FOR IT WILL RAISE IT A GOOD SPAN HIGHER
1495-138027-0019 THE SAME IMPORTANCE AS THOSE I HAVE MENTIONED DOES THE AUTHOR PROMISE A SECOND PART AT ALL
1495-138027-0020 NOR DOES HE KNOW WHO HAS GOT IT AND WE CANNOT SAY WHETHER IT WILL APPEAR OR NOT AND SO ON THAT HEAD AS SOME SAY THAT NO SECOND PART HAS EVER BEEN GOOD
1495-138027-0021 THOUGH SOME WHO ARE JOVIAL RATHER THAN SATURNINE SAY LET US HAVE MORE
1495-138027-0022 AND NO MATTER WHAT IT MAY TURN OUT WE SHALL BE SATISFIED WITH THAT AND WHAT DOES THE AUTHOR MEAN TO DO
1495-138027-0023 WHICH HE IS NOW SEARCHING FOR WITH EXTRAORDINARY DILIGENCE HE WILL AT ONCE GIVE IT TO THE PRESS MOVED MORE BY THE PROFIT THAT MAY ACCRUE TO HIM FROM DOING SO THAN BY ANY THOUGHT OF PRAISE
1495-138027-0024 IT WILL BE A WONDER IF HE SUCCEEDS FOR IT WILL BE ONLY HURRY HURRY WITH HIM LIKE THE TAILOR ON EASTER EVE AND WORKS DONE IN A HURRY ARE NEVER FINISHED AS PERFECTLY AS THEY OUGHT TO BE
1495-138027-0025 AND MY MASTER WILL GIVE HIM AS MUCH GROUTING READY TO HIS HAND IN THE WAY OF ADVENTURES AND ACCIDENTS OF ALL SORTS AS WOULD MAKE UP NOT ONLY ONE SECOND PART BUT A HUNDRED THE GOOD MAN FANCIES NO DOUBT THAT WE ARE
1495-138027-0026 BUT LET HIM HOLD UP OUR FEET TO BE SHOD AND HE WILL SEE WHICH FOOT IT IS WE GO LAME ON ALL I SAY IS THAT IF MY MASTER WOULD TAKE MY ADVICE WE WOULD BE NOW AFIELD REDRESSING OUTRAGES AND RIGHTING WRONGS
1495-138027-0027 AS IS THE USE AND CUSTOM OF GOOD KNIGHTS ERRANT
1495-138027-0028 ACCEPTED AS A HAPPY OMEN AND HE RESOLVED TO MAKE ANOTHER SALLY IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS FROM THAT TIME ANNOUNCING HIS INTENTION TO THE BACHELOR HE ASKED HIS ADVICE AS TO THE QUARTER IN WHICH HE OUGHT TO COMMENCE HIS EXPEDITION
1495-138027-0029 AND THE BACHELOR REPLIED THAT IN HIS OPINION HE OUGHT TO GO TO THE KINGDOM OF ARAGON AND THE CITY OF SARAGOSSA WHERE THERE WERE TO BE CERTAIN SOLEMN JOUSTINGS AT THE FESTIVAL OF SAINT GEORGE AT WHICH HE MIGHT WIN RENOWN ABOVE ALL THE KNIGHTS OF ARAGON
1495-138027-0030 WHICH WOULD BE WINNING IT ABOVE ALL THE KNIGHTS OF THE WORLD HE COMMENDED HIS VERY PRAISEWORTHY AND GALLANT RESOLUTION BUT ADMONISHED HIM TO PROCEED WITH GREATER CAUTION IN ENCOUNTERING DANGERS BECAUSE HIS LIFE DID NOT BELONG TO HIM
1495-138027-0031 BUT TO ALL THOSE WHO HAD NEED OF HIM TO PROTECT AND AID THEM IN THEIR MISFORTUNES THERE'S WHERE IT IS WHAT I ABOMINATE SENOR SAMSON
1495-138027-0032 MY MASTER WILL ATTACK A HUNDRED ARMED MEN AS A GREEDY BOY WOULD HALF A DOZEN MELONS BODY OF THE WORLD SENOR BACHELOR THERE IS A TIME TO ATTACK AND A TIME TO RETREAT
1495-138027-0033 SANTIAGO AND CLOSE SPAIN
1495-138027-0034 THAT THE MEAN OF VALOUR LIES BETWEEN
1495-138027-0035 OR TO ATTACK WHEN THE ODDS MAKE IT BETTER NOT BUT ABOVE ALL THINGS I WARN MY MASTER THAT IF HE IS TO TAKE ME WITH HIM IT MUST BE ON THE CONDITION THAT HE IS TO DO ALL THE FIGHTING
1495-138027-0036 AND THAT I AM NOT TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT CONCERNS KEEPING HIM CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE IN THIS I WILL DANCE ATTENDANCE ON HIM READILY BUT TO EXPECT ME TO DRAW SWORD EVEN AGAINST RASCALLY CHURLS
1495-138027-0037 OF THE HATCHET AND HOOD IS IDLE I DON'T SET UP TO BE A FIGHTING MAN SENOR SAMSON BUT ONLY THE BEST AND MOST LOYAL SQUIRE THAT EVER SERVED KNIGHT ERRANT
1495-138027-0038 IS PLEASED TO GIVE ME SOME ISLAND OF THE MANY HIS WORSHIP SAYS ONE MAY STUMBLE ON IN THESE PARTS I WILL TAKE IT AS A GREAT FAVOUR AND IF HE DOES NOT GIVE IT TO ME
1495-138027-0039 I WAS BORN LIKE EVERYONE ELSE AND A MAN MUST NOT LIVE IN DEPENDENCE ON ANYONE EXCEPT GOD AND WHAT IS MORE MY BREAD WILL TASTE AS WELL AND PERHAPS EVEN BETTER WITHOUT A GOVERNMENT THAN IF I WERE A GOVERNOR
1495-138027-0040 AND HOW DO I KNOW BUT THAT IN THESE GOVERNMENTS THE DEVIL MAY HAVE PREPARED SOME TRIP FOR ME TO MAKE ME LOSE MY FOOTING AND FALL AND KNOCK MY GRINDERS OUT SANCHO I WAS BORN AND SANCHO I MEAN TO DIE
1495-138027-0041 BUT FOR ALL THAT IF HEAVEN WERE TO MAKE ME A FAIR OFFER OF AN ISLAND OR SOMETHING ELSE OF THE KIND WITHOUT MUCH TROUBLE AND WITHOUT MUCH RISK I AM NOT SUCH A FOOL AS TO REFUSE IT FOR THEY SAY TOO
1495-138027-0042 WHEN THEY OFFER THEE A HEIFER RUN WITH A HALTER AND WHEN GOOD LUCK COMES TO THEE
1495-138027-0043 BUT FOR ALL THAT PUT YOUR TRUST IN GOD AND IN
1495-138027-0044 THE KINGDOM HE MIGHT GIVE ME INTO A SACK ALL IN HOLES FOR I HAVE FELT MY OWN PULSE AND I FIND MYSELF SOUND ENOUGH TO RULE KINGDOMS AND GOVERN ISLANDS
1495-138027-0045 AND I HAVE BEFORE NOW TOLD MY MASTER AS MUCH TAKE CARE SANCHO SAID SAMSON
1495-138027-0046 DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO AND TO SEE THAT A LETTER OF HER NAME WAS PLACED AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH LINE SO THAT AT THE END OF THE VERSES DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO
1495-138027-0047 MIGHT BE READ BY PUTTING TOGETHER THE FIRST LETTERS THE BACHELOR REPLIED THAT ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT ONE OF THE FAMOUS POETS OF SPAIN WHO WERE THEY SAID ONLY THREE AND A HALF HE WOULD NOT FAIL TO COMPOSE THE REQUIRED VERSES
1495-138027-0048 IF HE MADE FOUR BALLAD STANZAS OF FOUR LINES EACH THERE WOULD BE A LETTER OVER AND IF HE MADE THEM OF FIVE WHAT THEY CALLED DECIMAS OR
1495-138027-0049 THERE WERE THREE LETTERS SHORT NEVERTHELESS HE WOULD TRY TO DROP A LETTER AS WELL AS HE COULD SO THAT THE NAME DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO MIGHT BE GOT INTO FOUR BALLAD STANZAS IT MUST BE
1495-138027-0050 BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER SAID DON QUIXOTE FOR UNLESS THE NAME STANDS THERE PLAIN AND MANIFEST NO WOMAN WOULD BELIEVE THE VERSES WERE MADE FOR HER
1495-138027-0051 THEY AGREED UPON THIS AND THAT THE DEPARTURE SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN THREE DAYS FROM THAT TIME
1495-138027-0052 CHARGED THE BACHELOR TO KEEP IT A SECRET ESPECIALLY FROM THE CURATE AND MASTER NICHOLAS AND FROM HIS NIECE AND THE HOUSEKEEPER LEST THEY SHOULD PREVENT THE EXECUTION OF HIS PRAISEWORTHY AND VALIANT PURPOSE
1495-138027-0053 OF HIS GOOD OR EVIL FORTUNES WHENEVER HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY AND THUS THEY BADE EACH OTHER FAREWELL
1495-138027-0054 TO MAKE THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS FOR THEIR EXPEDITION CHAPTER FIVE OF THE SHREWD AND DROLL CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN
1495-138027-0055 AND HIS WIFE TERESA PANZA AND OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF BEING DULY RECORDED THE TRANSLATOR OF THIS HISTORY WHEN HE COMES TO WRITE THIS FIFTH CHAPTER SAYS THAT HE CONSIDERS IT APOCRYPHAL
1495-138027-0056 BECAUSE IN IT SANCHO PANZA SPEAKS IN A STYLE UNLIKE THAT WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM HIS LIMITED INTELLIGENCE AND SAYS THINGS SO SUBTLE
1495-138027-0057 HOWEVER DESIROUS OF DOING WHAT HIS TASK IMPOSED UPON HIM HE WAS UNWILLING TO LEAVE IT UNTRANSLATED AND THEREFORE HE WENT ON TO SAY
1495-138027-0058 THAT HIS WIFE NOTICED HIS HAPPINESS A BOWSHOT OFF SO MUCH SO THAT IT MADE HER ASK HIM WHAT HAVE YOU GOT SANCHO FRIEND THAT YOU ARE SO GLAD TO WHICH HE REPLIED WIFE IF IT WERE GOD'S WILL I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD
1495-138027-0059 NOT TO BE SO WELL PLEASED AS I SHOW MYSELF I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU HUSBAND SAID SHE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU WOULD BE GLAD IF IT WERE GOD'S WILL NOT TO BE WELL PLEASED FOR FOOL AS I AM
1495-138027-0060 HARK YE TERESA REPLIED SANCHO I AM GLAD BECAUSE I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO GO BACK TO THE SERVICE OF MY MASTER DON QUIXOTE WHO MEANS TO GO OUT A THIRD TIME TO SEEK FOR ADVENTURES
1495-138027-0061 AND I AM GOING WITH HIM AGAIN FOR MY NECESSITIES WILL HAVE IT SO AND ALSO THE HOPE THAT CHEERS ME WITH THE THOUGHT THAT I MAY FIND ANOTHER HUNDRED CROWNS LIKE THOSE WE HAVE SPENT
1495-138027-0062 AND IF GOD WOULD BE PLEASED TO LET ME HAVE MY DAILY BREAD DRY SHOD AND AT HOME WITHOUT TAKING ME OUT INTO THE BYWAYS AND CROSS ROADS AND HE COULD DO IT AT SMALL COST BY MERELY WILLING IT IT IS CLEAR MY HAPPINESS WOULD BE MORE SOLID AND LASTING
1495-138027-0063 SO THAT I WAS RIGHT IN SAYING I WOULD BE GLAD IF IT WERE GOD'S WILL NOT TO BE WELL PLEASED
1495-138027-0064 SAID TERESA EVER SINCE YOU JOINED ON TO A KNIGHT ERRANT YOU TALK IN SUCH A ROUNDABOUT WAY THAT THERE IS NO UNDERSTANDING YOU
1495-138027-0065 FOR HE IS THE UNDERSTANDER OF ALL THINGS THAT WILL DO BUT MIND SISTER YOU MUST LOOK TO DAPPLE CAREFULLY FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS SO THAT HE MAY BE FIT TO TAKE ARMS
1495-138027-0066 DOUBLE HIS FEED AND SEE TO THE PACK SADDLE AND OTHER HARNESS FOR IT IS NOT TO A WEDDING WE ARE BOUND BUT TO GO ROUND THE WORLD AND PLAY AT GIVE AND TAKE WITH GIANTS AND DRAGONS AND MONSTERS AND HEAR HISSINGS AND ROARINGS AND BELLOWINGS AND HOWLINGS
1495-138027-0067 AND EVEN ALL THIS WOULD BE LAVENDER
1495-138027-0068 WITH YANGUESANS AND ENCHANTED MOORS I KNOW WELL ENOUGH HUSBAND SAID TERESA THAT SQUIRES ERRANT DON'T EAT THEIR BREAD FOR NOTHING
1495-138027-0069 AND SO I WILL BE ALWAYS PRAYING TO OUR LORD TO DELIVER YOU SPEEDILY FROM ALL THAT HARD FORTUNE I CAN TELL YOU WIFE SAID SANCHO IF I DID NOT EXPECT TO SEE MYSELF GOVERNOR OF AN ISLAND BEFORE LONG I WOULD DROP DOWN DEAD ON THE SPOT
1495-138027-0070 NAY THEN HUSBAND SAID TERESA LET THE HEN LIVE THOUGH IT BE WITH HER PIP LIVE AND LET THE DEVIL TAKE ALL THE GOVERNMENTS IN THE WORLD YOU CAME OUT OF YOUR MOTHER'S WOMB WITHOUT A GOVERNMENT
1495-138027-0071 YOU HAVE LIVED UNTIL NOW WITHOUT A GOVERNMENT AND WHEN IT IS GOD'S WILL YOU WILL GO OR BE CARRIED TO YOUR GRAVE WITHOUT A GOVERNMENT HOW MANY THERE ARE IN THE WORLD WHO LIVE WITHOUT A GOVERNMENT
1495-138027-0072 AND CONTINUE TO LIVE ALL THE SAME AND ARE RECKONED IN THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE THE BEST SAUCE IN THE WORLD IS HUNGER AND AS THE POOR ARE NEVER WITHOUT THAT THEY ALWAYS EAT WITH A RELISH
1495-138027-0073 DON'T FORGET ME AND YOUR CHILDREN REMEMBER THAT SANCHICO IS NOW FULL FIFTEEN AND IT IS RIGHT HE SHOULD GO TO SCHOOL IF HIS UNCLE THE ABBOT HAS A MIND TO HAVE HIM TRAINED FOR THE CHURCH
1495-138027-0074 CONSIDER TOO THAT YOUR DAUGHTER
1495-138027-0075 WILL NOT DIE OF GRIEF IF WE MARRY HER FOR I HAVE MY SUSPICIONS THAT SHE IS AS EAGER TO GET A HUSBAND AS YOU TO GET A GOVERNMENT AND AFTER ALL A DAUGHTER LOOKS BETTER ILL MARRIED THAN WELL WHORED
1495-138027-0076 I INTEND WIFE TO MAKE SUCH A HIGH MATCH FOR MARI SANCHA THAT THERE WILL BE NO APPROACHING HER WITHOUT CALLING HER MY LADY NAY SANCHO RETURNED TERESA
1495-138027-0077 MARRY HER TO HER EQUAL THAT IS THE SAFEST PLAN FOR IF YOU PUT HER OUT OF WOODEN CLOGS INTO HIGH HEELED SHOES OUT OF HER GREY FLANNEL PETTICOAT INTO HOOPS AND SILK GOWNS OUT OF THE PLAIN
1495-138027-0078 MARICA AND THOU INTO DONA SO AND SO AND MY LADY THE GIRL WON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS AND AT EVERY TURN SHE WILL FALL INTO A THOUSAND BLUNDERS THAT WILL SHOW THE THREAD OF HER COARSE HOMESPUN STUFF
1495-138027-0079 IT WILL BE ONLY TO PRACTISE IT FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS AND THEN DIGNITY AND DECORUM WILL FIT HER AS EASILY AS A GLOVE AND IF NOT WHAT MATTER
1495-138027-0080 MY LADY AND NEVER MIND WHAT HAPPENS
1495-138027-0081 REPLIED TERESA DON'T TRY TO RAISE YOURSELF HIGHER AND BEAR IN MIND THE PROVERB THAT SAYS WIPE THE NOSE OF YOUR NEIGBBOUR'S SON AND TAKE HIM INTO YOUR HOUSE
1495-138027-0082 A FINE THING IT WOULD BE INDEED TO MARRY OUR MARIA TO SOME GREAT COUNT OR GRAND GENTLEMAN WHO WHEN THE HUMOUR TOOK HIM WOULD ABUSE HER AND CALL HER CLOWN BRED AND CLODHOPPER'S DAUGHTER AND SPINNING WENCH
1495-138027-0083 JUAN TOCHO'S SON A STOUT STURDY YOUNG FELLOW THAT WE KNOW AND I CAN SEE HE DOES NOT LOOK SOUR AT THE GIRL AND WITH HIM ONE OF OUR OWN SORT SHE WILL BE WELL MARRIED
1495-138027-0084 AND WE SHALL HAVE HER ALWAYS UNDER OUR EYES AND BE ALL ONE FAMILY PARENTS AND CHILDREN GRANDCHILDREN AND SONS IN LAW AND THE PEACE AND BLESSING OF GOD WILL DWELL AMONG US
1495-138027-0085 SO DON'T YOU GO MARRYING HER IN THOSE COURTS AND GRAND PALACES WHERE THEY WON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF HER OR SHE WHAT TO MAKE OF HERSELF WHY YOU IDIOT AND WIFE FOR BARABBAS SAID SANCHO
1495-138027-0086 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY TRYING WITHOUT WHY OR WHEREFORE TO KEEP ME FROM MARRYING MY DAUGHTER TO ONE WHO WILL GIVE ME GRANDCHILDREN THAT WILL BE CALLED YOUR LORDSHIP LOOK YE TERESA
1495-138027-0087 I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD MY ELDERS SAY THAT HE WHO DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LUCK WHEN IT COMES TO HIM HAS NO RIGHT TO COMPLAIN IF IT GIVES HIM THE GO BY AND NOW
1495-138027-0088 IT WILL NOT DO TO SHUT IT OUT LET US GO WITH THE FAVOURING BREEZE THAT BLOWS UPON US IT IS THIS SORT OF TALK AND WHAT SANCHO SAYS LOWER DOWN THAT MADE THE TRANSLATOR OF THE HISTORY SAY HE CONSIDERED THIS CHAPTER APOCRYPHAL
1495-138027-0089 LIFT US OUT OF THE MIRE AND MARRY MARI SANCHA TO WHOM I LIKE AND YOU YOURSELF WILL FIND YOURSELF CALLED DONA TERESA PANZA AND SITTING IN CHURCH ON A FINE CARPET AND CUSHIONS AND DRAPERIES
1495-138027-0090 IN SPITE AND IN DEFIANCE OF ALL THE BORN LADIES OF THE TOWN NO STAY AS YOU ARE GROWING NEITHER GREATER NOR LESS LIKE A TAPESTRY FIGURE LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT
1495-138027-0091 FOR SANCHICA SHALL BE A COUNTESS SAY WHAT YOU WILL
1495-138027-0092 REPLIED TERESA WELL FOR ALL THAT I AM AFRAID THIS RANK OF COUNTESS FOR MY DAUGHTER WILL BE HER RUIN YOU DO AS YOU LIKE MAKE A DUCHESS OR A PRINCESS OF HER BUT I CAN TELL YOU
1495-138027-0093 IT WILL NOT BE WITH MY WILL AND CONSENT I WAS ALWAYS A LOVER OF EQUALITY BROTHER AND I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE PEOPLE GIVE THEMSELVES AIRS WITHOUT ANY RIGHT THEY CALLED ME TERESA AT MY BAPTISM
1495-138027-0094 A PLAIN SIMPLE NAME WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONS OR TAGS OR FRINGES OF DONS OR DONAS CASCAJO WAS MY FATHER'S NAME AND AS I AM YOUR WIFE I AM CALLED TERESA PANZA
1495-138027-0095 BUT KINGS GO WHERE LAWS LIKE AND I AM CONTENT WITH THIS NAME WITHOUT HAVING THE DON PUT ON TOP OF IT TO MAKE IT SO HEAVY THAT I CANNOT CARRY IT
1495-138027-0096 AND I DON'T WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT ME WHEN THEY SEE ME GO DRESSED LIKE A COUNTESS OR GOVERNOR'S WIFE FOR THEY WILL SAY AT ONCE SEE WHAT AIRS THE SLUT GIVES HERSELF ONLY YESTERDAY SHE WAS ALWAYS SPINNING FLAX
1495-138027-0097 AND USED TO GO TO MASS WITH THE TAIL OF HER PETTICOAT OVER HER HEAD INSTEAD OF A MANTLE AND THERE SHE GOES TO DAY IN A HOOPED GOWN WITH HER BROACHES AND AIRS AS IF WE DIDN'T KNOW HER
1495-138027-0098 I AM NOT GOING TO BRING MYSELF TO SUCH A PASS GO YOU BROTHER AND BE A GOVERNMENT OR AN ISLAND MAN AND SWAGGER AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE FOR BY THE SOUL OF MY MOTHER NEITHER MY DAUGHTER NOR I ARE GOING TO STIR A STEP FROM OUR VILLAGE
1495-138027-0099 A RESPECTABLE WOMAN SHOULD HAVE A BROKEN LEG AND KEEP AT HOME AND TO BE BUSY AT SOMETHING IS A VIRTUOUS DAMSEL'S HOLIDAY
1495-138027-0100 FOR GOD WILL MEND THEM FOR US ACCORDING AS WE DESERVE IT I DON'T KNOW I'M SURE WHO FIXED THE DON TO HIM WHAT NEITHER HIS FATHER
1495-138027-0101 I DECLARE THOU HAST A DEVIL OF SOME SORT IN THY BODY
1495-138027-0102 GOD HELP THEE WHAT A LOT OF THINGS THOU HAST STRUNG TOGETHER
1495-138027-0103 LOOK HERE FOOL AND DOLT FOR SO I MAY CALL YOU WHEN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND MY WORDS AND RUN AWAY FROM GOOD FORTUNE IF I HAD SAID THAT MY DAUGHTER WAS TO THROW HERSELF DOWN FROM A TOWER OR GO ROAMING
1495-138027-0104 THE WORLD AS THE INFANTA DONA URRACA WANTED TO DO YOU WOULD BE RIGHT IN NOT GIVING WAY TO MY WILL BUT IF IN AN INSTANT IN LESS THAN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE I PUT THE DON
1495-138027-0105 AND MY LADY ON HER BACK AND TAKE HER OUT OF THE STUBBLE AND PLACE HER UNDER A CANOPY
1495-138027-0106 EVER HAD IN THEIR FAMILY WHY WON'T YOU CONSENT AND FALL IN WITH MY WISHES DO YOU KNOW WHY HUSBAND REPLIED TERESA BECAUSE OF THE PROVERB THAT SAYS WHO COVERS THEE DISCOVERS THEE
1495-138027-0107 AT THE POOR MAN PEOPLE ONLY THROW A HASTY GLANCE ON THE RICH MAN THEY FIX THEIR EYES AND IF THE SAID RICH MAN WAS ONCE ON A TIME POOR IT IS THEN THERE IS THE SNEERING
1495-138027-0108 AND THE TATTLE AND SPITE OF BACKBITERS AND IN THE STREETS HERE THEY SWARM AS THICK AS BEES LOOK HERE TERESA
1495-138027-0109 AND LISTEN TO WHAT I AM NOW GOING TO SAY TO YOU
1495-138027-0110 YOU NEVER HEARD IT IN ALL YOUR LIFE AND I DO NOT GIVE MY OWN NOTIONS FOR WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY ARE THE OPINIONS OF HIS REVERENCE THE PREACHER WHO PREACHED IN THIS TOWN LAST LENT AND WHO SAID IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY
1495-138027-0111 THAT ALL THINGS PRESENT THAT OUR EYES BEHOLD BRING THEMSELVES BEFORE US AND REMAIN AND FIX THEMSELVES ON OUR MEMORY MUCH BETTER AND MORE FORCIBLY THAN THINGS PAST
1495-138027-0112 THESE OBSERVATIONS WHICH SANCHO MAKES HERE ARE THE OTHER ONES ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH THE TRANSLATOR SAYS HE REGARDS THIS CHAPTER AS APOCRYPHAL INASMUCH AS THEY ARE BEYOND SANCHO'S CAPACITY
1495-138027-0113 WHENCE IT ARISES HE CONTINUED THAT WHEN WE SEE ANY PERSON WELL DRESSED AND MAKING A FIGURE WITH RICH GARMENTS AND RETINUE OF SERVANTS IT SEEMS TO LEAD AND IMPEL US PERFORCE TO RESPECT HIM
1495-138027-0114 IN WHICH WE HAVE SEEN HIM BUT WHICH WHETHER IT MAY HAVE BEEN POVERTY OR LOW BIRTH BEING NOW A THING OF THE PAST HAS NO EXISTENCE WHILE THE ONLY THING THAT HAS ANY EXISTENCE IS WHAT WE SEE BEFORE US
1495-138027-0115 AND IF THIS PERSON WHOM FORTUNE HAS RAISED FROM HIS ORIGINAL LOWLY STATE THESE WERE THE VERY WORDS THE PADRE USED TO HIS PRESENT HEIGHT OF PROSPERITY
1495-138027-0116 BE WELL BRED GENEROUS COURTEOUS TO ALL WITHOUT SEEKING TO VIE WITH THOSE WHOSE NOBILITY IS OF ANCIENT DATE DEPEND UPON IT TERESA NO ONE WILL REMEMBER WHAT HE WAS AND EVERYONE WILL RESPECT WHAT HE IS
1495-138027-0117 EXCEPT INDEED THE ENVIOUS FROM WHOM NO FAIR FORTUNE IS SAFE I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU HUSBAND REPLIED TERESA DO AS YOU LIKE AND DON'T BREAK MY HEAD WITH ANY MORE SPEECHIFYING AND RETHORIC
1495-138027-0118 AND IF YOU HAVE REVOLVED TO DO WHAT YOU SAY RESOLVED YOU SHOULD SAY WOMAN SAID SANCHO NOT REVOLVED DON'T SET YOURSELF TO WRANGLE WITH ME HUSBAND SAID TERESA I SPEAK AS GOD PLEASES AND DON'T DEAL
1495-138027-0119 IN OUT OF THE WAY PHRASES AND I SAY IF YOU ARE BENT UPON HAVING A GOVERNMENT TAKE YOUR SON SANCHO WITH YOU AND TEACH HIM FROM THIS TIME ON HOW TO HOLD A GOVERNMENT
1495-138027-0120 I WILL SEND FOR HIM BY POST AND I WILL SEND THEE MONEY OF WHICH I SHALL HAVE NO LACK FOR THERE IS NEVER ANY WANT OF PEOPLE TO LEND IT TO GOVERNORS WHEN THEY HAVE NOT GOT IT AND DO THOU DRESS HIM SO AS TO HIDE WHAT HE IS
1495-138027-0121 AND MAKE HIM LOOK WHAT HE IS TO BE YOU SEND THE MONEY SAID TERESA AND I'LL DRESS HIM UP FOR YOU AS FINE AS YOU PLEASE
1495-138027-0122 REPLIED TERESA IT WILL BE THE SAME TO ME AS IF I WAS BURYING HER BUT ONCE MORE I SAY DO AS YOU PLEASE FOR WE WOMEN ARE BORN TO THIS BURDEN OF BEING OBEDIENT TO OUR HUSBANDS THOUGH THEY BE DOGS
