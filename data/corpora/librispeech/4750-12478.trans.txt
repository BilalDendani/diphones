4750-12478-0000 WITHOUT HIS APPROBATION THEY ACCUSED HIM AND SUSPECTED THAT HE MADE IT HIS BUSINESS TO KEEP IN A DISTRESSED CONDITION THAT THEY MIGHT ALWAYS STAND IN NEED OF HIS ASSISTANCE ACCORDINGLY THEY RESOLVED TO FIGHT WITH THE CANAANITES
4750-12478-0001 AND SAID THAT GOD GAVE THEM HIS ASSISTANCE NOT OUT OF REGARD TO MOSES'S INTERCESSIONS BUT BECAUSE HE TOOK CARE OF THEIR ENTIRE NATION ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR FOREFATHERS WHOSE AFFAIRS HE TOOK UNDER HIS OWN CONDUCT AS ALSO
4750-12478-0002 AND WOULD BE ASSISTING TO THEM NOW THEY WERE WILLING TO TAKE PAINS FOR IT THEY ALSO SAID THAT THEY WERE POSSESSED OF ABILITIES SUFFICIENT FOR THE CONQUEST OF THEIR ENEMIES ALTHOUGH MOSES SHOULD HAVE A MIND TO ALIENATE GOD FROM THEM
4750-12478-0003 AND NOT SO FAR TO REJOICE IN THEIR DELIVERANCE FROM THE INDIGNITIES THEY ENDURED UNDER THE EGYPTIANS AS TO BEAR THE TYRANNY OF MOSES OVER THEM AND TO SUFFER THEMSELVES TO BE DELUDED AND LIVE ACCORDING TO HIS PLEASURE AS THOUGH GOD DID ONLY FORETELL WHAT CONCERNS US
4750-12478-0004 AS IF THEY WERE NOT ALL THE POSTERITY OF ABRAHAM THAT GOD MADE HIM ALONE THE AUTHOR OF ALL THE KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE AND WE MUST STILL LEARN IT FROM HIM
4750-12478-0005 THAT IT WOULD BE A PIECE OF PRUDENCE TO OPPOSE HIS ARROGANT PRETENSES AND TO PUT THEIR CONFIDENCE IN GOD AND TO RESOLVE TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THAT LAND WHICH HE HAD PROMISED THEM
4750-12478-0006 THEY WENT AGAINST THEIR ENEMIES BUT THOSE ENEMIES WERE NOT DISMAYED EITHER AT THE ATTACK ITSELF OR AT THE GREAT MULTITUDE THAT MADE IT AND RECEIVED THEM WITH GREAT COURAGE MANY OF THE HEBREWS WERE SLAIN AND THE REMAINDER OF THE ARMY UPON THE DISORDER OF THEIR TROOPS WERE PURSUED AND FLED
4750-12478-0007 MADE THEM QUITE DESPOND AND THEY HOPED FOR NOTHING THAT WAS GOOD AS GATHERING FROM IT THAT THIS AFFLICTION CAME FROM THE WRATH OF GOD
4750-12478-0008 FOR THEY WERE SENSIBLE THAT WITHOUT HIS CARE FOR THEM THEIR AFFAIRS COULD NOT BE IN A GOOD CONDITION AND HE CAUSED THE HOST TO REMOVE AND HE WENT FURTHER INTO THE WILDERNESS AS INTENDING THERE TO LET THEM REST
4750-12478-0009 CHAPTER TWO THE SEDITION OF CORAH AND OF THE MULTITUDE AGAINST MOSES AND AGAINST HIS BROTHER
4750-12478-0010 AND ESPECIALLY UPON ILL SUCCESS TO BE HARD TO BE PLEASED AND GOVERNED WITH DIFFICULTY DID NOW BEFALL THE JEWS FOR THEY BEING IN NUMBER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND AND BY REASON OF THEIR GREAT MULTITUDE
4750-12478-0011 NOT READILY SUBJECT TO THEIR GOVERNORS EVEN IN PROSPERITY THEY AT THIS TIME WERE MORE THAN USUALLY ANGRY BOTH AGAINST ONE ANOTHER AND AGAINST THEIR LEADER BECAUSE OF THE DISTRESS THEY WERE IN
4750-12478-0012 BY WHICH THEY WERE IN DANGER OF BEING ALL DESTROYED BUT WERE NOTWITHSTANDING SAVED BY MOSES
4750-12478-0013 HE DELIVERED THEM FROM THOSE TERRIBLE CALAMITIES WHICH WITHOUT HIS PROVIDENTIAL CARE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UPON THEM BY THIS SEDITION SO I WILL FIRST EXPLAIN THE CAUSE WHENCE THIS SEDITION AROSE
4750-12478-0014 AND THEN WILL GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE SEDITION ITSELF
4750-12478-0015 AND WAS AT IT AND ENVIED HIM ON THAT ACCOUNT HE OF THE SAME TRIBE WITH MOSES AND OF KIN TO HIM WAS PARTICULARLY GRIEVED BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE BETTER DESERVED THAT HONORABLE POST ON ACCOUNT OF GREAT RICHES
4750-12478-0016 AND PAVED THE WAY TO GLORY FOR HIMSELF AND BY ILL ARTS SHOULD OBTAIN IT UNDER THE PRETENSE OF GOD'S COMMAND WHILE CONTRARY TO LAWS HE HAD GIVEN THE PRIESTHOOD TO AARON
4750-12478-0017 HE ADDED THAT THIS CONCEALED WAY OF IMPOSING ON THEM WAS HARDER TO BE BORNE THAN IF IT HAD BEEN DONE BY AN OPEN FORCE UPON THEM
4750-12478-0018 EVEN WHILE THEY THINK THEMSELVES CONCEALED IN THEIR DESIGNS AND NOT SUFFER THEM TO GAIN STRENGTH TILL THEY HAVE THEM FOR THEIR OPEN ENEMIES FOR WHAT ACCOUNT ADDED HE IS MOSES ABLE TO GIVE
4750-12478-0019 WHY HE HAS BESTOWED THE PRIESTHOOD ON AARON AND HIS SONS FOR
4750-12478-0020 THAT OF REUBEN MIGHT HAVE IT MOST JUSTLY
4750-12478-0021 AND ABIRAM AND ON THE SON OF PELETH WOULD HAVE IT
4750-12478-0022 HAD A MIND TO APPEAR TO TAKE CARE OF THE PUBLIC WELFARE BUT IN REALITY HE WAS ENDEAVORING TO PROCURE TO HAVE THAT DIGNITY TRANSFERRED BY THE MULTITUDE TO HIMSELF THUS DID HE OUT OF A MALIGNANT DESIGN
4750-12478-0023 WHEN THESE WORDS DID GRADUALLY SPREAD TO MORE PEOPLE AND WHEN THE HEARERS STILL ADDED TO WHAT TENDED TO THE SCANDALS THAT WERE CAST UPON AARON THE WHOLE ARMY WAS FULL OF THEM NOW OF THOSE THAT CONSPIRED WITH CORAH
4750-12478-0024 THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THOSE OF THE PRINCIPAL MEN ALSO WHO WERE EAGER TO HAVE THE PRIESTHOOD TAKEN AWAY FROM MOSES'S BROTHER AND TO BRING HIM INTO DISGRACE NAY THE MULTITUDE THEMSELVES WERE PROVOKED TO BE SEDITIOUS
4750-12478-0025 AND ATTEMPTED TO STONE MOSES AND GATHERED THEMSELVES TOGETHER AFTER AN INDECENT MANNER WITH CONFUSION AND DISORDER AND NOW ALL WERE IN A TUMULTUOUS MANNER RAISING A CLAMOUR BEFORE THE TABERNACLE OF GOD
4750-12478-0026 TO PROSECUTE THE TYRANT AND TO RELIEVE THE MULTITUDE FROM THEIR SLAVERY UNDER HIM WHO UNDER COLOR OF THE DIVINE LAID VIOLENT INJUNCTIONS UPON THEM
4750-12478-0027 HE WOULD HAVE RAISED PERSON TO THAT DIGNITY AND WOULD NOT PRODUCED SUCH A ONE AS WAS INFERIOR TO MANY OTHERS NOR HAVE GIVEN HIM THAT OFFICE
4750-12478-0028 HE WOULD HAVE PERMITTED IT TO THE MULTITUDE TO BESTOW IT
4750-12478-0029 AND KNOWING THAT HIS BROTHER HAD BEEN MADE PARTAKER OF THE PRIESTHOOD AT THE COMMAND OF GOD AND NOT BY HIS OWN FAVOR TO HIM HE CAME TO THE ASSEMBLY AND AS FOR THE MULTITUDE HE SAID NOT A WORD TO THEM
4750-12478-0030 BUT SPAKE AS LOUD TO CORAH AS HE COULD AND BEING VERY SKILLFUL IN MAKING SPEECHES AND HAVING THIS NATURAL TALENT AMONG OTHERS THAT HE COULD GREATLY MOVE THE MULTITUDE WITH HIS DISCOURSES HE SAID O CORAH
4750-12478-0031 BOTH THOU AND ALL THESE WITH THEE POINTING TO THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN SEEM TO BE WORTHY OF THIS HONOR
4750-12478-0032 ALTHOUGH THEY MAY NOT BE SO RICH OR SO GREAT AS YOU ARE NOR HAVE I TAKEN AND GIVEN THIS OFFICE TO MY BROTHER BECAUSE HE EXCELLED OTHERS IN RICHES
4750-12478-0033 HAS MADE OUR FAMILIES EQUAL NAY NOR WAS IT OUT OF BROTHERLY AFFECTION WHICH ANOTHER MIGHT YET HAVE JUSTLY DONE FOR CERTAINLY UNLESS I HAD BESTOWED THIS HONOR OUT OF REGARD TO GOD AND TO HIS LAWS
4750-12478-0034 I HAD NOT PASSED BY MYSELF AND GIVEN IT TO ANOTHER AS BEING NEARER OF KIN TO MYSELF THAN TO MY BROTHER AND HAVING A CLOSER INTIMACY WITH MYSELF THAN I HAVE WITH HIM FOR SURELY
4750-12478-0035 NOR WOULD GOD HAVE OVERLOOKED THIS MATTER AND SEEN HIMSELF THUS DESPISED NOR WOULD HE HAVE SUFFERED YOU TO BE IGNORANT OF WHAT YOU WERE TO DO IN ORDER TO PLEASE HIM
4750-12478-0036 AND THEREBY FREED US FROM THAT CARE SO THAT IT WAS NOT A THING THAT I PRETEND TO GIVE BUT ONLY ACCORDING TO THE DETERMINATION OF GOD I THEREFORE PROPOSE IT STILL TO BE CONTENDED FOR
4750-12478-0037 BY SUCH AS PLEASE TO PUT IN FOR IT ONLY DESIRING THAT HE WHO HAS BEEN ALREADY PREFERRED AND HAS ALREADY OBTAINED IT MAY BE ALLOWED NOW ALSO TO OFFER HIMSELF FOR A CANDIDATE
4750-12478-0038 HE PREFERS YOUR PEACE AND YOUR LIVING WITHOUT SEDITION TO THIS HONORABLE EMPLOYMENT ALTHOUGH IN TRUTH IT WAS WITH YOUR APPROBATION THAT HE OBTAINED IT FOR THOUGH GOD WERE THE DONOR
4750-12478-0039 YET DO WE NOT OFFEND WHEN WE THINK FIT TO ACCEPT IT WITH YOUR GOOD WILL YET WOULD IT HAVE BEEN AN INSTANCE OF IMPIETY NOT TO HAVE TAKEN THAT HONORABLE EMPLOYMENT WHEN HE OFFERED IT NAY IT HAD BEEN EXCEEDINGLY UNREASONABLE
4750-12478-0040 ANY ONE SHOULD HAVE IT FOR ALL TIME TO COME AND HAD MADE IT SECURE AND FIRM TO HIM TO HAVE REFUSED IT HOWEVER HE HIMSELF WILL JUDGE AGAIN WHO IT SHALL BE WHOM HE WOULD HAVE TO OFFER SACRIFICES TO HIM
4750-12478-0041 AND TO HAVE THE DIRECTION OF MATTERS OF RELIGION FOR IT IS ABSURD THAT CORAH WHO IS AMBITIOUS OF THIS HONOR SHOULD DEPRIVE GOD OF THE POWER OF GIVING IT TO WHOM HE PLEASES
4750-12478-0042 PUT AN END THEREFORE TO YOUR SEDITION AND DISTURBANCE ON THIS ACCOUNT AND TOMORROW MORNING DO EVERY ONE OF YOU THAT DESIRE THE PRIESTHOOD BRING A CENSER FROM HOME AND COME HITHER WITH INCENSE AND FIRE
4750-12478-0043 DO THOU ALSO COME THAT THIS CONTEST ABOUT THIS HONORABLE EMPLOYMENT
4750-12478-0044 WITHOUT OFFENSE TO OFFER HIMSELF TO THIS SCRUTINY SINCE HE IS OF THE SAME LINEAGE WITH THYSELF AND HAS DONE NOTHING IN HIS PRIESTHOOD THAT CAN BE LIABLE TO EXCEPTION COME YE THEREFORE TOGETHER
4750-12478-0045 AND OFFER YOUR INCENSE IN PUBLIC BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE AND WHEN YOU OFFER IT HE WHOSE SACRIFICE GOD SHALL ACCEPT SHALL BE ORDAINED TO THE PRIESTHOOD
