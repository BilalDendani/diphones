62-121084-0000 CHAPTER SIXTY SIX MATRIMONIAL PROJECTS THE DAY FOLLOWING THIS SCENE
62-121084-0001 AT THIS TIME THAT IS ABOUT HALF PAST TWELVE
62-121084-0002 WATCHED THE DEPARTURE HE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR
62-121084-0003 BUT AT TWO O'CLOCK SHE HAD NOT RETURNED HE THEN CALLED FOR HIS HORSES DROVE TO THE CHAMBER AND INSCRIBED HIS NAME TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BUDGET FROM TWELVE TO TWO O'CLOCK
62-121084-0004 HEAPING FIGURE UPON FIGURE AND RECEIVING AMONG OTHER VISITS ONE FROM MAJOR CAVALCANTI WHO AS STIFF AND EXACT AS EVER PRESENTED HIMSELF PRECISELY AT THE HOUR NAMED THE NIGHT BEFORE TO TERMINATE HIS BUSINESS WITH THE BANKER ON LEAVING THE CHAMBER
62-121084-0005 AND BEEN MORE BITTER THAN EVER AGAINST THE MINISTRY RE ENTERED HIS CARRIAGE
62-121084-0006 MONTE CRISTO WAS AT HOME ONLY HE WAS ENGAGED WITH SOME ONE
62-121084-0007 WHILE THE BANKER WAS WAITING IN THE ANTEROOM THE DOOR OPENED AND A MAN DRESSED AS AN ABBE AND DOUBTLESS MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE HOUSE THAN HE WAS CAME IN AND INSTEAD OF WAITING MERELY BOWED PASSED ON TO THE FARTHER APARTMENTS
62-121084-0008 AND DISAPPEARED A MINUTE AFTER THE DOOR BY WHICH THE PRIEST HAD ENTERED REOPENED AND MONTE CRISTO APPEARED
62-121084-0009 WHOM YOU PERHAPS SAW PASS BY HAS JUST ARRIVED IN PARIS NOT HAVING SEEN HIM FOR A LONG TIME I COULD NOT MAKE UP MY MIND TO LEAVE HIM SOONER SO I HOPE THIS WILL BE SUFFICIENT REASON FOR MY HAVING MADE YOU WAIT
62-121084-0010 NOT AT ALL ON THE CONTRARY BE SEATED BUT WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU YOU LOOK CAREWORN REALLY YOU ALARM ME
62-121084-0011 PRESAGES SOME MISFORTUNE TO THE WORLD
62-121084-0012 AND I HAVE HEARD NOTHING BUT BAD NEWS AH INDEED SAID MONTE CRISTO HAVE YOU HAD ANOTHER FALL AT THE BOURSE
62-121084-0013 REALLY DOES IT HAPPEN TO BE JACOPO MANFREDI EXACTLY SO
62-121084-0014 IMAGINE A MAN WHO HAS TRANSACTED BUSINESS WITH ME FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG TO THE AMOUNT OF EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND OR NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS DURING THE YEAR NEVER A MISTAKE OR DELAY
62-121084-0015 WELL I WAS A MILLION IN ADVANCE WITH HIM AND NOW MY FINE JACOPO MANFREDI SUSPENDS PAYMENT REALLY IT IS AN UNHEARD OF FATALITY
62-121084-0016 I HOLD BILLS OF EXCHANGE SIGNED BY HIM TO THE VALUE OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS PAYABLE AT HIS CORRESPONDENT'S IN PARIS AT THE END OF THIS MONTH TO DAY IS THE THIRTIETH I PRESENT THEM BUT MY CORRESPONDENT HAS DISAPPEARED
62-121084-0017 THIS WITH MY SPANISH AFFAIRS MADE A PRETTY END TO THE MONTH THEN YOU REALLY LOST BY THAT AFFAIR IN SPAIN YES ONLY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS OUT OF MY CASH BOX NOTHING MORE
62-121084-0018 WHY HOW COULD YOU MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE SUCH AN OLD STAGER
62-121084-0019 SHE DREAMED DON CARLOS HAD RETURNED TO SPAIN SHE BELIEVES IN DREAMS IT IS MAGNETISM SHE SAYS AND WHEN SHE DREAMS A THING IT IS SURE TO HAPPEN SHE ASSURES ME ON THIS CONVICTION I ALLOW HER TO SPECULATE
62-121084-0020 SHE SPECULATED AND LOST IT IS TRUE SHE SPECULATES WITH HER OWN MONEY NOT MINE NEVERTHELESS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS LEAVE THE WIFE'S POCKET THE HUSBAND ALWAYS FINDS IT OUT
62-121084-0021 BUT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVE NOT HEARD OF THIS
62-121084-0022 THEN YOU DO NOT SPECULATE I HOW COULD I SPECULATE WHEN I ALREADY HAVE SO MUCH TROUBLE IN REGULATING MY INCOME I SHOULD BE OBLIGED BESIDES MY STEWARD TO KEEP A CLERK AND A BOY
62-121084-0023 BUT TOUCHING THESE SPANISH AFFAIRS I THINK THAT THE BARONESS DID NOT DREAM THE WHOLE OF THE DON CARLOS MATTER THE PAPERS SAID SOMETHING ABOUT IT DID THEY NOT THEN YOU BELIEVE THE PAPERS I
62-121084-0024 NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD ONLY I FANCIED THAT THE HONEST MESSAGER WAS AN EXCEPTION TO THE RULE AND THAT IT ONLY ANNOUNCED TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCHES WELL
62-121084-0025 WAS BROUGHT BY TELEGRAPH SO THAT SAID MONTE CRISTO YOU HAVE LOST NEARLY ONE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS THIS MONTH NOT NEARLY INDEED THAT IS EXACTLY MY LOSS
62-121084-0026 IT IS A HARD BLOW FOR A THIRD RATE FORTUNE
62-121084-0027 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT CERTAINLY CONTINUED MONTE CRISTO I MAKE THREE ASSORTMENTS IN FORTUNE FIRST RATE SECOND RATE AND THIRD RATE FORTUNES
62-121084-0028 I CALL THOSE FIRST RATE WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF TREASURES ONE POSSESSES UNDER ONE'S HAND SUCH AS MINES LANDS AND FUNDED PROPERTY IN SUCH STATES AS FRANCE AUSTRIA AND ENGLAND PROVIDED THESE TREASURES AND PROPERTY
62-121084-0029 FORM A TOTAL OF ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLIONS I CALL THOSE SECOND RATE FORTUNES THAT ARE GAINED BY MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISES JOINT STOCK COMPANIES VICEROYALTIES AND PRINCIPALITIES
62-121084-0030 NOT DRAWING MORE THAN ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS THE WHOLE FORMING A CAPITAL OF ABOUT FIFTY MILLIONS FINALLY I CALL THOSE THIRD RATE FORTUNES WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF A FLUCTUATING CAPITAL
62-121084-0031 DEPENDENT UPON THE WILL OF OTHERS OR UPON CHANCES WHICH A BANKRUPTCY INVOLVES OR A FALSE TELEGRAM SHAKES SUCH AS BANKS SPECULATIONS OF THE DAY IN FACT ALL OPERATIONS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GREATER OR LESS MISCHANCES
62-121084-0032 THE WHOLE BRINGING IN A REAL OR FICTITIOUS CAPITAL OF ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLIONS I THINK THIS IS ABOUT YOUR POSITION IS IT NOT CONFOUND IT YES REPLIED DANGLARS
62-121084-0033 THE RESULT THEN OF SIX MORE SUCH MONTHS AS THIS WOULD BE TO REDUCE THE THIRD RATE HOUSE TO DESPAIR OH SAID DANGLARS BECOMING VERY PALE
62-121084-0034 SEVEN SUCH MONTHS CONTINUED MONTE CRISTO IN THE SAME TONE TELL ME HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SEVEN TIMES
62-121084-0035 MAKE NEARLY TWELVE MILLIONS NO YOU HAVE NOT WELL YOU ARE RIGHT FOR IF YOU INDULGED IN SUCH REFLECTIONS YOU WOULD NEVER RISK YOUR PRINCIPAL WHICH IS TO THE SPECULATOR WHAT THE SKIN IS TO CIVILIZED MAN
62-121084-0036 WE HAVE OUR CLOTHES SOME MORE SPLENDID THAN OTHERS THIS IS OUR CREDIT BUT WHEN A MAN DIES HE HAS ONLY HIS SKIN IN THE SAME WAY ON RETIRING FROM BUSINESS
62-121084-0037 YOU HAVE NOTHING BUT YOUR REAL PRINCIPAL OF ABOUT FIVE OR SIX MILLIONS AT THE MOST FOR THIRD RATE FORTUNES ARE NEVER MORE THAN A FOURTH OF WHAT THEY APPEAR TO BE
62-121084-0038 YOU HAVE JUST LOST NEARLY TWO MILLIONS WHICH MUST OF COURSE IN THE SAME DEGREE DIMINISH YOUR CREDIT AND FICTITIOUS FORTUNE TO FOLLOW OUT MY SIMILE YOUR SKIN HAS BEEN OPENED BY BLEEDING AND THIS IF REPEATED
62-121084-0039 DO YOU WANT MONEY DO YOU WISH ME TO LEND YOU SOME
62-121084-0040 EXCLAIMED DANGLARS CALLING TO HIS ASSISTANCE ALL HIS PHILOSOPHY AND DISSIMULATION I HAVE MADE MONEY AT THE SAME TIME BY SPECULATIONS WHICH HAVE SUCCEEDED I HAVE MADE UP THE LOSS OF BLOOD BY NUTRITION I LOST A BATTLE IN SPAIN
62-121084-0041 I HAVE BEEN DEFEATED IN TRIESTE BUT MY NAVAL ARMY IN INDIA WILL HAVE TAKEN SOME GALLEONS AND MY MEXICAN PIONEERS WILL HAVE DISCOVERED SOME MINE VERY GOOD VERY GOOD
62-121084-0042 BUT THE WOUND REMAINS AND WILL REOPEN AT THE FIRST LOSS NO FOR I AM ONLY EMBARKED IN CERTAINTIES
62-121084-0043 WITH THE AIR OF A MOUNTEBANK SOUNDING HIS OWN PRAISES TO INVOLVE ME THREE GOVERNMENTS MUST CRUMBLE TO DUST WELL SUCH THINGS HAVE BEEN THAT THERE SHOULD BE A FAMINE RECOLLECT THE SEVEN FAT AND THE SEVEN LEAN KINE
62-121084-0044 AND EVEN THEN MY VESSELS WOULD BECOME CARAVANS SO MUCH THE BETTER
62-121084-0045 I SEE I WAS DECEIVED AND THAT YOU BELONG TO THE CLASS OF SECOND RATE FORTUNES I THINK I MAY ASPIRE TO THAT HONOR
62-121084-0046 WHICH REMINDED MONTE CRISTO OF THE SICKLY MOONS WHICH BAD ARTISTS ARE SO FOND OF DAUBING INTO THEIR PICTURES OF RUINS BUT WHILE WE ARE SPEAKING OF BUSINESS DANGLARS ADDED
62-121084-0047 PLEASED TO FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF CHANGING THE SUBJECT TELL ME
62-121084-0048 GIVE HIM MONEY IF HE IS RECOMMENDED TO YOU AND THE RECOMMENDATION SEEMS GOOD EXCELLENT HE PRESENTED HIMSELF THIS MORNING WITH A BOND OF FORTY THOUSAND FRANCS PAYABLE AT SIGHT ON YOU SIGNED BY BUSONI
62-121084-0049 AND RETURNED BY YOU TO ME WITH YOUR INDORSEMENT OF COURSE I IMMEDIATELY COUNTED HIM OVER THE FORTY BANK NOTES MONTE CRISTO NODDED HIS HEAD IN TOKEN OF ASSENT BUT THAT IS NOT ALL CONTINUED DANGLARS
62-121084-0050 HE HAS OPENED AN ACCOUNT WITH MY HOUSE FOR HIS SON MAY I ASK HOW MUCH HE ALLOWS THE YOUNG MAN FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS PER MONTH SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS PER YEAR
62-121084-0051 HOW CAN A YOUNG MAN LIVE UPON FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS A MONTH BUT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF THE YOUNG MAN SHOULD WANT A FEW THOUSANDS MORE DO NOT ADVANCE IT THE FATHER WILL NEVER REPAY IT
62-121084-0052 YOU DO NOT KNOW THESE ULTRAMONTANE MILLIONAIRES THEY ARE REGULAR MISERS AND BY WHOM WERE THEY RECOMMENDED TO YOU OH BY THE HOUSE OF FENZI ONE OF THE BEST IN FLORENCE
62-121084-0053 I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY YOU WILL LOSE BUT NEVERTHELESS MIND YOU HOLD TO THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT WOULD YOU NOT TRUST THE CAVALCANTI I OH I WOULD ADVANCE SIX MILLIONS ON HIS SIGNATURE
62-121084-0054 I WAS ONLY SPEAKING IN REFERENCE TO THE SECOND RATE FORTUNES WE WERE MENTIONING JUST NOW AND WITH ALL THIS HOW UNASSUMING HE IS
62-121084-0055 AND YOU WOULD HAVE FLATTERED HIM FOR CERTAINLY AS YOU SAY HE HAS NO MANNER THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM HE APPEARED TO ME LIKE AN OLD LIEUTENANT WHO HAD GROWN MOULDY UNDER HIS EPAULETS
62-121084-0056 BUT ALL THE ITALIANS ARE THE SAME THEY ARE LIKE OLD JEWS WHEN THEY ARE NOT GLITTERING IN ORIENTAL SPLENDOR THE YOUNG MAN IS BETTER
62-121084-0057 HE APPEARED TOLERABLE I WAS UNEASY ABOUT HIM WHY BECAUSE YOU MET HIM AT MY HOUSE JUST AFTER HIS INTRODUCTION INTO THE WORLD AS THEY TOLD ME
62-121084-0058 HE HAS BEEN TRAVELLING WITH A VERY SEVERE TUTOR AND HAD NEVER BEEN TO PARIS BEFORE AH I BELIEVE NOBLEMEN MARRY AMONGST THEMSELVES DO THEY NOT
62-121084-0059 THEY LIKE TO UNITE THEIR FORTUNES IT IS USUAL CERTAINLY BUT CAVALCANTI IS AN ORIGINAL WHO DOES NOTHING LIKE OTHER PEOPLE
62-121084-0060 DO YOU THINK SO I AM SURE OF IT AND YOU HAVE HEARD HIS FORTUNE MENTIONED NOTHING ELSE WAS TALKED OF ONLY SOME SAID HE WAS WORTH MILLIONS AND OTHERS THAT HE DID NOT POSSESS A FARTHING
62-121084-0061 AND WHAT IS YOUR OPINION I OUGHT NOT TO INFLUENCE YOU BECAUSE IT IS ONLY MY OWN PERSONAL IMPRESSION WELL AND IT IS THAT
62-121084-0062 THAT ALL THESE OLD PODESTAS THESE ANCIENT CONDOTTIERI FOR THE CAVALCANTI HAVE COMMANDED ARMIES AND GOVERNED PROVINCES MY OPINION I SAY IS THAT THEY HAVE BURIED THEIR MILLIONS IN CORNERS
62-121084-0063 THE SECRET OF WHICH THEY HAVE TRANSMITTED ONLY TO THEIR ELDEST SONS WHO HAVE DONE THE SAME FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION AND THE PROOF OF THIS IS SEEN IN THEIR YELLOW AND DRY APPEARANCE LIKE THE FLORINS OF THE REPUBLIC WHICH FROM BEING CONSTANTLY GAZED UPON
62-121084-0064 HAVE BECOME REFLECTED IN THEM CERTAINLY SAID DANGLARS AND THIS IS FURTHER SUPPORTED BY THE FACT OF THEIR NOT POSSESSING AN INCH OF LAND VERY LITTLE AT LEAST I KNOW OF NONE WHICH CAVALCANTI POSSESSES
62-121084-0065 EXCEPTING HIS PALACE IN LUCCA AH HE HAS A PALACE
62-121084-0066 COME THAT IS SOMETHING YES AND MORE THAN THAT HE LETS IT TO THE MINISTER OF FINANCE WHILE HE LIVES IN A SIMPLE HOUSE OH AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE I THINK THE OLD FELLOW IS VERY CLOSE
62-121084-0067 COME YOU DO NOT FLATTER HIM I SCARCELY KNOW HIM I THINK I HAVE SEEN HIM THREE TIMES IN MY LIFE ALL I KNOW RELATING TO HIM IS THROUGH BUSONI AND HIMSELF
62-121084-0068 HE WAS TELLING ME THIS MORNING THAT TIRED OF LETTING HIS PROPERTY LIE DORMANT IN ITALY WHICH IS A DEAD NATION HE WISHED TO FIND A METHOD EITHER IN FRANCE OR ENGLAND OF MULTIPLYING HIS MILLIONS
62-121084-0069 BUT REMEMBER THAT THOUGH I PLACE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN BUSONI I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS NEVER MIND ACCEPT MY THANKS FOR THE CLIENT YOU HAVE SENT ME IT IS A FINE NAME TO INSCRIBE ON MY LEDGERS
62-121084-0070 AND MY CASHIER WAS QUITE PROUD OF IT WHEN I EXPLAINED TO HIM WHO THE CAVALCANTI WERE BY THE WAY THIS IS MERELY A SIMPLE QUESTION WHEN THIS SORT OF PEOPLE MARRY THEIR SONS DO THEY GIVE THEM ANY FORTUNE
62-121084-0071 THAT DEPENDS UPON CIRCUMSTANCES
62-121084-0072 ONE OF THE NOBLEST FAMILIES IN TUSCANY WHO WHEN HIS SONS MARRIED ACCORDING TO HIS WISH GAVE THEM MILLIONS AND WHEN THEY MARRIED AGAINST HIS CONSENT MERELY ALLOWED THEM THIRTY CROWNS A MONTH SHOULD ANDREA
62-121084-0073 HE WILL PERHAPS GIVE HIM ONE TWO OR THREE MILLIONS FOR EXAMPLE SUPPOSING IT WERE THE DAUGHTER OF A BANKER HE MIGHT TAKE AN INTEREST IN THE HOUSE OF THE FATHER IN LAW OF HIS SON THEN AGAIN IF HE DISLIKED HIS CHOICE
62-121084-0074 DOUBLE LOCKS HIS COFFER AND MASTER ANDREA WOULD BE OBLIGED TO LIVE LIKE THE SONS OF A PARISIAN FAMILY BY SHUFFLING CARDS OR RATTLING THE DICE AH THAT BOY WILL FIND OUT SOME BAVARIAN OR PERUVIAN PRINCESS
62-121084-0075 HE WILL WANT A CROWN AND AN IMMENSE FORTUNE NO THESE GRAND LORDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ALPS FREQUENTLY MARRY INTO PLAIN FAMILIES LIKE JUPITER THEY LIKE TO CROSS THE RACE
62-121084-0076 AND YOU KNOW I AM A SPECULATOR
62-121084-0077 AH WELL HE WOULD CARE VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT I THINK BUT HE IS BETROTHED TO YOUR DAUGHTER I BELIEVE WELL
62-121084-0078 BUT MADAME DE MORCERF AND ALBERT YOU DO NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT IT WOULD NOT BE A GOOD MATCH
62-121084-0079 BUT TELL ME WHAT
62-121084-0080 SAID DANGLARS LAUGHING IT WOULD DO HER A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD WHY SO
62-121084-0081 MONTE CRISTO TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS ILL NATURED REMARK BUT STILL
62-121084-0082 SAID THE COUNT YOU MUST ALLOW THAT HE HAS A FINE NAME
62-121084-0083 CERTAINLY YOUR NAME IS POPULAR AND DOES HONOR TO THE TITLE THEY HAVE ADORNED IT WITH BUT YOU ARE TOO INTELLIGENT NOT TO KNOW THAT ACCORDING TO A PREJUDICE TOO FIRMLY ROOTED TO BE EXTERMINATED
62-121084-0084 A NOBILITY WHICH DATES BACK FIVE CENTURIES IS WORTH MORE THAN ONE THAT CAN ONLY RECKON TWENTY YEARS AND FOR THIS VERY REASON SAID DANGLARS WITH A SMILE
62-121084-0085 STILL I SHOULD NOT THINK THE MORCERFS WOULD YIELD TO THE CAVALCANTI THE MORCERFS
62-121084-0086 YOU ARE A MAN OF THE WORLD ARE YOU NOT I THINK SO AND YOU UNDERSTAND HERALDRY A LITTLE WELL LOOK AT MY COAT OF ARMS IT IS WORTH MORE THAN MORCERF'S
62-121084-0087 WHY SO BECAUSE THOUGH I AM NOT A BARON BY BIRTH
62-121084-0088 WELL WHAT THEN WHILE HIS NAME IS NOT MORCERF HOW NOT MORCERF NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD GO ON I HAVE BEEN MADE A BARON
62-121084-0089 SO THAT I ACTUALLY AM ONE HE MADE HIMSELF A COUNT SO THAT HE IS NOT ONE AT ALL IMPOSSIBLE
62-121084-0090 OR RATHER MY ACQUAINTANCE DURING THE LAST THIRTY YEARS YOU KNOW I HAVE MADE THE MOST OF MY ARMS THOUGH I NEVER FORGOT MY ORIGIN A PROOF OF GREAT HUMILITY OR GREAT PRIDE SAID MONTE CRISTO
62-121084-0091 WELL WHEN I WAS A CLERK MORCERF WAS A MERE FISHERMAN AND THEN HE WAS CALLED FERNAND
62-121084-0092 FERNAND MONDEGO YOU ARE SURE PARDIEU I HAVE BOUGHT ENOUGH FISH OF HIM TO KNOW HIS NAME
62-121084-0093 BOTH HAVING BECOME NOBLE BOTH RICH ARE ABOUT EQUAL IN WORTH EXCEPTING THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CERTAIN THINGS MENTIONED OF HIM THAT WERE NEVER SAID OF ME
62-121084-0094 OH NOTHING AH YES
62-121084-0095 I HAVE HEARD THAT NAME IN GREECE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AFFAIRS OF ALI PASHA EXACTLY SO
62-121084-0096 I ACKNOWLEDGE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING TO FIND IT OUT IT WOULD BE VERY EASY IF YOU MUCH WISHED IT HOW SO PROBABLY YOU HAVE SOME CORRESPONDENT IN GREECE I SHOULD THINK SO AT YANINA
62-121084-0097 EVERYWHERE WELL WRITE TO YOUR CORRESPONDENT IN YANINA AND ASK HIM
62-121084-0098 IN THE CATASTROPHE OF ALI TEPELINI
62-121084-0099 I WILL WRITE TO DAY DO SO I WILL AND IF YOU SHOULD HEAR OF ANYTHING VERY SCANDALOUS
