7073-114963-0000 IT WAS A BLEAK NOVEMBER MORNING IN THE DREARY LITTLE VILLAGE OF TWELVE TREES NATURE HERSELF SEEMED HOPELESS AND DISGUSTED WITH THE UNIVERSE AS THE CHILL MISTS STOLE WEARILY AMONG THE BARE TREES
7073-114963-0001 AND THE BOUGHS DRIPPED WITH A CLAMMY MOISTURE THAT HAD NOTHING OF THE ENERGY OF TEARS TWELVE TREES WAS A POOR LITTLE VILLAGE AT THE BEST OF TIMES BUT THE PAST SUMMER HAD BEEN MORE THAN USUALLY UNKIND TO IT
7073-114963-0002 AND THE LEAN WHEAT FIELDS AND THE RAGGED ORCHARDS HAD BEEN LEANER AND MORE RAGGED THAN EVER BEFORE SO SAID THE MEMORY OF THE OLDEST VILLAGERS THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TO EAT IN THE VILLAGE OF TWELVE TREES AND PRACTICALLY NO MONEY AT ALL
7073-114963-0003 BUT THIS WAS NO COMFORT TO THE GAUNT AND SHIVERING CHILDREN LEFT TO THEMSELVES ON THE CHILL DOOR STEPS HALF HEARTEDLY TRYING TO PLAY THEIR INNOCENT LITTLE GAMES
7073-114963-0004 EVEN THE HEART OF CHILDHOOD FELT THE SHADOWS THAT NOVEMBER MORNING IN THE DREARY LITTLE VILLAGE OF TWELVE TREES
7073-114963-0005 AND MOVED ABOUT WITH A DANK HOPELESSNESS EVIDENTLY EXPECTING NOTHING IN THE SHAPE OF DISCARDED FISH OR TRANSFIGURING SMELLS THERE WAS NO LIFE IN THE LONG DISHEVELED HIGH STREET
7073-114963-0006 THERE WAS NOTHING TO GET UP FOR AND NO WORK WORTH DOING SO NATURALLY IN ALL THIS ECHOING EMPTINESS THIS LACK OF EXCITEMENT ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED ATTRACTED A GRATEFULLY ALERT ATTENTION
7073-114963-0007 EVEN FROM THOSE CATS AND DOGS SO SADLY PROWLING AMID THE DEJECTED REFUSE OF THE VILLAGE
7073-114963-0008 THE BLANK NOTHINGNESS OF THE DAMP DESERTED STREET THERE WAS TO BE SEEN APPROACHING FROM THE SOUTH A CURIOUS LITTLE FIGURE OF AN OLD MAN TRUNDLING AT HIS SIDE A STRANGE APPARATUS RESEMBLING A KNIFE GRINDER'S WHEEL
7073-114963-0009 AND HE CARRIED SOME FORLORN OLD UMBRELLAS UNDER ONE ARM EVIDENTLY HE WAS AN ITINERANT KNIFE GRINDER AND UMBRELLA MENDER AS HE PROCEEDED UP THE STREET HE CALLED OUT SOME STRANGE SING SONG
7073-114963-0010 THE WORDS OF WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH BUT THOUGH HIS CRY WAS MELANCHOLY HIS OLD PUCKERED AND WIZENED FACE SEEMED TO BE ALIGHT WITH SOME INNER AND INEXTINGUISHABLE GLADNESS AND HIS ELECTRICAL BLUE EYES STARTLINGLY SET IN A NETWORK OF WRINKLES
7073-114963-0011 WERE AS FULL OF LAUGHTER AS A BOY'S HIS CRY ATTRACTED A WEARY FACE HERE AND THERE AT WINDOW AND DOOR BUT SEEING NOTHING BUT AN OLD KNIFE GRINDER THE FACES LOST INTEREST AND IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED
7073-114963-0012 THE CHILDREN HOWEVER BEING LESS SOPHISTICATED WERE FILLED WITH A GRATEFUL CURIOSITY TOWARD THE STRANGER AND LEFT THE CHILL DOOR STEPS AND TROOPED ABOUT HIM IN WONDER A LITTLE GIRL WITH TEARS MAKING CHANNELS DOWN HER PALE UNWASHED FACE
7073-114963-0013 CAUGHT THE OLD MAN'S EYE LITTLE ONE HE SAID WITH A MAGICAL SMILE AND A VOICE ALL REASSURING LOVE GIVE ME ONE OF THOSE TEARS AND I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT I CAN MAKE OF IT
7073-114963-0014 AND HE TOUCHED THE CHILD'S FACE WITH HIS HAND AND CAUGHT ONE OF HER TEARS ON HIS FINGER AND PLACED IT GLITTERING ON HIS WHEEL THEN WORKING A PEDAL WITH HIS FOOT THE WHEEL BEGAN TO MOVE SO SWIFTLY
7073-114963-0015 THAT ONE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT ITS WHIRLING AND AS IT WHIRLED WONDERFUL COLORED RAYS BEGAN TO RISE FROM IT SO THAT PRESENTLY THE DREARY STREET SEEMED FULL OF RAINBOWS THE SAD HOUSES WERE LIT UP WITH A FAIRY RADIANCE
7073-114963-0016 AND THE FACES OF THE CHILDREN WERE ALL LAUGHTER AGAIN WELL LITTLE ONE HE SAID WHEN THE WHEEL STOPPED WHIRLING DID YOU LIKE WHAT I MADE OUT OF THAT SAD LITTLE TEAR AND THE CHILDREN LAUGHED AND BEGGED HIM TO DO SOME OTHER TRICK FOR THEM
7073-114963-0017 INDESCRIBABLY DIRTY AND BEDRAGGLED TALKING TO HERSELF AND LAUGHING IN A CREEPY WAY THE VILLAGE KNEW HER AS CRAZY SAL AND THE CHILDREN WERE ACCUSTOMED TO MAKE CRUEL SPORT OF HER AS SHE CAME NEAR THEY BEGAN TO JEER AT HER
7073-114963-0018 WITH THE HEARTLESSNESS OF YOUNG UNKNOWING THINGS
7073-114963-0019 STAY CHILDREN HE SAID AND WATCH AND AS HE SAID THIS HIS WHEEL WENT WHIRLING AGAIN AND AS IT WHIRLED A LIGHT SHOT OUT FROM IT SO THAT IT ILLUMINATED THE POOR OLD WOMAN
7073-114963-0020 AND IN ITS RADIANCE SHE BECAME STRANGELY TRANSFIGURED IN PLACE OF CRAZY SAL WHOM THEY HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO MOCK THE CHILDREN SAW A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL ALL BLUSHES AND BRIGHT EYES AND PRETTY RIBBONS
7073-114963-0021 THAT IT DREW TO THE DOOR STEPS THEIR FATHERS AND MOTHERS WHO ALSO SAW CRAZY SAL AS NONE OF THEM HAD EVER SEEN HER BEFORE EXCEPT A VERY OLD MAN WHO REMEMBERED HER AS A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL AND REMEMBERED TOO
7073-114963-0022 HOW HER MIND HAD GONE FROM HER AS THE NEWS CAME ONE DAY THAT HER SWEETHEART A SAILOR HAD BEEN DROWNED IN THE NORTH SEA
7073-114963-0023 ARE YOU A WIZARD THAT YOU CHANGE A CHILD'S TEARS INTO LAUGHTER
7073-114963-0024 YOU MUST BE OF THE DEVIL
7073-114963-0025 AND ONCE MORE HIS WHEEL WENT WHIRRING AND AGAIN THAT STRANGE LIGHT SHOT OUT FROM IT AND SPREAD FAR PAST THE HOUSES OVER THE FIELDS BEYOND
7073-114963-0026 THEY APPEARED WAVING WITH GOLDEN GRAIN WAITING FOR THE SCYTHE AND AGAIN AS THE WHEEL STOPPED WHIRRING THE OLD MAN WHO HAD REMEMBERED CRAZY SAL AS A YOUNG GIRL SPOKE TO THE KNIFE GRINDER AGAIN HE ASKED
7073-114963-0027 WHAT AND WHO ARE YOU ARE YOU A WIZARD THAT YOU CHANGE A CHILD'S TEARS INTO LAUGHTER AND TURN AN OLD HALF WITTED WOMAN BACK TO A YOUNG GIRL AND MAKE OF A BARREN GLEBE A WAVING CORN FIELD
7073-114963-0028 AND THE MAN WITH THE STRANGE WHEEL ANSWERED I AM THE MAKER OF RAINBOWS I AM THE ALCHEMIST OF HOPE TO ME NOVEMBER IS ALWAYS MAY TEARS ARE ALWAYS LAUGHTER THAT IS GOING TO BE
7073-114963-0029 AND DARKNESS IS LIGHT MISUNDERSTOOD THE SAD HEART MAKES ITS OWN SORROW THE HAPPY HEART MAKES ITS OWN JOY THE HARVEST IS MADE BY THE HARVESTMAN AND THERE IS NOTHING HARD OR BLACK OR WEARY THAT IS NOT WAITING FOR THE MAGIC TOUCH
7073-114963-0030 OF HOPE TO BECOME SOFT AS A SPRING FLOWER BRIGHT AS THE MORNING STAR AND VALIANT AS A YOUNG RUNNER IN THE DAWN BUT THE VILLAGE OF TWELVE TREES WAS NOT TO BE CONVINCED BY SUCH WORDS MADE OUT OF MOONSHINE
7073-114963-0031 ONLY THE CHILDREN BELIEVED IN THE LAUGHING OLD MAN WITH THE STRANGE WHEEL RAINBOWS MOCKED THEIR FATHERS AND MOTHERS RAINBOWS MUCH GOOD ARE RAINBOWS TO A STARVING VILLAGE THE OLD MAKER OF RAINBOWS TOOK THEIR TAUNTS IN SILENCE
7073-114963-0032 AND MADE READY TO GO HIS WAY BUT AS HE STARTED ONCE MORE ALONG THE ROAD HE SAID WITH A CYNICAL SMILE HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD THAT THERE IS A POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW A POT OF GOLD CRIED OUT THE WHOLE VILLAGE OF TWELVE TREES
7073-114963-0033 YES HE ANSWERED A POT OF GOLD I KNOW WHERE IT IS AND I AM GOING TO FIND IT AND HE MOVED ON HIS WAY THEN THE VILLAGERS LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN A POT OF GOLD
7073-114963-0034 AND SET OUT TO ACCOMPANY THE OLD VISITOR BUT WHEN THEY REACHED THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE VILLAGE THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HIM HE HAD MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED
