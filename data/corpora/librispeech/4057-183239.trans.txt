4057-183239-0000 VAST NUMBERS OF MILITARY GENTLEMEN HE OBSERVED AT THE FRONT GO CLANKING ABOUT IN SPURS ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE NEVER HAD AND NEVER WILL HAVE OCCASION TO BESTRIDE A HORSE SPURS ARE A SYMBOLIC SURVIVAL
4057-183239-0001 A WASTE OF STEEL AND OF LABOUR IN MANUFACTURE A FUTILE EXPENDITURE OF ENERGY TO KEEP CLEAN AND TO PUT ON AND TAKE OFF WHEN I FIRST ENLISTED I FELT A SIMILAR IRRITATION IN REGARD TO BUTTONS
4057-183239-0002 HIS BUTTONS ARE A BURDEN TO THE NEW RECRUIT TIME TAKES THE EDGE OFF HIS RESENTMENT TIME IS A SOOTHER OF SORROWS A HEALER OF RANCOURS HOWEVER LEGITIMATE NEVERTHELESS ONE'S BUTTONS REMAIN FOR EVER A NUISANCE
4057-183239-0003 I DO NOT COMPLAIN THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE MY BED POLISH MY BOOTS KEEP MY CLOTHES NEAT THESE ARE THE OBVIOUS DECENCIES OF LIFE BUT THE DAILY SHINING UP OF METAL BUTTONS WHICH NEED NEVER HAVE BEEN MADE OF METAL AT ALL
4057-183239-0004 WHICH TARNISH IN THE DAMP AND INDEED LOSE THEIR LUSTRE IN AN HOUR IN ANY WEATHER WHICH MOREOVER LOOK MUCH PRETTIER DULL THAN BRIGHT THIS IS ENOUGH TO CONVERT THE MOST BLOODTHIRSTY RECRUIT INTO OBDURATE PACIFISM
4057-183239-0005 IT IS TO BE PRESUMED THAT IN THE PIPE CLAYING DAYS OF PEACE THE HOURS WERE APT TO HANG HEAVY IN BARRACKS AND THE FURBISHING OF BUTTONS WAS DEVISED NOT ALONE FOR SMARTNESS SAKE BUT TO OCCUPY IDLE HANDS
4057-183239-0006 FOR WHICH OTHERWISE SATAN MIGHT BE FINDING SOME MORE MISCHIEVOUS EMPLOYMENT THE THEORY THOUGH IT THROWS A LURID LIGHT ON THE UNPROFITABLENESS OF A SOLDIER'S PROFESSION WHEN THERE IS NO WAR TO JUSTIFY HIS EXISTENCE
4057-183239-0007 IS NOT DEVOID OF SENSE BUT WHY THIS CUSTOM DESIGNED FOR THAT EXCELLENT MORTAL THE T ATKINS WHO WALKED OUT WITH NURSE MAIDS AND WAS NONE TOO BUSY BETWEEN WHILES SHOULD BE FORCED UPON A TOTALLY DIFFERENT IF NO LESS ESTIMABLE
4057-183239-0008 T ATKINS WHOSE JOB HARDLY GIVES HIM A MOMENT FOR MEALS LET ALONE FOR DALLIANCE WITH THE FAIR I CANNOT PRETEND TO FATHOM IT IS ARGUABLE THAT THE ORNAMENTAL SOLDIER IS SUITED BY GLOSSY BUTTONS
4057-183239-0009 AND MAY PROPERLY LAVISH TIME AND TROUBLE THEREUPON IT IS NOT ARGUABLE THAT GLOSSY BUTTONS ARE A VALID FEATURE OF THE GARB OF A HUMDRUM AND HARASSED HOSPITAL ORDERLY MANY A TIME
4057-183239-0010 FOOTSORE AND ACHING WITH NOVEL TOIL I COULD HAVE GROANED WHEN INSTEAD OF LYING DOWN TO RELAX I HAD TO TACKLE THE POLISHING OF THAT IDIOTIC PANOPLY OF BUTTONS MY TUNIC HAD IT STILL HAS
4057-183239-0011 FIVE LARGE BUTTONS IN FRONT FOUR POCKET FLAP BUTTONS TWO SHOULDER BUTTONS AND TWO SHOULDER NUMERALS T R A M C
4057-183239-0012 MY GREAT COAT HAD IT STILL HAS FIVE LARGE FRONT BUTTONS TWO SHOULDER BUTTONS AND TWO SHOULDER NUMERALS THREE BACK BELT BUTTONS TWO COAT TAIL BUTTONS MY CAP HAD IT STILL HAS
4057-183239-0013 A BADGE AND TWO SMALL STRAP BUTTONS ALL THESE MUST BE KEPT BRILLIANT AND IN ADDITION THERE WAS THE INTRICATE BRASSWORK OF ONE'S BELT ARE THE WOUNDED ANY BETTER LOOKED AFTER BECAUSE A TIRED ORDERLY
4057-183239-0014 HAS SPENT SOME OF HIS OFF DUTY REST HOUR IN RUBBING METAL BUTTONS WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN EVERY BIT AS BUTTONABLE HAD THEY BEEN MADE OF BONE MANY WERE THE DEBATES IN OUR HUT OVER THE BUTTON PROBLEM
4057-183239-0015 THE ABOLITION OF METAL BUTTONS BEING IMPRACTICABLE THE BOLD PROJECT OF A PETITION TO THE KING AND LORD KITCHENER WAS NEVER PROCEEDED WITH TWO QUESTIONS ALONE INTERESTED US ONE WHICH WAS THE BEST POLISH AND TWO
4057-183239-0016 WHICH WAS THE QUICKEST AND EASIEST SYSTEM OF POLISHING THE SHABBY PEDDLER CUM BOOT MAKER WHO HAD SOMEHOW ESTABLISHED AT THAT PERIOD A MONOPOLY OF THE MINOR TRADE OF OUR CAMP VENDED A SUBSTANCE IN PENNY TINS CALLED SOLDIER'S FRIEND
4057-183239-0017 HAVING AS PER THE INSTRUCTIONS MOISTENED IT IN OTHER WORDS SPAT UPON IT YOU WORKED UP A MODICUM OF THE RESULTING PINK MUD WITH AN OLD TOOTHBRUSH THEN APPLIED SAME TO EACH BUTTON
4057-183239-0018 WHEN YOU HAD RUBBED A PINK FILM ON TO THE BUTTON YOU PROCEEDED TO RUB IT OFF AGAIN AND LO THE TARNISH HAD DEPARTED LIKE AN EVIL DREAM AND THE METAL GLISTENED AS IF FRESH FROM THE MINT IF YOU WERE VERY PARTICULAR
4057-183239-0019 THEREAFTER YOU LOST THE LAST PRECIOUS FIVE MINUTES BEFORE PARADE IN EFFORTS WITH KNIFE BLADE OR CLOTHESBRUSH TO REMOVE FROM YOUR TUNIC THE SMEARS OF PINK PASTE WHICH HAD FAILED TO REPOSE ON THE BUTTONS AND HAD STUCK TO THE SURROUNDING CLOTH INSTEAD
4057-183239-0020 LUCKILY SOLDIER'S FRIEND DRIES AND CAKES AND POWDERS OFF FAIRLY QUICKLY IT IS A LOVABLE SUBSTANCE IN ITS SIMPLE BEHAVIOUR ITS LACK OF COMPLICATIONS I SURMISE THAT SOMEBODY HAS MADE A FORTUNE
4057-183239-0021 OUT OF MANUFACTURING MILLIONS OF THOSE PENNY TINS THERE IS AT LEAST ONE IMITATION OF SOLDIER'S FRIEND ON THE MARKET AND LIKE MOST IMITATIONS IT IS NEITHER BETTER NOR WORSE THAN THE ORIGINAL
4057-183239-0022 EXCEPT FOR THE NAME ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE TIN THE TWO COMMODITIES CANNOT BE TOLD APART NO DOUBT THE IMITATOR HAS LIKEWISE MADE A FORTUNE IF SO BOTH FORTUNES HAVE BEEN AMASSED FROM A FOIBLE
4057-183239-0023 TO WHOSE BLATANT USELESSNESS AND WASTEFULNESS EVEN A BOND STREET JEWELLER OR A DE LUXE HOTEL CHEF WOULD BE ASHAMED TO GIVE COUNTENANCE ONE MEMBER OF THE HUT'S COMPANY MORE FASTIDIOUS THAN HIS FELLOWS
4057-183239-0024 RATHER THAN DO SO HE WOULD TRAMP THE FIFTY YARDS TO OUR WASH PLACE AND OBTAIN A COUPLE OF DROPS OF WATER FROM THE TAP THE SAME MAN THOUGHT NOTHING OF KEEPING A HALF CONSUMED HAM SOME DECAYING FRUIT
4057-183239-0025 AND AN OPENED POT OF BOVRIL ALL WRAPPED
4057-183239-0026 THAT IS BY THE WAY I AM HERE CONCERNED NOT WITH HUMAN NATURE BUT WITH BUTTONS PLAIN WATER HOWEVER WAS VOTED LESS EFFECTIVE THAN THE MORE POPULAR LIQUID THE SCIENTIFICALLY MINDED HAD A NOTION THAT HUMAN SPITTLE
4057-183239-0027 CONTAINED SOME ACID WHICH NATURE HAD EVOLVED SPECIALLY TO ASSIST THE ACTION OF SOLDIER'S FRIEND I AM BOUND TO SAY THAT I WAS OF THE ANTI PLAIN WATER PARTY MYSELF FOR A SPACE I BECAME AN ADHERENT OF THE EXPERIMENTALISTS
4057-183239-0028 WHO MOISTENED THEIR SOLDIER'S FRIEND WITH METHYLATED SPIRIT ALLEGING THAT THE ENSUING POLISH WAS MORE PERMANENT I LAPSED MY SMALL BOTTLE OF METHYLATED SPIRIT CAME TO AN END AND ON REFLECTION
4057-183239-0029 I WAS NOT SURE THAT ITS SUPERIORITY OVER SPITTLE HAD BEEN PROVED NOTHING IN THE ENGLISH CLIMATE CAN MAKE THE SHEEN OF METAL BUTTONS ENDURE AT THE OUTSIDE MORE THAN ONE DAY BLUEBELL SILVO
4057-183239-0030 AND THE OTHER CHEMICO FRICTIONAL PREPARATIONS IN FAVOUR OF WHICH I ULTIMATELY ABANDONED SOLDIER'S FRIEND ARE ALIKE IN THIS THAT THEIR VIRTUE LIES IN FREQUENT APPLICATION DILIGENCE AND ELBOW GREASE THEY ARE EVERY ONE EXCELLENT
4057-183239-0031 THEIR INVENTORS DESERVE OUR GRATITUDE BUT OUR GRATITUDE TO THEIR INVENTORS MUST BE NOTHING COMPARED WITH THEIR INVENTORS GRATITUDE
