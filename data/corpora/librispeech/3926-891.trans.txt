3926-891-0000 NOW THAT IS TO ME A VERY AMAZING THING AMAZING FOR THE LIGHT OF POSSIBILITIES THAT IT CASTS INTO THE HUMAN HEART FOR I HAD NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST CONSCIOUS IDEA OF MARRYING THE GIRL
3926-891-0001 I NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST IDEA EVEN OF CARING FOR HER I MUST HAVE TALKED IN AN ODD WAY AS PEOPLE DO WHO ARE RECOVERING FROM AN ANAESTHETIC IT IS AS IF ONE HAD A DUAL PERSONALITY THE ONE I
3926-891-0002 BEING ENTIRELY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE OTHER I HAD THOUGHT NOTHING I HAD SAID SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY THING I DON'T KNOW THAT ANALYSIS OF MY OWN PSYCHOLOGY MATTERS AT ALL TO THIS STORY I SHOULD SAY THAT IT DIDN'T OR AT ANY RATE
3926-891-0003 THAT I HAD GIVEN ENOUGH OF IT BUT THAT ODD REMARK OF MINE HAD A STRONG INFLUENCE UPON WHAT CAME AFTER I MEAN
3926-891-0004 IF I HADN'T SAID TWO HOURS AFTER MY WIFE'S DEATH NOW I CAN MARRY THE GIRL SHE HAD THEN TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED THAT I HAD BEEN SUFFERING ALL THAT SHE HAD BEEN SUFFERING OR AT LEAST
3926-891-0005 THAT I HAD PERMITTED ALL THAT SHE HAD PERMITTED SO THAT A MONTH AGO ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THE FUNERAL OF POOR EDWARD SHE COULD SAY TO ME IN THE MOST NATURAL WAY IN THE WORLD
3926-891-0006 SHE SAID WITH HER CLEAR REFLECTIVE INTONATION OH STOP HERE FOR EVER AND EVER IF YOU CAN AND THEN SHE ADDED YOU COULDN'T BE MORE OF A BROTHER TO ME OR MORE OF A COUNSELLOR OR MORE OF A SUPPORT
3926-891-0007 YOU ARE ALL THE CONSOLATION I HAVE IN THE WORLD AND ISN'T IT ODD TO THINK THAT IF YOUR WIFE HADN'T BEEN MY HUSBAND'S MISTRESS YOU WOULD PROBABLY NEVER HAVE BEEN HERE AT ALL THAT WAS HOW I GOT THE NEWS FULL IN THE FACE LIKE THAT
3926-891-0008 I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING AND I DON'T SUPPOSE I FELT ANYTHING UNLESS MAYBE IT WAS WITH THAT MYSTERIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS SELF THAT UNDERLIES MOST PEOPLE PERHAPS ONE DAY WHEN I AM UNCONSCIOUS OR WALKING IN MY SLEEP I MAY GO AND SPIT UPON POOR EDWARD'S GRAVE
3926-891-0009 IT SEEMS ABOUT THE MOST UNLIKELY THING I COULD DO BUT THERE IT IS NO I REMEMBER NO EMOTION OF ANY SORT BUT JUST THE CLEAR FEELING THAT ONE HAS FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN ONE HEARS THAT SOME MISSUS SO AND SO IS AU MIEUX WITH A CERTAIN GENTLEMAN
3926-891-0010 IT MADE THINGS PLAINER SUDDENLY TO MY CURIOSITY IT WAS AS IF I THOUGHT AT THAT MOMENT OF A WINDY NOVEMBER EVENING THAT WHEN I CAME TO THINK IT OVER AFTERWARDS A DOZEN UNEXPLAINED THINGS WOULD FIT THEMSELVES INTO PLACE
3926-891-0011 BUT I WASN'T THINKING THINGS OVER THEN I REMEMBER THAT DISTINCTLY I WAS JUST SITTING BACK RATHER STIFFLY IN A DEEP ARM CHAIR THAT IS WHAT I REMEMBER IT WAS TWILIGHT
3926-891-0012 BRANSHAW MANOR LIES IN A LITTLE HOLLOW WITH LAWNS ACROSS IT AND PINE WOODS ON THE FRINGE OF THE DIP THE IMMENSE WIND COMING FROM ACROSS THE FOREST ROARED OVERHEAD BUT THE VIEW FROM THE WINDOW WAS PERFECTLY QUIET AND GREY
3926-891-0013 NOT A THING STIRRED EXCEPT A COUPLE OF RABBITS ON THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE LAWN IT WAS LEONORA'S OWN LITTLE STUDY THAT WE WERE IN AND WE WERE WAITING FOR THE TEA TO BE BROUGHT I AS I SAID WAS SITTING IN THE DEEP CHAIR
3926-891-0014 LEONORA WAS STANDING IN THE WINDOW TWIRLING THE WOODEN ACORN AT THE END OF THE WINDOW BLIND CORD DESULTORILY ROUND AND ROUND SHE LOOKED ACROSS THE LAWN AND SAID AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER EDWARD HAS BEEN DEAD ONLY TEN DAYS AND YET THERE ARE RABBITS ON THE LAWN
3926-891-0015 I UNDERSTAND THAT RABBITS DO A GREAT DEAL OF HARM TO THE SHORT GRASS IN ENGLAND AND THEN SHE TURNED ROUND TO ME AND SAID WITHOUT ANY ADORNMENT AT ALL FOR I REMEMBER HER EXACT WORDS I THINK IT WAS STUPID OF FLORENCE TO COMMIT SUICIDE
3926-891-0016 I CANNOT TELL YOU THE EXTRAORDINARY SENSE OF LEISURE THAT WE TWO SEEMED TO HAVE AT THAT MOMENT IT WASN'T AS IF WE WERE WAITING FOR A TRAIN IT WASN'T AS IF WE WERE WAITING FOR A MEAL IT WAS JUST THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO WAIT FOR
3926-891-0017 NOTHING THERE WAS AN EXTREME STILLNESS WITH THE REMOTE AND INTERMITTENT SOUND OF THE WIND THERE WAS THE GREY LIGHT IN THAT BROWN SMALL ROOM AND THERE APPEARED TO BE NOTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD I KNEW THEN
3926-891-0018 THAT LEONORA WAS ABOUT TO LET ME INTO HER FULL CONFIDENCE IT WAS AS IF OR NO IT WAS THE ACTUAL FACT THAT LEONORA WITH AN ODD ENGLISH SENSE OF DECENCY HAD DETERMINED TO WAIT UNTIL EDWARD HAD BEEN IN HIS GRAVE FOR A FULL WEEK BEFORE SHE SPOKE
3926-891-0019 AND WITH SOME VAGUE MOTIVE OF GIVING HER AN IDEA OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH SHE MUST PERMIT HERSELF TO MAKE CONFIDENCES I SAID SLOWLY AND THESE WORDS TOO I REMEMBER WITH EXACTITUDE DID FLORENCE COMMIT SUICIDE
3926-891-0020 I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS JUST YOU UNDERSTAND TRYING TO LET HER KNOW THAT IF SHE WERE GOING TO SPEAK SHE WOULD HAVE TO TALK ABOUT A MUCH WIDER RANGE OF THINGS THAN SHE HAD BEFORE THOUGHT NECESSARY
3926-891-0021 THAT FLORENCE HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE IT HAD NEVER ENTERED MY HEAD YOU MAY THINK THAT I HAD BEEN SINGULARLY LACKING IN SUSPICIOUSNESS
3926-891-0022 BUT CONSIDER THE POSITION IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES OF CLAMOUR OF OUTCRY OF THE CRASH OF MANY PEOPLE RUNNING TOGETHER OF THE PROFESSIONAL RETICENCE OF SUCH PEOPLE AS HOTEL KEEPERS
3926-891-0023 THE TRADITIONAL RETICENCE OF SUCH GOOD PEOPLE AS THE ASHBURNHAMS IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS SOME LITTLE MATERIAL OBJECT ALWAYS THAT CATCHES THE EYE AND THAT APPEALS TO THE IMAGINATION
3926-891-0024 I HAD NO POSSIBLE GUIDE TO THE IDEA OF SUICIDE AND THE SIGHT OF THE LITTLE FLASK OF NITRATE OF AMYL IN FLORENCE'S HAND SUGGESTED INSTANTLY TO MY MIND
3926-891-0025 NITRATE OF AMYL YOU UNDERSTAND IS THE DRUG THAT IS GIVEN TO RELIEVE SUFFERERS FROM ANGINA PECTORIS SEEING FLORENCE AS I HAD SEEN HER RUNNING WITH A WHITE FACE AND WITH ONE HAND HELD OVER HER HEART
3926-891-0026 AND SEEING HER AS I IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS SAW HER LYING UPON HER BED WITH THE SO FAMILIAR LITTLE BROWN FLASK CLENCHED IN HER FINGERS IT WAS NATURAL ENOUGH FOR MY MIND TO FRAME THE IDEA AS HAPPENED NOW AND AGAIN I THOUGHT
3926-891-0027 SHE HAD GONE OUT WITHOUT HER REMEDY AND HAVING FELT AN ATTACK COMING ON WHILST SHE WAS IN THE GARDENS SHE HAD RUN IN TO GET THE NITRATE IN ORDER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN RELIEF AND IT WAS EQUALLY INEVITABLE
3926-891-0028 MY MIND SHOULD FRAME THE THOUGHT THAT HER HEART UNABLE TO STAND THE STRAIN OF THE RUNNING SHOULD HAVE BROKEN IN HER SIDE HOW COULD I HAVE KNOWN THAT DURING ALL THE YEARS OF OUR MARRIED LIFE THAT LITTLE BROWN FLASK HAD CONTAINED
3926-891-0029 NOT NITRATE OF AMYL BUT PRUSSIC ACID IT WAS INCONCEIVABLE WHY NOT EVEN EDWARD ASHBURNHAM WHO WAS AFTER ALL MORE INTIMATE WITH HER THAN I WAS HAD AN INKLING OF THE TRUTH HE JUST THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD DROPPED DEAD OF HEART DISEASE
3926-891-0030 INDEED I FANCY THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO EVER KNEW THAT FLORENCE HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE WERE LEONORA THE GRAND DUKE THE HEAD OF THE POLICE AND THE HOTEL KEEPER I MENTION THESE LAST THREE BECAUSE MY RECOLLECTION OF THAT NIGHT
3926-891-0031 IS ONLY THE SORT OF PINKISH EFFULGENCE FROM THE ELECTRIC LAMPS IN THE HOTEL LOUNGE THERE SEEMED TO BOB INTO MY CONSCIOUSNESS LIKE FLOATING GLOBES THE FACES OF THOSE THREE NOW IT WOULD BE THE BEARDED
3926-891-0032 MONARCHICAL BENEVOLENT HEAD OF THE GRAND DUKE THEN THE SHARP FEATURED BROWN CAVALRY MOUSTACHED FEATURE OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE THEN THE GLOBULAR POLISHED AND HIGH COLLARED VACUOUSNESS THAT REPRESENTED MONSIEUR SCHONTZ
3926-891-0033 THE PROPRIETOR OF THE HOTEL AT TIMES ONE HEAD WOULD BE THERE ALONE AT ANOTHER THE SPIKED HELMET OF THE OFFICIAL WOULD BE CLOSE TO THE HEALTHY BALDNESS OF THE PRINCE
3926-891-0034 THE SOVEREIGN'S SOFT EXQUISITELY TRAINED VOICE WOULD SAY JA JA JA EACH WORD DROPPING OUT LIKE SO MANY SOFT PELLETS OF SUET THE SUBDUED RASP OF THE OFFICIAL WOULD COME ZUM BEFEHL DURCHLAUCHT
3926-891-0035 LIKE FIVE REVOLVER SHOTS
3926-891-0036 UNDER ITS BREATH LIKE THAT OF AN UNCLEAN PRIEST RECITING FROM HIS BREVIARY IN THE CORNER OF A RAILWAY CARRIAGE THAT WAS HOW IT PRESENTED ITSELF TO ME THEY SEEMED TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF ME
3926-891-0037 I DON'T SUPPOSE THAT I WAS EVEN ADDRESSED BY ONE OF THEM BUT AS LONG AS ONE OR THE OTHER OR ALL THREE OF THEM WERE THERE THEY STOOD BETWEEN ME AS IF I BEING THE TITULAR POSSESSOR OF THE CORPSE HAD A RIGHT TO BE PRESENT AT THEIR CONFERENCES
3926-891-0038 THEN THEY ALL WENT AWAY AND I WAS LEFT ALONE FOR A LONG TIME AND I THOUGHT NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING I HAD NO IDEAS I HAD NO STRENGTH I FELT NO SORROW NO DESIRE FOR ACTION
3926-891-0039 NO INCLINATION TO GO UPSTAIRS AND FALL UPON THE BODY OF MY WIFE I JUST SAW THE PINK EFFULGENCE THE CANE TABLES THE PALMS THE GLOBULAR MATCH HOLDERS THE INDENTED ASH TRAYS AND THEN LEONORA CAME TO ME
3926-891-0040 AND IT APPEARS THAT I ADDRESSED TO HER THAT SINGULAR REMARK NOW I CAN MARRY THE GIRL BUT I HAVE GIVEN YOU ABSOLUTELY THE WHOLE OF MY RECOLLECTION OF THAT EVENING
3926-891-0041 AS IT IS THE WHOLE OF MY RECOLLECTION OF THE SUCCEEDING THREE OR FOUR DAYS I WAS IN A STATE JUST SIMPLY CATALEPTIC THEY PUT ME TO BED AND I STAYED THERE THEY BROUGHT ME MY CLOTHES AND I DRESSED
3926-891-0042 THEY LED ME TO AN OPEN GRAVE AND I STOOD BESIDE IT IF THEY HAD TAKEN ME TO THE EDGE OF A RIVER OR IF THEY HAD FLUNG ME BENEATH A RAILWAY TRAIN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DROWNED OR MANGLED IN THE SAME SPIRIT I WAS THE WALKING DEAD WELL THOSE ARE MY IMPRESSIONS
3926-891-0043 I PIECED IT TOGETHER AFTERWARDS YOU WILL REMEMBER I SAID THAT EDWARD ASHBURNHAM AND THE GIRL HAD GONE OFF THAT NIGHT TO A CONCERT AT THE CASINO AND THAT LEONORA HAD ASKED FLORENCE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEIR DEPARTURE TO FOLLOW THEM
3926-891-0044 AND TO PERFORM THE OFFICE OF CHAPERONE FLORENCE YOU MAY ALSO REMEMBER WAS ALL IN BLACK BEING THE MOURNING THAT SHE WORE FOR A DECEASED COUSIN JEAN HURLBIRD IT WAS A VERY BLACK NIGHT AND THE GIRL WAS DRESSED IN CREAM COLOURED MUSLIN
3926-891-0045 THAT MUST HAVE GLIMMERED UNDER THE TALL TREES OF THE DARK PARK LIKE A PHOSPHORESCENT FISH IN A CUPBOARD YOU COULDN'T HAVE HAD A BETTER BEACON AND IT APPEARS THAT EDWARD ASHBURNHAM LED THE GIRL NOT UP THE STRAIGHT ALLEE THAT LEADS TO THE CASINO
3926-891-0046 BUT IN UNDER THE DARK TREES OF THE PARK EDWARD ASHBURNHAM TOLD ME ALL THIS IN HIS FINAL OUTBURST
3926-891-0047 I DIDN'T PUMP HIM I HADN'T ANY MOTIVE AT THAT TIME I DIDN'T IN THE LEAST CONNECT HIM WITH MY WIFE BUT THE FELLOW TALKED LIKE A CHEAP NOVELIST OR LIKE A VERY GOOD NOVELIST FOR THE MATTER OF THAT IF IT'S THE BUSINESS OF A NOVELIST TO MAKE YOU SEE THINGS CLEARLY
3926-891-0048 IT APPEARS THAT NOT VERY FAR FROM THE CASINO HE AND THE GIRL SAT DOWN IN THE DARKNESS UPON A PUBLIC BENCH THE LIGHTS FROM THAT PLACE OF ENTERTAINMENT MUST HAVE REACHED THEM THROUGH THE TREE TRUNKS SINCE EDWARD SAID
3926-891-0049 HE COULD QUITE PLAINLY SEE THE GIRL'S FACE THAT BELOVED FACE WITH THE HIGH FOREHEAD THE QUEER MOUTH THE TORTURED EYEBROWS AND THE DIRECT EYES AND TO FLORENCE CREEPING UP BEHIND THEM THEY MUST HAVE PRESENTED THE APPEARANCE OF SILHOUETTES
3926-891-0050 FOR I TAKE IT THAT FLORENCE CAME CREEPING UP BEHIND THEM OVER THE SHORT GRASS
3926-891-0051 WAS IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THAT PUBLIC SEAT IT WAS NOT A VERY DIFFICULT FEAT FOR A WOMAN INSTINCT WITH JEALOUSY THE CASINO ORCHESTRA WAS AS EDWARD REMEMBERED TO TELL ME PLAYING THE RAKOCSY MARCH
3926-891-0052 AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT LOUD ENOUGH AT THAT DISTANCE TO DROWN THE VOICE OF EDWARD ASHBURNHAM IT WAS CERTAINLY SUFFICIENTLY AUDIBLE TO EFFACE AMONGST THE NOISES OF THE NIGHT THE SLIGHT BRUSHINGS AND RUSTLINGS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE FEET OF FLORENCE
3926-891-0053 OR BY HER GOWN IN COMING OVER THE SHORT GRASS
3926-891-0054 IT MUST HAVE BEEN HORRIBLE FOR HER HORRIBLE WELL I SUPPOSE SHE DESERVED ALL THAT SHE GOT ANYHOW THERE YOU HAVE THE PICTURE THE IMMENSELY TALL TREES ELMS MOST OF THEM
3926-891-0055 THE SILHOUETTES OF THOSE TWO UPON THE SEAT THE BEAMS OF LIGHT COMING FROM THE CASINO THE WOMAN ALL IN BLACK PEEPING WITH FEAR BEHIND THE TREE TRUNK IT IS MELODRAMA BUT I CAN'T HELP IT AND THEN IT APPEARS
3926-891-0056 SOMETHING HAPPENED TO EDWARD ASHBURNHAM HE ASSURED ME AND I SEE NO REASON FOR DISBELIEVING HIM THAT UNTIL THAT MOMENT HE HAD HAD NO IDEA WHATEVER OF CARING FOR THE GIRL
3926-891-0057 HE CERTAINLY LOVED HER BUT WITH A VERY DEEP VERY TENDER AND VERY TRANQUIL LOVE HE HAD MISSED HER WHEN SHE WENT AWAY TO HER CONVENT SCHOOL HE HAD BEEN GLAD WHEN SHE HAD RETURNED BUT OF MORE THAN THAT HE HAD BEEN TOTALLY UNCONSCIOUS
3926-891-0058 HAD HE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF IT HE ASSURED ME
3926-891-0059 HE REALIZED THAT IT WAS THE LAST OUTRAGE UPON LEONORA BUT THE REAL POINT WAS HIS ENTIRE UNCONSCIOUSNESS HE HAD GONE WITH HER INTO THAT DARK PARK WITH NO QUICKENING OF THE PULSE WITH NO DESIRE FOR THE INTIMACY OF SOLITUDE
3926-891-0060 HE HAD GONE INTENDING TO TALK ABOUT POLO PONIES AND TENNIS RACQUETS ABOUT THE TEMPERAMENT OF THE REVEREND MOTHER AT THE CONVENT SHE HAD LEFT AND ABOUT WHETHER HER FROCK FOR A PARTY WHEN THEY GOT HOME SHOULD BE WHITE OR BLUE IT HADN'T COME INTO HIS HEAD
3926-891-0061 THAT THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT A SINGLE THING THAT THEY HADN'T ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT IT HAD NOT EVEN COME INTO HIS HEAD THAT THE TABU WHICH EXTENDED AROUND HER WAS NOT INVIOLABLE AND THEN SUDDENLY THAT HE WAS VERY CAREFUL TO ASSURE ME
3926-891-0062 THAT AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL MOTIVE ABOUT HIS DECLARATION IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HIM TO BE A MATTER OF A DARK NIGHT AND A PROPINQUITY AND SO ON NO IT WAS SIMPLY OF HER EFFECT ON THE MORAL SIDE OF HIS LIFE
3926-891-0063 HE SAID THAT HE NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST NOTION TO ENFOLD HER IN HIS ARMS OR SO MUCH AS TO TOUCH HER HAND HE SWORE THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HER HAND HE SAID THAT THEY SAT SHE AT ONE END OF THE BENCH HE AT THE OTHER
3926-891-0064 HE LEANING SLIGHTLY TOWARDS HER AND SHE LOOKING STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE LIGHT OF THE CASINO HER FACE ILLUMINATED BY THE LAMPS THE EXPRESSION UPON HER FACE HE COULD ONLY DESCRIBE AS QUEER
3926-891-0065 AT ANOTHER TIME INDEED HE MADE IT APPEAR THAT HE THOUGHT SHE WAS GLAD IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE THAT SHE WAS GLAD
3926-891-0066 FRANKLY SHE ADORED EDWARD ASHBURNHAM HE WAS FOR HER IN EVERYTHING THAT SHE SAID AT THAT TIME THE MODEL OF HUMANITY THE HERO THE ATHLETE THE FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY THE LAW GIVER SO THAT FOR HER TO BE SUDDENLY INTIMATELY
3926-891-0067 AND OVERWHELMINGLY PRAISED MUST HAVE BEEN A MATTER FOR MERE GLADNESS HOWEVER OVERWHELMING IT WERE IT MUST HAVE BEEN AS IF A GOD HAD APPROVED HER HANDIWORK OR A KING HER LOYALTY
3926-891-0068 SHE JUST SAT STILL AND LISTENED SMILING AND IT SEEMED TO HER THAT ALL THE BITTERNESS OF HER CHILDHOOD THE TERRORS OF HER TEMPESTUOUS FATHER THE BEWAILINGS OF HER CRUEL TONGUED MOTHER WERE SUDDENLY ATONED FOR
3926-891-0069 SHE HAD HER RECOMPENSE AT LAST BECAUSE OF COURSE IF YOU COME TO FIGURE IT OUT A SUDDEN POURING FORTH OF PASSION BY A MAN WHOM YOU REGARD AS A CROSS BETWEEN A PASTOR AND A FATHER MIGHT TO A WOMAN HAVE THE ASPECT
3926-891-0070 OF MERE PRAISE FOR GOOD CONDUCT IT WOULDN'T I MEAN APPEAR AT ALL IN THE LIGHT OF AN ATTEMPT TO GAIN POSSESSION THE GIRL AT LEAST REGARDED HIM AS FIRMLY ANCHORED TO HIS LEONORA
3926-891-0071 SHE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST INKLING OF ANY INFIDELITIES HE HAD ALWAYS SPOKEN TO HER OF HIS WIFE IN TERMS OF REVERENCE AND DEEP AFFECTION HE HAD GIVEN HER THE IDEA THAT HE REGARDED LEONORA AS ABSOLUTELY IMPECCABLE AND AS ABSOLUTELY SATISFYING
