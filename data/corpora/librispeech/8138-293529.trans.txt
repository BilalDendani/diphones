8138-293529-0000 ALL THIS TIME THE COUNTRY HAD BEEN GOING TO WAR THE HUGE MILITARY MACHINE WAS GETTING UNDER WAY THE STORM OF PUBLIC FEELING WAS RISING CONGRESS HAD VOTED A HUGE LOAN A COUNTRY WIDE MACHINE OF PROPAGANDA WAS BEING ORGANIZED
8138-293529-0001 AND THE ORATORY OF FOUR MINUTE MEN WAS ECHOING FROM MAINE TO CALIFORNIA PETER READ THE AMERICAN CITY TIMES EVERY MORNING AND HERE WERE SPEECHES OF STATESMEN AND SERMONS OF CLERGYMEN HERE WERE CARTOONS AND EDITORIALS
8138-293529-0002 PETER LIKE EVERY OTHER SOUL THAT EVER LIVED NEEDED A RELIGION AN IDEAL THE REDS HAD A RELIGION AS YOU MIGHT CALL IT BUT THIS RELIGION HAD FAILED TO ATTRACT PETER IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WAS LOW
8138-293529-0003 ITS DEVOTEES WERE WHOLLY LACKING IN THE GRACES OF LIFE IN PRESTIGE AND THAT EASE WHICH COMES WITH ASSURANCE OF POWER THEY WERE NOISY IN THEIR FERVORS AND REPELLED PETER AS MUCH AS THE HOLY ROLLERS
8138-293529-0004 ALSO THEY WERE ALWAYS HARPING UPON THE SORDID AND PAINFUL FACTS OF LIFE WHO BUT A PERVERT WOULD LISTEN TO SOB STORIES WHEN HE MIGHT HAVE ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE GLORIOUS AND SHINING AND SPLENDID IN THE WORLD BUT NOW HERE WAS THE RELIGION PETER WANTED
8138-293529-0005 THESE CLERGYMEN IN THEIR ROBES OF SNOW WHITE LINEN PREACHING IN CHURCHES WITH GOLDEN ALTARS AND STAINED GLASS WINDOWS THESE STATESMEN WHO WORE THE HALO OF FAME AND WENT ABOUT WITH THE CHEERING OF THOUSANDS IN THEIR EARS
8138-293529-0006 THESE MIGHTY CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY WHOSE VERY NAMES WERE MAGIC WITH POWER WHEN WRITTEN ON PIECES OF PAPER TO CAUSE CITIES TO RISE IN THE DESERT AND THEN TO FALL AGAIN BENEATH A RAIN OF SHELLS AND POISON GAS
8138-293529-0007 THESE EDITORS AND CARTOONISTS OF THE AMERICAN CITY TIMES WITH ALL THEIR WIT AND LEARNING THESE PEOPLE ALL COMBINED TO CONSTRUCT FOR PETER A RELIGION AND AN IDEAL AND TO HAND IT OUT TO HIM READY MADE AND PRECISELY FITTED TO HIS UNDERSTANDING
8138-293529-0008 WHO HAD ESTABLISHED A SECRET SERVICE BUREAU WITH GUFFEY IN CHARGE OF IT WOULD GO RIGHT ON PUTTING UP THEIR FUNDS AND PAYING PETER FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK AND EXPENSES WHILE HE SERVED THE HOLY CAUSE
8138-293529-0009 IT WAS THE FASHION THESE DAYS FOR ORATORS AND PUBLIC MEN TO VIE WITH ONE ANOTHER IN EXPRESSING THE EXTREMES OF PATRIOTISM AND PETER WOULD READ THESE PHRASES AND CHERISH THEM THEY CAME TO SEEM A PART OF HIM HE FELT AS IF HE HAD INVENTED THEM
8138-293529-0010 HE BECAME GREEDY FOR MORE AND YET MORE OF THIS SOUL FOOD AND THERE WAS ALWAYS MORE TO BE HAD UNTIL PETER'S SOUL WAS BECOME SWOLLEN PUFFED UP AS WITH A BELLOWS PETER BECAME A PATRIOT OF PATRIOTS A SUPER PATRIOT
8138-293529-0011 PETER WAS A RED BLOODED AMERICAN AND NO MOLLYCODDLE PETER WAS A HE AMERICAN A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT AMERICAN
8138-293529-0012 PETER WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT PETER WAS SO MUCH OF AN AMERICAN THAT THE VERY SIGHT OF A FOREIGNER FILLED HIM WITH A FIGHTING IMPULSE AS FOR THE REDS WELL PETER GROPED FOR QUITE A TIME BEFORE HE FINALLY CAME UPON A FORMULA WHICH EXPRESSED HIS FEELINGS
8138-293529-0013 IT WAS A FAMOUS CLERGYMAN WHO ACHIEVED IT FOR HIM SAYING THAT IF HE COULD HAVE HIS WAY HE WOULD TAKE ALL THE REDS AND PUT THEM IN A SHIP OF STONE WITH SAILS OF LEAD AND SEND THEM FORTH WITH HELL FOR THEIR DESTINATION
8138-293529-0014 YOU'RE GETTING YOUR PAY EVERY WEEK WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU THE MATTER IS I'M TIRED OF LISTENING TO THESE FELLOWS RANTING PETER WOULD SAY
8138-293529-0015 YES PETER HAD COME TO TAKE IT AS A PERSONAL AFFRONT THAT THESE RADICALS SHOULD GO ON DENOUNCING THE CAUSE WHICH PETER HAD ESPOUSED THEY ALL THOUGHT OF PETER AS A COMRADE THEY WERE MOST FRIENDLY TO HIM BUT PETER HAD THE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THEY WOULD REGARD HIM WHEN THEY KNEW THE REAL TRUTH
8138-293529-0016 AND THIS IMAGINED CONTEMPT BURNED HIM LIKE AN ACID SOMETIMES THERE WOULD BE TALK ABOUT SPIES AND INFORMERS AND THEN THESE PEOPLE WOULD EXHAUST THEIR VOCABULARY OF ABUSE AND PETER OF COURSE WOULD APPLY EVERY WORD OF IT TO HIMSELF AND BECOME WILD WITH ANGER
8138-293529-0017 HE WOULD LONG TO ANSWER BACK HE WAS WAITING FOR THE DAY WHEN HE MIGHT VINDICATE HIMSELF AND HIS CAUSE BY SMASHING THESE REDS IN THE MOUTH SECTION THIRTY SIX WELL SAID MC GIVNEY ONE DAY
8138-293529-0018 I'VE GOT SOMETHING INTERESTING FOR YOU NOW YOU'RE GOING INTO HIGH SOCIETY FOR A WHILE AND THE RAT FACED MAN EXPLAINED THAT THERE WAS A YOUNG MAN IN A NEIGHBORING CITY REPUTED TO BE A MULTI MILLIONAIRE WHO HAD WRITTEN A BOOK AGAINST THE WAR
8138-293529-0019 AND WAS THE FINANCIAL SOURCE OF MUCH PACIFICISM AND SEDITION THESE PEOPLE ARE SPENDING LOTS OF MONEY FOR PRINTING SAID MC GIVNEY AND WE HEAR THIS FELLOW LACKMAN IS PUTTING IT UP WE'VE LEARNED THAT HE IS TO BE IN TOWN TOMORROW AND WE WANT YOU TO FIND OUT ALL ABOUT HIS AFFAIRS
8138-293529-0020 SO PETER WAS TO MEET A MILLIONAIRE PETER HAD NEVER KNOWN ONE OF THESE FORTUNATE BEINGS BUT HE WAS FOR THEM HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN FOR THEM EVER SINCE HE HAD LEARNED TO READ HE HAD LIKED TO FIND STORIES ABOUT THEM IN THE NEWSPAPERS WITH PICTURES OF THEM AND THEIR PALACES
8138-293529-0021 THEY WERE HIS CREATURES OF DREAMS BELONGING TO A WORLD ABOVE REALITY ABOVE PAIN AND INCONVENIENCE
8138-293529-0022 DEVOTED TO THE CULT OF ELEUTHERINIAN EXOTICISM HE HAD FOUND HANGING IN THE MAIN ASSEMBLY ROOM A PICTURE LABELLED MOUNT OLYMPUS SHOWING A DOZEN GODS AND GODDESSES RECLINING AT EASE ON SILKEN COUCHES
8138-293529-0023 SIPPING NECTAR FROM GOLDEN GOBLETS AND GAZING DOWN UPON THE FAR OFF TROUBLES OF THE WORLD PETER WOULD PEER FROM BEHIND THE CURTAINS AND SEE THE CHIEF MAGISTRIAN EMERGING FROM BEHIND THE SEVEN MYSTIC VEILS LIFTING HIS ROLLING VOICE
8138-293529-0024 AND IN A KIND OF CHANT EXPOUNDING LIFE TO HIS FLOCK OF ADORING SOCIETY LADIES HE WOULD POINT TO THE PICTURE AND EXPLAIN THOSE GOLDEN OLYMPIAN DAYS WHEN THE ELEUTHERINIAN CULT HAD ORIGINATED THE WORLD HAD CHANGED MUCH SINCE THEN AND FOR THE WORSE
8138-293529-0025 AND YET HE HAD BEEN AWED BY ITS RICHNESS AND BY THE UNDOUBTEDLY EXCLUSIVE CHARACTER OF ITS WORSHIPPERS HE HAD GOT THE IDEA DEFINITELY FIXED IN HIS HEAD THAT THERE REALLY HAD BEEN A MOUNT OLYMPUS AND WHEN HE TRIED TO IMAGINE THE MILLIONAIRES AND THEIR WAYS
8138-293529-0026 IT WAS THESE GODS AND GODDESSES RECLINING ON SILKEN COUCHES AND SIPPING NECTAR THAT CAME TO HIS MIND NOW SINCE PETER HAD COME TO KNOW THE REDS WHO WANTED TO BLOW UP THE PALACES OF THE MILLIONAIRES HE WAS MORE THAN EVER ON THE SIDE OF HIS GODS AND GODDESSES
8138-293529-0027 HIS FERVORS FOR THEM INCREASED EVERY TIME HE HEARD THEM ASSAILED HE WANTED TO MEET SOME OF THEM AND PASSIONATELY YET RESPECTFULLY POUR OUT TO THEM HIS ALLEGIANCE A GLOW OF SATISFACTION CAME OVER HIM AS HE PICTURED HIMSELF IN SOME PALACE LOUNGING UPON A SILKEN CONCH
8138-293529-0028 AND EXPLAINING TO A MILLIONAIRE HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE VALUE OF BEAUTY AND SPLENDOR IN THE WORLD AND NOW HE WAS TO MEET ONE IT WAS TO BE A PART OF HIS JOB TO CULTIVATE ONE TRUE THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS PARTICULAR MILLIONAIRE
8138-293529-0029 PETER HAD MET PARLOR REDS AT THE HOME OF THE TODD SISTERS THE LARGE SHINING LADIES WHO CAME IN LARGE SHINING CARS TO HEAR HIM TELL OF HIS JAIL EXPERIENCES BUT HE HADN'T BEEN SURE AS TO WHETHER THEY WERE REALLY MILLIONAIRES OR NOT
8138-293529-0030 AND SADIE WHEN HE HAD INQUIRED PARTICULARLY HAD ANSWERED VAGUELY THAT EVERY ONE IN THE RADICAL MOVEMENT WHO COULD AFFORD AN AUTOMOBILE OR A DRESS SUIT WAS CALLED A MILLIONAIRE BY THE NEWSPAPERS BUT YOUNG LACKMAN WAS A REAL MILLIONAIRE
8138-293529-0031 MC GIVNEY POSITIVELY ASSURED HIM AND SO PETER WAS FREE TO ADMIRE HIM IN SPITE OF ALL HIS FREAK IDEAS WHICH THE RAT FACED MAN EXPLAINED WITH INTENSE AMUSEMENT YOUNG LACKMAN CONDUCTED A SCHOOL FOR BOYS AND WHEN ONE OF THE BOYS DID WRONG
8138-293529-0032 SURE HE WILL SAID MC GIVNEY THAT'S THE POINT YOU'VE BEEN IN JAIL YOU'VE REALLY DONE SOMETHING AS A PACIFIST WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TO TRY TO INTEREST HIM IN YOUR ANTI CONSCRIPTION LEAGUE TELL HIM YOU WANT TO MAKE IT INTO A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION
8138-293529-0033 THE ADDRESS OF YOUNG LACKMAN WAS THE HOTEL DE SOTO AND AS HE HEARD THIS PETER'S HEART GAVE A LEAP THE HOTEL DE SOTO WAS THE MOUNT OLYMPUS OF AMERICAN CITY
8138-293529-0034 ALL LIFE WAS A GIGANTIC BLUFF AND YOU ENCOURAGED YOURSELF IN YOUR BLUFFING BY THE CERTAINTY THAT EVERYBODY ELSE WAS BLUFFING JUST AS HARD AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THAT EVENING PETER STROLLED UP TO THE MAGIC BRONZE DOORS AND TOUCHED THEM AND SURE ENOUGH
8138-293529-0035 THE BLUE UNIFORMED GUARDIANS DREW THEM BACK WITHOUT A WORD AND THE TINY BRASS BUTTON IMPS NEVER EVEN GLANCED AT PETER AS HE STRODE UP TO THE DESK AND ASKED FOR MISTER LACKMAN
8138-293529-0036 THE HAUGHTY CLERK PASSED HIM ON TO A STILL MORE HAUGHTY TELEPHONE OPERATOR WHO CONDESCENDED TO SPEAK INTO HER TRUMPET AND THEN INFORMED HIM THAT MISTER LACKMAN WAS OUT HE HAD LEFT WORD THAT HE WOULD RETURN AT EIGHT
