5186-7793-0000 ON SATURDAY APRIL ELEVENTH HE APPOINTED ME TO COME TO HIM IN THE EVENING WHEN HE SHOULD BE AT LEISURE TO GIVE ME SOME ASSISTANCE FOR THE DEFENCE OF HASTIE THE SCHOOLMASTER OF CAMPBELLTOWN FOR WHOM I WAS TO APPEAR IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS
5186-7793-0001 TO DICTATE TO ME WHILE I WROTE AS FOLLOWS THE CHARGE IS THAT HE HAS USED IMMODERATE AND CRUEL CORRECTION CORRECTION IN ITSELF IS NOT CRUEL CHILDREN
5186-7793-0002 AND HAS NEVER BEEN THOUGHT INCONSISTENT WITH PARENTAL TENDERNESS IT IS THE DUTY OF A MASTER WHO IS IN HIS HIGHEST EXALTATION WHEN HE IS LOCO PARENTIS YET AS GOOD THINGS BECOME EVIL BY EXCESS
5186-7793-0003 BUT WHEN IS CORRECTION IMMODERATE WHEN IT IS MORE FREQUENT OR MORE SEVERE THAN IS REQUIRED
5186-7793-0004 ET DOCENDUM FOR REFORMATION AND INSTRUCTION NO SEVERITY IS CRUEL WHICH OBSTINACY MAKES NECESSARY FOR THE GREATEST CRUELTY WOULD BE TO DESIST
5186-7793-0005 AND LEAVE THE SCHOLAR TOO CARELESS FOR INSTRUCTION AND TOO MUCH HARDENED FOR REPROOF LOCKE IN HIS TREATISE OF EDUCATION MENTIONS A MOTHER WITH APPLAUSE WHO WHIPPED AN INFANT EIGHT TIMES
5186-7793-0006 BEFORE SHE HAD SUBDUED IT FOR HAD SHE STOPPED AT THE SEVENTH ACT OF CORRECTION HER DAUGHTER SAYS HE
5186-7793-0007 THERE MUST BE EITHER UNBOUNDED LICENCE OR ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY THE MASTER WHO PUNISHES NOT ONLY CONSULTS THE FUTURE HAPPINESS OF HIM WHO IS THE IMMEDIATE SUBJECT OF CORRECTION BUT HE PROPAGATES OBEDIENCE
5186-7793-0008 THROUGH THE WHOLE SCHOOL AND ESTABLISHES REGULARITY BY EXEMPLARY JUSTICE THE VICTORIOUS OBSTINACY OF A SINGLE BOY WOULD MAKE HIS FUTURE ENDEAVOURS OF REFORMATION OR INSTRUCTION
5186-7793-0009 TOTALLY INEFFECTUAL OBSTINACY THEREFORE MUST NEVER BE VICTORIOUS YET IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THERE SOMETIMES OCCURS A SULLEN AND HARDY RESOLUTION
5186-7793-0010 THAT LAUGHS AT ALL COMMON PUNISHMENT AND BIDS DEFIANCE TO ALL COMMON DEGREES OF PAIN CORRECTION MUST BE PROPORTIONED TO OCCASIONS THE FLEXIBLE WILL BE REFORMED BY GENTLE DISCIPLINE
5186-7793-0011 AND THE REFRACTORY MUST BE SUBDUED BY HARSHER METHODS THE DEGREES OF SCHOLASTICK AS OF MILITARY PUNISHMENT NO STATED RULES CAN ASCERTAIN
5186-7793-0012 IT MUST BE ENFORCED TILL IT OVERPOWERS TEMPTATION TILL STUBBORNNESS BECOMES FLEXIBLE AND PERVERSENESS REGULAR CUSTOM AND REASON
5186-7793-0013 SHALL BE CONSIDERED AS CRIMINAL BUT PUNISHMENTS HOWEVER SEVERE THAT PRODUCE NO LASTING EVIL MAY BE JUST AND REASONABLE BECAUSE THEY MAY BE NECESSARY
5186-7793-0014 SUCH HAVE BEEN THE PUNISHMENTS USED BY THE RESPONDENT NO SCHOLAR HAS GONE FROM HIM EITHER BLIND OR LAME OR WITH ANY OF HIS LIMBS OR POWERS INJURED OR IMPAIRED THEY WERE IRREGULAR AND HE PUNISHED THEM
5186-7793-0015 THEY WERE OBSTINATE AND HE ENFORCED HIS PUNISHMENT BUT HOWEVER PROVOKED HE NEVER EXCEEDED THE LIMITS OF MODERATION FOR HE INFLICTED NOTHING BEYOND PRESENT PAIN AND HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS REQUIRED
5186-7793-0016 NO MAN IS SO LITTLE ABLE TO DETERMINE AS THOSE WHO HAVE DETERMINED AGAINST HIM THE PARENTS OF THE OFFENDERS IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT HE USED UNPRECEDENTED AND IMPROPER INSTRUMENTS OF CORRECTION
5186-7793-0017 OF THIS ACCUSATION THE MEANING IS NOT VERY EASY TO BE FOUND NO INSTRUMENT OF CORRECTION IS MORE PROPER THAN ANOTHER BUT AS IT IS BETTER ADAPTED TO PRODUCE PRESENT PAIN
5186-7793-0018 WITHOUT LASTING MISCHIEF WHATEVER WERE HIS INSTRUMENTS NO LASTING MISCHIEF HAS ENSUED AND THEREFORE HOWEVER UNUSUAL IN HANDS SO CAUTIOUS THEY WERE PROPER
5186-7793-0019 IT HAS BEEN OBJECTED THAT THE RESPONDENT ADMITS THE CHARGE OF CRUELTY BY PRODUCING NO EVIDENCE TO CONFUTE IT LET IT BE CONSIDERED THAT HIS SCHOLARS ARE EITHER DISPERSED AT LARGE IN THE WORLD
5186-7793-0020 OR CONTINUE TO INHABIT THE PLACE IN WHICH THEY WERE BRED THOSE WHO ARE DISPERSED CANNOT BE FOUND THOSE WHO REMAIN ARE THE SONS OF HIS PERSECUTORS AND ARE NOT LIKELY TO SUPPORT A MAN TO WHOM THEIR FATHERS ARE ENEMIES
5186-7793-0021 IF IT BE SUPPOSED THAT THE ENMITY OF THEIR FATHERS PROVES THE JUSTICE OF THE CHARGE IT MUST BE CONSIDERED HOW OFTEN EXPERIENCE SHEWS US THAT MEN WHO ARE ANGRY ON ONE GROUND
5186-7793-0022 WILL ACCUSE ON ANOTHER WITH HOW LITTLE KINDNESS IN A TOWN OF LOW TRADE A MAN WHO LIVES BY LEARNING IS REGARDED AND HOW IMPLICITLY WHERE THE INHABITANTS ARE NOT VERY RICH A RICH MAN IS HEARKENED TO
5186-7793-0023 AND FOLLOWED IN A PLACE LIKE CAMPBELLTOWN IT IS EASY FOR ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL INHABITANTS TO MAKE A PARTY IT IS EASY FOR THAT PARTY TO HEAT THEMSELVES WITH IMAGINARY GRIEVANCES IT IS EASY FOR THEM
5186-7793-0024 TO OPPRESS A MAN POORER THAN THEMSELVES AND NATURAL TO ASSERT THE DIGNITY OF RICHES BY PERSISTING IN OPPRESSION THE ARGUMENT WHICH ATTEMPTS TO PROVE THE IMPROPRIETY OF RESTORING HIM TO THE SCHOOL
5186-7793-0025 BY ALLEDGING THAT HE HAS LOST THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE IS NOT THE SUBJECT OF JURIDICAL CONSIDERATION
5186-7793-0026 NOT FOR THEIR JUDGEMENT BUT FOR HIS OWN ACTIONS IT MAY BE CONVENIENT FOR THEM TO HAVE ANOTHER MASTER BUT IT IS A CONVENIENCE OF THEIR OWN MAKING
5186-7793-0027 CONVENIENT FOR HIM TO FIND ANOTHER SCHOOL BUT THIS CONVENIENCE HE CANNOT OBTAIN THE QUESTION IS NOT WHAT IS NOW CONVENIENT BUT WHAT IS GENERALLY RIGHT
5186-7793-0028 BY TYRANNY WHICH LAW HAS DEFEATED AND BY MALICE WHICH VIRTUE HAS SURMOUNTED THIS SIR SAID HE YOU ARE TO TURN IN YOUR MIND AND MAKE THE BEST USE OF IT YOU CAN IN YOUR SPEECH
5186-7793-0029 OF OUR FRIEND GOLDSMITH HE SAID SIR HE IS SO MUCH AFRAID OF BEING UNNOTICED THAT HE OFTEN TALKS MERELY LEST YOU SHOULD FORGET
5186-7793-0030 THAT HE IS IN THE COMPANY BOSWELL YES HE STANDS FORWARD JOHNSON TRUE SIR BUT IF A MAN IS TO STAND FORWARD HE SHOULD WISH TO DO IT NOT IN AN AUKWARD POSTURE NOT IN RAGS
5186-7793-0031 NOT SO AS THAT HE SHALL ONLY BE EXPOSED TO RIDICULE BOSWELL FOR MY PART I LIKE VERY WELL TO HEAR HONEST GOLDSMITH TALK AWAY CARELESSLY JOHNSON WHY YES SIR BUT
5186-7793-0032 NO SIR WHILE LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS A DISTINCTION THE FEW WHO HAVE THAT DISTINCTION
5186-7793-0033 WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER TO FOLLOW NATURE AND GO TO BED AND RISE JUST AS NATURE GIVES US LIGHT OR WITH HOLDS IT JOHNSON NO SIR
5186-7793-0034 THAT SOLEMN SEASON WHICH THE CHRISTIAN WORLD HAS APPROPRIATED TO THE COMMEMORATION OF THE MYSTERIES OF OUR REDEMPTION AND DURING WHICH WHATEVER EMBERS OF RELIGION ARE IN OUR BREASTS WILL BE KINDLED
5186-7793-0035 IN HIS PRIVATE REGISTER MY MIND IS UNSETTLED AND MY MEMORY CONFUSED I HAVE OF LATE TURNED MY THOUGHTS WITH A VERY USELESS EARNESTNESS
5186-7793-0036 WHO COULD KNOW CARDS BY THE TOUCH DOCTOR JOHNSON SAID THE CARDS USED BY SUCH PERSONS MUST BE LESS POLISHED THAN OURS COMMONLY ARE WE TALKED OF SOUNDS
5186-7793-0037 THE GENERAL SAID THERE WAS NO BEAUTY IN A SIMPLE SOUND BUT ONLY IN AN HARMONIOUS COMPOSITION OF SOUNDS I PRESUMED TO DIFFER FROM THIS OPINION AND MENTIONED
5186-7793-0038 THE SOFT AND SWEET SOUND OF A FINE WOMAN'S VOICE JOHNSON NO SIR IF A SERPENT OR A TOAD UTTERED IT
5186-7793-0039 BUT NEITHER WILL DENY THAT EACH IS GOOD IN ITS KIND WHILE I REMAINED IN LONDON THIS SPRING I WAS WITH HIM AT SEVERAL OTHER TIMES BOTH BY HIMSELF AND IN COMPANY I DINED WITH HIM ONE DAY
5186-7793-0040 AT THE CROWN AND ANCHOR TAVERN IN THE STRAND WITH LORD ELIBANK MISTER LANGTON AND DOCTOR VANSITTART OF OXFORD WITHOUT SPECIFYING EACH PARTICULAR DAY I HAVE PRESERVED THE FOLLOWING MEMORABLE THINGS
5186-7793-0041 I REGRETTED THE REFLECTION IN HIS PREFACE TO SHAKSPEARE AGAINST GARRICK TO WHOM
5186-7793-0042 THAT GARRICK WANTED TO BE COURTED FOR THEM AND THAT ON THE CONTRARY GARRICK SHOULD HAVE COURTED HIM AND SENT HIM THE PLAYS OF HIS OWN ACCORD BUT INDEED
5186-7793-0043 FOR THAT REASON JOHNSON YES SIR IF HE SAT NEXT YOU I EXPRESSED A LIKING FOR MISTER FRANCIS OSBORNE'S WORKS AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THAT WRITER
5186-7793-0044 HAS AN AIR OF ORIGINALITY
5186-7793-0045 THERE IS NO PERMANENT NATIONAL CHARACTER IT VARIES ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES ALEXANDER THE GREAT SWEPT INDIA NOW THE TURKS SWEEP GREECE A LEARNED GENTLEMAN WHO IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION
5186-7793-0046 WISHED TO INFORM US OF THIS SIMPLE FACT THAT THE COUNSEL UPON THE CIRCUIT AT SHREWSBURY WERE MUCH BITTEN BY FLEAS TOOK I SUPPOSE SEVEN OR EIGHT MINUTES IN RELATING IT CIRCUMSTANTIALLY HE IN A
5186-7793-0047 THAT BY REASON OF THIS FLEAS NESTLED THERE IN PRODIGIOUS NUMBERS THAT THE LODGINGS OF THE COUNSEL WERE NEAR TO THE TOWN HALL AND THAT THOSE LITTLE ANIMALS MOVED FROM PLACE TO PLACE WITH WONDERFUL AGILITY
5186-7793-0048 AND SO HAS A CAT WHEN SHE CATCHES A MOUSE FOR HER KITTEN BUT SHE CANNOT WRITE LIKE
5186-7793-0049 WHO HAD RESIDED LONG IN SPAIN AND WAS UNWILLING TO RETURN TO BRITAIN JOHNSON SIR
5186-7793-0050 DOES CLIMATE BEAR TO THE COMPLEX SYSTEM OF HUMAN LIFE
5186-7793-0051 ON WHOM I HAPPENED TO CALL IN THE MORNING SAID HE WOULD JOIN US WHICH HE DID AND WE SPENT A VERY AGREEABLE DAY THOUGH I RECOLLECT BUT LITTLE OF WHAT PASSED HE SAID
5186-7793-0052 WALPOLE WAS A MINISTER GIVEN BY THE KING TO THE PEOPLE PITT WAS A MINISTER GIVEN BY THE PEOPLE TO THE KING AS AN ADJUNCT THE MISFORTUNE OF GOLDSMITH IN CONVERSATION IS THIS
5186-7793-0053 HE GOES ON WITHOUT KNOWING HOW HE IS TO GET OFF HIS GENIUS IS GREAT BUT HIS KNOWLEDGE IS SMALL AS THEY SAY OF A GENEROUS MAN IT IS A PITY HE IS NOT RICH WE MAY SAY OF GOLDSMITH
5186-7793-0054 IT IS A PITY HE IS NOT KNOWING HE WOULD NOT KEEP HIS KNOWLEDGE TO HIMSELF BEFORE LEAVING LONDON THIS YEAR I CONSULTED HIM UPON A QUESTION PURELY OF SCOTCH LAW IT WAS HELD OF OLD
5186-7793-0055 AND CONTINUED FOR A LONG PERIOD TO BE AN ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLE IN THAT LAW THAT WHOEVER INTERMEDDLED WITH THE EFFECTS OF A PERSON DECEASED WITHOUT THE INTERPOSITION OF LEGAL AUTHORITY TO GUARD AGAINST EMBEZZLEMENT
5186-7793-0056 SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO PAY ALL THE DEBTS OF THE DECEASED AS HAVING BEEN GUILTY OF WHAT WAS TECHNICALLY CALLED VICIOUS INTROMISSION THE COURT OF SESSION
5186-7793-0057 WHERE THE INTERFERENCE PROVED
5186-7793-0058 AND MAY THEREFORE BE SUSPENDED OR MODIFIED AS THE COURT SHALL THINK PROPER CONCERNING THE POWER OF THE COURT TO MAKE OR TO SUSPEND A LAW WE HAVE NO INTENTION TO INQUIRE IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR OUR PURPOSE THAT
5186-7793-0059 TO GIVE TO ONE MAN WHAT IN THE SAME CASE IS GIVEN TO ANOTHER THE ADVANTAGE WHICH HUMANITY DERIVES FROM LAW IS THIS THAT THE LAW GIVES EVERY MAN A RULE OF ACTION AND
5186-7793-0060 PRESCRIBES A MODE OF CONDUCT WHICH SHALL ENTITLE HIM TO THE SUPPORT AND PROTECTION OF SOCIETY THAT THE LAW MAY BE A RULE OF ACTION IT IS NECESSARY THAT IT BE KNOWN IT IS NECESSARY
5186-7793-0061 THAT IT BE PERMANENT AND STABLE THE LAW IS THE MEASURE OF CIVIL RIGHT BUT IF THE MEASURE BE CHANGEABLE THE EXTENT OF THE THING MEASURED NEVER CAN BE SETTLED
5186-7793-0062 BY WHICH THE DEFICIENCIES OF PRIVATE UNDERSTANDING ARE TO BE SUPPLIED IT IS TO SUFFER THE RASH AND IGNORANT TO ACT AT DISCRETION AND THEN TO DEPEND FOR THE LEGALITY OF THAT ACTION ON THE SENTENCE OF THE JUDGE
5186-7793-0063 HE THAT IS THUS GOVERNED LIVES NOT BY LAW BUT BY OPINION NOT BY A CERTAIN RULE TO WHICH HE CAN APPLY HIS INTENTION BEFORE HE ACTS
5186-7793-0064 WHICH HE CAN NEVER KNOW BUT AFTER HE HAS COMMITTED THE ACT ON WHICH THAT OPINION SHALL BE PASSED HE LIVES BY A LAW IF A LAW IT BE
5186-7793-0065 THAT THERE MAY BE INTROMISSION WITHOUT FRAUD WHICH HOWEVER TRUE WILL BY NO MEANS JUSTIFY AN OCCASIONAL AND ARBITRARY RELAXATION OF THE LAW THE END
5186-7793-0066 OF LAW IS PROTECTION AS WELL AS VENGEANCE INDEED VENGEANCE IS NEVER USED BUT TO STRENGTHEN PROTECTION THAT SOCIETY ONLY IS WELL GOVERNED WHERE LIFE IS FREED FROM DANGER AND FROM SUSPICION
5186-7793-0067 WHERE POSSESSION IS SO SHELTERED BY SALUTARY PROHIBITIONS THAT VIOLATION IS PREVENTED MORE FREQUENTLY THAN PUNISHED SUCH A PROHIBITION WAS THIS WHILE IT OPERATED WITH ITS ORIGINAL FORCE
5186-7793-0068 THE CREDITOR OF THE DECEASED WAS NOT ONLY WITHOUT LOSS BUT WITHOUT FEAR HE WAS NOT TO SEEK A REMEDY FOR AN INJURY SUFFERED FOR INJURY WAS WARDED OFF
5186-7793-0069 AS THE LAW HAS BEEN SOMETIMES ADMINISTERED IT LAYS US OPEN TO WOUNDS BECAUSE IT IS IMAGINED TO HAVE THE POWER OF HEALING TO PUNISH FRAUD WHEN IT IS DETECTED
5186-7793-0070 IS THE PROPER ACT OF VINDICTIVE JUSTICE BUT TO PREVENT FRAUDS AND MAKE PUNISHMENT UNNECESSARY IS THE GREAT EMPLOYMENT OF LEGISLATIVE WISDOM TO PERMIT INTROMISSION
5186-7793-0071 ADVENTITIOUS STRENGTH IT LIKEWISE ENLIGHTENS THE IGNORANT WITH EXTRINSICK UNDERSTANDING LAW TEACHES US TO KNOW WHEN WE COMMIT INJURY AND WHEN WE SUFFER IT
5186-7793-0072 IT FIXES CERTAIN MARKS UPON ACTIONS BY WHICH WE ARE ADMONISHED TO DO OR TO FORBEAR THEM
5186-7793-0073 SAYS ONE OF THE FATHERS NUNQUAM
5186-7793-0074 HE WHO NEVER INTROMITS AT ALL WILL NEVER INTROMIT
5186-7793-0075 BEFORE THE FEROCITY OF THE INHABITANTS OF THIS PART OF THE ISLAND WAS SUBDUED THE UTMOST SEVERITY OF THE CIVIL LAW WAS NECESSARY TO RESTRAIN INDIVIDUALS FROM PLUNDERING EACH OTHER THUS THE MAN WHO INTERMEDDLED
5186-7793-0076 IRREGULARLY WITH THE MOVEABLES OF A PERSON DECEASED WAS SUBJECTED TO ALL THE DEBTS OF THE DECEASED WITHOUT LIMITATION THIS MAKES A BRANCH OF THE LAW OF SCOTLAND KNOWN BY THE NAME OF VICIOUS INTROMISSION
5186-7793-0077 WHICH PROVED IN MANY INSTANCES A MOST RIGOROUS PUNISHMENT
5186-7793-0078 IT IS EXTREMELY REMARKABLE THAT IN PROPORTION TO OUR IMPROVEMENT IN MANNERS THIS REGULATION HAS BEEN GRADUALLY SOFTENED AND APPLIED BY OUR SOVEREIGN COURT WITH A SPARING HAND
5186-7793-0079 I FIND MYSELF UNDER A NECESSITY OF OBSERVING THAT THIS LEARNED AND JUDICIOUS WRITER
5186-7793-0080 HAS NOT ACCURATELY DISTINGUISHED THE DEFICIENCIES AND DEMANDS OF THE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OF HUMAN LIFE WHICH FROM A DEGREE OF SAVAGENESS AND INDEPENDENCE IN WHICH ALL LAWS ARE VAIN PASSES OR MAY PASS
5186-7793-0081 BY INNUMERABLE GRADATIONS TO A STATE OF RECIPROCAL BENIGNITY IN WHICH LAWS SHALL BE NO LONGER NECESSARY
5186-7793-0082 LIVING EACH MAN TO HIMSELF TAKING FROM THE WEAK AND LOSING TO THE STRONG IN THEIR FIRST COALITIONS OF SOCIETY
5186-7793-0083 OF GENERAL HAPPINESS THE PRODUCT OF GENERAL CONFIDENCE THERE IS YET NO THOUGHT MEN CONTINUE TO PROSECUTE THEIR OWN ADVANTAGES BY THE NEAREST WAY AND THE UTMOST SEVERITY OF THE CIVIL LAW IS NECESSARY
5186-7793-0084 TO RESTRAIN INDIVIDUALS FROM PLUNDERING EACH OTHER
5186-7793-0085 FROM ACTS OF PUBLICK VIOLENCE
5186-7793-0086 UNDISGUISED OPPRESSION THE FEROCITY OF OUR ANCESTORS AS OF ALL OTHER NATIONS PRODUCED NOT FRAUD
5186-7793-0087 THEY HAD NOT YET LEARNED TO CHEAT AND ATTEMPTED ONLY TO ROB AS MANNERS GROW MORE POLISHED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD MEN ATTAIN LIKEWISE DEXTERITY IN EVIL
5186-7793-0088 THOSE WHO BEFORE INVADED PASTURES AND STORMED HOUSES NOW BEGIN TO ENRICH THEMSELVES BY UNEQUAL CONTRACTS AND FRAUDULENT INTROMISSIONS
5186-7793-0089 IT IS NOT AGAINST THE VIOLENCE OF FEROCITY BUT THE CIRCUMVENTIONS OF DECEIT THAT THIS LAW WAS FRAMED AND I AM AFRAID THE INCREASE OF COMMERCE AND THE INCESSANT STRUGGLE FOR RICHES WHICH COMMERCE EXCITES
5186-7793-0090 GIVE US NO PROSPECT OF AN END SPEEDILY TO BE EXPECTED OF ARTIFICE AND FRAUD IT THEREFORE SEEMS TO BE NO VERY CONCLUSIVE REASONING WHICH CONNECTS THOSE TWO PROPOSITIONS
5186-7793-0091 IT WAS NOT THAT THE NATION WAS GROWN LESS FIERCE AND I AM AFRAID IT CANNOT BE AFFIRMED THAT IT IS GROWN LESS FRAUDULENT
5186-7793-0092 SINCE THIS LAW HAS BEEN REPRESENTED AS RIGOROUSLY AND UNREASONABLY PENAL IT SEEMS NOT IMPROPER TO CONSIDER WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS AND QUALITIES THAT MAKE THE JUSTICE OR PROPRIETY OF A PENAL LAW
5186-7793-0093 TWO CONDITIONS ARE NECESSARY AND TWO PROPER IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE LAW SHOULD BE ADEQUATE TO ITS END THAT IF IT BE OBSERVED IT SHALL PREVENT THE EVIL AGAINST WHICH IT IS DIRECTED
5186-7793-0094 IT IS SECONDLY NECESSARY THAT THE END OF THE LAW BE OF SUCH IMPORTANCE AS TO DESERVE THE SECURITY OF A PENAL SANCTION THE OTHER CONDITIONS OF A PENAL LAW WHICH THOUGH NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
5186-7793-0095 ARE TO A VERY HIGH DEGREE FIT ARE THAT TO THE MORAL VIOLATION OF THE LAW THERE ARE MANY TEMPTATIONS AND THAT OF THE PHYSICAL OBSERVANCE THERE IS GREAT FACILITY
5186-7793-0096 ALL THESE CONDITIONS APPARENTLY CONCUR TO JUSTIFY THE LAW WHICH WE ARE NOW CONSIDERING ITS END IS THE SECURITY OF PROPERTY AND PROPERTY VERY OFTEN OF GREAT VALUE
5186-7793-0097 THE METHOD BY WHICH IT EFFECTS THE SECURITY IS EFFICACIOUS BECAUSE IT ADMITS IN ITS ORIGINAL RIGOUR NO GRADATIONS OF INJURY BUT KEEPS GUILT AND INNOCENCE APART BY A DISTINCT AND DEFINITE LIMITATION
5186-7793-0098 HE THAT INTROMITS IS CRIMINAL HE THAT INTROMITS NOT IS INNOCENT OF THE TWO SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT BOTH ARE IN OUR FAVOUR THE TEMPTATION TO INTROMIT IS FREQUENT AND STRONG
5186-7793-0099 SO STRONG AND SO FREQUENT AS TO REQUIRE THE UTMOST ACTIVITY OF JUSTICE AND VIGILANCE OF CAUTION TO WITHSTAND ITS PREVALENCE AND THE METHOD BY WHICH A MAN MAY ENTITLE HIMSELF TO LEGAL INTROMISSION IS SO OPEN
5186-7793-0100 FOR WHY SHOULD A MAN OMIT TO DO BUT FOR REASONS WHICH HE WILL NOT CONFESS THAT WHICH HE CAN DO SO EASILY AND THAT WHICH HE KNOWS TO BE REQUIRED BY THE LAW IF TEMPTATION WERE RARE
5186-7793-0101 A PENAL LAW MIGHT BE DEEMED UNNECESSARY IF THE DUTY ENJOINED BY THE LAW WERE OF DIFFICULT PERFORMANCE OMISSION THOUGH IT COULD NOT BE JUSTIFIED MIGHT BE PITIED BUT IN THE PRESENT CASE
5186-7793-0102 NEITHER EQUITY NOR COMPASSION OPERATE AGAINST IT A USEFUL A NECESSARY LAW IS BROKEN
5186-7793-0103 AND FACILITY I THEREFORE RETURN TO MY ORIGINAL POSITION THAT A LAW TO HAVE ITS EFFECT MUST BE PERMANENT AND STABLE IT MAY BE SAID IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE SCHOOLS
5186-7793-0104 WE MAY HAVE A LAW OR WE MAY HAVE NO LAW BUT WE CANNOT HAVE HALF A LAW WE MUST EITHER HAVE A RULE OF ACTION OR BE PERMITTED TO ACT BY DISCRETION AND BY CHANCE
5186-7793-0105 DEVIATIONS FROM THE LAW MUST BE UNIFORMLY PUNISHED OR NO MAN CAN BE CERTAIN WHEN HE SHALL BE SAFE THAT FROM THE RIGOUR OF THE ORIGINAL INSTITUTION THIS COURT
5186-7793-0106 HAS SOMETIMES DEPARTED CANNOT BE DENIED BUT AS IT IS EVIDENT THAT SUCH DEVIATIONS AS THEY MAKE LAW UNCERTAIN
5186-7793-0107 WITH SUCH COMPREHENSION OF MIND AND SUCH CLEARNESS OF PENETRATION DID HE THUS TREAT A SUBJECT ALTOGETHER NEW TO HIM WITHOUT ANY OTHER PREPARATION THAN MY
5186-7793-0108 ONE OF THAT HONOURABLE BODY HAD CRITICAL SAGACITY ENOUGH TO DISCOVER A MORE THAN ORDINARY HAND IN THE PETITION I TOLD HIM DOCTOR JOHNSON
5186-7793-0109 MY DEAR SIR GIVE YOURSELF NO TROUBLE IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE PAPERS YOU PRESENT TO US
5186-7793-0110 Q DEAR SIR THE REGRET HAS NOT BEEN LITTLE WITH WHICH I HAVE MISSED A JOURNEY SO PREGNANT WITH PLEASING EXPECTATIONS AS THAT IN WHICH I COULD PROMISE MYSELF NOT ONLY THE GRATIFICATION OF CURIOSITY BOTH RATIONAL AND FANCIFUL
5186-7793-0111 BUT SUCH HAS BEEN THE COURSE OF THINGS THAT I COULD NOT COME AND SUCH HAS BEEN I AM AFRAID THE STATE OF MY BODY THAT IT WOULD NOT WELL HAVE SECONDED MY INCLINATION MY BODY I THINK GROWS BETTER
5186-7793-0112 EVERY DAY MORE LIKED AT LEAST I LIKE IT MORE AS I LOOK MORE UPON IT I AM GLAD IF YOU GOT CREDIT BY YOUR CAUSE AND AM YET OF OPINION THAT OUR CAUSE WAS GOOD
5186-7793-0113 HAD BUT HIS DESERTS YOU PROMISED TO GET ME A LITTLE PINDAR
5186-7793-0114 THE LEISURE WHICH I CANNOT ENJOY IT WILL BE A PLEASURE TO HEAR THAT YOU EMPLOY UPON THE ANTIQUITIES OF THE FEUDAL ESTABLISHMENT THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF ANCIENT TENURES IS GRADUALLY PASSING AWAY
5186-7793-0115 WHO STUDIES THE LAWS OF HIS COUNTRY AND OF A GENTLEMAN WHO MAY NATURALLY BE CURIOUS TO KNOW THE CONDITION OF HIS OWN ANCESTORS I AM DEAR SIR YOURS WITH GREAT AFFECTION SAM JOHNSON
5186-7793-0116 MY DEAR SIR EDINBURGH DECEMBER TWENTY FIFTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO I WAS MUCH DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU DID NOT COME TO SCOTLAND LAST AUTUMN HOWEVER I MUST OWN THAT YOUR LETTER PREVENTS ME FROM COMPLAINING
5186-7793-0117 WHICH WE HAVE SO LONG PROPOSED I COMMUNICATED TO BEATTIE WHAT YOU SAID OF HIS BOOK IN YOUR LAST LETTER TO ME HE WRITES TO ME THUS YOU JUDGE VERY RIGHTLY IN SUPPOSING
5186-7793-0118 THAT DOCTOR JOHNSON'S FAVOURABLE OPINION OF ANY BOOK MUST GIVE ME GREAT DELIGHT INDEED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY HOW MUCH I AM GRATIFIED BY IT
