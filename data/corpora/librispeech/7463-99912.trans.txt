7463-99912-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN MISS VALE DEPARTS SUDDENLY FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS A SILENCE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN THEN ASHTON KIRK SAID DRYLY
7463-99912-0001 MISS VALE HAS APPARENTLY NOT BEEN ALTOGETHER FRANK WITH US IN THIS MATTER YOU THINK THEN BEGAN PENDLETON IN A VOICE OF TERROR BUT ASHTON KIRK STOPPED HIM
7463-99912-0002 I THINK MANY THINGS SAID HE BUT THEY ARE NEITHER HERE NOR THERE FACTS ARE WHAT COUNT PUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES TOGETHER FOR YOURSELF AND SEE WHERE THEY LEAD YOU
7463-99912-0003 QUIETLY ENGAGED WITH A MAN WHOM I HAVE CONVINCED MYSELF IS ONE OF HUME'S MURDERERS THERE WAS ANOTHER PAUSE THIS TIME IT WAS PENDLETON WHO BROKE THE SILENCE AS YOU SAY
7463-99912-0004 SPOKE HE IN A STRANGE THROATY SORT OF TONE SHE HAS NOT BEEN QUITE FRANK TAKE ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES TOGETHER AND THEY SEEM TO POINT HE PAUSED AS THOUGH QUITE UNABLE TO FINISH
7463-99912-0005 ASHTON KIRK LAID A HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER IMAGINATION IS A THING THAT IS VITALLY NECESSARY IN THIS SORT OF WORK SAID HE BUT IT MUST BE HELD IN CHECK BY REASON
7463-99912-0006 THEN HE ALLOWS HIS IMAGINATION TO TAKE A LONG LEAP TOWARD A RESULT THE UPSHOT IS THAT HIS RESULTS HAVE SELDOM ANYTHING TO SUPPORT THEM THE CORRECT METHOD I THINK IS TO ALLOW THE IMAGINATION TO SCURRY AHEAD
7463-99912-0007 IN THE WAY THAT IS NATURAL TO IT BUT REASON MUST FOLLOW CLOSE BEHIND PROVING EACH STEP OF THE WAY TO BE SURE YOU MAY HAVE THEORIES HYPOTHESES IDEAS WITHOUT END BUT YOU MUST NEVER TAKE THEM FOR GRANTED
7463-99912-0008 SELECT EACH IN ITS TURN PLACE IT IN A TUBE AS THE CHEMIST DOES ADD A FEW DROPS OF REASON AND YOU MAY PRODUCE A FACT IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GO ABOUT IT
7463-99912-0009 ONCE A MAN BECOMES FIXED IN A BELIEF BE THERE EVER SO LITTLE FOUNDATION FOR IT HIS MIND STOPS REVOLVING THE SUBJECT FURTHER PROCEDURE IS HOPELESS I UNDERSTAND ALL THAT WELL ENOUGH
7463-99912-0010 SAID PENDLETON BUT AND HE WAVED HIS HAND TOWARD THE HOUSE WHAT DOES THIS MEAN I DON'T KNOW SAID ASHTON KIRK AND NEITHER DO YOU SO THAT BEING THE CASE
7463-99912-0011 THERE IS BUT ONE THING TO DO FIND OUT THEY GAZED TOWARD THE WINDOW ONCE MORE MISS VALE HAD APPARENTLY MASTERED THE CONTENTS OF THE PAPER AND WAS NOW ENGAGED IN WRITING RAPIDLY
7463-99912-0012 AS THE YOUNG MEN WATCHED SHE STOPPED READ CAREFULLY WHAT SHE HAD WRITTEN AND THEN HANDED IT TO LOCKE THE MUTE CARRIED THE PAPER TO THE LIGHT AND HOLDING IT VERY NEAR TO HIS EYES READ IT WITH MUCH ATTENTION
7463-99912-0013 PLACED IT UPON THE RED COALS OF A STOVE WHICH STOOD NEAR HIM AND WATCHED IT BURN FACING MISS VALE HIS FINGERS BEGAN TO FLY RAPIDLY IN INTRICATE SIGNS THIS ONLY LASTED A MOMENT HOWEVER FOR HE STOPPED
7463-99912-0014 GESTURED PASSIONATELY SEIZED A PAD OF PAPER AND BEGAN TO WRITE WHILE HE WAS THUS ENGAGED ASHTON KIRK SAID TO PENDLETON IN A LOW TONE REMAIN HERE FOR A MOMENT THEN
7463-99912-0015 SLOWLY CAREFULLY THE INVESTIGATOR MADE HIS WAY TOWARD THE WINDOW THROUGH WHICH MISS VALE AND LOCKE WERE TO BE SEEN HEAVY BEAMS OF LIGHT SHOT ACROSS THE GROUND FROM THE WINDOWS
7463-99912-0016 BUT HERE AND THERE WERE TRAILS OF SHADOW HE CLUNG TO THESE UNTIL HE HAD REACHED THE SHELTER OF THE WALLS THEN TO PENDLETON'S AMAZEMENT HE STEPPED DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW THROUGH WHICH THE TWO WERE TO BE SEEN
7463-99912-0017 AND ALSO HE HEARD THE CRY THAT SHE UTTERED MUFFLED BY THE CONFINES OF THE ROOM BUT FULL OF FEAR THEN THE ROOM WAS PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS
7463-99912-0018 THE SOUND OF QUICK MOVING FEET CAME TO HIM THERE FOLLOWED THE PULSATIONS OF A MOTOR AND THE RACING OF A CAR AWAY INTO THE NIGHT SHE'S OFF BREATHED THE YOUNG MAN
7463-99912-0019 AND THERE WAS UNDOUBTED RELIEF IN THE KNOWLEDGE SHE'S OFF AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT KIRK WAS AFTER HE WALKED TOWARD THE HOUSE AND FOUND HIS FRIEND STANDING IN THE SHADOWS WELL CHUCKLED THE INVESTIGATOR
7463-99912-0020 IT DID NOT TAKE HER LONG TO MAKE UP HER MIND EH YOU HAD SOME MOTIVE IN DOING THAT ACCUSED PENDLETON WHAT WAS IT ASHTON KIRK WAS ABOUT TO REPLY
7463-99912-0021 BUT JUST THEN THE SMALL FIGURE OF LOCKE MADE ITS APPEARANCE HE CARRIED A LANTERN AND WAS APPROACHING WITH STUMBLING STEPS HIS EYES PEERING AND BLINKING IN THEIR EFFORTS TO PIERCE THE GLOOM NOT UNTIL HE WAS WELL UPON THE TWO DID HE MAKE THEM OUT
7463-99912-0022 THEN HE HALTED LIFTED THE LIGHT ABOVE HIS HEAD AND SURVEYED THEM INTENTLY IN THE RAYS OF THE LANTERN ASHTON KIRK SMILED URBANELY AND BOWED
7463-99912-0023 EACH OF THEM FORMS ITSELF INTO A WILD NOTE OF INTERROGATION SAID PENDLETON THEY ARE FAIRLY SCREAMING QUESTIONS AT YOU ASHTON KIRK SMILED EVEN MORE AGREEABLY AT LOCKE AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
7463-99912-0024 THEN HE WENT THROUGH THE PANTOMIME OF ONE WRITING AND FINISHED BY POINTING TO THE HOUSE CAREFULLY EAGERLY FEARFULLY THE MUTE EXAMINED THEM
7463-99912-0025 HIS NEAR SIGHTED EYES AND THE WAVERING LIGHT MUST HAVE MADE IT ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE THEM OUT HOWEVER HE AT LENGTH MOTIONED FOR THEM TO FOLLOW HIM AND STARTED BACK BY THE WAY WHICH HE HAD COME
7463-99912-0026 BUT AFTER A FEW STEPS HE HALTED HE INDICATED THAT THEY WERE TO REMAIN WHERE THEY WERE THEN HE WENT TO THE SHED LIKE BUILDING CLOSED THE DOOR AND LOCKED IT PLACING THE KEY IN HIS POCKET
7463-99912-0027 IT WOULD SEEM OBSERVED ASHTON KIRK THAT WE ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED IMPLICITLY ALSO REPLIED PENDLETON THAT THERE IS SOMETHING OF VALUE IN THE SHED
7463-99912-0028 RETURNING LOCKE LED THE WAY TO A DOOR UPON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE SHOWING THEM INTO A SMALL ROOM FURNISHED WITH BOOKS AND SCIENTIFIC APPARATUS AND EVIDENTLY A STUDY
7463-99912-0029 HE SET DOWN THE LANTERN AND WITH A SIGN BADE THEM BE SEATED UPON THEIR DOING SO HE PRODUCED A SMALL PAD OF PAPER AND A PENCIL HANDING THESE TO ASHTON KIRK HE STOOD PEERING AT THEM EXPECTANTLY
7463-99912-0030 WITH THE SWIFT ACCURATE TOUCH OF AN EXPERT THE INVESTIGATOR WROTE IN THE PITMAN SHORTHAND WE ASK PARDON IF WE HAVE STARTLED YOU THEN HE TORE OFF THE SHEET AND HANDED IT TO PROFESSOR LOCKE
7463-99912-0031 THE MAN SEEMED SURPRISED AT THE MEDIUM SELECTED BY HIS VISITOR NEVERTHELESS HE QUICKLY TRACED THE FOLLOWING IN THE SAME CHARACTERS WHO ARE YOU WHAT IS YOUR ERRAND WE WERE SENT TO YOU BY DOCTOR MERCER
7463-99912-0032 REPLIED ASHTON KIRK WITH FLYING PENCIL OUR BUSINESS IS TO SECURE THE ADMISSION OF A NEW PUPIL LOCKE READ THIS AND REGARDED THEM FOR A MOMENT DOUBTFULLY WHY DID YOU NOT PRESS THE BUTTON AT THE DOOR
7463-99912-0033 HE DEMANDED IN WRITING I HARDLY EXPECTED YOU TO HAVE SUCH A THING AS A BELL ANSWERED ASHTON KIRK ON THE PAD AND SO SEEING YOU I ATTRACTED YOUR ATTENTION AS BEST I COULD
7463-99912-0034 PROFESSOR LOCKE READ THIS AND STOOD WITH HIS PENCIL POISED WHEN THE BUZZER SOUNDED HARSHLY HE WENT AT ONCE INTO THE HALL THEY HEARD HIM OPEN THE DOOR AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE RETURNED
7463-99912-0035 FOLLOWED BY HAINES THE FINGERS OF THE TWO FLASHED THEIR SIGNALS BACK AND FORTH THEN A LOOK OF RELIEF CAME INTO LOCKE'S FACE HE EVEN SMILED AND NODDED UNDERSTANDINGLY AT THE TWO YOUNG MEN
7463-99912-0036 I BEG PARDON GENTLEMEN SAID HAINES BUT WHEN I GOT BACK TO THE HALL DOCTOR MERCER MADE ME RETURN AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAD GOT TO SEE THE PROFESSOR THANKS REPLIED THE INVESTIGATOR WE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST DIFFICULTY
7463-99912-0037 SAID THE MAN GOOD NIGHT TO YOU HE FLASHED THE SAME WISH TO THE MUTE WHO ANSWERED READILY THEN HE WENT OUT AND THROUGH THE WINDOW THEY SAW HIS LIGHT AGAIN GO BOBBING AWAY IN THE DARKNESS
7463-99912-0038 THEN THE PROFESSOR BEGAN TO WRITE ONCE MORE I BEG YOUR PARDON WAS HIS MESSAGE IN LONG HAND THE MAN TELLS ME THAT IT WAS QUITE AS YOU SAY BUT I MUST CONFESS I WAS A TRIFLE STARTLED
7463-99912-0039 THE LADY WROTE ASHTON KIRK SEEMED STARTLED TOO FOR THE FRACTION OF A MOMENT THE MUTE HALTED IN HIS REPLY THEN THE PENCIL WITH MUCH ASSURANCE FORMED THE FOLLOWING
7463-99912-0040 IT WAS MY NIECE SHE WAS ABOUT TO GO JUST AS YOU CAME SO DO NOT REPROACH YOURSELF FOR HAVING DRIVEN HER AWAY FOR SOME TIME THE PENCILED CONVERSATION CONTINUED BETWEEN THE TWO
7463-99912-0041 BUT AS IT WAS ALL BASED UPON THE FANCIFUL PUPIL WHOM THE INVESTIGATOR STATED HE DESIRED TO PLACE IN DOCTOR MERCER'S CARE PENDLETON PAID LITTLE HEED TO IT AT LAST HOWEVER THEY BID THE PROFESSOR GOOD BY AND LEFT HIM UPON THE THRESHOLD
7463-99912-0042 HIS FRAIL LITTLE BODY SHARPLY OUTLINED BY THE GLOW FROM THE HALL THE TWO HAD REACHED THEIR OWN CAR AROUND ON THE OTHER ROAD BEFORE PENDLETON SPOKE THEN HE INQUIRED WELL
7463-99912-0043 IF IT SUCCEEDS I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS IF IT DOES NOT I'LL SAY NOTHING AND IT WILL GO UPON THE SCRAP HEAP DEVOTED TO BROKEN FANCIES AND NOW DIXON TO THE CHAUFFEUR
