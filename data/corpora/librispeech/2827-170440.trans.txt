2827-170440-0000 WHAT FLAG IS THIS YOU CARRY ALONG THE SEA AND SHORE THE SAME OUR GRANDSIRES LIFTED UP THE SAME OUR FATHERS BORE IN MANY A BATTLE'S TEMPEST IT SHED THE CRIMSON RAIN
2827-170440-0001 WHAT GOD HAS WOVEN IN HIS LOOM LET NO MAN REND IN TWAIN TO CANAAN TO CANAAN THE LORD HAS LED US FORTH TO PLANT UPON THE REBEL TOWERS THE BANNERS OF THE NORTH HOLMES
2827-170440-0002 ON JANUARY TWENTY NINTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE GENERAL GRANT TOOK COMMAND OF THE ARMY INTENDED TO OPERATE AGAINST VICKSBURG THE LAST PLACE HELD BY THE REBELS ON THE MISSISSIPPI
2827-170440-0003 AND THE ONLY POINT AT WHICH THEY COULD CROSS THE RIVER AND KEEP UP COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR ARMIES AND TERRITORY IN THE SOUTHWEST IT WAS THE FIRST HIGH GROUND BELOW MEMPHIS WAS VERY STRONGLY FORTIFIED AND WAS HELD BY A LARGE ARMY UNDER GENERAL PEMBERTON
2827-170440-0004 THE COMPLETE POSSESSION OF THE MISSISSIPPI WAS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THE CONTROL OF THAT GREAT RIVER WOULD CUT THE CONFEDERACY IN TWO AND DO MORE PROBABLY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
2827-170440-0005 TO MAKE THE OVERTHROW OF THE REBELLION BOTH SPEEDY AND CERTAIN THE NATURAL WAY TO INVEST AND CAPTURE SO STRONG A PLACE DEFENDED AND FORTIFIED AS VICKSBURG WAS WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THE AXIOMS OF THE ART OF WAR HAD BEEN ADHERED TO
2827-170440-0006 BY A SYSTEM OF GRADUAL APPROACHES A STRONG BASE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AT MEMPHIS AND THEN THE ARMY AND THE FLEET MOVED GRADUALLY FORWARD BUILDING STOREHOUSES AND TAKING STRONG POSITIONS AS THEY WENT
2827-170440-0007 TO DO THIS HOWEVER IT FIRST WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY TO WITHDRAW THE ARMY FROM THE POSITIONS IT THEN HELD NOT FAR ABOVE VICKSBURG ON THE WESTERN BANK OF THE RIVER BUT SUCH A MOVEMENT AT THAT TIME WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNDERSTOOD BY THE COUNTRY
2827-170440-0008 AND WOULD HAVE HAD A DISCOURAGING EFFECT ON THE PUBLIC MIND WHICH IT WAS MOST ESSENTIAL TO AVOID THE ELECTIONS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO HAD GONE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND THERE WAS GREAT DISCOURAGEMENT THROUGHOUT THE NORTH
2827-170440-0009 VOLUNTARY ENLISTMENTS HAD FALLEN OFF A DRAFT HAD BEEN ORDERED AND THE PEACE PARTY WAS APPARENTLY GAINING RAPIDLY IN STRENGTH GENERAL GRANT LOOKING AT THIS GRAVE POLITICAL SITUATION WITH THE EYE OF A STATESMAN DECIDED AS A SOLDIER
2827-170440-0010 THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HE WITHDRAW THE ARMY BUT THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED HE WOULD PRESS FORWARD TO A DECISIVE VICTORY IN THIS DETERMINATION HE NEVER FALTERED BUT DROVE STRAIGHT AT HIS OBJECT UNTIL FIVE MONTHS LATER
2827-170440-0011 THE GREAT MISSISSIPPI STRONGHOLD FELL BEFORE HIM EFFORTS WERE MADE THROUGH THE WINTER TO REACH VICKSBURG FROM THE NORTH BY CUTTING CANALS AND BY ATTEMPTS TO GET IN THROUGH THE BAYOUS AND TRIBUTARY STREAMS OF THE GREAT RIVER
2827-170440-0012 ALL THESE EXPEDIENTS FAILED HOWEVER ONE AFTER ANOTHER AS GRANT FROM THE BEGINNING HAD FEARED THAT THEY WOULD HE THEREFORE TOOK ANOTHER AND WIDELY DIFFERENT LINE
2827-170440-0013 AND DETERMINED TO CROSS THE RIVER FROM THE WESTERN TO THE EASTERN BANK BELOW VICKSBURG TO THE SOUTH WITH THE AID OF THE FLEET WHICH RAN THE BATTERIES SUCCESSFULLY HE MOVED HIS ARMY DOWN THE WEST BANK UNTIL HE REACHED A POINT BEYOND THE POSSIBILITY OF ATTACK
2827-170440-0014 WHILE A DIVERSION BY SHERMAN AT HAINES BLUFF ABOVE VICKSBURG KEPT PEMBERTON IN HIS FORTIFICATIONS ON APRIL TWENTY SIXTH GRANT BEGAN TO MOVE HIS MEN OVER THE RIVER AND LANDED THEM AT BRUINSBURG WHEN THIS WAS EFFECTED HE WRITES
2827-170440-0015 I FELT A DEGREE OF RELIEF SCARCELY EVER EQUALED SINCE VICKSBURG WAS NOT YET TAKEN IT IS TRUE NOR WERE ITS DEFENDERS DEMORALIZED BY ANY OF OUR PREVIOUS MOVEMENTS I WAS NOW IN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY
2827-170440-0016 WITH A VAST RIVER AND THE STRONGHOLD OF VICKSBURG BETWEEN ME AND MY BASE OF SUPPLIES BUT I WAS ON DRY GROUND ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE RIVER WITH THE ENEMY
2827-170440-0017 THE SITUATION WAS THIS THE ENEMY HAD ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND MEN AT VICKSBURG HAINES BLUFF AND AT JACKSON MISSISSIPPI ABOUT FIFTY MILES EAST OF VICKSBURG GRANT WHEN HE STARTED HAD ABOUT THIRTY THREE THOUSAND MEN
2827-170440-0018 IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS THAT GRANT WITH INFERIOR NUMBERS SHOULD SUCCEED IN DESTROYING THE SMALLER FORCES TO THE EASTWARD AND THUS PREVENT THEIR UNION WITH PEMBERTON AND THE MAIN ARMY AT VICKSBURG HIS PLAN IN BRIEF
2827-170440-0019 WAS TO FIGHT AND DEFEAT A SUPERIOR ENEMY SEPARATELY AND IN DETAIL HE LOST NO TIME IN PUTTING HIS PLAN INTO ACTION AND PRESSING FORWARD QUICKLY MET A DETACHMENT OF THE ENEMY AT PORT GIBSON AND DEFEATED THEM
2827-170440-0020 THENCE HE MARCHED TO GRAND GULF ON THE MISSISSIPPI WHICH HE TOOK AND WHICH HE HAD PLANNED TO MAKE A BASE OF SUPPLY WHEN HE REACHED GRAND GULF HOWEVER HE FOUND THAT HE WOULD BE OBLIGED TO WAIT A MONTH
2827-170440-0021 IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE REINFORCEMENTS WHICH HE EXPECTED FROM GENERAL BANKS AT PORT HUDSON HE THEREFORE GAVE UP THE IDEA OF MAKING GRAND GULF A BASE AND SHERMAN HAVING NOW JOINED HIM WITH HIS CORPS GRANT STRUCK AT ONCE INTO THE INTERIOR
2827-170440-0022 HE TOOK NOTHING WITH HIM EXCEPT AMMUNITION AND HIS ARMY WAS IN THE LIGHTEST MARCHING ORDER THIS ENABLED HIM TO MOVE WITH GREAT RAPIDITY BUT DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS WAGON TRAINS AND OF ALL MUNITIONS OF WAR EXCEPT CARTRIDGES
2827-170440-0023 EVERYTHING HOWEVER IN THIS CAMPAIGN DEPENDED ON QUICKNESS AND GRANT'S DECISION AS WELL AS ALL HIS MOVEMENTS MARKED THE GENIUS OF THE GREAT SOLDIER WHICH CONSISTS VERY LARGELY IN KNOWING JUST WHEN TO ABANDON THE ACCEPTED MILITARY AXIOMS
2827-170440-0024 PRESSING FORWARD GRANT MET THE ENEMY NUMBERING BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT THOUSAND AT RAYMOND AND READILY DEFEATED THEM HE THEN MARCHED ON TOWARD JACKSON FIGHTING ANOTHER ACTION AT CLINTON
2827-170440-0025 AND AT JACKSON HE STRUCK GENERAL JOSEPH JOHNSTON WHO HAD ARRIVED AT THAT POINT TO TAKE COMMAND OF ALL THE REBEL FORCES JOHNSTON HAD WITH HIM AT THE MOMENT ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND MEN AND STOOD HIS GROUND
2827-170440-0026 THERE WAS A SHARP FIGHT BUT GRANT EASILY DEFEATED THE ENEMY AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE TOWN THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT POINT FOR JACKSON WAS THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI AND WAS A BASE OF MILITARY SUPPLIES
2827-170440-0027 GRANT DESTROYED THE FACTORIES AND THE MUNITIONS OF WAR WHICH WERE GATHERED THERE AND ALSO CAME INTO POSSESSION OF THE LINE OF RAILROAD WHICH RAN FROM JACKSON TO VICKSBURG WHILE HE WAS THUS ENGAGED
2827-170440-0028 AN INTERCEPTED MESSAGE REVEALED TO HIM THE FACT THAT PEMBERTON IN ACCORDANCE WITH JOHNSTON'S ORDERS HAD COME OUT OF VICKSBURG WITH TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEN AND WAS MOVING EASTWARD AGAINST HIM PEMBERTON HOWEVER INSTEAD OF HOLDING A STRAIGHT LINE AGAINST GRANT
2827-170440-0029 TURNED AT FIRST TO THE SOUTH WITH THE VIEW OF BREAKING THE LATTER'S LINE OF COMMUNICATION THIS WAS NOT A SUCCESS FOR AS GRANT SAYS WITH GRIM HUMOR I HAD NO LINE OF COMMUNICATION TO BREAK
2827-170440-0030 AND MOREOVER IT DELAYED PEMBERTON WHEN DELAY WAS OF VALUE TO GRANT IN FINISHING JOHNSTON AFTER THIS USELESS TURN TO THE SOUTHWARD PEMBERTON RESUMED HIS MARCH TO THE EAST AS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE IN THE BEGINNING IN ACCORDANCE WITH JOHNSTON'S ORDERS
2827-170440-0031 BUT GRANT WAS NOW MORE THAN READY HE DID NOT WAIT THE COMING OF PEMBERTON LEAVING JACKSON AS SOON AS HE HEARD OF THE ENEMY'S ADVANCE FROM VICKSBURG HE MARCHED RAPIDLY WESTWARD AND STRUCK PEMBERTON AT CHAMPION HILLS
2827-170440-0032 THE FORCES WERE AT THIS TIME VERY NEARLY MATCHED AND THE SEVEREST BATTLE OF THE CAMPAIGN ENSUED LASTING FOUR HOURS GRANT HOWEVER DEFEATED PEMBERTON COMPLETELY AND CAME VERY NEAR CAPTURING HIS ENTIRE FORCE
2827-170440-0033 WITH A BROKEN ARMY PEMBERTON FELL BACK ON VICKSBURG GRANT PURSUED WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY AND CAME UP WITH THE REAR GUARD AT BIG BLACK RIVER A SHARP ENGAGEMENT FOLLOWED AND THE CONFEDERATES WERE AGAIN DEFEATED
2827-170440-0034 GRANT THEN CROSSED THE BIG BLACK AND THE NEXT DAY WAS BEFORE VICKSBURG WITH HIS ENEMY INSIDE THE WORKS WHEN GRANT CROSSED THE MISSISSIPPI AT BRUINSBURG AND STRUCK INTO THE INTERIOR HE OF COURSE PASSED OUT OF COMMUNICATION WITH WASHINGTON
2827-170440-0035 AND HE DID NOT HEAR FROM THERE AGAIN UNTIL MAY ELEVENTH WHEN JUST AS HIS TROOPS WERE ENGAGING IN THE BATTLE OF BLACK RIVER BRIDGE AN OFFICER APPEARED FROM PORT HUDSON WITH AN ORDER FROM GENERAL HALLECK
2827-170440-0036 TO RETURN TO GRAND GULF AND THENCE COOPERATE WITH BANKS AGAINST PORT HUDSON GRANT REPLIED THAT THE ORDER CAME TOO LATE THE BEARER OF THE DESPATCH INSISTED THAT I OUGHT TO OBEY THE ORDER AND WAS GIVING ARGUMENTS TO SUPPORT THE POSITION
2827-170440-0037 WHEN I HEARD A GREAT CHEERING TO THE RIGHT OF OUR LINE AND LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION SAW LAWLER IN HIS SHIRT SLEEVES LEADING A CHARGE ON THE ENEMY I IMMEDIATELY MOUNTED MY HORSE AND RODE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CHARGE AND SAW NO MORE OF THE OFFICER WHO HAD DELIVERED THE MESSAGE
2827-170440-0038 I THINK NOT EVEN TO THIS DAY WHEN GRANT REACHED VICKSBURG THERE WAS NO FURTHER TALK OF RECALLING HIM TO GRAND GULF OR PORT HUDSON THE AUTHORITIES AT WASHINGTON THEN SAW PLAINLY ENOUGH WHAT HAD BEEN DONE IN THE INTERIOR OF MISSISSIPPI
2827-170440-0039 FAR FROM THE REACH OF TELEGRAPHS OR MAIL AS SOON AS THE NATIONAL TROOPS REACHED VICKSBURG AN ASSAULT WAS ATTEMPTED BUT THE PLACE WAS TOO STRONG AND THE ATTACK WAS REPULSED WITH HEAVY LOSS GRANT THEN SETTLED DOWN TO A SIEGE
2827-170440-0040 AND LINCOLN AND HALLECK NOW SENT HIM AMPLE REINFORCEMENTS HE NO LONGER NEEDED TO ASK FOR THEM HIS CAMPAIGN HAD EXPLAINED ITSELF AND IN A SHORT TIME HE HAD SEVENTY THOUSAND MEN UNDER HIS COMMAND
2827-170440-0041 HIS LINES WERE SOON MADE SO STRONG THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE DEFENDERS OF VICKSBURG TO BREAK THROUGH THEM AND ALTHOUGH JOHNSTON HAD GATHERED TROOPS AGAIN TO THE EASTWARD AN ASSAULT FROM THAT QUARTER ON THE NATIONAL ARMY NOW SO LARGELY REINFORCED
2827-170440-0042 WAS PRACTICALLY OUT OF THE QUESTION TIGHTER AND TIGHTER GRANT DREW HIS LINES ABOUT THE CITY WHERE EVERY DAY THE SUFFERING BECAME MORE INTENSE IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO GIVE THE DETAILS OF THE SIEGE ON JULY FOURTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
2827-170440-0043 VICKSBURG SURRENDERED THE MISSISSIPPI WAS IN CONTROL OF THE NATIONAL FORCES FROM ITS SOURCE TO ITS MOUTH AND THE CONFEDERACY WAS RENT IN TWAIN
2827-170440-0044 AND THESE TWO GREAT VICTORIES REALLY CRUSHED THE REBELLION ALTHOUGH MUCH HARD FIGHTING REMAINED TO BE DONE BEFORE THE END WAS REACHED GRANT'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST VICKSBURG DESERVES TO BE COMPARED WITH THAT OF NAPOLEON WHICH RESULTED IN THE FALL OF ULM
2827-170440-0045 IT WAS THE MOST BRILLIANT SINGLE CAMPAIGN OF THE WAR WITH AN INFERIOR FORCE AND ABANDONING HIS LINES OF COMMUNICATION MOVING WITH A MARVELOUS RAPIDITY THROUGH A DIFFICULT COUNTRY GRANT STRUCK THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE ENEMY ON THE LINE FROM JACKSON TO VICKSBURG
