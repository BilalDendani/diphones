2137-131742-0000 AND THE GIGANTIC INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE GROWN UP AND BEEN NOURISHED BY THEIR WORLD WIDE APPLICATION THAT HE WAS IN THIS INSTANCE A TRUE PIONEER AND CREATOR IS EVIDENT AS WE CONSIDER THE SUBJECT
2137-131742-0001 ISSUED TO EDISON ON JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOR AN INCANDESCENT LAMP WAS OF SUCH FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTER THAT IT OPENED UP AN ENTIRELY NEW AND TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT ART THE ART OF INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LIGHTING THIS STATEMENT CANNOT BE SUCCESSFULLY CONTROVERTED
2137-131742-0002 IF FURTHER PROOF WERE DESIRED IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO POINT TO THE FACT THAT AFTER THIRTY YEARS OF MOST STRENUOUS AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION IN THE ART BY THE KEENEST INTELLECTS OF THE WORLD EVERY INCANDESCENT LAMP THAT HAS EVER SINCE BEEN MADE INCLUDING THOSE OF MODERN DAYS
2137-131742-0003 IS STILL DEPENDENT UPON THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE ESSENTIALS DISCLOSED IN THE ABOVE NAMED PATENT NAMELY A FILAMENT OF HIGH RESISTANCE ENCLOSED IN A SEALED GLASS GLOBE EXHAUSTED OF AIR WITH CONDUCTING WIRES PASSING THROUGH THE GLASS
2137-131742-0004 THAT ITS INTRINSIC RELATION TO THE ART OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING IS FAR FROM BEING APPARENT AT SIGHT TO THE LAY MIND IT WOULD SEEM THAT THIS MUST HAVE BEEN THE OBVIOUS DEVICE TO MAKE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN ELECTRIC LIGHT BY INCANDESCENCE OF CARBON OR OTHER MATERIAL
2137-131742-0005 AND WAS ACTUALLY LIGHTING THEM UP TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY
2137-131742-0006 POSSIBLY A MOMENTARY SUCCESS MAGNIFIED TO THE DIGNITY OF A PERMANENT DEVICE BY AN OVERENTHUSIASTIC INVENTOR SUCH CRITICISM HOWEVER DID NOT DISTURB EDISON HE KNEW THAT HE HAD REACHED THE GOAL LONG AGO BY A CLOSE PROCESS OF REASONING
2137-131742-0007 AND WHICH WAS NOW EMBODIED IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF HIS INCANDESCENT LAMP NAMELY A FILAMENT OR CARBON OF HIGH RESISTANCE AND SMALL RADIATING SURFACE SEALED INTO A GLASS GLOBE EXHAUSTED OF AIR TO A HIGH DEGREE OF VACUUM IN ORIGINALLY COMMITTING HIMSELF TO THIS LINE OF INVESTIGATION
2137-131742-0008 THEIR EFFORTS HAD BEEN CONFINED TO LOW RESISTANCE BURNERS OF LARGE RADIATING SURFACE FOR THEIR LAMPS BUT HE REALIZED THE UTTER FUTILITY OF SUCH DEVICES
2137-131742-0009 HE WAS CONVINCED FROM THE FIRST THAT THE TRUE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM LAY IN A LAMP WHICH SHOULD HAVE AS ITS ILLUMINATING BODY A STRIP OF MATERIAL WHICH WOULD OFFER SUCH A RESISTANCE TO THE FLOW OF ELECTRIC CURRENT
2137-131742-0010 OR THE SAME GIVEN BATTERY WILL BRING A WIRE WHOSE TOTAL RESISTANCE IS FOUR OHMS TO THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS STRAIGHT WIRE THIS WAS ACTUALLY DETERMINED BY TRIAL
2137-131742-0011 IF ONE SQUARE INCH OF PLATINA BE HEATED TO ONE HUNDRED DEGREES IT WILL FALL TO SAY ZERO IN ONE SECOND WHEREAS IF IT WAS AT TWO HUNDRED DEGREES IT WOULD REQUIRE TWO SECONDS HENCE IN THE CASE OF INCANDESCENT CONDUCTORS
2137-131742-0012 NOTWITHSTANDING THE ORIGINAL TOTAL AMOUNT WAS BUT TWELVE HUNDRED BECAUSE THE RADIATION HAS BEEN REDUCED TO THREE QUARTERS OR SEVENTY FIVE UNITS HENCE THE EFFECT OF THE LESSENING OF THE RADIATION IS TO RAISE THE TEMPERATURE OF EACH REMAINING INCH NOT RADIATING TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DEGREES
2137-131742-0013 THE TEMPERATURE WOULD REACH SIXTY FOUR HUNDRED DEGREES FAHR TO CARRY OUT THIS LAW TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE IN REGARD TO PLATINA ET CETERA THEN WITH A GIVEN LENGTH OF WIRE TO QUADRUPLE THE HEAT WE MUST LESSEN THE RADIATING SURFACE TO ONE QUARTER AND TO DO THIS IN A SPIRAL
2137-131742-0014 THREE QUARTERS MUST BE WITHIN THE SPIRAL AND ONE QUARTER OUTSIDE FOR RADIATING HENCE A SQUARE WIRE OR OTHER MEANS SUCH AS A SPIRAL WITHIN A SPIRAL MUST BE USED
2137-131742-0015 AND THIS IS CONCENTRATED TO HAVE ONE QUARTER OF THE RADIATING SURFACE IT WOULD REACH A TEMPERATURE OF FOUR THOUSAND DEGREES OR SUFFICIENT TO MELT IT BUT SUPPOSING IT INFUSIBLE THE FURTHER CONCENTRATION TO ONE EIGHTH ITS SURFACE IT WOULD REACH A TEMPERATURE OF SIXTEEN THOUSAND DEGREES
2137-131742-0016 AND TO ONE THIRTY SECOND ITS SURFACE WHICH WOULD BE ABOUT THE RADIATING SURFACE OF THE ELECTRIC ARC IT WOULD REACH SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND DEGREES FAHR OF COURSE WHEN LIGHT IS RADIATED IN GREAT QUANTITIES NOT QUITE THESE TEMPERATURES WOULD BE REACHED ANOTHER CURIOUS LAW IS THIS
2137-131742-0017 AND THROUGH A CONCURRENT INVESTIGATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF HIGH VACUA AND OCCLUDED GASES WAS ABLE TO PRODUCE A TRUE INCANDESCENT LAMP NOT ONLY WAS IT A LAMP AS A MERE ARTICLE A DEVICE TO GIVE LIGHT
2137-131742-0018 TO EVERY PART OF WHICH IT BORE A FIXED AND DEFINITE RATIO AND IN RELATION TO WHICH IT WAS THE KEYSTONE THAT HELD THE STRUCTURE FIRMLY IN PLACE THE WORK OF EDISON ON INCANDESCENT LAMPS DID NOT STOP AT THIS FUNDAMENTAL INVENTION
2137-131742-0019 VAST INTERESTS WERE AT STAKE ALL OF THE TECHNICAL EXPERT AND PROFESSIONAL SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE THAT MONEY COULD PROCURE OR EXPERIENCE DEVISE WERE AVAILED OF IN THE BITTER FIGHTS THAT RAGED IN THE COURTS FOR MANY YEARS
2137-131742-0020 AND ALTHOUGH THE EDISON INTERESTS HAD SPENT FROM FIRST TO LAST NEARLY TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND HAD ONLY ABOUT THREE YEARS LEFT IN THE LIFE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PATENT EDISON WAS THOROUGHLY SUSTAINED AS TO PRIORITY BY THE DECISIONS IN THE VARIOUS SUITS
2137-131742-0021 WE SHALL OFFER A FEW BRIEF EXTRACTS FROM SOME OF THESE DECISIONS
2137-131742-0022 AND MISTER EDISON IS ENTITLED TO THE CREDIT OF OBVIATING THE MECHANICAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH DISHEARTENED THEM HE WAS THE FIRST TO MAKE A CARBON OF MATERIALS AND BY A PROCESS WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY DESIGNED TO IMPART HIGH SPECIFIC RESISTANCE TO IT
2137-131742-0023 BY DOING THESE THINGS HE MADE A LAMP WHICH WAS PRACTICALLY OPERATIVE AND SUCCESSFUL THE EMBRYO OF THE BEST LAMPS NOW IN COMMERCIAL USE
2137-131742-0024 BY SOME OF THE REAMED EXPERTS WHO ARE NOW WITNESSES TO BELITTLE HIS ACHIEVEMENT AND SHOW THAT IT DID NOT RISE TO THE DIGNITY OF AN INVENTION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST THE CONCLUSION THAT THE INVENTION OF THE SLENDER THREAD OF CARBON AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE BURNERS PREVIOUSLY EMPLOYED
2137-131742-0025 OPENED THE PATH TO THE PRACTICAL SUBDIVISION OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT AN APPEAL WAS TAKEN IN THE ABOVE SUIT TO THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS AND ON OCTOBER FOURTH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO THE DECREE OF THE LOWER COURT WAS AFFIRMED THE JUDGES
2137-131742-0026 WITHOUT THE PHENOMENON OF DISINTEGRATION THIS FACT HE UTILIZED BY THE MEANS WHICH HE HAS DESCRIBED A LAMP HAVING A FILAMENTARY CARBON BURNER IN A NEARLY PERFECT VACUUM
2137-131742-0027 DECIDED IN FAVOR OF EDISON ON JUNE ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR JUDGE COLT IN HIS OPINION SAID AMONG OTHER THINGS EDISON MADE AN IMPORTANT INVENTION HE PRODUCED THE FIRST PRACTICAL INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMP
2137-131742-0028 THE PATENT IS A PIONEER IN THE SENSE OF THE PATENT LAW IT MAY BE SAID THAT HIS INVENTION CREATED THE ART OF INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LIGHTING OPINIONS OF OTHER COURTS
