7512-98636-0000 BY THE SOPHISTICATED EYE A WOMAN'S AGE CAN BE TOLD
7512-98636-0001 THAN HER REAL AGE OR HESITATES TO TELL WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT HAVE PASSED OVER HER HEAD
7512-98636-0002 WHILE VERY YOUNG AND THE MANNER OF ARRANGING IT IS ONE OF THE DISTINCTIVE MARKS OF THE AGE OF THE CHILD
7512-98636-0003 UNTIL AT SIXTY OR SEVENTY IT IS NOT MORE THAN A FEW INCHES IN WIDTH THE NUMBER SIZE AND VARIETY OF ORNAMENTAL HAIRPINS AND THE TORTOISE SHELL COMB WORN IN FRONT ALL VARY WITH THE AGE
7512-98636-0004 AS THE TIME WHEN SHE WILL ATTAIN FREEDOM FROM HER LIFE LONG SERVICE TO THOSE ABOUT HER WILL BE IN THE POSITION OF ADVISER OF HER SONS AND DIRECTOR OF HER DAUGHTERS IN LAW WILL BE A PERSON OF MUCH CONSIDERATION IN THE FAMILY
7512-98636-0005 PRIVILEGED TO AMUSE HERSELF IN VARIOUS WAYS TO SPEAK HER OWN MIND ON MOST SUBJECTS AND TO BE WAITED UPON AND CARED FOR BY CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN IN RETURN FOR HER LONG YEARS OF FAITHFUL SERVICE IN THE HOUSEHOLD
7512-98636-0006 SHE WILL DOUBTLESS PERFORM MANY LIGHT TASKS FOR THE GENERAL GOOD WILL SELDOM SIT IDLE BY HERSELF BUT WILL HELP ABOUT THE SEWING AND MENDING
7512-98636-0007 TELL STORIES TO HER GRANDCHILDREN AFTER THEIR LESSONS ARE LEARNED GIVE THE BENEFIT OF HER YEARS OF EXPERIENCE TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL BEARING THE HEAT AND BURDEN OF THE DAY
7512-98636-0008 AND BY HER PRAYERS AND VISITS TO THE TEMPLE AT STATED SEASONS WILL SECURE THE FAVOR OF THE GODS FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY AS WELL AS MAKE HER OWN PREPARATIONS FOR ENTRY INTO THE GREAT UNKNOWN TOWARD WHICH SHE IS RAPIDLY DRIFTING
7512-98636-0009 AS SHE BEARS ALL THINGS ENDURES ALL THINGS SUFFERS LONG AND IS KIND AS SHE SERVES HER MOTHER IN LAW MANAGES HER HUSBAND'S HOUSEHOLD CARES FOR HER BABIES THE THOUGHT THAT CHEERS AND ENCOURAGES HER IN HER BUSY AND NOT TOO HAPPY LIFE IS THE THOUGHT OF THE SUNNY CALM OF OLD AGE
7512-98636-0010 WHEN SHE CAN LAY HER BURDENS AND CARES ON YOUNGER SHOULDERS AND BASK IN THE WARMTH AND SUNSHINE WHICH THIS INDIAN SUMMER OF HER LIFE WILL BRING TO HER IN THE CODE OF MORALS OF THE JAPANESE OBEDIENCE TO FATHER HUSBAND OR SON
7512-98636-0011 BUT THE OBEDIENCE AND RESPECT OF CHILDREN BOTH MALE AND FEMALE TO THEIR PARENTS ALSO OCCUPIES A PROMINENT POSITION IN THEIR ETHICAL SYSTEM HENCE IN THIS LATTER STAGE OF A WOMAN'S CAREER THE OBEDIENCE EXPECTED OF HER IS OFTEN ONLY NOMINAL
7512-98636-0012 AND IN ANY CASE IS NOT SO ABSOLUTE AND UNQUESTIONING AS THAT OF THE EARLY PERIOD AND THE CONSIDERATION AND RESPECT THAT A SON IS BOUND TO SHOW TO HIS MOTHER NECESSITATES A CARE OF HER COMFORT
7512-98636-0013 AND A CONSULTATION OF HER WISHES THAT RENDERS HER POSITION ONE OF MUCH GREATER FREEDOM THAN CAN BE OBTAINED BY ANY WOMAN EARLIER IN LIFE SHE HAS BESIDES REACHED AN AGE WHEN SHE IS NOT EXPECTED TO REMAIN AT HOME AND SHE MAY GO OUT INTO THE STREETS
7512-98636-0014 TO THE THEATRE OR OTHER SHOWS WITHOUT THE LEAST RESTRAINT OR FEAR OF LOSING HER DIGNITY A JAPANESE WOMAN LOSES HER BEAUTY EARLY AT THIRTY FIVE HER FRESH COLOR IS USUALLY ENTIRELY GONE HER EYES HAVE BEGUN TO SINK A LITTLE IN THEIR SOCKETS
7512-98636-0015 HAVE GIVEN PLACE TO AN ABSOLUTE LEANNESS HER ABUNDANT BLACK HAIR HAS GROWN THIN AND MUCH CARE AND ANXIETY HAVE GIVEN HER FACE
7512-98636-0016 ONE SELDOM SEES A FACE THAT INDICATES A SOURED TEMPER OR A CROSS DISPOSITION
7512-98636-0017 AND DISAPPOINTMENT PATIENTLY AND SWEETLY BORNE THE LIPS NEVER FORGET TO SMILE THE VOICE REMAINS ALWAYS CHEERFUL AND SYMPATHETIC NEVER GROWS PEEVISH AND WORRIED
7512-98636-0018 BUT YOUTH WITH ITS HOPEFUL OUTLOOK ITS PLANS AND ITS AMBITIONS GIVES WAY TO AGE WITH ITS PEACEFUL WAITING FOR THE END WITH ONLY A BRIEF STRUGGLE FOR ITS PLACE AND THE WOMAN OF THIRTY FIVE IS JUST AT THE POINT WHEN SHE HAS BID GOOD BY TO HER YOUTH
7512-98636-0019 AND HAVING LITTLE TO HOPE FOR IN HER MIDDLE LIFE IS DOING HER WORK FAITHFULLY AND LOOKING FORWARD TO AN OLD AGE OF PRIVILEGE AND AUTHORITY THE MISTRESS OF HER SON'S HOUSE AND THE RULER OF THE LITTLE DOMAIN OF HOME
7512-98636-0020 BUT I HAVE SPOKEN SO FAR ONLY OF THOSE HAPPY WOMEN WHOSE SONS GROW TO MATURITY AND WHO MANAGE TO EVADE THE DANGEROUS REEFS OF DIVORCE UPON WHICH SO MANY LIVES ARE SHIPWRECKED
7512-98636-0021 BUT WHO HAVE IN OLD AGE TO LIVE AS DEPENDENTS UPON THEIR BROTHERS OR NEPHEWS EVEN THESE WHO IN THIS COUNTRY OFTEN LEAD HARD AND UNREWARDED LIVES OF TOIL AMONG THEIR HAPPIER RELATIVES FIND IN OLD AGE A PLEASANTER LOT THAN THAT OF YOUTH
7512-98636-0022 MANY SUCH OLD LADIES I HAVE MET
7512-98636-0023 BUT WHOSE CHEERFUL WRINKLED FACES AND HAPPY CHILDLIKE WAYS HAVE GIVEN ONE A FEELING OF PLEASURE THAT THE SORROW IS PAST AND PEACE AND REST HAVE COME TO THEIR DECLINING YEARS FULFILLING WHAT LITTLE HOUSEHOLD TASKS THEY CAN
7512-98636-0024 RESPECTED AND SELF RESPECTING MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD
7512-98636-0025 BUT BOTH ALIKE FIND A PEACEFUL SHELTER IN THE HOMES OF THOSE NEAREST AND DEAREST TO THEM ONE OF THE HAPPIEST OLD LADIES I HAVE EVER SEEN WAS ONE WHO HAD HAD A ROUGH AND STORMY LIFE
7512-98636-0026 THE MOTHER OF MANY CHILDREN MOST OF WHOM HAD DIED IN INFANCY SHE WAS AT LAST LEFT CHILDLESS AND A WIDOW IN HER CHILDREN'S DEATH THE LAST TIE THAT BOUND HER TO HER HUSBAND'S FAMILY WAS BROKEN AND
7512-98636-0027 RATHER THAN BE A BURDEN TO THEM SHE MADE HER HOME FOR MANY YEARS WITH HER OWN YOUNGER BROTHER TAKING UP AGAIN THE MANY CARES AND DUTIES OF A MOTHER'S LIFE IN SHARING WITH THE MOTHER THE BRINGING UP OF A LARGE FAMILY OF CHILDREN ONE BY ONE FROM THE OLDEST TO THE YOUNGEST
7512-98636-0028 EACH HAS LEARNED TO LOVE THE OLD AUNTY TO BE LULLED ASLEEP ON HER BACK
7512-98636-0029 THE DRIVES AND WALKS ENJOYED IN HER COMPANY THE TOYS AND CANDIES THAT CAME OUT UNEXPECTEDLY FROM THE DEPTHS OF MYSTERIOUS DRAWERS TO COMFORT MANY AN HOUR OF CHILDISH GRIEF
7512-98636-0030 THAT WAS YEARS AGO AND THE OLD AUNTY'S HARD TIMES ARE NEARLY OVER HALE AND HEARTY AT THREE SCORE YEARS AND TEN SHE HAS SEEN THESE CHILDREN GROW UP ONE BY ONE UNTIL NOW SOME HAVE GONE TO NEW HOMES OF THEIR OWN HER BENT FORM AND WRINKLED FACE
7512-98636-0031 ARE EVER WELCOME TO HER CHILDREN HERS BY THE RIGHT OF YEARS OF PATIENT CARE AND TOIL FOR THEM THEY NOW IN THEIR TURN ENJOY GIVING HER PLEASURE AND RETURN TO HER ALL THE LOVE SHE HAS LAVISHED UPON THEM IT IS A JOY TO SEE HER CHILDLIKE PRIDE AND CONFIDENCE IN THEM ALL
7512-98636-0032 AND TO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE FILLED THE PLACE LEFT VACANT BY THE DEAD WITH WHOM HAD DIED ALL HER HOPES OF EARTHLY HAPPINESS THE OLD WOMEN OF JAPAN HOW THEIR WITHERED FACES BENT FRAMES AND SHRUNKEN YELLOW HANDS ABIDE IN ONE'S MEMORY
7512-98636-0033 ONE SELDOM SEES AMONG THEM WHAT WE WOULD CALL BEAUTY FOR THE ALMOST UNIVERSAL SHRINKING WITH AGE THAT TAKES PLACE AMONG THE JAPANESE COVERS THE FACE WITH MULTITUDINOUS WRINKLES
7512-98636-0034 FOR THE SKIN WHICH IN YOUTH IS USUALLY BRIGHTENED BY RED CHEEKS AND GLOSSY BLACK HAIR IN OLD AGE WHEN COLOR LEAVES CHEEK AND HAIR HAS A CURIOUSLY YELLOW AND PARCHMENT LIKE LOOK BUT WITH ALL THEIR WRINKLES AND UGLINESS
7512-98636-0035 THERE IS A PECULIAR CHARM ABOUT THE OLD WOMEN OF JAPAN IN T O KY O WHEN THE GRASS GROWS LONG UPON YOUR LAWN AND YOU SEND TO THE GARDENER TO COME AND CUT IT NO BOY WITH PATENT LAWN MOWER NOR STALWART COUNTRYMAN WITH SCYTHE AND SICKLE ANSWERS YOUR SUMMONS
7512-98636-0036 BUT SOME MORNING YOU AWAKE TO FIND YOUR LAWN COVERED WITH OLD WOMEN
7512-98636-0037 WITH AN ENORMOUS PAIR OF SHEARS THE OLD LADIES CLIP AND CHATTER CHEERFULLY ALL DAY LONG UNTIL THE LAWN IS AS SMOOTH AS VELVET UNDER THEIR CAREFUL CUTTING AN OCCASIONAL REST UNDER A TREE FOR PIPES AND TEA
7512-98636-0038 IS THE TIME FOR MUCH CHEERFUL TALK AND GOSSIP BUT THE WORK THOUGH DONE SLOWLY AND WITH DUE ATTENTION TO THE COMFORT OF THE WORKER IS WELL DONE AND CERTAINLY ACCOMPLISHED AS RAPIDLY AS ANY ONE COULD EXPECT OF LABORERS WHO EARN ONLY FROM EIGHT TO TWELVE CENTS A DAY
7512-98636-0039 ANOTHER EMPLOYMENT FOR THIS SAME CLASS OF LABORERS IS THE PICKING OF MOSS AND GRASS FROM THE CREVICES OF THE GREAT WALLS THAT INCLOSE THE MOATS AND EMBANKMENTS OF THE CAPITAL MOUNTED ON LITTLE LADDERS
7512-98636-0040 THEY PICK AND SCRAPE WITH KNIVES UNTIL THE WALL IS CLEAR AND FRESH WITH NO INSIDIOUS GROWTH TO PUSH THE GREAT UNCEMENTED STONES OUT OF THEIR PLACES IN CONTRAST WITH THESE HUMBLE BUT CHEERFUL TOILERS MAY BE MENTIONED ANOTHER CLASS OF WOMEN
7512-98636-0041 DRESSED IN RAGS AND WITH COVERED HEADS AND FACES THEY WANDER ABOUT THE STREETS PLAYING THE SAMISEN OUTSIDE THE LATTICED WINDOWS AND SINGING WITH CRACKED VOICES SOME WAILING MELODY AS THEY GO FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE GAINING A MISERABLE
7512-98636-0042 PITTANCE BY THEIR WEIRD MUSIC THEY SEEM THE EMBODIMENT OF ALL THAT IS HOPELESS AND BROKEN HEARTED
7512-98636-0043 WHO DANCED AND SANG THROUGH THE BRIEF SUMMER TO COME WAILING AND WRETCHED SEEKING AID FROM HER THRIFTIER NEIGHBOR WHEN AT LAST THE WINTER CLOSED IN UPON HER
7512-98636-0044 TROTTING ABOUT WITH A YOKE OVER HER SHOULDERS FROM WHICH ARE SUSPENDED TWO SWINGING BASKETS FILLED WITH FRESH VEGETABLES
7512-98636-0045 ANOTHER PICTURE COMES TO ME TOO A PICTURE OF ONE WHOSE MEMORY IS AN INSPIRING THOUGHT TO THE MANY WHO HAVE THE HONOR TO CALL HER MOTHER A STATELY OLD LADY LEFT A WIDOW MANY YEARS AGO
7512-98636-0046 BEFORE THE RECENT CHANGES HAD WROUGHT HAVOC PREPARATORY TO FURTHER PROGRESS SHE SEEMED ALWAYS TO ME THE MODEL OF A MOTHER OF THE OLD SCHOOL HERSELF A WOMAN OF THOROUGH CLASSICAL EDUCATION
7512-98636-0047 HER EXAMPLE AND TEACHING WERE TO BOTH SONS AND DAUGHTERS A CONSTANT INSPIRATION AND IN HER OLD AGE SHE FOUND HERSELF THE HONORED HEAD OF A FAMILY WELL KNOWN IN THE ARTS OF WAR AND PEACE A GOODLY COMPANY OF SONS AND DAUGHTERS
7512-98636-0048 EVERY ONE OF THEM HEIRS OF HER SPIRIT AND OF HER INTELLECT THOUGH CONSERVATIVE HERSELF AND ALWAYS CLINGING TO THE OLD CUSTOMS
7512-98636-0049 TRIED BY WAR BY SIEGE BY BANISHMENT BY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS OF ALL KINDS
7512-98636-0050 OF PROSPERITY AMONG CHILDREN OF WHOM SHE MIGHT WELL BE PROUD KEEPING HER PHYSICAL VIGOR TO THE END AND DYING AT LAST AFTER AN ILLNESS OF ONLY TWO DAYS HER SPIRIT PASSED OUT INTO THE GREAT UNKNOWN READY TO MEET ITS DANGERS AS BRAVELY
7512-98636-0051 AS SHE HAD MET THOSE OF EARTH OR TO ENJOY ITS REST AS SWEETLY AND APPRECIATIVELY AS SHE HAD ENJOYED THAT OF HER OLD AGE IN THE HOUSE OF HER OLDEST SON MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER WAS LIMITED BY OUR LACK OF COMMON LANGUAGE
7512-98636-0052 BUT WAS A MOST ADMIRING AND APPRECIATIVE ONE ON MY SIDE
7512-98636-0053 THAT UPON MY LAST MEETING WITH HER TWO WEEKS BEFORE HER DEATH SHE GAVE ME HER WRINKLED BUT STILL BEAUTIFUL AND DELICATELY SHAPED HAND AT PARTING A DEFERENCE TO FOREIGN CUSTOMS THAT SHE ONLY PAID UPON SPECIAL OCCASIONS
7512-98636-0054 TWO WEEKS LATER AMID SUCH RAIN AS JAPANESE SKIES KNOW ALL TOO WELL HOW TO LET FALL I ATTENDED HER FUNERAL AT THE CEMETERY OF AOYAMA
7512-98636-0055 THE CEMETERY CHAPEL WAS CROWDED BUT A PLACE WAS RESERVED FOR ME ON ACCOUNT OF SPECIAL TIES THAT BOUND ME TO THE FAMILY JUST BEHIND THE LONG LINE OF WHITE ROBED MOURNERS
7512-98636-0056 AND BY THE BUDDHIST CEREMONIAL SHE WAS BURIED THE CHANTED RITUAL
7512-98636-0057 THE RELATIVES AROSE ONE BY ONE
7512-98636-0058 THEN BOWING AGAIN RETIRED TO THEIR PLACES SLOWLY AND SOLEMNLY FROM THE TALL SOLDIER SON HIS HAIR ALREADY STREAKED WITH GRAY
7512-98636-0059 AND AFTER THE RELATIVES THE GUESTS
7512-98636-0060 STEPPED FORWARD AND PERFORMED THE SAME CEREMONY BEFORE LEAVING THE ROOM WHAT THE MEANING OF THE RITE WAS I DID NOT KNOW WHETHER A WORSHIP OF STRANGE GODS OR NO BUT TO ME AS I PERFORMED THE ACT
7512-98636-0061 IT ONLY SIGNIFIED THE HONOR IN WHICH I HELD THE MEMORY OF A HEROIC WOMAN WHO HAD DONE WELL HER PART IN THE WORLD ACCORDING TO THE LIGHT THAT GOD HAD GIVEN HER JAPANESE ART LOVES TO PICTURE THE OLD WOMAN WITH HER KINDLY WRINKLED FACE
7512-98636-0062 LEAVING OUT NO WRINKLE OF THEM ALL BUT GIVING WITH EQUAL TRUTHFULNESS THE CHARM OF EXPRESSION THAT ONE FINDS IN THEM
7512-98636-0063 FOR ONLY BY LONG LIFE CAN A WOMAN ATTAIN THE GREATEST HONOR AND HAPPINESS WE OFTEN EXCLAIM IN IMPATIENCE AT THE THOUGHT OF THE WEAKNESS AND DEPENDENCE OF OLD AGE AND PRAY THAT WE MAY DIE IN THE FULLNESS OF OUR POWERS BEFORE THE DECAY
7512-98636-0064 OF ADVANCING YEARS HAS MADE US A BURDEN UPON OUR FRIENDS BUT IN JAPAN DEPENDENCE IS THE LOT OF WOMAN AND THE DEPENDENCE OF OLD AGE IS THAT WHICH IS MOST RESPECTED AND CONSIDERED AN AGED PARENT IS NEVER A BURDEN
7512-98636-0065 AND IF TIMES ARE HARD AND FOOD AND OTHER COMFORTS ARE SCARCE THE CHILDREN AS A MATTER OF COURSE DEPRIVE THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN TO GIVE UNGRUDGINGLY TO THEIR OLD FATHER AND MOTHER FAULTS THERE ARE MANY IN THE JAPANESE SOCIAL SYSTEM
7512-98636-0066 BUT INGRATITUDE TO PARENTS OR DISRESPECT TO THE AGED MUST NOT BE NAMED AMONG THEM AND YOUNG AMERICA MAY LEARN A SALUTARY LESSON BY THE STUDY OF THE PLACE THAT OLD PEOPLE OCCUPY IN THE HOME
7512-98636-0067 IT IS NOT ONLY FOR THE WOMEN OF JAPAN BUT FOR THE MEN AS WELL THAT OLD AGE IS A TIME OF PEACE AND HAPPINESS WHEN A MAN REACHES THE AGE OF FIFTY OR THEREABOUTS OFTEN WHILE APPARENTLY IN THE HEIGHT OF HIS VIGOR HE GIVES UP HIS WORK OR BUSINESS AND RETIRES LEAVING ALL THE PROPERTY
7512-98636-0068 AND INCOME TO THE CARE OF HIS ELDEST SON UPON WHOM HE BECOMES ENTIRELY DEPENDENT FOR HIS SUPPORT
7512-98636-0069 THIS SUPPORT IS NEVER BEGRUDGED HIM FOR THE CARE OF PARENTS BY THEIR CHILDREN IS AS MUCH A MATTER OF COURSE IN JAPAN AS THE CARE OF CHILDREN BY THOSE WHO GIVE THEM BIRTH A MAN THUS RARELY MAKES PROVISION FOR THE FUTURE
7512-98636-0070 AND LOOKS WITH SCORN ON FOREIGN CUSTOMS WHICH SEEM TO BETOKEN A FEAR LEST IN OLD AGE UNGRATEFUL CHILDREN MAY NEGLECT THEIR PARENTS AND CAST THEM ASIDE THE FEELING SO STRONG IN AMERICA THAT DEPENDENCE IS OF ITSELF IRKSOME AND A THING TO BE DREADED
7512-98636-0071 IS ALTOGETHER STRANGE TO THE JAPANESE MIND
7512-98636-0072 AND INDEPENDENT HOME OF HIS OWN AND TO SUPPORT HER AND HER CHILDREN BY HIS OWN LABOR OR ON HIS OWN INCOME BUT HE TAKES HER TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND THINKS IT NO SHAME THAT HIS FAMILY LIVE UPON HIS PARENTS BUT IN RETURN WHEN THE PARENTS WISH TO RETIRE FROM ACTIVE LIFE
7512-98636-0073 FOR IT IS GIVEN FREELY TO THE TIME HONORED EUROPEAN BELIEF THAT A YOUNG MAN MUST BE INDEPENDENT AND ENTERPRISING IN EARLY LIFE IN ORDER TO LAY BY FOR OLD AGE THE JAPANESE WILL ANSWER THAT CHILDREN IN JAPAN ARE TAUGHT TO LOVE THEIR PARENTS
7512-98636-0074 RATHER THAN EASE AND LUXURY AND THAT CARE FOR THE FUTURE IS NOT THE NECESSITY THAT IT IS IN EUROPE AND AMERICA WHERE MONEY
7512-98636-0075 THIS HABIT OF THOUGHT MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE UTTER WANT OF PROVISION FOR THE FUTURE AND THE DISREGARD FOR THINGS PERTAINING TO THE ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH WHICH OFTEN STRIKES CURIOUSLY THE FOREIGNER IN JAPAN
7512-98636-0076 A JAPANESE CONSIDERS HIS PROVISION FOR THE FUTURE MADE WHEN HE HAS BROUGHT UP AND EDUCATED FOR USEFULNESS A LARGE FAMILY OF CHILDREN HE INVESTS HIS CAPITAL IN THEIR SUPPORT AND EDUCATION SECURE OF BOUNTIFUL RETURNS IN THEIR GRATITUDE AND CARE FOR HIS OLD AGE
7512-98636-0077 IT IS HARD FOR THE MEN OF OLD JAPAN TO UNDERSTAND THE RUSH AND STRUGGLE FOR RICHES IN AMERICA A STRUGGLE THAT TOO OFTEN LEAVES NOT A PAUSE FOR REST OR QUIET PLEASURE
7512-98636-0078 THE CARES OF THE WORLD TO HAVE A FEW YEARS OF CALM AND PEACE UNDISTURBED BY RESPONSIBILITIES OR CARES FOR OUTSIDE MATTERS
7512-98636-0079 IF HE BE AN ARTIST OR A POET HE MAY UNINTERRUPTED SPEND HIS DAYS WITH HIS BELOVED ART IF HE IS FOND OF THE CEREMONIAL TEA
7512-98636-0080 AND EVEN IF HE HAS NONE OF THESE HIGHER TASTES HE WILL ALWAYS HAVE CONGENIAL FRIENDS WHO ARE READY TO SHARE
7512-98636-0081 TO JOIN IN A QUIET SMOKE OVER THE HIBACHI OR TO PLAY THE DEEP ENGROSSING GAME OF GO OR SHOGI
7512-98636-0082 CARED FOR AND PROTECTED BY THEM SOMETIMES THERE WILL BE A SEPARATE SUITE OF ROOMS PROVIDED FOR THEM SOMETIMES A LITTLE HOUSE AWAY FROM THE NOISES OF THE HOUSEHOLD
7512-98636-0083 IN ANY CASE AS LONG AS THEY LIVE THEY WILL SPEND THEIR DAYS IN QUIET AND PEACE
