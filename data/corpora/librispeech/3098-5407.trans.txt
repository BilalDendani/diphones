3098-5407-0000 CAPTAIN WILL RATLIN THE WATCH BELOW AFTER COMPLETING THE WORK WHICH HAD SUMMONED THEM FOR THE TIME BEING ON DECK TUMBLED HELTER SKELTER DOWN THE FORE HATCH ONCE MORE
3098-5407-0001 AND LEFT ON THE DECK OF THE SEA WITCH ABOUT A DOZEN ABLE SEAMEN WHO FORMED THE WATCH UPON DECK A NUMBER OF THESE WERE NOW GATHERED IN A KNOT ON THE FORECASTLE AND WHILE THEY WERE SITTING CROSS LEGGED PICKING OLD ROPE
3098-5407-0002 AND PREPARING IT IN SUITABLE FORM FOR CAULKING THE SHIP'S SEAMS ONE OF THEIR NUMBER WAS SPINNING A YARN
3098-5407-0003 THE OBJECT OF THEIR REMARKS MEANWHILE STOOD ONCE MORE QUIETLY LEANING OVER THE MONKEY RAIL ON THE WEATHER SIDE OF THE QUARTER DECK QUITE UNCONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS SUPPLYING A THEME OF ENTERTAINMENT TO THE FORECASTLE THERE WAS AN ABSENT EXPRESSION IN HIS HANDSOME FACE
3098-5407-0004 A LOOK AS THOUGH HIS HEART WAS FAR DISTANT FROM THE SCENE ABOUT HIM AND YET A HABIT OF WATCHFUL CAUTION SEEMED EVER AND ANON TO RECALL HIS SENSES AND HIS QUICK KEEN GLANCE WOULD RUN OVER THE CRAFT FROM STEM TO STERN WITH A SEARCHING AND COMPREHENSIVE POWER
3098-5407-0005 THAT SHOWED HIM MASTER OF HIS PROFESSION AND WORTHY HIS TRUST TRUST WHAT WAS THE TRUST HE HELD SURELY NO LEGITIMATE COMMERCE COULD WARRANT THE OUTFIT OF SUCH A VESSEL AS HE CONTROLLED
3098-5407-0006 A MAN OF WAR COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN MORE FULLY EQUIPPED WITH MEANS OF OFFENCE AND DEFENCE AMIDSHIP BENEATH THAT LONG BOAT WAS A LONG HEAVY METALLED GUN THAT WORKED ON A TRAVERSE AND WHICH COULD COMMAND NEARLY EVERY POINT OF THE COMPASS
3098-5407-0007 WHILE THE SHIP KEPT HER COURSE JUST INSIDE THE RISE OF THE LOW QUARTER DECK THE CABIN BEING ENTERED FROM THE DECK BY THE DESCENT OF A COUPLE OF STEPS THERE WERE RANGED BOARDING PIKES MUSKETS CUTLASSES AND PISTOLS READY FOR INSTANT USE
3098-5407-0008 IN SHAPE THEY FORMED STARS HEARTS AND DIAMONDS DANGEROUS BUT FANTASTIC ORNAMENTS THE BRIGHTNESS OF THESE ARMS AND THE HANDY WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE ARRANGED IN THE SOCKETS MADE TO RECEIVE THEM SHOWED AT ONCE THAT THEY WERE DESIGNED FOR USE
3098-5407-0009 WHILE THE VARIOUS OTHER FIXTURES OF THE CABIN AND DOCKS PLAINLY BESPOKE PREPARATION FOR CONFLICT A STRONG AND LOFTY BOARDING NETTING BEING STOWED ALSO TOLD OF THE READINESS OF THE SEA WITCH TO REPEL BOARDERS
3098-5407-0010 THAT ALL THESE PREPARATIONS HAD BEEN MADE MERELY AS ORDINARY PRECAUTIONS IN A PEACEFUL TRADE WAS BY NO MEANS PROBABLE AND YET THERE THEY WERE AND THERE STOOD THE BRIGHT EYED HANDSOME AND YOUTHFUL COMMANDER UPON THE QUARTER DECK BUT HE DID NOT LOOK THE DESPERADO
3098-5407-0011 WHERE AN ENGLISH OR FRENCH CRUISER WAS VERY LIKELY TO CROSS HIS TRACK HE HANDLES A SHIP AS PRETTILY AS EVER A TRUE BLUE DID YET SAID ONE OF THE FORECASTLE GROUP IN REPLYING TO SOME REMARK OF A COMRADE CONCERNING THE COMMANDER
3098-5407-0012 THAT'S TRUE ANSWERED ANOTHER HE SEEMS TO HAVE A SORT OF NATURAL WAY WITH HIM
3098-5407-0013 AND AS TO THAT MATTER THERE MAY BE THEM ON BOARD WHO SAY AS MUCH OF HIM THAT ISN'T FAR FROM THE TRUTH ANSWERED BILL MARLINE SEEIN HE STARTED SO ARLY ON THE SEA HE CAN'T TELL WHEN HE WASN'T THERE HIMSELF
3098-5407-0014 HOW WAS THAT MATTER BILL ASKED ONE OF HIS MESSMATES THEY SAY YOU HAVE KEPT THE CAPTAIN'S RECKONING MAN AND BOY THESE FIFTEEN YEARS THAT HAVE I AND NEVER A TRUER HEART FLOATED THAN THE MAN YOU SEE YONDER LEANING OVER THE RAIL ON THE QUARTERDECK WHERE HE BELONGS
3098-5407-0015 ANSWERED BILL MARLINE HOW DID YOU FIRST FALL IN WITH HIM BILL TELL US THAT SAID ONE OF THE CREW WELL DO YE SEE MESSMATES IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE MATTER OF THIRTEEN YEARS AGO THERE OR THEREABOUTS BUT I CAN'T EXACTLY SAY
3098-5407-0016 SEEING'S I NEVER HAVE KEPT A LOG AND CAN'T WRITE BUT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT THAT LENGTH OF TIME WHEN I WAS A FOREMAST HAND ON BOARD THE SEA LION AS FINE AN INDIAMAN AS YOU WOULD WISH TO SEE WE WERE LYING IN THE LIVERPOOL DOCKS WITH SAILS BENT AND CARGO STOWED
3098-5407-0017 UNDER SAILING ORDERS WHEN ONE AFTERNOON THERE STROLLED ALONGSIDE A BOY RATHER RAGGED AND DIRTY
3098-5407-0018 WELL DO YE SEE WE WERE LAZING AWAY TIME ON BOARD AND WAITING THE CAPTAIN'S COMING BEFORE WE HAULED OUT INTO THE STREAM AND SO WE COAXED THE LAD ABOARD HE EITHER DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE CAME FROM OR WOULDN'T TELL
3098-5407-0019 AND WHEN WE PROPOSED TO TAKE HIM TO SEA WITH US HE READILY AGREED AND SURE ENOUGH HE SAILED IN THE SEA LION WELL HEAVE AHEAD BILL SAID ONE OF THE GROUP AS THE NARRATOR STOPPED TO STOVE A FRESH INSTALMENT OF THE VIRGINIA WEED IN HIS LARBOARD CHEEK
3098-5407-0020 HEAVE AHEAD WE HADN'T GOT FAIRLY CLEAR OF THE CHANNEL CONTINUED BILL MARLINE BEFORE THE BOY HAD BECOME A GENERAL FAVORITE ALL OVER THE SHIP WE WASHED HIM UP AND BENT ON A NEW SUIT OF TOGGERY ON HIM WITH A REG'LAR TARPAULIN
3098-5407-0021 AND THERE WAS ALMOST A FIGHT WHETHER THE FORECASTLE OR THE CABIN SHOULD HAVE HIM AT LAST IT WAS LEFT TO THE BOY HIMSELF AND HE CHOSE TO REMAIN WITH US IN THE FORECASTLE THE BOY WASN'T SICK AN HOUR ON THE PASSAGE UNTIL AFTER WE LEFT THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE WHEN THE FLAG HALLIARDS GETTING FOULED
3098-5407-0022 HE WAS SENT UP TO THE PEAK TO LOOSEN IT
3098-5407-0023 BUT THE BOY WAS CRAZY FOR NEAR A MONTH FROM THE BLOW ON HIS HEAD WHICH HE GOT IN FALLING BUT HE GRADUALLY GOT CURED UNDER OUR CAPTAIN'S CARE WELL DO YE SEE OUR CAPTAIN WAS A REGULAR WHOLE SOULED FELLOW
3098-5407-0024 THOUGH HE DID SOMETIMES WORK UP A HAND'S OLD IRON PRETTY CLOSE FOR HIM
3098-5407-0025 AND AS HE GREW BETTER TOOK TO TEACHING HIM THE USE OF HIS INSTRUMENTS AND MATHEMATICS AND THE LIKE THE BOY THEY SAID WAS WONDERFUL READY AND LEARNED LIKE A BOOK AND COULD TAKE THE SUN AND WORK UP THE SHIP'S COURSE AS WELL AS THE CAPTAIN
3098-5407-0026 BUT WHAT WAS THE FUNNIEST OF ALL WAS THAT AFTER HE GOT WELL HE DIDN'T KNOW ONE OF US HE HAD FORGOTTEN OR EVEN HOW HE CAME ON BOARD THE SHIP
3098-5407-0027 TO MY MIND HOWDSOMEVER IT WASN'T MUCH TO FORGET SEEING HE WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN A BABY AND HADN'T BEEN TO SEA AT ALL AND YOU KNOW THERE AINT ANYTHING WORTH KNOWING ON SHORE MORE'N ONE CAN OVERHAUL IN A DAY'S LEAVE MORE OR LESS WITHIN HAIL OF THE SEA
3098-5407-0028 THAT'S TRUE GROWLED ONE OR TWO OF HIS MESSMATES OUR SHIP WAS A FIRST CLASS FREIGHTER AND PASSAGE VESSEL AND ON THE HOME VOYAGE WE HAD PLENTY OF LADIES
3098-5407-0029 HE WAS CONSTANTLY LEARNING SOMETHING
3098-5407-0030 AND THEN AS I SAID BEFORE
3098-5407-0031 AND WHEN MASTER WILL RATLIN FOR THAT WAS A NAME WE GIVE HIM WHEN HE FIRST CAME ON BOARD AND HE'S KEPT IT EVER SINCE WAS A MATTER OF FOURTEEN YEARS HE WAS NEARLY AS BIG AS HE IS NOW AND ACTED AS MATE
3098-5407-0032 I NEVER SEED A BETTER SEAMAN OF TWICE HIS YEARS ALWAYS SAVIN PRESENT COMPANY MESSMATES IN COURSE BILL GROWLED THREE OR FOUR OF HIS MESSMATES HEARTILY WELL DO YE SEE MESSMATES WE CONTINUED TOGETHER IN THE SAME SHIP FOR THE MATTER OF FIVE YEARS
3098-5407-0033 AND THEN MASTER WILL AND I SHIPPED IN ANOTHER INDIAMAN AND WE WERE IN THE BIRMINGHAM FOR THREE YEARS OR MORE ONE DAY WE LAY OFF THE CAPE ON THE HOME PASSAGE
3098-5407-0034 AND SOMEHOW I GOT RATHER MORE GROG ABOARD THAN I COULD STOW AND WHEN I CAME OFF THE CAPTAIN SWORE AT ME LIKE A PIRATE AND AFTER I GOT SOBER TRICED ME UP TO THE MAIN RIGGING FOR A ROUND DOZEN
3098-5407-0035 SHIVER MY TIMBERS IF MASTER WILL RATLIN WHO WAS THE FIRST MATE DIDN'T WALK BOLDLY UP TO THE CAPTAIN AND SAY BLUNT AND HONEST CAPTAIN BRACE MARLINE IS AN OLD AND FAVORITE SEAMAN AND IF YOU WILL LET THIS OFFENCE PASS WITHOUT FURTHER PUNISHMENT
3098-5407-0036 I WILL ANSWER FOR HIS FUTURE GOOD BEHAVIOUR AT ALL TIMES I ASK IT SIR AS A PERSONAL FAVOR BUT DISCIPLINE DISCIPLINE MUST BE OBSERVED MISTER RATLIN I ACKNOWLEDGE HE'S IN FAULT SIR SAID OUR MATE
3098-5407-0037 AND DESERVES THE PUNISHMENT SAID THE CAPTAIN I FEAR HE DOES SIR BUT YET I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE A GOOD SEAMAN FLOGGED SAID THE MATE APOLOGETICALLY NOR I EITHER SAID THE CAPTAIN BUT BILL MARLINE DESERVES THE CAT
3098-5407-0038 THOUGH AS YOU MAKE IT A PERSONAL MATTER WHY I'LL LET HIM OFF THIS TIME MISTER RATLIN THE CAPTAIN DIDN'T WISH TO LET ME GO BUT HE SAID HE WISHED TO GRATIFY HIS MATE AND SO I WAS CAST LOOSE AND AFTER A BROADSIDE OF ADVICE AND A HURRICANE OF OATHS
3098-5407-0039 WAS TURNED OVER TO DUTY AGAIN I DIDN'T FORGET THAT FAVOR MESSMATES AND SINK ME IF I WOULDN'T GO TO THE BOTTOM TO SERVE HIM ANY TIME HE COMMANDED A BRIG IN THE SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE AFTER THAT AND WOULD HAVE MADE A MATE OF ME
3098-5407-0040 BUT SOMEHOW I'VE GOT A WEAKNESS FOR GROG THAT ISN'T VERY SAFE AND SO HE KNOWS TWONT DO YOU SEE HIM THERE NOW MESSMATES AS CALM AS A LADY BUT HE'S AWAKE WHEN THERE'S NEED OF IT THE MAN DON'T LIVE THAT CAN HANDLE A SHIP BETTER THAN HE AND AS FOR FIGHTING
3098-5407-0041 DO YE SEE MESSMATES WE WERE RUNNING ON THIS HERE SAME TACK JUST OFF THE BUT AVAST UPON THAT I HAVEN'T ANY MORE TO SAY MESSMATES SAID THE SPEAKER DEMURELY
3098-5407-0042 BILL MARLINE EVIDENTLY FOUND HIMSELF TREADING UPON DANGEROUS GROUND AND WISELY CUT SHORT HIS YARN THEREBY CREATING A VAST AMOUNT OF CURIOSITY AMONG HIS MESSMATES BUT HE STERNLY REFUSED TO SPEAK FURTHER UPON THE SUBJECT
3098-5407-0043 EITHER HIS COMMANDER HAD PROHIBITED HIM OR HE FOUND THAT BY SPEAKING HE SHOULD IN SOME WAY COMPROMISE THE CREDIT OR HONOR OF ONE UPON WHOM HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED AS BEING LITTLE LESS THAN ONE OF A SUPERIOR ORDER OF BEINGS TO HIMSELF
3098-5407-0044 PAY OUT OLD FELLOW THERE'S PLENTY OF SEA ROOM AND NO LAND SHARKS TO FEAR SAID ONE OF THE GROUP ENCOURAGINGLY NEVER YOU MIND MESSMATES THERE'S NOTHING LIKE KEEPING A CIVIL TONGUE IN YOUR HEAD ESPECIALLY BEING QUIET ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS ADDED BILL
3098-5407-0045 WHAT THINK YOU BILL OF THIS PRESENT VOCATION EH ASKED ANOTHER COMPANION I SHIPPED FOR SIX MONTHS THAT'S ALL I KNOW AND NO QUESTIONS ASKED I UNDERSTAND VERY WELL THAT CAPTAIN RATLIN WOULDN'T SHIP ME WHERE HE WOULDN'T GO HIMSELF
3098-5407-0046 WELL DO YOU SEE BILL MOST OF US ARE NEW ON BOARD HERE THOUGH WE HAVE KNOCKED ABOUT LONG ENOUGH TO GET THE NUMBER OF OUR MESS AND TO WORK SHIP TOGETHER AND DON'T PERHAPS FEEL SO WELL SATISFIED AS YOU DO
3098-5407-0047 WHY LOOK YE MESSMATES ARNT YOU SATISFIED SO LONG AS THE ARTICLES YOU SIGNED ARE KEPT BY CAPTAIN AND CREW ASKED BILL MARLINE SOMEWHAT TARTLY WHY YES AS TO THAT MATTER BUT WHERE ARE WE BOUND BILL ASKED THE OTHER
3098-5407-0048 ANY BOY IN THE SHIP CAN MAKE OUT THE SEA WITCH'S COURSE SAID THE OLD TAR EVASIVELY WE'RE IN THESE HERE NORTHERN TRADES CLOSE HAULED AND HEADING ACCORDING TO MY RECKONING DUE EAST AND ANY MAN WHO HAS STOOD HIS TRICK AT THE WHEEL OF A SHIP
3098-5407-0049 KNOWS THAT SUCH A COURSE STEERED FROM THE WEST INDIES WILL IF WELL FOLLOWED RUN DOWN THE CAPE VERDS THAT'S ALL I KNOW PORT PRAYA AND A PORT THAT WAS IN THE ARTICLES SURE ENOUGH ANSWERED HE WHO HAD QUESTIONED BILL MARLINE
3098-5407-0050 BUT THE SEA WITCH WILL SCARCE ANCHOR THERE BEFORE SHE IS OFF AGAIN ACCORDING TO MY RECKONING THAT THE OLD TAR KNEW MORE THAN HE CHOSE TO DIVULGE HOWEVER WAS APPARENT TO HIS COMRADES BUT THEY KNEW HIM TO BE FIXED WHEN HE CHOSE
3098-5407-0051 AND SO DID NOT ENDEAVOR BY IMPORTUNITY TO GATHER ANYTHING FURTHER FROM HIM SO THE CONVERSATION GRADUALLY CHANGED INTO SOME OTHER CHANNEL IN THE MEANTIME WHILE THE CREW GATHERED ABOUT BILL MARLINE WERE THUS SPECULATING THE VESSEL BOWLED ALONG GRACEFULLY
3098-5407-0052 WITH A SPEED THAT WAS IN ITSELF EXHILARATING TO HER YOUNG COMMANDER WHO STILL GAZED IDLY AT THE PASSING CURRENT ONCE OR TWICE A SLIGHT FROWN CLOUDED HIS FEATURES AND HIS LIPS MOVED AS THOUGH HE WAS STRIVING WITHIN HIMSELF
3098-5407-0053 EITHER AGAINST REAL OR IMAGINARY EVIL AND THEN THE SAME CALM PLACID MANLINESS OF COUNTENANCE RADIATED HIS HANDSOME FEATURES AND HIS LIPS WERE COMPOSED
