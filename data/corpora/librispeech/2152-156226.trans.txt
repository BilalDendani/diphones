2152-156226-0000 PEGGY'S VISITORS AND FRANCIS RESOLUTION THE GIRLS WERE SOMEWHAT LATER IN RISING ON THE MORNING AFTER THE PARTY THAN USUAL
2152-156226-0001 AND WHEN THEY GOT UP THEY FOUND THAT PEGGY WAS OUT ON ONE OF THOSE ERRANDS THAT JANE AND ELSIE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO DO FOR HER
2152-156226-0002 FROM HER REAL SKILL AND PUNCTUALITY
2152-156226-0003 AND THIS WEEK SHE HAD HAD MORE WORK THAN SHE COULD MANAGE
2152-156226-0004 AND HAD BEEN KIND TO WILLIE WHEN HE WAS IN HIS LAST ILLNESS JANE SOMETIMES WITH AND SOMETIMES WITHOUT ELSIE HAD ALWAYS GONE TO TELL THIS WOMAN ABOUT THE WORK BUT ON THIS OCCASION PEGGY HAD TO TAKE THE LONG WALK HERSELF
2152-156226-0005 NOT THAT SHE GRUDGED IT FOR TO PUT HALF A CROWN IN POOR LIZZIE MARR'S POCKET WAS WORTH A GOOD DEAL OF TROUBLE AND FATIGUE
2152-156226-0006 SHE HAD RETURNED ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK WHEN THE GIRLS WERE GETTING READY TO JOIN THEIR COUSIN IN THEIR PROMISED WALK AND JUST AS SHE GOT TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRS A MAN'S FOOT WAS HEARD AT THE BOTTOM
2152-156226-0007 WHEN A SHARP TAP WAS HEARD AT THE DOOR AND PEGGY OPENED IT AND THEY BEHELD NOT FRANCIS BUT MISTER BRANDON

2152-156226-0014 GRANDFATHER EXPRESSED HIS SENSE OF THE POLITENESS OF MISTER BRANDON IN COMING ALL THAT WAY TO SEE PEGGY NOT BUT WHAT SHE WAS A GOOD LASS AND WORTH GOING A LONG JOURNEY TO HAVE A CRACK WITH

2152-156226-0018 I MUST GO BACK FOR I HAVE NOT MADE MY FORTUNE YET BUT BY THE BY IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT YOU LEFT MELBOURNE WHEN YOU DID
2152-156226-0019 ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT NOW BOUGHT A FLOCK AND RUN FOR AN OLD SONG
2152-156226-0020 IT WAS NOT TO BE SAID PEGGY CALMLY BUT HAS HE ANY BAIRNS TWO PEGGY AND HE IS VERY PROUD OF THEM AY AY A MAN HAS NEED TO BE PROUD AND PLEASED WITH HIS OWN AND THE WIFE
2152-156226-0021 OH SHE'S A NICE ENOUGH PERSON GETTING A LITTLE UPPISH NOW BUT NOT THE MANAGER YOU ARE SAID MISTER BRANDON
2152-156226-0022 THOUGH I DARE SAY HE HAS WRITTEN TO YOU ON THE SAME SUBJECT MY MAN OF BUSINESS SAID PEGGY WITH A LITTLE PRIDE I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HIM FOR A LONG TIME HE IS VERY SORRY INDEED THAT YOU LET THE TENANT HAVE A RIGHT OF PURCHASE TO YOUR SHOP
2152-156226-0023 IF HE BORROWS THE MONEY
2152-156226-0024 BUT THEY MUST JUST PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES
2152-156226-0025 BUT IN YOUR HANDS I HAVE NO DOUBT IT WILL BE TURNED TO GOOD ACCOUNT HERE COME THE BAIRNS NOW SAID PEGGY AS THE QUICK NOISY STEPS OF THE HEAVILY SHOD CHILDREN WERE HEARD CLATTERING UP THE STAIRS
2152-156226-0026 NAME THEM AS THEY COME IN TOM JAMIE NANCY JESSIE WILLIE A FINE LOT OF YOUNGSTERS UPON MY WORD AND SURE TO MAKE GOOD COLONISTS
2152-156226-0027 AND AS HE SAID THIS MISTER BRANDON SAW A TEAR STAND IN THE EYE OF THE DEVOTED AUNT AT HIS PRAISES OF HER ORPHAN CHARGE GOD BE PRAISED THEY HAVE THEIR HEALTH AND ON THE WHOLE THEY ARE GOOD BAIRNS THOUGH A THOUGHT NOISY WHILES
2152-156226-0028 SAID SHE THERE'S A GENTLEMAN AT THE STAIRFOOT SAID TOM HE SAYS HE HAS COME FOR YOU AND YOUR SISTER MISS MELVILLE AND AS IT WAS OUR DINNER TIME HE WOULD NOT COME UP
2152-156226-0029 AND BE SURE TO BE IN TIME FOR THE SCHOOL
2152-156226-0030 AND THEN THEY WENT FOR A WALK BY DAYLIGHT HE WAS STRUCK MORE WITH THE CHANGE THAT HAD SHOWN ITSELF IN BOTH OF HIS COUSINS
2152-156226-0031 JANE'S PROPOSAL ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT TO GO TO MISSUS DUNN'S HAD DISTRESSED HIM MORE THAN ANY OTHER OF HER PROJECTS AND YET HE COULD DO NOTHING TO PREVENT IT UNLESS BY MAKING THE SACRIFICE WHICH MY YOUNG LADY READERS THINK HE SHOULD HAVE MADE
2152-156226-0032 LONG AGO AND GIVEN UP THE ESTATE TO MARRY HIS COUSIN ALL FOR LOVE
2152-156226-0033 IS A FASCINATING COURSE OF PROCEDURE IN BOOKS AND ON THE STAGE
2152-156226-0034 IT WAS ONLY LATELY THAT FRANCIS HAD DISCOVERED HOW VERY DEAR JANE WAS TO HIM
2152-156226-0035 WITH ANY REASONABLE CHANCE OF OBTAINING HER HE WOULD HAVE EXERTED EVERY EFFORT AND MADE EVERY SACRIFICE TO GAIN SUCH A COMPANION FOR LIFE HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN UP ALL HIS MORE EXPENSIVE BACHELOR HABITS HIS BOOK BUYING
2152-156226-0036 AND HIS PUBLIC AMUSEMENTS AND THOUGHT DOMESTIC HAPPINESS CHEAPLY PURCHASED BY SUCH PRIVATIONS AND IF JANE COULD HAVE SHARED HIS BRIGHTER FORTUNE
2152-156226-0037 HE WOULD HAVE OFFERED HIS HAND AND HEART LONG BEFORE BUT NOW EVEN SUPPOSING THAT HE HAD CONTRACTED NO EXPENSIVE HABITS AND HE FOUND THAT HE HAD THAT HE LIKED THE HANDSOME FORTUNE AND THE LUXURIES ANNEXED TO IT
2152-156226-0038 IT WAS NOT HIS OWN PERSONAL GRATIFICATION THAT HE WAS REQUIRED TO GIVE UP
2152-156226-0039 HIS PLACE AT THE BANK OF SCOTLAND WAS FILLED UP
2152-156226-0040 AND HE MUST PREPARE NOT ONLY FOR PROVIDING FOR A WIFE AND FAMILY BUT FOR ELSIE TOO AND UNTIL THIS DAY ELSIE HAD SHRUNK FROM HIM AND HE HAD RATHER DESPISED HER BUT DURING THEIR WALK HE SAW THE AFFECTIONATE AND SINCERE NATURE OF JANE'S SISTER
2152-156226-0041 HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD NOT ONLY OFFER HER A HOME BUT THAT HE HAD SOME PROSPECT OF MAKING IT A HAPPY ONE WHICH IS BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN SUCH MATTERS AND HE GRADUALLY BROUGHT HIMSELF TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS RIGHT
2152-156226-0042 HE SHOULD MAKE THE SACRIFICE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES OF USEFULNESS MIGHT OPEN THEMSELVES IN SOME OTHER SPHERE HE WOULD GIVE UP CROSS HALL TO THE BENEVOLENT SOCIETIES IF JANE WOULD ONLY CONSENT TO BE HIS WIFE THE COUSINSHIP HE THOUGHT NO OBJECTION
2152-156226-0043 AND AS UNLIKE EACH OTHER IN TEMPERAMENT AND CONSTITUTION AS IF THEY WERE NOT RELATED NEITHER JANE NOR ELSIE WAS LIKELY TO KEEP HER HEALTH AT A SEDENTARY EMPLOYMENT IT WAS THE DAILY LONG WALK THAT HAD KEPT THEM SO WELL
2152-156226-0044 THAT HE KNEW TO BE HER GREATEST COMFORT AND HIS OWN MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSION BUT SHE COULD NOT SHE WOULD NOT REFUSE HIM HE SAW THE KIND LOOK OF HER EYES AND FELT CONVINCED THAT THOUGH JANE BELIEVED IT WAS ONLY FRIENDSHIP
2152-156226-0045 THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE WAS ALL THE WORLD TO HIM WOULD CHANGE IT INTO LOVE AND THEN TO BEGIN LIFE AFRESH NO LONGER SOLITARY NO LONGER UNLOVED
