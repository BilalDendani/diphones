5570-73847-0000 THE LAST LIGHT OF SUNSET LAY IN THE WEST AND A SULLEN WRACK OF CLOUD WAS MOUNTING INTO THE WINDLESS SKY
5570-73847-0001 THE OLD STONE CHURCH WITH ITS SQUARE TOWER STOOD AMID TREES ITS EASTERN WINDOW FAINTLY AGLOW WITH CRIMSON AND PURPLE
5570-73847-0002 A FACE WAS LIFTED IN HIS DIRECTION AND UNDISCONCERTED EYES CALMLY SURVEYED HIM I AM AFRAID
5570-73847-0003 NOT AT ALL NOT AT ALL SAID THE STRANGER I HAVE NO PRIVILEGES HERE AT LEAST AS YET LAWFORD AGAIN HESITATED THEN SLOWLY ADVANCED IT'S ASTONISHINGLY QUIET AND BEAUTIFUL HE SAID
5570-73847-0004 THE STRANGER TURNED HIS HEAD TO GLANCE OVER THE FIELDS YES IT IS VERY HE REPLIED THERE WAS THE FAINTEST ACCENT A LITTLE DRAWL OF UNFRIENDLINESS IN THE REMARK YOU OFTEN SIT HERE LAWFORD PERSISTED
5570-73847-0005 THE STRANGER RAISED HIS EYEBROWS OH YES OFTEN HE SMILED IT IS MY OWN MODEST FASHION OF ATTENDING DIVINE SERVICE THE CONGREGATION IS RAPT MY VISITS SAID LAWFORD HAVE BEEN VERY FEW
5570-73847-0006 TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH HE REPLIED PICKING HIS WAY AS IT WERE FROM WORD TO WORD IT'S HISTORY AS PEOPLE CALL IT DOES NOT INTEREST ME IN THE LEAST AFTER ALL IT'S NOT WHEN A THING IS BUT WHAT IT IS THAT MUCH MATTERS
5570-73847-0007 HE GLANCED WITH HEAD BENT ACROSS THE SHADOWY STONES IS PRETTY EVIDENT OF COURSE AGE HAS ITS CHARMS AND IS THIS VERY OLD OH YES IT'S OLD RIGHT ENOUGH AS THINGS GO
5570-73847-0008 BUT EVEN AGE PERHAPS IS MAINLY AN AFFAIR OF THE IMAGINATION THERE'S A TOMBSTONE NEAR THAT LITTLE OLD HAWTHORN AND THERE ARE TWO OTHERS SIDE BY SIDE UNDER THE WALL STILL EVEN LEGIBLY LATE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
5570-73847-0009 THAT'S PRETTY GOOD WEATHERING HE SMILED FAINTLY OF COURSE THE CHURCH ITSELF IS CENTURIES OLDER DRENCHED WITH AGE BUT SHE'S STILL SLEEP WALKING WHILE THESE OLD TOMBSTONES DREAM GLOW WORMS AND CRICKETS ARE NOT SUCH BAD BEDFELLOWS
5570-73847-0010 WHAT INTERESTED ME MOST I THINK SAID LAWFORD HALTINGLY WAS THIS HE POINTED WITH HIS STICK TO THE GRAVE AT HIS FEET AH YES SABATHIER'S SAID THE STRANGER
5570-73847-0011 I KNOW HIS PECULIAR HISTORY ALMOST BY HEART LAWFORD FOUND HIMSELF STARING WITH UNUSUAL CONCENTRATION INTO THE RATHER LONG AND PALE FACE NOT I SUPPOSE HE RESUMED FAINTLY
5570-73847-0012 EVEN IF YOU DON'T A SUICIDE SAID LAWFORD UNDER HIS BREATH YES A SUICIDE THAT'S WHY OUR CHRISTIAN COUNTRYMEN HAVE BURIED HIM OUTSIDE OF THE FOLD DEAD OR ALIVE THEY TRY TO KEEP THE WOLF OUT
5570-73847-0013 IS THIS THEN UNCONSECRATED GROUND SAID LAWFORD HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED DRAWLED THE OTHER HOW GREEN THE GRASS GROWS DOWN HERE AND HOW VERY SHARP ARE POOR OLD SABATHIER'S THORNS
5570-73847-0014 BESIDES HE WAS A STRANGER AND THEY KEPT HIM OUT BUT SURELY SAID LAWFORD WAS IT SO ENTIRELY A MATTER OF CHOICE THE LAWS OF THE CHURCH IF HE DID KILL HIMSELF HE DID
5570-73847-0015 HAS ANYTHING EVER OCCURRED OCCURRED HE RAISED HIS EYEBROWS I WISH IT HAD I COME HERE SIMPLY AS I HAVE SAID BECAUSE IT'S QUIET BECAUSE I PREFER THE COMPANY OF THOSE WHO NEVER ANSWER ME BACK
5570-73847-0016 IT IS POSSIBLE ONE EVER COULD ONE EVER COULD ANSWER BACK THERE WAS A LOW ROTTING WALL OF STONE ENCOMPASSING SABATHIER'S GRAVE ON THIS THE STRANGER SAT DOWN
5570-73847-0017 HE GLANCED UP RATHER CURIOUSLY AT HIS COMPANION SELDOM THE TIME AND THE PLACE AND THE REVENANT ALTOGETHER
5570-73847-0018 HE VENTURED TO ADD OF COURSE OF COURSE SAID LAWFORD EAGERLY BUT IT IS AN ABSOLUTELY NEW ONE TO ME I DON'T MEAN THAT I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH AN IDEA JUST IN ONE'S OWN SUPERFICIAL WAY BUT'
5570-73847-0019 ALL QUITE DEAD CALL AND SEE TAUNTED THE STRANGER SOFTLY AH YES I KNOW SAID LAWFORD BUT I BELIEVE IN THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY THAT IS WHAT WE SAY
5570-73847-0020 AND SUPPOSING WHEN A MAN DIES SUPPOSING IT WAS MOST FRIGHTFULLY AGAINST ONE'S WILL THAT ONE HATED THE AWFUL INACTION THAT DEATH BRINGS SHUTTING A POOR DEVIL UP LIKE A CHILD KICKING AGAINST THE DOOR IN A DARK CUPBOARD
5570-73847-0021 ONE MIGHT SURELY ONE MIGHT JUST QUIETLY YOU KNOW TRY TO GET OUT WOULDN'T YOU HE ADDED AND SURELY HE FOUND HIMSELF BEGINNING GENTLY TO ARGUE AGAIN
5570-73847-0022 HE NODDED TOWARDS THE OLD AND BROKEN GRAVE THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM WHAT SABATHIER THE OTHER ECHOED LAYING HIS HAND UPON THE STONE AND A SHEER ENORMOUS ABYSS OF SILENCE SEEMED TO FOLLOW THE UNANSWERABLE QUESTION
5570-73847-0023 HE WAS A STRANGER IT SAYS SO GOOD GOD SAID LAWFORD
5570-73847-0024 HE KILLED HIMSELF POOR WRETCH THINK OF THE FRET AND FEVER HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN JUST BEFORE IMAGINE IT BUT IT MIGHT YOU KNOW SUGGESTED THE OTHER WITH A SMILE
5570-73847-0025 NICHOLAS SABATHIER STRANGER TO THIS PARISH NO NO SAID LAWFORD HIS HEART BEATING AS IF IT WOULD CHOKE HIM I DON'T FANCY IT WAS INDIFFERENCE IT WAS ALMOST TOO DARK NOW TO DISTINGUISH THE STRANGER'S FEATURES
5570-73847-0026 IT'S NARROW QUARTERS HOW WOULD HE BEGIN LAWFORD SAT QUITE STILL YOU SAY I HOPE I AM NOT DETAINING YOU YOU SAY YOU HAVE COME HERE SAT HERE OFTEN ON THIS VERY SEAT HAVE YOU EVER HAD
5570-73847-0027 MILK PALE IN THE RISING MOON THE STRANGER TURNED AWAY FROM HIM FOR IN THAT SLEEP OF DEATH WHAT DREAMS MAY COME MUST GIVE US PAUSE HE SAID SLOWLY WITH A LITTLE SATIRICAL CATCH ON THE LAST WORD WHAT DID YOU DREAM
5570-73847-0028 LAWFORD GLANCED HELPLESSLY ABOUT HIM THE MOON CAST LEAN GREY BEAMS OF LIGHT BETWEEN THE CYPRESSES BUT TO HIS WIDE AND WANDERING EYES IT SEEMED THAT A RADIANCE OTHER THAN HERS HAUNTED THESE MOUNDS AND LEANING STONES
5570-73847-0029 HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED IT HE SAID PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TOWARDS HIS UNKNOWN COMPANION THIS STONE IS CRACKED FROM HEAD TO FOOT BUT THERE' HE ROSE STIFF AND CHILLED
5570-73847-0030 YOU CAME HERE FOR SOLITUDE AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU THAT WE ARE SURROUNDED WITH WITNESSES YOU WILL FORGIVE MY INTRUSION THERE WAS A KIND OF OLD FASHIONED COURTESY IN HIS MANNER THAT HE HIMSELF WAS DIMLY AWARE OF HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
5570-73847-0031 IT'S THE OLD STORY OF BLUEBEARD AND I CONFESS I TOO SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE A PEEP INTO HIS CUPBOARD WHO WOULDN'T BUT THERE IT'S MERELY A MATTER OF TIME I SUPPOSE HE PAUSED
5570-73847-0032 AND TOGETHER THEY SLOWLY ASCENDED THE PATH ALREADY GLIMMERING WITH A HEAVY DEW AT THE PORCH THEY PAUSED ONCE MORE AND NOW IT WAS THE STRANGER THAT HELD OUT HIS HAND PERHAPS HE SAID YOU WILL GIVE ME THE PLEASURE OF SOME DAY CONTINUING OUR TALK
5570-73847-0033 AS FOR OUR FRIEND BELOW IT SO HAPPENS THAT I HAVE MANAGED TO PICK UP A LITTLE MORE OF HIS HISTORY THAN THE SEXTON SEEMS TO HAVE HEARD OF
5570-73847-0034 I THINK YOU WOULD AGREE THAT MINE IS EVEN BUT THERE I'VE TALKED TOO MUCH ABOUT MYSELF ALREADY PERHAPS TO MORROW WHY TO MORROW THEN SAID HIS COMPANION IT'S A FLAT WOODEN HOUSE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE COME AT ANY TIME OF THE EVENING
5570-73847-0035 HE PAUSED AGAIN AND SMILED THIRD HOUSE AFTER THE RECTORY WHICH IS MARKED UP ON THE GATE MY NAME IS HERBERT HERBERT HERBERT TO BE PRECISE LAWFORD TOOK OUT HIS POCKET BOOK AND A CARD MINE HE SAID HANDING IT GRAVELY TO HIS COMPANION
5570-73847-0036 IS LAWFORD AT LEAST IT WAS REALLY THE FIRST TIME THAT EITHER HAD SEEN THE OTHER'S FACE AT CLOSE QUARTERS AND CLEAR LIT AND ON LAWFORD'S A MOON ALMOST AT THE FULL SHONE DAZZLINGLY HE SAW AN EXPRESSION
5570-73847-0037 DISMAY INCREDULITY OVERWHELMING ASTONISHMENT START SUDDENLY INTO THE DARK RATHER INDIFFERENT EYES WHAT IS IT HE CRIED HASTILY STOOPING CLOSE
