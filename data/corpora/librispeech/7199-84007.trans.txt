7199-84007-0000 FOR HER CRUEL UNCLE GUNDEBALD WAGING WAR AGAINST HIS BROTHER CHILPERIC THE RIGHTFUL KING OF BURGUNDY HAD WITH A BAND OF SAVAGE FOLLOWERS BURST INTO HIS BROTHER'S PALACE AND AFTER THE FIERCE AND RELENTLESS FASHION OF THOSE CRUEL DAYS
7199-84007-0001 HAD MURDERED KING CHILPERIC THE FATHER OF LITTLE CLOTILDA THE QUEEN HER MOTHER
7199-84007-0002 AND WAS NOW SEARCHING FOR HER AND HER SISTER SEDELENDA TO KILL THEM ALSO POOR SEDELENDA HAD HIDDEN AWAY IN SOME OTHER FAR OFF CORNER BUT EVEN AS CLOTILDA HUNG FOR PROTECTION TO THE ROBE
7199-84007-0003 ON HIS HOMEWARD JOURNEY FROM JERUSALEM
7199-84007-0004 NOT ONE OF THE TYRANT'S BROOD SHALL LIVE I SAY IT AND WHO ART THOU TO JUDGE OF LIFE OR DEATH DEMANDED THE PRIEST STERNLY AS HE STILL SHIELDED THE TREMBLING CHILD I AM GUNDEBALD
7199-84007-0005 KING OF BURGUNDY BY THE GRACE OF MINE OWN GOOD SWORD AND THE RIGHT OF SUCCESSION WAS THE REPLY TRIFLE NOT WITH ME SIR PRIEST BUT THRUST AWAY THE CHILD SHE IS MY LAWFUL PRIZE TO DO WITH AS I WILL HO SIGEBERT
7199-84007-0006 DRAG HER FORTH QUICK AS A FLASH THE BRAVE PRIEST STEPPED BEFORE THE COWERING CHILD
7199-84007-0007 HE RAISED THE OTHER IN STERN AND FEARLESS PROTEST AND BOLDLY FACED THE MURDEROUS THRONG BACK MEN OF BLOOD HE CRIED BACK
7199-84007-0008 WHEN EXTENDED TO PERSONS IN PERIL WAS CALLED THE RIGHT OF SANCTUARY
7199-84007-0009 HER SISTER SEDELENDA HAD FOUND REFUGE AND SAFETY IN THE CONVENT OF AINAY NEAR AT HAND AND THERE TOO CLOTILDA WOULD HAVE GONE BUT HER UNCLE THE NEW KING SAID NO THE MAIDENS MUST BE FOREVER SEPARATED
7199-84007-0010 HE EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS HOWEVER TO HAVE THE PRINCESS CLOTILDA BROUGHT UP IN HIS PALACE WHICH HAD BEEN HER FATHER'S
7199-84007-0011 TO REMAIN AWHILE AND LOOK AFTER THE GIRL'S EDUCATION IN THOSE DAYS A KING'S REQUEST WAS A COMMAND AND THE GOOD UGO THOUGH STERN AND BRAVE IN THE FACE OF REAL DANGER
7199-84007-0012 SO HE CONTINUED IN THE PALACE OF THE KING LOOKING AFTER THE WELFARE OF HIS LITTLE CHARGE UNTIL SUDDENLY THE GIRL TOOK MATTERS INTO HER OWN HANDS AND DECIDED HIS FUTURE AND HER OWN
7199-84007-0013 IT WAS A LAND OF FOREST AND VINEYARDS OF FAIR VALLEYS AND SHELTERED HILL SIDES AND OF BUSY CITIES THAT THE FOSTERING HAND OF ROME HAD BEAUTIFIED WHILE THROUGH ITS BROAD DOMAIN THE RHONE
7199-84007-0014 PURE AND SPARKLING SWEPT WITH A RAPID CURRENT FROM SWISS LAKE AND GLACIER SOUTHWARD TO THE BROAD AND BEAUTIFUL MEDITERRANEAN LYONS WAS ITS CAPITAL AND ON THE HILL OF FOURVIERE OVERLOOKING THE CITY BELOW IT
7199-84007-0015 ROSE THE MARBLE PALACE OF THE BURGUNDIAN KINGS NEAR TO THE SPOT WHERE TO DAY THE RUINED FORUM OF THE OLD ROMAN DAYS IS STILL SHOWN TO TOURISTS IT HAD BEEN A PALACE FOR CENTURIES ROMAN GOVERNORS OF IMPERIAL GAUL
7199-84007-0016 HAD MADE IT THEIR HEAD QUARTERS AND THEIR HOME THREE ROMAN EMPERORS HAD COOED AND CRIED AS BABIES WITHIN ITS WALLS AND IT HAD WITNESSED ALSO MANY A FEAST AND FORAY AND THE CHANGING FORTUNES OF ROMAN GALLIC AND BURGUNDIAN CONQUERORS AND OVER LORDS
7199-84007-0017 BUT IT WAS NO LONGER HOME TO THE LITTLE PRINCESS CLOTILDA SHE THOUGHT OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER AND OF HER BROTHERS THE LITTLE PRINCES WITH WHOM SHE HAD PLAYED IN THIS VERY PALACE AS IT NOW SEEMED TO HER SO MANY YEARS AGO
7199-84007-0018 AND THE MORE SHE FEARED HER CRUEL UNCLE THE MORE DID SHE DESIRE TO GO FAR FAR AWAY FROM HIS PRESENCE SO AFTER THINKING THE WHOLE MATTER OVER AS LITTLE GIRLS OF TEN CAN SOMETIMES THINK SHE TOLD HER GOOD FRIEND UGO
7199-84007-0019 WHO LIVED IN THE PRIEST'S OWN BOYHOOD HOME OF TOURNAY IN FAR OFF BELGIUM AND WHO THOUGH SO BRAVE AND DARING WAS STILL A PAGAN WHEN ALL THE WORLD WAS FAST BECOMING CHRISTIAN AND AS CLOTILDA LISTENED
7199-84007-0020 SHE WISHED THAT SHE COULD TURN THIS BRAVE YOUNG CHIEF AWAY FROM HIS HEATHEN DEITIES THOR AND ODIN
7199-84007-0021 AND REVOLVING STRANGE FANCIES IN HER MIND SHE DETERMINED WHAT SHE WOULD DO WHEN SHE GREW UP AS MANY A GIRL SINCE HER DAY HAS DETERMINED BUT EVEN AS THEY REACHED THE FAIR CITY OF GENEVA THEN HALF ROMAN HALF GALLIC IN ITS BUILDINGS AND ITS LIFE
7199-84007-0022 HOW THIS BOY KING CLOVIS SENDING A CHALLENGE TO COMBAT TO THE PREFECT SYAGRIUS THE LAST OF THE ROMAN GOVERNORS
7199-84007-0023 AT SOISSONS AND BROKEN FOREVER THE POWER OF ROME IN GAUL WAR WHICH IS NEVER ANY THING BUT TERRIBLE WAS DOUBLY SO IN THOSE SAVAGE DAYS AND THE PLUNDER OF THE CAPTURED CITIES AND HOMESTEADS
7199-84007-0024 THE DESIRE TO CONVERT HIM FROM PAGANISM AND TO REVENGE HER FATHER'S MURDER TOOK SHAPE IN HER MIND FOR
7199-84007-0025 FOURTEEN CENTURIES OF PROGRESS AND EDUCATION HAVE MADE US MORE LOVING AND LESS VINDICTIVE
7199-84007-0026 KING GUNDEBALD DECLINED LONGER TO SHELTER HIS NIECE IN HIS PALACE AT GENEVA AND WHY MAY I NOT GO WITH YOU THE GIRL ASKED OF UGO BUT THE OLD PRIEST KNEW THAT A CONQUERED AND PLUNDERED LAND WAS NO PLACE TO WHICH TO CONVEY A YOUNG MAID FOR SAFETY
7199-84007-0027 AND THE PRINCESS THEREFORE FOUND REFUGE AMONG THE SISTERS OF THE CHURCH OF SAINT PETER IN GENEVA AND HERE SHE PASSED HER GIRLHOOD AS THE RECORD SAYS IN WORKS OF PIETY AND CHARITY
7199-84007-0028 THE YOUNG GIRL BROUGHT THE PILGRIM FOOD AND THEN ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF THE DAY KNEELING ON THE EARTHEN FLOOR SHE BEGAN TO BATHE HIS FEET BUT AS SHE DID SO THE PILGRIM BENDING FORWARD SAID IN A LOW VOICE LADY
7199-84007-0029 OF THE SAD CONDITION OF ONE WHO IS THE DAUGHTER OF A ROYAL LINE HE BADE ME USE ALL MY WIT TO COME NIGH TO THEE AND TO SAY THAT IF IT BE THE WILL OF THE GODS HE WOULD FAIN RAISE THEE TO HIS RANK BY MARRIAGE
7199-84007-0030 CAME INTO THE GIRL'S MIND AND THAT AS THE RECORD STATES SHE ACCEPTED THE RING WITH GREAT JOY RETURN PROMPTLY TO THY LORD SHE SAID TO THE MESSENGER AND BID HIM IF HE WOULD FAIN UNITE ME TO HIM IN MARRIAGE
7199-84007-0031 TO SEND MESSENGERS WITHOUT DELAY TO DEMAND ME OF MY UNCLE KING GUNDEBALD AND LET THOSE SAME MESSENGERS TAKE ME AWAY IN HASTE SO SOON AS THEY SHALL HAVE OBTAINED PERMISSION FOR THIS WISE YOUNG PRINCESS KNEW
7199-84007-0032 THAT HER UNCLE'S WORD WAS NOT TO BE LONG DEPENDED UPON AND SHE FEARED TOO THAT CERTAIN ADVISERS AT HER UNCLE'S COURT MIGHT COUNSEL HIM TO DO HER HARM BEFORE THE MESSENGERS OF KING CLOVIS COULD HAVE CONDUCTED HER BEYOND THE BORDERS OF BURGUNDY AURELIAN
7199-84007-0033 THAT WE MAY TAKE HER TO KING CLOVIS WHO WAITETH FOR US EVEN NOW AT CHALONS TO CONCLUDE THESE NUPTIALS SO ALMOST BEFORE HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING KING GUNDEBALD HAD BIDDEN HIS NIECE FAREWELL
7199-84007-0034 SHREWD YOUNG PRINCESS SHE KNEW HER UNCLE THE KING OF BURGUNDY TOO WELL WHEN ONCE HE WAS ROUSED TO ACTION HE WAS FIERCE AND FURIOUS GOOD AURELIAN
7199-84007-0035 WHO RODE BY HER SIDE IF THAT THOU WOULDST TAKE ME INTO THE PRESENCE OF THY LORD THE KING OF THE FRANKS LET ME DESCEND FROM THIS CARRIAGE MOUNT ME ON HORSEBACK AND LET US SPEED HENCE AS FAST AS WE MAY
7199-84007-0036 FOR NEVER IN THIS CARRIAGE SHALL I REACH THE PRESENCE OF MY LORD THE KING AND NONE TOO SOON WAS HER ADVICE ACTED UPON FOR THE COUNSELLORS OF KING GUNDEBALD
7199-84007-0037 CONCLUDED THAT AFTER ALL THEY HAD MADE A MISTAKE IN BETROTHING HER TO KING CLOVIS THOU SHOULDST HAVE REMEMBERED MY LORD THEY SAID THAT THOU DIDST SLAY CLOTILDA'S FATHER HER MOTHER AND THE YOUNG PRINCES HER BROTHERS
7199-84007-0038 WHERE IN THE CAMPANIA OR PLAIN COUNTRY LATER KNOWN AS THE PROVINCE OF CHAMPAGNE SHE MET THE KING OF THE FRANKS I AM SORRY TO BE OBLIGED TO CONFESS
7199-84007-0039 THAT THE FIRST RECORDED DESIRE OF THIS BEAUTIFUL BRAVE AND DEVOUT YOUNG MAIDEN WHEN SHE FOUND HERSELF SAFELY AMONG THE FIERCE FOLLOWERS OF KING CLOVIS WAS A REQUEST FOR VENGEANCE BUT WE MUST REMEMBER GIRLS AND BOYS
7199-84007-0040 YOUNG CLOVIS IN A DRESS OF CRIMSON AND GOLD AND MILK WHITE SILK AND WITH HIS YELLOW HAIR COILED IN A GREAT TOP KNOT ON HIS UNCOVERED HEAD ADVANCED TO MEET HIS BRIDE MY LORD KING SAID CLOTILDA
7199-84007-0041 THE BANDS OF THE KING OF BURGUNDY FOLLOW HARD UPON US TO BEAR ME OFF COMMAND I PRAY THEE THAT THESE MY ESCORT SCATTER THEMSELVES RIGHT AND LEFT FOR TWOSCORE MILES
7199-84007-0042 AND PLUNDER AND BURN THE LANDS OF THE KING OF BURGUNDY PROBABLY IN NO OTHER WAY COULD THIS WISE YOUNG GIRL OF SEVENTEEN HAVE SO THOROUGHLY PLEASED THE FIERCE AND WARLIKE YOUNG KING HE GLADLY ORDERED HER WISHES TO BE CARRIED OUT
7199-84007-0043 MEANING THE BRILLIANT AND NOBLE MAID IN SPITE OF THE WICKED UNCLE GUNDEBALD WERE MARRIED AT SOISSONS
7199-84007-0044 AND AS THE FAIRY STORIES SAY
7199-84007-0045 THE RECORD OF THEIR LATER YEARS HAS NO PLACE IN THIS SKETCH OF THE GIRLHOOD OF CLOTILDA BUT IT IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND DRAMATIC OF THE OLD TIME HISTORIC STORIES
7199-84007-0046 TO MAKE HER BOY HERO A CHRISTIAN AND TO BE REVENGED ON THE MURDERER OF HER PARENTS WAS IN TIME FULFILLED
7199-84007-0047 IN THE DAYS WHEN PASSION INSTEAD OF LOVE RULED THE HEARTS OF MEN AND WOMEN AND OF BOYS AND GIRLS AS WELL AND HOW FAVORED ARE WE OF THIS NINETEENTH CENTURY IN ALL THE PEACE AND PROSPERITY AND HOME HAPPINESS THAT SURROUND US
7199-84007-0048 HE BROUGHT ALL THE LAND UNDER HIS SWAY FROM THE RHINE TO THE RHONE THE OCEAN AND THE PYRENEES HE WAS HAILED BY HIS PEOPLE WITH THE OLD ROMAN TITLES OF CONSUL AND AUGUSTUS
7199-84007-0049 CLOTILDA AFTER YEARS OF WISE COUNSEL AND CHARITABLE WORKS UPON WHICH HER DETERMINATION FOR REVENGE SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY STAIN
7199-84007-0050 A TYPICAL GIRL OF THOSE HARSH OLD DAYS OF THE LONG AGO LOVING AND GENEROUS TOWARD HER FRIENDS UNFORGIVING AND REVENGEFUL TO HER ENEMIES REARED IN THE MIDST OF CRUELTY AND OF CHARITY SHE DID HER DUTY ACCORDING TO THE LIGHT GIVEN HER
7199-84007-0051 MADE FRANCE A CHRISTIAN NATION AND SO HELPED ON THE PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION
