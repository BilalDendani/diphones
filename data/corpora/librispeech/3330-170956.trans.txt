3330-170956-0000 HERE ADEIMANTUS INTERPOSED A QUESTION HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER SOCRATES SAID HE IF A PERSON WERE TO SAY THAT YOU ARE MAKING THESE PEOPLE MISERABLE AND THAT THEY ARE THE CAUSE OF THEIR OWN UNHAPPINESS
3330-170956-0001 THE CITY IN FACT BELONGS TO THEM BUT THEY ARE NONE THE BETTER FOR IT WHEREAS OTHER MEN ACQUIRE LANDS AND BUILD LARGE AND HANDSOME HOUSES AND HAVE EVERYTHING HANDSOME ABOUT THEM OFFERING SACRIFICES TO THE GODS ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT
3330-170956-0002 AND PRACTISING HOSPITALITY MOREOVER AS YOU WERE SAYING JUST NOW THEY HAVE GOLD AND SILVER AND ALL THAT IS USUAL AMONG THE FAVOURITES OF FORTUNE BUT OUR POOR CITIZENS ARE NO BETTER THAN MERCENARIES WHO ARE QUARTERED IN THE CITY
3330-170956-0003 AND ARE ALWAYS MOUNTING GUARD YES I SAID AND YOU MAY ADD THAT THEY ARE ONLY FED AND NOT PAID IN ADDITION TO THEIR FOOD LIKE OTHER MEN AND THEREFORE THEY CANNOT IF THEY WOULD TAKE A JOURNEY OF PLEASURE
3330-170956-0004 THEY HAVE NO MONEY TO SPEND ON A MISTRESS OR ANY OTHER LUXURIOUS FANCY WHICH AS THE WORLD GOES IS THOUGHT TO BE HAPPINESS AND MANY OTHER ACCUSATIONS OF THE SAME NATURE MIGHT BE ADDED BUT
3330-170956-0005 YOU MEAN TO ASK I SAID WHAT WILL BE OUR ANSWER YES IF WE PROCEED ALONG THE OLD PATH MY BELIEF I SAID IS THAT WE SHALL FIND THE ANSWER AND OUR ANSWER WILL BE THAT
3330-170956-0006 EVEN AS THEY ARE OUR GUARDIANS MAY VERY LIKELY BE THE HAPPIEST OF MEN BUT THAT OUR AIM IN FOUNDING THE STATE WAS NOT THE DISPROPORTIONATE HAPPINESS OF ANY ONE CLASS BUT THE GREATEST HAPPINESS OF THE WHOLE
3330-170956-0007 WE THOUGHT THAT IN A STATE WHICH IS ORDERED WITH A VIEW TO THE GOOD OF THE WHOLE WE SHOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO FIND JUSTICE AND IN THE ILL ORDERED STATE INJUSTICE AND HAVING FOUND THEM
3330-170956-0008 WE MIGHT THEN DECIDE WHICH OF THE TWO IS THE HAPPIER AT PRESENT I TAKE IT WE ARE FASHIONING THE HAPPY STATE NOT PIECEMEAL OR WITH A VIEW OF MAKING A FEW HAPPY CITIZENS BUT AS A WHOLE
3330-170956-0009 AND BY AND BY WE WILL PROCEED TO VIEW THE OPPOSITE KIND OF STATE SUPPOSE THAT WE WERE PAINTING A STATUE AND SOME ONE CAME UP TO US AND SAID
3330-170956-0010 WHETHER BY GIVING THIS AND THE OTHER FEATURES THEIR DUE PROPORTION WE MAKE THE WHOLE BEAUTIFUL AND SO I SAY TO YOU DO NOT COMPEL US TO ASSIGN TO THE GUARDIANS A SORT OF HAPPINESS WHICH WILL MAKE THEM ANYTHING BUT GUARDIANS
3330-170956-0011 WHILE THEIR WHEEL IS CONVENIENTLY AT HAND AND WORKING AT POTTERY ONLY AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE IN THIS WAY WE MIGHT MAKE EVERY CLASS HAPPY AND THEN AS YOU IMAGINE THE WHOLE STATE WOULD BE HAPPY
3330-170956-0012 BUT DO NOT PUT THIS IDEA INTO OUR HEADS FOR IF WE LISTEN TO YOU THE HUSBANDMAN WILL BE NO LONGER A HUSBANDMAN THE POTTER WILL CEASE TO BE A POTTER
3330-170956-0013 AND NO ONE WILL HAVE THE CHARACTER OF ANY DISTINCT CLASS IN THE STATE NOW THIS IS NOT OF MUCH CONSEQUENCE WHERE THE CORRUPTION OF SOCIETY
3330-170956-0014 WE MEAN OUR GUARDIANS TO BE TRUE SAVIOURS AND NOT THE DESTROYERS OF THE STATE WHEREAS OUR OPPONENT IS THINKING OF PEASANTS AT A FESTIVAL WHO ARE ENJOYING A LIFE OF REVELRY NOT OF CITIZENS WHO ARE DOING THEIR DUTY TO THE STATE
3330-170956-0015 BUT IF SO WE MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS AND HE IS SPEAKING OF SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT A STATE AND THEREFORE WE MUST CONSIDER WHETHER IN APPOINTING OUR GUARDIANS WE WOULD LOOK TO THEIR GREATEST HAPPINESS INDIVIDUALLY
3330-170956-0016 OR WHETHER THIS PRINCIPLE OF HAPPINESS DOES NOT RATHER RESIDE IN THE STATE AS A WHOLE BUT IF THE LATTER BE THE TRUTH THEN THE GUARDIANS AND AUXILIARIES AND ALL OTHERS EQUALLY WITH THEM
3330-170956-0017 I THINK THAT YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT I WONDER WHETHER YOU WILL AGREE WITH ANOTHER REMARK WHICH OCCURS TO ME WHAT MAY THAT BE THERE SEEM TO BE TWO CAUSES OF THE DETERIORATION OF THE ARTS WHAT ARE THEY
3330-170956-0018 WEALTH I SAID AND POVERTY HOW DO THEY ACT THE PROCESS IS AS FOLLOWS WHEN A POTTER BECOMES RICH WILL HE THINK YOU ANY LONGER TAKE THE SAME PAINS WITH HIS ART
3330-170956-0019 CERTAINLY NOT HE WILL GROW MORE AND MORE INDOLENT AND CARELESS VERY TRUE AND THE RESULT WILL BE THAT HE BECOMES A WORSE POTTER YES HE GREATLY DETERIORATES BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
3330-170956-0020 IF HE HAS NO MONEY AND CANNOT PROVIDE HIMSELF WITH TOOLS OR INSTRUMENTS HE WILL NOT WORK EQUALLY WELL HIMSELF NOR WILL HE TEACH HIS SONS OR APPRENTICES TO WORK EQUALLY WELL CERTAINLY NOT
3330-170956-0021 WORKMEN AND THEIR WORK ARE EQUALLY LIABLE TO DEGENERATE THAT IS EVIDENT HERE THEN IS A DISCOVERY OF NEW EVILS I SAID AGAINST WHICH THE GUARDIANS WILL HAVE TO WATCH
3330-170956-0022 OR THEY WILL CREEP INTO THE CITY UNOBSERVED WHAT EVILS WEALTH I SAID AND POVERTY THE ONE IS THE PARENT OF LUXURY AND INDOLENCE AND THE OTHER OF MEANNESS AND VICIOUSNESS
3330-170956-0023 AND BOTH OF DISCONTENT THAT IS VERY TRUE HE REPLIED BUT STILL I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW SOCRATES HOW OUR CITY WILL BE ABLE TO GO TO WAR ESPECIALLY AGAINST AN ENEMY WHO IS RICH AND POWERFUL IF DEPRIVED OF THE SINEWS OF WAR
3330-170956-0024 THERE WOULD CERTAINLY BE A DIFFICULTY I REPLIED IN GOING TO WAR WITH ONE SUCH ENEMY BUT THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE ARE TWO OF THEM HOW SO HE ASKED IN THE FIRST PLACE I SAID
3330-170956-0025 IF WE HAVE TO FIGHT OUR SIDE WILL BE TRAINED WARRIORS FIGHTING AGAINST AN ARMY OF RICH MEN THAT IS TRUE HE SAID AND DO YOU NOT SUPPOSE ADEIMANTUS THAT A SINGLE BOXER
3330-170956-0026 WHO WAS PERFECT IN HIS ART WOULD EASILY BE A MATCH FOR TWO STOUT AND WELL TO DO GENTLEMEN WHO WERE NOT BOXERS HARDLY IF THEY CAME UPON HIM AT ONCE WHAT NOW I SAID IF HE WERE ABLE TO RUN AWAY
3330-170956-0027 AND THEN TURN AND STRIKE AT THE ONE WHO FIRST CAME UP AND SUPPOSING HE WERE TO DO THIS SEVERAL TIMES UNDER THE HEAT OF A SCORCHING SUN MIGHT HE NOT BEING AN EXPERT OVERTURN MORE THAN ONE STOUT PERSONAGE
3330-170956-0028 CERTAINLY HE SAID THERE WOULD BE NOTHING WONDERFUL IN THAT AND YET RICH MEN PROBABLY HAVE A GREATER SUPERIORITY IN THE SCIENCE AND PRACTISE OF BOXING THAN THEY HAVE IN MILITARY QUALITIES
3330-170956-0029 LIKELY ENOUGH THEN WE MAY ASSUME THAT OUR ATHLETES WILL BE ABLE TO FIGHT WITH TWO OR THREE TIMES THEIR OWN NUMBER I AGREE WITH YOU FOR I THINK YOU RIGHT
3330-170956-0030 WHAT IS THE TRUTH SILVER AND GOLD WE NEITHER HAVE NOR ARE PERMITTED TO HAVE BUT YOU MAY DO YOU THEREFORE COME AND HELP US IN WAR AND TAKE THE SPOILS OF THE OTHER CITY
3330-170956-0031 WHO ON HEARING THESE WORDS WOULD CHOOSE TO FIGHT AGAINST LEAN WIRY DOGS RATHER THAN WITH THE DOGS ON THEIR SIDE AGAINST FAT AND TENDER SHEEP THAT IS NOT LIKELY
3330-170956-0032 AND YET THERE MIGHT BE A DANGER TO THE POOR STATE IF THE WEALTH OF MANY STATES WERE TO BE GATHERED INTO ONE BUT HOW SIMPLE OF YOU TO USE THE TERM STATE AT ALL OF ANY BUT OUR OWN WHY SO
3330-170956-0033 YOU OUGHT TO SPEAK OF OTHER STATES IN THE PLURAL NUMBER NOT ONE OF THEM IS A CITY BUT MANY CITIES AS THEY SAY IN THE GAME FOR INDEED ANY CITY HOWEVER SMALL IS IN FACT DIVIDED INTO TWO
3330-170956-0034 ONE THE CITY OF THE POOR THE OTHER OF THE RICH THESE ARE AT WAR WITH ONE ANOTHER AND IN EITHER THERE ARE MANY SMALLER DIVISIONS AND YOU WOULD BE ALTOGETHER BESIDE THE MARK IF YOU TREATED THEM ALL AS A SINGLE STATE
3330-170956-0035 BUT IF YOU DEAL WITH THEM AS MANY AND GIVE THE WEALTH OR POWER OR PERSONS OF THE ONE TO THE OTHERS YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE A GREAT MANY FRIENDS AND NOT MANY ENEMIES AND YOUR STATE
3330-170956-0036 WHILE THE WISE ORDER WHICH HAS NOW BEEN PRESCRIBED CONTINUES TO PREVAIL IN HER WILL BE THE GREATEST OF STATES I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY IN REPUTATION OR APPEARANCE BUT IN DEED AND TRUTH
3330-170956-0037 THOUGH SHE NUMBER NOT MORE THAN A THOUSAND DEFENDERS A SINGLE STATE WHICH IS HER EQUAL YOU WILL HARDLY FIND EITHER AMONG HELLENES OR BARBARIANS THOUGH MANY THAT APPEAR TO BE AS GREAT AND MANY TIMES GREATER
3330-170956-0038 THAT IS MOST TRUE HE SAID AND WHAT I SAID WILL BE THE BEST LIMIT FOR OUR RULERS TO FIX WHEN THEY ARE CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE STATE AND THE AMOUNT OF TERRITORY WHICH THEY ARE TO INCLUDE AND BEYOND WHICH THEY WILL NOT GO
3330-170956-0039 WHAT LIMIT WOULD YOU PROPOSE I WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO INCREASE SO FAR AS IS CONSISTENT WITH UNITY THAT I THINK IS THE PROPER LIMIT VERY GOOD HE SAID
3330-170956-0040 HERE THEN I SAID IS ANOTHER ORDER WHICH WILL HAVE TO BE CONVEYED TO OUR GUARDIANS LET OUR CITY BE ACCOUNTED NEITHER LARGE NOR SMALL BUT ONE AND SELF SUFFICING
3330-170956-0041 THE OFFSPRING OF THE LOWER CLASSES WHEN NATURALLY SUPERIOR THE INTENTION WAS THAT IN THE CASE OF THE CITIZENS GENERALLY EACH INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE PUT TO THE USE FOR WHICH NATURE INTENDED HIM ONE TO ONE WORK
3330-170956-0042 AND THEN EVERY MAN WOULD DO HIS OWN BUSINESS AND BE ONE AND NOT MANY AND SO THE WHOLE CITY WOULD BE ONE AND NOT MANY YES HE SAID THAT IS NOT SO DIFFICULT
3330-170956-0043 THE REGULATIONS WHICH WE ARE PRESCRIBING MY GOOD ADEIMANTUS ARE NOT AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED A NUMBER OF GREAT PRINCIPLES BUT TRIFLES ALL IF CARE BE TAKEN AS THE SAYING IS OF THE ONE GREAT THING
3330-170956-0044 A THING HOWEVER WHICH I WOULD RATHER CALL NOT GREAT BUT SUFFICIENT FOR OUR PURPOSE WHAT MAY THAT BE HE ASKED EDUCATION I SAID AND NURTURE
3330-170956-0045 IF OUR CITIZENS ARE WELL EDUCATED AND GROW INTO SENSIBLE MEN THEY WILL EASILY SEE THEIR WAY THROUGH ALL THESE AS WELL AS OTHER MATTERS WHICH I OMIT SUCH FOR EXAMPLE AS MARRIAGE THE POSSESSION OF WOMEN AND THE PROCREATION OF CHILDREN
3330-170956-0046 THAT WILL BE THE BEST WAY OF SETTLING THEM ALSO I SAID THE STATE IF ONCE STARTED WELL MOVES WITH ACCUMULATING FORCE LIKE A WHEEL
3330-170956-0047 FOR GOOD NURTURE AND EDUCATION IMPLANT GOOD CONSTITUTIONS AND THESE GOOD CONSTITUTIONS TAKING ROOT IN A GOOD EDUCATION IMPROVE MORE AND MORE AND THIS IMPROVEMENT AFFECTS THE BREED IN MAN AS IN OTHER ANIMALS
3330-170956-0048 VERY POSSIBLY HE SAID THEN TO SUM UP THIS IS THE POINT TO WHICH ABOVE ALL THE ATTENTION OF OUR RULERS SHOULD BE DIRECTED THAT MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC BE PRESERVED IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORM AND NO INNOVATION MADE
3330-170956-0049 THEY MUST DO THEIR UTMOST TO MAINTAIN THEM INTACT AND WHEN ANY ONE SAYS THAT MANKIND MOST REGARD THE NEWEST SONG WHICH THE SINGERS HAVE THEY WILL BE AFRAID THAT HE MAY BE PRAISING NOT NEW SONGS BUT A NEW KIND OF SONG
3330-170956-0050 HE SAYS THAT WHEN MODES OF MUSIC CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE STATE ALWAYS CHANGE WITH THEM YES SAID ADEIMANTUS AND YOU MAY ADD MY SUFFRAGE TO DAMON'S AND YOUR OWN THEN I SAID
3330-170956-0051 OUR GUARDIANS MUST LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF THEIR FORTRESS IN MUSIC YES HE SAID THE LAWLESSNESS OF WHICH YOU SPEAK TOO EASILY STEALS IN YES I REPLIED
3330-170956-0052 IN THE FORM OF AMUSEMENT AND AT FIRST SIGHT IT APPEARS HARMLESS WHY YES HE SAID AND THERE IS NO HARM WERE IT NOT THAT LITTLE BY LITTLE THIS SPIRIT OF LICENCE FINDING A HOME IMPERCEPTIBLY PENETRATES INTO MANNERS AND CUSTOMS
3330-170956-0053 WHENCE ISSUING WITH GREATER FORCE IT INVADES CONTRACTS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN AND FROM CONTRACTS GOES ON TO LAWS AND CONSTITUTIONS
3330-170956-0054 IN UTTER RECKLESSNESS ENDING AT LAST SOCRATES BY AN OVERTHROW OF ALL RIGHTS PRIVATE AS WELL AS PUBLIC IS THAT TRUE I SAID THAT IS MY BELIEF HE REPLIED THEN AS I WAS SAYING
3330-170956-0055 OUR YOUTH SHOULD BE TRAINED FROM THE FIRST IN A STRICTER SYSTEM FOR IF AMUSEMENTS BECOME LAWLESS AND THE YOUTHS THEMSELVES BECOME LAWLESS THEY CAN NEVER GROW UP INTO WELL CONDUCTED AND VIRTUOUS CITIZENS VERY TRUE HE SAID
3330-170956-0056 AND WHEN THEY HAVE MADE A GOOD BEGINNING IN PLAY AND BY THE HELP OF MUSIC HAVE GAINED THE HABIT OF GOOD ORDER THEN THIS HABIT OF ORDER IN A MANNER
3330-170956-0057 HOW UNLIKE THE LAWLESS PLAY OF THE OTHERS WILL ACCOMPANY THEM IN ALL THEIR ACTIONS AND BE A PRINCIPLE OF GROWTH TO THEM AND IF THERE BE ANY FALLEN PLACES IN THE STATE WILL RAISE THEM UP AGAIN VERY TRUE HE SAID
3330-170956-0058 THUS EDUCATED THEY WILL INVENT FOR THEMSELVES ANY LESSER RULES WHICH THEIR PREDECESSORS HAVE ALTOGETHER NEGLECTED WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN SUCH THINGS AS THESE WHEN THE YOUNG ARE TO BE SILENT BEFORE THEIR ELDERS
3330-170956-0059 HOW THEY ARE TO SHOW RESPECT TO THEM BY STANDING AND MAKING THEM SIT WHAT HONOUR IS DUE TO PARENTS WHAT GARMENTS OR SHOES ARE TO BE WORN THE MODE OF DRESSING THE HAIR DEPORTMENT AND MANNERS IN GENERAL YOU WOULD AGREE WITH ME YES
3330-170956-0060 BUT THERE IS I THINK SMALL WISDOM IN LEGISLATING ABOUT SUCH MATTERS I DOUBT IF IT IS EVER DONE NOR ARE ANY PRECISE WRITTEN ENACTMENTS ABOUT THEM LIKELY TO BE LASTING IMPOSSIBLE IT WOULD SEEM ADEIMANTUS
3330-170956-0061 WILL DETERMINE HIS FUTURE LIFE DOES NOT LIKE ALWAYS ATTRACT LIKE TO BE SURE UNTIL SOME ONE RARE AND GRAND RESULT IS REACHED WHICH MAY BE GOOD AND MAY BE THE REVERSE OF GOOD THAT IS NOT TO BE DENIED
3330-170956-0062 AND FOR THIS REASON I SAID I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO LEGISLATE FURTHER ABOUT THEM
