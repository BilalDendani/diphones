8337-280361-0000 AND HE HAD VERY MANY CHILDREN HE WANDERED ABOUT BEGGING WITH HIS FAMILY AND AT LAST HE REACHED A CERTAIN CITY AND ENTERED THE SERVICE OF A RICH HOUSEHOLDER CALLED STHULADATTA
8337-280361-0001 HIS SONS BECAME KEEPERS OF STHULADATTA'S COWS AND OTHER PROPERTY AND HIS WIFE A SERVANT TO HIM AND HE HIMSELF LIVED NEAR HIS HOUSE PERFORMING THE DUTY OF AN ATTENDANT
8337-280361-0002 ONE DAY THERE WAS A FEAST ON ACCOUNT OF THE MARRIAGE OF THE DAUGHTER OF STHULADATTA LARGELY ATTENDED BY MANY FRIENDS OF THE BRIDEGROOM AND MERRY MAKERS
8337-280361-0003 HARISARMAN HOPED THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO FILL HIMSELF UP TO THE THROAT WITH OIL AND FLESH AND OTHER DAINTIES AND GET THE SAME FOR HIS FAMILY IN THE HOUSE OF HIS PATRON
8337-280361-0004 WHILE HE WAS ANXIOUSLY EXPECTING TO BE FED NO ONE THOUGHT OF HIM THEN HE WAS DISTRESSED AT GETTING NOTHING TO EAT AND HE SAID TO HIS WIFE AT NIGHT
8337-280361-0005 AND AFTER TURNING THE MATTER OVER IN HIS MIND WHILE PEOPLE WERE ASLEEP HE TOOK AWAY FROM THE HOUSE OF STHULADATTA A HORSE ON WHICH HIS MASTER'S SON IN LAW RODE
8337-280361-0006 HE PLACED IT IN CONCEALMENT AT SOME DISTANCE AND IN THE MORNING THE FRIENDS OF THE BRIDEGROOM COULD NOT FIND THE HORSE THOUGH THEY SEARCHED IN EVERY DIRECTION
8337-280361-0007 WHILE STHULADATTA WAS DISTRESSED AT THE EVIL OMEN AND SEARCHING FOR THE THIEVES WHO HAD CARRIED OFF THE HORSE THE WIFE OF HARISARMAN CAME AND SAID TO HIM
8337-280361-0008 MY HUSBAND IS A WISE MAN SKILLED IN ASTROLOGY AND MAGICAL SCIENCES HE CAN GET THE HORSE BACK FOR YOU WHY DO YOU NOT ASK HIM WHEN STHULADATTA HEARD THAT
8337-280361-0009 HE CALLED HARISARMAN WHO SAID YESTERDAY I WAS FORGOTTEN BUT TO DAY NOW THE HORSE IS STOLEN I AM CALLED TO MIND
8337-280361-0010 AND STHULADATTA THEN PROPITIATED THE BRAHMAN WITH THESE WORDS
8337-280361-0011 THEN HARISARMAN DREW ALL KINDS OF PRETENDED DIAGRAMS AND SAID THE HORSE HAS BEEN PLACED BY THIEVES ON THE BOUNDARY LINE SOUTH FROM THIS PLACE IT IS CONCEALED THERE
8337-280361-0012 AND BEFORE IT IS CARRIED OFF TO A DISTANCE AS IT WILL BE AT CLOSE OF DAY GO QUICKLY AND BRING IT WHEN THEY HEARD THAT MANY MEN RAN AND BROUGHT THE HORSE QUICKLY
8337-280361-0013 PRAISING THE DISCERNMENT OF HARISARMAN THEN HARISARMAN WAS HONORED BY ALL MEN AS A SAGE AND DWELT THERE IN HAPPINESS HONORED BY STHULADATTA NOW
8337-280361-0014 AS DAYS WENT ON MUCH TREASURE BOTH OF GOLD AND JEWELS HAD BEEN STOLEN BY A THIEF FROM THE PALACE OF THE KING AS THE THIEF WAS NOT KNOWN
8337-280361-0015 THE KING QUICKLY SUMMONED HARISARMAN ON ACCOUNT OF HIS REPUTATION FOR KNOWLEDGE OF MAGIC AND HE WHEN SUMMONED TRIED TO GAIN TIME AND SAID I WILL TELL YOU TO MORROW
8337-280361-0016 AND THEN HE WAS PLACED IN A CHAMBER BY THE KING AND CAREFULLY GUARDED AND HE WAS SAD BECAUSE HE HAD PRETENDED TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE NOW IN THAT PALACE THERE WAS A MAID NAMED JIHVA
8337-280361-0017 WHICH MEANS TONGUE WHO WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HER BROTHER HAD STOLEN THAT TREASURE FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE PALACE SHE BEING ALARMED AT HARISARMAN'S KNOWLEDGE
8337-280361-0018 WHEN JIHVA HEARD THIS SHE THOUGHT IN HER TERROR THAT SHE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED BY THIS WISE MAN AND SHE MANAGED TO GET IN WHERE HE WAS AND FALLING AT HIS FEET
8337-280361-0019 SHE SAID TO THE SUPPOSED WIZARD
8337-280361-0020 THAT JIHVA WHOM YOU HAVE DISCOVERED TO BE THE THIEF OF THE TREASURE AND AFTER I TOOK IT I BURIED IT IN THE EARTH IN A GARDEN BEHIND THE PALACE UNDER A POMEGRANATE TREE SO SPARE ME
8337-280361-0021 WHICH IS IN MY POSSESSION WHEN HARISARMAN HEARD THAT HE SAID TO HER PROUDLY
8337-280361-0022 YOU MUST GIVE BACK TO ME WHEN HE SAID THIS TO THE MAID SHE CONSENTED AND DEPARTED QUICKLY BUT HARISARMAN REFLECTED IN HIS ASTONISHMENT
8337-280361-0023 FATE BRINGS ABOUT AS IF IN SPORT THINGS IMPOSSIBLE FOR WHEN CALAMITY WAS SO NEAR WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT CHANCE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT US SUCCESS
8337-280361-0024 SECRET CRIMES MANIFEST THEMSELVES BY MEANS OF FEAR THUS THINKING HE PASSED THE NIGHT HAPPILY IN THE CHAMBER AND IN THE MORNING
8337-280361-0025 INTO THE GARDEN AND LED HIM UP TO THE TREASURE WHICH WAS BURIED UNDER THE POMEGRANATE TREE AND SAID THE THIEF HAD ESCAPED WITH A PART OF IT THEN THE KING WAS PLEASED
8337-280361-0026 AND GAVE HIM THE REVENUE OF MANY VILLAGES BUT THE MINISTER NAMED DEVAJNANIN WHISPERED IN THE KING'S EAR HOW CAN A MAN POSSESS SUCH KNOWLEDGE
8337-280361-0027 UNATTAINABLE BY MEN WITHOUT HAVING STUDIED THE BOOKS OF MAGIC
8337-280361-0028 BY HAVING A SECRET INTELLIGENCE WITH THIEVES IT WILL BE MUCH BETTER TO TEST HIM BY SOME NEW ARTIFICE THEN THE KING OF HIS OWN ACCORD
8337-280361-0029 BROUGHT A COVERED PITCHER INTO WHICH HE HAD THROWN A FROG AND SAID TO HARISARMAN BRAHMAN IF YOU CAN GUESS WHAT THERE IS IN THIS PITCHER I WILL DO YOU GREAT HONOR TO DAY
8337-280361-0030 AND IMPELLED BY LUCK HE CALLED TO HIMSELF BY HIS PET NAME LAMENTING HIS HARD FATE AND SUDDENLY CALLED OUT THIS IS A FINE PITCHER FOR YOU FROGGIE
8337-280361-0031 RAISED A SHOUT OF APPLAUSE BECAUSE HIS SPEECH CHIMED IN SO WELL WITH THE OBJECT PRESENTED TO HIM AND MURMURED AH A GREAT SAGE
8337-280361-0032 HE KNOWS EVEN ABOUT THE FROG THEN THE KING
