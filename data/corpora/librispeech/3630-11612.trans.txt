3630-11612-0000 APPENDIX C ACOUSTICS
3630-11612-0001 AND WITH PRINCIPLES SUCH AS THAT RELATING TO THE RELATION BETWEEN VIBRATION RATES AND PITCHES
3630-11612-0002 AND THIS APPENDIX IS THEREFORE ADDED IN THE HOPE THAT A FEW FACTS AT LEAST REGARDING THE LAWS OF SOUND MAY BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF SOME WHO WOULD OTHERWISE REMAIN IN ENTIRE IGNORANCE OF THE SUBJECT ONE ACOUSTICS IS THE SCIENCE WHICH DEALS WITH SOUND AND THE LAWS OF ITS PRODUCTION AND TRANSMISSION
3630-11612-0003 SINCE ALL SOUND IS CAUSED BY VIBRATION ACOUSTICS MAY BE DEFINED AS THE SCIENCE WHICH TREATS OF THE PHENOMENA OF SOUND PRODUCING VIBRATION TWO ALL SOUND AS STATED ABOVE IS PRODUCED BY VIBRATION OF SOME SORT
3630-11612-0004 STRIKE A TUNING FORK AGAINST THE TOP OF A TABLE AND SEE THE VIBRATIONS WHICH CAUSE THE TONE OR IF THE FORK IS A SMALL ONE AND THE VIBRATIONS CANNOT BE SEEN HOLD IT AGAINST THE EDGE OF A SHEET OF PAPER AND HEAR THE BLOWS IT STRIKES
3630-11612-0005 OR LOOK CLOSELY AT THE HEAVIER STRINGS OF THE VIOLIN OR BETTER STILL THE CELLO AND WATCH THEM OSCILLATE RAPIDLY TO AND FRO AS THE BOW MOVES ACROSS THEM
3630-11612-0006 THE VOCAL CORDS ET CETERA OFTEN IT IS A COLUMN OF AIR WHOSE VIBRATIONS GIVE RISE TO THE TONE THE REED OR OTHER MEDIUM MERELY SERVING TO SET THE AIR IN VIBRATION THREE SOUND IS TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE AIR IN SOMEWHAT THIS FASHION
3630-11612-0007 THE VIBRATING BODY A STRING FOR EXAMPLE STRIKES THE AIR PARTICLES IN ITS IMMEDIATE VICINITY AND THEY BEING IN CONTACT WITH OTHER SUCH AIR PARTICLES STRIKE THESE OTHERS THE LATTER IN TURN STRIKING YET OTHERS AND SO ON BOTH A FORWARD AND BACKWARD MOVEMENT BEING SET UP OSCILLATION
3630-11612-0008 THESE PARTICLES LIE SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT NO MOVEMENT AT ALL CAN BE DETECTED AND IT IS ONLY WHEN THE DISTURBANCE FINALLY REACHES THE AIR PARTICLES THAT ARE IN CONTACT WITH THE EAR DRUM THAT ANY EFFECT IS EVIDENT
3630-11612-0009 THIS PHENOMENON OF SOUND TRANSMISSION MAY PERHAPS BE MADE MORE CLEAR BY THE OLD ILLUSTRATION OF A SERIES OF EIGHT BILLIARD BALLS IN A ROW ON A TABLE IF THE FIRST BALL IS TAPPED LIGHTLY STRIKING GENTLY AGAINST BALL NUMBER TWO
3630-11612-0010 THE LATTER AS WELL AS NUMBERS THREE FOUR FIVE SIX AND SEVEN WILL NOT APPARENTLY MOVE AT ALL BUT BALL NUMBER EIGHT AT THE OTHER END WILL ROLL AWAY THE AIR PARTICLES ACT UPON EACH OTHER IN MUCH THIS SAME FASHION THE DIFFERENCE BEING THAT WHEN THEY ARE SET IN MOTION BY A VIBRATING BODY
3630-11612-0011 A COMPLETE VIBRATION BACKWARD AND FORWARD CAUSES A SIMILAR BACKWARD AND FORWARD MOVEMENT OF THE PARTICLES OSCILLATION INSTEAD OF SIMPLY A FORWARD JERK AS IN THE CASE OF THE BILLIARD BALLS
3630-11612-0012 WHERE THEY SET THE EAR DRUM IN VIBRATION THUS SENDING CERTAIN SOUND STIMULI TO THE NERVES OF HEARING IN THE INNER EAR AND THUS TO THE BRAIN AN IMPORTANT THING TO BE NOTED IN CONNECTION WITH SOUND TRANSMISSION IS THAT SOUND WILL NOT TRAVEL IN A VACUUM
3630-11612-0013 THIS MEDIUM MAY BE AIR WATER A BAR OF IRON OR STEEL THE EARTH ET CETERA FOUR THE RATE AT WHICH SOUND TRAVELS THROUGH THE AIR IS ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED FEET PER SECOND THE RAPIDITY VARYING SOMEWHAT WITH FLUCTUATIONS IN TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY
3630-11612-0014 IN WATER THE RATE IS MUCH HIGHER THAN IN AIR ABOUT FOUR TIMES AS GREAT WHILE THE VELOCITY OF SOUND THROUGH OTHER MEDIUMS AS E G STEEL IS SOMETIMES AS MUCH AS SIXTEEN TIMES AS GREAT AS THROUGH AIR FIVE
3630-11612-0015 SOUND LIKE LIGHT MAY BE INTENSIFIED BY A SUITABLE REFLECTING SURFACE DIRECTLY BACK OF THE VIBRATING BODY
3630-11612-0016 IT MAY ALSO BE REFLECTED BY SOME SURFACE AT A DISTANCE FROM ITS SOURCE IN SUCH A WAY THAT AT A CERTAIN POINT THE FOCUS THE SOUND MAY BE VERY CLEARLY HEARD BUT AT OTHER PLACES EVEN THOSE NEARER THE SOURCE OF SOUND IT CAN SCARCELY BE HEARD AT ALL
3630-11612-0017 IF THERE IS SUCH A SURFACE IN AN AUDITORIUM AS OFTEN OCCURS THERE WILL BE A CERTAIN POINT WHERE EVERYTHING CAN BE HEARD VERY EASILY
3630-11612-0018 ECHOES ARE CAUSED BY SOUND REFLECTION THE DISTANCE OF THE REFLECTING SURFACE FROM THE VIBRATING BODY DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF SYLLABLES THAT WILL BE ECHOED THE ACOUSTICS OF AN AUDITORIUM
3630-11612-0019 DEPEND UPON THE POSITION AND NATURE OF THE REFLECTING SURFACES AND ALSO UPON THE LENGTH OF TIME A SOUND PERSISTS AFTER THE VIBRATING BODY HAS STOPPED
3630-11612-0020 THE ROOM WILL NOT BE SUITABLE FOR MUSICAL PERFORMANCES BECAUSE OF THE MIXTURE OF PERSISTING TONES WITH FOLLOWING ONES THIS CAUSING A BLURRED EFFECT SOMEWHAT LIKE THAT OBTAINED BY PLAYING A SERIES OF UNRELATED CHORDS ON THE PIANO WHILE THE DAMPER PEDAL IS HELD DOWN
3630-11612-0021 THE DURATION OF THE REVERBERATION DEPENDS UPON THE SIZE AND HEIGHT OF THE ROOM MATERIAL OF FLOOR AND WALLS FURNITURE SIZE OF AUDIENCE ET CETERA SIX
3630-11612-0022 SOUND MAY BE CLASSIFIED ROUGHLY INTO TONES AND NOISES ALTHOUGH THE LINE OF CLEAVAGE IS NOT ALWAYS SHARPLY DRAWN IF I THROW STONES AT THE SIDE OF A BARN SOUNDS ARE PRODUCED BUT THEY ARE CAUSED BY IRREGULAR VIBRATIONS OF AN IRREGULARLY CONSTRUCTED SURFACE AND ARE REFERRED TO AS NOISE
3630-11612-0023 BUT IF I TAP THE HEAD OF A KETTLE DRUM A REGULAR SERIES OF VIBRATIONS IS SET UP AND THE RESULTING SOUND IS REFERRED TO AS TONE IN GENERAL THE MATERIAL OF MUSIC CONSISTS OF TONES
3630-11612-0024 SEVEN
3630-11612-0025 ONE PITCH TWO INTENSITY THREE QUALITY TIMBRE BY PITCH IS MEANT THE HIGHNESS OR LOWNESS OF TONE IT DEPENDS UPON RATE OF VIBRATION IF A BODY VIBRATES ONLY EIGHT OR TEN TIMES PER SECOND NO TONE IS HEARD AT ALL
3630-11612-0026 BUT IF IT VIBRATES REGULARLY AT THE RATE OF SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN PER SECOND A TONE OF VERY LOW PITCH IS HEARD IF IT VIBRATES AT THE RATE OF TWENTY FOUR THE PITCH IS HIGHER
3630-11612-0027 AT THIRTY HIGHER STILL AT TWO HUNDRED YET HIGHER AND WHEN A RATE OF ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND PER SECOND HAS BEEN REACHED THE PITCH IS SO HIGH THAT MOST EARS CANNOT PERCEIVE IT AT ALL
3630-11612-0028 THE HIGHEST TONE THAT CAN ORDINARILY BE HEARD IS THE E FLAT FOUR OCTAVES HIGHER THAN THE HIGHEST E FLAT OF THE PIANO THE ENTIRE RANGE OF SOUND HUMANLY AUDIBLE IS THEREFORE ABOUT ELEVEN OCTAVES
3630-11612-0029 BUT ONLY ABOUT EIGHT OF THESE OCTAVES ARE UTILIZED FOR MUSICAL PURPOSES
3630-11612-0030 ARE PRODUCED BY VIBRATION RATES APPROXIMATELY BETWEEN TWENTY SEVEN AND FORTY TWO TWENTY FOUR IN THE ORCHESTRA THE RANGE IS SLIGHTLY MORE EXTENDED THE RATES BEING FROM THIRTY THREE TO FORTY SEVEN FIFTY TWO
3630-11612-0031 CERTAIN INTERESTING FACTS REGARDING THE RELATION BETWEEN VIBRATION RATES AND PITCHES HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT IT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED FOR INSTANCE THAT IF THE NUMBER OF VIBRATIONS IS DOUBLED THE PITCH OF THE RESULTING TONE IS AN OCTAVE HIGHER
3630-11612-0032 IN THE SAME WAY IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT IF THE RATE IS MULTIPLIED BY FIVE QUARTERS THE PITCH OF THE TONE WILL BE A MAJOR THIRD HIGHER
3630-11612-0033 THESE LAWS ARE OFTEN STATED THUS THE RATIO OF THE OCTAVE TO THE FUNDAMENTAL IS AS TWO IS TO ONE THAT OF THE MAJOR THIRD AS FIVE IS TO FOUR THAT OF THE PERFECT FIFTH AS THREE IS TO TWO AND SO ON THROUGH THE ENTIRE SERIES OF PITCHES EMBRACED WITHIN THE OCTAVE
3630-11612-0034 THE RATIO BEING OF COURSE THE SAME FOR ALL OCTAVES NINE THE INTENSITY LOUDNESS OR SOFTNESS OF TONES DEPENDS UPON THE AMPLITUDE WIDTH OF THE VIBRATIONS
3630-11612-0035 A LOUDER TONE BEING THE RESULT OF VIBRATIONS OF GREATER AMPLITUDE AND VICE VERSA THIS MAY BE VERIFIED BY PLUCKING A LONG STRING ON CELLO OR DOUBLE BASS AND NOTING THAT WHEN PLUCKED GENTLY VIBRATIONS OF SMALL AMPLITUDE ARE SET UP
3630-11612-0036 IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE PITCH OF THE TONE IS NOT AFFECTED BY THE CHANGE IN AMPLITUDE OF VIBRATION THE INTENSITY OF TONES VARIES WITH THE MEDIUM CONVEYING THEM BEING USUALLY LOUDER AT NIGHT BECAUSE THE AIR IS THEN MORE ELASTIC
3630-11612-0037 TONE INTENSITY IS ALSO AFFECTED BY SYMPATHETIC VIBRATIONS SET UP IN OTHER BODIES IF TWO STRINGS OF THE SAME LENGTH ARE STRETCHED SIDE BY SIDE AND ONE SET IN VIBRATION SO AS TO PRODUCE TONE
3630-11612-0038 THE OTHER WILL SOON BEGIN TO VIBRATE ALSO AND THE COMBINED TONE WILL BE LOUDER THAN IF ONLY ONE STRING PRODUCED IT
3630-11612-0039 TEN QUALITY DEPENDS UPON THE SHAPE OR FORM OF THE VIBRATIONS WHICH GIVE RISE TO THE TONE A SERIES OF SIMPLE VIBRATIONS WILL CAUSE A SIMPLE OR COLORLESS TONE
3630-11612-0040 CAUSE MORE INDIVIDUALISTIC PECULIARITIES OF QUALITY QUALITY IS AFFECTED ALSO BY THE SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE RESONANCE BODY
3630-11612-0041 ELEVEN PRACTICALLY EVERY MUSICAL TONE REALLY CONSISTS OF A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL TONES SOUNDING SIMULTANEOUSLY
3630-11612-0042 THE MOST IMPORTANT TONE OF THE SERIES IS THE FUNDAMENTAL WHICH DOMINATES THE COMBINATION AND GIVES THE PITCH BUT THIS FUNDAMENTAL IS PRACTICALLY ALWAYS COMBINED WITH A GREATER OR LESS NUMBER OF FAINT AND ELUSIVE ATTENDING TONES CALLED OVERTONES OR HARMONICS
3630-11612-0043 THE FIRST OF THESE OVERTONES IS THE OCTAVE ABOVE THE FUNDAMENTAL THE SECOND IS THE FIFTH ABOVE THIS OCTAVE THE THIRD TWO OCTAVES ABOVE THE FUNDAMENTAL AND SO ON THROUGH THE SERIES AS SHOWN IN THE FIGURE BELOW
3630-11612-0044 DOES NOT MERELY VIBRATE IN ITS ENTIRETY BUT HAS IN ADDITION TO THE PRINCIPAL OSCILLATION A NUMBER OF SECTIONAL MOVEMENTS ALSO
3630-11612-0045 THUS IT IS EASILY PROVED THAT A STRING VIBRATES IN HALVES THIRDS ET CETERA IN ADDITION TO THE PRINCIPAL VIBRATION OF THE ENTIRE STRING AND IT IS THE VIBRATION OF THESE HALVES THIRDS ET CETERA WHICH GIVES RISE TO THE HARMONICS OR UPPER PARTIALS AS THEY ARE OFTEN CALLED
3630-11612-0046 THUS E G A TONE THAT HAS TOO LARGE A PROPORTION OF THE FOURTH UPPER PARTIAL
3630-11612-0047 WILL BE REEDY AND SOMEWHAT UNPLEASANT THIS IS THE CASE WITH MANY VOICES THAT ARE REFERRED TO AS NASAL TOO GREAT A PROPORTION OF OVERTONES IS WHAT CAUSES CERTAIN PIANOS TO SOUND TIN PANNY
3630-11612-0048 IT HAS THEREFORE NO DISTINCTIVE QUALITY AND IS SAID TO BE A SIMPLE TONE THE CHARACTERISTIC TONE OF THE OBOE ON THE OTHER HAND HAS MANY OVERTONES AND IS THEREFORE HIGHLY INDIVIDUALISTIC THIS ENABLES US TO RECOGNIZE THE TONE OF THE INSTRUMENT EVEN THOUGH WE CANNOT SEE THE PLAYER
3630-11612-0049 SUCH A TONE IS SAID TO BE COMPLEX TWELVE
3630-11612-0050 IF STRICTLY CARRIED OUT IN TUNING A KEYBOARD INSTRUMENT WOULD CAUSE THE HALF STEPS TO VARY SLIGHTLY IN SIZE AND PLAYING IN CERTAIN KEYS ESPECIALLY THOSE HAVING A NUMBER OF SHARPS OR FLATS IN THE SIGNATURE WOULD THEREFORE SOUND OUT OF TUNE
3630-11612-0051 THERE WOULD BE MANY OTHER DISADVANTAGES IN SUCH A SYSTEM NOTABLY THE INABILITY TO MODULATE FREELY TO OTHER KEYS
3630-11612-0052 THIS WOULD CONSTITUTE A SERIOUS BARRIER TO ADVANCES IN COMPOSITION TO OBVIATE THESE DISADVANTAGES A SYSTEM OF EQUAL TEMPERAMENT WAS INVENTED AND HAS BEEN IN UNIVERSAL USE SINCE THE TIME OF BACH SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTEEN FIFTY WHO WAS THE FIRST PROMINENT COMPOSER TO USE IT EXTENSIVELY
3630-11612-0053 EQUAL TEMPERAMENT MEANS SIMPLY DIVIDING THE OCTAVE INTO TWELVE EQUAL PARTS THUS CAUSING ALL SCALES AS PLAYED ON KEYBOARD INSTRUMENTS AT LEAST TO SOUND EXACTLY ALIKE
3630-11612-0054 TO SHOW THE PRACTICABILITY OF EQUAL TEMPERAMENT BACH WROTE A SERIES OF FORTY EIGHT PRELUDES AND FUGUES TWO IN EACH MAJOR AND TWO IN EACH MINOR KEY HE CALLED THE COLLECTION THE WELL TEMPERED CLAVICHORD THIRTEEN
3630-11612-0055 VARIOUS STANDARDS OF PITCH HAVE EXISTED AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN THE LAST TWO CENTURIES AND EVEN NOW THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE UNIFORMITY ALTHOUGH CONDITIONS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THEY WERE EVEN TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO SCIENTISTS USE WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE SCIENTIFIC STANDARD SOMETIMES CALLED THE PHILOSOPHIC STANDARD
3630-11612-0056 THIS PITCH IS NOT IN ACTUAL USE FOR MUSICAL PURPOSES BUT IS RETAINED FOR THEORETICAL PURPOSES BECAUSE OF ITS CONVENIENCE OF COMPUTATION BEING A POWER OF TWO
3630-11612-0057 THIS HAVING BEEN ADOPTED BY THE FRENCH AS THEIR OFFICIAL PITCH SOME TWENTY SIX YEARS BEFORE IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE A CONVENTION OF PIANO MANUFACTURERS AT PHILADELPHIA ADOPTED THIS SAME PITCH FOR THE UNITED STATES AND IT HAS BEEN IN PRACTICALLY UNIVERSAL USE EVER SINCE
3630-11612-0058 CONCERT PITCH IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN INTERNATIONAL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO VARYING SOMEWHAT BUT BEING ALMOST ALWAYS LESS THAN ONE HALF STEP
3630-11612-0059 THIS HIGHER PITCH IS STILL OFTEN USED BY BANDS AND SOMETIMES BY ORCHESTRAS TO GIVE GREATER BRILLIANCY TO THE WIND INSTRUMENTS REFERENCES
