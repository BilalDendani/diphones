3992-714-0023 WERE FIXED IN CONFUSION HE THRUST THEM HURRIEDLY INTO HIS POCKET HE FLUSHED AT THAT MOMENT THE INNKEEPER BROUGHT IN AN UNCORKED BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE AND GLASSES ON A TRAY
3992-714-0024 MITYA SNATCHED UP THE BOTTLE BUT HE WAS SO BEWILDERED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT KALGANOV TOOK IT FROM HIM AND POURED OUT THE CHAMPAGNE ANOTHER ANOTHER BOTTLE MITYA CRIED TO THE INNKEEPER
3992-714-0025 HE DRANK OFF HIS GLASS WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY ONE ELSE HIS WHOLE COUNTENANCE SUDDENLY CHANGED THE SOLEMN AND TRAGIC EXPRESSION WITH WHICH HE HAD ENTERED VANISHED COMPLETELY AND A LOOK OF SOMETHING CHILDLIKE CAME INTO HIS FACE
3992-714-0026 HE SEEMED TO HAVE BECOME SUDDENLY GENTLE AND SUBDUED HE LOOKED SHYLY AND HAPPILY AT EVERY ONE WITH A CONTINUAL NERVOUS LITTLE LAUGH AND THE BLISSFUL EXPRESSION OF A DOG WHO HAS DONE WRONG BEEN PUNISHED AND FORGIVEN
3992-714-0027 HE SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING AND WAS LOOKING ROUND AT EVERY ONE WITH A CHILDLIKE SMILE OF DELIGHT HE LOOKED AT GRUSHENKA LAUGHING CONTINUALLY AND BRINGING HIS CHAIR CLOSE UP TO HER
3992-714-0028 THOUGH HE HAD FORMED NO DEFINITE CONCEPTION OF THEM YET THE POLE ON THE SOFA STRUCK HIM BY HIS DIGNIFIED DEMEANOR AND HIS POLISH ACCENT AND ABOVE ALL BY HIS PIPE WELL WHAT OF IT
3992-714-0029 IT'S A GOOD THING HE'S SMOKING A PIPE HE REFLECTED THE POLE'S PUFFY MIDDLE AGED FACE WITH ITS TINY NOSE AND TWO VERY THIN POINTED DYED AND IMPUDENT LOOKING MUSTACHES HAD NOT SO FAR ROUSED THE FAINTEST DOUBTS IN MITYA
3992-714-0030 WITH LOVE LOCKS FOOLISHLY COMBED FORWARD OVER THE TEMPLES I SUPPOSE IT'S ALL RIGHT SINCE HE WEARS A WIG HE WENT ON MUSING BLISSFULLY
3992-714-0031 THE OTHER YOUNGER POLE WHO WAS STARING INSOLENTLY AND DEFIANTLY AT THE COMPANY AND LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION WITH SILENT CONTEMPT STILL ONLY IMPRESSED MITYA BY HIS GREAT HEIGHT WHICH WAS IN STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE POLE ON THE SOFA
3992-714-0032 IN HIS MOOD OF DOGLIKE SUBMISSIVENESS ALL FEELING OF RIVALRY HAD DIED AWAY GRUSHENKA'S MOOD AND THE ENIGMATIC TONE OF SOME OF HER WORDS HE COMPLETELY FAILED TO GRASP
3992-714-0033 ALL HE UNDERSTOOD WITH THRILLING HEART WAS THAT SHE WAS KIND TO HIM THAT SHE HAD FORGIVEN HIM AND MADE HIM SIT BY HER HE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH DELIGHT WATCHING HER SIP HER GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE THE SILENCE OF THE COMPANY SEEMED SOMEHOW TO STRIKE HIM HOWEVER
3992-714-0034 AS THOUGH DIVINING HIS THOUGHT AND POINTING TO MAXIMOV MITYA IMMEDIATELY STARED AT KALGANOV AND THEN AT MAXIMOV HE'S TALKING NONSENSE HE LAUGHED HIS SHORT WOODEN LAUGH SEEMING SUDDENLY DELIGHTED AT SOMETHING HA HA
3992-714-0035 YES WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT HE WILL HAVE IT THAT ALL OUR CAVALRY OFFICERS IN THE TWENTIES MARRIED POLISH WOMEN THAT'S AWFUL ROT ISN'T IT POLISH WOMEN REPEATED MITYA PERFECTLY ECSTATIC
3992-714-0036 KALGANOV WAS WELL AWARE OF MITYA'S ATTITUDE TO GRUSHENKA AND HE GUESSED ABOUT THE POLE TOO BUT THAT DID NOT SO MUCH INTEREST HIM PERHAPS DID NOT INTEREST HIM AT ALL WHAT HE WAS INTERESTED IN WAS MAXIMOV
3992-714-0037 HE HAD COME HERE WITH MAXIMOV BY CHANCE AND HE MET THE POLES HERE AT THE INN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE GRUSHENKA HE KNEW BEFORE AND HAD ONCE BEEN WITH SOME ONE TO SEE HER BUT SHE HAD NOT TAKEN TO HIM
3992-714-0038 BUT HERE SHE LOOKED AT HIM VERY AFFECTIONATELY BEFORE MITYA'S ARRIVAL SHE HAD BEEN MAKING MUCH OF HIM BUT HE SEEMED SOMEHOW TO BE UNMOVED BY IT HE WAS A BOY NOT OVER TWENTY DRESSED LIKE A DANDY
3992-714-0039 WITH A VERY CHARMING FAIR SKINNED FACE AND SPLENDID THICK FAIR HAIR FROM HIS FAIR FACE LOOKED OUT BEAUTIFUL PALE BLUE EYES WITH AN INTELLIGENT AND SOMETIMES EVEN DEEP EXPRESSION BEYOND HIS AGE INDEED
3992-714-0040 ALTHOUGH THE YOUNG MAN SOMETIMES LOOKED AND TALKED QUITE LIKE A CHILD
3992-714-0041 AT OTHER TIMES HE WOULD GROW EXCITED SOMETIMES APPARENTLY OVER THE MOST TRIVIAL MATTERS ONLY IMAGINE I'VE BEEN TAKING HIM ABOUT WITH ME FOR THE LAST FOUR DAYS HE WENT ON INDOLENTLY DRAWLING HIS WORDS QUITE NATURALLY
3992-714-0042 THOUGH WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTATION EVER SINCE YOUR BROTHER DO YOU REMEMBER SHOVED HIM OFF THE CARRIAGE AND SENT HIM FLYING
3992-714-0043 AND I TOOK HIM INTO THE COUNTRY BUT HE KEEPS TALKING SUCH ROT I'M ASHAMED TO BE WITH HIM I'M TAKING HIM BACK THE GENTLEMAN HAS NOT SEEN POLISH LADIES AND SAYS WHAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
3992-714-0044 THE POLE WITH THE PIPE OBSERVED TO MAXIMOV HE SPOKE RUSSIAN FAIRLY WELL MUCH BETTER ANYWAY THAN HE PRETENDED IF HE USED RUSSIAN WORDS HE ALWAYS DISTORTED THEM INTO A POLISH FORM BUT I WAS MARRIED TO A POLISH LADY MYSELF TITTERED MAXIMOV
3992-714-0045 BUT DID YOU SERVE IN THE CAVALRY
3992-714-0046 WERE YOU A CAVALRY OFFICER PUT IN KALGANOV AT ONCE WAS HE A CAVALRY OFFICER INDEED HA HA CRIED MITYA LISTENING EAGERLY AND TURNING HIS INQUIRING EYES TO EACH AS HE SPOKE AS THOUGH THERE WERE NO KNOWING
3992-714-0047 WHAT HE MIGHT HEAR FROM EACH NO YOU SEE MAXIMOV TURNED TO HIM WHAT I MEAN IS THAT THOSE PRETTY POLISH LADIES WHEN THEY DANCED THE MAZURKA WITH OUR UHLANS WHEN ONE OF THEM DANCES A MAZURKA WITH A UHLAN SHE JUMPS ON HIS KNEE LIKE A KITTEN
3992-714-0048 A LITTLE WHITE ONE AND THE PAN FATHER AND PAN MOTHER LOOK ON AND ALLOW IT THEY ALLOW IT AND NEXT DAY THE UHLAN COMES AND OFFERS HER HIS HAND
3992-714-0049 MAXIMOV ENDED TITTERING THE PAN IS A LAJDAK
3992-714-0050 THE TALL POLE ON THE CHAIR GROWLED SUDDENLY AND CROSSED ONE LEG OVER THE OTHER MITYA'S EYE WAS CAUGHT BY HIS HUGE GREASED BOOT WITH ITS THICK DIRTY SOLE THE DRESS OF BOTH THE POLES LOOKED RATHER GREASY
3992-714-0051 WELL NOW IT'S LAJDAK WHAT'S HE SCOLDING ABOUT SAID GRUSHENKA SUDDENLY VEXED PANI AGRIPPINA
3992-714-0052 I'M NOT HINDERING THEM PANI SAID THE POLE IN THE WIG WITH A LONG LOOK AT GRUSHENKA AND RELAPSING INTO DIGNIFIED SILENCE HE SUCKED HIS PIPE AGAIN NO NO THE POLISH GENTLEMAN SPOKE THE TRUTH KALGANOV GOT EXCITED AGAIN
3992-714-0053 HE'S NEVER BEEN IN POLAND SO HOW CAN HE TALK ABOUT IT I SUPPOSE YOU WEREN'T MARRIED IN POLAND WERE YOU NO IN THE PROVINCE OF SMOLENSK ONLY A UHLAN HAD BROUGHT HER TO RUSSIA BEFORE THAT
3992-714-0054 MY FUTURE WIFE WITH HER MAMMA AND HER AUNT AND ANOTHER FEMALE RELATION WITH A GROWN UP SON HE BROUGHT HER STRAIGHT FROM POLAND AND GAVE HER UP TO ME HE WAS A LIEUTENANT IN OUR REGIMENT A VERY NICE YOUNG MAN AT FIRST HE MEANT TO MARRY HER HIMSELF
3992-714-0055 BUT HE DIDN'T MARRY HER BECAUSE SHE TURNED OUT TO BE LAME
3992-714-0056 YES THEY BOTH DECEIVED ME A LITTLE BIT AT THE TIME AND CONCEALED IT I THOUGHT SHE WAS HOPPING SHE KEPT HOPPING I THOUGHT IT WAS FOR FUN
3992-714-0057 YES SO PLEASED BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE QUITE A DIFFERENT CAUSE AFTERWARDS WHEN WE WERE MARRIED AFTER THE WEDDING THAT VERY EVENING SHE CONFESSED AND VERY TOUCHINGLY ASKED FORGIVENESS
3992-714-0058 I ONCE JUMPED OVER A PUDDLE WHEN I WAS A CHILD SHE SAID AND INJURED MY LEG HE HE KALGANOV WENT OFF INTO THE MOST CHILDISH LAUGHTER ALMOST FALLING ON THE SOFA
3992-714-0059 GRUSHENKA TOO LAUGHED MITYA WAS AT THE PINNACLE OF HAPPINESS DO YOU KNOW THAT'S THE TRUTH HE'S NOT LYING NOW EXCLAIMED KALGANOV TURNING TO MITYA
3992-714-0060 AND WHAT WAS WORSE SHE'D HAD ALL MY LITTLE PROPERTY TRANSFERRED TO HER BEFOREHAND YOU'RE AN EDUCATED MAN SHE SAID TO ME YOU CAN ALWAYS GET YOUR LIVING SHE SETTLED MY BUSINESS WITH THAT
3992-714-0061 DON'T YOU THINK SO SOME PEOPLE ARE LOW FROM SELF INTEREST BUT HE'S SIMPLY SO FROM NATURE ONLY FANCY HE CLAIMS HE WAS ARGUING ABOUT IT ALL THE WAY YESTERDAY THAT GOGOL WROTE DEAD SOULS ABOUT HIM DO YOU REMEMBER
3992-714-0062 THERE'S A LANDOWNER CALLED MAXIMOV IN IT WHOM NOZDRYOV THRASHED HE WAS CHARGED DO YOU REMEMBER FOR INFLICTING BODILY INJURY WITH RODS ON THE LANDOWNER MAXIMOV IN A DRUNKEN CONDITION
3992-714-0063 TCHITCHIKOV MADE HIS JOURNEY AT THE VERY LATEST AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIES SO THAT THE DATES DON'T FIT
3992-714-0064 HE COULDN'T COULD HE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE WHAT KALGANOV WAS EXCITED ABOUT BUT HIS EXCITEMENT WAS GENUINE
3992-714-0065 WELL BUT IF THEY DID THRASH HIM HE CRIED LAUGHING IT'S NOT THAT THEY THRASHED ME EXACTLY BUT WHAT I MEAN IS PUT IN MAXIMOV WHAT DO YOU MEAN EITHER THEY THRASHED YOU OR THEY DIDN'T
3992-714-0066 THE OTHER SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN REPLY NEITHER OF THEM HAD A WATCH WHY NOT TALK LET OTHER PEOPLE TALK MUSTN'T OTHER PEOPLE TALK BECAUSE YOU'RE BORED GRUSHENKA FLEW AT HIM WITH EVIDENT INTENTION OF FINDING FAULT
