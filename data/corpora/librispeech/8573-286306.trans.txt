8573-286306-0000 SOME THREW THEMSELVES ON THEIR FACES OTHERS GOT OVER THE PARAPET AND HUNG BY THEIR HANDS UNTIL HE HAD PASSED WHILE SOME SQUEEZED THEMSELVES AGAINST THE WALL BUT THE ELEPHANT PASSED ON WITHOUT DOING HARM TO ANY
8573-286306-0001 AND AVOIDING THE BUSY STREETS OF THE TOWN DIRECTED ITS COURSE TOWARDS THE MORE QUIET ROADS OF THE OPULENT QUARTER OF MEGARA THE CRIES OF THE PEOPLE AT THE APPROACH OF THE ELEPHANT PRECEDED ITS COURSE AND ALL TOOK REFUGE IN GARDENS OR HOUSES
8573-286306-0002 THE LATTER BECAME LESS AND LESS FREQUENT UNTIL AT A DISTANCE OF TWO MILES FROM THE FOOT OF THE CITADEL THE MAHOUT ON LOOKING ROUND PERCEIVED NO ONE IN SIGHT HE BROUGHT THE ELEPHANT SUDDENLY TO A STANDSTILL QUICK MY LORD
8573-286306-0003 HE EXCLAIMED NOW IS THE TIME
8573-286306-0004 CLIMBED OUT OF THE HOWDAH AND SLIPPED DOWN BY THE ELEPHANT'S TAIL THE USUAL PLAN FOR DISMOUNTING WHEN AN ELEPHANT IS ON ITS FEET
8573-286306-0005 LEAPED INTO A GARDEN AND HID HIMSELF AMONG SOME BUSHES THE MAHOUT NOW TURNED THE ELEPHANT AND
8573-286306-0006 SLOWLY RETRACED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE CITADEL A MINUTE OR TWO LATER MALCHUS ISSUED OUT AND QUIETLY FOLLOWED IT HE HAD GONE SOME DISTANCE WHEN HE SAW AN ARAB APPROACHING HIM AND SOON RECOGNIZED NESSUS
8573-286306-0007 THEY TURNED OFF TOGETHER FROM THE MAIN ROAD
8573-286306-0008 AT A SPOT NEAR THE PORT THEY FOUND ONE OF THE ARABS FROM ABOVE AWAITING THEM AND HE AT ONCE LED THE WAY TO THE HOUSE INHABITED BY HIS FAMILY THE SCHEME HAD BEEN ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL
8573-286306-0009 AND IN HIS ARAB GARB HE COULD NOW TRAVERSE THE STREETS UNSUSPECTED NESSUS WAS OVERJOYED AT THE SUCCESS OF THE STRATAGEM AND MALCHUS HIMSELF COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT HE HAD ESCAPED FROM THE TERRIBLE DANGER WHICH THREATENED HIM
8573-286306-0010 NESSUS AND THE ARAB AT ONCE RETURNED TO THE CITADEL IT WAS AGREED THAT THE FORMER HAD BETTER CONTINUE HIS WORK AS USUAL UNTIL THE EVENING
8573-286306-0011 AND THE EVENTS WHICH HAD OCCURRED SINCE HIS LANDING AT CARTHAGE AND ASKING HIM TO RECEIVE HIM PRIVATELY IN TWO HOURS TIME IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT CONSULT HIM AS TO THE BEST PLAN TO BE FOLLOWED NESSUS RETURNED SAYING THAT MANON WAS AT HOME AND WAS AWAITING HIM
8573-286306-0012 AND THE TWO AT ONCE SET OUT FOR HIS HOUSE
8573-286306-0013 RECEIVED HIM MOST WARMLY AND LISTENED IN ASTONISHMENT TO HIS STORY OF WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM MALCHUS THEN EXPLAINED THE MISSION WITH WHICH HANNIBAL HAD CHARGED HIM AND ASKED HIS ADVICE AS TO THE BEST COURSE TO BE ADOPTED MANON WAS SILENT FOR A TIME
8573-286306-0014 HANNO'S FACTION IS ALL POWERFUL AT PRESENT HE SAID AND WERE HANNIBAL HIMSELF HERE I DOUBT WHETHER HIS VOICE COULD STIR THE SENATE INTO TAKING ACTION SUCH AS IS NEEDED THE TIMES HAVE BEEN HARD
8573-286306-0015 AND HANNO AND HIS PARTY HAVE LAVISHED MONEY SO FREELY AMONG THE LOWER CLASSES THAT THERE IS NO HOPE OF STIRRING THE POPULACE UP TO DECLARE AGAINST HIM I THINK IT WOULD BE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE DANGEROUS WERE WE AS YOU PROPOSE
8573-286306-0016 TO INTRODUCE YOU SUDDENLY TO THE SENATE AS HANNIBAL'S AMBASSADOR TO THEM AND LEAVE YOU TO PLEAD HIS CAUSE YOU WOULD OBTAIN NO HEARING HANNO WOULD RISE IN HIS PLACE AND DENOUNCE YOU AS ONE ALREADY CONDEMNED BY THE TRIBUNALS AS AN ENEMY TO THE REPUBLIC
8573-286306-0017 AND WOULD DEMAND YOUR INSTANT EXECUTION AND AS HE HAS A GREAT MAJORITY OF VOTES IN THE SENATE HIS DEMAND WOULD BE COMPLIED WITH YOU WOULD I AM CONVINCED THROW AWAY YOUR LIFE FOR NO GOOD PURPOSE WHILE YOUR PRESENCE AND YOUR MYSTERIOUS ESCAPE FROM PRISON
8573-286306-0018 WOULD BE MADE THE PRETENSE FOR A FRESH SERIES OF PERSECUTIONS OF OUR PARTISANS I UNDERSTAND AS WELL AS YOU DO THE URGENCY FOR REINFORCEMENTS BEING SENT TO ITALY BUT IN ORDER TO DO THIS THE NAVY NOW ROTTING IN OUR HARBOURS MUST BE REPAIRED
8573-286306-0019 THE COMMAND OF THE SEA MUST BE REGAINED AND FRESH LEVIES OF TROOPS MADE TO ASK CARTHAGE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES IN HER PRESENT MOOD IS HOPELESS WE MUST AWAIT AN OPPORTUNITY I AND MY FRIENDS WILL PREPARE THE WAY
8573-286306-0020 WILL SET OUR AGENTS TO WORK AMONG THE PEOPLE AND WHEN THE NEWS OF ANOTHER VICTORY ARRIVES AND THE PEOPLE'S HOPES ARE AROUSED AND EXCITED WE WILL STRIKE WHILE THE IRON IS HOT AND CALL UPON THEM TO MAKE ONE GREAT EFFORT TO BRING THE STRUGGLE TO A CONCLUSION AND TO FINISH WITH ROME FOREVER
8573-286306-0021 SUCH IS IN MY OPINION THE ONLY POSSIBLE MODE OF PROCEEDING TO MOVE NOW WOULD BE TO ENSURE A REJECTION OF OUR DEMANDS TO BRING FRESH PERSECUTIONS UPON US AND SO TO WEAKEN US THAT WE SHOULD BE POWERLESS TO TURN TO GOOD ACCOUNT
8573-286306-0022 THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH THE NEWS OF ANOTHER GREAT VICTORY WOULD AFFORD I WILL WRITE AT ONCE TO HANNIBAL AND EXPLAIN ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE SITUATION AND WILL TELL HIM WHY I HAVE COUNSELLED YOU TO AVOID CARRYING OUT HIS INSTRUCTIONS
8573-286306-0023 IN THE MEANTIME YOU MUST FOR A SHORT TIME REMAIN IN CONCEALMENT WHILE I ARRANGE FOR A SHIP TO CARRY YOU BACK TO ITALY
8573-286306-0024 FOR CARTHAGE WITH ITS HIDEOUS TYRANNY ITS FOUL CORRUPTION ITS FORGETFULNESS OF ITS GLORY ITS HONOUR AND EVEN ITS SAFETY IS UTTERLY HATEFUL TO ME I TRUST THAT NEVER AGAIN SHALL I SET FOOT WITHIN ITS WALLS
8573-286306-0025 MANON SAID FOR THE YOUNG BLOOD RUNS HOTLY IN YOUR VEINS AND YOUR RAGE AT SEEING THE FATE WHICH IS TOO CERTAINLY IMPENDING OVER CARTHAGE AND WHICH YOU ARE POWERLESS TO PREVENT IS IN NO WAY TO BE BLAMED
8573-286306-0026 WE OLD MEN BOW MORE RESIGNEDLY TO THE DECREES OF THE GODS YOU KNOW THE SAYING THOSE WHOM THE GODS WOULD DESTROY THEY FIRST STRIKE WITH MADNESS CARTHAGE IS SUCH
8573-286306-0027 SHE SEES UNMOVED THE HEROIC EFFORTS WHICH HANNIBAL AND HIS ARMY ARE MAKING TO SAVE HER AND SHE WILL NOT STRETCH OUT A HAND TO AID HIM SHE LIVES CONTENTEDLY UNDER THE CONSTANT TYRANNY OF HANNO'S RULE
8573-286306-0028 SATISFIED TO BE WEALTHY LUXURIOUS AND SLOTHFUL TO CARRY ON HER TRADE TO KEEP HER RICHES CARING NOTHING FOR THE MANLY VIRTUES INDIFFERENT TO VALOUR PREPARING HERSELF SLOWLY AND SURELY TO FALL AN EASY PREY TO ROME
8573-286306-0029 THE END PROBABLY WILL NOT COME IN MY TIME IT MAY COME IN YOURS BUT COME IT CERTAINLY AND SURELY WILL A NATION WHICH CAN PLACE A MERE HANDFUL OF ITS OWN CITIZENS IN THE LINE OF BATTLE VOLUNTARILY DOOMS HERSELF TO DESTRUCTION
8573-286306-0030 I WILL BE NO SHARER IN THE FATE OF CARTHAGE I HAVE DONE WITH HER AND IF I DO NOT FALL IN THE BATTLEFIELD I WILL
8573-286306-0031 WHERE IF THE LIFE IS ROUGH IT IS AT LEAST FREE AND INDEPENDENT WHERE COURAGE AND MANLINESS AND HONOUR COUNT FOR MUCH AND WHERE THE ENERVATING INFLUENCE OF WEALTH IS AS YET UNKNOWN SUCH IS MY FIRM RESOLUTION
8573-286306-0032 SUCH ARE THE NATURAL SENTIMENTS OF YOUR AGE AND METHINKS WERE MY OWN TIME TO COME OVER AGAIN I TOO WOULD CHOOSE SUCH A LIFE IN PREFERENCE TO AN EXISTENCE IN THE POLLUTED ATMOSPHERE OF UNGRATEFUL CARTHAGE AND NOW
8573-286306-0033 WILL YOU STOP HERE WITH ME OR WILL YOU RETURN TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE STAYING I NEED NOT SAY HOW GLADLY I WOULD HAVE YOU HERE BUT I CANNOT ANSWER CERTAINLY FOR YOUR SAFETY EVERY MOVEMENT OF THOSE BELONGING TO OUR PARTY IS WATCHED BY HANNO
8573-286306-0034 AND I DOUBT NOT THAT HE HAS HIS SPIES AMONG MY SLAVES AND SERVANTS
8573-286306-0035 LET YOUR FOLLOWER COME NIGHTLY TO ME FOR INSTRUCTIONS
8573-286306-0036 I WILL COME DOWN AND SEE HIM HIS VISITS WERE THEY KNOWN WOULD EXCITE SUSPICION BID HIM ON HIS RETURN WATCH CLOSELY TO SEE THAT HE IS NOT FOLLOWED AND TELL HIM TO GO BY DEVIOUS WINDINGS AND TO MIX IN THE THICKEST CROWDS
8573-286306-0037 IN ORDER TO THROW ANY ONE WHO MAY BE FOLLOWING OFF HIS TRACK BEFORE HE REJOINS YOU I TRUST TO BE ABLE TO ARRANGE FOR A SHIP IN THE COURSE OF THREE OR FOUR DAYS COME AGAIN AND SEE ME BEFORE YOU LEAVE HERE IS A BAG OF GOLD YOU WILL NEED IT TO REWARD THOSE WHO HAVE ASSISTED IN YOUR ESCAPE
8573-286306-0038 AND THANKING MANON FOR HIS KINDNESS HE RETURNED WITH NESSUS WHO HAD BEEN WAITING WITHOUT AS THEY WALKED ALONG MALCHUS BRIEFLY RELATED TO HIS FOLLOWER THE SUBSTANCE OF HIS INTERVIEW WITH MANON SUDDENLY NESSUS STOPPED AND LISTENED AND THEN RESUMED HIS WALK
8573-286306-0039 I THINK WE ARE FOLLOWED MY LORD HE SAID ONE OF HANNO'S SPIES IN MANON'S HOUSEHOLD IS NO DOUBT SEEKING TO DISCOVER WHO ARE THE ARABS WHO HAVE PAID HIS MASTER A VISIT
8573-286306-0040 IF THE MAN BEHIND US BE HONEST HE WILL GO STRAIGHT ON IF HE BE A SPY HE WILL HESITATE AND STOP AT THE CORNER TO DECIDE WHICH OF US HE SHALL FOLLOW THEN I SHALL KNOW WHAT TO DO
8573-286306-0041 ACCORDINGLY AT THE NEXT CROSSROAD THEY CAME TO NESSUS TURNED DOWN AND CONCEALED HIMSELF A FEW PACES AWAY
8573-286306-0042 A MINUTE LATER NESSUS SAW A DARK FIGURE COME STEALTHILY ALONG HE STOPPED AT THE JUNCTION OF THE ROADS AND STOOD FOR A FEW SECONDS IN HESITATION
8573-286306-0043 NESSUS ISSUED FROM HIS HIDING PLACE AND WITH STEPS AS SILENT AND STEALTHY AS THOSE OF A TIGER TRACKING HIS PREY FOLLOWED THE MAN WHEN WITHIN A FEW PACES OF HIM HE GAVE A SUDDEN SPRING AND FLUNG HIMSELF UPON HIM
8573-286306-0044 BURYING HIS KNIFE BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS WITHOUT A SOUND THE MAN FELL FORWARD ON HIS FACE NESSUS COOLLY WIPED HIS KNIFE UPON THE GARMENTS OF THE SPY AND THEN PROCEEDED AT A RAPID PACE UNTIL HE OVERTOOK MALCHUS IT WAS A SPY HE SAID
8573-286306-0045 BUT HE WILL CARRY NO MORE TALES TO HANNO TWO DAYS LATER NESSUS ON HIS RETURN FROM HIS VISIT TO MANON BROUGHT NEWS THAT THE LATTER HAD ARRANGED WITH THE CAPTAIN OF A SHIP OWNED BY A FRIEND TO CARRY THEM ACROSS TO CORINTH
8573-286306-0046 WHENCE THEY WOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN TAKING A PASSAGE TO ITALY THEY WERE TO GO ON BOARD LATE THE FOLLOWING NIGHT AND THE SHIP WOULD SET SAIL AT DAYBREAK
8573-286306-0047 PAID A FAREWELL VISIT TO MANON AND REPEATED TO HIM ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS OF HANNIBAL AND MANON HANDED HIM HIS LETTER FOR THE GENERAL AND AGAIN ASSURED HIM THAT HE WOULD WITH HIS FRIENDS AT ONCE SET TO WORK TO PAVE THE WAY FOR AN APPEAL TO THE POPULACE AT THE FIRST FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY
8573-286306-0048 IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY HE HAD PROVIDED HIMSELF WITH THE GARMENTS OF A TRADER THE CHARACTER WHICH HE WAS NOW ABOUT TO ASSUME AT MIDNIGHT WHEN ALL WAS QUIET HE AND NESSUS SET OUT AND MADE THEIR WAY DOWN TO THE PORT WHERE
8573-286306-0049 AT A LITTLE FREQUENTED LANDING STAGE A BOAT WAS AWAITING THEM AND THEY WERE AT ONCE ROWED TO THE SHIP WHICH WAS LYING AT ANCHOR HALF A MILE FROM THE SHORE IN READINESS FOR AN EARLY START IN THE MORNING ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN TRACED
8573-286306-0050 LISTENING TO EVERY SOUND AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE ANCHOR WAS WEIGHED THE SAILS HOISTED AND THE VESSEL BEGAN TO DRAW AWAY FROM CARTHAGE THAT HE WENT INTO HIS CABIN ON THE SIXTH DAY AFTER LEAVING CARTHAGE THE SHIP ENTERED THE PORT OF CORINTH
8573-286306-0051 THERE WERE SEVERAL VESSELS THERE FROM ITALIAN PORTS BUT BEFORE PROCEEDING TO ARRANGE FOR A PASSAGE MALCHUS WENT TO A SHOP AND BOUGHT FOR HIMSELF AND NESSUS SUCH CLOTHING AND ARMS AS WOULD ENABLE THEM TO PASS WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
8573-286306-0052 AS FIGHTING MEN BELONGING TO ONE OF THE LATIN TRIBES THEN HE MADE INQUIRIES ON THE QUAY AND FINDING THAT A SMALL ITALIAN CRAFT WAS TO START THAT AFTERNOON FOR BRUNDUSIUM HE WENT ON BOARD AND ACCOSTED THE CAPTAIN
8573-286306-0053 WE WANT TO CROSS TO ITALY HE SAID BUT WE HAVE OUR REASONS FOR NOT WISHING TO LAND AT BRUNDUSIUM AND WOULD FAIN BE PUT ASHORE AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE TOWN WE ARE READY OF COURSE TO PAY EXTRA FOR THE TROUBLE THE REQUEST DID NOT SEEM STRANGE TO THE CAPTAIN
8573-286306-0054 THE LANGUAGE WITH WHICH ALL WHO TRADED ON THE MEDITERRANEAN WERE FAMILIAR HE SUPPOSED THAT THEY HAD IN SOME WAY EMBROILED THEMSELVES WITH THE AUTHORITIES AT BRUNDUSIUM AND HAD FLED FOR AWHILE UNTIL THE MATTER BLEW OVER
8573-286306-0055 HE ASKED RATHER A HIGH PRICE FOR PUTTING THEM ASHORE IN A BOAT AS THEY WISHED
8573-286306-0056 AS A READINESS TO PAY AN EXORBITANT PRICE MIGHT HAVE GIVEN RISE TO DOUBTS IN THE CAPTAIN'S MIND AS TO THE QUALITY OF HIS PASSENGERS ONCE OR TWICE HE MADE AS IF HE WOULD GO ASHORE AND THE CAPTAIN AT LAST ABATED HIS DEMANDS TO A REASONABLE SUM WHEN THIS WAS SETTLED
8573-286306-0057 BUT REMAINED ON BOARD UNTIL THE VESSEL SAILED AS HE FEARED THAT HE MIGHT AGAIN BE RECOGNIZED BY SOME OF THE SAILORS OF THE CARTHAGINIAN VESSELS IN PORT THE WEATHER WAS FAIR AND THE WIND LIGHT AND ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER SAILING
8573-286306-0058 THEY HAD BEFORE EMBARKING LAID IN A STORE OF PROVISIONS NOT ONLY FOR A VOYAGE BUT FOR THEIR JOURNEY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS THE SLIGHT KNOWLEDGE WHICH MALCHUS HAD OF THE LATIN TONGUE WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIM AT ONCE WERE HE OBLIGED TO ENTER A TOWN OR VILLAGE TO PURCHASE FOOD
8573-286306-0059 CARRYING THE PROVISIONS IN BUNDLES THEY MADE FOR THE MOUNTAINS AND AFTER THREE DAYS JOURNEY REACHED WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR ADVENTURE THE CAMP OF HANNIBAL HE WAS STILL LYING IN HIS INTRENCHED CAMP NEAR GERONIUM
8573-286306-0060 THE ROMAN ARMY WAS AS BEFORE WATCHING HIM AT A SHORT DISTANCE OFF MALCHUS AT ONCE SOUGHT THE TENT OF THE GENERAL WHOSE SURPRISE AT SEEING HIM ENTER WAS GREAT FOR HE HAD NOT EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD RETURN UNTIL THE SPRING
8573-286306-0061 MALCHUS GAVE HIM AN ACCOUNT OF ALL THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE SINCE HE LEFT HIM HANNIBAL WAS INDIGNANT IN THE EXTREME AT HANNO HAVING VENTURED TO ARREST AND CONDEMN HIS AMBASSADOR WHEN HE LEARNED THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW WITH MANON
8573-286306-0062 AND HEARD HOW COMPLETELY THE HOSTILE FACTION WERE THE MASTERS OF CARTHAGE HE AGREED THAT THE COUNSELS OF THE OLD NOBLEMAN WERE WISE AND THAT MALCHUS COULD HAVE DONE NO GOOD WHEREAS HE WOULD HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH
8573-286306-0063 BY ENDEAVOURING FURTHER TO CARRY OUT THE MISSION WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN CHARGED MANON KNOWS WHAT IS BEST AND NO DOUBT A PREMATURE ATTEMPT TO EXCITE THE POPULACE TO FORCE HANNO INTO SENDING THE REINFORCEMENTS WE SO MUCH NEED WOULD HAVE NOT ONLY FAILED
8573-286306-0064 BUT WOULD HAVE INJURED OUR CAUSE HE AND HIS FRIENDS WILL DOUBTLESS WORK QUIETLY TO PREPARE THE PUBLIC MIND AND I TRUST THAT ERE VERY LONG SOME DECISIVE VICTORY WILL GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY FOR EXCITING A GREAT DEMONSTRATION ON OUR BEHALF
8573-286306-0065 THE REMAINDER OF THE WINTER PASSED QUIETLY MALCHUS RESUMED HIS POST AS THE COMMANDER OF HANNIBAL'S BODYGUARD BUT HIS DUTIES WERE VERY LIGHT THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME WAS SPENT IN ACCOMPANYING HANNIBAL IN HIS VISITS TO THE CAMPS OF THE SOLDIERS
8573-286306-0066 WHERE NOTHING WAS LEFT UNDONE WHICH COULD ADD TO THE COMFORT AND CONTENTMENT OF THE TROOPS THERE IS NO STRONGER EVIDENCE OF THE POPULARITY OF HANNIBAL AND OF THE INFLUENCE WHICH HE EXERCISED OVER HIS TROOPS THAN THE FACT THAT THE ARMY UNDER HIM
8573-286306-0067 COMPOSED AS IT WAS OF MEN OF SO MANY NATIONALITIES FOR THE MOST PART ORIGINALLY COMPELLED AGAINST THEIR WILL TO ENTER THE SERVICE OF CARTHAGE MAINTAINED THEIR DISCIPLINE UNSHAKEN NOT ONLY BY THE HARDSHIPS AND SACRIFICES OF THE CAMPAIGNS
8573-286306-0068 BUT THROUGH THE LONG PERIODS OF ENFORCED IDLENESS IN THEIR WINTER QUARTERS FROM FIRST TO LAST THROUGH THE LONG WAR THERE WAS NEITHER GRUMBLING NOR DISCONTENT NOR INSUBORDINATION AMONG THE TROOPS THEY SERVED WILLINGLY AND CHEERFULLY
8573-286306-0069 THEY HAD ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR GENERAL AND WERE WILLING TO UNDERTAKE THE MOST TREMENDOUS LABOURS AND TO ENGAGE IN THE MOST ARDUOUS CONFLICTS TO PLEASE HIM KNOWING THAT HE ON HIS PART
8573-286306-0070 WAS UNWEARIED IN PROMOTING THEIR COMFORT AND WELL BEING AT ALL OTHER TIMES AS THE SPRING ADVANCED THE GREAT MAGAZINES WHICH HANNIBAL HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM BECAME NEARLY EXHAUSTED AND NO PROVISIONS COULD BE OBTAINED FROM THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY
8573-286306-0071 WHICH HAD BEEN COMPLETELY RUINED BY THE LONG PRESENCE OF THE TWO ARMIES IT BECAME THEREFORE NECESSARY TO MOVE FROM THE POSITION WHICH HE HAD OCCUPIED DURING THE WINTER THE ROMANS POSSESSED THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF HAVING MAGAZINES IN THEIR REAR
8573-286306-0072 CONSTANTLY REPLENISHED BY THEIR ALLIES AND MOVE WHERE THEY MIGHT THEY WERE SURE OF OBTAINING SUBSISTENCE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THUS UPON THE MARCH THEY WERE UNEMBARRASSED BY THE NECESSITY OF TAKING A GREAT BAGGAGE TRAIN WITH THEM AND WHEN HALTED
8573-286306-0073 THEIR GENERAL COULD KEEP HIS ARMY TOGETHER IN READINESS TO STRIKE A BLOW WHENEVER AN OPPORTUNITY OFFERED WHILE HANNIBAL ON THE OTHER HAND WAS FORCED TO SCATTER A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE ARMY IN SEARCH OF PROVISIONS
8573-286306-0074 THE ANNUAL ELECTIONS AT ROME HAD JUST TAKEN PLACE AND TERENTIUS VARRO AND EMILIUS PAULUS HAD BEEN CHOSEN CONSULS EMILIUS BELONGED TO THE ARISTOCRATIC PARTY
8573-286306-0075 AND HAD GIVEN PROOF OF MILITARY ABILITY THREE YEARS BEFORE WHEN HE HAD COMMANDED AS CONSUL IN THE ILLYRIAN WAR VARRO BELONGED TO THE POPULAR PARTY
8573-286306-0076 AS A COARSE AND BRUTAL DEMAGOGUE THE SON OF A BUTCHER AND HAVING HIMSELF BEEN A BUTCHER BUT HE WAS UNQUESTIONABLY AN ABLE MAN AND POSSESSED SOME GREAT QUALITIES THE PRAETOR MARCELLUS
8573-286306-0077 WHILE ANOTHER PRAETOR LUCIUS POSTUMIUS WITH ONE LEGION WAS IN CISALPINE GAUL KEEPING DOWN THE TRIBES FRIENDLY TO CARTHAGE BUT BEFORE THE NEW CONSULS ARRIVED TO TAKE THE COMMAND OF THE ARMY HANNIBAL HAD MOVED FROM GERONIUM
8573-286306-0078 THE GREAT ROMAN MAGAZINE OF APULIA WAS AT CANNAE A TOWN NEAR THE RIVER AULIDUS THIS IMPORTANT PLACE WAS BUT FIFTY MILES BY THE SHORTEST ROUTE ACROSS THE PLAIN FROM GERONIUM BUT THE ROMANS WERE UNABLE TO FOLLOW DIRECTLY ACROSS THE PLAIN
8573-286306-0079 FOR AT THIS TIME THE CARTHAGINIANS GREATLY OUTNUMBERED THEM IN CAVALRY AND THEY WOULD THEREFORE HAVE TO TAKE THE ROAD ROUND THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS WHICH WAS NEARLY SEVENTY MILES LONG AND YET BY SOME UNACCOUNTABLE BLUNDER
8573-286306-0080 THEY NEGLECTED TO PLACE A SUFFICIENT GUARD OVER THEIR GREAT MAGAZINES AT CANNAE TO DEFEND THEM FOR EVEN A FEW DAYS AGAINST A SUDDEN ATTACK HANNIBAL SAW THE OPPORTUNITY AND WHEN SPRING WAS PASSING INTO SUMMER
8573-286306-0081 WHERE THE VAST MAGAZINES OF THE ROMANS AT ONCE FELL INTO HIS HANDS HE THUS NOT ONLY OBTAINED POSSESSION OF HIS ENEMY'S SUPPLIES BUT INTERPOSED BETWEEN THE ROMANS AND THE LOW LYING DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN APULIA WHERE ALONE AT THIS EARLY SEASON OF THE YEAR
8573-286306-0082 THE CORN WAS FULLY RIPE THE ROMANS HAD NOW NO CHOICE BUT TO ADVANCE AND FIGHT A BATTLE FOR THE RECOVERY OF THEIR MAGAZINES FOR HAD THEY RETIRED THE APULIANS WHO HAD ALREADY SUFFERED TERRIBLY FROM THE WAR
8573-286306-0083 WOULD IN SHEER DESPAIR HAVE BEEN FORCED TO DECLARE FOR CARTHAGE
8573-286306-0084 WHILE HANNIBAL COULD VICTUAL HIS ARMY FROM THE COUNTRY BEHIND HIM THE SENATE THEREFORE HAVING LARGELY REINFORCED THE ARMY ORDERED THE CONSULS TO ADVANCE AND GIVE BATTLE
8573-286306-0085 THEY HAD UNDER THEM EIGHT FULL LEGIONS OR EIGHTY THOUSAND INFANTRY AND SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED CAVALRY TO OPPOSE THESE HANNIBAL HAD FORTY THOUSAND INFANTRY AND TEN THOUSAND EXCELLENT CAVALRY OF WHOM TWO THOUSAND WERE NUMIDIANS
8573-286306-0086 ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER LEAVING THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF GERONIUM THE ROMANS ENCAMPED AT A DISTANCE OF SIX MILES FROM THE CARTHAGINIANS HERE THE USUAL DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AT ONCE AROSE BETWEEN THE ROMAN CONSULS WHO COMMANDED THE ARMY ON ALTERNATE DAYS
8573-286306-0087 VARRO WISHED TO MARCH AGAINST THE ENEMY WITHOUT DELAY WHILE EMILIUS WAS ADVERSE TO RISKING AN ENGAGEMENT IN A COUNTRY WHICH BEING LEVEL AND OPEN WAS FAVOURABLE TO THE ACTION OF HANNIBAL'S SUPERIOR CAVALRY
8573-286306-0088 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY VARRO WHOSE TURN IT WAS TO COMMAND MARCHED TOWARDS THE HOSTILE CAMP HANNIBAL ATTACKED THE ROMAN ADVANCED GUARD WITH HIS CAVALRY AND LIGHT INFANTRY BUT VARRO HAD SUPPORTED HIS CAVALRY NOT ONLY BY HIS LIGHT TROOPS
8573-286306-0089 BUT BY A STRONG BODY OF HIS HEAVY ARMED INFANTRY AND AFTER AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH LASTED FOR SEVERAL HOURS HE REPULSED THE CARTHAGINIANS WITH CONSIDERABLE LOSS THAT EVENING THE ROMAN ARMY ENCAMPED ABOUT THREE MILES FROM CANNAE
8573-286306-0090 ON THE RIGHT BANK OF THE AUFIDUS THE NEXT MORNING EMILIUS WHO WAS IN COMMAND DETACHED A THIRD OF HIS FORCE ACROSS THE RIVER AND ENCAMPED THEM THERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUPPORTING THE ROMAN FORAGING PARTIES ON THAT SIDE AND OF INTERRUPTING THOSE OF THE CARTHAGINIANS
8573-286306-0091 THE NEXT DAY PASSED QUIETLY BUT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HANNIBAL QUITTED HIS CAMP AND FORMED HIS ARMY IN ORDER OF BATTLE TO TEMPT THE ROMANS TO ATTACK BUT EMILIUS SENSIBLE THAT THE GROUND WAS AGAINST HIM WOULD NOT MOVE
8573-286306-0092 BUT CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH FURTHER STRENGTHENING HIS CAMPS HANNIBAL SEEING THAT THE ROMANS WOULD NOT FIGHT DETACHED HIS NUMIDIAN CAVALRY ACROSS THE RIVER TO CUT OFF THE ROMAN FORAGING PARTIES AND TO SURROUND AND HARASS THEIR SMALLER CAMP ON THAT SIDE OF THE RIVER
8573-286306-0093 AND FORMED IT IN ORDER OF BATTLE LEAVING EIGHT THOUSAND OF HIS MEN TO GUARD HIS CAMP BY THUS DOING HE OBTAINED A POSITION WHICH HE COULD THE BETTER HOLD WITH HIS INFERIOR FORCES WHILE THE ROMANS DEEMING THAT HE INTENDED TO ATTACK THEIR CAMP ON THAT SIDE OF THE RIVER
8573-286306-0094 WOULD BE LIKELY TO MOVE THEIR WHOLE ARMY ACROSS AND TO GIVE BATTLE THIS IN FACT VARRO PROCEEDED TO DO LEAVING TEN THOUSAND MEN IN HIS OWN CAMP WITH ORDERS TO MARCH OUT AND ATTACK THAT OF HANNIBAL DURING THE ENGAGEMENT HE LED THE REST OF HIS TROOPS OVER THE RIVER
8573-286306-0095 AND HAVING UNITED HIS FORCE WITH THAT IN THE CAMP ON THE RIGHT BANK MARCHED DOWN THE RIVER UNTIL HE FACED THE POSITION WHICH HANNIBAL HAD TAKEN UP THIS HAD BEEN SKILLFULLY CHOSEN THE RIVER WHOSE GENERAL COURSE WAS EAST AND WEST MADE A LOOP
8573-286306-0096 AND ACROSS THIS HANNIBAL HAD DRAWN UP HIS ARMY WITH BOTH WINGS RESTING UPON THE RIVER THUS THE ROMANS COULD NOT OUTFLANK HIM AND THE EFFECT OF THEIR VASTLY SUPERIOR NUMBERS IN INFANTRY WOULD TO SOME EXTENT BE NEUTRALIZED
8573-286306-0097 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE DISPOSITION OF HIS TROOPS THE SPANIARDS AND GAULS OCCUPIED THE CENTRE OF THE LINE OF INFANTRY THE AFRICANS FORMED THE TWO WINGS ON HIS LEFT FLANK BETWEEN THE AFRICANS AND THE RIVER HE PLACED HIS HEAVY AFRICAN AND GAULISH HORSE
8573-286306-0098 EIGHT THOUSAND STRONG WHILE THE TWO THOUSAND NUMIDIANS WERE POSTED BETWEEN THE INFANTRY AND THE RIVER ON THE RIGHT FLANK HANNIBAL COMMANDED THE CENTRE OF THE ARMY IN PERSON HANNO THE RIGHT WING HASDRUBAL THE LEFT WING MAHARBAL COMMANDED THE CAVALRY
8573-286306-0099 VARRO PLACED HIS INFANTRY IN CLOSE AND HEAVY ORDER SO AS TO REDUCE THEIR FRONT TO THAT OF THE CARTHAGINIANS THE ROMAN CAVALRY NUMBERING TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED MEN WAS ON HIS RIGHT WING AND WAS THUS OPPOSED TO HANNIBAL'S HEAVY CAVALRY EIGHT THOUSAND STRONG
8573-286306-0100 FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED STRONG WAS ON THE LEFT WING FACING THE NUMIDIANS EMILIUS COMMANDED THE ROMAN RIGHT VARRO THE LEFT THE CARTHAGINIANS FACED NORTH SO THAT THE WIND WHICH WAS BLOWING STRONGLY FROM THE SOUTH
8573-286306-0101 SWEPT CLOUDS OF DUST OVER THEIR HEADS FULL INTO THE FACES OF THE ENEMY THE BATTLE WAS COMMENCED BY THE LIGHT TROOPS ON BOTH SIDES WHO FOUGHT FOR SOME TIME OBSTINATELY AND COURAGEOUSLY BUT WITHOUT ANY ADVANTAGE TO EITHER
8573-286306-0102 WHILE THIS CONTEST WAS GOING ON HANNIBAL ADVANCED HIS CENTRE SO AS TO FORM A SALIENT ANGLE PROJECTING IN FRONT OF HIS LINE THE WHOLE OF THE GAULS AND SPANIARDS TOOK PART IN THIS MOVEMENT WHILE THE AFRICANS REMAINED STATIONARY
8573-286306-0103 AT THE SAME TIME HE LAUNCHED HIS HEAVY CAVALRY AGAINST THE ROMAN HORSE THE LATTER WERE INSTANTLY OVERTHROWN AND WERE DRIVEN FROM THE FIELD WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER EMILIUS HIMSELF WAS WOUNDED BUT MANAGED TO JOIN THE INFANTRY
8573-286306-0104 WHILE THE CARTHAGINIAN HEAVY HORSE WERE THUS DEFEATING THE ROMAN CAVALRY THE NUMIDIANS MANEUVERED NEAR THE GREATLY SUPERIOR CAVALRY OF THE ITALIAN ALLIES AND KEPT THEM OCCUPIED UNTIL THE HEAVY HORSE AFTER DESTROYING THE ROMAN CAVALRY
8573-286306-0105 SWEPT ROUND BEHIND THEIR INFANTRY AND FELL UPON THE REAR OF THE ITALIAN HORSE WHILE THE NUMIDIANS CHARGED THEM FIERCELY IN FRONT THUS CAUGHT IN A TRAP THE ITALIAN HORSE WERE COMPLETELY ANNIHILATED AND SO BEFORE THE HEAVY INFANTRY OF THE TWO ARMIES MET EACH OTHER
8573-286306-0106 NOT A ROMAN CAVALRY SOLDIER REMAINED ALIVE AND UNWOUNDED ON THE FIELD THE ROMAN INFANTRY NOW ADVANCED TO THE CHARGE AND FROM THE NATURE OF HANNIBAL'S FORMATION THEIR CENTRE FIRST CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE HEAD OF THE SALIENT ANGLE
8573-286306-0107 FORMED BY THE GAULS AND SPANIARDS THESE RESISTED WITH GREAT OBSTINACY THE PRINCIPES WHO FORMED THE SECOND LINE OF THE ROMAN INFANTRY CAME FORWARD AND JOINED THE SPEARMEN AND EVEN THE TRIARII PRESSED FORWARD AND JOINED IN THE FIGHT
8573-286306-0108 FIGHTING WITH EXTREME OBSTINACY THE CARTHAGINIAN CENTRE WAS FORCED GRADUALLY BACK UNTIL THEY WERE AGAIN IN A LINE WITH THE AFRICANS ON THEIR FLANKS THE ROMANS HAD INSENSIBLY PRESSED IN FROM BOTH FLANKS UPON THE POINT WHERE THEY HAD MET WITH RESISTANCE
8573-286306-0109 STILL FURTHER THE GAULS AND SPANIARDS WERE DRIVEN BACK UNTIL THEY NOW FORMED AN ANGLE IN REAR OF THE ORIGINAL LINE AND IN THIS ANGLE THE WHOLE OF THE ROMAN INFANTRY IN A CONFUSED MASS PRESSED UPON THEM THIS WAS THE MOMENT FOR WHICH HANNIBAL HAD WAITED
8573-286306-0110 HE WHEELED ROUND BOTH HIS FLANKS AND THE AFRICANS WHO HAD HITHERTO NOT STRUCK A BLOW NOW FELL IN PERFECT ORDER UPON THE FLANKS OF THE ROMAN MASS WHILE HASDRUBAL WITH HIS VICTORIOUS CAVALRY CHARGED DOWN LIKE A TORRENT UPON THEIR REAR
8573-286306-0111 THEN FOLLOWED A SLAUGHTER UNEQUALLED IN THE RECORDS OF HISTORY UNABLE TO OPEN OUT TO FIGHT OR TO FLY WITH NO QUARTER ASKED OR GIVEN THE ROMANS AND THEIR LATIN ALLIES FELL BEFORE THE SWORDS OF THEIR ENEMIES TILL
8573-286306-0112 OF THE SEVENTY THOUSAND INFANTRY WHICH HAD ADVANCED TO THE FIGHT FORTY THOUSAND HAD FALLEN ON THE FIELD THREE THOUSAND WERE TAKEN PRISONERS SEVEN THOUSAND ESCAPED TO THE SMALL CAMP AND TEN THOUSAND MADE THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RIVER TO THE LARGE CAMP
8573-286306-0113 WHERE THEY JOINED THE FORCE WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT THERE AND WHICH HAD IN OBEDIENCE TO VARRO'S ORDERS ATTACKED THE CARTHAGINIAN CAMP BUT HAD BEEN REPULSED WITH A LOSS OF TWO THOUSAND MEN ALL THE TROOPS IN BOTH CAMPS WERE FORCED TO SURRENDER ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
