7752-113336-0000 CHARLES DICKENS CHARLES JOHN HUFFHAM DICKENS THE MASTER STORY TELLER WAS BORN IN LANDPORT ENGLAND FEBRUARY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN TWELVE
7752-113336-0001 HIS FATHER WAS A CLERK IN ONE OF THE OFFICES OF THE NAVY AND HE WAS ONE OF EIGHT CHILDREN WHEN HE WAS FOUR YEARS OLD HIS FATHER MOVED TO THE TOWN OF CHATHAM NEAR THE OLD CITY OF ROCHESTER
7752-113336-0002 ROUND ABOUT ARE CHALK HILLS GREEN LANES FORESTS AND MARSHES AND AMID SUCH SCENES THE LITTLE CHARLES'S GENIUS FIRST BEGAN TO SHOW ITSELF HE DID NOT LIKE THE ROUGHER SPORTS OF HIS SCHOOL FELLOWS
7752-113336-0003 AND PREFERRED TO AMUSE HIMSELF IN HIS OWN WAY OR TO WANDER ABOUT WITH HIS OLDER SISTER FANNY WHOM HE ESPECIALLY LOVED THEY LOVED TO WATCH THE STARS TOGETHER AND THERE WAS ONE PARTICULAR STAR WHICH THEY USED TO PRETEND WAS THEIR OWN
7752-113336-0004 AND ROBINSON CRUSOE HE HAD A GREAT AFFECTION FOR CHATHAM AND ROCHESTER AND AFTER HE BEGAN TO WRITE STORIES THAT WERE PRINTED HE OFTEN USED TO PUT THESE PLACES INTO THEM
7752-113336-0005 RODE WITH JINGLE ROCHESTER WAS REALLY THE CLOISTERHAM WHERE THE WICKED CHOIR MASTER JOHN JASPER KILLED HIS NEPHEW IN THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD AND IT WAS IN THOSE VERY MARSHES NEAR BY THAT MAGWITCH
7752-113336-0006 THE ESCAPED CONVICT IN GREAT EXPECTATIONS SO FRIGHTENED LITTLE PIP IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT THE YOUNG CHARLES DICKENS NOTED CAREFULLY AND REMEMBERED EVERYTHING HE SAW AND THIS HABIT WAS OF GREAT USE TO HIM ALL HIS LIFE
7752-113336-0007 THESE HAPPY YEARS WERE NOT TO LAST LONG WHEN HE WAS NINE YEARS OLD HIS FATHER BECAME POOR AND THE FAMILY WAS OBLIGED TO MOVE TO LONDON WHERE IT LIVED IN A SHABBY HOUSE IN A POOR SUBURB
7752-113336-0008 HIS FATHER WAS PUT INTO PRISON FOR DEBT THE SAME PRISON IN WHICH LITTLE DORRIT IN THE STORY OF THAT NAME GREW UP A VERY BITTER PERIOD FOLLOWED FOR THE SOLITARY TEN YEAR OLD BOY A TIME IN WHICH HE LONG AFTERWARD WROTE
7752-113336-0009 BUT FOR THE MERCY OF GOD HE MIGHT EASILY HAVE BECOME FOR ANY CARE THAT WAS TAKEN OF HIM A LITTLE ROBBER OR A LITTLE VAGABOND THE EARLIER HISTORY OF DAVID IN DAVID COPPERFIELD IS REALLY AND TRULY A HISTORY OF THE REAL CHARLES DICKENS IN LONDON
7752-113336-0010 DICKENS'S LIFE AT THIS TIME WAS SO MISERABLE THAT ALWAYS AFTERWARD HE DREADED TO SPEAK OF IT AND NEVER COULD BEAR EVEN TO WALK IN THE STREET WHERE THE BLACKING WAREHOUSE OF HIS BOYHOOD HAD STOOD
7752-113336-0011 BETTER DAYS HOWEVER CAME AT LAST HE WAS ABLE TO BEGIN SCHOOL AGAIN AND THOUGH THE HEAD MASTER WAS IGNORANT AND BRUTAL JUST SUCH A ONE AS MISTER CREAKLE IN DAVID COPPERFIELD YET DICKENS PROFITED BY SUCH TEACHING AS HE RECEIVED
7752-113336-0012 THIS WAS BY NO MEANS AN EASY TASK BUT DICKENS HAD GREAT STRENGTH OF WILL AND A DETERMINATION TO DO WELL WHATEVER HE DID AT ALL AND HE SUCCEEDED JUST AS DAVID COPPERFIELD DID IN THE STORY
7752-113336-0013 AT MISTER CRUMMLES'S THEATER BUT HIS ACTING WAS FOR HIS OWN AMUSEMENT AND IT IS DOUBTFUL IF HE EVER THOUGHT SERIOUSLY OF ADOPTING THE STAGE AS A PROFESSION IF HE DID HIS SUCCESS AS A REPORTER SOON DETERMINED HIM OTHERWISE
7752-113336-0014 AND READ IT NOW THROUGH TEARS OF JOY AND PRIDE HE FOLLOWED THIS WITH OTHERS AS SUCCESSFUL
7752-113336-0015 PERHAPS INDEED THE MOST POPULAR BOOK EVER PUBLISHED IN ENGLAND SOON AFTER THE APPEARANCE OF ITS FIRST CHAPTERS DICKENS MARRIED MISS CATHERINE HOGARTH DAUGHTER OF THE EDITOR OF ONE OF THE LONDON NEWSPAPERS WHO HAD HELPED HIM IN HIS CAREER
7752-113336-0016 CERTAINLY ITS HONEST FUN ITS MERRIMENT ITS QUAINTNESS GOOD HUMOR AND CHARITY APPEALED TO EVERY READER MORE THAN ALL IT MADE PEOPLE ACQUAINTED WITH A NEW COMPANY OF CHARACTERS NONE OF WHOM HAD EVER EXISTED OR COULD EVER EXIST
7752-113336-0017 AND YET WHOSE MANNERS AND APPEARANCE WERE PICTURED SO REALLY THAT THEY SEEMED TO BE ACTUAL PERSONS WHOM ONE MIGHT MEET AND LAUGH WITH ANYWHERE WITH SUCH A SUCCESS AND THE MONEY IT BROUGHT HIM DICKENS HAD LEISURE TO BEGIN THE WONDERFUL SERIES OF STORIES
7752-113336-0018 WHICH ENDEARED HIM TO THE WHOLE ENGLISH SPEAKING WORLD AND MADE HIM THE MOST FAMOUS AUTHOR OF HIS DAY OLIVER TWIST CAME FIRST AND IT WAS FOLLOWED BY NICHOLAS NICKLEBY AND THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP
7752-113336-0019 IN THE FIRST TWO OF THESE STORIES ONE MAY SEE MOST CLEARLY THE PRINCIPLE THAT UNDERLAY ALMOST ALL OF DICKENS'S WORK HE WAS NEVER CONTENT MERELY TO TELL AN INTERESTING STORY HE WROTE WITH A PURPOSE
7752-113336-0020 NUMBERS OF WHICH AT THAT TIME WERE MANAGED BY MEN ALMOST AS CRUEL AND INHUMAN AS WAS SQUEERS IN THE STORY IT IS GOOD TO LEARN THAT AS A RESULT OF THIS NOVEL AN END WAS MADE OF MANY SUCH BOYS SCHOOLS
7752-113336-0021 WITHOUT REALIZING HOW MUCH WRONG AND MISERY WAS CAUSED BY THE LAW WHICH MADE IT POSSIBLE TO THROW A MAN INTO PRISON FOR DEBT NOR CAN ONE READ BLEAK HOUSE WITHOUT SEEING THAT THE LEGAL SYSTEM WHICH ROBBED QUAINT MISS FLITE OF HER MIND
7752-113336-0022 AND KEPT POOR RICHARD CARSTONE FROM HIS FORTUNE TILL THE FORTUNE ITSELF HAD DISAPPEARED WAS A VERY WRONG LEGAL SYSTEM INDEED OFTEN TOO DICKENS'S STORIES ARE IN A SENSE SERMONS AGAINST VERY HUMAN SINS
7752-113336-0023 THE EVIL AND FOLLY OF SELFISHNESS IS WHAT DICKENS HAD IN MIND WITH HIS INCREASING WEALTH DICKENS HAD OF COURSE CHANGED HIS MANNER OF LIFE HE LIVED PART OF THE TIME IN THE COUNTRY NEAR LONDON IN BRIGHTON IN DOVER AND IN FRANCE AND ITALY
7752-113336-0024 HE LIKED BEST HOWEVER A LITTLE ENGLISH WATERING PLACE CALLED BROADSTAIRS A TINY FISHING VILLAGE BUILT ON A CLIFF WITH THE SEA ROLLING AND DASHING BENEATH IT
7752-113336-0025 BUT HE GREATLY MISSED HIS LONDON FRIENDS HE USED TO SAY THAT BEING WITHOUT THEM WAS LIKE LOSING HIS ARMS AND LEGS THE FIRST GREAT GRIEF OF HIS LIFE CAME TO HIM AT THIS TIME IN THE DEATH OF HIS WIFE'S SISTER MARY HOGARTH
7752-113336-0026 A GENTLE LOVABLE GIRL OF SEVENTEEN NO SORROW EVER TOUCHED HIM AS THIS DID AFTER SHE DIED HE WROTE YEARS AFTERWARD I DREAMED OF HER EVERY NIGHT FOR MANY WEEKS AND ALWAYS WITH A KIND OF QUIET HAPPINESS
7752-113336-0027 SO THAT I NEVER LAY DOWN AT NIGHT WITHOUT A HOPE OF THE VISION COMING BACK HERS WAS THE CHARACTER HE DREW IN LITTLE NELL IN THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP WHEN HE CAME TO THE PART OF THE STORY WHICH TELLS OF LITTLE NELL'S DEATH
7752-113336-0028 HE DECIDED NOW TO VISIT THIS COUNTRY AND MEET HIS AMERICAN READERS FACE TO FACE HE LANDED AT BOSTON ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WIFE IN EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO AND VISITED MANY OF THE GREATER CITIES OF THE EASTERN STATES
7752-113336-0029 EVERYWHERE HE WAS COUNTED THE GUEST OF THE NATION AND THE FOUR MONTHS OF HIS STAY WERE ONE CONTINUAL WELCOME UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER DICKENS HAD TAKEN A DISLIKE TO AMERICAN WAYS AND THIS DISLIKE APPEARED IN MANY THINGS HE WROTE
7752-113336-0030 AFTER HIS RETURN TO ENGLAND THE PICTURES HE DREW OF AMERICAN LIFE IN MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT WERE BOTH UNJUST AND UNTRUE AND MADE HIM FOR A TIME LOSE A LARGE PART OF THE GOOD OPINION WHICH AMERICAN READERS HAD HAD FOR HIM
7752-113336-0031 DICKENS SOON CAME TO REGRET THE WRITING OF THESE CHAPTERS AND WHEN TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER HE VISITED THE UNITED STATES A SECOND TIME HE DID ALL IN HIS POWER TO SHOW HIS KINDLY FEELING AND AMERICA ADMIRED AND LOVED HIM SO MUCH THAT IT GRADUALLY FORGOT THE INCIDENT
7752-113336-0032 IN THE GREAT PLEASURE WITH WHICH IT READ HIS STORIES DICKENS WAS A VERY ACTIVE MAN AND HIS LIFE WAS SIMPLE AND FULL OF WORK AND EXERCISE HE ROSE EARLY AND ALMOST EVERY DAY MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN TRAMPING FOR MILES ALONG THE COUNTRY ROADS
7752-113336-0033 OR RIDING HORSEBACK WITH HIS DOGS RACING AFTER HIM HE LIKED BEST TO WANDER ALONG THE CLIFFS OR ACROSS THE DOWNS BY THE SEA WHEN HE WAS IN LONDON HE OFTEN WALKED THE STREETS HALF THE NIGHT THINKING OUT HIS STORIES
7752-113336-0034 OR SEARCHING FOR THE ODD CHARACTERS WHICH HE PUT IN THEM THIS NATURAL ACTIVITY AND RESTLESSNESS EVEN LED HIM SOMETIMES TO MAKE POLITICAL SPEECHES AND FINALLY TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW LONDON NEWSPAPER THE DAILY NEWS OF WHICH HE WAS THE FIRST EDITOR
7752-113336-0035 AND HE PRIDED HIMSELF ON HIS PUNCTUALITY HE COULD NOT WORK IN A ROOM UNLESS EVERYTHING IN IT WAS IN ITS PROPER PLACE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS HABIT OF REGULARITY HE NEVER WASTED TIME THE WORK OF EDITORSHIP WAS VERY PLEASANT TO DICKENS
7752-113336-0036 AND SCARCELY THREE YEARS AFTER HIS LEAVING THE DAILY NEWS HE BEGAN THE PUBLICATION OF A NEW MAGAZINE WHICH HE CALLED HOUSEHOLD WORDS HIS AIM WAS TO MAKE IT CHEERFUL USEFUL AND AT THE SAME TIME CHEAP SO THAT THE POOR COULD AFFORD TO BUY IT AS WELL AS THE RICH
7752-113336-0037 AS FROM THE MOST FAMOUS IT WAS WHILE ENGAGED IN THIS WORK THAT DICKENS WROTE THE BEST ONE OF ALL HIS TALES DAVID COPPERFIELD THE ONE WHICH IS IN SO LARGE A PART THE HISTORY OF HIS OWN EARLY LIFE THIS BOOK BROUGHT DICKENS TO THE HEIGHT OF HIS CAREER
7752-113336-0038 HE WAS NOW BOTH FAMOUS AND RICH HE BOUGHT A HOUSE ON GAD'S HILL A PLACE NEAR CHATHAM WHERE HE HAD SPENT THE HAPPIEST PART OF HIS CHILDHOOD AND SETTLED DOWN TO A LIFE OF COMFORT AND LABOR
7752-113336-0039 WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY HIS FATHER HAD POINTED OUT THIS FINE HOUSE TO HIM AND TOLD HIM HE MIGHT EVEN COME TO LIVE THERE SOME DAY IF HE WERE VERY PERSEVERING AND WORKED HARD AND SO INDEED IT HAD PROVED
7752-113336-0040 THAT THE WORLD OFTENEST REMEMBERS DICKENS NOW EVERYONE OLD AND YOUNG THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD LIKED HIM CHILDREN DOGS AND HORSES WERE HIS FRIENDS HIS HAND WAS OPEN FOR CHARITY
7752-113336-0041 UNKNOWN TO HIM A LITTLE CHILD OF HIS OWN WAS LYING DEAD AT HOME WITH SUCH A TENDER HEART FOR ALL THE WORLD HE WAS MORE THAN AN AFFECTIONATE FATHER TO HIS OWN CHILDREN AND GAVE MUCH THOUGHT TO THEIR HAPPINESS AND EDUCATION
7752-113336-0042 AS THE YEARS WENT BY HIS LETTERS TO HIS OLDEST SON TOLD OF HIS OWN WORK AND PLANS WHEN HIS YOUNGEST SON SAILED AWAY TO LIVE IN AUSTRALIA HE WROTE POOR PLORN IS GONE IT WAS A HARD PARTING AT THE LAST
7752-113336-0043 WHEN HE MOVED TO GAD'S HILL IT SEEMED AS THOUGH DICKENS HAD GAINED ALMOST ALL OF THE THINGS MEN STRIVE MOST FOR BUT HE WAS NOT TO BE HAPPY THERE NOR PERHAPS WAS HE EVER AGAIN TO BE REALLY HAPPY ANYWHERE
7752-113336-0044 HE AND HIS WIFE WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN ALL THEIR TASTES AND HABITS AND HAD NEVER LOVED EACH OTHER AS WELL AS PEOPLE SHOULD WHEN THEY MARRY PERHAPS AFTER ALL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF IN HIS YOUTH HE HAD MARRIED HIS DORA
7752-113336-0045 THE ONE WHOM HE HAD PICTURED IN THE LOVE STORY OF DAVID COPPERFIELD AND HIS CHILD WIFE BUT HOWEVER THIS MAY BE DICKENS AND HIS WIFE HAD NOT LIVED HAPPILY TOGETHER AND NOW DECIDED TO PART AND FROM THAT TIME THOUGH THEY WROTE TO EACH OTHER HE NEVER SAW HER AGAIN
7752-113336-0046 IT IS SAD TO REFLECT THAT HE WHO HAS PAINTED SO BEAUTIFULLY FOR OTHERS THE JOYS AND SORROWS OF PERFECT LOVE AND HOME WAS HIMSELF DESTINED TO KNOW NEITHER THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED THIS SEPARATION WERE YEARS OF CONSTANT LABOR FOR DICKENS
7752-113336-0047 THE IDEA OF GIVING PUBLIC READINGS FROM HIS STORIES SUGGESTED ITSELF TO HIM AND HE WAS SOON ENGAGED IN PREPARATION I MUST DO SOMETHING HE WROTE OR I SHALL WEAR MY HEART AWAY THAT HEART HIS PHYSICIAN HAD DECLARED OUT OF ORDER
7752-113336-0048 AND THIS EFFORT WAS DESTINED TO WEAR IT AWAY IN QUITE ANOTHER SENSE THOUGH FOR SOME TIME DICKENS FELT NO ILL EFFECTS HE GAVE READINGS NOT ONLY IN ENGLAND BUT ALSO IN SCOTLAND AND IRELAND AND EVERYWHERE HE MET WITH ENORMOUS SUCCESS
7752-113336-0049 THE FIRST SERIES WAS HARDLY OVER WHEN HE WAS AT WORK ON A NEW STORY AND THIS WAS SCARCELY COMPLETED WHEN HE WAS PLANNING MORE READINGS THE STRAIN OF SEVERAL SEASONS OF SUCH WORK TOLD ON HIS HEALTH A SERIOUS ILLNESS FOLLOWED
7752-113336-0050 A GREAT BANQUET OF FAREWELL WAS GIVEN TO HIM IN NEW YORK AND HE RETURNED TO ENGLAND BEARING THE ADMIRATION AND LOVE OF THE WHOLE AMERICAN PEOPLE BEFORE LEAVING ENGLAND HE HAD PROMISED TO GIVE ONE OTHER COURSE OF READINGS THERE AND THIS PROMISE
7752-113336-0051 HE ATTEMPTED TO FULFIL BUT HE WAS TOO ILL HE FOUND HIMSELF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE FEELING AS HE SAID GIDDY JARRED SHAKEN FAINT UNCERTAIN OF VOICE AND SIGHT AND TREAD AND TOUCH
7752-113336-0052 HE ATTEMPTED ONE MORE SERIES OF READINGS AND WITH THEIR CLOSE BADE FAREWELL FOR EVER TO HIS ENGLISH AUDIENCE
7752-113336-0053 AS HE SAT DOWN TO DINNER ALL PRESENT NOTICED THAT HE LOOKED VERY ILL THEY BEGGED HIM TO LIE DOWN YES ON THE GROUND HE SAID THESE WERE THE LAST WORDS HE EVER UTTERED AND AS HE SPOKE HE SLIPPED DOWN UPON THE FLOOR
