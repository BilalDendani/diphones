7069-246904-0000 NEAR THE FIREPLACE AND A DORMER WINDOW AS WELL THE LOW WALLS UP TO THE SLOPE WERE FILLED WITH BOOKS BOOKS LAY ON THE TABLE ON THE BED ON CHAIRS AND IN CORNERS EVERYWHERE AHA
7069-246904-0001 SAID WINGFOLD AS HE ENTERED AND CAST HIS EYES AROUND THERE IS NO ROOM FOR SURPRISE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE FOUND ME OUT SO EASILY MISTER POLWARTH HERE YOU HAVE A LEGION OF DETECTIVES FOR SUCH RASCALS
7069-246904-0002 THE LITTLE MAN TURNED AND FOR A MOMENT LOOKED AT HIM WITH A DOUBTFUL AND SOMEWHAT PAINED EXPRESSION AS IF HE HAD NOT BEEN PREPARED FOR SUCH AN ENTRANCE ON A SOLEMN QUESTION
7069-246904-0003 IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU SIR TO TAKE MY PRESUMPTION IN SUCH GOOD PART PRAY SIT DOWN SIR YOU WILL FIND THAT CHAIR A COMFORTABLE ONE PRESUMPTION ECHOED WINGFOLD THE PRESUMPTION WAS ALL ON MY PART AND
7069-246904-0004 THE KINDNESS ON YOURS BUT YOU MUST FIRST HEAR MY EXPLANATION SUCH AS IT IS IT MAKES THE MATTER HARDLY A JOT THE BETTER ONLY A MAN WOULD NOT WILLINGLY LOOK WORSE OR BETTER EITHER THAN HE IS
7069-246904-0005 NEITHER MORE NOR LESS IT IS A NOBLE WEAKNESS AND FAR ENOUGH FROM COMMON I AM SORRY TO THINK RETURNED POLWARTH THE CURATE THEN TOLD THE GATE KEEPER OF HIS UNCLE'S LEGACY
7069-246904-0006 AND HIS OWN IGNORANCE OF JEREMY TAYLOR BUT HE CONCLUDED SINCE YOU SET ME ABOUT IT MY JUDGMENT HAS CAPSIZED ITSELF
7069-246904-0007 ONLY IT BE ABOVE BOARD I BELIEVE SOME CLERGYMEN THINK THE ONLY EVIL LIES IN DETECTION I DOUBT IF THEY EVER ESCAPE IT AND BELIEVE THE AMOUNT OF SUCCESSFUL DECEPTION IN THAT KIND TO BE VERY SMALL INDEED
7069-246904-0008 BY A KIND OF INSTINCT WHETHER A MAN BE PREACHING HIS OWN SERMONS OR NOT
7069-246904-0009 IN THE TACIT UNDERSTANDING THAT A SERMON MUST SEEM TO BE A MAN'S OWN ALTHOUGH ALL IN THE CONGREGATION KNOW AND THE WOULD BE PREACHER KNOWS THAT THEY KNOW THAT IT IS NONE OF HIS THEN
7069-246904-0010 ON HIS DEATH BED EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT I SHOULD SUPPORT THEIR TEACHING BY MY EXAMPLE FOR HAVING GONE OVER THEM SOME TEN OR FIFTEEN TIMES IN THE COURSE OF HIS INCUMBENCY AND BETTERED EACH
7069-246904-0011 POLWARTH LAUGHED BUT WITH A CERTAIN SERIOUSNESS IN HIS MERRIMENT WHICH HOWEVER TOOK NOTHING FROM ITS GENUINENESS INDEED
7069-246904-0012 WINGFOLD WAS SILENT THOUGHTFUL SAYING TO HIMSELF HOW STRAIGHT AN HONEST BOW CAN SHOOT BUT THIS INVOLVES SOMETHING AWFUL
7069-246904-0013 TO STAND UP IN THAT PULPIT AND SPEAK ABOUT MYSELF I WHO EVEN IF I HAD ANY OPINIONS COULD NEVER SEE REASON FOR PRESENTING THEM TO OTHER PEOPLE IT'S MY OFFICE IS IT NOT ME
7069-246904-0014 THEN I WISH MY OFFICE WOULD WRITE HIS OWN SERMONS HE CAN READ THE PRAYERS WELL ENOUGH ALL HIS LIFE A LITTLE HEAVE OF PENT UP HUMOUR WOULD NOW AND THEN SHAKE HIS BURDEN INTO A MORE COMFORTABLE POSITION UPON HIS BENDING SHOULDERS
7069-246904-0015 WHITHER SOME OF OUR MOST NOTED PREACHERS GO TO DIG FOR THEIR FIRST INSPIRATIONS
7069-246904-0016 OWN HEART YOUR DELIGHT IN SOMETHING YOU HAD FOUND OUT OR SOMETHING YOU FELT MUCH NO ANSWERED WINGFOLD I HAVE NOTHING NEVER HAD ANYTHING
7069-246904-0017 WORTH GIVING TO ANOTHER AND IT WOULD SEEM TO ME VERY UNREASONABLE TO SUBJECT A HELPLESS CONGREGATION TO THE BLUNDERING ATTEMPTS OF SUCH A FELLOW TO PUT INTO THE FORMS OF REASONABLE SPEECH
7069-246904-0018 THEY KNOW THEM ALREADY SAID POLWARTH I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT A MAN WHO LOOKS THINGS IN THE FACE AS YOU DO THE MOMENT THEY CONFRONT YOU HAS NOT LIVED AT ALL HAS NEVER
7069-246904-0019 IN SO FAR AS THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND HAS CEASED TO BE A PREACHING CHURCH AND I DON'T CALL NINE TENTHS OF WHAT GOES BY THE NAME OF IT PREACHING SHE HAS FORGOTTEN A MIGHTY PART OF HER HIGH CALLING
7069-246904-0020 OF COURSE A MAN TO WHOM NO MESSAGE HAS BEEN PERSONALLY GIVEN HAS NO RIGHT TO TAKE THE PLACE OF A PROPHET AND CANNOT SAVE BY MORE OR LESS OF SIMULATION BUT THERE IS ROOM FOR TEACHERS
7069-246904-0021 THE MORE NEED OF TEACHERS THAT THE PROPHETS ARE SO FEW AND A MAN MAY RIGHT HONESTLY BE A CLERGYMAN WHO TEACHES THE PEOPLE THOUGH HE MAY POSSESS NONE OF THE GIFTS OF PROPHECY
7069-246904-0022 I DO NOT NOW SEE WELL HOW YOU ARE LEADING ME SAID WINGFOLD CONSIDERABLY ASTONISHED AT BOTH THE APTNESS AND FLUENCY WITH WHICH A MAN IN HIS HOST'S POSITION WAS ABLE TO EXPRESS HIMSELF PRAY
7069-246904-0023 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PROPHECY I MEAN
7069-246904-0024 LET HIM BRING SOMETHING OLD OUT OF ANOTHER MAN'S
7069-246904-0025 AND HAS NO BUSINESS IN ANY PULPIT BUT OUGHT TO BETAKE HIMSELF TO SOME OTHER EMPLOYMENT WHATEVER HE MAY HAVE BEEN PREDESTINED TO I MEAN MADE FIT FOR
7069-246904-0026 MAKE UP HIS SERMONS FROM THE BOOKS HE READS YES IF HE CANNOT DO BETTER
7069-246904-0027 NOT WITH HIS SERMON IN HIS EYE BUT WITH HIS PEOPLE IN HIS HEART MEN IN BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS HAVE SO LITTLE TIME FOR READING OR THINKING AND
7069-246904-0028 IDLE PEOPLE HAVE STILL LESS THAT THEIR MEANS OF GRACE AS THE THEOLOGIANS SAY ARE CONFINED TO DISCIPLINE WITHOUT NOURISHMENT WHENCE THEIR RELIGION IF THEY HAVE ANY
7069-246904-0029 IS OFTEN FROM MERE ATROPHY BUT A SKELETON
7069-246904-0030 WAKE THEM UP LEST THEIR SLEEP TURN TO DEATH NEXT TO MAKE THEM HUNGRY AND LASTLY TO SUPPLY THAT HUNGER AND FOR ALL THESE THINGS THE PASTOR
7069-246904-0031 AND NO SHEPHERD AT THIS MOMENT RACHEL ENTERED WITH A SMALL TEA TRAY SHE COULD CARRY ONLY LITTLE THINGS AND A FEW AT A TIME SHE CAST A GLANCE OF ALMOST LOVING SOLICITUDE AT THE YOUNG MAN
7069-246904-0032 AS IF INTERCEDING FOR A CULPRIT AND BEGGING THE MASTER NOT TO BE TOO HARD UPON HIM BUT THE LITTLE MAN SMILED SUCH A SWEET SMILE OF RE ASSURANCE THAT HER FACE
