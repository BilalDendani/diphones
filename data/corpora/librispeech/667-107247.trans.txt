667-107247-0000 THE HUSBAND IN THE COURSE OF THE MANEUVRES THE N CAVALRY REGIMENT HALTED FOR A NIGHT AT THE DISTRICT TOWN OF K SUCH AN EVENT AS THE VISIT OF OFFICERS ALWAYS HAS THE MOST EXCITING AND INSPIRING EFFECT ON THE INHABITANTS OF PROVINCIAL TOWNS
667-107247-0001 THE INNS AND RESTAURANTS KEEP OPEN ALL NIGHT THE MILITARY COMMANDANT HIS SECRETARY AND THE LOCAL GARRISON PUT ON THEIR BEST UNIFORMS THE POLICE FLIT TO AND FRO LIKE MAD WHILE THE EFFECT ON THE LADIES IS BEYOND ALL DESCRIPTION
667-107247-0002 THE LADIES OF K HEARING THE REGIMENT APPROACHING FORSOOK THEIR PANS OF BOILING JAM AND RAN INTO THE STREET FORGETTING THEIR MORNING DESHABILLE AND GENERAL UNTIDINESS THEY RUSHED BREATHLESS WITH EXCITEMENT TO MEET THE REGIMENT
667-107247-0003 AND LISTENED GREEDILY TO THE BAND PLAYING THE MARCH LOOKING AT THEIR PALE ECSTATIC FACES ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THOSE STRAINS CAME FROM SOME HEAVENLY CHOIR
667-107247-0004 THE REGIMENT THEY CRIED JOYFULLY THE REGIMENT IS COMING WHAT COULD THIS UNKNOWN REGIMENT THAT CAME BY CHANCE TO DAY AND WOULD DEPART AT DAWN TO MORROW MEAN TO THEM AFTERWARDS WHEN THE OFFICERS WERE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SQUARE
667-107247-0005 WHEN A POCK MARKED SOLDIER IN A RED SHIRT DARTED PAST THE WINDOWS THEY KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WAS LIEUTENANT RYMZOV'S ORDERLY RUNNING ABOUT THE TOWN TRYING TO GET SOME ENGLISH BITTER ALE ON TICK FOR HIS MASTER
667-107247-0006 AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THE MILITARY BAND WAS PLAYING IN THE STREET BEFORE THE CLUB WHILE IN THE CLUB ITSELF THE OFFICERS WERE DANCING WITH THE LADIES OF K THE LADIES FELT AS THOUGH THEY WERE ON WINGS
667-107247-0007 INTOXICATED BY THE DANCING THE MUSIC AND THE CLANK OF SPURS THEY THREW THEMSELVES HEART AND SOUL INTO MAKING THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THEIR NEW PARTNERS AND QUITE FORGOT THEIR OLD CIVILIAN FRIENDS
667-107247-0008 THEIR FATHERS AND HUSBANDS FORCED TEMPORARILY INTO THE BACKGROUND CROWDED ROUND THE MEAGRE REFRESHMENT TABLE IN THE ENTRANCE HALL ALL THESE GOVERNMENT CASHIERS SECRETARIES CLERKS AND SUPERINTENDENTS STALE SICKLY LOOKING CLUMSY FIGURES
667-107247-0009 A NARROW SPITEFUL SOUL GIVEN TO DRINK WITH A BIG CLOSELY CROPPED HEAD AND THICK PROTRUDING LIPS
667-107247-0010 THERE HAD BEEN A TIME WHEN HE USED TO READ PROGRESSIVE LITERATURE AND SING STUDENTS SONGS BUT NOW AS HE SAID OF HIMSELF HE WAS A TAX COLLECTOR AND NOTHING MORE HE STOOD LEANING AGAINST THE DOORPOST HIS EYES FIXED ON HIS WIFE ANNA PAVLOVNA
667-107247-0011 A LITTLE BRUNETTE OF THIRTY WITH A LONG NOSE AND A POINTED CHIN TIGHTLY LACED WITH HER FACE CAREFULLY POWDERED SHE DANCED WITHOUT PAUSING FOR BREATH DANCED TILL SHE WAS READY TO DROP EXHAUSTED BUT THOUGH SHE WAS EXHAUSTED IN BODY
667-107247-0012 AND NEVER DOUBTING THAT HER HUSBAND WAS TO BE A PRINCE OR AT THE WORST A BARON THE TAX COLLECTOR WATCHED SCOWLING WITH SPITE IT WAS NOT JEALOUSY HE WAS FEELING HE WAS ILL HUMOURED FIRST BECAUSE THE ROOM WAS TAKEN UP WITH DANCING
667-107247-0013 AND THERE WAS NOWHERE HE COULD PLAY A GAME OF CARDS SECONDLY BECAUSE HE COULD NOT ENDURE THE SOUND OF WIND INSTRUMENTS AND THIRDLY BECAUSE HE FANCIED THE OFFICERS TREATED THE CIVILIANS SOMEWHAT TOO CASUALLY AND DISDAINFULLY
667-107247-0014 BUT WHAT ABOVE EVERYTHING REVOLTED HIM AND MOVED HIM TO INDIGNATION WAS THE EXPRESSION OF HAPPINESS ON HIS WIFE'S FACE IT MAKES ME SICK TO LOOK AT HER HE MUTTERED GOING ON FOR FORTY AND NOTHING TO BOAST OF AT ANY TIME
667-107247-0015 AND SHE MUST POWDER HER FACE AND LACE HERSELF UP AND FRIZZING HER HAIR FLIRTING AND MAKING FACES AND FANCYING SHE'S DOING THE THING IN STYLE
667-107247-0016 YOU'RE A PRETTY FIGURE UPON MY SOUL
667-107247-0017 OF COURSE NOT WHERE DO WE POOR COUNTRY BUMPKINS COME IN SNEERED THE TAX COLLECTOR WE ARE AT A DISCOUNT NOW WE'RE CLUMSY SEALS UNPOLISHED PROVINCIAL BEARS AND SHE'S THE QUEEN OF THE BALL
667-107247-0018 THEY'D NOT OBJECT TO MAKING LOVE TO HER I DARE SAY DURING THE MAZURKA THE TAX COLLECTOR'S FACE TWITCHED WITH SPITE A BLACK HAIRED OFFICER WITH PROMINENT EYES AND TARTAR CHEEKBONES DANCED THE MAZURKA WITH ANNA PAVLOVNA
667-107247-0019 ASSUMING A STERN EXPRESSION HE WORKED HIS LEGS WITH GRAVITY AND FEELING AND SO CROOKED HIS KNEES THAT HE LOOKED LIKE A JACK A DANDY PULLED BY STRINGS WHILE ANNA PAVLOVNA PALE AND THRILLED BENDING HER FIGURE LANGUIDLY AND TURNING HER EYES UP
667-107247-0020 TRIED TO LOOK AS THOUGH SHE SCARCELY TOUCHED THE FLOOR AND EVIDENTLY FELT HERSELF THAT SHE WAS NOT ON EARTH NOT AT THE LOCAL CLUB BUT SOMEWHERE FAR FAR AWAY IN THE CLOUDS
667-107247-0021 NOT ONLY HER FACE BUT HER WHOLE FIGURE WAS EXPRESSIVE OF BEATITUDE THE TAX COLLECTOR COULD ENDURE IT NO LONGER HE FELT A DESIRE TO JEER AT THAT BEATITUDE TO MAKE ANNA PAVLOVNA FEEL THAT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HERSELF
667-107247-0022 THAT LIFE WAS BY NO MEANS SO DELIGHTFUL AS SHE FANCIED NOW IN HER EXCITEMENT YOU WAIT I'LL TEACH YOU TO SMILE SO BLISSFULLY HE MUTTERED YOU ARE NOT A BOARDING SCHOOL MISS YOU ARE NOT A GIRL AN OLD FRIGHT OUGHT TO REALISE SHE IS A FRIGHT
667-107247-0023 PETTY FEELINGS OF ENVY VEXATION WOUNDED VANITY OF THAT SMALL PROVINCIAL MISANTHROPY ENGENDERED IN PETTY OFFICIALS BY VODKA AND A SEDENTARY LIFE SWARMED IN HIS HEART LIKE MICE WAITING FOR THE END OF THE MAZURKA
667-107247-0024 HE WENT INTO THE HALL AND WALKED UP TO HIS WIFE ANNA PAVLOVNA WAS SITTING WITH HER PARTNER AND FLIRTING HER FAN AND COQUETTISHLY DROPPING HER EYELIDS WAS DESCRIBING HOW SHE USED TO DANCE IN PETERSBURG HER LIPS WERE PURSED UP LIKE A ROSEBUD AND SHE PRONOUNCED
667-107247-0025 SHE FELT ASHAMED THAT SHE HAD SUCH A SICKLY LOOKING ILL HUMOURED ORDINARY HUSBAND LET US GO HOME REPEATED THE TAX COLLECTOR WHY IT'S QUITE EARLY I BEG YOU TO COME HOME SAID THE TAX COLLECTOR DELIBERATELY
667-107247-0026 WITH A SPITEFUL EXPRESSION WHY HAS ANYTHING HAPPENED ANNA PAVLOVNA ASKED IN A FLUTTER NOTHING HAS HAPPENED BUT I WISH YOU TO GO HOME AT ONCE I WISH IT THAT'S ENOUGH AND WITHOUT FURTHER TALK PLEASE
667-107247-0027 WHY GO HOME WHY IT'S NOT ELEVEN O'CLOCK I WISH IT AND THAT'S ENOUGH COME ALONG AND THAT'S ALL ABOUT IT DON'T BE SILLY GO HOME ALONE IF YOU WANT TO ALL RIGHT THEN I SHALL MAKE A SCENE
667-107247-0028 THE TAX COLLECTOR SAW THE LOOK OF BEATITUDE GRADUALLY VANISH FROM HIS WIFE'S FACE SAW HOW ASHAMED AND MISERABLE SHE WAS AND HE FELT A LITTLE HAPPIER WHY DO YOU WANT ME AT ONCE ASKED HIS WIFE I DON'T WANT YOU
667-107247-0029 PALE BITING HER LIPS AND ALMOST CRYING SHE WENT OUT TO THE ENTRY AND BEGAN PUTTING ON HER THINGS YOU ARE NOT GOING
667-107247-0030 HER HEAD ACHES SAID THE TAX COLLECTOR FOR HIS WIFE COMING OUT OF THE CLUB THE HUSBAND AND WIFE WALKED ALL THE WAY HOME IN SILENCE THE TAX COLLECTOR WALKED BEHIND HIS WIFE AND WATCHING HER DOWNCAST SORROWFUL HUMILIATED LITTLE FIGURE
667-107247-0031 HE RECALLED THE LOOK OF BEATITUDE WHICH HAD SO IRRITATED HIM AT THE CLUB AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE BEATITUDE WAS GONE FILLED HIS SOUL WITH TRIUMPH HE WAS PLEASED AND SATISFIED AND AT THE SAME TIME HE FELT THE LACK OF SOMETHING
667-107247-0032 SO THAT ALL MIGHT KNOW HOW STALE AND WORTHLESS LIFE IS WHEN YOU WALK ALONG THE STREETS IN THE DARK AND HEAR THE SLUSH OF THE MUD UNDER YOUR FEET AND WHEN YOU KNOW THAT YOU WILL WAKE UP NEXT MORNING WITH NOTHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO BUT VODKA AND CARDS OH HOW AWFUL IT IS
667-107247-0033 AND ANNA PAVLOVNA COULD SCARCELY WALK SHE WAS STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DANCING THE MUSIC THE TALK THE LIGHTS AND THE NOISE SHE ASKED HERSELF AS SHE WALKED ALONG WHY GOD HAD THUS AFFLICTED HER
667-107247-0034 SHE FELT MISERABLE INSULTED AND CHOKING WITH HATE AS SHE LISTENED TO HER HUSBAND'S HEAVY FOOTSTEPS SHE WAS SILENT TRYING TO THINK OF THE MOST OFFENSIVE BITING AND VENOMOUS WORD SHE COULD HURL AT HER HUSBAND
667-107247-0035 AND AT THE SAME TIME SHE WAS FULLY AWARE THAT NO WORD COULD PENETRATE HER TAX COLLECTOR'S HIDE WHAT DID HE CARE FOR WORDS HER BITTEREST ENEMY COULD NOT HAVE CONTRIVED FOR HER A MORE HELPLESS POSITION
