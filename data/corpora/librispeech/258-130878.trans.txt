258-130878-0000 THE CORAL REALM THE NEXT DAY I WOKE UP WITH MY HEAD UNUSUALLY CLEAR MUCH TO MY SURPRISE I WAS IN MY STATEROOM
258-130878-0001 NO DOUBT MY COMPANIONS HAD BEEN PUT BACK IN THEIR CABIN WITHOUT NOTICING IT ANY MORE THAN I HAD LIKE ME THEY WOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TOOK PLACE DURING THE NIGHT AND TO UNRAVEL THIS MYSTERY
258-130878-0002 I THEN CONSIDERED LEAVING MY STATEROOM WAS I FREE OR STILL A PRISONER PERFECTLY FREE I OPENED MY DOOR HEADED DOWN THE GANGWAYS AND CLIMBED THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY
258-130878-0003 HATCHES THAT HAD BEEN CLOSED THE DAY BEFORE WERE NOW OPEN I ARRIVED ON THE PLATFORM NED LAND AND CONSEIL WERE THERE WAITING FOR ME I QUESTIONED THEM THEY KNEW NOTHING LOST IN A HEAVY SLEEP OF WHICH THEY HAD NO MEMORY
258-130878-0004 THEY WERE QUITE STARTLED TO BE BACK IN THEIR CABIN AS FOR THE NAUTILUS IT SEEMED AS TRANQUIL AND MYSTERIOUS AS EVER IT WAS CRUISING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES AT A MODERATE SPEED NOTHING SEEMED TO HAVE CHANGED ON BOARD
258-130878-0005 NED LAND OBSERVED THE SEA WITH HIS PENETRATING EYES IT WAS DESERTED THE CANADIAN SIGHTED NOTHING NEW ON THE HORIZON NEITHER SAIL NOR SHORE A BREEZE WAS BLOWING NOISILY FROM THE WEST
258-130878-0006 AND DISHEVELED BY THE WIND LONG BILLOWS MADE THE SUBMERSIBLE ROLL VERY NOTICEABLY AFTER RENEWING ITS AIR THE NAUTILUS STAYED AT AN AVERAGE DEPTH OF FIFTEEN METERS ENABLING IT TO RETURN QUICKLY TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
258-130878-0007 AND CONTRARY TO CUSTOM IT EXECUTED SUCH A MANEUVER SEVERAL TIMES DURING THAT DAY OF JANUARY NINETEENTH THE CHIEF OFFICER WOULD THEN CLIMB ONTO THE PLATFORM AND HIS USUAL PHRASE WOULD RING THROUGH THE SHIP'S INTERIOR
258-130878-0008 WHO SERVED ME WITH HIS USUAL MUTE EFFICIENCY NEAR TWO O'CLOCK I WAS BUSY ORGANIZING MY NOTES IN THE LOUNGE WHEN THE CAPTAIN OPENED THE DOOR AND APPEARED I BOWED TO HIM HE GAVE ME AN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE BOW IN RETURN WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO ME
258-130878-0009 I RESUMED MY WORK HOPING HE MIGHT GIVE ME SOME EXPLANATION OF THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON'S EVENTS HE DID NOTHING OF THE SORT I STARED AT HIM HIS FACE LOOKED EXHAUSTED HIS REDDENED EYES HADN'T BEEN REFRESHED BY SLEEP
258-130878-0010 HIS FACIAL FEATURES EXPRESSED PROFOUND SADNESS REAL CHAGRIN HE WALKED UP AND DOWN SAT AND STOOD PICKED UP A BOOK AT RANDOM DISCARDED IT IMMEDIATELY CONSULTED HIS INSTRUMENTS WITHOUT TAKING HIS CUSTOMARY NOTES
258-130878-0011 AND SEEMED UNABLE TO REST EASY FOR AN INSTANT FINALLY HE CAME OVER TO ME AND SAID ARE YOU A PHYSICIAN PROFESSOR ARONNAX THIS INQUIRY WAS SO UNEXPECTED THAT I STARED AT HIM A GOOD WHILE WITHOUT REPLYING
258-130878-0012 SEVERAL OF YOUR SCIENTIFIC COLLEAGUES TOOK THEIR DEGREES IN MEDICINE
258-130878-0013 MOQUIN TANDON AND OTHERS THAT'S RIGHT I SAID I AM A DOCTOR I USED TO BE ON CALL AT THE HOSPITALS I WAS IN PRACTICE FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE JOINING THE MUSEUM EXCELLENT SIR
258-130878-0014 MY REPLY OBVIOUSLY PLEASED CAPTAIN NEMO BUT NOT KNOWING WHAT HE WAS DRIVING AT I WAITED FOR FURTHER QUESTIONS
258-130878-0015 PROFESSOR ARONNAX THE CAPTAIN SAID TO ME WOULD YOU CONSENT TO GIVE YOUR MEDICAL ATTENTIONS TO ONE OF MY MEN SOMEONE IS SICK YES I'M READY TO GO WITH YOU COME
258-130878-0016 I ADMIT THAT MY HEART WAS POUNDING LORD KNOWS WHY BUT I SAW A DEFINITE CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS SICK CREWMAN AND YESTERDAY'S HAPPENINGS
258-130878-0017 CAPTAIN NEMO LED ME TO THE NAUTILUS'S STERN AND INVITED ME INTO A CABIN LOCATED NEXT TO THE SAILORS QUARTERS ON A BED THERE LAY A MAN SOME FORTY YEARS OLD WITH STRONGLY MOLDED FEATURES THE VERY IMAGE OF AN ANGLO SAXON
258-130878-0018 I BENT OVER HIM NOT ONLY WAS HE SICK HE WAS WOUNDED SWATHED IN BLOOD SOAKED LINEN HIS HEAD WAS RESTING ON A FOLDED PILLOW I UNDID THE LINEN BANDAGES WHILE THE WOUNDED MAN GAZED WITH GREAT STARING EYES
258-130878-0019 AND LET ME PROCEED WITHOUT MAKING A SINGLE COMPLAINT IT WAS A HORRIBLE WOUND THE CRANIUM HAD BEEN SMASHED OPEN BY SOME BLUNT INSTRUMENT LEAVING THE NAKED BRAINS EXPOSED AND THE CEREBRAL MATTER HAD SUFFERED DEEP ABRASIONS
258-130878-0020 BLOOD CLOTS HAD FORMED IN THIS DISSOLVING MASS TAKING ON THE COLOR OF WINE DREGS BOTH CONTUSION AND CONCUSSION OF THE BRAIN HAD OCCURRED THE SICK MAN'S BREATHING WAS LABORED AND MUSCLE SPASMS QUIVERED IN HIS FACE
258-130878-0021 CEREBRAL INFLAMMATION WAS COMPLETE AND HAD BROUGHT ON A PARALYSIS OF MOVEMENT AND SENSATION I TOOK THE WOUNDED MAN'S PULSE IT WAS INTERMITTENT
258-130878-0022 AFTER DRESSING THE POOR MAN'S WOUND I REDID THE LINEN BANDAGES AROUND HIS HEAD AND I TURNED TO CAPTAIN NEMO HOW DID HE GET THIS WOUND I ASKED HIM THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT THE CAPTAIN REPLIED EVASIVELY
258-130878-0023 THE NAUTILUS SUFFERED A COLLISION THAT CRACKED ONE OF THE ENGINE LEVERS AND IT STRUCK THIS MAN MY CHIEF OFFICER WAS STANDING BESIDE HIM THIS MAN LEAPED FORWARD TO INTERCEPT THE BLOW A BROTHER LAYS DOWN HIS LIFE FOR HIS BROTHER A FRIEND FOR HIS FRIEND
258-130878-0024 WHAT COULD BE SIMPLER THAT'S THE LAW FOR EVERYONE ON BOARD THE NAUTILUS BUT WHAT'S YOUR DIAGNOSIS OF HIS CONDITION I HESITATED TO SPEAK MY MIND YOU MAY TALK FREELY THE CAPTAIN TOLD ME THIS MAN DOESN'T UNDERSTAND FRENCH
258-130878-0025 I TOOK A LAST LOOK AT THE WOUNDED MAN THEN I REPLIED THIS MAN WILL BE DEAD IN TWO HOURS NOTHING CAN SAVE HIM NOTHING
258-130878-0026 AND TEARS SLID FROM HIS EYES WHICH I HAD THOUGHT INCAPABLE OF WEEPING FOR A FEW MOMENTS MORE I OBSERVED THE DYING MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS EBBING LITTLE BY LITTLE HE GREW STILL MORE PALE UNDER THE ELECTRIC LIGHT THAT BATHED HIS DEATHBED
258-130878-0027 I LOOKED AT HIS INTELLIGENT HEAD FURROWED WITH PREMATURE WRINKLES THAT MISFORTUNE PERHAPS MISERY HAD ETCHED LONG BEFORE I WAS HOPING TO DETECT THE SECRET OF HIS LIFE IN THE LAST WORDS THAT MIGHT ESCAPE FROM HIS LIPS
258-130878-0028 YOU MAY GO PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME
258-130878-0029 VERY MOVED BY THIS SCENE ALL DAY LONG I WAS AQUIVER WITH GRUESOME FOREBODINGS THAT NIGHT I SLEPT POORLY AND BETWEEN MY FITFUL DREAMS I THOUGHT I HEARD A DISTANT MOANING LIKE A FUNERAL DIRGE WAS IT A PRAYER FOR THE DEAD
258-130878-0030 MURMURED IN THAT LANGUAGE I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE NEXT MORNING I CLIMBED ON DECK CAPTAIN NEMO WAS ALREADY THERE AS SOON AS HE SAW ME HE CAME OVER PROFESSOR HE SAID TO ME
258-130878-0031 WOULD IT BE CONVENIENT FOR YOU TO MAKE AN UNDERWATER EXCURSION TODAY WITH MY COMPANIONS I ASKED IF THEY'RE AGREEABLE WE'RE YOURS TO COMMAND CAPTAIN THEN KINDLY PUT ON YOUR DIVING SUITS AS FOR THE DEAD OR DYING MAN
258-130878-0032 HE HADN'T COME INTO THE PICTURE I REJOINED NED LAND AND CONSEIL I INFORMED THEM OF CAPTAIN NEMO'S PROPOSITION CONSEIL WAS EAGER TO ACCEPT AND THIS TIME THE CANADIAN PROVED PERFECTLY AMENABLE TO GOING WITH US IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
258-130878-0033 BY EIGHT THIRTY WE WERE SUITED UP FOR THIS NEW STROLL AND EQUIPPED WITH OUR TWO DEVICES FOR LIGHTING AND BREATHING THE DOUBLE DOOR OPENED
258-130878-0034 WE SET FOOT ON THE FIRM SEAFLOOR WHERE THE NAUTILUS WAS RESTING TEN METERS DOWN A GENTLE SLOPE GRAVITATED TO AN UNEVEN BOTTOM WHOSE DEPTH WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN FATHOMS
258-130878-0035 THIS BOTTOM WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE I HAD VISITED DURING MY FIRST EXCURSION UNDER THE WATERS OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN HERE I SAW NO FINE GRAINED SAND NO UNDERWATER PRAIRIES NOT ONE OPEN SEA FOREST
258-130878-0036 I IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THE WONDROUS REGION IN WHICH CAPTAIN NEMO DID THE HONORS THAT DAY IT WAS THE CORAL REALM IN THE ZOOPHYTE BRANCH CLASS ALCYONARIA ONE FINDS THE ORDER GORGONARIA WHICH CONTAINS THREE GROUPS SEA FANS
258-130878-0037 ISIDIAN POLYPS AND CORAL POLYPS IT'S IN THIS LAST THAT PRECIOUS CORAL BELONGS AN UNUSUAL SUBSTANCE THAT AT DIFFERENT TIMES HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED IN THE MINERAL VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS MEDICINE TO THE ANCIENTS
258-130878-0038 JEWELRY TO THE MODERNS IT WASN'T DECISIVELY PLACED IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM UNTIL SIXTEEN NINETY FOUR BY PEYSONNEL OF MARSEILLES
258-130878-0039 THESE POLYPS HAVE A UNIQUE GENERATING MECHANISM THAT REPRODUCES THEM VIA THE BUDDING PROCESS AND THEY HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL EXISTENCE WHILE ALSO PARTICIPATING IN A COMMUNAL LIFE HENCE THEY EMBODY A SORT OF NATURAL SOCIALISM
258-130878-0040 I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE LATEST RESEARCH ON THIS BIZARRE ZOOPHYTE WHICH TURNS TO STONE WHILE TAKING ON A TREE FORM AS SOME NATURALISTS HAVE VERY APTLY OBSERVED
258-130878-0041 THAN TO VISIT ONE OF THESE PETRIFIED FORESTS THAT NATURE HAS PLANTED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA WE TURNED ON OUR RUHMKORFF DEVICES AND WENT ALONG A CORAL SHOAL IN THE PROCESS OF FORMING WHICH GIVEN TIME WILL SOMEDAY CLOSE OFF THIS WHOLE PART OF THE INDIAN OCEAN
258-130878-0042 OUR PATH WAS BORDERED BY HOPELESSLY TANGLED BUSHES FORMED FROM SNARLS OF SHRUBS ALL COVERED WITH LITTLE STAR SHAPED WHITE STREAKED FLOWERS ONLY CONTRARY TO PLANTS ON SHORE THESE TREE FORMS BECOME ATTACHED TO ROCKS ON THE SEAFLOOR BY HEADING FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
258-130878-0043 OUR LIGHTS PRODUCED A THOUSAND DELIGHTFUL EFFECTS WHILE PLAYING OVER THESE BRIGHTLY COLORED BOUGHS I FANCIED I SAW THESE CYLINDRICAL MEMBRANE FILLED TUBES TREMBLING BENEATH THE WATER'S UNDULATIONS I WAS TEMPTED TO GATHER THEIR FRESH PETALS
258-130878-0044 WHICH WERE ADORNED WITH DELICATE TENTACLES SOME NEWLY IN BLOOM OTHERS BARELY OPENED WHILE NIMBLE FISH WITH FLUTTERING FINS BRUSHED PAST THEM LIKE FLOCKS OF BIRDS BUT IF MY HANDS CAME NEAR THE MOVING FLOWERS OF THESE SENSITIVE LIVELY CREATURES
258-130878-0045 AN ALARM WOULD INSTANTLY SOUND THROUGHOUT THE COLONY THE WHITE PETALS RETRACTED INTO THEIR RED SHEATHS THE FLOWERS VANISHED BEFORE MY EYES AND THE BUSH CHANGED INTO A CHUNK OF STONY NIPPLES
258-130878-0046 SHEER CHANCE HAD PLACED ME IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MOST VALUABLE SPECIMENS OF THIS ZOOPHYTE THIS CORAL WAS THE EQUAL OF THOSE FISHED UP FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN OFF THE BARBARY COAST OR THE SHORES OF FRANCE AND ITALY
258-130878-0047 WITH ITS BRIGHT COLORS IT LIVED UP TO THOSE POETIC NAMES OF BLOOD FLOWER AND BLOOD FOAM THAT THE INDUSTRY CONFERS ON ITS FINEST EXHIBITS CORAL SELLS FOR AS MUCH AS FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS PER KILOGRAM AND IN THIS LOCALITY
258-130878-0048 THE LIQUID STRATA HID ENOUGH TO MAKE THE FORTUNES OF A WHOLE HOST OF CORAL FISHERMEN THIS VALUABLE SUBSTANCE OFTEN MERGES WITH OTHER POLYPARIES FORMING COMPACT HOPELESSLY TANGLED UNITS KNOWN AS MACCIOTA
258-130878-0049 AND I NOTED SOME WONDERFUL PINK SAMPLES OF THIS CORAL BUT AS THE BUSHES SHRANK THE TREE FORMS MAGNIFIED
258-130878-0050 THE LIGHT FROM OUR GLASS COILS PRODUCED MAGICAL EFFECTS AT TIMES LINGERING ON THE WRINKLED ROUGHNESS OF SOME NATURAL ARCH OR SOME OVERHANG SUSPENDED LIKE A CHANDELIER WHICH OUR LAMPS FLECKED WITH FIERY SPARKS
258-130878-0051 AMID THESE SHRUBS OF PRECIOUS CORAL I OBSERVED OTHER POLYPS NO LESS UNUSUAL MELITA CORAL RAINBOW CORAL WITH JOINTED OUTGROWTHS THEN A FEW TUFTS OF GENUS CORALLINA SOME GREEN AND OTHERS RED
258-130878-0052 ACTUALLY A TYPE OF SEAWEED ENCRUSTED WITH LIMESTONE SALTS WHICH AFTER LONG DISPUTES NATURALISTS HAVE FINALLY PLACED IN THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM BUT AS ONE INTELLECTUAL HAS REMARKED HERE PERHAPS IS THE ACTUAL POINT
258-130878-0053 WHERE LIFE RISES HUMBLY OUT OF SLUMBERING STONE BUT WITHOUT BREAKING AWAY FROM ITS CRUDE STARTING POINT FINALLY AFTER TWO HOURS OF WALKING WE REACHED A DEPTH OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED METERS IN OTHER WORDS
258-130878-0054 BUT HERE IT WAS NO LONGER SOME ISOLATED BUSH OR A MODEST GROVE OF LOW TIMBER IT WAS AN IMMENSE FOREST HUGE MINERAL VEGETATION ENORMOUS PETRIFIED TREES LINKED BY GARLANDS OF ELEGANT HYDRAS FROM THE GENUS PLUMULARIA
258-130878-0055 THOSE TROPICAL CREEPERS OF THE SEA ALL DECKED OUT IN SHADES AND GLEAMS WE PASSED FREELY UNDER THEIR LOFTY BOUGHS LOST UP IN THE SHADOWS OF THE WAVES WHILE AT OUR FEET ORGAN PIPE CORAL STONY CORAL STAR CORAL FUNGUS CORAL
258-130878-0056 AND SEA ANEMONE FROM THE GENUS CARYOPHYLIA FORMED A CARPET OF FLOWERS ALL STREWN WITH DAZZLING GEMS WHAT AN INDESCRIBABLE SIGHT OH IF ONLY WE COULD SHARE OUR FEELINGS
258-130878-0057 WHY WERE WE IMPRISONED BEHIND THESE MASKS OF METAL AND GLASS WHY WERE WE FORBIDDEN TO TALK WITH EACH OTHER AT LEAST LET US LEAD THE LIVES OF THE FISH THAT POPULATE THIS LIQUID ELEMENT OR BETTER YET THE LIVES OF AMPHIBIANS
258-130878-0058 WHICH CAN SPEND LONG HOURS EITHER AT SEA OR ON SHORE TRAVELING THROUGH THEIR DOUBLE DOMAIN AS THEIR WHIMS DICTATE MEANWHILE CAPTAIN NEMO HAD CALLED A HALT MY COMPANIONS AND I STOPPED WALKING
258-130878-0059 AND TURNING AROUND I SAW THE CREWMEN FORM A SEMICIRCLE AROUND THEIR LEADER LOOKING WITH GREATER CARE I OBSERVED THAT FOUR OF THEM WERE CARRYING ON THEIR SHOULDERS AN OBJECT THAT WAS OBLONG IN SHAPE
258-130878-0060 AT THIS LOCALITY WE STOOD IN THE CENTER OF A HUGE CLEARING SURROUNDED BY THE TALL TREE FORMS OF THIS UNDERWATER FOREST OUR LAMPS CAST A SORT OF BRILLIANT TWILIGHT OVER THE AREA MAKING INORDINATELY LONG SHADOWS ON THE SEAFLOOR
258-130878-0061 PAST THE BOUNDARIES OF THE CLEARING THE DARKNESS DEEPENED AGAIN RELIEVED ONLY BY LITTLE SPARKLES GIVEN OFF BY THE SHARP CRESTS OF CORAL NED LAND AND CONSEIL STOOD NEXT TO ME
258-130878-0062 WE STARED AND IT DAWNED ON ME THAT I WAS ABOUT TO WITNESS A STRANGE SCENE OBSERVING THE SEAFLOOR I SAW THAT IT SWELLED AT CERTAIN POINTS FROM LOW BULGES THAT WERE ENCRUSTED WITH LIMESTONE DEPOSITS
258-130878-0063 AND ARRANGED WITH A SYMMETRY THAT BETRAYED THE HAND OF MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CLEARING ON A PEDESTAL OF ROUGHLY PILED ROCKS THERE STOOD A CROSS OF CORAL EXTENDING LONG ARMS YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WERE MADE OF PETRIFIED BLOOD
258-130878-0064 ONE OF HIS MEN STEPPED FORWARD AND A FEW FEET FROM THIS CROSS DETACHED A MATTOCK FROM HIS BELT AND BEGAN TO DIG A HOLE I FINALLY UNDERSTOOD THIS CLEARING WAS A CEMETERY THIS HOLE A GRAVE
258-130878-0065 THAT OBLONG OBJECT THE BODY OF THE MAN WHO MUST HAVE DIED DURING THE NIGHT
258-130878-0066 NO MY MIND WAS REELING AS NEVER BEFORE NEVER HAD IDEAS OF SUCH IMPACT RACED THROUGH MY BRAIN I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE WHAT MY EYES SAW MEANWHILE THE GRAVE DIGGING WENT SLOWLY
258-130878-0067 FISH FLED HERE AND THERE AS THEIR RETREAT WAS DISTURBED I HEARD THE PICK RINGING ON THE LIMESTONE SOIL ITS IRON TIP SOMETIMES GIVING OFF SPARKS WHEN IT HIT A STRAY PIECE OF FLINT ON THE SEA BOTTOM THE HOLE GREW LONGER WIDER AND SOON
258-130878-0068 WAS DEEP ENOUGH TO RECEIVE THE BODY THEN THE PALLBEARERS APPROACHED WRAPPED IN WHITE FABRIC MADE FROM FILAMENTS OF THE FAN MUSSEL THE BODY WAS LOWERED INTO ITS WATERY GRAVE
258-130878-0069 CAPTAIN NEMO ARMS CROSSED OVER HIS CHEST KNELT IN A POSTURE OF PRAYER AS DID ALL THE FRIENDS OF HIM WHO HAD LOVED THEM MY TWO COMPANIONS AND I BOWED REVERENTLY
258-130878-0070 THE GRAVE WAS THEN COVERED OVER WITH THE RUBBLE DUG FROM THE SEAFLOOR AND IT FORMED A LOW MOUND WHEN THIS WAS DONE
258-130878-0071 THEN THEY ALL APPROACHED THE GRAVE SANK AGAIN ON BENDED KNEE AND EXTENDED THEIR HANDS IN A SIGN OF FINAL FAREWELL THEN THE FUNERAL PARTY WENT BACK UP THE PATH TO THE NAUTILUS RETURNING BENEATH THE ARCHES OF THE FOREST
258-130878-0072 THROUGH THE THICKETS ALONG THE CORAL BUSHES GOING STEADILY HIGHER FINALLY THE SHIP'S RAYS APPEARED THEIR LUMINOUS TRAIL GUIDED US TO THE NAUTILUS BY ONE O'CLOCK WE HAD RETURNED
258-130878-0073 AFTER CHANGING CLOTHES I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM AND IN THE GRIP OF DREADFULLY OBSESSIVE THOUGHTS I SAT NEXT TO THE BEACON
258-130878-0074 I STOOD UP AND SAID TO HIM SO AS I PREDICTED THAT MAN DIED DURING THE NIGHT YES PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED AND NOW HE RESTS BESIDE HIS COMPANIONS IN THAT CORAL CEMETERY YES
258-130878-0075 FORGOTTEN BY THE WORLD BUT NOT BY US WE DIG THE GRAVES THEN ENTRUST THE POLYPS WITH SEALING AWAY OUR DEAD FOR ETERNITY AND WITH A SUDDEN GESTURE THE CAPTAIN HID HIS FACE IN HIS CLENCHED FISTS VAINLY TRYING TO HOLD BACK A SOB
258-130878-0076 THEN HE ADDED THERE LIES OUR PEACEFUL CEMETERY HUNDREDS OF FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES AT LEAST CAPTAIN YOUR DEAD CAN SLEEP SERENELY THERE OUT OF THE REACH OF SHARKS
