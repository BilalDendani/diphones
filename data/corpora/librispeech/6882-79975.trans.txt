6882-79975-0031 SHE THOUGHT WITH A HEAVY HEART OF HER SAD FATE SHE CURSED THE PRIDE AND HAUGHTINESS WHICH HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF HER HUMILIATION AND OF HER BEING BROUGHT TO SUCH DEPTHS
6882-79975-0032 EVERY NOW AND THEN THE SERVANTS WOULD THROW HER BITS FROM THE SAVOURY DISHES THEY WERE CARRYING AWAY FROM THE FEAST AND THESE SHE PUT INTO HER POTS TO TAKE HOME WITH HER ALL AT ONCE THE KING'S SON CAME IN HE WAS DRESSED IN SILK AND VELVET
6882-79975-0033 AND HE HAD A GOLDEN CHAIN ROUND HIS NECK WHEN HE SAW THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN STANDING AT THE DOOR HE SEIZED HER BY THE HAND AND WANTED TO DANCE WITH HER BUT SHE SHRANK AND REFUSED BECAUSE SHE SAW THAT IT WAS KING THRUSHBEARD
6882-79975-0034 WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE SUITORS FOR HER HAND AND WHOM SHE HAD MOST SCORNFULLY DRIVEN AWAY HER RESISTANCE WAS NO USE AND HE DRAGGED HER INTO THE HALL THE STRING BY WHICH HER POCKETS WERE SUSPENDED BROKE
6882-79975-0035 DOWN FELL THE POTS AND THE SOUP AND SAVOURY MORSELS WERE SPILT ALL OVER THE FLOOR WHEN THE GUESTS SAW IT THEY BURST INTO SHOUTS OF MOCKING LAUGHTER
6882-79975-0036 SHE RUSHED TO THE DOOR AND TRIED TO ESCAPE BUT ON THE STAIRS A MAN STOPPED HER AND BROUGHT HER BACK WHEN SHE LOOKED AT HIM IT WAS NO OTHER THAN KING THRUSHBEARD AGAIN HE SPOKE KINDLY TO HER AND SAID
6882-79975-0037 DO NOT BE AFRAID I AND THE BEGGAR MAN WHO LIVED IN THE POOR LITTLE HOVEL WITH YOU
6882-79975-0038 SHE WEPT BITTERLY AND SAID I WAS VERY WICKED AND I AM NOT WORTHY TO BE YOUR WIFE BUT HE SAID BE HAPPY THOSE EVIL DAYS ARE OVER NOW WE WILL CELEBRATE OUR TRUE WEDDING
6882-79975-0039 THE WAITING WOMEN CAME AND PUT RICH CLOTHING UPON HER AND HER FATHER WITH ALL HIS COURT CAME AND WISHED HER JOY ON HER MARRIAGE WITH KING THRUSHBEARD THEN IN TRUTH HER HAPPINESS BEGAN
