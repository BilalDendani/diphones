4335-15081-0000 STOOD IN THE DILEMMA OF A DEADLY PERIL AND AN ASSURED DEATH THEY CHOSE THE FORMER AND EARLY IN MARCH BEGAN TO LEAVE THEIR ISLAND AND CROSS TO THE MAIN LAND TO GATHER WHAT SUSTENANCE THEY COULD THE ICE WAS STILL THICK
4335-15081-0001 BUT THE ADVANCING SEASON HAD SOFTENED IT AND AS A BODY OF THEM WERE CROSSING IT BROKE UNDER THEIR FEET SOME WERE DROWNED WHILE OTHERS DRAGGED THEMSELVES OUT DRENCHED AND PIERCED WITH COLD TO DIE MISERABLY ON THE FROZEN LAKE BEFORE THEY COULD REACH A SHELTER
4335-15081-0002 OTHER PARTIES MORE FORTUNATE GAINED THE SHORE SAFELY AND BEGAN THEIR FISHING
4335-15081-0003 BUT THE IROQUOIS WERE IN WAIT FOR THEM A LARGE BAND OF WARRIORS HAD ALREADY MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH ICE AND SNOW FROM THEIR TOWNS IN CENTRAL NEW YORK THEY SURPRISED THE HURON FISHERMEN SURROUNDED THEM
4335-15081-0004 HAS NO INK BLACK ENOUGH TO DESCRIBE THE FURY OF THE IROQUOIS
4335-15081-0005 STILL THE GOADINGS OF FAMINE WERE RELENTLESS AND IRRESISTIBLE
4335-15081-0006 ADDS THE FATHER SUPERIOR THAT HUNGER WILL DRIVE WOLVES FROM THE FOREST SO TOO OUR STARVING HURONS WERE DRIVEN OUT OF A TOWN WHICH HAD BECOME AN ABODE OF HORROR IT WAS THE END OF LENT
4335-15081-0007 ALAS IF THESE POOR CHRISTIANS COULD HAVE HAD BUT ACORNS AND WATER TO KEEP THEIR FAST UPON ON EASTER DAY WE CAUSED THEM TO MAKE A GENERAL CONFESSION ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THEY WENT AWAY LEAVING US ALL THEIR LITTLE POSSESSIONS AND MOST OF THEM DECLARED PUBLICLY
4335-15081-0008 THAT THEY MADE US THEIR HEIRS KNOWING WELL THAT THEY WERE NEAR THEIR END AND IN FACT ONLY A FEW DAYS PASSED BEFORE WE HEARD OF THE DISASTER WHICH WE HAD FORESEEN THESE POOR PEOPLE FELL INTO AMBUSCADES OF OUR IROQUOIS ENEMIES
4335-15081-0009 SOME WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT SOME WERE DRAGGED INTO CAPTIVITY WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE BURNED A FEW MADE THEIR ESCAPE AND SPREAD DISMAY AND PANIC EVERYWHERE A WEEK AFTER ANOTHER BAND WAS OVERTAKEN BY THE SAME FATE
4335-15081-0010 TWO OF THE PRINCIPAL HURON CHIEFS CAME TO THE FORT AND ASKED AN INTERVIEW WITH RAGUENEAU AND HIS COMPANIONS THEY TOLD THEM THAT THE INDIANS HAD HELD A COUNCIL THE NIGHT BEFORE AND RESOLVED TO ABANDON THE ISLAND
4335-15081-0011 SOME WOULD DISPERSE IN THE MOST REMOTE AND INACCESSIBLE FORESTS OTHERS WOULD TAKE REFUGE IN A DISTANT SPOT APPARENTLY THE GRAND MANITOULIN ISLAND
4335-15081-0012 YOU CAN SAVE US IF YOU WILL BUT RESOLVE ON A BOLD STEP CHOOSE A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN GATHER US TOGETHER AND PREVENT THIS DISPERSION OF OUR PEOPLE TURN YOUR EYES TOWARDS QUEBEC AND TRANSPORT THITHER WHAT IS LEFT OF THIS RUINED COUNTRY
4335-15081-0013 DO NOT WAIT TILL WAR AND FAMINE HAVE DESTROYED US TO THE LAST MAN WE ARE IN YOUR HANDS DEATH HAS TAKEN FROM YOU MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND OF US IF YOU WAIT LONGER NOT ONE WILL REMAIN ALIVE AND THEN YOU WILL BE SORRY THAT YOU DID NOT SAVE THOSE
4335-15081-0014 TO AN ASYLUM WHERE THERE WAS AT LEAST A HOPE OF SAFETY THEIR RESOLUTION ONCE TAKEN THEY PUSHED THEIR PREPARATIONS WITH ALL SPEED LEST THE IROQUOIS MIGHT LEARN THEIR PURPOSE AND LIE IN WAIT TO CUT THEM OFF
4335-15081-0015 CANOES WERE MADE READY AND ON THE TENTH OF JUNE THEY BEGAN THE VOYAGE WITH ALL THEIR FRENCH FOLLOWERS AND ABOUT THREE HUNDRED HURONS THE HURON MISSION WAS ABANDONED
4335-15081-0016 IT WAS NOT WITHOUT TEARS
4335-15081-0017 NOTHING REMAINING OF THE ALGONQUINS WHO DWELT ON ITS SHORE EXCEPT THE ASHES OF THEIR BURNT WIGWAMS A LITTLE FARTHER ON THERE WAS A FORT BUILT OF TREES WHERE THE IROQUOIS WHO MADE THIS DESOLATION HAD SPENT THE WINTER
4335-15081-0018 AND A LEAGUE OR TWO BELOW THERE WAS ANOTHER SIMILAR FORT THE RIVER OTTAWA WAS A SOLITUDE THE ALGONQUINS OF ALLUMETTE ISLAND AND THE SHORES ADJACENT HAD ALL BEEN KILLED OR DRIVEN AWAY NEVER AGAIN TO RETURN
4335-15081-0019 WRITES RAGUENEAU I FOUND IT BORDERED WITH ALGONQUIN TRIBES WHO KNEW NO GOD AND IN THEIR INFIDELITY THOUGHT THEMSELVES GODS ON EARTH FOR THEY HAD ALL THAT THEY DESIRED
4335-15081-0020 ABUNDANCE OF FISH AND GAME AND A PROSPEROUS TRADE WITH ALLIED NATIONS BESIDES THEY WERE THE TERROR OF THEIR ENEMIES BUT SINCE THEY HAVE EMBRACED THE FAITH AND ADORED THE CROSS OF CHRIST HE HAS GIVEN THEM A HEAVY SHARE IN THIS CROSS
4335-15081-0021 AND MADE THEM A PREY TO MISERY TORTURE AND A CRUEL DEATH IN A WORD THEY ARE A PEOPLE SWEPT FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH OUR ONLY CONSOLATION IS THAT AS THEY DIED CHRISTIANS
4335-15081-0022 IN THE PRECEDING AUTUMN BRESSANI HAD GONE DOWN TO THE FRENCH SETTLEMENTS WITH ABOUT TWENTY HURONS AND WAS NOW RETURNING WITH THEM AND TWICE THEIR NUMBER OF ARMED FRENCHMEN FOR THE DEFENCE OF THE MISSION
4335-15081-0023 HIS SCOUTS HAD ALSO BEEN ALARMED BY DISCOVERING THE FOOTPRINTS OF RAGUENEAU'S INDIANS AND FOR SOME TIME THE TWO PARTIES STOOD ON THEIR GUARD EACH TAKING THE OTHER FOR AN ENEMY WHEN AT LENGTH THEY DISCOVERED THEIR MISTAKE
4335-15081-0024 THEY MET WITH EMBRACES AND REJOICING BRESSANI AND HIS FRENCHMEN HAD COME TOO LATE ALL WAS OVER WITH THE HURONS AND THE HURON MISSION AND AS IT WAS USELESS TO GO FARTHER THEY JOINED RAGUENEAU'S PARTY AND RETRACED THEIR COURSE FOR THE SETTLEMENTS
4335-15081-0025 HUNTING FOR SUBSISTENCE AND WAITING TO WAYLAY SOME PASSING CANOE OF HURONS ALGONQUINS OR FRENCHMEN BRESSANI'S PARTY OUTNUMBERED THEM SIX TO ONE BUT THEY RESOLVED THAT IT SHOULD NOT PASS WITHOUT A TOKEN OF THEIR PRESENCE
4335-15081-0026 LATE ON A DARK NIGHT THE FRENCH AND HURONS LAY ENCAMPED IN THE FOREST SLEEPING ABOUT THEIR FIRES THEY HAD SET GUARDS BUT THESE IT SEEMS WERE DROWSY OR NEGLIGENT FOR THE TEN IROQUOIS WATCHING THEIR TIME APPROACHED WITH THE STEALTH OF LYNXES
4335-15081-0027 AND GLIDED LIKE SHADOWS INTO THE MIDST OF THE CAMP WHERE BY THE DULL GLOW OF THE SMOULDERING FIRES THEY COULD DISTINGUISH THE RECUMBENT FIGURES OF THEIR VICTIMS SUDDENLY THEY SCREECHED THE WAR WHOOP AND STRUCK LIKE LIGHTNING WITH THEIR HATCHETS AMONG THE SLEEPERS
4335-15081-0028 SEVEN WERE KILLED BEFORE THE REST COULD SPRING TO THEIR WEAPONS BRESSANI LEAPED UP AND RECEIVED ON THE INSTANT THREE ARROW WOUNDS IN THE HEAD THE IROQUOIS WERE SURROUNDED AND A DESPERATE FIGHT ENSUED IN THE DARK
4335-15081-0029 SIX OF THEM WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT AND TWO MADE PRISONERS WHILE THE REMAINING TWO BREAKING THROUGH THE CROWD BOUNDED OUT OF THE CAMP AND ESCAPED IN THE FOREST THE UNITED PARTIES SOON AFTER REACHED MONTREAL
4335-15081-0030 BUT THE HURONS REFUSED TO REMAIN IN A SPOT SO EXPOSED TO THE IROQUOIS ACCORDINGLY THEY ALL DESCENDED THE SAINT LAWRENCE AND AT LENGTH ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF JULY REACHED QUEBEC
4335-15081-0031 HERE THE URSULINES THE HOSPITAL NUNS AND THE INHABITANTS TAXED THEIR RESOURCES TO THE UTMOST
4335-15081-0032 A PARTY OF CHRISTIAN INDIANS CHIEFLY FROM SILLERY PLANNED A STROKE OF RETALIATION AND SET OUT FOR THE MOHAWK COUNTRY MARCHING CAUTIOUSLY AND SENDING FORWARD SCOUTS TO SCOUR THE FOREST
4335-15081-0033 ONE OF THESE A HURON SUDDENLY FELL IN WITH A LARGE IROQUOIS WAR PARTY AND SEEING THAT HE COULD NOT ESCAPE FORMED ON THE INSTANT A VILLANOUS PLAN TO SAVE HIMSELF HE RAN TOWARDS THE ENEMY CRYING OUT
4335-15081-0034 THAT HE HAD LONG BEEN LOOKING FOR THEM AND WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE THEM THAT HIS NATION THE HURONS HAD COME TO AN END AND THAT HENCEFORTH HIS COUNTRY WAS THE COUNTRY OF THE IROQUOIS WHERE SO MANY OF HIS KINSMEN AND FRIENDS HAD BEEN ADOPTED
4335-15081-0035 HE HAD COME HE DECLARED WITH NO OTHER THOUGHT THAN THAT OF JOINING THEM AND TURNING IROQUOIS AS THEY HAD DONE THE IROQUOIS DEMANDED IF HE HAD COME ALONE HE ANSWERED NO
4335-15081-0036 AND SAID THAT IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH HIS PURPOSE HE HAD JOINED AN ALGONQUIN WAR PARTY WHO WERE IN THE WOODS NOT FAR OFF THE IROQUOIS IN GREAT DELIGHT DEMANDED TO BE SHOWN WHERE THEY WERE THIS JUDAS AS THE JESUITS CALL HIM
4335-15081-0037 AT ONCE COMPLIED AND THE ALGONQUINS WERE SURPRISED BY A SUDDEN ONSET AND ROUTED WITH SEVERE LOSS THE TREACHEROUS HURON WAS WELL TREATED BY THE IROQUOIS WHO ADOPTED HIM INTO THEIR NATION
4335-15081-0038 NOT LONG AFTER HE CAME TO CANADA AND WITH A VIEW AS IT WAS THOUGHT TO SOME FURTHER TREACHERY REJOINED THE FRENCH A SHARP CROSS QUESTIONING PUT HIM TO CONFUSION
4335-15081-0039 AND TOOK POST WAIST DEEP IN MUD AND WATER AMONG THE TALL RUSHES AT THE MARGIN OF THE RIVER HERE THEY FOUGHT STUBBORNLY AND KEPT ALL THE FRENCHMEN AT BAY AT LENGTH FINDING THEMSELVES HARD PRESSED THEY ENTERED THEIR CANOES AGAIN AND PADDLED OFF
4335-15081-0040 THE FRENCH ROWED AFTER THEM AND SOON BECAME SEPARATED IN THE CHASE WHEREUPON THE IROQUOIS TURNED AND MADE DESPERATE FIGHT WITH THE FOREMOST RETREATING AGAIN AS SOON AS THE OTHERS CAME UP
4335-15081-0041 THIS THEY REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES AND THEN MADE THEIR ESCAPE AFTER KILLING A NUMBER OF THE BEST FRENCH SOLDIERS THEIR LEADER IN THIS AFFAIR WAS A FAMOUS HALF BREED KNOWN AS THE FLEMISH BASTARD WHO IS STYLED BY RAGUENEAU
4335-15081-0042 AN ABOMINATION OF SIN AND A MONSTER PRODUCED BETWEEN A HERETIC DUTCH FATHER AND A PAGAN MOTHER IN THE FORESTS FAR NORTH OF THREE RIVERS DWELT THE TRIBE CALLED THE ATTICAMEGUES OR NATION OF THE WHITE FISH
4335-15081-0043 FROM THEIR REMOTE POSITION AND THE DIFFICULT NATURE OF THE INTERVENING COUNTRY THEY THOUGHT THEMSELVES SAFE BUT A BAND OF IROQUOIS MARCHING ON SNOW SHOES A DISTANCE OF TWENTY DAYS JOURNEY NORTHWARD FROM THE SAINT LAWRENCE
4335-15081-0044 FELL UPON ONE OF THEIR CAMPS IN THE WINTER AND MADE A GENERAL BUTCHERY OF THE INMATES THE TRIBE HOWEVER STILL HELD ITS GROUND FOR A TIME AND BEING ALL GOOD CATHOLICS GAVE THEIR MISSIONARY FATHER BUTEUX
4335-15081-0045 AN URGENT INVITATION TO VISIT THEM IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY BUTEUX WHO HAD LONG BEEN STATIONED AT THREE RIVERS WAS IN ILL HEALTH AND FOR YEARS
4335-15081-0046 GAME WAS EXCEEDINGLY SCARCE AND THEY WERE FORCED BY HUNGER TO SEPARATE A HURON CONVERT AND A FRENCHMAN NAMED FONTARABIE REMAINING WITH THE MISSIONARY THE SNOWS HAD MELTED AND ALL THE STREAMS WERE SWOLLEN
4335-15081-0047 THE THREE TRAVELLERS IN A SMALL BIRCH CANOE PUSHED THEIR WAY UP A TURBULENT RIVER WHERE FALLS AND RAPIDS WERE SO NUMEROUS THAT MANY TIMES DAILY THEY WERE FORCED TO CARRY THEIR BARK VESSEL AND THEIR BAGGAGE THROUGH FORESTS AND THICKETS
4335-15081-0048 AND OVER ROCKS AND PRECIPICES ON THE TENTH OF MAY THEY MADE TWO SUCH PORTAGES AND SOON AFTER REACHING A THIRD FALL AGAIN LIFTED THEIR CANOE FROM THE WATER THEY TOILED THROUGH THE NAKED FOREST AMONG THE WET BLACK TREES OVER TANGLED ROOTS
4335-15081-0049 GREEN SPONGY MOSSES MOULDERING LEAVES AND ROTTEN PROSTRATE TRUNKS WHILE THE CATARACT FOAMED AMIDST THE ROCKS HARD BY THE INDIAN LED THE WAY WITH THE CANOE ON HIS HEAD WHILE BUTEUX AND THE OTHER FRENCHMAN FOLLOWED WITH THE BAGGAGE
4335-15081-0050 SUDDENLY THEY WERE SET UPON BY A TROOP OF IROQUOIS WHO HAD CROUCHED BEHIND THICKETS ROCKS AND FALLEN TREES TO WAYLAY THEM THE HURON WAS CAPTURED BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO FLY
4335-15081-0051 BUTEUX AND THE FRENCHMAN TRIED TO ESCAPE BUT WERE INSTANTLY SHOT DOWN THE JESUIT RECEIVING TWO BALLS IN THE BREAST THE IROQUOIS RUSHED UPON THEM MANGLED THEIR BODIES WITH TOMAHAWKS AND SWORDS STRIPPED THEM
