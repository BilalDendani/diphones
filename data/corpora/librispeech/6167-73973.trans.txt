6167-73973-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE NOVELTY AND VARIETY WHEN I LOOK BACK OVER THIRTY YEARS OF GARDENING I SEE WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS THERE HAS BEEN NOT ONLY IN THE INTRODUCTION OF GOOD PLANTS NEW TO GENERAL CULTIVATION
6167-73973-0001 BUT ALSO IN THE HOME PRODUCTION OF IMPROVED KINDS OF OLD FAVOURITES
6167-73973-0002 THERE HAS BEEN A REMARKABLE ADVANCE AND HERE AGAIN THOUGH MANY REALLY BEAUTIFUL THINGS ARE BEING BROUGHT FORWARD THERE SEEMS ALWAYS TO BE AN UNDUE VALUE ASSIGNED TO A FRESH DEVELOPMENT ON THE SCORE OF ITS NOVELTY
6167-73973-0003 NOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT AMONG THE THOUSANDS OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS ALREADY AT HAND FOR GARDEN USE THERE IS NO MERIT WHATEVER IN NOVELTY OR VARIETY UNLESS THE THING NEW OR DIFFERENT IS DISTINCTLY MORE BEAUTIFUL
6167-73973-0004 OR IN SOME SUCH WAY BETTER THAN AN OLDER THING OF THE SAME CLASS AND THERE SEEMS TO BE A GENERAL WISH AMONG SEED GROWERS JUST NOW TO DWARF ALL ANNUAL PLANTS
6167-73973-0005 MAY BE A DISTINCT GAIN TO HORTICULTURE IT MAY JUST MAKE A GOOD GARDEN PLANT OUT OF ONE THAT WAS FORMERLY OF INDIFFERENT QUALITY BUT THERE SEEMS TO ME TO BE A KIND OF STUPIDITY
6167-73973-0006 IN INFERRING FROM THIS THAT ALL ANNUALS ARE THE BETTER FOR DWARFING I TAKE IT THAT THE BEDDING SYSTEM HAS HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO WITH IT IT NO DOUBT ENABLES IGNORANT GARDENERS TO USE A LARGER VARIETY OF PLANTS
6167-73973-0007 BUT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT MANY IF NOT MOST OF THE PLANTS ARE INDIVIDUALLY MADE MUCH UGLIER BY THE PROCESS TAKE FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE DWARFEST AGERATUMS
6167-73973-0008 WHAT A SILLY LITTLE DUMPY FORMLESS PINCUSHION OF A THING IT IS AND THEN THE DWARFEST OF THE CHINA ASTERS HERE IS A PLANT WHOSE CHIEF WEAKNESS ALREADY LIES IN A CERTAIN OVER STIFFNESS MADE STIFFER
6167-73973-0009 AND MORE SHAPELESS STILL BY DWARFING AND BY CRAMMING WITH TOO MANY PETALS THE COMET ASTERS OF LATER YEARS ARE A MUCH IMPROVED TYPE OF FLOWER WITH A LOOSER SHAPE AND A CERTAIN DEGREE OF APPROACH TO GRACE AND BEAUTY
6167-73973-0010 WHEN THIS KIND CAME OUT IT WAS A NOTEWORTHY NOVELTY NOT BECAUSE IT WAS A NOVELTY BUT BECAUSE IT WAS A BETTER AND MORE BEAUTIFUL THING
6167-73973-0011 THE INTRODUCTION OF A BETTER CLASS OF RED COLOURING
6167-73973-0012 WHOSE RED AND PINK COLOURINGS HAD HITHERTO BEEN OF A BAD AND RANK QUALITY IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT HERE AND THERE THE DWARF KIND IS A DISTINCTLY USEFUL THING
6167-73973-0013 IN THIS GRAND PLANT ONE IS GLAD TO HAVE DWARF ONES AS WELL AS THE OLD TRAILING KINDS
6167-73973-0014 FOR THE PODGY LITTLE DWARF SNAPDRAGONS THEY ARE UNGRACEFUL LITTLE DUMPY THINGS
6167-73973-0015 THAT GIVE THEM A KIND OF ABSURD PRETTINESS AND A CERTAIN GARDEN VALUE I ALSO LOOK AT THEM AS A LITTLE FLORAL JOKE THAT IS HARMLESS AND NOT DISPLEASING
6167-73973-0016 ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST INTERESTING AND ADMIRABLE OF GARDEN PLANTS
6167-73973-0017 IN A SMALL GARDEN OF A TYPE THAT I THOUGHT EXTREMELY DESIRABLE WITH A DOUBLE FLOWER OF JUST THE RIGHT DEGREE OF FULNESS AND OF AN UNUSUALLY FINE COLOUR I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GET SOME SEED
6167-73973-0018 NOR HAVE I EVER SEEN ELSEWHERE ANY THAT I THINK CAN COMPARE WITH IT
6167-73973-0019 WHEN A ZINNIA HAS A HARD STIFF TALL FLOWER WITH A GREAT MANY ROWS OF PETALS PILED UP ONE ON TOP OF ANOTHER AND WHEN ITS HABIT IS DWARFED TO A MEAN DEGREE OF SQUATNESS IT LOOKS TO ME BOTH UGLY AND ABSURD
6167-73973-0020 WHEREAS A REASONABLY DOUBLE ONE WELL BRANCHED AND TWO FEET HIGH IS A HANDSOME PLANT I ALSO THINK THAT STOCKS AND WALLFLOWERS ARE MUCH HANDSOMER WHEN RATHER TALL AND BRANCHING DWARF STOCKS MOREOVER
6167-73973-0021 ARE INVARIABLY SPATTERED WITH SOIL IN HEAVY AUTUMN RAIN AN EXAMPLE OF THE IMPROVER NOT KNOWING WHERE TO STOP IN THE MATTER OF COLOURING ALWAYS STRIKES ME IN THE GAILLARDIAS
6167-73973-0022 THAT IS INCREASED BY DIVISION AS WELL AS BY SEED
6167-73973-0023 WITH A NARROW RING OF RED ROUND THE CENTRE THE IMPROVER HAS SOUGHT TO INCREASE THE WIDTH OF THE RED RING UP TO A CERTAIN POINT IT MAKES A LIVELIER AND BRIGHTER LOOKING FLOWER BUT HE HAS GONE TOO FAR AND EXTENDED THE RED
6167-73973-0024 THE RED ALSO IS OF A RATHER DULL AND HEAVY NATURE SO THAT INSTEAD OF A HANDSOME YELLOW FLOWER WITH A BROAD CENTRAL RING HERE IS AN UGLY RED ONE WITH A YELLOW BORDER THERE IS NO POSITIVE HARM DONE
6167-73973-0025 AS THE PLANT HAS BEEN PROPAGATED AT EVERY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT AND ONE MAY CHOOSE WHAT ONE WILL BUT TO SEE THEM TOGETHER IS AN INSTRUCTIVE LESSON NO ANNUAL PLANT
6167-73973-0026 HAS OF LATE YEARS BEEN SO MUCH IMPROVED AS THE SWEET PEA AND ONE REASON WHY ITS CHARMING BEAUTY AND SCENT ARE SO ENJOYABLE IS THAT THEY GROW TALL AND CAN BE SEEN ON A LEVEL WITH THE EYE
6167-73973-0027 THERE CAN BE NO EXCUSE WHATEVER FOR DWARFING THIS AS HAS LATELY BEEN DONE THERE ARE ALREADY PLENTY OF GOOD FLOWERING PLANTS UNDER A FOOT HIGH AND THE LITTLE DWARF WHITE MONSTROSITY
6167-73973-0028 NOW BEING FOLLOWED BY COLOURED ONES OF THE SAME HABIT SEEMS TO ME WORTHY OF NOTHING BUT CONDEMNATION IT WOULD BE AS RIGHT AND SENSIBLE TO DWARF A HOLLYHOCK INTO A PODGY MASS A FOOT HIGH
6167-73973-0029 OR A FOXGLOVE HAPPILY THESE HAVE AS YET ESCAPED DWARFING THOUGH I REGRET TO SEE THAT A DEFORMITY THAT NOT UNFREQUENTLY APPEARS AMONG GARDEN FOXGLOVES LOOKING LIKE A BELL SHAPED FLOWER
6167-73973-0030 TOPPING A STUNTED SPIKE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN FIXED AND IS BEING OFFERED AS A NOVELTY HERE IS ONE OF THE CLEAREST EXAMPLES OF A NEW DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS A DISTINCT DEBASEMENT OF A NATURALLY BEAUTIFUL FORM
6167-73973-0031 BUT WHICH IS NEVERTHELESS BEING PUSHED FORWARD IN TRADE IT HAS NO MERIT WHATEVER IN ITSELF AND IS ONLY LIKELY TO SELL BECAUSE IT IS NEW AND CURIOUS AND ALL THIS PARADE OF DISTORTION AND DEFORMITY
6167-73973-0032 COMES ABOUT FROM THE GROWER LOSING SIGHT OF BEAUTY AS THE FIRST CONSIDERATION OR FROM HIS NOT HAVING THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO DETERMINE WHAT ARE THE POINTS OF CHARACTER IN VARIOUS PLANTS MOST DESERVING OF DEVELOPMENT
6167-73973-0033 AND IN NOT KNOWING WHEN OR WHERE TO STOP ABNORMAL SIZE WHETHER GREATLY ABOVE OR MUCH BELOW THE AVERAGE APPEALS TO THE VULGAR AND UNEDUCATED EYE AND WILL ALWAYS COMMAND ITS ATTENTION AND WONDERMENT
6167-73973-0034 BUT THEN THE PRODUCTION OF THE IMMENSE SIZE THAT PROVOKES ASTONISHMENT AND THE MISAPPLIED INGENUITY THAT PRODUCES UNUSUAL DWARFING ARE NEITHER OF THEM VERY HIGH AIMS
6167-73973-0035 AND MUCH AS I FEEL GRATEFUL TO THOSE WHO IMPROVE GARDEN FLOWERS I VENTURE TO REPEAT MY STRONG CONVICTION THAT THEIR EFFORTS IN SELECTION AND OTHER METHODS SHOULD BE SO DIRECTED
6167-73973-0036 AS TO KEEP IN VIEW THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY IN THE FIRST PLACE AND AS A POINT OF HONOUR NOT TO MERE INCREASE OF SIZE OF BLOOM OR COMPACTNESS OF HABIT MANY PLANTS HAVE BEEN SPOILT BY EXCESS OF BOTH
6167-73973-0037 NOT FOR VARIETY OR NOVELTY AS ENDS IN THEMSELVES BUT ONLY TO WELCOME THEM AND OFFER THEM IF THEY ARE DISTINCTLY OF GARDEN VALUE IN THE BEST SENSE FOR IF PLANTS ARE GROWN OR ADVERTISED OR OTHERWISE PUSHED
6167-73973-0038 THEY BECOME OF THE SAME NATURE AS ANY OTHER ARTICLE IN TRADE THAT IS GOT UP FOR SALE FOR THE SOLE BENEFIT OF THE SELLER THAT IS UNDULY LAUDED BY ADVERTISEMENT AND THAT MAKES ITS FIRST APPEAL TO THE VULGAR EYE
6167-73973-0039 BY AN EXAGGERATED AND SHOWY PICTORIAL REPRESENTATION THAT WILL SERVE NO USEFUL PURPOSE AND FOR WHICH THERE IS NO TRUE OR HEALTHY DEMAND NO DOUBT MUCH OF IT COMES ABOUT FROM THE UNWHOLESOME PRESSURE OF TRADE COMPETITION
6167-73973-0040 WHICH IN A WAY OBLIGES ALL TO FOLLOW WHERE SOME LEAD I TRUST
6167-73973-0041 BEING ALL BOUND IN A KIND OF BONDAGE TO THE GENERAL SYSTEM AND THERE IS ONE GREAT EVIL THAT CALLS LOUDLY FOR REDRESS
