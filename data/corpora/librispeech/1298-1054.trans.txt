1298-1054-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN A HOLE IN THE WALL MY TAKING THE DETECTIVE OUT TO SUNNYSIDE RAISED AN UNEXPECTED STORM OF PROTEST FROM GERTRUDE AND HALSEY I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR IT
1298-1054-0001 AND I SCARCELY KNEW HOW TO ACCOUNT FOR IT TO ME MISTER JAMIESON WAS FAR LESS FORMIDABLE UNDER MY EYES WHERE I KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING
1298-1054-0002 TWISTING CIRCUMSTANCES AND MOTIVES TO SUIT HIMSELF AND LEARNING WHAT HE WISHED TO KNOW ABOUT EVENTS AT SUNNYSIDE IN SOME OCCULT WAY I WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO HAVE HIM THERE WHEN EXCITEMENTS BEGAN TO COME THICK AND FAST
1298-1054-0003 A NEW ELEMENT WAS ABOUT TO ENTER INTO AFFAIRS MONDAY OR TUESDAY AT THE LATEST WOULD FIND DOCTOR WALKER BACK IN HIS GREEN AND WHITE HOUSE IN THE VILLAGE AND LOUISE'S ATTITUDE TO HIM IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE
1298-1054-0004 WOULD SIGNIFY HALSEY'S HAPPINESS OR WRETCHEDNESS AS IT MIGHT TURN OUT THEN TOO
1298-1054-0005 FROM THE DAY MISTER JAMIESON CAME TO SUNNYSIDE THERE WAS A SUBTLE CHANGE IN GERTRUDE'S MANNER TO ME IT WAS ELUSIVE DIFFICULT TO ANALYZE BUT IT WAS THERE
1298-1054-0006 GERTRUDE SPENT MUCH OF HER TIME WANDERING THROUGH THE GROUNDS OR TAKING LONG CROSS COUNTRY WALKS HALSEY PLAYED GOLF AT THE COUNTRY CLUB DAY AFTER DAY AND AFTER LOUISE LEFT AS SHE DID THE FOLLOWING WEEK
1298-1054-0007 HE PLAYED A FAIR GAME OF CRIBBAGE BUT HE CHEATED AT SOLITAIRE THE NIGHT THE DETECTIVE ARRIVED SATURDAY I HAD A TALK WITH HIM I TOLD HIM OF THE EXPERIENCE LOUISE ARMSTRONG HAD HAD THE NIGHT BEFORE ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE
1298-1054-0008 I SAW THAT HE THOUGHT THE INFORMATION WAS IMPORTANT AND TO MY SUGGESTION THAT WE PUT AN ADDITIONAL LOCK ON THE EAST WING DOOR HE OPPOSED A STRONG NEGATIVE I THINK IT PROBABLE HE SAID THAT OUR VISITOR WILL BE BACK AGAIN
1298-1054-0009 TO AVOID ROUSING SUSPICION THEN I CAN WATCH FOR AT LEAST A PART OF EACH NIGHT AND PROBABLY MISTER INNES WILL HELP US OUT I WOULD SAY AS LITTLE TO THOMAS AS POSSIBLE THE OLD MAN KNOWS MORE THAN HE IS WILLING TO ADMIT
1298-1054-0010 I SUGGESTED THAT ALEX THE GARDENER WOULD PROBABLY BE WILLING TO HELP AND MISTER JAMIESON UNDERTOOK TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENT FOR ONE NIGHT HOWEVER MISTER JAMIESON PREFERRED TO WATCH ALONE APPARENTLY NOTHING OCCURRED
1298-1054-0011 THE DETECTIVE SAT IN ABSOLUTE DARKNESS ON THE LOWER STEP OF THE STAIRS DOZING HE SAID AFTERWARDS NOW AND THEN NOTHING COULD PASS HIM IN EITHER DIRECTION AND THE DOOR IN THE MORNING REMAINED AS SECURELY FASTENED AS IT HAD BEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
1298-1054-0012 AND YET ONE OF THE MOST INEXPLICABLE OCCURRENCES OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR TOOK PLACE THAT VERY NIGHT LIDDY CAME TO MY ROOM ON SUNDAY MORNING WITH A FACE AS LONG AS THE MORAL LAW SHE LAID OUT MY THINGS AS USUAL
1298-1054-0013 BUT I MISSED HER CUSTOMARY GARRULOUSNESS I WAS NOT REGALED WITH THE NEW COOK'S EXTRAVAGANCE AS TO EGGS AND SHE EVEN FORBORE TO MENTION THAT JAMIESON ON WHOSE ARRIVAL SHE HAD LOOKED WITH SILENT DISFAVOR WHAT'S THE MATTER LIDDY
1298-1054-0014 I ASKED AT LAST DIDN'T YOU SLEEP LAST NIGHT
1298-1054-0015 SHE SAID STIFFLY DID YOU HAVE TWO CUPS OF COFFEE AT YOUR DINNER I INQUIRED NO MA'M INDIGNANTLY I SAT UP AND ALMOST UPSET MY HOT WATER I ALWAYS TAKE A CUP OF HOT WATER WITH A PINCH OF SALT BEFORE I GET UP
1298-1054-0016 THROUGH GOOD TEMPER AND BAD THE IDEA
1298-1054-0017 BUT I GUESS I CAN'T STAND IT ANY LONGER MY TRUNK'S PACKED WHO PACKED IT I ASKED EXPECTING FROM HER TONE TO BE TOLD SHE HAD WAKENED TO FIND IT DONE BY SOME GHOSTLY HAND I DID MISS RACHEL YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU THIS HOUSE IS
1298-1054-0018 I'M DOING MY BEST TO FIND OUT I SAID WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU DRIVING AT SHE DREW A LONG BREATH THERE IS A HOLE IN THE TRUNK ROOM WALL DUG OUT SINCE LAST NIGHT
1298-1054-0019 IT'S BIG ENOUGH TO PUT YOUR HEAD IN AND THE PLASTER'S ALL OVER THE PLACE
1298-1054-0020 BUT LIDDY CLENCHED THAT JUST ASK ALEX SHE SAID WHEN HE PUT THE NEW COOK'S TRUNK THERE LAST NIGHT THE WALL WAS AS SMOOTH AS THIS THIS MORNING IT'S DUG OUT AND THERE'S PLASTER ON THE COOK'S TRUNK MISS RACHEL
1298-1054-0021 AND YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ANYTHING THERE'S SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T HANDCUFF
1298-1054-0022 I WENT UP TO THE TRUNK ROOM WHICH WAS DIRECTLY OVER MY BEDROOM THE PLAN OF THE UPPER STORY OF THE HOUSE WAS LIKE THAT OF THE SECOND FLOOR IN THE MAIN ONE END HOWEVER OVER THE EAST WING HAD BEEN LEFT ONLY ROUGHLY FINISHED
1298-1054-0023 THE INTENTION HAVING BEEN TO CONVERT IT INTO A BALL ROOM AT SOME FUTURE TIME
1298-1054-0024 OPENED FROM A LONG CORRIDOR LIKE THAT ON THE SECOND FLOOR AND IN THE TRUNK ROOM AS LIDDY HAD SAID WAS A FRESH BREAK IN THE PLASTER
1298-1054-0025 I REACHED INTO THE OPENING AND THREE FEET AWAY PERHAPS I COULD TOUCH THE BRICKS OF THE PARTITION WALL FOR SOME REASON THE ARCHITECT IN BUILDING THE HOUSE HAD LEFT A SPACE THERE THAT STRUCK ME EVEN IN THE SURPRISE OF THE DISCOVERY
1298-1054-0026 AS AN EXCELLENT PLACE FOR A CONFLAGRATION TO GAIN HEADWAY YOU ARE SURE THE HOLE WAS NOT HERE YESTERDAY I ASKED LIDDY WHOSE EXPRESSION WAS A MIXTURE OF SATISFACTION AND ALARM
1298-1054-0027 IN ANSWER SHE POINTED TO THE NEW COOK'S TRUNK THAT NECESSARY ADJUNCT OF THE MIGRATORY DOMESTIC THE TOP WAS COVERED WITH FINE WHITE PLASTER AS WAS THE FLOOR BUT THERE WERE NO LARGE PIECES OF MORTAR LYING AROUND NO BITS OF LATHING
1298-1054-0028 BEING QUITE CONFIDENT THAT THE GAP WAS OF UNHOLY ORIGIN SHE DID NOT CONCERN HERSELF WITH SUCH TRIFLES AS A BIT OF MORTAR AND LATH NO DOUBT THEY WERE EVEN THEN HEAPED NEATLY ON A GRAVESTONE IN THE CASANOVA CHURCHYARD
1298-1054-0029 I BROUGHT MISTER JAMIESON UP TO SEE THE HOLE IN THE WALL DIRECTLY AFTER BREAKFAST HIS EXPRESSION WAS VERY ODD WHEN HE LOOKED AT IT AND THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO TRY TO DISCOVER WHAT OBJECT IF ANY SUCH A HOLE COULD HAVE
1298-1054-0030 HE GOT A PIECE OF CANDLE AND BY ENLARGING THE APERTURE A LITTLE WAS ABLE TO EXAMINE WHAT LAY BEYOND THE RESULT WAS NIL THE TRUNK ROOM ALTHOUGH HEATED BY STEAM HEAT LIKE THE REST OF THE HOUSE
1298-1054-0031 BOASTED OF A FIREPLACE AND MANTEL AS WELL THE OPENING HAD BEEN MADE BETWEEN THE FLUE AND THE OUTER WALL OF THE HOUSE THERE WAS REVEALED HOWEVER ON INSPECTION ONLY THE BRICK OF THE CHIMNEY ON ONE SIDE AND THE OUTER WALL OF THE HOUSE ON THE OTHER
1298-1054-0032 IN DEPTH THE SPACE EXTENDED ONLY TO THE FLOORING THE BREACH HAD BEEN MADE ABOUT FOUR FEET FROM THE FLOOR AND INSIDE WERE ALL THE MISSING BITS OF PLASTER IT HAD BEEN A METHODICAL GHOST
1298-1054-0033 IT WAS VERY MUCH OF A DISAPPOINTMENT I HAD EXPECTED A SECRET ROOM AT THE VERY LEAST AND I THINK EVEN MISTER JAMIESON HAD FANCIED HE MIGHT AT LAST HAVE A CLUE TO THE MYSTERY THERE WAS EVIDENTLY NOTHING MORE TO BE DISCOVERED
1298-1054-0034 LIDDY REPORTED THAT EVERYTHING WAS SERENE AMONG THE SERVANTS AND THAT NONE OF THEM HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY THE NOISE THE MADDENING THING HOWEVER WAS THAT THE NIGHTLY VISITOR HAD EVIDENTLY MORE THAN ONE WAY OF GAINING ACCESS TO THE HOUSE AND
1298-1054-0035 WE MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO REDOUBLE OUR VIGILANCE AS TO WINDOWS AND DOORS THAT NIGHT HALSEY WAS INCLINED TO POOH POOH THE WHOLE AFFAIR HE SAID A BREAK IN THE PLASTER MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED MONTHS AGO AND GONE UNNOTICED
1298-1054-0036 AND THAT THE DUST HAD PROBABLY BEEN STIRRED UP THE DAY BEFORE AFTER ALL WE HAD TO LET IT GO AT THAT BUT WE PUT IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE SUNDAY GERTRUDE WENT TO CHURCH AND HALSEY TOOK A LONG WALK IN THE MORNING
1298-1054-0037 LOUISE WAS ABLE TO SIT UP AND SHE ALLOWED HALSEY AND LIDDY TO ASSIST HER DOWN STAIRS LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THE EAST VERANDA WAS SHADY GREEN WITH VINES AND PALMS CHEERFUL WITH CUSHIONS AND LOUNGING CHAIRS
1298-1054-0038 WE PUT LOUISE IN A STEAMER CHAIR AND SHE SAT THERE PASSIVELY ENOUGH HER HANDS CLASPED IN HER LAP WE WERE VERY SILENT
1298-1054-0039 HALSEY SAT ON THE RAIL WITH A PIPE OPENLY WATCHING LOUISE AS SHE LOOKED BROODINGLY ACROSS THE VALLEY TO THE HILLS THERE WAS SOMETHING BAFFLING IN THE GIRL'S EYES AND GRADUALLY HALSEY'S BOYISH FEATURES
1298-1054-0040 LOST THEIR GLOW AT SEEING HER ABOUT AGAIN AND SETTLED INTO GRIM LINES HE WAS LIKE HIS FATHER JUST THEN WE SAT UNTIL LATE AFTERNOON HALSEY GROWING MORE AND MORE MOODY SHORTLY BEFORE SIX HE GOT UP
1298-1054-0041 AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND IN A FEW MINUTES HE CAME OUT AND CALLED ME TO THE TELEPHONE IT WAS ANNA WHITCOMB IN TOWN AND SHE KEPT ME FOR TWENTY MINUTES TELLING ME THE CHILDREN HAD HAD THE MEASLES AND HOW
1298-1054-0042 MADAME SWEENY HAD BOTCHED HER NEW GOWN WHEN I FINISHED LIDDY WAS BEHIND ME HER MOUTH A THIN LINE I WISH YOU WOULD TRY TO LOOK CHEERFUL LIDDY I GROANED YOUR FACE WOULD SOUR MILK
1298-1054-0043 BUT LIDDY SELDOM REPLIED TO MY GIBES SHE FOLDED HER LIPS A LITTLE TIGHTER HE CALLED HER UP SHE SAID ORACULARLY HE CALLED HER UP
1298-1054-0044 SO HE COULD TALK TO MISS LOUISE A THANKLESS CHILD IS SHARPER THAN A SERPENT'S TOOTH NONSENSE I SAID BRUSKLY I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN ENOUGH TO LEAVE THEM IT'S A LONG TIME SINCE YOU AND I WERE IN LOVE LIDDY AND
1298-1054-0045 WE FORGET LIDDY SNIFFED
