3675-187020-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE AS SOON AS THE NIGHT WAS DARK ENOUGH CHRIS LOUDLY COMPLAINED OF NOT FEELING WELL OF BEING HOT AND DIZZY AND IN NO TIME CAPTAIN BLIZZARD HAD AS LOUDLY TOLD HIM HE WAS TO GO TO BED ON A COT IN THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN
3675-187020-0001 CAPTAIN BLIZZARD CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM AND IN AMOS'S AND NED CILLEY'S HEARING
3675-187020-0002 CHRIS REMAINED ALONE IN THE CABIN FROM THAT TIME SOON IN THE COOL OF THE NIGHT THE SAILORS OF THE MIRABELLE
3675-187020-0003 TAKING WITH THEM CASKS AND BARRELS TO REPLENISH THE SHIP'S WATER SUPPLY THEIR DEEP VOICES SWEPT BACK OVER THE WATER TO WHERE CHRIS STOOD BY THE OPEN PORT OF THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN HE WAS FORCING HIMSELF TOWARD THE MOMENT WHEN HE MUST BOARD THE VULTURE
3675-187020-0004 HIS RESOLVE WAS HELD BACK BY HIS MOUNTING ANXIETY AS TO HOW BEST TO CARRY OUT WHAT WOULD BE NECESSARY AND A STRONG NATURAL RELUCTANCE TO LEAVE THE MIRABELLE LEAVE IT HE MUST
3675-187020-0005 AND WHEN HE HEARD THE CRY OF A BELATED NIGHT BIRD AND SAW IT COAST BY ON SILENT WINGS TO VANISH IN THE NIGHT HE DECIDED TO TAKE THAT SHAPE IT TOOK ALL HIS COURAGE AND DETERMINATION BUT THIS WAS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD WHAT HE HAD TRAINED FOR SO LONG TO DO
3675-187020-0006 AND HE KNEW HE MUST DO IT AND AT ONCE THE BOY LOOKED A LAST TIME AROUND THE CABIN THEN SPOKE THE MAGIC FORMULA IN HIS MIND AND WITH A SUDDEN ENJOYMENT IN THE SENSE OF FLIGHT HE SOARED AWAY FROM THE SHIP
3675-187020-0007 RISING HIGHER AS IT WENT BELOW THE FEW LIGHTS OF THE SHIP HAD BEEN CAREFULLY HOODED AWAY FROM THE SEA
3675-187020-0008 SHE WAS RIDING AT ANCHOR CLOSE INSHORE FARTHER DOWN THE COAST AND FINAL BOATFULS OF MEN WERE RETURNING FROM THE MERCHANTMAN CARRYING THE LAST OF THE SPOILS SWEEPING BY TOWARD THE BEACH CHRIS SAW THAT MOST OF THE BANDIT CREW WERE ALREADY DRUNK
3675-187020-0009 SHOUTING AND CAROUSING AROUND FIRES WHERE THEY ROASTED WILD CREATURES THEY HAD EARLIER KILLED HE NOTICED THAT A FEW TAHITIANS STOOD APART AT THE JOINING OF THE PALM FORESTS AND THE SAND WATCHING THE COARSE FACES OF THE DRUNKEN MEN
3675-187020-0010 THE TAHITIANS FITTING SO WELL INTO THE BEAUTY OF THEIR ISLAND GOLD OF SKIN AND CROWNED WITH FLOWERS CARRYING THEMSELVES WITH DIGNITY WERE AS FAR REMOVED AS COULD BE IMAGINED FROM THE IDEA OF PAGAN MEN
3675-187020-0011 THEY CONTRASTED SHARPLY AT THAT MOMENT WITH THOSE FROM CIVILIZATION
3675-187020-0012 STAGGERED ABOUT AIMLESSLY GORGING FOOD AND DRINKING THE WATCHING PAGANS GLANCED FROM THE BRAWLING PIRATES BACK A SHORT DISTANCE DOWN THE BEACH WHERE ALREADY A FEW BODIES HAD BEEN WASHED ASHORE FROM THE FIGHT THEIR DISTASTE AND BEWILDERMENT WERE PLAIN
3675-187020-0013 CHRIS SOARED HIGH ABOVE THE DIN AND THE SMOKE OF THE FIRES AND THEN SEEING OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY BEING ROWED BACK TO THE VULTURE FOLLOWED AFTER OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY HAD TWO BASKETS AT HIS FEET
3675-187020-0014 HASTILY CHANGING HIMSELF INTO A GREEN PARAKEET CHRIS ALIGHTED ON THE RAIL OF THE VULTURE JUST AS OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY REACHED THE TOP OF THE LADDER DETERMINED TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION AND PERHAPS CATCH OSTERBRIDGE'S FANCY
3675-187020-0015 CHRIS IN HIS BRIGHT PARAKEET PLUMAGE BOBBED HIS HEAD AND SIDLED UP AND DOWN THE SHIP'S RAIL EYEING OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AS HE HAD SEEN PARAKEETS DO THE MANEUVER SUCCEEDED
3675-187020-0016 DECLARED HIMSELF ENCHANTED I MUST HAVE THAT LITTLE BIRD HE EXCLAIMED AND CAREFULLY TAKING OFF HIS FASHIONABLE HAT EVEN MORE OUT OF PLACE IN THE TROPICS THAN IT HAD BEEN ON THE GEORGETOWN DOCKS HE SLAPPED IT QUICKLY OVER THE PARAKEET
3675-187020-0017 WHICH ALLOWED ITSELF TO BE CAPTURED THIS OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY'S OWN PRIZE MADE HIM CROW WITH DELIGHT CLAMBERING AS GRACEFULLY AS POSSIBLE OVER THE BATTLE SCARRED SIDE OF THE VULTURE HE TOOK THE PARAKEET GENTLY OUT FROM UNDER HIS TRICORNE
3675-187020-0018 MY SOUL WHAT A PRIZE HE RATTLED ON ENTIRELY TO HIMSELF AS IT TURNED OUT FOR THE SAILORS WERE NOT AT ALL INTERESTED IN A PET EXHAUSTED FROM THE BATTLE OR DRUNK FROM CAPTURED WINE AND ALL DESPISING THE FASTIDIOUS WAYS OF OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY
3675-187020-0019 THEY PAID NOT THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION THEY OBEYED OCCASIONAL ORDERS FROM HIM FOR THEY KNEW THEY WOULD BE WHIPPED BY CLAGGETT CHEW IF THEY DID NOT AND SO HAULED UP THE BASKETS OF FRUITS AND FLOWERS DUMPED THEM UNCEREMONIOUSLY IN THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN
3675-187020-0020 AND LEFT AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD TO REJOIN THEIR SHIPMATES ON SHORE HOLDING THE PARAKEET FIRMLY OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY TIED A LONG SILK CORD TO ITS RIGHT LEG FASTENING THE OTHER END TO THE ARM OF HIS CHAIR SO THAT HE COULD CLOSELY OBSERVE HIS NEW PET
3675-187020-0021 CHRIS DID NOT DISAPPOINT HIM AS THE PARAKEET HE PLAYED THE CLOWN FOR ALL HE WAS WORTH HE STRUTTED UP AND DOWN AND BOBBED HIS HEAD WHENEVER OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY SPOKE SO THAT IT APPEARED THAT THE BRIGHTLY FEATHERED BIRD WAS IN CONSTANT AGREEMENT WITH HIS CAPTOR
3675-187020-0022 OR HE WOULD COCK HIS HEAD TO ONE SIDE AS IF WEIGHING ONE OF OSTERBRIDGE'S REMARKS IN A TRULY COMICAL MANNER LOOKING ABOUT MEANWHILE WITH HIS BLACK BEADY EYES CHRIS SAW THAT CLAGGETT CHEW WAS LYING IN A BUNK AGAINST ONE WALL
3675-187020-0023 NURSING HIS LEFT LEG WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN A SWORD THRUST IN THE FIGHT HE WAS OBVIOUSLY IN PAIN AND PERHAPS FEVERISH AND OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY'S CHILDISH TALK IRRITATED AND BORED HIM SO THAT HE TURNED HIS FACE TO THE WALL
3675-187020-0024 LIGHT FROM THE SWINGING LAMP THAT CHRIS REMEMBERED FROM MANY WEEKS BEFORE THREW BLACK HOLLOWS INTO CLAGGETT CHEW'S EYE SOCKETS AND DEEPLY LINED FACE NOW AND AGAIN HE COULD BE HEARD GRINDING HIS TEETH AT THE PAIN OF HIS WOUND
3675-187020-0025 BUT OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY THROWING HIS FINE COAT AND PLUMED HAT TO ONE SIDE LIGHTHEARTEDLY AMUSED HIMSELF BY TRYING TO TEMPT HIS NEW PET WITH SOME FRUIT CLAGGETT HE CRIED AS IF CLAGGETT CHEW COULD POSSIBLY BE INTERESTED IN A PARAKEET AT THAT POINT
3675-187020-0026 DO LOOK AT WHAT I CAPTURED THIS IS MY VERY OWN SPOILS OF WAR HE CROWED CLAGGETT CHEW MADE AN IMPOLITE NOISE AND SAID NOTHING WELL OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY GAVE A SHRUG AS ANSWER TO THE NOISE YOU KNOW HOW I DETEST FIGHTING
3675-187020-0027 NOW A GOOD GENTLEMANLY FIGHT WITH A RAPIER IS QUITE ANOTHER THING HE WENT ON HE SMIRKED AND MADE A FACE AT THE PARAKEET WHO DID ITS BEST TO SMIRK BACK THAT IS A GRACEFUL AND FINE ART
3675-187020-0028 NO SOUND FROM CLAGGETT CHEW OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY RATTLED ON AND CHRIS PECKING AT THE FRUIT PROFFERED HIM THOUGHT THAT SOMETIMES OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY MIGHT QUITE POSSIBLY TALK JUST AS GAILY TO HIMSELF AS HE DID TO THE UNRESPONSIVE CLAGGETT CHEW
3675-187020-0029 CLAGGETT YOUR MEN HIS VOICE ROSE REALLY
3675-187020-0030 EXHIBITION OF THEMSELVES ON THE BEACH
3675-187020-0031 QUITE REVOLTING HOW CAN YOU BEAR TO ASSOCIATE WITH SUCH TYPES WHEN YOU ARE SO MUCH ABOVE THEM YOURSELF BUT THERE I MUST NOT PIQUE YOU MUST I POOR CLAGGETT I EXPECT YOUR WOUND SMARTS A TRIFLE
3675-187020-0032 CLAGGETT CHEW TURNED HIS FACE TOWARD OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY HIS EYES BLAZING WITH RAGE AND HIS MOUTH WORKING WITH THE FRETFUL ANNOYANCE OF AN ILL MAN BUT HE ONLY MUTTERED AND TURNED AWAY AGAIN
3675-187020-0033 HIS MORE DELICATE FRIEND PURSUED STRETCHING OUT A LONG FINGER FOR THE PARAKEET TO PERCH ON WHICH TO HIS EVIDENT PLEASURE IT INSTANTLY DID
3675-187020-0034 HE PAUSED ADMIRING THE VIVID COLORS OF THE FEATHERS WHICH PERHAPS AWOKE A KINDRED FEELING IN OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY
3675-187020-0035 MY LITTLE FEATHERED CAPTIVE HE SAID AND PONDERED
3675-187020-0036 SOMETHING FRENCH UNDOUBTEDLY HE WAVED A HAND AND THE LACE AT HIS WRIST FELL FORWARD IN A NOT OVERLY CLEAN FRILL LOUIS AFTER THE DEAR KING NO THAT WOULD BE TOO GREAT AN HONOR FOR SO SMALL A BIRD GAUDY THOUGH YOU ARE I THINK
3675-187020-0037 TO THINK THAT I ONCE KNEW SUCH A ROYAL SUCH A DISTINGUISHED MAN HE SIGHED REMINISCENTLY FOR THE FIRST TIME WORDS CAME FROM CLAGGETT CHEW HE BIT THEM OFF AS IF THE SAYING OF THEM COST HIM VERY GREAT EFFORT MORE
3675-187020-0038 EX TINGUISHED THAN DIS TINGUISHED I WOULD SAY
3675-187020-0039 I AM SURE YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED HIM SUCH CHARM
3675-187020-0040 OH DEAR ME YES A MOST UNUSUAL ROYAL PERSONAGE OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY SAID SMILING HAPPILY AT HIS PARAKEET MOST OF THEM ARE SO MUCH ALIKE HE SINGLED OUT SEVERAL FRESH FRUITS PEELING SOME FOR CLAGGETT CHEW
3675-187020-0041 SILENCE FELL OVER THE CABIN EXCEPT FOR OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY'S DELICATELY SMACKING LIPS AS HE FINISHED THE FRUIT AND LICKED HIS FINGERS ONE BY ONE THE INCREASINGLY HEAVY BREATHING OF CLAGGETT CHEW WHO FELL ASLEEP AND THE DISTANT SOUND OF SHOUTS AND CLAMOR FROM THE SHORE
3675-187020-0042 OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY MADE A POUTING FACE AT THE SLEEPING FIGURE OF CHEW EVIDENTLY OSTERBRIDGE WAS BORED HE WENT TO THE DOOR AND CLAPPED HIS HANDS BUT NO ONE RESPONDED EXCEPT FOR THE TWO MEN AND THE PARAKEET THE VULTURE WAS DESERTED
3675-187020-0043 HOLDING A BOTTLE OF WINE WHICH HE UNCORKED AND POURED INTO A GLASS CHRIS FORESEEING WHAT WOULD FOLLOW HOPPED UP TO THE BACK OF HIS NEW MASTER'S CHAIR WHERE HE HOPED HE WOULD BE FORGOTTEN AND TUCKED HIS HEAD UNDER HIS WING IN CASE OSTERBRIDGE SHOULD LOOK AT HIM
