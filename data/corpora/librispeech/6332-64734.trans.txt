6332-64734-0000 ONE FINE SUMMER DAY A MONTH AFTER THESE HER FIRST ADVENTURES DURING WHICH TIME SHE HAD BEEN VERY CAREFULLY WATCHED THE PRINCESS WAS LYING ON THE BED IN THE QUEEN'S OWN CHAMBER FAST ASLEEP ONE OF THE WINDOWS WAS OPEN
6332-64734-0001 FOR IT WAS NOON AND THE DAY WAS SO SULTRY THAT THE LITTLE GIRL WAS WRAPPED IN NOTHING LESS ETHEREAL THAN SLUMBER ITSELF THE QUEEN CAME INTO THE ROOM AND NOT OBSERVING THAT THE BABY WAS ON THE BED OPENED ANOTHER WINDOW
6332-64734-0002 A FROLICSOME FAIRY WIND WHICH HAD BEEN WATCHING FOR A CHANCE OF MISCHIEF RUSHED IN AT THE ONE WINDOW AND TAKING ITS WAY OVER THE BED WHERE THE CHILD WAS LYING CAUGHT HER UP AND ROLLING AND FLOATING HER ALONG
6332-64734-0003 LIKE A PIECE OF FLUE OR A DANDELION SEED CARRIED HER WITH IT THROUGH THE OPPOSITE WINDOW AND AWAY THE QUEEN WENT DOWN STAIRS QUITE IGNORANT OF THE LOSS SHE HAD HERSELF OCCASIONED WHEN THE NURSE RETURNED
6332-64734-0004 SHE SUPPOSED THAT HER MAJESTY HAD CARRIED HER OFF AND DREADING A SCOLDING DELAYED MAKING INQUIRY ABOUT HER BUT HEARING NOTHING SHE GREW UNEASY AND WENT AT LENGTH TO THE QUEEN'S BOUDOIR WHERE SHE FOUND HER MAJESTY
6332-64734-0005 PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY SHALL I TAKE THE BABY SAID SHE WHERE IS SHE ASKED THE QUEEN PLEASE FORGIVE ME I KNOW IT WAS WRONG WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID THE QUEEN LOOKING GRAVE OH DON'T FRIGHTEN ME YOUR MAJESTY EXCLAIMED THE NURSE
6332-64734-0006 CLASPING HER HANDS THE QUEEN SAW THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS AND FELL DOWN IN A FAINT THE NURSE RUSHED ABOUT THE PALACE SCREAMING MY BABY MY BABY EVERY ONE RAN TO THE QUEEN'S ROOM BUT THE QUEEN COULD GIVE NO ORDERS
6332-64734-0007 THEY SOON FOUND OUT HOWEVER THAT THE PRINCESS WAS MISSING AND IN A MOMENT THE PALACE WAS LIKE A BEEHIVE IN A GARDEN AND IN ONE MINUTE MORE THE QUEEN WAS BROUGHT TO HERSELF BY A GREAT SHOUT AND A CLAPPING OF HANDS
6332-64734-0008 THEY HAD FOUND THE PRINCESS FAST ASLEEP UNDER A ROSE BUSH
6332-64734-0009 THERE WAS POSITIVELY NO DANGER OF LETTING HER FALL THEY MIGHT THROW HER DOWN OR KNOCK HER DOWN OR PUSH HER DOWN BUT THEY COULDN'T LET HER DOWN IT IS TRUE THEY MIGHT LET HER FLY INTO THE FIRE OR THE COAL HOLE OR THROUGH THE WINDOW
6332-64734-0010 BUT NONE OF THESE ACCIDENTS HAD HAPPENED AS YET IF YOU HEARD PEALS OF LAUGHTER RESOUNDING FROM SOME UNKNOWN REGION YOU MIGHT BE SURE ENOUGH OF THE CAUSE GOING DOWN INTO THE KITCHEN OR THE ROOM
6332-64734-0011 ALL AND SUM PLAYING AT BALL WITH THE LITTLE PRINCESS SHE WAS THE BALL HERSELF
6332-64734-0012 AWAY SHE WENT FLYING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER SCREECHING WITH LAUGHTER AND THE SERVANTS LOVED THE BALL ITSELF
6332-64734-0013 BUT THEY HAD TO TAKE SOME CARE HOW THEY THREW HER FOR IF SHE RECEIVED AN UPWARD DIRECTION SHE WOULD NEVER COME DOWN AGAIN WITHOUT BEING FETCHED
6332-64734-0014 WHAT IS TO BE DONE BUT ABOVE STAIRS IT WAS DIFFERENT ONE DAY FOR INSTANCE AFTER BREAKFAST THE KING WENT INTO HIS COUNTING HOUSE AND COUNTED OUT HIS MONEY THE OPERATION GAVE HIM NO PLEASURE TO THINK
6332-64734-0015 SAID HE TO HIMSELF THAT EVERY ONE OF THESE GOLD SOVEREIGNS WEIGHS A QUARTER OF AN OUNCE AND MY REAL LIVE FLESH AND BLOOD PRINCESS WEIGHS NOTHING AT ALL AND HE HATED HIS GOLD SOVEREIGNS
6332-64734-0016 AS THEY LAY WITH A BROAD SMILE OF SELF SATISFACTION ALL OVER THEIR YELLOW FACES THE QUEEN WAS IN THE PARLOUR EATING BREAD AND HONEY BUT AT THE SECOND MOUTHFUL SHE BURST OUT CRYING AND COULD NOT SWALLOW IT THE KING HEARD HER SOBBING
6332-64734-0017 GLAD OF ANYBODY BUT ESPECIALLY OF HIS QUEEN TO QUARREL WITH HE CLASHED HIS GOLD SOVEREIGNS INTO HIS MONEY BOX CLAPPED HIS CROWN ON HIS HEAD AND RUSHED INTO THE PARLOUR WHAT IS ALL THIS ABOUT EXCLAIMED HE WHAT ARE YOU CRYING FOR QUEEN
6332-64734-0018 I CAN'T EAT IT SAID THE QUEEN LOOKING RUEFULLY AT THE HONEY POT NO WONDER RETORTED THE KING YOU'VE JUST EATEN YOUR BREAKFAST
6332-64734-0019 OH THAT'S NOT IT SOBBED HER MAJESTY IT'S MY CHILD MY CHILD WELL WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOUR CHILD SHE'S NEITHER UP THE CHIMNEY NOR DOWN THE DRAW WELL JUST HEAR HER LAUGHING YET THE KING COULD NOT HELP A SIGH
6332-64734-0020 WHICH HE TRIED TO TURN INTO A COUGH SAYING IT IS A GOOD THING TO BE LIGHT HEARTED I AM SURE WHETHER SHE BE OURS OR NOT IT IS A BAD THING TO BE LIGHT HEADED ANSWERED THE QUEEN LOOKING WITH PROPHETIC SOUL FAR INTO THE FUTURE
6332-64734-0021 SAID THE KING T IS A BAD THING TO BE LIGHT FINGERED ANSWERED THE QUEEN
6332-64734-0022 SAID THE KING T IS A BAD THING BEGAN THE QUEEN BUT THE KING INTERRUPTED HER
6332-64734-0023 AND IN WHICH THEREFORE HE HAS COME OFF TRIUMPHANT IN FACT IT IS A GOOD THING ALTOGETHER TO BE LIGHT BODIED BUT IT IS A BAD THING ALTOGETHER TO BE LIGHT MINDED RETORTED THE QUEEN WHO WAS BEGINNING TO LOSE HER TEMPER
6332-64734-0024 THIS LAST ANSWER QUITE DISCOMFITED HIS MAJESTY WHO TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND BETOOK HIMSELF TO HIS COUNTING HOUSE AGAIN
6332-64734-0025 THE QUEEN'S HAIR WAS BLACK AS NIGHT AND THE KING'S HAD BEEN AND HIS DAUGHTER'S WAS GOLDEN AS MORNING BUT IT WAS NOT THIS REFLECTION ON HIS HAIR THAT ARRESTED HIM IT WAS THE DOUBLE USE OF THE WORD LIGHT
6332-64734-0026 FOR THE KING HATED ALL WITTICISMS AND PUNNING ESPECIALLY AND BESIDES HE COULD NOT TELL WHETHER THE QUEEN MEANT LIGHT HAIRED OR LIGHT HEIRED FOR WHY MIGHT SHE NOT ASPIRATE HER VOWELS WHEN SHE WAS EXASPERATED HERSELF
6332-64734-0027 HE TURNED UPON HIS OTHER HEEL AND REJOINED HER SHE LOOKED ANGRY STILL BECAUSE SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS GUILTY OR WHAT WAS MUCH THE SAME KNEW THAT HE THOUGHT SO
6332-64734-0028 NOT TO SAY KINGS AND QUEENS AND THE MOST OBJECTIONABLE FORM DUPLICITY CAN ASSUME IS THAT OF PUNNING THERE SAID THE QUEEN I NEVER MADE A JEST BUT I BROKE IT IN THE MAKING I AM THE MOST
6332-64734-0029 UNFORTUNATE WOMAN IN THE WORLD SHE LOOKED SO RUEFUL THAT THE KING TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS AND THEY SAT DOWN TO CONSULT CAN YOU BEAR THIS SAID THE KING NO I CAN'T SAID THE QUEEN
6332-64734-0030 WELL WHAT'S TO BE DONE SAID THE KING I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW SAID THE QUEEN BUT MIGHT YOU NOT TRY AN APOLOGY TO MY OLD SISTER I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN SAID THE KING YES SAID THE QUEEN WELL I DON'T MIND
6332-64734-0031 SAID THE KING SO HE WENT THE NEXT MORNING TO THE HOUSE OF THE PRINCESS AND MAKING A VERY HUMBLE APOLOGY BEGGED HER TO UNDO THE SPELL BUT THE PRINCESS DECLARED WITH A GRAVE FACE THAT SHE KNEW NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT IT HER EYES HOWEVER
6332-64734-0032 SHONE PINK WHICH WAS A SIGN THAT SHE WAS HAPPY SHE ADVISED THE KING AND QUEEN TO HAVE PATIENCE AND TO MEND THEIR WAYS THE KING RETURNED DISCONSOLATE THE QUEEN TRIED TO COMFORT HIM WE WILL WAIT TILL SHE IS OLDER
6332-64734-0033 AND EXPLAIN THINGS TO US BUT WHAT IF SHE SHOULD MARRY EXCLAIMED THE KING IN SUDDEN CONSTERNATION AT THE IDEA WELL WHAT OF THAT REJOINED THE QUEEN JUST THINK IF SHE WERE TO HAVE CHILDREN IN THE COURSE OF A HUNDRED YEARS
6332-64734-0034 THE AIR MIGHT BE AS FULL OF FLOATING CHILDREN AS OF GOSSAMERS IN AUTUMN THAT IS NO BUSINESS OF OURS REPLIED THE QUEEN BESIDES BY THAT TIME THEY WILL HAVE LEARNED TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES A SIGH WAS THE KING'S ONLY ANSWER
6332-64734-0035 HE WOULD HAVE CONSULTED THE COURT PHYSICIANS BUT HE WAS AFRAID THEY WOULD TRY EXPERIMENTS UPON HER
6332-64734-0036 MEANTIME NOTWITHSTANDING AWKWARD OCCURRENCES AND GRIEFS THAT SHE BROUGHT UPON HER PARENTS THE LITTLE PRINCESS LAUGHED AND GREW NOT FAT BUT PLUMP AND TALL
6332-64734-0037 WITHOUT HAVING FALLEN INTO ANY WORSE SCRAPE THAN A CHIMNEY BY RESCUING HER FROM WHICH A LITTLE BIRD NESTING URCHIN GOT FAME AND A BLACK FACE NOR THOUGHTLESS AS SHE WAS
6332-64734-0038 WHEN SHE WAS TOLD FOR THE SAKE OF EXPERIMENT
6332-64734-0039 SHE LAUGHED WHEN SHE HEARD THAT THE ENEMY WAS ON HIS WAY TO BESIEGE HER FATHER'S CAPITAL SHE LAUGHED HUGELY BUT WHEN SHE WAS TOLD THAT THE CITY WOULD CERTAINLY BE ABANDONED TO THE MERCY OF THE ENEMY'S SOLDIERY WHY THEN SHE LAUGHED IMMODERATELY
6332-64734-0040 SHE NEVER COULD BE BROUGHT TO SEE THE SERIOUS SIDE OF ANYTHING WHEN HER MOTHER CRIED SHE SAID WHAT QUEER FACES MAMMA MAKES AND SHE SQUEEZES WATER OUT OF HER CHEEKS FUNNY MAMMA AND WHEN HER PAPA STORMED AT HER
6332-64734-0041 SHE LAUGHED AND DANCED ROUND AND ROUND HIM CLAPPING HER HANDS AND CRYING DO IT AGAIN PAPA DO IT AGAIN IT'S SUCH FUN DEAR FUNNY PAPA AND IF HE TRIED TO CATCH HER SHE GLIDED FROM HIM IN AN INSTANT
6332-64734-0042 NOT IN THE LEAST AFRAID OF HIM BUT THINKING IT PART OF THE GAME NOT TO BE CAUGHT WITH ONE PUSH OF HER FOOT SHE WOULD BE FLOATING IN THE AIR ABOVE HIS HEAD OR SHE WOULD GO DANCING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AND SIDEWAYS LIKE A GREAT BUTTERFLY
6332-64734-0043 IT HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES WHEN HER FATHER AND MOTHER WERE HOLDING A CONSULTATION ABOUT HER IN PRIVATE THAT THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY VAINLY REPRESSED OUTBURSTS OF LAUGHTER OVER THEIR HEADS AND LOOKING UP WITH INDIGNATION
6332-64734-0044 SAW HER FLOATING AT FULL LENGTH IN THE AIR ABOVE THEM WHENCE SHE REGARDED THEM WITH THE MOST COMICAL APPRECIATION OF THE POSITION ONE DAY AN AWKWARD ACCIDENT HAPPENED THE PRINCESS HAD COME OUT UPON THE LAWN WITH ONE OF HER ATTENDANTS
6332-64734-0045 WHO HELD HER BY THE HAND SPYING HER FATHER AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAWN SHE SNATCHED HER HAND FROM THE MAID'S AND SPED ACROSS TO HIM NOW WHEN SHE WANTED TO RUN ALONE
6332-64734-0046 WHATEVER SHE WORE AS PART OF HER ATTIRE HAD NO EFFECT IN THIS WAY
6332-64734-0047 LOST ALL ITS WEIGHT FOR THE TIME BUT WHATEVER SHE ONLY HELD IN HER HANDS RETAINED ITS DOWNWARD TENDENCY ON THIS OCCASION SHE COULD SEE NOTHING TO CATCH UP BUT A HUGE TOAD THAT WAS WALKING ACROSS THE LAWN
6332-64734-0048 AS IF HE HAD A HUNDRED YEARS TO DO IT IN NOT KNOWING WHAT DISGUST MEANT FOR THIS WAS ONE OF HER PECULIARITIES SHE SNATCHED UP THE TOAD AND BOUNDED AWAY SHE HAD ALMOST REACHED HER FATHER AND HE WAS HOLDING OUT HIS ARMS TO RECEIVE HER
6332-64734-0049 AND TAKE FROM HER LIPS THE KISS WHICH HOVERED ON THEM LIKE A BUTTERFLY ON A ROSEBUD WHEN A PUFF OF WIND BLEW HER ASIDE INTO THE ARMS OF A YOUNG PAGE WHO HAD JUST BEEN RECEIVING A MESSAGE FROM HIS MAJESTY
6332-64734-0050 NOW IT WAS NO GREAT PECULIARITY IN THE PRINCESS THAT ONCE SHE WAS SET AGOING IT ALWAYS COST HER TIME AND TROUBLE TO CHECK HERSELF ON THIS OCCASION THERE WAS NO TIME SHE MUST KISS AND SHE KISSED THE PAGE SHE DID NOT MIND IT MUCH
6332-64734-0051 FOR SHE HAD NO SHYNESS IN HER COMPOSITION AND SHE KNEW BESIDES THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP IT SO SHE ONLY LAUGHED LIKE A MUSICAL BOX THE POOR PAGE FARED THE WORST FOR THE PRINCESS TRYING TO CORRECT THE UNFORTUNATE TENDENCY OF THE KISS
6332-64734-0052 PUT OUT HER HANDS TO KEEP OFF THE PAGE SO THAT ALONG WITH THE KISS HE RECEIVED ON THE OTHER CHEEK A SLAP WITH THE HUGE BLACK TOAD WHICH SHE POKED RIGHT INTO HIS EYE HE TRIED TO LAUGH TOO
6332-64734-0053 BUT THE ATTEMPT RESULTED IN SUCH AN ODD CONTORTION OF COUNTENANCE AS SHOWED THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER OF HIS PLUMING HIMSELF ON THE KISS AS FOR THE KING HIS DIGNITY WAS GREATLY HURT
6332-64734-0054 AND HE DID NOT SPEAK TO THE PAGE FOR A WHOLE MONTH I MAY HERE REMARK THAT IT WAS VERY AMUSING TO SEE HER RUN IF HER MODE OF PROGRESSION COULD PROPERLY BE CALLED RUNNING
