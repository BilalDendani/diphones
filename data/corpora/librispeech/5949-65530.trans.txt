5949-65530-0000 BETWEEN THE HILL AND THE VALLEY IT WAS ONE OF THE MOIST PLEASANTLY ODOROUS NIGHTS OF EARLY SPRING THERE WAS A CHILL IN THE EVENING AIR BUT THE GRASS WAS GROWING GREEN IN SHELTERED SPOTS
5949-65530-0001 AND JEFFREY MILLER HAD FOUND PURPLE PETALLED VIOLETS AND PINK ARBUTUS ON THE HILL THAT DAY ACROSS A VALLEY FILLED WITH BEECH AND FIR THERE WAS A SUNSET AFTERGLOW CREAMY YELLOW AND PALE RED WITH A NEW MOON SWUNG ABOVE IT
5949-65530-0002 IT WAS A NIGHT FOR A MAN TO WALK ALONE AND DREAM OF HIS LOVE WHICH WAS PERHAPS WHY JEFFREY MILLER CAME SO LOITERINGLY ACROSS THE SPRINGY HILL PASTURE WITH HIS HANDS FULL OF THE MAYFLOWERS HE WAS A TALL BROAD SHOULDERED MAN OF FORTY
5949-65530-0003 AND LOOKING NO YOUNGER WITH DARK GREY EYES AND A TANNED CLEAN CUT FACE CLEAN SHAVEN SAVE FOR A DROOPING MOUSTACHE JEFFREY MILLER WAS CONSIDERED A HANDSOME MAN
5949-65530-0004 AND BAYSIDE PEOPLE HAD PERIODICAL FITS OF WONDERING WHY HE HAD NEVER MARRIED THEY PITIED HIM FOR THE LONELY LIFE HE MUST LEAD ALONE THERE AT THE VALLEY FARM WITH ONLY A DEAF OLD HOUSEKEEPER AS A COMPANION
5949-65530-0005 FOR IT DID NOT OCCUR TO THE BAYSIDE PEOPLE IN GENERAL THAT A COUPLE OF SHAGGY DOGS COULD BE CALLED COMPANIONS AND THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT BOOKS MAKE VERY EXCELLENT COMRADES FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO TREAT THEM ONE OF JEFFREY'S DOGS WAS WITH HIM NOW
5949-65530-0006 THE OLDEST ONE WITH WHITE BREAST AND PAWS AND A TAWNY COAT HE WAS SO OLD THAT HE WAS HALF BLIND AND RATHER DEAF BUT WITH ONE EXCEPTION HE WAS THE DEAREST OF LIVING CREATURES TO JEFFREY MILLER
5949-65530-0007 FOR SARA STUART HAD GIVEN HIM THE SPRAWLY CHUBBY LITTLE PUP YEARS AGO THEY CAME DOWN THE HILL TOGETHER A GROUP OF MEN WERE STANDING ON THE BRIDGE IN THE HOLLOW DISCUSSING COLONEL STUART'S FUNERAL OF THE DAY BEFORE
5949-65530-0008 JEFFREY CAUGHT SARA'S NAME AND PAUSED ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE GROUP TO LISTEN SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE WERE LYING DEAD UNDER SIX FEET OF TURF AND SARA STUART'S NAME WERE PRONOUNCED ABOVE HIM HIS HEART WOULD GIVE A BOUND OF LIFE
5949-65530-0009 YES THE OLD KUNNEL'S GONE AT LAST CHRISTOPHER JACKSON WAS SAYING HE TOOK HIS TIME DYIN THAT'S SARTAIN MUST BE A KIND OF RELIEF FOR SARA SHE'S HAD TO WAIT ON HIM HAND AND FOOT FOR YEARS BUT NO DOUBT SHE'LL FEEL PRETTY LONESOME
5949-65530-0010 WONDER WHAT SHE'LL DO IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON FOR HER TO DO ANYTHING ASKED ALEC CHURCHILL
5949-65530-0011 THERE WERE EXCLAMATIONS OF SURPRISE FROM THE OTHER MEN ON HEARING THIS JEFFREY DREW NEARER ABSENTLY PATTING HIS DOG'S HEAD HE HAD NOT KNOWN IT EITHER OH YES
5949-65530-0012 SAID CHRISTOPHER ENJOYING ALL THE IMPORTANCE OF EXCLUSIVE INFORMATION I THOUGHT EVERYBODY KNEW THAT PINEHURST GOES TO THE OLDEST MALE HEIR THE OLD KUNNEL FELT IT KEEN THAT HE HADN'T A SON OF COURSE THERE'S PLENTY OF MONEY AND SARA'LL GET THAT
5949-65530-0013 BUT I GUESS SHE'LL FEEL PRETTY BAD AT LEAVING HER OLD HOME SARA AIN'T AS YOUNG AS SHE USED TO BE NEITHER LET ME SEE SHE MUST BE THIRTY EIGHT WELL SHE'S LEFT PRETTY LONESOME

5949-65530-0016 JEFFREY SWUNG OUT OF THE GROUP AND STARTED HOMEWARD WITH HIS DOG TO STAND BY AND HEAR SARA STUART DISCUSSED AFTER THIS FASHION WAS MORE THAN HE COULD ENDURE THE MEN IDLY WATCHED HIS TALL ERECT FIGURE AS HE WENT ALONG THE VALLEY
5949-65530-0017 QUEER CHAP JEFF SAID ALEC CHURCHILL REFLECTIVELY JEFF'S ALL RIGHT SAID CHRISTOPHER IN A PATRONIZING WAY THERE AIN'T A BETTER MAN OR NEIGHBOUR ALIVE
5949-65530-0018 BUT HE'S QUEER SARTAINLY NOT LIKE OTHER PEOPLE KIND OF UNSOCIABLE HE DON'T CARE FOR A THING CEPT DOGS AND READING AND MOONING ROUND WOODS AND FIELDS THAT AIN'T NATURAL YOU KNOW BUT I MUST SAY HE'S A GOOD FARMER
5949-65530-0019 HE'S GOT THE BEST FARM IN BAYSIDE AND THAT'S A REAL NICE HOUSE HE PUT UP ON IT AIN'T IT AN ODD THING HE NEVER MARRIED NEVER SEEMED TO HAVE NO NOTION OF IT I CAN'T RECOLLECT OF JEFF MILLER'S EVER COURTING ANYBODY THAT'S ANOTHER UNNATURAL THING ABOUT HIM
5949-65530-0020 I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT JEFF THOUGHT HIMSELF A CUT OR TWO ABOVE THE REST OF US SAID TOM SCOVEL WITH A SNEER MAYBE HE THINKS THE BAYSIDE GIRLS AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM
5949-65530-0021 THERE AIN'T NO SUCH DIRTY PRIDE ABOUT JEFF PRONOUNCED CHRISTOPHER CONCLUSIVELY AND THE MILLERS ARE THE BEST FAMILY HEREABOUTS LEAVING THE KUNNEL'S OUT AND JEFF'S WELL OFF
5949-65530-0022 NOBODY KNOWS HOW WELL I RECKON BUT I CAN GUESS BEING HIS LAND NEIGHBOUR JEFF AIN'T NO FOOL NOR LOAFER IF HE IS A BIT QUEER MEANWHILE THE OBJECT OF THESE REMARKS WAS STRIDING HOMEWARD AND THINKING NOT OF THE MEN BEHIND HIM
5949-65530-0023 BUT OF SARA STUART HE MUST GO TO HER AT ONCE HE HAD NOT INTRUDED ON HER SINCE HER FATHER'S DEATH THINKING HER SORROW TOO GREAT FOR HIM TO MEDDLE WITH BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT PERHAPS SHE NEEDED THE ADVICE OR ASSISTANCE ONLY HE COULD GIVE
5949-65530-0024 TO WHOM ELSE IN BAYSIDE COULD SHE TURN FOR IT BUT TO HIM HER OLD FRIEND WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT SHE MUST LEAVE PINEHURST THE THOUGHT STRUCK COLD DISMAY TO HIS SOUL HOW COULD HE BEAR HIS LIFE IF SHE WENT AWAY
5949-65530-0025 HE HAD LOVED SARA STUART FROM CHILDHOOD HE REMEMBERED VIVIDLY THE DAY HE HAD FIRST SEEN HER A SPRING DAY MUCH LIKE THIS ONE HAD BEEN HE A BOY OF EIGHT HAD GONE WITH HIS FATHER TO THE BIG SUNSHINY HILL FIELD
5949-65530-0026 AND HE HAD SEARCHED FOR BIRDS NESTS IN THE LITTLE FIR COPSES ALONG THE CREST WHILE HIS FATHER PLOWED HE HAD SO COME UPON HER SITTING ON THE FENCE UNDER THE PINES AT THE BACK OF PINEHURST A CHILD OF SIX IN A DRESS OF PURPLE CLOTH
5949-65530-0027 HER LONG LIGHT BROWN CURLS FELL OVER HER SHOULDERS AND RIPPLED SLEEKLY BACK FROM HER CALM LITTLE BROW HER EYES WERE LARGE AND GREYISH BLUE STRAIGHT GAZING AND STEADFAST
5949-65530-0028 TO THE END OF HIS LIFE THE BOY WAS TO CARRY IN HIS HEART THE PICTURE SHE MADE THERE UNDER THE PINES LITTLE BOY SHE HAD SAID WITH A FRIENDLY SMILE
5949-65530-0029 AND THEY SET OUT TOGETHER FOR THE BARRENS BEYOND THE FIELD WHERE THE ARBUTUS TRAILED ITS STARS OF SWEETNESS UNDER THE DUSTY DEAD GRASSES AND WITHERED LEAVES OF THE OLD YEAR THE BOY WAS THRILLED WITH DELIGHT SHE WAS A FAIRY QUEEN WHO THUS GRACIOUSLY SMILED ON HIM
5949-65530-0030 AND CHATTERED BLITHELY AS THEY SEARCHED FOR MAYFLOWERS IN THE FRESH SPRING SUNSHINE HE THOUGHT IT A WONDERFUL THING THAT IT HAD SO CHANCED IT OVERJOYED HIM TO GIVE THE CHOICEST DUSTERS HE FOUND INTO HER SLIM WAXEN LITTLE FINGERS
5949-65530-0031 AND WATCH HER EYES GROW ROUND WITH PLEASURE IN THEM WHEN THE SUN BEGAN TO LOWER OVER THE BEECHES SHE HAD GONE HOME WITH HER ARMS FULL OF ARBUTUS BUT SHE HAD TURNED AT THE EDGE OF THE PINELAND AND WAVED HER HAND AT HIM THAT NIGHT
5949-65530-0032 WHEN HE TOLD HIS MOTHER OF THE LITTLE GIRL HE HAD MET ON THE HILL SHE HAD HOPED ANXIOUSLY THAT HE HAD BEEN VERY POLITE FOR THE LITTLE GIRL WAS A DAUGHTER OF COLONEL STUART NEWLY COME TO PINEHURST JEFFREY REFLECTING
5949-65530-0033 HAD NOT BEEN CERTAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN POLITE BUT I AM SURE SHE LIKED ME HE SAID GRAVELY A FEW DAYS LATER A MESSAGE CAME FROM MISSUS STUART ON THE HILL TO MISSUS MILLER IN THE VALLEY
5949-65530-0034 WOULD SHE LET HER LITTLE BOY GO UP NOW AND THEN TO PLAY WITH SARA SARA WAS VERY LONELY BECAUSE SHE HAD NO PLAYMATES SO JEFF OVERJOYED HAD GONE TO HIS DIVINITY'S VERY HOME WHERE THE TWO CHILDREN PLAYED TOGETHER MANY A DAY
5949-65530-0035 ALL THROUGH THEIR CHILDHOOD THEY HAD BEEN FAST FRIENDS SARA'S PARENTS PLACED NO BAR TO THEIR INTIMACY THEY HAD SOON CONCLUDED THAT LITTLE JEFF MILLER WAS A VERY GOOD PLAYMATE FOR SARA HE WAS GENTLE WELL BEHAVED AND MANLY
5949-65530-0036 SARA NEVER WENT TO THE DISTRICT SCHOOL WHICH JEFF ATTENDED SHE HAD HER GOVERNESS AT HOME WITH NO OTHER BOY OR GIRL IN BAYSIDE DID SHE FORM ANY FRIENDSHIP BUT HER LOYALTY TO JEFF NEVER WAVERED AS FOR JEFF
5949-65530-0037 HE WORSHIPPED HER AND WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING SHE COMMANDED HE BELONGED TO HER FROM THE DAY THEY HAD HUNTED ARBUTUS ON THE HILL WHEN SARA WAS FIFTEEN SHE HAD GONE AWAY TO SCHOOL JEFF HAD MISSED HER SORELY
5949-65530-0038 FOR FOUR YEARS HE SAW HER ONLY IN THE SUMMERS AND EACH YEAR SHE HAD SEEMED TALLER STATELIER FURTHER FROM HIM WHEN SHE GRADUATED HER FATHER TOOK HER ABROAD FOR TWO YEARS THEN SHE CAME HOME A LOVELY HIGH BRED GIRL
5949-65530-0039 AND JEFFREY MILLER WAS FACE TO FACE WITH TWO BITTER FACTS ONE WAS THAT HE LOVED HER NOT WITH THE BOY AND GIRL LOVE OF LONG AGO BUT WITH THE LOVE OF A MAN FOR THE ONE WOMAN IN THE WORLD
5949-65530-0040 AND THE OTHER WAS THAT SHE WAS AS FAR BEYOND HIS REACH AS ONE OF THOSE SUNSET STARS OF WHICH SHE HAD ALWAYS REMINDED HIM IN HER PURE CLEAR SHINING LOVELINESS HE LOOKED THESE FACTS UNFLINCHINGLY IN THE FACE UNTIL HE HAD GROWN USED TO THEM
5949-65530-0041 AND THEN HE LAID DOWN HIS COURSE FOR HIMSELF HE LOVED SARA AND HE DID NOT WISH TO CONQUER HIS LOVE EVEN IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE IT WERE BETTER TO LOVE HER WHOM HE COULD NEVER WIN THAN TO LOVE AND BE LOVED BY ANY OTHER WOMAN
5949-65530-0042 HIS GREAT OFFICE IN LIFE WAS TO BE HER FRIEND HUMBLE AND UNEXPECTANT TO BE AT HAND IF SHE SHOULD NEED HIM FOR EVER SO TRIFLING A SERVICE NEVER TO PRESUME ALWAYS TO BE FAITHFUL
5949-65530-0043 SARA HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HER OLD FRIEND BUT THEIR FORMER COMRADESHIP WAS NOW IMPOSSIBLE THEY COULD BE FRIENDS BUT NEVER AGAIN COMPANIONS SARA'S LIFE WAS FULL AND GAY
5949-65530-0044 SHE HAD INTERESTS IN WHICH HE HAD NO SHARE HER SOCIAL WORLD WAS UTTERLY APART FROM HIS SHE WAS OF THE HILL AND ITS TRADITIONS HE WAS OF THE VALLEY AND ITS PEOPLE THE DEMOCRACY OF CHILDHOOD PAST
5949-65530-0045 THERE WAS NO COMMON GROUND ON WHICH THEY MIGHT MEET ONLY ONE THING JEFFREY HAD FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTEMPLATE CALMLY SOME DAY SARA WOULD MARRY A MAN WHO WAS HER EQUAL WHO SAT AT HER FATHER'S TABLE AS A GUEST
5949-65530-0046 IN SPITE OF HIMSELF JEFFREY'S HEART FILLED WITH HOT REBELLION AT THE THOUGHT
