25-123319-0000 A MODEST PROPOSAL FOR PREVENTING THE CHILDREN OF POOR PEOPLE IN IRELAND
25-123319-0001 SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE IT IS A MELANCHOLY OBJECT TO THOSE WHO WALK THROUGH THIS GREAT TOWN OR TRAVEL IN THE COUNTRY WHEN THEY SEE THE STREETS THE ROADS AND CABBIN DOORS
25-123319-0002 THESE MOTHERS INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO WORK FOR THEIR HONEST LIVELIHOOD ARE FORCED TO EMPLOY ALL THEIR TIME IN STROLING TO BEG SUSTENANCE FOR THEIR HELPLESS INFANTS WHO
25-123319-0003 TO FIGHT FOR THE PRETENDER IN SPAIN OR SELL THEMSELVES TO THE BARBADOES
25-123319-0004 A VERY GREAT ADDITIONAL GRIEVANCE AND THEREFORE WHOEVER COULD FIND OUT A FAIR CHEAP AND EASY METHOD OF MAKING THESE CHILDREN
25-123319-0005 IT IS OF A MUCH GREATER EXTENT
25-123319-0006 AT A CERTAIN AGE WHO ARE BORN OF PARENTS IN EFFECT AS LITTLE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM AS THOSE WHO DEMAND OUR CHARITY IN THE STREETS AS TO MY OWN PART HAVING TURNED MY THOUGHTS FOR MANY YEARS UPON THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT
25-123319-0007 I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THEM GROSSLY MISTAKEN IN THEIR COMPUTATION IT IS TRUE A CHILD JUST DROPT FROM ITS DAM MAY BE SUPPORTED BY HER MILK FOR A SOLAR YEAR WITH LITTLE OTHER NOURISHMENT
25-123319-0008 WHICH THE MOTHER MAY CERTAINLY GET OR THE VALUE IN SCRAPS BY HER LAWFUL OCCUPATION OF BEGGING AND IT IS EXACTLY AT ONE YEAR OLD THAT I PROPOSE TO PROVIDE FOR THEM
25-123319-0009 IN SUCH A MANNER AS INSTEAD OF BEING A CHARGE UPON THEIR PARENTS OR THE PARISH
25-123319-0010 THEY SHALL ON THE CONTRARY CONTRIBUTE TO THE FEEDING AND PARTLY TO THE CLOATHING OF MANY THOUSANDS THERE IS LIKEWISE ANOTHER GREAT ADVANTAGE IN MY SCHEME
25-123319-0011 THAT IT WILL PREVENT THOSE VOLUNTARY ABORTIONS AND THAT HORRID PRACTICE OF WOMEN MURDERING THEIR BASTARD CHILDREN ALAS TOO FREQUENT AMONG US
25-123319-0012 SACRIFICING THE POOR INNOCENT BABES I DOUBT MORE TO AVOID THE EXPENCE THAN THE SHAME WHICH WOULD MOVE TEARS AND PITY IN THE MOST SAVAGE AND INHUMAN BREAST
25-123319-0013 THE NUMBER OF SOULS IN THIS KINGDOM BEING USUALLY RECKONED ONE MILLION AND A HALF OF THESE I CALCULATE THERE MAY BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND COUPLE WHOSE WIVES ARE BREEDERS
25-123319-0014 WHO ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN CHILDREN ALTHOUGH I APPREHEND THERE CANNOT BE SO MANY UNDER THE PRESENT DISTRESSES OF THE KINGDOM BUT THIS BEING GRANTED THERE WILL REMAIN
25-123319-0015 AN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND BREEDERS I AGAIN SUBTRACT FIFTY THOUSAND FOR THOSE WOMEN WHO MISCARRY OR WHOSE CHILDREN DIE BY ACCIDENT OR DISEASE WITHIN THE YEAR
25-123319-0016 THE QUESTION THEREFORE IS HOW THIS NUMBER SHALL BE REARED AND PROVIDED FOR WHICH AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID UNDER THE PRESENT SITUATION OF AFFAIRS IS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE BY ALL THE METHODS HITHERTO PROPOSED
25-123319-0017 FOR WE CAN NEITHER EMPLOY THEM IN HANDICRAFT OR AGRICULTURE WE NEITHER BUILD HOUSES I MEAN IN THE COUNTRY NOR CULTIVATE LAND THEY CAN VERY SELDOM PICK UP A LIVELIHOOD BY STEALING TILL THEY ARRIVE AT SIX YEARS OLD
25-123319-0018 EXCEPT WHERE THEY ARE OF TOWARDLY PARTS ALTHOUGH I CONFESS THEY LEARN THE RUDIMENTS MUCH EARLIER DURING WHICH TIME THEY CAN HOWEVER BE PROPERLY LOOKED UPON ONLY AS PROBATIONERS
25-123319-0019 WHO PROTESTED TO ME THAT HE NEVER KNEW ABOVE ONE OR TWO INSTANCES UNDER THE AGE OF SIX EVEN IN A PART OF THE KINGDOM SO RENOWNED FOR THE QUICKEST PROFICIENCY IN THAT ART
25-123319-0020 I HAVE BEEN ASSURED BY A VERY KNOWING AMERICAN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE IN LONDON THAT A YOUNG HEALTHY CHILD WELL NURSED IS AT A YEAR OLD A MOST DELICIOUS
25-123319-0021 NOURISHING AND WHOLESOME FOOD WHETHER STEWED ROASTED BAKED OR BOILED AND I MAKE NO DOUBT THAT IT WILL EQUALLY SERVE IN A FRICASIE OR A RAGOUST
25-123319-0022 I DO THEREFORE HUMBLY OFFER IT TO PUBLICK CONSIDERATION THAT OF THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND CHILDREN ALREADY COMPUTED TWENTY THOUSAND MAY BE RESERVED FOR BREED WHEREOF ONLY ONE FOURTH PART TO BE MALES
25-123319-0023 BLACK CATTLE OR SWINE AND MY REASON IS THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE SELDOM THE FRUITS OF MARRIAGE A CIRCUMSTANCE NOT MUCH REGARDED BY OUR SAVAGES THEREFORE ONE MALE WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SERVE FOUR FEMALES
25-123319-0024 AND WHEN THE FAMILY DINES ALONE THE FORE OR HIND QUARTER WILL MAKE A REASONABLE DISH AND SEASONED WITH A LITTLE PEPPER OR SALT WILL BE VERY GOOD BOILED ON THE FOURTH DAY ESPECIALLY IN WINTER
25-123319-0025 I HAVE RECKONED UPON A MEDIUM THAT A CHILD JUST BORN WILL WEIGH TWELVE POUNDS AND IN A SOLAR YEAR IF TOLERABLY NURSED ENCREASETH TO TWENTY EIGHT POUNDS
25-123319-0026 I GRANT THIS FOOD WILL BE SOMEWHAT DEAR AND THEREFORE VERY PROPER FOR LANDLORDS WHO AS THEY HAVE ALREADY DEVOURED MOST OF THE PARENTS SEEM TO HAVE THE BEST TITLE TO THE CHILDREN INFANT'S FLESH WILL BE IN SEASON THROUGHOUT THE YEAR
25-123319-0027 BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF POPISH INFANTS IS AT LEAST THREE TO ONE IN THIS KINGDOM AND THEREFORE IT WILL HAVE ONE OTHER COLLATERAL ADVANTAGE BY LESSENING THE NUMBER OF PAPISTS AMONG US
25-123319-0028 I HAVE ALREADY COMPUTED THE CHARGE OF NURSING A BEGGAR'S CHILD
25-123319-0029 TO BE ABOUT TWO SHILLINGS PER ANNUM RAGS INCLUDED
25-123319-0030 FOR THE CARCASS OF A GOOD FAT CHILD WHICH AS I HAVE SAID WILL MAKE FOUR DISHES OF EXCELLENT NUTRITIVE MEAT WHEN HE HATH ONLY SOME PARTICULAR FRIEND OR HIS OWN FAMILY TO DINE WITH HIM THUS THE SQUIRE WILL LEARN TO BE A GOOD LANDLORD
25-123319-0031 AND GROW POPULAR AMONG HIS TENANTS THE MOTHER WILL HAVE EIGHT SHILLINGS NEAT PROFIT AND BE FIT FOR WORK TILL SHE PRODUCES ANOTHER CHILD THOSE WHO ARE MORE THRIFTY AS I MUST CONFESS THE TIMES REQUIRE
25-123319-0032 AS TO OUR CITY OF DUBLIN SHAMBLES MAY BE APPOINTED FOR THIS PURPOSE IN THE MOST CONVENIENT PARTS OF IT AND BUTCHERS WE MAY BE ASSURED WILL NOT BE WANTING ALTHOUGH I RATHER RECOMMEND
25-123319-0033 BUYING THE CHILDREN ALIVE AND DRESSING THEM HOT FROM THE KNIFE AS WE DO ROASTING PIGS A VERY WORTHY PERSON
25-123319-0034 A TRUE LOVER OF HIS COUNTRY AND WHOSE VIRTUES I HIGHLY ESTEEM WAS LATELY PLEASED IN DISCOURSING ON THIS MATTER TO OFFER A REFINEMENT UPON MY SCHEME HE SAID THAT MANY GENTLEMEN OF THIS KINGDOM
25-123319-0035 NOT EXCEEDING FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOR UNDER TWELVE SO GREAT A NUMBER OF BOTH SEXES IN EVERY COUNTRY BEING NOW READY TO STARVE FOR WANT OF WORK AND SERVICE AND THESE TO BE DISPOSED OF BY THEIR PARENTS IF ALIVE
25-123319-0036 FOR AS TO THE MALES MY AMERICAN ACQUAINTANCE ASSURED ME FROM FREQUENT EXPERIENCE THAT THEIR FLESH WAS GENERALLY TOUGH AND LEAN LIKE THAT OF OUR SCHOOL BOYS BY CONTINUAL EXERCISE AND THEIR TASTE DISAGREEABLE
25-123319-0037 AND TO FATTEN THEM WOULD NOT ANSWER THE CHARGE
25-123319-0038 BUT IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY MY FRIEND HE CONFESSED THAT THIS EXPEDIENT WAS PUT INTO HIS HEAD BY THE FAMOUS SALMANAAZOR A NATIVE OF THE ISLAND FORMOSA
25-123319-0039 WHO CAME FROM THENCE TO LONDON ABOVE TWENTY YEARS AGO AND IN CONVERSATION TOLD MY FRIEND THAT IN HIS COUNTRY WHEN ANY YOUNG PERSON HAPPENED TO BE PUT TO DEATH THE EXECUTIONER SOLD THE CARCASS TO PERSONS OF QUALITY AS A PRIME DAINTY
25-123319-0040 AND THAT IN HIS TIME THE BODY OF A PLUMP GIRL OF FIFTEEN WHO WAS CRUCIFIED FOR AN ATTEMPT TO POISON THE EMPEROR WAS SOLD TO HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY'S PRIME MINISTER OF STATE AND OTHER GREAT MANDARINS OF THE COURT
25-123319-0041 CANNOT STIR ABROAD WITHOUT A CHAIR
25-123319-0042 AND I HAVE BEEN DESIRED TO EMPLOY MY THOUGHTS WHAT COURSE MAY BE TAKEN TO EASE THE NATION OF SO GRIEVOUS AN INCUMBRANCE BUT I AM NOT IN THE LEAST PAIN UPON THAT MATTER
25-123319-0043 BECAUSE IT IS VERY WELL KNOWN THAT THEY ARE EVERY DAY DYING AND ROTTING BY COLD AND FAMINE AND FILTH AND VERMIN
25-123319-0044 THEY CANNOT GET WORK AND CONSEQUENTLY PINE AWAY FROM WANT OF NOURISHMENT
25-123319-0045 THEY HAVE NOT STRENGTH TO PERFORM IT AND THUS THE COUNTRY AND THEMSELVES ARE HAPPILY DELIVERED FROM THE EVILS TO COME I HAVE TOO LONG DIGRESSED AND THEREFORE SHALL RETURN TO MY SUBJECT
25-123319-0046 I THINK THE ADVANTAGES BY THE PROPOSAL WHICH I HAVE MADE ARE OBVIOUS AND MANY AS WELL AS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE FOR FIRST AS I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED
25-123319-0047 IT WOULD GREATLY LESSEN THE NUMBER OF PAPISTS WITH WHOM WE ARE YEARLY OVER RUN BEING THE PRINCIPAL BREEDERS OF THE NATION AS WELL AS OUR MOST DANGEROUS ENEMIES AND WHO
25-123319-0048 STAY AT HOME ON PURPOSE WITH A DESIGN TO DELIVER THE KINGDOM TO THE PRETENDER HOPING TO TAKE THEIR ADVANTAGE BY THE ABSENCE OF SO MANY GOOD PROTESTANTS WHO HAVE CHOSEN RATHER TO LEAVE THEIR COUNTRY THAN STAY AT HOME AND PAY TITHES
25-123319-0049 AGAINST THEIR CONSCIENCE TO AN EPISCOPAL CURATE SECONDLY THE POORER TENANTS WILL HAVE SOMETHING VALUABLE OF THEIR OWN WHICH BY LAW
25-123319-0050 THEIR CORN AND CATTLE BEING ALREADY SEIZED AND MONEY A THING UNKNOWN THIRDLY WHEREAS THE MAINTAINANCE OF AN HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN FROM TWO YEARS OLD AND UPWARDS CANNOT BE COMPUTED AT LESS THAN TEN SHILLINGS A PIECE PER ANNUM
25-123319-0051 BESIDES THE PROFIT OF A NEW DISH INTRODUCED TO THE TABLES OF ALL GENTLEMEN OF FORTUNE IN THE KINGDOM WHO HAVE ANY REFINEMENT IN TASTE AND THE MONEY WILL CIRCULATE AMONG OUR SELVES THE GOODS BEING ENTIRELY OF OUR OWN GROWTH AND MANUFACTURE
25-123319-0052 THIS FOOD WOULD LIKEWISE BRING GREAT CUSTOM TO TAVERNS WHERE THE VINTNERS WILL CERTAINLY BE SO PRUDENT AS TO PROCURE THE BEST RECEIPTS FOR DRESSING IT TO PERFECTION AND CONSEQUENTLY HAVE THEIR HOUSES FREQUENTED BY ALL THE FINE GENTLEMEN
25-123319-0053 WHO JUSTLY VALUE THEMSELVES UPON THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN GOOD EATING AND A SKILFUL COOK WHO UNDERSTANDS HOW TO OBLIGE HIS GUESTS WILL CONTRIVE TO MAKE IT AS EXPENSIVE AS THEY PLEASE SIXTHLY
25-123319-0054 THIS WOULD BE A GREAT INDUCEMENT TO MARRIAGE WHICH ALL WISE NATIONS HAVE EITHER ENCOURAGED BY REWARDS OR ENFORCED BY LAWS AND PENALTIES IT WOULD ENCREASE THE CARE AND TENDERNESS OF MOTHERS TOWARDS THEIR CHILDREN
25-123319-0055 WHICH OF THEM COULD BRING THE FATTEST CHILD TO THE MARKET MEN WOULD BECOME AS FOND OF THEIR WIVES DURING THE TIME OF THEIR PREGNANCY AS THEY ARE NOW OF THEIR MARES IN FOAL THEIR COWS IN CALF
25-123319-0056 NOR OFFER TO BEAT OR KICK THEM AS IS TOO FREQUENT A PRACTICE FOR FEAR OF A MISCARRIAGE MANY OTHER ADVANTAGES MIGHT BE ENUMERATED FOR INSTANCE
25-123319-0057 THE PROPAGATION OF SWINE'S FLESH AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE ART OF MAKING GOOD BACON SO MUCH WANTED AMONG US BY THE GREAT DESTRUCTION OF PIGS TOO FREQUENT AT OUR TABLES
25-123319-0058 WHICH ROASTED WHOLE WILL MAKE A CONSIDERABLE FIGURE AT A LORD MAYOR'S FEAST
25-123319-0059 BUT THIS AND MANY OTHERS I OMIT BEING STUDIOUS OF BREVITY SUPPOSING THAT ONE THOUSAND FAMILIES IN THIS CITY WOULD BE CONSTANT CUSTOMERS FOR INFANTS FLESH BESIDES
25-123319-0060 OTHERS WHO MIGHT HAVE IT AT MERRY MEETINGS PARTICULARLY AT WEDDINGS AND CHRISTENINGS I COMPUTE THAT DUBLIN WOULD TAKE OFF ANNUALLY ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND CARCASSES
25-123319-0061 AND THE REST OF THE KINGDOM WHERE PROBABLY THEY WILL BE SOLD SOMEWHAT CHEAPER THE REMAINING EIGHTY THOUSAND
25-123319-0062 THIS I FREELY OWN AND TWAS INDEED ONE PRINCIPAL DESIGN IN OFFERING IT TO THE WORLD I DESIRE THE READER WILL OBSERVE THAT I CALCULATE MY REMEDY FOR THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL KINGDOM OF IRELAND
25-123319-0063 AND FOR NO OTHER THAT EVER WAS IS OR I THINK EVER CAN BE UPON EARTH THEREFORE LET NO MAN TALK TO ME OF OTHER EXPEDIENTS
25-123319-0064 OF UTTERLY REJECTING THE MATERIALS AND INSTRUMENTS THAT PROMOTE FOREIGN LUXURY
25-123319-0065 VANITY IDLENESS AND GAMING IN OUR WOMEN OF INTRODUCING A VEIN OF PARSIMONY PRUDENCE AND TEMPERANCE OF LEARNING TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY WHEREIN WE DIFFER EVEN FROM LAPLANDERS AND THE INHABITANTS OF
25-123319-0066 OF BEING A LITTLE CAUTIOUS NOT TO SELL OUR COUNTRY AND CONSCIENCES FOR NOTHING
25-123319-0067 LASTLY OF PUTTING A SPIRIT OF HONESTY INDUSTRY AND SKILL INTO OUR SHOP KEEPERS WHO
25-123319-0068 THE MEASURE AND THE GOODNESS NOR COULD EVER YET BE BROUGHT TO MAKE ONE FAIR PROPOSAL OF JUST DEALING THOUGH OFTEN AND EARNESTLY INVITED TO IT THEREFORE I REPEAT
25-123319-0069 LET NO MAN TALK TO ME OF THESE AND THE LIKE EXPEDIENTS TILL HE HATH AT LEAST SOME GLYMPSE OF HOPE THAT THERE WILL EVER BE SOME HEARTY AND SINCERE ATTEMPT TO PUT THEM INTO PRACTICE BUT
25-123319-0070 AS TO MY SELF HAVING BEEN WEARIED OUT FOR MANY YEARS WITH OFFERING VAIN IDLE VISIONARY THOUGHTS AND AT LENGTH UTTERLY DESPAIRING OF SUCCESS I FORTUNATELY FELL UPON THIS PROPOSAL WHICH AS IT IS WHOLLY NEW
25-123319-0071 FULL IN OUR OWN POWER AND WHEREBY WE CAN INCUR NO DANGER
25-123319-0072 FOR THIS KIND OF COMMODITY WILL NOT BEAR EXPORTATION AND FLESH BEING OF TOO TENDER A CONSISTENCE TO ADMIT A LONG CONTINUANCE IN SALT
25-123319-0073 ALTHOUGH PERHAPS I COULD NAME A COUNTRY WHICH WOULD BE GLAD TO EAT UP OUR WHOLE NATION WITHOUT IT AFTER ALL I AM NOT SO VIOLENTLY BENT UPON MY OWN OPINION AS TO REJECT ANY OFFER PROPOSED BY WISE MEN
25-123319-0074 WHICH SHALL BE FOUND EQUALLY INNOCENT CHEAP EASY AND EFFECTUAL BUT BEFORE SOMETHING OF THAT KIND SHALL BE ADVANCED IN CONTRADICTION TO MY SCHEME AND OFFERING A BETTER I DESIRE THE AUTHOR OR AUTHORS
25-123319-0075 WILL BE PLEASED MATURELY TO CONSIDER TWO POINTS FIRST AS THINGS NOW STAND HOW THEY WILL BE ABLE TO FIND FOOD
25-123319-0076 FOR A HUNDRED THOUSAND USELESS MOUTHS AND BACKS AND SECONDLY THERE BEING A ROUND MILLION OF CREATURES IN HUMANE FIGURE THROUGHOUT THIS KINGDOM
25-123319-0077 ADDING THOSE WHO ARE BEGGARS BY PROFESSION TO THE BULK OF FARMERS COTTAGERS AND LABOURERS WITH THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN WHO ARE BEGGARS IN EFFECT I DESIRE THOSE POLITICIANS WHO DISLIKE MY OVERTURE
25-123319-0078 THAT THEY WILL FIRST ASK THE PARENTS OF THESE MORTALS WHETHER THEY WOULD NOT AT THIS DAY THINK IT A GREAT HAPPINESS TO HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR FOOD AT A YEAR OLD IN THE MANNER I PRESCRIBE
25-123319-0079 AND THEREBY HAVE AVOIDED SUCH A PERPETUAL SCENE OF MISFORTUNES AS THEY HAVE SINCE GONE THROUGH BY THE OPPRESSION OF LANDLORDS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF PAYING RENT WITHOUT MONEY OR TRADE THE WANT OF COMMON SUSTENANCE
25-123319-0080 WITH NEITHER HOUSE NOR CLOATHS TO COVER THEM
25-123319-0081 AND THE MOST INEVITABLE PROSPECT OF INTAILING THE LIKE OR GREATER MISERIES UPON THEIR BREED FOR EVER I PROFESS IN THE SINCERITY OF MY HEART
25-123319-0082 THAT I HAVE NOT THE LEAST PERSONAL INTEREST IN ENDEAVOURING TO PROMOTE THIS NECESSARY WORK HAVING NO OTHER MOTIVE THAN THE PUBLICK GOOD OF MY COUNTRY BY ADVANCING OUR TRADE PROVIDING FOR INFANTS RELIEVING THE POOR
