94-3794-0000 MISSY WHEN NEKHLUDOFF HAD FINISHED HIS COFFEE HE WENT TO HIS STUDY TO LOOK AT THE SUMMONS AND FIND OUT WHAT TIME HE WAS TO APPEAR AT THE COURT BEFORE WRITING HIS ANSWER TO THE PRINCESS PASSING THROUGH HIS STUDIO
94-3794-0001 WHERE A FEW STUDIES HUNG ON THE WALLS AND FACING THE EASEL STOOD AN UNFINISHED PICTURE A FEELING OF INABILITY TO ADVANCE IN ART A SENSE OF HIS INCAPACITY CAME OVER HIM HE HAD OFTEN HAD THIS FEELING OF LATE
94-3794-0002 AND EXPLAINED IT BY HIS TOO FINELY DEVELOPED AESTHETIC TASTE STILL THE FEELING WAS A VERY UNPLEASANT ONE SEVEN YEARS BEFORE THIS HE HAD GIVEN UP MILITARY SERVICE FEELING SURE THAT HE HAD A TALENT FOR ART
94-3794-0003 AND HAD LOOKED DOWN WITH SOME DISDAIN AT ALL OTHER ACTIVITY FROM THE HEIGHT OF HIS ARTISTIC STANDPOINT AND NOW IT TURNED OUT THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO DO SO AND THEREFORE EVERYTHING THAT REMINDED HIM OF ALL THIS WAS UNPLEASANT
94-3794-0004 HE LOOKED AT THE LUXURIOUS FITTINGS OF THE STUDIO WITH A HEAVY HEART AND IT WAS IN NO CHEERFUL MOOD THAT HE ENTERED HIS STUDY A LARGE LOFTY ROOM FITTED UP WITH A VIEW TO COMFORT CONVENIENCE AND ELEGANT APPEARANCE
94-3794-0005 HE FOUND THE SUMMONS AT ONCE IN A PIGEON HOLE LABELLED IMMEDIATE OF HIS LARGE WRITING TABLE HE HAD TO APPEAR AT THE COURT AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK NEKHLUDOFF SAT DOWN TO WRITE A NOTE IN REPLY TO THE PRINCESS
94-3794-0006 THANKING HER FOR THE INVITATION AND PROMISING TO TRY AND COME TO DINNER HAVING WRITTEN ONE NOTE HE TORE IT UP AS IT SEEMED TOO INTIMATE HE WROTE ANOTHER BUT IT WAS TOO COLD HE FEARED IT MIGHT GIVE OFFENCE SO HE TORE IT UP TOO
94-3794-0007 HE PRESSED THE BUTTON OF AN ELECTRIC BELL AND HIS SERVANT AN ELDERLY MOROSE LOOKING MAN WITH WHISKERS AND SHAVED CHIN AND LIP WEARING A GREY COTTON APRON ENTERED AT THE DOOR SEND TO FETCH AN ISVOSTCHIK PLEASE YES SIR
94-3794-0008 YES SIR IT IS NOT VERY POLITE BUT I CAN'T WRITE NO MATTER I SHALL SEE HER TODAY THOUGHT NEKHLUDOFF AND WENT TO GET HIS OVERCOAT WHEN HE CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AN ISVOSTCHIK HE KNEW
94-3794-0009 WITH INDIA RUBBER TIRES TO HIS TRAP WAS AT THE DOOR WAITING FOR HIM
94-3794-0010 TURNING HALF ROUND WHEN I DROVE UP AND THE SWISS AT THE DOOR SAYS JUST GONE THE ISVOSTCHIK KNEW THAT NEKHLUDOFF VISITED AT THE KORCHAGINS AND CALLED THERE ON THE CHANCE OF BEING ENGAGED BY HIM
94-3794-0011 EVEN THE ISVOSTCHIKS KNOW OF MY RELATIONS WITH THE KORCHAGINS THOUGHT NEKHLUDOFF AND AGAIN THE QUESTION WHETHER HE SHOULD NOT MARRY PRINCESS KORCHAGIN PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM AND HE COULD NOT DECIDE IT EITHER WAY
94-3794-0012 ANY MORE THAN MOST OF THE QUESTIONS THAT AROSE IN HIS MIND AT THIS TIME IT WAS IN FAVOUR OF MARRIAGE IN GENERAL THAT BESIDES THE COMFORTS OF HEARTH AND HOME IT MADE A MORAL LIFE POSSIBLE AND CHIEFLY THAT A FAMILY WOULD
94-3794-0013 AGAINST MARRIAGE IN GENERAL WAS THE FEAR COMMON TO BACHELORS PAST THEIR FIRST YOUTH OF LOSING FREEDOM AND AN UNCONSCIOUS AWE BEFORE THIS MYSTERIOUS CREATURE A WOMAN
94-3794-0014 IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IN FAVOUR OF MARRYING MISSY HER NAME WAS MARY BUT AS IS USUAL AMONG A CERTAIN SET A NICKNAME HAD BEEN GIVEN HER WAS THAT SHE CAME OF GOOD FAMILY AND DIFFERED IN EVERYTHING
94-3794-0015 MANNER OF SPEAKING WALKING LAUGHING FROM THE COMMON PEOPLE NOT BY ANYTHING EXCEPTIONAL BUT BY HER GOOD BREEDING HE COULD FIND NO OTHER TERM FOR THIS QUALITY THOUGH HE PRIZED IT VERY HIGHLY
94-3794-0016 THEREFORE EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD HIM THIS UNDERSTANDING OF HIM
94-3794-0017 WAS TO NEKHLUDOFF A PROOF OF HER GOOD SENSE AND CORRECT JUDGMENT AGAINST MARRYING MISSY IN PARTICULAR WAS THAT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD A GIRL WITH EVEN HIGHER QUALITIES COULD BE FOUND THAT SHE WAS ALREADY TWENTY SEVEN
94-3794-0018 AND THAT HE WAS HARDLY HER FIRST LOVE THIS LAST IDEA WAS PAINFUL TO HIM HIS PRIDE WOULD NOT RECONCILE ITSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD LOVED SOME ONE ELSE EVEN IN THE PAST
94-3794-0019 OF COURSE SHE COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE SHOULD MEET HIM BUT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS CAPABLE OF LOVING ANOTHER OFFENDED HIM SO THAT HE HAD AS MANY REASONS FOR MARRYING AS AGAINST IT AT ANY RATE THEY WEIGHED EQUALLY WITH NEKHLUDOFF
94-3794-0020 WHO LAUGHED AT HIMSELF AND CALLED HIMSELF THE ASS OF THE FABLE REMAINING LIKE THAT ANIMAL UNDECIDED WHICH HAYCOCK TO TURN TO AT ANY RATE BEFORE I GET AN ANSWER FROM MARY VASILIEVNA
94-3794-0021 THE MARECHAL'S WIFE AND FINISH COMPLETELY WITH HER I CAN DO NOTHING HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND THE CONVICTION THAT HE MIGHT AND WAS EVEN OBLIGED TO DELAY HIS DECISION WAS COMFORTING WELL
94-3794-0022 I SHALL CONSIDER ALL THAT LATER ON HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS THE TRAP DROVE SILENTLY ALONG THE ASPHALT PAVEMENT UP TO THE DOORS OF THE COURT NOW I MUST FULFIL MY PUBLIC DUTIES CONSCIENTIOUSLY AS I AM IN THE HABIT OF ALWAYS DOING
