2785-163322-0000 CHAPTER FIVE WOOL AND WATER SHE CAUGHT THE SHAWL AS SHE SPOKE AND LOOKED ABOUT FOR THE OWNER IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE WHITE QUEEN CAME RUNNING WILDLY THROUGH THE WOOD WITH BOTH ARMS STRETCHED OUT WIDE
2785-163322-0001 AS IF SHE WERE FLYING AND ALICE VERY CIVILLY WENT TO MEET HER WITH THE SHAWL I'M VERY GLAD I HAPPENED TO BE IN THE WAY ALICE SAID AS SHE HELPED HER TO PUT ON HER SHAWL AGAIN THE WHITE QUEEN ONLY LOOKED AT HER IN A HELPLESS FRIGHTENED SORT OF WAY
2785-163322-0002 AND KEPT REPEATING SOMETHING IN A WHISPER TO HERSELF THAT SOUNDED LIKE BREAD AND BUTTER BREAD AND BUTTER AND ALICE FELT THAT IF THERE WAS TO BE ANY CONVERSATION AT ALL SHE MUST MANAGE IT HERSELF SO SHE BEGAN RATHER TIMIDLY
2785-163322-0003 AM I ADDRESSING THE WHITE QUEEN WELL YES IF YOU CALL THAT A DRESSING THE QUEEN SAID IT ISN'T MY NOTION OF THE THING AT ALL ALICE THOUGHT IT WOULD NEVER DO TO HAVE
2785-163322-0004 SO SHE SMILED AND SAID IF YOUR MAJESTY WILL ONLY TELL ME THE RIGHT WAY TO BEGIN I'LL DO IT AS WELL AS I CAN BUT I DON'T WANT IT DONE AT ALL GROANED THE POOR QUEEN I'VE BEEN A DRESSING MYSELF FOR THE LAST TWO HOURS
2785-163322-0005 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL THE BETTER AS IT SEEMED TO ALICE IF SHE HAD GOT SOME ONE ELSE TO DRESS HER SHE WAS SO DREADFULLY UNTIDY EVERY SINGLE THING'S CROOKED ALICE THOUGHT TO HERSELF AND SHE'S ALL OVER PINS
2785-163322-0006 IT CAN'T GO STRAIGHT YOU KNOW IF YOU PIN IT ALL
2785-163322-0007 THE BRUSH HAS GOT ENTANGLED IN IT THE QUEEN SAID WITH A SIGH AND I LOST THE COMB YESTERDAY ALICE CAREFULLY RELEASED THE BRUSH AND DID HER BEST TO GET THE HAIR INTO ORDER COME YOU LOOK RATHER BETTER NOW
2785-163322-0008 IT'S VERY GOOD JAM SAID THE QUEEN WELL I DON'T WANT ANY TO DAY AT ANY RATE YOU COULDN'T HAVE IT IF YOU DID WANT IT THE QUEEN SAID THE RULE IS JAM TO MORROW AND JAM YESTERDAY BUT NEVER JAM TO DAY
2785-163322-0009 IT MUST COME SOMETIMES TO JAM TO DAY ALICE OBJECTED NO IT CAN'T SAID THE QUEEN IT'S JAM EVERY OTHER DAY TO DAY ISN'T ANY OTHER DAY YOU KNOW I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SAID ALICE IT'S DREADFULLY CONFUSING
2785-163322-0010 THAT'S THE EFFECT OF LIVING BACKWARDS THE QUEEN SAID KINDLY IT ALWAYS MAKES ONE A LITTLE GIDDY AT FIRST LIVING BACKWARDS ALICE REPEATED IN GREAT ASTONISHMENT I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING
2785-163322-0011 BUT THERE'S ONE GREAT ADVANTAGE IN IT THAT ONE'S MEMORY WORKS BOTH WAYS I'M SURE MINE ONLY WORKS ONE WAY ALICE REMARKED I CAN'T REMEMBER THINGS BEFORE THEY HAPPEN
2785-163322-0012 THE QUEEN REPLIED IN A CARELESS TONE FOR INSTANCE NOW SHE WENT ON
2785-163322-0013 BUT IT WOULDN'T BE ALL THE BETTER HIS BEING PUNISHED YOU'RE WRONG THERE AT ANY RATE SAID THE QUEEN WERE YOU EVER PUNISHED ONLY FOR FAULTS SAID ALICE AND YOU WERE ALL THE BETTER FOR IT I KNOW THE QUEEN SAID TRIUMPHANTLY YES
2785-163322-0014 BUT THEN I HAD DONE THE THINGS I WAS PUNISHED FOR SAID ALICE THAT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE BUT IF YOU HADN'T DONE THEM THE QUEEN SAID THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER STILL BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER
2785-163322-0015 HER VOICE WENT HIGHER WITH EACH BETTER TILL IT GOT QUITE TO A SQUEAK AT LAST ALICE WAS JUST BEGINNING TO SAY THERE'S A MISTAKE SOMEWHERE WHEN THE QUEEN BEGAN SCREAMING SO LOUD THAT SHE HAD TO LEAVE THE SENTENCE UNFINISHED
2785-163322-0016 I HAVEN'T PRICKED IT YET THE QUEEN SAID BUT I SOON SHALL OH OH OH
2785-163322-0017 WHEN I FASTEN MY SHAWL AGAIN THE POOR QUEEN GROANED OUT THE BROOCH WILL COME UNDONE DIRECTLY OH OH
2785-163322-0018 THE BROOCH FLEW OPEN AND THE QUEEN CLUTCHED WILDLY AT IT AND TRIED TO CLASP IT AGAIN TAKE CARE CRIED ALICE YOU'RE HOLDING IT ALL CROOKED AND SHE CAUGHT AT THE BROOCH BUT IT WAS TOO LATE THE PIN HAD SLIPPED AND THE QUEEN HAD PRICKED HER FINGER
2785-163322-0019 COMING ON I WISH I COULD MANAGE TO BE GLAD THE QUEEN SAID ONLY I NEVER CAN REMEMBER THE RULE YOU MUST BE VERY HAPPY LIVING IN THIS WOOD AND BEING GLAD WHENEVER YOU LIKE ONLY IT IS SO VERY LONELY HERE
2785-163322-0020 EVEN IN THE MIDST OF HER TEARS CAN YOU KEEP FROM CRYING BY CONSIDERING THINGS SHE ASKED THAT'S THE WAY IT'S DONE THE QUEEN SAID WITH GREAT DECISION NOBODY CAN DO TWO THINGS AT ONCE YOU KNOW LET'S CONSIDER YOUR AGE TO BEGIN WITH
2785-163322-0021 FIVE MONTHS AND A DAY I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SAID ALICE CAN'T YOU THE QUEEN SAID IN A PITYING TONE TRY AGAIN
2785-163322-0022 ALICE LAUGHED THERE'S NO USE TRYING SHE SAID ONE CAN'T BELIEVE IMPOSSIBLE THINGS I DARESAY YOU HAVEN'T HAD MUCH PRACTICE SAID THE QUEEN WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE I ALWAYS DID IT FOR HALF AN HOUR A DAY
2785-163322-0023 WHY SOMETIMES I'VE BELIEVED AS MANY AS SIX IMPOSSIBLE THINGS BEFORE BREAKFAST THERE GOES THE SHAWL AGAIN THE BROOCH HAD COME UNDONE AS SHE SPOKE AND A SUDDEN GUST OF WIND
2785-163322-0024 BLEW THE QUEEN'S SHAWL ACROSS A LITTLE BROOK THE QUEEN SPREAD OUT HER ARMS AGAIN AND WENT FLYING AFTER IT AND THIS TIME SHE SUCCEEDED IN CATCHING IT FOR HERSELF
2785-163322-0025 NOW YOU SHALL SEE ME PIN IT ON AGAIN ALL BY MYSELF THEN I HOPE YOUR FINGER IS BETTER NOW ALICE SAID VERY POLITELY AS SHE CROSSED THE LITTLE BROOK AFTER THE QUEEN OH MUCH BETTER CRIED THE QUEEN HER VOICE RISING TO A SQUEAK AS SHE WENT ON
2785-163322-0026 WAS IT REALLY A SHEEP THAT WAS SITTING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTER RUB AS SHE COULD SHE COULD MAKE NOTHING MORE OF IT SHE WAS IN A LITTLE DARK SHOP LEANING WITH HER ELBOWS ON THE COUNTER
2785-163322-0027 AND OPPOSITE TO HER WAS AN OLD SHEEP SITTING IN AN ARM CHAIR KNITTING AND EVERY NOW AND THEN LEAVING OFF TO LOOK AT HER THROUGH A GREAT PAIR OF SPECTACLES WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO BUY THE SHEEP SAID AT LAST
2785-163322-0028 IF YOU LIKE SAID THE SHEEP BUT YOU CAN'T LOOK ALL ROUND YOU UNLESS YOU'VE GOT EYES AT THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD BUT THESE AS IT HAPPENED ALICE HAD NOT GOT SO SHE CONTENTED HERSELF WITH TURNING ROUND LOOKING AT THE SHELVES AS SHE CAME TO THEM
2785-163322-0029 BUT THE ODDEST PART OF IT ALL WAS THAT WHENEVER SHE LOOKED HARD AT ANY SHELF
2785-163322-0030 THAT PARTICULAR SHELF WAS ALWAYS QUITE EMPTY THOUGH THE OTHERS ROUND IT WERE CROWDED AS FULL AS THEY COULD HOLD THINGS FLOW ABOUT SO HERE SHE SAID AT LAST IN A PLAINTIVE TONE AFTER SHE HAD SPENT A MINUTE OR SO IN VAINLY PURSUING A LARGE BRIGHT THING
2785-163322-0031 THAT LOOKED SOMETIMES LIKE A DOLL AND SOMETIMES LIKE A WORK BOX AND WAS ALWAYS IN THE SHELF NEXT ABOVE THE ONE SHE WAS LOOKING AT AND THIS ONE IS THE MOST PROVOKING OF ALL BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT SHE ADDED AS A SUDDEN THOUGHT STRUCK HER
2785-163322-0032 I'LL FOLLOW IT UP TO THE VERY TOP SHELF OF ALL IT'LL PUZZLE IT TO GO THROUGH THE CEILING I EXPECT BUT EVEN THIS PLAN FAILED THE THING WENT THROUGH THE CEILING AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE
2785-163322-0033 GLIDING ALONG BETWEEN BANKS SO THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO DO HER BEST
2785-163322-0034 AS EVERY NOW AND THEN THE OARS GOT FAST IN IT AND WOULD HARDLY COME OUT AGAIN FEATHER FEATHER THE SHEEP CRIED AGAIN TAKING MORE NEEDLES YOU'LL BE CATCHING A CRAB DIRECTLY A DEAR LITTLE CRAB THOUGHT ALICE I SHOULD LIKE THAT
2785-163322-0035 DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME SAY FEATHER THE SHEEP CRIED ANGRILY TAKING UP QUITE A BUNCH OF NEEDLES INDEED I DID SAID ALICE YOU'VE SAID IT VERY OFTEN AND VERY LOUD PLEASE WHERE ARE THE CRABS IN THE WATER OF COURSE SAID THE SHEEP

2785-163322-0040 IF YOU LEAVE OFF ROWING IT'LL STOP OF ITSELF SO THE BOAT WAS LEFT TO DRIFT DOWN THE STREAM AS IT WOULD TILL IT GLIDED GENTLY IN AMONG THE WAVING RUSHES AND THEN THE LITTLE SLEEVES WERE CAREFULLY ROLLED UP
2785-163322-0041 WITH JUST THE ENDS OF HER TANGLED HAIR DIPPING INTO THE WATER WHILE WITH BRIGHT EAGER EYES SHE CAUGHT AT ONE BUNCH AFTER ANOTHER OF THE DARLING SCENTED RUSHES I ONLY HOPE THE BOAT WON'T TIPPLE OVER SHE SAID TO HERSELF OH
2785-163322-0042 WHAT A LOVELY ONE ONLY I COULDN'T QUITE REACH IT AND IT CERTAINLY DID SEEM A LITTLE PROVOKING ALMOST AS IF IT HAPPENED ON PURPOSE SHE THOUGHT THAT THOUGH SHE MANAGED TO PICK PLENTY OF BEAUTIFUL RUSHES
2785-163322-0043 AS THE BOAT GLIDED BY THERE WAS ALWAYS A MORE LOVELY ONE THAT SHE COULDN'T REACH THE PRETTIEST ARE ALWAYS FURTHER SHE SAID AT LAST WITH A SIGH AT THE OBSTINACY OF THE RUSHES IN GROWING SO FAR OFF
2785-163322-0044 AS WITH FLUSHED CHEEKS AND DRIPPING HAIR AND HANDS SHE SCRAMBLED BACK INTO HER PLACE AND BEGAN TO ARRANGE HER NEW FOUND TREASURES
2785-163322-0045 JUST AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED THAT WAS A NICE CRAB YOU CAUGHT SHE REMARKED AS ALICE GOT BACK INTO HER PLACE VERY MUCH RELIEVED TO FIND HERSELF STILL IN THE BOAT WAS IT I DIDN'T SEE IT SAID ALICE

2785-163322-0048 FOR THE SHOP WAS VERY DARK TOWARDS THE END THE EGG SEEMS TO GET FURTHER AWAY
