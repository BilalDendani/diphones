684-137978-0000 CHAPTER ONE THE MOUNTAIN CURDIE WAS THE SON OF PETER THE MINER HE LIVED WITH HIS FATHER AND MOTHER IN A COTTAGE BUILT ON A MOUNTAIN AND HE WORKED WITH HIS FATHER INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN A MOUNTAIN IS A STRANGE AND AWFUL THING
684-137978-0001 IN OLD TIMES WITHOUT KNOWING SO MUCH OF THEIR STRANGENESS AND AWFULNESS AS WE DO PEOPLE WERE YET MORE AFRAID OF MOUNTAINS BUT THEN SOMEHOW THEY HAD NOT COME TO SEE HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY ARE AS WELL AS AWFUL AND THEY HATED THEM
684-137978-0002 AND WHAT PEOPLE HATE THEY MUST FEAR NOW THAT WE HAVE LEARNED TO LOOK AT THEM WITH ADMIRATION PERHAPS WE DO NOT FEEL QUITE AWE ENOUGH OF THEM
684-137978-0003 BUT OF GLOWING HOT MELTED METALS AND STONES AND AS OUR HEARTS KEEP US ALIVE SO THAT GREAT LUMP OF HEAT KEEPS THE EARTH ALIVE IT IS A HUGE POWER OF BURIED SUNLIGHT THAT IS WHAT IT IS
684-137978-0004 NOW THINK OUT OF THAT CAULDRON WHERE ALL THE BUBBLES WOULD BE AS BIG AS THE ALPS IF IT COULD GET ROOM FOR ITS BOILING CERTAIN BUBBLES HAVE BUBBLED OUT AND ESCAPED UP AND AWAY
684-137978-0005 AND THERE THEY STAND IN THE COOL COLD SKY MOUNTAINS THINK OF THE CHANGE AND YOU WILL NO MORE WONDER THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING AWFUL ABOUT THE VERY LOOK OF A MOUNTAIN FROM THE DARKNESS
684-137978-0006 FOR WHERE THE LIGHT HAS NOTHING TO SHINE UPON MUCH THE SAME AS DARKNESS FROM THE HEAT FROM THE ENDLESS TUMULT OF BOILING UNREST UP WITH A SUDDEN HEAVENWARD SHOOT INTO THE WIND AND THE COLD AND THE STARSHINE
684-137978-0007 THAT COMES WANDERING ABOUT THE HOUSE AT NIGHT AND EVERLASTING STILLNESS EXCEPT FOR THE WIND THAT TURNS THE ROCKS AND CAVERNS INTO A ROARING ORGAN FOR THE YOUNG ARCHANGELS THAT ARE STUDYING HOW TO LET OUT THE PENT UP PRAISES OF THEIR HEARTS
684-137978-0008 AND THE MOLTEN MUSIC OF THE STREAMS RUSHING EVER FROM THE BOSOMS OF THE GLACIERS FRESH BORN THINK TOO OF THE CHANGE IN THEIR OWN SUBSTANCE
684-137978-0009 AND THE TREES GROWING OUT OF ITS SIDES LIKE HAIR TO CLOTHE IT AND THE LOVELY GRASS IN THE VALLEYS AND THE GRACIOUS FLOWERS
684-137978-0010 LIKE THE RICH EMBROIDERY OF THE GARMENT BELOW
684-137978-0011 AND ALONG WITH ALL THESE
684-137978-0012 AND THE FRIGHTFUL GULFS OF BLUE AIR CRACKED IN THE GLACIERS AND THE DARK PROFOUND LAKES COVERED LIKE LITTLE ARCTIC OCEANS WITH FLOATING LUMPS OF ICE ALL THIS OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAIN
684-137978-0013 RUNNING CEASELESSLY COLD AND BABBLING THROUGH BANKS CRUSTED WITH CARBUNCLES AND GOLDEN TOPAZES OR OVER A GRAVEL OF WHICH SOME OF THE STONES ARC RUBIES AND EMERALDS PERHAPS DIAMONDS AND SAPPHIRES WHO CAN TELL
684-137978-0014 AND WHOEVER CAN'T TELL IS FREE TO THINK ALL WAITING TO FLASH WAITING FOR MILLIONS OF AGES EVER SINCE THE EARTH FLEW OFF FROM THE SUN A GREAT BLOT OF FIRE AND BEGAN TO COOL
684-137978-0015 THEN THERE ARE CAVERNS FULL OF WATER NUMBINGLY COLD FIERCELY HOT HOTTER THAN ANY BOILING WATER FROM SOME OF THESE THE WATER CANNOT GET OUT AND FROM OTHERS IT RUNS IN CHANNELS AS THE BLOOD IN THE BODY
684-137978-0016 LITTLE VEINS BRING IT DOWN FROM THE ICE ABOVE INTO THE GREAT CAVERNS OF THE MOUNTAIN'S HEART WHENCE THE ARTERIES LET IT OUT AGAIN GUSHING IN PIPES AND CLEFTS AND DUCTS OF ALL SHAPES AND KINDS THROUGH AND THROUGH ITS BULK
684-137978-0017 UNTIL IT SPRINGS NEWBORN TO THE LIGHT AND RUSHES DOWN THE MOUNTAINSIDE IN TORRENTS AND DOWN THE VALLEYS IN RIVERS DOWN DOWN REJOICING TO THE MIGHTY LUNGS OF THE WORLD THAT IS THE SEA
684-137978-0018 HEAVED UP IN BILLOWS TWISTED IN WATERSPOUTS DASHED TO MIST UPON ROCKS BEATEN BY MILLIONS OF TAILS AND BREATHED BY MILLIONS OF GILLS WHENCE AT LAST MELTED INTO VAPOUR BY THE SUN
684-137978-0019 IT IS LIFTED UP PURE INTO THE AIR AND BORNE BY THE SERVANT WINDS BACK TO THE MOUNTAINTOPS AND THE SNOW THE SOLID ICE AND THE MOLTEN STREAM WELL WHEN THE HEART OF THE EARTH HAS THUS COME RUSHING UP AMONG HER CHILDREN
684-137978-0020 BRINGING WITH IT GIFTS OF ALL THAT SHE POSSESSES THEN STRAIGHTWAY INTO IT RUSH HER CHILDREN TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN FIND THERE WITH PICKAXE AND SPADE AND CROWBAR WITH BORING CHISEL AND BLASTING POWDER
684-137978-0021 THEY FORCE THEIR WAY BACK IS IT TO SEARCH FOR WHAT TOYS THEY MAY HAVE LEFT IN THEIR LONG FORGOTTEN NURSERIES HENCE THE MOUNTAINS THAT LIFT THEIR HEADS INTO THE CLEAR AIR AND ARE DOTTED OVER WITH THE DWELLINGS OF MEN
684-137978-0022 ARE TUNNELLED AND BORED IN THE DARKNESS OF THEIR BOSOMS BY THE DWELLERS IN THE HOUSES WHICH THEY HOLD UP TO THE SUN AND AIR CURDIE AND HIS FATHER WERE OF THESE THEIR BUSINESS WAS TO BRING TO LIGHT HIDDEN THINGS
684-137978-0023 THEY SOUGHT SILVER IN THE ROCK AND FOUND IT AND CARRIED IT OUT OF THE MANY OTHER PRECIOUS THINGS IN THEIR MOUNTAIN THEY KNEW LITTLE OR NOTHING SILVER ORE WAS WHAT THEY WERE SENT TO FIND AND IN DARKNESS AND DANGER THEY FOUND IT
684-137978-0024 BUT OH HOW SWEET WAS THE AIR ON THE MOUNTAIN FACE WHEN THEY CAME OUT AT SUNSET TO GO HOME TO WIFE AND MOTHER THEY DID BREATHE DEEP THEN THE MINES BELONGED TO THE KING OF THE COUNTRY
684-137978-0025 AND THE MINERS WERE HIS SERVANTS WORKING UNDER HIS OVERSEERS AND OFFICERS HE WAS A REAL KING THAT IS ONE WHO RULED FOR THE GOOD OF HIS PEOPLE AND NOT TO PLEASE HIMSELF
684-137978-0026 AND HE WANTED THE SILVER NOT TO BUY RICH THINGS FOR HIMSELF BUT TO HELP HIM TO GOVERN THE COUNTRY AND PAY THE ONES THAT DEFENDED IT FROM CERTAIN TROUBLESOME NEIGHBOURS AND THE JUDGES WHOM HE SET TO PORTION OUT RIGHTEOUSNESS AMONG THE PEOPLE
684-137978-0027 THAT SO THEY MIGHT LEARN IT THEMSELVES AND COME TO DO WITHOUT JUDGES AT ALL NOTHING THAT COULD BE GOT FROM THE HEART OF THE EARTH COULD HAVE BEEN PUT TO BETTER PURPOSES THAN THE SILVER THE KING'S MINERS GOT FOR HIM
684-137978-0028 THERE WERE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WHO WHEN IT CAME INTO THEIR HANDS DEGRADED IT BY LOCKING IT UP IN A CHEST AND THEN IT GREW DISEASED AND WAS CALLED MAMMON AND BRED ALL SORTS OF QUARRELS
684-137978-0029 BUT WHEN FIRST IT LEFT THE KING'S HANDS IT NEVER MADE ANY BUT FRIENDS AND THE AIR OF THE WORLD KEPT IT CLEAN ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE THIS STORY BEGAN A SERIES OF VERY REMARKABLE EVENTS HAD JUST ENDED
684-137978-0030 UPON THE MOUNTAIN ON ONE OF ITS MANY CLAWS STOOD A GRAND OLD HOUSE HALF FARMHOUSE HALF CASTLE BELONGING TO THE KING AND THERE HIS ONLY CHILD
684-137978-0031 TILL SHE WAS NEARLY NINE YEARS OLD AND WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE CONTINUED MUCH LONGER BUT FOR THE STRANGE EVENTS TO WHICH I HAVE REFERRED AT THAT TIME THE HOLLOW PLACES OF THE MOUNTAIN WERE INHABITED BY CREATURES CALLED GOBLINS
684-137978-0032 WHO FOR VARIOUS REASONS AND IN VARIOUS WAYS MADE THEMSELVES TROUBLESOME TO ALL BUT TO THE LITTLE PRINCESS DANGEROUS MAINLY BY THE WATCHFUL DEVOTION AND ENERGY OF CURDIE HOWEVER
684-137978-0033 THEIR DESIGNS HAD BEEN UTTERLY DEFEATED AND MADE TO RECOIL UPON THEMSELVES TO THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION SO THAT NOW THERE WERE VERY FEW OF THEM LEFT ALIVE AND THE MINERS DID NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS A SINGLE GOBLIN REMAINING IN THE WHOLE INSIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN
684-137978-0034 THE KING HAD BEEN SO PLEASED WITH THE BOY THEN APPROACHING THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE THAT WHEN HE CARRIED AWAY HIS DAUGHTER HE ASKED HIM TO ACCOMPANY THEM
684-137978-0035 WAS WORTH TEN THOUSAND OFFERS TO DIE FOR HIS SAKE AND WOULD PROVE SO WHEN THE RIGHT TIME CAME AS FOR HIS FATHER AND MOTHER THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM UP WITHOUT A GRUMBLE FOR THEY WERE JUST AS GOOD AS THE KING
684-137978-0036 AND HE AND THEY UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY BUT IN THIS MATTER NOT SEEING THAT HE COULD DO ANYTHING FOR THE KING WHICH ONE OF HIS NUMEROUS ATTENDANTS COULD NOT DO AS WELL CURDIE FELT THAT IT WAS FOR HIM TO DECIDE
684-137978-0037 SO THE KING TOOK A KIND FAREWELL OF THEM ALL AND RODE AWAY WITH HIS DAUGHTER ON HIS HORSE BEFORE HIM
684-137978-0038 AS FOR HIS VERSES THERE WAS NO OCCASION TO MAKE ANY NOW HE HAD MADE THEM ONLY TO DRIVE AWAY THE GOBLINS AND THEY WERE ALL GONE A GOOD RIDDANCE ONLY THE PRINCESS WAS GONE TOO
684-137978-0039 HE WOULD RATHER HAVE HAD THINGS AS THEY WERE EXCEPT FOR THE PRINCESS'S SAKE BUT WHOEVER IS DILIGENT WILL SOON BE CHEERFUL AND THOUGH THE MINERS MISSED THE HOUSEHOLD OF THE CASTLE THEY YET MANAGED TO GET ON WITHOUT THEM
684-137978-0040 PETER AND HIS WIFE HOWEVER WERE TROUBLED WITH THE FANCY THAT THEY HAD STOOD IN THE WAY OF THEIR BOY'S GOOD FORTUNE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A FINE THING FOR HIM AND THEM TOO THEY THOUGHT IF HE HAD RIDDEN WITH THE GOOD KING'S TRAIN
684-137978-0041 HOW BEAUTIFUL HE LOOKED THEY SAID WHEN HE RODE THE KING'S OWN HORSE THROUGH THE RIVER THAT THE GOBLINS HAD SENT OUT OF THE HILL HE MIGHT SOON HAVE BEEN A CAPTAIN THEY DID BELIEVE THE GOOD KIND PEOPLE DID NOT REFLECT
684-137978-0042 THAT THE ROAD TO THE NEXT DUTY IS THE ONLY STRAIGHT ONE OR THAT FOR THEIR FANCIED GOOD WE SHOULD NEVER WISH OUR CHILDREN OR FRIENDS TO DO WHAT WE WOULD NOT DO OURSELVES IF WE WERE IN THEIR POSITION
