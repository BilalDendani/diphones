4731-58193-0000 I MUST PASS RAPIDLY OVER THE STIRRING EVENTS OF MY EARLY LIFE WHEN I WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS OLD I WENT TO LIVE WITH MY MASTER'S ELDEST SON A PRESBYTERIAN MINISTER
4731-58193-0001 A GIRL THAT HE HAD MARRIED IN THE HUMBLE WALKS OF LIFE
4731-58193-0002 I WAS THEIR ONLY SERVANT AND A GRACIOUS LOAN AT THAT
4731-58193-0003 FROM THE VERY FIRST I DID THE WORK OF THREE SERVANTS AND YET I WAS SCOLDED AND REGARDED WITH DISTRUST THE YEARS PASSED SLOWLY AND I CONTINUED TO SERVE THEM
4731-58193-0004 AND AT THE SAME TIME GREW INTO STRONG HEALTHY WOMANHOOD I WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN WHEN WE REMOVED FROM VIRGINIA TO HILLSBORO NORTH CAROLINA
4731-58193-0005 THE SALARY WAS SMALL AND WE STILL HAD TO PRACTISE THE CLOSEST ECONOMY MISTER BINGHAM A HARD CRUEL MAN THE VILLAGE SCHOOLMASTER WAS A MEMBER OF MY YOUNG MASTER'S CHURCH AND HE WAS A FREQUENT VISITOR TO THE PARSONAGE
4731-58193-0006 SHE WHOM I CALLED MISTRESS SEEMED TO BE DESIROUS TO WREAK VENGEANCE ON ME FOR SOMETHING
4731-58193-0007 DURING THIS TIME MY MASTER WAS UNUSUALLY KIND TO ME HE WAS NATURALLY A GOOD HEARTED MAN BUT WAS INFLUENCED BY HIS WIFE IT WAS SATURDAY EVENING AND WHILE I WAS BENDING OVER THE BED WATCHING THE BABY THAT I HAD JUST HUSHED INTO SLUMBER
4731-58193-0008 MISTER BINGHAM CAME TO THE DOOR AND ASKED ME TO GO WITH HIM TO HIS STUDY WONDERING WHAT HE MEANT BY HIS STRANGE REQUEST I FOLLOWED HIM AND WHEN WE HAD ENTERED THE STUDY HE CLOSED THE DOOR AND IN HIS BLUNT WAY REMARKED LIZZIE I AM GOING TO FLOG YOU
4731-58193-0009 I WAS THUNDERSTRUCK AND TRIED TO THINK IF I HAD BEEN REMISS IN ANYTHING I COULD NOT RECOLLECT OF DOING ANYTHING TO DESERVE PUNISHMENT AND WITH SURPRISE EXCLAIMED WHIP ME MISTER BINGHAM WHAT FOR NO MATTER HE REPLIED
4731-58193-0010 I AM GOING TO WHIP YOU SO TAKE DOWN YOUR DRESS THIS INSTANT RECOLLECT I WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE WAS A WOMAN FULLY DEVELOPED AND YET THIS MAN COOLLY BADE ME TAKE DOWN MY DRESS I DREW MYSELF UP PROUDLY FIRMLY
4731-58193-0011 AND SAID NO MISTER BINGHAM I SHALL NOT TAKE DOWN MY DRESS BEFORE YOU MOREOVER YOU SHALL NOT WHIP ME UNLESS YOU PROVE THE STRONGER NOBODY HAS A RIGHT TO WHIP ME BUT MY OWN MASTER AND NOBODY SHALL DO SO IF I CAN PREVENT IT
4731-58193-0012 MY WORDS SEEMED TO EXASPERATE HIM HE SEIZED A ROPE CAUGHT ME ROUGHLY AND TRIED TO TIE ME I RESISTED WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE WAS THE STRONGER OF THE TWO AND AFTER A HARD STRUGGLE SUCCEEDED IN BINDING MY HANDS AND TEARING MY DRESS FROM MY BACK
4731-58193-0013 AND BEGAN TO PLY IT FREELY OVER MY SHOULDERS WITH STEADY HAND AND PRACTISED EYE HE WOULD RAISE THE INSTRUMENT OF TORTURE NERVE HIMSELF FOR A BLOW
4731-58193-0014 IT CUT THE SKIN RAISED GREAT WELTS AND THE WARM BLOOD TRICKLED DOWN MY BACK OH GOD I CAN FEEL THE TORTURE NOW THE TERRIBLE EXCRUCIATING AGONY OF THOSE MOMENTS I DID NOT SCREAM
4731-58193-0015 I WAS TOO PROUD TO LET MY TORMENTOR KNOW WHAT I WAS SUFFERING
4731-58193-0016 AND I STOOD LIKE A STATUE WHILE THE KEEN LASH CUT DEEP INTO MY FLESH AS SOON AS I WAS RELEASED STUNNED WITH PAIN BRUISED AND BLEEDING I WENT HOME AND RUSHED INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE PASTOR AND HIS WIFE WILDLY EXCLAIMING MASTER ROBERT
4731-58193-0017 WHY DID YOU LET MISTER BINGHAM FLOG ME WHAT HAVE I DONE THAT I SHOULD BE SO PUNISHED
4731-58193-0018 I ROSE BEWILDERED ALMOST DEAD WITH PAIN CREPT TO MY ROOM DRESSED MY BRUISED ARMS AND BACK AS BEST I COULD AND THEN LAY DOWN BUT NOT TO SLEEP NO I COULD NOT SLEEP
4731-58193-0019 FOR I WAS SUFFERING MENTAL AS WELL AS BODILY TORTURE MY SPIRIT REBELLED AGAINST THE UNJUSTNESS THAT HAD BEEN INFLICTED UPON ME AND THOUGH I TRIED TO SMOTHER MY ANGER AND TO FORGIVE THOSE WHO HAD BEEN SO CRUEL TO ME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THE NEXT MORNING I WAS MORE CALM
4731-58193-0020 BUT THE KIND WORD WAS NOT PROFFERED AND IT MAY BE POSSIBLE THAT I GREW SOMEWHAT WAYWARD AND SULLEN THOUGH I HAD FAULTS I KNOW NOW AS I FELT THEN
4731-58193-0021 IT SEEMS THAT MISTER BINGHAM HAD PLEDGED HIMSELF TO MISSUS BURWELL TO SUBDUE WHAT HE CALLED MY STUBBORN PRIDE ON FRIDAY FOLLOWING THE SATURDAY ON WHICH I WAS SO SAVAGELY BEATEN
4731-58193-0022 ON ENTERING THE ROOM I FOUND HIM PREPARED WITH A NEW ROPE AND A NEW COWHIDE I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS READY TO DIE BUT THAT HE COULD NOT CONQUER ME IN STRUGGLING WITH HIM I BIT HIS FINGER SEVERELY
4731-58193-0023 WHEN HE SEIZED A HEAVY STICK AND BEAT ME WITH IT IN A SHAMEFUL MANNER AGAIN I WENT HOME SORE AND BLEEDING BUT WITH PRIDE AS STRONG AND DEFIANT AS EVER THE FOLLOWING THURSDAY MISTER BINGHAM AGAIN TRIED TO CONQUER ME BUT IN VAIN WE STRUGGLED
4731-58193-0024 AND HE STRUCK ME MANY SAVAGE BLOWS AS I STOOD BLEEDING BEFORE HIM NEARLY EXHAUSTED WITH HIS EFFORTS HE BURST INTO TEARS AND DECLARED THAT IT WOULD BE A SIN TO BEAT ME ANY MORE MY SUFFERING AT LAST SUBDUED HIS HARD HEART
4731-58193-0025 WHO EXPOUNDED THE HOLY SCRIPTURES SABBATH AFTER SABBATH FROM THE PULPIT WHEN MISTER BINGHAM REFUSED TO WHIP ME ANY MORE
4731-58193-0026 ONE MORNING HE WENT TO THE WOOD PILE TOOK AN OAK BROOM CUT THE HANDLE OFF
4731-58193-0027 I WAS SO BADLY BRUISED THAT I WAS UNABLE TO LEAVE MY BED FOR FIVE DAYS I WILL NOT DWELL UPON THE BITTER ANGUISH OF THESE HOURS FOR EVEN THE THOUGHT OF THEM NOW MAKES ME SHUDDER
4731-58193-0028 HE RESOLVED TO MAKE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO SUBDUE MY PROUD REBELLIOUS SPIRIT MADE THE ATTEMPT AND AGAIN FAILED WHEN HE TOLD ME WITH AN AIR OF PENITENCE THAT HE SHOULD NEVER STRIKE ME ANOTHER BLOW AND FAITHFULLY HE KEPT HIS WORD THESE REVOLTING SCENES CREATED A GREAT SENSATION AT THE TIME
4731-58193-0029 AND I FLATTER MYSELF THAT THE ACTIONS OF THOSE WHO HAD CONSPIRED AGAINST ME WERE NOT VIEWED IN A LIGHT TO REFLECT MUCH CREDIT UPON THEM THE SAVAGE EFFORTS TO SUBDUE MY PRIDE WERE NOT THE ONLY THINGS THAT BROUGHT ME SUFFERING AND DEEP MORTIFICATION DURING MY RESIDENCE AT HILLSBORO
4731-58193-0030 I WAS REGARDED AS FAIR LOOKING FOR ONE OF MY RACE AND FOR FOUR YEARS A WHITE MAN I SPARE THE WORLD HIS NAME HAD BASE DESIGNS UPON ME
4731-58193-0031 SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT HE PERSECUTED ME FOR FOUR YEARS AND I I BECAME A MOTHER THE CHILD OF WHICH HE WAS THE FATHER WAS THE ONLY CHILD THAT I EVER BROUGHT INTO THE WORLD IF MY POOR BOY EVER SUFFERED ANY HUMILIATING PANGS ON ACCOUNT OF BIRTH
4731-58193-0032 HE COULD NOT BLAME HIS MOTHER FOR GOD KNOWS THAT SHE DID NOT WISH TO GIVE HIM LIFE HE MUST BLAME THE EDICTS OF THAT SOCIETY WHICH DEEMED IT NO CRIME TO UNDERMINE THE VIRTUE OF GIRLS IN MY THEN POSITION
4731-58193-0033 NORTH CAROLINA HILLSBORO APRIL TENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT MY DEAR MOTHER
4731-58193-0034 AND FOR THAT REASON YOU MUST EXCUSE ME I THOUGHT VERY HARD OF YOU FOR NOT WRITING TO ME
4731-58193-0035 AND TELL ME HOW YOU LIKE MARSFIELD AND IF YOU HAVE SEEN ANY OF OLD ACQUAINTANCES
4731-58193-0036 I WANT TO HEAR OF THE FAMILY AT HOME VERY MUCH INDEED I REALLY BELIEVE YOU AND ALL THE FAMILY HAVE FORGOTTEN ME IF NOT I CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE HEARD FROM SOME OF YOU SINCE YOU LEFT BOYTON IF IT WAS ONLY A LINE NEVERTHELESS
4731-58193-0037 I LOVE YOU ALL VERY DEARLY AND SHALL ALTHOUGH I MAY NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN NOR DO I EVER EXPECT TO MISS ANNA IS GOING TO PETERSBURGH NEXT WINTER BUT SHE SAYS THAT SHE DOES NOT INTEND TAKE ME
4731-58193-0038 I HAVE OFTEN WISHED THAT I LIVED WHERE I KNEW I NEVER COULD SEE YOU FOR THEN I WOULD NOT HAVE MY HOPES RAISED AND TO BE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS MANNER HOWEVER IT IS SAID THAT A BAD BEGINNING MAKES A GOOD ENDING
4731-58193-0039 BUT I HARDLY EXPECT TO SEE THAT HAPPY DAY AT THIS PLACE GIVE MY LOVE TO ALL THE FAMILY BOTH WHITE AND BLACK
4731-58193-0040 THOUGH IT IS QUITE LATE IN THE DAY TO BE THANKING FOR THEM TELL AUNT BELLA THAT I WAS VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HER FOR HER PRESENT I HAVE BEEN SO PARTICULAR WITH IT THAT I HAVE ONLY WORN IT ONCE THERE HAVE BEEN SIX WEDDINGS SINCE OCTOBER
4731-58193-0041 THE MOST RESPECTABLE ONE WAS ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AGO I WAS ASKED TO BE THE FIRST ATTENDANT BUT AS USUAL WITH ALL MY EXPECTATIONS I WAS DISAPPOINTED FOR ON THE WEDDING DAY I FELT MORE LIKE BEING LOCKED UP IN A THREE CORNERED BOX THAN ATTENDING A WEDDING
4731-58193-0042 WHEN THE NIGHT CAME I WAS IN QUITE A TROUBLE I DID NOT KNOW WHETHER MY FROCK WAS CLEAN OR DIRTY I ONLY HAD A WEEK'S NOTICE AND THE BODY AND SLEEVES TO MAKE AND ONLY ONE HOUR EVERY NIGHT TO WORK ON IT
4731-58193-0043 SO YOU CAN SEE WITH THESE TROUBLES TO OVERCOME MY CHANCE WAS RATHER SLIM I MUST NOW CLOSE ALTHOUGH I COULD FILL TEN PAGES WITH MY GRIEFS AND MISFORTUNES NO TONGUE COULD EXPRESS THEM AS I FEEL DON'T FORGET ME THOUGH AND ANSWER MY LETTERS SOON
4731-58193-0044 BUT MISS ANNA SAYS IT IS TIME I HAD FINISHED TELL MISS ELIZABETH THAT I WISH SHE WOULD MAKE HASTE AND GET MARRIED FOR MISTRESS SAYS THAT I BELONG TO HER WHEN SHE GETS MARRIED
