569-126489-0000 THE TALE OF TIMMY TIPTOES
569-126489-0001 THERE WAS A LITTLE FAT COMFORTABLE GREY SQUIRREL CALLED TIMMY TIPTOES HE HAD A NEST THATCHED WITH LEAVES IN THE TOP OF A TALL TREE AND
569-126489-0002 HE HAD A LITTLE SQUIRREL WIFE CALLED GOODY TIMMY TIPTOES SAT OUT ENJOYING THE BREEZE HE WHISKED HIS TAIL AND CHUCKLED LITTLE WIFE GOODY THE NUTS ARE RIPE
569-126489-0003 WE MUST LAY UP A STORE FOR WINTER AND SPRING GOODY TIPTOES WAS BUSY PUSHING MOSS UNDER THE THATCH THE NEST IS SO SNUG WE SHALL BE SOUND ASLEEP ALL WINTER
569-126489-0004 THEN WE SHALL WAKE UP ALL THE THINNER WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO EAT IN SPRING TIME REPLIED PRUDENT TIMOTHY WHEN TIMMY AND GOODY TIPTOES CAME TO THE NUT THICKET THEY FOUND OTHER SQUIRRELS WERE THERE ALREADY
569-126489-0005 TIMMY TOOK OFF HIS JACKET AND HUNG IT ON A TWIG THEY WORKED AWAY QUIETLY BY THEMSELVES EVERY DAY THEY MADE SEVERAL JOURNEYS
569-126489-0006 THEY CARRIED THEM AWAY IN BAGS AND STORED THEM IN SEVERAL HOLLOW STUMPS NEAR THE TREE WHERE THEY HAD BUILT THEIR NEST WHEN THESE STUMPS WERE FULL THEY BEGAN TO EMPTY THE BAGS INTO A HOLE HIGH UP A TREE
569-126489-0007 THAT HAD BELONGED TO A WOODPECKER THE NUTS RATTLED DOWN DOWN DOWN INSIDE HOW SHALL YOU EVER GET THEM OUT AGAIN IT IS LIKE A MONEY BOX SAID GOODY
569-126489-0008 I SHALL BE MUCH THINNER BEFORE SPRINGTIME MY LOVE SAID TIMMY TIPTOES PEEPING INTO THE HOLE THEY DID COLLECT QUANTITIES BECAUSE THEY DID NOT LOSE THEM SQUIRRELS WHO BURY THEIR NUTS IN THE GROUND
569-126489-0009 LOSE MORE THAN HALF BECAUSE THEY CANNOT REMEMBER THE PLACE THE MOST FORGETFUL SQUIRREL IN THE WOOD WAS CALLED SILVERTAIL HE BEGAN TO DIG AND HE COULD NOT REMEMBER
569-126489-0010 AND THEN HE DUG AGAIN AND FOUND SOME NUTS THAT DID NOT BELONG TO HIM AND THERE WAS A FIGHT AND OTHER SQUIRRELS BEGAN TO DIG THE WHOLE WOOD WAS IN COMMOTION UNFORTUNATELY
569-126489-0011 JUST AT THIS TIME A FLOCK OF LITTLE BIRDS FLEW BY FROM BUSH TO BUSH SEARCHING FOR GREEN CATERPILLARS AND SPIDERS THERE WERE SEVERAL SORTS OF LITTLE BIRDS TWITTERING DIFFERENT SONGS
569-126489-0012 THE FIRST ONE SANG WHO'S BIN DIGGING UP MY NUTS WHO'S BEEN DIGGING UP MY NUTS AND ANOTHER SANG
569-126489-0013 THE SQUIRRELS FOLLOWED AND LISTENED THE FIRST LITTLE BIRD FLEW INTO THE BUSH WHERE TIMMY AND GOODY TIPTOES WERE QUIETLY TYING UP THEIR BAGS
569-126489-0014 TIMMY TIPTOES WENT ON WITH HIS WORK WITHOUT REPLYING INDEED THE LITTLE BIRD DID NOT EXPECT AN ANSWER IT WAS ONLY SINGING ITS NATURAL SONG AND IT MEANT NOTHING AT ALL BUT WHEN THE OTHER SQUIRRELS HEARD THAT SONG
569-126489-0015 THEY RUSHED UPON TIMMY TIPTOES AND CUFFED AND SCRATCHED HIM AND UPSET HIS BAG OF NUTS THE INNOCENT LITTLE BIRD WHICH HAD CAUSED ALL THE MISCHIEF FLEW AWAY IN A FRIGHT TIMMY ROLLED OVER AND OVER
569-126489-0016 AND THEN TURNED TAIL AND FLED TOWARDS HIS NEST FOLLOWED BY A CROWD OF SQUIRRELS SHOUTING WHO'S BEEN DIGGING UP MY NUTS THEY CAUGHT HIM
569-126489-0017 WHERE THERE WAS THE LITTLE ROUND HOLE AND THEY PUSHED HIM IN THE HOLE WAS MUCH TOO SMALL FOR TIMMY TIPTOES FIGURE THEY SQUEEZED HIM DREADFULLY IT WAS A WONDER THEY DID NOT BREAK HIS RIBS
569-126489-0018 WE WILL LEAVE HIM HERE TILL HE CONFESSES SAID SILVERTAIL SQUIRREL AND HE SHOUTED INTO THE HOLE WHO'S BEEN DIGGING UP MY NUTS TIMMY TIPTOES MADE NO REPLY HE HAD TUMBLED DOWN INSIDE THE TREE
569-126489-0019 UPON HALF A PECK OF NUTS BELONGING TO HIMSELF HE LAY QUITE STUNNED AND STILL GOODY TIPTOES PICKED UP THE NUT BAGS AND WENT HOME SHE MADE A CUP OF TEA FOR TIMMY BUT HE DIDN'T COME AND DIDN'T COME
569-126489-0020 GOODY TIPTOES PASSED A LONELY AND UNHAPPY NIGHT NEXT MORNING SHE VENTURED BACK TO THE NUT BUSHES TO LOOK FOR HIM BUT THE OTHER UNKIND SQUIRRELS DROVE HER AWAY
569-126489-0021 SHE WANDERED ALL OVER THE WOOD CALLING TIMMY TIPTOES TIMMY TIP TOES OH WHERE IS TIMMY TIPTOES IN THE MEANTIME TIMMY TIPTOES CAME TO HIS SENSES
569-126489-0022 HE FOUND HIMSELF TUCKED UP IN A LITTLE MOSS BED VERY MUCH IN THE DARK FEELING SORE IT SEEMED TO BE UNDER GROUND TIMMY COUGHED AND GROANED BECAUSE HIS RIBS HURTED HIM
569-126489-0023 THERE WAS A CHIRPY NOISE AND A SMALL STRIPED CHIPMUNK APPEARED WITH A NIGHT LIGHT AND HOPED HE FELT BETTER IT WAS MOST KIND TO TIMMY TIPTOES IT LENT HIM ITS NIGHTCAP AND THE HOUSE WAS FULL OF PROVISIONS
569-126489-0024 THE CHIPMUNK EXPLAINED THAT IT HAD RAINED NUTS THROUGH THE TOP OF THE TREE BESIDES I FOUND A FEW BURIED IT LAUGHED AND CHUCKLED WHEN IT HEARD TIMMY'S STORY

569-126489-0026 SHE DID NOT PUT ANY MORE NUTS INTO THE WOODPECKER'S HOLE BECAUSE SHE HAD ALWAYS DOUBTED HOW THEY COULD BE GOT OUT AGAIN SHE HID THEM UNDER A TREE ROOT THEY RATTLED DOWN DOWN DOWN
569-126489-0027 ONCE WHEN GOODY EMPTIED AN EXTRA BIG BAGFUL THERE WAS A DECIDED SQUEAK AND NEXT TIME GOODY BROUGHT ANOTHER BAGFUL A LITTLE STRIPED CHIPMUNK SCRAMBLED OUT IN A HURRY IT IS GETTING PERFECTLY FULL UP DOWNSTAIRS
