4172-185480-0000 FEW PERSONS WHO HAVE VISITED THE FRENCH CAPITAL WITHIN THE LAST TEN OR TWELVE YEARS CAN HAVE FAILED TO HAVE SEEN HIM AND ONCE SEEN HE WAS NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN WHILE PASSING THROUGH THE PUBLIC STREETS THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE TO DISTINGUISH HIM
4172-185480-0001 HE DROVE A PAIR OF BAY HORSES ATTACHED TO AN OPEN CARRIAGE WITH TWO SEATS THE BACK ONE ALWAYS OCCUPIED BY HIS VALET
4172-185480-0002 AT OTHER TIMES NEAR THE COLUMN IN THE PLACE VENDOME BUT USUALLY
4172-185480-0003 OR THE PLACE DE LA MADELEINE ON SUNDAYS HIS FAVORITE LOCALITY WAS THE PLACE DE LA BOURSE
4172-185480-0004 WITH A MOST SELF SATISFIED COUNTENANCE WHICH SEEMED TO SAY I AM MASTER HERE
4172-185480-0005 ARRIVING AT HIS DESTINED STOPPING PLACE HIS CARRIAGE HALTED HIS SERVANT HANDED HIM A CASE FROM WHICH HE TOOK SEVERAL LARGE PORTRAITS OF HIMSELF WHICH HE HUNG PROMINENTLY UPON THE SIDES OF HIS CARRIAGE
4172-185480-0006 AND ALSO PLACED IN FRONT OF HIM A VASE FILLED WITH MEDALS BEARING HIS LIKENESS ON ONE SIDE AND A DESCRIPTION OF HIS PENCILS ON THE OTHER HE THEN LEISURELY COMMENCED A CHANGE OF COSTUME
4172-185480-0007 HIS ROUND HAT WAS DISPLACED BY A MAGNIFICENT BURNISHED HELMET MOUNTED WITH RICH PLUMES OF VARIOUS BRILLIANT COLORS HIS OVERCOAT WAS LAID ASIDE AND HE DONNED IN ITS STEAD
4172-185480-0008 A COSTLY VELVET TUNIC WITH GOLD FRINGES HE THEN DREW A PAIR OF POLISHED STEEL GAUNTLETS UPON HIS HANDS
4172-185480-0009 AND PLACED A RICHLY MOUNTED SWORD AT HIS SIDE HIS SERVANT WATCHED HIM CLOSELY AND UPON RECEIVING A SIGN FROM HIS MASTER HE TOO PUT ON HIS OFFICIAL COSTUME WHICH CONSISTED OF A VELVET ROBE
4172-185480-0010 AND A HELMET THE SERVANT THEN STRUCK UP A TUNE ON THE RICHLY TONED ORGAN WHICH ALWAYS FORMED A PART
4172-185480-0011 THE GROTESQUE APPEARANCE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THE MUSIC SOON DREW TOGETHER AN ADMIRING CROWD THEN THE GREAT CHARLATAN STOOD UPON HIS FEET HIS MANNER WAS CALM DIGNIFIED
4172-185480-0012 IMPOSING INDEED ALMOST SOLEMN FOR HIS FACE WAS AS SERIOUS AS THAT OF THE CHIEF MOURNER AT A FUNERAL HIS SHARP INTELLIGENT EYE SCRUTINIZED THE THRONG WHICH WAS PRESSING AROUND HIS CARRIAGE UNTIL
4172-185480-0013 IT RESTED APPARENTLY UPON SOME PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL WHEN HE GAVE A START THEN WITH A DARK ANGRY EXPRESSION AS IF THE SIGHT WAS REPULSIVE HE ABRUPTLY DROPPED THE VISOR OF HIS HELMET
4172-185480-0014 AND THUS COVERED HIS FACE FROM THE GAZE OF THE ANXIOUS CROWD THIS BIT OF COQUETRY PRODUCED THE DESIRED EFFECT IN WHETTING THE APPETITE OF THE MULTITUDE WHO WERE IMPATIENTLY WAITING TO HEAR HIM SPEAK
4172-185480-0015 HE RAISED HIS HAND AND HIS SERVANT UNDERSTANDING THE SIGN STOPPED THE ORGAN
4172-185480-0016 STEPPED FORWARD TO THE FRONT OF THE CARRIAGE GAVE A SLIGHT COUGH INDICATIVE OF A PREPARATION TO SPEAK OPENED HIS MOUTH BUT INSTANTLY GIVING A MORE FEARFUL START AND ASSUMING A MORE SUDDEN FROWN THAN BEFORE HE TOOK HIS SEAT
4172-185480-0017 AS IF QUITE OVERCOME BY SOME UNPLEASANT OBJECT WHICH HIS EYES HAD RESTED UPON THUS FAR HE HAD NOT SPOKEN A WORD AT LAST THE PRELUDE ENDED AND THE COMEDY COMMENCED
4172-185480-0018 STEPPING FORWARD AGAIN TO THE FRONT OF HIS CARRIAGE WHERE ALL THE GAPING CROWD COULD CATCH EVERY WORD HE EXCLAIMED GENTLEMEN YOU LOOK ASTONISHED YOU SEEM TO WONDER AND ASK YOURSELVES
4172-185480-0019 WHO IS THIS MODERN QUIXOTE WHAT MEAN THIS COSTUME OF BY GONE CENTURIES THIS GOLDEN CHARIOT THESE RICHLY CAPARISONED STEEDS WHAT IS THE NAME AND PURPOSE OF THIS CURIOUS KNIGHT ERRANT
4172-185480-0020 GENTLEMEN I WILL CONDESCEND TO ANSWER YOUR QUERIES
4172-185480-0021 THE GREAT CHARLATAN OF FRANCE YES GENTLEMEN I AM A CHARLATAN A MOUNTEBANK IT IS MY PROFESSION NOT FROM CHOICE BUT FROM NECESSITY YOU GENTLEMEN CREATED THAT NECESSITY
4172-185480-0022 YOU WOULD NOT PATRONIZE TRUE UNPRETENDING HONEST MERIT BUT YOU ARE ATTRACTED BY MY GLITTERING CASQUE MY SWEEPING CREST MY WAVING PLUMES
4172-185480-0023 YOU ARE CAPTIVATED BY DIN AND GLITTER AND THEREIN LIES MY STRENGTH YEARS AGO I HIRED A MODEST SHOP IN THE RUE RIVOLI BUT I COULD NOT SELL PENCILS ENOUGH TO PAY MY RENT WHEREAS BY ASSUMING THIS DISGUISE
4172-185480-0024 I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ATTRACTING GENERAL ATTENTION AND IN SELLING LITERALLY MILLIONS OF MY PENCILS AND I ASSURE YOU THERE IS AT THIS MOMENT SCARCELY AN ARTIST IN FRANCE OR IN GREAT BRITAIN
4172-185480-0025 WHO DON'T KNOW THAT I MANUFACTURE BY FAR THE BEST BLACKLEAD PENCILS EVER SEEN AND THIS ASSERTION WAS INDEED TRUE HIS PENCILS WERE EVERYWHERE ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE SUPERIOR TO ANY OTHER
4172-185480-0026 HE WOULD TAKE A BLANK CARD AND WITH ONE OF HIS PENCILS WOULD PRETEND TO BE DRAWING THE PORTRAIT OF SOME MAN STANDING NEAR HIM THEN SHOWING HIS PICTURE TO THE CROWD IT PROVED TO BE THE HEAD OF A DONKEY
4172-185480-0027 A HEARTY LAUGH WOULD BE SURE TO FOLLOW AND THEN HE WOULD EXCLAIM NOW WHO WILL HAVE THE FIRST PENCIL ONLY FIVE SOUS ONE WOULD BUY AND THEN ANOTHER A THIRD AND A FOURTH WOULD FOLLOW
4172-185480-0028 AND WITH THE DELIVERY OF EACH PENCIL HE WOULD RATTLE OFF A STRING OF WITTICISMS WHICH KEPT HIS PATRONS IN CAPITAL GOOD HUMOR AND FREQUENTLY HE WOULD SELL FROM TWO HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED PENCILS IN IMMEDIATE SUCCESSION
4172-185480-0029 THEN HE WOULD DROP DOWN IN HIS CARRIAGE FOR A FEW MINUTES AND WIPE THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FACE WHILE HIS SERVANT PLAYED ANOTHER OVERTURE ON THE ORGAN THIS GAVE HIS PURCHASERS A CHANCE TO WITHDRAW
4172-185480-0030 AND AFFORDED A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR A FRESH AUDIENCE TO CONGREGATE THEN WOULD FOLLOW A REPETITION OF HIS PREVIOUS SALES AND IN THIS WAY HE WOULD CONTINUE FOR HOURS
4172-185480-0031 TO THOSE DISPOSED TO HAVE A SOUVENIR OF THE GREAT HUMBUG HE WOULD SELL SIX PENCILS A MEDAL AND A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIMSELF FOR A FRANC TWENTY CENTS
4172-185480-0032 AFTER TAKING A REST HE WOULD COMMENCE A NEW SPEECH WHEN I WAS MODESTLY DRESSED LIKE ANY OF MY HEARERS
4172-185480-0033 PUNCH AND HIS BELLS WOULD ATTRACT CROWDS BUT MY GOOD PENCILS ATTRACTED NOBODY I IMITATED PUNCH AND HIS BELLS AND NOW I HAVE TWO HUNDRED DEPOTS IN PARIS I DINE AT THE BEST CAFES DRINK THE BEST WINE

4172-185480-0037 KNAVES FOR DESIRING THE PUBLIC'S MONEY WITHOUT GIVING THEM AN EQUIVALENT I AM AN HONEST MAN
4172-185480-0038 BY A PECULIAR PLAY OF FEATURE AND OF VOICE AND WITH UNIQUE AND ORIGINAL GESTURES WHICH SEEMED TO EXCITE AND CAPTIVATE HIS AUDIENCE ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO I MET HIM IN ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL RESTAURANTS IN THE PALAIS ROYALE

4172-185480-0047 KNOWS SOMETHING OF HUMAN NATURE MY IDEA IS
4172-185480-0048 BUT IT IS ONE GRAND SECRET
4172-185480-0049 ADD ANOTHER WRINKLE TO MY HORNS BUT POOR FELLOW WITHIN FOUR MONTHS AFTER I BADE HIM ADIEU THE PARIS NEWSPAPERS ANNOUNCED HIS SUDDEN DEATH THEY ADDED THAT HE HAD LEFT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS
4172-185480-0050 WHICH HE HAD GIVEN IN HIS WILL TO CHARITABLE OBJECTS THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS COPIED INTO NEARLY ALL THE PAPERS ON THE CONTINENT AND IN GREAT BRITAIN FOR ALMOST EVERYBODY HAD SEEN OR HEARD OF THE ECCENTRIC PENCIL MAKER
4172-185480-0051 HIS DEATH CAUSED MANY AN HONEST SIGH AND HIS ABSENCE SEEMED TO CAST A GLOOM OVER SEVERAL OF HIS FAVORITE HALTING PLACES THE PARISIANS REALLY LOVED HIM AND WERE PROUD OF HIS GENIUS
4172-185480-0052 HE WAS SHREWD AND POSSESSED A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD HE WAS A GENTLEMAN AND A MAN OF INTELLIGENCE EXTREMELY AGREEABLE AND WITTY HIS HABITS WERE GOOD HE WAS CHARITABLE HE NEVER CHEATED ANYBODY
4172-185480-0053 HE ALWAYS SOLD A GOOD ARTICLE AND NO PERSON WHO PURCHASED FROM HIM HAD CAUSE TO COMPLAIN I CONFESS I FELT SOMEWHAT CHAGRINED THAT THE MONSIEUR HAD THUS SUDDENLY TAKEN FRENCH LEAVE
4172-185480-0054 WITHOUT IMPARTING TO ME THE GRAND SECRET BY WHICH HE WAS TO DOUBLE THE SALES OF HIS PENCILS BUT I HAD NOT LONG TO MOURN ON THAT ACCOUNT
4172-185480-0055 AS THEY SAY OF JOHN BROWN MOULDERING IN HIS GRAVE JUDGE OF THE ASTONISHMENT AND DELIGHT OF ALL PARIS AT HIS REAPPEARANCE IN HIS NATIVE CITY IN PRECISELY THE SAME COSTUME AND CARRIAGE AS FORMERLY
4172-185480-0056 AND HERALDED BY THE SAME SERVANT AND ORGAN THAT HAD ALWAYS ATTENDED HIM
4172-185480-0057 AND THAT THE EXTENSIVELY CIRCULATED ANNOUNCEMENTS OF HIS SUDDEN DEATH HAD BEEN MADE BY HIMSELF MERELY AS AN ADVERTISING DODGE TO BRING HIM STILL MORE INTO NOTICE AND GIVE THE PUBLIC SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT
4172-185480-0058 AHA MONSIEUR BARNUM HE EXCLAIMED DID I NOT TELL YOU I HAD A NEW HUMBUG THAT WOULD DOUBLE THE SALES OF MY PENCILS I ASSURE YOU MY SALES ARE MORE THAN QUADRUPLED

4172-185480-0060 THE PATRONIZING AIR WITH WHICH HE MADE THIS SPEECH SLAPPING ME AT THE SAME TIME FAMILIARLY UPON THE BACK
