36-16603-0000 CHAPTER FOUR NO ONE WAS KINDER TO ME AT THAT TIME THAN ROSE WATERFORD SHE COMBINED A MASCULINE INTELLIGENCE WITH A FEMININE PERVERSITY AND THE NOVELS SHE WROTE WERE ORIGINAL AND DISCONCERTING
36-16603-0001 IT WAS AT HER HOUSE ONE DAY THAT I MET CHARLES STRICKLAND'S WIFE MISS WATERFORD WAS GIVING A TEA PARTY AND HER SMALL ROOM WAS MORE THAN USUALLY FULL EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE TALKING AND I SITTING IN SILENCE FELT AWKWARD BUT
36-16603-0002 ROSE WATERFORD CAST DOWN HER EYES DEMURELY TO GIVE GREATER EFFECT TO HER REPLY SHE GIVES LUNCHEON PARTIES
36-16603-0003 ROSE WATERFORD WAS A CYNIC SHE LOOKED UPON LIFE AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WRITING NOVELS AND THE PUBLIC AS HER RAW MATERIAL NOW AND THEN SHE INVITED MEMBERS OF IT TO HER HOUSE IF THEY SHOWED AN APPRECIATION OF HER TALENT
36-16603-0004 AND ENTERTAINED WITH PROPER LAVISHNESS SHE HELD THEIR WEAKNESS FOR LIONS IN GOOD HUMOURED CONTEMPT BUT PLAYED TO THEM HER PART OF THE DISTINGUISHED WOMAN OF LETTERS WITH DECORUM
36-16603-0005 I WAS LED UP TO MISSUS STRICKLAND AND FOR TEN MINUTES WE TALKED TOGETHER I NOTICED NOTHING ABOUT HER EXCEPT THAT SHE HAD A PLEASANT VOICE SHE HAD A FLAT IN WESTMINSTER OVERLOOKING THE UNFINISHED CATHEDRAL AND
36-16603-0006 BECAUSE WE LIVED IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD WE FELT FRIENDLY DISPOSED TO ONE ANOTHER THE ARMY AND NAVY STORES ARE A BOND OF UNION BETWEEN ALL WHO DWELL BETWEEN THE RIVER AND SAINT JAMES'S PARK
36-16603-0007 MISSUS STRICKLAND ASKED ME FOR MY ADDRESS AND A FEW DAYS LATER I RECEIVED AN INVITATION TO LUNCHEON MY ENGAGEMENTS WERE FEW AND I WAS GLAD TO ACCEPT
36-16603-0008 WHEN I ARRIVED A LITTLE LATE BECAUSE IN MY FEAR OF BEING TOO EARLY I HAD WALKED THREE TIMES ROUND THE CATHEDRAL I FOUND THE PARTY ALREADY COMPLETE MISS WATERFORD WAS THERE AND MISSUS JAY RICHARD TWINING AND GEORGE ROAD WE WERE ALL WRITERS
36-16603-0009 WE TALKED ABOUT A HUNDRED THINGS MISS WATERFORD TORN BETWEEN THE AESTHETICISM OF HER EARLY YOUTH WHEN SHE USED TO GO TO PARTIES IN SAGE GREEN HOLDING A DAFFODIL AND THE FLIPPANCY OF HER MATURER YEARS
36-16603-0010 WHICH TENDED TO HIGH HEELS AND PARIS FROCKS WORE A NEW HAT
36-16603-0011 MISSUS JAY AWARE THAT IMPROPRIETY IS THE SOUL OF WIT MADE OBSERVATIONS IN TONES HARDLY ABOVE A WHISPER THAT
36-16603-0012 RICHARD TWINING BUBBLED OVER WITH QUAINT ABSURDITIES AND GEORGE ROAD CONSCIOUS THAT HE NEED NOT EXHIBIT A BRILLIANCY WHICH WAS ALMOST A BY WORD OPENED HIS MOUTH ONLY TO PUT FOOD INTO IT
36-16603-0013 MISSUS STRICKLAND DID NOT TALK MUCH BUT SHE HAD A PLEASANT GIFT FOR KEEPING THE CONVERSATION GENERAL AND WHEN THERE WAS A PAUSE
36-16603-0014 SHE WAS A WOMAN OF THIRTY SEVEN RATHER TALL AND PLUMP WITHOUT BEING FAT
36-16603-0015 HER SKIN WAS RATHER SALLOW HER DARK HAIR WAS ELABORATELY DRESSED SHE WAS THE ONLY WOMAN OF THE THREE WHOSE FACE WAS FREE OF MAKE UP AND BY CONTRAST WITH THE OTHERS SHE SEEMED SIMPLE AND UNAFFECTED
36-16603-0016 THE DINING ROOM WAS IN THE GOOD TASTE OF THE PERIOD IT WAS VERY SEVERE
36-16603-0017 THE GREEN CURTAINS WITH THEIR PEACOCK DESIGN HUNG IN STRAIGHT LINES AND THE GREEN CARPET
36-16603-0018 LEAFY TREES SUGGESTED THE INFLUENCE OF WILLIAM MORRIS THERE WAS BLUE DELFT ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE AT THAT TIME THERE MUST HAVE BEEN FIVE HUNDRED DINING ROOMS IN LONDON DECORATED IN EXACTLY THE SAME MANNER IT WAS CHASTE ARTISTIC
36-16603-0019 AND DULL WHEN WE LEFT I WALKED AWAY WITH MISS WATERFORD AND THE FINE DAY AND HER NEW HAT PERSUADED US TO SAUNTER THROUGH THE PARK
36-16603-0020 DID YOU THINK THE FOOD WAS GOOD I TOLD HER THAT IF SHE WANTED WRITERS SHE MUST FEED THEM WELL ADMIRABLE ADVICE I ANSWERED BUT WHY DOES SHE WANT THEM MISS WATERFORD SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS SHE FINDS THEM AMUSING
36-16603-0021 SHE WANTS TO BE IN THE MOVEMENT I FANCY SHE'S RATHER SIMPLE POOR DEAR AND SHE THINKS WE'RE ALL WONDERFUL AFTER ALL IT PLEASES HER TO ASK US TO LUNCHEON AND IT DOESN'T HURT US I LIKE HER FOR IT
36-16603-0022 SHE HAD LED A VERY QUIET YOUTH IN THE COUNTRY AND THE BOOKS THAT CAME DOWN FROM MUDIE'S LIBRARY BROUGHT WITH THEM NOT ONLY THEIR OWN ROMANCE BUT THE ROMANCE OF LONDON SHE HAD A REAL PASSION FOR READING RARE IN HER KIND
36-16603-0023 WHO FOR THE MOST PART ARE MORE INTERESTED IN THE AUTHOR THAN IN HIS BOOK IN THE PAINTER THAN IN HIS PICTURES AND SHE INVENTED A WORLD OF THE IMAGINATION IN WHICH SHE LIVED WITH A FREEDOM SHE NEVER ACQUIRED IN THE WORLD OF EVERY DAY
36-16603-0024 WHEN SHE CAME TO KNOW WRITERS IT WAS LIKE ADVENTURING UPON A STAGE WHICH TILL THEN
36-16603-0025 SHE SAW THEM DRAMATICALLY AND REALLY SEEMED HERSELF TO LIVE A LARGER LIFE BECAUSE SHE ENTERTAINED THEM
36-16603-0026 NEVER FOR A MOMENT THOUGHT OF REGULATING HER OWN CONDUCT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEM THEIR MORAL ECCENTRICITIES LIKE THEIR ODDITIES OF DRESS THEIR WILD THEORIES AND PARADOXES WERE AN ENTERTAINMENT WHICH AMUSED HER
36-16603-0027 BUT HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST INFLUENCE ON HER CONVICTIONS IS THERE A MISTER STRICKLAND I ASKED OH YES HE'S SOMETHING IN THE CITY I BELIEVE HE'S A STOCKBROKER HE'S VERY DULL ARE THEY GOOD FRIENDS
36-16603-0028 BUT SHE DOESN'T OFTEN HAVE PEOPLE TO DINNER HE'S VERY QUIET HE'S NOT IN THE LEAST INTERESTED IN LITERATURE OR THE ARTS WHY DO NICE WOMEN MARRY DULL MEN BECAUSE INTELLIGENT MEN WON'T MARRY NICE WOMEN
36-16603-0029 I COULD NOT THINK OF ANY RETORT TO THIS SO I ASKED IF MISSUS STRICKLAND HAD CHILDREN YES SHE HAS A BOY AND A GIRL THEY'RE BOTH AT SCHOOL THE SUBJECT WAS EXHAUSTED AND WE BEGAN TO TALK OF OTHER THINGS
36-16603-0030 DURING THE SUMMER I MET MISSUS STRICKLAND NOT INFREQUENTLY I WENT NOW AND THEN TO PLEASANT LITTLE LUNCHEONS AT HER FLAT AND TO RATHER MORE FORMIDABLE TEA PARTIES WE TOOK A FANCY TO ONE ANOTHER
36-16603-0031 I WAS VERY YOUNG AND PERHAPS SHE LIKED THE IDEA OF GUIDING MY VIRGIN STEPS ON THE HARD ROAD OF LETTERS WHILE FOR ME IT WAS PLEASANT TO HAVE SOMEONE I COULD GO TO WITH MY SMALL TROUBLES CERTAIN OF AN ATTENTIVE EAR AND REASONABLE COUNSEL
36-16603-0032 MISSUS STRICKLAND HAD THE GIFT OF SYMPATHY IT IS A CHARMING FACULTY BUT ONE OFTEN ABUSED BY THOSE WHO ARE CONSCIOUS OF ITS POSSESSION FOR THERE IS SOMETHING GHOULISH IN THE AVIDITY WITH WHICH THEY WILL POUNCE UPON THE MISFORTUNE OF THEIR FRIENDS
36-16603-0033 SO THAT THEY MAY EXERCISE THEIR DEXTERITY IT GUSHES FORTH LIKE AN OIL WELL AND THE SYMPATHETIC POUR OUT THEIR SYMPATHY WITH AN ABANDON THAT IS SOMETIMES EMBARRASSING TO THEIR VICTIMS
36-16603-0034 MISSUS STRICKLAND USED HER ADVANTAGE WITH TACT YOU FELT THAT YOU OBLIGED HER BY ACCEPTING HER SYMPATHY WHEN IN THE ENTHUSIASM OF MY YOUTH I REMARKED ON THIS TO ROSE WATERFORD SHE SAID
36-16603-0035 ROSE WATERFORD HAD A BLISTERING TONGUE NO ONE COULD SAY SUCH BITTER THINGS ON THE OTHER HAND NO ONE COULD DO MORE CHARMING ONES THERE WAS ANOTHER THING I LIKED IN MISSUS STRICKLAND
36-16603-0036 SHE MANAGED HER SURROUNDINGS WITH ELEGANCE HER FLAT WAS ALWAYS NEAT AND CHEERFUL GAY WITH FLOWERS AND THE CHINTZES IN THE DRAWING ROOM NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR SEVERE DESIGN WERE BRIGHT AND PRETTY THE MEALS IN THE ARTISTIC LITTLE DINING ROOM WERE PLEASANT
36-16603-0037 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO SEE THAT MISSUS STRICKLAND WAS AN EXCELLENT HOUSEKEEPER AND YOU FELT SURE THAT SHE WAS AN ADMIRABLE MOTHER THERE WERE PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE DRAWING ROOM OF HER SON AND DAUGHTER THE SON HIS NAME WAS ROBERT
36-16603-0038 WAS A BOY OF SIXTEEN AT RUGBY
36-16603-0039 HE HAD HIS MOTHER'S CANDID BROW AND FINE REFLECTIVE EYES HE LOOKED CLEAN HEALTHY AND NORMAL I DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S VERY CLEVER SHE SAID ONE DAY WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE PHOTOGRAPH BUT I KNOW HE'S GOOD HE HAS A CHARMING CHARACTER
36-16603-0040 THE DAUGHTER WAS FOURTEEN HER HAIR THICK AND DARK LIKE HER MOTHER'S FELL OVER HER SHOULDERS IN FINE PROFUSION AND SHE HAD THE SAME KINDLY EXPRESSION AND SEDATE UNTROUBLED EYES
36-16603-0041 THEY'RE BOTH OF THEM THE IMAGE OF YOU I SAID YES I THINK THEY ARE MORE LIKE ME THAN THEIR FATHER WHY HAVE YOU NEVER LET ME MEET HIM I ASKED WOULD YOU LIKE TO
36-16603-0042 PERHAPS HER NAIVETE WAS HER GREATEST CHARM YOU KNOW HE'S NOT AT ALL LITERARY SHE SAID HE'S A PERFECT PHILISTINE
36-16603-0043 SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE ASPERSIONS OF HER FRIENDS HE'S ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE AND HE'S A TYPICAL BROKER I THINK HE'D BORE YOU TO DEATH DOES HE BORE YOU I ASKED YOU SEE I HAPPEN TO BE HIS WIFE
36-16603-0044 I'M VERY FOND OF HIM SHE SMILED TO COVER HER SHYNESS AND I FANCIED SHE HAD A FEAR THAT I WOULD MAKE THE SORT OF GIBE THAT SUCH A CONFESSION COULD HARDLY HAVE FAILED TO ELICIT FROM ROSE WATERFORD
36-16603-0045 SHE HESITATED A LITTLE HER EYES GREW TENDER HE DOESN'T PRETEND TO BE A GENIUS HE DOESN'T EVEN MAKE MUCH MONEY ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE BUT HE'S AWFULLY GOOD AND KIND
36-16603-0046 I THINK I SHOULD LIKE HIM VERY MUCH I'LL ASK YOU TO DINE WITH US QUIETLY SOME TIME BUT MIND YOU COME AT YOUR OWN RISK DON'T BLAME ME IF YOU HAVE A VERY DULL EVENING
36-16603-0047 BUT WHEN AT LAST I MET CHARLES STRICKLAND IT WAS UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ALLOWED ME TO DO NO MORE THAN JUST MAKE HIS ACQUAINTANCE ONE MORNING MISSUS STRICKLAND SENT ME ROUND A NOTE TO SAY THAT SHE WAS GIVING A DINNER PARTY THAT EVENING
36-16603-0048 AND ONE OF HER GUESTS HAD FAILED HER SHE ASKED ME TO STOP THE GAP SHE WROTE IT'S ONLY DECENT TO WARN YOU THAT YOU WILL BE BORED TO EXTINCTION IT WAS A THOROUGHLY DULL PARTY FROM THE BEGINNING BUT
36-16603-0049 IF YOU WILL COME I SHALL BE UNCOMMONLY GRATEFUL AND YOU AND I CAN HAVE A LITTLE CHAT BY OURSELVES IT WAS ONLY NEIGHBOURLY TO ACCEPT WHEN MISSUS STRICKLAND INTRODUCED ME TO HER HUSBAND HE GAVE ME A RATHER INDIFFERENT HAND TO SHAKE
36-16603-0050 TURNING TO HIM GAILY SHE ATTEMPTED A SMALL JEST I ASKED HIM TO SHOW HIM THAT I REALLY HAD A HUSBAND I THINK HE WAS BEGINNING TO DOUBT IT
36-16603-0051 STRICKLAND GAVE THE POLITE LITTLE LAUGH WITH WHICH PEOPLE ACKNOWLEDGE A FACETIOUSNESS IN WHICH THEY SEE NOTHING FUNNY BUT DID NOT SPEAK NEW ARRIVALS CLAIMED MY HOST'S ATTENTION AND I WAS LEFT TO MYSELF
36-16603-0052 WHEN AT LAST WE WERE ALL ASSEMBLED WAITING FOR DINNER TO BE ANNOUNCED I REFLECTED WHILE I CHATTED WITH THE WOMAN I HAD BEEN ASKED TO TAKE IN THAT CIVILISED MAN PRACTISES A STRANGE INGENUITY
36-16603-0053 IN WASTING ON TEDIOUS EXERCISES THE BRIEF SPAN OF HIS LIFE IT WAS THE KIND OF PARTY WHICH MAKES YOU WONDER WHY THE HOSTESS HAS TROUBLED TO BID HER GUESTS AND WHY THE GUESTS HAVE TROUBLED TO COME
36-16603-0054 THERE WERE TEN PEOPLE THEY MET WITH INDIFFERENCE AND WOULD PART WITH RELIEF IT WAS OF COURSE A PURELY SOCIAL FUNCTION THE STRICKLANDS OWED DINNERS TO A NUMBER OF PERSONS WHOM THEY TOOK NO INTEREST IN AND SO HAD ASKED THEM
36-16603-0055 THESE PERSONS HAD ACCEPTED WHY TO AVOID THE TEDIUM OF DINING TETE A TETE TO GIVE THEIR SERVANTS A REST BECAUSE THERE WAS NO REASON TO REFUSE BECAUSE THEY WERE OWED A DINNER
36-16603-0056 THE DINING ROOM WAS INCONVENIENTLY CROWDED THERE WAS A K C AND HIS WIFE A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AND HIS WIFE MISSUS STRICKLAND'S SISTER AND HER HUSBAND COLONEL MAC ANDREW AND THE WIFE OF A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
36-16603-0057 IT WAS BECAUSE THE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THAT I HAD BEEN INVITED THE RESPECTABILITY OF THE PARTY WAS PORTENTOUS THE WOMEN WERE TOO NICE TO BE WELL DRESSED AND TOO SURE OF THEIR POSITION TO BE AMUSING
36-16603-0058 THE MEN WERE SOLID THERE WAS ABOUT ALL OF THEM AN AIR OF WELL SATISFIED PROSPERITY EVERYONE TALKED A LITTLE LOUDER THAN NATURAL IN AN INSTINCTIVE DESIRE TO MAKE THE PARTY GO AND THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF NOISE IN THE ROOM
36-16603-0059 BUT THERE WAS NO GENERAL CONVERSATION EACH ONE TALKED TO HIS NEIGHBOUR TO HIS NEIGHBOUR ON THE RIGHT DURING THE SOUP FISH AND ENTREE TO HIS NEIGHBOUR ON THE LEFT DURING THE ROAST SWEET AND SAVOURY
36-16603-0060 THEY TALKED OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION AND OF GOLF OF THEIR CHILDREN AND THE LATEST PLAY OF THE PICTURES AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF THE WEATHER AND THEIR PLANS FOR THE HOLIDAYS
36-16603-0061 PERHAPS HE DID NOT TALK VERY MUCH AND I FANCIED THERE WAS TOWARDS THE END A LOOK OF FATIGUE IN THE FACES OF THE WOMEN ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THEY WERE FINDING HIM HEAVY
36-16603-0062 ONCE OR TWICE MISSUS STRICKLAND'S EYES RESTED ON HIM SOMEWHAT ANXIOUSLY AT LAST SHE ROSE AND SHEPHERDED THE LADIES OUT OF ONE ROOM
36-16603-0063 STRICKLAND SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND HER AND MOVING TO THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE TOOK HIS PLACE BETWEEN THE K C AND THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL HE PASSED ROUND THE PORT AGAIN AND HANDED US CIGARS THE K C REMARKED ON THE EXCELLENCE OF THE WINE AND STRICKLAND TOLD US WHERE HE GOT IT
36-16603-0064 WE BEGAN TO CHAT ABOUT VINTAGES AND TOBACCO THE K C TOLD US OF A CASE HE WAS ENGAGED IN AND THE COLONEL TALKED ABOUT POLO I HAD NOTHING TO SAY AND SO SAT SILENT TRYING POLITELY TO SHOW INTEREST IN THE CONVERSATION
36-16603-0065 AND BECAUSE I THOUGHT NO ONE WAS IN THE LEAST CONCERNED WITH ME EXAMINED STRICKLAND AT MY EASE HE WAS BIGGER THAN I EXPECTED I DO NOT KNOW WHY I HAD IMAGINED HIM SLENDER AND OF INSIGNIFICANT APPEARANCE
36-16603-0066 IN POINT OF FACT HE WAS BROAD AND HEAVY WITH LARGE HANDS AND FEET AND HE WORE HIS EVENING CLOTHES CLUMSILY HE GAVE YOU SOMEWHAT THE IDEA OF A COACHMAN DRESSED UP FOR THE OCCASION HE WAS A MAN OF FORTY
36-16603-0067 NOT GOOD LOOKING AND YET NOT UGLY FOR HIS FEATURES WERE RATHER GOOD
36-16603-0068 AND THE EFFECT WAS UNGAINLY HE WAS CLEAN SHAVEN AND HIS LARGE FACE LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLY NAKED HIS HAIR WAS REDDISH CUT VERY SHORT AND HIS EYES WERE SMALL BLUE OR GREY HE LOOKED COMMONPLACE
36-16603-0069 I NO LONGER WONDERED THAT MISSUS STRICKLAND FELT A CERTAIN EMBARRASSMENT ABOUT HIM HE WAS SCARCELY A CREDIT TO A WOMAN WHO WANTED TO MAKE HERSELF A POSITION IN THE WORLD OF ART AND LETTERS IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE HAD NO SOCIAL GIFTS BUT
36-16603-0070 THESE A MAN CAN DO WITHOUT HE HAD NO ECCENTRICITY EVEN
