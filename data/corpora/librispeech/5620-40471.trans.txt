5620-40471-0000 THE SUREST TIME OF YEAR TO FIND THE PILOTS AT HOME IS THE WINTER SEASON FOR THEN WITH NAVIGATION FROZEN UP THEY HAVE WEEKS TO SPEND DRIFTING ALONG IN THE SLEEPY VILLAGE LIFE WAITING FOR THE SPRING
5620-40471-0001 ONLY ALAS THE HEARTH IS A COMMONPLACE SHINY STOVE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT
5620-40471-0002 WE MAY HEAR BIG BAPTISTE
5620-40471-0003 SET IN DIGNITY AND FEATHERS
5620-40471-0004 THIS IS A TIME HONORED CUSTOM
5620-40471-0005 HE WILL GIVE US THE STORY TOO AMID NODS OF APPROVAL
5620-40471-0006 THERE SIR IS THE PADDLE HE USED IF YOU DOUBT THE TALE AND THE CANOE LIES OUT IN THE SNOW
5620-40471-0007 AND BE SURE WE SHALL NOT HAVE BEEN LONG IN CAUGHNAWAGA WITHOUT HEARING OF THE PROUD PART THESE INDIANS TOOK IN THE BRITISH EXPEDITION UP THE NILE IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR TO RELIEVE KHARTUM
5620-40471-0008 THEY HAVE ON MANY OCCASIONS SHOWN NOT ONLY GREAT SKILL BUT ALSO GREAT COURAGE IN NAVIGATING THEIR BOATS THROUGH DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS WATERS HOW MANY MEN DID CAUGHNAWAGA SEND ON THIS EXPEDITION I INQUIRED
5620-40471-0009 FIFTY FIVE MEN BESIDES LOUIS JACKSON SAID ONE OF THE INDIANS OH SAID I AND AND WHO IS LOUIS JACKSON THE INDIAN'S FACE SHOWED PLAIN DISGUST THAT THERE SHOULD BE ANY ONE WHO DID NOT KNOW ALL ABOUT LOUIS JACKSON LOUIS JACKSON WAS THE LEADER HE IS OUR CHIEF MAN HE LIVES OVER THERE
5620-40471-0010 BUT WE'VE GOT RAPIDS ALL AROUND HERE JUST PLAIN EVERY DAY RAPIDS THAT WILL MAKE THEIR CATARACTS LOOK SICK OF COURSE WE DID IT
5620-40471-0011 WHERE WAS OUR ARMY BACK IN ALEXANDRIA SIR AND IT MAKES A MAN SAD TO KNOW THAT THOSE BOYS IN KHARTUM WERE DYING JUST THEN
5620-40471-0012 THINK OF IT THE RELIEF PARTY REACHED KHARTUM ABOUT FEBRUARY FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE TOO LATE BY LESS THAN A WEEK KHARTUM HAD FALLEN KHARTUM SORE STRICKEN LAY IN FRESH SMOKING RUINS AND WHEN AT LAST BRITISH GUNBOATS FIRING AS THEY CAME
5620-40471-0013 GENERAL GORDON WAS DEAD CUT DOWN RUTHLESSLY BY THE ARABS A FEW DAYS BEFORE
5620-40471-0014 IT WOULD BE INTERESTING INDEED IF WE MIGHT HEAR THE WHOLE STORY OF THESE MONTHS SPENT IN FIGHTING A RIVER IN BATTLING WITH CATARACT AFTER CATARACT IN ROWING AND STEERING AND SAILING AND HAULING A FLEET OF BOATS AND SUPPLIES FOR AN ARMY UP UP
5620-40471-0015 UP INTO UNKNOWN RAPIDS THROUGH A BURNING DESERT SUCH A LONG LONG WAY IT WOULD BE AN INSPIRATION COULD WE KNOW IN DETAIL WHAT THESE PILOTS DID AND SUFFERED WHAT PERILS THEY DEFIED AND HOW SOME OF THEM PERISHED IN SHORT
5620-40471-0016 WHAT PROBLEMS OF THE RIVER THEY WENT AT AND HOW THEY FARED IN SOLVING THEM THAT WOULD MAKE A BOOK BY ITSELF A FEW THINGS WE MAY KNOW HOWEVER THIS FOR INSTANCE THAT WHILE THE MAPS PUT DOWN SIX CATARACTS IN THE NILE BETWEEN CAIRO AND KHARTUM
5620-40471-0017 SAY FIFTEEN HUNDRED MILES THERE ARE IN TRUTH MANY MORE THAN SIX BETWEEN THE SECOND AND THIRD ALONE THERE ARE MORE THAN SIX AND SOME OF THEM BAD
5620-40471-0018 AND THE DIFFICULT THING WAS TO REACH THE THIRD CATARACT AND UPON THIS ALL THE SKILL OF THE VOYAGEURS WAS CONCENTRATED THE FIRST CATARACT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILES ABOVE CAIRO IS FAIRLY EASY OF ASCENT THE SECOND CATARACT SOME TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FARTHER ON
5620-40471-0019 OR IN CASE OF NEED GIVE ONE SWIFT SEVERING HATCHET STROKE ON THE HAULING ROPE
5620-40471-0020 THE BLACK MEN HARNESSED ON AND THE RISK OF A NEW CHANNEL ENCOUNTERED AS BEFORE THUS DAYS OR WEEKS WOULD PASS IN GETTING THE WHALE BOATS UP A SINGLE CATARACT
5620-40471-0021 AND SOMETIMES THEY WOULD FACE THE STILL MORE FORMIDABLE TASK OF DRAGGING A WHOLE STEAMBOAT UP THE RAPIDS WITH TROOPS ABOARD AND STORES TO LAST FOR WEEKS THEN HOW THE HAULING MEN WOULD SWARM AT THE LINES
5620-40471-0022 UNTIL KNEES AND SHOULDERS SCRAPED THE GROUND
5620-40471-0023 AT LEAST IT SEEMED A MIRACLE THE DAY THEY STARTED THE BIG SIDE WHEELER NASSIF KHEIR UP THE SECOND CATARACT WITH FIVE HAWSERS ON HER
5620-40471-0024 AS HE HAD STEERED OTHER BOATS DOWN OTHER RAPIDS ON THE OLD SAINT LAWRENCE
