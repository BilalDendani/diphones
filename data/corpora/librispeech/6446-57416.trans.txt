6446-57416-0000 ONE PERDIX WHILE ATHENS WAS STILL ONLY A SMALL CITY THERE LIVED WITHIN ITS WALLS A MAN NAMED DAEDALUS WHO WAS THE MOST SKILLFUL WORKER IN WOOD AND STONE AND METAL THAT HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN
6446-57416-0001 IT WAS HE WHO TAUGHT THE PEOPLE HOW TO BUILD BETTER HOUSES AND HOW TO HANG THEIR DOORS ON HINGES AND HOW TO SUPPORT THE ROOFS WITH PILLARS AND POSTS HE WAS THE FIRST TO FASTEN THINGS TOGETHER WITH GLUE
6446-57416-0002 HE INVENTED THE PLUMB LINE AND THE AUGER AND HE SHOWED SEAMEN HOW TO PUT UP MASTS IN THEIR SHIPS AND HOW TO RIG THE SAILS TO THEM WITH ROPES
6446-57416-0003 DAEDALUS HAD A NEPHEW NAMED PERDIX WHOM HE HAD TAKEN WHEN A BOY TO TEACH THE TRADE OF BUILDER BUT PERDIX WAS A VERY APT LEARNER AND SOON SURPASSED HIS MASTER IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF MANY THINGS
6446-57416-0004 HIS EYES WERE EVER OPEN TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON ABOUT HIM AND HE LEARNED THE LORE OF THE FIELDS AND THE WOODS WALKING ONE DAY BY THE SEA HE PICKED UP THE BACKBONE OF A GREAT FISH AND FROM IT HE INVENTED THE SAW
6446-57416-0005 AND HE MADE OF A FORKED STICK THE FIRST PAIR OF COMPASSES FOR DRAWING CIRCLES AND HE STUDIED OUT MANY OTHER CURIOUS AND USEFUL THINGS DAEDALUS WAS NOT PLEASED WHEN HE SAW THAT THE LAD WAS SO APT AND WISE
6446-57416-0006 SO READY TO LEARN AND SO EAGER TO DO IF HE KEEPS ON IN THIS WAY HE MURMURED HE WILL BE A GREATER MAN THAN I HIS NAME WILL BE REMEMBERED AND MINE WILL BE FORGOTTEN DAY AFTER DAY WHILE AT HIS WORK
6446-57416-0007 WHICH HUNG HIGH OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROCKY CLIFF WHEREON THE TEMPLE STOOD THEN WHEN THE LAD OBEYED IT WAS EASY ENOUGH WITH A BLOW OF A HAMMER TO KNOCK THE SCAFFOLD FROM ITS FASTENINGS POOR PERDIX FELL HEADLONG THROUGH THE AIR
6446-57416-0008 AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN DASHED IN PIECES UPON THE STONES AT THE FOOT OF THE CLIFF HAD NOT KIND ATHENA SEEN HIM AND TAKEN PITY UPON HIM WHILE HE WAS YET WHIRLING THROUGH MID AIR SHE CHANGED HIM INTO A PARTRIDGE
6446-57416-0009 WHEN THE PEOPLE OF ATHENS HEARD OF HIS DASTARDLY DEED THEY WERE FILLED WITH GRIEF AND RAGE GRIEF FOR YOUNG PERDIX WHOM ALL HAD LEARNED TO LOVE RAGE TOWARDS THE WICKED UNCLE WHO LOVED ONLY HIMSELF
6446-57416-0010 KEEPING THE SHORE OF THE MAINLAND ALWAYS UPON THE RIGHT IT PASSED TROEZEN AND THE ROCKY COAST OF ARGOS AND THEN STRUCK BOLDLY OUT ACROSS THE SEA AT LAST THE FAMOUS ISLAND OF CRETE WAS REACHED
6446-57416-0011 AND THERE DAEDALUS LANDED AND MADE HIMSELF KNOWN AND THE KING OF CRETE WHO HAD ALREADY HEARD OF HIS WONDROUS SKILL WELCOMED HIM TO HIS KINGDOM AND GAVE HIM A HOME IN HIS PALACE
6446-57416-0012 AND PROMISED THAT HE SHOULD BE REWARDED WITH GREAT RICHES AND HONOR IF HE WOULD BUT STAY AND PRACTICE HIS CRAFT THERE AS HE HAD DONE IN ATHENS
6446-57416-0013 HIS GRANDFATHER WHOSE NAME WAS ALSO MINOS WAS THE SON OF EUROPA A YOUNG PRINCESS WHOM A WHITE BULL IT WAS SAID HAD BROUGHT ON HIS BACK ACROSS THE SEA FROM DISTANT ASIA
6446-57416-0014 SO WISE INDEED THAT JUPITER CHOSE HIM TO BE ONE OF THE JUDGES OF THE LOWER WORLD
6446-57416-0015 AND HE WAS BRAVE AND FAR SEEING AND SKILLED AS A RULER OF MEN HE HAD MADE ALL THE ISLANDS SUBJECT TO HIS KINGDOM AND HIS SHIPS SAILED INTO EVERY PART OF THE WORLD AND BROUGHT BACK TO CRETE
6446-57416-0016 AND THE FIERCE NATURE OF A MOUNTAIN LION THE PEOPLE OF CRETE WOULD NOT HAVE KILLED HIM IF THEY COULD FOR THEY THOUGHT THAT THE MIGHTY FOLK WHO LIVED WITH JUPITER ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP HAD SENT HIM AMONG THEM
6446-57416-0017 AND ALMOST EVERY DAY SOME MAN WOMAN OR CHILD WAS CAUGHT AND DEVOURED BY HIM YOU HAVE DONE SO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS SAID THE KING TO DAEDALUS CAN YOU NOT DO SOMETHING TO RID THE LAND OF THIS MINOTAUR
6446-57416-0018 VAINLY TRYING TO FIND SOME PLACE TO ESCAPE THREE ICARUS NOT LONG AFTER THIS IT HAPPENED THAT DAEDALUS WAS GUILTY OF A DEED WHICH ANGERED THE KING VERY GREATLY
6446-57416-0019 HE WOULD HAVE PUT HIM TO DEATH AND NO DOUBT HAVE SERVED HIM RIGHT HITHERTO SAID THE KING I HAVE HONORED YOU FOR YOUR SKILL AND REWARDED YOU FOR YOUR LABOR BUT NOW YOU SHALL BE MY SLAVE
6446-57416-0020 SO THAT HE COULD NOT ESCAPE BY SEA BUT ALTHOUGH THE WONDERFUL ARTISAN WAS THUS HELD AS A PRISONER HE DID NOT BUILD ANY MORE BUILDINGS FOR KING MINOS HE SPENT HIS TIME IN PLANNING HOW HE MIGHT REGAIN HIS FREEDOM
6446-57416-0021 ALL MY INVENTIONS HE SAID TO HIS SON ICARUS HAVE HITHERTO BEEN MADE TO PLEASE OTHER PEOPLE NOW I WILL INVENT SOMETHING TO PLEASE MYSELF SO ALL THROUGH THE DAY HE PRETENDED TO BE PLANNING SOME GREAT WORK FOR THE KING
6446-57416-0022 AND FOR ICARUS ANOTHER PAIR OF SMALLER ONES AND THEN ONE MIDNIGHT WHEN EVERYBODY WAS ASLEEP THE TWO WENT OUT TO SEE IF THEY COULD FLY THEY FASTENED THE WINGS TO THEIR SHOULDERS WITH WAX
6446-57416-0023 AND THEN HE AND ICARUS WENT OUT IN THE MOONLIGHT TO TRY THEM AGAIN THEY DID FINELY THIS TIME THEY FLEW UP TO THE TOP OF THE KING'S PALACE AND THEN THEY SAILED AWAY OVER THE WALLS OF THE CITY AND ALIGHTED ON THE TOP OF A HILL
6446-57416-0024 BUT THEY WERE NOT READY TO UNDERTAKE A LONG JOURNEY YET AND SO JUST BEFORE DAYBREAK THEY FLEW BACK HOME EVERY FAIR NIGHT AFTER THAT THEY PRACTICED WITH THEIR WINGS AND AT THE END OF A MONTH
6446-57416-0025 THEY FELT AS SAFE IN THE AIR AS ON THE GROUND AND COULD SKIM OVER THE HILLTOPS LIKE BIRDS
6446-57416-0026 THEY FASTENED ON THEIR WINGS SPRANG INTO THE AIR AND FLEW OUT OF THE CITY
6446-57416-0027 SKIMMING ALONG ONLY A LITTLE ABOVE THE WAVES AND HELPED ON THEIR WAY BY THE BRISK EAST WIND TOWARDS NOON THE SUN SHONE VERY WARM AND DAEDALUS CALLED OUT TO THE BOY WHO WAS A LITTLE BEHIND
6446-57416-0028 AND TOLD HIM TO KEEP HIS WINGS COOL AND NOT FLY TOO HIGH BUT THE BOY WAS PROUD OF HIS SKILL IN FLYING AND AS HE LOOKED UP AT THE SUN HE THOUGHT HOW NICE IT WOULD BE TO SOAR LIKE IT HIGH ABOVE THE CLOUDS IN THE BLUE DEPTHS OF THE SKY
