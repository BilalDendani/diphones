3845-176676-0000 BACK TO THE PASSING OF BOONE AND THE LANDING OF COLUMBUS NO MAN IN THAT REGION HAD EVER BEEN HANGED AND AS OLD JUDD SAID NO TOLLIVER HAD EVER BEEN SENTENCED AND NO JURY
3845-176676-0001 COULD BE FOUND WHO WOULD CONVICT A TOLLIVER FOR THERE WERE NO TWELVE MEN IN THE MOUNTAINS WHO WOULD DARE
3845-176676-0002 AND REST EASY BUT THEY DID NOT COUNT ON THE METTLE AND INTELLIGENCE OF THE GRIM YOUNG FURRINERS
3845-176676-0003 STRAIGHTWAY THEY GAVE UP THE PRACTICE OF LAW AND BANKING AND TRADING AND STORE KEEPING AND CUT PORT HOLES IN THE BRICK WALLS OF THE COURT HOUSE AND GUARDED TOWN AND JAIL NIGHT AND DAY THEY BROUGHT THEIR OWN FEARLESS JUDGE THEIR OWN FEARLESS JURY AND THEIR OWN FEARLESS GUARD
3845-176676-0004 THE MOUNTAINEER FINDS A HARD THING TO UNDERSTAND IT LOOKED AS THOUGH THE MOTIVE OF THE GUARD WAS VINDICTIVE AND PERSONAL AND OLD JUDD WAS ALMOST STIFLED BY THE VOLCANIC RAGE THAT DAILY GREW WITHIN HIM AS THE TOILS DAILY TIGHTENED ABOUT RUFE TOLLIVER
3845-176676-0005 EVERY HAPPENING THE OLD MAN LEARNED THROUGH THE RED FOX WHO WITH HIS HUGE PISTOLS WAS ONE OF THE MEN WHO ESCORTED RUFE TO AND FROM COURT HOUSE AND JAIL A VOLUNTEER HALE SUPPOSED BECAUSE HE HATED RUFE
3845-176676-0006 HE PRODUCED A WITNESS THE MOUNTAIN LOUT WHOM HALE REMEMBERED WHO ADMITTED THAT HE HAD BLOWN THE WHISTLE GIVEN THE YELL AND FIRED THE PISTOL SHOT WHEN ASKED HIS REASON THE WITNESS WHO WAS STUPID HAD NONE READY LOOKED HELPLESSLY AT RUFE
3845-176676-0007 AND FINALLY MUMBLED FER FUN BUT IT WAS PLAIN FROM THE QUESTIONS THAT RUFE HAD PUT TO HALE ONLY A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE SHOOTING AND FROM THE HESITATION OF THE WITNESS
3845-176676-0008 TO SURRENDER HAD FIRED FIRST CARRIED NO CONVICTION AND YET RUFE HAD NO TROUBLE MAKING IT ALMOST SURE THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN THE DEAD MAN BEFORE SO WHAT WAS HIS MOTIVE
3845-176676-0009 AND THAT SUITED HIS DARK PURPOSES WELL THAT VERY NIGHT WITH HIS BIG RIFLE HE SLIPPED THROUGH THE WOODS TO A TURN OF THE ROAD OVER WHICH OLD DAVE TOLLIVER WAS TO PASS NEXT MORNING
3845-176676-0010 AND BUILT A BLIND BEHIND SOME ROCKS AND LAY THERE SMOKING PEACEFULLY AND DREAMING HIS SWEDENBORGIAN DREAMS
3845-176676-0011 DRIVEN BY A BOY AND WITH THE GAUNT FRAME OF OLD DAVE TOLLIVER LYING ON STRAW IN THE BED OF IT HIS BIG RIFLE THUNDERED AND THE FRIGHTENED HORSES DASHED ON WITH THE RED FOX'S LAST ENEMY LIFELESS COOLLY HE SLIPPED BACK TO THE WOODS
