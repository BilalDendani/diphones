5082-16015-0000 COSETTE'S GRIEF WHICH HAD BEEN SO POIGNANT AND LIVELY FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS PREVIOUSLY HAD WITHOUT HER BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT ENTERED UPON ITS CONVALESCENCE NATURE SPRING YOUTH
5082-16015-0001 LOVE FOR HER FATHER THE GAYETY OF THE BIRDS AND FLOWERS CAUSED SOMETHING ALMOST RESEMBLING FORGETFULNESS TO FILTER GRADUALLY DROP BY DROP INTO THAT SOUL WHICH WAS SO VIRGIN AND SO YOUNG
5082-16015-0002 OR WAS IT MERELY THAT LAYERS OF ASHES HAD FORMED THE TRUTH IS THAT SHE HARDLY FELT THE PAINFUL AND BURNING SPOT ANY LONGER ONE DAY SHE SUDDENLY THOUGHT OF MARIUS
5082-16015-0003 WHY SAID SHE I NO LONGER THINK OF HIM THAT SAME WEEK SHE NOTICED A VERY HANDSOME OFFICER OF LANCERS WITH A WASP LIKE WAIST A DELICIOUS UNIFORM THE CHEEKS OF A YOUNG GIRL
5082-16015-0004 A SWORD UNDER HIS ARM WAXED MUSTACHES
5082-16015-0005 PASSING THE GATE MOREOVER HE HAD LIGHT HAIR PROMINENT BLUE EYES A ROUND FACE WAS VAIN INSOLENT AND GOOD LOOKING QUITE THE REVERSE OF MARIUS HE HAD A CIGAR IN HIS MOUTH
5082-16015-0006 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY SHE SAW HIM PASS AGAIN SHE TOOK NOTE OF THE HOUR FROM THAT TIME FORTH WAS IT CHANCE SHE SAW HIM PASS NEARLY EVERY DAY
5082-16015-0007 THE OFFICER'S COMRADES PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS IN THAT BADLY KEPT GARDEN BEHIND THAT MALICIOUS ROCOCO FENCE A VERY PRETTY CREATURE WHO WAS ALMOST ALWAYS THERE WHEN THE HANDSOME LIEUTENANT
5082-16015-0008 PASSED BY SEE HERE THEY SAID TO HIM
5082-16015-0009 TO LOOK AT ALL THE GIRLS WHO LOOK AT ME THIS WAS AT THE PRECISE MOMENT WHEN MARIUS WAS DESCENDING HEAVILY TOWARDS AGONY AND WAS SAYING
5082-16015-0010 DIE HAD HIS WISH BEEN REALIZED HAD HE BEHELD COSETTE AT THAT MOMENT GAZING AT THE LANCER HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO UTTER A WORD AND HE WOULD HAVE EXPIRED WITH GRIEF WHOSE FAULT WAS IT NO ONE'S
5082-16015-0011 MARIUS POSSESSED ONE OF THOSE TEMPERAMENTS WHICH BURY THEMSELVES IN SORROW AND THERE ABIDE COSETTE WAS ONE OF THOSE PERSONS WHO PLUNGE INTO SORROW AND EMERGE FROM IT AGAIN COSETTE WAS MOREOVER PASSING THROUGH THAT DANGEROUS PERIOD
5082-16015-0012 THE FATAL PHASE OF FEMININE REVERY ABANDONED TO ITSELF IN WHICH THE ISOLATED HEART OF A YOUNG GIRL RESEMBLES THE TENDRILS OF THE VINE WHICH CLING AS CHANCE DIRECTS TO THE CAPITAL OF A MARBLE COLUMN OR TO THE POST OF A WINE SHOP A RAPID AND DECISIVE MOMENT
5082-16015-0013 CRITICAL FOR EVERY ORPHAN BE SHE RICH OR POOR FOR WEALTH DOES NOT PREVENT A BAD CHOICE MISALLIANCES ARE MADE IN VERY HIGH CIRCLES REAL MISALLIANCE IS THAT OF SOULS AND AS MANY AN UNKNOWN YOUNG MAN WITHOUT NAME WITHOUT BIRTH WITHOUT FORTUNE
5082-16015-0014 SO SUCH AND SUCH A MAN OF THE WORLD SATISFIED AND OPULENT WHO HAS POLISHED BOOTS AND VARNISHED WORDS IF LOOKED AT NOT OUTSIDE BUT INSIDE A THING WHICH IS RESERVED FOR HIS WIFE
5082-16015-0015 IS NOTHING MORE THAN A BLOCK OBSCURELY HAUNTED BY VIOLENT UNCLEAN AND VINOUS PASSIONS THE POST OF A DRINKING SHOP WHAT DID COSETTE'S SOUL CONTAIN
5082-16015-0016 SOMETHING LIMPID BRILLIANT
5082-16015-0017 LOWER DOWN THE IMAGE OF THE HANDSOME OFFICER WAS REFLECTED IN THE SURFACE DID A SOUVENIR LINGER IN THE DEPTHS QUITE AT THE BOTTOM POSSIBLY
5082-16015-0018 COSETTE'S APPREHENSIONS DURING THE FIRST FORTNIGHT IN APRIL JEAN VALJEAN TOOK A JOURNEY THIS AS THE READER KNOWS HAPPENED FROM TIME TO TIME AT VERY LONG INTERVALS HE REMAINED ABSENT A DAY OR TWO DAYS AT THE UTMOST
5082-16015-0019 WHERE DID HE GO NO ONE KNEW NOT EVEN COSETTE ONCE ONLY ON THE OCCASION OF ONE OF THESE DEPARTURES SHE HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM IN A HACKNEY COACH AS FAR AS A LITTLE BLIND ALLEY AT THE CORNER OF WHICH SHE READ IMPASSE DE LA PLANCHETTE
5082-16015-0020 THERE HE ALIGHTED AND THE COACH TOOK COSETTE BACK TO THE RUE DE BABYLONE IT WAS USUALLY WHEN MONEY WAS LACKING IN THE HOUSE THAT JEAN VALJEAN TOOK THESE LITTLE TRIPS SO JEAN VALJEAN WAS ABSENT HE HAD SAID
5082-16015-0021 I SHALL RETURN IN THREE DAYS THAT EVENING COSETTE WAS ALONE IN THE DRAWING ROOM
5082-16015-0022 SHE HAD OPENED HER PIANO ORGAN AND HAD BEGUN TO SING ACCOMPANYING HERSELF THE WHILE THE CHORUS FROM EURYANTHE HUNTERS ASTRAY IN THE WOOD WHICH IS PROBABLY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING IN ALL THE SPHERE OF MUSIC WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE REMAINED
5082-16015-0023 WRAPPED IN THOUGHT ALL AT ONCE IT SEEMED TO HER
5082-16015-0024 IT COULD NOT BE HER FATHER HE WAS ABSENT IT COULD NOT BE TOUSSAINT SHE WAS IN BED AND IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT SHE STEPPED TO THE SHUTTER OF THE DRAWING ROOM WHICH WAS CLOSED AND LAID HER EAR AGAINST IT IT SEEMED TO HER THAT IT WAS THE TREAD OF A MAN
5082-16015-0025 AND THAT HE WAS WALKING VERY SOFTLY SHE MOUNTED RAPIDLY TO THE FIRST FLOOR TO HER OWN CHAMBER OPENED A SMALL WICKET IN HER SHUTTER AND PEEPED INTO THE GARDEN THE MOON WAS AT THE FULL EVERYTHING COULD BE SEEN AS PLAINLY AS BY DAY
5082-16015-0026 THERE WAS NO ONE THERE SHE OPENED THE WINDOW THE GARDEN WAS ABSOLUTELY CALM AND ALL THAT WAS VISIBLE WAS THAT THE STREET WAS DESERTED AS USUAL COSETTE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
5082-16015-0027 WHICH LAYS OPEN BEFORE THE MIND TERRIFIED DEPTHS WHICH TREMBLES BEFORE THE GAZE LIKE A DIZZY FOREST
5082-16015-0028 OF WHOM ONE CATCHES A GLIMPSE THROUGH THE TWILIGHT SHE THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT IT MOREOVER COSETTE WAS NOT VERY TIMID BY NATURE THERE FLOWED IN HER VEINS SOME OF THE BLOOD OF THE BOHEMIAN AND THE ADVENTURESS WHO RUNS BAREFOOT
5082-16015-0029 IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT SHE WAS MORE OF A LARK THAN A DOVE THERE WAS A FOUNDATION OF WILDNESS AND BRAVERY IN HER ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AT AN EARLIER HOUR TOWARDS NIGHTFALL SHE WAS STROLLING IN THE GARDEN IN THE MIDST OF THE CONFUSED THOUGHTS
5082-16015-0030 WHICH OCCUPIED HER SHE FANCIED THAT SHE CAUGHT FOR AN INSTANT A SOUND SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE PRECEDING EVENING AS THOUGH SOME ONE WERE WALKING BENEATH THE TREES IN THE DUSK AND NOT VERY FAR FROM HER
5082-16015-0031 BUT SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT NOTHING SO CLOSELY RESEMBLES A STEP ON THE GRASS AS THE FRICTION OF TWO BRANCHES WHICH HAVE MOVED FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND SHE PAID NO HEED TO IT BESIDES SHE COULD SEE NOTHING SHE EMERGED FROM THE THICKET
5082-16015-0032 SHE HAD STILL TO CROSS A SMALL LAWN TO REGAIN THE STEPS THE MOON WHICH HAD JUST RISEN BEHIND HER CAST COSETTE'S SHADOW IN FRONT OF HER UPON THIS LAWN AS SHE CAME OUT FROM THE SHRUBBERY COSETTE HALTED IN ALARM
5082-16015-0033 A FEW PACES IN THE REAR OF COSETTE SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT WITHOUT THE POWER TO SPEAK OR CRY OR CALL OR STIR OR TURN HER HEAD THEN SHE SUMMONED UP ALL HER COURAGE AND TURNED ROUND RESOLUTELY
5082-16015-0034 THERE WAS NO ONE THERE SHE GLANCED ON THE GROUND THE FIGURE HAD DISAPPEARED SHE RE ENTERED THE THICKET SEARCHED THE CORNERS BOLDLY WENT AS FAR AS THE GATE AND FOUND NOTHING SHE FELT HERSELF ABSOLUTELY CHILLED WITH TERROR
5082-16015-0035 WAS THIS ANOTHER HALLUCINATION WHAT TWO DAYS IN SUCCESSION ONE HALLUCINATION MIGHT PASS BUT TWO HALLUCINATIONS THE DISQUIETING POINT ABOUT IT WAS THAT THE SHADOW HAD ASSUREDLY NOT BEEN A PHANTOM
5082-16015-0036 PHANTOMS DO NOT WEAR ROUND HATS ON THE FOLLOWING DAY JEAN VALJEAN RETURNED COSETTE TOLD HIM WHAT SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD HEARD AND SEEN SHE WANTED TO BE REASSURED AND TO SEE HER FATHER SHRUG HIS SHOULDERS AND SAY TO HER
5082-16015-0037 YOU ARE A LITTLE GOOSE JEAN VALJEAN GREW ANXIOUS
5082-16015-0038 HE LEFT HER UNDER SOME PRETEXT AND WENT INTO THE GARDEN AND SHE SAW HIM EXAMINING THE GATE WITH GREAT ATTENTION DURING THE NIGHT SHE WOKE UP THIS TIME SHE WAS SURE AND SHE DISTINCTLY HEARD SOME ONE WALKING CLOSE TO THE FLIGHT OF STEPS BENEATH HER WINDOW
5082-16015-0039 IN POINT OF FACT THERE WAS A MAN IN THE GARDEN WITH A LARGE CLUB IN HIS HAND JUST AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO SCREAM
5082-16015-0040 IT WAS HER FATHER SHE RETURNED TO HER BED SAYING TO HERSELF
5082-16015-0041 JEAN VALJEAN PASSED THAT NIGHT AND THE TWO SUCCEEDING NIGHTS IN THE GARDEN COSETTE SAW HIM THROUGH THE HOLE IN HER SHUTTER ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE MOON WAS ON THE WANE AND HAD BEGUN TO RISE LATER AT ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING POSSIBLY
5082-16015-0042 SHE JUMPED OUT OF BED THREW ON HER DRESSING GOWN AND OPENED HER WINDOW HER FATHER WAS STANDING ON THE GRASS PLOT BELOW I HAVE WAKED YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF REASSURING YOU SAID HE LOOK THERE IS YOUR SHADOW WITH THE ROUND HAT
5082-16015-0043 AND HE POINTED OUT TO HER ON THE TURF A SHADOW CAST BY THE MOON AND WHICH DID INDEED BEAR CONSIDERABLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE SPECTRE OF A MAN WEARING A ROUND HAT IT WAS THE SHADOW PRODUCED BY A CHIMNEY PIPE OF SHEET IRON WITH A HOOD
5082-16015-0044 WHICH ROSE ABOVE A NEIGHBORING ROOF COSETTE JOINED IN HIS LAUGHTER ALL HER LUGUBRIOUS SUPPOSITIONS WERE ALLAYED AND THE NEXT MORNING AS SHE WAS AT BREAKFAST WITH HER FATHER SHE MADE MERRY OVER THE SINISTER GARDEN
5082-16015-0045 JEAN VALJEAN BECAME QUITE TRANQUIL ONCE MORE AS FOR COSETTE SHE DID NOT PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THE QUESTION WHETHER THE CHIMNEY POT WAS REALLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SHADOW WHICH SHE HAD SEEN OR THOUGHT SHE HAD SEEN AND WHETHER THE MOON HAD BEEN IN THE SAME SPOT IN THE SKY
5082-16015-0046 SHE DID NOT QUESTION HERSELF AS TO THE PECULIARITY OF A CHIMNEY POT WHICH IS AFRAID OF BEING CAUGHT IN THE ACT AND WHICH RETIRES WHEN SOME ONE LOOKS AT ITS SHADOW
5082-16015-0047 WHEN COSETTE HAD TURNED ROUND AND COSETTE HAD THOUGHT HERSELF VERY SURE OF THIS COSETTE'S SERENITY WAS FULLY RESTORED THE PROOF APPEARED TO HER TO BE COMPLETE AND IT QUITE VANISHED FROM HER MIND
