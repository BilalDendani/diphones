948-132710-0000 THE BOOK FELL FROM MY HANDS AND I WEPT I WHO HAD NEVER KNOWN TEARS I WEPT IN DELIVERANCE AND IN PITY FOR ALL MANKIND
948-132710-0001 I UNDERSTOOD THE BLESSED THING WHICH I HAD CALLED MY CURSE I UNDERSTOOD WHY THE BEST IN ME
948-132710-0002 AND MY TRANSGRESSIONS AND WHY I HAD NEVER FELT GUILT IN MY SINS I UNDERSTOOD THAT CENTURIES OF CHAINS AND LASHES WILL NOT KILL THE SPIRIT OF MAN NOR THE SENSE OF TRUTH WITHIN HIM
948-132710-0003 I READ MANY BOOKS FOR MANY DAYS THEN I CALLED THE GOLDEN ONE AND I TOLD HER WHAT I HAD READ AND WHAT I HAD LEARNED SHE LOOKED AT ME AND THE FIRST WORDS SHE SPOKE WERE I LOVE YOU
948-132710-0004 I HAVE READ OF A MAN WHO LIVED MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO AND OF ALL THE NAMES IN THESE BOOKS HIS IS THE ONE I WISH TO BEAR
948-132710-0005 AND I HAVE READ OF A GODDESS I SAID WHO WAS THE MOTHER OF THE EARTH AND OF ALL THE GODS HER NAME WAS GAEA LET THIS BE YOUR NAME MY GOLDEN ONE FOR YOU ARE TO BE THE MOTHER OF A NEW KIND OF GODS
948-132710-0006 AS THE HEIR OF ALL THE SAINTS AND ALL THE MARTYRS WHO CAME BEFORE HIM AND WHO DIED FOR THE SAME CAUSE FOR THE SAME WORD NO MATTER WHAT NAME THEY GAVE TO THEIR CAUSE AND THEIR TRUTH
948-132710-0007 I SHALL LIVE HERE IN MY OWN HOUSE I SHALL TAKE MY FOOD FROM THE EARTH BY THE TOIL OF MY OWN HANDS I SHALL LEARN MANY SECRETS FROM MY BOOKS THROUGH THE YEARS AHEAD I SHALL REBUILD THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PAST
948-132710-0008 AND OPEN THE WAY TO CARRY THEM FURTHER THE ACHIEVEMENTS WHICH ARE OPEN TO ME BUT CLOSED FOREVER TO MY BROTHERS FOR THEIR MINDS ARE SHACKLED TO THE WEAKEST
948-132710-0009 THEY CALLED IT ELECTRICITY IT WAS THE POWER THAT MOVED THEIR GREATEST INVENTIONS
948-132710-0010 I HAVE FOUND THE ENGINE WHICH PRODUCED THIS LIGHT I SHALL LEARN HOW TO REPAIR IT AND HOW TO MAKE IT WORK AGAIN I SHALL LEARN HOW TO USE THE WIRES WHICH CARRY THIS POWER THEN I SHALL BUILD A BARRIER OF WIRES AROUND MY HOME
948-132710-0011 AND ACROSS THE PATHS WHICH LEAD TO MY HOME A BARRIER LIGHT AS A COBWEB MORE IMPASSABLE THAN A WALL OF GRANITE A BARRIER MY BROTHERS WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO CROSS
948-132710-0012 WHEN I SHALL HAVE READ ALL THE BOOKS AND LEARNED MY NEW WAY WHEN MY HOME WILL BE READY AND MY EARTH TILLED I SHALL STEAL ONE DAY FOR THE LAST TIME
948-132710-0013 WHO HAS NO NAME SAVE INTERNATIONAL
948-132710-0014 AND ALL THOSE LIKE HIM FRATERNITY
948-132710-0015 WHO CRIES WITHOUT REASON AND SOLIDARITY
948-132710-0016 WHO CALLS FOR HELP IN THE NIGHT AND A FEW OTHERS I SHALL CALL TO ME
948-132710-0017 HAS NOT BEEN KILLED WITHIN THEM AND WHO SUFFER UNDER THE YOKE OF THEIR BROTHERS THEY WILL FOLLOW ME AND I SHALL LEAD THEM TO MY FORTRESS AND HERE IN THIS UNCHARTED WILDERNESS I
948-132710-0018 AND THEY MY CHOSEN FRIENDS MY FELLOW BUILDERS SHALL WRITE THE FIRST CHAPTER IN THE NEW HISTORY OF MAN
948-132710-0019 AND AS I STAND HERE AT THE DOOR OF GLORY I LOOK BEHIND ME FOR THE LAST TIME I LOOK UPON THE HISTORY OF MEN WHICH I HAVE LEARNED FROM THE BOOKS AND I WONDER IT WAS A LONG STORY
948-132710-0020 AND THE SPIRIT WHICH MOVED IT WAS THE SPIRIT OF MAN'S FREEDOM BUT WHAT IS FREEDOM FREEDOM FROM WHAT THERE IS NOTHING TO TAKE A MAN'S FREEDOM AWAY FROM HIM SAVE OTHER MEN
948-132710-0021 HE DECLARED TO ALL HIS BROTHERS THAT A MAN HAS RIGHTS WHICH NEITHER GOD NOR KING NOR OTHER MEN CAN TAKE AWAY FROM HIM NO MATTER WHAT THEIR NUMBER
948-132710-0022 IS THE RIGHT OF MAN AND THERE IS NO RIGHT ON EARTH ABOVE THIS RIGHT
948-132710-0023 BUT THEN HE GAVE UP ALL HE HAD WON AND FELL LOWER THAN HIS SAVAGE BEGINNING WHAT BROUGHT IT TO PASS WHAT DISASTER
948-132710-0024 TOOK THEIR REASON AWAY FROM MEN WHAT WHIP LASHED THEM TO THEIR KNEES IN SHAME AND SUBMISSION THE WORSHIP OF THE WORD WE WHEN MEN ACCEPTED THAT WORSHIP
948-132710-0025 THE STRUCTURE OF CENTURIES COLLAPSED ABOUT THEM THE STRUCTURE WHOSE EVERY BEAM HAD COME FROM THE THOUGHT OF SOME ONE MAN EACH IN HIS DAY DOWN THE AGES FROM THE DEPTH OF SOME ONE SPIRIT
948-132710-0026 BUT FOR ITS OWN SAKE THOSE MEN WHO SURVIVED THOSE EAGER TO OBEY EAGER TO LIVE FOR ONE ANOTHER SINCE THEY HAD NOTHING ELSE TO VINDICATE THEM THOSE MEN COULD NEITHER CARRY ON NOR PRESERVE WHAT THEY HAD RECEIVED
948-132710-0027 THUS DID ALL THOUGHT ALL SCIENCE ALL WISDOM PERISH ON EARTH THUS DID MEN
948-132710-0028 THE STEEL TOWERS THE FLYING SHIPS THE POWER WIRES ALL THE THINGS THEY
948-132710-0029 PERHAPS LATER SOME MEN HAD BEEN BORN WITH THE MIND AND THE COURAGE TO RECOVER THESE THINGS WHICH WERE LOST
948-132710-0030 AND FOR THE SAME REASONS BUT I STILL WONDER HOW IT WAS POSSIBLE IN THOSE GRACELESS YEARS OF TRANSITION LONG AGO THAT MEN DID NOT SEE WHITHER THEY WERE GOING AND WENT ON
948-132710-0031 IN BLINDNESS AND COWARDICE TO THEIR FATE I WONDER FOR IT IS HARD FOR ME TO CONCEIVE HOW MEN WHO KNEW THE WORD I COULD GIVE IT UP
948-132710-0032 BUT SUCH HAS BEEN THE STORY
948-132710-0033 WHAT AGONY MUST HAVE BEEN THEIRS BEFORE THAT WHICH THEY SAW COMING AND COULD NOT STOP PERHAPS THEY CRIED OUT IN PROTEST AND IN WARNING BUT MEN PAID NO HEED TO THEIR WARNING AND THEY
948-132710-0034 FOUGHT A HOPELESS BATTLE AND THEY PERISHED WITH THEIR BANNERS SMEARED BY THEIR OWN BLOOD AND THEY CHOSE TO PERISH FOR THEY KNEW TO THEM I SEND MY SALUTE ACROSS THE CENTURIES AND MY PITY
948-132710-0035 THAT THE DESPAIR OF THEIR HEARTS WAS NOT TO BE FINAL AND THEIR NIGHT WAS NOT WITHOUT HOPE FOR THE BATTLE THEY LOST CAN NEVER BE LOST FOR THAT WHICH THEY DIED TO SAVE
948-132710-0036 CAN NEVER PERISH THROUGH ALL THE DARKNESS THROUGH ALL THE SHAME OF WHICH MEN ARE CAPABLE THE SPIRIT OF MAN WILL REMAIN ALIVE ON THIS EARTH IT MAY SLEEP BUT IT WILL AWAKEN
948-132710-0037 IT MAY WEAR CHAINS BUT IT WILL BREAK THROUGH AND MAN WILL GO ON MAN NOT MEN HERE ON THIS MOUNTAIN
948-132710-0038 I AND MY SONS AND MY CHOSEN FRIENDS SHALL BUILD OUR NEW LAND AND OUR FORT AND IT WILL BECOME AS THE HEART OF THE EARTH LOST AND HIDDEN AT FIRST BUT BEATING
948-132710-0039 BEATING LOUDER EACH DAY AND WORD OF IT WILL REACH EVERY CORNER OF THE EARTH AND THE ROADS OF THE WORLD WILL BECOME AS VEINS WHICH WILL CARRY THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S BLOOD TO MY THRESHOLD
948-132710-0040 AND ALL MY BROTHERS AND THE COUNCILS OF MY BROTHERS WILL HEAR OF IT BUT THEY WILL BE IMPOTENT AGAINST ME AND THE DAY WILL COME
948-132710-0041 AND MY HOME WILL BECOME THE CAPITAL OF A WORLD WHERE EACH MAN WILL BE FREE TO EXIST FOR HIS OWN SAKE
948-132710-0042 THE WORD WHICH CAN NEVER DIE ON THIS EARTH FOR IT IS THE HEART OF IT AND THE MEANING AND THE GLORY
