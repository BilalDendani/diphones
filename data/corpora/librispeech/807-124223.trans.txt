807-124223-0000 FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS BILL SURNAME UNKNOWN WAS NOT ONE OF YOUR ULTRA SCIENTIFIC FIGHTERS HE DID NOT FAVOUR THE AMERICAN CROUCH AND THE ARTISTIC FEINT HE HAD A STYLE WHOLLY HIS OWN
807-124223-0001 AND PARTLY ON A WINDMILL HIS HEAD HE APPEARED TO BE TRYING TO CONCEAL BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS AND HE WHIRLED HIS ARMS ALTERNATELY IN CIRCULAR SWEEPS MIKE ON THE OTHER HAND STOOD UPRIGHT AND HIT STRAIGHT
807-124223-0002 WITH THE RESULT THAT HE HURT HIS KNUCKLES VERY MUCH ON HIS OPPONENT'S SKULL WITHOUT SEEMING TO DISTURB THE LATTER TO ANY GREAT EXTENT IN THE PROCESS HE RECEIVED ONE OF THE WINDMILL SWINGS ON THE LEFT EAR
807-124223-0003 RAISED A CHEER THIS MADDENED MIKE
807-124223-0004 BILL SATISFIED FOR THE MOMENT WITH HIS SUCCESS HAD STEPPED BACK AND WAS INDULGING IN SOME FANCY SPARRING WHEN MIKE SPRANG UPON HIM LIKE A PANTHER THEY CLINCHED AND MIKE WHO HAD GOT THE UNDER GRIP HURLED BILL FORCIBLY AGAINST A STOUT MAN WHO LOOKED LIKE A PUBLICAN
807-124223-0005 THE TWO FELL IN A HEAP BILL UNDERNEATH AT THE SAME TIME BILL'S FRIENDS JOINED IN THE FIRST INTIMATION MIKE HAD OF THIS WAS A VIOLENT BLOW ACROSS THE SHOULDERS WITH A WALKING STICK EVEN IF HE HAD BEEN WEARING HIS OVERCOAT THE BLOW WOULD HAVE HURT
807-124223-0006 AS HE WAS IN HIS JACKET IT HURT MORE THAN ANYTHING HE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED IN HIS LIFE HE LEAPT UP WITH A YELL BUT PSMITH WAS THERE BEFORE HIM MIKE SAW HIS ASSAILANT LIFT THE STICK AGAIN AND THEN COLLAPSE AS THE OLD ETONIAN'S RIGHT TOOK HIM UNDER THE CHIN
807-124223-0007 HE DARTED TO PSMITH'S SIDE THIS IS NO PLACE FOR US OBSERVED THE LATTER SADLY SHIFT HO I THINK COME ON THEY DASHED SIMULTANEOUSLY FOR THE SPOT WHERE THE CROWD WAS THINNEST THE RING WHICH HAD FORMED ROUND MIKE AND BILL HAD BROKEN UP AS THE RESULT OF THE INTERVENTION
807-124223-0008 OF BILL'S ALLIES AND AT THE SPOT FOR WHICH THEY RAN ONLY TWO MEN WERE STANDING AND THESE HAD APPARENTLY MADE UP THEIR MINDS THAT NEUTRALITY WAS THE BEST POLICY FOR THEY MADE NO MOVEMENT TO STOP THEM PSMITH AND MIKE CHARGED THROUGH THE GAP AND RACED FOR THE ROAD
807-124223-0009 THE SUDDENNESS OF THE MOVE GAVE THEM JUST THE START THEY NEEDED MIKE LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER THE CROWD TO A MAN SEEMED TO BE FOLLOWING BILL EXCAVATED FROM BENEATH THE PUBLICAN LED THE FIELD LYING A GOOD SECOND CAME A BAND OF THREE
807-124223-0010 AND AFTER THEM THE REST IN A BUNCH THEY REACHED THE ROAD IN THIS ORDER SOME FIFTY YARDS DOWN THE ROAD WAS A STATIONARY TRAM IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF THINGS IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE MOVED ON LONG BEFORE PSMITH AND MIKE COULD HAVE GOT TO IT
807-124223-0011 BUT THE CONDUCTOR A MAN WITH SPORTING BLOOD IN HIM SEEING WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE FINISH OF SOME MARATHON RACE REFRAINED FROM GIVING THE SIGNAL AND MOVED OUT INTO THE ROAD TO OBSERVE EVENTS MORE CLEARLY AT THE SAME TIME CALLING TO THE DRIVER WHO JOINED HIM
807-124223-0012 THERE WAS SOME CHEERING PSMITH AND MIKE REACHED THE TRAM TEN YARDS TO THE GOOD AND IF IT HAD BEEN READY TO START THEN ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL BUT BILL AND HIS FRIENDS HAD ARRIVED WHILE THE DRIVER AND CONDUCTOR WERE BOTH OUT IN THE ROAD
807-124223-0013 THE AFFAIR NOW BEGAN TO RESEMBLE THE DOINGS OF HORATIUS ON THE BRIDGE PSMITH AND MIKE TURNED TO BAY ON THE PLATFORM AT THE FOOT OF THE TRAM STEPS
807-124223-0014 PSMITH DESCENDING WITH A DIGNITY SOMEWHAT LESSENED BY THE FACT THAT HIS HAT WAS ON THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD WAS IN TIME TO ENGAGE THE RUNNERS UP
807-124223-0015 BUT HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY EFFECTIVE NATURE HAD GIVEN HIM AN ENORMOUS REACH AND A LIGHTNESS ON HIS FEET REMARKABLE IN ONE OF HIS SIZE AND AT SOME TIME IN HIS CAREER HE APPEARED TO HAVE LEARNED HOW TO USE HIS HANDS THE FIRST OF THE THREE RUNNERS THE WALKING STICK MANIPULATOR
807-124223-0016 HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO CHARGE STRAIGHT INTO THE OLD ETONIAN'S LEFT IT WAS A WELL TIMED BLOW AND THE FORCE OF IT ADDED TO THE SPEED AT WHICH THE VICTIM WAS RUNNING SENT HIM ON TO THE PAVEMENT WHERE HE SPUN ROUND AND SAT DOWN IN THE SUBSEQUENT PROCEEDINGS HE TOOK NO PART
807-124223-0017 ONE ON EACH SIDE IN DOING SO THE ONE ON THE LEFT TRIPPED OVER MIKE AND BILL
807-124223-0018 AND FELL LEAVING PSMITH FREE TO ATTEND TO THE OTHER HE WAS A TALL WEEDY YOUTH HIS CONSPICUOUS FEATURES WERE A LONG NOSE AND A LIGHT YELLOW WAISTCOAT PSMITH HIT HIM ON THE FORMER WITH HIS LEFT AND ON THE LATTER WITH HIS RIGHT THE LONG YOUTH EMITTED A GURGLE AND COLLIDED WITH BILL
807-124223-0019 BILL HAVING RECEIVED A SECOND BLOW IN THE EYE DURING THE COURSE OF HIS INTERVIEW ON THE ROAD WITH MIKE WAS NOT FEELING HIMSELF MISTAKING THE OTHER FOR AN ENEMY HE PROCEEDED TO SMITE HIM IN THE PARTS ABOUT THE JAW HE HAD JUST UPSET HIM WHEN A STERN OFFICIAL VOICE OBSERVED ERE NOW
807-124223-0020 WHAT'S ALL THIS THERE IS NO MORE UNFAILING CORRECTIVE TO A SCENE OF STRIFE THAN THE WHAT'S ALL THIS OF THE LONDON POLICEMAN BILL ABANDONED HIS INTENTION OF STAMPING ON THE PROSTRATE ONE AND THE LATTER SITTING UP BLINKED AND WAS SILENT WHAT'S ALL THIS ASKED THE POLICEMAN AGAIN
807-124223-0021 PSMITH ADJUSTING HIS HAT AT THE CORRECT ANGLE AGAIN UNDERTOOK THE EXPLANATIONS A DISTRESSING SCENE OFFICER HE SAID A CASE OF THAT UNBRIDLED BRAWLING WHICH IS ALAS BUT TOO COMMON IN OUR LONDON STREETS
807-124223-0022 FALL OUT OVER SOME POINT PROBABLY OF THE MOST TRIVIAL NATURE AND WHAT HAPPENS THEY BRAWL THEY HE IT ME SAID THE LONG YOUTH DABBING AT HIS FACE WITH A HANDKERCHIEF
807-124223-0023 WHO REGARDED HIM THROUGH HIS EYEGLASS WITH A LOOK IN WHICH PITY AND CENSURE WERE NICELY BLENDED BILL MEANWHILE CIRCLING ROUND RESTLESSLY IN THE APPARENT HOPE OF GETTING PAST THE LAW AND HAVING ANOTHER ENCOUNTER WITH MIKE
807-124223-0024 EXPRESSED HIMSELF IN A STREAM OF LANGUAGE WHICH DREW STERN REPROOF FROM THE SHOCKED CONSTABLE YOU OP IT CONCLUDED THE MAN IN BLUE THAT'S WHAT YOU DO YOU OP IT I SHOULD SAID PSMITH KINDLY
807-124223-0025 A MAN OF TASTE AND DISCERNMENT HE KNOWS WHAT IS BEST HIS ADVICE IS GOOD AND SHOULD BE FOLLOWED THE CONSTABLE SEEMED TO NOTICE PSMITH FOR THE FIRST TIME HE TURNED AND STARED AT HIM PSMITH'S PRAISE HAD NOT HAD THE EFFECT OF SOFTENING HIM HIS LOOK WAS ONE OF SUSPICION
807-124223-0026 AND WHAT MIGHT YOU HAVE BEEN UP TO HE INQUIRED COLDLY THIS MAN SAYS YOU HIT HIM PSMITH WAVED THE MATTER ASIDE PURELY IN SELF DEFENCE HE SAID PURELY IN SELF DEFENCE WHAT ELSE COULD THE MAN OF SPIRIT DO
807-124223-0027 A MERE TAP TO DISCOURAGE AN AGGRESSIVE MOVEMENT THE POLICEMAN STOOD SILENT WEIGHING MATTERS IN THE BALANCE HE PRODUCED A NOTEBOOK AND SUCKED HIS PENCIL
807-124223-0028 A BRAINY AND ADMIRABLE STEP SAID PSMITH APPROVINGLY THIS RUGGED HONEST MAN ALL UNUSED TO VERBAL SUBTLETIES SHALL GIVE US HIS PLAIN ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENED AFTER WHICH AS I PRESUME THIS TRAM LITTLE AS I KNOW OF THE HABITS OF TRAMS
807-124223-0029 HAS GOT TO GO SOMEWHERE TODAY I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE ALL SEPARATED AND MOVED ON HE TOOK TWO HALF CROWNS FROM HIS POCKET AND BEGAN TO CLINK THEM MEDITATIVELY TOGETHER A SLIGHT SOFTENING OF THE FRIGIDITY OF THE CONSTABLE'S MANNER BECAME NOTICEABLE
807-124223-0030 THERE WAS A MILDER BEAM IN THE EYES WHICH GAZED INTO PSMITH'S NOR DID THE CONDUCTOR SEEM ALTOGETHER UNINFLUENCED BY THE SIGHT
807-124223-0031 SEEING AS HOW HE'D HUNG ABART LONG ENOUGH WHEN HE SEE'D
807-124223-0032 HE ADDED THAT WHEN THEY REACHED THE TREM THE TWO GENTS HAD GOT ABOARD AND WAS THEN SET UPON BY THE BLOKES
807-124223-0033 AND THAT'S HOW IT WAS LUCIDLY AND EXCELLENTLY PUT SAID PSMITH
807-124223-0034 COMRADE JACKSON I FANCY WE LEAVE THE COURT WITHOUT A STAIN ON OUR CHARACTERS WE WIN THROUGH ER CONSTABLE WE HAVE GIVEN YOU A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE POSSIBLY THANK YOU SIR THERE WAS A MUSICAL CLINKING NOW THEN ALL OF YOU YOU OP IT
807-124223-0035 GET ON WITH THAT TRAM CONDUCTOR PSMITH AND MIKE SETTLED THEMSELVES IN A SEAT ON THE ROOF
807-124223-0036 AND ASKED AFTER HIS WIFE AND THE LITTLE ONES AT HOME THE CONDUCTOR THANKED GOODNESS THAT HE WAS A BACHELOR PUNCHED THE TICKETS AND RETIRED SUBJECT FOR A HISTORICAL PICTURE SAID PSMITH WOUNDED LEAVING THE FIELD AFTER THE BATTLE OF CLAPHAM COMMON
807-124223-0037 HOW ARE YOUR INJURIES COMRADE JACKSON MY BACK'S HURTING LIKE BLAZES SAID MIKE AND MY EAR'S ALL SORE WHERE THAT CHAP GOT ME ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH YOU PHYSICALLY SAID PSMITH NO SPIRITUALLY MUCH DO YOU REALIZE COMRADE JACKSON THE THING THAT HAS HAPPENED
807-124223-0038 IF THIS SHOULD GET ABOUT THE CLUBS I TELL YOU COMRADE JACKSON NO SUCH CRISIS HAS EVER OCCURRED BEFORE IN THE COURSE OF MY CAREER YOU CAN ALWAYS GET OFF YOU KNOW SAID MIKE HE THINKS OF EVERYTHING SAID PSMITH ADMIRINGLY YOU HAVE TOUCHED THE SPOT WITH AN UNERRING FINGER
807-124223-0039 LET US DESCEND I OBSERVE IN THE DISTANCE A CAB THAT LOOKS TO ME MORE THE SORT OF THING WE WANT
807-124223-0040 SUNDAY SUPPER THE CAB TOOK THEM BACK TO THE FLAT AT CONSIDERABLE EXPENSE AND PSMITH REQUESTED MIKE TO MAKE TEA A PERFORMANCE IN WHICH HE HIMSELF WAS INTERESTED PURELY AS A SPECTATOR
807-124223-0041 BUT HE NEVER GOT FURTHER THAN THIS MIKE HIS BACK THROBBING DULLY FROM THE BLOW HE HAD RECEIVED AND FEELING MORE THAN A LITTLE SORE ALL OVER PREPARED THE ETNA FETCHED THE MILK AND FINALLY PRODUCED THE FINISHED ARTICLE PSMITH SIPPED MEDITATIVELY
807-124223-0042 HOW PLEASANT HE SAID AFTER STRIFE IS REST WE SHOULDN'T HAVE APPRECIATED THIS SIMPLE CUP OF TEA HAD OUR SENSIBILITIES REMAINED UNSTIRRED THIS AFTERNOON
807-124223-0043 MIKE LOOKED UP WHAT YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU'RE GOING TO SWEAT OUT TO CLAPHAM AGAIN UNDOUBTEDLY COMRADE WALLER IS EXPECTING US TO SUPPER WHAT ABSOLUTE ROT WE CAN'T FAG BACK THERE NOBLESSE OBLIGE
807-124223-0044 THE CRY HAS GONE ROUND THE WALLER HOUSEHOLD JACKSON AND PSMITH ARE COMING TO SUPPER AND WE CANNOT DISAPPOINT THEM NOW ALREADY THE FATTED BLANC MANGE HAS BEEN KILLED AND THE TABLE CREAKS BENEATH WHAT'S LEFT OF THE MIDDAY BEEF
807-124223-0045 PROBABLY WE SHALL FIND HIM IN THE ACT OF EMITTING HIS LAST BREATH
807-124223-0046 NOT MUCH GRINNED MIKE THEY WERE TOO BUSY WITH US ALL RIGHT
807-124223-0047 BUT IT'S AWFUL ROT ONE OF THE MANY THINGS MIKE COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IN PSMITH WAS HIS FONDNESS FOR GETTING INTO ATMOSPHERES THAT WERE NOT HIS OWN HE WOULD GO OUT OF HIS WAY TO DO THIS MIKE LIKE MOST BOYS OF HIS AGE
807-124223-0048 WAS NEVER REALLY HAPPY AND AT HIS EASE EXCEPT IN THE PRESENCE OF THOSE OF HIS OWN YEARS AND CLASS PSMITH ON THE CONTRARY SEEMED TO BE BORED BY THEM AND INFINITELY PREFERRED TALKING TO SOMEBODY WHO LIVED IN QUITE ANOTHER WORLD MIKE WAS NOT A SNOB
807-124223-0049 HE SIMPLY HAD NOT THE ABILITY TO BE AT HIS EASE WITH PEOPLE IN ANOTHER CLASS FROM HIS OWN HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT UNLESS THEY WERE CRICKET PROFESSIONALS
807-124223-0050 BUT PSMITH WAS DIFFERENT HE COULD GET ON WITH ANYONE HE SEEMED TO HAVE THE GIFT OF ENTERING INTO THEIR MINDS AND SEEING THINGS FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW AS REGARDED MISTER WALLER MIKE LIKED HIM PERSONALLY AND WAS PREPARED AS WE HAVE SEEN
807-124223-0051 TO UNDERTAKE CONSIDERABLE RISKS IN HIS DEFENCE BUT HE LOATHED WITH ALL HIS HEART AND SOUL THE IDEA OF SUPPER AT HIS HOUSE HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO SAY WHEREAS PSMITH GAVE HIM THE IMPRESSION OF LOOKING FORWARD TO THE THING AS A TREAT
807-124223-0052 THE DOOR WAS OPENED TO THEM BY THEIR HOST HIMSELF SO FAR FROM LOOKING BATTERED AND EMITTING LAST BREATHS HE APPEARED PARTICULARLY SPRUCE HE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM CHURCH AND WAS STILL WEARING HIS GLOVES AND TALL HAT HE SQUEAKED WITH SURPRISE WHEN HE SAW WHO WERE STANDING ON THE MAT
807-124223-0053 I WAS AFRAID THOSE RUFFIANS MIGHT HAVE INJURED YOU
807-124223-0054 CHIVVIED INTERPOSED PSMITH WITH DIGNIFIED MELANCHOLY
807-124223-0055 WE WERE BEING CHIVVIED WE WERE LEGGING IT WITH THE INFURIATED MOB AT OUR HEELS AN IGNOMINIOUS POSITION FOR A SHROPSHIRE PSMITH BUT AFTER ALL NAPOLEON DID THE SAME BUT WHAT HAPPENED I COULD NOT SEE
807-124223-0056 I ONLY KNOW THAT QUITE SUDDENLY THE PEOPLE SEEMED TO STOP LISTENING TO ME AND ALL GATHERED ROUND YOU AND JACKSON AND THEN I SAW THAT JACKSON WAS ENGAGED IN A FIGHT WITH A YOUNG MAN COMRADE JACKSON I IMAGINE HAVING HEARD A GREAT DEAL ABOUT ALL MEN BEING EQUAL WAS ANXIOUS TO TEST THE THEORY
807-124223-0057 AND SEE WHETHER COMRADE BILL WAS AS GOOD A MAN AS HE WAS THE EXPERIMENT WAS BROKEN OFF PREMATURELY BUT I PERSONALLY SHOULD BE INCLINED TO SAY THAT COMRADE JACKSON HAD A SHADE THE BETTER OF THE EXCHANGES
807-124223-0058 MISTER WALLER LOOKED WITH INTEREST AT MIKE WHO SHUFFLED AND FELT AWKWARD HE WAS HOPING THAT PSMITH WOULD SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE REASON OF HIS ENGAGING BILL IN COMBAT
807-124223-0059 WOULD BE EFFUSIVE AND OVERPOWERING AND HE DID NOT WISH TO POSE AS THE BRAVE YOUNG HERO THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN ONE DOES NOT FEEL EQUAL TO THE ROLE FORTUNATELY BEFORE MISTER WALLER HAD TIME TO ASK ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS THE SUPPER BELL SOUNDED AND THEY WENT INTO THE DINING ROOM
807-124223-0060 SUNDAY SUPPER UNLESS DONE ON A LARGE AND INFORMAL SCALE IS PROBABLY THE MOST DEPRESSING MEAL IN EXISTENCE THERE IS A CHILL DISCOMFORT IN THE ROUND OF BEEF AN ICY SEVERITY ABOUT THE OPEN JAM TART THE BLANCMANGE SHIVERS MISERABLY
807-124223-0061 AND SO DOES EXHILARATING CONVERSATION UNFORTUNATELY AT MISTER WALLER'S TABLE THERE WAS NEITHER THE CASHIER'S VIEWS ON TEMPERANCE WERE NOT MERELY FOR THE PLATFORM THEY EXTENDED TO THE HOME AND THE COMPANY WAS NOT OF THE EXHILARATING SORT
807-124223-0062 THERE WERE FOUR PEOPLE PRESENT COMRADE PREBBLE THE ORATOR A YOUNG MAN OF THE NAME OF RICHARDS MISTER WALLER'S NIECE
807-124223-0063 WHO WAS ENGAGED TO MISTER RICHARDS AND EDWARD
807-124223-0064 HE WAS TEN YEARS OLD WORE A VERY TIGHT ETON SUIT AND HAD THE PECULIARLY LOATHSOME EXPRESSION WHICH A SNUB NOSE SOMETIMES GIVES TO THE YOUNG IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PLAIN TO THE MOST CASUAL OBSERVER THAT MISTER WALLER WAS FOND AND PROUD OF HIS SON
807-124223-0065 THE CASHIER WAS A WIDOWER AND AFTER FIVE MINUTES ACQUAINTANCE WITH EDWARD MIKE FELT STRONGLY THAT MISSUS WALLER WAS THE LUCKY ONE EDWARD SAT NEXT TO MIKE AND SHOWED A TENDENCY TO CONCENTRATE HIS CONVERSATION ON HIM
807-124223-0066 PSMITH AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE TABLE BEAMED IN A FATHERLY MANNER UPON THE PAIR THROUGH HIS EYEGLASS MIKE GOT ON WITH SMALL GIRLS REASONABLY WELL HE PREFERRED THEM AT A DISTANCE BUT IF CORNERED BY THEM COULD PUT UP A FAIRLY GOOD SHOW SMALL BOYS HOWEVER FILLED HIM WITH A SORT OF FROZEN HORROR
807-124223-0067 IT WAS HIS VIEW THAT A BOY SHOULD NOT BE EXHIBITED PUBLICLY UNTIL HE REACHED AN AGE WHEN HE MIGHT BE IN THE RUNNING FOR SOME SORT OF COLOURS AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL EDWARD WAS ONE OF THOSE WELL INFORMED SMALL BOYS HE OPENED ON MIKE WITH THE FIRST MOUTHFUL
807-124223-0068 WHAT SAID MIKE COLDLY DO YOU KNOW THE PRINCIPAL EXPORTS OF MARSEILLES I DO OH SAID MIKE YES DO YOU KNOW THE CAPITAL OF MADAGASCAR MIKE AS CRIMSON AS THE BEEF HE WAS ATTACKING SAID HE DID NOT I DO
807-124223-0069 OH SAID MIKE WHO WAS THE FIRST KING YOU MUSTN'T WORRY MISTER JACKSON TEDDY
807-124223-0070 AS WHO SHOULD SAY THERE ARE NOT MANY BOYS OF HIS AGE I CAN TELL YOU WHO COULD WORRY YOU WITH QUESTIONS LIKE THAT
807-124223-0071 ACROSS THE DINNER TABLE I OWE MUCH OF MY OWN GRASP OF I BET YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S THE CAPITAL OF MADAGASCAR INTERRUPTED MIKE RUDELY I DO SAID EDWARD I CAN TELL YOU THE KINGS OF ISRAEL HE ADDED TURNING TO MIKE
807-124223-0072 MIKE'S APPEARED TO FASCINATE HIM MIKE HELPED HIMSELF TO BEETROOT IN MOODY SILENCE HIS MOUTH WAS FULL WHEN COMRADE PREBBLE ASKED HIM A QUESTION
807-124223-0073 WAS A GOOD CHAP BUT HAD NO ROOF TO HIS MOUTH I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID MIKE COMRADE PREBBLE REPEATED HIS OBSERVATION MIKE LOOKED HELPLESSLY AT PSMITH BUT PSMITH'S EYES WERE ON HIS PLATE MIKE FELT HE MUST VENTURE ON SOME ANSWER NO HE SAID DECIDEDLY
807-124223-0074 COMRADE PREBBLE SEEMED SLIGHTLY TAKEN ABACK THERE WAS AN AWKWARD PAUSE THEN MISTER WALLER FOR WHOM HIS FELLOW SOCIALIST'S METHODS OF CONVERSATION HELD NO MYSTERIES INTERPRETED THE MUSTARD PREBBLE YES YES WOULD YOU MIND PASSING PREBBLE THE MUSTARD MISTER JACKSON
807-124223-0075 OH SORRY GASPED MIKE AND REACHING OUT UPSET THE WATER JUG INTO THE OPEN JAM TART THROUGH THE BLACK MIST WHICH ROSE BEFORE HIS EYES AS HE LEAPED TO HIS FEET AND STAMMERED APOLOGIES CAME THE DISPASSIONATE VOICE OF MASTER EDWARD WALLER
807-124223-0076 REMINDING HIM THAT MUSTARD WAS FIRST INTRODUCED INTO PERU BY CORTEZ HIS HOST WAS ALL COURTESY AND CONSIDERATION HE PASSED THE MATTER OFF GENIALLY
807-124223-0077 AT THE TABLE OF A COMPARATIVE STRANGER MIKE'S NERVE HAD GONE HE ATE ON BUT HE WAS A BROKEN MAN AT THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE IT BECAME GRADUALLY APPARENT THAT THINGS WERE NOT GOING ON ALTOGETHER AS THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE THERE WAS A SORT OF BLEAKNESS IN THE ATMOSPHERE
807-124223-0078 YOUNG MISTER RICHARDS WAS LOOKING LIKE A STUFFED FISH AND THE FACE OF MISTER WALLER'S NIECE WAS COLD AND SET WHY COME COME ADA SAID MISTER WALLER BREEZILY
807-124223-0079 WHAT'S GEORGE BEEN SAYING TO YOU HE ADDED JOCULARLY
807-124223-0080 THERE'S NOTHING THE MATTER NOTHING THAT MISTER RICHARDS CAN SAY TO ME CAN UPSET ME MISTER RICHARDS ECHOED MISTER WALLER IN ASTONISHMENT HOW WAS HE TO KNOW THAT DURING THE WALK BACK FROM CHURCH THE WORLD HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED GEORGE HAD BECOME MISTER RICHARDS AND ALL WAS OVER
807-124223-0081 I ASSURE YOU ADA BEGAN THAT UNFORTUNATE YOUNG MAN ADA TURNED A FRIGID SHOULDER TOWARDS HIM COME COME SAID MISTER WALLER DISTURBED WHAT'S ALL THIS WHAT'S ALL THIS HIS NIECE BURST INTO TEARS AND LEFT THE ROOM
807-124223-0082 WE HAVE YET TO HEAR OF IT MIKE SCARLET TO THE EXTREME EDGES OF HIS EARS CONCENTRATED HIMSELF ON HIS PLATE COMRADE PREBBLE MADE A GREAT MANY REMARKS WHICH WERE PROBABLY ILLUMINATING IF THEY COULD HAVE BEEN UNDERSTOOD MISTER WALLER LOOKED ASTONISHED AT MISTER RICHARDS
807-124223-0083 MISTER RICHARDS PINK BUT DOGGED LOOSENED HIS COLLAR BUT SAID NOTHING PSMITH LEANING FORWARD ASKED MASTER EDWARD WALLER HIS OPINION ON THE LICENSING BILL WE HAPPENED TO HAVE A WORD OR TWO SAID MISTER RICHARDS AT LENGTH
807-124223-0084 ON THE WAY HOME FROM CHURCH ON THE SUBJECT OF WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE THAT FATAL TOPIC MURMURED PSMITH IN AUSTRALIA BEGAN MASTER EDWARD WALLER I WAS RAYTHER WELL RAYTHER FACETIOUS ABOUT IT CONTINUED MISTER RICHARDS PSMITH CLICKED HIS TONGUE SYMPATHETICALLY
807-124223-0085 I WENT TALKING ON LAUGHING AND JOKING WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE FLEW OUT AT ME
807-124223-0086 HOW VERY DISTURBING SAID MISTER WALLER
807-124223-0087 SHE IN AUSTRALIA SAID EDWARD IN EVEN TONES THEY'VE GOT WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE ALREADY DID YOU KNOW THAT HE SAID TO MIKE MIKE MADE NO ANSWER HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON HIS PLATE A BEAD OF PERSPIRATION BEGAN TO ROLL DOWN HIS FOREHEAD
807-124223-0088 IF HIS FEELINGS COULD HAVE BEEN ASCERTAINED AT THAT MOMENT
807-124223-0089 DEATH WHERE IS THY STING
807-124223-0090 PSMITH MAKES A DISCOVERY WOMEN SAID PSMITH HELPING HIMSELF TO TRIFLE AND SPEAKING WITH THE AIR OF ONE LAUNCHED UPON HIS SPECIAL SUBJECT ARE ONE MUST RECOLLECT LIKE
807-124223-0091 PASSING ON LIGHTLY FROM THAT CONCLUSION LET US TURN FOR A MOMENT TO THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY IN CONNECTION WITH WHICH COMRADE PREBBLE AND YOURSELF HAD SO MUCH THAT WAS INTERESTING TO SAY THIS AFTERNOON
807-124223-0092 HE BOWED IN COMRADE PREBBLE'S DIRECTION
807-124223-0093 BUT EARNEST YOUR VERY LUCID COMRADE PREBBLE BEAMED AND TOOK THE FLOOR MIKE BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT TILL NOW HE HAD NEVER KNOWN WHAT BOREDOM MEANT THERE HAD BEEN MOMENTS IN HIS LIFE WHICH HAD BEEN LESS INTERESTING THAN OTHER MOMENTS
807-124223-0094 BUT NOTHING TO TOUCH THIS FOR AGONY COMRADE PREBBLE'S ADDRESS STREAMED ON LIKE WATER RUSHING OVER A WEIR EVERY NOW AND THEN THERE WAS A WORD OR TWO WHICH WAS RECOGNIZABLE BUT THIS HAPPENED SO RARELY THAT IT AMOUNTED TO LITTLE
807-124223-0095 SOMETIMES MISTER WALLER WOULD INTERJECT A REMARK BUT NOT OFTEN HE SEEMED TO BE OF THE OPINION THAT COMRADE PREBBLE'S WAS THE MASTER MIND AND THAT TO ADD ANYTHING TO HIS VIEWS WOULD BE IN THE NATURE OF PAINTING THE LILY AND GILDING THE REFINED GOLD MIKE HIMSELF SAID NOTHING
807-124223-0096 PSMITH AND EDWARD WERE EQUALLY SILENT THE FORMER SAT LIKE ONE IN A TRANCE THINKING HIS OWN THOUGHTS WHILE EDWARD WHO PROSPECTING ON THE SIDEBOARD
807-124223-0097 AFTER ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES DURING WHICH MIKE'S DISCOMFORT CHANGED TO A DULL RESIGNATION MISTER WALLER SUGGESTED A MOVE TO THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE ADA HE SAID WOULD PLAY SOME HYMNS THE PROSPECT DID NOT DAZZLE MIKE BUT ANY CHANGE HE THOUGHT MUST BE FOR THE BETTER
807-124223-0098 THAT IT HAD BEGUN TO HYPNOTIZE HIM ALSO THE MOVE HAD THE EXCELLENT RESULT OF ELIMINATING THE SNUB NOSED EDWARD WHO WAS SENT TO BED HIS LAST WORDS WERE IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION ADDRESSED TO MIKE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE HYPOTENUSE AND THE SQUARE UPON THE SAME
807-124223-0099 AT OUR FLAT ONE DAY I MAY NOT BE IN MYSELF I HAVE MANY DUTIES WHICH KEEP ME AWAY BUT COMRADE JACKSON IS SURE TO BE THERE AND WILL BE DELIGHTED TO CHAT WITH HIM ON THE WAY UPSTAIRS MIKE TRIED TO GET PSMITH TO HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT TO SUGGEST THE ADVISABILITY OF AN EARLY DEPARTURE
807-124223-0100 BUT PSMITH WAS IN CLOSE CONVERSATION WITH HIS HOST MIKE WAS LEFT TO COMRADE PREBBLE WHO APPARENTLY HAD ONLY TOUCHED THE FRINGE OF HIS SUBJECT IN HIS LECTURE IN THE DINING ROOM WHEN MISTER WALLER HAD PREDICTED HYMNS IN THE DRAWING ROOM HE HAD BEEN TOO SANGUINE OR TOO PESSIMISTIC
807-124223-0101 OF ADA WHEN THEY ARRIVED THERE WERE NO SIGNS IT SEEMED THAT SHE HAD GONE STRAIGHT TO BED YOUNG MISTER RICHARDS WAS SITTING ON THE SOFA MOODILY TURNING THE LEAVES OF A PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM WHICH CONTAINED PORTRAITS OF MASTER EDWARD WALLER IN GEOMETRICALLY PROGRESSING DEGREES OF REPULSIVENESS
807-124223-0102 HERE IN FROCKS LOOKING LIKE A GARGOYLE THERE IN SAILOR SUIT LOOKING LIKE NOTHING ON EARTH THE INSPECTION OF THESE WAS OBVIOUSLY DEEPENING MISTER RICHARDS GLOOM BUT HE PROCEEDED DOGGEDLY WITH IT COMRADE PREBBLE BACKED THE RELUCTANT MIKE INTO A CORNER
807-124223-0103 AND LIKE THE ANCIENT MARINER HELD HIM WITH A GLITTERING EYE PSMITH AND MISTER WALLER IN THE OPPOSITE CORNER WERE LOOKING AT SOMETHING WITH THEIR HEADS CLOSE TOGETHER MIKE DEFINITELY ABANDONED ALL HOPE OF A RESCUE FROM PSMITH AND TRIED TO BUOY HIMSELF UP WITH THE REFLECTION
807-124223-0104 THAT THIS COULD NOT LAST FOR EVER HOURS SEEMED TO PASS AND THEN AT LAST HE HEARD PSMITH'S VOICE SAYING GOOD BYE TO HIS HOST HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET COMRADE PREBBLE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE BUT THIS WAS NO TIME FOR POLISHED COURTESY
807-124223-0105 HE FELT THAT HE MUST GET AWAY AND AT ONCE I FEAR PSMITH WAS SAYING THAT WE MUST TEAR OURSELVES AWAY WE HAVE GREATLY ENJOYED OUR EVENING YOU MUST LOOK US UP AT OUR FLAT ONE DAY AND BRING COMRADE PREBBLE IF I AM NOT IN COMRADE JACKSON IS CERTAIN TO BE
807-124223-0106 AND HE WILL BE MORE THAN DELIGHTED TO HEAR COMRADE PREBBLE SPEAK FURTHER ON THE SUBJECT OF WHICH HE IS SUCH A MASTER COMRADE PREBBLE WAS UNDERSTOOD TO SAY THAT HE WOULD CERTAINLY COME MISTER WALLER BEAMED MISTER RICHARDS STILL STEEPED IN GLOOM SHOOK HANDS IN SILENCE
807-124223-0107 OUT IN THE ROAD WITH THE FRONT DOOR SHUT BEHIND THEM MIKE SPOKE HIS MIND LOOK HERE SMITH HE SAID DEFINITELY
807-124223-0108 YOU CAN JOLLY WELL ACCEPT MY RESIGNATION
807-124223-0109 MIKE LAUGHED ONE OF THOSE SHORT HOLLOW BITTER LAUGHS I AM AT A LOSS COMRADE JACKSON SAID PSMITH TO UNDERSTAND YOUR ATTITUDE YOU FED SUMPTUOUSLY YOU HAD FUN WITH THE CROCKERY THAT KNOCKABOUT ACT OF YOURS WITH THE WATER JUG WAS ALONE WORTH THE MONEY
807-124223-0110 AND YOU HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF LISTENING TO THE VIEWS OF A MASTER OF HIS SUBJECT WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT WHAT ON EARTH DID YOU LAND ME WITH THAT MAN PREBBLE FOR LAND YOU WHY YOU COURTED HIS SOCIETY I HAD PRACTICALLY TO DRAG YOU AWAY FROM HIM
807-124223-0111 WHEN I GOT UP TO SAY GOOD BYE YOU WERE LISTENING TO HIM WITH BULGING EYES
807-124223-0112 DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME COMRADE JACKSON THAT YOUR APPEARANCE BELIED YOU THAT YOU WERE NOT INTERESTED WELL WELL HOW WE MISREAD OUR FELLOW CREATURES
807-124223-0113 IT WAS A BIT THICK I WAS TOO ABSORBED WITH COMRADE WALLER WE WERE TALKING OF THINGS OF VITAL MOMENT HOWEVER THE NIGHT IS YET YOUNG WE WILL TAKE THIS CAB WEND OUR WAY TO THE WEST SEEK A CAFE AND CHEER OURSELVES WITH LIGHT REFRESHMENTS
807-124223-0114 ARRIVED AT A CAFE WHOSE WINDOW APPEARED TO BE A SORT OF MUSEUM OF EVERY KIND OF GERMAN SAUSAGE THEY TOOK POSSESSION OF A VACANT TABLE AND ORDERED COFFEE MIKE SOON FOUND HIMSELF SOOTHED BY HIS BRIGHT SURROUNDINGS AND GRADUALLY HIS IMPRESSIONS OF BLANCMANGE
807-124223-0115 EDWARD AND COMRADE PREBBLE FADED FROM HIS MIND PSMITH MEANWHILE WAS PRESERVING AN UNUSUAL SILENCE BEING DEEP IN A LARGE SQUARE BOOK OF THE SORT IN WHICH PRESS CUTTINGS ARE PASTED AS PSMITH SCANNED ITS CONTENTS A CURIOUS SMILE LIT UP HIS FACE
807-124223-0116 HIS REFLECTIONS SEEMED TO BE OF AN AGREEABLE NATURE HULLO SAID MIKE
807-124223-0117 WHERE DID YOU GET THAT COMRADE WALLER VERY KINDLY LENT IT TO ME HE SHOWED IT TO ME AFTER SUPPER KNOWING HOW ENTHUSIASTICALLY I WAS ATTACHED TO THE CAUSE HAD YOU BEEN LESS TENSELY WRAPPED UP IN COMRADE PREBBLE'S CONVERSATION
807-124223-0118 HOWEVER YOU NOW HAVE YOUR OPPORTUNITY
807-124223-0119 IT IS THE RECORD OF THE MEETINGS OF THE TULSE HILL PARLIAMENT SAID PSMITH IMPRESSIVELY A FAITHFUL RECORD OF ALL THEY SAID ALL THE VOTES OF CONFIDENCE THEY PASSED IN THE GOVERNMENT AND ALSO ALL THE NASTY KNOCKS THEY GAVE IT FROM TIME TO TIME WHAT ON EARTH'S THE TULSE HILL PARLIAMENT
