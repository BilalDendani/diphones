4217-9955-0000 A FEW MOMENTS LATER ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK COURFEYRAC CHANCED TO BE PASSING ALONG THE RUE MOUFFETARD IN COMPANY WITH BOSSUET THE SNOW HAD REDOUBLED IN VIOLENCE AND FILLED THE AIR BOSSUET WAS JUST SAYING TO COURFEYRAC
4217-9955-0001 ONE WOULD SAY TO SEE ALL THESE SNOW FLAKES FALL THAT THERE WAS A PLAGUE OF WHITE BUTTERFLIES IN HEAVEN ALL AT ONCE BOSSUET CAUGHT SIGHT OF MARIUS COMING UP THE STREET TOWARDS THE BARRIER WITH A PECULIAR AIR HOLD SAID BOSSUET THERE'S MARIUS
4217-9955-0002 I SAW HIM SAID COURFEYRAC DON'T LET'S SPEAK TO HIM WHY HE IS BUSY WITH WHAT DON'T YOU SEE HIS AIR WHAT AIR HE HAS THE AIR OF A MAN WHO IS FOLLOWING SOME ONE
4217-9955-0003 JUST SEE THE EYES HE IS MAKING SAID COURFEYRAC BUT WHO THE DEUCE IS HE FOLLOWING SOME FINE FLOWERY BONNETED WENCH HE'S IN LOVE BUT OBSERVED BOSSUET I DON'T SEE ANY WENCH NOR ANY FLOWERY BONNET IN THE STREET
4217-9955-0004 THERE'S NOT A WOMAN ROUND COURFEYRAC TOOK A SURVEY AND EXCLAIMED HE'S FOLLOWING A MAN A MAN IN FACT WEARING A GRAY CAP AND WHOSE GRAY BEARD COULD BE DISTINGUISHED ALTHOUGH THEY ONLY SAW HIS BACK
4217-9955-0005 WAS WALKING ALONG ABOUT TWENTY PACES IN ADVANCE OF MARIUS THIS MAN WAS DRESSED IN A GREAT COAT WHICH WAS PERFECTLY NEW AND TOO LARGE FOR HIM AND IN A FRIGHTFUL PAIR OF TROUSERS ALL HANGING IN RAGS AND BLACK WITH MUD
4217-9955-0006 WHO IS THAT MAN HE RETORTED COURFEYRAC HE'S A POET POETS ARE VERY FOND OF WEARING THE TROUSERS OF DEALERS IN RABBIT SKINS AND THE OVERCOATS OF PEERS OF FRANCE LET'S SEE WHERE MARIUS WILL GO SAID BOSSUET
4217-9955-0007 LET'S SEE WHERE THE MAN IS GOING LET'S FOLLOW THEM HEY BOSSUET EXCLAIMED COURFEYRAC EAGLE OF MEAUX
4217-9955-0008 WITHOUT A SUSPICION THAT HE WAS ALREADY HELD BY A GLANCE HE QUITTED THE RUE MOUFFETARD AND MARIUS SAW HIM ENTER ONE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE HOVELS IN THE RUE GRACIEUSE HE REMAINED THERE ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
4217-9955-0009 THEN RETURNED TO THE RUE MOUFFETARD HE HALTED AT AN IRONMONGER'S SHOP WHICH THEN STOOD AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE PIERRE LOMBARD AND A FEW MINUTES LATER MARIUS SAW HIM EMERGE FROM THE SHOP HOLDING IN HIS HAND A HUGE COLD CHISEL
4217-9955-0010 WITH A WHITE WOOD HANDLE WHICH HE CONCEALED BENEATH HIS GREAT COAT AT THE TOP OF THE RUE PETIT GENTILLY
4217-9955-0011 THE DAY WAS DECLINING THE SNOW WHICH HAD CEASED FOR A MOMENT HAD JUST BEGUN AGAIN
4217-9955-0012 WHICH WAS DESERTED AS USUAL AND DID NOT FOLLOW JONDRETTE INTO IT IT WAS LUCKY THAT HE DID SO FOR ON ARRIVING IN THE VICINITY OF THE WALL WHERE MARIUS HAD HEARD THE LONG HAIRED MAN AND THE BEARDED MAN CONVERSING
4217-9955-0013 JONDRETTE TURNED ROUND MADE SURE THAT NO ONE WAS FOLLOWING HIM DID NOT SEE HIM THEN SPRANG ACROSS THE WALL AND DISAPPEARED THE WASTE LAND BORDERED BY THIS WALL
4217-9955-0014 COMMUNICATED WITH THE BACK YARD OF AN EX LIVERY STABLE KEEPER OF BAD REPUTE WHO HAD FAILED AND WHO STILL KEPT A FEW OLD SINGLE SEATED BERLINS UNDER HIS SHEDS
4217-9955-0015 MARIUS THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE WISE TO PROFIT BY JONDRETTE'S ABSENCE TO RETURN HOME MOREOVER IT WAS GROWING LATE EVERY EVENING MA'AM BOUGON WHEN SHE SET OUT FOR HER DISH WASHING IN TOWN HAD A HABIT OF LOCKING THE DOOR
4217-9955-0016 WHICH WAS ALWAYS CLOSED AT DUSK MARIUS HAD GIVEN HIS KEY TO THE INSPECTOR OF POLICE IT WAS IMPORTANT THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD MAKE HASTE EVENING HAD ARRIVED NIGHT HAD ALMOST CLOSED IN
4217-9955-0017 ON THE HORIZON AND IN THE IMMENSITY OF SPACE THERE REMAINED BUT ONE SPOT ILLUMINATED BY THE SUN AND THAT WAS THE MOON IT WAS RISING IN A RUDDY GLOW BEHIND THE LOW DOME OF SALPETRIERE
4217-9955-0018 THE DOOR WAS STILL OPEN WHEN HE ARRIVED HE MOUNTED THE STAIRS ON TIP TOE AND GLIDED ALONG THE WALL OF THE CORRIDOR TO HIS CHAMBER THIS CORRIDOR AS THE READER WILL REMEMBER WAS BORDERED ON BOTH SIDES BY ATTICS ALL OF WHICH WERE FOR THE MOMENT
4217-9955-0019 EMPTY AND TO LET MA'AM BOUGON WAS IN THE HABIT OF LEAVING ALL THE DOORS OPEN AS HE PASSED ONE OF THESE ATTICS MARIUS THOUGHT HE PERCEIVED IN THE UNINHABITED CELL THE MOTIONLESS HEADS OF FOUR MEN
4217-9955-0020 VAGUELY LIGHTED UP BY A REMNANT OF DAYLIGHT FALLING THROUGH A DORMER WINDOW MARIUS MADE NO ATTEMPT TO SEE NOT WISHING TO BE SEEN HIMSELF
4217-9955-0021 HE SUCCEEDED IN REACHING HIS CHAMBER WITHOUT BEING SEEN AND WITHOUT MAKING ANY NOISE IT WAS HIGH TIME A MOMENT LATER HE HEARD MA'AM BOUGON TAKE HER DEPARTURE LOCKING THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE BEHIND HER
4217-9955-0022 IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE WORDS TO AN ENGLISH AIR WHICH WAS IN FASHION IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO MARIUS SEATED HIMSELF ON HIS BED IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HALF PAST FIVE O'CLOCK ONLY HALF AN HOUR SEPARATED HIM FROM WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN
4217-9955-0023 HE HEARD THE BEATING OF HIS ARTERIES AS ONE HEARS THE TICKING OF A WATCH IN THE DARK HE THOUGHT OF THE DOUBLE MARCH WHICH WAS GOING ON AT THAT MOMENT IN THE DARK CRIME ADVANCING ON ONE SIDE JUSTICE COMING UP ON THE OTHER HE WAS NOT AFRAID
4217-9955-0024 BUT HE COULD NOT THINK WITHOUT A SHUDDER OF WHAT WAS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE AS IS THE CASE WITH ALL THOSE WHO ARE SUDDENLY ASSAILED BY AN UNFORESEEN ADVENTURE THE ENTIRE DAY PRODUCED UPON HIM THE EFFECT OF A DREAM
4217-9955-0025 AND IN ORDER TO PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT THE PREY OF A NIGHTMARE HE HAD TO FEEL THE COLD BARRELS OF THE STEEL PISTOLS IN HIS TROUSERS POCKETS IT WAS NO LONGER SNOWING THE MOON DISENGAGED ITSELF MORE AND MORE CLEARLY FROM THE MIST
4217-9955-0026 AND ITS LIGHT MINGLED WITH THE WHITE REFLECTION OF THE SNOW WHICH HAD FALLEN COMMUNICATED TO THE CHAMBER A SORT OF TWILIGHT ASPECT THERE WAS A LIGHT IN THE JONDRETTE DEN
4217-9955-0027 MARIUS SAW THE HOLE IN THE WALL SHINING WITH A REDDISH GLOW WHICH SEEMED BLOODY TO HIM IT WAS TRUE THAT THE LIGHT COULD NOT BE PRODUCED BY A CANDLE HOWEVER THERE WAS NOT A SOUND IN THE JONDRETTE QUARTERS NOT A SOUL WAS MOVING THERE
4217-9955-0028 NOT A SOUL SPEAKING NOT A BREATH THE SILENCE WAS GLACIAL AND PROFOUND AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT LIGHT HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT HIMSELF NEXT DOOR TO A SEPULCHRE MARIUS SOFTLY REMOVED HIS BOOTS AND PUSHED THEM UNDER HIS BED
4217-9955-0029 SEVERAL MINUTES ELAPSED MARIUS HEARD THE LOWER DOOR TURN ON ITS HINGES A HEAVY STEP MOUNTED THE STAIRCASE
4217-9955-0030 THE LATCH OF THE HOVEL WAS NOISILY LIFTED IT WAS JONDRETTE RETURNING INSTANTLY SEVERAL VOICES AROSE THE WHOLE FAMILY WAS IN THE GARRET ONLY IT HAD BEEN SILENT IN THE MASTER'S ABSENCE
