318-124224-0000 IT IS WHEN THE DAYS ARE LONG AND THE SUN BEATS HOT ON THE PAVEMENT AND EVERYTHING SHOUTS TO HIM HOW SPLENDID IT IS OUT IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE BEGINS TO GROW RESTLESS
318-124224-0001 HAD NOT HAD TO STAND THE TEST OF SUNSHINE AT PRESENT THE WEATHER BEING COLD AND DISMAL HE WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY CONTENTED NOW THAT HE HAD GOT INTO THE SWING OF HIS WORK THE DAYS PASSED VERY QUICKLY AND WITH HIS LIFE AFTER OFFICE HOURS HE HAD NO FAULT TO FIND AT ALL
318-124224-0002 HIS LIFE WAS VERY REGULAR
318-124224-0003 THAT WAS AT TEN O'CLOCK FROM TEN TO ELEVEN HE WOULD POTTER THERE WAS NOTHING GOING ON AT THAT TIME IN HIS DEPARTMENT
318-124224-0004 WHO HAD GENERALLY SOME FRESH GRIEVANCE AGAINST THE RING WEARING BRISTOW TO AIR FROM ELEVEN TO HALF PAST TWELVE HE WOULD PUT IN A LITTLE GENTLE WORK LUNCH
318-124224-0005 COULD BE SPUN OUT FROM HALF PAST TWELVE TO TWO MORE WORK FROM TWO TILL HALF PAST THREE FROM HALF PAST THREE TILL HALF PAST FOUR TEA IN THE TEAROOM WITH A NOVEL
318-124224-0006 EITHER A LITTLE MORE WORK OR MORE POTTERING ACCORDING TO WHETHER THERE WAS ANY WORK TO DO OR NOT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN UNPLEASANT MODE OF SPENDING A LATE JANUARY DAY THEN THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT IT WAS AN INTERESTING LITTLE COMMUNITY THAT OF THE NEW ASIATIC BANK
318-124224-0007 THE PLACE WAS FULL OF QUAINT CHARACTERS THERE WAS WEST WHO HAD BEEN REQUESTED TO LEAVE HAILEYBURY OWING TO HIS HABIT OF BORROWING HORSES AND ATTENDING MEETS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
318-124224-0008 HE WENT ABOUT HIS DUTIES IN A COSTUME WHICH SUGGESTED THE SPORTSMAN OF THE COMIC PAPERS THERE WAS ALSO HIGNETT WHO ADDED TO THE MEAGRE SALARY ALLOWED HIM BY THE BANK BY SINGING COMIC SONGS AT THE MINOR MUSIC HALLS
318-124224-0009 HE CONFIDED TO MIKE HIS INTENTION OF LEAVING THE BANK AS SOON AS HE HAD MADE A NAME AND TAKING SERIOUSLY TO THE BUSINESS HE TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD KNOCKED THEM AT THE BEDFORD THE WEEK BEFORE AND IN SUPPORT OF THE STATEMENT SHOWED HIM A CUTTING FROM THE ERA IN WHICH THE WRITER SAID THAT
318-124224-0010 MIKE WISHED HIM LUCK AND THERE WAS RAYMOND WHO DABBLED IN JOURNALISM AND WAS THE AUTHOR OF STRAIGHT TALKS TO HOUSEWIVES IN TRIFLES UNDER THE PSEUDONYM OF LADY GUSSIE WRAGGE
318-124224-0011 WHO BELIEVED THAT THE EARTH WAS FLAT AND ADDRESSED MEETINGS ON THE SUBJECT IN HYDE PARK ON SUNDAYS AND MANY OTHERS
318-124224-0012 MIKE FOUND HIMSELF BY DEGREES GROWING QUITE ATTACHED TO THE NEW ASIATIC BANK ONE MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY
318-124224-0013 THE HEAD OF THE CASH DEPARTMENT WAS AS A RULE MILDLY CHEERFUL ON ARRIVAL AND APT EXCESSIVELY MIKE THOUGHT THOUGH HE ALWAYS LISTENED WITH POLITE INTEREST TO RELATE THE MOST RECENT SAYINGS AND DOINGS OF HIS SNUB NOSED SON EDWARD
318-124224-0014 NO ACTION OF THIS YOUNG PRODIGY WAS WITHHELD FROM MIKE HE HAD HEARD ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS
318-124224-0015 NOW HAPPILY RECONCILED TO ADA WITH AN INGENIOUS VERBAL CATCH
318-124224-0016 THERE WAS A CURIOUSLY GREY TIRED LOOK ON HIS FACE MIKE COULD NOT MAKE IT OUT
318-124224-0017 MISTER WALLER'S FACE HAD THE UNREASONABLE EFFECT ON HIM OF MAKING HIM FEEL SHY AND AWKWARD
318-124224-0018 THE HAPPY THOUGHT STRUCK HIM OF CONSULTING PSMITH IT WAS HIS HOUR FOR POTTERING
318-124224-0019 WHERE HE FOUND THE OLD ETONIAN EYEING WITH DISFAVOUR A NEW SATIN TIE WHICH BRISTOW WAS WEARING THAT MORNING FOR THE FIRST TIME
318-124224-0020 PSMITH ROSE MIKE LED THE WAY TO A QUIET CORNER OF THE TELEGRAMS DEPARTMENT I TELL YOU COMRADE JACKSON SAID PSMITH I AM HARD PRESSED THE FIGHT IS BEGINNING TO BE TOO MUCH FOR ME
318-124224-0021 I SUCCEEDED YESTERDAY IN INDUCING THE MAN BRISTOW TO ABANDON THAT RAINBOW WAISTCOAT OF HIS TODAY I ENTER THE BUILDING BLYTHE AND BUOYANT WORN OF COURSE FROM THE LONG STRUGGLE BUT SEEING WITH ACHING EYES THE DAWN OF ANOTHER BETTER ERA
318-124224-0022 HE'S GOT THE HUMP ABOUT SOMETHING HE'S SITTING THERE LOOKING ABSOLUTELY FED UP WITH THINGS I HOPE THERE'S NOTHING UP HE'S NOT A BAD SORT IT WOULD BE ROT IF ANYTHING ROTTEN'S HAPPENED PSMITH BEGAN TO DISPLAY A GENTLE INTEREST
318-124224-0023 HE MURMURED MUSINGLY I HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT COMRADE WALLER'S MISFORTUNES CANNOT BUT BE TRIVIAL COMPARED WITH MINE BUT POSSIBLY IT WILL BE AS WELL TO ASCERTAIN THEIR NATURE I WILL REEL ROUND AND MAKE INQUIRIES GOOD MAN SAID MIKE
318-124224-0024 WALLER WAS UP ALL NIGHT HE OUGHTN'T TO BE HERE AT ALL TODAY HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING HALF THE TIME HE'S ABSOLUTELY FAGGED OUT LOOK HERE YOU'D BETTER NIP BACK AND DO AS MUCH OF THE WORK AS YOU CAN I SHOULDN'T TALK TO HIM MUCH IF I WERE YOU BUCK ALONG MIKE WENT
318-124224-0025 AND TO REALIZE THAT HIS BLUNT SPEECH WAS LARGELY DUE TO SHYNESS IN SPITE OF HIS PREJUDICE AGAINST EDWARD
318-124224-0026 AND THE CASHIER PUTTING ON HIS COAT AND HAT PASSED SILENTLY OUT THROUGH THE SWING DOORS HE WALKED LISTLESSLY HE WAS EVIDENTLY TIRED OUT MIKE SHUT HIS LEDGER WITH A VICIOUS BANG AND WENT ACROSS TO FIND PSMITH HE WAS GLAD THE DAY WAS OVER
318-124224-0027 CONCERNING A CHEQUE THINGS NEVER HAPPEN QUITE AS ONE EXPECTS THEM TO MIKE CAME TO THE OFFICE NEXT MORNING PREPARED FOR A REPETITION OF THE PREVIOUS DAY HE WAS AMAZED TO FIND THE CASHIER NOT MERELY CHEERFUL BUT EVEN EXUBERANTLY CHEERFUL
318-124224-0028 EDWARD IT APPEARED HAD RALLIED IN THE AFTERNOON
318-124224-0029 HE GREETED CUSTOMERS WITH BRIGHT REMARKS ON THE WEATHER AND SNAPPY VIEWS ON THE LEADING EVENTS OF THE DAY THE FORMER TINGED WITH OPTIMISM THE LATTER FULL OF A GENTLE SPIRIT OF TOLERATION
318-124224-0030 IF ONE COULD ONLY FIND IT ALTOGETHER THE CLOUD HAD LIFTED FROM THE CASH DEPARTMENT ALL WAS JOY JOLLITY AND SONG THE ATTITUDE OF COMRADE WALLER SAID PSMITH
318-124224-0031 IS REASSURING I MAY NOW THINK OF MY OWN TROUBLES COMRADE BRISTOW HAS BLOWN INTO THE OFFICE TODAY IN PATENT LEATHER BOOTS WITH WHITE KID UPPERS AS I BELIEVE THE TECHNICAL TERM IS ADD TO THAT THE FACT THAT HE IS STILL WEARING THE SATIN TIE THE WAISTCOAT AND THE RING
318-124224-0032 AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY I HAVE DEFINITELY DECIDED THIS MORNING TO ABANDON ALL HOPE OF HIS REFORM
318-124224-0033 MY TIME FROM NOW ONWARD IS HIS HE SHALL HAVE THE FULL EDUCATIVE VALUE OF MY EXCLUSIVE ATTENTION I GIVE COMRADE BRISTOW UP MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE CORNER FLAG YOU UNDERSTAND HE ADDED AS MISTER ROSSITER EMERGED FROM HIS LAIR
318-124224-0034 AND CENTRED AND SANDY TURNBULL HEADED A BEAUTIFUL GOAL
318-124224-0035 MOST OF THE GOALS TOWARDS WHICH THE AVERAGE MAN STRIVES STRUCK HIM AS TOO UNAMBITIOUS FOR THE PRODIGY
318-124224-0036 HE NEVER WISHED TO HEAR THE NAME AGAIN WE DO NOT CLAIM ORIGINALITY FOR THE STATEMENT THAT THINGS NEVER HAPPEN QUITE AS ONE EXPECTS THEM TO WE REPEAT IT NOW BECAUSE OF ITS PROFOUND TRUTH THE EDWARD'S PNEUMONIA EPISODE HAVING ENDED SATISFACTORILY
318-124224-0037 OR RATHER BEING APPARENTLY CERTAIN TO END SATISFACTORILY FOR THE INVALID THOUGH OUT OF DANGER WAS STILL IN BED
318-124224-0038 FOR THESE HE WAS PREPARED WHAT HE DID NOT EXPECT WAS ANY BIG CALAMITY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF IT THE SKY WAS BLUE AND FREE FROM ALL SUGGESTIONS OF APPROACHING THUNDERBOLTS
318-124224-0039 MISTER WALLER STILL CHIRPY HAD NOTHING BUT GOOD NEWS OF EDWARD MIKE WENT FOR HIS MORNING STROLL ROUND THE OFFICE FEELING THAT THINGS HAD SETTLED DOWN AND HAD MADE UP THEIR MIND TO RUN SMOOTHLY WHEN HE GOT BACK BARELY HALF AN HOUR LATER THE STORM HAD BURST
318-124224-0040 JACKSON HE SAID MIKE CAME FORWARD DO YOU REMEMBER HE SPOKE SLOWLY AND WITH AN EFFORT
318-124224-0041 SIR JOHN MORRISON'S SIGNATURE YES IT CAME IN THE MORNING RATHER LATE MIKE REMEMBERED THE CHEQUE PERFECTLY WELL OWING TO THE AMOUNT IT WAS THE ONLY THREE FIGURE CHEQUE WHICH HAD COME ACROSS THE COUNTER DURING THE DAY
318-124224-0042 HE RECOLLECTED THE MAN WHO HAD PRESENTED IT A TALLISH MAN WITH A BEARD
318-124224-0043 WHY HE SAID IT WAS A FORGERY MUTTERED MISTER WALLER SITTING DOWN HEAVILY MIKE COULD NOT TAKE IT IN ALL AT ONCE HE WAS STUNNED
318-124224-0044 ALL HE COULD UNDERSTAND WAS THAT A FAR WORSE THING HAD HAPPENED THAN ANYTHING HE COULD HAVE IMAGINED A FORGERY HE SAID A FORGERY AND A CLUMSY ONE
318-124224-0045 OH IT'S HARD I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT ON ANY OTHER DAY BUT THAT I COULD NOT HAVE MISSED IT THEY SHOWED ME THE CHEQUE IN THERE JUST NOW I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I HAD PASSED IT I DON'T REMEMBER DOING IT MY MIND WAS FAR AWAY I DON'T REMEMBER THE CHEQUE OR ANYTHING ABOUT IT
318-124224-0046 YET THERE IT IS ONCE MORE MIKE WAS TONGUE TIED FOR THE LIFE OF HIM HE COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY
318-124224-0047 BUT HE COULD FIND NOTHING THAT WOULD NOT SOUND HORRIBLY STILTED AND COLD HE SAT SILENT SIR JOHN IS IN THERE
318-124224-0048 HE IS FURIOUS MISTER BICKERSDYKE TOO THEY ARE BOTH FURIOUS I SHALL BE DISMISSED I SHALL LOSE MY PLACE I SHALL BE DISMISSED HE WAS TALKING MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO MIKE IT WAS DREADFUL TO SEE HIM SITTING THERE ALL LIMP AND BROKEN
318-124224-0049 I SHALL LOSE MY PLACE MISTER BICKERSDYKE HAS WANTED TO GET RID OF ME FOR A LONG TIME HE NEVER LIKED ME I SHALL BE DISMISSED WHAT CAN I DO I'M AN OLD MAN
318-124224-0050 NOBODY WILL TAKE AN OLD MAN LIKE ME HIS VOICE DIED AWAY THERE WAS A SILENCE MIKE SAT STARING MISERABLY IN FRONT OF HIM THEN QUITE SUDDENLY AN IDEA CAME TO HIM
318-124224-0051 THE WHOLE PRESSURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE SEEMED TO LIFT HE SAW A WAY OUT IT WAS A CURIOUS CROOKED WAY BUT AT THAT MOMENT IT STRETCHED CLEAR AND BROAD BEFORE HIM HE FELT LIGHTHEARTED AND EXCITED AS IF HE WERE WATCHING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME INTERESTING PLAY AT THE THEATRE HE GOT UP
318-124224-0052 SMILING THE CASHIER DID NOT NOTICE THE MOVEMENT SOMEBODY HAD COME IN TO CASH A CHEQUE AND HE WAS WORKING MECHANICALLY
318-124224-0053 AND WENT IN THE MANAGER WAS IN HIS CHAIR AT THE BIG TABLE OPPOSITE HIM
318-124224-0054 THE SITUATION WAS TICKLING HIM MISTER WALLER HAS TOLD ME HE BEGAN I HAVE ALREADY SEEN MISTER WALLER I KNOW HE TOLD ME ABOUT THE CHEQUE I CAME TO EXPLAIN EXPLAIN YES
318-124224-0055 HE DIDN'T CASH IT AT ALL I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU MISTER JACKSON I WAS AT THE COUNTER WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT IN SAID MIKE I CASHED IT
318-124224-0056 PSMITH MAKES INQUIRIES PSMITH AS WAS HIS HABIT OF A MORNING WHEN THE FIERCE RUSH OF HIS COMMERCIAL DUTIES HAD ABATED SOMEWHAT WAS LEANING GRACEFULLY AGAINST HIS DESK
318-124224-0057 FOCUSING HIS ATTENTION WITH SOME RELUCTANCE UPON THIS BLOT ON THE HORIZON HE DISCOVERED THAT THE EXPLOITER OF RAINBOW WAISTCOATS AND SATIN TIES WAS ADDRESSING HIM I SAY SMITHY SAID BRISTOW HE SPOKE IN RATHER AN AWED VOICE
318-124224-0058 I REGRET TO SEE YOU STILL FLAUNT IF IT IS ONE TITHE AS PAINFUL AS THAT YOU HAVE MY SYMPATHY JERK IT OUT COMRADE BRISTOW
318-124224-0059 HE'S GETTING IT HOT ON THE CARPET YOU WISH TO INDICATE SAID PSMITH THAT THERE IS SOME SLIGHT DISTURBANCE SOME PASSING BREEZE BETWEEN COMRADES JACKSON AND BICKERSDYKE BRISTOW CHUCKLED BREEZE
318-124224-0060 BLOOMING HURRICANE MORE LIKE IT I WAS IN BICK'S ROOM JUST NOW WITH A LETTER TO SIGN AND I TELL YOU THE FUR WAS FLYING ALL OVER THE BALLY SHOP
318-124224-0061 WE ALL HAVE OUR HOBBIES SAID PSMITH JACKSON WASN'T SAYING MUCH HE JOLLY WELL HADN'T A CHANCE OLD BICK WAS SHOOTING IT OUT FOURTEEN TO THE DOZEN I HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED SAID PSMITH TO HEAR COMRADE BICKERSDYKE SPEAK BOTH IN HIS SANCTUM AND IN PUBLIC
318-124224-0062 WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TURMOIL I COULDN'T WAIT TO HEAR I WAS TOO JOLLY GLAD TO GET AWAY OLD BICK LOOKED AT ME AS IF HE COULD EAT ME
318-124224-0063 WHICH I JOLLY WELL DID HE HAD STARTED JAWING JACKSON AGAIN BEFORE I WAS OUT OF THE ROOM WHILE APPLAUDING HIS HUSTLE SAID PSMITH I FEAR THAT I MUST TAKE OFFICIAL NOTICE OF THIS COMRADE JACKSON IS ESSENTIALLY A SENSITIVE PLANT HIGHLY STRUNG
318-124224-0064 NEUROTIC I CANNOT HAVE HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM JOLTED AND DISORGANIZED IN THIS MANNER AND HIS VALUE AS A CONFIDENTIAL SECRETARY AND ADVISER IMPAIRED EVEN THOUGH IT BE ONLY TEMPORARILY I MUST LOOK INTO THIS I WILL GO AND SEE IF THE ORGY IS CONCLUDED
318-124224-0065 BUT IF I FIND AS I SUSPECT THAT HE HAS WRONGED COMRADE JACKSON I SHALL BE FORCED TO SPEAK SHARPLY TO HIM MIKE HAD LEFT THE SCENE OF BATTLE BY THE TIME PSMITH REACHED THE CASH DEPARTMENT
318-124224-0066 IT EMBRACES A HUNDRED DEGREES OF MEANING MIKE HAD EXPECTED SENTENCE OF DISMISSAL AND HE HAD GOT IT SO FAR HE HAD NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF
318-124224-0067 HE HAD THUNDERED AT MIKE AS IF MIKE HAD BEEN HIS MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT OR THE ENCROACHING ALIEN OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT AND THAT KIND OF THING IS A LITTLE OVERWHELMING AT SHORT RANGE MIKE'S HEAD WAS STILL SPINNING IT CONTINUED TO SPIN
318-124224-0068 BUT HE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THE FACT ROUND WHICH IT REVOLVED
318-124224-0069 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT THEY WOULD SAY ABOUT THIS AT HOME UP TILL NOW THE MATTER HAD SEEMED ENTIRELY A PERSONAL ONE
318-124224-0070 AGAIN WHAT COULD HE DO BY WAY OF EARNING A LIVING HE DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE CITY AND ITS WAYS BUT HE KNEW ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT SUMMARY DISMISSAL FROM A BANK IS NOT THE BEST RECOMMENDATION ONE CAN PUT FORWARD IN APPLYING FOR ANOTHER JOB
318-124224-0071 LOOK HERE SMITH HE SAID I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU I'M IN A BIT OF A HOLE
318-124224-0072 BUT MY ABSENCE WILL NOT SPELL IRRETRIEVABLE RUIN AS IT WOULD AT A PERIOD OF GREATER COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY COMRADES ROSSITER AND BRISTOW HAVE STUDIED MY METHODS THEY KNOW HOW I LIKE THINGS TO BE DONE THEY ARE FULLY COMPETENT TO CONDUCT THE BUSINESS OF THE DEPARTMENT IN MY ABSENCE
318-124224-0073 LET US AS YOU SAY SCUD FORTH WE WILL GO TO A MECCA WHY SO CALLED I DO NOT KNOW NOR INDEED DO I EVER HOPE TO KNOW THERE WE MAY OBTAIN AT A PRICE A PASSABLE CUP OF COFFEE AND YOU SHALL TELL ME YOUR PAINFUL STORY
318-124224-0074 TELL ME ALL HE LISTENED GRAVELY WHILE MIKE RELATED THE INCIDENTS WHICH HAD LED UP TO HIS CONFESSION AND THE RESULTS OF THE SAME AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE NARRATIVE HE SIPPED HIS COFFEE IN SILENCE FOR A MOMENT
318-124224-0075 YOU BEGIN IN A SMALL WAY BY BREAKING SCHOOL RULES TO EXTRACT COMRADE JELLICOE PERHAPS THE SUPREMEST OF ALL THE BLITHERERS I HAVE EVER MET FROM A HOLE IF YOU HAD STOPPED THERE ALL MIGHT HAVE BEEN WELL BUT THE THING ONCE STARTED FASCINATED YOU
318-124224-0076 YOU MUST DROP IT COMRADE JACKSON WHEN YOU WERE FREE AND WITHOUT TIES IT DID NOT SO MUCH MATTER
318-124224-0077 THE THING MUST STOP YOUR SECRETARIAL DUTIES MUST BE PARAMOUNT NOTHING MUST BE ALLOWED TO INTERFERE WITH THEM YES THE THING MUST STOP BEFORE IT GOES TOO FAR IT SEEMS TO ME SAID MIKE THAT IT HAS GONE TOO FAR I'VE GOT THE SACK
318-124224-0078 PSMITH STIRRED HIS COFFEE BEFORE REPLYING
318-124224-0079 BUT ALL IS NOT YET LOST YOU MUST RECOLLECT THAT COMRADE BICKERSDYKE SPOKE IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT THAT GENEROUS TEMPERAMENT WAS STIRRED TO ITS DEPTHS HE DID NOT PICK HIS WORDS BUT CALM WILL SUCCEED STORM AND WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING YET
318-124224-0080 COMRADE B HAD TO LAY IT ON REGARDLESS OF EXPENSE IN AMERICA AS POSSIBLY YOU ARE AWARE THERE IS A REGULAR POST OF MISTAKE CLERK WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO RECEIVE IN THE NECK ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO BE COMING ALONG WHEN CUSTOMERS MAKE COMPLAINTS HE IS HAULED INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE FOAMING CUSTOMER
318-124224-0081 APPLIES FOR A RISE OF SALARY NOW POSSIBLY IN YOUR CASE IN MY CASE INTERRUPTED MIKE THERE WAS NONE OF THAT ROT BICKERSDYKE WASN'T PUTTING IT ON HE MEANT EVERY WORD
318-124224-0082 HOW DO THESE IDEAS GET ABOUT I YIELD TO NOBODY IN MY RESPECT FOR OUR MANAGER I MAY HAVE HAD OCCASION FROM TIME TO TIME TO CORRECT HIM IN SOME TRIFLING MATTER
318-124224-0083 NO I PREFER TO THINK THAT COMRADE BICKERSDYKE REGARDS ME AS HIS FRIEND AND WELL WISHER AND WILL LEND A COURTEOUS EAR TO ANY PROPOSAL I SEE FIT TO MAKE I HOPE SHORTLY TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THIS TO YOU
318-124224-0084 LOOK HERE SMITH SAID MIKE EARNESTLY FOR GOODNESS SAKE DON'T GO PLAYING THE GOAT THERE'S NO EARTHLY NEED FOR YOU TO GET LUGGED INTO THIS BUSINESS DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT ME I SHALL BE ALL RIGHT I THINK SAID PSMITH THAT YOU WILL
