4779-54868-0000 MISS MARRABLE HEARD THE STORY OF THE CAPTAIN'S LOSS IN PERFECT SILENCE MARY TOLD IT CRAFTILY WITH A SMILE ON HER FACE AS THOUGH SHE WERE BUT SLIGHTLY AFFECTED BY IT AND DID NOT THINK VERY MUCH ON THE CHANGE IT MIGHT EFFECT IN HER PLANS AND THOSE OF HER LOVER
4779-54868-0001 HE HAS BEEN ILL TREATED HAS HE NOT SHE SAID VERY BADLY TREATED I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE HAS BEEN MOST SHAMEFULLY TREATED HE TRIED TO EXPLAIN IT ALL TO ME BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT HE SUCCEEDED
4779-54868-0002 AND THE MONEY WAS ALL GONE HE COULD RECOVER IT FROM HIS FATHER BY LAW ONLY THAT HIS FATHER HAS GOT NOTHING AND THAT IS TO BE THE END OF IT THAT IS THE END OF OUR FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS SAID MARY FORCING A LITTLE LAUGH
4779-54868-0003 MISS MARRABLE FOR A FEW MOMENTS MADE NO REPLY SHE SAT FIDGETY IN HER SEAT FEELING THAT IT WAS HER DUTY TO EXPLAIN TO MARY WHAT MUST IN HER OPINION BE THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF THIS MISFORTUNE AND YET NOT KNOWING HOW TO BEGIN HER TASK
4779-54868-0004 MARY WAS PARTLY AWARE OF WHAT WAS COMING AND HAD FORTIFIED HERSELF TO REJECT ALL ADVICE TO ASSERT HER RIGHT TO DO AS SHE PLEASED WITH HERSELF AND TO PROTEST THAT SHE CARED NOTHING FOR THE PRUDENT VIEWS OF WORLDLY MINDED PEOPLE BUT SHE WAS AFRAID OF WHAT WAS COMING
4779-54868-0005 SHE KNEW THAT ARGUMENTS WOULD BE USED WHICH SHE WOULD FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO ANSWER AND ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SETTLED UPON CERTAIN STRONG WORDS WHICH SHE WOULD SPEAK SHE FELT THAT SHE WOULD BE DRIVEN AT LAST TO QUARREL WITH HER AUNT ON ONE THING SHE WAS QUITE RESOLVED
4779-54868-0006 NOTHING SHOULD INDUCE HER TO GIVE UP HER ENGAGEMENT SHORT OF THE EXPRESSION OF A WISH TO THAT EFFECT FROM WALTER MARRABLE HIMSELF HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YOU DEAR SAID MISS MARRABLE AT LAST I SHOULD HAVE BEEN A POOR MAN'S WIFE ANY HOW
4779-54868-0007 NOW I SHALL BE THE WIFE OF A VERY POOR MAN I SUPPOSE THAT WILL BE THE EFFECT WHAT WILL HE DO HE HAS AUNT MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO TO INDIA HAS HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO ANYTHING ELSE OF COURSE I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN AUNT
4779-54868-0008 WHY SHOULD YOU NOT KNOW I MEAN THAT A MAN GOING OUT TO INDIA AND INTENDING TO LIVE THERE AS AN OFFICER ON HIS PAY CANNOT BE IN WANT OF A WIFE YOU SPEAK OF A WIFE AS IF SHE WERE THE SAME AS A COACH AND FOUR OR A BOX AT THE OPERA
4779-54868-0009 A SORT OF LUXURY FOR RICH MEN MARRIAGE AUNT IS LIKE DEATH COMMON TO ALL IN OUR POSITION IN LIFE MARY MARRIAGE CANNOT BE MADE SO COMMON AS TO BE UNDERTAKEN WITHOUT FORESIGHT FOR THE MORROW
4779-54868-0010 A POOR GENTLEMAN IS FURTHER REMOVED FROM MARRIAGE THAN ANY OTHER MAN ONE KNOWS OF COURSE THAT THERE WILL BE DIFFICULTIES WHAT I MEAN MARY IS THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO GIVE IT UP NEVER AUNT SARAH I SHALL NEVER GIVE IT UP
4779-54868-0011 DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU WILL MARRY HIM NOW AT ONCE AND GO OUT TO INDIA WITH HIM AS A DEAD WEIGHT ROUND HIS NECK I MEAN THAT HE SHALL CHOOSE ABOUT THAT IT IS FOR YOU TO CHOOSE MARY DON'T BE ANGRY I AM BOUND TO TELL YOU WHAT I THINK
4779-54868-0012 YOU CAN OF COURSE ACT AS YOU PLEASE BUT I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO LISTEN TO ME HE CANNOT GO BACK FROM HIS ENGAGEMENT WITHOUT LAYING HIMSELF OPEN TO IMPUTATION OF BAD CONDUCT NOR CAN I PARDON ME DEAR THAT DEPENDS I THINK UPON WHAT PASSES BETWEEN YOU
4779-54868-0013 IT IS AT ANY RATE FOR YOU TO PROPOSE THE RELEASE TO HIM NOT TO FIX HIM WITH THE BURTHEN OF PROPOSING IT MARY'S HEART QUAILED AS SHE HEARD THIS BUT SHE DID NOT SHOW HER FEELING BY ANY EXPRESSION ON HER FACE FOR A MAN PLACED AS HE IS
4779-54868-0014 ABOUT TO RETURN TO SUCH A CLIMATE AS THAT OF INDIA WITH SUCH WORK BEFORE HIM AS I SUPPOSE MEN HAVE THERE THE BURDEN OF A WIFE WITHOUT THE MEANS OF MAINTAINING HER ACCORDING TO HIS VIEWS OF LIFE AND HERS
4779-54868-0015 IT IS THE OLD STORY OF LOVE AND A COTTAGE ONLY UNDER THE MOST UNFAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES A WOMAN'S VIEW OF IT IS OF COURSE DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF A MAN HE HAS SEEN MORE OF THE WORLD AND KNOWS BETTER THAN SHE DOES WHAT POVERTY AND A WIFE AND FAMILY MEAN
4779-54868-0016 THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD BE MARRIED AT ONCE A LONG ENGAGEMENT FOR YOU WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY DISASTROUS
4779-54868-0017 THE LOSS OF WALTER'S MONEY IS DISASTROUS ONE HAS TO PUT UP WITH DISASTER BUT THE WORST OF ALL DISASTERS WOULD BE TO BE SEPARATED I CAN STAND ANYTHING BUT THAT IT SEEMS TO ME MARY THAT WITHIN THE LAST FEW WEEKS YOUR CHARACTER HAS BECOME ALTOGETHER ALTERED
4779-54868-0018 OF COURSE IT HAS YOU USED TO THINK SO MUCH MORE OF OTHER PEOPLE THAN YOURSELF DON'T I THINK OF HIM AUNT SARAH AS OF A THING OF YOUR OWN TWO MONTHS AGO YOU DID NOT KNOW HIM AND NOW YOU ARE A MILLSTONE ROUND HIS NECK
4779-54868-0019 HAD ATTACKED HER IN HER MISERY WITHOUT MERCY AND YET SHE KNEW THAT EVERY WORD THAT HAD BEEN UTTERED HAD BEEN SPOKEN IN PURE AFFECTION SHE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HER AUNT'S CHIEF PURPOSE HAD BEEN TO SAVE WALTER FROM THE FRUITS OF AN IMPRUDENT MARRIAGE
4779-54868-0020 HAD SHE SO BELIEVED THE WORDS WOULD HAVE HAD MORE EFFECT ON HER SHE SAW OR THOUGHT THAT SHE SAW THAT HER AUNT WAS TRYING TO SAVE HERSELF AGAINST HER OWN WILL AND AT THIS SHE WAS INDIGNANT
4779-54868-0021 SHE WAS DETERMINED TO PERSEVERE AND THIS ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE HER FEEL THAT HER PERSEVERANCE WOULD BE DISASTROUS TO THE MAN SHE LOVED WAS SHE THOUGHT VERY CRUEL SHE STALKED UPSTAIRS WITH UNRUFFLED DEMEANOUR BUT WHEN THERE SHE THREW HERSELF ON HER BED AND SOBBED BITTERLY
4779-54868-0022 COULD IT BE THAT IT WAS HER DUTY FOR HIS SAKE TO TELL HIM THAT THE WHOLE THING SHOULD BE AT AN END IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO DO SO NOW BECAUSE SHE HAD SWORN TO HIM THAT SHE WOULD BE GUIDED ALTOGETHER BY HIM IN HIS PRESENT TROUBLES SHE MUST KEEP HER WORD TO HIM WHATEVER HAPPENED
4779-54868-0023 BUT OF THIS SHE WAS QUITE SURE THAT IF HE SHOULD SHOW THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF A WISH TO BE FREE FROM HIS ENGAGEMENT SHE WOULD MAKE HIM FREE AT ONCE SHE WOULD MAKE HIM FREE AND WOULD NEVER ALLOW HERSELF TO THINK FOR A MOMENT THAT HE HAD BEEN WRONG SHE HAD TOLD HIM WHAT HER OWN FEELINGS WERE VERY PLAINLY
4779-54868-0024 PERHAPS IN HER ENTHUSIASM TOO PLAINLY AND NOW HE MUST JUDGE FOR HIMSELF AND FOR HER IN RESPECT TO HER AUNT SHE WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO AVOID ANY FURTHER CONVERSATION ON THE SUBJECT TILL HER LOVER SHOULD HAVE DECIDED FINALLY WHAT WOULD BE BEST FOR BOTH OF THEM
4779-54868-0025 IF HE SHOULD CHOOSE TO SAY THAT EVERYTHING BETWEEN THEM SHOULD BE OVER SHE WOULD ACQUIESCE AND ALL THE WORLD SHOULD BE OVER FOR HER AT THE SAME TIME WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON IN UPHILL LANE SOMETHING OF THE SAME KIND WAS TAKING PLACE AT THE LOWTOWN PARSONAGE
4779-54868-0026 PARSON JOHN BECAME AWARE THAT HIS NEPHEW HAD BEEN WITH THE LADIES AT UPHILL AND WHEN THE YOUNG MAN CAME IN FOR LUNCH HE ASKED SOME QUESTION WHICH INTRODUCED THE SUBJECT YOU'VE TOLD THEM OF THIS FRESH TROUBLE NO DOUBT I DIDN'T SEE MISS MARRABLE SAID THE CAPTAIN
4779-54868-0027 I DON'T KNOW THAT MISS MARRABLE MUCH SIGNIFIES YOU HAVEN'T ASKED MISS MARRABLE TO BE YOUR WIFE I SAW MARY AND I TOLD HER I HOPE YOU MADE NO BONES ABOUT IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN SIR I HOPE YOU TOLD HER
4779-54868-0028 THAT YOU TWO HAD HAD YOUR LITTLE GAME OF PLAY LIKE TWO CHILDREN AND THAT THERE MUST BE AN END OF IT NO I DIDN'T TELL HER THAT
4779-54868-0029 I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT FOR A STRONG FELLOW LIKE YOU WHEN HE'S USED TO IT INDIA MAY BE A JOLLY PLACE ENOUGH IT'S A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND BUT FOR A POOR MAN WITH A WIFE AND FAMILY OH DEAR IT MUST BE VERY BAD INDEED
4779-54868-0030 AND NEITHER OF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN USED TO THAT KIND OF THING I HAVE NOT SAID THE CAPTAIN NOR HAS SHE THAT OLD LADY UP THERE IS NOT RICH BUT SHE IS AS PROUD AS LUCIFER AND ALWAYS LIVES AS THOUGH THE WHOLE PLACE BELONGED TO HER
4779-54868-0031 SHE'S A GOOD MANAGER AND SHE DON'T RUN IN DEBT BUT MARY LOWTHER KNOWS NO MORE OF ROUGHING IT THAN A DUCHESS I HOPE I MAY NEVER HAVE TO TEACH HER I TRUST YOU NEVER MAY IT'S A VERY BAD LESSON FOR A YOUNG MAN TO HAVE TO TEACH A YOUNG WOMAN SOME WOMEN DIE IN THE LEARNING
4779-54868-0032 SOME WON'T LEARN IT AT ALL OTHERS DO AND BECOME DIRTY AND ROUGH THEMSELVES NOW YOU ARE VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT WOMEN I LIKE TO SEE THEM WELL TURNED OUT WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF YOUR OWN WIFE NURSING PERHAPS A COUPLE OF BABIES
4779-54868-0033 DRESSED NOHOW WHEN SHE GETS UP IN THE MORNING AND GOING ON IN THE SAME WAY TILL NIGHT THAT'S THE KIND OF LIFE WITH OFFICERS WHO MARRY ON THEIR PAY I DON'T SAY ANYTHING AGAINST IT
4779-54868-0034 THAT YOU'D FEEL HALF LIKE CUTTING HER THROAT OR YOUR OWN IT WOULD BE THE LATTER FOR CHOICE SIR I DARE SAY IT WOULD BUT EVEN THAT ISN'T A PLEASANT THING TO LOOK FORWARD TO I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT IT MY BOY
4779-54868-0035 WHEN YOU FIRST CAME TO ME AND TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE GOING TO MARRY MARY LOWTHER I KNEW IT COULD NOT BE IT WAS NO BUSINESS OF MINE BUT I KNEW IT COULD NOT BE SUCH ENGAGEMENTS ALWAYS GET THEMSELVES BROKEN OFF SOMEHOW NOW AND AGAIN THERE ARE A PAIR OF FOOLS WHO GO THROUGH WITH IT
4779-54868-0036 BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT'S A MATTER OF KISSING AND LOVERS VOWS FOR A WEEK OR TWO YOU SEEM TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT UNCLE JOHN
4779-54868-0037 I DARE SAY IF THE TRUTH WERE KNOWN YOU'VE A FEW DEBTS HERE AND THERE I MAY OWE THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS OR SO AS MUCH AS A YEAR'S INCOME AND YOU TALK OF MARRYING A GIRL WITHOUT A FARTHING SHE HAS TWELVE HUNDRED POUNDS
4779-54868-0038 JUST ENOUGH TO PAY YOUR OWN DEBTS AND TAKE YOU OUT TO INDIA SO THAT YOU MAY START WITHOUT A PENNY
4779-54868-0039 CAN YOU TRUST YOURSELF TO THAT KIND OF THING WITH A WIFE UNDER YOUR ARM IF YOU WERE A MAN OF FORTUNE NO DOUBT MARY WOULD MAKE A VERY NICE WIFE BUT AS IT IS YOU MUST GIVE IT UP
