4846-18524-0076 AND THEN THE ONE PLEASURE HE HAD WAS IN PICKING OUT SOMETHING FOR POLLY OH IF THE LITTLE RED LEATHER CASE HAD GONE BACK TO THE POOR OLD MAN RAN THROUGH MOTHER FISHER'S MIND
4846-18524-0077 I DON'T THINK HIS JUDGMENT WAS GOOD MISSUS FISHER IN THE SELECTION SAID MISSUS SELWYN A SMALL PINK SPOT COMING ON EITHER CHEEK BUT HE LOVES POLLY
