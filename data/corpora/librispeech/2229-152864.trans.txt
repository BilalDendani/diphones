2229-152864-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY ONE THE SEXTON'S OLD HORSE I STOOD AND WATCHED THE LAST GLEAM OF THE WHITE LEOPARDESS MELT AWAY THEN TURNED TO FOLLOW MY GUIDE BUT RELUCTANTLY WHAT HAD I TO DO WITH SLEEP
2229-152864-0001 SURELY REASON WAS THE SAME IN EVERY WORLD AND WHAT REASON COULD THERE BE IN GOING TO SLEEP WITH THE DEAD WHEN THE HOUR WAS CALLING THE LIVE MAN BESIDES NO ONE WOULD WAKE ME AND HOW COULD I BE CERTAIN OF WAKING EARLY OF WAKING AT ALL
2229-152864-0002 THE SLEEPERS IN THAT HOUSE LET MORNING GLIDE INTO NOON AND NOON INTO NIGHT NOR EVER STIRRED I MURMURED BUT FOLLOWED FOR I KNEW NOT WHAT ELSE TO DO
2229-152864-0003 THE LIBRARIAN WALKED ON IN SILENCE AND I WALKED SILENT AS HE TIME AND SPACE GLIDED PAST US THE SUN SET IT BEGAN TO GROW DARK AND I FELT IN THE AIR THE SPREADING COLD OF THE CHAMBER OF DEATH
2229-152864-0004 MY HEART SANK LOWER AND LOWER I BEGAN TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE LEAN LONG COATED FIGURE AND AT LENGTH COULD NO MORE HEAR HIS SWISHING STRIDE THROUGH THE HEATHER BUT THEN I HEARD INSTEAD THE SLOW FLAPPING WINGS OF THE RAVEN
2229-152864-0005 AND AT INTERVALS NOW A FIREFLY NOW A GLEAMING BUTTERFLY ROSE INTO THE RAYLESS AIR BY AND BY THE MOON APPEARED SLOW CROSSING THE FAR HORIZON
2229-152864-0006 YOU ARE TIRED ARE YOU NOT MISTER VANE SAID THE RAVEN ALIGHTING ON A STONE YOU MUST MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE HORSE THAT WILL CARRY YOU IN THE MORNING HE GAVE A STRANGE WHISTLE THROUGH HIS LONG BLACK BEAK
2229-152864-0007 A SPOT APPEARED ON THE FACE OF THE HALF RISEN MOON TO MY EARS CAME PRESENTLY THE DRUMMING OF SWIFT SOFT GALLOPING HOOFS AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO OUT OF THE VERY DISC OF THE MOON LOW THUNDERED THE TERRIBLE HORSE
2229-152864-0008 HIS MANE FLOWED AWAY BEHIND HIM LIKE THE CREST OF A WIND FIGHTING WAVE TORN SEAWARD IN HOARY SPRAY AND THE WHISK OF HIS TAIL KEPT BLINDING THE EYE OF THE MOON NINETEEN HANDS HE SEEMED HUGE OF BONE TIGHT OF SKIN
2229-152864-0009 HARD OF MUSCLE A STEED THE HOLY DEATH HIMSELF MIGHT CHOOSE ON WHICH TO RIDE ABROAD AND SLAY THE MOON SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH AWE IN HER SCARY LIGHT HE LOOKED A VERY SKELETON LOOSELY ROPED TOGETHER
2229-152864-0010 TERRIFICALLY LARGE HE MOVED WITH THE LIGHTNESS OF A WINGED INSECT AS HE DREW NEAR HIS SPEED SLACKENED AND HIS MANE AND TAIL DRIFTED ABOUT HIM SETTLING
2229-152864-0011 NOW I WAS NOT MERELY A LOVER OF HORSES BUT I LOVED EVERY HORSE I SAW I HAD NEVER SPENT MONEY EXCEPT UPON HORSES AND HAD NEVER SOLD A HORSE THE SIGHT OF THIS MIGHTY ONE TERRIBLE TO LOOK AT
2229-152864-0012 WOKE IN ME LONGING TO POSSESS HIM IT WAS PURE GREED NAY RANK COVETOUSNESS AN EVIL THING IN ALL THE WORLDS I DO NOT MEAN THAT I COULD HAVE STOLEN HIM BUT THAT REGARDLESS OF HIS PROPER PLACE I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT HIM IF I COULD
2229-152864-0013 I LAID MY HANDS ON HIM AND STROKED THE PROTUBERANT BONES THAT HUMPED A HIDE SMOOTH AND THIN AND SHINY AS SATIN SO SHINY THAT THE VERY SHAPE OF THE MOON WAS REFLECTED IN IT I FONDLED HIS SHARP POINTED EARS WHISPERED WORDS IN THEM
2229-152864-0014 AND BREATHED INTO HIS RED NOSTRILS THE BREATH OF A MAN'S LIFE HE IN RETURN BREATHED INTO MINE THE BREATH OF A HORSE'S LIFE AND WE LOVED ONE ANOTHER WHAT EYES HE HAD BLUE FILMY LIKE THE EYES OF THE DEAD
2229-152864-0015 BEHIND EACH WAS A GLOWING COAL THE RAVEN WITH WINGS HALF EXTENDED LOOKED ON PLEASED AT MY LOVE MAKING TO HIS MAGNIFICENT HORSE THAT IS WELL BE FRIENDS WITH HIM HE SAID HE WILL CARRY YOU ALL THE BETTER TO MORROW
2229-152864-0016 NOW WE MUST HURRY HOME MY DESIRE TO RIDE THE HORSE HAD GROWN PASSIONATE MAY I NOT MOUNT HIM AT ONCE MISTER RAVEN I CRIED BY ALL MEANS HE ANSWERED MOUNT AND RIDE HIM HOME
2229-152864-0017 THE HORSE BENT HIS HEAD OVER MY SHOULDER LOVINGLY I TWISTED MY HANDS IN HIS MANE AND SCRAMBLED ONTO HIS BACK NOT WITHOUT AID FROM CERTAIN PROTUBERANT BONES HE WOULD OUTSPEED ANY LEOPARD IN CREATION I CRIED
2229-152864-0018 NOT THAT WAY AT NIGHT ANSWERED THE RAVEN THE ROAD IS DIFFICULT BUT COME LOSS NOW WILL BE GAIN THEN TO WAIT IS HARDER THAN TO RUN AND ITS MEED IS THE FULLER
2229-152864-0019 GO ON MY SON STRAIGHT TO THE COTTAGE I SHALL BE THERE AS SOON AS YOU IT WILL REJOICE MY WIFE'S HEART TO SEE SON OF HERS ON THAT HORSE I SAT SILENT THE HORSE STOOD LIKE A BLOCK OF MARBLE
2229-152864-0020 WHY DO YOU LINGER ASKED THE RAVEN I LONG SO MUCH TO RIDE AFTER THE LEOPARDESS I ANSWERED THAT I CAN SCARCE RESTRAIN MYSELF YOU HAVE PROMISED
2229-152864-0021 MY DEBT TO THE LITTLE ONES APPEARS I CONFESS A GREATER THING THAN MY BOND TO YOU YIELD TO THE TEMPTATION AND YOU WILL BRING MISCHIEF UPON THEM AND ON YOURSELF ALSO WHAT MATTERS IT FOR ME I
2229-152864-0022 I WILL GO BUT THE TRUTH WAS I FORGOT THE CHILDREN INFATUATE WITH THE HORSE EYES FLASHED THROUGH THE DARKNESS AND I KNEW THAT ADAM STOOD IN HIS OWN SHAPE BESIDE ME
2229-152864-0023 I KNEW ALSO BY HIS VOICE THAT HE REPRESSED AN INDIGNATION ALMOST TOO STRONG FOR HIM MISTER VANE HE SAID DO YOU NOT KNOW WHY YOU HAVE NOT YET DONE ANYTHING WORTH DOING BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN A FOOL I ANSWERED
2229-152864-0024 WHEREIN IN EVERYTHING WHICH DO YOU COUNT YOUR MOST INDISCREET ACTION BRINGING THE PRINCESS TO LIFE I OUGHT TO HAVE LEFT HER TO HER JUST FATE
2229-152864-0025 NAY NOW YOU TALK FOOLISHLY YOU COULD NOT HAVE DONE OTHERWISE THAN YOU DID NOT KNOWING SHE WAS EVIL BUT YOU NEVER BROUGHT ANY ONE TO LIFE HOW COULD YOU YOURSELF DEAD I DEAD I CRIED
2229-152864-0026 YES HE ANSWERED AND YOU WILL BE DEAD SO LONG AS YOU REFUSE TO DIE BACK TO THE OLD RIDDLING I RETURNED SCORNFULLY BE PERSUADED AND GO HOME WITH ME HE CONTINUED GENTLY THE MOST
2229-152864-0027 NEARLY THE ONLY FOOLISH THING YOU EVER DID WAS TO RUN FROM OUR DEAD I PRESSED THE HORSE'S RIBS AND HE WAS OFF LIKE A SUDDEN WIND I GAVE HIM A PAT ON THE SIDE OF THE NECK AND HE WENT ABOUT IN A SHARP DRIVEN CURVE
2229-152864-0028 CLOSE TO THE GROUND LIKE A CAT WHEN SCRATCHINGLY SHE WHEELS ABOUT AFTER A MOUSE LEANING SIDEWAYS TILL HIS MANE SWEPT THE TOPS OF THE HEATHER THROUGH THE DARK I HEARD THE WINGS OF THE RAVEN
2229-152864-0029 FIVE QUICK FLAPS I HEARD AND HE PERCHED ON THE HORSE'S HEAD THE HORSE CHECKED HIMSELF INSTANTLY PLOUGHING UP THE GROUND WITH HIS FEET MISTER VANE CROAKED THE RAVEN THINK WHAT YOU ARE DOING
2229-152864-0030 TWICE ALREADY HAS EVIL BEFALLEN YOU ONCE FROM FEAR AND ONCE FROM HEEDLESSNESS BREACH OF WORD IS FAR WORSE IT IS A CRIME THE LITTLE ONES ARE IN FRIGHTFUL PERIL AND I BROUGHT IT UPON THEM
2229-152864-0031 I CRIED BUT INDEED I WILL NOT BREAK MY WORD TO YOU I WILL RETURN AND SPEND IN YOUR HOUSE WHAT NIGHTS WHAT DAYS WHAT YEARS YOU PLEASE I TELL YOU ONCE MORE YOU WILL DO THEM
2229-152864-0032 OTHER THAN GOOD IF YOU GO TO NIGHT HE INSISTED BUT A FALSE SENSE OF POWER A SENSE WHICH HAD NO ROOT AND WAS MERELY VIBRATED INTO ME FROM THE STRENGTH OF THE HORSE HAD ALAS RENDERED ME TOO STUPID TO LISTEN TO ANYTHING HE SAID
2229-152864-0033 IT IS MY DUTY AND I WILL GO IF I PERISH FOR IT GO THEN FOOLISH BOY HE RETURNED WITH ANGER IN HIS CROAK TAKE THE HORSE AND RIDE TO FAILURE MAY IT BE TO HUMILITY
2229-152864-0034 HE SPREAD HIS WINGS AND FLEW AGAIN I PRESSED THE LEAN RIBS UNDER ME AFTER THE SPOTTED LEOPARDESS I WHISPERED IN HIS EAR HE TURNED HIS HEAD THIS WAY AND THAT SNUFFING THE AIR THEN STARTED
2229-152864-0035 AND WENT A FEW PACES IN A SLOW UNDECIDED WALK SUDDENLY HE QUICKENED HIS WALK BROKE INTO A TROT BEGAN TO GALLOP AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HIS SPEED WAS TREMENDOUS HE SEEMED TO SEE IN THE DARK NEVER STUMBLED NOT ONCE FALTERED
2229-152864-0036 NOT ONCE HESITATED I SAT AS ON THE RIDGE OF A WAVE I FELT UNDER ME THE PLAY OF EACH INDIVIDUAL MUSCLE HIS JOINTS WERE SO ELASTIC AND HIS EVERY MOVEMENT GLIDED SO INTO THE NEXT THAT NOT ONCE DID HE JAR ME
2229-152864-0037 HIS GROWING SWIFTNESS BORE HIM ALONG UNTIL HE FLEW RATHER THAN RAN THE WIND MET AND PASSED US LIKE A TORNADO ACROSS THE EVIL HOLLOW WE SPED LIKE A BOLT FROM AN ARBLAST
2229-152864-0038 NO MONSTER LIFTED ITS NECK ALL KNEW THE HOOFS THAT THUNDERED OVER THEIR HEADS WE RUSHED UP THE HILLS WE SHOT DOWN THEIR FARTHER SLOPES FROM THE ROCKY CHASMS OF THE RIVER BED HE DID NOT SWERVE HE HELD ON OVER THEM HIS FIERCE
2229-152864-0039 TERRIBLE GALLOP THE MOON HALF WAY UP THE HEAVEN GAZED WITH A SOLEMN TROUBLE IN HER PALE COUNTENANCE REJOICING IN THE POWER OF MY STEED AND IN THE PRIDE OF MY LIFE I SAT LIKE A KING AND RODE
2229-152864-0040 WE WERE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE MANY CHANNELS MY HORSE EVERY OTHER MOMENT CLEARING ONE SOMETIMES TWO IN HIS STRIDE AND NOW AND THEN GATHERING HIMSELF FOR A GREAT BOUNDING LEAP WHEN THE MOON REACHED THE KEY STONE OF HER ARCH
2229-152864-0041 THEN CAME A WONDER AND A TERROR SHE BEGAN TO DESCEND ROLLING LIKE THE NAVE OF FORTUNE'S WHEEL BOWLED BY THE GODS AND WENT FASTER AND FASTER LIKE OUR OWN MOON THIS ONE HAD A HUMAN FACE
2229-152864-0042 AND NOW THE BROAD FOREHEAD NOW THE CHIN WAS UPPERMOST AS SHE ROLLED I GAZED AGHAST ACROSS THE RAVINES CAME THE HOWLING OF WOLVES
2229-152864-0043 AN UGLY FEAR BEGAN TO INVADE THE HOLLOW PLACES OF MY HEART MY CONFIDENCE WAS ON THE WANE THE HORSE MAINTAINED HIS HEADLONG SWIFTNESS WITH EARS PRICKED FORWARD AND THIRSTY NOSTRILS EXULTING IN THE WIND HIS CAREER CREATED
2229-152864-0044 BUT THERE WAS THE MOON JOLTING LIKE AN OLD CHARIOT WHEEL DOWN THE HILL OF HEAVEN WITH AWFUL BODING SHE ROLLED AT LAST OVER THE HORIZON EDGE AND DISAPPEARED CARRYING ALL HER LIGHT WITH HER
2229-152864-0045 THE MIGHTY STEED WAS IN THE ACT OF CLEARING A WIDE SHALLOW CHANNEL WHEN WE WERE CAUGHT IN THE NET OF THE DARKNESS HIS HEAD DROPPED ITS IMPETUS CARRIED HIS HELPLESS BULK ACROSS
2229-152864-0046 AND WHERE HE FELL HE LAY I GOT UP KNEELED BESIDE HIM AND FELT HIM ALL OVER NOT A BONE COULD I FIND BROKEN BUT HE WAS A HORSE NO MORE
