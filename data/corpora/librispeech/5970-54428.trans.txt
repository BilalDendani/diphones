5970-54428-0000 MISTER SKAGGS HAD NO QUALMS OF CONSCIENCE ABOUT THE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD COME BY THE DAMAGING EVIDENCE AGAINST MAURICE OAKLEY IT WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM THAT HE HAD IT
5970-54428-0001 A CORPORATION HE ARGUED HAD NO SOUL AND THEREFORE NO CONSCIENCE HOW MUCH LESS THEN SHOULD SO SMALL A PART OF A GREAT CORPORATION AS HIMSELF
5970-54428-0002 BE EXPECTED TO HAVE THEM HE HAD HIS STORY IT WAS VIVID INTERESTING DRAMATIC IT MEANT THE FAVOUR OF HIS EDITOR
5970-54428-0003 A BIG THING FOR THE UNIVERSE AND A FATTER LINING FOR HIS OWN POCKET HE SAT DOWN TO PUT HIS DISCOVERY ON PAPER BEFORE HE ATTEMPTED ANYTHING ELSE
5970-54428-0004 ALTHOUGH THE IMPULSE TO CELEBRATE WAS VERY STRONG WITHIN HIM HE TOLD HIS STORY WELL WITH AN EYE TO EVERY ONE OF ITS SALIENT POINTS
5970-54428-0005 HE SENT AN ALLEGED PICTURE OF BERRY HAMILTON AS HE HAD APPEARED AT THE TIME OF HIS ARREST HE SENT A PICTURE OF THE OAKLEY HOME AND OF THE COTTAGE WHERE THE SERVANT AND HIS FAMILY
5970-54428-0006 HAD BEEN SO HAPPY THERE WAS A STRONG PEN PICTURE OF THE MAN OAKLEY GROWN HAGGARD AND MOROSE FROM CARRYING HIS GUILTY SECRET OF HIS CONFUSION WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THE
5970-54428-0007 SUPPOSED KNOWLEDGE OF IT THE OLD SOUTHERN CITY WAS DESCRIBED AND THE OPINIONS OF ITS RESIDENTS IN REGARD TO THE CASE GIVEN IT WAS THERE
5970-54428-0008 CLEAR INTERESTING AND STRONG ONE COULD SEE IT ALL AS IF EVERY PHASE OF IT WERE BEING ENACTED BEFORE ONE'S EYES SKAGGS SURPASSED HIMSELF
5970-54428-0009 WHEN THE EDITOR FIRST GOT HOLD OF IT HE SAID HUH OVER THE OPENING LINES A FEW SHORT SENTENCES
5970-54428-0010 THAT INSTANTLY PRICKED THE ATTENTION AWAKE HE READ ON WITH INCREASING INTEREST THIS IS GOOD STUFF HE SAID AT THE LAST PAGE
5970-54428-0011 HERE S A CHANCE FOR THE UNIVERSE TO LOOK INTO THE METHODS OF SOUTHERN COURT PROCEEDINGS
5970-54428-0012 THE UNIVERSE HAD ALWAYS CLAIMED TO BE THE FRIEND OF ALL POOR AND OPPRESSED HUMANITY AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE IT DID SOMETHING TO SUBSTANTIATE ITS CLAIM
5970-54428-0013 WHEREUPON IT STOOD OFF AND SAID TO THE PUBLIC LOOK YOU WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND BEHOLD HOW GREAT WE ARE THE FRIEND OF THE PEOPLE THE UNIVERSE WAS YELLOW
5970-54428-0014 IT WAS VERY SO BUT IT HAD POWER AND KEENNESS AND ENERGY IT NEVER LOST AN OPPORTUNITY TO CROW AND IF ONE WAS NOT FORTHCOMING IT MADE ONE
5970-54428-0015 IN THIS WAY IT MANAGED TO DO A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF GOOD AND ITS YELLOWNESS BECAME FORGIVABLE EVEN COMMENDABLE IN SKAGGS'S STORY THE EDITOR SAW
5970-54428-0016 AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ONE OF ITS PERIODICAL PHILANTHROPIES HE SEIZED UPON IT WITH HEADLINES THAT TOOK HALF A PAGE AND WITH CUTS AUTHENTIC AND OTHERWISE
5970-54428-0017 THE TALE WAS TOLD AND THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK WERE GREETED NEXT MORNING WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A BURNING SHAME A POOR AND INNOCENT NEGRO MADE TO SUFFER FOR A RICH MAN'S CRIME
5970-54428-0018 A UNIVERSE REPORTER TO THE RESCUE THE WHOLE THING TO BE AIRED THAT THE PEOPLE MAY KNOW
5970-54428-0019 THEN SKAGGS RECEIVED A TELEGRAM THAT MADE HIM LEAP FOR JOY HE WAS TO DO IT HE WAS TO GO TO THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE HE WAS TO BEARD THE GOVERNOR IN HIS DEN
5970-54428-0020 AND HE WITH THE FORCE OF A GREAT PAPER BEHIND HIM WAS TO DEMAND FOR THE PEOPLE THE RELEASE OF AN INNOCENT MAN THEN THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER WRITE UP AND MUCH GLORY FOR HIM AND MORE SHEKELS
5970-54428-0021 IN AN HOUR AFTER HE HAD RECEIVED HIS TELEGRAM HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE SOUTHERN CAPITAL MEANWHILE IN THE HOUSE OF MAURICE OAKLEY THERE WERE SAD TIMES
5970-54428-0022 FROM THE MOMENT THAT THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE HAD FALLEN TO THE FLOOR IN IMPOTENT FEAR AND MADNESS THERE HAD BEEN NO PEACE WITHIN HIS DOORS AT FIRST HIS WIFE HAD TRIED TO CONTROL HIM ALONE
5970-54428-0023 AND HAD HUMOURED THE WILD BABBLINGS WITH WHICH HE WOKE FROM HIS SWOON BUT THESE CHANGED TO SHRIEKS AND CRIES AND CURSES
5970-54428-0024 AND SHE WAS FORCED TO THROW OPEN THE DOORS SO LONG CLOSED AND CALL IN HELP THE NEIGHBOURS AND HER OLD FRIENDS WENT TO HER ASSISTANCE AND WHAT THE REPORTER'S STORY HAD NOT DONE
5970-54428-0025 THE RAVINGS OF THE MAN ACCOMPLISHED FOR WITH A SHOW OF MATCHLESS CUNNING HE CONTINUALLY CLUTCHED AT HIS BREAST LAUGHED AND BABBLED HIS SECRET OPENLY
5970-54428-0026 EVEN THEN THEY WOULD HAVE SMOTHERED IT IN SILENCE FOR THE HONOUR OF ONE OF THEIR BEST FAMILIES BUT TOO MANY EARS HAD HEARD AND THEN CAME THE YELLOW JOURNAL
5970-54428-0027 BEARING ALL THE NEWS IN EMBLAZONED HEADLINES COLONEL SAUNDERS WAS DISTINCTLY HURT TO THINK THAT HIS CONFIDENCE HAD BEEN IMPOSED ON AND THAT
5970-54428-0028 HE HAD BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN BRINGING SHAME UPON A SOUTHERN NAME TO THINK SUH HE SAID GENERALLY TO THE USUAL ASSEMBLY OF CHOICE SPIRITS TO THINK OF THAT
5970-54428-0029 MAN'S BEING A REPORTER SUH A COMMON ORDINARY REPORTER AND THAT I SAT AND TALKED TO HIM AS IF HE WERE A GENTLEMAN
5970-54428-0030 SAID OLD HORACE TALBOT YOU VE DONE NO MORE THAN ANY OTHER GENTLEMAN WOULD HAVE DONE
5970-54428-0031 HAS NO SENSE OF HONOUR SUH NO SENSE OF HONOUR IF THIS PARTICULAR MAN HAD HAD HE WOULD HAVE KEPT STILL AND EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE GONE ON SMOOTH AND QUIET
5970-54428-0032 INSTEAD OF THAT A DISTINGUISHED FAMILY IS BROUGHT TO SHAME AND FOR WHAT TO GIVE A NIGGER A FEW MORE YEARS OF FREEDOM WHEN LIKELY AS NOT
5970-54428-0033 HE DON'T WANT IT AND BERRY HAMILTON'S LIFE IN PRISON HAS PROVED NEARER THE IDEAL REACHED BY SLAVERY THAN ANYTHING HE HAS FOUND SINCE EMANCIPATION WHY SUHS
5970-54428-0034 I FANCY I SEE HIM LEAVING HIS PRISON WITH TEARS OF REGRET IN HIS EYES OLD HORACE WAS INANELY ELOQUENT FOR AN HOUR OVER HIS PET THEORY
5970-54428-0035 BUT THERE WERE SOME IN THE TOWN WHO THOUGHT DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE MATTER AND IT WAS THEIR OPINIONS AND MURMURINGS THAT BACKED UP SKAGGS AND MADE IT EASIER FOR HIM WHEN AT THE CAPITAL
5970-54428-0036 HE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE OFFICIAL RED TAPE HE WAS TOLD THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN FORMS OF PROCEDURE AND CERTAIN TIMES FOR CERTAIN THINGS BUT HE HAMMERED PERSISTENTLY AWAY
5970-54428-0037 THE MURMURINGS BEHIND HIM GREW LOUDER WHILE FROM HIS SANCTUM THE EDITOR OF THE UNIVERSE THUNDERED AWAY AGAINST OPPRESSION AND HIGH HANDED TYRANNY OTHER PAPERS TOOK IT UP
5970-54428-0038 AND ASKED WHY THIS MAN SHOULD BE DESPOILED OF HIS LIBERTY ANY LONGER AND WHEN IT WAS REPLIED THAT THE MAN HAD BEEN CONVICTED AND THAT THE WHEELS OF JUSTICE COULD NOT BE STOPPED OR TURNED BACK
5970-54428-0039 BY THE LETTER OF A ROMANTIC ARTIST OR THE RAVINGS OF A MADMAN THERE WAS A MIGHTY OUTCRY AGAINST THE FARCE OF JUSTICE THAT HAD BEEN PLAYED OUT IN THIS MAN'S CASE
5970-54428-0040 THE TRIAL WAS REVIEWED THE EVIDENCE AGAIN BROUGHT UP AND EXAMINED THE DIGNITY OF THE STATE WAS THREATENED AT THIS TIME THE STATE
5970-54428-0041 TO SAVE ITS TOTTERING REPUTATION IT WOULD NOT SURRENDER BUT IT CAPITULATED AND BERRY HAMILTON WAS PARDONED
5970-54428-0042 BERRY HEARD THE NEWS WITH SURPRISE AND A HALF BITTER JOY HE HAD LONG AGO LOST HOPE THAT JUSTICE WOULD EVER BE DONE TO HIM HE MARVELLED AT THE WORD
5970-54428-0043 AND HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE STRANGE CORDIALITY OF THE YOUNG WHITE MAN WHO MET HIM AT THE WARDEN'S OFFICE FIVE YEARS OF PRISON LIFE HAD MADE A DIFFERENT MAN OF HIM
5970-54428-0044 HE NO LONGER LOOKED TO RECEIVE KINDNESS FROM HIS FELLOWS AND HE BLINKED AT IT
5970-54428-0045 BRIGHTNESS OF THE SUN THE LINES ABOUT HIS MOUTH WHERE THE SMILES USED TO GATHER HAD CHANGED AND GROWN STERN WITH THE HOPELESSNESS OF YEARS
5970-54428-0046 HIS LIPS DROOPED PATHETICALLY AND HARD TREATMENT HAD GIVEN HIS EYES A LOWERING LOOK HIS HAIR
5970-54428-0047 THAT HAD HARDLY SHOWN A WHITE STREAK WAS AS WHITE AS MAURICE OAKLEY'S OWN HIS ERSTWHILE QUICK WITS WERE DULLED AND IMBRUTED
5970-54428-0048 HE HAD LIVED LIKE AN OX WORKING WITHOUT INSPIRATION OR REWARD AND HE CAME FORTH LIKE AN OX FROM HIS STALL
5970-54428-0049 ALL THE HIGHER PART OF HIM HE HAD LEFT BEHIND DROPPING IT OFF DAY AFTER DAY THROUGH THE WEARISOME YEARS HE HAD
5970-54428-0050 PUT BEHIND HIM THE BERRY HAMILTON THAT LAUGHED AND JOKED AND SANG AND BELIEVED FOR EVEN HIS FAITH
5970-54428-0051 SHAKING HIS HAND HEARTILY BERRY DID NOT ANSWER WHAT HAD THIS SLIM GLIB YOUNG MAN TO DO WITH HIM WHAT HAD ANY WHITE MAN
5970-54428-0052 TO DO WITH HIM AFTER WHAT HE HAD SUFFERED AT THEIR HANDS YOU KNOW YOU ARE TO GO NEW YORK WITH ME TO NEW YAWK
5970-54428-0053 SKAGGS DID NOT TELL HIM THAT NOW THAT THE UNIVERSE HAD DONE ITS WORK IT DEMANDED THE RIGHT TO CROW TO ITS HEART'S SATISFACTION HE SAID ONLY
5970-54428-0054 YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR WIFE OF COURSE BERRY HAD FORGOTTEN FANNIE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HIS HEART THRILLED WITHIN HIM AT THE THOUGHT OF SEEING HER AGAIN
5970-54428-0055 TIME I
5970-54428-0056 BECOME OF EM HOW S KIT AN JOE
5970-54428-0057 IN THIS THE FIRST HOUR OF HIS FREEDOM LET HIM HAVE TIME TO DRINK THE SWEETNESS OF THAT ALL IN THERE WOULD BE TIME AFTERWARDS TO TASTE ALL OF THE BITTERNESS
5970-54428-0058 ONCE IN NEW YORK HE FOUND THAT PEOPLE WISHED TO SEE HIM SOME FOOLS SOME PHILANTHROPISTS AND A GREAT MANY REPORTERS
5970-54428-0059 HE HAD TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED ALL THIS BEFORE HE COULD SEEK THOSE WHOM HE LONGED TO SEE THEY PRINTED HIS PICTURE AS HE WAS BEFORE HE WENT TO PRISON
5970-54428-0060 AND AS HE WAS NOW A SORT OF BEFORE AND AFTER TAKING COMMENT AND IN THE MORNING THAT IT ALL APPEARED WHEN THE UNIVERSE SPREAD ITSELF
5970-54428-0061 TO TELL THE PUBLIC WHAT IT HAD DONE AND HOW IT HAD DONE IT THEY GAVE HIM HIS WIFE'S ADDRESS IT WOULD BE BETTER THEY THOUGHT FOR HER TO TELL HIM HERSELF
5970-54428-0062 ALL THAT HAPPENED NO ONE OF THEM WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO STAND TO LOOK IN HIS EYES WHEN HE ASKED FOR HIS SON AND DAUGHTER AND THEY SHIFTED THEIR RESPONSIBILITY
5970-54428-0063 BY PRETENDING TO THEMSELVES THAT THEY WERE DOING IT FOR HIS OWN GOOD
5970-54428-0064 WHO HAD BEEN HIS WIFE BERRY TOOK THE ADDRESS AND INQUIRED HIS WAY TIMIDLY HESITATINGLY BUT WITH A SWELLING HEART TO THE DOOR OF THE FLAT
