3819-134145-0000 A RIDE ON A LION THE NEXT DAY GLIDED AWAY PLEASANTLY ENOUGH PARTLY IN SETTLING MYSELF IN MY NEW QUARTERS AND PARTLY IN STROLLING ROUND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD UNDER ARTHUR'S GUIDANCE
3819-134145-0001 AND TRYING TO FORM A GENERAL IDEA OF ELVESTON AND ITS INHABITANTS WHEN FIVE O'CLOCK ARRIVED ARTHUR PROPOSED WITHOUT ANY EMBARRASSMENT THIS TIME TO TAKE ME WITH HIM UP TO THE HALL
3819-134145-0002 IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE EARL OF AINSLIE WHO HAD TAKEN IT FOR THE SEASON AND RENEW ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIS DAUGHTER LADY MURIEL
3819-134145-0003 MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THE GENTLE DIGNIFIED AND YET GENIAL OLD MAN WERE ENTIRELY FAVOURABLE AND THE REAL SATISFACTION THAT SHOWED ITSELF ON HIS DAUGHTER'S FACE AS SHE MET ME WITH THE WORDS
3819-134145-0004 WAS VERY SOOTHING FOR WHATEVER REMAINS OF PERSONAL VANITY THE FAILURES AND DISAPPOINTMENTS OF MANY LONG YEARS AND MUCH BUFFETING WITH A ROUGH WORLD HAD LEFT IN ME YET I NOTED AND WAS GLAD TO NOTE
3819-134145-0005 IN HER MEETING WITH ARTHUR THOUGH THIS WAS AS I GATHERED AN ALMOST DAILY OCCURRENCE AND THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEM IN WHICH THE EARL AND I WERE ONLY OCCASIONAL SHARERS
3819-134145-0006 RARELY MET WITH EXCEPT BETWEEN VERY OLD FRIENDS AND AS I KNEW THAT THEY HAD NOT KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR A LONGER PERIOD THAN THE SUMMER WHICH WAS NOW ROUNDING INTO AUTUMN I FELT CERTAIN THAT LOVE
3819-134145-0007 AND LOVE ALONE COULD EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON HOW CONVENIENT IT WOULD BE
3819-134145-0008 LADY MURIEL LAUGHINGLY REMARKED A PROPOS OF MY HAVING INSISTED ON SAVING HER THE TROUBLE OF CARRYING A CUP OF TEA ACROSS THE ROOM TO THE EARL IF CUPS OF TEA HAD NO WEIGHT AT ALL THEN PERHAPS
3819-134145-0009 SAID THE EARL TELL US HOW IT COULD BE WE SHALL NEVER GUESS IT WELL SUPPOSE THIS HOUSE JUST AS IT IS PLACED A FEW BILLION MILES ABOVE A PLANET AND WITH NOTHING ELSE NEAR ENOUGH TO DISTURB IT
3819-134145-0010 OF COURSE IT FALLS TO THE PLANET THE EARL NODDED
3819-134145-0011 AND IS FIVE O'CLOCK TEA TO BE GOING ON ALL THE WHILE SAID LADY MURIEL THAT AND OTHER THINGS SAID ARTHUR THE INHABITANTS WOULD LIVE THEIR LIVES GROW UP AND DIE
3819-134145-0012 AND STILL THE HOUSE WOULD BE FALLING FALLING FALLING BUT NOW AS TO THE RELATIVE WEIGHT OF THINGS NOTHING CAN BE HEAVY YOU KNOW EXCEPT BY TRYING TO FALL AND BEING PREVENTED FROM DOING SO YOU ALL GRANT THAT
3819-134145-0013 WE ALL GRANTED THAT WELL NOW IF I TAKE THIS BOOK AND HOLD IT OUT AT ARM'S LENGTH OF COURSE I FEEL ITS WEIGHT IT IS TRYING TO FALL AND I PREVENT IT
3819-134145-0014 BUT IF WE WERE ALL FALLING TOGETHER IT COULDN'T BE TRYING TO FALL ANY QUICKER YOU KNOW FOR IF I LET GO WHAT MORE COULD IT DO THAN FALL AND AS MY HAND WOULD BE FALLING TOO AT THE SAME RATE
3819-134145-0015 IT WOULD NEVER LEAVE IT FOR THAT WOULD BE TO GET AHEAD OF IT IN THE RACE AND IT COULD NEVER OVERTAKE THE FAILING FLOOR
3819-134145-0016 HOW CAN YOU MAKE US DO IT THERE IS A MORE CURIOUS IDEA YET I VENTURED TO SAY SUPPOSE A CORD FASTENED TO THE HOUSE FROM BELOW AND PULLED DOWN BY SOME ONE ON THE PLANET
3819-134145-0017 THEN OF COURSE THE HOUSE GOES FASTER THAN ITS NATURAL RATE OF FALLING BUT THE FURNITURE WITH OUR NOBLE SELVES
3819-134145-0018 SAID THE EARL THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF WHICH WOULD BE CONCUSSION OF BRAIN TO AVOID THAT SAID ARTHUR LET US HAVE THE FURNITURE FIXED TO THE FLOOR AND OURSELVES TIED DOWN TO THE FURNITURE
3819-134145-0019 THEN THE FIVE O'CLOCK TEA COULD GO ON IN PEACE WITH ONE LITTLE DRAWBACK LADY MURIEL GAILY INTERRUPTED WE SHOULD TAKE THE CUPS DOWN WITH US BUT WHAT ABOUT THE TEA
3819-134145-0020 I HAD FORGOTTEN THE TEA ARTHUR CONFESSED THAT NO DOUBT WOULD RISE TO THE CEILING UNLESS YOU CHOSE TO DRINK IT ON THE WAY
3819-134145-0021 IS QUITE NONSENSE ENOUGH FOR ONE WHILE SAID THE EARL
3819-134145-0022 THIS DREW ME INTO THE CONVERSATION WHICH NOW TOOK A MORE CONVENTIONAL TONE AFTER A WHILE ARTHUR GAVE THE SIGNAL FOR OUR DEPARTURE AND IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING WE STROLLED DOWN TO THE BEACH
3819-134145-0023 ENJOYING THE SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY THE MURMUR OF THE SEA AND THE FAR AWAY MUSIC OF SOME FISHERMEN'S SONG ALMOST AS MUCH AS OUR LATE PLEASANT TALK WE SAT DOWN AMONG THE ROCKS
3819-134145-0024 BY A LITTLE POOL SO RICH IN ANIMAL VEGETABLE AND ZOOPHYTIC OR WHATEVER IS THE RIGHT WORD LIFE THAT I BECAME ENTRANCED IN THE STUDY OF IT AND WHEN ARTHUR PROPOSED RETURNING TO OUR LODGINGS
3819-134145-0025 I BEGGED TO BE LEFT THERE FOR A WHILE TO WATCH AND MUSE ALONE THE FISHERMEN'S SONG GREW EVER NEARER AND CLEARER AS THEIR BOAT STOOD IN FOR THE BEACH AND I WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN TO SEE THEM LAND THEIR CARGO OF FISH
3819-134145-0026 HAD NOT THE MICROCOSM AT MY FEET STIRRED MY CURIOSITY YET MORE KEENLY ONE ANCIENT CRAB THAT WAS FOR EVER SHUFFLING FRANTICALLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE OF THE POOL
3819-134145-0027 HE'S NOT HUNGRY BUT WE WANT TO SEE HIM SO WILL YOU PLEASE
3819-134145-0028 AND HE FLUNG THE DOOR OPEN AND LET US OUT UPON THE DUSTY HIGH ROAD WE SOON FOUND OUR WAY TO THE BUSH WHICH HAD SO MYSTERIOUSLY SUNK INTO THE GROUND AND HERE
3819-134145-0029 SYLVIE DREW THE MAGIC LOCKET FROM ITS HIDING PLACE TURNED IT OVER WITH A THOUGHTFUL AIR AND AT LAST APPEALED TO BRUNO IN A RATHER HELPLESS WAY WHAT WAS IT WE HAD TO DO WITH IT BRUNO
3819-134145-0030 IT'S ALL GONE OUT OF MY HEAD KISS IT WAS BRUNO'S INVARIABLE RECIPE IN CASES OF DOUBT AND DIFFICULTY SYLVIE KISSED IT BUT NO RESULT FOLLOWED
3819-134145-0031 WAS BRUNO'S NEXT SUGGESTION WHICH IS THE WRONG WAY SYLVIE MOST REASONABLY ENQUIRED THE OBVIOUS PLAN WAS TO TRY BOTH WAYS RUBBING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT HAD NO VISIBLE EFFECT WHATEVER
3819-134145-0032 FOR A NUMBER OF TREES ON THE NEIGHBOURING HILLSIDE WERE MOVING SLOWLY UPWARDS IN SOLEMN PROCESSION WHILE A MILD LITTLE BROOK THAT HAD BEEN RIPPLING AT OUR FEET A MOMENT BEFORE
3819-134145-0033 AND HISS AND BUBBLE
3819-134145-0034 UP AND DOWN DID IT AND THE LANDSCAPE WHICH HAD BEEN SHOWING SIGNS OF MENTAL ABERRATION IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS RETURNED TO ITS NORMAL CONDITION OF SOBRIETY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL YELLOWISH BROWN MOUSE
3819-134145-0035 WHICH CONTINUED TO RUN WILDLY UP AND DOWN THE ROAD LASHING ITS TAIL LIKE A LITTLE LION LET'S FOLLOW IT SAID SYLVIE
3819-134145-0036 THE MOUSE AT ONCE SETTLED DOWN INTO A BUSINESS LIKE JOG TROT WITH WHICH WE COULD EASILY KEEP PACE THE ONLY PHENOMENON THAT GAVE ME ANY UNEASINESS
3819-134145-0037 WAS THE RAPID INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE LITTLE CREATURE WE WERE FOLLOWING WHICH BECAME EVERY MOMENT MORE AND MORE LIKE A REAL LION
3819-134145-0038 AND SEATED HERSELF BEHIND HIM PILLION FASHION BRUNO TOOK A GOOD HANDFUL OF MANE IN EACH HAND
3819-134145-0039 THE LION AT ONCE BROKE INTO AN EASY CANTER AND WE SOON FOUND OURSELVES IN THE DEPTHS OF THE FOREST I SAY WE FOR I AM CERTAIN THAT I ACCOMPANIED THEM
3819-134145-0040 THOUGH HOW I MANAGED TO KEEP UP WITH A CANTERING LION I AM WHOLLY UNABLE TO EXPLAIN BUT I WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHEN WE CAME UPON AN OLD BEGGAR MAN CUTTING STICKS AT WHOSE FEET
3819-134145-0041 THE LION MADE A PROFOUND OBEISANCE SYLVIE AND BRUNO AT THE SAME MOMENT DISMOUNTING AND LEAPING IN TO THE ARMS OF THEIR FATHER
3819-134145-0042 THE OLD MAN SAID TO HIMSELF DREAMILY WHEN THE CHILDREN HAD FINISHED THEIR RATHER CONFUSED ACCOUNT OF THE AMBASSADOR'S VISIT GATHERED NO DOUBT FROM GENERAL REPORT AS THEY HAD NOT SEEN HIM THEMSELVES FROM BAD TO WORSE
3819-134145-0043 THAT IS THEIR DESTINY I SEE IT BUT I CANNOT ALTER IT THE SELFISHNESS OF A MEAN AND CRAFTY MAN THE SELFISHNESS OF AN AMBITIOUS AND SILLY WOMAN THE SELFISHNESS OF A SPITEFUL AND LOVELESS CHILD
3819-134145-0044 ALL TEND ONE WAY FROM BAD TO WORSE AND YOU MY DARLINGS MUST SUFFER IT AWHILE I FEAR YET WHEN THINGS ARE AT THEIR WORST YOU CAN COME TO ME
3819-134145-0045 GATHERING UP A HANDFUL OF DUST AND SCATTERING IT IN THE AIR HE SLOWLY AND SOLEMNLY PRONOUNCED SOME WORDS THAT SOUNDED LIKE A CHARM THE CHILDREN LOOKING ON IN AWE STRUCK SILENCE
3819-134145-0046 AMBITION SPITE BE QUENCHED IN REASON'S NIGHT
3819-134145-0047 TILL WHAT IS DARK BE LIGHT TILL WHAT IS WRONG
3819-134145-0048 A DISCORDANT VOICE YELLED IN OUR EARS WERE
