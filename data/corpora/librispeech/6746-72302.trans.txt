6746-72302-0000 THERE'S NO GOOD IN HIM SAID HIS STEPMOTHER NOT A MOSSUL WITH THESE WORDS SHE THRUST LITTLE JOE FORWARD BY APPLYING HER KNEE TO THE SMALL OF HIS BACK
6746-72302-0001 AND THEREBY JERKING HIM INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE SCHOOL BEFORE THE MASTER THERE'S NO MAKING NOTHING OUT OF HIM WHACK HIM AS YOU WILL LITTLE JOE LAMBOLE WAS A CHILD OF TEN DRESSED IN SECOND HAND NAY
6746-72302-0002 THIRD HAND GARMENTS THAT DID NOT FIT HIS COAT HAD BEEN A SOLDIER'S SCARLET UNIFORM THAT HAD GONE WHEN DISCARDED TO A DEALER WHO HAD DEALT IT TO A CARTER AND WHEN THE CARTER HAD WORN IT OUT IT WAS REDUCED AND ADAPTED TO THE WEAR OF THE CHILD
6746-72302-0003 THE NETHER GARMENTS HAD IN LIKE MANNER SERVED A FULL GROWN MAN TILL WORN OUT THEN THEY HAD BEEN CUT DOWN AT THE KNEES THOUGH SHORTENED IN LEG THEY MAINTAINED THEIR FORMER COPIOUSNESS OF SEAT AND SERVED AS AN INEXHAUSTIBLE RECEPTACLE FOR DUST
6746-72302-0004 OFTEN AS LITTLE JOE WAS LICKED
6746-72302-0005 ONLY A SEVEN MONTH CHILD SAID MISSUS LAMBOLE CONTEMPTUOUSLY BORN WITHOUT HIS NAILS ON FINGERS AND TOES THEY GROWED LATER HIS WITS HAVE NEVER COME RIGHT AND A DEAL
6746-72302-0006 USE THE ROD WE WON'T GRUMBLE AT YOU FOR DOING SO LITTLE JOE LAMBOLE WHEN HE CAME INTO THE WORLD HAD NOT BEEN EXPECTED TO LIVE
6746-72302-0007 THAT COULD NOT ROAR BUT WHIMPERED HE HAD BEEN PRIVATELY BAPTISED DIRECTLY HE WAS BORN BECAUSE AT THE FIRST MISSUS LAMBOLE SAID THE CHILD IS MINE THOUGH IT BE SUCH A CREETUR AND I WOULDN'T LIKE IT ACCORDING TO BE BURIED LIKE A DOG
6746-72302-0008 HE WAS CALLED JOSEPH THE SCRIPTURAL JOSEPH HAD BEEN SOLD AS A BONDMAN INTO EGYPT THIS LITTLE JOSEPH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE WORLD TO BE A SLAVE IN ALL PROPRIETY HE OUGHT TO HAVE DIED AS A BABY AND THAT HAPPY CONSUMMATION WAS ALMOST DESIRED
6746-72302-0009 BUT HE DISAPPOINTED EXPECTATIONS AND LIVED HIS MOTHER DIED SOON AFTER AND HIS FATHER MARRIED AGAIN AND HIS FATHER AND STEPMOTHER LOVED HIM DOUBTLESS BUT LOVE IS MANIFESTED IN MANY WAYS AND THE LAMBOLES SHOWED THEIRS IN A ROUGH WAY
6746-72302-0010 BY SLAPS AND BLOWS AND KICKS THE FATHER WAS ASHAMED OF HIM BECAUSE HE WAS A WEAKLING AND THE STEPMOTHER BECAUSE HE WAS UGLY AND WAS NOT HER OWN CHILD HE WAS A MEAGRE LITTLE FELLOW WITH A LONG NECK AND A WHITE FACE AND SUNKEN CHEEKS
6746-72302-0011 A PIGEON BREAST AND A BIG STOMACH HE WALKED WITH HIS HEAD FORWARD AND HIS GREAT PALE BLUE EYES STARING BEFORE HIM INTO THE FAR DISTANCE AS IF HE WERE ALWAYS LOOKING OUT OF THE WORLD HIS WALK WAS A WADDLE
6746-72302-0012 AND HE TUMBLED OVER EVERY OBSTACLE BECAUSE HE NEVER LOOKED WHERE HE WAS GOING ALWAYS LOOKED TO SOMETHING BEYOND THE HORIZON BECAUSE OF HIS WALK AND HIS LONG NECK AND STARING EYES AND BIG STOMACH THE VILLAGE CHILDREN CALLED HIM GANDER JOE OR JOE GANDER
6746-72302-0013 AND HIS PARENTS WERE NOT SORRY FOR THEY WERE ASHAMED THAT SUCH A CREATURE SHOULD BE KNOWN AS A LAMBOLE THE LAMBOLES WERE A STURDY HEARTY PEOPLE WITH CHEEKS LIKE QUARRENDER APPLES AND BONES SET FIRM AND KNIT WITH IRON SINEWS
6746-72302-0014 THEY WERE A HARD WORKING PRACTICAL PEOPLE WHO FATTENED PIGS AND KEPT POULTRY AT HOME LAMBOLE WAS A ROADMAKER IN BREAKING STONES ONE DAY A BIT OF ONE HAD STRUCK HIS EYE AND BLINDED IT AFTER THAT HE WORE A BLACK PATCH UPON IT
6746-72302-0015 HE SAW WELL ENOUGH OUT OF THE OTHER HE NEVER MISSED SEEING HIS OWN INTERESTS LAMBOLE COULD HAVE MADE A FEW PENCE WITH HIS SON HAD HIS SON BEEN WORTH ANYTHING HE COULD HAVE SENT HIM TO SCRAPE THE ROAD AND BRING THE MANURE OFF IT IN A SHOVEL TO HIS GARDEN
6746-72302-0016 BUT JOE NEVER TOOK HEARTILY TO SCRAPING THE DUNG UP IN A WORD THE BOY WAS GOOD FOR NOTHING HE HAD HAIR LIKE TOW AND A LITTLE STRAW HAT ON HIS HEAD WITH THE TOP TORN SO THAT THE HAIR FORCED ITS WAY OUT
6746-72302-0017 AND AS HE WALKED THE TOP BOBBED ABOUT LIKE THE LID OF A BOILING SAUCEPAN WHEN THE WHORTLEBERRIES WERE RIPE IN JUNE MISSUS LAMBOLE SENT JOE OUT WITH OTHER CHILDREN TO COLLECT THE BERRIES IN A TIN CAN SHE SOLD THEM FOR FOURPENCE A QUART
6746-72302-0018 AND ANY CHILD COULD EARN EIGHTPENCE A DAY IN WHORTLEBERRY TIME ONE THAT WAS ACTIVE MIGHT EARN A SHILLING BUT JOE WOULD NOT REMAIN WITH THE OTHER CHILDREN THEY TEASED HIM
6746-72302-0019 SOUNDS IN IMITATION OF THE VOICES OF THESE BIRDS MOREOVER THEY STOLE THE BERRIES HE HAD PICKED AND PUT THEM INTO THEIR OWN CANS WHEN JOE GANDER LEFT THEM AND FOUND HIMSELF ALONE IN THE WOODS THEN HE LAY DOWN AMONG THE BROWN HEATHER AND GREEN FERN
6746-72302-0020 AND LOOKED UP THROUGH THE OAK LEAVES AT THE SKY AND LISTENED TO THE SINGING OF THE BIRDS OH WONDROUS MUSIC OF THE WOODS THE HUM OF THE SUMMER AIR AMONG THE LEAVES THE DRONE OF THE BEES ABOUT THE FLOWERS
6746-72302-0021 THE TWITTERING AND FLUTING AND PIPING OF THE FINCHES AND BLACKBIRDS AND THRUSHES AND THE COOL SOFT COOING OF THE WOOD PIGEONS LIKE THE LOWING OF AERIAL OXEN THEN THE TAPPING OF THE GREEN WOODPECKER
6746-72302-0022 AND A GLIMPSE OF ITS CRIMSON HEAD LIKE A CARBUNCLE RUNNING UP THE TREE TRUNK AND THE POWDERING DOWN OF OLD HUSKS OF FIR CONES OR OF THE TENDER RIND OF THE TOPMOST SHOOT OF A SCOTTISH PINE
6746-72302-0023 FOR ALOFT A RED SQUIRREL WAS BARKING A BEAUTIFUL TREE OUT OF WANTONNESS AND FROLIC A RABBIT WOULD COME FORTH FROM THE BRACKEN AND SIT UP IN THE SUN AND CLEAN ITS FACE WITH THE FORE PAWS
6746-72302-0024 AND STROKE ITS LONG EARS THEN SEEING THE SOILED RED COAT WOULD SKIP UP LITTLE JOE LYING VERY STILL AND SCREW ITS NOSE AND TURN ITS EYES FROM SIDE TO SIDE
6746-72302-0025 AND THEN THE BOY LAUGHED AND THE RABBIT WAS GONE WITH A FLASH OF WHITE TAIL HAPPY DAYS DAYS OF LISTENING TO MYSTERIOUS MUSIC
6746-72302-0026 OF LOOKING INTO MYSTERIES OF SUN AND FOLIAGE OF SPIRITUAL INTERCOURSE WITH THE GREAT MOTHER SOUL OF NATURE
6746-72302-0027 OH STEPPY IT WAS SO NICE EVERYTHING WAS SINGING I'LL MAKE YOU SING IN THE CHORUS TOO CRIED MISSUS LAMBOLE AND LAID A STICK ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS
6746-72302-0028 EXPERIENCE HAD TAUGHT HER THE FUTILITY OF DUSTING AT A LOWER LEVEL
6746-72302-0029 BUT WHEN HE WENT AGAIN INTO THE WOOD IT WAS AGAIN THE SAME THE SPELL OF THE WOOD SPIRITS WAS ON HIM HE FORGOT ABOUT THE BERRIES AT FOURPENCE A QUART AND LAY ON HIS BACK AND LISTENED
6746-72302-0030 AND THE WHOLE WOOD WHISPERED AND SANG TO HIM AND CONSOLED HIM FOR HIS BEATING AND THE WIND PLAYED LULLABIES AMONG THE FIR SPINES AND WHISTLED IN THE GRASS
6746-72302-0031 AND THE ASPEN CLASHED ITS MYRIAD TINY CYMBALS TOGETHER PRODUCING AN ORCHESTRA OF SOUND THAT FILLED THE SOUL OF THE DREAMING BOY WITH LOVE AND DELIGHT
6746-72302-0032 IT FARED NO BETTER IN AUTUMN WHEN THE BLACKBERRY SEASON SET IN JOE WENT WITH HIS CAN TO AN OLD QUARRY WHERE THE BRAMBLES SENT THEIR RUNNERS OVER THE MASSES OF RUBBLE THROWN OUT FROM THE PITS
6746-72302-0033 AND WARMED AND RIPENED THEIR FRUIT ON THE HOT STONES IT WAS A MARVEL TO SEE HOW THE BLACKBERRIES GREW IN THIS DESERTED QUARRY HOW LARGE THE FRUIT SWELLED HOW THICK THEY WERE LIKE MULBERRIES ON THE ROAD SIDE OF THE QUARRY WAS A BELT OF PINES
6746-72302-0034 AND THE SUN DREW OUT OF THEIR BARK SCENTS OF UNSURPASSED SWEETNESS ABOUT THE BLACKBERRIES HOVERED SPOTTED WHITE AND YELLOW AND BLACK MOTHS BEAUTIFUL AS BUTTERFLIES BUTTERFLIES DID NOT FAIL EITHER
6746-72302-0035 ASLEEP IN THE SUN WITH WINGS EXPANDED OR DRIFTING ABOUT THE CLUMPS OF YELLOW RAGWORT DOUBTFUL WHETHER TO PERCH OR NOT HERE HIDDEN BEHIND THE TREES AMONG THE LEAVES OF OVERGROWN RUBBLE
6746-72302-0036 WAS A ONE STORY COTTAGE OF WOOD AND CLAY COVERED WITH THATCH IN WHICH LIVED ROGER GALE THE POSTMAN ROGER GALE HAD TEN MILES TO WALK EVERY MORNING DELIVERING LETTERS AND THE SAME NUMBER OF MILES EVERY EVENING
6746-72302-0037 FOR WHICH TWENTY MILES HE RECEIVED THE LIBERAL PAY OF SIX SHILLINGS A WEEK HE HAD TO BE AT THE POST OFFICE AT HALF PAST SIX IN THE MORNING TO RECEIVE THE LETTERS AND AT SEVEN IN THE EVENING TO DELIVER THEM HIS WORK TOOK HIM ABOUT SIX HOURS
6746-72302-0038 THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY HE HAD TO HIMSELF ROGER GALE WAS AN OLD SOLDIER AND ENJOYED A PENSION HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF WHEN AT HOME AS A SHOEMAKER BUT THE WALKS TOOK SO MUCH OUT OF HIM BEING AN OLD MAN
6746-72302-0039 THAT HE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH AND ENERGY TO DO MUCH COBBLING WHEN AT HOME THEREFORE HE IDLED A GOOD DEAL AND HE AMUSED HIS IDLE HOURS WITH A VIOLIN NOW WHEN JOE GANDER CAME TO THE QUARRY BEFORE THE RETURN OF THE POSTMAN FROM HIS ROUNDS
6746-72302-0040 HE PICKED BLACKBERRIES BUT NO SOONER HAD ROGER GALE UNLOCKED HIS DOOR TAKEN DOWN HIS FIDDLE AND DRAWN THE BOW ACROSS THE STRINGS THAN JOE SET DOWN THE CAN AND LISTENED AND WHEN OLD ROGER BEGAN TO PLAY AN AIR FROM THE DAUGHTER OF THE REGIMENT
6746-72302-0041 THEN JOE CREPT TOWARDS HIS COTTAGE IN LITTLE STAGES OF WONDERMENT AND HUNGER TO HEAR MORE AND HEAR BETTER MUCH IN THE SAME WAY AS NOW AND AGAIN IN THE WOOD THE INQUISITIVE RABBITS HAD APPROACHED HIS RED JACKET
6746-72302-0042 PRESENTLY JOE WAS SEATED ON THE DOORSTEP WITH HIS EAR AGAINST THE WOODEN DOOR AND THE BLACKBERRIES AND THE CAN AND STEPMOTHER'S ORDERS AND FATHER'S STICK AND HIS HARD BED AND HIS MEAGRE MEALS EVEN THE WHOLE WORLD
6746-72302-0043 HAD PASSED AWAY AS A SCROLL THAT IS ROLLED UP AND LAID ASIDE AND HE LIVED ONLY IN THE WORLD OF MUSIC THOUGH HIS GREAT EYES WERE WIDE HE SAW NOTHING THROUGH THEM
6746-72302-0044 HE FELT NOTHING HE HAD BUT ONE FACULTY THAT WAS AWAKE AND THAT WAS HEARING ONE DAY ROGER CAME TO HIS DOOR AND OPENED IT SUDDENLY SO THAT THE CHILD LEANING AGAINST IT FELL ACROSS HIS THRESHOLD
6746-72302-0045 WHOM HAVE WE HERE WHAT IS THIS WHAT DO YOU WANT ASKED THE POSTMAN THEN GANDER JOE STOOD UP CRANING HIS LONG NECK AND STARING OUT OF HIS GOGGLE EYES WITH HIS ROUGH FLAXEN HAIR STANDING UP IN A RUFFLE ABOVE HIS HEAD
6746-72302-0046 AND HIS GREAT STOMACH PROTRUDED AND SAID NOTHING SO ROGER BURST OUT LAUGHING
6746-72302-0047 THIS WAS FLATTERING TO THE POSTMAN AND IT WAS THE INITIATION OF A FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THEM BUT WHEN JOE CAME HOME WITH AN EMPTY CAN AND SAID OH STEPPY MASTER ROGER GALE DID FIDDLE SO BEAUTIFUL THE WOMAN SAID FIDDLE
6746-72302-0048 I'LL FIDDLE YOUR BACK PRETTY SMARTLY YOU IDLE VAGABOND AND SHE WAS A TRUTHFUL WOMAN WHO NEVER FELL SHORT OF HER WORD TO BREAK HIM OF HIS BAD HABITS THAT IS OF HIS DREAMINESS AND USELESSNESS MISSUS LAMBOLE TOOK JOE
6746-72302-0049 TO SCHOOL AT SCHOOL HE HAD A BAD TIME OF IT HE COULD NOT LEARN THE LETTERS HE WAS MENTALLY INCAPABLE OF DOING A SUBTRACTION SUM HE SAT ON A BENCH STARING AT THE TEACHER
6746-72302-0050 AND WAS UNABLE TO ANSWER AN ORDINARY QUESTION WHAT THE LESSON WAS ABOUT THE SCHOOL CHILDREN TORMENTED HIM THE MONITOR SCOLDED AND THE MASTER BEAT THEN LITTLE JOE GANDER TOOK TO ABSENTING HIMSELF FROM SCHOOL
6746-72302-0051 BUT INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE SCHOOL HE WENT TO THE COTTAGE IN THE QUARRY AND LISTENED TO THE FIDDLE OF ROGER GALE LITTLE JOE GOT HOLD OF AN OLD BOX AND WITH A KNIFE HE CUT HOLES IN IT AND HE FASHIONED A BRIDGE
6746-72302-0052 AND THEN A HANDLE AND HE STRUNG HORSEHAIR OVER THE LATTER AND MADE A BOW AND DREW VERY FAINT SOUNDS FROM THIS IMPROVISED VIOLIN THAT MADE THE POSTMAN LAUGH BUT WHICH GAVE GREAT PLEASURE TO JOE
6746-72302-0053 THE SOUND THAT ISSUED FROM HIS INSTRUMENT WAS LIKE THE HUMMING OF FLIES BUT HE GOT DISTINCT NOTES OUT OF HIS STRINGS THOUGH THE NOTES WERE FAINT AFTER HE HAD PLAYED TRUANT FOR SOME TIME HIS FATHER HEARD WHAT HE HAD DONE
6746-72302-0054 AND HE BEAT THE BOY TILL HE WAS LIKE A BATTERED APPLE THAT HAD BEEN FLUNG FROM THE TREE BY A STORM UPON A ROAD FOR A WHILE JOE DID NOT VENTURE TO THE QUARRY EXCEPT ON SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS HE WAS FORBIDDEN BY HIS FATHER TO GO TO CHURCH
6746-72302-0055 BECAUSE THE ORGAN AND THE SINGING THERE DROVE HIM HALF CRAZED WHEN A BEAUTIFUL TOUCHING MELODY WAS PLAYED HIS EYES BECAME CLOUDED AND THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS AND WHEN THE ORGAN PLAYED THE HALLELUJAH CHORUS OR SOME GRAND AND STIRRING MARCH
6746-72302-0056 HIS EYES FLASHED AND HIS LITTLE BODY QUIVERED AND HE MADE SUCH FACES THAT THE CONGREGATION WERE DISTURBED AND THE PARSON REMONSTRATED WITH HIS MOTHER THE CHILD WAS CLEARLY IMBECILE AND UNFIT TO ATTEND DIVINE WORSHIP
6746-72302-0057 MISTER LAMBOLE GOT AN IDEA INTO HIS HEAD HE WOULD BRING UP JOE TO BE A BUTCHER AND HE INFORMED JOE THAT HE WAS GOING TO PLACE HIM WITH A GENTLEMAN OF THAT PROFESSION IN TOWN JOE CRIED HE TURNED SICK AT THE SIGHT OF BLOOD
6746-72302-0058 AND THE SMELL OF RAW MEAT WAS ABHORRENT TO HIM BUT JOE'S LIKINGS WERE OF NO ACCOUNT WITH HIS FATHER AND HE TOOK HIM TO THE TOWN AND PLACED HIM WITH A BUTCHER THERE HE WAS INVESTED IN A BLUE SMOCK AND WAS INFORMED THAT HIS DUTIES WOULD CONSIST IN TAKING MEAT ABOUT TO THE CUSTOMERS
6746-72302-0059 AND HE CRIED HIMSELF TO SLEEP THE FIRST NIGHT AND HE CRIED ALL THE NEXT DAY WHEN SENT AROUND WITH MEAT ON HIS SHOULDER NOW ON HIS JOURNEY THROUGH THE STREETS HE HAD TO PASS THE WINDOW OF A TOY SHOP IN THE WINDOW WERE DOLLS AND HORSES AND LITTLE CARTS
6746-72302-0060 FOR THESE JOE DID NOT CARE BUT THERE WERE ALSO SOME LITTLE VIOLINS SOME HIGH PRICED AND SOME VERY LOW AND OVER THESE JOE LINGERED WITH LOVING COVETOUS EYES THERE WAS ONE LITTLE FIDDLE TO WHICH HIS HEART WENT OUT
6746-72302-0061 THAT COST ONLY THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE EACH DAY AS HE PASSED THE SHOP HE WAS DRAWN TO IT AND STOOD LOOKING IN AND LONGED DAILY MORE ARDENTLY THAN ON THE PREVIOUS DAY FOR THIS THREE AND SIXPENNY VIOLIN
6746-72302-0062 THAT HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS OF SOME BOYS STEALING THE MEAT OUT OF THE SORT OF TROUGH ON HIS SHOULDER IN WHICH HE CARRIED IT ABOUT THIS WAS THE CLIMAX OF HIS MISDEEDS HE HAD BEEN REPRIMANDED FOR HIS BLUNDERS
6746-72302-0063 DELIVERING THE WRONG MEAT AT THE CUSTOMERS DOORS FOR HIS DILATORY WAYS IN GOING ON HIS ERRANDS THE BUTCHER COULD ENDURE HIM NO MORE AND SENT HIM HOME TO HIS FATHER WHO THRASHED HIM AS HIS WELCOME
6746-72302-0064 BUT HE CARRIED HOME WITH HIM THE HAUNTING RECOLLECTIONS OF THAT BEAUTIFUL LITTLE RED FIDDLE WITH ITS FINE BLACK KEYS THE BOW HE REMEMBERED WAS STRUNG WITH WHITE HORSEHAIR JOE
6746-72302-0065 HAD NOW A FIXED AMBITION SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR HE WOULD BE PERFECTLY HAPPY IF HE COULD HAVE THAT THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENNY FIDDLE BUT HOW WERE THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE TO BE EARNED
6746-72302-0066 HE CONFIDED HIS DIFFICULTY TO POSTMAN ROGER GALE AND ROGER GALE SAID HE WOULD CONSIDER THE MATTER A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER THE POSTMAN SAID TO JOE GANDER THEY WANT A LAD TO SWEEP THE LEAVES IN THE DRIVE AT THE GREAT HOUSE
6746-72302-0067 THE SQUIRE'S COACHMAN TOLD ME AND I MENTIONED YOU
6746-72302-0068 JOE'S FACE BRIGHTENED HE WENT HOME AND TOLD HIS STEPMOTHER
6746-72302-0069 SAID MISSUS LAMBOLE VERY WELL YOU SHALL SWEEP THE DRIVE THEN FIVEPENCE WILL COME TO US AND YOU SHALL HAVE A PENNY EVERY WEEK TO SPEND IN SWEETSTUFF AT THE POST OFFICE JOE TRIED TO RECKON HOW LONG IT WOULD BE BEFORE HE COULD PURCHASE THE FIDDLE
6746-72302-0070 BUT THE CALCULATION WAS BEYOND HIS POWERS SO HE ASKED THE POSTMAN WHO ASSURED HIM IT WOULD TAKE HIM FORTY WEEKS THAT IS ABOUT TEN MONTHS LITTLE JOE WAS NOT CAST DOWN WHAT WAS TIME WITH SUCH AN END IN VIEW
6746-72302-0071 JACOB SERVED FOURTEEN YEARS FOR RACHEL AND THIS WAS ONLY FORTY WEEKS FOR A FIDDLE JOE WAS DILIGENT EVERY SATURDAY SWEEPING THE DRIVE HE WAS ORDERED WHENEVER A CARRIAGE ENTERED TO DIVE BEHIND THE RHODODENDRONS AND LAURELS AND DISAPPEAR
6746-72302-0072 HE WAS OF A TOO RAGGED AND IDIOTIC APPEARANCE TO SHOW IN A GENTLEMAN'S GROUNDS ONCE OR TWICE HE ENCOUNTERED THE SQUIRE AND STOOD QUAKING WITH HIS FINGERS SPREAD OUT HIS MOUTH AND EYES OPEN AND THE BROOM AT HIS FEET
6746-72302-0073 POOR FELLOW SAID THE SQUIRE TO THE GARDENER I SUPPOSE IT IS A CHARITY TO EMPLOY HIM BUT I MUST SAY I SHOULD HAVE PREFERRED SOMEONE ELSE WITH HIS WITS ABOUT HIM I WILL SEE TO HAVING HIM SENT TO AN ASYLUM FOR IDIOTS
6746-72302-0074 IN WHICH I HAVE SOME INTEREST THERE'S NO KNOWING SAID THE SQUIRE NO KNOWING BUT THAT WITH WHOLESOME FOOD CLEANLINESS AND KINDNESS HIS FEEBLE MIND MAY BE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT TWO AND TWO MAKE FOUR WHICH I LEARN HE HAS NOT YET MASTERED
6746-72302-0075 EVERY SATURDAY EVENING JOE GANDER BROUGHT HIS SIXPENCE HOME TO HIS STEPMOTHER THE WOMAN WAS NOT SO REGULAR IN ALLOWING HIM HIS PENNY OUT
6746-72302-0076 STEPPY NEED I GO TO SCHOOL ANY MORE
6746-72302-0077 THEN SAID MISSUS LAMBOLE
6746-72302-0078 VERY WELL EATING SUCH A LOT DOES NO ONE GOOD IF YOU WILL BE CONTENT WITH ONE SLICE OF BREAD FOR BREAKFAST INSTEAD OF TWO AND THE SAME FOR SUPPER YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR PENNY
6746-72302-0079 A SWEDE OR A MANGOLD OUT OF FARMER EGGINS'S FIELD SWEDES AND MANGOLDS ARE COOLING TO THE BLOOD AND SIT LIGHT ON THE STOMICK SAID MISSUS LAMBOLE SO THE COMPACT WAS MADE BUT IT NEARLY KILLED JOE
6746-72302-0080 HIS CHEEKS AND CHEST FELL IN DEEPER AND DEEPER AND HIS STOMACH PROTRUDED MORE THAN EVER HIS LEGS SEEMED HARDLY ABLE TO SUPPORT HIM AND HIS GREAT PALE BLUE WANDERING EYES APPEARED READY TO START OUT OF HIS HEAD LIKE THE HORNS OF A SNAIL
6746-72302-0081 AS FOR HIS VOICE IT WAS THIN AND TONELESS LIKE THE NOTES ON HIS IMPROVISED FIDDLE ON WHICH HE PLAYED INCESSANTLY THE CHILD WILL ALWAYS BE A DISCREDIT TO US SAID LAMBOLE
6746-72302-0082 HE DON'T LOOK LIKE A HUMAN CHILD HE DON'T THINK AND FEEL LIKE A CHRISTIAN THE SHOVELFULS OF DUNG HE MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT TO COVER OUR GARDEN IF HE HAD ONLY GIVEN HIS HEART TO IT I'VE HEARD OF CHANGELINGS SAID MISSUS LAMBOLE
6746-72302-0083 THEY DO SAY THAT THE PIXIES STEAL AWAY THE BABIES OF CHRISTIAN FOLK AND PUT THEIR OWN BANTLINGS IN THEIR STEAD THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT IS TO HEAT A POKER RED HOT AND RAM IT DOWN THE THROAT OF THE CHILD
6746-72302-0084 AND RUNS OFF WITH HER OWN CHILD AND LEAVES YOUR PROPER BABE BEHIND
6746-72302-0085 SAID LAMBOLE THRUSTING HOT COALS BACK ON TO THE HEARTH WITH HIS FOOT I DON'T SUPPOSE IT WOULD SAID MISSUS LAMBOLE AND YET WE CALL THIS A LAND OF LIBERTY LAW AIN'T MADE FOR THE POOR BUT FOR THE RICH
6746-72302-0086 IT IS WICKEDNESS ARGUED THE FATHER IT IS JUST THE SAME WITH COLTS ALL WICKEDNESS YOU MUST DRIVE IT OUT WITH THE STICK AND NOW A GREAT TEMPTATION FELL ON LITTLE GANDER JOE
6746-72302-0087 AND THE DAUGHTER OF THE HOUSE MISS AMORY WAS MUSICAL HER MOTHER PLAYED ON THE PIANO AND THE YOUNG LADY ON THE VIOLIN
6746-72302-0088 AND MISS AMORY HAD TAKEN LESSONS FROM THE BEST MASTERS IN TOWN SHE PLAYED VASTLY BETTER THAN POOR ROGER GALE AND SHE PLAYED TO AN ACCOMPANIMENT SOMETIMES WHILST JOE WAS SWEEPING HE HEARD THE MUSIC
6746-72302-0089 THEN HE STOLE NEARER AND NEARER TO THE HOUSE HIDING BEHIND RHODODENDRON BUSHES AND LISTENING WITH EYES AND MOUTH AND NOSTRILS AND EARS THE MUSIC EXERCISED ON HIM AN IRRESISTIBLE ATTRACTION
6746-72302-0090 HE FORGOT HIS OBLIGATION TO WORK HE FORGOT THE STRICT ORDERS HE HAD RECEIVED NOT TO APPROACH THE GARDEN FRONT OF THE HOUSE THE MUSIC ACTED ON HIM LIKE A SPELL OCCASIONALLY HE WAS ROUSED FROM HIS DREAM BY THE GARDENER WHO BOXED HIS EARS
6746-72302-0091 ONCE A SERVANT CAME OUT FROM MISS AMORY TO TELL THE RAGGED LITTLE BOY NOT TO STAND IN FRONT OF THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOW STARING IN ON ANOTHER OCCASION HE WAS FOUND BY MISS AMORY
6746-72302-0092 THEY THOUGHT HIM A FOOL AND THAT HE HAD THE INQUISITIVENESS OF THE HALF WITTED TO PEER IN AT WINDOWS AND SEE THE PRETTY SIGHTS WITHIN HE WAS REPRIMANDED AND THREATENED WITH DISMISSAL
6746-72302-0093 AND YOU MUST TEACH THEM AS YOU FEED THE POLAR BEARS WITH THE END OF A STICK ONE DAY MISS AMORY SEEING HOW THIN AND HOLLOW EYED THE CHILD WAS AND HEARING HIM COUGH BROUGHT HIM OUT A CUP OF HOT COFFEE AND SOME BREAD
6746-72302-0094 HE TOOK IT WITHOUT A WORD ONLY PULLING OFF HIS TORN STRAW HAT AND THROWING IT AT HIS FEET EXPOSING THE FULL SHOCK OF TOW LIKE HAIR THEN HE STARED AT HER OUT OF HIS GREAT EYES SPEECHLESS JOE SHE SAID
6746-72302-0095 POOR LITTLE MAN HOW OLD ARE YOU DUN'NOW HE ANSWERED CAN YOU READ AND WRITE NO NOR DO SUMS NO WHAT CAN YOU DO FIDDLE
6746-72302-0096 HAVE YOU GOT A FIDDLE YES I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE IT AND HEAR YOU PLAY NEXT DAY WAS SUNDAY LITTLE JOE FORGOT ABOUT THE DAY AND FORGOT THAT MISS AMORY WOULD PROBABLY BE IN CHURCH IN THE MORNING
6746-72302-0097 SHE HAD ASKED TO SEE HIS FIDDLE SO IN THE MORNING HE TOOK IT AND WENT DOWN WITH IT TO THE PARK THE CHURCH WAS WITHIN THE GROUNDS AND HE HAD TO PASS IT AS HE WENT BY HE HEARD THE ROLL OF THE ORGAN AND THE STRAINS OF THE CHOIR
6746-72302-0098 HE STOPPED TO HEARKEN THEN WENT UP THE STEPS OF THE CHURCHYARD LISTENING A DESIRE CAME ON HIM TO CATCH THE AIR ON HIS IMPROVISED VIOLIN AND HE PUT IT TO HIS SHOULDER
6746-72302-0099 AND DREW HIS BOW ACROSS THE SLENDER CORDS THE SOUND WAS VERY FAINT SO FAINT AS TO BE DROWNED BY THE GREATER VOLUME OF THE ORGAN AND THE CHOIR NEVERTHELESS HE COULD HEAR THE FEEBLE TONES CLOSE TO HIS EAR
6746-72302-0100 AND HIS HEART DANCED AT THE PLEASURE OF PLAYING TO AN ACCOMPANIMENT LIKE MISS AMORY THE CHOIR THE CONGREGATION WERE SINGING THE ADVENT HYMN TO LUTHER'S TUNE GREAT GOD
6746-72302-0101 WHAT DO I SEE AND HEAR THE END OF THINGS CREATED LITTLE JOE PLAYING HIS INAUDIBLE INSTRUMENT CAME CREEPING UP THE AVENUE TREADING ON THE FALLEN YELLOW LIME LEAVES
6746-72302-0102 PASSING BETWEEN THE TOMBSTONES DRAWN ON BY THE SOLEMN BEAUTIFUL MUSIC PRESENTLY HE STOOD IN THE PORCH THEN HE WENT ON HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS OF EVERYTHING BUT THE MUSIC
6746-72302-0103 AND THE JOY OF PLAYING WITH IT HE WALKED ON SOFTLY INTO THE CHURCH WITHOUT EVEN REMOVING HIS RAGGED STRAW CAP THOUGH THE SQUIRE AND THE SQUIRE'S WIFE AND THE RECTOR AND THE REVEREND THE MISSUS RECTOR AND THE PARISH CHURCHWARDEN
6746-72302-0104 AND THE RECTOR'S CHURCHWARDEN AND THE OVERSEER AND THE WAYWARDEN AND ALL THE FARMERS AND THEIR WIVES WERE PRESENT HE HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIS BROKEN CAP IN THE DELIGHT THAT MADE THE TEARS FILL HIS EYES AND TRICKLE OVER HIS PALE CHEEKS
6746-72302-0105 COMING UP THE NAVE FIDDLING WITH HIS HAT ON REGARDLESS OF THE SACREDNESS OF THE PLACE
6746-72302-0106 J P AND D L THE RECTOR COUGHED VERY LOUD AND LOOKED HARD AT HIS CHURCHWARDEN FARMER EGGINS WHO TURNED RED AS THE SUN IN A NOVEMBER FOG AND ROSE AT THE SAME INSTANT THE PEOPLE'S CHURCHWARDEN ROSE
6746-72302-0107 AND BOTH ADVANCED UPON JOE GANDER FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE CHURCH AT THE MOMENT THAT THEY TOUCHED HIM THE ORGAN AND THE SINGING CEASED AND IT WAS TO JOE A SUDDEN WAKENING FROM A GOLDEN DREAM TO A BLACK
6746-72302-0108 HE LOOKED UP WITH DAZED FACE FIRST AT ONE MAN THEN AT THE OTHER BOTH THEIR FACES BLAZED WITH EQUAL INDIGNATION BOTH WERE EQUALLY SPEECHLESS WITH WRATH THEY CONDUCTED HIM EACH HOLDING AN ARM OUT OF THE PORCH
6746-72302-0109 AND DOWN THE AVENUE JOE HEARD INDISTINCTLY BEHIND HIM THE DRONING OF THE RECTOR'S VOICE CONTINUING THE PRAYERS HE LOOKED BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER AND SAW THE FACES OF THE SCHOOL CHILDREN STRAINING AFTER HIM THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR FROM THEIR PLACES NEAR IT
6746-72302-0110 THE PEOPLE'S CHURCHWARDEN UTTERED A LOUD AND DISGUSTED UGH THEN WITH HIS HEAVY HAND SLAPPED THE HEAD OF THE CHILD TOWARDS THE PARSON'S CHURCHWARDEN WHO WITH HIS STILL HEAVIER HAND BOXED IT BACK AGAIN THEN THE PEOPLE'S CHURCHWARDEN GAVE HIM A BLOW
6746-72302-0111 WHICH SENT HIM STAGGERING FORWARD AND THIS WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY A KICK FROM THE PARSON'S CHURCHWARDEN WHICH SENT JOE GANDER SPINNING DOWN THE FIVE STEPS AT ONCE AND CAST HIM PROSTRATE INTO THE ROAD WHERE HE FELL AND CRUSHED HIS EXTEMPORISED VIOLIN
6746-72302-0112 THEN THE CHURCHWARDENS TURNED BLEW THEIR NOSES AND RE ENTERED THE CHURCH WHERE THEY SAT OUT THE REST OF THE SERVICE GRATEFUL IN THEIR HEARTS THAT THEY HAD BEEN ENABLED THAT DAY TO SHOW THAT THEIR OFFICE WAS NO SINECURE
6746-72302-0113 THE CHURCHWARDENS WERE UNAWARE THAT IN BANGING AND KICKING THE LITTLE BOY OUT OF THE CHURCHYARD AND INTO THE ROAD THEY HAD FLUNG HIM SO THAT HE FELL WITH HIS HEAD UPON THE CURBSTONE OF THE FOOTPATH WHICH STONE WAS OF SLATE
6746-72302-0114 AND SHARP THEY DID NOT FIND THIS OUT THROUGH THE PRAYERS NOR THROUGH THE SERMON BUT WHEN THE WHOLE CONGREGATION LEFT THE CHURCH THEY WERE STARTLED TO FIND LITTLE JOE GANDER INSENSIBLE WITH HIS HEAD CUT
6746-72302-0115 AND A POOL OF BLOOD ON THE FOOTWAY THE SQUIRE WAS SHOCKED AS WERE HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER AND THE CHURCHWARDENS WERE IN CONSTERNATION
