274-121398-0000 THEY PROCEEDED SILENTLY TO THE CENTRE OF THE PLACE BUT AS AT THIS VERY MOMENT THE MOON HAD JUST EMERGED FROM BEHIND A CLOUD THEY THOUGHT THEY MIGHT BE OBSERVED IF THEY REMAINED ON THAT SPOT AND THEREFORE REGAINED THE SHADE OF THE LIME TREES
274-121398-0001 GENTLEMEN HE SAID OUR PRESENCE HERE IS THE BEST PROOF OF FORMER FRIENDSHIP NOT ONE OF US HAS FAILED THE OTHERS AT THIS RENDEZVOUS NOT ONE HAS THEREFORE TO REPROACH HIMSELF HEAR ME COUNT REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN
