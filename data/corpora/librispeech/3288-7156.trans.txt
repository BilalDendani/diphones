3288-7156-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SIX THE STORY CLUB IS FORMED JUNIOR AVONLEA FOUND IT HARD TO SETTLE DOWN TO HUMDRUM EXISTENCE AGAIN TO ANNE IN PARTICULAR
3288-7156-0001 AT FIRST AS SHE TOLD DIANA SHE DID NOT REALLY THINK SHE COULD I'M POSITIVELY CERTAIN DIANA THAT LIFE CAN NEVER BE QUITE THE SAME AGAIN AS IT WAS IN THOSE OLDEN DAYS
3288-7156-0002 SHE SAID MOURNFULLY AS IF REFERRING TO A PERIOD OF AT LEAST FIFTY YEARS BACK PERHAPS AFTER A WHILE I'LL GET USED TO IT BUT I'M AFRAID CONCERTS SPOIL PEOPLE FOR EVERYDAY LIFE
3288-7156-0003 I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY MARILLA DISAPPROVES OF THEM MARILLA IS SUCH A SENSIBLE WOMAN IT MUST BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER TO BE SENSIBLE BUT STILL
3288-7156-0004 I DON'T BELIEVE I'D REALLY WANT TO BE A SENSIBLE PERSON BECAUSE THEY ARE SO UNROMANTIC MISSUS LYNDE SAYS THERE IS NO DANGER OF MY EVER BEING ONE BUT YOU CAN NEVER TELL I FEEL JUST NOW
3288-7156-0005 THAT I MAY GROW UP TO BE SENSIBLE YET BUT PERHAPS THAT IS ONLY BECAUSE I'M TIRED I SIMPLY COULDN'T SLEEP LAST NIGHT FOR EVER SO LONG I JUST LAY AWAKE AND IMAGINED THE CONCERT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
3288-7156-0006 THAT'S ONE SPLENDID THING ABOUT SUCH AFFAIRS IT'S SO LOVELY TO LOOK BACK TO THEM EVENTUALLY HOWEVER AVONLEA SCHOOL SLIPPED BACK INTO ITS OLD GROOVE AND TOOK UP ITS OLD INTERESTS
3288-7156-0007 TO BE SURE THE CONCERT LEFT TRACES RUBY GILLIS AND EMMA WHITE WHO HAD QUARRELED OVER A POINT OF PRECEDENCE IN THEIR PLATFORM SEATS NO LONGER SAT AT THE SAME DESK
3288-7156-0008 AND A PROMISING FRIENDSHIP OF THREE YEARS WAS BROKEN UP JOSIE PYE AND JULIA BELL DID NOT SPEAK FOR THREE MONTHS BECAUSE JOSIE PYE HAD TOLD BESSIE WRIGHT THAT JULIA BELL'S BOW WHEN SHE GOT UP TO RECITE
3288-7156-0009 MADE HER THINK OF A CHICKEN JERKING ITS HEAD AND BESSIE TOLD JULIA NONE OF THE SLOANES WOULD HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THE BELLS BECAUSE THE BELLS HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLOANES HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE PROGRAM
3288-7156-0010 AND THE SLOANES HAD RETORTED THAT THE BELLS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THE LITTLE THEY HAD TO DO PROPERLY FINALLY CHARLIE SLOANE FOUGHT MOODY SPURGEON MAC PHERSON BECAUSE MOODY SPURGEON HAD SAID THAT ANNE SHIRLEY PUT ON AIRS
3288-7156-0011 ABOUT HER RECITATIONS AND MOODY SPURGEON WAS LICKED CONSEQUENTLY MOODY SPURGEON'S SISTER
3288-7156-0012 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THESE TRIFLING FRICTIONS WORK IN MISS STACY'S LITTLE KINGDOM WENT ON WITH REGULARITY AND SMOOTHNESS THE WINTER WEEKS SLIPPED BY
3288-7156-0013 IT WAS AN UNUSUALLY MILD WINTER WITH SO LITTLE SNOW THAT ANNE AND DIANA COULD GO TO SCHOOL NEARLY EVERY DAY BY WAY OF THE BIRCH PATH ON ANNE'S BIRTHDAY
3288-7156-0014 THEY WERE TRIPPING LIGHTLY DOWN IT KEEPING EYES AND EARS ALERT AMID ALL THEIR CHATTER FOR MISS STACY HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEY MUST SOON WRITE A COMPOSITION ON A WINTER'S WALK IN THE WOODS
3288-7156-0015 AND IT BEHOOVED THEM TO BE OBSERVANT JUST THINK DIANA I'M THIRTEEN YEARS OLD TODAY REMARKED ANNE IN AN AWED VOICE I CAN SCARCELY REALIZE THAT I'M IN MY TEENS
3288-7156-0016 YOU'VE BEEN THIRTEEN FOR A MONTH SO I SUPPOSE IT DOESN'T SEEM SUCH A NOVELTY TO YOU AS IT DOES TO ME IT MAKES LIFE SEEM SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING IN TWO MORE YEARS I'LL BE REALLY GROWN UP
3288-7156-0017 IT'S A GREAT COMFORT TO THINK THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO USE BIG WORDS THEN WITHOUT BEING LAUGHED AT RUBY GILLIS SAYS SHE MEANS TO HAVE A BEAU AS SOON AS SHE'S FIFTEEN SAID DIANA
3288-7156-0018 RUBY GILLIS THINKS OF NOTHING BUT BEAUS SAID ANNE DISDAINFULLY SHE'S ACTUALLY DELIGHTED WHEN ANYONE WRITES HER NAME UP IN A TAKE NOTICE FOR ALL SHE PRETENDS TO BE SO MAD
3288-7156-0019 BUT I'M AFRAID THAT IS AN UNCHARITABLE SPEECH MISSUS ALLAN SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER MAKE UNCHARITABLE SPEECHES BUT THEY DO SLIP OUT SO OFTEN BEFORE YOU THINK DON'T THEY I SIMPLY CAN'T TALK ABOUT JOSIE PYE
3288-7156-0020 WITHOUT MAKING AN UNCHARITABLE SPEECH SO I NEVER MENTION HER AT ALL YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT I'M TRYING TO BE AS MUCH LIKE MISSUS ALLAN AS I POSSIBLY CAN FOR I THINK SHE'S PERFECT
3288-7156-0021 MISTER ALLAN THINKS SO TOO MISSUS LYNDE SAYS HE JUST WORSHIPS THE GROUND SHE TREADS ON AND SHE DOESN'T REALLY THINK IT RIGHT FOR A MINISTER TO SET HIS AFFECTIONS SO MUCH ON A MORTAL BEING BUT THEN DIANA
3288-7156-0022 EVEN MINISTERS ARE HUMAN AND HAVE THEIR BESETTING SINS JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE I HAD SUCH AN INTERESTING TALK WITH MISSUS ALLAN ABOUT BESETTING SINS LAST SUNDAY AFTERNOON THERE ARE JUST A FEW THINGS
3288-7156-0023 IT'S PROPER TO TALK ABOUT ON SUNDAYS AND THAT IS ONE OF THEM MY BESETTING SIN IS IMAGINING TOO MUCH AND FORGETTING MY DUTIES I'M STRIVING VERY HARD TO OVERCOME IT AND NOW THAT I'M REALLY THIRTEEN
3288-7156-0024 PERHAPS I'LL GET ON BETTER IN FOUR MORE YEARS WE'LL BE ABLE TO PUT OUR HAIR UP SAID DIANA ALICE BELL IS ONLY SIXTEEN AND SHE IS WEARING HERS UP BUT I THINK THAT'S RIDICULOUS
3288-7156-0025 BESIDES I WAS COMPARING IT WITH MY OWN NOSE AND THAT'S VANITY I'M AFRAID I THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT MY NOSE EVER SINCE I HEARD THAT COMPLIMENT ABOUT IT LONG AGO
3288-7156-0026 IT REALLY IS A GREAT COMFORT TO ME OH DIANA LOOK THERE'S A RABBIT THAT'S SOMETHING TO REMEMBER FOR OUR WOODS COMPOSITION I REALLY THINK THE WOODS ARE JUST AS LOVELY IN WINTER AS IN SUMMER THEY'RE SO WHITE AND STILL
3288-7156-0027 AS IF THEY WERE ASLEEP AND DREAMING PRETTY DREAMS I WON'T MIND WRITING THAT COMPOSITION WHEN ITS TIME COMES SIGHED DIANA I CAN MANAGE TO WRITE ABOUT THE WOODS BUT THE ONE WE'RE TO HAND IN MONDAY IS TERRIBLE
3288-7156-0028 THE IDEA OF MISS STACY TELLING US TO WRITE A STORY OUT OF OUR OWN HEADS WHY IT'S AS EASY AS WINK SAID ANNE IT'S EASY FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN IMAGINATION RETORTED DIANA
3288-7156-0029 BUT WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU HAD BEEN BORN WITHOUT ONE I SUPPOSE
3288-7156-0030 ANNE NODDED TRYING HARD NOT TO LOOK VIRTUOUSLY COMPLACENT AND FAILING MISERABLY I WROTE IT LAST MONDAY EVENING IT'S CALLED THE JEALOUS RIVAL OR
3288-7156-0031 IN DEATH NOT DIVIDED I READ IT TO MARILLA AND SHE SAID IT WAS STUFF AND NONSENSE THEN I READ IT TO MATTHEW AND HE SAID IT WAS FINE THAT IS THE KIND OF CRITIC I LIKE
3288-7156-0032 IT'S A SAD SWEET STORY I JUST CRIED LIKE A CHILD WHILE I WAS WRITING IT
3288-7156-0033 WHO LIVED IN THE SAME VILLAGE AND WERE DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER CORDELIA WAS A REGAL BRUNETTE WITH A CORONET OF MIDNIGHT HAIR AND DUSKLY FLASHING EYES GERALDINE
3288-7156-0034 WAS A QUEENLY BLONDE WITH HAIR LIKE SPUN GOLD AND VELVETY PURPLE EYES
3288-7156-0035 SAID DIANA DUBIOUSLY NEITHER DID I I JUST IMAGINED THEM I WANTED SOMETHING OUT OF THE COMMON GERALDINE HAD AN ALABASTER BROW TOO I'VE FOUND OUT WHAT AN ALABASTER BROW IS
3288-7156-0036 THAT IS ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF BEING THIRTEEN YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE ONLY TWELVE WELL WHAT BECAME OF CORDELIA AND GERALDINE ASKED DIANA
3288-7156-0037 WHO WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL RATHER INTERESTED IN THEIR FATE
3288-7156-0038 THEN BERTRAM DE VERE CAME TO THEIR NATIVE VILLAGE AND FELL IN LOVE WITH THE FAIR GERALDINE HE SAVED HER LIFE WHEN HER HORSE RAN AWAY WITH HER IN A CARRIAGE AND SHE FAINTED IN HIS ARMS AND HE CARRIED HER HOME THREE MILES
3288-7156-0039 BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND THE CARRIAGE WAS ALL SMASHED UP I FOUND IT RATHER HARD TO IMAGINE THE PROPOSAL BECAUSE I HAD NO EXPERIENCE TO GO BY I ASKED RUBY GILLIS IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MEN PROPOSED
3288-7156-0040 BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKELY BE AN AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT HAVING SO MANY SISTERS MARRIED RUBY TOLD ME SHE WAS HID IN THE HALL PANTRY WHEN MALCOLM ANDRES PROPOSED TO HER SISTER SUSAN SHE SAID MALCOLM TOLD SUSAN THAT HIS DAD
3288-7156-0041 HAD GIVEN HIM THE FARM IN HIS OWN NAME AND THEN SAID WHAT DO YOU SAY DARLING PET IF WE GET HITCHED THIS FALL AND SUSAN SAID YES NO I DON'T KNOW LET ME S E E AND THERE THEY WERE ENGAGED AS QUICK AS THAT
3288-7156-0042 BUT I DIDN'T THINK THAT SORT OF A PROPOSAL WAS A VERY ROMANTIC ONE SO IN THE END I HAD TO IMAGINE IT OUT AS WELL AS I COULD
3288-7156-0043 I MADE IT VERY FLOWERY AND POETICAL AND BERTRAM WENT ON HIS KNEES ALTHOUGH RUBY GILLIS SAYS IT ISN'T DONE NOWADAYS GERALDINE ACCEPTED HIM IN A SPEECH A PAGE LONG
3288-7156-0044 I CAN TELL YOU I TOOK A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH THAT SPEECH I REWROTE IT FIVE TIMES AND I LOOK UPON IT AS MY MASTERPIECE BERTRAM GAVE HER A DIAMOND RING AND A RUBY NECKLACE
3288-7156-0045 AND TOLD HER THEY WOULD GO TO EUROPE FOR A WEDDING TOUR FOR HE WAS IMMENSELY WEALTHY BUT THEN ALAS SHADOWS BEGAN TO DARKEN OVER THEIR PATH
3288-7156-0046 CORDELIA WAS SECRETLY IN LOVE WITH BERTRAM HERSELF AND WHEN GERALDINE TOLD HER ABOUT THE ENGAGEMENT SHE WAS SIMPLY FURIOUS ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE SAW THE NECKLACE AND THE DIAMOND RING ALL HER AFFECTION FOR GERALDINE
3288-7156-0047 TURNED TO BITTER HATE AND SHE VOWED THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER MARRY BERTRAM BUT SHE PRETENDED TO BE GERALDINE'S FRIEND THE SAME AS EVER ONE EVENING THEY WERE STANDING ON THE BRIDGE OVER A RUSHING TURBULENT STREAM AND CORDELIA
3288-7156-0048 THINKING THEY WERE ALONE PUSHED GERALDINE OVER THE BRINK WITH A WILD MOCKING HA HA HA BUT BERTRAM SAW IT ALL AND HE AT ONCE PLUNGED INTO THE CURRENT EXCLAIMING I WILL SAVE THEE MY PEERLESS GERALDINE BUT ALAS
3288-7156-0049 HE HAD FORGOTTEN HE COULDN'T SWIM AND THEY WERE BOTH DROWNED CLASPED IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS THEIR BODIES WERE WASHED ASHORE SOON AFTERWARDS THEY WERE BURIED IN THE ONE GRAVE
3288-7156-0050 AND THEIR FUNERAL WAS MOST IMPOSING DIANA IT'S SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC TO END A STORY UP WITH A FUNERAL THAN A WEDDING AS FOR CORDELIA SHE WENT INSANE WITH REMORSE AND WAS SHUT UP IN A LUNATIC ASYLUM
3288-7156-0051 I THOUGHT THAT WAS A POETICAL RETRIBUTION FOR HER CRIME HOW PERFECTLY LOVELY SIGHED DIANA WHO BELONGED TO MATTHEW'S SCHOOL OF CRITICS
3288-7156-0052 I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN MAKE UP SUCH THRILLING THINGS OUT OF YOUR OWN HEAD ANNE I WISH MY IMAGINATION WAS AS GOOD AS YOURS IT WOULD BE IF YOU'D ONLY CULTIVATE IT SAID ANNE CHEERINGLY
3288-7156-0053 I'VE JUST THOUGHT OF A PLAN DIANA LET YOU AND ME HAVE A STORY CLUB ALL OUR OWN AND WRITE STORIES FOR PRACTICE I'LL HELP YOU ALONG UNTIL YOU CAN DO THEM BY YOURSELF YOU OUGHT TO CULTIVATE YOUR IMAGINATION YOU KNOW
3288-7156-0054 MISS STACY SAYS SO ONLY WE MUST TAKE THE RIGHT WAY I TOLD HER ABOUT THE HAUNTED WOOD BUT SHE SAID WE WENT THE WRONG WAY ABOUT IT IN THAT THIS WAS HOW THE STORY CLUB CAME INTO EXISTENCE
3288-7156-0055 IT WAS LIMITED TO DIANA AND ANNE AT FIRST BUT SOON IT WAS EXTENDED TO INCLUDE JANE ANDREWS AND RUBY GILLIS AND ONE OR TWO OTHERS WHO FELT THAT THEIR IMAGINATIONS NEEDED CULTIVATING NO BOYS WERE ALLOWED IN IT
3288-7156-0056 ALTHOUGH RUBY GILLIS OPINED THAT THEIR ADMISSION WOULD MAKE IT MORE EXCITING AND EACH MEMBER HAD TO PRODUCE ONE STORY A WEEK IT'S EXTREMELY INTERESTING ANNE TOLD MARILLA
3288-7156-0057 AND THEN WE TALK IT OVER WE ARE GOING TO KEEP THEM ALL SACREDLY
3288-7156-0058 THEN DIANA PUTS TOO MANY MURDERS INTO HERS SHE SAYS MOST OF THE TIME SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE PEOPLE SO SHE KILLS THEM OFF TO GET RID OF THEM I MOSTLY ALWAYS HAVE TO TELL THEM WHAT TO WRITE ABOUT BUT THAT ISN'T HARD
3288-7156-0059 FOR I'VE MILLIONS OF IDEAS I THINK THIS STORY WRITING BUSINESS IS THE FOOLISHEST YET SCOFFED MARILLA YOU'LL GET A PACK OF NONSENSE INTO YOUR HEADS AND WASTE TIME THAT SHOULD BE PUT ON YOUR LESSONS
3288-7156-0060 AND ALL THE BAD ONES ARE SUITABLY PUNISHED I'M SURE THAT MUST HAVE A WHOLESOME EFFECT THE MORAL IS THE GREAT THING MISTER ALLAN SAYS SO I READ ONE OF MY STORIES TO HIM
3288-7156-0061 AND MISSUS ALLAN AND THEY BOTH AGREED THAT THE MORAL WAS EXCELLENT ONLY THEY LAUGHED IN THE WRONG PLACES I LIKE IT BETTER WHEN PEOPLE CRY JANE AND RUBY ALMOST ALWAYS CRY WHEN I COME TO THE PATHETIC PARTS
3288-7156-0062 DIANA WROTE HER AUNT JOSEPHINE ABOUT OUR CLUB AND HER AUNT JOSEPHINE WROTE BACK THAT WE WERE TO SEND HER SOME OF OUR STORIES SO WE COPIED OUT FOUR OF OUR VERY BEST AND SENT THEM MISS JOSEPHINE BARRY
3288-7156-0063 WROTE BACK THAT SHE HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING SO AMUSING IN HER LIFE THAT KIND OF PUZZLED US BECAUSE THE STORIES WERE ALL VERY PATHETIC
3288-7156-0064 BUT I'M GLAD MISS BARRY LIKED THEM IT SHOWS OUR CLUB IS DOING SOME GOOD IN THE WORLD MISSUS ALLAN SAYS THAT OUGHT TO BE OUR OBJECT IN EVERYTHING
3288-7156-0065 I HOPE I SHALL BE A LITTLE LIKE MISSUS ALLAN WHEN I GROW UP DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY PROSPECT OF IT MARILLA I SHOULDN'T SAY THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL WAS MARILLA'S ENCOURAGING ANSWER I'M SURE MISSUS ALLAN
3288-7156-0066 WAS NEVER SUCH A SILLY FORGETFUL LITTLE GIRL AS YOU ARE NO
3288-7156-0067 SHE TOLD ME SO HERSELF THAT IS
3288-7156-0068 I FELT SO ENCOURAGED WHEN I HEARD THAT IS IT VERY WICKED OF ME MARILLA TO FEEL ENCOURAGED WHEN I HEAR THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BAD AND MISCHIEVOUS MISSUS LYNDE SAYS IT IS MISSUS LYNDE
3288-7156-0069 SAYS SHE ALWAYS FEELS SHOCKED WHEN SHE HEARS OF ANYONE EVER HAVING BEEN NAUGHTY NO MATTER HOW SMALL THEY WERE
3288-7156-0070 HE STOLE A STRAWBERRY TART OUT OF HIS AUNT'S PANTRY AND SHE NEVER HAD ANY RESPECT FOR THAT MINISTER AGAIN NOW I WOULDN'T HAVE FELT THAT WAY
3288-7156-0071 AND I'D HAVE THOUGHT WHAT AN ENCOURAGING THING IT WOULD BE FOR SMALL BOYS NOWADAYS WHO DO NAUGHTY THINGS AND ARE SORRY FOR THEM TO KNOW THAT PERHAPS THEY MAY GROW UP TO BE MINISTERS IN SPITE OF IT THAT'S HOW I'D FEEL MARILLA
3288-7156-0072 THE WAY I FEEL AT PRESENT ANNE SAID MARILLA
