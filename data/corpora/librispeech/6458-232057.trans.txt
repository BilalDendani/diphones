6458-232057-0000 THE CURE FOR LOVE THE EXCELLENT MISTER MORRIS WAS AN ENGLISHMAN AND HE LIVED IN THE DAYS OF QUEEN VICTORIA THE GOOD HE WAS A PROSPEROUS AND VERY SENSIBLE MAN HE READ THE TIMES AND WENT TO CHURCH AND AS HE GREW TOWARDS MIDDLE AGE AN EXPRESSION OF QUIET CONTENTED CONTEMPT
6458-232057-0001 FOR ALL WHO WERE NOT AS HIMSELF SETTLED ON HIS FACE HE WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO EVERYTHING THAT IS RIGHT AND PROPER AND SENSIBLE WITH INEVITABLE REGULARITY HE ALWAYS WORE JUST THE RIGHT AND PROPER CLOTHES STEERING THE NARROW WAY BETWEEN THE SMART AND THE SHABBY
6458-232057-0002 AND AMONG OTHER RIGHT AND PROPER POSSESSIONS THIS MISTER MORRIS HAD A WIFE AND CHILDREN THEY WERE THE RIGHT SORT OF WIFE AND THE RIGHT SORT AND NUMBER OF CHILDREN OF COURSE NOTHING IMAGINATIVE OR HIGHTY FLIGHTY ABOUT ANY OF THEM SO FAR AS MISTER MORRIS COULD SEE THEY WORE PERFECTLY CORRECT CLOTHING
6458-232057-0003 NEITHER SMART NOR HYGIENIC NOR FADDY IN ANY WAY BUT JUST SENSIBLE AND THEY LIVED IN A NICE SENSIBLE HOUSE IN THE LATER VICTORIAN SHAM QUEEN ANNE STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE WITH SHAM HALF TIMBERING OF CHOCOLATE PAINTED PLASTER IN THE GABLES LINCRUSTA WALTON SHAM CARVED OAK PANELS
6458-232057-0004 A TERRACE OF TERRA COTTA TO IMITATE STONE
6458-232057-0005 HIS BOYS WENT TO GOOD SOLID SCHOOLS AND WERE PUT TO RESPECTABLE PROFESSIONS HIS GIRLS IN SPITE OF A FANTASTIC PROTEST OR SO WERE ALL MARRIED TO SUITABLE STEADY OLDISH YOUNG MEN WITH GOOD PROSPECTS AND WHEN IT WAS A FIT AND PROPER THING FOR HIM TO DO SO MISTER MORRIS DIED
6458-232057-0006 HIS TOMB WAS OF MARBLE AND WITHOUT ANY ART NONSENSE OR LAUDATORY INSCRIPTION QUIETLY IMPOSING SUCH BEING THE FASHION OF HIS TIME HE UNDERWENT VARIOUS CHANGES ACCORDING TO THE ACCEPTED CUSTOM IN THESE CASES
6458-232057-0007 AND LONG BEFORE THIS STORY BEGINS HIS BONES EVEN HAD BECOME DUST AND WERE SCATTERED TO THE FOUR QUARTERS OF HEAVEN
6458-232057-0008 THEY TOO WERE DUST AND ASHES AND WERE SCATTERED LIKEWISE IT WAS A THING HE COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED
6458-232057-0009 HE HAD GRAVE DOUBTS INDEED IF THERE WAS ANY FUTURE FOR MANKIND AFTER HE WAS DEAD IT SEEMED QUITE IMPOSSIBLE AND QUITE UNINTERESTING TO IMAGINE ANYTHING HAPPENING AFTER HE WAS DEAD YET THE THING WAS SO AND WHEN EVEN HIS GREAT GREAT GRANDSON WAS DEAD AND DECAYED AND FORGOTTEN
6458-232057-0010 WHEN THE SHAM HALF TIMBERED HOUSE HAD GONE THE WAY OF ALL SHAMS AND THE TIMES WAS EXTINCT AND THE SILK HAT A RIDICULOUS ANTIQUITY
6458-232057-0011 OR INDEED OF ANYTHING BUT THEIR OWN SELVES AND PROPERTY AS MISTER MORRIS HAD BEEN AND STRANGE TO TELL
6458-232057-0012 ALL OVER THE WORLD THERE WERE SCATTERED A MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE
6458-232057-0013 IN WHOSE VEINS THE BLOOD OF MISTER MORRIS FLOWED JUST AS SOME DAY THE LIFE WHICH IS GATHERED NOW IN THE READER OF THIS VERY STORY MAY ALSO BE SCATTERED FAR AND WIDE ABOUT THIS WORLD AND MINGLED WITH A THOUSAND ALIEN STRAINS BEYOND ALL THOUGHT AND TRACING
6458-232057-0014 AND AMONG THE DESCENDANTS OF THIS MISTER MORRIS WAS ONE ALMOST AS SENSIBLE AND CLEAR HEADED AS HIS ANCESTOR HE HAD JUST THE SAME STOUT SHORT FRAME AS THAT ANCIENT MAN OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY FROM WHOM HIS NAME OF MORRIS HE SPELT IT
6458-232057-0015 HE HAD THE SAME HALF CONTEMPTUOUS EXPRESSION OF FACE HE WAS A PROSPEROUS PERSON TOO AS TIMES WENT
6458-232057-0016 JUST AS MUCH AS THE ANCESTRAL MORRIS HAD DONE
6458-232057-0017 BUT THE PHONOGRAPH MACHINE THAT TALKED TO HIM AS HE MADE HIS TOILET OF A MORNING MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE VOICE OF A REINCARNATED BLOWITZ WHEN IT DEALT WITH THE WORLD'S AFFAIRS THIS PHONOGRAPHIC MACHINE WAS THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF A DUTCH CLOCK AND DOWN THE FRONT OF IT WERE ELECTRIC BAROMETRIC INDICATORS AND AN ELECTRIC CLOCK AND CALENDAR
6458-232057-0018 AND AUTOMATIC ENGAGEMENT REMINDERS
6458-232057-0019 ABOUT THE OVERNIGHT ACCIDENTS TO THE OMNIBUS FLYING MACHINES THAT PLIED AROUND THE WORLD THE LATEST ARRIVALS AT THE FASHIONABLE RESORTS IN TIBET AND OF ALL THE GREAT MONOPOLIST COMPANY MEETINGS OF THE DAY BEFORE WHILE HE WAS DRESSING
6458-232057-0020 OF COURSE HIS TOILET DIFFERED VERY MUCH FROM THAT OF HIS ANCESTOR
6458-232057-0021 MWRES WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE SOONER GONE FORTH TO THE WORLD STARK NAKED THAN IN THE SILK HAT FROCK COAT GREY TROUSERS AND WATCH CHAIN THAT HAD FILLED MISTER MORRIS WITH SOMBRE SELF RESPECT IN THE PAST FOR MWRES THERE WAS NO SHAVING TO DO
6458-232057-0022 A SKILFUL OPERATOR HAD LONG AGO REMOVED EVERY HAIR ROOT FROM HIS FACE HIS LEGS HE ENCASED IN PLEASANT PINK AND AMBER GARMENTS OF AN AIR TIGHT MATERIAL WHICH WITH THE HELP OF AN INGENIOUS LITTLE PUMP HE DISTENDED SO AS TO SUGGEST ENORMOUS MUSCLES
6458-232057-0023 ABOVE THIS HE ALSO WORE PNEUMATIC GARMENTS BENEATH AN AMBER SILK TUNIC SO THAT HE WAS CLOTHED IN AIR AND ADMIRABLY PROTECTED AGAINST SUDDEN EXTREMES OF HEAT OR COLD OVER THIS HE FLUNG A SCARLET CLOAK WITH ITS EDGE FANTASTICALLY CURVED ON HIS HEAD WHICH HAD BEEN SKILFULLY DEPRIVED OF EVERY SCRAP OF HAIR
6458-232057-0024 HE ADJUSTED A PLEASANT LITTLE CAP OF BRIGHT SCARLET HELD ON BY SUCTION AND INFLATED WITH HYDROGEN AND CURIOUSLY LIKE THE COMB OF A COCK SO HIS TOILET WAS COMPLETE AND CONSCIOUS OF BEING SOBERLY AND BECOMINGLY ATTIRED HE WAS READY TO FACE HIS FELLOW BEINGS WITH A TRANQUIL EYE
6458-232057-0025 WAS ONE OF THE OFFICIALS UNDER THE WIND VANE AND WATERFALL TRUST THE GREAT COMPANY THAT OWNED EVERY WIND WHEEL AND WATERFALL IN THE WORLD AND WHICH PUMPED ALL THE WATER AND SUPPLIED ALL THE ELECTRIC ENERGY THAT PEOPLE IN THESE LATTER DAYS REQUIRED HE LIVED IN A VAST HOTEL NEAR THAT PART OF LONDON CALLED SEVENTH WAY
6458-232057-0026 AND INDEED THE STEADY RISE IN RENTS AND LAND VALUES
6458-232057-0027 HAD RENDERED THE SEPARATE DOMICILE OF VICTORIAN TIMES IMPOSSIBLE EVEN HAD ANY ONE DESIRED SUCH A SAVAGE SECLUSION
6458-232057-0028 THERE WERE DOORS AT OPPOSITE ENDS EACH MARKED WITH A HUGE ARROW POINTING ONE ONE WAY AND ONE THE OTHER
6458-232057-0029 ON SOME OF THESE CHAIRS WERE SEATED GAILY DRESSED MEN AND WOMEN HE NODDED TO AN ACQUAINTANCE IT WAS NOT IN THOSE DAYS ETIQUETTE TO TALK BEFORE BREAKFAST AND SEATED HIMSELF ON ONE OF THESE CHAIRS
6458-232057-0030 IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT MEAL FROM A VICTORIAN BREAKFAST
6458-232057-0031 THE STILL RECOGNISABLE FRAGMENTS OF RECENTLY KILLED ANIMALS HIDEOUSLY CHARRED AND HACKED THE EGGS TORN RUTHLESSLY FROM BENEATH SOME PROTESTING HEN
6458-232057-0032 INSTEAD WERE PASTES AND CAKES OF AGREEABLE AND VARIEGATED DESIGN
6458-232057-0033 BUT THIS WAS REALLY AN OXIDISED METALLIC SURFACE AND COULD BE CLEANED INSTANTLY AFTER A MEAL THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF SUCH LITTLE TABLES IN THE HALL AND AT MOST OF THEM WERE OTHER LATTER DAY CITIZENS SINGLY OR IN GROUPS
6458-232057-0034 WHICH HAD BEEN RESTING DURING AN INTERVAL RESUMED AND FILLED THE AIR WITH MUSIC
6458-232057-0035 HIS EYE WANDERED INCESSANTLY ABOUT THE HALL AS THOUGH HE EXPECTED A BELATED GUEST AT LAST HE ROSE EAGERLY AND WAVED HIS HAND AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ACROSS THE HALL APPEARED A TALL DARK FIGURE IN A COSTUME OF YELLOW AND OLIVE GREEN
6458-232057-0036 THE PALLID EARNESTNESS OF HIS FACE AND THE UNUSUAL INTENSITY OF HIS EYES BECAME APPARENT MWRES RESEATED HIMSELF AND POINTED TO A CHAIR BESIDE HIM I FEARED YOU WOULD NEVER COME HE SAID
6458-232057-0037 HAD NOT ONLY SAVED THE HUMAN EYESIGHT FROM DECAY
6458-232057-0038 A PROMINENT POLITICIAN AHEM SUFFERING FROM OVERWORK HE GLANCED AT THE BREAKFAST AND SEATED HIMSELF I HAVE BEEN AWAKE FOR FORTY HOURS
6458-232057-0039 YOU HYPNOTISTS HAVE YOUR WORK TO DO THE HYPNOTIST HELPED HIMSELF TO SOME ATTRACTIVE AMBER COLOURED JELLY I HAPPEN TO BE A GOOD DEAL IN REQUEST HE SAID MODESTLY
6458-232057-0040 RUMINATING THE FLAVOUR OF THE JELLY THE WORLD DID VERY WELL WITHOUT US FOR SOME THOUSANDS OF YEARS TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO EVEN NOT ONE IN PRACTICE THAT IS PHYSICIANS BY THE THOUSAND OF COURSE FRIGHTFULLY CLUMSY BRUTES FOR THE MOST PART AND FOLLOWING ONE ANOTHER LIKE SHEEP
6458-232057-0041 BUT DOCTORS OF THE MIND EXCEPT A FEW EMPIRICAL FLOUNDERERS THERE WERE NONE
6458-232057-0042 THE HYPNOTIST SHOOK HIS HEAD IT DIDN'T MATTER THEN IF THEY WERE A BIT SILLY OR FADDY LIFE WAS SO EASY GOING THEN NO COMPETITION WORTH SPEAKING OF NO PRESSURE A HUMAN BEING HAD TO BE VERY LOPSIDED BEFORE ANYTHING HAPPENED
6458-232057-0043 THEN YOU KNOW THEY CLAPPED EM AWAY IN WHAT THEY CALLED A LUNATIC ASYLUM
6458-232057-0044 I MUST CONFESS I DO SAID THE HYPNOTIST
6458-232057-0045 WHEN MEN WERE STOUT AND WOMEN SIMPLE I LIKE A GOOD SWAGGERING STORY BEFORE ALL THINGS CURIOUS TIMES THEY WERE WITH THEIR SMUTTY RAILWAYS AND PUFFING OLD IRON TRAINS THEIR RUM LITTLE HOUSES AND THEIR HORSE VEHICLES I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T READ BOOKS
6458-232057-0046 PHONOGRAPHS ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME OF COURSE SAID THE HYPNOTIST OF COURSE AND SURVEYED THE TABLE FOR HIS NEXT CHOICE YOU KNOW HE SAID HELPING HIMSELF TO A DARK BLUE CONFECTION THAT PROMISED WELL IN THOSE DAYS OUR BUSINESS WAS SCARCELY THOUGHT OF
6458-232057-0047 FEW PEOPLE KNEW THAT AN ORDER MADE DURING A MESMERIC TRANCE
6458-232057-0048 COULD BE GIVEN SO AS TO BE OBEYED AFTER THE TRANCE WAS OVER
6458-232057-0049 BRINGS ME AH TO THE MATTER I AH HAD IN MIND WHEN I ASKED YOU WHEN I EXPRESSED A WISH TO SEE YOU
6458-232057-0050 I HAVE A IN FACT A DAUGHTER WELL YOU KNOW I HAVE GIVEN HER AH EVERY EDUCATIONAL ADVANTAGE LECTURES NOT A SOLITARY LECTURER OF ABILITY IN THE WORLD
6458-232057-0051 DANCING DEPORTMENT CONVERSATION PHILOSOPHY ART CRITICISM HE INDICATED CATHOLIC CULTURE BY A GESTURE OF HIS HAND I HAD INTENDED HER TO MARRY A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE BINDON OF THE LIGHTING COMMISSION
6458-232057-0052 PLAIN LITTLE MAN YOU KNOW AND A BIT UNPLEASANT IN SOME OF HIS WAYS BUT AN EXCELLENT FELLOW REALLY AN EXCELLENT FELLOW YES SAID THE HYPNOTIST GO ON HOW OLD IS SHE
6458-232057-0053 A DANGEROUS AGE WELL
6458-232057-0054 EGYPTIANS VERY PROBABLY HACK ABOUT WITH SWORDS AND REVOLVERS AND THINGS BLOODSHED GALORE HORRIBLE
6458-232057-0055 AND ALL SORTS OF IRREGULAR ADVENTURERS AND SHE HAS GOT IT INTO HER HEAD THAT SHE MUST MARRY FOR LOVE AND THAT POOR LITTLE BINDON
6458-232057-0056 WHO IS THE OTHER YOUNG MAN MWRES MAINTAINED AN APPEARANCE OF RESIGNED CALM YOU MAY WELL ASK HE SAID HE IS AND HIS VOICE SANK WITH SHAME A MERE ATTENDANT UPON THE STAGE ON WHICH THE FLYING MACHINES FROM PARIS ALIGHT
6458-232057-0057 HE HAS AS THEY SAY IN THE ROMANCES GOOD LOOKS HE IS QUITE YOUNG AND VERY ECCENTRIC AFFECTS THE ANTIQUE HE CAN READ AND WRITE SO CAN SHE
6458-232057-0058 TRIPPED COMING DOWN FROM THE FLYING MACHINE FROM PARIS AND FELL INTO HIS ARMS THE MISCHIEF WAS DONE IN A MOMENT YES WELL THAT'S ALL THINGS MUST BE STOPPED
6458-232057-0059 WHAT MUST BE DONE WHAT CAN BE DONE OF COURSE I'M NOT A HYPNOTIST MY KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED BUT YOU HYPNOTISM IS NOT MAGIC SAID THE MAN IN GREEN PUTTING BOTH ARMS ON THE TABLE
6458-232057-0060 PRECISELY BUT THE PROBLEM IS TO GET HER HYPNOTISED OF COURSE NO SORT OF PROPOSAL OR SUGGESTION MUST COME FROM YOU
6458-232057-0061 AND BY THE BYE IS THERE ANY MONEY IN THE AFFAIR MWRES HESITATED THERE'S A SUM IN FACT A CONSIDERABLE SUM INVESTED IN THE PATENT ROAD COMPANY FROM HER MOTHER THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE THING SO EXASPERATING
6458-232057-0062 IT WAS A LENGTHY INTERVIEW AND MEANWHILE
6458-232057-0063 WAS SITTING IN A QUIET WAITING PLACE BENEATH THE GREAT STAGE UPON WHICH THE FLYING MACHINE FROM PARIS DESCENDED AND BESIDE HER SAT HER SLENDER HANDSOME LOVER READING HER THE POEM HE HAD WRITTEN THAT MORNING WHILE ON DUTY UPON THE STAGE WHEN HE HAD FINISHED THEY SAT FOR A TIME IN SILENCE
6458-232057-0064 THE GREAT MACHINE THAT HAD COME FLYING THROUGH THE AIR FROM AMERICA THAT MORNING RUSHED DOWN OUT OF THE SKY AT FIRST IT WAS A LITTLE OBLONG FAINT AND BLUE AMIDST THE DISTANT FLEECY CLOUDS AND THEN IT GREW SWIFTLY LARGE AND WHITE AND LARGER AND WHITER UNTIL THEY COULD SEE THE SEPARATE TIERS OF SAILS
6458-232057-0065 AND OVER THE ROOF SPACES OF THE CITY BELOW ITS SHADOW LEAPT TOWARDS THEM THEY HEARD THE WHISTLING RUSH OF THE AIR ABOUT IT AND ITS YELLING SIREN SHRILL AND SWELLING TO WARN THOSE WHO WERE ON ITS LANDING STAGE OF ITS ARRIVAL AND ABRUPTLY THE NOTE FELL DOWN A COUPLE OF OCTAVES
6458-232057-0066 THEIR SILENCE ENDED AND DENTON SPEAKING IN A LITTLE LANGUAGE OF BROKEN ENGLISH THAT WAS THEY FANCIED THEIR PRIVATE POSSESSION THOUGH LOVERS HAVE USED SUCH LITTLE LANGUAGES SINCE THE WORLD BEGAN TOLD HER HOW THEY TOO WOULD LEAP INTO THE AIR ONE MORNING OUT OF ALL THE OBSTACLES AND DIFFICULTIES ABOUT THEM
6458-232057-0067 THEY PARTED AS LOVERS HAVE BEEN WONT TO PART FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS
6458-232057-0068 ALL GLAZED IN WITH GLASS FROM THE WEATHER AND WITH INCESSANT MOVING PLATFORMS THAT WENT TO ALL PARTS OF THE CITY AND BY ONE OF THESE SHE RETURNED TO HER APARTMENTS IN THE HOTEL FOR WOMEN WHERE SHE LIVED THE APARTMENTS THAT WERE IN TELEPHONIC COMMUNICATION WITH ALL THE BEST LECTURERS IN THE WORLD
6458-232057-0069 BUT THE SUNLIGHT OF THE FLYING STAGE WAS IN HER HEART AND THE WISDOM OF ALL THE BEST LECTURERS IN THE WORLD SEEMED FOLLY IN THAT LIGHT SHE SPENT THE MIDDLE PART OF THE DAY IN THE GYMNASIUM AND TOOK HER MIDDAY MEAL WITH TWO OTHER GIRLS AND THEIR COMMON CHAPERONE
6458-232057-0070 THE CHAPERONE HAD A VISITOR THAT DAY
6458-232057-0071 WHO TALKED AMAZINGLY AMONG OTHER THINGS HE FELL TO PRAISING A NEW HISTORICAL ROMANCE THAT ONE OF THE GREAT POPULAR STORY TELLERS OF THE DAY HAD JUST PUT FORTH IT WAS OF COURSE ABOUT THE SPACIOUS TIMES OF QUEEN VICTORIA
6458-232057-0072 AND THE AUTHOR AMONG OTHER PLEASING NOVELTIES MADE A LITTLE ARGUMENT BEFORE EACH SECTION OF THE STORY IN IMITATION OF THE CHAPTER HEADINGS OF THE OLD FASHIONED BOOKS AS FOR EXAMPLE HOW THE CABMEN OF PIMLICO STOPPED THE VICTORIA OMNIBUSES
6458-232057-0073 AND OF THE GREAT FIGHT IN PALACE YARD AND HOW THE PICCADILLY POLICEMAN WAS SLAIN IN THE MIDST OF HIS DUTY THE MAN IN GREEN AND YELLOW PRAISED THIS INNOVATION THESE PITHY SENTENCES HE SAID ARE ADMIRABLE
6458-232057-0074 THEY WERE STILL PARTS OF THE WORLD ABSOLUTELY UNEXPLORED NOWADAYS WE HAVE ALMOST ABOLISHED WONDER WE LEAD LIVES SO TRIM AND ORDERLY THAT COURAGE ENDURANCE FAITH ALL THE NOBLE VIRTUES SEEM FADING FROM MANKIND
6458-232057-0075 AND SO ON TAKING THE GIRLS THOUGHTS WITH HIM UNTIL THE LIFE THEY LED LIFE IN THE VAST AND INTRICATE LONDON OF THE TWENTY SECOND CENTURY A LIFE INTERSPERSED WITH SOARING EXCURSIONS TO EVERY PART OF THE GLOBE
6458-232057-0076 AT FIRST ELIZABETH DID NOT JOIN IN THE CONVERSATION BUT AFTER A TIME THE SUBJECT BECAME SO INTERESTING THAT SHE MADE A FEW SHY INTERPOLATIONS
6458-232057-0077 HE WENT ON TO DESCRIBE A NEW METHOD OF ENTERTAINING PEOPLE
6458-232057-0078 IT IS A THING WE HAVE SOUGHT TO DO FOR YEARS AND YEARS SAID THE HYPNOTIST IT IS PRACTICALLY AN ARTIFICIAL DREAM AND WE KNOW THE WAY AT LAST THINK OF ALL IT OPENS OUT TO US THE ENRICHMENT OF OUR EXPERIENCE THE RECOVERY OF ADVENTURE
6458-232057-0079 THE REFUGE IT OFFERS FROM THIS SORDID COMPETITIVE LIFE IN WHICH WE LIVE THINK AND YOU CAN DO THAT SAID THE CHAPERONE EAGERLY THE THING IS POSSIBLE AT LAST THE HYPNOTIST SAID YOU MAY ORDER A DREAM AS YOU WISH
6458-232057-0080 THE CHAPERONE WAS THE FIRST TO BE HYPNOTISED AND THE DREAM SHE SAID WAS WONDERFUL WHEN SHE CAME TO AGAIN
6458-232057-0081 AND HAD PLUNGES INTO THE ROMANTIC PAST NO ONE SUGGESTED THAT ELIZABETH SHOULD TRY THIS NOVEL ENTERTAINMENT IT WAS AT HER OWN REQUEST AT LAST THAT SHE WAS TAKEN INTO THAT LAND OF DREAMS WHERE THERE IS NEITHER ANY FREEDOM OF CHOICE NOR WILL AND SO THE MISCHIEF WAS DONE
6458-232057-0082 ONE DAY WHEN DENTON WENT DOWN TO THAT QUIET SEAT BENEATH THE FLYING STAGE ELIZABETH WAS NOT IN HER WONTED PLACE HE WAS DISAPPOINTED AND A LITTLE ANGRY
6458-232057-0083 AND THE NEXT ALSO HE WAS AFRAID TO HIDE HIS FEAR FROM HIMSELF HE SET TO WORK TO WRITE SONNETS FOR HER WHEN SHE SHOULD COME AGAIN FOR THREE DAYS HE FOUGHT AGAINST HIS DREAD BY SUCH DISTRACTION AND THEN THE TRUTH WAS BEFORE HIM CLEAR AND COLD AND WOULD NOT BE DENIED
6458-232057-0084 SHE MIGHT BE ILL SHE MIGHT BE DEAD
6458-232057-0085 THERE FOLLOWED A WEEK OF MISERY AND THEN HE KNEW SHE WAS THE ONLY THING ON EARTH WORTH HAVING
6458-232057-0086 UNTIL SHE WAS FOUND ONCE MORE HE HAD SOME SMALL PRIVATE MEANS OF HIS OWN AND SO HE THREW OVER HIS APPOINTMENT ON THE FLYING STAGE AND SET HIMSELF TO FIND THIS GIRL WHO HAD BECOME AT LAST ALL THE WORLD TO HIM HE DID NOT KNOW WHERE SHE LIVED AND LITTLE OF HER CIRCUMSTANCES
6458-232057-0087 EVEN IN VICTORIAN DAYS LONDON WAS A MAZE THAT LITTLE LONDON WITH ITS POOR FOUR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BUT THE LONDON HE EXPLORED THE LONDON OF THE TWENTY SECOND CENTURY WAS A LONDON OF THIRTY MILLION SOULS AT FIRST HE WAS ENERGETIC AND HEADLONG
6458-232057-0088 TAKING TIME NEITHER TO EAT NOR SLEEP HE SOUGHT FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS HE WENT THROUGH EVERY IMAGINABLE PHASE OF FATIGUE AND DESPAIR OVER EXCITEMENT AND ANGER LONG AFTER HOPE WAS DEAD BY THE SHEER INERTIA OF HIS DESIRE HE STILL WENT TO AND FRO
6458-232057-0089 PEERING INTO FACES AND LOOKING THIS WAY AND THAT IN THE INCESSANT WAYS AND LIFTS AND PASSAGES OF THAT INTERMINABLE HIVE OF MEN
6458-232057-0090 HE WAS HUNGRY HE HAD PAID THE INCLUSIVE FEE AND HAD GONE INTO ONE OF THE GIGANTIC DINING PLACES OF THE CITY HE WAS PUSHING HIS WAY AMONG THE TABLES AND SCRUTINISING BY MERE FORCE OF HABIT EVERY GROUP HE PASSED HE STOOD STILL ROBBED OF ALL POWER OF MOTION
6458-232057-0091 HIS EYES WIDE HIS LIPS APART ELIZABETH SAT SCARCELY TWENTY YARDS AWAY FROM HIM LOOKING STRAIGHT AT HIM HER EYES WERE AS HARD TO HIM AS HARD AND EXPRESSIONLESS AND VOID OF RECOGNITION AS THE EYES OF A STATUE
6458-232057-0092 AND THEN HER GAZE PASSED BEYOND HIM HAD HE HAD ONLY HER EYES TO JUDGE BY HE MIGHT HAVE DOUBTED IF IT WAS INDEED ELIZABETH BUT HE KNEW HER BY THE GESTURE OF HER HAND BY THE GRACE OF A WANTON LITTLE CURL THAT FLOATED OVER HER EAR AS SHE MOVED HER HEAD
6458-232057-0093 SOMETHING WAS SAID TO HER AND SHE TURNED SMILING TOLERANTLY TO THE MAN BESIDE HER
6458-232057-0094 AND FOR A TIME HE DID NOT DARE TO LOOK AT HER AGAIN WHEN AT LAST HE DID SHE AND BINDON AND TWO OTHER PEOPLE WERE STANDING UP TO GO
6458-232057-0095 HE SAT AS IF INCAPABLE OF ACTION UNTIL THE FOUR FIGURES WERE REMOTE AND SMALL AND THEN HE ROSE UP POSSESSED WITH THE ONE IDEA OF PURSUIT
6458-232057-0096 HE COULD NOT CONTROL HIMSELF TO PATIENCE HE FELT HE MUST SPEAK TO HER FORTHWITH OR DIE HE PUSHED FORWARD TO WHERE THEY WERE SEATED AND SAT DOWN BESIDE THEM HIS WHITE FACE WAS CONVULSED WITH HALF HYSTERICAL EXCITEMENT HE LAID HIS HAND ON HER WRIST
6458-232057-0097 ELIZABETH HE SAID SHE TURNED IN UNFEIGNED ASTONISHMENT NOTHING BUT THE FEAR OF A STRANGE MAN SHOWED IN HER FACE ELIZABETH
6458-232057-0098 DEAREST YOU KNOW ME ELIZABETH'S FACE SHOWED NOTHING BUT ALARM AND PERPLEXITY SHE DREW HERSELF AWAY FROM HIM THE CHAPERONE A LITTLE GREY HEADED WOMAN WITH MOBILE FEATURES
6458-232057-0099 AND WITH A HAND TO HER FOREHEAD SPEAKING ALMOST AS ONE WHO REPEATS A LESSON NO I DO NOT KNOW HIM I KNOW I DO NOT KNOW HIM BUT BUT NOT KNOW ME IT IS I DENTON DENTON
6458-232057-0100 DON'T YOU REMEMBER THE FLYING STAGES THE LITTLE SEAT IN THE OPEN AIR THE VERSES NO CRIED ELIZABETH NO I DO NOT KNOW HIM
6458-232057-0101 THERE IS SOMETHING BUT I DON'T KNOW ALL I KNOW IS THAT I DO NOT KNOW HIM HER FACE WAS A FACE OF INFINITE DISTRESS
6458-232057-0102 YOU SEE SHE SAID WITH THE FAINT SHADOW OF A SMILE SHE DOES NOT KNOW YOU I DO NOT KNOW YOU SAID ELIZABETH OF THAT I AM SURE BUT DEAR THE SONGS THE LITTLE VERSES SHE DOES NOT KNOW YOU SAID THE CHAPERONE
6458-232057-0103 YOU MUST NOT YOU HAVE MADE A MISTAKE YOU MUST NOT GO ON TALKING TO US AFTER THAT YOU MUST NOT ANNOY US ON THE PUBLIC WAYS BUT SAID DENTON AND FOR A MOMENT HIS MISERABLY HAGGARD FACE APPEALED AGAINST FATE
6458-232057-0104 YOU MUST NOT PERSIST YOUNG MAN PROTESTED THE CHAPERONE ELIZABETH HE CRIED HER FACE WAS THE FACE OF ONE WHO IS TORMENTED I DO NOT KNOW YOU SHE CRIED HAND TO BROW OH I DO NOT KNOW YOU
6458-232057-0105 FOR AN INSTANT DENTON SAT STUNNED THEN HE STOOD UP AND GROANED ALOUD HE MADE A STRANGE GESTURE OF APPEAL TOWARDS THE REMOTE GLASS ROOF OF THE PUBLIC WAY
6458-232057-0106 THEN TURNED AND WENT PLUNGING RECKLESSLY FROM ONE MOVING PLATFORM TO ANOTHER AND VANISHED AMIDST THE SWARMS OF PEOPLE GOING TO AND FRO THEREON THE CHAPERONE'S EYES FOLLOWED HIM AND THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE CURIOUS FACES ABOUT HER
6458-232057-0107 I HAVE NEVER SET EYES ON HIM BEFORE NEVER NEVER DEAR DO NOT TROUBLE YOUR MIND ABOUT A THING LIKE THIS AND SOON AFTER THIS THE CELEBRATED HYPNOTIST WHO DRESSED IN GREEN AND YELLOW HAD ANOTHER CLIENT
6458-232057-0108 I WANT TO FORGET HE CRIED I MUST FORGET THE HYPNOTIST WATCHED HIM WITH QUIET EYES STUDIED HIS FACE AND CLOTHES AND BEARING TO FORGET ANYTHING PLEASURE OR PAIN IS TO BE BY SO MUCH LESS
6458-232057-0109 HOWEVER YOU KNOW YOUR OWN CONCERN MY FEE IS HIGH IF ONLY I CAN FORGET THAT'S EASY ENOUGH WITH YOU YOU WISH IT I'VE DONE MUCH HARDER THINGS QUITE RECENTLY I HARDLY EXPECTED TO DO IT
6458-232057-0110 THE THING WAS DONE AGAINST THE WILL OF THE HYPNOTISED PERSON A LOVE AFFAIR TOO LIKE YOURS A GIRL SO REST ASSURED
6458-232057-0111 HIS MANNER WAS A FORCED CALM HE LOOKED INTO THE HYPNOTIST'S EYES I WILL TELL YOU
6458-232057-0112 WELL HE STOPPED
6458-232057-0113 IN THAT INSTANT HE KNEW HE STOOD UP HE SEEMED TO DOMINATE THE SEATED FIGURE BY HIS SIDE HE GRIPPED THE SHOULDER OF GREEN AND GOLD FOR A TIME HE COULD NOT FIND WORDS GIVE HER ME BACK HE SAID AT LAST GIVE HER ME BACK
6458-232057-0114 IN A MOMENT THE TWO MEN WERE LOCKED IN A CLUMSY WRESTLE NEITHER HAD THE SLIGHTEST TRAINING FOR ATHLETICISM EXCEPT FOR EXHIBITION AND TO AFFORD OPPORTUNITY FOR BETTING
6458-232057-0115 BUT DENTON WAS NOT ONLY THE YOUNGER BUT THE STRONGER OF THE TWO THEY SWAYED ACROSS THE ROOM AND THEN THE HYPNOTIST HAD GONE DOWN UNDER HIS ANTAGONIST THEY FELL TOGETHER DENTON LEAPED TO HIS FEET DISMAYED AT HIS OWN FURY BUT THE HYPNOTIST LAY STILL
6458-232057-0116 FOR A SPACE DENTON STOOD OVER HIM IRRESOLUTE TREMBLING A FEAR OF THE CONSEQUENCES ENTERED HIS GENTLY NURTURED MIND HE TURNED TOWARDS THE DOOR NO HE SAID ALOUD AND CAME BACK TO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM
6458-232057-0117 HE KNELT DOWN BESIDE HIS ANTAGONIST AND FELT HIS HEART THEN HE PEERED AT THE WOUND HE ROSE QUIETLY AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM HE BEGAN TO SEE MORE OF THE SITUATION WHEN PRESENTLY THE HYPNOTIST RECOVERED HIS SENSES HIS HEAD ACHED SEVERELY
6458-232057-0118 BUT PRESENTLY HE INDICATED BY A GESTURE THAT IN HIS OPINION HE HAD BEEN SPONGED ENOUGH LET ME GET UP HE SAID NOT YET SAID DENTON
6458-232057-0119 THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THOUGHT UNLESS I SPONGE SAID DENTON YOUR FOREHEAD WILL DEVELOP A TREMENDOUS BRUISE YOU CAN GO ON SPONGING SAID THE HYPNOTIST SULKILY THERE WAS ANOTHER PAUSE WE MIGHT BE IN THE STONE AGE SAID THE HYPNOTIST VIOLENCE STRUGGLE
6458-232057-0120 IN THE STONE AGE NO MAN DARED TO COME BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN SAID DENTON THE HYPNOTIST THOUGHT AGAIN
6458-232057-0121 WHILE YOU WERE INSENSIBLE I FOUND THE GIRL'S ADDRESS ON YOUR TABLETS I DID NOT KNOW IT BEFORE I TELEPHONED SHE WILL BE HERE SOON THEN SHE WILL BRING HER CHAPERONE THAT IS ALL RIGHT BUT WHAT
6458-232057-0122 I LOOKED ABOUT FOR A WEAPON ALSO IT IS AN ASTONISHING THING HOW FEW WEAPONS THERE ARE NOWADAYS IF YOU CONSIDER THAT IN THE STONE AGE MEN OWNED SCARCELY ANYTHING BUT WEAPONS I HIT AT LAST UPON THIS LAMP
6458-232057-0123 HE EXTENDED IT OVER THE HYPNOTIST'S SHOULDERS WITH THAT I CAN QUITE EASILY SMASH YOUR SKULL I WILL UNLESS YOU DO AS I TELL YOU VIOLENCE IS NO REMEDY SAID THE HYPNOTIST QUOTING FROM THE MODERN MAN'S BOOK OF MORAL MAXIMS
6458-232057-0124 IT'S AN UNDESIRABLE DISEASE SAID DENTON WELL
6458-232057-0125 WITH THE RED HAIR AND FERRETY EYES I BELIEVE THAT'S HOW THINGS STAND YES THAT'S HOW THINGS STAND AND PRETENDING TO DO THAT YOU WILL RESTORE HER MEMORY OF ME IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL LOOK HERE IF I CANNOT HAVE THAT GIRL I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN NOT
6458-232057-0126 IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG YOU SHALL NOT LIVE FIVE MINUTES THIS IS A RUDE MAKESHIFT OF A WEAPON AND IT MAY QUITE CONCEIVABLY BE PAINFUL TO KILL YOU
6458-232057-0127 MAINLY BECAUSE THERE IS SO LITTLE IN LIFE THAT IS WORTH BEING VIOLENT ABOUT THE CHAPERONE WILL SEE YOU DIRECTLY SHE COMES
6458-232057-0128 THE HYPNOTIST THOUGHT YOU ARE A DETERMINED YOUNG MAN HE SAID AND ONLY HALF CIVILISED I HAVE TRIED TO DO MY DUTY TO MY CLIENT BUT IN THIS AFFAIR YOU SEEM LIKELY TO GET YOUR OWN WAY
6458-232057-0129 AND AFTERWARDS THERE IS NOTHING A HYPNOTIST OR DOCTOR HATES SO MUCH AS A SCANDAL
