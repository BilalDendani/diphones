8259-276913-0000 CHAPTER ONE IN WHICH CAPTAIN BOOTH BEGINS TO RELATE HIS HISTORY THE TEA TABLE BEING REMOVED AND MISTER BOOTH AND THE LADY LEFT ALONE HE PROCEEDED AS FOLLOWS SINCE YOU DESIRE MADAM TO KNOW THE PARTICULARS OF MY COURTSHIP
8259-276913-0001 TO THAT BEST AND DEAREST OF WOMEN WHOM I AFTERWARDS MARRIED I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO RECOLLECT THEM AS WELL AS I CAN AT LEAST ALL THOSE INCIDENTS WHICH ARE MOST WORTH RELATING TO YOU IF THE VULGAR OPINION OF THE FATALITY IN MARRIAGE HAD EVER ANY FOUNDATION
8259-276913-0002 IT SURELY APPEARED IN MY MARRIAGE WITH MY AMELIA I KNEW HER IN THE FIRST DAWN OF HER BEAUTY AND I BELIEVE MADAM SHE HAD AS MUCH AS EVER FELL TO THE SHARE OF A WOMAN BUT THOUGH I ALWAYS ADMIRED HER IT WAS LONG WITHOUT ANY SPARK OF LOVE
8259-276913-0003 PERHAPS THE GENERAL ADMIRATION WHICH AT THAT TIME PURSUED HER THE RESPECT PAID HER BY PERSONS OF THE HIGHEST RANK AND THE NUMBERLESS ADDRESSES WHICH WERE MADE HER BY MEN OF GREAT FORTUNE
8259-276913-0004 PREVENTED MY ASPIRING AT THE POSSESSION OF THOSE CHARMS WHICH SEEMED SO ABSOLUTELY OUT OF MY REACH HOWEVER IT WAS I ASSURE YOU THE ACCIDENT WHICH DEPRIVED HER OF THE ADMIRATION OF OTHERS MADE THE FIRST GREAT IMPRESSION ON MY HEART IN HER FAVOUR
8259-276913-0005 THE INJURY DONE TO HER BEAUTY BY THE OVERTURNING OF A CHAISE BY WHICH AS YOU MAY WELL REMEMBER HER LOVELY NOSE WAS BEAT ALL TO PIECES GAVE ME AN ASSURANCE THAT THE WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN SO MUCH ADORED FOR THE CHARMS OF HER PERSON DESERVED A MUCH HIGHER ADORATION TO BE PAID TO HER MIND
8259-276913-0006 FOR THAT SHE WAS IN THE LATTER RESPECT INFINITELY MORE SUPERIOR TO THE REST OF HER SEX THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN IN THE FORMER I ADMIRE YOUR TASTE EXTREMELY CRIED THE LADY I REMEMBER PERFECTLY WELL THE GREAT HEROISM WITH WHICH YOUR AMELIA BORE THAT MISFORTUNE
8259-276913-0007 GOOD HEAVENS MADAM ANSWERED HE WHAT A MAGNANIMITY OF MIND DID HER BEHAVIOUR DEMONSTRATE IF THE WORLD HAVE EXTOLLED THE FIRMNESS OF SOUL IN A MAN WHO CAN SUPPORT THE LOSS OF FORTUNE OF A GENERAL WHO CAN BE COMPOSED AFTER THE LOSS OF A VICTORY
8259-276913-0008 WITH WHAT ASTONISHMENT OUGHT WE TO BEHOLD WITH WHAT PRAISES TO HONOUR A YOUNG LADY WHO CAN WITH PATIENCE AND RESIGNATION SUBMIT TO THE LOSS OF EXQUISITE BEAUTY IN OTHER WORDS TO THE LOSS OF FORTUNE POWER GLORY
8259-276913-0009 EVERYTHING WHICH HUMAN NATURE IS APT TO COURT AND REJOICE IN WHAT MUST BE THE MIND WHICH CAN BEAR TO BE DEPRIVED OF ALL THESE IN A MOMENT AND BY AN UNFORTUNATE TRIFLING ACCIDENT WHICH COULD SUPPORT ALL THIS TOGETHER WITH THE MOST EXQUISITE TORMENTS OF BODY
8259-276913-0010 AND WITH DIGNITY WITH RESIGNATION WITHOUT COMPLAINING ALMOST WITHOUT A TEAR UNDERGO THE MOST PAINFUL AND DREADFUL OPERATIONS OF SURGERY IN SUCH A SITUATION HERE HE STOPT AND A TORRENT OF TEARS GUSHED FROM HIS EYES
8259-276913-0011 SUCH TEARS ARE APT TO FLOW FROM A TRULY NOBLE HEART AT THE HEARING OF ANYTHING SURPRISINGLY GREAT AND GLORIOUS AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE HE AGAIN PROCEEDED THUS WOULD YOU THINK MISS MATTHEWS THAT THE MISFORTUNE OF MY AMELIA WAS CAPABLE OF ANY AGGRAVATION I ASSURE YOU
8259-276913-0012 WITH A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH OUTWEIGHED ALL THE OTHER INGREDIENTS THIS WAS THE CRUEL INSULTS SHE RECEIVED FROM SOME OF HER MOST INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE SEVERAL OF WHOM AFTER MANY DISTORTIONS AND GRIMACES HAVE TURNED THEIR HEADS ASIDE UNABLE TO SUPPORT THEIR SECRET TRIUMPH
8259-276913-0013 AND BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH IN HER HEARING GOOD HEAVENS CRIED MISS MATTHEWS WHAT DETESTABLE ACTIONS WILL THIS CONTEMPTIBLE PASSION OF ENVY PREVAIL ON OUR SEX TO COMMIT AN OCCASION OF THIS KIND AS SHE HATH SINCE TOLD ME
8259-276913-0014 MADE THE FIRST IMPRESSION ON HER GENTLE HEART IN MY FAVOUR I WAS ONE DAY IN COMPANY WITH SEVERAL YOUNG LADIES OR RATHER YOUNG DEVILS WHERE POOR AMELIA'S ACCIDENT WAS THE SUBJECT OF MUCH MIRTH AND PLEASANTRY
8259-276913-0015 ONE OF THESE SAID SHE HOPED MISS WOULD NOT HOLD HER HEAD SO HIGH FOR THE FUTURE ANOTHER ANSWERED I DO NOT KNOW MADAM WHAT SHE MAY DO WITH HER HEAD BUT I AM CONVINCED SHE WILL NEVER MORE TURN UP HER NOSE AT HER BETTERS ANOTHER CRIED
8259-276913-0016 WHAT A VERY PROPER MATCH MIGHT NOW BE MADE BETWEEN AMELIA AND A CERTAIN CAPTAIN WHO HAD UNFORTUNATELY RECEIVED AN INJURY IN THE SAME PART THOUGH FROM NO SHAMEFUL CAUSE MANY OTHER SARCASMS WERE THROWN OUT VERY UNWORTHY TO BE REPEATED
8259-276913-0017 I WAS HURT WITH PERCEIVING SO MUCH MALICE IN HUMAN SHAPE AND CRIED OUT VERY BLUNTLY INDEED LADIES YOU NEED NOT EXPRESS SUCH SATISFACTION AT POOR MISS EMILY'S ACCIDENT FOR SHE WILL STILL BE THE HANDSOMEST WOMAN IN ENGLAND
8259-276913-0018 THIS SPEECH OF MINE WAS AFTERWARDS VARIOUSLY REPEATED BY SOME TO MY HONOUR AND BY OTHERS REPRESENTED IN A CONTRARY LIGHT INDEED IT WAS OFTEN REPORTED TO BE MUCH RUDER THAN IT WAS HOWEVER IT AT LENGTH REACHED AMELIA'S EARS SHE SAID SHE WAS VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO ME
8259-276913-0019 SINCE I COULD HAVE SO MUCH COMPASSION FOR HER AS TO BE RUDE TO A LADY ON HER ACCOUNT ABOUT A MONTH AFTER THE ACCIDENT WHEN AMELIA BEGAN TO SEE COMPANY IN A MASK I HAD THE HONOUR TO DRINK TEA WITH HER
8259-276913-0020 PERHAPS MISTER BOOTH YOU WILL AS LITTLE KNOW ME WHEN MY MASK IS OFF AS WHEN IT IS ON AND AT THE SAME INSTANT UNMASKED THE SURGEON'S SKILL WAS THE LEAST I CONSIDERED A THOUSAND TENDER IDEAS RUSHED ALL AT ONCE ON MY MIND
8259-276913-0021 I WAS UNABLE TO CONTAIN MYSELF AND EAGERLY KISSING HER HAND I CRIED UPON MY SOUL MADAM
8259-276913-0022 NOTHING MORE REMARKABLE PASSED AT THIS VISIT BUT I SINCERELY BELIEVE WE WERE NEITHER OF US HEREAFTER INDIFFERENT TO EACH OTHER MANY MONTHS HOWEVER PASSED AFTER THIS BEFORE I EVER THOUGHT SERIOUSLY OF MAKING HER MY WIFE
8259-276913-0023 NOT THAT I WANTED SUFFICIENT LOVE FOR AMELIA INDEED IT AROSE FROM THE VAST AFFECTION I BORE HER I CONSIDERED MY OWN AS A DESPERATE FORTUNE HERS AS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON HER MOTHER WHO WAS A WOMAN YOU KNOW OF VIOLENT PASSIONS
8259-276913-0024 AND VERY UNLIKELY TO CONSENT TO A MATCH SO HIGHLY CONTRARY TO THE INTEREST OF HER DAUGHTER THE MORE I LOVED AMELIA THE MORE FIRMLY I RESOLVED WITHIN MYSELF NEVER TO PROPOSE LOVE TO HER SERIOUSLY SUCH A DUPE WAS MY UNDERSTANDING TO MY HEART
8259-276913-0025 AND SO FOOLISHLY DID I IMAGINE I COULD BE MASTER OF A FLAME TO WHICH I WAS EVERY DAY ADDING FUEL O MISS MATTHEWS WE HAVE HEARD OF MEN ENTIRELY MASTERS OF THEIR PASSIONS AND OF HEARTS WHICH CAN CARRY THIS FIRE IN THEM AND CONCEAL IT AT THEIR PLEASURE
8259-276913-0026 PERHAPS THERE MAY BE SUCH BUT IF THERE ARE THOSE HEARTS MAY BE COMPARED I BELIEVE TO DAMPS IN WHICH IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO KEEP FIRE ALIVE THAN TO PREVENT ITS BLAZING IN MINE IT WAS PLACED IN THE MIDST OF COMBUSTIBLE MATTER AFTER SEVERAL VISITS
8259-276913-0027 IN WHICH LOOKS AND SIGHS HAD BEEN INTERCHANGED ON BOTH SIDES BUT WITHOUT THE LEAST MENTION OF PASSION IN PRIVATE ONE DAY THE DISCOURSE BETWEEN US WHEN ALONE HAPPENED TO TURN ON LOVE I SAY HAPPENED FOR I PROTEST IT WAS NOT DESIGNED ON MY SIDE
8259-276913-0028 AND I AM AS FIRMLY CONVINCED NOT ON HERS I WAS NOW NO LONGER MASTER OF MYSELF I DECLARED MYSELF THE MOST WRETCHED OF ALL MARTYRS TO THIS TENDER PASSION THAT I HAD LONG CONCEALED IT FROM ITS OBJECT AT LENGTH
8259-276913-0029 AFTER MENTIONING MANY PARTICULARS SUPPRESSING HOWEVER THOSE WHICH MUST HAVE NECESSARILY BROUGHT IT HOME TO AMELIA I CONCLUDED WITH BEGGING HER TO BE THE CONFIDANTE OF MY AMOUR AND TO GIVE ME HER ADVICE ON THAT OCCASION AMELIA O I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE DEAR PERTURBATION
8259-276913-0030 APPEARED ALL CONFUSION AT THIS INSTANT SHE TREMBLED TURNED PALE AND DISCOVERED HOW WELL SHE UNDERSTOOD ME BY A THOUSAND MORE SYMPTOMS THAN I COULD TAKE NOTICE OF IN A STATE OF MIND SO VERY LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM HER OWN AT LAST WITH FALTERING ACCENTS
8259-276913-0031 SHE SAID I HAD MADE A VERY ILL CHOICE OF A COUNSELLOR IN A MATTER IN WHICH SHE WAS SO IGNORANT ADDING AT LAST I BELIEVE MISTER BOOTH YOU GENTLEMEN WANT VERY LITTLE ADVICE IN THESE AFFAIRS WHICH YOU ALL UNDERSTAND BETTER THAN WE DO
8259-276913-0032 I WILL RELATE NO MORE OF OUR CONVERSATION AT PRESENT INDEED I AM AFRAID I TIRE YOU WITH TOO MANY PARTICULARS O NO ANSWERED SHE
8259-276913-0033 TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU SAID OR DID IF YOU CAN REMEMBER IT
