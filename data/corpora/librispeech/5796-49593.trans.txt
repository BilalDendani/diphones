5796-49593-0000 BUT SUDDENLY HIS HAND TOUCHED THE FAIRY WHISTLE AND HE FELL ASLEEP AT ONCE
5796-49593-0001 AND THE MOON WAS SO LOW IN THE SKY THAT ITS SLANTING LIGHT HAD CREPT UNDER THE OAK TREE HE SLIPPED DOWNSTAIRS SO LIGHTLY THAT HIS MASTER HEARD NOTHING AND THEN HE FOUND HIMSELF OUT IN THE BEAUTIFUL NIGHT WITH THE MOONLIGHT SO BRIGHT THAT IT WAS LIGHTER THAN DAYTIME
5796-49593-0002 AND THERE WAS ROBIN GOODFELLOW WAITING FOR HIM UNDER THE TREE HE WAS SO FINELY DRESSED THAT FOR A MOMENT FAIRYFOOT SCARCELY KNEW HIM

5796-49593-0041 JUST BEFORE THE SUN ROSE ROBIN GAVE HIM SOMETHING FROM ANOTHER FLAGON AND HE GREW LARGE AGAIN AND TWO MINUTES AND THREE SECONDS AND A HALF BEFORE DAYLIGHT THE BALL BROKE UP AND ROBIN TOOK HIM HOME AND LEFT HIM PROMISING TO CALL FOR HIM THE NEXT NIGHT
5796-49593-0042 EVERY NIGHT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SUMMER THE SAME THING HAPPENED AT MIDNIGHT HE WENT TO THE FAIRIES DANCE AND AT TWO MINUTES AND THREE SECONDS AND A HALF BEFORE DAWN HE CAME HOME
5796-49593-0043 AND BESIDES THAT ALL THE FAIRIES WERE HIS FRIENDS BUT WHEN THE SUMMER WAS COMING TO AN END ROBIN GOODFELLOW SAID TO HIM THIS IS OUR LAST DANCE AT LEAST IT WILL BE OUR LAST FOR SOME TIME
5796-49593-0044 AND GAUZITA GAVE HIM A TINY RING FOR A PARTING GIFT BUT THE NEXT NIGHT WHEN ROBIN DID NOT COME FOR HIM HE FELT VERY LONELY INDEED AND THE NEXT DAY HE WAS SO SORROWFUL THAT HE WANDERED FAR AWAY INTO THE FOREST
5796-49593-0045 IN THE HOPE OF FINDING SOMETHING TO CHEER HIM A LITTLE HE WANDERED SO FAR THAT HE BECAME VERY TIRED AND THIRSTY AND HE WAS JUST MAKING UP HIS MIND TO GO HOME WHEN HE THOUGHT HE HEARD THE SOUND OF FALLING WATER
5796-49593-0046 IT SEEMED TO COME FROM BEHIND A THICKET OF CLIMBING ROSES AND HE WENT TOWARDS THE PLACE AND PUSHED THE BRANCHES ASIDE A LITTLE SO THAT HE COULD LOOK THROUGH WHAT HE SAW WAS A GREAT SURPRISE TO HIM THOUGH IT WAS THE END OF SUMMER
5796-49593-0047 INSIDE THE THICKET THE ROSES WERE BLOOMING IN THOUSANDS ALL AROUND A POOL AS CLEAR AS CRYSTAL INTO WHICH THE SPARKLING WATER FELL FROM A HOLE IN THE ROCK ABOVE IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CLEAR POOL THAT FAIRYFOOT HAD EVER SEEN
5796-49593-0048 AND HE PRESSED HIS WAY THROUGH THE ROSE BRANCHES AND ENTERING THE CIRCLE THEY INCLOSED HE KNELT BY THE WATER AND DRANK ALMOST INSTANTLY HIS FEELING OF SADNESS LEFT HIM AND HE FELT QUITE HAPPY AND REFRESHED
5796-49593-0049 HE STRETCHED HIMSELF ON THE THICK PERFUMED MOSS AND LISTENED TO THE TINKLING OF THE WATER AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE FELL ASLEEP WHEN HE AWAKENED THE MOON WAS SHINING THE POOL SPARKLED LIKE A SILVER PLAQUE CRUSTED WITH DIAMONDS
5796-49593-0050 AND TWO NIGHTINGALES WERE SINGING IN THE BRANCHES OVER HIS HEAD AND THE NEXT MOMENT HE FOUND OUT THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THEIR LANGUAGE JUST AS PLAINLY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN HUMAN BEINGS INSTEAD OF BIRDS
5796-49593-0051 THE WATER WITH WHICH HE HAD QUENCHED HIS THIRST WAS ENCHANTED AND HAD GIVEN HIM THIS NEW POWER POOR BOY SAID ONE NIGHTINGALE HE LOOKS TIRED I WONDER WHERE HE CAME FROM WHY MY DEAR SAID THE OTHER
