3020-892-0000 SO THAT WHEN HE SPOKE OF HER AS BEING THE PERSON HE CARED MOST FOR IN THE WORLD SHE NATURALLY THOUGHT THAT HE MEANT TO EXCEPT LEONORA AND SHE WAS JUST GLAD IT WAS LIKE A FATHER SAYING THAT HE APPROVED OF A MARRIAGEABLE DAUGHTER
3020-892-0001 AND EDWARD WHEN HE REALIZED WHAT HE WAS DOING CURBED HIS TONGUE AT ONCE SHE WAS JUST GLAD AND SHE WENT ON BEING JUST GLAD
3020-892-0002 EVER DID IN HIS LIFE AND YET I AM SO NEAR TO ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT I CANNOT THINK ANY OF THEM WICKED
3020-892-0003 AS ANYTHING BUT STRAIGHT UPRIGHT AND HONOURABLE THAT I MEAN IS IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING MY PERMANENT VIEW OF HIM I TRY AT TIMES BY DWELLING ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HE DID TO PUSH THAT IMAGE OF HIM AWAY
3020-892-0004 AS YOU MIGHT TRY TO PUSH ASIDE A LARGE PENDULUM BUT IT ALWAYS COMES BACK THE MEMORY OF HIS INNUMERABLE ACTS OF KINDNESS OF HIS EFFICIENCY OF HIS UNSPITEFUL TONGUE HE WAS SUCH A FINE FELLOW
3020-892-0005 SO I FEEL MYSELF FORCED TO ATTEMPT TO EXCUSE HIM IN THIS AS IN SO MANY OTHER THINGS IT IS I HAVE NO DOUBT A MOST MONSTROUS THING TO ATTEMPT TO CORRUPT A YOUNG GIRL JUST OUT OF A CONVENT
3020-892-0006 BUT I THINK EDWARD HAD NO IDEA AT ALL OF CORRUPTING HER I BELIEVE THAT HE SIMPLY LOVED HER HE SAID THAT THAT WAS THE WAY OF IT AND I AT LEAST BELIEVE HIM AND I BELIEVE TOO THAT SHE WAS THE ONLY WOMAN HE EVER REALLY LOVED
3020-892-0007 HE SAID THAT THAT WAS SO AND HE DID ENOUGH TO PROVE IT AND LEONORA SAID THAT IT WAS SO AND LEONORA KNEW HIM TO THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART I HAVE COME TO BE VERY MUCH OF A CYNIC IN THESE MATTERS I MEAN
3020-892-0008 THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE IN THE PERMANENCE OF MAN'S OR WOMAN'S LOVE OR AT ANY RATE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE IN THE PERMANENCE OF ANY EARLY PASSION AS I SEE IT AT LEAST WITH REGARD TO MAN A LOVE AFFAIR
3020-892-0009 A LOVE FOR ANY DEFINITE WOMAN IS SOMETHING IN THE NATURE OF A WIDENING OF THE EXPERIENCE WITH EACH NEW WOMAN THAT A MAN IS ATTRACTED TO THERE APPEARS TO COME A BROADENING OF THE OUTLOOK OR IF YOU LIKE AN ACQUIRING OF NEW TERRITORY
3020-892-0010 ALL THESE THINGS AND IT IS THESE THINGS THAT CAUSE TO ARISE THE PASSION OF LOVE ALL THESE THINGS ARE LIKE SO MANY OBJECTS ON THE HORIZON OF THE LANDSCAPE THAT TEMPT A MAN TO WALK BEYOND THE HORIZON TO EXPLORE
3020-892-0011 BEHIND THOSE EYEBROWS WITH THE PECULIAR TURN AS IF HE DESIRED TO SEE THE WORLD WITH THE EYES THAT THEY OVERSHADOW HE WANTS TO HEAR THAT VOICE APPLYING ITSELF TO EVERY POSSIBLE PROPOSITION TO
3020-892-0012 EVERY POSSIBLE TOPIC HE WANTS TO SEE THOSE CHARACTERISTIC GESTURES AGAINST EVERY POSSIBLE BACKGROUND OF THE QUESTION OF THE SEX INSTINCT I KNOW VERY LITTLE AND I DO NOT THINK THAT IT COUNTS FOR VERY MUCH IN A REALLY GREAT PASSION
3020-892-0013 IT CAN BE AROUSED BY SUCH NOTHINGS BY AN UNTIED SHOELACE BY A GLANCE OF THE EYE IN PASSING THAT I THINK IT MIGHT BE LEFT OUT OF THE CALCULATION I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT ANY GREAT PASSION
3020-892-0014 COMMONPLACE AND TO BE THEREFORE A MATTER NEEDING NO COMMENT AT ALL IT IS A THING WITH ALL ITS ACCIDENTS THAT MUST BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED AS IN A NOVEL OR A BIOGRAPHY
3020-892-0015 YOU TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE CHARACTERS HAVE THEIR MEALS WITH SOME REGULARITY BUT THE REAL
3020-892-0016 LONG CONTINUED AND WITHERING UP
3020-892-0017 IS THE CRAVING FOR IDENTITY WITH THE WOMAN THAT HE LOVES HE DESIRES TO SEE WITH THE SAME EYES TO TOUCH WITH THE SAME SENSE OF TOUCH TO HEAR WITH THE SAME EARS TO LOSE HIS IDENTITY TO BE ENVELOPED
3020-892-0018 TO BE SUPPORTED FOR WHATEVER MAY BE SAID OF THE RELATION OF THE SEXES THERE IS NO MAN WHO LOVES A WOMAN THAT DOES NOT DESIRE TO COME TO HER FOR THE RENEWAL OF HIS COURAGE FOR THE CUTTING ASUNDER OF HIS DIFFICULTIES
3020-892-0019 AND THAT WILL BE THE MAINSPRING OF HIS DESIRE FOR HER WE ARE ALL SO AFRAID WE ARE ALL SO ALONE
3020-892-0020 SO FOR A TIME
3020-892-0021 THE MAN WILL GET WHAT HE WANTS HE WILL GET THE MORAL SUPPORT THE ENCOURAGEMENT THE RELIEF FROM THE SENSE OF LONELINESS
3020-892-0022 INEVITABLY THEY PASS AWAY AS THE SHADOWS PASS ACROSS SUNDIALS IT IS SAD BUT IT IS SO THE PAGES OF THE BOOK WILL BECOME FAMILIAR THE BEAUTIFUL CORNER OF THE ROAD WILL HAVE BEEN TURNED TOO MANY TIMES
3020-892-0023 THIS IS THE SADDEST STORY AND YET I DO BELIEVE THAT FOR EVERY MAN THERE COMES AT LAST A WOMAN
3020-892-0024 WHEN THE WOMAN WHO THEN SETS HER SEAL UPON HIS IMAGINATION HAS SET HER SEAL FOR GOOD HE WILL TRAVEL OVER NO MORE HORIZONS HE WILL NEVER AGAIN SET THE KNAPSACK OVER HIS SHOULDERS HE WILL RETIRE FROM THOSE SCENES
3020-892-0025 HE WILL HAVE GONE OUT OF THE BUSINESS THAT AT ANY RATE WAS THE CASE WITH EDWARD AND THE POOR GIRL IT WAS QUITE LITERALLY THE CASE IT WAS QUITE LITERALLY THE CASE THAT HIS PASSIONS FOR THE MISTRESS OF THE GRAND DUKE
3020-892-0026 FOR LITTLE MISSUS MAIDAN FOR FLORENCE FOR WHOM YOU WILL THESE PASSIONS WERE MERELY PRELIMINARY CANTERS COMPARED TO HIS FINAL RACE WITH DEATH FOR HER
3020-892-0027 I AM CERTAIN OF THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE SO AMERICAN AS TO SAY THAT ALL TRUE LOVE
3020-892-0028 BUT I THINK THAT LOVE WILL BE TRUER AND MORE PERMANENT IN WHICH SELF SACRIFICE HAS BEEN EXACTED AND IN THE CASE OF THE OTHER WOMEN EDWARD JUST CUT IN AND CUT THEM OUT AS HE DID WITH THE POLO BALL FROM UNDER THE NOSE OF COUNT BARON VON LELOEFFEL
3020-892-0029 IN THE ENDEAVOUR TO CAPTURE THE OTHER WOMEN BUT OVER HER HE WORE HIMSELF TO RAGS AND TATTERS AND DEATH IN THE EFFORT TO LEAVE HER ALONE AND IN SPEAKING TO HER ON THAT NIGHT HE WASN'T
3020-892-0030 I AM CONVINCED COMMITTING A BASENESS IT WAS AS IF HIS PASSION FOR HER HADN'T EXISTED AS IF THE VERY WORDS THAT HE SPOKE WITHOUT KNOWING THAT HE SPOKE THEM CREATED THE PASSION AS THEY WENT ALONG BEFORE HE SPOKE
3020-892-0031 THERE WAS NOTHING AFTERWARDS IT WAS THE INTEGRAL FACT OF HIS LIFE
3020-892-0032 AND MY STORY WAS CONCERNING ITSELF WITH FLORENCE WITH FLORENCE WHO HEARD THOSE WORDS FROM BEHIND THE TREE THAT OF COURSE IS ONLY CONJECTURE BUT I THINK THE CONJECTURE IS PRETTY WELL JUSTIFIED YOU HAVE THE FACT THAT THOSE TWO WENT OUT
3020-892-0033 HER FACE WAS CONTORTED WITH AGONY BEFORE EVER HER EYES FELL UPON ME OR UPON HIM BESIDE ME BUT I DARE SAY BAGSHAWE MAY HAVE BEEN THE DETERMINING INFLUENCE IN HER SUICIDE
3020-892-0034 LEONORA SAYS THAT SHE HAD THAT FLASK APPARENTLY OF NITRATE OF AMYL BUT ACTUALLY OF PRUSSIC ACID FOR MANY YEARS AND THAT SHE WAS DETERMINED TO USE IT IF EVER I DISCOVERED THE NATURE OF HER RELATIONSHIP
3020-892-0035 WITH THAT FELLOW JIMMY YOU SEE THE MAINSPRING OF HER NATURE MUST HAVE BEEN VANITY
3020-892-0036 THAT MAKES MOST OF US KEEP STRAIGHT IF WE DO KEEP STRAIGHT IN THIS WORLD
3020-892-0037 SHE WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE MADE HIM SCENES HAVE THREATENED HIM HAVE APPEALED TO HIS SENSE OF HUMOUR TO HIS PROMISES BUT MISTER BAGSHAWE AND THE FACT THAT THE DATE WAS THE FOURTH OF AUGUST MUST HAVE BEEN TOO MUCH FOR HER SUPERSTITIOUS MIND
3020-892-0038 YOU SEE SHE HAD TWO THINGS THAT SHE WANTED SHE WANTED TO BE A GREAT LADY INSTALLED IN BRANSHAW TELERAGH SHE WANTED ALSO TO RETAIN MY RESPECT
3020-892-0039 ASHBURNHAM TO BOLT WITH HER SHE WOULD HAVE LET THE WHOLE THING GO WITH A RUN OR PERHAPS SHE WOULD HAVE TRIED TO EXACT FROM ME A NEW RESPECT FOR THE GREATNESS OF HER PASSION ON THE LINES OF ALL FOR LOVE AND THE WORLD WELL LOST
3020-892-0040 IN ALL MATRIMONIAL ASSOCIATIONS THERE IS I BELIEVE ONE CONSTANT FACTOR A DESIRE TO DECEIVE THE PERSON WITH WHOM ONE LIVES AS TO SOME WEAK SPOT IN ONE'S CHARACTER OR IN ONE'S CAREER
3020-892-0041 FOR IT IS INTOLERABLE TO LIVE CONSTANTLY WITH ONE HUMAN BEING WHO PERCEIVES ONE'S SMALL MEANNESSES IT IS REALLY DEATH TO DO SO THAT IS WHY SO MANY MARRIAGES TURN OUT UNHAPPILY
3020-892-0042 I FOR INSTANCE AM A RATHER GREEDY MAN I HAVE A TASTE FOR GOOD COOKERY AND A WATERING TOOTH AT THE MERE SOUND OF THE NAMES OF CERTAIN COMESTIBLES IF FLORENCE HAD DISCOVERED THIS SECRET OF MINE
3020-892-0043 THAT SHE EXTRACTED FROM ME I AM BOUND TO SAY THAT FLORENCE NEVER DISCOVERED THIS SECRET CERTAINLY SHE NEVER ALLUDED TO IT I DARE SAY SHE NEVER TOOK SUFFICIENT INTEREST IN ME AND THE SECRET WEAKNESS OF FLORENCE
3020-892-0044 THE WEAKNESS THAT SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE ME DISCOVER WAS JUST THAT EARLY ESCAPADE WITH THE FELLOW CALLED JIMMY LET ME AS THIS IS IN ALL PROBABILITY THE LAST TIME I SHALL MENTION FLORENCE'S NAME
3020-892-0045 DWELL A LITTLE UPON THE CHANGE THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN HER PSYCHOLOGY SHE WOULD NOT I MEAN HAVE MINDED IF I HAD DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS THE MISTRESS OF EDWARD ASHBURNHAM
3020-892-0046 SHE WOULD RATHER HAVE LIKED IT INDEED THE CHIEF TROUBLE OF POOR LEONORA IN THOSE DAYS WAS TO KEEP FLORENCE FROM MAKING BEFORE ME THEATRICAL DISPLAYS ON ONE LINE OR ANOTHER
3020-892-0047 OF THAT VERY FACT SHE WANTED IN ONE MOOD TO COME RUSHING TO ME TO CAST HERSELF ON HER KNEES AT MY FEET AND TO DECLAIM A CAREFULLY ARRANGED FRIGHTFULLY EMOTIONAL OUTPOURING AS TO HER PASSION
3020-892-0048 THAT WAS TO SHOW THAT SHE WAS LIKE ONE OF THE GREAT EROTIC WOMEN OF WHOM HISTORY TELLS US IN ANOTHER MOOD SHE WOULD DESIRE TO COME TO ME DISDAINFULLY AND TO TELL ME THAT I WAS CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN A MAN
3020-892-0049 AND THAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS WHAT MUST HAPPEN WHEN A REAL MALE CAME ALONG SHE WANTED TO SAY THAT IN COOL BALANCED AND SARCASTIC SENTENCES THAT WAS WHEN SHE WISHED TO APPEAR LIKE THE HEROINE OF A FRENCH COMEDY
3020-892-0050 BECAUSE OF COURSE SHE WAS ALWAYS PLAY ACTING BUT WHAT SHE DIDN'T WANT ME TO KNOW WAS THE FACT OF HER FIRST ESCAPADE WITH THE FELLOW CALLED JIMMY SHE HAD ARRIVED AT FIGURING OUT THE SORT OF LOW DOWN BOWERY TOUGH
3020-892-0051 FOR SOME SMALL STUPID ACTION USUALLY FOR SOME SMALL QUITE GENUINE PIECE OF EMOTIONALISM OF YOUR EARLY LIFE WELL IT WAS THAT SORT OF SHUDDERING THAT CAME OVER FLORENCE AT THE THOUGHT
3020-892-0052 THAT SHE HAD SURRENDERED TO SUCH A LOW FELLOW
3020-892-0053 IT WAS HER FOOTLING OLD UNCLE'S WORK HE OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE TAKEN THOSE TWO ROUND THE WORLD TOGETHER AND SHUT HIMSELF UP IN HIS CABIN FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE TIME ANYHOW I AM CONVINCED THAT THE SIGHT OF MISTER BAGSHAWE
3020-892-0054 AND THE THOUGHT THAT MISTER BAGSHAWE FOR SHE KNEW THAT UNPLEASANT AND TOADLIKE PERSONALITY THE THOUGHT THAT MISTER BAGSHAWE
3020-892-0055 WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY REVEAL TO ME THAT HE HAD CAUGHT HER COMING OUT OF JIMMY'S BEDROOM AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING ON THE FOURTH OF AUGUST NINETEEN HUNDRED
3020-892-0056 THAT WAS THE DETERMINING INFLUENCE IN HER SUICIDE AND NO DOUBT THE EFFECT OF THE DATE WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER SUPERSTITIOUS PERSONALITY SHE HAD BEEN BORN ON THE FOURTH OF AUGUST SHE HAD STARTED TO GO ROUND THE WORLD ON THE FOURTH OF AUGUST
3020-892-0057 SHE HAD BECOME A LOW FELLOW'S MISTRESS ON THE FOURTH OF AUGUST ON THE SAME DAY OF THE YEAR SHE HAD MARRIED ME ON THAT FOURTH SHE HAD LOST EDWARD'S LOVE AND BAGSHAWE HAD APPEARED LIKE A SINISTER OMEN
3020-892-0058 LIKE A GRIN ON THE FACE OF FATE IT WAS THE LAST STRAW SHE RAN UPSTAIRS ARRANGED HERSELF DECORATIVELY UPON HER BED SHE WAS A SWEETLY PRETTY WOMAN WITH SMOOTH
3020-892-0059 PINK AND WHITE CHEEKS LONG HAIR THE EYELASHES FALLING LIKE A TINY CURTAIN ON HER CHEEKS
3020-892-0060 OH EXTREMELY CHARMING AND CLEAR CUT LOOKING WITH A PUZZLED EXPRESSION AT THE ELECTRIC LIGHT BULB THAT HUNG FROM THE CEILING OR PERHAPS THROUGH IT TO THE STARS ABOVE WHO KNOWS ANYHOW
3020-892-0061 THERE WAS AN END OF FLORENCE YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW QUITE EXTRAORDINARILY FOR ME THAT WAS THE END OF FLORENCE
3020-892-0062 WHEN IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO TALK ABOUT HER TO LEONORA OR WHEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF THESE WRITINGS I HAVE TRIED TO FIGURE HER OUT I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT HER AS I MIGHT DO ABOUT A PROBLEM IN ALGEBRA
3020-892-0063 BUT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN AS A MATTER FOR STUDY NOT FOR REMEMBRANCE SHE JUST WENT COMPLETELY OUT OF EXISTENCE LIKE YESTERDAY'S PAPER I WAS SO DEADLY TIRED AND I DARE SAY
3020-892-0064 OF WHAT WAS PRACTICALLY CATALEPSY WAS JUST THE REPOSE THAT MY EXHAUSTED NATURE CLAIMED AFTER TWELVE YEARS OF THE REPRESSION OF MY INSTINCTS AFTER TWELVE YEARS OF PLAYING THE TRAINED POODLE
3020-892-0065 FOR THAT WAS ALL THAT I HAD BEEN I SUPPOSE THAT IT WAS THE SHOCK THAT DID IT THE SEVERAL SHOCKS
3020-892-0066 IT WAS AS IF AN IMMENSELY HEAVY AN UNBEARABLY HEAVY KNAPSACK SUPPORTED UPON MY SHOULDERS BY STRAPS HAD FALLEN OFF AND LEFT MY SHOULDERS THEMSELVES THAT THE STRAPS HAD CUT INTO NUMB AND WITHOUT SENSATION OF LIFE
3020-892-0067 WHAT HAD I TO REGRET I SUPPOSE THAT MY INNER SOUL MY DUAL PERSONALITY HAD REALIZED LONG BEFORE THAT FLORENCE WAS A PERSONALITY OF PAPER THAT SHE REPRESENTED A REAL HUMAN BEING WITH A HEART
3020-892-0068 WITH FEELINGS WITH SYMPATHIES AND WITH EMOTIONS ONLY AS A BANK NOTE REPRESENTS A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF GOLD I KNOW THAT SORT OF FEELING CAME TO THE SURFACE IN ME THE MOMENT THE MAN BAGSHAWE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD SEEN HER COMING OUT OF THAT FELLOW'S BEDROOM
3020-892-0069 IT IS EVEN POSSIBLE THAT IF THAT FEELING HAD NOT POSSESSED ME I SHOULD HAVE RUN UP SOONER TO HER ROOM AND MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED HER DRINKING THE PRUSSIC ACID BUT I JUST COULDN'T DO IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE
3020-892-0070 CHASING A SCRAP OF PAPER AN OCCUPATION IGNOBLE FOR A GROWN MAN
3020-892-0071 DIDN'T INTEREST ME FLORENCE DIDN'T MATTER I SUPPOSE YOU WILL RETORT THAT I WAS IN LOVE WITH NANCY RUFFORD
3020-892-0072 I AM NOT SEEKING TO AVOID DISCREDIT I WAS IN LOVE WITH NANCY RUFFORD AS I AM IN LOVE WITH THE POOR CHILD'S MEMORY QUIETLY AND QUITE TENDERLY IN MY AMERICAN SORT OF WAY
3020-892-0073 I HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I HEARD LEONORA STATE THAT I MIGHT NOW MARRY HER BUT FROM THAT MOMENT UNTIL HER WORSE THAN DEATH I DO NOT SUPPOSE
3020-892-0074 THAT I MUCH THOUGHT ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT I SIGHED ABOUT HER OR GROANED I JUST WANTED TO MARRY HER
3020-892-0075 THE SORT OF FEELING THAT YOU MUST GET CERTAIN MATTERS OUT OF THE WAY SMOOTH OUT CERTAIN FAIRLY NEGLIGIBLE COMPLICATIONS BEFORE YOU CAN GO TO A PLACE THAT HAS DURING ALL YOUR LIFE
3020-892-0076 I DIDN'T ATTACH MUCH IMPORTANCE TO MY SUPERIOR YEARS I WAS FORTY FIVE AND SHE POOR THING WAS ONLY JUST RISING TWENTY TWO BUT SHE WAS OLDER THAN HER YEARS AND QUIETER SHE SEEMED TO HAVE AN ODD QUALITY OF SAINTHOOD
3020-892-0077 BUT SHE HAD FREQUENTLY TOLD ME THAT SHE HAD NO VOCATION IT JUST SIMPLY WASN'T THERE THE DESIRE TO BECOME A NUN WELL I GUESS THAT I WAS A SORT OF
3020-892-0078 OR IF HE EVER COMES TO DO SO THAT IS THE END OF HIM BUT AS SOON AS I CAME OUT OF MY CATALEPSY I SEEMED TO PERCEIVE
3020-892-0079 THAT MY PROBLEM THAT WHAT I HAD TO DO TO PREPARE MYSELF FOR GETTING INTO CONTACT WITH HER WAS JUST TO GET BACK INTO CONTACT WITH LIFE I HAD BEEN KEPT
3020-892-0080 WHAT I THEN HAD TO DO WAS A LITTLE FIGHTING WITH REAL LIFE SOME WRESTLING WITH MEN OF BUSINESS SOME TRAVELLING AMONGST LARGER CITIES SOMETHING HARSH SOMETHING MASCULINE I DIDN'T WANT TO PRESENT MYSELF TO NANCY RUFFORD AS A SORT OF AN OLD MAID
