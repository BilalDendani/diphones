1579-128131-0000 BUT THAT OTHERWISE POETRY IS AN ADMIRABLE THING THIS HOWEVER SEEMS TO US A SOMEWHAT HARSH VIEW OF THE SUBJECT LITTLE POETS ARE AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING STUDY
1579-128131-0001 THE BEST OF THEM HAVE OFTEN SOME NEW BEAUTY TO SHOW US AND THOUGH THE WORST OF THEM MAY BORE YET THEY RARELY BRUTALISE POOR FOLKS LIVES FOR INSTANCE
1579-128131-0002 IS A VOLUME THAT COULD DO NO POSSIBLE HARM TO ANY ONE THESE POEMS DISPLAY A HEALTHY ROLLICKING G R SIMS TONE OF FEELING AN ALMOST UNBOUNDED REGARD FOR THE CONVERTED DRUNKARD
1579-128131-0003 AND A STRONG SYMPATHY WITH THE SUFFERINGS OF THE POOR AS FOR THEIR THEOLOGY IT IS OF THAT HONEST DOWNRIGHT AND POPULAR KIND WHICH IN THESE RATIONALISTIC DAYS IS PROBABLY QUITE AS USEFUL
1579-128131-0004 AS ANY OTHER FORM OF THEOLOGICAL THOUGHT HERE IS THE OPENING OF A POEM CALLED A STREET SERMON WHICH IS AN INTERESTING EXAMPLE OF WHAT MUSCULAR CHRISTIANITY CAN DO IN THE SPHERE OF VERSE MAKING WHAT
1579-128131-0005 GOD FIGHT SHY OF THE CITY HE'S T OTHER SIDE UP I GUESS IF YOU EVER WANT TO FIND HIM WHITECHAPEL'S THE RIGHT ADDRESS THOSE WHO PREFER PSEUDO POETICAL PROSE TO REALLY PROSAIC POETRY
1579-128131-0006 PICTURES IN THE FIRE INTO LEADERS FOR THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AS FROM THE LITERARY POINT OF VIEW THEY HAVE ALL THE QUALITIES DEAR TO THE ASIATIC SCHOOL WHAT A SPLENDID LEADER THE YOUNG LIONS OF FLEET STREET
1579-128131-0007 WOULD HAVE MADE OUT OF THE PRESTIGE OF ENGLAND FOR INSTANCE A POEM SUGGESTED BY THE OPENING OF THE ZULU WAR IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE NOW AWAY SAIL OUR SHIPS FAR AWAY O'ER THE SEA
1579-128131-0008 FAR AWAY WITH OUR GALLANT AND BRAVE THE LOUD WAR CRY IS SOUNDING LIKE WILD REVELRIE AND OUR HEROES DASH ON TO THEIR GRAVE FOR THE FIERCE ZULU TRIBES HAVE ARISEN IN THEIR MIGHT
1579-128131-0009 AND IN THOUSANDS SWEPT DOWN ON OUR FEW BUT THESE BRAVES ONLY YIELDED WHEN CRUSHED IN THE FIGHT MAN TO MAN TO THEIR COLOURS WERE TRUE
1579-128131-0010 THE CONCEPTION OF THE WAR CRY SOUNDING LIKE WILD REVELRIE IS QUITE IN THE TRUE ASIATIC SPIRIT
1579-128131-0011 THE FAIRIES FOR INSTANCE IS A VERY PRETTY POEM AND REMINDS US OF SOME OF DICKY DOYLE'S CHARMING DRAWINGS AND NAT BENTLEY IS A CAPITAL BALLAD IN ITS WAY THE IRISH POEMS HOWEVER
1579-128131-0012 ARE RATHER VULGAR AND SHOULD BE EXPUNGED THE CELTIC ELEMENT IN LITERATURE IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE BUT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE FOR SHRIEKING SHILLELAGH AND O GORRAH WOMEN MUST WEEP
1579-128131-0013 BY PROFESSOR HARALD WILLIAMS HAS THE MOST DREADFUL COVER OF ANY BOOK THAT WE HAVE COME ACROSS FOR SOME TIME PAST IT IS POSSIBLY INTENDED TO SYMBOLISE THE SORROW OF THE WORLD BUT IT MERELY SUGGESTS THE DECORATIVE TENDENCIES OF AN UNDERTAKER
1579-128131-0014 AND IS AS DEPRESSING AS IT IS DETESTABLE HOWEVER AS THE COWL DOES NOT MAKE THE MONK SO THE BINDING IN THE CASE OF THE SAVILE CLUB SCHOOL DOES NOT MAKE THE POET AND WE OPEN THE VOLUME WITHOUT PREJUDICE
1579-128131-0015 THE FIRST POEM THAT WE COME TO IS A VIGOROUS ATTACK ON THOSE WICKED AND MISGUIDED PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT BEAUTY IS ITS OWN REASON FOR EXISTING AND THAT ART SHOULD HAVE NO OTHER AIM BUT HER OWN PERFECTION
1579-128131-0016 HERE ARE SOME OF THE PROFESSOR'S GRAVEST ACCUSATIONS WHY DO THEY PATCH IN THEIR FATAL CHOICE WHEN AT SECRETS SUCH THE ANGELS QUAKE BUT A PLAY OF THE VISION AND THE VOICE
1579-128131-0017 OH IT'S ALL FOR ART'S SAKE WHY DO THEY GATHER WHAT SHOULD BE LEFT AND LEAVE BEHIND WHAT THEY OUGHT TO TAKE AND EXULT IN THE BASEST BLANK OR THEFT OH IT'S ALL FOR ART'S SAKE
1579-128131-0018 IT CERTAINLY MUST BE ADMITTED THAT TO PATCH OR TO EXULT IN THE BASEST BLANK IS A FORM OF CONDUCT QUITE UNBEFITTING AN ARTIST THE VERY OBSCURITY AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE CHARACTER OF SUCH A CRIME
1579-128131-0019 ADDING SOMETHING TO ITS HORROR HOWEVER WHILE FULLY RECOGNISING THE WICKEDNESS OF PATCHING WE CANNOT BUT THINK THAT PROFESSOR HARALD WILLIAMS
1579-128131-0020 IS HAPPIER IN HIS CRITICISM OF LIFE THAN HE IS IN HIS ART CRITICISM HIS POEM BETWEEN THE BANKS FOR INSTANCE HAS A TOUCH OF SINCERITY AND FINE FEELING THAT ALMOST ATONES FOR ITS OVER EMPHASIS
1579-128131-0021 JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN BEARS NO RESEMBLANCE TO THAT STRANGE PLAY ON THE SAME SUBJECT WHICH MISTER SWINBURNE SO MUCH ADMIRES INDEED IT MAY BE SAID TO POSSESS ALL THE FATAL ORIGINALITY OF INEXPERIENCE HOWEVER
1579-128131-0022 AS TO THE DIALOGUE HE SAYS I HAVE PUT THE LANGUAGE OF REAL LIFE INTO THE MOUTHS OF THE SPEAKERS EXCEPT WHEN THEY MAY BE SUPPOSED TO BE UNDER STRONG EMOTION THEN THEIR UTTERANCES BECOME MORE RAPID
1579-128131-0023 BROKEN FIGURATIVE IN SHORT MORE POETICAL WELL HERE IS THE SPEECH OF POTIPHAR'S WIFE UNDER STRONG EMOTION
1579-128131-0024 SEIZING HIM LOVE ME OR DEATH HA DOST THOU THINK THOU WILT NOT AND YET LIVE BY ISIS NO AND THOU WILT TURN AWAY IRON MARBLE MOCKMAN AH I HOLD THY LIFE
1579-128131-0025 LOVE FEEDS ON DEATH IT SWALLOWS UP ALL LIFE HUGGING OR KILLING I TO WOO AND THOU UNHAPPY ME OH THE LANGUAGE HERE IS CERTAINLY RAPID AND BROKEN
1579-128131-0026 AND THE EXPRESSION MARBLE MOCKMAN IS WE SUPPOSE FIGURATIVE BUT THE PASSAGE CAN SCARCELY BE DESCRIBED AS POETICAL THOUGH IT FULFILS ALL MISTER BUCHAN'S CONDITIONS STILL
1579-128131-0027 TEDIOUS AS ZULEEKHA AND JOSEPH ARE THE CHORUS OF ANCIENTS IS MUCH WORSE THESE IDEAL SPECTATORS SEEM TO SPEND THEIR LIVES IN UTTERING THOSE SOLEMN PLATITUDES THAT WITH THE AGED PASS FOR WISDOM
1579-128131-0028 WHO HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO HESITATION IN INTERRUPTING THE PROGRESS OF THE PLAY WITH OBSERVATIONS OF THIS KIND
1579-128131-0029 AH BUT FAVOUR EXTREME SHOWN TO ONE AMONG EQUALS WHO YET STAND APART
1579-128131-0030 THE DEMONS JEALOUSY ENVY HATE IN THE BREAST OF THOSE PASSED BY IT IS A CURIOUS THING THAT WHEN MINOR POETS WRITE CHORUSES TO A PLAY THEY SHOULD ALWAYS CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO ADOPT THE STYLE
1579-128131-0031 AND LANGUAGE OF A BAD TRANSLATOR WE FEAR THAT MISTER BOHN HAS MUCH TO ANSWER FOR GOD'S GARDEN IS A WELL MEANING ATTEMPT TO USE NATURE FOR THEOLOGICAL AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES
1579-128131-0032 IT BELONGS TO THAT ANTIQUATED SCHOOL OF THOUGHT THAT IN SPITE OF THE DISCOVERIES OF MODERN SCIENCE INVITES THE SLUGGARD TO LOOK AT THE ANT AND THE IDLE TO IMITATE THE BEE IT IS FULL OF FALSE ANALOGIES
1579-128131-0033 AND THAT A FOND FATHER SHOULD LEARN FROM THE EXAMPLE OF THE CHESTNUT THAT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN OFTEN TURN OUT BADLY WE MUST ADMIT THAT WE HAVE NO SYMPATHY WITH THIS POINT OF VIEW AND WE STRONGLY PROTEST AGAINST THE IDEA THAT
1579-128131-0034 THE FLAMING POPPY WITH ITS BLACK CORE TELLS OF ANGER'S FLUSHING FACE AND HEART OF SIN THE WORST USE THAT MAN CAN MAKE OF NATURE IS TO TURN HER INTO A MIRROR FOR HIS OWN VICES
1579-128131-0035 NOR ARE NATURE'S SECRETS EVER DISCLOSED TO THOSE WHO APPROACH HER IN THIS SPIRIT HOWEVER THE AUTHOR OF THIS IRRITATING LITTLE VOLUME
1579-128131-0036 IS NOT ALWAYS BOTANISING AND MORALISING IN THIS RECKLESS AND IMPROPER FASHION HE HAS BETTER MOMENTS AND THOSE WHO SYMPATHISE WITH THE DUKE OF WESTMINSTER'S EFFORTS TO PROVIDE OPEN SPACES FOR THE PEOPLE
1579-128131-0037 WILL NO DOUBT JOIN IN THE ASPIRATION GOD BLESS WISE GROSVENORS WHOSE HEARTS INCLINE WORKMEN TO FETE AND GRATEFUL SOULS REFINE THOUGH THEY MAY REGRET THAT SO NOBLE A SENTIMENT
1579-128131-0038 IS EXPRESSED IN SO INADEQUATE A FORM IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY MISTER CYRUS THORNTON SHOULD HAVE CALLED HIS VOLUME VOICES OF THE STREET HOWEVER
1579-128131-0039 AND THE WISE OLD ROMAN BONDSMAN SAW NO TERROR IN THE DEAD CHILDREN WHEN THE PLAY WAS OVER GOING SOFTLY HOME TO BED HAVE A PLEASANT TENNYSONIAN RING
1579-128131-0040 THE BALLAD OF THE OLD YEAR IS RATHER DEPRESSING BURY THE OLD YEAR SOLEMNLY HAS BEEN SAID FAR TOO OFTEN AND THE SENTIMENT IS SUITABLE ONLY FOR CHRISTMAS CRACKERS THE BEST THING IN THE BOOK IS
1579-128131-0041 THE POET'S VISION OF DEATH WHICH IS QUITE ABOVE THE AVERAGE MISSUS DOBELL INFORMS US THAT SHE HAS ALREADY PUBLISHED SIXTEEN VOLUMES OF POETRY AND THAT SHE INTENDS TO PUBLISH TWO MORE
1579-128131-0042 BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TEN AND TWO O'CLOCK JUDGING FROM THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT WE CANNOT SAY THAT WE CONSIDER THIS A VERY FAVOURABLE TIME FOR INSPIRATION AT ANY RATE IN THE CASE OF MISSUS DOBELL
1579-128131-0043 WERE ANTHONY TROLLOPE AND GEORGE ELIOT ALIVE WHICH UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE NOT AS REGARDS THE SUBJECT OF QUACK SNUBBING YOU KNOW TO SUPPORT ME I AM SURE THEY HADN'T BEEN SLOW
1579-128131-0044 FOR THEY TOO HATED THE WRETCHED PARASITE THAT FATTENS ON THE FRESHEST THE MOST BRIGHT OF THE BLOSSOMS SPRINGING FROM THE PUBLIC PRESS AND THAT OFT ARE FLOWERS THAT EVEN OUR QUACKS SHOULD BLESS
