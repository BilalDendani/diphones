7938-110127-0004 I THINK THAT PERHAPS THIS WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF NAPLES BUT I DO NOT KNOW SHE ADDED GO AT ONCE AND FIND OUT ORDERED THE PRINCE YOU SHALL BE RICHLY REWARDED THE OLD WOMAN HASTENED TO THE ROYAL PALACE
7938-110127-0005 LOVELY LADY I WANT TO TALK TO YOU SHE CALLED OUT NOW IT HAPPENED THAT DAY THAT THE PRINCESS WAS FEELING DECIDEDLY BORED AND OUT OF TUNE WITH LIFE
7938-110127-0006 THUS IT CAME TO PASS THAT SHE OPENED THE WINDOW GRACIOUSLY
7938-110127-0007 SHE ASKED ARE YOU THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF NAPLES QUESTIONED THE OLD WOMAN I AM REPLIED THE PRINCESS MAY I COME SOME DAY TO SELL YOU PRETTY THINGS
7938-110127-0008 THE PRINCESS APPOINTED AN HOUR THE NEXT DAY WHEN SHE MIGHT COME WITH HER WARES THEN THE OLD WOMAN HURRIED BACK TO THE WAITING PRINCE
7938-110127-0009 HE WAS SO DELIGHTED THAT AT LAST HE HAD FOUND THIS OUT THAT HE COULD WELL AFFORD TO BE GENEROUS THE OLD WOMAN THANKED HIM I DID SOMETHING ELSE FOR YOU KIND SIR SHE SAID I MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE THE PRINCESS TO MORROW I AM GOING TO THE PALACE AT FOUR O'CLOCK TO SELL PRETTY THINGS TO HER
7938-110127-0010 WELL DONE GOOD MOTHER CRIED THE PRINCE AGAIN THRUSTING HIS HAND INTO HIS PURSE LET ME GO IN YOUR PLACE THE OLD WOMAN GLADLY CONSENTED AND THE PRINCE DRESSED HIMSELF AS A PEDDLER
7938-110127-0011 IT IS A PEDDLER WITH MANY INTERESTING WARES FOR SALE SAID THE SERVANT WHO ANSWERED HIS KNOCK HE SPEAKS OF AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS YES SAID THE PRINCESS A PEDDLER WAS TO COME TO DAY AT FOUR O'CLOCK WITH PRETTY THINGS FOR ME TO BUY
7938-110127-0012 WHAT LOVELY THINGS YOU HAVE SHE CRIED AS SHE EXAMINED THE TRAY FULL OF RIBBONS AND BEADS AND TRINKETS
7938-110127-0013 WHAT IS THE PRICE OF THESE THE PRINCE WOULD NOT SET A PRICE IF YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS IS PLEASED WITH THESE SAID HE I HAVE MANY MORE THINGS AT HOME WHICH YOU WILL LIKE EVEN BETTER I'LL BRING THEM TO YOU TO MORROW THAT WILL BE SPLENDID CRIED THE PRINCESS
7938-110127-0014 COME AGAIN TO MORROW AT THIS HOUR THE NEXT DAY THE PRINCE AGAIN DRESSED HIMSELF AS A PEDDLER BUT UNDERNEATH THE OUTER GARMENTS HE WORE HIS OWN RICH CLOTHING WHEN HE WAS ADMITTED TO THE ROYAL PALACE HE LAID ASIDE HIS PEDDLER'S DISGUISE AND STOOD BEFORE THE PRINCESS LOOKING LIKE THE TRUE PRINCE HE WAS
7938-110127-0015 HE WAS VERY HANDSOME IN HIS RICH SUIT OF CRIMSON VELVET WITH HIS HAT WITH THE LONG PLUME IN HIS HAND THE PRINCESS WAS SO SURPRISED THAT SHE TURNED PALE WHO ARE YOU SHE CRIED YOU SURELY ARE NOT THE PEDDLER WHO CAME HERE YESTERDAY
7938-110127-0016 THE PRINCE SMILED INTO HER EYES AND EVEN WITHOUT THE PEDDLER'S GARMENTS WHICH WERE ROLLED UP ON THE TRAY SHE WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED HIM HE TOLD HER OF THE QUEST WHICH HAD LED HIM THERE AND SHE ADMIRED ALL THE PATIENCE AND DILIGENCE HE HAD SHOWN IN FINDING OUT HER EXISTENCE
7938-110127-0017 WHEN HE ASKED HER TO MARRY HIM AT ONCE SHE READILY CONSENTED
7938-110127-0018 ALL THIS SOUNDED VERY ROMANTIC TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF NAPLES SHE HAD NEVER DREAMED THAT A THING LIKE THIS WOULD EVER HAPPEN
7938-110127-0019 I'LL GENTLY DEPOSIT HIM ON THE GROUND AND GET AWAY WITH HIS HORSE AND SADDLE THOUGHT THE THIEF AS HE STOPPED AND REGARDED THE HORSE WITH A CRITICAL EYE JUST THEN HOWEVER HE SAW SOMETHING WHICH MADE HIM CHANGE HIS MIND ABOUT HURRYING AWAY AFTER HE HAD DEPOSITED THE PRINCE'S SLEEPING FORM BENEATH A TREE
7938-110127-0020 THERE WAS THE LOVELIEST MAIDEN HE HAD EVER SEEN CREEPING SILENTLY DOWN THE STAIRWAY SHE CAME STRAIGHT UP TO HIM I'M READY BELOVED WERE HER WORDS THE ROBBER SILENTLY LIFTED HER BEHIND HIM ON THE HORSE'S BACK AND TOGETHER THEY RODE AWAY WHERE IS YOUR BOAT
7938-110127-0021 ASKED THE PRINCESS AFTER THEY HAD RIDDEN TOGETHER FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT SPEAKING SO IT IS A BOAT WHICH THE FAIR LADY IS LOOKING FOR THOUGHT THE THIEF I WAS EXPECTING THIS GOOD HORSE TO CARRY US THE WHOLE DISTANCE A BOAT IS A BIT DIFFICULT TO ARRANGE BUT IT CAN BE DONE IF NECESSARY
7938-110127-0022 THERE OUGHT TO BE A BOAT AROUND SOMEWHERE FOR ME TO STEAL
7938-110127-0023 WHEN HE RETURNED THE LIGHT SHONE UPON HIS FACE AND THE GIRL THOUGHT THAT HE DID NOT LOOK THE SAME AS THE DAY BEFORE OF COURSE I'VE SEEN HIM ONLY TWICE SHE TOLD HERSELF IN AN EFFORT TO GAIN ASSURANCE IT MUST BE THE PRINCE MY OWN TRUE LOVE HERE IS OUR BOAT
7938-110127-0024 SAID THE ROBBER AND TOGETHER THEY EMBARKED
7938-110127-0025 THE ROBBER LAUGHED DOES MY LADY KNOW WITH WHOM SHE IS GOING AWAY HE ASKED
7938-110127-0026 RUNNING AWAY WAS NOT HALF SO ROMANTIC AND DELIGHTFUL AS SHE HAD PICTURED IT SHE HEARTILY WISHED THAT SHE WERE BACK IN THE ROYAL PALACE AS FOR THE PRINCE HE SOON AWOKE AND LOOKED ABOUT THE PALACE GARDEN WHERE HE WAS LYING UNDER THE TREE HOW DID I GET HERE
7938-110127-0027 HE ASKED AS HE RUBBED HIS EYES SLEEPILY THERE WAS NONE TO TELL HIM SO HE DECIDED THAT HIS HORSE MUST HAVE THROWN HIM OFF AND RUN AWAY IT IS QUEER THAT MY FALL DID NOT AWAKEN ME HE SAID TO HIMSELF IT IS A BIT AWKWARD TO LOSE MY HORSE
7938-110127-0028 HOWEVER IF THE PRINCESS ONLY KEEPS HER PROMISE AND COMES TO ME WE SHALL MANAGE TO GET TO OUR SHIP SOMEHOW
7938-110127-0029 THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF NAPLES SOBBED AND CRIED SO LOUD WHEN SHE FOUND THAT IT WAS NOT HER OWN PRINCE WITH WHOM SHE WAS SAILING THAT THE ROBBER BECAME QUITE DISGUSTED WITH HER
7938-110127-0030 WITH HER FACE ALL RED AND SWOLLEN WITH MUCH WEEPING THE ROBBER DECIDED THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO BOTHER WITH HER ANY LONGER
7938-110127-0031 THE PRINCESS WANDERED ABOUT THE PLACE UNTIL NIGHT CAME WITHOUT SEEING A SINGLE SOUL NOTHING BUT THE SEA SKY AND ROCKS SHE WAS REALLY HOWEVER NOT FAR FROM THE HUT IN WHICH THERE LIVED THE WIFE AND DAUGHTER OF A POOR FISHERMAN
7938-110127-0032 IN THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT THEY HEARD A CRY SOME ONE IS IN TROUBLE OUTSIDE MOTHER SAID THE DAUGHTER PERHAPS THE PIRATES HAVE COME AND BY THIS CRY ARE TRYING TO LURE US OUT ANSWERED HER MOTHER CAUTIOUSLY THERE WERE OFTEN PIRATE SHIPS WHICH STOPPED THERE
7938-110127-0033 THE DAUGHTER LISTENED CAREFULLY NO MOTHER SHE INSISTED I'M SURE THIS IS A GIRL'S CRY THE TWO WOMEN OPENED THEIR DOOR AND CREPT OUT IN THE DARKNESS THE SOBS OF THE PRINCESS SOON LED THEM TO THE PLACE UPON THE ROCKS WHERE SHE LAY CRYING AS IF HER HEART WOULD BREAK
7938-110127-0034 NOW IT HAPPENED THAT THE PRINCE'S SHIP ENCOUNTERED A GREAT STORM AND WAS DRIVEN ABOUT BY THE SEA
7938-110127-0035 THE PRINCE SAW THE FISHERMAN'S DAUGHTER AND THE PRINCESS STANDING ON THE ROCKS BY THE SEA HE STARED HARD AT THE PRINCESS THEN HE SPOKE IN A VOICE WHICH SHOOK YOU REMIND ME OF SOME ONE I USED TO KNOW HE SAID TELL ME YOUR NAME I PRAY YOU FAIR MAID
7938-110127-0036 THE PRINCESS LOOKED DOWN AT THE GARMENTS OF THE FISHER MAID WHICH SHE WORE SHE BLUSHED THE PRINCE SHE HAD RECOGNIZED THE VERY MOMENT SHE HAD SEEN HIM
7938-110127-0037 WE FOUND HER UPON THESE VERY ROCKS
7938-110127-0038 SHE IS NO MORE THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF NAPLES THAN I AM
