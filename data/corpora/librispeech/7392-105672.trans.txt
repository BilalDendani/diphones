7392-105672-0002 THE CHIEF PROOF OF THEIR GUILT CONSISTED IN A HEARSAY FROM ONE LADY WINGFIELD WHO WAS DEAD SMETON WAS PREVAILED ON BY THE VAIN HOPES OF LIFE TO CONFESS A CRIMINAL CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE QUEEN
7392-105672-0003 BUT EVEN HER ENEMIES EXPECTED LITTLE ADVANTAGE FROM THIS CONFESSION FOR THEY NEVER DARED TO CONFRONT HIM WITH HER AND HE WAS IMMEDIATELY EXECUTED AS WERE ALSO BRERETON AND WESTON NORRIS HAD BEEN MUCH IN THE KING'S FAVOR
7392-105672-0004 AND AN OFFER OF LIFE WAS MADE HIM IF HE WOULD CONFESS HIS CRIME AND ACCUSE THE QUEEN BUT HE GENEROUSLY REJECTED THE PROPOSAL
7392-105672-0005 THE CHIEF EVIDENCE IT IS SAID AMOUNTED TO NO MORE THAN THAT ROCHEFORD HAD BEEN SEEN TO LEAN ON HER BED BEFORE SOME COMPANY PART OF THE CHARGE AGAINST HER WAS THAT SHE HAD AFFIRMED TO HER MINIONS THAT THE KING NEVER HAD HER HEART
7392-105672-0006 SUCH PALPABLE ABSURDITIES WERE AT THAT TIME ADMITTED AND THEY WERE REGARDED BY THE PEERS OF ENGLAND AS A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR SACRIFICING AN INNOCENT QUEEN TO THE CRUELTY OF THEIR TYRANT THOUGH UNASSISTED BY COUNSEL
7392-105672-0007 SHE DEFENDED HERSELF WITH PRESENCE OF MIND AND THE SPECTATORS COULD NOT FORBEAR PRONOUNCING HER ENTIRELY INNOCENT JUDGMENT HOWEVER WAS GIVEN BY THE COURT BOTH AGAINST THE QUEEN AND LORD ROCHEFORD
7392-105672-0008 THOU WHO ART THE WAY THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE THOU KNOWEST THAT I HAVE NOT DESERVED THIS FATE AND THEN TURNING TO THE JUDGES MADE THE MOST PATHETIC DECLARATIONS OF HER INNOCENCE HENRY NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS CRUEL VENGEANCE
7392-105672-0009 AND TO DECLARE HER ISSUE ILLEGITIMATE HE RECALLED TO HIS MEMORY THAT A LITTLE AFTER HER APPEARANCE IN THE ENGLISH COURT SOME ATTACHMENT HAD BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BETWEEN HER AND THE EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND
7392-105672-0010 AND HE NOW QUESTIONED THAT NOBLEMAN WITH REGARD TO THESE ENGAGEMENTS NORTHUMBERLAND TOOK AN OATH BEFORE THE TWO ARCHBISHOPS THAT NO CONTRACT OR PROMISE OF MARRIAGE HAD EVER PASSED BETWEEN THEM HE RECEIVED THE SACRAMENT UPON IT
7392-105672-0011 BEFORE THE DUKE OF NORFOLK AND OTHERS OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL AND THIS SOLEMN ACT HE ACCOMPANIED WITH THE MOST SOLEMN PROTESTATIONS OF VERACITY THE QUEEN HOWEVER
7392-105672-0012 WAS SHAKEN BY MENACES OF EXECUTING THE SENTENCE AGAINST HER IN ITS GREATEST RIGOR AND WAS PREVAILED ON TO CONFESS IN COURT SOME LAWFUL IMPEDIMENT TO HER MARRIAGE WITH THE KING THE AFFLICTED PRIMATE WHO SAT AS JUDGE
7392-105672-0013 THOUGHT HIMSELF OBLIGED BY THIS CONFESSION TO PRONOUNCE THE MARRIAGE NULL AND INVALID HENRY IN THE TRANSPORTS OF HIS FURY DID NOT PERCEIVE
7392-105672-0014 AND ACKNOWLEDGED THE OBLIGATIONS WHICH SHE OWED HIM IN THUS UNIFORMLY CONTINUING HIS ENDEAVORS FOR HER ADVANCEMENT FROM A PRIVATE GENTLEWOMAN SHE SAID HE HAD FIRST MADE HER A MARCHIONESS THEN A QUEEN AND NOW
7392-105672-0015 SINCE HE COULD RAISE HER NO HIGHER IN THIS WORLD HE WAS SENDING HER TO BE A SAINT IN HEAVEN SHE THEN RENEWED THE PROTESTATIONS OF HER INNOCENCE AND RECOMMENDED HER DAUGHTER TO HIS CARE BEFORE THE LIEUTENANT OF THE TOWER AND ALL WHO APPROACHED HER
7392-105672-0016 SHE MADE THE LIKE DECLARATIONS AND CONTINUED TO BEHAVE HERSELF WITH HER USUAL SERENITY AND EVEN WITH CHEERFULNESS THE EXECUTIONER SHE SAID TO THE LIEUTENANT IS I HEAR VERY EXPERT AND MY NECK IS VERY SLENDER UPON WHICH
7392-105672-0017 SHE GRASPED IT IN HER HAND AND SMILED WHEN BROUGHT HOWEVER TO THE SCAFFOLD SHE SOFTENED HER TONE A LITTLE WITH REGARD TO HER PROTESTATIONS OF INNOCENCE SHE PROBABLY REFLECTED
7392-105672-0018 WHICH THE UNJUST SENTENCE BY WHICH SHE SUFFERED NATURALLY EXCITED IN HER SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS COME TO DIE AS SHE WAS SENTENCED BY THE LAW
7392-105672-0019 SHE PRAYED HEARTILY FOR THE KING CALLED HIM A MOST MERCIFUL AND GENTLE PRINCE AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN TO HER A GOOD AND GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN AND IF ANY ONE SHOULD THINK PROPER TO CANVASS HER CAUSE
7392-105672-0020 SHE DESIRED HIM TO JUDGE THE BEST SHE WAS BEHEADED BY THE EXECUTIONER OF CALAIS
7392-105672-0021 KNEW NOT WHOM TO ACCUSE AS HER LOVER AND THOUGH HE IMPUTED GUILT TO HER BROTHER AND FOUR PERSONS MORE HE WAS ABLE TO BRING PROOF AGAINST NONE OF THEM THE WHOLE TENOR OF HER CONDUCT FORBIDS US TO ASCRIBE TO HER AN ABANDONED CHARACTER
7392-105672-0022 SUCH AS IS IMPLIED IN THE KING'S ACCUSATION
7392-105672-0023 BY MARRYING JANE SEYMOUR THE VERY DAY AFTER HER EXECUTION HIS IMPATIENCE TO GRATIFY THIS NEW PASSION CAUSED HIM TO FORGOT ALL REGARD TO DECENCY AND HIS CRUEL HEART WAS NOT SOFTENED A MOMENT BY THE BLOODY CATASTROPHE

7392-105672-0026 MADE A MERIT TO HIS PEOPLE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE MISFORTUNES ATTENDING HIS TWO FORMER MARRIAGES HE HAD BEEN INDUCED FOR THEIR GOOD TO VENTURE ON A THIRD THE SPEAKER RECEIVED THIS PROFESSION WITH SUITABLE GRATITUDE
7392-105672-0027 AND HE TOOK THENCE OCCASION TO PRAISE THE KING FOR HIS WONDERFUL GIFTS OF GRACE AND NATURE HE COMPARED HIM FOR JUSTICE AND PRUDENCE TO SOLOMON FOR STRENGTH AND FORTITUDE TO SAMSON AND FOR BEAUTY AND COMELINESS TO ABSALOM
7392-105672-0028 THE KING VERY HUMBLY REPLIED
7392-105672-0029 THAT HE DISAVOWED THESE PRAISES SINCE IF HE WERE REALLY POSSESSED OF SUCH ENDOWMENTS THEY WERE THE GIFT OF ALMIGHTY GOD ONLY HENRY FOUND THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS NO LESS SUBMISSIVE IN DEEDS THAN COMPLAISANT IN THEIR EXPRESSIONS
7392-105672-0030 AND THAT THEY WOULD GO THE SAME LENGTHS AS THE FORMER IN GRATIFYING EVEN HIS MOST LAWLESS PASSIONS HIS DIVORCE FROM ANNE BOLEYN WAS RATIFIED THAT QUEEN AND ALL HER ACCOMPLICES WERE ATTAINTED
