3588-180957-0000 AT LAST WE CAME TO A PLACE FROM WHICH THE GREAT SPREAD OF THE EARTH WAS VISIBLE FOR A TIME
3588-180957-0001 WE HAD WHOLLY LOST OURSELVES GOING UP AND DOWN AND TURNING CORNERS WITHOUT GETTING FURTHER BUT MY FATHER SAID THAT WE MUST COME RIGHT IF WE MADE UP OUR MINDS TO GO LONG ENOUGH
3588-180957-0002 WE HAD BEEN IN AMONG ALL SHAPES AND WANT OF SHAPES OF DREARINESS THROUGH AND IN AND OUT OF EVERY THRUP AND THRUM OF WEARINESS SCARCELY HOPING EVER MORE TO FIND OUR WAY OUT AND DISCOVER MEMORY OF MEN FOR US WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
3588-180957-0003 WE SAW A GRAND SIGHT THE DAY HAD BEEN DREADFULLY HOT AND BAFFLING WITH SUDDEN SWIRLS OF RED DUST ARISING AND DRIVING THE GREAT DROUGHT INTO US TO WALK HAD BEEN WORSE THAN TO DRAG ONE'S WAY THROUGH A STUBBLY BED OF STING NETTLES
3588-180957-0004 DISFIGURES THE BEAUTY OF THE SIERRA ON EITHER SIDE IN PURPLE DISTANCE SPRANG SKY PIERCING OBELISKS AND VAPOR MANTLED GLACIERS SPANGLED WITH BRIGHT SNOW AND SHODDEN WITH ETERNAL FOREST
3588-180957-0005 BEFORE US LAY THE BROAD LUXURIANT PLAINS OF CALIFORNIA CHECKERED WITH MORE TINTS THAN ANY OTHER PIECE OF EARTH CAN SHOW SLEEPING IN ALLUVIAL EASE AND VEINED WITH SOFT BLUE WATERS
3588-180957-0006 AND THROUGH A GAP IN THE BROWN COAST RANGE AT TWENTY LEAGUES OF DISTANCE A LIGHT SO FAINT AS TO SEEM A SHADOW HOVERED ABOVE THE PACIFIC BUT NONE OF ALL THIS GRANDEUR TOUCHED OUR HEARTS EXCEPT THE WATER GLEAM
3588-180957-0007 PARCHED WITH THIRST I CAUGHT MY FATHER'S ARM AND TRIED TO URGE HIM ON TOWARD THE BLUE ENCHANTMENT OF ECSTATIC LIVING WATER BUT TO MY SURPRISE HE STAGGERED BACK AND HIS FACE GREW AS WHITE AS THE DISTANT SNOW
3588-180957-0008 I MANAGED TO GET HIM TO A SANDY LEDGE WITH THE HELP OF HIS OWN ENDEAVORS AND THERE LET HIM REST AND TRY TO SPEAK
3588-180957-0009 MY LITTLE CHILD HE SAID AT LAST AS IF WE WERE FALLEN BACK TEN YEARS PUT YOUR HAND WHERE I CAN FEEL IT MY HAND ALL THE WHILE HAD BEEN IN HIS
3588-180957-0010 AND TO LET HIM KNOW WHERE IT WAS IT MOVED BUT COLD FEAR STOPPED MY TALKING MY CHILD I HAVE NOT BEEN KIND TO YOU MY FATHER SLOWLY SPOKE AGAIN
3588-180957-0011 BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN FROM WANT OF LOVE SOME DAY YOU WILL SEE ALL THIS AND SOME DAY YOU WILL PARDON ME HE LAID ONE HEAVY ARM AROUND ME AND FORGETTING THIRST AND PAIN
3588-180957-0012 WITH THE LAST INTENSITY OF EYESIGHT WATCHED THE SUN DEPARTING TO ME I KNOW NOT HOW GREAT AWE WAS EVERY WHERE AND SADNESS THE CONICAL POINT OF THE FURIOUS SUN WHICH LIKE A BARB HAD PIERCED US
3588-180957-0013 WAS BROADENING INTO A HAZY DISK INEFFICIENT BUT BENEVOLENT UNDERNEATH HIM DEPTH OF NIGHT WAS WAITING TO COME UPWARD AFTER LETTING HIM FALL THROUGH AND STAIN HIS TRACK WITH REDNESS ALREADY THE ARMS OF DARKNESS
3588-180957-0014 HIS UPPER ARC WAS PURE AND KEEN BUT THE LOWER WAS FLAKED WITH ATMOSPHERE A GLOW OF HAZY LIGHT SOON WOULD FOLLOW AND ONE BRIGHT GLIMMER ADDRESSED MORE TO THE SKY THAN TO THE EARTH AND AFTER THAT A BROAD SOFT GLEAM
3588-180957-0015 AND AFTER THAT HOW MANY A MAN SHOULD NEVER SEE THE SUN AGAIN AND AMONG THEM WOULD BE MY FATHER HE FOR THE MOMENT RESTING THERE WITH HEAVY LIGHT UPON HIM
3588-180957-0016 AND THE DARK JAWS OF THE MOUNTAIN DESERT YAWNING WIDE BEHIND HIM AND ALL THE BEAUTIFUL EXPANSE OF LIBERAL EARTH BEFORE HIM EVEN SO HE SEEMED TO ME OF ALL THE THINGS IN SIGHT THE ONE THAT FIRST WOULD DRAW ATTENTION
3588-180957-0017 AND THE SAD TRANQUILLITY WHICH COMES TO THOSE WHO KNOW WHAT HUMAN LIFE IS THROUGH CONTINUAL HUMAN DEATH ALTHOUGH IN THE MATTER OF BODILY STRENGTH HE WAS LITTLE PAST THE PRIME OF LIFE HIS LONG AND ABUNDANT HAIR WAS WHITE
3588-180957-0018 AND HIS BROAD AND UPRIGHT FOREHEAD MARKED WITH THE MESHES OF THE NET OF CARE BUT DROUGHT AND FAMINE AND LONG FATIGUE HAD FAILED EVEN NOW TO CHANGE OR WEAKEN THE FINE EXPRESSION OF HIS LARGE SAD EYES
3588-180957-0019 THOSE EYES ALONE WOULD HAVE MADE THE FACE REMARKABLE AMONG TEN THOUSAND SO DEEP WITH SETTLED GLOOM THEY WERE AND DARK WITH FATAL SORROW SUCH EYES MIGHT FITLY HAVE TOLD THE GRIEF OF ADRASTUS SON OF GORDIAS WHO
3588-180957-0020 HAVING SLAIN HIS OWN BROTHER UNWITTING UNWITTING SLEW THE ONLY SON OF HIS GENEROUS HOST AND SAVIOR THE PALE GLOBE OF THE SUN HUNG TREMBLING IN THE HAZE HIMSELF HAD MADE MY FATHER ROSE TO SEE THE LAST
3588-180957-0021 AND REARED HIS TALL FORM UPRIGHT AGAINST THE DEEPENING BACKGROUND HE GAZED AS IF THE COURSE OF LIFE LAY VANISHING BELOW HIM WHILE LEVEL LAND AND WATERS DREW THE BREADTH OF SHADOW OVER THEM
3588-180957-0022 THEN THE LAST GLEAM FLOWED AND FLED UPON THE FACE OF OCEAN AND MY FATHER PUT HIS DRY LIPS TO MY FOREHEAD SAYING NOTHING HIS LIPS MIGHT WELL BE DRY FOR HE HAD NOT SWALLOWED WATER FOR THREE DAYS
3588-180957-0023 BUT IT FRIGHTENED ME TO FEEL HOW COLD THEY WERE AND EVEN TREMULOUS LET US RUN LET US RUN MY DEAR FATHER I CRIED DELICIOUS WATER THE DARK FALLS QUICKLY BUT WE CAN GET THERE BEFORE DARK
3588-180957-0024 IT IS ALL DOWN HILL OH DO LET US RUN AT ONCE
3588-180957-0025 WE HAVE ESCAPED FROM THAT STARVING DESERT AT A SPOT AT A SPOT WHERE WE CAN SEE
3588-180957-0026 AND THE HAND WITH WHICH HE TRIED TO POINT SOME DISTANT LANDMARK FELL AWAY HIS FACE WHICH HAD BEEN SO PALE BEFORE BECAME OF A DEADLY WHITENESS AND HE BREATHED WITH GASPS OF AGONY I KNELT BEFORE HIM AND TOOK HIS HANDS
3588-180957-0027 AND TRIED TO RUB THE PALMS AND DID WHATEVER I COULD THINK OF
3588-180957-0028 WHAT A BRUTE I WAS TO LET YOU DO IT BUT I DID NOT KNOW I NEVER KNEW PLEASE GOD TO TAKE ME ALSO HE COULD NOT MANAGE TO ANSWER THIS EVEN IF HE UNDERSTOOD IT
3588-180957-0029 BUT HE FIRMLY LIFTED HIS ARM AGAIN AND TRIED TO MAKE ME FOLLOW IT WHAT DOES IT MATTER OH NEVER MIND NEVER MIND SUCH A WRETCH AS I AM FATHER ONLY TRY TO TELL ME WHAT I OUGHT TO DO FOR YOU
3588-180957-0030 MY CHILD MY CHILD WERE HIS ONLY WORDS AND HE KEPT ON SAYING MY CHILD MY CHILD AS IF HE LIKED THE SOUND OF IT
3588-180957-0031 AT WHAT TIME OF THE NIGHT MY FATHER DIED I KNEW NOT THEN OR AFTERWARD IT MAY HAVE BEEN BEFORE THE MOON CAME OVER THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS OR IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN TILL THE WORN OUT STARS IN VAIN REPELLED THE DAYBREAK
3588-180957-0032 ALL I KNOW IS THAT I EVER STROVE TO KEEP MORE NEAR TO HIM THROUGH THE NIGHT TO CHERISH HIS FAILING WARMTH AND QUICKEN THE SLOW LABORIOUS HARASSED BREATH
3588-180957-0033 FROM TIME TO TIME HE TRIED TO PRAY TO GOD FOR ME AND FOR HIMSELF BUT EVERY TIME HIS MIND BEGAN TO WANDER AND TO SLIP AWAY AS IF THROUGH WANT OF PRACTICE
3588-180957-0034 FOR THE CHILLS OF MANY WRETCHED YEARS HAD DEADENED AND BENUMBED HIS FAITH HE KNEW ME NOW AND THEN BETWIXT THE CONFLICT AND THE STUPOR FOR MORE THAN ONCE HE MUTTERED FEEBLY AND AS IF FROM OUT A DREAM
3588-180957-0035 TIME FOR EREMA TO GO ON HER WAY GO ON YOUR WAY AND SAVE YOUR LIFE SAVE YOUR LIFE EREMA THERE WAS NO WAY FOR ME TO GO EXCEPT ON MY KNEES BEFORE HIM
3588-180957-0036 LIGHT RUBBING I WHISPERED INTO HIS EAR MY NAME THAT HE MIGHT SPEAK ONCE MORE TO ME AND WHEN HE COULD NOT SPEAK I TRIED TO SAY WHAT HE WOULD SAY TO ME
3588-180957-0037 AT LAST WITH A BLOW THAT STUNNED ALL WORDS IT SMOTE MY STUPID WANDERING MIND THAT ALL I HAD TO SPEAK AND SMILE TO ALL I CARED TO PLEASE AND SERVE THE ONLY ONE LEFT TO ADMIRE AND LOVE
3588-180957-0038 AND IN THE ANGUISH OF MY SOBBING LITTLE THINGS CAME HOME TO ME A THOUSAND LITTLE THINGS THAT SHOWED HOW QUIETLY HE HAD PREPARED FOR THIS AND PROVIDED FOR ME ONLY COLD DESPAIR AND SELF REPROACH AND STRONG REBELLION DAZED ME
3588-180957-0039 UNTIL I LAY AT MY FATHER'S SIDE AND SLEPT WITH HIS DEAD HAND IN MINE THERE IN THE DESERT OF DESOLATION PIOUS AWE EMBRACED ME AND SMALL PHANTASMS OF INDIVIDUAL FEAR COULD NOT COME NIGH ME
3588-180957-0040 BY AND BY LONG SHADOWS OF MORNING CREPT TOWARD ME DISMALLY AND THE PALLID LIGHT OF THE HILLS WAS STRETCHED IN WEARY STREAKS AWAY FROM ME HOW I AROSE OR WHAT I DID OR WHAT I THOUGHT
3588-180957-0041 IS NOTHING NOW SUCH TIMES ARE NOT FOR TALKING OF HOW MANY HEARTS OF ANGUISH LIE FORLORN WITH NONE TO COMFORT THEM WITH ALL THE JOY OF LIFE DIED OUT AND ALL THE FEAR OF HAVING YET TO LIVE IN FRONT ARISING
3588-180957-0042 YOUNG AND WEAK AND WRONG OF SEX FOR DOING ANY VALIANCE LONG I LAY BY MY FATHER'S BODY WRINGING OUT MY WRETCHEDNESS THIRST AND FAMINE NOW HAD FLOWN INTO THE OPPOSITE EXTREME
3588-180957-0043 I SEEMED TO LOATHE THE THOUGHT OF WATER AND THE SMELL OF FOOD WOULD HAVE MADE ME SICK I OPENED MY FATHER'S KNAPSACK AND A PANG OF NEW MISERY SEIZED ME THERE LAY NEARLY ALL HIS RATIONS
3588-180957-0044 WHICH HE HAD MADE PRETENSE TO EAT AS HE GAVE ME MINE FROM TIME TO TIME HE HAD STARVED HIMSELF SINCE HE FAILED OF HIS MARK AND LEARNED OUR RISK OF FAMISHING ALL HIS OWN FOOD HE HAD KEPT FOR ME AS WELL AS HIS STORE OF WATER
3588-180957-0045 AND I HAD DONE NOTHING BUT GRUMBLE AND GROAN EVEN WHILE CONSUMING EVERY THING COMPARED WITH ME THE HOVERING VULTURES MIGHT BE CONSIDERED ANGELS
3588-180957-0046 I WAS A GREAT DEAL TOO WORN OUT TO CRY OR SOB SIMPLY TO BREAK DOWN MAY BE THE PUREST MERCY THAT CAN FALL ON TRULY HOPELESS MISERY
