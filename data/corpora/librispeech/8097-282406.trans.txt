8097-282406-0000 THE FARMER AND THE CRANES SOME CRANES SAW A FARMER PLOWING A LARGE FIELD WHEN THE WORK OF PLOWING WAS DONE THEY PATIENTLY WATCHED HIM SOW THE SEED
8097-282406-0001 IT WAS THEIR FEAST THEY THOUGHT SO AS SOON AS THE FARMER HAD FINISHED PLANTING AND HAD GONE HOME DOWN THEY FLEW TO THE FIELD AND BEGAN TO EAT AS FAST AS THEY COULD
8097-282406-0002 THE FARMER OF COURSE KNEW THE CRANES AND THEIR WAYS HE HAD HAD EXPERIENCE WITH SUCH BIRDS BEFORE HE SOON RETURNED TO THE FIELD WITH A SLING BUT HE DID NOT BRING ANY STONES WITH HIM
8097-282406-0003 HE EXPECTED TO SCARE THE CRANES JUST BY SWINGING THE SLING IN THE AIR AND SHOUTING LOUDLY AT THEM AT FIRST THE CRANES FLEW AWAY IN GREAT TERROR BUT THEY SOON BEGAN TO SEE THAT NONE OF THEM EVER GOT HURT
8097-282406-0004 AND AS FOR WORDS THEY WOULD KILL NOBODY AT LAST THEY PAID NO ATTENTION WHATEVER TO THE FARMER THE FARMER SAW THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE OTHER MEASURES
8097-282406-0005 THAT HARD FISTS ARE LACKING THE FARMER AND HIS SONS A RICH OLD FARMER WHO FELT THAT HE HAD NOT MANY MORE DAYS TO LIVE
8097-282406-0006 CALLED HIS SONS TO HIS BEDSIDE MY SONS HE SAID HEED WHAT I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU DO NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT PART WITH THE ESTATE THAT HAS BELONGED TO OUR FAMILY FOR SO MANY GENERATIONS
8097-282406-0007 SOMEWHERE ON IT IS HIDDEN A RICH TREASURE I DO NOT KNOW THE EXACT SPOT BUT IT IS THERE AND YOU WILL SURELY FIND IT SPARE NO ENERGY AND LEAVE NO SPOT UNTURNED
8097-282406-0008 IN YOUR SEARCH THE FATHER DIED AND NO SOONER WAS HE IN HIS GRAVE THAN THE SONS SET TO WORK DIGGING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT TURNING UP EVERY FOOT OF GROUND WITH THEIR SPADES
8097-282406-0009 BUT AT HARVEST TIME WHEN THEY HAD SETTLED THEIR ACCOUNTS AND HAD POCKETED A RICH PROFIT
8097-282406-0010 THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE TREASURE THEIR FATHER HAD TOLD THEM ABOUT WAS THE WEALTH OF A BOUNTIFUL CROP AND THAT IN THEIR INDUSTRY HAD THEY FOUND THE TREASURE INDUSTRY IS ITSELF
8097-282406-0011 TWO POTS ONE OF BRASS AND THE OTHER OF CLAY STOOD TOGETHER ON THE HEARTHSTONE ONE DAY THE BRASS POT PROPOSED TO THE EARTHEN POT THAT THEY GO OUT INTO THE WORLD TOGETHER
8097-282406-0012 BUT THE EARTHEN POT EXCUSED HIMSELF SAYING THAT IT WOULD BE WISER FOR HIM TO STAY IN THE CORNER BY THE FIRE IT WOULD TAKE SO LITTLE TO BREAK ME HE SAID YOU KNOW HOW FRAGILE I AM
8097-282406-0013 THE LEAST SHOCK IS SURE TO SHATTER ME DON'T LET THAT KEEP YOU AT HOME URGED THE BRASS POT I SHALL TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF YOU IF WE SHOULD HAPPEN TO MEET ANYTHING HARD I WILL STEP BETWEEN AND SAVE YOU
8097-282406-0014 SO THE EARTHEN POT AT LAST CONSENTED AND THE TWO SET OUT SIDE BY SIDE JOLTING ALONG ON THREE STUBBY LEGS FIRST TO THIS SIDE THEN TO THAT AND BUMPING INTO EACH OTHER AT EVERY STEP
8097-282406-0015 THE EARTHEN POT COULD NOT SURVIVE THAT SORT OF COMPANIONSHIP VERY LONG THEY HAD NOT GONE TEN PACES BEFORE THE EARTHEN POT CRACKED AND AT THE NEXT JOLT
8097-282406-0016 HE FLEW INTO A THOUSAND PIECES EQUALS MAKE THE BEST FRIENDS THE GOOSE AND THE GOLDEN EGG
8097-282406-0017 THERE WAS ONCE A COUNTRYMAN WHO POSSESSED THE MOST WONDERFUL GOOSE YOU CAN IMAGINE FOR EVERY DAY WHEN HE VISITED THE NEST THE GOOSE HAD LAID A BEAUTIFUL GLITTERING GOLDEN EGG
8097-282406-0018 THE COUNTRYMAN TOOK THE EGGS TO MARKET AND SOON BEGAN TO GET RICH BUT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE GREW IMPATIENT WITH THE GOOSE BECAUSE SHE GAVE HIM ONLY A SINGLE GOLDEN EGG A DAY
8097-282406-0019 HE WAS NOT GETTING RICH FAST ENOUGH THEN ONE DAY AFTER HE HAD FINISHED COUNTING HIS MONEY THE IDEA CAME TO HIM THAT HE COULD GET ALL THE GOLDEN EGGS AT ONCE BY KILLING THE GOOSE
8097-282406-0020 AND CUTTING IT OPEN BUT WHEN THE DEED WAS DONE NOT A SINGLE GOLDEN EGG DID HE FIND AND HIS PRECIOUS GOOSE WAS DEAD
