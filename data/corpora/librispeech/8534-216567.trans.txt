8534-216567-0000 MONSIEUR BEFORE RESUMING MY INQUIRIES INTO GOVERNMENT AND PROPERTY IT IS FITTING FOR THE SATISFACTION OF SOME WORTHY PEOPLE AND ALSO IN THE INTEREST OF ORDER THAT I SHOULD MAKE TO YOU A PLAIN STRAIGHTFORWARD EXPLANATION
8534-216567-0001 IN A MUCH GOVERNED STATE NO ONE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO ATTACK THE EXTERNAL FORM OF THE SOCIETY AND THE GROUNDWORK OF ITS INSTITUTIONS UNTIL HE HAD ESTABLISHED HIS RIGHT TO DO SO FIRST BY HIS MORALITY SECOND BY HIS CAPACITY AND THIRD BY THE PURITY OF HIS INTENTIONS
8534-216567-0002 ANY ONE WHO WISHING TO PUBLISH A TREATISE UPON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COUNTRY COULD NOT SATISFY THIS THREEFOLD CONDITION WOULD BE OBLIGED TO PROCURE THE ENDORSEMENT OF A RESPONSIBLE PATRON POSSESSING THE REQUISITE QUALIFICATIONS BUT WE FRENCHMEN HAVE THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS
8534-216567-0003 THIS GRAND RIGHT THE SWORD OF THOUGHT WHICH ELEVATES THE VIRTUOUS CITIZEN TO THE RANK OF LEGISLATOR AND MAKES THE MALICIOUS CITIZEN AN AGENT OF DISCORD FREES US FROM ALL PRELIMINARY RESPONSIBILITY TO THE LAW
8534-216567-0004 BUT IT DOES NOT RELEASE US FROM OUR INTERNAL OBLIGATION TO RENDER A PUBLIC ACCOUNT OF OUR SENTIMENTS AND THOUGHTS I HAVE USED IN ALL ITS FULNESS AND CONCERNING AN IMPORTANT QUESTION THE RIGHT WHICH THE CHARTER GRANTS US
8534-216567-0005 YOU HAVE CRITICISED IN A KINDLY SPIRIT I HAD ALMOST SAID WITH PARTIALITY FOR THE WRITER A WORK WHICH TEACHES A DOCTRINE THAT YOU THOUGHT IT YOUR DUTY TO CONDEMN THE ACADEMY OF MORAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES SAID YOU IN YOUR REPORT
8534-216567-0006 I VENTURE TO HOPE SIR THAT AFTER YOU HAVE READ THIS LETTER IF YOUR PRUDENCE STILL RESTRAINS YOU YOUR FAIRNESS WILL INDUCE YOU TO DO ME JUSTICE
8534-216567-0007 SUCH IS THE THESIS WHICH I MAINTAINED AND DEVELOPED IN A MEMOIR BEARING THE TITLE WHAT IS PROPERTY OR AN INQUIRY INTO THE PRINCIPLE OF RIGHT AND OF GOVERNMENT THE IDEA OF SOCIAL EQUALITY EVEN IN INDIVIDUAL FORTUNES HAS IN ALL AGES BESIEGED LIKE A VAGUE PRESENTIMENT
8534-216567-0008 THE HUMAN IMAGINATION POETS HAVE SUNG OF IT IN THEIR HYMNS PHILOSOPHERS HAVE DREAMED OF IT IN THEIR UTOPIAS PRIESTS TEACH IT BUT ONLY FOR THE SPIRITUAL WORLD THE PEOPLE GOVERNED BY IT
8534-216567-0009 AND THE CIVIL POWER IS NEVER MORE DISTURBED THAN BY THE FABLES OF THE AGE OF GOLD AND THE REIGN OF ASTREA A YEAR AGO HOWEVER THIS IDEA RECEIVED A SCIENTIFIC DEMONSTRATION WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN SATISFACTORILY ANSWERED AND PERMIT ME TO ADD NEVER WILL BE
8534-216567-0010 THIS DEMONSTRATION OWING TO ITS SLIGHTLY IMPASSIONED STYLE ITS METHOD OF REASONING WHICH WAS SO AT VARIANCE WITH THAT EMPLOYED BY THE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AUTHORITIES AND THE IMPORTANCE AND NOVELTY OF ITS CONCLUSIONS WAS OF A NATURE TO CAUSE SOME ALARM
8534-216567-0011 AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN DANGEROUS HAD IT NOT BEEN AS YOU SIR SO WELL SAID A SEALED LETTER SO FAR AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC WAS CONCERNED ADDRESSED ONLY TO MEN OF INTELLIGENCE I WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT THROUGH ITS METAPHYSICAL DRESS YOU RECOGNIZED THE WISE FORESIGHT OF THE AUTHOR AND I THANK YOU FOR IT
8534-216567-0012 MAY GOD GRANT THAT MY INTENTIONS WHICH ARE WHOLLY PEACEFUL MAY NEVER BE CHARGED UPON ME AS TREASONABLE LIKE A STONE THROWN INTO A MASS OF SERPENTS THE FIRST MEMOIR ON PROPERTY EXCITED INTENSE ANIMOSITY AND AROUSED THE PASSIONS OF MANY
8534-216567-0013 BUT WHILE SOME WISHED THE AUTHOR AND HIS WORK TO BE PUBLICLY DENOUNCED OTHERS FOUND IN THEM SIMPLY THE SOLUTION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS OF SOCIETY A FEW EVEN BASING EVIL SPECULATIONS UPON THE NEW LIGHT WHICH THEY HAD OBTAINED
8534-216567-0014 IT WAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED THAT A SYSTEM OF INDUCTIONS ABSTRACTLY GATHERED TOGETHER AND STILL MORE ABSTRACTLY EXPRESSED WOULD BE UNDERSTOOD WITH EQUAL ACCURACY IN ITS ENSEMBLE AND IN EACH OF ITS PARTS
8534-216567-0015 TO FIND THE LAW OF EQUALITY NO LONGER IN CHARITY AND SELF SACRIFICE WHICH ARE NOT BINDING IN THEIR NATURE BUT IN JUSTICE TO BASE EQUALITY OF FUNCTIONS UPON EQUALITY OF PERSONS TO DETERMINE THE ABSOLUTE PRINCIPLE OF EXCHANGE
8534-216567-0016 TO NEUTRALIZE THE INEQUALITY OF INDIVIDUAL FACULTIES BY COLLECTIVE FORCE TO ESTABLISH AN EQUATION BETWEEN PROPERTY AND ROBBERY TO CHANGE THE LAW OF SUCCESSION WITHOUT DESTROYING THE PRINCIPLE
8534-216567-0017 TO SYNTHETIZE THE MONARCHICAL AND DEMOCRATIC FORMS OF GOVERNMENT TO REVERSE THE DIVISION OF POWERS TO GIVE THE EXECUTIVE POWER TO THE NATION AND TO MAKE LEGISLATION A POSITIVE FIXED AND ABSOLUTE SCIENCE WHAT A SERIES OF PARADOXES WHAT A STRING OF DELUSIONS
8534-216567-0018 IF I MAY NOT SAY WHAT A CHAIN OF TRUTHS BUT IT IS NOT MY PURPOSE HERE TO PASS UPON THE THEORY OF THE RIGHT OF POSSESSION I DISCUSS NO DOGMAS MY ONLY OBJECT IS TO JUSTIFY MY VIEWS AND TO SHOW THAT IN WRITING AS I DID I NOT ONLY EXERCISED A RIGHT BUT PERFORMED A DUTY
8534-216567-0019 YES I HAVE ATTACKED PROPERTY AND SHALL ATTACK IT AGAIN BUT SIR BEFORE DEMANDING THAT I SHALL MAKE THE AMENDE HONORABLE FOR HAVING OBEYED MY CONSCIENCE AND SPOKEN THE EXACT TRUTH CONDESCEND I BEG OF YOU TO CAST A GLANCE AT THE EVENTS WHICH ARE HAPPENING AROUND US
8534-216567-0020 LOOK AT OUR DEPUTIES OUR MAGISTRATES OUR PHILOSOPHERS OUR MINISTERS OUR PROFESSORS AND OUR PUBLICISTS EXAMINE THEIR METHODS OF DEALING WITH THE MATTER OF PROPERTY
8534-216567-0021 MEASURE THE BREACHES ALREADY MADE ESTIMATE THOSE WHICH SOCIETY THINKS OF MAKING HEREAFTER ADD THE IDEAS CONCERNING PROPERTY HELD BY ALL THEORIES IN COMMON INTERROGATE HISTORY AND THEN TELL ME WHAT WILL BE LEFT HALF A CENTURY HENCE OF THIS OLD RIGHT OF PROPERTY
8534-216567-0022 AND THUS PERCEIVING THAT I HAVE SO MANY ACCOMPLICES YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY DECLARE ME INNOCENT WHAT IS THE LAW OF EXPROPRIATION ON THE GROUND OF PUBLIC UTILITY WHICH EVERYBODY FAVORS AND WHICH IS EVEN THOUGHT TOO LENIENT
8534-216567-0023 SOCIETY INDEMNIFIES IT IS SAID THE DISPOSSESSED PROPRIETOR BUT DOES IT RETURN TO HIM THE TRADITIONAL ASSOCIATIONS THE POETIC CHARM AND THE FAMILY PRIDE WHICH ACCOMPANY PROPERTY
8534-216567-0024 AMONG THE ANCIENTS THE REFUSAL OF THE INDIVIDUAL LIMITED THE POWERS OF THE STATE
8534-216567-0025 PROPERTY IS A REAL RIGHT JUS IN RE A RIGHT INHERENT IN THE THING AND WHOSE PRINCIPLE LIES IN THE EXTERNAL MANIFESTATION OF MAN'S WILL MAN LEAVES HIS IMPRINT STAMPS HIS CHARACTER UPON THE OBJECTS OF HIS HANDIWORK
8534-216567-0026 THIS PLASTIC FORCE OF MAN AS THE MODERN JURISTS SAY IS THE SEAL WHICH SET UPON MATTER MAKES IT HOLY WHOEVER LAYS HANDS UPON IT AGAINST THE PROPRIETOR'S WILL DOES VIOLENCE TO THE LATTER'S PERSONALITY AND YET WHEN AN ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE SAW FIT TO DECLARE THAT PUBLIC UTILITY REQUIRED IT
8534-216567-0027 PROPERTY HAD TO GIVE WAY TO THE GENERAL WILL SOON IN THE NAME OF PUBLIC UTILITY METHODS OF CULTIVATION AND CONDITIONS OF ENJOYMENT WILL BE PRESCRIBED INSPECTORS OF AGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURES WILL BE APPOINTED
8534-216567-0028 AND A GENERAL SUPERINTENDENCE OF PRODUCTION WILL BE ESTABLISHED IT IS NOT TWO YEARS SINCE I SAW A PROPRIETOR DESTROY A FOREST MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED ACRES IN EXTENT IF PUBLIC UTILITY HAD INTERFERED THAT FOREST THE ONLY ONE FOR MILES AROUND WOULD STILL BE STANDING
8534-216567-0029 BUT IT IS SAID EXPROPRIATION ON THE GROUND OF PUBLIC UTILITY IS ONLY AN EXCEPTION WHICH CONFIRMS THE PRINCIPLE AND BEARS TESTIMONY IN FAVOR OF THE RIGHT
8534-216567-0030 VERY WELL BUT FROM THIS EXCEPTION WE WILL PASS TO ANOTHER FROM THAT TO A THIRD AND SO ON FROM EXCEPTIONS TO EXCEPTIONS UNTIL WE HAVE REDUCED THE RULE TO A PURE ABSTRACTION HOW MANY SUPPORTERS DO YOU THINK SIR CAN BE CLAIMED FOR THE PROJECT OF THE CONVERSION OF THE PUBLIC FUNDS
8534-216567-0031 NOW THIS SO CALLED CONVERSION IS AN EXTENSIVE EXPROPRIATION AND IN THIS CASE WITH NO INDEMNITY WHATEVER THE PUBLIC FUNDS ARE SO MUCH REAL ESTATE THE INCOME FROM WHICH THE PROPRIETOR COUNTS UPON WITH PERFECT SAFETY
8534-216567-0032 AND WHICH OWES ITS VALUE TO THE TACIT PROMISE OF THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY INTEREST UPON IT AT THE ESTABLISHED RATE UNTIL THE FUND HOLDER APPLIES FOR REDEMPTION FOR IF THE INCOME IS LIABLE TO DIMINUTION IT IS LESS PROFITABLE THAN HOUSE RENT OR FARM RENT
8534-216567-0033 WHOSE RATES MAY RISE OR FALL ACCORDING TO THE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET AND IN THAT CASE WHAT INDUCEMENT HAS THE CAPITALIST TO INVEST HIS MONEY IN THE STATE WHEN THEN YOU FORCE THE FUND HOLDER TO SUBMIT TO A DIMINUTION OF INTEREST YOU MAKE HIM BANKRUPT TO THE EXTENT OF THE DIMINUTION
8534-216567-0034 AND SINCE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE CONVERSION AN EQUALLY PROFITABLE INVESTMENT BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE YOU DEPRECIATE HIS PROPERTY THAT SUCH A MEASURE MAY BE JUSTLY EXECUTED IT MUST BE GENERALIZED
8534-216567-0035 THAT IS THE LAW WHICH PROVIDES FOR IT MUST DECREE ALSO THAT INTEREST ON SUMS LENT ON DEPOSIT OR ON MORTGAGE THROUGHOUT THE REALM AS WELL AS HOUSE AND FARM RENTS SHALL BE REDUCED TO THREE PER CENT THIS SIMULTANEOUS REDUCTION OF ALL KINDS OF INCOME
8534-216567-0036 AND FURTHER IT WOULD OFFER THE ADVANTAGE OF FORESTALLING AT ONE BLOW ALL OBJECTIONS TO IT AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT WOULD INSURE A JUST ASSESSMENT OF THE LAND TAX SEE IF AT THE MOMENT OF CONVERSION A PIECE OF REAL ESTATE YIELDS AN INCOME OF ONE THOUSAND FRANCS
8534-216567-0037 AFTER THE NEW LAW TAKES EFFECT IT WILL YIELD ONLY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS NOW ALLOWING THE TAX TO BE AN ALIQUOT PART ONE FOURTH FOR EXAMPLE OF THE INCOME DERIVED FROM EACH PIECE OF PROPERTY
8534-216567-0038 IT IS CLEAR ON THE ONE HAND THAT THE PROPRIETOR WOULD NOT IN ORDER TO LIGHTEN HIS SHARE OF THE TAX UNDERESTIMATE THE VALUE OF HIS PROPERTY SINCE HOUSE AND FARM RENTS BEING FIXED BY THE VALUE OF THE CAPITAL AND THE LATTER BEING MEASURED BY THE TAX TO DEPRECIATE HIS REAL ESTATE WOULD BE TO REDUCE HIS REVENUE
8534-216567-0039 ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS EQUALLY EVIDENT THAT THE SAME PROPRIETORS COULD NOT OVERESTIMATE THE VALUE OF THEIR PROPERTY IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR INCOMES BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE LAW SINCE THE TENANTS AND FARMERS WITH THEIR OLD LEASES IN THEIR HANDS WOULD ENTER A PROTEST
8534-216567-0040 SUCH SIR MUST BE THE RESULT SOONER OR LATER OF THE CONVERSION WHICH HAS BEEN SO LONG DEMANDED OTHERWISE THE FINANCIAL OPERATION OF WHICH WE ARE SPEAKING WOULD BE A CRYING INJUSTICE UNLESS INTENDED AS A STEPPING STONE
8534-216567-0041 THIS LAST MOTIVE SEEMS THE MOST PLAUSIBLE ONE FOR IN SPITE OF THE CLAMORS OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND THE FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF CERTAIN RIGHTS THE PUBLIC CONSCIENCE IS BOUND TO FULFIL ITS DESIRE AND IS NO MORE AFFECTED WHEN CHARGED WITH ATTACKING PROPERTY THAN WHEN LISTENING TO THE COMPLAINTS OF THE BONDHOLDERS
8534-216567-0042 IN THIS CASE INSTINCTIVE JUSTICE BELIES LEGAL JUSTICE WHO HAS NOT HEARD OF THE INEXTRICABLE CONFUSION INTO WHICH THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES WAS THROWN LAST YEAR WHILE DISCUSSING THE QUESTION OF COLONIAL AND NATIVE SUGARS DID THEY LEAVE THESE TWO INDUSTRIES TO THEMSELVES
8534-216567-0043 THE NATIVE MANUFACTURER WAS RUINED BY THE COLONIST TO MAINTAIN THE BEET ROOT THE CANE HAD TO BE TAXED TO PROTECT THE PROPERTY OF THE ONE IT BECAME NECESSARY TO VIOLATE THE PROPERTY OF THE OTHER THE MOST REMARKABLE FEATURE OF THIS BUSINESS WAS PRECISELY THAT TO WHICH THE LEAST ATTENTION WAS PAID
8534-216567-0044 NAMELY THAT IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER PROPERTY HAD TO BE VIOLATED DID THEY IMPOSE ON EACH INDUSTRY A PROPORTIONAL TAX SO AS TO PRESERVE A BALANCE IN THE MARKET
8534-216567-0045 THEY CREATED A MAXIMUM PRICE FOR EACH VARIETY OF SUGAR AND AS THIS MAXIMUM PRICE WAS NOT THE SAME THEY ATTACKED PROPERTY IN TWO WAYS ON THE ONE HAND INTERFERING WITH THE LIBERTY OF TRADE ON THE OTHER DISREGARDING THE EQUALITY OF PROPRIETORS
8534-216567-0046 DID THEY SUPPRESS THE BEET ROOT BY GRANTING AN INDEMNITY TO THE MANUFACTURER THEY SACRIFICED THE PROPERTY OF THE TAX PAYER FINALLY DID THEY PREFER TO CULTIVATE THE TWO VARIETIES OF SUGAR AT THE NATION'S EXPENSE JUST AS DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF TOBACCO ARE CULTIVATED
8534-216567-0047 THEY ABOLISHED SO FAR AS THE SUGAR INDUSTRY WAS CONCERNED THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY
