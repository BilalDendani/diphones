5802-76044-0000 THEY TOOK A TURN ABOUT THE WALLS WITH THE MOON SINKING OVER BEYOND SILBURY
5802-76044-0001 THERE WERE LONG INTERVALS OF FRIENDLY SILENCE I DON'T IN THE LEAST WANT TO GO ON TALKING ABOUT MYSELF SAID SIR RICHMOND ABRUPTLY LET IT REST THEN SAID THE DOCTOR GENEROUSLY TO DAY AMONG THESE ANCIENT MEMORIES HAS TAKEN ME OUT OF MYSELF WONDERFULLY
5802-76044-0002 TO LOOK AT MYSELF AS A CASE NOW I CAN EVEN SEE MYSELF AS A REMOTE CASE THAT I NEEDN'T BOTHER ABOUT FURTHER SO FAR AS THAT GOES I THINK WE HAVE DONE ALL THAT THERE IS TO BE DONE I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT QUITE YET SAID THE DOCTOR
5802-76044-0003 I DON'T THINK I'M A SUBJECT FOR REAL PSYCHOANALYSIS AT ALL I'M NOT AN OVERLAID SORT OF PERSON WHEN I SPREAD MYSELF OUT THERE IS NOT MUCH INDICATION OF A SUPPRESSED WISH OR OF ANYTHING MASKED OR BURIED OF THAT SORT
5802-76044-0004 WHAT YOU GET IS A QUITE OPEN AND RECOGNIZED DISCORD OF TWO SETS OF MOTIVES THE DOCTOR CONSIDERED
5802-76044-0005 YOUR LIBIDO IS I SHOULD SAY EXCEPTIONALLY FREE GENERALLY YOU ARE DOING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO OVERDOING IN FACT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND GETTING SIMPLY TIRED WHICH IS THE THEORY I STARTED WITH
5802-76044-0006 I AM A CASE OF FATIGUE UNDER IRRITATING CIRCUMSTANCES WITH VERY LITTLE MENTAL COMPLICATION OR CONCEALMENT YES SAID THE DOCTOR I AGREE YOU ARE NOT A CASE FOR PSYCHOANALYSIS STRICTLY SPEAKING AT ALL YOU ARE IN OPEN CONFLICT WITH YOURSELF
5802-76044-0007 UPON MORAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES PRACTICALLY OPEN YOUR PROBLEMS ARE PROBLEMS OF CONSCIOUS CONDUCT AS I SAID OF WHAT RENUNCIATIONS YOU HAVE CONSCIOUSLY TO MAKE SIR RICHMOND DID NOT ANSWER THAT
5802-76044-0008 THIS PILGRIMAGE OF OURS HE SAID PRESENTLY HAS MADE FOR MAGNANIMITY THIS DAY PARTICULARLY HAS BEEN A GOOD DAY WHEN WE STOOD ON THIS OLD WALL HERE IN THE SUNSET I SEEMED TO BE STANDING OUTSIDE MYSELF IN AN IMMENSE STILL SPHERE OF PAST AND FUTURE
5802-76044-0009 I STOOD WITH MY FEET UPON THE STONE AGE AND SAW MYSELF FOUR THOUSAND YEARS AWAY AND ALL MY DISTRESSES AS VERY LITTLE INCIDENTS IN THAT PERSPECTIVE AWAY THERE IN LONDON THE CASE IS ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT
5802-76044-0010 AFTER THREE HOURS OR SO OF THE COMMITTEE ONE CONCENTRATES INTO ONE LITTLE INFLAMED MOMENT OF PERSONALITY THERE IS NO PAST ANY LONGER THERE IS NO FUTURE THERE IS ONLY THE RANKLING DISPUTE FOR ALL THOSE THREE HOURS PERHAPS
5802-76044-0011 JUST HOW I HAD TO SAY IT JUST HOW I LOOKED WHILE I SAID IT JUST HOW MUCH I WAS MAKING MYSELF UNDERSTOOD HOW I MIGHT BE MISUNDERSTOOD HOW I MIGHT BE MISREPRESENTED CHALLENGED DENIED ONE DRAWS IN MORE AND MORE AS ONE IS USED UP
5802-76044-0012 AT LAST ONE IS REDUCED TO A LITTLE RAW BLEEDING DESPERATELY FIGHTING PIN POINT OF SELF ONE GOES BACK TO ONE'S HOME UNABLE TO RECOVER FIGHTING IT OVER AGAIN ALL NIGHT SOMETIMES I GET UP AND WALK ABOUT THE ROOM AND CURSE MARTINEAU
5802-76044-0013 HOW IS ONE TO GET THE AVEBURY FRAME OF MIND TO WESTMINSTER WHEN WESTMINSTER IS AS DEAD AS AVEBURY SAID THE DOCTOR UNHELPFULLY HE ADDED AFTER SOME SECONDS MILTON KNEW OF THESE TROUBLES NOT WITHOUT DUST AND HEAT HE WROTE
5802-76044-0014 A GREAT PHRASE BUT THE DUST CHOKES ME SAID SIR RICHMOND HE TOOK UP A COPY OF THE GREEN ROADS OF ENGLAND THAT LAY BESIDE HIM ON THE TABLE BUT HE DID NOT OPEN IT
5802-76044-0015 I DO NOT THINK THAT I SHALL STIR UP MY MOTIVES ANY MORE FOR A TIME BETTER TO GO ON INTO THE WEST COUNTRY COOLING MY POOR OLD BRAIN IN THESE WIDE SHADOWS OF THE PAST I CAN PRESCRIBE NOTHING BETTER SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU
5802-76044-0016 INCIDENTALLY WE MAY BE ABLE TO THROW A LITTLE MORE LIGHT ON ONE OR TWO OF YOUR MINOR ENTANGLEMENTS I DON'T WANT TO THINK OF THEM SAID SIR RICHMOND LET ME GET RIGHT AWAY FROM EVERYTHING UNTIL MY SKIN HAS GROWN AGAIN CHAPTER THE SIXTH

5802-76044-0018 IT LOOKS SIR RICHMOND SAID AS THOUGH SOME OLD GIANTESS HAD LEFT A DISCARDED SET OF TEETH ON THE HILLSIDE FAR MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN STONEHENGE ITSELF WERE THE BARROWS THAT CAPPED THE NEIGHBOURING CRESTS THE SACRED STONES WERE FENCED ABOUT
5802-76044-0019 AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD STOOD A TRAVEL STAINED MIDDLE CLASS AUTOMOBILE WITH A MISCELLANY OF DUSTY LUGGAGE RUGS AND LUNCHEON THINGS THEREIN A FAMILY AUTOMOBILE WITH FATHER NO DOUBT AT THE WHEEL SIR RICHMOND LEFT HIS OWN TRIM COUPE AT ITS TAIL
5802-76044-0020 THEY WERE IMPEDED AT THE ENTRANCE BY A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN THE KEEPER OF THE TURNSTILE AND A SMALL BUT RESOLUTE BOY OF PERHAPS FIVE OR SIX WHO PROPOSED TO LEAVE THE ENCLOSURE

5802-76044-0027 A NURSE APPEARED REMOTELY GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE AEROPLANE SHEDS AND HER CRY OF
5802-76044-0028 SHE WAS A BLACK HAIRED SUN BURNT INDIVIDUAL AND SHE STOOD WITH HER ARMS AKIMBO QUITE FRANKLY AMUSED AT THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MASTER ANTHONY AND OFFERING NO SORT OF HELP FOR HIS RECOVERY
5802-76044-0029 AND ONE OR TWO OTHER FEMININE PERSONALITIES PRODUCED EFFECTS OF MOVEMENT RATHER THAN OF INDIVIDUALITY AS THEY FLITTED AMONG THE STONES
5802-76044-0030 SAID THE LADY IN GREY WITH THAT RISING INTONATION OF HUMOROUS CONCLUSION WHICH IS SO DISTINCTIVELY AMERICAN THOSE DRUIDS HAVE GOT HIM HE'S HIDING SAID THE AUTOMOBILIST
5802-76044-0031 A GREAT BOY WHO IS ALMOST SIX
5802-76044-0032 SAID SIR RICHMOND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE LADY ON THE ROCK RATHER THAN TO THE ANGRY PARENT BELOW HE'S PERFECTLY SAFE AND HAPPY

5802-76044-0035 THE EXCITEMENT ABOUT MASTER ANTHONY COLLAPSED
5802-76044-0036 THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY FOUND SOME DIFFICULTY IT WOULD SEEM IN READJUSTING HIS MIND TO THE COMPARATIVE INNOCENCE OF ANTHONY AND SIR RICHMOND AND THE YOUNG LADY ON THE ROCK SOUGHT AS IF BY COMMON IMPULSE TO ESTABLISH A GENERAL CONVERSATION THERE WERE FAINT TRACES OF EXCITEMENT IN HER MANNER
5802-76044-0037 BUT SHE INSISTS ON DATES

5802-76044-0049 HE WAS NOT VERY GOOD AT FEMININE AGES SHE HAD A CLEAR SUN BROWNED COMPLEXION WITH DARK HAIR AND SMILING LIPS HER FEATURES WERE FINELY MODELLED WITH JUST THAT ADDED TOUCH OF BREADTH IN THE BROW AND SOFTNESS IN THE CHEEK BONES
5802-76044-0050 THAT FAINT FLAVOUR OF THE AMERINDIAN ONE SEES AT TIMES IN AMERICAN WOMEN HER VOICE WAS A VERY SOFT AND PLEASING VOICE
5802-76044-0051 AND WHEN SHE HAD SPOKEN DOCTOR MARTINEAU NOTED THAT SHE LOOKED AT SIR RICHMOND AS IF SHE EXPECTED HIM AT LEAST TO CONFIRM HER VISION SIR RICHMOND WAS EVIDENTLY PREPARED TO CONFIRM IT WITH A QUEER LITTLE TWINGE OF INFRINGED PROPRIETORSHIP
5802-76044-0052 THE DOCTOR SAW SIR RICHMOND STEP UP ON THE PROSTRATE MEGALITH AND STAND BESIDE HER THE BETTER TO APPRECIATE HER POINT OF VIEW HE SMILED DOWN AT HER NOW WHY DO YOU THINK THEY CAME IN THERE HE ASKED
