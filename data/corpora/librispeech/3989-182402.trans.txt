3989-182402-0000 WHY SPOTTY THE TURTLE CARRIES HIS HOUSE WITH HIM SPOTTY THE TURTLE SAT ON AN OLD LOG ON THE BANK OF THE SMILING POOL TAKING A SUN BATH HE HAD SAT THAT WAY FOR THE LONGEST TIME WITHOUT ONCE MOVING
3989-182402-0001 PETER RABBIT HAD SEEN HIM WHEN HE WENT BY ON HIS WAY TO THE LAUGHING BROOK AND THE GREEN FOREST TO LOOK FOR SOME ONE TO PASS THE TIME OF DAY WITH SPOTTY WAS STILL THERE WHEN PETER RETURNED A LONG TIME AFTER AND HE DIDN'T LOOK AS IF HE HAD MOVED
3989-182402-0002 A SUDDEN THOUGHT STRUCK PETER
3989-182402-0003 HE HAD SEEN THE HOUSES OF MOST OF HIS OTHER FRIENDS BUT THINK AS HARD AS EVER HE COULD
3989-182402-0004 HI SPOTTY HE SHOUTED WHERE DO YOU LIVE SPOTTY SLOWLY TURNED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED UP AT PETER THERE WAS A TWINKLE IN HIS EYES THOUGH PETER DIDN'T SEE IT RIGHT HERE IN THE SMILING POOL WHERE ELSE SHOULD I LIVE HE REPLIED
3989-182402-0005 I MEAN WHERE IS YOUR HOUSE RETURNED PETER OF COURSE I KNOW YOU LIVE IN THE SMILING POOL BUT WHERE IS YOUR HOUSE
3989-182402-0006 PETER STARED VERY HARD
3989-182402-0007 HIS HOUSE WAS WITH HIM AND NOW HE HAD SIMPLY RETIRED INSIDE HE DIDN'T NEED ANY OTHER HOUSE THAN JUST THAT HARD SPOTTED SHELL INSIDE OF WHICH HE WAS NOW SO COSILY TUCKED AWAY THAT'S A GREAT IDEA HO HO HO
3989-182402-0008 THAT'S A GREAT IDEA SHOUTED PETER OF COURSE IT IS REPLIED SPOTTY PUTTING NOTHING BUT HIS HEAD OUT YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND ME AT HOME WHENEVER YOU CALL PETER AND THAT IS MORE THAN YOU CAN SAY OF MOST OTHER PEOPLE
3989-182402-0009 ALL THE WAY TO HIS OWN HOME IN THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH PETER THOUGHT ABOUT SPOTTY AND HOW QUEER IT WAS THAT HE SHOULD CARRY HIS HOUSE AROUND WITH HIM I WONDER HOW IT HAPPENS THAT HE DOES IT THOUGHT HE NO WONDER HE IS SO SLOW
3989-182402-0010 OF COURSE IT IS VERY HANDY TO HAVE HIS HOUSE ALWAYS WITH HIM AS HE SAYS HE IS ALWAYS AT HOME STILL WHEN HE IS IN A HURRY TO GET AWAY FROM AN ENEMY IT MUST BE VERY AWKWARD TO HAVE TO CARRY HIS HOUSE ON HIS BACK I I
3989-182402-0011 WHY HOW STUPID OF ME HE DOESN'T HAVE TO RUN AWAY AT ALL ALL HE HAS GOT TO DO IS TO GO INSIDE HIS HOUSE AND STAY THERE UNTIL THE DANGER IS PAST I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE WHY THAT IS THE HANDIEST THING I EVER HEARD OF
3989-182402-0012 NOW PETER KNEW THAT THERE MUST BE A GOOD STORY ABOUT SPOTTY AND HIS HOUSE AND YOU KNOW PETER DEARLY LOVES A GOOD STORY SO AT THE VERY FIRST OPPORTUNITY THE NEXT DAY HE HURRIED OVER TO THE SMILING POOL TO ASK GRANDFATHER FROG ABOUT IT
3989-182402-0013 AS USUAL GRANDFATHER FROG WAS SITTING ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY PAD NO SOONER DID PETER POP HIS HEAD ABOVE THE EDGE OF THE BANK OF THE SMILING POOL THAN GRANDFATHER FROG EXCLAIMED CHUG A RUM YOU'VE KEPT ME WAITING A LONG TIME PETER RABBIT
3989-182402-0014 I DON'T LIKE TO BE KEPT WAITING IF YOU WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SPOTTY THE TURTLE WHY DIDN'T YOU COME EARLIER ALL THE TIME THERE WAS A TWINKLE IN THE BIG GOGGLY EYES OF GRANDFATHER FROG
3989-182402-0015 HE HADN'T SAID A WORD TO ANY ONE ABOUT SPOTTY SO HOW COULD GRANDFATHER FROG KNOW WHAT HE HAD COME FOR FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD HAD A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR GRANDFATHER FROG WHO AS YOU KNOW IS VERY OLD AND VERY WISE
3989-182402-0016 BUT NOW PETER FELT ALMOST AFRAID OF HIM YOU SEE IT SEEMED TO PETER AS IF GRANDFATHER FROG HAD READ HIS VERY THOUGHTS I I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE WAITING TRULY I DIDN'T STAMMERED PETER
3989-182402-0017 IF YOU PLEASE HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT I WAS COMING AND WHAT I WAS COMING FOR NEVER MIND HOW I KNEW I KNOW A GREAT DEAL THAT I DON'T TELL WHICH IS MORE THAN SOME FOLKS CAN SAY REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG
3989-182402-0018 PETER WONDERED IF HE MEANT HIM FOR YOU KNOW PETER IS A GREAT GOSSIP BUT HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW JUST WHAT TO SAY AND IN A MINUTE GRANDFATHER FROG BEGAN THE STORY PETER SO MUCH WANTED
3989-182402-0019 OF COURSE YOU KNOW WITHOUT ME TELLING YOU THAT THERE IS A REASON FOR SPOTTY'S CARRYING HIS HOUSE AROUND WITH HIM BECAUSE THERE IS A REASON FOR EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT THAT REASON IS BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO
3989-182402-0020 WAY BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG ALMOST EVERYTHING TO DAY IS THE RESULT OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THOSE LONG AGO DAYS THE GREAT GREAT EVER SO GREAT GRANDFATHER OF SPOTTY THE TURTLE LIVED THEN AND UNLIKE SPOTTY WHOM YOU KNOW
3989-182402-0021 HE HAD NO HOUSE HE WAS VERY QUIET AND BASHFUL WAS MISTER TURTLE AND HE NEVER MEDDLED WITH ANY ONE'S BUSINESS BECAUSE HE BELIEVED THAT THE BEST WAY OF KEEPING OUT OF TROUBLE WAS TO ATTEND STRICTLY TO HIS OWN AFFAIRS
3989-182402-0022 HE WAS A GOOD DEAL LIKE SPOTTY JUST AS FOND OF THE WATER AND JUST AS SLOW MOVING BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE THE HOUSE WHICH SPOTTY HAS NOW IF HE HAD HAD HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE AND WORRY
3989-182402-0023 FOR A LONG TIME EVERYBODY LIVED AT PEACE WITH EVERYBODY ELSE THEN CAME THE TRYING TIME OF WHICH YOU ALREADY KNOW WHEN THOSE WHO LIVED ON THE GREEN MEADOWS AND IN THE GREEN FOREST HAD THE VERY HARDEST KIND OF WORK TO FIND ENOUGH TO EAT
3989-182402-0024 AND WERE HUNGRY MOST OF THE TIME NOW MISTER TURTLE LIVING IN THE SMILING POOL HAD PLENTY TO EAT HE HAD NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT ON THAT SCORE EVERYBODY WHO LIVES IN THE SMILING POOL KNOWS THAT IT IS THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD ANYWAY
3989-182402-0025 GRANDFATHER FROG WINKED AT JERRY MUSKRAT WHO WAS LISTENING AND JERRY NODDED HIS HEAD
3989-182402-0026 AND THAT HE WASN'T SAFE A MINUTE WHEN ON SHORE AND NOT ALWAYS SAFE IN THE WATER CONTINUED GRANDFATHER FROG HE HAD TWO OR THREE VERY NARROW ESCAPES AND THESE SET HIM TO THINKING HE WAS TOO SLOW AND AWKWARD TO RUN OR TO FIGHT
3989-182402-0027 THE ONLY THING HE COULD DO WAS TO KEEP OUT OF SIGHT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO HE LEARNED TO SWIM WITH ONLY HIS HEAD OUT OF WATER AND SOMETIMES WITH ONLY THE END OF HIS NOSE OUT OF WATER
3989-182402-0028 WHEN HE WENT ON LAND HE WOULD COVER HIMSELF WITH MUD AND THEN WHEN HE HEARD ANYBODY COMING HE WOULD LIE PERFECTLY STILL WITH HIS LEGS AND HIS TAIL AND HIS HEAD DRAWN IN JUST AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE
3989-182402-0029 ONE DAY HE HAD CRAWLED UNDER A PIECE OF BARK TO REST
3989-182402-0030 WHEN HE GOT READY TO GO ON HIS WAY HE FOUND THAT THE PIECE OF BARK HAD CAUGHT ON HIS BACK
3989-182402-0031 AT FIRST HE WAS ANNOYED AND STARTED TO SHAKE IT OFF BEFORE HE SUCCEEDED HE HEARD SOMEONE COMING
3989-182402-0032 IT WAS MISTER FISHER AND HE WAS VERY HUNGRY AND FIERCE HE LOOKED AT THE PIECE OF BARK UNDER WHICH MISTER TURTLE WAS HIDING BUT ALL HE SAW WAS THE BARK BECAUSE YOU KNOW MISTER TURTLE HAD DRAWN HIMSELF WHOLLY UNDER I BELIEVE
3989-182402-0033 SAID MISTER FISHER TALKING OUT LOUD TO HIMSELF THAT I'LL HAVE A LOOK AROUND THE SMILING POOL AND SEE IF I CAN CATCH THAT SLOW MOVING TURTLE WHO LIVES THERE I BELIEVE HE'LL MAKE ME A GOOD DINNER OF COURSE MISTER TURTLE HEARD JUST WHAT HE SAID
3989-182402-0034 AND HE BLESSED THE PIECE OF BARK WHICH HAD HIDDEN HIM FROM MISTER FISHER'S SIGHT FOR A LONG TIME HE LAY VERY STILL WHEN HE DID GO ON HE TOOK THE GREATEST CARE NOT TO SHAKE OFF THAT PIECE OF BARK FOR HE DIDN'T KNOW BUT THAT ANY MINUTE HE MIGHT WANT TO HIDE UNDER IT AGAIN
3989-182402-0035 AT LAST HE REACHED THE SMILING POOL AND SLIPPED INTO THE WATER LEAVING THE PIECE OF BARK ON THE BANK THEREAFTER WHEN HE WANTED TO GO ON LAND HE WOULD FIRST MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE WAS WATCHING THEN HE WOULD CRAWL UNDER THE PIECE OF BARK AND GET IT ON HIS BACK
3989-182402-0036 WHEREVER HE WENT HE CARRIED THE PIECE OF BARK SO AS TO HAVE IT HANDY TO HIDE UNDER NOW ALL THIS TIME OLD MOTHER NATURE HAD BEEN WATCHING MISTER TURTLE AND IT PLEASED HER TO SEE THAT HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO THINK OF SUCH A CLEVER WAY OF FOOLING HIS ENEMIES
3989-182402-0037 SO SHE BEGAN TO STUDY HOW SHE COULD HELP MISTER TURTLE ONE DAY SHE CAME UP BEHIND HIM JUST AS HE SAT DOWN TO REST THE PIECE OF BARK WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND SCRATCHED HIS BACK I WISH SAID HE TALKING TO HIMSELF
3989-182402-0038 FOR HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT ANY ONE ELSE WAS NEAR I WISH THAT I HAD A HOUSE OF MY OWN THAT I COULD CARRY ON MY BACK ALL THE TIME AND BE PERFECTLY SAFE WHEN I WAS INSIDE OF IT YOU SHALL HAVE SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE AND REACHING OUT
3989-182402-0039 SHE TOUCHED HIS BACK AND TURNED THE SKIN INTO HARD SHELL THEN SHE TOUCHED THE SKIN OF HIS STOMACH AND TURNED THAT INTO HARD SHELL NOW DRAW IN YOUR HEAD AND YOUR LEGS AND YOUR TAIL SAID SHE MISTER TURTLE DID AS HE WAS TOLD TO DO
3989-182402-0040 AND THERE HE WAS IN THE VERY BEST AND SAFEST KIND OF A HOUSE PERFECTLY HIDDEN FROM ALL HIS ENEMIES OH MOTHER NATURE HOW CAN I EVER THANK YOU HE CRIED BY DOING AS YOU ALWAYS HAVE DONE ATTENDING WHOLLY TO YOUR OWN AFFAIRS
3989-182402-0041 REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE SO EVER SINCE THAT LONG AGO DAY WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG ALL TURTLES HAVE CARRIED THEIR HOUSES WITH THEM AND NEVER HAVE MEDDLED IN THINGS THAT DON'T CONCERN THEM CONCLUDED GRANDFATHER FROG
3989-182402-0042 OH THANK YOU GRANDFATHER FROG EXCLAIMED PETER DRAWING A LONG BREATH THAT WAS A PERFECTLY SPLENDID THING FOR OLD MOTHER NATURE TO DO THEN HE STARTED FOR HIS OWN HOME IN THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH
3989-182402-0043 AND ALL THE WAY THERE HE WONDERED AND WONDERED HOW GRANDFATHER FROG KNEW THAT HE WANTED THAT STORY AND TO THIS DAY HE HASN'T FOUND OUT YOU SEE HE DIDN'T NOTICE THAT GRANDFATHER FROG WAS LISTENING WHEN HE ASKED SPOTTY ABOUT HIS HOUSE
