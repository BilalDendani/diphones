5375-40162-0002 AND HIS REMARKABLE PORTRAYAL OF THE ILL FATED PRINCE OF DENMARK WAS SOMETHING LONG TO BE REMEMBERED BY THE THREE GIRLS AS WELL AS BY THE REST OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC ASSEMBLAGE THAT WITNESSED IT I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE AWFUL LOOK IN HIS POOR EYES SAID GRACE SOLEMNLY

5375-40162-0004 HIS OWN PERSONALITY WAS COMPLETELY SUBMERGED IN THAT OF THE MELANCHOLY GHOST RIDDEN YOUTH WHO DEDICATING HIS LIFE TO THE PURPOSE OF AVENGING HIS FATHER'S MURDER WELCOMED DEATH WITH OPEN ARMS WHEN HIS PURPOSE HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED SHE HAD SEEN A GREAT PLAY AND A GREAT ACTOR

5375-40162-0035 I HAVE ORDERED DINNER FOR SIX O'CLOCK EATING DINNER IN A DRESSING ROOM WAS AN INNOVATION AS FAR AS GRACE AND MIRIAM WERE CONCERNED

5375-40162-0039 WHICH SO OFTEN HUMILIATE AND EMBITTER THE LESSER LIGHTS OF A THEATRICAL COMPANY AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THEY SAID GOOD BYE TO THE ACTOR THROUGH THE COURTESY OF MISTER FOREST THEY WERE TO WITNESS A PLAY IN WHICH A WONDERFUL LITTLE GIRL OF FIFTEEN

5375-40162-0050 THE EARLY WINTER DARKNESS WAS FALLING WHEN THE THREE GIRLS HURRIED UP THE STAIRS AT WAYNE HALL AS FAST AS THE WEIGHT OF THEIR SUIT CASES WOULD PERMIT MIRIAM'S DOOR WAS CLOSED SHE KNOCKED ON IT AT FIRST SOFTLY THEN WITH MORE FORCE
5375-40162-0051 HEARING NO SOUND FROM WITHIN SHE TURNED THE KNOB FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR AND STEPPED INSIDE
