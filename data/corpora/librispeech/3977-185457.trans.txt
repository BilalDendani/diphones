3977-185457-0000 CHAPTER SIX POLLEN OR BEE BREAD THIS SUBSTANCE IS GATHERED BY THE BEES FROM THE FLOWERS OR BLOSSOMS AND IS USED FOR THE NOURISHMENT OF THEIR YOUNG
3977-185457-0001 REPEATED EXPERIMENTS HAVE PROVED THAT NO BROOD CAN BE RAISED IN A HIVE UNLESS THE BEES ARE SUPPLIED WITH IT IT CONTAINS NONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF WAX BUT IS RICH IN WHAT CHEMISTS CALL NITROGENOUS SUBSTANCES
3977-185457-0002 WHICH ARE NOT CONTAINED IN HONEY AND WHICH FURNISH AMPLE NOURISHMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GROWING BEE DOCTOR HUNTER DISSECTED SOME IMMATURE BEES AND FOUND THEIR STOMACHS TO CONTAIN FARINA BUT NOT A PARTICLE OF HONEY
3977-185457-0003 WE ARE INDEBTED TO HUBER FOR THE DISCOVERY OF THE USE MADE BY THE BEES OF POLLEN THAT IT DID NOT SERVE AS FOOD FOR THE MATURE BEES
3977-185457-0004 WAS EVIDENT FROM THE FACT THAT LARGE SUPPLIES ARE OFTEN FOUND IN HIVES WHOSE INMATES HAVE STARVED TO DEATH IT WAS THIS FACT WHICH LED THE OLD OBSERVERS TO CONCLUDE THAT IT WAS GATHERED FOR THE PURPOSE OF BUILDING COMB
3977-185457-0005 AFTER HUBER HAD DEMONSTRATED THAT WAX IS SECRETED FROM AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SUBSTANCE HE WAS SOON LED TO CONJECTURE THAT THE BEE BREAD MUST BE USED FOR THE NOURISHMENT OF THE EMBRYO BEES
3977-185457-0006 BY RIGID EXPERIMENTS HE PROVED THE TRUTH OF THIS SUPPOSITION BEES WERE CONFINED TO THEIR HIVE WITHOUT ANY POLLEN AFTER BEING SUPPLIED WITH HONEY EGGS AND LARVAE IN A SHORT TIME THE YOUNG ALL PERISHED
3977-185457-0007 A FRESH SUPPLY OF BROOD WAS GIVEN TO THEM WITH AN AMPLE ALLOWANCE OF POLLEN AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LARVAE THEN PROCEEDED IN THE NATURAL WAY WHEN A COLONY IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN CARRYING IN THIS ARTICLE
3977-185457-0008 IT MAY BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT THEY HAVE A FERTILE QUEEN AND ARE BUSY IN BREEDING ON THE CONTRARY
3977-185457-0009 THE QUEEN IS EITHER DEAD OR DISEASED AND THE HIVE SHOULD AT ONCE BE EXAMINED IN THE BACKWARD SPRING OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO I HAD AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY OF TESTING THE VALUE OF THIS SUBSTANCE IN ONE OF MY HIVES
3977-185457-0010 WAS AN ARTIFICIAL SWARM OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR THE HIVE WAS WELL PROTECTED BEING DOUBLE AND THE SITUATION WAS WARM I OPENED IT ON THE FIFTH OF FEBRUARY AND ALTHOUGH THE WEATHER UNTIL WITHIN A WEEK OF THAT TIME
3977-185457-0011 HAD BEEN UNUSUALLY COLD I FOUND MANY OF THE CELLS FILLED WITH BROOD
3977-185457-0012 BROOD NOR BEE BREAD THE BEES WERE THEN SUPPLIED WITH BEE BREAD TAKEN FROM ANOTHER HIVE THE NEXT DAY THIS WAS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN USED BY THEM AND A LARGE NUMBER OF EGGS HAD BEEN DEPOSITED IN THE CELLS
3977-185457-0013 WHEN THIS SUPPLY WAS EXHAUSTED EGG LAYING CEASED AND WAS AGAIN RENEWED WHEN MORE WAS FURNISHED THEM DURING ALL THE TIME OF THESE EXPERIMENTS THE WEATHER WAS UNPROMISING
3977-185457-0014 AND AS THE BEES WERE UNABLE TO GO OUT FOR WATER THEY WERE SUPPLIED AT HOME WITH THIS IMPORTANT ARTICLE DZIERZON IS OF OPINION THAT THE BEES ARE ABLE TO FURNISH FOOD FOR THE YOUNG WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF POLLEN IN THE HIVE
3977-185457-0015 ALTHOUGH HE ADMITS THAT THEY CAN DO THIS ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME AND AT A GREAT EXPENSE OF VITAL ENERGY JUST AS THE STRENGTH OF AN ANIMAL NURSING ITS YOUNG IS RAPIDLY REDUCED WHEN FOR WANT OF PROPER FOOD
3977-185457-0016 WITHOUT VERY SEVERELY TAXING THEIR STRENGTH BUT AS ALL THE ELEMENTS OF WAX ARE FOUND IN HONEY AND NONE OF THEM IN POLLEN THIS OPINION DOES NOT SEEM TO ME TO BE ENTITLED TO MUCH WEIGHT
3977-185457-0017 THAT BEES CANNOT LIVE UPON POLLEN WITHOUT ANY HONEY IS PROVED BY THE FACT THAT LARGE STORES OF IT ARE OFTEN FOUND IN HIVES WHOSE OCCUPANTS HAVE DIED OF STARVATION THAT THEY CAN LIVE WITHOUT IT
3977-185457-0018 IS EQUALLY WELL KNOWN BUT THAT THE FULL GROWN BEES MAKE SOME USE OF IT IN CONNECTION WITH HONEY FOR THEIR OWN NOURISHMENT I BELIEVE TO BE HIGHLY PROBABLE THE BEES PREFER TO GATHER FRESH BEE BREAD
3977-185457-0019 EVEN WHEN THERE ARE LARGE ACCUMULATIONS OF OLD STORES IN THE CELLS HENCE THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF BEING ABLE TO MAKE THE SURPLUS OF OLD COLONIES SUPPLY THE DEFICIENCY OF YOUNG ONES
3977-185457-0020 ON THE ADVANTAGES WHICH OUGHT TO BE FOUND IN AN IMPROVED HIVE IF BOTH HONEY AND POLLEN CAN BE OBTAINED FROM THE SAME FLOWER THEN A LOAD OF EACH WILL BE SECURED BY THE INDUSTRIOUS INSECT OF THIS ANY ONE MAY CONVINCE HIMSELF
3977-185457-0021 THAT A BEE IN GATHERING POLLEN ALWAYS CONFINES HERSELF TO THE SAME KIND OF FLOWER ON WHICH SHE BEGINS EVEN WHEN THAT IS NOT SO ABUNDANT AS SOME OTHERS THUS IF YOU EXAMINE A BALL OF THIS SUBSTANCE TAKEN FROM HER THIGH
3977-185457-0022 IT IS FOUND TO BE OF ONE UNIFORM COLOR THROUGHOUT THE LOAD OF ONE WILL BE YELLOW ANOTHER RED AND A THIRD BROWN THE COLOR VARYING ACCORDING TO THAT OF THE PLANT FROM WHICH IT WAS OBTAINED
3977-185457-0023 IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE POLLEN OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF FLOWERS WOULD NOT PACK SO WELL TOGETHER IT IS CERTAIN THAT IF THEY FLEW FROM ONE SPECIES TO ANOTHER THERE WOULD BE A MUCH GREATER MIXTURE OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES THAN THERE NOW IS
3977-185457-0024 FOR THEY CARRY ON THEIR BODIES THE POLLEN OR FERTILIZING PRINCIPLE AND THUS AID MOST POWERFULLY IN THE IMPREGNATION OF PLANTS THIS IS ONE REASON WHY IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO PRESERVE PURE
3977-185457-0025 I CANNOT RESIST THE IMPRESSION THAT THE HONEY BEE WAS MADE FOR THE ESPECIAL SERVICE AND INSTRUCTION OF MAN AT FIRST THE IMPORTANCE OF ITS PRODUCTS WHEN HONEY WAS THE ONLY NATURAL SWEET
3977-185457-0026 SERVED MOST POWERFULLY TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION TO ITS CURIOUS HABITS AND NOW SINCE THE CULTIVATION OF THE SUGAR CANE HAS DIMINISHED THE RELATIVE VALUE OF ITS LUSCIOUS SWEETS
3977-185457-0027 SPEAKS OF THEM AS HAVING RECEIVED A DIRECT EMANATION FROM THE DIVINE INTELLIGENCE AND MANY MODERN APIARIANS ARE ALMOST DISPOSED TO RANK THE BEE FOR SAGACITY AS NEXT IN THE SCALE OF CREATION TO MAN
3977-185457-0028 HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN AND OF LATE SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO FURNISH A SUBSTITUTE
3977-185457-0029 THEY LABOR AT THIS WORK WITH ASTONISHING INDUSTRY AND SEEM DECIDEDLY TO PREFER THE MEAL TO THE OLD POLLEN STORED IN THEIR COMBS BY THIS MEANS THE BEES ARE INDUCED TO COMMENCE BREEDING EARLY AND RAPIDLY RECRUIT THEIR NUMBERS
3977-185457-0030 THE FEEDING IS CONTINUED TILL THE BEES CEASE TO CARRY AWAY THE MEAL THAT IS UNTIL THE NATURAL SUPPLIES FURNISH THEM WITH A PREFERABLE ARTICLE THE AVERAGE CONSUMPTION OF EACH COLONY IS ABOUT TWO POUNDS OF MEAL
3977-185457-0031 AT THE LAST ANNUAL APIARIAN CONVENTION IN GERMANY A CULTIVATOR RECOMMENDED WHEAT FLOUR AS AN EXCELLENT SUBSTITUTE FOR POLLEN HE SAYS THAT IN FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO HE USED IT WITH THE BEST RESULTS
3977-185457-0032 THE BEES FORSOOK THE HONEY WHICH HAD BEEN SET OUT FOR THEM AND ENGAGED ACTIVELY IN CARRYING IN LARGE QUANTITIES OF THE WHEAT FLOUR WHICH WAS PLACED ABOUT TWENTY PACES IN FRONT OF THE HIVES THE CONSTRUCTION OF MY HIVES
3977-185457-0033 PERMITS THE FLOUR TO BE PLACED AT ONCE WHERE THE BEES CAN TAKE IT WITHOUT BEING COMPELLED TO WASTE THEIR TIME IN GOING OUT FOR IT OR TO SUFFER FOR THE WANT OF IT WHEN THE WEATHER CONFINES THEM AT HOME
3977-185457-0034 THE DISCOVERY OF THIS SUBSTITUTE REMOVES A SERIOUS OBSTACLE TO THE SUCCESSFUL CULTURE OF BEES IN MANY DISTRICTS THERE IS A GREAT ABUNDANCE OF HONEY FOR A FEW WEEKS IN THE SEASON AND ALMOST ANY NUMBER OF COLONIES
3977-185457-0035 THE SUPPLY OF POLLEN IS OFTEN SO INSUFFICIENT THAT THE NEW COLONIES OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR ARE FOUND DESTITUTE OF THIS ARTICLE IN THE SPRING AND UNLESS THE SEASON IS EARLY AND THE WEATHER UNUSUALLY FAVORABLE
