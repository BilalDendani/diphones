2827-170438-0000 LIKE A SERVANT OF THE LORD WITH HIS BIBLE AND HIS SWORD OUR GENERAL RODE ALONG US TO FORM US FOR THE FIGHT MACAULAY
2827-170438-0001 THE CIVIL WAR HAS LEFT AS ALL WARS OF BROTHER AGAINST BROTHER MUST LEAVE TERRIBLE AND HEARTRENDING MEMORIES
2827-170438-0002 BUT THERE REMAINS AS AN OFFSET THE GLORY WHICH HAS ACCRUED TO THE NATION BY THE COUNTLESS DEEDS OF HEROISM PERFORMED BY BOTH SIDES IN THE STRUGGLE THE CAPTAINS AND THE ARMIES THAT AFTER LONG YEARS OF DREARY CAMPAIGNING AND BLOODY STUBBORN FIGHTING
2827-170438-0003 BROUGHT THE WAR TO A CLOSE HAVE LEFT US MORE THAN A REUNITED REALM NORTH AND SOUTH ALL AMERICANS NOW HAVE A COMMON FUND OF GLORIOUS MEMORIES WE ARE THE RICHER FOR EACH GRIM CAMPAIGN FOR EACH HARD FOUGHT BATTLE
2827-170438-0004 WE ARE THE RICHER FOR VALOR DISPLAYED ALIKE BY THOSE WHO FOUGHT SO VALIANTLY FOR THE RIGHT AND BY THOSE WHO NO LESS VALIANTLY FOUGHT FOR WHAT THEY DEEMED THE RIGHT WE HAVE IN US NOBLER CAPACITIES FOR WHAT IS GREAT AND GOOD
2827-170438-0005 BECAUSE OF THE INFINITE WOE AND SUFFERING AND BECAUSE OF THE SPLENDID ULTIMATE TRIUMPH WE HOLD THAT IT WAS VITAL TO THE WELFARE NOT ONLY OF OUR PEOPLE ON THIS CONTINENT BUT OF THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE
2827-170438-0006 THAT THE UNION SHOULD BE PRESERVED AND SLAVERY ABOLISHED THAT ONE FLAG SHOULD FLY FROM THE GREAT LAKES TO THE RIO GRANDE THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE FREE IN FACT AS WELL AS IN NAME AND THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD STAND AS ONE NATION
2827-170438-0007 THE GREATEST NATION ON THE EARTH BUT WE RECOGNIZE GLADLY THAT SOUTH AS WELL AS NORTH WHEN THE FIGHT WAS ONCE ON THE LEADERS OF THE ARMIES AND THE SOLDIERS WHOM THEY LED DISPLAYED THE SAME QUALITIES OF DARING AND STEADFAST COURAGE
2827-170438-0008 OF DISINTERESTED LOYALTY AND ENTHUSIASM AND OF HIGH DEVOTION TO AN IDEAL THE GREATEST GENERAL OF THE SOUTH WAS LEE AND HIS GREATEST LIEUTENANT WAS JACKSON BOTH WERE VIRGINIANS AND BOTH WERE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO DISUNION
2827-170438-0009 LEE WENT SO FAR AS TO DENY THE RIGHT OF SECESSION WHILE JACKSON INSISTED THAT THE SOUTH OUGHT TO TRY TO GET ITS RIGHTS INSIDE THE UNION AND NOT OUTSIDE BUT WHEN VIRGINIA JOINED THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY AND THE WAR HAD ACTUALLY BEGUN
2827-170438-0010 BOTH MEN CAST THEIR LOT WITH THE SOUTH IT IS OFTEN SAID THAT THE CIVIL WAR WAS IN ONE SENSE A REPETITION OF THE OLD STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE PURITAN AND THE CAVALIER BUT PURITAN AND CAVALIER TYPES WERE COMMON TO THE TWO ARMIES
2827-170438-0011 IN DASH AND LIGHT HEARTED DARING CUSTER AND KEARNEY STOOD AS CONSPICUOUS AS STUART AND MORGAN AND ON THE OTHER HAND NO NORTHERN GENERAL APPROACHED THE ROUNDHEAD TYPE THE TYPE OF THE STERN RELIGIOUS WARRIORS WHO FOUGHT UNDER CROMWELL
2827-170438-0012 SO CLOSELY AS STONEWALL JACKSON HE WAS A MAN OF INTENSE RELIGIOUS CONVICTION WHO CARRIED INTO EVERY THOUGHT AND DEED OF HIS DAILY LIFE THE PRECEPTS OF THE FAITH HE CHERISHED HE WAS A TENDER AND LOVING HUSBAND AND FATHER
2827-170438-0013 YET IN THE TIMES THAT TRIED MEN'S SOULS HE PROVED NOT ONLY A COMMANDER OF GENIUS BUT A FIGHTER OF IRON WILL AND TEMPER WHO JOYED IN THE BATTLE AND ALWAYS SHOWED AT HIS BEST WHEN THE DANGER WAS GREATEST
2827-170438-0014 THE VEIN OF FANATICISM THAT RAN THROUGH HIS CHARACTER HELPED TO RENDER HIM A TERRIBLE OPPONENT HE KNEW NO SUCH WORD AS FALTER AND WHEN HE HAD ONCE PUT HIS HAND TO A PIECE OF WORK HE DID IT THOROUGHLY AND WITH ALL HIS HEART
2827-170438-0015 IT WAS QUITE IN KEEPING WITH HIS CHARACTER THAT THIS GENTLE HIGH MINDED AND RELIGIOUS MAN SHOULD EARLY IN THE CONTEST HAVE PROPOSED TO HOIST THE BLACK FLAG NEITHER TAKE NOR GIVE QUARTER AND MAKE THE WAR ONE OF EXTERMINATION
2827-170438-0016 NO SUCH POLICY WAS PRACTICAL IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND IN THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC BUT IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED QUITE NATURAL AND PROPER TO JACKSON'S ANCESTORS THE GRIM SCOTCH IRISH WHO DEFENDED LONDONDERRY AGAINST THE FORCES OF THE STUART KING
2827-170438-0017 OR TO THEIR FOREFATHERS THE COVENANTERS OF SCOTLAND
2827-170438-0018 FROM THAT TIME UNTIL HIS DEATH LESS THAN TWO YEARS AFTERWARD HIS CAREER WAS ONE OF BRILLIANT AND ALMOST UNINTERRUPTED SUCCESS WHETHER SERVING WITH AN INDEPENDENT COMMAND IN THE VALLEY
2827-170438-0019 OR ACTING UNDER LEE AS HIS RIGHT ARM IN THE PITCHED BATTLES WITH MC CLELLAN POPE AND BURNSIDE FEW GENERALS AS GREAT AS LEE HAVE EVER HAD AS GREAT A LIEUTENANT AS JACKSON HE WAS A MASTER OF STRATEGY AND TACTICS
2827-170438-0020 FEARLESS OF RESPONSIBILITY ABLE TO INSTIL INTO HIS MEN HIS OWN INTENSE ARDOR IN BATTLE AND SO QUICK IN HIS MOVEMENTS SO READY TO MARCH AS WELL AS FIGHT THAT HIS TROOPS WERE KNOWN TO THE REST OF THE ARMY AS THE FOOT CAVALRY
2827-170438-0021 IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE HOOKER HAD COMMAND OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC LIKE MC CLELLAN HE WAS ABLE TO PERFECT THE DISCIPLINE OF HIS FORCES AND TO ORGANIZE THEM AND AS A DIVISION COMMANDER HE WAS BETTER THAN MC CLELLAN
2827-170438-0022 BUT HE FAILED EVEN MORE SIGNALLY WHEN GIVEN A GREAT INDEPENDENT COMMAND HE HAD UNDER HIM ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND MEN WHEN TOWARD THE END OF APRIL HE PREPARED TO ATTACK LEE'S ARMY WHICH WAS BUT HALF AS STRONG
2827-170438-0023 THE UNION ARMY LAY OPPOSITE FREDERICKSBURG LOOKING AT THE FORTIFIED HEIGHTS WHERE THEY HAD RECEIVED SO BLOODY A REPULSE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WINTER
2827-170438-0024 HOOKER DECIDED TO DISTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE CONFEDERATES BY LETTING A SMALL PORTION OF HIS FORCE UNDER GENERAL SEDGWICK ATTACK FREDERICKSBURG WHILE HE HIMSELF TOOK THE BULK OF THE ARMY ACROSS THE RIVER TO THE RIGHT HAND
2827-170438-0025 SO AS TO CRUSH LEE BY AN ASSAULT ON HIS FLANK ALL WENT WELL AT THE BEGINNING AND ON THE FIRST OF MAY HOOKER FOUND HIMSELF AT CHANCELLORSVILLE FACE TO FACE WITH THE BULK OF LEE'S FORCES AND SEDGWICK CROSSING THE RIVER AND CHARGING WITH THE UTMOST DETERMINATION
2827-170438-0026 HAD DRIVEN OUT OF FREDERICKSBURG THE CONFEDERATE DIVISION OF EARLY BUT WHEN HOOKER FOUND HIMSELF IN FRONT OF LEE HE HESITATED FALTERED INSTEAD OF PUSHING ON AND ALLOWED THE CONSUMMATE GENERAL TO WHOM HE WAS OPPOSED TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE
2827-170438-0027 LEE FULLY REALIZED HIS DANGER AND SAW THAT HIS ONLY CHANCE WAS FIRST TO BEAT BACK HOOKER AND THEN TO TURN AND OVERWHELM SEDGWICK WHO WAS IN HIS REAR
2827-170438-0028 HE CONSULTED WITH JACKSON AND JACKSON BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO MAKE ONE OF HIS FAVORITE FLANK ATTACKS UPON THE UNION ARMY ATTACKS WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED ONLY BY A SKILLED AND RESOLUTE GENERAL AND BY TROOPS EQUALLY ABLE TO MARCH AND TO FIGHT
2827-170438-0029 LEE CONSENTED AND JACKSON AT ONCE MADE OFF THE COUNTRY WAS THICKLY COVERED WITH A FOREST OF RATHER SMALL GROWTH FOR IT WAS A WILD REGION IN WHICH THERE WAS STILL PLENTY OF GAME
2827-170438-0030 SHIELDED BY THE FOREST JACKSON MARCHED HIS GRAY COLUMNS RAPIDLY TO THE LEFT ALONG THE NARROW COUNTRY ROADS UNTIL HE WAS SQUARE ON THE FLANK OF THE UNION RIGHT WING WHICH WAS HELD BY THE ELEVENTH CORPS UNDER HOWARD
2827-170438-0031 THE UNION SCOUTS GOT TRACK OF THE MOVEMENT AND REPORTED IT AT HEADQUARTERS BUT THE UNION GENERALS THOUGHT THE CONFEDERATES WERE RETREATING AND WHEN FINALLY THE SCOUTS BROUGHT WORD TO HOWARD THAT HE WAS MENACED BY A FLANK ATTACK HE PAID NO HEED TO THE INFORMATION
2827-170438-0032 AND ACTUALLY LET HIS WHOLE CORPS BE SURPRISED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT YET ALL THE WHILE THE BATTLE WAS GOING ON ELSEWHERE AND BERDAN'S SHARPSHOOTERS HAD SURROUNDED AND CAPTURED A GEORGIA REGIMENT
2827-170438-0033 FROM WHICH INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED SHOWING DEFINITELY THAT JACKSON WAS NOT RETREATING AND MUST BE PREPARING TO STRIKE A HEAVY BLOW THE ELEVENTH CORPS HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA THAT IT WAS ABOUT TO BE ASSAILED
2827-170438-0034 THE MEN WERE NOT EVEN IN LINE MANY OF THEM HAD STACKED THEIR MUSKETS AND WERE LOUNGING ABOUT SOME PLAYING CARDS OTHERS COOKING SUPPER INTERMINGLED WITH THE PACK MULES AND BEEF CATTLE
2827-170438-0035 WHILE THEY WERE THUS UTTERLY UNPREPARED JACKSON'S GRAY CLAD VETERANS PUSHED STRAIGHT THROUGH THE FOREST AND RUSHED FIERCELY TO THE ATTACK THE FIRST NOTICE THE TROOPS OF THE ELEVENTH CORPS RECEIVED DID NOT COME FROM THE PICKETS BUT FROM THE DEER RABBITS AND FOXES WHICH
2827-170438-0036 FLEEING FROM THEIR COVERTS AT THE APPROACH OF THE CONFEDERATES SUDDENLY CAME RUNNING OVER AND INTO THE UNION LINES IN ANOTHER MINUTE THE FRIGHTENED PICKETS CAME TUMBLING BACK AND RIGHT BEHIND THEM CAME THE LONG FILES OF CHARGING YELLING CONFEDERATES
2827-170438-0037 WITH ONE FIERCE RUSH JACKSON'S MEN SWEPT OVER THE UNION LINES AND AT A BLOW THE ELEVENTH CORPS BECAME A HORDE OF PANICSTRUCK FUGITIVES SOME OF THE REGIMENTS RESISTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN THEY TOO WERE CARRIED AWAY IN THE FLIGHT
2827-170438-0038 FOR A WHILE IT SEEMED AS IF THE WHOLE ARMY WOULD BE SWEPT OFF BUT HOOKER AND HIS SUBORDINATES EXERTED EVERY EFFORT TO RESTORE ORDER IT WAS IMPERATIVE TO GAIN TIME SO THAT THE UNTOUCHED PORTIONS OF THE ARMY COULD FORM ACROSS THE LINE OF THE CONFEDERATE ADVANCE
2827-170438-0039 KEENAN'S REGIMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY BUT FOUR HUNDRED SABERS STRONG WAS ACCORDINGLY SENT FULL AGAINST THE FRONT OF THE TEN THOUSAND VICTORIOUS CONFEDERATES KEENAN HIMSELF FELL PIERCED BY BAYONETS
2827-170438-0040 AND THE CHARGE WAS REPULSED AT ONCE BUT A FEW PRICELESS MOMENTS HAD BEEN SAVED AND PLEASANTON HAD BEEN GIVEN TIME TO POST TWENTY TWO GUNS LOADED WITH DOUBLE CANISTER WHERE THEY WOULD BEAR UPON THE ENEMY
2827-170438-0041 THE CONFEDERATES ADVANCED IN A DENSE MASS YELLING AND CHEERING AND THE DISCHARGE OF THE GUNS FAIRLY BLEW THEM BACK ACROSS THE WORK'S THEY HAD JUST TAKEN
2827-170438-0042 AGAIN THEY CHARGED AND AGAIN WERE DRIVEN BACK AND WHEN THE BATTLE ONCE MORE BEGAN THE UNION REINFORCEMENTS HAD ARRIVED IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT JACKSON HIMSELF WAS MORTALLY WOUNDED HE HAD BEEN LEADING AND URGING ON THE ADVANCE OF HIS MEN
2827-170438-0043 CHEERING THEM WITH VOICE AND GESTURE HIS PALE FACE FLUSHED WITH JOY AND EXCITEMENT WHILE FROM TIME TO TIME AS HE SAT ON HIS HORSE HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND LOOKING UPWARD THANKED HEAVEN FOR THE VICTORY IT HAD VOUCHSAFED HIM
2827-170438-0044 AS DARKNESS DREW NEAR HE WAS IN THE FRONT WHERE FRIEND AND FOE WERE MINGLED IN ALMOST INEXTRICABLE CONFUSION HE AND HIS STAFF WERE FIRED AT AT CLOSE RANGE BY THE UNION TROOPS AND AS THEY TURNED WERE FIRED AT AGAIN
2827-170438-0045 THROUGH A MISTAKE BY THE CONFEDERATES BEHIND THEM JACKSON FELL STRUCK IN SEVERAL PLACES HE WAS PUT IN A LITTER AND CARRIED BACK BUT HE NEVER LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AND WHEN ONE OF HIS GENERALS COMPLAINED OF THE TERRIBLE EFFECT OF THE UNION CANNONADE
2827-170438-0046 HE ANSWERED YOU MUST HOLD YOUR GROUND FOR SEVERAL DAYS HE LINGERED HEARING HOW LEE BEAT HOOKER IN DETAIL AND FORCED HIM BACK ACROSS THE RIVER THEN THE OLD PURITAN DIED AT THE END HIS MIND WANDERED
2827-170438-0047 AND HE THOUGHT HE WAS AGAIN COMMANDING IN BATTLE AND HIS LAST WORDS WERE LET US CROSS OVER THE RIVER AND REST IN THE SHADE
