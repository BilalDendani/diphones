3285-121400-0000 EVERY ONE THERE BEING WRAPPED IN PROFOUND SLEEP RAOUL HAD DESIRED TO BE AWAKENED SHOULD GRIMAUD ARRIVE BUT GRIMAUD DID NOT ARRIVE DOUBTLESS TOO THE HORSES ON THEIR PART
3285-121400-0001 APPRECIATED THE EIGHT HOURS OF REPOSE AND THE ABUNDANT STABLING WHICH WAS GRANTED THEM THE COUNT DE GUICHE WAS AWAKENED AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BY RAOUL WHO CAME TO WISH HIM GOOD DAY
3285-121400-0002 THEY BREAKFASTED IN HASTE AND AT SIX O'CLOCK HAD ALREADY GONE TEN MILES THE YOUNG COUNT'S CONVERSATION WAS MOST INTERESTING TO RAOUL THEREFORE HE LISTENED MUCH
3285-121400-0003 WHILST THE COUNT TALKED WELL AND LONG BROUGHT UP IN PARIS WHERE RAOUL HAD BEEN BUT ONCE AT THE COURT WHICH RAOUL HAD NEVER SEEN HIS FOLLIES AS PAGE
3285-121400-0004 TWO DUELS WHICH HE HAD ALREADY FOUND THE MEANS OF FIGHTING IN SPITE OF THE EDICTS AGAINST THEM AND MORE ESPECIALLY IN SPITE OF HIS TUTOR'S VIGILANCE THESE THINGS EXCITED THE GREATEST CURIOSITY IN RAOUL
3285-121400-0005 HE NAMED TO GUICHE THE PEOPLE WHOM HE HAD SEEN THERE GUICHE KNEW EVERYBODY MADAME DE NEUILLAN MADEMOISELLE D'AUBIGNE
3285-121400-0006 MADEMOISELLE PAULET MADAME DE CHEVREUSE HE CRITICISED EVERYBODY HUMOROUSLY RAOUL TREMBLED
3285-121400-0007 THEN CAME THE QUESTION OF GALLANTRY AND LOVE AFFAIRS UNDER THIS HEAD ALSO BRAGELONNE HAD MUCH MORE TO HEAR THAN TO TELL HE LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND FANCIED THAT HE DISCOVERED THROUGH
3285-121400-0008 THREE OR FOUR RATHER FRIVOLOUS ADVENTURES THAT THE COUNT LIKE HIMSELF HAD A SECRET TO HIDE IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS HEART DE GUICHE AS WE HAVE SAID BEFORE HAD BEEN EDUCATED AT THE COURT
3285-121400-0009 AND THE INTRIGUES OF THIS COURT WERE NOT UNKNOWN TO HIM IT WAS THE SAME COURT OF WHICH RAOUL HAD SO OFTEN HEARD THE COMTE DE LA FERE SPEAK
3285-121400-0010 THEREFORE EVERYTHING WHICH THE COUNT DE GUICHE RELATED WAS NEW TO HIS TRAVELING COMPANION THE YOUNG COUNT WITTY AND CAUSTIC PASSED ALL THE WORLD IN REVIEW THE QUEEN HERSELF WAS NOT SPARED
3285-121400-0011 THEY WERE APPROACHING THE SCENE OF WAR AND AS BANDS OF SPANIARDS SOMETIMES TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE NIGHT TO MAKE EXPEDITIONS EVEN AS FAR AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ARRAS THEY DETERMINED TO REMAIN IN THE TOWN UNTIL THE MORROW
3285-121400-0012 THE FRENCH ARMY HELD ALL BETWEEN PONT A MARC AS FAR AS VALENCIENNES
3285-121400-0013 THE PRINCE WAS SAID TO BE IN PERSON AT BETHUNE THE ENEMY'S ARMY EXTENDED FROM CASSEL TO COURTRAY AND AS THERE WAS NO SPECIES OF VIOLENCE OR PILLAGE IT DID NOT COMMIT
3285-121400-0014 THE POOR PEOPLE ON THE FRONTIER QUITTED THEIR ISOLATED DWELLINGS AND FLED FOR REFUGE INTO THE STRONG CITIES WHICH HELD OUT A SHELTER TO THEM ARRAS WAS ENCUMBERED WITH FUGITIVES AN APPROACHING BATTLE WAS MUCH SPOKEN OF
3285-121400-0015 ONLY IN ORDER TO AWAIT A REINFORCEMENT THAT HAD JUST REACHED HIM THE YOUNG MEN CONGRATULATED THEMSELVES ON HAVING ARRIVED SO OPPORTUNELY THE EVENING WAS EMPLOYED IN DISCUSSING THE WAR
3285-121400-0016 THE GROOMS POLISHED THEIR ARMS THE YOUNG MEN LOADED THE PISTOLS IN CASE OF A SKIRMISH AND THEY AWOKE IN DESPAIR HAVING BOTH DREAMED THAT THEY HAD ARRIVED TOO LATE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BATTLE IN THE MORNING IT WAS RUMORED
3285-121400-0017 AND FALLEN BACK ON CARVIN LEAVING HOWEVER A STRONG GARRISON IN THE FORMER CITY BUT AS THERE WAS NOTHING POSITIVELY CERTAIN IN THIS REPORT THE YOUNG WARRIORS DECIDED TO CONTINUE THEIR WAY TOWARD BETHUNE
3285-121400-0018 THE COUNT'S TUTOR WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE COUNTRY HE CONSEQUENTLY PROPOSED TO TAKE A CROSSROAD
3285-121400-0019 AND A STATEMENT OF THEIR ROUTE WAS LEFT FOR GRIMAUD ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THEY SET OUT DE GUICHE WHO WAS YOUNG AND IMPULSIVE SAID TO RAOUL HERE WE ARE THREE MASTERS AND THREE SERVANTS
3285-121400-0020 OUR VALETS ARE WELL ARMED AND YOURS SEEMS TO BE TOUGH ENOUGH
3285-121400-0021 YES YES RESUMED DE GUICHE I AM SURE HE CAN FIRE A MUSKET WHEN REQUIRED ON MY SIDE I HAVE TWO SURE MEN WHO HAVE BEEN IN ACTION WITH MY FATHER WE THEREFORE REPRESENT SIX FIGHTING MEN
3285-121400-0022 HOLLOA YOUNG PEOPLE STOP THERE SAID THE TUTOR JOINING IN THE CONVERSATION

3285-121400-0025 THERE THEY INQUIRED AND LEARNED THAT THE PRINCE HAD IN REALITY QUITTED BETHUNE AND STATIONED HIMSELF BETWEEN CAMBRIA AND LA VENTHIE THEREFORE LEAVING DIRECTIONS AT EVERY PLACE FOR GRIMAUD
3285-121400-0026 THEY TOOK A CROSSROAD WHICH CONDUCTED THE LITTLE TROOP BY THE BANK OF A SMALL STREAM
3285-121400-0027 INTERSECTED BY VALLEYS AS GREEN AS THE EMERALD HERE AND THERE THEY PASSED LITTLE COPSES CROSSING THE PATH WHICH THEY WERE FOLLOWING
3285-121400-0028 IN EACH OF THESE LITTLE WOODS THE TUTOR PLACED HIS TWO SERVANTS AT THE HEAD OF THE BAND THUS FORMING THE ADVANCE GUARD HIMSELF AND THE TWO YOUNG MEN REPRESENTED THE BODY OF THE ARMY WHILST OLIVAIN WITH HIS RIFLE UPON HIS KNEE
3285-121400-0029 AND HIS EYES UPON THE WATCH PROTECTED THE REAR
3285-121400-0030 A RATHER THICK WOOD AND WHEN THEY HAD ARRIVED AT A DISTANCE OF A HUNDRED STEPS FROM IT MONSIEUR D'ARMINGES TOOK HIS USUAL PRECAUTIONS AND SENT ON IN ADVANCE THE COUNT'S TWO GROOMS
3285-121400-0031 THE SERVANTS HAD JUST DISAPPEARED UNDER THE TREES FOLLOWED BY THE TUTOR AND THE YOUNG MEN WERE LAUGHING AND TALKING ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS OFF OLIVAIN WAS AT THE SAME DISTANCE IN THE REAR WHEN SUDDENLY THERE RESOUNDED FIVE OR SIX MUSKET SHOTS
3285-121400-0032 THE TUTOR FOLLOWED THEM WERE YOU STOPPED EAGERLY INQUIRED THE TWO YOUTHS NO REPLIED THE SERVANTS IT IS EVEN PROBABLE THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN SEEN THE SHOTS WERE FIRED ABOUT A HUNDRED PACES IN ADVANCE OF US IN THE THICKEST PART OF THE WOOD
3285-121400-0033 AND WE RETURNED TO ASK YOUR ADVICE MY ADVICE IS THIS SAID MONSIEUR D'ARMINGES AND IF NEEDS BE MY WILL THAT WE BEAT A RETREAT
3285-121400-0034 DID YOU SEE NOTHING THERE ASKED THE COUNT I THOUGHT I SAW SAID ONE OF THE SERVANTS HORSEMEN DRESSED IN YELLOW CREEPING ALONG THE BED OF THE STREAM THAT'S IT SAID THE TUTOR
3285-121400-0035 WE HAVE FALLEN IN WITH A PARTY OF SPANIARDS COME BACK SIRS BACK THE TWO YOUTHS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND AT THIS MOMENT A PISTOL SHOT AND CRIES FOR HELP WERE HEARD ANOTHER GLANCE BETWEEN THE YOUNG MEN
3285-121400-0036 CONVINCED THEM BOTH THAT NEITHER HAD ANY WISH TO GO BACK AND AS THE TUTOR HAD ALREADY TURNED HIS HORSE'S HEAD THEY BOTH SPURRED FORWARD RAOUL CRYING FOLLOW ME OLIVAIN AND THE COUNT DE GUICHE
3285-121400-0037 AND BEFORE THE TUTOR COULD RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE THEY HAD BOTH DISAPPEARED INTO THE FOREST WHILST THEY SPURRED THEIR STEEDS THEY HELD THEIR PISTOLS READY ALSO
3285-121400-0038 IN FIVE MINUTES THEY ARRIVED AT THE SPOT WHENCE THE NOISE HAD PROCEEDED AND THEN RESTRAINING THEIR HORSES THEY ADVANCED CAUTIOUSLY HUSH WHISPERED DE GUICHE THESE ARE CAVALIERS YES THREE ON HORSEBACK
3285-121400-0039 AND THREE WHO HAVE DISMOUNTED CAN YOU SEE WHAT THEY ARE DOING YES THEY APPEAR TO BE SEARCHING A WOUNDED OR DEAD MAN IT IS SOME COWARDLY ASSASSINATION SAID DE GUICHE THEY ARE SOLDIERS THOUGH RESUMED DE BRAGELONNE
3285-121400-0040 YES SKIRMISHERS THAT IS TO SAY HIGHWAY ROBBERS AT THEM CRIED RAOUL AT THEM ECHOED DE GUICHE OH GENTLEMEN GENTLEMEN IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN CRIED THE POOR TUTOR
3285-121400-0041 BUT HE WAS NOT LISTENED TO AND HIS CRIES ONLY SERVED TO AROUSE THE ATTENTION OF THE SPANIARDS THE MEN ON HORSEBACK AT ONCE RUSHED AT THE TWO YOUTHS LEAVING THE THREE OTHERS TO COMPLETE THE PLUNDER OF THE DEAD OR WOUNDED TRAVELERS
3285-121400-0042 FOR ON APPROACHING NEARER INSTEAD OF ONE EXTENDED FIGURE THE YOUNG MEN DISCOVERED TWO DE GUICHE FIRED THE FIRST SHOT AT TEN PACES AND MISSED HIS MAN AND THE SPANIARD WHO HAD ADVANCED TO MEET RAOUL AIMED IN HIS TURN
3285-121400-0043 AND RAOUL FELT A PAIN IN THE LEFT ARM SIMILAR TO THAT OF A BLOW FROM A WHIP HE LET OFF HIS FIRE AT BUT FOUR PACES STRUCK IN THE BREAST AND EXTENDING HIS ARMS THE SPANIARD FELL BACK ON THE CRUPPER
3285-121400-0044 AND THE TERRIFIED HORSE TURNING AROUND CARRIED HIM OFF RAOUL AT THIS MOMENT PERCEIVED THE MUZZLE OF A GUN POINTED AT HIM AND REMEMBERING THE RECOMMENDATION OF ATHOS HE WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING
3285-121400-0045 MADE HIS HORSE REAR AS THE SHOT WAS FIRED HIS HORSE BOUNDED TO ONE SIDE LOSING ITS FOOTING AND FELL ENTANGLING RAOUL'S LEG UNDER ITS BODY THE SPANIARD SPRANG FORWARD AND SEIZED THE GUN BY ITS MUZZLE
3285-121400-0046 IN ORDER TO STRIKE RAOUL ON THE HEAD WITH THE BUTT IN THE POSITION IN WHICH RAOUL LAY UNFORTUNATELY HE COULD NEITHER DRAW HIS SWORD FROM THE SCABBARD NOR HIS PISTOLS FROM THEIR HOLSTERS THE BUTT END OF THE MUSKET HOVERED OVER HIS HEAD
3285-121400-0047 AND HE COULD SCARCELY RESTRAIN HIMSELF FROM CLOSING HIS EYES WHEN WITH ONE BOUND GUICHE REACHED THE SPANIARD AND PLACED A PISTOL AT HIS THROAT YIELD HE CRIED OR YOU ARE A DEAD MAN
3285-121400-0048 THE MUSKET FELL FROM THE SOLDIER'S HANDS WHO YIELDED ON THE INSTANT GUICHE SUMMONED ONE OF HIS GROOMS AND DELIVERING THE PRISONER INTO HIS CHARGE WITH ORDERS TO SHOOT HIM THROUGH THE HEAD IF HE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE HE LEAPED FROM HIS HORSE AND APPROACHED RAOUL
3285-121400-0049 FAITH SIR SAID RAOUL SMILING ALTHOUGH HIS PALLOR BETRAYED THE EXCITEMENT CONSEQUENT ON A FIRST AFFAIR YOU ARE IN A GREAT HURRY TO PAY YOUR DEBTS AND HAVE NOT BEEN LONG UNDER ANY OBLIGATION TO ME WITHOUT YOUR AID CONTINUED HE
