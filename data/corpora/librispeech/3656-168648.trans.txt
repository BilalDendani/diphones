3656-168648-0000 THIS ENTRANCE WHICH USUALLY STOOD AJAR IN THE MOST INVITING FASHION PERMITTED A VIEW OF TWO THINGS NEITHER OF WHICH HAVE ANYTHING VERY FUNEREAL ABOUT THEM A COURTYARD SURROUNDED BY WALLS HUNG WITH VINES AND THE FACE OF A LOUNGING PORTER
3656-168648-0001 ABOVE THE WALL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE COURT TALL TREES WERE VISIBLE WHEN A RAY OF SUNLIGHT ENLIVENED THE COURTYARD WHEN A GLASS OF WINE CHEERED UP THE PORTER
3656-168648-0002 WITHOUT CARRYING AWAY A SMILING IMPRESSION OF IT NEVERTHELESS IT WAS A SOMBRE PLACE OF WHICH ONE HAD HAD A GLIMPSE THE THRESHOLD SMILED THE HOUSE PRAYED AND WEPT IF ONE SUCCEEDED IN PASSING THE PORTER WHICH WAS NOT EASY
3656-168648-0003 WHICH WAS EVEN NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR EVERY ONE FOR THERE WAS AN OPEN SESAME WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO KNOW IF THE PORTER ONCE PASSED ONE ENTERED A LITTLE VESTIBULE ON THE RIGHT
3656-168648-0004 ON WHICH OPENED A STAIRCASE SHUT IN BETWEEN TWO WALLS AND SO NARROW THAT ONLY ONE PERSON COULD ASCEND IT AT A TIME IF ONE DID NOT ALLOW ONE'S SELF TO BE ALARMED BY A DAUBING OF CANARY YELLOW WITH A DADO OF CHOCOLATE WHICH CLOTHED THIS STAIRCASE
3656-168648-0005 IF ONE VENTURED TO ASCEND IT ONE CROSSED A FIRST LANDING THEN A SECOND AND ARRIVED ON THE FIRST STORY AT A CORRIDOR WHERE THE YELLOW WASH AND THE CHOCOLATE HUED PLINTH PURSUED ONE WITH A PEACEABLE PERSISTENCY
3656-168648-0006 STAIRCASE AND CORRIDOR WERE LIGHTED BY TWO BEAUTIFUL WINDOWS THE CORRIDOR TOOK A TURN AND BECAME DARK IF ONE DOUBLED THIS CAPE ONE ARRIVED A FEW PACES FURTHER ON IN FRONT OF A DOOR WHICH WAS ALL THE MORE MYSTERIOUS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT FASTENED
3656-168648-0007 IF ONE OPENED IT ONE FOUND ONE'S SELF IN A LITTLE CHAMBER ABOUT SIX FEET SQUARE TILED WELL SCRUBBED CLEAN COLD AND HUNG WITH NANKIN PAPER WITH GREEN FLOWERS AT FIFTEEN SOUS THE ROLL
3656-168648-0008 A WHITE DULL LIGHT FELL FROM A LARGE WINDOW WITH TINY PANES ON THE LEFT WHICH USURPED THE WHOLE WIDTH OF THE ROOM ONE GAZED ABOUT BUT SAW NO ONE ONE LISTENED ONE HEARD NEITHER A FOOTSTEP NOR A HUMAN MURMUR
3656-168648-0009 THE WALLS WERE BARE THE CHAMBER WAS NOT FURNISHED THERE WAS NOT EVEN A CHAIR ONE LOOKED AGAIN AND BEHELD ON THE WALL FACING THE DOOR A QUADRANGULAR HOLE ABOUT A FOOT SQUARE WITH A GRATING OF INTERLACING IRON BARS
3656-168648-0010 BLACK KNOTTED SOLID WHICH FORMED SQUARES I HAD ALMOST SAID MESHES OF LESS THAN AN INCH AND A HALF IN DIAGONAL LENGTH THE LITTLE GREEN FLOWERS OF THE NANKIN PAPER RAN
3656-168648-0011 IN A CALM AND ORDERLY MANNER TO THOSE IRON BARS WITHOUT BEING STARTLED OR THROWN INTO CONFUSION BY THEIR FUNEREAL CONTACT
3656-168648-0012 OR AN EXIT THROUGH THE SQUARE HOLE THIS GRATING WOULD HAVE PREVENTED IT IT DID NOT ALLOW THE PASSAGE OF THE BODY BUT IT DID ALLOW THE PASSAGE OF THE EYES
3656-168648-0013 OF THE MIND THIS SEEMS TO HAVE OCCURRED TO THEM FOR IT HAD BEEN RE ENFORCED BY A SHEET OF TIN INSERTED IN THE WALL A LITTLE IN THE REAR AND PIERCED WITH A THOUSAND HOLES MORE MICROSCOPIC THAN THE HOLES OF A STRAINER AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PLATE
3656-168648-0014 AN APERTURE HAD BEEN PIERCED EXACTLY SIMILAR TO THE ORIFICE OF A LETTER BOX A BIT OF TAPE ATTACHED TO A BELL WIRE HUNG AT THE RIGHT OF THE GRATED OPENING IF THE TAPE WAS PULLED A BELL RANG AND ONE HEARD A VOICE VERY NEAR AT HAND WHICH MADE ONE START
3656-168648-0015 WHO IS THERE THE VOICE DEMANDED IT WAS A WOMAN'S VOICE A GENTLE VOICE SO GENTLE THAT IT WAS MOURNFUL HERE AGAIN THERE WAS A MAGICAL WORD WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO KNOW
3656-168648-0016 IF ONE DID NOT KNOW IT THE VOICE CEASED THE WALL BECAME SILENT ONCE MORE AS THOUGH THE TERRIFIED OBSCURITY OF THE SEPULCHRE HAD BEEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF ONE KNEW THE PASSWORD THE VOICE RESUMED ENTER ON THE RIGHT
3656-168648-0017 ONE THEN PERCEIVED ON THE RIGHT FACING THE WINDOW A GLASS DOOR SURMOUNTED BY A FRAME GLAZED AND PAINTED GRAY ON RAISING THE LATCH AND CROSSING THE THRESHOLD
3656-168648-0018 BEFORE THE GRATING IS LOWERED AND THE CHANDELIER IS LIGHTED ONE WAS IN FACT IN A SORT OF THEATRE BOX NARROW FURNISHED WITH TWO OLD CHAIRS AND A MUCH FRAYED STRAW MATTING SPARELY ILLUMINATED BY THE VAGUE LIGHT FROM THE GLASS DOOR
3656-168648-0019 A REGULAR BOX WITH ITS FRONT JUST OF A HEIGHT TO LEAN UPON BEARING A TABLET OF BLACK WOOD THIS BOX WAS GRATED ONLY THE GRATING OF IT WAS NOT OF GILDED WOOD AS AT THE OPERA
3656-168648-0020 THE FIRST MINUTES PASSED WHEN ONE'S EYES BEGAN TO GROW USED TO THIS CELLAR LIKE HALF TWILIGHT ONE TRIED TO PASS THE GRATING BUT GOT NO FURTHER THAN SIX INCHES BEYOND IT THERE HE ENCOUNTERED A BARRIER OF BLACK SHUTTERS
3656-168648-0021 RE ENFORCED AND FORTIFIED WITH TRANSVERSE BEAMS OF WOOD PAINTED A GINGERBREAD YELLOW THESE SHUTTERS WERE DIVIDED INTO LONG NARROW SLATS AND THEY MASKED THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE GRATING THEY WERE ALWAYS CLOSED
3656-168648-0022 AT THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MOMENTS ONE HEARD A VOICE PROCEEDING FROM BEHIND THESE SHUTTERS AND SAYING I AM HERE WHAT DO YOU WISH WITH ME IT WAS A BELOVED SOMETIMES AN ADORED VOICE NO ONE WAS VISIBLE
3656-168648-0023 HARDLY THE SOUND OF A BREATH WAS AUDIBLE IT SEEMED AS THOUGH IT WERE A SPIRIT WHICH HAD BEEN EVOKED
3656-168648-0024 IF ONE CHANCED TO BE WITHIN CERTAIN PRESCRIBED AND VERY RARE CONDITIONS THE SLAT OF ONE OF THE SHUTTERS OPENED OPPOSITE YOU THE EVOKED SPIRIT BECAME AN APPARITION BEHIND THE GRATING BEHIND THE SHUTTER
3656-168648-0025 ONE PERCEIVED SO FAR AS THE GRATING PERMITTED SIGHT A HEAD OF WHICH ONLY THE MOUTH AND THE CHIN WERE VISIBLE THE REST WAS COVERED WITH A BLACK VEIL ONE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A BLACK GUIMPE AND A FORM THAT WAS BARELY DEFINED COVERED WITH A BLACK SHROUD
3656-168648-0026 THAT HEAD SPOKE WITH YOU BUT DID NOT LOOK AT YOU AND NEVER SMILED AT YOU THE LIGHT WHICH CAME FROM BEHIND YOU WAS ADJUSTED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT YOU SAW HER IN THE WHITE AND SHE SAW YOU IN THE BLACK
3656-168648-0027 THIS LIGHT WAS SYMBOLICAL NEVERTHELESS YOUR EYES PLUNGED EAGERLY THROUGH THAT OPENING WHICH WAS MADE IN THAT PLACE SHUT OFF FROM ALL GLANCES A PROFOUND VAGUENESS ENVELOPED THAT FORM CLAD IN MOURNING
3656-168648-0028 YOUR EYES SEARCHED THAT VAGUENESS AND SOUGHT TO MAKE OUT THE SURROUNDINGS OF THE APPARITION AT THE EXPIRATION OF A VERY SHORT TIME YOU DISCOVERED THAT YOU COULD SEE NOTHING WHAT YOU BEHELD WAS NIGHT
3656-168648-0029 EMPTINESS SHADOWS A WINTRY MIST MINGLED WITH A VAPOR FROM THE TOMB A SORT OF TERRIBLE PEACE A SILENCE FROM WHICH YOU COULD GATHER NOTHING NOT EVEN SIGHS A GLOOM IN WHICH YOU COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING
3656-168648-0030 NOT EVEN PHANTOMS WHAT YOU BEHELD WAS THE INTERIOR OF A CLOISTER IT WAS THE INTERIOR OF THAT SEVERE AND GLOOMY EDIFICE WHICH WAS CALLED THE CONVENT OF THE BERNARDINES OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATION
3656-168648-0031 THE BOX IN WHICH YOU STOOD WAS THE PARLOR THE FIRST VOICE WHICH HAD ADDRESSED YOU WAS THAT OF THE PORTRESS WHO ALWAYS SAT MOTIONLESS AND SILENT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL NEAR THE SQUARE OPENING SCREENED BY THE IRON GRATING
3656-168648-0032 AND THE PLATE WITH ITS THOUSAND HOLES AS BY A DOUBLE VISOR THE OBSCURITY WHICH BATHED THE GRATED BOX AROSE FROM THE FACT THAT THE PARLOR WHICH HAD A WINDOW ON THE SIDE OF THE WORLD HAD NONE ON THE SIDE OF THE CONVENT
3656-168648-0033 PROFANE EYES MUST SEE NOTHING OF THAT SACRED PLACE NEVERTHELESS THERE WAS SOMETHING BEYOND THAT SHADOW THERE WAS A LIGHT THERE WAS LIFE IN THE MIDST OF THAT DEATH
3656-168648-0034 ALTHOUGH THIS WAS THE MOST STRICTLY WALLED OF ALL CONVENTS WE SHALL ENDEAVOR TO MAKE OUR WAY INTO IT AND TO TAKE THE READER IN AND TO SAY
3656-168648-0035 THINGS WHICH STORY TELLERS HAVE NEVER SEEN
