1914-133440-0000 IT MAY SEEM ODD TO YOU BUT IT WAS TWO DAYS BEFORE I COULD FOLLOW UP THE NEW FOUND CLUE IN WHAT WAS MANIFESTLY THE PROPER WAY I FELT A PECULIAR SHRINKING FROM THOSE PALLID BODIES
1914-133440-0001 THEY WERE JUST THE HALF BLEACHED COLOUR OF THE WORMS AND THINGS ONE SEES PRESERVED IN SPIRIT IN A ZOOLOGICAL MUSEUM AND THEY WERE FILTHILY COLD TO THE TOUCH PROBABLY MY SHRINKING WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE SYMPATHETIC INFLUENCE OF THE ELOI
1914-133440-0002 WHOSE DISGUST OF THE MORLOCKS I NOW BEGAN TO APPRECIATE THE NEXT NIGHT I DID NOT SLEEP WELL PROBABLY MY HEALTH WAS A LITTLE DISORDERED I WAS OPPRESSED WITH PERPLEXITY AND DOUBT ONCE OR TWICE I HAD A FEELING OF
1914-133440-0003 INTENSE FEAR FOR WHICH I COULD PERCEIVE NO DEFINITE REASON I REMEMBER CREEPING NOISELESSLY INTO THE GREAT HALL WHERE THE LITTLE PEOPLE WERE SLEEPING IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT NIGHT WEENA WAS AMONG THEM AND FEELING REASSURED BY THEIR PRESENCE
1914-133440-0004 IT OCCURRED TO ME EVEN THEN THAT IN THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS THE MOON MUST PASS THROUGH ITS LAST QUARTER AND THE NIGHTS GROW DARK
1914-133440-0005 I HAD THE RESTLESS FEELING OF ONE WHO SHIRKS AN INEVITABLE DUTY I FELT ASSURED THAT THE TIME MACHINE WAS ONLY TO BE RECOVERED BY BOLDLY PENETRATING THESE UNDERGROUND MYSTERIES YET I COULD NOT FACE THE MYSTERY IF
1914-133440-0006 WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT BUT I WAS SO HORRIBLY ALONE AND EVEN TO CLAMBER DOWN INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE WELL APPALLED ME I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WILL UNDERSTAND MY FEELING BUT I NEVER FELT QUITE SAFE
1914-133440-0007 AT MY BACK IT WAS THIS RESTLESSNESS THIS INSECURITY PERHAPS THAT DROVE ME FURTHER AND FURTHER AFIELD IN MY EXPLORING EXPEDITIONS GOING TO THE SOUTH WESTWARD TOWARDS THE RISING COUNTRY THAT IS NOW CALLED COMBE WOOD
1914-133440-0008 I OBSERVED FAR OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF NINETEENTH CENTURY BANSTEAD A VAST GREEN STRUCTURE DIFFERENT IN CHARACTER FROM ANY I HAD HITHERTO SEEN IT WAS LARGER THAN THE LARGEST OF THE PALACES OR RUINS I KNEW
1914-133440-0009 THIS DIFFERENCE IN ASPECT SUGGESTED A DIFFERENCE IN USE AND I WAS MINDED TO PUSH ON AND EXPLORE BUT THE DAY WAS GROWING LATE AND I HAD COME UPON THE SIGHT OF THE PLACE AFTER A LONG AND TIRING CIRCUIT
1914-133440-0010 SO I RESOLVED TO HOLD OVER THE ADVENTURE FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY AND I RETURNED TO THE WELCOME AND THE CARESSES OF LITTLE WEENA BUT NEXT MORNING I PERCEIVED CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT MY CURIOSITY REGARDING THE PALACE OF GREEN PORCELAIN WAS A PIECE OF SELF DECEPTION
1914-133440-0011 TO ENABLE ME TO SHIRK BY ANOTHER DAY AN EXPERIENCE I DREADED I RESOLVED I WOULD MAKE THE DESCENT WITHOUT FURTHER WASTE OF TIME AND STARTED OUT IN THE EARLY MORNING TOWARDS A WELL NEAR THE RUINS OF GRANITE AND ALUMINIUM
1914-133440-0012 LITTLE WEENA RAN WITH ME SHE DANCED BESIDE ME TO THE WELL BUT WHEN SHE SAW ME LEAN OVER THE MOUTH AND LOOK DOWNWARD SHE SEEMED STRANGELY DISCONCERTED
1914-133440-0013 GOOD BYE LITTLE WEENA I SAID KISSING HER AND THEN PUTTING HER DOWN I BEGAN TO FEEL OVER THE PARAPET FOR THE CLIMBING HOOKS RATHER HASTILY I MAY AS WELL CONFESS FOR I FEARED MY COURAGE MIGHT LEAK AWAY AT FIRST SHE WATCHED ME IN AMAZEMENT
1914-133440-0014 I SAW HER AGONIZED FACE OVER THE PARAPET AND SMILED TO REASSURE HER THEN I HAD TO LOOK DOWN AT THE UNSTABLE HOOKS TO WHICH I CLUNG
1914-133440-0015 I HAD TO CLAMBER DOWN A SHAFT OF PERHAPS TWO HUNDRED YARDS THE DESCENT WAS EFFECTED BY MEANS OF METALLIC BARS PROJECTING FROM THE SIDES OF THE WELL AND THESE BEING ADAPTED TO THE NEEDS OF A CREATURE MUCH SMALLER AND LIGHTER THAN MYSELF
1914-133440-0016 I WAS SPEEDILY CRAMPED AND FATIGUED BY THE DESCENT AND NOT SIMPLY FATIGUED ONE OF THE BARS BENT SUDDENLY UNDER MY WEIGHT AND ALMOST SWUNG ME OFF INTO THE BLACKNESS BENEATH
1914-133440-0017 DISK IN WHICH A STAR WAS VISIBLE WHILE LITTLE WEENA'S HEAD SHOWED AS A ROUND BLACK PROJECTION THE THUDDING SOUND OF A MACHINE BELOW GREW LOUDER AND MORE OPPRESSIVE
1914-133440-0018 EVERYTHING SAVE THAT LITTLE DISK ABOVE WAS PROFOUNDLY DARK AND WHEN I LOOKED UP AGAIN WEENA HAD DISAPPEARED I WAS IN AN AGONY OF DISCOMFORT I HAD SOME THOUGHT OF TRYING TO GO UP THE SHAFT AGAIN AND LEAVE THE UNDER WORLD ALONE
1914-133440-0019 SWINGING MYSELF IN I FOUND IT WAS THE APERTURE OF A NARROW HORIZONTAL TUNNEL IN WHICH I COULD LIE DOWN AND REST IT WAS NOT TOO SOON MY ARMS ACHED MY BACK WAS CRAMPED AND I WAS TREMBLING WITH THE PROLONGED TERROR OF A FALL
1914-133440-0020 BESIDES THIS THE UNBROKEN DARKNESS HAD HAD A DISTRESSING EFFECT UPON MY EYES THE AIR WAS FULL OF THE THROB AND HUM OF MACHINERY PUMPING AIR DOWN THE SHAFT I DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG I LAY I WAS ROUSED BY A SOFT HAND TOUCHING MY FACE
1914-133440-0021 LIVING AS THEY DID IN WHAT APPEARED TO ME IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS THEIR EYES WERE ABNORMALLY LARGE AND SENSITIVE JUST AS ARE THE PUPILS OF THE ABYSMAL FISHES
1914-133440-0022 VANISHING INTO DARK GUTTERS AND TUNNELS FROM WHICH THEIR EYES GLARED AT ME IN THE STRANGEST FASHION I TRIED TO CALL TO THEM BUT THE LANGUAGE THEY HAD WAS APPARENTLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE OVER WORLD PEOPLE
1914-133440-0023 SO THAT I WAS NEEDS LEFT TO MY OWN UNAIDED EFFORTS AND THE THOUGHT OF FLIGHT BEFORE EXPLORATION WAS EVEN THEN IN MY MIND BUT I SAID TO MYSELF YOU ARE IN FOR IT NOW
1914-133440-0024 AND FEELING MY WAY ALONG THE TUNNEL I FOUND THE NOISE OF MACHINERY GROW LOUDER PRESENTLY THE WALLS FELL AWAY FROM ME AND I CAME TO A LARGE OPEN SPACE AND STRIKING ANOTHER MATCH SAW THAT I HAD ENTERED A VAST ARCHED CAVERN WHICH STRETCHED INTO UTTER DARKNESS BEYOND THE RANGE OF MY LIGHT THE VIEW I HAD OF IT WAS AS MUCH AS ONE COULD SEE IN THE BURNING OF A MATCH
1914-133440-0025 THE PLACE BY THE BY WAS VERY STUFFY AND OPPRESSIVE AND THE FAINT HALITUS OF FRESHLY SHED BLOOD WAS IN THE AIR SOME WAY DOWN THE CENTRAL VISTA WAS A LITTLE TABLE OF WHITE METAL LAID WITH WHAT SEEMED A MEAL
1914-133440-0026 THE HEAVY SMELL THE BIG UNMEANING SHAPES THE OBSCENE FIGURES LURKING IN THE SHADOWS AND ONLY WAITING FOR THE DARKNESS TO COME AT ME AGAIN THEN THE MATCH BURNED DOWN AND STUNG MY FINGERS AND FELL A WRIGGLING RED SPOT IN THE BLACKNESS
1914-133440-0027 I HAVE THOUGHT SINCE HOW PARTICULARLY ILL EQUIPPED I WAS FOR SUCH AN EXPERIENCE WHEN I HAD STARTED WITH THE TIME MACHINE I HAD STARTED WITH THE ABSURD ASSUMPTION THAT THE MEN OF THE FUTURE WOULD CERTAINLY BE INFINITELY AHEAD OF OURSELVES IN ALL THEIR APPLIANCES
1914-133440-0028 AND FOUR SAFETY MATCHES THAT STILL REMAINED TO ME I WAS AFRAID TO PUSH MY WAY IN AMONG ALL THIS MACHINERY IN THE DARK AND IT WAS ONLY WITH MY LAST GLIMPSE OF LIGHT I DISCOVERED THAT MY STORE OF MATCHES HAD RUN LOW
1914-133440-0029 A HAND TOUCHED MINE LANK FINGERS CAME FEELING OVER MY FACE AND I WAS SENSIBLE OF A PECULIAR UNPLEASANT ODOUR I FANCIED I HEARD THE BREATHING OF A CROWD OF THOSE DREADFUL LITTLE BEINGS ABOUT ME
1914-133440-0030 THE SUDDEN REALIZATION OF MY IGNORANCE OF THEIR WAYS OF THINKING AND DOING CAME HOME TO ME VERY VIVIDLY IN THE DARKNESS I SHOUTED AT THEM AS LOUDLY AS I COULD THEY STARTED AWAY
1914-133440-0031 THEY CLUTCHED AT ME MORE BOLDLY WHISPERING ODD SOUNDS TO EACH OTHER I SHIVERED VIOLENTLY AND SHOUTED AGAIN RATHER DISCORDANTLY THIS TIME THEY WERE NOT SO SERIOUSLY ALARMED AND THEY MADE A QUEER LAUGHING NOISE AS THEY CAME BACK AT ME I WILL CONFESS I WAS HORRIBLY FRIGHTENED I DETERMINED TO STRIKE ANOTHER MATCH AND ESCAPE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF ITS GLARE I DID SO
1914-133440-0032 AND EKING OUT THE FLICKER WITH A SCRAP OF PAPER FROM MY POCKET I MADE GOOD MY RETREAT TO THE NARROW TUNNEL BUT I HAD SCARCE ENTERED THIS WHEN MY LIGHT WAS BLOWN OUT AND IN THE BLACKNESS I COULD HEAR THE MORLOCKS RUSTLING LIKE WIND AMONG LEAVES AND PATTERING LIKE THE RAIN AS THEY HURRIED AFTER ME
1914-133440-0033 IN A MOMENT I WAS CLUTCHED BY SEVERAL HANDS
1914-133440-0034 BUT I DID NOT STAY TO LOOK I PROMISE YOU I RETREATED AGAIN AND WHEN MY SECOND MATCH HAD ENDED I STRUCK MY THIRD IT HAD ALMOST BURNED THROUGH WHEN I REACHED THE OPENING INTO THE SHAFT I LAY DOWN ON THE EDGE FOR THE THROB OF THE GREAT PUMP BELOW MADE ME GIDDY
1914-133440-0035 ALL BUT ONE LITTLE WRETCH WHO FOLLOWED ME FOR SOME WAY AND WELL NIGH SECURED MY BOOT AS A TROPHY THAT CLIMB SEEMED INTERMINABLE TO ME WITH THE LAST TWENTY OR THIRTY FEET OF IT A DEADLY NAUSEA CAME UPON ME
1914-133440-0036 AT LAST HOWEVER I GOT OVER THE WELL MOUTH SOMEHOW AND STAGGERED OUT OF THE RUIN INTO THE BLINDING SUNLIGHT I FELL UPON MY FACE EVEN THE SOIL SMELT SWEET AND CLEAN THEN
1914-133440-0037 I REMEMBER WEENA KISSING MY HANDS AND EARS AND THE VOICES OF OTHERS AMONG THE ELOI THEN FOR A TIME
