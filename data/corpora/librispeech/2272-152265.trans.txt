2272-152265-0002 THE GERMAN NOBLES WERE NOT WILLING FOR ANY FOREIGN PRINCE TO GOVERN THEM AND YET THEY SAW THAT THEY MUST UNITE TO DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY AGAINST THE INVASIONS OF THE BARBARIANS
2272-152265-0003 HOWEVER ALTHOUGH HE BECAME KING IN NAME CONRAD NEVER HAD MUCH POWER OVER HIS NOBLES SOME OF THEM REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE HIM AS KING AND HIS REIGN WAS DISTURBED BY QUARRELS AND WARS
2272-152265-0004 AND ON HIS DEATH BED HE SAID TO HIS BROTHER HENRY DUKE OF SAXONY IS THE ABLEST RULER IN THE EMPIRE ELECT HIM KING AND GERMANY WILL HAVE PEACE A FEW MONTHS AFTER CONRAD'S DEATH
2272-152265-0005 AND ELECTED HENRY TO BE THEIR KING AT THIS TIME IT WAS THE CUSTOM IN EUROPE TO HUNT VARIOUS BIRDS SUCH AS THE WILD DUCK AND PARTRIDGE WITH FALCONS THE FALCONS WERE LONG WINGED BIRDS OF PREY RESEMBLING HAWKS THEY WERE TRAINED TO PERCH ON THEIR MASTER'S WRIST
2272-152265-0006 AND WAIT PATIENTLY UNTIL THEY WERE TOLD TO FLY THEN THEY WOULD SWIFTLY DART AT THEIR PREY AND BEAR IT TO THE GROUND HENRY WAS VERY FOND OF FALCONRY AND HENCE WAS KNOWN AS HENRY THE FOWLER OR FALCONER AS SOON AS THE OTHER DUKES HAD ELECTED HIM KING
2272-152265-0007 A MESSENGER WAS SENT TO SAXONY TO INFORM HIM OF THE HONOR DONE HIM AFTER A SEARCH OF SOME DAYS HE WAS AT LAST FOUND FAR UP IN THE HARTZ MOUNTAINS HUNTING WITH HIS FALCONS KNEELING AT HIS FEET THE MESSENGER SAID GOD SAVE YOU HENRY OF SAXONY

2272-152265-0009 SO HENRY THE FOWLER LEFT THE CHASE TO TAKE UP HIS DUTIES AS KING OF THE GERMANS TWO IN PROPER TIME HENRY WAS PROCLAIMED KING OF GERMANY BUT HE WAS HARDLY SEATED ON THE THRONE WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS INVADED BY THOUSANDS OF MAGYARS
2272-152265-0010 BECAUSE IT STOPPED THE WAR FOR A LONG TERM OF YEARS WHEN THE MAGYAR KING LEARNED THAT HIS SON WAS A PRISONER IN THE HANDS OF KING HENRY HE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH GRIEF HE MOURNED FOR HIS SON DAY AND NIGHT AND AT LAST SENT TO THE GERMAN CAMP A MAGYAR CHIEF WITH A FLAG OF TRUCE TO BEG THAT THE PRINCE MIGHT BE GIVEN UP
2272-152265-0011 OUR KING SAYS THAT HE WILL GIVE WHATEVER YOU DEMAND FOR THE RELEASE OF HIS SON SAID THE CHIEF TO THE GERMAN MONARCH I WILL GIVE UP THE PRINCE ON THIS CONDITION ONLY WAS THE REPLY THE MAGYARS MUST LEAVE THE SOIL OF GERMANY IMMEDIATELY AND PROMISE NOT TO WAR ON US FOR NINE YEARS
2272-152265-0012 DURING THOSE YEARS I WILL PAY TO THE KING YEARLY FIVE THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD I ACCEPT THE TERMS IN THE KING'S NAME RESPONDED THE CHIEF THE PRINCE WAS THEREFORE GIVEN UP AND THE MAGYARS WITHDREW DURING THE NINE YEARS OF TRUCE KING HENRY PAID GREAT ATTENTION TO THE ORGANIZATION OF AN ARMY
2272-152265-0013 BEFORE THIS THE GERMAN SOLDIERS HAD FOUGHT CHIEFLY ON FOOT NOT AS THE MAGYARS DID ON HORSEBACK FOR THIS REASON THEY WERE AT A GREAT DISADVANTAGE IN BATTLE THE KING NOW RAISED A STRONG FORCE OF HORSEMEN AND HAD THEM DRILLED SO THOROUGHLY THAT THEY BECAME ALMOST INVINCIBLE
2272-152265-0014 THE INFANTRY ALSO WERE CAREFULLY DRILLED BESIDES THIS HENRY BUILT A NUMBER OF FORTS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF HIS KINGDOM AND HAD ALL THE FORTIFIED CITIES MADE STRONGER THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE MAGYAR CHIEF APPEARED AT THE GERMAN COURT AND DEMANDED A TENTH PAYMENT
