1874-89898-0000 AND THERE GIVING HIMSELF TO THE SERVICE OF THE MONKS HE STROVE DILIGENTLY TO LEARN AND TO PRACTISE THOSE THINGS
1874-89898-0001 AND BEING OF A READY WIT
1874-89898-0002 HAVING NOT YET RECEIVED THE TONSURE BUT BEING IN NO SMALL MEASURE MARKED BY THOSE VIRTUES OF HUMILITY AND OBEDIENCE WHICH ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE TONSURE FOR WHICH REASON HE WAS JUSTLY LOVED BY HIS ELDERS AND HIS EQUALS
1874-89898-0003 HE PERCEIVED THAT THE WAY OF VIRTUE DELIVERED BY THE SCOTS WAS IN NO WISE PERFECT AND HE RESOLVED TO GO TO ROME TO SEE WHAT ECCLESIASTICAL OR MONASTIC RITES WERE IN USE AT THE APOSTOLIC SEE
1874-89898-0004 WHEN HE TOLD THE BRETHREN THEY COMMENDED HIS DESIGN AND ADVISED HIM TO CARRY OUT THAT WHICH HE PURPOSED HE FORTHWITH WENT TO QUEEN EANFLED FOR HE WAS KNOWN TO HER AND IT WAS BY HER COUNSEL AND SUPPORT THAT HE HAD BEEN ADMITTED INTO THE AFORESAID MONASTERY
1874-89898-0005 HE ACQUIRED FROM THE TEACHING OF THAT SAME MASTER
1874-89898-0006 WHOM WILFRID AS HIS CLERK ATTENDED TO THE PLACE WHERE HE WAS TO BE BEHEADED BEING VERY DESIROUS THOUGH THE BISHOP STRONGLY OPPOSED IT TO DIE WITH HIM BUT THE EXECUTIONERS UNDERSTANDING THAT HE WAS A STRANGER AND OF THE ENGLISH NATION SPARED HIM AND WOULD NOT PUT HIM TO DEATH WITH HIS BISHOP
1874-89898-0007 AND THEREFORE FINDING HIM TO BE A CATHOLIC
1874-89898-0008 WHICH PLACE HE HAD FORMERLY GIVEN TO THOSE THAT FOLLOWED THE DOCTRINE OF THE SCOTS TO BUILD A MONASTERY THERE
1874-89898-0009 AND OTHER CANONICAL RITES ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF THE ROMAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH HE GAVE THE SAME TO HIM WHOM HE FOUND TO BE INSTRUCTED IN BETTER DISCIPLINE AND BETTER CUSTOMS
