3025-12971-0000 HE WAS AN ALMOST PERFECT TYPE OF THE PETTY SMALL TOWN MIDDLE CLASS LAWYER HE LIVED IN PANAMA PENNSYLVANIA HE HAD NEVER BEEN CAPTAIN OF ANYTHING EXCEPT THE CRESCENT VOLUNTEER FIRE COMPANY

3025-12971-0006 AND HE DESIRED NO SYSTEM OF ECONOMICS BEYOND THE CURRENT PLATFORM OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HE WAS AIMLESSLY INDUSTRIOUS CROTCHETY BUT KIND AND ALMOST QUIXOTICALLY HONEST
3025-12971-0007 HE BELIEVED THAT PANAMA PENNSYLVANIA WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ANYBODY THIS LAST OPINION WAS NOT SHARED BY HIS WIFE NOR BY HIS DAUGHTER UNA
3025-12971-0008 MISSUS GOLDEN WAS ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO ASPIRE JUST ENOUGH TO BE VAGUELY DISCONTENTED NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM TOIL AT THE ACQUISITION OF UNDERSTANDING AND KNOWLEDGE
3025-12971-0009 SHE HAD FLOATED INTO A COMFORTABLE SEMI BELIEF IN A SEMI CHRISTIAN SCIENCE AND SHE READ NOVELS WITH A CONVICTION THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN A ROMANTIC PERSON IF SHE HADN'T MARRIED MISTER GOLDEN

3025-12971-0012 THOUGH SHE NEVER WENT BEYOND BORROWING A FRENCH GRAMMAR FROM THE EPISCOPALIAN RECTOR AND LEARNING ONE CONJUGATION BUT IN THE PIONEER SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT SHE TOOK NO PART SHE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS QUITE LADYLIKE
3025-12971-0013 SHE WAS A POOR COOK AND HER HOUSE ALWAYS SMELLED STUFFY BUT SHE LIKED TO HAVE FLOWERS ABOUT SHE WAS PRETTY OF FACE FRAIL OF BODY GENUINELY GRACIOUS OF MANNER
3025-12971-0014 SHE REALLY DID LIKE PEOPLE LIKED TO GIVE COOKIES TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD BOYS AND IF YOU WEREN'T IMPATIENT WITH HER SLACKNESS YOU FOUND HER A WISTFUL AND TOUCHING FIGURE IN HER SLIGHT YOUTHFULNESS
3025-12971-0015 AND IN THE AMBITION TO BE A ROMANTIC PERSONAGE A MARIE ANTOINETTE OR A MISSUS GROVER CLEVELAND WHICH AMBITION SHE STILL RETAINED AT FIFTY FIVE
3025-12971-0016 AND IF THEY WERE REFUSED LET HER LIPS DROOP IN A MANNER WHICH ONLY A BRUTE COULD WITHSTAND SHE PLAINTIVELY ADMIRED HER EFFICIENT DAUGHTER UNA
3025-12971-0017 UNA GOLDEN WAS A GOOD LITTLE WOMAN NOT PRETTY NOT NOISY NOT PARTICULARLY ARTICULATE BUT INSTINCTIVELY ON THE INSIDE OF THINGS
3025-12971-0018 NATURALLY ABLE TO SIZE UP PEOPLE AND AFFAIRS SHE HAD COMMON SENSE AND UNKINDLED PASSION
3025-12971-0019 WITH A HEALTHY WOMAN'S SIMPLE LONGING FOR LOVE AND LIFE AT TWENTY FOUR UNA HAD HALF A DOZEN TIMES FANCIED HERSELF IN LOVE SHE HAD BEEN EMBRACED AT A DANCE
3025-12971-0020 AND FELT THE STIRRING OF A DESIRE FOR SURRENDER BUT ALWAYS A NATIVE SHREWDNESS HAD KEPT HER FROM AGONIZING OVER THESE AFFAIRS SHE WAS NOT AND WILL NOT BE A MISUNDERSTOOD GENIUS
3025-12971-0021 AN UNDEVELOPED ARTIST AN EMBRYONIC LEADER IN FEMINISM NOR AN UGLY DUCKLING WHO WOULD PUT ON A GEORGETTE HAT AND CAPTIVATE THE THEATRICAL WORLD SHE WAS AN UNTRAINED AMBITIOUS

3025-12971-0023 WITH TOO MUCH READING OF POPPY FLAVORED NOVELS SHE WANTED TO LEARN LEARN ANYTHING BUT THE GOLDENS WERE TOO RESPECTABLE TO PERMIT HER TO HAVE A JOB
3025-12971-0024 AND TOO POOR TO PERMIT HER TO GO TO COLLEGE FROM THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN WHEN SHE HAD GRADUATED FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL IN WHITE RIBBONS AND HEAVY NEW BOOTS AND TIGHT NEW ORGANDY TO TWENTY THREE
3025-12971-0025 SHE HAD KEPT HOUSE AND GONE TO GOSSIP PARTIES AND UNMETHODICALLY READ BOOKS FROM THE TOWN LIBRARY WALTER SCOTT RICHARD LE GALLIENNE HARRIET BEECHER STOWE MISSUS HUMPHRY WARD
3025-12971-0026 HOW TO KNOW THE BIRDS MY YEAR IN THE HOLY LAND HOME NEEDLEWORK SARTOR RESARTUS AND SHIPS THAT PASS IN THE NIGHT HER RESIDUE OF KNOWLEDGE FROM READING THEM
3025-12971-0027 WAS A DISBELIEF IN PANAMA PENNSYLVANIA SHE WAS LIKELY NEVER TO BE ANYTHING MORE AMAZING THAN A MOTHER AND WIFE WHO WOULD ENTERTAIN THE HONITON EMBROIDERY CIRCLE TWICE A YEAR
3025-12971-0028 THESE GLASSES MADE A BUSINESS LIKE CENTER TO HER FACE YOU FELT THAT WITHOUT THEM SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO CHILDISH HER MOUTH WAS AS KIND AS HER SPIRITED EYES BUT IT DROOPED
3025-12971-0029 HER BODY WAS SO FEMININELY SOFT THAT YOU REGARDED HER AS RATHER PLUMP BUT FOR ALL HER CURVING HIPS AND THE THICK ANKLES WHICH SHE CONSIDERED COMMON SHE WAS RATHER ANEMIC
3025-12971-0030 HER CHEEKS WERE ROUND NOT ROSY BUT CLEAR AND SOFT HER LIPS A PALE PINK HER CHIN WAS PLUCKY AND UNDIMPLED IT WAS USUALLY SPOTTED WITH ONE OR TWO UNIMPORTANT ERUPTIONS
3025-12971-0031 WHICH SHE KEPT SO WELL COVERED WITH POWDER THAT THEY WERE NEVER NOTICEABLE NO ONE EVER THOUGHT OF THEM EXCEPT UNA HERSELF TO WHOM THEY WERE TRAGIC BLEMISHES WHICH SHE TIMOROUSLY EXAMINED IN THE MIRROR
3025-12971-0032 BUT THEY KEPT STARTLING HER ANEW SHE WOULD SECRETLY TOUCH THEM WITH A WORRIED FOREFINGER AND WONDER WHETHER MEN WERE ABLE TO SEE ANYTHING ELSE IN HER FACE
3025-12971-0033 YOU REMEMBERED HER BEST AS SHE HURRIED THROUGH THE STREET IN HER TAN MACKINTOSH WITH ITS YELLOW VELVETEEN COLLAR TURNED HIGH UP AND ONE OF THOSE MODEST ROUND HATS TO WHICH SHE WAS ADDICTED
3025-12971-0034 SHE TRUSTED IN THE VILLAGE IDEAL OF VIRGINAL VACUOUSNESS AS THE TYPE OF BEAUTY WHICH MOST CAPTIVATED MEN THOUGH EVERY YEAR SHE WAS MORE SHREWDLY DOUBTFUL OF THE DIVINE SUPERIORITY OF THESE MEN
3025-12971-0035 A GOOD NAME A NUMBER OF DEBTS AND ELEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS IN LODGE INSURANCE THE FUNERAL WAS SCARCELY OVER BEFORE NEIGHBORS THE FURNITURE MAN THE GROCER THE POLITE OLD HOMEOPATHIC DOCTOR
3025-12971-0036 ALL RIGHT MINDED PERSONS AGREE THAT A GOOD NAME IS PRECIOUS BEYOND RUBIES BUT UNA WOULD HAVE PREFERRED LESS HONOR AND MORE RUBIES
3025-12971-0037 SHE WAS SO ENGAGED IN COMFORTING HER MOTHER THAT SHE SCARCELY GRIEVED FOR HER FATHER SHE TOOK CHARGE OF EVERYTHING MONEY HOUSE BILLS
3025-12971-0038 TO WEAR BLACK AND LOOK WAN SHE SOBBED ON UNA'S SHOULDER SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS LONELY AND UNA STURDILY COMFORTED HER AND LOOKED FOR WORK
3025-12971-0039 DEVOTING ALL OF HER CURIOSITY ALL OF HER YOUTH TO A WIDOWED MOTHER OF SMALL PLEASANTRIES A SMALL INCOME AND A SHABBY SECURITY THIRTY COMES AND THIRTY FIVE THE DAUGHTER AGES STEADILY
3025-12971-0040 AT FORTY SHE IS AS OLD AS HER UNWITHERING MOTHER SWEET SHE IS AND PATHETICALLY HOPEFUL OF BEING A PIANIST OR A NURSE NEVER QUITE RECONCILED TO SPINSTERHOOD
3025-12971-0041 THOUGH SHE OFTEN LAUGHS ABOUT IT OFTEN BY HER INSISTENCE THAT SHE IS AN OLD MAID SHE MAKES THE THOUGHT OF HER BARREN AGE EMBARRASSING TO OTHERS THE MOTHER IS SWEET TOO
3025-12971-0042 OR BE CONTENT TO STAY ALONE HAD SHE ACQUIRED INTERESTS SHE MIGHT HAVE MEANT SOMETHING IN THE NEW GENERATION BUT THE TIME FOR REVOLT PASSES
3025-12971-0043 HOWEVER MUCH THE DAUGHTER MAY LONG TO SEEM YOUNG AMONG YOUNGER WOMEN THE MOTHER IS USUALLY UNCONSCIOUS OF HER SELFISHNESS SHE WOULD BE UNSPEAKABLY HORRIFIED IF SOME BRUTAL SOUL TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS A VAMPIRE
3025-12971-0044 CHANCE CHANCE AND WASTE RULE THEM BOTH AND THE WORLD PASSES BY WHILE THE MOTHER HAS HER GAMES OF CARDS WITH DAUGHTER AND DEEMS HERSELF UNSELFISH BECAUSE NOW AND THEN SHE LETS DAUGHTER JOIN A PARTY
3025-12971-0045 ONLY TO HASTEN BACK TO MOTHER AND EVEN WONDERS WHY DAUGHTER DOESN'T TAKE AN INTEREST IN GIRLS HER OWN AGE THAT UGLY COUPLE ON THE PORCH OF THE APPLE SAUCE AND WASH PITCHER BOARDING HOUSE
3025-12971-0046 THE MOTHER A MUTE DWARFISH PUNCHINELLO AND THE DAUGHTER A DRAB WOMAN OF FORTY WITH A MOLE A WART A SILENCE THAT CHARMING MOTHER OF WHITE HAIR AND REAL LACE WITH THE WELL GROOMED DAUGHTER
3025-12971-0047 THAT COMFORTABLE MOTHER AT HOME AND DAUGHTER IN AN OFFICE BUT WITH NO SUITORS NO AMBITION BEYOND THE ONE AT HOME THEY ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER PHENOMENON
3025-12971-0048 THAT MOST TOUCHING MOST DESTRUCTIVE EXAMPLE OF SELFLESS UNSELFISHNESS WHICH ROBS ALL THE GENERATIONS TO COME BECAUSE MOTHER HAS NEVER BEEN TRAINED TO ENDURE THE LONG LONG THOUGHTS OF SOLITUDE
3025-12971-0049 BECAUSE SHE SEES NOTHING BY HERSELF AND WITHIN HERSELF HEARS NO DIVERTING VOICE THERE WERE MANY SUCH MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS IN PANAMA
3025-12971-0050 IF THEY WERE WEALTHY DAUGHTER COLLECTED RENTS AND SAW LAWYERS AND BELONGED TO A CLUB AND TRIED TO KEEP YOUTHFUL AT PARTIES IF MIDDLE CLASS DAUGHTER TAUGHT SCHOOL ALMOST INVARIABLY
3025-12971-0051 IF POOR MOTHER DID THE WASHING AND DAUGHTER COLLECTED IT SO IT WAS MARKED DOWN FOR UNA THAT SHE SHOULD BE A TEACHER NOT THAT SHE WANTED TO BE A TEACHER
3025-12971-0052 AFTER GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL SHE HAD SPENT TWO MISERABLE TERMS OF TEACHING IN THE SMALL WHITE DISTRICT SCHOOL FOUR MILES OUT ON THE BETHLEHEM ROAD
3025-12971-0053 SHE HATED THE DRIVE OUT AND BACK THE AIRLESS ROOM AND THE FOUL OUTBUILDINGS THE SHY STUPID STARING CHILDREN THE JOLLY LITTLE ARITHMETICAL PROBLEMS ABOUT WALL PAPER PILES OF LUMBER
3025-12971-0054 THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT NOTORIOUSLY INEFFICIENT WORKMEN WILL TAKE TO DO A CERTAIN PIECE OF WORK UNA WAS HONEST ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN HONEST TEACHER
3025-12971-0055 THAT SHE NEITHER LOVED MASSES OF OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN NOR HAD ANY IDEALS OF DEVELOPING THE NEW GENERATION BUT SHE HAD TO MAKE MONEY OF COURSE SHE WOULD TEACH
3025-12971-0056 WHEN SHE TALKED OVER AFFAIRS WITH HER TEARFUL MOTHER MISSUS GOLDEN ALWAYS ENDED BY SUGGESTING I WONDER IF PERHAPS YOU COULDN'T GO BACK TO SCHOOL TEACHING AGAIN
3025-12971-0057 EVERYBODY SAID YOU WERE SO SUCCESSFUL AND MAYBE I COULD GET SOME NEEDLEWORK TO DO I DO WANT TO HELP SO MUCH MISSUS GOLDEN DID APPARENTLY REALLY WANT TO HELP
3025-12971-0058 BUT SHE NEVER SUGGESTED ANYTHING BESIDES TEACHING AND SHE WENT ON RECKLESSLY INVESTING IN THE NICEST MOURNING MEANTIME UNA TRIED TO FIND OTHER WORK IN PANAMA
3025-12971-0059 SEEN FROM A BALLOON PANAMA IS MERELY A MOLE ON THE LONG HILL SLOPES BUT TO UNA ITS FEW STRAGGLY STREETS WERE A WHOLE COSMOS
3025-12971-0060 SHE KNEW SOMEBODY IN EVERY SINGLE HOUSE SHE KNEW JUST WHERE THE SUCCOTASH THE CAKE BOXES THE CLOTHES LINES WERE KEPT IN EACH OF THE GROCERY STORES AND ON MARKET SATURDAYS
3025-12971-0061 SHE COULD WAIT ON HERSELF SHE SUMMED UP THE WHOLE TOWN AND ITS POSSIBILITIES AND SHE WONDERED WHAT OPPORTUNITIES THE WORLD OUT BEYOND PANAMA HAD FOR HER SHE RECALLED TWO TRIPS TO PHILADELPHIA
3025-12971-0062 AND ONE TO HARRISBURG SHE MADE OUT A LIST OF OPENINGS WITH SUCH METHODICAL EXACTNESS AS SHE DEVOTED TO KEEPING THE DWINDLING LODGE INSURANCE FROM DISAPPEARING ALTOGETHER
3025-12971-0063 HERS WAS NO POETIC OUTREACH LIKE THAT OF THE YOUNG GENIUS WHO WANTS TO BE OFF FOR BOHEMIA IT WAS A QUESTION OF EARNING MONEY IN THE LEAST TEDIOUS WAY
3025-12971-0064 UNA WAS FACING THE FEMINIST PROBLEM WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE WORD FEMINIST MEANT THIS WAS HER LIST OF FAIR FIELDS OF FRUITFUL LABOR
3025-12971-0065 SHE COULD AND PROBABLY WOULD TEACH IN SOME HEN COOP OF PEDAGOGY SHE COULD MARRY BUT NO ONE SEEMED TO WANT HER EXCEPT OLD HENRY CARSON THE WIDOWER
3025-12971-0066 WHO CALLED ON HER AND HER MOTHER ONCE IN TWO WEEKS AND WOULD PROPOSE WHENEVER SHE ENCOURAGED HIM TO THIS SHE KNEW SCIENTIFICALLY SHE HAD ONLY TO SIT BESIDE HIM ON THE SOFA
3025-12971-0067 LET HER HAND DROP DOWN BESIDE HIS BUT SHE POSITIVELY AND UNGRATEFULLY DIDN'T WANT TO MARRY HENRY AND LISTEN TO HIS HAWKING AND HIS GRUMBLING FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE
3025-12971-0068 SOONER OR LATER ONE OF THE BOYS MIGHT PROPOSE BUT IN A SMALL TOWN IT WAS ALL A GAMBLE
3025-12971-0069 THERE WEREN'T SO VERY MANY DESIRABLE YOUNG MEN MOST OF THE ENERGETIC ONES WENT OFF TO PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK TRUE THAT JENNIE MC TEVISH HAD BEEN MARRIED AT THIRTY ONE
3025-12971-0070 WHEN EVERYBODY HAD THOUGHT SHE WAS HOPELESSLY AN OLD MAID YET HERE WAS BIRDIE MAYBERRY UNMARRIED AT THIRTY FOUR NO ONE COULD EVER UNDERSTAND WHY FOR SHE HAD BEEN THE PRETTIEST AND JOLLIEST GIRL IN TOWN
3025-12971-0071 SHE COULD GO OFF AND STUDY MUSIC LAW MEDICINE ELOCUTION OR ANY OF THAT AMAZING HODGE PODGE OF PURSUITS WHICH ARE PERMITTED TO SMALL TOWN WOMEN
3025-12971-0072 BUT SHE REALLY COULDN'T AFFORD TO DO ANY OF THESE AND BESIDES SHE HAD NO TALENT FOR MUSIC OF A HIGHER GRADE THAN SOUSA AND VICTOR HERBERT SHE WAS AFRAID OF LAWYERS
3025-12971-0073 BLOOD MADE HER SICK AND HER VOICE WAS TOO QUIET FOR THE NOBLE ART OF ELOCUTION AS PRACTISED BY SEVERAL SATIN WAISTED SEMI ARTISTIC LADIES WHO GAVE READINGS
3025-12971-0074 SHE COULD HAVE A JOB SELLING DRY GOODS BEHIND THE COUNTER IN THE HUB STORE BUT THAT MEANT LOSS OF CASTE SHE COULD TEACH DANCING BUT SHE COULDN'T DANCE PARTICULARLY WELL
3025-12971-0075 AND THAT WAS ALL THAT SHE COULD DO SHE HAD TRIED TO FIND WORK AS OFFICE WOMAN FOR DOCTOR MAYBERRY THE DENTIST IN THE OFFICE OF THE PANAMA WOOD TURNING COMPANY IN THE POST OFFICE
3025-12971-0076 AS LOFTY ENTHRONED CASHIER FOR THE HUB STORE PAINTING PLACE CARDS AND MAKING FANCY WORK FOR THE ART NEEDLEWORK EXCHANGE
3025-12971-0077 THE JOB BEHIND THE COUNTER IN THE HUB STORE WAS THE ONLY ONE OFFERED HER IF I WERE ONLY A BOY SIGHED UNA
3025-12971-0078 I COULD GO TO WORK IN THE HARDWARE STORE OR ON THE RAILROAD OR ANYWHERE AND NOT LOSE RESPECTABILITY
3025-12971-0079 SQUIRE UPDEGRAFF THE REAL ESTATE AND INSURANCE MAN THAT HER EXPERIENCE WITH CAPTAIN GOLDEN WOULD MAKE HER A PERFECT TREASURE IN THE OFFICE SQUIRE UPDEGRAFF HAD LEAPED UP AT HER ENTRANCE AND BLARED
3025-12971-0080 WELL WELL AND HOW IS THE LITTLE GIRL MAKING IT HE HAD SET OUT A CHAIR FOR HER AND HELD HER HAND BUT HE KNEW THAT HER ONLY EXPERIENCE WITH HER FATHER'S AFFAIRS HAD BEEN AN EFFORT TO BALANCE CAPTAIN GOLDEN'S ACCOUNT BOOKS
3025-12971-0081 WHICH WERE WORKS OF GENIUS IN SO FAR AS THEY WERE COMPOSED ACCORDING TO THE INSPIRATIONAL METHOD SO THERE WAS NOTHING VERY SERIOUS IN THEIR ELABORATE DISCUSSION OF GIVING UNA A JOB
3025-12971-0082 IT WAS HER LAST HOPE IN PANAMA SHE WENT DISCONSOLATELY DOWN THE SHORT STREET BETWEEN THE TWO STORY BUILDINGS AND THE ROWS OF HITCHED LUMBER WAGONS NELLIE PAGE THE TOWN BELLE
3025-12971-0083 TRIPPING BY IN CANVAS SNEAKERS AND A LARGE RED HAIR RIBBON SHOUTED AT HER AND CHARLIE MARTINDALE OF THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK NODDED TO HER BUT THESE EXQUISITES WERE TOO YOUNG FOR HER
3025-12971-0084 THEY DANCED TOO WELL AND LAUGHED TOO EASILY THE PERSON WHO STOPPED HER FOR A LONG CURBSTONE CONFERENCE ABOUT THE WEATHER WHILE MOST OF THE TOWN OBSERVED AND GOSSIPED WAS THE FATEFUL HENRY CARSON
