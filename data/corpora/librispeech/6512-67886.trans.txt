6512-67886-0000 NEVERTHELESS THE JACOBITES DID NOT DESPAIR ONE OF THE MOST ZEALOUS AMONG THEM A GENTLEMAN NAMED BULKELEY WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN ON TERMS OF INTIMACY WITH GODOLPHIN UNDERTOOK TO SEE WHAT COULD BE DONE
6512-67886-0001 HE CALLED AT THE TREASURY AND TRIED TO DRAW THE FIRST LORD INTO POLITICAL TALK THIS WAS NO EASY MATTER FOR GODOLPHIN WAS NOT A MAN TO PUT HIMSELF LIGHTLY INTO THE POWER OF OTHERS HIS RESERVE WAS PROVERBIAL
6512-67886-0002 AND HE WAS ESPECIALLY RENOWNED FOR THE DEXTERITY WITH WHICH HE THROUGH LIFE TURNED CONVERSATION AWAY FROM MATTERS OF STATE TO A MAIN OF COCKS OR THE PEDIGREE OF A RACEHORSE
6512-67886-0003 THE VISIT ENDED WITHOUT HIS UTTERING A WORD INDICATING THAT HE REMEMBERED THE EXISTENCE OF KING JAMES BULKELEY HOWEVER WAS NOT TO BE SO REPULSED
6512-67886-0004 HE CAME AGAIN AND INTRODUCED THE SUBJECT WHICH WAS NEAREST HIS HEART GODOLPHIN THEN ASKED AFTER HIS OLD MASTER AND MISTRESS IN THE MOURNFUL TONE OF A MAN WHO DESPAIRED OF EVER BEING RECONCILED TO THEM
6512-67886-0005 BULKELEY ASSURED HIM THAT KING JAMES WAS READY TO FORGIVE ALL THE PAST MAY I TELL HIS MAJESTY THAT YOU WILL TRY TO DESERVE HIS FAVOUR AT THIS GODOLPHIN ROSE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THE TRAMMELS OF OFFICE
6512-67886-0006 AND HIS WISH TO BE RELEASED FROM THEM AND PUT AN END TO THE INTERVIEW BULKELEY SOON MADE A THIRD ATTEMPT BY THIS TIME GODOLPHIN HAD LEARNED SOME THINGS WHICH SHOOK HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE STABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT
6512-67886-0007 HE BEGAN TO THINK AS HE WOULD HIMSELF HAVE EXPRESSED IT THAT HE HAD BETTED TOO DEEP ON THE REVOLUTION AND THAT IT WAS TIME TO HEDGE EVASIONS WOULD NO LONGER SERVE HIS TURN IT WAS NECESSARY TO SPEAK OUT
6512-67886-0008 HE SPOKE OUT AND DECLARED HIMSELF A DEVOTED SERVANT OF KING JAMES I SHALL TAKE AN EARLY OPPORTUNITY OF
6512-67886-0009 BUT TILL THEN I AM UNDER A TIE I MUST NOT BETRAY MY TRUST TO ENHANCE THE VALUE OF THE SACRIFICE WHICH HE PROPOSED TO MAKE HE PRODUCED A MOST FRIENDLY AND CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WHICH HE HAD LATELY RECEIVED FROM WILLIAM
6512-67886-0010 YOU SEE HOW ENTIRELY THE PRINCE OF ORANGE TRUSTS ME HE TELLS ME THAT HE CANNOT DO WITHOUT ME AND THAT THERE IS NO ENGLISHMAN FOR WHOM HE HAS SO GREAT A KINDNESS BUT ALL THIS WEIGHS NOTHING WITH ME
6512-67886-0011 IF THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY REALLY HAD SCRUPLES ABOUT BETRAYING HIS TRUST THOSE SCRUPLES WERE SOON SO EFFECTUALLY REMOVED THAT HE VERY COMPLACENTLY CONTINUED DURING SIX YEARS TO EAT THE BREAD OF ONE MASTER
6512-67886-0012 WHILE SECRETLY SENDING PROFESSIONS OF ATTACHMENT AND PROMISES OF SERVICE TO ANOTHER THE TRUTH IS THAT GODOLPHIN WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A MIND FAR MORE POWERFUL AND FAR MORE DEPRAVED THAN HIS OWN HIS PERPLEXITIES
6512-67886-0013 HAD BEEN IMPARTED TO MARLBOROUGH TO WHOM HE HAD LONG BEEN BOUND BY SUCH FRIENDSHIP AS TWO VERY UNPRINCIPLED MEN ARE CAPABLE OF FEELING FOR EACH OTHER AND TO WHOM HE WAS AFTERWARDS BOUND BY CLOSE DOMESTIC TIES
6512-67886-0014 MARLBOROUGH WAS IN A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION FROM THAT OF WILLIAM'S OTHER SERVANTS LLOYD MIGHT MAKE OVERTURES TO RUSSELL AND BULKELEY TO GODOLPHIN BUT ALL THE AGENTS OF THE BANISHED COURT STOOD ALOOF FROM THE TRAITOR OF SALISBURY
6512-67886-0015 THAT SHAMEFUL NIGHT SEEMED TO HAVE FOR EVER SEPARATED THE PERJURED DESERTER FROM THE PRINCE WHOM HE HAD RUINED JAMES HAD EVEN IN THE LAST EXTREMITY WHEN HIS ARMY WAS IN FULL RETREAT WHEN HIS WHOLE KINGDOM HAD RISEN AGAINST HIM DECLARED
6512-67886-0016 THAT HE WOULD NEVER PARDON CHURCHILL NEVER NEVER BY ALL THE JACOBITES THE NAME OF CHURCHILL WAS HELD IN PECULIAR ABHORRENCE AND IN THE PROSE AND VERSE WHICH CAME FORTH DAILY FROM THEIR SECRET PRESSES A PRECEDENCE IN INFAMY
6512-67886-0017 AMONG ALL THE MANY TRAITORS OF THE AGE WAS ASSIGNED TO HIM IN THE ORDER OF THINGS WHICH HAD SPRUNG FROM THE REVOLUTION HE WAS ONE OF THE GREAT MEN OF ENGLAND HIGH IN THE STATE HIGH IN THE ARMY HE HAD BEEN CREATED AN EARL
6512-67886-0018 HE HAD A LARGE SHARE IN THE MILITARY ADMINISTRATION THE EMOLUMENTS DIRECT AND INDIRECT OF THE PLACES AND COMMANDS WHICH HE HELD UNDER THE CROWN WERE BELIEVED AT THE DUTCH EMBASSY TO AMOUNT TO TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR
6512-67886-0019 IN THE EVENT OF A COUNTERREVOLUTION IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD NOTHING IN PROSPECT BUT A GARRET IN HOLLAND OR A SCAFFOLD ON TOWER HILL IT MIGHT THEREFORE HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD SERVE HIS NEW MASTER WITH FIDELITY
6512-67886-0020 NOT INDEED WITH THE FIDELITY OF NOTTINGHAM WHICH WAS THE FIDELITY OF CONSCIENTIOUSNESS NOT WITH THE FIDELITY OF PORTLAND WHICH WAS THE FIDELITY OF AFFECTION BUT WITH THE NOT LESS STUBBORN FIDELITY OF DESPAIR
6512-67886-0021 THOSE WHO THOUGHT THUS KNEW BUT LITTLE OF MARLBOROUGH CONFIDENT IN HIS OWN POWERS OF DECEPTION HE RESOLVED SINCE THE JACOBITE AGENTS WOULD NOT SEEK HIM TO SEEK THEM HE THEREFORE SENT TO BEG AN INTERVIEW WITH COLONEL EDWARD SACKVILLE
6512-67886-0022 SACKVILLE WAS ASTONISHED AND NOT MUCH PLEASED BY THE MESSAGE HE WAS A STURDY CAVALIER OF THE OLD SCHOOL HE HAD BEEN PERSECUTED IN THE DAYS OF THE POPISH PLOT FOR MANFULLY SAYING WHAT HE THOUGHT
6512-67886-0023 HE HAD PUT HIS NECK IN PERIL FOR KING JAMES HAD BEEN CHASED BY OFFICERS WITH WARRANTS AND HAD BEEN DESIGNATED AS A TRAITOR IN A PROCLAMATION TO WHICH MARLBOROUGH HIMSELF
6512-67886-0024 ROYALIST CROSSED THE HATED THRESHOLD OF THE DESERTER HE WAS REPAID FOR HIS EFFORT BY THE EDIFYING SPECTACLE OF SUCH AN AGONY OF REPENTANCE AS HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN WILL YOU
6512-67886-0025 SAID MARLBOROUGH BE MY INTERCESSOR WITH THE KING WILL YOU TELL HIM WHAT I SUFFER MY CRIMES NOW APPEAR TO ME IN THEIR TRUE LIGHT AND I SHRINK WITH HORROR FROM THE CONTEMPLATION THE THOUGHT OF THEM IS WITH ME DAY AND NIGHT
6512-67886-0026 I SIT DOWN TO TABLE BUT I CANNOT EAT I THROW MYSELF ON MY BED BUT I CANNOT SLEEP I AM READY TO SACRIFICE EVERY THING TO BRAVE EVERY THING TO BRING UTTER RUIN ON MY FORTUNES
6512-67886-0027 IF ONLY I MAY BE FREE FROM THE MISERY OF A WOUNDED SPIRIT IF APPEARANCES COULD BE TRUSTED THIS GREAT OFFENDER WAS AS TRUE A PENITENT AS DAVID OR AS PETER SACKVILLE REPORTED TO HIS FRIENDS WHAT HAD PASSED THEY COULD
6512-67886-0028 NOT BUT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF THE ARCH TRAITOR WHO HAD HITHERTO OPPOSED TO CONSCIENCE AND TO PUBLIC OPINION THE SAME COOL AND PLACID HARDIHOOD WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIM ON FIELDS OF BATTLE HAD REALLY BEGUN TO FEEL REMORSE
6512-67886-0029 IT WOULD BE ABSURD TO REJECT ON ACCOUNT OF HIS UNWORTHINESS THE INESTIMABLE SERVICES WHICH IT WAS IN HIS POWER TO RENDER TO THE GOOD CAUSE HE SATE IN THE INTERIOR COUNCIL HE HELD HIGH COMMAND IN THE ARMY
6512-67886-0030 HE HAD BEEN RECENTLY ENTRUSTED AND WOULD DOUBTLESS AGAIN BE ENTRUSTED WITH THE DIRECTION OF IMPORTANT MILITARY OPERATIONS IT WAS TRUE THAT NO MAN HAD INCURRED EQUAL GUILT BUT IT WAS TRUE ALSO THAT NO MAN HAD IT IN HIS POWER
6512-67886-0031 TO MAKE EQUAL REPARATION IF HE WAS SINCERE HE MIGHT DOUBTLESS EARN THE PARDON WHICH HE SO MUCH DESIRED BUT WAS HE SINCERE HAD HE NOT BEEN JUST AS LOUD IN PROFESSIONS OF LOYALTY ON THE VERY EVE OF HIS CRIME
6512-67886-0032 IT WAS NECESSARY TO PUT HIM TO THE TEST SEVERAL TESTS WERE APPLIED BY SACKVILLE AND LLOYD MARLBOROUGH WAS REQUIRED TO FURNISH FULL INFORMATION
6512-67886-0033 IT WAS THOUGHT A STILL STRONGER PROOF OF HIS FIDELITY THAT HE GAVE VALUABLE INTELLIGENCE
6512-67886-0034 A DEPOSITION HAD BEEN SWORN AGAINST ONE ZEALOUS ROYALIST A WARRANT WAS PREPARING AGAINST ANOTHER THESE INTIMATIONS SAVED SEVERAL OF THE MALECONTENTS FROM IMPRISONMENT IF NOT FROM THE GALLOWS AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM NOT TO FEEL
6512-67886-0035 SOME RELENTING TOWARDS THE AWAKENED SINNER TO WHOM THEY OWED SO MUCH HE HOWEVER IN HIS SECRET CONVERSATIONS WITH HIS NEW ALLIES LAID NO CLAIM TO MERIT HE DID NOT HE SAID ASK FOR CONFIDENCE HOW COULD HE
6512-67886-0036 AFTER THE VILLANIES WHICH HE HAD COMMITTED AGAINST THE BEST OF KINGS HOPE EVER TO BE TRUSTED AGAIN IT WAS ENOUGH FOR A WRETCH LIKE HIM TO BE PERMITTED TO MAKE AT THE COST OF HIS LIFE SOME POOR ATONEMENT TO THE GRACIOUS MASTER
6512-67886-0037 WHOM HE HAD INDEED BASELY INJURED BUT WHOM HE HAD NEVER CEASED TO LOVE IT WAS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT IN THE SUMMER HE MIGHT COMMAND THE ENGLISH FORCES IN FLANDERS WAS IT WISHED THAT HE SHOULD BRING THEM OVER IN A BODY TO THE FRENCH CAMP
6512-67886-0038 IF SUCH WERE THE ROYAL PLEASURE HE WOULD UNDERTAKE THAT THE THING SHOULD BE DONE BUT ON THE WHOLE HE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WAIT TILL THE NEXT SESSION OF PARLIAMENT AND THEN HE HINTED AT A PLAN WHICH HE AFTERWARDS MORE FULLY MATURED
6512-67886-0039 FOR EXPELLING THE USURPER BY MEANS OF THE ENGLISH LEGISLATURE AND THE ENGLISH ARMY IN THE MEANTIME HE HOPED THAT JAMES WOULD COMMAND GODOLPHIN NOT TO QUIT THE TREASURY A PRIVATE MAN COULD DO LITTLE FOR THE GOOD CAUSE ONE
6512-67886-0040 MIGHT RENDER INESTIMABLE SERVICES MARLBOROUGH'S PRETENDED REPENTANCE IMPOSED SO COMPLETELY ON THOSE WHO MANAGED THE AFFAIRS OF JAMES IN LONDON THAT THEY SENT LLOYD TO FRANCE WITH THE CHEERING INTELLIGENCE THAT THE MOST DEPRAVED OF ALL REBELS
6512-67886-0041 HAD BEEN WONDERFULLY TRANSFORMED INTO A LOYAL SUBJECT THE TIDINGS FILLED JAMES WITH DELIGHT AND HOPE HAD HE BEEN WISE THEY WOULD HAVE EXCITED IN HIM ONLY AVERSION AND DISTRUST IT WAS ABSURD TO IMAGINE THAT A MAN REALLY HEARTBROKEN
6512-67886-0042 BY REMORSE AND SHAME FOR ONE ACT OF PERFIDY WOULD DETERMINE TO LIGHTEN HIS CONSCIENCE BY COMMITTING A SECOND ACT OF PERFIDY AS ODIOUS AND AS DISGRACEFUL AS THE FIRST THE PROMISED ATONEMENT WAS SO WICKED AND BASE
6512-67886-0043 HE WAS LAUGHING AT THEM THE LOSS OF HALF A GUINEA WOULD HAVE DONE MORE TO SPOIL HIS APPETITE AND TO DISTURB HIS SLUMBERS THAN ALL THE TERRORS OF AN EVIL CONSCIENCE WHAT HIS OFFERS REALLY PROVED WAS THAT HIS FORMER CRIME HAD SPRUNG
6512-67886-0044 NOT FROM AN ILL REGULATED ZEAL FOR THE INTERESTS OF HIS COUNTRY AND HIS RELIGION BUT FROM A DEEP AND INCURABLE MORAL DISEASE WHICH HAD INFECTED THE WHOLE MAN JAMES HOWEVER
6512-67886-0045 PARTLY FROM DULNESS AND PARTLY FROM SELFISHNESS COULD NEVER SEE ANY IMMORALITY IN ANY ACTION BY WHICH HE WAS BENEFITED TO CONSPIRE AGAINST HIM TO BETRAY HIM TO BREAK AN OATH OF ALLEGIANCE SWORN TO HIM
6512-67886-0046 WERE CRIMES FOR WHICH NO PUNISHMENT HERE OR HEREAFTER COULD BE TOO SEVERE BUT TO MURDER HIS ENEMIES TO BREAK FAITH WITH HIS ENEMIES WAS NOT ONLY INNOCENT BUT LAUDABLE THE DESERTION AT SALISBURY
6512-67886-0047 HAD BEEN THE WORST OF CRIMES FOR IT HAD RUINED HIM A SIMILAR DESERTION IN FLANDERS WOULD BE AN HONOURABLE EXPLOIT FOR IT MIGHT RESTORE HIM THE PENITENT WAS INFORMED BY HIS JACOBITE FRIENDS THAT HE WAS FORGIVEN
6512-67886-0048 THE NEWS WAS MOST WELCOME BUT SOMETHING MORE WAS NECESSARY TO RESTORE HIS LOST PEACE OF MIND MIGHT HE HOPE TO HAVE IN THE ROYAL HANDWRITING TWO LINES CONTAINING A PROMISE OF PARDON
6512-67886-0049 IT WAS NOT OF COURSE FOR HIS OWN SAKE THAT HE ASKED THIS BUT HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT WITH SUCH A DOCUMENT IN HIS HANDS HE COULD BRING BACK TO THE RIGHT PATH SOME PERSONS OF GREAT NOTE WHO ADHERED TO THE USURPER ONLY BECAUSE THEY IMAGINED
6512-67886-0050 THAT THEY HAD NO MERCY TO EXPECT FROM THE LEGITIMATE KING THEY WOULD RETURN TO THEIR DUTY AS SOON AS THEY SAW THAT EVEN THE WORST OF ALL CRIMINALS HAD ON HIS REPENTANCE BEEN GENEROUSLY FORGIVEN THE PROMISE WAS WRITTEN SENT
6512-67886-0051 AND CAREFULLY TREASURED UP MARLBOROUGH HAD NOW ATTAINED ONE OBJECT AN OBJECT WHICH WAS COMMON TO HIM WITH RUSSELL AND GODOLPHIN BUT HE HAD OTHER OBJECTS WHICH NEITHER RUSSELL NOR GODOLPHIN HAD EVER CONTEMPLATED THERE IS
6512-67886-0052 AS WE SHALL HEREAFTER SEE STRONG REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WISE BRAVE WICKED MAN WAS MEDITATING A PLAN WORTHY OF HIS FERTILE INTELLECT AND DARING SPIRIT AND NOT LESS WORTHY OF HIS DEEPLY CORRUPTED HEART
6512-67886-0053 A PLAN WHICH IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FRUSTRATED BY STRANGE MEANS WOULD HAVE RUINED WILLIAM WITHOUT BENEFITING JAMES
6512-67886-0054 THE SUCCESSFUL TRAITOR MASTER OF ENGLAND AND ARBITER OF EUROPE THUS THINGS STOOD WHEN IN MAY SIXTEEN NINETY ONE WILLIAM AFTER A SHORT AND BUSY SOJOURN IN ENGLAND SET OUT AGAIN FOR THE CONTINENT
6512-67886-0055 WHERE THE REGULAR CAMPAIGN WAS ABOUT TO OPEN HE TOOK WITH HIM MARLBOROUGH WHOSE ABILITIES HE JUSTLY APPRECIATED
6512-67886-0056 SOLDIERS AND STATESMEN OF THE UNITED PROVINCES HEINSIUS LONG AFTER USED TO RELATE A CONVERSATION WHICH TOOK PLACE AT THIS TIME BETWEEN WILLIAM AND THE PRINCE OF VAUDEMONT ONE OF THE ABLEST COMMANDERS IN THE DUTCH SERVICE
6512-67886-0057 VAUDEMONT SPOKE WELL OF SEVERAL ENGLISH OFFICERS AND AMONG THEM OF TALMASH AND MACKAY BUT PRONOUNCED MARLBOROUGH SUPERIOR BEYOND COMPARISON TO THE REST HE HAS EVERY QUALITY OF A GENERAL HIS VERY LOOK SHOWS IT
6512-67886-0058 HE CANNOT FAIL TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING GREAT I REALLY BELIEVE COUSIN ANSWERED THE KING
6512-67886-0059 WITH ORDERS TO COLLECT ALL THE ENGLISH FORCES TO FORM A CAMP IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF BRUSSELS AND TO HAVE EVERY THING IN READINESS FOR THE KING'S ARRIVAL AND NOW MARLBOROUGH HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF PROVING THE SINCERITY
6512-67886-0060 OF THOSE PROFESSIONS BY WHICH HE HAD OBTAINED FROM A HEART WELL DESCRIBED BY HIMSELF AS HARDER THAN A MARBLE CHIMNEYPIECE THE PARDON OF AN OFFENCE SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE MOVED EVEN A GENTLE NATURE TO DEADLY RESENTMENT
6512-67886-0061 HE RECEIVED FROM SAINT GERMAINS A MESSAGE CLAIMING THE INSTANT PERFORMANCE OF HIS PROMISE TO DESERT AT THE HEAD OF HIS TROOPS HE WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS THE GREATEST SERVICE WHICH HE COULD RENDER TO THE CROWN HIS WORD WAS PLEDGED
6512-67886-0062 AND THE GRACIOUS MASTER WHO HAD FORGIVEN ALL PAST ERRORS CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED THAT IT WOULD BE REDEEMED THE HYPOCRITE EVADED THE DEMAND WITH CHARACTERISTIC DEXTERITY
6512-67886-0063 IN THE MOST RESPECTFUL AND AFFECTIONATE LANGUAGE HE EXCUSED HIMSELF FOR NOT IMMEDIATELY OBEYING THE ROYAL COMMANDS THE PROMISE WHICH HE WAS REQUIRED TO FULFIL HAD NOT BEEN QUITE CORRECTLY UNDERSTOOD
6512-67886-0064 WILLIAM ARRIVED AT THE HEAD QUARTERS OF THE ALLIED FORCES AND TOOK THE CHIEF COMMAND THE MILITARY OPERATIONS IN FLANDERS RECOMMENCED EARLY IN JUNE AND TERMINATED AT THE CLOSE OF SEPTEMBER
6512-67886-0065 NO IMPORTANT ACTION TOOK PLACE THE TWO ARMIES MARCHED AND COUNTERMARCHED DREW NEAR AND RECEDED DURING SOME TIME THEY CONFRONTED EACH OTHER WITH LESS THAN A LEAGUE BETWEEN THEM BUT NEITHER WILLIAM NOR LUXEMBURG
6512-67886-0066 WOULD FIGHT EXCEPT AT AN ADVANTAGE AND NEITHER GAVE THE OTHER ANY ADVANTAGE LANGUID AS THE CAMPAIGN WAS IT IS ON ONE ACCOUNT REMARKABLE DURING MORE THAN A CENTURY OUR COUNTRY HAD SENT NO GREAT FORCE TO MAKE WAR BY LAND
6512-67886-0067 IN THE BRILLIANT CIRCLE WHICH SURROUNDED LEWIS AT VERSAILLES
6512-67886-0068 WHO HAD NOT BEEN AT SOME BATTLE OR SIEGE BUT THE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF OUR PEERS BARONETS AND OPULENT ESQUIRES HAD NEVER SERVED EXCEPT IN THE TRAINBANDS
6512-67886-0069 A PART IN ANY MILITARY EXPLOIT MORE SERIOUS THAN THAT OF PUTTING DOWN A RIOT OR OF KEEPING A STREET CLEAR FOR A PROCESSION THE GENERATION WHICH HAD FOUGHT AT EDGEHILL AND LANSDOWNE HAD NEARLY PASSED AWAY
6512-67886-0070 THE WARS OF CHARLES THE SECOND HAD BEEN ALMOST ENTIRELY MARITIME DURING HIS REIGN THEREFORE THE SEA SERVICE HAD BEEN DECIDEDLY MORE THE MODE THAN THE LAND SERVICE AND REPEATEDLY WHEN OUR FLEET SAILED TO ENCOUNTER THE DUTCH
6512-67886-0071 SUCH MULTITUDES OF MEN OF FASHION HAD GONE ON BOARD THAT THE PARKS AND THE THEATRES HAD BEEN LEFT DESOLATE IN SIXTEEN NINETY ONE AT LENGTH FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HENRY THE EIGHTH LAID SIEGE TO BOULOGNE
6512-67886-0072 AN ENGLISH ARMY APPEARED ON THE CONTINENT UNDER THE COMMAND OF AN ENGLISH KING A CAMP WHICH WAS ALSO A COURT WAS IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTIVE TO MANY YOUNG PATRICIANS FULL OF NATURAL INTREPIDITY AND AMBITIOUS OF THE FAVOUR
6512-67886-0073 TO VOLUNTEER FOR FLANDERS BECAME THE RAGE AMONG THE FINE GENTLEMEN WHO COMBED THEIR FLOWING WIGS AND EXCHANGED THEIR RICHLY PERFUMED SNUFFS AT THE SAINT JAMES'S COFFEEHOUSE WILLIAM'S HEADQUARTERS WERE ENLIVENED BY A CROWD OF SPLENDID
6512-67886-0074 EQUIPAGES AND BY A RAPID SUCCESSION OF SUMPTUOUS BANQUETS FOR AMONG THE HIGH BORN AND HIGH SPIRITED YOUTHS WHO REPAIRED TO HIS STANDARD WERE SOME WHO THOUGH QUITE WILLING TO FACE A BATTERY
6512-67886-0075 IN A FEW MONTHS SHADWELL BROUGHT THESE VALIANT FOPS AND EPICURES ON THE STAGE THE TOWN WAS MADE MERRY WITH THE CHARACTER OF A COURAGEOUS BUT PRODIGAL AND EFFEMINATE COXCOMB WHO IS IMPATIENT TO CROSS SWORDS
6512-67886-0076 WITH THE BEST MEN IN THE FRENCH HOUSEHOLD TROOPS BUT WHO IS MUCH DEJECTED BY LEARNING THAT HE MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO HAVE HIS CHAMPAGNE ICED DAILY DURING THE SUMMER HE CARRIES WITH HIM COOKS CONFECTIONERS AND LAUNDRESSES
6512-67886-0077 A WAGGONLOAD OF PLATE A WARDROBE OF LACED AND EMBROIDERED SUITS AND MUCH RICH
