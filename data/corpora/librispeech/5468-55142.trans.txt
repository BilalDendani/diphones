5468-55142-0000 AND THE APPLAUSE HAD DIED AWAY IN A PLEASANT HUM OF CONVERSATION THAT AROSE FROM THE THRONG OF STUDENTS AND VISITORS THAT MORE THAN COMFORTABLY FILLED THE GYMNASIUM I DON'T SEE HOW THOSE GIRLS MANAGED TO ACCOMPLISH SO MUCH IN SO SHORT A TIME
5468-55142-0001 YES REPLIED MISS DUNCAN MISS HARLOWE SEEMS TO HAVE PLENTY OF INITIATIVE SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THIS NEW CLUB
5468-55142-0002 I UNDERSTAND THEIR TREASURY IS ALREADY IN A FLOURISHING CONDITION THANKS TO THEIR OWN EFFORTS AND A TIMELY CONTRIBUTION THEY RECEIVED AFTER THEIR CONCERT LAST SPRING I CONSIDER MISS HARLOWE THE FINEST TYPE OF YOUNG WOMAN I HAVE ENCOUNTERED DURING ALL MY YEARS OF TEACHING

5468-55142-0004 GRACE HAD PAUSED FOR A MOMENT OUTSIDE THE GYPSY ENCAMPMENT TO CAST A SPECULATIVE EYE OVER THE CROWD WHICH SEEMED TO BE STEADILY INCREASING
5468-55142-0005 WHO HAD COME UP AND NOW STOOD BESIDE HER
5468-55142-0006 I DO HOPE EVERYONE WILL LIKE THE BAZAAR AND HAVE A GOOD TIME THIS AFTERNOON AND TO NIGHT EVERYTHING HAS GONE SO BEAUTIFULLY THERE HASN'T BEEN A SIGN OF A HITCH OH YES THERE WAS ONE HER FACE CLOUDED FOR A SECOND THEN SHE LOOKED AT ARLINE BRIGHTLY I'M NOT GOING TO THINK OF IT
5468-55142-0007 I THINK IT COUNTS DECLARED ARLINE STUBBORNLY I SHALL NEVER FORGET IT AS LONG AS I LIVE
5468-55142-0008 AND JUST WHAT WE INTENDED TO HAVE WHEN WE WANTED THE WHOLE THING TO BE A SURPRISE REALLY I THINK THE PERSON WHO TOLD THE TALES DID US A GOOD TURN AFTER ALL LAUGHED GRACE THE GIRLS WERE EVER SO MUCH MORE ANXIOUS TO ATTEND THE BAZAAR AFTER THEY HEARD OF THE CIRCUS
5468-55142-0009 EVERY GIRL LOVES ALICE IN WONDERLAND I THINK AND THEN THE SPHINX IS A FIRST CLASS SURPRISE ISN'T IT FUNNY CHUCKLED ARLINE WHO IN HER SHORT WHITE EMBROIDERED DRESS PALE BLUE SASH BLUE SILK STOCKINGS AND HEELLESS BLUE KID SLIPPERS
5468-55142-0010 TIED UP ON ONE SIDE WITH A BLUE RIBBON LOOKED EXACTLY AS LEWIS CARROLL'S IMMORTAL ALICE MIGHT HAVE LOOKED IF SHE HAD BEEN INSPIRED WITH LIFE ALICE WAS ALLOWED TO SHOW HERSELF TO THE PUBLIC BEFORE THE PERFORMANCE AND ON CATCHING SIGHT OF GRACE
5468-55142-0011 OF THE ZINGARI JINGLED THEIR TAMBOURINES IN THEIR FAMILIAR BUT EVER POPULAR SPANISH DANCE AND READ CURIOUS PINK PALMS ITCHING TO KNOW THE FUTURE ADJOINING THE GYPSY ENCAMPMENT WAS A DOLL SHOP OVER WHICH THE CUNNING FRESHMAN MYRA STONE
5468-55142-0012 DRESSED AS A SAILOR DOLL PRESIDED THEN CAME THE JAPANESE TEA SHOP WITH THE EMERSON TWINS AS PROPRIETORS LOOKING SO REALISTICALLY JAPANESE THAT ARLINE DECLARED SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE THEY WERE THE EMERSON TWINS
5468-55142-0013 WERE DISPENSING CAKES AND ICES TO A STEADILY INCREASING PATRONAGE THERE WAS A POSTCARD AND SOUVENIR BOOTH AROUND WHICH A CROWD SEEMED PERPETUALLY STATIONED THE SOUVENIRS CONSISTED MAINLY OF SMALL BLACK AND WHITE OR WATER COLOR SKETCHES
5468-55142-0014 FOUR THIRTY EIGHT THIRTY AND NINE THIRTY RESPECTIVELY IN WHICH WOULD APPEAR THE CELEBRATED ALICE IN WONDERLAND ANIMALS
5468-55142-0015 UNTIL THE PATRONS OF THE BAZAAR SHOULD ENTER THE GYMNASIUM BUT IN SOME MYSTERIOUS MANNER THE SECRET HAD LEAKED OUT EVEN THE IDENTITY OF CERTAIN ANIMALS WAS KNOWN AND WHEN THIS UNPLEASANT NEWS HAD REACHED THE EARS OF THE ANIMALS THEMSELVES A MEETING WAS CALLED
5468-55142-0016 WHICH ALMOST PUT AN END TO THE CIRCUS THEN AND THERE AFTER DUE CONSIDERATION THE PERFORMERS AGREED TO GO ON WITH THE SPECTACLE BUT MANY AND INDIGNANT WERE THE THEORIES ADVANCED AS TO THE MANNER IN WHICH THE NEWS HAD TRAVELED ABROAD THAT THE INFORMATION HAD GONE FORTH THROUGH A MEMBER OF THE CLUB
5468-55142-0017 OR ANY ONE TAKING PART IN THE CIRCUS NO ONE OF THEM BELIEVED COMPLETE OSTRACISM THREATENED THE OFFENDER OR OFFENDERS PROVIDED SHE OR THEY AS THE CASE MIGHT BE WERE DISCOVERED LATER THE MEMBERS OF THE CLUB WERE FORCED TO ADMIT THAT
5468-55142-0018 ALTHOUGH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE ACT WAS REPREHENSIBLE THE ACT ITSELF HAD SERVED ONLY AS A MEANS OF ADVERTISING AND HAD AROUSED THE CURIOSITY AND INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC AFTER SEVERAL EARNEST DISCUSSIONS ON THE PART OF THE CLUB
5468-55142-0019 THE ADMISSION FEE HAD BEEN FIXED AT TWENTY FIVE CENTS AND THE PUBLIC HAD BEEN INVITED AS A COLLEGE TOWN OVERTON'S PUBLIC WAS LARGELY MADE UP OF THE CLASSES RATHER THAN THE MASSES AND MANY OF THE VISITORS CLAIMED OVERTON AS THEIR ALMA MATER THE STUDENTS HOWEVER
5468-55142-0020 WERE THE HOPE ON WHICH THE CLUB BASED ITS DREAMS OF PROFIT NO GIRL COULD WALK AROUND THE GYMNASIUM WITHOUT SPENDING MONEY SHE COULDN'T RESIST THOSE DARLING SHOPS THEY ARE ALL TOO FASCINATING FOR WORDS ARLINE HAD DECLARED RAPTUROUSLY
5468-55142-0021 AS SHE AND GRACE WERE TAKING A LAST WALK AROUND THE GREAT GAYLY DECORATED ROOM BEFORE GOING TO LUNCHEON THAT DAY NOW AS THEY STOOD SIDE BY SIDE ANXIOUSLY WATCHING THE STEADILY INCREASING TIDE OF VISITORS
5468-55142-0022 AND ISN'T SHE GREAT HOW DID EMMA HAPPEN TO THINK OF HER LET ALONE GETTING HER UP
5468-55142-0023 THIS ONE IS SMILED GRACE THEN HER FACE SOBERED INSTANTLY I HOPE NO ONE ELSE BESIDES OURSELVES FINDS OUT
5468-55142-0024 I THINK THE IDEA IS SIMPLY GREAT DON'T YOU
5468-55142-0025 COME ON OVER AND SEE HER SHE COAXED A MOMENT LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE THE ENTRANCE TO A SMALL TENT HUNG WITH A HEAVY CURTAIN
5468-55142-0026 THEN THEY PAUSED BEFORE A PLATFORM ABOUT FOUR FEET IN HEIGHT ON WHICH REPOSED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A GIGANTIC SPHINX HER PAWS STIFFLY FOLDED IN FRONT OF HER ASK ME A QUESTION
5468-55142-0027 THIS SUDDEN MYSTERIOUS CROAK THAT ISSUED FROM INSIDE THE GREAT HEAD CAUSED ARLINE TO START AND STEP BACK ASK ME A QUESTION I AM AS OLD AS THE WORLD
5468-55142-0028 ASKED ARLINE CURIOUSLY MYSTERY ALL IS MYSTERY CROAKED THE SPHINX BUT YOU SAID YOU WOULD ANSWER MY QUESTION PERSISTED ARLINE WHICH ONE PLAINTIVELY INQUIRED THE VOICE
5468-55142-0029 BOTH DECLARED ARLINE BOLDLY
5468-55142-0030 EMMA DEAN'S FAMILIAR DRAWL STARTLED BOTH GRACE AND ARLINE MY BROTHER HAD IT MADE FOR A COLLEGE PLAY CALLED SPHINX WHEN WE BEGAN TO PLAN FOR THE BAZAAR I SENT HOME FOR IT
5468-55142-0031 I MADE THE PAWS RATHER REALISTIC AREN'T THEY ALL THIS DRAPERY CAME WITH THE HEAD I AM INSIDE THE HEAD SITTING ON A STOOL IT'S RATHER DARK AND STUFFY
5468-55142-0032 THERE IS AN ARRANGEMENT INSIDE THE HEAD THAT MAKES PROMENADING POSSIBLE
5468-55142-0033 ANOTHER FEATURE WHEN SHALL WE HAVE IT WON'T THAT BE SPLENDID NOT THIS AFTERNOON LATE IN THE EVENING COUNSELED EMMA
5468-55142-0034 THEN ALBERTA WICKS MARY HAMPTON AND KATHLEEN WEST WERE USHERED INTO THE TENT I AM THE SPHINX BEGAN THE FAR AWAY VOICE AGAIN IN THE MAMMOTH HEAD ASK ME A QUESTION
5468-55142-0035 BOWING TO THE NEWCOMERS RATHER COLDLY GRACE AND ARLINE TURNED TO LEAVE THE TENT BUT GRACE REFLECTED GRIMLY AS SHE LIFTED THE TENT FLAP THAT IF ANY ONE OF THE TRIO HAD BEEN THE ALL WISE SPHINX INSTEAD OF HER FRIEND EMMA DEAN
5468-55142-0036 THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCONCERTING TO SAY THE LEAST
5468-55142-0037 OF HEARING THE SPHINX'S RIDICULOUS ANSWERS TO THEIR QUESTIONS AND INCIDENTALLY TO TRY IF POSSIBLE TO DISCOVER HER IDENTITY EMMA HAD SUCCEEDED IN CHANGING HER VOICE SO COMPLETELY THAT THE FAR AWAY ALMOST WAILING TONES OF THE EGYPTIAN WONDER
5468-55142-0038 HAD LITTLE IN COMMON WITH HER USUAL DRAWL SHE AND HER FAITHFUL ARAB HAD THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE ATTEMPTS OF THE VARIOUS GIRLS TO DISCOVER WHO WAS INSIDE THE GREAT HEAD AND VOLUMINOUS DRAPERY
5468-55142-0039 I DON'T BELIEVE ANY ONE OUTSIDE THE CLUB KNOWS EITHER
