4659-26488-0000 CHAPTER ELEVEN HOW DAVID UPON SAUL'S LAYING SNARES FOR HIM DID YET ESCAPE THE DANGERS HE WAS IN BY THE AFFECTION AND CARE OF JONATHAN
4659-26488-0001 HE WAS AFRAID AND BEING NOT ABLE TO CONCEAL HIS FEAR AS CONCERNING GREAT THINGS HIS KINGDOM AND HIS LIFE TO BE DEPRIVED OF EITHER OF WHICH WAS A VERY GREAT CALAMITY HE RESOLVED TO HAVE DAVID SLAIN
4659-26488-0002 AND COMMANDED HIS SON JONATHAN AND HIS MOST FAITHFUL SERVANTS TO KILL HIM BUT JONATHAN WONDERED AT HIS FATHER'S CHANGE WITH RELATION TO DAVID THAT IT SHOULD BE MADE TO SO GREAT A DEGREE FROM SHOWING HIM NO SMALL GOOD WILL TO CONTRIVE HOW TO HAVE HIM KILLED
4659-26488-0003 AND IF HE MET WITH A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY HE WOULD DISCOURSE WITH HIM ABOUT HIM AND LEARN THE CAUSE OF HIS DISGUST AND SHOW HOW LITTLE GROUND THERE WAS FOR IT AND THAT FOR IT HE OUGHT NOT TO KILL A MAN THAT HAD DONE SO MANY GOOD THINGS TO THE MULTITUDE
4659-26488-0004 AS SOON AS HE SAW HIM IN A CHEERFUL AND JOYFUL DISPOSITION AND BEGAN TO INTRODUCE A DISCOURSE ABOUT DAVID WHAT UNJUST ACTION O FATHER EITHER LITTLE OR GREAT HAST THOU FOUND SO EXCEPTIONABLE IN DAVID AS TO INDUCE THEE TO ORDER US TO SLAY A MAN WHO HATH BEEN OF GREAT ADVANTAGE TO THY OWN PRESERVATION
4659-26488-0005 AND AFTER THAT BROUGHT AS MANY HEADS OF OUR ENEMIES AS HE WAS APPOINTED TO BRING AND HAD AS A REWARD FOR THE SAME MY SISTER IN MARRIAGE INSOMUCH THAT HIS DEATH WOULD BE VERY SORROWFUL TO US NOT ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS VIRTUE BUT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEARNESS OF OUR RELATION
4659-26488-0006 FOR THY DAUGHTER MUST BE INJURED AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE IS SLAIN AND MUST BE OBLIGED TO EXPERIENCE WIDOWHOOD BEFORE SHE CAN COME TO ENJOY ANY ADVANTAGE FROM THEIR MUTUAL CONVERSATION CONSIDER THESE THINGS AND CHANGE YOUR MIND TO A MORE MERCIFUL TEMPER AND DO NO MISCHIEF TO A MAN WHO IN THE FIRST PLACE
4659-26488-0007 SAUL SENT DAVID WITH AN ARMY TO FIGHT WITH THEM AND JOINING BATTLE WITH THEM HE SLEW MANY OF THEM AND AFTER HIS VICTORY HE RETURNED TO THE KING BUT HIS RECEPTION BY SAUL WAS NOT AS HE EXPECTED UPON SUCH SUCCESS FOR HE WAS GRIEVED AT HIS PROSPERITY
4659-26488-0008 BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE WOULD BE MORE DANGEROUS TO HIM BY HAVING ACTED SO GLORIOUSLY BUT WHEN THE DEMONIACAL SPIRIT CAME UPON HIM AND PUT HIM INTO DISORDER AND DISTURBED HIM HE CALLED FOR DAVID INTO HIS BED CHAMBER WHEREIN HE LAY AND HAVING A SPEAR IN HIS HAND
4659-26488-0009 HE ORDERED HIM TO CHARM HIM WITH PLAYING ON HIS HARP AND WITH SINGING HYMNS WHICH WHEN DAVID DID AT HIS COMMAND HE WITH GREAT FORCE THREW THE SPEAR AT HIM BUT DAVID WAS AWARE OF IT BEFORE IT CAME AND AVOIDED IT AND FLED TO HIS OWN HOUSE
4659-26488-0010 THAT HE MIGHT COME INTO THE JUDGMENT HALL AND SO MIGHT BE DELIVERED UP AND CONDEMNED AND SLAIN
4659-26488-0011 AS HAVING SMALL HOPES OF HIS DELIVERANCE AND AS GREATLY CONCERNED ABOUT HER OWN LIFE ALSO FOR SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO LIVE IN CASE SHE WERE DEPRIVED OF HIM AND SHE SAID LET NOT THE SUN FIND THEE HERE WHEN IT RISES FOR IF IT DO THAT WILL BE THE LAST TIME IT WILL SEE THEE
4659-26488-0012 SO WHEN THOSE THAT WERE SENT TOLD SAUL THAT DAVID HAD NOT BEEN WELL IN THE NIGHT HE ORDERED HIM TO BE BROUGHT IN THAT CONDITION FOR HE INTENDED TO KILL HIM NOW WHEN THEY CAME AND UNCOVERED THE BED AND FOUND OUT THE WOMAN'S CONTRIVANCE THEY TOLD IT TO THE KING AND WHEN HER FATHER COMPLAINED OF HER THAT SHE HAD SAVED HIS ENEMY
4659-26488-0013 AND WHEN THEY CAME TO SAMUEL AND FOUND THERE A CONGREGATION OF PROPHETS THEY BECAME PARTAKERS OF THE DIVINE SPIRIT AND BEGAN TO PROPHESY WHICH WHEN SAUL HEARD OF HE SENT OTHERS TO DAVID WHO PROPHESYING IN LIKE MANNER AS DID THE FIRST HE AGAIN SENT OTHERS
4659-26488-0014 WHICH THIRD SORT PROPHESYING ALSO AT LAST HE WAS ANGRY AND WENT THITHER IN GREAT HASTE HIMSELF AND WHEN HE WAS JUST BY THE PLACE SAMUEL BEFORE HE SAW HIM MADE HIM PROPHESY ALSO
4659-26488-0015 NOR TO THE CALUMNIES OF THOSE THAT RAISED THOSE REPORTS IF THERE WERE ANY THAT DID SO BUT TO DEPEND ON HIM AND TAKE COURAGE FOR THAT HIS FATHER HAD NO SUCH INTENTION SINCE HE WOULD HAVE ACQUAINTED HIM WITH THAT MATTER AND HAVE TAKEN HIS ADVICE HAD IT BEEN SO
4659-26488-0016 HE ASKED HIM WHAT HE WOULD HAVE HIM DO FOR HIM TO WHICH DAVID REPLIED I AM SENSIBLE THAT THOU ART WILLING TO GRATIFY ME IN EVERY THING AND PROCURE ME WHAT I DESIRE NOW TOMORROW IS THE NEW MOON AND I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SIT DOWN THEN WITH THE KING AT SUPPER
4659-26488-0017 THAT THOU GAVEST ME LEAVE SO TO DO AND IF HE SAY AS IS USUALLY SAID IN THE CASE OF FRIENDS THAT ARE GONE ABROAD IT IS WELL THAT HE WENT THEN ASSURE THYSELF THAT NO LATENT MISCHIEF OR ENMITY MAY BE FEARED AT HIS HAND BUT IF HE ANSWER OTHERWISE
4659-26488-0018 THAT WILL BE A SURE SIGN THAT HE HATH SOME DESIGNS AGAINST ME ACCORDINGLY THOU SHALT INFORM ME OF THY FATHER'S INCLINATIONS AND THAT OUT OF PITY TO MY CASE AND OUT OF THY FRIENDSHIP FOR ME AS INSTANCES OF WHICH FRIENDSHIP THOU HAST VOUCHSAFED TO ACCEPT OF THE ASSURANCES OF MY LOVE TO THEE
4659-26488-0019 AND PROMISED TO DO WHAT HE DESIRED OF HIM AND TO INFORM HIM IF HIS FATHER'S ANSWERS IMPLIED ANY THING OF A MELANCHOLY NATURE AND ANY ENMITY AGAINST HIM AND THAT HE MIGHT THE MORE FIRMLY DEPEND UPON HIM HE TOOK HIM OUT INTO THE OPEN FIELD INTO THE PURE AIR
4659-26488-0020 AND SWARE THAT HE WOULD NEGLECT NOTHING THAT MIGHT TEND TO THE PRESERVATION OF DAVID AND HE SAID I APPEAL TO THAT GOD WHO AS THOU SEEST IS DIFFUSED EVERY WHERE AND KNOWETH THIS INTENTION OF MINE BEFORE I EXPLAIN IT IN WORDS
4659-26488-0021 AS THE WITNESS OF THIS MY COVENANT WITH THEE THAT I WILL NOT LEAVE OFF TO MAKE FREQUENT TRIMS OF THE PURPOSE OF MY FATHER TILL I LEARN WHETHER THERE BE ANY LURKING DISTEMPER IN THE MOST SECRET PARTS OF HIS SOUL AND WHEN I HAVE LEARNT IT I WILL NOT CONCEAL IT FROM THEE BUT WILL DISCOVER IT TO THEE
4659-26488-0022 WHETHER HE BE GENTLY OR PEEVISHLY DISPOSED FOR THIS GOD HIMSELF KNOWS THAT I PRAY HE MAY ALWAYS BE WITH THEE FOR HE IS WITH THEE NOW AND WILL NOT FORSAKE THEE AND WILL MAKE THEE SUPERIOR TO THINE ENEMIES WHETHER MY FATHER BE ONE OF THEM
4659-26488-0023 OR WHETHER I MYSELF BE SUCH DO THOU ONLY REMEMBER WHAT WE NOW DO AND IF IT FALL OUT THAT I DIE PRESERVE MY CHILDREN ALIVE AND REQUITE WHAT KINDNESS THOU HAST NOW RECEIVED TO THEM WHEN HE HAD THUS SWORN HE DISMISSED DAVID
4659-26488-0024 AND THEN BID MY SERVANT TO CARRY THESE THREE DARTS AWAY FOR THEY ARE BEFORE HIM KNOW THOU THAT THERE IS NO MISCHIEF TO BE FEARED FROM MY FATHER BUT IF THOU HEAREST ME SAY THE CONTRARY EXPECT THE CONTRARY FROM THE KING
4659-26488-0025 HOWEVER THOU SHALT GAIN SECURITY BY MY MEANS AND SHALT BY NO MEANS SUFFER ANY HARM BUT SEE THOU DOST NOT FORGET WHAT I HAVE DESIRED OF THEE IN THE TIME OF THY PROSPERITY AND BE SERVICEABLE TO MY CHILDREN NOW DAVID
4659-26488-0026 SUPPOSING THAT HE HAD NOT PURIFIED HIMSELF SINCE HE HAD ACCOMPANIED WITH HIS WIFE AND SO COULD NOT BE PRESENT BUT WHEN HE SAW THAT HE WAS NOT THERE THE SECOND DAY OF THE MONTH NEITHER HE INQUIRED OF HIS SON JONATHAN WHY THE SON OF JESSE DID NOT COME TO THE SUPPER AND THE FEAST
4659-26488-0027 NEITHER THE DAY BEFORE NOR THAT DAY SO JONATHAN SAID THAT HE WAS GONE ACCORDING TO THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THEM TO HIS OWN CITY WHERE HIS TRIBE KEPT A FESTIVAL AND THAT BY HIS PERMISSION THAT HE ALSO INVITED HIM TO COME TO THEIR SACRIFICE AND SAYS JONATHAN
4659-26488-0028 IF THOU WILT GIVE ME LEAVE I WILL GO THITHER FOR THOU KNOWEST THE GOOD WILL THAT I BEAR HIM AND THEN IT WAS THAT JONATHAN UNDERSTOOD HIS FATHER'S HATRED TO DAVID AND PLAINLY SAW HIS ENTIRE DISPOSITION FOR SAUL COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIS ANGER BUT REPROACHED JONATHAN
4659-26488-0029 THEIR KINGDOM WAS NOT SECURE TO THEM YET DID HE BID HIM SEND FOR HIM THAT HE MIGHT BE PUNISHED AND WHEN JONATHAN SAID IN ANSWER WHAT HATH HE DONE THAT THOU WILT PUNISH HIM SAUL NO LONGER CONTENTED HIMSELF TO EXPRESS HIS ANGER IN BARE WORDS BUT SNATCHED UP HIS SPEAR
4659-26488-0030 AND LEAPED UPON HIM AND WAS DESIROUS TO KILL HIM HE DID NOT INDEED DO WHAT HE INTENDED BECAUSE HE WAS HINDERED BY HIS FRIENDS BUT IT APPEARED PLAINLY TO HIS SON THAT HE HATED DAVID AND GREATLY DESIRED TO DESPATCH HIM
4659-26488-0031 AND BEING UNABLE TO ADMIT ANY THING INTO HIS MOUTH FOR GRIEF HE WEPT ALL NIGHT BOTH BECAUSE HE HAD HIMSELF BEEN NEAR DESTRUCTION AND BECAUSE THE DEATH OF DAVID WAS DETERMINED BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS DAY HE WENT OUT INTO THE PLAIN THAT WAS BEFORE THE CITY
4659-26488-0032 AS GOING TO PERFORM HIS EXERCISES BUT IN REALITY TO INFORM HIS FRIEND WHAT DISPOSITION HIS FATHER WAS IN TOWARDS HIM AS HE HAD AGREED WITH HIM TO DO AND WHEN JONATHAN HAD DONE WHAT HAD BEEN THUS AGREED HE DISMISSED HIS SERVANT THAT FOLLOWED HIM TO RETURN TO THE CITY
4659-26488-0033 BUT HE HIMSELF WENT INTO THE DESERT AND CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE AND COMMUNED WITH HIM SO DAVID APPEARED AND FELL AT JONATHAN'S FEET AND BOWED DOWN TO HIM AND CALLED HIM THE PRESERVER OF HIS SOUL BUT HE LIFTED HIM UP FROM THE EARTH
4659-26488-0034 AND THEY MUTUALLY EMBRACED ONE ANOTHER AND MADE A LONG GREETING AND THAT NOT WITHOUT TEARS THEY ALSO LAMENTED THEIR AGE AND THAT FAMILIARITY WHICH ENVY WOULD DEPRIVE THEM OF AND THAT SEPARATION WHICH MUST NOW BE EXPECTED
