91-123511-0000 LOVE MAKING ON MARS FOLLOWING THE BATTLE WITH THE AIR SHIPS THE COMMUNITY REMAINED WITHIN THE CITY FOR SEVERAL DAYS ABANDONING THE HOMEWARD MARCH UNTIL THEY COULD FEEL REASONABLY ASSURED THAT THE SHIPS WOULD NOT RETURN
91-123511-0001 FOR TO BE CAUGHT ON THE OPEN PLAINS WITH A CAVALCADE OF CHARIOTS AND CHILDREN WAS FAR FROM THE DESIRE OF EVEN SO WARLIKE A PEOPLE AS THE GREEN MARTIANS DURING OUR PERIOD OF INACTIVITY
91-123511-0002 TARS TARKAS HAD INSTRUCTED ME IN MANY OF THE CUSTOMS AND ARTS OF WAR FAMILIAR TO THE THARKS INCLUDING LESSONS IN RIDING AND GUIDING THE GREAT BEASTS WHICH BORE THE WARRIORS THESE CREATURES WHICH ARE KNOWN AS THOATS ARE AS DANGEROUS AND VICIOUS AS THEIR MASTERS BUT WHEN ONCE SUBDUED
91-123511-0003 TWO OF THESE ANIMALS HAD FALLEN TO ME FROM THE WARRIORS WHOSE METAL I WORE AND IN A SHORT TIME I COULD HANDLE THEM QUITE AS WELL AS THE NATIVE WARRIORS THE METHOD WAS NOT AT ALL COMPLICATED
91-123511-0004 THEY WERE DEALT A TERRIFIC BLOW BETWEEN THE EARS WITH THE BUTT OF A PISTOL AND IF THEY SHOWED FIGHT THIS TREATMENT WAS CONTINUED UNTIL THE BRUTES EITHER WERE SUBDUED OR HAD UNSEATED THEIR RIDERS
91-123511-0005 THOUGH UPON SOME OTHER BEAST IF NOT HIS TORN AND MANGLED BODY WAS GATHERED UP BY HIS WOMEN AND BURNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THARKIAN CUSTOM
91-123511-0006 MY EXPERIENCE WITH WOOLA DETERMINED ME TO ATTEMPT THE EXPERIMENT OF KINDNESS IN MY TREATMENT OF MY THOATS FIRST I TAUGHT THEM THAT THEY COULD NOT UNSEAT ME AND EVEN RAPPED THEM SHARPLY BETWEEN THE EARS TO IMPRESS UPON THEM MY AUTHORITY AND MASTERY
91-123511-0007 I WAS EVER A GOOD HAND WITH ANIMALS AND BY INCLINATION AS WELL AS BECAUSE IT BROUGHT MORE LASTING AND SATISFACTORY RESULTS I WAS ALWAYS KIND AND HUMANE IN MY DEALINGS WITH THE LOWER ORDERS
91-123511-0008 I COULD TAKE A HUMAN LIFE IF NECESSARY WITH FAR LESS COMPUNCTION THAN THAT OF A POOR
91-123511-0009 THEY WOULD FOLLOW ME LIKE DOGS RUBBING THEIR GREAT SNOUTS AGAINST MY BODY IN AWKWARD EVIDENCE OF AFFECTION AND RESPOND TO MY EVERY COMMAND WITH AN ALACRITY AND DOCILITY WHICH CAUSED THE MARTIAN WARRIORS TO ASCRIBE TO ME THE POSSESSION OF SOME EARTHLY POWER UNKNOWN ON MARS
91-123511-0010 ASKED TARS TARKAS ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD SEEN ME RUN MY ARM FAR BETWEEN THE GREAT JAWS OF ONE OF MY THOATS WHICH HAD WEDGED A PIECE OF STONE BETWEEN TWO OF HIS TEETH WHILE FEEDING UPON THE MOSS LIKE VEGETATION WITHIN OUR COURT YARD
91-123511-0011 BY KINDNESS I REPLIED YOU SEE TARS TARKAS THE SOFTER SENTIMENTS HAVE THEIR VALUE EVEN TO A WARRIOR IN THE HEIGHT OF BATTLE AS WELL AS UPON THE MARCH I KNOW THAT MY THOATS WILL OBEY MY EVERY COMMAND
91-123511-0012 AND THEREFORE MY FIGHTING EFFICIENCY IS ENHANCED AND I AM A BETTER WARRIOR FOR THE REASON THAT I AM A KIND MASTER YOUR OTHER WARRIORS WOULD FIND IT TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THEMSELVES AS WELL AS OF THE COMMUNITY TO ADOPT MY METHODS IN THIS RESPECT
91-123511-0013 ONLY A FEW DAYS SINCE YOU YOURSELF TOLD ME THAT THESE GREAT BRUTES BY THE UNCERTAINTY OF THEIR TEMPERS OFTEN WERE THE MEANS OF TURNING VICTORY INTO DEFEAT SINCE AT A CRUCIAL MOMENT THEY MIGHT ELECT TO UNSEAT AND REND THEIR RIDERS
91-123511-0014 SHOW ME HOW YOU ACCOMPLISH THESE RESULTS WAS TARS TARKAS ONLY REJOINDER AND SO I EXPLAINED AS CAREFULLY AS I COULD THE ENTIRE METHOD OF TRAINING I HAD ADOPTED WITH MY BEASTS AND LATER HE HAD ME REPEAT IT BEFORE LORQUAS PTOMEL AND THE ASSEMBLED WARRIORS
91-123511-0015 THAT MOMENT MARKED THE BEGINNING OF A NEW EXISTENCE FOR THE POOR THOATS
91-123511-0016 I HAD THE SATISFACTION OF OBSERVING A REGIMENT OF AS TRACTABLE AND DOCILE MOUNTS AS ONE MIGHT CARE TO SEE THE EFFECT ON THE PRECISION AND CELERITY OF THE MILITARY MOVEMENTS WAS SO REMARKABLE THAT LORQUAS PTOMEL PRESENTED ME WITH A MASSIVE
91-123511-0017 ANKLET OF GOLD FROM HIS OWN LEG AS A SIGN OF HIS APPRECIATION OF MY SERVICE TO THE HORDE ON THE SEVENTH DAY FOLLOWING THE BATTLE WITH THE AIR CRAFT WE AGAIN TOOK UP THE MARCH TOWARD THARK ALL PROBABILITY OF ANOTHER ATTACK BEING DEEMED REMOTE
91-123511-0018 DURING THE DAYS JUST PRECEDING OUR DEPARTURE I HAD SEEN BUT LITTLE OF DEJAH THORIS
91-123511-0019 AS WELL AS IN THE TRAINING OF MY THOATS THE FEW TIMES I HAD VISITED HER QUARTERS SHE HAD BEEN ABSENT WALKING UPON THE STREETS WITH SOLA OR INVESTIGATING THE BUILDINGS IN THE NEAR VICINITY OF THE PLAZA
91-123511-0020 I HAD WARNED THEM AGAINST VENTURING FAR FROM THE PLAZA FOR FEAR OF THE GREAT WHITE APES WHOSE FEROCITY I WAS ONLY TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HOWEVER SINCE WOOLA ACCOMPANIED THEM ON ALL THEIR EXCURSIONS AND AS SOLA WAS WELL ARMED
91-123511-0021 THERE WAS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE CAUSE FOR FEAR ON THE EVENING BEFORE OUR DEPARTURE I SAW THEM APPROACHING ALONG ONE OF THE GREAT AVENUES WHICH LEAD INTO THE PLAZA FROM THE EAST
91-123511-0022 I ADVANCED TO MEET THEM AND TELLING SOLA THAT I WOULD TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEJAH THORIS SAFEKEEPING I DIRECTED HER TO RETURN TO HER QUARTERS ON SOME TRIVIAL ERRAND I LIKED AND TRUSTED SOLA BUT FOR SOME REASON I DESIRED TO BE ALONE WITH DEJAH THORIS
91-123511-0023 WHO REPRESENTED TO ME ALL THAT I HAD LEFT BEHIND UPON EARTH IN AGREEABLE AND CONGENIAL COMPANIONSHIP THERE SEEMED BONDS OF MUTUAL INTEREST BETWEEN US AS POWERFUL AS
91-123511-0024 THAT SHE SHARED MY SENTIMENTS IN THIS RESPECT I WAS POSITIVE FOR ON MY APPROACH THE LOOK OF PITIFUL HOPELESSNESS LEFT HER SWEET COUNTENANCE TO BE REPLACED BY A SMILE OF JOYFUL WELCOME
91-123511-0025 AS SHE PLACED HER LITTLE RIGHT HAND UPON MY LEFT SHOULDER IN TRUE RED MARTIAN SALUTE SARKOJA TOLD SOLA THAT YOU HAD BECOME A TRUE THARK SHE SAID
91-123511-0026 NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROUD CLAIM OF THE THARKS TO ABSOLUTE VERITY DEJAH THORIS LAUGHED I KNEW THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU BECAME A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY YOU WOULD NOT CEASE TO BE MY FRIEND A WARRIOR MAY CHANGE HIS METAL BUT NOT HIS HEART AS THE SAYING IS UPON BARSOOM
91-123511-0027 I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO KEEP US APART SHE CONTINUED FOR WHENEVER YOU HAVE BEEN OFF DUTY ONE OF THE OLDER WOMEN OF TARS TARKAS RETINUE HAS ALWAYS ARRANGED TO TRUMP UP SOME EXCUSE TO GET SOLA AND ME OUT OF SIGHT
91-123511-0028 THEY HAVE HAD ME DOWN IN THE PITS BELOW THE BUILDINGS HELPING THEM MIX THEIR AWFUL RADIUM POWDER AND MAKE THEIR TERRIBLE PROJECTILES YOU KNOW THAT THESE HAVE TO BE MANUFACTURED BY ARTIFICIAL LIGHT
91-123511-0029 THEIR BULLETS EXPLODE WHEN THEY STRIKE AN OBJECT WELL THE OPAQUE OUTER COATING IS BROKEN BY THE IMPACT EXPOSING A GLASS CYLINDER ALMOST SOLID IN THE FORWARD END OF WHICH IS A MINUTE PARTICLE OF RADIUM POWDER
91-123511-0030 THE MOMENT THE SUNLIGHT EVEN THOUGH DIFFUSED STRIKES THIS POWDER IT EXPLODES WITH A VIOLENCE WHICH NOTHING CAN WITHSTAND IF YOU EVER WITNESS A NIGHT BATTLE YOU WILL NOTE THE ABSENCE OF THESE EXPLOSIONS
91-123511-0031 I ASKED FEELING THE HOT BLOOD OF MY FIGHTING ANCESTORS LEAP IN MY VEINS AS I AWAITED HER REPLY ONLY IN LITTLE WAYS JOHN CARTER SHE ANSWERED NOTHING THAT CAN HARM ME OUTSIDE MY PRIDE
91-123511-0032 THEY KNOW THAT I AM THE DAUGHTER OF TEN THOUSAND JEDDAKS THAT I TRACE MY ANCESTRY STRAIGHT BACK WITHOUT A BREAK TO THE BUILDER OF THE FIRST GREAT WATERWAY
91-123511-0033 AT HEART THEY HATE THEIR HORRID FATES AND SO WREAK THEIR POOR SPITE ON ME WHO STAND FOR EVERYTHING THEY HAVE NOT AND FOR ALL THEY MOST CRAVE AND NEVER CAN ATTAIN LET US PITY THEM MY CHIEFTAIN
91-123511-0034 FOR EVEN THOUGH WE DIE AT THEIR HANDS WE CAN AFFORD THEM PITY SINCE WE ARE GREATER THAN THEY AND THEY KNOW IT
91-123511-0035 I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE SURPRISE OF MY LIFE BUT I DID NOT KNOW AT THAT TIME NOR FOR MANY MONTHS THEREAFTER YES I STILL HAD MUCH TO LEARN UPON BARSOOM I PRESUME IT IS THE BETTER PART OF WISDOM THAT WE BOW TO OUR FATE WITH AS GOOD GRACE AS POSSIBLE DEJAH THORIS
91-123511-0036 BUT I HOPE NEVERTHELESS THAT I MAY BE PRESENT THE NEXT TIME THAT ANY MARTIAN GREEN RED PINK OR VIOLET HAS THE TEMERITY TO EVEN SO MUCH AS FROWN ON YOU MY PRINCESS
91-123511-0037 AND GAZED UPON ME WITH DILATED EYES AND QUICKENING BREATH
91-123511-0038 WHICH BROUGHT ROGUISH DIMPLES TO THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH SHE SHOOK HER HEAD AND CRIED WHAT A CHILD A GREAT WARRIOR AND YET A STUMBLING LITTLE CHILD WHAT HAVE I DONE NOW I ASKED IN SORE PERPLEXITY
91-123511-0039 SOME DAY YOU SHALL KNOW JOHN CARTER IF WE LIVE BUT I MAY NOT TELL YOU AND I
91-123511-0040 SHE SOLILOQUIZED IN CONCLUSION THEN SHE BROKE OUT AGAIN INTO ONE OF HER GAY HAPPY LAUGHING MOODS JOKING WITH ME ON MY PROWESS AS A THARK WARRIOR AS CONTRASTED WITH MY SOFT HEART AND NATURAL KINDLINESS I PRESUME
91-123511-0041 THAT SHOULD YOU ACCIDENTALLY WOUND AN ENEMY YOU WOULD TAKE HIM HOME AND NURSE HIM BACK TO HEALTH SHE LAUGHED THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT WE DO ON EARTH I ANSWERED AT LEAST AMONG CIVILIZED MEN THIS MADE HER LAUGH AGAIN
91-123511-0042 SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT FOR WITH ALL HER TENDERNESS AND WOMANLY SWEETNESS SHE WAS STILL A MARTIAN AND TO A MARTIAN THE ONLY GOOD ENEMY IS A DEAD ENEMY FOR EVERY DEAD FOEMAN MEANS SO MUCH MORE TO DIVIDE BETWEEN THOSE WHO LIVE
91-123511-0043 A MOMENT BEFORE AND SO I CONTINUED TO IMPORTUNE HER TO ENLIGHTEN ME NO SHE EXCLAIMED IT IS ENOUGH THAT YOU HAVE SAID IT AND THAT I HAVE LISTENED AND WHEN YOU LEARN JOHN CARTER AND IF I BE DEAD
91-123511-0044 AND THAT I SMILED IT WAS ALL GREEK TO ME BUT THE MORE I BEGGED HER TO EXPLAIN THE MORE POSITIVE BECAME HER DENIALS OF MY REQUEST AND SO IN VERY HOPELESSNESS I DESISTED
91-123511-0045 DAY HAD NOW GIVEN AWAY TO NIGHT AND AS WE WANDERED ALONG THE GREAT AVENUE LIGHTED BY THE TWO MOONS OF BARSOOM AND WITH EARTH LOOKING DOWN UPON US OUT OF HER LUMINOUS GREEN EYE IT SEEMED THAT WE WERE ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE AND I AT LEAST
91-123511-0046 WAS CONTENT THAT IT SHOULD BE SO THE CHILL OF THE MARTIAN NIGHT WAS UPON US AND REMOVING MY SILKS I THREW THEM ACROSS THE SHOULDERS OF DEJAH THORIS AS MY ARM RESTED FOR AN INSTANT UPON HER I FELT A THRILL PASS THROUGH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING
91-123511-0047 SUCH AS CONTACT WITH NO OTHER MORTAL HAD EVEN PRODUCED AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SHE HAD LEANED SLIGHTLY TOWARD ME BUT OF THAT I WAS NOT SURE ONLY I KNEW THAT AS MY ARM RESTED THERE ACROSS HER SHOULDERS
91-123511-0048 LONGER THAN THE ACT OF ADJUSTING THE SILK REQUIRED SHE DID NOT DRAW AWAY NOR DID SHE SPEAK AND SO IN SILENCE WE WALKED THE SURFACE OF A DYING WORLD BUT IN THE BREAST OF ONE OF US AT LEAST HAD BEEN BORN THAT
91-123511-0049 WHICH IS EVER OLDEST YET EVER NEW I LOVED DEJAH THORIS THE TOUCH OF MY ARM UPON HER NAKED SHOULDER HAD SPOKEN TO ME IN WORDS I WOULD NOT MISTAKE
