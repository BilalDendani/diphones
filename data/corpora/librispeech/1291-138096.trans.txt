1291-138096-0021 HE IS HUMBLE AND HIDES IT IF INDEED IT STILL EXISTS ONLY IN LEGEND DOES THE SINNER COME FORTH PENITENT BUT TERRIBLE TO CONQUER PURE WOMAN BY HIS RESISTLESS POWER HENRY WAS ANXIOUS TO BE TERRIBLE BUT HAD NOT GOT IT IN HIM
1291-138096-0022 IT WAS A VERY SIMPLE STORY TEN YEARS AGO WAS THE TIME A GARRISON TOWN IN CYPRUS THE PLACE NOW AND THEN HE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE COULD POSSIBLY FORGIVE HIM AND SHE ANSWERED I HAVE ALREADY FORGIVEN YOU HENRY
1291-138096-0023 SHE PLAYED THE GIRL UNTIL HE COULD REBUILD HIS FORTRESS AND HIDE HIS SOUL FROM THE WORLD WHEN THE BUTLER CAME TO CLEAR AWAY HENRY WAS IN A VERY DIFFERENT MOOD ASKED THE FELLOW WHAT HE WAS IN SUCH A HURRY FOR COMPLAINED OF THE NOISE LAST NIGHT IN THE SERVANTS HALL
1291-138096-0024 MARGARET LOOKED INTENTLY AT THE BUTLER HE AS A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN WAS FAINTLY ATTRACTIVE TO HER AS A WOMAN AN ATTRACTION SO FAINT AS SCARCELY TO BE PERCEPTIBLE
1291-138096-0025 ON HER RETURN FROM THE GEORGE THE BUILDING OPERATIONS WERE COMPLETE AND THE OLD HENRY FRONTED HER COMPETENT CYNICAL AND KIND HE HAD MADE A CLEAN BREAST HAD BEEN FORGIVEN AND THE GREAT THING NOW WAS TO FORGET HIS FAILURE
1291-138096-0026 AND TO SEND IT THE WAY OF OTHER UNSUCCESSFUL INVESTMENTS JACKY REJOINED HOWARDS END AND DUCIE STREET AND THE VERMILION MOTOR CAR AND THE ARGENTINE HARD DOLLARS
1291-138096-0027 AND ALL THE THINGS AND PEOPLE FOR WHOM HE HAD NEVER HAD MUCH USE AND HAD LESS NOW THEIR MEMORY HAMPERED HIM HE COULD SCARCELY ATTEND TO MARGARET WHO BROUGHT BACK DISQUIETING NEWS FROM THE GEORGE HELEN AND HER CLIENTS HAD GONE
1291-138096-0028 WELL LET THEM GO THE MAN AND HIS WIFE I MEAN FOR THE MORE WE SEE OF YOUR SISTER THE BETTER
1291-138096-0029 WHAT DID YOU SAY IN THE
1291-138096-0030 OH AH YES
1291-138096-0031 MARGARET TOOK HIS ARM THE BEAUTIFUL WEATHER SOOTHED HER BUT THE WHEELS OF EVIE'S WEDDING WERE STILL AT WORK TOSSING THE GUESTS OUTWARDS AS DEFTLY AS THEY HAD DRAWN THEM IN AND SHE COULD NOT BE WITH HIM LONG
1291-138096-0032 AND SHE BACK TO LONDON WITH THE WARRINGTONS FOR A FRACTION OF TIME SHE WAS HAPPY THEN HER BRAIN RECOMMENCED
1291-138096-0033 HELEN WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT UNLESS SHE HAD HEARD SOMETHING I MISMANAGED THAT IT IS WRETCHED I OUGHT TO HAVE PARTED HER FROM THAT WOMAN AT ONCE
1291-138096-0034 YES YES HENRY I AM FAR FROM A SAINT IN FACT THE REVERSE BUT YOU HAVE
1291-138096-0035 MARGARET A PROMISE IS A PROMISE NEVER MENTION THAT WOMAN AGAIN EXCEPT FOR SOME PRACTICAL REASON NEVER PRACTICAL YOU PRACTICAL YES I'M PRACTICAL
1291-138096-0036 SHE MURMURED STOOPING OVER THE MOWING MACHINE AND PLAYING WITH THE GRASS WHICH TRICKLED THROUGH HER FINGERS LIKE SAND HE HAD SILENCED HER BUT HER FEARS MADE HIM UNEASY
1291-138096-0037 THE BASTS KNEW THAT HE WAS NOT AND MIGHT FIND IT PROFITABLE TO HINT AS MUCH AT ALL EVENTS YOU MUSTN'T WORRY HE SAID THIS IS A MAN'S BUSINESS HE THOUGHT INTENTLY ON NO ACCOUNT MENTION IT TO ANYBODY
1291-138096-0038 MARGARET FLUSHED AT ADVICE SO ELEMENTARY BUT HE WAS REALLY PAVING THE WAY FOR A LIE IF NECESSARY HE WOULD DENY THAT HE HAD EVER KNOWN MISSUS BAST AND PROSECUTE HER FOR LIBEL PERHAPS HE NEVER HAD KNOWN HER
1291-138096-0039 HERE WAS MARGARET WHO BEHAVED AS IF HE HAD NOT THERE THE HOUSE ROUND THEM WERE HALF A DOZEN GARDENERS CLEARING UP AFTER HIS DAUGHTER'S WEDDING ALL WAS SO SOLID AND SPRUCE THAT THE PAST FLEW UP OUT OF SIGHT LIKE A SPRING BLIND
1291-138096-0040 LEAVING ONLY THE LAST FIVE MINUTES UNROLLED GLANCING AT THESE HE SAW THAT THE CAR WOULD BE ROUND DURING THE NEXT FIVE AND PLUNGED INTO ACTION GONGS WERE TAPPED ORDERS ISSUED
1291-138096-0041 MARGARET WAS SENT TO DRESS AND THE HOUSEMAID TO SWEEP UP THE LONG TRICKLE OF GRASS THAT SHE HAD LEFT ACROSS THE HALL AS IS MAN TO THE UNIVERSE SO WAS THE MIND OF MISTER WILCOX TO THE MINDS OF SOME MEN
1291-138096-0042 A CONCENTRATED LIGHT UPON A TINY SPOT A LITTLE TEN MINUTES MOVING SELF CONTAINED THROUGH ITS APPOINTED YEARS NO PAGAN HE WHO LIVES FOR THE NOW AND MAY BE WISER THAN ALL PHILOSOPHERS
1291-138096-0043 HE LIVED FOR THE FIVE MINUTES THAT HAVE PAST AND THE FIVE TO COME HE HAD THE BUSINESS MIND
1291-138096-0044 MARGARET HAD HEARD A CERTAIN RUMOUR BUT WAS ALL RIGHT
1291-138096-0045 CHARLES AND EVIE HAD NOT HEARD IT AND NEVER MUST HEAR NO MORE MUST PAUL OVER HIS CHILDREN HE FELT GREAT TENDERNESS WHICH HE DID NOT TRY TO TRACK TO A CAUSE MISSUS WILCOX WAS TOO FAR BACK IN HIS LIFE
1291-138096-0046 HE DID NOT CONNECT HER WITH THE SUDDEN ACHING LOVE THAT HE FELT FOR EVIE POOR LITTLE EVIE HE TRUSTED THAT CAHILL WOULD MAKE HER A DECENT HUSBAND AND MARGARET HOW DID SHE STAND SHE HAD SEVERAL MINOR WORRIES
1291-138096-0047 CLEARLY HER SISTER HAD HEARD SOMETHING SHE DREADED MEETING HER IN TOWN AND SHE WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT LEONARD
1291-138096-0048 NOR OUGHT MISSUS BAST TO STARVE BUT THE MAIN SITUATION HAD NOT ALTERED SHE STILL LOVED HENRY HIS ACTIONS NOT HIS DISPOSITION HAD DISAPPOINTED HER
1291-138096-0049 SHE GAZED BACK WITH DEEP EMOTION UPON ONITON BESIDES THE GRANGE AND THE CASTLE KEEP SHE COULD NOW PICK OUT THE CHURCH AND THE BLACK AND WHITE GABLES OF THE GEORGE THERE WAS THE BRIDGE AND THE RIVER NIBBLING ITS GREEN PENINSULA
1291-138096-0050 SHE COULD EVEN SEE THE BATHING SHED BUT WHILE SHE WAS LOOKING FOR CHARLES'S NEW SPRINGBOARD THE FOREHEAD OF THE HILL ROSE UP AND HID THE WHOLE SCENE SHE NEVER SAW IT AGAIN DAY AND NIGHT THE RIVER FLOWS DOWN INTO ENGLAND
1291-138096-0051 DAY AFTER DAY THE SUN RETREATS INTO THE WELSH MOUNTAINS AND THE TOWER CHIMES SEE THE CONQUERING HERO BUT THE WILCOXES HAVE NO PART IN THE PLACE NOR IN ANY PLACE
1291-138096-0052 IT IS NOT THEIR NAMES THAT RECUR IN THE PARISH REGISTER IT IS NOT THEIR GHOSTS THAT SIGH AMONG THE ALDERS AT EVENING
