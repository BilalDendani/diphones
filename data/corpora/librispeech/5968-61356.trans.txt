5968-61356-0001 SQUAWS WHO HAD NOT YET LEARNED THE DANCE SAT ON BOXES THE THREE FRIENDS CROWDED INTO THE ROOM AND STOOD WITH THEIR BACKS AGAINST THE WALL FRANK CORTE WAS BEATING TIME WITH HIS FOOT AND CLAPPING HIS HANDS WHILE HE SANG THE CALLS IN A WEIRD DRAWL HONOURS TO THE RIGHT
5968-61356-0002 EACH MAN BOWED MOST GRAVELY TO HIS PARTNER WHO MOST RESPECTFULLY RETURNED IT HONOURS TO THE LEFT
5968-61356-0003 AND THE SQUAWS WERE SO EXCITED THEY SEEMED TO OCCUPY MORE ROOM THAN REALLY THEY DID
5968-61356-0004 FOUR HAND ROUND DOS A BALNETTE RIGHT HAND TO PARTNER AND GRAND DOS A BALNETTE EVERY MAN TOOK HIS PARTNER'S RIGHT HAND AND WHEELED TO THE RIGHT AND THEN HER LEFT HAND THIS MOVEMENT BROUGHT THEM OPPOSITE AND SO THEY WERE IN A CIRCLE AT WHICH THEY BALANCED

5968-61356-0007 THE MUSIC WAS WEIRD AND DISCORDANT YET JOHN FOUND IT ALL VERY STIMULATING DANCE AFTER DANCE WAS GONE THROUGH WHILE HE STAYED AND WATCHED TILL THERE CAME TO HIS MIND PICTURES OF THE OLD HOME HIS FATHER'S HOUSE IN LONDON AND ALICE PEEL WAS SHE THINKING OF HIM
5968-61356-0008 SAY WHY DON'T YOU FELLOWS GET IN AND DANCE DREAMS AND FANCIES WERE REFT AWAY AS REALITY IN THE PERSON OF HASKINS OF THE SAW PITS STOOD BEFORE JOHN BERWICK
5968-61356-0009 A BEGINNER IN THE DANCE HIS HILARITY PROVOKED THE SQUAW AND AS THE DANCE PAUSED FOR A SECOND BETWEEN HER GASPS AND THROUGH HER PERSPIRATION SHE HISSED WITH A LOOK OF CONTEMPT CHE CHAC KA SAY YOU FELLOWS WILL HAVE TO GET IN AND DANCE IN THIS NEXT SET
5968-61356-0010 I SAW A SQUAW LOOKING AT YOU AND SAYING HEAP DAM DOOD
5968-61356-0011 HASKINS WAS AGAIN WORRYING THEM ALL RIGHT WHO WILL I ASK TO DANCE GEORGE WAS READY GO AND ASK THAT SQUAW SITTING IN THE CORNER SAID HASKINS POINTING ACROSS THE ROOM SHE IT WAS WHO HAD SAID HEAP DAM DOOD GEORGE WENT AND INVITED HER TO BE HIS PARTNER
5968-61356-0012 NI KA HALO INTRODUX YOU HAVE NOT BEEN INTRODUCED SHE ANSWERED THIS WAS MORE THAN GEORGE COULD WITHSTAND IN GRAVITY
5968-61356-0013 HE ONLY GUESSED THE MEANING OF THE WORDS SO HE REPEATED THEM TO HASKINS WHO THE DEVIL HAS TAUGHT THESE SAVAGES UP HERE CHINOOK IT'S A SPECIAL LINGO MANUFACTURED BY THE HUDSON BAY COMPANY TO SUIT THE SAVAGES AND WHEN WHITE MEN FIRST CAME INTO BRITISH COLUMBIA
5968-61356-0014 THEY FOUND THE SAVAGES WITH A LINGO WHICH WAS CALLED WHITE MAN'S WA WA AND WHICH NO PERSON COULD UNDERSTAND
5968-61356-0015 THE SIWASH CALLS AN ENGLISHMAN KING GEORGE MAN AND AN AMERICAN BOSTON MAN THE SQUAW IN THE CORNER WAS KEEPING HER EYE ON GEORGE WITH EVIDENT DISLIKE AS JOHN NOTICED THIS HE RECOMMENDED THEIR DEPARTURE SO GEORGE AND HE WENT BACK TO BED
5968-61356-0016 JOHN LOOKED UP AND SAW THE SMILING FACE OF FRANK AT HIS KITCHEN DOOR
5968-61356-0017 AND REALIZED THAT FRANK WAS SOMETHING OF A CONUNDRUM CORTE WHO WAS KNEADING BREAD TOOK A SEAT ON A BOX BY THE KITCHEN DOOR SAY DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR THIS COUNTRY IF UNCLE SAM WAS REALLY TO COME OVER AND TAKE IT I HOPE NOT WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH IT AS IT IS
5968-61356-0018 TOO MUCH POLICE TOO MUCH LAW AND ORDER YOU CAN NEVER HAVE A REAL LIVE MINING CAMP IN CANADA THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD DANCE YOU HAD FRIDAY NIGHT YES IT WAS ALL RIGHT
5968-61356-0019 BUT SAY THAT WAS A GOOD ONE WHEN THE SQUAW TOLD THE OTHER KING GEORGE MAN HE HAD NOT BEEN INTRODUCED TO HER FRANK CHUCKLED AND THEN AS THE PROSPECT OF AN INTERNATIONAL ARGUMENT DID NOT SEEM GOOD WENT ON ANOTHER TACK DO YOU BELIEVE THERE IS A GOD
5968-61356-0020 A FLOOD OF MEMORIES SURGED THROUGH BERWICK'S BRAIN HE GLANCED AT THE DARK SINISTER FEATURES OF THE MAN AWAITING HIS REPLY AND THEN LOOKED AT THE SUNLIGHT SHOULD HE GIVE SUCH AN ANSWER IN SUCH A TONE AS WOULD DISCOURAGE FURTHER ARGUMENT NO THE QUESTION WAS TOO SERIOUS
5968-61356-0021 HE MIGHT NOT HAVE FELT CALLED UPON AT ONE TIME TO DIVULGE HIS BELIEF WHICH IN THE PAST HAD BEEN A BURDEN OF MUCH QUESTIONING BUT HERE IT WAS ASKED PERHAPS IN LEVITY BY ONE WHO EVIDENTLY COULD NOT FULLY BELIEVE HE FELT CALLED UPON TO ANSWER YES I DO
5968-61356-0022 REALIZING THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH BERWICK REGARDED THE QUESTION HE FEARED LEST HE HAD HURT THE FEELINGS OF HIS GUEST THE ANSWER HE RECEIVED REASSURED HIM REMOVING HIS BIG ARMS FROM THE DOUGH AND GESTICULATING HE ANSWERED WELL PARTNER I DON'T NOW HERE'S THE PROPOSITION
5968-61356-0023 THOSE WHO SAY THERE IS A GOD SAY WHAT HE SET OUT TO DO THE FIRST THING GOD DONE WAS TO BUILD THE WORLD AND AFTER HE DONE THIS
5968-61356-0024 AND THEN HE PUTS ADAM AND EVE INTO IT AFTER HAVING MADE THEM HE TELLS THEM NOT TO EAT APPLES AND THEN HE GOES AND HAS A SNAKE WHICH TELLS THEM TO EAT APPLES AND BECAUSE THEY DO EAT APPLES HE PULLS UP THE RANCH AND KICKS THEM OUT
5968-61356-0025 BUT HE BRINGS ALL SORTS OF DISEASES AND PAINS ON EARTH THAT'S WHAT KEEPS ME FROM BELIEVING IN GOD NOW LOOK HERE IF GOD WAS ABLE TO MAKE THE EARTH AND THE STARS AND EVERYTHING WHY SHOULD HE NOT MAKE MAN AND LET HIM ENJOY ALL THIS SEEING THAT HE IS DOING IT ALL MORE OR LESS FOR AMUSEMENT
5968-61356-0026 WITHOUT PUTTING HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF A LOT OF GOOD THINGS AND THEN PUTTING UP A JOB ON HIM I'VE TALKED TO PARSONS ON THIS THING AND SOME OF THEM SAYS THAT AFTER HE BUST UP THE HOME RANCH HE KIND OF GOT SORRY AND SAYS HE WOULD SEND HIS SON ON EARTH TO DIE
5968-61356-0027 TO FIX UP THE BIG MISTAKE ADAM AND EVE MADE IN EATING ONE APPLE NOW SAY IF YOU WAS DOING ALL THIS WOULD YOU AFTER YOU MADE MAN AND PUT HIM ON THE EARTH AND HE DID WRONG WOULD YOU SEND YOUR SON TO FIX THINGS UP SO THAT THE CROWD WOULD GO AND NAIL HIM TO A BIG WOODEN CROSS
5968-61356-0028 BY DRIVING BIG STAKES THROUGH HIS HANDS AND FEET AND THEN STICK HIM UP FOR THE CROWS TO PECK AT IF GOD WAS NOT ABLE TO MAKE A MAN THE FIRST GO OFF WHO WOULD STAND A MILL TEST WHY DID HE NOT KILL HIM OFF BODY AND SOUL
5968-61356-0029 AND TRY AGAIN WITHOUT TRYING TO FIX THINGS UP BY MAKING HIS SON SUFFER THE WHOLE PROPOSITION AIN'T NATURAL AND WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF A MAN WHO IF HE FELL DOWN ON ANY PROPOSITION WOULD MAKE HIS SON GO AND SUFFER TO FIX UP HIS MISTAKES WHY DID HE NOT COME ON EARTH AND DIE ON THE CROSS HIMSELF
5968-61356-0030 AND SUFFER AND TURN THE EARTH AND ALL THE STARS AND THE REST OF IT OVER TO HIS SON TO RUN WHILE HE WAS GONE JOHN BERWICK WAS NOT BY NATURE ARGUMENTATIVE HAVING SELDOM IN HIS LIFE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE DRAWN INTO ANY BUT POLITICAL CONTROVERSY HE HAD IT IS TRUE
5968-61356-0031 DISCUSSED DOCTRINE AT COLLEGE WITH HIS CLASS MATES HE HAD READ MUCH PHILOSOPHY AND HAD PONDERED DEEPLY ON THE MYSTERY OF HUMAN SUFFERING THE DEEPEST OF ALL MYSTERIES HE HAD WEIGHED THE ARGUMENTS OF GREAT MINDS WHICH WANTED BELIEF IN GOD AND IN HIS OWN MIND
5968-61356-0032 HAD DONE MUCH TO SURMOUNT THE DIFFICULTY TO JUSTIFY THE WAYS OF GOD TO MAN BUT THE CRUDE INTELLECT BEFORE HIM HAD LAUNCHED FORTH A PROPOSITION HE COULD NOT CONFUTE HIS TRAINING IN RHETORIC AND IN THE DRAWING OF PARALLELS WAS OF USE ONLY AGAINST THE CULTURED MIND
5968-61356-0033 THE LEGEND OF THE SAXON KING DRAWING THE SIMILE OF LIFE FROM THE LITTLE BIRD WHICH FLEW WITHIN THE HALL FIRELIGHT AND WAS GONE AGAIN CAME TO HIS MIND BUT HE PUT IT ASIDE AS IMPOTENT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY HE SAID NOTHING FRANK CORTE WAS WORKING AT HIS BREAD AGAIN
5968-61356-0034 HIS FACE TWITCHING WITH A SMILE AND THEN THERE'S MISKITIES AND BLACK FLIES AND MOOSE FLIES AND BULL DOGS SAY WAIT A MONTH OR TWO TILL THE MISKITIES GET BUSY AND THEN TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW ANY GREAT AND GOOD GOD WOULD PUT SUCH THINGS ON EARTH
5968-61356-0035 WHY SHOULD GOD BECAUSE MAN WENT AND EAT AN APPLE MAKE ANIMALS SUFFER IN TRYING TO GET EVEN FRANK CORTE RETURNED TO THE KNEADING WHILE JOHN BERWICK THOUGHTFULLY WATCHED THE SUN FLOODED LANDSCAPE FRANK HE SAID AFTER A PAUSE
5968-61356-0036 THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING IS THE EATING I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANY ARGUMENT QUITE LIKE YOURS BUT MAN'S COMING TO THE WORLD HOW HE CAME TO THE WORLD AND WHETHER HE HAS A SOUL HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST SUBJECTS OF STUDY THROUGH THE AGES WE KNOW THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION
5968-61356-0037 WAS TAUGHT BACK TO WITHIN A FEW YEARS OF THE TIME CHRIST CAME ON EARTH AND FROM THAT TIME ON HAS GOT BIGGER IN POWER AND INFLUENCE OVER THE MINDS OF MEN SO THAT THE MAJORITY OF CIVILIZED PEOPLE GIVE JUSTICE TO THEIR FELLOWS BECAUSE THIS RELIGION TELLS THEM TO DO SO THE BIBLE
5968-61356-0038 TELLS A STORY OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN WHICH WE MAY OR MAY NOT BELIEVE THE BIBLE SAYS THERE IS A GOD AND GOD SEES BEST NOT TO EXPLAIN HIS SCHEMES AND WHY HE MAKES MAN AND ANIMALS SUFFER I BELIEVE THERE IS A GOD
5968-61356-0039 WHY NOT TRY TO BELIEVE THERE IS A GOD RATHER THAN ARGUE WITH YOURSELF AND OTHERS THAT THERE IS NO GOD IF THE CHRISTIAN BELIEF HAS MADE THE WORLD SO MUCH BETTER AS A WHOLE IT WILL MAKE YOU AND ME BETTER AS SINGLE MEN AND I KNOW YOU WOULD GIVE A MAN A MEAL IF HE WANTED IT
5968-61356-0040 OR IF A FELLOW WERE SICK YOU WOULD HELP HIM OUT ALL YOU COULD AND YOU'D EXPECT ME TO DO THE SAME IF YOU SAW A FELLOW DROWNING IN THE RIVER YOU'D HELP HIM OUT BUT THE CHINAMAN WHO IS NOT A CHRISTIAN WOULD LET HIM DROWN YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN ALL RIGHT BUT YOU DON'T KNOW IT
5968-61356-0041 THOUGH I DIDN'T LIKE TO SAY IT SERIOUS LIKE BUT THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD TALK OF YOURS AND SURE SOUNDS NATURAL SAY IS THAT OTHER KING GEORGE MAN WITH YOU AS GOOD A FELLOW AS YOU ARE SAY YOU'VE SET ME THINKING
