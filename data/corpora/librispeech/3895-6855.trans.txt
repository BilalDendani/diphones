3895-6855-0000 BUT SHE VERY LIKELY DID NOT TAKE HIS FANCY FOR CONTINUING TO WALK ON HE ADDRESSED TO THE MARSHAL THESE REMARKABLE WORDS WHICH JULIETTE MUST HAVE OVERHEARD WE HAVE HANDSOMER WOMEN HERE IN THE AFTERNOON I CALLED UPON THE VENETIAN AMBASSADOR
3895-6855-0001 I FOUND HIM IN NUMEROUS COMPANY WITH MADAME QUERINI SITTING ON HIS RIGHT SHE ADDRESSED ME IN THE MOST FLATTERING AND FRIENDLY MANNER IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT ON THE PART OF A GIDDY WOMAN WHO HAD NO CAUSE TO LIKE ME FOR SHE WAS AWARE THAT I KNEW HER THOROUGHLY
3895-6855-0002 AND THAT I HAD MASTERED HER VANITY BUT AS I UNDERSTOOD HER MANOEUVRING I MADE UP MY MIND NOT TO DISOBLIGE HER AND EVEN TO RENDER HER ALL THE GOOD OFFICES I COULD IT WAS A NOBLE REVENGE
3895-6855-0003 THE AMBASSADOR CONGRATULATED HER UPON HER MARRIAGE WITH HIM
3895-6855-0004 AND ADDING I WAS NOT AWARE OF YOUR MARRIAGE YET IT TOOK PLACE MORE THAN TWO YEARS SINCE SAID JULIETTE I KNOW IT FOR A FACT I SAID IN MY TURN
3895-6855-0005 FOR TWO YEARS AGO THE LADY WAS INTRODUCED AS MADAME QUERINI AND WITH THE TITLE OF EXCELLENCY BY GENERAL SPADA TO ALL THE NOBILITY IN CESENA WHERE I WAS AT THAT TIME I HAVE NO DOUBT OF IT ANSWERED THE AMBASSADOR FIXING HIS EYES UPON ME
3895-6855-0006 FOR QUERINI HAS HIMSELF WRITTEN TO ME ON THE SUBJECT A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS AS I WAS PREPARING TO TAKE MY LEAVE THE AMBASSADOR UNDER PRETENSE OF SOME LETTERS THE CONTENTS OF WHICH HE WISHED TO COMMUNICATE TO ME
3895-6855-0007 AND HE ASKED ME WHAT PEOPLE GENERALLY THOUGHT OF THE MARRIAGE IN VENICE NOBODY KNOWS IT AND IT IS EVEN RUMOURED THAT THE HEIR OF THE HOUSE OF QUERINI IS ON THE POINT OF MARRYING A DAUGHTER OF THE GRIMANI FAMILY
3895-6855-0008 SHE DID PERHAPS SHE HAS ALTERED HER MIND
3895-6855-0009 THEN I CAN GUESS REMARKED THE AMBASSADOR WHY JULIETTE DOES NOT WISH TO BE PRESENTED TO THE KING
3895-6855-0010 HAD CALLED AFTER MASS ON THE HANDSOME VENETIAN AND HAD TOLD HER THAT THE KING OF FRANCE HAD MOST CERTAINLY VERY BAD TASTE BECAUSE HE HAD NOT THOUGHT HER BEAUTY SUPERIOR TO THAT OF SEVERAL LADIES OF HIS COURT JULIETTE LEFT FONTAINEBLEAU THE NEXT MORNING
3895-6855-0011 IN THE FIRST PART OF MY MEMOIRS I HAVE SPOKEN OF JULIETTE'S BEAUTY
3895-6855-0012 AND HER BEAUTY WAS BEGINNING TO FADE WHEN SHE ARRIVED IN FONTAINEBLEAU I MET HER AGAIN IN PARIS AT THE AMBASSADOR'S AND SHE TOLD ME WITH A LAUGH THAT SHE HAD ONLY BEEN IN JEST WHEN SHE CALLED HERSELF MADAME QUERINI
3895-6855-0013 AND THAT I SHOULD OBLIGE HER IF FOR THE FUTURE I WOULD CALL HER BY HER REAL NAME OF COUNTESS PREATI SHE INVITED ME TO VISIT HER AT THE HOTEL DE LUXEMBOURG WHERE SHE WAS STAYING
3895-6855-0014 BUT I WAS WISE ENOUGH NOT TO MEDDLE WITH THEM
3895-6855-0015 SECRETARY OF THE VENETIAN EMBASSY AN AMIABLE AND LEARNED MAN HE WAS SO DEEPLY IN LOVE THAT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO MARRY HER BUT THROUGH A CAPRICE WHICH SHE PERHAPS REGRETTED AFTERWARDS SHE ILL TREATED HIM AND THE FOOL DIED OF GRIEF
3895-6855-0016 AS WELL AS THE COUNT OF ZINZENDORF THE PERSON WHO ARRANGED THESE TRANSIENT AND SHORT LIVED INTRIGUES WAS A CERTAIN GUASCO AN ABBE NOT OVER FAVOURED WITH THE GIFTS OF PLUTUS
3895-6855-0017 PARIS DID NOT PROVE AN EL DORADO FOR MY HANDSOME COUNTRYWOMAN FOR SHE WAS OBLIGED TO PLEDGE HER DIAMONDS AND TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND HER AFTER HER RETURN TO VENICE SHE MARRIED THE SON OF THE UCCELLI WHO SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE HAD TAKEN HER OUT OF HER POVERTY
3895-6855-0018 SHE DIED TEN YEARS AGO I WAS STILL TAKING MY FRENCH LESSONS WITH MY GOOD OLD CREBILLON YET MY STYLE WHICH WAS FULL OF ITALIANISMS
3895-6855-0019 BUT GENERALLY MY QUID PRO QUOS ONLY RESULTED IN CURIOUS JOKES WHICH MADE MY FORTUNE
3895-6855-0020 SEVERAL LADIES OF THE BEST SOCIETY BEGGED ME TO TEACH THEM ITALIAN
3895-6855-0021 MADAME PREODOT WHO WAS ONE OF MY PUPILS RECEIVED ME ONE MORNING
3895-6855-0022 FOOLISHLY TRANSLATING AN ITALIAN IDIOM I ASKED HER
3895-6855-0023 SIR WHAT A QUESTION YOU ARE UNBEARABLE I REPEATED MY QUESTION SHE BROKE OUT ANGRILY AGAIN NEVER UTTER THAT DREADFUL WORD YOU ARE WRONG IN GETTING ANGRY IT IS THE PROPER WORD A VERY DIRTY WORD SIR

3895-6855-0026 HOW DID YOU SWALLOW THEM SOAKED IN MY COFFEE FOR THEY WERE NOT LARGER THAN THESE ON YOUR TABLE AND YOU CALL THESE SAVOYARDS SAY BISCUITS IN ITALY WE CALL THEM SAVOYARDS BECAUSE THEY WERE FIRST INVENTED IN SAVOY
3895-6855-0027 BIG FELLOWS WHOM YOU CALL IN PARIS SAVOYARDS ALTHOUGH VERY OFTEN THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN IN SAVOY HER HUSBAND CAME IN AT THAT MOMENT AND SHE LOST NO TIME IN RELATING THE WHOLE OF OUR CONVERSATION HE LAUGHED HEARTILY BUT HE SAID I WAS RIGHT HER NIECE ARRIVED A FEW MINUTES AFTER
3895-6855-0028 I HAD GIVEN HER FIVE OR SIX LESSONS IN ITALIAN AND AS SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THAT LANGUAGE AND STUDIED DILIGENTLY
3895-6855-0029 IT LASTED A WEEK THAT UNCOUTH BLUNDER SOON GOT KNOWN THROUGHOUT PARIS AND GAVE ME A SORT OF REPUTATION WHICH I LOST LITTLE BY LITTLE BUT ONLY WHEN I UNDERSTOOD THE DOUBLE MEANINGS OF WORDS BETTER
3895-6855-0030 CREBILLON WAS MUCH AMUSED WITH MY BLUNDER AND HE TOLD ME THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE SAID AFTER INSTEAD OF BEHIND AH WHY HAVE NOT ALL LANGUAGES THE SAME GENIUS BUT IF THE FRENCH LAUGHED AT MY MISTAKES IN SPEAKING THEIR LANGUAGE
3895-6855-0031 I TOOK MY REVENGE AMPLY BY TURNING SOME OF THEIR IDIOMS INTO RIDICULE SIR I ONCE SAID TO A GENTLEMAN HOW IS YOUR WIFE YOU DO HER GREAT HONOUR SIR
3895-6855-0032 I MEET IN THE BOIS DE BOULOGNE A YOUNG MAN RIDING A HORSE WHICH HE CANNOT MASTER AND AT LAST HE IS THROWN I STOP THE HORSE RUN TO THE ASSISTANCE OF THE YOUNG MAN AND HELP HIM UP DID YOU HURT YOURSELF SIR OH MANY THANKS SIR AU CONTRAIRE
3895-6855-0033 WHY AU CONTRAIRE THE DEUCE IT HAS DONE YOU GOOD THEN BEGIN AGAIN SIR AND A THOUSAND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ENTIRELY THE REVERSE OF GOOD SENSE BUT IT IS THE GENIUS OF THE LANGUAGE
3895-6855-0034 I WAS ONE DAY PAYING MY FIRST VISIT TO THE WIFE OF PRESIDENT DE N WHEN HER NEPHEW A BRILLIANT BUTTERFLY CAME IN AND SHE INTRODUCED ME TO HIM MENTIONING MY NAME AND MY COUNTRY INDEED SIR YOU ARE ITALIAN SAID THE YOUNG MAN
3895-6855-0035 SIR WHEN I SAW YOU I WAS NEAR MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE I WOULD HAVE BETTED YOU WERE ITALIAN ANOTHER TIME I WAS DINING AT LADY LAMBERT'S IN NUMEROUS AND BRILLIANT COMPANY
3895-6855-0036 A YOUNG MARQUISE WHO HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING A GREAT WIT SAID TO ME IN THE MOST SERIOUS TONE IT IS TRULY AN ANTIQUE THE STONE MADAM UNDOUBTEDLY
3895-6855-0037 WHO DID NOT TAKE ANY NOTICE OF IT TOWARDS THE END OF THE DINNER SOMEONE SPOKE OF THE RHINOCEROS WHICH WAS THEN SHEWN FOR TWENTY FOUR SOUS AT THE SAINT GERMAIN'S FAIR LET US GO AND SEE IT WAS THE CRY
3895-6855-0038 I WAS THE ONLY GENTLEMAN I WAS TAKING CARE OF TWO LADIES IN THE MIDST OF THE CROWD AND THE WITTY MARQUISE WAS WALKING IN FRONT OF US
3895-6855-0039 THERE WAS A MAN PLACED TO RECEIVE THE MONEY OF THE VISITORS IT IS TRUE THAT THE MAN DRESSED IN THE AFRICAN FASHION WAS VERY DARK AND ENORMOUSLY STOUT YET HE HAD A HUMAN AND VERY MASCULINE FORM AND THE BEAUTIFUL MARQUISE HAD NO BUSINESS TO MAKE A MISTAKE
3895-6855-0040 NEVERTHELESS THE THOUGHTLESS YOUNG CREATURE WENT UP STRAIGHT TO HIM AND SAID ARE YOU THE RHINOCEROS SIR GO IN MADAM GO IN WE WERE DYING WITH LAUGHING
3895-6855-0041 AND THE MARQUISE WHEN SHE HAD SEEN THE ANIMAL THOUGHT HERSELF BOUND TO APOLOGIZE TO THE MASTER ASSURING HIM THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN A RHINOCEROS IN HER LIFE AND THEREFORE HE COULD NOT FEEL OFFENDED IF SHE HAD MADE A MISTAKE ONE EVENING I WAS IN THE FOYER OF THE ITALIAN COMEDY
3895-6855-0042 WHERE BETWEEN THE ACTS THE HIGHEST NOBLEMEN WERE IN THE HABIT OF COMING IN ORDER TO CONVERSE AND JOKE WITH THE ACTRESSES WHO USED TO SIT THERE WAITING FOR THEIR TURN TO APPEAR ON THE STAGE AND I WAS SEATED NEAR CAMILLE CORALINE'S SISTER WHOM I AMUSED BY MAKING LOVE TO HER
3895-6855-0043 ATTACKED ME UPON SOME REMARK I MADE RESPECTING AN ITALIAN PLAY AND TOOK THE LIBERTY OF SHEWING HIS BAD TEMPER BY CRITICIZING MY NATIVE COUNTRY I WAS ANSWERING HIM IN AN INDIRECT WAY LOOKING ALL THE TIME AT CAMILLE WHO WAS LAUGHING
3895-6855-0044 EVERYBODY HAD CONGREGATED AROUND US AND WAS ATTENTIVE TO THE DISCUSSION WHICH BEING CARRIED ON AS AN ASSAULT OF WIT HAD NOTHING TO MAKE IT UNPLEASANT BUT IT SEEMED TO TAKE A SERIOUS TURN WHEN THE YOUNG FOP TURNING THE CONVERSATION ON THE POLICE OF THE CITY
3895-6855-0045 DURING THE LAST MONTH HE ADDED THE PLACE DE GREVE HAS SEEN THE HANGING OF SEVEN MEN
3895-6855-0046 AN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY IN THAT I ANSWERED HONEST MEN GENERALLY CONTRIVE TO BE HUNG FAR AWAY FROM THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY AND AS A PROOF OF IT SIXTY FRENCHMEN HAVE BEEN HUNG IN THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR BETWEEN NAPLES ROME AND VENICE
3895-6855-0047 FIVE TIMES TWELVE ARE SIXTY SO YOU SEE THAT IT IS ONLY A FAIR EXCHANGE THE LAUGHTER WAS ALL ON MY SIDE AND THE FINE COUNCILLOR WENT AWAY RATHER CRESTFALLEN ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN PRESENT AT THE DISCUSSION FINDING MY ANSWER TO HIS TASTE
3895-6855-0048 CAME UP TO CAMILLE AND ASKED HER IN A WHISPER WHO I WAS WE GOT ACQUAINTED AT ONCE
3895-6855-0049 AND THE ACADEMY OF PAINTING WAS UNDER HIS JURISDICTION I MENTIONED MY BROTHER TO HIM AND HE GRACIOUSLY PROMISED TO PROTECT HIM ANOTHER YOUNG NOBLEMAN WHO CONVERSED WITH ME INVITED ME TO VISIT HIM IT WAS THE DUKE DE MATALONA
3895-6855-0050 I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD SEEN HIM THEN ONLY A CHILD EIGHT YEARS BEFORE IN NAPLES AND THAT I WAS UNDER GREAT OBLIGATIONS TO HIS UNCLE DON LELIO THE YOUNG DUKE WAS DELIGHTED AND WE BECAME INTIMATE FRIENDS
3895-6855-0051 HE BEGAN AT ONCE TO WORK WITH SUCCESS FOR PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS BUT HIS MAIN IDEA BEING TO COMPOSE A PICTURE TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE JUDGMENT OF THE ACADEMY
3895-6855-0052 HE IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK WITH GREAT DILIGENCE
3895-6855-0053 AND HE TENDERED A FRIENDLY WELCOME BOTH TO ME AND TO MY BROTHER IN WHOSE FAVOUR HE FELT INTERESTED AS A VENETIAN AND AS A YOUNG ARTIST SEEKING TO BUILD UP A POSITION BY HIS TALENT
3895-6855-0054 HE LIKED GAMBLING ALTHOUGH HE WAS ALWAYS UNLUCKY AT CARDS HE LOVED WOMEN AND HE WAS NOT MORE FORTUNATE WITH THEM BECAUSE HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO MANAGE THEM TWO YEARS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN PARIS HE FELL IN LOVE WITH MADAME DE COLANDE
3895-6855-0055 AND FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN HER AFFECTIONS HE KILLED HIMSELF
3895-6855-0056 WHEN I SEE WHAT THE SAME NATION IS DOING AGAINST THE KING THE PEOPLE WANT TO BE FREE IT IS A NOBLE AMBITION FOR MANKIND ARE NOT MADE TO BE THE SLAVES OF ONE MAN BUT WITH A NATION POPULOUS GREAT WITTY AND GIDDY WHAT WILL BE THE END OF THAT REVOLUTION
3895-6855-0057 TIME ALONE CAN TELL US THE DUKE DE MATALONA PROCURED ME THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE TWO PRINCES DON MARC ANTOINE AND DON JEAN BAPTISTE BORGHESE FROM ROME WHO WERE ENJOYING THEMSELVES IN PARIS YET LIVING WITHOUT DISPLAY
3895-6855-0058 IT WAS THE SAME WITH THE RUSSIAN PRINCES TO WHOM THE TITLE OF PRINCE WAS REFUSED WHEN THEY WANTED TO BE PRESENTED THEY WERE CALLED KNEES BUT THEY DID NOT MIND IT BECAUSE THAT WORD MEANT PRINCE THE COURT OF FRANCE HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOOLISHLY PARTICULAR ON THE QUESTION OF TITLES
3895-6855-0059 ALTHOUGH IT IS COMMON ENOUGH EVERYWHERE EVERY MAN WHO WAS NOT TITLED WAS CALLED SIEUR I HAVE REMARKED THAT THE KING NEVER ADDRESSED HIS BISHOPS OTHERWISE
3895-6855-0060 ALTHOUGH THEY WERE GENERALLY VERY PROUD OF THEIR TITLES THE KING LIKEWISE AFFECTED TO KNOW A NOBLEMAN ONLY WHEN HIS NAME WAS INSCRIBED AMONGST THOSE WHO SERVED HIM
3895-6855-0061 OF HAVING BEEN SEEN BY THE KING BUT THAT WAS ALL NEVERTHELESS
3895-6855-0062 EVEN WITH HIS MISTRESSES WHEN IN PUBLIC WHOEVER FAILED IN RESPECT TOWARDS THEM IN THE SLIGHTEST MANNER WAS SURE OF DISGRACE AND NO KING EVER POSSESSED TO A GREATER EXTENT THE GRAND ROYAL VIRTUE WHICH IS CALLED DISSIMULATION HE KEPT A SECRET FAITHFULLY
3895-6855-0063 AND HE WAS DELIGHTED WHEN HE KNEW THAT NO ONE BUT HIMSELF POSSESSED IT
3895-6855-0064 AND ALL THE LONG DISCUSSIONS WHICH THE FALSE CHEVALIER HAD WITH THE OFFICE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS WAS A COMEDY WHICH THE KING ALLOWED TO GO ON ONLY BECAUSE IT AMUSED HIM
3895-6855-0065 BUT HOW COULD HE POSSIBLY HAVE SUPPOSED HIMSELF FAULTY IN ANYTHING WHEN EVERYONE AROUND HIM REPEATED CONSTANTLY THAT HE WAS THE BEST OF KINGS A KING IN THE OPINION OF WHICH HE WAS IMBUED RESPECTING HIS OWN PERSON
3895-6855-0066 TO A GOD SAD DESTINY OF KINGS VILE FLATTERERS ARE CONSTANTLY DOING EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO REDUCE THEM BELOW THE CONDITION OF MAN
3895-6855-0067 THE KING CONSENTED AND PRESENTED HIS GOD SON WITH A REGIMENT BUT THE MOTHER WHO DID NOT LIKE THE MILITARY CAREER FOR HER SON REFUSED IT THE MARSHAL DE RICHELIEU TOLD ME THAT HE HAD NEVER KNOWN THE KING LAUGH SO HEARTILY AS WHEN HE HEARD OF THAT SINGULAR REFUSAL
3895-6855-0068 WHO WAS CALLED LOLOTTE SHE WAS THE MISTRESS OF LORD ALBEMARLE THE ENGLISH AMBASSADOR A WITTY AND VERY GENEROUS NOBLEMAN ONE EVENING HE COMPLAINED OF HIS MISTRESS PRAISING THE BEAUTY OF THE STARS WHICH WERE SHINING BRIGHTLY OVER HER HEAD
3895-6855-0069 SAYING THAT SHE OUGHT TO KNOW HE COULD NOT GIVE THEM TO HER IF LORD ALBEMARLE HAD BEEN AMBASSADOR TO THE COURT OF FRANCE AT THE TIME OF THE RUPTURE BETWEEN FRANCE AND ENGLAND HE WOULD HAVE ARRANGED ALL DIFFICULTIES AMICABLY
3895-6855-0070 THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE HARMONY BETWEEN TWO NATIONS DEPENDS VERY OFTEN UPON THEIR RESPECTIVE AMBASSADORS WHEN THERE IS ANY DANGER OF A RUPTURE AS TO THE NOBLE LORD'S MISTRESS THERE WAS BUT ONE OPINION RESPECTING HER
3895-6855-0071 SHE WAS FIT IN EVERY WAY TO BECOME HIS WIFE AND THE HIGHEST FAMILIES OF FRANCE DID NOT THINK THAT SHE NEEDED THE TITLE OF LADY ALBEMARLE TO BE RECEIVED WITH DISTINCTION NO LADY CONSIDERED IT DEBASING TO SIT NEAR HER ALTHOUGH SHE WAS WELL KNOWN AS THE MISTRESS OF THE ENGLISH LORD
3895-6855-0072 AND HER CONDUCT WAS ALWAYS OF THE HIGHEST RESPECTABILITY SHE BORE CHILDREN WHOM THE AMBASSADOR ACKNOWLEDGED LEGALLY
3895-6855-0073 I SHALL HAVE TO MENTION HER AGAIN IN MY MEMOIRS
3895-6855-0074 WITH A LADY FROM VENICE THE WIDOW OF AN ENGLISH BARONET NAMED WYNNE SHE WAS THEN COMING FROM LONDON WITH HER CHILDREN WHERE SHE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO GO IN ORDER TO INSURE THEM THE INHERITANCE OF THEIR LATE FATHER WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE LOST IF THEY HAD NOT DECLARED THEMSELVES MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
3895-6855-0075 SHE WAS ON HER WAY BACK TO VENICE MUCH PLEASED WITH HER JOURNEY SHE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HER ELDEST DAUGHTER A YOUNG GIRL OF TWELVE YEARS WHO NOTWITHSTANDING HER YOUTH CARRIED ON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE ALL THE SIGNS OF PERFECTION
3895-6855-0076 SHE IS NOW LIVING IN VENICE THE WIDOW OF COUNT DE ROSENBERG WHO DIED IN VENICE AMBASSADOR OF THE EMPRESS QUEEN MARIA THERESA SHE IS SURROUNDED BY THE BRILLIANT HALO OF HER EXCELLENT CONDUCT
3895-6855-0077 NO ONE CAN ACCUSE HER OF ANY FAULT EXCEPT THAT OF BEING POOR BUT SHE FEELS IT ONLY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ALLOW HER TO BE AS CHARITABLE AS SHE MIGHT WISH
