3245-169642-0000 THE DAUGHTER OF THE GREAT MOGUL
3245-169642-0001 IN THIS TIME I PURSUED MY VOYAGE COASTED THE WHOLE MALABAR SHORE AND MET WITH NO PURCHASE BUT A GREAT PORTUGAL EAST INDIA SHIP WHICH I CHASED INTO GOA WHERE SHE GOT OUT OF MY REACH
3245-169642-0002 I TOOK SEVERAL SMALL VESSELS AND BARKS BUT LITTLE OF VALUE IN THEM TILL I ENTERED THE GREAT BAY OF BENGAL WHEN I BEGAN TO LOOK ABOUT ME WITH MORE EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS
3245-169642-0003 THOUGH WITHOUT PROSPECT OF WHAT HAPPENED I CRUISED HERE ABOUT TWO MONTHS FINDING NOTHING WORTH WHILE SO I STOOD AWAY TO A PORT ON THE NORTH POINT OF THE ISLE OF SUMATRA WHERE I MADE NO STAY
3245-169642-0004 TO THE COUNTRY OF THE KING OF PEGU BEING TO CARRY THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF THE GREAT MOGUL TO PEGU WHO WAS TO BE MARRIED TO THE KING OF THAT COUNTRY
3245-169642-0005 JEWELS AND WEALTH THIS WAS A BOOTY WORTH WATCHING FOR THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SOME MONTHS LONGER SO I RESOLVED THAT WE WOULD GO AND CRUISE OFF POINT NEGARIS ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE BAY NEAR DIAMOND ISLE
3245-169642-0006 AND HERE WE PLIED OFF AND ON FOR THREE WEEKS AND BEGAN TO DESPAIR OF SUCCESS BUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE BOOTY WE EXPECTED SPURRED US ON AND WE WAITED WITH GREAT PATIENCE FOR WE KNEW THE PRIZE WOULD BE IMMENSELY RICH
3245-169642-0007 AT LENGTH WE SPIED THREE SHIPS COMING RIGHT UP TO US WITH THE WIND WE COULD EASILY SEE THEY WERE NOT EUROPEANS BY THEIR SAILS AND BEGAN TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR A PRIZE NOT FOR A FIGHT
3245-169642-0008 HOWEVER WE RESOLVED TO ATTACK HER IF SHE HAD BEEN FULL OF DEVILS AS SHE WAS FULL OF MEN ACCORDINGLY WHEN WE CAME NEAR THEM WE FIRED A GUN WITH SHOT AS A CHALLENGE
3245-169642-0009 AND SO TO COME THWART THEM IF WE COULD BUT FALLING FOR WANT OF WIND OPEN TO THEM WE GAVE THEM A FAIR BROADSIDE WE COULD EASILY SEE BY THE CONFUSION THAT WAS ON BOARD THAT THEY WERE FRIGHTENED OUT OF THEIR WITS
3245-169642-0010 THEY FIRED HERE A GUN AND THERE A GUN AND SOME ON THAT SIDE THAT WAS FROM US AS WELL AS THOSE THAT WERE NEXT TO US THE NEXT THING WE DID WAS TO LAY THEM ON BOARD WHICH WE DID PRESENTLY AND THEN GAVE THEM A VOLLEY OF OUR SMALL SHOT WHICH
3245-169642-0011 AS THEY STOOD SO THICK KILLED A GREAT MANY OF THEM AND MADE ALL THE REST RUN DOWN UNDER THEIR HATCHES CRYING OUT LIKE CREATURES BEWITCHED IN A WORD WE PRESENTLY TOOK THE SHIP AND HAVING SECURED HER MEN WE CHASED THE OTHER TWO
3245-169642-0012 ONE WAS CHIEFLY FILLED WITH WOMEN AND THE OTHER WITH LUMBER UPON THE WHOLE AS THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF THE GREAT MOGUL WAS OUR PRIZE IN THE FIRST SHIP SO IN THE SECOND WAS HER WOMEN OR IN A WORD HER HOUSEHOLD
3245-169642-0013 HER EUNUCHS ALL THE NECESSARIES OF HER WARDROBE OF HER STABLES AND OF HER KITCHEN AND IN THE LAST GREAT QUANTITIES OF HOUSEHOLD STUFF AND THINGS LESS COSTLY THOUGH NOT LESS USEFUL BUT THE FIRST WAS THE MAIN PRIZE
3245-169642-0014 AND ACCORDINGLY I JUMPED ON BOARD HE TOLD ME HE THOUGHT NOBODY BUT I OUGHT TO GO INTO THE GREAT CABIN OR AT LEAST NOBODY SHOULD GO THERE BEFORE ME FOR THAT THE LADY HERSELF AND ALL HER ATTENDANCE WAS THERE
3245-169642-0015 AND HE FEARED THE MEN WERE SO HEATED THEY WOULD MURDER THEM ALL OR DO WORSE I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO THE GREAT CABIN DOOR TAKING THE LIEUTENANT THAT CALLED ME ALONG WITH ME
3245-169642-0016 BUT SUCH A SIGHT OF GLORY AND MISERY WAS NEVER SEEN BY BUCCANEER BEFORE THE QUEEN FOR SUCH SHE WAS TO HAVE BEEN WAS ALL IN GOLD AND SILVER BUT FRIGHTENED AND CRYING
3245-169642-0017 AND AT THE SIGHT OF ME SHE APPEARED TREMBLING AND JUST AS IF SHE WAS GOING TO DIE SHE SAT ON THE SIDE OF A KIND OF A BED LIKE A COUCH WITH NO CANOPY OVER IT OR ANY COVERING ONLY MADE TO LIE DOWN UPON
3245-169642-0018 WHICH HE DID THE LADY WAS YOUNG AND I SUPPOSE IN THEIR COUNTRY ESTEEM VERY HANDSOME BUT SHE WAS NOT VERY MUCH SO IN MY THOUGHTS AT FIRST HER FRIGHT
3245-169642-0019 AND THE DANGER SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS IN OF BEING KILLED TAUGHT HER TO DO EVERYTHING THAT SHE THOUGHT MIGHT INTERPOSE BETWEEN HER AND DANGER AND THAT WAS TO TAKE OFF HER JEWELS AS FAST AS SHE COULD AND GIVE THEM TO ME AND I
3245-169642-0020 WITHOUT ANY GREAT COMPLIMENT TOOK THEM AS FAST AS SHE GAVE THEM ME AND PUT THEM INTO MY POCKET TAKING NO GREAT NOTICE OF THEM OR OF HER WHICH FRIGHTED HER WORSE THAN ALL THE REST AND SHE SAID SOMETHING WHICH I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
3245-169642-0021 HOWEVER TWO OF THE OTHER LADIES CAME ALL CRYING AND KNEELED DOWN TO ME WITH THEIR HANDS LIFTED UP WHAT THEY MEANT I KNEW NOT AT FIRST
3245-169642-0022 BUT BY THEIR GESTURES AND POINTINGS I FOUND AT LAST IT WAS TO BEG THE YOUNG QUEEN'S LIFE AND THAT I WOULD NOT KILL HER WHEN THE THREE LADIES KNEELED DOWN TO ME
3245-169642-0023 I LET THEM KNOW I WOULD NOT HURT THE QUEEN NOR LET ANY ONE ELSE HURT HER BUT THAT SHE MUST GIVE ME ALL HER JEWELS AND MONEY UPON THIS THEY ACQUAINTED HER THAT I WOULD SAVE HER LIFE AND NO SOONER HAD THEY ASSURED HER OF THAT
3245-169642-0024 BUT SHE GOT UP SMILING AND WENT TO A FINE INDIAN CABINET AND OPENED A PRIVATE DRAWER FROM WHENCE SHE TOOK ANOTHER LITTLE THING FULL OF LITTLE SQUARE DRAWERS AND HOLES
3245-169642-0025 THIS SHE BRINGS TO ME IN HER HAND AND OFFERED TO KNEEL DOWN TO GIVE IT ME THIS INNOCENT USAGE BEGAN TO ROUSE SOME GOOD NATURE IN ME THOUGH I NEVER HAD MUCH AND I WOULD NOT LET HER KNEEL
3245-169642-0026 BUT SITTING DOWN MYSELF ON THE SIDE OF HER COUCH OR BED MADE A MOTION TO HER TO SIT DOWN TOO BUT HERE SHE WAS FRIGHTENED AGAIN IT SEEMS
3245-169642-0027 BUT AS I DID NOT OFFER ANYTHING OF THAT KIND ONLY MADE HER SIT DOWN BY ME THEY BEGAN ALL TO BE EASIER AFTER SOME TIME AND SHE GAVE ME THE LITTLE BOX OR CASKET I KNOW NOT WHAT TO CALL IT BUT IT WAS FULL OF INVALUABLE JEWELS
3245-169642-0028 I HAVE THEM STILL IN MY KEEPING AND WISH THEY WERE SAFE IN ENGLAND FOR I DOUBT NOT BUT SOME OF THEM ARE FIT TO BE PLACED ON THE KING'S CROWN BEING MASTER OF THIS TREASURE I WAS VERY WILLING TO BE GOOD HUMORED TO THE PERSONS
3245-169642-0029 CAUSING THE GUARD TO BE KEPT STILL THAT THEY MIGHT RECEIVE NO MORE INJURY THAN I WOULD DO THEM MYSELF AFTER I HAD BEEN OUT OF THE CABIN SOME TIME A SLAVE OF THE WOMEN'S CAME TO ME AND MADE SIGN TO ME THAT THE QUEEN WOULD SPEAK WITH ME AGAIN
3245-169642-0030 I MADE SIGNS BACK THAT I WOULD COME AND DINE WITH HER MAJESTY AND ACCORDINGLY I ORDERED THAT HER SERVANTS SHOULD PREPARE HER DINNER AND CARRY IT IN AND THEN CALL ME THEY PROVIDED HER REPAST AFTER THE USUAL MANNER
3245-169642-0031 AND WHEN SHE SAW IT BROUGHT IN SHE APPEARED PLEASED AND MORE WHEN SHE SAW ME COME IN AFTER IT FOR SHE WAS EXCEEDINGLY PLEASED THAT I HAD CAUSED A GUARD TO KEEP THE REST OF MY MEN FROM HER
3245-169642-0032 IF SHE HAD UNDERSTOOD ENGLISH I COULD HAVE SAID PLAINLY AND IN GOOD ROUGH WORDS MADAM BE EASY WE ARE RUDE ROUGH HEWN FELLOWS BUT NONE OF OUR MEN SHOULD HURT YOU OR TOUCH YOU
3245-169642-0033 WE ARE FOR MONEY INDEED AND WE SHALL TAKE WHAT YOU HAVE BUT WE WILL DO YOU NO OTHER HARM BUT AS I COULD NOT TALK THUS TO HER I SCARCE KNEW WHAT TO SAY
3245-169642-0034 BUT I SAT DOWN AND MADE SIGNS TO HAVE HER SIT DOWN AND EAT WHICH SHE DID BUT WITH SO MUCH CEREMONY THAT I DID NOT KNOW WELL WHAT TO DO WITH IT
3245-169642-0035 AND DRINKING SOME WATER OUT OF A CHINA CUP SAT HER DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE COUCH AS BEFORE WHEN SHE SAW I HAD DONE EATING SHE WENT THEN TO ANOTHER CABINET AND PULLING OUT A DRAWER SHE BROUGHT IT TO ME
3245-169642-0036 FOR THAT THERE WAS NO SUBSISTING IN THAT MANNER UPON THIS WE CALLED A SHORT COUNCIL AND CONCLUDED TO CARRY THE GREAT SHIP AWAY WITH US BUT TO PUT ALL THE PRISONERS QUEEN LADIES AND ALL THE REST INTO THE LESSER VESSELS AND LET THEM GO
3245-169642-0037 AND SO FAR WAS I FROM RAVISHING THIS LADY AS I HEAR IS REPORTED OF ME THAT THOUGH I MIGHT RIFLE HER OF EVERYTHING ELSE YET I ASSURE YOU I LET HER GO UNTOUCHED FOR ME OR AS I AM SATISFIED FOR ANY ONE OF MY MEN
3245-169642-0038 BUT ALMOST TO HAVE MADE A NATION RICH AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH CONSIDERING THE COSTLY THINGS WE TOOK HERE WHICH WE DID NOT KNOW THE VALUE OF AND BESIDES GOLD AND SILVER AND JEWELS I SAY WE NEVER KNEW HOW RICH WE WERE
3245-169642-0039 WHICH BEING FOR SALE WERE PERHAPS AS A CARGO OF GOODS TO ANSWER THE BILLS WHICH MIGHT BE DRAWN UPON THEM FOR THE ACCOUNT OF THE BRIDE'S PORTION ALL WHICH FELL INTO OUR HANDS WITH A GREAT SUM IN SILVER COIN
3245-169642-0040 TOO BIG TO TALK OF AMONG ENGLISHMEN ESPECIALLY WHILE I AM LIVING
