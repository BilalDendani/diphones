1870-164330-0000 IT WAS NOT TILL SIX O'CLOCK THAT I LEFT THE CHATEAU TAKING WITH ME THE ARTICLE HASTILY WRITTEN BY MY FRIEND IN THE LITTLE SITTING ROOM
1870-164330-0001 THE REPORTER WAS TO SLEEP AT THE CHATEAU TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE TO ME INEXPLICABLE HOSPITALITY OFFERED HIM BY MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC TO WHOM MONSIEUR STANGERSON IN THAT SAD TIME LEFT THE CARE OF ALL HIS DOMESTIC AFFAIRS
1870-164330-0002 NEVERTHELESS HE INSISTED ON ACCOMPANYING ME TO THE STATION AT EPINAY IN CROSSING THE PARK HE SAID TO ME FREDERIC IS REALLY VERY CLEVER AND HAS NOT BELIED HIS REPUTATION
1870-164330-0003 DO YOU KNOW HOW HE CAME TO FIND DADDY JACQUES'S BOOTS NEAR THE SPOT WHERE WE NOTICED THE TRACES OF THE NEAT BOOTS AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE ROUGH ONES THERE WAS A SQUARE HOLE FRESHLY MADE IN THE MOIST GROUND
1870-164330-0004 WHERE A STONE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN REMOVED LARSAN SEARCHED FOR THAT STONE WITHOUT FINDING IT AND AT ONCE IMAGINED
1870-164330-0005 WITH WHICH TO SINK THE BOOTS IN THE LAKE
1870-164330-0006 THAT ESCAPED ME BUT MY MIND WAS TURNED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION BY THE LARGE NUMBER OF FALSE INDICATIONS OF HIS TRACK WHICH THE MURDERER LEFT AND BY THE MEASURE OF THE BLACK FOOT MARKS CORRESPONDING WITH THAT OF DADDY JACQUES'S BOOTS
1870-164330-0007 WHICH I HAD ESTABLISHED WITHOUT HIS SUSPECTING IT
1870-164330-0008 THAT THE MURDERER HAD SOUGHT TO TURN SUSPICION ON TO THE OLD SERVANT UP TO THAT POINT
1870-164330-0009 FOR I TELL YOU HE IS WORKING ON WRONG LINES AND I I MUST FIGHT HIM WITH NOTHING I WAS SURPRISED AT THE PROFOUNDLY GRAVE ACCENT WITH WHICH MY YOUNG FRIEND PRONOUNCED THE LAST WORDS HE REPEATED
1870-164330-0010 YES TERRIBLE TERRIBLE
1870-164330-0011 AT THAT MOMENT WE PASSED BY THE BACK OF THE CHATEAU NIGHT HAD COME A WINDOW ON THE FIRST FLOOR WAS PARTLY OPEN A FEEBLE LIGHT CAME FROM IT AS WELL AS SOME SOUNDS WHICH DREW OUR ATTENTION
1870-164330-0012 WE APPROACHED UNTIL WE HAD REACHED THE SIDE OF A DOOR THAT WAS SITUATED JUST UNDER THE WINDOW ROULETABILLE IN A LOW TONE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAS THE WINDOW OF MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S CHAMBER
1870-164330-0013 THE SOUNDS WHICH HAD ATTRACTED OUR ATTENTION CEASED THEN WERE RENEWED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN WE HEARD STIFLED SOBS WE WERE ONLY ABLE TO CATCH THESE WORDS WHICH REACHED US DISTINCTLY
1870-164330-0014 MY POOR ROBERT ROULETABILLE WHISPERED IN MY EAR
1870-164330-0015 MY INQUIRY WOULD SOON BE FINISHED HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM THE DARKNESS OF THE EVENING ENVELOPED US WE COULD NOT SEE MUCH BEYOND THE NARROW PATH BORDERED BY TREES WHICH RAN BEHIND THE CHATEAU
1870-164330-0016 THE SOBS HAD CEASED IF WE CAN'T HEAR WE MAY AT LEAST TRY TO SEE SAID ROULETABILLE AND MAKING A SIGN TO ME TO DEADEN THE SOUND OF MY STEPS
1870-164330-0017 HE LED ME ACROSS THE PATH TO THE TRUNK OF A TALL BEECH TREE THE WHITE BOLE OF WHICH WAS VISIBLE IN THE DARKNESS THIS TREE GREW EXACTLY IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW IN WHICH WE WERE SO MUCH INTERESTED ITS LOWER BRANCHES
1870-164330-0018 BEING ON A LEVEL WITH THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE CHATEAU FROM THE HEIGHT OF THOSE BRANCHES ONE MIGHT CERTAINLY SEE WHAT WAS PASSING IN MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S CHAMBER EVIDENTLY THAT WAS WHAT ROULETABILLE THOUGHT FOR ENJOINING ME TO REMAIN HIDDEN
1870-164330-0019 HE CLASPED THE TRUNK WITH HIS VIGOROUS ARMS AND CLIMBED UP I SOON LOST SIGHT OF HIM AMID THE BRANCHES AND THEN FOLLOWED A DEEP SILENCE IN FRONT OF ME THE OPEN WINDOW REMAINED LIGHTED
1870-164330-0020 AND I SAW NO SHADOW MOVE ACROSS IT I LISTENED AND PRESENTLY FROM ABOVE ME THESE WORDS REACHED MY EARS
1870-164330-0021 AFTER YOU PRAY SOMEBODY WAS OVERHEAD SPEAKING EXCHANGING COURTESIES WHAT WAS MY ASTONISHMENT TO SEE ON THE SLIPPERY COLUMN OF THE TREE TWO HUMAN FORMS APPEAR AND QUIETLY SLIP DOWN TO THE GROUND
1870-164330-0022 ROULETABILLE HAD MOUNTED ALONE AND HAD RETURNED WITH ANOTHER GOOD EVENING MONSIEUR SAINCLAIR IT WAS FREDERIC LARSAN THE DETECTIVE HAD ALREADY OCCUPIED THE POST OF OBSERVATION
1870-164330-0023 WHEN MY YOUNG FRIEND HAD THOUGHT TO REACH IT ALONE NEITHER NOTICED MY ASTONISHMENT I EXPLAINED THAT TO MYSELF BY THE FACT THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN WITNESSES OF SOME TENDER AND DESPAIRING SCENE BETWEEN MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON LYING IN HER BED
1870-164330-0024 AND MONSIEUR DARZAC ON HIS KNEES BY HER PILLOW I GUESSED THAT EACH HAD DRAWN DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS FROM WHAT THEY HAD SEEN IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT THE SCENE HAD STRONGLY IMPRESSED ROULETABILLE IN FAVOUR OF MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC
1870-164330-0025 WHILE TO LARSAN IT SHOWED NOTHING BUT CONSUMMATE HYPOCRISY ACTED WITH FINISHED ART BY MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S FIANCE AS WE REACHED THE PARK GATE LARSAN STOPPED US
1870-164330-0026 HE CRIED I LEFT IT NEAR THE TREE HE LEFT US SAYING HE WOULD REJOIN US PRESENTLY HAVE YOU NOTICED FREDERIC LARSAN'S CANE ASKED THE YOUNG REPORTER AS SOON AS WE WERE ALONE
1870-164330-0027 HE SEEMS TO TAKE GREAT CARE OF IT IT NEVER LEAVES HIM ONE WOULD THINK HE WAS AFRAID IT MIGHT FALL INTO THE HANDS OF STRANGERS I NEVER SAW IT BEFORE TO DAY WHERE DID HE FIND IT IT ISN'T NATURAL THAT A MAN WHO HAD NEVER BEFORE USED A WALKING STICK SHOULD
1870-164330-0028 THE DAY AFTER THE GLANDIER CRIME NEVER MOVE A STEP WITHOUT ONE
1870-164330-0029 AND PICKED UP HIS CANE FROM THE GROUND A PROCEEDING TO WHICH I WAS PERHAPS WRONG NOT TO ATTACH SOME IMPORTANCE WE WERE NOW OUT OF THE PARK ROULETABILLE HAD DROPPED INTO SILENCE
1870-164330-0030 HIS THOUGHTS WERE CERTAINLY STILL OCCUPIED WITH FREDERIC LARSAN'S NEW CANE I HAD PROOF OF THAT WHEN AS WE CAME NEAR TO EPINAY HE SAID
1870-164330-0031 HE BEGAN HIS INQUIRY BEFORE ME HE HAS HAD TIME TO FIND OUT THINGS ABOUT WHICH I KNOW NOTHING WHERE DID HE FIND THAT CANE THEN HE ADDED IT IS PROBABLE THAT HIS SUSPICION
1870-164330-0032 HAS LED HIM TO LAY HIS HAND ON SOMETHING TANGIBLE HAS THIS CANE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT WHERE THE DEUCE COULD HE HAVE FOUND IT AS I HAD TO WAIT TWENTY MINUTES FOR THE TRAIN AT EPINAY
1870-164330-0033 WE ENTERED A WINE SHOP ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE DOOR OPENED AND FREDERIC LARSAN MADE HIS APPEARANCE BRANDISHING HIS FAMOUS CANE
1870-164330-0034 HE SAID LAUGHINGLY THE THREE OF US SEATED OURSELVES AT A TABLE ROULETABILLE NEVER TOOK HIS EYES OFF THE CANE HE WAS SO ABSORBED THAT HE DID NOT NOTICE A SIGN LARSAN MADE TO A RAILWAY EMPLOYE
1870-164330-0035 A YOUNG MAN WITH A CHIN DECORATED BY A TINY BLOND AND ILL KEPT BEARD ON THE SIGN HE ROSE PAID FOR HIS DRINK BOWED AND WENT OUT I SHOULD NOT MYSELF HAVE ATTACHED ANY IMPORTANCE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE
1870-164330-0036 BY THE REAPPEARANCE OF THE MAN WITH THE BEARD AT ONE OF THE MOST TRAGIC MOMENTS OF THIS CASE I THEN LEARNED THAT THE YOUTH WAS ONE OF LARSAN'S ASSISTANTS AND HAD BEEN CHARGED BY HIM TO WATCH THE GOING AND COMING OF TRAVELLERS AT THE STATION OF EPINAY SUR ORGE
1870-164330-0037 I TURNED MY EYES AGAIN ON ROULETABILLE AH MONSIEUR FRED
1870-164330-0038 I HAVE ALWAYS SEEN YOU WALKING WITH YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS IT IS A PRESENT REPLIED THE DETECTIVE RECENT INSISTED ROULETABILLE NO IT WAS GIVEN TO ME IN LONDON
1870-164330-0039 MAY I LOOK AT IT OH
1870-164330-0040 FRED PASSED THE CANE TO ROULETABILLE IT WAS A LARGE YELLOW BAMBOO WITH A CRUTCH HANDLE AND ORNAMENTED WITH A GOLD RING
1870-164330-0041 RETURNED IT TO LARSAN WITH A BANTERING EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE SAYING
1870-164330-0042 POSSIBLY SAID FRED IMPERTURBABLY READ THE MARK THERE IN TINY LETTERS CASSETTE SIX A OPERA CANNOT ENGLISH PEOPLE BUY CANES IN PARIS
1870-164330-0043 WHEN ROULETABILLE HAD SEEN ME INTO THE TRAIN HE SAID YOU'LL REMEMBER THE ADDRESS YES CASSETTE SIX A OPERA RELY ON ME YOU SHALL HAVE WORD TOMORROW MORNING
1870-164330-0044 AND WROTE TO MY FRIEND A MAN UNMISTAKABLY ANSWERING TO THE DESCRIPTION OF MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC SAME HEIGHT SLIGHTLY STOOPING PUTTY COLOURED OVERCOAT BOWLER HAT PURCHASED A CANE SIMILAR TO THE ONE IN WHICH WE ARE INTERESTED
1870-164330-0045 ON THE EVENING OF THE CRIME ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK MONSIEUR CASSETTE HAD NOT SOLD ANOTHER SUCH CANE DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS FRED'S CANE IS NEW IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT IT'S THE SAME CANE FRED DID NOT BUY IT SINCE HE WAS IN LONDON
1870-164330-0046 LIKE YOU I THINK THAT HE FOUND IT SOMEWHERE NEAR MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC BUT IF AS YOU SUPPOSE THE MURDERER WAS IN THE YELLOW ROOM FOR FIVE OR EVEN SIX HOURS AND THE CRIME WAS NOT COMMITTED UNTIL TOWARDS MIDNIGHT
