404-132014-0000 JUST THEN ANOTHER VISITOR ENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM
404-132014-0001 HE WAS A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN OF MEDIUM HEIGHT WITH FIRM CLEARCUT FEATURES EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM FROM HIS WEARY BORED EXPRESSION TO HIS QUIET MEASURED STEP
404-132014-0002 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE NOT ONLY KNEW EVERYONE IN THE DRAWING ROOM BUT HAD FOUND THEM TO BE SO TIRESOME THAT IT WEARIED HIM TO LOOK AT OR LISTEN TO THEM AND AMONG ALL THESE FACES THAT HE FOUND SO TEDIOUS
404-132014-0003 NONE SEEMED TO BORE HIM SO MUCH AS THAT OF HIS PRETTY WIFE HE TURNED AWAY FROM HER WITH A GRIMACE THAT DISTORTED HIS HANDSOME FACE KISSED ANNA PAVLOVNA'S HAND AND SCREWING UP HIS EYES SCANNED THE WHOLE COMPANY
404-132014-0004 YOU ARE OFF TO THE WAR PRINCE SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA GENERAL KUTUZOV SAID BOLKONSKI SPEAKING FRENCH AND STRESSING THE LAST SYLLABLE OF THE GENERAL'S NAME LIKE A FRENCHMAN
404-132014-0005 SHE WILL GO TO THE COUNTRY ARE YOU NOT ASHAMED TO DEPRIVE US OF YOUR CHARMING WIFE ANDRE SAID HIS WIFE ADDRESSING HER HUSBAND IN THE SAME COQUETTISH MANNER IN WHICH SHE SPOKE TO OTHER MEN
404-132014-0006 THE VICOMTE HAS BEEN TELLING US SUCH A TALE ABOUT MADEMOISELLE GEORGE AND BUONAPARTE PRINCE ANDREW SCREWED UP HIS EYES AND TURNED AWAY PIERRE WHO FROM THE MOMENT PRINCE ANDREW ENTERED THE ROOM HAD WATCHED HIM WITH GLAD AFFECTIONATE EYES NOW CAME UP
404-132014-0007 AND TOOK HIS ARM BEFORE HE LOOKED ROUND PRINCE ANDREW FROWNED AGAIN EXPRESSING HIS ANNOYANCE WITH WHOEVER WAS TOUCHING HIS ARM BUT WHEN HE SAW PIERRE'S BEAMING FACE HE GAVE HIM AN UNEXPECTEDLY KIND AND PLEASANT SMILE
404-132014-0008 THERE NOW SO YOU TOO ARE IN THE GREAT WORLD
404-132014-0009 I KNEW YOU WOULD BE HERE REPLIED PIERRE I WILL COME TO SUPPER WITH YOU MAY I HE ADDED IN A LOW VOICE SO AS NOT TO DISTURB THE VICOMTE WHO WAS CONTINUING HIS STORY NO IMPOSSIBLE
404-132014-0010 SAID PRINCE ANDREW LAUGHING AND PRESSING PIERRE'S HAND TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO ASK THE QUESTION HE WISHED TO SAY SOMETHING MORE BUT AT THAT MOMENT PRINCE VASILI AND HIS DAUGHTER GOT UP TO GO AND THE TWO YOUNG MEN ROSE TO LET THEM PASS
404-132014-0011 SAID PRINCE VASILI TO THE FRENCHMAN HOLDING HIM DOWN BY THE SLEEVE IN A FRIENDLY WAY TO PREVENT HIS RISING THIS UNFORTUNATE FETE AT THE AMBASSADOR'S DEPRIVES ME OF A PLEASURE AND OBLIGES ME TO INTERRUPT YOU I AM VERY SORRY TO LEAVE YOUR ENCHANTING PARTY
404-132014-0012 HIS DAUGHTER PRINCESS HELENE PASSED BETWEEN THE CHAIRS LIGHTLY HOLDING UP THE FOLDS OF HER DRESS AND THE SMILE SHONE STILL MORE RADIANTLY ON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE PIERRE GAZED AT HER WITH RAPTUROUS ALMOST FRIGHTENED EYES AS SHE PASSED HIM
404-132014-0013 VERY LOVELY SAID PRINCE ANDREW VERY SAID PIERRE IN PASSING PRINCE VASILI SEIZED PIERRE'S HAND AND SAID TO ANNA PAVLOVNA EDUCATE THIS BEAR FOR ME
404-132014-0014 AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE SEEN HIM IN SOCIETY NOTHING IS SO NECESSARY FOR A YOUNG MAN AS THE SOCIETY OF CLEVER WOMEN ANNA PAVLOVNA SMILED AND PROMISED TO TAKE PIERRE IN HAND
404-132014-0015 SHE KNEW HIS FATHER TO BE A CONNECTION OF PRINCE VASILI'S THE ELDERLY LADY WHO HAD BEEN SITTING WITH THE OLD AUNT ROSE HURRIEDLY AND OVERTOOK PRINCE VASILI IN THE ANTEROOM ALL THE AFFECTATION OF INTEREST SHE HAD ASSUMED
404-132014-0016 HAD LEFT HER KINDLY AND TEAR WORN FACE AND IT NOW EXPRESSED ONLY ANXIETY AND FEAR HOW ABOUT MY SON BORIS PRINCE
404-132014-0017 I CAN'T REMAIN ANY LONGER IN PETERSBURG TELL ME WHAT NEWS I MAY TAKE BACK TO MY POOR BOY ALTHOUGH PRINCE VASILI LISTENED RELUCTANTLY AND NOT VERY POLITELY TO THE ELDERLY LADY EVEN BETRAYING SOME IMPATIENCE
404-132014-0018 SHE GAVE HIM AN INGRATIATING AND APPEALING SMILE AND TOOK HIS HAND THAT HE MIGHT NOT GO AWAY WHAT WOULD IT COST YOU TO SAY A WORD TO THE EMPEROR AND THEN HE WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE GUARDS AT ONCE
404-132014-0019 BELONGING TO ONE OF THE BEST FAMILIES IN RUSSIA BUT SHE WAS POOR AND HAVING LONG BEEN OUT OF SOCIETY HAD LOST HER FORMER INFLUENTIAL CONNECTIONS SHE HAD NOW COME TO PETERSBURG TO PROCURE AN APPOINTMENT IN THE GUARDS FOR HER ONLY SON
404-132014-0020 IT WAS IN FACT SOLELY TO MEET PRINCE VASILI THAT SHE HAD OBTAINED AN INVITATION TO ANNA PAVLOVNA'S RECEPTION AND HAD SAT LISTENING TO THE VICOMTE'S STORY
404-132014-0021 AN EMBITTERED LOOK CLOUDED HER ONCE HANDSOME FACE BUT ONLY FOR A MOMENT THEN SHE SMILED AGAIN AND CLUTCHED PRINCE VASILI'S ARM MORE TIGHTLY
404-132014-0022 NOR HAVE I EVER REMINDED YOU OF MY FATHER'S FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU BUT NOW I ENTREAT YOU FOR GOD'S SAKE TO DO THIS FOR MY SON AND I SHALL ALWAYS REGARD YOU AS A BENEFACTOR SHE ADDED HURRIEDLY NO DON'T BE ANGRY BUT PROMISE
404-132014-0023 I HAVE ASKED GOLITSYN AND HE HAS REFUSED BE THE KINDHEARTED MAN YOU ALWAYS WERE SHE SAID
404-132014-0024 PAPA WE SHALL BE LATE SAID PRINCESS HELENE TURNING HER BEAUTIFUL HEAD AND LOOKING OVER HER CLASSICALLY MOLDED SHOULDER AS SHE STOOD WAITING BY THE DOOR INFLUENCE IN SOCIETY HOWEVER IS A CAPITAL WHICH HAS TO BE ECONOMIZED IF IT IS TO LAST
404-132014-0025 HE WOULD SOON BE UNABLE TO ASK FOR HIMSELF
404-132014-0026 BUT IN PRINCESS DRUBETSKAYA'S CASE HE FELT AFTER HER SECOND APPEAL SOMETHING LIKE QUALMS OF CONSCIENCE SHE HAD REMINDED HIM OF WHAT WAS QUITE TRUE HE HAD BEEN INDEBTED TO HER FATHER FOR THE FIRST STEPS IN HIS CAREER
404-132014-0027 MOREOVER HE COULD SEE BY HER MANNERS THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN MOSTLY MOTHERS WHO HAVING ONCE MADE UP THEIR MINDS WILL NOT REST UNTIL THEY HAVE GAINED THEIR END AND ARE PREPARED IF NECESSARY TO GO ON INSISTING DAY AFTER DAY AND HOUR AFTER HOUR
404-132014-0028 AND EVEN TO MAKE SCENES THIS LAST CONSIDERATION MOVED HIM MY DEAR ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA
404-132014-0029 IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO WHAT YOU ASK BUT TO PROVE MY DEVOTION TO YOU AND HOW I RESPECT YOUR FATHER'S MEMORY I WILL DO THE IMPOSSIBLE YOUR SON SHALL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE GUARDS HERE IS MY HAND ON IT ARE YOU SATISFIED MY DEAR BENEFACTOR
404-132014-0030 THIS IS WHAT I EXPECTED FROM YOU I KNEW YOUR KINDNESS HE TURNED TO GO WAIT JUST A WORD WHEN HE HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE GUARDS SHE FALTERED
404-132014-0031 RECOMMEND BORIS TO HIM AS ADJUTANT THEN I SHALL BE AT REST AND THEN
404-132014-0032 MY DEAR BENEFACTOR PAPA SAID HIS BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER IN THE SAME TONE AS BEFORE WE SHALL BE LATE WELL AU REVOIR GOOD BYE YOU HEAR HER THEN TOMORROW YOU WILL SPEAK TO THE EMPEROR
404-132014-0033 CERTAINLY BUT ABOUT KUTUZOV I DON'T PROMISE DO PROMISE DO PROMISE VASILI CRIED ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA AS HE WENT WITH THE SMILE OF A COQUETTISH GIRL WHICH AT ONE TIME PROBABLY CAME NATURALLY TO HER BUT WAS NOW VERY ILL SUITED TO HER CAREWORN FACE
404-132014-0034 APPARENTLY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HER AGE AND BY FORCE OF HABIT EMPLOYED ALL THE OLD FEMININE ARTS BUT AS SOON AS THE PRINCE HAD GONE HER FACE RESUMED ITS FORMER COLD ARTIFICIAL EXPRESSION
