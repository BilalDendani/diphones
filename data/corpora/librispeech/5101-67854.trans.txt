5101-67854-0000 WHEN I GROW UP ASKED SYLVIA MISSUS FULTON SMILED SYLVIA GROWN UP SEEMED A LONG WAY IN THE FUTURE
5101-67854-0001 YOU COULD BEGIN TO MORROW IF YOU WISHED
5101-67854-0002 WHY THAT WILL BE BETTER THAN GOING TO SCHOOL BUT WE MUST NOT LET YOUR OWN STUDIES BE NEGLECTED HER MOTHER REMINDED HER SO AFTER YOU HAVE GIVEN ESTRALLA A MORNING LESSON EACH DAY
5101-67854-0003 YOU AND I WILL STUDY TOGETHER AND KEEP UP WITH GRACE AND FLORA BY THE WAY
5101-67854-0004 SHE WAS VERY SORRY NOT TO SEE YOU AND I HAVE ASKED FLORA AND GRACE TO COME TO SUPPER TO MORROW NIGHT SYLVIA BEGAN TO THINK THAT A WORLD WITHOUT SCHOOL WAS GOING TO BE A VERY PLEASANT WORLD AFTER ALL
5101-67854-0005 SHE WAS SURE THAT IT WOULD BE GREAT FUN TO TEACH ESTRALLA AND TO HAVE LESSONS WITH HER MOTHER WAS EVEN BETTER THAN RECITING TO PRETTY MISS ROSALIE
5101-67854-0006 SO SHE HAD MANY PLEASANT THINGS TO THINK OF WHICH WAS EXACTLY WHAT HER MOTHER HAD PLANNED HER FATHER HAD SAID THAT SHE MIGHT ASK GRACE TO GO SAILING WITH THEM IN THE BUTTERFLY IN A DAY OR TWO
5101-67854-0007 AND NOW SYLVIA RESOLVED TO ASK IF SHE MIGHT NOT ASK FLORA AS WELL AND PERHAPS ESTRALLA COULD GO TOO SO IT WAS NO WONDER THAT SHE RAN UP STAIRS SINGING THERE'S A GOOD TIME COMING IT'S ALMOST HERE
5101-67854-0008 GREATLY TO THE SATISFACTION OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER WHO HAD FEARED THAT SHE WOULD BE VERY UNHAPPY OVER THE SCHOOL AFFAIR THEY WERE SORRY IT HAD HAPPENED BUT THEY COULD NOT BLAME SYLVIA OH MISSY SYLVIA
5101-67854-0009 ESTRALLA STOOD SMILING BEFORE HER OH EXCLAIMED SYLVIA WITH SUCH SURPRISE THAT THE LITTLE DARKY LOOKED AT HER WONDERINGLY YO TELLS ME TO COME AN HERE I IS SHE REPEATED YOU TELLS ME
5101-67854-0010 FOR A MOMENT SYLVIA WAS TEMPTED TO TELL ESTRALLA THAT IT COULDN'T BE HELPED AS LONG AS SOUTH CAROLINA BELIEVED IN SLAVERY BUT ESTRALLA'S SAD EYES AND PLEADING LOOK MADE HER RESOLVE AGAIN TO PROTECT THIS LITTLE SLAVE GIRL AGAINST INJUSTICE
5101-67854-0011 SO SHE REPLIED QUICKLY THAT IS MY SECRET BUT DON'T YOU WORRY SOME DAY VERY SOON I SHALL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT YOU KNOW ESTRALLA THAT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID
5101-67854-0012 SHE WAS ALWAYS QUITE READY TO SMILE BUT SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY SYLVIA HAD WANTED HER TO COME SO MYSTERIOUSLY TO HER ROOM AND I AM GOING TO TEACH YOU TO READ AND WRITE SYLVIA ADDED IS YOU MISSY
5101-67854-0013 ESTRALLA RESPONDED IN A HALF FRIGHTENED WHISPER
5101-67854-0014 FOR VERY FEW SLAVE OWNERS ALLOWED ANYONE TO TEACH THE SLAVES TO READ AND WRITE ESTRALLA KNEW THIS AND IT SEEMED A WONDERFUL THING THAT MISSY SYLVIA PROPOSED I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT TO MORROW MORNING SAID SYLVIA NOW RUN AWAY
5101-67854-0015 AND WITH A CHUCKLE OF DELIGHT ESTRALLA CLOSED THE DOOR SOFTLY BEHIND HER SHE HAD BEEN QUITE READY TO RUN AWAY WITH MISSY SYLVIA WHEN SHE HAD CREPT UP THE STAIRS EARLIER IN THE EVENING BUT TO STAY SAFELY WITH HER MAMMY
5101-67854-0016 AND LEARN TO READ SEEMED A MUCH HAPPIER PLAN TO THE LITTLE DARKY IF SHE COULD READ AND WRITE WHY
5101-67854-0017 NOW SYLVIA REALIZED AS SHE STOOD ALONE IN HER SAFE PLEASANT CHAMBER THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SHE MUST DELIVER THE LETTER ENTRUSTED TO HER IF IT WAS TO GO TO WASHINGTON IT MUST BE SOME MESSAGE THAT WAS OF IMPORTANCE TO THE OFFICERS AT FORT MOULTRIE AND FORT SUMTER SHE THOUGHT
5101-67854-0018 PERHAPS IT MIGHT EVEN BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP CAROLINIANS TO GIVE UP SLAVERY AND THEN ESTRALLA AND AUNT CONNIE AND ALL THE BLACK PEOPLE SHE KNEW AND LIKED COULD BE SAFE AND HAVE HOMES OF THEIR OWN SYLVIA WENT TO THE WINDOW AND PEERED OUT
5101-67854-0019 THE STREET AND GARDEN LAY DARK AND SHADOWY NOW AND THEN A DARK FIGURE WENT ALONG THE STREET THE HOUSE SEEMED VERY QUIET SHE TIPTOED TO THE CLOSET AND TOOK OUT A BROWN CAPE
5101-67854-0020 THEN FROM ONE OF THE BUREAU DRAWERS SHE DREW OUT A LONG BLUE SILK SCARF AND TWISTED IT ABOUT HER HEAD I CAN PULL THE END OVER MY FACE AND THEY'LL THINK I'M A DARKY SHE THOUGHT RESOLVED IF ANYONE SPOKE TO HER NOT TO ANSWER
5101-67854-0021 SHE WHISPERED OVER THE NAME AND ADDRESS ON THE LETTER SHE KNEW THAT THE STREET LED FROM KING STREET AND SHE WAS SURE THAT SHE COULD FIND IT BUT IT WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM HOME IT WOULD BE LATE BEFORE SHE COULD GET BACK SHE BLEW OUT HER CANDLE
5101-67854-0022 SHE COULD NOT HEAR A SOUND AND TIPTOED CAUTIOUSLY ALONG THE HALL TO THE STAIRS WHAT IF THE DOOR OF HER MOTHER'S ROOM SHOULD OPEN SHE THOUGHT TERRIFIED AT SUCH A POSSIBILITY WHAT COULD SHE SAY SHE HAD PROMISED NOT TO TELL OF THE LETTER
5101-67854-0023 AND WHAT REASON COULD SHE GIVE FOR CREEPING OUT OF THE HOUSE AT THAT HOUR BUT SHE REACHED THE LOWER FLOOR SAFELY AND NOW CAME THE DANGER OF MAKING A NOISE WHEN OPENING THE DOOR SYLVIA GRASPED THE BIG KEY AND TURNED IT SLOWLY
5101-67854-0024 THEN SHE PULLED AT THE HEAVY DOOR AND IT SWUNG BACK EASILY
5101-67854-0025 SHE LEFT THE DOOR AJAR SO THAT SHE COULD SLIP IN EASILY ON HER RETURN KEEPING IN THE SHADOW OF THE TREES SHE REACHED THE STREET AND NOW SHE FELT SURE THAT NOTHING COULD PREVENT HER FROM DELIVERING THE LETTER SHE RAN SWIFTLY ALONG
5101-67854-0026 NOW AND THEN MEETING SOMEONE WHO GLANCED WONDERINGLY AT THE FLYING LITTLE FIGURE SHE HAD REACHED KING STREET AND WAS NEARLY AT THE STREET WHERE SHE WAS TO TURN WHEN SUDDENLY A HEAVY HAND GRASPED HER ARM AND NEARLY SWUNG HER FROM HER FEET
5101-67854-0027 RUNNING OFF ARE YOU AND WEARING YOUR MISTRESS'S CLOTHES AT THAT I'LL WARRANT SAID A GRUFF VOICE
5101-67854-0028 SYLVIA PULLED THE SILKEN SCARF FROM HER FACE AND EVEN IN THE GLIMMER OF THE DULL STREET LAMP UNDER WHICH THE MAN HAD DRAWN HER HE COULD SEE THE AUBURN HAIR AND BLUE EYES BUT HE STILL KEPT HIS GRASP ON HER ARM
5101-67854-0029 THE MAN RELEASED HIS GRASP INSTANTLY NO DARKY GIRL OR SLAVE WOULD HAVE SPOKEN LIKE THAT HE VANISHED AS SUDDENLY AS HE HAD APPEARED MORE FRIGHTENED NOW THAN SYLVIA HERSELF FOR AN INSTANT SYLVIA STOOD QUITE STILL
5101-67854-0030 SHE FELT READY TO CRY AND NOW WALKED MORE SLOWLY FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE REALIZED SOMETHING OF WHAT IT MUST BE TO BE A COLORED GIRL IF I HAD BEEN ESTRALLA
5101-67854-0031 OH I MUST GET MISTER ROBERT WAITE TO LET ESTRALLA STAY SAFE WITH US SHE WAS NOW NEAR HER DESTINATION WHICH PROVED TO BE A LARGE HOUSE RIGHT ON THE STREET SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE IT WAS OPENED
5101-67854-0032 THEN SHE FOUND HERSELF LOOKING UP AT A TALL MAN WHOSE WHITE HAIR AND KINDLY SMILE GAVE HER CONFIDENCE WELL LITTLE GIRL WHOM DO YOU WISH TO SEE HE ASKED PLEASANTLY I HAVE A MESSAGE
5101-67854-0033 DOANE YES COME IN
5101-67854-0034 SYLVIA DREW THE LETTER FROM ITS HIDING PLACE AND HANDED IT TO HIM AND MISTER DOANE SLIPPED IT INTO HIS POCKET COME IN MY CHILD AND REST A MOMENT YOU ARE OUT OF BREATH HE SAID LEADING THE WAY TO A SMALL ROOM AT THE END OF THE NARROW HALL
5101-67854-0035 SYLVIA WAS GLAD TO SIT DOWN IN A LOW CHAIR NEAR THE TABLE WHILE MISTER DOANE OPENED THE ENVELOPE SHE COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER LETTER ENCLOSED AS WELL AS THE ONE WHICH THE TALL MAN WAS READING WITH SUCH INTEREST WHEN HE HAD FINISHED READING THE LETTER
5101-67854-0036 HE TORE IT INTO A GREAT MANY SMALL PIECES THEN HE PUT THE ENCLOSED ENVELOPE CAREFULLY IN AN INNER POCKET SO YOU BROUGHT ME THIS LETTER FROM THE FORT WELL YOU HAVE DONE WHAT I HOPE MAY PROVE A GREAT SERVICE TO THE STARS AND STRIPES
5101-67854-0037 I THANK YOU HE SAID LOOKING WITH SMILING EYES AT THE TIRED LITTLE FIGURE IN THE BROWN CAPE THEN HE ASKED SYLVIA HER NAME AND SHE TOLD HIM THAT NO ONE NOT EVEN HER DEAR MOTHER KNEW THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT THE MESSAGE
5101-67854-0038 BEFORE THEY HAD FINISHED THEIR TALK HE HAD HEARD ALL ABOUT THE BLUE COCKADES THAT THE GIRLS HAD WORN AT MISS PATTEN'S SCHOOL AND OF SYLVIA'S REFUSAL TO SALUTE THE PALMETTO FLAG YOU SEE I COULDN'T DO THAT
5101-67854-0039 BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN THAT I BELIEVED THAT ESTRALLA OUGHT TO BE A SLAVE
5101-67854-0040 AND WHEN HE TOLD HER AGAIN THAT BY HER COURAGE IN BRINGING HIM THE MESSAGE FROM THE FORT AND BY HER SILENCE IN REGARD TO IT THAT SHE HAD DONE HIM A GREAT SERVICE
5101-67854-0041 WAS THAT THE STATE SHOULD FREE HERSELF FROM SLAVERY
