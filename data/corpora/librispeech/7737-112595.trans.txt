7737-112595-0000 CHAPTER NINE HOW THE IRISH SCHOLARS COMPILED THEIR ANNALS AMONG THE VARIOUS CLASSES OF PERSONS WHO DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO LITERATURE IN ANCIENT IRELAND THERE WERE SPECIAL ANNALISTS WHO MADE IT THEIR BUSINESS TO RECORD
7737-112595-0001 WITH THE UTMOST ACCURACY ALL REMARKABLE EVENTS SIMPLY AND BRIEFLY YEAR BY YEAR THE EXTREME CARE THEY TOOK THAT THEIR STATEMENTS SHOULD BE TRUTHFUL IS SHOWN BY THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY COMPILED THEIR BOOKS
7737-112595-0002 AS A GENERAL RULE THEY ADMITTED NOTHING INTO THEIR RECORDS EXCEPT EITHER WHAT OCCURRED DURING THEIR LIFETIME AND WHICH MAY BE SAID TO HAVE COME UNDER THEIR OWN PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OR WHAT THEY FOUND RECORDED IN THE COMPILATIONS OF PREVIOUS ANNALISTS
7737-112595-0003 WHO HAD THEMSELVES FOLLOWED THE SAME PLAN THESE MEN TOOK NOTHING ON HEARSAY AND IN THIS MANNER SUCCESSIVE ANNALISTS CARRIED ON A CONTINUED CHRONICLE FROM AGE TO AGE WE HAVE STILL PRESERVED TO US MANY BOOKS OF NATIVE ANNALS
7737-112595-0004 THEY DEAL WITH THE AFFAIRS OF IRELAND GENERALLY BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY MANY OF THEM RECORD EVENTS OCCURRING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND IT WAS A COMMON PRACTICE TO BEGIN THE WORK WITH A BRIEF GENERAL HISTORY
7737-112595-0005 THERE ARE MANY TESTS WHICH PROVE THE REMARKABLE ACCURACY OF THE IRISH ANNALS FOR INSTANCE THEIR RECORDS OF SUCH OCCURRENCES AS ECLIPSES COMETS TIDES AND SO FORTH ARE INVARIABLY FOUND TO BE CORRECT
7737-112595-0006 INDEED THEY COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE FOR THE GOOD REASON THAT THE FAITHFUL CHRONICLER NOTED DOWN THE EVENTS EACH AT THE VERY TIME OF ITS OCCURRENCE IF HE WAITED FOR SOME FUTURE TIME
7737-112595-0007 OR NOTED DOWN SOME EVENT THAT HAD OCCURRED YEARS BEFORE TAKING HEARSAY EVIDENCE OR CALCULATING THE TIME BACKWARDS AS BEST HE COULD THE CHANCES WERE THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ERROR IN THE DATE
7737-112595-0008 AT THE PRESENT DAY ASTRONOMERS CAN CALCULATE TO A MINUTE THE TIME OF AN ECLIPSE OCCURRING IN THAT OR ANY OTHER YEAR BUT IT WAS OTHERWISE TWELVE CENTURIES AGO
7737-112595-0009 THEN THE RULES OF CALCULATION WERE NOT QUITE CORRECT SO THAT A PERSON CALCULATING BACKWARDS WAS PRETTY SURE TO BE IN ERROR AS TO THE EXACT TIME THE GREAT ENGLISH HISTORIAN AND SCHOLAR THE VENERABLE BEDE
7737-112595-0010 WAS AWARE OF THE YEAR SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR BUT HAD TO CALCULATE THE DAY AND THE HOUR THE RULE THEN IN VOGUE LED HIM ASTRAY AND ACCORDINGLY HIS RECORD OF THE DATE THE THIRD MAY IS TWO DAYS WRONG
7737-112595-0011 FIRST MAY SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FOURTH IS GIVEN AND EVEN THE VERY HOUR THIS SHOWS QUITE CLEARLY THAT THE EVENT HAD BEEN RECORDED BY SOME IRISH CHRONICLER WHO ACTUALLY SAW IT AND NOTED IT DOWN ON THE SPOT
7737-112595-0012 WE FIND NUMBERS OF RECORDS OF THIS KIND IN OUR ANNALS WHICH ACCORDING TO THE ACCURATE TESTS WE ARE NOW ABLE TO APPLY ARE ALL FOUND TO BE CORRECT ANOTHER REMARKABLE INSTANCE OF A SIMILAR KIND DESERVES TO BE MENTIONED HERE
7737-112595-0013 WE HAVE AN OLD IRISH BOOK CALLED THE WAR OF THE IRISH WITH THE DANES WRITTEN EARLY IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY SOON AFTER THE BATTLE OF CLONTARF IN WHICH THAT GREAT BATTLE IS VERY FULLY DESCRIBED IN THE COURSE OF HIS NARRATIVE
7737-112595-0014 THE WRITER MAKES THESE VERY SPECIFIC STATEMENTS THAT THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT ON GOOD FRIDAY THE TWENTY THIRD APRIL
7737-112595-0015 THAT IT COMMENCED AT SUNRISE WHEN THE TIDE WAS FULL IN AND THAT IT LASTED THE WHOLE DAY TILL THE TIDE WAS AGAIN AT FLOOD ABOUT THE SAME HOUR IN THE EVENING WHEN THE FOREIGNERS WERE ROUTED MOREOVER THE OLD HISTORIAN PUTS IN THE TIME OF HIGH WATER MORNING AND AFTERNOON
7737-112595-0016 FOR ON ACCOUNT OF THE FULL TIDE THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO REACH THEIR SHIPS WHICH LAY SOME DISTANCE OUT IN THE BAY WHEREAS IF IT HAD BEEN LOW WATER THEY MIGHT HAVE WADED OUT TO THEM BEYOND THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST CONCERNED ABOUT THE TIME OF HIGH TIDE
7737-112595-0017 THE TIDE COMES IN AT ANY PARTICULAR POINT OF THE COAST ABOUT EVERY TWELVE HOURS TWENTY FIVE MINUTES AND ACCORDINGLY THE HOUR CHANGES FROM DAY TO DAY SO THAT THERE MIGHT BE A HIGH TIDE AT ANY HOUR OF THE TWENTY FOUR BUT ASTRONOMERS CAN NOW CALCULATE
7737-112595-0018 THE EXACT TIME OF HIGH TIDE FOR ANY DAY OF THE MONTH AT A PARTICULAR PLACE IN ANY YEAR NO MATTER HOW FAR BACK NOW THE QUESTION IS WAS THE TIDE REALLY AT ITS HEIGHT ON THE CLONTARF SHORE AT SUNRISE
7737-112595-0019 ON THAT FATAL MORNING FORTY YEARS AGO
7737-112595-0020 IN ORDER TO TEST THE CHRONICLER'S ACCURACY
7737-112595-0021 AFTER A LABORIOUS CALCULATION DOCTOR HAUGHTON FOUND THAT THE TIDE WAS AT ITS HEIGHT THAT MORNING AT HALF PAST FIVE O'CLOCK JUST AS THE SUN WAS COMING OVER THE HORIZON AND THAT THE EVENING TIDE WAS IN AT FIFTY FIVE MINUTES PAST FIVE
7737-112595-0022 A STRIKING CONFIRMATION OF THE TRUTH OF THIS PART OF THE NARRATIVE IT SHOWS TOO THAT THE ACCOUNT WAS WRITTEN BY OR TAKEN DOWN FROM AN EYE WITNESS OF THE BATTLE DOCTOR HAUGHTON'S CALCULATION EVERY FIGURE
7737-112595-0023 MAY NOW BE SEEN IN DOCTOR TODD'S PUBLISHED BOOK LITTLE DID THE OLD ANNALIST THINK WHEN PENNING HIS SIMPLE RECORD THAT AFTER LYING BY UNNOTICED AND FORGOTTEN ON SOME OBSCURE BOOKSHELF FOR EIGHT CENTURIES
7737-112595-0024 IT WAS DESTINED TO BE AT LAST BROUGHT OUT UNDER THE BROAD LIGHT OF SCIENCE AND ITS ACCURACY FULLY TESTED AND ESTABLISHED THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER WAYS OF TESTING THE TRUTH OF OUR ANNALS
7737-112595-0025 ONE IS BY COMPARING THEM WITH THE TESTIMONY OF FOREIGN WRITERS OF GOOD STANDING EVENTS OCCURRING IN IRELAND IN THOSE EARLY AGES ARE NOT OFTEN MENTIONED BY BRITISH OR CONTINENTAL WRITERS INDEED THEY KNEW VERY LITTLE ABOUT IRELAND
7737-112595-0026 WHICH WAS IN THOSE TIMES ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS THE CONTINENT A VERY REMOTE PLACE BUT WHENEVER THEY DO NOTICE IRISH AFFAIRS IT MAY BE SAID THAT THEY ARE ALWAYS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE NATIVE RECORDS
7737-112595-0027 IN OUR IRISH BOOKS WE FIND ACCOUNTS OF EVENTS OR CUSTOMS WHICH SOME PEOPLE NOT KNOWING BETTER WOULD BE INCLINED TO PRONOUNCE FABULOUS BUT WHICH WE FIND RECORDED AS SOBER HISTORY BY CERTAIN GREAT ENGLISH AND CONTINENTAL HISTORIANS
7737-112595-0028 THE COLONISATION OF SCOTLAND FROM IRELAND FOR INSTANCE WHICH WAS FORMERLY DOUBTED BY MANY IS FULLY CONFIRMED BY THE VENERABLE BEDE
7737-112595-0029 ALL THE IRISH CHRONICLES STATE THAT A GENERAL ROUT OF THE DANES TOOK PLACE IN THE EVENING AND THAT THERE WAS AN AWFUL SLAUGHTER OF THEM FOR THEY WERE CUT OFF FROM THEIR FORTRESS BY THE RIVER LIFFEY AND FROM THEIR SHIPS BY THE HIGH TIDE WHILE THE INFURIATED IRISH ASSAILED THEM FRONT FLANK AND REAR
7737-112595-0030 THE BEST POSSIBLE AUTHORITY IN THE CASE AS HE HAD GOOD REASON TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THERE IS A FULL CONFIRMATION OF THIS HIS RECORD IS SIMPLE AND PLAIN THEN FLIGHT BROKE OUT THROUGHOUT ALL THE DANISH HOST
7737-112595-0031 THE MORE THEIR TRUTHFULNESS IS MADE MANIFEST THEIR UNIFORM AGREEMENT AMONG THEMSELVES AND THEIR ACCURACY AS TRIED BY VARIOUS TESTS HAVE DRAWN FORTH THE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OF THE GREATEST IRISH SCHOLARS AND ARCHAEOLOGISTS THAT EVER LIVED
7737-112595-0032 THE EXISTING BOOKS OF IRISH ANNALS WILL BE FOUND DESCRIBED IN OUR HISTORIES OF IRELAND AND MORE FULLY IN THE TWO SOCIAL HISTORIES OF ANCIENT IRELAND
7737-112595-0033 HERE WE MUST CONTENT OURSELVES WITH MENTIONING ONE THE ANNALS OF THE FOUR MASTERS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL THESE WERE COMPILED IN THE FRANCISCAN MONASTERY OF DONEGAL BY THREE OF THE O'CLERYS
7737-112595-0034 AND BY FERFESA O'MULCONRY WHO ARE NOW COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE FOUR MASTERS THEY BEGAN IN SIXTEEN THIRTY TWO AND COMPLETED THE WORK IN SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX
7737-112595-0035 THE ANNALS OF THE FOUR MASTERS WAS TRANSLATED WITH MOST ELABORATE AND LEARNED ANNOTATIONS BY DOCTOR JOHN O'DONOVAN AND IT WAS PUBLISHED IRISH TEXT TRANSLATION AND NOTES IN SEVEN LARGE VOLUMES
