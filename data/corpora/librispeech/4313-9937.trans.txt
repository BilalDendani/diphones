4313-9937-0000 WITHOUT DISTINCTION PROVIDED THEY LEFT HIM IN PEACE AS THE GREEKS CALLED THE FURIES THE BEAUTIFUL THE GOOD THE CHARMING
4313-9937-0001 LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD
4313-9937-0002 WITHOUT WHICH NO ONE COULD EXIST AT THAT TIME BUT HE WAS NEITHER A ROYALIST A BONAPARTIST A CHARTIST AN ORLEANIST NOR AN ANARCHIST HE WAS A BOUQUINIST A COLLECTOR OF OLD BOOKS
4313-9937-0003 HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW MEN COULD BUSY THEMSELVES WITH HATING EACH OTHER BECAUSE OF SILLY STUFF LIKE THE CHARTER DEMOCRACY LEGITIMACY MONARCHY THE REPUBLIC ET CETERA WHEN THERE WERE IN THE WORLD
4313-9937-0004 ALL SORTS OF MOSSES GRASSES AND SHRUBS WHICH THEY MIGHT BE LOOKING AT AND HEAPS OF FOLIOS
4313-9937-0005 HE TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO BECOME USELESS HAVING BOOKS DID NOT PREVENT HIS READING BEING A BOTANIST DID NOT PREVENT HIS BEING A GARDENER WHEN HE MADE PONTMERCY'S ACQUAINTANCE
4313-9937-0006 THIS SYMPATHY HAD EXISTED BETWEEN THE COLONEL AND HIMSELF THAT WHAT THE COLONEL DID FOR FLOWERS HE DID FOR FRUITS
4313-9937-0007 IT IS FROM ONE OF HIS COMBINATIONS APPARENTLY THAT THE OCTOBER MIRABELLE NOW CELEBRATED AND NO LESS PERFUMED THAN THE SUMMER MIRABELLE OWES ITS ORIGIN HE WENT TO MASS RATHER FROM GENTLENESS THAN FROM PIETY
4313-9937-0008 AND BECAUSE AS HE LOVED THE FACES OF MEN BUT HATED THEIR NOISE HE FOUND THEM ASSEMBLED AND SILENT ONLY IN CHURCH FEELING THAT HE MUST BE SOMETHING IN THE STATE HE HAD CHOSEN THE CAREER OF WARDEN
4313-9937-0009 HOWEVER HE HAD NEVER SUCCEEDED IN LOVING ANY WOMAN AS MUCH AS A TULIP BULB
4313-9937-0010 HE HAD LONG PASSED SIXTY WHEN ONE DAY SOME ONE ASKED HIM HAVE YOU NEVER BEEN MARRIED I HAVE FORGOTTEN SAID HE WHEN IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED TO HIM AND TO WHOM DOES IT NOT HAPPEN TO SAY OH
4313-9937-0011 IF I WERE ONLY RICH IT WAS NOT WHEN OGLING A PRETTY GIRL AS WAS THE CASE WITH FATHER GILLENORMAND BUT WHEN CONTEMPLATING AN OLD BOOK HE LIVED ALONE WITH AN OLD HOUSEKEEPER HE WAS SOMEWHAT GOUTY
4313-9937-0012 AND WHEN HE WAS ASLEEP HIS AGED FINGERS STIFFENED WITH RHEUMATISM LAY CROOKED UP IN THE FOLDS OF HIS SHEETS HE HAD COMPOSED AND PUBLISHED A FLORA OF THE ENVIRONS OF CAUTERETZ WITH COLORED PLATES
4313-9937-0013 A WORK WHICH ENJOYED A TOLERABLE MEASURE OF ESTEEM AND WHICH SOLD WELL PEOPLE RANG HIS BELL
4313-9937-0014 TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY TO ASK FOR IT HE DREW AS MUCH AS TWO THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR FROM IT THIS CONSTITUTED NEARLY THE WHOLE OF HIS FORTUNE
4313-9937-0015 HE HAD HAD THE TALENT TO FORM FOR HIMSELF BY DINT OF PATIENCE PRIVATIONS AND TIME A PRECIOUS COLLECTION OF RARE COPIES OF EVERY SORT HE NEVER WENT OUT WITHOUT A BOOK UNDER HIS ARM AND HE OFTEN RETURNED WITH TWO
4313-9937-0016 THE SOLE DECORATION OF THE FOUR ROOMS ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH COMPOSED HIS LODGINGS CONSISTED OF FRAMED HERBARIUMS AND ENGRAVINGS OF THE OLD MASTERS THE SIGHT OF A SWORD OR A GUN CHILLED HIS BLOOD
4313-9937-0017 HE HAD NEVER APPROACHED A CANNON IN HIS LIFE EVEN AT THE INVALIDES HE HAD A PASSABLE STOMACH A BROTHER WHO WAS A CURE PERFECTLY WHITE HAIR NO TEETH EITHER IN HIS MOUTH OR HIS MIND
4313-9937-0018 A TREMBLING IN EVERY LIMB A PICARD ACCENT
4313-9937-0019 THE AIR OF AN OLD SHEEP AND HE WAS EASILY FRIGHTENED ADD TO THIS THAT HE HAD NO OTHER FRIENDSHIP NO OTHER ACQUAINTANCE AMONG THE LIVING
4313-9937-0020 HIS SERVANT WAS ALSO A SORT OF INNOCENT THE POOR GOOD OLD WOMAN WAS A SPINSTER SULTAN HER CAT WHICH MIGHT HAVE MEWED ALLEGRI'S MISERERE IN THE SIXTINE CHAPEL
4313-9937-0021 HAD FILLED HER HEART AND SUFFICED FOR THE QUANTITY OF PASSION WHICH EXISTED IN HER NONE OF HER DREAMS HAD EVER PROCEEDED AS FAR AS MAN SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET FURTHER THAN HER CAT LIKE HIM SHE HAD A MUSTACHE
4313-9937-0022 HER GLORY CONSISTED IN HER CAPS WHICH WERE ALWAYS WHITE SHE PASSED HER TIME ON SUNDAYS AFTER MASS IN COUNTING OVER THE LINEN IN HER CHEST
4313-9937-0023 SHE KNEW HOW TO READ
4313-9937-0024 WARMED HIS AGE WITHOUT STARTLING HIS TIMIDITY YOUTH COMBINED WITH GENTLENESS PRODUCES ON OLD PEOPLE THE EFFECT OF THE SUN WITHOUT WIND WHEN MARIUS WAS SATURATED WITH MILITARY GLORY WITH GUNPOWDER
4313-9937-0025 WITH MARCHES AND COUNTERMARCHES AND WITH ALL THOSE PRODIGIOUS BATTLES IN WHICH HIS FATHER HAD GIVEN
4313-9937-0026 THE REVOLUTION OF JULY BROUGHT A CRISIS TO PUBLISHING IN A PERIOD OF EMBARRASSMENT THE FIRST THING WHICH DOES NOT SELL IS A FLORA THE FLORA OF THE ENVIRONS OF CAUTERETZ STOPPED SHORT
4313-9937-0027 WEEKS PASSED BY WITHOUT A SINGLE PURCHASER
4313-9937-0028 MONSIEUR SAID MOTHER PLUTARQUE SADLY IT IS THE WATER CARRIER IN SHORT ONE DAY
4313-9937-0029 ABDICATED THE FUNCTIONS OF WARDEN
4313-9937-0030 AND INSTALLED HIMSELF IN A LITTLE HOUSE ON THE RUE MONTPARNASSE WHERE HOWEVER HE REMAINED BUT ONE QUARTER FOR TWO REASONS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE GROUND FLOOR AND THE GARDEN COST THREE HUNDRED FRANCS
4313-9937-0031 AND HE DARED NOT SPEND MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FRANCS ON HIS RENT IN THE SECOND BEING NEAR FATON'S SHOOTING GALLERY HE COULD HEAR THE PISTOL SHOTS WHICH WAS INTOLERABLE TO HIM HE CARRIED OFF HIS FLORA HIS COPPER PLATES HIS HERBARIUMS
4313-9937-0032 HIS PORTFOLIOS AND HIS BOOKS AND ESTABLISHED HIMSELF NEAR THE SALPETRIERE IN A SORT OF THATCHED COTTAGE OF THE VILLAGE OF AUSTERLITZ WHERE FOR FIFTY CROWNS A YEAR HE GOT THREE ROOMS AND A GARDEN ENCLOSED BY A HEDGE AND CONTAINING A WELL
4313-9937-0033 HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS REMOVAL TO SELL OFF NEARLY ALL HIS FURNITURE ON THE DAY OF HIS ENTRANCE INTO HIS NEW QUARTERS HE WAS VERY GAY AND DROVE THE NAILS ON WHICH HIS ENGRAVINGS AND HERBARIUMS WERE TO HANG WITH HIS OWN HANDS
4313-9937-0034 DUG IN HIS GARDEN THE REST OF THE DAY AND AT NIGHT PERCEIVING THAT MOTHER PLUTARQUE HAD A MELANCHOLY AIR AND WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL HE TAPPED HER ON THE SHOULDER AND SAID TO HER WITH A SMILE WE HAVE THE INDIGO ONLY TWO VISITORS
4313-9937-0035 WERE ADMITTED TO VIEW THE THATCHED COTTAGE AT AUSTERLITZ A BRAWLING NAME WHICH WAS TO TELL THE TRUTH EXTREMELY DISAGREEABLE TO HIM HOWEVER AS WE HAVE JUST POINTED OUT BRAINS WHICH ARE ABSORBED IN SOME BIT OF WISDOM OR FOLLY
4313-9937-0036 OR AS IT OFTEN HAPPENS IN BOTH AT ONCE ARE BUT SLOWLY ACCESSIBLE TO THE THINGS OF ACTUAL LIFE THEIR OWN DESTINY IS A FAR OFF THING TO THEM THERE RESULTS FROM SUCH CONCENTRATION A PASSIVITY WHICH
4313-9937-0037 IF IT WERE THE OUTCOME OF REASONING WOULD RESEMBLE PHILOSOPHY ONE DECLINES DESCENDS TRICKLES AWAY EVEN CRUMBLES AWAY AND YET IS HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF IT ONE'S SELF IT ALWAYS ENDS IT IS TRUE IN AN AWAKENING
4313-9937-0038 BUT THE AWAKENING IS TARDY IN THE MEANTIME IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WE HELD OURSELVES NEUTRAL IN THE GAME WHICH IS GOING ON BETWEEN OUR HAPPINESS AND OUR UNHAPPINESS WE ARE THE STAKE AND WE LOOK ON AT THE GAME WITH INDIFFERENCE
4313-9937-0039 IT IS THUS THAT ATHWART THE CLOUD WHICH FORMED ABOUT HIM WHEN ALL HIS HOPES WERE EXTINGUISHED ONE AFTER THE OTHER
4313-9937-0040 BUT PROFOUNDLY SERENE HIS HABITS OF MIND HAD THE REGULAR SWING OF A PENDULUM ONCE MOUNTED ON AN ILLUSION HE WENT FOR A VERY LONG TIME EVEN AFTER THE ILLUSION HAD DISAPPEARED
4313-9937-0041 A CLOCK DOES NOT STOP SHORT AT THE PRECISE MOMENT WHEN THE KEY IS LOST
4313-9937-0042 THESE PLEASURES WERE INEXPENSIVE AND UNEXPECTED THE MEREST CHANCE FURNISHED THEM ONE DAY MOTHER PLUTARQUE WAS READING A ROMANCE IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM SHE WAS READING ALOUD FINDING THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD BETTER THUS
4313-9937-0043 TO READ ALOUD IS TO ASSURE ONE'S SELF OF WHAT ONE IS READING THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO READ VERY LOUD AND WHO HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF GIVING THEMSELVES THEIR WORD OF HONOR AS TO WHAT THEY ARE PERUSING
4313-9937-0044 MOTHER PLUTARQUE CAME TO THIS PHRASE IT WAS A QUESTION OF AN OFFICER OF DRAGOONS AND A BEAUTY THE BEAUTY POUTED AND THE DRAGOON HERE SHE INTERRUPTED HERSELF TO WIPE HER GLASSES
4313-9937-0045 YES IT IS TRUE THAT THERE WAS A DRAGON WHICH FROM THE DEPTHS OF ITS CAVE SPOUTED FLAME THROUGH HIS MAW AND SET THE HEAVENS ON FIRE MANY STARS HAD ALREADY BEEN CONSUMED BY THIS MONSTER WHICH BESIDES HAD THE CLAWS OF A TIGER
4313-9937-0046 BOUDDHA WENT INTO ITS DEN AND SUCCEEDED IN CONVERTING THE DRAGON THAT IS A GOOD BOOK THAT YOU ARE READING MOTHER PLUTARQUE THERE IS NO MORE BEAUTIFUL LEGEND IN EXISTENCE
