1085-156170-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN PASSAGE OF THE JORDAN AND NOW DTHEMETRI BEGAN TO ENTER INTO A NEGOTIATION WITH MY HOSTS FOR A PASSAGE OVER THE RIVER
1085-156170-0001 I NEVER INTERFERED WITH MY WORTHY DRAGOMAN UPON THESE OCCASIONS BECAUSE FROM MY ENTIRE IGNORANCE OF THE ARABIC
1085-156170-0002 I SHOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE UNABLE TO EXERCISE ANY REAL CONTROL OVER HIS WORDS AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SILLY TO BREAK THE STREAM OF HIS ELOQUENCE TO NO PURPOSE I HAVE REASON TO FEAR HOWEVER THAT HE LIED TRANSCENDENTLY
1085-156170-0003 THE GROUNDS OF THE INFINITE RESPECT WHICH HE AND HIS TRIBE ENTERTAINED FOR THE PASHA A FEW WEEKS BEFORE IBRAHIM HAD CRAFTILY SENT A BODY OF TROOPS ACROSS THE JORDAN THE FORCE WENT WARILY ROUND TO THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS ON THE EAST
1085-156170-0004 SO AS TO CUT OFF THE RETREAT OF THIS TRIBE AND THEN SURROUNDED THEM AS THEY LAY ENCAMPED IN THE VALE
1085-156170-0005 WERE CARRIED OFF BY THE SOLDIERY
1085-156170-0006 MIGHT NOT PROCURE FOR HIS FRIEND A VERY GRACIOUS RECEPTION AMONGST THE PEOPLE WHOM HE HAD THUS DESPOILED AND DECIMATED BUT THE ASIATIC SEEMS TO BE ANIMATED WITH A FEELING OF PROFOUND RESPECT ALMOST BORDERING UPON AFFECTION
1085-156170-0007 FOR ALL WHO HAVE DONE HIM ANY BOLD AND VIOLENT WRONG
1085-156170-0008 WHEN IT IS WROUGHT UPON BY THE IDEA OF POWER AFTER SOME DISCUSSION THE ARABS AGREED AS I THOUGHT TO CONDUCT ME TO A FORD AND WE MOVED ON TOWARDS THE RIVER FOLLOWED BY SEVENTEEN OF THE MOST ABLE BODIED OF THE TRIBE
1085-156170-0009 UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF SEVERAL GREY BEARDED ELDERS
1085-156170-0010 UPON LEAVING THE ENCAMPMENT A SORT OF CEREMONY WAS PERFORMED FOR THE PURPOSE IT SEEMED OF ENSURING IF POSSIBLE A HAPPY RESULT FOR THE UNDERTAKING
1085-156170-0011 THE TENTED ARABS ARE LOOKED UPON AS VERY BAD MAHOMETANS WE ARRIVED UPON THE BANKS OF THE RIVERNOT
1085-156170-0012 BUT AT A DEEP AND RAPID PART OF THE STREAM AND I NOW UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS THE PLAN OF THESE MEN IF THEY HELPED ME AT ALL TO TRANSPORT ME ACROSS THE RIVER BY SOME SPECIES OF RAFT BUT A REACTION HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE OPINIONS OF MANY
1085-156170-0013 THE FELLOWS ALL GATHERED TOGETHER IN CIRCLE AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM MY PARTY AND THERE DISPUTED WITH GREAT VEHEMENCE AND FURY FOR NEARLY TWO HOURS I CANT GIVE A CORRECT REPORT OF THE DEBATE
1085-156170-0014 FOR IT WAS HELD IN A BARBAROUS DIALECT OF THE ARABIC UNKNOWN TO MY DRAGOMAN I RECOLLECT I SINCERELY FELT AT THE TIME THAT THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF ROBBING ME MUST HAVE BEEN ALMOST UNANSWERABLE
1085-156170-0015 AND I GAVE GREAT CREDIT TO THE SPEAKERS ON MY SIDE FOR THE INGENUITY AND SOPHISTRY WHICH THEY MUST HAVE SHOWN IN MAINTAINING THE FIGHT SO WELL DURING THE DISCUSSION I REMAINED LYING IN FRONT OF MY BAGGAGE
1085-156170-0016 WHICH HAD ALL BEEN TAKEN FROM THE PACK SADDLES AND PLACED UPON THE GROUND I WAS SO LANGUID FROM WANT OF FOOD THAT I HAD SCARCELY ANIMATION ENOUGH TO FEEL AS DEEPLY INTERESTED AS YOU WOULD SUPPOSE IN THE RESULT OF THE DISCUSSION
1085-156170-0017 I THOUGHT HOWEVER THAT THE PLEASANTEST TOYS TO PLAY WITH DURING THIS INTERVAL WERE MY PISTOLS AND NOW AND THEN WHEN I LISTLESSLY VISITED MY LOADED BARRELS WITH THE SWIVEL RAMRODS OR DREW A SWEET MUSICAL CLICK FROM MY ENGLISH FIRELOCKS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I EXERCISED A SLIGHT AND GENTLE INFLUENCE ON THE DEBATE
1085-156170-0018 THANKS TO IBRAHIM PASHAS TERRIBLE VISITATION THE MEN OF THE TRIBE WERE WHOLLY UNARMED AND MY ADVANTAGE IN THIS RESPECT MIGHT HAVE COUNTERBALANCED IN SOME MEASURE THE SUPERIORITY OF NUMBERS MYSSERI NOT INTERPRETING IN ARABIC
1085-156170-0019 HAD NO DUTY TO PERFORM AND HE SEEMED TO BE FAINT AND LISTLESS AS MYSELF SHEREEF LOOKED PERFECTLY RESIGNED TO ANY FATE BUT DTHEMETRI FAITHFUL TERRIER WAS BRISTLING WITH ZEAL AND WATCHFULNESS
1085-156170-0020 HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE DEBATE WHICH INDEED WAS CARRIED ON AT A DISTANCE TOO GREAT TO BE EASILY HEARD EVEN IF THE LANGUAGE HAD BEEN FAMILIAR BUT HE WAS ALWAYS ON THE ALERT AND NOW AND THEN CONFERRING WITH MEN WHO HAD STRAGGLED OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY
1085-156170-0021 AT LAST HE FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING A PROPOSAL WHICH AT ONCE PRODUCED IMMENSE SENSATION HE OFFERED ON MY BEHALF THAT IF THE TRIBE SHOULD BEAR THEMSELVES LOYALLY TOWARDS ME
1085-156170-0022 AND TAKE MY PARTY AND MY BAGGAGE IN SAFETY TO THE OTHER BANK OF THE RIVER I SHOULD GIVE THEM A TESKERI OR WRITTEN CERTIFICATE OF THEIR GOOD CONDUCT WHICH MIGHT AVAIL THEM HEREAFTER IN THE HOUR OF THEIR DIREST NEED
1085-156170-0023 THIS PROPOSAL WAS RECEIVED AND INSTANTLY ACCEPTED BY ALL THE MEN OF THE TRIBE THERE PRESENT WITH THE UTMOST ENTHUSIASM I WAS TO GIVE THE MEN TOO A BAKSHEISH THAT IS A PRESENT OF MONEY
1085-156170-0024 WHICH IS USUALLY MADE UPON THE CONCLUSION OF ANY SORT OF TREATY BUT ALTHOUGH THE PEOPLE OF THE TRIBE WERE SO MISERABLY POOR THEY SEEMED TO LOOK UPON THE PECUNIARY PART OF THE ARRANGEMENT AS A MATTER QUITE TRIVIAL IN COMPARISON WITH THE TESKERI
1085-156170-0025 AND NOT THE SLIGHTEST ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO EXTORT ANY FURTHER REWARD
1085-156170-0026 AND OVERWHELMED ME WITH VEHEMENT GRATULATIONS THEY CARESSED MY BOOTS WITH MUCH AFFECTION AND MY HANDS WERE SEVERELY KISSED THE ARABS NOW WENT TO WORK IN RIGHT EARNEST TO EFFECT THE PASSAGE OF THE RIVER
1085-156170-0027 AND FASTENED SEVERAL OF THEM TO SMALL BOUGHS WHICH THEY CUT FROM THE BANKS OF THE RIVER IN THIS WAY THEY CONSTRUCTED A RAFT NOT MORE THAN ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE FEET SQUARE BUT RENDERED BUOYANT BY THE INFLATED SKINS WHICH SUPPORTED IT
1085-156170-0028 ON THIS A PORTION OF MY BAGGAGE WAS PLACED AND WAS FIRMLY TIED TO IT BY THE CORDS USED ON MY PACK SADDLES THE LITTLE RAFT WITH ITS WEIGHTY CARGO WAS THEN GENTLY LIFTED INTO THE WATER
1085-156170-0029 AND I HAD THE SATISFACTION TO SEE THAT IT FLOATED WELL TWELVE OF THE ARABS NOW STRIPPED AND TIED INFLATED SKINS TO THEIR LOINS
1085-156170-0030 SIX OF THE MEN WENT DOWN INTO THE RIVER GOT IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE RAFT AND PULLED IT OFF A FEW FEET FROM THE BANK THE OTHER SIX THEN DASHED INTO THE STREAM WITH LOUD SHOUTS AND SWAM ALONG AFTER THE RAFT PUSHING IT FROM BEHIND
1085-156170-0031 OFF WENT THE CRAFT IN CAPITAL STYLE AT FIRST FOR THE STREAM WAS EASY ON THE EASTERN SIDE BUT I SAW THAT THE TUG WAS TO COME FOR THE MAIN TORRENT SWEPT ROUND IN A BEND NEAR THE WESTERN BANK OF THE RIVER
1085-156170-0032 THE OLD MEN WITH THEIR LONG GREY GRISLY BEARDS STOOD SHOUTING AND CHEERING PRAYING AND COMMANDING AT LENGTH THE RAFT ENTERED UPON THE DIFFICULT PART OF ITS COURSE THE WHIRLING STREAM SEIZED AND TWISTED IT ABOUT
1085-156170-0033 AND THEN BORE IT RAPIDLY DOWNWARDS
1085-156170-0034 SENT FORTH A CRY AND A SHOUT THAT TORE THE WIDE AIR INTO TATTERS AND THEN TO MAKE THEIR URGING YET MORE STRONG THEY SHRIEKED OUT THE DREADFUL SYLLABLES BRAHIM PASHA THE SWIMMERS ONE MOMENT BEFORE SO BLOWN AND SO WEARY
1085-156170-0035 FOUND LUNGS TO ANSWER THE CRY AND SHOUTING BACK THE NAME OF THEIR GREAT DESTROYER THEY DASHED ON THROUGH THE TORRENT AND BORE THE RAFT IN SAFETY TO THE WESTERN BANK AFTERWARDS THE SWIMMERS RETURNED WITH THE RAFT
1085-156170-0036 I TOOK MY SEAT UPON THE TOP OF THE CARGO AND THE RAFT THUS LADEN PASSED THE RIVER IN THE SAME WAY AND WITH THE SAME STRUGGLE AS BEFORE THE SKINS HOWEVER NOT BEING PERFECTLY AIR TIGHT HAD LOST A GREAT PART OF THEIR BUOYANCY
1085-156170-0037 GOT WET IN THE WATERS OF JORDAN THE RAFT COULD NOT BE TRUSTED FOR ANOTHER TRIP AND THE REST OF MY PARTY PASSED THE RIVER IN A DIFFERENT AND FOR THEM MUCH SAFER WAY
1085-156170-0038 INFLATED SKINS WERE FASTENED TO THEIR LOINS AND THUS SUPPORTED THEY WERE TUGGED ACROSS BY ARABS SWIMMING ON EITHER SIDE OF THEM THE HORSES AND MULES WERE THROWN INTO THE WATER AND FORCED TO SWIM OVER
1085-156170-0039 THE POOR BEASTS HAD A HARD STRUGGLE FOR THEIR LIVES IN THAT SWIFT STREAM AND I THOUGHT THAT ONE OF THE HORSES WOULD HAVE BEEN DROWNED FOR HE WAS TOO WEAK TO GAIN A FOOTING ON THE WESTERN BANK AND THE STREAM BORE HIM DOWN
1085-156170-0040 HE POOR FELLOW WAS SHIVERING ON THE EASTERN BANK FOR HIS DREAD OF THE PASSAGE WAS SO GREAT THAT HE DELAYED IT AS LONG AS HE COULD
1085-156170-0041 I LAY THAT NIGHT ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER AND AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM ME THE ARABS KINDLED A FIRE ROUND WHICH THEY SAT IN A CIRCLE THEY WERE MADE MOST SAVAGELY HAPPY BY THE TOBACCO WITH WHICH I SUPPLIED THEM
1085-156170-0042 AND THEY SOON DETERMINED THAT THE WHOLE NIGHT SHOULD BE ONE SMOKING FESTIVAL THE POOR FELLOWS HAD ONLY A CRACKED BOWL
1085-156170-0043 IN THAT WAY THEY PASSED THE WHOLE NIGHT THE NEXT MORNING OLD SHEREEF WAS BROUGHT ACROSS IT WAS A STRANGE SIGHT TO SEE THIS SOLEMN OLD MUSSULMAN WITH HIS SHAVEN HEAD AND HIS SACRED BEARD
1085-156170-0044 SPRAWLING AND PUFFING UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHEN AT LAST HE REACHED THE BANK THE PEOPLE TOLD HIM THAT BY HIS BAPTISM IN JORDAN HE HAD SURELY BECOME A MERE CHRISTIAN
1085-156170-0045 POOR SHEREEF THE HOLY MAN THE DESCENDANT OF THE PROPHET HE WAS SADLY HURT BY THE TAUNT AND THE MORE SO AS HE SEEMED TO FEEL THAT THERE WAS SOME FOUNDATION FOR IT
1085-156170-0046 AND THAT HE REALLY MIGHT HAVE ABSORBED SOME CHRISTIAN ERRORS WHEN ALL WAS READY FOR DEPARTURE
1085-156170-0047 TOGETHER WITH THE PROMISED BAKSHEISH HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY GRATEFUL AND I PARTED IN A VERY FRIENDLY WAY FROM THIS RAGGED TRIBE IN TWO OR THREE HOURS I GAINED RIHAH
1085-156170-0048 A VILLAGE SAID TO OCCUPY THE SITE OF ANCIENT JERICHO
