8855-283242-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY TWO THE NEXT THING AS I SAT IN MY STUDY IN THE TWILIGHT OF THAT SAME DAY THE DOOR WAS HURRIEDLY OPENED AND JUDY ENTERED SHE LOOKED ABOUT THE ROOM WITH A QUICK GLANCE TO SEE THAT WE WERE ALONE THEN CAUGHT MY HAND IN BOTH OF HERS
8855-283242-0001 AND BURST OUT CRYING WHY JUDY I SAID WHAT IS THE MATTER BUT THE SOBS WOULD NOT ALLOW HER TO ANSWER I WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO PUT ANY MORE QUESTIONS AND SO STOOD SILENT MY CHEST FEELING LIKE AN EMPTY TOMB THAT WAITED FOR DEATH TO FILL IT
8855-283242-0002 AT LENGTH WITH A STRONG EFFORT SHE CHECKED THE SUCCESSION OF HER SOBS AND SPOKE THEY ARE KILLING AUNTIE SHE LOOKS LIKE A GHOST ALREADY SAID THE CHILD AGAIN BURSTING INTO TEARS TELL ME JUDY WHAT CAN I DO FOR HER YOU MUST FIND OUT MISTER WALTON
8855-283242-0003 IF YOU LOVED HER AS MUCH AS I DO YOU WOULD FIND OUT WHAT TO DO BUT SHE WILL NOT LET ME DO ANYTHING FOR HER YES SHE WILL SHE SAYS YOU PROMISED TO HELP HER SOME DAY DID SHE SEND YOU THEN NO SHE DID NOT SEND ME
8855-283242-0004 THEN HOW WHAT WHAT CAN I DO OH YOU EXACT PEOPLE YOU MUST HAVE EVERYTHING SQUARE AND IN PRINT BEFORE YOU MOVE IF IT HAD BEEN ME NOW WOULDN'T I HAVE BEEN OFF LIKE A SHOT DO GET YOUR HAT MISTER WALTON
8855-283242-0005 WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT AS WE GO SAID JUDY AUTHORITATIVELY IN A MOMENT MORE WE WERE IN THE OPEN AIR IT WAS A STILL NIGHT WITH AN ODOUR OF DAMP EARTH AND A HINT OF GREEN BUDS IN IT A PALE HALF MOON HUNG IN THE SKY
8855-283242-0006 NOW AND THEN HIDDEN BY THE CLOUDS THAT SWEPT ACROSS IT FOR THERE WAS WIND IN THE HEAVENS THOUGH UPON EARTH ALL WAS STILL I OFFERED JUDY MY ARM BUT SHE TOOK MY HAND AND WE WALKED ON WITHOUT A WORD TILL WE HAD GOT THROUGH THE VILLAGE AND OUT UPON THE ROAD
8855-283242-0007 IS SHE ILL SHE IS AS WHITE AS A SHEET AND WILL NOT LEAVE HER ROOM GRANNIE MUST HAVE FRIGHTENED HER DREADFULLY EVERYBODY IS FRIGHTENED AT HER BUT ME AND I BEGIN TO BE FRIGHTENED TOO AND WHAT WILL BECOME OF AUNTIE THEN BUT WHAT CAN HER MOTHER DO TO HER
8855-283242-0008 I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT IS HER DETERMINATION TO HAVE HER OWN WAY THAT MAKES AUNTIE AFRAID SHE WILL GET IT SOMEHOW AND SHE SAYS NOW SHE WILL RATHER DIE THAN MARRY CAPTAIN EVERARD THEN THERE IS NO ONE ALLOWED TO WAIT ON HER BUT SARAH
8855-283242-0009 AND I KNOW THE VERY SIGHT OF HER IS ENOUGH TO TURN AUNTIE SICK ALMOST WHAT HAS BECOME OF JANE I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T SEEN HER ALL DAY AND THE SERVANTS ARE WHISPERING TOGETHER MORE THAN USUAL
8855-283242-0010 ELSE I SHOULD ALMOST FANCY SHE WAS STARVING HERSELF TO DEATH TO KEEP CLEAR OF THAT CAPTAIN EVERARD IS HE STILL AT THE HALL YES BUT I DON'T THINK IT IS ALTOGETHER HIS FAULT GRANNIE WON'T LET HIM GO I DON'T BELIEVE HE KNOWS HOW DETERMINED AUNTIE IS NOT TO MARRY HIM
8855-283242-0011 I DARESAY HE WOULD NOT CARE MUCH MORE THAN GRANNIE WHETHER SHE WAS WILLING OR NOT SO LONG AS SHE MARRIED HIM
8855-283242-0012 THEY WILL BE AT DINNER THE CAPTAIN AND GRANNIE I WILL LEAVE YOU THERE AND TELL AUNTIE THAT YOU WANT TO SEE HER BUT JUDY DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE HER MISTER WALTON YES I DO MORE THAN YOU CAN THINK THEN I WILL TELL HER SO
8855-283242-0013 BUT WILL SHE COME TO ME I DON'T KNOW WE HAVE TO FIND THAT OUT VERY WELL I LEAVE MYSELF IN YOUR HANDS I WAS NOW PERFECTLY COLLECTED ALL MY DUBITATION AND DISTRESS WERE GONE FOR I HAD SOMETHING TO DO
8855-283242-0014 BUT WAS UTTERLY WITHOUT WEAPONS AND THERE WAS A DANGER OF HER CONDUCT AND THEN OF HER MIND GIVING WAY AT LAST
8855-283242-0015 IN RESPECT OF THIS I PRAYED HEARTILY THAT I MIGHT HELP HER JUDY AND I SCARCELY SPOKE TO EACH OTHER FROM THE MOMENT WE ENTERED THE GATE TILL I FOUND MYSELF AT A SIDE DOOR WHICH I HAD NEVER OBSERVED TILL NOW IT WAS FASTENED AND JUDY TOLD ME TO WAIT TILL SHE WENT IN AND OPENED IT
8855-283242-0016 THE MOON WAS NOW QUITE OBSCURED AND I WAS UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DISCOVERY WHILE I STOOD THERE I COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF DOCTOR DUNCAN'S STORY AND REFLECTING THAT THE DAUGHTER WAS NOW RETURNING THE KINDNESS SHOWN TO THE MOTHER
8855-283242-0017 I HAD NOT TO WAIT LONG BEFORE THE DOOR OPENED BEHIND ME NOISELESSLY AND I STEPPED INTO THE DARK HOUSE JUDY TOOK ME BY THE HAND AND LED ME ALONG A PASSAGE AND THEN UP A STAIR INTO THE LITTLE DRAWING ROOM THERE WAS NO LIGHT
8855-283242-0018 SHE LED ME TO A SEAT AT THE FARTHER END AND OPENING A DOOR CLOSE BESIDE ME LEFT ME IN THE DARK THERE I SAT SO LONG THAT I FELL INTO A FIT OF MUSING BROKEN EVER BY STARTLED EXPECTATION CASTLE AFTER CASTLE I BUILT UP
8855-283242-0019 CASTLE AFTER CASTLE FELL TO PIECES IN MY HANDS STILL SHE DID NOT COME AT LENGTH I GOT SO RESTLESS AND EXCITED THAT ONLY THE DARKNESS KEPT ME FROM STARTING UP AND PACING THE ROOM STILL SHE DID NOT COME AND PARTLY FROM WEAKNESS PARTLY FROM HOPE DEFERRED
8855-283242-0020 I FOUND MYSELF BEGINNING TO TREMBLE ALL OVER NOR COULD I CONTROL MYSELF AS THE TREMBLING INCREASED I GREW ALARMED LEST I SHOULD BECOME UNABLE TO CARRY OUT ALL THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY SUDDENLY FROM OUT OF THE DARK A HAND SETTLED ON MY ARM
8855-283242-0021 I LOOKED UP AND COULD JUST SEE THE WHITENESS OF A FACE BEFORE I COULD SPEAK A VOICE SAID BROKENLY IN A HALF WHISPER WILL YOU SAVE ME MISTER WALTON BUT YOU'RE TREMBLING YOU ARE ILL
8855-283242-0022 I WILL GET YOU SOMETHING AND SHE MOVED TO GO BUT I HELD HER ALL MY TREMBLING WAS GONE IN A MOMENT HER WORDS SO CAREFUL OF ME EVEN IN HER DEEP MISERY WENT TO MY HEART AND GAVE ME STRENGTH THE SUPPRESSED FEELINGS OF MANY MONTHS RUSHED TO MY LIPS
8855-283242-0023 I AM SELFISHNESS ITSELF TO SPEAK TO YOU THUS NOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR MISERY TO MAKE YOU LISTEN TO MINE BUT AT LEAST IT WILL MAKE YOU SURE THAT IF ALL I AM ALL I HAVE WILL SAVE YOU BUT I AM SAVED ALREADY SHE INTERPOSED IF YOU LOVE ME
8855-283242-0024 FOR I LOVE YOU AND FOR SOME MOMENTS THERE WERE NO WORDS TO SPEAK I STOOD HOLDING HER HAND CONSCIOUS ONLY OF GOD AND HER AT LAST I SAID THERE IS NO TIME NOW BUT FOR ACTION NOR DO I SEE ANYTHING BUT TO GO WITH ME AT ONCE
8855-283242-0025 WILL YOU COME HOME TO MY SISTER OR I WILL TAKE YOU WHEREVER YOU PLEASE I WILL GO WITH YOU ANYWHERE YOU THINK BEST ONLY TAKE ME AWAY PUT ON YOUR BONNET THEN AND A WARM CLOAK AND WE WILL SETTLE ALL ABOUT IT AS WE GO

8855-283242-0027 I MUST TAKE HER IN HAND I HAD BEEN IN GREAT PERPLEXITY HOW TO LET HER KNOW THAT I WAS THERE FOR TO ANNOUNCE YOURSELF TO A LADY BY A VOICE OUT OF THE DARKNESS OF HER BOUDOIR OR TO WAIT FOR CANDLES TO DISCOVER YOU WHERE SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS QUITE ALONE
8855-283242-0028 NEITHER IS A PLEASANT WAY OF PRESENTING YOURSELF TO HER CONSCIOUSNESS BUT I WAS HELPED OUT OF THE BEGINNING INTO THE MIDDLE OF MY DIFFICULTIES ONCE MORE BY THAT BLESSED LITTLE JUDY I DID NOT KNOW SHE WAS IN THE ROOM TILL I HEARD HER VOICE
8855-283242-0029 NOR DO I YET KNOW HOW MUCH SHE HAD HEARD OF THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN HER AUNT AND MYSELF FOR ALTHOUGH I SOMETIMES SEE HER LOOK ROGUISH EVEN NOW THAT SHE IS A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN WITH MANY CHILDREN WHEN ANYTHING IS SAID WHICH MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A POSSIBLE REFERENCE TO THAT NIGHT
8855-283242-0030 HERE I AM GRANNIE SAID HER VOICE BUT I WON'T BE TAKEN IN HAND BY YOU OR ANY ONE ELSE I TELL YOU THAT SO MIND AND MISTER WALTON IS HERE TOO AND AUNT ETHELWYN IS GOING OUT WITH HIM FOR A LONG WALK

8855-283242-0038 I SAID MISSUS OLDCASTLE TURNED SLIGHTLY LIVID WITH WRATH SHE WAS ALWAYS WHITE AS I HAVE SAID THE CHANGE I CAN DESCRIBE ONLY BY THE WORD I HAVE USED INDICATING A BLUISH DARKENING OF THE WHITENESS SHE WALKED TOWARDS THE DOOR BESIDE ME
