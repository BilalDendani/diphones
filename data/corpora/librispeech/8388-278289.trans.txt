8388-278289-0000 BUT TAKE NOTE THOUGH THOU SEEST ME IN THE GREATEST DANGER ON EARTH THOU MUST NOT SET THY HAND TO THY SWORD TO DEFEND ME UNLESS THOU SHOULDST PERCEIVE THAT THEY WHO ASSAIL ME ARE RABBLE AND LOW PEOPLE IN WHICH CASE THOU CANST COME TO MY AID DON QUIXOTE
8388-278289-0001 IT WAS EARLY EVENING OCTOBER FIFTH AT GREEN'S RANCH THE SOMBER QUIET OF THE PLACE SEEMED TO INDICATE A DESERTED ESTATE BUT A DIM LIGHT IN THE WINDOW INVITED ME TO KNOCK AT ONCE I HEARD FEET SHUFFLE ACROSS THE FLOOR AND A BOLT SLIDE IN THE DOOR
8388-278289-0002 WHO BE YOU CALLED A WOMAN DISTINCTLY I INTRODUCED MYSELF THROUGH THE KEY HOLE AND WAS ADMITTED
8388-278289-0003 THE IDEA THAT A FRONTIER WOMAN SHOULD BE SO EASILY FRIGHTENED SEEMED RIDICULOUS HAVEN'T YOU HEARD SHE RETURNED WHY THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS UP IN ARMS LOOKING FOR TWO DESPERATE OUTLAWS THEY SHOT A SHEEP HERDER LAST NIGHT IN TELEGRAPH CANYON
8388-278289-0004 AND AFTER ROBBING THE FELLOW OF FOUR DOLLARS LEFT HIM FOR DEAD MISTER GREEN WENT TO EGAN CANYON THIS AFTERNOON FOR THE MAIL AND HASN'T RETURNED
8388-278289-0005 I SAID WE WERE WELL PROVIDED WITH FOOD AND FIRE ARMS THAT SHE MIGHT FEEL QUITE SAFE FROM THE BRIGANDS NOW COONSKIN CALLED FOR ME AND SAID OUR EVENING MEAL WAS UNDER WAY SO I BADE MISSUS GREEN A GOOD NIGHT
8388-278289-0006 COONSKIN WHOSE CHIEF LITERARY DIET HAD BEEN DIME NOVELS LISTENED TO THE NEWS WITH RAPT ATTENTION
8388-278289-0007 GEE WOULDN'T I LIKE TO CAPTURE EM THOUGH HE SAID ENTHUSIASTICALLY
8388-278289-0008 SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT WE'LL MEET THESE OUTLAWS SUPPER OVER AND DISHES WASHED WE RETIRED
8388-278289-0009 THE NIGHT WAS COOL AND A GENTLE BREEZE WAS BLOWING
8388-278289-0010 SUDDENLY I HEARD DON WHO WAS ON GUARD GROWL THEN A SOUND OF WHEELS AND A HORSE'S WHINNY WILL YOUR DOG BITE MISTER POD CALLED MISTER GREEN
8388-278289-0011 OH HE CHUCKLED ANYBODY WOULD KNOW YOU BY YOUR OUTFIT BESIDES EVERYBODY ALONG THE TRAIL HAS BEEN EXPECTING YOU EVEN TWO DESPERADOES THIS WAS INTERESTING
8388-278289-0012 WHILE AT BREAKFAST I LEARNED THAT THE SALT LAKE NEWSPAPERS CONTAINING ILLUSTRATED ACCOUNTS OF MY PROSPERITY HAD SUBSCRIBERS ALL ALONG THE TRAIL THAT THE SHOOTING AT TELEGRAPH CANYON WAS THE FIRST IN THAT SECTION FOR SIXTEEN YEARS
8388-278289-0013 THAT NO PAY BOXES WERE EXPECTED AT THE EGAN MILL WHERE A HALF DOZEN MEN WERE WORKING AND THAT WHAT WAS OF MORE IMPORTANCE THAN THE REST IT WAS THE PREVAILING OPINION THAT PYE POD WAS THE MAN THE OUTLAWS WERE LAYING FOR GRISWOLD IS THE UNFORTUNATE MAN'S NAME SAID GREEN
8388-278289-0014 THE OUTLAWS PRETENDED TO BE FRIENDLY LUNCHED WITH HIM AND STARTED OFF ON THEIR HORSES BUT GRISWOLD HAD NO SOONER TURNED HIS BACK THAN THE STRANGERS ORDERED HIM TO THROW UP HIS HANDS THEY TOOK ALL HIS FUNDS SHOT HIM AND GALLOPED AWAY WITH HIS GOOD HORSES LEAVING THEIR JADED ONES
8388-278289-0015 THE POOR FELLOW REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS AND MANAGED BY MORNING TO CRAWL SIX MILES TO A RANCH RESOLUTE MEN HURRIEDLY SADDLED THEIR HORSES AND SOON THIRTY WERE AFTER THE OUTLAWS I HEAR GRISWOLD IS WITH THEM HE HAVING RECOVERED
8388-278289-0016 THEY FELT PRETTY NEAR THE GAME MISTER GREEN GAVE ME A SECOND HANDED DESCRIPTION OF THE DESPERADOES AND THEIR OUTFIT AND DIRECTING ME ON MY ROUTE WISHED US GODSPEED
8388-278289-0017 I FELT THAT MY ROUTE FORCED ME TO OVERTAKE RATHER THAN TO MEET BY CHANCE TWO MEN WHO SET BUT LITTLE VALUE ON OTHER MEN'S LIVES AND EVEN LESS ON THEIR OWN
8388-278289-0018 WE SOON ARRIVED AT EGAN WHERE WE WERE KINDLY RECEIVED THE MEN SHOWED US ABOUT THE WORKS ALLOWING ME TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS
8388-278289-0019 AT THREE POINTS ONLY SHOULD WE FIND WATER AT NINE MILE SPRING THIRTY MILE AND PINTO CREEK THE LATTER BEING SEVENTY MILES AWAY NO HABITATION WOULD WE SEE ONLY AN OCCASIONAL COYOTE OR A BAND OF WILD HORSES OR POSSIBLY SOME PRAIRIE SCHOONER
8388-278289-0020 WERE CLIMBING HIGHER AND HIGHER THE RUGGED PLATEAU UNTIL WE REACHED NINE MILE AND UNPACKED THE SPRING WAS IN A GRASSY SPOT AND COONSKIN FIRST REPLENISHED OUR CANTEENS THEN RELEASED THE DONKEYS IT WAS NOON ACCUSTOMED AS WE WERE TO TRAVEL ON TWO MEALS A DAY
8388-278289-0021 THE DESPERADOES FORMED THE CHIEF TOPIC OF DISCUSSION EVEN DON SHOWED THE BLOODHOUND IN HIM AND EVER SINCE LEAVING EGAN SHOWED UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT AND WAS MORE VIGILANT
8388-278289-0022 TAKING EVERYTHING INTO CONSIDERATION WE WERE IN A FAIR MOOD TO BE STARTLED WHEN THE DOG SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND GROWLED THEN THREE MEN HEAVILY ARMED GALLOPED UP AND DISMOUNTED I WAS RELIEVED WHEN I SAW ONE OF THE RIDERS WEARING A BANDAGE ROUND HIS HEAD IT MUST BE GRISWOLD
8388-278289-0023 THE STRANGERS LEFT THEIR STEEDS STANDING EACH TYING A REIN TO A STIRRUP THEN INTRODUCED THEMSELVES
8388-278289-0024 BUT NOW COONSKIN COOKED FOR OUR FRIENDS WHILE I DID ALL THE HONORS AND GLEANED ALL THE INFORMATION ESSENTIAL TO OUR INTERESTS
8388-278289-0025 BUT HAD SET OUT HARDLY EQUIPPED FOR THE CHASE ONE PICKED UP A TWO QUART CANTEEN SAYING GOOD NATUREDLY THAT HE RECKONED HE WOULD HAVE TO RUSTLE IT
8388-278289-0026 BEFORE SEPARATING ON OUR SEVERAL MISSIONS COONSKIN PHOTOGRAPHED THE PARTY AND GRISWOLD REPEATED HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE OUTLAWS
8388-278289-0027 BEFORE LEAVING THEY ASKED ME IF I WOULD BLAZE A SAGE BRUSH FIRE THAT NIGHT SHOULD I REACH THIRTY MILE AND DISCOVER ANY EVIDENCE OF THE BANDITS THEY ALSO ADMONISHED ME TO HOLD UP AND SHOOT WITHOUT CONSIDERING AN INSTANT ANY TWO MOUNTED MEN OF THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN ELSE WE TWO WOULD NEVER LIVE TO TELL HOW IT HAPPENED
8388-278289-0028 WITH THIS PARTING INJUNCTION UNOFFICIAL THOUGH IT WAS THE RIDERS LOPED AWAY AND MY NERVOUS TROOP AT HALF PAST TWO HIT THE TRAIL IN LIVELY FORM I WAS GLAD THE COUNTRY WAS CLEAR AND OPEN ONLY AN OCCASIONAL DWARF CEDAR STOOD IN DARK RELIEF AGAINST THE SAGE
8388-278289-0029 AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE CLOUDS WHICH HAD GATHERED THE DARKNESS WAS DENSE I FELT WE MUST BE NEAR TO THIRTY MILE THE IDEA OF PASSING THE SPRING AND HAVING TO TRACE OUR STEPS NEXT MORNING WAS NOT TO BE ENTERTAINED SEEING A BUNCH OF CEDARS SOME DISTANCE TO THE RIGHT I HEADED FOR THEM
8388-278289-0030 AND THERE WE CAMPED BEHIND THE SCREEN OF THREE SMALL TREES AND THE DARKNESS WE SPREAD OUR BLANKETS LUNCHED ON BREAD AND COLD MEAT AND WENT TO SLEEP THE DONKEYS WERE PICKETED STILL ANOTHER HUNDRED YARDS BACK SO AS NOT TO BE SEEN FROM THE TRAIL WE DID NOT LIGHT A FIRE
8388-278289-0031 BY TEN O'CLOCK NEXT MORNING WE HAD BREAKFASTED AND WERE TRAILING TOWARD THE SUMMIT OF THE PLATEAU THREE MILES FURTHER ON WAS THIRTY MILE HERE AGAIN I UNPACKED THE ANIMALS FOR AN HOUR'S GRAZING ON THE GRASS BY THE SPRING THE NOON HOUR FOUND US WEARY TRAVELERS RECLINING ON A HEAP OF BLANKETS
8388-278289-0032 TO THE EAST SOME FIFTY FEET AWAY STOOD A TUB OBSCURED BY PUSSY WILLOWS AND BRIMMING WITH COOL WATER FURNISHED BY A CEDAR TROUGH WHICH REACHED FROM THE BUBBLING SPRING THE OVERFLOW STREAMED DOWN A TINY GORGE IN THE HARD SOIL UNDER COVER OF THE WILLOWS AND FINALLY SANK IN THE EARTH
8388-278289-0033 SAID COONSKIN DISAPPOINTEDLY AT LENGTH I'D GIVE A FARM TO GET A WHACK AT THEM HE HAD NO SOONER UTTERED THE WORDS THAN HE TURNED PALE AND I TURNED TO BEHOLD TWO SMALL MOVING DOTS ON THE HORIZON SOME TWO MILES DOWN THE TRAIL
8388-278289-0034 JOVE HE ADDED I BELIEVE THE OUTLAWS ARE COMING
8388-278289-0035 ASSIGNING TO MY VALET THE SHOT GUN AND THE SMITH AND WESSON DOUBLE ACTION REVOLVER I LOADED TWO EXTRA SHELLS WITH BUCKSHOT TESTED THE LOCKS OF MY WINCHESTER AND SINGLE ACTION COLT REVOLVER GAVE COONSKIN EXPLICIT INSTRUCTIONS AND AWAITED EVENTS
8388-278289-0036 WHEN THE STRANGE RIDERS RODE TO WITHIN A HALF MILE OF US THEY STOPPED AND DISMOUNTED IT WAS PLAIN THEY WERE CINCHING THEIR SADDLES PROBABLY PREPARING TO DO SOME ROUGH RIDING
8388-278289-0037 BUT I WAS CAUTIONED THAT THEY MIGHT EXCHANGE A HORSE FOR ONE ON THE RANGE IN ORDER TO MISLEAD THEIR PURSUERS THEY AND THEIR OUTFIT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS TALLIED WITH THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN TO ME
8388-278289-0038 HE PROTESTED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER NOT TO ATTEMPT TO HOLD UP THE FELLOWS UNTIL WE WERE SURE WE WERE RIGHT
8388-278289-0039 AND STATIONING HIMSELF SOME TEN FEET BEFORE US WATCHED THE STRANGERS EAGERLY I ASSURED COONSKIN THAT IF OUR DOG ALLOWED THOSE HORSEMEN TO ENTER CAMP WE COULD REST EASY
8388-278289-0040 DON'T LET THEM CORRAL US I CAUTIONED IF THEY GET US BETWEEN THEM THE GAME IS UP THOSE WERE ANXIOUS MOMENTS FOR ME AS WELL AS FOR THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS TEN YEARS MY JUNIOR I WAS SEATED ON OUR PACKS MY WINCHESTER LYING ACROSS MY KNEES COCKED
8388-278289-0041 COONSKIN SAT ON THE GROUND AT MY RIGHT WITH SHOT GUN IN HAND OUR REVOLVERS WERE IN OUR BELTS OUR BEARDED AND SUN BURNED FACES LONG HAIR AND GENERALLY ROUGH ATTIRE ADDED TO OUR UNFRIENDLY ATTITUDE MUST HAVE PUZZLED THE APPROACHING HORSEMEN
8388-278289-0042 WHEN THEY HAD COME TO A HUNDRED FEET FROM US I CALLED ROUGHLY HELLOA BOYS COME IN YOU'RE JUST IN TIME FOR GRUB
8388-278289-0043 HE IDENTIFIED THE DESPERADOES INSTANTLY REINING THEIR STEEDS ONE OF THEM SLUNG SOME SIMPLE QUESTIONS AT ME DESIGNED NO DOUBT TO THROW US OFF GUARD PURTY NICE LOT OF BURROS YOU'VE GOT HE BEGAN PRETTY FAIR I REPLIED DISINTERESTEDLY
8388-278289-0044 I DID NOT ANSWER THEN THE MAN ASKED HOW FAR IS IT I DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T CARE A D
8388-278289-0045 SHALL WE GO IN AND COOK NO BETTER WATER OUR HORSES AND GO ON SAID THE PARTNER
8388-278289-0046 THE OTHER GUIDED HIS HORSE TO OUR LEFT TO HEM COONSKIN AND ME IN BETWEEN THEM INSTANTLY I ROSE TO MY FEET AND TRAILING THE RIFLE OVER MY WRIST STRODE EYEING HIM DEFIANTLY IN A LINE AT A RIGHT ANGLE WITH THE COURSE OF HIS HORSE
8388-278289-0047 BUT THE ROGUE DID NOT GO FAR BEFORE TURNING HIS STEED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TUB THERE BOTH MEN DISMOUNTED BEHIND THEIR STEEDS TOOK OFF THE BRIDLES WITH SPADE BITS THAT THEIR HORSES MIGHT DRINK
8388-278289-0048 NOT EXACTLY I SAID WITH A FAINT SMILE DON'T THINK I EVER SAW THREE ARMED MEN I WAITED A FEW SECONDS FOR MY LEVITY TO PRODUCE THE DESIRED EFFECT THEN ADDED
8388-278289-0049 THERE WERE THREE DETERMINED LOOKING FELLOWS ARMED WITH DOUBLE BARRELED SHOT GUNS WHO STOPPED HERE THEY WERE MAN HUNTING
8388-278289-0050 HOW LONG AGO WERE THEY HERE WHERE'D THEY GO OH JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO THEY TOOK IN A FEW CANS OF WATER I HERE POINTED IN THEIR DIRECTION AND SAID THEY WERE GOING TO COOK OVER THERE BEHIND THAT KNOLL
8388-278289-0051 BUT SANCHO NEVER BUDGED HIS COURAGE HAD LEFT HIM THE OUTLAWS TURNED THEIR EYES UPON US SO QUICKLY I THINK THEY MUST HAVE OVERHEARD MY WHISPERED COMMAND THEY HASTILY BRIDLED MOUNTED AND RODE SOUTHWESTERLY IN THE DIRECTION WE WERE BOUND
8388-278289-0052 I WAS IN THE MOOD TO JUMP COONSKIN FOR NOT AIDING ME TO HOLD UP THE OUTLAWS
8388-278289-0053 AND MARCHED THEM HANDCUFFED INTO ELY THE COUNTY SEAT AND THINK OF THE HANDSOME REWARD I SAID
8388-278289-0054 UNLESS IT SHOULD BE SOLICITED BY ME AND FURTHERMORE I DID NOT WISH TO HEAR ANY EXPRESSIONS OF DESIRE TO ATTACK ANYTHING MORE FORMIDABLE THAN A JACK RABBIT
8388-278289-0055 AND MY CARAVAN WAS ON THE MOVE AGAIN ABOUT MIDNIGHT WE MADE A DRY CAMP AT A DISCREET DISTANCE FROM THE TRAIL WHERE WITHOUT BUILDING A FIRE WE MADE A COLD LUNCH SERVE FOR OUR SECOND MEAL THAT DAY AND RETIRED NEXT MORNING EARLY WE RESUMED THE JOURNEY
8388-278289-0056 BY TWO O'CLOCK WE HAD CROSSED THE LONG VALLEY MOUNTAINS AND WERE ON THE MARGIN OF A SAGE COVERED PLAIN STILL PROBABLY TWENTY MILES TO PINTO SEVERAL TIMES WE WERE PUZZLED BY FORKING TRAILS AND WERE IN DOUBT WHETHER WE WERE ON THE RIGHT ONE TO EUREKA
8388-278289-0057 I JUDGED THE VALLEY TO BE TEN MILES WIDE ON WE RODE THE PLUCKY ANIMALS SWINGING SLOWLY ALONG IN THAT AWKWARD YET AMUSING HIP MOVEMENT CHARACTERISTIC OF THE BURRO UNTIL I DISTINGUISHED ACROSS THE PLAIN WHAT LOOKED TO BE A HOUSE I DECIDED TO HEAD FOR IT
8388-278289-0058 WE ARRIVED THERE AT FIVE O'CLOCK TO FIND THE PLACE TEMPORARILY DESERTED TO DISCOVER A FINE SPRING AND PLENTY OF HAY HERE WE COOKED OUR EVENING MEAL AND WERE ENJOYING A SMOKE WHEN TWO MEN RODE UP WITH AN AIR OF CONSCIOUS PROPRIETORSHIP
8388-278289-0059 THEY WERE MISTER ROBINSON PROPRIETOR OF NEWARK MINES AND HIS SUPERINTENDENT BOTH WERE VERY HOSPITABLE MISTER ROBINSON INVITED ME TO HELP MYSELF TO ANYTHING I OR MY PARTY NEEDED REGRETTED THAT WE HAD NOT WAITED TO DINE WITH HIM AND ASKED US TO SPEND THE EVENING AT HIS HOUSE AND BREAKFAST WITH HIM
8388-278289-0060 WE WERE TREATED TO A HEAPING PLATE OF DELICIOUS APPLES AND IT WAS A LATE HOUR BEFORE WE SOUGHT OUR TENTS IT WAS A RELIEF TO FEEL MYSELF WELL BEYOND THE OUTLAWS DOMAIN NEXT DAY MY GOOD HOST DIRECTED HIS SUPERINTENDENT TO GUIDE US OVER CHIHUAHUA PASS
8388-278289-0061 WHICH WOULD SAVE US A FIFTEEN MILE JOURNEY AROUND THE EXTREMITY OF THE MOUNTAIN BY WAY OF PINTO THE CLIMB OVER THE PASS WAS RICH WITH BEAUTIFUL VIEWS AFTER RISING SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET AND LOOKING BACK THE VISTA BETWEEN THE SUMMITS AND THE PLAINS GLISTENING IN THE SUN WAS SUPERB
8388-278289-0062 THE MINES WERE A MILE OR TWO UP THE CANYON AND TO THIS POINT MY KIND HOST ACCOMPANIED US AFTER WHICH HIS MAN ON HORSEBACK LED US OVER THE ROUGHEST AND MOST PUZZLING PART OF THE TRAIL
