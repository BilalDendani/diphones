8447-286248-0000 AN INSURANCE ACT
8447-286248-0001 BUT IN MY OWN CASE I HAD EXPECTED THE THING TO BE THE MEREST FORMALITY THE DOCTOR HAVING SEEN AT A GLANCE WHAT A FINE STRONG HEALTHY FELLOW I WAS
8447-286248-0002 ENQUIRE GENIALLY WHAT MY GRANDFATHER HAD DIED OF AND SHOW ME TO THE DOOR THIS IDEA OF MINE WAS FOSTERED BY THE EXCELLENT TESTIMONIAL WHICH I HAD WRITTEN MYSELF AT THE COMPANY'S BIDDING

8447-286248-0004 MY REPLIES HAD BEEN A MODEL OF WHAT AN ASSURANCE COMPANY EXPECTS THEN WHY THE NEED OF A DOCTOR
8447-286248-0005 THEY INSISTED THE DOCTOR BEGAN QUIETLY ENOUGH HE ASKED AS I HAD ANTICIPATED AFTER THE HEALTH OF MY RELATIONS
8447-286248-0006 WITH AN APOLOGETIC SMILE AND LOOKED ROUND FOR THE SIDEBOARD UNFORTUNATELY HE DID NOT PURSUE THE MATTER AND NOW HE SAID AFTER THE HUNDREDTH QUESTION

8447-286248-0008 IT WAS NO GOOD HE WAS EVIDENTLY DETERMINED TO SEE MY CHEST
8447-286248-0009 FOR THE MOST PART ONE DOUBLE KNOCK AT ANY POINT APPEARED TO SATISFY HIM BUT OCCASIONALLY THERE WOULD BE NO ANSWER AND HE WOULD KNOCK AGAIN AT ONE SPOT HE KNOCKED FOUR TIMES BEFORE HE COULD MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
8447-286248-0010 HAS TORN IT I SHALL BE PLOUGHED AND I SENT AN URGENT MESSAGE TO MY CHEST
8447-286248-0011 FOR AT THE NEXT KNOCK HE PASSED ON TO AN ADJACENT SPOT
8447-286248-0012 I DON'T BELIEVE HE LIKES MY CHEST WITHOUT A WORD HE GOT OUT HIS STETHOSCOPE AND BEGAN TO LISTEN TO ME AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT HE STRUCK SOMETHING INTERESTING ALMOST AT ONCE
8447-286248-0013 AND FOR WHAT SEEMED HOURS
