1734-142311-0000 A SPADE A RAKE A HOE A PICKAXE OR A BILL A HOOK TO REAP OR A SCYTHE TO MOW A FLAIL OR WHAT YE WILL AND HERE'S A READY HAND TO PLY THE NEEDFUL TOOL AND SKILL'D ENOUGH BY LESSONS ROUGH IN LABOUR'S RUGGED SCHOOL
1734-142311-0001 HIGGINS'S DOOR WAS LOCKED THE NEXT DAY WHEN THEY WENT TO PAY THEIR CALL ON THE WIDOW BOUCHER BUT THEY LEARNT THIS TIME FROM AN OFFICIOUS NEIGHBOUR
1734-142311-0002 HE HAD HOWEVER BEEN IN TO SEE MISSUS BOUCHER BEFORE STARTING ON HIS DAY'S BUSINESS WHATEVER THAT WAS IT WAS BUT AN UNSATISFACTORY VISIT TO MISSUS BOUCHER SHE CONSIDERED HERSELF AS AN ILL USED WOMAN BY HER POOR HUSBAND'S SUICIDE
1734-142311-0003 AND THERE WAS QUITE GERM OF TRUTH ENOUGH IN THIS IDEA TO MAKE IT A VERY DIFFICULT ONE TO REFUTE STILL IT WAS UNSATISFACTORY TO SEE HOW COMPLETELY HER THOUGHTS WERE TURNED UPON HERSELF AND HER OWN POSITION
1734-142311-0004 AND THIS SELFISHNESS EXTENDED EVEN TO HER RELATIONS WITH HER CHILDREN WHOM SHE CONSIDERED AS INCUMBRANCES EVEN IN THE VERY MIDST OF HER SOMEWHAT ANIMAL AFFECTION FOR THEM
1734-142311-0005 SHE FOUND THAT THE CHILDREN WERE TRUER AND SIMPLER MOURNERS THAN THE WIDOW DADDY HAD BEEN A KIND DADDY TO THEM EACH COULD TELL IN THEIR EAGER STAMMERING WAY OF SOME TENDERNESS SHOWN SOME INDULGENCE GRANTED BY THE LOST FATHER
1734-142311-0006 IS YON THING UPSTAIRS REALLY HIM IT DOESNA LOOK LIKE HIM
1734-142311-0007 MARGARET'S HEART BLED TO HEAR THAT THE MOTHER IN HER SELFISH REQUIREMENT OF SYMPATHY HAD TAKEN HER CHILDREN UPSTAIRS TO SEE THEIR DISFIGURED FATHER IT WAS INTERMINGLING THE COARSENESS OF HORROR WITH THE PROFOUNDNESS OF NATURAL GRIEF SHE TRIED TO TURN THEIR THOUGHTS IN SOME OTHER DIRECTION
1734-142311-0008 WHAT FATHER WOULD HAVE WISHED THEM TO DO MARGARET WAS MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN MISTER HALE IN HER EFFORTS THE CHILDREN SEEING THEIR LITTLE DUTIES LIE IN ACTION CLOSE AROUND THEM
1734-142311-0009 BEGAN TO TRY EACH ONE TO DO SOMETHING THAT SHE SUGGESTED TOWARDS REDDING UP THE SLATTERNLY ROOM BUT HER FATHER SET TOO HIGH A STANDARD AND TOO ABSTRACT A VIEW BEFORE THE INDOLENT INVALID
1734-142311-0010 SHE COULD ONLY LOOK UPON IT AS IT AFFECTED HERSELF SHE COULD NOT ENTER INTO THE ENDURING MERCY OF THE GOD WHO HAD NOT SPECIALLY INTERPOSED TO PREVENT THE WATER FROM DROWNING HER PROSTRATE HUSBAND AND ALTHOUGH SHE WAS SECRETLY BLAMING HER HUSBAND FOR HAVING FALLEN INTO SUCH DREAR DESPAIR
1734-142311-0011 SHE WAS INVETERATE IN HER ABUSE OF ALL WHO COULD BY ANY POSSIBILITY BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE DRIVEN HIM TO SUCH DESPERATION THE MASTERS
1734-142311-0012 MISTER THORNTON IN PARTICULAR WHOSE MILL HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY BOUCHER AND WHO AFTER THE WARRANT HAD BEEN ISSUED FOR HIS APPREHENSION ON THE CHARGE OF RIOTING HAD CAUSED IT TO BE WITHDRAWN THE UNION OF WHICH HIGGINS WAS THE REPRESENTATIVE TO THE POOR WOMAN
1734-142311-0013 THE CHILDREN SO NUMEROUS SO HUNGRY AND SO NOISY ALL MADE UP ONE GREAT ARMY OF PERSONAL ENEMIES WHOSE FAULT IT WAS THAT SHE WAS NOW A HELPLESS WIDOW MARGARET HEARD ENOUGH OF THIS UNREASONABLENESS TO DISHEARTEN HER
1734-142311-0014 AND WHEN THEY CAME AWAY SHE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CHEER HER FATHER IT IS THE TOWN LIFE SAID SHE THEIR NERVES ARE QUICKENED BY THE HASTE AND BUSTLE AND SPEED OF EVERYTHING AROUND THEM TO SAY NOTHING OF THE CONFINEMENT IN THESE PENT UP HOUSES
1734-142311-0015 WHICH OF ITSELF IS ENOUGH TO INDUCE DEPRESSION AND WORRY OF SPIRITS NOW IN THE COUNTRY PEOPLE LIVE SO MUCH MORE OUT OF DOORS EVEN CHILDREN AND EVEN IN THE WINTER BUT PEOPLE MUST LIVE IN TOWNS
1734-142311-0016 AND IN THE COUNTRY SOME GET SUCH STAGNANT HABITS OF MIND THAT THEY ARE ALMOST FATALISTS YES I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I SUPPOSE EACH MODE OF LIFE PRODUCES ITS OWN TRIALS AND ITS OWN TEMPTATIONS
1734-142311-0017 AS THE COUNTRY BRED MAN MUST FIND IT TO BE ACTIVE AND EQUAL TO UNWONTED EMERGENCIES BOTH MUST FIND IT HARD TO REALISE A FUTURE OF ANY KIND THE ONE BECAUSE THE PRESENT IS SO LIVING AND HURRYING AND CLOSE AROUND HIM
1734-142311-0018 THE OTHER BECAUSE HIS LIFE TEMPTS HIM TO REVEL IN THE MERE SENSE OF ANIMAL EXISTENCE NOT KNOWING OF AND CONSEQUENTLY NOT CARING FOR ANY PUNGENCY OF PLEASURE FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF WHICH HE CAN PLAN AND DENY HIMSELF AND LOOK FORWARD
1734-142311-0019 AND THUS BOTH THE NECESSITY FOR ENGROSSMENT AND THE STUPID CONTENT IN THE PRESENT PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECTS BUT THIS POOR MISSUS BOUCHER HOW LITTLE WE CAN DO FOR HER
1734-142311-0020 AND YET WE DARE NOT LEAVE HER WITHOUT OUR EFFORTS ALTHOUGH THEY MAY SEEM SO USELESS OH PAPA
1734-142311-0021 SO IT IS MY CHILD WE FEEL IT SO JUST NOW AT ANY RATE BUT WE HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY EVEN IN THE MIDST OF OUR SORROW WHAT A PLEASURE FREDERICK'S VISIT WAS YES THAT IT WAS SAID MARGARET BRIGHTLY IT WAS SUCH A CHARMING SNATCHED FORBIDDEN THING
1734-142311-0022 OF ALL FAULTS THE ONE SHE MOST DESPISED IN OTHERS WAS THE WANT OF BRAVERY THE MEANNESS OF HEART WHICH LEADS TO UNTRUTH
1734-142311-0023 THEN CAME THE THOUGHT OF MISTER THORNTON'S COGNISANCE OF HER FALSEHOOD SHE WONDERED IF SHE SHOULD HAVE MINDED DETECTION HALF SO MUCH FROM ANY ONE ELSE SHE TRIED HERSELF IN IMAGINATION WITH HER AUNT SHAW AND EDITH WITH HER FATHER
1734-142311-0024 WITH CAPTAIN AND MISTER LENNOX WITH FREDERICK THE THOUGHT OF THE LAST KNOWING WHAT SHE HAD DONE EVEN IN HIS OWN BEHALF WAS THE MOST PAINFUL FOR THE BROTHER AND SISTER WERE IN THE FIRST FLUSH OF THEIR MUTUAL REGARD AND LOVE
1734-142311-0025 SHE FELT AT THE THOUGHT OF MEETING MISTER THORNTON AGAIN AND YET SHE LONGED TO SEE HIM TO GET IT OVER TO UNDERSTAND WHERE SHE STOOD IN HIS OPINION HER CHEEKS BURNT AS SHE RECOLLECTED HOW PROUDLY SHE HAD IMPLIED AN OBJECTION TO TRADE
1734-142311-0026 IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE BECAUSE IT TOO OFTEN LED TO THE DECEIT OF PASSING OFF INFERIOR FOR SUPERIOR GOODS IN THE ONE BRANCH OF ASSUMING CREDIT FOR WEALTH AND RESOURCES NOT POSSESSED IN THE OTHER SHE REMEMBERED MISTER THORNTON'S LOOK OF CALM DISDAIN
1734-142311-0027 AS IN FEW WORDS HE GAVE HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE GREAT SCHEME OF COMMERCE ALL DISHONOURABLE WAYS OF ACTING WERE SURE TO PROVE INJURIOUS IN THE LONG RUN AND THAT TESTING SUCH ACTIONS SIMPLY ACCORDING TO THE POOR STANDARD OF SUCCESS
1734-142311-0028 THERE WAS FOLLY AND NOT WISDOM IN ALL SUCH AND EVERY KIND OF DECEIT IN TRADE AS WELL AS IN OTHER THINGS SHE REMEMBERED SHE THEN STRONG IN HER OWN UNTEMPTED TRUTH ASKING HIM
1734-142311-0029 IF HE DID NOT THINK THAT BUYING IN THE CHEAPEST AND SELLING IN THE DEAREST MARKET PROVED SOME WANT OF THE TRANSPARENT JUSTICE WHICH IS SO INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH THE IDEA OF TRUTH AND SHE HAD USED THE WORD CHIVALRIC
1734-142311-0030 AND HER FATHER HAD CORRECTED HER WITH THE HIGHER WORD CHRISTIAN AND SO DRAWN THE ARGUMENT UPON HIMSELF WHILE SHE SATE SILENT BY WITH A SLIGHT FEELING OF CONTEMPT NO MORE CONTEMPT FOR HER NO
1734-142311-0031 HENCEFORWARD SHE MUST FEEL HUMILIATED AND DISGRACED IN HIS SIGHT BUT WHEN SHOULD SHE SEE HIM HER HEART LEAPED UP IN APPREHENSION AT EVERY RING OF THE DOOR BELL
1734-142311-0032 AND WAS SURPRISED THAT HE DID NOT COME THE TRUTH WAS THAT THERE WERE POINTS IN THEIR CONVERSATION THE OTHER NIGHT ON WHICH THEY HAD NO TIME THEN TO ENLARGE BUT IT HAD BEEN UNDERSTOOD THAT IF POSSIBLE ON THE SUCCEEDING EVENING
1734-142311-0033 IF NOT THEN AT LEAST THE VERY FIRST EVENING THAT MISTER THORNTON COULD COMMAND THEY SHOULD MEET FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION MISTER HALE HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS MEETING EVER SINCE THEY HAD PARTED
1734-142311-0034 HE HAD NOT YET RESUMED THE INSTRUCTION TO HIS PUPILS WHICH HE HAD RELINQUISHED AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF HIS WIFE'S MORE SERIOUS ILLNESS SO HE HAD FEWER OCCUPATIONS THAN USUAL AND THE GREAT INTEREST OF THE LAST DAY OR SO BOUCHER'S SUICIDE
1734-142311-0035 HAD DRIVEN HIM BACK WITH MORE EAGERNESS THAN EVER UPON HIS SPECULATIONS HE WAS RESTLESS ALL EVENING HE KEPT SAYING I QUITE EXPECTED TO HAVE SEEN MISTER THORNTON I THINK THE MESSENGER WHO BROUGHT THE BOOK LAST NIGHT MUST HAVE HAD SOME NOTE AND FORGOT TO DELIVER IT
1734-142311-0036 I WILL GO AND INQUIRE PAPA SAID MARGARET AFTER THE CHANGES ON THESE SENTENCES HAD BEEN RUNG ONCE OR TWICE STAY THERE'S A RING SHE SATE DOWN INSTANTLY AND BENT HER HEAD ATTENTIVELY OVER HER WORK SHE HEARD A STEP ON THE STAIRS
1734-142311-0037 SHE LIFTED UP HER HEAD AND SIGHED AND BELIEVED SHE FELT GLAD IT'S THAT HIGGINS SIR HE WANTS TO SEE YOU OR ELSE MISS HALE
1734-142311-0038 OH VERY WELL SIR I'VE NO WISH TO HEAR WHAT HE'S GOT TO SAY I'M SURE ONLY IF YOU COULD SEE HIS SHOES I'M SURE YOU'D SAY THE KITCHEN WAS THE FITTER PLACE HE CAN WIPE THEM I SUPPOSE SAID MISTER HALE SO DIXON FLUNG OFF TO BID HIM WALK UP STAIRS
1734-142311-0039 SHE WAS A LITTLE MOLLIFIED HOWEVER WHEN HE LOOKED AT HIS FEET WITH A HESITATING AIR AND THEN SITTING DOWN ON THE BOTTOM STAIR HE TOOK OFF THE OFFENDING SHOES AND WITHOUT A WORD WALKED UP STAIRS SARVANT SIR SAID HE SLICKING HIS HAIR DOWN WHEN HE CAME INTO THE ROOM
1734-142311-0040 MARGARET THOUGHT THAT FATIGUE MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE IN HIS MANNER FOR HE WAS UNUSUALLY QUIET AND SUBDUED AND HE HAD EVIDENTLY SOME DIFFICULTY IN SAYING WHAT HE CAME TO SAY MISTER HALE'S EVER READY SYMPATHY WITH ANYTHING OF SHYNESS OR HESITATION
1734-142311-0041 OR WANT OF SELF POSSESSION MADE HIM COME TO HIS AID
1734-142311-0042 I AM SURE YOU ARE TIRED IF YOU'VE BEEN OUT MUCH THIS WET RELAXING DAY MARGARET MY DEAR CAN'T YOU HASTEN TEA
1734-142311-0043 EVEN DIXON HERSELF IN THE LONG RUN FELT IT A PLEASURE AND AN HONOUR TO FORWARD ANY OF HER WISHES AND HER READINESS AND MARGARET'S SWEET FORBEARANCE SOON MADE DIXON ASHAMED OF HERSELF
1734-142311-0044 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND FOLK AT HELSTONE WERE NEVER BROUGHT HIGHER THAN THE KITCHEN
1734-142311-0045 WHAT DO YOU MEAN TELL ME OUT I HAVE TELLED YO SAID HIGGINS A LITTLE SURPRISED AT MISTER HALE'S AGITATION
1734-142311-0046 MISTER HALE GOT HOLD OF HIGGINS'S HAND AND SHOOK IT HEARTILY WITHOUT SPEAKING HIGGINS LOOKED AWKWARD AND ASHAMED
1734-142311-0047 FOR ALL I TELLED HAMPER THAT LET ALONE HIS PLEDGE WHICH I WOULD NOT SIGN NO I COULD NA NOT E E N FOR THIS
1734-142311-0048 I'M A POOR BLACK FECKLESS SHEEP CHILDER MAY CLEM FOR AUGHT I CAN DO UNLESS PARSON YO'D HELP ME HELP YOU HOW I WOULD DO ANYTHING BUT WHAT CAN I DO
1734-142311-0049 FOR MARGARET HAD RE ENTERED THE ROOM AND STOOD SILENT LISTENING
1734-142311-0050 NOW I DUNNOT KNOW HOW FAR OFF IT IS
1734-142311-0051 WHERE FOOD IS CHEAP AND WAGES GOOD AND ALL THE FOLK RICH AND POOR MASTER AND MAN FRIENDLY LIKE YO COULD MAY BE HELP ME TO WORK
1734-142311-0052 IN ME MEASTER BUT WHAT KIND OF WORK COULD YOU DO MY MAN
1734-142311-0053 AND FOR THAT SAID MARGARET STEPPING FORWARDS FOR ANYTHING YOU COULD DO HIGGINS WITH THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD YOU WOULD
1734-142311-0054 FOOD IS MUCH THE SAME AS HERE EXCEPT THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE GARDEN THE CHILDER COULD WORK AT THAT SAID HE
1734-142311-0055 YOU MUST NOT GO TO THE SOUTH SAID MARGARET FOR ALL THAT YOU COULD NOT STAND IT

1734-142311-0058 TO PUT IT ALL CLEAR BEFORE YOU YOU WOULD NOT BEAR THE DULNESS OF THE LIFE
1734-142311-0059 THEY LABOUR ON FROM DAY TO DAY IN THE GREAT SOLITUDE OF STEAMING FIELDS NEVER SPEAKING OR LIFTING UP THEIR POOR BENT DOWNCAST HEADS
1734-142311-0060 THE SAMENESS OF THEIR TOIL DEADENS THEIR IMAGINATION THEY DON'T CARE TO MEET TO TALK OVER THOUGHTS AND SPECULATIONS EVEN OF THE WEAKEST WILDEST KIND AFTER THEIR WORK IS DONE THEY GO HOME BRUTISHLY TIRED POOR CREATURES
1734-142311-0061 CARING FOR NOTHING BUT FOOD AND REST YOU COULD NOT STIR THEM UP INTO ANY COMPANIONSHIP
1734-142311-0062 WHETHER IT BE GOOD OR BAD AND THAT I DON'T KNOW BUT I DO KNOW THAT YOU OF ALL MEN ARE NOT ONE TO BEAR A LIFE AMONG SUCH LABOURERS WHAT WOULD BE PEACE TO THEM WOULD BE ETERNAL FRETTING TO YOU THINK NO MORE OF IT NICHOLAS I BEG

1734-142311-0066 IT NEEDS FETTLING AND WHO'S TO FETTLE IT IF IT'S AS YON FOLKS SAY AND THERE'S NOUGHT BUT WHAT WE SEE MISTER HALE WAS BUSY CUTTING BREAD AND BUTTER MARGARET WAS GLAD OF THIS FOR SHE SAW THAT HIGGINS WAS BETTER LEFT TO HIMSELF
1734-142311-0067 THAT IF HER FATHER BEGAN TO SPEAK EVER SO MILDLY ON THE SUBJECT OF HIGGINS'S THOUGHTS THE LATTER WOULD CONSIDER HIMSELF CHALLENGED TO AN ARGUMENT AND WOULD FEEL HIMSELF BOUND TO MAINTAIN HIS OWN GROUND
1734-142311-0068 SHE AND HER FATHER KEPT UP AN INDIFFERENT CONVERSATION UNTIL HIGGINS SCARCELY AWARE WHETHER HE ATE OR NOT HAD MADE A VERY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL THEN HE PUSHED HIS CHAIR AWAY FROM THE TABLE AND TRIED TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN WHAT THEY WERE SAYING
1734-142311-0069 BUT IT WAS OF NO USE AND HE FELL BACK INTO DREAMY GLOOM SUDDENLY MARGARET SAID SHE HAD BEEN THINKING OF IT FOR SOME TIME BUT THE WORDS HAD STUCK IN HER THROAT HIGGINS HAVE YOU BEEN TO MARLBOROUGH MILLS TO SEEK FOR WORK
1734-142311-0070 THORNTON'S ASKED HE AY I'VE BEEN AT THORNTON'S AND WHAT DID HE SAY SUCH A CHAP AS ME IS NOT LIKE TO SEE THE MEASTER
1734-142311-0071 I WISH YOU HAD SEEN MISTER THORNTON SAID MISTER HALE HE MIGHT NOT HAVE GIVEN YOU WORK BUT HE WOULD NOT HAVE USED SUCH LANGUAGE

1734-142311-0073 I SHOULD BE SO GLAD IF YOU WOULD I'M AFRAID IT WOULD BE OF NO USE SAID MISTER HALE IN A LOW VOICE IT WOULD BE BETTER TO LET ME SPEAK TO HIM MARGARET STILL LOOKED AT HIGGINS FOR HIS ANSWER
1734-142311-0074 BUT YO'RE NOT A COMMON WENCH AXING YO'R PARDON NOR YET HAVE YO COMMON WAYS ABOUT YO I'LL E'EN MAKE A WRY FACE AND GO AT IT TO MORROW DUNNA YO THINK THAT HE'LL DO IT

1734-142311-0077 I DUNNOT STOMACH THE NOTION OF HAVING FAVOUR CURRIED FOR ME BY ONE AS DOESN'T KNOW THE INS AND OUTS OF THE QUARREL

1734-142311-0080 I TOOK THEM THERE TO DRY SAID MARGARET HE TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT HER STEADILY AND THEN HE BRUSHED HIS LEAN HAND ACROSS HIS EYES AND WENT HIS WAY
1734-142311-0081 HOW PROUD THAT MAN IS SAID HER FATHER WHO WAS A LITTLE ANNOYED AT THE MANNER IN WHICH HIGGINS HAD DECLINED HIS INTERCESSION WITH MISTER THORNTON HE IS SAID MARGARET BUT WHAT GRAND MAKINGS OF A MAN THERE ARE IN HIM PRIDE AND ALL
1734-142311-0082 THERE'S GRANITE IN ALL THESE NORTHERN PEOPLE PAPA IS THERE NOT
1734-142311-0083 I SHOULD GUESS FROM THEIR TONES THAT THEY HAD IRISH BLOOD IN THEM I WONDER WHAT SUCCESS HE'LL HAVE TO MORROW IF HE AND MISTER THORNTON WOULD SPEAK OUT TOGETHER AS MAN TO MAN IF HIGGINS WOULD FORGET THAT MISTER THORNTON WAS A MASTER AND SPEAK TO HIM AS HE DOES TO US
1734-142311-0084 AND TELL HIM HONESTLY THAT I KNEW I DESERVED IT IT SEEMS HARD TO LOSE HIM AS A FRIEND JUST WHEN I HAD BEGUN TO FEEL HIS VALUE HOW TENDER HE WAS WITH DEAR MAMMA IF IT WERE ONLY FOR HER SAKE I WISH HE WOULD COME
