5660-101892-0000 FOR SOME TIME AFTER MC GINNIS WENT AWAY MARGARET REMAINED AT THE MILL HOUSE BUT SHE WAS RESTLESS AND UNHAPPY IN THE POSITION IN WHICH SHE FOUND HERSELF MC GINNIS TAUGHT AN EVENING CLASS AT THE MILL HOUSE AND SHE KNEW
5660-101892-0001 THAT IT COULD NOT BE EASY FOR HIM TO SEE HER SO FREQUENTLY NOW THAT THE ENGAGEMENT WAS BROKEN MARGARET BLAMED HERSELF BITTERLY NOT FOR THE BROKEN ENGAGEMENT BUT FOR THE FACT
5660-101892-0002 SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT SHE OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT THE FEELING SHE HAD FOR BOBBY WAS NOT LOVE AND SHE ASKED HERSELF SCORNFULLY WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO COULD GIVE THAT LOVE ALL UNSOUGHT TO A MAN
5660-101892-0003 IT SEEMED TO MARGARET AS SHE THOUGHT OF IT THAT THERE WAS NO WAY FOR HER TO TURN BUT TO LEAVE BOTH THE MILL HOUSE AND HILCREST FOR A TIME BOBBY WOULD BE HAPPIER WITH HER AWAY AND THE MILL HOUSE DID NOT NEED HER
5660-101892-0004 AND HAD MATERIALLY STRENGTHENED THE TEACHING FORCE AS FOR HILCREST SHE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT STAY AT HILCREST ANYWAY NOW
5660-101892-0005 BUT NOT NOW IT DID NOT TAKE MUCH PERSUASION ON THE PART OF MARGARET TO CONVINCE MISSUS MERIDETH THAT A WINTER ABROAD WOULD BE DELIGHTFUL JUST THEY TWO TOGETHER THE NEWS OF MARGARET'S BROKEN ENGAGEMENT HAD BEEN RECEIVED AT HILCREST
5660-101892-0006 WITH A JOYOUS RELIEF THAT WAS NEVERTHELESS CAREFULLY SUBDUED IN THE PRESENCE OF MARGARET HERSELF BUT MISSUS MERIDETH COULD NOT CONCEAL HER JOY THAT SHE WAS TO TAKE MARGARET AWAY FROM THE WHOLE UNFORTUNATE AFFAIR AS SHE EXPRESSED IT TO HER BROTHERS
5660-101892-0007 BUT MARGARET I DON'T SEE WHY YOU MUST GO HE PROTESTED
5660-101892-0008 THEN SHE TURNED SWIFTLY AND FACED HIM FRANK BOBBY MC GINNIS WAS MY GOOD FRIEND FROM THE TIME WHEN I WAS A TINY LITTLE GIRL HE HAS BEEN THAT HE IS GOOD AND TRUE AND NOBLE BUT I HAVE BROUGHT HIM NOTHING BUT SORROW
5660-101892-0009 HE WILL BE HAPPIER NOW IF I AM QUITE OUT OF HIS SIGHT AT PRESENT I AM GOING AWAY FRANK SPENCER STIRRED UNEASILY BUT
5660-101892-0010 OH BUT IF I'M HERE I SHALL BE THERE CONTESTED MARGARET WITH A HASTE THAT REFUSED TO CONSIDER LOGIC THEN AS SHE SAW THE WHIMSICAL SMILE COME INTO THE MAN'S EYES SHE ADDED BROKENLY
5660-101892-0011 YOU POOR CHILD OF COURSE YOU DO AND NO WONDER YOU ARE WORN OUT WITH THE STRAIN MARGARET SHE RAISED A PROTESTING HAND NO NO YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND I I HAVE MADE A FAILURE OF IT
5660-101892-0012 THERE WAS A FEVERISHNESS IN MARGARET'S MANNER AND A TREMULOUSNESS IN HER VOICE
5660-101892-0013 BUT MY DEAR MARGARET ARGUED THE MAN THERE'S NOTHING THE MATTER WITH IT IT'S NO FAILURE AT ALL YOU'VE DONE WONDERS DOWN THERE AT THE MILL HOUSE MARGARET SHOOK HER HEAD SLOWLY IT'S SO LITTLE
5660-101892-0014 SO VERY LITTLE COMPARED TO WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE SHE SIGHED THE MILL HOUSE IS GOOD AND DOES GOOD I ACKNOWLEDGE BUT IT'S SO PUNY AFTER ALL IT'S LIKE A TINY LITTLE OASIS IN A HUGE DESERT OF POVERTY AND DISTRESS
5660-101892-0015 WHAT MORE COULD YOU DO VENTURED THE MAN MARGARET ROSE AND MOVED RESTLESSLY AROUND THE ROOM I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID AT LAST
5660-101892-0016 OF THE FIRE ON ONE SIDE IS THE MAN TRYING TO PUT IT OUT ON THE OTHER IS THE EVIL ONE POURING ON OIL MY TWO HANDS ARE THE TWO MEN WITH ONE I FEED A HUNGRY CHILD OR NURSE A SICK WOMAN
5660-101892-0017 WITH THE OTHER I MAKE MORE CHILDREN HUNGRY AND MORE WOMEN SICK MARGARET ARE YOU MAD WHAT CAN YOU MEAN MERELY THIS IT IS VERY SIMPLE AFTER ALL WITH ONE HAND I RELIEVE THE CHILDREN'S SUFFERING WITH THE OTHER
5660-101892-0018 I TAKE DIVIDENDS FROM THE VERY MILLS THAT MAKE THE CHILDREN SUFFER A LONG TIME AGO I WANTED TO DIVVY UP WITH PATTY AND BOBBY AND THE REST I HAVE EVEN THOUGHT LATELY
5660-101892-0019 NOW WITH MY PEOPLE DOWN THERE AT THE MILLS AND HER VOICE RANG WITH SELF SCORN THE MAN FROWNED HE TOO GOT TO HIS FEET AND WALKED NERVOUSLY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM WHEN HE CAME BACK THE GIRL HAD SAT DOWN AGAIN
5660-101892-0020 HER ELBOWS WERE ON THE TABLE AND HER LINKED FINGERS WERE SHIELDING HER EYES INVOLUNTARILY THE MAN REACHED HIS HAND
5660-101892-0021 IT IS AT THE MILLS THEMSELVES THAT THE FIRST START MUST BE MADE THE FIRST BEGINNING OF THE DIVVYING UP PERHAPS IF THERE WERE SOME ONE TO SHOW US HE PAUSED THEN WENT ON UNSTEADILY
5660-101892-0022 I SUPPOSE IT'S USELESS TO SAY AGAIN WHAT I SAID THAT DAY MONTHS AGO THAT IF YOU STAYED HERE AND SHOWED HIM THE MAN WHO LOVES YOU THE BETTER WAY
5660-101892-0023 AND PICKED UP A BIT OF PAPER FROM THE FLOOR OF COURSE IT IS USELESS SHE RETORTED IN WHAT SHE HOPED WAS A MERRY VOICE AND HE DOESN'T EVEN LOVE ME NOW BESIDES HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU FRANK SPENCER'S EYES AND VOICE WERE AMAZED
5660-101892-0024 OF COURSE NOT HE NEVER DID FOR THAT MATTER TWAS ONLY THE FANCY OF A MOMENT WHY FRANK NED NEVER CARED FOR ME THAT WAY NED THE TONE AND THE ONE WORD WERE ENOUGH
5660-101892-0025 FOR ONE MOMENT MARGARET GAZED INTO THE MAN'S FACE WITH STARTLED EYES THEN SHE TURNED AND COVERED HER OWN TELLTALE FACE WITH HER HANDS AND BECAUSE IT WAS A TELLTALE FACE SPENCER TOOK A LONG STRIDE TOWARD HER
5660-101892-0026 MARGARET AND DID YOU THINK IT WAS NED I WAS PLEADING FOR WHEN ALL THE WHILE IT WAS I WHO WAS HUNGERING FOR YOU WITH A LOVE THAT SENT ME ACROSS THE SEAS TO RID MYSELF OF IT DID YOU MARGARET THERE WAS NO ANSWER
5660-101892-0027 MARGARET LOOK AT ME LET ME SEE YOUR EYES THERE WAS A NOTE OF TRIUMPHANT JOY IN HIS VOICE NOW STILL NO ANSWER MARGARET IT DID NOT GO THAT LOVE IT STAYED WITH ME DAY AFTER DAY
5660-101892-0028 AND MONTH AFTER MONTH AND IT ONLY GREW STRONGER AND DEEPER UNTIL THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT ME IN ALL THIS WORLD BUT YOU JUST YOU AND NOW MARGARET MY MARGARET HE SAID SOFTLY AND VERY TENDERLY
