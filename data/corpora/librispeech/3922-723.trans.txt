3922-723-0000 THE BABE THE EXAMINATION OF THE WITNESSES BEGAN BUT WE WILL NOT CONTINUE OUR STORY IN SUCH DETAIL AS BEFORE
3922-723-0001 AND SO WE WILL NOT DWELL ON HOW NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH IMPRESSED ON EVERY WITNESS CALLED THAT HE MUST GIVE HIS EVIDENCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH TRUTH AND CONSCIENCE AND THAT HE WOULD AFTERWARDS HAVE TO REPEAT HIS EVIDENCE ON OATH
3922-723-0002 HOW EVERY WITNESS WAS CALLED UPON TO SIGN THE PROTOCOL OF HIS EVIDENCE AND SO ON WE WILL ONLY NOTE THAT THE POINT PRINCIPALLY INSISTED UPON IN THE EXAMINATION WAS THE QUESTION OF THE THREE THOUSAND ROUBLES THAT IS WAS THE SUM SPENT HERE AT MOKROE
3922-723-0003 BY MITYA ON THE FIRST OCCASION A MONTH BEFORE THREE THOUSAND OR FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND AGAIN HAD HE SPENT THREE THOUSAND OR FIFTEEN HUNDRED YESTERDAY ALAS ALL THE EVIDENCE GIVEN BY EVERY ONE TURNED OUT TO BE AGAINST MITYA
3922-723-0004 THERE WAS NOT ONE IN HIS FAVOR AND SOME WITNESSES INTRODUCED NEW ALMOST CRUSHING FACTS IN CONTRADICTION OF HIS MITYA'S STORY THE FIRST WITNESS EXAMINED WAS TRIFON BORISSOVITCH HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST ABASHED AS HE STOOD BEFORE THE LAWYERS
3922-723-0005 HE HAD ON THE CONTRARY AN AIR OF STERN AND SEVERE INDIGNATION WITH THE ACCUSED WHICH GAVE HIM AN APPEARANCE OF TRUTHFULNESS AND PERSONAL DIGNITY HE SPOKE LITTLE AND WITH RESERVE WAITED TO BE QUESTIONED ANSWERED PRECISELY AND DELIBERATELY
3922-723-0006 THAT ALL THE PEASANTS ABOUT HERE WOULD TESTIFY THAT THEY HAD HEARD THE SUM OF THREE THOUSAND MENTIONED BY DMITRI FYODOROVITCH HIMSELF WHAT A LOT OF MONEY HE FLUNG AWAY ON THE GYPSY GIRLS ALONE HE WASTED A THOUSAND I DARESAY ON THEM ALONE
3922-723-0007 I DON'T BELIEVE I GAVE THEM FIVE HUNDRED WAS MITYA'S GLOOMY COMMENT ON THIS IT'S A PITY I DIDN'T COUNT THE MONEY AT THE TIME BUT I WAS DRUNK MITYA WAS SITTING SIDEWAYS WITH HIS BACK TO THE CURTAINS
3922-723-0008 HE LISTENED GLOOMILY WITH A MELANCHOLY AND EXHAUSTED AIR AS THOUGH HE WOULD SAY OH SAY WHAT YOU LIKE IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE NOW MORE THAN A THOUSAND WENT ON THEM DMITRI FYODOROVITCH RETORTED TRIFON BORISSOVITCH FIRMLY
3922-723-0009 YOU FLUNG IT ABOUT AT RANDOM AND THEY PICKED IT UP THEY WERE A RASCALLY THIEVISH LOT HORSE STEALERS THEY'VE BEEN DRIVEN AWAY FROM HERE OR MAYBE THEY'D BEAR WITNESS THEMSELVES HOW MUCH THEY GOT FROM YOU I SAW THE SUM IN YOUR HANDS MYSELF
3922-723-0010 COUNT IT I DIDN'T YOU DIDN'T LET ME THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH BUT BY THE LOOK OF IT I SHOULD SAY IT WAS FAR MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN HUNDRED INDEED WE'VE SEEN MONEY TOO WE CAN JUDGE OF AMOUNTS
3922-723-0011 AS FOR THE SUM SPENT YESTERDAY HE ASSERTED THAT DMITRI FYODOROVITCH HAD TOLD HIM AS SOON AS HE ARRIVED THAT HE HAD BROUGHT THREE THOUSAND WITH HIM COME NOW IS THAT SO TRIFON BORISSOVITCH REPLIED MITYA
3922-723-0012 THAT IS WITH WHAT YOU SPENT BEFORE WE MUST UNDERSTAND STEPAN AND SEMYON HEARD IT AND PYOTR FOMITCH KALGANOV TOO WAS STANDING BESIDE YOU AT THE TIME MAYBE HE'D REMEMBER IT
3922-723-0013 THE PEASANTS AND THE DRIVER UNHESITATINGLY CONFIRMED TRIFON BORISSOVITCH'S EVIDENCE THEY NOTED DOWN WITH PARTICULAR CARE
3922-723-0014 WHERE SAYS HE AM I DMITRI FYODOROVITCH GOING TO HEAVEN OR TO HELL AND SHALL I BE FORGIVEN IN THE NEXT WORLD OR NOT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IPPOLIT KIRILLOVITCH HEARD THIS WITH A SUBTLE SMILE
3922-723-0015 AND HE SPOKE TO THE LAWYERS AS THOUGH HE HAD NEVER MET THEM BEFORE IN HIS LIFE THOUGH THEY WERE ACQUAINTANCES WHOM HE HAD BEEN MEETING EVERY DAY FOR A LONG TIME PAST HE BEGAN BY SAYING THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT AND DIDN'T WANT TO
3922-723-0016 IN REPLY TO REITERATED QUESTIONS HE STATED THAT AFTER THE POLES HAD BEEN TURNED OUT MITYA'S POSITION WITH AGRAFENA ALEXANDROVNA HAD CERTAINLY IMPROVED AND THAT SHE HAD SAID THAT SHE LOVED HIM HE SPOKE OF AGRAFENA ALEXANDROVNA WITH RESERVE AND RESPECT
3922-723-0017 AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN A LADY OF THE BEST SOCIETY AND DID NOT ONCE ALLOW HIMSELF TO CALL HER GRUSHENKA IN SPITE OF THE YOUNG MAN'S OBVIOUS REPUGNANCE AT GIVING EVIDENCE IPPOLIT KIRILLOVITCH EXAMINED HIM AT GREAT LENGTH
3922-723-0018 THE POLES TOO WERE EXAMINED THOUGH THEY HAD GONE TO BED IN THEIR ROOM THEY HAD NOT SLEPT ALL NIGHT AND ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE POLICE OFFICERS THEY HASTILY DRESSED AND GOT READY REALIZING THAT THEY WOULD CERTAINLY BE SENT FOR
3922-723-0019 THEY GAVE THEIR EVIDENCE WITH DIGNITY THOUGH NOT WITHOUT SOME UNEASINESS THE LITTLE POLE TURNED OUT TO BE A RETIRED OFFICIAL OF THE TWELFTH CLASS WHO HAD SERVED IN SIBERIA AS A VETERINARY SURGEON HIS NAME WAS MUSSYALOVITCH
3922-723-0020 PAN VRUBLEVSKY TURNED OUT TO BE AN UNCERTIFICATED DENTIST ALTHOUGH NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH ASKED THEM QUESTIONS ON ENTERING THE ROOM THEY BOTH ADDRESSED THEIR ANSWERS TO MIHAIL MAKAROVITCH WHO WAS STANDING ON ONE SIDE
3922-723-0021 TAKING HIM IN THEIR IGNORANCE FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON AND IN COMMAND AND ADDRESSED HIM AT EVERY WORD AS PAN COLONEL ONLY AFTER SEVERAL REPROOFS FROM MIHAIL MAKAROVITCH HIMSELF THEY GRASPED THAT THEY HAD TO ADDRESS THEIR ANSWERS TO NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH ONLY
3922-723-0022 IT TURNED OUT THAT THEY COULD SPEAK RUSSIAN QUITE CORRECTLY EXCEPT FOR THEIR ACCENT IN SOME WORDS OF HIS RELATIONS WITH GRUSHENKA PAST AND PRESENT
3922-723-0023 TO SPEAK LIKE THAT IN HIS PRESENCE PAN MUSSYALOVITCH AT ONCE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE WORD SCOUNDREL AND BEGGED THAT IT SHOULD BE PUT DOWN IN THE PROTOCOL MITYA FUMED WITH RAGE
3922-723-0024 HE'S A SCOUNDREL A SCOUNDREL YOU CAN PUT THAT DOWN AND PUT DOWN TOO THAT IN SPITE OF THE PROTOCOL I STILL DECLARE THAT HE'S A SCOUNDREL HE CRIED THOUGH NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH DID INSERT THIS IN THE PROTOCOL HE SHOWED THE MOST PRAISEWORTHY TACT AND MANAGEMENT
3922-723-0025 AFTER STERNLY REPRIMANDING MITYA HE CUT SHORT ALL FURTHER INQUIRY INTO THE ROMANTIC ASPECT OF THE CASE AND HASTENED TO PASS TO WHAT WAS ESSENTIAL ONE PIECE OF EVIDENCE GIVEN BY THE POLES ROUSED SPECIAL INTEREST IN THE LAWYERS THAT WAS HOW IN THAT VERY ROOM
3922-723-0026 MITYA HAD TRIED TO BUY OFF PAN MUSSYALOVITCH AND HAD OFFERED HIM THREE THOUSAND ROUBLES TO RESIGN HIS CLAIMS SEVEN HUNDRED ROUBLES DOWN AND THE REMAINING TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TO BE PAID NEXT DAY IN THE TOWN
3922-723-0027 BUT THAT HIS MONEY WAS IN THE TOWN MITYA OBSERVED HOTLY THAT HE HAD NOT SAID THAT HE WOULD BE SURE TO PAY HIM THE REMAINDER NEXT DAY IN THE TOWN BUT PAN VRUBLEVSKY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT AND MITYA AFTER THINKING FOR A MOMENT ADMITTED FROWNING THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN AS THE POLES STATED
3922-723-0028 THE PROSECUTOR POSITIVELY POUNCED ON THIS PIECE OF EVIDENCE IT SEEMED TO ESTABLISH FOR THE PROSECUTION AND THEY DID IN FACT BASE THIS DEDUCTION ON IT THAT HALF OR A PART OF THE THREE THOUSAND THAT HAD COME INTO MITYA'S HANDS
3922-723-0029 MIGHT REALLY HAVE BEEN LEFT SOMEWHERE HIDDEN IN THE TOWN OR EVEN PERHAPS SOMEWHERE HERE IN MOKROE THIS WOULD EXPLAIN THE CIRCUMSTANCE SO BAFFLING FOR THE PROSECUTION THAT ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED ROUBLES WERE TO BE FOUND IN MITYA'S HANDS
3922-723-0030 THIS CIRCUMSTANCE HAD BEEN THE ONE PIECE OF EVIDENCE WHICH INSIGNIFICANT AS IT WAS HAD HITHERTO TOLD TO SOME EXTENT IN MITYA'S FAVOR NOW THIS ONE PIECE OF EVIDENCE IN HIS FAVOR HAD BROKEN DOWN
3922-723-0031 IN ANSWER TO THE PROSECUTOR'S INQUIRY WHERE HE WOULD HAVE GOT THE REMAINING TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED ROUBLES SINCE HE HIMSELF HAD DENIED HAVING MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED MITYA CONFIDENTLY REPLIED THAT HE HAD MEANT TO OFFER THE LITTLE CHAP NOT MONEY
3922-723-0032 BUT A FORMAL DEED OF CONVEYANCE OF HIS RIGHTS TO THE VILLAGE OF TCHERMASHNYA THOSE RIGHTS WHICH HE HAD ALREADY OFFERED TO SAMSONOV AND MADAME HOHLAKOV THE PROSECUTOR POSITIVELY SMILED AT THE INNOCENCE OF THIS SUBTERFUGE
3922-723-0033 AND YOU IMAGINE HE WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED SUCH A DEED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED ROUBLES IN CASH HE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED IT MITYA DECLARED WARMLY WHY LOOK HERE HE MIGHT HAVE GRABBED NOT TWO THOUSAND BUT FOUR OR SIX FOR IT
3922-723-0034 HE WOULD HAVE PUT HIS LAWYERS POLES AND JEWS ON TO THE JOB AND MIGHT HAVE GOT NOT THREE THOUSAND BUT THE WHOLE PROPERTY OUT OF THE OLD MAN THE EVIDENCE OF PAN MUSSYALOVITCH WAS OF COURSE ENTERED IN THE PROTOCOL IN THE FULLEST DETAIL THEN THEY LET THE POLES GO
3922-723-0035 THE INCIDENT OF THE CHEATING AT CARDS WAS HARDLY TOUCHED UPON NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH WAS TOO WELL PLEASED WITH THEM AS IT WAS AND DID NOT WANT TO WORRY THEM WITH TRIFLES MOREOVER IT WAS NOTHING BUT A FOOLISH DRUNKEN QUARREL OVER CARDS
3922-723-0036 THERE HAD BEEN DRINKING AND DISORDER ENOUGH THAT NIGHT SO THE TWO HUNDRED ROUBLES REMAINED IN THE POCKETS OF THE POLES THEN OLD MAXIMOV WAS SUMMONED HE CAME IN TIMIDLY APPROACHED WITH LITTLE STEPS LOOKING VERY DISHEVELED AND DEPRESSED
3922-723-0037 HE HAD ALL THIS TIME TAKEN REFUGE BELOW WITH GRUSHENKA SITTING DUMBLY BESIDE HER
3922-723-0038 AS MIHAIL MAKAROVITCH DESCRIBED AFTERWARDS SO THAT SHE HERSELF BEGAN TRYING TO PACIFY AND COMFORT HIM THE OLD MAN AT ONCE CONFESSED THAT HE HAD DONE WRONG THAT HE HAD BORROWED TEN ROUBLES IN MY POVERTY FROM DMITRI FYODOROVITCH AND THAT HE WAS READY TO PAY IT BACK
3922-723-0039 TO NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH'S DIRECT QUESTION HAD HE NOTICED HOW MUCH MONEY DMITRI FYODOROVITCH HELD IN HIS HAND
3922-723-0040 WHEN MY WIFE MORTGAGED MY LITTLE PROPERTY SHE'D ONLY LET ME LOOK AT IT FROM A DISTANCE BOASTING OF IT TO ME IT WAS A VERY THICK BUNDLE ALL RAINBOW COLORED NOTES AND DMITRI FYODOROVITCH'S WERE ALL RAINBOW COLORED HE WAS NOT KEPT LONG
3922-723-0041 AT LAST IT WAS GRUSHENKA'S TURN NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH WAS OBVIOUSLY APPREHENSIVE OF THE EFFECT HER APPEARANCE MIGHT HAVE ON MITYA AND HE MUTTERED A FEW WORDS OF ADMONITION TO HIM BUT MITYA BOWED HIS HEAD IN SILENCE GIVING HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE WOULD NOT MAKE A SCENE
3922-723-0042 MIHAIL MAKAROVITCH HIMSELF LED GRUSHENKA IN
3922-723-0043 THE FIRST SYMPTOM OF THE LONG ILLNESS WHICH FOLLOWED THAT NIGHT HER GRAVE AIR HER DIRECT EARNEST LOOK AND QUIET MANNER MADE A VERY FAVORABLE IMPRESSION ON EVERY ONE NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH WAS EVEN A LITTLE BIT FASCINATED
3922-723-0044 HE ADMITTED HIMSELF WHEN TALKING ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS THAT ONLY THEN HAD HE SEEN HOW HANDSOME THE WOMAN WAS
3922-723-0045 BUT THIS WAS RECEIVED WITH POSITIVE INDIGNATION BY THE LADIES WHO IMMEDIATELY CALLED HIM A NAUGHTY MAN TO HIS GREAT SATISFACTION AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM GRUSHENKA ONLY GLANCED FOR AN INSTANT AT MITYA WHO LOOKED AT HER UNEASILY
3922-723-0046 BUT HER FACE REASSURED HIM AT ONCE AFTER THE FIRST INEVITABLE INQUIRIES AND WARNINGS
3922-723-0047 HESITATING A LITTLE BUT PRESERVING THE MOST COURTEOUS MANNER
3922-723-0048 TO FURTHER INQUISITIVE QUESTIONS SHE ANSWERED PLAINLY AND WITH COMPLETE FRANKNESS THAT THOUGH AT TIMES SHE HAD THOUGHT HIM ATTRACTIVE SHE HAD NOT LOVED HIM BUT HAD WON HIS HEART AS WELL AS HIS OLD FATHER'S IN MY NASTY SPITE
3922-723-0049 THAT SHE HAD SEEN THAT MITYA WAS VERY JEALOUS OF FYODOR PAVLOVITCH AND EVERY ONE ELSE BUT THAT HAD ONLY AMUSED HER SHE HAD NEVER MEANT TO GO TO FYODOR PAVLOVITCH SHE HAD SIMPLY BEEN LAUGHING AT HIM I HAD NO THOUGHTS FOR EITHER OF THEM ALL THIS LAST MONTH
3922-723-0050 I WAS EXPECTING ANOTHER MAN WHO HAD WRONGED ME BUT I THINK SHE SAID IN CONCLUSION THAT THERE'S NO NEED FOR YOU TO INQUIRE ABOUT THAT NOR FOR ME TO ANSWER YOU FOR THAT'S MY OWN AFFAIR NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH IMMEDIATELY ACTED UPON THIS HINT
3922-723-0051 HE AGAIN DISMISSED THE ROMANTIC ASPECT OF THE CASE AND PASSED TO THE SERIOUS ONE THAT IS TO THE QUESTION OF MOST IMPORTANCE CONCERNING THE THREE THOUSAND ROUBLES GRUSHENKA CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT THAT THREE THOUSAND ROUBLES HAD CERTAINLY BEEN SPENT ON THE FIRST CAROUSAL AT MOKROE
3922-723-0052 DID HE TELL YOU THAT ALONE OR BEFORE SOME ONE ELSE OR DID YOU ONLY HEAR HIM SPEAK OF IT TO OTHERS IN YOUR PRESENCE THE PROSECUTOR INQUIRED IMMEDIATELY TO WHICH GRUSHENKA REPLIED THAT SHE HAD HEARD HIM SAY SO BEFORE OTHER PEOPLE AND HAD HEARD HIM SAY SO WHEN THEY WERE ALONE
3922-723-0053 AND LEARNED THAT HE HAD TOLD GRUSHENKA SO SEVERAL TIMES IPPOLIT KIRILLOVITCH WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH THIS PIECE OF EVIDENCE FURTHER EXAMINATION ELICITED THAT GRUSHENKA KNEW TOO WHERE THAT MONEY HAD COME FROM AND THAT DMITRI FYODOROVITCH HAD GOT IT FROM KATERINA
3922-723-0054 IVANOVNA AND DID YOU NEVER ONCE HEAR THAT THE MONEY SPENT A MONTH AGO WAS NOT THREE THOUSAND BUT LESS AND THAT DMITRI FYODOROVITCH HAD SAVED HALF THAT SUM FOR HIS OWN USE NO I NEVER HEARD THAT ANSWERED GRUSHENKA
3922-723-0055 NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH PUT IN SUDDENLY THAT HE INTENDED TO MAKE AN ATTEMPT ON HIS FATHER'S LIFE ACH HE DID SAY SO SIGHED GRUSHENKA ONCE OR SEVERAL TIMES HE MENTIONED IT SEVERAL TIMES ALWAYS IN ANGER AND DID YOU BELIEVE HE WOULD DO IT
3922-723-0056 NO I NEVER BELIEVED IT SHE ANSWERED FIRMLY I HAD FAITH IN HIS NOBLE HEART GENTLEMEN ALLOW ME CRIED MITYA SUDDENLY ALLOW ME TO SAY ONE WORD TO AGRAFENA ALEXANDROVNA IN YOUR PRESENCE YOU CAN SPEAK
3922-723-0057 NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH ASSENTED AGRAFENA ALEXANDROVNA MITYA GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR HAVE FAITH IN GOD AND IN ME I AM NOT GUILTY OF MY FATHER'S MURDER HAVING UTTERED THESE WORDS MITYA SAT DOWN AGAIN ON HIS CHAIR
3922-723-0058 GRUSHENKA STOOD UP AND CROSSED HERSELF DEVOUTLY BEFORE THE IKON THANKS BE TO THEE O LORD SHE SAID IN A VOICE THRILLED WITH EMOTION AND STILL STANDING SHE TURNED TO NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH AND ADDED
3922-723-0059 SHE DECLARED THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT SUM IT WAS BUT HAD HEARD HIM TELL SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT HE HAD THREE THOUSAND WITH HIM AND TO THE QUESTION WHERE HE GOT THE MONEY
3922-723-0060 AND THAT IF HE COULD BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE TO HER WITH HORSES FOR EXAMPLE
3922-723-0061 WOULD BE I THANK YOU SINCERELY SAID GRUSHENKA BOWING TO HIM I'M GOING WITH THIS OLD GENTLEMAN I AM DRIVING HIM BACK TO TOWN WITH ME AND MEANWHILE IF YOU'LL ALLOW ME I'LL WAIT BELOW TO HEAR WHAT YOU DECIDE ABOUT DMITRI FYODOROVITCH SHE WENT OUT
3922-723-0062 MITYA WAS CALM AND EVEN LOOKED MORE CHEERFUL BUT ONLY FOR A MOMENT HE FELT MORE AND MORE OPPRESSED BY A STRANGE PHYSICAL WEAKNESS HIS EYES WERE CLOSING WITH FATIGUE THE EXAMINATION OF THE WITNESSES WAS AT LAST OVER
3922-723-0063 MITYA GOT UP MOVED FROM HIS CHAIR TO THE CORNER BY THE CURTAIN LAY DOWN ON A LARGE CHEST COVERED WITH A RUG AND INSTANTLY FELL ASLEEP HE HAD A STRANGE DREAM UTTERLY OUT OF KEEPING WITH THE PLACE AND THE TIME
3922-723-0064 NOT FAR OFF WAS A VILLAGE HE COULD SEE THE BLACK HUTS AND HALF THE HUTS WERE BURNT DOWN THERE WERE ONLY THE CHARRED BEAMS STICKING UP AND AS THEY DROVE IN THERE WERE PEASANT WOMEN DRAWN UP ALONG THE ROAD A LOT OF WOMEN A WHOLE ROW
3922-723-0065 ALL THIN AND WAN WITH THEIR FACES A SORT OF BROWNISH COLOR ESPECIALLY ONE AT THE EDGE A TALL BONY WOMAN WHO LOOKED FORTY BUT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONLY TWENTY WITH A LONG THIN FACE AND IN HER ARMS WAS A LITTLE BABY CRYING
3922-723-0066 AND HER BREASTS SEEMED SO DRIED UP THAT THERE WAS NOT A DROP OF MILK IN THEM AND THE CHILD CRIED AND CRIED AND HELD OUT ITS LITTLE BARE ARMS WITH ITS LITTLE FISTS BLUE FROM COLD WHY ARE THEY CRYING
3922-723-0067 WHY ARE THEY CRYING MITYA ASKED AS THEY DASHED GAYLY BY IT'S THE BABE ANSWERED THE DRIVER THE BABE WEEPING
3922-723-0068 ITS LITTLE CLOTHES ARE FROZEN AND DON'T WARM IT BUT WHY IS IT WHY FOOLISH MITYA STILL PERSISTED WHY THEY'RE POOR PEOPLE BURNT OUT THEY'VE NO BREAD THEY'RE BEGGING BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN BURNT OUT NO NO
3922-723-0069 MITYA AS IT WERE STILL DID NOT UNDERSTAND TELL ME WHY IT IS THOSE POOR MOTHERS STAND THERE WHY ARE PEOPLE POOR WHY IS THE BABE POOR WHY IS THE STEPPE BARREN WHY DON'T THEY HUG EACH OTHER AND KISS
3922-723-0070 WHY DON'T THEY SING SONGS OF JOY WHY ARE THEY SO DARK FROM BLACK MISERY WHY DON'T THEY FEED THE BABE AND HE FELT THAT THOUGH HIS QUESTIONS WERE UNREASONABLE AND SENSELESS YET HE WANTED TO ASK JUST THAT
3922-723-0071 AND HE HAD TO ASK IT JUST IN THAT WAY AND HE FELT THAT A PASSION OF PITY SUCH AS HE HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE WAS RISING IN HIS HEART THAT HE WANTED TO CRY THAT HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING FOR THEM ALL SO THAT THE BABE SHOULD WEEP NO MORE
3922-723-0072 SO THAT THE DARK FACED DRIED UP MOTHER SHOULD NOT WEEP THAT NO ONE SHOULD SHED TEARS AGAIN FROM THAT MOMENT
3922-723-0073 REGARDLESS OF ALL OBSTACLES WITH ALL THE RECKLESSNESS OF THE KARAMAZOVS AND I'M COMING WITH YOU I WON'T LEAVE YOU NOW FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE I'M COMING WITH YOU HE HEARD CLOSE BESIDE HIM GRUSHENKA'S TENDER VOICE THRILLING WITH EMOTION
3922-723-0074 AND HIS HEART GLOWED AND HE STRUGGLED FORWARD TOWARDS THE LIGHT AND HE LONGED TO LIVE TO LIVE TO GO ON AND ON TOWARDS THE NEW BECKONING LIGHT AND TO HASTEN HASTEN NOW AT ONCE WHAT WHERE
3922-723-0075 HE EXCLAIMED OPENING HIS EYES AND SITTING UP ON THE CHEST AS THOUGH HE HAD REVIVED FROM A SWOON SMILING BRIGHTLY NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH WAS STANDING OVER HIM SUGGESTING THAT HE SHOULD HEAR THE PROTOCOL READ ALOUD AND SIGN IT
