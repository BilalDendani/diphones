3780-177788-0006 THAT MY ESTHER AIN'T A BAD GIRL MISSUS SAUNDERS SAT NODDING HER HEAD A SWEET UNCRITICAL MOTHER AND ESTHER UNDERSTOOD HOW UNSELFISHLY HER MOTHER LOVED HER AND HOW SIMPLY SHE THOUGHT OF HOW

3780-177788-0008 THEY LIVENS IT UP A BIT SHE SAID POINTING TO THE COLOURED SUPPLEMENTS FROM THE ILLUSTRATED PAPERS ON THE WALL THE CHINA SHEPHERD AND SHEPHERDESS YOU KNOW THEY WAS AT BARNSTAPLE
3780-177788-0009 WHEN ESTHER WAS DRESSED SHE AND MISSUS SAUNDERS KNELT DOWN AND SAID A PRAYER TOGETHER
3780-177788-0010 AND WHEN THAT WAS DONE SHE INSISTED ON HELPING HER MOTHER WITH THE HOUSEWORK IN THE AFTERNOON SHE SAT WITH HER SISTERS HELPING THEM WITH THEIR DOGS FOLDING THE PAPER INTO THE MOULDS PASTING IT DOWN OR CUTTING THE SKINS INTO THE REQUISITE SIZES ABOUT FIVE
3780-177788-0011 WHEN THE CHILDREN HAD HAD THEIR TEA SHE AND HER MOTHER WENT FOR A SHORT WALK VERY OFTEN THEY STROLLED THROUGH VICTORIA STATION AMUSED BY THE BUSTLE OF THE TRAFFIC OR MAYBE THEY WANDERED DOWN THE BUCKINGHAM PALACE ROAD ATTRACTED BY THE SHOPS
3780-177788-0012 AND THERE WAS A SAD PLEASURE IN THESE WALKS THE ELDER WOMAN HAD BORNE YEARS OF EXCEEDING TROUBLE AND FELT HER STRENGTH FAILING UNDER HER BURDENS WHICH INSTEAD OF LIGHTENING
3780-177788-0013 WERE INCREASING THE YOUNGER WOMAN WAS FULL OF NERVOUS APPREHENSION FOR THE FUTURE AND GRIEF FOR THE PAST BUT THEY LOVED EACH OTHER DEEPLY ESTHER THREW HERSELF IN THE WAY TO PROTECT HER MOTHER WHETHER AT A DANGEROUS CROSSING
3780-177788-0014 OR FROM THE HEEDLESSNESS OF THE CROWD AT A CORNER AND OFTEN A PASSER BY TURNED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED AFTER THEM ATTRACTED BY THE SOLICITUDE WHICH THE YOUNGER WOMAN SHOWED FOR THE ELDER IN THOSE WALKS VERY LITTLE WAS SAID
3780-177788-0015 THEY WALKED IN SILENCE SLIPPING NOW AND THEN INTO OCCASIONAL SPEECH AND HERE AND THERE A CASUAL ALLUSION OR A BROKEN SENTENCE WOULD INDICATE WHAT WAS PASSING IN THEIR MINDS
3780-177788-0016 ONE DAY SOME FLANNEL AND SHIRTS IN A WINDOW CAUGHT MISSUS SAUNDER'S EYE AND SHE SAID IT IS TIME ESTHER YOU THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR BABY CLOTHES ONE MUST BE PREPARED
3780-177788-0017 THE WORDS CAME UPON ESTHER WITH SOMETHING OF A SHOCK HELPING HER TO REALISE THE IMMINENCE OF HER TROUBLE YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING BY YOU DEAR ONE NEVER KNOWS HOW IT IS GOING TO TURN OUT EVEN I WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH IT
3780-177788-0018 DO FEEL THAT NERVOUS I LOOKS ROUND THE KITCHEN WHEN I'M TAKEN WITH THE PAINS AND I SAYS I MAY NEVER SEE THIS ROOM AGAIN THE WORDS WERE SAID IN AN UNDERTONE TO ESTHER
3780-177788-0019 AND THE SHOP WOMAN TURNED TO GET DOWN THE READY MADE THINGS WHICH MISSUS SAUNDERS HAD ASKED TO SEE HERE SAID THE SHOPWOMAN IS THE GOWN LONGCLOTH ONE AND SIXPENCE HERE IS THE FLANNEL

3780-177788-0021 EVEN THE SHOPWOMAN SMILED AND MISSUS SAUNDERS ADDRESSING THE SHOPWOMAN SAID THEM THAT KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT IS ALLUS FULL OF OPE
3780-177788-0022 AND INQUIRED SYMPATHETICALLY IF THIS WAS THE YOUNG LADY'S FIRST CONFINEMENT MISSUS SAUNDERS NODDED AND SIGHED AND THEN THE SHOPWOMAN ASKED MISSUS SAUNDERS IF SHE REQUIRED ANY BABY CLOTHES
3780-177788-0023 MISSUS SAUNDERS SAID SHE HAD ALL SHE REQUIRED THE PARCEL WAS MADE UP AND THEY WERE PREPARING TO LEAVE WHEN ESTHER SAID I MAY AS WELL BUY THE MATERIAL AND MAKE ANOTHER SET IT WILL GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO IN THE AFTERNOONS

3780-177788-0026 YOU WILL WANT A FINER LONGCLOTH FOR THE LITTLE SHIRTS AND EVERY AFTERNOON ESTHER SAT IN THE PARLOUR BY THE WINDOW SEEING
3780-177788-0027 THE LOW BRICK STREET FULL OF CHILDREN AND HEARING THE WORKING WOMEN CALLING FROM THE OPEN DOORS OR WINDOWS AND AS SHE WORKED AT THE BABY CLOTHES NEVER PERHAPS TO BE WORN HER HEART SANK AT THE LONG PROSPECT THAT AWAITED HER
3780-177788-0028 THE END OF WHICH SHE COULD NOT SEE FOR IT SEEMED TO REACH TO THE VERY END OF HER LIFE IN THESE HOURS SHE REALISED IN SOME MEASURE THE DUTIES THAT LIFE HELD IN STORE AND IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THEY EXCEEDED HER STRENGTH
3780-177788-0029 NEVER WOULD SHE BE ABLE TO BRING HIM UP HE WOULD HAVE NO ONE TO LOOK TO BUT HER SHE NEVER IMAGINED OTHER THAN THAT HER CHILD WOULD BE A BOY THE TASK WAS CLEARLY MORE THAN SHE COULD PERFORM
3780-177788-0030 AND IN DESPAIR SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR IT TO DIE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SHE REMAINED OUT OF A SITUATION HER FATHER WOULD NOT HAVE HER AT HOME THAT SHE KNEW WELL ENOUGH WHAT SHOULD SHE DO
3780-177788-0031 AND THE LIFE OF ANOTHER DEPENDING ON HER SHE WOULD NEVER SEE WILLIAM AGAIN THAT WAS CERTAIN HE HAD MARRIED A LADY AND WERE THEY TO MEET HE WOULD NOT LOOK AT HER HER TEMPER GREW HOT AND THE MEMORY OF THE INJUSTICE
3780-177788-0032 OF WHICH SHE HAD BEEN A VICTIM PRESSED UPON HER BUT WHEN VAIN ANGER PASSED AWAY SHE THOUGHT OF HER BABY ANTICIPATING THE JOY SHE WOULD EXPERIENCE WHEN HE HELD OUT TINY HANDS TO HER AND THAT TOO WHICH SHE WOULD FEEL
3780-177788-0033 WHEN HE LAID AN INNOCENT CHEEK TO HERS AND HER DREAM PERSISTING SHE SAW HIM LEARNING A TRADE GOING TO WORK IN THE MORNING
3780-177788-0034 PROUD IN THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF SOMETHING DONE OF GOOD MONEY HONESTLY EARNED
3780-177788-0035 AND WHOSE CONDITION WAS RENDERED WORSE BY HER NERVOUS FEARS THAT SHE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH THIS CONFINEMENT FOR THE DOCTOR HAD TOLD MISSUS SAUNDERS THAT THE NEXT TIME IT MIGHT GO HARD WITH HER AND IN THIS HOUSE
3780-177788-0036 HER HUSBAND GROWING MORE RECKLESS AND DRUNKEN IT WAS ALTOGETHER A BAD LOOK OUT AND SHE MIGHT DIE FOR WANT OF A LITTLE NOURISHMENT OR A LITTLE CARE UNFORTUNATELY THEY WOULD BOTH BE DOWN AT THE SAME TIME AND IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT ESTHER
3780-177788-0037 THAT BRUTE IT WAS WRONG TO THINK OF HER FATHER SO BUT HE SEEMED TO BE WITHOUT MERCY FOR ANY OF THEM HE HAD COME IN YESTERDAY HALF BOOZED HAVING KEPT BACK PART OF HIS MONEY HE HAD COME IN TRAMPING AND HICCUPING

3780-177788-0045 MIGHT BE THE VERY SUM REQUIRED TO PUT HER ON HER FEET AGAIN AND SEND HER IN SEARCH OF A SITUATION
3780-177788-0046 BUT IF THIS EXTORTION CONTINUED SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT SHE WOULD DO
