8625-211892-0001 AND I HEARD THE CLATTER OF HER PAIL AS SHE WENT TO FETCH WATER FROM THE BROOK WHEREFORE I PRESENTLY STEPPED OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE MY COAT AND NECKCLOTH ACROSS MY ARM TO PLUNGE MY HEAD AND FACE INTO THE BROOK AND CARRY BACK THE HEAVY BUCKET FOR HER AS WAS MY CUSTOM
8625-211892-0002 THE WATER RAN DEEP AND VERY STILL JUST HERE OVERHUNG BY ASH AND ALDER AND WILLOW WHOSE SLENDER CURVING BRANCHES FORMED A LEAFY BOWER WHEREIN SHE HALF KNELT HALF SAT BENDING OVER TO REGARD HERSELF IN THE PLACID WATER
8625-211892-0003 FOR A LONG MOMENT SHE REMAINED THUS
8625-211892-0004 I VOW YOU ARE YOUR ENEMIES MIGHT ALMOST CALL YOU STRAPPING ALACK AND THEN YOUR COMPLEXION MY DEAR YOUR ADORABLE COMPLEXION SHE WENT ON WITH A RUEFUL SHAKE OF HER HEAD

8625-211892-0009 HEIGHHO SIGHING THUS SHE BROKE OFF A SPRAY OF LEAVES AND PROCEEDED TO TWINE THEM IN AMONG THE LUSTROUS COILS OF HER HAIR BENDING OVER HER REFLECTION MEANWHILE AND TURNING HER HEAD THIS WAY AND THAT TO NOTE THE EFFECT
8625-211892-0010 NODDING AT HER IMAGE WITH A SATISFIED AIR THAT TOUCH OF GREEN SETS OFF YOUR GIPSY COMPLEXION ADMIRABLY MY DEAR I COULD POSITIVELY KISS YOU I VOW I COULD AND I AM HARD TO PLEASE SAINT ANTHONY HIMSELF MEETING YOU ALONE IN THE DESERT WOULD AT LEAST HAVE RUN AWAY FROM YOU
8625-211892-0011 BUT OUR PHILOSOPHER WILL JUST GLANCE AT YOU WITH HIS SLOW GRAVE SMILE AND TELL YOU IN HIS SOLEMN AFFABLE WAY THAT IT IS A VERY FINE MORNING HEIGHO HERE SOMEWHAT LATE IN THE DAY PERHAPS PERCEIVING THAT I WAS PLAYING EAVESDROPPER
8625-211892-0012 I MOVED CAUTIOUSLY AWAY AND TAKING UP THE PAIL RETURNED TO THE COTTAGE I NOW FILLED THE KETTLE AND SET IT UPON THE FIRE AND PROCEEDED TO SPREAD THE CLOTH A LUXURIOUS INSTITUTION OF CHARMIAN'S ON WHICH SHE INSISTED AND TO LAY OUT THE BREAKFAST THINGS
8625-211892-0013 IN THE MIDST OF WHICH HOWEVER CHANCING TO FALL INTO A REVERIE I BECAME OBLIVIOUS OF ALL THINGS TILL ROUSED BY A STEP BEHIND ME AND TURNING BEHELD CHARMIAN STANDING WITH THE GLORY OF THE SUN ABOUT HER LIKE THE SPIRIT OF SUMMER HERSELF
8625-211892-0014 BROAD OF HIP AND SHOULDER YET SLENDER AND LONG OF LIMB ALL WARMTH AND LIFE AND LONG SOFT CURVES FROM THROAT TO ANKLE PERFECT WITH VIGOROUS YOUTH FROM THE LEAVES THAT CROWNED HER BEAUTY TO THE FOOT THAT SHOWED BENEATH HER GOWN AND AS I GAZED UPON HER SILENT AND WONDERING LO
8625-211892-0015 THOUGH HER MOUTH WAS SOLEMN YET THERE WAS LAUGHTER IN HER EYES AS SHE SPOKE WELL SIR HAVE YOU NO GREETING FOR ME IT IS A VERY FINE MORNING SAID I AND NOW THE MERRIMENT OVERFLOWED HER EYES AND SHE LAUGHED YET BLUSHED A LITTLE TOO AND
8625-211892-0016 LOWERED HER EYES FROM MINE AND SAID STILL LAUGHING OH PETER THE TEAPOT DO MIND THE TEAPOT TEAPOT I REPEATED AND THEN I SAW THAT I STILL HELD IT IN MY HAND PRAY SIR WHAT MIGHT YOU BE GOING TO DO WITH THE TEAPOT IN ONE HAND AND THAT FORK IN THE OTHER
8625-211892-0017 IS THAT WHY YOU WERE STANDING THERE STARING AT THE KETTLE WHILE IT BOILED OVER I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE KETTLE SAID I SO CHARMIAN TOOK THE TEAPOT FROM ME AND SET ABOUT BREWING THE TEA SINGING MERRILY THE WHILE
8625-211892-0018 ANON SHE BEGAN TO FRY THE BACON GIVING EACH INDIVIDUAL SLICE ITS DUE AMOUNT OF CARE AND ATTENTION BUT HER EYES CHANCING TO MEET MINE THE SONG DIED UPON HER LIP HER LASHES FLICKERED AND FELL WHILE UP FROM THROAT TO BROW THERE CREPT A SLOW HOT WAVE OF CRIMSON
8625-211892-0019 AND IN THAT MOMENT I TURNED AWAY AND STRODE DOWN TO THE BROOK NOW IT HAPPENED THAT I CAME TO THAT SAME SPOT WHERE SHE HAD LEANED AND FLINGING MYSELF DOWN I FELL TO STUDYING MY REFLECTION IN THE WATER EVEN AS SHE HAD DONE HERETOFORE THOUGH I HAD PAID SCANT HEED TO MY APPEARANCE
8625-211892-0020 I HAD BEEN CONTENT IN A CERTAIN IMPERSONAL SORT OF WAY HAD DRESSED IN THE FASHION AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SUCH ADORNMENTS AS WERE IN FAVOR AS MUCH FROM HABIT AS FROM ANY SET DESIGN BUT NOW LYING BESIDE THE BROOK WITH MY CHIN PROPPED IN MY HANDS
8625-211892-0021 I BEGAN TO STUDY MYSELF CRITICALLY FEATURE BY FEATURE AS I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF DOING BEFORE MIRRORED IN THE CLEAR WATERS I BEHELD A FACE LEAN AND BROWN AND WITH LANK BLACK HAIR EYES DARK AND OF A STRANGE BRILLIANCE LOOKED AT ME FROM BENEATH A STEEP PROMINENCE OF BROW
8625-211892-0022 I SAW A SOMEWHAT HIGH BRIDGED NOSE WITH THIN NERVOUS NOSTRILS A LONG CLEFT CHIN AND A DISDAINFUL MOUTH TRULY A SATURNINE FACE COLD AND DARK AND UNLOVELY AND THUS EVEN AS I GAZED
8625-211892-0023 AND YET IN THAT SAME MOMENT I FOUND MYSELF SIGHING WHILE I STROVE TO LEND SOME ORDER TO THE WILDNESS OF MY HAIR FOOL SAID I AND PLUNGED MY HEAD BENEATH THE WATER
8625-211892-0024 I SAW THAT MY HAIR WAS WILDER THAN EVER ALL RUBBED INTO LONG ELF LOCKS STRAIGHTWAY I LIFTED MY HANDS AND WOULD HAVE SMOOTHED IT SOMEWHAT BUT CHECKED THE IMPULSE LET BE SAID I TO MYSELF TURNING AWAY LET BE
