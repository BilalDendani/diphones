8527-281132-0000 WITH WHICH THEY ESCAPED UNPERCEIVED EARLY THE NEXT MORNING THE SIGNS OF THE INDIANS WERE DISCOVERED KIT CARSON WITH TWELVE OF HIS COMPANIONS IMMEDIATELY SADDLED THEIR HORSES AND STARTED IN PURSUIT
8527-281132-0001 IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW THE TRAIL OF THE INDIANS FROM THE FACT THAT MANY HERDS OF BUFFALO HAD CROSSED AND REPEATEDLY RECROSSED IT DURING THE NIGHT MAKING THE TRACKS VERY INDISTINCT
8527-281132-0002 HAVING TRAVELED FORTY MILES THEIR HORSES WHICH WERE VERY POOR IN FLESH BECAME FATIGUED CAUSING THEM TO THINK OF MAKING A HALT
8527-281132-0003 IT WAS AGREED THAT THEY HAD BEST GO INTO CAMP WITH THIS OBJECT IN VIEW THEY TRAVELED TOWARDS SOME TIMBER WHICH WAS NEAR BY ON ARRIVING AT THE WOODS THE ADVANCE OF THE PARTY TO THEIR SURPRISE AND NOT LESS TO THEIR SATISFACTION DISCOVERED THE SMOKE OF THEIR ENEMIES FIRES
8527-281132-0004 THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE PARTIES WAS INCONSIDERABLE BUT IN ORDER THAT THEIR MOVEMENTS MIGHT BE MADE UNOBSERVED THE TRAPPERS RETREATED TO A SECLUDED SPOT WHERE THEY AWAITED THE NIGHT JUDGING IT BEST TO TAKE THE PARTY BY SURPRISE
8527-281132-0005 THEIR FIRST CARE WAS TO SECURE AND PROVIDE FOR THEIR ANIMALS THE SECOND WAS TO PREPARE THEIR ARMS AS SOON AS IT WOULD DO FOR THEM TO MOVE THEY STARTED EAGER FOR THE STRIFE
8527-281132-0006 AS FROM THIS SOURCE THEY WISELY JUDGED THE RED MEN WOULD BE LESS APPREHENSIVE OF AN ATTACK THEIR MOVEMENTS WERE MADE SLOWLY AND WITH GREAT CARE IN ORDER NOT TO ALARM THE SAVAGES HAVING OBTAINED A POSITION CLOSE ENOUGH TO OBSERVE THE STRENGTH OF THEIR ENEMIES THEY STOPPED TO RECONNOITRE
8527-281132-0007 THE MEN THEN CREPT FOR A LONG DISTANCE ON THEIR HANDS AND KNEES UNTIL FINALLY THEY OBTAINED A FULL VIEW OF THE INDIANS WHICH SHOWED THEM THAT THE SAVAGES HAD ERECTED TWO ROUGH FORTS AND THAT THEY WERE NOW DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTIES A DANCE WAS IN PROGRESS
8527-281132-0008 IN HONOR OF THE ROBBERY SO RECENTLY PERPETRATED WHICH PROVED CONCLUSIVELY THAT THEY WERE WITHOUT EVEN A SUSPICION OF DANGER JUST OUTSIDE ONE OF THE FORTS THE NINE STOLEN ANIMALS WERE SECURELY TIED THIS SIGHT DID NOT TEND TO ALLAY THE WRATH OF THE TRAPPERS
8527-281132-0009 THEY RESOLVED THAT COME WHAT MIGHT THE ATTEMPT TO REGAIN THEIR PROPERTY AND PUNISH THE INDIANS SHOULD BE MADE NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR STRENGTH TO INSURE SUCCESS IN SPITE OF THEIR WEAKNESS THEY DETERMINED TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES AND WAIT QUIETLY UNTIL THE INDIANS HAD LAIN DOWN FOR SLEEP
8527-281132-0010 DURING THIS TIME OF SUSPENSE THE TRAPPERS WERE SUBJECTED TO GREAT SUFFERING FOR THE WEATHER WAS INTENSELY COLD AND THEY POSSESSED BUT A SCANTY ALLOWANCE OF CLOTHING FIT FOR SUCH WORK BUT AS THERE IS AN END TO ALL THINGS THERE WAS AN END TO THE DANCE AND OTHER FESTIVITIES
8527-281132-0011 AND THE SAVAGES SOUGHT THEIR REST AT LAST THE TIME FOR ACTION ARRIVED KIT CARSON AND FIVE OF HIS COMPANIONS COMMENCED CRAWLING TOWARDS THE STOLEN HORSES WHICH ON REACHING WERE EASILY SET FREE BY CUTTING THEIR HALTERS THEY THEN THREW SNOW BALLS AT THEM
8527-281132-0012 AND BY THIS MEANS DROVE THEM AWAY WITHOUT DISTURBING THE SLEEPING INDIANS THE TRAPPERS WHO ACTED AS A RESERVE PARTY SOON AFTER JOINED KIT AND HIS COMPANIONS AND AFTER RETREATING SOME DISTANCE IN ORDER TO BE OUT OF THE HEARING OF THE ENEMY
8527-281132-0013 THEY HELD A COUNCIL TO OBTAIN THE VIEWS OF EACH MEMBER OF THE PARTY AS TO THEIR NEXT STEP IT APPEARED THAT A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION EXISTED SOME OF THE MEN WERE IN FAVOR OF RETURNING HAVING RECOVERED THEIR PROPERTY AND SUSTAINED NO DAMAGE THE REMAINDER
8527-281132-0014 WANTED SATISFACTION FOR THE TROUBLE AND HARDSHIP THEY HAD UNDERGONE WHILE IN PURSUIT OF THE THIEVES KIT CARSON AND TWO OTHERS COMPOSED THIS LATTER PARTY AND THUS WERE DETERMINED TO PUNISH THE THIEVES LET THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ATTEMPT BE EVER SO FATAL THE MORE PEACEFUL PARTY
8527-281132-0015 SEEING THIS EARNESTNESS COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN LEND THEIR AID IN THE FIGHT AND CHEERFULLY DID SO THERE ALWAYS EXISTED SUCH A FEELING OF BROTHERLY LOVE AMONG THE OLD TRAPPERS OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS THAT THE HOUR OF PERIL WAS NEVER THE HOUR FOR SEPARATION OR DESERTION
8527-281132-0016 THIS INSTANCE AFFORDS A FAIR EXAMPLE HOW THE MINORITY COULD EASILY RULE THE MAJORITY WHEN THE MINORITY HELD TO THE SIDE OF DANGER THE WHOLE BAND WERE NOW UNANIMOUS IN FAVOR OF THE ATTACK KIT CARSON WHO HAD FROM THE FIRST ACTED AS CAPTAIN
8527-281132-0017 ORDERED THREE MEN TO TAKE THE RECOVERED ANIMALS BACK TO WHERE THEY HAD SECURED THEIR SADDLE HORSES THEN WITH HIS COMRADES HE MARCHED DIRECTLY FOR THE INDIAN CAMP A DOG BELONGING TO THE ENEMY FIRST GAVE THE ALARM OF APPROACHING DANGER TO THE INDIANS BUT NOT UNTIL KIT AND HIS PARTY WERE WITHIN A FEW PACES OF THE FIRST FORT
8527-281132-0018 AS SOON AS THE OCCUPANTS OF THE FORT HEARD THE NOISE THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET AND THUS BECAME FAIR MARKS FOR THE UNERRING RIFLES OF THE TRAPPERS THE WHITES DID NOT THROW AWAY A SINGLE SHOT EVERY BALL STRUCK A WARRIOR IN SOME VITAL SPOT
8527-281132-0019 THOSE WHO SURVIVED RETREATED TO THE FORT OCCUPIED BY THEIR FRIENDS AND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE COMMENCED RETURNING THE FIRE BUT WITHOUT EXECUTION AS THE TRAPPERS ON DISCHARGING THEIR FIRST VOLLEY HAD WELL CONCEALED THEMSELVES BEHIND TREES FROM WHENCE THEY WERE SHOOTING ONLY WHEN SURE OF AN OBJECT IT WAS NOW NEARLY DAYBREAK
8527-281132-0020 THEY DID SO BUT THE WHITE MEN WHO WERE EXPERT FIGHTERS IN THIS KIND OF WARFARE
8527-281132-0021 THE REMAINDER IMMEDIATELY RETREATED INTO THE FORT AFTER CONSIDERABLE DELIBERATION THE INDIANS DECIDED ONCE MORE TO MAKE A SORTIE ON THEY CAME AND THIS TIME WITH SUCH DETERMINATION THAT THE TRAPPERS COULD NOT WITHSTAND THE ASSAULT BUT WERE COMPELLED TO RETREAT
8527-281132-0022 THEY DISPUTED HOWEVER EVERY INCH OF GROUND OVER WHICH THEY TROD AS THEY FELL BACK FROM ONE TREE TO ANOTHER CONTINUALLY MAKING THEIR BULLETS TELL WITH TERRIBLE EFFECT ON THEIR FOES THE THREE MEN WHO HAD BEEN SENT BACK WITH THE HORSES HAD JOINED THEIR COMRADES SOON AFTER THEY HAD COMMENCED RETREATING
8527-281132-0023 THEY HAD HEARD THE INCESSANT FIRING AND HAD BECOME CONVINCED THAT THE FIGHT WAS HOTLY CONTESTED AND THAT THEIR SERVICES WERE REQUIRED ON THEIR JOINING THE WHOLE PARTY RESOLVED TO MAKE ONE MORE STAND AND AS SOON AS THE INDIANS SAW THIS THEY WAVERED AND FINALLY DREW OFF
8527-281132-0024 BOTH SIDES HAD NOW SEEMINGLY HAD ENOUGH OF FIGHTING AND HOSTILITIES SOON AFTER ENTIRELY CEASED THE SAVAGES MARCHING BACK AND LEAVING THE WHITES MASTERS OF THE FIELD SEVERAL OF THE TRAPPERS WERE SLIGHTLY BUT NONE DANGEROUSLY WOUNDED THE INDIANS HAD PAID DEARLY IN NUMBERS KILLED
8527-281132-0025 FOR THEIR RASCALITY FINDING THE COAST CLEAR CARSON AND HIS MEN SET OUT AND SOON REJOINED THEIR COMRADES ON THE ARKANSAS RIVER IN THE SPRING AFTER HAVING CACHED THEIR FUR THE WHOLE BAND DEPARTED FOR LARAMIE RIVER ON ANOTHER EXPEDITION WHILE ON THE SOUTH FORK OF THE PLATTE TWO OF THE PARTY DESERTED
8527-281132-0026 TAKING WITH THEM THREE OF THEIR BEST ANIMALS SUSPECTING THEIR DESIGN GAUNT SENT KIT CARSON AND ANOTHER MAN IN PURSUIT OF THE FUGITIVES WHO HAD ONE DAY THE START AS WAS SUSPECTED THE TWO DESERTERS HAD GONE TO THE CAMP WHERE THE BEAVER FUR WAS CONCEALED AND BURIED THEY HAD SUCCEEDED IN DIGGING IT UP
8527-281132-0027 AND STEALING ABOUT THREE HUNDRED POUNDS OF THIS VALUABLE PROPERTY BELONGING TO THE COMPANY IN GENERAL SHARE AND SHARE ALIKE CARSON AND HIS COMPANION FAILED ENTIRELY IN THEIR EFFORTS TO FIND THE TWO MEN
8527-281132-0028 DOUBTLESS THEY NEVER LIVED TO ENJOY THEIR ILL GOTTEN WEALTH FOR NOTWITHSTANDING CAREFUL SEARCH WAS MADE THE MEN WERE NEVER HEARD FROM AFTERWARDS IT IS PROBABLE THAT THEY WERE KILLED BY INDIANS A FATE WHICH THEY AT LEAST RICHLY MERITED THIS OLD CAMP THE READER WILL PLEASE BEAR IN MIND WAS ON THE ARKANSAS RIVER
8527-281132-0029 AS HAS ALSO BEEN SEEN THEY WERE UNSUCCESSFUL IT NOW REMAINED FOR THEM TO DETERMINE THEIR FUTURE COURSE THE COUNTRY WAS SO INFESTED WITH HOSTILE INDIANS THAT IT MADE THEIR POSITION THUS ALONE VERY PRECARIOUS TO REGAIN THEIR COMMANDER'S COMPANY WAS ALMOST IMPRACTICABLE
8527-281132-0030 AT LEAST WITHOUT A MORE IMPORTANT OBJECT TO MAKE THE RISK NECESSARY IT WAS A FOOLHARDY ATTEMPT TIME IN LEARNING THE LOSS WAS OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE EITHER TO THEIR LEADER OR THEIR PARTY SOONER OR LATER THIS AS A MATTER OF COURSE WOULD BE FULLY SHOWN
8527-281132-0031 AND TO THIS END IMMEDIATELY ARRANGED EVERYTHING SO THAT THEY COULD MAKE A SUCCESSFUL DEFENCE IN CASE THEY SHOULD BE ATTACKED BY THE SAVAGES THEY DID NOT DARE TO VENTURE OUT FAR FROM THEIR FORTIFICATIONS BUT THIS WAS NO GREAT TRIAL TO THEM AS GAME EXISTED IN GREAT PLENTY AND CAME VERY NEAR THEIR FORTIFICATIONS
8527-281132-0032 WHILE ONE SLEPT THE OTHER STOOD ON GUARD IT WAS THEIR INTENTION TO AWAIT THE RETURN OF THEIR PARTY BUT AT THE EXPIRATION OF ONE MONTH THEY WERE QUITE HAPPILY RELIEVED FROM THEIR PERILOUS POSITION MISTER BLACKWELL MISTER GAUNT'S PARTNER ARRIVED FROM THE UNITED STATES
8527-281132-0033 HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY FIFTEEN MEN AND BROUGHT WITH HIM A COMPLETE OUTFIT FOR THE ENTIRE BAND
8527-281132-0034 THEY WERE ALSO MADE QUITE HAPPY IN OBTAINING THE ARTICLES OF OUTFIT WHICH WOULD RENDER THEIR WILD LIFE MORE AGREEABLE AND EASY SHORTLY AFTER THIS ARRIVAL FOUR MEN FROM THE TRAPPING PARTY CAME INTO CAMP AND BROUGHT THE NEWS AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF GAUNT AND HIS MEN
8527-281132-0035 THEY WERE OVERJOYED AT FINDING KIT AND HIS COMRADE
8527-281132-0036 AND FINALLY HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPES OF EVER SEEING THEM AGAIN
8527-281132-0037 THESE SPRINGS FORM THE HEAD WATERS OF THE SOUTH FORK OF THE RIVER PLATTE WHEN FOUR DAYS JOURNEY HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND WHILE THEY WERE PARTAKING OF THEIR BREAKFAST IN CAMP AN ALARM OF INDIANS WAS GIVEN BY ONE OF THE MEN
8527-281132-0038 HE HAD ACCIDENTALLY DISCOVERED THE RED SKIN RASCALS AS THEY WERE PROWLING ABOUT THE CAMP A RUSH WAS INSTANTLY MADE BY THE TRAPPERS WITH RIFLES IN HAND TO SAVE THEIR HORSES SHOTS WERE FIRED AND ONE INDIAN FELL
8527-281132-0039 THE REST OF THE BAND MADE OFF AS EMPTY HANDED AS THEY CAME WITH ONE EXCEPTION ONE BRAVE HAD SUCCEEDED IN CAPTURING AND MOUNTING A HORSE BEFORE THE WHITE MEN COULD REACH HIM NOTWITHSTANDING HE HAD A DEAD BROTHER LYING ON THE GROUND
8527-281132-0040 AT LEAST WITHOUT A PROPER INTRODUCTION ON THE CONTRARY HE GALLOPED OFF SEEMINGLY QUITE PROUD OF HIS TROPHY HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT THE TRAPPERS HAD TAKEN THE PRECAUTION TO HOBBLE THEIR HORSES BEFORE TURNING THEM OUT TO GRAZE
8527-281132-0041 THESE STAMPEDES ARE A SOURCE OF GREAT PROFIT TO THE INDIANS OF THE PLAINS
8527-281132-0042 THE CAMANCHES ARE PARTICULARLY EXPERT AND DARING IN THIS KIND OF ROBBERY
8527-281132-0043 WHEN A CAMP IS MADE WHICH IS NEARLY IN RANGE THEY TURN THEIR TRAINED ANIMALS LOOSE WHO AT ONCE FLY ACROSS THE PLAIN PENETRATING AND PASSING THROUGH THE CAMP OF THEIR VICTIMS ALL OF THE PICKETED ANIMALS WILL ENDEAVOR TO FOLLOW AND USUALLY SUCCEED IN FOLLOWING THE TRAINED HORSES
8527-281132-0044 SUCH ARE INVARIABLY LED INTO THE HAUNTS OF THE THIEVES WHO EASILY SECURE THEM YOUNG HORSES AND MULES ARE EASILY FRIGHTENED AND IN THE HAVOC WHICH GENERALLY ENSUES OFTENTIMES GREAT INJURY IS DONE TO THE RUNAWAYS THEMSELVES
8527-281132-0045 THE SIGHT OF A STAMPEDE ON A GRAND SCALE REQUIRES STEADY NERVES TO WITNESS WITHOUT TREMOR AND WOE TO THE FOOTMAN WHO CANNOT GET OUT OF THE WAY WHEN THE FRIGHTENED ANIMALS COME ALONG AT TIMES WHEN THE HERD IS VERY LARGE THE HORSES SCATTER OVER THE OPEN COUNTRY AND ARE IRRECOVERABLY LOST
8527-281132-0046 AND SUCH AS DO NOT BECOME WILD FALL A PREY TO THE RAVENOUS WOLVES SUCH MOST FREQUENTLY IS THE FATE OF STAMPEDED HORSES WHICH HAVE BEEN BRED IN THE STATES NOT BEING TRAINED BY A PRAIRIE LIFE EXPERIENCE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES
