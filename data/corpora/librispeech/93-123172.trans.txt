93-123172-0000 BUTTER CHEESE COFFEE TEA
93-123172-0001 FIRST IMPORTANCE THAT EVERY THING CONNECTED WITH MILK AND BUTTER SHOULD BE KEPT CLEAN IF THE MILK ACQUIRES AN UNPLEASANT TASTE IT COMMUNICATES IT TO THE BUTTER TIN PANS ARE BEST TO KEEP MILK IN
93-123172-0002 AND THEY SHOULD BE PAINTED ON THE OUTSIDE TO KEEP THEM FROM RUSTING WHEN THEY ARE PUT IN WATER IN SUMMER MILK SHOULD BE KEPT AS COOL AS POSSIBLE BEFORE IT IS STRAINED THE PANS AND STRAINER SHOULD BE RINSED WITH COLD WATER AND THE MILK NOT COVERED UNTIL IT IS COLD
93-123172-0003 IF YOU HAVE NO WAY OF KEEPING YOUR CREAM COOL IN HOT WEATHER IT OUGHT TO BE CHURNED TWICE A WEEK THE EARLIER IN THE MORNING THE BETTER ALWAYS PUT COLD WATER IN YOUR CHURN THE NIGHT BEFORE YOU USE IT AND CHANGE IT IN THE MORNING JUST BEFORE YOU PUT IN THE CREAM
93-123172-0004 WHEN THE BUTTER IS GATHERING TAKE OFF THE LID OF THE CHURN TO LET THE HEATED AIR ESCAPE AND MOVE IT GENTLY HAVE YOUR BUTTER LADLE AND PAN SCALDED AND COOLED TAKE OUT THE BUTTER AND WORK IT TILL ALL THE MILK IS OUT SCRAPE SOME LUMPS OF SALT AND WORK IN
93-123172-0005 IT IS BEST TO HAVE ONE KETTLE OR BASKET TO PUT THE BUTTER IN THAT IS USED AT THE TABLE IT SHOULD BE DEEP ENOUGH TO HOLD FIVE OR SIX PLATES EACH COVERED WITH A SAUCER IT CAN BE KEPT IN THIS WAY AS FIRM AND SWEET AS IN AN ICE HOUSE
93-123172-0006 IF YOU HAVE A SAFE TO KEEP IT IN IT NEED NOT BE COVERED CREAM TAKES MUCH LONGER TO RISE IN WINTER AFTER IT HAS STOOD TWO DAYS TO PUT IT ON THE TOP OF A MODERATELY HEATED STOVE WILL ASSIST IT WHEN IT IS HOT SET IT AWAY TO SKIM THE NEXT DAY
93-123172-0007 WHEN THE CREAM WILL BE THICK AND RICH AND CHURNS EASIER IF THE WEATHER IS VERY COLD AND THE CREAM HAS BEEN CHILLED HAVE A LARGE POT OF WATER OVER THE FIRE SET IN THE BUCKET WHEN IT IS NEAR BOILING HEAT AND KEEP STIRRING TILL IT IS MILK WARM HAVE THE CHURN SCALDED AND PUT IT IN
93-123172-0008 ONE GOOD WORKING ANSWERS VERY WELL FOR BUTTER IN WINTER ALWAYS SCALD THE CHURN BEFORE YOU PUT IN THE CREAM IN COLD WEATHER TO PUT UP BUTTER FOR WINTER WORK IT WELL AND SALT IT RATHER MORE THAN FOR TABLE USE
93-123172-0009 USE ONE OUNCE OF THIS COMPOSITION TO EVERY POUND OF BUTTER WORK IT WELL INTO THE MASS BUTTER CURED IN THIS WAY IT IS SAID WILL KEEP GOOD FOR SEVERAL YEARS I HAVE NEVER KEPT IT LONGER THAN FROM THE FALL UNTIL LATE IN THE SPRING
93-123172-0010 IT WAS THEN VERY SWEET AND GOOD IT WILL NOT DO TO USE FOR A MONTH BECAUSE EARLIER THE SALTS WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY BLENDED WITH IT IT SHOULD BE KEPT IN WOODEN VESSELS OR NICE STONE JARS EARTHEN WARE JARS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR BUTTER
93-123172-0011 AS DURING THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE SALTS THEY CORRODE THE GLAZING AND THE BUTTER BECOMES RANCID AND UNHEALTHY A FRIEND OF MINE AND A LADY OF MUCH EXPERIENCE REMARKED ON READING THE ABOVE
93-123172-0012 BEGIN BY PUTTING A LAYER OF THE PRINTS IN THE BOTTOM OF A STONE POT PRESS THE BUTTER DOWN CLOSE SO THAT NO CAVITIES FOR THE ADMISSION OF AIR MAY REMAIN THEN STREW MORE OF THE MIXTURE OVER IT PROCEED IN THIS MANNER UNTIL THE VESSEL IS FILLED
93-123172-0013 WHEN PUT ON THE TOP A SMALL MUSLIN BAG FILLED WITH SALT AND TIE THE JAR UP CLOSE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE BUTTER IN A COOL PLACE A GREAT DEAL DEPENDS ON THE BUTTER BEING WELL WORKED PERSONS THAT HAVE LARGE DAIRIES SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A MACHINE TO WORK IT
93-123172-0014 A LARGE CHURNING MAY BE MORE EFFECTUALLY CLEARED OF THE BUTTER MILK IN A FEW MINUTES THAN IN THE OLD WAY IN AN HOUR BY DOING IT QUICKLY IT DOES NOT GET SOFT AND OILY IN HOT WEATHER A PICKLE FOR BUTTER
93-123172-0015 TO THREE GALLONS OF WATER ADD FOUR AND A HALF POUNDS OF GOOD BROWN SUGAR ONE AND A HALF OUNCES OF SALTPETRE ONE OUNCE OF SALAERATUS PUT THEM INTO AN IRON POT AND LET THEM COME TO A BOIL TAKE OFF THE SCUM WHEN COLD IT IS READY FOR USE
93-123172-0016 WHEN THE PICKLE IS ENTIRELY COLD POUR IT OVER AND PUT A PLATE ON THE TOP WITH A WEIGHT ON IT TO KEEP THE BUTTER UNDER TIE IT UP CLOSE AND KEEP IT IN A COLD PLACE WHEN A ROLL IS WANTED TAKE IT OUT OF THE BAG AND SLICE IT OFF FOR TABLE USE
93-123172-0017 IT SHOULD BE PUT ON LITTLE PLATES AND EACH COVERED WITH A SAUCER TO EXCLUDE THE AIR IF THE BUTTER IS GOOD WHEN PUT UP IN THE FALL IT WILL KEEP TILL YOU CAN GET GRASS BUTTER IN THE SPRING THE JARS FOR THIS PURPOSE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY USED FOR PICKLES
93-123172-0018 WHEN IT IS NEAR BOILING PUT IT IN THE TUB WITH THE NEW MILK AND THE REST OF THE NIGHT'S MILK IT SHOULD BE RATHER MORE THAN MILK WARM
93-123172-0019 WASH AND WIPE THE VAT PUT IN A CLEAN CLOTH AND TURN IN THE CHEESE UPSIDE DOWN
93-123172-0020 YOU MAY MAKE CHEESE TWICE A WEEK AND STILL HAVE BUTTER FOR THE FAMILY YOU SHOULD KEEP FOUR THIN CLOTHS ON PURPOSE FOR CHEESE PENNSYLVANIA CREAM CHEESE THE CHEESE CALLED BY THIS NAME IS NOT IN REALITY MADE OF CREAM
93-123172-0021 SPREAD A THIN LINEN CLOTH OVER THE TOP AND AS THE WHEY RISES DIP IT OFF WITH A SAUCER PUT THE CURD AS WHOLE AS POSSIBLE INTO A CHEESE HOOP ABOUT THE SIZE OF A DINNER PLATE FIRST SPREADING A WET CLOTH INSIDE THEN FOLD THE CLOTH SMOOTHLY OVER THE TOP
93-123172-0022 PUT A WEIGHT ON THE TOP HEAVY ENOUGH TO MAKE THE WHEY DRAIN OUT GRADUALLY IN SIX OR SEVEN HOURS IT WILL BE READY TO TAKE OUT OF THE PRESS WHEN RUB IT OVER WITH FINE SALT SET IT IN A DRY DARK PLACE CHANGE IT FROM ONE PLATE TO ANOTHER TWICE A DAY
93-123172-0023 AND IT WILL BE FIT FOR USE IN LESS THAN A WEEK TO PREPARE RENNET FOR MAKING WHEY OR CHEESE WHEN THE RENNET IS TAKEN FROM THE CALF WASH IT LAY IT ON A PLATE WELL COVERED WITH SALT
93-123172-0024 PUT MORE ON IN TWO DAYS KEEP IT IN A COLD PLACE IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS IT WILL DO TO STRETCH ON STICKS HANG IT UP IN A DRY COOL PLACE WITH AS MUCH SALT AS WILL STICK TO IT WHEN QUITE DRY PUT IT IN A PAPER BAG AND HANG IT UP
93-123172-0025 THE SAME PIECE SALTED AND DRIED WILL DO SEVERAL TIMES COTTAGE CHEESE OR SMEARCASE
93-123172-0026 OR IN A POT OF WATER THAT IS BOILING OVER THE FIRE WHEN THE WHEY HAS RISEN SUFFICIENTLY POUR IT THROUGH A COLANDER AND PUT THE CURD OR CHEESE AWAY IN A COLD PLACE AND JUST BEFORE GOING TO TABLE SEASON IT WITH SALT AND PEPPER TO YOUR TASTE AND POUR SOME SWEET CREAM OVER IT
93-123172-0027 AND STIRRED IN THE COFFEE WHEN HALF COLD AND WELL MIXED THROUGH IT ARE SUFFICIENT TO CLEAR TWO POUNDS AND IS THE MOST ECONOMICAL WAY OF USING EGGS IT WILL ANSWER EITHER FOR SUMMER OR WINTER
93-123172-0028 MANY PERSONS USE COFFEE ROASTERS BUT SOME OLD EXPERIENCED HOUSEKEEPERS THINK THAT THE FINE FLAVOR FLIES OFF MORE THAN WHEN DONE IN A DUTCH OVEN AND CONSTANTLY STIRRED IF YOU ARE CAREFUL IT CAN BE DONE VERY WELL IN THE DRIPPING PAN OF A STOVE
93-123172-0029 PUT ABOUT TWO POUNDS IN A PAN STIR IT A FEW TIMES IT WILL ROAST GRADUALLY AND IF NOT SUFFICIENTLY BROWN FINISH IN A STOVE OR BEFORE THE FIRE
93-123172-0030 IF YOU HAVE A LARGE FAMILY BY USING SEVERAL PANS SIX POUNDS OF COFFEE CAN THUS BE ROASTED AND BUT LITTLE TIME SPENT ON IT BOILING COFFEE A LARGE TEA CUPFUL OF UNGROUND COFFEE WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR SIX PERSONS
93-123172-0031 UNLESS THEY TAKE IT VERY STRONG WHICH IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH GRIND IT AND PUT IT IN THE TIN POT WITH HALF A TEA CUP OF COLD WATER AND THE WHITE OF HALF AN EGG SHAKE IT TILL IT IS MIXED THEN POUR BOILING WATER ON IT AND LET IT STAND CLOSE TO THE FIRE
93-123172-0032 AND JUST COME TO A BOIL STIR IT AND DO NOT LET IT BOIL OVER LET IT KEEP AT BOILING HEAT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES THEN TAKE IT FROM THE FIRE AND PUT IN HALF A TEA CUP OF WATER TO SETTLE IT LET IT STAND FIVE MINUTES AND POUR IT OFF
93-123172-0033 PERSONS WITH WEAK NERVES SHOULD NEVER DRINK STRONG TEA AND COFFEE I HAVE KNOWN INSTANCES OF PERSONS BEING AFFLICTED WITH VIOLENT ATTACKS OF NERVOUS HEAD ACHE
93-123172-0034 AND THEIR GENERAL HEALTH WAS ALSO IMPROVED BY IT BEFORE POURING OUT TEA IT SHOULD BE STIRRED WITH A SPOON THAT THE STRENGTH OF EACH CUP MAY BE ALIKE MILK IS THE BEST DRINK FOR CHILDREN BUT IF THAT CANNOT BE HAD SWEETENED WATER WITH A LITTLE MILK WILL DO
