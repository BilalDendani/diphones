2488-155524-0000 FOR ONCE I ROSE WITH KENNEDY HE PRECEDED ME TO THE LABORATORY AFTER BREAKFAST HOWEVER LEAVING ME TO WAIT FOR MACKAY WHEN THE LITTLE DISTRICT ATTORNEY ARRIVED I NOTICED THAT HE CARRIED A PACKAGE WHICH LOOKED AS THOUGH IT MIGHT CONTAIN A ONE REEL FILM CAN
2488-155524-0001 THE NEGATIVE WE TOOK FROM THE CAMERAS AT TARRYTOWN HE EXPLAINED ALSO A PRINT FROM EACH ROLL READY TO RUN I'VE BEEN HOLDING THIS AS EVIDENCE MISTER KENNEDY WANTED ME TO BRING IT WITH ME TO DAY HE'S WAITING FOR US AT THE LABORATORY I REMARKED HE'LL STRAIGHTEN EVERYTHING UP IN A HURRY WON'T HE
2488-155524-0002 IF HE SEES A CHANCE OF GETTING HIS MAN THEN I BECAME ENTHUSIASTIC OFTEN I'VE SEEN HIM GATHER A GROUP OF PEOPLE IN A ROOM PERHAPS WITHOUT THE FAINTEST SHRED OF LEGAL RIGHT TO DO SO AND THERE MAKE THE GUILTY PERSON CONFESS SIMPLY BY MARSHALING THE EVIDENCE
2488-155524-0003 OR MAYBE BETRAY HIMSELF BY SOME SCIENTIFIC DEVICE
2488-155524-0004 I LED THE WAY TO THE DOOR AFTER WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT I KNOW THAT KENNEDY WILL RESORT TO ALMOST ANYTHING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FINGERED THE PACKAGE UNDER HIS ARM
2488-155524-0005 WE SHALL GET UP TO THE STUDIO AND START WELL I GUESS YOU COULD CALL IT FISHING FOR THE GUILTY MAN HE FINGERED THE FOLDS THEN JERKED THE TOWEL DOWN AND FLUNG IT TO ME
2488-155524-0006 HERE WALTER IT'S DRY ENOUGH NOW I WANT YOU TO RUB THE CONTENTS OF THAT TINY CAN OF GREASE OPEN BEFORE YOU THERE INTO THE CLOTH HE HURRIED OVER TO WASH HIS HANDS
2488-155524-0007 THEN ABSENTLY I TOUCHED THE BACK OF ONE HAND WITH THE GREASY FINGERS OF THE OTHER AND IMMEDIATELY AN ITCHING SET UP SO ANNOYING THAT I HAD TO ABANDON MY TASK KENNEDY CHUCKLED THAT'S ITCHING SALVE WALTER
2488-155524-0008 THE CUTICLE PADS AT YOUR FINGER TIPS ARE TOO THICK BUT TOUCH YOURSELF ANYWHERE ELSE HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS YOU'D BETTER USE SOAP AND WATER IF YOU WANT ANY RELIEF THEN YOU CAN START OVER AGAIN
2488-155524-0009 MACKAY SUGGESTED AND WATCH TO SEE WHO CAME AFTER IT BECAUSE OUR CRIMINAL'S TOO CLEVER KENNEDY REJOINED OUR ONLY CHANCE TO GET IT STOLEN IS TO MAKE IT VERY PLAIN THAT IT IS NOT BEING WATCHED WHOEVER STEALS IT HOWEVER POSSIBLY WILL REVEAL HIMSELF ON ACCOUNT OF THE ITCHING SALVE
2488-155524-0010 WILL YOU BE ABLE TO HELP ME TO STAY WITH JAMESON AND MYSELF ALL DAY KENNEDY ASKED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AFTER PERHAPS A MILE OF SILENCE SURELY IT'S WHAT I WAS HOPING YOU'D ALLOW ME TO DO I HAVE NO AUTHORITY DOWN HERE THOUGH I UNDERSTAND BUT THE POLICE OR
2488-155524-0011 AN OUTSIDER MIGHT ALLOW SOME OF MY PLANS TO BECOME KNOWN HE PAUSED A MOMENT IN THOUGHT
2488-155524-0012 IT MAY OR MAY NOT INCLUDE THE ACTION WHERE SHE SCRATCHED HERSELF NOW I WANT THE SCENES UP TO THIRTEEN PUT TOGETHER IN PROPER ORDER FIRST AS PHOTOGRAPHED BY ONE CAMERA
2488-155524-0013 OF COURSE I WANT TO DO ANYTHING I CAN UPON ARRIVAL AT THE STUDIO WE DETECTED THIS TIME ALL THE SIGNS OF A COMPLETE DEMORALIZATION THE DEATH OF WERNER
2488-155524-0014 HAD SERVED TO BRING THE TRAGEDY HOME TO THE PEOPLE MORE
2488-155524-0015 HAD TAKEN FORM AND FOUND ITS WAY UNDER THE BIG BLACKENED GLASS ROOFS AND AROUND AND THROUGH THE CORRIDORS
2488-155524-0016 UNEASINESS AS WE DROVE THROUGH THE ARCHWAY INTO THE YARD IN THAT INCLOSURE THERE WERE ONLY TWO CARS MANTON'S AND ONE WE LATER LEARNED BELONGED TO PHELPS THE SOLE HUMAN BEING TO ENTER OUR RANGE OF VISION WAS AN OFFICE BOY
2488-155524-0017 HE SKIRTED THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING AS THOUGH THE MENACE OF DEATH WERE IN THE AIR OR LIKELY TO STRIKE OUT OF THE VERY HEAVENS WITHOUT WARNING WE FOUND KAUF IN THE LARGE STUDIO OBVIOUSLY UNHAPPY IN THE SHOES OF THE UNFORTUNATE WERNER
2488-155524-0018 PROBABLY FROM HALF REASONED OUT MOTIVES OF EFFICIENCY IN PSYCHOLOGY THE NEW DIRECTOR
2488-155524-0019 EXACTLY KAUF BEAMED MISTER MANTON GAVE ME ORDERS TO ASSIST YOU IN EVERY WAY I COULD OR TO PUT ANY OF MY PEOPLE AT YOUR DISPOSAL MORE THAN THAT MISTER KENNEDY HE ANTICIPATED YOU
2488-155524-0020 FIX YOU UP VERY QUICKLY GOOD
2488-155524-0021 NOW WALTER HE EXCLAIMED SOBERING I PICKED UP THE TRAVELING BAG AND TOGETHER WE STROLLED TOWARD THE BALLROOM SET THERE MOST OF THE PLAYERS WERE GATHERED ALREADY IN MAKE UP AND EVENING CLOTHES OF A FANCIER SORT EVEN THAN THOSE DEMANDED FOR THE BANQUET
2488-155524-0022 I SAW THAT KENNEDY SINGLED OUT MARILYN GOOD MORNING SHE SAID CHEERFULLY BUT WITH EFFORT IT WAS OBVIOUS SHE HAD SPENT A NERVOUS NIGHT THERE WERE CIRCLES UNDER HER EYES ILL CONCEALED BY THE SMALL QUANTITY OF COSMETIC SHE USED HER HANDS SHIFTING CONSTANTLY
2488-155524-0023 IN THAT BAG IN WALTER'S HAND IS ONE OF THE STUDIO TOWELS IT CONTAINS A HINT OF THE POISON USED TO KILL MISS LAMAR AND OF UTMOST CONSEQUENCE
2488-155524-0024 IT HAS PROVIDED ME WITH AN INFALLIBLE CLUE TO THE IDENTITY OF THE MURDERER HIMSELF OR HERSELF IT SEEMED TO ME THAT MARILYN BLANCHED WHERE
2488-155524-0025 SHE DEMANDED IN A VERY AWED VOICE IN ONE OF THE STUDIO WASHROOMS IT HAS BEEN IT
2488-155524-0026 NO NOT THAT JAMESON DISCOVERED IT THE SAME DAY BUT THE VERY SLIGHT PAUSE WAS PERCEPTIBLE TO ME KENNEDY HATED TO LIE
2488-155524-0027 ENID FAYE SEEING US FROM A DISTANCE CONQUERED HER DISLIKE OF MARILYN SUFFICIENTLY TO JOIN US SHE WAS VERY ERECT AND TENSE
2488-155524-0028 SOFTENING AS SHE CAME CLOSE TO ME LAYING A HAND ON MY SHOULDER AND ALLOWING HER SKIRT TO BRUSH MY TROUSERS TELL ME JAMIE SHE WHISPERED HER WARM BREATH THRILLING ME THROUGH AND THROUGH HAS THE WONDERFUL CRAIG KENNEDY DISCOVERED SOMETHING
2488-155524-0029 IT WAS NOT SARCASM BUT ASSUMED
2488-155524-0030 MASKING A THROBBING CURIOSITY I FOUND A TOWEL IN ONE OF THE STUDIO WASHROOMS I ANSWERED
2488-155524-0031 ENID GASPED
2488-155524-0032 I CANNOT TELL YOU THAT JUST YET HE PAUSED DELIBERATELY YOU SEE HE LIED I HAVE YET TO MAKE MY ANALYSIS BUT YOU KNOW IT'S A CLUE TO THE THAT TOWEL HE RAISED HIS VOICE AS THOUGH IN ELATION
2488-155524-0033 IF YOU CAN PROVE WHO THE MURDERER IS MISTER KENNEDY HE EXPLODED WHY DON'T YOU APPREHEND HIM BEFORE SOME ONE ELSE MEETS THE FATE OF WERNER I CAN DO NOTHING UNTIL I RETURN TO MY LABORATORY THIS AFTERNOON
2488-155524-0034 I WILL NOT KNOW THE IDENTITY OF THE GUILTY PERSON UNTIL I COMPLETE A CHEMICAL ANALYSIS ONE BY ONE THE VARIOUS PEOPLE POSSIBLY CONCERNED IN THE TWO CRIMES JOINED THE GROUP THIS MORNING ALL THE FACES WERE SERIOUS
2488-155524-0035 MOST OF THEM SHOWED THE MARKS OF SLEEPLESSNESS FOLLOWING THE SECOND MURDER KENNEDY WALKED AWAY BUT I SAW THAT JACK GORDON HASTENED TO QUESTION BOTH THE GIRLS IGNORING THEIR EVIDENT DISLIKE FOR HIM
2488-155524-0036 THE EVIDENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM HAD DRAWN THE EMPLOYEES OF MANTON PICTURES TO THE STUDIO AS A CROWD OF BASEBALL FANS COLLECTS BEFORE A PUBLIC BULLETIN BOARD NOT ONE OF THEM BUT WAS AFRAID OF MISSING SOME DEVELOPMENT IN THE CASE
2488-155524-0037 IN NO INSTANCE COULD THE INTEREST OF A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL BE TAKEN AS AN INDICATION OF GUILT PHELPS ENTERED THE STUDIO FROM THE DOOR TO THE DRESSING ROOMS DISDAINING TO JOIN THE OTHER GROUP HE APPROACHED US TO ASK THE CAUSE FOR THE EXCITEMENT
2488-155524-0038 KENNEDY EXPLAINED PATIENTLY AND I SAW THAT PHELPS LOOKED AT THE BLACK BAG UNEASILY
2488-155524-0039 HE MUTTERED WHY KENNEDY'S MOUTH TIGHTENED THE FINANCIER GREW RED BECAUSE THIS PICTURE HAS BEEN CRIPPLED ENOUGH FIRST A NEW STAR NOW A NEW DIRECTOR
2488-155524-0040 THEN HE TURNED AND HURRIED AWAY OUT OF THE STUDIO GORDON AND MILLARD DETACHED THEMSELVES FROM THE OTHERS COMING OVER IN WHICH WASHROOM WAS THE TOWEL FOUND MISTER KENNEDY GORDON PUT THE QUESTION AS THOUGH HE FELT HIMSELF SPECIALLY DELEGATED TO OBTAIN THIS INFORMATION
2488-155524-0041 THE ONE ON THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE OFFICE BUILDING
2488-155524-0042 MILLARD STILL SMILING TURNED TO SAY SOMETHING TO US
2488-155524-0043 I JUST LEARNED YOU WERE HERE IS IS THERE SOME NEW DEVELOPMENT IS THERE SOMETHING I CAN DO I SEE YOU ARE NOT ALLOWING ANYTHING TO INTERFERE WITH THE MAKING OF THE PICTURE KENNEDY REMARKED ALL THE PEOPLE SEEM TO BE HERE BRIGHT AND EARLY A SHADOW CREPT INTO MANTON'S FACE IT
2488-155524-0044 AS WAR HE ADMITTED BUT I CAN'T HELP MYSELF MISTER KENNEDY THE COMPANY HAS NO MONEY AND IF WE DON'T MEET THIS RELEASE WE'RE BUSTED ALL AT ONCE HE LOWERED HIS VOICE EAGERLY TELL ME HAVE YOU DISCOVERED SOMETHING IS THERE SOME CLUE TO THE GUILTY MAN
2488-155524-0045 HE'S FOUND A TOWEL MILLARD PUT IN AN EXPRESSION OF HALF AMUSEMENT ON HIS FACE AS HE FACED THE PROMOTER
2488-155524-0046 HE SAYS HE FOUND IT IN THE WASHROOM BY OUR OFFICES
2488-155524-0047 SURE OF COURSE MANTON GLANCED ABOUT AND SAW THE LITTLE KNOT OF PEOPLE STILL GATHERED IN THE SET
2488-155524-0048 HE'S LOSING TIME THEN HE TURNED TO US AGAIN COME ON MISTER KENNEDY WE HAVE SOME STEEL LOCKERS OUT BY THE PROPERTY ROOM
