5141-26995-0000 ON THE FOURTEENTH OF APRIL ROMOLA WAS ONCE MORE WITHIN THE WALLS OF FLORENCE UNABLE TO REST AT PISTOJA WHERE CONTRADICTORY REPORTS REACHED HER ABOUT THE TRIAL BY FIRE SHE HAD GONE ON TO PRATO AND WAS BEGINNING TO THINK THAT SHE SHOULD BE DRAWN ON TO FLORENCE IN SPITE OF DREAD
5141-26995-0001 WHEN SHE ENCOUNTERED THAT MONK OF SAN SPIRITO WHO HAD BEEN HER GODFATHER'S CONFESSOR FROM HIM SHE LEARNED THE FULL STORY OF SAVONAROLA'S ARREST AND OF HER HUSBAND'S DEATH
5141-26995-0002 AND HE COULD TELL HER WHAT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN IN FLORENCE THAT TITO HAD ESCAPED FROM AN ASSAULTING MOB BY LEAPING INTO THE ARNO BUT HAD BEEN MURDERED ON THE BANK BY AN OLD MAN WHO HAD LONG HAD AN ENMITY AGAINST HIM BUT ROMOLA UNDERSTOOD THE CATASTROPHE AS NO ONE ELSE DID
5141-26995-0003 OF SAVONAROLA THE MONK TOLD HER IN THAT TONE OF UNFAVOURABLE PREJUDICE WHICH WAS USUAL IN THE BLACK BRETHREN FRATI NERI TOWARDS THE BROTHER WHO SHOWED WHITE UNDER HIS BLACK THAT HE HAD CONFESSED HIMSELF A DECEIVER OF THE PEOPLE ROMOLA PAUSED NO LONGER
5141-26995-0004 THAT EVENING SHE WAS IN FLORENCE SITTING IN AGITATED SILENCE UNDER THE EXCLAMATIONS OF JOY AND WAILING MINGLED WITH EXUBERANT NARRATIVE WHICH WERE POURED INTO HER EARS BY MONNA BRIGIDA WHO HAD BACKSLIDED INTO FALSE HAIR IN ROMOLA'S ABSENCE
5141-26995-0005 BUT NOW DREW IT OFF AGAIN AND DECLARED SHE WOULD NOT MIND BEING GREY IF HER DEAR CHILD WOULD STAY WITH HER ROMOLA WAS TOO DEEPLY MOVED BY THE MAIN EVENTS WHICH SHE HAD KNOWN BEFORE COMING TO FLORENCE TO BE WROUGHT UPON BY THE DOUBTFUL GOSSIPING DETAILS ADDED IN BRIGIDA'S NARRATIVE
5141-26995-0006 THE TRAGEDY OF HER HUSBAND'S DEATH OF FRA GIROLAMO'S CONFESSION OF DUPLICITY UNDER THE COERCION OF TORTURE LEFT HER HARDLY ANY POWER OF APPREHENDING MINOR CIRCUMSTANCES
5141-26995-0007 TO TRY AND SEE SAVONAROLA AND TO LEARN WHAT HAD BECOME OF TESSA AND THE CHILDREN TELL ME COUSIN SHE SAID ABRUPTLY WHEN MONNA BRIGIDA'S TONGUE HAD RUN QUITE AWAY FROM TROUBLES INTO PROJECTS OF ROMOLA'S LIVING WITH HER
5141-26995-0008 HAS ANYTHING BEEN SEEN OR SAID SINCE TITO'S DEATH OF A YOUNG WOMAN WITH TWO LITTLE CHILDREN BRIGIDA STARTED ROUNDED HER EYES AND LIFTED UP HER HANDS CRISTO NO WHAT WAS HE SO BAD AS THAT MY POOR CHILD
5141-26995-0009 AH THEN THAT WAS WHY YOU WENT AWAY AND LEFT ME WORD ONLY THAT YOU WENT OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL WELL WELL IF I'D KNOWN THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT YOU SO STRANGE AND FLIGHTY FOR I DID SAY TO MYSELF THOUGH I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY ELSE
5141-26995-0010 BARDO WAS FIERCE YOU CAN'T DENY IT BUT IF YOU HAD ONLY TOLD ME THE TRUTH THAT THERE WAS A YOUNG HUSSEY AND CHILDREN I SHOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT ALL ANYTHING SEEN OR SAID OF HER NO AND THE LESS THE BETTER THEY SAY ENOUGH OF ILL ABOUT HIM WITHOUT THAT
5141-26995-0011 BUT SINCE THAT WAS THE REASON YOU WENT NO DEAR COUSIN SAID ROMOLA INTERRUPTING HER EARNESTLY PRAY DO NOT TALK SO I WISH ABOVE ALL THINGS TO FIND THAT YOUNG WOMAN AND HER CHILDREN AND TO TAKE CARE OF THEM THEY ARE QUITE HELPLESS SAY NOTHING AGAINST IT
5141-26995-0012 THAT IS THE THING I SHALL DO FIRST OF ALL WELL SAID MONNA BRIGIDA SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS AND LOWERING HER VOICE WITH AN AIR OF PUZZLED DISCOMFITURE IF THAT'S BEING A PIAGNONE I'VE BEEN TAKING PEAS FOR PATERNOSTERS
5141-26995-0013 WHY FRA GIROLAMO SAID AS GOOD AS THAT WIDOWS OUGHT NOT TO MARRY AGAIN STEP IN AT THE DOOR AND IT'S A SIN AND A SHAME IT SEEMS BUT COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND YOU'RE WELCOME TWO CHILDREN SANTIDDIO COUSIN
5141-26995-0014 THE POOR THING HAS DONE NO CONSCIOUS WRONG SHE IS IGNORANT OF EVERYTHING I WILL TELL YOU BUT NOT NOW EARLY THE NEXT MORNING ROMOLA'S STEPS WERE DIRECTED TO THE HOUSE BEYOND SAN AMBROGIO WHERE SHE HAD ONCE FOUND TESSA
5141-26995-0015 BUT IT WAS AS SHE HAD FEARED TESSA WAS GONE ROMOLA CONJECTURED THAT TITO HAD SENT HER AWAY BEFOREHAND TO SOME SPOT WHERE HE HAD INTENDED TO JOIN HER FOR SHE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD WILLINGLY PART WITH THOSE CHILDREN IT WAS A PAINFUL CONJECTURE BECAUSE
5141-26995-0016 IF TESSA WERE OUT OF FLORENCE THERE WAS HARDLY A CHANCE OF FINDING HER AND ROMOLA PICTURED THE CHILDISH CREATURE WAITING AND WAITING AT SOME WAYSIDE SPOT IN WONDERING HELPLESS MISERY THOSE WHO LIVED NEAR COULD TELL HER NOTHING EXCEPT THAT OLD DEAF LISA
5141-26995-0017 HAD GONE AWAY A WEEK AGO WITH HER GOODS BUT NO ONE KNEW WHERE TESSA HAD GONE ROMOLA SAW NO FURTHER ACTIVE SEARCH OPEN TO HER FOR SHE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE THAT COULD SERVE AS A STARTING POINT FOR INQUIRY
5141-26995-0018 AND NOT ONLY HER INNATE RESERVE BUT A MORE NOBLE SENSITIVENESS MADE HER SHRINK FROM ASSUMING AN ATTITUDE OF GENEROSITY IN THE EYES OF OTHERS BY PUBLISHING TESSA'S RELATION TO TITO ALONG WITH HER OWN DESIRE TO FIND HER MANY DAYS PASSED IN ANXIOUS INACTION
5141-26995-0019 EVEN UNDER STRONG SOLICITATION FROM OTHER THOUGHTS ROMOLA FOUND HER HEART PALPITATING IF SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A PAIR OF ROUND BROWN LEGS OR OF A SHORT WOMAN IN THE CONTADINA DRESS SHE NEVER FOR A MOMENT TOLD HERSELF THAT IT WAS HEROISM OR EXALTED CHARITY IN HER TO SEEK THESE BEINGS
5141-26995-0020 SHE NEEDED SOMETHING THAT SHE WAS BOUND SPECIALLY TO CARE FOR SHE YEARNED TO CLASP THE CHILDREN AND TO MAKE THEM LOVE HER THIS AT LEAST WOULD BE SOME SWEET RESULT FOR OTHERS AS WELL AS HERSELF FROM ALL HER PAST SORROW
5141-26995-0021 IT APPEARED THERE WAS MUCH PROPERTY OF TITO'S TO WHICH SHE HAD A CLAIM BUT SHE DISTRUSTED THE CLEANNESS OF THAT MONEY AND SHE HAD DETERMINED TO MAKE IT ALL OVER TO THE STATE EXCEPT SO MUCH AS WAS EQUAL TO THE PRICE OF HER FATHER'S LIBRARY THIS WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE MODEST SUPPORT OF TESSA AND THE CHILDREN
5141-26995-0022 BUT MONNA BRIGIDA THREW SUCH PLANNING INTO THE BACKGROUND BY CLAMOROUSLY INSISTING THAT ROMOLA MUST LIVE WITH HER AND NEVER FORSAKE HER TILL SHE HAD SEEN HER SAFE IN PARADISE ELSE WHY HAD SHE PERSUADED HER TO TURN PIAGNONE AND IF ROMOLA WANTED TO REAR OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN
5141-26995-0023 SHE MONNA BRIGIDA MUST REAR THEM TOO ONLY THEY MUST BE FOUND FIRST ROMOLA FELT THE FULL FORCE OF THAT INNUENDO BUT STRONG FEELING UNSATISFIED IS NEVER WITHOUT ITS SUPERSTITION EITHER OF HOPE OR DESPAIR ROMOLA'S WAS THE SUPERSTITION OF HOPE
5141-26995-0024 SOMEHOW SHE WAS TO FIND THAT MOTHER AND THE CHILDREN AND AT LAST ANOTHER DIRECTION FOR ACTIVE INQUIRY SUGGESTED ITSELF SHE LEARNED THAT TITO HAD PROVIDED HORSES AND MULES TO AWAIT HIM IN SAN GALLO HE WAS THEREFORE GOING TO LEAVE FLORENCE BY THE GATE OF SAN GALLO
5141-26995-0025 AND SHE DETERMINED THOUGH WITHOUT MUCH CONFIDENCE IN THE ISSUE TO TRY AND ASCERTAIN FROM THE GATEKEEPERS IF THEY HAD OBSERVED ANY ONE CORRESPONDING TO THE DESCRIPTION OF TESSA WITH HER CHILDREN TO HAVE PASSED THE GATES BEFORE THE MORNING OF THE NINTH OF APRIL
5141-26995-0026 WALKING ALONG THE VIA SAN GALLO AND LOOKING WATCHFULLY ABOUT HER THROUGH HER LONG WIDOW'S VEIL LEST SHE SHOULD MISS ANY OBJECT THAT MIGHT AID HER SHE DESCRIED BRATTI CHAFFERING WITH A CUSTOMER THAT ROAMING MAN SHE THOUGHT MIGHT AID HER SHE WOULD NOT MIND TALKING OF TESSA TO HIM
5141-26995-0027 BUT AS SHE PUT ASIDE HER VEIL AND CROSSED THE STREET TOWARDS HIM SHE SAW SOMETHING HANGING FROM THE CORNER OF HIS BASKET WHICH MADE HER HEART LEAP WITH A MUCH STRONGER HOPE BRATTI MY FRIEND SHE SAID ABRUPTLY WHERE DID YOU GET THAT NECKLACE YOUR SERVANT MADONNA
5141-26995-0028 SAID BRATTI LOOKING ROUND AT HER VERY DELIBERATELY HIS MIND NOT BEING SUBJECT TO SURPRISE IT'S A NECKLACE WORTH MONEY BUT I SHALL GET LITTLE BY IT FOR MY HEART'S TOO TENDER FOR A TRADER'S I HAVE PROMISED TO KEEP IT IN PLEDGE PRAY TELL ME WHERE YOU GOT IT
5141-26995-0029 FROM A LITTLE WOMAN NAMED TESSA IS IT NOT TRUE AH IF YOU KNOW HER SAID BRATTI AND WOULD REDEEM IT OF ME AT A SMALL PROFIT AND GIVE IT HER AGAIN YOU'D BE DOING A CHARITY FOR SHE CRIED AT PARTING WITH IT YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT SHE WAS RUNNING INTO A BROOK
5141-26995-0030 IT'S A SMALL PROFIT I'LL CHARGE YOU YOU SHALL HAVE IT FOR A FLORIN FOR I DON'T LIKE TO BE HARD HEARTED WHERE IS SHE SAID ROMOLA GIVING HIM THE MONEY AND UNCLASPING THE NECKLACE FROM THE BASKET IN JOYFUL AGITATION OUTSIDE THE GATE THERE AT THE OTHER END OF THE BORGO
5141-26995-0031 AT OLD SIBILLA MANETTI'S ANYBODY WILL TELL YOU WHICH IS THE HOUSE ROMOLA WENT ALONG WITH WINGED FEET BLESSING THAT INCIDENT OF THE CARNIVAL WHICH HAD MADE HER LEARN BY HEART THE APPEARANCE OF THIS NECKLACE SOON SHE WAS AT THE HOUSE SHE SOUGHT
5141-26995-0032 HAD NO MONEY ONLY THEIR CLOTHES TO PAY A POOR WIDOW WITH FOR THEIR FOOD AND LODGING BUT SINCE MADONNA KNEW THEM ROMOLA WAITED TO HEAR NO MORE BUT OPENED THE DOOR TESSA WAS SEATED ON THE LOW BED
5141-26995-0033 HER CRYING HAD PASSED INTO TEARLESS SOBS AND SHE WAS LOOKING WITH SAD BLANK EYES AT THE TWO CHILDREN WHO WERE PLAYING IN AN OPPOSITE CORNER LILLO COVERING HIS HEAD WITH HIS SKIRT AND ROARING AT NINNA TO FRIGHTEN HER THEN PEEPING OUT AGAIN TO SEE HOW SHE BORE IT
5141-26995-0034 THE DOOR WAS A LITTLE BEHIND TESSA
5141-26995-0035 EXPECTATION WAS NO LONGER ALIVE ROMOLA HAD THROWN ASIDE HER VEIL AND PAUSED A MOMENT HOLDING THE NECKLACE IN SIGHT THEN SHE SAID IN THAT PURE VOICE THAT USED TO CHEER HER FATHER TESSA TESSA STARTED TO HER FEET AND LOOKED ROUND
5141-26995-0036 SEE SAID ROMOLA CLASPING THE BEADS ON TESSA'S NECK GOD HAS SENT ME TO YOU AGAIN THE POOR THING SCREAMED AND SOBBED AND CLUNG TO THE ARMS THAT FASTENED THE NECKLACE SHE COULD NOT SPEAK
5141-26995-0037 THE TWO CHILDREN CAME FROM THEIR CORNER LAID HOLD OF THEIR MOTHER'S SKIRTS AND LOOKED UP WITH WIDE EYES AT ROMOLA THAT DAY THEY ALL WENT HOME TO MONNA BRIGIDA'S IN THE BORGO DEGLI ALBIZZI ROMOLA HAD MADE KNOWN TO TESSA BY GENTLE DEGREES
5141-26995-0038 THAT NALDO COULD NEVER COME TO HER AGAIN NOT BECAUSE HE WAS CRUEL BUT BECAUSE HE WAS DEAD BUT BE COMFORTED MY TESSA SAID ROMOLA I AM COME TO TAKE CARE OF YOU ALWAYS AND WE HAVE GOT LILLO AND NINNA
5141-26995-0039 MONNA BRIGIDA'S MOUTH TWITCHED IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN HER AWE OF ROMOLA AND THE DESIRE TO SPEAK UNSEASONABLY LET BE FOR THE PRESENT SHE THOUGHT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME A THOUSAND YEARS TILL I TELL THIS LITTLE CONTADINA
5141-26995-0040 WHO SEEMS NOT TO KNOW HOW MANY FINGERS SHE'S GOT ON HER HAND WHO ROMOLA IS AND I WILL TELL HER SOME DAY ELSE SHE'LL NEVER KNOW HER PLACE IT'S ALL VERY WELL FOR ROMOLA NOBODY WILL CALL THEIR SOULS THEIR OWN WHEN SHE'S BY
5141-26995-0041 BUT IF I'M TO HAVE THIS PUSS FACED MINX LIVING IN MY HOUSE SHE MUST BE HUMBLE TO ME
