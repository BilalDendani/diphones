5199-36965-0000 A STORMY NIGHT WHEN TOBY AWOKE IT WAS NEARLY DARK AND THE BUSTLE AROUND HIM TOLD VERY PLAINLY THAT THE TIME FOR DEPARTURE WAS NEAR AT HAND HE RUBBED HIS EYES JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT HE WAS THOROUGHLY AWAKE
5199-36965-0001 AND THEN JUMPED DOWN FROM HIS RATHER LOFTY BED AND RAN AROUND TO THE DOOR OF THE CAGE TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT MISTER STUBBS WAS SAFE THIS DONE HIS PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY WERE MADE NOW
5199-36965-0002 TOBY NOTICED THAT EACH ONE OF THE DRIVERS WAS CLAD IN RUBBER CLOTHING AND AFTER LISTENING FOR A MOMENT HE LEARNED THE CAUSE OF THEIR WATER PROOF GARMENTS IT WAS RAINING VERY HARD AND TOBY THOUGHT WITH DISMAY OF THE LONG RIDE
5199-36965-0003 WITH NO PROTECTION WHATEVER SAVE THAT AFFORDED BY HIS ORDINARY CLOTHING WHILE HE WAS STANDING BY THE SIDE OF THE WAGON WONDERING HOW HE SHOULD GET ALONG OLD BEN CAME IN THE WATER WAS POURING FROM HIS CLOTHES IN LITTLE RIVULETS
5199-36965-0004 AND HE AFFORDED MOST UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCE OF THE DAMP STATE OF THE WEATHER IT'S A NASTY NIGHT MY BOY SAID THE OLD DRIVER IN MUCH THE SAME CHEERY TONE THAT HE WOULD HAVE USED HAD HE BEEN INFORMING TOBY THAT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MOONLIGHT EVENING
5199-36965-0005 I GUESS I'LL GET WET SAID TOBY RUEFULLY AS HE LOOKED UP AT THE LOFTY SEAT WHICH HE WAS TO OCCUPY BLESS ME SAID BEN AS IF THE THOUGHT HAD JUST COME TO HIM IT WON'T DO FOR YOU TO RIDE OUTSIDE ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS
5199-36965-0006 YOU WAIT HERE AN I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU THE OLD MAN HURRIED OFF TO THE OTHER END OF THE TENT AND ALMOST BEFORE TOBY THOUGHT HE HAD TIME TO GO AS FAR AS THE RING HE RETURNED
5199-36965-0007 IT'S ALL RIGHT HE SAID AND THIS TIME IN A GRUFF VOICE AS IF HE WERE ANNOUNCING SOME MISFORTUNE YOU'RE TO RIDE IN THE WOMEN'S WAGON COME WITH ME
5199-36965-0008 TOBY FOLLOWED WITHOUT A QUESTION THOUGH HE WAS WHOLLY AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WOMEN'S WAGON WAS
5199-36965-0009 HE SOON LEARNED HOWEVER WHEN OLD BEN STOPPED IN FRONT OR RATHER AT THE END OF A LONG COVERED WAGON THAT LOOKED LIKE AN OMNIBUS EXCEPT THAT IT WAS CONSIDERABLY LONGER AND THE SEATS INSIDE WERE DIVIDED BY ARMS PADDED TO MAKE THEM COMFORTABLE TO LEAN AGAINST
5199-36965-0010 HERE'S THE BOY SAID BEN AS HE LIFTED TOBY UP ON THE STEP GAVE HIM A GENTLE PUSH TO INTIMATE THAT HE WAS TO GET INSIDE AND THEN LEFT HIM
5199-36965-0011 AS TOBY STEPPED INSIDE HE SAW THAT THE WAGON WAS NEARLY FULL OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND FEARING LEST HE SHOULD TAKE A SEAT THAT BELONGED TO SOME ONE ELSE HE STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WAGON NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO
5199-36965-0012 WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN LITTLE BOY ASKED ONE OF THE LADIES AFTER TOBY HAD REMAINED STANDING NEARLY FIVE MINUTES AND THE WAGON WAS ABOUT TO START WELL SAID TOBY WITH SOME HESITATION AS HE LOOKED AROUND AT THE TWO OR THREE EMPTY SEATS THAT REMAINED
5199-36965-0013 COME RIGHT HERE SAID THE LADY AS SHE POINTED TO A SEAT BY THE SIDE OF A LITTLE GIRL WHO DID NOT LOOK ANY OLDER THAN TOBY THE LADY WHO USUALLY OCCUPIES THAT SEAT WILL NOT BE HERE TO NIGHT AND YOU CAN HAVE IT THANK YOU MA'AM
5199-36965-0014 SAID TOBY AS HE SAT TIMIDLY DOWN ON THE EDGE OF THE SEAT HARDLY DARING TO SIT BACK COMFORTABLY AND FEELING VERY AWKWARD
5199-36965-0015 BUT CONGRATULATING HIMSELF ON BEING THUS PROTECTED FROM THE POURING RAIN THE WAGON STARTED AND AS EACH ONE TALKED WITH HER NEIGHBOR TOBY FELT A MOST DISMAL SENSE OF LONELINESS AND ALMOST WISHED THAT HE WAS RIDING ON THE MONKEY CART WITH BEN
5199-36965-0016 WHERE HE COULD HAVE SOME ONE TO TALK WITH HE GRADUALLY PUSHED HIMSELF BACK INTO A MORE COMFORTABLE POSITION
5199-36965-0017 SHE WAS QUITE AS YOUNG AS TOBY AND SMALL OF HER AGE BUT THERE WAS AN OLD LOOK ABOUT HER FACE THAT MADE THE BOY THINK OF HER AS BEING AN OLD WOMAN CUT DOWN TO FIT CHILDREN'S CLOTHES TOBY HAD LOOKED AT HER SO EARNESTLY THAT SHE OBSERVED HIM AND ASKED
5199-36965-0018 WHAT IS YOUR NAME TOBY TYLER WHAT DO YOU DO IN THE CIRCUS SELL CANDY FOR MISTER LORD
5199-36965-0019 TOBY KNEW BY THE TONE OF HER VOICE THAT HE HAD FALLEN CONSIDERABLY IN HER ESTIMATION BY NOT BEING ONE OF THE PERFORMERS AND IT WAS SOME LITTLE TIME BEFORE HE VENTURED TO SPEAK AND THEN HE ASKED TIMIDLY WHAT DO YOU DO
5199-36965-0020 FOUR HORSES ASKED TOBY IN AWE THAT HE SHOULD BE CONVERSING WITH SO FAMOUS A PERSON
5199-36965-0021 AND ABOUT MISTER STUBBS AND IN RETURN HAD TOLD HIM THAT HER NAME WAS ELLA MASON THOUGH ON THE BILLS SHE WAS CALLED MADEMOISELLE JEANNETTE
5199-36965-0022 MADEMOISELLE JEANNETTE CURLED HERSELF UP ON THE SEAT WITH HER HEAD IN HER MOTHER'S LAP AND WENT TO SLEEP TOBY HAD RESOLVED TO KEEP AWAKE AND WATCH HER FOR HE WAS STRUCK WITH ADMIRATION AT HER FACE
5199-36965-0023 BUT SLEEP GOT THE BETTER OF HIM IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MADE THE RESOLUTION AND HE SAT BOLT UPRIGHT WITH HIS LITTLE ROUND HEAD NODDING AND BOBBING UNTIL IT SEEMED ALMOST CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD SHAKE IT OFF
5199-36965-0024 WHEN TOBY AWOKE THE WAGON WAS DRAWN UP BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THE SUN WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY PREPARATIONS WERE BEING MADE FOR THE ENTREE INTO TOWN AND THE HARSH VOICE OF MISTER JOB LORD
5199-36965-0025 WHEN HE SHOULD MAKE HIS APPEARANCE TOBY WOULD HAVE HESITATED BEFORE MEETING HIS ANGRY EMPLOYER BUT THAT HE KNEW IT WOULD ONLY MAKE MATTERS WORSE FOR HIM WHEN HE DID SHOW HIMSELF AND HE MENTALLY BRACED HIMSELF FOR THE TROUBLE WHICH HE KNEW WAS COMING
5199-36965-0026 THE LITTLE GIRL WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE HE HAD MADE THE NIGHT PREVIOUS WAS STILL SLEEPING AND WISHING TO SAY GOOD BYE TO HER IN SOME WAY WITHOUT AWAKENING HER HE STOOPED DOWN AND GENTLY KISSED THE SKIRT OF HER DRESS THEN HE WENT OUT TO MEET HIS MASTER
5199-36965-0027 MISTER LORD WAS THOROUGHLY ENRAGED WHEN TOBY LEFT THE WAGON AND SAW THE BOY JUST AS HE STEPPED TO THE GROUND THE ANGRY MAN GAVE A QUICK GLANCE AROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT NONE OF TOBY'S FRIENDS WERE IN SIGHT
5199-36965-0028 WITH THE SMALL RUBBER CANE THAT HE USUALLY CARRIED MISTER JOB LORD LIFTED THE POOR BOY ENTIRELY CLEAR OF THE GROUND AND EACH BLOW THAT HE STRUCK COULD BE HEARD ALMOST THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CIRCUS TRAIN
5199-36965-0029 YOU'VE BEEN MAKIN SO MANY ACQUAINTANCES HERE THAT YOU HAIN'T WILLIN TO DO ANY WORK HE SAID SAVAGELY AS HE REDOUBLED THE FORCE OF HIS BLOWS OH PLEASE STOP PLEASE STOP SHRIEKED THE POOR BOY IN HIS AGONY
5199-36965-0030 I'LL DO EVERYTHING YOU TELL ME TO IF YOU WON'T STRIKE ME AGAIN THIS PITEOUS APPEAL SEEMED TO HAVE NO EFFECT UPON THE CRUEL MAN AND HE CONTINUED TO WHIP THE BOY DESPITE HIS CRIES AND ENTREATIES UNTIL HIS ARM FAIRLY ACHED FROM THE EXERTION
5199-36965-0031 AND TOBY'S BODY WAS CROSSED AND RECROSSED WITH THE LIVID MARKS OF THE CANE NOW LET'S SEE WHETHER YOU'LL TEND TO YOUR WORK OR NOT SAID THE MAN AS HE FLUNG TOBY FROM HIM
5199-36965-0032 WITH SUCH FORCE THAT THE BOY STAGGERED REELED AND NEARLY FELL INTO THE LITTLE BROOK THAT FLOWED BY THE ROADSIDE I'LL MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ALL THE FRIENDS YOU'VE WHINED AROUND IN THIS SHOW CAN'T SAVE YOU FROM A LICKIN WHEN I GET READY TO GIVE YOU ONE
5199-36965-0033 NOW GO AN DO YOUR WORK THAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DONE AN HOUR AGO MISTER LORD WALKED AWAY WITH THE PROUD CONSCIOUSNESS OF A MAN WHO HAS ACHIEVED A GREAT VICTORY AND TOBY WAS LIMPING PAINFULLY ALONG TOWARD THE CART THAT WAS USED IN CONVEYING MISTER LORD'S STOCK IN TRADE
5199-36965-0034 AND HEARD A CHILDISH VOICE SAY DON'T CRY TOBY SOME TIME WHEN I GET BIG ENOUGH
5199-36965-0035 LOOKING AROUND TOBY SAW HIS LITTLE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE EVENING PREVIOUS AND HE TRIED TO FORCE BACK THE BIG TEARS THAT WERE ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS AS HE SAID IN A VOICE CHOKED WITH GRIEF
5199-36965-0036 DID IT HURT YOU MUCH SHE ASKED FEELINGLY
5199-36965-0037 BUT IT DON'T A BIT NOW THAT YOU'VE COME THEN I'LL GO AND TALK TO THAT MISTER LORD AND I'LL COME AND SEE YOU AGAIN AFTER WE GET INTO TOWN SAID THE LITTLE MISS AS SHE HURRIED AWAY TO TELL THE CANDY VENDER WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF HIM
5199-36965-0038 THAT DAY AS ON ALL OTHERS SINCE HE HAD BEEN WITH THE CIRCUS TOBY WENT TO HIS WORK WITH A HEAVY HEART AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN DID HE COUNT THE MONEY
5199-36965-0039 THREE DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS WAS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF HIS TREASURE AND LARGE AS THAT SUM APPEARED TO HIM HE COULD NOT SATISFY HIMSELF THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE HIM TO GET BACK TO THE HOME WHICH HE HAD SO WICKEDLY LEFT
5199-36965-0040 WHENEVER HE THOUGHT OF THIS HOME OF THE UNCLE DANIEL WHO HAD IN CHARITY CARED FOR HIM A MOTHERLESS FATHERLESS BOY AND OF RETURNING TO IT WITH NOT EVEN AS MUCH RIGHT AS THE PRODIGAL SON OF WHOM HE HAD HEARD UNCLE DANIEL TELL
5199-36965-0041 HIS HEART SUNK WITHIN HIM
5199-36965-0042 THIS DAY PASSED SO FAR AS TOBY WAS CONCERNED VERY MUCH AS HAD THE OTHERS HE COULD NOT SATISFY EITHER OF HIS EMPLOYERS TRY AS HARD AS HE MIGHT BUT AS USUAL HE MET WITH TWO OR THREE KINDLY DISPOSED PEOPLE
5199-36965-0043 WHO ADDED TO THE FUND THAT HE WAS ACCUMULATING FOR HIS SECOND VENTURE OF RUNNING AWAY BY LITTLE GIFTS OF MONEY
5199-36965-0044 DURING THE ENTIRE WEEK HE WAS THUS EQUALLY FORTUNATE EACH DAY ADDED SOMETHING TO HIS FUND AND EACH NIGHT IT SEEMED TO TOBY THAT HE WAS ONE DAY NEARER THE FREEDOM FOR WHICH HE SO ARDENTLY LONGED
5199-36965-0045 THE SKELETON THE FAT LADY OLD BEN THE ALBINO CHILDREN LITTLE ELLA AND EVEN THE SWORD SWALLOWER ALL GAVE HIM A KINDLY WORD
5199-36965-0046 OR SAW HIM AS THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE GRAND ENTREE WERE BEING MADE THE TIME HAD PASSED SLOWLY TO TOBY AND YET SUNDAY CAME AGAIN AS SUNDAYS ALWAYS COME AND ON THIS DAY OLD BEN HUNTED HIM UP
5199-36965-0047 MADE HIM WASH HIS FACE AND HANDS UNTIL THEY FAIRLY SHONE FROM VERY CLEANLINESS AND THEN TOOK HIM TO CHURCH TOBY WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT IT WAS REALLY A PLEASANT THING TO BE ABLE TO GO TO CHURCH AFTER BEING DEPRIVED OF IT
5199-36965-0048 THE SKELETON HAD INVITED HIM TO ANOTHER DINNER PARTY BUT TOBY HAD DECLINED THE INVITATION AGREEING TO PRESENT HIMSELF IN TIME FOR SUPPER INSTEAD HE HARDLY CARED TO GO THROUGH THE ORDEAL OF ANOTHER STATE DINNER AND BESIDES
5199-36965-0049 HE WANTED TO GO OFF TO THE WOODS WITH THE OLD MONKEY WHERE HE COULD ENJOY THE SILENCE OF THE FOREST WHICH SEEMED LIKE A FRIEND TO HIM BECAUSE IT REMINDED HIM OF HOME
