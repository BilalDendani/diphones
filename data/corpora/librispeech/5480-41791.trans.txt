5480-41791-0000 COUSIN ANN MOTHER CAREY NOT WISHING TO MAKE ANY LARGER NUMBER OF PERSONS UNCOMFORTABLE THAN NECESSARY HAD ASKED JULIA NOT TO COME TO THEM UNTIL AFTER THE HOUSE IN BEULAH HAD BEEN PUT TO RIGHTS BUT THE FERGUSONS WENT ABROAD RATHER UNEXPECTEDLY
5480-41791-0001 AND MISTER FERGUSON TORE JULIA FROM THE ARMS OF GLADYS AND PUT HER ON THE TRAIN WITH VERY LITTLE FORMALITY HER MEETING COUSIN ANN ON THE WAY WAS MERELY ONE OF THOSE UNPLEASANT COINCIDENCES WITH WHICH LIFE IS FILLED ALTHOUGH IT IS HARDLY POSSIBLE USUALLY
5480-41791-0002 FOR TWO SUCH DISAGREEABLE PERSONS TO BE ON THE SAME SMALL SPOT AT THE SAME PRECISE MOMENT ON THE THIRD MORNING AFTER THE CAREYS ARRIVAL HOWEVER MATTERS ASSUMED A MORE HOPEFUL ATTITUDE FOR COUSIN ANN BECAME DISCONTENTED WITH BEULAH
5480-41791-0003 THE WEATHER HAD TURNED COLD AND THE FIREPLACES SO LONG UNUSED WERE UNIFORMLY SMOKY COUSIN ANN'S STOMACH ALWAYS DELICATE TURNED FROM TINNED MEATS EGGS THREE TIMES A DAY AND SODA BISCUITS MADE BY BILL HARMON'S WIFE
5480-41791-0004 ON WHICH THE CHILDREN THRIVED SO SHE WENT TO THE SO CALLED HOTEL FOR HER MEALS HER REMARKS TO THE LANDLADY AFTER TWO DINNERS AND ONE SUPPER WERE OF A CHARACTER NOT TO BE ENDURED BY ANY OUTSPOKEN
5480-41791-0005 WAS THE IRATE MISSUS BUCK'S ULTIMATUM I'LL FEED YOU SHE CONTINUED PASSIONATELY BECAUSE IT'S MY BUSINESS TO PUT UP AND TAKE IN ANYTHING THAT'S RESPECTABLE BUT I WON'T TAKE NONE O YOUR SASS WELL COUSIN ANN'S TEMPER WAS UP TOO BY THIS TIME
5480-41791-0006 AND SHE DECLINED ON HER PART TO TAKE ANY OF THE LANDLADY'S SASS SO THEY PARTED RATHER TO MISSUS CAREY'S EMBARRASSMENT AS SHE DID NOT WISH TO MAKE ENEMIES AT THE OUTSET THAT NIGHT COUSIN ANN
5480-41791-0007 STILL SMARTING UNDER THE MEMORY OF MISSUS BUCK'S SNAPPING EYES HIGH COLOR AND UNBRIDLED TONGUE COMPLAINED AFTER SUPPER THAT HER BEDSTEAD ROCKED WHENEVER SHE MOVED AND ASKED GILBERT IF HE COULD READJUST IT IN SOME WAY SO THAT IT SHOULD BE AS STATIONARY AS BEDS USUALLY ARE IN A NORMAL STATE
5480-41791-0008 HE TOOK HIS TOOL BASKET AND WENT UPSTAIRS OBEDIENTLY SPENDING FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES WITH THE MUCH CRITICISED ARTICLE OF FURNITURE WHICH HE SUSPECTED OF ROCKING MERELY BECAUSE IT COULDN'T BEAR COUSIN ANN
5480-41791-0009 THIS IDEA SO DELIGHTED NANCY THAT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO RETIRE FROM GILBERT'S PROXIMITY LEST THE FAMILY SHOULD OBSERVE HER MIRTH AND GILBERT'S AND IMPUTE UNDUE IMPORTANCE TO IT I'VE DONE EVERYTHING TO THE BEDSTEAD I CAN THINK OF GILBERT SAID ON COMING DOWNSTAIRS
5480-41791-0010 YOU CAN SEE HOW IT WORKS TO NIGHT COUSIN ANN AS A MATTER OF FACT IT DID WORK INSTEAD OF REMAINING IN PERFECT QUIET AS A WELL BRED BEDSTEAD SHOULD WHEN THE FAMILY WAS SOUND ASLEEP AT MIDNIGHT A LOUD CRASH WAS HEARD AND COUSIN ANN
5480-41791-0011 THROWING OPEN THE DOOR OF HER ROOM SPEEDILY INFORMED EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE THAT HER BED HAD COME DOWN WITH HER GIVING HER NERVES A SHOCK FROM WHICH THEY PROBABLY WOULD NEVER RECOVER GILBERT IS FAR TOO YOUNG FOR THE RESPONSIBILITIES YOU PUT UPON HIM MARGARET COUSIN ANN EXCLAIMED
5480-41791-0012 DRAWING HER WRAPPER MORE CLOSELY OVER HER TALL SPARE FIGURE AND IF HE WAS AS OLD AS METHUSELAH HE WOULD STILL BE CARELESS FOR HE WAS BORN SO ALL THIS TALK ABOUT HIS BEING SKILFUL WITH TOOLS HAS ONLY SWOLLEN HIS VANITY A BOY OF HIS AGE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE A BEDSTEAD STAY TOGETHER
5480-41791-0013 THE WHOLE FAMILY INCLUDING THE CRESTFALLEN GILBERT PROPOSED VARIOUS PLANS OF RELIEF ALL EXCEPT NANCY WHO DID NOT WISH TO MEET GILBERT'S GLANCE FOR FEAR THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE TO SUSPECT HIM OF A NEW CRIME HAVING EMBARKED ON A CAREER OF VILLAINY UNDER HER DIRECT INSTIGATION
5480-41791-0014 SHE DID NOT BELIEVE HIM GUILTY BUT SHE PREFERRED NOT TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER MORE CLOSELY MOTHER CAREY'S EYES SEARCHED GILBERT'S BUT FOUND THERE NO CONFIRMATION OF HER FEARS YOU NEEDN'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT MOTHER SAID THE BOY
5480-41791-0015 THOUGH I'D LIKE HER TO HAVE A LITTLE ONE EVERY NIGHT JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT COUSIN ANN REFUSED TO LET GILBERT TRY AGAIN ON THE BEDSTEAD AND REFUSED PART OF MISSUS CAREY'S BED PREFERRING TO SLEEP ON TWO HAIR MATTRESSES LAID ON HER BEDROOM FLOOR THEY MAY NOT BE COMFORTABLE
5480-41791-0016 SHE SAID TERSELY BUT AT LEAST THEY WILL NOT ENDANGER MY LIFE THE NEXT MORNING'S POST BROUGHT BUSINESS LETTERS AND COUSIN ANN FEARED SHE WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE BEULAH ALTHOUGH THERE WAS WORK FOR A FORTNIGHT TO COME RIGHT THERE AND MARGARET HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO GET THROUGH IT ALONE
5480-41791-0017 AND DIDN'T BELIEVE THE KITCHEN STOVE WOULD EVER DRAW SHE WAS SURE THAT THERE WERE DEAD TOADS AND FROGS IN THE WELL THE HOUSE WAS INCONVENIENT AND ALWAYS WOULD BE TILL WATER WAS BROUGHT INTO THE KITCHEN SINK
5480-41791-0018 THEN SHE PACKED HER SMALL TRUNK AND GILBERT RAN TO THE VILLAGE ON GLAD AND WINGED FEET TO GET SOME ONE TO TAKE HIS DEPRESSING RELATIVE TO THE NOON TRAIN TO BOSTON AS FOR NANCY SHE STOOD IN FRONT OF THE PARLOR FIREPLACE
5480-41791-0019 AND WHEN SHE HEARD THE HOOT OF THE ENGINE IN THE DISTANCE SHE REMOVED THE FOUR MORTUARY VASES FROM THE MANTELPIECE AND TOOK THEM TO THE ATTIC WHILE GILBERT FROM THE UPPER HALL WAS CHANTING A FAVORITE OLD RHYME SHE CALLED US NAMES TILL SHE WAS TIRED SHE CALLED US NAMES TILL WE PERSPIRED
5480-41791-0020 SHE CALLED US NAMES WE NEVER COULD SPELL SHE CALLED US NAMES WE NEVER MAY TELL SHE CALLED US NAMES THAT MADE US LAUGH SHE CALLED US NAMES FOR A DAY AND A HALF SHE CALLED US NAMES TILL HER MEMORY FAILED BUT FINALLY OUT OF OUR SIGHT SHE SAILED
5480-41791-0021 IT MUST HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT COUSIN ANN IN THE FIRST PLACE SAID NANCY JOINING KATHLEEN IN THE KITCHEN WELL SHE'S GONE AT LAST NOW EVERY PROSPECT PLEASES AND ONLY JULIA'S VILE SHE PARAPHRASED FROM THE OLD HYMN INTO KATHLEEN'S PRIVATE EAR
5480-41791-0022 YOU OUGHTN'T TO SAY SUCH THINGS NANCY REBUKED KATHLEEN MOTHER WOULDN'T LIKE IT I KNOW IT CONFESSED NANCY REMORSEFULLY I HAVE BEEN WICKED SINCE THE MOMENT I TRIED TO GET RID OF YOU DIRTY BOY I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME
5480-41791-0023 MY BLOOD SEEMS TO BE TOO RED AND IT COURSES WILDLY THROUGH MY VEINS AS THE BOOKS SAY I AM GOING TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF NOW THAT COUSIN ANN'S GONE AND OUR ONLY CROSS IS JULIA OH BUT IT IS RATHER DREADFUL TO THINK HOW ONE PERSON CAN SPOIL THE WORLD
5480-41791-0024 IF ONLY YOU COULD HAVE SEEN THE YELLOW HOUSE AFTER COUSIN ANA WENT IF ONLY YOU COULD HAVE HEARD THE HOTEL LANDLADY EXCLAIM AS SHE DROVE PAST WELL GOOD RIDDANCE TO BAD RUBBISH THE WEATHER GREW WARMER OUTSIDE ALMOST AT ONCE
5480-41791-0025 AND BILL HARMON'S SON PLANTED THE GARDEN THE FIREPLACES CEASED TO SMOKE AND THE KITCHEN STOVE DREW COLONEL WHEELER SUGGESTED A NEW CHAIN PUMP INSTEAD OF THE OLD WOODEN ONE AFTER WHICH THE WATER TOOK A TURN FOR THE BETTER AND BEFORE THE MONTH WAS ENDED THE YELLOW HOUSE BEGAN TO LOOK LIKE HOME
5480-41791-0026 NOTWITHSTANDING JULIA AS FOR BEULAH VILLAGE AFTER ITS SLEEP OF MONTHS UNDER DEEP SNOW DRIFTS IT HAD WAKED INTO THE ADORABLE BEAUTY OF AN EARLY NEW ENGLAND SUMMER IT HAD NO SNOW CAPPED MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
5480-41791-0027 NO AMETHYST FOOTHILLS TO ENCHAIN THE EYE NO WONDERFUL CANYONS AND SPLENDID ROCKY PASSES TO MAKE THE TOURIST MARVEL NO LENGTH OF YELLOW SEA SANDS NOR PLASH OF OCEAN SURF NO TRADE NO AMUSEMENTS NO SUMMER VISITORS
5480-41791-0028 IT WAS JUST A QUIET LITTLE SUNNY VERDANT LEAFY PIECE OF HEART'S CONTENT THAT'S WHAT BEULAH WAS AND JULIA COULDN'T SPOIL IT INDEED THE ODDS WERE THAT IT WOULD SWEETEN JULIA
5480-41791-0029 PEOPLE FANCY THAT I MAKE THINGS MY LITTLE DEAR SAYS MOTHER CAREY TO TOM THE WATER BABY BUT I SIT HERE AND MAKE THEM MAKE THEMSELVES THERE WAS ONCE A FAIRY SO THE TALE GOES WHO WAS SO CLEVER THAT SHE FOUND OUT HOW TO MAKE BUTTERFLIES
5480-41791-0030 AND SHE WAS SO PROUD THAT SHE FLEW STRAIGHT OFF TO PEACEPOOL TO BOAST TO MOTHER CAREY OF HER SKILL BUT MOTHER CAREY LAUGHED KNOW SILLY CHILD SHE SAID THAT ANY ONE CAN MAKE THINGS IF HE WILL TAKE TIME AND TROUBLE ENOUGH
5480-41791-0031 BUT IT IS NOT EVERY ONE WHO CAN MAKE THINGS MAKE THEMSELVES MAKE THINGS MAKE THEMSELVES MOTHER CAREY USED TO THINK IN THE TWILIGHT I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHAT MOTHERS ARE FOR NANCY WAS MAKING HERSELF BUSILY THESE DAYS
5480-41791-0032 AND THE OFFENDING JULIA WAS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH SELF CONTROL AND GAINS IN GENERAL VIRTUE AS POOR IMPETUOUS NANCY ACHIEVED KATHLEEN WAS GROWING STRONGER AND STEADIER AND LESS SELF CONSCIOUS GILBERT WAS DOING BETTER AT SCHOOL
5480-41791-0033 AND HIS LETTERS SHOWED MORE CONSIDERATION AND THOUGHT FOR THE FAMILY THAN THEY HAD DONE HERETOFORE EVEN THE PETER BIRD WAS A LITTLE SWEETER AND MORE SELF HELPFUL JUST NOW THOUGHT MOTHER CAREY FONDLY AS SHE ROCKED HIM TO SLEEP HE WAS WORN OUT WITH FOLLOWING NATTY HARMON AT THE PLOUGH
5480-41791-0034 AND SUCCUMBED QUICKLY TO THE MUSIC OF HER GOOD NIGHT SONG AND THE COMFORT OF HER SHELTERING ARMS MOTHER CAREY HAD ARMS TO CARRY ARMS TO ENFOLD ARMS TO COMFORT AND CARESS SHE ALSO HAD A FINE HANDSOME STRONG HAND ADMIRABLE FOR SPANKING
5480-41791-0035 AS SHE LIFTED PETER INTO HIS CRIB NANCY CAME SOFTLY IN AT THE DOOR WITH A SLIP OF PAPER IN HER HAND SHE DREW HER MOTHER OUT TO THE WINDOW OVER THE FRONT DOOR LISTEN SHE SAID
5480-41791-0036 HER MOTHER SAID ISN'T EVERYTHING SWEET TO NIGHT WITH THE SOFT AIR AND THE ELMS ALL FEATHERED OUT AND THE NEW MOON WAS IT EVER SO GREEN BEFORE NANCY WONDERED LEANING OVER THE WINDOW SILL BY HER MOTHER'S SIDE
5480-41791-0037 WAS ANY RIVER EVER SO CLEAR OR ANY MOON SO YELLOW I AM SO SORRY FOR THE CITY PEOPLE TONIGHT SOMETIMES I THINK IT CAN'T BE SO BEAUTIFUL HERE AS IT LOOKS MOTHER SOMETIMES I WONDER IF PART OF THE BEAUTY ISN'T INSIDE OF US SAID NANCY
5480-41791-0038 PART OF ALL BEAUTY IS IN THE EYES THAT LOOK AT IT HER MOTHER ANSWERED AND I'VE BEEN READING MISSUS HARMON'S NEW REFERENCE BIBLE NANCY CONTINUED AND HERE IS WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT BEULAH SHE HELD THE PAPER TO THE WANING LIGHT AND READ
5480-41791-0039 THOU SHALT NO MORE BE TERMED FORSAKEN NEITHER SHALL THY LAND ANY MORE BE TERMED DESOLATE BUT IT SHALL BE CALLED BEULAH FOR THE LORD DELIGHTETH IN THEE I THINK FATHER WOULD BE COMFORTED IF HE COULD SEE US ALL IN THE YELLOW HOUSE AT BEULAH
5480-41791-0040 NANCY WENT ON SOFTLY AS THE TWO LEANED OUT OF THE WINDOW TOGETHER HE WAS SO LOVING SO CAREFUL OF US SO AFRAID THAT ANYTHING SHOULD TROUBLE US THAT FOR MONTHS I COULDN'T THINK OF HIM EVEN IN HEAVEN AS ANYTHING BUT WORRIED
