791-127519-0000 POWDER AND ARMS THE HISPANIOLA LAY SOME WAY OUT AND WE WENT UNDER THE FIGUREHEADS AND ROUND THE STERNS OF MANY OTHER SHIPS
791-127519-0001 AND THEIR CABLES SOMETIMES GRATED UNDERNEATH OUR KEEL AND SOMETIMES SWUNG ABOVE US AT LAST HOWEVER WE GOT ALONGSIDE AND WERE MET AND SALUTED AS WE STEPPED ABOARD BY THE MATE
791-127519-0002 MISTER ARROW A BROWN OLD SAILOR WITH EARRINGS IN HIS EARS AND A SQUINT HE AND THE SQUIRE WERE VERY THICK AND FRIENDLY
791-127519-0003 BUT I SOON OBSERVED THAT THINGS WERE NOT THE SAME BETWEEN MISTER TRELAWNEY AND THE CAPTAIN THIS LAST WAS A SHARP LOOKING MAN WHO SEEMED ANGRY WITH EVERYTHING ON BOARD
791-127519-0004 AND WAS SOON TO TELL US WHY FOR WE HAD HARDLY GOT DOWN INTO THE CABIN WHEN A SAILOR FOLLOWED US CAPTAIN SMOLLETT SIR AXING TO SPEAK WITH YOU

791-127519-0010 I WAS ENGAGED SIR ON WHAT WE CALL SEALED ORDERS TO SAIL THIS SHIP FOR THAT GENTLEMAN WHERE HE SHOULD BID ME SAID THE CAPTAIN SO FAR SO GOOD

791-127519-0014 SILVER'S PARROT ASKED THE SQUIRE IT'S A WAY OF SPEAKING SAID THE CAPTAIN BLABBED I MEAN IT'S MY BELIEF NEITHER OF YOU GENTLEMEN KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT

791-127519-0018 BUT THE SLIGHT IF THERE BE ONE WAS UNINTENTIONAL AND YOU DON'T LIKE MISTER ARROW I DON'T SIR I BELIEVE HE'S A GOOD SEAMAN BUT HE'S TOO FREE WITH THE CREW TO BE A GOOD OFFICER
791-127519-0019 A MATE SHOULD KEEP HIMSELF TO HIMSELF SHOULDN'T DRINK WITH THE MEN BEFORE THE MAST DO YOU MEAN HE DRINKS CRIED THE SQUIRE NO SIR REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
791-127519-0020 ONLY THAT HE'S TOO FAMILIAR WELL NOW AND THE SHORT AND LONG OF IT CAPTAIN ASKED THE DOCTOR TELL US WHAT YOU WANT WELL GENTLEMEN

791-127519-0022 SAYING THINGS THAT I COULD NOT PROVE HEAR ME A FEW WORDS MORE THEY ARE PUTTING THE POWDER AND THE ARMS IN THE FORE HOLD NOW YOU HAVE A GOOD PLACE UNDER THE CABIN WHY NOT PUT THEM THERE
791-127519-0023 FIRST POINT THEN YOU ARE BRINGING FOUR OF YOUR OWN PEOPLE WITH YOU AND THEY TELL ME SOME OF THEM ARE TO BE BERTHED FORWARD WHY NOT GIVE THEM THE BERTHS HERE BESIDE THE CABIN
791-127519-0024 SECOND POINT ANY MORE ASKED MISTER TRELAWNEY ONE MORE SAID THE CAPTAIN THERE'S BEEN TOO MUCH BLABBING ALREADY
791-127519-0025 FAR TOO MUCH AGREED THE DOCTOR I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'VE HEARD MYSELF CONTINUED CAPTAIN SMOLLETT THAT YOU HAVE A MAP OF AN ISLAND
791-127519-0026 THAT THERE'S CROSSES ON THE MAP TO SHOW WHERE TREASURE IS AND THAT THE ISLAND LIES AND THEN HE NAMED THE LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE EXACTLY
791-127519-0027 I NEVER TOLD THAT CRIED THE SQUIRE TO A SOUL THE HANDS KNOW IT SIR RETURNED THE CAPTAIN LIVESEY THAT MUST HAVE BEEN YOU OR HAWKINS
791-127519-0028 CRIED THE SQUIRE IT DOESN'T MUCH MATTER WHO IT WAS REPLIED THE DOCTOR AND I COULD SEE THAT NEITHER HE NOR THE CAPTAIN PAID MUCH REGARD TO MISTER TRELAWNEY'S PROTESTATIONS
791-127519-0029 NEITHER DID I TO BE SURE HE WAS SO LOOSE A TALKER YET IN THIS CASE I BELIEVE HE WAS REALLY RIGHT AND THAT NOBODY HAD TOLD THE SITUATION OF THE ISLAND
791-127519-0030 WELL GENTLEMEN CONTINUED THE CAPTAIN I DON'T KNOW WHO HAS THIS MAP BUT I MAKE IT A POINT IT SHALL BE KEPT SECRET EVEN FROM ME AND MISTER ARROW
791-127519-0031 OTHERWISE I WOULD ASK YOU TO LET ME RESIGN I SEE SAID THE DOCTOR YOU WISH US TO KEEP THIS MATTER DARK
791-127519-0032 AND TO MAKE A GARRISON OF THE STERN PART OF THE SHIP MANNED WITH MY FRIEND'S OWN PEOPLE AND PROVIDED WITH ALL THE ARMS AND POWDER ON BOARD IN OTHER WORDS YOU FEAR A MUTINY
791-127519-0033 SIR SAID CAPTAIN SMOLLETT WITH NO INTENTION TO TAKE OFFENCE I DENY YOUR RIGHT TO PUT WORDS INTO MY MOUTH NO CAPTAIN SIR
791-127519-0034 WOULD BE JUSTIFIED IN GOING TO SEA AT ALL IF HE HAD GROUND ENOUGH TO SAY THAT AS FOR MISTER ARROW I BELIEVE HIM THOROUGHLY HONEST SOME OF THE MEN ARE THE SAME
791-127519-0035 ALL MAY BE FOR WHAT I KNOW BUT I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHIP'S SAFETY AND THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN JACK ABOARD OF HER I SEE THINGS GOING AS I THINK
791-127519-0036 NOT QUITE RIGHT AND I ASK YOU TO TAKE CERTAIN PRECAUTIONS OR LET ME RESIGN MY BERTH AND THAT'S ALL
791-127519-0037 CAPTAIN SMOLLETT BEGAN THE DOCTOR WITH A SMILE DID EVER YOU HEAR THE FABLE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND THE MOUSE YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I DARE SAY
791-127519-0038 BUT YOU REMIND ME OF THAT FABLE WHEN YOU CAME IN HERE I'LL STAKE MY WIG YOU MEANT MORE THAN THIS DOCTOR SAID THE CAPTAIN YOU ARE SMART
791-127519-0039 WHEN I CAME IN HERE I MEANT TO GET DISCHARGED I HAD NO THOUGHT THAT MISTER TRELAWNEY WOULD HEAR A WORD NO MORE I WOULD CRIED THE SQUIRE
791-127519-0040 HAD LIVESEY NOT BEEN HERE I SHOULD HAVE SEEN YOU TO THE DEUCE AS IT IS I HAVE HEARD YOU I WILL DO AS YOU DESIRE BUT I THINK THE WORSE OF YOU
791-127519-0041 THAT'S AS YOU PLEASE SIR SAID THE CAPTAIN YOU'LL FIND I DO MY DUTY AND WITH THAT HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
791-127519-0042 TRELAWNEY SAID THE DOCTOR CONTRARY TO ALL MY NOTIONS I BELIEVED YOU HAVE MANAGED TO GET TWO HONEST MEN ON BOARD WITH YOU THAT MAN
791-127519-0043 AND JOHN SILVER SILVER IF YOU LIKE CRIED THE SQUIRE BUT AS FOR THAT INTOLERABLE HUMBUG I DECLARE I THINK HIS CONDUCT UNMANLY UNSAILORLY
791-127519-0044 AND DOWNRIGHT UN ENGLISH WELL SAYS THE DOCTOR WE SHALL SEE
791-127519-0045 THE NEW ARRANGEMENT WAS QUITE TO MY LIKING THE WHOLE SCHOONER HAD BEEN OVERHAULED SIX BERTHS HAD BEEN MADE ASTERN OUT OF WHAT HAD BEEN THE AFTER PART OF THE MAIN HOLD
791-127519-0046 AND THIS SET OF CABINS WAS ONLY JOINED TO THE GALLEY AND FORECASTLE BY A SPARRED PASSAGE ON THE PORT SIDE IT HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY MEANT THAT THE CAPTAIN MISTER ARROW HUNTER
791-127519-0047 JOYCE THE DOCTOR AND THE SQUIRE WERE TO OCCUPY THESE SIX BERTHS NOW REDRUTH AND I WERE TO GET TWO OF THEM AND MISTER ARROW AND THE CAPTAIN WERE TO SLEEP ON DECK IN THE COMPANION
791-127519-0048 VERY LOW IT WAS STILL OF COURSE BUT THERE WAS ROOM TO SWING TWO HAMMOCKS AND EVEN THE MATE SEEMED PLEASED WITH THE ARRANGEMENT
791-127519-0049 EVEN HE PERHAPS HAD BEEN DOUBTFUL AS TO THE CREW BUT THAT IS ONLY GUESS FOR AS YOU SHALL HEAR WE HAD NOT LONG THE BENEFIT OF HIS OPINION
791-127519-0050 WE WERE ALL HARD AT WORK CHANGING THE POWDER AND THE BERTHS WHEN THE LAST MAN OR TWO AND LONG JOHN ALONG WITH THEM CAME OFF IN A SHORE BOAT
791-127519-0051 THE COOK CAME UP THE SIDE LIKE A MONKEY FOR CLEVERNESS AND AS SOON AS HE SAW WHAT WAS DOING SO HO MATES SAYS HE WHAT'S THIS
791-127519-0052 WE'RE A CHANGING OF THE POWDER JACK ANSWERS ONE WHY BY THE POWERS CRIED LONG JOHN IF WE DO WE'LL MISS THE MORNING TIDE
791-127519-0053 MY ORDERS SAID THE CAPTAIN SHORTLY YOU MAY GO BELOW MY MAN HANDS WILL WANT SUPPER AYE AYE SIR ANSWERED THE COOK
791-127519-0054 AND TOUCHING HIS FORELOCK HE DISAPPEARED AT ONCE IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS GALLEY THAT'S A GOOD MAN CAPTAIN SAID THE DOCTOR VERY LIKELY SIR REPLIED CAPTAIN SMOLLETT
791-127519-0055 EASY WITH THAT MEN EASY HE RAN ON TO THE FELLOWS WHO WERE SHIFTING THE POWDER AND THEN SUDDENLY OBSERVING ME EXAMINING THE SWIVEL WE CARRIED AMIDSHIPS A LONG BRASS NINE
791-127519-0056 HERE YOU SHIP'S BOY HE CRIED OUT O THAT OFF WITH YOU TO THE COOK AND GET SOME WORK AND THEN AS I WAS HURRYING OFF I HEARD HIM SAY QUITE LOUDLY TO THE DOCTOR
791-127519-0057 I'LL HAVE NO FAVOURITES ON MY SHIP I ASSURE YOU I WAS QUITE OF THE SQUIRE'S WAY OF THINKING AND HATED THE CAPTAIN DEEPLY
791-127519-0058 AND BOATFULS OF THE SQUIRE'S FRIENDS MISTER BLANDLY AND THE LIKE COMING OFF TO WISH HIM A GOOD VOYAGE AND A SAFE RETURN WE NEVER HAD A NIGHT AT THE ADMIRAL BENBOW WHEN I HAD HALF THE WORK
791-127519-0059 AND I WAS DOG TIRED WHEN A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN THE BOATSWAIN SOUNDED HIS PIPE AND THE CREW BEGAN TO MAN THE CAPSTAN BARS I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TWICE AS WEARY
791-127519-0060 YET I WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT THE DECK ALL WAS SO NEW AND INTERESTING TO ME THE BRIEF COMMANDS THE SHRILL NOTE OF THE WHISTLE THE MEN BUSTLING TO THEIR PLACES IN THE GLIMMER OF THE SHIP'S LANTERNS
791-127519-0061 NOW BARBECUE TIP US A STAVE CRIED ONE VOICE THE OLD ONE CRIED ANOTHER AYE AYE MATES SAID LONG JOHN
791-127519-0062 WHO WAS STANDING BY WITH HIS CRUTCH UNDER HIS ARM AND AT ONCE BROKE OUT IN THE AIR AND WORDS I KNEW SO WELL FIFTEEN MEN ON THE DEAD MAN'S CHEST
791-127519-0063 YO HO HO AND A BOTTLE OF RUM AND AT THE THIRD HO DROVE THE BARS BEFORE THEM WITH A WILL
791-127519-0064 EVEN AT THAT EXCITING MOMENT IT CARRIED ME BACK TO THE OLD ADMIRAL BENBOW IN A SECOND AND I SEEMED TO HEAR THE VOICE OF THE CAPTAIN PIPING IN THE CHORUS
791-127519-0065 BUT SOON THE ANCHOR WAS SHORT UP SOON IT WAS HANGING DRIPPING AT THE BOWS SOON THE SAILS BEGAN TO DRAW AND THE LAND AND SHIPPING TO FLIT BY ON EITHER SIDE
791-127519-0066 AND BEFORE I COULD LIE DOWN TO SNATCH AN HOUR OF SLUMBER THE HISPANIOLA HAD BEGUN HER VOYAGE TO THE ISLE OF TREASURE I AM NOT GOING TO RELATE
791-127519-0067 THAT VOYAGE IN DETAIL IT WAS FAIRLY PROSPEROUS THE SHIP PROVED TO BE A GOOD SHIP THE CREW WERE CAPABLE SEAMEN AND THE CAPTAIN THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD HIS BUSINESS
791-127519-0068 BUT BEFORE WE CAME THE LENGTH OF TREASURE ISLAND TWO OR THREE THINGS HAD HAPPENED WHICH REQUIRE TO BE KNOWN MISTER ARROW FIRST OF ALL
791-127519-0069 TURNED OUT EVEN WORSE THAN THE CAPTAIN HAD FEARED HE HAD NO COMMAND AMONG THE MEN AND PEOPLE DID WHAT THEY PLEASED WITH HIM BUT THAT WAS BY NO MEANS THE WORST OF IT
791-127519-0070 FOR AFTER A DAY OR TWO AT SEA HE BEGAN TO APPEAR ON DECK WITH HAZY EYE RED CHEEKS STUTTERING TONGUE AND OTHER MARKS OF DRUNKENNESS
791-127519-0071 TIME AFTER TIME HE WAS ORDERED BELOW IN DISGRACE SOMETIMES HE FELL AND CUT HIMSELF SOMETIMES HE LAY ALL DAY LONG IN HIS LITTLE BUNK AT ONE SIDE OF THE COMPANION
791-127519-0072 SOMETIMES FOR A DAY OR TWO HE WOULD BE ALMOST SOBER AND ATTEND TO HIS WORK AT LEAST PASSABLY IN THE MEANTIME WE COULD NEVER MAKE OUT WHERE HE GOT THE DRINK
791-127519-0073 THAT WAS THE SHIP'S MYSTERY WATCH HIM AS WE PLEASED WE COULD DO NOTHING TO SOLVE IT AND WHEN WE ASKED HIM TO HIS FACE HE WOULD ONLY LAUGH IF HE WERE DRUNK
791-127519-0074 AND IF HE WERE SOBER DENY SOLEMNLY THAT HE EVER TASTED ANYTHING BUT WATER HE WAS NOT ONLY USELESS AS AN OFFICER AND A BAD INFLUENCE AMONGST THE MEN
791-127519-0075 BUT IT WAS PLAIN THAT AT THIS RATE HE MUST SOON KILL HIMSELF OUTRIGHT SO NOBODY WAS MUCH SURPRISED NOR VERY SORRY WHEN ONE DARK NIGHT
791-127519-0076 WITH A HEAD SEA HE DISAPPEARED ENTIRELY AND WAS SEEN NO MORE OVERBOARD SAID THE CAPTAIN WELL GENTLEMEN
791-127519-0077 THAT SAVES THE TROUBLE OF PUTTING HIM IN IRONS BUT THERE WE WERE WITHOUT A MATE AND IT WAS NECESSARY OF COURSE TO ADVANCE ONE OF THE MEN THE BOATSWAIN
791-127519-0078 JOB ANDERSON WAS THE LIKELIEST MAN ABOARD AND THOUGH HE KEPT HIS OLD TITLE HE SERVED IN A WAY AS MATE MISTER TRELAWNEY HAD FOLLOWED THE SEA AND HIS KNOWLEDGE MADE HIM VERY USEFUL
791-127519-0079 FOR HE OFTEN TOOK A WATCH HIMSELF IN EASY WEATHER AND THE COXSWAIN ISRAEL HANDS WAS A CAREFUL WILY OLD EXPERIENCED SEAMAN
791-127519-0080 WHO COULD BE TRUSTED AT A PINCH WITH ALMOST ANYTHING HE WAS A GREAT CONFIDANT OF LONG JOHN SILVER AND SO THE MENTION OF HIS NAME
791-127519-0081 OF OUR SHIP'S COOK BARBECUE AS THE MEN CALLED HIM ABOARD SHIP HE CARRIED HIS CRUTCH BY A LANYARD ROUND HIS NECK TO HAVE BOTH HANDS AS FREE AS POSSIBLE
791-127519-0082 IT WAS SOMETHING TO SEE HIM WEDGE THE FOOT OF THE CRUTCH AGAINST A BULKHEAD AND PROPPED AGAINST IT YIELDING TO EVERY MOVEMENT OF THE SHIP
791-127519-0083 STILL MORE STRANGE WAS IT TO SEE HIM IN THE HEAVIEST OF WEATHER CROSS THE DECK HE HAD A LINE OR TWO RIGGED UP TO HELP HIM ACROSS THE WIDEST SPACES LONG JOHN'S EARRINGS THEY WERE CALLED
791-127519-0084 AND HE WOULD HAND HIMSELF FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER NOW USING THE CRUTCH NOW TRAILING IT ALONGSIDE BY THE LANYARD AS QUICKLY AS ANOTHER MAN COULD WALK
791-127519-0085 YET SOME OF THE MEN WHO HAD SAILED WITH HIM BEFORE EXPRESSED THEIR PITY TO SEE HIM SO REDUCED HE'S NO COMMON MAN BARBECUE SAID THE COXSWAIN TO ME
791-127519-0086 HE HAD GOOD SCHOOLING IN HIS YOUNG DAYS AND CAN SPEAK LIKE A BOOK WHEN SO MINDED AND BRAVE A LION'S NOTHING ALONGSIDE OF LONG JOHN I SEEN HIM GRAPPLE FOUR AND KNOCK THEIR HEADS TOGETHER
791-127519-0087 HIM UNARMED ALL THE CREW RESPECTED AND EVEN OBEYED HIM HE HAD A WAY OF TALKING TO EACH AND DOING EVERYBODY SOME PARTICULAR SERVICE
791-127519-0088 TO ME HE WAS UNWEARIEDLY KIND AND ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE ME IN THE GALLEY WHICH HE KEPT AS CLEAN AS A NEW PIN THE DISHES HANGING UP BURNISHED AND HIS PARROT IN A CAGE IN ONE CORNER
791-127519-0089 COME AWAY HAWKINS HE WOULD SAY COME AND HAVE A YARN WITH JOHN NOBODY MORE WELCOME THAN YOURSELF MY SON SIT YOU DOWN AND HEAR THE NEWS
791-127519-0090 PIECES OF EIGHT PIECES OF EIGHT TILL YOU WONDERED THAT IT WAS NOT OUT OF BREATH OR TILL JOHN THREW HIS HANDKERCHIEF OVER THE CAGE NOW THAT BIRD HE WOULD SAY
791-127519-0091 IS MAYBE TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD HAWKINS THEY LIVE FOREVER MOSTLY AND IF ANYBODY'S SEEN MORE WICKEDNESS IT MUST BE THE DEVIL HIMSELF
791-127519-0092 SHE'S SAILED WITH ENGLAND THE GREAT CAP'N ENGLAND THE PIRATE SHE'S BEEN AT MADAGASCAR
791-127519-0093 AND SURINAM AND PROVIDENCE AND PORTOBELLO SHE WAS AT THE FISHING UP OF THE WRECKED PLATE SHIPS IT'S THERE SHE LEARNED PIECES OF EIGHT AND LITTLE WONDER
791-127519-0094 THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND OF EM HAWKINS SHE WAS AT THE BOARDING OF THE VICEROY OF THE INDIES OUT OF GOA SHE WAS
791-127519-0095 BUT YOU SMELT POWDER
791-127519-0096 STAND BY TO GO ABOUT THE PARROT WOULD SCREAM AH SHE'S A HANDSOME CRAFT SHE IS THE COOK WOULD SAY AND GIVE HER SUGAR FROM HIS POCKET
791-127519-0097 AND THEN THE BIRD WOULD PECK AT THE BARS AND SWEAR STRAIGHT ON PASSING BELIEF FOR WICKEDNESS THERE JOHN WOULD ADD YOU CAN'T TOUCH PITCH AND NOT BE MUCKED LAD
791-127519-0098 HERE'S THIS POOR OLD INNOCENT BIRD O MINE SWEARING BLUE FIRE AND NONE THE WISER YOU MAY LAY TO THAT SHE WOULD SWEAR THE SAME IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING BEFORE CHAPLAIN
791-127519-0099 AND JOHN WOULD TOUCH HIS FORELOCK WITH A SOLEMN WAY HE HAD THAT MADE ME THINK HE WAS THE BEST OF MEN
791-127519-0100 IN THE MEANTIME THE SQUIRE AND CAPTAIN SMOLLETT WERE STILL ON PRETTY DISTANT TERMS WITH ONE ANOTHER THE SQUIRE MADE NO BONES ABOUT THE MATTER HE DESPISED THE CAPTAIN
791-127519-0101 THE CAPTAIN ON HIS PART NEVER SPOKE BUT WHEN HE WAS SPOKEN TO AND THEN SHARP AND SHORT AND DRY AND NOT A WORD WASTED HE OWNED WHEN DRIVEN INTO A CORNER
791-127519-0102 THAT HE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN WRONG ABOUT THE CREW THAT SOME OF THEM WERE AS BRISK AS HE WANTED TO SEE AND ALL HAD BEHAVED FAIRLY WELL AS FOR THE SHIP
791-127519-0103 HE HAD TAKEN A DOWNRIGHT FANCY TO HER SHE'LL LIE A POINT NEARER THE WIND THAN A MAN HAS A RIGHT TO EXPECT OF HIS OWN MARRIED WIFE SIR BUT HE WOULD ADD ALL I SAY IS
791-127519-0104 WE'RE NOT HOME AGAIN AND I DON'T LIKE THE CRUISE THE SQUIRE AT THIS WOULD TURN AWAY AND MARCH UP AND DOWN THE DECK CHIN IN AIR
791-127519-0105 A TRIFLE MORE OF THAT MAN HE WOULD SAY AND I SHALL EXPLODE WE HAD SOME HEAVY WEATHER
791-127519-0106 WHICH ONLY PROVED THE QUALITIES OF THE HISPANIOLA EVERY MAN ON BOARD SEEMED WELL CONTENT AND THEY MUST HAVE BEEN HARD TO PLEASE IF THEY HAD BEEN OTHERWISE
791-127519-0107 DOUBLE GROG WAS GOING ON THE LEAST EXCUSE THERE WAS DUFF ON ODD DAYS AS FOR INSTANCE IF THE SQUIRE HEARD IT WAS ANY MAN'S BIRTHDAY AND ALWAYS A BARREL OF APPLES STANDING BROACHED IN THE WAIST
791-127519-0108 FOR ANYONE TO HELP HIMSELF THAT HAD A FANCY NEVER KNEW GOOD COME OF IT YET THE CAPTAIN SAID TO DOCTOR LIVESEY SPOIL FORECASTLE HANDS MAKE DEVILS THAT'S MY BELIEF
791-127519-0109 BUT GOOD DID COME OF THE APPLE BARREL AS YOU SHALL HEAR FOR IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THAT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD NO NOTE OF WARNING AND MIGHT ALL HAVE PERISHED
791-127519-0110 BY THE HAND OF TREACHERY THIS WAS HOW IT CAME ABOUT WE HAD RUN UP THE TRADES TO GET THE WIND OF THE ISLAND WE WERE AFTER
791-127519-0111 I AM NOT ALLOWED TO BE MORE PLAIN AND NOW WE WERE RUNNING DOWN FOR IT WITH A BRIGHT LOOKOUT DAY AND NIGHT IT WAS ABOUT THE LAST DAY OF OUR OUTWARD VOYAGE BY THE LARGEST COMPUTATION
791-127519-0112 SOME TIME THAT NIGHT OR AT LATEST BEFORE NOON OF THE MORROW WE SHOULD SIGHT THE TREASURE ISLAND
791-127519-0113 THE HISPANIOLA ROLLED STEADILY DIPPING HER BOWSPRIT NOW AND THEN WITH A WHIFF OF SPRAY ALL WAS DRAWING ALOW AND ALOFT EVERYONE WAS IN THE BRAVEST SPIRITS
791-127519-0114 BECAUSE WE WERE NOW SO NEAR AN END OF THE FIRST PART OF OUR ADVENTURE
791-127519-0115 WHEN ALL MY WORK WAS OVER AND I WAS ON MY WAY TO MY BERTH IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I SHOULD LIKE AN APPLE I RAN ON DECK THE WATCH WAS ALL FORWARD LOOKING OUT FOR THE ISLAND
791-127519-0116 THE MAN AT THE HELM WAS WATCHING THE LUFF OF THE SAIL AND WHISTLING AWAY GENTLY TO HIMSELF AND THAT WAS THE ONLY SOUND EXCEPTING THE SWISH OF THE SEA AGAINST THE BOWS AND AROUND THE SIDES OF THE SHIP
791-127519-0117 IN I GOT BODILY INTO THE APPLE BARREL AND FOUND THERE WAS SCARCE AN APPLE LEFT BUT SITTING DOWN THERE IN THE DARK
791-127519-0118 WHAT WITH THE SOUND OF THE WATERS AND THE ROCKING MOVEMENT OF THE SHIP I HAD EITHER FALLEN ASLEEP OR WAS ON THE POINT OF DOING SO WHEN A HEAVY MAN SAT DOWN WITH RATHER A CLASH CLOSE BY
791-127519-0119 THE BARREL SHOOK AS HE LEANED HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST IT AND I WAS JUST ABOUT TO JUMP UP WHEN THE MAN BEGAN TO SPEAK IT WAS SILVER'S VOICE
791-127519-0120 AND BEFORE I HAD HEARD A DOZEN WORDS I WOULD NOT HAVE SHOWN MYSELF FOR ALL THE WORLD BUT LAY THERE
791-127519-0121 TREMBLING AND LISTENING IN THE EXTREME OF FEAR AND CURIOSITY FOR FROM THESE DOZEN WORDS I UNDERSTOOD THAT THE LIVES OF ALL THE HONEST MEN ABOARD
