8543-280375-0000 IN THE DAYS OF LONG AGO THERE REIGNED OVER ITHACA A RUGGED LITTLE ISLAND IN THE SEA TO THE WEST OF GREECE A KING WHOSE NAME WAS ODYSSEUS ODYSSEUS FEARED NO MAN STRONGER AND BRAVER THAN OTHER MEN WAS HE
8543-280375-0001 WISER AND MORE FULL OF CLEVER DEVICES FAR AND WIDE HE WAS KNOWN AS ODYSSEUS OF THE MANY COUNSELS
8543-280375-0002 WHILE THEIR ONLY CHILD A BOY NAMED TELEMACHUS WAS STILL A BABY THERE WAS A VERY GREAT WAR IN TROYLAND A COUNTRY FAR ACROSS THE SEA THE BROTHER OF THE OVERLORD OF ALL GREECE BESEIGED TROY
8543-280375-0003 AND THE KINGS AND PRINCES OF HIS LAND CAME TO HELP HIM MANY CAME FROM AFAR BUT NONE FROM A MORE DISTANT KINGDOM THAN ODYSSEUS WIFE AND CHILD AND OLD FATHER HE LEFT BEHIND HIM
8543-280375-0004 AND SAILED AWAY WITH HIS BLACK PROWED SHIPS TO FIGHT IN TROYLAND FOR TEN YEARS THE SIEGE OF TROY WENT ON
8543-280375-0005 AND OF THE HEROES WHO FOUGHT THERE NONE WAS BRAVER THAN ODYSSEUS CLAD AS A BEGGAR HE WENT INTO THE CITY AND FOUND OUT MUCH TO HELP THE GREEK ARMIES
8543-280375-0006 WITH HIS LONG SWORD HE FOUGHT HIS WAY OUT AGAIN AND LEFT MANY OF THE MEN OF TROY LYING DEAD BEHIND HIM AND MANY OTHER BRAVE FEATS DID ODYSSEUS DO AFTER LONG YEARS OF FIGHTING TROY AT LAST WAS TAKEN
8543-280375-0007 WITH MUCH RICH PLUNDER THE BESIEGERS SAILED HOMEWARDS AND ODYSSEUS SET SAIL FOR HIS ROCKY ISLAND WITH ITS GREAT MOUNTAIN AND ITS FORESTS OF TREMBLING LEAVES OF GLADNESS AND OF LONGING HIS HEART WAS FULL
8543-280375-0008 WITH A GREAT LOVE HE LOVED HIS FAIR WIFE AND LITTLE SON AND OLD FATHER AND HIS LITTLE KINGDOM BY THE SEA WAS VERY DEAR TO HIM I CAN SEE NOUGHT BESIDE SWEETER THAN A MAN'S OWN COUNTRY HE SAID
8543-280375-0009 VERY SOON HE HOPED TO SEE HIS DEAR LAND AGAIN BUT MANY A LONG AND WEARY DAY WAS TO PASS ERE ODYSSEUS CAME HOME ODYSSEUS WAS A WARRIOR AND ALWAYS HE WOULD CHOOSE TO FIGHT RATHER THAN TO BE AT PEACE
8543-280375-0010 AS HE SAILED ON HIS HOMEWARD WAY WINDS DROVE HIS SHIPS NEAR THE SHORE HE AND HIS COMPANY LANDED SACKED THE NEAREST CITY AND SLEW THE PEOPLE MUCH RICH PLUNDER THEY TOOK BUT ERE THEY COULD RETURN TO THEIR SHIPS
8543-280375-0011 A HOST OF PEOPLE CAME FROM INLAND IN THE EARLY MORNING THICK AS LEAVES AND FLOWERS IN THE SPRING THEY CAME AND FELL UPON ODYSSEUS AND HIS MEN ALL DAY THEY FOUGHT BUT AS THE SUN WENT DOWN THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND WON THE FIGHT
8543-280375-0012 BACK TO THEIR SHIPS WENT ODYSSEUS AND HIS MEN OUT OF EACH SHIP WERE SIX MEN SLAIN WHILE THEY WERE YET SAD AT HEART AND WEARY FROM THE FIGHT A TERRIBLE TEMPEST AROSE LAND AND SEA WERE BLOTTED OUT THE SHIPS WERE DRIVEN HEADLONG
8543-280375-0013 AND THEIR SAILS WERE TORN TO SHREDS BY THE MIGHT OF THE STORM
8543-280375-0014 AT DAWN ON THE THIRD DAY THE STORM PASSED AWAY AND ODYSSEUS AND HIS MEN SET UP THEIR MASTS AND HOISTED THEIR WHITE SAILS AND DROVE HOMEWARD BEFORE THE WIND SO HE WOULD HAVE COME SAFELY TO HIS OWN COUNTRY
8543-280375-0015 BUT A STRONG CURRENT AND A FIERCE NORTH WIND SWEPT THE SHIPS FROM THEIR COURSE FOR NINE DAYS WERE THEY DRIVEN FAR FROM THEIR HOMELAND ACROSS THE DEEP SEA ON THE TENTH DAY THEY REACHED THE LAND OF THE LOTUS EATERS
8543-280375-0016 THE DWELLERS IN THAT LAND FED ON THE HONEY SWEET FRUIT OF THE LOTUS FLOWER THOSE WHO ATE THE LOTUS CEASED TO REMEMBER THAT THERE WAS A PAST OR A FUTURE
8543-280375-0017 ALL DAY LONG THEY WOULD SIT AND DREAM AND DREAM IDLE HAPPY DREAMS THAT NEVER ENDED HERE ODYSSEUS AND HIS MEN LANDED AND DREW WATER THREE OF HIS WARRIORS ODYSSEUS SENT INTO THE COUNTRY TO SEE WHAT
8543-280375-0018 MANNER OF MEN DWELT THERE TO THEM THE LOTUS EATERS GAVE THEIR HONEY SWEET FOOD AND NO SOONER HAD EACH MAN EATEN THAN HE HAD NO WISH EVER TO RETURN TO THE SHIPS HE LONGED FOR EVER TO STAY IN THAT PLEASANT LAND EATING THE LOTUS FRUIT
8543-280375-0019 AND DREAMING THE HAPPY HOURS AWAY BACK TO THE SHIPS ODYSSEUS DRAGGED THE UNWILLING MEN WEEPING THAT THEY MUST LEAVE SO MUCH JOY BEHIND
8543-280375-0020 BENEATH THE BENCHES OF HIS SHIP HE TIGHTLY BOUND THEM AND SWIFTLY HE MADE HIS SHIPS SAIL FROM THE SHORE LEST YET OTHERS OF HIS COMPANY MIGHT EAT OF THE LOTUS AND FORGET THEIR HOMES AND THEIR KINDRED
8543-280375-0021 SOON THEY HAD ALL EMBARKED AND WITH HEAVY HEARTS THE MEN OF ITHACA SMOTE THE GRAY SEA WATER WITH THEIR LONG OARS AND SPED AWAY FROM THE LAND OF FORGETFULNESS AND OF SWEET DAY DREAMS
8543-280375-0022 ON AND ON ACROSS THE WAVES SAILED THE DARK PROWED SHIPS OF ODYSSEUS UNTIL AGAIN THEY CAME TO LAND IT WAS THE LAND OF THE CYCLOPES A SAVAGE AND LAWLESS PEOPLE WHO NEVER PLANTED NOR PLOWED NOR SOWED
8543-280375-0023 AND WHOSE FIELDS YET GAVE THEM RICH HARVESTS OF WHEAT AND OF BARLEY AND VINES WITH HEAVY CLUSTERS OF GRAPES IN DEEP CAVES HIGH UP ON THE HILLS THESE PEOPLE DWELT AND EACH MAN RULED HIS OWN WIFE AND CHILDREN
8543-280375-0024 BUT HIMSELF KNEW NO RULER OUTSIDE THE HARBOR OF THE LAND OF THE CYCLOPES LAY A THICKLY WOODED ISLAND NO HUNTERS WENT THERE FOR THE CYCLOPES OWNED NEITHER SHIPS NOR BOATS
8543-280375-0025 SO THAT MANY GOATS ROAMED UNHARMED THROUGH THE WOODS AND CROPPED THE FRESH GREEN GRASS IT WAS A GREEN AND PLEASANT LAND RICH MEADOWS STRETCHED DOWN TO THE SEA THE VINES GREW STRONG AND FRUITFUL
8543-280375-0026 AND THERE WAS A FAIR HARBOR WHERE SHIPS MIGHT BE RUN RIGHT ON TO THE BEACH AT THE HEAD OF THE HARBOR WAS A WELL OF CLEAR WATER FLOWING OUT OF A CAVE AND WITH POPLARS GROWING AROUND IT THITHER ODYSSEUS DIRECTED HIS SHIPS
8543-280375-0027 IT WAS DARK NIGHT WITH NO MOON TO GUIDE AND MIST LAY DEEP ON EITHER SIDE YET THEY PASSED THE BREAKERS AND ROLLING SURF WITHOUT KNOWING IT AND ANCHORED SAFELY ON THE BEACH ALL NIGHT THEY SLEPT AND WHEN ROSY DAWN CAME
8543-280375-0028 ALL THE LIVELONG DAY ODYSSEUS AND HIS MEN SAT AND FEASTED AS THEY ATE AND DRANK THEY LOOKED ACROSS THE WATER AT THE LAND OF THE CYCLOPES WHERE THE SMOKE OF WOOD FIRES CURLED UP TO THE SKY
8543-280375-0029 AND FROM WHENCE THEY COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF MEN'S VOICES AND THE BLEATING OF SHEEP AND GOATS WHEN DARKNESS FELL THEY LAY DOWN TO SLEEP ON THE SEA BEACH AND WHEN MORNING DAWNED ODYSSEUS CALLED HIS MEN TOGETHER AND SAID TO THEM
8543-280375-0030 STAY HERE ALL THE REST OF YOU MY DEAR COMPANIONS BUT I WILL GO WITH MY OWN SHIP AND MY SHIP'S COMPANY AND SEE WHAT KIND OF MEN ARE THOSE WHO DWELL IN THIS LAND ACROSS THE HARBOR
8543-280375-0031 SO SAYING HE CLIMBED INTO HIS SHIP AND HIS MEN ROWED HIM ACROSS TO THE LAND OF THE CYCLOPES WHEN THEY WERE NEAR THE SHORE THEY SAW A GREAT CAVE BY THE SEA
8543-280375-0032 SHEEP AND GOATS ROUND ABOUT IT A HIGH OUTER WALL WAS FIRMLY BUILT WITH STONES AND WITH TALL AND LEAFY PINES AND OAK TREES IN THIS CAVE ALL ALONE WITH HIS FLOCKS AND HERDS
8543-280375-0033 DWELT A HUGE AND HIDEOUS ONE EYED GIANT POLYPHEMUS WAS HIS NAME AND HIS FATHER WAS POSEIDON GOD OF THE SEA
8543-280375-0034 WITH HIM HE CARRIED A GOAT SKIN FULL OF PRECIOUS WINE DARK RED AND SWEET AND STRONG AND A LARGE SACK OF CORN SOON THEY CAME TO THE CAVE BUT POLYPHEMUS WAS NOT THERE HE HAD TAKEN OFF HIS FLOCKS TO GRAZE IN THE GREEN MEADOWS
8543-280375-0035 LEAVING BEHIND HIM IN THE CAVE FOLDS FULL OF LAMBS AND KIDS THE WALLS OF THE CAVE WERE LINED WITH CHEESES AND THERE WERE GREAT PANS FULL OF WHEY AND GIANT BOWLS FULL OF MILK
8543-280375-0036 AND CARRY THEM TO THE SHIPS THEN LET US RETURN AND DRIVE ALL THE KIDS AND LAMBS FROM THEIR FOLDS DOWN TO THE SHORE AND SAIL WITH THEM IN OUR SWIFT SHIPS HOMEWARD OVER THE SEA BUT ODYSSEUS WOULD NOT LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAID
8543-280375-0037 HE WAS TOO GREAT HEARTED TO STEAL INTO THE CAVE LIKE A THIEF AND TAKE AWAY THE GIANT'S GOODS WITHOUT FIRST SEEING WHETHER POLYPHEMUS MIGHT NOT TREAT HIM AS A FRIEND RECEIVING FROM HIM THE CORN AND WINE HE HAD BROUGHT AND GIVING HIM GIFTS IN RETURN
8543-280375-0038 SO THEY KINDLED A FIRE AND DINED ON SOME OF THE CHEESES AND SAT WAITING FOR THE GIANT TO RETURN TOWARDS EVENING HE CAME DRIVING HIS FLOCKS BEFORE HIM AND CARRYING ON HIS BACK A HUGE LOAD OF FIREWOOD
8543-280375-0039 FLED IN FEAR AND HID THEMSELVES IN THE DARKEST CORNERS OF THE CAVE WHEN HE HAD DRIVEN HIS SHEEP INSIDE POLYPHEMUS LIFTED FROM THE GROUND A ROCK SO HUGE THAT TWO AND TWENTY FOUR WHEELED WAGONS COULD NOT HAVE BORNE IT
8543-280375-0040 AND WITH IT BLOCKED THE DOORWAY THEN SITTING DOWN HE MILKED THE EWES AND BLEATING GOATS
8543-280375-0041 HALF OF THE MILK HE CURDLED AND PLACED IN WICKER BASKETS TO MAKE INTO CHEESES
8543-280375-0042 BUT ODYSSEUS MADE ANSWER
