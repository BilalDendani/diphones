3268-59224-0000 WHEREABOUTS YOU MAY ASK DID THIS COME TO PASS WELL IT IS ONE OF THE PECULIARITIES OF THIS WAR THAT IN SPITE OF MY FAMILIARITY WITH MAPS AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE EXCELLENCE IN DETAIL OF THE PLANS WHICH I CARRY ABOUT WITH ME
3268-59224-0001 I NEVER KNOW WHERE I AM AT ANY RATE THIS CERTAINLY HAPPENED SOMEWHERE I HAVE MOREOVER A SAD CONVICTION THAT IT HAPPENED IN FRANCE I SHOULD SO MUCH HAVE PREFERRED IT TO HAVE HAPPENED IN GERMANY
3268-59224-0002 UNDER FIRE OF THEIR GUNS I HAD TRAVELLED BY MOTOR CAR SINCE MORNING AND HAD PASSED THROUGH MORE TOWNS LARGE AND SMALL THAN I CAN COUNT I REMEMBER ONE SCENE IN A VILLAGE WHERE I HALTED
3268-59224-0003 A VILLAGE WHICH HAD CERTAINLY NEVER BEFORE SEEN MOTOR OMNIBUSES OR THRONGS OF SOLDIERS AND HORSES SOME FIFTY GERMAN PRISONERS WERE BROUGHT IN THEY WERE UNSHAVEN UNSHORN AND HIGHLY UNPREPOSSESSING
3268-59224-0004 I WILL NOT FLATTER THEM BY SAYING THAT THEY LOOKED LIKE SAVAGES FOR TRUE SAVAGES IN THE BUSH ARE SELDOM LACKING EITHER IN DISTINCTION OR GRACE OF BEARING SUCH AIR AS THESE GERMANS HAD WAS A BLACKGUARD AIR OF DOLTISH UGLINESS
3268-59224-0005 DULL GROSS INCURABLE A PRETTY GIRL OF SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL CHARACTER WITH FEATHERS IN HER HAT WHO HAD TAKEN UP A POSITION THERE TO WATCH THEM GO PAST STARED AT THEM
3268-59224-0006 WITH ILL CONCEALED RESENTMENT OH INDEED IS IT WITH FREAKS LIKE THOSE THAT THEIR DIRTY KAISER INVITES US TO BREED FOR BEAUTY GOD'S TRUTH
3268-59224-0007 IT WAS COLD WITH THAT BITTER PENETRATING CHILL WHICH WE HARDLY KNOW IN MY HOME IN SOUTH WEST FRANCE AND WHICH SEEMED CHARACTERISTIC OF NORTHERN LANDS FROM TIME TO TIME A VILLAGE THROUGH WHICH THE BARBARIANS HAD PASSED DISPLAYED TO US ITS RUINS
3268-59224-0008 SOLDIERS THEIR NAMES NOW FOR EVER FORGOTTEN HAD FALLEN THERE EXHAUSTED AND HAD BREATHED THEIR LAST WITH NONE TO HELP THEM WE SCARCELY NOTICED THEM FOR WE RACED ALONG WITH EVER INCREASING SPEED
3268-59224-0009 BECAUSE THE NIGHT OF LATE OCTOBER WAS ALREADY CLOSING RAPIDLY IN UPON US AS THE DAY ADVANCED A MIST ALMOST WINTRY IN CHARACTER THICKENED AROUND US LIKE A SHROUD SILENCE PERVADED WITH STILL DEEPER MELANCHOLY ALL THAT COUNTRYSIDE
3268-59224-0010 OF WHICH NOTHING REMAINED SAVE FRAGMENTS OF CALCINED WALLS THERE WERE TWO GRAVES LYING SIDE BY SIDE NEAR THESE I HALTED TO LOOK AT A LITTLE GIRL OF TWELVE YEARS QUITE ALONE THERE ARRANGING BUNCHES OF FLOWERS
3268-59224-0011 SPRINKLED WITH WATER SOME POOR CHRYSANTHEMUMS FROM HER RUINED PLOT OF GARDEN SOME WILD FLOWERS TOO THE LAST SCABIOUS OF THE SEASON GATHERED IN THAT PLACE OF MOURNING
3268-59224-0012 IS IT A MOTHER IN SKILFULLY FASHIONED DRAPERIES OF CRAPE IS IT A MOTHER IN THE HOMELY WEEDS OF A PEASANT WOMAN WHICHEVER IT BE THOSE WHO LOVED THEM WILL LIVE AND DIE WITHOUT EVER KNOWING THAT THEY LIE MOULDERING THERE
3268-59224-0013 BY THE SIDE OF A LONELY ROAD ON THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF FRANCE WITHOUT EVER KNOWING THAT THIS KIND LITTLE GIRL WHOSE OWN HOME LAY DESOLATE BROUGHT THEM AN OFFERING OF FLOWERS ONE AUTUMN EVENING WHILE
3268-59224-0014 WITH THE ADVENT OF NIGHT A BITTER COLD WAS DESCENDING UPON THE FOREST WHICH WRAPPED THEM ROUND FARTHER ON I CAME TO A VILLAGE THE HEADQUARTERS OF A GENERAL OFFICER IN COMMAND OF AN ARMY CORPS
3268-59224-0015 OF WHAT WERE ONCE MOTOR OMNIBUSES IN PARIS BUT HAVE BEEN CONVERTED SINCE THE WAR INTO SLAUGHTER HOUSES ON WHEELS TOWNSPEOPLE MEN AND WOMEN SAT THERE ONCE WHERE NOW SIDES OF BEEF ALL RED AND RAW
3268-59224-0016 SWING SUSPENDED FROM HOOKS IF WE DID NOT KNOW THAT IN THOSE FIELDS YONDER THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MEN TO BE FED WE MIGHT WELL ASK WHY SUCH THINGS WERE BEING CARTED IN THE MIDST OF THIS DESERTED COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH WE ARE HASTENING AT TOP SPEED
3268-59224-0017 THE DAY IS WANING RAPIDLY AND A CONTINUOUS RUMBLING OF A STORM BEGINS TO MAKE ITSELF HEARD UNCHAINED SEEMINGLY ON A LEVEL WITH THE EARTH FOR WEEKS NOW THIS SAME STORM HAS THUNDERED AWAY WITHOUT PAUSE
3268-59224-0018 ALONG A SINUOUS LINE STRETCHING ACROSS FRANCE FROM EAST TO WEST A LINE ON WHICH DAILY ALAS NEW HEAPS OF DEAD ARE PILED UP HERE WE ARE SAID MY GUIDE
3268-59224-0019 IF I WERE NOT ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE NEW CHARACTERISTICS WHEREWITH THE GERMANS HAVE ENDUED A BATTLE FRONT I SHOULD BELIEVE IN SPITE OF THE INCESSANT CANNONADE THAT HE HAD MADE A MISTAKE FOR AT FIRST SIGHT
3268-59224-0020 THERE IS NO SIGN EITHER OF ARMY OR OF SOLDIERS WE ARE IN A PLACE OF SINISTER ASPECT A VAST PLAIN THE GREYISH GROUND IS STRIPPED OF ITS TURF AND TORN UP TREES HERE AND THERE ARE SHATTERED MORE OR LESS COMPLETELY
3268-59224-0021 AS IF BY SOME CATACLYSM OF THUNDERBOLTS OR HAILSTONES THERE IS NO TRACE OF HUMAN EXISTENCE NOT EVEN THE RUINS OF A VILLAGE NOTHING CHARACTERISTIC OF ANY PERIOD EITHER OF HISTORICAL OR EVEN
3268-59224-0022 THROUGH WONDERFUL BINOCULARS BY WHOSE AID THEY ARE AS KEEN OF SIGHT AS GREAT BIRDS OF PREY TO REACH THE FIRING LINE THEN IT IS INCUMBENT ON US TO PROCEED ON FOOT HOW STRANGE THE GROUND LOOKS
3268-59224-0023 BUT IN SPITE OF ITS DESERTED APPEARANCE THIS REGION IS NEVERTHELESS THICKLY POPULATED ONLY THE INHABITANTS ARE NO DOUBT TROGLODYTES FOR THEIR DWELLINGS SCATTERED ABOUT AND INVISIBLE AT FIRST SIGHT
3268-59224-0024 ARE A KIND OF CAVE OR MOLEHILL HALF COVERED WITH BRANCHES AND LEAVES I HAD SEEN THE SAME KIND OF ARCHITECTURE ONCE UPON A TIME ON EASTER ISLAND AND THE SIGHT OF THESE DWELLINGS OF MEN IN THIS SCENERY OF PRIMEVAL FOREST
3268-59224-0025 COMPLETES OUR EARLIER IMPRESSION OF HAVING LEAPT BACKWARDS INTO THE ABYSS OF TIME OF A TRUTH TO FORCE UPON US SUCH A REVERSION WAS A RIGHT PRUSSIAN ARTIFICE WAR
3268-59224-0026 WITH AN AIR OF HEALTH AND GOOD HUMOUR AND OF AMUSEMENT AT HAVING TO LIVE THERE LIKE RABBITS A SERGEANT COMES UP TO US HE IS AS EARTHY AS A MOLE THAT HAS NOT HAD TIME TO CLEAN ITSELF BUT HE HAS A MERRY LOOK OF YOUTH AND GAIETY
3268-59224-0027 ANOTHER MILE OR TWO HAVE STILL TO BE COVERED ON FOOT BEFORE WE REACH THE FIRING LINE AN ICY WIND BLOWS FROM THE FORESTS OPPOSITE THAT ARE YET MORE DEEPLY DROWNED IN BLACK MISTS FORESTS IN THE ENEMY'S HANDS
3268-59224-0028 WHERE THE COUNTERFEIT THUNDERSTORM IS GRUMBLING THIS PLAIN WITH ITS MISERABLE MOLEHILLS IS A DISMAL PLACE IN THE TWILIGHT AND I MARVEL THAT THEY CAN BE SO GAY
3268-59224-0029 THE FIRST PLACE I REACH IS A LINE OF DEFENCE IN COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION WHICH WILL BE THE SECOND LINE OF DEFENCE TO MEET THE IMPROBABLE EVENT OF THE FIRST LINE WHICH LIES FARTHER AHEAD HAVING TO BE ABANDONED
3268-59224-0030 IT WAS THE GERMANS I ADMIT WHOSE SCHEMING EVIL BRAINS DEVISED THIS WHOLE SYSTEM OF GALLERIES AND SNARES BUT WE MORE SUBTLE AND ALERT THAN THEY HAVE IN A FEW DAYS EQUALLED THEM IF WE HAVE NOT BEATEN THEM
3268-59224-0031 AT THEIR OWN GAME A MILE FARTHER ON IS THE FIRST LINE IT IS FULL OF SOLDIERS FOR THIS IS THE TRENCH THAT MUST WITHSTAND THE SHOCK OF THE BARBARIANS ONSET DAY AND NIGHT IT IS ALWAYS READY TO BRISTLE WITH RIFLES
3268-59224-0032 AND THEY WHO HOLD THE TRENCH GONE TO EARTH SCARCELY FOR A MOMENT KNOW THAT THEY MAY EXPECT AT ANY MINUTE THE DAILY SHOWER OF SHELLS THEN HEADS RASH ENOUGH TO SHOW THEMSELVES ABOVE THE PARAPET WILL BE SHOT AWAY BREASTS SHATTERED
3268-59224-0033 THEY KNOW HOW THEY WILL COME ON AT A RUN WITH SHOUTS INTENDED TO TERRIFY THEM LINKED ARM IN ARM INTO ONE INFURIATED MASS AND HOW THEY WILL FIND MEANS AS EVER TO DO MUCH HARM
3268-59224-0034 ALL THIS THEY KNOW FOR THEY HAVE ALREADY SEEN IT BUT NEVERTHELESS THEY SMILE A SERIOUS DIGNIFIED SMILE THEY HAVE BEEN NEARLY A WEEK IN THIS TRENCH WAITING TO BE RELIEVED AND THEY MAKE NO COMPLAINTS
3268-59224-0035 BUT NOT ALL OF US YET HAVE WOOLLEN UNDERCLOTHING FOR THE WINTER AND WE SHALL NEED IT SOON WHEN YOU GO BACK TO PARIS COLONEL PERHAPS YOU WILL BE SO KIND AS TO BRING THIS TO THE NOTICE OF GOVERNMENT AND OF ALL THE LADIES TOO
3268-59224-0036 THE TRENCH BELONG TO THE MOST DIVERSE SOCIAL GRADES
3268-59224-0037 SOME ARTISANS SOME DAY LABOURERS AND THERE ARE EVEN SOME WHO WEAR THEIR CAPS AT TOO RAKISH AN ANGLE AND WHOSE LANGUAGE SMACKS OF THE RING INTO WHOSE PAST IT IS BETTER NOT TO PRY TOO CURIOUSLY
3268-59224-0038 YET THEY HAVE BECOME NOT ONLY GOOD SOLDIERS BUT GOOD MEN FOR THIS WAR WHILE IT HAS DRAWN US CLOSER TOGETHER HAS AT THE SAME TIME PURIFIED US AND ENNOBLED US THIS BENEFIT AT LEAST THE GERMANS WILL
3268-59224-0039 INVOLUNTARILY HAVE BESTOWED UPON US AND INDEED IT IS WORTH THE TROUBLE MOREOVER OUR SOLDIERS ALL KNOW TO DAY WHY THEY ARE FIGHTING AND THEREIN LIES THEIR SUPREME STRENGTH
3268-59224-0040 THEIR INDIGNATION WILL INSPIRE THEM TILL THEIR LATEST BREATH WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN SAID TWO YOUNG BRETON PEASANTS TO ME WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN WITH YOUR OWN EYES WHAT THESE BRUTES DO IN THE VILLAGES THEY PASS THROUGH
3268-59224-0041 A TALK WITH ANY OF THESE SOLDIERS IS EQUALLY REASSURING AND CALLS FORTH THE SAME ADMIRATION BUT IT IS STRANGE TO REFLECT THAT IN THIS TWENTIETH CENTURY OF OURS IN ORDER TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM BARBARISM AND HORROR
3268-59224-0042 WE HAVE HAD TO ESTABLISH TRENCHES SUCH AS THESE IN DOUBLE AND TREBLE LINES CROSSING OUR DEAR COUNTRY FROM EAST TO WEST ALONG AN UNBROKEN FRONT OF HUNDREDS OF MILES LIKE A KIND OF GREAT WALL OF CHINA
3268-59224-0043 BUT A HUNDRED TIMES MORE FORMIDABLE THAN THE ORIGINAL WALL THE DEFENCE OF THE MONGOLIANS IS THIS WALL OF OURS A WALL PRACTICALLY SUBTERRANEAN WHICH WINDS ALONG STEALTHILY
3268-59224-0044 MANNED BY ALL THE HEROIC YOUTH OF FRANCE EVER ON THE ALERT EVER IN THE MIDST OF BLOODSHED THE TWILIGHT THIS EVENING UNDER THE SULLEN SKY LINGERS SADLY AND WILL NOT COME TO AN END
3268-59224-0045 IT APPEARED TO ME TO BEGIN TWO HOURS AGO AND YET IT IS STILL LIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE BEFORE US DISTINGUISHABLE AS YET TO SIGHT OR IMAGINATION LIE TWO SECTIONS OF A FOREST UNFOLDING ITSELF
3268-59224-0046 BEYOND RANGE OF VISION THE CONTOURS OF ITS MORE DISTANT SECTION ALMOST LOST IN DARKNESS COLDER STILL GROWS THE WIND AND MY HEART CONTRACTS WITH THE STILL MORE PAINFUL IMPRESSION OF A BACKWARD PLUNGE
3268-59224-0047 WITHOUT SHELTER AND WITHOUT REFUGE INTO PRIMEVAL BARBARISM EVERY EVENING AT THIS HOUR COLONEL FOR THE LAST WEEK WE HAVE HAD OUR LITTLE SHOWER OF SHELLS
3268-59224-0048 IF YOU HAVE TIME TO STAY A SHORT WHILE YOU WILL SEE HOW QUICKLY THEY FIRE AND ALMOST WITHOUT AIMING AS FOR TIME WELL I HAVE REALLY HARDLY ANY TO SPARE AND BESIDES
3268-59224-0049 NEVERTHELESS I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO STAY A FEW MINUTES LONGER AND TO WITNESS THE PERFORMANCE AGAIN IN THEIR COMPANY AH TO BE SURE A KIND OF WHIRRING IN THE AIR LIKE THE FLIGHT OF PARTRIDGES
3268-59224-0050 THEY CANNOT BE QUITE SO STUPID NEVERTHELESS WE STOP TALKING AND LISTEN WITH OUR EARS PRICKED A DOZEN SHELLS AND THEN NO MORE THEY HAVE FINISHED THE MEN TELL ME THEN THEIR HOUR IS OVER NOW
3268-59224-0051 AND IT WAS FOR OUR COMRADES DOWN THERE YOU HAVE NO LUCK COLONEL THIS IS THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT IT WAS NOT WE WHO CAUGHT IT AND BESIDES YOU WOULD THINK THEY WERE TIRED THIS EVENING THE BOCHES IT IS DARK
3268-59224-0052 AND I OUGHT TO BE FAR AWAY MOREOVER THEY ARE ALL GOING TO SLEEP FOR OBVIOUSLY THEY CANNOT RISK SHOWING A LIGHT CIGARETTES ARE THE LIMIT OF INDULGENCE I SHAKE HANDS WITH A WHOLE LINE OF SOLDIERS AND LEAVE THEM ASLEEP
