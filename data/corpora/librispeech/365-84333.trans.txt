365-84333-0000 THE HISTORY OF THIS ADVENTURER IS RENDERED MORE THAN USUALLY INTERESTING FROM THE FACT THAT SEVERAL AUTHORS HAVE TAKEN UP CUDGELS ON HIS BEHALF AND VEHEMENTLY ASSERT THAT HE WAS TRULY
365-84333-0001 THE MAN HE ASSERTED HIMSELF TO BE NOT ONLY AUTHORS INK BUT UNFORTUNATELY A GREAT QUANTITY OF HUMAN BLOOD WAS WASTED IN THE DISPUTE AND THAT TOO
365-84333-0002 WITHOUT THE WORLD BEING ANY THE WISER THE FACTS AS THEY ARE RECOUNTED BY HISTORIANS STAND THUS VOLDEMAR THE SECOND MARQUIS OF BRANDENBURG WAS THE THIRTEENTH
365-84333-0003 ELECTOR OF THE FAMILY OF THE COUNTS OF ASCAGNE A FAMILY CLOSELY RELATED
365-84333-0004 AND LEFT HIS BROTHER JOHN THE FOURTH IN POSSESSION OF HIS ELECTORATE HE STARTED UPON HIS PILGRIMAGE ATTENDED ONLY BY TWO MEN HE SET OFF ON HIS JOURNEY WITHOUT INFORMING HIS BROTHER OR ANY OF HIS SUBJECTS
365-84333-0005 WHAT ROUTE HE INTENDED TAKING OR INDEED FURNISHING INFORMATION OF ANY KIND RELATIVE TO HIS INTENTIONS VOLDEMAR AND HIS BROTHER JOHN WERE THE ONLY SURVIVING MEMBERS OF THE ELDER BRANCH OF THE HOUSE OF ASCAGNE
365-84333-0006 BUT PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE THE ROYAL PILGRIM OBLIGED HIS SUBJECTS TO SWEAR THAT IN THE EVENT OF HIM AND HIS BROTHER DYING CHILDLESS THEY WOULD RECEIVE FOR THEIR SOVEREIGN
365-84333-0007 WHICH WAS A BRANCH OF THE ASCAGNE FAMILY THIS WAS A D THIRTEEN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR DAYS AFTER VOLDEMAR'S DEPARTURE HIS BROTHER JOHN DIED SUDDENLY NOT WITHOUT SUSPICION THAT HE HAD BEEN POISONED
365-84333-0008 THE ABSENT ELECTOR APPARENTLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE SAD EVENT DID NOT RETURN AND IT WAS QUICKLY NOISED ABROAD HAD ALSO MET WITH A SUDDEN DEATH
365-84333-0009 THE EMPEROR LOUIS ACTING IN OPPOSITION TO ALL RIGHT SAVE THAT OF MIGHT INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THE DULY RECOGNIZED PRINCE TO SUCCEED TOOK POSSESSION OF THE ELECTORATE AND INVESTED HIS OWN SON LOUIS WITH IT
365-84333-0010 IN ORDER TO AFFORD A FAIR IDEA OF THIS PRETENDER'S CLAIMS IT WILL BE NECESSARY IN THE FIRST PLACE TO RECOUNT THE STORY OF HIS APPEARANCE AS DETAILED BY THE AUTHORS FAVOURING THE THEORY OF HIS BEING AN IMPOSTOR AND THEN
365-84333-0011 TO PRODUCE THE EVIDENCE OFFERED BY THOSE OF THE OPPOSITE PARTY ON HIS BEHALF THE RECEIVED OPINION IS THAT RUDOLPH
365-84333-0012 OF SAXONY AND BRANDENBURG VESTED IN ONE PERSON PRODUCED A CERTAIN MAN WHOM HE DOUBTLESS MEANT TO USE AS A TOOL THIS MAN HE DECLARED TO BE HIS DEAR COUSIN VOLDEMAR
365-84333-0013 WHO HAD DISAPPEARED NEARLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS PREVIOUSLY ON A PILGRIMAGE TO THE CHIEF PLACES OF THE HOLY LAND WHICH HE HAD IT WAS GIVEN FORTH VISITED BUT HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONER AND BEEN KEPT IN CAPTIVITY BY THE INFIDELS UNTIL RECENTLY
365-84333-0014 NAMED JACQUES REBOC HE WAS THEY MOREOVER ALLEGE AN HABITUAL LIAR AND A CUNNING VAGABOND POSSESSING SOME RESEMBLANCE IN FORM AND FACE TO THE LOST PRINCE SUCH RESEMBLANCE INDEED
365-84333-0015 DWELT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS IN SAXONY WHERE HE HAD BEEN WELL INSTRUCTED AS TO THE FORMER LIFE AND FAMILY CONNECTIONS OF THE DECEASED ELECTOR AS WELL AS PUT IN THE WAY OF COUNTERFEITING ON HIS PERSON
365-84333-0016 THE VARIOUS MARKS BY WHICH HE MIGHT DECEIVE THE WORLD THUS RUNS THE STORY AS TOLD BY THE ADVOCATES FOR THE IMPOSTURE THEORY PRESENTLY IT WILL BE SEEN WHAT CAN BE SAID ON THE OTHER SIDE WHILST NOW
365-84333-0017 IT WILL BE AS WELL TO HEAR WHAT HAPPENED UPON THE APPEARANCE OF THE CLAIMANT THE RUMOUR OF VOLDEMAR'S RETURN FROM A LONG AND PAINFUL CAPTIVITY IN TURKEY
365-84333-0018 IN A STATE OF INTENSE EXCITEMENT TO SEE
365-84333-0019 THE POPULACE AT ONCE DECLARED FOR HIM AND COMPELLED THE ELECTOR LOUIS TO RETIRE CHARLES THE FOURTH WHO HAD SUCCEEDED LOUIS THE FOURTH AS EMPEROR AND WAS ON BAD TERMS WITH THE ELECTOR LOUIS THE LATE MONARCH'S SON
365-84333-0020 DECLARED FOR THE CLAIMANT AS DID ALSO THE RULERS OF BRUNSWICK POMERANIA MECKLENBURG AND SEVERAL OTHERS INCLUDING VOLDEMAR'S RELATIVES THE DUKE OF SAXONY AND THE PRINCES OF ANHALT
365-84333-0021 THEY RECEIVED HIM BACK WITH TRANSPORTS OF JOY SUCH WAS THEIR ENTHUSIASM
365-84333-0022 INDEED AND THEIR DELIGHT AT BEING DELIVERED FROM THE DOMINION OF THE BAVARIANS WHO HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEIR COUNTRY AFTER IT HAD BEEN FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS GOVERNED BY THE HOUSE OF ASCAGNE THAT THEY FURNISHED THE SUPPOSED VOLDEMAR
365-84333-0023 BOUNTIFULLY WITH GOODS AND MONEY AND RENDERED HIM EVERY ASSISTANCE TOWARDS DRIVING OUT LOUIS ALMOST ALL THE TOWNS AND CITIES ACKNOWLEDGED HIS AUTHORITY AND PROMISED OBEDIENCE TO HIS RULE
365-84333-0024 THE KING OF DENMARK WHO SINGULARLY ENOUGH WAS ALSO NAMED VOLDEMAR AND BY SOME OTHER POTENTATES EQUALLY DESIROUS OF HAVING A HAND IN THEIR NEIGHBOUR'S AFFAIRS HE SOON FOUND HIMSELF ABLE TO PLACE A GOOD ARMY IN THE FIELD
365-84333-0025 THAT ENDURED FOR SOME YEARS NOW COMMENCED BETWEEN THE RIVAL ELECTORS BUT FINALLY VOLDEMAR INFLICTED SUCH A SIGNAL DEFEAT UPON HIS OPPONENT'S FORCES THAT LOUIS RELINQUISHED THE CONTEST IN DISGUST
365-84333-0026 AND RETIRED TO HIS DOMAINS IN THE TYROL MAKING OVER HIS CLAIM UPON BRANDENBURG TO HIS TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS THIS TRANSFERENCE OF THE ELECTORATE IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THE EMPEROR CHARLES AFTERWARDS
365-84333-0027 CONFIRMED BY LETTERS PATENT IN THIRTEEN FIFTY NOTWITHSTANDING THE CONTESTATION OF VOLDEMAR AND HIS PARTISANS ACCORDING TO THE POPULAR ACCOUNT THE PSEUDO VOLDEMAR WAS ULTIMATELY OVERTHROWN
365-84333-0028 THUS RUNS THE COMMONLY ACCREDITED STORY BUT SUMMING UP LATER AND EQUALLY RELIABLE RECORDS THE FAVOURERS OF THE IDEA THAT IT WAS REALLY THE ELECTOR HIMSELF WHO REAPPEARED PUT THE CASE THUS
365-84333-0029 THE ARCHBISHOP OF MAGDEBURG PRIMATE OF GERMANY A MAN TOTALLY UNINTERESTED EITHER WAY AND KNOWN FOR HIS PROBITY WOULD NOT THEY SAY HAVE RECOGNISED AND HAVE GIVEN HIS TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF THE CLAIMANT
365-84333-0030 MOREOVER ONE HISTORIAN SHOWS FROM CONTEMPORARY RECORDS
365-84333-0031 THE STATEMENT AS TO HIS DECEASE IN THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO IS THEY POINT OUT CONTRADICTORY WHILST HAD THE ELECTOR LOUIS KNOWN OF HIS PREDECESSOR'S DEATH WHY DID HE NOT PROCURE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF THE SAME
365-84333-0032 THE EMPEROR LOUIS WAS KNOWN MOREOVER TO HAVE ENTERTAINED GREAT HATRED AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ASCAGNE IN CONSEQUENCE OF ITS CHIEFS RUDOLPH OF SAXONY AND VOLDEMAR THE FIRST UNCLE OF THE SECOND VOLDEMAR
365-84333-0033 HAVING DECLARED FOR HIS RIVAL FOR THE EMPIRE FREDERICK OF AUSTRIA IN THIRTEEN THIRTEEN WHAT HOWEVER CHIEFLY CONFIRMS THEIR VIEW OF THE CASE IN THE EYES OF THE CLAIMANT'S ADVOCATES IS
365-84333-0034 NOT ONLY DID VOLDEMAR'S RELATIVES THE DUKE OF SAXONY AND THE PRINCES OF ANHALT AND THAT APPARENTLY CONTRARY TO THEIR INTEREST ACKNOWLEDGE THE WANDERER BUT THEY EVEN
365-84333-0035 IN THE CHAPEL DU SAINT ESPRIT WHICH WAS THE GENERAL PLACE OF SEPULTURE
