3196-151981-0000 THE DAYS PASSED AND MISTER TULLIVER SHOWED AT LEAST TO THE EYES OF THE MEDICAL MAN STRONGER AND STRONGER SYMPTOMS OF A GRADUAL RETURN TO HIS NORMAL CONDITION THE PARALYTIC OBSTRUCTION WAS LITTLE BY LITTLE LOSING ITS TENACITY
3196-151981-0001 AND THE MIND WAS RISING FROM UNDER IT WITH FITFUL STRUGGLES LIKE A LIVING CREATURE MAKING ITS WAY FROM UNDER A GREAT SNOWDRIFT THAT SLIDES AND SLIDES AGAIN AND SHUTS UP THE NEWLY MADE OPENING TIME WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO CREEP TO THE WATCHERS BY THE BED
3196-151981-0002 IF IT HAD ONLY BEEN MEASURED BY THE DOUBTFUL DISTANT HOPE WHICH KEPT COUNT OF THE MOMENTS WITHIN THE CHAMBER BUT IT WAS MEASURED FOR THEM BY A FAST APPROACHING DREAD WHICH MADE THE NIGHTS COME TOO QUICKLY
3196-151981-0003 WHILE MISTER TULLIVER WAS SLOWLY BECOMING HIMSELF AGAIN HIS LOT WAS HASTENING TOWARD ITS MOMENT OF MOST PALPABLE CHANGE THE TAXING MASTERS HAD DONE THEIR WORK LIKE ANY RESPECTABLE GUNSMITH CONSCIENTIOUSLY PREPARING THE MUSKET THAT DULY POINTED BY A BRAVE ARM WILL SPOIL A LIFE OR TWO
3196-151981-0004 ALLOCATURS FILING OF BILLS IN CHANCERY DECREES OF SALE ARE LEGAL CHAIN SHOT OR BOMB SHELLS THAT CAN NEVER HIT A SOLITARY MARK BUT MUST FALL WITH WIDESPREAD SHATTERING SO DEEPLY INHERENT IS IT IN THIS LIFE OF OURS THAT MEN HAVE TO SUFFER FOR EACH OTHER'S SINS
3196-151981-0005 SO INEVITABLY DIFFUSIVE IS HUMAN SUFFERING THAT EVEN JUSTICE MAKES ITS VICTIMS AND WE CAN CONCEIVE NO RETRIBUTION THAT DOES NOT SPREAD BEYOND ITS MARK IN PULSATIONS OF UNMERITED PAIN BY THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND WEEK IN JANUARY THE BILLS WERE OUT ADVERTISING THE SALE
3196-151981-0006 UNDER A DECREE OF CHANCERY OF MISTER TULLIVER'S FARMING AND OTHER STOCK TO BE FOLLOWED BY A SALE OF THE MILL AND LAND HELD IN THE PROPER AFTER DINNER HOUR AT THE GOLDEN LION
3196-151981-0007 THE MILLER HIMSELF UNAWARE OF THE LAPSE OF TIME FANCIED HIMSELF STILL IN THAT FIRST STAGE OF HIS MISFORTUNES WHEN EXPEDIENTS MIGHT BE THOUGHT OF AND OFTEN IN HIS CONSCIOUS HOURS TALKED IN A FEEBLE DISJOINTED MANNER OF PLANS HE WOULD CARRY OUT WHEN HE GOT WELL
3196-151981-0008 THE WIFE AND CHILDREN WERE NOT WITHOUT HOPE OF AN ISSUE THAT WOULD AT LEAST SAVE MISTER TULLIVER FROM LEAVING THE OLD SPOT AND SEEKING AN ENTIRELY STRANGE LIFE FOR UNCLE DEANE HAD BEEN INDUCED TO INTEREST HIMSELF IN THIS STAGE OF THE BUSINESS
3196-151981-0009 IT WOULD NOT HE ACKNOWLEDGED BE A BAD SPECULATION FOR GUEST AND CO TO BUY DORLCOTE MILL AND CARRY ON THE BUSINESS WHICH WAS A GOOD ONE AND MIGHT BE INCREASED BY THE ADDITION OF STEAM POWER IN WHICH CASE TULLIVER MIGHT BE RETAINED AS MANAGER
3196-151981-0010 STILL MISTER DEANE WOULD SAY NOTHING DECIDED ABOUT THE MATTER THE FACT THAT WAKEM HELD THE MORTGAGE ON THE LAND MIGHT PUT IT INTO HIS HEAD TO BID FOR THE WHOLE ESTATE AND FURTHER TO OUTBID THE CAUTIOUS FIRM OF GUEST AND CO WHO DID NOT CARRY ON BUSINESS ON SENTIMENTAL GROUNDS
3196-151981-0011 MISTER DEANE WAS OBLIGED TO TELL MISSUS TULLIVER SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT WHEN HE RODE OVER TO THE MILL TO INSPECT THE BOOKS IN COMPANY WITH MISSUS GLEGG FOR SHE HAD OBSERVED THAT IF GUEST AND CO WOULD ONLY THINK ABOUT IT MISTER TULLIVER'S FATHER AND GRANDFATHER HAD BEEN CARRYING ON DORLCOTE MILL
3196-151981-0012 LONG BEFORE THE OIL MILL OF THAT FIRM HAD BEEN SO MUCH AS THOUGHT OF MISTER DEANE IN REPLY DOUBTED WHETHER THAT WAS PRECISELY THE RELATION BETWEEN THE TWO MILLS WHICH WOULD DETERMINE THEIR VALUE AS INVESTMENTS AS FOR UNCLE GLEGG THE THING LAY QUITE BEYOND HIS IMAGINATION
3196-151981-0013 THE GOOD NATURED MAN FELT SINCERE PITY FOR THE TULLIVER FAMILY BUT HIS MONEY WAS ALL LOCKED UP IN EXCELLENT MORTGAGES AND HE COULD RUN NO RISK THAT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO HIS OWN RELATIVES BUT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT TULLIVER SHOULD HAVE SOME NEW FLANNEL WAISTCOATS
3196-151981-0014 ONE DAY HE HAD BROUGHT LUCY WHO WAS COME HOME FOR THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS AND THE LITTLE BLOND ANGEL HEAD HAD PRESSED ITSELF AGAINST MAGGIE'S DARKER CHEEK WITH MANY KISSES AND SOME TEARS THESE FAIR SLIM DAUGHTERS KEEP UP A TENDER SPOT IN THE HEART OF MANY A RESPECTABLE PARTNER IN A RESPECTABLE FIRM
3196-151981-0015 AND PERHAPS LUCY'S ANXIOUS PITYING QUESTIONS ABOUT HER POOR COUSINS HELPED TO MAKE UNCLE DEANE MORE PROMPT IN FINDING TOM A TEMPORARY PLACE IN THE WAREHOUSE AND IN PUTTING HIM IN THE WAY OF GETTING EVENING LESSONS IN BOOK KEEPING AND CALCULATION
3196-151981-0016 THAT MIGHT HAVE CHEERED THE LAD AND FED HIS HOPES A LITTLE IF THERE HAD NOT COME AT THE SAME TIME THE MUCH DREADED BLOW OF FINDING THAT HIS FATHER MUST BE A BANKRUPT AFTER ALL AT LEAST THE CREDITORS MUST BE ASKED TO TAKE LESS THAN THEIR DUE WHICH TO TOM'S UNTECHNICAL MIND WAS THE SAME THING AS BANKRUPTCY
3196-151981-0017 HIS FATHER MUST NOT ONLY BE SAID TO HAVE LOST HIS PROPERTY BUT TO HAVE FAILED THE WORD THAT CARRIED THE WORST OBLOQUY TO TOM'S MIND FOR WHEN THE DEFENDANT'S CLAIM FOR COSTS HAD BEEN SATISFIED THERE WOULD REMAIN THE FRIENDLY BILL OF MISTER GORE AND THE DEFICIENCY AT THE BANK AS WELL AS THE OTHER DEBTS
3196-151981-0018 WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ASSETS SHRINK INTO UNEQUIVOCAL DISPROPORTION NOT MORE THAN TEN OR TWELVE SHILLINGS IN THE POUND PREDICTED MISTER DEANE IN A DECIDED TONE TIGHTENING HIS LIPS AND THE WORDS FELL ON TOM LIKE A SCALDING LIQUIED LEAVING A CONTINUAL SMART
3196-151981-0019 HE WAS SADLY IN WANT OF SOMETHING TO KEEP UP HIS SPIRITS A LITTLE IN THE UNPLEASANT NEWNESS OF HIS POSITION
3196-151981-0020 AND THE BUSY IDLENESS OF CASTLE BUILDING IN A LAST HALF AT SCHOOL TO THE COMPANIONSHIP OF SACKS AND HIDES AND BAWLING MEN THUNDERING DOWN HEAVY WEIGHTS AT HIS ELBOW THE FIRST STEP TOWARD GETTING ON IN THE WORLD WAS A CHILL DUSTY NOISY AFFAIR
3196-151981-0021 AND IMPLIED GOING WITHOUT ONE'S TEA IN ORDER TO STAY IN SAINT OGG'S AND HAVE AN EVENING LESSON FROM A ONE ARMED ELDERLY CLERK IN A ROOM SMELLING STRONGLY OF BAD TOBACCO TOM'S YOUNG PINK AND WHITE FACE HAD ITS COLORS VERY MUCH DEADENED BY THE TIME HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT AT HOME
3196-151981-0022 AND SAT DOWN WITH KEEN HUNGER TO HIS SUPPER NO WONDER HE WAS A LITTLE CROSS IF HIS MOTHER OR MAGGIE SPOKE TO HIM BUT ALL THIS WHILE MISSUS TULLIVER WAS BROODING OVER A SCHEME BY WHICH SHE AND NO ONE ELSE WOULD AVERT THE RESULT MOST TO BE DREADED
3196-151981-0023 AND PREVENT WAKEM FROM ENTERTAINING THE PURPOSE OF BIDDING FOR THE MILL IMAGINE A TRULY RESPECTABLE AND AMIABLE HEN BY SOME PORTENTOUS ANOMALY TAKING TO REFLECTION AND INVENTING COMBINATIONS BY WHICH SHE MIGHT PREVAIL ON HODGE NOT TO WRING HER NECK OR SEND HER AND HER CHICKS TO MARKET
3196-151981-0024 THE RESULT COULD HARDLY BE OTHER THAN MUCH CACKLING AND FLUTTERING MISSUS TULLIVER SEEING THAT EVERYTHING HAD GONE WRONG HAD BEGUN TO THINK SHE HAD BEEN TOO PASSIVE IN LIFE AND THAT IF SHE HAD APPLIED HER MIND TO BUSINESS AND TAKEN A STRONG RESOLUTION NOW AND THEN
3196-151981-0025 NOBODY IT APPEARED HAD THOUGHT OF GOING TO SPEAK TO WAKEM ON THIS BUSINESS OF THE MILL AND YET MISSUS TULLIVER REFLECTED
3196-151981-0026 EVEN IF HE HAD BEEN ABLE AND WILLING FOR HE HAD BEEN GOING TO LAW AGAINST WAKEM AND ABUSING HIM FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS
3196-151981-0027 AND NOW THAT MISSUS TULLIVER HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HER HUSBAND WAS VERY MUCH IN THE WRONG TO BRING HER INTO THIS TROUBLE SHE WAS INCLINED TO THINK THAT HIS OPINION OF WAKEM WAS WRONG TOO TO BE SURE WAKEM HAD PUT THE BAILIES IN THE HOUSE AND SOLD THEM UP BUT SHE SUPPOSED HE DID THAT TO PLEASE THE MAN THAT LENT MISTER TULLIVER THE MONEY
3196-151981-0028 FOR A LAWYER HAD MORE FOLKS TO PLEASE THAN ONE AND HE WASN'T LIKELY TO PUT MISTER TULLIVER WHO HAD GONE TO LAW WITH HIM ABOVE EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD
3196-151981-0029 AND AT THE TIME MISSUS TULLIVER HAD HEARD OF THAT MARRIAGE THE SUMMER WHEN SHE WORE HER BLUE SATIN SPENCER AND HAD NOT YET ANY THOUGHTS OF MISTER TULLIVER SHE KNEW NO HARM OF WAKEM AND CERTAINLY TOWARD HERSELF WHOM HE KNEW TO HAVE BEEN A MISS DODSON IT WAS OUT OF ALL POSSIBILITY THAT HE COULD ENTERTAIN ANYTHING BUT GOOD WILL
3196-151981-0030 WHEN IT WAS ONCE BROUGHT HOME TO HIS OBSERVATION THAT SHE FOR HER PART HAD NEVER WANTED TO GO TO LAW AND INDEED WAS AT PRESENT DISPOSED TO TAKE MISTER WAKEM'S VIEW OF ALL SUBJECTS RATHER THAN HER HUSBAND'S IN FACT IF THAT ATTORNEY SAW A RESPECTABLE MATRON LIKE HERSELF DISPOSED TO GIVE HIM GOOD WORDS
3196-151981-0031 WHY SHOULDN'T HE LISTEN TO HER REPRESENTATIONS FOR SHE WOULD PUT THE MATTER CLEARLY BEFORE HIM WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN DONE YET AND HE WOULD NEVER GO AND BID FOR THE MILL ON PURPOSE TO SPITE HER AN INNOCENT WOMAN WHO THOUGHT IT LIKELY ENOUGH THAT SHE HAD DANCED WITH HIM IN THEIR YOUTH AT SQUIRE DARLEIGH'S
3196-151981-0032 FOR AT THOSE BIG DANCES SHE HAD OFTEN AND OFTEN DANCED WITH YOUNG MEN WHOSE NAMES SHE HAD FORGOTTEN MISSUS TULLIVER HID THESE REASONINGS IN HER OWN BOSOM FOR WHEN SHE HAD THROWN OUT A HINT TO MISTER DEANE AND MISTER GLEGG THAT SHE WOULDN'T MIND GOING TO SPEAK TO WAKEM HERSELF THEY HAD SAID
3196-151981-0033 NO NO NO AND POOH POOH AND LET WAKEM ALONE IN THE TONE OF MEN WHO WERE NOT LIKELY TO GIVE A CANDID ATTENTION TO A MORE DEFINITE EXPOSITION OF HER PROJECT STILL LESS DARED SHE MENTION THE PLAN TO TOM AND MAGGIE FOR THE CHILDREN WERE ALWAYS SO AGAINST EVERYTHING THEIR MOTHER SAID AND TOM SHE OBSERVED
3196-151981-0034 WAS ALMOST AS MUCH SET AGAINST WAKEM AS HIS FATHER WAS BUT THIS UNUSUAL CONCENTRATION OF THOUGHT NATURALLY GAVE MISSUS TULLIVER AN UNUSUAL POWER OF DEVICE AND DETERMINATION AND A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THE SALE TO BE HELD AT THE GOLDEN LION
3196-151981-0035 WHEN THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY TIME TO BE LOST SHE CARRIED OUT HER PLAN BY A STRATAGEM THERE WERE PICKLES IN QUESTION A LARGE STOCK OF PICKLES AND KETCHUP WHICH MISSUS TULLIVER POSSESSED
3196-151981-0036 SO SHE WOULD WALK WITH TOM TO SAINT OGG'S THAT MORNING AND WHEN TOM URGED THAT SHE MIGHT LET THE PICKLES BE AT PRESENT HE DIDN'T LIKE HER TO GO ABOUT JUST YET SHE APPEARED SO HURT AT THIS CONDUCT IN HER SON CONTRADICTING HER ABOUT PICKLES WHICH SHE HAD MADE AFTER THE FAMILY RECEIPTS INHERITED FROM HIS OWN GRANDMOTHER
3196-151981-0037 WHO HAD DIED WHEN HIS MOTHER WAS A LITTLE GIRL THAT HE GAVE WAY AND THEY WALKED TOGETHER UNTIL SHE TURNED TOWARD DANISH STREET WHERE MISTER HYNDMARSH RETAILED HIS GROCERY NOT FAR FROM THE OFFICES OF MISTER WAKEM THAT GENTLEMAN WAS NOT YET COME TO HIS OFFICE
3196-151981-0038 WOULD MISSUS TULLIVER SIT DOWN BY THE FIRE IN HIS PRIVATE ROOM AND WAIT FOR HIM SHE HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT BEFORE THE PUNCTUAL ATTORNEY ENTERED KNITTING HIS BROW WITH AN EXAMINING GLANCE AT THE STOUT BLOND WOMAN WHO ROSE CURTSYING DEFERENTIALLY
3196-151981-0039 A TALLISH MAN WITH AN AQUILINE NOSE AND ABUNDANT IRON GRAY HAIR YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN MISTER WAKEM BEFORE AND ARE POSSIBLY WONDERING WHETHER HE WAS REALLY AS EMINENT A RASCAL AND AS CRAFTY BITTER AN ENEMY OF HONEST HUMANITY IN GENERAL AND OF MISTER TULLIVER IN PARTICULAR
3196-151981-0040 OR PORTRAIT OF HIM WHICH WE HAVE SEEN TO EXIST IN THE MILLER'S MIND IT IS CLEAR THAT THE IRASCIBLE MILLER WAS A MAN TO INTERPRET ANY CHANCE SHOT THAT GRAZED HIM AS AN ATTEMPT ON HIS OWN LIFE AND WAS LIABLE TO ENTANGLEMENTS IN THIS PUZZLING WORLD WHICH DUE CONSIDERATION HAD TO HIS OWN INFALLIBILITY
3196-151981-0041 REQUIRED THE HYPOTHESIS OF A VERY ACTIVE DIABOLICAL AGENCY TO EXPLAIN THEM IT IS STILL POSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT THE ATTORNEY WAS NOT MORE GUILTY TOWARD HIM THAN AN INGENIOUS MACHINE WHICH PERFORMS ITS WORK WITH MUCH REGULARITY IS GUILTY TOWARD THE RASH MAN WHO
3196-151981-0042 VENTURING TOO NEAR IT IS CAUGHT UP BY SOME FLY WHEEL OR OTHER AND SUDDENLY CONVERTED INTO UNEXPECTED MINCE MEAT BUT IT IS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DECIDE THIS QUESTION BY A GLANCE AT HIS PERSON THE LINES AND LIGHTS OF THE HUMAN COUNTENANCE ARE LIKE OTHER SYMBOLS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO READ WITHOUT A KEY
3196-151981-0043 ON AN A PRIORI VIEW OF WAKEM'S AQUILINE NOSE WHICH OFFENDED MISTER TULLIVER THERE WAS NOT MORE RASCALITY THAN IN THE SHAPE OF HIS STIFF SHIRT COLLAR THOUGH THIS TOO ALONG WITH HIS NOSE MIGHT HAVE BECOME FRAUGHT WITH DAMNATORY MEANING WHEN ONCE THE RASCALITY WAS ASCERTAINED MISSUS TULLIVER I THINK SAID MISTER WAKEM
3196-151981-0044 YES SIR MISS ELIZABETH DODSON AS WAS PRAY BE SEATED YOU HAVE SOME BUSINESS WITH ME WELL SIR YES SAID MISSUS TULLIVER BEGINNING TO FEEL ALARMED AT HER OWN COURAGE NOW SHE WAS REALLY IN PRESENCE OF THE FORMIDABLE MAN
3196-151981-0045 AND REFLECTING THAT SHE HAD NOT SETTLED WITH HERSELF HOW SHE SHOULD BEGIN MISTER WAKEM FELT IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKETS AND LOOKED AT HER IN SILENCE I HOPE SIR SHE BEGAN AT LAST I HOPE SIR YOU'RE NOT A THINKING AS I BEAR YOU ANY ILL WILL BECAUSE O MY HUSBAND'S LOSING HIS LAWSUIT
3196-151981-0046 AND THE BAILIES BEING PUT IN AND THE LINEN BEING SOLD OH DEAR FOR I WASN'T BROUGHT UP IN THAT WAY I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER MY FATHER SIR FOR HE WAS CLOSE FRIENDS WITH SQUIRE DARLEIGH AND WE ALLAYS WENT TO THE DANCES THERE THE MISS DODSONS
3196-151981-0047 NOBODY COULD BE MORE LOOKED ON AND JUSTLY FOR THERE WAS FOUR OF US AND YOU'RE QUITE AWARE AS MISSUS GLEGG AND MISSUS DEANE ARE MY SISTERS AND AS FOR GOING TO LAW AND LOSING MONEY AND HAVING SALES BEFORE YOU'RE DEAD I NEVER SAW ANYTHING O THAT BEFORE I WAS MARRIED NOR FOR A LONG WHILE AFTER
3196-151981-0048 MISSUS TULLIVER SHOOK HER HEAD A LITTLE AND LOOKED AT THE HEM OF HER POCKET HANDKERCHIEF I'VE NO DOUBT OF WHAT YOU SAY MISSUS TULLIVER SAID MISTER WAKEM WITH COLD POLITENESS BUT YOU HAVE SOME QUESTION TO ASK ME
3196-151981-0049 I'VE SAID YOU'D HAD SOME NAT'RAL FEELING
3196-151981-0050 NOT BUT WHAT THERE'S WORSE MEN FOR HE NEVER WRONGED NOBODY OF A SHILLING NOR A PENNY NOT WILLINGLY
3196-151981-0051 BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE BUT WHAT YOU'LL BEHAVE AS A GENTLEMAN WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN MISSUS TULLIVER SAID MISTER WAKEM RATHER SHARPLY WHAT DO YOU WANT TO ASK ME
3196-151981-0052 IF YOU'LL BE SO GOOD NOT TO BUY THE MILL AN THE LAND
3196-151981-0053 SOMETHING LIKE A NEW THOUGHT FLASHED ACROSS MISTER WAKEM'S FACE AS HE SAID WHO TOLD YOU I MEANT TO BUY IT WHY SIR IT'S NONE O MY INVENTING
3196-151981-0054 FOR MY HUSBAND AS OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THE LAW HE ALLAYS USED TO SAY AS LAWYERS HAD NEVER NO CALL TO BUY ANYTHING EITHER LANDS OR HOUSES
3196-151981-0055 AN I SHOULD THINK THAT UD BE THE WAY WITH YOU SIR AND I NIVER SAID AS YOU'D BE THE MAN TO DO CONTRAIRY TO THAT AH WELL WHO WAS IT THAT DID SAY SO SAID WAKEM OPENING HIS DESK AND MOVING THINGS ABOUT WITH THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF AN ALMOST INAUDIBLE WHISTLE
3196-151981-0056 FOR IT WAS HIS FATHER'S BEFORE HIM THE MILL WAS AND HIS GRANDFATHER BUILT IT THOUGH I WASN'T FOND O THE NOISE OF IT WHEN FIRST I WAS MARRIED FOR THERE WAS NO MILLS IN OUR FAMILY NOT THE DODSON'S
3196-151981-0057 BUT I WENT INTO IT BLINDFOLD THAT I DID ERIGATION AND EVERYTHING
3196-151981-0058 OH DEAR SIR IT'S HARD TO THINK OF SAID POOR MISSUS TULLIVER A LITTLE TEAR MAKING ITS WAY
3196-151981-0059 AND IF YOU'LL ONLY THINK IF YOU WAS TO BID FOR THE MILL AND BUY IT MY HUSBAND MIGHT BE STRUCK WORSE THAN HE WAS BEFORE AND NIVER GET BETTER AGAIN AS HE'S GETTING NOW WELL BUT IF I BOUGHT THE MILL AND ALLOWED YOUR HUSBAND TO ACT AS MY MANAGER IN THE SAME WAY HOW THEN SAID MISTER WAKEM
3196-151981-0060 OH SIR I DOUBT HE COULD NIVER BE GOT TO DO IT NOT IF THE VERY MILL STOOD STILL TO BEG AND PRAY OF HIM FOR YOUR NAME'S LIKE POISON TO HIM IT'S SO AS NEVER WAS AND HE LOOKS UPON IT AS YOU'VE BEEN THE RUIN OF HIM ALL ALONG EVER SINCE YOU SET THE LAW ON HIM ABOUT THE ROAD THROUGH THE MEADOW
3196-151981-0061 AS I'VE ALLAYS TOLD HIM HE WAS WRONG HE'S A PIG HEADED FOUL MOUTHED FOOL BURST OUT MISTER WAKEM FORGETTING HIMSELF OH DEAR SIR SAID MISSUS TULLIVER FRIGHTENED AT A RESULT SO DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE SHE HAD FIXED HER MIND ON
3196-151981-0062 I WOULDN'T WISH TO CONTRADICT YOU BUT IT'S LIKE ENOUGH HE'S CHANGED HIS MIND WITH THIS ILLNESS HE'S FORGOT A MANY THINGS HE USED TO TALK ABOUT
3196-151981-0063 AND THE WATER MIGHT ALL RUN AWAY AND THEN NOT AS I'M WISHING YOU ANY ILL LUCK SIR FOR I FORGOT TO TELL YOU AS I REMEMBER YOUR WEDDING AS IF IT WAS YESTERDAY MISSUS WAKEM WAS A MISS CLINT I KNOW THAT
3196-151981-0064 YOU MUST EXCUSE ME FOR INTERRUPTING YOU MISSUS TULLIVER I HAVE BUSINESS THAT MUST BE ATTENDED TO AND I THINK THERE IS NOTHING MORE NECESSARY TO BE SAID BUT IF YOU WOULD BEAR IT IN MIND SIR SAID MISSUS TULLIVER RISING AND NOT RUN AGAINST ME AND MY CHILDREN AND I'M NOT DENYING MISTER TULLIVER'S BEEN IN THE WRONG
3196-151981-0065 BUT HE'S BEEN PUNISHED ENOUGH AND THERE'S WORSE MEN FOR IT'S BEEN GIVING TO OTHER FOLKS HAS BEEN HIS FAULT HE'S DONE NOBODY ANY HARM BUT HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY THE MORE'S THE PITY
3196-151981-0066 YES YES I'LL BEAR IT IN MIND SAID MISTER WAKEM HASTILY LOOKING TOWARD THE OPEN DOOR AND IF YOU'D PLEASE NOT TO SAY AS I'VE BEEN TO SPEAK TO YOU FOR MY SON UD BE VERY ANGRY WITH ME FOR DEMEANING MYSELF I KNOW HE WOULD AND I'VE TROUBLE ENOUGH WITHOUT BEING SCOLDED BY MY CHILDREN
3196-151981-0067 POOR MISSUS TULLIVER'S VOICE TREMBLED A LITTLE AND SHE COULD MAKE NO ANSWER TO THE ATTORNEY'S GOOD MORNING BUT CURTSIED AND WALKED OUT IN SILENCE WHICH DAY IS IT THAT DORLCOTE MILL IS TO BE SOLD WHERE'S THE BILL SAID MISTER WAKEM TO HIS CLERK WHEN THEY WERE ALONE
3196-151981-0068 NEXT FRIDAY IS THE DAY FRIDAY AT SIX O'CLOCK OH JUST RUN TO WINSHIP'S THE AUCTIONEER AND SEE IF HE'S AT HOME I HAVE SOME BUSINESS FOR HIM ASK HIM TO COME UP
3196-151981-0069 HIS MIND WAS ALREADY MADE UP MISSUS TULLIVER HAD SUGGESTED TO HIM SEVERAL DETERMINING MOTIVES AND HIS MENTAL GLANCE WAS VERY RAPID HE WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO CAN BE PROMPT WITHOUT BEING RASH BECAUSE THEIR MOTIVES RUN IN FIXED TRACKS AND THEY HAVE NO NEED TO RECONCILE CONFLICTING AIMS
3196-151981-0070 TO SUPPOSE THAT WAKEM HAD THE SAME SORT OF INVETERATE HATRED TOWARD TULLIVER THAT TULLIVER HAD TOWARD HIM WOULD BE LIKE SUPPOSING THAT A PIKE AND A ROACH CAN LOOK AT EACH OTHER FROM A SIMILAR POINT OF VIEW THE ROACH NECESSARILY ABHORS THE MODE IN WHICH THE PIKE GETS HIS LIVING
3196-151981-0071 AND THE PIKE IS LIKELY TO THINK NOTHING FURTHER EVEN OF THE MOST INDIGNANT ROACH THAN THAT HE IS EXCELLENT GOOD EATING IT COULD ONLY BE WHEN THE ROACH CHOKED HIM THAT THE PIKE COULD ENTERTAIN A STRONG PERSONAL ANIMOSITY
3196-151981-0072 WAKEM WOULD NOT HAVE REFUSED HIM THE DISTINCTION OF BEING A SPECIAL OBJECT OF HIS VINDICTIVENESS BUT WHEN MISTER TULLIVER CALLED WAKEM A RASCAL AT THE MARKET DINNER TABLE
3196-151981-0073 STIMULATED BY OPPORTUNITY AND BRANDY MADE A THRUST AT HIM BY ALLUDING TO OLD LADIES WILLS
3196-151981-0074 THAT IS TO SAY A MAN WHO ALWAYS KNEW THE STEPPING STONES THAT WOULD CARRY HIM THROUGH VERY MUDDY BITS OF PRACTICE A MAN WHO HAD MADE A LARGE FORTUNE HAD A HANDSOME HOUSE AMONG THE TREES AT TOFTON AND DECIDEDLY THE FINEST STOCK OF PORT WINE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SAINT OGG'S
3196-151981-0075 SINCE I HAVE UNDERSTOOD FROM PERSONS VERSED IN HISTORY THAT MANKIND IS NOT DISPOSED TO LOOK NARROWLY INTO THE CONDUCT OF GREAT VICTORS WHEN THEIR VICTORY IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE TULLIVER THEN COULD BE NO OBSTRUCTION TO WAKEM ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS A POOR DEVIL WHOM THE LAWYER HAD DEFEATED SEVERAL TIMES
3196-151981-0076 A HOT TEMPERED FELLOW WHO WOULD ALWAYS GIVE YOU A HANDLE AGAINST HIM
3196-151981-0077 THE SUCCESSFUL YELLOW CANDIDATE FOR THE BOROUGH OF OLD TOPPING PERHAPS FEELS NO PURSUANT MEDITATIVE HATRED TOWARD THE BLUE EDITOR WHO CONSOLES HIS SUBSCRIBERS WITH VITUPERATIVE RHETORIC AGAINST YELLOW MEN WHO SELL THEIR COUNTRY AND ARE THE DEMONS OF PRIVATE LIFE BUT HE MIGHT NOT BE SORRY IF LAW AND OPPORTUNITY FAVORED
3196-151981-0078 TO KICK THAT BLUE EDITOR TO A DEEPER SHADE OF HIS FAVORITE COLOR PROSPEROUS MEN TAKE A LITTLE VENGEANCE NOW AND THEN AS THEY TAKE A DIVERSION WHEN IT COMES EASILY IN THEIR WAY AND IS NO HINDRANCE TO BUSINESS AND SUCH SMALL UNIMPASSIONED REVENGES HAVE AN ENORMOUS EFFECT IN LIFE
3196-151981-0079 RUNNING THROUGH ALL DEGREES OF PLEASANT INFLICTION BLOCKING THE FIT MEN OUT OF PLACES AND BLACKENING CHARACTERS IN UNPREMEDITATED TALK STILL MORE TO SEE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ONLY INSIGNIFICANTLY OFFENSIVE TO US REDUCED IN LIFE AND HUMILIATED WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL EFFORT OF OURS
3196-151981-0080 IS APT TO HAVE A SOOTHING FLATTERING INFLUENCE PROVIDENCE OR SOME OTHER PRINCE OF THIS WORLD IT APPEARS HAS UNDERTAKEN THE TASK OF RETRIBUTION FOR US AND REALLY BY AN AGREEABLE CONSTITUTION OF THINGS OUR ENEMIES SOMEHOW DON'T PROSPER
3196-151981-0081 WAKEM WAS NOT WITHOUT THIS PARENTHETIC VINDICTIVENESS TOWARD THE UNCOMPLIMENTARY MILLER AND NOW MISSUS TULLIVER HAD PUT THE NOTION INTO HIS HEAD IT PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM AS A PLEASURE TO DO THE VERY THING THAT WOULD CAUSE MISTER TULLIVER THE MOST DEADLY MORTIFICATION AND A PLEASURE OF A COMPLEX KIND
3196-151981-0082 NOT MADE UP OF CRUDE MALICE BUT MINGLING WITH IT THE RELISH OF SELF APPROBATION TO SEE AN ENEMY HUMILIATED GIVES A CERTAIN CONTENTMENT BUT THIS IS JEJUNE COMPARED WITH THE HIGHLY BLENT SATISFACTION OF SEEING HIM HUMILIATED BY YOUR BENEVOLENT ACTION OR CONCESSION ON HIS BEHALF
3196-151981-0083 THAT IS A SORT OF REVENGE WHICH FALLS INTO THE SCALE OF VIRTUE AND WAKEM WAS NOT WITHOUT AN INTENTION OF KEEPING THAT SCALE RESPECTABLY FILLED HE HAD ONCE HAD THE PLEASURE OF PUTTING AN OLD ENEMY OF HIS INTO ONE OF THE SAINT OGG'S ALMS HOUSES TO THE REBUILDING OF WHICH HE HAD GIVEN A LARGE SUBSCRIPTION
3196-151981-0084 SUCH THINGS GIVE A COMPLETENESS TO PROSPERITY AND CONTRIBUTE ELEMENTS OF AGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ARE NOT DREAMED OF BY THAT SHORT SIGHTED OVERHEATED VINDICTIVENESS WHICH GOES OUT ITS WAY TO WREAK ITSELF IN DIRECT INJURY
3196-151981-0085 WOULD MAKE A BETTER SERVANT THAN ANY CHANCE FELLOW WHO WAS CAP IN HAND FOR A SITUATION TULLIVER WAS KNOWN TO BE A MAN OF PROUD HONESTY AND WAKEM WAS TOO ACUTE NOT TO BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF HONESTY HE WAS GIVEN TOO OBSERVING INDIVIDUALS NOT TO JUDGING OF THEM ACCORDING TO MAXIMS
3196-151981-0086 AND NO ONE KNEW BETTER THAN HE THAT ALL MEN WERE NOT LIKE HIMSELF BESIDES HE INTENDED TO OVERLOOK THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF LAND AND MILL PRETTY CLOSELY
3196-151981-0087 BUT THERE WERE GOOD REASONS FOR PURCHASING DORLCOTE MILL QUITE APART FROM ANY BENEVOLENT VENGEANCE ON THE MILLER IT WAS REALLY A CAPITAL INVESTMENT BESIDES GUEST AND CO WERE GOING TO BID FOR IT
3196-151981-0088 AS WELL AS IN HIS TABLE TALK FOR WAKEM WAS NOT A MERE MAN OF BUSINESS HE WAS CONSIDERED A PLEASANT FELLOW IN THE UPPER CIRCLES OF SAINT OGG'S CHATTED AMUSINGLY OVER HIS PORT WINE
3196-151981-0089 THAN MOST MEN WERE TO THEIR BEST SHAPEN OFFSPRING NOT THAT MISTER WAKEM HAD NOT OTHER SONS BESIDE PHILIP
3196-151981-0090 AND PROVIDED FOR THEM IN A GRADE OF LIFE DULY BENEATH HIS OWN IN THIS FACT INDEED THERE LAY THE CLENCHING MOTIVE TO THE PURCHASE OF DORLCOTE MILL
3196-151981-0091 THAT THIS PURCHASE WOULD IN A FEW YEARS TO COME FURNISH A HIGHLY SUITABLE POSITION FOR A CERTAIN FAVORITE LAD WHOM HE MEANT TO BRING ON IN THE WORLD THESE WERE THE MENTAL CONDITIONS ON WHICH MISSUS TULLIVER HAD UNDERTAKEN TO ACT PERSUASIVELY AND HAD FAILED
