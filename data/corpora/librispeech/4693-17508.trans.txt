4693-17508-0000 CHAPTER ELEVEN THE EAGLE SCREAMS DESPITE THE GLORIES OF THE AMALFI ROAD
4693-17508-0001 OUR TOURISTS DECIDED IT WAS MORE PLEASANT TO LOITER AROUND SORRENTO FOR A TIME THAN TO UNDERTAKE FURTHER EXCURSIONS THE MORNINGS AND EVENINGS WERE CHILL
4693-17508-0002 INTO THE BEAUTIFUL GARDENS
4693-17508-0003 THAT SHUT IN THE VILLAS AND ORANGE GROVES SOMETIMES THEY FOUND A GATE OPEN AND WERE WELCOMED TO THE ORCHARDS AND PERMITTED TO PLUCK FREELY THE FRAGRANT AND RICH FLAVORED FRUIT
4693-17508-0004 WHICH IS EXCELLED IN NO OTHER SECTION OF THE SOUTH COUNTRY ALSO UNCLE JOHN WITH BETH AND PATSY FREQUENTED THE SHOPS OF THE WOOD WORKERS
4693-17508-0005 AND WATCHED THEIR DELICATE AND BUSY FINGERS INLAYING THE VARIOUS COLORED WOODS BUT LOUISE MOSTLY KEPT TO THE GARDEN WHERE COUNT FERRALTI BEING A SEMI INVALID WAS CONTENT
4693-17508-0006 TO SIT BY HER SIDE AND AMUSE HER
4693-17508-0007 OF THE FALSE POSITION ASSUMED BY THIS YOUNG MAN LOUISE SEEMED TO LIKE HIS ATTENTIONS AND TO APPROVE HIS EVIDENT ADMIRATION FOR HER HIS WAYS MIGHT BE AFFECTED AND EFFEMINATE
4693-17508-0008 YET IN HIS MATURE EYES THERE WAS NOT MUCH ABOUT FERRALTI TO AROUSE ADMIRATION AND THE LITTLE MAN CONSIDERED HIS GIRLS TOO SENSIBLE TO BE GREATLY IMPRESSED
4693-17508-0009 BY THIS YOUTHFUL ITALIAN'S PERSONALITY SO HE ALLOWED HIM TO SIT WITH HIS NIECES IN THE GARDENS AS MUCH AS HE PLEASED BELIEVING IT WOULD BE UNGRATEFUL TO DEPRIVE THE COUNT
4693-17508-0010 ONE DAY THEY DEVOTED TO CAPRI AND THE BLUE GROTTO AND AFTERWARD THEY LUNCHED AT THE QUISISANA AND PASSED THE AFTERNOON IN THE TOWN BUT THE CHARMS OF SORRENTO
4693-17508-0011 AND THEN CAME A LETTER FROM COLONEL ANGELI TELLING THEM TO RETURN TO NAPLES AND WITNESS THE RESULTS OF THE ERUPTION
4693-17508-0012 THIS THEY DECIDED TO DO AND BIDDING GOOD BYE TO SIGNOR FLORIANO AND HIS EXCELLENT HOTEL THEY STEAMED ACROSS THE BAY AND FOUND
4693-17508-0013 FROM THE DISMAL PLACE THEY HAD LEFT IN THEIR FLIGHT FROM NAPLES IT WAS NOW TEEMING WITH LIFE FOR ALL DANGER BEING PAST THE TOURISTS HAD FLOCKED TO THE CITY IN DROVES
4693-17508-0014 THE TOWN WAS STILL COVERED WITH ASHES BUT UNDER THE BRILLIANT SUNSHINE IT DID NOT LOOK AS GLOOMY AS ONE MIGHT IMAGINE AND ALREADY THOUSANDS OF CARTS WERE BUSILY GATHERING THE DUST FROM THE STREETS
4693-17508-0015 AND DUMPING IT IN THE WATERS OF THE BAY IT WOULD REQUIRE MONTHS OF HARD WORK THOUGH BEFORE NAPLES COULD REGAIN A SEMBLANCE OF ITS FORMER BEAUTY THEIR FRIEND THE COLONEL
4693-17508-0016 PERSONALLY ACCOMPANIED THEM TO THE TOWNS THAT HAD SUFFERED THE MOST FROM THE ERUPTION AT BOSCATRECASA THEY WALKED OVER THE GREAT BEDS OF LAVA THAT HAD DEMOLISHED THE TOWN
4693-17508-0017 BANKS OF CINDERS LOOKING LIKE LUMPS OF PUMICE STONE AND MASSED FROM TWENTY TO THIRTY FEET IN THICKNESS THROUGHOUT THE VALLEY THE LAVA WAS STILL SO HOT THAT IT WAS LIABLE TO BLISTER THE SOLES OF THEIR FEET
4693-17508-0018 IT WOULD BE MANY MORE DAYS BEFORE THE INTERIOR OF THE MASS BECAME COLD THROUGH THE FORLORN DUST COVERED VINEYARDS THEY DROVE TO SAN GUISEPPE WHERE A CHURCH ROOF HAD FALLEN IN
4693-17508-0019 AND KILLED ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY PEOPLE MAIMING MANY MORE THE RED CROSS TENTS WERE PITCHED IN THE STREETS AND THE WHOLE TOWN WAS ONE VAST HOSPITAL OTTAJANO
4693-17508-0020 A LITTLE NEARER TO THE VOLCANO HAD BEEN BURIED IN SCORIA AND NINE TENTHS OF THE ROOFS HAD FALLEN IN RENDERING THE DWELLINGS UNTENABLE
4693-17508-0021 FROM HERE A CLEAR VIEW OF MT VESUVIUS COULD BE OBTAINED
4693-17508-0022 AND THE CONE HAD LOST SIXTY FIVE FEET OF ITS ALTITUDE
4693-17508-0023 THAT LITTERED THE COUNTRY FOR MILES AROUND IT SEEMED TO EQUAL A DOZEN MOUNTAINS THE SIZE OF VESUVIUS THE MARVEL WAS THAT SO MUCH ASHES AND CINDERS COULD COME FROM A SINGLE CRATER
4693-17508-0024 IN SO SHORT A PERIOD NAPLES WAS CLEANING HOUSE BUT SLOWLY AND LISTLESSLY THE PEOPLE SEEMED AS CHEERFUL AND LIGHT HEARTED AS EVER
4693-17508-0025 AND UNCLE JOHN AND HIS NIECES WERE MUCH INTERESTED IN THE BRONZE AND MARBLE STATUARY THAT HERE FORM THE GREATEST SINGLE COLLECTION IN ALL THE WORLD
4693-17508-0026 IT WAS AT THE MUSEUM THAT MISTER MERRICK WAS ARRESTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE AN EXPERIENCE HE NEVER AFTERWARD FORGOT
4693-17508-0027 BAD MONEY IS SO COMMON IN NAPLES THAT UNCLE JOHN NEVER ACCEPTED ANY CHANGE FROM ANYONE BUT OBTAINED ALL HIS SILVER COINS AND NOTES DIRECTLY
4693-17508-0028 A GOVERNMENT INSTITUTION ONE MORNING HE DROVE WITH THE GIRLS TO THE MUSEUM AND PAID THE CABMAN A LIRA BUT BEFORE HE COULD ASCEND THE STEPS THE MAN WAS AFTER HIM AND HOLDING OUT A LEADEN COIN
4693-17508-0029 CLAIMING THAT HIS FARE HAD GIVEN HIM BAD MONEY AND MUST EXCHANGE IT FOR GOOD THIS IS SO COMMON A METHOD OF SWINDLING THAT UNCLE JOHN PAID NO HEED TO THE DEMANDS OF THE CABMAN
4693-17508-0030 IN HIS UNIFORM OF DARK BLUE WITH YELLOW BUTTONS AND CAP
4693-17508-0031 UPON THE AMERICAN'S SHOULDER UNCLE JOHN ANGRILY SHOOK HIM OFF BUT THE MAN PERSISTED AND AN INTERPRETER EMPLOYED BY THE MUSEUM STEPPED FORWARD AND EXPLAINED
4693-17508-0032 THAT UNLESS THE CABMAN WAS GIVEN A GOOD COIN IN EXCHANGE FOR THE BAD ONE
4693-17508-0033 OR MAGISTRATE BUT I GAVE HIM A GOOD COIN A LIRA DIRECT FROM THE BANK DECLARED UNCLE JOHN HE EXHIBITS A BAD ONE RETURNED THE INTERPRETER CALMLY
4693-17508-0034 HE'S A SWINDLER
4693-17508-0035 AND ENTITLED TO A JUST PAYMENT SAID THE OTHER SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS YOU ARE ALL LEAGUED TOGETHER SAID UNCLE JOHN INDIGNANTLY BUT YOU WILL GET NO MORE MONEY OUT OF ME I PROMISE YOU
4693-17508-0036 THE RESULT WAS THAT THE STUBBORN AMERICAN WAS PLACED UNDER ARREST LEAVING THE GIRLS AT THE MUSEUM IN CHARGE OF FERRALTI WHO HAD MADE NO ATTEMPT TO INTERFERE IN THE DISPUTE
4693-17508-0037 BUT IMPLORED UNCLE JOHN TO PAY AND AVOID TROUBLE THE ANGRY PRISONER WAS PLACED IN THE SAME CAB HE HAD ARRIVED IN AND WITH THE OFFICER SEATED BESIDE HIM
4693-17508-0038 WITH BARED BOWED HEADS AND IN LOW TONES PREFERRED THE CHARGE AGAINST THE PRISONER
4693-17508-0039 INTO KINGDOM COME THE MAGISTRATE WAS STARTLED AND ORDERED THE PRISONER SEARCHED FOR CONCEALED WEAPONS
4693-17508-0040 THE CABMAN WAS DISPATCHED FOR SOMEONE WHO COULD SPEAK ENGLISH AND WHEN AN INTERPRETER ARRIVED THE AMERICAN TOLD HIM TO SEND FOR THE UNITED STATES CONSUL
4693-17508-0041 AND ALSO TO INFORM THE MAGISTRATE THAT NOTHING BUT WAR BETWEEN AMERICA AND ITALY COULD WIPE OUT THE AFFRONT THAT HAD BEEN THRUST UPON HIM THE MAGISTRATE WAS DISTURBED
4693-17508-0042 AND PREFERRED NOT TO SEND FOR THE CONSUL HE OFFERED TO RELEASE UNCLE JOHN IF HE WOULD GIVE THE CABMAN A GOOD LIRA IN EXCHANGE FOR THE BAD ONE THE OFFICIAL FEE WOULD BE FIVE LIRA
4693-17508-0043 OR EVEN TWO UNCLE JOHN FLATLY REFUSED TO PAY ANYTHING TO ANYBODY ONLY WAR COULD SETTLE THIS INTERNATIONAL COMPLICATION BLOODY AND BITTER WAR
4693-17508-0044 THE CONSUL MUST CABLE AT ONCE FOR WAR SHIPS AND TROOPS HE WOULD INSIST UPON IT ALL COMPROMISE WAS NOW IMPOSSIBLE
4693-17508-0045 WHO WAS EVIDENTLY A PERSONAGE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AND ABLE TO DECLARE WAR AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE THE CABMAN THE MAGISTRATE THE GUARDE AND THE INTERPRETER PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER
4693-17508-0046 AND CHATTERED VOLUBLE ITALIAN ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE IN EXCITED TONES WHILE UNCLE JOHN CONTINUED TO WARN THEM AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS THAT THEIR COUNTRY WAS DOOMED TO SUDDEN ANNIHILATION
4693-17508-0047 AND THEY WERE THE CULPRITS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMING CALAMITY AS A RESULT THEY BUNDLED THE IRATE AMERICAN INTO THE CARRIAGE AGAIN AND DROVE HIM POSTE HASTE BACK TO THE MUSEUM
4693-17508-0048 WHERE THEY DEPOSITED HIM UPON THE STEPS THEN IN A FLASH
4693-17508-0049 AND WERE SEEN NO MORE THE VICTOR SMILED PROUDLY AS HIS NIECES RUSHED TOWARD HIM DID YOU HAVE TO PAY ANOTHER LIRA UNCLE ASKED PATSY ANXIOUSLY
4693-17508-0050 MOPPING HIS BROW VIGOROUSLY THEY'RE A LOT OF CUTTHROATS AND ASSASSINS POLICEMEN MAGISTRATES AND ALL BUT WHEN THE EAGLE SCREAMS THEY'RE WISE ENOUGH TO DUCK
4693-17508-0051 THE GIRLS LAUGHED AND DID THE EAGLE SCREAM THEN PATSY ENQUIRED JUST A LITTLE MY DEAR BUT IF IT
4693-17508-0052 WHISPERED IT WOULD SOUND MIGHTY LOUD IN THIS MUMMIFIED OLD WORLD
