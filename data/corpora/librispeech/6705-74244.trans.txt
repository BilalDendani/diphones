6705-74244-0000 ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND A SINGLE WORD OF IT THE LONG DELIBERATE LATIN WORDS ROLLED OUT VERY GRAND TO HIS EAR AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH IT IS JUST AS WELL HIS SCHOLARSHIP WAS FAULTY
6705-74244-0001 FOR THIS IS THE ENGLISH OF THOSE SAME WORDS IT IS MY INTENTION TO DIE IN A TAVERN WITH WINE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD CLOSE BY MY THIRSTY MOUTH THAT ANGELS IN CHORUS MAY SING WHEN THEY REACH ME
6705-74244-0002 BUT SO DEVOUTLY DID THE MONKS DWELL UPON THE SYLLABLES SO EARNESTLY WERE THE ARMS OF EACH ONE FOLDED AGAINST HIS BREAST THAT YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE SUSPECTED ANY UNCLERICAL SENTIMENTS WERE BEING EXPRESSED
6705-74244-0003 THE PROXIMITY OF SO MANY PETTICOATS AND KIRTLES CAUSED CONSIDERABLE RESTLESSNESS TO HUBERT BUT HE FELT THE BURNING EYE OF THE GRAND MARSHAL FIXED UPON HIM AND SANG AWAY WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
6705-74244-0004 SIR GODFREY BEGAN TO GROW IMPATIENT HEM HE SAID MOVING HIS FOOT SLIGHTLY
6705-74244-0005 SO THAT THE BARON'S REMARK AND THE NOISE HIS FOOT HAD MADE SOUNDED ALL OVER THE ROOM THIS DISCONCERTED HIM
6705-74244-0006 AND HE ROLLED HIS EYES FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER WATCHING FOR ANY EFFECT HIS DISTURBANCE MIGHT HAVE MADE BUT WITH THE BREEDING OF A TRUE MAN OF THE WORLD THE GRAND MARSHAL MERELY OBSERVED
6705-74244-0007 GOOD MORNING FATHER RETURNED SIR GODFREY AND WHAT WOULD YOU WITH ME PURSUED THE SO CALLED FATHER ANSELM SPEAK MY SON WELL THE FACT IS
6705-74244-0008 THE BARON BEGAN MARCHING FORWARD BUT HE ENCOUNTERED THE EYE OF THE ABBOT WHERE SHONE A COLD SURPRISE AT THIS OVER FAMILIAR FASHION OF SPEECH SO HE CHECKED HIMSELF AND IN AS RESTRAINED A VOICE AS HE COULD COMMAND
6705-74244-0009 TOLD HIS STORY HOW HIS DAUGHTER HAD DETERMINED TO MEET THE DRAGON AND SO SAVE WANTLEY HOW NOTHING THAT A PARENT COULD SAY HAD INFLUENCED HER INTENTIONS IN THE LEAST AND NOW HE PLACED THE ENTIRE MATTER IN THE HANDS OF THE CHURCH
