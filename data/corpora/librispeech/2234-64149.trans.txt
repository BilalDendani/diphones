2234-64149-0000 IMPOSSIBLE TO DEPICT THE EXPRESSION ON VIVIAN RYECROFT'S FACE AS THE WORDS OF THE WATERMAN FALL UPON HIS EAR IT IS MORE THAN SURPRISE MORE THAN ASTONISHMENT INTENSELY INTERROGATIVE
2234-64149-0001 AND ALMOST UPSETTING THE TABLE ALIVE HE MECHANICALLY REPEATS WHAT DO YOU MEAN WINGATE AND WHO MY POOR GIRL CAPTAIN YOU KNOW HIS GIRL NOT MINE MARY MORGAN NOT GWENDOLINE WYNN
2234-64149-0002 CONTROLLING IT THE OTHER ASKS WITH DIMINISHED INTEREST STILL EARNESTLY WHAT LEADS YOU TO THINK THAT WAY WINGATE HAVE YOU A REASON YES HAVE I MORE'N ONE

2234-64149-0011 THE CAPTAIN DOES STAY LISTENING ON TO HEAR THE STORY OF THE PLANTED AND PLUCKED UP FLOWER OF ANOTHER AND LATER VISIT MADE BY WINGATE TO THE CEMETERY IN DAYLIGHT
2234-64149-0012 THEN SEEING WHAT LED HIM TO SUSPECT THAT NOT ONLY HAD THE PLANT BEEN DESTROYED BUT ALL THE TURF ON THE GRAVE DISTURBED HE SPEAKS OF HIS ASTONISHMENT AT THIS WITH HIS PERPLEXITY
2234-64149-0013 THEN GOES ON TO GIVE ACCOUNT OF THE EVENING SPENT WITH JOSEPH PREECE IN HIS NEW HOME OF THE WAIFS AND STRAYS THERE SHOWN HIM THE COUNTERFEIT COINS BURGLARS TOOLS AND FINALLY THE SHROUD
