3645-186230-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN AUNT JANE'S HEIRESS SILAS SAID AUNT JANE TO HER LAWYER THE NEXT MORNING AFTER HER INTERVIEW WITH PATSY I'M READY TO HAVE YOU DRAW UP MY WILL MISTER WATSON GAVE A START OF ASTONISHMENT
3645-186230-0001 IN HIS OWN MIND HE HAD ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT THE WILL WOULD NEVER BE EXECUTED AND TO HAVE MISS MERRICK THUS SUDDENLY DECLARE HER DECISION WAS ENOUGH TO STARTLE EVEN THE LAWYER'S NATURAL RESERVE VERY WELL JANE HE SAID BRIEFLY
3645-186230-0002 THEY WERE ALONE IN THE INVALID'S MORNING ROOM PHIBBS HAVING BEEN ASKED TO RETIRE THERE IS NO USE DISGUISING THE FACT SILAS THAT I GROW WEAKER EVERY DAY AND THE NUMBNESS IS CREEPING NEARER AND NEARER TO MY HEART SAID MISS MERRICK IN HER USUAL EVEN TONES
3645-186230-0003 IT IS FOLLY FOR ME TO TRIFLE WITH THESE FEW DAYS OF GRACE YET ALLOWED ME
3645-186230-0004 YES HE SAID ENQUIRINGLY AND DREW FROM HIS POCKET A PENCIL AND PAPER I SHALL LEAVE TO MY NIECE LOUISE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS YES JANE JOTTING DOWN THE MEMORANDUM AND TO ELIZABETH A LIKE SUM
3645-186230-0005 THE LAWYER SEEMED DISAPPOINTED HE TAPPED THE PENCIL AGAINST HIS TEETH MUSINGLY FOR A MOMENT AND THEN WROTE DOWN THE AMOUNT ALSO TO MY BROTHER JOHN MERRICK THE SUM OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SHE RESUMED TO YOUR BROTHER
3645-186230-0006 JANE DID YOU HEAR ME YES THEN DO AS I BID YOU SILAS WATSON HE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED AT HER THOUGHTFULLY I AM NOT ONLY YOUR LAWYER JANE I AM ALSO YOUR FRIEND AND COUNSELLOR
3645-186230-0007 DO YOU REALIZE WHAT THIS BEQUEST MEANS HE ASKED GENTLY IT MEANS THAT PATRICIA WILL INHERIT ELMHURST AND A FORTUNE BESIDES WHY NOT SILAS I LIKED THE CHILD FROM THE FIRST SHE'S FRANK AND OPEN AND BRAVE
3645-186230-0008 SHE IS VERY YOUNG AND UNSOPHISTICATED SAID THE LAWYER AND OF ALL YOUR NIECES SHE WILL LEAST APPRECIATE YOUR GENEROSITY YOU ARE TO BE MY EXECUTOR AND MANAGE THE ESTATE UNTIL THE GIRL COMES OF AGE YOU WILL SEE THAT SHE IS PROPERLY EDUCATED AND FITTED FOR HER STATION IN LIFE
3645-186230-0009 AS FOR APPRECIATION OR GRATITUDE I DON'T CARE A SNAP OF MY FINGER FOR SUCH FOL DE ROL THE LAWYER SIGHED BUT THE BOY JANE YOU SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN HIM HE SAID DRAT THE BOY I'VE DONE ENOUGH FOR HIM ALREADY
3645-186230-0010 THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY JANE DECLARED THE LAWYER IMPRESSIVELY WE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE IN OUR INVESTMENTS AND YOU HAVE USED BUT LITTLE OF YOUR AMPLE INCOME TO SPARE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO KENNETH WHO IS TOM'S SOLE REMAINING RELATIVE WOULD BE NO HARDSHIP TO PATRICIA
3645-186230-0011 INDEED SHE WOULD SCARCELY MISS IT YOU REMIND ME OF SOMETHING SILAS SHE SAID LOOKING AT HIM WITH FRIENDLY EYES MAKE A MEMORANDUM OF TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO SILAS WATSON
3645-186230-0012 THANK YOU JANE HE WROTE DOWN THE AMOUNT AS CALMLY AS HE HAD DONE THE OTHERS AND THE BOY HE ASKED PERSISTENTLY AUNT JANE SIGHED WEARILY AND LEANED AGAINST HER PILLOWS GIVE THE BOY TWO THOUSAND SHE SAID
3645-186230-0013 I WANT TO SIGN IT TODAY IF POSSIBLE HE BOWED GRAVELY AND LEFT THE ROOM TOWARD EVENING THE LAWYER CAME AGAIN BRINGING WITH HIM A NOTARY FROM THE VILLAGE DOCTOR ELIEL WHO HAD COME TO VISIT PATRICIA WAS ALSO CALLED INTO JANE MERRICK'S ROOM
3645-186230-0014 SAID THE OLD WOMAN WITH A SIGH OF INTENSE RELIEF I CAN DIE IN PEACE
3645-186230-0015 BUT THE BEGINNING OF AN ERA OF UNUSUAL COMFORT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING SHE AWAKENED BRIGHTER THAN USUAL HAVING PASSED A GOOD NIGHT FREED FROM THE WORRIES AND ANXIETIES THAT HAD BESET HER FOR WEEKS SHE FELT MORE LIKE HER OLD SELF THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE PARALYSIS HAD OVERTAKEN HER
3645-186230-0016 AND PASSED THE MORNING MOST ENJOYABLY IN HER SUNSHINEY GARDEN HERE PATRICIA WAS ALSO BROUGHT IN HER WHEEL CHAIR BY BETH WHO THEN LEFT THE TWO INVALIDS TOGETHER THEY CONVERSED GENIALLY ENOUGH FOR A TIME UNTIL AN UNFORTUNATE REMARK OF AUNT JANE'S
3645-186230-0017 WHICH SEEMED TO ASPERSE HER FATHER'S CHARACTER AROUSED PATRICIA'S IRE
3645-186230-0018 AND IN HER VOLUABLE IRISH WAY BERATED HER AUNT UNTIL POOR PHIBBS STOOD AGHAST AT SUCH TEMERITY AND EVEN MISTER WATSON WHO ARRIVED TO ENQUIRE AFTER HIS CLIENT AND FRIEND WAS FILLED WITH AMAZEMENT HE CAST A SIGNIFICANT LOOK AT MISS MERRICK WHO ANSWERED IT IN HER USUAL EMPHATIC WAY
3645-186230-0019 PATRICIA IS QUITE RIGHT SILAS SHE DECLARED AND I DESERVE ALL THAT SHE HAS SAID IF THE GIRL WERE FOND ENOUGH OF ME TO DEFEND ME AS HEARTILY AS SHE DOES HER FATHER I WOULD BE VERY PROUD INDEED PATRICIA COOLED AT ONCE AND REGARDED HER AUNT WITH A SUNNY SMILE
3645-186230-0020 FORGIVE ME SHE BEGGED I KNOW YOU DID NOT MEAN IT AND I WAS WRONG TO TALK TO YOU IN SUCH A WAY SO HARMONY WAS RESTORED AND MISTER WATSON WONDERED MORE AND MORE AT THIS STRANGE PERVERSION OF THE OLD WOMAN'S CHARACTER
3645-186230-0021 BUT NOW SHE SEEMED DELIGHTED TO HAVE PATSY FLY AT HER AND EXCUSED THE GIRL'S TEMPER INSTEAD OF RESENTING IT BUT PATSY WAS A LITTLE ASHAMED OF HERSELF THIS MORNING REALIZING PERHAPS THAT AUNT JANE HAD BEEN TRYING TO VEX HER JUST TO ENJOY HER INDIGNANT SPEECHES
3645-186230-0022 AFTER THAT IT BECAME THE DAILY PROGRAM FOR PATSY TO SPEND HER MORNINGS IN AUNT JANE'S LITTLE GARDEN AND ALTHOUGH THEY SOMETIMES CLASHED AND AS PHIBBS TOLD BETH HAD DREADFUL FIGHTS THEY BOTH ENJOYED THESE HOURS VERY MUCH
3645-186230-0023 AND LOUISE REDOUBLED HER SOLICITIOUS ATTENTIONS TO HER AUNT IN ORDER TO OFFSET THE INFLUENCE PATRICIA SEEMED TO BE GAINING OVER HER LOUISE HAD ALSO BECOME BY THIS TIME THE MANAGING HOUSEKEEPER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
3645-186230-0024 AND IT WAS CERTAIN THAT AUNT JANE LOOKED UPON HER ELDEST AND MOST COMPETENT NIECE WITH MUCH FAVOR BETH WITH ALL HER FRIENDS TO SING HER PRAISES
3645-186230-0025 NOR AS AMUSING AS PATRICIA SO AUNT JANE PAYS LITTLE ATTENTION TO ME SHE'S A DREADFUL OLD WOMAN AND I CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO APPEAR TO LIKE HER THAT PROBABLY ACCOUNTS FOR MY FAILURE
3645-186230-0026 IN A FORTNIGHT MORE PATRICIA ABANDONED HER CHAIR AND TOOK TO CRUTCHES ON WHICH SHE HOBBLED EVERYWHERE AS ACTIVELY AS THE OTHERS WALKED SHE AFFECTED HER COUSINS SOCIETY MORE FROM THIS TIME AND AUNT JANE'S SOCIETY LESS
3645-186230-0027 FOR SHE HAD COME TO BE FOND OF THE TWO GIRLS WHO HAD NURSED HER SO TENDERLY AND IT WAS NATURAL THAT A YOUNG GIRL WOULD PREFER TO BE WITH THOSE OF HER OWN AGE RATHER THAN A CRABBED OLD WOMAN LIKE AUNT JANE KENNETH ALSO NOW BECAME PATSY'S FAITHFUL COMPANION
3645-186230-0028 FOR THE BOY HAD LOST HIS FORMER BASHFULNESS AND FEAR OF GIRLS AND HAD GROWN TO FEEL AT EASE EVEN IN THE SOCIETY OF BETH AND LOUISE THE FOUR HAD MANY EXCURSIONS AND PICNICS INTO THE COUNTRY TOGETHER BUT KENNETH AND PATSY WERE RECOGNIZED AS ESPECIAL CHUMS
3645-186230-0029 IN A GOOD NATURED WAY THE BOY'S OLD ACQUAINTANCES COULD HARDLY RECOGNIZE HIM AS THE SAME PERSON THEY HAD KNOWN BEFORE PATRICIA'S ADVENTURE ON THE PLANK HIS FITS OF GLOOMY ABSTRACTION AND VIOLENT BURSTS OF TEMPER HAD ALIKE VANISHED OR ONLY PREVAILED AT BRIEF INTERVALS
3645-186230-0030 NOR WAS HE LONGER RUDE AND UNMANNERLY TO THOSE WITH WHOM HE CAME IN CONTACT AWKWARD HE STILL WAS AND LACKING IN MANY GRACES THAT EDUCATION AND GOOD SOCIETY CAN ALONE CONFER BUT HE WAS TRYING HARD TO BE AS HE CONFIDED TO OLD UNCLE JOHN LIKE OTHER PEOPLE
3645-186230-0031 AND SUCCEEDED IN ADAPTING HIMSELF VERY WELL TO HIS NEW CIRCUMSTANCES ALTHOUGH HE HAD NO TEACHER AS YET HE HAD BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND COLOR A LITTLE AND SUCCEEDED IN FINISHING ONE OR TWO WATER COLOR SKETCHES WHICH PATSY WHO KNEW NOTHING AT ALL OF SUCH THINGS
3645-186230-0032 PRONOUNCED WONDERFULLY FINE OF COURSE THE BOY BLUSHED WITH PLEASURE AND WAS ENCOURAGED TO STILL GREATER EFFORT THE GIRL WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR KENNETH'S SUDDEN ADVANCEMENT IN THE HOUSEHOLD AT ELMHURST ONE DAY SHE SAID CALMLY TO AUNT JANE I'VE INVITED KENNETH TO DINNER THIS EVENING
3645-186230-0033 THE WOMAN FLEW ANGRY IN AN INSTANT WHO GAVE YOU SUCH AUTHORITY SHE DEMANDED NO ONE I JUST TOOK IT SAID PATSY SAUCILY HE SHALL NOT COME DECLARED AUNT JANE STERNLY I'LL HAVE NO INTERFERENCE FROM YOU MISS
3645-186230-0034 TELL THEM NOT TO LAY A PLATE FOR ME AND ASK OSCAR TO BE READY WITH THE WAGON AT FIVE O'CLOCK I'M GOING HOME LOUISE HESITATED AND LOOKED FROM MISS JANE TO PATSY AND BACK AGAIN THEY WERE GLARING UPON EACH OTHER LIKE TWO GORGONS THEN SHE BURST INTO LAUGHTER
3645-186230-0035 SHE COULD NOT HELP IT THE SIGHT WAS TOO RIDICULOUS A MOMENT LATER PATSY WAS LAUGHING TOO AND THEN AUNT JANE ALLOWED A GRIM SMILE TO CROSS HER FEATURES NEVER MIND LOUISE SHE SAID WITH REMARKABLE CHEERFULNESS WE'LL COMPROMISE MATTERS HOW ASKED PATSY
3645-186230-0036 AND WAS SO GENTLE AND UNOBSTRUSIVE THAT AUNT JANE LOOKED AT HIM WITH SURPRISE
3645-186230-0037 PATSY WAS RADIANT WITH DELIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY AUNT JANE REMARKED CASUALLY THAT SHE DID NOT OBJECT TO THE BOY'S PRESENCE AT DINNER AT ALL AND HE COULD COME WHENEVER HE LIKED THIS ARRANGEMENT GAVE GREAT PLEASURE TO BOTH UNCLE JOHN AND MISTER WATSON
3645-186230-0038 THE LATTER OF WHOM WAS OFTEN PRESENT AT THE STATE DINNER AND BOTH MEN CONGRATULATED PATSY UPON THE DISTINCT VICTORY SHE HAD WON NO MORE WAS SAID ABOUT HER LEAVING ELMHURST THE MAJOR WROTE THAT HE WAS HAVING A SPLENDID TIME WITH THE COLONEL AND BEGGED FOR AN EXTENSION OF HIS VACATION
