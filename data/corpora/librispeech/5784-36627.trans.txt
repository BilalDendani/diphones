5784-36627-0000 CROSS SECTION AND SIDE VIEW OF THE NAUTILUS THEN HE BEGAN HIS DESCRIPTION AS FOLLOWS HERE PROFESSOR ARONNAX ARE THE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF THIS BOAT NOW TRANSPORTING YOU
5784-36627-0001 IT'S A VERY LONG CYLINDER WITH CONICAL ENDS IT NOTICEABLY TAKES THE SHAPE OF A CIGAR A SHAPE ALREADY ADOPTED IN LONDON FOR SEVERAL PROJECTS OF THE SAME KIND
5784-36627-0002 THE LENGTH OF THIS CYLINDER FROM END TO END IS EXACTLY SEVENTY METERS AND ITS MAXIMUM BREADTH OF BEAM IS EIGHT METERS SO IT ISN'T QUITE BUILT ON THE TEN TO ONE RATIO OF YOUR HIGH SPEED STEAMERS
5784-36627-0003 BUT ITS LINES ARE SUFFICIENTLY LONG AND THEIR TAPERING GRADUAL ENOUGH SO THAT THE DISPLACED WATER EASILY SLIPS PAST AND POSES NO OBSTACLE TO THE SHIP'S MOVEMENTS THESE TWO DIMENSIONS ALLOW YOU TO OBTAIN
5784-36627-0004 VIA A SIMPLE CALCULATION THE SURFACE AREA AND VOLUME OF THE NAUTILUS ITS SURFACE AREA TOTALS
5784-36627-0005 POINT FOUR FIVE SQUARE METERS
5784-36627-0006 WHICH IS TANTAMOUNT TO SAYING THAT WHEN IT'S COMPLETELY SUBMERGED
5784-36627-0007 IN DRAWING UP PLANS FOR A SHIP MEANT TO NAVIGATE UNDERWATER I WANTED IT WHEN FLOATING ON THE WAVES TO LIE NINE TENTHS BELOW THE SURFACE AND TO EMERGE ONLY ONE TENTH CONSEQUENTLY
5784-36627-0008 UNDER THESE CONDITIONS IT NEEDED TO DISPLACE ONLY NINE TENTHS OF ITS VOLUME HENCE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX POINT FOUR EIGHT CUBIC METERS IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS TO WEIGH ONLY THAT SAME NUMBER OF METRIC TONS
5784-36627-0009 SO I WAS OBLIGED NOT TO EXCEED THIS WEIGHT WHILE BUILDING IT TO THE AFORESAID DIMENSIONS THE NAUTILUS IS MADE UP OF TWO HULLS ONE INSIDE THE OTHER BETWEEN THEM
5784-36627-0010 JOINING THEM TOGETHER ARE IRON T BARS THAT GIVE THIS SHIP THE UTMOST RIGIDITY IN FACT THANKS TO THIS CELLULAR ARRANGEMENT IT HAS THE RESISTANCE OF A STONE BLOCK AS IF IT WERE COMPLETELY SOLID
5784-36627-0011 THE TWO HULLS ARE MANUFACTURED FROM BOILERPLATE STEEL
5784-36627-0012 THE FIRST HULL HAS A THICKNESS OF NO LESS THAN FIVE CENTIMETERS
5784-36627-0013 MY SECOND HULL THE OUTER COVER INCLUDES A KEEL FIFTY CENTIMETERS HIGH BY TWENTY FIVE WIDE WHICH BY ITSELF WEIGHS SIXTY TWO METRIC TONS THIS HULL THE ENGINE THE BALLAST
5784-36627-0014 THE VARIOUS ACCESSORIES AND ACCOMMODATIONS PLUS THE BULKHEADS AND INTERIOR BRACES
5784-36627-0015 WHICH WHEN ADDED TO THREE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR POINT NINE SIX METRIC TONS
5784-36627-0016 CLEAR CLEAR I REPLIED SO THE CAPTAIN WENT ON WHEN THE NAUTILUS LIES ON THE WAVES UNDER THESE CONDITIONS ONE TENTH OF IT DOES EMERGE ABOVE WATER
5784-36627-0017 AND IF I FILL THEM WITH WATER THE BOAT THEN DISPLACES ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVEN POINT TWO METRIC TONS OR IT WEIGHS THAT MUCH AND IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY SUBMERGED THAT'S WHAT COMES ABOUT PROFESSOR
5784-36627-0018 THESE BALLAST TANKS EXIST WITHIN EASY ACCESS IN THE LOWER REACHES OF THE NAUTILUS
5784-36627-0019 THE BOAT SINKS AND IT'S EXACTLY FLUSH WITH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER FINE CAPTAIN BUT NOW WE COME TO A GENUINE DIFFICULTY YOU'RE ABLE TO LIE FLUSH WITH THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN THAT I UNDERSTAND
5784-36627-0020 BUT LOWER DOWN WHILE DIVING BENEATH THAT SURFACE ISN'T YOUR SUBMERSIBLE GOING TO ENCOUNTER A PRESSURE AND CONSEQUENTLY UNDERGO AN UPWARD THRUST THAT MUST BE ASSESSED AT ONE ATMOSPHERE PER EVERY THIRTY FEET OF WATER HENCE AT ABOUT ONE
5784-36627-0021 KILOGRAM PER EACH SQUARE CENTIMETER PRECISELY SIR THEN UNLESS YOU FILL UP THE WHOLE NAUTILUS I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN FORCE IT DOWN INTO THE HEART OF THESE LIQUID MASSES PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED
5784-36627-0022 STATIC OBJECTS MUSTN'T BE CONFUSED WITH DYNAMIC ONES OR WE'LL BE OPEN TO SERIOUS ERROR COMPARATIVELY LITTLE EFFORT IS SPENT IN REACHING THE OCEAN'S LOWER REGIONS BECAUSE ALL OBJECTS HAVE A TENDENCY TO BECOME SINKERS
5784-36627-0023 FOLLOW MY LOGIC HERE I'M ALL EARS CAPTAIN WHEN I WANTED TO DETERMINE WHAT INCREASE IN WEIGHT THE NAUTILUS NEEDED TO BE GIVEN IN ORDER TO SUBMERGE I HAD ONLY TO TAKE NOTE OF THE
5784-36627-0024 PROPORTIONATE REDUCTION IN VOLUME THAT SALT WATER EXPERIENCES IN DEEPER AND DEEPER STRATA THAT'S OBVIOUS I REPLIED NOW THEN IF WATER ISN'T ABSOLUTELY INCOMPRESSIBLE AT LEAST IT COMPRESSES VERY LITTLE
5784-36627-0025 OR PER EVERY THIRTY FEET OF DEPTH
5784-36627-0026 CONSEQUENTLY I'D HAVE TO INCREASE MY WEIGHT FROM ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVEN POINT TWO METRIC TONS TO ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN SEVEN SO THE ADDED WEIGHT WOULD ONLY BE SIX POINT FIVE SEVEN METRIC TONS
5784-36627-0027 THAT'S ALL THAT'S ALL PROFESSOR ARONNAX AND THE CALCULATION IS EASY TO CHECK NOW THEN I HAVE SUPPLEMENTARY BALLAST TANKS
5784-36627-0028 SO I CAN DESCEND TO CONSIDERABLE DEPTHS WHEN I WANT TO RISE AGAIN AND LIE FLUSH WITH THE SURFACE ALL I HAVE TO DO IS EXPEL THAT WATER AND IF I DESIRE THAT THE NAUTILUS EMERGE ABOVE THE WAVES TO ONE TENTH OF ITS TOTAL CAPACITY
5784-36627-0029 I EMPTY ALL THE BALLAST TANKS COMPLETELY THIS LOGIC BACKED UP BY FIGURES LEFT ME WITHOUT A SINGLE OBJECTION
5784-36627-0030 SINCE YOUR DAILY EXPERIENCE BEARS THEM OUT BUT AT THIS JUNCTURE I HAVE A HUNCH THAT WE'RE STILL LEFT WITH ONE REAL DIFFICULTY WHAT'S THAT SIR WHEN YOU'RE AT A DEPTH OF ONE THOUSAND METERS THE NAUTILUS'S
5784-36627-0031 PLATING BEARS A PRESSURE OF ONE HUNDRED ATMOSPHERES IF AT THIS POINT YOU WANT TO EMPTY THE SUPPLEMENTARY BALLAST TANKS IN ORDER TO LIGHTEN YOUR BOAT AND RISE TO THE SURFACE YOUR PUMPS MUST OVERCOME THAT PRESSURE OF ONE HUNDRED ATMOSPHERES
5784-36627-0032 THIS DEMANDS A STRENGTH THAT ELECTRICITY ALONE CAN GIVE ME CAPTAIN NEMO SAID SWIFTLY SIR I REPEAT THE DYNAMIC POWER OF MY ENGINES IS NEARLY INFINITE
5784-36627-0033 BESIDES I USE MY SUPPLEMENTARY BALLAST TANKS ONLY TO REACH AN AVERAGE DEPTH OF
5784-36627-0034 AND THAT WITH A VIEW TO CONSERVING MY MACHINERY ACCORDINGLY WHEN I HAVE A MIND TO VISIT THE OCEAN DEPTHS TWO OR THREE VERTICAL LEAGUES BENEATH THE SURFACE I USE MANEUVERS THAT ARE MORE TIME CONSUMING BUT NO LESS INFALLIBLE
5784-36627-0035 WHAT ARE THEY CAPTAIN I ASKED HERE I'M NATURALLY LED INTO TELLING YOU HOW THE NAUTILUS IS MANEUVERED I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT IN ORDER TO STEER THIS BOAT TO PORT OR STARBOARD IN SHORT
5784-36627-0036 TO MAKE TURNS ON A HORIZONTAL PLANE I USE AN ORDINARY WIDE BLADED RUDDER THAT'S FASTENED TO THE REAR OF THE STERNPOST AND WORKED BY A WHEEL AND TACKLE
5784-36627-0037 BUT I CAN ALSO MOVE THE NAUTILUS UPWARD AND DOWNWARD ON A VERTICAL PLANE BY THE SIMPLE METHOD OF SLANTING ITS TWO FINS WHICH ARE ATTACHED TO ITS SIDES AT ITS CENTER OF FLOTATION THESE FINS ARE FLEXIBLE ABLE TO ASSUME ANY POSITION
5784-36627-0038 IF THESE FINS STAY PARALLEL WITH THE BOAT THE LATTER MOVES HORIZONTALLY IF THEY SLANT THE NAUTILUS FOLLOWS THE ANGLE OF THAT SLANT AND UNDER ITS PROPELLER'S THRUST EITHER SINKS ON A DIAGONAL AS STEEP AS IT SUITS ME
5784-36627-0039 I THROW THE PROPELLER IN GEAR AND THE WATER'S PRESSURE MAKES THE NAUTILUS RISE VERTICALLY AS AN AIR BALLOON INFLATED WITH HYDROGEN LIFTS SWIFTLY INTO THE SKIES BRAVO CAPTAIN I EXCLAIMED
5784-36627-0040 BUT IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS HOW CAN YOUR HELMSMAN FOLLOW THE COURSE YOU'VE GIVEN HIM MY HELMSMAN IS STATIONED BEHIND THE WINDOWS OF A PILOTHOUSE WHICH PROTRUDES FROM THE TOPSIDE OF THE NAUTILUS'S HULL AND IS FITTED WITH
5784-36627-0041 BICONVEX GLASS IS GLASS CAPABLE OF RESISTING SUCH PRESSURES PERFECTLY CAPABLE THOUGH FRAGILE ON IMPACT CRYSTAL CAN STILL OFFER CONSIDERABLE RESISTANCE
5784-36627-0042 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR DURING EXPERIMENTS ON FISHING BY ELECTRIC LIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NORTH SEA GLASS PANES LESS THAN SEVEN MILLIMETERS THICK
5784-36627-0043 ALL THE WHILE LETTING THROUGH STRONG HEAT GENERATING RAYS WHOSE WARMTH
5784-36627-0044 NOW THEN I USE GLASS WINDOWS MEASURING NO LESS THAN TWENTY ONE CENTIMETERS AT THEIR CENTERS IN OTHER WORDS THEY'VE THIRTY TIMES THE THICKNESS FAIR ENOUGH CAPTAIN
5784-36627-0045 OH BRAVO BRAVO THREE TIMES OVER CAPTAIN THAT EXPLAINS THE PHOSPHORESCENT GLOW FROM THIS SO CALLED NARWHALE THAT SO PUZZLED US SCIENTISTS PERTINENT TO THIS
5784-36627-0046 I'LL ASK YOU IF THE NAUTILUS'S RUNNING AFOUL OF THE SCOTIA WHICH CAUSED SUCH A GREAT UPROAR WAS THE RESULT OF AN ACCIDENTAL ENCOUNTER ENTIRELY ACCIDENTAL SIR
5784-36627-0047 WHEN THE COLLISION OCCURRED HOWEVER I COULD SEE THAT IT HAD NO DIRE CONSEQUENCES NONE SIR BUT AS FOR YOUR ENCOUNTER WITH THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN PROFESSOR THAT TROUBLED ME
5784-36627-0048 BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE BEST SHIPS IN THE GALLANT AMERICAN NAVY BUT THEY ATTACKED ME AND I HAD TO DEFEND MYSELF ALL THE SAME I WAS CONTENT SIMPLY TO PUT THE FRIGATE IN A CONDITION WHERE IT COULD DO ME NO HARM
5784-36627-0049 YES PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED WITH GENUINE EXCITEMENT AND I LOVE IT AS IF IT WERE MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD ABOARD A CONVENTIONAL SHIP FACING THE OCEAN'S PERILS DANGER LURKS EVERYWHERE ON THE SURFACE OF THE SEA
5784-36627-0050 YOUR CHIEF SENSATION IS THE CONSTANT FEELING OF AN UNDERLYING CHASM AS THE DUTCHMAN JANSEN SO APTLY PUT IT BUT BELOW THE WAVES ABOARD THE NAUTILUS YOUR HEART NEVER FAILS YOU
5784-36627-0051 NO RIGGING TO BE WORN OUT BY ROLLING AND PITCHING ON THE WAVES NO SAILS FOR THE WIND TO CARRY OFF NO BOILERS FOR STEAM TO BURST OPEN NO FIRES TO FEAR BECAUSE THIS SUBMERSIBLE IS MADE OF SHEET IRON NOT WOOD
5784-36627-0052 NO COAL TO RUN OUT OF SINCE ELECTRICITY IS ITS MECHANICAL FORCE NO COLLISIONS TO FEAR BECAUSE IT NAVIGATES THE WATERY DEEP ALL BY ITSELF NO STORMS TO BRAVE BECAUSE JUST A FEW METERS BENEATH THE WAVES IT FINDS ABSOLUTE TRANQUILITY
5784-36627-0053 THERE SIR THERE'S THE IDEAL SHIP AND IF IT'S TRUE THAT THE ENGINEER HAS MORE CONFIDENCE IN A CRAFT THAN THE BUILDER AND THE BUILDER MORE THAN THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF
5784-36627-0054 YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE UTTER ABANDON WITH WHICH I PLACE MY TRUST IN THIS NAUTILUS SINCE I'M ITS CAPTAIN BUILDER AND ENGINEER ALL IN ONE CAPTAIN NEMO SPOKE WITH WINNING ELOQUENCE
5784-36627-0055 THE FIRE IN HIS EYES AND THE PASSION IN HIS GESTURES TRANSFIGURED HIM YES HE LOVED HIS SHIP THE SAME WAY A FATHER LOVES HIS CHILD BUT ONE QUESTION PERHAPS INDISCREET NATURALLY POPPED UP
5784-36627-0056 AND I COULDN'T RESIST ASKING IT YOU'RE AN ENGINEER THEN CAPTAIN NEMO YES PROFESSOR HE ANSWERED ME I STUDIED IN LONDON PARIS AND NEW YORK BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN I WAS A RESIDENT OF THE EARTH'S CONTINENTS
5784-36627-0057 BUT HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO BUILD THIS WONDERFUL NAUTILUS IN SECRET EACH PART OF IT PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAME FROM A DIFFERENT SPOT ON THE GLOBE AND REACHED ME AT A COVER ADDRESS ITS KEEL WAS FORGED BY CREUSOT
5784-36627-0058 IN FRANCE ITS PROPELLER SHAFT BY PEN AND CO IN LONDON THE SHEET IRON PLATES FOR ITS HULL BY LAIRD'S IN LIVERPOOL ITS PROPELLER BY SCOTT'S IN GLASGOW ITS TANKS WERE MANUFACTURED BY CAIL AND CO IN PARIS
5784-36627-0059 ITS ENGINE BY KRUPP IN PRUSSIA ITS SPUR BY THE MOTALA WORKSHOPS IN SWEDEN ITS PRECISION INSTRUMENTS BY HART BROTHERS IN NEW YORK ET CETERA AND EACH OF THESE SUPPLIERS RECEIVED MY SPECIFICATIONS UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME
5784-36627-0060 BUT I WENT ON ONCE THESE PARTS WERE MANUFACTURED DIDN'T THEY HAVE TO BE MOUNTED AND ADJUSTED PROFESSOR I SET UP MY WORKSHOPS ON A DESERTED ISLET IN MIDOCEAN
5784-36627-0061 THERE OUR NAUTILUS WAS COMPLETED BY ME AND MY WORKMEN IN OTHER WORDS BY MY GALLANT COMPANIONS WHOM I'VE MOLDED AND EDUCATED THEN WHEN THE OPERATION WAS OVER WE BURNED EVERY TRACE OF OUR STAY ON THAT ISLET WHICH IF I COULD HAVE
5784-36627-0062 I'D HAVE BLOWN UP FROM ALL THIS MAY I ASSUME THAT SUCH A BOAT COSTS A FORTUNE AN IRON SHIP PROFESSOR ARONNAX RUNS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE FRANCS PER METRIC TON NOW THEN
5784-36627-0063 CONSEQUENTLY IT COST ONE MILLION SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND FRANCS HENCE TWO MILLION FRANCS INCLUDING ITS ACCOMMODATIONS
5784-36627-0064 ONE LAST QUESTION CAPTAIN NEMO ASK PROFESSOR YOU'RE RICH THEN INFINITELY RICH SIR AND WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE I COULD PAY OFF THE TEN BILLION FRANC FRENCH NATIONAL DEBT
