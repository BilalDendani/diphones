8576-285176-0000 KIND SOLACE IN A DYING HOUR SUCH FATHER IS NOT NOW MY THEME I WILL NOT MADLY DEEM THAT POWER OF EARTH MAY SHRIVE ME OF THE SIN UNEARTHLY PRIDE HATH REVELL'D IN
8576-285176-0001 I HAVE NO TIME TO DOTE OR DREAM YOU CALL IT HOPE THAT FIRE OF FIRE IT IS BUT AGONY OF DESIRE IF I CAN HOPE OH GOD I CAN ITS FOUNT IS HOLIER MORE DIVINE
8576-285176-0002 I WOULD NOT CALL THEE FOOL OLD MAN BUT SUCH IS NOT A GIFT OF THINE KNOW THOU THE SECRET OF A SPIRIT BOW'D FROM ITS WILD PRIDE INTO SHAME O
8576-285176-0003 THE SEARING GLORY WHICH HATH SHONE AMID THE JEWELS OF MY THRONE HALO OF HELL AND WITH A PAIN NOT HELL SHALL MAKE ME FEAR AGAIN O CRAVING HEART FOR THE LOST FLOWERS AND SUNSHINE OF MY SUMMER HOURS
8576-285176-0004 UPON THY EMPTINESS A KNELL I HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN AS NOW THE FEVER'D DIADEM ON MY BROW I CLAIM'D AND WON USURPINGLY
8576-285176-0005 WHICH HATH STRIVEN TRIUMPHANTLY WITH HUMAN KIND ON MOUNTAIN SOIL I FIRST DREW LIFE
8576-285176-0006 AND I BELIEVE THE WINGED STRIFE AND TUMULT OF THE HEADLONG AIR HAVE NESTLED IN MY VERY HAIR SO LATE FROM HEAVEN THAT DEW IT FELL MID DREAMS OF AN UNHOLY NIGHT UPON ME WITH THE TOUCH OF HELL
8576-285176-0007 APPEARED TO MY HALF CLOSING EYE THE PAGEANTRY OF MONARCHY AND THE DEEP TRUMPET THUNDER'S ROAR CAME HURRIEDLY UPON ME TELLING OF HUMAN BATTLE WHERE MY VOICE MY OWN VOICE SILLY CHILD WAS SWELLING
8576-285176-0008 THE BATTLE CRY OF VICTORY THE RAIN CAME DOWN UPON MY HEAD UNSHELTER'D AND THE HEAVY WIND WAS GIANTLIKE SO THOU MY MIND IT WAS BUT MAN I THOUGHT WHO SHED LAURELS UPON ME AND THE RUSH
8576-285176-0009 THE TORRENT OF THE CHILLY AIR GURGLED WITHIN MY EAR THE CRUSH OF EMPIRES WITH THE CAPTIVE'S PRAYER THE HUM OF SUITERS AND THE TONE OF FLATTERY ROUND A SOVEREIGN'S THRONE
8576-285176-0010 MY PASSIONS FROM THAT HAPLESS HOUR USURP'D A TYRANNY WHICH MEN HAVE DEEM'D SINCE I HAVE REACH'D TO POWER MY INNATE NATURE BE IT SO BUT FATHER THERE LIV'D ONE WHO THEN
8576-285176-0011 THEN IN MY BOYHOOD WHEN THEIR FIRE BURN'D WITH A STILL INTENSER GLOW FOR PASSION MUST WITH YOUTH EXPIRE E'EN THEN WHO KNEW THIS IRON HEART IN WOMAN'S WEAKNESS HAD A PART
8576-285176-0012 I HAVE NO WORDS ALAS TO TELL THE LOVELINESS OF LOVING WELL NOR WOULD I NOW ATTEMPT TO TRACE THE MORE THAN BEAUTY OF A FACE WHOSE LINEAMENTS UPON MY MIND ARE SHADOWS
8576-285176-0013 WITH THEIR MEANING MELT TO FANTASIES WITH NONE O SHE WAS WORTHY OF ALL LOVE LOVE AS IN INFANCY WAS MINE TWAS SUCH AS ANGEL MINDS ABOVE MIGHT ENVY
8576-285176-0014 HER YOUNG HEART THE SHRINE ON WHICH MY EV'RY HOPE AND THOUGHT WERE INCENSE THEN A GOODLY GIFT FOR THEY WERE CHILDISH AND UPRIGHT PURE AS HER YOUNG EXAMPLE TAUGHT WHY DID I LEAVE IT AND ADRIFT
8576-285176-0015 TRUST TO THE FIRE WITHIN FOR LIGHT WE GREW IN AGE AND LOVE TOGETHER ROAMING THE FOREST AND THE WILD MY BREAST HER SHIELD IN WINTRY WEATHER
8576-285176-0016 SHE WOULD MARK THE OPENING SKIES I SAW NO HEAVEN BUT IN HER EYES YOUNG LOVE'S FIRST LESSON IS THE HEART FOR MID THAT SUNSHINE AND THOSE SMILES WHEN FROM OUR LITTLE CARES APART
8576-285176-0017 AND LAUGHING AT HER GIRLISH WILES I'D THROW ME ON HER THROBBING BREAST AND POUR MY SPIRIT OUT IN TEARS THERE WAS NO NEED TO SPEAK THE REST NO NEED TO QUIET ANY FEARS OF HER WHO ASK'D NO REASON WHY
8576-285176-0018 BUT TURN'D ON ME HER QUIET EYE YET MORE THAN WORTHY OF THE LOVE MY SPIRIT STRUGGLED WITH AND STROVE WHEN ON THE MOUNTAIN PEAK ALONE AMBITION LENT IT A NEW TONE I HAD NO BEING BUT IN THEE
8576-285176-0019 THE WORLD AND ALL IT DID CONTAIN IN THE EARTH THE AIR THE SEA ITS JOY ITS LITTLE LOT OF PAIN THAT WAS NEW PLEASURE THE IDEAL DIM VANITIES OF DREAMS BY NIGHT AND DIMMER NOTHINGS WHICH WERE REAL
8576-285176-0020 SHADOWS AND A MORE SHADOWY LIGHT PARTED UPON THEIR MISTY WINGS AND SO CONFUSEDLY BECAME THINE IMAGE AND A NAME A NAME TWO SEPARATE YET MOST INTIMATE THINGS
8576-285176-0021 I WAS AMBITIOUS HAVE YOU KNOWN THE PASSION FATHER YOU HAVE NOT
8576-285176-0022 AND MURMUR'D AT SUCH LOWLY LOT BUT JUST LIKE ANY OTHER DREAM UPON THE VAPOUR OF THE DEW MY OWN HAD PAST
8576-285176-0023 THE HOUR THE DAY OPPRESS MY MIND WITH DOUBLE LOVELINESS
8576-285176-0024 ON THE HILLS THE DWINDLED HILLS BEGIRT WITH BOWERS AND SHOUTING WITH A THOUSAND RILLS I SPOKE TO HER OF POWER AND PRIDE BUT MYSTICALLY
8576-285176-0025 IN SUCH GUISE THAT SHE MIGHT DEEM IT NOUGHT BESIDE THE MOMENT'S CONVERSE IN HER EYES I READ PERHAPS TOO CARELESSLY A MINGLED FEELING WITH MY OWN THE FLUSH ON HER BRIGHT CHEEK
8576-285176-0026 TO ME SEEM'D TO BECOME A QUEENLY THRONE TOO WELL THAT I SHOULD LET IT BE LIGHT IN THE WILDERNESS ALONE I WRAPP'D MYSELF IN GRANDEUR THEN AND DONN'D A VISIONARY CROWN YET IT WAS NOT THAT FANTASY HAD THROWN HER MANTLE OVER ME
8576-285176-0027 BUT THAT AMONG THE RABBLE MEN LION AMBITION IS CHAIN'D DOWN AND CROUCHES TO A KEEPER'S HAND NOT SO IN DESERTS WHERE THE GRAND THE WILD
8576-285176-0028 THE TERRIBLE CONSPIRE WITH THEIR OWN BREATH TO FAN HIS FIRE LOOK ROUND THEE NOW ON SAMARCAND IS NOT SHE QUEEN OF EARTH HER PRIDE ABOVE ALL CITIES IN HER HAND THEIR DESTINIES
8576-285176-0029 IN ALL BESIDE OF GLORY WHICH THE WORLD HATH KNOWN STANDS SHE NOT NOBLY AND ALONE FALLING HER VERIEST STEPPING STONE SHALL FORM THE PEDESTAL OF A THRONE AND WHO HER SOVEREIGN TIMOUR
8576-285176-0030 A DIADEM'D OUTLAW O HUMAN LOVE THOU SPIRIT GIVEN ON EARTH OF ALL WE HOPE IN HEAVEN WHICH FALL'ST INTO THE SOUL LIKE RAIN UPON THE SIROC WITHER'D PLAIN
8576-285176-0031 FAREWELL FOR I HAVE WON THE EARTH WHEN HOPE THE EAGLE THAT TOWER'D COULD SEE NO CLIFF BEYOND HIM IN THE SKY HIS PINIONS WERE BENT DROOPINGLY AND HOMEWARD TURN'D HIS SOFTEN'D EYE TWAS SUNSET
8576-285176-0032 WHEN THE SUN WILL PART THERE COMES A SULLENNESS OF HEART TO HIM WHO STILL WOULD LOOK UPON THE GLORY OF THE SUMMER SUN THAT SOUL WILL HATE THE EV'NING MIST SO OFTEN LOVELY
8576-285176-0033 AND WILL LIST TO THE SOUND OF THE COMING DARKNESS KNOWN TO THOSE WHOSE SPIRITS HEARKEN AS ONE WHO IN A DREAM OF NIGHT WOULD FLY BUT CANNOT FROM A DANGER NIGH
8576-285176-0034 WHAT THO THE MOON THE WHITE MOON SHED ALL THE SPLENDOUR OF HER NOON HER SMILE IS CHILLY AND HER BEAM IN THAT TIME OF DREARINESS WILL SEEM SO LIKE YOU GATHER IN YOUR BREATH A PORTRAIT TAKEN AFTER DEATH
8576-285176-0035 AND BOYHOOD IS A SUMMER SUN WHOSE WANING IS THE DREARIEST ONE FOR ALL WE LIVE TO KNOW IS KNOWN AND ALL WE SEEK TO KEEP HATH FLOWN
8576-285176-0036 LET LIFE THEN AS THE DAY FLOWER FALL WITH THE NOON DAY BEAUTY WHICH IS ALL I REACH'D MY HOME MY HOME NO MORE FOR ALL HAD FLOWN WHO MADE IT SO
8576-285176-0037 AND THO MY TREAD WAS SOFT AND LOW A VOICE CAME FROM THE THRESHOLD STONE OF ONE WHOM I HAD EARLIER KNOWN O I DEFY THEE HELL TO SHOW ON BEDS OF FIRE THAT BURN BELOW A HUMBLER HEART
8576-285176-0038 A DEEPER WO FATHER I FIRMLY DO BELIEVE I KNOW FOR DEATH WHO COMES FOR ME FROM REGIONS OF THE BLEST AFAR WHERE THERE IS NOTHING TO DECEIVE HATH LEFT HIS IRON GATE AJAR
8576-285176-0039 AND RAYS OF TRUTH YOU CANNOT SEE ARE FLASHING THRO ETERNITY I DO BELIEVE THAT EBLIS HATH A SNARE IN EV'RY HUMAN PATH ELSE HOW WHEN IN THE HOLY GROVE I WANDERED OF THE IDOL LOVE
8576-285176-0040 WHO DAILY SCENTS HIS SNOWY WINGS WITH INCENSE OF BURNT OFFERINGS FROM THE MOST UNPOLLUTED THINGS WHOSE PLEASANT BOWERS ARE YET SO RIVEN ABOVE WITH TRELLICED RAYS FROM HEAVEN NO MOTE MAY SHUN
8576-285176-0041 NO TINIEST FLY THE LIGHT'NING OF HIS EAGLE EYE HOW WAS IT THAT AMBITION CREPT UNSEEN AMID THE REVELS THERE TILL GROWING BOLD HE LAUGHED AND LEAPT IN THE TANGLES OF LOVE'S VERY HAIR
