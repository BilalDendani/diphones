5810-8674-0000 THE STRONG PRINCE ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A KING WHO WAS SO FOND OF WINE THAT HE COULD NOT GO TO SLEEP UNLESS HE KNEW HE HAD A GREAT FLASKFUL TIED TO HIS BED POST
5810-8674-0001 ALL DAY LONG HE DRANK TILL HE WAS TOO STUPID TO ATTEND TO HIS BUSINESS AND EVERYTHING IN THE KINGDOM WENT TO RACK AND RUIN BUT ONE DAY AN ACCIDENT HAPPENED TO HIM
5810-8674-0002 AND HE WAS STRUCK ON THE HEAD BY A FALLING BOUGH SO THAT HE FELL FROM HIS HORSE AND LAY DEAD UPON THE GROUND HIS WIFE AND SON MOURNED HIS LOSS BITTERLY FOR IN SPITE OF HIS FAULTS HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN KIND TO THEM
5810-8674-0003 SO THEY ABANDONED THE CROWN AND FORSOOK THEIR COUNTRY NOT KNOWING OR CARING WHERE THEY WENT AT LENGTH THEY WANDERED INTO A FOREST AND BEING VERY TIRED SAT DOWN UNDER A TREE TO EAT SOME BREAD THAT THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM
5810-8674-0004 WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED THE QUEEN SAID MY SON I AM THIRSTY FETCH ME SOME WATER THE PRINCE GOT UP AT ONCE AND WENT TO A BROOK WHICH HE HEARD GURGLING NEAR AT HAND HE STOOPED AND FILLED HIS HAT WITH THE WATER WHICH HE BROUGHT TO HIS MOTHER
5810-8674-0005 THEN HE TURNED AND FOLLOWED THE STREAM UP TO ITS SOURCE IN A ROCK WHERE IT BUBBLED OUT CLEAR AND FRESH AND COLD HE KNELT DOWN TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE DEEP POOL BELOW THE ROCK WHEN HE SAW THE REFLECTION OF A SWORD HANGING FROM THE BRANCH OF A TREE OVER HIS HEAD
5810-8674-0006 THE YOUNG MAN DREW BACK WITH A START BUT IN A MOMENT HE CLIMBED THE TREE CUTTING THE ROPE WHICH HELD THE SWORD AND CARRIED THE WEAPON TO HIS MOTHER THE QUEEN WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AT THE SIGHT OF ANYTHING SO SPLENDID IN SUCH A LONELY PLACE
5810-8674-0007 AND TOOK IT IN HER HANDS TO EXAMINE IT CLOSELY IT WAS OF CURIOUS WORKMANSHIP WROUGHT WITH GOLD AND ON ITS HANDLE WAS WRITTEN THE MAN WHO CAN BUCKLE ON THIS SWORD WILL BECOME STRONGER THAN OTHER MEN
5810-8674-0008 THE QUEEN'S HEART SWELLED WITH JOY AS SHE READ THESE WORDS AND SHE BADE HER SON LOSE NO TIME IN TESTING THEIR TRUTH SO HE FASTENED IT ROUND HIS WAIST
5810-8674-0009 HE TOOK HOLD OF A THICK OAK TREE AND ROOTED IT UP AS EASILY AS IF IT HAD BEEN A WEED THIS DISCOVERY PUT NEW LIFE INTO THE QUEEN AND HER SON AND THEY CONTINUED THEIR WALK THROUGH THE FOREST
5810-8674-0010 BUT NIGHT WAS DRAWING ON AND THE DARKNESS GREW SO THICK THAT IT SEEMED AS IF IT COULD BE CUT WITH A KNIFE THEY DID NOT WANT TO SLEEP IN THE WOOD FOR THEY WERE AFRAID OF WOLVES AND OTHER WILD BEASTS SO THEY GROPED THEIR WAY ALONG
5810-8674-0011 HAND IN HAND TILL THE PRINCE TRIPPED OVER SOMETHING WHICH LAY ACROSS THE PATH HE COULD NOT SEE WHAT IT WAS BUT STOOPED DOWN AND TRIED TO LIFT IT THE THING WAS VERY HEAVY AND HE THOUGHT HIS BACK WOULD BREAK UNDER THE STRAIN
5810-8674-0012 AT LAST WITH A GREAT HEAVE HE MOVED IT OUT OF THE ROAD AND AS IT FELL HE KNEW IT WAS A HUGE ROCK BEHIND THE ROCK WAS A CAVE WHICH IT WAS QUITE CLEAR WAS THE HOME OF SOME ROBBERS THOUGH NOT ONE OF THE BAND WAS THERE
5810-8674-0013 HASTILY PUTTING OUT THE FIRE WHICH BURNED BRIGHTLY AT THE BACK AND BIDDING HIS MOTHER COME IN AND KEEP VERY STILL THE PRINCE BEGAN TO PACE UP AND DOWN LISTENING FOR THE RETURN OF THE ROBBERS BUT HE WAS VERY SLEEPY
5810-8674-0014 AND IN SPITE OF ALL HIS EFFORTS HE FELT HE COULD NOT KEEP AWAKE MUCH LONGER WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF THE ROBBERS RETURNING SHOUTING AND SINGING AS THEY MARCHED ALONG SOON THE SINGING CEASED
5810-8674-0015 AND STRAINING HIS EARS HE HEARD THEM DISCUSSING ANXIOUSLY WHAT HAD BECOME OF THEIR CAVE AND WHY THEY COULD NOT SEE THE FIRE AS USUAL THIS MUST BE THE PLACE SAID A VOICE WHICH THE PRINCE TOOK TO BE THAT OF THE CAPTAIN
5810-8674-0016 YES I FEEL THE DITCH BEFORE THE ENTRANCE SOMEONE FORGOT TO PILE UP THE FIRE BEFORE WE LEFT AND IT HAS BURNT ITSELF OUT BUT IT IS ALL RIGHT LET EVERY MAN JUMP ACROSS AND AS HE DOES SO CRY OUT HOP I AM HERE
5810-8674-0017 I WILL GO LAST NOW BEGIN THE MAN WHO STOOD NEAREST JUMPED ACROSS BUT HE HAD NO TIME TO GIVE THE CALL WHICH THE CAPTAIN HAD ORDERED FOR WITH ONE SWIFT SILENT STROKE OF THE PRINCE'S SWORD HIS HEAD
5810-8674-0018 ROLLED INTO A CORNER THEN THE YOUNG MAN CRIED INSTEAD HOP I AM HERE THE SECOND MAN HEARING THE SIGNAL LEAPT THE DITCH IN CONFIDENCE AND WAS MET BY THE SAME FATE
5810-8674-0019 AND IN A FEW MINUTES ELEVEN OF THE ROBBERS LAY DEAD AND THERE REMAINED ONLY THE CAPTAIN NOW THE CAPTAIN HAD WOUND ROUND HIS NECK THE SHAWL OF HIS LOST WIFE AND THE STROKE OF THE PRINCE'S SWORD FELL HARMLESS
5810-8674-0020 BEING VERY CUNNING HOWEVER HE MADE NO RESISTANCE AND ROLLED OVER AS IF HE WERE AS DEAD AS THE OTHER MEN STILL THE PRINCE WAS NO FOOL AND WONDERED IF INDEED HE WAS AS DEAD AS HE SEEMED TO BE
5810-8674-0021 BUT THE CAPTAIN LAY SO STIFF AND STARK THAT AT LAST HE WAS TAKEN IN THE PRINCE NEXT DRAGGED THE HEADLESS BODIES INTO A CHAMBER IN THE CAVE AND LOCKED THE DOOR THEN HE AND HIS MOTHER RANSACKED THE PLACE FOR SOME FOOD
5810-8674-0022 AND WHEN THEY HAD EATEN IT THEY LAY DOWN AND SLEPT IN PEACE WITH THE DAWN THEY WERE BOTH AWAKE AGAIN AND FOUND THAT INSTEAD OF THE CAVE WHICH THEY HAD COME TO THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY NOW WERE IN A SPLENDID CASTLE FULL OF BEAUTIFUL ROOMS
5810-8674-0023 THE PRINCE WENT ROUND ALL THESE AND CAREFULLY LOCKED THEM UP BIDDING HIS MOTHER TAKE CARE OF THE KEYS WHILE HE WAS HUNTING UNFORTUNATELY THE QUEEN LIKE ALL WOMEN COULD NOT BEAR TO THINK THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING WHICH SHE DID NOT KNOW
5810-8674-0024 SO THE MOMENT THAT HER SON HAD TURNED HIS BACK SHE OPENED THE DOORS OF ALL THE ROOMS AND PEEPED IN TILL SHE CAME TO THE ONE WHERE THE ROBBERS LAY BUT IF THE SIGHT OF THE BLOOD ON THE GROUND TURNED HER FAINT
5810-8674-0025 THE SIGHT OF THE ROBBER CAPTAIN WALKING UP AND DOWN WAS A GREATER SHOCK STILL SHE QUICKLY TURNED THE KEY IN THE LOCK AND RAN BACK TO THE CHAMBER SHE HAD SLEPT IN SOON AFTER HER SON CAME IN
5810-8674-0026 BRINGING WITH HIM A LARGE BEAR WHICH HE HAD KILLED FOR SUPPER AS THERE WAS ENOUGH FOOD TO LAST THEM FOR MANY DAYS THE PRINCE DID NOT HUNT THE NEXT MORNING BUT INSTEAD BEGAN TO EXPLORE THE CASTLE
5810-8674-0027 HE FOUND THAT A SECRET WAY LED FROM IT INTO THE FOREST AND FOLLOWING THE PATH HE REACHED ANOTHER CASTLE LARGER AND MORE SPLENDID THAN THE ONE BELONGING TO THE ROBBERS HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR WITH HIS FIST AND SAID THAT HE WANTED TO ENTER
5810-8674-0028 BUT THE GIANT TO WHOM THE CASTLE BELONGED ONLY ANSWERED I KNOW WHO YOU ARE I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ROBBERS I AM NO ROBBER ANSWERED THE PRINCE I AM THE SON OF A KING
5810-8674-0029 THEN HE JUST PUT HIS SHOULDER TO IT AND IMMEDIATELY THE WOOD BEGAN TO CRACK WHEN THE GIANT FOUND THAT IT WAS NO USE KEEPING IT SHUT HE OPENED IT SAYING I SEE YOU ARE A BRAVE YOUTH LET THERE BE PEACE BETWEEN US
5810-8674-0030 AND THE PRINCE WAS GLAD TO MAKE PEACE FOR HE HAD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE GIANT'S BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER AND FROM THAT DAY HE OFTEN SOUGHT THE GIANT'S HOUSE
5810-8674-0031 NOW THE QUEEN LED A DULL LIFE ALL ALONE IN THE CASTLE AND TO AMUSE HERSELF SHE PAID VISITS TO THE ROBBER CAPTAIN WHO FLATTERED HER TILL AT LAST SHE AGREED TO MARRY HIM BUT AS SHE WAS MUCH AFRAID OF HER SON
5810-8674-0032 SHE TOLD THE ROBBER THAT THE NEXT TIME THE PRINCE WENT TO BATHE IN THE RIVER HE WAS TO STEAL THE SWORD FROM ITS PLACE ABOVE THE BED FOR WITHOUT IT THE YOUNG MAN WOULD HAVE NO POWER TO PUNISH HIM FOR HIS BOLDNESS
5810-8674-0033 AND THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE YOUNG MAN WENT TO BATHE HE UNHOOKED THE SWORD FROM ITS NAIL AND BUCKLED IT ROUND HIS WAIST ON HIS RETURN TO THE CASTLE
5810-8674-0034 FOUND THE ROBBER WAITING FOR HIM ON THE STEPS WAVING THE SWORD ABOVE HIS HEAD AND KNOWING THAT SOME HORRIBLE FATE WAS IN STORE FELL ON HIS KNEES AND BEGGED FOR MERCY BUT HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE TRIED TO SQUEEZE BLOOD OUT OF A STONE
5810-8674-0035 THE ROBBER INDEED GRANTED HIM HIS LIFE BUT TOOK OUT BOTH HIS EYES WHICH HE THRUST INTO THE PRINCE'S HAND SAYING BRUTALLY HERE YOU HAD BETTER KEEP THEM YOU MAY FIND THEM USEFUL
5810-8674-0036 WEEPING THE BLIND YOUTH FELT HIS WAY TO THE GIANT'S HOUSE AND TOLD HIM ALL THE STORY THE GIANT WAS FULL OF PITY FOR THE POOR YOUNG MAN BUT INQUIRED ANXIOUSLY WHAT HE HAD DONE WITH THE EYES
5810-8674-0037 THE PRINCE DREW THEM OUT OF HIS POCKET AND SILENTLY HANDED THEM TO THE GIANT WHO WASHED THEM WELL AND THEN PUT THEM BACK IN THE PRINCE'S HEAD FOR THREE DAYS HE LAY IN UTTER DARKNESS THEN THE LIGHT BEGAN TO COME BACK
5810-8674-0038 TILL SOON HE SAW AS WELL AS EVER BUT THOUGH HE COULD NOT REJOICE ENOUGH OVER THE RECOVERY OF HIS EYES HE BEWAILED BITTERLY THE LOSS OF HIS SWORD AND THAT IT SHOULD HAVE FALLEN TO THE LOT OF HIS BITTER ENEMY
5810-8674-0039 NEVER MIND MY FRIEND SAID THE GIANT I WILL GET IT BACK FOR YOU AND HE SENT FOR THE MONKEY WHO WAS HIS HEAD SERVANT TELL THE FOX AND THE SQUIRREL THAT THEY ARE TO GO WITH YOU AND FETCH ME BACK THE PRINCE'S SWORD
5810-8674-0040 ORDERED HE THE THREE SERVANTS SET OUT AT ONCE ONE SEATED ON THE BACK OF THE OTHERS THE APE WHO DISLIKED WALKING BEING GENERALLY ON TOP DIRECTLY THEY CAME TO THE WINDOW OF THE ROBBER CAPTAIN'S ROOM
5810-8674-0041 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY AND THE SWORD HANGING FROM A NAIL HE TOOK IT DOWN AND BUCKLING IT ROUND HIS WAIST AS HE HAD SEEN THE PRINCE DO SWUNG HIMSELF DOWN AGAIN AND MOUNTING ON THE BACKS OF HIS TWO COMPANIONS HASTENED TO HIS MASTER
5810-8674-0042 THE GIANT BADE HIM GIVE THE SWORD TO THE PRINCE WHO GIRDED HIMSELF WITH IT AND RETURNED WITH ALL SPEED TO THE CASTLE COME OUT YOU RASCAL COME OUT YOU VILLAIN
5810-8674-0043 I WILL SHOW YOU WHO IS THE MASTER IN THIS HOUSE THE NOISE HE MADE BROUGHT THE ROBBER INTO THE ROOM HE GLANCED UP TO WHERE THE SWORD USUALLY HUNG BUT IT WAS GONE AND INSTINCTIVELY HE LOOKED AT THE PRINCE'S HAND
5810-8674-0044 WHERE HE SAW IT GLEAMING BRIGHTLY IN HIS TURN HE FELL ON HIS KNEES TO BEG FOR MERCY BUT IT WAS TOO LATE AS HE HAD DONE TO THE PRINCE SO THE PRINCE DID TO HIM AND BLINDED HE WAS THRUST FORTH
5810-8674-0045 AND FELL DOWN A DEEP HOLE WHERE HE IS TO THIS DAY HIS MOTHER THE PRINCE SENT BACK TO HER FATHER AND NEVER WOULD SEE HER AGAIN AFTER THIS HE RETURNED TO THE GIANT AND SAID TO HIM MY FRIEND
5810-8674-0046 ADD ONE MORE KINDNESS TO THOSE YOU HAVE ALREADY HEAPED ON ME GIVE ME YOUR DAUGHTER AS MY WIFE SO THEY WERE MARRIED AND THE WEDDING FEAST WAS SO SPLENDID THAT THERE WAS NOT A KINGDOM IN THE WORLD THAT DID NOT HEAR OF IT
5810-8674-0047 AND THE PRINCE NEVER WENT BACK TO HIS FATHER'S THRONE BUT LIVED PEACEFULLY WITH HIS WIFE IN THE FOREST WHERE
