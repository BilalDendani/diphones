1614-13759-0000 SMITH LAUGHED USELESS IN THE FIRST PLACE WHEREVER WE WENT HE WOULD FIND US AND OF WHAT USE TO ARREST HIS CREATURES WE COULD PROVE NOTHING AGAINST THEM FURTHER IT IS EVIDENT THAT AN ATTEMPT IS TO BE MADE UPON MY LIFE TO NIGHT
1614-13759-0001 AND BY THE SAME MEANS THAT PROVED SO SUCCESSFUL IN THE CASE OF POOR SIR CRICHTON
1614-13759-0002 AND HE LEAPT STORMILY TO HIS FEET SHAKING HIS CLENCHED FISTS TOWARDS THE WINDOW THE VILLAIN HE CRIED THE FIENDISHLY CLEVER VILLAIN I SUSPECTED THAT SIR CRICHTON WAS NEXT AND I WAS RIGHT BUT I CAME TOO LATE PETRIE THAT HITS ME HARD OLD MAN
1614-13759-0003 TO THINK THAT I KNEW AND YET FAILED TO SAVE HIM HE RESUMED HIS SEAT SMOKING HARD FU MANCHU HAS MADE THE BLUNDER COMMON TO ALL MEN OF UNUSUAL GENIUS HE SAID HE HAS UNDERRATED HIS ADVERSARY
1614-13759-0004 HE HAS NOT GIVEN ME CREDIT FOR PERCEIVING THE MEANING OF THE SCENTED MESSAGES HE HAS THROWN AWAY ONE POWERFUL WEAPON TO GET SUCH A MESSAGE INTO MY HANDS AND HE THINKS THAT ONCE SAFE WITHIN DOORS I SHALL SLEEP UNSUSPECTING AND DIE AS SIR CRICHTON DIED
1614-13759-0005 BUT WITHOUT THE INDISCRETION OF YOUR CHARMING FRIEND
1614-13759-0006 WHICH BY THE WAY CONSISTS OF A BLANK SHEET OF PAPER SMITH I BROKE IN WHO IS SHE SHE IS EITHER FU MANCHU'S DAUGHTER HIS WIFE
1614-13759-0007 FOR SHE HAS NO WILL BUT HIS WILL EXCEPT WITH A QUIZZICAL GLANCE IN A CERTAIN INSTANCE HOW CAN YOU JEST WITH SOME AWFUL THING HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT HANGING OVER YOUR HEAD WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THESE PERFUMED ENVELOPES
1614-13759-0008 HOW DID SIR CRICHTON DIE HE DIED OF THE ZAYAT KISS ASK ME WHAT THAT IS AND I REPLY I DO NOT KNOW
1614-13759-0009 ALONG A CERTAIN ROUTE UPON WHICH I SET EYES FOR THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME UPON DOCTOR FU MANCHU TRAVELERS WHO USE THEM SOMETIMES DIE AS SIR CRICHTON DIED
1614-13759-0010 WITH NOTHING TO SHOW THE CAUSE OF DEATH BUT A LITTLE MARK UPON THE NECK FACE OR LIMB WHICH HAS EARNED IN THOSE PARTS THE TITLE OF THE ZAYAT KISS THE REST HOUSES ALONG THAT ROUTE ARE SHUNNED NOW I HAVE MY THEORY
1614-13759-0011 AND I HOPE TO PROVE IT TO NIGHT IF I LIVE IT WILL BE ONE MORE BROKEN WEAPON IN HIS FIENDISH ARMORY AND IT IS THUS
1614-13759-0012 THIS WAS MY PRINCIPAL REASON FOR NOT ENLIGHTENING DOCTOR CLEEVE EVEN WALLS HAVE EARS WHERE FU MANCHU IS CONCERNED SO I FEIGNED IGNORANCE OF THE MEANING OF THE MARK KNOWING THAT HE WOULD BE ALMOST CERTAIN TO EMPLOY THE SAME METHODS UPON SOME OTHER VICTIM
1614-13759-0013 I WANTED AN OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THE ZAYAT KISS IN OPERATION AND I SHALL HAVE ONE BUT THE SCENTED ENVELOPES IN THE SWAMPY FORESTS OF THE DISTRICT I HAVE REFERRED TO A RARE SPECIES OF ORCHID ALMOST GREEN AND WITH A PECULIAR SCENT
1614-13759-0014 YOU RECALL THAT HE THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING CONCEALED IN HIS STUDY ON A PREVIOUS OCCASION FU MANCHU HIT UPON THE PERFUMED ENVELOPES HE MAY HAVE A SUPPLY OF THESE GREEN ORCHIDS IN HIS POSSESSION POSSIBLY TO FEED THE CREATURE WHAT CREATURE
1614-13759-0015 YOU NO DOUBT OBSERVED THAT I EXAMINED THE GRATE OF THE STUDY I FOUND A FAIR QUANTITY OF FALLEN SOOT
1614-13759-0016 AND I TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE THING WHATEVER IT WAS MUST STILL BE CONCEALED EITHER IN THE STUDY OR IN THE LIBRARY BUT WHEN I HAD OBTAINED THE EVIDENCE OF THE GROOM WILLS I PERCEIVED THAT THE CRY FROM THE LANE OR FROM THE PARK WAS A SIGNAL
1614-13759-0017 I NOTED THAT THE MOVEMENTS OF ANYONE SEATED AT THE STUDY TABLE WERE VISIBLE IN SHADOW ON THE BLIND AND THAT THE STUDY OCCUPIED THE CORNER OF A TWO STORIED WING AND THEREFORE HAD A SHORT CHIMNEY WHAT DID THE SIGNAL MEAN
1614-13759-0018 THAT SIR CRICHTON HAD LEAPED UP FROM HIS CHAIR AND EITHER HAD RECEIVED THE ZAYAT KISS
1614-13759-0019 HAD LOWERED DOWN THE STRAIGHT CHIMNEY IT WAS THE SIGNAL TO WITHDRAW THAT DEADLY THING BY MEANS OF THE IRON STAIRWAY AT THE REAR OF MAJOR GENERAL PLATT HOUSTON'S I QUITE EASILY GAINED ACCESS TO THE ROOF ABOVE SIR CRICHTON'S STUDY AND I FOUND THIS
1614-13759-0020 OUT FROM HIS POCKET NAYLAND SMITH DREW A TANGLED PIECE OF SILK MIXED UP WITH WHICH WERE A BRASS RING AND A NUMBER OF UNUSUALLY LARGE SIZED SPLIT SHOT
1614-13759-0021 MY THEORY PROVEN HE RESUMED NOT ANTICIPATING A SEARCH ON THE ROOF
1614-13759-0022 THIS WAS TO WEIGHT THE LINE AND TO PREVENT THE CREATURE CLINGING TO THE WALLS OF THE CHIMNEY
1614-13759-0023 AND THE THING WAS ONLY HELD BY ONE SLENDER THREAD WHICH SUFFICED THOUGH
1614-13759-0024 IT MIGHT HAVE GOT TANGLED OF COURSE
1614-13759-0025 FROM THERE TO THE HAND OF SIR CRICHTON WHICH FROM HAVING TOUCHED THE ENVELOPE WOULD ALSO BE SCENTED WITH THE PERFUME WAS A CERTAIN MOVE MY GOD HOW HORRIBLE I EXCLAIMED AND GLANCED APPREHENSIVELY INTO THE DUSKY SHADOWS OF THE ROOM
1614-13759-0026 WHAT IS YOUR THEORY RESPECTING THIS CREATURE WHAT SHAPE WHAT COLOR IT IS SOMETHING THAT MOVES RAPIDLY AND SILENTLY
1614-13759-0027 BUT I THINK IT WORKS IN THE DARK THE STUDY WAS DARK REMEMBER SAVE FOR THE BRIGHT PATCH BENEATH THE READING LAMP I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE REAR OF THIS HOUSE IS IVY COVERED RIGHT UP TO AND ABOVE YOUR BEDROOM LET US MAKE OSTENTATIOUS PREPARATIONS TO RETIRE
1614-13759-0028 AND I THINK WE MAY RELY UPON FU MANCHU'S SERVANTS TO ATTEMPT MY REMOVAL AT ANY RATE IF NOT YOURS BUT MY DEAR FELLOW IT IS A CLIMB OF THIRTY FIVE FEET AT THE VERY LEAST YOU REMEMBER THE CRY IN THE BACK LANE IT SUGGESTED SOMETHING TO ME
1614-13759-0029 AND I TESTED MY IDEA SUCCESSFULLY IT WAS THE CRY OF A DACOIT OH DACOITY THOUGH QUIESCENT IS BY NO MEANS EXTINCT FU MANCHU HAS DACOITS IN HIS TRAIN AND PROBABLY IT IS ONE WHO OPERATES THE ZAYAT KISS
1614-13759-0030 SINCE IT WAS A DACOIT WHO WATCHED THE WINDOW OF THE STUDY THIS EVENING TO SUCH A MAN AN IVY COVERED WALL IS A GRAND STAIRCASE THE HORRIBLE EVENTS THAT FOLLOWED ARE PUNCTUATED IN MY MIND BY THE STRIKING OF A DISTANT CLOCK
1614-13759-0031 IT IS SINGULAR HOW TRIVIALITIES THUS ASSERT THEMSELVES IN MOMENTS OF HIGH TENSION I WILL PROCEED THEN BY THESE PUNCTUATIONS TO THE COMING OF THE HORROR THAT IT WAS WRITTEN WE SHOULD ENCOUNTER THE CLOCK ACROSS THE COMMON STRUCK TWO
1614-13759-0032 HAVING REMOVED ALL TRACES OF THE SCENT OF THE ORCHID FROM OUR HANDS WITH A SOLUTION OF AMMONIA SMITH AND I HAD FOLLOWED THE PROGRAMME LAID DOWN IT WAS AN EASY MATTER TO REACH THE REAR OF THE HOUSE BY SIMPLY CLIMBING A FENCE AND WE DID NOT DOUBT
1614-13759-0033 THAT SEEING THE LIGHT GO OUT IN THE FRONT OUR UNSEEN WATCHER WOULD PROCEED TO THE BACK THE ROOM WAS A LARGE ONE AND WE HAD MADE UP MY CAMP BED AT ONE END STUFFING ODDS AND ENDS UNDER THE CLOTHES TO LEND THE APPEARANCE OF A SLEEPER
1614-13759-0034 THE PERFUMED ENVELOPE LAY UPON A LITTLE COFFEE TABLE IN THE CENTER OF THE FLOOR AND SMITH WITH AN ELECTRIC POCKET LAMP A REVOLVER AND A BRASSEY BESIDE HIM SAT ON CUSHIONS IN THE SHADOW OF THE WARDROBE I OCCUPIED A POST BETWEEN THE WINDOWS
1614-13759-0035 NO UNUSUAL SOUND SO FAR HAD DISTURBED THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT SAVE FOR THE MUFFLED THROB OF THE RARE ALL NIGHT CARS PASSING THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE OUR VIGIL HAD BEEN A SILENT ONE THE FULL MOON HAD PAINTED ABOUT THE FLOOR
1614-13759-0036 WEIRD SHADOWS OF THE CLUSTERING IVY SPREADING THE DESIGN GRADUALLY FROM THE DOOR ACROSS THE ROOM PAST THE LITTLE TABLE WHERE THE ENVELOPE LAY AND FINALLY TO THE FOOT OF THE BED THE DISTANT CLOCK STRUCK A QUARTER PAST TWO A SLIGHT BREEZE STIRRED THE IVY
1614-13759-0037 AND A NEW SHADOW ADDED ITSELF TO THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE MOON'S DESIGN SOMETHING ROSE INCH BY INCH ABOVE THE SILL OF THE WESTERLY WINDOW
1614-13759-0038 BUT A SHARP SIBILANT BREATH FROM SMITH TOLD ME THAT HE FROM HIS POST COULD SEE THE CAUSE OF THE SHADOW EVERY NERVE IN MY BODY SEEMED TO BE STRUNG TENSELY I WAS ICY COLD EXPECTANT
1614-13759-0039 THE SHADOW BECAME STATIONARY THE DACOIT WAS STUDYING THE INTERIOR OF THE ROOM THEN IT SUDDENLY LENGTHENED AND CRANING MY HEAD TO THE LEFT
1614-13759-0040 SKETCHY IN THE MOONLIGHT PRESSED AGAINST THE WINDOW PANES ONE THIN BROWN HAND APPEARED OVER THE EDGE OF THE LOWERED SASH WHICH IT GRASPED AND THEN ANOTHER THE MAN MADE ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND WHATEVER THE SECOND HAND DISAPPEARED AND REAPPEARED
1614-13759-0041 CLICK THE DACOIT SWUNG HIMSELF BELOW THE WINDOW WITH THE AGILITY OF AN APE AS WITH A DULL MUFFLED THUD
1614-13759-0042 STAND STILL FOR YOUR LIFE CAME SMITH'S VOICE HIGH PITCHED
1614-13759-0043 PREPARED AS I WAS FOR SOMETHING HORRIBLE
1614-13759-0044 IT WAS AN INSECT FULL SIX INCHES LONG AND OF A VIVID VENOMOUS RED COLOR IT HAD SOMETHING OF THE APPEARANCE OF A GREAT ANT
1614-13759-0045 AND ITS FEBRILE HORRIBLE VITALITY
1614-13759-0046 AND HAD NUMBERLESS RAPIDLY MOVING LEGS IN SHORT IT WAS A GIANT CENTIPEDE APPARENTLY OF THE SCOLOPENDRA GROUP BUT OF A FORM QUITE NEW TO ME THESE THINGS I REALIZED IN ONE BREATHLESS INSTANT
1614-13759-0047 I LEAPED TO THE WINDOW AND THREW IT WIDELY OPEN FEELING A SILK THREAD BRUSH MY HAND AS I DID SO A BLACK SHAPE WAS DROPPING WITH INCREDIBLE AGILITY FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH OF THE IVY AND WITHOUT ONCE OFFERING A MARK FOR A REVOLVER SHOT
1614-13759-0048 IT MERGED INTO THE SHADOWS BENEATH THE TREES OF THE GARDEN AS I TURNED AND SWITCHED ON THE LIGHT NAYLAND SMITH DROPPED LIMPLY INTO A CHAIR LEANING HIS HEAD UPON HIS HANDS EVEN THAT GRIM COURAGE HAD BEEN TRIED SORELY
1614-13759-0049 NEVER MIND THE DACOIT PETRIE HE SAID NEMESIS WILL KNOW WHERE TO FIND HIM WE KNOW NOW WHAT CAUSES THE MARK OF THE ZAYAT KISS THEREFORE SCIENCE IS RICHER FOR OUR FIRST BRUSH WITH THE ENEMY AND THE ENEMY IS POORER
1614-13759-0050 SINCE I HEARD OF IT SIR CRICHTON'S STIFLED CRY WHEN WE REMEMBER THAT HE WAS ALMOST PAST SPEECH IT IS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT HIS CRY WAS NOT THE RED HAND BUT THE RED ANT PETRIE
