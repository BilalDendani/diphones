4381-14897-0000 BEFORE THE KENNEL CLUB FOUND IT NECESSARY TO INSIST UPON A PRECISE DEFINITION OF EACH BREED THE DALMATIAN WAS KNOWN AS THE COACH DOG
4381-14897-0001 A NAME APPROPRIATELY DERIVED FROM HIS FONDNESS FOR FOLLOWING A CARRIAGE FOR LIVING IN AND ABOUT THE STABLE AND FOR ACCOMPANYING HIS MASTER'S HORSES AT EXERCISE
4381-14897-0002 KEEPING EASY PACE WITH THE BEST HORSES HE APPEARS ALMOST TO PREFER EQUINE TO HUMAN COMPANIONSHIP AND HE IS AS FOND OF BEING AMONG HORSES AS THE COLLIE IS OF BEING IN THE MIDST OF SHEEP
4381-14897-0003 YET HE IS OF FRIENDLY DISPOSITION AND IT MUST BE INSISTED THAT HE IS BY NO MEANS SO DESTITUTE OF INTELLIGENCE AS HE IS OFTEN REPRESENTED TO BE ON THE CONTRARY
4381-14897-0004 HE IS CAPABLE OF BEING TRAINED INTO REMARKABLE CLEVERNESS AS CIRCUS PROPRIETORS HAVE DISCOVERED THE EARLIEST AUTHORITIES AGREE THAT THIS BREED WAS FIRST INTRODUCED FROM DALMATIA AND THAT HE WAS BROUGHT INTO THIS COUNTRY
4381-14897-0005 PURELY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS SPORTING PROCLIVITIES OF LATE YEARS HOWEVER THESE DOGS HAVE SO FAR DEGENERATED AS TO BE LOOKED UPON SIMPLY AS COMPANIONS OR AS EXHIBITION DOGS
4381-14897-0006 FOR ONLY VERY OCCASIONALLY CAN IT BE FOUND THAT ANY PAINS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO TRAIN THEM SYSTEMATICALLY FOR GUN WORK THE FIRST OF THE VARIETY WHICH APPEARED IN THE SHOW RING WAS MISTER JAMES FAWDRY'S CAPTAIN
4381-14897-0007 IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE AT THAT PERIOD THEY WERE LOOKED UPON AS A NOVELTY
4381-14897-0008 AND THOUGH THE GENEROSITY AND INFLUENCE OF A FEW ADMIRERS ENSURED SEPARATE CLASSES BEING PROVIDED FOR THE BREED AT THE LEADING SHOWS IT DID NOT NECESSITATE THE PRODUCTION
4381-14897-0009 OF SUCH PERFECT SPECIMENS AS THOSE WHICH A FEW YEARS AFTERWARDS WON PRIZES AT THE FIRST THEY WERE MORE POPULAR IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF GREAT BRITAIN IT WAS AT KIRKBY LONSDALE
4381-14897-0010 THAT DOCTOR JAMES'S SPOTTED DICK WAS BRED AND AN EARLY EXPLOITER OF THE BREED WHO MADE HIS DOGS FAMOUS WAS MISTER NEWBY WILSON OF LAKESIDE WINDERMERE
4381-14897-0011 HE WAS INDEBTED TO MISTER HUGO DROESSE OF LONDON FOR THE FOUNDATION OF HIS STUD INASMUCH AS IT WAS FROM MISTER DROESSE
4381-14897-0012 AT A LATER DATE THE FAMED COMING STILL
4381-14897-0013 THE LATTER DOG BEING THE PROGENITOR OF MOST OF THE BEST LIVER SPOTTED SPECIMENS THAT HAVE ATTAINED NOTORIETY AS PRIZE WINNERS DOWN TO THE PRESENT DAY IN APPEARANCE THE DALMATIAN SHOULD BE VERY SIMILAR TO A POINTER
4381-14897-0014 EXCEPT IN HEAD AND MARKING STILL
4381-14897-0015 NOR SO PENDULOUS IN LIP AS A POINTER THERE SHOULD BE NO COARSENESS OR COMMON LOOK ABOUT THE SKULL A FAULT WHICH IS MUCH TOO PREVALENT
4381-14897-0016 THEN AGAIN SOME JUDGES DO NOT ATTACH SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE TO THE EYELIDS OR RATHER SEARS WHICH SHOULD INVARIABLY BE EDGED ROUND WITH BLACK OR BROWN THOSE WHICH ARE FLESH COLOURED IN THIS PARTICULAR SHOULD BE DISCARDED
4381-14897-0017 IN BOTH BLACKS AND BROWNS IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE BUT SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO OUTWEIGH THE EVENNESS OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF SPOTS ON THE BODY NO BLACK PATCHES OR EVEN MINGLING OF THE SPOTS SHOULD MEET WITH FAVOUR
4381-14897-0018 ANY MORE THAN A RING TAIL OR A CLUMSY LOOKING HEAVY SHOULDERED DOG
4381-14897-0019 THE UNINITIATED MAY BE INFORMED THAT DALMATIAN PUPPIES ARE ALWAYS BORN PURE WHITE THE CLEARER AND WHITER THEY ARE THE BETTER THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE THERE SHOULD NOT BE THE SHADOW OF A MARK OR SPOT ON THEM
4381-14897-0020 WHEN ABOUT A FORTNIGHT OLD HOWEVER THEY GENERALLY DEVELOP A DARK RIDGE ON THE BELLY AND THE SPOTS WILL THEN BEGIN TO SHOW THEMSELVES FIRST ABOUT THE NECK AND EARS AND AFTERWARDS ALONG THE BACK
4381-14897-0021 UNTIL AT ABOUT THE SIXTEENTH DAY THE MARKINGS ARE DISTINCT OVER THE BODY EXCEPTING ONLY THE TAIL WHICH FREQUENTLY REMAINS WHITE FOR A FEW WEEKS LONGER THE STANDARD OF POINTS AS LAID DOWN BY THE LEADING CLUB
4381-14897-0022 IS SUFFICIENTLY EXPLICIT TO BE EASILY UNDERSTOOD AND IS AS FOLLOWS GENERAL APPEARANCE THE DALMATIAN SHOULD REPRESENT A STRONG MUSCULAR AND ACTIVE DOG SYMMETRICAL IN OUTLINE
4381-14897-0023 AND FREE FROM COARSENESS AND LUMBER CAPABLE OF GREAT ENDURANCE COMBINED WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF SPEED HEAD THE HEAD SHOULD BE OF A FAIR LENGTH THE SKULL FLAT RATHER BROAD BETWEEN THE EARS
4381-14897-0024 AND MODERATELY WELL DEFINED AT THE TEMPLES
4381-14897-0025 EXHIBITING A MODERATE AMOUNT OF STOP AND NOT IN ONE STRAIGHT LINE FROM THE NOSE TO THE OCCIPUT BONE AS REQUIRED IN A BULL TERRIER IT SHOULD BE ENTIRELY FREE FROM WRINKLE MUZZLE
4381-14897-0026 THOUGH WELL DEFINED THE HOCKS WELL LET DOWN NAILS THE NAILS IN THE BLACK SPOTTED VARIETY SHOULD BE BLACK AND WHITE IN THE LIVER SPOTTED VARIETY BROWN AND WHITE TAIL THE TAIL SHOULD NOT BE TOO LONG
4381-14897-0027 STRONG AT THE INSERTION AND GRADUALLY TAPERING TOWARDS THE END FREE FROM COARSENESS IT SHOULD NOT BE INSERTED TOO LOW DOWN BUT CARRIED WITH A SLIGHT CURVE UPWARDS AND NEVER CURLED
