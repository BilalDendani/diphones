6339-65534-0000 THE TAUNTON SCHOOL HAD CLOSED FOR THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS CONSTANCE FOSTER AND MISS CHANNING WENT DOWN THE LONG ELM SHADED STREET TOGETHER AS THEY GENERALLY DID BECAUSE THEY HAPPENED TO BOARD ON THE SAME BLOCK DOWNTOWN CONSTANCE WAS THE YOUNGEST TEACHER ON THE STAFF
6339-65534-0001 AND HAD CHARGE OF THE PRIMARY DEPARTMENT SHE HAD TAUGHT IN TAUNTON SCHOOL A YEAR AND AT ITS CLOSE SHE WAS AS MUCH OF A STRANGER IN THE LITTLE CORPS OF TEACHERS AS SHE HAD BEEN AT THE BEGINNING THE OTHERS THOUGHT HER STIFF AND UNAPPROACHABLE
6339-65534-0002 SHE WAS UNPOPULAR IN A NEGATIVE WAY WITH ALL EXCEPT MISS CHANNING
6339-65534-0003 THE MORE SO IF OTHER PEOPLE DISLIKED THEM MISS CHANNING WAS THE OLDEST TEACHER ON THE STAFF AND TAUGHT THE FIFTH GRADE SHE WAS SHORT AND STOUT AND JOLLY NOTHING NOT EVEN THE ICIEST RESERVE EVER DAUNTED MISS CHANNING
6339-65534-0004 TWO MONTHS TO DREAM TO BE LAZY TO GO WHERE ONE PLEASES NO EXERCISES TO CORRECT NO REPORTS TO MAKE NO PUPILS TO KEEP IN ORDER TO BE SURE I LOVE THEM EVERY ONE
6339-65534-0005 THAT IS WHY I'VE HATED TO HEAR YOU AND THE OTHERS DISCUSSING YOUR VACATION PLANS YOU ALL HAVE SOMEBODY TO GO TO
6339-65534-0006 MISS CHANNING SWALLOWED HER HONEST HORROR AT SUCH A STATE OF FEELING CONSTANCE TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF
6339-65534-0007 YOU SEEM SO RESERVED AND AND AS IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE ASKED ABOUT YOURSELF I KNOW IT
6339-65534-0008 IT'S THE TRUTH AND IT HURTS ME BUT I CAN'T HELP IT I'M GETTING MORE BITTER AND PESSIMISTIC AND UNWHOLESOME EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE SOMETIMES IT SEEMS AS IF I HATED ALL THE WORLD BECAUSE I'M SO LONELY IN IT I'M NOBODY MY MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS BORN
6339-65534-0009 AND FATHER OH I DON'T KNOW ONE CAN'T SAY ANYTHING AGAINST ONE'S FATHER MISS CHANNING BUT I HAD A HARD CHILDHOOD OR RATHER I DIDN'T HAVE ANY CHILDHOOD AT ALL WE WERE ALWAYS MOVING ABOUT WE DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY FRIENDS AT ALL
6339-65534-0010 MY MOTHER MIGHT HAVE HAD RELATIVES SOMEWHERE BUT I NEVER HEARD OF ANY I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE HER HOME WAS FATHER NEVER WOULD TALK OF HER HE DIED TWO YEARS AGO AND SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN ABSOLUTELY ALONE OH YOU POOR GIRL SAID MISS CHANNING SOFTLY
6339-65534-0011 I WANT FRIENDS WENT ON CONSTANCE
6339-65534-0012 I'VE ALWAYS JUST LONGED FOR SOMEBODY BELONGING TO ME TO LOVE
6339-65534-0013 AND WHEN A GIRL IS IN THAT STATE SHE IS ALL WRONG SHE GETS HARD AND BITTER AND RESENTFUL I HAVE ANYWAY I STRUGGLED AGAINST IT AT FIRST BUT IT HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR ME IT POISONS EVERYTHING THERE IS NOBODY TO CARE ANYTHING ABOUT ME
6339-65534-0014 WHETHER I LIVE OR DIE OH YES THERE IS ONE SAID MISS CHANNING GENTLY GOD CARES CONSTANCE CONSTANCE GAVE A DISAGREEABLE LITTLE LAUGH THAT SOUNDS LIKE MISS WILLIAMS
6339-65534-0015 GOD DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO ME MISS CHANNING I'VE JUST THE SAME RESENTFUL FEELING TOWARD HIM THAT I HAVE FOR ALL THE WORLD IF HE EXISTS AT ALL THERE I'VE SHOCKED YOU IN GOOD EARNEST NOW
6339-65534-0016 NO YOU HAVEN'T SHOCKED ME
6339-65534-0017 I'M ONLY TERRIBLY SORRY OH NEVER MIND ME SAID CONSTANCE
6339-65534-0018 MISS CHANNING WALKED ON IN SILENCE SHE MUST HELP CONSTANCE BUT CONSTANCE WAS NOT EASILY HELPED WHEN SCHOOL REOPENED SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WORTHWHILE FOR THE GIRL BUT JUST NOW THE ONLY THING TO DO
6339-65534-0019 YOU SPOKE OF BOARDING SHE SAID WHEN CONSTANCE PAUSED AT THE DOOR OF HER BOARDING HOUSE HAVE YOU ANY PARTICULAR PLACE IN VIEW
6339-65534-0020 I WAS THERE TWO SUMMERS AGO

6339-65534-0022 BUT LISTEN TO ME DEAR DON'T TAKE YOUR MORBIDNESS WITH YOU OPEN YOUR HEART TO THE SUMMER AND LET ITS SUNSHINE IN AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN THE FALL COME PREPARED TO LET US ALL BE YOUR FRIENDS WE'D LIKE TO BE
6339-65534-0023 AND WHILE FRIENDSHIP DOESN'T TAKE THE PLACE OF THE LOVE OF ONE'S OWN PEOPLE STILL IT IS A GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL THING BESIDES THERE ARE OTHER UNHAPPY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TRY TO HELP THEM WHEN YOU MEET THEM AND YOU'LL FORGET ABOUT YOURSELF
6339-65534-0024 GOOD BY FOR NOW AND I HOPE YOU'LL HAVE A PLEASANT VACATION IN SPITE OF YOURSELF CONSTANCE WENT TO PINE VALLEY BUT SHE TOOK HER EVIL SPIRIT WITH HER
6339-65534-0025 NOT EVEN THE BEAUTY OF THE VALLEY WITH ITS GREAT BALMY PINES AND THE CHEERFUL FRIENDLINESS OF ITS PEOPLE COULD EXORCISE IT NEVERTHELESS
6339-65534-0026 SHE TOLD HER LANDLADY ONE EVENING IT IS ABOUT THREE MILES FROM HERE AT THE END OF THE VALLEY SUCH A PICTURESQUE
6339-65534-0027 HEARTSEASE FARM SAID MISSUS HEWITT PROMPTLY BLESS YOU THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE AROUND HERE OF THAT DESCRIPTION MISTER AND MISSUS BRUCE
6339-65534-0028 THEY ARE THE DEAREST OLD COUPLE ALIVE YOU OUGHT TO GO AND SEE THEM THEY'D BE DELIGHTED AUNT FLORA JUST LOVES COMPANY
6339-65534-0029 ASKED CONSTANCE INDIFFERENTLY HER INTEREST WAS IN THE PLACE NOT IN THE PEOPLE
6339-65534-0030 THEY BROUGHT HER UP AND THEY JUST WORSHIPPED HER SHE RAN AWAY WITH A WORTHLESS FELLOW I FORGET HIS NAME IF I EVER KNEW IT HE WAS HANDSOME AND SMOOTH TONGUED BUT HE WAS A SCAMP SHE DIED SOON AFTER AND IT JUST BROKE THEIR HEARTS
6339-65534-0031 THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE SHE WAS BURIED AND THEY NEVER HEARD ANYTHING MORE ABOUT HER HUSBAND I'VE HEARD THAT AUNT FLORA'S HAIR TURNED SNOW WHITE IN A MONTH I'LL TAKE YOU UP TO SEE HER SOME DAY WHEN I FIND TIME MISSUS HEWITT DID NOT FIND TIME
6339-65534-0032 BUT THEREAFTER CONSTANCE ORDERED HER RAMBLES THAT SHE MIGHT FREQUENTLY PASS HEARTSEASE FARM THE QUAINT OLD SPOT HAD A STRANGE ATTRACTION FOR HER SHE FOUND HERSELF LEARNING TO LOVE IT
6339-65534-0033 AND SO UNUSED WAS THIS UNFORTUNATE GIRL TO LOVING ANYTHING THAT SHE LAUGHED AT HERSELF FOR HER FOOLISHNESS ONE EVENING A FORTNIGHT LATER CONSTANCE WITH HER ARMS FULL OF FERNS AND WOOD LILIES CAME OUT OF THE PINE WOODS ABOVE HEARTSEASE FARM
6339-65534-0034 AND IT WAS NOW NEARLY NIGHT AND VERY CERTAINLY A RAINY NIGHT AT THAT SHE WAS THREE MILES FROM HOME AND WITHOUT EVEN AN EXTRA WRAP
6339-65534-0035 THE FEW DROPS HAD BECOME A DOWNPOUR SHE MUST SEEK SHELTER SOMEWHERE AND HEARTSEASE FARM WAS THE NEAREST SHE PUSHED OPEN THE GATE AND RAN UP THE SLOPE OF THE YARD BETWEEN THE HEDGES OF SWEETBRIAR
6339-65534-0036 AND I JUST RAN DOWN AS FAST AS I COULD DEAR DEAR YOU ARE A LITTLE WET BUT WE'LL SOON DRY YOU COME RIGHT IN
6339-65534-0037 THEY LAUGHED AT ME FOR LOVING A FIRE SO BUT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE ITS SNAP AND SPARKLE
6339-65534-0038 I KNOW WHO YOU ARE YOU ARE MISS FOSTER I'M AUNT FLORA AND THIS IS UNCLE CHARLES CONSTANCE LET HERSELF BE PUT INTO A CUSHIONY CHAIR AND FUSSED OVER WITH AN UNACCUSTOMED SENSE OF PLEASURE THE RAIN WAS COMING DOWN IN TORRENTS
6339-65534-0039 AND SHE CERTAINLY WAS DOMICILED AT HEARTSEASE FARM FOR THE NIGHT SOMEHOW SHE FELT GLAD OF IT
6339-65534-0040 THE NAME OF THEIR FARM WAS IN PERFECT KEEPING WITH THEIR ATMOSPHERE CONSTANCE'S FROZEN SOUL EXPANDED IN IT SHE CHATTED MERRILY AND GIRLISHLY FEELING AS IF SHE HAD KNOWN THEM ALL HER LIFE
6339-65534-0041 WHEN BEDTIME CAME AUNT FLORA TOOK HER UPSTAIRS TO A LITTLE GABLE ROOM
6339-65534-0042 SO I'M GOING TO PUT YOU HERE IN JEANNIE'S ROOM SOMEWAY YOU REMIND ME OF HER AND YOU ARE JUST ABOUT THE AGE SHE WAS WHEN SHE LEFT US IF IT WASN'T FOR THAT I DON'T THINK I COULD PUT YOU IN HER ROOM
6339-65534-0043 IT IS SO SACRED TO ME I KEEP IT JUST AS SHE LEFT IT NOT A THING IS CHANGED GOOD NIGHT DEARIE AND I HOPE YOU'LL HAVE PLEASANT DREAMS WHEN CONSTANCE FOUND HERSELF ALONE IN THE ROOM
6339-65534-0044 THE FLOOR WAS COVERED WITH BRAIDED MATS THE TWO SQUARE SMALL PANED WINDOWS WERE DRAPED WITH SNOWY MUSLIN IN ONE CORNER WAS A LITTLE WHITE BED WITH WHITE CURTAINS AND DAINTILY RUFFLED PILLOWS
6339-65534-0045 IN THE WORK BASKET WAS A BIT OF UNFINISHED YELLOWED LACE WITH A NEEDLE STICKING IN IT A SMALL BOOKCASE UNDER THE SLOPING CEILING WAS FILLED WITH BOOKS CONSTANCE PICKED UP ONE AND OPENED IT AT THE YELLOWING TITLE PAGE
6339-65534-0046 DAINTY SCRIPT WAS JEAN CONSTANCE IRVING
6339-65534-0047 MISTER AND MISSUS BRUCE WERE STILL IN THE SITTING ROOM TALKING TO EACH OTHER IN THE FIRELIGHT OH CRIED CONSTANCE EXCITEDLY I MUST KNOW I MUST ASK YOU THIS IS MY MOTHER'S NAME
6339-65534-0048 A FORTNIGHT LATER MISS CHANNING RECEIVED A LETTER FROM CONSTANCE I AM SO HAPPY SHE WROTE OH MISS CHANNING I HAVE FOUND MINE OWN PEOPLE AND HEARTSEASE FARM IS TO BE MY OWN OWN DEAR HOME FOR ALWAYS
6339-65534-0049 IT WAS SUCH A STRANGE COINCIDENCE NO
6339-65534-0050 MY OWN DEAR MOTHER'S ROOM AND I FOUND HER NAME IN A BOOK AND NOW THE MYSTERY IS ALL CLEARED UP AND WE ARE SO HAPPY EVERYTHING IS DEAR AND BEAUTIFUL
6339-65534-0051 THE MOTHER I NEVER KNEW BEFORE SHE NO LONGER SEEMS DEAD TO ME I FEEL THAT SHE LIVES AND LOVES ME AND I AM LEARNING TO KNOW HER BETTER EVERY DAY I HAVE HER ROOM AND HER BOOKS AND ALL HER LITTLE GIRLISH POSSESSIONS
6339-65534-0052 I FEEL AS IF SHE WERE SPEAKING TO ME SHE WAS VERY GOOD AND SWEET IN SPITE OF HER ONE FOOLISH BITTER MISTAKE
6339-65534-0053 GOD MEANS SOMETHING TO ME NOW HE MEANS SO MUCH I REMEMBER THAT YOU SAID TO ME THAT HE MEANT NOTHING TO ME BECAUSE I HAD NO HUMAN LOVE IN MY HEART TO TRANSLATE THE DIVINE
6339-65534-0054 IT IS SO SWEET TO SAY HOME AND KNOW WHAT IT MEANS
6339-65534-0055 AFTER ALL THERE IS NO NEED OF THE BLUE PILLS I FEEL LIKE A NEW CREATURE
6339-65534-0056 I LOOK BACK WITH SHAME AND CONTRITION ON THE OLD CONSTANCE
