7874-110243-0000 BASKERVILLE HALL OCTOBER FIFTEENTH MY DEAR HOLMES IF I WAS COMPELLED TO LEAVE YOU WITHOUT MUCH NEWS DURING THE EARLY DAYS OF MY MISSION
7874-110243-0001 IN SOME WAYS THEY HAVE WITHIN THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS BECOME MUCH CLEARER AND IN SOME WAYS THEY HAVE BECOME MORE COMPLICATED BUT I WILL TELL YOU ALL AND YOU SHALL JUDGE FOR YOURSELF BEFORE BREAKFAST ON THE MORNING FOLLOWING MY ADVENTURE
7874-110243-0002 IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE THAT BARRYMORE SINCE ONLY THIS WINDOW WOULD SERVE THE PURPOSE MUST HAVE BEEN LOOKING OUT FOR SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY UPON THE MOOR THE NIGHT WAS VERY DARK SO THAT I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE HOW HE COULD HAVE HOPED TO SEE ANYONE
7874-110243-0003 IT HAD STRUCK ME THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT SOME LOVE INTRIGUE WAS ON FOOT THAT WOULD HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR HIS STEALTHY MOVEMENTS AND ALSO FOR THE UNEASINESS OF HIS WIFE THE MAN IS A STRIKING LOOKING FELLOW VERY WELL EQUIPPED TO STEAL THE HEART OF A COUNTRY GIRL
7874-110243-0004 SO THAT THIS THEORY SEEMED TO HAVE SOMETHING TO SUPPORT IT THAT OPENING OF THE DOOR WHICH I HAD HEARD AFTER I HAD RETURNED TO MY ROOM MIGHT MEAN THAT HE HAD GONE OUT TO KEEP SOME CLANDESTINE APPOINTMENT SO I REASONED WITH MYSELF IN THE MORNING AND I TELL YOU THE DIRECTION OF MY SUSPICIONS
7874-110243-0005 AND I TOLD HIM ALL THAT I HAD SEEN HE WAS LESS SURPRISED THAN I HAD EXPECTED I KNEW THAT BARRYMORE WALKED ABOUT NIGHTS AND I HAD A MIND TO SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT IT SAID HE TWO OR THREE TIMES I HAVE HEARD HIS STEPS IN THE PASSAGE COMING AND GOING
7874-110243-0006 JUST ABOUT THE HOUR YOU NAME PERHAPS THEN HE PAYS A VISIT EVERY NIGHT TO THAT PARTICULAR WINDOW I SUGGESTED PERHAPS HE DOES IF SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHADOW HIM AND SEE WHAT IT IS THAT HE IS AFTER I WONDER WHAT YOUR FRIEND HOLMES WOULD DO IF HE WERE HERE
7874-110243-0007 I BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU NOW SUGGEST SAID I HE WOULD FOLLOW BARRYMORE AND SEE WHAT HE DID THEN WE SHALL DO IT TOGETHER BUT SURELY HE WOULD HEAR US THE MAN IS RATHER DEAF AND IN ANY CASE
7874-110243-0008 WE MUST TAKE OUR CHANCE OF THAT WE'LL SIT UP IN MY ROOM TONIGHT AND WAIT UNTIL HE PASSES SIR HENRY RUBBED HIS HANDS WITH PLEASURE AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HAILED THE ADVENTURE AS A RELIEF TO HIS SOMEWHAT QUIET LIFE UPON THE MOOR
7874-110243-0009 THE BARONET HAS BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE ARCHITECT WHO PREPARED THE PLANS FOR SIR CHARLES AND WITH A CONTRACTOR FROM LONDON SO THAT WE MAY EXPECT GREAT CHANGES TO BEGIN HERE SOON
7874-110243-0010 AND IT IS EVIDENT THAT OUR FRIEND HAS LARGE IDEAS AND MEANS TO SPARE NO PAINS OR EXPENSE TO RESTORE THE GRANDEUR OF HIS FAMILY WHEN THE HOUSE IS RENOVATED AND REFURNISHED ALL THAT HE WILL NEED WILL BE A WIFE TO MAKE IT COMPLETE BETWEEN OURSELVES
7874-110243-0011 THERE ARE PRETTY CLEAR SIGNS THAT THIS WILL NOT BE WANTING IF THE LADY IS WILLING FOR I HAVE SELDOM SEEN A MAN MORE INFATUATED WITH A WOMAN THAN HE IS WITH OUR BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBOUR MISS STAPLETON
7874-110243-0012 AND YET THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE DOES NOT RUN QUITE AS SMOOTHLY AS ONE WOULD UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES EXPECT TODAY FOR EXAMPLE ITS SURFACE WAS BROKEN BY A VERY UNEXPECTED RIPPLE WHICH HAS CAUSED OUR FRIEND CONSIDERABLE PERPLEXITY AND ANNOYANCE
7874-110243-0013 AFTER THE CONVERSATION WHICH I HAVE QUOTED ABOUT BARRYMORE SIR HENRY PUT ON HIS HAT AND PREPARED TO GO OUT AS A MATTER OF COURSE I DID THE SAME WHAT ARE YOU COMING WATSON HE ASKED
7874-110243-0014 LOOKING AT ME IN A CURIOUS WAY THAT DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU ARE GOING ON THE MOOR SAID I YES I AM
7874-110243-0015 AM SORRY TO INTRUDE BUT YOU HEARD HOW EARNESTLY HOLMES INSISTED THAT I SHOULD NOT LEAVE YOU AND ESPECIALLY THAT YOU SHOULD NOT GO ALONE UPON THE MOOR SIR HENRY PUT HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER WITH A PLEASANT SMILE MY DEAR FELLOW SAID HE HOLMES WITH ALL HIS WISDOM
7874-110243-0016 DID NOT FORESEE SOME THINGS WHICH HAVE HAPPENED SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON THE MOOR YOU UNDERSTAND ME I AM SURE THAT YOU ARE THE LAST MAN IN THE WORLD WHO WOULD WISH TO BE A SPOIL SPORT I MUST GO OUT ALONE IT PUT ME IN A MOST AWKWARD POSITION
7874-110243-0017 I WAS AT A LOSS WHAT TO SAY OR WHAT TO DO
7874-110243-0018 BUT WHEN I CAME TO THINK THE MATTER OVER MY CONSCIENCE REPROACHED ME BITTERLY FOR HAVING ON ANY PRETEXT ALLOWED HIM TO GO OUT OF MY SIGHT
7874-110243-0019 I ASSURE YOU MY CHEEKS FLUSHED AT THE VERY THOUGHT IT MIGHT NOT EVEN NOW BE TOO LATE TO OVERTAKE HIM SO I SET OFF AT ONCE IN THE DIRECTION OF MERRIPIT HOUSE I HURRIED ALONG THE ROAD AT THE TOP OF MY SPEED WITHOUT SEEING ANYTHING OF SIR HENRY
7874-110243-0020 THERE FEARING THAT PERHAPS I HAD COME IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AFTER ALL I MOUNTED A HILL FROM WHICH I COULD COMMAND A VIEW THE SAME HILL WHICH IS CUT INTO THE DARK QUARRY THENCE I SAW HIM AT ONCE HE WAS ON THE MOOR PATH ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE OFF
7874-110243-0021 AND A LADY WAS BY HIS SIDE WHO COULD ONLY BE MISS STAPLETON IT WAS CLEAR THAT THERE WAS ALREADY AN UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THEM AND THAT THEY HAD MET BY APPOINTMENT THEY WERE WALKING SLOWLY ALONG IN DEEP CONVERSATION
7874-110243-0022 AND I SAW HER MAKING QUICK LITTLE MOVEMENTS OF HER HANDS AS IF SHE WERE VERY EARNEST IN WHAT SHE WAS SAYING WHILE HE LISTENED INTENTLY AND ONCE OR TWICE SHOOK HIS HEAD IN STRONG DISSENT I STOOD AMONG THE ROCKS WATCHING THEM
7874-110243-0023 VERY MUCH PUZZLED AS TO WHAT I SHOULD DO NEXT TO FOLLOW THEM AND BREAK INTO THEIR INTIMATE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE AN OUTRAGE AND YET MY CLEAR DUTY WAS NEVER FOR AN INSTANT TO LET HIM OUT OF MY SIGHT TO ACT THE SPY UPON A FRIEND WAS A HATEFUL TASK
7874-110243-0024 STILL I COULD SEE NO BETTER COURSE THAN TO OBSERVE HIM FROM THE HILL AND TO CLEAR MY CONSCIENCE BY CONFESSING TO HIM AFTERWARDS WHAT I HAD DONE IT IS TRUE THAT IF ANY SUDDEN DANGER HAD THREATENED HIM I WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO BE OF USE
7874-110243-0025 AND YET I AM SURE THAT YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT THE POSITION WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE WHICH I COULD DO OUR FRIEND SIR HENRY AND THE LADY HAD HALTED ON THE PATH AND WERE STANDING DEEPLY ABSORBED IN THEIR CONVERSATION
7874-110243-0026 WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY AWARE THAT I WAS NOT THE ONLY WITNESS OF THEIR INTERVIEW A WISP OF GREEN FLOATING IN THE AIR CAUGHT MY EYE AND ANOTHER GLANCE SHOWED ME THAT IT WAS CARRIED ON A STICK BY A MAN WHO WAS MOVING AMONG THE BROKEN GROUND
7874-110243-0027 IT WAS STAPLETON WITH HIS BUTTERFLY NET HE WAS VERY MUCH CLOSER TO THE PAIR THAN I WAS AND HE APPEARED TO BE MOVING IN THEIR DIRECTION AT THIS INSTANT SIR HENRY SUDDENLY DREW MISS STAPLETON TO HIS SIDE HIS ARM WAS ROUND HER
7874-110243-0028 BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SHE WAS STRAINING AWAY FROM HIM WITH HER FACE AVERTED HE STOOPED HIS HEAD TO HERS AND SHE RAISED ONE HAND AS IF IN PROTEST NEXT MOMENT I SAW THEM SPRING APART AND TURN HURRIEDLY ROUND STAPLETON WAS THE CAUSE OF THE INTERRUPTION
7874-110243-0029 HE WAS RUNNING WILDLY TOWARDS THEM HIS ABSURD NET DANGLING BEHIND HIM HE GESTICULATED AND ALMOST DANCED WITH EXCITEMENT IN FRONT OF THE LOVERS WHAT THE SCENE MEANT I COULD NOT IMAGINE BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT STAPLETON WAS ABUSING SIR HENRY
7874-110243-0030 WHO OFFERED EXPLANATIONS WHICH BECAME MORE ANGRY AS THE OTHER REFUSED TO ACCEPT THEM THE LADY STOOD BY IN HAUGHTY SILENCE FINALLY STAPLETON TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND BECKONED IN A PEREMPTORY WAY TO HIS SISTER WHO
7874-110243-0031 AFTER AN IRRESOLUTE GLANCE AT SIR HENRY WALKED OFF BY THE SIDE OF HER BROTHER THE NATURALIST'S ANGRY GESTURES SHOWED THAT THE LADY WAS INCLUDED IN HIS DISPLEASURE THE BARONET STOOD FOR A MINUTE LOOKING AFTER THEM
7874-110243-0032 HIS HEAD HANGING THE VERY PICTURE OF DEJECTION WHAT ALL THIS MEANT I COULD NOT IMAGINE
7874-110243-0033 YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE MIDDLE OF THAT PRAIRIE A FAIRLY SAFE PLACE FOR A MAN TO BE PRIVATE SAID HE BUT BY THUNDER
7874-110243-0034 AND A MIGHTY POOR WOOING AT THAT WHERE HAD YOU ENGAGED A SEAT I WAS ON THAT HILL
7874-110243-0035 BUT HER BROTHER WAS WELL UP TO THE FRONT DID YOU SEE HIM COME OUT ON US YES I DID DID HE EVER STRIKE YOU AS BEING CRAZY THIS BROTHER OF HERS I CAN'T SAY THAT HE EVER DID I DARE SAY NOT
7874-110243-0036 I ALWAYS THOUGHT HIM SANE ENOUGH UNTIL TODAY BUT YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM ME THAT EITHER HE OR I OUGHT TO BE IN A STRAITJACKET WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME ANYHOW YOU'VE LIVED NEAR ME FOR SOME WEEKS WATSON TELL ME STRAIGHT NOW
7874-110243-0037 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WOULD PREVENT ME FROM MAKING A GOOD HUSBAND TO A WOMAN THAT I LOVED I SHOULD SAY NOT HE CAN'T OBJECT TO MY WORLDLY POSITION SO IT MUST BE MYSELF THAT HE HAS THIS DOWN ON WHAT HAS HE AGAINST ME
7874-110243-0038 I NEVER HURT MAN OR WOMAN IN MY LIFE THAT I KNOW OF AND YET HE WOULD NOT SO MUCH AS LET ME TOUCH THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS DID HE SAY SO THAT AND A DEAL MORE I TELL YOU WATSON I'VE ONLY KNOWN HER THESE FEW WEEKS
7874-110243-0039 BUT FROM THE FIRST I JUST FELT THAT SHE WAS MADE FOR ME AND SHE TOO SHE WAS HAPPY WHEN SHE WAS WITH ME AND THAT I'LL SWEAR THERE'S A LIGHT IN A WOMAN'S EYES THAT SPEAKS LOUDER THAN WORDS BUT HE HAS NEVER LET US GET TOGETHER
7874-110243-0040 AND IT WAS ONLY TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT I SAW A CHANCE OF HAVING A FEW WORDS WITH HER ALONE SHE WAS GLAD TO MEET ME BUT WHEN SHE DID IT WAS NOT LOVE THAT SHE WOULD TALK ABOUT AND SHE WOULDN'T HAVE LET ME TALK ABOUT IT EITHER IF SHE COULD HAVE STOPPED IT
7874-110243-0041 WITH THAT I OFFERED IN AS MANY WORDS TO MARRY HER
7874-110243-0042 IF HE HAD NOT BEEN HER BROTHER I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER HOW TO ANSWER HIM AS IT WAS I TOLD HIM THAT MY FEELINGS TOWARDS HIS SISTER WERE SUCH AS I WAS NOT ASHAMED OF AND THAT I HOPED THAT SHE MIGHT HONOUR ME BY BECOMING MY WIFE THAT SEEMED TO MAKE THE MATTER NO BETTER
7874-110243-0043 AND I ANSWERED HIM RATHER MORE HOTLY THAN I SHOULD PERHAPS CONSIDERING THAT SHE WAS STANDING BY SO IT ENDED BY HIS GOING OFF WITH HER AS YOU SAW
7874-110243-0044 AND I'LL OWE YOU MORE THAN EVER I CAN HOPE TO PAY I TRIED ONE OR TWO EXPLANATIONS BUT INDEED I WAS COMPLETELY PUZZLED MYSELF OUR FRIEND'S TITLE HIS FORTUNE HIS AGE HIS CHARACTER AND HIS APPEARANCE ARE ALL IN HIS FAVOUR AND I KNOW NOTHING AGAINST HIM
7874-110243-0045 HOWEVER OUR CONJECTURES WERE SET AT REST BY A VISIT FROM STAPLETON HIMSELF THAT VERY AFTERNOON HE HAD COME TO OFFER APOLOGIES FOR HIS RUDENESS OF THE MORNING AND AFTER A LONG PRIVATE INTERVIEW WITH SIR HENRY IN HIS STUDY THE UPSHOT OF THEIR CONVERSATION
7874-110243-0046 WAS THAT THE BREACH IS QUITE HEALED AND THAT WE ARE TO DINE AT MERRIPIT HOUSE NEXT FRIDAY AS A SIGN OF IT I DON'T SAY NOW THAT HE ISN'T A CRAZY MAN SAID SIR HENRY I CAN'T FORGET THE LOOK IN HIS EYES WHEN HE RAN AT ME THIS MORNING
7874-110243-0047 BUT I MUST ALLOW THAT NO MAN COULD MAKE A MORE HANDSOME APOLOGY THAN HE HAS DONE DID HE GIVE ANY EXPLANATION OF HIS CONDUCT HIS SISTER IS EVERYTHING IN HIS LIFE HE SAYS THAT IS NATURAL ENOUGH AND I AM GLAD THAT HE SHOULD UNDERSTAND HER VALUE
7874-110243-0048 BUT WHEN HE SAW WITH HIS OWN EYES THAT IT WAS REALLY SO AND THAT SHE MIGHT BE TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM IT GAVE HIM SUCH A SHOCK THAT FOR A TIME HE WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HE SAID OR DID
7874-110243-0049 AND HE RECOGNIZED HOW FOOLISH AND HOW SELFISH IT WAS
7874-110243-0050 IF SHE HAD TO LEAVE HIM HE HAD RATHER IT WAS TO A NEIGHBOUR LIKE MYSELF THAN TO ANYONE ELSE BUT IN ANY CASE IT WAS A BLOW TO HIM AND IT WOULD TAKE HIM SOME TIME BEFORE HE COULD PREPARE HIMSELF TO MEET IT HE WOULD WITHDRAW ALL OPPOSITION UPON HIS PART
7874-110243-0051 AND NOW I PASS ON TO ANOTHER THREAD WHICH I HAVE EXTRICATED OUT OF THE TANGLED SKEIN THE MYSTERY OF THE SOBS IN THE NIGHT OF THE TEAR STAINED FACE OF MISSUS BARRYMORE OF THE SECRET JOURNEY OF THE BUTLER TO THE WESTERN LATTICE WINDOW CONGRATULATE ME MY DEAR HOLMES
7874-110243-0052 AND TELL ME THAT I HAVE NOT DISAPPOINTED YOU AS AN AGENT
7874-110243-0053 ALL THESE THINGS HAVE BY ONE NIGHT'S WORK BEEN THOROUGHLY CLEARED I HAVE SAID BY ONE NIGHT'S WORK BUT IN TRUTH IT WAS BY TWO NIGHTS WORK FOR ON THE FIRST WE DREW ENTIRELY BLANK I SAT UP WITH SIR HENRY IN HIS ROOMS UNTIL NEARLY THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
7874-110243-0054 BUT NO SOUND OF ANY SORT DID WE HEAR EXCEPT THE CHIMING CLOCK UPON THE STAIRS IT WAS A MOST MELANCHOLY VIGIL AND ENDED BY EACH OF US FALLING ASLEEP IN OUR CHAIRS FORTUNATELY WE WERE NOT DISCOURAGED AND WE DETERMINED TO TRY AGAIN
7874-110243-0055 THE NEXT NIGHT WE LOWERED THE LAMP AND SAT SMOKING CIGARETTES WITHOUT MAKING THE LEAST SOUND IT WAS INCREDIBLE HOW SLOWLY THE HOURS CRAWLED BY AND YET WE WERE HELPED THROUGH IT BY THE SAME SORT OF PATIENT INTEREST WHICH THE HUNTER MUST FEEL AS HE WATCHES THE TRAP
7874-110243-0056 KEENLY ON THE ALERT ONCE MORE WE HAD HEARD THE CREAK OF A STEP IN THE PASSAGE VERY STEALTHILY WE HEARD IT PASS ALONG UNTIL IT DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE THEN THE BARONET GENTLY OPENED HIS DOOR AND WE SET OUT IN PURSUIT
7874-110243-0057 AND SHOT ONE SINGLE YELLOW BEAM ACROSS THE GLOOM OF THE CORRIDOR WE SHUFFLED CAUTIOUSLY TOWARDS IT TRYING EVERY PLANK BEFORE WE DARED TO PUT OUR WHOLE WEIGHT UPON IT WE HAD TAKEN THE PRECAUTION OF LEAVING OUR BOOTS BEHIND US BUT EVEN SO
7874-110243-0058 HOWEVER THE MAN IS FORTUNATELY RATHER DEAF AND HE WAS ENTIRELY PREOCCUPIED IN THAT WHICH HE WAS DOING WHEN AT LAST WE REACHED THE DOOR AND PEEPED THROUGH WE FOUND HIM CROUCHING AT THE WINDOW CANDLE IN HAND
7874-110243-0059 EXACTLY AS I HAD SEEN HIM TWO NIGHTS BEFORE WE HAD ARRANGED NO PLAN OF CAMPAIGN BUT THE BARONET IS A MAN TO WHOM THE MOST DIRECT WAY IS ALWAYS THE MOST NATURAL HE WALKED INTO THE ROOM AND AS HE DID SO BARRYMORE SPRANG UP FROM THE WINDOW
7874-110243-0060 WITH A SHARP HISS OF HIS BREATH AND STOOD LIVID AND TREMBLING BEFORE US HIS DARK EYES GLARING OUT OF THE WHITE MASK OF HIS FACE WERE FULL OF HORROR AND ASTONISHMENT AS HE GAZED FROM SIR HENRY TO ME WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE BARRYMORE
7874-110243-0061 HIS AGITATION WAS SO GREAT THAT HE COULD HARDLY SPEAK AND THE SHADOWS SPRANG UP AND DOWN FROM THE SHAKING OF HIS CANDLE IT WAS THE WINDOW SIR I GO ROUND AT NIGHT TO SEE THAT THEY ARE FASTENED ON THE SECOND FLOOR YES SIR ALL THE WINDOWS
7874-110243-0062 LOOK HERE BARRYMORE SAID SIR HENRY STERNLY WE HAVE MADE UP OUR MINDS TO HAVE THE TRUTH OUT OF YOU SO IT WILL SAVE YOU TROUBLE TO TELL IT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER COME NOW NO LIES WHAT WERE YOU DOING AT THAT WINDOW THE FELLOW LOOKED AT US IN A HELPLESS WAY
7874-110243-0063 I WAS DOING NO HARM SIR I WAS HOLDING A CANDLE TO THE WINDOW AND WHY WERE YOU HOLDING A CANDLE TO THE WINDOW DON'T ASK ME SIR HENRY DON'T ASK ME I GIVE YOU MY WORD SIR THAT IT IS NOT MY SECRET AND THAT I CANNOT TELL IT
7874-110243-0064 IF IT CONCERNED NO ONE BUT MYSELF I WOULD NOT TRY TO KEEP IT FROM YOU A SUDDEN IDEA OCCURRED TO ME AND I TOOK THE CANDLE FROM THE TREMBLING HAND OF THE BUTLER
7874-110243-0065 LET US SEE IF THERE IS ANY ANSWER I HELD IT AS HE HAD DONE AND STARED OUT INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT VAGUELY I COULD DISCERN THE BLACK BANK OF THE TREES
7874-110243-0066 NOTHING AT ALL THE BUTLER BROKE IN I ASSURE YOU SIR MOVE YOUR LIGHT ACROSS THE WINDOW WATSON CRIED THE BARONET SEE THE OTHER MOVES ALSO
7874-110243-0067 COME SPEAK UP WHO IS YOUR CONFEDERATE OUT YONDER AND WHAT IS THIS CONSPIRACY THAT IS GOING ON THE MAN'S FACE BECAME OPENLY DEFIANT IT IS MY BUSINESS AND NOT YOURS I WILL NOT TELL THEN YOU LEAVE MY EMPLOYMENT RIGHT AWAY
7874-110243-0068 VERY GOOD SIR IF I MUST I MUST AND YOU GO IN DISGRACE BY THUNDER YOU MAY WELL BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF YOUR FAMILY HAS LIVED WITH MINE FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS UNDER THIS ROOF
7874-110243-0069 NO NO SIR NO NOT AGAINST YOU IT WAS A WOMAN'S VOICE AND MISSUS BARRYMORE PALER AND MORE HORROR STRUCK THAN HER HUSBAND WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR HER BULKY FIGURE IN A SHAWL AND SKIRT MIGHT HAVE BEEN COMIC
7874-110243-0070 WERE IT NOT FOR THE INTENSITY OF FEELING UPON HER FACE WE HAVE TO GO ELIZA THIS IS THE END OF IT YOU CAN PACK OUR THINGS SAID THE BUTLER OH JOHN JOHN HAVE I BROUGHT YOU TO THIS IT IS MY DOING SIR HENRY ALL MINE
7874-110243-0071 HE HAS DONE NOTHING EXCEPT FOR MY SAKE AND BECAUSE I ASKED HIM SPEAK OUT THEN WHAT DOES IT MEAN
7874-110243-0072 WE CANNOT LET HIM PERISH AT OUR VERY GATES THE LIGHT IS A SIGNAL TO HIM THAT FOOD IS READY FOR HIM AND HIS LIGHT OUT YONDER IS TO SHOW THE SPOT TO WHICH TO BRING IT THEN YOUR BROTHER IS THE ESCAPED CONVICT SIR SELDEN THE CRIMINAL
7874-110243-0073 THAT'S THE TRUTH SIR SAID BARRYMORE I SAID THAT IT WAS NOT MY SECRET AND THAT I COULD NOT TELL IT TO YOU BUT NOW YOU HAVE HEARD IT AND YOU WILL SEE THAT IF THERE WAS A PLOT IT WAS NOT AGAINST YOU
7874-110243-0074 THIS THEN WAS THE EXPLANATION OF THE STEALTHY EXPEDITIONS AT NIGHT AND THE LIGHT AT THE WINDOW SIR HENRY AND I BOTH STARED AT THE WOMAN IN AMAZEMENT WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT THIS STOLIDLY RESPECTABLE PERSON
7874-110243-0075 WAS OF THE SAME BLOOD AS ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS CRIMINALS IN THE COUNTRY YES SIR MY NAME WAS SELDEN AND HE IS MY YOUNGER BROTHER WE HUMOURED HIM TOO MUCH WHEN HE WAS A LAD AND GAVE HIM HIS OWN WAY IN EVERYTHING
7874-110243-0076 FROM CRIME TO CRIME HE SANK LOWER AND LOWER UNTIL IT IS ONLY THE MERCY OF GOD WHICH HAS SNATCHED HIM FROM THE SCAFFOLD BUT TO ME SIR HE WAS ALWAYS THE LITTLE CURLY HEADED BOY THAT I HAD NURSED AND PLAYED WITH AS AN ELDER SISTER WOULD
7874-110243-0077 THAT WAS WHY HE BROKE PRISON SIR HE KNEW THAT I WAS HERE AND THAT WE COULD NOT REFUSE TO HELP HIM WHEN HE DRAGGED HIMSELF HERE ONE NIGHT WEARY AND STARVING WITH THE WARDERS HARD AT HIS HEELS WHAT COULD WE DO
7874-110243-0078 WE TOOK HIM IN AND FED HIM AND CARED FOR HIM THEN YOU RETURNED SIR AND MY BROTHER THOUGHT HE WOULD BE SAFER ON THE MOOR THAN ANYWHERE ELSE UNTIL THE HUE AND CRY WAS OVER SO HE LAY IN HIDING THERE BUT EVERY SECOND NIGHT WE MADE SURE
7874-110243-0079 AND IF THERE WAS AN ANSWER MY HUSBAND TOOK OUT SOME BREAD AND MEAT TO HIM EVERY DAY WE HOPED THAT HE WAS GONE BUT AS LONG AS HE WAS THERE WE COULD NOT DESERT HIM THAT IS THE WHOLE TRUTH AS I AM AN HONEST CHRISTIAN WOMAN AND YOU WILL SEE THAT IF THERE IS BLAME IN THE MATTER
7874-110243-0080 I CANNOT BLAME YOU FOR STANDING BY YOUR OWN WIFE FORGET WHAT I HAVE SAID
7874-110243-0081 AND WE SHALL TALK FURTHER ABOUT THIS MATTER IN THE MORNING WHEN THEY WERE GONE WE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AGAIN SIR HENRY HAD FLUNG IT OPEN AND THE COLD NIGHT WIND BEAT IN UPON OUR FACES
7874-110243-0082 AND HE IS WAITING THIS VILLAIN BESIDE THAT CANDLE BY THUNDER WATSON
7874-110243-0083 THE SAME THOUGHT HAD CROSSED MY OWN MIND IT WAS NOT AS IF THE BARRYMORES HAD TAKEN US INTO THEIR CONFIDENCE THEIR SECRET HAD BEEN FORCED FROM THEM THE MAN WAS A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY
7874-110243-0084 ANY NIGHT FOR EXAMPLE OUR NEIGHBOURS THE STAPLETONS MIGHT BE ATTACKED BY HIM AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE THOUGHT OF THIS WHICH MADE SIR HENRY SO KEEN UPON THE ADVENTURE I WILL COME SAID I THEN GET YOUR REVOLVER AND PUT ON YOUR BOOTS THE SOONER WE START THE BETTER
7874-110243-0085 AS THE FELLOW MAY PUT OUT HIS LIGHT AND BE OFF IN FIVE MINUTES WE WERE OUTSIDE THE DOOR STARTING UPON OUR EXPEDITION WE HURRIED THROUGH THE DARK SHRUBBERY
7874-110243-0086 THE NIGHT AIR WAS HEAVY WITH THE SMELL OF DAMP AND DECAY NOW AND AGAIN THE MOON PEEPED OUT FOR AN INSTANT BUT CLOUDS WERE DRIVING OVER THE FACE OF THE SKY
7874-110243-0087 THE LIGHT STILL BURNED STEADILY IN FRONT ARE YOU ARMED I ASKED I HAVE A HUNTING CROP WE MUST CLOSE IN ON HIM RAPIDLY FOR HE IS SAID TO BE A DESPERATE FELLOW WE SHALL TAKE HIM BY SURPRISE AND HAVE HIM AT OUR MERCY BEFORE HE CAN RESIST
7874-110243-0088 I SAY WATSON SAID THE BARONET WHAT WOULD HOLMES SAY TO THIS HOW ABOUT THAT HOUR OF DARKNESS IN WHICH THE POWER OF EVIL IS EXALTED AS IF IN ANSWER TO HIS WORDS THERE ROSE SUDDENLY OUT OF THE VAST GLOOM OF THE MOOR
7874-110243-0089 STRIDENT WILD AND MENACING THE BARONET CAUGHT MY SLEEVE AND HIS FACE GLIMMERED WHITE THROUGH THE DARKNESS MY GOD WHAT'S THAT WATSON I DON'T KNOW IT'S A SOUND THEY HAVE ON THE MOOR I HEARD IT ONCE BEFORE IT DIED AWAY
7874-110243-0090 AND AN ABSOLUTE SILENCE CLOSED IN UPON US WE STOOD STRAINING OUR EARS BUT NOTHING CAME WATSON SAID THE BARONET IT WAS THE CRY OF A HOUND MY BLOOD RAN COLD IN MY VEINS
7874-110243-0091 HE ASKED WHO THE FOLK ON THE COUNTRYSIDE OH THEY ARE IGNORANT PEOPLE WHY SHOULD YOU MIND WHAT THEY CALL IT TELL ME WATSON WHAT DO THEY SAY OF IT I HESITATED BUT COULD NOT ESCAPE THE QUESTION THEY SAY IT IS THE CRY OF THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES
7874-110243-0092 HE GROANED AND WAS SILENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS A HOUND IT WAS HE SAID AT LAST BUT IT SEEMED TO COME FROM MILES AWAY OVER YONDER I THINK IT WAS HARD TO SAY WHENCE IT CAME IT ROSE AND FELL WITH THE WIND
7874-110243-0093 ISN'T THAT THE DIRECTION OF THE GREAT GRIMPEN MIRE YES IT IS WELL IT WAS UP THERE COME NOW WATSON DIDN'T YOU THINK YOURSELF THAT IT WAS THE CRY OF A HOUND I AM NOT A CHILD YOU NEED NOT FEAR TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
7874-110243-0094 CALLING OF A STRANGE BIRD NO NO IT WAS A HOUND MY GOD CAN THERE BE SOME TRUTH IN ALL THESE STORIES
7874-110243-0095 YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT DO YOU WATSON NO NO AND YET IT WAS ONE THING TO LAUGH ABOUT IT IN LONDON
7874-110243-0096 IT WAS AS COLD AS A BLOCK OF MARBLE YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT TOMORROW I DON'T THINK I'LL GET THAT CRY OUT OF MY HEAD
7874-110243-0097 SHALL WE TURN BACK NO BY THUNDER WE HAVE COME OUT TO GET OUR MAN AND WE WILL DO IT WE AFTER THE CONVICT AND A HELL HOUND AS LIKELY AS NOT AFTER US COME ON WE'LL SEE IT THROUGH IF ALL THE FIENDS OF THE PIT WERE LOOSE UPON THE MOOR
7874-110243-0098 WE STUMBLED SLOWLY ALONG IN THE DARKNESS WITH THE BLACK LOOM OF THE CRAGGY HILLS AROUND US AND THE YELLOW SPECK OF LIGHT BURNING STEADILY IN FRONT THERE IS NOTHING SO DECEPTIVE AS THE DISTANCE OF A LIGHT UPON A PITCH DARK NIGHT
7874-110243-0099 AND THEN WE KNEW THAT WE WERE INDEED VERY CLOSE A GUTTERING CANDLE WAS STUCK IN A CREVICE OF THE ROCKS WHICH FLANKED IT ON EACH SIDE SO AS TO KEEP THE WIND FROM IT AND ALSO TO PREVENT IT FROM BEING VISIBLE SAVE IN THE DIRECTION OF BASKERVILLE HALL
7874-110243-0100 A BOULDER OF GRANITE CONCEALED OUR APPROACH AND CROUCHING BEHIND IT WE GAZED OVER IT AT THE SIGNAL LIGHT IT WAS STRANGE TO SEE THIS SINGLE CANDLE BURNING THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOOR WITH NO SIGN OF LIFE NEAR IT JUST THE ONE STRAIGHT YELLOW FLAME
7874-110243-0101 AND THE GLEAM OF THE ROCK ON EACH SIDE OF IT WHAT SHALL WE DO NOW WHISPERED SIR HENRY WAIT HERE HE MUST BE NEAR HIS LIGHT LET US SEE IF WE CAN GET A GLIMPSE OF HIM THE WORDS WERE HARDLY OUT OF MY MOUTH WHEN WE BOTH SAW HIM
7874-110243-0102 OVER THE ROCKS IN THE CREVICE OF WHICH THE CANDLE BURNED THERE WAS THRUST OUT AN EVIL YELLOW FACE A TERRIBLE ANIMAL FACE ALL SEAMED AND SCORED WITH VILE PASSIONS FOUL WITH MIRE WITH A BRISTLING BEARD AND HUNG WITH MATTED HAIR
7874-110243-0103 THE LIGHT BENEATH HIM WAS REFLECTED IN HIS SMALL CUNNING EYES WHICH PEERED FIERCELY
7874-110243-0104 OR THE FELLOW MAY HAVE HAD SOME OTHER REASON FOR THINKING THAT ALL WAS NOT WELL BUT I COULD READ HIS FEARS UPON HIS WICKED FACE ANY INSTANT HE MIGHT DASH OUT THE LIGHT AND VANISH IN THE DARKNESS I SPRANG FORWARD THEREFORE AND SIR HENRY DID THE SAME
7874-110243-0105 AT THE SAME MOMENT THE CONVICT SCREAMED OUT A CURSE AT US AND HURLED A ROCK WHICH SPLINTERED UP AGAINST THE BOULDER WHICH HAD SHELTERED US I CAUGHT ONE GLIMPSE OF HIS SHORT SQUAT STRONGLY BUILT FIGURE AS HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND TURNED TO RUN
7874-110243-0106 AT THE SAME MOMENT BY A LUCKY CHANCE THE MOON BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS WE RUSHED OVER THE BROW OF THE HILL AND THERE WAS OUR MAN RUNNING WITH GREAT SPEED DOWN THE OTHER SIDE SPRINGING OVER THE STONES IN HIS WAY WITH THE ACTIVITY OF A MOUNTAIN GOAT
7874-110243-0107 A LUCKY LONG SHOT OF MY REVOLVER MIGHT HAVE CRIPPLED HIM BUT I HAD BROUGHT IT ONLY TO DEFEND MYSELF IF ATTACKED AND NOT TO SHOOT AN UNARMED MAN WHO WAS RUNNING AWAY WE WERE BOTH SWIFT RUNNERS AND IN FAIRLY GOOD TRAINING
7874-110243-0108 BUT WE SOON FOUND THAT WE HAD NO CHANCE OF OVERTAKING HIM WE SAW HIM FOR A LONG TIME IN THE MOONLIGHT UNTIL HE WAS ONLY A SMALL SPECK MOVING SWIFTLY AMONG THE BOULDERS UPON THE SIDE OF A DISTANT HILL WE RAN AND RAN UNTIL WE WERE COMPLETELY BLOWN
7874-110243-0109 BUT THE SPACE BETWEEN US GREW EVER WIDER FINALLY WE STOPPED AND SAT PANTING ON TWO ROCKS WHILE WE WATCHED HIM DISAPPEARING IN THE DISTANCE AND IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT THERE OCCURRED A MOST STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED THING
7874-110243-0110 WE HAD RISEN FROM OUR ROCKS AND WERE TURNING TO GO HOME HAVING ABANDONED THE HOPELESS CHASE THE MOON WAS LOW UPON THE RIGHT AND THE JAGGED PINNACLE OF A GRANITE TOR STOOD UP AGAINST THE LOWER CURVE OF ITS SILVER DISC
7874-110243-0111 THERE OUTLINED AS BLACK AS AN EBONY STATUE ON THAT SHINING BACKGROUND I SAW THE FIGURE OF A MAN UPON THE TOR DO NOT THINK THAT IT WAS A DELUSION HOLMES I ASSURE YOU THAT I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE SEEN ANYTHING MORE CLEARLY
7874-110243-0112 AS FAR AS I COULD JUDGE THE FIGURE WAS THAT OF A TALL THIN MAN HE STOOD WITH HIS LEGS A LITTLE SEPARATED HIS ARMS FOLDED HIS HEAD BOWED AS IF HE WERE BROODING OVER THAT ENORMOUS WILDERNESS OF PEAT AND GRANITE WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM
7874-110243-0113 HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE VERY SPIRIT OF THAT TERRIBLE PLACE IT WAS NOT THE CONVICT THIS MAN WAS FAR FROM THE PLACE WHERE THE LATTER HAD DISAPPEARED BESIDES HE WAS A MUCH TALLER MAN WITH A CRY OF SURPRISE I POINTED HIM OUT TO THE BARONET
7874-110243-0114 BUT IN THE INSTANT DURING WHICH I HAD TURNED TO GRASP HIS ARM THE MAN WAS GONE THERE WAS THE SHARP PINNACLE OF GRANITE STILL CUTTING THE LOWER EDGE OF THE MOON BUT ITS PEAK BORE NO TRACE OF THAT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS FIGURE
