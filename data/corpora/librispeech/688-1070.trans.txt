688-1070-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR THE ODDS AND ENDS OF DOCTOR WALKER'S SENSATIONAL ESCAPE THAT NIGHT TO SOUTH AMERICA OF THE RECOVERY OF OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND SECURITIES IN THE SAFE FROM THE CHIMNEY ROOM
688-1070-0001 THE PAPERS HAVE KEPT THE PUBLIC WELL INFORMED OF MY SHARE IN DISCOVERING THE SECRET CHAMBER THEY HAVE BEEN SINGULARLY SILENT THE INNER HISTORY HAS NEVER BEEN TOLD MISTER JAMIESON GOT ALL KINDS OF CREDIT AND SOME OF IT HE DESERVED
688-1070-0002 AND BY NIGHT SHE WAS AT SUNNYSIDE UNDER GERTRUDE'S PARTICULAR CARE WHILE HER MOTHER HAD GONE TO BARBARA FITZHUGH'S WHAT HALSEY SAID TO MISSUS ARMSTRONG I NEVER KNEW BUT THAT HE WAS CONSIDERATE AND CHIVALROUS I FEEL CONFIDENT IT WAS HALSEY'S WAY ALWAYS WITH WOMEN
688-1070-0003 HE AND LOUISE HAD NO CONVERSATION TOGETHER UNTIL THAT NIGHT GERTRUDE AND ALEX I MEAN JACK HAD GONE FOR A WALK ALTHOUGH IT WAS NINE O'CLOCK AND ANYBODY BUT A PAIR OF YOUNG GEESE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT DEW WAS FALLING AND THAT IT IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO GET RID OF A SUMMER COLD
688-1070-0004 AT HALF AFTER NINE GROWING WEARY OF MY OWN COMPANY I WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO FIND THE YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE DOOR OF THE LIVING ROOM I PAUSED GERTRUDE AND JACK HAD RETURNED AND WERE THERE SITTING TOGETHER ON A DIVAN WITH ONLY ONE LAMP LIGHTED THEY DID NOT SEE OR HEAR ME
688-1070-0005 AND I BEAT A HASTY RETREAT TO THE LIBRARY BUT HERE AGAIN I WAS DRIVEN BACK LOUISE WAS SITTING IN A DEEP CHAIR LOOKING THE HAPPIEST I HAD EVER SEEN HER WITH HALSEY ON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR HOLDING HER CLOSE IT WAS NO PLACE FOR AN ELDERLY SPINSTER
688-1070-0006 I RETIRED TO MY UPSTAIRS SITTING ROOM AND GOT OUT ELIZA KLINEFELTER'S LAVENDER SLIPPERS AH WELL THE FOSTER MOTHERHOOD WOULD SOON HAVE TO BE PUT AWAY IN CAMPHOR AGAIN THE NEXT DAY BY DEGREES I GOT THE WHOLE STORY
688-1070-0007 PAUL ARMSTRONG HAD A BESETTING EVIL THE LOVE OF MONEY COMMON ENOUGH BUT HE LOVED MONEY NOT FOR WHAT IT WOULD BUY BUT FOR ITS OWN SAKE AN EXAMINATION OF THE BOOKS SHOWED NO IRREGULARITIES IN THE PAST YEAR SINCE JOHN HAD BEEN CASHIER
688-1070-0008 BUT BEFORE THAT IN THE TIME OF ANDERSON THE OLD CASHIER WHO HAD DIED MUCH STRANGE JUGGLING HAD BEEN DONE WITH THE RECORDS THE RAILROAD IN NEW MEXICO HAD APPARENTLY DRAINED THE BANKER'S PRIVATE FORTUNE AND HE DETERMINED TO RETRIEVE IT BY ONE STROKE
688-1070-0009 THIS WAS NOTHING LESS THAN THE LOOTING OF THE BANK'S SECURITIES TURNING THEM INTO MONEY AND MAKING HIS ESCAPE BUT THE LAW HAS LONG ARMS PAUL ARMSTRONG EVIDENTLY STUDIED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY JUST AS THE ONLY GOOD INDIAN IS A DEAD INDIAN
688-1070-0010 THE CONNIVANCE OF DOCTOR WALKER WAS SUGGESTED BY HIS LOVE FOR LOUISE THE MAN WAS UNSCRUPULOUS AND WITH THE GIRL AS A BAIT PAUL ARMSTRONG SOON HAD HIM FAST THE PLAN WAS APPARENTLY THE ACME OF SIMPLICITY A SMALL TOWN IN THE WEST
688-1070-0011 AN ATTACK OF HEART DISEASE A BODY FROM A MEDICAL COLLEGE DISSECTING ROOM SHIPPED IN A TRUNK TO DOCTOR WALKER BY A COLLEAGUE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND PALMED OFF FOR THE SUPPOSED DEAD BANKER WHAT WAS SIMPLER THE WOMAN NINA CARRINGTON WAS THE COG THAT SLIPPED
688-1070-0012 WHAT SHE ONLY SUSPECTED WHAT SHE REALLY KNEW WE NEVER LEARNED SHE WAS A CHAMBERMAID IN THE HOTEL AT C AND IT WAS EVIDENTLY HER INTENTION TO BLACKMAIL DOCTOR WALKER HIS POSITION AT THAT TIME WAS UNCOMFORTABLE
688-1070-0013 HE DENIED THE WHOLE THING AND SHE WENT TO HALSEY IT WAS THIS THAT HAD TAKEN HALSEY TO THE DOCTOR THE NIGHT HE DISAPPEARED HE ACCUSED THE DOCTOR OF THE DECEPTION AND CROSSING THE LAWN HAD SAID SOMETHING CRUEL TO LOUISE THEN FURIOUS AT HER APPARENT CONNIVANCE
688-1070-0014 HE HAD STARTED FOR THE STATION DOCTOR WALKER AND PAUL ARMSTRONG THE LATTER STILL LAME WHERE I HAD SHOT HIM HURRIED ACROSS TO THE EMBANKMENT CERTAIN ONLY OF ONE THING HALSEY MUST NOT TELL THE DETECTIVE WHAT HE SUSPECTED
688-1070-0015 UNTIL THE MONEY HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE CHIMNEY ROOM THEY STEPPED INTO THE ROAD IN FRONT OF THE CAR TO STOP IT AND FATE PLAYED INTO THEIR HANDS THE CAR STRUCK THE TRAIN AND THEY HAD ONLY TO DISPOSE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS FIGURE IN THE ROAD THIS THEY DID AS I HAVE TOLD
688-1070-0016 SUNNYSIDE WITH ITS HOARD IN THE CHIMNEY ROOM HAD BEEN RENTED WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE ATTEMPTS TO DISLODGE ME HAVING FAILED HE WAS DRIVEN TO BREAKING INTO HIS OWN HOUSE THE LADDER IN THE CHUTE THE BURNING OF THE STABLE AND THE ENTRANCE THROUGH THE CARD ROOM WINDOW
688-1070-0017 ALL WERE IN THE COURSE OF A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO GET INTO THE CHIMNEY ROOM LOUISE AND HER MOTHER HAD FROM THE FIRST BEEN THE GREAT STUMBLING BLOCKS THE PLAN HAD BEEN TO SEND LOUISE AWAY UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE FOR HER TO INTERFERE BUT SHE CAME BACK TO THE HOTEL AT C
688-1070-0018 JUST AT THE WRONG TIME THERE WAS A TERRIBLE SCENE THE GIRL WAS TOLD THAT SOMETHING OF THE KIND WAS NECESSARY THAT THE BANK WAS ABOUT TO CLOSE AND HER STEPFATHER WOULD EITHER AVOID ARREST AND DISGRACE IN THIS WAY OR KILL HIMSELF FANNY ARMSTRONG WAS A WEAKLING
688-1070-0019 SHE HAD NO LOVE FOR HER STEPFATHER BUT HER DEVOTION TO HER MOTHER WAS ENTIRE SELF SACRIFICING FORCED INTO ACQUIESCENCE BY HER MOTHER'S APPEALS OVERWHELMED BY THE SITUATION THE GIRL CONSENTED AND FLED
688-1070-0020 HAD SENT THE CASHIER TO THE BANK THAT NIGHT IN A FRENZY LOUISE ARRIVED AT SUNNYSIDE AND FOUND THE HOUSE RENTED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO SHE SENT FOR ARNOLD AT THE GREENWOOD CLUB AND TOLD HIM A LITTLE NOT ALL
688-1070-0021 SHE TOLD HIM THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG AND THAT THE BANK WAS ABOUT TO CLOSE THAT HIS FATHER WAS RESPONSIBLE OF THE CONSPIRACY SHE SAID NOTHING TO HER SURPRISE ARNOLD ALREADY KNEW THROUGH BAILEY THAT NIGHT THAT THINGS WERE NOT RIGHT
688-1070-0022 MOREOVER HE SUSPECTED WHAT LOUISE DID NOT THAT THE MONEY WAS HIDDEN AT SUNNYSIDE HE HAD A SCRAP OF PAPER THAT INDICATED A CONCEALED ROOM SOMEWHERE HIS INHERITED CUPIDITY WAS AROUSED EAGER TO GET HALSEY AND JACK BAILEY OUT OF THE HOUSE
688-1070-0023 HE WENT UP TO THE EAST ENTRY AND IN THE BILLIARD ROOM GAVE THE CASHIER WHAT HE HAD REFUSED EARLIER IN THE EVENING THE ADDRESS OF PAUL ARMSTRONG IN CALIFORNIA AND A TELEGRAM WHICH HAD BEEN FORWARDED TO THE CLUB FOR BAILEY FROM DOCTOR WALKER
688-1070-0024 IT WAS IN RESPONSE TO ONE BAILEY HAD SENT AND IT SAID THAT PAUL ARMSTRONG WAS VERY ILL BAILEY WAS ALMOST DESPERATE HE DECIDED TO GO WEST AND FIND PAUL ARMSTRONG AND TO FORCE HIM TO DISGORGE
688-1070-0025 BUT THE CATASTROPHE AT THE BANK OCCURRED SOONER THAN HE HAD EXPECTED ON THE MOMENT OF STARTING WEST AT ANDREWS STATION WHERE MISTER JAMIESON HAD LOCATED THE CAR HE READ THAT THE BANK HAD CLOSED AND GOING BACK SURRENDERED HIMSELF
688-1070-0026 JOHN BAILEY HAD KNOWN PAUL ARMSTRONG INTIMATELY HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE MONEY WAS GONE IN FACT IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE IN THE INTERVAL SINCE THE SECURITIES HAD BEEN TAKEN WHERE WAS IT
688-1070-0027 BAILEY FELT SURE THERE WAS A HIDDEN ROOM AT SUNNYSIDE HE TRIED TO SEE THE ARCHITECT OF THE BUILDING BUT LIKE THE CONTRACTOR
688-1070-0028 IT WAS HALSEY'S IDEA THAT JOHN BAILEY COME TO THE HOUSE AS A GARDENER AND PURSUE HIS INVESTIGATIONS AS HE COULD HIS SMOOTH UPPER LIP HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT DISGUISE WITH HIS CHANGE OF CLOTHES AND A HAIR CUT BY A COUNTRY BARBER
688-1070-0029 SO IT WAS ALEX JACK BAILEY WHO HAD BEEN OUR GHOST NOT ONLY HAD HE ALARMED LOUISE AND HIMSELF HE ADMITTED ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE BUT HE HAD DUG THE HOLE IN THE TRUNK ROOM WALL AND LATER SENT ELIZA INTO HYSTERIA
688-1070-0030 THE NOTE LIDDY HAD FOUND IN GERTRUDE'S SCRAP BASKET WAS FROM HIM AND IT WAS HE WHO HAD STARTLED ME INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS BY THE CLOTHES CHUTE AND WITH GERTRUDE'S HELP HAD CARRIED ME TO LOUISE'S ROOM GERTRUDE I LEARNED HAD WATCHED ALL NIGHT BESIDE ME
688-1070-0031 IN AN EXTREMITY OF ANXIETY ABOUT ME THAT OLD THOMAS HAD SEEN HIS MASTER AND THOUGHT HE HAD SEEN THE SUNNYSIDE GHOST THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT
688-1070-0032 THE NIGHT LIDDY AND I HEARD THE NOISE ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE THAT TOO WAS RIGHT ON THE NIGHT BEFORE ARNOLD ARMSTRONG WAS MURDERED JACK BAILEY HAD MADE HIS FIRST ATTEMPT TO SEARCH FOR THE SECRET ROOM
688-1070-0033 AND HE TOOK THE OWL TRAIN TO TOWN THE ODDEST THING TO ME WAS THAT MISTER JAMIESON HAD KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THAT ALEX WAS JACK BAILEY BUT THE FACE OF THE PSEUDO GARDENER WAS VERY QUEER INDEED WHEN THAT NIGHT IN THE CARD ROOM THE DETECTIVE TURNED TO HIM AND SAID
688-1070-0034 SUNNYSIDE IS FOR SALE NO I SHALL NOT BUY IT LITTLE LUCIEN ARMSTRONG IS LIVING WITH HIS STEP GRANDMOTHER AND SHE IS RECOVERING GRADUALLY FROM TROUBLES THAT HAD EXTENDED OVER THE ENTIRE PERIOD OF HER SECOND MARRIAGE
688-1070-0035 ANNE WATSON LIES NOT FAR FROM THE MAN SHE KILLED AND WHO AS SURELY CAUSED HER DEATH THOMAS THE FOURTH VICTIM OF THE CONSPIRACY IS BURIED ON THE HILL WITH NINA CARRINGTON FIVE LIVES WERE SACRIFICED IN THE COURSE OF THIS GRIM CONSPIRACY
688-1070-0036 THERE WILL BE TWO WEDDINGS BEFORE LONG AND LIDDY HAS ASKED FOR MY HELIOTROPE POPLIN TO WEAR TO THE CHURCH I KNEW SHE WOULD SHE HAS WANTED IT FOR THREE YEARS AND SHE WAS QUITE UGLY THE TIME I SPILLED COFFEE ON IT WE ARE VERY QUIET JUST THE TWO OF US
688-1070-0037 WHEN WARNER MARRIED ROSIE LIDDY SNIFFED AND SAID WHAT I TOOK FOR FAITHFULNESS IN ROSIE HAD BEEN NOTHING BUT MAWKISHNESS I HAVE NOT YET OUTLIVED LIDDY'S CONTEMPT BECAUSE I GAVE THEM SILVER KNIVES AND FORKS AS A WEDDING GIFT
688-1070-0038 SO WE SIT AND TALK AND SOMETIMES LIDDY THREATENS TO LEAVE AND OFTEN I DISCHARGE HER BUT WE STAY TOGETHER SOMEHOW I AM TALKING OF RENTING A HOUSE NEXT YEAR AND LIDDY SAYS TO BE SURE THERE IS NO GHOST
