830-130727-0000 IN THE HEART OF ITALY WHAT A RELIEF IT IS SOMETIMES TO HAVE A GOOD WAITER SAY YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU WANT WILL YOU LET ME BRING YOU THE BEST THERE IS IN THE HOUSE SOMETIMES YOU KNOW YOU REALLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU WANT
830-130727-0001 AND USUALLY WHEN THAT IS THE CASE YOU ARE NOT VERY HUNGRY THAT IS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME TO TRY NEW THINGS IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU WANT BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO ORDER IN EITHER INSTANCE OUR ADVICE IS IF THE WAITER GETS CONFIDENTIAL AND OFFERS HIS ASSISTANCE
830-130727-0002 YOU WILL CERTAINLY MISS SOMETHING IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT HIS GOOD OFFICES THIS WAS THE CASE WITH US ONE DAY WHEN WE WERE OVER AT FIFTEEN FORTY NINE STOCKTON STREET NEAR WASHINGTON SQUARE AT THE GIANDUJA THE PROPER PRONUNCIATION OF THIS
830-130727-0003 THIS IS ONE OF THE GOOD ITALIAN RESTAURANTS OF THE LATIN QUARTER
830-130727-0004 GOOD COOKING AND EXCELLENT SERVICE IT MATTERS NOT WHETHER YOU TAKE THEIR THIRTY FIVE CENT LUNCHEON OR ORDER A MOST ELABORATE MEAL YOU WILL FIND THAT THE SERVICE IS JUST WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE WE ASKED BRENTI WHAT HE CONSIDERED HIS MOST FAMOUS DISH
830-130727-0005 AND LIKE ALL OTHER PROPRIETORS HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAID WITH HANDS EMPHASIZING HIS WORDS WE HAVE SO MANY FINE DISHES OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT
830-130727-0006 THERE IS NO ONE THE VERY BEST I COULD GIVE YOU TWO LET IT BE TWO THEN WAS OUR IMMEDIATE REJOINDER AND HERE IS WHAT HE GAVE US AS THE BEST RECIPES OF THE GIANDUJA
830-130727-0007 FIRST LET US GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE DIFFICULTY UNDER WHICH WE SECURED THESE RECIPES BY PRINTING THEM JUST AS HE WROTE THEM DOWN FOR US AND THEN WE SHALL ELABORATE A LITTLE AND SHOW THE RESULT OF SKILLFUL QUESTIONING THIS IS THE WAY HE WROTE THE RECIPE FOR RISOTTO MILANAISE
830-130727-0008 RISOTTO ALA MILANAISE ONIONS CHOP FINE MARROW AND LITTLE BUTTER RICE SAFFRON CHICKEN BROTH WEN COOK ADD FRESH BUTTER AND PARMESAN CHEESE SEASONED
830-130727-0009 WHAT WAS EMBODIED IN THE WORDS WEN COOK WAS THE ESSENTIAL OF THE RECIPE AND HERE IS THE WAY WE GOT IT CHOP ONE LARGE ONION FINE CUT A BEEF MARROW INTO SMALL DICE AND STIR IT WITH THE CHOPPED ONION PUT A SMALL PIECE OF BUTTER IN A FRYING PAN
830-130727-0010 AND INTO THIS PUT THE ONION AND MARROW AND FRY TO A DELICATE BROWN NOW ADD ONE SCANT CUP OF RICE STIRRING CONSTANTLY AND INTO THIS PUT A PINCH OF SAFFRON THAT HAS BEEN BRUISED WHEN THE RICE TAKES ON A BROWN COLOR ADD SLOWLY
830-130727-0011 CHICKEN BROTH AS NEEDED UNTIL THE RICE IS THOROUGHLY COOKED THEN ADD A LUMP OF FRESH BUTTER ABOUT THE SIZE OF A WALNUT AND SPRINKLE LIBERALLY WITH GRATED PARMESAN CHEESE SEASONING TO TASTE WITH PEPPER AND SALT THIS IS TO BE SERVED WITH CHICKEN OR VEAL
830-130727-0012 THE SECOND RECIPE WAS FOR FRITTO MISTO AND HE WROTE IT AS FOLLOWS FRITTO MISTO LAMB CHOPS AND BRAINS BREADED SWEETBREADS ESCALLOP OF VEAL FRESH MUSHROOMS
830-130727-0013 ITALIAN SQUASH WHEN IN SEASON ASPARAGUS OR CAULIFLOWER FRIED IN FRESH BUTTER DIPPED IN BEATEN EGGS LIME JUS FRITTO MISTO MEANS FRIED MIXTURE AND THE RECIPE AS WE FINALLY ELUCIDATED IT
830-130727-0014 IS AS FOLLOWS TAKE A LAMB CHOP A PIECE OF CALF BRAIN ONE SWEETBREAD A SLICE OF VEAL A FRESH MUSHROOM SLICED ITALIAN SQUASH A PIECE OF ASPARAGUS OR OF CAULIFLOWER AND DIP THESE INTO A BATTER MADE OF AN EGG
830-130727-0015 WELL BEATEN WITH A LITTLE FLOUR SPRINKLE THESE WITH A LITTLE LIME JUICE AND FRY TO A DELICATE BROWN IN BUTTER ADDING SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTE AT THE GIANDUJA AS AT ALL OTHER ITALIAN RESTAURANTS NOT MUCH AFFECTED BY AMERICANS
830-130727-0016 YOU WILL FIND AN ATMOSPHERE OF UNCONVENTIONALITY THAT IS DELIGHTFUL TO THE BOHEMIAN THERE IS NO IRKSOME ESPIONAGE ON THE PART OF OTHER PATRONS ALL OF WHOM ARE THERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTENDING STRICTLY TO THEIR OWN BUSINESS
830-130727-0017 AND THE AFFAIRS OF OTHER DINERS ARE OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO THEM THERE IS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND UNCONSCIOUSNESS MOST PLEASING AFTER HAVING EXPERIENCED THOSE OTHER RESTAURANTS WHERE IT SEEMS TO BE THE BUSINESS OF ALL THE REST OF THE GUESTS TO KNOW JUST WHAT YOU ARE EATING AND DRINKING
830-130727-0018 THERE IS LITTLE OF THE OBNOXIOUS POSING THAT ONE FINDS IN RESTAURANTS OF THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICTS FOR WHILE ITALIANS IN COMMON WITH ALL OTHER LATINS ARE NATURAL BORN POSEURS THEY ARE NOT OFFENSIVE IN IT BUT RATHER IMPRESS YOU WITH THE SAME FEELING AS THE ANTICS OF A CHILD
830-130727-0019 ONE OF THE LITTLE OUT OF THE WAY RESTAURANTS OF THE ITALIAN QUARTER IS THE LEON D'ORO AT FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE GRANT AVENUE AND IT IS ONE OF THE SURPRISES OF THAT DISTRICT LAZZARINI HE WITH THE BIG VOICE
830-130727-0020 PRESIDES OVER THE TINY KITCHEN IN THE REAR OF THE ROOM DEVOTED TO PUBLIC SERVICE AND FAMILY AFFAIRS SOFT VOICED RITA WITH HER DEMURE AIR AND HER RESEMBLANCE TO EVANGELINE WITH HER CROSSED APRON STRINGS AND DELICATE FEATURES TAKES YOUR ORDER
830-130727-0021 AND SOON COMES THE BOOMING SOUND FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE RANGE THAT ANNOUNCES TO ALL PATRONS AS WELL AS TO SOME WHO MAY BE IN THE VICINITY ON THE STREET THAT YOUR ORDER IS READY AND THEN EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT YOU ARE EATING
830-130727-0022 AS YOU SIT EITHER IN CURTAINED ALCOVE OR AT THE COMMON TABLE IN THE MAIN ROOM LITTLE ANDREA WILL VISIT YOU WITH HIS CAT BOTH ARE INSTITUTIONS OF THE PLACE AND ONE IS PRONE TO WONDER HOW A CAT CAN HAVE SO MUCH PATIENCE WITH A LITTLE BOY
830-130727-0023 ANDREA SPEAKS ITALIAN SO FLUENTLY AND SO RAPIDLY THAT IT GIVES YOU THE IMPRESSION OF A QUICK RUSHING STREAM OF PURE WATER TUMBLING OVER THE STONES OF A STEEP DECLIVITY HE IS NOT YET OLD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT EVERYBODY WHO KNOWS HOW TO SPEAK ITALIAN
830-130727-0024 FOR HE TALKS WITHOUT EVER EXPECTING AN ANSWER LAZZARINI UNDERSTANDS THE ART AND SCIENCE OF COOKING AND SOME OF THE DISHES HE PREPARES ARE SO UNUSUAL THAT ONE GOES AGAIN AND AGAIN TO PARTAKE OF THEM POSSIBLY HIS BEST DISH IS THE FOLLOWING
830-130727-0025 CHICKEN A LA LEON D'ORO CUT A SPRING CHICKEN INTO PIECES PLACE THESE IN A PAN CONTAINING HOT OLIVE OIL AND SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER TURN THE CHICKEN UNTIL IT IS THOROUGHLY BROWNED
830-130727-0026 AND ADD FINELY CHOPPED GREEN PEPPERS LET IT COOK AWHILE THEN ADD A FINELY CHOPPED CLOVE OF GARLIC AND A LITTLE SAGE PUT IN A SMALL GLASS OF MARSALA WINE TOMATO SAUCE
830-130727-0027 BEFORE TAKING FROM THE PAN ADD HALF A TABLESPOONFUL OF BUTTER AND SERVE ON A HOT PLATE LAZZARINI ALSO MAKES A SPECIALTY OF SNAILS AND THEY ARE WELL WORTH TRYING WHILE YOU ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE UNUSUAL THINGS TO EAT
830-130727-0028 THE RECIPE FOR THESE IS AS FOLLOWS SNAILS A LA BORDELAISE PUT TEN POUNDS OF SNAILS IN A COVERED BARREL AND KEEP FOR TEN DAYS THEN PUT IN A TUB WITH A HANDFUL OF SALT AND A QUARTER OF A GALLON OF VINEGAR
830-130727-0029 STIR FOR TWENTY MINUTES UNTIL A FOAM RISES THEN TAKE OUT AND WASH THOROUGHLY UNTIL THE WATER RUNS CLEAR PUT IN A LARGE POT A PINT OF VIRGIN OLIVE OIL FOUR LARGE ONIONS AND EIGHT CLOVES OF GARLIC ALL CHOPPED FINE
830-130727-0030 AND A SMALL BUNCH OF PARSLEY CHOPPED FINE PUT THE POT OVER THE FIRE AND WHEN THE ONIONS ARE BROWNED STIR IN SOME WHITE WINE OR MARSALA AND THEN PUT IN THE SNAILS COVER AND LET SIMMER FOR THIRTY FIVE MINUTES
830-130727-0031 WHILE COOKING ADD A PINT OF MEAT STOCK A LITTLE BUTTER AND SOME ANISE SEED WHEN DONE PUT IN A SOUP TUREEN AND SERVE TO REMOVE THE SNAILS USE SMALL WOODEN TOOTHPICKS A BREATH OF THE ORIENT
830-130727-0032 SAN FRANCISCO'S WORLD FAMED CHINATOWN LIKE THE REST OF THE CITY IS CHANGED SINCE THE BIG FIRE AND THE CHINATOWN OF TODAY IS BUT A REMINISCENCE OF THE OLD ORIENTAL CITY THAT WAS SET IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST THRIVING OCCIDENTAL METROPOLIS
830-130727-0033 THE CITY THAT WAS THERE HAS NEVER BEEN MUCH OF CHINATOWN THAT SAVORED OF BOHEMIANISM BUT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE VOGUE FOR VISITORS TO MAKE A TRIP THROUGH ITS MYSTERIOUS ALLEYS PEERING INTO THE FEARSOME DARK DOORWAYS LISTENING TO THE OMINOUS SLAMMING DOORS OF THE CLUBS
830-130727-0034 AND SHUDDERING IN A DELIGHTFUL HORROR AT THE RECUMBENT OPIUM SMOKERS POINTED OUT TO THEM BY THE INDUSTRIOUS GUIDE AND WHEN THEY WERE TAKEN INTO ONE OF THE GAMBLING HOUSES AND SHOWN THE DOUBLE DOORS
830-130727-0035 AND THE MANY CONTRIVANCES USED TO PREVENT POLICE INTERFERENCE WITH THE INNOCENT GAMES OF FAN TAN AND THEN WERE SHOWN THE SECRET UNDERGROUND PASSAGE LEADING FROM ONE OF THE GAMBLING HOUSES TO THE STAGE OF THE GREAT CHINESE THEATRE TWO BLOCKS AWAY THEY WENT HOME READY TO BELIEVE ANYTHING TOLD THEM ABOUT
830-130727-0036 THE WAYS THAT ARE DARK AND TRICKS THAT ARE VAIN FOR THEY WERE SURE THE HEATHEN CHINEE WAS PECULIAR CHINESE RESTAURANT LIFE NEVER APPEALED TO BOHEMIANS AND WHEN IT BECAME NECESSARY TO ENTERTAIN VISITORS WITH A TRIP TO A CHINATOWN RESTAURANT
830-130727-0037 THE ORDINARY SERVICE WAS OF TEA AND RICE CAKES SERVED FROM LACQUERED TRAYS IN GAUDY ROOMS AND THE ADMIRING VISITORS COULD WELL IMAGINE THEMSELVES IN FAR OFF CATHAY THEN CAME THE FIRE AND CHINATOWN WITH THE REST OF THE DOWN TOWN PORTION OF SAN FRANCISCO
830-130727-0038 PASSED AWAY IN THE REBUILDING THE OWNERS OF THE PROPERTIES CONCLUDED TO GIVE THE QUARTER A MORE CHINESE ASPECT AND PAGODA LIKE STRUCTURES ARE NOW TO BE FOUND IN ALL PARTS OF THE SECTION THE CURIOSITY OF THE TOURIST IS AN AVAILABLE ASSET TO CHINATOWN
830-130727-0039 AND WITH QUEER HOUSES AND QUEERER ARTICLES ON SALE THERE IS ALWAYS PLENTY OF UNINITIATED TO KEEP THE GUIDES BUSY BUT FROM A CITY OF MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ORIENTALS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENLIGHTENED CITY AN ASIATIC CITY THAT HAD ITS OWN LAWS AND EXECUTED ITS CRIMINALS
830-130727-0040 WITH THE MOST UTTER DISREGARD FOR AMERICAN LAWS IT HAS CHANGED INTO ONE OF THE MOST LAW ABIDING PARTS OF THE GREAT CITY WITH THE PASSING OF THE QUEUE CAME THE ADOPTION OF THE AMERICAN STYLE OF DRESSING AND MUCH OF THE PICTURESQUENESS
830-130727-0041 OF THE OLD CHINATOWN HAS DISAPPEARED BUT WITH THE CHANGED CONDITIONS THERE HAS COME A CHANGE IN THE RESTAURANT LIFE OF THE QUARTER AND NOW A NUMBER OF PLACES HAVE BEEN OPENED TO CATER TO AMERICANS AND ON EVERY HAND ONE SEES CHOP SUEY SIGNS AND CHINESE NOODLES
830-130727-0042 IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT ONE SELDOM SEES A CHINAMAN EATING IN THE RESTAURANTS THAT ARE MOST ATTRACTIVE TO AMERICANS SOME SERVE BOTH WHITE AND YELLOW AND OTHERS SERVE BUT THE CHINESE AND A FEW FAVORED WHITE FRIENDS PROBABLY THE BEST RESTAURANT IN CHINATOWN
830-130727-0043 HERE IS SERVED SUCH A VARIETY OF STRANGE DISHES THAT ONE HAS TO BE A BRAVE BOHEMIAN INDEED TO PARTAKE WITHOUT QUESTION ORDINARILY WHEN CHINESE RESTAURANTS ARE MENTIONED BUT TWO DISHES ARE THOUGHT OF CHOP SUEY AND CHOW MAIN
830-130727-0044 BUT NEITHER IS CONSIDERED AMONG THE FINE DISHES SERVED TO CHINESE EPICURES IT IS MUCH AS IF ONE OF OUR BEST RESTAURANTS WERE TO ADVERTISE HASH AS ITS SPECIALTY BOTH THESE DISHES MIGHT BE TERMED GLORIFIED HASH
830-130727-0045 THE INGREDIENTS ARE SO NUMEROUS AND SO VARIED WITH OCCASION THAT ONE IS TEMPTED TO IMAGINE THEM MADE OF THE TABLE LEAVINGS AND THAT IS NOT AT ALL PLEASANT TO CONTEMPLATE
830-130727-0046 WE ASKED ONE OF THE MANAGERS AT THE HANG FAR LOW WHAT HE WOULD ORDER IF HE WISHED TO GET THE BEST DISH PREPARED IN THE RESTAURANT AND HE WAS EVEN MORE EMPHATIC IN HIS SHRUGS THAN THE FRENCH OR ITALIAN MANAGERS
830-130727-0047 HE PROTESTED THAT THERE WERE SO MANY GOOD THINGS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO NAME JUST ONE AS BEING THE BEST YOU SEE WE HAVE FISH FINS THEY ARE VERY GOOD SNAILS CHINA STYLE VERY GOOD TOO THEN WE HAVE TURTLE
830-130727-0048 BROUGHT FROM CHINA DIFFERENT FROM THE TURTLE THEY HAVE HERE AND WE COOK IT CHINA STYLE EELS COME FROM CHINA AND THEY ARE COOKED CHINA STYLE TOO WHAT IS CHINA STYLE
830-130727-0049 WE HAVE HERE THE VERY BEST TEA THIS MAY BE TAKEN AS A SAMPLE OF WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN VISITING CHINATOWN'S RESTAURANTS AND WHILE WE CONFESS TO HAVING SOME EXCELLENT DISHES SERVED US IN CHINATOWN OUR PREFERENCE LIES IN OTHER PATHS OF ENDEAVOR
830-130727-0050 WE SUPPOSE IT IS ALL IN THE POINT OF VIEW AND OUR POINT OF VIEW IS THAT THERE IS NOTHING EXCEPT SUPERFICIALITY IN THE ORDINARY CHINESE RESTAURANTS FREQUENTED BY AMERICANS
