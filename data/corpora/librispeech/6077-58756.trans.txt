6077-58756-0000 AIR TEMPERATURE THE MOST RECENT DEFINITION OF HEAT IS THAT IT IS A MODE OF MOTION NOT MOVEMENT OF A MASS OF SUBSTANCE
6077-58756-0001 THAT THE ABILITY OF ANY SUBSTANCE TO ABSORB HEAT DEPENDS UPON THE NUMBER OF ATOMS IT CONTAINS
6077-58756-0002 WEIGHS FIFTEEN POUNDS THE DENSITY OF THE AIR DECREASES AS WE ASCEND EACH SUCCESSIVE LAYER AS WE ASCEND IS MORE AND MORE EXPANDED AND CONSEQUENTLY HAS A LESS AND LESS NUMBER OF AIR MOLECULES IN A GIVEN SPACE
6077-58756-0003 THEREFORE THE CAPACITY OF THE AIR FOR HOLDING HEAT DECREASES AS WE GO HIGHER WE DEDUCE FROM THESE FACTS THAT THE HIGHER WE GO THE COLDER IT BECOMES AND THIS WE FIND TO BE THE CASE WHOEVER HAS ASCENDED A HIGH MOUNTAIN
6077-58756-0004 TO TAKE ENOUGH OF OXYGEN INTO OUR LUNGS TO CARRY ON THE NATURAL OPERATIONS OF THE BODILY FUNCTIONS TO OVERCOME THIS DIFFICULTY IF WE REMAIN AT THIS ALTITUDE FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME WE SHALL FIND THAT OUR LUNGS HAVE EXPANDED SO AS TO MAKE UP IN QUANTITY WHAT IS LACKING IN QUALITY
6077-58756-0005 HE WILL FIND THAT HIS LUNGS ARE SO EXPANDED
6077-58756-0006 WITH ONE WHOSE LUNGS ARE ADAPTED TO THE CONDITIONS WE FIND AT SEA LEVEL WHEN HE ASCENDS TO A HIGHER ALTITUDE THERE IS A CONSTANT ENDEAVOR ON THE PART OF NATURE TO ADAPT BOTH ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE LIFE TO THE SURROUNDINGS WHILE NO EXACT FORMULA
6077-58756-0007 THE TEMPERATURE WILL BE MORE OR LESS AFFECTED BY LOCAL CONDITIONS IF WE GO UP IN A BALLOON WE HAVE TO DEPEND UPON THE BAROMETER AS A MEANS OF MEASURING ALTITUDE WHICH
6077-58756-0008 IT IS EASILY UNDERSTOOD THAT A CUBIC FOOT OF AIR AT SEA LEVEL WILL CONTAIN A GREAT MANY MORE ATOMS THAN A CUBIC FOOT OF AIR WILL AT THE TOP OF A HIGH MOUNTAIN OR TO STATE IT IN ANOTHER WAY A CUBIC FOOT OF AIR AT SEA LEVEL
6077-58756-0009 SUPPOSE THEN THAT THE AMOUNT OF HEAT HELD IN A CUBIC FOOT OF AIR AT SEA LEVEL REMAINED THE SAME AS RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF ATOMS IN ITS ASCENT WE SHALL FIND THAT AT A HIGH ALTITUDE THE SAME NUMBER OF ATOMS THAT WERE HELD AT SEA LEVEL
6077-58756-0010 IN A CUBIC FOOT HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED OVER A SO MUCH LARGER SPACE THAT THE SENSIBLE HEAT IS GREATLY DIMINISHED OR DILUTED SO TO SPEAK IT WAS AN OLD NOTION THAT HEAT WOULD HIDE ITSELF AWAY IN FLUIDS UNDER A NAME CALLED BY SCIENTISTS LATENT HEAT
6077-58756-0011 THIS THEORY HAS BEEN EXPLODED HOWEVER BY MODERN INVESTIGATION IF WE PLACE SOME SUBSTANCE THAT WILL INFLAME AT A LOW TEMPERATURE IN THE BOTTOM OF WHAT IS CALLED A FIRE SYRINGE WHICH IS NOTHING BUT A CYLINDER BORED OUT SMOOTHLY WITH A PISTON HEAD NICELY FITTED TO IT
6077-58756-0012 SO THAT IT WILL BE AIR TIGHT AND THEN SUDDENLY CONDENSE THE AIR IN THE SYRINGE BY SHOVING THE PLUNGER TO THE BOTTOM WE CAN INFLAME THE SUBSTANCE WHICH HAS BEEN PLACED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CYLINDER IN THIS OPERATION THE HEAT THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE WHOLE BODY OF AIR
6077-58756-0013 THAT WAS CONTAINED IN THE CYLINDER BEFORE IT WAS COMPRESSED
6077-58756-0014 IF WE WITHDRAW THE PLUNGER IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE HEAT HAS BEEN TAKEN UP BY THE WALLS OF THE SYRINGE WE SHALL FIND THE AIR OF THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS BEFORE THE PLUNGER WAS THRUST DOWN THIS HOWEVER DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANY HEAT THAT WAS GENERATED BY FRICTION
6077-58756-0015 LET US FURTHER ILLUSTRATE THE PHENOMENON BY ANOTHER EXPERIMENT IF WE SUDDENLY COMPRESS A CUBIC FOOT OF AIR AT ORDINARY PRESSURE INTO A CUBIC INCH OF SPACE THAT CUBIC INCH WILL BE VERY HOT
6077-58756-0016 BECAUSE IT CONTAINS ALL THE HEAT THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE ENTIRE CUBIC FOOT BEFORE THE COMPRESSION TOOK PLACE NOW LET IT REMAIN COMPRESSED UNTIL THE HEAT HAS RADIATED FROM IT AS IT SOON WILL AND THE AIR BECOMES OF THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS THE SURROUNDING AIR
6077-58756-0017 WHAT OUGHT TO HAPPEN IF THEN WE SHOULD SUDDENLY ALLOW THIS CUBIC INCH OF AIR TO EXPAND TO ITS NORMAL PRESSURE WHEN IT WILL OCCUPY A CUBIC FOOT OF SPACE INASMUCH AS WE ALLOWED THE HEAT TO ESCAPE FROM IT WHEN IN THE CONDENSED FORM
6077-58756-0018 WHEN IT EXPANDS IT WILL BE VERY COLD BECAUSE THE HEAT OF THE CUBIC INCH
6077-58756-0019 IS DISTRIBUTED OVER A CUBIC FOOT OF SPACE THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT TAKES PLACE WHEN HEATED AIR AT THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH WHICH IS CONDENSED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT RISES TO THE HIGHER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE THERE IS A GRADUAL EXPANSION AS IT ASCENDS
6077-58756-0020 AND CONSEQUENTLY A GRADUAL COOLING BECAUSE A GIVEN AMOUNT OF HEAT IS BEING CONSTANTLY DISTRIBUTED OVER A GREATER AMOUNT OF SPACE AT AN ALTITUDE OF FORTY FIVE MILES IT WILL HAVE EXPANDED ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TIMES
6077-58756-0021 WHICH WILL BRING THE TEMPERATURE DOWN TO BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED DEGREES BELOW ZERO WHEN WE GET BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE ATMOSPHERE WE GET INTO THE REGION OF ABSOLUTE COLD BECAUSE HEAT IS ATOMIC MOTION AND THERE CAN BE NO ATOMIC MOTION WHERE THERE ARE NO ATOMS
6077-58756-0022 PURG'D FROM THE POND'ROUS DREGS OF EARTH BELOW BY INTERPLANETARY SPACE WE MEAN ALL SPACE BETWEEN THE PLANETS NOT OCCUPIED BY SENSIBLE MATERIAL IT IS THE SAME AS INTERATOMIC SPACE OR THE SPACE BETWEEN ATOMS EXCEPT IN DEGREE
6077-58756-0023 ARE SO SMALL THAT NO SENSIBLE SUBSTANCE CAN BE MADE SUFFICIENTLY DENSE TO RESIST IT OR CONFINE IT IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT A SUBSTANCE POSSESSING SUCH QUALITIES CANNOT BE WEIGHED OR IN ANY WAY MADE APPRECIABLE TO OUR SENSES
6077-58756-0024 BUT FROM THE FACT THAT RADIANT ENERGY CAN BE TRANSMITTED THROUGH IT WITH VIBRATIONS AMOUNTING TO BILLIONS PER SECOND WE KNOW THAT IT MUST BE A SUBSTANCE WITH ELASTIC QUALITIES THAT APPROACH THE INFINITE ASSUMING THAT THE ETHER IS A SUBSTANCE THE QUESTION ARISES
6077-58756-0025 HOW IS IT RELATED TO OTHER FORMS OF SUBSTANCE THIS IS A QUESTION MORE EASILY ASKED THAN ANSWERED THE LONGER ONE DWELLS UPON THE SUBJECT HOWEVER THE MORE ONE IS IMPRESSED WITH THE THOUGHT THAT AFTER ALL THE ETHER MAY BE THE ONE ELEMENT OUT OF WHICH ALL OTHER ELEMENTS COME
6077-58756-0026 THIS IS TRUE AT LEAST AS A BASIS FOR CHEMICAL SCIENCE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MAKE GOLD ANYTHING BUT GOLD OR OXYGEN ANYTHING BUT OXYGEN AND SO ON THROUGH THE WHOLE CATALOGUE OF ELEMENTS IT MAY BE HOWEVER
6077-58756-0027 THAT THE PLAY OF FORCES UNDER AND BEYOND THOSE THAT SEEM TO BE ACTIVE IN ALL CHEMICAL PROCESSES AND RELATIONS ARE ABLE TO PRODUCE CERTAIN AFFECTIONS OF THE ETHER THE RESULT OF WHICH IN THE ONE CASE IS AN ATOM OF GOLD AND IN THE OTHER AN ATOM OF OXYGEN ET CETERA
6077-58756-0028 TO THE END OF THE LIST IN THIS CASE ALL OF THE SO CALLED ELEMENTS MAY HAVE THEIR ORIGIN IN ONE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT THAT WE CALL THE ETHER I AM AWARE THAT WE ARE WADING IN DEEP WATER HERE
6077-58756-0029 BUT SOMETIMES WE LOVE TO GET INTO DEEP WATER JUST TO TRY OUR SWIMMING POWERS THE ABOVE IS A SUGGESTION OF A THEORY CALLED THE VORTEX THEORY THAT IS TAKING ROOT IN THE MINDS OF MANY PHILOSOPHERS TO DAY AND YET THERE IS ALMOST NOTHING OF KNOWN FACTS TO BASE SUCH A THEORY UPON
6077-58756-0030 AND NEARLY ALL WE CAN SAY ABOUT IT IS THAT IT SEEMS PLAUSIBLE WHEN VIEWED THROUGH THE EYE OF IMAGINATION WE DO KNOW THAT SUBSTANCES SUCH AS FLUIDS OR GASES ASSUME VERY DIFFERENT QUALITIES WHEN PUT INTO DIFFERENT RATES OF MOTION
6077-58756-0031 A STRAW HAS BEEN KNOWN TO PENETRATE THE BODY OF A TREE ENDWISE BY THE EXTREME VELOCITY IMPARTED TO IT WHEN CARRIED IN THE VORTEX OF A TORNADO
6077-58756-0032 OR IT MAY FLOAT A LITTLE DISTANCE ABOVE THE GROUND BUT MORE FREQUENTLY IT MOVES FORWARD WITH A BOUNDING MOTION NOW TOUCHING THE EARTH AND NOW RISING IN THE AIR THIS CONE IS REVOLVING AT A TERRIFIC SPEED THE SUBSTANCE REVOLVING IS CHIEFLY AIR
6077-58756-0033 CARRYING OTHER LIGHT SUBSTANCES THAT IT HAS GATHERED UP FROM THE GROUND IF IT COMES IN CONTACT WITH A TREE OR BUILDING
6077-58756-0034 THIS IS NOT SIMPLY THE FORCE OF WIND BUT A KIND OF SOLIDITY GIVEN TO THE FLUENT AIR BY ITS WHIRLING MOTION I REMEMBER A CASE IN IOWA WHERE ONE OF THESE REVOLVING CONES PASSED THROUGH A BARNYARD STRIKING THE CORNER OF THE BARN
6077-58756-0035 CUTTING IT OFF AS SMOOTHLY AS THOUGH DONE WITH SOME SHARP EDGED TOOL BUT IT IN NO OTHER WAY AFFECTED THE REST OF THE BUILDING ONE WOULD SUPPOSE THAT THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE DEVELOPED IN THIS WHIRLING MOTION WOULD CAUSE THE CONE TO FLY APART
6077-58756-0036 AND WHY IT DOES NOT NO ONE CERTAINLY KNOWS BUT WE ARE OBLIGED TO ACCEPT THE FACT THESE CASES ARE CITED TO SHOW THAT MOTION GIVES RIGIDITY TO SUBSTANCES THAT IN THE QUIESCENT STATE ARE MOBILE OR EASILY MOVED LIKE THE STRAW OR THE AIR
6077-58756-0037 IF WE SHOULD ASSUME THAT THERE ARE INFINITESIMAL VORTICES OR WHIRLING RINGS IN THE ETHER OF SUCH RAPIDITY AS TO GIVE IT DIFFERENT DEGREES OF RIGIDITY WE CAN GET A GLIMMERING IDEA OF HOW AN ATOM OF MATTER MAY BE FORMED FROM ETHER
6077-58756-0038 REFERRING TO THE RIGIDITY WHICH MOTION GIVES TO ORDINARY MATTER IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT WHEN TWO VESSELS AT SEA COLLIDE THE ONE HAVING THE HIGHER SPEED IS NOT SO LIABLE TO INJURY AS THE ONE WITH THE LOWER THE READER WILL PERHAPS REMEMBER A CIRCUMSTANCE
6077-58756-0039 SAID TO HAVE OCCURRED A FEW YEARS AGO ON THE LAKE SHORE RAILROAD BETWEEN BUFFALO AND CLEVELAND THE LIMITED EXPRESS WAS GOING WEST AND WHILE ROUNDING A CURVE THE ENGINEER SUDDENLY CAME IN SIGHT OF A WRECKED FREIGHT TRAIN
6077-58756-0040 A PART OF WHICH WAS LYING ON THE TRACK WHERE THE EXPRESS TRAIN HAD TO PASS THE ENGINEER SAW THAT HE WAS TOO NEAR THE WRECK TO STOP HIS TRAIN
