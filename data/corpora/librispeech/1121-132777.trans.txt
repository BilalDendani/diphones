1121-132777-0000 DURING JUNE THE MEETINGS OF THOSE WHO WERE IN THE SECRET WERE FREQUENT AT LENGTH ON THE LAST DAY OF THE MONTH THE DAY ON WHICH THE BISHOPS WERE PRONOUNCED NOT GUILTY THE DECISIVE STEP WAS TAKEN A FORMAL INVITATION TRANSCRIBED BY SIDNEY
1121-132777-0001 BUT DRAWN UP BY SOME PERSON MORE SKILLED THAN SIDNEY IN THE ART OF COMPOSITION WAS DESPATCHED TO THE HAGUE IN THIS PAPER WILLIAM WAS ASSURED THAT NINETEEN TWENTIETHS OF THE ENGLISH PEOPLE WERE DESIROUS OF A CHANGE AND WOULD WILLINGLY JOIN TO EFFECT IT
1121-132777-0002 AS MIGHT SECURE THOSE WHO SHOULD RISE IN ARMS FROM THE DANGER OF BEING DISPERSED AND SLAUGHTERED BEFORE THEY COULD FORM THEMSELVES INTO ANYTHING LIKE MILITARY ORDER IF HIS HIGHNESS WOULD APPEAR IN THE ISLAND AT THE HEAD OF SOME TROOPS TENS OF THOUSANDS WOULD HASTEN TO HIS STANDARD
1121-132777-0003 HE WOULD SOON FIND HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF A FORCE GREATLY SUPERIOR TO THE WHOLE REGULAR ARMY OF ENGLAND NOR COULD THAT ARMY BE IMPLICITLY DEPENDED ON BY THE GOVERNMENT THE OFFICERS WERE DISCONTENTED
1121-132777-0004 AND THE COMMON SOLDIERS SHARED THAT AVERSION TO POPERY WHICH WAS GENERAL IN THE CLASS FROM WHICH THEY WERE TAKEN IN THE NAVY PROTESTANT FEELING WAS STILL STRONGER IT WAS IMPORTANT TO TAKE SOME DECISIVE STEP WHILE THINGS WERE IN THIS STATE
1121-132777-0005 ON ONE POINT THEY THOUGHT IT THEIR DUTY TO REMONSTRATE WITH HIS HIGHNESS HE HAD NOT TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE OPINION WHICH THE GREAT BODY OF THE ENGLISH PEOPLE HAD FORMED RESPECTING THE LATE BIRTH HE HAD ON THE CONTRARY SENT CONGRATULATIONS TO WHITEHALL
1121-132777-0006 AND HAD THUS SEEMED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE CHILD WHO WAS CALLED PRINCE OF WALES WAS RIGHTFUL HEIR OF THE THRONE THIS WAS A GRAVE ERROR
1121-132777-0007 HIS ERRAND WAS ONE OF NO ORDINARY PERIL HE ASSUMED THE GARB OF A COMMON SAILOR AND IN THIS DISGUISE REACHED THE DUTCH COAST IN SAFETY ON THE FRIDAY AFTER THE TRIAL OF THE BISHOPS HE INSTANTLY HASTENED TO THE PRINCE
1121-132777-0008 AND WHAT IS MORE EXTRAORDINARY HE HAD WON HER ENTIRE AFFECTION HE WAS TO HER IN THE PLACE OF THE PARENTS WHOM SHE HAD LOST BY DEATH AND BY ESTRANGEMENT
1121-132777-0009 AND OF THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH SHE WAS BANISHED HIS EMPIRE OVER HER HEART WAS DIVIDED ONLY WITH HER GOD TO HER FATHER SHE HAD PROBABLY NEVER BEEN ATTACHED SHE HAD QUITTED HIM YOUNG MANY YEARS HAD ELAPSED SINCE SHE HAD SEEN HIM
1121-132777-0010 AND NO PART OF HIS CONDUCT TO HER SINCE HER MARRIAGE HAD INDICATED TENDERNESS ON HIS PART OR HAD BEEN CALCULATED TO CALL FORTH TENDERNESS ON HERS HE HAD DONE ALL IN HIS POWER TO DISTURB HER DOMESTIC HAPPINESS
1121-132777-0011 AND HAD ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM OF SPYING EAVESDROPPING
1121-132777-0012 WHO FOR REFUSING TO COMMIT AN ACT OF FLAGITIOUS INJUSTICE
1121-132777-0013 HE HAD CONSPIRED WITH TYRCONNEL AND WITH FRANCE AGAINST MARY'S RIGHTS AND HAD MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR DEPRIVING HER OF ONE AT LEAST OF THE THREE CROWNS TO WHICH AT HIS DEATH
1121-132777-0014 IT WAS NOW BELIEVED BY THE GREAT BODY OF HIS PEOPLE AND BY MANY PERSONS HIGH IN RANK AND DISTINGUISHED BY ABILITIES THAT HE HAD INTRODUCED A SUPPOSITITIOUS PRINCE OF WALES INTO THE ROYAL FAMILY
1121-132777-0015 IN ORDER TO DEPRIVE HER OF A MAGNIFICENT INHERITANCE AND THERE IS NO REASON TO DOUBT THAT SHE PARTOOK OF THE PREVAILING SUSPICION THAT SHE SHOULD LOVE SUCH A FATHER WAS IMPOSSIBLE HER RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES INDEED
1121-132777-0016 AND INDEED ALL DIVINES AND PUBLICISTS AGREE IN THIS THAT WHEN THE DAUGHTER OF A PRINCE OF ONE COUNTRY IS MARRIED TO A PRINCE OF ANOTHER COUNTRY SHE IS BOUND TO FORGET HER OWN PEOPLE AND HER FATHER'S HOUSE AND
1121-132777-0017 IN THE EVENT OF A RUPTURE BETWEEN HER HUSBAND AND HER PARENTS TO SIDE WITH HER HUSBAND THIS IS THE UNDOUBTED RULE EVEN WHEN THE HUSBAND IS IN THE WRONG AND TO MARY THE ENTERPRISE WHICH WILLIAM MEDITATED APPEARED NOT ONLY JUST
1121-132777-0018 BUT HOLY BUT THOUGH SHE CAREFULLY ABSTAINED FROM DOING OR SAYING ANYTHING THAT COULD ADD TO HIS DIFFICULTIES THOSE DIFFICULTIES WERE SERIOUS INDEED THEY WERE IN TRUTH BUT IMPERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD EVEN BY SOME OF THOSE WHO INVITED HIM OVER
1121-132777-0019 AND HAVE BEEN BUT IMPERFECTLY DESCRIBED BY SOME OF THOSE WHO HAVE WRITTEN THE HISTORY OF HIS EXPEDITION THE OBSTACLES WHICH HE MIGHT EXPECT TO ENCOUNTER ON ENGLISH GROUND THOUGH THE LEAST FORMIDABLE OF THE OBSTACLES WHICH STOOD IN THE WAY OF HIS DESIGN WERE YET SERIOUS
1121-132777-0020 HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE MADNESS IN HIM TO IMITATE THE EXAMPLE OF MONMOUTH TO CROSS THE SEA WITH A FEW BRITISH ADVENTURERS AND TO TRUST TO A GENERAL RISING OF THE POPULATION IT WAS NECESSARY
1121-132777-0021 AND IT WAS PRONOUNCED NECESSARY BY ALL THOSE WHO INVITED HIM OVER THAT HE SHOULD CARRY AN ARMY WITH HIM YET WHO COULD ANSWER FOR THE EFFECT WHICH THE APPEARANCE OF SUCH AN ARMY MIGHT PRODUCE THE GOVERNMENT WAS INDEED JUSTLY ODIOUS BUT WOULD THE ENGLISH PEOPLE
1121-132777-0022 ALTOGETHER UNACCUSTOMED TO THE INTERFERENCE OF CONTINENTAL POWERS IN ENGLISH DISPUTES BE INCLINED TO LOOK WITH FAVOUR ON A DELIVERER WHO WAS SURROUNDED BY FOREIGN SOLDIERS IF ANY PART OF THE ROYAL FORCES RESOLUTELY WITHSTOOD THE INVADERS
1121-132777-0023 WOULD NOT THAT PART SOON HAVE ON ITS SIDE THE PATRIOTIC SYMPATHY OF MILLIONS A DEFEAT WOULD BE FATAL TO THE WHOLE UNDERTAKING A BLOODY VICTORY GAINED IN THE HEART OF THE ISLAND BY THE MERCENARIES OF THE STATES GENERAL OVER THE COLDSTREAM GUARDS AND THE BUFFS
1121-132777-0024 WOULD BE ALMOST AS GREAT A CALAMITY AS A DEFEAT SUCH A VICTORY WOULD BE THE MOST CRUEL WOUND EVER INFLICTED ON THE NATIONAL PRIDE OF ONE OF THE PROUDEST OF NATIONS THE CROWN SO WON WOULD NEVER BE WORN IN PEACE OR SECURITY
1121-132777-0025 THE HATRED WITH WHICH THE HIGH COMMISSION AND THE JESUITS WERE REGARDED WOULD GIVE PLACE TO THE MORE INTENSE HATRED WHICH WOULD BE INSPIRED BY THE ALIEN CONQUERORS AND MANY WHO HAD HITHERTO CONTEMPLATED THE POWER OF FRANCE WITH DREAD AND LOATHING WOULD SAY THAT
1121-132777-0026 HAD BEEN AT HIS ABSOLUTE DISPOSAL BUT IN TRUTH IT SEEMED VERY DOUBTFUL WHETHER HE WOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE ASSISTANCE OF A SINGLE BATTALION OF ALL THE DIFFICULTIES WITH WHICH HE HAD TO STRUGGLE THE GREATEST THOUGH LITTLE NOTICED BY ENGLISH HISTORIANS
1121-132777-0027 AROSE FROM THE CONSTITUTION OF THE BATAVIAN REPUBLIC NO GREAT SOCIETY HAS EVER EXISTED DURING A LONG COURSE OF YEARS UNDER A POLITY SO INCONVENIENT THE STATES GENERAL COULD NOT MAKE WAR OR PEACE
1121-132777-0028 COULD NOT CONCLUDE ANY ALLIANCE OR LEVY ANY TAX WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE STATES OF EVERY PROVINCE THE STATES OF A PROVINCE COULD NOT GIVE SUCH CONSENT WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF EVERY MUNICIPALITY WHICH HAD A SHARE IN THE REPRESENTATION
1121-132777-0029 EVERY MUNICIPALITY WAS IN SOME SENSE A SOVEREIGN STATE AND AS SUCH CLAIMED THE RIGHT OF COMMUNICATING DIRECTLY WITH FOREIGN AMBASSADORS AND OF CONCERTING WITH THEM THE MEANS OF DEFEATING SCHEMES ON WHICH OTHER MUNICIPALITIES WERE INTENT
1121-132777-0030 IN SOME TOWN COUNCILS THE PARTY WHICH HAD DURING SEVERAL GENERATIONS REGARDED THE INFLUENCE OF THE STADTHOLDERS WITH JEALOUSY HAD GREAT POWER AT THE HEAD OF THIS PARTY WERE THE MAGISTRATES OF THE NOBLE CITY OF AMSTERDAM
1121-132777-0031 WHICH WAS THEN AT THE HEIGHT OF PROSPERITY THEY HAD EVER SINCE THE PEACE OF NIMEGUEN KEPT UP A FRIENDLY CORRESPONDENCE WITH LEWIS
1121-132777-0032 PROPOSITIONS BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE STADTHOLDER AS INDISPENSABLE TO THE SECURITY OF THE COMMONWEALTH SANCTIONED BY ALL THE PROVINCES EXCEPT HOLLAND AND SANCTIONED BY SEVENTEEN OF THE EIGHTEEN TOWN COUNCILS OF HOLLAND HAD REPEATEDLY
1121-132777-0033 BEEN NEGATIVED BY THE SINGLE VOICE OF AMSTERDAM THE ONLY CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDY IN SUCH CASES WAS THAT DEPUTIES FROM THE CITIES WHICH WERE AGREED SHOULD PAY A VISIT TO THE CITY WHICH DISSENTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPOSTULATION
