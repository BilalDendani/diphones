6902-89165-0001 AND CONFESSED HERSELF CHARMED WITH EVE AS INDEED WAS EVERY ONE ELSE MISTER PARKER'S STORIES KEPT HIS END OF THE TABLE IN CONTINUAL BURSTS OF MERRIMENT ONE LITTLE INCIDENT TOO WAS IN ITS WAY EXCEEDINGLY SATISFACTORY
6902-89165-0002 MISTER AND MISSUS SAMUELSON WERE BEING ENTERTAINED BY SOME FRIENDS CLOSE AT HAND AND THEY APPEARED VERY MUCH GRATIFIED AT THE CORDIALITY OF OUR GREETING I TALKED WITH MISTER SAMUELSON DURING THE EVENING AND I FELT THAT SO FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED AT ANY RATE
6902-89165-0003 NOT A SHADOW OF SUSPICION REMAINED IN HIS MIND AS TO MY TWO GUESTS WE SAT A LONG TIME OVER DINNER EVE WAS BETWEEN A COUSIN OF MINE WHO WAS A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT A MASTER OF FOXHOUNDS AND IN HIS WAY QUITE A DISTINGUISHED PERSON
6902-89165-0004 AND THE OLD EARL OF ENTERDEAN MY GODFATHER AND THEY WERE BOTH OF THEM OBVIOUSLY HER ABJECT SLAVES NO ONE SEEMED IN THE LEAST INCLINED TO MOVE AND IT WAS NEARLY ELEVEN O'CLOCK BEFORE WE PASSED INTO THE PRIVATE ROOM I HAD ENGAGED
6902-89165-0005 WHERE COFFEE AND SOME BRIDGE TABLES AWAITED US WE BROKE UP THERE INTO LITTLE GROUPS I LEFT EVE TALKING TO MY SISTER AND WAS ON MY WAY TO TRY TO GET NEAR HER FATHER
6902-89165-0006 WHEN THE COUNTESS OF ENTERDEAN A PERFECTLY CHARMING OLD LADY WHO HAD KNOWN ME FROM BOYHOOD INTERCEPTED ME MY DEAR PAUL SHE SAID
6902-89165-0007 AND I REALLY MUST TELL YOU THIS I HAD MEANT TO KEEP IT A SECRET BUT FROM YOU I CANNOT I KNEW ALL THE TIME THAT THE NAME OF BUNDERCOMBE WAS FAMILIAR TO ME AND SUDDENLY IT CAME OVER ME LIKE A FLASH
6902-89165-0008 DIRECTLY I ASKED MISTER BUNDERCOMBE IN WHAT PART OF AMERICA HIS HOME WAS
