8302-281331-0000 SISTER NIGHTINGALE THEY SAY MAY NOT REST BUT STILL SOUNDS THE NOTES OF HER BEAUTIFUL SONG IN GROVE AND THICKET WHY DOES SHE SING THUS ALL NIGHT LONG AS WELL AS THROUGH THE DAY
8302-281331-0001 WHO IS WAITING TO CATCH HER WITH HER EYES CLOSED ONCE UPON A TIME WHEN THE WORLD WAS VERY NEW THE BLINDWORM WAS NOT QUITE BLIND BUT HAD ONE GOOD EYE MOREOVER
8302-281331-0002 IN THOSE DAYS THE NIGHTINGALE ALSO HAD BUT ONE EYE AS FOR THE BLINDWORM IT MATTERED VERY LITTLE FOR HE WAS A HOMELY CREATURE CONTENT TO CRAWL ABOUT IN THE DARK UNDERGROUND
8302-281331-0003 WHERE NOBODY SAW HIM AND NOBODY CARED BUT THE NIGHTINGALE'S CASE WAS REALLY QUITE TOO PITIFUL FANCY THE SWEETEST SINGER AMONG ALL THE BIRDS THE FAVORITE CHORISTER GOING ABOUT WITH BUT ONE EYE
8302-281331-0004 WHILE EVERY ONE ELSE EVEN THE TINIEST LITTLE HUMMING BIRD OF ALL HAD TWO THE NIGHTINGALE FELT VERY SORE ABOUT THIS MATTER AND TRIED TO CONCEAL HER MISFORTUNE FROM THE OTHER BIRDS
8302-281331-0005 SHE MANAGED TO COCK HER HEAD THE OTHER WAY WHENEVER SHE MET A FRIEND AND SHE ALWAYS FLEW PAST ANY STRANGER SO FAST THAT HE NEVER SAW THE EMPTY SOCKET WHERE HER OTHER PRETTY EYE SHOULD BE BUT ONE DAY THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT AMONG THE BIRDS
8302-281331-0006 MISS JENNY WREN WAS GOING TO BE MARRIED TO YOUNG COCK ROBIN THERE WAS TO BE A GRAND WEDDING EVERY ONE WAS INVITED
8302-281331-0007 BUT THE POOR NIGHTINGALE WAS SET IN A FLUTTER OF ANXIETY BY THE NEWS
8302-281331-0008 BUT HOW CAN I GO IF I DO THE OTHER BIRDS WILL DISCOVER THAT I HAVE BUT ONE EYE AND THEN HOW THE DISAGREEABLE CREATURES WILL LAUGH AT ME OH DEAR OH DEAR WHAT SHALL I DO I CANNOT GO NO
8302-281331-0009 I REALLY CANNOT BUT WHAT EXCUSE CAN I GIVE OH IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT THE SWEETEST SINGER IN ALL BIRDLAND SHOULD BE LAUGHED AT MERELY BECAUSE SHE HAS THE MISFORTUNE TO LACK ONE POOR LITTLE EYE
8302-281331-0010 THE NIGHTINGALE SAT ON THE BRANCH SINGING SO MOURNFULLY THAT ALL THE CREATURES ON THE GROUND BELOW WENT SORROWFULLY ABOUT THEIR DAILY BUSINESS JUST THEN THE NIGHTINGALE SPIED A SILVERY GLEAM AMONG THE DEAD LEAVES
8302-281331-0011 IT WAS THE BLINDWORM A SPOTTED GRAY STREAK WRITHING NOISELESSLY ALONG TOWARDS THE DECAYED WOOD OF A FALLEN TREE IN WHICH HE LOVED TO BURROW AND THE BLINDWORM WAS NOT SAD LIKE THE OTHERS
8302-281331-0012 WORMS THINK LITTLE OF SWEET SOUNDS HE COCKED HIS ONE EYE UP TOWARDS THE NIGHTINGALE AND WINKED MALICIOUSLY HE ALONE OF ALL CREATURES KNEW THE NIGHTINGALE'S SECRET
8302-281331-0013 GOOD DAY SISTER NIGHTINGALE HE SAID HOW IS YOUR EYE THIS MORNING WE HAVE A GOODLY PAIR BETWEEN US
8302-281331-0014 THEN HE DISAPPEARED INTO A TINY OPENING FOR THOUGH THE BLINDWORM IS NEARLY A FOOT LONG HE IS SO SMOOTH AND SLIPPERY THAT HE CAN ENTER A HOLE WHICH IS ALMOST SMALLER THAN HIMSELF
8302-281331-0015 THE NIGHTINGALE WAS VERY INDIGNANT AT BEING ADDRESSED IN THIS FAMILIAR WAY BY A MISERABLE CRAWLING CREATURE WHO NOT ONLY COULD NOT FLY BUT WHO COULD NOT SING A NOTE
8302-281331-0016 BESIDES IT MADE HER ANGRY TO THINK THAT HE KNEW HER SECRET AND TALKED ALOUD ABOUT IT
8302-281331-0017 BUT TO BE JEERED AT BY THIS CREATURE IT IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR HA I HAVE AN IDEA I WILL PUNISH HIM AND HELP MYSELF AT THE SAME TIME I WILL STEAL HIS ONE EYE
8302-281331-0018 AND WEAR IT TO JENNY WREN'S WEDDING THEN NO ONE WILL EVER DISCOVER MY MISFORTUNE NOW THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT SCHEME
8302-281331-0019 FOR THE BLINDWORM WAS VERY TIMID AND KEPT HIMSELF CAREFULLY HIDDEN IN HIS BURROW OF SOFT SOIL AS IF HE HALF SUSPECTED THE NIGHTINGALE'S PLANS DAY AFTER DAY THE NIGHTINGALE KEPT EAGER WATCH UPON HIS MOVEMENTS
8302-281331-0020 AND AT LAST ON THE VERY EVE OF THE WEDDING WHEN SHE HAD ALMOST GIVEN UP HOPE SHE SPIED THE BLINDWORM SOUND ASLEEP ON THE MOSS UNDER A TALL TREE HA SAID THE NIGHTINGALE TO HERSELF VERY SOFTLY
8302-281331-0021 SHE FLUTTERED INTO THE TOP OF THE OAK TREE AND FROM THERE HOPPED DOWN FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH FROM TWIG TO TWIG UNTIL SHE WAS DIRECTLY OVER THE SLEEPER'S UGLY HEAD OVER THE ONE CLOSED EYE THEN WHIRR
8302-281331-0022 DOWN SHE POUNCED UPON THE BLINDWORM AND BEFORE THE CREATURE HAD A CHANCE TO KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING THE NIGHTINGALE HAD STOLEN HIS EYE AND HAD POPPED IT INTO PLACE IN THE EMPTY SOCKET ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HER BEAK HA HA
8302-281331-0023 SHE SANG MERRILY NOW I HAVE TWO BRIGHT EYES AS GOOD AS ANY ONE'S NOW I CAN GO TO JENNY WREN'S WEDDING AS GAYLY AS I PLEASE
8302-281331-0024 AND NO ONE SHALL SEE MORE OF THE CEREMONY THAN I I SHALL BE ABLE TO TELL JUST EXACTLY HOW THE BRIDE IS DRESSED HOW EVERY LITTLE FEATHER IS ARRANGED AND HOW SHE LOOKS AFTER PARSON CROW HAS PRONOUNCED THE BLESSING
8302-281331-0025 OH HOW HAPPY I AM BUT THE POOR BLINDWORM BLIND INDEED FROM THAT DAY FORTH BEGAN TO CRY AND LAMENT BEGGING THE NIGHTINGALE TO GIVE HIM BACK HIS EYE NAY SAID THE NIGHTINGALE
8302-281331-0026 DID YOU NOT LAUGH AT ME WHEN YOU SAW ME SADLY SITTING ON THE TREE MOURNING BECAUSE I COULD NOT GO TO THE WEDDING NOW I HAVE STOLEN YOUR EYE AND I CAN SEE FAMOUSLY BUT YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN SEE ME SITTING SADLY ON THE TREE
8302-281331-0027 THEN THE BLINDWORM GREW VERY ANGRY I WILL GET THE EYE BACK HE CRIED I WILL STEAL IT FROM YOU AS YOU STOLE IT FROM ME SOME TIME WHEN YOU ARE ASLEEP
8302-281331-0028 THEN YOU WILL BE BLIND WHOLLY BLIND AS I AM NOW AT THESE THREATENING WORDS THE NIGHTINGALE CEASED TO SING
8302-281331-0029 FOR SHE KNEW THAT THE BLINDWORM WOULD DO AS HE SAID BUT AGAIN A BRILLIANT THOUGHT CAME TO HER NAY SHE TRILLED GLADLY THAT YOU SHALL NEVER DO I WILL NEVER SLEEP AGAIN I WILL KEEP AWAKE ALWAYS NIGHT AND DAY
8302-281331-0030 YES NO ONE SHALL EVER CATCH ME NAPPING YOU CANNOT HELP YOURSELF SAID THE BLINDWORM YOU CANNOT KEEP AWAKE YOU WILL DROWSE IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING I SHALL YET FIND YOU ASLEEP SOME NIGHT AND THEN BEWARE
8302-281331-0031 NAY NAY WARBLED THE NIGHTINGALE AS SHE FLEW AWAY TO MAKE HERSELF FINE FOR THE WEDDING I SHALL SING SING SING NIGHT AND DAY HENCEFORTH TO KEEP MYSELF AWAKE AND THUS I NEED NOT FEAR FAREWELL WELL WELL
8302-281331-0032 AND SO THE NIGHTINGALE WENT TO THE WEDDING
8302-281331-0033 THAN SHE HAD EVER SUNG BEFORE AND AFTER THAT ALTHOUGH SHE WAS WEARY OH SO WEARY SHE SANG ALL NIGHT LONG
