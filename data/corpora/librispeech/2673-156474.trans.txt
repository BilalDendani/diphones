2673-156474-0000 BATTLE OF THE IRONCLADS FLAG OFFICER FARRAGUT FORTS JACKSON AND SAINT PHILIP NEW ORLEANS CAPTURED
2673-156474-0001 FARRAGUT AT VICKSBURG FARRAGUT'S SECOND EXPEDITION TO VICKSBURG RETURN TO NEW ORLEANS IN ADDITION TO ITS HEAVY WORK OF MAINTAINING THE ATLANTIC BLOCKADE
2673-156474-0002 EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO AFTER CAREFUL PREPARATION DURING SEVERAL MONTHS A JOINT EXPEDITION UNDER THE COMMAND OF GENERAL AMBROSE E BURNSIDE AND FLAG OFFICER GOLDSBOROUGH
2673-156474-0003 BEFORE THE LARGER VESSELS COULD EFFECT THEIR ENTRANCE THROUGH HATTERAS INLET CAPTURED IN THE PREVIOUS AUGUST A FURIOUS STORM SET IN WHICH DELAYED THE EXPEDITION NEARLY A MONTH BY FEBRUARY SEVENTH HOWEVER
2673-156474-0004 THAT AND OTHER SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES WERE OVERCOME AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE EXPEDITION CAPTURED ROANOKE ISLAND AND THUS COMPLETELY OPENED THE WHOLE INTERIOR WATER SYSTEM OF ALBEMARLE AND PAMLICO SOUNDS
2673-156474-0005 AND THE REDUCTION OF FORT MACON AND THE REBEL DEFENSES OF ELIZABETH CITY NEW BERNE AND OTHER SMALLER PLACES AN EVENTUAL ADVANCE UPON GOLDSBORO FORMED PART OF THE ORIGINAL PLAN
2673-156474-0006 BUT BEFORE IT COULD BE EXECUTED CIRCUMSTANCES INTERVENED EFFECTUALLY TO THWART THAT OBJECT WHILE THE GRADUAL OCCUPATION OF THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST WAS GOING ON TWO OTHER EXPEDITIONS OF A SIMILAR NATURE WERE MAKING STEADY PROGRESS
2673-156474-0007 ONE OF THEM UNDER THE DIRECTION OF GENERAL QUINCY A GILLMORE CARRIED ON A REMARKABLE SIEGE OPERATION AGAINST FORT PULASKI STANDING ON AN ISOLATED SEA MARSH AT THE MOUTH OF THE SAVANNAH RIVER
2673-156474-0008 HERE NOT ONLY THE DIFFICULTIES OF APPROACH BUT THE APPARENTLY INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLE OF MAKING THE SOFT UNCTUOUS MUD SUSTAIN HEAVY BATTERIES WAS OVERCOME AND THE FORT COMPELLED TO SURRENDER ON APRIL ELEVENTH
2673-156474-0009 AFTER AN EFFECTIVE BOMBARDMENT THE SECOND WAS AN EXPEDITION OF NINETEEN SHIPS WHICH WITHIN A FEW DAYS DURING THE MONTH OF MARCH WITHOUT SERIOUS RESISTANCE
2673-156474-0010 THE DESTRUCTION AT THAT TIME ATTEMPTED BY COMMODORE PAULDING REMAINED VERY INCOMPLETE AMONG THE VESSELS SET ON FIRE THE SCREW FRIGATE MERRIMAC WHICH HAD BEEN SCUTTLED
2673-156474-0011 WAS BURNED ONLY TO THE WATER'S EDGE LEAVING HER HULL AND MACHINERY ENTIRELY UNINJURED IN DUE TIME SHE WAS RAISED BY THE CONFEDERATES COVERED WITH A SLOPING ROOF OF RAILROAD IRON
2673-156474-0012 PROVIDED WITH A HUGE WEDGE SHAPED PROW OF CAST IRON AND ARMED WITH A FORMIDABLE BATTERY OF TEN GUNS SECRET INFORMATION CAME TO THE NAVY DEPARTMENT OF THE PROGRESS OF THIS WORK
2673-156474-0013 IN SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE THE PARTICULAR ONE OF THESE THREE ESPECIALLY INTENDED FOR THIS PECULIAR EMERGENCY WAS A SHIP OF ENTIRELY NOVEL DESIGN MADE BY THE CELEBRATED INVENTOR JOHN ERICSSON
2673-156474-0014 A SWEDE BY BIRTH BUT AMERICAN BY ADOPTION A MAN WHO COMBINED GREAT ORIGINAL GENIUS WITH LONG SCIENTIFIC STUDY AND EXPERIENCE HIS INVENTION MAY BE MOST QUICKLY DESCRIBED AS HAVING A SMALL VERY LOW HULL
2673-156474-0015 COVERED BY A MUCH LONGER AND WIDER FLAT DECK ONLY A FOOT OR TWO ABOVE THE WATER LINE UPON WHICH WAS PLACED A REVOLVING IRON TURRET TWENTY FEET IN DIAMETER NINE FEET HIGH AND EIGHT INCHES THICK
2673-156474-0016 ON THE INSIDE OF WHICH WERE TWO ELEVEN INCH GUNS TRAINED SIDE BY SIDE AND REVOLVING WITH THE TURRET THIS UNIQUE NAVAL STRUCTURE WAS PROMPTLY NICKNAMED A CHEESE BOX ON A RAFT
2673-156474-0017 AND THE DESIGNATION WAS NOT AT ALL INAPT NAVAL EXPERTS AT ONCE RECOGNIZED THAT HER SEA GOING QUALITIES WERE BAD BUT COMPENSATION WAS THOUGHT TO EXIST IN THE BELIEF THAT HER IRON TURRET WOULD RESIST SHOT AND SHELL
2673-156474-0018 AND IT QUICKLY BECAME CERTAIN THAT THIS WAS THE MUCH TALKED OF REBEL IRONCLAD MERRIMAC OR AS THE CONFEDERATES HAD RENAMED HER THE VIRGINIA SHE STEAMED RAPIDLY TOWARD NEWPORT NEWS THREE MILES TO THE SOUTHWEST
2673-156474-0019 WHERE THE UNION SHIPS CONGRESS AND CUMBERLAND LAY AT ANCHOR THESE SAW THE UNCOUTH MONSTER COMING AND PREPARED FOR ACTION THE MINNESOTA THE SAINT LAWRENCE AND THE ROANOKE LYING AT FORTRESS MONROE ALSO SAW HER
2673-156474-0020 NEITHER DID THE BROADSIDES OF HER INTENDED PREY NOR THE FIRE OF THE SHORE BATTERIES FOR EVEN AN INSTANT ARREST HER SPEED AS RUSHING ON SHE STRUCK THE CUMBERLAND
2673-156474-0021 AND WITH HER IRON PROW BROKE A HOLE AS LARGE AS A HOGSHEAD IN HER SIDE THEN BACKING AWAY AND HOVERING OVER HER VICTIM AT CONVENIENT DISTANCE SHE RAKED HER DECKS WITH SHOT AND SHELL UNTIL AFTER THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR'S COMBAT
2673-156474-0022 WHO HAD MAINTAINED THE FIGHT WITH UNYIELDING STUBBORNNESS WENT TO THE BOTTOM IN FIFTY FEET OF WATER WITH COLORS FLYING HAVING SUNK THE CUMBERLAND
2673-156474-0023 THE MERRIMAC NEXT TURNED HER ATTENTION TO THE CONGRESS WHICH HAD MEANWHILE RUN INTO SHOAL WATER AND GROUNDED WHERE THE REBEL VESSEL COULD NOT FOLLOW BUT THE MERRIMAC BEING HERSELF APPARENTLY PROOF AGAINST SHOT AND SHELL BY HER IRON PLATING
2673-156474-0024 TOOK UP A RAKING POSITION TWO CABLES LENGTH AWAY AND DURING AN HOUR'S FIRING DELIBERATELY REDUCED THE CONGRESS TO HELPLESSNESS AND TO SURRENDER HER COMMANDER BEING KILLED AND THE VESSEL SET ON FIRE
2673-156474-0025 THE APPROACH THE MANOEUVERING AND THE TWO SUCCESSIVE COMBATS CONSUMED THE AFTERNOON AND TOWARD NIGHTFALL THE MERRIMAC AND HER THREE SMALL CONSORTS THAT HAD TAKEN LITTLE PART IN THE ACTION WITHDREW TO THE REBEL BATTERIES ON THE VIRGINIA SHORE
2673-156474-0026 THAT SAME NIGHT WHILE THE BURNING CONGRESS YET LIGHTED UP THE WATERS OF HAMPTON ROADS A LITTLE SHIP AS STRANGE LOOKING AND AS NEW TO MARINE WARFARE AS THE REBEL TURTLEBACK HERSELF ARRIVED BY SEA IN TOW FROM NEW YORK
2673-156474-0027 AND RECEIVING ORDERS TO PROCEED AT ONCE TO THE SCENE OF CONFLICT STATIONED HERSELF NEAR THE GROUNDED MINNESOTA THIS WAS ERICSSON'S CHEESE BOX ON A RAFT NAMED BY HIM THE MONITOR
2673-156474-0028 THE UNION OFFICERS WHO HAD WITNESSED THE DAY'S EVENTS WITH DISMAY AND WERE FILLED WITH GLOOMY FOREBODINGS FOR THE MORROW WHILE WELCOMING THIS PROVIDENTIAL REINFORCEMENT WERE BY NO MEANS REASSURED
2673-156474-0029 THE MONITOR WAS ONLY HALF THE SIZE OF HER ANTAGONIST AND HAD ONLY TWO GUNS TO THE OTHER'S TEN BUT THIS VERY DISPARITY PROVED AN ESSENTIAL ADVANTAGE WITH ONLY TEN FEET DRAFT TO THE MERRIMAC'S TWENTY TWO
2673-156474-0030 LIEUTENANT JOHN L WORDEN COMMANDING THE MONITOR STEAMED BOLDLY OUT TO MEET HER THEN ENSUED A THREE HOURS NAVAL CONFLICT WHICH HELD THE BREATHLESS ATTENTION OF THE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS AND THE SPECTATORS ON SHIP AND SHORE
2673-156474-0031 AND FOR MANY WEEKS EXCITED THE WONDERMENT OF THE READING WORLD IF THE MONITOR'S SOLID ELEVEN INCH BALLS BOUNDED WITHOUT APPARENT EFFECT FROM THE SLOPING ROOF OF THE MERRIMAC SO IN TURN
2673-156474-0032 THE MERRIMAC'S BROADSIDES PASSED HARMLESSLY OVER THE LOW DECK OF THE MONITOR OR REBOUNDED FROM THE ROUND SIDES OF HER IRON TURRET
2673-156474-0033 TRIED TO RAM THE POINTED RAFT THAT CARRIED THE CHEESE BOX
2673-156474-0034 EASILY GLIDED OUT OF THE LINE OF DIRECT IMPACT EACH SHIP PASSED THROUGH OCCASIONAL MOMENTS OF DANGER BUT THE LONG THREE HOURS ENCOUNTER ENDED WITHOUT OTHER SERIOUS DAMAGE THAN AN INJURY TO LIEUTENANT WORDEN
2673-156474-0035 BY THE EXPLOSION OF A REBEL SHELL AGAINST A CREVICE OF THE MONITOR'S PILOT HOUSE THROUGH WHICH HE WAS LOOKING WHICH TEMPORARILY BLINDING HIS EYE SIGHT DISABLED HIM FROM COMMAND AT THAT POINT THE BATTLE ENDED BY MUTUAL CONSENT THE MONITOR
2673-156474-0036 RAN INTO SHOAL WATER TO PERMIT SURGICAL ATTENDANCE TO HER WOUNDED OFFICER
