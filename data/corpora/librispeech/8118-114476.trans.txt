8118-114476-0000 AND THE WAY AT LAST LAY CLEAR BEFORE THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC DICK WAS MOUNTED AGAIN IN FACT HIS HORSE AFTER PULLING THE REINS FROM HIS HANDS AND FLEEING FROM THE CONFEDERATE FIRE HAD BEEN RETAKEN BY A MEMBER OF HIS OWN REGIMENT AND RETURNED TO HIM IT WAS ANOTHER GOOD OMEN
8118-114476-0001 THE LOST HAD BEEN FOUND AGAIN AND DEFEAT WOULD BECOME VICTORY BUT DICK SAID NOTHING TO ANYBODY OF HIS DUEL WITH HARRY KENTON HE SHUDDERED EVEN NOW WHEN HE RECALLED IT AND YET THERE HAD BEEN NO GUILT IN EITHER
8118-114476-0002 NEITHER HAD KNOWN THAT THE OTHER LAY BEHIND THE STONE BUT HAPPY CHANCE HAD MADE ALL THEIR BULLETS GO ASTRAY AGAIN HE WAS THANKFUL HOW DID YOU STAND THAT FIGHTING YESTERDAY AFTERNOON GEORGE DICK ASKED OF WARNER FIRST RATE
8118-114476-0003 THE OPEN AIR AGREED WITH ME AND AS NO BULLET SOUGHT ME OUT I FELT BENEFITED I DIDN'T GET AWAY FROM THAT HOSPITAL TOO SOON HOW FAR AWAY IS THIS ANTIETAM RIVER BEHIND WHICH THEY SAY LEE LIES IT'S ONLY EIGHT MILES FROM THE GAP SAID PENNINGTON WHO HAD BEEN MAKING INQUIRIES
8118-114476-0004 AND AS WE HAVE COME THREE MILES IT MUST BE ONLY FIVE MILES AWAY CORRECT SAID WARNER WHO WAS IN AN UNCOMMONLY FINE HUMOR YOUR MATHEMATICAL POWER GROWS EVERY DAY FRANK LET X EQUAL THE WHOLE DISTANCE FROM THE GAP TO THE ANTIETAM WHICH IS EIGHT MILES
8118-114476-0005 BY GEORGE WE'RE DRIVING THEIR SKIRMISHERS BEFORE US THEY DON'T SEEM TO MAKE ANY STAND AT ALL THE VANGUARD CERTAINLY MET WITH NO VERY FORMIDABLE RESISTANCE AS IT ADVANCED OVER THE ROLLING COUNTRY THE SOUND OF FIRING WAS CONTINUOUS BUT IT CAME FROM SMALL SQUADS HERE AND THERE
8118-114476-0006 AND AFTER FIRING A FEW VOLLEYS THE MEN IN GRAY INVARIABLY WITHDREW YET THE NORTHERN ADVANCE WAS SLOW COLONEL WINCHESTER BECAME INTENSELY IMPATIENT AGAIN WHY DON'T WE HURRY HE EXCLAIMED OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD THE ONE THAT WE NEED MOST IS HASTE
8118-114476-0007 WITH JACKSON TIED UP BEFORE HARPER'S FERRY LEE'S DEFEAT IS SURE UNLESS HE RETREATS ACROSS THE POTOMAC AND THAT WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO A DEFEAT GOOD HEAVENS WHY DON'T WE PUSH ON HE HAD NOT YET HEARD OF THE FALL OF HARPER'S FERRY AND THAT JACKSON WITH PICKED BRIGADES WAS ALREADY ON THE WAY TO JOIN LEE
8118-114476-0008 HAD HE KNOWN THESE TWO VITAL FACTS HIS ANGER WOULD HAVE BURNED TO A WHITE HEAT
8118-114476-0009 DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE ANTIETAM COLONEL ASKED DICK IT'S A NARROW STREAM BUT DEEP AND CROSSED BY SEVERAL STONE BRIDGES IT WILL BE HARD TO FORCE A CROSSING HERE BUT FURTHER UP IT CAN BE DONE WITH EASE SINCE WE OUTNUMBER LEE SO MUCH THAT WE CAN OVERLAP HIM BY FAR
8118-114476-0010 I HAVE MY INFORMATION FROM SHEPARD AND HE MAKES NO MISTAKES THERE IS A CHURCH TOO ON THE UPPER PART OF THE PENINSULA A LITTLE CHURCH BELONGING TO AN ORDER CALLED THE DUNKARDS AH MURMURED DICK THE LITTLE CHURCH OF SHILOH
8118-114476-0011 THERE WAS A LITTLE CHURCH AT SHILOH TOO THE BATTLE RAGED ALL AROUND IT MORE THAN ONCE WE LOST IT AT FIRST BUT IN THE END WE WON
8118-114476-0012 I HOPE AND BELIEVE SO WE'VE THE MATERIALS WITH WHICH TO DO IT BUT WE'VE GOT TO PUSH AND PUSH HARD THE COLONEL RAISED HIS GLASSES AND TOOK A LONG LOOK IN FRONT DICK ALSO HAD A PAIR AND HE TOO EXAMINED THE COUNTRY BEFORE THEM
8118-114476-0013 IT WAS A FINE ROLLING REGION AND ALL THE FOREST WAS GONE EXCEPT CLUMPS OF TREES HERE AND THERE
8118-114476-0014 IT WAS NOW NEARLY NOON AND THE SUNLIGHT WAS BRILLIANT AND INTENSE THE GLASSES CARRIED FAR DICK SAW A LINE OF TREES WHICH HE SURMISED MARKED THE COURSE OF THE ANTIETAM AND HE SAW SMALL DETACHMENTS OF CAVALRY WHICH HE KNEW WERE WATCHING THE ADVANCE OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC
8118-114476-0015 THEIR PURPOSE CONVINCED HIM THAT LEE HAD NOT RETREATED ACROSS THE POTOMAC BUT THAT HE WOULD FIGHT AND SURELY LOSE DICK NOW BELIEVED THAT SO MANY GOOD OMENS COULD NOT FAIL A HORSEMAN GALLOPED TOWARD THEM IT WAS SHEPARD AGAIN DUSTIER THAN EVER HIS FACE PALE FROM WEARINESS
8118-114476-0016 WHAT IS IT MISTER SHEPARD ASKED COLONEL WINCHESTER I'VE JUST REPORTED TO GENERAL MC CLELLAN THAT OUR WHOLE COMMAND AT HARPER'S FERRY THIRTEEN THOUSAND STRONG SURRENDERED EARLY THIS MORNING AND THAT JACKSON WITH PICKED MEN HAS ALREADY STARTED TO JOIN LEE
8118-114476-0017 MY GOD MY GOD CRIED THE COLONEL OH THAT LOST DAY WE OUGHT TO HAVE FOUGHT YESTERDAY AND DESTROYED LEE WHILE HARPER'S FERRY WAS STILL HOLDING OUT WHAT A DAY WHAT A DAY NOTHING CAN EVER PAY US BACK FOR THE LOSING OF IT
8118-114476-0018 JACKSON MIGHT COME BUT IT WOULD ONLY BE WITH A PART OF HIS FORCE THAT WHICH MARCHED THE SWIFTEST AND THE VICTORY OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC WOULD BE ALL THE GRANDER
8118-114476-0019 DICK LOOKED BACK AND HE SAW ONCE MORE THAT VAST BILLOWING CLOUD OF DUST MADE BY THE MARCHING ARMY BUT IN FRONT HE SAW ONLY QUIET AND PEACE SAVE FOR A FEW DISTANT HORSEMEN WHO SEEMED TO BE RIDING AT RANDOM
8118-114476-0020 SAID SHEPARD WHO STAYED WITH THEM HIS IMMEDIATE WORK DONE AND THE POTOMAC BEING VERY LOW OWING TO THE DRY SEASON THERE IS ONE FORD BY WHICH LEE CAN CROSS AND GO BACK TO VIRGINIA BUT HE ISN'T GOING TO CROSS WITHOUT A BATTLE THAT'S SURE
8118-114476-0021 THE REBELS ARE FLUSHED WITH VICTORY THEY THINK THEY HAVE THE GREATEST LEADERS EVER BORN AND THEY BELIEVE DESPITE THE DISPARITY OF NUMBERS THAT THEY CAN BEAT US AND I BELIEVE THEY CAN'T SAID DICK
8118-114476-0022 SAID SHEPARD AND WE'D BE MARCHING AGAINST JACKSON THE REGIMENT IN ITS SWIFT ADVANCE NOW CAME NEARER TO THE ANTIETAM THE NARROW BUT DEEP CREEK BETWEEN ITS HIGH BANKS
8118-114476-0023 ONE OR TWO SHOTS FROM THE FAR SIDE WARNED THEM TO COME MORE SLOWLY AND COLONEL WINCHESTER DREW HIS MEN UP ON A KNOLL WAITING FOR THE REST OF THE ARMY TO ADVANCE
8118-114476-0024 GREAT ARMIES DRAWN UP FOR BATTLE WERE A SPECTACLE THAT NO BOY COULD EVER VIEW CALMLY AND HIS HEART BEAT SO HARD THAT IT CAUSED HIM ACTUAL PHYSICAL PAIN HE SAW THROUGH THE POWERFUL GLASSES THE WALLS OF THE LITTLE VILLAGE OF SHARPSBURG
8118-114476-0025 AND TO THE NORTH A ROOF WHICH HE BELIEVED WAS THAT OF THE DUNKARD CHURCH OF WHICH SHEPARD SPOKE BUT HIS EYES CAME BACK FROM THE CHURCH AND RESTED ON THE COUNTRY AROUND SHARPSBURG
8118-114476-0026 BEYOND THE PENINSULA HE CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF THE BROAD POTOMAC THERE LAY LEE BEFORE THEM AGAIN AND NOW WAS THE TIME TO DESTROY HIS ARMY JACKSON EVEN WITH HIS VANGUARD COULD NOT ARRIVE BEFORE NIGHT AND THE MAIN FORCE CERTAINLY COULD NOT COME FROM HARPER'S FERRY BEFORE THE MORROW
8118-114476-0027 HERE WAS A FULL HALF DAY FOR THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC ENOUGH IN WHICH TO DESTROY A DIVIDED PORTION OF THE ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA BUT COLONEL WINCHESTER RAGED AGAIN AND AGAIN IN VAIN THERE WAS NO ATTACK BRIGADE AFTER BRIGADE IN BLUE CAME UP AND SAT DOWN BEFORE THE ANTIETAM
8118-114476-0028 THE WINCHESTER REGIMENT WAS MOVED FAR TO THE NORTH WHERE ITS OFFICERS HOPEFULLY BELIEVED THAT THE FIRST ATTACK WOULD BE MADE HERE THEY EXTENDED BEYOND LEE'S LINE AND IT WOULD BE EASY TO CROSS THE ANTIETAM AND HURL THEMSELVES UPON HIS FLANK
8118-114476-0029 DESPITE THE DELAY DICK AND HIS COMRADES THRILLED AT THE GREAT AND TERRIBLE PANORAMA SPREAD BEFORE THEM THE MID SEPTEMBER DAY HAD BECOME AS HOT AS THOSE OF AUGUST HAD BEEN
8118-114476-0030 BUT THEY DID NOT HIDE THE VIEW OF THE ARMIES ARRAYED FOR BATTLE AND WITH ONLY A NARROW RIVER BETWEEN DICK THROUGH HIS OWN GLASSES SAW CONFEDERATE OFFICERS WATCHING THEM ALSO HE TRIED TO IMAGINE THAT THIS WAS LEE AND THAT LONGSTREET AND THAT ONE OF THE HILLS
8118-114476-0031 AND THE ONE WHO WORE A GORGEOUS UNIFORM MUST SURELY BE STUART WHY SHOULD THEY BE ALLOWED TO RIDE ABOUT SO CALMLY HIS HEART FAIRLY ACHED FOR THE ATTACK MC CLELLAN SAID THAT FIFTY THOUSAND MEN WERE THERE AND THAT JACKSON WAS COMING WITH FIFTY THOUSAND MORE BUT SHEPARD WHO ALWAYS KNEW
8118-114476-0032 SAID THAT THEY DID NOT NUMBER MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND WHAT A CHANCE WHAT A CHANCE HE ALMOST REPEATED COLONEL WINCHESTER'S WORDS BUT HE WAS ONLY A YOUNG STAFF OFFICER AND IT WAS NOT FOR HIM TO COMPLAIN IF HE SAID ANYTHING AT ALL HE WOULD HAVE TO SAY IT IN A GUARDED MANNER AND TO HIS BEST FRIENDS
8118-114476-0033 THE WINCHESTER REGIMENT WENT INTO CAMP IN A PLEASANT GROVE AT THE NORTHERN END OF THE UNION LINE DICK AND HIS TWO YOUNG COMRADES HAD NO FAULT TO FIND WITH THEIR QUARTERS THEY HAD DRY GRASS WARM AIR AND THE OPEN SKY A MORE COMFORTABLE SUMMER HOME FOR A NIGHT COULD NOT BE ASKED
8118-114476-0034 AND THERE WAS PLENTY OF FOOD TOO THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC NEVER LACKED IT THE COFFEE WAS ALREADY BOILING IN THE POTS AND BEEF AND PORK WERE FRYING IN THE SKILLETS
8118-114476-0035 DICK AND HIS COMRADES ATE AND DRANK AND THEN LAY DOWN IN THE GROVE IF THEY MUST REST THEY WOULD REST WELL
8118-114476-0036 BUT NOW THE NIGHT WAS QUIET SAVE FOR THE MURMUR AND MOVEMENT OF A GREAT ARMY THROUGH THE DARKNESS CAME THE SOUND OF MANY VOICES AND THE CLANK OF MOVING WHEELS DICK ASKED PERMISSION FOR HIS TWO COMRADES AND HIMSELF TO GO DOWN NEAR THE RIVER AND OBTAINED IT BUT DON'T GET SHOT
8118-114476-0037 CAUTIONED COLONEL WINCHESTER THE CONFEDERATE RIFLEMEN WILL CERTAINLY BE ON WATCH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREAM DICK PROMISED AND THE THREE WENT FORWARD VERY CAREFULLY AMONG SOME BUSHES THEY WERE LED ON BY CURIOSITY AND THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE IN ANY GREAT DANGER
