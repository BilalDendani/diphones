3650-168643-0000 ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY GARDENS WHICH SEEM MADE TO BE LOOKED AT IN WINTER AND AT NIGHT THIS GARDEN WAS OBLONG IN SHAPE WITH AN ALLEY OF LARGE POPLARS AT THE FURTHER END TOLERABLY TALL FOREST TREES IN THE CORNERS
3650-168643-0001 WHERE COULD BE SEEN A VERY LARGE SOLITARY TREE THEN SEVERAL FRUIT TREES GNARLED AND BRISTLING LIKE BUSHES BEDS OF VEGETABLES A MELON PATCH WHOSE GLASS FRAMES SPARKLED IN THE MOONLIGHT AND AN OLD WELL
3650-168643-0002 HERE AND THERE STOOD STONE BENCHES WHICH SEEMED BLACK WITH MOSS THE ALLEYS WERE BORDERED WITH GLOOMY AND VERY ERECT LITTLE SHRUBS THE GRASS HAD HALF TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEM AND A GREEN MOULD COVERED THE REST
3650-168643-0003 JEAN VALJEAN HAD BESIDE HIM THE BUILDING WHOSE ROOF HAD SERVED HIM AS A MEANS OF DESCENT A PILE OF FAGOTS AND BEHIND THE FAGOTS DIRECTLY AGAINST THE WALL A STONE STATUE
3650-168643-0004 WHOSE MUTILATED FACE WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING MORE THAN A SHAPELESS MASK WHICH LOOMED VAGUELY THROUGH THE GLOOM THE BUILDING WAS A SORT OF RUIN WHERE DISMANTLED CHAMBERS WERE DISTINGUISHABLE ONE OF WHICH MUCH ENCUMBERED SEEMED TO SERVE AS A SHED
3650-168643-0005 TURNED TWO FACADES AT RIGHT ANGLES
3650-168643-0006 THESE INTERIOR FACADES WERE EVEN MORE TRAGIC THAN THE EXTERIOR ALL THE WINDOWS WERE GRATED NOT A GLEAM OF LIGHT WAS VISIBLE AT ANY ONE OF THEM THE UPPER STORY HAD SCUTTLES LIKE PRISONS ONE OF THOSE FACADES CAST ITS SHADOW ON THE OTHER
3650-168643-0007 WHICH FELL OVER THE GARDEN LIKE AN IMMENSE BLACK PALL NO OTHER HOUSE WAS VISIBLE THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN WAS LOST IN MIST AND DARKNESS NEVERTHELESS WALLS COULD BE CONFUSEDLY MADE OUT WHICH INTERSECTED AS THOUGH THERE WERE MORE CULTIVATED LAND BEYOND
3650-168643-0008 AND THE LOW ROOFS OF THE RUE POLONCEAU NOTHING MORE WILD AND SOLITARY THAN THIS GARDEN COULD BE IMAGINED THERE WAS NO ONE IN IT WHICH WAS QUITE NATURAL IN VIEW OF THE HOUR
3650-168643-0009 EVEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT JEAN VALJEAN'S FIRST CARE HAD BEEN TO GET HOLD OF HIS SHOES AND PUT THEM ON AGAIN THEN TO STEP UNDER THE SHED WITH COSETTE A MAN WHO IS FLEEING NEVER THINKS HIMSELF SUFFICIENTLY HIDDEN
3650-168643-0010 THE CHILD WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE STILL ON THE THENARDIER SHARED HIS INSTINCT FOR WITHDRAWING FROM SIGHT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE COSETTE TREMBLED AND PRESSED CLOSE TO HIM
3650-168643-0011 THEY HEARD THE TUMULTUOUS NOISE OF THE PATROL SEARCHING THE BLIND ALLEY AND THE STREETS THE BLOWS OF THEIR GUN STOCKS AGAINST THE STONES JAVERT'S APPEALS TO THE POLICE SPIES WHOM HE HAD POSTED AND HIS IMPRECATIONS MINGLED WITH WORDS
3650-168643-0012 WHICH COULD NOT BE DISTINGUISHED AT THE EXPIRATION OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THAT SPECIES OF STORMY ROAR WERE BECOMING MORE DISTANT JEAN VALJEAN HELD HIS BREATH
3650-168643-0013 HOWEVER THE SOLITUDE IN WHICH HE STOOD WAS SO STRANGELY CALM THAT THIS FRIGHTFUL UPROAR CLOSE AND FURIOUS AS IT WAS DID NOT DISTURB HIM BY SO MUCH AS THE SHADOW OF A MISGIVING IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THOSE WALLS HAD BEEN BUILT OF THE DEAF STONES OF WHICH THE SCRIPTURES SPEAK
3650-168643-0014 A FRESH SOUND AROSE A SOUND AS CELESTIAL DIVINE INEFFABLE RAVISHING AS THE OTHER HAD BEEN HORRIBLE IT WAS A HYMN WHICH ISSUED FROM THE GLOOM
3650-168643-0015 A DAZZLING BURST OF PRAYER AND HARMONY IN THE OBSCURE AND ALARMING SILENCE OF THE NIGHT WOMEN'S VOICES BUT VOICES COMPOSED AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME OF THE PURE ACCENTS OF VIRGINS AND THE INNOCENT ACCENTS OF CHILDREN
3650-168643-0016 VOICES WHICH ARE NOT OF THE EARTH AND WHICH RESEMBLE THOSE THAT THE NEWBORN INFANT STILL HEARS AND WHICH THE DYING MAN HEARS ALREADY THIS SONG PROCEEDED FROM THE GLOOMY EDIFICE WHICH TOWERED ABOVE THE GARDEN
3650-168643-0017 AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE HUBBUB OF DEMONS RETREATED ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT A CHOIR OF ANGELS WAS APPROACHING THROUGH THE GLOOM COSETTE AND JEAN VALJEAN FELL ON THEIR KNEES THEY KNEW NOT WHAT IT WAS THEY KNEW NOT WHERE THEY WERE
3650-168643-0018 BUT BOTH OF THEM THE MAN AND THE CHILD THE PENITENT AND THE INNOCENT FELT THAT THEY MUST KNEEL THESE VOICES HAD THIS STRANGE CHARACTERISTIC THAT THEY DID NOT PREVENT THE BUILDING FROM SEEMING TO BE DESERTED
3650-168643-0019 IT WAS A SUPERNATURAL CHANT IN AN UNINHABITED HOUSE
3650-168643-0020 HE NO LONGER BEHELD THE NIGHT HE BEHELD A BLUE SKY IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE FELT THOSE WINGS WHICH WE ALL HAVE WITHIN US UNFOLDING THE SONG DIED AWAY IT MAY HAVE LASTED A LONG TIME JEAN VALJEAN COULD NOT HAVE TOLD
3650-168643-0021 HOURS OF ECSTASY ARE NEVER MORE THAN A MOMENT ALL FELL SILENT AGAIN THERE WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING IN THE STREET THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE GARDEN THAT WHICH HAD MENACED THAT WHICH HAD REASSURED HIM ALL HAD VANISHED
