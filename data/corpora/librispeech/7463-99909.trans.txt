7463-99909-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE ANTONIO SPATOLA APPEARS ASHTON KIRK AND PENDLETON WERE ADMITTED TO THE CELL ROOM AT THE CITY HALL WITHOUT QUESTION BUT A DISTINCT SURPRISE AWAITED THEM THERE
7463-99909-0001 THROUGH A PRIVATE DOOR LEADING FROM THE DETECTIVES QUARTERS THEY SAW THE BULKY FORM OF OSBORNE EMERGE AND AT HIS HEELS WERE BERNSTINE AND HIS SANDY HAIRED CLERK
7463-99909-0002 WHEN OSBORNE CAUGHT SIGHT OF ASHTON KIRK HE EXPANDED INTO A WIDE SMILE OF SATISFACTION
7463-99909-0003 GREETED HE GLAD TO SEE YOU YOU'RE JUST IN TIME TO SEE ME TURN A NEW TRICK HERE'S THE PEOPLE THAT SPATOLA BOUGHT THE BAYONET FROM HOW DOES THAT STRIKE YOU BUT BERNSTINE LEANED OVER AND SAID SOMETHING IN A LOW TONE
7463-99909-0004 AND THE SMILE INSTANTLY DEPARTED OH SAID OSBORNE RUEFULLY THIS IS THE PARTY WHO CALLED TO SEE YOU IS IT THEN TURNING TO ASHTON KIRK HE ASKED
7463-99909-0005 HOW DID YOU GET ONTO THIS BAYONET BUSINESS JUST THROUGH THINKING IT OVER A LITTLE THAT'S ALL ANSWERED THE INVESTIGATOR MISTER BERNSTINE NOW APPROACHED THE SPEAKER A HURT LOOK UPON HIS FACE
7463-99909-0006 MISTER ASHTON KIRK SAID HE WHY DID YOU NOT TELL US ABOUT THIS PIECE OF BUSINESS WHY DID YOU NOT ENLIGHTEN US HOW COULD YOU GO AWAY AND LEAVE US IN THE DARK WE ARE VERY MUCH OCCUPIED AND HAVE LITTLE TIME TO LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS
7463-99909-0007 IT WAS ONLY BY ACCIDENT THAT SIME HAPPENED TO SEE ONE LOWERING HIS VOICE HE ADDED THERE'S A SMART FELLOW FOR YOU HE SAW THE WHOLE THING IN AN INSTANT AND SO WE CAME RIGHT HERE TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO HELP JUSTICE
7463-99909-0008 HE SQUARED HIS SHOULDERS IMPORTANTLY HE'S SEEN THE BAYONET AND IS PREPARED TO SWEAR TO IT STATED OSBORNE ELATED WHAT OF THE PICTURE OF SPATOLA IN THE PAPER ASKED THE INVESTIGATOR
7463-99909-0009 DOES HE RECOGNIZE THAT OSBORNE'S FACE FELL ONCE MORE THESE HALF TONES DONE THROUGH COARSE SCREENS ARE NEVER ANY GOOD SAID HE
7463-99909-0010 AND THAT'LL SETTLE IT WITH THAT A TURNKEY WAS DISPATCHED AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY A HALF DOZEN PRISONERS ONE WAS A SLIM DARK YOUNG MAN
7463-99909-0011 WITH A NERVOUS EXPRESSIVE LOOK AND A GREAT TANGLE OF CURLING BLACK HAIR THE FACE WAS HAGGARD AND DRAWN THE EYES WERE FRIGHTENED THE WHOLE MANNER OF THE MAN HAD A PITEOUS APPEAL
7463-99909-0012 OSBORNE TURNED TO SIME LOOK THEM OVER CAREFULLY DIRECTED HE TAKE YOUR TIME I DON'T NEED TO ANSWERED THE FRECKLED SHIPPING CLERK HE POINTED TO THE DARK YOUNG MAN
7463-99909-0013 THEN HE MOTIONED ANOTHER ATTENDANT TO TAKE THE REMAINING PRISONERS AWAY I SEE SAID HE HE WAS TOO FOXY TO BUY THE THING HIMSELF HE SENT SOMEONE ELSE
7463-99909-0014 THEN HE FIXED HIS EYE ON THE PRISONER AND CONTINUED WE'VE GOT THE BAYONET ON YOU SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL TELL US ALL ABOUT IT I DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID SPATOLA ANXIOUSLY
7463-99909-0015 THE EASIER YOU MAKE IT FOR US THE EASIER IT WILL BE FOR YOU OSBORNE TOLD HIM IF YOU MAKE US SWEAT FITTING THIS THING TO YOU WE'LL GIVE YOU THE LIMIT DON'T FORGET THAT I HAVE DONE NOTHING SAID SPATOLA EARNESTLY
7463-99909-0016 IS THERE NOT A LAW THERE IS SAID OSBORNE GRIMLY THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU ABOUT NOW WHO BOUGHT THE BAYONET THE BAYONET SPATOLA STARED
7463-99909-0017 WITH A TRULY LATIN GESTURE OF DESPAIR THE ITALIAN PUT HIS HANDS TO HIS FOREHEAD
7463-99909-0018 ALWAYS HUME I CAN NOT BE FREE OF HIM
7463-99909-0019 EVEN WHEN HE IS DEAD I AM MOCKED BY HIM HE WAS ALL EVIL I BELIEVE HE WAS A DEVIL THAT WAS NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD KILL HIM SAID OSBORNE IN THE POSITIVE MANNER OF THE THIRD DEGREE
7463-99909-0020 I'VE HEARD YOU SAY ALL THAT BEFORE STATED OSBORNE WEARILY THEN TO THE TURNKEY TAKE HIM AWAY CURTIS JUST A MOMENT INTERPOSED ASHTON KIRK I CAME HERE TO HAVE A FEW WORDS WITH THIS PRISONER
7463-99909-0021 AND BY YOUR LEAVE I'LL SPEAK TO HIM NOW ALL RIGHT REPLIED OSBORNE HELP YOURSELF HE LED BERNSTINE AND SIME OUT OF THE CELL ROOM THE TURNKEY WITH PROFESSIONAL COURTESY
7463-99909-0022 AND ASHTON KIRK TURNED TO THE ITALIAN YOU WERE ONCE FIRST VIOLIN WITH KARLSON SAID HE I REMEMBER YOU WELL I ALWAYS ADMIRED YOUR ART
7463-99909-0023 AN EAGER LOOK CAME INTO THE PRISONER'S FACE I THANK YOU HE SAID
7463-99909-0024 I AM YOUNG WITH DESPAIR YET HOW I HAVE SUNKEN IT IS SOMETHING OF A DROP ADMITTED ASHTON KIRK
7463-99909-0025 FROM A POSITION OF FIRST VIOLIN WITH KARLSON TO THAT OF A STREET MUSICIAN HOW DID IT HAPPEN SADLY THE YOUNG ITALIAN TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD WITH ONE LONG FINGER THE FAULT
7463-99909-0026 HE DECLARED IS HERE I HAVE NOT THE WHAT DO YOU CALL IT SENSE WHAT HAPPENED WITH KARLSON HAPPENED A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE IN ITALY IN FRANCE IN SPAIN I HAVE NOT THE GOOD SENSE
7463-99909-0027 BUT JUSTIFICATION CAME INTO HIS EYES AND HIS HANDS BEGAN TO GESTICULATE ELOQUENTLY KARLSON IS A SWEDE WITH CONTEMPT THE SWEDES KNOW THE SCIENCE OF MUSIC BUT THEY ARE HARD THEY ARE SELDOM ARTISTS
7463-99909-0028 THEY CANNOT EXPRESS AND WHEN ONE OF THIS NATION A MAN WITH THE ICE OF HIS COUNTRY IN HIS SOUL TRIED TO INSTRUCT ME HOW TO PLAY THE WARM MUSIC OF MY OWN ITALY I CALLED HIM A FOOL I SEE
7463-99909-0029 SAID THE INVESTIGATOR I AM TO BLAME SAID SPATOLA CONTRITELY
7463-99909-0030 AND FOOLS SELDOM LIKE TO HEAR THE TRUTH THE GERMANS NOW SAID ASHTON KIRK INSINUATINGLY ARE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THE SWEDES WERE YOU EVER EMPLOYED UNDER A GERMAN CONDUCTOR
7463-99909-0031 TWICE REPLIED THE VIOLINIST WITH A SHRUG NOBODY CAN DENY THE ART OF THE GERMANS BUT THEY HAVE THEIR FAULTS THEY SAY THEY KNOW THE VIOLIN
7463-99909-0032 BUT THE ITALIAN HAS TAUGHT THEM THE VIOLIN BELONGS TO ITALY IT WAS THE GLORY OF CREMONA WAS IT NOT THE TENDER HANDS OF THE AMATIS OF JOSEF GUARNERIUS OF OLD ANTONIO STRADIVARI
7463-99909-0033 PLACED A SOUL WITHIN THE WOODEN BOX AND THAT SOUL IS THE SOUL OF ITALY HAUPT A GERMAN WROTE A TREATISE ON THE VIOLIN SAID ASHTON KIRK IF YOU WOULD READ THAT
7463-99909-0034 AND HE SNAPPED HIS FINGERS IMPATIENTLY BUT YOU'VE PROBABLY READ A TRANSLATION IN THE ENGLISH OR ITALIAN INSISTED THE INVESTIGATOR SMOOTHLY AND ALL TRANSLATIONS LOSE SOMETHING OF THEIR VITALITY YOU KNOW
7463-99909-0035 I HAVE READ IT IN THE GERMAN DECLARED THE ITALIAN IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE JUST AS HE WROTE IT
7463-99909-0036 PENDLETON LOOKED AT ASHTON KIRK ADMIRINGLY THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS FRIEND HAD ESTABLISHED THE FACT THAT SPATOLA KNEW THE GERMAN LANGUAGE SEEMED TO HIM VERY CLEVER BUT ASHTON KIRK MADE NO SIGN
7463-99909-0037 OTHER THAN THAT OF INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT UPON WHICH THEY TALKED A RACE THAT HAS GIVEN THE WORLD SUCH MUSICIANS AS WAGNER BEETHOVEN AND MOZART SAID HE MUST POSSESS IN A TREMENDOUS DEGREE THE MUSICAL SENSE
7463-99909-0038 THE GERMAN KNOWLEDGE OF TONE AND ITS COMBINATIONS IS EXTRAORDINARY AND THEIR MUSIC IN TURN IS AS COMPLEX AS THEIR PSYCHOLOGY AND AS SIMPLE AS THE IMPROVISATION OF A CHILD
7463-99909-0039 ONLY THE OTHER DAY I CAME UPON A BOOKLET PUBLISHED IN LEIPZIG THAT DEALT WITH THE DIFFICULTY A COMPOSER SOMETIMES ENCOUNTERS IN GETTING THE NOTES ON PAPER WHEN A MELODY SWEEPS THROUGH HIS BRAIN THE WRITER CLAIMED THAT THE WORLD HAD LOST THOUSANDS OF INSPIRATIONS BECAUSE OF THIS
7463-99909-0040 AND TO PREVENT FURTHER LOSS HE PROFFERED AN INVENTION A SYSTEM OF SO TO SPEAK MUSICAL SHORTHAND A SULLEN LOOK OF SUSPICION CAME INTO SPATOLA'S FACE
7463-99909-0041 HE REGARDED THE SPEAKER FROM UNDER LOWERED BROWS PERHAPS YOU DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF SUCH AN INVENTION PROCEEDED ASHTON KIRK BUT IF YOU HAD A KNOWLEDGE OF STENOGRAPHY AND THE SHORT CUTS IT BUT THE ITALIAN INTERRUPTED HIM BRUSQUELY
7463-99909-0042 I KNOW NOTHING OF SUCH THINGS SAID HE AND WHAT IS MORE I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING OF THEM THEN IN A SHARP ANGRY TONE HE ADDED
7463-99909-0043 IS IT ALWAYS TO BE SO FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER AT THIS SUDDEN DISPLAY OF RESENTMENT THE TURNKEY APPROACHED I WILL GO BACK TO MY CELL SPATOLA TOLD HIM AND PLEASE DO NOT BRING ME OUT AGAIN MY NERVES ARE BAD
7463-99909-0044 I HAVE BEEN WORRIED MUCH OF LATE AND I CAN'T STAND IT THE TURNKEY LOOKED AT ASHTON KIRK WHO NODDED HIS HEAD AND AS SPATOLA WAS LED GESTICULATING AWAY PENDLETON SAID IN A LOW TONE OF CONVICTION
7463-99909-0045 AS SOON AS YOU MENTIONED SHORTHAND HE BECAME SUSPICIOUS AND SHOWED UNEASINESS AND ANGER I TELL YOU AGAIN
