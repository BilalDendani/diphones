543-133217-0000 HE CONSULTED PANGLOSS MARTIN AND THE FAITHFUL CACAMBO
543-133217-0001 MARTIN WAS FOR THROWING THE BARON INTO THE SEA CACAMBO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DELIVER HIM UP AGAIN TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GALLEY AFTER WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE GENERAL FATHER OF THE ORDER AT ROME BY THE FIRST SHIP
543-133217-0002 THIS ADVICE WAS WELL RECEIVED THE OLD WOMAN APPROVED IT THEY SAID NOT A WORD TO HIS SISTER THE THING WAS EXECUTED FOR A LITTLE MONEY AND THEY HAD THE DOUBLE PLEASURE OF ENTRAPPING A JESUIT AND PUNISHING THE PRIDE OF A GERMAN BARON
543-133217-0003 CACAMBO WHO WORKED IN THE GARDEN AND TOOK VEGETABLES FOR SALE TO CONSTANTINOPLE WAS FATIGUED WITH HARD WORK AND CURSED HIS DESTINY PANGLOSS WAS IN DESPAIR AT NOT SHINING IN SOME GERMAN UNIVERSITY
543-133217-0004 FOR MARTIN HE WAS FIRMLY PERSUADED THAT HE WOULD BE AS BADLY OFF ELSEWHERE AND THEREFORE BORE THINGS PATIENTLY
543-133217-0005 COMING TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THE EXILES AND AFTERWARDS EXILED IN THEIR TURN THEY SAW HEADS DECENTLY IMPALED FOR PRESENTATION TO THE SUBLIME PORTE
543-133217-0006 SUCH SPECTACLES AS THESE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF THEIR DISSERTATIONS AND WHEN THEY DID NOT DISPUTE TIME HUNG SO HEAVILY UPON THEIR HANDS THAT ONE DAY THE OLD WOMAN VENTURED TO SAY TO THEM I WANT TO KNOW WHICH IS WORSE
543-133217-0007 TO BE RAVISHED A HUNDRED TIMES BY NEGRO PIRATES TO HAVE A BUTTOCK CUT OFF TO RUN THE GAUNTLET AMONG THE BULGARIANS TO BE WHIPPED AND HANGED AT AN AUTO DA FE
543-133217-0008 TO BE DISSECTED TO ROW IN THE GALLEYS IN SHORT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MISERIES WE HAVE UNDERGONE OR TO STAY HERE
543-133217-0009 THIS DISCOURSE GAVE RISE TO NEW REFLECTIONS AND MARTIN ESPECIALLY CONCLUDED THAT MAN WAS BORN TO LIVE EITHER IN A STATE OF DISTRACTING INQUIETUDE OR OF LETHARGIC DISGUST
543-133217-0010 IN EXTREME MISERY THEY HAD SOON SQUANDERED THEIR THREE THOUSAND PIASTRES PARTED WERE RECONCILED QUARRELLED AGAIN
543-133217-0011 PAQUETTE CONTINUED HER TRADE WHEREVER SHE WENT BUT MADE NOTHING OF IT
543-133217-0012 IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE LIVED A VERY FAMOUS DERVISH WHO WAS ESTEEMED THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN ALL TURKEY AND THEY WENT TO CONSULT HIM PANGLOSS WAS THE SPEAKER

543-133217-0016 THIS CATASTROPHE MADE A GREAT NOISE FOR SOME HOURS
543-133217-0017 I AM ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE EVENT YOU MENTION
543-133217-0018 THEIR LITTLE PLOT OF LAND PRODUCED PLENTIFUL CROPS
543-133217-0019 PAQUETTE WORKED AT EMBROIDERY THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED AFTER THE LINEN
