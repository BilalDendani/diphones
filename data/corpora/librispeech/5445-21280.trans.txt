5445-21280-0000 THREE DAYS PASSED ON THE FOURTH MARCELLA RETURNED LATE IN THE AFTERNOON FROM A ROUND OF PARISH VISITS WITH MARY HARDEN AS SHE OPENED THE OAK DOORS WHICH SHUT OFF THE CENTRAL HALL OF MELLOR FROM THE OUTER VESTIBULE
5445-21280-0001 SHE SAW SOMETHING WHITE LYING ON THE OLD CUT AND DISUSED BILLIARD TABLE WHICH STILL OCCUPIED THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR TILL RICHARD BOYCE IN THE COURSE OF HIS ECONOMIES AND IMPROVEMENTS COULD REPLACE IT BY A NEW ONE SHE RAN FORWARD AND TOOK UP A SHEAF OF CARDS
5445-21280-0002 TURNING THEM OVER IN A SMILING EXCITEMENT
5445-21280-0003 MISTER RAEBURN MISS RAEBURN LADY WINTERBOURNE
5445-21280-0004 TRYING WITH SHORTSIGHTED EYES TO DISTINGUISH HER DAUGHTER AMONG THE SHADOWS OF THE GREAT BARE PLACE A DARK DAY WAS DRAWING TO ITS CLOSE
5445-21280-0005 BRINGING OUT THE OBSTINATE MOUTH AND THE WHITE HAND HOLDING A JEWELLED GLOVE
5445-21280-0006 ANY LETTERS SHE ASKED NO BUT THERE ARE SOME CARDS OH YES THERE IS A NOTE AND SHE POUNCED UPON AN ENVELOPE SHE HAD OVERLOOKED IT IS FOR YOU MOTHER
5445-21280-0007 FROM THE COURT MISSUS BOYCE CAME UP AND TOOK NOTE AND CARDS FROM HER DAUGHTER'S HAND MARCELLA WATCHED HER WITH QUICK BREATH HER MOTHER LOOKED THROUGH THE CARDS SLOWLY PUTTING THEM DOWN ONE BY ONE WITHOUT REMARK OH MOTHER DO READ THE NOTE
5445-21280-0008 MARCELLA COULD NOT HELP ENTREATING MISSUS BOYCE DREW HERSELF TOGETHER WITH A QUICK MOVEMENT AS THOUGH HER DAUGHTER JARRED UPON HER AND OPENED THE NOTE MARCELLA DARED NOT LOOK OVER HER
5445-21280-0009 THERE WAS A DIGNITY ABOUT HER MOTHER'S LIGHTEST ACTION ABOUT EVERY MOVEMENT OF HER SLENDER FINGERS AND FINE FAIR HEAD WHICH HAD ALWAYS HELD THE DAUGHTER IN CHECK EVEN WHILE SHE REBELLED MISSUS BOYCE READ IT AND THEN HANDED IT TO MARCELLA
5445-21280-0010 I MUST GO AND MAKE THE TEA SHE SAID IN A LIGHT COLD TONE AND TURNING SHE WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM WHITHER AFTERNOON TEA HAD JUST BEEN CARRIED MARCELLA FOLLOWED READING THE NOTE WAS FROM MISS RAEBURN
5445-21280-0011 AND IT CONTAINED AN INVITATION TO MISSUS BOYCE AND HER DAUGHTER TO TAKE LUNCHEON AT THE COURT ON THE FOLLOWING FRIDAY THE NOTE WAS COURTEOUSLY AND KINDLY WORDED WE SHOULD BE SO GLAD SAID THE WRITER
5445-21280-0012 TO SHOW YOU AND MISS BOYCE OUR BEAUTIFUL WOODS WHILE THEY ARE STILL AT THEIR BEST IN THE WAY OF AUTUMN COLOUR HOW WILL MAMMA TAKE IT THOUGHT MARCELLA ANXIOUSLY THERE IS NOT A WORD OF PAPA WHEN SHE ENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM
5445-21280-0013 SHE CAUGHT HER MOTHER STANDING ABSENTLY AT THE TEA TABLE THE LITTLE SILVER CADDY WAS STILL IN HER HAND AS THOUGH SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO PUT IT DOWN AND HER EYES WHICH EVIDENTLY SAW NOTHING WERE TURNED TO THE WINDOW THE BROWS FROWNING
5445-21280-0014 THE LOOK OF SUFFERING FOR AN INSTANT WAS UNMISTAKABLE THEN SHE STARTED AT THE SOUND OF MARCELLA'S STEP AND PUT DOWN THE CADDY AMID THE DELICATE CHINA CROWDED ON THE TRAY WITH ALL THE QUIET PRECISION OF HER ORDINARY MANNER
5445-21280-0015 YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR YOUR TEA SHE SAID THE WATER DOESN'T NEARLY BOIL MARCELLA WENT UP TO THE FIRE AND KNEELING BEFORE IT PUT THE LOGS WITH WHICH IT WAS PILED TOGETHER BUT SHE COULD NOT CONTAIN HERSELF FOR LONG
5445-21280-0016 WITHIN TWO MILES OF HER AND IT HAS NEVER OCCURRED TO HER TO CALL NOW SHE CALLS AND ASKS US TO LUNCHEON IN THE SAME AFTERNOON EITHER SHE TOOK TOO LITTLE NOTICE OF US BEFORE
5445-21280-0017 DON'T YOU THINK SO MARCELLA WAS SILENT A MOMENT SHOULD SHE CONFESS IT BEGAN TO OCCUR TO HER FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT IN HER WILD INDEPENDENCE SHE HAD BEEN TAKING LIBERTIES WITH HER MOTHER MAMMA YES
5445-21280-0018 I ASKED MISTER ALDOUS RAEBURN THE OTHER DAY WHETHER EVERYBODY HERE WAS GOING TO CUT US PAPA TOLD ME THAT LORD MAXWELL HAD WRITTEN HIM AN UNCIVIL LETTER AND YOU ASKED MISTER RAEBURN SAID MISSUS BOYCE QUICKLY WHAT DO YOU MEAN
5445-21280-0019 MARCELLA TURNED ROUND AND MET THE FLASH OF HER MOTHER'S EYES I COULDN'T HELP IT SHE SAID IN A LOW HURRIED VOICE IT SEEMED SO HORRID TO FEEL EVERYBODY STANDING ALOOF WE WERE WALKING TOGETHER
5445-21280-0020 MARCELLA FELT AN INSTANT'S FEAR FEAR OF THE IRONIC POWER IN THE SPARKLING LOOK SO KEENLY FIXED ON HER OFFENDING SELF SHE SHRANK BEFORE THE PROUD RESERVE EXPRESSED IN EVERY LINE OF HER MOTHER'S FRAGILE IMPERIOUS BEAUTY
5445-21280-0021 THEN A CRY OF NATURE BROKE FROM THE GIRL YOU HAVE GOT USED TO IT MAMMA
5445-21280-0022 SHUT OFF FROM EVERYBODY JOINING WITH NOBODY WITH NO FRIENDLY FEELINGS OR SOCIETY IT WAS BAD ENOUGH IN THE OLD LODGING HOUSE DAYS BUT HERE WHY SHOULD WE MISSUS BOYCE HAD CERTAINLY GROWN PALE
5445-21280-0023 BUT THE QUESTION WITH ME HAS ALWAYS BEEN SHALL I ACCEPT PITY I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO MEET IT WITH A NO YOU ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM ME BUT FOR YOU ALSO I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE THE HAPPIEST ANSWER
5445-21280-0024 THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS I WANT TO DO HERE AND ONE CAN DO NOTHING IF EVERY ONE IS AGAINST YOU PEOPLE WOULD BE FRIENDS WITH YOU AND ME AND WITH PAPA TOO THROUGH US SOME OF THEM WISH TO BE KIND
5445-21280-0025 THINKING OF ALDOUS RAEBURN'S WORDS AND EXPRESSION AS HE BENT TO HER AT THE GATE I KNOW THEY DO AND IF WE CAN'T HOLD OUR HEADS HIGH BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THINGS IN THE PAST OUGHT WE TO BE SO PROUD
5445-21280-0026 THAT WE WON'T TAKE THEIR HANDS WHEN THEY STRETCH THEM OUT WHEN THEY WRITE SO KINDLY AND NICELY AS THIS AND SHE LAID HER FINGERS ALMOST PITEOUSLY ON THE NOTE UPON HER KNEE MISSUS BOYCE TILTED THE SILVER URN
5445-21280-0027 AND REPLENISHED THE TEA POT THEN WITH A DELICATE HANDKERCHIEF SHE RUBBED AWAY A SPOT FROM THE HANDLE OF A SPOON NEAR HER YOU SHALL GO SHE SAID PRESENTLY YOU WISH IT THEN GO GO BY ALL MEANS
5445-21280-0028 I WILL WRITE TO MISS RAEBURN AND SEND YOU OVER IN THE CARRIAGE ONE CAN PUT A GREAT DEAL ON HEALTH MINE IS QUITE SERVICEABLE IN THE WAY OF EXCUSES
5445-21280-0029 IF YOU HAVE CHOSEN YOUR LINE AND WISH TO MAKE FRIENDS HERE VERY WELL I WILL DO WHAT I CAN FOR YOU SO LONG AS YOU DO NOT EXPECT ME TO CHANGE MY LIFE FOR WHICH MY DEAR I AM GROWN TOO CROTCHETY AND TOO OLD MARCELLA LOOKED AT HER WITH DISMAY
5445-21280-0030 AND A YEARNING SHE HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE AND YOU WILL NEVER GO OUT WITH ME MAMMA THERE WAS SOMETHING CHILDLIKE AND TOUCHING IN THE VOICE SOMETHING WHICH FOR ONCE SUGGESTED THE NORMAL FILIAL RELATION BUT MISSUS BOYCE DID NOT WAVER
5445-21280-0031 IN YOUR INTERESTS AS WELL AS MINE YOU WILL MAKE ALL THE GREATER IMPRESSION MY DEAR FOR I HAVE REALLY FORGOTTEN HOW TO BEHAVE THOSE CARDS SHALL BE PROPERLY RETURNED OF COURSE FOR THE REST LET NO ONE DISTURB THEMSELVES TILL THEY MUST
5445-21280-0032 AND IF I WERE YOU MARCELLA I WOULD HARDLY DISCUSS THE FAMILY AFFAIRS ANY MORE WITH MISTER RAEBURN OR ANYBODY ELSE AND AGAIN HER KEEN GLANCE DISCONCERTED THE TALL HANDSOME GIRL WHOSE POWER OVER THE WORLD ABOUT HER HAD NEVER EXTENDED TO HER MOTHER
5445-21280-0033 MARCELLA FLUSHED AND PLAYED WITH THE FIRE YOU SEE MAMMA SHE SAID AFTER A MOMENT STILL LOOKING AT THE LOGS AND THE SHOWER OF SPARKS THEY MADE AS SHE MOVED THEM ABOUT YOU NEVER LET ME DISCUSS THEM WITH YOU HEAVEN FORBID
5445-21280-0034 SAID MISSUS BOYCE QUICKLY THEN AFTER A PAUSE
5445-21280-0035 AND YOU WILL SEE IF YOU SO CHOOSE IT THAT THERE WILL BE NOTHING UNSURMOUNTABLE IN YOUR WAY ONE PIECE OF ADVICE LET ME GIVE YOU DON'T BE TOO GRATEFUL TO MISS RAEBURN OR ANYBODY ELSE
5445-21280-0036 YOU TAKE GREAT INTEREST IN YOUR BOYCE BELONGINGS I PERCEIVE YOU MAY REMEMBER TOO PERHAPS THAT THERE IS OTHER BLOOD IN YOU AND THAT NO MERRITT HAS EVER SUBMITTED QUIETLY TO EITHER PATRONAGE OR PITY MARCELLA STARTED
5445-21280-0037 BUT NO ONE OF THEM HAD CROSSED THE BOYCES THRESHOLD SINCE THE OLD LONDON DAYS WHEREIN MARCELLA COULD STILL DIMLY REMEMBER THE TALL FORMS OF CERTAIN MERRITT UNCLES AND EVEN A STATELY LADY IN A WHITE CAP WHOM SHE KNEW TO HAVE BEEN HER MOTHER'S MOTHER
5445-21280-0038 THE STATELY LADY HAD DIED WHILE SHE WAS STILL A CHILD AT HER FIRST SCHOOL SHE COULD RECOLLECT HER OWN MOURNING FROCK BUT THAT WAS ALMOST THE LAST PERSONAL REMEMBRANCE SHE HAD CONNECTED WITH THE MERRITTS
5445-21280-0039 AND NOW THIS NOTE OF INTENSE PERSONAL AND FAMILY PRIDE UNDER WHICH MISSUS BOYCE'S VOICE HAD FOR THE FIRST TIME QUIVERED A LITTLE MARCELLA HAD NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE AND IT THRILLED HER
