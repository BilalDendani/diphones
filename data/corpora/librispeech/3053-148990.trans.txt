3053-148990-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN IN THE TENNIS COURT ATHLETIC SPORTS WERE IN HIGH FAVOUR AT PLUMFIELD AND THE RIVER WHERE THE OLD PUNT USED TO WABBLE ABOUT WITH A CARGO OF SMALL BOYS OR ECHO TO THE SHRILL SCREAMS OF LITTLE GIRLS TRYING TO GET LILIES
3053-148990-0001 NOW WAS ALIVE WITH BOATS OF ALL KINDS FROM THE SLENDER WHERRY TO THE TRIM PLEASURE CRAFT GAY WITH CUSHIONS AWNINGS AND FLUTTERING PENNONS EVERYONE ROWED AND THE GIRLS AS WELL AS THE YOUTHS HAD THEIR RACES AND DEVELOPED THEIR MUSCLES IN THE MOST SCIENTIFIC MANNER
3053-148990-0002 THE LARGE LEVEL MEADOW NEAR THE OLD WILLOW WAS NOW THE COLLEGE PLAYGROUND AND HERE BASEBALL BATTLES RAGED WITH FURY VARIED BY FOOTBALL LEAPING AND KINDRED SPORTS FITTED TO SPLIT THE FINGERS BREAK THE RIBS AND STRAIN THE BACKS OF THE TOO AMBITIOUS PARTICIPANTS
3053-148990-0003 THE GENTLER PASTIMES OF THE DAMSELS WERE AT A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THIS CHAMP DE MARS CROQUET MALLETS CLICKED UNDER THE ELMS THAT FRINGED THE FIELD RACKETS ROSE AND FELL ENERGETICALLY IN SEVERAL TENNIS COURTS
3053-148990-0004 AND GATES OF DIFFERENT HEIGHTS WERE HANDY TO PRACTISE THE GRACEFUL BOUND BY WHICH EVERY GIRL EXPECTED TO SAVE HER LIFE SOME DAY WHEN THE MAD BULL WHICH WAS ALWAYS COMING BUT NEVER SEEMED TO ARRIVE SHOULD BE BELLOWING AT HER HEELS ONE OF THESE TENNIS GROUNDS WAS CALLED JO'S COURT
3053-148990-0005 AND HERE THE LITTLE LADY RULED LIKE A QUEEN FOR SHE WAS FOND OF THE GAME AND BEING BENT ON DEVELOPING HER SMALL SELF TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF PERFECTION SHE WAS TO BE FOUND AT EVERY LEISURE MOMENT WITH SOME VICTIM HARD AT IT ON A CERTAIN PLEASANT SATURDAY AFTERNOON
3053-148990-0006 SHE HAD BEEN PLAYING WITH BESS AND BEATING HER FOR THOUGH MORE GRACEFUL THE PRINCESS WAS LESS ACTIVE THAN HER COUSIN AND CULTIVATED HER ROSES BY QUIETER METHODS OH DEAR YOU ARE TIRED AND EVERY BLESSED BOY IS AT THAT STUPID BASEBALL MATCH
3053-148990-0007 WHAT SHALL I DO SIGHED JOSIE PUSHING BACK THE GREAT RED HAT SHE WORE AND GAZING SADLY ROUND HER FOR MORE WORLDS TO CONQUER I'LL PLAY PRESENTLY WHEN I'M A LITTLE COOLER BUT IT IS DULL WORK FOR ME AS I NEVER WIN ANSWERED BESS
3053-148990-0008 FANNING HERSELF WITH A LARGE LEAF JOSIE WAS ABOUT TO SIT DOWN BESIDE HER ON THE RUSTIC SEAT AND WAIT WHEN HER QUICK EYE SAW AFAR OFF TWO MANLY FORMS ARRAYED IN WHITE FLANNEL THEIR BLUE LEGS SEEMED BEARING THEM TOWARDS THE BATTLE GOING ON IN THE DISTANCE
3053-148990-0009 BUT THEY NEVER REACHED THE FRAY FOR WITH A CRY OF JOY JO RACED AWAY TO MEET THEM BENT ON SECURING THIS HEAVEN SENT REINFORCEMENT BOTH PAUSED AS SHE CAME FLYING UP AND BOTH RAISED THEIR HATS BUT OH THE DIFFERENCE THERE WAS IN THE SALUTES
3053-148990-0010 AND PUT IT ON AGAIN AT ONCE AS IF GLAD TO GET THE DUTY OVER THE SLENDER BEING WITH THE CRIMSON TIE LIFTED HIS WITH A GRACEFUL BEND AND HELD IT ALOFT WHILE HE ACCOSTED THE ROSY BREATHLESS MAID THUS PERMITTING HER TO SEE HIS RAVEN LOCKS SMOOTHLY PARTED
3053-148990-0011 WITH ONE LITTLE CURL UPON THE BROW DOLLY PRIDED HIMSELF UPON THAT BOW AND PRACTISED IT BEFORE HIS GLASS BUT DID NOT BESTOW IT UPON ALL ALIKE REGARDING IT AS A WORK OF ART FIT ONLY FOR THE FAIREST AND MOST FAVOURED OF HIS FEMALE ADMIRERS
3053-148990-0012 FOR HE WAS A PRETTY YOUTH AND FANCIED HIMSELF AN ADONIS EAGER JOSIE EVIDENTLY DID NOT APPRECIATE THE HONOUR HE DID HER FOR WITH A NOD SHE BEGGED THEM BOTH TO COME ALONG AND PLAY TENNIS NOT GO AND GET ALL HOT AND DIRTY WITH THE BOYS
3053-148990-0013 THESE TWO ADJECTIVES WON THE DAY FOR STUFFY WAS ALREADY WARMER THAN HE LIKED TO BE AND DOLLY HAD ON A NEW SUIT WHICH HE DESIRED TO KEEP IMMACULATE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS VERY BECOMING
3053-148990-0014 CHARMED TO OBLIGE ANSWERED THE POLITE ONE WITH ANOTHER BEND YOU PLAY I'LL REST ADDED THE FAT BOY
3053-148990-0015 WELL YOU CAN COMFORT BESS FOR I'VE BEATEN HER ALL TO BITS AND SHE NEEDS AMUSING I KNOW YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING NICE IN YOUR POCKET GEORGE GIVE HER SOME AND DOLPHUS CAN HAVE HER RACKET NOW THEN FLY ROUND AND DRIVING HER PREY BEFORE HER
3053-148990-0016 JOSIE RETURNED IN TRIUMPH TO THE COURT CASTING HIMSELF PONDEROUSLY UPON THE BENCH WHICH CREAKED UNDER HIS WEIGHT STUFFY
3053-148990-0017 PROMPTLY PRODUCED THE BOX OF CONFECTIONERY WITHOUT WHICH HE NEVER TRAVELLED FAR AND REGALED BESS WITH CANDIED VIOLETS AND OTHER DAINTIES WHILE DOLLY WORKED HARD TO HOLD HIS OWN AGAINST A MOST ACCOMPLISHED ANTAGONIST HE WOULD HAVE BEATEN HER IF AN UNLUCKY STUMBLE
3053-148990-0018 WHICH PRODUCED AN UNSIGHTLY STAIN UPON THE KNEE OF THOSE NEW SHORTS HAD NOT DISTRACTED HIS MIND AND MADE HIM CARELESS MUCH ELATED AT HER VICTORY JOSIE PERMITTED HIM TO REST AND OFFERED IRONICAL CONSOLATION FOR THE MISHAP WHICH EVIDENTLY WEIGHED UPON HIS MIND
3053-148990-0019 DON'T BE AN OLD BETTY IT CAN BE CLEANED
3053-148990-0020 OR A TAILOR AND LIVED FOR CLOTHES COME NOW DON'T HIT A FELLOW WHEN HE IS DOWN RESPONDED DOLLY FROM THE GRASS WHERE HE AND STUFFY NOW LAY TO MAKE ROOM FOR BOTH GIRLS ON THE SEAT ONE HANDKERCHIEF WAS SPREAD UNDER HIM AND HIS ELBOW LEANED UPON ANOTHER
3053-148990-0021 WHILE HIS EYES WERE SADLY FIXED UPON THE GREEN AND BROWN SPOT WHICH AFFLICTED HIM I LIKE TO BE NEAT DON'T THINK IT CIVIL TO CUT ABOUT IN OLD SHOES AND GREY FLANNEL SHIRTS BEFORE LADIES OUR FELLOWS ARE GENTLEMEN AND DRESS AS SUCH HE ADDED RATHER NETTLED AT THE WORD TAILOR
3053-148990-0022 FOR HE OWED ONE OF THOSE TOO ATTRACTIVE PERSONS AN UNCOMFORTABLY BIG BILL SO ARE OURS BUT GOOD CLOTHES ALONE DON'T MAKE A GENTLEMAN HERE WE REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL MORE FLASHED JOSIE IN ARMS AT ONCE TO DEFEND HER COLLEGE
3053-148990-0023 WHEN YOU AND YOUR FINE GENTLEMEN ARE TWIDDLING YOUR TIES AND SCENTING YOUR HAIR IN OBSCURITY I LIKE OLD BOOTS AND WEAR THEM AND I HATE DANDIES DON'T YOU BESS NOT WHEN THEY ARE KIND TO ME AND BELONG TO OUR OLD SET ANSWERED BESS
3053-148990-0024 WITH A NOD OF THANKS TO DOLLY WHO WAS CAREFULLY REMOVING AN INQUISITIVE CATERPILLAR FROM ONE OF HER LITTLE RUSSET SHOES I LIKE A LADY WHO IS ALWAYS POLITE AND DOESN'T SNAP A MAN'S HEAD OFF IF HE HAS A MIND OF HIS OWN DON'T YOU GEORGE ASKED DOLLY WITH HIS BEST SMILE FOR BESS
3053-148990-0025 A TRANQUIL SNORE WAS STUFFY'S SOLE REPLY AND A GENERAL LAUGH RESTORED PEACE FOR THE MOMENT BUT JOSIE LOVED TO HARASS THE LORDS OF CREATION WHO ASSERTED THEMSELVES TOO MUCH AND BIDED HER TIME FOR ANOTHER ATTACK TILL SHE HAD SECURED MORE TENNIS
3053-148990-0026 SHE GOT ANOTHER GAME FOR DOLLY WAS A SWORN KNIGHT OF DAMES SO HE OBEYED HER CALL LEAVING BESS TO SKETCH GEORGE AS HE LAY UPON HIS BACK HIS STOUT LEGS CROSSED AND HIS ROUND RED FACE PARTIALLY ECLIPSED BY HIS HAT
3053-148990-0027 SO SHE WOKE THE PEACEFUL SLEEPER BY TICKLING HIS NOSE WITH A STRAW TILL HE SNEEZED HIMSELF INTO A SITTING POSTURE AND LOOKED WRATHFULLY ABOUT FOR THAT CONFOUNDED FLY COME SIT UP AND LET US HAVE A LITTLE ELEGANT CONVERSATION
3053-148990-0028 YOU HOWLING SWELLS OUGHT TO IMPROVE OUR MINDS AND MANNERS FOR WE ARE ONLY POOR COUNTRY GIRLS IN DOWDY GOWNS AND HATS BEGAN THE GAD FLY
3053-148990-0029 OPENING THE BATTLE WITH A SLY QUOTATION FROM ONE OF DOLLY'S UNFORTUNATE SPEECHES ABOUT CERTAIN STUDIOUS DAMSELS WHO CARED MORE FOR BOOKS THAN FINERY
3053-148990-0030 YOUR GOWNS ARE ALL RIGHT AND THOSE HATS THE LATEST THING OUT BEGAN POOR DOLPHUS CONVICTING HIMSELF BY THE INCAUTIOUS EXCLAMATION CAUGHT YOU THAT TIME I THOUGHT YOU FELLOWS WERE ALL GENTLEMEN CIVIL AS WELL AS NICE
3053-148990-0031 AND THAT IS A VERY UNMANLY THING TO DO MY MOTHER SAID SO AND JOSIE FELT THAT SHE HAD DEALT A SHREWD BLOW AT THE ELEGANT YOUTH WHO BOWED AT MANY SHRINES IF THEY WERE WELL DECORATED ONES
3053-148990-0032 GOT YOU THERE OLD BOY AND SHE'S RIGHT YOU NEVER HEAR ME TALK ABOUT CLOTHES AND SUCH TWADDLE SAID STUFFY SUPPRESSING A YAWN AND FEELING FOR ANOTHER BON BON WHEREWITH TO REFRESH HIMSELF YOU TALK ABOUT EATING AND THAT IS EVEN WORSE FOR A MAN
3053-148990-0033 YOU WILL MARRY A COOK AND KEEP A RESTAURANT SOME DAY LAUGHED JOSIE DOWN ON HIM AT ONCE THIS FEARFUL PREDICTION KEPT HIM SILENT FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS BUT DOLLY RALLIED AND WISELY CHANGING THE SUBJECT CARRIED WAR INTO THE ENEMY'S CAMP
3053-148990-0034 AS YOU WANTED US TO IMPROVE YOUR MANNERS ALLOW ME TO SAY THAT YOUNG LADIES IN GOOD SOCIETY DON'T MAKE PERSONAL REMARKS OR DELIVER LECTURES LITTLE GIRLS WHO ARE NOT OUT DO IT AND THINK IT WITTY BUT I ASSURE YOU IT'S NOT GOOD FORM
3053-148990-0035 JOSIE PAUSED A MOMENT TO RECOVER FROM THE SHOCK OF BEING CALLED A LITTLE GIRL WHEN ALL THE HONOURS OF HER FOURTEENTH BIRTHDAY WERE FRESH UPON HER AND BESS SAID IN THE LOFTY TONE WHICH WAS INFINITELY MORE CRUSHING THAN JO'S IMPERTINENCE THAT IS TRUE
3053-148990-0036 BUT WE HAVE LIVED ALL OUR LIVES WITH SUPERIOR PEOPLE
3053-148990-0037 WE ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO SENSIBLE CONVERSATION AND HELPING ONE ANOTHER BY TELLING OUR FAULTS THAT WE HAVE NO GOSSIP TO OFFER YOU WHEN THE PRINCESS REPROVED THE BOYS SELDOM RESENTED IT SO DOLLY HELD HIS PEACE AND JOSIE BURST OUT
3053-148990-0038 FOLLOWING HER COUSIN'S LEAD WHICH SHE THOUGHT A HAPPY ONE OUR BOYS LIKE TO HAVE US TALK WITH THEM AND TAKE KINDLY ANY HINTS WE GIVE THEY DON'T THINK THEY KNOW EVERYTHING AND ARE QUITE PERFECT AT EIGHTEEN AS I'VE OBSERVED THE HARVARD MEN DO
3053-148990-0039 ESPECIALLY THE VERY YOUNG ONES JOSIE TOOK IMMENSE SATISFACTION IN THAT RETURN SHOT AND DOLLY SHOWED THAT HE WAS HIT BY THE NETTLED TONE IN WHICH HE ANSWERED
3053-148990-0040 THE CLASS OF FELLOWS YOU HAVE HERE NEED ALL THE POLISH AND CULTURE YOU CAN GIVE THEM AND I'M GLAD THEY GET IT OUR MEN ARE LARGELY FROM THE BEST FAMILIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
3053-148990-0041 THEY VALUE AND USE WELL WHAT COLLEGE GIVES THEM AND AREN'T SATISFIED TO SLIP THROUGH
3053-148990-0042 OH I'VE HEARD YOU MEN TALK AND HEARD YOUR FATHERS SAY THEY WISH THEY HADN'T WASTED TIME AND MONEY JUST THAT YOU MIGHT SAY YOU'D BEEN THROUGH COLLEGE AS FOR THE GIRLS YOU'LL BE MUCH BETTER OFF IN ALL WAYS WHEN THEY DO GET IN AND KEEP YOU LAZY THINGS UP TO THE MARK AS WE DO HERE
3053-148990-0043 WHY DO YOU WEAR OUR COLOUR ASKED DOLLY PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS NOT IMPROVING THE ADVANTAGES HIS ALMA MATER OFFERED HIM BUT BOUND TO DEFEND HER I DON'T MY HAT IS SCARLET NOT CRIMSON MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT A COLOUR SCOFFED JOSIE
3053-148990-0044 I KNOW THAT A CROSS COW WOULD SOON SET YOU SCAMPERING IF YOU FLAUNTED THAT RED TILE UNDER HER NOSE RETORTED DOLLY

3053-148990-0049 SO IT IS WONDER IF SPITFIRE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THESE BEASTLY SPOTS AND DOLLY SAT DOWN TO TRY DRY CLEANSING WITH ONE OF HIS HANDKERCHIEFS ASLEEP HE ASKED AFTER A FEW MOMENTS OF THIS CHEERFUL OCCUPATION
3053-148990-0050 FEARING THAT HIS CHUM MIGHT BE TOO COMFORTABLE WHEN HE WAS IN A FUME HIMSELF NO I WAS THINKING THAT JO WASN'T FAR WRONG ABOUT SHIRKING TIS A SHAME TO GET SO LITTLE DONE WHEN WE OUGHT TO BE GRINDING LIKE MORTON AND TORRY AND THAT LOT

3053-148990-0061 FOR BY VARIOUS HINTS AND SIGNS DURING THE PAST WINTER SHE KNEW THAT THE BOYS WERE BEGINNING TO SEE LIFE IN THE WAY SHE ESPECIALLY DISAPPROVED BOTH WERE FAR FROM HOME HAD MONEY ENOUGH TO WASTE AND WERE AS INEXPERIENCED CURIOUS AND CREDULOUS AS MOST LADS OF THEIR AGE
3053-148990-0062 NOT FOND OF BOOKS THEREFORE WITHOUT THE SAFEGUARD WHICH KEEPS MANY STUDIOUS FELLOWS OUT OF HARM ONE SELF INDULGENT INDOLENT AND SO USED TO LUXURY THAT PAMPERING OF THE SENSES WAS AN EASY THING THE OTHER VAIN AS ALL COMELY BOYS ARE
3053-148990-0063 THESE TRAITS AND FOIBLES MADE BOTH PECULIARLY LIABLE TO THE TEMPTATIONS WHICH ASSAIL PLEASURE LOVING AND WEAK WILLED BOYS MISSUS JO KNEW THEM WELL AND HAD DROPPED MANY A WARNING WORD SINCE THEY WENT TO COLLEGE
3053-148990-0064 BUT TILL LATELY THEY SEEMED NOT TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF HER FRIENDLY HINTS NOW SHE WAS SURE THEY WOULD AND MEANT TO SPEAK OUT FOR LONG EXPERIENCE WITH BOYS MADE HER BOTH BOLD AND SKILFUL IN HANDLING SOME OF THE DANGERS USUALLY LEFT TO SILENCE

3053-148990-0072 STUFFY LOOKED SO SCARED THAT MISSUS JO COULD NOT BE HARD UPON HIS BUDDING SINS FOR THEY LAY AT HIS OVERINDULGENT MOTHER'S DOOR LINE IN A GREAT MEASURE SO SHE SOFTENED THE TONE OF HER VOICE AND ADDED WITH A LITTLE SLAP ON THE FAT HAND
3053-148990-0073 AS SHE USED TO DO WHEN IT WAS SMALL ENOUGH TO PILFER LUMPS OF SUGAR FROM HER BOWL THEN BE CAREFUL FOR A MAN WRITES HIS CHARACTER IN HIS FACE AND YOU DON'T WANT GLUTTONY AND INTEMPERANCE IN YOURS I KNOW I'M SURE I DON'T
3053-148990-0074 PLEASE MAKE OUT A WHOLESOME BILL OF FARE AND I'LL STICK TO IT IF I CAN I AM GETTING STOUT AND I DON'T LIKE IT AND MY LIVER'S TORPID AND I HAVE PALPITATIONS AND HEADACHE

3053-148990-0077 ANSWERED DOLLY BEGINNING BRAVELY QUITE IN THE DARK AS TO WHAT THAT ODD QUESTION MEANT TILL A SUDDEN MEMORY MADE HIM STUTTER AND LOOK AT HIS SHOES WITH DEEP INTEREST OH HE DOESN'T STUDY IT ONLY READS FRENCH NOVELS AND GOES TO THE THEATRE WHEN THE OPERA
3053-148990-0078 INNOCENTLY CONFIRMING MISSUS JO'S SUSPICIONS SO I UNDERSTOOD AND THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT
3053-148990-0079 YOUR MEN WERE OUT IN FULL FORCE AND I WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT SOME OF THE YOUNGER ONES LOOKED AS ASHAMED AS I FELT

3053-148990-0082 WHEN THEY KNOW THE HARM IT DOES IT MADE MY HEART ACHE TO SEE THOSE BOYS WHO OUGHT TO BE AT HOME AND IN THEIR BEDS GOING OFF FOR A NIGHT OF RIOT WHICH WOULD HELP TO RUIN SOME OF THEM FOR EVER
