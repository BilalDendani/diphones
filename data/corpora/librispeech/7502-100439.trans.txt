7502-100439-0000 THE FRIEND OF MAN WHEN SWORDS WENT OUT OF FASHION WALKING STICKS I SUPPOSE CAME INTO FASHION THE PRESENT CUSTOM HAS ITS ADVANTAGES EVEN IN HIS BUSIEST DAY THE HERO'S SWORD MUST HAVE RETURNED AT TIMES TO ITS SCABBARD
7502-100439-0001 AND WHAT WOULD HE DO THEN WITH NOTHING IN HIS RIGHT HAND BUT OUR WALKING STICKS HAVE NO SCABBARDS WE GRASP THEM ALWAYS READY AT ANY MOMENT TO SUMMON A CAB TO POINT OUT A VIEW OR TO DIG AN ENEMY IN THE STOMACH MEANWHILE WE SLASH THE AIR IN DEFIANCE OF THE WORLD
7502-100439-0002 MY FIRST STICK WAS A MALACCA SILVER AT THE COLLAR AND POLISHED HORN AS TO THE HANDLE FOR WEEKS IT LOOKED BESEECHINGLY AT ME FROM A SHOP WINDOW UNTIL A LUCKY BIRTHDAY TIP SENT ME IN AFTER IT WE WENT BACK TO SCHOOL TOGETHER THAT AFTERNOON
7502-100439-0003 OF COURSE IT WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL TO LIVE LONG YET ITS DEATH BECAME IT I HAD LEFT MANY A PARENTAL UMBRELLA IN THE TRAIN UNHONOURED AND UNSUNG MY MALACCA WAS MISLAID IN AN HOTEL IN NORWAY
7502-100439-0004 WHAT TIME TRAVELLERS TELL TO AWESTRUCK STAY AT HOMES TALES OF ADVENTURE IN DISTANT LANDS EVEN NOW IF BY A LUCKY CHANCE NORWAY IS MENTIONED I TAP THE LOGS CARELESSLY WITH THE POKER AND DRAWL I SUPPOSE YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN TO STAY AT VOSSVANGEN
7502-100439-0005 I LEFT A MALACCA CANE THERE ONCE RATHER A GOOD ONE TOO
7502-100439-0006 MY LAST IS OF EBONY IVORY TOPPED
7502-100439-0007 I COULD NOT TAKE THIS STICK WITH ME IT IS NOT A STICK FOR THE COUNTRY ITS HEART IS IN PICCADILLY PERHAPS IT MIGHT THRIVE IN PARIS IF IT COULD STAND THE SEA VOYAGE BUT NO I CANNOT SEE IT CROSSING THE CHANNEL IN A CAP I AM NO COMPANION FOR IT
7502-100439-0008 COULD I STEP ON TO THE BOAT IN A SILK HAT AND THEN RETIRE BELOW BUT I AM ALWAYS UNWELL BELOW AND THAT WOULD NOT SUIT ITS DIGNITY IT STANDS NOW IN A CORNER OF MY ROOM CRYING ALOUD TO BE TAKEN TO THE OPERA I USED TO DISLIKE MEN WHO TOOK CANES TO COVENT GARDEN
7502-100439-0009 BUT I SEE NOW HOW IT MUST HAVE BEEN WITH THEM AN EBONY STICK TOPPED WITH IVORY HAS TO BE HUMOURED ALREADY I AM CONSIDERING A SILK LINED CAPE AND IT IS SETTLED THAT MY GLOVES ARE TO HAVE BLACK STITCHINGS SUCH IS MY LAST STICK
7502-100439-0010 FOR IT WAS GIVEN TO ME THIS VERY MORNING AT MY FIRST SIGHT OF IT I THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT REPLACE THE COMMON ONE WHICH I LOST IN AN EASTER TRAIN THAT WAS SILLY OF ME I MUST HAVE A STICK OF LESS GENTLE BIRTH WHICH IS NOT AFRAID TO BE SEEN WITH A SOFT HAT
7502-100439-0011 ONE WITH WHICH I CAN SLASH DANDELIONS ONE FOR WHICH WHEN ULTIMATELY I LEAVE IT IN A TRAIN CONSCIENCE DOES NOT DRAG ME TO SCOTLAND YARD IN SHORT A COMPANIONABLE STICK FOR A DAY'S JOURNEY A COUNTRY STICK
7502-100439-0012 THE IDEAL COUNTRY STICK WILL NEVER BE FOUND IT MUST BE THICK ENOUGH TO STAND MUCH ROUGH USAGE OF A SORT WHICH I WILL EXPLAIN PRESENTLY AND YET IT MUST BE THIN SO THAT IT MAKES A PLEASANT WHISTLING SOUND THROUGH THE AIR
7502-100439-0013 OR PULL UP THE LUNCHEON BASKET WHICH YOU WANT EVEN MORE BADLY
7502-100439-0014 IT MUST BE UNADORNED SO THAT IT SHALL LACK OSTENTATION AND YET IT MUST HAVE A BAND SO THAT WHEN YOU THROW STONES AT IT YOU CAN COUNT TWO IF YOU HIT THE SILVER YOU BEGIN TO SEE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO ACHIEVE THE PERFECT STICK WELL
7502-100439-0015 EACH ONE OF US MUST LET GO THOSE PROPERTIES WHICH HIS OWN STICK CAN DO BEST WITHOUT FOR MYSELF I INSIST ON THIS MY STICK MUST BE GOOD FOR HITTING AND GOOD TO HIT WITH A STICK WE ARE AGREED IS SOMETHING TO HAVE IN THE HAND WHEN WALKING
7502-100439-0016 BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE SIT DOWN AND IF OUR JOURNEY SHALL HAVE TAKEN US TO THE BEACH OUR STICK MUST AT ONCE BE PROPPED IN THE SAND WHILE FROM A SUITABLE DISTANCE WE THROW STONES AT IT HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL THE SEA ITS BEAUTY CAN ONLY BE APPRECIATED PROPERLY IN THIS FASHION
7502-100439-0017 WE MUST ABSORB IT UNCONSCIOUSLY WITH THE MIND GENTLY EXERCISED AS TO WHETHER WE SCORED A TWO ON THE BAND OR A ONE JUST BELOW IT AND WITH THE MUSCLES OF THE ARM AT STRETCH WE ARE IN A STATE IDEALLY RECEPTIVE OF BEAUTY AND FOR MY OTHER ESSENTIAL OF A COUNTRY STICK
7502-100439-0018 IT MUST BE POSSIBLE TO GRASP IT BY THE WRONG END AND HIT A BALL WITH IT SO IT MUST HAVE NO FERRULE AND THE HANDLE MUST BE HEAVY AND STRAIGHT
7502-100439-0019 CHIEFLY WE WANT A STICK FOR LEANING ON WHEN WE ARE TALKING TO AN ACQUAINTANCE SUDDENLY MET AFTER THE INITIAL HULLOA AND THE DISCOVERY THAT WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE OF IMPORTANCE TO SAY THE SITUATION IS DISTINCTLY EASED BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF OUR STICK IT GIVES US A SUPPORT MORAL AND PHYSICAL
7502-100439-0020 SUCH AS IS SUPPLIED IN A DRAWING ROOM BY A CIGARETTE FOR THIS PURPOSE SIZE AND SHAPE ARE IMMATERIAL YET THIS MUCH IS ESSENTIAL IT MUST NOT BE TOO SLIPPERY OR IN OUR NERVOUSNESS WE MAY DROP IT ALTOGETHER MY EBONY STICK WITH THE POLISHED IVORY TOP
