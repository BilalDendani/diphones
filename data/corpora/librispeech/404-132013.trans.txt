404-132013-0003 WITH SOFT FEATURES AND POLISHED MANNERS WHO EVIDENTLY CONSIDERED HIMSELF A CELEBRITY BUT OUT OF POLITENESS MODESTLY PLACED HIMSELF AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE CIRCLE IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF
404-132013-0004 ANNA PAVLOVNA WAS OBVIOUSLY SERVING HIM UP AS A TREAT TO HER GUESTS AS A CLEVER MAITRE D'HOTEL SERVES UP AS A SPECIALLY CHOICE DELICACY A PIECE OF MEAT THAT NO ONE WHO HAD SEEN IT IN THE KITCHEN WOULD HAVE CARED TO EAT
404-132013-0005 SO ANNA PAVLOVNA SERVED UP TO HER GUESTS FIRST THE VICOMTE AND THEN THE ABBE AS PECULIARLY CHOICE MORSELS THE GROUP ABOUT MORTEMART IMMEDIATELY BEGAN DISCUSSING THE MURDER OF THE DUC D'ENGHIEN
404-132013-0006 THE VICOMTE SAID THAT THE DUC D'ENGHIEN HAD PERISHED BY HIS OWN MAGNANIMITY AND THAT THERE WERE PARTICULAR REASONS FOR BUONAPARTE'S HATRED OF HIM AH YES DO TELL US ALL ABOUT IT VICOMTE SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA
404-132013-0007 THE VICOMTE BOWED AND SMILED COURTEOUSLY IN TOKEN OF HIS WILLINGNESS TO COMPLY ANNA PAVLOVNA ARRANGED A GROUP ROUND HIM INVITING EVERYONE TO LISTEN TO HIS TALE
404-132013-0008 THE VICOMTE KNEW THE DUC PERSONALLY WHISPERED ANNA PAVLOVNA TO ONE OF THE GUESTS THE VICOMTE IS A WONDERFUL RACONTEUR SAID SHE TO ANOTHER HOW EVIDENTLY HE BELONGS TO THE BEST SOCIETY
404-132013-0009 AND THE VICOMTE WAS SERVED UP TO THE COMPANY IN THE CHOICEST AND MOST ADVANTAGEOUS STYLE LIKE A WELL GARNISHED JOINT OF ROAST BEEF ON A HOT DISH THE VICOMTE WISHED TO BEGIN HIS STORY AND GAVE A SUBTLE SMILE
404-132013-0010 COME OVER HERE HELENE DEAR SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA TO THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG PRINCESS WHO WAS SITTING SOME WAY OFF THE CENTER OF ANOTHER GROUP THE PRINCESS SMILED SHE ROSE WITH THE SAME UNCHANGING SMILE WITH WHICH SHE HAD FIRST ENTERED THE ROOM
404-132013-0011 THE SMILE OF A PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
404-132013-0012 SHE PASSED BETWEEN THE MEN WHO MADE WAY FOR HER NOT LOOKING AT ANY OF THEM BUT SMILING ON ALL AS IF GRACIOUSLY ALLOWING EACH THE PRIVILEGE OF ADMIRING HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND SHAPELY SHOULDERS BACK AND BOSOM
404-132013-0013 WHICH IN THE FASHION OF THOSE DAYS WERE VERY MUCH EXPOSED AND SHE SEEMED TO BRING THE GLAMOUR OF A BALLROOM WITH HER AS SHE MOVED TOWARD ANNA PAVLOVNA HELENE WAS SO LOVELY THAT NOT ONLY DID SHE NOT SHOW ANY TRACE OF COQUETRY
404-132013-0014 BUT ON THE CONTRARY SHE EVEN APPEARED SHY OF HER UNQUESTIONABLE AND ALL TOO VICTORIOUS BEAUTY SHE SEEMED TO WISH BUT TO BE UNABLE TO DIMINISH ITS EFFECT
404-132013-0015 AND THE VICOMTE LIFTED HIS SHOULDERS AND DROPPED HIS EYES AS IF STARTLED BY SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY WHEN SHE TOOK HER SEAT OPPOSITE AND BEAMED UPON HIM ALSO WITH HER UNCHANGING SMILE MADAME I DOUBT MY ABILITY BEFORE SUCH AN AUDIENCE
404-132013-0016 THE PRINCESS RESTED HER BARE ROUND ARM ON A LITTLE TABLE AND CONSIDERED A REPLY UNNECESSARY SHE SMILINGLY WAITED ALL THE TIME THE STORY WAS BEING TOLD SHE SAT UPRIGHT GLANCING NOW AT HER BEAUTIFUL ROUND ARM
404-132013-0017 NOW AT HER STILL MORE BEAUTIFUL BOSOM ON WHICH SHE READJUSTED A DIAMOND NECKLACE
404-132013-0018 AND WHENEVER THE STORY PRODUCED AN EFFECT SHE GLANCED AT ANNA PAVLOVNA AT ONCE ADOPTED JUST THE EXPRESSION SHE SAW ON THE MAID OF HONOR'S FACE AND AGAIN RELAPSED INTO HER RADIANT SMILE
404-132013-0019 THE LITTLE PRINCESS HAD ALSO LEFT THE TEA TABLE AND FOLLOWED HELENE WAIT A MOMENT I'LL GET MY WORK
404-132013-0020 THERE WAS A GENERAL MOVEMENT AS THE PRINCESS SMILING AND TALKING MERRILY TO EVERYONE AT ONCE SAT DOWN AND GAILY ARRANGED HERSELF IN HER SEAT NOW I AM ALL RIGHT SHE SAID AND ASKING THE VICOMTE TO BEGIN SHE TOOK UP HER WORK
404-132013-0021 PRINCE HIPPOLYTE HAVING BROUGHT THE WORKBAG JOINED THE CIRCLE AND MOVING A CHAIR CLOSE TO HERS SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE HER LE CHARMANT HIPPOLYTE WAS SURPRISING BY HIS EXTRAORDINARY RESEMBLANCE TO HIS BEAUTIFUL SISTER BUT YET MORE
404-132013-0022 BY THE FACT THAT IN SPITE OF THIS RESEMBLANCE HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY UGLY HIS FEATURES WERE LIKE HIS SISTER'S BUT WHILE IN HER CASE EVERYTHING WAS LIT UP BY A JOYOUS SELF SATISFIED YOUTHFUL AND CONSTANT SMILE OF ANIMATION
404-132013-0023 AND BY THE WONDERFUL CLASSIC BEAUTY OF HER FIGURE HIS FACE ON THE CONTRARY WAS DULLED BY IMBECILITY AND A CONSTANT EXPRESSION OF SULLEN SELF CONFIDENCE WHILE HIS BODY WAS THIN AND WEAK HIS EYES NOSE AND MOUTH
404-132013-0024 ALL SEEMED PUCKERED INTO A VACANT WEARIED GRIMACE AND HIS ARMS AND LEGS ALWAYS FELL INTO UNNATURAL POSITIONS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A GHOST STORY
404-132013-0025 AND HASTILY ADJUSTING HIS LORGNETTE AS IF WITHOUT THIS INSTRUMENT HE COULD NOT BEGIN TO SPEAK WHY NO MY DEAR FELLOW SAID THE ASTONISHED NARRATOR SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS BECAUSE I HATE GHOST STORIES SAID PRINCE HIPPOLYTE IN A TONE WHICH SHOWED
404-132013-0026 THAT HE ONLY UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF HIS WORDS AFTER HE HAD UTTERED THEM HE SPOKE WITH SUCH SELF CONFIDENCE THAT HIS HEARERS COULD NOT BE SURE WHETHER WHAT HE SAID WAS VERY WITTY OR VERY STUPID
404-132013-0027 HE WAS DRESSED IN A DARK GREEN DRESS COAT KNEE BREECHES OF THE COLOR
404-132013-0028 AS HE CALLED IT SHOES AND SILK STOCKINGS THE VICOMTE TOLD HIS TALE VERY NEATLY IT WAS AN ANECDOTE THEN CURRENT TO THE EFFECT THAT THE DUC D'ENGHIEN HAD GONE SECRETLY TO PARIS TO VISIT MADEMOISELLE GEORGE
404-132013-0029 THAT AT HER HOUSE HE CAME UPON BONAPARTE
404-132013-0030 AND THAT IN HIS PRESENCE NAPOLEON HAPPENED TO FALL INTO ONE OF THE FAINTING FITS TO WHICH HE WAS SUBJECT AND WAS THUS AT THE DUC'S MERCY THE LATTER SPARED HIM AND THIS MAGNANIMITY BONAPARTE SUBSEQUENTLY REPAID BY DEATH
404-132013-0031 THE STORY WAS VERY PRETTY AND INTERESTING ESPECIALLY AT THE POINT WHERE THE RIVALS SUDDENLY RECOGNIZED ONE ANOTHER AND THE LADIES LOOKED AGITATED CHARMING SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA
404-132013-0032 CHARMING WHISPERED THE LITTLE PRINCESS STICKING THE NEEDLE INTO HER WORK AS IF TO TESTIFY THAT THE INTEREST AND FASCINATION OF THE STORY PREVENTED HER FROM GOING ON WITH IT THE VICOMTE APPRECIATED THIS SILENT PRAISE
404-132013-0033 AND SMILING GRATEFULLY PREPARED TO CONTINUE BUT JUST THEN ANNA PAVLOVNA WHO HAD KEPT A WATCHFUL EYE ON THE YOUNG MAN WHO SO ALARMED HER NOTICED THAT HE WAS TALKING TOO LOUDLY AND VEHEMENTLY WITH THE ABBE SO SHE HURRIED TO THE RESCUE
404-132013-0034 PIERRE HAD MANAGED TO START A CONVERSATION WITH THE ABBE ABOUT THE BALANCE OF POWER AND THE LATTER EVIDENTLY INTERESTED BY THE YOUNG MAN'S SIMPLE MINDED EAGERNESS WAS EXPLAINING HIS PET THEORY
404-132013-0035 BOTH WERE TALKING AND LISTENING TOO EAGERLY AND TOO NATURALLY WHICH WAS WHY ANNA PAVLOVNA DISAPPROVED THE MEANS ARE THE BALANCE OF POWER IN EUROPE AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE THE ABBE WAS SAYING
404-132013-0036 IT IS ONLY NECESSARY FOR ONE POWERFUL NATION LIKE RUSSIA BARBARIC AS SHE IS SAID TO BE TO PLACE HERSELF DISINTERESTEDLY AT THE HEAD OF AN ALLIANCE
404-132013-0037 AND IT WOULD SAVE THE WORLD BUT HOW ARE YOU TO GET THAT BALANCE PIERRE WAS BEGINNING AT THAT MOMENT ANNA PAVLOVNA CAME UP AND LOOKING SEVERELY AT PIERRE ASKED THE ITALIAN HOW HE STOOD RUSSIAN CLIMATE
404-132013-0038 THE ITALIAN'S FACE INSTANTLY CHANGED AND ASSUMED AN OFFENSIVELY AFFECTED SUGARY EXPRESSION EVIDENTLY HABITUAL TO HIM WHEN CONVERSING WITH WOMEN I AM SO ENCHANTED BY THE BRILLIANCY OF THE WIT AND CULTURE OF THE SOCIETY
404-132013-0039 MORE ESPECIALLY OF THE FEMININE SOCIETY
404-132013-0040 THAT I HAVE NOT YET HAD TIME TO THINK OF THE CLIMATE
404-132013-0041 ANNA PAVLOVNA THE MORE CONVENIENTLY TO KEEP THEM UNDER OBSERVATION
