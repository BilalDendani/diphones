4945-29091-0000 CHAPTER TEN ONLY TWO OR THREE DAYS HAD ELAPSED SINCE THE FUNERAL WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENED WHICH WAS TO CHANGE THE DRIFT OF LAURA'S LIFE SOMEWHAT AND INFLUENCE IN A GREATER OR LESSER DEGREE THE FORMATION OF HER CHARACTER
4945-29091-0001 MAJOR LACKLAND HAD ONCE BEEN A MAN OF NOTE IN THE STATE A MAN OF EXTRAORDINARY NATURAL ABILITY AND AS EXTRAORDINARY LEARNING HE HAD BEEN UNIVERSALLY TRUSTED AND HONORED IN HIS DAY
4945-29091-0002 BUT HAD FINALLY FALLEN INTO MISFORTUNE WHILE SERVING HIS THIRD TERM IN CONGRESS AND WHILE UPON THE POINT OF BEING ELEVATED TO THE SENATE WHICH WAS CONSIDERED THE SUMMIT OF EARTHLY AGGRANDIZEMENT IN THOSE DAYS HE HAD YIELDED TO TEMPTATION
4945-29091-0003 WHEN IN DISTRESS FOR MONEY WHEREWITH TO SAVE HIS ESTATE AND SOLD HIS VOTE HIS CRIME WAS DISCOVERED AND HIS FALL FOLLOWED INSTANTLY NOTHING COULD REINSTATE HIM IN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE HIS RUIN WAS IRRETRIEVABLE
4945-29091-0004 HIS DISGRACE COMPLETE ALL DOORS WERE CLOSED AGAINST HIM ALL MEN AVOIDED HIM AFTER YEARS OF SKULKING RETIREMENT AND DISSIPATION DEATH HAD RELIEVED HIM OF HIS TROUBLES AT LAST
4945-29091-0005 WHICH REVEALED A FACT NOT SUSPECTED BY THE VILLAGERS BEFORE VIZ THAT LAURA WAS NOT THE CHILD OF MISTER AND MISSUS HAWKINS THE GOSSIPS WERE SOON AT WORK
4945-29091-0006 THE GOSSIPS SEEMED TO GAIN ALL THE MORE FREEDOM FROM IT THEY SUPPLIED ALL THE MISSING INFORMATION THEMSELVES THEY FILLED UP ALL THE BLANKS THE TOWN SOON TEEMED WITH HISTORIES OF LAURA'S ORIGIN AND SECRET HISTORY NO TWO VERSIONS PRECISELY ALIKE
4945-29091-0007 LAURA BEGAN TO ENCOUNTER COLD LOOKS AVERTED EYES AND PECULIAR NODS AND GESTURES WHICH PERPLEXED HER BEYOND MEASURE BUT PRESENTLY THE PERVADING GOSSIP FOUND ITS WAY TO HER
4945-29091-0008 BUT UPON SECOND THOUGHT HELD HER PEACE SHE SOON GATHERED THAT MAJOR LACKLAND'S MEMORANDA SEEMED TO REFER TO LETTERS WHICH HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIMSELF AND JUDGE HAWKINS SHE SHAPED HER COURSE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THE DAY THAT THAT HINT REACHED HER
4945-29091-0009 THAT NIGHT SHE SAT IN HER ROOM TILL ALL WAS STILL AND THEN SHE STOLE INTO THE GARRET AND BEGAN A SEARCH SHE RUMMAGED LONG AMONG BOXES OF MUSTY PAPERS RELATING TO BUSINESS MATTERS OF NO INTEREST TO HER
4945-29091-0010 BUT AT LAST SHE FOUND SEVERAL BUNDLES OF LETTERS ONE BUNDLE WAS MARKED PRIVATE AND IN THAT SHE FOUND WHAT SHE WANTED SHE SELECTED SIX OR EIGHT LETTERS FROM THE PACKAGE AND BEGAN TO DEVOUR THEIR CONTENTS
4945-29091-0011 HEEDLESS OF THE COLD BY THE DATES THESE LETTERS WERE FROM FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS OLD THEY WERE ALL FROM MAJOR LACKLAND TO MISTER HAWKINS
4945-29091-0012 THE SUBSTANCE OF THEM WAS THAT SOME ONE IN THE EAST HAD BEEN INQUIRING OF MAJOR LACKLAND ABOUT A LOST CHILD AND ITS PARENTS AND THAT IT WAS CONJECTURED THAT THE CHILD MIGHT BE LAURA
4945-29091-0013 ANOTHER LETTER SAID THAT THE POOR SOUL BROKE COMPLETELY DOWN WHEN HE SAW LAURA'S PICTURE AND DECLARED IT MUST BE SHE STILL ANOTHER SAID
4945-29091-0014 HE WAS CLINGING TO THE STARBOARD WHEEL OF THE BURNING WRECK AT THE TIME A FALLING TIMBER STRUCK HIM ON THE HEAD BUT I WILL WRITE OUT HIS WONDERFUL ESCAPE IN FULL TO MORROW OR NEXT DAY OF COURSE
4945-29091-0015 THE PHYSICIANS WILL NOT LET ME TELL HIM NOW THAT OUR LAURA IS INDEED HIS CHILD THAT MUST COME LATER WHEN HIS HEALTH IS THOROUGHLY RESTORED HIS CASE IS NOT CONSIDERED DANGEROUS AT ALL HE WILL RECOVER PRESENTLY THE DOCTORS SAY
4945-29091-0016 BUT THEY INSIST THAT HE MUST TRAVEL A LITTLE WHEN HE GETS WELL THEY RECOMMEND A SHORT SEA VOYAGE AND THEY SAY HE CAN BE PERSUADED TO TRY IT IF WE CONTINUE TO KEEP HIM IN IGNORANCE AND PROMISE TO LET HIM SEE L AS SOON AS HE RETURNS
4945-29091-0017 THE LETTER THAT BORE THE LATEST DATE OF ALL CONTAINED THIS CLAUSE IT IS THE MOST UNACCOUNTABLE THING IN THE WORLD THE MYSTERY REMAINS AS IMPENETRABLE AS EVER
4945-29091-0018 I HAVE HUNTED HIGH AND LOW FOR HIM AND INQUIRED OF EVERYBODY BUT IN VAIN ALL TRACE OF HIM ENDS AT THAT HOTEL IN NEW YORK I NEVER HAVE SEEN OR HEARD OF HIM SINCE UP TO THIS DAY HE COULD HARDLY HAVE SAILED
4945-29091-0019 FOR HIS NAME DOES NOT APPEAR UPON THE BOOKS OF ANY SHIPPING OFFICE IN NEW YORK OR BOSTON OR BALTIMORE HOW FORTUNATE IT SEEMS NOW THAT WE KEPT THIS THING TO OURSELVES LAURA STILL HAS A FATHER IN YOU
4945-29091-0020 THAT WAS ALL RANDOM REMARKS HERE AND THERE BEING PIECED TOGETHER GAVE LAURA A VAGUE IMPRESSION OF A MAN OF FINE PRESENCE ABOUT FORTY THREE OR FORTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE
4945-29091-0021 WITH DARK HAIR AND EYES AND A SLIGHT LIMP IN HIS WALK IT WAS NOT STATED WHICH LEG WAS DEFECTIVE AND THIS INDISTINCT SHADOW REPRESENTED HER FATHER
4945-29091-0022 SHE MADE AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH FOR THE MISSING LETTERS BUT FOUND NONE THEY HAD PROBABLY BEEN BURNED AND SHE DOUBTED NOT THAT THE ONES SHE HAD FERRETED OUT WOULD HAVE SHARED THE SAME FATE IF MISTER HAWKINS HAD NOT BEEN A DREAMER VOID OF METHOD
4945-29091-0023 WHOSE MIND WAS PERHAPS IN A STATE OF CONFLAGRATION OVER SOME BRIGHT NEW SPECULATION WHEN HE RECEIVED THEM SHE SAT LONG WITH THE LETTERS IN HER LAP THINKING AND UNCONSCIOUSLY FREEZING
4945-29091-0024 THE AGE WHEN THERE IS A SAD SWEETNESS A DISMAL COMFORT TO A GIRL TO FIND OUT THAT THERE IS A MYSTERY CONNECTED WITH HER BIRTH WHICH NO OTHER PIECE OF GOOD LUCK CAN AFFORD
4945-29091-0025 ONE NEVER CEASES TO MAKE A HERO OF ONE'S SELF IN PRIVATE DURING LIFE BUT ONLY ALTERS THE STYLE OF HIS HEROISM FROM TIME TO TIME AS THE DRIFTING YEARS BELITTLE CERTAIN GODS OF HIS ADMIRATION AND RAISE UP OTHERS IN THEIR STEAD THAT SEEM GREATER
4945-29091-0026 THE RECENT WEARING DAYS AND NIGHTS OF WATCHING AND THE WASTING GRIEF THAT HAD POSSESSED HER COMBINED WITH THE PROFOUND DEPRESSION THAT NATURALLY CAME WITH THE REACTION OF IDLENESS MADE LAURA PECULIARLY SUSCEPTIBLE AT THIS TIME
4945-29091-0027 TO ROMANTIC IMPRESSIONS SHE WAS A HEROINE NOW WITH A MYSTERIOUS FATHER SOMEWHERE SHE COULD NOT REALLY TELL WHETHER SHE WANTED TO FIND HIM AND SPOIL IT ALL OR NOT BUT STILL
4945-29091-0028 AS THE USUAL AND NECESSARY COURSE TO FOLLOW THEREFORE SHE WOULD SOME DAY BEGIN THE SEARCH WHEN OPPORTUNITY SHOULD OFFER NOW A FORMER THOUGHT STRUCK HER SHE WOULD SPEAK TO MISSUS HAWKINS AND NATURALLY ENOUGH
4945-29091-0029 THEY WOULD NEVER END HER DAUGHTER'S LOVE WOULD WEAN ITSELF AWAY FROM HER AND HER HEART WOULD BREAK HER GRIEF SO WROUGHT UPON LAURA THAT THE GIRL ALMOST FORGOT HER OWN TROUBLES FOR THE MOMENT IN HER COMPASSION FOR HER MOTHER'S DISTRESS
4945-29091-0030 FINALLY MISSUS HAWKINS SAID SPEAK TO ME CHILD DO NOT FORSAKE ME FORGET ALL THIS MISERABLE TALK SAY I AM YOUR MOTHER I HAVE LOVED YOU SO LONG AND THERE IS NO OTHER I AM YOUR MOTHER IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND NOTHING SHALL EVER TAKE YOU FROM ME
4945-29091-0031 AND NEITHER THIS FOOLISH TALK NOR ANY OTHER THING SHALL PART US OR MAKE US LESS TO EACH OTHER THAN WE ARE THIS HOUR THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY SENSE OF SEPARATION OR ESTRANGEMENT BETWEEN THEM INDEED
4945-29091-0032 THE GREAT SECRET WAS NEW TO SOME OF THE YOUNGER CHILDREN BUT THEIR LOVE SUFFERED NO CHANGE UNDER THE WONDERFUL REVELATION IT IS BARELY POSSIBLE THAT THINGS MIGHT HAVE PRESENTLY SETTLED DOWN INTO THEIR OLD RUT
4945-29091-0033 OSTENSIBLY UPON VISITS OF CONDOLENCE AND THEY PUMPED AWAY AT THE MOTHER AND THE CHILDREN WITHOUT SEEMING TO KNOW THAT THEIR QUESTIONINGS WERE IN BAD TASTE THEY MEANT NO HARM THEY ONLY WANTED TO KNOW
4945-29091-0034 VILLAGERS ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW THE FAMILY FOUGHT SHY OF THE QUESTIONINGS AND OF COURSE THAT WAS HIGH TESTIMONY IF THE DUCHESS WAS RESPECTABLY BORN WHY DIDN'T THEY COME OUT AND PROVE IT
4945-29091-0035 WHY DID THEY STICK TO THAT POOR THIN STORY ABOUT PICKING HER UP OUT OF A STEAMBOAT EXPLOSION UNDER THIS CEASELESS PERSECUTION LAURA'S MORBID SELF COMMUNING WAS RENEWED
4945-29091-0036 AT NIGHT THE DAY'S CONTRIBUTION OF DETRACTION INNUENDO AND MALICIOUS CONJECTURE WOULD BE CANVASSED IN HER MIND AND THEN SHE WOULD DRIFT INTO A COURSE OF THINKING AS HER THOUGHTS RAN ON THE INDIGNANT TEARS WOULD SPRING TO HER EYES
4945-29091-0037 AND SHE WOULD SPIT OUT FIERCE LITTLE EJACULATIONS AT INTERVALS BUT FINALLY SHE WOULD GROW CALMER AND SAY SOME COMFORTING DISDAINFUL THING SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT WHO ARE THEY ANIMALS
4945-29091-0038 LET THEM TALK I WILL NOT STOOP TO BE AFFECTED BY IT I COULD HATE NONSENSE NOBODY I CARE FOR OR IN ANY WAY RESPECT IS CHANGED TOWARD ME I FANCY
4945-29091-0039 ONE DAY A FRIEND OVERHEARD A CONVERSATION LIKE THIS AND NATURALLY CAME AND TOLD HER ALL ABOUT IT NED THEY SAY YOU DON'T GO THERE ANY MORE HOW IS THAT
4945-29091-0040 BUT YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WHEN A GIRL ONCE GETS TALKED ABOUT IT'S ALL UP WITH HER THE WORLD WON'T EVER LET HER ALONE AFTER THAT THE ONLY COMMENT LAURA MADE UPON THIS REVELATION WAS THEN IT APPEARS THAT IF THIS TROUBLE HAD NOT OCCURRED
4945-29091-0041 HE IS WELL FAVORED IN PERSON AND WELL LIKED TOO I BELIEVE AND COMES OF ONE OF THE FIRST FAMILIES OF THE VILLAGE HE IS PROSPEROUS TOO I HEAR HAS BEEN A DOCTOR A YEAR NOW AND HAS HAD TWO PATIENTS NO THREE I THINK
4945-29091-0042 I'M GLAD OF IT I NEVER CARED ANYTHING FOR HIM ANYWAY
