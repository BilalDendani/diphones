3470-116550-0000 HE BECOMETH THE ARROW FROM THE BOW OF DOROZHAND HURLED FORWARD AT A MARK HE MAY NOT SEE TO THE GOAL OF DOROZHAND BEYOND THE THINKING OF MEN BEYOND THE SIGHT OF ALL THE OTHER GODS REGARD THE EYES OF DOROZHAND
3470-116550-0001 HE HATH CHOSEN HIS SLAVES AND THEM DOTH THE DESTINY GOD DRIVE ONWARD WHERE HE WILL WHO KNOWING NOT WHITHER NOR EVEN KNOWING WHY FEEL ONLY HIS SCOURGE BEHIND THEM OR HEAR HIS CRY BEFORE
3470-116550-0002 THERE IS SOMETHING THAT DOROZHAND WOULD FAIN ACHIEVE AND THEREFORE HATH HE SET THE PEOPLE STRIVING WITH NONE TO CEASE OR REST IN ALL THE WORLDS BUT THE GODS OF PEGANA SPEAKING TO THE GODS SAY
3470-116550-0003 WHAT IS IT THAT DOROZHAND WOULD FAIN ACHIEVE IT HATH BEEN WRITTEN AND SAID THAT NOT ONLY THE DESTINIES OF MEN ARE THE CARE OF DOROZHAND BUT THAT EVEN THE GODS OF PEGANA BE NOT UNCONCERNED BY HIS WILL
3470-116550-0004 ALL THE GODS OF PEGANA HAVE FELT A FEAR FOR THEY HAVE SEEN A LOOK IN THE EYES OF DOROZHAND THAT REGARDETH BEYOND THE GODS THE REASON AND PURPOSE OF THE WORLDS IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE LIFE UPON THE WORLDS
3470-116550-0005 AND LIFE IS THE INSTRUMENT OF DOROZHAND WHEREWITH HE WOULD ACHIEVE HIS END THEREFORE THE WORLDS GO ON AND THE RIVERS RUN TO THE SEA
3470-116550-0006 AND THE GODS OF PEGANA DO THE WORK OF THE GODS AND ALL FOR DOROZHAND BUT WHEN THE END OF DOROZHAND HATH BEEN ACHIEVED THERE WILL BE NEED NO LONGER OF LIFE UPON THE WORLDS NOR ANY MORE A GAME FOR THE SMALL GODS TO PLAY THEN WILL KIB
3470-116550-0007 TIPTOE GENTLY ACROSS PEGANA TO THE RESTING PLACE IN HIGHEST PEGANA OF MANA YOOD SUSHAI AND TOUCHING REVERENTLY HIS HAND THE HAND THAT WROUGHT THE GODS SAY MANA YOOD SUSHAI THOU HAST RESTED LONG
3470-116550-0008 AND MANA YOOD SUSHAI SHALL SAY NOT SO
3470-116550-0009 AND THEN SHALL THE GODS BE AFRAID WHEN THEY FIND THAT MANA KNOWETH THAT THEY HAVE MADE WORLDS WHILE HE RESTED AND THEY SHALL ANSWER NAY BUT THE WORLDS CAME ALL OF THEMSELVES THEN MANA YOOD SUSHAI
3470-116550-0010 AS ONE WHO WOULD HAVE DONE WITH AN IRKSOME MATTER WILL LIGHTLY WAVE HIS HAND THE HAND THAT WROUGHT THE GODS AND THERE SHALL BE GODS NO MORE WHEN THERE SHALL BE THREE MOONS TOWARDS THE NORTH ABOVE THE STAR OF THE ABIDING
3470-116550-0011 THREE MOONS THAT NEITHER WAX NOR WANE BUT REGARD TOWARDS THE NORTH OR WHEN THE COMET CEASETH FROM HIS SEEKING AND STANDS STILL NOT ANY LONGER MOVING AMONG THE WORLDS BUT TARRYING AS ONE WHO RESTS AFTER THE END OF SEARCH
3470-116550-0012 THEN SHALL ARISE FROM RESTING BECAUSE IT IS THE END THE GREATER ONE WHO RESTED OF OLD TIME EVEN MANA YOOD SUSHAI THEN SHALL THE TIMES THAT WERE BE TIMES NO MORE
3470-116550-0013 AND IT MAY BE THAT THE OLD DEAD DAYS SHALL RETURN FROM BEYOND THE RIM AND WE WHO HAVE WEPT FOR THEM SHALL SEE THOSE DAYS AGAIN AS ONE WHO RETURNING FROM LONG TRAVEL TO HIS HOME COMES SUDDENLY ON DEAR REMEMBERED THINGS
3470-116550-0014 FOR NONE SHALL KNOW OF MANA WHO HATH RESTED FOR SO LONG WHETHER HE BE A HARSH OR MERCIFUL GOD IT MAY BE THAT HE SHALL HAVE MERCY AND THAT THESE THINGS SHALL BE THE EYE IN THE WASTE
3470-116550-0015 THERE LIE SEVEN DESERTS BEYOND BODRAHAN WHICH IS THE CITY OF THE CARAVANS END NONE GOETH BEYOND IN THE FIRST DESERT LIE THE TRACKS OF MIGHTY TRAVELLERS OUTWARD FROM BODRAHAN AND SOME RETURNING
3470-116550-0016 AND IN THE SECOND LIE ONLY OUTWARD TRACKS AND NONE RETURN THE THIRD IS A DESERT UNTRODDEN BY THE FEET OF MEN THE FOURTH IS THE DESERT OF SAND AND THE FIFTH IS THE DESERT OF DUST AND THE SIXTH
3470-116550-0017 IS THE DESERT OF STONES AND THE SEVENTH IS THE DESERT OF DESERTS IN THE MIDST OF THE LAST OF THE DESERTS THAT LIE BEYOND BODRAHAN IN THE CENTRE OF THE DESERT OF DESERTS STANDETH THE IMAGE THAT HATH BEEN HEWN OF OLD OUT OF THE LIVING HILL
3470-116550-0018 WHOSE NAME IS RANORADA THE EYE IN THE WASTE ABOUT THE BASE OF RANORADA IS CARVED IN MYSTIC LETTERS THAT ARE VASTER THAN THE BEDS OF STREAMS THESE WORDS TO THE GOD WHO KNOWS
3470-116550-0019 NOW BEYOND THE SECOND DESERT ARE NO TRACKS AND THERE IS NO WATER IN ALL THE SEVEN DESERTS THAT LIE BEYOND BODRAHAN THEREFORE CAME NO MAN THITHER TO HEW THAT STATUE FROM THE LIVING HILLS AND RANORADA WAS WROUGHT BY THE HANDS OF GODS
3470-116550-0020 MEN TELL IN BODRAHAN WHERE THE CARAVANS END AND ALL THE DRIVERS OF THE CAMELS REST HOW ONCE THE GODS HEWED RANORADA FROM THE LIVING HILL HAMMERING ALL NIGHT LONG BEYOND THE DESERTS MOREOVER THEY SAY THAT RANORADA IS CARVED IN THE LIKENESS OF THE GOD
3470-116550-0021 HOODRAZAI WHO HATH FOUND THE SECRET OF MANA YOOD SUSHAI AND KNOWETH THE WHEREFORE OF THE MAKING OF THE GODS THEY SAY THAT HOODRAZAI STANDS ALL ALONE IN PEGANA AND SPEAKS TO NONE BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT IS HIDDEN FROM THE GODS
3470-116550-0022 THEREFORE THE GODS HAVE MADE HIS IMAGE IN A LONELY LAND AS ONE WHO THINKS AND IS SILENT THE EYE IN THE WASTE THEY SAY THAT HOODRAZAI HAD HEARD THE MURMERS OF MANA YOOD SUSHAI AS HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF
3470-116550-0023 AND GLEANED THE MEANING AND KNEW AND THAT HE WAS THE GOD OF MIRTH AND OF ABUNDANT JOY BUT BECAME FROM THE MOMENT OF HIS KNOWING A MIRTHLESS GOD EVEN AS HIS IMAGE WHICH REGARDS THE DESERTS BEYOND THE TRACK OF MAN BUT THE CAMEL DRIVERS
3470-116550-0024 AS THEY SIT AND LISTEN TO THE TALES OF THE OLD MEN IN THE MARKET PLACE OF BODRAHAN AT EVENING WHILE THE CAMELS REST SAY IF HOODRAZAI IS SO VERY WISE AND YET IS SAD LET US DRINK WINE AND BANISH WISDOM TO THE WASTES THAT LIE BEYOND BODRAHAN
3470-116550-0025 THEREFORE IS THERE FEASTING AND LAUGHTER ALL NIGHT LONG IN THE CITY WHERE THE CARAVANS END ALL THIS THE CAMEL DRIVERS TELL WHEN THE CARAVANS COME IN FROM BODRAHAN BUT WHO SHALL CREDIT TALES THAT CAMEL DRIVERS HAVE HEARD FROM AGED MEN
3470-116550-0026 IN SO REMOTE A CITY OF THE THING THAT IS NEITHER GOD NOR BEAST SEEING THAT WISDOM IS NOT IN CITIES NOR HAPPINESS IN WISDOM
3470-116550-0027 AND BECAUSE YADIN THE PROPHET WAS DOOMED BY THE GODS ERE HE WAS BORN TO GO IN SEARCH OF WISDOM HE FOLLOWED THE CARAVANS TO BODRAHAN THERE IN THE EVENING WHERE THE CAMELS REST
3470-116550-0028 WHEN THE WIND OF THE DAY EBBS OUT INTO THE DESERT SIGHING AMID THE PALMS ITS LAST FAREWELLS AND LEAVING THE CARAVANS STILL HE SENT HIS PRAYER WITH THE WIND TO DRIFT INTO THE DESERT CALLING TO HOODRAZAI AND DOWN THE WIND HIS PRAYER WENT CALLING
3470-116550-0029 WHY DO THE GODS ENDURE AND PLAY THEIR GAME WITH MEN WHY DOTH NOT SKARL FORSAKE HIS DRUMMING AND MANA CEASE TO REST AND THE ECHO OF SEVEN DESERTS ANSWERED WHO KNOWS WHO KNOWS
3470-116550-0030 BUT OUT IN THE WASTE BEYOND THE SEVEN DESERTS WHERE RANORADA LOOMS ENORMOUS IN THE DUSK AT EVENING HIS PRAYER WAS HEARD AND FROM THE RIM OF THE WASTE WHITHER HAD GONE HIS PRAYER CAME THREE FLAMINGOES FLYING AND THEIR VOICES SAID
3470-116550-0031 GOING SOUTH GOING SOUTH AT EVERY STROKE OF THEIR WINGS BUT AS THEY PASSED BY THE PROPHET THEY SEEMED SO COOL AND FREE AND THE DESERT SO BLINDING AND HOT THAT HE STRETCHED UP HIS ARMS TOWARDS THEM
3470-116550-0032 THEN IT SEEMED HAPPY TO FLY AND PLEASANT TO FOLLOW BEHIND GREAT WHITE WINGS AND HE WAS WITH THE THREE FLAMINGOES UP IN THE COOL ABOVE THE DESERT AND THEIR VOICES CRIED BEFORE HIM GOING SOUTH GOING SOUTH AND THE DESERT BELOW HIM MUMBLED
3470-116550-0033 WHO KNOWS WHO KNOWS SOMETIMES THE EARTH STRETCHED UP TOWARDS THEM WITH PEAKS OF MOUNTAINS SOMETIMES IT FELL AWAY IN STEEP RAVINES BLUE RIVERS SANG TO THEM AS THEY PASSED ABOVE THEM OR VERY FAINTLY CAME THE SONG OF BREEZES IN LONE ORCHARDS
3470-116550-0034 AND FAR AWAY THE SEA SANG MIGHTY DIRGES OF OLD FORSAKEN ISLES BUT IT SEEMED THAT IN ALL THE WORLD THERE WAS NOTHING ONLY TO BE GOING SOUTH IT SEEMED THAT SOMEWHERE THE SOUTH WAS CALLING TO HER OWN AND THAT THEY WERE GOING SOUTH
3470-116550-0035 BUT WHEN THE PROPHET SAW THAT THEY HAD PASSED ABOVE THE EDGE OF EARTH AND THAT FAR AWAY TO THE NORTH OF THEM LAY THE MOON HE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS FOLLOWING NO MORTAL BIRDS BUT SOME STRANGE MESSENGERS OF HOODRAZAI WHOSE NEST HAD LAIN IN ONE OF PEGANA'S VALES
3470-116550-0036 BELOW THE MOUNTAINS WHEREON SIT THE GODS STILL THEY WENT SOUTH PASSING BY ALL THE WORLDS AND LEAVING THEM TO THE NORTH TILL ONLY ARAXES ZADRES AND HYRAGLION LAY STILL TO THE SOUTH OF THEM
3470-116550-0037 AND YO AND MINDO COULD BE SEEN NO MORE STILL THEY WENT SOUTH TILL THEY PASSED BELOW THE SOUTH AND CAME TO THE RIM OF THE WORLDS THERE THERE IS NEITHER SOUTH NOR EAST NOR WEST BUT ONLY NORTH AND BEYOND
3470-116550-0038 THAT IS NEITHER GOD NOR BEAST WHO NEITHER HOWLS NOR BREATHES ONLY IT TURNS OVER THE LEAVES OF A GREAT BOOK BLACK AND WHITE BLACK AND WHITE FOR EVER UNTIL THE END
3470-116550-0039 AND ALL THAT IS TO BE IS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK
3470-116550-0040 WHEN IT TURNETH A BLACK PAGE IT IS NIGHT AND WHEN IT TURNETH A WHITE PAGE IT IS DAY BECAUSE IT IS WRITTEN THAT THERE ARE GODS THERE ARE THE GODS ALSO THERE IS WRITING ABOUT THEE AND ME
3470-116550-0041 UNTIL THE PAGE WHERE OUR NAMES NO MORE ARE WRITTEN THEN AS THE PROPHET WATCHED IT TROGOOL TURNED A PAGE A BLACK ONE AND NIGHT WAS OVER AND DAY SHONE ON THE WORLDS
3470-116550-0042 TROGOOL IS THE THING THAT MEN IN MANY COUNTRIES HAVE CALLED BY MANY NAMES IT IS THE THING THAT SITS BEHIND THE GODS WHOSE BOOK IS THE SCHEME OF THINGS BUT WHEN YADIN SAW THAT OLD REMEMBERED DAYS WERE HIDDEN AWAY WITH THE PART THAT IT HAD TURNED
3470-116550-0043 AND KNEW THAT UPON ONE WHOSE NAME IS WRIT NO MORE THE LAST PAGE HAD TURNED FOR EVER A THOUSAND PAGES BACK THEN DID HE UTTER HIS PRAYER
3470-116550-0044 WHO ONLY TURNS THE PAGES AND NEVER ANSWERS PRAYER HE PRAYED IN THE FACE OF TROGOOL ONLY TURN BACK THY PAGES TO THE NAME OF ONE WHICH IS WRIT NO MORE AND FAR AWAY UPON A PLACE NAMED EARTH SHALL RISE THE PRAYERS OF A LITTLE PEOPLE THAT ACCLAIM THE NAME OF TROGOOL
3470-116550-0045 YADIN FOUND HIMSELF LYING IN THE DESERT WHERE ONE GAVE HIM WATER AND AFTERWARDS CARRIED HIM ON A CAMEL INTO BODRAHAN THERE SOME SAID THAT HE HAD BUT DREAMED WHEN THIRST SEIZED HIM WHILE HE WANDERED AMONG THE ROCKS IN THE DESERT
3470-116550-0046 BUT CERTAIN AGED MEN OF BODRAHAN SAY THAT INDEED THERE SITTETH SOMEWHERE A THING THAT IS CALLED TROGOOL THAT IS NEITHER GOD NOR BEAST THAT TURNETH THE LEAVES OF A BOOK BLACK AND WHITE BLACK AND WHITE
3470-116550-0047 UNTIL HE COME TO THE WORDS
3470-116550-0048 WHICH MEANS THE END FOR EVER
