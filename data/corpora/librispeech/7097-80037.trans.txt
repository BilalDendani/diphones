7097-80037-0000 HAD BECOME QUITE AN INSTITUTION IN LONDON SHE HAD OBTAINED FULL THOUGH BY NO MEANS UNDISPUTED POSSESSION OF THE GREAT HALL IN THE MARYLEBONE ROAD AND WAS UNDOUBTEDLY FOR THE MOMENT
7097-80037-0001 AND DISTURBED THE HAPPINESS OF MANY FATHERS OF FAMILIES IT MAY EASILY BE CONCEIVED THAT ALL THIS WAS GALL AND WORMWOOD TO THE BARONESS BANMANN
7097-80037-0002 THE BARONESS ON HER ARRIVAL IN LONDON HAD ANTICIPATED THE SUCCESS WHICH THIS LOW BRED AMERICAN FEMALE HAD ACHIEVED IT WAS NOT SIMPLY THE HONOUR OF THE THING WHICH WAS VERY GREAT
7097-80037-0003 AND WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DEAR TO THE BARONESS BUT THE AMERICAN DOCTOR WAS MAKING A RAPID FORTUNE OUT OF THE PROCEEDS OF THE HALL
7097-80037-0004 SHE HAD ON ONE OCCASION THREATENED TO STRIKE LECTURING UNLESS SHE WERE ALLOWED A CERTAIN VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE ON THE SUM TAKEN AT THE DOORS AND THE STEWARDS AND DIRECTORS OF THE INSTITUTE
7097-80037-0005 HAD FOUND THEMSELVES COMPELLED TO GIVE WAY TO HER DEMANDS SHE HAD CONSEQUENTLY LODGED HERSELF MAGNIFICENTLY AT THE LANGHAM HOTEL HAD SET UP HER BROUGHAM IN WHICH SHE ALWAYS HAD HERSELF DRIVEN TO THE INSTITUTE
7097-80037-0006 AND WAS ASKED OUT TO DINNER THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK WHEREAS THE BARONESS WAS IN A VERY POOR CONDITION SHE HAD INDEED SUCCEEDED IN GETTING HERSELF INVITED TO MISTER DE BARON'S HOUSE AND FROM TIME TO TIME
7097-80037-0007 RAISED A LITTLE MONEY FROM THOSE WHO WERE UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO COME IN HER WAY BUT SHE WAS SENSIBLE OF HER OWN DEGRADATION AND AT THE SAME TIME QUITE ASSURED THAT AS A PREACHER
7097-80037-0008 ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS AT LARGE SHE COULD TEACH LESSONS INFINITELY SUPERIOR TO ANYTHING THAT HAD COME FROM THAT IMPUDENT BUT IMBECILE AMERICAN
7097-80037-0009 HAD FOR THE MOMENT BEEN THE SPOKESWOMAN AND IN THESE OVERTURES IT HAD BEEN INTIMATED TO HER THAT THE DIRECTORS WOULD BE HAPPY TO REMUNERATE HER FOR HER TROUBLE SHOULD THE MONEY COLLECTED AT THE HALL ENABLE THEM TO DO SO
7097-80037-0010 THE BARONESS BELIEVED THAT ENORMOUS SUMS HAD BEEN RECEIVED AND WAS LOUD IN ASSURING ALL HER FRIENDS THAT THIS POPULARITY HAD IN THE FIRST PLACE BEEN PRODUCED BY HER OWN EXERTIONS
7097-80037-0011 AT ANY RATE SHE WAS RESOLVED TO SEEK REDRESS AT LAW AND AT LAST HAD BEEN ADVISED TO PROCEED CONJOINTLY AGAINST AUNT JU LADY SELINA PROTEST AND THE BALD HEADED OLD GENTLEMAN
7097-80037-0012 THE BUSINESS HAD NOW BEEN BROUGHT INTO PROPER FORM AND THE TRIAL WAS TO TAKE PLACE IN MARCH ALL THIS WAS THE CAUSE OF MUCH TROUBLE TO POOR MARY AND OF VERY GREAT VEXATION TO LORD GEORGE
7097-80037-0013 WHEN THE FEUD WAS FIRST BECOMING FURIOUS AN ENORMOUS ADVERTISEMENT WAS ISSUED BY DOCTOR FLEABODY'S FRIENDS IN WHICH HER CAUSE WAS ADVOCATED AND HER CLAIMS RECAPITULATED
7097-80037-0014 GENTRY AND PEOPLE OF ENGLAND WHO SUPPORTED THE DISABILITIES GENERALLY AND HER CAUSE IN PARTICULAR AMONG THESE NAMES WHICH WERE VERY NUMEROUS APPEARED THAT OF LADY GEORGE GERMAIN
7097-80037-0015 OH GEORGE SHE SAID LOOK HERE WHAT RIGHT HAVE THEY TO SAY SO I NEVER PATRONISED ANYTHING I WENT THERE ONCE WHEN I CAME TO LONDON FIRST BECAUSE MISS MILDMAY ASKED ME YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE
7097-80037-0016 SAID HE WE HAVE HAD ALL THAT BEFORE AND YOU NEED NOT SCOLD ME AGAIN THERE COULDN'T BE ANY GREAT HARM IN GOING TO HEAR A LECTURE THIS OCCURRED JUST PREVIOUS TO HER GOING DOWN TO MANOR CROSS
7097-80037-0017 THAT JOURNEY WHICH WAS TO BE MADE FOR SO IMPORTANT AN OBJECT THEN LORD GEORGE DID JUST WHAT HE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE DONE HE WROTE AN ANGRY LETTER TO MISS FLEABODY AS HE CALLED HER COMPLAINING BITTERLY
7097-80037-0018 OF THE INSERTION OF HIS WIFE'S NAME DOCTOR FLEABODY WAS QUITE CLEVER ENOUGH TO MAKE FRESH CAPITAL OUT OF THIS SHE WITHDREW THE NAME EXPLAINING THAT SHE HAD BEEN ORDERED TO DO SO BY THE LADY'S HUSBAND
7097-80037-0019 AND IMPLYING THAT THEREBY ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE WAS SUPPLIED THAT THE DISABILITIES OF WOMEN WERE ABSOLUTELY CRUSHING TO THE SEX IN ENGLAND
7097-80037-0020 MARY WHEN SHE SAW THIS AND THE PAPER DID NOT REACH HER TILL SHE WAS AT MANOR CROSS WAS VIOLENT IN HER ANXIETY TO WRITE HERSELF IN HER OWN NAME AND DISCLAIM ALL DISABILITIES
7097-80037-0021 AND MARY WAS FORCED TO KEEP HER INDIGNATION TO HERSELF
7097-80037-0022 A MAN CAME ALL THE WAY DOWN FROM LONDON FOR THE PURPOSE OF SERVING LADY GEORGE WITH A SUBPOENA TO GIVE EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL ON THE PART OF THE BARONESS LORD GEORGE WAS UP IN LONDON AT THE TIME
7097-80037-0023 NEVER HAVING ENTERED THE HOUSE AT MANOR CROSS OR EVEN THE PARK SINCE HIS VISIT TO ITALY THE CONSTERNATION OF THE LADIES MAY BE IMAGINED POOR MARY WAS CERTAINLY NOT IN A CONDITION TO GO INTO A COURT OF LAW
7097-80037-0024 AND WOULD BE LESS SO ON THE DAY FIXED FOR THE TRIAL AND YET THIS AWFUL DOCUMENT SEEMED TO HER AND TO HER SISTERS IN LAW TO BE SO IMPERATIVE AS TO ADMIT OF NO ESCAPE
7097-80037-0025 IT WAS IN VAIN THAT LADY SARAH WITH CONSIDERABLE CIRCUMLOCUTION ENDEAVOURED TO EXPLAIN TO THE MESSENGER THE TRUE STATE OF THE CASE THE MAN COULD SIMPLY SAY THAT HE WAS ONLY A MESSENGER
7097-80037-0026 AND HAD NOW DONE HIS WORK LOOKED AT IN ANY LIGHT THE THING WAS VERY TERRIBLE LORD GEORGE MIGHT PROBABLY EVEN YET BE ABLE TO RUN AWAY WITH HER TO SOME OBSCURE CORNER OF THE CONTINENT
7097-80037-0027 IN WHICH MESSENGERS FROM THE QUEEN'S JUDGES WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FIND HER AND SHE MIGHT PERHAPS BEAR THE JOURNEY WITHOUT INJURY BUT THEN WHAT WOULD BECOME OF A BABY PERHAPS OF A POPENJOY SO BORN
7097-80037-0028 AND IN THAT CASE THE BABY WOULD AT ONCE BE A POPENJOY WHAT A CONDITION WAS THIS FOR A MARCHIONESS TO BE IN AT THE MOMENT OF THE BIRTH OF HER ELDEST CHILD
7097-80037-0029 SAID MARY THROUGH HER TEARS IT IS SUCH A PITY THAT YOU SHOULD EVER HAVE GONE SAID LADY SUSANNA SHAKING HER HEAD IT WASN'T WICKED TO GO SAID MARY AND I WON'T BE SCOLDED ABOUT IT ANY MORE
7097-80037-0030 YOU WENT TO A LECTURE YOURSELF WHEN YOU WERE IN TOWN AND THEY MIGHT JUST AS WELL HAVE SENT FOR YOU
7097-80037-0031 AND WAS VERY KEEN IN THINKING WHAT STEPS HAD BETTER BE TAKEN MARY WISHED TO RUN OFF TO THE DEANERY AT ONCE
7097-80037-0032 WHICH WAS OF COURSE WRITTEN BY THAT DAY'S POST TO LORD GEORGE THERE WERE STILL TEN DAYS TO THE TRIAL AND TWENTY DAYS BY COMPUTATION TO THE GREAT EVENT THERE WERE OF COURSE
7097-80037-0033 VARIOUS LETTERS WRITTEN TO LORD GEORGE LADY SARAH WROTE VERY SENSIBLY SUGGESTING THAT HE SHOULD GO TO MISTER STOKES THE FAMILY LAWYER
7097-80037-0034 SHE WAS HOWEVER OF OPINION THAT IF MARY WAS CONCEALED IN A CERTAIN ROOM AT MANOR CROSS WHICH MIGHT SHE THOUGHT BE SUFFICIENTLY WARMED AND VENTILATED FOR HEALTH
7097-80037-0035 THE JUDGES OF THE QUEEN'S BENCH WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND HER THE BABY IN THAT CASE WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN AT MANOR CROSS
7097-80037-0036 MARY'S LETTER WAS ALMOST HYSTERICALLY MISERABLE SHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE HORRID PEOPLE WHAT DID THEY WANT HER TO SAY ALL SHE HAD DONE WAS TO GO TO A LECTURE AND TO GIVE THE WICKED WOMAN A GUINEA
7097-80037-0037 WOULDN'T GEORGE COME AND TAKE HER AWAY SHE WOULDN'T CARE WHERE SHE WENT
7097-80037-0038 IT WAS SHE SAID VERY CRUEL AND SHE DID HOPE THAT GEORGE WOULD COME TO HER AT ONCE IF HE DIDN'T COME SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD DIE NOTHING OF COURSE WAS SAID TO THE MARCHIONESS
7097-80037-0039 BUT IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THE MATTER FROM MISSUS TOFF MISSUS TOFF WAS OF OPINION THAT THE BIT OF PAPER SHOULD BE BURNED AND THAT NO FURTHER NOTICE SHOULD BE TAKEN OF THE MATTER AT ALL IF THEY DON'T GO
7097-80037-0040 MISSUS TOFF REMEMBERING THAT A BROTHER OF HERS WHO HAD FORGOTTEN HIMSELF IN LIQUOR AT THE BROTHERTON ASSIZES
7097-80037-0041 WHO REMEMBERED ALSO THAT THE GOOD NATURED JUDGE
7097-80037-0042 BUT LADY SARAH COULD NOT LOOK AT THE MATTER IN THAT LIGHT SHE WAS SURE THAT IF A WITNESS WERE REALLY WANTED THAT WITNESS COULD NOT ESCAPE BY PAYING A FINE
7097-80037-0043 THE NEXT MORNING THERE CAME A HEARTRENDING LETTER FROM AUNT JU SHE WAS VERY SORRY THAT LADY GEORGE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO TROUBLED BUT THEN LET THEM THINK OF HER TROUBLE OF HER MISERY
7097-80037-0044 THAT ODIOUS BARONESS HAD SUMMONED EVERYBODY THAT HAD EVER BEFRIENDED HER CAPTAIN DE BARON HAD BEEN SUMMONED
7097-80037-0045 AND MISSUS MONTACUTE JONES AND THE WHOLE EXPENSE ACCORDING TO AUNT JU WOULD FALL UPON HER FOR IT SEEMED TO BE THE OPINION OF THE LAWYERS THAT SHE HAD HIRED THE BARONESS
7097-80037-0046 THEN SHE SAID SOME VERY SEVERE THINGS AGAINST THE DISABILITIES GENERALLY THERE WAS THAT WOMAN FLEABODY MAKING A FORTUNE IN THEIR HALL AND WOULD TAKE NONE OF THIS EXPENSE UPON HERSELF
7097-80037-0047 SHE THOUGHT THAT SUCH THINGS SHOULD BE LEFT TO MEN WHO AFTER ALL WERE NOT SO MEAN AS WOMEN SO AT LEAST SAID AUNT JU AND THEN THERE WAS NEW CAUSE FOR WONDERMENT
7097-80037-0048 LORD BROTHERTON HAD BEEN SUMMONED AND WOULD LORD BROTHERTON COME THEY ALL BELIEVED THAT HE WAS DYING AND IF SO SURELY HE COULD NOT BE MADE TO COME BUT IS IT NOT HORRIBLE SAID LADY SUSANNA
7097-80037-0049 THAT PEOPLE OF RANK SHOULD BE MADE SUBJECT TO SUCH AN ANNOYANCE IF ANYBODY CAN SUMMON ANYBODY NOBODY CAN EVER BE SURE OF HERSELF ON THE NEXT MORNING LORD GEORGE HIMSELF CAME DOWN TO BROTHERTON AND MARY
7097-80037-0050 WITH A CARRIAGE FULL OF PRECAUTIONS WAS SENT INTO THE DEANERY TO MEET HIM THE MARCHIONESS DISCOVERED THAT THE JOURNEY WAS TO BE MADE AND WAS FULL OF MISGIVINGS AND FULL OF ENQUIRIES
7097-80037-0051 IN HER PRESENT CONDITION THE MOTHER EXPECTANT OUGHT NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY JOURNEY AT ALL THE MARCHIONESS REMEMBERED HOW SIR HENRY HAD TOLD HER BEFORE POPENJOY WAS BORN THAT ALL CARRIAGE EXERCISE WAS BAD
7097-80037-0052 AND WHY SHOULD SHE GO TO THE DEANERY WHO COULD SAY WHETHER THE DEAN WOULD LET HER COME AWAY AGAIN WHAT A FEATHER IT WOULD BE IN THE DEAN'S CAP IF THE NEXT POPENJOY WERE BORN AT THE DEANERY
7097-80037-0053 IT WAS EXPLAINED TO HER THAT IN NO OTHER WAY COULD SHE SEE HER HUSBAND THEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN WAS ONCE MORE LOUD IN DENOUNCING THE MISCONDUCT OF HER YOUNGEST SON TO THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY
7097-80037-0054 MARY MADE THE JOURNEY IN PERFECT SAFETY AND THEN WAS ABLE TO TELL HER FATHER THE WHOLE STORY I NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING SO ABSURD IN MY LIFE SAID THE DEAN I SUPPOSE I MUST GO PAPA NOT A YARD
7097-80037-0055 FETCH YOU NO DOES IT MEAN NOTHING VERY LITTLE
7097-80037-0056 THAT BARONESS PROBABLY THINKS THAT SHE WILL GET MONEY OUT OF YOU IF THE WORST COMES TO THE WORST YOU MUST SEND A MEDICAL CERTIFICATE WILL THAT DO OF COURSE IT WILL WHEN GEORGE IS HERE WE WILL GET DOCTOR LOFTLY
7097-80037-0057 AND HE WILL MAKE IT STRAIGHT FOR US YOU NEED NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT IT AT ALL THOSE WOMEN AT MANOR CROSS ARE OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE KNOWN BETTER LORD GEORGE CAME AND WAS VERY ANGRY
7097-80037-0058 AND WHO TOOK UPON HIMSELF TO ASSURE LADY GEORGE THAT ALL THE JUDGES IN THE LAND COULD NOT ENFORCE HER ATTENDANCE AS LONG AS SHE HAD THAT CERTIFICATE IN HER HANDS
7097-80037-0059 AND COULD NOT REFRAIN HIMSELF FROM A CROSS WORD OR TWO
7097-80037-0060 OH GEORGE ARE WE TO HAVE THAT ALL AGAIN WHY SHOULDN'T SHE HAVE GONE ASKED THE DEAN ARE YOU IN FAVOUR OF RIGHTS OF WOMEN NOT PARTICULARLY
7097-80037-0061 IF THERE BE ANY RIGHTS WHICH THEY HAVEN'T GOT I THOROUGHLY WISH THAT THEY MIGHT GET THEM I CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE IN THE BARONESS BANMANN
7097-80037-0062 BUT I DON'T THINK THEY COULD HAVE BEEN WRONG IN GOING IN GOOD COMPANY TO HEAR WHAT A CRAZY OLD WOMAN MIGHT HAVE TO SAY IT WAS VERY FOOLISH SAID LORD GEORGE SEE WHAT HAS COME OF IT
7097-80037-0063 HOW COULD I TELL GEORGE
7097-80037-0064 NASTY FAT OLD WOMAN I'M SURE I DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR HER THEN LORD GEORGE WENT BACK TO TOWN WITH THE MEDICAL CERTIFICATE IN HIS POCKET AND MARY BEING IN HER PRESENT CONDITION AFRAID OF THE AUTHORITIES
7097-80037-0065 WAS UNABLE TO STAY AND BE HAPPY EVEN FOR ONE EVENING WITH HER FATHER DURING THE MONTH THE DISABILITIES CREATED A CONSIDERABLE INTEREST THROUGHOUT LONDON OF WHICH DOCTOR FLEABODY REAPED THE FULL ADVANTAGE
7097-80037-0066 THE BARONESS WAS SO LOUD IN HER CLAMOURS THAT SHE FORCED THE QUESTION OF THE DISABILITIES ON THE PUBLIC MIND GENERALLY AND THE RESULT WAS THAT THE WORLD FLOCKED TO THE INSTITUTE
7097-80037-0067 THE BARONESS AS SHE HEARD OF THIS BECAME LOUDER AND LOUDER IT WAS NOT THIS THAT SHE WANTED
7097-80037-0068 THE BARONESS WHEN SHE DESIRED TO BE LITTLE THE DOCTOR ALWAYS CALLED HER A FEMALE AND THE BARONESS THOUGH IN TRUTH SHE WAS NOT PERSONALLY ATTRACTIVE DID CONTRIVE TO SURROUND HERSELF WITH SUPPORTERS
7097-80037-0069 AND IN THESE DAYS MOVED INTO COMFORTABLE LODGINGS IN WIGMORE STREET VERY FEW WERE HEARD TO SPEAK IN HER FAVOUR BUT THEY WHO CONTRIBUTED TO THE RELIEF OF HER NECESSITIES WERE MANY
7097-80037-0070 IT WAS FOUND TO BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE FROM HER WITHOUT LEAVING SOME AMOUNT OF MONEY IN HER HANDS AND THEN IN A HAPPY HOUR SHE CAME AT LAST ACROSS AN OLD GENTLEMAN
7097-80037-0071 WHO DID APPRECIATE HER AND HER WRONGS HOW IT WAS THAT SHE GOT AN INTRODUCTION TO MISTER PHILOGUNAC COELEBS WAS NOT I THINK EVER KNOWN IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT HAVING HEARD OF HIS SOFT HEART
7097-80037-0072 HIS PECULIAR PROPENSITIES AND HIS WEALTH SHE CONTRIVED TO INTRODUCE HERSELF IT WAS HOWEVER SUDDENLY UNDERSTOOD THAT MISTER PHILOGUNAC COELEBS WHO WAS A BACHELOR AND VERY RICH HAD TAKEN HER BY THE HAND
7097-80037-0073 AND INTENDED TO BEAR ALL THE EXPENSES OF THE TRIAL IT WAS AFTER THE GENERAL INTIMATION WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO THE WORLD IN THIS MATTER THAT THE SUMMONS FOR LADY MARY HAD BEEN SENT DOWN TO MANOR CROSS
7097-80037-0074 EVERYWHERE HOW SHE DID WORK THE ATTORNIES WHO HAD THE CASE IN HANDS FOUND THEMSELVES UNABLE TO SECURE THEMSELVES AGAINST HER SHE INSISTED ON SEEING THE BARRISTERS
7097-80037-0075 AND ABSOLUTELY DID WORK HER WAY INTO THE CHAMBERS OF THAT DISCREET JUNIOR MISTER STUFFENRUFF SHE WAS FULL OF HER CASE FULL OF HER COMING TRIUMPH SHE WOULD TEACH WOMEN LIKE MISS JULIA MILDMAY
7097-80037-0076 AND LADY SELINA PROTEST
7097-80037-0077 AND AS FOR THE AMERICAN FEMALE YOU'LL PUT HER PIPE OUT SUGGESTED MISTER PHILOGUNAC COELEBS WHO WAS NOT SUPERIOR TO A MILD JOKE STOP HER FROM PIPING ALTOGETHER IN DIS CONTRY SAID THE BARONESS
7097-80037-0078 WHO IN THE MIDST OF HER WRATH AND ZEAL AND LABOUR WAS SUPERIOR TO ALL JOKES TWO DAYS BEFORE THAT FIXED FOR THE TRIAL THERE FELL A GREAT BLOW UPON THOSE WHO WERE INTERESTED IN THE MATTER
7097-80037-0079 A BLOW THAT WAS HEAVY ON MISTER COELEBS BUT HEAVIER STILL ON THE ATTORNIES THE BARONESS HAD TAKEN HERSELF OFF AND WHEN ENQUIRIES WERE MADE IT WAS FOUND THAT SHE WAS AT MADRID
7097-80037-0080 MISTER SNAPE ONE OF THE LAWYERS WAS THE PERSON WHO FIRST INFORMED MISTER COELEBS AND DID SO IN A MANNER WHICH CLEARLY IMPLIED THAT HE EXPECTED MISTER COELEBS TO PAY THE BILL THEN MISTER SNAPE
7097-80037-0081 ENCOUNTERED A TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT AND MISTER COELEBS WAS DRIVEN TO CONFESS HIS OWN DISGRACE HE HAD HE SAID NEVER UNDERTAKEN TO PAY THE COST OF THE TRIAL
7097-80037-0082 BUT HE HAD UNFORTUNATELY GIVEN THE LADY A THOUSAND POUNDS TO ENABLE HER TO PAY THE EXPENSES HERSELF MISTER SNAPE EXPOSTULATED AND LATER ON URGED WITH MUCH PERSISTENCY
7097-80037-0083 THEY HAD TAKEN THEIR ORDERS FROM THE LADY AND MUST LOOK TO THE LADY FOR PAYMENT THEY WHO BEST KNEW MISTER PHILOGUNAC COELEBS THOUGHT THAT HE HAD ESCAPED CHEAPLY
7097-80037-0084 I AM SO GLAD SHE HAS GONE SAID MARY WHEN SHE HEARD THE STORY I SHOULD NEVER HAVE FELT SAFE WHILE THAT WOMAN WAS IN THE COUNTRY
