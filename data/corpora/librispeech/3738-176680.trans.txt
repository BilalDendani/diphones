3738-176680-0000 THE LONGEST OF HER LIFE WAS THAT DAY TO JUNE THE ANXIETY IN TIMES OF WAR FOR THE WOMEN WHO WAIT AT HOME IS VAGUE
3738-176680-0001 BUT A SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT INVOLVES DEATH TO THOSE LOVED ONES HAS A SPECIAL AND POIGNANT TERROR OF ITS OWN JUNE KNEW HER FATHER'S PLAN THE PRECISE TIME THE FIGHT WOULD TAKE PLACE AND THE ESPECIAL DANGER THAT WAS HALE'S
3738-176680-0002 FOR SHE KNEW THAT YOUNG DAVE TOLLIVER HAD MARKED HIM WITH THE FIRST SHOT FIRED DRY EYED AND WHITE AND DUMB SHE WATCHED THEM MAKE READY FOR THE START THAT MORNING WHILE IT WAS YET DARK DULLY SHE HEARD THE HORSES SNORTING FROM THE COLD
3738-176680-0003 LIKE GHOSTLY FIGURES IN A DREAM ONCE ONLY DID SHE OPEN HER LIPS AND THAT WAS TO PLEAD WITH HER FATHER TO LEAVE BUB AT HOME BUT HER FATHER GAVE HER NO ANSWER AND BUB SNORTED HIS INDIGNATION HE WAS A MAN NOW
3738-176680-0004 HOW DIFFERENTLY SHE SAW THESE THINGS NOW FOR A MAN WHO DESERVED DEATH AND TO FIGHT A MAN WHO WAS READY TO DIE FOR HIS DUTY TO THAT LAW
3738-176680-0005 THE MAN WHO HAD PLANTED FOR HER THE DEW DRENCHED GARDEN THAT WAS WAITING FOR THE SUN AND HAD BUILT THE LITTLE ROOM BEHIND HER FOR HER COMFORT AND SECLUSION WHO HAD SENT HER TO SCHOOL HAD NEVER BEEN ANYTHING BUT KIND AND JUST TO HER AND TO EVERYBODY
3738-176680-0006 WHO HAD TAUGHT HER LIFE AND THANK GOD LOVE WAS SHE REALLY THE JUNE TOLLIVER WHO HAD GONE OUT INTO THE WORLD AND HAD HELD HER PLACE THERE
3738-176680-0007 WHO HAD CONQUERED BIRTH AND SPEECH AND CUSTOMS AND ENVIRONMENT SO THAT NONE COULD TELL WHAT THEY ALL ONCE WERE WHO HAD BECOME THE LADY THE WOMAN OF THE WORLD IN MANNER DRESS AND EDUCATION
3738-176680-0008 CALLING HER DOWN INTO THE OLD MEAN ROUND OF DRUDGERY
3738-176680-0009 LIKE A SKY OF BRASS AROUND HER OWN AND WHEN THE VOICE CAME INSTEAD OF BURSTING INTO TEARS AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO DO SHE GAVE A HARD LITTLE LAUGH AND SHE LIFTED A DEFIANT FACE TO THE RISING SUN
3738-176680-0010 THERE WAS A LIMIT TO THE SACRIFICE FOR KINDRED BROTHER FATHER HOME AND THAT LIMIT WAS THE ETERNAL SACRIFICE THE ETERNAL UNDOING OF HERSELF WHEN THIS WRETCHED TERRIBLE BUSINESS WAS OVER SHE WOULD SET HER FEET WHERE THAT SUN COULD RISE ON HER
3738-176680-0011 BUSY WITH THE WORK THAT SHE COULD DO IN THAT WORLD FOR WHICH SHE FELT SHE WAS BORN SWIFTLY SHE DID THE MORNING CHORES AND THEN SHE SAT ON THE PORCH THINKING AND WAITING SPINNING WHEEL LOOM AND DARNING NEEDLE WERE TO LIE IDLE THAT DAY
3738-176680-0012 THE OLD STEP MOTHER HAD GOTTEN FROM BED AND WAS DRESSING HERSELF MIRACULOUSLY CURED OF A SUDDEN MIRACULOUSLY ACTIVE SHE BEGAN TO TALK OF WHAT SHE NEEDED IN TOWN AND JUNE SAID NOTHING
3738-176680-0013 SHE WENT OUT TO THE STABLE AND LED OUT THE OLD SORREL MARE SHE WAS GOING TO THE HANGING
3738-176680-0014 NO SAID JUNE FIERCELY WELL YOU NEEDN'T GIT MAD ABOUT IT
3738-176680-0015 JUNE ANSWERED NOTHING BUT IN SILENCE WATCHED HER GET READY
3738-176680-0016 HALE HAD ONCE TOLD HER THAT THEY MEANT RAIN FAR AWAY THE MOUNTAINS WERE OVERHUNG WITH PURPLE SO DEEP THAT THE VERY AIR LOOKED LIKE MIST AND A PEACE THAT SEEMED MOTHERLIKE IN TENDERNESS BROODED OVER THE EARTH PEACE
3738-176680-0017 AND TWO BODIES OF MEN ONE LED BY HER FATHER THE OTHER BY THE MAN SHE LOVED READY TO FLY AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS THE ONE TO GET THE CONDEMNED MAN ALIVE THE OTHER TO SEE THAT HE DIED SHE GOT UP WITH A GROAN SHE WALKED INTO THE GARDEN
3738-176680-0018 THE GRASS WAS TALL TANGLED AND WITHERING AND IN IT DEAD LEAVES LAY EVERYWHERE STEMS UP STEMS DOWN IN RECKLESS CONFUSION THE SCARLET SAGE PODS WERE BROWN AND SEEDS WERE DROPPING FROM THEIR TINY GAPING MOUTHS
3738-176680-0019 THE MARIGOLDS WERE FROST NIPPED AND ONE LONELY BLACK WINGED BUTTERFLY WAS VAINLY SEARCHING THEM ONE BY ONE FOR THE LOST SWEETS OF SUMMER THE GORGEOUS CROWNS OF THE SUN FLOWERS WERE NOTHING BUT GROTESQUE BLACK MUMMY HEADS
3738-176680-0020 SET ON LEAN DEAD BODIES AND THE CLUMP OF BIG CASTOR PLANTS BUFFETED BY THE WIND LEANED THIS WAY AND THAT LIKE GIANTS IN A DRUNKEN ORGY TRYING TO KEEP ONE ANOTHER FROM FALLING DOWN
3738-176680-0021 THE BLIGHT THAT WAS ON THE GARDEN WAS THE BLIGHT THAT WAS IN HER HEART AND TWO BITS OF CHEER ONLY SHE FOUND ONE YELLOW NASTURTIUM SCARLET FLECKED WHOSE FRAGRANCE WAS A MEMORY OF THE SPRING THAT WAS LONG GONE
3738-176680-0022 AS THOUGH TO PROMISE THAT ANOTHER SPRING WOULD SURELY COME WITH THE FLOWER IN HER HAND SHE STARTED UP THE RAVINE TO HER DREAMING PLACE BUT IT WAS SO LONELY UP THERE AND SHE TURNED BACK SHE WENT INTO HER ROOM AND TRIED TO READ
3738-176680-0023 SHE TURNED AND WATCHED THE LONG HAND HOW LONG A MINUTE WAS
3738-176680-0024 SHE COULD NOT BE ALONE WHEN THE HOUR CAME AND SHE STARTED DOWN THE ROAD TOWARD UNCLE BILLY'S MILL HALE HALE HALE THE NAME BEGAN TO RING IN HER EARS LIKE A BELL
3738-176680-0025 AND THE CAT HAD GOT HER TONGUE SHE REMEMBERED WHEN SHE HAD WRITTEN HER NAME AFTER SHE HAD FIRST KISSED HIM AT THE FOOT OF THE BEECH JUNE HAIL
3738-176680-0026 OR WAS IT ALREADY THE STAIN OF DEAD LEAVES HALE COULD HAVE TOLD HER THOSE LEAVES WERE FLOATING THROUGH THE SHADOWS AND WHEN THE WIND MOVED OTHERS ZIG ZAGGED SOFTLY DOWN TO JOIN THEM THE WIND WAS HELPING THEM ON THE WATER TOO
3738-176680-0027 WITH HER HANDS BEHIND HER AND HER EYES BENT ON THE ROAD WHAT SHOULD SHE DO SHE HAD NO MONEY HER FATHER HAD NONE TO SPARE AND SHE COULD ACCEPT NO MORE FROM HALE ONCE SHE STOPPED AND STARED WITH UNSEEING EYES AT THE BLUE SKY
3738-176680-0028 WHEN SHE REACHED THE MILLER'S CABIN SHE WENT TO THE PORCH WITHOUT NOTICING THAT THE DOOR WAS CLOSED
3738-176680-0029 WHEN SHE REACHED THE GATE SHE HEARD THE CLOCK BEGINNING TO STRIKE AND WITH ONE HAND ON HER BREAST SHE BREATHLESSLY LISTENED COUNTING EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN
3738-176680-0030 WHILE JUNE WATCHED THE CREAKING OLD WHEEL DROPPING THE SUN SHOT SPARKLING WATER INTO THE SWIFT SLUICE BUT HARDLY SEEING IT AT ALL BY AND BY UNCLE BILLY CAME OUTSIDE AND SAT DOWN AND NEITHER SPOKE A WORD
3738-176680-0031 AND YET FOR THREE HOURS MORE SHE HAD TO STAND IT WHILE THE CAVALCADE OF TOLLIVERS WITH RUFE'S BODY
3738-176680-0032 SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WOULD FLY AT HIS THROAT AND DAVE AMAZED SHRANK BACK A STEP GO HOME I TELL YE UNCLE JUDD'S SHOT
3738-176680-0033 SHE PUT HER HANDS TO HER HEAD AS THOUGH SHE WERE CRAZED AND THEN SHE TURNED AND BROKE INTO A SWIFT RUN UP THE ROAD PANTING JUNE REACHED THE GATE THE FRONT DOOR WAS CLOSED AND THERE SHE GAVE A TREMULOUS CRY FOR BUB
3738-176680-0034 THE DOOR OPENED A FEW INCHES AND THROUGH IT BUB SHOUTED FOR HER TO COME ON THE BACK DOOR TOO WAS CLOSED AND NOT A RAY OF DAYLIGHT ENTERED THE ROOM EXCEPT AT THE PORT HOLE WHERE BUB WITH A WINCHESTER HAD BEEN STANDING ON GUARD
3738-176680-0035 BY THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE SHE SAW HER FATHER'S GIANT FRAME STRETCHED OUT ON THE BED AND SHE HEARD HIS LABOURED BREATHING SWIFTLY SHE WENT TO THE BED AND DROPPED ON HER KNEES BESIDE IT DAD SHE SAID THE OLD MAN'S EYES OPENED AND TURNED HEAVILY TOWARD HER

3738-176680-0038 HIS VOICE HAD DROPPED TO A WHISPER AND HIS EYES CLOSED AGAIN THERE WAS ANOTHER CAUTIOUS HELLO OUTSIDE AND WHEN BUB AGAIN OPENED THE DOOR DAVE RAN SWIFTLY WITHIN HE PAID NO ATTENTION TO JUNE
3738-176680-0039 THERE WAS THREE OF EM HE SHOWED BUB A BULLET HOLE THROUGH ONE SLEEVE AND THEN HE TURNED HALF CONTEMPTUOUSLY TO JUNE I HAIN'T DONE IT ADDING GRIMLY

3738-176680-0044 TO STICK TO HER PEOPLE AND DO THE BEST SHE COULD WITH HER LIFE AND NOW AND THEN THROUGH THE NIGHT OLD JUDD WOULD OPEN HIS EYES AND STARE AT THE CEILING AND AT THESE TIMES IT WAS NOT THE PAIN IN HIS FACE THAT DISTRESSED HER AS MUCH AS THE DRAWN BEATEN LOOK
3738-176680-0045 THAT SHE HAD NOTICED GROWING IN IT FOR A LONG TIME IT WAS TERRIBLE THAT HELPLESS LOOK IN THE FACE OF A MAN SO BIG IN BODY SO STRONG OF MIND SO IRON LIKE IN WILL
