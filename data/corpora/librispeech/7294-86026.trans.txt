7294-86026-0000 THE SACRED MILK OF KOUMONGOE FAR WAY IN A VERY HOT COUNTRY THERE ONCE LIVED A MAN AND WOMAN WHO HAD TWO CHILDREN A SON NAMED KOANE AND A DAUGHTER
7294-86026-0001 EARLY IN THE MORNING AND LATE IN THE EVENINGS THE PARENTS WORKED HARD IN THE FIELDS RESTING WHEN THE SUN WAS HIGH UNDER THE SHADE OF SOME TREE WHILE THEY WERE ABSENT THE LITTLE GIRL KEPT HOUSE ALONE
7294-86026-0002 WHEN KOANE HAD SLEPT LATER THAN USUAL HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WENT TO THEIR WORK BEFORE HIM
7294-86026-0003 BUSY MAKING THE BREAD FOR SUPPER THAKANE HE SAID I AM THIRSTY GIVE ME A DRINK FROM THE TREE KOUMONGOE WHICH HAS THE BEST MILK IN THE WORLD OH KOANE CRIED HIS SISTER
7294-86026-0004 YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE FORBIDDEN TO TOUCH THAT TREE
7294-86026-0005 FOR HE WOULD BE SURE TO KNOW NONSENSE REPLIED KOANE THERE IS SO MUCH MILK IN KOUMONGOE THAT HE WILL NEVER MISS A LITTLE IF YOU WON'T GIVE IT TO ME I SHA'N'T TAKE THE CATTLE OUT
7294-86026-0006 THEY WILL JUST HAVE TO STAY ALL DAY IN THE HUT AND YOU KNOW THAT THEY WILL STARVE
7294-86026-0007 IT IS GETTING HOT HAD YOU BETTER DRIVE OUT THE CATTLE NOW BUT KOANE ONLY ANSWERED SULKILY I TOLD YOU I AM NOT GOING TO DRIVE THEM OUT AT ALL IF I HAVE TO DO WITHOUT MILK
7294-86026-0008 SHE WAS AFRAID TO DISOBEY HER PARENTS WHO WOULD MOST LIKELY BEAT HER YET THE BEASTS WOULD BE SURE TO SUFFER IF THEY WERE KEPT IN AND SHE WOULD PERHAPS BE BEATEN FOR THAT TOO SO AT LAST SHE TOOK AN AXE
7294-86026-0009 SHE CUT A VERY SMALL HOLE IN THE SIDE OF KOUMONGOE AND OUT GUSHED ENOUGH MILK TO FILL THE BOWL HERE IS THE MILK YOU WANTED SAID SHE GOING UP TO KOANE WHO WAS STILL SULKING IN HIS CORNER
7294-86026-0010 WHAT IS THE USE OF THAT GRUMBLED KOANE WHY THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TO DROWN A FLY GO AND GET ME THREE TIMES AS MUCH TREMBLING WITH FRIGHT
7294-86026-0011 AND STRUCK IT A SHARP BLOW WITH THE AXE IN AN INSTANT THERE POURED FORTH SUCH A STREAM OF MILK THAT IT RAN LIKE A RIVER INTO THE HUT
7294-86026-0012 AND SOON THE MILK WAS FLOWING THROUGH THE HUT DOWNHILL TOWARDS THEIR PARENTS IN THE FIELDS BELOW THE MAN SAW A WHITE STREAM A LONG WAY OFF AND GUESSED WHAT HAD HAPPENED WIFE WIFE HE CALLED LOUDLY TO THE WOMAN
7294-86026-0013 WHO WAS WORKING AT A LITTLE DISTANCE DO YOU SEE KOUMONGOE RUNNING FAST DOWN THE HILL THAT IS SOME MISCHIEF OF THE CHILDREN'S I AM SURE I MUST GO HOME AND FIND OUT WHAT IS THE MATTER AND THEY BOTH THREW DOWN THEIR HOES
7294-86026-0014 AND HURRIED TO THE SIDE OF KOUMONGOE KNEELING ON THE GRASS THE MAN AND HIS WIFE MADE A CUP OF THEIR HANDS AND DRANK THE MILK FROM IT AND NO SOONER HAD THEY DONE THIS THAN KOUMONGOE FLOWED BACK AGAIN UP THE HILL AND ENTERED THE HUT
7294-86026-0015 SAID THE PARENTS SEVERELY WHEN THEY REACHED HOME PANTING FROM THE HEAT OF THE SUN WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING WHY DID KOUMONGOE COME TO US IN THE FIELDS INSTEAD OF STAYING IN THE GARDEN IT WAS KOANE'S FAULT
7294-86026-0016 HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE CATTLE TO FEED UNTIL HE DRANK SOME OF THE MILK FROM KOUMONGOE SO AS I DID NOT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO I GAVE IT TO HIM
7294-86026-0017 BUT MADE NO ANSWER INSTEAD HE WENT OUTSIDE AND BROUGHT IN TWO SHEEPSKINS WHICH HE STAINED RED AND SENT FOR A BLACKSMITH TO FORGE SOME IRON RINGS
7294-86026-0018 THE RINGS WERE THEN PASSED OVER THAKANE'S ARMS AND LEGS AND NECK AND THE SKINS FASTENED ON HER BEFORE AND BEHIND WHEN ALL WAS READY THE MAN SENT FOR HIS SERVANTS AND SAID I AM GOING TO GET RID OF THAKANE
7294-86026-0019 GET RID OF YOUR ONLY DAUGHTER THEY ANSWERED IN SURPRISE BUT WHY BECAUSE SHE HAS EATEN WHAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE EATEN SHE HAS TOUCHED THE SACRED TREE WHICH BELONGS TO HER MOTHER AND ME ALONE AND TURNING HIS BACK
7294-86026-0020 AND THEY WENT DOWN THE ROAD WHICH LED TO THE DWELLING OF AN OGRE THEY WERE PASSING ALONG SOME FIELDS WHERE THE CORN WAS RIPENING WHEN A RABBIT SUDDENLY SPRANG OUT AT THEIR FEET AND STANDING ON ITS HIND LEGS IT SANG
7294-86026-0021 KOUMONGOE TO THE KEEPER OF BEASTS FOR WITHOUT KOUMONGOE THEY COULD NOT GO TO THE MEADOWS WITHOUT KOUMONGOE THEY WOULD STARVE IN THE HUT THAT WAS WHY I GAVE HIM THE KOUMONGOE OF MY FATHER AND WHEN THE RABBIT HEARD THAT HE CRIED
