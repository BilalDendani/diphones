4731-95870-0000 CHAPTER TEN CONTRACEPTIVES OR ABORTION SOCIETY HAS NOT YET LEARNED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE AGE LONG EFFORT OF THE FEMININE SPIRIT TO FREE ITSELF OF THE BURDEN OF EXCESSIVE CHILDBEARING
4731-95870-0001 IT HAS BEEN SINGULARLY BLIND TO THE REAL FORCES UNDERLYING THE CAUSE OF INFANTICIDE CHILD ABANDONMENT AND ABORTION IT HAS PERMITTED THE HIGHEST AND MOST POWERFUL THING IN WOMAN'S NATURE TO BE HINDERED DIVERTED REPRESSED AND CONFUSED
4731-95870-0002 SOCIETY HAS PERMITTED THIS INNER URGE OF WOMAN TO BE RENDERED VIOLENT BY REPRESSION UNTIL IT HAS EXPRESSED ITSELF IN CRUEL FORMS OF FAMILY LIMITATION WHICH THIS SAME SOCIETY HAS PROMPTLY LABELED CRIMES AND SOUGHT TO PUNISH IT HAS GONE ON BLINDLY FORCING WOMEN INTO THESE CRIMES
4731-95870-0003 DEAF ALIKE TO THEIR ENTREATIES AND TO THE LESSONS OF HISTORY AS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THIS BOOK CHILD ABANDONMENT AND INFANTICIDE ARE BY NO MEANS OBSOLETE PRACTICES AS FOR ABORTION IT HAS NOT DECREASED BUT INCREASED WITH THE ADVANCE OF CIVILIZATION
4731-95870-0004 WHILE ANOTHER ESTIMATES DOUBLE THAT NUMBER MOST OF THE WOMEN OF THE MIDDLE AND UPPER CLASSES IN AMERICA SEEM SECURE IN THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF CONTRACEPTIVES AS A MEANS OF BIRTH CONTROL UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS WHEN THE LAWS IN MOST STATES REGARD THIS KNOWLEDGE HOWSOEVER IT BE IMPARTED
4731-95870-0005 AS ILLICIT AND THE FEDERAL STATUTES PROHIBIT THE SENDING OF IT THROUGH THE MAILS EVEN THE WOMEN IN MORE FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES SOMETIMES HAVE DIFFICULTY IN GETTING SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION NEVERTHELESS SO STRONG IS THEIR PURPOSE THAT THEY DO OBTAIN IT AND USE IT CORRECTLY OR INCORRECTLY
4731-95870-0006 NEARLY ALL OF THESE WOMEN WILL FALL INTO ONE OF TWO GENERAL GROUPS THE ONES WHO ARE HAVING CHILDREN AGAINST THEIR WILLS AND THOSE WHO TO ESCAPE THIS EVIL FIND REFUGE IN ABORTION BEING GIVEN THEIR CHOICE BY SOCIETY TO CONTINUE TO BE OVERBURDENED MOTHERS
4731-95870-0007 PAINFUL AND TOO OFTEN GRAVELY DANGEROUS OPERATION THOSE WOMEN IN WHOM THE FEMININE URGE TO FREEDOM IS STRONGEST CHOOSE THE ABORTIONIST ONE GROUP GOES ON BRINGING CHILDREN TO BIRTH HOPING THAT THEY WILL BE BORN DEAD OR DIE
4731-95870-0008 THE WOMEN OF THE OTHER GROUP STRIVE CONSCIOUSLY BY DRASTIC MEANS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THE CHILDREN ALREADY BORN OUR EXAMINATIONS SAYS DOCTOR MAX HIRSCH AN AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT
4731-95870-0009 THIS FACT BRINGS US TO THE CONCLUSION THAT CONTRACEPTIVE MEASURES AMONG THE UPPER CLASSES AND THE PRACTICE OF ABORTION AMONG THE LOWER CLASS ARE THE REAL MEANS EMPLOYED TO REGULATE THE NUMBER OF OFFSPRING THUS A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN IN COMFORTABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
4731-95870-0010 ESCAPE OVERBREEDING BY THE USE OF CONTRACEPTIVES A SIMILARLY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN NOT IN COMFORTABLE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE FORCED TO SUBMIT TO FORCED MATERNITY BECAUSE THEIR ONLY ALTERNATIVE AT PRESENT IS ABORTION
4731-95870-0011 WHEN ACCIDENTAL CONCEPTION TAKES PLACE SOME WOMEN OF BOTH CLASSES RESORT TO ABORTION IF THEY CAN OBTAIN THE SERVICES OF AN ABORTIONIST WHEN SOCIETY HOLDS UP ITS HANDS IN HORROR AT THE CRIME OF ABORTION IT FORGETS AT WHOSE DOOR THE FIRST AND PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PRACTICE RESTS
4731-95870-0012 DOES ANYONE IMAGINE THAT A WOMAN WOULD SUBMIT TO ABORTION IF NOT DENIED THE KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENTIFIC EFFECTIVE CONTRACEPTIVES
4731-95870-0013 THE ABORTIONIST COULD NOT CONTINUE HIS PRACTICE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE FACT THAT WOMEN COME DESPERATELY BEGGING FOR SUCH OPERATIONS HE COULD NOT STAY OUT OF JAIL A DAY IF WOMEN DID NOT SO GENERALLY APPROVE OF HIS SERVICES
4731-95870-0014 WILL ALSO ENABLE US TO COMPREHEND MORE THOROUGHLY THE DANGERS TO WHICH WOMAN IS EXPOSED BY OUR ANTIQUATED LAWS AND HOW MUCH BETTER IT WOULD BE FOR HER TO EMPLOY SUCH PREVENTIVE MEASURES
4731-95870-0015 INTO WHICH THE LAWS NOW DRIVE HER
4731-95870-0016 AT A CERTAIN AGE VARYING SLIGHTLY WITH THE INDIVIDUAL
4731-95870-0017 AND PASSES OUT OF THE BODY WHEN THIS TAKES PLACE IT IS SAID THAT THE GIRL IS AT THE AGE OF PUBERTY WHEN IT REACHES THE WOMB THE OVULE IS READY FOR THE PROCESS OF CONCEPTION THAT IS FERTILIZATION BY THE MALE SPERM
4731-95870-0018 IF FERTILIZATION TAKES PLACE THE FERTILIZED OVULE OR OVUM WILL CLING TO THE LINING OF THE WOMB AND THERE GATHER ITS NOURISHMENT IF FERTILIZATION DOES NOT TAKE PLACE THE OVUM PASSES OUT OF THE BODY AND THE UTERUS THROWS OFF ITS SURPLUS BLOOD SUPPLY
4731-95870-0019 THIS IS CALLED THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD IT OCCURS ABOUT ONCE A MONTH OR EVERY TWENTY EIGHT DAYS IN THE MALE ORGANS THERE ARE GLANDS CALLED TESTES THEY SECRETE A FLUID CALLED THE SEMEN IN THE SEMEN IS THE LIFE GIVING PRINCIPLE CALLED THE SPERM
4731-95870-0020 WHEN INTERCOURSE TAKES PLACE IF NO PREVENTIVE IS EMPLOYED THE SEMEN IS DEPOSITED IN THE WOMAN'S VAGINA THE OVULE IS NOT IN THE VAGINA BUT IS IN THE WOMB FARTHER UP OR PERHAPS IN THE TUBE ON ITS WAY TO THE WOMB
4731-95870-0021 SEVERAL OF THESE SPERM CELLS START BUT ONLY ONE ENTERS THE OVUM AND IS ABSORBED INTO IT THIS PROCESS IS CALLED FERTILIZATION CONCEPTION OR IMPREGNATION IF NO CHILDREN ARE DESIRED THE MEETING OF THE MALE SPERM AND THE OVUM MUST BE PREVENTED
4731-95870-0022 WHEN SCIENTIFIC MEANS ARE EMPLOYED TO PREVENT THIS MEETING ONE IS SAID TO PRACTICE BIRTH CONTROL THE MEANS USED IS KNOWN AS A CONTRACEPTIVE
4731-95870-0023 ANY ATTEMPT AT REMOVING IT OR STOPPING ITS FURTHER GROWTH IS CALLED ABORTION THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WOMEN ARE APT TO LOOK UPON ABORTION AS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE AND TO TREAT IT ACCORDINGLY
4731-95870-0024 AN ABORTION IS AS IMPORTANT A MATTER AS A CONFINEMENT AND REQUIRES AS MUCH ATTENTION AS THE BIRTH OF A CHILD AT ITS FULL TERM THE IMMEDIATE DANGERS OF ABORTION SAYS DOCTOR J CLIFTON EDGAR IN HIS BOOK THE PRACTICE OF OBSTETRICS
4731-95870-0025 ARE HEMORRHAGE RETENTION OF AN ADHERENT PLACENTA SEPSIS TETANUS PERFORATION OF THE UTERUS THEY ALSO CAUSE STERILITY ANEMIA MALIGNANT DISEASES DISPLACEMENTS NEUROSIS AND ENDOMETRITIS IN PLAIN EVERYDAY LANGUAGE
4731-95870-0026 IT IS ONLY THE WOMEN OF WEALTH WHO CAN AFFORD THE BEST MEDICAL SKILL CARE AND TREATMENT
4731-95870-0027 IN THIS WAY THEY ESCAPE THE USUAL SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES THE WOMEN WHOSE INCOMES ARE LIMITED AND WHO MUST CONTINUE AT WORK BEFORE THEY HAVE RECOVERED FROM THE EFFECTS OF AN ABORTION ARE THE GREAT ARMY OF SUFFERERS IT IS AMONG SUCH THAT THE DEATHS DUE TO ABORTION USUALLY ENSUE
4731-95870-0028 IT IS THESE TOO WHO ARE MOST OFTEN FORCED TO RESORT TO SUCH OPERATIONS IF DEATH DOES NOT RESULT THE WOMAN WHO HAS UNDERGONE AN ABORTION IS NOT ALTOGETHER SAFE FROM HARM
4731-95870-0029 THE WOMB MAY NOT RETURN TO ITS NATURAL SIZE BUT REMAIN LARGE AND HEAVY TENDING TO FALL AWAY FROM ITS NATURAL POSITION ABORTION OFTEN LEAVES THE UTERUS IN A CONDITION TO CONCEIVE EASILY AGAIN AND UNLESS PREVENTION IS STRICTLY FOLLOWED ANOTHER PREGNANCY WILL SURELY OCCUR
4731-95870-0030 THESE AND OTHER CONDITIONS ARISING FROM SUCH OPERATIONS ARE VERY LIKELY TO RUIN A WOMAN'S GENERAL HEALTH
4731-95870-0031 WHILE THERE ARE CASES WHERE EVEN THE LAW RECOGNIZES AN ABORTION AS JUSTIFIABLE IF RECOMMENDED BY A PHYSICIAN I ASSERT THAT THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ABORTIONS PERFORMED IN AMERICA EACH YEAR ARE A DISGRACE TO CIVILIZATION
4731-95870-0032 THE EFFECTS OF SUCH OPERATIONS UPON A WOMAN SERIOUS AS THEY MAY BE ARE NOTHING AS COMPARED TO THE INJURY DONE HER GENERAL HEALTH BY DRUGS TAKEN TO PRODUCE THE SAME RESULT EVEN SUCH DRUGS AS ARE PRESCRIBED BY PHYSICIANS HAVE HARMFUL EFFECTS
4731-95870-0033 AND NOSTRUMS RECOMMENDED BY DRUGGISTS ARE OFTEN WORSE STILL EVEN MORE DRASTIC MAY BE THE EFFECT UPON THE UNBORN CHILD
4731-95870-0034 ONLY TO DECIDE AT LAST WHEN DRUGS HAVE FAILED AS THEY USUALLY DO TO BRING THE CHILD TO BIRTH THERE ARE NO STATISTICS OF COURSE BY WHICH WE MAY COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF SUFFERING TO MOTHER AND CHILD FROM THE USE OF SUCH DRUGS
4731-95870-0035 BUT WE KNOW THAT THE TOTAL OF PHYSICAL WEAKNESS AND DISEASE MUST BE ASTOUNDING WE KNOW THAT THE WOMAN'S OWN SYSTEM FEELS THE STRAIN OF THESE DRUGS AND THAT THE EMBRYO IS USUALLY POISONED BY THEM THE CHILD IS LIKELY TO BE
4731-95870-0036 CONCERNING THE PREVENTING OF CONCEPTION ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DEATHS EACH YEAR IN THIS COUNTRY AND AN UNTOLD AMOUNT OF SICKNESS AND SORROW THE SUFFERING AND THE DEATH OF THESE WOMEN IS SQUARELY UPON THE HEADS OF THE LAWMAKERS AND THE PURITANICAL
4731-95870-0037 MASCULINE MINDED PERSON WHO INSIST UPON RETAINING THE ABOMINABLE LEGAL RESTRICTIONS TRY AS THEY WILL THEY CANNOT ESCAPE THE TRUTH NOR HIDE IT UNDER THE CLOAK OF STUPID HYPOCRISY IF THE LAWS AGAINST IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENTIFIC BIRTH CONTROL WERE REPEALED
4731-95870-0038 NEARLY ALL OF THE ONE MILLION OR TWO MILLION WOMEN WHO UNDERGO ABORTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES EACH YEAR
4731-95870-0039 SUFFERING AND DEATH WHICH SO OFTEN FOLLOWS HE WHO WOULD COMBAT ABORTION SAYS DOCTOR HIRSCH AND AT THE SAME TIME COMBAT CONTRACEPTIVE MEASURES MAY BE LIKENED TO THE PERSON WHO WOULD FIGHT CONTAGIOUS DISEASES AND FORBID DISINFECTION
4731-95870-0040 FOR CONTRACEPTIVE MEASURES ARE IMPORTANT WEAPONS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ABORTION AMERICA HAS A LAW SINCE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE WHICH PROHIBITS BY CRIMINAL STATUTE THE DISTRIBUTION AND REGULATION OF CONTRACEPTIVE MEASURES
4731-95870-0041 IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE THAT AMERICA STANDS AT THE HEAD OF ALL NATIONS IN THE HUGE NUMBER OF ABORTIONS THERE IS THE CASE IN A NUTSHELL FAMILY LIMITATION WILL ALWAYS BE PRACTICED AS IT IS NOW BEING PRACTICED EITHER BY BIRTH CONTROL OR BY ABORTION WE KNOW THAT
4731-95870-0042 THE ONE MEANS HEALTH AND HAPPINESS A STRONGER BETTER RACE THE OTHER MEANS DISEASE SUFFERING DEATH THE WOMAN WHO GOES TO THE ABORTIONIST'S TABLE IS NOT A CRIMINAL BUT A MARTYR A MARTYR TO THE BITTER UNTHINKABLE CONDITIONS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE BLINDNESS OF SOCIETY AT LARGE
4731-95870-0043 THESE CONDITIONS GIVE HER THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE SURGEON'S INSTRUMENTS AND THE SACRIFICING OF WHAT IS HIGHEST AND HOLIEST IN HER HER ASPIRATION TO FREEDOM HER DESIRE TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN ALREADY HERS THESE CONDITIONS NOT THE WOMAN OUTFACE SOCIETY WITH THIS QUESTION
