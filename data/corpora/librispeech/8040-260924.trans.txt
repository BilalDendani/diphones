8040-260924-0000 DROPPING HAT AND CANVAS LANYARD GAVE CHASE AND OVERHAULED THE MARAUDER AS HE WAS CLAMBERING OUT THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW WHERE A FIRM HAND ON HIS COLLAR CHECKED HIS PREPARATIONS TO DROP HALF A DOZEN FEET TO THE FLAGGED COURT
8040-260924-0001 SO THE VIRTUOUS HOUSEHOLDER WAS RATHER MORE THAN UNCEREMONIOUS ABOUT YANKING THE PRINCELY HOUSEBREAKER INSIDE AND LENDING HIM A FOOT TO ACCELERATE HIS RETURN TO THE LIVING ROOM WHERE VICTOR BROUGHT UP ON ALL FOURS AGAIN
8040-260924-0002 IN ALMOST PRECISELY THE SPOT FROM WHICH HE HAD RISEN HE BOUNCED UP HOWEVER WITH A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF ANIMATION AND AMBITION AND FLEW BACK TO THE OFFENSIVE WITH FLAILING FISTS
8040-260924-0003 IN THIS HIS JUDGMENT WAS GRIEVOUSLY IN FAULT LANYARD SIDESTEPPED NIPPED A WRIST TWITCHED IT SMARTLY UP BETWEEN THE MAN'S SHOULDER BLADES WITH A WRENCH THAT WON A GRUNT OF AGONY CAUGHT THE OTHER ARM FROM BEHIND BY THE HOLLOW OF ITS ELBOW AND HELD HIS VICTIM HELPLESS THOUGH ILL ADVISED ENOUGH TO CONTINUE TO HISS AND SPIT AND SQUIRM AND KICK
8040-260924-0004 WHEN IT WAS SUSPENDED HE WAS BREATHLESS BUT THOUGHTFUL AND OFFERED NO OBJECTION TO BEING SEARCHED
8040-260924-0005 LANYARD RELIEVED HIM OF A REVOLVER AND A DIRK THEN WITH A PUSH SENT VICTOR REELING TO THE TABLE WHERE HE STOOD PANTING QUIVERING AND GLARING MURDER WHILE HIS CAPTOR PUT THE DAGGER AWAY AND EXAMINED THE FIREARM WICKED THING
8040-260924-0006 HE COMMENTED LOADED TOO REALLY MONSIEUR LE PRINCE SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL ONE OF THESE FINE DAYS IF YOU DON'T STOP PLAYING WITH SUCH WEAPONS

8040-260924-0011 HIS HEAD WAS STILL HEAVY HOT AND PAINFUL HIS MENTAL PROCESSES THICK WITH LEES OF COMA BUT NOW HE BEGAN TO APPRECIATE WHAT NATURALLY SEEMED APPARENT THAT LANYARD MUST BE UNACQUAINTED WITH THE CAUSE OF HIS INJURIES
8040-260924-0012 A SEARCHING LOOK ROUND THE ROOM CONFIRMED HIM IN THIS ERROR THE CANVAS LAY WHERE LANYARD HAD DROPPED IT ON ENTERING NOT IN THE SPOT WHERE VICTOR REMEMBERED SEEING IT LAST BUT WHERE CONCEIVABLY AN UNHEEDED KICK MIGHT HAVE SENT IT IN THE COURSE OF HIS STRUGGLE WITH SOFIA
8040-260924-0013 SHE MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN IT THEN WHEN SHE FLED FROM WHAT SHE PROBABLY THOUGHT WAS MURDER AND WHAT MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN
8040-260924-0014 HE WAS MUCH TOO SORE AND SHAKEN TO BE SUBTLE AND THE GENERAL TREND OF HIS CONJECTURES WAS PERFECTLY LEGIBLE TO LANYARD WHO WITHOUT DELAY SET HIMSELF TO CONJURE AWAY ANY LINGERING SUSPICION OF HIS GUILELESSNESS NOT
