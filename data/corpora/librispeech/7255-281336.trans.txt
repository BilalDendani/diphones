7255-281336-0000 LET US KNOCK HERE SAID THE SHREWD BAT I KNOW THE OLD FELLOW IS NOT ASLEEP THIS IS HIS PROWLING HOUR AND BUT THAT IT IS A STORMY NIGHT HE WOULD BE ABROAD HUNTING WHAT HO MASTER OWL HE SQUEAKED
7255-281336-0001 WILL YOU LET IN TWO STORM TOSSED TRAVELERS FOR A NIGHT'S LODGING GRUFFLY THE SELFISH OLD OWL BADE THEM ENTER AND GRUDGINGLY INVITED THEM TO SHARE HIS SUPPER
7255-281336-0002 THE POOR DOVE WAS SO TIRED THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY EAT BUT THE GREEDY BAT'S SPIRITS ROSE AS SOON AS HE SAW THE VIANDS SPREAD BEFORE HIM
7255-281336-0003 AND HIS GENEROSITY THOUGH EVERY ONE KNEW THAT HOWEVER WISE OLD MASTER OWL MIGHT BE HE WAS NEITHER BRAVE NOR GALLANT AS FOR HIS GENEROSITY
7255-281336-0004 THE LITTLE FIRE BRINGER A FEATHER TO HELP COVER HIS SCORCHED AND SHIVERING BODY
7255-281336-0005 ALL THIS FLATTERY PLEASED THE OWL HE PUFFED AND RUFFLED HIMSELF TRYING TO LOOK AS WISE GALLANT AND BRAVE AS POSSIBLE HE PRESSED THE BAT TO HELP HIMSELF MORE GENEROUSLY TO THE VIANDS WHICH INVITATION THE SLY FELLOW WAS NOT SLOW TO ACCEPT
7255-281336-0006 SUDDENLY THE OWL TURNED TO HER AS FOR YOU MISS PINK EYES HE SAID GRUFFLY YOU KEEP CAREFUL SILENCE YOU ARE A DULL TABLE COMPANION
7255-281336-0007 PRAY HAVE YOU NOTHING TO SAY FOR YOURSELF YES EXCLAIMED THE MISCHIEVOUS BAT HAVE YOU NO WORDS OF PRAISE FOR OUR KIND HOST
7255-281336-0008 METHINKS HE DESERVES SOME RETURN FOR THIS WONDERFULLY GENEROUS AGREEABLE TASTEFUL WELL APPOINTED LUXURIOUS ELEGANT AND ALTOGETHER ACCEPTABLE BANQUET WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY O LITTLE DOVE
7255-281336-0009 BUT THE DOVE HUNG HER HEAD ASHAMED OF HER COMPANION AND SAID VERY SIMPLY O MASTER OWL I CAN ONLY THANK YOU WITH ALL MY HEART FOR THE HOSPITALITY AND SHELTER WHICH YOU HAVE GIVEN ME THIS NIGHT
7255-281336-0010 I WAS BEATEN BY THE STORM AND YOU TOOK ME IN I WAS HUNGRY AND YOU GAVE ME YOUR BEST TO EAT I CANNOT FLATTER NOR MAKE PRETTY SPEECHES LIKE THE BAT I NEVER LEARNED SUCH MANNERS

7255-281336-0013 THE DOVE REMAINED SILENT LIKE CORDELIA IN THE PLAY SHE COULD NOT SPEAK UNTRUTHS EVEN FOR HER OWN HAPPINESS
7255-281336-0014 YOU ARE AN UNGRATEFUL BIRD MISS AND THE BAT IS RIGHT YOU DO NOT DESERVE THIS GENEROUS HOSPITALITY WHICH I HAVE OFFERED THIS GOODLY SHELTER WHICH YOU ASKED AWAY WITH YOU
7255-281336-0015 LEAVE MY DWELLING PACK OFF INTO THE STORM AND SEE WHETHER OR NOT YOUR SILENCE WILL SOOTHE THE RAIN AND THE WIND BE OFF I SAY
7255-281336-0016 HER ECHOED THE BAT FLAPPING HIS LEATHERY WINGS AND THE TWO HEARTLESS CREATURES FELL UPON THE POOR LITTLE DOVE AND DROVE HER OUT INTO THE DARK AND STORMY NIGHT
7255-281336-0017 ALL NIGHT SHE WAS TOSSED AND BEATEN ABOUT SHELTERLESS IN THE STORM BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN TOO TRUTHFUL TO FLATTER THE VAIN OLD OWL BUT WHEN THE BRIGHT MORNING DAWNED DRAGGLED AND WEARY AS SHE WAS SHE FLEW TO THE COURT OF KING EAGLE
7255-281336-0018 AND TOLD HIM ALL HER TROUBLE GREAT WAS THE INDIGNATION OF THAT NOBLE BIRD FOR HIS FLATTERY AND HIS CRUELTY LET THE BAT NEVER PRESUME TO FLY ABROAD UNTIL THE SUN GOES DOWN HE CRIED
7255-281336-0019 AS FOR THE OWL I HAVE ALREADY DOOMED HIM TO THIS PUNISHMENT FOR HIS TREATMENT OF THE WREN BUT HENCEFORTH LET NO BIRD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH EITHER OF THEM THE BAT OR THE OWL
7255-281336-0020 LET THEM BE OUTCASTS AND NIGHT PROWLERS ENEMIES TO BE ATTACKED AND PUNISHED IF THEY APPEAR AMONG US TO BE AVOIDED BY ALL IN THEIR LONELINESS
7255-281336-0021 FLATTERY AND INHOSPITALITY DECEIT AND CRUELTY WHAT ARE MORE HIDEOUS THAN THESE LET THEM COVER THEMSELVES IN DARKNESS AND SHUN THE HAPPY LIGHT OF DAY
