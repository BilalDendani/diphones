8671-285138-0049 AS FOR SIR PATHRICK O'GRANDISON BARRONITT IT WASN'T FOR THE LIKES OF HIS RIVERENCE TO BE AFTHER THE MINDING OF A THRIFLE OF A MISTAKE YE MAY JIST SAY THOUGH
8671-285138-0050 FOR IT'S GOD'S THRUTH THAT AFORE I LEFT HOULD OF THE FLIPPER OF THE SPALPEEN
8671-285138-0051 WOULLY WOU SAYS HE PULLY WOU SAYS HE
8671-285138-0052 IN AN EQUAL DEGREE SKILLED IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF THAT PERIOD IS I PRESUME STILL MORE ESPECIALLY UNDENIABLE
8671-285138-0053 BUT WHAT PEN CAN DO JUSTICE TO HIS ESSAYS SUR LA NATURE HIS THOUGHTS SUR L'AME
8671-285138-0054 IF HIS OMELETTES
8671-285138-0055 OF THAT DAY WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN TWICE AS MUCH FOR AN
8671-285138-0056 BON BON HAD RANSACKED LIBRARIES WHICH NO OTHER MAN HAD RANSACKED HAD MORE THAN ANY OTHER WOULD HAVE ENTERTAINED A NOTION OF READING HAD UNDERSTOOD MORE THAN ANY OTHER WOULD HAVE CONCEIVED THE POSSIBILITY OF UNDERSTANDING
8671-285138-0057 AND ALTHOUGH WHILE HE FLOURISHED
8671-285138-0058 THAT HIS DICTA EVINCED NEITHER THE PURITY OF THE ACADEMY NOR THE DEPTH OF THE LYCEUM ALTHOUGH MARK ME HIS DOCTRINES WERE BY NO MEANS VERY GENERALLY COMPREHENDED STILL
8671-285138-0059 IT DID NOT FOLLOW THAT THEY WERE DIFFICULT OF COMPREHENSION
8671-285138-0060 IT IS TO BON BON BUT LET THIS GO NO FARTHER IT IS TO BON BON THAT KANT HIMSELF IS MAINLY INDEBTED FOR HIS METAPHYSICS THE FORMER WAS INDEED NOT A PLATONIST
8671-285138-0061 NOR STRICTLY SPEAKING AN ARISTOTELIAN NOR DID HE
8671-285138-0062 OF A FRICASEE OR
8671-285138-0063 THE ANALYSIS OF A SENSATION IN FRIVOLOUS ATTEMPTS AT RECONCILING THE OBSTINATE OILS AND WATERS OF ETHICAL DISCUSSION NOT AT ALL BON BON WAS IONIC
8671-285138-0064 HE REASONED ALSO A POSTERIORI
8671-285138-0065 HE BELIEVED IN GEORGE OF TREBIZONDE HE BELIEVED IN BOSSARION
8671-285138-0066 BESSARION BON BON WAS EMPHATICALLY A BON BONIST I HAVE SPOKEN OF THE PHILOSOPHER IN HIS CAPACITY OF RESTAURATEUR I WOULD NOT
8671-285138-0067 AND IMPORTANCE FAR FROM IT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY IN WHICH BRANCH OF HIS PROFESSION HE TOOK THE GREATER PRIDE IN HIS OPINION
8671-285138-0068 THE POWERS OF THE INTELLECT HELD INTIMATE CONNECTION WITH THE CAPABILITIES OF THE STOMACH I AM NOT SURE INDEED THAT HE GREATLY DISAGREED WITH THE CHINESE WHO HELD
8671-285138-0069 BY THIS I DO NOT MEAN TO INSINUATE A CHARGE OF GLUTTONY OR INDEED ANY OTHER SERIOUS CHARGE TO THE PREJUDICE OF THE METAPHYSICIAN IF PIERRE BON BON HAD HIS FAILINGS AND WHAT GREAT MAN HAS NOT A THOUSAND IF PIERRE
8671-285138-0070 BON BON I SAY HAD HIS FAILINGS THEY WERE FAILINGS OF VERY LITTLE IMPORTANCE FAULTS INDEED WHICH IN OTHER TEMPERS HAVE OFTEN BEEN LOOKED UPON RATHER IN THE LIGHT OF VIRTUES
8671-285138-0071 THAT THE BARGAIN SHOULD BE TO HIS OWN PROPER ADVANTAGE PROVIDED A TRADE COULD BE EFFECTED A TRADE OF ANY KIND UPON ANY TERMS OR UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
8671-285138-0072 A TRIUMPHANT SMILE WAS SEEN FOR MANY DAYS THEREAFTER TO ENLIGHTEN HIS COUNTENANCE AND A KNOWING WINK OF THE EYE TO GIVE EVIDENCE OF HIS SAGACITY
8671-285138-0073 SHOULD ELICIT ATTENTION AND REMARK
8671-285138-0074 HAD THIS PECULIARITY NOT ATTRACTED OBSERVATION
8671-285138-0075 IT WAS SOON REPORTED THAT UPON ALL OCCASIONS OF THE KIND THE SMILE OF BON BON WAS WONT TO DIFFER WIDELY FROM THE DOWNRIGHT GRIN WITH WHICH HE WOULD LAUGH AT HIS OWN JOKES OR WELCOME AN ACQUAINTANCE
8671-285138-0076 HINTS WERE THROWN OUT OF AN EXCITING NATURE STORIES WERE TOLD OF PERILOUS BARGAINS MADE IN A HURRY AND REPENTED OF AT LEISURE
8671-285138-0077 FOR WISE PURPOSES OF HIS OWN THE PHILOSOPHER HAD OTHER WEAKNESSES BUT THEY ARE SCARCELY WORTHY OUR SERIOUS EXAMINATION FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE FEW MEN OF EXTRAORDINARY PROFUNDITY
8671-285138-0078 WHO ARE FOUND WANTING IN AN INCLINATION FOR THE BOTTLE WHETHER THIS INCLINATION BE AN EXCITING CAUSE OR RATHER A VALID PROOF OF SUCH PROFUNDITY IT IS A NICE THING TO SAY
8671-285138-0079 NOR DO I YET IN THE INDULGENCE OF A PROPENSITY SO TRULY CLASSICAL IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT THE RESTAURATEUR WOULD LOSE SIGHT OF THAT INTUITIVE DISCRIMINATION
8671-285138-0080 WHICH WAS WONT TO CHARACTERIZE AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME HIS ESSAIS AND HIS OMELETTES
8671-285138-0081 THERE WERE APPROPRIATE MOMENTS FOR THE COTES DU RHONE
8671-285138-0082 HE WOULD SPORT WITH A SYLLOGISM IN SIPPING SAINT PERAY
8671-285138-0083 WELL HAD IT BEEN IF THE SAME QUICK SENSE OF PROPRIETY HAD ATTENDED HIM IN THE PEDDLING PROPENSITY TO WHICH I HAVE FORMERLY ALLUDED BUT THIS WAS BY NO MEANS THE CASE
8671-285138-0084 INDEED TO SAY THE TRUTH THAT TRAIT OF MIND IN THE PHILOSOPHIC BON BON
8671-285138-0085 OF STRANGE INTENSITY AND MYSTICISM
8671-285138-0086 TO ENTER THE SANCTUM OF A MAN OF GENIUS BON BON WAS A MAN OF GENIUS THERE WAS NOT A SOUS CUSINIER IN ROUEN WHO COULD NOT HAVE TOLD YOU THAT BON BON WAS A MAN
8671-285138-0087 OF GENIUS HIS VERY CAT KNEW IT AND FOREBORE TO WHISK HER TAIL IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MAN OF GENIUS HIS LARGE WATER DOG WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THE FACT AND UPON THE APPROACH OF HIS MASTER
8671-285138-0088 BETRAYED HIS SENSE OF INFERIORITY BY A SANCTITY OF DEPORTMENT
8671-285138-0089 NOT ALTOGETHER UNWORTHY OF A DOG IT IS HOWEVER TRUE THAT MUCH OF THIS HABITUAL RESPECT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE PERSONAL APPEARANCE OF THE METAPHYSICIAN A DISTINGUISHED EXTERIOR WILL
8671-285138-0090 I AM CONSTRAINED TO SAY HAVE ITS WAY EVEN WITH A BEAST AND I AM WILLING TO ALLOW MUCH IN THE OUTWARD MAN OF THE RESTAURATEUR CALCULATED TO IMPRESS THE IMAGINATION OF THE QUADRUPED
8671-285138-0091 IF I MAY BE PERMITTED SO EQUIVOCAL AN EXPRESSION WHICH MERE PHYSICAL BULK ALONE WILL BE FOUND AT ALL TIMES INEFFICIENT IN CREATING IF HOWEVER BON BON WAS BARELY THREE FEET IN HEIGHT
8671-285138-0092 AND IF HIS HEAD WAS DIMINUTIVELY SMALL STILL IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BEHOLD THE ROTUNDITY OF HIS STOMACH WITHOUT A SENSE OF MAGNIFICENCE NEARLY BORDERING UPON THE SUBLIME
8671-285138-0093 IN ITS SIZE BOTH DOGS AND MEN MUST HAVE SEEN A TYPE OF HIS ACQUIREMENTS IN ITS IMMENSITY A FITTING HABITATION FOR HIS IMMORTAL SOUL I MIGHT HERE IF IT SO PLEASED ME
8671-285138-0094 DILATE UPON THE MATTER OF HABILIMENT AND OTHER MERE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE EXTERNAL METAPHYSICIAN I MIGHT HINT THAT THE HAIR OF OUR HERO WAS WORN SHORT COMBED SMOOTHLY OVER HIS FOREHEAD
8671-285138-0095 AND SURMOUNTED BY A CONICAL SHAPED WHITE FLANNEL CAP AND TASSELS THAT HIS PEA GREEN JERKIN WAS NOT AFTER THE FASHION OF THOSE WORN BY THE COMMON CLASS OF RESTAURATEURS AT THAT DAY THAT THE SLEEVES WERE SOMETHING FULLER
8671-285138-0096 THAN THE REIGNING COSTUME PERMITTED THAT THE CUFFS WERE TURNED UP NOT AS USUAL IN THAT BARBAROUS PERIOD WITH CLOTH OF THE SAME QUALITY AND COLOR AS THE GARMENT BUT FACED IN A MORE FANCIFUL MANNER WITH THE PARTICOLORED VELVET OF GENOA
8671-285138-0097 AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN BUT FOR THE EXQUISITE POINTING OF THE TOES AND THE BRILLIANT TINTS OF THE BINDING AND EMBROIDERY
8671-285138-0098 CALLED AIMABLE THAT HIS SKY BLUE CLOAK RESEMBLING IN FORM A DRESSING WRAPPER AND RICHLY BESTUDDED ALL OVER WITH CRIMSON DEVICES FLOATED CAVALIERLY UPON HIS SHOULDERS LIKE A MIST OF THE MORNING
8671-285138-0099 AND THAT HIS TOUT ENSEMBLE GAVE RISE TO THE REMARKABLE WORDS OF BENEVENUTA THE IMPROVISATRICE OF FLORENCE
8671-285138-0100 OR RATHER A VERY PARADISE OF PERFECTION I MIGHT I SAY EXPATIATE UPON ALL THESE POINTS IF I PLEASED BUT I FORBEAR MERELY PERSONAL DETAILS MAY BE LEFT TO HISTORICAL NOVELISTS
8671-285138-0101 I HAVE SAID
8671-285138-0102 BUT THEN IT WAS ONLY THE MAN OF GENIUS WHO COULD DULY ESTIMATE THE MERITS OF THE SANCTUM A SIGN CONSISTING OF A VAST FOLIO SWUNG BEFORE THE ENTRANCE
8671-285138-0103 ON ONE SIDE OF THE VOLUME WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE ON THE REVERSE A PATE ON THE BACK WERE VISIBLE IN LARGE LETTERS
8671-285138-0104 THUS WAS DELICATELY SHADOWED FORTH THE TWO FOLD OCCUPATION OF THE PROPRIETOR UPON STEPPING OVER THE THRESHOLD THE WHOLE INTERIOR OF THE BUILDING PRESENTED ITSELF TO VIEW
8671-285138-0105 A LONG LOW PITCHED ROOM OF ANTIQUE CONSTRUCTION WAS INDEED ALL THE ACCOMMODATION AFFORDED BY THE CAFE IN A CORNER OF THE APARTMENT STOOD THE BED OF THE METAPHYSICIAN
8671-285138-0106 AND COMFORTABLE IN THE CORNER DIAGONARY OPPOSITE APPEARED IN DIRECT FAMILY COMMUNION THE PROPERTIES OF THE KITCHEN AND THE BIBLIOTHEQUE A DISH OF POLEMICS STOOD PEACEFULLY UPON THE DRESSER
8671-285138-0107 HERE LAY AN OVENFUL OF THE LATEST ETHICS
8671-285138-0108 AND CONTEMPORARY MANUSCRIPTS WERE FILED AWAY UPON THE SPIT IN OTHER RESPECTS THE CAFE DE BON BON MIGHT BE SAID TO DIFFER LITTLE FROM THE USUAL RESTAURANTS OF THE PERIOD A FIREPLACE YAWNED OPPOSITE THE DOOR
8671-285138-0109 IT WAS HERE ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK ONE NIGHT DURING THE SEVERE WINTER THE COMMENTS OF HIS NEIGHBOURS UPON HIS SINGULAR PROPENSITY THAT PIERRE BON BON I SAY HAVING TURNED THEM ALL OUT OF HIS HOUSE LOCKED THE DOOR
8671-285138-0110 UPON THEM WITH AN OATH AND BETOOK HIMSELF IN NO VERY PACIFIC MOOD TO THE COMFORTS OF A LEATHER BOTTOMED ARM CHAIR AND A FIRE OF BLAZING FAGOTS
