8066-114256-0011 BELOW AGAIN LAY THE BARED BED OF THE EXPLOITED WATER COURSE FLOORED WITH BOWLDERS SET IN DEEP GRAVEL AT TIMES WITH SEAMY DAMS OF FLAT ROCK LYING UNDER AND ACROSS THE GRAVEL STRETCHES THE BED ROCK AGES OLD
8066-114256-0012 HOLDING IN ITS HIDDEN FINGERS THE RICH SECRETS OF IMMEMORIAL TIME
8066-114256-0013 AND UNIMPORTANT RIVULET MORE WEALTH THAN MOST COULD SAVE IN A LIFETIME OF PATIENT AND THRIFTY TOIL YES FORTUNE HAD BEEN KIND
8066-114256-0014 SO UNAGITATING SO MATTER OF FACT THE HILLSIDE NOW LOOKED LIKE ANY OTHER HILLSIDE INNOCENT AS A WOMAN'S EYES YET COVERING HOW MUCH BANION COULD NOT REALIZE THAT NOW YOUNG THOUGH HE WAS
8066-114256-0015 HE WAS A RICH MAN HE CLIMBED DOWN THE SIDE OF THE RAVINE THE LITTLE STONES RATTLING UNDER HIS FEET
8066-114256-0016 THERE WAS A SHARP BEND IN THE RAVINE AND HERE THE UNPAID TOIL OF THE LITTLE WATERWAY HAD AGES LONG CARRIED AND LEFT ESPECIALLY DEEP STRATA OF GOLD SHOT GRAVEL
8066-114256-0017 HE HASTENED TO GET VIEW OF THE CAUSE WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE AND THEN FATE CHANCE THE GODDESS OF FORTUNE WHICH SOME MEN SAY DOES NOT EXIST BUT WHICH ALL WILDERNESS GOERS KNOW DOES EXIST FOR ONE INSTANT PAUSED
8066-114256-0018 NOT UNHANDSOME BUT EVIL IN ITS PLAIN MEANING NOW THE EYES WERE NARROWED THE FULL LIPS DRAWN CLOSE AS THOUGH SOME TENSE EMOTION NOW APPROACHED ITS CLIMAX THE APPEARANCE WAS THAT OF STRAIN
8066-114256-0019 OF NERVES STRETCHED IN SOME PURPOSE LONG SUSTAINED AND WHY NOT WHEN A MAN WOULD DO MURDER
8066-114256-0020 THAT PURPOSE ITSELF CHANGES HIS VERY LINEAMENTS ALTERS HIS WHOLE CAST OF COUNTENANCE OTHER MEN AVOID HIM KNOWING UNCONSCIOUSLY WHAT IS IN HIS SOUL BECAUSE OF WHAT IS WRITTEN ON HIS FACE
8066-114256-0021 FOR MONTHS MOST MEN HAD AVOIDED WOODHULL IT WAS KNOWN THAT HE WAS ON A MAN HUNT HIS QUESTIONS HIS MOVEMENTS HIS CHANGES OF LOCALITY SHOWED THAT AND WOODHULL WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO CANNOT AVOID ASSEVERANCE
8066-114256-0022 NEEDING IT FOR THEIR COURAGE SAKE NOW MOROSE AND BROODING NOW LOUDLY PROFANE NOW LAUGHING OR NOW ALOOF HIS ERRAND IN THESE UNKNOWN HILLS WAS PLAIN WELL
8066-114256-0023 HERE STOOD HIS ENEMY UNARMED DELIVERED INTO HIS HANDS FOR ONE INSTANT THE TWO STOOD STARING INTO ONE ANOTHER'S EYES BANION'S ADVANCE HAD BEEN SILENT WOODHULL WAS TAKEN AS MUCH UNAWARES AS HE
8066-114256-0024 IT HAD BEEN WOODHULL'S PURPOSE TO GET A STAND ABOVE THE SLUICES HIDDEN BY THE ANGLE WHERE HE COULD COMMAND THE REACH OF THE STREAM BED WHERE BANION AND JACKSON LAST HAD BEEN WORKING HE HAD STUDIED THE PLACE BEFORE AND MEANT TO TAKE NO CHANCES
8066-114256-0025 AT NO TIME THESE LAST FOUR HOURS HAD HIS OPPORTUNITY BEEN SO CLOSE OR SO POOR AS PRECISELY NOW HE SAW WILL BANION'S EYES SUDDENLY STARTLED QUICKLY ESTIMATING LOOKING INTO HIS OWN HE KNEW THAT BEHIND HIS OWN EYES
8066-114256-0026 HIS WHOLE FOUL SOUL LAY BARED THE SOUL OF A MURDERER WOODHULL MADE A SWIFT SPRING DOWN THE HILL SCRAMBLING HALF ERECT AND CAUGHT SOME SORT OF STANCE FOR THE WORK WHICH NOW WAS HIS TO DO HE SNARLED
8066-114256-0027 FOR HE SAW BANION STOOP UNARMED IT WOULD DO HIS VICTIM NO GOOD TO RUN THERE WAS TIME EVEN TO EXULT AND THAT WAS MUCH BETTER IN A LONG DEFERRED MATTER SUCH AS THIS NOW DAMN YOU I'VE GOT YOU HE GAVE BANION THAT MUCH CHANCE
8066-114256-0028 HIS FLUNG ARM APPARENTLY HAD GAINED A WEAPON IT WAS NOT MORE THAN THE PIECE OF ROTTEN QUARTZ HE HAD PICKED UP AND PLANNED TO EXAMINE LATER HE FLUNG IT STRAIGHT AT WOODHULL'S FACE AN ACT OF CHANCE OF INSTINCT BY A HAIR IT SAVED HIM
8066-114256-0029 FIRING AND MISSING AT A DISTANCE OF FIFTY FEET WOODHULL REMAINED NOT YET A MURDERER IN DEED IN A FLASH BANION GATHERED AND SPRANG TOWARD HIM AS HE STOOD IN A HALF SECOND OF CONSTERNATION AT SEEING HIS VICTIM FALL AND RISE AGAIN
8066-114256-0030 THE RIFLE CARRIED BUT THE ONE SHOT HE FLUNG IT DOWN REACHED FOR HIS HEAVY KNIFE RAISING AN ARM AGAINST THE SECOND PIECE OF ROCK WHICH BANION FLUNG AS HE CLOSED HE FELT HIS WRIST CAUGHT IN AN IRON GRIP
8066-114256-0031 HIS OWN LONG RIFLE HE SNATCHED FROM ITS PEGS AT A LONG EASY LOPE HE RAN ALONG THE PATH WHICH CARRIED ACROSS THE FACE OF THE RAVINE HIS MOCCASINED FEET MADE NO SOUND HE SAW NO ONE IN THE CREEK BED OR AT THE LONG TURN
8066-114256-0032 BUT NEW THERE CAME A LOUD WORDLESS CRY WHICH HE KNEW WAS MEANT FOR HIM IT WAS WILL BANION'S VOICE THE TWO STRUGGLING MEN GRAPPLED BELOW HIM HAD NO NOTION OF HOW LONG THEY HAD FOUGHT IT SEEMED AN AGE
8066-114256-0033 BUT TO THEM CAME THE SOUND OF A VOICE GIT AWAY WILL STAND BACK IT WAS JACKSON THEY BOTH STILL GRIPPED LOOKED UP THE BANK THE LONG BARREL OF A RIFLE FORESHORTENED TO A BLACK POINT ABOVE IT A COLD EYE FRONTED AND FOLLOWED THEM AS THEY SWAYED
8066-114256-0034 THE CROOKED ARM OF THE RIFLEMAN WAS MOTIONLESS SAVE AS IT JUST MOVED THAT DEADLY CIRCLE AN INCH THIS WAY AN INCH BACK AGAIN BANION KNEW THAT THIS WAS MURDER TOO BUT HE KNEW THAT NAUGHT ON EARTH COULD STAY IT NOW
8066-114256-0035 TO GUARD AS MUCH AS HE COULD AGAINST A LAST DESPERATE KNIFE THRUST EVEN OF A DYING MAN HE BROKE FREE AND SPRANG BACK AS FAR AS HE COULD FALLING PROSTRATE ON HIS BACK AS HE DID SO TRIPPED BY AN UNSEEN STONE BUT SAM WOODHULL WAS NOT UPON HIM NOW
8066-114256-0036 WAS NOT WILLING TO LOSE HIS OWN LIFE IN ORDER TO KILL FOR JUST ONE INSTANT HE LOOKED UP AT THE DEATH STARING DOWN ON HIM THEN TURNED TO RUN THERE WAS NO PLACE WHERE HE COULD RUN THE VOICE OF THE MAN ABOVE HIM CALLED OUT SHARP AND HARD
8066-114256-0037 HALT SAM WOODHULL LOOK AT ME HE DID TURN IN HORROR IN FASCINATION AT SIGHT OF THE BRIGHT ANGEL THE RIFLE BARREL TO HIS LAST GAZE BECAME A SMALL ROUND CIRCLE LARGE AS A BOTTLE TOP
8066-114256-0038 AND AROUND IT SHONE A FRINGED AURA OF RED AND PURPLE LIGHT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE EYE STEADILY AS WHEN HE HAD HELD HIS FRIEND'S LIFE IN HIS HAND SIGHTING FIVE INCHES ABOVE HIS EYES THE OLD HUNTER DREW NOW ABOVE THE EYES OF HIS ENEMY
