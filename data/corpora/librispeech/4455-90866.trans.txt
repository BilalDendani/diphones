4455-90866-0000 FROM THE WAGGON ON PASSING THROUGH IT ROBERT FOUND THAT THEY WERE NOT REALLY WITHIN THE BUILDING BUT MERELY IN A LARGE BARE ANTE CHAMBER
4455-90866-0001 WHICH HAD AROUSED HIS CURIOSITY AND HIS FATHER'S SPECULATIONS ALL MYSTERY HAD GONE FROM THEM NOW HOWEVER FOR WHILE SOME WERE STILL WRAPPED IN THEIR SACKCLOTH COVERINGS OTHERS HAD BEEN UNDONE AND REVEALED THEMSELVES AS GREAT PIGS OF LEAD
4455-90866-0002 I HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE LEAD FOR OF COURSE EVERY IMPURITY IS REPRODUCED IN THE GOLD A HEAVY IRON DOOR LED INTO THE INNER CHAMBER HAW UNLOCKED IT BUT ONLY TO DISCLOSE A SECOND ONE ABOUT FIVE FEET FURTHER ON
4455-90866-0003 I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF GOSSIP IN THE SERVANTS' HALL ABOUT THIS SEALED CHAMBER SO I HAVE TO GUARD MYSELF AGAINST SOME INQUISITIVE OSTLER OR TOO ADVENTUROUS BUTLER
4455-90866-0004 A HIGH BARE WHITEWASHED ROOM WITH A GLASS ROOF AT ONE END WAS THE FURNACE AND BOILER THE IRON MOUTH OF WHICH WAS CLOSED
4455-90866-0005 ON EITHER SIDE INNUMERABLE HUGE LEYDEN JARS STOOD RANGED IN ROWS TIER TOPPING TIER WHILE ABOVE THEM WERE COLUMNS OF VOLTAIC CELLS ROBERT'S EYES AS HE GLANCED AROUND
4455-90866-0006 LIT ON VAST WHEELS COMPLICATED NETWORKS OF WIRE STANDS TEST TUBES COLOURED BOTTLES GRADUATED GLASSES BUNSEN BURNERS PORCELAIN INSULATORS AND ALL THE VARIED DEBRIS
4455-90866-0007 OF A CHEMICAL AND ELECTRICAL WORKSHOP COME ACROSS HERE SAID RAFFLES HAW PICKING HIS WAY AMONG THE HEAPS OF METAL THE COKE THE PACKING CASES AND THE CARBOYS OF ACID YOURS IS THE FIRST FOOT EXCEPT MY OWN
4455-90866-0008 WHICH HAS EVER PENETRATED TO THIS ROOM SINCE THE WORKMEN LEFT IT MY SERVANTS CARRY THE LEAD INTO THE ANTE ROOM BUT COME NO FURTHER THE FURNACE CAN BE CLEANED AND STOKED FROM WITHOUT I EMPLOY A FELLOW TO DO NOTHING ELSE NOW TAKE A LOOK IN HERE
4455-90866-0009 HE THREW OPEN A DOOR ON THE FURTHER SIDE AND MOTIONED TO THE YOUNG ARTIST TO ENTER THE LATTER STOOD SILENT WITH ONE FOOT OVER THE THRESHOLD STARING IN AMAZEMENT AROUND HIM THE ROOM WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN SOME THIRTY FEET SQUARE
4455-90866-0010 THE SINGLE ELECTRIC LAMP WHICH LIGHTED THE WINDOWLESS CHAMBER STRUCK A DULL MURKY YELLOW LIGHT FROM THE VAST PILES OF PRECIOUS METAL AND GLEAMED RUDDILY UPON THE GOLDEN FLOOR THIS IS MY TREASURE HOUSE REMARKED THE OWNER
4455-90866-0011 YOU SEE THAT I HAVE RATHER AN ACCUMULATION JUST NOW MY IMPORTS HAVE BEEN EXCEEDING MY EXPORTS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE OTHER AND MORE IMPORTANT DUTIES EVEN THAN THE MAKING OF GOLD JUST NOW THIS IS WHERE I STORE MY OUTPUT UNTIL I AM READY TO SEND IT OFF
4455-90866-0012 THEY SAY THAT IT IS THE PUREST WHICH COMES INTO THE MARKET THE POPULAR THEORY IS I BELIEVE THAT I AM A MIDDLEMAN ACTING ON BEHALF OF SOME NEW SOUTH AFRICAN MINE WHICH WISHES TO KEEP ITS WHEREABOUTS A SECRET
4455-90866-0013 SOMETHING FABULOUS I HAVE NO DOUBT SAID ROBERT GLANCING ROUND AT THE YELLOW BARRIERS SHALL I SAY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS OH DEAR ME IT IS SURELY WORTH VERY MUCH MORE THAN THAT CRIED RAFFLES HAW LAUGHING LET ME SEE
4455-90866-0014 SUPPOSE THAT WE PUT IT AT THREE TEN AN OUNCE WHICH IS NEARLY TEN SHILLINGS UNDER THE MARK THAT MAKES ROUGHLY FIFTY SIX POUNDS FOR A POUND IN WEIGHT NOW EACH OF THESE INGOTS WEIGHS THIRTY SIX POUNDS WHICH BRINGS THEIR VALUE TO TWO THOUSAND AND A FEW ODD POUNDS
4455-90866-0015 BUT ON THE FOURTH THERE ARE ONLY THREE HUNDRED ON ACCOUNT OF THE DOOR BUT THERE CANNOT BE LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED ON THE FLOOR WHICH GIVES US A ROUGH TOTAL OF TWO THOUSAND INGOTS SO YOU SEE MY DEAR BOY THAT ANY BROKER WHO COULD GET THE CONTENTS OF THIS CHAMBER FOR FOUR MILLION POUNDS
4455-90866-0016 WOULD BE DOING A NICE LITTLE STROKE OF BUSINESS AND A WEEK'S WORK GASPED ROBERT IT MAKES MY HEAD SWIM
4455-90866-0017 AND WERE ATTACHED AT THE OTHER END TO THE ROWS OF DYNAMIC MACHINES BENEATH WAS A GLASS STAND WHICH WAS HOLLOWED OUT IN THE CENTRE INTO A SUCCESSION OF TROUGHS YOU WILL SOON UNDERSTAND ALL ABOUT IT SAID RAFFLES HAW
4455-90866-0018 THROWING OFF HIS COAT AND PULLING ON A SMOKE STAINED AND DIRTY LINEN JACKET WE MUST FIRST STOKE UP A LITTLE HE PUT HIS WEIGHT ON A PAIR OF GREAT BELLOWS AND AN ANSWERING ROAR CAME FROM THE FURNACE THAT WILL DO THE MORE HEAT THE MORE ELECTRIC FORCE AND THE QUICKER OUR TASK
4455-90866-0019 NOW FOR THE LEAD JUST GIVE ME A HAND IN CARRYING IT THEY LIFTED A DOZEN OF THE PIGS OF LEAD FROM THE FLOOR ON TO THE GLASS STAND AND HAVING ADJUSTED THE PLATES ON EITHER SIDE
4455-90866-0020 IT USED IN THE EARLY DAYS TO BE A SLOW PROCESS HE REMARKED BUT NOW THAT I HAVE IMMENSE FACILITIES FOR MY WORK IT TAKES A VERY SHORT TIME I HAVE NOW ONLY TO COMPLETE THE CONNECTION IN ORDER TO BEGIN
4455-90866-0021 HE TOOK HOLD OF A LONG GLASS LEVER WHICH PROJECTED FROM AMONG THE WIRES AND DREW IT DOWNWARDS A SHARP CLICK WAS HEARD FOLLOWED BY A LOUD SPARKLING CRACKLING NOISE GREAT SPURTS OF FLAME SPRANG FROM THE TWO ELECTRODES
4455-90866-0022 WITH HIS WATCH UPON THE PALM OF HIS HAND IT WOULD REDUCE AN ORGANIC SUBSTANCE TO PROTYLE INSTANTLY IT IS WELL TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISM THOROUGHLY FOR ANY MISTAKE
4455-90866-0023 YOU ARE DEALING WITH GIGANTIC FORCES BUT YOU PERCEIVE THAT THE LEAD IS ALREADY BEGINNING TO TURN SILVERY DEW LIKE DROPS HAD INDEED BEGUN TO FORM UPON THE DULL COLOURED MASS
4455-90866-0024 SLOWLY THE LEAD MELTED AWAY LIKE AN ICICLE IN THE SUN THE ELECTRODES EVER CLOSING UPON IT AS IT CONTRACTED UNTIL THEY CAME TOGETHER IN THE CENTRE AND A ROW OF POOLS OF QUICKSILVER HAD TAKEN THE PLACE OF THE SOLID METAL
4455-90866-0025 TWO SMALLER ELECTRODES WERE PLUNGED INTO THE MERCURY WHICH GRADUALLY CURDLED AND SOLIDIFIED UNTIL IT HAD RESUMED THE SOLID FORM WITH A YELLOWISH BRASSY SHIMMER WHAT LIES IN THE MOULDS NOW IS PLATINUM REMARKED RAFFLES HAW
4455-90866-0026 AND THERE LAY A DOZEN BRICKS OF RUDDY SPARKLING GOLD YOU SEE ACCORDING TO OUR CALCULATIONS OUR MORNING'S WORK HAS BEEN WORTH TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS
4455-90866-0027 TO THE WORLD IT WOULD SEEM AN EXPENSIVE DEMONSTRATION WHICH COST TWO THOUSAND POUNDS BUT OUR STANDARD YOU SEE IS A DIFFERENT ONE NOW YOU WILL SEE ME RUN THROUGH THE WHOLE GAMUT OF METALLIC NATURE FIRST OF ALL MEN AFTER THE DISCOVERER
4455-90866-0028 WITH THE STRONTIUM TO PURPLE WITH THE POTASSIUM TO YELLOW WITH THE MANGANESE THEN
4455-90866-0029 AND LAY AS A LITTLE MOUND OF FLUFFY GREY DUST UPON THE GLASS TABLE AND THIS IS PROTYLE SAID HAW PASSING HIS FINGERS THROUGH IT THE CHEMIST OF THE FUTURE MAY RESOLVE IT INTO FURTHER CONSTITUENTS BUT TO ME IT IS THE ULTIMA THULE
4455-90866-0030 THIS SECRET IT IS THE DEAREST WISH OF MY HEART TO USE FOR GOOD
4455-90866-0031 THAT IF I THOUGHT IT WOULD TEND TO ANYTHING BUT GOOD I WOULD HAVE DONE WITH IT FOR EVER NO I WOULD NEITHER USE IT MYSELF NOR WOULD ANY OTHER MAN LEARN IT FROM MY LIPS I SWEAR IT BY ALL THAT IS HOLY AND SOLEMN
4455-90866-0032 STANDING PALE AND LANKY AMID HIS ELECTRODES AND HIS RETORTS THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING MAJESTIC ABOUT THIS MAN WHO AMID ALL HIS STUPENDOUS GOOD FORTUNE COULD STILL KEEP HIS MORAL SENSE UNDAZZLED BY THE GLITTER OF HIS GOLD
4455-90866-0033 ROBERT'S WEAK NATURE HAD NEVER BEFORE REALISED THE STRENGTH WHICH LAY IN THOSE THIN FIRM LIPS AND EARNEST EYES SURELY IN YOUR HANDS MISTER HAW NOTHING BUT GOOD CAN COME OF IT HE SAID I HOPE NOT
4455-90866-0034 I HAVE DONE FOR YOU ROBERT WHAT I MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE FOR MY OWN BROTHER HAD I ONE AND I HAVE DONE IT BECAUSE I BELIEVE AND HOPE THAT YOU ARE A MAN WHO WOULD NOT USE THIS POWER SHOULD YOU INHERIT IT FOR SELFISH ENDS BUT EVEN NOW I HAVE NOT TOLD YOU ALL
4455-90866-0035 THERE IS ONE LINK WHICH I HAVE WITHHELD FROM YOU AND WHICH SHALL BE WITHHELD FROM YOU WHILE I LIVE BUT LOOK AT THIS CHEST ROBERT HE LED HIM TO A GREAT IRON CLAMPED CHEST WHICH STOOD IN THE CORNER AND THROWING IT OPEN HE TOOK FROM IT A SMALL CASE OF CARVED IVORY
4455-90866-0036 INSIDE THIS HE SAID I HAVE LEFT A PAPER WHICH MAKES CLEAR ANYTHING WHICH IS STILL HIDDEN FROM YOU SHOULD ANYTHING HAPPEN TO ME YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO INHERIT MY POWERS AND TO CONTINUE MY PLANS
