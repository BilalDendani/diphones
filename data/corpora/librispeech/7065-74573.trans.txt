7065-74573-0000 THE FIRST BOOK OF OPTICKS
7065-74573-0001 MY DESIGN IN THIS BOOK IS NOT TO EXPLAIN THE PROPERTIES OF LIGHT BY HYPOTHESES BUT TO PROPOSE AND PROVE THEM BY REASON AND EXPERIMENTS
7065-74573-0002 IN ORDER TO WHICH I SHALL PREMISE THE FOLLOWING DEFINITIONS AND AXIOMS DEFINITIONS
7065-74573-0003 I UNDERSTAND ITS LEAST PARTS AND THOSE AS WELL SUCCESSIVE IN THE SAME LINES AS CONTEMPORARY IN SEVERAL LINES FOR IT IS MANIFEST THAT LIGHT CONSISTS OF PARTS BOTH SUCCESSIVE AND CONTEMPORARY
7065-74573-0004 BECAUSE IN THE SAME PLACE YOU MAY STOP THAT WHICH COMES ONE MOMENT AND LET PASS THAT WHICH COMES PRESENTLY AFTER AND IN THE SAME TIME YOU MAY STOP IT IN ANY ONE PLACE
7065-74573-0005 AND LET IT PASS IN ANY OTHER FOR THAT PART OF LIGHT WHICH IS STOPP'D CANNOT BE THE SAME WITH THAT WHICH IS LET PASS THE LEAST LIGHT OR PART OF LIGHT
7065-74573-0006 WHICH MAY BE STOPP'D ALONE WITHOUT THE REST OF THE LIGHT OR PROPAGATED ALONE OR DO OR SUFFER ANY THING ALONE
7065-74573-0007 IS THEIR DISPOSITION TO BE TURNED MORE OR LESS OUT OF THEIR WAY IN LIKE INCIDENCES
7065-74573-0008 MATHEMATICIANS USUALLY CONSIDER THE RAYS OF LIGHT TO BE LINES REACHING FROM THE LUMINOUS BODY TO THE BODY ILLUMINATED AND THE REFRACTION OF THOSE RAYS
7065-74573-0009 TO BE THE BENDING OR BREAKING OF THOSE LINES IN THEIR PASSING OUT OF ONE MEDIUM INTO ANOTHER AND THUS MAY RAYS AND REFRACTIONS BE CONSIDERED IF LIGHT BE PROPAGATED IN AN INSTANT
7065-74573-0010 IT SEEMS THAT LIGHT IS PROPAGATED IN TIME SPENDING IN ITS PASSAGE FROM THE SUN TO US ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES OF TIME AND THEREFORE I HAVE CHOSEN TO DEFINE RAYS AND REFRACTIONS IN SUCH GENERAL TERMS
7065-74573-0011 AS MAY AGREE TO LIGHT IN BOTH CASES
7065-74573-0012 REFLEXIBILITY OF RAYS IS THEIR DISPOSITION TO BE REFLECTED OR TURNED BACK INTO THE SAME MEDIUM FROM ANY OTHER MEDIUM UPON WHOSE SURFACE THEY FALL
7065-74573-0013 AND RAYS ARE MORE OR LESS REFLEXIBLE WHICH ARE TURNED BACK MORE OR LESS EASILY AS IF LIGHT PASS OUT OF A GLASS INTO AIR
7065-74573-0014 BEGINS AT LENGTH TO BE TOTALLY REFLECTED BY THAT SURFACE THOSE SORTS OF RAYS WHICH AT LIKE INCIDENCES ARE REFLECTED MOST COPIOUSLY
7065-74573-0015 OR BY INCLINING THE RAYS BEGIN SOONEST TO BE TOTALLY REFLECTED ARE MOST REFLEXIBLE
7065-74573-0016 HOMOGENEAL AND SIMILAR AND THAT WHOSE RAYS ARE SOME MORE REFRANGIBLE THAN OTHERS I CALL COMPOUND HETEROGENEAL AND DISSIMILAR THE FORMER LIGHT I CALL HOMOGENEAL
