4290-14526-0000 THAT INCAPACITY IN NATIONAL POLITICS SHOULD APPEAR AS A LEADING TRAIT IN AMERICAN CHARACTER WAS UNEXPECTED BY AMERICANS BUT MIGHT NATURALLY RESULT FROM THEIR CONDITIONS THE BETTER TEST OF AMERICAN CHARACTER WAS NOT POLITICAL BUT SOCIAL
4290-14526-0001 AND WAS TO BE FOUND NOT IN THE GOVERNMENT BUT IN THE PEOPLE THE SIXTEEN YEARS OF JEFFERSON AND MADISON'S RULE FURNISHED INTERNATIONAL TESTS OF POPULAR INTELLIGENCE UPON WHICH AMERICANS COULD DEPEND
4290-14526-0002 THE OCEAN WAS THE ONLY OPEN FIELD FOR COMPETITION AMONG NATIONS AMERICANS ENJOYED THERE NO NATURAL OR ARTIFICIAL ADVANTAGES OVER ENGLISHMEN FRENCHMEN OR SPANIARDS
4290-14526-0003 YET THE AMERICANS DEVELOPED IN THE COURSE OF TWENTY YEARS A SURPRISING DEGREE OF SKILL IN NAVAL AFFAIRS
4290-14526-0004 WAS THE MORE REMARKABLE BECAUSE
4290-14526-0005 THIS ALONE SPRANG FROM DIRECT COMPETITION WITH EUROPE DURING TEN CENTURIES OF STRUGGLE THE NATIONS OF EUROPE HAD LABORED TO OBTAIN SUPERIORITY OVER EACH OTHER IN SHIP CONSTRUCTION YET AMERICANS INSTANTLY MADE IMPROVEMENTS WHICH GAVE THEM SUPERIORITY
4290-14526-0006 AND WHICH EUROPEANS WERE UNABLE IMMEDIATELY TO IMITATE EVEN AFTER SEEING THEM NOT ONLY WERE AMERICAN VESSELS BETTER IN MODEL FASTER IN SAILING EASIER AND QUICKER IN HANDLING AND MORE ECONOMICAL IN WORKING THAN THE EUROPEAN
4290-14526-0007 BUT THEY WERE ALSO BETTER EQUIPPED THE ENGLISH COMPLAINED AS A GRIEVANCE THAT THE AMERICANS ADOPTED NEW AND UNWARRANTED DEVICES IN NAVAL WARFARE THAT THEIR VESSELS WERE HEAVIER AND BETTER CONSTRUCTED AND THEIR MISSILES OF UNUSUAL SHAPE AND IMPROPER USE
4290-14526-0008 THE AMERICANS RESORTED TO EXPEDIENTS THAT HAD NOT BEEN TRIED BEFORE
4290-14526-0009 THE ENGLISH ADMITTED THEMSELVES TO BE SLOW TO CHANGE THEIR HABITS BUT THE FRENCH WERE BOTH QUICK AND SCIENTIFIC YET AMERICANS DID ON THE OCEAN WHAT THE FRENCH UNDER STRONGER INDUCEMENTS FAILED TO DO
4290-14526-0010 THE FRENCH PRIVATEER PREYED UPON BRITISH COMMERCE FOR TWENTY YEARS WITHOUT SERIOUSLY INJURING IT
4290-14526-0011 AND AN OUTCRY FOR PROTECTION AROSE AMONG ENGLISH SHIPPERS WHICH THE ADMIRALTY COULD NOT CALM THE BRITISH NEWSPAPERS WERE FILLED WITH ASSERTIONS THAT THE AMERICAN CRUISER WAS THE SUPERIOR OF ANY VESSEL OF ITS CLASS
4290-14526-0012 AND THREATENED TO OVERTHROW ENGLAND'S SUPREMACY ON THE OCEAN ANOTHER TEST OF RELATIVE INTELLIGENCE WAS FURNISHED BY THE BATTLES AT SEA
4290-14526-0013 THEY EXPLAINED THEIR INFERIORITY BY THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT HAD ELAPSED SINCE THEIR NAVY HAD FOUND ON THE OCEAN AN ENEMY TO FIGHT EVERY VESTIGE OF HOSTILE FLEETS HAD BEEN SWEPT AWAY UNTIL AFTER THE BATTLE OF TRAFALGAR
4290-14526-0014 BRITISH FRIGATES CEASED PRACTICE WITH THEIR GUNS DOUBTLESS THE BRITISH NAVY HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT CARELESS IN THE ABSENCE OF A DANGEROUS ENEMY
4290-14526-0015 NOTHING SHOWED THAT NELSON'S LINE OF BATTLE SHIPS FRIGATES OR SLOOPS WERE AS A RULE BETTER FOUGHT THAN THE MACEDONIAN AND JAVA THE AVON AND REINDEER
4290-14526-0016 OF ALL VESSELS THE SLOOP OF WAR ON ACCOUNT OF ITS SMALLNESS ITS QUICK MOTION AND ITS MORE ACCURATE ARMAMENT OF THIRTY TWO POUND CARRONADES OFFERED THE BEST TEST OF RELATIVE GUNNERY
4290-14526-0017 AND SIR HOWARD DOUGLAS IN COMMENTING UPON THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PEACOCK AND AVON
4290-14526-0018 IN THESE TWO ACTIONS IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FIRE OF THE BRITISH VESSELS WAS THROWN TOO HIGH AND THAT THE ORDNANCE OF THEIR OPPONENTS WERE EXPRESSLY AND CAREFULLY AIMED AT AND TOOK EFFECT CHIEFLY IN THE HULL
4290-14526-0019 SHOWED THAT THE EXCELLENCE OF AMERICAN GUNNERY CONTINUED TILL THE CLOSE OF THE WAR WHETHER AT POINT BLANK RANGE OR AT LONG DISTANCE PRACTICE THE AMERICANS USED GUNS AS THEY HAD NEVER BEEN USED AT SEA BEFORE
4290-14526-0020 NONE OF THE REPORTS OF FORMER BRITISH VICTORIES SHOWED THAT THE BRITISH FIRE HAD BEEN MORE DESTRUCTIVE AT ANY PREVIOUS TIME THAN IN EIGHTEEN TWELVE
4290-14526-0021 AND NO REPORT OF ANY COMMANDER SINCE THE BRITISH NAVY EXISTED SHOWED SO MUCH DAMAGE INFLICTED ON AN OPPONENT IN SO SHORT A TIME AS WAS PROVED TO HAVE BEEN INFLICTED ON THEMSELVES BY THE REPORTS OF BRITISH COMMANDERS IN THE AMERICAN WAR
4290-14526-0022 THE STRONGEST PROOF OF AMERICAN SUPERIORITY WAS GIVEN BY THE BEST BRITISH OFFICERS LIKE BROKE WHO STRAINED EVERY NERVE TO MAINTAIN AN EQUALITY WITH AMERICAN GUNNERY
4290-14526-0023 SO INSTANTANEOUS AND ENERGETIC WAS THE EFFORT THAT ACCORDING TO THE BRITISH HISTORIAN OF THE WAR
4290-14526-0024 OF THE CAPTURED BRITISH SHIPS PROVED THAT NO WANT OF THEIR OLD FIGHTING QUALITIES ACCOUNTED FOR THEIR REPEATED AND ALMOST HABITUAL MORTIFICATIONS UNWILLING AS THE ENGLISH WERE TO ADMIT THE SUPERIOR SKILL OF AMERICANS ON THE OCEAN
4290-14526-0025 THEY DID NOT HESITATE TO ADMIT IT IN CERTAIN RESPECTS ON LAND THE AMERICAN RIFLE IN AMERICAN HANDS WAS AFFIRMED TO HAVE NO EQUAL IN THE WORLD THIS ADMISSION COULD SCARCELY BE WITHHELD AFTER THE LISTS OF KILLED AND WOUNDED WHICH FOLLOWED ALMOST EVERY BATTLE
4290-14526-0026 BUT THE ADMISSION SERVED TO CHECK A WIDER INQUIRY IN TRUTH THE RIFLE PLAYED BUT A SMALL PART IN THE WAR WINCHESTER'S MEN AT THE RIVER RAISIN MAY HAVE OWED THEIR OVER CONFIDENCE AS THE BRITISH FORTY FIRST OWED ITS LOSSES TO THAT WEAPON
4290-14526-0027 AND AT NEW ORLEANS FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED OF COFFEE'S MEN WHO WERE OUT OF RANGE WERE ARMED WITH THE RIFLE BUT THE SURPRISING LOSSES OF THE BRITISH WERE COMMONLY DUE TO ARTILLERY AND MUSKETRY FIRE AT NEW ORLEANS THE ARTILLERY WAS CHIEFLY ENGAGED
4290-14526-0028 THE ARTILLERY BATTLE OF JANUARY FIRST ACCORDING TO BRITISH ACCOUNTS AMPLY PROVED THE SUPERIORITY OF AMERICAN GUNNERY ON THAT OCCASION WHICH WAS PROBABLY THE FAIREST TEST DURING THE WAR THE BATTLE OF JANUARY EIGHTH WAS ALSO CHIEFLY AN ARTILLERY BATTLE
4290-14526-0029 THE MAIN BRITISH COLUMN NEVER ARRIVED WITHIN FAIR MUSKET RANGE PAKENHAM WAS KILLED BY A GRAPE SHOT AND THE MAIN COLUMN OF HIS TROOPS HALTED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE PARAPET
4290-14526-0030 TWO PARALLEL LINES OF REGULAR SOLDIERS PRACTICALLY EQUAL IN NUMBERS ARMED WITH SIMILAR WEAPONS MOVED IN CLOSE ORDER TOWARD EACH OTHER ACROSS A WIDE OPEN PLAIN WITHOUT COVER OR ADVANTAGE OF POSITION STOPPING AT INTERVALS TO LOAD AND FIRE
4290-14526-0031 UNTIL ONE LINE BROKE AND RETIRED AT THE SAME TIME TWO THREE GUN BATTERIES THE BRITISH BEING THE HEAVIER MAINTAINED A STEADY FIRE FROM POSITIONS OPPOSITE EACH OTHER ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS THE TWO INFANTRY LINES IN THE CENTRE NEVER CAME NEARER THAN EIGHTY YARDS
4290-14526-0032 OWING TO SEVERE LOSSES HIS TROOPS BROKE AND COULD NOT BE RALLIED COMPARISON OF OFFICIAL REPORTS SHOWED THAT THE BRITISH LOST IN KILLED AND WOUNDED FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE MEN
4290-14526-0033 THE AMERICANS TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX SOME DOUBTS ALWAYS AFFECT THE RETURNS OF WOUNDED BECAUSE THE SEVERITY OF THE WOUND CANNOT BE KNOWN BUT DEAD MEN TELL THEIR OWN TALE
4290-14526-0034 AND THE RETURNS PROVED THAT THE AMERICAN FIRE WAS SUPERIOR TO THAT OF THE BRITISH IN THE PROPORTION OF MORE THAN FIFTY PER CENT IF ESTIMATED BY THE ENTIRE LOSS AND OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO TO ONE HUNDRED IF ESTIMATED BY THE DEATHS ALONE
4290-14526-0035 BESIDES THE MORTIFICATION OF DEFEAT CAPTAIN ELEAZER DERBY WOOD OF NEW YORK CONSTRUCTED FORT MEIGS WHICH ENABLED HARRISON TO DEFEAT THE ATTACK OF PROCTOR IN MAY EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN CAPTAIN JOSEPH GILBERT TOTTEN OF NEW YORK
4290-14526-0036 WAS CHIEF ENGINEER TO GENERAL IZARD AT PLATTSBURG WHERE HE DIRECTED THE FORTIFICATIONS THAT STOPPED THE ADVANCE OF PREVOST'S GREAT ARMY NONE OF THE WORKS CONSTRUCTED BY A GRADUATE OF WEST POINT WAS CAPTURED BY THE ENEMY
4290-14526-0037 AND HAD AN ENGINEER BEEN EMPLOYED AT WASHINGTON BY ARMSTRONG AND WINDER THE CITY WOULD HAVE BEEN EASILY SAVED PERHAPS WITHOUT EXAGGERATION THE WEST POINT ACADEMY MIGHT BE SAID TO HAVE DECIDED NEXT TO THE NAVY THE RESULT OF THE WAR
4290-14526-0038 THE WORKS AT NEW ORLEANS WERE SIMPLE IN CHARACTER AND AS FAR AS THEY WERE DUE TO ENGINEERING SKILL WERE DIRECTED BY MAJOR LATOUR A FRENCHMAN BUT THE WAR WAS ALREADY ENDED WHEN THE BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS WAS FOUGHT DURING THE CRITICAL CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN
4290-14526-0039 THE WEST POINT ENGINEERS DOUBLED THE CAPACITY OF THE LITTLE AMERICAN ARMY FOR RESISTANCE
4290-14526-0040 SAILED INTO THE MIDST OF BROKE'S FIVE SHIPS CAPTAIN ISAAC HULL IN COMMAND OF THE CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN DETAINED AT ANNAPOLIS SHIPPING A NEW CREW UNTIL JULY FIFTH THE DAY WHEN BROKE'S SQUADRON LEFT HALIFAX
4290-14526-0041 THEN THE SHIP GOT UNDER WAY AND STOOD DOWN CHESAPEAKE BAY ON HER VOYAGE TO NEW YORK THE WIND WAS AHEAD AND VERY LIGHT NOT UNTIL JULY TENTH DID THE SHIP ANCHOR OFF CAPE HENRY LIGHTHOUSE
4290-14526-0042 AND NOT TILL SUNRISE OF JULY TWELFTH DID SHE STAND TO THE EASTWARD AND NORTHWARD
4290-14526-0043 WHEN AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON OFF BARNEGAT ON THE NEW JERSEY COAST THE LOOKOUT AT THE MASTHEAD DISCOVERED FOUR SAILS TO THE NORTHWARD AND TWO HOURS LATER A FIFTH SAIL TO THE NORTHEAST HULL TOOK THEM FOR RODGERS'S SQUADRON THE WIND WAS LIGHT
4290-14526-0044 AND HULL BEING TO WINDWARD DETERMINED TO SPEAK THE NEAREST VESSEL THE LAST TO COME IN SIGHT THE AFTERNOON PASSED WITHOUT BRINGING THE SHIPS TOGETHER
4290-14526-0045 HULL DECIDED TO LOSE NO TIME IN ESCAPING THEN FOLLOWED ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING AND SUSTAINED CHASES RECORDED IN NAVAL HISTORY AT DAYBREAK THE NEXT MORNING ONE BRITISH FRIGATE WAS ASTERN WITHIN FIVE OR SIX MILES TWO MORE WERE TO LEEWARD
4290-14526-0046 AND THE REST OF THE FLEET SOME TEN MILES ASTERN ALL MAKING CHASE HULL PUT OUT HIS BOATS TO TOW THE CONSTITUTION BROKE SUMMONED THE BOATS OF THE SQUADRON TO TOW THE SHANNON HULL THEN BENT ALL HIS SPARE ROPE TO THE CABLES DROPPED A SMALL ANCHOR HALF A MILE AHEAD
4290-14526-0047 IN TWENTY SIX FATHOMS OF WATER AND WARPED HIS SHIP ALONG BROKE QUICKLY IMITATED THE DEVICE AND SLOWLY GAINED ON THE CHASE THE GUERRIERE CREPT SO NEAR HULL'S LEE BEAM AS TO OPEN FIRE BUT HER SHOT FELL SHORT
4290-14526-0048 FORTUNATELY THE WIND THOUGH SLIGHT FAVORED HULL ALL NIGHT THE BRITISH AND AMERICAN CREWS TOILED ON AND WHEN MORNING CAME THE BELVIDERA PROVING TO BE THE BEST SAILER GOT IN ADVANCE OF HER CONSORTS
4290-14526-0049 WORKING TWO KEDGE ANCHORS UNTIL AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON SHE TRIED IN HER TURN TO REACH THE CONSTITUTION WITH HER BOW GUNS BUT IN VAIN HULL EXPECTED CAPTURE
4290-14526-0050 BUT THE BELVIDERA COULD NOT APPROACH NEARER WITHOUT BRINGING HER BOATS UNDER THE CONSTITUTION'S STERN GUNS AND THE WEARIED CREWS TOILED ON TOWING AND KEDGING THE SHIPS BARELY OUT OF GUNSHOT TILL ANOTHER MORNING CAME
4290-14526-0051 THE BREEZE THOUGH STILL LIGHT THEN ALLOWED HULL TO TAKE IN HIS BOATS THE BELVIDERA BEING TWO AND A HALF MILES IN HIS WAKE THE SHANNON THREE AND A HALF MILES ON HIS LEE AND THE THREE OTHER FRIGATES WELL TO LEEWARD THE WIND FRESHENED AND THE CONSTITUTION DREW AHEAD
4290-14526-0052 UNTIL TOWARD SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING OF JULY NINETEENTH A HEAVY RAIN SQUALL STRUCK THE SHIP AND BY TAKING SKILLFUL ADVANTAGE OF IT HULL LEFT THE BELVIDERA AND SHANNON FAR ASTERN YET UNTIL EIGHT O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING THEY WERE STILL IN SIGHT
4290-14526-0053 KEEPING UP THE CHASE PERHAPS NOTHING DURING THE WAR TESTED AMERICAN SEAMANSHIP MORE THOROUGHLY THAN THESE THREE DAYS OF COMBINED SKILL AND ENDURANCE IN THE FACE OF THE IRRESISTIBLE ENEMY
4290-14526-0054 THE RESULT SHOWED THAT HULL AND THE CONSTITUTION HAD NOTHING TO FEAR IN THESE RESPECTS THERE REMAINED THE QUESTION WHETHER THE SUPERIORITY EXTENDED TO HIS GUNS AND SUCH WAS THE CONTEMPT OF THE BRITISH NAVAL OFFICERS FOR AMERICAN SHIPS
4290-14526-0055 THAT WITH THIS EXPEDIENCE BEFORE THEIR EYES THEY STILL BELIEVED ONE OF THEIR THIRTY EIGHT GUN FRIGATES TO BE MORE THAN A MATCH FOR AN AMERICAN FORTY FOUR ALTHOUGH THE AMERICAN BESIDES THE HEAVIER ARMAMENT
4290-14526-0056 HAD PROVED HIS CAPACITY TO OUTSAIL AND OUT MANOEUVRE THE ENGLISHMAN BOTH PARTIES BECAME MORE EAGER THAN EVER FOR THE TEST FOR ONCE EVEN THE FEDERALISTS OF NEW ENGLAND FELT THEIR BLOOD STIR
4290-14526-0057 FOR THEIR OWN PRESIDENT AND THEIR OWN VOTES HAD CALLED THESE FRIGATES INTO EXISTENCE AND A VICTORY WON BY THE CONSTITUTION WHICH HAD BEEN BUILT BY THEIR HANDS WAS IN THEIR EYES A GREATER VICTORY OVER THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENTS THAN OVER THE BRITISH
4290-14526-0058 FITTING OUT AT THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD BUT SECRETARY HAMILTON JULY TWENTY EIGHTH ORDERED HIM TO TAKE COMMAND ALSO OF THE CONSTITUTION ON HER ARRIVAL IN PORT DOUBTLESS HULL EXPECTED THIS CHANGE
4290-14526-0059 AND PROBABLY THE EXPECTATION INDUCED HIM TO RISK A DANGEROUS EXPERIMENT FOR WITHOUT BRINGING HIS SHIP TO THE CHARLESTOWN NAVY YARD
4290-14526-0060 AFTER OBTAINING SUCH SUPPLIES AS HE NEEDED
4290-14526-0061 THE CONSTITUTION THE NEXT DAY AUGUST NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN TWELVE AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
4290-14526-0062 SIGHTED THE GUERRIERE THE MEETING WAS WELCOME ON BOTH SIDES ONLY THREE DAYS BEFORE CAPTAIN DACRES HAD ENTERED ON THE LOG OF A MERCHANTMAN A CHALLENGE TO ANY AMERICAN FRIGATE TO MEET HIM OFF SANDY HOOK
4290-14526-0063 BUT THE MISTAKE WHICH CAUSED THE LITTLE BELT TO SUFFER SO SERIOUSLY FOR THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING TAKEN FOR THE GUERRIERE HAD CAUSED A CORRESPONDING FEELING OF ANGER IN THE OFFICERS OF THE BRITISH FRIGATE
4290-14526-0064 THE MEETING OF AUGUST NINETEENTH HAD THE CHARACTER OF A PRECONCERTED DUEL THE WIND WAS BLOWING FRESH FROM THE NORTHWEST WITH THE SEA RUNNING HIGH DACRES BACKED HIS MAIN TOPSAIL AND WAITED HULL SHORTENED SAIL AND RAN DOWN BEFORE THE WIND
4290-14526-0065 THEY POUNDED EACH OTHER WITH ALL THEIR STRENGTH AS RAPIDLY AS THE GUNS COULD BE WORKED THE CONSTITUTION POURED IN BROADSIDE AFTER BROADSIDE DOUBLE SHOTTED WITH ROUND AND GRAPE AND WITHOUT EXAGGERATION THE ECHO OF THESE GUNS STARTLED THE WORLD
4290-14526-0066 IN LESS THAN THIRTY MINUTES FROM THE TIME WE GOT ALONGSIDE OF THE ENEMY REPORTED HULL
4290-14526-0067 THE LENGTH OF THE CONSTITUTION WAS ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE FEET
4290-14526-0068 DACRES KNEW THIS VERY NEARLY AS WELL AS IT WAS KNOWN TO HULL YET HE SOUGHT A DUEL WHAT HE DID NOT KNOW WAS THAT IN A STILL GREATER PROPORTION THE AMERICAN OFFICERS AND CREW WERE BETTER AND MORE INTELLIGENT SEAMEN THAN THE BRITISH
4290-14526-0069 AND THAT THEIR PASSIONATE WISH TO REPAY OLD SCORES GAVE THEM EXTRAORDINARY ENERGY SO MUCH GREATER WAS THE MORAL SUPERIORITY THAN THE PHYSICAL THAT WHILE THE GUERRIERE'S FORCE COUNTED AS SEVEN AGAINST TEN
4290-14526-0070 HER LOSSES COUNTED AS THOUGH HER FORCE WERE ONLY TWO AGAINST TEN DACRES'S ERROR COST HIM DEAR FOR AMONG THE GUERRIERE'S CREW OF TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO SEVENTY NINE WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED
4290-14526-0071 AND THE SHIP WAS INJURED BEYOND SAVING BEFORE DACRES REALIZED HIS MISTAKE ALTHOUGH HE NEEDED ONLY THIRTY MINUTES OF CLOSE FIGHTING FOR THE PURPOSE HE NEVER FULLY UNDERSTOOD THE CAUSES OF HIS DEFEAT
