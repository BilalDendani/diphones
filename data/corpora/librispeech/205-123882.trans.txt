205-123882-0000 IT LEAVES THE CITY EVERY DAY ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THE TRAIN FOR MARIPOSA STRANGE THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW OF IT THOUGH YOU COME FROM THE LITTLE TOWN OR DID LONG YEARS AGO ODD THAT YOU NEVER KNEW IN ALL THESE YEARS
205-123882-0001 THAT THE TRAIN WAS THERE EVERY AFTERNOON PUFFING UP STEAM IN THE CITY STATION AND THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BOARDED IT ANY DAY AND GONE HOME NO NOT HOME OF COURSE YOU COULDN'T CALL IT HOME NOW
205-123882-0002 HOME MEANS THAT BIG RED SANDSTONE HOUSE OF YOURS IN THE COSTLIER PART OF THE CITY HOME MEANS IN A WAY THIS MAUSOLEUM CLUB WHERE YOU SOMETIMES TALK WITH ME
205-123882-0003 BUT OF COURSE HOME WOULD HARDLY BE THE WORD YOU WOULD APPLY TO THE LITTLE TOWN UNLESS PERHAPS LATE AT NIGHT WHEN YOU'D BEEN SITTING READING IN A QUIET CORNER SOMEWHERE SUCH A BOOK AS THE PRESENT ONE NATURALLY YOU DON'T KNOW OF THE MARIPOSA TRAIN NOW
205-123882-0004 YOU USED TO WANDER DOWN TO THE STATION ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON AFTER YOUR WORK AND WATCH THE MARIPOSA PEOPLE GETTING ON THE TRAIN AND WISH THAT YOU COULD GO WHY YOU KNEW THAT TRAIN AT ONE TIME BETTER I SUPPOSE THAN ANY OTHER SINGLE THING IN THE CITY
205-123882-0005 AND LOVED IT TOO FOR THE LITTLE TOWN IN THE SUNSHINE THAT IT RAN TO
205-123882-0006 YOU'D GO BACK HOME AGAIN TO THE LITTLE TOWN AND BUILD A GREAT BIG HOUSE WITH A FINE VERANDAH NO STINT ABOUT IT THE BEST THAT MONEY COULD BUY PLANED LUMBER EVERY SQUARE FOOT OF IT AND A FINE PICKET FENCE IN FRONT OF IT
205-123882-0007 IT WAS TO BE ONE OF THE GRANDEST AND FINEST HOUSES THAT THOUGHT COULD CONCEIVE MUCH FINER IN TRUE REALITY THAN THAT VAST PALACE OF SANDSTONE WITH THE PORTE COCHERE AND THE SWEEPING CONSERVATORIES THAT YOU AFTERWARDS BUILT IN THE COSTLIER PART OF THE CITY
205-123882-0008 BUT IF YOU HAVE HALF FORGOTTEN MARIPOSA AND LONG SINCE LOST THE WAY TO IT YOU ARE ONLY LIKE THE GREATER PART OF THE MEN HERE IN THIS MAUSOLEUM CLUB IN THE CITY WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT THAT PRACTICALLY EVERY ONE OF THEM CAME FROM MARIPOSA ONCE UPON A TIME
205-123882-0009 AND THAT THERE ISN'T ONE OF THEM THAT DOESN'T SOMETIMES DREAM IN THE DULL QUIET OF THE LONG EVENING HERE IN THE CLUB THAT SOME DAY HE WILL GO BACK AND SEE THE PLACE THEY ALL DO ONLY THEY'RE HALF ASHAMED TO OWN IT
205-123882-0010 ASK YOUR NEIGHBOUR THERE AT THE NEXT TABLE WHETHER THE PARTRIDGE THAT THEY SOMETIMES SERVE TO YOU HERE CAN BE COMPARED FOR A MOMENT TO THE BIRDS THAT HE AND YOU OR HE AND SOME ONE ELSE USED TO SHOOT AS BOYS IN THE SPRUCE THICKETS ALONG THE LAKE
205-123882-0011 ASK HIM IF HE EVER TASTED DUCK THAT COULD FOR A MOMENT BE COMPARED TO THE BLACK DUCKS IN THE RICE MARSH ALONG THE OSSAWIPPI AND AS FOR FISH AND FISHING
205-123882-0012 BUT NO WONDER THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE FIVE O'CLOCK TRAIN FOR MARIPOSA VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IT HUNDREDS OF THEM KNOW THAT THERE IS A TRAIN THAT GOES OUT AT FIVE O'CLOCK BUT THEY MISTAKE IT EVER SO MANY OF THEM THINK IT'S JUST A SUBURBAN TRAIN
205-123882-0013 LOTS OF PEOPLE THAT TAKE IT EVERY DAY THINK IT'S ONLY THE TRAIN TO THE GOLF GROUNDS BUT THE JOKE IS THAT AFTER IT PASSES OUT OF THE CITY AND THE SUBURBS AND THE GOLF GROUNDS IT TURNS ITSELF LITTLE BY LITTLE INTO THE MARIPOSA TRAIN
205-123882-0014 THUNDERING AND POUNDING TOWARDS THE NORTH WITH HEMLOCK SPARKS POURING OUT INTO THE DARKNESS FROM THE FUNNEL OF IT OF COURSE YOU CAN'T TELL IT JUST AT FIRST ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE CROWDING INTO IT WITH GOLF CLUBS AND WEARING KNICKERBOCKERS AND FLAT CAPS WOULD DECEIVE ANYBODY
205-123882-0015 THAT CROWD OF SUBURBAN PEOPLE GOING HOME ON COMMUTATION TICKETS AND SOMETIMES STANDING THICK IN THE AISLES THOSE ARE OF COURSE NOT MARIPOSA PEOPLE BUT LOOK ROUND A LITTLE BIT AND YOU'LL FIND THEM EASILY ENOUGH
205-123882-0016 HERE AND THERE IN THE CROWD THOSE PEOPLE WITH THE CLOTHES THAT ARE PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT AND YET LOOK ODD IN SOME WAY THE WOMEN WITH THE PECULIAR HATS
205-123882-0017 MARIPOSA PEOPLE OH YES THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF THEM ON THE TRAIN EVERY DAY BUT OF COURSE YOU HARDLY RECOGNIZE THEM WHILE THE TRAIN IS STILL PASSING THROUGH THE SUBURBS
205-123882-0018 BUT WAIT A LITTLE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT WHEN THE CITY IS WELL BEHIND YOU BIT BY BIT THE TRAIN CHANGES ITS CHARACTER THE ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE THAT TOOK YOU THROUGH THE CITY TUNNELS IS OFF NOW
205-123882-0019 I SUPPOSE VERY PROBABLY YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ONE OF THESE WOOD ENGINES SINCE YOU WERE A BOY FORTY YEARS AGO THE OLD ENGINE WITH A WIDE TOP LIKE A HAT ON ITS FUNNEL AND WITH SPARKS ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP A SUIT FOR DAMAGES ONCE IN EVERY MILE
205-123882-0020 DO YOU SEE TOO THAT THE TRIM LITTLE CARS THAT CAME OUT OF THE CITY ON THE ELECTRIC SUBURBAN EXPRESS ARE BEING DISCARDED NOW AT THE WAY STATIONS ONE BY ONE AND IN THEIR PLACE IS THE OLD FAMILIAR CAR WITH THE STUFF CUSHIONS IN RED PLUSH
205-123882-0021 HOW GORGEOUS IT ONCE SEEMED AND WITH A BOX STOVE SET UP IN ONE END OF IT THE STOVE IS BURNING FURIOUSLY AT ITS STICKS THIS AUTUMN EVENING FOR THE AIR SETS IN CHILL AS YOU GET CLEAR AWAY FROM THE CITY
205-123882-0022 AND ARE RISING UP TO THE HIGHER GROUND OF THE COUNTRY OF THE PINES AND THE LAKES LOOK FROM THE WINDOW AS YOU GO THE CITY IS FAR BEHIND NOW
205-123882-0023 YOU WOULD TAKE THE TRAIN AND GO BACK TO THE LITTLE TOWN TO SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE NOW AND IF THINGS HAD CHANGED MUCH SINCE YOUR DAY BUT EACH TIME WHEN YOUR HOLIDAYS CAME SOMEHOW YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND AND WENT DOWN TO
205-123882-0024 THEY HAVE LENGTHENED OUT THE TRAIN BY THIS TIME WITH A STRING OF FLAT CARS AND FREIGHT CARS BETWEEN WHERE WE ARE SITTING AND THE ENGINE BUT AT EVERY CROSSWAY
205-123882-0025 THE WOODS I SAY FOR THE FARMS ARE THINNING OUT AND THE TRACK PLUNGES HERE AND THERE INTO GREAT STRETCHES OF BUSH TALL TAMERACK AND RED SCRUB WILLOW
205-123882-0026 AND WITH A TANGLED UNDERGROWTH OF BUSH THAT HAS DEFIED FOR TWO GENERATIONS ALL ATTEMPTS TO CLEAR IT INTO THE FORM OF FIELDS WHY LOOK THAT GREAT SPACE THAT SEEMS TO OPEN OUT
205-123882-0027 WHY SURELY YES LAKE OSSAWIPPI THE BIG LAKE AS THEY USED TO CALL IT FROM WHICH THE RIVER RUNS DOWN TO THE SMALLER LAKE LAKE WISSANOTTI WHERE THE TOWN OF MARIPOSA HAS LAIN WAITING FOR YOU THERE FOR THIRTY YEARS
205-123882-0028 THIS IS LAKE OSSAWIPPI SURELY ENOUGH YOU WOULD KNOW IT ANYWHERE BY THE BROAD STILL BLACK WATER WITH HARDLY A RIPPLE AND WITH THE GRIP OF THE COMING FROST ALREADY ON IT SUCH A GREAT SHEET OF BLACKNESS IT LOOKS AS THE TRAIN THUNDERS ALONG THE SIDE
205-123882-0029 SWINGING THE CURVE OF THE EMBANKMENT AT A BREAKNECK SPEED AS IT ROUNDS THE CORNER OF THE LAKE HOW FAST THE TRAIN GOES THIS AUTUMN NIGHT YOU HAVE TRAVELLED I KNOW YOU HAVE IN THE EMPIRE STATE EXPRESS
205-123882-0030 AND THE NEW LIMITED AND THE MARITIME EXPRESS THAT HOLDS THE RECORD OF SIX HUNDRED WHIRLING MILES FROM PARIS TO MARSEILLES BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO THIS THIS MAD CAREER THIS BREAKNECK SPEED THIS THUNDERING ROAR OF THE MARIPOSA LOCAL DRIVING HARD TO ITS HOME
205-123882-0031 DON'T TELL ME THAT THE SPEED IS ONLY TWENTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS
205-123882-0032 THAT THAT TRAIN OF MINGLED FLAT CARS AND COACHES THAT GOES TEARING INTO THE NIGHT
205-123882-0033 YES AND THE BEST TOO THE MOST COMFORTABLE THE MOST RELIABLE THE MOST LUXURIOUS AND THE SPEEDIEST TRAIN THAT EVER TURNED A WHEEL AND THE MOST GENIAL
205-123882-0034 THAT DULL RESERVE THAT SEEMED TO HOLD THE PASSENGERS IN THE ELECTRIC SUBURBAN HAS CLEAN VANISHED AND GONE THEY ARE TALKING LISTEN OF THE HARVEST AND THE LATE ELECTION AND OF HOW THE LOCAL MEMBER IS MENTIONED FOR THE CABINET AND ALL THE OLD FAMILIAR TOPICS OF THE SORT
205-123882-0035 ALREADY THE CONDUCTOR HAS CHANGED HIS GLAZED HAT FOR AN ORDINARY ROUND CHRISTIE
205-123882-0036 BILL AND SAM AS IF THEY WERE ALL ONE FAMILY WHAT IS IT NOW NINE THIRTY AH THEN WE MUST BE NEARING THE TOWN THIS BIG BUSH THAT WE ARE PASSING THROUGH YOU REMEMBER IT SURELY AS THE GREAT SWAMP JUST THIS SIDE OF THE BRIDGE OVER THE OSSAWIPPI
205-123882-0037 THERE IS THE BRIDGE ITSELF AND THE LONG ROAR OF THE TRAIN AS IT RUSHES SOUNDING OVER THE TRESTLE WORK THAT RISES ABOVE THE MARSH HEAR THE CLATTER AS WE PASS THE SEMAPHORES AND SWITCH LIGHTS WE MUST BE CLOSE IN NOW
205-123882-0038 NO DON'T BOTHER TO LOOK AT THE REFLECTION OF YOUR FACE IN THE WINDOW PANE SHADOWED BY THE NIGHT OUTSIDE NOBODY COULD TELL YOU NOW AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
205-123882-0039 PERHAPS IF YOU HAD COME BACK NOW AND AGAIN JUST AT ODD TIMES IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO THERE YOU HEAR IT
205-123882-0040 ONE TWO THREE
