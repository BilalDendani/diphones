4071-39616-0000 HE WAS A YOUNG MAN OF FROM TWENTY FOUR TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE TALL AND SLENDER WEARING GRACEFULLY THE PICTURESQUE MILITARY COSTUME OF THE PERIOD HIS LARGE BOOTS CONTAINED A FOOT WHICH MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS MIGHT NOT HAVE DISOWNED IF SHE HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO A MAN
4071-39616-0001 THEN STOOPING TOWARDS HIM IN A CLEAR DISTINCT VOICE WHICH WAS PERFECTLY AUDIBLE AT THE WINDOW WHERE THE TWO GIRLS WERE CONCEALED A MESSAGE FOR HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS HE SAID AH AH CRIED THE SOLDIER OFFICER A MESSENGER

4071-39616-0008 AND AN ANIMATED WHISPERING BETRAYED THE EMOTION OF THE TWO GIRLS
4071-39616-0009 IN THE MEANTIME THE OBJECT OF SO MUCH LAUDABLE CURIOSITY CONTINUED HIS ROUTE FOLLOWING THE STEPS OF THE MAITRE D'HOTEL THE NOISE OF QUICK STEPS
4071-39616-0010 WARNED THEM THAT THEY WERE COMING TO THE END OF THEIR COURSE THE PAGES VALETS AND OFFICERS ASSEMBLED IN THE OFFICE WHICH LED UP TO THE REFECTORY WELCOMED THE NEWCOMER WITH THE PROVERBIAL POLITENESS OF THE COUNTRY SOME OF THEM WERE ACQUAINTED WITH RAOUL
4071-39616-0011 NOT INTO THE GLASS BUT UPON THE TABLECLOTH MADAME WHO WAS NOT SO PREOCCUPIED AS HER GLORIOUS SPOUSE WAS REMARKED THIS DISTRACTION OF THE PAGE WELL EXCLAIMED SHE WELL REPEATED MONSIEUR WHAT IS GOING ON THEN
4071-39616-0012 TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE MOMENT WHY AM I TO BE DISTURBED SAID GASTON
4071-39616-0013 WITH AN INQUIETUDE THAT ESCAPED NONE OF THE ASSISTANTS AND CONSEQUENTLY REDOUBLED THE GENERAL CURIOSITY
4071-39616-0014 IN WHICH EVERY MESSAGE WAS CONNECTED WITH A DARK AND COMPLICATED INTRIGUE PERHAPS LIKEWISE
4071-39616-0015 BENEATH THE ROOFS OF BLOIS TO THE PROPORTIONS OF A PHANTOM MONSIEUR PUSHED AWAY HIS PLATE SHALL I TELL THE ENVOY TO WAIT
4071-39616-0016 A GLANCE FROM MADAME EMBOLDENED GASTON WHO REPLIED NO NO LET HIM COME IN AT ONCE ON THE CONTRARY
4071-39616-0017 WHO IS HE A GENTLEMAN OF THIS COUNTRY
4071-39616-0018 WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED GRAVITY MONSIEUR TURNED HIS EYES IN A CERTAIN MANNER UPON THE PEOPLE OF HIS SUITE SO THAT ALL PAGES OFFICERS AND EQUERRIES QUITTED THE SERVICE KNIVES AND GOBLETS AND MADE TOWARDS THE SECOND CHAMBER DOOR A RETREAT AS RAPID AS IT WAS DISORDERLY
4071-39616-0019 THE SHORT INTERVAL OF SOLITUDE WHICH THIS RETREAT HAD LEFT HIM PERMITTED MONSIEUR THE TIME TO ASSUME A DIPLOMATIC COUNTENANCE HE DID NOT TURN ROUND BUT WAITED TILL THE MAITRE D'HOTEL SHOULD BRING THE MESSENGER FACE TO FACE WITH HIM
4071-39616-0020 RAOUL STOPPED EVEN WITH THE LOWER END OF THE TABLE SO AS TO BE EXACTLY BETWEEN MONSIEUR AND MADAME FROM THIS PLACE HE MADE A PROFOUND BOW TO MONSIEUR AND A VERY HUMBLE ONE TO MADAME THEN DRAWING HIMSELF UP INTO MILITARY POSE
4071-39616-0021 WHICH WOULD PROMISE HIM AT LEAST AN APPEARANCE OF SECRECY THE DOORS BEING CLOSED MONSIEUR RAISED HIS EYES TOWARDS THE VICOMTE AND SAID
4071-39616-0022 THIS MINUTE MONSEIGNEUR HOW IS THE KING HIS MAJESTY IS IN PERFECT HEALTH MONSEIGNEUR AND MY SISTER IN LAW HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN MOTHER STILL SUFFERS FROM THE COMPLAINT IN HER CHEST BUT FOR THE LAST MONTH SHE HAS BEEN RATHER BETTER
4071-39616-0023 UNSEALED IT AS HE WOULD HAVE UNSEALED A SUSPICIOUS PACKET AND IN ORDER TO READ IT SO THAT NO ONE SHOULD REMARK THE EFFECTS OF IT UPON HIS COUNTENANCE HE TURNED ROUND MADAME FOLLOWED WITH AN ANXIETY ALMOST EQUAL TO THAT OF THE PRINCE EVERY MANEUVER OF HER AUGUST HUSBAND
4071-39616-0024 RAOUL IMPASSIBLE AND A LITTLE DISENGAGED BY THE ATTENTION OF HIS HOSTS LOOKED FROM HIS PLACE THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW AT THE GARDENS AND THE STATUES WHICH PEOPLED THEM WELL CRIED MONSIEUR ALL AT ONCE WITH A CHEERFUL SMILE HERE IS AN AGREEABLE SURPRISE
4071-39616-0025 THE TABLE WAS TOO LARGE TO ALLOW THE ARM OF THE PRINCE TO REACH THE HAND OF MADAME
4071-39616-0026 AND DID IT WITH SO GOOD A GRACE AS TO PROCURE A FLATTERING ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM THE PRINCESS YOU KNOW THE CONTENTS OF THIS LETTER NO DOUBT SAID GASTON TO RAOUL
4071-39616-0027 BUT UPON REFLECTION HIS HIGHNESS TOOK UP HIS PEN IT IS BEAUTIFUL WRITING SAID MADAME BUT I CANNOT READ IT

4071-39616-0034 I DEPEND ON THE KING MY NEPHEW NOT HAVING TO REPENT OF THE FAVOR HE DOES MY HOUSE
4071-39616-0035 CRIED ALL THE OFFICERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD WITH FRANTIC ENTHUSIASM
4071-39616-0036 WHICH PASSED OVER HIM FOR A LONG TIME BEING UNACCUSTOMED TO HEAR IT HIS EAR HAD HAD REST
4071-39616-0037 MORE VIVACIOUS AND MORE BRILLIANT ROYALTY ROSE UP BEFORE HIM LIKE A NEW AND MORE PAINFUL PROVOCATION MADAME PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD THE SUFFERINGS OF THAT TIMID GLOOMY HEART SHE ROSE FROM THE TABLE MONSIEUR IMITATED HER MECHANICALLY
4071-39616-0038 AND ALL THE DOMESTICS WITH A BUZZING LIKE THAT OF SEVERAL BEE HIVES SURROUNDED RAOUL FOR THE PURPOSE OF QUESTIONING HIM MADAME SAW THIS MOVEMENT
