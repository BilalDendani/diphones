8713-296159-0000 CHAPTER TEN IT WAS THE THIRD WEEK IN AUGUST SUMMER WAS DYING AS A LONDON SUMMER DIES IN DAYS OF FEVERISH SUNLIGHT AND BREATHLESS LANGUOR
8713-296159-0001 IT WAS IN THE STREETS WITH THEIR SULTRY PALLOR IN THE PARKS AND SQUARES WHERE THE DUST LAY LIKE A GREY BLIGHT ON EVERY GREEN THING EVERYWHERE THE GLARE ACCENTUATED THIS TONELESS MELANCHOLY
8713-296159-0002 IT WAS THE SYMBOL OF THE DECADENCE FOLLOWING THE BRILLIANT EFFLORESCENCE OF THE SEASON THE EXHAUSTION AFTER THAT SUPREME EFFORT OF SOCIETY TO AMUSE ITSELF THIS LASSITUDE IS FELT MOST BY THOSE WHO HAVE SHARED LEAST IN THE AMUSEMENT
8713-296159-0003 THE WORKERS WHO MUST STAY BEHIND IN THE GREAT WORKSHOP
8713-296159-0004 LANGLEY WYNDHAM HAD REASONS FOR CONGRATULATING HIMSELF THAT EVERYBODY WAS OUT OF TOWN AND THAT HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF IN HIS ROOMS IN DOVER STREET FOR ONE THING IT GAVE HIM OPPORTUNITY FOR CULTIVATING MISS CRAVEN'S ACQUAINTANCE
8713-296159-0005 FOR ANOTHER HE HAD NOW A LUXURIOUS LEISURE IN WHICH TO POLISH UP THE PROOFS OF HIS LAST NOVEL AND TO ARRANGE HIS IDEAS FOR ITS SUCCESSOR COMPARED WITH THIS GREAT WORK ALL FORMER EFFORTS WOULD SEEM TO THE TASTE THEY HAD CREATED AS SO MUCH LITERARY TRIFLING
8713-296159-0006 HITHERTO HE HAD BEEN MERELY TRYING HIS INSTRUMENT RUNNING HIS FINGERS OVER THE KEYS IN HIS EASY PROFESSIONAL WAY BUT THESE PRELIMINARY FLOURISHES GAVE NO IDEA OF THE CONSTRUCTIVE HARMONIES TO FOLLOW
8713-296159-0007 AND NOW ON A DULL EVENING SOME THREE WEEKS AFTER AUDREY'S DINNER PARTY HE WAS ALONE IN HIS STUDY SMOKING AS HE LEANED BACK IN HIS EASY CHAIR IN ONE OF THOSE DREAMY MOODS WHICH WITH HIM MEANT FICTION IN THE MAKING
8713-296159-0008 THE TOBACCO SMOKE CURLING ROUND HIS HEAD THE PYTHIAN FUMES OF HIS INSPIRATION THE STUDY WAS CURIOUSLY SUGGESTIVE OF ITS OWNER'S INCONSISTENCIES WITH ITS SILK CUSHIONS ORIENTAL RUGS AND VELVET DRAPERIES
8713-296159-0009 ITS LINING OF BOOKS AND WRITING TABLE HEAPED WITH MANUSCRIPTS AND PROOFS IT WITNESSED TO HIS IMPARTIAL LOVE OF LUXURY AND HARD WORK IT TOLD OTHER SECRETS TOO THE CIGAR CASE ON THE TABLE BESIDE HIM
8713-296159-0010 THE INITIALS L W WORKED WITH GOLD THREAD IN A RAISED MONOGRAM TWO OR THREE PHOTOGRAPHS OF PRETTY WOMEN WERE STUCK BY THEIR CORNERS BEHIND THE BIG LOOKING GLASS OVER THE FIREPLACE TOGETHER WITH INVITATION CARDS FRIVOLOUS LITTLE NOTES AND BALL PROGRAMMES
8713-296159-0011 ON THE OTHER THE ONE NEAREST WYNDHAM'S CHAIR AN EMPTY FRAME OF SOLID SILVER THE PHOTOGRAPH AND THE FRAME REPRESENTED THE FRIENDSHIP AND THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE TO NIGHT HE HAD LEFT HIS PROOFS UNTOUCHED ON THE WRITING TABLE
8713-296159-0012 AND HAD SETTLED HIMSELF COMFORTABLY TO HIS PIPE WITH THE VOLUPTUOUS SATISFACTION OF A MAN WHO HAS PUT OFF A DISAGREEABLE DUTY HE FELT THAT DELICIOUS TURMOIL OF IDEAS WHICH WITH HIM ACCOMPANIED THE BUILDING UP OF A STORY ROUND ITS CENTRAL CHARACTER
8713-296159-0013 NOT THAT HE YET UNDERSTOOD THAT CHARACTER WYNDHAM HAD HIS INTUITIONS BUT HE WAS NOT THE MAN TO TRUST THEM AS SUCH IT WAS HIS HABIT TO VERIFY THEM BY A SUBSEQUENT LOGIC
8713-296159-0014 HIS LITERARY CONSCIENCE ALLOWED NOTHING TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL METHOD THE CAREFUL OBSERVATION AND ARRANGING OF MINUTE FACTS INTIMATE ANALYTICAL STUDY FROM THE LIFE NO ACTION WAS TOO SMALL NO EMOTION TOO INSIGNIFICANT
8713-296159-0015 FOR HIS UNCOMPROMISING REALISM HE HAD APPLIED THE SAME METHOD TO HIS OWN EXPERIENCE WHATEVER CAME IN HIS WAY THE TRAGEDY OR COMEDY OF HIS DAILY LIFE HIS MOODS OF PASSION AND APATHY THE ASPIRATIONS OF HIS BETTER MOMENTS
8713-296159-0016 ALL UNDERWENT THE SAME DISINTEGRATING PROCESS HE HAD THE POWER OF STANDING ALOOF FROM HIMSELF OF ARRESTING THE FLIGHT OF HIS OWN SENSATIONS AND CRITICISING HIS OWN ACTIONS AS A DISINTERESTED SPECTATOR
8713-296159-0017 THUS HE MADE NO EXPERIMENT ON OTHERS THAT HE HAD NOT FIRST TRIED ON HIS OWN PERSON IF ANY MAN EVER UNDERSTOOD HIMSELF THAT MAN WAS LANGLEY WYNDHAM HE WAS BY NO MEANS VAIN OF THIS DISTINCTION ON THE CONTRARY HE WOULD HAVE SAID
8713-296159-0018 THAT AS A MAN'S INNER CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE ONLY THING HE HAS ANY DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF HE MUST BE A FOOL IF HE CAN LIVE WITH HIMSELF THE CLOSEST OF ALL HUMAN RELATIONS FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING HIS OWN CHARACTER
8713-296159-0019 AND THE LITTLE HE KNEW OF INDIVIDUALS HAD NOT TENDED TO RAISE HIS OPINION OF WOMEN IN GENERAL CONSEQUENTLY HE DREW THEM ALL AS HE SAW THEM FROM THE OUTSIDE THE BEST SORT WITH A CERTAIN DELICACY AND CLEARNESS OF OUTLINE
8713-296159-0020 THE RESULT OF UNERRING EYESIGHT AND THE GIFT OF STYLE THE WORST SORT WITH AN INCISIVE ALMOST BRUTAL TOUCH THAT SUGGESTED THE BLACK LINES BITTEN OUT BY SOME POWERFUL ACID HIS WORK TOOK BECAUSE OF ITS COARSER QUALITIES
8713-296159-0021 THE ACCENTUATED BITTERNESS THE STARTLING IRONY THE VIGOROUS CHARACTERISTIC PHRASE THOSE BLACK STROKES WERE NOT INTRODUCED TO THROW UP THE GREY WASH OR PENCILLED SHADING WYNDHAM'S CYNICISM WAS NO MERE LITERARY AFFECTATION
8713-296159-0022 IT WAS ENGRAINED IN HIS VERY NATURE HE HAD GONE THROUGH MANY PHASES OF DISILLUSIONMENT INCLUDING DISGUST AT HIS OWN SUCCESS BEFORE THAT BRIEF CRISIS OF FEELING WHICH ENDED IN HIS ENGAGEMENT TO MISS FRASER
8713-296159-0023 THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE A WOMAN'S NATURE HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HIM TO KNOW IT WAS A GLORIOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BORN ANALYST AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE LET AN OPPORTUNITY GO HE LOVED ALISON FRASER
8713-296159-0024 AND HE FOUND THAT LOVE MADE UNDERSTANDING IMPOSSIBLE HE NEVER WANTED TO UNDERSTAND HER THE RELENTLESS PASSION FOR ANALYSIS WAS ABSORBED IN A COMPREHENSIVE ENTHUSIASM WHICH EMBRACED THE WHOLE OF ALISON AND TOOK NO COUNT OF THE PARTS
8713-296159-0025 EVEN WITH A VIEW TO RECONSTRUCTION
8713-296159-0026 FOR A WHOLE YEAR THE STUDENT OF THE EARTHLY AND THE VISIBLE LIVED ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THINGS UNSEEN ON FAITH IN THE GOODNESS OF ALISON FRASER
8713-296159-0027 WHICH MADE HER GIVE UP WYNDHAM AS MISS GLADYS ARMSTRONG HAD GUESSED OR AS SHE WOULD HAVE PUT IT DIAGNOSED A DETAIL OF WYNDHAM'S PAST LIFE HAD COME TO MISS FRASER'S KNOWLEDGE AS THESE DETAILS ALWAYS COME THROUGH A WELL MEANING FRIEND
8713-296159-0028 FLATTERING THE EGOISM INHERENT EVEN IN THE VERY GOOD BECAUSE SHE WAS WEAK AND HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY STRONG SHE CUT HERSELF FROM HIM DELIBERATELY OPEN EYED AND WITH ONE STROKE
8713-296159-0029 SHE HAD JUST SUFFICIENT STRENGTH FOR THE SUDDEN BREAKING OFF OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT NONE FOR EXPLANATION AND NONE ALAS TO SAVE HER FROM REGRETTING HER ACT OF SUPEREROGATORY VIRTUE WYNDHAM GAVE NO SIGN OF SUFFERING
8713-296159-0030 HE SIMPLY SANK BACK INTO HIMSELF AND BECAME THE MAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE PLUS HIS EXPERIENCE OF FEELING AND MINUS THE INGENUOUSNESS OF HIS SELF KNOWLEDGE HE TOOK INSTEAD TO SELF MYSTIFICATION
8713-296159-0031 THEREFORE ALL WOMEN WERE UNWORTHY EXCEPT FOR PURELY LITERARY PURPOSES HE HAD DONE WITH THE SEX HE BECAME IF ANYTHING MORE INTENTLY MORE REMORSELESSLY ANALYTICAL MORE ABSOLUTELY THE STUDENT OF HUMAN NATURE
8713-296159-0032 HE LIVED NOW IN AND FOR HIS WORK HE STRUCK OUT INTO NEW PATHS HE WAS TIRED OF HIS NEUTRAL WASHES AND STRIKING EFFECTS IN BLACK AND WHITE
8713-296159-0033 NOVELS WERE LYING IN HIS HEAD TEN DEEP HE HAD WHOLE NOTE BOOKS FULL OF GERMS AND EMBRYOS ALL NEATLY ARRANGED IN THEIR SEPARATE PIGEON HOLES IN SOME HE HAD JOTTED DOWN A NAME AND A DATE OR A WORD WHICH STOOD FOR A WHOLE TRAIN OF IDEAS
8713-296159-0034 IN OTHERS HE HAD RECORDED SOME ILLUSTRATION AS IT OCCURRED TO HIM OR A SINGLE SENTENCE STOOD FLANKED BY A DOZEN VARIANTS WYNDHAM BEING A CAREFUL WORKER AND SENSITIVE TO NICETIES OF LANGUAGE TO NIGHT HE WAS SUPREMELY HAPPY
8713-296159-0035 HE SAW HIS WAY TO A LOVELY LITTLE BIT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL REALISM ALL THAT HAD BEEN HITHERTO WANTING TO THIS PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT OF HIS ART HAD BEEN THE WOMAN IN AUDREY CRAVEN HE HAD FOUND THE INDISPENSABLE THING
8713-296159-0036 INTIMACY WITHOUT LOVE OR EVEN AS HE UNDERSTOOD THE WORD FRIENDSHIP SHE WAS THE TYPE HE HAD LONG DESIRED THE FEMININE CREATURE ARTLESS IN PERPETUAL ARTIFICE FOR EVER REVEALING HERSELF IN A SUCCESSION OF DISGUISES
8713-296159-0037 HE WAS BEGINNING TO ADJUST HIS LATEST IMPRESSIONS TO HIS EARLIER IDEA OF HER HE RECALLED THE EVENING WHEN HE HAD FIRST SEEN HER THE HOT CROWDED DRAWING ROOM THE HEAVY ATMOSPHERE THE DULL FACES COMING AND GOING
8713-296159-0038 AND THE FIGURE OF AUDREY FLASHING THROUGH IT ALL SHE HAD IRRITATED HIM THEN FOR HE HAD NOT YET CLASSIFIED HER HE HAD TRIED NOT TO THINK OF HER SHE DOGGED HIS THOUGHTS WITH MOST UNMAIDENLY INSISTENCE
8713-296159-0039 HER IMAGE LAY IN WAIT FOR HIM AT EVERY CROSS ROAD OF ASSOCIATION IT WAS SOMETHING VIVID YET ELUSIVE PROTEAN YET PERSISTENT HE RECALLED THAT OTHER EVENING OF HER DINNER PARTY THEIR FIRST RECOGNISED MEETING HER WHOLE PERSON WHICH AT FIRST SIGHT HAD IMPRESSED HIM
8713-296159-0040 WITH ITS EMPHATIC INDIVIDUALITY NOW STRUCK HIM AS CHARACTERLESS AND CONVENTIONAL AND YET WHAT WAS SHE LIKE SHE WAS LIKE A CHAMELEON NO SHE WASN'T
8713-296159-0041 SHE WAS LIKE AN OPAL ALL SPARKLE WHEN YOU MOVE IT AND AT REST DULL MOST UNDENIABLY DULL NO THAT WASN'T IT EXACTLY SHE WAS A LOOKING GLASS FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S PERSONALITIES HE HATED THE HORRID WORD AND APOLOGISED TO HIMSELF FOR USING IT
8713-296159-0042 FORMLESS AND COLOURLESS
8713-296159-0043 AFTER A MOMENT'S SATISFACTION WITH THIS LAST FANCY HE BECAME AWARE THAT HE WAS BEING MADE THE FOOL OF METAPHOR THAT WAS NOT HIS WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT LAY AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS SHIFTING PERSONALITY
8713-296159-0044 WHAT ELEMENTAL THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS IF ANY THE REAL AUDREY WAS COMPOSED OF TO SEE FOR HIMSELF THE PLAY OF CIRCUMSTANCES ON HER PLASTIC NATURE
8713-296159-0045 AND KNOW WHAT REACTION IT WAS CAPABLE OF IN A WORD TO EXPERIMENTALISE IN COLD BLOOD ON THE LIVING NERVE AND BRAIN TISSUE WAS HIS PLAN OF WORK FOR THE YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETY SIX MAKING A MENTAL NOTE OF SEVERAL OF THE ABOVE PHRASES FOR FUTURE USE
8713-296159-0046 WYNDHAM KNOCKED THE ASHES OUT OF HIS PIPE AND WENT TO BED
