8404-282926-0000 THE CISCO KID HAD KILLED SIX MEN IN MORE OR LESS FAIR SCRIMMAGES HAD MURDERED TWICE AS MANY MOSTLY MEXICANS AND HAD WINGED A LARGER NUMBER WHOM HE MODESTLY FORBORE TO COUNT
8404-282926-0001 THE KID WAS TWENTY FIVE LOOKED TWENTY
8404-282926-0002 HE KILLED FOR THE LOVE OF IT BECAUSE HE WAS QUICK TEMPERED TO AVOID ARREST FOR HIS OWN AMUSEMENT ANY REASON THAT CAME TO HIS MIND WOULD SUFFICE HE HAD ESCAPED CAPTURE BECAUSE HE COULD SHOOT FIVE SIXTHS OF A SECOND SOONER
8404-282926-0003 THAN ANY SHERIFF OR RANGER IN THE SERVICE AND BECAUSE HE RODE A SPECKLED ROAN HORSE THAT KNEW EVERY COW PATH IN THE MESQUITE AND PEAR THICKETS FROM SAN ANTONIO TO MATAMORAS TONIA PEREZ THE GIRL WHO LOVED THE CISCO KID
8404-282926-0004 WAS HALF CARMEN HALF MADONNA AND THE REST OH YES A WOMAN WHO IS HALF CARMEN AND HALF MADONNA CAN ALWAYS BE SOMETHING MORE THE REST LET US SAY WAS HUMMING BIRD SHE LIVED IN A GRASS ROOFED JACAL
8404-282926-0005 NEAR A LITTLE MEXICAN SETTLEMENT AT THE LONE WOLF CROSSING OF THE FRIO WITH HER LIVED A FATHER OR GRANDFATHER A LINEAL AZTEC SOMEWHAT LESS THAN A THOUSAND YEARS OLD WHO HERDED A HUNDRED GOATS AND LIVED IN A CONTINUOUS DRUNKEN DREAM FROM DRINKING MESCAL
8404-282926-0006 A TREMENDOUS FOREST OF BRISTLING PEAR TWENTY FEET HIGH AT ITS WORST CROWDED ALMOST TO ITS DOOR
8404-282926-0007 THAT THE SPECKLED ROAN WOULD BRING THE KID TO SEE HIS GIRL AND ONCE CLINGING LIKE A LIZARD TO THE RIDGE POLE HIGH UP UNDER THE PEAKED GRASS ROOF HE HAD HEARD TONIA WITH HER MADONNA FACE AND CARMEN BEAUTY AND HUMMING BIRD SOUL PARLEY WITH THE SHERIFF'S POSSE
8404-282926-0008 ONE DAY THE ADJUTANT GENERAL OF THE STATE
8404-282926-0009 WROTE SOME SARCASTIC LINES TO CAPTAIN DUVAL OF COMPANY X STATIONED AT LAREDO RELATIVE TO THE SERENE AND UNDISTURBED EXISTENCE LED BY MURDERERS AND DESPERADOES IN THE SAID CAPTAIN'S TERRITORY
8404-282926-0010 AND FORWARDED THE LETTER AFTER ADDING A FEW COMMENTS PER RANGER PRIVATE BILL ADAMSON TO RANGER LIEUTENANT SANDRIDGE CAMPED AT A WATER HOLE ON THE NUECES WITH A SQUAD OF FIVE MEN IN PRESERVATION OF LAW AND ORDER
8404-282926-0011 LIEUTENANT SANDRIDGE TURNED A BEAUTIFUL COULEUR DE ROSE THROUGH HIS ORDINARY STRAWBERRY COMPLEXION TUCKED THE LETTER IN HIS HIP POCKET AND CHEWED OFF THE ENDS OF HIS GAMBOGE MOUSTACHE
8404-282926-0012 THE NEXT MORNING HE SADDLED HIS HORSE AND RODE ALONE TO THE MEXICAN SETTLEMENT AT THE LONE WOLF CROSSING OF THE FRIO TWENTY MILES AWAY SIX FEET TWO BLOND AS A VIKING QUIET AS A DEACON DANGEROUS AS A MACHINE GUN
8404-282926-0013 PATIENTLY SEEKING NEWS OF THE CISCO KID FAR MORE THAN THE LAW THE MEXICANS DREADED THE COLD AND CERTAIN VENGEANCE OF THE LONE RIDER THAT THE RANGER SOUGHT IT HAD BEEN ONE OF THE KID'S PASTIMES TO SHOOT MEXICANS TO SEE THEM KICK
8404-282926-0014 IF HE DEMANDED FROM THEM MORIBUND TERPSICHOREAN FEATS SIMPLY THAT HE MIGHT BE ENTERTAINED WHAT TERRIBLE AND EXTREME PENALTIES WOULD BE CERTAIN TO FOLLOW SHOULD THEY ANGER HIM ONE AND ALL THEY LOUNGED WITH UPTURNED PALMS AND SHRUGGING SHOULDERS
8404-282926-0015 BUT THERE WAS A MAN NAMED FINK WHO KEPT A STORE AT THE CROSSING A MAN OF MANY NATIONALITIES TONGUES INTERESTS AND WAYS OF THINKING NO USE TO ASK THEM MEXICANS HE SAID TO SANDRIDGE THEY'RE AFRAID TO TELL
8404-282926-0016 GOODALL IS HIS NAME AIN'T IT HE'S BEEN IN MY STORE ONCE OR TWICE I HAVE AN IDEA YOU MIGHT RUN ACROSS HIM AT BUT I GUESS I DON'T KEER TO SAY MYSELF I'M TWO SECONDS LATER IN PULLING A GUN THAN I USED TO BE AND THE DIFFERENCE IS WORTH THINKING ABOUT
8404-282926-0017 BUT THIS KID'S GOT A HALF MEXICAN GIRL AT THE CROSSING THAT HE COMES TO SEE SHE LIVES IN THAT JACAL A HUNDRED YARDS DOWN THE ARROYO AT THE EDGE OF THE PEAR MAYBE SHE NO I DON'T SUPPOSE SHE WOULD
8404-282926-0018 THE SUN WAS LOW AND THE BROAD SHADE OF THE GREAT PEAR THICKET ALREADY COVERED THE GRASS THATCHED HUT THE GOATS WERE ENCLOSED FOR THE NIGHT IN A BRUSH CORRAL NEAR BY A FEW KIDS WALKED THE TOP OF IT NIBBLING THE CHAPARRAL LEAVES
8404-282926-0019 THE OLD MEXICAN LAY UPON A BLANKET ON THE GRASS ALREADY IN A STUPOR FROM HIS MESCAL AND DREAMING PERHAPS OF THE NIGHTS WHEN HE AND PIZARRO TOUCHED GLASSES TO THEIR NEW WORLD FORTUNES
8404-282926-0020 AND LIEUTENANT SANDRIDGE SAT IN HIS SADDLE STARING AT HER LIKE A GANNET AGAPE AT A SAILORMAN THE CISCO KID WAS A VAIN PERSON AS ALL EMINENT AND SUCCESSFUL ASSASSINS ARE AND HIS BOSOM WOULD HAVE BEEN RUFFLED
8404-282926-0021 HAD HE KNOWN THAT AT A SIMPLE EXCHANGE OF GLANCES TWO PERSONS IN WHOSE MINDS HE HAD BEEN LOOMING LARGE SUDDENLY ABANDONED AT LEAST FOR THE TIME ALL THOUGHT OF HIM NEVER BEFORE HAD TONIA SEEN SUCH A MAN AS THIS
8404-282926-0022 HE SEEMED TO BE MADE OF SUNSHINE AND BLOOD RED TISSUE AND CLEAR WEATHER HE SEEMED TO ILLUMINATE THE SHADOW OF THE PEAR WHEN HE SMILED AS THOUGH THE SUN WERE RISING AGAIN THE MEN SHE HAD KNOWN HAD BEEN SMALL AND DARK
8404-282926-0023 EVEN THE KID IN SPITE OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS WAS A STRIPLING NO LARGER THAN HERSELF WITH BLACK STRAIGHT HAIR AND A COLD MARBLE FACE THAT CHILLED THE NOONDAY AS FOR TONIA THOUGH SHE SENDS DESCRIPTION TO THE POORHOUSE
8404-282926-0024 LET HER MAKE A MILLIONAIRE OF YOUR FANCY HER BLUE BLACK HAIR SMOOTHLY DIVIDED IN THE MIDDLE AND BOUND CLOSE TO HER HEAD AND HER LARGE EYES FULL OF THE LATIN MELANCHOLY GAVE HER THE MADONNA TOUCH HER MOTIONS AND AIR SPOKE OF THE CONCEALED FIRE
8404-282926-0025 AND THE DESIRE TO CHARM THAT SHE HAD INHERITED FROM THE GITANAS OF THE BASQUE PROVINCE AS FOR THE HUMMING BIRD PART OF HER THAT DWELT IN HER HEART YOU COULD NOT PERCEIVE IT UNLESS HER BRIGHT RED SKIRT AND DARK BLUE BLOUSE
8404-282926-0026 THE NEWLY LIGHTED SUN GOD ASKED FOR A DRINK OF WATER TONIA BROUGHT IT FROM THE RED JAR HANGING UNDER THE BRUSH SHELTER SANDRIDGE CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO DISMOUNT SO AS TO LESSEN THE TROUBLE OF HER MINISTRATIONS I PLAY NO SPY
8404-282926-0027 NOR DO I ASSUME TO MASTER THE THOUGHTS OF ANY HUMAN HEART BUT I ASSERT BY THE CHRONICLER'S RIGHT THAT BEFORE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HAD SPED SANDRIDGE WAS TEACHING HER HOW TO PLAINT A SIX STRAND RAWHIDE STAKE ROPE
8404-282926-0028 AND TONIA HAD EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT WERE IT NOT FOR HER LITTLE ENGLISH BOOK THAT THE PERIPATETIC PADRE HAD GIVEN HER AND THE LITTLE CRIPPLED CHIVO
8404-282926-0029 SHE WOULD BE VERY VERY LONELY INDEED WHICH LEADS TO A SUSPICION THAT THE KID'S FENCES NEEDED REPAIRING AND THAT THE ADJUTANT GENERAL'S SARCASM HAD FALLEN UPON UNPRODUCTIVE SOIL IN HIS CAMP BY THE WATER HOLE LIEUTENANT SANDRIDGE
8404-282926-0030 ANNOUNCED AND REITERATED HIS INTENTION OF EITHER CAUSING THE CISCO KID TO NIBBLE THE BLACK LOAM OF THE FRIO COUNTRY PRAIRIES OR OF HALING HIM BEFORE A JUDGE AND JURY THAT SOUNDED BUSINESS LIKE TWICE A WEEK HE RODE OVER TO THE LONE WOLF CROSSING OF THE FRIO
8404-282926-0031 AND DIRECTED TONIA'S SLIM SLIGHTLY LEMON TINTED FINGERS AMONG THE INTRICACIES OF THE SLOWLY GROWING LARIATA A SIX STRAND PLAIT IS HARD TO LEARN AND EASY TO TEACH
8404-282926-0032 THE RANGER KNEW THAT HE MIGHT FIND THE KID THERE AT ANY VISIT HE KEPT HIS ARMAMENT READY
8404-282926-0033 THUS HE MIGHT BRING DOWN THE KITE AND THE HUMMING BIRD WITH ONE STONE WHILE THE SUNNY HAIRED ORNITHOLOGIST WAS PURSUING HIS STUDIES THE CISCO KID WAS ALSO ATTENDING TO HIS PROFESSIONAL DUTIES
8404-282926-0034 HE MOODILY SHOT UP A SALOON IN A SMALL COW VILLAGE ON QUINTANA CREEK KILLED THE TOWN MARSHAL PLUGGING HIM NEATLY IN THE CENTRE OF HIS TIN BADGE AND THEN RODE AWAY MOROSE AND UNSATISFIED
8404-282926-0035 HE YEARNED FOR THE WOMAN HE LOVED TO REASSURE HIM THAT SHE WAS HIS IN SPITE OF IT HE WANTED HER TO CALL HIS BLOODTHIRSTINESS BRAVERY AND HIS CRUELTY DEVOTION HE WANTED TONIA TO BRING HIM WATER FROM THE RED JAR UNDER THE BRUSH SHELTER
8404-282926-0036 AND TELL HIM HOW THE CHIVO WAS THRIVING ON THE BOTTLE THE KID TURNED THE SPECKLED ROAN'S HEAD UP THE TEN MILE PEAR FLAT THAT STRETCHES ALONG THE ARROYO HONDO UNTIL IT ENDS AT THE LONE WOLF CROSSING OF THE FRIO THE ROAN WHICKERED
8404-282926-0037 FOR HE HAD A SENSE OF LOCALITY AND DIRECTION EQUAL TO THAT OF A BELT LINE STREET CAR HORSE AND HE KNEW HE WOULD SOON BE NIBBLING THE RICH MESQUITE GRASS AT THE END OF A FORTY FOOT STAKE ROPE
8404-282926-0038 MORE WEIRD AND LONESOME THAN THE JOURNEY OF AN AMAZONIAN EXPLORER IS THE RIDE OF ONE THROUGH A TEXAS PEAR FLAT WITH DISMAL MONOTONY AND STARTLING VARIETY THE UNCANNY AND MULTIFORM SHAPES OF THE CACTI
8404-282926-0039 LIFT THEIR TWISTED TRUNKS AND FAT BRISTLY HANDS TO ENCUMBER THE WAY THE DEMON PLANT APPEARING TO LIVE WITHOUT SOIL OR RAIN SEEMS TO TAUNT THE PARCHED TRAVELLER WITH ITS LUSH GREY GREENNESS
8404-282926-0040 IT WARPS ITSELF A THOUSAND TIMES ABOUT WHAT LOOK TO BE OPEN AND INVITING PATHS ONLY TO LURE THE RIDER INTO BLIND AND IMPASSABLE SPINE DEFENDED BOTTOMS OF THE BAG LEAVING HIM TO RETREAT IF HE CAN
8404-282926-0041 WITH THE POINTS OF THE COMPASS WHIRLING IN HIS HEAD TO BE LOST IN THE PEAR IS TO DIE ALMOST THE DEATH OF THE THIEF ON THE CROSS PIERCED BY NAILS AND WITH GROTESQUE SHAPES OF ALL THE FIENDS HOVERING ABOUT BUT IT WAS NOT SO WITH THE KID AND HIS MOUNT
8404-282926-0042 WINDING TWISTING CIRCLING TRACING THE MOST FANTASTIC AND BEWILDERING TRAIL EVER PICKED OUT THE GOOD ROAN LESSENED THE DISTANCE TO THE LONE WOLF CROSSING WITH EVERY COIL AND TURN THAT HE MADE WHILE THEY FARED THE KID SANG
8404-282926-0043 HE KNEW BUT ONE TUNE AND SANG IT AS HE KNEW BUT ONE CODE AND LIVED IT AND BUT ONE GIRL AND LOVED HER HE WAS A SINGLE MINDED MAN OF CONVENTIONAL IDEAS HE HAD A VOICE LIKE A COYOTE WITH BRONCHITIS BUT WHENEVER HE CHOSE TO SING HIS SONG HE SANG IT
8404-282926-0044 IT WAS A CONVENTIONAL SONG OF THE CAMPS AND TRAIL
8404-282926-0045 DON'T YOU MONKEY WITH MY LULU GIRL OR I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO AND SO ON THE ROAN WAS INURED TO IT AND DID NOT MIND
8404-282926-0046 AS THOUGH HE WERE IN A CIRCUS RING THE SPECKLED ROAN WHEELED AND DANCED THROUGH THE LABYRINTH OF PEAR UNTIL AT LENGTH HIS RIDER KNEW BY CERTAIN LANDMARKS THAT THE LONE WOLF CROSSING WAS CLOSE AT HAND THEN WHERE THE PEAR WAS THINNER
8404-282926-0047 AND THE HACKBERRY TREE ON THE EDGE OF THE ARROYO A FEW YARDS FARTHER THE KID STOPPED THE ROAN AND GAZED INTENTLY THROUGH THE PRICKLY OPENINGS THEN HE DISMOUNTED DROPPED THE ROAN'S REINS AND PROCEEDED ON FOOT STOOPING AND SILENT LIKE AN INDIAN
8404-282926-0048 THE ROAN KNOWING HIS PART STOOD STILL MAKING NO SOUND THE KID CREPT NOISELESSLY TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE PEAR THICKET AND RECONNOITRED BETWEEN THE LEAVES OF A CLUMP OF CACTUS TEN YARDS FROM HIS HIDING PLACE
8404-282926-0049 SAT HIS TONIA CALMLY PLAITING A RAWHIDE LARIAT SO FAR SHE MIGHT SURELY ESCAPE CONDEMNATION WOMEN HAVE BEEN KNOWN FROM TIME TO TIME TO ENGAGE IN MORE MISCHIEVOUS OCCUPATIONS BUT IF ALL MUST BE TOLD THERE IS TO BE ADDED
8404-282926-0050 THAT HER HEAD REPOSED AGAINST THE BROAD AND COMFORTABLE CHEST OF A TALL RED AND YELLOW MAN AND THAT HIS ARM WAS ABOUT HER GUIDING HER NIMBLE FINGERS THAT REQUIRED SO MANY LESSONS AT THE INTRICATE SIX STRAND PLAIT
8404-282926-0051 SANDRIDGE GLANCED QUICKLY AT THE DARK MASS OF PEAR WHEN HE HEARD A SLIGHT SQUEAKING SOUND THAT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER UNFAMILIAR A GUN SCABBARD WILL MAKE THAT SOUND WHEN ONE GRASPS THE HANDLE OF A SIX SHOOTER SUDDENLY BUT THE SOUND WAS NOT REPEATED
8404-282926-0052 AND TONIA'S FINGERS NEEDED CLOSE ATTENTION AND THEN IN THE SHADOW OF DEATH THEY BEGAN TO TALK OF THEIR LOVE AND IN THE STILL JULY AFTERNOON EVERY WORD THEY UTTERED REACHED THE EARS OF THE KID REMEMBER THEN SAID TONIA
8404-282926-0053 YOU MUST NOT COME AGAIN UNTIL I SEND FOR YOU SOON HE WILL BE HERE
8404-282926-0054 HE SAW HIM ON THE GUADALUPE THREE DAYS AGO WHEN HE IS THAT NEAR HE ALWAYS COMES IF HE COMES AND FINDS YOU HERE HE WILL KILL YOU SO FOR MY SAKE YOU MUST COME NO MORE UNTIL I SEND YOU THE WORD ALL RIGHT SAID THE STRANGER AND THEN WHAT
8404-282926-0055 AND THEN SAID THE GIRL YOU MUST BRING YOUR MEN HERE AND KILL HIM IF NOT HE WILL KILL YOU HE AIN'T A MAN TO SURRENDER THAT'S SURE SAID SANDRIDGE IT'S KILL OR BE KILLED FOR THE OFFICER THAT GOES UP AGAINST MISTER CISCO KID
8404-282926-0056 HE MUST DIE SAID THE GIRL OTHERWISE THERE WILL NOT BE ANY PEACE IN THE WORLD FOR THEE AND ME HE HAS KILLED MANY
8404-282926-0057 BRING YOUR MEN AND GIVE HIM NO CHANCE TO ESCAPE YOU USED TO THINK RIGHT MUCH OF HIM SAID SANDRIDGE TONIA DROPPED THE LARIAT
8404-282926-0058 AND CURVED A LEMON TINTED ARM OVER THE RANGER'S SHOULDER BUT THEN SHE MURMURED IN LIQUID SPANISH I HAD NOT BEHELD THEE THOU GREAT RED MOUNTAIN OF A MAN AND THOU ART KIND AND GOOD AS WELL AS STRONG
8404-282926-0059 COULD ONE CHOOSE HIM KNOWING THEE LET HIM DIE FOR THEN I WILL NOT BE FILLED WITH FEAR BY DAY AND NIGHT LEST HE HURT THEE OR ME HOW CAN I KNOW WHEN HE COMES ASKED SANDRIDGE WHEN HE COMES SAID TONIA
8404-282926-0060 HE REMAINS TWO DAYS SOMETIMES THREE GREGORIO THE SMALL SON OF OLD LUISA THE LAVENDERA HAS A SWIFT PONY I WILL WRITE A LETTER TO THEE AND SEND IT BY HIM SAYING HOW IT WILL BE BEST TO COME UPON HIM
8404-282926-0061 AND BRING MANY MEN WITH THEE AND HAVE MUCH CARE OH DEAR RED ONE FOR THE RATTLESNAKE IS NOT QUICKER TO STRIKE THAN IS EL CHIVATO AS THEY CALL HIM TO SEND A BALL FROM HIS PISTOLA
8404-282926-0062 THE KID'S HANDY WITH HIS GUN SURE ENOUGH ADMITTED SANDRIDGE BUT WHEN I COME FOR HIM I SHALL COME ALONE I'LL GET HIM BY MYSELF OR NOT AT ALL THE CAP WROTE ONE OR TWO THINGS TO ME THAT MAKE ME WANT TO DO THE TRICK WITHOUT ANY HELP
8404-282926-0063 YOU LET ME KNOW WHEN MISTER KID ARRIVES AND I'LL DO THE REST I WILL SEND YOU THE MESSAGE BY THE BOY GREGORIO SAID THE GIRL I KNEW YOU WERE BRAVER THAN THAT SMALL SLAYER OF MEN WHO NEVER SMILES HOW COULD I EVER HAVE THOUGHT I CARED FOR HIM
8404-282926-0064 IT WAS TIME FOR THE RANGER TO RIDE BACK TO HIS CAMP ON THE WATER HOLE
8404-282926-0065 FOR A PARTING SALUTE THE DROWSY STILLNESS OF THE TORPID SUMMER AIR STILL LAY THICK UPON THE DREAMING AFTERNOON
8404-282926-0066 ROSE STRAIGHT AS A PLUMB LINE ABOVE THE CLAY DAUBED CHIMNEY NO SOUND OR MOVEMENT DISTURBED THE SERENITY OF THE DENSE PEAR THICKET TEN YARDS AWAY WHEN THE FORM OF SANDRIDGE HAD DISAPPEARED LOPING HIS BIG DUN DOWN THE STEEP BANKS OF THE FRIO CROSSING
8404-282926-0067 THE KID CREPT BACK TO HIS OWN HORSE MOUNTED HIM
8404-282926-0068 BUT NOT FAR HE STOPPED AND WAITED IN THE SILENT DEPTHS OF THE PEAR UNTIL HALF AN HOUR HAD PASSED AND THEN TONIA HEARD THE HIGH UNTRUE NOTES OF HIS UNMUSICAL SINGING
8404-282926-0069 THE KID SELDOM SMILED BUT HE SMILED AND WAVED HIS HAT WHEN HE SAW HER HE DISMOUNTED AND HIS GIRL SPRANG INTO HIS ARMS THE KID LOOKED AT HER FONDLY HIS THICK BLACK HAIR CLUNG TO HIS HEAD LIKE A WRINKLED MAT
8404-282926-0070 THE MEETING BROUGHT A SLIGHT RIPPLE OF SOME UNDERCURRENT OF FEELING TO HIS SMOOTH DARK FACE THAT WAS USUALLY AS MOTIONLESS AS A CLAY MASK HOW'S MY GIRL HE ASKED HOLDING HER CLOSE SICK OF WAITING SO LONG FOR YOU DEAR ONE SHE ANSWERED
8404-282926-0071 MY EYES ARE DIM WITH ALWAYS GAZING INTO THAT DEVIL'S PINCUSHION THROUGH WHICH YOU COME AND I CAN SEE INTO IT SUCH A LITTLE WAY TOO BUT YOU ARE HERE BELOVED ONE AND I WILL NOT SCOLD
8404-282926-0072 GO IN AND REST AND LET ME WATER YOUR HORSE AND STAKE HIM WITH THE LONG ROPE THERE IS COOL WATER IN THE JAR FOR YOU THE KID KISSED HER AFFECTIONATELY NOT IF THE COURT KNOWS ITSELF DO I LET A LADY STAKE MY HORSE FOR ME SAID HE BUT IF YOU'LL RUN IN CHICA
8404-282926-0073 I'LL BE A GOOD DEAL OBLIGED BESIDES HIS MARKSMANSHIP THE KID HAD ANOTHER ATTRIBUTE FOR WHICH HE ADMIRED HIMSELF GREATLY HE WAS MUY CABALLERO AS THE MEXICANS EXPRESS IT WHERE THE LADIES WERE CONCERNED
8404-282926-0074 FOR THEM HE HAD ALWAYS GENTLE WORDS AND CONSIDERATION HE COULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN A HARSH WORD TO A WOMAN HE MIGHT RUTHLESSLY SLAY THEIR HUSBANDS AND BROTHERS BUT HE COULD NOT HAVE LAID THE WEIGHT OF A FINGER IN ANGER UPON A WOMAN WHEREFORE
8404-282926-0075 MANY OF THAT INTERESTING DIVISION OF HUMANITY WHO HAD COME UNDER THE SPELL OF HIS POLITENESS DECLARED THEIR DISBELIEF IN THE STORIES CIRCULATED ABOUT MISTER KID ONE SHOULDN'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING ONE HEARD THEY SAID
8404-282926-0076 WHEN CONFRONTED BY THEIR INDIGNANT MEN FOLK WITH PROOF OF THE CABALLERO'S DEEDS OF INFAMY THEY SAID MAYBE HE HAD BEEN DRIVEN TO IT AND THAT HE KNEW HOW TO TREAT A LADY ANYHOW CONSIDERING THIS EXTREMELY COURTEOUS IDIOSYNCRASY OF THE KID
8404-282926-0077 AND THE PRIDE HE TOOK IN IT ONE CAN PERCEIVE THAT THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM THAT WAS PRESENTED TO HIM BY WHAT HE SAW AND HEARD FROM HIS HIDING PLACE IN THE PEAR THAT AFTERNOON AT LEAST AS TO ONE OF THE ACTORS MUST HAVE BEEN OBSCURED BY DIFFICULTIES
8404-282926-0078 AND YET ONE COULD NOT THINK OF THE KID OVERLOOKING LITTLE MATTERS OF THAT KIND
8404-282926-0079 GOAT STEAKS CANNED PEACHES AND COFFEE BY THE LIGHT OF A LANTERN IN THE JACAL AFTERWARD THE ANCESTOR HIS FLOCK CORRALLED SMOKED A CIGARETTE AND BECAME A MUMMY IN A GREY BLANKET TONIA WASHED THE FEW DISHES
8404-282926-0080 WHILE THE KID DRIED THEM WITH THE FLOUR SACKING TOWEL HER EYES SHONE SHE CHATTED VOLUBLY OF THE INCONSEQUENT HAPPENINGS OF HER SMALL WORLD SINCE THE KID'S LAST VISIT IT WAS AS ALL HIS OTHER HOME COMINGS HAD BEEN THEN OUTSIDE TONIA SWUNG IN A GRASS HAMMOCK WITH HER GUITAR
8404-282926-0081 DO YOU LOVE ME JUST THE SAME OLD GIRL ASKED THE KID HUNTING FOR HIS CIGARETTE PAPERS ALWAYS THE SAME LITTLE ONE SAID TONIA HER DARK EYES LINGERING UPON HIM I MUST GO OVER TO FINK'S SAID THE KID RISING FOR SOME TOBACCO
8404-282926-0082 I THOUGHT I HAD ANOTHER SACK IN MY COAT I'LL BE BACK IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HASTEN SAID TONIA AND TELL ME HOW LONG SHALL I CALL YOU MY OWN THIS TIME WILL YOU BE GONE AGAIN TO MORROW LEAVING ME TO GRIEVE
8404-282926-0083 OR WILL YOU BE LONGER WITH YOUR TONIA OH I MIGHT STAY TWO OR THREE DAYS THIS TRIP SAID THE KID YAWNING I'VE BEEN ON THE DODGE FOR A MONTH AND I'D LIKE TO REST UP HE WAS GONE HALF AN HOUR FOR HIS TOBACCO
8404-282926-0084 WHEN HE RETURNED TONIA WAS STILL LYING IN THE HAMMOCK IT'S FUNNY SAID THE KID HOW I FEEL I FEEL LIKE THERE WAS SOMEBODY LYING BEHIND EVERY BUSH AND TREE WAITING TO SHOOT ME I NEVER HAD MULLYGRUBS LIKE THEM BEFORE
8404-282926-0085 MAYBE IT'S ONE OF THEM PRESUMPTIONS I'VE GOT HALF A NOTION TO LIGHT OUT IN THE MORNING BEFORE DAY THE GUADALUPE COUNTRY IS BURNING UP ABOUT THAT OLD DUTCHMAN I PLUGGED DOWN THERE YOU ARE NOT AFRAID NO ONE COULD MAKE MY BRAVE LITTLE ONE FEAR
8404-282926-0086 WELL I HAVEN'T BEEN USUALLY REGARDED AS A JACK RABBIT WHEN IT COMES TO SCRAPPING BUT I DON'T WANT A POSSE SMOKING ME OUT WHEN I'M IN YOUR JACAL SOMEBODY MIGHT GET HURT THAT OUGHTN'T TO REMAIN WITH YOUR TONIA NO ONE WILL FIND YOU HERE
8404-282926-0087 THE KID LOOKED KEENLY INTO THE SHADOWS UP AND DOWN THE ARROYO AND TOWARD THE DIM LIGHTS OF THE MEXICAN VILLAGE I'LL SEE HOW IT LOOKS LATER ON WAS HIS DECISION AT MIDNIGHT A HORSEMAN RODE INTO THE RANGERS CAMP
8404-282926-0088 BLAZING HIS WAY BY NOISY HALLOES TO INDICATE A PACIFIC MISSION SANDRIDGE AND ONE OR TWO OTHERS TURNED OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE ROW
8404-282926-0089 FROM THE LONE WOLF CROSSING HE BORE A LETTER FOR SENOR SANDRIDGE OLD LUISA THE LAVENDERA HAD PERSUADED HIM TO BRING IT HE SAID HER SON GREGORIO BEING TOO ILL OF A FEVER TO RIDE SANDRIDGE LIGHTED THE CAMP LANTERN AND READ THE LETTER
8404-282926-0090 THESE WERE ITS WORDS DEAR ONE HE HAS COME HARDLY HAD YOU RIDDEN AWAY WHEN HE CAME OUT OF THE PEAR WHEN HE FIRST TALKED HE SAID HE WOULD STAY THREE DAYS OR MORE THEN AS IT GREW LATER HE WAS LIKE A WOLF OR A FOX AND WALKED ABOUT WITHOUT REST
8404-282926-0091 LOOKING AND LISTENING SOON HE SAID HE MUST LEAVE BEFORE DAYLIGHT WHEN IT IS DARK AND STILLEST AND THEN HE SEEMED TO SUSPECT THAT I BE NOT TRUE TO HIM HE LOOKED AT ME SO STRANGE THAT I AM FRIGHTENED I SWEAR TO HIM THAT I LOVE HIM
8404-282926-0092 HIS OWN TONIA LAST OF ALL HE SAID I MUST PROVE TO HIM I AM TRUE HE THINKS THAT EVEN NOW MEN ARE WAITING TO KILL HIM AS HE RIDES FROM MY HOUSE TO ESCAPE HE SAYS HE WILL DRESS IN MY CLOTHES
8404-282926-0093 MY RED SKIRT AND THE BLUE WAIST I WEAR AND THE BROWN MANTILLA OVER THE HEAD AND THUS RIDE AWAY BUT BEFORE THAT HE SAYS THAT I MUST PUT ON HIS CLOTHES HIS PANTALONES AND CAMISA AND HAT
8404-282926-0094 AND RIDE AWAY ON HIS HORSE FROM THE JACAL AS FAR AS THE BIG ROAD BEYOND THE CROSSING AND BACK AGAIN THIS BEFORE HE GOES SO HE CAN TELL IF I AM TRUE AND IF MEN ARE HIDDEN TO SHOOT HIM IT IS A TERRIBLE THING AN HOUR BEFORE DAYBREAK THIS IS TO
8404-282926-0095 BE COME MY DEAR ONE AND KILL THIS MAN AND TAKE ME FOR YOUR TONIA
8404-282926-0096 KNOWING ALL YOU SHOULD DO THAT YOU MUST COME LONG BEFORE THE TIME AND HIDE YOURSELF IN THE LITTLE SHED
8404-282926-0097 IT IS DARK IN THERE HE WILL WEAR MY RED SKIRT AND BLUE WAIST AND BROWN MANTILLA I SEND YOU A HUNDRED KISSES COME SURELY AND SHOOT QUICKLY AND STRAIGHT THINE OWN TONIA
8404-282926-0098 SANDRIDGE QUICKLY EXPLAINED TO HIS MEN THE OFFICIAL PART OF THE MISSIVE THE RANGERS PROTESTED AGAINST HIS GOING ALONE I'LL GET HIM EASY ENOUGH SAID THE LIEUTENANT THE GIRL'S GOT HIM TRAPPED AND DON'T EVEN THINK HE'LL GET THE DROP ON ME
8404-282926-0099 SANDRIDGE SADDLED HIS HORSE AND RODE TO THE LONE WOLF CROSSING HE TIED HIS BIG DUN IN A CLUMP OF BRUSH ON THE ARROYO TOOK HIS WINCHESTER FROM ITS SCABBARD AND CAREFULLY APPROACHED THE PEREZ JACAL
8404-282926-0100 THERE WAS ONLY THE HALF OF A HIGH MOON DRIFTED OVER BY RAGGED MILK WHITE GULF CLOUDS THE WAGON SHED WAS AN EXCELLENT PLACE FOR AMBUSH AND THE RANGER GOT INSIDE IT SAFELY
8404-282926-0101 HE COULD SEE A HORSE TIED AND HEAR HIM IMPATIENTLY PAWING THE HARD TRODDEN EARTH HE WAITED ALMOST AN HOUR BEFORE TWO FIGURES CAME OUT OF THE JACAL
8404-282926-0102 TOWARD THE CROSSING AND VILLAGE AND THEN THE OTHER FIGURE IN SKIRT WAIST AND MANTILLA OVER ITS HEAD STEPPED OUT INTO THE FAINT MOONLIGHT GAZING AFTER THE RIDER SANDRIDGE THOUGHT HE WOULD TAKE HIS CHANCE THEN BEFORE TONIA RODE BACK
8404-282926-0103 HE FANCIED SHE MIGHT NOT CARE TO SEE IT THROW UP YOUR HANDS HE ORDERED LOUDLY STEPPING OUT OF THE WAGON SHED WITH HIS WINCHESTER AT HIS SHOULDER THERE WAS A QUICK TURN OF THE FIGURE BUT NO MOVEMENT TO OBEY SO THE RANGER PUMPED IN THE BULLETS
8404-282926-0104 ONE TWO THREE AND THEN TWICE MORE FOR YOU NEVER COULD BE TOO SURE OF BRINGING DOWN THE CISCO KID THERE WAS NO DANGER OF MISSING AT TEN PACES EVEN IN THAT HALF MOONLIGHT THE OLD ANCESTOR ASLEEP ON HIS BLANKET
8404-282926-0105 WAS AWAKENED BY THE SHOTS LISTENING FURTHER HE HEARD A GREAT CRY FROM SOME MAN IN MORTAL DISTRESS OR ANGUISH AND ROSE UP GRUMBLING AT THE DISTURBING WAYS OF MODERNS
8404-282926-0106 FOR THE LANTERN HANGING ON ITS NAIL THE OTHER SPREAD A LETTER ON THE TABLE
8404-282926-0107 AH DIOS IT IS SENOR SANDRIDGE MUMBLED THE OLD MAN APPROACHING
8404-282926-0108 THAT LETTER WAS WRITTEN BY EL CHIVATO AS HE IS CALLED BY THE MAN OF TONIA THEY SAY HE IS A BAD MAN I DO NOT KNOW
8404-282926-0109 I AM VERY OLD AND I DID NOT KNOW
8404-282926-0110 IT IS A VERY FOOLISH WORLD AND THERE IS NOTHING IN THE HOUSE TO DRINK NOTHING TO DRINK JUST THEN ALL THAT SANDRIDGE COULD THINK OF TO DO WAS TO GO OUTSIDE AND THROW HIMSELF FACE DOWNWARD IN THE DUST BY THE SIDE OF HIS HUMMING BIRD
8404-282926-0111 OF WHOM NOT A FEATHER FLUTTERED HE WAS NOT A CABALLERO BY INSTINCT AND HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE NICETIES OF REVENGE
