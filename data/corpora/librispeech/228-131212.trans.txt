228-131212-0000 THE NEXT MORNING DIAMOND WAS UP ALMOST AS EARLY AS BEFORE HE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR FROM HIS MOTHER NOW AND MADE NO SECRET OF WHAT HE WAS ABOUT BY THE TIME HE REACHED THE STABLE SEVERAL OF THE MEN WERE THERE
228-131212-0001 AND HE TOLD THEM ALL THEY WANTED TO KNOW BUT WHEN HE PROCEEDED TO HARNESS THE OLD HORSE THEY PUSHED HIM ASIDE WITH ROUGH KINDNESS CALLED HIM A BABY AND BEGAN TO DO IT ALL FOR HIM
228-131212-0002 SO DIAMOND RAN IN AND HAD ANOTHER MOUTHFUL OF TEA AND BREAD AND BUTTER AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO TIRED AS HE WAS THE NIGHT BEFORE HE STARTED QUITE FRESH THIS MORNING IT WAS A CLOUDY DAY AND THE WIND BLEW HARD FROM THE NORTH
228-131212-0003 SO HARD SOMETIMES THAT PERCHED ON THE BOX WITH JUST HIS TOES TOUCHING THE GROUND
228-131212-0004 LEST HE SHOULD BE BLOWN AWAY BUT HE DID NOT REALLY MIND IT HIS HEAD WAS FULL OF THE DREAM HE HAD DREAMED
228-131212-0005 FOR HIS WORK WAS NOT TO DIG STARS BUT TO DRIVE OLD DIAMOND AND PICK UP FARES THERE ARE NOT MANY PEOPLE WHO CAN THINK ABOUT BEAUTIFUL THINGS AND DO COMMON WORK AT THE SAME TIME BUT THEN THERE ARE NOT MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TO THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND
228-131212-0006 THERE WAS NOT MUCH BUSINESS DOING AND DIAMOND FELT RATHER COLD NOTWITHSTANDING HIS MOTHER HAD HERSELF PUT ON HIS COMFORTER AND HELPED HIM WITH HIS GREATCOAT BUT HE WAS TOO WELL AWARE OF HIS DIGNITY TO GET INSIDE HIS CAB AS SOME DO
228-131212-0007 A CABMAN OUGHT TO BE ABOVE MINDING THE WEATHER AT LEAST SO DIAMOND THOUGHT AT LENGTH HE WAS CALLED TO A NEIGHBOURING HOUSE
228-131212-0008 FOR THE ROUGHS WERE IN GREAT FORCE HOWEVER THERE BEING NO BLOCK NOT EVEN IN NIGHTINGALE LANE HE REACHED THE ENTRANCE OF THE WHARF AND SET DOWN HIS PASSENGER WITHOUT ANNOYANCE
228-131212-0009 BUT AS HE TURNED TO GO BACK SOME IDLERS NOT CONTENT WITH CHAFFING HIM SHOWED A MIND TO THE FARE THE YOUNG WOMAN HAD GIVEN HIM THEY WERE JUST PULLING HIM OFF THE BOX AND DIAMOND WAS SHOUTING FOR THE POLICE WHEN A PALE FACED MAN
228-131212-0010 CAME UP AND MAKING GOOD USE OF HIS STICK DROVE THEM OFF NOW MY LITTLE MAN HE SAID GET ON WHILE YOU CAN
228-131212-0011 BUT DIAMOND WAS NOT IN THE HABIT OF THINKING ONLY OF HIMSELF HE SAW THAT HIS NEW FRIEND LOOKED WEARY IF NOT ILL AND VERY POOR WON'T YOU JUMP IN SIR HE SAID I WILL TAKE YOU WHEREVER YOU LIKE
228-131212-0012 THANK YOU MY MAN BUT I HAVE NO MONEY SO I CAN'T OH I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY I SHALL BE MUCH HAPPIER IF YOU WILL GET IN YOU HAVE SAVED ME ALL I HAD I OWE YOU A LIFT SIR
228-131212-0013 WHICH WAY ARE YOU GOING TO CHARING CROSS BUT I DON'T MIND WHERE I GO WELL I AM VERY TIRED IF YOU WILL TAKE ME TO CHARING CROSS I SHALL BE GREATLY OBLIGED TO YOU I HAVE WALKED FROM GRAVESEND
228-131212-0014 SO SAYING HE OPENED THE DOOR AND GOT IN AND DIAMOND DROVE AWAY BUT AS HE DROVE HE COULD NOT HELP FANCYING HE HAD SEEN THE GENTLEMAN FOR DIAMOND KNEW HE WAS A GENTLEMAN BEFORE
228-131212-0015 DO ALL HE COULD HOWEVER HE COULD NOT RECALL WHERE OR WHEN
228-131212-0016 WHOM THE RELIEF OF BEING CARRIED HAD MADE LESS AND LESS INCLINED TO CARRY HIMSELF HAD BEEN TURNING OVER THINGS IN HIS MIND AND AS THEY PASSED THE MINT CALLED TO DIAMOND
228-131212-0017 IF YOU DIDN'T MIND TAKING ME TO CHISWICK I SHOULD BE ABLE TO PAY YOU WHEN WE GOT THERE IT'S A LONG WAY BUT YOU SHALL HAVE THE WHOLE FARE FROM THE DOCKS AND SOMETHING OVER VERY WELL SIR SAID DIAMOND I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY
228-131212-0018 HE WAS JUST CLAMBERING UP AGAIN WHEN THE GENTLEMAN PUT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAID IT'S THE WILDERNESS MISTER COLEMAN'S PLACE BUT I'LL DIRECT YOU WHEN WE COME INTO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT FLASHED UPON DIAMOND WHO HE WAS
228-131212-0019 BUT HE GOT UPON HIS BOX TO ARRANGE HIS THOUGHTS BEFORE MAKING ANY REPLY THE GENTLEMAN WAS MISTER EVANS TO WHOM MISS COLEMAN WAS TO HAVE BEEN MARRIED
228-131212-0020 I HAVE SAID THAT HE HAD NOT BEHAVED VERY WELL TO MISS COLEMAN HE HAD PUT OFF THEIR MARRIAGE MORE THAN ONCE IN A COWARDLY FASHION
228-131212-0021 WHEN A MAN THINKS OF WHAT PEOPLE WILL SAY IN SUCH A CASE HE MAY LOVE BUT HIS LOVE IS BUT A POOR AFFAIR MISTER COLEMAN TOOK HIM INTO THE FIRM AS A JUNIOR PARTNER
228-131212-0022 AND IT WAS IN A MEASURE THROUGH HIS INFLUENCE THAT HE ENTERED UPON THOSE SPECULATIONS WHICH RUINED HIM SO HIS LOVE HAD NOT BEEN A BLESSING THE SHIP WHICH NORTH WIND HAD SUNK WAS THEIR LAST VENTURE
228-131212-0023 AND MISTER EVANS HAD GONE OUT WITH IT IN THE HOPE OF TURNING ITS CARGO TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE HE WAS ONE OF THE SINGLE BOAT LOAD WHICH MANAGED TO REACH A DESERT ISLAND
228-131212-0024 BUT HE WAS NOT PAST BEING TAUGHT AND HIS TROUBLES HAD DONE HIM NO END OF GOOD FOR THEY HAD MADE HIM DOUBT HIMSELF
228-131212-0025 AND HUNT FOR HER FOOD AND MAKE CLOTHES FOR HER HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIMSELF THE MOST FORTUNATE OF MEN
228-131212-0026 IN WHICH CASE IT IS THE ONE FRIGHTFUL THING TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO HE HAD COME BACK A MORE HUMBLE MAN AND LONGING TO ASK MISS COLEMAN TO FORGIVE HIM BUT HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT RUIN HAD FALLEN UPON THEM
228-131212-0027 FOR HE HAD NEVER MADE HIMSELF THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE FIRM'S AFFAIRS FEW SPECULATIVE PEOPLE DO KNOW THEIR OWN AFFAIRS HENCE HE NEVER DOUBTED HE SHOULD FIND MATTERS MUCH AS HE LEFT THEM
228-131212-0028 BUT IF HE HAD NOT FALLEN IN WITH DIAMOND HE WOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF GOING THERE FIRST WHAT WAS DIAMOND TO DO HE HAD HEARD HIS FATHER AND MOTHER DROP SOME REMARKS CONCERNING MISTER EVANS WHICH MADE HIM DOUBTFUL OF HIM
228-131212-0029 IT WAS OF COURSE OF NO USE TO DRIVE MISTER EVANS TO CHISWICK BUT IF HE SHOULD TELL HIM WHAT HAD BEFALLEN THEM AND WHERE THEY LIVED NOW HE MIGHT PUT OFF GOING TO SEE THEM AND HE WAS CERTAIN THAT MISS COLEMAN AT LEAST MUST WANT VERY MUCH TO SEE MISTER EVANS
228-131212-0030 THE MOMENT HE CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION HE CHANGED HIS COURSE FROM WESTWARD TO NORTHWARD AND WENT STRAIGHT FOR MISTER COLEMAN'S POOR LITTLE HOUSE IN HOXTON
228-131212-0031 AND HAD NO SUSPICION THEREFORE OF THE CHANGE OF DIRECTION BY THIS TIME THE WIND HAD INCREASED ALMOST TO A HURRICANE AND AS THEY HAD OFTEN TO HEAD IT IT WAS NO JOKE FOR EITHER OF THE DIAMONDS THE DISTANCE HOWEVER WAS NOT GREAT
228-131212-0032 BEFORE THEY REACHED THE STREET WHERE MISTER COLEMAN LIVED IT BLEW SO TREMENDOUSLY THAT WHEN MISS COLEMAN WHO WAS GOING OUT A LITTLE WAY OPENED THE DOOR IT DASHED AGAINST THE WALL WITH SUCH A BANG THAT SHE WAS AFRAID TO VENTURE AND WENT IN AGAIN
228-131212-0033 OLD DIAMOND HAD SO MUCH ADO TO STOP THE CAB AGAINST IT
228-131212-0034 YOUNG DIAMOND JUMPED OFF HIS BOX
228-131212-0035 THEN TURNED TO THE CAB AND SAID BEFORE MISTER EVANS HAD QUITE BEGUN TO THINK SOMETHING MUST BE AMISS PLEASE SIR MY HARNESS HAS GIVEN AWAY WOULD YOU MIND STEPPING IN HERE FOR A FEW MINUTES THEY'RE FRIENDS OF MINE I'LL TAKE YOU WHERE YOU LIKE AFTER I'VE GOT IT MENDED
228-131212-0036 HALF STUPID WITH FATIGUE AND WANT OF FOOD MISTER EVANS YIELDED TO THE BOY'S SUGGESTION AND WALKED IN AT THE DOOR WHICH THE MAID HELD WITH DIFFICULTY AGAINST THE WIND SHE TOOK MISTER EVANS FOR A VISITOR AS INDEED HE WAS
228-131212-0037 AND SHOWED HIM INTO THE ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR
228-131212-0038 TELL MISS COLEMAN IT'S MISS COLEMAN HE WANTS TO SEE I DON'T KNOW SAID THE MAID HE DON'T LOOK MUCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN HE IS THOUGH AND I KNOW HIM AND SO DOES MISS COLEMAN
228-131212-0039 THE MAID COULD NOT BUT REMEMBER DIAMOND HAVING SEEN HIM WHEN HE AND HIS FATHER BROUGHT THE LADIES HOME SO SHE BELIEVED HIM
228-131212-0040 WHICH IS ALL ABOUT DIAMOND IF HE HAD KNOWN THAT MISS COLEMAN THOUGHT MISTER EVANS WAS DEAD PERHAPS HE WOULD HAVE MANAGED DIFFERENTLY THERE WAS A CRY AND A RUNNING TO AND FRO IN THE HOUSE
228-131212-0041 ALMOST AS SOON AS MISTER EVANS WENT IN THE WIND BEGAN TO CEASE AND WAS NOW STILL DIAMOND FOUND THAT BY MAKING THE BREECHING JUST A LITTLE TIGHTER THAN WAS QUITE COMFORTABLE FOR THE OLD HORSE HE COULD DO VERY WELL FOR THE PRESENT
228-131212-0042 AND THINKING IT BETTER TO LET HIM HAVE HIS BAG IN THIS QUIET PLACE
228-131212-0043 IN A LITTLE WHILE MISTER EVANS CAME OUT AND ASKED HIM TO COME IN DIAMOND OBEYED AND TO HIS DELIGHT MISS COLEMAN PUT HER ARMS ROUND HIM AND KISSED HIM AND THERE WAS PAYMENT FOR HIM NOT TO MENTION THE FIVE PRECIOUS SHILLINGS SHE GAVE HIM
228-131212-0044 WHICH HE COULD NOT REFUSE BECAUSE HIS MOTHER WANTED THEM SO MUCH AT HOME FOR HIS FATHER HE LEFT THEM NEARLY AS HAPPY AS THEY WERE THEMSELVES THE REST OF THE DAY HE DID BETTER AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT SO MUCH TO TAKE HOME AS THE DAY BEFORE
228-131212-0045 AND HOW HE HAD DONE AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT THEY ASKED HIM SUCH A MULTITUDE OF QUESTIONS SOME OF WHICH HE COULD ANSWER AND SOME OF WHICH HE COULD NOT ANSWER AND HIS FATHER SEEMED EVER SO MUCH BETTER FROM FINDING THAT HIS BOY WAS ALREADY NOT ONLY USEFUL TO HIS FAMILY BUT USEFUL TO OTHER PEOPLE
228-131212-0046 AND DID WORK WORTH DOING FOR A FORTNIGHT DIAMOND WENT ON DRIVING HIS CAB AND KEEPING HIS FAMILY HE HAD BEGUN TO BE KNOWN ABOUT SOME PARTS OF LONDON
228-131212-0047 ONE GENTLEMAN WHO LIVED NEAR THE MEWS ENGAGED HIM TO CARRY HIM TO THE CITY EVERY MORNING AT A CERTAIN HOUR AND DIAMOND WAS PUNCTUAL AS CLOCKWORK THOUGH TO EFFECT THAT REQUIRED A GOOD DEAL OF CARE FOR HIS FATHER'S WATCH WAS NOT MUCH TO BE DEPENDED ON
228-131212-0048 BETWEEN THE TWO HOWEVER HE DID MAKE A SUCCESS OF IT AFTER THAT FORTNIGHT HIS FATHER WAS ABLE TO GO OUT AGAIN
