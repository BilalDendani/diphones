517-121739-0000 I CANNOT TELL ANY BETTER THAN MOST OF MY READERS HOW AND WHEN I BEGAN TO COME AWAKE OR WHAT IT WAS THAT WAKENED ME I MEAN I CANNOT REMEMBER WHEN I BEGAN TO REMEMBER OR WHAT FIRST GOT SET DOWN IN MY MEMORY AS WORTH REMEMBERING
517-121739-0001 SOMETIMES I FANCY IT MUST HAVE BEEN A TREMENDOUS FLOOD THAT FIRST MADE ME WONDER AND SO MADE ME BEGIN TO REMEMBER AT ALL EVENTS I DO REMEMBER ONE FLOOD THAT SEEMS ABOUT AS FAR OFF AS ANYTHING
517-121739-0002 THE RAIN POURING SO THICK THAT I PUT OUT MY HAND IN FRONT OF ME TO TRY WHETHER I COULD SEE IT THROUGH THE VEIL OF THE FALLING WATER THE RIVER WHICH IN GENERAL WAS TO BE SEEN ONLY IN GLIMPSES FROM THE HOUSE FOR IT RAN AT THE BOTTOM OF A HOLLOW
517-121739-0003 WAS OUTSPREAD LIKE A SEA IN FRONT AND STRETCHED AWAY FAR ON EITHER HAND IT WAS A LITTLE STREAM BUT IT FILLS SO MUCH OF MY MEMORY WITH ITS REGULAR RECURRENCE OF AUTUMNAL FLOODS
517-121739-0004 THAT I CAN HAVE NO CONFIDENCE THAT ONE OF THESE IS IN REALITY THE OLDEST THING I REMEMBER INDEED I HAVE A SUSPICION THAT MY OLDEST MEMORIES ARE OF DREAMS WHERE OR WHEN DREAMED THE GOOD ONE WHO MADE ME ONLY KNOWS THEY ARE VERY VAGUE TO ME NOW
517-121739-0005 ONE ONLY I CAN RECALL AND IT I WILL RELATE OR MORE PROPERLY DESCRIBE FOR THERE WAS HARDLY ANYTHING DONE IN IT I DREAMED IT OFTEN IT WAS OF THE ROOM I SLEPT IN ONLY IT WAS NARROWER IN THE DREAM AND LOFTIER
517-121739-0006 AND THE WINDOW WAS GONE BUT THE CEILING WAS A CEILING INDEED FOR THE SUN MOON AND STARS LIVED THERE THE SUN WAS NOT A SCIENTIFIC SUN AT ALL
517-121739-0007 BUT ONE SUCH AS YOU SEE IN PENNY PICTURE BOOKS A ROUND JOLLY JOCUND MAN'S FACE WITH FLASHES OF YELLOW FRILLING IT ALL ABOUT JUST WHAT A GRAND SUNFLOWER WOULD LOOK IF YOU SET A COUNTENANCE WHERE THE BLACK SEEDS ARE
517-121739-0008 AND THE MOON WAS JUST SUCH A ONE AS YOU MAY SEE THE COW JUMPING OVER IN THE PICTURED NURSERY RHYME SHE WAS A CRESCENT OF COURSE THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE A FACE DRAWN IN THE HOLLOW
517-121739-0009 WHO SEEMED TO BE HER HUSBAND HE LOOKED MERRILY AT HER AND SHE LOOKED TRUSTFULLY AT HIM AND I KNEW THAT THEY GOT ON VERY WELL TOGETHER THE STARS WERE THEIR CHILDREN OF COURSE AND THEY SEEMED TO RUN ABOUT THE CEILING JUST AS THEY PLEASED
517-121739-0010 BUT THE SUN AND THE MOON HAD REGULAR MOTIONS ROSE AND SET AT THE PROPER TIMES FOR THEY WERE STEADY OLD FOLKS I DO NOT HOWEVER REMEMBER EVER SEEING THEM RISE OR SET THEY WERE ALWAYS UP AND NEAR THE CENTRE BEFORE THE DREAM DAWNED ON ME
517-121739-0011 IT WOULD ALWAYS COME IN ONE WAY I THOUGHT I AWOKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND LO THERE WAS THE ROOM WITH THE SUN AND THE MOON AND THE STARS AT THEIR PRANKS AND REVELS IN THE CEILING MISTER SUN NODDING AND SMILING ACROSS THE INTERVENING SPACE TO MISSUS MOON
517-121739-0012 AND SHE NODDING BACK TO HIM WITH A KNOWING LOOK AND THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH DRAWN DOWN I HAVE VAGUE MEMORIES OF HAVING HEARD THEM TALK AT TIMES I FEEL AS IF I COULD YET RECALL SOMETHING OF WHAT THEY SAID BUT IT VANISHES THE MOMENT I TRY TO CATCH IT
517-121739-0013 IT WAS VERY QUEER TALK INDEED ABOUT ME I FANCIED BUT A THREAD OF STRONG SENSE RAN THROUGH IT ALL WHEN THE DREAM HAD BEEN VERY VIVID I WOULD SOMETIMES THINK OF IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NEXT DAY AND LOOK UP TO THE SUN SAYING TO MYSELF
517-121739-0014 HE'S UP THERE NOW BUSY ENOUGH I WONDER WHAT HE IS SEEING TO TALK TO HIS WIFE ABOUT WHEN HE COMES DOWN AT NIGHT I THINK IT SOMETIMES MADE ME A LITTLE MORE CAREFUL OF MY CONDUCT WHEN THE SUN SET I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING IN THE BACK WAY AND WHEN THE MOON ROSE
517-121739-0015 WHEN THEY MIGHT COME AND TALK ABOUT ME AGAIN IT WAS ODD THAT ALTHOUGH I NEVER FANCIED IT OF THE SUN I THOUGHT I COULD MAKE THE MOON FOLLOW ME AS I PLEASED I REMEMBER ONCE MY ELDEST BROTHER GIVING ME GREAT OFFENCE BY BURSTING INTO LAUGHTER
517-121739-0016 WHEN I OFFERED IN ALL SERIOUSNESS TO BRING HER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE
517-121739-0017 BUT I MUST RETURN TO MY DREAM FOR THE MOST REMARKABLE THING IN IT I HAVE NOT YET TOLD YOU IN ONE CORNER OF THE CEILING THERE WAS A HOLE AND THROUGH THAT HOLE CAME DOWN A LADDER OF SUN RAYS VERY BRIGHT AND LOVELY
517-121739-0018 WHERE IT CAME FROM I NEVER THOUGHT BUT OF COURSE IT COULD NOT COME FROM THE SUN BECAUSE THERE HE WAS WITH HIS BRIGHT COAT OFF PLAYING THE FATHER OF HIS FAMILY IN THE MOST HOMELY OLD ENGLISH GENTLEMAN FASHION POSSIBLE
517-121739-0019 THAT IT WAS A LADDER OF RAYS THERE COULD HOWEVER BE NO DOUBT IF ONLY I COULD CLIMB UPON IT I OFTEN TRIED BUT FAST AS I LIFTED MY FEET TO CLIMB DOWN THEY CAME AGAIN UPON THE BOARDS OF THE FLOOR
517-121739-0020 AT LENGTH I DID SUCCEED BUT THIS TIME
517-121739-0021 BUT AT THIS TIME WE WERE FIVE THERE WAS A LITTLE BABY HE WAS VERY ILL HOWEVER AND I KNEW HE WAS NOT EXPECTED TO LIVE I REMEMBER LOOKING OUT OF MY BED ONE NIGHT AND SEEING MY MOTHER BENDING OVER HIM IN HER LAP
517-121739-0022 IT IS ONE OF THE FEW THINGS IN WHICH I DO REMEMBER MY MOTHER I FELL ASLEEP BUT BY AND BY WOKE AND LOOKED OUT AGAIN NO ONE WAS THERE NOT ONLY WERE MOTHER AND BABY GONE BUT THE CRADLE WAS GONE TOO I KNEW THAT MY LITTLE BROTHER WAS DEAD
517-121739-0023 I DID NOT CRY I WAS TOO YOUNG AND IGNORANT TO CRY ABOUT IT I WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN AND SEEMED TO WAKE ONCE MORE BUT IT WAS INTO MY DREAM THIS TIME THERE WERE THE SUN AND THE MOON AND THE STARS BUT THE SUN AND THE MOON HAD GOT CLOSE TOGETHER
517-121739-0024 AND WERE TALKING VERY EARNESTLY AND ALL THE STARS HAD GATHERED ROUND THEM I COULD NOT HEAR A WORD THEY SAID BUT I CONCLUDED THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT MY LITTLE BROTHER I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO BE SORRY I SAID TO MYSELF AND I TRIED HARD BUT I COULD NOT FEEL SORRY
517-121739-0025 MEANTIME I OBSERVED A CURIOUS MOTION IN THE HEAVENLY HOST THEY KEPT LOOKING AT ME AND THEN AT THE CORNER WHERE THE LADDER STOOD AND TALKING ON FOR I SAW THEIR LIPS MOVING VERY FAST AND I THOUGHT BY THE MOTION OF THEM THAT THEY WERE SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT THE LADDER
517-121739-0026 I GOT OUT OF BED AND WENT TO IT
517-121739-0027 I WOULD TRY ONCE MORE TO MY DELIGHT I FOUND IT WOULD BEAR ME I CLIMBED AND CLIMBED AND THE SUN AND THE MOON AND THE STARS LOOKED MORE AND MORE PLEASED AS I GOT UP NEARER TO THEM TILL AT LAST THE SUN'S FACE WAS IN A BROAD SMILE
517-121739-0028 BUT THEY DID NOT MOVE FROM THEIR PLACES AND MY HEAD ROSE ABOVE THEM AND GOT OUT AT THE HOLE WHERE THE LADDER CAME IN WHAT I SAW THERE I CANNOT TELL I ONLY KNOW THAT A WIND SUCH AS HAD NEVER BLOWN UPON ME IN MY WAKING HOURS BLEW UPON ME NOW
517-121739-0029 I DID NOT CARE MUCH FOR KISSES THEN FOR I HAD NOT LEARNED HOW GOOD THEY ARE BUT SOMEHOW I FANCIED AFTERWARDS THAT THE WIND WAS MADE OF MY BABY BROTHER'S KISSES AND I BEGAN TO LOVE THE LITTLE MAN WHO HAD LIVED ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO BE OUR BROTHER
517-121739-0030 AND GET UP ABOVE THE SUN AND THE MOON AND THE STARS BY THE LADDER OF SUN RAYS BUT THIS I SAY I THOUGHT AFTERWARDS
517-121739-0031 AND THAT I FELL DOWN THE LADDER INTO THE ROOM AGAIN AND AWOKE AS ONE ALWAYS DOES WITH A FALL IN A DREAM SUN MOON AND STARS WERE GONE THE LADDER OF LIGHT HAD VANISHED AND I LAY SOBBING ON MY PILLOW
517-121739-0032 I HAVE TAKEN UP A GREAT DEAL OF ROOM WITH THIS STORY OF A DREAM BUT IT CLUNG TO ME AND WOULD OFTEN RETURN AND THEN THE TIME OF LIFE TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER REFERS IS ALL SO LIKE ONE THAT A DREAM COMES IN WELL ENOUGH IN IT
517-121739-0033 THERE IS A TWILIGHT OF THE MIND WHEN ALL THINGS ARE STRANGE AND WHEN THE MEMORY IS ONLY BEGINNING TO KNOW THAT IT HAS GOT A NOTEBOOK AND MUST PUT THINGS DOWN IN IT IT WAS NOT LONG AFTER THIS BEFORE MY MOTHER DIED AND I WAS SORRIER FOR MY FATHER THAN FOR MYSELF
517-121739-0034 HE LOOKED SO SAD I HAVE SAID THAT AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER SHE WAS AN INVALID HENCE SHE WAS UNABLE TO BE MUCH WITH US SHE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL IN MY MEMORY BUT DURING THE LAST MONTHS OF HER LIFE WE SELDOM SAW HER
517-121739-0035 AND THE DESIRE TO KEEP THE HOUSE QUIET FOR HER SAKE MUST HAVE BEEN THE BEGINNING OF THAT FREEDOM WHICH WE ENJOYED DURING THE WHOLE OF OUR BOYHOOD SO WE WERE OUT EVERY DAY AND ALL DAY LONG FINDING OUR MEALS WHEN WE PLEASED AND THAT AS I SHALL EXPLAIN
517-121739-0036 WITHOUT GOING HOME FOR THEM I REMEMBER HER DEATH CLEARLY BUT I WILL NOT DWELL UPON THAT IT IS TOO SAD TO WRITE MUCH ABOUT THOUGH SHE WAS HAPPY AND THE LEAST TROUBLED OF US ALL HER SOLE CONCERN WAS AT LEAVING HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN
517-121739-0037 BUT THE WILL OF GOD WAS A BETTER THING TO HER THAN TO LIVE WITH THEM MY SORROW AT LEAST WAS SOON OVER FOR GOD MAKES CHILDREN SO THAT GRIEF CANNOT CLEAVE TO THEM THEY MUST NOT BEGIN LIFE WITH A BURDEN OF LOSS HE KNOWS IT IS ONLY FOR A TIME
517-121739-0038 WHEN I SEE MY MOTHER AGAIN SHE WILL NOT REPROACH ME THAT MY TEARS WERE SO SOON DRIED LITTLE ONE I THINK I HEAR HER SAYING
517-121739-0039 YOU WILL TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT SOME DAY YES AND WE SHALL TELL OUR MOTHERS SHALL WE NOT HOW SORRY WE ARE THAT WE EVER GAVE THEM ANY TROUBLE SOMETIMES WE WERE VERY NAUGHTY AND SOMETIMES WE DID NOT KNOW BETTER MY MOTHER WAS VERY GOOD
517-121739-0040 BUT I CANNOT REMEMBER A SINGLE ONE OF THE MANY KISSES SHE MUST HAVE GIVEN ME I REMEMBER HER HOLDING MY HEAD TO HER BOSOM WHEN SHE WAS DYING
