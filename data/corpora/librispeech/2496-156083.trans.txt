2496-156083-0000 THAT HE IS TO BE MARRIED IN A FEW DAYS TO ONE OF THE SHYEST WOMEN IN ENGLAND THAT MY BROTHER EXPLAINS HIS MEANING THIS SHY CREATURE HE SAYS IS ME AND HE ASSURES EVERY ONE
2496-156083-0001 THAT HIS YOUNGER SISTER IS VERY SOON TO BE MISTER SOLMES'S WIFE HE TELLS ME OF THE PATTERNS BESPOKEN WHICH MY MOTHER MENTIONED TO ME NOT ONE THING ESCAPES HIM THAT IS DONE OR SAID IN THIS HOUSE
2496-156083-0002 MY SISTER HE SAYS REPORTS THE SAME THINGS AND THAT WITH SUCH PARTICULAR AGGRAVATIONS OF INSULT UPON HIM THAT HE CANNOT BUT BE EXTREMELY PIQUED AS WELL AT THE MANNER
2496-156083-0003 AS FROM THE OCCASION AND EXPRESSES HIMSELF WITH GREAT VIOLENCE UPON IT HE KNOWS NOT HE SAYS WHAT MY RELATIONS INDUCEMENTS CAN BE TO PREFER SUCH A MAN AS SOLMES TO HIM
2496-156083-0004 IF ADVANTAGEOUS SETTLEMENTS BE THE MOTIVE SOLMES SHALL NOT OFFER WHAT HE WILL REFUSE TO COMPLY WITH AS TO HIS ESTATE AND FAMILY THE FIRST CANNOT BE EXCEPTED AGAINST AND FOR THE SECOND
