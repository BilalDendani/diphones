8422-283572-0000 CHAPTER FIVE JACK AND THE BEAN STALK'S FARM IT WAS QUITE AN ORDINARY LOOKING FARM YARD AND QUITE AN ORDINARY LOOKING COW BUT SHE STARED SO EARNESTLY UP AT DAVY
8422-283572-0001 THAT HE FELT POSITIVELY CERTAIN SHE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TO HIM EVERY CREATURE I MEET DOES HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY HE THOUGHT AS HE FELT ABOUT FOR THE WINDOW FASTENING AND I SHOULD REALLY LIKE TO HEAR A COW
8422-283572-0002 HE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT THE COW EXPECTING TO SEE HER LAUGHING AT HIS MISFORTUNE BUT SHE STOOD GAZING AT HIM WITH A VERY SERIOUS EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE SOLEMNLY CHEWING
8422-283572-0003 AND SLOWLY SWISHING HER TAIL FROM SIDE TO SIDE AS DAVY REALLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO BEGIN A CONVERSATION WITH A COW HE WAITED FOR HER TO SPEAK FIRST AND THERE WAS CONSEQUENTLY A LONG PAUSE
8422-283572-0004 PRESENTLY THE COW SAID IN A MELANCHOLY LOWING TONE OF VOICE THE OLD GRAY GOOSE IS DEAD I'M VERY SORRY SAID DAVY NOT KNOWING WHAT ELSE TO SAY
8422-283572-0005 SAID THE COW POSITIVELY AND WE'VE BURIED HER IN THE VEGETABLE GARDEN WE THOUGHT GOOSEBERRIES WOULD COME UP BUT
8422-283572-0006 THEY DIDN'T NOTHING CAME UP BUT FEATHERS THAT'S VERY CURIOUS SAID DAVY CURIOUS BUT COMFORTABLE REPLIED THE COW YOU SEE
8422-283572-0007 IT MAKES A FEATHER BED IN THE GARDEN THE PIG SLEEPS THERE AND CALLS IT HIS QUILL PEN
8422-283572-0008 PORCUPINE QUILLS

8422-283572-0012 BY THE WAY THAT'S THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT PRETTY ISN'T IT DAVY TURNED AND LOOKED UP AT THE HOUSE IT CERTAINLY WAS A VERY PRETTY HOUSE
8422-283572-0013 THEN YOU MUST BE THE COW WITH A CRUMPLED HORN IT'S NOT CRUMPLED SAID THE COW WITH GREAT DIGNITY THERE'S A SLIGHT CRIMP IN IT TO BE SURE
8422-283572-0014 BUT NOTHING THAT CAN PROPERLY BE CALLED A CRUMP THEN THE STORY WAS ALL WRONG ABOUT MY TOSSING THE DOG IT WAS THE CAT THAT ATE THE MALT HE WAS A MALTESE CAT AND HIS NAME WAS FLIPMEGILDER
8422-283572-0015 DID YOU TOSS HIM INQUIRED DAVY CERTAINLY NOT SAID THE COW INDIGNANTLY WHO EVER HEARD OF A COW TOSSING A CAT
8422-283572-0016 THE FACT IS I'VE NEVER HAD A FAIR CHANCE TO TOSS ANYTHING
8422-283572-0017 MOTHER HUBBARD NEVER PERMITTED ANY LIBERTIES TO BE TAKEN WITH HIM I'D DEARLY LOVE TO SEE MOTHER HUBBARD SAID DAVY EAGERLY WELL YOU CAN SAID THE COW INDIFFERENTLY
8422-283572-0018 MOTHER HUBBARD WAS THERE SITTING AT THE PIANO AND EVIDENTLY JUST PREPARING TO SING THE PIANO WAS VERY REMARKABLE AND DAVY COULD NOT REMEMBER EVER HAVING SEEN ONE LIKE IT BEFORE THE TOP OF IT WAS ARRANGED WITH SHELVES
8422-283572-0019 ON WHICH STOOD ALL THE KITCHEN CROCKERY AND IN THE UNDER PART OF IT AT ONE END WAS AN OVEN WITH GLASS DOORS THROUGH WHICH HE COULD SEE SEVERAL PIES BAKING MOTHER HUBBARD WAS DRESSED
8422-283572-0020 JUST AS HE EXPECTED IN A VERY ORNAMENTAL FLOWERED GOWN WITH HIGH HEELED SHOES AND BUCKLES AND WORE A TALL POINTED HAT OVER HER NIGHTCAP SHE WAS SO LIKE THE PICTURES DAVY HAD SEEN OF HER
8422-283572-0021 SHE SANG IN A HIGH KEY WITH A VERY QUAVERING VOICE AND THIS WAS THE SONG I HAD AN EDUCATED PUG HIS NAME WAS TOMMY JONES
8422-283572-0022 HE LIVED UPON THE PARLOR RUG EXCLUSIVELY ON BONES AND IF IN A SECLUDED ROOM
8422-283572-0023 TO JOIN HIM AT HIS TEA AND WHEN I WENT TO PAY A BILL I THINK IT WAS FOR
8422-283572-0024 NO SAID DAVY GREATLY SURPRISED AT THE QUESTION SO I SUPPOSED
8422-283572-0025 BUT I COULDN'T HELP THAT SAID DAVY OF COURSE YOU COULDN'T SAID THE COW YAWNING INDOLENTLY IT'S PRECISELY WHAT I SHOULD EXPECT OF A PERSON WHO HADN'T ANY CHEWING GUM
8422-283572-0026 AND WITH THIS THE COW WALKED GRAVELY AWAY JUST AS MOTHER HUBBARD MADE HER APPEARANCE AT THE WINDOW BOY SAID MOTHER HUBBARD BEAMING MILDLY UPON DAVY THROUGH HER SPECTACLES
8422-283572-0027 YOU SHOULDN'T THROW GRAVEL I HAVEN'T THROWN ANY SAID DAVY FIE SAID MOTHER HUBBARD SHAKING HER HEAD ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH I AM SPEAKING THE TRUTH SAID DAVY
8422-283572-0028 INDIGNANTLY IT WAS GOBOBBLES SO I SUPPOSED SAID MOTHER HUBBARD GENTLY SHAKING HER HEAD AGAIN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER IF HE HAD BEEN COOKED LAST CHRISTMAS INSTEAD OF BEING LEFT OVER
8422-283572-0029 STUFFING HIM AND THEN LETTING HIM GO HAS MADE A VERY PROUD CREATURE OF HIM YOU SHOULD NEVER BE PROUD I'M NOT PROUD REPLIED DAVY PROVOKED AT BEING MIXED UP WITH GOBOBBLES IN THIS WAY
8422-283572-0030 YOU MAY DEFINE THE WORD PROUD AND GIVE A FEW EXAMPLES CONTINUED MOTHER HUBBARD AND BY THIS TIME SHE HAD GROWN TO BE SO SURPRISINGLY LIKE MISS PEGGS THAT DAVY IMMEDIATELY CLASPED HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM
8422-283572-0031 ACCORDING TO RULE AND PREPARED TO RECITE PROUD MEANS BEING SET UP I THINK HE SAID RESPECTFULLY BUT I DON'T THINK I KNOW ANY EXAMPLES YOU MAY TAKE
8422-283572-0032 SHE DISAPPEARED FROM THE WINDOW AND DAVY WENT CAUTIOUSLY AROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT GOBOBBLES MIGHT BE LIKE AS HE APPROACHED THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE HE HEARD A LOUD
8422-283572-0033 THUMPING NOISE AND PRESENTLY HE CAME IN SIGHT OF GOBOBBLES WHO PROVED TO BE A LARGE AND VERY BOLD MANNERED TURKEY WITH ALL HIS FEATHERS TAKEN OFF EXCEPT
8422-283572-0034 HE WAS TIED FAST IN A BABY'S HIGH CHAIR AND WAS THUMPING HIS CHEST WITH HIS WINGS IN SUCH A VIOLENT AND ILL TEMPERED MANNER THAT DAVY AT ONCE MADE UP HIS MIND NOT TO AGGRAVATE HIM UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
8422-283572-0035 AS GOBOBBLES CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM HE DISCONTINUED HIS THUMPING AND AFTER STARING AT HIM FOR A MOMENT SAID SULKILY
8422-283572-0036 WHY NOT SAID DAVY
8422-283572-0037 SAID GOBOBBLES PASSIONATELY THEY'RE SO EVERLASTINGLY HUNGRY NOW DON'T DENY THAT YOU'RE FOND OF TURKEY WELL I DO LIKE TURKEY SAID DAVY SEEING NO WAY OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY
8422-283572-0038 OF COURSE YOU DO SAID GOBOBBLES TOSSING HIS HEAD NOW YOU MIGHT AS WELL KNOW HE CONTINUED RESUMING HIS THUMPING WITH INCREASED ENERGY THAT I'M AS HOLLOW AS A DRUM AND AS TOUGH AS A HAT BOX
8422-283572-0039 JUST MENTION THAT FACT TO ANY ONE YOU MEET WILL YOU I SUPPOSE CHRISTMAS IS COMING OF COURSE OF COURSE IT IS REPLIED DAVY IT'S ALWAYS COMING SAID GOBOBBLES ANGRILY
8422-283572-0040 I NEVER KNEW A TIME YET WHEN IT WASN'T COMING I DON'T MIND HAVING IT COME SAID DAVY STOUTLY OH DON'T YOU INDEED SAID GOBOBBLES WELL THEN
8422-283572-0041 AND HERE HE BEGAN HOPPING HIS CHAIR FORWARD IN SUCH A THREATENING MANNER THAT DAVY TURNED AND WALKED AWAY WITH AS MUCH DIGNITY AS HE COULD ASSUME AS HE WENT AROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE AGAIN
8422-283572-0042 HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A PLEASANT LANE BORDERED ON EITHER SIDE BY A TALL HEDGE AND AS HE WAS NOW OUT OF SIGHT OF GOBOBBLES
8422-283572-0043 BEFORE HE HAD GONE A DOZEN STEPS HOWEVER HE HEARD A THUMPING SOUND BEHIND HIM AND LOOKING BACK HE SAW TO HIS DISMAY THAT
8422-283572-0044 GOBOBBLES HAD IN SOME WAY GOT LOOSE FROM HIS HIGH CHAIR AND WAS COMING AFTER HIM THUMPING HIMSELF IN A PERFECT FRENZY IN FACT HIS APPEARANCE WAS SO FORMIDABLE THAT DAVY DID NOT PAUSE FOR A SECOND LOOK
8422-283572-0045 BUT STARTED OFF AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED GOBOBBLES HOWEVER PROVED HIMSELF TO BE A CAPITAL RUNNER AND IN SPITE OF ALL DAVY'S EFFORTS HE COULD HEAR THE DREADFUL THUMPING SOUND COMING NEARER AND NEARER
8422-283572-0046 UNTIL IT SEEMED TO BE JUST AT HIS HEELS AT THIS INSTANT SOMETHING SPRANG UPON HIS BACK BUT BEFORE HE COULD CRY OUT IN HIS TERROR
