584-124227-0000 AND SIDLED TOWARDS THE BASEMENT WHERE HE WAS WONT TO KEEP HIS HAT DURING BUSINESS HOURS HE WAS AWARE THAT IT WOULD BE A MATTER OF SOME DELICACY TO LEAVE THE BANK AT THAT HOUR
584-124227-0001 THERE WAS A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF WORK STILL TO BE DONE IN THE FIXED DEPOSITS DEPARTMENT WORK IN WHICH BY RIGHTS AS MIKE'S UNDERSTUDY HE SHOULD HAVE LENT A SYMPATHETIC AND HELPING HAND
584-124227-0002 BUT WHAT OF THAT HE MUSED THOUGHTFULLY SMOOTHING HIS HAT WITH HIS KNUCKLES COMRADE GREGORY IS A MAN WHO TAKES SUCH AN ENTHUSIASTIC PLEASURE IN HIS DUTIES
584-124227-0003 AS HE WALKED DELICATELY NOT COURTING OBSERVATION HE REMINDED HIMSELF OF THE HERO OF PILGRIM'S PROGRESS ON ALL SIDES OF HIM LAY FEARSOME BEASTS LYING IN WAIT TO POUNCE UPON HIM
584-124227-0004 AT ANY MOMENT MISTER GREGORY'S HOARSE ROAR MIGHT SHATTER THE COMPARATIVE STILLNESS OR THE SINISTER NOTE OF MISTER BICKERSDYKE MAKE ITSELF HEARD
584-124227-0005 HOWEVER SAID PSMITH PHILOSOPHICALLY THESE ARE LIFE'S TRIALS AND MUST BE BORNE PATIENTLY A ROUNDABOUT ROUTE
584-124227-0006 VIA THE POSTAGE AND INWARDS BILLS DEPARTMENTS TOOK HIM TO THE SWING DOORS IT WAS HERE THAT THE DANGER BECAME ACUTE THE DOORS WERE WELL WITHIN VIEW OF THE FIXED DEPOSITS DEPARTMENT
584-124227-0007 AND MISTER GREGORY HAD AN EYE COMPARED WITH WHICH THAT OF AN EAGLE WAS MORE OR LESS BLEARED PSMITH SAUNTERED TO THE DOOR AND PUSHED IT OPEN IN A GINGERLY MANNER
584-124227-0008 MISTER GREGORY WAS LEANING OVER THE BARRIER WHICH DIVIDED HIS LAIR FROM THE OUTER WORLD AND GESTICULATING VIOLENTLY WHERE ARE YOU GOING ROARED THE HEAD OF THE FIXED DEPOSITS
584-124227-0009 PSMITH DID NOT REPLY WITH A BENEVOLENT SMILE AND A GESTURE INTENDED TO SIGNIFY ALL WOULD COME RIGHT IN THE FUTURE HE SLID THROUGH THE SWING DOORS
584-124227-0010 ONE IS PRACTICALLY A HUNTED HARE EITHER THE HEADS OF MY DEPARTMENT MUST REFRAIN FROM VIEW HALLOOS WHEN THEY OBSERVE ME GOING FOR A STROLL OR I ABANDON COMMERCE FOR SOME LESS EXACTING WALK IN LIFE
584-124227-0011 HE REMOVED HIS HAT
584-124227-0012 THE EPISODE HAD BEEN DISTURBING HE WAS TO MEET HIS FATHER AT THE MANSION HOUSE
584-124227-0013 CERTAINLY MY BOY SAID MISTER SMITH SENIOR
584-124227-0014 EXCELLENT WE MUST BE GETTING ON WE MUST NOT MISS A MOMENT OF THE MATCH
584-124227-0015 WHERE'S A CAB HI CABBY NO THAT ONE'S GOT SOME ONE IN IT THERE'S ANOTHER HI HERE LUNATIC ARE YOU BLIND GOOD HE'S SEEN US
584-124227-0016 LORD'S CRICKET GROUND CABBY AS QUICK AS YOU CAN JUMP IN RUPERT MY BOY JUMP IN PSMITH RARELY JUMPED
584-124227-0017 HE ENTERED THE CAB WITH SOMETHING OF THE STATELINESS OF AN OLD ROMAN EMPEROR BOARDING HIS CHARIOT AND SETTLED HIMSELF COMFORTABLY IN HIS SEAT MISTER SMITH DIVED IN LIKE A RABBIT
584-124227-0018 A VENDOR OF NEWSPAPERS CAME TO THE CAB THRUSTING AN EVENING PAPER INTO THE INTERIOR PSMITH BOUGHT IT LET'S SEE HOW THEY'RE GETTING ON HE SAID OPENING THE PAPER WHERE ARE WE
584-124227-0019 LUNCH SCORES LORD'S
584-124227-0020 THIRTY AT LUNCH TIME HE WOULD APPEAR TO BE MAKING SOMETHING OF A STAND WITH HIS BROTHER JOE WHO HAS MADE SIXTY ONE UP TO THE MOMENT OF GOING TO PRESS IT'S POSSIBLE HE MAY STILL BE IN WHEN WE GET THERE IN WHICH CASE WE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO SLIDE INTO THE PAVILION
584-124227-0021 A GRAND BAT THAT BOY I SAID SO LAST SUMMER BETTER THAN ANY OF HIS BROTHERS
584-124227-0022 WHAT
584-124227-0023 PSMITH RELATED BRIEFLY THE HISTORY OF MIKE'S DEPARTURE MISTER SMITH LISTENED WITH INTEREST WELL HE SAID AT LAST
584-124227-0024 I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME MYSELF IN HIS PLACE PSMITH SMOOTHED HIS WAISTCOAT
584-124227-0025 THIS BANK BUSINESS IS FAR FROM BEING MUCH OF A CATCH INDEED I SHOULD DESCRIBE IT DEFINITELY AS A BIT OFF I HAVE GIVEN IT A FAIR TRIAL AND I NOW DENOUNCE IT UNHESITATINGLY AS A SHADE TOO THICK
584-124227-0026 WHAT ARE YOU GETTING TIRED OF IT NOT PRECISELY TIRED BUT
584-124227-0027 I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MY TALENTS LIE ELSEWHERE AT LUGGING LEDGERS I AM AMONG THE ALSO RANS A MERE CIPHER I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THIS FOR SOME TIME IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION I SHOULD LIKE TO GO TO THE BAR
584-124227-0028 THE BAR WELL I FANCY I SHOULD MAKE A PRETTY CONSIDERABLE HIT AS A BARRISTER MISTER SMITH REFLECTED THE IDEA HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM BEFORE NOW THAT IT WAS SUGGESTED
584-124227-0029 THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL TO BE SAID FOR THE BAR AS A CAREER PSMITH KNEW HIS FATHER
584-124227-0030 IT WAS A NEW IDEA AND AS SUCH WAS BOUND TO BE FAVOURABLY RECEIVED WHAT I SHOULD DO IF I WERE YOU
584-124227-0031 HE WENT ON AS IF HE WERE ADVISING A FRIEND ON SOME COURSE OF ACTION
584-124227-0032 THE BLOW TO THE MANAGEMENT ESPECIALLY TO COMRADE BICKERSDYKE WILL BE A PAINFUL ONE BUT IT IS THE TRUEST KINDNESS TO ADMINISTER IT SWIFTLY LET ME RESIGN TOMORROW AND DEVOTE MY TIME TO QUIET STUDY
584-124227-0033 LET US DO IT NOW
584-124227-0034 MISTER SMITH HESITATED FOR A MOMENT THEN MADE UP HIS MIND VERY WELL HE SAID I REALLY THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA THERE ARE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES OPEN TO A BARRISTER I WISH WE HAD THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE I AM
584-124227-0035 NOT ALTOGETHER SORRY THAT WE DID NOT SAID PSMITH I HAVE ENJOYED THE CHANCES MY COMMERCIAL LIFE HAS GIVEN ME OF ASSOCIATING WITH SUCH A MAN AS COMRADE BICKERSDYKE IN MANY WAYS A MASTER MIND BUT PERHAPS
584-124227-0036 IT IS AS WELL TO CLOSE THE CHAPTER HOW IT HAPPENED IT IS HARD TO SAY BUT SOMEHOW I FANCY I DID NOT PRECISELY HIT IT OFF WITH COMRADE BICKERSDYKE WITH PSMITH THE WORKER HE HAD NO FAULT TO FIND
584-124227-0037 BUT IT SEEMED TO ME SOMETIMES DURING OUR FESTIVE EVENINGS TOGETHER AT THE CLUB THAT ALL WAS NOT WELL FROM LITTLE ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE SIGNS I HAVE SUSPECTED NOW AND THEN THAT HE WOULD JUST AS SOON HAVE BEEN WITHOUT MY COMPANY
584-124227-0038 ONE CANNOT EXPLAIN THESE THINGS IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME INCOMPATIBILITY OF TEMPERAMENT PERHAPS HE WILL MANAGE TO BEAR UP AT MY DEPARTURE BUT HERE WE ARE HE ADDED AS THE CAB DREW UP
584-124227-0039 THEY PASSED THROUGH THE TURNSTILE AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE TELEGRAPH BOARD
