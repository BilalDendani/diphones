4660-25046-0000 EVEN UNBORN PUPPIES HAD JEALOUS PROSPECTIVE OWNERS WAITING TO CLAIM THEM THERE IS ALWAYS PLENTY OF ROOM AT THE TOP OF THE TREE AND GOOD HUNTING DOGS WERE AS RARE AS GOOD MEN GOOD HORSES AND GOOD FRONT OXEN
4660-25046-0001 A LOT OF QUALITIES ARE NEEDED IN THE MAKE UP OF A GOOD HUNTING DOG SIZE STRENGTH QUICKNESS SCENT SENSE AND SPEED AND PLENTY OF COURAGE THEY ARE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO GET
4660-25046-0002 BUT EVEN SMALL DOGS ARE USEFUL AND MANY A FINE FEAT STANDS TO THE CREDIT OF LITTLE TERRIERS IN GUARDING CAMPS AT NIGHT AND IN STANDING OFF WOUNDED ANIMALS THAT MEANT MISCHIEF DENNISON WAS SAVED FROM A WOUNDED LIONESS BY HIS TWO FOX TERRIERS
4660-25046-0003 HE HAD GONE OUT TO SHOOT BUSH PHEASANTS AND CAME UNEXPECTEDLY ON A LIONESS PLAYING WITH HER CUBS THE CUBS HID IN THE GRASS BUT SHE STOOD UP AT BAY TO PROTECT THEM AND HE FORGETTING THAT HE HAD TAKEN THE BIG LOOPER CARTRIDGES FROM HIS GUN AND RELOADED WITH NUMBER SIX FIRED
4660-25046-0004 THE SHOT ONLY MADDENED HER AND SHE CHARGED BUT THE TWO DOGS DASHED AT HER ONE AT EACH SIDE BARKING SNAPPING AND YELLING RUSHING IN AND JUMPING BACK SO FAST AND FURIOUSLY THAT THEY FLUSTERED HER LEAVING THE MAN FOR THE MOMENT SHE TURNED ON THEM
4660-25046-0005 DABBING VICIOUSLY WITH HER HUGE PAWS FIRST AT ONE THEN AT THE OTHER QUICK AS LIGHTNING SHE STRUCK RIGHT AND LEFT AS A KITTEN WILL AT A TWIRLED STRING BUT THEY KEPT OUT OF REACH
4660-25046-0006 SHE WAS A BULL TERRIER WITH A DULL BRINDLED COAT BLACK AND GREY IN SHADOWY STRIPES SHE HAD SMALL CROSS LOOKING EYES AND UNCERTAIN ALWAYS MOVING EARS SHE WAS BAD TEMPERED AND MOST UNSOCIABLE BUT SHE WAS AS FAITHFUL AND AS BRAVE A DOG AS EVER LIVED
4660-25046-0007 SHE NEVER BARKED NEVER HOWLED WHEN BEATEN FOR BITING STRANGERS OR KAFFIRS OR GOING FOR THE CATTLE SHE WAS VERY SILENT VERY SAVAGE AND VERY QUICK SHE BELONGED TO MY FRIEND TED AND NEVER LEFT HIS SIDE DAY OR NIGHT HER NAME WAS JESS
4660-25046-0008 PARTLY BECAUSE YOU KNEW SHE WOULD NOT STAND ANY NONSENSE NO PUSHING PATTING OR PUNISHMENT AND VERY LITTLE TALKING TO AND PARTLY BECAUSE SHE WAS SO FAITHFUL AND PLUCKY SHE WAS NOT A HUNTING DOG BUT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS HAD HELPED TO PULL DOWN WOUNDED GAME
4660-25046-0009 SHE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OR SKILL AND WAS ONLY FIERCE AND BRAVE AND THERE WAS ALWAYS THE RISK THAT SHE WOULD BE KILLED SHE WOULD LISTEN TO TED BUT TO NO ONE ELSE ONE OF US MIGHT HAVE SHOUTED HIS LUNGS OUT
4660-25046-0010 BUT IT WOULD NOT HAVE STOPPED HER FROM GIVING CHASE THE MOMENT SHE SAW ANYTHING AND KEEPING ON TILL SHE WAS TOO DEAD BEAT TO MOVE ANY FURTHER THE FIRST TIME I SAW JESS WE WERE HAVING DINNER AND I GAVE HER A BONE PUTTING IT DOWN CLOSE TO HER AND SAYING HERE GOOD DOG
4660-25046-0011 SHE GAVE A LOW GROWL AND HER LITTLE EYES TURNED ON ME FOR JUST ONE LOOK AS SHE GOT UP AND WALKED AWAY THERE WAS A SNIGGER OF LAUGHTER FROM SOME OF THE OTHERS BUT NOBODY SAID ANYTHING AND IT SEEMED WISER TO ASK NO QUESTIONS JUST THEN
4660-25046-0012 YOU MUST NOT FEED ANOTHER MAN'S DOG A DOG HAS ONLY ONE MASTER WE RESPECTED JESS GREATLY BUT NO ONE KNEW QUITE HOW MUCH WE RESPECTED HER UNTIL THE MEMORABLE DAY NEAR SHIP MOUNTAIN WE HAD RESTED THROUGH THE HEAT OF THE DAY
4660-25046-0013 UNDER A BIG TREE ON THE BANK OF A LITTLE STREAM IT WAS THE TREE UNDER WHICH SOLTKE PRAYED AND DIED ABOUT SUNDOWN JUST BEFORE WE WERE READY TO START SOME OTHER WAGGONS PASSED AND TED KNOWING THE OWNER
4660-25046-0014 WENT ON WITH HIM INTENDING TO REJOIN US AT THE NEXT OUTSPAN AS HE JUMPED ON TO THE PASSING WAGGON HE CALLED TO JESS AND SHE RAN OUT OF A PATCH OF SOFT GRASS UNDER ONE OF THE BIG TREES BEHIND OUR WAGGONS SHE ANSWERED HIS CALL INSTANTLY
4660-25046-0015 BUT WHEN SHE SAW HIM MOVING OFF ON THE OTHER WAGGON SHE SAT DOWN IN THE ROAD AND WATCHED HIM ANXIOUSLY FOR SOME SECONDS THEN RAN ON A FEW STEPS IN HER CURIOUS QUICK SILENT WAY AND AGAIN STOPPED GIVING SWIFT GLANCES ALTERNATELY TOWARDS TED AND TOWARDS US
4660-25046-0016 AND THAT SHE WOULD FOLLOW PRESENTLY AFTER HE HAD DISAPPEARED SHE RAN BACK TO HER PATCH OF GRASS AND LAY DOWN BUT IN A FEW MINUTES SHE WAS BACK AGAIN SQUATTING IN THE ROAD LOOKING WITH THAT SAME ANXIOUS WORRIED EXPRESSION AFTER HER MASTER
4660-25046-0017 THE OXEN WERE INSPANNED AND THE LAST ODD THINGS WERE BEING PUT UP WHEN ONE OF THE BOYS CAME TO SAY THAT HE COULD NOT GET THE GUNS AND WATER BARREL BECAUSE JESS WOULD NOT LET HIM NEAR THEM THERE WAS SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH THE DOG HE SAID HE THOUGHT SHE WAS MAD
4660-25046-0018 KNOWING HOW JESS HATED KAFFIRS WE LAUGHED AT THE NOTION AND WENT FOR THE THINGS OURSELVES AS WE CAME WITHIN FIVE YARDS OF THE TREE WHERE WE HAD LEFT THE GUNS THERE WAS A RUSTLE IN THE GRASS AND JESS CAME OUT WITH HER SWIFT SILENT RUN
4660-25046-0019 APPEARING AS UNEXPECTEDLY AS A SNAKE DOES AND WITH SOME ODD SUGGESTION OF A SNAKE IN HER LOOK AND ATTITUDE HER HEAD BODY AND TAIL WERE IN A DEAD LINE AND SHE WAS CROUCHING SLIGHTLY AS FOR A SPRING
4660-25046-0020 HER EARS WERE LAID FLAT BACK HER LIPS TWITCHING CONSTANTLY SHOWING THE STRONG WHITE TEETH AND HER CROSS WICKED EYES HAD SUCH A LOOK OF REMORSELESS CRUELTY IN THEM THAT WE STOPPED AS IF WE HAD BEEN TURNED TO STONE
4660-25046-0021 SHE NEVER MOVED A MUSCLE OR MADE A SOUND BUT KEPT THOSE EYES STEADILY FIXED ON US WE MOVED BACK A PACE OR TWO AND BEGAN TO COAX AND WHEEDLE HER BUT IT WAS NO GOOD SHE NEVER MOVED OR MADE A SOUND AND THE UNBLINKING LOOK REMAINED
4660-25046-0022 FOR A MINUTE WE STOOD OUR GROUND AND THEN THE HAIR ON HER BACK AND SHOULDERS BEGAN VERY SLOWLY TO STAND UP THAT WAS ENOUGH WE CLEARED OFF IT WAS A MIGHTY UNCANNY APPEARANCE THEN ANOTHER TRIED HIS HAND BUT IT WAS JUST THE SAME
4660-25046-0023 NO ONE COULD DO ANYTHING WITH HER NO ONE COULD GET NEAR THE GUNS OR THE WATER BARREL AS SOON AS WE RETURNED FOR A FRESH ATTEMPT SHE REAPPEARED IN THE SAME PLACE AND IN THE SAME WAY THE POSITION WAS TOO RIDICULOUS AND WE WERE AT OUR WITS END
4660-25046-0024 FOR JESS HELD THE CAMP THE KAFFIRS DECLARED THE DOG WAS MAD AND WE BEGAN TO HAVE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SUSPICIONS THAT THEY WERE RIGHT BUT WE DECIDED TO MAKE A LAST ATTEMPT AND SURROUNDING THE PLACE APPROACHED FROM ALL SIDES BUT THE SUDDENNESS WITH
4660-25046-0025 WHICH SHE APPEARED BEFORE WE GOT INTO POSITION SO DEMORALISED THE KAFFIRS THAT THEY BOLTED AND WE GAVE IT UP OWNING OURSELVES BEATEN
4660-25046-0026 JESS MET HIM OUT ON THE ROAD IN THE DARK WHERE SHE HAD BEEN WATCHING HALF THE TIME EVER SINCE HE LEFT
