1054-143005-0000 JUST BEFORE WE LEFT MY FATHER SAID MISTER BORLSOVER MAY MY SON HERE SHAKE HANDS WITH YOU IT WILL BE A THING TO LOOK BACK UPON WITH PRIDE WHEN HE GROWS TO BE A MAN I CAME UP TO THE BED ON WHICH THE OLD MAN WAS LYING
1054-143005-0001 AND PUT MY HAND IN HIS AWED BY THE STILL BEAUTY OF HIS FACE HE SPOKE TO ME KINDLY AND HOPED THAT I SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO PLEASE MY FATHER THEN HE PLACED HIS RIGHT HAND ON MY HEAD AND ASKED FOR A BLESSING TO REST UPON ME
1054-143005-0002 AMEN SAID MY FATHER AND I FOLLOWED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM FEELING AS IF I WANTED TO CRY BUT MY FATHER WAS IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS THAT OLD GENTLEMAN JIM SAID HE IS THE MOST WONDERFUL MAN IN THE WHOLE TOWN
1054-143005-0003 FOR TEN YEARS HE HAS BEEN QUITE BLIND BUT I SAW HIS EYES I SAID THEY WERE EVER SO BLACK AND SHINY THEY WEREN'T SHUT UP LIKE NORA'S PUPPIES CAN'T HE SEE AT ALL AND SO I LEARNT FOR THE FIRST TIME
1054-143005-0004 THAT A MAN MIGHT HAVE EYES THAT LOOKED DARK AND BEAUTIFUL AND SHINING WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE JUST LIKE MISSUS TOMLINSON HAS BIG EARS I SAID
1054-143005-0005 JIM SAID MY FATHER IT'S NOT RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT A LADY'S EARS REMEMBER WHAT MISTER BORLSOVER SAID ABOUT PLEASING ME AND BEING A GOOD BOY THAT WAS THE ONLY TIME I SAW ADRIAN BORLSOVER I SOON FORGOT ABOUT HIM AND THE HAND WHICH HE LAID IN BLESSING ON MY HEAD
1054-143005-0006 BUT FOR A WEEK I PRAYED THAT THOSE DARK TENDER EYES MIGHT SEE HIS SPANIEL MAY HAVE PUPPIES I SAID IN MY PRAYERS AND HE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO KNOW HOW FUNNY THEY LOOK WITH THEIR EYES ALL CLOSED UP PLEASE LET OLD MISTER BORLSOVER SEE
1054-143005-0007 ADRIAN BORLSOVER AS MY FATHER HAD SAID WAS A WONDERFUL MAN HE CAME OF AN ECCENTRIC FAMILY BORLSOVERS SONS FOR SOME REASON ALWAYS SEEMED TO MARRY VERY ORDINARY WOMEN
1054-143005-0008 WHICH PERHAPS ACCOUNTED FOR THE FACT THAT NO BORLSOVER HAD BEEN A GENIUS AND ONLY ONE BORLSOVER HAD BEEN MAD BUT THEY WERE GREAT CHAMPIONS OF LITTLE CAUSES GENEROUS PATRONS OF ODD SCIENCES FOUNDERS OF QUERULOUS SECTS
1054-143005-0009 TRUSTWORTHY GUIDES TO THE BYPATH MEADOWS OF ERUDITION ADRIAN WAS AN AUTHORITY ON THE FERTILIZATION OF ORCHIDS HE HAD HELD AT ONE TIME THE FAMILY LIVING AT BORLSOVER CONYERS UNTIL A CONGENITAL WEAKNESS OF THE LUNGS
1054-143005-0010 OBLIGED HIM TO SEEK A LESS RIGOROUS CLIMATE IN THE SUNNY SOUTH COAST WATERING PLACE WHERE I HAD SEEN HIM OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD RELIEVE ONE OR OTHER OF THE LOCAL CLERGY MY FATHER DESCRIBED HIM AS A FINE PREACHER
1054-143005-0011 WHO GAVE LONG AND INSPIRING SERMONS FROM WHAT MANY MEN WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED UNPROFITABLE TEXTS AN EXCELLENT PROOF HE WOULD ADD OF THE TRUTH OF THE DOCTRINE OF DIRECT VERBAL INSPIRATION ADRIAN BORLSOVER WAS EXCEEDINGLY CLEVER WITH HIS HANDS
1054-143005-0012 HIS PENMANSHIP WAS EXQUISITE HE ILLUSTRATED ALL HIS SCIENTIFIC PAPERS MADE HIS OWN WOODCUTS AND CARVED THE REREDOS THAT IS AT PRESENT THE CHIEF FEATURE OF INTEREST IN THE CHURCH AT BORLSOVER CONYERS
1054-143005-0013 HE HAD AN EXCEEDINGLY CLEVER KNACK IN CUTTING SILHOUETTES FOR YOUNG LADIES AND PAPER PIGS AND COWS FOR LITTLE CHILDREN AND MADE MORE THAN ONE COMPLICATED WIND INSTRUMENT OF HIS OWN DEVISING
1054-143005-0014 HE QUICKLY LEARNED TO READ BRAILLE SO MARVELOUS INDEED WAS HIS SENSE OF TOUCH THAT HE WAS STILL ABLE TO MAINTAIN HIS INTEREST IN BOTANY THE MERE PASSING OF HIS LONG SUPPLE FINGERS OVER A FLOWER WAS SUFFICIENT MEANS FOR ITS IDENTIFICATION
1054-143005-0015 THOUGH OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD USE HIS LIPS I HAVE FOUND SEVERAL LETTERS OF HIS AMONG MY FATHER'S CORRESPONDENCE IN NO CASE WAS THERE ANYTHING TO SHOW THAT HE WAS AFFLICTED WITH BLINDNESS
1054-143005-0016 AND THIS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT HE EXERCISED UNDUE ECONOMY IN THE SPACING OF LINES TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF HIS LIFE THE OLD MAN WAS CREDITED WITH POWERS OF TOUCH THAT SEEMED ALMOST UNCANNY IT HAS BEEN SAID
1054-143005-0017 THAT HE COULD TELL AT ONCE THE COLOR OF A RIBBON PLACED BETWEEN HIS FINGERS MY FATHER WOULD NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY THE STORY
1054-143005-0018 ADRIAN BORLSOVER WAS A BACHELOR HIS ELDER BROTHER GEORGE HAD MARRIED LATE IN LIFE LEAVING ONE SON EUSTACE WHO LIVED IN THE GLOOMY GEORGIAN MANSION AT BORLSOVER CONYERS
1054-143005-0019 WHERE HE COULD WORK UNDISTURBED IN COLLECTING MATERIAL FOR HIS GREAT BOOK ON HEREDITY LIKE HIS UNCLE HE WAS A REMARKABLE MAN THE BORLSOVERS HAD ALWAYS BEEN BORN NATURALISTS
1054-143005-0020 BUT EUSTACE POSSESSED IN A SPECIAL DEGREE THE POWER OF SYSTEMATIZING HIS KNOWLEDGE HE HAD RECEIVED HIS UNIVERSITY EDUCATION IN GERMANY AND THEN AFTER POST GRADUATE WORK IN VIENNA AND NAPLES
1054-143005-0021 GETTING TOGETHER A HUGE STORE OF MATERIAL FOR A NEW STUDY INTO THE PROCESSES OF VARIATION HE LIVED ALONE AT BORLSOVER CONYERS WITH SAUNDERS HIS SECRETARY A MAN WHO BORE A SOMEWHAT DUBIOUS REPUTATION IN THE DISTRICT
1054-143005-0022 BUT WHOSE POWERS AS A MATHEMATICIAN COMBINED WITH HIS BUSINESS ABILITIES WERE INVALUABLE TO EUSTACE UNCLE AND NEPHEW SAW LITTLE OF EACH OTHER THE VISITS OF EUSTACE WERE CONFINED TO A WEEK IN THE SUMMER OR AUTUMN
1054-143005-0023 LONG WEEKS THAT DRAGGED ALMOST AS SLOWLY AS THE BATH CHAIR IN WHICH THE OLD MAN WAS DRAWN ALONG THE SUNNY SEA FRONT IN THEIR WAY THE TWO MEN WERE FOND OF EACH OTHER THOUGH THEIR INTIMACY WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE BEEN GREATER
1054-143005-0024 HAD THEY SHARED THE SAME RELIGIOUS VIEWS ADRIAN HELD TO THE OLD FASHIONED EVANGELICAL DOGMAS OF HIS EARLY MANHOOD HIS NEPHEW FOR MANY YEARS HAD BEEN THINKING OF EMBRACING BUDDHISM BOTH MEN POSSESSED TOO
1054-143005-0025 THE RETICENCE THE BORLSOVERS HAD ALWAYS SHOWN AND WHICH THEIR ENEMIES SOMETIMES CALLED HYPOCRISY WITH ADRIAN IT WAS A RETICENCE AS TO THE THINGS HE HAD LEFT UNDONE BUT WITH EUSTACE
1054-143005-0026 IT SEEMED THAT THE CURTAIN WHICH HE WAS SO CAREFUL TO LEAVE UNDRAWN HID SOMETHING MORE THAN A HALF EMPTY CHAMBER TWO YEARS BEFORE HIS DEATH ADRIAN BORLSOVER DEVELOPED UNKNOWN TO HIMSELF THE NOT UNCOMMON POWER OF AUTOMATIC WRITING
1054-143005-0027 EUSTACE MADE THE DISCOVERY BY ACCIDENT ADRIAN WAS SITTING READING IN BED THE FOREFINGER OF HIS LEFT HAND TRACING THE BRAILLE CHARACTERS WHEN HIS NEPHEW NOTICED THAT A PENCIL THE OLD MAN HELD IN HIS RIGHT HAND WAS MOVING SLOWLY ALONG THE OPPOSITE PAGE
1054-143005-0028 HE LEFT HIS SEAT IN THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN BESIDE THE BED THE RIGHT HAND CONTINUED TO MOVE AND NOW HE COULD SEE PLAINLY THAT THEY WERE LETTERS AND WORDS WHICH IT WAS FORMING ADRIAN BORLSOVER WROTE THE HAND EUSTACE BORLSOVER
1054-143005-0029 GEORGE BORLSOVER FRANCIS BORLSOVER SIGISMUND BORLSOVER ADRIAN BORLSOVER EUSTACE BORLSOVER SAVILLE BORLSOVER B FOR BORLSOVER HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY
1054-143005-0030 BEAUTIFUL BELINDA BORLSOVER WHAT CURIOUS NONSENSE SAID EUSTACE TO HIMSELF KING GEORGE THE THIRD ASCENDED THE THRONE IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY WROTE THE HAND CROWD A NOUN OF MULTITUDE A COLLECTION OF INDIVIDUALS
1054-143005-0031 ADRIAN BORLSOVER EUSTACE BORLSOVER IT SEEMS TO ME SAID HIS UNCLE CLOSING THE BOOK THAT YOU HAD MUCH BETTER MAKE THE MOST OF THE AFTERNOON SUNSHINE AND TAKE YOUR WALK NOW I THINK PERHAPS I WILL EUSTACE ANSWERED AS HE PICKED UP THE VOLUME
1054-143005-0032 I WON'T GO FAR AND WHEN I COME BACK I CAN READ TO YOU THOSE ARTICLES IN NATURE ABOUT WHICH WE WERE SPEAKING HE WENT ALONG THE PROMENADE BUT STOPPED AT THE FIRST SHELTER AND SEATING HIMSELF IN THE CORNER BEST PROTECTED FROM THE WIND HE EXAMINED THE BOOK AT LEISURE
1054-143005-0033 NEARLY EVERY PAGE WAS SCORED WITH A MEANINGLESS JUNGLE OF PENCIL MARKS ROWS OF CAPITAL LETTERS SHORT WORDS LONG WORDS COMPLETE SENTENCES COPY BOOK TAGS THE WHOLE THING IN FACT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A COPY BOOK
1054-143005-0034 EUSTACE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS AMPLE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THE HANDWRITING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK GOOD THOUGH IT WAS WAS NOT NEARLY SO GOOD AS THE HANDWRITING AT THE END HE LEFT HIS UNCLE AT THE END OF OCTOBER
1054-143005-0035 IT SEEMED TO HIM QUITE CLEAR THAT THE OLD MAN'S POWER OF AUTOMATIC WRITING WAS DEVELOPING RAPIDLY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HE LOOKED FORWARD TO A VISIT THAT COMBINED DUTY WITH INTEREST BUT ON HIS RETURN HE WAS AT FIRST DISAPPOINTED
1054-143005-0036 HIS UNCLE HE THOUGHT LOOKED OLDER HE WAS LISTLESS TOO PREFERRING OTHERS TO READ TO HIM AND DICTATING NEARLY ALL HIS LETTERS NOT UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE HE LEFT HAD EUSTACE AN OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVING ADRIAN BORLSOVER'S NEW FOUND FACULTY
1054-143005-0037 THE OLD MAN PROPPED UP IN BED WITH PILLOWS HAD SUNK INTO A LIGHT SLEEP HIS TWO HANDS LAY ON THE COVERLET HIS LEFT HAND TIGHTLY CLASPING HIS RIGHT EUSTACE TOOK AN EMPTY MANUSCRIPT BOOK
1054-143005-0038 AND PLACED A PENCIL WITHIN REACH OF THE FINGERS OF THE RIGHT HAND THEY SNATCHED AT IT EAGERLY THEN DROPPED THE PENCIL TO UNLOOSE THE LEFT HAND FROM ITS RESTRAINING GRASP PERHAPS TO PREVENT INTERFERENCE I HAD BETTER HOLD THAT HAND SAID EUSTACE TO HIMSELF
1054-143005-0039 AS HE WATCHED THE PENCIL ALMOST IMMEDIATELY IT BEGAN TO WRITE BLUNDERING BORLSOVERS UNNECESSARILY UNNATURAL EXTRAORDINARILY ECCENTRIC CULPABLY CURIOUS WHO ARE YOU ASKED EUSTACE IN A LOW VOICE
1054-143005-0040 NEVER YOU MIND WROTE THE HAND OF ADRIAN IS IT MY UNCLE WHO IS WRITING OH MY PROPHETIC SOUL MINE UNCLE IS IT ANYONE I KNOW SILLY EUSTACE YOU'LL SEE ME VERY SOON
1054-143005-0041 WHEN SHALL I SEE YOU WHEN POOR OLD ADRIAN'S DEAD WHERE SHALL I SEE YOU WHERE SHALL YOU NOT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING HIS NEXT QUESTION BORLSOVER WROTE IT WHAT IS THE TIME
1054-143005-0042 THEN PICKING UP THE PENCIL THEY WROTE TEN MINUTES BEFORE FOUR PUT YOUR BOOK AWAY EUSTACE ADRIAN MUSTN'T FIND US WORKING AT THIS SORT OF THING HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT AND I WON'T HAVE POOR OLD ADRIAN DISTURBED
1054-143005-0043 ADRIAN BORLSOVER AWOKE WITH A START I'VE BEEN DREAMING AGAIN HE SAID
1054-143005-0044 YOU WERE MIXED UP IN THIS ONE EUSTACE THOUGH I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW EUSTACE I WANT TO WARN YOU
1054-143005-0045 IT'S TOO LATE ADRIAN HE READ WE'RE FRIENDS ALREADY AREN'T WE EUSTACE BORLSOVER ON THE FOLLOWING DAY EUSTACE BORLSOVER LEFT HE THOUGHT HIS UNCLE LOOKED ILL WHEN HE SAID GOOD BY AND THE OLD MAN SPOKE DESPONDENTLY OF THE FAILURE HIS LIFE HAD BEEN
1054-143005-0046 NONSENSE UNCLE SAID HIS NEPHEW YOU HAVE GOT OVER YOUR DIFFICULTIES IN A WAY NOT ONE IN A HUNDRED THOUSAND WOULD HAVE DONE EVERY ONE MARVELS AT YOUR SPLENDID PERSEVERANCE IN TEACHING YOUR HAND TO TAKE THE PLACE OF YOUR LOST SIGHT
1054-143005-0047 TO ME IT'S BEEN A REVELATION OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF EDUCATION EDUCATION SAID HIS UNCLE DREAMILY AS IF THE WORD HAD STARTED A NEW TRAIN OF THOUGHT EDUCATION IS GOOD SO LONG AS YOU KNOW TO WHOM AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE YOU GIVE IT
1054-143005-0048 BUT WITH THE LOWER ORDERS OF MEN THE BASE AND MORE SORDID SPIRITS I HAVE GRAVE DOUBTS AS TO ITS RESULTS WELL GOOD BY EUSTACE I MAY NOT SEE YOU AGAIN YOU ARE A TRUE BORLSOVER
1054-143005-0049 MARRY EUSTACE MARRY SOME GOOD SENSIBLE GIRL AND IF BY ANY CHANCE I DON'T SEE YOU AGAIN MY WILL IS AT MY SOLICITOR'S I'VE NOT LEFT YOU ANY LEGACY BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE WELL PROVIDED FOR BUT I THOUGHT
1054-143005-0050 YOU MIGHT LIKE TO HAVE MY BOOKS OH AND THERE'S JUST ONE OTHER THING YOU KNOW BEFORE THE END PEOPLE OFTEN LOSE CONTROL OVER THEMSELVES AND MAKE ABSURD REQUESTS DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THEM EUSTACE GOOD BY AND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
1054-143005-0051 EUSTACE TOOK IT IT REMAINED IN HIS A FRACTION OF A SECOND LONGER THAN HE HAD EXPECTED AND GRIPPED HIM WITH A VIRILITY THAT WAS SURPRISING THERE WAS TOO IN ITS TOUCH A SUBTLE SENSE OF INTIMACY WHY UNCLE HE SAID
1054-143005-0052 I SHALL SEE YOU ALIVE AND WELL FOR MANY LONG YEARS TO COME TWO MONTHS LATER ADRIAN BORLSOVER DIED
1054-143005-0053 EUSTACE BORLSOVER WAS IN NAPLES AT THE TIME HE READ THE OBITUARY NOTICE IN THE MORNING POST ON THE DAY ANNOUNCED FOR THE FUNERAL POOR OLD FELLOW HE SAID I WONDER WHERE I SHALL FIND ROOM FOR ALL HIS BOOKS
1054-143005-0054 THE QUESTION OCCURRED TO HIM AGAIN WITH GREATER FORCE
1054-143005-0055 HE FOUND HIMSELF STANDING IN THE LIBRARY AT BORLSOVER CONYERS A HUGE ROOM BUILT FOR USE AND NOT FOR BEAUTY IN THE YEAR OF WATERLOO BY A BORLSOVER WHO WAS AN ARDENT ADMIRER OF THE GREAT NAPOLEON IT WAS ARRANGED
1054-143005-0056 ON THE PLAN OF MANY COLLEGE LIBRARIES WITH TALL PROJECTING BOOKCASES FORMING DEEP RECESSES OF DUSTY SILENCE FIT GRAVES FOR THE OLD HATES OF FORGOTTEN CONTROVERSY THE DEAD PASSIONS OF FORGOTTEN LIVES
1054-143005-0057 AT THE END OF THE ROOM BEHIND THE BUST OF SOME UNKNOWN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY DIVINE AN UGLY IRON CORKSCREW STAIR LED TO A SHELF LINED GALLERY NEARLY EVERY SHELF WAS FULL I MUST TALK TO SAUNDERS ABOUT IT SAID EUSTACE
1054-143005-0058 I SUPPOSE THAT IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO HAVE THE BILLIARD ROOM FITTED UP WITH BOOK CASES THE TWO MEN MET FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER MANY WEEKS IN THE DINING ROOM THAT EVENING HULLO SAID EUSTACE STANDING BEFORE THE FIRE WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS
1054-143005-0059 HOW GOES THE WORLD SAUNDERS WHY THESE DRESS TOGS HE HIMSELF WAS WEARING AN OLD SHOOTING JACKET HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN MOURNING AS HE HAD TOLD HIS UNCLE ON HIS LAST VISIT AND THOUGH HE USUALLY WENT IN FOR QUIET COLORED TIES
1054-143005-0060 HE WORE THIS EVENING ONE OF AN UGLY RED IN ORDER TO SHOCK MORTON THE BUTLER
1054-143005-0061 IN THE SERVANTS HALL EUSTACE WAS A TRUE BORLSOVER THE WORLD SAID SAUNDERS GOES THE SAME AS USUAL CONFOUNDEDLY SLOW THE DRESS TOGS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY AN INVITATION FROM CAPTAIN LOCKWOOD TO BRIDGE
1054-143005-0062 HOW ARE YOU GETTING THERE I'VE TOLD YOUR COACHMAN TO DRIVE ME IN YOUR CARRIAGE ANY OBJECTION OH DEAR ME NO WE'VE HAD ALL THINGS IN COMMON FOR FAR TOO MANY YEARS FOR ME TO RAISE OBJECTIONS AT THIS HOUR OF THE DAY
1054-143005-0063 YOU'LL FIND YOUR CORRESPONDENCE IN THE LIBRARY WENT ON SAUNDERS MOST OF IT I'VE SEEN TO THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATE LETTERS I HAVEN'T OPENED THERE'S ALSO A BOX WITH A RAT OR SOMETHING INSIDE IT THAT CAME BY THE EVENING POST
1054-143005-0064 VERY LIKELY IT'S THE SIX TOED ALBINO I DIDN'T LOOK BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO MESS UP MY THINGS BUT I SHOULD GATHER FROM THE WAY IT'S JUMPING ABOUT THAT IT'S PRETTY HUNGRY OH I'LL SEE TO IT SAID EUSTACE WHILE YOU AND THE CAPTAIN EARN AN HONEST PENNY
1054-143005-0065 DINNER OVER AND SAUNDERS GONE EUSTACE WENT INTO THE LIBRARY THOUGH THE FIRE HAD BEEN LIT THE ROOM WAS BY NO MEANS CHEERFUL WE'LL HAVE ALL THE LIGHTS ON AT ANY RATE HE SAID AS HE TURNED THE SWITCHES AND MORTON HE ADDED
1054-143005-0066 WHEN THE BUTLER BROUGHT THE COFFEE GET ME A SCREWDRIVER OR SOMETHING TO UNDO THIS BOX WHATEVER THE ANIMAL IS HE'S KICKING UP THE DEUCE OF A ROW WHAT IS IT WHY ARE YOU DAWDLING IF YOU PLEASE SIR WHEN THE POSTMAN BROUGHT IT
1054-143005-0067 HE TOLD ME THAT THEY'D BORED THE HOLES IN THE LID AT THE POST OFFICE THERE WERE NO BREATHIN HOLES IN THE LID SIR AND THEY DIDN'T WANT THE ANIMAL TO DIE THAT IS ALL SIR IT'S CULPABLY CARELESS OF THE MAN WHOEVER HE WAS SAID EUSTACE
1054-143005-0068 AS HE REMOVED THE SCREWS PACKING AN ANIMAL LIKE THIS IN A WOODEN BOX WITH NO MEANS OF GETTING AIR CONFOUND IT ALL
1054-143005-0069 NOW I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO GET ONE MYSELF HE PLACED A HEAVY BOOK ON THE LID FROM WHICH THE SCREWS HAD BEEN REMOVED AND WENT INTO THE BILLIARD ROOM AS HE CAME BACK INTO THE LIBRARY WITH AN EMPTY CAGE IN HIS HAND HE HEARD THE SOUND OF SOMETHING FALLING
1054-143005-0070 AND THEN OF SOMETHING SCUTTLING ALONG THE FLOOR BOTHER IT THE BEAST'S GOT OUT HOW IN THE WORLD AM I TO FIND IT AGAIN IN THIS LIBRARY TO SEARCH FOR IT DID INDEED SEEM HOPELESS HE TRIED TO FOLLOW THE SOUND OF THE SCUTTLING IN ONE OF THE RECESSES
1054-143005-0071 WHERE THE ANIMAL SEEMED TO BE RUNNING BEHIND THE BOOKS IN THE SHELVES BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOCATE IT EUSTACE RESOLVED TO GO ON QUIETLY READING VERY LIKELY THE ANIMAL MIGHT GAIN CONFIDENCE AND SHOW ITSELF
1054-143005-0072 IN HIS USUAL METHODICAL MANNER WITH MOST OF THE CORRESPONDENCE THERE WERE STILL THE PRIVATE LETTERS WHAT WAS THAT TWO SHARP CLICKS AND THE LIGHTS IN THE HIDEOUS CANDELABRA THAT HUNG FROM THE CEILING SUDDENLY WENT OUT
1054-143005-0073 I WONDER IF SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG WITH THE FUSE SAID EUSTACE
1054-143005-0074 AS IF SOMETHING WAS CRAWLING UP THE IRON CORKSCREW STAIR IF IT'S GONE INTO THE GALLERY HE SAID WELL AND GOOD HE HASTILY TURNED ON THE LIGHTS CROSSED THE ROOM AND CLIMBED UP THE STAIR BUT HE COULD SEE NOTHING
1054-143005-0075 HIS GRANDFATHER HAD PLACED A LITTLE GATE AT THE TOP OF THE STAIR SO THAT CHILDREN COULD RUN AND ROMP IN THE GALLERY WITHOUT FEAR OF ACCIDENT THIS EUSTACE CLOSED
1054-143005-0076 RETURNED TO HIS DESK BY THE FIRE HOW GLOOMY THE LIBRARY WAS THERE WAS NO SENSE OF INTIMACY ABOUT THE ROOM THE FEW BUSTS THAT AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY BORLSOVER HAD BROUGHT BACK FROM THE GRAND TOUR MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN KEEPING IN THE OLD LIBRARY
1054-143005-0077 HERE THEY SEEMED OUT OF PLACE THEY MADE THE ROOM FEEL COLD IN SPITE OF THE HEAVY RED DAMASK CURTAINS AND GREAT GILT CORNICES WITH A CRASH TWO HEAVY BOOKS FELL FROM THE GALLERY TO THE FLOOR THEN
1054-143005-0078 AS BORLSOVER LOOKED ANOTHER AND YET ANOTHER VERY WELL YOU'LL STARVE FOR THIS MY BEAUTY HE SAID WE'LL DO SOME LITTLE EXPERIMENTS ON THE METABOLISM OF RATS DEPRIVED OF WATER GO ON CHUCK THEM DOWN I THINK I'VE GOT THE UPPER HAND
1054-143005-0079 HE TURNED ONCE AGAIN TO HIS CORRESPONDENCE THE LETTER WAS FROM THE FAMILY SOLICITOR IT SPOKE OF HIS UNCLE'S DEATH AND OF THE VALUABLE COLLECTION OF BOOKS THAT HAD BEEN LEFT TO HIM IN THE WILL
1054-143005-0080 WHICH CERTAINLY CAME AS A SURPRISE TO ME AS YOU KNOW MISTER ADRIAN BORLSOVER HAD LEFT INSTRUCTIONS THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE BURIED IN AS SIMPLE A MANNER AS POSSIBLE AT EASTBOURNE HE EXPRESSED A DESIRE
1054-143005-0081 AND HOPED THAT HIS FRIENDS AND RELATIVES WOULD NOT CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO WEAR MOURNING THE DAY BEFORE HIS DEATH WE RECEIVED A LETTER CANCELING THESE INSTRUCTIONS HE WISHED HIS BODY TO BE EMBALMED HE GAVE US THE ADDRESS OF THE MAN WE WERE TO EMPLOY
1054-143005-0082 PENNIFER LUDGATE HILL WITH ORDERS THAT HIS RIGHT HAND WAS TO BE SENT TO YOU STATING THAT IT WAS AT YOUR SPECIAL REQUEST
1054-143005-0083 GOOD LORD SAID EUSTACE WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS THE OLD BOY DRIVING AT AND WHAT IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT'S HOLY IS THAT SOMEONE WAS IN THE GALLERY SOMEONE HAD PULLED THE CORD ATTACHED TO ONE OF THE BLINDS
1054-143005-0084 AND IT HAD ROLLED UP WITH A SNAP SOMEONE MUST BE IN THE GALLERY FOR A SECOND BLIND DID THE SAME SOMEONE MUST BE WALKING ROUND THE GALLERY FOR ONE AFTER THE OTHER THE BLINDS SPRANG UP LETTING IN THE MOONLIGHT
1054-143005-0085 I HAVEN'T GOT TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS YET SAID EUSTACE BUT I WILL DO BEFORE THE NIGHT IS VERY MUCH OLDER AND HE HURRIED UP THE CORKSCREW STAIR HE HAD JUST GOT TO THE TOP WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT A SECOND TIME AND HE HEARD AGAIN THE SCUTTLING ALONG THE FLOOR
1054-143005-0086 QUICKLY HE STOLE ON TIPTOE IN THE DIM MOONSHINE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE NOISE FEELING AS HE WENT FOR ONE OF THE SWITCHES HIS FINGERS TOUCHED THE METAL KNOB AT LAST HE TURNED ON THE ELECTRIC LIGHT ABOUT TEN YARDS IN FRONT OF HIM
1054-143005-0087 CRAWLING ALONG THE FLOOR WAS A MAN'S HAND EUSTACE STARED AT IT IN UTTER ASTONISHMENT IT WAS MOVING QUICKLY IN THE MANNER OF A GEOMETER CATERPILLAR THE FINGERS HUMPED UP ONE MOMENT FLATTENED OUT THE NEXT
1054-143005-0088 THE THUMB APPEARED TO GIVE A CRAB LIKE MOTION TO THE WHOLE WHILE HE WAS LOOKING TOO SURPRISED TO STIR THE HAND DISAPPEARED ROUND THE CORNER EUSTACE RAN FORWARD HE NO LONGER SAW IT BUT HE COULD HEAR IT
1054-143005-0089 AS IT SQUEEZED ITS WAY BEHIND THE BOOKS ON ONE OF THE SHELVES A HEAVY VOLUME HAD BEEN DISPLACED THERE WAS A GAP IN THE ROW OF BOOKS WHERE IT HAD GOT IN IN HIS FEAR LEST IT SHOULD ESCAPE HIM AGAIN
1054-143005-0090 HE SEIZED THE FIRST BOOK THAT CAME TO HIS HAND AND PLUGGED IT INTO THE HOLE THEN EMPTYING TWO SHELVES OF THEIR CONTENTS HE TOOK THE WOODEN BOARDS AND PROPPED THEM UP IN FRONT TO MAKE HIS BARRIER DOUBLY SURE I WISH SAUNDERS WAS BACK HE SAID
1054-143005-0091 ONE CAN'T TACKLE THIS SORT OF THING ALONE IT WAS AFTER ELEVEN AND THERE SEEMED LITTLE LIKELIHOOD OF SAUNDERS RETURNING BEFORE TWELVE HE DID NOT DARE TO LEAVE THE SHELF UNWATCHED EVEN TO RUN DOWNSTAIRS TO RING THE BELL
1054-143005-0092 MORTON THE BUTLER OFTEN USED TO COME ROUND ABOUT ELEVEN TO SEE THAT THE WINDOWS WERE FASTENED BUT HE MIGHT NOT COME EUSTACE WAS THOROUGHLY UNSTRUNG
1054-143005-0093 MORTON HE SHOUTED MORTON SIR HAS MISTER SAUNDERS GOT BACK YET NOT YET SIR WELL BRING ME SOME BRANDY AND HURRY UP ABOUT IT I'M UP HERE IN THE GALLERY YOU DUFFER
