5019-38670-0000 DURING THE OFFICE HOURS SHE STUDIED THOSE DETAILS OF THE BUSINESS AT FRANKFORT WHICH DIFFERED FROM THE DETAILS OF THE BUSINESS IN LONDON AND SOON MASTERED THEM SUFFICIENTLY TO BE ABLE TO FILL THE VACANCY WHICH MISTER ENGELMAN HAD LEFT

5019-38670-0003 WHOSE WORK SHE HAD DISCOVERED IN HER LATE HUSBAND'S LIBRARY AND ASSISTED HIM IN ATTRACTING PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THE HUMANE SYSTEM WHICH HE ADVOCATED EVEN THE PLAN FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OF RESPECTABLE GIRLS
5019-38670-0004 IN SUITABLE DEPARTMENTS OF THE OFFICE WAS NOT LEFT NEGLECTED BY THIS INDEFATIGABLE WOMAN THE SAME FRIENDLY CONSIDERATION WHICH HAD INDUCED HER TO SPARE MISTER KELLER ANY ALLUSION TO THE SUBJECT
5019-38670-0005 STILL KEPT HER SILENT UNTIL TIME HAD RECONCILED HIM TO THE CALAMITY OF HIS PARTNER'S DEATH PRIVATELY HOWEVER SHE HAD CAUSED INQUIRIES TO BE MADE IN FRANKFORT
5019-38670-0006 WHICH WOULD ASSIST HER IN CHOOSING WORTHY CANDIDATES FOR EMPLOYMENT WHEN THE FAVORABLE TIME CAME PROBABLY AFTER THE CELEBRATION OF FRITZ'S MARRIAGE FOR ACTING IN THE INTERESTS OF THE PROPOSED REFORM
5019-38670-0007 PRAY SEND ME AWAY IF I INTERRUPT YOU SAID MADAME FONTAINE PAUSING MODESTLY ON THE THRESHOLD BEFORE SHE ENTERED THE ROOM SHE SPOKE ENGLISH ADMIRABLY
5019-38670-0008 AND MADE A POINT OF IGNORING MISSUS WAGNER'S EQUALLY PERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF GERMAN BY ADDRESSING HER ALWAYS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE COME IN BY ALL MEANS MISSUS WAGNER ANSWERED

5019-38670-0011 AND I WANT TO MAKE MY PEACE WITH HIM JACK LOOKED UP FROM HIS WORK WITH AN AIR OF LOFTY DISDAIN OH DEAR ME IT DOESN'T MATTER HE SAID IN HIS MOST MAGNIFICENT MANNER I WAS DRESSING WHEN HE KNOCKED AT MY DOOR
5019-38670-0012 PURSUED MADAME FONTAINE AND I ASKED HIM TO COME BACK AND SHOW ME HIS KEYS IN HALF AN HOUR WHY DIDN'T YOU RETURN JACK WON'T YOU SHOW ME THE KEYS NOW YOU SEE IT'S A MATTER OF BUSINESS JACK REPLIED AS LOFTILY AS EVER
5019-38670-0013 I AM IN THE BUSINESS KEEPER OF THE KEYS MISTRESS IS IN THE BUSINESS MISTER KELLER IS IN THE BUSINESS YOU ARE NOT IN THE BUSINESS IT DOESN'T MATTER UPON MY SOUL IT DOESN'T MATTER
5019-38670-0014 MISSUS WAGNER HELD UP HER FOREFINGER REPROVINGLY JACK DON'T FORGET YOU ARE SPEAKING TO A LADY JACK AUDACIOUSLY PUT HIS HAND TO HIS HEAD
5019-38670-0015 WHICH WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH TO EXPECT OF HIM ANYTHING TO PLEASE YOU MISTRESS HE SAID I'LL SHOW HER THE BAG HE EXHIBITED TO MADAME FONTAINE A LEATHER BAG WITH A STRAP FASTENED ROUND IT
5019-38670-0016 THE KEYS ARE INSIDE HE EXPLAINED I WORE THEM LOOSE THIS MORNING AND THEY MADE A FINE JINGLE QUITE MUSICAL TO MY EAR BUT MISTRESS THOUGHT THE NOISE LIKELY TO BE A NUISANCE IN THE LONG RUN SO I STRAPPED THEM UP IN A BAG TO KEEP THEM QUIET
5019-38670-0017 AND WHEN I MOVE ABOUT THE BAG HANGS FROM MY SHOULDER LIKE THIS BY ANOTHER STRAP WHEN THE KEYS ARE WANTED I OPEN THE BAG YOU DON'T WANT THEM YOU'RE NOT IN THE BUSINESS BESIDES
5019-38670-0018 I'M THINKING OF GOING OUT AND SHOWING MYSELF AND MY BAG IN THE FASHIONABLE QUARTER OF THE TOWN ON SUCH AN OCCASION I THINK I OUGHT TO PRESENT THE APPEARANCE OF A GENTLEMAN I OUGHT TO WEAR GLOVES OH IT DOESN'T MATTER
5019-38670-0019 I NEEDN'T DETAIN YOU ANY LONGER GOOD MORNING HE MADE ONE OF HIS FANTASTIC BOWS AND WAVED HIS HAND DISMISSING MADAME FONTAINE FROM FURTHER ATTENDANCE ON HIM SECRETLY HE WAS AS EAGER AS EVER TO SHOW THE KEYS
5019-38670-0020 BUT THE INORDINATE VANITY WHICH WAS STILL THE MAD SIDE OF HIM AND THE INCURABLE SIDE OF HIM SHRANK FROM OPENING THE LEATHER BAG UNLESS THE WIDOW FIRST MADE A SPECIAL REQUEST AND A SPECIAL FAVOR OF IT
5019-38670-0021 FEELING NO SORT OF INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT SHE TOOK THE SHORTER WAY OF MAKING HER PEACE WITH HIM SHE TOOK OUT HER PURSE LET ME MAKE YOU A PRESENT OF THE GLOVES SHE SAID WITH HER IRRESISTIBLE SMILE
5019-38670-0022 JACK LOST ALL HIS DIGNITY IN AN INSTANT HE LEAPT OFF THE WINDOW SEAT AND SNATCHED AT THE MONEY LIKE A FAMISHED ANIMAL SNATCHING AT A PIECE OF MEAT MISSUS WAGNER CAUGHT HIM BY THE ARM AND LOOKED AT HIM HE LIFTED HIS EYES TO HERS
5019-38670-0023 THEN LOWERED THEM AGAIN AS IF HE WAS ASHAMED OF HIMSELF OH TO BE SURE HE SAID I HAVE FORGOTTEN MY MANNERS I HAVEN'T SAID THANK YOU A LAPSE OF MEMORY I SUPPOSE THANK YOU MISSUS HOUSEKEEPER
5019-38670-0024 IN A MOMENT MORE HE AND HIS BAG WERE ON THEIR WAY TO THE FASHIONABLE QUARTER OF THE TOWN YOU WILL MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR MY POOR LITTLE JACK I AM SURE SAID MISSUS WAGNER MY DEAR MADAM JACK AMUSES ME
5019-38670-0025 I HAVE CURED HIM OF ALL THE WORST RESULTS OF HIS CRUEL IMPRISONMENT IN THE MAD HOUSE SHE WENT ON BUT HIS HARMLESS VANITY SEEMS TO BE INBRED I CAN DO NOTHING WITH HIM ON THAT SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER HE IS PROUD OF BEING TRUSTED WITH
5019-38670-0026 ANYTHING ESPECIALLY WITH KEYS AND HE HAS BEEN KEPT WAITING FOR THEM WHILE I HAD FAR MORE IMPORTANT MATTERS TO OCCUPY ME
5019-38670-0027 OF COURSE YOU DON'T TRUST HIM SAID MADAME FONTAINE WITH KEYS THAT ARE OF ANY IMPORTANCE
5019-38670-0028 MISSUS WAGNER'S STEADY GRAY EYES BEGAN TO BRIGHTEN I CAN TRUST HIM WITH ANYTHING SHE ANSWERED EMPHATICALLY MADAME FONTAINE
5019-38670-0029 ARCHED HER HANDSOME BROWS IN A MUTELY POLITE EXPRESSION OF EXTREME SURPRISE IN MY EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD MISSUS WAGNER WENT ON I HAVE FOUND THAT THE RAREST OF ALL HUMAN VIRTUES
5019-38670-0030 IS THE VIRTUE OF GRATITUDE IN A HUNDRED LITTLE WAYS MY POOR FRIENDLESS JACK HAS SHOWN ME THAT HE IS GRATEFUL TO MY MIND THAT IS REASON ENOUGH FOR TRUSTING HIM WITH MONEY
5019-38670-0031 THE WIDOW INQUIRED CERTAINLY IN LONDON I TRUSTED HIM WITH MONEY WITH THE HAPPIEST RESULTS I QUIETED HIS MIND BY AN APPEAL TO HIS SENSE OF TRUST AND SELF RESPECT WHICH HE THOROUGHLY APPRECIATED
5019-38670-0032 AS YET I HAVE NOT GIVEN HIM THE KEY OF MY DESK HERE BECAUSE I RESERVE IT AS A SPECIAL REWARD FOR GOOD CONDUCT IN A FEW DAYS MORE I HAVE NO DOUBT HE WILL ADD IT TO THE COLLECTION IN HIS BAG AH SAID MADAME FONTAINE
5019-38670-0033 WITH THE HUMILITY WHICH NO LIVING WOMAN KNEW BETTER WHEN AND HOW TO ASSUME YOU UNDERSTAND THESE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS YOU HAVE YOUR GRAND NATIONAL COMMON SENSE I AM ONLY A POOR LIMITED GERMAN WOMAN
5019-38670-0034 BUT AS YOU SAY IN ENGLAND LIVE AND LEARN YOU HAVE INDESCRIBABLY INTERESTED ME GOOD MORNING SHE LEFT THE ROOM HATEFUL WOMAN SHE SAID IN HER OWN LANGUAGE ON THE OUTER SIDE OF THE DOOR
5019-38670-0035 HUMBUG SAID MISSUS WAGNER IN HER LANGUAGE ON THE INNER SIDE OF THE DOOR IF THERE HAD BEEN MORE SYMPATHY BETWEEN THE TWO LADIES OR IF MADAME FONTAINE HAD FELT A LITTLE CURIOSITY ON THE SUBJECT OF CRAZY JACK'S KEYS
5019-38670-0036 SHE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN AWAY WITH HER SOME VALUABLE MATERIALS FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION AS IT WAS MISSUS WAGNER HAD NOT TROUBLED HER WITH ANY DETAILED NARRATIVE
5019-38670-0037 IN LONDON SHE HAD BEGUN CAUTIOUSLY BY ONLY GIVING HIM SOME OF THE USELESS OLD KEYS WHICH ACCUMULATE ABOUT A HOUSE IN COURSE OF YEARS WHEN THE NOVELTY OF MERELY KEEPING THEM HAD WORN OFF
5019-38670-0038 AND HAD FLATTERED HIS PRIDE BY ASKING HIM TO OPEN THE BOX OR THE DESK FOR HER AS THE CASE MIGHT BE PROCEEDING ON THE SAME WISELY GRADUAL PLAN AT FRANKFORT SHE HAD ASKED MISTER KELLER TO HELP HER
5019-38670-0039 AND HAD BEEN TAKEN BY HIM WHILE JACK WAS OUT OF THE WAY TO A LUMBER ROOM IN THE BASEMENT OF THE HOUSE ON THE FLOOR OF WHICH SEVERAL OLD KEYS WERE LYING ABOUT TAKE AS MANY AS YOU LIKE HE HAD SAID
5019-38670-0040 AND THEY MIGHT BE SOLD FOR OLD IRON IF THERE WERE ONLY ENOUGH OF THEM MISSUS WAGNER HAD PICKED UP THE FIRST SIX KEYS THAT PRESENTED THEMSELVES
5019-38670-0041 HE FOUND NO FAULT WITH THEM FOR BEING RUSTY ON THE CONTRARY HE LOOKED FORWARD WITH DELIGHT TO THE ENJOYMENT OF CLEANING AWAY THE RUST THEY SHALL BE AS BRIGHT AS DIAMONDS
5019-38670-0042 BEFORE I HAVE DONE WITH THEM AND WHAT DID MADAME FONTAINE LOSE BY FAILING TO INFORM HERSELF OF SUCH TRIFLES AS THESE
