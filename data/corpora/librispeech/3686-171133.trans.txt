3686-171133-0000 THE CALAMITIES AND SLAUGHTERS THAT CAME UPON THE JEWS ONE
3686-171133-0001 ON THE VERY SAME DAY AND HOUR WHEN THE SOLDIERS WERE SLAIN WHICH ONE WOULD THINK MUST HAVE COME TO PASS BY THE DIRECTION OF PROVIDENCE INSOMUCH THAT IN ONE HOUR'S TIME ABOVE TWENTY THOUSAND JEWS WERE KILLED
3686-171133-0002 FOR FLORUS CAUGHT SUCH AS RAN AWAY AND SENT THEM IN BONDS TO THE GALLEYS
3686-171133-0003 SO THEY DIVIDED THEMSELVES INTO SEVERAL PARTIES AND LAID WASTE THE VILLAGES OF THE SYRIANS AND THEIR NEIGHBORING CITIES PHILADELPHIA AND SEBONITIS AND GERASA AND PELLA
3686-171133-0004 AND FALLING UPON GAULONITIS SOME CITIES THEY DESTROYED THERE AND SOME THEY SET ON FIRE AND THEN WENT TO KEDASA BELONGING TO THE TYRIANS
3686-171133-0005 TWO HOWEVER THE SYRIANS WERE EVEN WITH THE JEWS IN THE MULTITUDE OF THE MEN WHOM THEY SLEW FOR THEY KILLED THOSE WHOM THEY CAUGHT IN THEIR CITIES AND THAT NOT ONLY OUT OF THE HATRED THEY BARE THEM AS FORMERLY
3686-171133-0006 BUT TO PREVENT THE DANGER UNDER WHICH THEY WERE FROM THEM SO THAT THE DISORDERS IN ALL SYRIA WERE TERRIBLE AND EVERY CITY WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO ARMIES
3686-171133-0007 AND THE PRESERVATION OF THE ONE PARTY WAS IN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE OTHER SO THE DAY TIME WAS SPENT IN SHEDDING OF BLOOD AND THE NIGHT IN FEAR WHICH WAS OF THE TWO THE MORE TERRIBLE FOR WHEN THE SYRIANS THOUGHT THEY HAD RUINED THE JEWS
3686-171133-0008 THEY HAD THE JUDAIZERS IN SUSPICION ALSO AND AS EACH SIDE DID NOT CARE TO SLAY THOSE WHOM THEY ONLY SUSPECTED ON THE OTHER SO DID THEY GREATLY FEAR THEM WHEN THEY WERE MINGLED WITH THE OTHER AS IF THEY WERE CERTAINLY FOREIGNERS
3686-171133-0009 MOREOVER GREEDINESS OF GAIN WAS A PROVOCATION TO KILL THE OPPOSITE PARTY EVEN TO SUCH AS HAD OF OLD APPEARED VERY MILD AND GENTLE TOWARDS THEM FOR THEY WITHOUT FEAR PLUNDERED THE EFFECTS OF THE SLAIN
3686-171133-0010 IT WAS THEN COMMON TO SEE CITIES FILLED WITH DEAD BODIES STILL LYING UNBURIED AND THOSE OF OLD MEN MIXED WITH INFANTS ALL DEAD AND SCATTERED ABOUT TOGETHER
3686-171133-0011 YOU MIGHT THEN SEE THE WHOLE PROVINCE FULL OF INEXPRESSIBLE CALAMITIES WHILE THE DREAD OF STILL MORE BARBAROUS PRACTICES WHICH WERE THREATENED
3686-171133-0012 THREE AND THUS FAR THE CONFLICT HAD BEEN BETWEEN JEWS AND FOREIGNERS BUT WHEN THEY MADE EXCURSIONS TO SCYTHOPOLIS
3686-171133-0013 FOR AS THEY STOOD IN BATTLE ARRAY WITH THOSE OF SCYTHOPOLIS AND PREFERRED THEIR OWN SAFETY BEFORE THEIR RELATION TO US THEY FOUGHT AGAINST THEIR OWN COUNTRYMEN NAY THEIR ALACRITY WAS SO VERY GREAT THAT THOSE OF SCYTHOPOLIS SUSPECTED THEM
3686-171133-0014 THESE WERE AFRAID THEREFORE LEST THEY SHOULD MAKE AN ASSAULT UPON THE CITY IN THE NIGHT TIME AND TO THEIR GREAT MISFORTUNE SHOULD THEREBY MAKE AN APOLOGY FOR THEMSELVES TO THEIR OWN PEOPLE FOR THEIR REVOLT FROM THEM
3686-171133-0015 SO THEY COMMANDED THEM THAT IN CASE THEY WOULD CONFIRM THEIR AGREEMENT AND DEMONSTRATE THEIR FIDELITY TO THEM WHO WERE OF A DIFFERENT NATION THEY SHOULD GO OUT OF THE CITY WITH THEIR FAMILIES TO A NEIGHBORING GROVE
3686-171133-0016 AND WHEN THEY HAD DONE AS THEY WERE COMMANDED WITHOUT SUSPECTING ANY THING THE PEOPLE OF SCYTHOPOLIS LAY STILL FOR THE INTERVAL OF TWO DAYS TO TEMPT THEM TO BE SECURE BUT ON THE THIRD NIGHT THEY WATCHED THEIR OPPORTUNITY AND CUT ALL THEIR THROATS
3686-171133-0017 SOME AS THEY LAY UNGUARDED AND SOME AS THEY LAY ASLEEP THE NUMBER THAT WAS SLAIN WAS ABOVE THIRTEEN THOUSAND
3686-171133-0018 FOUR IT WILL DESERVE OUR RELATION WHAT BEFELL SIMON HE WAS THE SON OF ONE SAUL A MAN OF REPUTATION AMONG THE JEWS THIS MAN WAS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE REST BY THE STRENGTH OF HIS BODY AND THE BOLDNESS OF HIS CONDUCT
3686-171133-0019 ALTHOUGH HE ABUSED THEM BOTH TO THE MISCHIEVING OF HIS COUNTRYMEN
3686-171133-0020 AND HE FREQUENTLY PUT THEM TO FLIGHT AND BECAME HIMSELF ALONE THE CAUSE OF HIS ARMY'S CONQUERING BUT A JUST PUNISHMENT OVERTOOK HIM FOR THE MURDERS HE HAD COMMITTED UPON THOSE OF THE SAME NATION WITH HIM FOR WHEN THE PEOPLE OF SCYTHOPOLIS THREW THEIR DARTS AT THEM IN THE GROVE
3686-171133-0021 FOR HE SAW THAT HE COULD DO NOTHING AGAINST SUCH A MULTITUDE BUT HE CRIED OUT AFTER A VERY MOVING MANNER AND SAID O YOU PEOPLE OF SCYTHOPOLIS I DESERVEDLY SUFFER FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH RELATION TO YOU WHEN I GAVE YOU SUCH SECURITY OF MY FIDELITY TO YOU
3686-171133-0022 BY SLAYING SO MANY OF THOSE THAT WERE RELATED TO ME WHEREFORE WE VERY JUSTLY EXPERIENCE THE PERFIDIOUSNESS OF FOREIGNERS WHILE WE ACTED AFTER A MOST WICKED MANNER AGAINST OUR OWN NATION
3686-171133-0023 AND LET THE SAME ACTION BE TO ME BOTH A PUNISHMENT FOR MY GREAT CRIMES AND A TESTIMONY OF MY COURAGE TO MY COMMENDATION THAT SO NO ONE OF OUR ENEMIES MAY HAVE IT TO BRAG OF THAT HE IT WAS THAT SLEW ME
3686-171133-0024 AND NO ONE MAY INSULT UPON ME AS I FALL NOW WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS HE LOOKED ROUND ABOUT HIM UPON HIS FAMILY WITH EYES OF COMMISERATION AND OF RAGE THAT FAMILY CONSISTED OF A WIFE AND CHILDREN AND HIS AGED PARENTS
3686-171133-0025 SO IN THE FIRST PLACE HE CAUGHT HIS FATHER BY HIS GREY HAIRS AND RAN HIS SWORD THROUGH HIM AND AFTER HIM HE DID THE SAME TO HIS MOTHER WHO WILLINGLY RECEIVED IT AND AFTER THEM HE DID THE LIKE TO HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN
3686-171133-0026 EVERY ONE ALMOST OFFERING THEMSELVES TO HIS SWORD AS DESIROUS TO PREVENT BEING SLAIN BY THEIR ENEMIES SO WHEN HE HAD GONE OVER ALL HIS FAMILY HE STOOD UPON THEIR BODIES TO BE SEEN BY ALL AND STRETCHING OUT HIS RIGHT HAND
3686-171133-0027 THAT HIS ACTION MIGHT BE OBSERVED BY ALL HE SHEATHED HIS ENTIRE SWORD INTO HIS OWN BOWELS THIS YOUNG MAN WAS TO BE PITIED ON ACCOUNT OF THE STRENGTH OF HIS BODY AND THE COURAGE OF HIS SOUL BUT SINCE HE HAD ASSURED FOREIGNERS OF HIS FIDELITY
3686-171133-0028 AGAINST HIS OWN COUNTRYMEN HE SUFFERED DESERVEDLY FIVE BESIDES THIS MURDER AT SCYTHOPOLIS THE OTHER CITIES ROSE UP AGAINST THE JEWS THAT WERE AMONG THEM THOSE OF ASKELON SLEW TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED
3686-171133-0029 AND THOSE OF PTOLEMAIS TWO THOUSAND AND PUT NOT A FEW INTO BONDS THOSE OF TYRE ALSO PUT A GREAT NUMBER TO DEATH BUT KEPT A GREATER NUMBER IN PRISON
3686-171133-0030 AND APAMIANS SPARED THOSE THAT DWELT WITH THEM AND WOULD NOT ENDURE EITHER TO KILL ANY OF THE JEWS OR TO PUT THEM IN BONDS
3686-171133-0031 THEY DID NO HARM TO THOSE THAT ABODE WITH THEM AND FOR THOSE WHO HAD A MIND TO GO AWAY THEY CONDUCTED THEM AS FAR AS THEIR BORDERS REACHED SIX THERE WAS ALSO A PLOT LAID AGAINST THE JEWS IN AGRIPPA'S KINGDOM
3686-171133-0032 TO ANTIOCH BUT HAD LEFT ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS WHOSE NAME WAS NOARUS TO TAKE CARE OF THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS WHICH NOARUS WAS OF KIN TO KING SOHEMUS
3686-171133-0033 THESE DESIRED TO HAVE AN ARMY PUT INTO THEIR HANDS THAT IF ANY TUMULT SHOULD HAPPEN THEY MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THEM A GUARD SUFFICIENT TO RESTRAIN SUCH AS MIGHT RISE UP AGAINST THEM THIS NOARUS SENT OUT SOME OF THE KING'S ARMED MEN BY NIGHT
3686-171133-0034 AND SLEW ALL THOSE SEVENTY MEN WHICH BOLD ACTION HE VENTURED UPON WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF AGRIPPA AND WAS SUCH A LOVER OF MONEY THAT HE CHOSE TO BE SO WICKED TO HIS OWN COUNTRYMEN THOUGH HE BROUGHT RUIN ON THE KINGDOM THEREBY
3686-171133-0035 AND THUS CRUELLY DID HE TREAT THAT NATION AND THIS CONTRARY TO THE LAWS ALSO UNTIL AGRIPPA WAS INFORMED OF IT WHO DID NOT INDEED DARE TO PUT HIM TO DEATH OUT OF REGARD TO SOHEMUS BUT STILL HE PUT AN END TO HIS PROCURATORSHIP IMMEDIATELY
3686-171133-0036 PERSUADED THE ROMANS WHO WERE IN GARRISON TO LEAVE THE PLACE AND DELIVER IT UP TO THEM THESE ROMANS BEING IN GREAT FEAR LEST THE PLACE SHOULD BE TAKEN BY FORCE MADE AN AGREEMENT WITH THEM TO DEPART UPON CERTAIN CONDITIONS
3686-171133-0037 AND WHEN THEY HAD OBTAINED THE SECURITY THEY DESIRED THEY DELIVERED UP THE CITADEL INTO WHICH THE PEOPLE OF MACHAERUS PUT A GARRISON FOR THEIR OWN SECURITY AND HELD IT IN THEIR OWN POWER SEVEN BUT FOR ALEXANDRIA
3686-171133-0038 THE SEDITION OF THE PEOPLE OF THE PLACE AGAINST THE JEWS WAS PERPETUAL AND THIS FROM THAT VERY TIME WHEN ALEXANDER THE GREAT UPON FINDING THE READINESS OF THE JEWS IN ASSISTING HIM AGAINST THE EGYPTIANS
3686-171133-0039 GAVE THEM EQUAL PRIVILEGES IN THIS CITY WITH THE GRECIANS THEMSELVES WHICH HONORARY REWARD CONTINUED AMONG THEM UNDER HIS SUCCESSORS WHO ALSO SET APART FOR THEM A PARTICULAR PLACE THAT THEY MIGHT LIVE WITHOUT BEING POLLUTED BY THE GENTILES
3686-171133-0040 THEY ALSO GAVE THEM THIS FURTHER PRIVILEGE THAT THEY SHOULD BE CALLED MACEDONIANS NAY WHEN THE ROMANS GOT POSSESSION OF EGYPT NEITHER THE FIRST CAESAR NOR ANY ONE THAT CAME AFTER HIM
3686-171133-0041 THOUGHT OF DIMINISHING THE HONORS WHICH ALEXANDER HAD BESTOWED ON THE JEWS BUT STILL CONFLICTS PERPETUALLY AROSE WITH THE GRECIANS AND ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNORS DID EVERY DAY PUNISH MANY OF THEM YET DID THE SEDITION GROW WORSE BUT AT THIS TIME ESPECIALLY
3686-171133-0042 A GREAT NUMBER OF JEWS CAME FLOCKING TO THE THEATER BUT WHEN THEIR ADVERSARIES SAW THEM THEY IMMEDIATELY CRIED OUT AND CALLED THEM THEIR ENEMIES AND SAID THEY CAME AS SPIES UPON THEM UPON WHICH THEY RUSHED OUT AND LAID VIOLENT HANDS UPON THEM
3686-171133-0043 AND AS FOR THE REST THEY WERE SLAIN AS THEY RAN AWAY BUT THERE WERE THREE MEN WHOM THEY CAUGHT AND HAULED THEM ALONG IN ORDER TO HAVE THEM BURNT ALIVE BUT ALL THE JEWS CAME IN A BODY TO DEFEND THEM WHO AT FIRST THREW STONES AT THE GRECIANS
3686-171133-0044 BUT AFTER THAT THEY TOOK LAMPS AND RUSHED WITH VIOLENCE INTO THE THEATER AND THREATENED THAT THEY WOULD BURN THE PEOPLE TO A MAN AND THIS THEY HAD SOON DONE UNLESS TIBERIUS ALEXANDER THE GOVERNOR OF THE CITY HAD RESTRAINED THEIR PASSIONS
3686-171133-0045 HOWEVER THIS MAN DID NOT BEGIN TO TEACH THEM WISDOM BY ARMS BUT SENT AMONG THEM PRIVATELY SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL MEN AND THEREBY ENTREATED THEM TO BE QUIET AND NOT PROVOKE THE ROMAN ARMY AGAINST THEM
3686-171133-0046 BUT THE SEDITIOUS MADE A JEST OF THE ENTREATIES OF TIBERIUS AND REPROACHED HIM FOR SO DOING EIGHT NOW WHEN HE PERCEIVED THAT THOSE WHO WERE FOR INNOVATIONS WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED TILL SOME GREAT CALAMITY SHOULD OVERTAKE THEM
3686-171133-0047 HE SENT OUT UPON THEM THOSE TWO ROMAN LEGIONS THAT WERE IN THE CITY AND TOGETHER WITH THEM FIVE THOUSAND OTHER SOLDIERS WHO BY CHANCE WERE COME TOGETHER OUT OF LIBYA TO THE RUIN OF THE JEWS
3686-171133-0048 THEY WERE ALSO PERMITTED NOT ONLY TO KILL THEM BUT TO PLUNDER THEM OF WHAT THEY HAD AND TO SET FIRE TO THEIR HOUSES THESE SOLDIERS RUSHED VIOLENTLY INTO THAT PART OF THE CITY THAT WAS CALLED DELTA WHERE THE JEWISH PEOPLE LIVED TOGETHER AND DID AS THEY WERE BIDDEN
3686-171133-0049 THOUGH NOT WITHOUT BLOODSHED ON THEIR OWN SIDE ALSO FOR THE JEWS GOT TOGETHER AND SET THOSE THAT WERE THE BEST ARMED AMONG THEM IN THE FOREFRONT AND MADE A RESISTANCE FOR A GREAT WHILE BUT WHEN ONCE THEY GAVE BACK THEY WERE DESTROYED UNMERCIFULLY
3686-171133-0050 WHICH HOUSES WERE FIRST PLUNDERED OF WHAT WAS IN THEM AND THEN SET ON FIRE BY THE ROMANS WHEREIN NO MERCY WAS SHOWN TO THE INFANTS AND NO REGARD HAD TO THE AGED
3686-171133-0051 OF EVERY AGE TILL ALL THE PLACE WAS OVERFLOWED WITH BLOOD AND FIFTY THOUSAND OF THEM LAY DEAD UPON HEAPS NOR HAD THE REMAINDER BEEN PRESERVED HAD THEY NOT BE TAKEN THEMSELVES TO SUPPLICATION SO ALEXANDER COMMISERATED THEIR CONDITION
3686-171133-0052 AND GAVE ORDERS TO THE ROMANS TO RETIRE ACCORDINGLY THESE BEING ACCUSTOMED TO OBEY ORDERS LEFT OFF KILLING AT THE FIRST INTIMATION BUT THE POPULACE OF ALEXANDRIA BARE SO VERY GREAT HATRED TO THE JEWS
3686-171133-0053 AND IT WAS A HARD THING TO MAKE THEM LEAVE THEIR DEAD BODIES NINE AND THIS WAS THE MISERABLE CALAMITY WHICH AT THIS TIME BEFELL THE JEWS AT ALEXANDRIA
3686-171133-0054 WHILE THE JEWS WERE EVERYWHERE UP IN ARMS SO HE TOOK OUT OF ANTIOCH THE TWELFTH LEGION ENTIRE AND OUT OF EACH OF THE REST HE SELECTED TWO THOUSAND WITH SIX COHORTS OF FOOTMEN AND FOUR TROOPS OF HORSEMEN
3686-171133-0055 BESIDES THOSE AUXILIARIES WHICH WERE SENT BY THE KINGS
3686-171133-0056 AND THREE THOUSAND FOOTMEN WITH AS MANY ARCHERS AND AGRIPPA SENT THE SAME NUMBER OF FOOTMEN AND ONE THOUSAND HORSEMEN SOHEMUS ALSO FOLLOWED WITH FOUR THOUSAND A THIRD PART WHEREOF WERE HORSEMEN BUT MOST PART WERE ARCHERS
3686-171133-0057 AND THUS DID HE MARCH TO PTOLEMAIS
3686-171133-0058 WHO INDEED HAD NOT THE SAME SKILL IN MARTIAL AFFAIRS BUT MADE UP IN THEIR ALACRITY AND IN THEIR HATRED TO THE JEWS WHAT THEY WANTED IN SKILL THERE CAME ALSO ALONG WITH CESTIUS AGRIPPA HIMSELF BOTH AS A GUIDE IN HIS MARCH OVER THE COUNTRY
3686-171133-0059 AND A DIRECTOR WHAT WAS FIT TO BE DONE
3686-171133-0060 AND MARCHED HASTILY TO ZABULON A STRONG CITY OF GALILEE WHICH WAS CALLED THE CITY OF MEN AND DIVIDES THE COUNTRY OF PTOLEMAIS FROM OUR NATION THIS HE FOUND DESERTED BY ITS MEN THE MULTITUDE HAVING FLED TO THE MOUNTAINS
3686-171133-0061 BUT FULL OF ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS THOSE HE GAVE LEAVE TO THE SOLDIERS TO PLUNDER AND SET FIRE TO THE CITY ALTHOUGH IT WAS OF ADMIRABLE BEAUTY AND HAD ITS HOUSES BUILT LIKE THOSE IN TYRE AND SIDON AND BERYTUS
3686-171133-0062 AFTER THIS HE OVERRAN ALL THE COUNTRY AND SEIZED UPON WHATSOEVER CAME IN HIS WAY AND SET FIRE TO THE VILLAGES THAT WERE ROUND ABOUT THEM AND THEN RETURNED TO PTOLEMAIS BUT WHEN THE SYRIANS AND ESPECIALLY THOSE OF BERYTUS WERE BUSY IN PLUNDERING
3686-171133-0063 AND FELL UPON THOSE THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND UNEXPECTEDLY AND DESTROYED ABOUT TWO THOUSAND OF THEM
3686-171133-0064 AND GAVE ORDER THAT IF THEY COULD TAKE THAT CITY BY SURPRISE THEY SHOULD KEEP IT BUT THAT IN CASE THE CITIZENS SHOULD PERCEIVE THEY WERE COMING TO ATTACK THEM
3686-171133-0065 THAT THEY THEN SHOULD STAY FOR HIM AND FOR THE REST OF THE ARMY SO SOME OF THEM MADE A BRISK MARCH BY THE SEA SIDE AND SOME BY LAND AND SO COMING UPON THEM ON BOTH SIDES THEY TOOK THE CITY WITH EASE AND AS THE INHABITANTS
3686-171133-0066 NOR HAD GOTTEN ANY THING READY FOR FIGHTING THE SOLDIERS FELL UPON THEM AND SLEW THEM ALL WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND THEN PLUNDERED AND BURNT THE CITY THE NUMBER OF THE SLAIN WAS EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED IN LIKE MANNER
3686-171133-0067 TO THE TOPARCHY OF NARBATENE
3686-171133-0068 WHO DESTROYED THE COUNTRY AND SLEW A GREAT MULTITUDE OF ITS PEOPLE
3686-171133-0069 THE COMMANDER OF THE TWELFTH LEGION INTO GALILEE AND DELIVERED TO HIM AS MANY OF HIS FORCES AS HE SUPPOSED SUFFICIENT TO SUBDUE THAT NATION HE WAS RECEIVED BY THE STRONGEST CITY OF GALILEE WHICH WAS SEPPHORIS WITH ACCLAMATIONS OF JOY
3686-171133-0070 WHICH WISE CONDUCT OF THAT CITY OCCASIONED THE REST OF THE CITIES TO BE IN QUIET WHILE THE SEDITIOUS PART AND THE ROBBERS RAN AWAY TO THAT MOUNTAIN WHICH LIES IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF GALILEE AND IS SITUATED OVER AGAINST SEPPHORIS IT IS CALLED ASAMON
3686-171133-0071 SO GALLUS BROUGHT HIS FORCES AGAINST THEM BUT WHILE THOSE MEN WERE IN THE SUPERIOR PARTS ABOVE THE ROMANS THEY EASILY THREW THEIR DARTS UPON THE ROMANS AS THEY MADE THEIR APPROACHES AND SLEW ABOUT TWO HUNDRED OF THEM BUT WHEN THE ROMANS HAD GONE ROUND THE MOUNTAINS
3686-171133-0072 AND WERE GOTTEN INTO THE PARTS ABOVE THEIR ENEMIES THE OTHERS WERE SOON BEATEN NOR COULD THEY WHO HAD ONLY LIGHT ARMOR ON SUSTAIN THE FORCE OF THEM THAT FOUGHT THEM ARMED ALL OVER NOR WHEN THEY WERE BEATEN COULD THEY ESCAPE THE ENEMIES HORSEMEN
3686-171133-0073 AMONG THE MOUNTAINS WHILE THE REST
