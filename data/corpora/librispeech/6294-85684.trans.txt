6294-85684-0000 CONCEIVABLY IF IN THE COMING YEARS A DELIBERATE ATTEMPT WERE MADE TO PROVIDE SOUND INSTRUCTION IN ENGLISH TO ALL WHO SOUGHT IT AND TO ALL WITHIN THE CONTROL OF ENGLISH SPEAKING GOVERNMENTS IF HONOUR AND EMOLUMENT WERE GIVEN TO LITERARY MEN INSTEAD OF BEING LEFT TO THEM TO MOST INDELICATELY TAKE
6294-85684-0001 AND IF THE PRESENT SORDID TRADE OF PUBLISHING WERE SO LIFTED AS TO BRING THE WHOLE LITERATURE THE WHOLE SCIENCE AND ALL THE CONTEMPORARY THOUGHT OF THE WORLD NOT SOME SELECTION OF THE WORLD'S LITERATURE NOT SOME OBSOLETE ENCYCLOPAEDIA SOLD MEANLY AND BASELY TO CHOKE HUNGRY MINDS
6294-85684-0002 BUT A REAL PUBLICATION OF ALL THAT HAS BEEN AND IS BEING DONE WITHIN THE REACH OF EACH MAN'S NEED AND DESIRE WHO HAD THE FRANCHISE OF THE TONGUE
6294-85684-0003 AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT IT MIGHT BE THE PREVALENT AND EVERYDAY LANGUAGE OF SCANDINAVIA AND DENMARK AND HOLLAND OF ALL AFRICA ALL NORTH AMERICA OF THE PACIFIC COASTS OF ASIA AND OF INDIA THE UNIVERSAL INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE
6294-85684-0004 AND IN A FAIR WAY TO BE THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE OF MANKIND BUT SUCH AN ENTERPRISE DEMANDS A RESOLVE AND INTELLIGENCE BEYOND ALL THE IMMEDIATE SIGNS OF THE TIMES IT IMPLIES A VERITABLE RENASCENCE OF INTELLECTUAL LIFE AMONG THE ENGLISH SPEAKING PEOPLES
6294-85684-0005 BUT HERE IT IS CLEAR THAT UPON THE PROBABILITY OF SUCH A RENASCENCE DEPENDS THE EXTENSION OF THE LANGUAGE AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE PRESERVATION OF THAT MILITARY AND NAVAL EFFICIENCY UPON WHICH IN THIS WORLD OF RESOLUTE AGGRESSION THE EXISTENCE OF THE ENGLISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES FINALLY DEPENDS
6294-85684-0006 FRENCH AND GERMAN WILL CERTAINLY BE AGGREGATING LANGUAGES DURING THE GREATER PORTION OF THE COMING YEARS OF THE TWO I AM INCLINED TO THINK FRENCH WILL SPREAD FURTHER THAN GERMAN THERE IS A DISPOSITION IN THE WORLD WHICH THE FRENCH SHARE
6294-85684-0007 TO GROSSLY UNDERVALUE THE PROSPECTS OF ALL THINGS FRENCH DERIVED SO FAR AS I CAN GATHER FROM THE FACTS THAT THE FRENCH WERE BEATEN BY THE GERMANS IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY AND THAT THEY DO NOT BREED WITH THE ABANDON OF RABBITS OR NEGROES THESE ARE CONSIDERATIONS THAT AFFECT THE DISSEMINATION OF FRENCH VERY LITTLE
6294-85684-0008 THE FRENCH READING PUBLIC IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND VERY MUCH LARGER THAN THE EXISTING FRENCH POLITICAL SYSTEM THE NUMBER OF BOOKS PUBLISHED IN FRENCH IS GREATER THAN THAT PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH
6294-85684-0009 AND THE FRENCH TRANSLATORS ARE THE MOST ALERT AND EFFICIENT IN THE WORLD ONE HAS ONLY TO SEE A PARISIAN BOOKSHOP AND TO RECALL AN ENGLISH ONE TO REALIZE THE AS YET UNATTAINABLE STANDING OF FRENCH
6294-85684-0010 THE SERRIED RANKS OF LEMON COLOURED VOLUMES IN THE FORMER HAVE THE WHOLE RANGE OF HUMAN THOUGHT AND INTEREST THERE ARE NO TABOOS AND NO LIMITS YOU HAVE EVERYTHING UP AND DOWN THE SCALE FROM FRANK INDECENCY TO STARK WISDOM IT IS A SHOP FOR MEN
6294-85684-0011 WITH ITS GAUDY REACH ME DOWNS OF GILDED AND EMBOSSED COVER ITS HORRIBLY PRINTED NOVELS
6294-85684-0012 HONESTLY SORRY THE THING IS A BOOK BUT WHO HAS DONE HIS BEST TO REMEDY IT ANYHOW AND ALL THE ENGLISH SHOPFUL IS EITHER BRAND NEW FICTION OR ILLUSTRATED TRAVEL OF BUNS WITH THE GRAND LAMA TYPE
6294-85684-0013 OR GILDED VERSIONS OF THE CLASSICS OF PAST TIMES DONE UP TO GIVE AWAY WHILE THE FRENCH BOOKSHOP REEKS OF CONTEMPORARY INTELLECTUAL LIFE THESE THINGS COUNT FOR FRENCH AS AGAINST ENGLISH NOW AND THEY WILL COUNT FOR INFINITELY MORE IN THE COMING YEARS
6294-85684-0014 AND OVER GERMAN ALSO FRENCH HAS MANY ADVANTAGES IN SPITE OF THE NUMERICAL PREPONDERANCE OF BOOKS PUBLISHED IN GERMANY IT IS DOUBTFUL IF THE GERMAN READER HAS QUITE SUCH A CATHOLIC FEAST BEFORE HIM AS THE READER OF FRENCH THERE IS A MASS OF GERMAN FICTION
6294-85684-0015 PROBABLY AS UNINTERESTING TO A FOREIGNER AS POPULAR ENGLISH AND AMERICAN ROMANCE AND GERMAN COMPARED WITH FRENCH IS AN UNATTRACTIVE LANGUAGE UNMELODIOUS UNWIELDY
6294-85684-0016 AND CURSED WITH A HIDEOUS AND BLINDING LETTERING THAT THE GERMAN IS TOO PATRIOTIC TO SACRIFICE THERE HAS BEEN IN GERMANY A MORE POWERFUL PARALLEL TO WHAT ONE MAY CALL THE HONEST SAXON MOVEMENT AMONG THE ENGLISH
6294-85684-0017 THAT QUEER MENTAL TWIST THAT MOVES MEN TO CALL AN OTHERWISE UNDISTINGUISHED PREFACE A FOREWORD AND FIND A PLEASURABLE ADVANTAGE OVER THEIR FELLOW CREATURES IN A FAMILIARITY WITH EFTSOONS THIS TENDENCY IN GERMAN HAS DONE MUCH TO ARREST THE SIMPLIFICATION OF IDIOM
6294-85684-0018 AND CHECKED THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW WORDS OF CLASSICAL ORIGIN IN PARTICULAR IT HAS STOOD IN THE WAY OF THE INTERNATIONAL USE OF SCIENTIFIC TERMS THE ENGLISHMAN THE FRENCHMAN AND THE ITALIAN HAVE A CERTAIN COMMUNITY OF TECHNICAL SCIENTIFIC AND PHILOSOPHICAL PHRASEOLOGY
6294-85684-0019 AND IT IS FREQUENTLY EASIER FOR AN ENGLISHMAN WITH SOME SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE OF HIS SUBJECT TO READ AND APPRECIATE A SUBTLE AND TECHNICAL WORK IN FRENCH THAN IT IS FOR HIM TO FULLY ENTER INTO THE POPULAR MATTER OF THE SAME TONGUE
6294-85684-0020 MOREOVER THE TECHNICALITIES OF THESE PEOPLES BEING NOT SO IMMEDIATELY AND CONSTANTLY BROUGHT INTO CONTRAST AND CONTACT WITH THEIR LATIN OR GREEK ROOTS AS THEY WOULD BE IF THEY WERE DERIVED AS ARE SO MANY PATRIOTIC GERMAN TECHNICALITIES
6294-85684-0021 FROM NATIVE ROOTS ARE FREE TO QUALIFY AND DEVELOP A FINAL MEANING DISTINCT FROM THEIR ORIGINAL INTENTION IN THE GROWING AND CHANGING BODY OF SCIENCE THIS COUNTS FOR MUCH
6294-85684-0022 THE INDIGENOUS GERMAN TECHNICALITY REMAINS CLUMSY AND COMPROMISED BY ITS EVERYDAY RELATIONS TO THE END OF TIME IT DRAGS A LENGTHENING CHAIN OF UNSUITABLE ASSOCIATIONS AND THE SHADE OF MEANING
6294-85684-0023 THE LIMITED QUALIFICATION THAT A FRENCHMAN OR ENGLISHMAN CAN ATTAIN WITH A MERE TWIST OF THE SENTENCE THE GERMAN MUST EITHER ABANDON OR LABORIOUSLY OVERSTATE WITH SOME COLOSSAL WORMCAST OF PARENTHESIS
6294-85684-0024 MOREOVER AGAINST THE GERMAN TONGUE THERE ARE HOSTILE FRONTIERS THERE ARE HOSTILE PEOPLE WHO FEAR GERMAN PREPONDERANCE AND WHO HAVE SET THEIR HEARTS AGAINST ITS USE IN ROUMANIA AND AMONG THE SLAV BOHEMIAN AND HUNGARIAN PEOPLES
6294-85684-0025 FRENCH ATTACKS GERMAN IN THE FLANK AND HAS AS CLEAR A PROSPECT OF PREDOMINANCE THESE TWO TONGUES MUST INEVITABLY COME INTO KEEN CONFLICT
6294-85684-0026 THEY WILL PERHAPS FIGHT THEIR BATTLE FOR THE LINGUISTIC CONQUEST OF EUROPE AND PERHAPS OF THE WORLD IN A GREAT URBAN REGION THAT WILL ARISE ABOUT THE RHINE POLITICALLY THIS REGION LIES NOW IN SIX INDEPENDENT STATES
6294-85684-0027 BUT ECONOMICALLY IT MUST BECOME ONE IN THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS IT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE THE GREATEST URBAN REGION IN ALL THE WORLD EXCEPT THAT WHICH WILL ARISE IN THE EASTERN STATES OF NORTH AMERICA AND THAT WHICH MAY ARISE SOMEWHERE ABOUT HANKOW
6294-85684-0028 IT WILL STRETCH FROM LILLE TO KIEL IT WILL DRIVE EXTENSIONS ALONG THE RHINE VALLEY INTO SWITZERLAND AND FLING AN ARM ALONG THE MOLDAU TO PRAGUE IT WILL BE THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITAL OF THE OLD WORLD
6294-85684-0029 IT WILL STRETCH A SPIDER'S WEB OF RAILWAYS AND GREAT ROADS OF THE NEW SORT OVER THE WHOLE CONTINENT EVEN WHEN THE COAL FIELD INDUSTRIES OF THE PLAIN GIVE PLACE TO THE INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION OF MOUNTAIN BORN ELECTRICITY
6294-85684-0030 THIS GREAT CITY REGION WILL REMAIN I BELIEVE IN ITS PRESENT POSITION AT THE SEAPORT END OF THE GREAT PLAIN OF THE OLD WORLD CONSIDERATIONS OF TRANSIT WILL KEEP IT WHERE IT HAS GROWN AND ELECTRICITY WILL BE BROUGHT TO IT IN MIGHTY CABLES FROM THE TORRENTS OF THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN MOUNTAIN MASS
6294-85684-0031 ITS WESTWARD PORT MAY BE BORDEAUX OR MILFORD HAVEN OR EVEN SOME PORT IN THE SOUTH WEST OF IRELAND UNLESS WHICH IS VERY UNLIKELY THE VELOCITY OF SECURE SEA TRAVEL CAN BE INCREASED BEYOND THAT OF LAND LOCOMOTION
6294-85684-0032 I DO NOT SEE HOW THIS GREAT REGION IS TO UNIFY ITSELF WITHOUT SOME LINGUISTIC COMPROMISE THE GERMANIZATION OF THE FRENCH SPEAKING PEOPLES BY FORCE IS TOO RIDICULOUS A SUGGESTION TO ENTERTAIN ALMOST INEVITABLY WITH TRAVEL
6294-85684-0033 WITH TRANSPORT COMMUNICATIONS WITH EVERY CONDITION OF HUMAN CONVENIENCE INSISTING UPON IT FORMALLY OR INFORMALLY A BI LINGUAL COMPROMISE WILL COME INTO OPERATION AND TO MY MIND AT LEAST THE CHANCES SEEM EVEN THAT FRENCH WILL EMERGE ON THE UPPER HAND UNLESS
6294-85684-0034 INDEED THAT GREAT RENASCENCE OF THE ENGLISH SPEAKING PEOPLES SHOULD AFTER ALL SO OVERWHELMINGLY OCCUR AS TO FORCE THIS EUROPEAN CITY TO BE TRI LINGUAL AND PREPARE THE WAY BY WHICH THE WHOLE WORLD MAY AT LAST SPEAK TOGETHER IN ONE TONGUE
6294-85684-0035 THESE ARE THE AGGREGATING TONGUES I DO NOT THINK THAT ANY OTHER TONGUES THAN THESE ARE QUITE LIKELY TO HOLD THEIR OWN IN THE COMING TIME ITALIAN MAY FLOURISH IN THE CITY OF THE PO VALLEY BUT ONLY WITH FRENCH BESIDE IT
6294-85684-0036 THEY ARE I BELIEVE ALREADY JUDGED BY A D TWO THOUSAND ALL THESE LANGUAGES WILL BE TENDING MORE AND MORE TO BE THE SECOND TONGUES OF BI LINGUAL COMMUNITIES WITH FRENCH OR ENGLISH OR LESS PROBABLY GERMAN WINNING THE UPPER HAND
6294-85684-0037 BUT WHEN ONE TURNS TO CHINA THERE ARE THE STRANGEST POSSIBILITIES
6294-85684-0038 IT IS IN EASTERN ASIA ALONE THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE ANY POSSIBILITY OF A SYNTHESIS SUFFICIENTLY GREAT TO MAINTAIN ITSELF ARISING OUTSIDE OF AND INDEPENDENTLY OF THE INTERLOCKED SYSTEM OF MECHANICALLY SUSTAINED SOCIETIES THAT IS DEVELOPING OUT OF MEDIAEVAL CHRISTENDOM
6294-85684-0039 THROUGHOUT EASTERN ASIA THERE IS STILL NO DOUBT A VAST WILDERNESS OF LANGUAGES BUT OVER THEM ALL RIDES THE CHINESE WRITING AND VERY STRONG
6294-85684-0040 STRONG ENOUGH TO BE VERY GRAVELY CONSIDERED IS THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT WRITING TAKING UP AN ORTHODOX ASSOCIATION OF SOUNDS AND BECOMING A WORLD SPEECH THE JAPANESE WRITTEN LANGUAGE THE LANGUAGE OF JAPANESE LITERATURE
6294-85684-0041 TENDS TO ASSIMILATE ITSELF TO CHINESE AND FRESH CHINESE WORDS AND EXPRESSIONS ARE CONTINUALLY TAKING ROOT IN JAPAN
6294-85684-0042 THE JAPANESE ARE A PEOPLE QUITE ABNORMAL AND INCALCULABLE WITH A TOUCH OF ROMANCE A CONCEPTION OF HONOUR A QUALITY OF IMAGINATION AND A CLEARNESS OF INTELLIGENCE THAT RENDERS POSSIBLE FOR THEM THINGS INCONCEIVABLE OF ANY OTHER EXISTING NATION
6294-85684-0043 I MAY BE THE SLAVE OF PERSPECTIVE EFFECTS BUT WHEN I TURN MY MIND FROM THE PETTIFOGGING MUDDLE OF THE ENGLISH HOUSE OF COMMONS FOR EXAMPLE THAT MAGNIFIED VESTRY THAT IS SO PROUD OF ITSELF AS A CLUB WHEN I TURN FROM THAT TO THIS RACE OF BRAVE AND SMILING PEOPLE
6294-85684-0044 ABRUPTLY DESTINY BEGINS DRAWING WITH A BOLDER HAND SUPPOSE THE JAPANESE WERE TO MAKE UP THEIR MINDS TO ACCELERATE WHATEVER PROCESS OF SYNTHESIS WERE POSSIBLE IN CHINA
