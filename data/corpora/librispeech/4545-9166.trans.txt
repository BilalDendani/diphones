4545-9166-0000 CHRISTIANITY MISUNDERSTOOD BY BELIEVERS MEANING OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE UNDERSTOOD BY A MINORITY HAS BECOME COMPLETELY INCOMPREHENSIBLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF MEN REASON OF THIS
4545-9166-0001 ITS ESSENCE AND DIFFERENCE FROM HEATHEN RELIGIONS CHRISTIANITY NOT FULLY COMPREHENDED AT THE BEGINNING
4545-9166-0002 SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THIS AROSE THE CLAIM TO POSSESSION OF THE AUTHENTIC MEANING OF THE DOCTRINE BASED ON THE MIRACULOUS NATURE OF ITS TRANSMISSION ASSEMBLY OF DISCIPLES AS DESCRIBED IN THE ACTS
4545-9166-0003 TO THE SOLE POSSESSION OF THE TRUE MEANING OF CHRIST'S TEACHING SUPPORTED BY MIRACULOUS EVIDENCE HAS LED BY LOGICAL DEVELOPMENT TO THE CREEDS OF THE CHURCHES A CHURCH COULD NOT BE FOUNDED BY CHRIST DEFINITIONS OF A CHURCH ACCORDING TO THE CATECHISMS
4545-9166-0004 THE CHURCHES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SEVERAL IN NUMBER AND HOSTILE TO ONE ANOTHER WHAT IS HERESY THE WORK OF G ARNOLD ON HERESIES
4545-9166-0005 THE SAME THING IS DONE BY THE OTHER CHURCHES ALL THE EXTERNAL CONDITIONS OF MODERN LIFE ARE SUCH AS TO DESTROY THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH AND THEREFORE THE CHURCHES USE EVERY EFFORT TO SUPPORT THEIR DOCTRINES
4545-9166-0006 THUS THE INFORMATION I RECEIVED AFTER MY BOOK CAME OUT WENT TO SHOW THAT THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE IN ITS DIRECT AND SIMPLE SENSE WAS UNDERSTOOD AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN UNDERSTOOD BY A MINORITY OF MEN WHILE THE CRITICS ECCLESIASTICAL AND FREETHINKING ALIKE DENIED
4545-9166-0007 THE POSSIBILITY OF TAKING CHRIST'S TEACHING IN ITS DIRECT SENSE ALL THIS CONVINCED ME THAT WHILE ON ONE HAND THE TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF THIS DOCTRINE HAD NEVER BEEN LOST TO A MINORITY BUT HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED MORE AND MORE CLEARLY
4545-9166-0008 ON THE OTHER HAND THE MEANING OF IT HAD BEEN MORE AND MORE OBSCURED FOR THE MAJORITY SO THAT AT LAST SUCH A DEPTH OF OBSCURITY HAS BEEN REACHED THAT MEN DO NOT TAKE IN THEIR DIRECT SENSE EVEN THE SIMPLEST PRECEPTS EXPRESSED IN THE SIMPLEST WORDS
4545-9166-0009 IN THE GOSPEL CHRIST'S TEACHING IS NOT GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD IN ITS TRUE SIMPLE AND DIRECT SENSE EVEN IN THESE DAYS WHEN THE LIGHT OF THE GOSPEL HAS PENETRATED EVEN TO THE DARKEST RECESSES OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS
4545-9166-0010 WHEN IN THE WORDS OF CHRIST THAT WHICH WAS SPOKEN IN THE EAR IS PROCLAIMED FROM THE HOUSETOPS AND WHEN THE GOSPEL IS INFLUENCING EVERY SIDE OF HUMAN LIFE DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CIVIC
4545-9166-0011 THIS LACK OF TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF CHRIST'S WORDS AT SUCH A TIME WOULD BE INEXPLICABLE IF THERE WERE NOT CAUSES TO ACCOUNT FOR IT ONE OF THESE CAUSES
4545-9166-0012 IS THAT THE FALSE INTERPRETATION AND CONSEQUENT MISAPPREHENSION OF THE GOSPEL IS AN ERROR OF SUCH LONG STANDING EVEN THE STRONGEST CURRENT OF WATER CANNOT ADD A DROP TO A CUP WHICH IS ALREADY FULL
4545-9166-0013 IF HE HAS NOT FORMED ANY IDEA OF THEM ALREADY BUT THE SIMPLEST THING CANNOT BE MADE CLEAR TO THE MOST INTELLIGENT MAN IF HE IS FIRMLY PERSUADED THAT HE KNOWS ALREADY WITHOUT A SHADOW OF DOUBT WHAT IS LAID BEFORE HIM
4545-9166-0014 THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE IS PRESENTED TO THE MEN OF OUR WORLD TO DAY AS A DOCTRINE WHICH EVERYONE HAS KNOWN SO LONG AND ACCEPTED SO UNHESITATINGLY
4545-9166-0015 THAT IT CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN IT IS UNDERSTOOD NOW CHRISTIANITY IS UNDERSTOOD NOW BY ALL WHO PROFESS THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AS A SUPERNATURAL MIRACULOUS REVELATION OF EVERYTHING WHICH IS REPEATED IN THE CREED
4545-9166-0016 BY UNBELIEVERS IT IS REGARDED AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF MAN'S CRAVING FOR A BELIEF IN THE SUPERNATURAL WHICH MANKIND HAS NOW OUTGROWN AS AN HISTORICAL PHENOMENON WHICH HAS RECEIVED FULL EXPRESSION IN CATHOLICISM GREEK ORTHODOXY AND PROTESTANTISM
4545-9166-0017 AND HAS NO LONGER ANY LIVING SIGNIFICANCE FOR US THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE GOSPEL IS HIDDEN FROM BELIEVERS BY THE CHURCH FROM UNBELIEVERS BY SCIENCE
4545-9166-0018 WAS IN BOTH FORM AND CONTENT ABSOLUTELY NEW TO THE JEWISH WORLD IN WHICH IT ORIGINATED AND STILL MORE TO THE ROMAN WORLD IN WHICH IT WAS PREACHED AND DIFFUSED
4545-9166-0019 LAW WAS LAID UPON LAW AND IN THE MIDST OF THE ROMAN LEGAL SYSTEM WORKED OUT TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF PERFECTION A NEW DOCTRINE APPEARED WHICH DENIED NOT ONLY EVERY DEITY AND ALL FEAR AND WORSHIP OF THEM
4545-9166-0020 BUT EVEN ALL HUMAN INSTITUTIONS AND ALL NECESSITY FOR THEM IN PLACE OF ALL THE RULES OF THE OLD RELIGIONS THIS DOCTRINE SETS UP ONLY A TYPE OF INWARD PERFECTION TRUTH AND LOVE IN THE PERSON OF CHRIST AND
4545-9166-0021 AS A RESULT OF THIS INWARD PERFECTION BEING ATTAINED BY MEN ALSO THE OUTWARD PERFECTION FORETOLD BY THE PROPHETS THE KINGDOM OF GOD WHEN ALL MEN WILL CEASE TO LEARN TO MAKE WAR WHEN ALL SHALL BE TAUGHT OF GOD AND UNITED IN LOVE AND THE LION WILL LIE DOWN WITH THE LAMB
4545-9166-0022 IF ANY MAN WILL DO HIS WILL HE SHALL KNOW OF THE DOCTRINE WHETHER IT BE OF GOD
4545-9166-0023 BUT YE SEEK TO KILL ME A MAN THAT HATH TOLD YOU THE TRUTH YE SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE GOD IS A SPIRIT AND THEY THAT WORSHIP HIM MUST WORSHIP HIM IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH KEEP MY SAYINGS
4545-9166-0024 AND YE SHALL KNOW OF MY SAYINGS WHETHER THEY BE TRUE NO PROOFS OF THIS DOCTRINE WERE OFFERED EXCEPT ITS TRUTH THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE DOCTRINE WITH THE TRUTH THE WHOLE TEACHING CONSISTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF TRUTH AND FOLLOWING IT
4545-9166-0025 IN A GREATER AND GREATER ATTAINMENT OF TRUTH AND A CLOSER AND CLOSER FOLLOWING OF IT IN THE ACTS OF LIFE THERE ARE NO ACTS IN THIS DOCTRINE WHICH COULD JUSTIFY A MAN AND MAKE HIM SAVED THERE IS ONLY THE IMAGE OF TRUTH TO GUIDE HIM FOR INWARD PERFECTION IN THE PERSON OF CHRIST
4545-9166-0026 AND FOR OUTWARD PERFECTION IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD THE FULFILLMENT OF THIS TEACHING CONSISTS ONLY IN WALKING IN THE CHOSEN WAY IN GETTING NEARER TO INWARD PERFECTION IN THE IMITATION OF CHRIST
4545-9166-0027 THE GREATER OR LESS BLESSEDNESS OF A MAN
4545-9166-0028 BUT ON THE GREATER OR LESS SWIFTNESS WITH WHICH HE IS PURSUING IT
4545-9166-0029 THAT WAS A SINNER OF THE ROBBER ON THE CROSS IS A GREATER STATE OF BLESSEDNESS ACCORDING TO THIS DOCTRINE THAN THE STATIONARY RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE PHARISEE
4545-9166-0030 BE YE PERFECT EVEN AS YOUR FATHER IN HEAVEN IS PERFECT SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN AND ITS RIGHTEOUSNESS
4545-9166-0031 THE FULFILLMENT OF THIS PRECEPT IS ONLY TO BE FOUND IN UNINTERRUPTED PROGRESS TOWARD THE ATTAINMENT OF EVER HIGHER TRUTH TOWARD ESTABLISHING MORE AND MORE FIRMLY AN EVER GREATER LOVE WITHIN ONESELF AND ESTABLISHING MORE AND MORE WIDELY
4545-9166-0032 THE KINGDOM OF GOD OUTSIDE ONESELF IT IS OBVIOUS THAT APPEARING AS IT DID IN THE MIDST OF THE JEWISH AND HEATHEN WORLD SUCH TEACHING COULD NOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE MAJORITY OF MEN
4545-9166-0033 IT IS OBVIOUS TOO THAT EVEN FOR THOSE BY WHOM IT WAS ACCEPTED
4545-9166-0034 THAT IT COULD NOT BE COMPREHENSIBLE IN ITS FULL SIGNIFICANCE IT HAS BEEN ONLY BY A SUCCESSION OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS ERRORS PARTIAL EXPLANATIONS AND THE CORRECTIONS AND ADDITIONS OF GENERATIONS
4545-9166-0035 THAT THE MEANING OF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE HAS GROWN CONTINUALLY MORE AND MORE CLEAR TO MEN THE CHRISTIAN VIEW OF LIFE HAS EXERTED AN INFLUENCE ON THE JEWISH AND HEATHEN AND THE HEATHEN AND JEWISH VIEW OF LIFE HAS TOO EXERTED AN INFLUENCE ON THE CHRISTIAN
4545-9166-0036 AND CHRISTIANITY AS THE LIVING FORCE HAS GAINED MORE AND MORE UPON THE EXTINCT JUDAISM AND HEATHENISM AND HAS GROWN CONTINUALLY CLEARER AND CLEARER AS IT FREED ITSELF FROM THE ADMIXTURE OF FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD OVERLAID IT
4545-9166-0037 MEN WENT FURTHER AND FURTHER IN THE ATTAINMENT OF THE MEANING OF CHRISTIANITY AND REALIZED IT MORE AND MORE IN LIFE THE LONGER MANKIND LIVED THE CLEARER AND CLEARER BECAME THE MEANING OF CHRISTIANITY
4545-9166-0038 AS MUST ALWAYS BE THE CASE WITH EVERY THEORY OF LIFE SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS CORRECTED THE ERRORS OF THEIR PREDECESSORS AND GREW EVER NEARER AND NEARER TO A COMPREHENSION OF THE TRUE MEANING IT WAS THUS FROM THE VERY EARLIEST TIMES OF CHRISTIANITY
4545-9166-0039 AND SO TOO FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES OF CHRISTIANITY THERE WERE MEN WHO BEGAN TO ASSERT ON THEIR OWN AUTHORITY THAT THE MEANING THEY ATTRIBUTE TO THE DOCTRINE IS THE ONLY TRUE ONE
4545-9166-0040 THIS WAS THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE AT FIRST OF THE MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE DOCTRINE AND AFTERWARD OF THE COMPLETE DISTORTION OF IT IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT CHRIST'S TEACHING
4545-9166-0041 WAS TRANSMITTED TO MEN NOT LIKE EVERY OTHER TRUTH BUT IN A SPECIAL MIRACULOUS WAY
4545-9166-0042 BUT BY THE MIRACULOUS MANNER OF ITS TRANSMISSION WHICH WAS ADVANCED AS AN IRREFUTABLE PROOF OF THE TRUTH OF THE INTERPRETATION PUT ON IT THIS HYPOTHESIS ORIGINATED FROM MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE TEACHING AND ITS RESULT
4545-9166-0043 WAS TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND IT RIGHTLY AND THIS HAPPENED FIRST IN THE EARLIEST TIMES WHEN THE DOCTRINE WAS STILL NOT SO FULLY UNDERSTOOD AND OFTEN INTERPRETED WRONGLY AS WE SEE BY THE GOSPELS AND THE ACTS THE LESS THE DOCTRINE WAS UNDERSTOOD
4545-9166-0044 DID NOT NEED TO BE PROVED BY MIRACLES AND NEEDED NO EXERCISE OF FAITH BECAUSE THIS PROPOSITION IS IN ITSELF CONVINCING AND IN HARMONY WITH MAN'S MIND AND NATURE BUT THE PROPOSITION THAT CHRIST WAS GOD HAD TO BE PROVED BY MIRACLES COMPLETELY BEYOND OUR COMPREHENSION
4545-9166-0045 THE MORE THE UNDERSTANDING OF CHRIST'S TEACHING WAS OBSCURED
4545-9166-0046 THE MORE THE DOCTRINE WAS STRAINED FROM ITS MEANING AND THE MORE OBSCURE IT BECAME
4545-9166-0047 AND THE LESS COMPREHENSIBLE THE DOCTRINE BECAME ONE CAN SEE BY THE GOSPELS THE ACTS AND THE EPISTLES HOW FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES THE NON COMPREHENSION OF THE DOCTRINE CALLED FORTH THE NEED FOR PROOFS THROUGH THE MIRACULOUS AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE
4545-9166-0048 THE FIRST EXAMPLE IN THE BOOK OF ACTS IS THE ASSEMBLY WHICH GATHERED TOGETHER IN JERUSALEM TO DECIDE THE QUESTION WHICH HAD ARISEN WHETHER TO BAPTIZE OR NOT THE UNCIRCUMCISED AND THOSE WHO HAD EATEN OF FOOD SACRIFICED TO IDOLS
4545-9166-0049 WHO REJECTED ALL OUTWARD OBSERVANCES ABLUTIONS PURIFICATIONS FASTS AND SABBATHS IT WAS PLAINLY SAID
4545-9166-0050 AND THEREFORE THE QUESTION OF BAPTIZING THE UNCIRCUMCISED COULD ONLY HAVE ARISEN AMONG MEN WHO THOUGH THEY LOVED THEIR MASTER AND DIMLY FELT THE GRANDEUR OF HIS TEACHING STILL DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TEACHING ITSELF VERY CLEARLY AND THIS WAS THE FACT
4545-9166-0051 TO GIVE EXTERNAL CONFIRMATION TO CERTAIN ASSERTIONS AND WHICH HAS BEEN PRODUCTIVE OF SO MUCH EVIL THAT IS IT WAS ASSERTED THAT THE CORRECTNESS OF WHAT THEY HAD DECIDED WAS GUARANTEED BY THE MIRACULOUS PARTICIPATION OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT IS OF GOD IN THEIR DECISION
4545-9166-0052 BUT THE ASSERTION THAT THE HOLY GHOST THAT IS GOD SPOKE THROUGH THE APOSTLES IN ITS TURN WANTED PROOF AND THUS IT WAS NECESSARY TO CONFIRM THIS THAT THE HOLY GHOST SHOULD DESCEND AT PENTECOST IN TONGUES OF FIRE UPON THOSE WHO MADE THIS ASSERTION
4545-9166-0053 IN THE ACCOUNT OF IT THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY GHOST PRECEDES THE ASSEMBLY BUT THE BOOK OF ACTS WAS WRITTEN MUCH LATER THAN BOTH EVENTS BUT THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY GHOST TOO HAD TO BE PROVED FOR THOSE WHO HAD NOT SEEN THE TONGUES OF FIRE
4545-9166-0054 AND SO AROSE THE NECESSITY FOR STILL MORE MIRACLES AND CHANGES RAISINGS OF THE DEAD TO LIFE AND STRIKINGS OF THE LIVING DEAD AND ALL THOSE MARVELS WHICH HAVE BEEN A STUMBLING BLOCK TO MEN OF WHICH THE ACTS IS FULL AND WHICH FAR
4545-9166-0055 IT BECAME THUS IT WAS FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES AND SO IT WENT ON CONSTANTLY INCREASING TILL IT REACHED IN OUR DAY THE LOGICAL CLIMAX OF THE DOGMAS OF TRANSUBSTANTIATION AND THE INFALLIBILITY OF THE POPE OR OF THE BISHOPS OR OF SCRIPTURE
4545-9166-0056 AND OF REQUIRING A BLIND FAITH RENDERED INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND UTTERLY MEANINGLESS NOT IN GOD BUT IN CHRIST NOT IN A DOCTRINE BUT IN A PERSON AS IN CATHOLICISM OR IN PERSONS AS IN GREEK ORTHODOXY OR IN A BOOK AS IN PROTESTANTISM
4545-9166-0057 THE MORE WIDELY CHRISTIANITY WAS DIFFUSED AND THE GREATER THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE UNPREPARED FOR IT WHO WERE BROUGHT UNDER ITS SWAY THE LESS IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THE MORE ABSOLUTELY WAS ITS INFALLIBILITY INSISTED ON
4545-9166-0058 TO A RESUME SUPPORTED BY THE TEMPORAL AUTHORITY OF THE DISPUTES THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE COUNCIL TO A CREED WHICH RECKONED OFF I BELIEVE IN SO AND SO AND SO AND SO AND SO AND SO TO THE END TO ONE HOLY APOSTOLIC CHURCH
4545-9166-0059 GOD COULD NOT LEAVE MEN TO INTERPRET HIS TEACHING AT RANDOM THEREFORE HE FOUNDED THE CHURCH ALL THOSE STATEMENTS ARE SO UTTERLY UNTRUE AND UNFOUNDED THAT ONE IS ASHAMED TO REFUTE THEM NOWHERE NOR IN
4545-9166-0060 ANYTHING EXCEPT IN THE ASSERTION OF THE CHURCH CAN WE FIND THAT GOD OR CHRIST FOUNDED ANYTHING LIKE WHAT CHURCHMEN UNDERSTAND BY THE CHURCH IN THE GOSPELS THERE IS A WARNING AGAINST THE CHURCH AS IT IS AN EXTERNAL AUTHORITY
4545-9166-0061 CHRIST'S FOLLOWERS SHOULD CALL NO MAN MASTER BUT NOWHERE IS ANYTHING SAID OF THE FOUNDATION OF WHAT CHURCHMEN CALL THE CHURCH
4545-9166-0062 THE OTHER TIME IN CONNECTION WITH THE OBSCURE UTTERANCE ABOUT A STONE PETER AND THE GATES OF HELL FROM THESE TWO PASSAGES IN WHICH THE WORD CHURCH IS USED IN THE SIGNIFICATION MERELY OF AN ASSEMBLY HAS BEEN DEDUCED ALL THAT WE NOW UNDERSTAND
4545-9166-0063 BY THE CHURCH BUT CHRIST COULD NOT HAVE FOUNDED THE CHURCH THAT IS WHAT WE NOW UNDERSTAND BY THAT WORD FOR NOTHING LIKE THE IDEA OF THE CHURCH AS WE KNOW IT NOW WITH ITS SACRAMENTS MIRACLES AND ABOVE ALL ITS CLAIM TO INFALLIBILITY
4545-9166-0064 IS TO BE FOUND EITHER IN CHRIST'S WORDS OR IN THE IDEAS OF THE MEN OF THAT TIME
4545-9166-0065 BESIDES IF CHRIST HAD REALLY FOUNDED SUCH AN INSTITUTION AS THE CHURCH FOR THE FOUNDATION OF ALL HIS TEACHING AND THE WHOLE FAITH HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE DESCRIBED THIS INSTITUTION CLEARLY AND DEFINITELY AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE ONLY TRUE CHURCH BESIDES TALES OF MIRACLES WHICH
4545-9166-0066 SOME TOKENS SO UNMISTAKABLE THAT NO DOUBT OF ITS GENUINENESS COULD EVER HAVE ARISEN BUT NOTHING OF THE SORT WAS DONE BY HIM AND THERE HAVE BEEN AND STILL ARE DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS EACH CALLING ITSELF THE TRUE CHURCH
4545-9166-0067 THE CATHOLIC CATECHISM SAYS L'EGLISE
4545-9166-0068 ET SOUMISE A L'AUTHORITE DES
4545-9166-0069 SEE FOOTNOTE UNDERSTANDING BY THE WORDS PASTEURS
4545-9166-0070 AN ASSOCIATION OF MEN HAVING THE POPE AT ITS HEAD AND CONSISTING OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS BOUND TOGETHER BY A CERTAIN ORGANIZATION FOOTNOTE THE CHURCH IS THE SOCIETY OF THE FAITHFUL
4545-9166-0071 ESTABLISHED BY OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST SPREAD OVER THE WHOLE EARTH AND SUBJECT TO THE AUTHORITY OF ITS LAWFUL PASTORS AND CHIEF OF THEM OUR HOLY FATHER THE POPE
4545-9166-0072 THE GREEK ORTHODOX CATECHISM SAYS THE CHURCH IS A SOCIETY FOUNDED UPON EARTH BY JESUS CHRIST WHICH IS UNITED INTO ONE WHOLE BY ONE DIVINE DOCTRINE AND BY SACRAMENTS UNDER THE RULE AND GUIDANCE OF A PRIESTHOOD APPOINTED BY GOD
4545-9166-0073 THE GREEK ORTHODOX PRIESTHOOD CONSISTING OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO HAPPEN TO BE IN SUCH OR SUCH POSITIONS THE LUTHERAN CATECHISM SAYS THE CHURCH IS HOLY CHRISTIANITY OR THE COLLECTION OF ALL BELIEVERS UNDER CHRIST THEIR HEAD
4545-9166-0074 TO WHOM THE HOLY GHOST THROUGH THE GOSPELS AND SACRAMENTS PROMISES COMMUNICATES AND ADMINISTERS HEAVENLY SALVATION MEANING THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS LOST IN ERROR AND THAT THE TRUE MEANS OF SALVATION IS IN LUTHERANISM
4545-9166-0075 FOR CATHOLICS THE CHURCH OF GOD COINCIDES WITH THE ROMAN PRIESTHOOD AND THE POPE FOR THE GREEK ORTHODOX BELIEVER THE CHURCH OF GOD COINCIDES WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT AND PRIESTHOOD OF RUSSIA SEE FOOTNOTE FOOTNOTE
4545-9166-0076 HOMYAKOV'S DEFINITION OF THE CHURCH WHICH WAS RECEIVED WITH SOME FAVOR AMONG RUSSIANS DOES NOT IMPROVE MATTERS IF WE ARE TO AGREE WITH HOMYAKOV IN CONSIDERING THE GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH AS THE ONE TRUE CHURCH
4545-9166-0077 HOMYAKOV ASSERTS THAT A CHURCH IS A COLLECTION OF MEN ALL WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF CLERGY AND LAYMEN UNITED TOGETHER BY LOVE AND THAT ONLY TO MEN UNITED BY LOVE IS THE TRUTH REVEALED LET US LOVE EACH OTHER THAT
4545-9166-0078 RECOGNIZE THE POPES AND NEW DOGMAS BUT WITH SUCH A DEFINITION OF THE CHURCH THERE IS STILL MORE DIFFICULTY IN RECONCILING AS HOMYAKOV TRIES TO DO THE CHURCH UNITED BY LOVE WITH THE CHURCH THAT RECOGNIZES THE NICENE CREED AND THE DOCTRINE OF PHOTIUS
4545-9166-0079 SO THAT HOMYAKOV'S ASSERTION THAT THIS CHURCH UNITED BY LOVE AND CONSEQUENTLY HOLY IS THE SAME CHURCH AS THE GREEK ORTHODOX PRIESTHOOD PROFESS FAITH IN
4545-9166-0080 IF WE ADMIT THE IDEA OF A CHURCH IN THE SENSE HOMYAKOV GIVES TO IT THAT IS A BODY OF MEN BOUND TOGETHER BY LOVE AND TRUTH THEN ALL THAT ANY MAN CAN PREDICATE IN REGARD TO THIS BODY IF SUCH AN ONE EXISTS IS ITS LOVE AND TRUTH
4545-9166-0081 BUT THERE CAN BE NO OUTER SIGNS BY WHICH ONE COULD RECKON ONESELF OR ANOTHER AS A MEMBER OF THIS HOLY BODY NOR BY WHICH ONE COULD PUT ANYONE OUTSIDE IT SO THAT NO INSTITUTION HAVING AN EXTERNAL EXISTENCE CAN CORRESPOND TO THIS IDEA
4545-9166-0082 FOR LUTHERANS THE CHURCH OF GOD COINCIDES WITH A BODY OF MEN WHO RECOGNIZE THE AUTHORITY OF THE BIBLE AND LUTHER'S CATECHISM
4545-9166-0083 WHILE BELIEVERS WERE AGREED AMONG THEMSELVES AND THE BODY WAS ONE IT HAD NO NEED TO DECLARE ITSELF AS A CHURCH IT WAS ONLY WHEN BELIEVERS WERE SPLIT UP INTO OPPOSING PARTIES RENOUNCING ONE ANOTHER THAT IT SEEMED NECESSARY TO EACH PARTY TO CONFIRM THEIR OWN TRUTH
4545-9166-0084 BY ASCRIBING TO THEMSELVES INFALLIBILITY THE CONCEPTION OF ONE CHURCH ONLY AROSE WHEN THERE WERE TWO SIDES DIVIDED AND DISPUTING WHO EACH CALLED THE OTHER SIDE HERESY AND RECOGNIZED THEIR OWN SIDE ONLY AS THE INFALLIBLE CHURCH
4545-9166-0085 IF WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS A CHURCH WHICH DECIDED IN THE YEAR FIFTY ONE TO RECEIVE THE UNCIRCUMCISED IT IS ONLY SO BECAUSE THERE WAS ANOTHER CHURCH OF THE JUDAISTS WHO DECIDED TO KEEP THE UNCIRCUMCISED OUT
4545-9166-0086 IF THERE IS A CATHOLIC CHURCH NOW WHICH ASSERTS ITS OWN INFALLIBILITY THAT IS ONLY BECAUSE THERE ARE CHURCHES
4545-9166-0087 EACH ASSERTING ITS OWN INFALLIBILITY AND DENYING THAT OF ALL OTHER CHURCHES SO THAT THE ONE CHURCH IS ONLY A FANTASTIC IMAGINATION WHICH HAS NOT THE LEAST TRACE OF REALITY ABOUT IT AS A REAL HISTORICAL FACT
4545-9166-0088 OPENLY ASSERT THIS IN THE CATHOLIC CATECHISM IT IS SAID
4545-9166-0089 FOOTNOTE WHO ARE THOSE WHO ARE OUTSIDE THE CHURCH INFIDELS HERETICS AND SCHISMATICS THE SO CALLED GREEK ORTHODOX ARE REGARDED AS SCHISMATICS THE LUTHERANS AS HERETICS
4545-9166-0090 SO THAT ACCORDING TO THE CATHOLIC CATECHISM THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH ARE CATHOLICS IN THE SO CALLED ORTHODOX CATECHISM IT IS SAID BY THE ONE CHRISTIAN CHURCH IS UNDERSTOOD THE ORTHODOX WHICH REMAINS FULLY IN ACCORD WITH THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH
4545-9166-0091 WILL BE KNOWN BY THE WORD OF GOD BEING STUDIED CLEAR AND UNMIXED WITH MAN'S ADDITIONS AND THE SACRAMENTS BEING MAINTAINED FAITHFUL TO CHRIST'S TEACHING ACCORDING TO THIS DEFINITION
4545-9166-0092 THE PROTESTANTS OF EVERY KIND LUTHERANS REFORMED CHURCH PRESBYTERIANS METHODISTS SWEDENBORGIANS MORMONS ASSERT THAT THE HOLY GHOST IS ONLY PRESENT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES
4545-9166-0093 IF THE CATHOLICS ASSERT THAT THE HOLY GHOST AT THE TIME OF THE DIVISION OF THE CHURCH INTO ARIAN AND GREEK LEFT THE CHURCH THAT FELL AWAY
4545-9166-0094 THE HOLY GHOST LEFT THE CATHOLIC AND PASSED INTO THE CHURCH THEY PROFESSED AND THIS IS JUST WHAT THEY DO EVERY CHURCH TRACES ITS CREED THROUGH AN UNINTERRUPTED TRANSMISSION FROM CHRIST AND THE APOSTLES AND TRULY EVERY CHRISTIAN CREED
4545-9166-0095 EVERY BRANCH IN A TREE COMES FROM THE ROOT IN UNBROKEN CONNECTION
4545-9166-0096 AS EVERY OTHER SO THAT THERE IS BUT ONE STRICT AND EXACT DEFINITION OF WHAT IS A CHURCH
4545-9166-0097 BUT OF WHAT IT IS AND HAS BEEN IN REALITY A CHURCH IS A BODY OF MEN WHO CLAIM FOR THEMSELVES THAT THEY ARE IN COMPLETE AND SOLE POSSESSION OF THE TRUTH AND THESE BODIES HAVING IN COURSE OF TIME AIDED BY THE SUPPORT OF THE TEMPORAL AUTHORITIES
4545-9166-0098 DEVELOPED INTO POWERFUL INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN THE PRINCIPAL OBSTACLES TO THE DIFFUSION OF A TRUE COMPREHENSION OF THE TEACHING OF CHRIST IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE THE CHIEF PECULIARITY WHICH DISTINGUISHED CHRIST'S TEACHING
4545-9166-0099 STRANGE THOUGH IT MAY SEEM TO US WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THE ERRONEOUS VIEW OF THE CHURCH AS A CHRISTIAN INSTITUTION AND IN CONTEMPT FOR HERESY YET THE FACT IS THAT ONLY IN WHAT WAS CALLED HERESY WAS THERE ANY TRUE MOVEMENT
4545-9166-0100 THAT IS TRUE CHRISTIANITY AND THAT IT ONLY CEASED TO BE SO WHEN THOSE HERESIES STOPPED SHORT IN THEIR MOVEMENT
4545-9166-0101 SINCE EVERY THEOLOGICAL WORK DEALS WITH THE TRUE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST AS DISTINGUISHED
4545-9166-0102 YET YOU WILL NOT FIND ANYWHERE ANYTHING
4545-9166-0103 THERE IS MUCH TO BE GAINED BY SEPARATION FROM IT CONFLICT WITH ERROR HAS NO WEAPONS OTHER THAN THOUGHT AND FEELING ONE UNIFORM TYPE OF DOCTRINE HAS NOT YET BEEN ELABORATED
4545-9166-0104 DIVERGENCIES IN SECONDARY MATTERS ARISE FREELY IN EAST AND WEST THEOLOGY IS NOT WEDDED TO INVARIABLE FORMULAS IF IN THE MIDST OF THIS DIVERSITY A MASS OF BELIEFS COMMON TO ALL IS APPARENT
4545-9166-0105 IS ONE NOT JUSTIFIED IN SEEING IN IT NOT A FORMULATED SYSTEM FRAMED BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF PEDANTIC AUTHORITY BUT FAITH ITSELF IN ITS SUREST INSTINCT AND ITS MOST SPONTANEOUS MANIFESTATION
4545-9166-0106 IF THE SAME UNANIMITY WHICH IS REVEALED IN ESSENTIAL POINTS OF BELIEF IS FOUND ALSO IN REJECTING CERTAIN TENDENCIES ARE WE NOT JUSTIFIED IN CONCLUDING THAT THESE TENDENCIES WERE IN FLAGRANT OPPOSITION TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF CHRISTIANITY
4545-9166-0107 AND WILL NOT THIS PRESUMPTION BE TRANSFORMED INTO CERTAINTY IF WE RECOGNIZE IN THE DOCTRINE UNIVERSALLY REJECTED BY THE CHURCH THE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF ONE OF THE RELIGIONS OF THE PAST TO SAY THAT GNOSTICISM OR EBIONITISM
4545-9166-0108 ARE LEGITIMATE FORMS OF CHRISTIAN THOUGHT ONE MUST BOLDLY DENY THE EXISTENCE OF CHRISTIAN THOUGHT AT ALL OR ANY SPECIFIC CHARACTER BY WHICH IT COULD BE RECOGNIZED WHILE OSTENSIBLY WIDENING ITS REALM ONE UNDERMINES IT
4545-9166-0109 NO ONE IN THE TIME OF PLATO WOULD HAVE VENTURED TO GIVE HIS NAME TO A DOCTRINE IN WHICH THE THEORY OF IDEAS HAD NO PLACE AND ONE WOULD DESERVEDLY HAVE EXCITED THE RIDICULE OF GREECE BY TRYING TO PASS OFF EPICURUS OR ZENO AS A DISCIPLE OF THE ACADEMY
4545-9166-0110 THE AUTHOR'S WHOLE ARGUMENT AMOUNTS TO THIS THAT EVERY OPINION WHICH DIFFERS FROM THE CODE OF DOGMAS WE BELIEVE IN AT A GIVEN TIME IS HERESY
4545-9166-0111 EVERY SO CALLED HERESY REGARDING AS IT DOES ITS OWN CREED AS THE TRUTH CAN JUST AS EASILY FIND IN CHURCH HISTORY A SERIES OF ILLUSTRATIONS OF ITS OWN CREED CAN USE ALL PRESSENSE'S ARGUMENTS ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND CAN CALL ITS OWN CREED
4545-9166-0112 THE ONE TRULY CHRISTIAN CREED
4545-9166-0113 THE ONLY DEFINITION OF HERESY THE WORD
4545-9166-0114 KETZER HISTORIE SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE BY GOTTFRIED ARNOLD
4545-9166-0115 AND POINTS OUT ALL THE UNLAWFULNESS THE ARBITRARINESS THE SENSELESSNESS AND THE CRUELTY OF USING THE WORD HERETIC IN THE SENSE OF REPROBATE THIS BOOK IS AN ATTEMPT TO WRITE THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY IN THE FORM OF A HISTORY OF HERESY
4545-9166-0116 AS EXAMPLES OF THESE QUESTIONS IN WHICH THE ANSWERS ARE TO SOME EXTENT INCLUDED ALSO I WILL QUOTE THE FOLLOWING UNDER THE FOURTH HEAD OF THE MANNER IN WHICH HERETICS ARE MADE HE SAYS IN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE SEVENTH
4545-9166-0117 DOES NOT ALL HISTORY SHOW THAT THE GREATEST MAKERS OF HERETICS AND MASTERS OF THAT CRAFT WERE JUST THESE WISE MEN FROM WHOM THE FATHER HID HIS SECRETS THAT IS THE HYPOCRITES THE PHARISEES AND LAWYERS MEN UTTERLY GODLESS AND PERVERTED
4545-9166-0118 QUESTION TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND IN THE CORRUPT TIMES OF CHRISTIANITY WERE NOT THESE VERY MEN CAST OUT DENOUNCED BY THE HYPOCRITES AND ENVIOUS WHO WERE ENDOWED BY GOD WITH GREAT GIFTS AND WHO WOULD IN THE DAYS OF PURE CHRISTIANITY HAVE BEEN HELD IN HIGH HONOR
4545-9166-0119 AND ON THE OTHER HAND WOULD NOT THE MEN WHO IN THE DECLINE OF CHRISTIANITY RAISED THEMSELVES ABOVE ALL AND REGARDED THEMSELVES AS THE TEACHERS OF THE PUREST CHRISTIANITY WOULD NOT THESE VERY MEN IN THE TIMES OF THE APOSTLES AND DISCIPLES OF CHRIST HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS THE MOST SHAMELESS
4545-9166-0120 HERETICS AND ANTI CHRISTIANS HE EXPOUNDS AMONG OTHER THINGS IN THESE QUESTIONS THE THEORY THAT ANY VERBAL EXPRESSION OF FAITH SUCH AS WAS DEMANDED BY THE CHURCH AND THE DEPARTURE FROM WHICH WAS RECKONED AS HERESY
4545-9166-0121 COULD NEVER FULLY COVER THE EXACT RELIGIOUS IDEAS OF A BELIEVER AND THAT THEREFORE THE DEMAND FOR AN EXPRESSION OF FAITH IN CERTAIN WORDS WAS EVER PRODUCTIVE OF HERESY
4545-9166-0122 AND IF HEAVENLY THINGS AND THOUGHTS PRESENT THEMSELVES TO A MAN'S MIND AS SO GREAT AND SO PROFOUND THAT HE DOES NOT FIND CORRESPONDING WORDS TO EXPRESS THEM OUGHT ONE TO CALL HIM A HERETIC BECAUSE HE CANNOT EXPRESS HIS IDEA WITH PERFECT EXACTNESS
4545-9166-0123 WAS IT NOT THE EASIEST AND MOST ORDINARY ECCLESIASTICAL PROCEEDING IF THE CLERGY WANTED TO GET RID OF OR TO RUIN ANYONE FOR THEM TO CAST SUSPICION ON THE PERSON'S BELIEF AND TO THROW A CLOAK OF HERESY UPON HIM AND BY THIS MEANS
4545-9166-0124 TRUE THOUGH IT MAY BE THAT THERE WERE SINS AND ERRORS AMONG THE SO CALLED HERETICS IT IS NO LESS TRUE AND EVIDENT HE SAYS FARTHER ON FROM THE INNUMERABLE EXAMPLES QUOTED HERE
4545-9166-0125 THAT THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE SINCERE AND CONSCIENTIOUS MAN OF ANY IMPORTANCE WHOM THE CHURCHMEN WOULD NOT FROM ENVY OR OTHER CAUSES HAVE RUINED THUS ALMOST TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE REAL MEANING OF HERESY WAS UNDERSTOOD
4545-9166-0126 AND NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE SAME CONCEPTION OF IT HAS GONE ON EXISTING UP TO NOW AND IT CANNOT FAIL TO EXIST SO LONG AS THE CONCEPTION OF A CHURCH EXISTS HERESY IS THE OBVERSE SIDE OF THE CHURCH
4545-9166-0127 WHEREVER THERE IS A CHURCH THERE MUST BE THE CONCEPTION OF HERESY
4545-9166-0128 HERESY IS THE OPINION OF THE MEN WHO DO NOT ADMIT THE INFALLIBILITY OF THE CHURCH'S TRUTH HERESY MAKES ITS APPEARANCE IN THE CHURCH IT IS THE EFFORT TO BREAK THROUGH THE PETRIFIED AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH
4545-9166-0129 ALL EFFORT AFTER A LIVING COMPREHENSION OF THE DOCTRINE HAS BEEN MADE BY HERETICS
4545-9166-0130 LUTHER HUSS SAVONAROLA HELCHITSKY AND THE REST WERE HERETICS IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE THE FOLLOWER OF CHRIST WHOSE SERVICE MEANS AN EVER GROWING UNDERSTANDING OF HIS TEACHING AND AN EVER CLOSER FULFILLMENT OF IT
4545-9166-0131 TO ASSERT OF ONE'S SELF OR OF ANY BODY OF MEN THAT ONE IS OR THEY ARE IN POSSESSION OF PERFECT UNDERSTANDING AND FULFILLMENT OF CHRIST'S WORD IS TO RENOUNCE THE VERY SPIRIT OF CHRIST'S TEACHING STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THE CHURCHES AS
4545-9166-0132 INSTITUTIONS NOT ONLY ALIEN IN SPIRIT TO CHRIST'S TEACHING BUT EVEN DIRECTLY ANTAGONISTIC TO IT WITH GOOD REASON VOLTAIRE CALLS THE CHURCH L'INFAME WITH GOOD REASON HAVE ALL OR ALMOST ALL SO CALLED SECTS OF CHRISTIANS RECOGNIZED THE CHURCH
4545-9166-0133 AS THE SCARLET WOMAN FORETOLD IN THE APOCALYPSE WITH GOOD REASON IS THE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH THE HISTORY OF THE GREATEST CRUELTIES AND HORRORS THE CHURCHES AS CHURCHES ARE NOT AS MANY PEOPLE SUPPOSE INSTITUTIONS
4545-9166-0134 WHICH HAVE CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES FOR THEIR BASIS EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE STRAYED A LITTLE AWAY FROM THE STRAIGHT PATH THE CHURCHES AS CHURCHES AS BODIES WHICH ASSERT THEIR OWN INFALLIBILITY ARE INSTITUTIONS OPPOSED TO CHRISTIANITY
4545-9166-0135 THERE IS NOT ONLY NOTHING IN COMMON BETWEEN THE CHURCHES AS SUCH AND CHRISTIANITY EXCEPT THE NAME BUT THEY REPRESENT TWO PRINCIPLES FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED AND ANTAGONISTIC TO ONE ANOTHER
4545-9166-0136 ONE REPRESENTS PRIDE VIOLENCE SELF ASSERTION STAGNATION AND DEATH THE OTHER MEEKNESS PENITENCE HUMILITY PROGRESS AND LIFE WE CANNOT SERVE THESE TWO MASTERS WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM
4545-9166-0137 THE SERVANTS OF THE CHURCHES OF ALL DENOMINATIONS ESPECIALLY OF LATER TIMES TRY TO SHOW THEMSELVES CHAMPIONS OF PROGRESS IN CHRISTIANITY THEY MAKE CONCESSIONS
4545-9166-0138 AND MAINTAIN THAT ONE CANNOT ON ACCOUNT OF THESE ABUSES DENY THE PRINCIPLE ITSELF OF A CHRISTIAN CHURCH WHICH ALONE CAN BIND ALL MEN TOGETHER IN UNITY AND BE A MEDIATOR BETWEEN MEN AND GOD BUT THIS IS ALL A MISTAKE NOT ONLY HAVE CHURCHES NEVER BOUND MEN TOGETHER IN UNITY
4545-9166-0139 OF THEIR HATRED OF ONE ANOTHER OF WARS BATTLES INQUISITIONS MASSACRES
4545-9166-0140 SUCH MEDIATION IS NOT WANTED AND WAS DIRECTLY FORBIDDEN BY CHRIST WHO HAS REVEALED HIS TEACHING DIRECTLY AND IMMEDIATELY TO EACH MAN BUT THE CHURCHES SET UP DEAD FORMS IN THE PLACE OF GOD AND FAR FROM REVEALING GOD
4545-9166-0141 THEY OBSCURE HIM FROM MEN'S SIGHT THE CHURCHES WHICH ORIGINATED FROM MISUNDERSTANDING OF CHRIST'S TEACHING AND HAVE MAINTAINED THIS MISUNDERSTANDING BY THEIR IMMOVABILITY CANNOT BUT PERSECUTE AND REFUSE TO RECOGNIZE ALL TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF CHRIST'S WORDS
4545-9166-0142 THEY TRY TO CONCEAL THIS BUT IN VAIN FOR EVERY STEP FORWARD ALONG THE PATH POINTED OUT FOR US BY CHRIST IS A STEP TOWARD THEIR DESTRUCTION TO HEAR AND TO READ THE SERMONS AND ARTICLES IN WHICH CHURCH WRITERS OF LATER TIMES
4545-9166-0143 WHETHER THE CHURCHES CAN BE ANTAGONISTIC TO CHRISTIANITY IT CANNOT BE ONE SAYS THAT THESE PEOPLE WHO CAN POINT TO SUCH MEN AS CHRYSOSTOM FENELON BUTLER AND OTHERS PROFESSING THE CHRISTIAN FAITH WERE ANTAGONISTIC TO CHRISTIANITY ONE IS TEMPTED TO SAY
4545-9166-0144 THEY MAY BE IN ERROR BUT THEY CANNOT BE HOSTILE TO IT BUT WE MUST LOOK TO THE FRUIT TO JUDGE THE TREE AS CHRIST TAUGHT US
4545-9166-0145 THAT THE RESULTS OF THEIR ACTIVITY WERE ANTAGONISTIC TO CHRISTIANITY WE CANNOT BUT ADMIT THAT HOWEVER GOOD THE MEN WERE THE WORK OF THE CHURCH IN WHICH THESE MEN TOOK PART WAS NOT CHRISTIAN THE GOODNESS AND WORTH OF THESE MEN
4545-9166-0146 WHO SERVED THE CHURCHES WAS THE GOODNESS AND WORTH OF THE MEN AND NOT OF THE INSTITUTION THEY SERVED ALL THE GOOD MEN
4545-9166-0147 TIHON ZADONSKY THOMAS A KEMPIS AND OTHERS WERE GOOD MEN IN SPITE OF THEIR SERVING AN INSTITUTION HOSTILE TO CHRISTIANITY
4545-9166-0148 THE CHURCHES WITH THEIR PRINCIPLES AND THEIR PRACTICE ARE NOT A THING OF THE PAST THE CHURCHES ARE BEFORE US TO DAY AND WE CAN JUDGE OF THEM TO SOME PURPOSE BY THEIR PRACTICAL ACTIVITY THEIR INFLUENCE ON MEN
4545-9166-0149 WHAT IS THE PRACTICAL WORK OF THE CHURCHES TO DAY WHAT IS THEIR INFLUENCE UPON MEN WHAT IS DONE BY THE CHURCHES AMONG US AMONG THE CATHOLICS AND THE PROTESTANTS OF ALL DENOMINATIONS WHAT IS THEIR PRACTICAL WORK AND WHAT ARE THE RESULTS OF THEIR PRACTICAL WORK
4545-9166-0150 THE PRACTICE OF OUR RUSSIAN SO CALLED ORTHODOX CHURCH IS PLAIN TO ALL IT IS AN ENORMOUS FACT WHICH THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF HIDING AND ABOUT WHICH THERE CAN BE NO DISPUTING
