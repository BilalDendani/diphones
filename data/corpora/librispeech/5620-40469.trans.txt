5620-40469-0000 AT THIS THEY ALL LAUGHED MEEKLY I SAT DOWN AS WAS BEFITTING AND LISTENED TO THE TALK THEY CONVERSED IN BAD FRENCH OR WORSE ENGLISH
5620-40469-0001 SCOTCHMEN WHO HAD NEVER SEEN SCOTLAND AND NEVER WOULD DOUGLASSES AND BROWNS
5620-40469-0002 BUT COULD TAKE A LINER TO THE GULF DAY OR NIGHT THROUGH THE REEFS OF CRANE ISLAND PAST THE MENACING TWIN PILGRIMS BY WINDINGS AND DANGERS SAFE DOWN TO SEA I ASKED THE MAN WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO ORLEANS ISLAND FOR
5620-40469-0003 AND HE EXPLAINED THAT THEY LIVED THERE THROUGH THE WINTER MONTHS THEY AND OTHER PILOTS MANY OTHERS IT WAS A PILOT COLONY SET OUT IN MIDSTREAM
5620-40469-0004 SOMETIMES THEY DIDN'T COME ASHORE FOR WEEKS IT WAS NOT EXACTLY FUN FIGHTING THOSE ICE FLOES AND THEY ALL LAUGHED AGAIN WELL NOT EXACTLY MEANTIME SEVERAL JOLLY LITTLE CUTTERS NO HIGHER THAN CRADLES
5620-40469-0005 HAD JINGLED UP WITH MORE MEN IN FURS AND ONE WOMAN ALSO BOXES AND BUNDLES PILOTS I ASKED THE MAN NODDED AND THE WOMAN DEES LADY PILOT'S WIFE SHE BEEN SEEK AND HE WENT ON IN A JARGON THAT IS CHARMING BUT
5620-40469-0006 NOT FOR IMITATION TO EXPLAIN THAT THEY WOULD LAY THE SICK LADY IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT AND PILE COATS OVER HER AND AROUND HER
5620-40469-0007 FROM THE WAY HE SPOKE ONE WOULD FANCY THEY WERE ABOUT TO START FOR THE NORTH POLE BUT I PRESENTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS TWO MILE ICE JOURNEY OVER THE CRACKLING SAINT LAWRENCE
5620-40469-0008 IS ABOUT AS HARD A TEST OF MEN'S ENDURANCE AS ANY ARCTIC PERFORMANCE THEY WERE ALL GATHERED NOW SAVE ONE WHOSE CUTTER TARRIED STILL
5620-40469-0009 HE WAS A GOOD PILOT BUT OVERFOND OF THE CONVIVIAL GLASS AND WAS NO DOUBT THIS VERY MOMENT IN SOME UPROARIOUS COMPANY FORGETFUL THAT THE START WAS TO BE SHARP ON THE HOUR WELL THEY WOULD GIVE HIM TEN MINUTES MORE
5620-40469-0010 A PILOT IN COON SKINS WAS SURE IT WOULD COME THEY WOULD PUT ON ONE OF THESE NEW FANGLED ICE CRUNCHING STEAMERS TO KEEP THE MAIN CHANNEL OPEN
5620-40469-0011 A PILOT SIR MUST HAVE A CERTAIN TIME TO SMOKE HIS PIPE THEN ONE MAN TOLD WHAT THE ICE DID TO A SAILING VESSEL HE WAS TAKING DOWN THE RIVER LATE ONE SEASON HE HOPED NEVER TO TAKE ANOTHER DOWN SO LATE
5620-40469-0012 HE HAD GOT OUT OF HIS COURSE ONE NIGHT IN THE DANGEROUS WAYS OFF CRANE ISLAND AND FINALLY DROPPED ANCHOR TO HOLD HER AGAINST THE CRUSH OF ICE
5620-40469-0013 SO THERE THEY GO THROUGH THE ICE CHOKED RIVER
5620-40469-0014 SHOULDERS HEAVING OFF FOR HOME
5620-40469-0015 THEN ALL CLIMB OUT AND WITH DRAGGING AND PUSHING GET AHEAD FOR A HUNDRED FEET OR SO SEE NOW THEY STOP AND SWING THEIR ARMS ALREADY THE PITILESS WIND IS BITING THROUGH THEIR FURS AND THINK OF THAT POOR WOMAN
5620-40469-0016 THE STERN MAN STANDING BEHIND ON THE ICE TO PUSH OFF AND THEN WITH NICELY JUDGED EFFORT SPRING ABOARD AS HE GIVES THE LAST IMPULSE THAT SHOOTS HER INTO THE RIVER
5620-40469-0017 YES FOR THERE IS THIS ODD THING ABOUT THE SAINT LAWRENCE EVEN AT QUEBEC THAT ITS CURRENT STREAMS UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN AS THE TIDE CHANGES FOR SEVEN HOURS THE RIVER CONQUERS THE TIDE AND THE WATER RUNS DOWN TO SEA
5620-40469-0018 THEN FOR FIVE HOURS THE TIDE CONQUERS THE RIVER AND THE WATER RUNS UP FROM THE SEA SO NOW AFTER ALL THEIR TOILING THEY ARE ACTUALLY FURTHER FROM HOME THAN WHEN THEY STARTED
