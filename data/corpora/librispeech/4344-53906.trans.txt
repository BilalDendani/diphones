4344-53906-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN FRESH MORTIFICATIONS
4344-53906-0001 THE JOURNEY OF MY DAUGHTERS TO TOWN WAS NOW RESOLVED UPON MISTER THORNHILL HAVING KINDLY PROMISED TO INSPECT THEIR CONDUCT HIMSELF AND INFORM US BY LETTER OF THEIR BEHAVIOUR
4344-53906-0002 WHICH COULD NOT BE DONE WITHOUT EXPENCE
4344-53906-0003 THE DELIBERATION WAS SOON FINISHED IT WAS FOUND THAT OUR REMAINING HORSE WAS UTTERLY USELESS FOR THE PLOW WITHOUT HIS COMPANION AND EQUALLY UNFIT FOR THE ROAD AS WANTING AN EYE
4344-53906-0004 IT WAS THEREFORE DETERMINED THAT WE SHOULD DISPOSE OF HIM FOR THE PURPOSES ABOVE MENTIONED AT THE NEIGHBOURING FAIR AND TO PREVENT IMPOSITION THAT I SHOULD GO WITH HIM MYSELF THOUGH THIS WAS ONE OF THE FIRST MERCANTILE TRANSACTIONS OF MY LIFE
4344-53906-0005 YET I HAD NO DOUBT ABOUT ACQUITTING MYSELF WITH REPUTATION THE OPINION A MAN FORMS OF HIS OWN PRUDENCE IS MEASURED BY THAT OF THE COMPANY HE KEEPS
4344-53906-0006 MY WIFE HOWEVER NEXT MORNING AT PARTING AFTER I HAD GOT SOME PACES FROM THE DOOR CALLED ME BACK TO ADVISE ME IN A WHISPER TO HAVE ALL MY EYES ABOUT ME I HAD IN THE USUAL FORMS WHEN I CAME TO THE FAIR PUT MY HORSE THROUGH ALL HIS PACES
4344-53906-0007 BUT FOR SOME TIME HAD NO BIDDERS AT LAST A CHAPMAN APPROACHED AND AFTER HE HAD FOR A GOOD WHILE EXAMINED THE HORSE ROUND FINDING HIM BLIND OF ONE EYE HE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO HIM A SECOND CAME UP BUT OBSERVING HE HAD A SPAVIN
4344-53906-0008 DECLARED HE WOULD NOT TAKE HIM FOR THE DRIVING HOME
4344-53906-0009 A FOURTH KNEW BY HIS EYE THAT HE HAD THE BOTTS A FIFTH WONDERED WHAT A PLAGUE I COULD DO AT THE FAIR WITH A BLIND SPAVINED GALLED HACK THAT WAS ONLY FIT TO BE CUT UP FOR A DOG KENNEL BY THIS TIME I BEGAN TO HAVE A MOST HEARTY CONTEMPT FOR THE POOR ANIMAL MYSELF
4344-53906-0010 AND WAS ALMOST ASHAMED AT THE APPROACH OF EVERY CUSTOMER FOR THOUGH I DID NOT ENTIRELY BELIEVE ALL THE FELLOWS TOLD ME YET I REFLECTED THAT THE NUMBER OF WITNESSES WAS A STRONG PRESUMPTION THEY WERE RIGHT AND SAINT GREGORY UPON GOOD WORKS PROFESSES HIMSELF TO BE OF THE SAME OPINION
4344-53906-0011 I WAS IN THIS MORTIFYING SITUATION WHEN A BROTHER CLERGYMAN AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD ALSO BUSINESS TO THE FAIR CAME UP AND SHAKING ME BY THE HAND PROPOSED ADJOURNING TO A PUBLIC HOUSE AND TAKING A GLASS OF WHATEVER WE COULD GET
4344-53906-0012 I READILY CLOSED WITH THE OFFER AND ENTERING AN ALE HOUSE WE WERE SHEWN INTO A LITTLE BACK ROOM WHERE THERE WAS ONLY A VENERABLE OLD MAN WHO SAT WHOLLY INTENT OVER A LARGE BOOK WHICH HE WAS READING I NEVER IN MY LIFE SAW A FIGURE THAT PREPOSSESSED ME MORE FAVOURABLY
4344-53906-0013 HIS LOCKS OF SILVER GREY VENERABLY SHADED HIS TEMPLES AND HIS GREEN OLD AGE SEEMED TO BE THE RESULT OF HEALTH AND BENEVOLENCE HOWEVER HIS PRESENCE DID NOT INTERRUPT OUR CONVERSATION MY FRIEND AND I DISCOURSED ON THE VARIOUS TURNS OF FORTUNE WE HAD MET
4344-53906-0014 THE WHISTONEAN CONTROVERSY MY LAST PAMPHLET THE ARCHDEACON'S REPLY AND THE HARD MEASURE THAT WAS DEALT ME BUT OUR ATTENTION WAS IN A SHORT TIME TAKEN OFF BY THE APPEARANCE OF A YOUTH WHO ENTERING THE ROOM RESPECTFULLY SAID SOMETHING SOFTLY TO THE OLD STRANGER
4344-53906-0015 MAKE NO APOLOGIES MY CHILD SAID THE OLD MAN TO DO GOOD IS A DUTY WE OWE TO ALL OUR FELLOW CREATURES TAKE THIS I WISH IT WERE MORE BUT FIVE POUNDS WILL RELIEVE YOUR DISTRESS AND YOU ARE WELCOME THE MODEST YOUTH SHED TEARS OF GRATITUDE
4344-53906-0016 AND YET HIS GRATITUDE WAS SCARCE EQUAL TO MINE I COULD HAVE HUGGED THE GOOD OLD MAN IN MY ARMS HIS BENEVOLENCE PLEASED ME SO HE CONTINUED TO READ AND WE RESUMED OUR CONVERSATION UNTIL MY COMPANION AFTER SOME TIME RECOLLECTING THAT HE HAD BUSINESS TO TRANSACT IN THE FAIR
4344-53906-0017 ADDING THAT HE ALWAYS DESIRED TO HAVE AS MUCH OF DOCTOR PRIMROSE'S COMPANY AS POSSIBLE THE OLD GENTLEMAN HEARING MY NAME MENTIONED SEEMED TO LOOK AT ME WITH ATTENTION FOR SOME TIME AND WHEN MY FRIEND WAS GONE MOST RESPECTFULLY DEMANDED IF I WAS ANY WAY RELATED TO THE GREAT PRIMROSE
4344-53906-0018 THAT COURAGEOUS MONOGAMIST WHO HAD BEEN THE BULWARK OF THE CHURCH NEVER DID MY HEART FEEL SINCERER RAPTURE THAN AT THAT MOMENT SIR CRIED I THE APPLAUSE OF SO GOOD A MAN AS I AM SURE YOU ARE
4344-53906-0019 ADDS TO THAT HAPPINESS IN MY BREAST WHICH YOUR BENEVOLENCE HAS ALREADY EXCITED YOU BEHOLD BEFORE YOU SIR THAT DOCTOR PRIMROSE THE MONOGAMIST WHOM YOU HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO CALL GREAT YOU HERE SEE THAT UNFORTUNATE DIVINE WHO HAS SO LONG
4344-53906-0020 SIR CRIED THE STRANGER STRUCK WITH AWE I FEAR I HAVE BEEN TOO FAMILIAR BUT YOU'LL FORGIVE MY CURIOSITY SIR I BEG PARDON SIR CRIED I GRASPING HIS HAND YOU ARE SO FAR FROM DISPLEASING ME BY YOUR FAMILIARITY THAT I MUST BEG YOU'LL ACCEPT MY FRIENDSHIP
4344-53906-0021 AS YOU ALREADY HAVE MY ESTEEM
4344-53906-0022 CRIED HE SQUEEZING ME BY THE HAND THOU GLORIOUS PILLAR OF UNSHAKEN ORTHODOXY AND DO I BEHOLD I HERE INTERRUPTED WHAT HE WAS GOING TO SAY FOR THO AS AN AUTHOR I COULD DIGEST NO SMALL SHARE OF FLATTERY YET NOW MY MODESTY WOULD PERMIT NO MORE
4344-53906-0023 HOWEVER NO LOVERS IN ROMANCE EVER CEMENTED A MORE INSTANTANEOUS FRIENDSHIP WE TALKED UPON SEVERAL SUBJECTS AT FIRST I THOUGHT HE SEEMED RATHER DEVOUT THAN LEARNED AND BEGAN TO THINK HE DESPISED ALL HUMAN DOCTRINES AS DROSS
4344-53906-0024 YET THIS NO WAY LESSENED HIM IN MY ESTEEM FOR I HAD FOR SOME TIME BEGUN PRIVATELY TO HARBOUR SUCH AN OPINION MYSELF I THEREFORE TOOK OCCASION TO OBSERVE THAT THE WORLD IN GENERAL BEGAN TO BE BLAMEABLY INDIFFERENT AS TO DOCTRINAL MATTERS AND FOLLOWED HUMAN SPECULATIONS TOO MUCH
4344-53906-0025 AY SIR THE WORLD IS IN ITS DOTAGE AND YET THE COSMOGONY OR CREATION OF THE WORLD HAS PUZZLED PHILOSOPHERS OF ALL AGES WHAT A MEDLY OF OPINIONS HAVE THEY NOT BROACHED UPON THE CREATION OF THE WORLD
4344-53906-0026 HAVE ALL ATTEMPTED IT IN VAIN THE LATTER HAS THESE WORDS
4344-53906-0027 WHICH IMPLY THAT ALL THINGS HAVE NEITHER BEGINNING NOR END
4344-53906-0028 ASSER BEING A SYRIAC WORD USUALLY APPLIED AS A SIRNAME TO THE KINGS OF THAT COUNTRY
4344-53906-0029 WHICH IMPLIES THAT BOOKS WILL NEVER TEACH THE WORLD SO HE ATTEMPTED TO INVESTIGATE BUT SIR I ASK PARDON I AM STRAYING FROM THE QUESTION THAT HE ACTUALLY WAS
4344-53906-0030 ANY THING TO DO WITH THE BUSINESS I WAS TALKING OF
4344-53906-0031 AND I NOW REVERENCED HIM THE MORE I WAS RESOLVED THEREFORE TO BRING HIM TO THE TOUCH STONE BUT HE WAS TOO MILD AND TOO GENTLE TO CONTEND FOR VICTORY
4344-53906-0032 HE WOULD SMILE SHAKE HIS HEAD AND SAY NOTHING BY WHICH I UNDERSTOOD HE COULD SAY MUCH IF HE THOUGHT PROPER THE SUBJECT THEREFORE INSENSIBLY CHANGED FROM THE BUSINESS OF ANTIQUITY
4344-53906-0033 MINE I TOLD HIM WAS TO SELL AN HORSE AND VERY LUCKILY INDEED HIS WAS TO BUY ONE FOR ONE OF HIS TENANTS MY HORSE WAS SOON PRODUCED AND IN FINE WE STRUCK A BARGAIN NOTHING NOW REMAINED BUT TO PAY ME
4344-53906-0034 AND HE ACCORDINGLY PULLED OUT A THIRTY POUND NOTE AND BID ME CHANGE IT NOT BEING IN A CAPACITY OF COMPLYING WITH HIS DEMAND HE ORDERED HIS FOOTMAN TO BE CALLED UP WHO MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN A VERY GENTEEL LIVERY HERE ABRAHAM CRIED HE
4344-53906-0035 GO AND GET GOLD FOR THIS YOU'LL DO IT AT NEIGHBOUR JACKSON'S OR ANY WHERE WHILE THE FELLOW WAS GONE HE ENTERTAINED ME WITH A PATHETIC HARANGUE ON THE GREAT SCARCITY OF SILVER WHICH I UNDERTOOK TO IMPROVE BY DEPLORING ALSO THE GREAT SCARCITY OF GOLD
4344-53906-0036 SO THAT BY THE TIME ABRAHAM RETURNED WE HAD BOTH AGREED THAT MONEY WAS NEVER SO HARD TO BE COME AT AS NOW ABRAHAM RETURNED TO INFORM US THAT HE HAD BEEN OVER THE WHOLE FAIR AND COULD NOT GET CHANGE THO HE HAD OFFERED HALF A CROWN FOR DOING IT
4344-53906-0037 THIS WAS A VERY GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT TO US ALL BUT THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAVING PAUSED A LITTLE ASKED ME IF I KNEW ONE SOLOMON FLAMBOROUGH IN MY PART OF THE COUNTRY UPON REPLYING THAT HE WAS MY NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR
4344-53906-0038 IF THAT BE THE CASE THEN RETURNED HE I BELIEVE WE SHALL DEAL YOU SHALL HAVE A DRAUGHT UPON HIM PAYABLE AT SIGHT AND LET ME TELL YOU HE IS AS WARM A MAN AS ANY WITHIN FIVE MILES ROUND HIM HONEST SOLOMON AND I HAVE BEEN ACQUAINTED FOR MANY YEARS TOGETHER
4344-53906-0039 A DRAUGHT UPON MY NEIGHBOUR WAS TO ME THE SAME AS MONEY FOR I WAS SUFFICIENTLY CONVINCED OF HIS ABILITY THE DRAUGHT WAS SIGNED AND PUT INTO MY HANDS AND MISTER JENKINSON THE OLD GENTLEMAN HIS MAN ABRAHAM AND MY HORSE OLD BLACKBERRY
4344-53906-0040 TROTTED OFF VERY WELL PLEASED WITH EACH OTHER AFTER A SHORT INTERVAL BEING LEFT TO REFLECTION I BEGAN TO RECOLLECT THAT I HAD DONE WRONG IN TAKING A DRAUGHT FROM A STRANGER AND SO PRUDENTLY RESOLVED UPON FOLLOWING THE PURCHASER AND HAVING BACK MY HORSE
4344-53906-0041 BUT THIS WAS NOW TOO LATE I THEREFORE MADE DIRECTLY HOMEWARDS RESOLVING TO GET THE DRAUGHT CHANGED INTO MONEY AT MY FRIEND'S AS FAST AS POSSIBLE I FOUND MY HONEST NEIGHBOUR SMOKING HIS PIPE AT HIS OWN DOOR
4344-53906-0042 HE READ IT TWICE OVER YOU CAN READ THE NAME I SUPPOSE CRIED I EPHRAIM JENKINSON
4344-53906-0043 THE NAME IS WRITTEN PLAIN ENOUGH AND I KNOW THE GENTLEMAN TOO THE GREATEST RASCAL UNDER THE CANOPY OF HEAVEN THIS IS THE VERY SAME ROGUE WHO SOLD US THE SPECTACLES WAS HE NOT A VENERABLE LOOKING MAN WITH GREY HAIR AND NO FLAPS TO HIS POCKET HOLES
4344-53906-0044 TO THIS I REPLIED WITH A GROAN AYE
4344-53906-0045 BUT I KNOW THE ROGUE AND WILL CATCH HIM YET THOUGH I WAS ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY MORTIFIED MY GREATEST STRUGGLE WAS TO COME IN FACING MY WIFE AND DAUGHTERS NO TRUANT WAS EVER MORE AFRAID OF RETURNING TO SCHOOL THERE TO BEHOLD THE MASTER'S VISAGE
4344-53906-0046 THAN I WAS OF GOING HOME I WAS DETERMINED HOWEVER TO ANTICIPATE THEIR FURY BY FIRST FALLING INTO A PASSION MYSELF BUT ALAS UPON ENTERING I FOUND THE FAMILY NO WAY DISPOSED FOR BATTLE MY WIFE AND GIRLS WERE ALL IN TEARS
4344-53906-0047 MISTER THORNHILL HAVING BEEN THERE THAT DAY TO INFORM THEM THAT THEIR JOURNEY TO TOWN WAS ENTIRELY OVER THE TWO LADIES HAVING HEARD REPORTS OF US FROM SOME MALICIOUS PERSON ABOUT US WERE THAT DAY SET OUT FOR LONDON HE COULD NEITHER DISCOVER THE TENDENCY NOR THE AUTHOR OF THESE
4344-53906-0048 BUT WHATEVER THEY MIGHT BE OR WHOEVER MIGHT HAVE BROACHED THEM HE CONTINUED TO ASSURE OUR FAMILY OF HIS FRIENDSHIP AND PROTECTION
