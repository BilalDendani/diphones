4039-184265-0000 THEY SET HIM CONUNDRUMS TO GUESS WHEN AT LENGTH HE SAT UP AND WAS ABLE TO SPEAK HIS SAD STORY HE OFFERED TO TELL AND THE BELLMAN CRIED SILENCE NOT EVEN A SHRIEK
4039-184265-0001 AND EXCITEDLY TINGLED HIS BELL THERE WAS SILENCE SUPREME NOT A SHRIEK NOT A SCREAM SCARCELY EVEN A HOWL OR A GROAN AS THE MAN THEY CALLED HO
4039-184265-0002 TOLD HIS STORY OF WOE IN AN ANTEDILUVIAN TONE MY FATHER AND MOTHER WERE
4039-184265-0003 TO WASTE I SKIP FORTY YEARS SAID THE BAKER IN TEARS AND PROCEED WITHOUT FURTHER REMARK TO THE DAY WHEN YOU TOOK ME ABOARD OF YOUR SHIP TO HELP YOU IN HUNTING THE SNARK
4039-184265-0004 A DEAR UNCLE OF MINE AFTER WHOM I WAS NAMED REMARKED WHEN I BADE HIM FAREWELL OH SKIP YOUR DEAR UNCLE THE BELLMAN EXCLAIMED AS HE ANGRILY TINGLED HIS BELL
4039-184265-0005 HE REMARKED TO ME THEN SAID THAT MILDEST OF MEN IF YOUR SNARK BE A SNARK THAT IS RIGHT FETCH IT HOME BY ALL MEANS YOU MAY SERVE IT WITH GREENS AND IT'S HANDY FOR STRIKING A LIGHT
4039-184265-0006 YOU MAY SEEK IT WITH THIMBLES AND SEEK IT WITH CARE YOU MAY HUNT IT WITH FORKS AND HOPE YOU MAY THREATEN ITS LIFE WITH A RAILWAY SHARE YOU MAY CHARM IT WITH SMILES
4039-184265-0007 AND SOAP THAT'S EXACTLY THE METHOD THE BELLMAN BOLD IN A HASTY PARENTHESIS CRIED THAT'S EXACTLY THE WAY I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TOLD THAT THE CAPTURE OF SNARKS SHOULD BE TRIED BUT OH BEAMISH NEPHEW

4039-184265-0010 IN A DREAMY DELIRIOUS FIGHT I SERVE IT WITH GREENS IN THOSE SHADOWY SCENES AND I USE IT FOR STRIKING A LIGHT
4039-184265-0011 BUT IF EVER I MEET WITH A BOOJUM THAT DAY IN A MOMENT OF THIS I AM SURE I SHALL SOFTLY AND SUDDENLY VANISH AWAY AND THE NOTION I CANNOT ENDURE
4039-184265-0012 IT'S EXCESSIVELY AWKWARD TO MENTION IT NOW WITH THE SNARK SO TO SPEAK AT THE DOOR WE SHOULD ALL OF US GRIEVE AS YOU WELL MAY BELIEVE IF YOU NEVER WERE MET WITH AGAIN BUT SURELY MY MAN
4039-184265-0013 WHEN THE VOYAGE BEGAN YOU MIGHT HAVE SUGGESTED IT THEN IT'S EXCESSIVELY AWKWARD TO MENTION IT NOW AS I THINK I'VE ALREADY REMARKED AND THE MAN THEY CALLED HI REPLIED WITH A SIGH

4039-184265-0020 THOUGH THE BARRISTER TRIED TO APPEAL TO ITS PRIDE AND VAINLY PROCEEDED TO CITE A NUMBER OF CASES IN WHICH MAKING LACES
4039-184265-0021 THE MAKER OF BONNETS FEROCIOUSLY PLANNED A NOVEL ARRANGEMENT OF BOWS WHILE THE BILLIARD MARKER WITH QUIVERING HAND WAS CHALKING THE TIP OF HIS NOSE BUT THE BUTCHER TURNED NERVOUS
