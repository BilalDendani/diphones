4420-5802-0000 AND WALLACE TRUSTING HIS VEHEMENT OATHS OF FIDELITY BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THE VERSATILE EARL HAD NOW DISCOVERED HIS TRUE INTEREST GRANTED HIM CHARGE OF THE LOTHIANS
4420-5802-0001 WERE NOT BACKWARD IN OFFERING THEIR SERVICES TO THE REGENT AND THE REST OF THE DISCONTENTED NOBLES FOLLOWING THE BASE EXAMPLE WITH EQUAL DECEIT BADE HIM COMMAND THEIR LIVES AND FORTUNES
4420-5802-0002 WHILE ASSEVERATIONS OF LOYALTY FILLED THE WALLS OF THE COUNCIL HALL AND THE LAUDING REJOICINGS OF THE PEOPLE STILL SOUNDED FROM WITHOUT ALL SPOKE OF SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE TO WALLACE
4420-5802-0003 AND NEVER PERHAPS DID HE THINK HIMSELF SO ABSOLUTE IN THE HEART OF SCOTLAND AS AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THREE FOURTHS OF ITS NOBILITY WERE PLOTTING HIS DESTRUCTION LORD LOCH AWE
4420-5802-0004 KNEW HIS OWN INFLUENCE IN THE MINDS OF THE BRAVEST CHIEFTAINS FROM THE EXTENT OF HIS TERRITORIES AND HIS TRIED VALOR
4420-5802-0005 AND BEEN CALLED KING OF WOODY MORVEN BUT HE WAS CONTENT WITH A PATRIARCH'S SWAY OVER SO MANY VALIANT CLANS AND PREVIOUS TO THE REGENT'S APPEARANCE IN THE COUNCIL HALL HE OPENED HIS INTENTIONS TO THE ASSEMBLED LORDS
4420-5802-0006 THE REST READILY ACQUIESCED IN WHAT THEY HAD LAID SO SURE A PLAN TO CIRCUMVENT WALLACE SOON AFTER ENTERED
4420-5802-0007 STOOD FORTH BEFORE HIM AND IN A LONG AND PERSUASIVE SPEECH ONCE MORE DECLARED THE WISHES OF THE NATION THAT HE WOULD STRIKE THE DECISIVE BLOW ON THE PRETENSIONS OF EDWARD BY HIMSELF ACCEPTING THE CROWN
4420-5802-0008 THE BISHOP OF DUNKELD
4420-5802-0009 AND THE MOST ANIMATED DEVOTION TO THE INTEREST OF SCOTLAND SECONDED THE PETITION MAR AND BOTHWELL ENFORCED IT THE DISAFFECTED LORDS THOUGHT PROPER TO THROW IN THEIR CONJURATIONS ALSO
4420-5802-0010 FERVENT ENTREATIES THAT HE THEIR LIBERATOR WOULD GRANT THE SUPPLICATION OF THE NATION WALLACE ROSE AND EVERY TONGUE WAS MUTE MY GRATITUDE TO SCOTLAND
4420-5802-0011 INCREASES WITH MY LIFE BUT MY ANSWER MUST STILL BE THE SAME I CANNOT BE ITS KING AT THESE WORDS THE VENERABLE LOCH AWE THREW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE HIM
4420-5802-0012 IN MY PERSON CRIED HE SEE SCOTLAND AT YOUR FEET STILL BLEEDING WITH THE EFFECTS OF FORMER STRUGGLES FOR EMPIRE SHE WOULD THROW OFF ALL CLAIMS BUT THOSE OF VIRTUE AND RECEIVE AS HER ANOINTED SOVEREIGN
4420-5802-0013 HER FATHER AND DELIVERER SHE HAS NO MORE ARGUMENTS TO UTTER THESE ARE HER PRAYERS AND THUS I OFFER THEM KNEEL NOT TO ME BRAVE LOCH AWE CRIED WALLACE
4420-5802-0014 NOR BELIEVE THE MIGHT OF THESE VICTORIES LIES SO THOROUGHLY ON THIS ARM THAT I DARE OUTRAGE ITS MAKER WERE I TO COMPLY WITH YOUR WISHES I SHOULD DISOBEY HIM WHO HAS HITHERTO MADE ME HIS HAPPY AGENT
4420-5802-0015 AND HOW COULD I GUARD MY KINGDOM FROM HIS VENGEANCE YOUR RIGHTFUL KING YET LIVES HE IS AN ALIEN FROM HIS COUNTRY BUT HEAVEN MAY RETURN HIM TO YOUR PRAYERS MEANWHILE AS HIS REPRESENTATIVE
4420-5802-0016 AS YOUR SOLDIER AND PROTECTOR I SHALL BE BLESSED IN WEARING OUT MY LIFE MY ANCESTORS WERE EVER FAITHFUL TO THE BLOOD OF ALEXANDER AND IN THE SAME FIDELITY I WILL DIE
4420-5802-0017 THE FIRMNESS WITH WHICH HE SPOKE AND THE DETERMINED EXPRESSION OF HIS NOBLE COUNTENANCE CONVINCED LOCH AWE THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN AND RISING FROM HIS KNEE HE BOWED IN SILENCE MARCH
4420-5802-0018 WHISPERED TO BUCHAN BEHOLD THE HYPOCRITE BUT WE SHALL UNMASK HIM HE THINKS TO BLIND US TO HIS TOWERING AMBITION BY THIS AFFECTED MODERATION HE WILL NOT BE CALLED A KING BECAUSE
4420-5802-0019 BUT HE WILL BE OUR REGENT THAT HE MAY BE OUR DICTATOR AND EVERY DAY DEMAND GRATITUDE FOR VOLUNTARY SERVICES WHICH PERFORMED AS A KING COULD ONLY BE CONSIDERED AS HIS DUTY WHEN THE COUNCIL BROKE UP
4420-5802-0020 THESE SENTIMENTS WERE ACTIVELY DISSEMINATED AMONG THE DISAFFECTED THRONG AND EACH GLOOMY RECESS IN THE WOODS MURMURED WITH SEDITIOUS MEETINGS BUT EVERY LIP IN THE COUNTRY AT LARGE BREATHED THE NAME OF WALLACE
4420-5802-0021 WHILE THE LAND THAT HE HAD BLESSED BLOOMED ON EVERY HILL AND VALLEY LIKE A GARDEN STIRLING NOW EXHIBITED A CONSTANT CARNIVAL PEACE WAS IN EVERY HEART AND JOY ITS COMPANION
4420-5802-0022 AS WALLACE HAD COMMANDED IN THE FIELD HE DECIDED IN THE JUDGMENT HALL AND WHILE ALL HIS BEHESTS WERE OBEYED WITH A PROMPTITUDE WHICH KEPT THE MACHINE OF STATE CONSTANTLY MOVING IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ORDER HIS BITTEREST ENEMIES
4420-5802-0023 COULD NOT BUT SECRETLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERFECTION THEY WERE DETERMINED TO DESTROY HIS MUNIFICENT HAND STRETCHED ITSELF FAR AND NEAR THAT ALL WHO HAD SHARED THE SUFFERINGS OF SCOTLAND MIGHT DRINK LARGELY OF HER PROSPERITY
4420-5802-0024 THE GOOD ABBOT OF SCONE WAS INVITED FROM HIS HERMITAGE AND WHEN HE HEARD FROM THE EMBASSADORS SENT TO HIM THAT THE BRAVE YOUNG WARRIOR WHOM HE HAD ENTERTAINED WAS THE RESISTLESS WALLACE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF THE DISTANT
4420-5802-0025 AND SUPINE BRUCE BUT CENTERED EVERY WISH FOR HIS COUNTRY
4420-5802-0026 A FEW DAYS BROUGHT HIM TO STIRLING AND WISHING TO REMAIN NEAR THE MOST CONSTANT RESIDENCE OF HIS NOBLE FRIEND HE REQUESTED THAT INSTEAD OF BEING RESTORED TO SCONE HE MIGHT BE INSTALLED
4420-5802-0027 IN THE VACANT MONASTERY OF CAMBUS KENNETH WALLACE GLADLY ACQUIESCED AND THE VENERABLE ABBOT BEING TOLD THAT HIS LATE CHARGE THE LADY HELEN WAS IN THE PALACE WENT TO VISIT HER
4420-5802-0028 AND AS HE COMMUNICATED HIS EXULTATION AND HAPPINESS SHE REJOICED IN THE BENEDICTIONS WHICH HIS GRATEFUL SPIRIT INVOKED ON THE HEAD OF HER ALMOST WORSHIPED SOVEREIGN HER HEART GAVE HIM HIS TITLE
4420-5802-0029 WHICH SHE BELIEVED THE NOT TO BE REPRESSED AFFECTION OF THE PEOPLE WOULD AT LAST FORCE HIM TO ACCEPT THE WIVES AND FAMILIES OF THE LANARK VETERANS WERE BROUGHT FROM LOCH DOINE AND AGAIN PLANTED IN THEIR NATIVE VALLEYS
4420-5802-0030 THUS NAUGHT IN THE KINGDOM APPEARED DIFFERENT FROM ITS MOST PROSPEROUS DAYS BUT THE WIDOWED HEART OF THE DISPENSER OF ALL THIS GOOD AND YET SO FULLY DID HE ENGAGE HIMSELF IN THE CREATION OF THESE BENEFITS
4420-5802-0031 THAT NO TIME SEEMED LEFT TO HIM FOR REGRETS BUT THEY HAUNTED HIM LIKE PERSECUTING SPIRITS INVISIBLE TO ALL BUT HIMSELF DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE THINGS THE COUNTESS OF MAR
4420-5802-0032 WAS ABSORBED IN THE ONE GREAT OBJECT OF HER PASSION EAGER TO BE RID OF SO DANGEROUS A SPY AND ADVERSARY AS SHE DEEMED EDWIN TO BE
4420-5802-0033 SHE WAS LABORING DAY AND NIGHT TO EFFECT BY CLANDESTINE SCHEMES HIS BANISHMENT WHEN AN UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCE CARRIED HIM FAR AWAY LORD RUTHVEN WHILE ON AN EMBASSY
4420-5802-0034 TO THE HEBRIDES FELL ILL AS HIS DISORDER WAS ATTENDED WITH EXTREME DANGER HE SENT FOR HIS WIFE AND EDWIN IMPELLED BY LOVE FOR HIS FATHER AND ANXIETY TO SOOTHE THE TERRIFIED SUSPENSE OF HIS MOTHER
4420-5802-0035 READILY LEFT THE SIDE OF HIS FRIEND TO ACCOMPANY HER TO THE ISLES LADY MAR HAD NOW NO SCRUTINIZING EYE TO FEAR HER NEPHEW MURRAY WAS STILL ON DUTY IN CLYDESDALE
4420-5802-0036 THE EARL HER HUSBAND TRUSTED HER TOO IMPLICITLY EVEN TO TURN ON HER A SUSPICIOUS LOOK AND HELEN SHE CONTRIVED SHOULD BE AS LITTLE IN HER PRESENCE AS POSSIBLE BUSY THEN AS THIS LADY WAS
4420-5802-0037 THE ENEMIES OF THE REGENT WERE NOT LESS ACTIVE IN THE PROSECUTION OF THEIR PLANS THE EARL OF MARCH HAD ARRIVED AT DUNBAR AND HAVING DISPATCHED HIS TREASONABLE PROPOSALS TO EDWARD
4420-5802-0038 ACCEPTING HIS SERVICES AND PROMISING EVERY REWARD THAT COULD SATISFY HIS AMBITION AND THE CUPIDITY OF THOSE WHOM HE COULD DRAW OVER TO HIS CAUSE THE WARY KING THEN TOLD THE EARL
4420-5802-0039 THAT IF HE WOULD SEND HIS WIFE AND FAMILY TO LONDON AS HOSTAGES FOR HIS FAITH HE WAS READY TO BRING A MIGHTY ARMY TO DUNBAR AND BY THAT GATE ONCE MORE ENTER SCOTLAND
4420-5802-0040 THESE NEGOTIATIONS BACKWARD AND FORWARD FROM LONDON TO DUNBAR AND FROM DUNBAR TO THE TREACHEROUS LORDS AT STIRLING OCCUPIED MUCH TIME AND THE MORE AS GREAT PRECAUTION WAS NECESSARY
4420-5802-0041 TO ESCAPE THE VIGILANT EYES OF WALLACE WHICH SEEMED TO BE PRESENT IN EVERY PART OF THE KINGDOM AT ONCE SO CAREFUL WAS HE IN OVERLOOKING BY HIS WELL CHOSEN OFFICERS CIVIL AND MILITARY EVERY TRANSACTION
4420-5802-0042 THAT THE SLIGHTEST DERELICTION FROM THE STRAIGHT ORDER OF THINGS WAS IMMEDIATELY SEEN AND EXAMINED INTO MANY OF THESE TRUSTY MAGISTRATES HAVING BEEN PLACED IN THE LOTHIANS BEFORE MARCH TOOK THE GOVERNMENT
4420-5802-0043 AND THEREFORE AS THEY REMAINED GREAT CIRCUMSPECTION WAS USED TO ELUDE THEIR WATCHFULNESS FROM THE TIME THAT EDWARD HAD AGAIN ENTERED INTO TERMS WITH THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS LORD MARCH
4420-5802-0044 SENT REGULAR TIDINGS TO LORD SOULIS OF THE PROGRESS OF THEIR NEGOTIATIONS HE KNEW THAT NOBLEMAN WOULD GLADLY WELCOME THE RECALL OF THE KING OF ENGLAND
4420-5802-0045 FOR EVER SINCE THE REVOLUTION IN FAVOR OF SCOTLAND HE HAD REMAINED OBSTINATELY SHUT UP WITHIN HIS CASTLE OF HERMITAGE
4420-5802-0046 AND THE WOUNDS HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE INVISIBLE HAND WHICH HAD RELEASED HER HAVING BEEN GIVEN WITH ALL THE MIGHT OF THE VALIANT ARM WHICH DIRECTED THE BLOW WERE NOT EVEN NOW HEALED HIS PASSIONS
4420-5802-0047 KEPT THEM STILL INFLAMED AND THEIR SMART MADE HIS VENGEANCE BURN THE FIERCER AGAINST WALLACE WHO HE NOW LEARNED WAS THE MYSTERIOUS AGENT OF HER RESCUE
4420-5802-0048 WHILE TREASON SECRETLY PREPARED TO SPRING ITS MINE BENEATH THE FEET OF THE REGENT HE UNSUSPICIOUS THAT ANY COULD BE DISCONTENTED WHERE ALL WERE FREE AND PROSPEROUS
4420-5802-0049 THOUGHT OF NO ENEMY TO THE TRANQUIL FULFILLMENT OF HIS DUTIES BUT THE MINOR PERSECUTIONS OF LADY MAR
4420-5802-0050 EITHER TO INVITE HIM TO SNAWDOUN OR TO LEAD HER TO THE CITADEL WHERE HE RESIDED IN EVERY ONE OF THESE EPISTLES
4420-5802-0051 WHICH IMPELLED HER TO SEEK HIS SOCIETY BUT THE MODERATED REGARD OF A FRIEND AND THOUGH PERFECTLY AWARE OF ALL THAT WAS BEHIND THESE ASSEVERATIONS FOR SHE HAD DECEIVED HIM ONCE INTO A BELIEF OF THIS PLEASE
4420-5802-0052 AND HAD MADE HIM FEEL ITS FALSENESS HE FOUND HIMSELF FORCED AT TIMES OUT OF THE CIVILITY DUE TO HER SEX TO COMPLY WITH HER INVITATIONS INDEED
4420-5802-0053 HER CONDUCT NEVER GAVE HIM REASON TO HOLD HER IN ANY HIGHER RESPECT FOR WHENEVER THEY HAPPENED TO BE LEFT ALONE SHE MADE PRETENSIONS THE FREQUENCY OF THESE SCENES AT LAST MADE HIM NEVER GO TO SNAWDOUN UNACCOMPANIED
4420-5802-0054 FOR SHE RARELY ALLOWED HIM TO HAVE EVEN A GLIMPSE OF HELEN AND BY THIS PRECAUTION HE AVOIDED MUCH OF HER SOLICITATIONS BUT STRANGE TO SAY
4420-5802-0055 BY DRIVING HER TO DESPAIR MIGHT HAVE EXCITED HER TO SOME DESPERATE ACT HER WAYWARD HEART THREW THE BLAME OF HIS COLDNESS UPON HER TRAMMELS WITH LORD MAR AND FLATTERING HERSELF
4420-5802-0056 THAT WERE HE DEAD ALL WOULD HAPPEN AS SHE WISHED SHE PANTED FOR THAT HOUR WITH AN IMPATIENCE WHICH OFTEN TEMPTED HER TO PRECIPITATE THE EVENT THINGS WERE IN THIS SITUATION WHEN WALLACE ONE NIGHT
4420-5802-0057 RECEIVED A HASTY SUMMONS FROM HIS PILLOW BY A PAGE OF LORD MAR'S REQUESTING HIM TO IMMEDIATELY REPAIR TO HIS CHAMBER CONCLUDING THAT SOMETHING ALARMING MUST HAVE HAPPENED

4420-5802-0061 HE LEAD THE CHIEF INTO THE ROOM WHERE HELEN SAT LIKE SOME FAIRY SPECTER OF THE NIGHT HER LONG HAIR DISORDERED BY THE WINDS OF A NOCTURNAL STORM MINGLING WITH THE GRAY FOLDS OF THE MANTLE WHICH ENVELOPED HER
4420-5802-0062 WALLACE HASTENED FORWARD SHE NOW NO LONGER FLITTED AWAY SCARED FROM HIS APPROACH BY THE FROWNING GLANCES OF HER STEP MOTHER HE HAD ONCE ATTEMPTED
4420-5802-0063 TO EXPRESS HIS GRATEFUL REGRETS FOR WHAT SHE HAD SUFFERED IN HER LOVELY PERSON FOR HIS SAKE BUT THE COUNTESS HAD THEN INTERRUPTED HIM AND HELEN DISAPPEARED NOW HE BEHELD HER IN A PRESENCE
4420-5802-0064 WHERE HE COULD DECLARE ALL HIS GRATITUDE WITHOUT SUBJECTING ITS GENTLE OBJECT TO ONE HARSH WORD IN CONSEQUENCE AND ALMOST FORGETTING HIS ERRAND TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE TIDINGS HE HAD JUST HEARD
4420-5802-0065 HE REMEMBERED ONLY THE MANNER IN WHICH SHE HAD SHIELDED HIS LIFE WITH HER ARMS AND HE BENT HIS KNEE RESPECTFULLY BEFORE HER AS SHE ROSE TO HIS APPROACH BLUSHING AND SILENT SHE EXTENDED HER HAND TO HIM
