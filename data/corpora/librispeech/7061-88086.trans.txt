7061-88086-0000 A BASKET OF FISH FRESH AND TENDER THE LIGHT OF THE MILD SPRING AFTERNOON CARESSED THE LITTLE ABANDONED CLEARING IN THE WILDERNESS AT THE BACK OF THE CLEARING BENEATH A SOLITARY WHITE BIRCH TREE
7061-88086-0001 JUST BURSTING INTO GREEN STOOD A SQUATTER'S LOG CABIN LONG DESERTED ITS DOOR AND WINDOW GONE ITS ROOF OF POLES AND BARK HALF FALLEN IN
7061-88086-0002 PAST THE FOOT OF THE CLEARING WITH DANCING SPARKLE AND A CRISP MUSICAL CLAMOR RAN A SHALLOW STREAM SOME DOZEN YARDS IN WIDTH ITS CLEAR WATERS AMBER TAWNY FROM THE FAR OFF CEDAR SWAMPS IN WHICH IT TOOK ITS RISE
7061-88086-0003 ALONG ONE SIDE CAME THE DEEPLY RUTTED BACKWOODS ROAD SKIRTING THE CLEARING AND MAKING ITS PRECARIOUS WAY ACROSS THE STREAM BY A RUDE BRIDGE NOT LIGHTLY TO BE VENTURED AFTER DARK
7061-88086-0004 FROM BEHIND A CORNER OF THE RUINED CABIN PEERED CRAFTILY A RED FOX HE EYED THE WAGON HE EYED THE HORSE BENEATH THE BIRCH TREE HE SCRUTINIZED THE WHOLE CLEARING THE ROAD
7061-88086-0005 AND THE OPEN STRETCH OF THE STREAM THEN HIS NARROWED SEARCHING GAZE RETURNED TO THE WAGON AND TO THE FAT BASKET IN THE BACK OF THE WAGON AT LENGTH HE STEPPED FORTH MINCINGLY INTO FULL VIEW
7061-88086-0006 TROTTED UP AND SNIFFED INQUISITIVELY AS IF IN DOUBT HE RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS HIND LEGS WITH HIS FORE PAWS ON THE TIRE OF THE NEAREST WHEEL AND TOOK A LONG SATISFYING SNIFF
7061-88086-0007 AND ANYHOW HE SAW THAT THE HORSE WAS TETHERED TO THE TREE HE SETTLED HIMSELF BACK UPON HIS HAUNCHES TO SPRING INTO THE WAGON THEN A NEW IDEA FLASHED INTO HIS CUNNING RED HEAD
7061-88086-0008 NO ONE WHO VALUED FRESH CAUGHT TROUT AT THEIR FULL WORTH WOULD LEAVE THEM THUS UNGUARDED UNLESS FOR A SINISTER PURPOSE THEY WERE SURELY LEFT THERE AS A TRAP
7061-88086-0009 THE FOX WRINKLED HIS NOSE WITH MINGLED REGRET AND DISDAIN HE KNEW SOMETHING OF TRAPS HE HAD ONCE BEEN NIPPED HE WAS NOT TO BE CAUGHT AGAIN NOT HE
7061-88086-0010 WHAT FOOLS THESE MEN WERE AFTER ALL HIS SATISFACTION AT HAVING SEEN THROUGH THEIR SCHEMES ALMOST COMPENSATED HIM FOR THE LOSS OF THE EXPECTED MEAL HE DREW BACK SAT DOWN ON HIS TAIL
7061-88086-0011 THEN HE TROTTED AWAY INTO THE FOREST AGAIN TO HUNT WOOD MICE BUT IT WAS JUST HERE THAT THE RED PROWLER'S CUNNING OVERREACHED ITSELF
7061-88086-0012 THE BASKET IN THE WAGON WAS FULL OF TROUT AND THERE WAS NO TRAP TO BE FEARED HE MIGHT HAVE FEASTED TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT AND INCURRED NO PENALTY MORE SERIOUS THAN THE DISAPPROVAL OF THE TETHERED HORSE
7061-88086-0013 HAD HE NOT BEEN QUITE SO AMAZINGLY CLEVER FOR EVEN AMONG THE WILD KINDREDS THE PRIZE IS NOT ALWAYS TO HIM OF NIMBLE WIT THE TROUT WERE THERE IN THE BASKET SIMPLY BECAUSE THE FISHING HAD BEEN SO GOOD
7061-88086-0014 FINE VIVID FISH OF GOOD PAN SIZE WERE LYING IN THE OPEN DANCING RUNS AND ABOUT THE TAILS OF THE RAPIDS AND THEY WERE RISING FREELY TO ALMOST ANY BRIGHT FLY THOUGH WITH A PREFERENCE FOR A RED HACKLE
7061-88086-0015 TOWARD NOON THE FISHERMEN HAD RETURNED TO THE CLEARING TO LUNCH BENEATH THE BIRCH TREE AND TO FEED AND WATER THE HORSE THEY HAD EMPTIED ALL THEIR CATCH INTO ONE BASKET STOWED THE BASKET UNDER THE WAGON SEAT
7061-88086-0016 WITH ITS WIDE POOLS AND LONG SUNLIT RAPIDS BELOW THE BRIDGE GOOD FISHERMEN BUT NOT EXPERT WOODSMEN THEY HAD NO IDEA THAT HERE IN THE SOLITUDE
7061-88086-0017 STILL HALF FULL AS THE FISHERMEN HAD PROVIDED THEMSELVES FOR ANOTHER SUBSTANTIAL MEAL HE HURRIEDLY DEVOURED ABOUT HALF THE CONTENTS OF THE LUNCH BASKET TRANSFERRED THE REST TO HIS DIRTY BUNDLE
7061-88086-0018 AND WITH HUGE SATISFACTION LIGHTED A HALF BURNED CIGAR WHICH ONE OF THE FISHERMEN HAD LEFT LYING ON A LOG NEXT HE INVESTIGATED THE FISHING BASKET HALF A DOZEN OF THE FINEST FISH HE TOOK OUT
7061-88086-0019 AND STRUNG UPON A FORKED TWIG THIS HE DID NOT REGARD AS STEALING BUT MERELY AS THE EXACTION OF A SMALL AND REASONABLE TRIBUTE FROM A SOCIETY WHICH HAD OF LATE NEGLECTED TO FEED HIM ANY TOO WELL
7061-88086-0020 PUFFING HIS CIGAR BUTT IN HIGH GOOD HUMOR HE WENT OVER AND MADE FRIENDS WITH THE HORSE FEEDING IT WITH A FEW HANDFULS OF FRESH GRASS THEN WITH THE STRING OF FISH DANGLING BESIDE HIS BUNDLE
7061-88086-0021 FEELING RATHER LONELY NEIGHED AFTER HIM AS HE DISAPPEARED AN ABANDONED CLEARING OR A DESERTED LOG CABIN SOMETHING TO WHICH MAN HAS SET HIS HAND AND THEN WITHDRAWN IT
7061-88086-0022 SEEMS ALWAYS A PLACE OF PECULIAR FASCINATION TO THE CREATURES OF THE WILDERNESS THEY HAVE SOME SENSE PERHAPS OF HAVING REGAINED A LOST DOMINION OR POSSIBLY THEY THINK FROM THESE HIS LEAVINGS
7061-88086-0023 UP FROM THE FRINGING BUSHES ALONG THE STREAM'S EDGE CAME FURTIVELY A LITTLE LOW LONG BODIED BEAST IN SHAPE MUCH LIKE AN EXAGGERATED WEASEL BUT ALMOST BLACK IN COLOR
7061-88086-0024 ITS HEAD WAS ALMOST TRIANGULAR ITS EYES SET NEAR TOGETHER WERE BRIGHT AND CRUEL IT CAME HALF WAY ACROSS THE MEADOW THEN STOPPED AND EYED FOR SOME TIME THE TETHERED HORSE AND THE DESERTED WAGON
7061-88086-0025 SEEING NOTHING TO TAKE ALARM AT IT MADE A WIDE CIRCUIT RAN BEHIND THE CABIN AND REAPPEARED AS THE FOX HAD DONE AT THE CORNER NEAREST THE WAGON FROM THIS POINT OF VANTAGE IT SURVEYED THE SITUATION ANEW
7061-88086-0026 A LITTLE SPARK OF BLOOD RED FIRE ALTERNATELY GLOWING AND FADING IN ITS EYES AS ITS KEEN NOSTRILS CAUGHT THE SCENT OF THE FISH SATISFIED AT LENGTH THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER WITHIN RANGE THE MINK
7061-88086-0027 GLIDED UP TO THE WAGON THE HORSE IT PAID NO HEED TO IT CIRCLED THE WAGON A COUPLE OF TIMES IN A NERVOUS JERKY RUN ITS HEAD DARTING THIS WAY AND THAT TILL ITS NOSE ASSURED IT BEYOND QUESTION
7061-88086-0028 THE HOLE IN THE TOP OF THE BASKET THOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE SQUEEZED HIS HEAD THROUGH IT WAS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO LET HIM REACH THE FISH
7061-88086-0029 THE BACK OF THE WAGON CONSISTED OF A HINGED FLAP AND THE FISHERMEN HAD LEFT IT HANGING DOWN THE BASKET DRAGGED THIS WAY AND THAT CAME PRESENTLY TO THE EDGE TOPPLED OVER AND FELL HEAVILY TO THE GROUND ON ITS BULGING SIDE
7061-88086-0030 THE FASTENING CAME UNDONE AND THE COVER FLOPPED HALF OPEN THE MINK DROPPED DOWN BESIDE IT FLUNG HIMSELF UPON IT FURIOUSLY AND BEGAN JERKING FORTH AND SCATTERING THE CONTENTS
7061-88086-0031 TEARING MOUTHFULS OUT OF ONE FISH AFTER ANOTHER IN A PAROXYSM OF GREED AS IF HE FEARED THEY WERE STILL ALIVE AND MIGHT GET AWAY FROM HIM THE BASKET EMPTIED AND HIS FIRST RAGE GLUTTED
7061-88086-0032 THE MINK NOW FELL TO THE BUSINESS OF MAKING A SERIOUS MEAL SELECTING A FISH TO HIS TASTE HE ATE IT AT GREAT LEISURE LEAVING THE HEAD AND THE TAIL UPON THE GRASS THEN HE PICKED OUT A LARGER ONE AS IF HE REGARDED THE FIRST
7061-88086-0033 AS MERELY AN APPETIZER AS HE GNAWED LUXURIOUSLY AT THE SILVER AND BUFF VERMILION SPOTTED TIT BIT AN IMMENSE SHADOW FLOATED BETWEEN HIM AND THE SUN
7061-88086-0034 FURIOUS AT HAVING MISSED HER STRIKE THE GREAT HORNED OWL THAT TIGRESS OF THE AIR FLAPPED UP AGAIN ON HER SOUNDLESS DOWNY WINGS AND SWOOPED SUDDENLY AT THE BASKET AS IF TRYING TO TURN IT OVER
7061-88086-0035 AS HER TALONS CLAWED AT THE WICKERWORK FEELING FOR A HOLD THE HEAD OF THE MINK ON ITS LONG SNAKY NECK DARTED FORTH REACHED UP AND STRUCK ITS FINE WHITE FANGS INTO HER THIGH
7061-88086-0036 FOR ALL HIS RAGE THE MINK KEPT HIS WITS ABOUT HIM HE KNEW THE OWL FOR ONE OF HIS MOST DANGEROUS RIVALS AND ADVERSARIES HE KNEW THAT HE COULD KILL HER IF ONCE HE COULD REACH HER THROAT
7061-88086-0037 OR GET HIS GRIP FIXED ON ONE OF HER MIGHTY WINGS CLOSE TO THE BASE BUT THAT IF KEPT HIM PRUDENT HE WAS TOO WELL AWARE THAT IN AN OPEN COMBAT
7061-88086-0038 HE WAS MORE THAN LIKELY TO GET HIS NECK OR HIS BACK INTO THE CLUTCH OF THOSE INEXORABLE TALONS AND THAT WOULD BE THE END OF HIM DISCREETLY THEREFORE HE KEPT HIMSELF WELL WITHIN THE BASKET
7061-88086-0039 WHICH WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD HIM COMFORTABLY HE SNARLED SHRILLY THROUGH THE LITTLE SQUARE HOLE IN THE COVER WHILE HIS ASSAILANT BALKED OF HER PREY AND FURIOUS WITH THE SMART OF HER WOUND
7061-88086-0040 POUNCED ONCE MORE UPON THE BASKET AND STROVE TO CLAW AN ENTRANCE A CHANCE BLOW OF ONE OF HER POUNDING WINGS DROVE THE LID THE BASKET BEING STILL ON ITS SIDE COMPLETELY TO THE SORREL HORSE UNDER THE BIRCH TREE
7061-88086-0041 SWUNG ROUND ON HIS TETHER AND ROLLED HIS EYES AND SNORTED DEEPLY SCANDALIZED AT SUCH GOINGS ON ABOUT HIS FAMILIAR WAGON IT WAS JUST AT THIS POINT IN THE MINK'S ADVENTURE THAT THE FOX RETURNED TO THE CLEARING
7061-88086-0042 HE HAD HAD RATHER POOR LUCK WITH THE WOOD MICE AND HIS CHAPS WATERED WITH THE MEMORY OF THOSE TROUT IN THE WAGON SOMETHING OF AN EXPERT IN DEALING WITH TRAPS HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD TRY TO CIRCUMVENT THIS ONE
7061-88086-0043 THE SIGHT THAT MET HIS SHREWD EYES AS HE EMERGED WARILY FROM THE COVER OF THE FIR WOODS AMAZED HIM HE HALTED TO TAKE IT IN THOROUGHLY HE SAW THE BASKET LYING ON THE GROUND AND THE ANGRY OWL CLAWING AT IT
7061-88086-0044 THE FISH HE DID NOT SEE HE CONCLUDED THAT THEY WERE STILL IN THE BASKET AND THAT THE OWL WAS TRYING TO GET AT THEM THIS PARTICULAR KIND OF OWL AS HE KNEW WAS A MOST FORMIDABLE ANTAGONIST
7061-88086-0045 BUT THE EARS OF AN OWL ARE A VERY MIRACLE OF SENSITIVENESS THEY CAN CATCH THE SQUEAK OF A MOUSE AT A DISTANCE WHICH FOR ORDINARY EARS WOULD MAKE THE SHARP CLUCKING OF A CHIPMUNK INAUDIBLE
7061-88086-0046 MOON PALE EYES AND THEN SAILED OFF WITHOUT A SOUND HAVING NO MIND TO TRY CONCLUSIONS WITH THE LONG JAWED RED STRANGER THE FOX WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THE TROUT LYING SCATTERED ABOUT THE GRASS
7061-88086-0047 HE DREW BACK HASTILY AND SAT DOWN ON HIS TAIL EARS COCKED AND HEAD TILTED TO ONE SIDE TO CONSIDER IT PUZZLED HIM GREATLY THAT THERE SHOULD BE A MINK IN THE BASKET TIP TOEING CAUTIOUSLY AROUND IT
7061-88086-0048 HE SAW THAT THE LID WAS SLIGHTLY OPEN SO THAT THE MINK COULD COME OUT IF HE WISHED BUT THE FOX DID NOT WANT HIM TO COME OUT WHAT THE FOX WANTED WAS FISH NOT A FIGHT WITH AN ADVERSARY WHO WOULD GIVE HIM A LOT OF TROUBLE
7061-88086-0049 THE MINK WAS RAGING IRRESOLUTELY IT GALLED HIM TO THE MARROW TO WATCH HIS BIG ARROGANT BUSH TAILED RIVAL COMPLACENTLY GULPING DOWN THOSE FINE FAT TROUT BUT
7061-88086-0050 WELL HE HAD HIMSELF ALREADY EATEN ONE OF THE TROUT AND A GOOD PART OF ANOTHER HIS HUNGER WAS BLUNTED HE COULD RAGE WITHIN REASON AND HIS REASON ADMONISHED HIM TO KEEP OUT OF THIS FIGHT IF IT COULD BE MANAGED
7061-88086-0051 HE KNEW THE WHIPCORD MUSCLE UNDERLYING THAT SOFT RED FUR THE DEADLY GRIP OF THOSE LONG NARROW JAWS THERE IS NO PEACE COUNSELLOR LIKE A CONTENTED BELLY SO HE SNARLED SOFTLY TO HIMSELF AND WAITED
7061-88086-0052 THE FOX HAVING SWALLOWED AS MUCH AS HE COULD HOLD STOOD UP STRETCHED HIMSELF AND LICKED HIS CHAPS THE LOOK WHICH HE KEPT UPON THE BASKET WAS NO LESS VIGILANT THAN BEFORE BUT THERE WAS NOW A TINGE OF SCORN IN IT
7061-88086-0053 THERE WERE STILL SOME TROUT LEFT BUT HE WANTED TO GET AWAY HE SNATCHED UP THE TWO BIGGEST FISH IN HIS JAWS AND TROTTED OFF WITH THEM TO THE WOODS GLANCING BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER AS HE WENT
7061-88086-0054 THE MINK WOULD NOW HAVE FOUGHT BUT THE FOX HAD NO THOUGHT OF RETURNING THERE WAS NOTHING TO FIGHT ABOUT HE HAD GOT WHAT HE WANTED HE HAD NO ROOTED OBJECTION TO THE MINK HAVING WHAT WAS LEFT HE TROTTED AWAY NONCHALANTLY TOWARD HIS BURROW
7061-88086-0055 HE HAD NOT THE FOX'S WIT OR PROVIDENCE TO CARRY THEM OFF AND HIDE THEM FOR FUTURE USE HE LEFT THEM THEREFORE WITH A COLLECTION OF NEATLY SEVERED HEADS AND TAILS TO MOCK THE FISHERMEN WHEN THEY SHOULD RETURN AT SUNSET
7061-88086-0056 HE WAS FEELING VERY DROWSY AT A DELIBERATE PACE QUITE UNLIKE HIS USUAL EAGER AND DARTING MOVEMENTS HE MADE OFF DOWN THE CLEARING TOWARD THE WATER BENEATH THE BANK WAS AN OLD MUSQUASH HOLE
7061-88086-0057 WHICH HE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ONLY THE OTHER DAY INDEED HE HAD CLEARED OUT ITS INHABITANTS DEVOURING THEIR LITTER OF YOUNG HE CRAWLED INTO THE HOLE CURLED UP ON THE SOFT DEAD GRASS OF THE DEVASTATED NEST
