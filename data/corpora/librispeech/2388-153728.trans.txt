2388-153728-0000 FROM A HISTORICAL AND PICTURESQUE POINT OF VIEW
2388-153728-0001 IS THEIR EFFECT UPON THE FORMS OF THE CONSTELLATIONS
2388-153728-0002 THE CONSTELLATIONS ARE FORMED BY CHANCE COMBINATIONS OF CONSPICUOUS STARS LIKE FIGURES IN A KALEIDOSCOPE
2388-153728-0003 OF COSMIC EXISTENCE WE SHOULD PERCEIVE THAT THE KALEIDOSCOPE OF THE HEAVENS WAS CEASELESSLY TURNING AND THROWING THE STARS
2388-153728-0004 EVEN IF THE STARS STOOD FAST THE MOTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM WOULD GRADUALLY ALTER THE CONFIGURATIONS AS THE ELEMENTS OF A LANDSCAPE DISSOLVE AND RECOMBINE IN FRESH GROUPINGS WITH THE TRAVELER'S PROGRESS AMID THEM BUT WITH THE STARS THEMSELVES
2388-153728-0005 ONLY THE DELIBERATION OF GEOLOGICAL MOVEMENTS CAN BE CONTRASTED WITH THE EVOLUTION AND DEVOLUTION OF THE CONSTELLATIONS AND YET THIS SECULAR FLUCTUATION OF THE CONSTELLATION FIGURES IS NOT WITHOUT KEEN INTEREST FOR THE MEDITATIVE OBSERVER
2388-153728-0006 TO THE PASSING GLANCE WHICH IS ALL THAT WE CAN BESTOW UPON THESE FIGURES THEY APPEAR SO IMMUTABLE
2388-153728-0007 IN THE FORMS OF THE CONSTELLATIONS
2388-153728-0008 YET IN A BROAD SENSE THIS SCROLL OF HUMAN THOUGHT IMPRINTED ON THE HEAVENS
2388-153728-0009 ALTHOUGH MORE ENDURING THAN PARCHMENT TOMBS PYRAMIDS AND TEMPLES
2388-153728-0010 OF WHAT MAN HAS FANCIED AND DONE BEFORE STUDYING THE EFFECTS THAT THE MOTIONS OF THE STARS HAVE HAD AND WILL HAVE UPON THE CONSTELLATIONS
2388-153728-0011 TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE EFFECTS IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO RECALL THAT THE CONSTELLATIONS REGISTER THE OLDEST TRADITIONS OF OUR RACE IN THE HISTORY OF PRIMEVAL RELIGIONS
2388-153728-0012 BASED ON SOMETHING OLDER YET WE MAY REFER FOR ILLUSTRATION TO THAT OF THE MYSTERIOUS MAYA RACE OF AMERICA AT IZAMAL IN YUCATAN SAYS MISTER STANSBURY HAGAR IS A GROUP OF RUINS PERCHED AFTER THE MEXICAN AND CENTRAL AMERICAN PLAN
2388-153728-0013 THE FIGURES AND THE NAMES OF COURSE WERE NOT THE SAME AS THOSE THAT WE HAVE DERIVED FROM OUR ARYAN ANCESTORS BUT THE STAR GROUPS WERE THE SAME OR NEARLY SO FOR INSTANCE THE LOFTIEST OF THE TEMPLES AT IZAMAL
2388-153728-0014 WAS CONNECTED WITH THE SIGN OF THE CONSTELLATION KNOWN TO US AS CANCER
2388-153728-0015 AND CONSUME THE OFFERINGS LEFT UPON THE ALTAR OUR SCORPIO WAS KNOWN TO THE MAYAS AS A SIGN OF THE DEATH GOD OUR LIBRA THE BALANCE
2388-153728-0016 SEEMS TO BE IDENTICAL WITH THE MAYAN CONSTELLATION
2388-153728-0017 WITH WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED A TEMPLE WHERE DWELT THE PRIESTS WHOSE SPECIAL BUSINESS IT WAS TO ADMINISTER JUSTICE AND TO FORETELL THE FUTURE BY MEANS OF INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD ORION THE HUNTER OF OUR CELESTIAL MYTHOLOGY
2388-153728-0018 WAS AMONG THE MAYAS A WARRIOR WHILE SAGITTARIUS AND OTHERS OF OUR CONSTELLATIONS WERE KNOWN TO THEM UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES OF COURSE AND ALL WERE ENDOWED WITH A RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM AND THE SAME STAR FIGURES HAVING THE SAME SIGNIFICANCE WERE FAMILIAR TO THE PERUVIANS
2388-153728-0019 BUT IN FACT
2388-153728-0020 EMPLOYED THEM IN SOME SYMBOLIC OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY AS HANDLED BY THE GREEKS FROM PREHISTORIC TIMES THE CONSTELLATION MYTHS BECAME THE VERY SOUL OF POETRY THE IMAGINATION OF THAT WONDERFUL RACE IDEALIZED THE PRINCIPAL STAR GROUPS
2388-153728-0021 SO EFFECTIVELY THAT THE FIGURES AND TRADITIONS THUS ATTACHED TO THEM HAVE FOR CIVILIZED MANKIND DISPLACED ALL OTHERS JUST AS GREEK ART IN ITS HIGHEST FORMS STANDS WITHOUT PARALLEL AND ECLIPSES EVERY RIVAL
2388-153728-0022 THE ROMANS TRANSLATED NO HEROES AND HEROINES OF THE MYTHICAL PERIOD OF THEIR HISTORY TO THE SKY
2388-153728-0023 ZEUS IN THE FORM OF THE WHITE BULL TAURUS BEARS THE FAIR EUROPA ON HIS BACK THROUGH THE CELESTIAL WAVES ANDROMEDA STRETCHES FORTH HER SHACKLED ARMS IN THE STAR GEMMED ETHER BESEECHING AID
2388-153728-0024 PROFESSOR YOUNG HAS SIGNIFICANTLY REMARKED THAT A GREAT NUMBER OF THE CONSTELLATIONS ARE CONNECTED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER
2388-153728-0025 THAT STRANGELY FASCINATING LEGEND OF EARLIEST GREEK STORY WHICH HAS NEVER LOST ITS CHARM FOR MANKIND IN VIEW OF ALL THIS WE MAY WELL CONGRATULATE OURSELVES THAT THE CONSTELLATIONS WILL OUTLAST OUR TIME AND THE TIME OF COUNTLESS GENERATIONS TO FOLLOW US
2388-153728-0026 AND YET THEY ARE VERY FAR FROM BEING ETERNAL LET US NOW STUDY SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF THE STELLAR MOTIONS UPON THEM WE BEGIN WITH THE FAMILIAR FIGURE OF THE GREAT DIPPER HE WHO HAS NOT DRUNK INSPIRATION FROM ITS CELESTIAL BOWL
2388-153728-0027 THIS FIGURE IS MADE UP OF SEVEN CONSPICUOUS STARS IN THE CONSTELLATION URSA MAJOR THE GREATER BEAR THE HANDLE OF THE DIPPER
2388-153728-0028 OF THE SEVEN STARS MENTIONED SIX ARE OF NEARLY EQUAL BRIGHTNESS RANKING AS OF THE SECOND MAGNITUDE WHILE THE SEVENTH IS OF ONLY THE THIRD MAGNITUDE
2388-153728-0029 THERE APPEARS TO BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE FAINT STAR WHICH IS SITUATED AT THE JUNCTION OF THE BOWL AND THE HANDLE IS A VARIABLE OF LONG PERIOD SINCE THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
2388-153728-0030 BOTH THE NAMES AND THE GREEK LETTERS WHICH ARE ATTACHED TO THE SEVEN STARS BEGINNING AT THE STAR IN THE UPPER OUTER EDGE OF THE RIM OF THE BOWL AND RUNNING IN REGULAR ORDER ROUND THE BOTTOM AND THEN OUT TO THE END OF THE HANDLE
2388-153728-0031 IS THE FAINT STAR ALREADY MENTIONED AT THE JUNCTION OF THE BOWL AND HANDLE AND MIZAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HANDLE HAS A CLOSE NAKED EYE COMPANION WHICH IS NAMED ALCOR
2388-153728-0032 ARE CALLED THE POINTERS BECAUSE AN IMAGINARY LINE DRAWN NORTHWARD THROUGH THEM INDICATES THE POLE STAR
2388-153728-0033 WITH ITS COMRADE ARE MOVING WITH PRACTICALLY THE SAME SPEED IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION WHILE THE OTHER TWO
2388-153728-0034 BENETNASCH ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY MOVING WESTWARD THE MOTIONS OF BENETNASCH BEING APPARENTLY MORE RAPID THE CONSEQUENCE OF THESE OPPOSED MOTIONS IS OF COURSE THAT THE FIGURE OF THE DIPPER CANNOT ALWAYS HAVE EXISTED
2388-153728-0035 AND WILL NOT CONTINUE TO EXIST IN THE ACCOMPANYING DIAGRAMS IT HAS BEEN THOUGHT INTERESTING TO SHOW THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THESE SEVEN STARS AS SEEN FROM THE POINT WHICH THE EARTH NOW OCCUPIES BOTH IN THE PAST AND IN THE FUTURE
2388-153728-0036 THE TIME NO DOUBT SEEMS LONG BUT REMEMBER THE VAST STRETCH OF AGES THROUGH WHICH THE EARTH HAS PASSED AND THEN REFLECT THAT NO REASON IS APPARENT WHY OUR GLOBE SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO BE A SCENE OF ANIMATION FOR TEN THOUSAND CENTURIES YET TO COME
2388-153728-0037 THE FACT THAT THE LITTLE STAR ALCOR PLACED SO CLOSE TO MIZAR SHOULD ACCOMPANY THE LATTER IN ITS FLIGHT IS NOT SURPRISING
2388-153728-0038 IS SURPRISING IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE AND IT RECALLS THE STRANGE THEORY OF A DOUBLE DRIFT AFFECTING ALL THE STARS TO WHICH ATTENTION WAS CALLED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER
2388-153728-0039 FROM THE GREAT DIPPER WE TURN TO A CONSTELLATION HARDLY LESS CONSPICUOUS AND SITUATED AT AN EQUAL DISTANCE FROM THE POLE ON THE OTHER SIDE CASSIOPEIA
2388-153728-0040 WAS PUNISHED BY THE EXPOSURE OF HER DAUGHTER ANDROMEDA TO THE SEA MONSTER IS WELL MARKED BY FIVE STARS WHICH FORM AN IRREGULAR LETTER W WITH ITS OPEN SIDE TOWARD THE POLE
2388-153728-0041 FOUR OF THEM BETA ALPHA DELTA AND EPSILON ARE TRAVELING EASTWARDLY AT VARIOUS SPEEDS WHILE THE FIFTH GAMMA MOVES IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION
2388-153728-0042 AND DIFFERENT OBSERVERS OFTEN VARY CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR RESULTS IN THE BEAUTIFUL NORTHERN CROWN
2388-153728-0043 THE ALTERNATE COMBINING AND SCATTERING EFFECTS OF THE STELLAR MOTIONS ARE SHOWN BY COMPARING THE APPEARANCE
2388-153728-0044 WITH THAT WHICH IT HAS AT PRESENT AND THAT WHICH IT WILL HAVE IN THE FUTURE THE SEVEN PRINCIPLE STARS OF THE ASTERISM FORMING A SURPRISINGLY PERFECT CORONET HAVE MOVEMENTS IN THREE DIRECTIONS AT RIGHT ANGLES TO ONE ANOTHER
2388-153728-0045 JOB'S COFFIN DELPHINUS THE GREAT SQUARE OF PEGASUS THE TWINS GEMINI THE BEAUTIFUL SICKLE IN LEO AND THE EXQUISITE GROUP OF THE HYADES IN TAURUS
2388-153728-0046 ALDEBARAN ONE OF THE FINEST OF ALL STARS BOTH FOR ITS BRILLIANCE AND ITS COLOR IS THE MOST AFFECTED BY THE EASTERLY MOTION IN TIME IT WILL DRIFT ENTIRELY OUT OF CONNECTION WITH ITS PRESENT NEIGHBORS
2388-153728-0047 NOT BECAUSE ITS STARS ARE PHYSICALLY CONNECTED BUT BECAUSE OF THEIR GREAT DISTANCE WHICH RENDERS THEIR MOVEMENTS TOO DELIBERATE TO BE EXACTLY ASCERTAINED TWO OF THE GREATEST OF ITS STARS
2388-153728-0048 POSSESS AS FAR AS HAS BEEN ASCERTAINED NO PERCEPTIBLE MOTION ACROSS THE LINE OF SIGHT
2388-153728-0049 AT THE PRESENT TIME THIS CONSISTS OF AN ALMOST PERFECT STRAIGHT LINE A ROW OF SECOND MAGNITUDE STARS ABOUT EQUALLY SPACED
2388-153728-0050 IN THE COURSE OF TIME HOWEVER THE TWO RIGHT HAND STARS MINTAKA AND ALNILAM
2388-153728-0051 WILL APPROACH EACH OTHER AND FORM A NAKED EYE DOUBLE
2388-153728-0052 ALNITA WILL DRIFT AWAY EASTWARD SO THAT THE BELT WILL NO LONGER EXIST FOR ONE MORE EXAMPLE LET US GO TO THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE WHOSE MOST CELEBRATED CONSTELLATION THE SOUTHERN CROSS HAS FOUND A PLACE IN ALL MODERN LITERATURES
2388-153728-0053 ALTHOUGH IT HAS NO CLAIM TO CONSIDERATION ON ACCOUNT OF ASSOCIATION WITH ANCIENT LEGENDS THIS MOST ATTRACTIVE ASTERISM WHICH HAS NEVER CEASED TO FASCINATE THE IMAGINATION OF CHRISTENDOM SINCE IT WAS FIRST DEVOUTLY DESCRIBED BY THE EARLY EXPLORERS OF THE SOUTH
2388-153728-0054 IS BUT A PASSING COLLOCATION OF BRILLIANT STARS YET EVEN IN ITS TRANSFIGURATIONS IT HAS BEEN FOR HUNDREDS OF CENTURIES AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE FOR HUNDREDS OF CENTURIES TO COME A MOST STRIKING OBJECT IN THE SKY
2388-153728-0055 OUR FIGURES SHOW ITS APPEARANCE IN THREE SUCCESSIVE PHASES FIRST AS IT WAS FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO VIEWED FROM THE EARTH'S PRESENT LOCATION SECOND AS IT IS IN OUR DAY
2388-153728-0056 THE NEARNESS OF THESE BRIGHT STARS TO ONE ANOTHER THE LENGTH OF THE LONGER BEAM OF THE CROSS IS ONLY SIX DEGREES MAKES THIS GROUP VERY NOTICEABLE WHATEVER THE ARRANGEMENT OF ITS COMPONENTS MAY BE THE LARGEST STAR AT THE BASE OF THE CROSS
2388-153728-0057 BUT SINCE THE MOTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM ITSELF WILL IN THE COURSE OF SO LONG A PERIOD AS FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS PRODUCE A GREAT CHANGE IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE HEAVENS AS SEEN FROM THE EARTH BY CARRYING US NEARLY NINETEEN TRILLION MILES FROM OUR PRESENT PLACE
2388-153728-0058 WHY IT MAY BE ASKED SEEK TO REPRESENT FUTURE APPEARANCES OF THE CONSTELLATIONS WHICH WE COULD NOT HOPE TO SEE EVEN IF WE COULD SURVIVE SO LONG THE ANSWER IS
2388-153728-0059 THE CONSTELLATIONS ARE MORE OR LESS FAMILIAR TO EVERYBODY
2388-153728-0060 MUST AT ONCE STRIKE THE EYE AND THE IMAGINATION AND MAKE CLEARER THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE STARS
2388-153728-0061 AND IF OUR RACE IS DESTINED TO SURVIVE YET A MILLION YEARS THEN OUR REMOTE DESCENDENTS WILL SEE A NEW HEAVENS
2388-153728-0062 IF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIVE DISTANCES OF THE STARS WERE MORE COMPLETE IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING EXERCISE IN CELESTIAL GEOMETRY TO PROJECT THE CONSTELLATIONS PROBABLY VISIBLE
2388-153728-0063 EXCEPT PERHAPS IN A FEW CASES AS SEEN FOR INSTANCE FROM THE NEAREST KNOWN STAR ALPHA CENTAURI
2388-153728-0064 COULD ONLY RANK AS A FIFTH OR SIXTH MAGNITUDE STAR
