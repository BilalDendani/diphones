5831-87174-0000 THE WAGON HAD COME TO REST AMONG THE TREES AN HOUR OR TWO BEFORE SUNSET IT WAS A COVERED IN DRAY AND HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO IN A LITTLE CLEARING OF THE SCRUBBY UNDERGROWTH TWO HORSES HAD DRAWN IT ALL THE WAY FROM THE COAST
5831-87174-0001 FREED OF THEIR HARNESS THEY STOOD IN THE LEE OF A GREAT GUM THEIR FLANKS MATTED WITH THE DUST WHICH HAD CAKED WITH THE RUN OF SWEAT ON THEM
5831-87174-0002 A RED DAPPLED COW AND HER CALF WERE TETHERED TO A WHEEL OF THE WAGON AND AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THEM WERE TWO BATTERED CRATES OF DROOPING AND DROWSY FOWLS
5831-87174-0003 ON A PATCH OF EARTH SCRAPED CLEAR OF GRASS AND LEAVES THE FIRE THREW OFF WISPS OF SMOKE AND THE DRY MUSKY INCENSE OF BURNING EUCALYPTUS AND DOGWOOD IT HAD SMOULDERED
5831-87174-0004 AND A WOMAN STOOPING BESIDE IT WAS FEEDING IT WITH BRANCHES OF BRUSHWOOD AND STICKS THAT SHE BROKE IN HER HANDS OR ACROSS HER KNEES A MAN WAS BUSY IN THE INTERIOR OF THE WAGON MOVING HEAVY CASKS AND PIECES OF FURNITURE HE LIFTED THEM OUT
5831-87174-0005 PILED THEM ON THE GROUND AND SPREAD A COUPLE OF SHEEPSKINS OVER THEM THEN HE THREW A SHEEPSKIN AND A BLANKET OF BLACK AND BROWN TWEED ON THE FLOOR FOR THE NIGHT'S RESTING IT HAD BEEN CLIMBING THE FOOTHILLS FOR DAYS THIS HEAVY OLD FASHIONED VEHICLE
5831-87174-0006 AND THE MAN AND THE WOMAN HAD CLIMBED WITH IT SHE DRIVING THE COW AND CALF HE GIVING HIS ATTENTION TO THE HORSES AND CLEARING THE TRACK SO SLOWLY HAD IT TOILED ALONG THAT AT A LITTLE DISTANCE IT LOOKED LIKE SOME WEARY INDEFATIGABLE INSECT CREEPING AMONG THE TREES
5831-87174-0007 THE HORSES A STURDY YOUNG SANDY GREY MARE AND A RAW WEEDY WEATHER WORN BAY SEEMED AS MUCH PART OF IT AS ITS WOODEN FRAME IRONSHOD WHEELS AND AWNING OF GRIMY SAILCLOTH
5831-87174-0008 THEY TUGGED AT THEIR LOAD WITH DULL DUMB PATIENCE AND OBSTINACY ALTHOUGH THE BAY HAD STUMBLED RATHER BADLY THE WHOLE WAY THE MAN HAD PUT HIS SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL HELPING THE HORSES UP THE STEEP BANKS AND LONG SLIPPERY SIDINGS
5831-87174-0009 HE HAD STOOD TREMBLING AND SWEATING WITH THEM WHEN HEAVY PLACES IN THE ROAD WERE PAST THE VEINS KNOTTED IN HIS SWARTHY FOREHEAD THE BARE COLUMN OF HIS THROAT GASPING FOR THE MOUNTAIN AIR THERE WAS THE SAME TOILING FACULTY IN HIM THAT THERE WAS IN THE HORSES
5831-87174-0010 AN INSTINCT TO OVERCOME ALL DIFFICULTIES BY EXERTION OF THE MUSCLES OF HIS BACK THE WAGON HAD CREAKED GARRULOUSLY ON THE LONG SLOPES AND STUTTERED AND GROANED UP THE STEEP HILL SIDES
5831-87174-0011 IT HAD FORDED CREEKS THE HORSES SPLASHING SOBERLY THROUGH THEM AND SENDING THE SPRAY INTO THE AIR ON EITHER SIDE IT HAD CRASHED OVER THE UNDERGROWTH THAT ENCROACHED ON THE TRACK AN ILL BLAZED STOCK ROUTE AMONG THE TREES
5831-87174-0012 AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THE MAN HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO HAUL ASIDE FALLEN TIMBER OR BURN IT WHERE IT LAY AND CUT AWAY SAPLINGS IN ORDER TO MAKE A NEW PATH THE WAGON WAS FILLED WITH BOXES AND BAGS OF FOOD STUFFS AND PIECES OF FURNITURE
5831-87174-0013 INSIDE IT SMELT LIKE A GROCER'S SHOP AND IT HAD TRAILED THE MINGLED ODOUR OF MEAL CORNED MEAT HEMP IRON SEED WHEAT CRUDE OIL AND POTATOES THROUGH THE VIRGIN PURITY OF THE FOREST AIR
5831-87174-0014 BENEATH ITS FLOOR IN WRAPPINGS OF TORN BAGS STRAW AND HESSIAN WERE LASHED A WOODEN PLOUGH A BROAD BLADED SHOVEL AND HALF A DOZEN FARMING AND CARPENTERING TOOLS THE FOWLS A GAME ROOSTER A BUFF HEN AND A SPECKLED PULLET
5831-87174-0015 HUNG IN WICKER BASKETS FROM WOODEN PEGS AT THE BACK THEY AND THE COW AND HER CALF HAD WAKENED STRANGE ECHOES IN THE FOREST THE ROOSTER HERALDING EVERY MORNING AT DAWN THIS ADVANCE GUARD OF CIVILISATION
5831-87174-0016 WHEN THE VEHICLE HAD REACHED THE SUMMIT OF THE FOOTHILLS THE TRACK FELL WAVERING INTO THE GREEN DEPTHS OF THE FOREST BEHIND IT A WALE OF BROKEN FERNS SLAIN SAPLINGS BLUE GUMS AND MYRTLES MOWN DOWN AS WITH A SCYTHE BY ITS WHEELS
5831-87174-0017 THE TIMBERED HILLS FELL AWAY WAVE UPON WAVE INTO THE MISTS OF THE DISTANCE AND THE PLAINS STRETCHED OUTWARD FROM THEM TO THE FAINTLY GLITTERING LINE THE SEA MADE ON THE DIM HORIZON SOMEWHERE TO THE WEST ON THOSE GREY PLAINS AGAINST THE SHORE OF AN INLET
5831-87174-0018 WAS THE TOWNSHIP OF PORT SOUTHERN FROM WHICH THEY HAD COME DONALD CAMERON AFTER STUDYING A ROUGHLY MADE PLAN AND THE WALL OF THE FOREST ABOUT HIM HAD TAKEN THE MARE BY HER SANDY FORELOCK AND TURNED THE WAGON IN AMONG THE TREES ON THE FAR SIDE OF A GIANT GUM
5831-87174-0019 IT RAN AT THE FOOT OF THE LONG LOW HILLSIDE AND COULD BE HEARD CROONING AND GURGLING UNDER THE LEAFY MURMUR OF THE FOREST LEAVING THE FIRE THE WOMAN WENT TO A FALLEN TRUNK SAT DOWN AND GAZED INTO THE SHADOWS GATHERING AMONG THE TREES
5831-87174-0020 A ROSY AND SAFFRON MIST HUNG BETWEEN THEIR THRONGING BOLES THE PEACE OF THE AFTER GLOW HELD THE HILLS THE CHIRRING OF INSECTS AND THE SHRILL SWEET CALLING OF BIRDS HAD QUIVERED INTO SILENCE ONLY A LEAFY WHISPERING STIRRED THE QUIET
5831-87174-0021 FOR A MOMENT THE FIRE OF HER CLEAR SPIRIT BURNT LOW HOPE AND COURAGE WERE LOST IN DREAMS THERE WAS WISTFULNESS IN HER GREY EYES AS THEY WENT OUT BEFORE HER WISTFULNESS AND HEARTACHE
5831-87174-0022 SHE SEEMED TO BE READING THE SCROLL OF THE FUTURE SEEING A DIM MYSTERIOUS UNROLLING OF JOYS AND SORROWS WITH THE EYES OF HER INNER VISION THE SUN HAD SET WHEN CAMERON RETURNED HE TETHERED THE COW TO THE WHEEL OF THE WAGON
5831-87174-0023 AND CLAMPED RUSTY HOBBLES ABOUT THE HORSES FETLOCKS THEN HE LOOKED TOWARDS THE WOMAN MARY HE CALLED SHE DID NOT HEAR AND HE WALKED TOWARDS HER A MAN OF FEW WORDS CAMERON DID NOT SPEAK AS HE SEARCHED HIS WIFE'S FACE
5831-87174-0024 I I WAS DREAMING SHE SAID LOOKING UP STARTLED AT THE SIGHT OF HIM YOU'RE NOT GRIEVING HE ASKED THERE WAS A TREMOR IN HIS VOICE THOUGH ITS ROUGHNESS ALMOST COVERED THAT NO
5831-87174-0025 NOT GRIEVING SHE SAID BUT THINKING WHAT IT WILL BE TO US AND OUR CHILDREN BY AND BY IN THIS PLACE IT IS A NEW COUNTRY AND A NEW PEOPLE WE'RE MAKING THEY SAID AT HOME AND I'M REALISING WHAT THEY MEANT NOW AYE BUT IT'S A FINE COUNTRY
5831-87174-0026 CAMERON'S EYES TRAVELLED THE LENGTH OF THE CLEARING OVER THE SLOPE OF THE HILL THEY TOOK IN THE SILENT WORLD OF THE TREES THE ROSY MIST THAT STILL GLOWED BETWEEN THEIR SLENDER THRONGING STEMS THERE WAS PRIDE AND AN EXPRESSION OF SATED HUNGER IN HIS GLANCE
5831-87174-0027 IT'S ALL OURS THIS LAND ABOUT HERE HE SAID YES HER EYES WANDERED TOO I HAVE WORKED ALL MY DAYS TILL NOW HE SAID
5831-87174-0028 REVIVING A BITTER MEMORY WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A PLOT OF SOUR EARTH AS BIG AS Y'RE HANDKERCHIEF TO CALL MY OWN WORKED FOR OTHER MEN SWEATED THE BODY AND SOUL OUT OF ME AND NOW THIS IS MINE ALL THIS HUNDRED ACRES AND MORE WHEN I'M READY FOR IT
5831-87174-0029 MORE AND MORE AND MORE HE PAUSED A MOMENT ALL THE EMOTION IN HIM STIRRED AND SURGING THEN WITH A SHORT DRAWN BREATH THAT DISMISSED THE PAST AND DEDICATED THOUGHT AND ENERGY TO THE FUTURE HE WENT ON
5831-87174-0030 I MARKED THIS PLACE WHEN I CAME THROUGH TO THE PORT WITH MIDDLETON'S CATTLE LAST YEAR I'LL RUN CATTLE BUT I WANT TO CLEAR AND CULTIVATE TOO UP THERE WHERE THERE ARE TREES NOW WILL BE PLOUGHED FIELDS AND AN ORCHARD SOON

5831-87174-0032 BUT IT IS A STRANGE LONELY LAND INDEED WITHOUT THE SIGHT OF A ROOF IN ALL THE LONG MILES WE HAVE COME BY NEVER THE SOUND OF A HUMAN VOICE OR THE LOWING OF CATTLE DONALD CAMERON DID NOT REPLY
5831-87174-0033 HE WAS ENVISAGING HIS SCHEMES FOR THE FUTURE NOT A MAN GIVEN TO DREAMS THE THOUGHTFUL MOOD HAD TAKEN HIM HIS BREATH CAME AND WENT IN STEADY DRAUGHTS
5831-87174-0034 THERE WAS DETERMINATION IN EVERY LINE OF IT A GLOOMY FACE IT WAS ROUGH CAST WITH DEEP SET EYES HIS WIFE'S WORDS AND THE SIGH THAT WENT WITH THEM WERE REPEATED IN A REMOTE BRAIN CELL
5831-87174-0035 YOU SHOULD BE GIVING THANKS NOT COMPLAINING HE SAID HIS GAZE RETURNING TO HER WE MUST DO THAT NOW GIVE THANKS FOR THE JOURNEY ACCOMPLISHED AND AS IF IT WERE THE LAST DUTY OF A WELL SPENT DAY
5831-87174-0036 HE KNELT ON THE GRASSY EARTH AND MARY KNELT BESIDE HIM DONALD CAMERON ADDRESSED HIS GOD AS MAN SPEAKS TO MAN YET HIS VOICE HAD A VIBRATING NOTE AS HE PRAYED O LORD HE SAID
