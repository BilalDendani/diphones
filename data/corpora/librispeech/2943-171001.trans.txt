2943-171001-0005 SUCH EARNEST ENTREATY THAT SAYING AH WELL I SUPPOSE THERE IS NO REAL DANGER AND SINCE YOU SEEM SO ANXIOUS TO GO I WILL NOT COMPEL YOU TO STAY AT HOME HE LIFTED HER INTO THE CARRIAGE AND SEATING HIMSELF BESIDE HER ORDERED THE COACHMAN TO DRIVE ON AS CAREFULLY AS HE COULD
2943-171001-0006 ELSIE CHANGE SEATS WITH ME
2943-171001-0007 NO REPLIED MISTER DINSMORE LAYING HIS HAND ON HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER'S SHOULDER ELSIE'S PLACE IS BY ME AND SHE SHALL SIT NOWHERE ELSE
2943-171001-0008 DO YOU THINK WE ARE IN ANY DANGER OF BEING RUN AWAY WITH ASKED ADELAIDE A LITTLE ANXIOUSLY AS SHE OBSERVED HIM GLANCING ONCE OR TWICE OUT OF THE WINDOW
2943-171001-0009 THE HORSES ARE YOUNG AND FIERY BUT AJAX IS AN EXCELLENT DRIVER HE REPLIED EVASIVELY ADDING YOU MAY BE SURE THAT IF I HAD THOUGHT THE DANGER VERY GREAT I WOULD HAVE LEFT ELSIE AT HOME THEY REACHED THE CHURCH WITHOUT ACCIDENT
2943-171001-0010 BUT ON THEIR RETURN THE HORSES TOOK FRIGHT WHILE GOING DOWN A HILL AND RUSHED ALONG AT A FURIOUS RATE WHICH THREATENED EVERY INSTANT TO UPSET THE CARRIAGE ELSIE THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING VERY FAST BUT DID NOT KNOW THAT THERE WAS REAL DANGER
2943-171001-0011 UNTIL HER FATHER SUDDENLY LIFTED HER FROM HER SEAT AND PLACING HER BETWEEN HIS KNEES HELD HER TIGHTLY AS THOUGH HE FEARED SHE WOULD BE SNATCHED FROM HIS GRASP ELSIE LOOKED UP INTO HIS FACE

2943-171001-0013 WHEN DEATH SEEMED JUST AT HAND THOSE WORDS AND THE AFFECTIONATE CLASP OF HER FATHER'S ARM SENT A THRILL OF INTENSE JOY TO THE LOVE FAMISHED HEART OF THE LITTLE GIRL BUT DESTRUCTION SEEMED INEVITABLE LORA WAS LEANING BACK HALF FAINTING WITH TERROR
2943-171001-0014 ADELAIDE SCARCELY LESS ALARMED WHILE ENNA CLUNG TO HER SOBBING MOST BITTERLY ELSIE ALONE PRESERVED A CHEERFUL SERENITY SHE HAD BUILT HER HOUSE UPON THE ROCK AND KNEW THAT IT WOULD STAND HER DESTINY WAS IN HER HEAVENLY FATHER'S HANDS
2943-171001-0015 AND SHE WAS CONTENT TO LEAVE IT THERE EVEN DEATH HAD NO TERRORS
2943-171001-0016 WHO HAD PUT HER TRUST IN JESUS BUT THEY WERE NOT TO PERISH THUS FOR AT THAT MOMENT A POWERFUL NEGRO
2943-171001-0017 THE SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED CHECK THROWING THEM UPON THEIR HAUNCHES AND BRINGING THE CARRIAGE TO AN INSTANT STAND STILL THANK GOD WE ARE SAVED THAT FELLOW SHALL BE WELL REWARDED FOR HIS BRAVE DEED EXCLAIMED MISTER DINSMORE THROWING OPEN THE CARRIAGE DOOR
2943-171001-0018 THEN LEAPING TO THE GROUND HE LIFTED ELSIE OUT SET HER DOWN AND GAVE HIS HAND TO HIS SISTERS ONE AFTER THE OTHER THEY WERE ALMOST AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE AVENUE AND ALL PREFERRED TO WALK THE SHORT DISTANCE TO THE HOUSE RATHER THAN AGAIN TRUST THEMSELVES TO THE HORSES
2943-171001-0019 MISTER DINSMORE LINGERED A MOMENT TO SPEAK TO THE MAN WHO HAD DONE THEM SUCH GOOD SERVICE AND TO GIVE SOME DIRECTIONS TO THE COACHMAN AND THEN TAKING THE HAND OF HIS LITTLE GIRL WHO HAD BEEN WAITING FOR HIM HE WALKED SLOWLY ON
2943-171001-0020 ASKING VERY KINDLY IF SHE HAD RECOVERED FROM HER FRIGHT YES PAPA SHE ANSWERED IN A QUIET TONE I KNEW THAT GOD WOULD TAKE CARE OF US OH WASN'T HE GOOD TO KEEP US ALL FROM BEING KILLED YES HE SAID VERY GRAVELY
2943-171001-0021 GO NOW AND LET MAMMY GET YOU READY FOR DINNER AS ELSIE WAS SITTING ALONE IN HER ROOM THAT AFTERNOON
2943-171001-0022 WHAT IF WE HAD BEEN KILLED WHERE WOULD WE ALL BE NOW WHERE WOULD I HAVE BEEN I BELIEVE YOU WOULD HAVE GONE STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN ELSIE BUT
2943-171001-0023 I WAS THINKING SAID ELSIE GENTLY TURNING OVER THE LEAVES OF HER LITTLE BIBLE AS SHE SPOKE OF THIS SWEET VERSE YEA THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH I WILL FEAR NO EVIL FOR THOU ART WITH ME
2943-171001-0024 SO THAT I ONLY HAD TIME TO THINK OF PAPA AND MYSELF AND I HAVE PRAYED SO MUCH FOR HIM
2943-171001-0025 DON'T LOOK SO AS IF YOU HAD DONE SOMETHING VERY WICKED ELSIE
2943-171001-0026 BUT OH ELSIE IF YOU CAN ONLY TELL ME HOW TO BE A CHRISTIAN I MEAN NOW TO TRY VERY HARD INDEED I AM DETERMINED NEVER TO REST UNTIL I AM ONE OH LORA HOW GLAD I AM CRIED ELSIE JOYFULLY
2943-171001-0027 FOR I KNOW THAT IF YOU ARE REALLY IN EARNEST YOU WILL SUCCEED
2943-171001-0028 THAT IS WHAT MEANS AM I TO USE TO GET RID OF MY SINS AND GET A NEW HEART HOW MAKE MYSELF PLEASING IN THE SIGHT OF GOD WHAT MUST I DO TO BE SAVED
2943-171001-0029 AND HE ANSWERED BELIEVE ON THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND THOU SHALT BE SAVED
2943-171001-0030 AND IN ANSWER TO YOUR OTHER QUESTION HOW SHALL I GET RID OF MY SINS SEE HERE IN THAT DAY THERE SHALL BE A FOUNTAIN OPENED TO THE HOUSE OF DAVID AND TO THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM FOR SIN AND FOR UNCLEANLINESS THAT IS IN ZECHARIAH
2943-171001-0031 THEN JOHN TELLS US WHAT THAT FOUNTAIN IS WHEN HE SAYS THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST HIS SON CLEANSETH US FROM ALL SIN AND AGAIN UNTO HIM THAT LOVED US AND WASHED US FROM OUR SINS IN HIS OWN BLOOD
2943-171001-0032 AND NOW WE HAVE NOTHING AT ALL TO DO BUT GO TO HIM AND BE WASHED IN THAT FOUNTAIN BELIEVE HIM WHEN HE SAYS I GIVE UNTO THEM ETERNAL LIFE JUST ACCEPT THE GIFT AND TRUST AND LOVE HIM THAT IS THE WHOLE OF IT
2943-171001-0033 AND IT IS SO SIMPLE THAT EVEN SUCH A LITTLE GIRL AS I CAN UNDERSTAND IT BUT SURELY ELSIE I CAN I MUST DO SOMETHING YES GOD TELLS US TO REPENT AND HE SAYS GIVE ME THINE HEART YOU CAN DO THAT
2943-171001-0034 YOU CAN LOVE JESUS AT LEAST HE WILL ENABLE YOU TO IF YOU ASK HIM AND HE WILL TEACH YOU TO BE SORRY FOR YOUR SINS THE BIBLE SAYS HE IS EXALTED TO GIVE REPENTANCE AND REMISSION OF SINS AND IF YOU ASK HIM HE WILL GIVE THEM TO YOU
2943-171001-0035 IT IS TRUE WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING GOOD OF OURSELVES WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WE CAN DO NOTHING RIGHT BECAUSE WE ARE SO VERY WICKED BUT THEN WE CAN ALWAYS GET THAT HELP IF WE ASK FOR IT JESUS SAID
2943-171001-0036 YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER IS MORE WILLING TO GIVE HIS HOLY SPIRIT TO THEM THAT ASK HIM THAN PARENTS ARE TO GIVE GOOD GIFTS UNTO THEIR CHILDREN OH LORA DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR IT DON'T BE AFRAID TO COME TO JESUS FOR HE SAYS
2943-171001-0037 AND HE IS SUCH A PRECIOUS SAVIOUR SO KIND AND LOVING BUT REMEMBER THAT YOU MUST COME VERY HUMBLY FEELING THAT YOU ARE A GREAT SINNER AND NOT WORTHY TO BE HEARD AND ONLY HOPING TO BE FORGIVEN BECAUSE JESUS DIED THE BIBLE SAYS
2943-171001-0038 GOD RESISTETH THE PROUD BUT GIVETH GRACE UNTO THE HUMBLE
2943-171001-0039 ELSIE ANSWERED THE SUMMONS WITH A LIGHT HEART A HEART THAT THRILLED WITH A NEW AND STRANGE SENSE OF HAPPINESS AS SHE REMEMBERED HER FATHER'S EVIDENT ANXIETY FOR HER SAFETY DURING THEIR PERILOUS RIDE RECALLING EACH WORD AND LOOK
2943-171001-0040 AND FEELING AGAIN IN IMAGINATION THE CLASP OF HIS ARM ABOUT HER WAIST AH SURELY PAPA DOES LOVE ME SHE MURMURED TO HERSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND WHEN HE MET HER AT THE TABLE WITH A KIND SMILE
2943-171001-0041 HOW DOES MY LITTLE DAUGHTER DO THIS EVENING HER CHEEKS FLUSHED AND HER EYES GREW BRIGHT WITH HAPPINESS AND SHE LONGED TO THROW HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK AND TELL HIM HOW VERY VERY MUCH SHE LOVED HIM BUT THAT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE AT THE TABLE AND BEFORE ALL THE FAMILY
2943-171001-0042 SO SHE MERELY RAISED HER GLAD EYES TO HIS FACE AND ANSWERED I AM VERY WELL THANK YOU PAPA BUT AFTER ALL THIS OCCURRENCE PRODUCED BUT LITTLE CHANGE IN ELSIE'S CONDITION HER FATHER TREATED HER A LITTLE MORE AFFECTIONATELY FOR A DAY OR TWO
2943-171001-0043 AND THEN GRADUALLY RETURNED TO HIS ORDINARY STERN COLD MANNER INDEED BEFORE THE WEEK WAS OUT SHE WAS AGAIN IN SAD DISGRACE SHE WAS WALKING ALONE IN THE GARDEN ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HER ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED BY A SLIGHT FLUTTERING NOISE
2943-171001-0044 WHICH SEEMED TO PROCEED FROM AN ARBOR NEAR BY AND ON HASTILY TURNING IN TO ASCERTAIN THE CAUSE SHE FOUND A TINY AND BEAUTIFUL HUMMING BIRD CONFINED UNDER A GLASS VASE IN ITS STRUGGLES TO ESCAPE IT WAS FLUTTERING AND BEATING AGAINST THE WALLS OF ITS PRISON
2943-171001-0045 AND HAD OFTEN DRAWN HIS PERSECUTIONS UPON HERSELF BY INTERFERING IN BEHALF OF THE POOR VICTIM AND NOW THE THOUGHT INSTANTLY FLASHED UPON HER THAT THIS WAS SOME OF HIS WORK AND THAT HE WOULD RETURN ERE LONG TO CARRY OUT HIS CRUEL PURPOSES
2943-171001-0046 THEN SHE BEGAN TO THINK WITH A LITTLE TREMOR HOW ANGRY ARTHUR WOULD BE BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO THINK OF THAT NOW AND AFTER ALL SHE DID NOT STAND IN VERY GREAT DREAD OF THE CONSEQUENCES ESPECIALLY AS SHE FELT NEARLY SURE OF HER FATHER'S APPROVAL OF WHAT SHE HAD DONE
2943-171001-0047 HAVING SEVERAL TIMES HEARD HIM REPROVE ARTHUR FOR HIS CRUEL PRACTICES NOT CARING TO MEET ARTHUR THEN HOWEVER SHE HASTILY RETREATED TO THE HOUSE WHERE SHE SEATED HERSELF IN THE VERANDA WITH A BOOK IT WAS A VERY WARM AFTERNOON
2943-171001-0048 ARTHUR WALTER AND ENNA SAT ON THE FLOOR PLAYING JACK STONES A FAVORITE GAME WITH THEM
2943-171001-0049 HUSH SHE SAID AS WALTER GAVE A SUDDEN SHOUT AT A SUCCESSFUL TOSS ENNA HAD JUST MADE CAN'T YOU BE QUIET
2943-171001-0050 ELSIE WONDERED WHY ARTHUR DID NOT GO TO SEE AFTER HIS BIRD BUT SOON FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT IN THE INTEREST WITH WHICH SHE WAS PORING OVER THE STORY OF THE SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON THE JACK STONE PLAYERS WERE JUST FINISHING THEIR GAME
2943-171001-0051 WHEN THEY WERE ALL STARTLED BY THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF MISTER HORACE DINSMORE UPON THE SCENE
2943-171001-0052 WHO HAD BEEN DOWN IN THE GARDEN AND LIBERATED THE HUMMING BIRD HE HAD BEEN AT SUCH PAINS TO CATCH BECAUSE IT WAS ONE OF A RARE SPECIES
2943-171001-0053 GREW PALE AND RED BY TURNS WHILE SHE SEEMED CHOKING WITH THE VAIN EFFORT TO SPEAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE HERSELF THE CULPRIT AS CONSCIENCE TOLD HER SHE OUGHT BUT HER FATHER WAS NOT LOOKING AT HER HIS EYE WAS FIXED ON ARTHUR
2943-171001-0054 I PRESUME IT WAS YOU SIR HE SAID VERY ANGRILY AND IF SO YOU MAY PREPARE YOURSELF FOR EITHER A FLOGGING OR A RETURN TO YOUR PRISON FOR ONE OR THE OTHER I AM DETERMINED YOU SHALL HAVE I DIDN'T DO IT ANY SUCH THING REPLIED THE BOY FIERCELY
2943-171001-0055 OF COURSE YOU WILL DENY IT SAID HIS BROTHER BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT YOUR WORD IS GOOD FOR NOTHING PAPA
2943-171001-0056 ARTHUR DID NOT DO IT IT WAS I
2943-171001-0057 AS HE TURNED HIS FLASHING EYE UPON HER
2943-171001-0058 ELSIE'S BOOK FELL ON THE FLOOR AND COVERING HER FACE WITH BOTH HANDS SHE BURST INTO SOBS AND TEARS COME HERE TO ME THIS INSTANT HE SAID SEATING HIMSELF ON THE SETTEE FROM WHICH LOUISE HAD RISEN ON HIS ENTRANCE

2943-171001-0060 IT WAS ONLY THE OTHER DAY YOU BROKE A VALUABLE VASE HE FORGOT IN HIS ANGER HOW LITTLE SHE HAD REALLY BEEN TO BLAME FOR THAT AND NOW YOU HAVE CAUSED ME THE LOSS OF A RARE SPECIMEN WHICH I HAD SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME AND EFFORT IN PROCURING
2943-171001-0061 REALLY ELSIE I AM SORELY TEMPTED TO ADMINISTER A VERY SEVERE PUNISHMENT ELSIE CAUGHT AT THE ARM OF THE SETTEE FOR SUPPORT TELL ME WHAT YOU DID IT FOR WAS IT PURE LOVE OF MISCHIEF ASKED HER FATHER STERNLY TAKING HOLD OF HER ARM AND HOLDING HER UP BY IT
2943-171001-0062 NO PAPA SHE ANSWERED ALMOST UNDER HER BREATH I WAS SORRY FOR THE LITTLE BIRD I THOUGHT ARTHUR HAD PUT IT THERE TO TORTURE IT AND SO I LET IT GO
2943-171001-0063 AND THE TEARS FELL FASTER AND FASTER INDEED SAID HE YOU HAD NO BUSINESS TO MEDDLE WITH IT LET WHO WOULD HAVE PUT IT THERE WHICH HAND DID IT THIS ONE PAPA SOBBED THE CHILD INDICATING HER RIGHT HAND HE TOOK IT IN HIS AND HELD IT A MOMENT
2943-171001-0064 AND FOR A MOMENT HE WAS HALF INCLINED TO KISS AND FORGIVE HER BUT NO HE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH IRRITATED AT HIS LOSS AND THE REMEMBRANCE OF IT AGAIN AROUSED HIS ANGER AND WELL NIGH EXTINGUISHED THE LITTLE SPARK OF LOVE AND COMPASSION
2943-171001-0065 SHE SHOULD BE PUNISHED THOUGH HE WOULD NOT INFLICT PHYSICAL PAIN SEE ELSIE LAUGHED LOUISE MALICIOUSLY
2943-171001-0066 HUSH LOUISE EXCLAIMED HER BROTHER STERNLY YOU KNOW YOU ARE NOT SPEAKING TRULY AND THAT I WOULD AS SOON THINK OF CUTTING OFF MY OWN HAND AS MY CHILD'S YOU SHOULD NEVER SPEAK ANYTHING BUT TRUTH ESPECIALLY TO CHILDREN
2943-171001-0067 NO SAID HER BROTHER THAT IS A VERY BAD PLAN AND ONE WHICH I SHALL NEVER ADOPT ELSIE WILL LEARN IN TIME IF SHE DOES NOT KNOW IT NOW THAT I NEVER UTTER A THREAT WHICH I DO NOT INTEND TO CARRY OUT AND NEVER BREAK MY WORD HE HAD DRAWN A HANDKERCHIEF FROM HIS POCKET WHILE SPEAKING

2943-171001-0069 WALTER WHO WAS FAR MORE TENDER HEARTED THAN EITHER HIS BROTHER OR SISTER FELT TOUCHED BY THE SIGHT OF HER DISTRESS AND RAN AFTER HER TO SAY NEVER MIND ELSIE I AM EVER SO SORRY FOR YOU AND I DON'T THINK YOU WERE THE LEAST BIT NAUGHTY SHE THANKED HIM WITH A GRATEFUL LOOK
2943-171001-0070 THEN HURRIED ON TO HER ROOM WHERE SHE SEATED HERSELF IN A CHAIR BY THE WINDOW AND LAYING HER ARMS UPON THE SILL RESTED HER HEAD UPON THEM AND WHILE THE BITTER TEARS FELL FAST FROM HER EYES SHE MURMURED HALF ALOUD
2943-171001-0071 THEN AN EARNEST IMPORTUNATE PRAYER FOR HELP TO DO RIGHT AND WISDOM TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO GAIN HER FATHER'S LOVE WENT UP FROM THE ALMOST DESPAIRING LITTLE HEART TO HIM WHOSE EAR IS EVER OPEN UNTO THE CRY OF HIS SUFFERING CHILDREN
2943-171001-0072 AND THUS BETWEEN WEEPING MOURNING AND PRAYING AN HOUR PASSED SLOWLY AWAY AND THE TEA BELL RANG ELSIE STARTED UP BUT SAT DOWN AGAIN FEELING THAT SHE WOULD MUCH RATHER DO WITHOUT HER SUPPER
2943-171001-0073 YES SIR SHE ANSWERED IN A LOW TREMULOUS TONE VERY WELL THEN REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS TO COME DOWN THE MOMENT THE BELL RINGS UNLESS YOU ARE DIRECTED OTHERWISE OR ARE SICK AND THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE SO LATE I SHALL SEND YOU AWAY WITHOUT YOUR MEAL
