8499-256247-0021 AND DOST THOU UNDERSTAND THEM PARDON MOST WORTHY LORD BUT COULD I MANAGE A PROVINCE IF I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE PRINCE WAS CONFUSED AND FELL TO THINKING
8499-256247-0022 COULD IT BE REALLY THAT HE RAMESES WAS THE ONLY INCOMPETENT BUT IN THIS CASE WHAT WOULD BECOME OF HIS POWER SIT DOWN SAID HE AFTER A WHILE INDICATING A CHAIR TO THE NOMARCH
8499-256247-0023 ON THE CONTRARY I KNOW NO MAN WHO COULD MANAGE BETTER BUT I AM YOUNG AND CURIOUS TO KNOW THE ART OF GOVERNMENT SO I BEG THEE TO DEAL OUT TO ME CRUMBS OF THY KNOWLEDGE THOU ART RULING THE PROVINCE
8499-256247-0024 I KNOW THAT NOW EXPLAIN TO ME THE PROCESS THE NOMARCH DREW BREATH AND BEGAN I WILL RELATE WORTHINESS THE WHOLE COURSE OF MY LIFE SO THOU SHALT KNOW HOW WEIGHTY MY WORK IS
8499-256247-0025 IN THE MORNING I BATHE THEN I GIVE OFFERINGS TO THE GOD AMUT NEXT I SUMMON THE TREASURER AND ASK HIM WHETHER THE TAXES FOR HIS HOLINESS ARE COLLECTED PROPERLY
8499-256247-0026 WHEN HE ANSWERS YES I PRAISE HIM WHEN HE SAYS THAT THESE AND THOSE PEOPLE HAVE NOT PAID I ISSUE AN ORDER TO IMPRISON THE DISOBEDIENT THEN I SUMMON THE OVERSEERS OF THE ROYAL GRANARIES
8499-256247-0027 TO LEARN HOW MUCH GRAIN HAS BEEN DELIVERED IF MUCH I PRAISE THEM IF LITTLE I ISSUE AN ORDER TO INFLICT STRIPES ON THE GUILTY LATER COMES THE CHIEF SCRIBE

8499-256247-0030 AND DESECRATED A STATUE OF THE GOD SEBAK I WAS DELIGHTED IN HEART FOR THAT GOD IS NOT OUR PATRON STILL I CONDEMNED SOME OF THE GUILTY TO STRANGULATION SOME OF THEM TO THE QUARRIES
8499-256247-0031 HENCE PEACE AND GOOD HABITS PREVAIL IN MY PROVINCE AND THE TAXES FLOW IN DAILY
8499-256247-0032 ADDED RAMESES THOU SPEAKEST TRUTH LORD SIGHED THE WORTHY NOMARCH THE PRIESTS SAY THAT THE GODS ARE ANGRY WITH EGYPT BECAUSE OF THE INFLUX OF FOREIGNERS BUT I SEE THAT EVEN THE GODS DO NOT CONTEMN GOLD
8499-256247-0033 BOTH DIGNITARIES CONSENTED AND THE NOMARCH EXHIBITED SO MUCH PIETY THAT THE PRINCE WAS ASTONISHED
8499-256247-0034 HERHOR I BEG THEE TO EXPLAIN ONE THING WHICH FILLS MY HEART WITH ANXIETY SHALL I BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN ASKED THE PROPHET THOU WILT ANSWER ME FOR THOU ART FILLED WITH WISDOM OF WHICH THOU ART THE SERVANT
8499-256247-0035 THOU KNOWEST WHY HIS HOLINESS SENT ME HITHER HE SENT THEE PRINCE TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE WEALTH OF THE COUNTRY AND ITS INSTITUTIONS SAID MENTEZUFIS I AM OBEYING
8499-256247-0036 I EXAMINE THE NOMARCHS I LOOK AT THE COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE I LISTEN TO REPORTS OF SCRIBES BUT I UNDERSTAND NOTHING THIS POISONS MY LIFE AND ASTOUNDS ME WHEN I HAVE TO DO WITH THE ARMY
8499-256247-0037 THERE IS A HOSTILE CORPS I MUST TAKE TWO CORPS TO BEAT IT IF THE ENEMY IS IN A DEFENSIVE POSITION I SHOULD NOT MOVE WITHOUT THREE CORPS WHEN THE ENEMY IS UNDISCIPLINED AND FIGHTS IN UNORDERED CROWDS AGAINST A THOUSAND
8499-256247-0038 I SEND FIVE HUNDRED OF OUR SOLDIERS AND BEAT HIM WHEN THE OPPOSING SIDE HAS A THOUSAND MEN WITH AXES AND I A THOUSAND I RUSH AT THEM AND FINISH THOSE TROOPS IF I HAVE A HUNDRED MEN WITH SLINGS IN ADDITION
8499-256247-0039 IN THE ARMY HOLY FATHER CONTINUED RAMESES
8499-256247-0040 AS THE FINGERS ON MY HAND AND TO EVERY QUESTION AN ANSWER IS READY WHICH MY MIND COMPREHENDS MEANWHILE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF A PROVINCE I NOT ONLY SEE NOTHING BUT THERE IS SUCH CONFUSION IN MY HEAD
8499-256247-0041 THE HOLY PROPHET FELL TO THINKING WHETHER THEY ATTEMPT TO DECEIVE THEE WORTHINESS ANSWERED HE I KNOW NOT FOR I HAVE NOT EXAMINED THEIR ACTS IT SEEMS TO ME HOWEVER
8499-256247-0042 THAT THEY EXPLAIN NOTHING BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES COMPREHEND NOTHING THE NOMARCHS AND THEIR SCRIBES CONTINUED THE PRIEST ARE LIKE DECURIONS IN AN ARMY EACH ONE KNOWS HIS TEN MEN AND REPORTS ON THEM EACH COMMANDS THOSE UNDER HIM
8499-256247-0043 BUT THE DECURION KNOWS NOT THE GENERAL PLAN MADE BY LEADERS OF THE ARMY THE NOMARCHS AND THE SCRIBES WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THEIR PROVINCE AND LAY THOSE REPORTS AT THE FEET OF THE PHARAOH
8499-256247-0044 HOW IS THAT THEN IF I DO NOT BECOME A PRIEST WILL YE NOT EXPLAIN TO ME THERE ARE THINGS WORTHINESS WHICH THOU MAYEST KNOW EVEN NOW
8499-256247-0045 WHEN THOU ART THE PHARAOH THERE ARE STILL OTHERS WHICH ONLY A HIGH PRIEST MAY KNOW EVERY PHARAOH IS A HIGH PRIEST INTERRUPTED THE PRINCE NOT EVERY PHARAOH BESIDES EVEN AMONG HIGH PRIESTS
8499-256247-0046 THERE ARE GRADES OF DIFFERENCE THEN
8499-256247-0047 YE HIDE THE ORDER OF THE STATE FROM ME AND I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THE COMMANDS OF MY FATHER WHAT THE PRINCE NEEDS MAY BE KNOWN ANSWERED MENTEZUFIS QUIETLY FOR THOU HAST THE INFERIOR PRIESTLY CONSECRATION
8499-256247-0048 THOSE THINGS HOWEVER ARE HIDDEN BEHIND THE VEIL IN TEMPLES WHICH NO ONE WILL DARE TO DRAW ASIDE WITHOUT DUE PREPARATION I WILL DRAW IT MAY THE GODS DEFEND EGYPT FROM SUCH A MISFORTUNE
8499-256247-0049 REPLIED THE PRIEST AS HE RAISED BOTH HIS HANDS DOST THOU NOT KNOW WORTHINESS THAT A THUNDERBOLT WOULD KILL ANY MAN WHO WITHOUT THE NEEDED CEREMONIES SHOULD TOUCH THE VEIL
8499-256247-0050 WERE THE PRINCE TO TAKE TO THE TEMPLE ANY SLAVE OR CONDEMNED CRIMINAL AND LET HIM STRETCH OUT HIS HAND THE MAN WOULD DIE THAT SAME INSTANT FOR YE WOULD KILL HIM
8499-256247-0051 EACH ONE OF US WOULD DIE JUST LIKE AN ORDINARY CRIMINAL WERE HE TO APPROACH THE ALTAR SACRILEGIOUSLY IN PRESENCE OF THE GODS MY PRINCE A PHARAOH OR A PRIEST MEANS AS LITTLE AS A SLAVE
8499-256247-0052 WHAT AM I TO DO THEN ASKED RAMESES SEEK AN ANSWER TO THY TROUBLE IN THE TEMPLE AFTER THOU HAST PURIFIED THYSELF BY PRAYERS AND FASTING ANSWERED THE PRIEST
8499-256247-0053 WHILE EGYPT IS EGYPT NO RULER HAS GAINED WISDOM OF STATE IN ANOTHER WAY I WILL MEDITATE OVER THIS SAID THE PRINCE THOUGH I SEE FROM THY WORDS THAT THE MOST VENERABLE
