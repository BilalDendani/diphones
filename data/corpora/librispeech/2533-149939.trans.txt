2533-149939-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN LORD CHILTERN RIDES HIS HORSE BONEBREAKER
2533-149939-0001 IT WAS DECIDED THAT AN INDEPENDENT MOTION SHOULD BE BROUGHT ON IN ANTICIPATION OF MISTER MILDMAY'S BILL THE ARRANGEMENT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF MISTER MILDMAY'S OWN MAKING SO THAT HE MIGHT BE HAMPERED BY NO OPPOSITION ON THAT SUBJECT BY HIS OWN FOLLOWERS IF AS HE DID NOT DOUBT
2533-149939-0002 THE MOTION SHOULD BE LOST IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THE DEBATE WOULD NOT LAST OVER ONE NIGHT
2533-149939-0003 HE HAD VERY STRONG OPINIONS AS TO THE INEFFICACY OF THE BALLOT FOR ANY GOOD PURPOSES
2533-149939-0004 BUT EVEN AT BREAKFAST THAT MORNING HIS HEART BEGAN TO BEAT QUICKLY AT THE IDEA OF HAVING TO STAND ON HIS LEGS BEFORE SO CRITICAL AN AUDIENCE
2533-149939-0005 AND DID NOT EVEN TELL MISTER LOW THAT IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO SPEAK ON THAT DAY
2533-149939-0006 HE HAD NOT SEEN HER BROTHER BUT HAD LEARNED FROM HIS SISTER THAT HE HAD BEEN DRIVEN UP TO LONDON BY THE FROST
2533-149939-0007 HE WAS THUS DRIVEN TO SPEAK AND FELT HIMSELF CALLED UPON TO EXPLAIN WHY HE WAS THERE I AM COME TO SEE LORD CHILTERN HE SAID IS LORD CHILTERN IN THE HOUSE SAID THE EARL TURNING TO THE SERVANT YES MY LORD HIS LORDSHIP ARRIVED LAST NIGHT
2533-149939-0008 YOU WILL FIND HIM UPSTAIRS I SUPPOSE SAID THE EARL FOR MYSELF I KNOW NOTHING OF HIM
2533-149939-0009 AND TURNED HIS BACK QUICKLY UPON PHINEAS BUT HE THOUGHT BETTER OF IT BEFORE HE REACHED THE FRONT DOOR AND TURNED AGAIN BY THE BYE SAID HE WHAT MAJORITY SHALL WE HAVE TO NIGHT FINN PRETTY NEARLY AS MANY AS YOU PLEASE TO NAME MY LORD SAID PHINEAS
2533-149939-0010 WELL YES I SUPPOSE WE ARE TOLERABLY SAFE YOU OUGHT TO SPEAK UPON IT PERHAPS I MAY SAID PHINEAS FEELING THAT HE BLUSHED AS HE SPOKE DO SAID THE EARL DO IF YOU SEE LORD CHILTERN WILL YOU TELL HIM FROM ME THAT I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HIM BEFORE HE LEAVES LONDON
2533-149939-0011 PHINEAS MUCH ASTONISHED AT THE COMMISSION GIVEN TO HIM OF COURSE SAID THAT HE WOULD DO AS HE WAS DESIRED AND THEN PASSED ON TO LORD CHILTERN'S APARTMENTS HE FOUND HIS FRIEND STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WITHOUT COAT AND WAISTCOAT WITH A PAIR OF DUMB BELLS IN HIS HANDS
2533-149939-0012 WHEN THERE'S NO HUNTING I'M DRIVEN TO THIS KIND OF THING SAID LORD CHILTERN I SUPPOSE IT'S GOOD EXERCISE SAID PHINEAS AND IT GIVES ME SOMETHING TO DO WHEN I'M IN LONDON I FEEL LIKE A GIPSY IN CHURCH TILL THE TIME COMES FOR PROWLING OUT AT NIGHT
2533-149939-0013 I'VE NO OCCUPATION FOR MY DAYS WHATEVER AND NO PLACE TO WHICH I CAN TAKE MYSELF I CAN'T STAND IN A CLUB WINDOW AS SOME MEN DO AND I SHOULD DISGRACE ANY DECENT CLUB IF I DID STAND THERE I BELONG TO THE TRAVELLERS BUT I DOUBT WHETHER THE PORTER WOULD LET ME GO IN
2533-149939-0014 I THINK YOU PIQUE YOURSELF ON BEING MORE OF AN OUTER BOHEMIAN THAN YOU ARE SAID PHINEAS I PIQUE MYSELF ON THIS THAT WHETHER BOHEMIAN OR NOT I WILL GO NOWHERE THAT I AM NOT WANTED THOUGH FOR THE MATTER OF THAT I SUPPOSE I'M NOT WANTED HERE
2533-149939-0015 THEN PHINEAS GAVE HIM THE MESSAGE FROM HIS FATHER HE WISHES TO SEE ME TO MORROW MORNING CONTINUED LORD CHILTERN LET HIM SEND ME WORD WHAT IT IS HE HAS TO SAY TO ME I DO NOT CHOOSE TO BE INSULTED BY HIM THOUGH HE IS MY FATHER I WOULD CERTAINLY GO IF I WERE YOU
2533-149939-0016 I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH IF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE THE SAME LET HIM TELL ME WHAT HE WANTS OF COURSE I CANNOT ASK HIM CHILTERN I KNOW WHAT HE WANTS VERY WELL LAURA HAS BEEN INTERFERING AND DOING NO GOOD YOU KNOW VIOLET EFFINGHAM
2533-149939-0017 I DID NOT SAY THAT BUT DO YOU THINK THAT SUCH A GIRL AS MISS EFFINGHAM WOULD MARRY SUCH A MAN AS I AM
2533-149939-0018 BY GEORGE SHE WOULD DO YOU KNOW THAT SHE HAS THREE THOUSAND A YEAR OF HER OWN I KNOW THAT SHE HAS MONEY THAT'S ABOUT THE TUNE OF IT I WOULD TAKE HER WITHOUT A SHILLING TO MORROW IF SHE WOULD HAVE ME
2533-149939-0019 BUT WHAT IS THE USE OF MY LIKING HER THEY HAVE PAINTED ME SO BLACK AMONG THEM ESPECIALLY MY FATHER THAT NO DECENT GIRL WOULD THINK OF MARRYING ME YOUR FATHER CAN'T BE ANGRY WITH YOU IF YOU DO YOUR BEST TO COMPLY WITH HIS WISHES I DON'T CARE A STRAW WHETHER HE BE ANGRY OR NOT
2533-149939-0020 HE ALLOWS ME EIGHT HUNDRED A YEAR AND HE KNOWS THAT IF HE STOPPED IT I SHOULD GO TO THE JEWS THE NEXT DAY I COULD NOT HELP MYSELF
2533-149939-0021 LADY LAURA CAN HARDLY WANT MONEY NOW THAT DETESTABLE PRIG WHOM SHE HAS CHOSEN TO MARRY AND WHOM I HATE WITH ALL MY HEART IS RICHER THAN EVER CROESUS WAS BUT NEVERTHELESS LAURA OUGHT TO HAVE HER OWN MONEY SHE SHALL HAVE IT SOME DAY I WOULD SEE LORD BRENTFORD IF I WERE YOU

2533-149939-0023 I CAN MOUNT YOU FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND SHOULD BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU MY HORSES ALL PULL LIKE THE MISCHIEF
2533-149939-0024 BUT AN IRISHMAN LIKES THAT I DO NOT DISLIKE IT PARTICULARLY I LIKE IT
2533-149939-0025 MIND YOU COME THE HOUSE I STAY AT IS CALLED THE WILLINGFORD BULL AND IT'S JUST FOUR MILES FROM PETERBOROUGH PHINEAS SWORE THAT HE WOULD GO DOWN AND RIDE THE PULLING HORSES AND THEN TOOK HIS LEAVE EARNESTLY ADVISING LORD CHILTERN AS HE WENT TO KEEP THE APPOINTMENT PROPOSED BY HIS FATHER
2533-149939-0026 SUDDENLY RANG THE BELL TELL THE EARL HE SAID TO THE SERVANT THAT I AM HERE AND WILL GO TO HIM IF HE WISHES IT THE SERVANT CAME BACK AND SAID THAT THE EARL WAS WAITING
2533-149939-0027 I FEEL VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT YOUR SISTER'S FORTUNE SAID THE EARL SO DO I VERY UNHAPPY WE CAN RAISE THE MONEY BETWEEN US AND PAY HER TO MORROW IF YOU PLEASE IT
2533-149939-0028 I TOLD HER THAT I WOULD NOT PAY THEM AND WERE I
2533-149939-0029 I SHOULD BE STULTIFYING MYSELF BUT I WILL DO SO ON ONE CONDITION
2533-149939-0030 WHAT IS THAT LAURA TELLS ME
2533-149939-0031 THAT YOU ARE ATTACHED TO VIOLET EFFINGHAM BUT VIOLET EFFINGHAM MY LORD IS UNHAPPILY NOT ATTACHED TO ME I DO NOT KNOW HOW THAT MAY BE OF COURSE I CANNOT SAY
2533-149939-0032 EVEN YOU MY LORD COULD HARDLY HAVE DONE THAT
2533-149939-0033 I HAVE ASKED HER AND SHE HAS REFUSED ME BUT GIRLS OFTEN DO THAT AND YET ACCEPT AFTERWARDS THE MEN WHOM THEY HAVE REFUSED LAURA TELLS ME THAT SHE BELIEVES THAT VIOLET WOULD CONSENT IF YOU PRESSED YOUR SUIT LAURA KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT MY LORD THERE YOU ARE PROBABLY WRONG
2533-149939-0034 LAURA AND VIOLET ARE VERY CLOSE FRIENDS AND HAVE NO DOUBT DISCUSSED THIS MATTER BETWEEN THEM AT ANY RATE IT MAY BE AS WELL THAT YOU SHOULD HEAR WHAT I HAVE TO SAY OF COURSE I SHALL NOT INTERFERE MYSELF THERE IS NO GROUND ON WHICH I CAN DO SO WITH PROPRIETY NONE WHATEVER SAID LORD CHILTERN
2533-149939-0035 THE EARL BECAME VERY ANGRY AND NEARLY BROKE DOWN IN HIS ANGER
2533-149939-0036 BUT HE GULPED DOWN HIS WRATH AND WENT ON WITH HIS SPEECH MY MEANING SIR IS THIS
2533-149939-0037 THAT I WOULD RECEIVE HER ACCEPTANCE OF YOUR HAND AS THE ONLY PROOF WHICH WOULD BE CONVINCING TO ME OF AMENDMENT IN YOUR MODE OF LIFE IF SHE WERE TO DO SO I WOULD JOIN WITH YOU IN RAISING MONEY TO PAY YOUR SISTER WOULD MAKE SOME FURTHER SACRIFICE WITH REFERENCE TO AN INCOME FOR YOU AND YOUR WIFE AND
2533-149939-0038 WOULD MAKE YOU BOTH WELCOME TO SAULSBY IF YOU CHOSE TO COME THE EARL'S VOICE HESITATED MUCH AND BECAME ALMOST TREMULOUS AS HE MADE THE LAST PROPOSITION AND HIS EYES HAD FALLEN AWAY FROM HIS SON'S GAZE AND HE HAD BENT A LITTLE OVER THE TABLE AND WAS MOVED
2533-149939-0039 BUT HE RECOVERED HIMSELF AT ONCE AND ADDED WITH ALL PROPER DIGNITY IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY I SHALL BE GLAD TO HEAR IT ALL YOUR OFFERS WOULD BE NOTHING MY LORD IF I DID NOT LIKE THE GIRL I SHOULD NOT ASK YOU TO MARRY A GIRL IF YOU DID NOT LIKE HER AS YOU CALL IT
2533-149939-0040 BUT AS TO MISS EFFINGHAM IT HAPPENS THAT OUR WISHES JUMP TOGETHER I HAVE ASKED HER AND SHE HAS REFUSED ME I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO FIND HER TO ASK HER AGAIN IF I WENT TO LADY BALDOCK'S HOUSE THE SERVANTS WOULD NOT LET ME IN AND WHOSE FAULT IS THAT YOURS PARTLY MY LORD
2533-149939-0041 AND NOW ALL THE OLD WOMEN BELIEVE IT I NEVER TOLD ANYBODY SO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO I WILL GO DOWN TO LADY BALDOCK'S TO DAY I SUPPOSE SHE IS AT BADDINGHAM AND IF I CAN GET SPEECH OF MISS EFFINGHAM MISS EFFINGHAM IS NOT AT BADDINGHAM
2533-149939-0042 MISS EFFINGHAM IS STAYING WITH YOUR SISTER IN GROSVENOR PLACE I SAW HER YESTERDAY SHE IS IN LONDON I TELL YOU THAT I SAW HER YESTERDAY VERY WELL MY LORD THEN I WILL DO THE BEST I CAN LAURA WILL TELL YOU OF THE RESULT
2533-149939-0043 THE FATHER WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE SON SOME ADVICE AS TO THE MODE IN WHICH HE SHOULD PUT FORWARD HIS CLAIM UPON VIOLET'S HAND BUT THE SON WOULD NOT WAIT TO HEAR IT
2533-149939-0044 IF THIS THING WAS TO BE DONE IT MIGHT AS WELL BE DONE AT ONCE HE LOOKED OUT OF HIS WINDOW AND SAW THAT THE STREETS WERE IN A MESS OF SLUSH WHITE SNOW WAS BECOMING BLACK MUD
2533-149939-0045 AND THE VIOLENCE OF FROST WAS GIVING WAY TO THE HORRORS OF THAW ALL WOULD BE SOFT AND COMPARATIVELY PLEASANT IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND IF EVERYTHING WENT RIGHT HE WOULD BREAKFAST AT THE WILLINGFORD BULL HE WOULD GO DOWN BY THE HUNTING TRAIN
2533-149939-0046 THE MEET WAS ONLY SIX MILES DISTANT AND ALL WOULD BE PLEASANT HE WOULD DO THIS WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE RESULT OF HIS WORK TO DAY BUT IN THE MEANTIME HE WOULD GO AND DO HIS WORK
2533-149939-0047 I HOPE NOT SAID VIOLET DO NOT SAY THAT BUT I DO SAY IT I HOPE HE HAS NOT COME TO SEE ME THAT IS NOT TO SEE ME SPECIALLY
2533-149939-0048 IF IT BE ONLY THAT I WILL BE CIVIL IN RETURN AS SWEET AS MAY TO HIM
2533-149939-0049 THEN THEY FINISHED THEIR LUNCH AND LADY LAURA GOT UP AND LED THE WAY TO THE DRAWING ROOM I HOPE YOU REMEMBER SAID SHE GRAVELY THAT YOU MIGHT BE A SAVIOUR TO HIM I DO NOT BELIEVE IN GIRLS BEING SAVIOURS TO MEN
2533-149939-0050 IF I MARRY AT ALL I HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT PROTECTION SHALL BE GIVEN TO ME NOT THAT I SHALL HAVE TO GIVE IT VIOLET YOU ARE DETERMINED TO MISREPRESENT WHAT I MEAN LORD CHILTERN WAS WALKING ABOUT THE ROOM AND DID NOT SIT DOWN WHEN THEY ENTERED
2533-149939-0051 THE ORDINARY GREETINGS TOOK PLACE AND MISS EFFINGHAM MADE SOME REMARK ABOUT THE FROST
2533-149939-0052 AND I SUPPOSE THAT YOU WILL SOON BE AT WORK AGAIN YES I SHALL HUNT TO MORROW SAID LORD CHILTERN AND THE NEXT DAY AND THE NEXT AND THE NEXT SAID VIOLET TILL ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF APRIL AND THEN YOUR PERIOD OF MISERY WILL BEGIN
2533-149939-0053 EXACTLY SAID LORD CHILTERN I HAVE NOTHING BUT HUNTING THAT I CAN CALL AN OCCUPATION WHY DON'T YOU MAKE ONE SAID HIS SISTER
2533-149939-0054 LAURA WOULD YOU MIND LEAVING ME AND MISS EFFINGHAM ALONE FOR A FEW MINUTES LADY LAURA GOT UP
2533-149939-0055 FOR WHAT PURPOSE SAID THE LATTER IT CANNOT BE FOR ANY GOOD PURPOSE
2533-149939-0056 LAURA WILL YOU DO AS I ASK YOU SAID THE BROTHER THEN LADY LAURA WENT IT WAS NOT THAT I FEARED YOU WOULD HARM ME LORD CHILTERN SAID VIOLET NO I KNOW IT WAS NOT BUT WHAT I SAY IS ALWAYS SAID AWKWARDLY
2533-149939-0057 BUT WHEN I WAS TOLD THE NEWS I CAME AT ONCE MY FATHER TOLD ME I AM SO GLAD THAT YOU SEE YOUR FATHER I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO HIM FOR MONTHS BEFORE AND PROBABLY MAY NOT SPEAK TO HIM FOR MONTHS AGAIN BUT THERE IS ONE POINT VIOLET ON WHICH HE AND I AGREE
2533-149939-0058 I HOPE THERE WILL SOON BE MANY IT IS POSSIBLE BUT I FEAR NOT PROBABLE LOOK HERE VIOLET AND HE LOOKED AT HER WITH ALL HIS EYES TILL IT SEEMED TO HER THAT HE WAS ALL EYES SO GREAT WAS THE INTENSITY OF HIS GAZE
2533-149939-0059 I SHOULD SCORN MYSELF WERE I TO PERMIT MYSELF TO COME BEFORE YOU WITH A PLEA FOR YOUR FAVOUR FOUNDED ON MY FATHER'S WHIMS MY FATHER IS UNREASONABLE AND HAS BEEN VERY UNJUST TO ME HE HAS EVER BELIEVED EVIL OF ME
2533-149939-0060 AND HAS BELIEVED IT OFTEN WHEN ALL THE WORLD KNEW THAT HE WAS WRONG I CARE LITTLE FOR BEING RECONCILED TO A FATHER WHO HAS BEEN SO CRUEL TO ME HE LOVES ME DEARLY AND IS MY FRIEND I WOULD RATHER THAT YOU SHOULD NOT SPEAK AGAINST HIM TO ME
2533-149939-0061 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND AT LEAST THAT I AM ASKING NOTHING FROM YOU BECAUSE HE WISHES IT LAURA PROBABLY HAS TOLD YOU THAT YOU MAY MAKE THINGS STRAIGHT BY BECOMING MY WIFE SHE HAS CERTAINLY LORD CHILTERN IT IS AN ARGUMENT THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE USED
2533-149939-0062 IT IS AN ARGUMENT TO WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT LISTEN FOR A MOMENT MAKE THINGS STRAIGHT INDEED WHO CAN TELL
2533-149939-0063 VIOLET THAT IS MY PLEA AND MY ONLY ONE I LOVE YOU SO WELL THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT IF YOU TOOK ME I SHOULD RETURN TO THE OLD WAYS AND BECOME AS OTHER MEN ARE AND BE IN TIME AS RESPECTABLE AS STUPID AND PERHAPS
2533-149939-0064 AS ILL NATURED AS OLD LADY BALDOCK HERSELF MY POOR AUNT
2533-149939-0065 AS HE SPOKE HE CAME CLOSE TO HER AND PUT OUT HIS HAND BUT SHE DID NOT TOUCH IT I HAVE NO OTHER ARGUMENT TO USE NOT A WORD MORE TO SAY AS I CAME HERE IN THE CAB I WAS TURNING IT OVER IN MY MIND THAT I MIGHT FIND WHAT BEST I SHOULD SAY
2533-149939-0066 BUT AFTER ALL THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID THAN THAT THE WORDS MAKE NO DIFFERENCE SHE REPLIED NOT UNLESS THEY BE SO UTTERED AS TO FORCE A BELIEF I DO LOVE YOU I KNOW NO OTHER REASON BUT THAT WHY YOU SHOULD BE MY WIFE
2533-149939-0067 YOU ARE THE ONE THING IN THE WORLD THAT TO ME HAS ANY CHARM CAN YOU BE SURPRISED THAT I SHOULD BE PERSISTENT IN ASKING FOR IT HE WAS LOOKING AT HER STILL WITH THE SAME GAZE AND THERE SEEMED TO BE A POWER IN HIS EYE FROM WHICH SHE COULD NOT ESCAPE
2533-149939-0068 HE WAS STILL STANDING WITH HIS RIGHT HAND OUT AS THOUGH EXPECTING OR AT LEAST HOPING THAT HER HAND MIGHT BE PUT INTO HIS HOW AM I TO ANSWER YOU SHE SAID WITH YOUR LOVE IF YOU CAN GIVE IT TO ME DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU SWORE ONCE THAT YOU WOULD LOVE ME FOR EVER AND ALWAYS
2533-149939-0069 YOU SHOULD NOT REMIND ME OF THAT I WAS A CHILD THEN A NAUGHTY CHILD SHE ADDED SMILING AND WAS PUT TO BED FOR WHAT I DID ON THAT DAY BE A CHILD STILL AH IF WE BUT COULD AND HAVE YOU NO OTHER ANSWER TO MAKE ME
2533-149939-0070 OF COURSE I MUST ANSWER YOU YOU ARE ENTITLED TO AN ANSWER LORD CHILTERN I AM SORRY THAT I CANNOT GIVE YOU THE LOVE FOR WHICH YOU ASK NEVER NEVER IS IT MYSELF PERSONALLY OR WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD OF ME THAT IS SO HATEFUL TO YOU
2533-149939-0071 NOTHING IS HATEFUL TO ME I HAVE NEVER SPOKEN OF HATE I SHALL ALWAYS FEEL THE STRONGEST REGARD FOR MY OLD FRIEND AND PLAYFELLOW BUT THERE ARE MANY THINGS WHICH A WOMAN IS BOUND TO CONSIDER BEFORE SHE ALLOWS HERSELF SO TO LOVE A MAN THAT SHE CAN CONSENT TO BECOME HIS WIFE
2533-149939-0072 ALLOW HERSELF THEN IT IS A MATTER ENTIRELY OF CALCULATION I SUPPOSE THERE SHOULD BE SOME THOUGHT IN IT LORD CHILTERN THERE WAS NOW A PAUSE AND THE MAN'S HAND WAS AT LAST ALLOWED TO DROP AS THERE CAME NO RESPONSE TO THE PROFFERED GRASP
2533-149939-0073 HE WALKED ONCE OR TWICE ACROSS THE ROOM BEFORE HE SPOKE AGAIN AND THEN HE STOPPED HIMSELF CLOSELY OPPOSITE TO HER I SHALL NEVER TRY AGAIN HE SAID IT WILL BE BETTER SO SHE REPLIED
2533-149939-0074 THERE IS SOMETHING TO ME UNMANLY IN A MAN'S PERSECUTING A GIRL JUST TELL LAURA WILL YOU THAT IT IS ALL OVER AND SHE MAY AS WELL TELL MY FATHER GOOD BYE SHE THEN TENDERED HER HAND TO HIM BUT HE DID NOT TAKE IT
2533-149939-0075 PROBABLY DID NOT SEE IT AND AT ONCE LEFT THE ROOM AND THE HOUSE AND YET I BELIEVE YOU LOVE HIM LADY LAURA SAID TO HER FRIEND IN HER ANGER WHEN THEY DISCUSSED THE MATTER IMMEDIATELY ON LORD CHILTERN'S DEPARTURE YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY THAT LAURA
2533-149939-0076 IS A WOMAN BOUND TO MARRY A MAN IF SHE LOVE HIM YES SHE IS REPLIED LADY LAURA IMPETUOUSLY WITHOUT THINKING OF WHAT SHE WAS SAYING THAT IS IF SHE BE CONVINCED THAT SHE ALSO IS LOVED WHATEVER BE THE MAN'S CHARACTER
2533-149939-0077 WHATEVER BE THE CIRCUMSTANCES MUST SHE DO SO WHATEVER FRIENDS MAY SAY TO THE CONTRARY IS THERE TO BE NO PRUDENCE IN MARRIAGE THERE MAY BE A GREAT DEAL TOO MUCH PRUDENCE SAID LADY LAURA THAT IS TRUE
2533-149939-0078 THERE IS CERTAINLY TOO MUCH PRUDENCE IF A WOMAN MARRIES PRUDENTLY BUT WITHOUT LOVE VIOLET INTENDED BY THIS NO ATTACK UPON HER FRIEND HAD NOT HAD PRESENT IN HER MIND AT THE MOMENT ANY IDEA OF LADY LAURA'S SPECIAL PRUDENCE IN MARRYING MISTER KENNEDY
2533-149939-0079 BUT LADY LAURA FELT IT KEENLY AND KNEW AT ONCE THAT AN ARROW HAD BEEN SHOT WHICH HAD WOUNDED HER WE SHALL GET NOTHING SHE SAID BY DESCENDING TO PERSONALITIES WITH EACH OTHER
2533-149939-0080 I SUPPOSE IT IS ALWAYS HARD SAID LADY LAURA FOR ANY ONE PERSON TO JUDGE ALTOGETHER OF THE MIND OF ANOTHER IF I HAVE SAID ANYTHING SEVERE OF YOUR REFUSAL OF MY BROTHER I RETRACT IT I ONLY WISH THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE
2533-149939-0081 LORD CHILTERN WHEN HE LEFT HIS SISTER'S HOUSE WALKED THROUGH THE SLUSH AND DIRT TO A HAUNT OF HIS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF COVENT GARDEN AND THERE HE REMAINED THROUGH THE WHOLE AFTERNOON AND EVENING A CERTAIN CAPTAIN CLUTTERBUCK JOINED HIM AND DINED WITH HIM
2533-149939-0082 HE TOLD NOTHING TO CAPTAIN CLUTTERBUCK OF HIS SORROW BUT CAPTAIN CLUTTERBUCK COULD SEE THAT HE WAS UNHAPPY LET'S HAVE ANOTHER BOTTLE OF CHAM SAID CAPTAIN CLUTTERBUCK WHEN THEIR DINNER WAS NEARLY OVER CHAM IS THE ONLY THING TO SCREW ONE UP WHEN ONE IS DOWN A PEG
2533-149939-0083 BUT I SHALL HAVE SOME BRANDY AND WATER THE WORST OF BRANDY AND WATER IS THAT ONE GETS TIRED OF IT BEFORE THE NIGHT IS OVER SAID CAPTAIN CLUTTERBUCK NEVERTHELESS LORD CHILTERN DID GO DOWN TO PETERBOROUGH THE NEXT DAY BY THE HUNTING TRAIN
2533-149939-0084 AND RODE HIS HORSE BONEBREAKER SO WELL IN THAT FAMOUS RUN FROM SUTTON SPRINGS TO GIDDING THAT AFTER THE RUN YOUNG PILES OF THE HOUSE OF PILES SARSNET AND GINGHAM OFFERED HIM THREE HUNDRED POUNDS FOR THE ANIMAL HE ISN'T WORTH ABOVE FIFTY SAID LORD CHILTERN
2533-149939-0085 BUT I'LL GIVE YOU THE THREE HUNDRED SAID PILES YOU COULDN'T RIDE HIM IF YOU'D GOT HIM SAID LORD CHILTERN
