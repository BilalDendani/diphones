1513-140222-0000 PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE SOCRATES ION SOCRATES WELCOME ION ARE YOU FROM YOUR NATIVE CITY OF EPHESUS ION NO SOCRATES

1513-140222-0003 FOR YOU HAVE ALWAYS TO WEAR FINE CLOTHES AND TO LOOK AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU CAN IS A PART OF YOUR ART THEN AGAIN YOU ARE OBLIGED
1513-140222-0004 WHO IS THE BEST AND MOST DIVINE OF THEM AND TO UNDERSTAND HIM AND NOT MERELY LEARN HIS WORDS BY ROTE IS A THING GREATLY TO BE ENVIED
1513-140222-0005 OUGHT TO INTERPRET THE MIND OF THE POET TO HIS HEARERS BUT HOW CAN HE INTERPRET HIM WELL UNLESS HE KNOWS WHAT HE MEANS ALL THIS IS GREATLY TO BE ENVIED ION VERY TRUE SOCRATES
1513-140222-0006 INTERPRETATION HAS CERTAINLY BEEN THE MOST LABORIOUS PART OF MY ART AND I BELIEVE MYSELF ABLE TO SPEAK ABOUT HOMER BETTER THAN ANY MAN AND THAT NEITHER METRODORUS OF LAMPSACUS
1513-140222-0007 I AM GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY SO ION I SEE THAT YOU WILL NOT REFUSE TO ACQUAINT ME WITH THEM ION CERTAINLY SOCRATES AND YOU REALLY OUGHT TO HEAR HOW EXQUISITELY I RENDER HOMER
1513-140222-0008 DOES YOUR ART EXTEND TO HESIOD AND ARCHILOCHUS OR TO HOMER ONLY ION TO HOMER ONLY
1513-140222-0009 I CAN INTERPRET THEM EQUALLY WELL SOCRATES WHERE THEY AGREE SOCRATES BUT WHAT ABOUT MATTERS IN WHICH THEY DO NOT AGREE FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT DIVINATION
1513-140222-0010 CLEARLY SOCRATES BUT HOW DID YOU COME TO HAVE THIS SKILL ABOUT HOMER ONLY
1513-140222-0011 AND THE GENERATIONS OF GODS AND HEROES ARE NOT THESE THE THEMES OF WHICH HOMER SINGS ION VERY TRUE SOCRATES SOCRATES AND DO NOT THE OTHER POETS SING OF THE SAME
1513-140222-0012 ION YES SOCRATES BUT NOT IN THE SAME WAY AS HOMER SOCRATES WHAT IN A WORSE WAY ION YES IN A FAR WORSE SOCRATES AND HOMER IN A BETTER WAY
1513-140222-0013 ION HE IS INCOMPARABLY BETTER SOCRATES AND YET SURELY MY DEAR FRIEND ION IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT ARITHMETIC WHERE MANY PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING
1513-140222-0014 AND ONE SPEAKS BETTER THAN THE REST THERE IS SOMEBODY WHO CAN JUDGE WHICH OF THEM IS THE GOOD SPEAKER ION YES SOCRATES
1513-140222-0015 ION YES SOCRATES WELL AND IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE WHOLESOMENESS OF FOOD WHEN MANY PERSONS ARE SPEAKING AND ONE SPEAKS BETTER THAN THE REST
1513-140222-0016 WILL HE WHO RECOGNIZES THE BETTER SPEAKER
1513-140222-0017 OR THE SAME ION CLEARLY THE SAME SOCRATES AND WHO IS HE AND WHAT IS HIS NAME ION THE PHYSICIAN SOCRATES AND SPEAKING GENERALLY
1513-140222-0018 IN ALL DISCUSSIONS IN WHICH THE SUBJECT IS THE SAME AND MANY MEN ARE SPEAKING WILL NOT HE WHO KNOWS THE GOOD KNOW THE BAD SPEAKER ALSO FOR IF HE DOES NOT KNOW THE BAD
1513-140222-0019 NEITHER WILL HE KNOW THE GOOD WHEN THE SAME TOPIC IS BEING DISCUSSED ION TRUE SOCRATES IS NOT THE SAME PERSON SKILFUL IN BOTH ION YES
1513-140222-0020 SOCRATES AND YOU SAY THAT HOMER AND THE OTHER POETS
1513-140222-0021 SPEAK OF THE SAME THINGS ALTHOUGH NOT IN THE SAME WAY BUT THE ONE SPEAKS WELL AND THE OTHER NOT SO WELL ION YES AND I AM RIGHT IN SAYING SO SOCRATES
1513-140222-0022 AND IF YOU KNEW THE GOOD SPEAKER YOU WOULD ALSO KNOW THE INFERIOR SPEAKERS TO BE INFERIOR ION THAT IS TRUE SOCRATES THEN MY DEAR FRIEND
1513-140222-0023 CAN I BE MISTAKEN IN SAYING THAT ION IS EQUALLY SKILLED IN HOMER AND IN OTHER POETS SINCE HE HIMSELF ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE SAME PERSON WILL BE A GOOD JUDGE
1513-140222-0024 OF ALL THOSE WHO SPEAK OF THE SAME THINGS AND THAT ALMOST ALL POETS DO SPEAK OF THE SAME THINGS ION WHY THEN SOCRATES DO I LOSE ATTENTION AND GO TO SLEEP
1513-140222-0025 AND HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEAS OF THE LEAST VALUE WHEN ANY ONE SPEAKS OF ANY OTHER POET BUT WHEN HOMER IS MENTIONED I WAKE UP AT ONCE AND AM ALL ATTENTION AND HAVE PLENTY TO SAY SOCRATES
1513-140222-0026 OTHER POETS FOR POETRY IS A WHOLE ION YES SOCRATES AND WHEN ANY ONE ACQUIRES ANY OTHER ART AS A WHOLE THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF THEM
1513-140222-0027 WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO EXPLAIN MY MEANING ION ION YES INDEED SOCRATES I VERY MUCH WISH THAT YOU WOULD FOR I LOVE TO HEAR YOU WISE MEN TALK SOCRATES O THAT WE WERE WISE ION
1513-140222-0028 AND THAT YOU COULD TRULY CALL US SO BUT YOU RHAPSODES AND ACTORS AND THE POETS WHOSE VERSES YOU SING ARE WISE WHEREAS I AM A COMMON MAN WHO ONLY SPEAK THE TRUTH FOR CONSIDER
1513-140222-0029 A THING WHICH ANY MAN MIGHT SAY THAT WHEN A MAN HAS ACQUIRED A KNOWLEDGE OF A WHOLE ART THE ENQUIRY INTO GOOD AND BAD IS ONE AND THE SAME LET US CONSIDER THIS MATTER
1513-140222-0030 IS NOT THE ART OF PAINTING A WHOLE ION YES SOCRATES AND THERE ARE AND HAVE BEEN MANY PAINTERS GOOD AND BAD ION YES SOCRATES
1513-140222-0031 AND DID YOU EVER KNOW ANY ONE WHO WAS SKILFUL IN POINTING OUT THE EXCELLENCES AND DEFECTS OF POLYGNOTUS THE SON OF AGLAOPHON BUT INCAPABLE OF CRITICIZING OTHER PAINTERS
1513-140222-0032 AND WHEN THE WORK OF ANY OTHER PAINTER WAS PRODUCED WENT TO SLEEP AND WAS AT A LOSS AND HAD NO IDEAS BUT WHEN HE HAD TO GIVE HIS OPINION ABOUT POLYGNOTUS OR WHOEVER THE PAINTER MIGHT BE AND ABOUT HIM ONLY
1513-140222-0033 WOKE UP AND WAS ATTENTIVE AND HAD PLENTY TO SAY ION NO INDEED I HAVE NEVER KNOWN SUCH A PERSON SOCRATES OR
1513-140222-0034 WHO WAS SKILFUL IN EXPOUNDING THE MERITS OF DAEDALUS THE SON OF METION OR OF EPEIUS THE SON OF PANOPEUS OR OF THEODORUS THE SAMIAN OR OF ANY INDIVIDUAL SCULPTOR
1513-140222-0035 BUT WHEN THE WORKS OF SCULPTORS IN GENERAL WERE PRODUCED WAS AT A LOSS AND WENT TO SLEEP AND HAD NOTHING TO SAY ION NO INDEED NO MORE THAN THE OTHER SOCRATES
1513-140222-0036 OR THAMYRAS OR ORPHEUS OR PHEMIUS
1513-140222-0037 BUT WAS AT A LOSS WHEN HE CAME TO SPEAK OF ION OF EPHESUS AND HAD NO NOTION OF HIS MERITS OR DEFECTS ION I CANNOT DENY WHAT YOU SAY SOCRATES
1513-140222-0038 AND THE WORLD AGREES WITH ME IN THINKING
1513-140222-0039 AND I WILL PROCEED TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT I IMAGINE TO BE THE REASON OF THIS THE GIFT WHICH YOU POSSESS OF SPEAKING EXCELLENTLY ABOUT HOMER IS NOT AN ART BUT
1513-140222-0040 AS I WAS JUST SAYING AN INSPIRATION THERE IS A DIVINITY MOVING YOU LIKE THAT CONTAINED IN THE STONE WHICH EURIPIDES CALLS A MAGNET BUT WHICH IS COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE STONE OF HERACLEA
1513-140222-0041 SUSPENDED FROM ONE ANOTHER SO AS TO FORM QUITE A LONG CHAIN AND ALL OF THEM DERIVE THEIR POWER OF SUSPENSION FROM THE ORIGINAL STONE IN LIKE MANNER
1513-140222-0042 THE MUSE FIRST OF ALL INSPIRES MEN HERSELF AND FROM THESE INSPIRED PERSONS A CHAIN OF OTHER PERSONS IS SUSPENDED WHO TAKE THE INSPIRATION FOR ALL GOOD POETS
1513-140222-0043 EPIC AS WELL AS LYRIC COMPOSE THEIR BEAUTIFUL POEMS NOT BY ART BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE INSPIRED AND POSSESSED AND AS THE CORYBANTIAN REVELLERS WHEN THEY DANCE ARE NOT IN THEIR RIGHT MIND
1513-140222-0044 LIKE BACCHIC MAIDENS WHO DRAW MILK AND HONEY FROM THE RIVERS WHEN THEY ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DIONYSUS BUT NOT WHEN THEY ARE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND AND THE SOUL OF THE LYRIC POET DOES THE SAME
1513-140222-0045 AS THEY THEMSELVES SAY FOR THEY TELL US THAT THEY BRING SONGS FROM HONEYED FOUNTAINS CULLING THEM OUT OF THE GARDENS AND DELLS OF THE MUSES
1513-140222-0046 WINGING THEIR WAY FROM FLOWER TO FLOWER AND THIS IS TRUE FOR THE POET IS A LIGHT AND WINGED AND HOLY THING AND THERE IS NO INVENTION IN HIM UNTIL HE HAS BEEN INSPIRED
1513-140222-0047 THEY ARE SIMPLY INSPIRED TO UTTER THAT TO WHICH THE MUSE IMPELS THEM AND THAT ONLY AND WHEN INSPIRED
1513-140222-0048 AND HE WHO IS GOOD AT ONE IS NOT GOOD AT ANY OTHER KIND OF VERSE FOR NOT BY ART DOES THE POET SING BUT BY POWER DIVINE HAD HE LEARNED BY RULES OF ART
1513-140222-0049 HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN HOW TO SPEAK
1513-140222-0050 AND USES THEM AS HIS MINISTERS AS HE ALSO USES DIVINERS AND HOLY PROPHETS IN ORDER THAT WE WHO HEAR THEM MAY KNOW THEM TO BE SPEAKING NOT OF THEMSELVES
1513-140222-0051 WHO UTTER THESE PRICELESS WORDS IN A STATE OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS BUT THAT GOD HIMSELF IS THE SPEAKER
1513-140222-0052 HE IS CONVERSING WITH US AND TYNNICHUS THE CHALCIDIAN AFFORDS A STRIKING INSTANCE OF WHAT I AM SAYING
1513-140222-0053 BUT THE FAMOUS PAEAN WHICH IS IN EVERY ONE'S MOUTH ONE OF THE FINEST POEMS EVER WRITTEN SIMPLY AN INVENTION OF THE MUSES AS HE HIMSELF SAYS FOR IN THIS WAY
1513-140222-0054 AND THAT THE POETS ARE ONLY THE INTERPRETERS OF THE GODS BY WHOM THEY ARE SEVERALLY POSSESSED WAS NOT THIS THE LESSON WHICH THE GOD INTENDED TO TEACH WHEN BY THE MOUTH
1513-140222-0055 OF THE WORST OF POETS HE SANG THE BEST OF SONGS AM I NOT RIGHT ION ION YES INDEED SOCRATES I FEEL THAT YOU ARE FOR YOUR WORDS TOUCH MY SOUL
1513-140222-0056 AND I AM PERSUADED THAT GOOD POETS BY A DIVINE INSPIRATION INTERPRET THE THINGS OF THE GODS TO US SOCRATES AND YOU RHAPSODISTS
1513-140222-0057 ARE THE INTERPRETERS OF THE POETS ION THERE AGAIN YOU ARE RIGHT SOCRATES THEN YOU ARE THE INTERPRETERS OF INTERPRETERS ION PRECISELY SOCRATES
1513-140222-0058 I WISH YOU WOULD FRANKLY TELL ME ION WHAT I AM GOING TO ASK OF YOU WHEN YOU PRODUCE THE GREATEST EFFECT UPON THE AUDIENCE IN THE RECITATION OF SOME STRIKING PASSAGE SUCH AS THE APPARITION OF ODYSSEUS
1513-140222-0059 LEAPING FORTH ON THE FLOOR RECOGNIZED BY THE SUITORS AND CASTING HIS ARROWS AT HIS FEET OR THE DESCRIPTION OF ACHILLES RUSHING AT HECTOR OR THE SORROWS OF ANDROMACHE HECUBA OR PRIAM
1513-140222-0060 ARE YOU IN YOUR RIGHT MIND ARE YOU NOT CARRIED OUT OF YOURSELF AND DOES NOT YOUR SOUL IN AN ECSTASY SEEM TO BE AMONG THE PERSONS OR PLACES OF WHICH YOU ARE SPEAKING
1513-140222-0061 WHETHER THEY ARE IN ITHACA OR IN TROY OR WHATEVER MAY BE THE SCENE OF THE POEM ION THAT PROOF STRIKES HOME TO ME SOCRATES FOR I MUST FRANKLY CONFESS THAT AT THE TALE OF PITY
1513-140222-0062 MY EYES ARE FILLED WITH TEARS AND WHEN I SPEAK OF HORRORS MY HAIR STANDS ON END AND MY HEART THROBS SOCRATES WELL ION AND WHAT ARE WE TO SAY OF A MAN
1513-140222-0063 WHO AT A SACRIFICE OR FESTIVAL WHEN HE IS DRESSED IN HOLIDAY ATTIRE AND HAS GOLDEN CROWNS UPON HIS HEAD OF WHICH NOBODY HAS ROBBED HIM APPEARS WEEPING OR PANIC STRICKEN
1513-140222-0064 IN THE PRESENCE OF MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND FRIENDLY FACES WHEN THERE IS NO ONE DESPOILING OR WRONGING HIM IS HE IN HIS RIGHT MIND OR IS HE NOT ION NO INDEED SOCRATES
1513-140222-0065 I MUST SAY THAT STRICTLY SPEAKING HE IS NOT IN HIS RIGHT MIND SOCRATES AND ARE YOU AWARE THAT YOU PRODUCE SIMILAR EFFECTS ON MOST OF THE SPECTATORS ION ONLY TOO WELL
1513-140222-0066 FOR I LOOK DOWN UPON THEM FROM THE STAGE AND BEHOLD THE VARIOUS EMOTIONS OF PITY WONDER STERNNESS STAMPED UPON THEIR COUNTENANCES WHEN I AM SPEAKING AND I AM OBLIGED
1513-140222-0067 DO YOU KNOW THAT THE SPECTATOR IS THE LAST OF THE RINGS WHICH AS I AM SAYING RECEIVE THE POWER OF THE ORIGINAL MAGNET FROM ONE ANOTHER THE RHAPSODE LIKE YOURSELF
1513-140222-0068 AND THE ACTOR ARE INTERMEDIATE LINKS AND THE POET HIMSELF IS THE FIRST OF THEM THROUGH ALL THESE THE GOD SWAYS THE SOULS OF MEN IN ANY DIRECTION WHICH HE PLEASES
1513-140222-0069 AT THE SIDE OF THE RINGS WHICH HANG DOWN FROM THE MUSE AND EVERY POET HAS SOME MUSE FROM WHOM HE IS SUSPENDED AND BY WHOM HE IS SAID TO BE POSSESSED WHICH IS NEARLY THE SAME THING
1513-140222-0070 FOR HE IS TAKEN HOLD OF AND FROM THESE FIRST RINGS WHICH ARE THE POETS DEPEND OTHERS SOME DERIVING THEIR INSPIRATION FROM ORPHEUS
1513-140222-0071 BUT THE GREATER NUMBER ARE POSSESSED AND HELD BY HOMER OF WHOM ION YOU ARE ONE AND ARE POSSESSED BY HOMER AND WHEN ANY ONE REPEATS THE WORDS OF ANOTHER POET YOU GO TO SLEEP
1513-140222-0072 AND KNOW NOT WHAT TO SAY BUT WHEN ANY ONE RECITES A STRAIN OF HOMER YOU WAKE UP IN A MOMENT AND YOUR SOUL LEAPS WITHIN YOU AND YOU HAVE PLENTY TO SAY FOR NOT BY ART
1513-140222-0073 OR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOMER DO YOU SAY WHAT YOU SAY BUT BY DIVINE INSPIRATION AND BY POSSESSION JUST AS THE CORYBANTIAN REVELLERS TOO HAVE A QUICK PERCEPTION OF THAT STRAIN
1513-140222-0074 ONLY WHICH IS APPROPRIATED TO THE GOD BY WHOM THEY ARE POSSESSED AND HAVE PLENTY OF DANCES AND WORDS FOR THAT BUT TAKE NO HEED OF ANY OTHER AND YOU ION WHEN THE NAME OF HOMER IS MENTIONED
1513-140222-0075 HAVE PLENTY TO SAY AND HAVE NOTHING TO SAY OF OTHERS YOU ASK WHY IS THIS THE ANSWER IS THAT YOU PRAISE HOMER NOT BY ART BUT BY DIVINE INSPIRATION
1513-140222-0076 ION THAT IS GOOD SOCRATES AND YET I DOUBT WHETHER YOU WILL EVER HAVE ELOQUENCE ENOUGH TO PERSUADE ME THAT I PRAISE HOMER ONLY WHEN I AM MAD AND POSSESSED AND IF YOU COULD HEAR ME SPEAK OF HIM
1513-140222-0077 NOT SURELY ABOUT EVERY PART ION THERE IS NO PART SOCRATES ABOUT WHICH I DO NOT SPEAK WELL OF THAT I CAN ASSURE YOU SOCRATES
