1752-16632-0005 HER MISTRESS LOOKED UP FROM THE FIRE WHERE THE BIT OF WRITING WAS WRITHING PAINFULLY AND CAUGHT THE EXPRESSION OF NORAH'S FACE WHAT HAVE YOU THERE SHE ASKED FROWNING
1752-16632-0006 AS SHE TOOK THE OBJECT INTO HER OWN HANDS THE CHRISTMAS ANGEL SHE EXCLAIMED UNDER HER BREATH I HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN IT THEN AS IF IT BURNED HER FINGERS

1752-16632-0013 MOREOVER SHE WAS YOUNG AND WARM AND ENTHUSIASTIC SOMETIMES THE SPELL OF MISS TERRY'S SOMBRE HOUSE THREATENED HER TO THE POINT OF DESPERATION IT WAS SO THIS CHRISTMAS EVE
1752-16632-0014 BUT SHE MADE HER REQUEST WITH APPARENT CALMNESS YES GO ALONG ASSENTED HER MISTRESS UNGRACIOUSLY THANK YOU M SAID THE SERVANT DEMURELY BUT WITH A BRIGHTENING OF HER BLUE EYES AND PRESENTLY
1752-16632-0015 MUTTERED MISS TERRY GIVING THE FIRE A VICIOUS POKE SHE WAS ALONE IN THE HOUSE ON CHRISTMAS EVE AND NOT A MAN WOMAN OR CHILD IN THE WORLD CARED WELL IT WAS WHAT SHE WANTED
1752-16632-0016 IT WAS OF HER OWN DOING IF SHE HAD WISHED SHE SAT BACK IN HER CHAIR WITH THIN LONG HANDS LYING ALONG THE ARMS OF IT GAZING INTO THE FIRE A BIT OF PAPER THERE WAS CRUMBLING INTO ASHES
1752-16632-0017 ALONE ON CHRISTMAS EVE EVEN NORAH HAD SOME RELATION WITH THE WORLD OUTSIDE WAS THERE NOT A STALWART OFFICER WAITING FOR HER ON THE NEAREST CORNER
1752-16632-0018 EVEN NORAH COULD FEEL A SIMPLE CHILDISH PLEASURE IN CANDLES AND CAROLS AND MERRIMENT AND THE OLD OLD SUPERSTITION STUFF AND NONSENSE MUSED MISS TERRY SCORNFULLY
1752-16632-0019 WHAT IS OUR CHRISTMAS ANYWAY A TIME FOR SHOPKEEPERS TO SELL AND FOR FOOLISH FOLKS TO KILL THEMSELVES IN BUYING CHRISTMAS SPIRIT NO IT IS ALL HUMBUG ALL SELFISHNESS AND WORRY
1752-16632-0020 I AM GLAD I AM OUT OF IT I AM GLAD NO ONE EXPECTS ANYTHING OF ME NOR I OF ANY ONE I AM QUITE INDEPENDENT BLESSEDLY INDEPENDENT OF THE WHOLE FOOLISH BUSINESS
1752-16632-0021 IT IS A GOOD TIME TO BEGIN CLEARING UP FOR THE NEW YEAR I'M GLAD I THOUGHT OF IT I'VE LONG THREATENED TO GET RID OF THE STUFF THAT HAS BEEN ACCUMULATING IN THAT CORNER OF THE ATTIC NOW I WILL BEGIN
1752-16632-0022 SHE TUGGED THE PACKING CASE AN INCH NEARER THE FIRE IT WAS LIKE MISS TERRY TO INSIST UPON THAT NEARER INCH THEN SHE RAISED THE COVER
1752-16632-0023 IT WAS A BOX FULL OF CHILDREN'S BATTERED TOYS OLD FASHIONED AND QUAINT THE TOYS IN VOGUE THIRTY FORTY FIFTY YEARS EARLIER WHEN MISS TERRY WAS A CHILD SHE GAVE A REMINISCENT SNIFF AS SHE THREW UP THE COVER
1752-16632-0024 SHE SNORTED THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL IN THAT HUMPH IT MEANT
1752-16632-0025 WHILE POOR LITTLE ANGELINA HAD TO SQUEEZE IN AS WELL AS SHE COULD HOW LIKE TOM THIS ACCOUNTED FOR EVERYTHING EVEN TO HIS NOT BEING IN HIS SISTER'S HOUSE THIS VERY NIGHT HOW UNREASONABLE HE HAD BEEN
1752-16632-0026 MISS TERRY SHRUGGED IMPATIENTLY WHY THINK OF TOM TO NIGHT YEARS AGO HE HAD DELIBERATELY CUT HIMSELF ADRIFT FROM HER INTERESTS NO NEED TO THINK OF HIM NOW IT WAS TOO LATE TO APPEASE HER
1752-16632-0027 BUT HERE WERE ALL THESE TOYS TO BE GOT RID OF THE FIRE WAS HUNGRY FOR THEM WHY NOT BEGIN MISS TERRY STOOPED TO POKE OVER THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX WITH LEAN LONG FINGERS
1752-16632-0028 IN ONE CORNER THRUST UP A DOLL'S ARM IN ANOTHER AN ANIMAL'S TAIL POINTED HEAVENWARD SHE CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF GLITTER AND TINSEL
1752-16632-0029 WHAT RUBBISH SHE SAID YES I'LL BURN THEM ALL THEY ARE GOOD FOR NOTHING ELSE I SUPPOSE SOME FOLKS WOULD TRY TO GIVE THEM AWAY AND BORE A LOT OF PEOPLE TO DEATH THEY SEEM TO THINK THEY ARE SAVING SOMETHING THAT WAY
1752-16632-0030 NONSENSE I KNOW BETTER IT IS ALL FOOLISHNESS THIS CRAZE FOR GIVING MOST THINGS ARE BETTER DESTROYED AS SOON AS YOU ARE DONE WITH THEM WHY NOBODY WANTS SUCH TRUCK AS THIS
1752-16632-0031 NOW COULD ANY CHILD EVER HAVE CARED FOR SO SILLY A THING SHE PULLED OUT A FADED JUMPING JACK AND REGARDED IT SCORNFULLY IDIOTIC SUCH TOYS ARE DEMORALIZING FOR CHILDREN WEAKEN THEIR MINDS
1752-16632-0032 IT IS A SHAME TO THINK HOW EVERY ONE SEEMS BOUND TO SPOIL CHILDREN ESPECIALLY AT CHRISTMAS TIME WELL NO ONE CAN SAY THAT I HAVE ADDED TO THE SHAMEFUL WASTE MISS TERRY TOSSED THE POOR JUMPING JACK ON THE FIRE
1752-16632-0033 AND EYED HIS LAST CONTORTIONS WITH GRIM SATISFACTION BUT AS SHE WATCHED A QUAINT IDEA CAME TO HER SHE WAS FAMOUS FOR ECCENTRIC IDEAS I WILL TRY AN EXPERIMENT
1752-16632-0034 SHE SAID I WILL PROVE ONCE FOR ALL MY POINT ABOUT THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT I WILL DROP SOME OF THESE OLD TOYS OUT ON THE SIDEWALK AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS IT MAY BE INTERESTING
1752-16632-0035 CHAPTER TWO JACK IN THE BOX MISS TERRY ROSE AND CROSSED TWO ROOMS TO THE FRONT WINDOW LOOKING OUT UPON THE STREET
1752-16632-0036 A FLARE OF LIGHT ALMOST BLINDED HER EYES EVERY WINDOW OPPOSITE HER ALONG THE BLOCK AS FAR AS SHE COULD SEE WAS ILLUMINATED WITH A ROW OF LIGHTED CANDLES ACROSS THE SASH
1752-16632-0037 THE SOFT UNUSUAL GLOW THREW INTO RELIEF THE PRETTY CURTAINS AND WREATHS OF GREEN AND GAVE GLIMPSES OF COSY INTERIORS AND FLITTING HAPPY FIGURES WHAT A WASTE OF CANDLES SCOLDED MISS TERRY
1752-16632-0038 FOLKS ARE GROWING TERRIBLY EXTRAVAGANT THE STREET WAS WHITE WITH SNOW WHICH HAD FALLEN A FEW HOURS EARLIER PILED IN DRIFTS ALONG THE CURB OF THE LITTLE TRAVELED TERRACE
1752-16632-0039 BUT THE SIDEWALKS WERE NEATLY SHOVELED AND SWEPT CLEAN AS BECAME THE EMINENTLY RESPECTABLE PART OF THE CITY WHERE MISS TERRY LIVED A LONG FLIGHT OF STEPS WITH IRON RAILING AT THE SIDE LED DOWN FROM THE FRONT DOOR
1752-16632-0040 ANNOUNCED THE NAME OF TERRY MISS TERRY RETURNED TO THE PLAY BOX AND DREW OUT BETWEEN THUMB AND FINGER THE TOPMOST TOY IT HAPPENED TO BE A WOODEN BOX WITH A WIRE HASP FOR FASTENING THE COVER
1752-16632-0041 HALF UNCONSCIOUSLY SHE PRESSED THE SPRING AND A HIDEOUS JACK IN THE BOX SPRANG OUT TO CONFRONT HER WITH A SQUEAK A LEERING SMILE AND A RED NOSE MISS TERRY EYED HIM WITH DISFAVOR
1752-16632-0042 I ALWAYS DID HATE THAT THING SHE SAID TOM WAS CONTINUALLY FRIGHTENING ME WITH IT I REMEMBER AS IF TO BE RID OF UNWELCOME MEMORIES SHE SHUT HER MOUTH TIGHT
1752-16632-0043 EVEN AS SHE SHUT JACK BACK INTO HIS BOX SNAPPING THE SPRING INTO PLACE THIS WILL DO TO BEGIN WITH SHE THOUGHT SHE CROSSED TO THE WINDOW WHICH SHE OPENED QUICKLY AND TOSSED OUT THE BOX
1752-16632-0044 SO THAT IT FELL SQUARELY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SIDEWALK THEN CLOSING THE WINDOW AND TURNING DOWN THE LIGHTS IN THE ROOM BEHIND HER MISS TERRY HID IN THE FOLDS OF THE CURTAIN AND WATCHED TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO JACK
1752-16632-0045 THE STREET WAS QUIET FEW PERSONS PASSED ON EITHER SIDE AT LAST SHE SPIED TWO LITTLE RAGAMUFFINS APPROACHING
1752-16632-0046 THE SMALLER BOY FIRST CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE BOX IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SIDEWALK
1752-16632-0047 HE GRUNTED MAKING A DASH UPON IT GEE WOT'S UP RESPONDED THE OTHER WHO WAS INSTANTLY AT HIS ELBOW GWAN
1752-16632-0048 THE SMALLER BOY DREW AWAY AND PRESSED THE SPRING OF THE BOX EAGERLY
1752-16632-0049 OUT POPPED THE JACK INTO HIS ASTONISHED FACE WHEREUPON HE SET UP A GUFFAW GIVE IT HERE COMMANDED THE BIGGER BOY NAW YOU LET IT ALONE IT'S MINE ASSERTED THE OTHER
1752-16632-0050 EDGING AWAY ALONG THE CURBSTONE I SAW IT FIRST YOU CAN'T HAVE IT GIVE IT HERE I SAW IT FIRST MYSELF HAND IT OVER OR I'LL SMASH YOU THE BIGGER BOY ADVANCED THREATENINGLY
1752-16632-0051 I WON'T THE OTHER WHIMPERED CLASPING THE BOX TIGHTLY UNDER HIS JACKET HE STARTED TO RUN BUT THE BIGGER FELLOW WAS TOO QUICK FOR HIM HE POUNCED ACROSS THE SIDEWALK
1752-16632-0052 AND SOON THE TWAIN WERE STRUGGLING IN THE SNOWDRIFT PUMMELING ONE ANOTHER WITH MIGHT AND MAIN I TOLD YOU SO COMMENTED MISS TERRY FROM BEHIND THE CURTAIN
1752-16632-0053 HERE'S THE FIRST SHOW OF THE BEAUTIFUL CHRISTMAS SPIRIT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABROAD LOOK AT THE LITTLE BEASTS FIGHTING OVER SOMETHING THAT NEITHER OF THEM REALLY WANTS
1752-16632-0054 JUST THEN MISS TERRY SPIED A BLUE COATED FIGURE LEISURELY APPROACHING AT THE SAME MOMENT AN INSTINCT SEEMED TO WARN THE STRUGGLING URCHINS COP SAID A MUFFLED VOICE FROM THE PILE OF ARMS AND LEGS
1752-16632-0055 AND IN AN INSTANT TWO BLACK SHADOWS WERE FLITTING DOWN THE STREET BUT NOT BEFORE THE BIGGER BOY HAD WRENCHED THE BOX FROM THE POCKET OF THE LITTLE CHAP SO THAT IS THE END OF EXPERIMENT NUMBER ONE
1752-16632-0056 QUOTH MISS TERRY SMILING GRIMLY IT HAPPENED JUST ABOUT AS I EXPECTED THEY WILL BE FIGHTING AGAIN AS SOON AS THEY ARE OUT OF SIGHT THEY ARE JEWS BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE ABOUT THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT
1752-16632-0057 NOW LET'S SEE WHAT BECOMES OF THE NEXT EXPERIMENT CHAPTER THREE THE FLANTON DOG SHE RETURNED TO THE PLAY BOX BY THE FIRE
1752-16632-0058 AND RUMMAGED FOR A FEW MINUTES AMONG THE TANGLED TOYS THEN WITH SOMETHING LIKE A CHUCKLE SHE DREW OUT A SOFT PALE CREATURE WITH FOUR WOBBLY LEGS THE FLANTON DOG SHE SAID WELL I VOW
1752-16632-0059 I HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT HIM IT WAS TOM WHO COINED THE NAME FOR HIM BECAUSE HE WAS MADE OF CANTON FLANNEL SHE STOOD THE THING UP ON THE TABLE AS WELL AS HIS WEAK LEGS WOULD ALLOW AND INSPECTED HIM CRITICALLY
1752-16632-0060 HE CERTAINLY WAS A FORLORN SPECIMEN ONE OF THE BLACK BEADS WHICH HAD SERVED HIM FOR EYES WAS GONE HIS EARS WHICH HAD ORIGINALLY STOOD UP SAUCILY ON HIS HEAD NOW DROOPED IN LIMP DEJECTION
1752-16632-0061 ONE OF THEM WAS A MERE SHAPELESS RAG HANGING BY A THREAD HE WAS DIRTY AND DISCOLORED AND HIS TAIL WAS GONE BUT STILL HE SMILED WITH HIS RED THREAD MOUTH AND SEEMED TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST OF THINGS
1752-16632-0062 SAID MISS TERRY CONTEMPTUOUSLY I KNOW THERE ISN'T A CHILD IN THE CITY WHO WANTS SUCH A LOOKING THING WHY EVEN THE ANIMAL RESCUE FOLKS WOULD GIVE THE BOYS A FREE SHOT AT THAT
1752-16632-0063 THIS ISN'T GOING TO BRING OUT ANY CHRISTMAS SPIRIT SHE SNEERED I WILL TRY IT AND SEE ONCE MORE SHE LIFTED THE WINDOW AND TOSSED THE DOG TO THE SIDEWALK
1752-16632-0064 HE ROLLED UPON HIS BACK AND LAY PATHETICALLY WITH CROOKED LEGS YEARNING UPWARD STILL SMILING HARDLY HAD MISS TERRY TIME TO CONCEAL HERSELF BEHIND THE CURTAIN WHEN SHE SAW A FIGURE APPROACHING AIRILY WAVING A STICK
1752-16632-0065 NO RAGAMUFFIN THIS TIME SHE SAID HELLO IT IS THAT GOOD FOR NOTHING YOUNG COOPER FELLOW FROM THE NEXT BLOCK THEY SAY HE IS A MILLIONAIRE WELL HE ISN'T EVEN GOING TO SEE THE FLANTON DOG
1752-16632-0066 THE YOUNG MAN CAME SWINGING ALONG DEBONAIRLY HE WAS WHISTLING UNDER HIS BREATH HE WAS A DAPPER FIGURE IN A LONG COAT AND A SILK HAT UNDER WHICH THE CANDLES LIGHTED A RATHER SILLY FACE
1752-16632-0067 WHEN HE REACHED THE SPOT IN THE SIDEWALK WHERE THE FLANTON DOG LAY HE PAUSED A MOMENT LOOKING DOWN THEN HE POKED THE OBJECT WITH HIS STICK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET A MOTHER AND HER LITTLE BOY WERE PASSING AT THE TIME
1752-16632-0068 THE CHILD'S EYES CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE DOG ON THE SIDEWALK AND HE HUNG BACK WATCHING TO SEE WHAT THE YOUNG MAN WOULD DO TO IT BUT HIS MOTHER DREW HIM AFTER HER JUST THEN AN AUTOMOBILE CAME PANTING THROUGH THE SNOW
1752-16632-0069 WITH A QUICK MOVEMENT COOPER PICKED UP THE DOG ON THE END OF HIS STICK AND TOSSED IT INTO THE STREET UNDER THE WHEELS OF THE MACHINE THE BABY ACROSS THE STREET UTTERED A HOWL OF ANGUISH AT THE SIGHT
1752-16632-0070 MISS TERRY HERSELF WAS SURPRISED TO FEEL A PANG SHOOT THROUGH HER AS THE CAR PASSED OVER THE QUEER OLD TOY SHE RETREATED FROM THE WINDOW QUICKLY WELL THAT'S THE END OF FLANTON
1752-16632-0071 SHE SAID WITH HALF A SIGH I KNEW THAT FELLOW WAS A BRUTE I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT IT LOOKED SO SO SHE HESITATED FOR A WORD AND DID NOT FINISH HER SENTENCE
1752-16632-0072 BUT BIT HER LIP AND SNIFFED CYNICALLY CHAPTER FOUR
1752-16632-0073 NOW WHAT COMES NEXT MISS TERRY RUMMAGED IN THE BOX UNTIL HER FINGERS MET SOMETHING ODD SHAPED LONG AND SMOOTH SIDED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY SHE DREW OUT THE OBJECT
1752-16632-0074 SHE SAID I WONDER IF ALL THE ANIMALS ARE IN THERE SHE LIFTED THE COVER AND TURNED OUT INTO HER LAP THE LONG IMPRISONED ANIMALS AND THEIR ROUND BODIED CHIEF
1752-16632-0075 MISSUS NOAH AND HER SONS HAD LONG SINCE DISAPPEARED BUT THE ARK BUILDER HATLESS AND ONE ARMED STILL PRESIDED OVER A MENAGERIE OF SORRY BEASTS
1752-16632-0076 TO FEW OF THEM THE YEARS HAD SPARED A TAIL FROM THEIR CLOSE RESEMBLANCE IN THEIR MISERY IT WAS NOT HARD TO BELIEVE IN THE KINSHIP OF ALL ANIMAL LIFE SHE TOOK THEM UP AND EXAMINED THEM CURIOUSLY ONE BY ONE
1752-16632-0077 FINALLY SHE SELECTED A SHAPELESS SLATE COLORED BLOCK FROM THE MASS THIS WAS THE ELEPHANT SHE MUSED I REMEMBER WHEN TOM STEPPED ON HIM AND SMASHED HIS TRUNK
1752-16632-0078 I GUESS I'M GOING TO BE AN EXPRESSMAN WHEN I GROW UP HE SAID LOOKING SORRY TOM WAS ALWAYS FULL OF HIS JOKES NOW I'LL TRY THIS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ARK ON ITS LAST VOYAGE
1752-16632-0079 JUST THEN THERE WAS A NOISE OUTSIDE AN AUTOMOBILE HONKED PAST AND MISS TERRY SHUDDERED RECALLING THE PATHETIC END OF THE FLANTON DOG WHICH HAD GIVEN HER QUITE A TURN
1752-16632-0080 I HATE THOSE HORRID MACHINES SHE EXCLAIMED THEY SEEM LIKE JUGGERNAUT I'D LIKE TO FORBID THEIR GOING THROUGH THIS STREET SHE CROWDED THE ELEPHANT WITH NOAH AND THE REST OF HIS CHARGE BACK INTO THE ARK
1752-16632-0081 AND CLOSED THE LID I CAN'T THROW THIS OUT OF THE WINDOW SHE REFLECTED THEY WOULD SPILL I MUST TAKE IT OUT ON THE SIDEWALK LAND THE FIRE'S GOING OUT
1752-16632-0082 THAT GIRL DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO BUILD FIRES SO THEY WILL KEEP SHE LAID THE NOAH'S ARK ON THE TABLE AND GOING TO THE CLOSET TUGGED OUT SEVERAL BIG LOGS WHICH SHE ARRANGED GEOMETRICALLY
1752-16632-0083 ABOUT LAYING FIRES AS ABOUT MOST OTHER THINGS MISS TERRY HAD HER OWN POSITIVE THEORIES TAKING THE BELLOWS IN HAND SHE BLEW FURIOUSLY AND WAS PRESENTLY REWARDED WITH A BRISK BLAZE
1752-16632-0084 SHE SMILED WITH SATISFACTION AND TROTTED UPSTAIRS TO FIND HER RED KNIT SHAWL WITH THIS ABOUT HER SHOULDERS SHE WAS PREPARED TO BRAVE THE DECEMBER FROST DOWN THE STEPS SHE WENT
1752-16632-0085 AND DEPOSITED THE ARK DISCREETLY AT THEIR FOOT THEN RETURNED TO TAKE UP HER POSITION BEHIND THE CURTAINS THERE WERE A GOOD MANY PEOPLE PASSING BUT THEY SEEMED TOO PREOCCUPIED TO GLANCE DOWN AT THE SIDEWALK
1752-16632-0086 THEY WERE NEARLY ALL HURRYING IN ONE DIRECTION SOME WERE RUNNING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET THEY ARE IN A GREAT HURRY SNIFFED MISS TERRY DISDAINFULLY ONE WOULD THINK THEY HAD SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT ON HAND
1752-16632-0087 I SUPPOSE THEY ARE GOING TO HEAR THE SINGING FIDDLESTICK A MAN HASTENED BY UNDER THE WINDOW A WOMAN TWO CHILDREN A BOY AND A GIRL RUNNING AND GESTICULATING EAGERLY
1752-16632-0088 NONE OF THEM NOTICED THE NOAH'S ARK LYING AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS MISS TERRY BEGAN TO GROW IMPATIENT ARE THEY ALL BLIND SHE FRETTED WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THEM
1752-16632-0089 I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD FIND THE THING I AM TIRED OF SEEING IT LYING THERE SHE TAPPED THE FLOOR IMPATIENTLY WITH HER SLIPPER JUST THEN A WOMAN APPROACHED
1752-16632-0090 SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE MOST UNCOMPROMISING OF MOURNING AND SHE WALKED SLOWLY WITH BENT HEAD NEVER GLANCING AT THE LIGHTED WINDOWS ON EITHER SIDE SHE WILL SEE IT COMMENTED MISS TERRY
1752-16632-0091 AND SURE ENOUGH SHE DID SHE STOPPED AT THE DOORSTEP DREW HER SKIRTS ASIDE AND BENT OVER TO LOOK AT THE STRANGE SHAPED BOX AT HER FEET FINALLY SHE LIFTED IT BUT IMMEDIATELY
1752-16632-0092 SHE SHIVERED AND ACTED SO STRANGELY THAT MISS TERRY THOUGHT SHE WAS ABOUT TO BREAK THE TOY IN PIECES ON THE STEPS OR THROW IT INTO THE STREET EVIDENTLY SHE DETESTED THE SIGHT OF IT JUST THEN
1752-16632-0093 UP CAME A SECOND WOMAN WITH TWO SMALL BOYS HANGING AT HER SKIRTS THEY WERE RAGGED AND SICK LOOKING THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE EXPRESSION OF EVEN THE TINY KNOT OF HAIR AT THE BACK OF THE WOMAN'S HEAD WHICH TOLD OF ANXIOUS POVERTY
1752-16632-0094 WITH ENVIOUS CURIOSITY SHE HURRIED UP TO SEE WHAT A LUCKIER MORTAL HAD FOUND CROWDING TO LOOK OVER HER SHOULDER THE WOMAN IN BLACK DREW HAUGHTILY AWAY AND CLUTCHED THE NOAH'S ARK WITH A GESTURE OF PROPRIETORSHIP
1752-16632-0095 MISS TERRY READ HER EXPRESSION AND SNIFFED THERE IS THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT COMING OUT AGAIN SHE SAID TO HERSELF LOOK AT HER FACE THE BLACK GOWNED WOMAN PREPARED TO MOVE ON WITH THE TOY UNDER HER ARM
1752-16632-0096 BUT THE SECOND WOMAN CAUGHT HOLD OF HER SKIRT AND BEGAN TO SPEAK EARNESTLY SHE POINTED TO THE NOAH'S ARK THEN TO HER TWO CHILDREN HER EYES WERE BESEECHING THE LITTLE BOYS CROWDED FORWARD EAGERLY
1752-16632-0097 BUT SOME WICKED SPIRIT SEEMED TO HAVE SEIZED THE FINDER OF THE ARK ANGRILY SHE SHOOK OFF THE HAND OF THE OTHER WOMAN AND CLUTCHING THE BOX YET MORE FIRMLY UNDER HER ARM SHE HURRIED AWAY
1752-16632-0098 ONCE TWICE SHE TURNED AND SHOOK HER HEAD AT THE RAGGED WOMAN WHO FOLLOWED HER THEN WITH A SAVAGE GESTURE AT THE TWO CHILDREN SHE DISAPPEARED BEYOND MISS TERRY'S STRAINING EYES
1752-16632-0099 THE POOR WOMAN AND HER BOYS FOLLOWED FORLORNLY AT A DISTANCE THEY REALLY WANTED IT THAT OLD NOAH'S ARK EXCLAIMED MISS TERRY IN AMAZEMENT I CAN SCARCELY BELIEVE IT BUT WHY DID THAT OTHER CREATURE KEEP THE THING
