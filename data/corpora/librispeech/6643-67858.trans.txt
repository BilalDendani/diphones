6643-67858-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN WHERE IS SYLVIA THE BUTTERFLY WAS ALL READY AND WAITING FOR ITS PASSENGERS WHEN GRACE AND SYLVIA FOLLOWED BY THE SMILING AND DELIGHTED ESTRALLA
6643-67858-0001 WHO WAS CARRYING SYLVIA'S CAPE AND TRYING TO ACT AS MUCH LIKE A RALE GROWN UP LADY'S MAID AS POSSIBLE CAME DOWN TO THE LONG WHARF ALTHOUGH IT WAS DECEMBER THERE WAS LITTLE TO REMIND ANYONE OF WINTER THE AIR WAS SOFT AND CLEAR
6643-67858-0002 THE SUN SHONE BRIGHTLY AND ONLY A LITTLE WESTERLY BREEZE RUFFLED THE BLUE WATERS OF THE HARBOR NEGROES WERE AT WORK ON THE WHARF LOADING BALES OF COTTON ON A BIG SHIP THEY WERE SINGING AS THEY WORKED
6643-67858-0003 MISTER FULTON CAME TO MEET THEM AND HELPED THEM ON BOARD THE BOAT AS THE BUTTERFLY MADE ITS WAY OUT INTO THE CHANNEL THE LITTLE GIRLS LOOKED BACK AT THE LONG WATER FRONT WHERE LAY MANY VESSELS FROM FAR OFF PORTS IN THE DISTANCE THEY COULD SEE THE SPIRE OF SAINT PHILIP'S
6643-67858-0004 ONE OF THE HISTORIC CHURCHES OF CHARLESTON AND EVERYWHERE FLUTTERED THE PALMETTO FLAG SYLVIA SAT IN THE STERN BESIDE HER FATHER AND VERY SOON THE TILLER WAS IN HER HAND AND SHE WAS SHAPING THE BOAT'S COURSE TOWARD THE FORTS
6643-67858-0005 GRACE WATCHED HER ADMIRINGLY I BELIEVE YOU COULD STEER IN THE DARK SHE DECLARED OF COURSE SHE COULD IF SHE HAD A COMPASS AND WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE STARS SAID MISTER FULTON
6643-67858-0006 AND HE CALLED GRACE'S ATTENTION TO THE COMPASS FASTENED SECURELY NEAR SYLVIA'S SEAT AND EXPLAINED THE RULES OF NAVIGATION IS THAT THE WAY THE BIG SHIPS KNOW HOW TO FIND THEIR HARBORS ASKED GRACE WHEN MISTER FULTON TOLD HER OF THE STARS AND HOW THE PILOTS SET THEIR COURSE
6643-67858-0007 YES AND IF SYLVIA UNDERSTOOD HOW TO STEER BY THE COMPASS SHE COULD STEER THE BUTTERFLY AS WELL AT NIGHT AS SHE CAN NOW SYLVIA LOOKED AT THE COMPASS WITH A NEW INTEREST SHE WAS SURE THAT NAVIGATION WOULD BE A MUCH MORE INTERESTING STUDY THAN GRAMMAR
6643-67858-0008 THERE HAD BEEN MANY CHANGES AT FORT MOULTRIE SINCE SYLVIA'S LAST VISIT A DEEP DITCH HAD BEEN DUG BETWEEN THE FORT AND THE SAND BARS AND MANY WORKMEN WERE BUSY IN STRENGTHENING THE DEFENCES AND SYLVIA AND GRACE WONDERED WHY SO MANY SOLDIERS WERE STATIONED ALONG THE PARAPET
6643-67858-0009 CAPTAIN CARLETON SEEMED VERY GLAD TO WELCOME THEM AND SENT A SOLDIER TO ESCORT THE GIRLS TO THE OFFICERS QUARTERS WHILE MISTER FULTON WENT IN SEARCH OF MAJOR ANDERSON SYLVIA WONDERED IF SHE WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO TELL MISSUS CARLETON THAT SHE HAD SAFELY DELIVERED THE MESSAGE
6643-67858-0010 MISSUS CARLETON WAS IN HER PLEASANT SITTING ROOM AND DECLARED THAT SHE HAD BEEN WISHING FOR COMPANY AND HELD UP SOME STRIPS OF RED AND WHITE BUNTING I AM MAKING A NEW FLAG FOR FORT SUMTER SHE SAID PERHAPS YOU WILL HELP ME SEW ON THE STARS ONE FOR EACH STATE YOU KNOW
6643-67858-0011 IS THERE ONE FOR SOUTH CAROLINA ASKED GRACE AS MISSUS CARLETON FOUND TWO SMALL THIMBLES WHICH SHE SAID SHE HAD USED WHEN SHE WAS NO OLDER THAN SYLVIA AND SHOWED THE GIRLS HOW TO SEW THE WHITE STARS SECURELY ON THE BLUE
6643-67858-0012 AND NOW FOUND HERSELF NEAR THE LANDING PLACE SO THAT WHEN MISSUS CARLETON MADE THE GIRLS A CUP OF HOT CHOCOLATE AND LOOKED ABOUT TO GIVE ESTRALLA HER SHARE THE LITTLE COLORED GIRL WAS NOT TO BE SEEN I'LL CALL HER SAID SYLVIA AND RAN OUT ON THE VERANDA
6643-67858-0013 NO RESPONSE CAME TO HER CALLS SO SHE WENT DOWN THE STEPS AND ALONG THE WALK WHICH LED TO THE SAND BARS PAST THE HOUSES AND BARRACKS ON SULLIVAN'S ISLAND NO ONE WAS IN SIGHT WHOM SHE COULD ASK IF ESTRALLA HAD PASSED THAT WAY
6643-67858-0014 SHE CLIMBED A SMALL SAND HILL COVERED WITH STUNTED LITTLE TREES AND LOOKED ABOUT BUT COULD SEE NO TRACE OF THE LITTLE DARKY IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO SYLVIA THAT ESTRALLA WOULD GO BACK TO THE FORT
6643-67858-0015 ESTRALLA ESTRALLA AND SURE THAT IF SHE WAS WITHIN HEARING ESTRALLA WOULD INSTANTLY APPEAR AS SYLVIA CLIMBED OVER THE SANDY SLOPE SHE SAW HERE AND THERE A SMALL GREEN VINE WITH GLOSSY LEAVES AND A TINY YELLOW BLOSSOM
6643-67858-0016 ALMOST FORGETTING HER SEARCH FOR ESTRALLA AND FINALLY DECIDING THAT IT WAS TIME TO GO BACK TO MISSUS CARLETON PROBABLY ESTRALLA IS THERE BEFORE THIS AND THEY WILL BE LOOKING FOR ME SHE THOUGHT AND CLIMBED ANOTHER SANDY SLOPE EXPECTING TO SEE THE HOUSES AND BARRACKS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HER
6643-67858-0017 BUT SHE FOUND HERSELF FACING THE OPEN SEA
6643-67858-0018 AND SHE WOULD SOON BE IN SIGHT OF SOME FAMILIAR PLACE
6643-67858-0019 IT WAS RATHER DIFFICULT WALKING HER FEET SLIPPED IN THE SAND AND AFTER A LITTLE SYLVIA DECIDED NOT TO FOLLOW THE SHORE BUT TO CLIMB BACK OVER THE SAND HILLS A COLD WIND WAS NOW BLOWING FROM THE WATER
6643-67858-0020 AND SHE WAS GLAD OF THE SHELTER OF THE STUNTED TREES AND DECIDED TO REST FOR A LITTLE WHILE OF COURSE I CAN'T BE LOST BECAUSE I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I AM THIS IS SULLIVAN ISLAND AND THE FORT IS RIGHT OVER THERE I MUSTN'T REST BUT A MINUTE FOR MY FATHER SAID WE WOULD START HOME EARLY SHE THOUGHT
6643-67858-0021 THE DECEMBER DAY DREW TO A CLOSE AND DUSKY SHADOWS CREPT OVER THE ISLAND ONCE OR TWICE SYLVIA'S WANDERINGS HAD BROUGHT HER BACK TO THE SHORE BUT NOT UNTIL THE DARKNESS BEGAN TO GATHER DID SHE REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WAS LOST
6643-67858-0022 FEELING ALMOST SURE THAT LIKE HERSELF ESTRALLA MUST BE WANDERING ABOUT LOST IN THE SAND HILLS IT WAS NEARLY DARK BEFORE SHE GAVE UP TRYING TO FIND HER WAY TO THE FORT AND SHIVERING AND HALF AFRAID
6643-67858-0023 CRAWLED UNDER THE SCRAGGLY BRANCHES OF SOME STUNTED TREES ON A SHELTERED SLOPE MY FATHER WILL COME AND FIND ME I KNOW HE WILL SHE SAID ALOUD ALMOST READY TO CRY I'LL WAIT HERE AND KEEP CALLING ESTRALLA SO HE WILL HEAR ME
6643-67858-0024 A FEW MOMENTS AFTER SYLVIA STARTED TO FIND ESTRALLA MISSUS CARLETON HAD BEEN CALLED TO A NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE TELL SYLVIA I WON'T BE GONE LONG SHE HAD SAID TO GRACE GRACE DID NOT MIND BEING ALONE UNTIL SYLVIA RETURNED
6643-67858-0025 SHE HELPED HERSELF TO THE RICH CREAMY CHOCOLATE AND THE LITTLE FROSTED CAKES AND THEN CURLED UP ON A BROAD COUCH NEAR THE WINDOW WITH A BOOK FULL OF WONDERFUL PICTURES THE PICTURES WERE OF A TALL MAN ON HORSEBACK AND A SHORT FAT MAN ON A DONKEY
6643-67858-0026 THE ADVENTURES OF DON QUIXOTE WAS THE TITLE OF THE BOOK AND AFTER GRACE BEGAN TO READ SHE ENTIRELY FORGOT SYLVIA ESTRALLA AND MISSUS CARLETON AND NOT UNTIL MISTER FULTON CAME INTO THE ROOM AN HOUR LATER DID SHE LIFT HER EYES FROM THE BOOK
6643-67858-0027 ALL READY TO START SAID MISTER FULTON AND IT WILL BE DUSK BEFORE WE REACH HOME WHERE IS SYLVIA OH EXCLAIMED GRACE LOOKING UP IN SURPRISE HASN'T SHE COME BACK WITH ESTRALLA MISSUS CARLETON HAS JUST GONE TO THE NEXT HOUSE
6643-67858-0028 WELL PUT ON YOUR THINGS AND RUN AFTER THEM THAT'S A GOOD GIRL SAID MISTER FULTON WHY HERE IS ESTRALLA NOW HE ADDED AS THE LITTLE COLORED GIRL APPEARED AT THE DOOR TELL MISS SYLVIA TO COME DOWN TO THE LANDING I'LL MEET YOU THERE
6643-67858-0029 AND HE HURRIED AWAY THINKING HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER WAS SAFE WITH MISSUS CARLETON
6643-67858-0030 IN A SUNNY CORNER OF THE VERANDA FOR THE LAST HOUR WHERE IS SYLVIA ECHOED MISSUS CARLETON WHO CAME IN AT THAT MOMENT HAS SHE GONE TO THE BOAT
6643-67858-0031 PERHAPS SHE HAS MISTER FULTON SAID FOR US TO COME RIGHT TO THE LANDING SAID GRACE HER THOUGHTS STILL FULL OF THE FAITHFUL SANCHO PANZA OF WHOM SHE HAD BEEN READING I WILL GO TO THE WHARF WITH YOU IT WAS TOO BAD TO LEAVE YOU
6643-67858-0032 I MUST SEE SYLVIA BEFORE SHE GOES PERHAPS I MAY NOT BE PERMITTED TO HAVE VISITORS MUCH LONGER SAID MISSUS CARLETON AND SHE AND GRACE LEFT THE PLEASANT ROOM AND FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY ESTRALLA MADE THEIR WAY OVER THE BRIDGE TO THE LANDING PLACE
6643-67858-0033 WHERE IS SYLVIA ASKED MISTER FULTON LOOKING AT HIS WATCH WE REALLY OUGHT TO HAVE STARTED AN HOUR AGO FOR A MOMENT THE LITTLE GROUP LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN SILENCE THEN WITH A SUDDEN CRY ESTRALLA DARTED OFF
6643-67858-0034 MISSUS CARLETON HURRIEDLY EXPLAINED SYLVIA'S STARTING OFF TO FIND ESTRALLA AND HER OWN DEPARTURE SHE BLAMED HERSELF THAT SHE HAD PERMITTED SYLVIA TO GO OUT ALONE SHE MUST BE SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE FORT DECLARED CAPTAIN CARLETON
6643-67858-0035 OH YES AGREED MISTER FULTON BUT WE HAD BEST LOSE NO TIME IN FINDING HER WHILE CAPTAIN CARLETON QUESTIONED THE SOLDIERS MISTER FULTON AND MISSUS CARLETON AND GRACE HASTENED BACK TO THE OFFICERS QUARTERS
6643-67858-0036 AND A THOROUGH SEARCH FOR THE LITTLE GIRL WAS BEGUN AT ONCE NO ONE GAVE A THOUGHT TO ESTRALLA
