593-126929-0000 WHO KNOWS HIS MANHOOD'S STRENGTH YET STILL HIS FEMALE FEEBLENESS MAINTAINS AS TO ONE CHANNEL FLOW THE MANY DRAINS ALL COME TO HIM YEA ALL BENEATH THE SKY THUS HE THE CONSTANT EXCELLENCE RETAINS
593-126929-0001 THE SIMPLE CHILD AGAIN FREE FROM ALL STAINS WHO KNOWS HOW WHITE ATTRACTS YET ALWAYS KEEPS HIMSELF WITHIN BLACK'S SHADE THE PATTERN OF HUMILITY DISPLAYED
593-126929-0002 DISPLAYED IN VIEW OF ALL BENEATH THE SKY HE IN THE UNCHANGING EXCELLENCE ARRAYED ENDLESS RETURN TO MAN'S FIRST STATE HAS MADE WHO KNOWS HOW GLORY SHINES YET LOVES DISGRACE
593-126929-0003 NOR E'ER FOR IT IS PALE BEHOLD HIS PRESENCE IN A SPACIOUS VALE TO WHICH MEN COME FROM ALL BENEATH THE SKY THE UNCHANGING EXCELLENCE COMPLETES ITS TALE THE SIMPLE INFANT MAN IN HIM WE HAIL
593-126929-0004 THE UNWROUGHT MATERIAL WHEN DIVIDED AND DISTRIBUTED FORMS VESSELS THE SAGE WHEN EMPLOYED BECOMES THE HEAD OF ALL THE OFFICERS OF GOVERNMENT AND IN HIS GREATEST REGULATIONS HE EMPLOYS NO VIOLENT MEASURES
593-126929-0005 IF ANY ONE SHOULD WISH TO GET THE KINGDOM FOR HIMSELF AND TO EFFECT THIS BY WHAT HE DOES I SEE THAT HE WILL NOT SUCCEED THE KINGDOM IS A SPIRIT LIKE THING AND CANNOT BE GOT BY ACTIVE DOING
593-126929-0006 HE WHO WOULD SO WIN IT DESTROYS IT HE WHO WOULD HOLD IT IN HIS GRASP LOSES IT
593-126929-0007 THE COURSE AND NATURE OF THINGS IS SUCH THAT WHAT WAS IN FRONT IS NOW BEHIND WHAT WARMED ANON WE FREEZING FIND STRENGTH IS OF WEAKNESS OFT THE SPOIL
593-126929-0008 THE STORE IN RUINS MOCKS OUR TOIL HENCE THE SAGE PUTS AWAY EXCESSIVE EFFORT EXTRAVAGANCE AND EASY INDULGENCE
593-126929-0009 HE WHO WOULD ASSIST A LORD OF MEN IN HARMONY WITH THE TAO WILL NOT ASSERT HIS MASTERY IN THE KINGDOM BY FORCE OF ARMS SUCH A COURSE IS SURE TO MEET WITH ITS PROPER RETURN
593-126929-0010 WHEREVER A HOST IS STATIONED BRIARS AND THORNS SPRING UP IN THE SEQUENCE OF GREAT ARMIES THERE ARE SURE TO BE BAD YEARS
593-126929-0011 A SKILFUL COMMANDER STRIKES A DECISIVE BLOW AND STOPS HE DOES NOT DARE BY CONTINUING HIS OPERATIONS TO ASSERT AND COMPLETE HIS MASTERY HE WILL STRIKE THE BLOW
593-126929-0012 BUT WILL BE ON HIS GUARD AGAINST BEING VAIN OR BOASTFUL OR ARROGANT IN CONSEQUENCE OF IT HE STRIKES IT AS A MATTER OF NECESSITY HE STRIKES IT BUT NOT FROM A WISH FOR MASTERY
593-126929-0013 WHEN THINGS HAVE ATTAINED THEIR STRONG MATURITY THEY BECOME OLD THIS MAY BE SAID TO BE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TAO AND WHAT IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH IT SOON COMES TO AN END
593-126929-0014 NOW ARMS HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL ARE INSTRUMENTS OF EVIL OMEN HATEFUL IT MAY BE SAID TO ALL CREATURES THEREFORE THEY WHO HAVE THE TAO DO NOT LIKE TO EMPLOY THEM
593-126929-0015 THE SUPERIOR MAN ORDINARILY CONSIDERS THE LEFT HAND THE MOST HONOURABLE PLACE BUT IN TIME OF WAR THE RIGHT HAND THOSE SHARP WEAPONS ARE INSTRUMENTS OF EVIL OMEN AND NOT THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE SUPERIOR MAN
593-126929-0016 HE USES THEM ONLY ON THE COMPULSION OF NECESSITY CALM AND REPOSE ARE WHAT HE PRIZES VICTORY BY FORCE OF ARMS IS TO HIM UNDESIRABLE TO CONSIDER THIS DESIRABLE
593-126929-0017 WOULD BE TO DELIGHT IN THE SLAUGHTER OF MEN AND HE WHO DELIGHTS IN THE SLAUGHTER OF MEN CANNOT GET HIS WILL IN THE KINGDOM
593-126929-0018 ON OCCASIONS OF FESTIVITY TO BE ON THE LEFT HAND IS THE PRIZED POSITION ON OCCASIONS OF MOURNING THE RIGHT HAND THE SECOND IN COMMAND OF THE ARMY HAS HIS PLACE ON THE LEFT THE GENERAL COMMANDING IN CHIEF HAS HIS ON THE RIGHT
593-126929-0019 HIS PLACE THAT IS IS ASSIGNED TO HIM AS IN THE RITES OF MOURNING HE WHO HAS KILLED MULTITUDES OF MEN SHOULD WEEP FOR THEM WITH THE BITTEREST GRIEF AND THE VICTOR IN BATTLE HAS HIS PLACE RIGHTLY ACCORDING TO THOSE RITES
593-126929-0020 THE TAO CONSIDERED AS UNCHANGING HAS NO NAME
593-126929-0021 THOUGH IN ITS PRIMORDIAL SIMPLICITY IT MAY BE SMALL THE WHOLE WORLD DARES NOT DEAL WITH ONE EMBODYING IT AS A MINISTER IF A FEUDAL PRINCE OR THE KING COULD GUARD AND HOLD IT
593-126929-0022 ALL WOULD SPONTANEOUSLY SUBMIT THEMSELVES TO HIM
593-126929-0023 HEAVEN AND EARTH UNDER ITS GUIDANCE UNITE TOGETHER AND SEND DOWN THE SWEET DEW WHICH WITHOUT THE DIRECTIONS OF MEN REACHES EQUALLY EVERYWHERE AS OF ITS OWN ACCORD
593-126929-0024 AS SOON AS IT PROCEEDS TO ACTION IT HAS A NAME WHEN IT ONCE HAS THAT NAME MEN CAN KNOW TO REST IN IT WHEN THEY KNOW TO REST IN IT THEY CAN BE FREE FROM ALL RISK OF FAILURE AND ERROR
593-126929-0025 THE RELATION OF THE TAO TO ALL THE WORLD IS LIKE THAT OF THE GREAT RIVERS AND SEAS TO THE STREAMS FROM THE VALLEYS
593-126929-0026 HE WHO KNOWS OTHER MEN IS DISCERNING HE WHO KNOWS HIMSELF IS INTELLIGENT HE WHO OVERCOMES OTHERS IS STRONG HE WHO OVERCOMES HIMSELF IS MIGHTY HE WHO IS SATISFIED WITH HIS LOT IS RICH
593-126929-0027 HE WHO GOES ON ACTING WITH ENERGY HAS A FIRM WILL
593-126929-0028 HE WHO DOES NOT FAIL IN THE REQUIREMENTS OF HIS POSITION CONTINUES LONG HE WHO DIES AND YET DOES NOT PERISH HAS LONGEVITY
593-126929-0029 ALL PERVADING IS THE GREAT TAO IT MAY BE FOUND ON THE LEFT HAND AND ON THE RIGHT
593-126929-0030 ALL THINGS DEPEND ON IT FOR THEIR PRODUCTION WHICH IT GIVES TO THEM NOT ONE REFUSING OBEDIENCE TO IT WHEN ITS WORK IS ACCOMPLISHED IT DOES NOT CLAIM THE NAME OF HAVING DONE IT IT CLOTHES ALL THINGS AS WITH A GARMENT
593-126929-0031 AND MAKES NO ASSUMPTION OF BEING THEIR LORD IT MAY BE NAMED IN THE SMALLEST THINGS ALL THINGS RETURN TO THEIR ROOT AND DISAPPEAR AND DO NOT KNOW THAT IT IS IT WHICH PRESIDES OVER THEIR DOING SO IT MAY BE NAMED IN THE GREATEST THINGS
593-126929-0032 HENCE THE SAGE IS ABLE IN THE SAME WAY TO ACCOMPLISH HIS GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS IT IS THROUGH HIS NOT MAKING HIMSELF GREAT THAT HE CAN ACCOMPLISH THEM
593-126929-0033 TO HIM WHO HOLDS IN HIS HANDS THE GREAT IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE TAO THE WHOLE WORLD REPAIRS MEN RESORT TO HIM AND RECEIVE NO HURT BUT FIND REST PEACE AND THE FEELING OF EASE
593-126929-0034 MUSIC AND DAINTIES WILL MAKE THE PASSING GUEST STOP FOR A TIME BUT THOUGH THE TAO AS IT COMES FROM THE MOUTH SEEMS INSIPID AND HAS NO FLAVOUR THOUGH IT SEEMS NOT WORTH BEING LOOKED AT OR LISTENED TO
593-126929-0035 THE USE OF IT IS INEXHAUSTIBLE
593-126929-0036 WHEN ONE IS ABOUT TO TAKE AN INSPIRATION HE IS SURE TO MAKE A PREVIOUS EXPIRATION WHEN HE IS GOING TO WEAKEN ANOTHER HE WILL FIRST STRENGTHEN HIM WHEN HE IS GOING TO OVERTHROW ANOTHER HE WILL FIRST HAVE RAISED HIM UP
593-126929-0037 WHEN HE IS GOING TO DESPOIL ANOTHER HE WILL FIRST HAVE MADE GIFTS TO HIM THIS IS CALLED HIDING THE LIGHT OF HIS PROCEDURE
593-126929-0038 THE SOFT OVERCOMES THE HARD AND THE WEAK THE STRONG
593-126929-0039 FISHES SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN FROM THE DEEP INSTRUMENTS FOR THE PROFIT OF A STATE SHOULD NOT BE SHOWN TO THE PEOPLE
593-126929-0040 THE TAO IN ITS REGULAR COURSE DOES NOTHING FOR THE SAKE OF DOING IT AND SO THERE IS NOTHING WHICH IT DOES NOT DO
593-126929-0041 IF PRINCES AND KINGS WERE ABLE TO MAINTAIN IT ALL THINGS WOULD OF THEMSELVES BE TRANSFORMED BY THEM
593-126929-0042 IF THIS TRANSFORMATION BECAME TO ME AN OBJECT OF DESIRE I WOULD EXPRESS THE DESIRE BY THE NAMELESS SIMPLICITY SIMPLICITY WITHOUT A NAME IS FREE FROM ALL EXTERNAL AIM
