4327-9959-0000 WHEN THENARDIER HAD RECOVERED HIS BREATH
4327-9959-0001 AND SAID TO HIM IN A LOW CURT VOICE WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY BEFORE WE PUT THE HANDCUFFS ON YOU
4327-9959-0002 IN THE MIDST OF THIS SILENCE A CRACKED VOICE LAUNCHED THIS LUGUBRIOUS SARCASM FROM THE CORRIDOR IF THERE'S ANY WOOD TO BE SPLIT I'M THERE IT WAS THE MAN WITH THE AXE WHO WAS GROWING MERRY
4327-9959-0003 AT THE SAME MOMENT AN ENORMOUS BRISTLING AND CLAYEY FACE MADE ITS APPEARANCE AT THE DOOR WITH A HIDEOUS LAUGH WHICH EXHIBITED NOT TEETH BUT FANGS IT WAS THE FACE OF THE MAN WITH THE BUTCHER'S AXE
4327-9959-0004 WHY HAVE YOU TAKEN OFF YOUR MASK CRIED THENARDIER IN A RAGE FOR FUN RETORTED THE MAN
4327-9959-0005 WHO BLINDED AND DAZZLED BY HIS OWN RAGE WAS STALKING TO AND FRO IN THE DEN WITH FULL CONFIDENCE THAT THE DOOR WAS GUARDED AND OF HOLDING AN UNARMED MAN FAST HE BEING ARMED HIMSELF
4327-9959-0006 OF BEING NINE AGAINST ONE SUPPOSING THAT THE FEMALE THENARDIER COUNTED FOR BUT ONE MAN
4327-9959-0007 OVERTURNED THE CHAIR WITH HIS FOOT AND THE TABLE WITH HIS FIST AND WITH ONE BOUND WITH PRODIGIOUS AGILITY BEFORE THENARDIER HAD TIME TO TURN ROUND HE HAD REACHED THE WINDOW TO OPEN IT TO SCALE THE FRAME TO BESTRIDE IT WAS THE WORK OF A SECOND ONLY
4327-9959-0008 HE WAS HALF OUT WHEN SIX ROBUST FISTS SEIZED HIM AND DRAGGED HIM BACK ENERGETICALLY INTO THE HOVEL THESE WERE THE THREE CHIMNEY BUILDERS WHO HAD FLUNG THEMSELVES UPON HIM AT THE SAME TIME THE THENARDIER WOMAN HAD WOUND HER HANDS IN HIS HAIR
4327-9959-0009 AT THE TRAMPLING WHICH ENSUED THE OTHER RUFFIANS RUSHED UP FROM THE CORRIDOR THE OLD MAN ON THE BED WHO SEEMED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF WINE DESCENDED FROM THE PALLET AND CAME REELING UP WITH A STONE BREAKER'S HAMMER IN HIS HAND
4327-9959-0010 ONE OF THE CHIMNEY BUILDERS WHOSE SMIRCHED FACE WAS LIGHTED UP BY THE CANDLE AND IN WHOM MARIUS RECOGNIZED IN SPITE OF HIS DAUBING PANCHAUD ALIAS PRINTANIER ALIAS BIGRENAILLE
4327-9959-0011 MARIUS COULD NOT RESIST THIS SIGHT MY FATHER HE THOUGHT
4327-9959-0012 THE SHOT WAS ON THE POINT OF BEING DISCHARGED WHEN THENARDIER'S VOICE SHOUTED DON'T HARM HIM THIS DESPERATE ATTEMPT OF THE VICTIM FAR FROM EXASPERATING THENARDIER HAD CALMED HIM THERE EXISTED IN HIM TWO MEN
4327-9959-0013 THE FEROCIOUS MAN AND THE ADROIT MAN UP TO THAT MOMENT IN THE EXCESS OF HIS TRIUMPH IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PREY WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT DOWN AND WHICH DID NOT STIR THE FEROCIOUS MAN HAD PREVAILED WHEN THE VICTIM STRUGGLED AND TRIED TO RESIST
4327-9959-0014 THE ADROIT MAN REAPPEARED AND TOOK THE UPPER HAND DON'T HURT HIM HE REPEATED AND WITHOUT SUSPECTING IT HIS FIRST SUCCESS WAS TO ARREST THE PISTOL IN THE ACT OF BEING DISCHARGED AND TO PARALYZE MARIUS IN WHOSE OPINION THE URGENCY OF THE CASE DISAPPEARED
4327-9959-0015 AND WHO IN THE FACE OF THIS NEW PHASE SAW NO INCONVENIENCE IN WAITING A WHILE LONGER WHO KNOWS WHETHER SOME CHANCE WOULD NOT ARISE WHICH WOULD DELIVER HIM FROM THE HORRIBLE ALTERNATIVE OF ALLOWING URSULE'S FATHER TO PERISH OR OF DESTROYING THE COLONEL'S SAVIOUR
4327-9959-0016 ROLLING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM THEN WITH TWO BACKWARD SWEEPS OF HIS HAND HE HAD OVERTHROWN TWO MORE ASSAILANTS AND HE HELD ONE UNDER EACH OF HIS KNEES THE WRETCHES WERE RATTLING IN THE THROAT BENEATH THIS PRESSURE AS UNDER A GRANITE MILLSTONE
4327-9959-0017 BUT THE OTHER FOUR HAD SEIZED THE FORMIDABLE OLD MAN BY BOTH ARMS AND THE BACK OF HIS NECK AND WERE HOLDING HIM DOUBLED UP OVER THE TWO CHIMNEY BUILDERS ON THE FLOOR THUS THE MASTER OF SOME AND MASTERED BY THE REST
4327-9959-0018 CRUSHING THOSE BENEATH HIM AND STIFLING UNDER THOSE ON TOP OF HIM ENDEAVORING IN VAIN TO SHAKE OFF ALL THE EFFORTS WHICH WERE HEAPED UPON HIM
4327-9959-0019 DON'T YOU MIX YOURSELF UP IN THIS AFFAIR SAID THENARDIER YOU'LL TEAR YOUR SHAWL THE THENARDIER OBEYED AS THE FEMALE WOLF OBEYS THE MALE WOLF WITH A GROWL NOW SAID THENARDIER SEARCH HIM YOU OTHER FELLOWS
4327-9959-0020 THEY SEARCHED HIM HE HAD NOTHING ON HIS PERSON EXCEPT A LEATHER PURSE CONTAINING SIX FRANCS AND HIS HANDKERCHIEF THENARDIER PUT THE HANDKERCHIEF INTO HIS OWN POCKET WHAT NO POCKET BOOK HE DEMANDED NO NOR WATCH
4327-9959-0021 REPLIED ONE OF THE CHIMNEY BUILDERS NEVER MIND MURMURED THE MASKED MAN WHO CARRIED THE BIG KEY IN THE VOICE OF A VENTRILOQUIST HE'S A TOUGH OLD FELLOW THENARDIER WENT TO THE CORNER NEAR THE DOOR PICKED UP A BUNDLE OF ROPES AND THREW THEM AT THE MEN
4327-9959-0022 TIE HIM TO THE LEG OF THE BED SAID HE
4327-9959-0023 AND WHO MADE NO MOVEMENT HE ADDED IS BOULATRUELLE DEAD
4327-9959-0024 WHY DID YOU BRING SO MANY THEY WERE NOT NEEDED WHAT CAN YOU DO REPLIED THE MAN WITH THE CUDGEL THEY ALL WANTED TO BE IN IT THIS IS A BAD SEASON
4327-9959-0025 ELEVATED ON FOUR COARSE WOODEN LEGS ROUGHLY HEWN
4327-9959-0026 THE RUFFIANS BOUND HIM SECURELY IN AN UPRIGHT ATTITUDE WITH HIS FEET ON THE GROUND AT THE HEAD OF THE BED THE END WHICH WAS MOST REMOTE FROM THE WINDOW AND NEAREST TO THE FIREPLACE WHEN THE LAST KNOT HAD BEEN TIED
4327-9959-0027 IN THE COURSE OF A FEW MOMENTS HIS FACE HAD PASSED FROM UNBRIDLED VIOLENCE TO TRANQUIL AND CUNNING SWEETNESS
4327-9959-0028 THE ALMOST BESTIAL MOUTH WHICH HAD BEEN FOAMING BUT A MOMENT BEFORE HE GAZED WITH AMAZEMENT ON THAT FANTASTIC AND ALARMING METAMORPHOSIS AND HE FELT AS A MAN MIGHT FEEL WHO SHOULD BEHOLD A TIGER CONVERTED INTO A LAWYER MONSIEUR SAID THENARDIER
4327-9959-0029 STAND OFF A LITTLE AND LET ME HAVE A TALK WITH THE GENTLEMAN ALL RETIRED TOWARDS THE DOOR HE WENT ON MONSIEUR YOU DID WRONG TO TRY TO JUMP OUT OF THE WINDOW YOU MIGHT HAVE BROKEN YOUR LEG NOW IF YOU WILL PERMIT ME WE WILL CONVERSE QUIETLY
4327-9959-0030 IN THE FIRST PLACE I MUST COMMUNICATE TO YOU AN OBSERVATION WHICH I HAVE MADE WHICH IS THAT YOU HAVE NOT UTTERED THE FAINTEST CRY THENARDIER WAS RIGHT THIS DETAIL WAS CORRECT ALTHOUGH IT HAD ESCAPED MARIUS IN HIS AGITATION
4327-9959-0031 AND EVEN DURING HIS STRUGGLE WITH THE SIX RUFFIANS NEAR THE WINDOW HE HAD PRESERVED THE MOST PROFOUND AND SINGULAR SILENCE THENARDIER CONTINUED MON DIEU YOU MIGHT HAVE SHOUTED STOP THIEF A BIT AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT IT IMPROPER MURDER
4327-9959-0032 THAT TOO IS SAID OCCASIONALLY AND SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED
4327-9959-0033 YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE THAT AND NO ONE WOULD HAVE TROUBLED YOU ON THAT ACCOUNT YOU WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE BEEN GAGGED AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY THIS ROOM IS VERY PRIVATE THAT'S ITS ONLY RECOMMENDATION BUT IT HAS THAT IN ITS FAVOR
4327-9959-0034 YOU MIGHT FIRE OFF A MORTAR AND IT WOULD PRODUCE ABOUT AS MUCH NOISE AT THE NEAREST POLICE STATION AS THE SNORES OF A DRUNKEN MAN HERE A CANNON WOULD MAKE A BOUM AND THE THUNDER WOULD MAKE A POUF IT'S A HANDY LODGING
4327-9959-0035 JUSTICE WELL YOU HAVE NOT MADE AN OUTCRY THAT IS BECAUSE YOU DON'T CARE TO HAVE THE POLICE AND THE COURTS COME IN ANY MORE THAN WE DO IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE LONG SUSPECTED IT
