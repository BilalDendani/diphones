5405-121045-0000 HE STRETCHED FORTH HIS HAND AND TOUCHED STONE HE ROSE TO HIS SEAT AND FOUND HIMSELF LYING ON HIS BOURNOUS IN A BED OF DRY HEATHER VERY SOFT AND ODORIFEROUS
5405-121045-0001 HE FOUND THAT HE WAS IN A GROTTO WENT TOWARDS THE OPENING AND THROUGH A KIND OF FANLIGHT SAW A BLUE SEA
5405-121045-0002 THE AIR AND WATER WERE SHINING IN THE BEAMS OF THE MORNING SUN ON THE SHORE THE SAILORS WERE SITTING CHATTING AND LAUGHING AND AT TEN YARDS FROM THEM THE BOAT WAS AT ANCHOR UNDULATING GRACEFULLY ON THE WATER THERE FOR SOME TIME HE ENJOYED THE FRESH BREEZE WHICH PLAYED ON HIS BROW
5405-121045-0003 AND LISTENED TO THE DASH OF THE WAVES ON THE BEACH THAT LEFT AGAINST THE ROCKS A LACE OF FOAM AS WHITE AS SILVER HE WAS FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT REFLECTION OR THOUGHT FOR THE DIVINE CHARM WHICH IS IN THE THINGS OF NATURE
5405-121045-0004 THEN GRADUALLY THIS VIEW OF THE OUTER WORLD SO CALM SO PURE SO GRAND REMINDED HIM OF THE ILLUSIVENESS OF HIS VISION AND ONCE MORE AWAKENED MEMORY HE RECALLED HIS ARRIVAL ON THE ISLAND HIS PRESENTATION TO A SMUGGLER CHIEF
5405-121045-0005 A SUBTERRANEAN PALACE FULL OF SPLENDOR AN EXCELLENT SUPPER AND A SPOONFUL OF HASHISH IT SEEMED HOWEVER EVEN IN THE VERY FACE OF OPEN DAY
5405-121045-0006 SO DEEP WAS THE IMPRESSION MADE IN HIS MIND BY THE DREAM AND SO STRONG A HOLD HAD IT TAKEN OF HIS IMAGINATION THUS EVERY NOW AND THEN HE SAW IN FANCY AMID THE SAILORS SEATED ON A ROCK OR UNDULATING IN THE VESSEL
5405-121045-0007 ONE OF THE SHADOWS WHICH HAD SHARED HIS DREAM WITH LOOKS AND KISSES OTHERWISE HIS HEAD WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR AND HIS BODY REFRESHED HE WAS FREE FROM THE SLIGHTEST HEADACHE ON THE CONTRARY HE FELT A CERTAIN DEGREE OF LIGHTNESS A FACULTY FOR ABSORBING THE PURE AIR
5405-121045-0008 AND ENJOYING THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE MORE VIVIDLY THAN EVER HE WENT GAYLY UP TO THE SAILORS WHO ROSE AS SOON AS THEY PERCEIVED HIM AND THE PATRON ACCOSTING HIM SAID
5405-121045-0009 THIS IS THEN ALL REALITY THERE EXISTS A MAN WHO HAS RECEIVED ME IN THIS ISLAND ENTERTAINED ME RIGHT ROYALLY AND HIS DEPARTED WHILE I WAS ASLEEP HE EXISTS AS CERTAINLY
5405-121045-0010 AND IF YOU WILL USE YOUR GLASS YOU WILL IN ALL PROBABILITY RECOGNIZE YOUR HOST IN THE MIDST OF HIS CREW SO SAYING GAETANO POINTED IN A DIRECTION IN WHICH A SMALL VESSEL WAS MAKING SAIL TOWARDS THE SOUTHERN POINT OF CORSICA
5405-121045-0011 FRANZ ADJUSTED HIS TELESCOPE AND DIRECTED IT TOWARDS THE YACHT GAETANO WAS NOT MISTAKEN AT THE STERN THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER WAS STANDING UP LOOKING TOWARDS THE SHORE AND HOLDING A SPY GLASS IN HIS HAND HE WAS ATTIRED AS HE HAD BEEN ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING
5405-121045-0012 AND WAVED HIS POCKET HANDKERCHIEF TO HIS GUEST IN TOKEN OF ADIEU FRANZ RETURNED THE SALUTE BY SHAKING HIS HANDKERCHIEF AS AN EXCHANGE OF SIGNALS AFTER A SECOND A SLIGHT CLOUD OF SMOKE WAS SEEN AT THE STERN OF THE VESSEL
5405-121045-0013 WHICH ROSE GRACEFULLY AS IT EXPANDED IN THE AIR AND THEN FRANZ HEARD A SLIGHT REPORT THERE DO YOU HEAR OBSERVED GAETANO
5405-121045-0014 THE YOUNG MAN TOOK HIS CARBINE AND FIRED IT IN THE AIR BUT WITHOUT ANY IDEA THAT THE NOISE COULD BE HEARD AT THE DISTANCE WHICH SEPARATED THE YACHT FROM THE SHORE WHAT ARE YOUR EXCELLENCY'S ORDERS INQUIRED GAETANO IN THE FIRST PLACE LIGHT ME A TORCH
5405-121045-0015 AH YES I UNDERSTAND REPLIED THE PATRON TO FIND THE ENTRANCE TO THE ENCHANTED APARTMENT WITH MUCH PLEASURE YOUR EXCELLENCY IF IT WOULD AMUSE YOU AND I WILL GET YOU THE TORCH YOU ASK FOR
5405-121045-0016 BUT I TOO HAVE HAD THE IDEA YOU HAVE AND TWO OR THREE TIMES THE SAME FANCY HAS COME OVER ME BUT I HAVE ALWAYS GIVEN IT UP GIOVANNI LIGHT A TORCH HE ADDED AND GIVE IT TO HIS EXCELLENCY GIOVANNI OBEYED
5405-121045-0017 FRANZ TOOK THE LAMP AND ENTERED THE SUBTERRANEAN GROTTO FOLLOWED BY GAETANO
5405-121045-0018 BUT IT WAS IN VAIN THAT HE CARRIED HIS TORCH ALL ROUND THE EXTERIOR SURFACE OF THE GROTTO
5405-121045-0019 OTHERS HAD BEFORE HIM ATTEMPTED THE SAME THING AND LIKE HIM IN VAIN YET HE DID NOT LEAVE A FOOT OF THIS GRANITE WALL AS IMPENETRABLE AS FUTURITY WITHOUT STRICT SCRUTINY HE DID NOT SEE A FISSURE WITHOUT INTRODUCING THE BLADE OF HIS HUNTING SWORD INTO IT
5405-121045-0020 OR A PROJECTING POINT ON WHICH HE DID NOT LEAN
5405-121045-0021 WHICH WERE AT LAST UTTERLY USELESS AT THE END OF THIS TIME HE GAVE UP HIS SEARCH AND GAETANO SMILED WHEN FRANZ APPEARED AGAIN ON THE SHORE THE YACHT ONLY SEEMED LIKE A SMALL WHITE SPECK ON THE HORIZON HE LOOKED AGAIN THROUGH HIS GLASS BUT EVEN THEN HE COULD NOT DISTINGUISH ANYTHING
5405-121045-0022 GAETANO REMINDED HIM THAT HE HAD COME FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHOOTING GOATS WHICH HE HAD UTTERLY FORGOTTEN HE TOOK HIS FOWLING PIECE AND BEGAN TO HUNT OVER THE ISLAND WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO IS FULFILLING A DUTY RATHER THAN ENJOYING A PLEASURE
5405-121045-0023 AND AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HE HAD KILLED A GOAT AND TWO KIDS THESE ANIMALS THOUGH WILD AND AGILE AS CHAMOIS WERE TOO MUCH LIKE DOMESTIC GOATS AND FRANZ COULD NOT CONSIDER THEM AS GAME MOREOVER OTHER IDEAS MUCH MORE ENTHRALLING OCCUPIED HIS MIND
5405-121045-0024 THE SECOND VISIT WAS A LONG ONE AND WHEN HE RETURNED THE KID WAS ROASTED AND THE REPAST READY FRANZ WAS SITTING ON THE SPOT WHERE HE WAS ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING WHEN HIS MYSTERIOUS HOST HAD INVITED HIM TO SUPPER
5405-121045-0025 AND HE SAW THE LITTLE YACHT NOW LIKE A SEA GULL ON THE WAVE CONTINUING HER FLIGHT TOWARDS CORSICA WHY HE REMARKED TO GAETANO YOU TOLD ME THAT SIGNOR SINBAD WAS GOING TO MALAGA WHILE IT SEEMS HE IS IN THE DIRECTION OF PORTO VECCHIO
5405-121045-0026 DON'T YOU REMEMBER SAID THE PATRON I TOLD YOU THAT AMONG THE CREW THERE WERE TWO CORSICAN BRIGANDS TRUE AND HE IS GOING TO LAND THEM ADDED FRANZ PRECISELY SO REPLIED GAETANO AH HE IS ONE WHO FEARS NEITHER GOD NOR SATAN THEY SAY
5405-121045-0027 OR ANY AUTHORITIES HE SMILES AT THEM LET THEM TRY TO PURSUE HIM WHY IN THE FIRST PLACE HIS YACHT IS NOT A SHIP BUT A BIRD AND HE WOULD BEAT ANY FRIGATE THREE KNOTS IN EVERY NINE AND IF HE WERE TO THROW HIMSELF ON THE COAST WHY IS HE NOT CERTAIN OF FINDING FRIENDS EVERYWHERE
5405-121045-0028 HAD THE HONOR OF BEING ON EXCELLENT TERMS WITH THE SMUGGLERS AND BANDITS ALONG THE WHOLE COAST OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND SO ENJOYED EXCEPTIONAL PRIVILEGES AS TO FRANZ HE HAD NO LONGER ANY INDUCEMENT TO REMAIN AT MONTE CRISTO
5405-121045-0029 AS IT DISAPPEARED IN THE GULF OF PORTO VECCHIO WITH IT WAS EFFACED THE LAST TRACE OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT AND THEN SUPPER SINBAD HASHISH STATUES ALL BECAME A DREAM FOR FRANZ
5405-121045-0030 THEY HAD LOST SIGHT OF MONTE CRISTO WHEN FRANZ HAD ONCE AGAIN SET FOOT ON SHORE HE FORGOT FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST THE EVENTS WHICH HAD JUST PASSED WHILE HE FINISHED HIS AFFAIRS OF PLEASURE AT FLORENCE
5405-121045-0031 WHO WAS AWAITING HIM AT ROME HE SET OUT AND ON THE SATURDAY EVENING REACHED THE ETERNAL CITY BY THE MAIL COACH AN APARTMENT AS WE HAVE SAID HAD BEEN RETAINED BEFOREHAND AND THUS HE HAD BUT TO GO TO SIGNOR PASTRINI'S HOTEL
5405-121045-0032 BUT THIS WAS NOT SO EASY A MATTER FOR THE STREETS WERE THRONGED WITH PEOPLE AND ROME WAS ALREADY A PREY TO THAT LOW AND FEVERISH MURMUR WHICH PRECEDES ALL GREAT EVENTS AND AT ROME THERE ARE FOUR GREAT EVENTS IN EVERY YEAR
5405-121045-0033 THE CARNIVAL HOLY WEEK CORPUS CHRISTI AND THE FEAST OF SAINT PETER ALL THE REST OF THE YEAR THE CITY IS IN THAT STATE OF DULL APATHY BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH WHICH RENDERS IT SIMILAR TO A KIND OF STATION BETWEEN THIS WORLD AND THE NEXT
5405-121045-0034 A SUBLIME SPOT A RESTING PLACE FULL OF POETRY AND CHARACTER AND AT WHICH FRANZ HAD ALREADY HALTED FIVE OR SIX TIMES AND AT EACH TIME FOUND IT MORE MARVELLOUS AND STRIKING
5405-121045-0035 AND REACHED THE HOTEL ON HIS FIRST INQUIRY HE WAS TOLD
5405-121045-0036 THIS PLAN SUCCEEDED AND SIGNOR PASTRINI HIMSELF RAN TO HIM EXCUSING HIMSELF FOR HAVING MADE HIS EXCELLENCY WAIT SCOLDING THE WAITERS TAKING THE CANDLESTICK FROM THE PORTER
5405-121045-0037 WHEN MORCERF HIMSELF APPEARED THE APARTMENT CONSISTED OF TWO SMALL ROOMS AND A PARLOR THE TWO ROOMS LOOKED ONTO THE STREET A FACT WHICH SIGNOR PASTRINI COMMENTED UPON AS AN INAPPRECIABLE ADVANTAGE
5405-121045-0038 WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SICILIAN OR MALTESE BUT THE HOST WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE TO WHICH OF THE TWO NATIONS THE TRAVELLER BELONGED VERY GOOD SIGNOR PASTRINI SAID FRANZ BUT WE MUST HAVE SOME SUPPER INSTANTLY AND A CARRIAGE FOR TOMORROW AND THE FOLLOWING DAYS
5405-121045-0039 YOU SHALL BE SERVED IMMEDIATELY BUT AS FOR THE CARRIAGE WHAT AS TO THE CARRIAGE EXCLAIMED ALBERT COME COME SIGNOR PASTRINI NO JOKING WE MUST HAVE A CARRIAGE SIR REPLIED THE HOST WE WILL DO ALL IN OUR POWER TO PROCURE YOU ONE THIS IS ALL I CAN SAY
5405-121045-0040 AND WHEN SHALL WE KNOW INQUIRED FRANZ TO MORROW MORNING ANSWERED THE INN KEEPER OH THE DEUCE THEN WE SHALL PAY THE MORE THAT'S ALL I SEE PLAINLY ENOUGH
5405-121045-0041 I AM AFRAID IF WE OFFER THEM DOUBLE THAT WE SHALL NOT PROCURE A CARRIAGE THEN THEY MUST PUT HORSES TO MINE
5405-121045-0042 THERE ARE NO HORSES ALBERT LOOKED AT FRANZ LIKE A MAN WHO HEARS A REPLY HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT MY DEAR FRANZ NO HORSES HE SAID BUT CAN'T WE HAVE POST HORSES
5405-121045-0043 THEY HAVE BEEN ALL HIRED THIS FORTNIGHT AND THERE ARE NONE LEFT BUT THOSE ABSOLUTELY REQUISITE FOR POSTING WHAT ARE WE TO SAY TO THIS ASKED FRANZ I SAY THAT WHEN A THING COMPLETELY SURPASSES MY COMPREHENSION I AM ACCUSTOMED NOT TO DWELL ON THAT THING BUT TO PASS TO ANOTHER
5405-121045-0044 IS SUPPER READY SIGNOR PASTRINI YES YOUR EXCELLENCY
