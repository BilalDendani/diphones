8643-298549-0000 THE LORD OF CHATEAU NOIR IT WAS IN THE DAYS WHEN THE GERMAN ARMIES HAD BROKEN THEIR WAY ACROSS FRANCE AND WHEN THE SHATTERED FORCES OF THE YOUNG REPUBLIC HAD BEEN SWEPT AWAY
8643-298549-0001 AND TO THE SOUTH OF THE LOIRE THREE BROAD STREAMS OF ARMED MEN HAD ROLLED SLOWLY BUT IRRESISTIBLY FROM THE RHINE NOW MEANDERING TO THE NORTH NOW TO THE SOUTH DIVIDING COALESCING
8643-298549-0002 AND FROM THIS LAKE THERE WELLED OUT SMALLER STREAMS ONE TO THE NORTH ONE SOUTHWARD TO ORLEANS AND A THIRD WESTWARD TO NORMANDY
8643-298549-0003 BLACK AND BITTER WERE THE THOUGHTS OF FRENCHMEN WHEN THEY SAW THIS WEAL OF DISHONOUR SLASHED ACROSS THE FAIR FACE OF THEIR COUNTRY THEY HAD FOUGHT AND THEY HAD BEEN OVERBORNE
8643-298549-0004 THOSE COUNTLESS FOOTMEN THE MASTERFUL GUNS THEY HAD TRIED AND TRIED TO MAKE HEAD AGAINST THEM IN BATTALIONS THEIR INVADERS WERE NOT TO BE BEATEN BUT MAN TO MAN OR TEN TO TEN THEY WERE THEIR EQUALS
8643-298549-0005 A BRAVE FRENCHMAN MIGHT STILL MAKE A SINGLE GERMAN RUE THE DAY THAT HE HAD LEFT HIS OWN BANK OF THE RHINE THUS UNCHRONICLED AMID THE BATTLES AND THE SIEGES THERE BROKE OUT ANOTHER WAR A WAR OF INDIVIDUALS
8643-298549-0006 WITH FOUL MURDER UPON THE ONE SIDE AND BRUTAL REPRISAL ON THE OTHER
8643-298549-0007 OF THE TWENTY FOURTH POSEN INFANTRY HAD SUFFERED SEVERELY DURING THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT HE COMMANDED IN THE LITTLE NORMAN TOWN OF LES ANDELYS AND HIS OUTPOSTS STRETCHED AMID THE HAMLETS AND FARMHOUSES
8643-298549-0008 OF THE DISTRICT ROUND NO FRENCH FORCE WAS WITHIN FIFTY MILES OF HIM AND YET MORNING AFTER MORNING HE HAD TO LISTEN TO A BLACK REPORT OF SENTRIES FOUND DEAD AT THEIR POSTS OR OF FORAGING PARTIES WHICH HAD NEVER RETURNED
8643-298549-0009 THEN THE COLONEL WOULD GO FORTH IN HIS WRATH AND FARMSTEADINGS WOULD BLAZE AND VILLAGES TREMBLE BUT NEXT MORNING THERE WAS STILL THAT SAME DISMAL TALE TO BE TOLD DO WHAT HE MIGHT HE COULD NOT SHAKE OFF HIS INVISIBLE ENEMIES
8643-298549-0010 AND YET IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO HARD FOR FROM CERTAIN SIGNS IN COMMON IN THE PLAN AND IN THE DEED IT WAS CERTAIN THAT ALL THESE OUTRAGES CAME FROM A SINGLE SOURCE
8643-298549-0011 GOLD MIGHT BE MORE SUCCESSFUL HE PUBLISHED IT ABROAD
8643-298549-0012 THE PEASANTS WERE INCORRUPTIBLE THEN GOADED ON BY A MURDERED CORPORAL HE ROSE TO A THOUSAND
8643-298549-0013 WAS A STRONGER PASSION THAN HIS FRENCH HATRED YOU SAY THAT YOU KNOW WHO DID THESE CRIMES ASKED THE PRUSSIAN COLONEL EYEING WITH LOATHING THE BLUE BLOUSED RAT FACED CREATURE BEFORE HIM YES COLONEL
8643-298549-0014 AND IT WAS THOSE THOUSAND FRANCS COLONEL NOT A SOU UNTIL YOUR STORY HAS BEEN TESTED COME WHO IS IT WHO HAS MURDERED MY MEN IT IS COUNT EUSTACE OF CHATEAU NOIR
8643-298549-0015 YOU LIE CRIED THE COLONEL ANGRILY A GENTLEMAN AND A NOBLEMAN COULD NOT HAVE DONE SUCH CRIMES THE PEASANT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IT IS EVIDENT TO ME THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW THE COUNT IT IS THIS WAY COLONEL
8643-298549-0016 WHAT I TELL YOU IS THE TRUTH AND I AM NOT AFRAID THAT YOU SHOULD TEST IT THE COUNT OF CHATEAU NOIR IS A HARD MAN EVEN AT THE BEST TIME HE WAS A HARD MAN BUT OF LATE HE HAS BEEN TERRIBLE IT WAS HIS SON'S DEATH YOU KNOW
8643-298549-0017 HIS SON WAS UNDER DOUAY AND HE WAS TAKEN AND THEN IN ESCAPING FROM GERMANY HE MET HIS DEATH IT WAS THE COUNT'S ONLY CHILD AND INDEED WE ALL THINK THAT IT HAS DRIVEN HIM MAD
8643-298549-0018 WITH HIS PEASANTS HE FOLLOWS THE GERMAN ARMIES I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY HE HAS KILLED BUT IT IS HE WHO CUT THE CROSS UPON THE FOREHEADS FOR IT IS THE BADGE OF HIS HOUSE IT WAS TRUE
8643-298549-0019 THE MURDERED SENTRIES HAD EACH HAD A SALTIRE CROSS SLASHED ACROSS THEIR BROWS AS BY A HUNTING KNIFE THE COLONEL BENT HIS STIFF BACK AND RAN HIS FOREFINGER OVER THE MAP WHICH LAY UPON THE TABLE
8643-298549-0020 THE CHATEAU NOIR IS NOT MORE THAN FOUR LEAGUES HE SAID THREE AND A KILOMETRE COLONEL YOU KNOW THE PLACE I USED TO WORK THERE
8643-298549-0021 GIVE THIS MAN FOOD AND DETAIN HIM SAID HE TO THE SERGEANT WHY DETAIN ME COLONEL I CAN TELL YOU NO MORE WE SHALL NEED YOU AS GUIDE AS GUIDE BUT THE COUNT IF I WERE TO FALL INTO HIS HANDS
8643-298549-0022 AH COLONEL THE PRUSSIAN COMMANDER WAVED HIM AWAY SEND CAPTAIN BAUMGARTEN TO ME AT ONCE SAID HE
8643-298549-0023 AS A SOLDIER HE WAS SLOW BUT RELIABLE AND BRAVE THE COLONEL COULD TRUST HIM WHERE A MORE DASHING OFFICER MIGHT BE IN DANGER YOU WILL PROCEED TO CHATEAU NOIR TO NIGHT CAPTAIN SAID HE A GUIDE HAS BEEN PROVIDED
8643-298549-0024 YOU WILL ARREST THE COUNT AND BRING HIM BACK IF THERE IS AN ATTEMPT AT RESCUE SHOOT HIM AT ONCE HOW MANY MEN SHALL I TAKE COLONEL WELL WE ARE SURROUNDED BY SPIES AND OUR ONLY CHANCE IS TO POUNCE UPON HIM
8643-298549-0025 BEFORE HE KNOWS THAT WE ARE ON THE WAY A LARGE FORCE WILL ATTRACT ATTENTION ON THE OTHER HAND YOU MUST NOT RISK BEING CUT OFF I MIGHT MARCH NORTH COLONEL AS IF TO JOIN GENERAL GOEBEN
8643-298549-0026 IN THAT CASE WITH TWENTY MEN VERY GOOD CAPTAIN I HOPE TO SEE YOU WITH YOUR PRISONER TO MORROW MORNING IT WAS A COLD DECEMBER NIGHT WHEN CAPTAIN BAUMGARTEN MARCHED OUT OF LES ANDELYS WITH HIS TWENTY POSENERS
8643-298549-0027 AND TOOK THE MAIN ROAD TO THE NORTH WEST TWO MILES OUT HE TURNED SUDDENLY DOWN A NARROW DEEPLY RUTTED TRACK AND MADE SWIFTLY FOR HIS MAN A THIN COLD RAIN WAS FALLING
8643-298549-0028 SWISHING AMONG THE TALL POPLAR TREES AND RUSTLING IN THE FIELDS ON EITHER SIDE THE CAPTAIN WALKED FIRST WITH MOSER A VETERAN SERGEANT BESIDE HIM
8643-298549-0029 THE SERGEANT'S WRIST WAS FASTENED TO THAT OF THE FRENCH PEASANT AND IT HAD BEEN WHISPERED IN HIS EAR THAT IN CASE OF AN AMBUSH THE FIRST BULLET FIRED WOULD BE THROUGH HIS HEAD
8643-298549-0030 BEHIND THEM THE TWENTY INFANTRYMEN PLODDED ALONG THROUGH THE DARKNESS WITH THEIR FACES SUNK TO THE RAIN AND THEIR BOOTS SQUEAKING IN THE SOFT WET CLAY
8643-298549-0031 THEY KNEW WHERE THEY WERE GOING AND WHY AND THE THOUGHT UPHELD THEM FOR THEY WERE BITTER AT THE LOSS OF THEIR COMRADES IT WAS A CAVALRY JOB THEY KNEW
8643-298549-0032 THE WALL IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN THE OPENING HAD CRUMBLED AWAY BUT THE GREAT GATE STILL TOWERED ABOVE THE BRAMBLES AND WEEDS WHICH HAD OVERGROWN ITS BASE
8643-298549-0033 AT THE TOP THEY HALTED AND RECONNOITRED THE BLACK CHATEAU LAY IN FRONT OF THEM THE MOON HAD SHONE OUT BETWEEN TWO RAIN CLOUDS AND THREW THE OLD HOUSE INTO SILVER AND SHADOW
8643-298549-0034 IT WAS SHAPED LIKE AN L WITH A LOW ARCHED DOOR IN FRONT AND LINES OF SMALL WINDOWS LIKE THE OPEN PORTS OF A MAN OF WAR ABOVE WAS A DARK ROOF BREAKING AT THE CORNERS INTO LITTLE ROUND OVERHANGING TURRETS
8643-298549-0035 THE WHOLE LYING SILENT IN THE MOONSHINE WITH A DRIFT OF RAGGED CLOUDS BLACKENING THE HEAVENS BEHIND IT A SINGLE LIGHT GLEAMED IN ONE OF THE LOWER WINDOWS THE CAPTAIN WHISPERED HIS ORDERS TO HIS MEN
8643-298549-0036 SOME WERE TO CREEP TO THE FRONT DOOR SOME TO THE BACK SOME WERE TO WATCH THE EAST AND SOME THE WEST HE AND THE SERGEANT STOLE ON TIPTOE TO THE LIGHTED WINDOW
8643-298549-0037 IT WAS A SMALL ROOM INTO WHICH THEY LOOKED VERY MEANLY FURNISHED AN ELDERLY MAN IN THE DRESS OF A MENIAL WAS READING A TATTERED PAPER BY THE LIGHT OF A GUTTERING CANDLE
8643-298549-0038 HE LEANED BACK IN HIS WOODEN CHAIR WITH HIS FEET UPON A BOX WHILE A BOTTLE OF WHITE WINE STOOD WITH A HALF FILLED TUMBLER UPON A STOOL BESIDE HIM
8643-298549-0039 THE SERGEANT THRUST HIS NEEDLE GUN THROUGH THE GLASS AND THE MAN SPRANG TO HIS FEET WITH A SHRIEK SILENCE FOR YOUR LIFE THE HOUSE IS SURROUNDED AND YOU CANNOT ESCAPE COME ROUND AND OPEN THE DOOR OR WE WILL SHOW YOU NO MERCY WHEN WE COME IN
8643-298549-0040 HE RUSHED FROM THE ROOM WITH HIS PAPER STILL CRUMPLED UP IN HIS HAND AN INSTANT LATER WITH A GROANING OF OLD LOCKS AND A RASPING OF BARS THE LOW DOOR SWUNG OPEN AND THE PRUSSIANS POURED INTO THE STONE FLAGGED PASSAGE
8643-298549-0041 WHERE IS COUNT EUSTACE DE CHATEAU NOIR MY MASTER HE IS OUT SIR
8643-298549-0042 IT WAS LONG HOWEVER BEFORE CAPTAIN BAUMGARTEN HAD SATISFIED HIMSELF UPON THE POINT IT WAS A DIFFICULT HOUSE TO SEARCH THIN STAIRS WHICH ONLY ONE MAN COULD ASCEND AT A TIME CONNECTED LINES OF TORTUOUS CORRIDORS
8643-298549-0043 THE WALLS WERE SO THICK THAT EACH ROOM WAS CUT OFF FROM ITS NEIGHBOUR HUGE FIREPLACES YAWNED IN EACH
8643-298549-0044 CAPTAIN BAUMGARTEN STAMPED WITH HIS FEET TORE DOWN CURTAINS AND STRUCK WITH THE POMMEL OF HIS SWORD IF THERE WERE SECRET HIDING PLACES HE WAS NOT FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO FIND THEM
8643-298549-0045 I HAVE AN IDEA SAID HE AT LAST SPEAKING IN GERMAN TO THE SERGEANT YOU WILL PLACE A GUARD OVER THIS FELLOW AND MAKE SURE THAT HE COMMUNICATES WITH NO ONE YES CAPTAIN AND YOU WILL PLACE FOUR MEN IN AMBUSH AT THE FRONT AND AT THE BACK
8643-298549-0046 IT IS LIKELY ENOUGH THAT ABOUT DAYBREAK OUR BIRD MAY RETURN TO THE NEST AND THE OTHERS CAPTAIN LET THEM HAVE THEIR SUPPERS IN THE KITCHEN THE FELLOW WILL SERVE YOU WITH MEAT AND WINE
8643-298549-0047 IT IS A WILD NIGHT AND WE SHALL BE BETTER HERE THAN ON THE COUNTRY ROAD AND YOURSELF CAPTAIN I WILL TAKE MY SUPPER UP HERE IN THE DINING HALL THE LOGS ARE LAID AND WE CAN LIGHT THE FIRE YOU WILL CALL ME
8643-298549-0048 IF THERE IS ANY ALARM WHAT CAN YOU GIVE ME FOR SUPPER YOU ALAS MONSIEUR THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED WHAT YOU WISH BUT NOW IT IS ALL THAT WE CAN DO TO FIND A BOTTLE OF NEW CLARET AND A COLD PULLET
8643-298549-0049 THAT WILL DO VERY WELL LET A GUARD GO ABOUT WITH HIM SERGEANT AND LET HIM FEEL THE END OF A BAYONET IF HE PLAYS US ANY TRICKS CAPTAIN BAUMGARTEN WAS AN OLD CAMPAIGNER IN THE EASTERN PROVINCES AND BEFORE THAT IN BOHEMIA
8643-298549-0050 HE HAD LEARNED THE ART OF QUARTERING HIMSELF UPON THE ENEMY WHILE THE BUTLER BROUGHT HIS SUPPER HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF IN MAKING HIS PREPARATIONS FOR A COMFORTABLE NIGHT
8643-298549-0051 HE LIT THE CANDELABRUM OF TEN CANDLES UPON THE CENTRE TABLE THE FIRE WAS ALREADY BURNING UP CRACKLING MERRILY AND SENDING SPURTS OF BLUE PUNGENT SMOKE INTO THE ROOM THE CAPTAIN WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT
8643-298549-0052 IT WAS A SIGHT WHICH GAVE A ZEST TO HIS COMFORTABLE QUARTERS AND TO THE COLD FOWL AND THE BOTTLE OF WINE WHICH THE BUTLER HAD BROUGHT UP FOR HIM
8643-298549-0053 HE WAS TIRED AND HUNGRY AFTER HIS LONG TRAMP SO HE THREW HIS SWORD HIS HELMET AND HIS REVOLVER BELT DOWN UPON A CHAIR AND FELL TO EAGERLY UPON HIS SUPPER THEN WITH HIS GLASS OF WINE BEFORE HIM AND HIS CIGAR BETWEEN HIS LIPS
8643-298549-0054 HE TILTED HIS CHAIR BACK AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM HE SAT WITHIN A SMALL CIRCLE OF BRILLIANT LIGHT WHICH GLEAMED UPON HIS SILVER SHOULDER STRAPS AND THREW OUT HIS TERRA COTTA FACE HIS HEAVY EYEBROWS AND HIS YELLOW MOUSTACHE
8643-298549-0055 BUT OUTSIDE THAT CIRCLE THINGS WERE VAGUE AND SHADOWY IN THE OLD DINING HALL TWO SIDES WERE OAK PANELLED AND TWO WERE HUNG WITH FADED TAPESTRY ACROSS WHICH HUNTSMEN AND DOGS AND STAGS WERE STILL DIMLY STREAMING
8643-298549-0056 SO LIKE EACH OTHER THAT ONLY THE DRESS COULD DISTINGUISH THE CRUSADER FROM THE CAVALIER OF THE FRONDE CAPTAIN BAUMGARTEN
8643-298549-0057 HEAVY WITH HIS REPAST LAY BACK IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING UP AT THEM THROUGH THE CLOUDS OF HIS TOBACCO SMOKE AND PONDERING OVER THE STRANGE CHANCE
8643-298549-0058 WHICH HAD SENT HIM A MAN FROM THE BALTIC COAST TO EAT HIS SUPPER IN THE ANCESTRAL HALL OF THESE PROUD NORMAN CHIEFTAINS BUT THE FIRE WAS HOT AND THE CAPTAIN'S EYES WERE HEAVY
8643-298549-0059 HIS CHIN SANK SLOWLY UPON HIS CHEST AND THE TEN CANDLES GLEAMED UPON THE BROAD WHITE SCALP SUDDENLY A SLIGHT NOISE BROUGHT HIM TO HIS FEET FOR AN INSTANT IT SEEMED TO HIS DAZED SENSES
8643-298549-0060 THAT ONE OF THE PICTURES OPPOSITE HAD WALKED FROM ITS FRAME THERE BESIDE THE TABLE AND ALMOST WITHIN ARM'S LENGTH OF HIM WAS STANDING A HUGE MAN SILENT MOTIONLESS WITH NO SIGN OF LIFE SAVE HIS
8643-298549-0061 FIERCE GLINTING EYES HE WAS BLACK HAIRED OLIVE SKINNED WITH A POINTED TUFT OF BLACK BEARD AND A GREAT FIERCE NOSE TOWARDS WHICH ALL HIS FEATURES SEEMED TO RUN
8643-298549-0062 HIS CHEEKS WERE WRINKLED LIKE A LAST YEAR'S APPLE BUT HIS SWEEP OF SHOULDER AND BONY CORDED HANDS TOLD OF A STRENGTH WHICH WAS UNSAPPED BY AGE
8643-298549-0063 HIS ARMS WERE FOLDED ACROSS HIS ARCHING CHEST AND HIS MOUTH WAS SET IN A FIXED SMILE PRAY DO NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF TO LOOK FOR YOUR WEAPONS HE SAID AS THE PRUSSIAN CAST A SWIFT GLANCE AT THE EMPTY CHAIR IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN LAID
8643-298549-0064 YOU HAVE BEEN IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO A LITTLE INDISCREET TO MAKE YOURSELF SO MUCH AT HOME IN A HOUSE EVERY WALL OF WHICH IS HONEYCOMBED WITH SECRET PASSAGES
8643-298549-0065 YOU WILL BE AMUSED TO HEAR THAT FORTY MEN WERE WATCHING YOU AT YOUR SUPPER AH WHAT THEN CAPTAIN BAUMGARTEN HAD TAKEN A STEP FORWARD WITH CLENCHED FISTS
8643-298549-0066 IT IS THE VERY BEST IN MY CELLARS
8643-298549-0067 DRINK SIR AND BE HAPPY THERE ARE COLD JOINTS BELOW THERE ARE TWO LOBSTERS FRESH FROM HONFLEUR WILL YOU NOT VENTURE UPON A SECOND AND MORE SAVOURY SUPPER THE GERMAN OFFICER SHOOK HIS HEAD
8643-298549-0068 AND HIS HOST FILLED IT ONCE MORE PRESSING HIM TO GIVE AN ORDER FOR THIS OR THAT DAINTY THERE IS NOTHING IN MY HOUSE WHICH IS NOT AT YOUR DISPOSAL YOU HAVE BUT TO SAY THE WORD
8643-298549-0069 WELL THEN YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU A STORY WHILE YOU DRINK YOUR WINE I HAVE SO LONGED TO TELL IT TO SOME GERMAN OFFICER
8643-298549-0070 IT IS ABOUT MY SON MY ONLY CHILD EUSTACE WHO WAS TAKEN AND DIED IN ESCAPING IT IS A CURIOUS LITTLE STORY AND I THINK THAT I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT YOU WILL NEVER FORGET IT YOU MUST KNOW THEN THAT MY BOY WAS IN THE ARTILLERY
8643-298549-0071 A FINE YOUNG FELLOW CAPTAIN BAUMGARTEN AND THE PRIDE OF HIS MOTHER SHE DIED WITHIN A WEEK OF THE NEWS OF HIS DEATH REACHING US IT WAS BROUGHT BY A BROTHER OFFICER WHO WAS AT HIS SIDE THROUGHOUT AND WHO ESCAPED WHILE MY LAD DIED
8643-298549-0072 I WANT TO TELL YOU ALL THAT HE TOLD ME EUSTACE WAS TAKEN AT WEISSENBURG ON THE FOURTH OF AUGUST THE PRISONERS WERE BROKEN UP INTO PARTIES AND SENT BACK INTO GERMANY BY DIFFERENT ROUTES
8643-298549-0073 EUSTACE WAS TAKEN UPON THE FIFTH TO A VILLAGE CALLED LAUTERBURG WHERE HE MET WITH KINDNESS FROM THE GERMAN OFFICER IN COMMAND THIS GOOD COLONEL HAD THE HUNGRY LAD TO SUPPER
8643-298549-0074 OFFERED HIM THE BEST HE HAD OPENED A BOTTLE OF GOOD WINE AS I HAVE TRIED TO DO FOR YOU AND GAVE HIM A CIGAR FROM HIS OWN CASE
8643-298549-0075 THE GERMAN AGAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD HIS HORROR OF HIS COMPANION HAD INCREASED AS HE SAT WATCHING THE LIPS THAT SMILED AND THE EYES THAT GLARED THE COLONEL AS I SAY WAS GOOD TO MY BOY
8643-298549-0076 BUT UNLUCKILY THE PRISONERS WERE MOVED NEXT DAY ACROSS THE RHINE INTO ETTLINGEN THEY WERE NOT EQUALLY FORTUNATE THERE THE OFFICER WHO GUARDED THEM WAS A RUFFIAN AND A VILLAIN CAPTAIN BAUMGARTEN
8643-298549-0077 HE TOOK A PLEASURE IN HUMILIATING AND ILL TREATING THE BRAVE MEN WHO HAD FALLEN INTO HIS POWER THAT NIGHT UPON MY SON ANSWERING FIERCELY BACK TO SOME TAUNT OF HIS HE STRUCK HIM IN THE EYE LIKE THIS
8643-298549-0078 THE CRASH OF THE BLOW RANG THROUGH THE HALL THE GERMAN'S FACE FELL FORWARD HIS HAND UP AND BLOOD OOZING THROUGH HIS FINGERS THE COUNT SETTLED DOWN IN HIS CHAIR ONCE MORE MY BOY WAS DISFIGURED BY THE BLOW
8643-298549-0079 AND THIS VILLAIN MADE HIS APPEARANCE THE OBJECT OF HIS JEERS BY THE WAY YOU LOOK A LITTLE COMICAL YOURSELF AT THE PRESENT MOMENT CAPTAIN AND YOUR COLONEL WOULD CERTAINLY SAY THAT YOU HAD BEEN GETTING INTO MISCHIEF
8643-298549-0080 TO CONTINUE HOWEVER MY BOY'S YOUTH AND HIS DESTITUTION FOR HIS POCKETS WERE EMPTY MOVED THE PITY OF A KIND HEARTED MAJOR AND HE ADVANCED HIM TEN NAPOLEONS FROM HIS OWN POCKET WITHOUT SECURITY OF ANY KIND
8643-298549-0081 WOULD NOT STOOP TO TURN AWAY HIS WRATH BY A FEIGNED SUBMISSION AY THIS COWARDLY VILLAIN WHOSE HEART'S BLOOD SHALL YET CLOT UPON THIS HAND
8643-298549-0082 DARED TO STRIKE MY SON WITH HIS OPEN HAND TO KICK HIM TO TEAR HAIRS FROM HIS MOUSTACHE TO USE HIM THUS AND THUS AND THUS
8643-298549-0083 HE WAS HELPLESS IN THE HANDS OF THIS HUGE GIANT WHOSE BLOWS WERE RAINING UPON HIM WHEN AT LAST BLINDED AND HALF SENSELESS HE STAGGERED TO HIS FEET IT WAS ONLY TO BE HURLED BACK AGAIN INTO THE GREAT OAKEN CHAIR
8643-298549-0084 HE SOBBED IN HIS IMPOTENT ANGER AND SHAME MY BOY WAS FREQUENTLY MOVED TO TEARS BY THE HUMILIATION OF HIS POSITION CONTINUED THE COUNT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND ME WHEN I SAY
8643-298549-0085 WHICH HAD BEEN WOUNDED BY THE BRUTALITY OF HIS GUARD WAS BOUND UP BY A YOUNG BAVARIAN SUBALTERN WHO WAS TOUCHED BY HIS APPEARANCE I REGRET TO SEE THAT YOUR EYE IS BLEEDING SO WILL YOU PERMIT ME TO BIND IT WITH MY SILK HANDKERCHIEF
8643-298549-0086 HE LEANED FORWARD BUT THE GERMAN DASHED HIS HAND ASIDE I AM IN YOUR POWER YOU MONSTER HE CRIED I CAN ENDURE YOUR BRUTALITIES BUT NOT YOUR HYPOCRISY THE COUNT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
8643-298549-0087 I AM TAKING THINGS IN THEIR ORDER JUST AS THEY OCCURRED SAID HE I WAS UNDER VOW TO TELL IT TO THE FIRST GERMAN OFFICER WITH WHOM I COULD TALK TETE A TETE LET ME SEE
8643-298549-0088 I HAD GOT AS FAR AS THE YOUNG BAVARIAN AT CARLSRUHE I REGRET EXTREMELY THAT YOU WILL NOT PERMIT ME TO USE SUCH SLIGHT SKILL IN SURGERY AS I POSSESS AT CARLSRUHE
8643-298549-0089 MY LAD WAS SHUT UP IN THE OLD CASERNE WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A FORTNIGHT THE WORST PANG OF HIS CAPTIVITY WAS THAT SOME UNMANNERLY CURS IN THE GARRISON WOULD TAUNT HIM WITH HIS POSITION AS HE SAT BY HIS WINDOW IN THE EVENING
8643-298549-0090 THAT REMINDS ME CAPTAIN THAT YOU ARE NOT QUITE SITUATED UPON A BED OF ROSES YOURSELF ARE YOU NOW YOU CAME TO TRAP A WOLF
8643-298549-0091 MY MAN AND NOW THE BEAST HAS YOU DOWN WITH HIS FANGS IN YOUR THROAT A FAMILY MAN TOO I SHOULD JUDGE BY THAT WELL FILLED TUNIC WELL A WIDOW THE MORE WILL MAKE LITTLE MATTER
8643-298549-0092 AND THEY DO NOT USUALLY REMAIN WIDOWS LONG GET BACK INTO THE CHAIR YOU DOG WELL TO CONTINUE MY STORY
8643-298549-0093 AT THE END OF A FORTNIGHT MY SON AND HIS FRIEND ESCAPED I NEED NOT TROUBLE YOU WITH THE DANGERS WHICH THEY RAN OR WITH THE PRIVATIONS WHICH THEY ENDURED SUFFICE IT THAT TO DISGUISE THEMSELVES THEY HAD TO TAKE THE CLOTHES OF TWO PEASANTS
8643-298549-0094 WHOM THEY WAYLAID IN A WOOD HIDING BY DAY AND TRAVELLING BY NIGHT THEY HAD GOT AS FAR INTO FRANCE AS REMILLY AND WERE WITHIN A MILE A SINGLE MILE CAPTAIN
8643-298549-0095 OF CROSSING THE GERMAN LINES WHEN A PATROL OF UHLANS CAME RIGHT UPON THEM AH IT WAS HARD WAS IT NOT WHEN THEY HAD COME SO FAR AND WERE SO NEAR TO SAFETY THE COUNT BLEW A DOUBLE CALL UPON HIS WHISTLE
8643-298549-0096 AND THREE HARD FACED PEASANTS ENTERED THE ROOM THESE MUST REPRESENT MY UHLANS SAID HE WELL THEN
8643-298549-0097 WITHIN THE GERMAN LINES PROCEEDED TO HANG THEM WITHOUT TRIAL OR CEREMONY I THINK JEAN THAT THE CENTRE BEAM IS THE STRONGEST
8643-298549-0098 THE UNFORTUNATE SOLDIER WAS DRAGGED FROM HIS CHAIR TO WHERE A NOOSED ROPE HAD BEEN FLUNG OVER ONE OF THE HUGE OAKEN RAFTERS WHICH SPANNED THE ROOM
8643-298549-0099 THE THREE PEASANTS SEIZED THE OTHER END AND LOOKED TO THE COUNT FOR HIS ORDERS THE OFFICER PALE BUT FIRM FOLDED HIS ARMS AND STARED DEFIANTLY AT THE MAN WHO TORTURED HIM
