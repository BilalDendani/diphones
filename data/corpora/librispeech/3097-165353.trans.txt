3097-165353-0000 THOSE BURSTS OF ANGER AND THE LAST DRYLY SPOKEN WORDS I WILL DETAIN YOU NO LONGER GENERAL YOU SHALL RECEIVE MY LETTER BALASHEV FELT CONVINCED THAT NAPOLEON WOULD NOT WISH TO SEE HIM AND WOULD EVEN AVOID ANOTHER MEETING WITH HIM AN INSULTED ENVOY
3097-165353-0001 ESPECIALLY AS HE HAD WITNESSED HIS UNSEEMLY ANGER BUT TO HIS SURPRISE BALASHEV RECEIVED THROUGH DUROC AN INVITATION TO DINE WITH THE EMPEROR THAT DAY BESSIERES CAULAINCOURT AND BERTHIER WERE PRESENT AT THAT DINNER
3097-165353-0002 NAPOLEON MET BALASHEV CHEERFULLY AND AMIABLY HE NOT ONLY SHOWED NO SIGN OF CONSTRAINT OR SELF REPROACH ON ACCOUNT OF HIS OUTBURST THAT MORNING BUT ON THE CONTRARY TRIED TO REASSURE BALASHEV
3097-165353-0003 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HAD LONG BEEN CONVINCED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE A MISTAKE AND THAT IN HIS PERCEPTION WHATEVER HE DID WAS RIGHT NOT BECAUSE IT HARMONIZED WITH ANY IDEA OF RIGHT AND WRONG BUT BECAUSE HE DID IT
3097-165353-0004 THE EMPEROR WAS IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS AFTER HIS RIDE THROUGH VILNA WHERE CROWDS OF PEOPLE HAD RAPTUROUSLY GREETED AND FOLLOWED HIM FROM ALL THE WINDOWS OF THE STREETS THROUGH WHICH HE RODE RUGS FLAGS AND HIS MONOGRAM WERE DISPLAYED
3097-165353-0005 AND THE POLISH LADIES WELCOMING HIM WAVED THEIR HANDKERCHIEFS TO HIM AT DINNER HAVING PLACED BALASHEV BESIDE HIM NAPOLEON NOT ONLY TREATED HIM AMIABLY BUT BEHAVED AS IF BALASHEV WERE ONE OF HIS OWN COURTIERS ONE OF THOSE WHO SYMPATHIZED WITH HIS PLANS
3097-165353-0006 AND OUGHT TO REJOICE AT HIS SUCCESS IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION HE MENTIONED MOSCOW AND QUESTIONED BALASHEV ABOUT THE RUSSIAN CAPITAL NOT MERELY AS AN INTERESTED TRAVELER ASKS ABOUT A NEW CITY HE INTENDS TO VISIT
3097-165353-0007 HOW MANY INHABITANTS ARE THERE IN MOSCOW HOW MANY HOUSES IS IT TRUE THAT MOSCOW IS CALLED HOLY MOSCOW HOW MANY CHURCHES ARE THERE IN MOSCOW HE ASKED AND RECEIVING THE REPLY THAT THERE WERE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED CHURCHES HE REMARKED
3097-165353-0008 WHY SUCH A QUANTITY OF CHURCHES THE RUSSIANS ARE VERY DEVOUT REPLIED BALASHEV BUT A LARGE NUMBER OF MONASTERIES AND CHURCHES IS ALWAYS A SIGN OF THE BACKWARDNESS OF A PEOPLE SAID NAPOLEON TURNING TO CAULAINCOURT FOR APPRECIATION OF THIS REMARK
3097-165353-0009 BALASHEV RESPECTFULLY VENTURED TO DISAGREE WITH THE FRENCH EMPEROR EVERY COUNTRY HAS ITS OWN CHARACTER SAID HE BUT NOWHERE IN EUROPE IS THERE ANYTHING LIKE THAT SAID NAPOLEON I BEG YOUR MAJESTY'S PARDON RETURNED BALASHEV BESIDES
3097-165353-0010 RUSSIA THERE IS SPAIN WHERE THERE ARE ALSO MANY CHURCHES AND MONASTERIES THIS REPLY OF BALASHEV'S WHICH HINTED AT THE RECENT DEFEATS OF THE FRENCH IN SPAIN WAS MUCH APPRECIATED WHEN HE RELATED IT AT ALEXANDER'S COURT BUT IT WAS NOT MUCH APPRECIATED AT NAPOLEON'S DINNER
3097-165353-0011 WHERE IT PASSED UNNOTICED THE UNINTERESTED AND PERPLEXED FACES OF THE MARSHALS SHOWED THAT THEY WERE PUZZLED AS TO WHAT BALASHEV'S TONE SUGGESTED IF THERE IS A POINT WE DON'T SEE IT OR IT IS NOT AT ALL WITTY THEIR EXPRESSIONS SEEMED TO SAY
3097-165353-0012 SO ALL ROADS LEAD TO MOSCOW THERE WERE MANY ROADS AND AMONG THEM THE ROAD THROUGH POLTAVA
3097-165353-0013 AFTER DINNER THEY WENT TO DRINK COFFEE IN NAPOLEON'S STUDY WHICH FOUR DAYS PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN THAT OF THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER
3097-165353-0014 NAPOLEON WAS IN THAT WELL KNOWN AFTER DINNER MOOD WHICH MORE THAN ANY REASONED CAUSE MAKES A MAN CONTENTED WITH HIMSELF AND DISPOSED TO CONSIDER EVERYONE HIS FRIEND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS SURROUNDED BY MEN WHO ADORED HIM
3097-165353-0015 NAPOLEON TURNED TO HIM WITH A PLEASANT THOUGH SLIGHTLY IRONIC SMILE THEY TELL ME THIS IS THE ROOM THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER OCCUPIED STRANGE ISN'T IT GENERAL HE SAID EVIDENTLY NOT DOUBTING THAT THIS REMARK WOULD BE AGREEABLE TO HIS HEARER
3097-165353-0016 SINCE IT WENT TO PROVE HIS NAPOLEON'S SUPERIORITY TO ALEXANDER BALASHEV MADE NO REPLY
3097-165353-0017 YES FOUR DAYS AGO IN THIS ROOM WINTZINGERODE AND STEIN WERE DELIBERATING CONTINUED NAPOLEON WITH THE SAME DERISIVE AND SELF CONFIDENT SMILE
3097-165353-0018 THAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
3097-165353-0019 AND LET HIM KNOW THAT I WILL DO SO SAID NAPOLEON RISING AND PUSHING HIS CUP AWAY WITH HIS HAND
3097-165353-0020 YES I'LL DRIVE THEM OUT LET HIM PREPARE AN ASYLUM FOR THEM IN RUSSIA
3097-165353-0021 AND ONLY LISTENED BECAUSE HE COULD NOT HELP HEARING WHAT WAS SAID TO HIM NAPOLEON DID NOT NOTICE THIS EXPRESSION HE TREATED BALASHEV NOT AS AN ENVOY FROM HIS ENEMY BUT AS A MAN NOW FULLY DEVOTED TO HIM
3097-165353-0022 AND WHO MUST REJOICE AT HIS FORMER MASTER'S HUMILIATION AND WHY HAS THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER TAKEN COMMAND OF THE ARMIES
3097-165353-0023 WAR IS MY PROFESSION BUT HIS BUSINESS IS TO REIGN AND NOT TO COMMAND ARMIES
3097-165353-0024 AGAIN NAPOLEON BROUGHT OUT HIS SNUFFBOX PACED SEVERAL TIMES UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN SILENCE
3097-165353-0025 AS CONFIDENTLY QUICKLY AND SIMPLY AS IF HE WERE DOING SOMETHING NOT MERELY IMPORTANT BUT PLEASING TO BALASHEV HE RAISED HIS HAND TO THE FORTY YEAR OLD RUSSIAN GENERAL'S FACE AND TAKING HIM BY THE EAR PULLED IT GENTLY SMILING WITH HIS LIPS ONLY
3097-165353-0026 TO HAVE ONE'S EAR PULLED BY THE EMPEROR WAS CONSIDERED THE GREATEST HONOR AND MARK OF FAVOR AT THE FRENCH COURT WELL ADORER AND COURTIER OF THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER
3097-165353-0027 WHY DON'T YOU SAY ANYTHING SAID HE AS IF IT WAS RIDICULOUS IN HIS PRESENCE
