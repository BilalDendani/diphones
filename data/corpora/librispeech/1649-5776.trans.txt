1649-5776-0000 THAT BRAVE KNIGHT HAPPENED TO BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THE VERY SAME NIGHT IN WHICH DE VALENCE FLED BEFORE THE ARMS OF WALLACE ACROSS THE CLYDE AND HE NO SOONER SAW THE SCOTTISH COLORS ON THE WALLS OF DUMBARTON THAN FINDING OUT WHO WAS THEIR PLANTER
1649-5776-0001 HIS SOUL TOOK FIRE AND STUNG WITH A GENEROUS AMBITION OF EQUALING IN GLORY HIS EQUAL IN YEARS HE DETERMINED TO ASSIST WHILE HE EMULATED THE VICTOR TO THIS END
1649-5776-0002 HE TRAVERSED THE ADJOINING COUNTRY STRIVING TO ENLIGHTEN THE UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE STUPIDLY SATISFIED AND TO EXCITE THE DISCONTENTED TO REVOLT WITH MOST HE FAILED
1649-5776-0003 SOME TOOK UPON THEM TO LECTURE HIM ON FISHING IN TROUBLED WATERS AND WARNED HIM IF HE WOULD KEEP HIS HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS TO WEAR HIS YOKE IN PEACE OTHERS THOUGHT THE PROJECT TOO ARDUOUS FOR MEN OF SMALL MEANS
1649-5776-0004 THEY WISHED WELL TO THE ARMS OF SIR WILLIAM WALLACE AND SHOULD HE CONTINUE SUCCESSFUL WOULD WATCH THE MOMENT TO AID HIM WITH ALL THEIR LITTLE POWER THOSE WHO HAD MUCH PROPERTY FEARED TO RISK ITS LOSS BY EMBRACING A DOUBTFUL STRUGGLE
1649-5776-0005 SOME WERE TOO GREAT COWARDS TO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS THEY WOULD GLADLY REGAIN BY THE EXERTIONS OF OTHERS
1649-5776-0006 BUT EXPOSE THEIR OFFSPRING TO THE REVENGE OF A RESENTFUL ENEMY THIS WAS THE BEST APOLOGY OF ANY THAT HAD BEEN OFFERED NATURAL AFFECTION WAS THE PLEADER AND THOUGH BLINDED TO ITS TRUE INTEREST SUCH WEAKNESS HAD AN AMIABLE SOURCE AND SO WAS PARDONED
1649-5776-0007 YOU WILL SEND YOUR HIRELINGS TO TOW HIM IN BUT IF A PLANK COULD SAVE HIM NOW YOU WOULD NOT THROW IT TO HIM I UNDERSTAND YOU SIRS AND SHALL TROUBLE YOUR PATRIOTISM NO MORE IN SHORT
1649-5776-0008 AND A FEW BRAVE SPIRITS WHO WOULD PUT ALL TO THE HAZARD FOR SO GOOD A CAUSE COULD BE PREVAILED ON TO HOLD THEMSELVES IN READINESS TO OBEY SIR EUSTACE WHEN HE SHOULD SEE THE MOMENT TO CONDUCT THEM TO SIR WILLIAM WALLACE
1649-5776-0009 HE WAS TRYING HIS ELOQUENCE AMONG THE CLAN AT LENNOX WHEN KER ARRIVING STAMPED HIS PERSUASIONS WITH TRUTH AND ABOVE FIVE HUNDRED MEN ARRANGED THEMSELVES UNDER THEIR LORD'S STANDARD MAXWELL GLADLY EXPLAINED HIMSELF TO WALLACE'S LIEUTENANT
1649-5776-0010 AND SUMMONING HIS LITTLE RESERVE THEY MARCHED WITH FLYING PENNONS THROUGH THE TOWN OF DUMBARTON
1649-5776-0011 AND SANCTIONED BY THE EXAMPLE OF THE EARL OF LENNOX WHOSE NAME HELD A GREAT INFLUENCE IN THOSE PARTS SEVERAL WHO BEFORE HAD HELD BACK FROM DOUBTING THEIR OWN JUDGMENT NOW CAME FORWARD AND NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED WELL APPOINTED MEN MARCHED INTO THE FORTRESS
1649-5776-0012 A COUNCIL BEING HELD RESPECTING THE DISPOSAL OF THE NEW TROOPS IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE LENNOX MEN MUST REMAIN WITH THEIR EARL IN GARRISON WHILE THOSE BROUGHT BY MAXWELL AND UNDER HIS COMMAND SHOULD FOLLOW WALLACE IN THE PROSECUTION OF HIS CONQUESTS ALONG WITH HIS OWN ESPECIAL PEOPLE
1649-5776-0013 AND WHERE THE POSSESSION OF SUCH A CASTLE WOULD COMPEL THE NEIGHBORING ONES TO SURRENDER AND WHERE OCCUPYING THE HILLS WITH BANDS OF RESOLUTE SCOTS WOULD BE A MORE EFFICIENT BULWARK THAN A THOUSAND TOWERS THAT MAXWELL GAZED ON HIM WITH ADMIRATION AND LENNOX WITH WONDER
1649-5776-0014 MAR HAD SEEN THE POWER OF HIS ARMS MURRAY HAD ALREADY DRUNK THE EXPERIENCE OF A VETERAN FROM HIS GENIUS HENCE THEY WERE NOT SURPRISED ON HEARING THAT WHICH FILLED STRANGERS WITH AMAZEMENT
1649-5776-0015 OR WERE VISITED IN VISION BY SOME HEROIC SHADE WHO OFFERED TO HIS SLEEPING FANCY DESIGNS FAR VASTER THAN HIS WAKING FACULTIES COULD HAVE CONCEIVED HE HAD THOUGHT THAT THE YOUNG WALLACE MIGHT HAVE WON DUMBARTON BY A BOLD STROKE AND THAT WHEN HIS INVINCIBLE COURAGE SHOULD BE STEERED BY STROKE
1649-5776-0016 AND THAT WHEN HIS INVINCIBLE COURAGE SHOULD BE STEERED BY GRAVER HEADS EVERY SUCCESS MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM HIS ARMS AND SAW THAT WHEN TURNED TO ANY CAUSE OF POLICY THE GORDIAN KNOT OF IT HE DID UNLOOSE FAMILIAR AS HIS GARTER HE MARVELED AND SAID WITHIN HIMSELF
1649-5776-0017 BUT WHEN SCOTLAND LOST HER FREEDOM AS THE SWORD WAS NOT DRAWN IN HER DEFENSE I LOOKED NOT WHERE IT LAY I THEN STUDIED THE ARTS OF PEACE THAT IS OVER AND NOW THE PASSION OF MY SOUL REVIVES WHEN THE MIND IS BENT ON ONE OBJECT ONLY
1649-5776-0018 ALL BECOMES CLEAR THAT LEADS TO IT ZEAL IN SUCH CASES IS ALMOST GENIUS SOON AFTER THESE OBSERVATIONS IT WAS ADMITTED THAT WALLACE MIGHT ATTEND LORD MAR AND HIS FAMILY ON THE MORROW TO THE ISLE OF BUTE
1649-5776-0019 WHEN THE DAWN BROKE HE AROSE FROM HIS HEATHER BED IN THE GREAT TOWER AND HAVING CALLED FORTH TWENTY OF THE BOTHWELL MEN TO ESCORT THEIR LORD HE TOLD IRELAND HE SHOULD EXPECT TO HAVE A CHEERING ACCOUNT OF THE WOUNDED ON HIS RETURN
1649-5776-0020 THERE MY DEAR LORD SAID HE PRESENTING IT IT WILL NOT DISHONOR YOUR HAND FOR IT CUT DOWN MANY A PROUD NORWEGIAN ON THE FIELD OF LARGS WALLACE TOOK THE SWORD AND TURNED TO MEET MURRAY WITH EDWIN IN THE PORTAL WHEN THEY REACHED THE CITADEL
1649-5776-0021 LORD MAR BETWEEN MURRAY AND EDWIN FOLLOWED AND THE SERVANTS AND GUARD COMPLETED THE SUIT BEING WELL MOUNTED THEY PLEASANTLY PURSUED THEIR WAY AVOIDING ALL INHABITED PLACES AND RESTING IN THE DEEPEST RECESSES OF THE HILLS
1649-5776-0022 LORD MAR PROPOSED TRAVELING ALL NIGHT BUT AT THE CLOSE OF THE EVENING HIS COUNTESS COMPLAINED OF FATIGUE DECLARING SHE COULD NOT ADVANCE FURTHER THAN THE EASTERN BANK OF THE RIVER CART
1649-5776-0023 AND SEEING THEM LAID TO REST PLANTED HIS MEN TO KEEP GUARD AROUND THE CIRCLE THE MOON HAD SUNK IN THE WEST BEFORE THE WHOLE OF HIS LITTLE CAMP WERE ASLEEP BUT WHEN ALL SEEMED COMPOSED HE WANDERED FORTH BY THE DIM LIGHT OF THE STARS TO VIEW THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY
1649-5776-0024 HIS COUNTRY'S ENEMIES HAD LEVELED WITH THE GROUND HE TURNED IN ANGUISH OF HEART TOWARD THE SOUTH FOR THERE LESS RACKING REMEMBRANCES HOVERED OVER THE DISTANT HILLS LEANING ON THE SHATTERED STUMP OF AN OLD TREE HE FIXED HIS EYES ON THE FAR STRETCHING PLAIN
1649-5776-0025 WHICH ALONE SEEMED TO DIVIDE HIM FROM THE VENERABLE SIR RONALD CRAWFORD AND HIS YOUTHFUL HAUNTS AT AYR FULL OF THOUGHTS OF HER WHO USED TO SHARE THOSE HAPPY SCENES HE HEARD A SIGH BEHIND HIM HE TURNED ROUND AND BEHELD A FEMALE FIGURE DISAPPEAR AMONG THE TREES
1649-5776-0026 THE SILVER LIGHT OF THE STARS WAS NOT BRIGHTER THAN ITS AIRY ROBES WHICH FLOATED IN THE WIND HIS HEART PAUSED IT BEAT VIOLENTLY STILL THE FIGURE ADVANCED
1649-5776-0027 BUT IT FLED AND AGAIN VANISHED HE DROPPED UPON THE GROUND IN SPEECHLESS DISAPPOINTMENT TIS FALSE CRIED HE RECOVERING FROM HIS FIRST EXPECTATION TIS A PHANTOM OF MY OWN CREATING
1649-5776-0028 THE PURE SPIRIT OF MARION WOULD NEVER FLY FROM ME I LOVED HER TOO WELL SHE WOULD NOT THUS REDOUBLE MY GRIEF BUT I SHALL GO TO THEE WIFE OF MY SOUL CRIED HE AND THAT IS COMFORT BALM INDEED IS THE CHRISTIAN'S HOPE
1649-5776-0029 SUCH WERE HIS WORDS SUCH WERE HIS THOUGHTS TILL THE COLDNESS OF THE HOUR AND THE EXHAUSTION OF NATURE PUTTING A FRIENDLY SEAL UPON HIS SENSES HE SUNK UPON THE BANK AND FELL INTO A PROFOUND SLEEP
1649-5776-0030 WHEN HE AWOKE THE LARK WAS CAROLING ABOVE HIS HEAD AND TO HIS SURPRISE HE FOUND A PLAID WAS LAID OVER HIM HE THREW IT OFF AND BEHELD EDWIN SEATED AT HIS FEET
1649-5776-0031 THIS HAS BEEN YOUR DOING MY KIND BROTHER SAID HE BUT HOW CAME YOU TO DISCOVER ME I MISSED YOU WHEN THE DAWN BROKE AND AT LAST FOUND YOU HERE SLEEPING UNDER THE DEW AND HAS NONE ELSE BEEN ASTIR INQUIRED WALLACE THINKING OF THE FIGURE HE HAD SEEN
1649-5776-0032 FINDING EVERYBODY READY HE TOOK HIS STATION AND SETTING FORTH ALL PROCEEDED CHEERFULLY THOUGH SLOWLY THROUGH THE DELIGHTFUL VALLEYS OF BAROCHAN BY SUNSET THEY ARRIVED AT THE POINT OF EMBARKATION
