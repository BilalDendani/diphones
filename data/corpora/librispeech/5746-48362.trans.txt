5746-48362-0000 CONCERNING THE DISEASE THAT HEROD FELL INTO AND THE SEDITION WHICH THE JEWS RAISED THEREUPON
5746-48362-0001 BUT SENT AS INSTRUCTED BEFOREHAND WHAT ANSWERS THEY WERE TO MAKE TO THE QUESTIONS PUT TO THEM THEY ALSO CARRIED THE EPISTLES WITH THEM BUT HEROD NOW FELL INTO A DISTEMPER AND MADE HIS WILL AND BEQUEATHED HIS KINGDOM TO ANTIPAS HIS YOUNGEST SON
5746-48362-0002 AND THIS OUT OF THAT HATRED TO ARCHCLAUS AND PHILIP WHICH THE CALUMNIES OF ANTIPATER HAD RAISED AGAINST THEM HE ALSO BEQUEATHED A THOUSAND TALENTS TO CAESAR AND FIVE HUNDRED TO JULIA CAESAR'S WIFE TO CAESAR'S CHILDREN AND FRIENDS AND FREED MEN
5746-48362-0003 HE ALSO DISTRIBUTED AMONG HIS SONS AND THEIR SONS HIS MONEY HIS REVENUES AND HIS LANDS
5746-48362-0004 AND AS HE DESPAIRED OF RECOVERING FOR HE WAS ABOUT THE SEVENTIETH YEAR OF HIS AGE HE GREW FIERCE AND INDULGED THE BITTEREST ANGER UPON ALL OCCASIONS THE CAUSE WHEREOF WAS THIS THAT HE THOUGHT HIMSELF DESPISED AND THAT THE NATION WAS PLEASED WITH HIS MISFORTUNES
5746-48362-0005 TWO OF THE MOST ELOQUENT MEN AMONG THE JEWS AND THE MOST CELEBRATED INTERPRETERS OF THE JEWISH LAWS AND MEN WELL BELOVED BY THE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THEIR EDUCATION OF THEIR YOUTH FOR ALL THOSE THAT WERE STUDIOUS OF VIRTUE FREQUENTED THEIR LECTURES EVERY DAY
5746-48362-0006 THESE MEN WHEN THEY FOUND THAT THE KING'S DISTEMPER WAS INCURABLE EXCITED THE YOUNG MEN THAT THEY WOULD PULL DOWN ALL THOSE WORKS WHICH THE KING HAD ERECTED CONTRARY TO THE LAW OF THEIR FATHERS AND THEREBY OBTAIN THE REWARDS WHICH THE LAW WILL CONFER ON THEM FOR SUCH ACTIONS OF PIETY
5746-48362-0007 FOR HEROD HAD CAUSED SUCH THINGS TO BE MADE WHICH WERE CONTRARY TO THE LAW OF WHICH HE WAS ACCUSED BY JUDAS AND MATTHIAS FOR THE KING HAD ERECTED OVER THE GREAT GATE OF THE TEMPLE A LARGE GOLDEN EAGLE OF GREAT VALUE AND HAD DEDICATED IT TO THE TEMPLE
5746-48362-0008 NOW THE LAW FORBIDS THOSE THAT PROPOSE TO LIVE ACCORDING TO IT
5746-48362-0009 SINCE THAT COMMON CALAMITY OF DYING CANNOT BE AVOIDED BY OUR LIVING SO AS TO ESCAPE ANY SUCH DANGERS THAT THEREFORE IT IS A RIGHT THING FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN LOVE WITH A VIRTUOUS CONDUCT TO WAIT FOR THAT FATAL HOUR BY SUCH BEHAVIOR AS MAY CARRY THEM OUT OF THE WORLD WITH PRAISE AND HONOR
5746-48362-0010 AND THAT THIS WILL ALLEVIATE DEATH TO A GREAT DEGREE THUS TO COME AT IT BY THE PERFORMANCE OF BRAVE ACTIONS WHICH BRING US INTO DANGER OF IT AND AT THE SAME TIME TO LEAVE THAT REPUTATION BEHIND THEM TO THEIR CHILDREN AND TO ALL THEIR RELATIONS WHETHER THEY BE MEN OR WOMEN
5746-48362-0011 DID THESE MEN EXCITE THE YOUNG MEN TO THIS ACTION
5746-48362-0012 THIS WAS AN ADDITION TO THE WISE MEN'S PERSUASIONS SO IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE DAY THEY GOT UPON THE PLACE THEY PULLED DOWN THE EAGLE AND CUT IT INTO PIECES WITH AXES WHILE A GREAT NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE WERE IN THE TEMPLE
5746-48362-0013 AND NOW THE KING'S CAPTAIN UPON HEARING WHAT THE UNDERTAKING WAS AND SUPPOSING IT WAS A THING OF A HIGHER NATURE THAN IT PROVED TO BE CAME UP THITHER HAVING A GREAT BAND OF SOLDIERS WITH HIM SUCH AS WAS SUFFICIENT TO PUT A STOP TO THE MULTITUDE OF THOSE WHO PULLED DOWN WHAT WAS DEDICATED TO GOD
5746-48362-0014 SO HE FELL UPON THEM UNEXPECTEDLY AND AS THEY WERE UPON THIS BOLD ATTEMPT IN A FOOLISH PRESUMPTION RATHER THAN A CAUTIOUS CIRCUMSPECTION AS IS USUAL WITH THE MULTITUDE
5746-48362-0015 AND WHILE THEY WERE IN DISORDER AND INCAUTIOUS OF WHAT WAS FOR THEIR ADVANTAGE SO HE CAUGHT NO FEWER THAN FORTY OF THE YOUNG MEN WHO HAD THE COURAGE TO STAY BEHIND WHEN THE REST RAN AWAY TOGETHER WITH THE AUTHORS OF THIS BOLD ATTEMPT
5746-48362-0016 WHO THOUGHT IT AN IGNOMINIOUS THING TO RETIRE UPON HIS APPROACH AND LED THEM TO THE KING
5746-48362-0017 YES SAID THEY WHAT WAS CONTRIVED WE CONTRIVED AND WHAT HATH BEEN PERFORMED WE PERFORMED IT AND THAT WITH SUCH A VIRTUOUS COURAGE AS BECOMES MEN FOR WE HAVE GIVEN OUR ASSISTANCE TO THOSE THINGS WHICH WERE DEDICATED TO THE MAJESTY OF GOD AND WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED BY HEARING THE LAW
5746-48362-0018 AND IT OUGHT NOT TO BE WONDERED AT IF WE ESTEEM THOSE LAWS WHICH MOSES HAD SUGGESTED TO HIM AND WERE TAUGHT HIM BY GOD AND WHICH HE WROTE AND LEFT BEHIND HIM MORE WORTHY OF OBSERVATION THAN THY COMMANDS ACCORDINGLY
5746-48362-0019 AND THUS THEY ALL SAID AND THEIR COURAGE WAS STILL EQUAL TO THEIR PROFESSION AND EQUAL TO THAT WITH WHICH THEY READILY SET ABOUT THIS UNDERTAKING
5746-48362-0020 AND WHEN THEY WERE COME HE MADE THEM ASSEMBLE IN THE THEATER AND BECAUSE HE COULD NOT HIMSELF STAND HE LAY UPON A COUCH AND ENUMERATED THE MANY LABORS THAT HE HAD LONG ENDURED ON THEIR ACCOUNT AND HIS BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE AND WHAT A VAST CHARGE THAT WAS TO HIM
5746-48362-0021 THAT HE HAD ALSO ADORNED IT WITH VERY VALUABLE DONATIONS ON WHICH ACCOUNT HE HOPED THAT HE HAD LEFT HIMSELF A MEMORIAL AND PROCURED HIMSELF A REPUTATION AFTER HIS DEATH HE THEN CRIED OUT THAT THESE MEN HAD NOT ABSTAINED FROM AFFRONTING HIM EVEN IN HIS LIFETIME BUT THAT IN THE VERY DAY TIME
5746-48362-0022 AND IN THE SIGHT OF THE MULTITUDE THEY HAD ABUSED HIM TO THAT DEGREE AS TO FALL UPON WHAT HE HAD DEDICATED AND IN THAT WAY OF ABUSE HAD PULLED IT DOWN TO THE GROUND THEY PRETENDED INDEED THAT THEY DID IT TO AFFRONT HIM BUT IF ANY ONE CONSIDER THE THING TRULY
5746-48362-0023 HE DEPRIVED MATTHIAS OF THE HIGH PRIESTHOOD AS IN PART AN OCCASION OF THIS ACTION AND MADE JOAZAR WHO WAS MATTHIAS'S WIFE'S BROTHER HIGH PRIEST IN HIS STEAD
5746-48362-0024 AND BECAUSE HE COULD NOT OFFICIATE HIMSELF ON THAT ACCOUNT JOSEPH THE SON OF ELLEMUS HIS KINSMAN ASSISTED HIM IN THAT SACRED OFFICE BUT HEROD DEPRIVED THIS MATTHIAS OF THE HIGH PRIESTHOOD AND BURNT THE OTHER MATTHIAS WHO HAD RAISED THE SEDITION WITH HIS COMPANIONS ALIVE AND THAT VERY NIGHT
5746-48362-0025 AND THIS BY GOD'S JUDGMENT UPON HIM FOR HIS SINS FOR A FIRE GLOWED IN HIM SLOWLY WHICH DID NOT SO MUCH APPEAR TO THE TOUCH OUTWARDLY AS IT AUGMENTED HIS PAINS INWARDLY
5746-48362-0026 HIS ENTRAILS WERE ALSO EX ULCERATED
5746-48362-0027 AN AQUEOUS AND TRANSPARENT LIQUOR ALSO HAD SETTLED ITSELF ABOUT HIS FEET AND A LIKE MATTER AFFLICTED HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS BELLY NAY FURTHER
5746-48362-0028 HIS PRIVY MEMBER WAS PUTREFIED AND PRODUCED WORMS AND WHEN HE SAT UPRIGHT HE HAD A DIFFICULTY OF BREATHING WHICH WAS VERY LOATHSOME ON ACCOUNT OF THE STENCH OF HIS BREATH AND THE QUICKNESS OF ITS RETURNS
5746-48362-0029 HE HAD ALSO CONVULSIONS IN ALL PARTS OF HIS BODY WHICH INCREASED HIS STRENGTH TO AN INSUFFERABLE DEGREE IT WAS SAID BY THOSE WHO PRETENDED TO DIVINE AND WHO WERE ENDUED WITH WISDOM TO FORETELL SUCH THINGS
5746-48362-0030 WERE ALSO FIT TO DRINK WHICH WATER RUNS INTO THE LAKE CALLED ASPHALTIRIS AND WHEN THE PHYSICIANS ONCE THOUGHT FIT TO HAVE HIM BATHED IN A VESSEL FULL OF OIL IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS JUST DYING
5746-48362-0031 BUT UPON THE LAMENTABLE CRIES OF HIS DOMESTICS HE REVIVED AND HAVING NO LONGER THE LEAST HOPES OF RECOVERING
5746-48362-0032 AND HE ALSO GAVE A GREAT DEAL TO THEIR COMMANDERS AND TO HIS FRIENDS AND CAME AGAIN TO JERICHO WHERE HE GREW SO CHOLERIC THAT IT BROUGHT HIM TO DO ALL THINGS LIKE A MADMAN AND THOUGH HE WERE NEAR HIS DEATH HE CONTRIVED THE FOLLOWING WICKED DESIGNS
5746-48362-0033 HE COMMANDED THAT ALL THE PRINCIPAL MEN OF THE ENTIRE JEWISH NATION WHERESOEVER THEY LIVED SHOULD BE CALLED TO HIM ACCORDINGLY THEY WERE A GREAT NUMBER THAT CAME BECAUSE THE WHOLE NATION WAS CALLED AND ALL MEN HEARD OF THIS CALL AND DEATH
5746-48362-0034 WAS THE PENALTY OF SUCH AS SHOULD DESPISE THE EPISTLES THAT WERE SENT TO CALL THEM AND NOW THE KING WAS IN A WILD RAGE AGAINST THEM ALL THE INNOCENT AS WELL AS THOSE THAT HAD AFFORDED GROUND FOR ACCUSATIONS
5746-48362-0035 I SHALL DIE IN A LITTLE TIME SO GREAT ARE MY PAINS WHICH DEATH OUGHT TO BE CHEERFULLY BORNE AND TO BE WELCOMED BY ALL MEN BUT WHAT PRINCIPALLY TROUBLES ME IS THIS THAT I SHALL DIE WITHOUT BEING LAMENTED
5746-48362-0036 AND WITHOUT SUCH MOURNING AS MEN USUALLY EXPECT AT A KING'S DEATH
5746-48362-0037 BUT BY THOSE COMMANDS OF HIS WHICH SAVORED OF NO HUMANITY SINCE HE TOOK CARE WHEN HE WAS DEPARTING OUT OF THIS LIFE THAT THE WHOLE NATION SHOULD BE PUT INTO MOURNING AND INDEED MADE DESOLATE OF THEIR DEAREST KINDRED
5746-48362-0038 WHEN HE GAVE ORDER THAT ONE OUT OF EVERY FAMILY SHOULD BE SLAIN ALTHOUGH THEY HAD DONE NOTHING THAT WAS UNJUST OR THAT WAS AGAINST HIM NOR WERE THEY ACCUSED OF ANY OTHER CRIMES WHILE IT IS USUAL FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ANY REGARD TO VIRTUE TO LAY ASIDE THEIR HATRED AT SUCH A TIME
5746-48362-0039 WHICH WHEN THEY WERE READ THEIR PURPORT WAS THIS THAT ACME WAS SLAIN BY CAESAR OUT OF HIS INDIGNATION AT WHAT HAND SHE HAD IN ANTIPATER'S WICKED PRACTICES
5746-48362-0040 AND THAT AS TO ANTIPATER HIMSELF CAESAR LEFT IT TO HEROD TO ACT AS BECAME A FATHER AND A KING AND EITHER TO BANISH HIM OR TO TAKE AWAY HIS LIFE WHICH HE PLEASED WHEN HEROD HEARD THIS HE WAS SOME WHAT BETTER OUT OF THE PLEASURE HE HAD FROM THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTERS
5746-48362-0041 AND WAS ELEVATED AT THE DEATH OF ACME AND AT THE POWER THAT WAS GIVEN HIM OVER HIS SON BUT AS HIS PAINS WERE BECOME VERY GREAT HE WAS NOW READY TO FAINT FOR WANT OF SOMEWHAT TO EAT
5746-48362-0042 SO HE CALLED FOR AN APPLE AND A KNIFE FOR IT WAS HIS CUSTOM FORMERLY TO PARE THE APPLE HIMSELF AND SOON AFTERWARDS TO CUT IT AND EAT IT WHEN HE HAD GOT THE KNIFE HE LOOKED ABOUT AND HAD A MIND TO STAB HIMSELF WITH IT
5746-48362-0043 WHEREUPON A WOEFUL LAMENTATION ECHOED THROUGH THE PALACE AND A GREAT TUMULT WAS MADE AS IF THE KING WERE DEAD UPON WHICH ANTIPATER WHO VERILY BELIEVED HIS FATHER WAS DECEASED
5746-48362-0044 GREW BOLD IN HIS DISCOURSE AS HOPING TO BE IMMEDIATELY AND ENTIRELY RELEASED FROM HIS BONDS AND TO TAKE THE KINGDOM INTO HIS HANDS WITHOUT ANY MORE ADO SO HE DISCOURSED WITH THE JAILER ABOUT LETTING HIM GO AND IN THAT CASE PROMISED HIM GREAT THINGS BOTH NOW AND HEREAFTER
5746-48362-0045 AS IF THAT WERE THE ONLY THING NOW IN QUESTION
5746-48362-0046 AND RAISED HIMSELF UPON HIS ELBOW AND SENT FOR SOME OF HIS GUARDS AND COMMANDED THEM TO KILL ANTIPATER WITHOUT TINY FURTHER DELAY AND TO DO IT PRESENTLY AND TO BURY HIM IN AN IGNOBLE MANNER AT HYRCANIA CHAPTER EIGHT
5746-48362-0047 AND TO CERTAIN OTHERS FIVE MILLIONS WHEN HE HAD DONE THESE THINGS HE DIED THE FIFTH DAY AFTER HE HAD CAUSED ANTIPATER TO BE SLAIN HAVING REIGNED SINCE HE HAD PROCURED ANTIGONUS TO BE SLAIN THIRTY FOUR YEARS
5746-48362-0048 BUT ABOVE THE CONSIDERATION OF WHAT WAS RIGHT YET WAS HE FAVORED BY FORTUNE AS MUCH AS ANY MAN EVER WAS FOR FROM A PRIVATE MAN HE BECAME A KING AND THOUGH HE WERE ENCOMPASSED WITH TEN THOUSAND DANGERS
5746-48362-0049 HE GOT CLEAR OF THEM ALL AND CONTINUED HIS LIFE TILL A VERY OLD AGE BUT THEN AS TO THE AFFAIRS OF HIS FAMILY AND CHILDREN IN WHICH INDEED ACCORDING TO HIS OWN OPINION HE WAS ALSO VERY FORTUNATE BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO CONQUER HIS ENEMIES
5746-48362-0050 DISMISSED THOSE THAT WERE SHUT UP IN THE HIPPODROME AND TOLD THEM THAT THE KING ORDERED THEM TO GO AWAY TO THEIR OWN LANDS AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN AFFAIRS WHICH WAS ESTEEMED BY THE NATION A GREAT BENEFIT AND NOW THE KING'S DEATH WAS MADE PUBLIC
5746-48362-0051 AND THE FIRST THING THEY DID WAS THEY READ HEROD'S LETTER WRITTEN TO THE SOLDIERY THANKING THEM FOR THEIR FIDELITY AND GOOD WILL TO HIM AND EXHORTING THEM TO AFFORD HIS SON ARCHELAUS WHOM HE HAD APPOINTED FOR THEIR KING LIKE FIDELITY AND GOOD WILL
5746-48362-0052 AFTER WHICH PTOLEMY WHO HAD THE KING'S SEAL INTRUSTED TO HIM READ THE KING'S TESTAMENT WHICH WAS TO BE OF FORCE NO OTHERWISE THAN AS IT SHOULD STAND WHEN CAESAR HAD INSPECTED IT
5746-48362-0053 SO THERE WAS PRESENTLY AN ACCLAMATION MADE TO ARCHELAUS AS KING AND THE SOLDIERS CAME BY BANDS AND THEIR COMMANDERS WITH THEM AND PROMISED THE SAME GOOD WILL TO HIM AND READINESS TO SERVE HIM WHICH THEY HAD EXHIBITED TO HEROD
5746-48362-0054 HE HAD A DIADEM UPON HIS HEAD AND ABOVE IT A CROWN OF GOLD HE ALSO HAD A SCEPTER IN HIS RIGHT HAND ABOUT THE BIER WERE HIS SONS AND HIS NUMEROUS RELATIONS NEXT TO THESE WAS THE SOLDIERY DISTINGUISHED ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL COUNTRIES AND DENOMINATIONS
5746-48362-0055 AND THEY WERE PUT INTO THE FOLLOWING ORDER FIRST OF ALL WENT HIS GUARDS THEN THE BAND OF THRACIANS AND AFTER THEM THE GERMANS AND NEXT THE BAND OF GALATIANS EVERY ONE IN THEIR HABILIMENTS OF WAR
5746-48362-0056 AND BEHIND THESE MARCHED THE WHOLE ARMY IN THE SAME MANNER AS THEY USED TO GO OUT TO WAR AND AS THEY USED TO BE PUT IN ARRAY BY THEIR MUSTER MASTERS AND CENTURIONS THESE WERE FOLLOWED BY FIVE HUNDRED OF HIS DOMESTICS CARRYING SPICES
5746-48362-0057 FOR THERE BY HIS OWN COMMAND HE WAS TO BE BURIED
5746-48362-0058 FOR SO MANY DAYS ARE APPOINTED FOR IT BY THE LAW OF OUR FATHERS AND WHEN HE HAD GIVEN A TREAT TO THE MULTITUDE AND LEFT OFF HIS MOTORING HE WENT UP INTO THE TEMPLE HE HAD ALSO ACCLAMATIONS AND PRAISES GIVEN HIM
5746-48362-0059 AND RETURNED THEM THANKS THAT THEY DID NOT REMEMBER THE INJURIES HIS FATHER HAD DONE THEM TO HIS DISADVANTAGE
5746-48362-0060 BUT THAT HE SHOULD ABSTAIN AT PRESENT FROM THE NAME OF KING AND THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE HONOR OF THAT DIGNITY IF CAESAR SHOULD CONFIRM AND SETTLE THAT TESTAMENT WHICH HIS FATHER HAD MADE AND THAT IT WAS ON THIS ACCOUNT THAT WHEN THE ARMY WOULD HAVE PUT THE DIADEM ON HIM AT JERICHO
5746-48362-0061 HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT OF THAT HONOR WHICH IS USUALLY SO MUCH DESIRED
5746-48362-0062 ALTHOUGH BY HIS ACCEPTANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT HE SHOULD NOT WANT THE ABILITY OF REWARDING THEIR KINDNESS TO HIM AND THAT IT SHOULD BE HIS ENDEAVOR AS TO ALL THINGS WHEREIN THEY WERE CONCERNED TO PROVE IN EVERY RESPECT BETTER THAN HIS FATHER
5746-48362-0063 BY SO MUCH DID THEY MORE HIGHLY COMMEND HIM AND MADE APPLICATION TO HIM FOR THE GRANT OF WHAT THEY DESIRED SOME MADE A CLAMOR THAT HE WOULD EASE THEM OF SOME OF THEIR ANNUAL PAYMENTS
5746-48362-0064 BUT OTHERS DESIRED HIM TO RELEASE THOSE THAT WERE PUT INTO PRISON BY HEROD WHO WERE MANY AND HAD BEEN PUT THERE AT SEVERAL TIMES OTHERS OF THEM REQUIRED THAT HE WOULD TAKE AWAY THOSE TAXES WHICH HAD BEEN SEVERELY LAID UPON WHAT WAS PUBLICLY SOLD AND BOUGHT
