6098-57837-0000 WHILE PERSHING WAS STILL IN WEST POINT THE INDIAN CHIEF GERONIMO WAS MAKING TROUBLE IN THE SOUTHWEST FOR SEVERAL YEARS HE LED A BAND OF OUTLAW BRAVES WHO TERRORIZED THE SOUTHERN BORDER GENERAL CROOK WAS SENT IN PURSUIT OF HIM
6098-57837-0001 AND AFTERWARDS GENERAL MILES TOOK UP THE CHASE FINALLY IN AUGUST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX THE CHIEF AND HIS FOLLOWERS WERE ROUNDED UP PERSHING GRADUATED IN THE SPRING OF THIS YEAR WITH THE USUAL RANK GIVEN TO GRADUATES SECOND LIEUTENANT
6098-57837-0002 AND WAS IMMEDIATELY ASSIGNED TO DUTY UNDER MILES HE HAD AN INCONSPICUOUS PART IN THE CAPTURE BUT THE NEXT YEAR IN THE SPECIAL MANEUVERS HE WAS PERSONALLY COMPLIMENTED BY THE GENERAL FOR MARCHING HIS TROOPS WITH A PACK TRAIN
6098-57837-0003 AND BRINGING IN EVERY ANIMAL IN GOOD CONDITION DOUBTLESS HIS EARLY EXPERIENCE WITH THE MISSOURI BRAND OF MULE AIDED HIM THEREAFTER FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS PERSHING'S LIFE WAS THAT OF A PLAINSMAN
6098-57837-0004 HE WAS SUCCESSIVELY AT FORT BAYARD FORT STANTON AND FORT WINGATE ALL IN NEW MEXICO IN THE CENTER OF TROUBLED COUNTRY IN EIGHTEEN NINETY HE WAS SHIFTED NORTH TO TAKE THE FIELD AGAINST THE SIOUX INDIANS IN SOUTH DAKOTA
6098-57837-0005 AND IN THE BATTLE OF WOUNDED KNEE HE HAD A CONSIDERABLE TASTE OF BURNT POWDER WHERE THE TRIBE THAT HAD MASSACRED GENERAL CUSTER AND HIS BAND WAS PRACTICALLY WIPED OUT THE NEXT YEAR HE WAS STATIONED AT FORT NIOBRARA IN NEBRASKA
6098-57837-0006 IN COMMAND OF THE SIOUX INDIAN SCOUTS THIS RAPID SUMMARY OF A BUSY AND ADVENTUROUS LIFE ON THE PLAINS DOES NOT CONVEY ANY IDEA OF ITS MANY ACTIVITIES BUT IT WAS AN EXCEEDINGLY VALUABLE PERIOD OF TRAINING TO THE YOUNG OFFICER
6098-57837-0007 HE WAS FINDING HIMSELF AND LEARNING SOMETHING OF THE INNER ART OF MILITARY SCIENCE THAT HE WAS LATER TO PUT TO SUCH GOOD USE HERE IS THE OPINION OF AN OFFICER WHO WAS PERSHING'S SENIOR IN THE SIXTH CAVALRY BY SIX YEARS
6098-57837-0008 ALL OF THEM SPENT IN THE APACHE COUNTRY IN THOSE DAYS WHEN A YOUNGSTER JOINED A REGIMENT HE WAS NOT EXPECTED TO EXPRESS HIMSELF ON MILITARY MATTERS UNTIL HE HAD SOME LITTLE EXPERIENCE
6098-57837-0009 BUT THERE WAS A CERTAIN SOMETHING IN PERSHING'S APPEARANCE AND MANNER WHICH MADE HIM AN EXCEPTION TO THE RULE WITHIN A VERY SHORT TIME AFTER HE CAME TO THE POST A SENIOR OFFICER WOULD TURN TO HIM AND SAY PERSHING WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS
6098-57837-0010 AND HIS OPINION WAS SUCH THAT WE ALWAYS LISTENED TO IT HE WAS QUIET UNOBTRUSIVE IN HIS OPINIONS BUT WHEN ASKED HE ALWAYS WENT TO THE MEAT OF A QUESTION IN A FEW WORDS FROM THE FIRST HE HAD RESPONSIBLE DUTIES THROWN ON HIM
6098-57837-0011 HE WAS GENIAL AND FULL OF FUN NO MATTER WHAT THE WORK OR WHAT THE PLAY HE ALWAYS TOOK A WILLING AND LEADING PART HE WORKED HARD AND HE PLAYED HARD BUT WHENEVER HE HAD WORK TO DO HE NEVER LET PLAY INTERFERE WITH IT
6098-57837-0012 HIS EXPERIENCES IN THE WILD WEST AND IT WAS THE WILD WEST IN THOSE DAYS CANNOT BE PASSED OVER WITHOUT RELATING ONE TYPICAL ANECDOTE THREE CATTLE RUSTLERS WHITE MEN HAD GOTTEN INTO A FIGHT WITH THE ZUNI INDIANS
6098-57837-0013 WHO CAUGHT THEM DRIVING OFF SOME CATTLE THREE OF THE RED MEN WERE KILLED BEFORE THE OUTLAWS WERE FINALLY SURROUNDED IN A LONELY CABIN WORD WAS SENT OF THEIR PREDICAMENT TO THE NEAREST FORT AND LIEUTENANT PERSHING WAS SENT WITH A SMALL DETACHMENT TO THEIR RESCUE
6098-57837-0014 HE RODE STRAIGHT UP TO THE ZUNI CHIEF WHO WAS NOW ON THE WARPATH AND TOLD HIM HE MUST CALL OFF HIS BRAVES THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WOULD PUNISH THESE MEN THE CHIEF FINALLY GRUNTED ASSENT
6098-57837-0015 AND PERSHING STRODE FORWARD ALONE INTO THE CLEARING AND APPROACHED THE CABIN AT ANY TIME A SHOT MIGHT HAVE COME OUT BUT DISREGARDING HIS OWN DANGER HE WENT ON
6098-57837-0016 AND FOUND HIMSELF LOOKING INTO THE MUZZLES OF THREE GUNS A SINGLE FALSE MOVE ON HIS PART WOULD PROBABLY HAVE ENDED HIM BUT HE DID NOT WAVER HE FOLDED HIS ARMS AND SAID QUIETLY WELL BOYS I'VE COME TO GET YOU
6098-57837-0017 THE OUTLAWS LAUGHED NOISILY AND SWORE BY WAY OF REPLY YOU MIGHT AS WELL COME ALONG HE WENT ON WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE MY MEN ARE POSTED ALL AROUND THIS CABIN MORE PROFANITY
6098-57837-0018 THE NEXT DUTY WHICH FELL TO LIEUTENANT PERSHING WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM CHASING INDIANS AND OUTLAWS ON THE PLAINS HE WAS ASSIGNED TO THE TASK OF PUTTING SOME HALF BAKED CADETS THROUGH THEIR PACES IN SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE
6098-57837-0019 HE BECAME PROFESSOR OF MILITARY SCIENCE AND TACTICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA THE DISCIPLINE AT THIS SCHOOL WAS OF A PIECE WITH THAT OF OTHER STATE COLLEGES
6098-57837-0020 GIVES A HUMOROUS ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENED IT WAS THE GENERAL BELIEF THAT THE STUDENTS IN THESE WESTERN COLLEGES MANY OF THEM FARMERS SONS COULD NEVER BE TAUGHT THE WEST POINT IDEA
6098-57837-0021 RECOGNIZED THE SAME QUALITIES WHEN HE SAW THEM BY GEORGE I'VE GOT THE FINEST MATERIAL IN THE WORLD HE TOLD THE CHANCELLOR HIS STEEL LIKE EYES ALIGHT WITH ENTHUSIASM YOU COULD DO ANYTHING WITH THOSE BOYS THEY'VE GOT THE STUFF IN THEM WATCH ME GET IT OUT
6098-57837-0022 AND HE PROCEEDED TO DO SO BY THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRST WINTER THE BATTALION WAS IN SHAPE TO DRILL TOGETHER MOREOVER THE BOYS HAD MADE A NICKNAME FOR THEIR LEADER AND NICKNAMES MEAN A GREAT DEAL IN STUDENT LIFE HE WAS UNIVERSALLY CALLED THE LIEUT
6098-57837-0023 PRONOUNCED LOOT OF COURSE IN THE REAL AMERICAN ACCENT AS THOUGH THERE WERE BUT ONE LIEUTENANT IN THE WORLD THIS HE WAS CALLED BEHIND HIS BACK OF COURSE TO HIS FACE THEY CALLED HIM SIR A TITLE OF RESPECT WHICH THEY HAD NEVER THOUGHT TO GIVE TO ANY MAN ALIVE
6098-57837-0024 BY THE END OF THAT FIRST ACADEMIC YEAR EVERY MAN UNDER HIM WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED THE LIEUT STRAIGHT INTO A PRAIRIE FIRE AND WOULD HAVE KEPT STEP WHILE DOING IT AS HE GRADUALLY GOT HIS GROUP OF OFFICERS LICKED INTO SHAPE HE FOUND LESS TO DO PERSONALLY
6098-57837-0025 SO HE PROMPTLY COMPLAINED TO THE CHANCELLOR TO THIS EFFECT AND ASKED LIKE OLIVER TWIST FOR MORE AFTER A MOMENT'S STUPEFACTION THE LIEUT WAS THEN DOING FIVE TIMES THE WORK THAT ANY OFFICER BEFORE HIM HAD EVER DONE
6098-57837-0026 WITHOUT CHANGING HIS STRIDE IN THE LEAST THE YOUNG OFFICER SWEPT THESE TWO OCCUPATIONS ALONG WITH HIM BOUGHT SOME CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND A DERBY HAT
6098-57837-0027 WHERE HE WAS ALSO MILITARY ATTACHE DURING THE NEXT TWO YEARS HE ATE UP THE LAW COURSE WITH A FIERY HASTE WHICH RAISED THE DEGREE OF CLASS WORK TO FEVER HEAT
6098-57837-0028 FOUND THE EXPERIENCE IMMENSELY STIMULATING OF COURSE HE GRADUATED AND WAS THUS ENTITLED TO WRITE ANOTHER TITLE AFTER HIS NAME THAT OF BACHELOR OF ARTS ABOUT THIS TIME ALSO HE WAS PROMOTED TO A FIRST LIEUTENANCY
6098-57837-0029 THE FIRST OFFICIAL RECOGNITION FOR HIS MANY LONG MONTHS OF WORK THEN HE WAS SENT BACK TO THE FIELD AGAIN
6098-57837-0030 NEXT CAME A WELCOME COMMAND TO TAKE THE POSITION OF ASSISTANT INSTRUCTOR OF TACTICS AT WEST POINT IT WAS ALMOST LIKE GETTING BACK HOME TO SEE THESE LOVED HILLS THE MIGHTY RIVER AND THE FAMILIAR BARRACKS AGAIN
6098-57837-0031 BUT AFTER A FEW MONTHS HERE THE SPANISH WAR BROKE OUT EAGER TO GET INTO THE ACTION HE RESIGNED HIS POSITION AT THE MILITARY ACADEMY AND WAS TRANSFERRED TO HIS FORMER REGIMENT THE TENTH CAVALRY
6098-57837-0032 THIS REGIMENT WAS SENT IMMEDIATELY TO SANTIAGO AND TOOK PART IN THE SHORT BUT SPIRITED FIGHTING AT EL CANEY AND SAN JUAN HILL WHERE A CERTAIN COLONEL OF THE ROUGH RIDERS WAS IN EVIDENCE
6098-57837-0033 SIDE BY SIDE THESE TWO CRACK REGIMENTS CHARGED UP THE SLOPE DOMINATED BY THE SPANISH FORT AND HERE ROOSEVELT AND PERSHING FIRST MET WE WOULD LIKE TO FANCY THESE TWO INTREPID SOLDIERS AS RECOGNIZING EACH OTHER HERE IN THE DIN OF BATTLE
6098-57837-0034 BUT THE TRUTH IS SOMETIMES MORE PROSAIC THAN FICTION AND THE TRUTH COMPELS US TO REPRINT THIS LITTLE ANECDOTE FROM THE WORLD'S WORK FIVE YEARS AFTER THE SPANISH WAR WHEN ROOSEVELT WAS PRESIDENT AND PERSHING WAS A MERE CAPTAIN
6098-57837-0035 HE WAS INVITED TO LUNCHEON AT THE WHITE HOUSE CAPTAIN PERSHING SAID THE PRESIDENT WHEN THE PARTY WAS SEATED AT THE TABLE DID I EVER MEET YOU IN THE SANTIAGO CAMPAIGN YES MISTER PRESIDENT JUST ONCE WHEN WAS THAT WHAT DID I SAY
6098-57837-0036 TO GET SUPPLIES FOR THE MEN THE NIGHT WAS PITCH BLACK AND IT WAS RAINING TORRENTS THE ROAD WAS A STREAK OF MUD ON THE WAY BACK TO THE FRONT I HEARD NOISE AND CONFUSION AHEAD I KNEW IT WAS A MIRED MULE TEAM AN OFFICER IN THE UNIFORM OF A ROUGH RIDER
6098-57837-0037 WAS TRYING TO GET THE MULES OUT OF THE MUD AND HIS REMARKS AS I SAID A MOMENT AGO SHOULD NOT BE QUOTED BEFORE THE LADIES I SUGGESTED THAT THE BEST THING TO DO WAS TO TAKE MY MULES AND PULL YOUR WAGON OUT AND THEN GET YOUR MULES OUT THIS WAS DONE AND WE SALUTED AND PARTED
6098-57837-0038 WELL SAID ROOSEVELT IF THERE EVER WAS A TIME WHEN A MAN WOULD BE JUSTIFIED IN USING BAD LANGUAGE IT WOULD BE IN THE MIDDLE OF A RAINY NIGHT WITH HIS MULES DOWN IN THE MUD AND HIS WAGON LOADED WITH THINGS SOLDIERS AT THE FRONT NEEDED PERSHING
6098-57837-0039 AS A RESULT OF THE CUBAN CAMPAIGN WAS TWICE RECOMMENDED FOR BREVET COMMISSIONS FOR PERSONAL BRAVERY AND UNTIRING ENERGY AND FAITHFULNESS GENERAL BALDWIN SAID OF HIM PERSHING IS THE COOLEST MAN UNDER FIRE I EVER SAW
6098-57837-0040 HE HAD NOW BEEN TRANSFERRED AT HIS OWN REQUEST TO THE PHILIPPINES WHETHER OR NOT HE WON PROMOTION THROUGH THE SLOW MOVING MACHINERY OF THE WAR OFFICE HIS ENERGETIC SPIRIT DEMANDED ACTION
6098-57837-0041 THE SOLDIER'S DUTY IS TO GO WHEREVER THERE IS FIGHTING HE SAID AND VIGOROUSLY OPPOSED THE IDEA THAT HE BE GIVEN A SWIVEL CHAIR JOB HIS FIRST TERM OF SERVICE IN THE PHILIPPINES WAS FROM EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE TO NINETEEN O THREE
6098-57837-0042 OF TICKETING EVERY MAN IN THE SERVICE AS TO HIS FUTURE VALUE TO THE ARMY AND PERSHING WAS MAKING GOOD HE HAD TURNED FORTY BEFORE HE WAS CAPTAIN OUT IN THE PHILIPPINES HE WORKED UP TO A MAJOR
6098-57837-0043 NOW ADVANCEMENT WAS TO FOLLOW WITH A STARTLING JUMP IT ALL HINGED UPON THAT LUNCHEON WITH ROOSEVELT ABOUT WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD AND THE FACT THAT ROOSEVELT HAD A CHARACTERISTIC WAY OF DOING THINGS
6098-57837-0044 THE STEP HE NOW TOOK WAS NOT A PIECE OF FAVORITISM TOWARD PERSHING IT AROSE FROM A DESIRE TO HAVE THE MOST EFFICIENT MEN AT THE HEAD OF THE ARMY PERSHING WAS NOMINATED FOR BRIGADIER GENERAL AND THE NOMINATION WAS CONFIRMED
6098-57837-0045 HE PERFORMED AN INVALUABLE SERVICE IN BRINGING PEACE TO THIS TROUBLED DISTRICT HE ACCOMPLISHED THIS PARTLY BY FORCE OF ARMS PARTLY BY PERSUASION THE LITTLE BROWN MEN FOUND IN THIS BIG AMERICANO A MAN WITH WHOM THEY COULD NOT TRIFLE
6098-57837-0046 AND ALSO ONE ON WHOSE WORD THEY COULD RELY IT WAS NOT UNTIL NINETEEN FOURTEEN THAT HE WAS RECALLED FROM THE PHILIPPINES AND THEN VERY SHORTLY WAS SENT ACROSS THE MEXICAN BORDER
6098-57837-0047 IT WOULD SEEM AS THOUGH THIS STRONG SOLDIER WAS TO HAVE NO REST THAT HIS MUSCLES WERE TO BE KEPT CONSTANTLY INURED TO HARDSHIP SO THAT IN THE EVENT OF A GREATER CALL TO ARMS HERE WOULD BE ONE COMMANDER TRAINED TO THE MINUTE
6098-57837-0048 THE FATES HAD INDEED BEEN SHAPING PERSHING FROM BOYHOOD
6098-57837-0049 THE PUNITIVE EXPEDITION INTO MEXICO WAS A CASE IN POINT IT WAS A THANKLESS JOB AT BEST AND FULL OF HARDSHIP AND DANGER A DAY'S MARCH OF THIRTY MILES ACROSS AN ALKALI DESERT UNDER A BLAZING SUN IS HARDLY A PLEASURE JAUNT
6098-57837-0050 AND THERE WERE MANY SUCH DURING THOSE TROUBLED MONTHS OF NINETEEN SIXTEEN THEN ONE DAY CAME A QUIET MESSAGE FROM WASHINGTON ASKING GENERAL PERSHING TO REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT THE RESULTS OF THAT INTERVIEW WERE MOMENTOUS
6098-57837-0051 THE GREAT WAR IN EUROPE WAS DEMANDING THE INTERVENTION OF AMERICA OUR TROOPS WERE TO BE SENT ACROSS THE SEAS TO EUROPE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THE GOVERNMENT NEEDED A MAN UPON WHOM IT COULD ABSOLUTELY RELY TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF
6098-57837-0052 OF THE EXPEDITIONARY FORCES WOULD GENERAL PERSHING HOLD HIMSELF IN READINESS FOR THIS SUPREME TASK THE VETERAN OF THIRTY YEARS OF CONSTANT CAMPAIGNING STIFFENED TO ATTENTION THE EAGER LOOK OF BATTLE BATTLE FOR THE RIGHT
6098-57837-0053 SHONE IN HIS EYE EVERY LINE OF HIS UPSTANDING FIGURE DENOTED CONFIDENCE A CONFIDENCE THAT WAS TO INSPIRE ALL AMERICA AND THEN THE WORLD ITSELF IN THIS CHOICE OF LEADER HE SALUTED I WILL DO MY DUTY SIR HE SAID
