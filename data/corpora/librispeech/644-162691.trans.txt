644-162691-0000 THE FLORENTINES MURMUR AGAINST THOSE WHO HAD BEEN ADVOCATES OF THE WAR
644-162691-0001 MEASURES FOR THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR ATTEMPT OF THE HIGHER CLASSES TO DEPRIVE THE PLEBEIANS OF THEIR SHARE IN THE GOVERNMENT
644-162691-0002 RINALDO DEGLI ALBIZZI ADDRESSES AN ASSEMBLY OF CITIZENS AND ADVISES THE RESTORATION OF THE GRANDI
644-162691-0003 BUT NONE FELT IT SO SEVERELY AS THE NOBILITY WHO HAD BEEN IN FAVOR OF THE WAR FOR THEY PERCEIVED THEIR ENEMIES TO BE INSPIRITED AND THEMSELVES DISARMED WITHOUT FRIENDS AND OPPOSED BY THE PEOPLE
644-162691-0004 WHO AT THE CORNERS OF STREETS INSULTED THEM WITH SARCASTIC EXPRESSIONS COMPLAINING OF THE HEAVY TAXES AND THE UNNECESSARY WAR AND SAYING OH THEY APPOINTED THE TEN TO FRIGHTEN THE ENEMY HAVE THEY RELIEVED FURLI
644-162691-0005 BUT TO AGGRANDIZE THEIR OWN POWER WHICH GOD HAS VERY JUSTLY ABATED THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ENTERPRISE BY MANY A ONE WITH WHICH THEY HAVE OPPRESSED THE CITY
644-162691-0006 TO WHOM WILL THEY FLEE FOR ASSISTANCE NOW TO POPE MARTIN WHOM THEY RIDICULED BEFORE THE FACE OF BRACCIO OR TO QUEEN GIOVANNA WHOM THEY ABANDONED
644-162691-0007 TO THESE REPROACHES WAS ADDED ALL THAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM AN ENRAGED MULTITUDE SEEING THE DISCONTENT SO PREVALENT
644-162691-0008 THE ELDEST SON OF MASO WHO BY HIS OWN TALENTS AND THE RESPECT HE DERIVED FROM THE MEMORY OF HIS FATHER ASPIRED TO THE FIRST OFFICES IN THE GOVERNMENT
644-162691-0009 SHOWING THAT IT IS NOT RIGHT TO JUDGE OF ACTIONS MERELY BY THEIR EFFECTS FOR IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT WHAT HAS BEEN VERY MATURELY CONSIDERED IS ATTENDED WITH UNFAVORABLE RESULTS
644-162691-0010 THAT IF WE ARE TO APPLAUD EVIL COUNSELS BECAUSE THEY ARE SOMETIMES FOLLOWED BY FORTUNATE EVENTS WE SHOULD ONLY ENCOURAGE MEN IN ERROR WHICH WOULD BRING GREAT MISCHIEF UPON THE REPUBLIC
644-162691-0011 IN THE SAME WAY IT WOULD BE WRONG TO BLAME A WISE RESOLUTION
644-162691-0012 THEIR LOSS WOULD BE STILL GREATER IF THEY ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE DEJECTED BUT IF THEY SET A BOLD FRONT AGAINST ADVERSITY AND MADE GOOD USE OF THE MEANS WITHIN THEIR POWER
644-162691-0013 THEY WOULD NOT BE SENSIBLE OF THEIR LOSS OR THE DUKE OF HIS VICTORY HE ASSURED THEM THEY OUGHT NOT TO BE ALARMED BY IMPENDING EXPENSES AND CONSEQUENT TAXATION BECAUSE THE LATTER MIGHT BE REDUCED
644-162691-0014 AND THE FUTURE EXPENSE WOULD NOT BE SO GREAT AS THE FORMER HAD BEEN FOR LESS PREPARATION IS NECESSARY FOR THOSE ENGAGED IN SELF DEFENSE THAN FOR THOSE WHO DESIGN TO ATTACK OTHERS
644-162691-0015 HE ADVISED THEM TO IMITATE THE CONDUCT OF THEIR FOREFATHERS WHO BY COURAGEOUS CONDUCT IN ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES HAD DEFENDED THEMSELVES AGAINST ALL THEIR ENEMIES
644-162691-0016 THUS ENCOURAGED THE CITIZENS ENGAGED COUNT ODDO THE SON OF BRACCIO AND UNITED WITH HIM FOR DIRECTING THE OPERATIONS OF THE WAR
644-162691-0017 TO THESE THEY ADDED OTHER LEADERS AND REMOUNTED SOME OF THOSE WHO HAD LOST THEIR HORSES IN THE LATE DEFEAT THEY ALSO APPOINTED TWENTY CITIZENS TO LEVY NEW TAXES
644-162691-0018 TOOK COURAGE AND DRAINED THEM WITHOUT MERCY
644-162691-0019 WHO AT FIRST IN ORDER TO CONCILIATE DID NOT COMPLAIN OF THEIR OWN PARTICULAR HARDSHIPS
644-162691-0020 AND ADVISED THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE IN THE WAY OF RELIEF BUT THEIR ADVICE WAS REJECTED IN THE COUNCILS THEREFORE TO RENDER THE LAW AS OFFENSIVE AS POSSIBLE
644-162691-0021 AND TO MAKE ALL SENSIBLE OF ITS INJUSTICE THEY CONTRIVED THAT THE TAXES SHOULD BE LEVIED WITH THE UTMOST RIGOR AND MADE IT LAWFUL TO KILL ANY THAT MIGHT RESIST THE OFFICERS EMPLOYED TO COLLECT THEM
644-162691-0022 HENCE FOLLOWED MANY LAMENTABLE COLLISIONS
644-162691-0023 IT BEGAN TO BE THE IMPRESSION OF ALL THAT ARMS WOULD BE RESORTED TO AND ALL PRUDENT PERSONS APPREHENDED SOME APPROACHING EVIL
644-162691-0024 COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE USED LIKE DOGS AND THE REST WERE DESIROUS THAT THE TAXATION SHOULD BE EQUALIZED
644-162691-0025 THAT SOME ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE TO RECOVER THE GOVERNMENT SINCE THEIR WANT OF VIGILANCE HAD ENCOURAGED MEN TO CENSURE PUBLIC ACTIONS AND ALLOWED THOSE TO INTERFERE IN AFFAIRS
644-162691-0026 WHO HAD HITHERTO BEEN MERELY THE LEADERS OF THE RABBLE HAVING REPEATEDLY DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT THEY RESOLVED TO MEET AGAIN AT AN APPOINTED HOUR
644-162691-0027 WITH THE PERMISSION OF LORENZO RIDOLFI AND FRANCESCO GIANFIGLIAZZI
644-162691-0028 GIOVANNI DE MEDICI WAS NOT AMONG THEM EITHER BECAUSE BEING UNDER SUSPICION HE WAS NOT INVITED OR THAT ENTERTAINING DIFFERENT VIEWS HE WAS UNWILLING TO INTERFERE
644-162691-0029 DESCRIBING THE CONDITION OF THE CITY AND SHOWING HOW BY THEIR OWN NEGLIGENCE IT HAD AGAIN FALLEN UNDER THE POWER OF THE PLEBEIANS FROM WHOM IT HAD BEEN WRESTED BY THEIR FATHERS IN THIRTEEN EIGHTY ONE
644-162691-0030 HE REMINDED THEM OF THE INIQUITY OF THE GOVERNMENT WHICH WAS IN POWER FROM THIRTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
644-162691-0031 SOME A FATHER OTHERS A GRANDFATHER PUT TO DEATH BY ITS TYRANNY HE ASSURED THEM THEY WERE NOW IN THE SAME DANGER AND THAT THE CITY WAS SINKING UNDER THE SAME DISORDERS
644-162691-0032 AND WOULD SOON IF NOT RESTRAINED BY GREATER FORCE OR BETTER REGULATIONS APPOINT THE MAGISTRATES WHO
644-162691-0033 AND OVERTURN THE GOVERNMENT WHICH FOR FORTY TWO YEARS HAD RULED THE CITY WITH SO MUCH GLORY THE CITIZENS WOULD THEN BE SUBJECT TO THE WILL OF THE MULTITUDE AND LIVE DISORDERLY AND DANGEROUS
644-162691-0034 OR BE UNDER THE COMMAND OF SOME INDIVIDUAL WHO MIGHT MAKE HIMSELF PRINCE FOR THESE REASONS HE WAS OF OPINION THAT WHOEVER LOVED HIS COUNTRY AND HIS HONOR MUST AROUSE HIMSELF AND CALL TO MIND
644-162691-0035 WHO BY THE RUIN OF THE ALBERTI RESCUED THE CITY FROM THE DANGERS THEN IMPENDING AND THAT THE CAUSE OF THE AUDACITY NOW ASSUMED BY THE MULTITUDE WAS THE EXTENSIVE SQUITTINI OR POLLINGS WHICH BY THEIR NEGLIGENCE
644-162691-0036 WERE ALLOWED TO BE MADE FOR THUS THE PALACE HAD BECOME FILLED WITH LOW MEN HE THEREFORE CONCLUDED THAT THE ONLY MEANS OF REMEDYING THE EVIL WAS TO RESTORE THE GOVERNMENT TO THE NOBILITY
644-162691-0037 BY REDUCING THE COMPANIES FROM FOURTEEN TO SEVEN
644-162691-0038 BOTH BY THE REDUCTION IN THEIR NUMBER AND BY INCREASING THE AUTHORITY OF THE GREAT WHO ON ACCOUNT OF FORMER ENMITIES WOULD BE DISINCLINED TO FAVOR THEM HE ADDED THAT IT IS A GOOD THING
644-162691-0039 THAT NOW THE GREAT HAVING BEEN HUMBLED AND THE PLEBEIANS BECOME INSOLENT IT WAS WELL TO RESTRAIN THE INSOLENCE OF THE LATTER BY THE ASSISTANCE OF THE FORMER TO EFFECT THIS THEY MIGHT PROCEED EITHER OPENLY
644-162691-0040 OR OTHERWISE FOR SOME OF THEM BELONGING TO THE COUNCIL OF TEN FORCES MIGHT BE LED INTO THE CITY WITHOUT EXCITING OBSERVATION RINALDO WAS MUCH APPLAUDED
644-162691-0041 AND HIS ADVICE WAS APPROVED OF BY THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY
644-162691-0042 ALL THAT RINALDO HAD ADVANCED WAS CORRECT AND THE REMEDIES HE PROPOSED GOOD AND CERTAIN IF THEY COULD BE ADOPTED WITHOUT AN ABSOLUTE DIVISION OF THE CITY AND THIS HE HAD NO DOUBT
644-162691-0043 BUT THAT IF HE DID NOT CONCUR WITH THEM THEY COULD DO NOTHING WITHOUT ARMS AND THAT WITH THEM THEY WOULD INCUR THE RISK OF BEING VANQUISHED OR OF NOT BEING ABLE TO REAP THE FRUIT OF VICTORY
644-162691-0044 HE THEN MODESTLY REMINDED THEM OF WHAT HE HAD SAID UPON A FORMER OCCASION AND OF THEIR RELUCTANCE TO REMEDY THE EVIL WHEN IT MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN DONE
644-162691-0045 THAT NOW THE SAME REMEDY COULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED WITHOUT INCURRING THE DANGER OF GREATER EVILS AND THEREFORE THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR THEM TO DO
644-162691-0046 AND TRY IF HE COULD INDUCE HIM TO JOIN THEM HE UNDERTOOK THIS COMMISSION AND IN THE MOST PREVAILING WORDS HE COULD MAKE USE OF
644-162691-0047 ENABLE THEM TO COMPLETE THE RUIN BOTH OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CITY TO THIS GIOVANNI REPLIED THAT HE CONSIDERED IT THE DUTY OF A GOOD AND WISE CITIZEN TO AVOID ALTERING THE INSTITUTIONS
644-162691-0048 TO WHICH A CITY IS ACCUSTOMED THERE BEING NOTHING SO INJURIOUS TO THE PEOPLE AS SUCH A CHANGE FOR MANY ARE NECESSARILY OFFENDED AND WHERE THERE ARE SEVERAL DISCONTENTED
644-162691-0049 MAY BE CONSTANTLY APPREHENDED HE SAID IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT THEIR RESOLUTION WOULD HAVE TWO EXCEEDINGLY PERNICIOUS EFFECTS THE ONE CONFERRING HONORS ON THOSE WHO HAVING NEVER POSSESSED THEM
644-162691-0050 ESTEEMED THEM THE LESS AND THEREFORE HAD THE LESS OCCASION TO GRIEVE FOR THEIR ABSENCE THE OTHER TAKING THEM FROM THOSE WHO BEING ACCUSTOMED TO THEIR POSSESSION
644-162691-0051 IT WOULD THUS BE EVIDENT THAT THE INJURY DONE TO ONE PARTY
644-162691-0052 HE WOULD GAIN FEW FRIENDS AND MAKE MANY ENEMIES
644-162691-0053 WHILE THE FORMER BRINGS ALIKE GRATIFICATION AND PROFIT THEN DIRECTING HIS DISCOURSE MORE PARTICULARLY TO RINALDO HE SAID
