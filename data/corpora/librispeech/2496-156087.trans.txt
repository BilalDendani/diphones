2496-156087-0000 MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE
2496-156087-0001 I HAVE ANOTHER LETTER FROM MISTER LOVELACE ALTHOUGH I HAD NOT ANSWERED HIS FORMER THIS MAN SOMEHOW OR OTHER KNOWS EVERY THING THAT PASSES IN OUR FAMILY
2496-156087-0002 MY CONFINEMENT HANNA'S DISMISSION AND MORE OF THE RESENTMENTS AND RESOLUTIONS OF MY FATHER UNCLES AND BROTHER THAN I CAN POSSIBLY KNOW AND ALMOST AS SOON AS THE THINGS HAPPEN WHICH HE TELLS ME OF
2496-156087-0003 HE CANNOT COME AT THESE INTELLIGENCIES FAIRLY HE IS EXCESSIVELY UNEASY UPON WHAT HE HEARS AND HIS EXPRESSIONS BOTH OF LOVE TO ME AND RESENTMENT TO THEM ARE VERY FERVENT HE SOLICITS ME
2496-156087-0004 TO ENGAGE MY HONOUR TO HIM NEVER TO HAVE MISTER SOLMES I THINK I MAY FAIRLY PROMISE HIM THAT I WILL NOT HE BEGS
2496-156087-0005 THAT HE IS PERPETUALLY REPROACHED FOR NOT RESENTING IT AND THAT AS WELL BY LORD M AND LADY SARAH AND LADY BETTY AS BY ALL HIS OTHER FRIENDS AND IF HE MUST HAVE NO HOPE FROM ME
2496-156087-0006 HE CANNOT ANSWER FOR WHAT HIS DESPAIR WILL MAKE HIM DO INDEED HE SAYS HIS RELATIONS THE LADIES PARTICULARLY ADVISE HIM TO HAVE RECOURSE TO A LEGAL REMEDY BUT HOW HE ASKS CAN A MAN OF HONOUR
2496-156087-0007 HE IS FULL OF THE FAVOURS OF THE LADIES OF HIS FAMILY TO ME TO WHOM NEVERTHELESS I AM PERSONALLY A STRANGER EXCEPT THAT I ONCE SAW MISS PATTY MONTAGUE AT MISSUS KNOLLY'S
2496-156087-0008 IT IS NATURAL I BELIEVE FOR A PERSON TO BE THE MORE DESIROUS OF MAKING NEW FRIENDS
2496-156087-0009 YET HAD I RATHER APPEAR AMIABLE IN THE EYES OF MY OWN RELATIONS AND IN YOUR EYES
2496-156087-0010 BUT THESE FOUR LADIES OF HIS FAMILY HAVE SUCH EXCELLENT CHARACTERS THAT ONE CANNOT BUT WISH TO BE THOUGHT WELL OF BY THEM CANNOT THERE BE A WAY TO FIND OUT
2496-156087-0011 OR BY MISTER HICKMAN WHO HAS SOME KNOWLEDGE OF LORD M COVERTLY HOWEVER WHAT THEIR OPINIONS ARE OF THE PRESENT SITUATION OF THINGS IN OUR FAMILY AND OF THE LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THERE IS THAT EVER THE ALLIANCE ONCE APPROVED OF BY THEM
2496-156087-0012 CAN TAKE EFFECT I CANNOT FOR MY OWN PART THINK SO WELL OF MYSELF AS TO IMAGINE THAT THEY CAN WISH THEIR KINSMAN TO PERSEVERE IN HIS VIEWS WITH REGARD TO ME THROUGH SUCH CONTEMPTS AND DISCOURAGEMENTS
2496-156087-0013 NOT THAT IT WOULD CONCERN ME SHOULD THEY ADVISE HIM TO THE CONTRARY BY MY LORD'S SIGNING MISTER LOVELACE'S FORMER LETTER BY MISTER LOVELACE'S ASSURANCES OF THE CONTINUED FAVOUR OF ALL HIS RELATIONS AND BY THE REPORT OF OTHERS
2496-156087-0014 I SEEM STILL TO STAND HIGH IN THEIR FAVOUR BUT METHINKS I SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE THIS CONFIRMED TO ME AS FROM THEMSELVES BY THE LIPS OF AN INDIFFERENT PERSON AND THE RATHER BECAUSE OF THEIR FORTUNES AND FAMILY
2496-156087-0015 AND TAKE IT AMISS AS THEY HAVE REASON TO BE INCLUDED BY OURS IN THE CONTEMPT THROWN UPON THEIR KINSMAN CURIOSITY AT PRESENT IS ALL MY MOTIVE
2496-156087-0016 NOTWITHSTANDING YOUR QUESTIONABLE THROBS EVEN WERE THE MERITS OF MISTER LOVELACE MUCH GREATER THAN THEY ARE I HAVE ANSWERED HIS LETTERS IF HE TAKES ME AT MY WORD
2496-156087-0017 I SHALL NEED TO BE LESS SOLICITOUS FOR THE OPINIONS OF HIS RELATIONS IN MY FAVOUR AND YET ONE WOULD BE GLAD TO BE WELL THOUGHT OF BY THE WORTHY THIS IS THE SUBSTANCE OF MY LETTER
2496-156087-0018 I EXPRESS MY SURPRISE AT HIS KNOWING AND SO EARLY ALL THAT PASSES HERE I ASSURE HIM
2496-156087-0019 I WOULD NOT HAVE MISTER SOLMES I TELL HIM THAT TO RETURN AS I UNDERSTAND HE DOES DEFIANCES FOR DEFIANCES TO MY RELATIONS IS FAR FROM BEING A PROOF WITH ME EITHER OF HIS POLITENESS
2496-156087-0020 THAT THE MOMENT I HEAR HE VISITS ANY OF MY FRIENDS WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT I WILL MAKE A RESOLUTION NEVER TO SEE HIM MORE IF I CAN HELP IT I APPRIZE HIM
2496-156087-0021 THAT MISTER WYERLEY AND OTHER GENTLEMEN KNEW IT TO BE MY CHOICE BEFORE HIMSELF WAS ACQUAINTED WITH ANY OF US THAT I HAD NEVER BEEN INDUCED TO RECEIVE A LINE FROM HIM ON THE SUBJECT
2496-156087-0022 I SHOULD HAVE VERY GREAT OBJECTIONS TO HIM WERE I TO GET OVER MY CHOICE OF A SINGLE LIFE SO REALLY PREFERABLE TO ME AS IT IS AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE DECLARED AS MUCH TO HIM HAD I NOT REGARDED HIM AS MORE THAN A COMMON VISITER
2496-156087-0023 MAY BE THE VERY LAST AND THAT ONLY TO ACQUAINT ME WITH HIS ACQUIESCENCE THAT IT SHALL BE SO AT LEAST TILL HAPPIER TIMES THIS LAST I PUT IN THAT HE MAY NOT BE QUITE DESPERATE
2496-156087-0024 BUT IF HE TAKE ME AT MY WORD I SHALL BE RID OF ONE OF MY TORMENTORS I HAVE PROMISED TO LAY BEFORE YOU ALL HIS LETTERS AND MY ANSWERS I REPEAT THAT PROMISE AND AM THE LESS SOLICITOUS
2496-156087-0025 FOR THAT REASON TO AMPLIFY UPON THE CONTENTS OF EITHER BUT I CANNOT TOO OFTEN EXPRESS MY VEXATION TO BE DRIVEN TO SUCH STREIGHTS AND DIFFICULTIES HERE AT HOME AS OBLIGE ME TO ANSWER LETTERS FROM A MAN
2496-156087-0026 I HAD NOT ABSOLUTELY INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE AND TO WHOM I HAD REALLY GREAT OBJECTIONS FILLED AS HIS ARE WITH SUCH WARM PROTESTATIONS AND WRITTEN TO ME WITH A SPIRIT OF EXPECTATION FOR MY DEAR
2496-156087-0027 YOU NEVER KNEW SO BOLD A SUPPOSER AS COMMENTATORS FIND BEAUTIES IN AN AUTHOR TO WHICH THE AUTHOR PERHAPS WAS A STRANGER SO HE SOMETIMES COMPLIMENTS ME IN HIGH STRAINS OF GRATITUDE FOR FAVOURS AND FOR A CONSIDERATION
2496-156087-0028 THE ATTRIBUTED GOODNESS TO HIM WHICH IF I SHEWED I SHOULD HAVE THE LESS OPINION OF MYSELF IN SHORT MY DEAR LIKE A RESTIFF HORSE AS I HAVE HEARD DESCRIBED BY SPORTSMEN HE PAINS ONE'S HANDS
2496-156087-0029 AND HALF DISJOINTS ONE'S ARMS TO REIN HIM IN AND WHEN YOU SEE HIS LETTERS YOU MUST FORM NO JUDGMENT UPON THEM TILL YOU HAVE READ MY ANSWERS IF YOU DO YOU WILL INDEED THINK YOU HAVE CAUSE TO ATTRIBUTE SELF DECEIT
2496-156087-0030 AND THROBS AND GLOWS TO YOUR FRIEND AND YET AT OTHER TIMES THE CONTRADICTORY NATURE COMPLAINS THAT I SHEW HIM AS LITTLE FAVOUR AND MY FRIENDS AS MUCH
2496-156087-0031 HE HAD BEEN THE AGGRESSOR AND AS IF THE CATASTROPHE HAD BEEN AS FATAL AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF HE HAS A DESIGN BY THIS CONDUCT SOMETIMES COMPLAINING OF MY SHYNESS AT OTHERS EXALTING IN MY IMAGINARY FAVOURS
2496-156087-0032 TO INDUCE ME AT ONE TIME TO ACQUIESCE WITH HIS COMPLIMENTS AT ANOTHER TO BE MORE COMPLAISANT FOR HIS COMPLAINTS AND IF THE CONTRADICTION BE NOT THE EFFECT OF HIS INATTENTION AND GIDDINESS I SHALL THINK HIM AS DEEP AND AS ARTFUL TOO PROBABLY AS PRACTISED
