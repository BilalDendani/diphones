4116-13256-0000 SAID ONE OF THE GIRLS WITH A NERVOUS LAUGH
4116-13256-0001 THERE'S NO DANGER SAID VIRGINIA BRIEFLY IS IT TRUE THAT YOUR BROTHER ROLLIN HAS BEEN CONVERTED ASKED THE FIRST SPEAKER LOOKING AT VIRGINIA CURIOUSLY IT IMPRESSED HER DURING THE DRIVE TO THE RECTANGLE THAT ALL THREE OF HER FRIENDS WERE REGARDING HER WITH CLOSE ATTENTION
4116-13256-0002 AS IF SHE WERE PECULIAR YES HE CERTAINLY IS
4116-13256-0003 TALKING WITH HIS OLD FRIENDS THERE TRYING TO PREACH TO THEM DOESN'T THAT SEEM FUNNY SAID THE GIRL WITH THE RED SILK PARASOL VIRGINIA DID NOT ANSWER
4116-13256-0004 AS THEY NEARED THE DISTRICT THEY GREW MORE AND MORE NERVOUS THE SIGHTS AND SMELLS AND SOUNDS WHICH HAD BECOME FAMILIAR TO VIRGINIA STRUCK THE SENSES OF THESE REFINED DELICATE SOCIETY GIRLS AS SOMETHING HORRIBLE AS THEY ENTERED FARTHER INTO THE DISTRICT
4116-13256-0005 AT THIS FINE CARRIAGE WITH ITS LOAD OF FASHIONABLY DRESSED YOUNG WOMEN SLUMMING HAD NEVER BEEN A FAD WITH RAYMOND SOCIETY AND THIS WAS PERHAPS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE TWO HAD COME TOGETHER IN THIS WAY THE GIRLS FELT THAT INSTEAD OF SEEING THE RECTANGLE
4116-13256-0006 THEY WERE BEING MADE THE OBJECTS OF CURIOSITY THEY WERE FRIGHTENED AND DISGUSTED LET'S GO BACK I'VE SEEN ENOUGH SAID THE GIRL WHO WAS SITTING WITH VIRGINIA THEY WERE AT THAT MOMENT JUST OPPOSITE A NOTORIOUS SALOON AND GAMBLING HOUSE
4116-13256-0007 THE STREET WAS NARROW AND THE SIDEWALK CROWDED SUDDENLY OUT OF THE DOOR OF THIS SALOON A YOUNG WOMAN REELED SHE WAS SINGING IN A BROKEN DRUNKEN SOB
4116-13256-0008 JUST AS I AM WITHOUT ONE PLEA AND AS THE CARRIAGE ROLLED PAST SHE LEERED AT IT RAISING HER FACE SO THAT VIRGINIA SAW IT VERY CLOSE TO HER OWN IT WAS THE FACE OF THE GIRL WHO HAD KNEELED SOBBING THAT NIGHT WITH VIRGINIA KNEELING BESIDE HER AND PRAYING FOR HER
4116-13256-0009 STOP CRIED VIRGINIA MOTIONING TO THE DRIVER WHO WAS LOOKING AROUND THE CARRIAGE STOPPED AND IN A MOMENT SHE WAS OUT AND HAD GONE UP TO THE GIRL AND TAKEN HER BY THE ARM LOREEN SHE SAID AND THAT WAS ALL THE GIRL LOOKED INTO HER FACE
4116-13256-0010 THE GIRLS IN THE CARRIAGE WERE SMITTEN INTO HELPLESS ASTONISHMENT THE SALOON KEEPER HAD COME TO THE DOOR OF THE SALOON AND WAS STANDING THERE LOOKING ON WITH HIS HANDS ON HIS HIPS AND THE RECTANGLE FROM ITS WINDOWS ITS SALOON STEPS ITS FILTHY SIDEWALK GUTTER AND ROADWAY PAUSED
4116-13256-0011 AND WITH UNDISGUISED WONDER STARED AT THE TWO GIRLS OVER THE SCENE THE WARM SUN OF SPRING POURED ITS MELLOW LIGHT A FAINT BREATH OF MUSIC FROM THE BAND STAND IN THE PARK FLOATED INTO THE RECTANGLE THE CONCERT HAD BEGUN
4116-13256-0012 AND THE FASHION AND WEALTH OF RAYMOND WERE DISPLAYING THEMSELVES UP TOWN ON THE BOULEVARD WHEN VIRGINIA LEFT THE CARRIAGE AND WENT UP TO LOREEN SHE HAD NO DEFINITE IDEA AS TO WHAT SHE WOULD DO OR WHAT THE RESULT OF HER ACTION WOULD BE
4116-13256-0013 SHE SIMPLY SAW A SOUL THAT HAD TASTED OF THE JOY OF A BETTER LIFE
4116-13256-0014 WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THAT QUESTION WAS BECOMING WITH HER AS WITH MANY OTHERS A HABIT OF LIFE SHE LOOKED AROUND NOW AS SHE STOOD CLOSE BY LOREEN AND THE WHOLE SCENE WAS CRUELLY VIVID TO HER
4116-13256-0015 DRIVE ON DON'T WAIT FOR ME I AM GOING TO SEE MY FRIEND HOME SHE SAID CALMLY ENOUGH THE GIRL WITH THE RED PARASOL SEEMED TO GASP AT THE WORD FRIEND WHEN VIRGINIA SPOKE IT SHE DID NOT SAY ANYTHING THE OTHER GIRLS SEEMED SPEECHLESS GO ON
4116-13256-0016 I CANNOT GO BACK WITH YOU SAID VIRGINIA THE DRIVER STARTED THE HORSES SLOWLY ONE OF THE GIRLS LEANED A LITTLE OUT OF THE CARRIAGE CAN'T WE
4116-13256-0017 DO YOU WANT OUR HELP COULDN'T YOU NO NO EXCLAIMED VIRGINIA YOU CANNOT BE OF ANY HELP TO ME THE CARRIAGE MOVED ON AND VIRGINIA WAS ALONE WITH HER CHARGE SHE LOOKED UP AND AROUND MANY FACES IN THE CROWD WERE SYMPATHETIC
4116-13256-0018 THE HOLY SPIRIT HAD SOFTENED A GOOD DEAL OF THE RECTANGLE WHERE DOES SHE LIVE ASKED VIRGINIA NO ONE ANSWERED IT OCCURRED TO VIRGINIA AFTERWARD WHEN SHE HAD TIME TO THINK IT OVER
4116-13256-0019 THAT THE RECTANGLE SHOWED A DELICACY IN ITS SAD SILENCE THAT WOULD HAVE DONE CREDIT TO THE BOULEVARD FOR THE FIRST TIME IT FLASHED ACROSS HER
4116-13256-0020 HAD NO PLACE THAT COULD BE CALLED HOME THE GIRL SUDDENLY WRENCHED HER ARM FROM VIRGINIA'S GRASP IN DOING SO SHE NEARLY THREW VIRGINIA DOWN YOU SHALL NOT TOUCH ME LEAVE ME LET ME GO TO HELL THAT'S WHERE I BELONG
4116-13256-0021 THE DEVIL IS WAITING FOR ME SEE HIM SHE EXCLAIMED HOARSELY SHE TURNED AND POINTED WITH A SHAKING FINGER AT THE SALOON KEEPER THE CROWD LAUGHED VIRGINIA STEPPED UP TO HER AND PUT HER ARM ABOUT HER LOREEN SHE SAID FIRMLY COME WITH ME
4116-13256-0022 YOU DO NOT BELONG TO HELL YOU BELONG TO JESUS AND HE WILL SAVE YOU COME THE GIRL SUDDENLY BURST INTO TEARS SHE WAS ONLY PARTLY SOBERED BY THE SHOCK OF MEETING VIRGINIA VIRGINIA LOOKED AROUND AGAIN WHERE DOES MISTER GRAY LIVE SHE ASKED
4116-13256-0023 SHE KNEW THAT THE EVANGELIST BOARDED SOMEWHERE NEAR THE TENT A NUMBER OF VOICES GAVE THE DIRECTION COME LOREEN I WANT YOU TO GO WITH ME TO MISTER GRAY'S SHE SAID
4116-13256-0024 WHO MOANED AND SOBBED AND NOW CLUNG TO HER AS FIRMLY AS BEFORE SHE HAD REPULSED HER SO THE TWO MOVED ON THROUGH THE RECTANGLE TOWARD THE EVANGELIST'S LODGING PLACE THE SIGHT SEEMED TO IMPRESS THE RECTANGLE SERIOUSLY
4116-13256-0025 IT NEVER TOOK ITSELF SERIOUSLY WHEN IT WAS DRUNK BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE RICHEST MOST BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED GIRLS IN ALL RAYMOND WAS TAKING CARE OF ONE OF THE RECTANGLE'S MOST NOTED CHARACTERS WHO REELED ALONG UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LIQUOR
4116-13256-0026 WAS A FACT ASTOUNDING ENOUGH TO THROW MORE OR LESS DIGNITY AND IMPORTANCE ABOUT LOREEN HERSELF THE EVENT OF LOREEN'S STUMBLING THROUGH THE GUTTER DEAD DRUNK ALWAYS MADE THE RECTANGLE LAUGH AND JEST
4116-13256-0027 BUT LOREEN STAGGERING ALONG WITH A YOUNG LADY FROM THE SOCIETY CIRCLES UPTOWN SUPPORTING HER WAS ANOTHER THING THE RECTANGLE VIEWED IT WITH SOBERNESS AND MORE OR LESS WONDERING ADMIRATION
4116-13256-0028 OR FIND SOME SAFE PLACE FOR HER UNTIL SHE WAS SOBER SHE STOOD NOW AT THE DOOR AFTER THE WOMAN HAD SPOKEN AND SHE WAS REALLY AT A LOSS TO KNOW WHAT TO DO LOREEN SANK DOWN STUPIDLY ON THE STEPS AND BURIED HER FACE IN HER ARMS
4116-13256-0029 VIRGINIA EYED THE MISERABLE FIGURE OF THE GIRL WITH A FEELING THAT SHE WAS AFRAID WOULD GROW INTO DISGUST FINALLY A THOUGHT POSSESSED HER THAT SHE COULD NOT ESCAPE WHAT WAS TO HINDER HER FROM TAKING LOREEN HOME WITH HER WHY SHOULD NOT THIS HOMELESS WRETCHED CREATURE
4116-13256-0030 REEKING WITH THE FUMES OF LIQUOR BE CARED FOR IN VIRGINIA'S OWN HOME INSTEAD OF BEING CONSIGNED TO STRANGERS IN SOME HOSPITAL OR HOUSE OF CHARITY VIRGINIA REALLY KNEW VERY LITTLE ABOUT ANY SUCH PLACES OF REFUGE AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE WERE TWO OR THREE SUCH INSTITUTIONS IN RAYMOND BUT
4116-13256-0031 IT IS DOUBTFUL IF ANY OF THEM WOULD HAVE TAKEN A PERSON LIKE LOREEN IN HER PRESENT CONDITION BUT THAT WAS NOT THE QUESTION WITH VIRGINIA JUST NOW WHAT WOULD JESUS DO WITH LOREEN THAT WAS WHAT VIRGINIA FACED
4116-13256-0032 WE WILL TAKE THE CAR HERE AT THE CORNER LOREEN STAGGERED TO HER FEET AND TO VIRGINIA'S SURPRISE MADE NO TROUBLE SHE HAD EXPECTED RESISTANCE OR A STUBBORN REFUSAL TO MOVE WHEN THEY REACHED THE CORNER AND TOOK THE CAR IT WAS NEARLY FULL OF PEOPLE GOING UPTOWN
4116-13256-0033 VIRGINIA WAS PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE STARE THAT GREETED HER AND HER COMPANION AS THEY ENTERED BUT HER THOUGHT WAS DIRECTED MORE AND MORE TO THE APPROACHING SCENE WITH HER GRANDMOTHER WHAT WOULD MADAM PAGE SAY LOREEN WAS NEARLY SOBER NOW BUT SHE WAS LAPSING INTO A STATE OF STUPOR
4116-13256-0034 VIRGINIA WAS OBLIGED TO HOLD FAST TO HER ARM SEVERAL TIMES THE GIRL LURCHED HEAVILY AGAINST HER
4116-13256-0035 BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF EVEN IN THE FACE OF THE INTERVIEW WITH THE GRANDMOTHER AND WHEN THE DOOR SHUT AND SHE WAS IN THE WIDE HALL WITH HER HOMELESS OUTCAST SHE FELT EQUAL TO ANYTHING THAT MIGHT NOW COME MADAM PAGE WAS IN THE LIBRARY HEARING VIRGINIA COME IN SHE CAME INTO THE HALL
4116-13256-0036 GRANDMOTHER VIRGINIA SPOKE WITHOUT HESITATION AND VERY CLEARLY I HAVE BROUGHT ONE OF MY FRIENDS FROM THE RECTANGLE SHE IS IN TROUBLE AND HAS NO HOME I AM GOING TO CARE FOR HER HERE A LITTLE WHILE
4116-13256-0037 MADAM PAGE GLANCED FROM HER GRANDDAUGHTER TO LOREEN IN ASTONISHMENT
4116-13256-0038 SHE ASKED IN A COLD SNEERING VOICE THAT HURT VIRGINIA MORE THAN ANYTHING SHE HAD YET FELT YES I SAID SO VIRGINIA'S FACE FLUSHED BUT SHE SEEMED TO RECALL A VERSE THAT MISTER GRAY HAD USED FOR ONE OF HIS RECENT SERMONS
4116-13256-0039 A FRIEND OF PUBLICANS AND SINNERS SURELY JESUS WOULD DO THIS THAT SHE WAS DOING DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS GIRL IS ASKED MADAM PAGE IN AN ANGRY WHISPER STEPPING NEAR VIRGINIA I KNOW VERY WELL
4116-13256-0040 IT EVEN BETTER THAN YOU DO SHE IS DRUNK AT THIS MINUTE BUT SHE IS ALSO A CHILD OF GOD I HAVE SEEN HER ON HER KNEES REPENTANT AND I HAVE SEEN HELL REACH OUT ITS HORRIBLE FINGERS AFTER HER AGAIN AND BY THE GRACE OF CHRIST
4116-13256-0041 GRANDMOTHER WE CALL OURSELVES CHRISTIANS HERE IS A POOR LOST HUMAN CREATURE WITHOUT A HOME SLIPPING BACK INTO A LIFE OF MISERY AND POSSIBLY ETERNAL LOSS
4116-13256-0042 WHAT WOULD VIRGINIA'S ACTION COST THE FAMILY IN THE WAY OF CRITICISM AND LOSS OF STANDING AND ALL THAT LONG LIST OF NECESSARY RELATIONS WHICH PEOPLE OF WEALTH AND POSITION MUST SUSTAIN TO THE LEADERS OF SOCIETY
4116-13256-0043 TO MADAM PAGE SOCIETY REPRESENTED MORE THAN THE CHURCH OR ANY OTHER INSTITUTION IT WAS A POWER TO BE FEARED AND OBEYED THE LOSS OF ITS GOOD WILL WAS A LOSS MORE TO BE DREADED THAN ANYTHING EXCEPT THE LOSS OF WEALTH ITSELF SHE STOOD ERECT AND STERN
4116-13256-0044 AND CONFRONTED VIRGINIA FULLY ROUSED AND DETERMINED VIRGINIA PLACED HER ARM ABOUT LOREEN AND CALMLY LOOKED HER GRANDMOTHER IN THE FACE YOU SHALL NOT DO THIS VIRGINIA YOU CAN SEND HER TO THE ASYLUM FOR HELPLESS WOMEN WE CAN PAY ALL THE EXPENSES
4116-13256-0045 WE CANNOT AFFORD FOR THE SAKE OF OUR REPUTATIONS TO SHELTER SUCH A PERSON GRANDMOTHER I DO NOT WISH TO DO ANYTHING THAT IS DISPLEASING TO YOU BUT I MUST KEEP LOREEN HERE TONIGHT AND LONGER IF IT SEEMS BEST THEN
4116-13256-0046 YOU CAN ANSWER FOR THE CONSEQUENCES I DO NOT STAY IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH A MISERABLE MADAM PAGE LOST HER SELF CONTROL VIRGINIA STOPPED HER BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK THE NEXT WORD GRANDMOTHER THIS HOUSE IS MINE
4116-13256-0047 IT IS YOUR HOME WITH ME AS LONG AS YOU CHOOSE TO REMAIN BUT IN THIS MATTER I MUST ACT AS I FULLY BELIEVE JESUS WOULD IN MY PLACE I AM WILLING TO BEAR ALL THAT SOCIETY MAY SAY OR DO SOCIETY IS NOT MY GOD BY THE SIDE OF THIS POOR SOUL
4116-13256-0048 I SHALL NOT STAY HERE THEN SAID MADAM PAGE SHE TURNED SUDDENLY AND WALKED TO THE END OF THE HALL SHE THEN CAME BACK AND GOING UP TO VIRGINIA SAID WITH AN EMPHASIS THAT REVEALED HER INTENSIVE EXCITEMENT OF PASSION
4116-13256-0049 YOU CAN ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE DRIVEN YOUR GRANDMOTHER OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN FAVOR OF A DRUNKEN WOMAN THEN WITHOUT WAITING FOR VIRGINIA TO REPLY SHE TURNED AGAIN AND WENT UPSTAIRS VIRGINIA CALLED A SERVANT AND SOON HAD LOREEN CARED FOR
4116-13256-0050 SHE WAS FAST LAPSING INTO A WRETCHED CONDITION
