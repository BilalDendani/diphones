6087-50469-0000 ALTHOUGH THE MOST LEGITIMATE WAS THAT OF THE WORTHY OLD BARON WHO WAS ONLY DISTRESSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE COMMON CAUSE WE SHALL HARDLY SAID HE ONE MORNING TO WAVERLEY WHEN THEY HAD BEEN VIEWING THE CASTLE
6087-50469-0001 WHICH TAKES ROOT WITHIN THE PLACE BESIEGED OR IT MAY BE OF THE HERB WOODBIND PARIETARIA OR PELLITORY WE SHALL NOT I SAY GAIN IT BY THIS SAME BLOCKADE OR LEAGUER OF EDINBURGH CASTLE
6087-50469-0002 FOR THIS OPINION HE GAVE MOST LEARNED AND SATISFACTORY REASONS THAT THE READER MAY NOT CARE TO HEAR REPEATED HAVING ESCAPED FROM THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAVERLEY WENT TO FERGUS'S LODGINGS BY APPOINTMENT TO AWAIT HIS RETURN FROM HOLYROOD HOUSE
6087-50469-0003 I AM TO HAVE A PARTICULAR AUDIENCE TO MORROW SAID FERGUS TO WAVERLEY OVERNIGHT AND YOU MUST MEET ME TO WISH ME JOY OF THE SUCCESS WHICH I SECURELY ANTICIPATE
6087-50469-0004 THE MORROW CAME AND IN THE CHIEF'S APARTMENT HE FOUND ENSIGN MACCOMBICH WAITING TO MAKE REPORT OF HIS TURN OF DUTY IN A SORT OF DITCH WHICH THEY HAD DUG ACROSS THE CASTLE HILL AND CALLED A TRENCH
6087-50469-0005 IN A SHORT TIME THE CHIEF'S VOICE WAS HEARD ON THE STAIR IN A TONE OF IMPATIENT FURY CALLUM WHY CALLUM BEG DIAOUL HE ENTERED THE ROOM WITH ALL THE MARKS OF A MAN AGITATED BY A TOWERING PASSION
6087-50469-0006 AND THERE WERE FEW UPON WHOSE FEATURES RAGE PRODUCED A MORE VIOLENT EFFECT THE VEINS OF HIS FOREHEAD SWELLED WHEN HE WAS IN SUCH AGITATION HIS NOSTRIL BECAME DILATED HIS CHEEK AND EYE INFLAMED AND HISLOOK THAT OF A DEMONIAC
6087-50469-0007 THESE APPEARANCES OF HALF SUPPRESSED RAGE WERE THE MORE FRIGHTFUL BECAUSE THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY CAUSED BY A STRONG EFFORT TO TEMPER WITH DISCRETION AN ALMOST UNGOVERNABLE PAROXYSM OF PASSION AND RESULTED FROM AN INTERNAL CONFLICT OF THE MOST DREADFUL KIND
6087-50469-0008 WHICH AGITATED HIS WHOLE FRAME OF MORTALITY AS HE ENTERED THE APARTMENT HE UNBUCKLED HIS BROADSWORD AND THROWING IT DOWN WITH SUCH VIOLENCE THAT THE WEAPON ROLLED TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM I KNOW NOT WHAT HE EXCLAIMED
6087-50469-0009 WITHHOLDS ME FROM TAKING A SOLEMN OATH THAT I WILL NEVER MORE DRAW IT IN HIS CAUSE LOAD MY PISTOLS CALLUM AND BRING THEM HITHER INSTANTLY INSTANTLY CALLUM WHOM NOTHING EVER STARTLED DISMAYED OR DISCONCERTED
6087-50469-0010 OBEYED VERY COOLLY EVAN DHU UPON WHOSE BROW THE SUSPICION THAT HIS CHIEF HAD BEEN INSULTED CALLED UP A CORRESPONDING STORM SWELLED IN SULLEN SILENCE AWAITING TO LEARN WHERE OR UPON WHOM VENGEANCE WAS TO DESCEND
6087-50469-0011 SO WAVERLEY YOU ARE THERE SAID THE CHIEF AFTER A MOMENT'S RECOLLECTION YES I REMEMBER I ASKED YOU TO SHARE MY TRIUMPH AND YOU HAVE COME TO WITNESS MY DISAPPOINTMENT WE SHALL CALL IT EVAN NOW PRESENTED THE WRITTEN REPORT HE HAD IN HIS HAND
6087-50469-0012 WHICH FERGUS THREW FROM HIM WITH GREAT PASSION I WISH TO GOD HE SAID THE OLD DEN WOULD TUMBLE DOWN UPON THE HEADS OF THE FOOLS WHO ATTACK AND THE KNAVES WHO DEFEND IT I SEE WAVERLEY YOU THINK I AM MAD LEAVE US EVAN BUT BE WITHIN CALL
6087-50469-0013 THE COLONEL'S IN AN UNCO KIPPAGE SAID MISSUS FLOCKHART TO EVAN AS HE DESCENDED I WISH HE MAY BE WEEL THE VERY VEINS ON HIS BRENT BROW ARE SWELLED LIKE WHIPCORD
6087-50469-0014 WHEN THIS OFFICER LEFT THE ROOM THE CHIEFTAIN GRADUALLY REASSUMED SOME DEGREE OF COMPOSURE I KNOW WAVERLEY HE SAID THAT COLONEL TALBOT HAS PERSUADED YOU TO CURSE TEN TIMES A DAY YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH US NAY NEVER DENY IT
6087-50469-0015 FOR I AM AT THIS MOMENT TEMPTED TO CURSE MY OWN WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT I MADE THIS VERY MORNING TWO SUITS TO THE PRINCE AND HE HAS REJECTED THEM BOTH WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT WHAT CAN I THINK ANSWERED WAVERLEY TILL I KNOW WHAT YOUR REQUESTS WERE
6087-50469-0016 WHY WHAT SIGNIFIES WHAT THEY WERE MAN I TELL YOU IT WAS I THAT MADE THEM I TO WHOM HE OWES MORE THAN TO ANY THREE WHO HAVE JOINED THE STANDARD FOR I NEGOTIATED THE WHOLE BUSINESS AND BROUGHT IN ALL THE PERTHSHIRE MEN WHEN NOT ONE WOULD HAVE STIRRED
6087-50469-0017 I AM NOT LIKELY I THINK TO ASK ANYTHING VERY UNREASONABLE AND IF I DID THEY MIGHT HAVE STRETCHED A POINT WELL BUT YOU SHALL KNOW ALL NOW THAT I CAN DRAW MY BREATH AGAIN WITH SOME FREEDOM YOU REMEMBER MY EARL'S PATENT IT IS DATED SOME YEARS BACK
6087-50469-0018 FOR SERVICES THEN RENDERED AND CERTAINLY MY MERIT HAS NOT BEEN DIMINISHED TO SAY THE LEAST BY MY SUBSEQUENT BEHAVIOUR NOW SIR I VALUE THIS BAUBLE OF A CORONET AS LITTLE AS YOU CAN OR ANY PHILOSOPHER ON EARTH
6087-50469-0019 FOR I HOLD THAT THE CHIEF OF SUCH A CLAN AS THE SLIOCHD NAN IVOR IS SUPERIOR IN RANK TO ANY EARL IN SCOTLAND BUT I HAD A PARTICULAR REASON FOR ASSUMING THIS CURSED TITLE AT THIS TIME
6087-50469-0020 YOU MUST KNOW THAT I LEARNED ACCIDENTALLY THAT THE PRINCE HAS BEEN PRESSING THAT OLD FOOLISH BARON OF BRADWARDINE TO DISINHERIT HIS MALE HEIR OR NINETEENTH OR TWENTIETH COUSIN WHO HAS TAKEN A COMMAND IN THE ELECTOR OF HANOVER'S MILITIA
6087-50469-0021 AND TO SETTLE HIS ESTATE UPON YOUR PRETTY LITTLE FRIEND ROSE AND THIS AS BEING THE COMMAND OF HIS KING AND OVERLORD
6087-50469-0022 THE OLD GENTLEMAN SEEMS WELL RECONCILED TO AND WHAT BECOMES OF THE HOMAGE CURSE THE HOMAGE I BELIEVE ROSE IS TO PULL OFF THE QUEEN'S SLIPPER ON HER CORONATION DAY OR SOME SUCH TRASH
6087-50469-0023 WELL SIR AS ROSE BRADWARDINE WOULD ALWAYS HAVE MADE A SUITABLE MATCH FOR ME BUT FOR THIS IDIOTICAL PREDILECTION OF HER FATHER FOR THE HEIR MALE
6087-50469-0024 AND WHICH OF COURSE WOULD SUPERSEDE THAT DIFFICULTY
6087-50469-0025 I COULD HAVE NO OBJECTION BUT FERGUS SAID WAVERLEY I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU HAD ANY AFFECTION FOR MISS BRADWARDINE AND YOU ARE ALWAYS SNEERING AT HER FATHER I HAVE AS MUCH AFFECTION FOR MISS BRADWARDINE MY GOOD FRIEND
6087-50469-0026 AS I THINK IT NECESSARY TO HAVE FOR THE FUTURE MISTRESS OF MY FAMILY AND THE MOTHER OF MY CHILDREN SHE IS A VERY PRETTY INTELLIGENT GIRL AND IS CERTAINLY OF ONE OF THE VERY FIRST LOWLAND FAMILIES AND WITH A LITTLE OF FLORA'S INSTRUCTIONS AND FORMING
6087-50469-0027 WILL MAKE A VERY GOOD FIGURE AS TO HER FATHER HE IS AN ORIGINAL IT IS TRUE AND AN ABSURD ONE ENOUGH BUT HE HAS GIVEN SUCH SEVERE LESSONS TO SIR HEW HALBERT THAT DEAR DEFUNCT THE LAIRD OF BALMAWHAPPLE AND OTHERS
6087-50469-0028 THAT NOBODY DARE LAUGH AT HIM SO HIS ABSURDITY GOES FOR NOTHING I TELL YOU THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NO EARTHLY OBJECTION NONE I HAD SETTLED THE THING ENTIRELY IN MY OWN MIND BUT HAD YOU ASKED THE BARON'S CONSENT SAID WAVERLEY OR ROSE'S
6087-50469-0029 TO WHAT PURPOSE TO HAVE SPOKE TO THE BARON BEFORE I HAD ASSUMED MY TITLE WOULD HAVE ONLY PROVOKED A PREMATURE AND IRRITATING DISCUSSION ON THE SUBJECT OF THE CHANGE OF NAME WHEN AS EARL OF GLENNAQUOICH I HAD ONLY TO PROPOSE TO HIM
6087-50469-0030 OR IN A SCUTCHEON OF PRETENCE OR IN A SEPARATE SHIELD PERHAPS ANY WAY THAT WOULD NOT BLEMISH MY OWN COAT OF ARMS AND AS TO ROSE I DON'T SEE WHAT OBJECTION SHE COULD HAVE MADE IF HER FATHER WAS SATISFIED PERHAPS THE SAME THAT YOUR SISTER MAKES TO ME YOU BEING SATISFIED
6087-50469-0031 FERGUS GAVE A BROAD STARE AT THE COMPARISON WHICH THIS SUPPOSITION IMPLIED BUT CAUTIOUSLY SUPPRESSED THE ANSWER WHICH ROSE TO HIS TONGUE O WE SHOULD EASILY HAVE ARRANGED ALL THAT SO SIR I CRAVED A PRIVATE INTERVIEW AND THIS MORNING WAS ASSIGNED
6087-50469-0032 AND I ASKED YOU TO MEET ME HERE THINKING LIKE A FOOL THAT I SHOULD WANT YOUR COUNTENANCE AS BRIDE'S MAN WELL I STATE MY PRETENSION THEY ARE NOT DENIED THE PROMISES SO REPEATEDLY MADE AND THE PATENT GRANTED THEY ARE ACKNOWLEDGED
6087-50469-0033 BUT I PROPOSE AS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE TO ASSUME THE RANK WHICH THE PATENT BESTOWED I HAVE THE OLD STORY OF THE JEALOUSY OF C AND M TRUMPED UP AGAINST ME I RESIST THIS PRETEXT AND OFFER TO PROCURE THEIR WRITTEN ACQUIESCENCE
6087-50469-0034 IN VIRTUE OF THE DATE OF MY PATENT AS PRIOR TO THEIR SILLY CLAIMS I ASSURE YOU I WOULD HAVE HAD SUCH A CONSENT FROM THEM IF IT HAD BEEN AT THE POINT OF THE SWORD AND THEN OUT COMES THE REAL TRUTH AND HE DARES TO TELL ME TO MY FACE
6087-50469-0035 THAT MY PATENT MUST BE SUPPRESSED FOR THE PRESENT FOR FEAR OF DISGUSTING THAT RASCALLY COWARD AND FAINEANT NAMING THE RIVAL CHIEF OF HIS OWN CLAN WHO HAS NO BETTER TITLE TO BE A CHIEFTAIN THAN I TO BE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND WHO IS PLEASED TO SHELTER HIS DASTARDLY RELUCTANCE
6087-50469-0036 TO COME OUT AGREEABLE TO HIS PROMISE TWENTY TIMES PLEDGED UNDER A PRETENDED JEALOUSY OF THE PRINCE'S PARTIALITY TO ME AND TO LEAVE THIS MISERABLE DRIVELLER WITHOUT A PRETENCE FOR HIS COWARDICE THE PRINCE ASKS IT AS A PERSONAL FAVOUR OF ME FORSOOTH
6087-50469-0037 NOT TO PRESS MY JUST AND REASONABLE REQUEST AT THIS MOMENT AFTER THIS PUT YOUR FAITH IN PRINCES AND DID YOUR AUDIENCE END HERE END O NO I WAS DETERMINED TO LEAVE HIM NO PRETENCE FOR HIS INGRATITUDE
6087-50469-0038 AND I THEREFORE STATED WITH ALL THE COMPOSURE I COULD MUSTER FOR I PROMISE YOU I TREMBLED WITH PASSION THE PARTICULAR REASONS I HAD FOR WISHING THAT HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS WOULD IMPOSE UPON ME ANY OTHER MODE OF EXHIBITING MY DUTY AND DEVOTION
6087-50469-0039 AS MY VIEWS IN LIFE MADE WHAT AT ANY OTHER TIME WOULD HAVE BEEN A MERE TRIFLE AT THIS CRISIS A SEVERE SACRIFICE AND THEN I EXPLAINED TO HIM MY FULL PLAN AND WHAT DID THE PRINCE ANSWER
6087-50469-0040 WHY IT IS WELL IT IS WRITTEN CURSE NOT THE KING NO NOT IN THY THOUGHT WHY HE ANSWERED THAT TRULY HE WAS GLAD I HAD MADE HIM MY CONFIDANT TO PREVENT MORE GRIEVOUS DISAPPOINTMENT FOR HE COULD ASSURE ME UPON THE WORD OF A PRINCE
6087-50469-0041 THAT MISS BRADWARDINE'S AFFECTIONS WERE ENGAGED AND HE WAS UNDER A PARTICULAR PROMISE TO FAVOUR THEM SO MY DEAR FERGUS SAID HE WITH HIS MOST GRACIOUS CAST OF SMILE
