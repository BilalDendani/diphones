4856-20410-0000 PREOCCUPIED AS I WAS BY THE CONDITION OF THE PATIENT THE PROFESSIONAL HABIT OF RAPID AND CLOSE OBSERVATION CAUSED ME TO DIRECT A SEARCHING GLANCE AT THE MAN BEFORE ME IT WAS ONLY A BRIEF GLANCE FOR MISTER WEISS
4856-20410-0001 BETWEEN THE PALLOR OF HIS FACE AND THE REDNESS OF HIS NOSE AND BY THE PECULIAR STIFF BRISTLY CHARACTER OF HIS EYEBROWS BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER FACT AND A VERY CURIOUS ONE
4856-20410-0002 THAT WAS OBSERVED BY ME SUBCONSCIOUSLY AND INSTANTLY FORGOTTEN TO BE REVIVED LATER WHEN I REFLECTED ON THE EVENTS OF THE NIGHT IT WAS THIS AS MISTER WEISS STOOD WITH HIS HEAD SLIGHTLY TURNED
4856-20410-0003 I WAS ABLE TO LOOK THROUGH ONE GLASS OF HIS SPECTACLES AT THE WALL BEYOND ON THE WALL WAS A FRAMED PRINT AND THE EDGE OF THE FRAME SEEN THROUGH THE SPECTACLE GLASS APPEARED QUITE UNALTERED AND FREE FROM DISTORTION MAGNIFICATION OR REDUCTION
4856-20410-0004 AS IF SEEN THROUGH PLAIN WINDOW GLASS AND YET THE REFLECTIONS OF THE CANDLE FLAME IN THE SPECTACLES SHOWED THE FLAME UPSIDE DOWN PROVING CONCLUSIVELY THAT THE GLASSES WERE CONCAVE ON ONE SURFACE AT LEAST
4856-20410-0005 THE STRANGE PHENOMENON WAS VISIBLE ONLY FOR A MOMENT OR TWO AND AS IT PASSED OUT OF MY SIGHT IT PASSED ALSO OUT OF MY MIND NO I SAID REPLYING TO THE LAST QUESTION
4856-20410-0006 I CAN THINK OF NO WAY IN WHICH HE COULD HAVE EFFECTUALLY HIDDEN A STORE OF MORPHINE JUDGING BY THE SYMPTOMS HE HAS TAKEN A LARGE DOSE AND IF HE HAS BEEN IN THE HABIT OF CONSUMING LARGE QUANTITIES HIS STOCK WOULD BE PRETTY BULKY
4856-20410-0007 I SUPPOSE YOU CONSIDER HIM QUITE OUT OF DANGER NOW
4856-20410-0008 I THINK WE CAN PULL HIM ROUND IF WE PERSEVERE BUT HE MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO SINK BACK INTO A STATE OF COMA
4856-20410-0009 IF YOU WILL PUT HIM INTO HIS DRESSING GOWN WE WILL WALK HIM UP AND DOWN THE ROOM FOR A WHILE BUT IS THAT SAFE MISTER WEISS ASKED ANXIOUSLY QUITE SAFE I ANSWERED I WILL WATCH HIS PULSE CAREFULLY
4856-20410-0010 WITH OBVIOUS UNWILLINGNESS AND DISAPPROVAL MISTER WEISS PRODUCED A DRESSING GOWN AND TOGETHER WE INVESTED THE PATIENT IN IT THEN WE DRAGGED HIM VERY LIMP BUT NOT ENTIRELY UNRESISTING OUT OF BED AND STOOD HIM ON HIS FEET
4856-20410-0011 AND MUMBLED A FEW UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS OF PROTEST REGARDLESS OF WHICH WE THRUST HIS FEET INTO SLIPPERS AND ENDEAVOURED TO MAKE HIM WALK AT FIRST HE SEEMED UNABLE TO STAND
4856-20410-0012 AND WE HAD TO SUPPORT HIM BY HIS ARMS AS WE URGED HIM FORWARD BUT PRESENTLY HIS TRAILING LEGS BEGAN TO MAKE DEFINITE WALKING MOVEMENTS AND AFTER ONE OR TWO TURNS UP AND DOWN THE ROOM HE WAS NOT ONLY ABLE PARTLY TO SUPPORT HIS WEIGHT
4856-20410-0013 I WILL GO NOW AND ATTEND TO SOME RATHER IMPORTANT BUSINESS THAT I HAVE HAD TO LEAVE UNFINISHED MISSUS SCHALLIBAUM WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU ALL THE ASSISTANCE THAT YOU REQUIRE AND WILL ORDER THE CARRIAGE WHEN YOU THINK IT SAFE TO LEAVE THE PATIENT IN CASE I SHOULD NOT SEE YOU AGAIN
4856-20410-0014 I WILL SAY GOOD NIGHT I HOPE YOU WON'T THINK ME VERY UNCEREMONIOUS HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING ME AS I HAVE SAID PROFOUNDLY ASTONISHED THAT HE SHOULD CONSIDER ANY BUSINESS
4856-20410-0015 OF MORE MOMENT THAN THE CONDITION OF HIS FRIEND WHOSE LIFE EVEN NOW WAS BUT HANGING BY A THREAD HOWEVER IT WAS REALLY NO CONCERN OF MINE I COULD DO WITHOUT HIM AND THE RESUSCITATION OF THIS UNFORTUNATE HALF DEAD MAN
4856-20410-0016 GAVE ME OCCUPATION ENOUGH TO ENGROSS MY WHOLE ATTENTION THE MELANCHOLY PROGRESS UP AND DOWN THE ROOM RE COMMENCED AND WITH IT THE MUMBLED PROTESTS FROM THE PATIENT AS WE WALKED AND ESPECIALLY AS WE TURNED
4856-20410-0017 I CAUGHT FREQUENT GLIMPSES OF THE HOUSEKEEPER'S FACE BUT IT WAS NEARLY ALWAYS IN PROFILE
4856-20410-0018 AND ON EACH OF THESE OCCASIONS HER EYES WERE DIRECTED AT ME IN A NORMAL MANNER WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF A SQUINT NEVERTHELESS I HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT WHEN HER FACE WAS TURNED AWAY FROM ME SHE SQUINTED
4856-20410-0019 THE SWIVEL EYE THE LEFT WAS TOWARDS ME AS SHE HELD THE PATIENT'S RIGHT ARM AND IT WAS ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY TURNED IN MY DIRECTION
4856-20410-0020 THOUGH OF COURSE HER RIGHT EYE WAS INVISIBLE TO ME IT STRUCK ME EVEN AT THE TIME AS AN ODD AFFAIR BUT I WAS TOO MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT MY CHARGE TO GIVE IT MUCH CONSIDERATION MEANWHILE THE PATIENT CONTINUED TO REVIVE APACE
4856-20410-0021 AND THE MORE HE REVIVED THE MORE ENERGETICALLY DID HE PROTEST AGAINST THIS WEARISOME PERAMBULATION BUT HE WAS EVIDENTLY A POLITE GENTLEMAN FOR MUDDLED AS HIS FACULTIES WERE HE MANAGED TO CLOTHE HIS OBJECTIONS IN COURTEOUS
4856-20410-0022 AND EVEN GRACIOUS FORMS OF SPEECH SINGULARLY OUT OF AGREEMENT WITH THE CHARACTER THAT MISTER WEISS HAD GIVEN HIM I THANGYOU HE MUMBLED THICKLY
4856-20410-0023 HE LOOKED WISTFULLY AT THE BED BUT I WHEELED HIM ABOUT AND MARCHED HIM ONCE MORE DOWN THE ROOM HE SUBMITTED UNRESISTINGLY BUT AS WE AGAIN APPROACHED THE BED HE REOPENED THE MATTER
4856-20410-0024 SH'LIKE TO LIE DOWN NOW F'YOU'D BE S'GOOD YOU MUST WALK ABOUT A LITTLE LONGER MISTER GRAVES I SAID IT WOULD BE VERY BAD FOR YOU TO GO TO SLEEP AGAIN HE LOOKED AT ME WITH A CURIOUS
4856-20410-0025 DULL SURPRISE AND REFLECTED AWHILE AS IF IN SOME PERPLEXITY THEN HE LOOKED AT ME AGAIN AND SAID THING SIR YOU ARE MISTAKE MISTAKEN ME MIST HERE MISSUS SCHALLIBAUM INTERRUPTED SHARPLY
4856-20410-0026 THE DOCTOR THINKS IT'S GOOD FOR YOU TO WALK ABOUT YOU'VE BEEN SLEEPING TOO MUCH HE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO SLEEP ANY MORE JUST NOW
4856-20410-0027 YOU MUST WALK ABOUT FOR A FEW MINUTES MORE AND YOU'D BETTER NOT TALK JUST WALK UP AND DOWN
4856-20410-0028 APPARENTLY HE TOOK IN THE VERY BROAD HINT CONTAINED IN THE CONCLUDING SENTENCE FOR HE TRUDGED WEARILY AND UNSTEADILY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT SPEAKING
4856-20410-0029 THOUGH HE CONTINUED TO LOOK AT ME FROM TIME TO TIME AS IF SOMETHING IN MY APPEARANCE PUZZLED HIM EXCEEDINGLY AT LENGTH HIS INTOLERABLE LONGING FOR REPOSE OVERCAME HIS POLITENESS AND HE RETURNED TO THE ATTACK
4856-20410-0030 FEELING VERY TIRED AM REALLY
4856-20410-0031 MISSUS SCHALLIBAUM ASKED I FELT HIS PULSE AND DECIDED THAT HE WAS REALLY BECOMING FATIGUED
4856-20410-0032 AND TURNED HIM ROUND IN THAT DIRECTION WHEREUPON HE TOTTERED GLEEFULLY TOWARDS HIS RESTING PLACE LIKE A TIRED HORSE HEADING FOR ITS STABLE AS SOON AS HE WAS TUCKED IN I GAVE HIM A FULL CUP OF COFFEE WHICH HE DRANK WITH SOME AVIDITY AS IF THIRSTY
4856-20410-0033 THEN I SAT DOWN BY THE BEDSIDE AND WITH A VIEW TO KEEPING HIM AWAKE BEGAN ONCE MORE TO PLY HIM WITH QUESTIONS DOES YOUR HEAD ACHE MISTER GRAVES I ASKED THE DOCTOR SAYS DOES YOUR HEAD ACHE MISSUS SCHALLIBAUM SQUALLED
4856-20410-0034 SO LOUDLY THAT THE PATIENT STARTED PERCEPTIBLY
4856-20410-0035 HE ANSWERED WITH A FAINT SMILE NOT DEAF YOU KNOW YES HEAD ACHES A GOOD DEAL BUT I THING THIS GENNLEMAN MISTAKES HE SAYS YOU ARE TO KEEP AWAKE YOU MUSTN'T GO TO SLEEP AGAIN AND YOU ARE NOT TO CLOSE YOUR EYES
4856-20410-0036 KEEP'M OPEN AND HE PROCEEDED FORTHWITH TO SHUT THEM WITH AN AIR OF INFINITE PEACEFULNESS I GRASPED HIS HAND AND SHOOK IT GENTLY ON WHICH HE OPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED AT ME SLEEPILY
4856-20410-0037 I LOOKED DOUBTFULLY AT THE PATIENT I WAS LOATH TO LEAVE HIM DISTRUSTING THESE PEOPLE AS I DID BUT I HAD MY WORK TO DO ON THE MORROW WITH PERHAPS A NIGHT CALL OR TWO IN THE INTERVAL
4856-20410-0038 AND THE ENDURANCE EVEN OF A GENERAL PRACTITIONER HAS ITS LIMITS I THINK I HEARD THE CARRIAGE SOME TIME AGO MISSUS SCHALLIBAUM ADDED I ROSE HESITATINGLY AND LOOKED AT MY WATCH IT HAD TURNED HALF PAST ELEVEN
4856-20410-0039 YOU UNDERSTAND I SAID IN A LOW VOICE THAT THE DANGER IS NOT OVER IF HE IS LEFT NOW HE WILL FALL ASLEEP AND IN ALL HUMAN PROBABILITY WILL NEVER WAKE YOU CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT
4856-20410-0040 YES QUITE CLEARLY I PROMISE YOU HE SHALL NOT BE ALLOWED TO FALL ASLEEP AGAIN AS SHE SPOKE SHE LOOKED ME FULL IN THE FACE FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND I NOTED THAT HER EYES HAD A PERFECTLY NORMAL APPEARANCE
4856-20410-0041 WITHOUT ANY TRACE WHATEVER OF A SQUINT VERY WELL I SAID ON THAT UNDERSTANDING I WILL GO NOW AND I SHALL HOPE TO FIND OUR FRIEND QUITE RECOVERED AT MY NEXT VISIT
4856-20410-0042 I TURNED TO THE PATIENT WHO WAS ALREADY DOZING AND SHOOK HIS HAND HEARTILY GOOD BYE MISTER GRAVES I SAID I AM SORRY TO HAVE TO DISTURB YOUR REPOSE SO MUCH BUT YOU MUST KEEP AWAKE YOU KNOW WON'T DO TO GO TO SLEEP
4856-20410-0043 HE REPLIED DROWSILY SORRY T GIVE YOU ALL THIS TROUBLE L KEEP AWAKE
4856-20410-0044 NOW IT'S OF NO USE FOR YOU TO ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS MISSUS SCHALLIBAUM SAID PLAYFULLY WE'LL TALK TO YOU TO MORROW GOOD NIGHT DOCTOR I'LL LIGHT YOU DOWN THE STAIRS BUT I WON'T COME DOWN WITH YOU OR THE PATIENT WILL BE FALLING ASLEEP AGAIN
4856-20410-0045 WHEN I PERCEIVED THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR ALONG THE PASSAGE A GLIMMER OF LIGHT FROM THE CARRIAGE LAMPS THE COACHMAN WAS STANDING JUST OUTSIDE
4856-20410-0046 HE REMARKED IN HIS SCOTCH DIALECT THAT I
4856-20410-0047 BUT IT SEEMED RATHER UNNECESSARY TO TAKE A FRESH SET OF NOTES AND TO TELL THE TRUTH I RATHER SHIRKED THE LABOUR TIRED AS I WAS AFTER MY LATE EXERTIONS BESIDES I WANTED TO THINK OVER THE EVENTS OF THE EVENING WHILE THEY WERE FRESH IN MY MEMORY
4856-20410-0048 ACCORDINGLY I PUT AWAY THE NOTEBOOK FILLED AND LIGHTED MY PIPE AND SETTLED MYSELF TO REVIEW THE INCIDENTS ATTENDING MY SECOND VISIT TO THIS RATHER UNCANNY HOUSE CONSIDERED IN LEISURELY RETROSPECT
4856-20410-0049 THAT VISIT OFFERED QUITE A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS THAT CALLED FOR ELUCIDATION THERE WAS THE PATIENT'S CONDITION FOR INSTANCE ANY DOUBT AS TO THE CAUSE OF HIS SYMPTOMS WAS SET AT REST BY THE EFFECT OF THE ANTIDOTES
4856-20410-0050 MISTER GRAVES WAS CERTAINLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MORPHINE AND THE ONLY DOUBTFUL QUESTION WAS HOW HE HAD BECOME SO THAT HE HAD TAKEN THE POISON HIMSELF WAS INCREDIBLE NO MORPHINOMANIAC WOULD TAKE SUCH A KNOCK DOWN DOSE
4856-20410-0051 IT WAS PRACTICALLY CERTAIN THAT THE POISON HAD BEEN ADMINISTERED BY SOMEONE ELSE AND ON MISTER WEISS'S OWN SHOWING THERE WAS NO ONE BUT HIMSELF AND THE HOUSEKEEPER WHO COULD HAVE ADMINISTERED IT AND TO THIS CONCLUSION
4856-20410-0052 ALL THE OTHER VERY QUEER CIRCUMSTANCES POINTED WHAT WERE THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY WERE AS I HAVE SAID NUMEROUS THOUGH MANY OF THEM SEEMED TRIVIAL TO BEGIN WITH
4856-20410-0053 MISTER WEISS'S HABIT OF APPEARING SOME TIME AFTER MY ARRIVAL AND DISAPPEARING SOME TIME BEFORE MY DEPARTURE WAS DECIDEDLY ODD BUT STILL MORE ODD WAS HIS SUDDEN DEPARTURE THIS EVENING ON WHAT LOOKED LIKE A MERE PRETEXT
4856-20410-0054 THAT DEPARTURE COINCIDED IN TIME WITH THE SICK MAN'S RECOVERY OF THE POWER OF SPEECH COULD IT BE THAT MISTER WEISS WAS AFRAID THAT THE HALF CONSCIOUS MAN MIGHT SAY SOMETHING COMPROMISING TO HIM IN MY PRESENCE IT LOOKED RATHER LIKE IT
4856-20410-0055 AND YET HE HAD GONE AWAY AND LEFT ME WITH THE PATIENT AND THE HOUSEKEEPER BUT WHEN I CAME TO THINK ABOUT IT I REMEMBERED THAT MISSUS SCHALLIBAUM HAD SHOWN SOME ANXIETY TO PREVENT THE PATIENT FROM TALKING
4856-20410-0056 SHE HAD INTERRUPTED HIM MORE THAN ONCE AND HAD ON TWO OCCASIONS BROKEN IN WHEN HE SEEMED TO BE ABOUT TO ASK ME SOME QUESTION I WAS MISTAKEN ABOUT SOMETHING WHAT WAS THAT SOMETHING THAT HE WANTED TO TELL ME
4856-20410-0057 IT HAD STRUCK ME AS SINGULAR THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO COFFEE IN THE HOUSE BUT A SUFFICIENCY OF TEA GERMANS ARE NOT USUALLY TEA DRINKERS AND THEY DO TAKE COFFEE BUT PERHAPS THERE WAS NOTHING IN THIS
4856-20410-0058 WHY COULD HE NOT BE SENT TO FETCH THE COFFEE AND WHY DID NOT HE RATHER THAN THE HOUSEKEEPER COME TO TAKE THE PLACE OF MISTER WEISS WHEN THE LATTER HAD TO GO AWAY THERE WERE OTHER POINTS TOO I RECALLED THE WORD THAT SOUNDED LIKE POL'N
4856-20410-0059 WHICH MISTER GRAVES HAD USED IN SPEAKING TO THE HOUSEKEEPER APPARENTLY IT WAS A CHRISTIAN NAME OF SOME KIND BUT WHY DID MISTER GRAVES CALL THE WOMAN BY HER CHRISTIAN NAME WHEN MISTER WEISS ADDRESSED HER FORMALLY AS MISSUS SCHALLIBAUM
4856-20410-0060 I HAD DETECTED THE DISPLACEMENT WHEN SHE HAD TRIED TO MAINTAIN THE EFFORT TOO LONG AND THE MUSCULAR CONTROL HAD GIVEN WAY BUT WHY HAD SHE DONE IT WAS IT ONLY FEMININE VANITY
4856-20410-0061 AND HERE I MET WITH A REAL POSER I HAD CERTAINLY SEEN THROUGH THOSE SPECTACLES AS CLEARLY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN PLAIN WINDOW GLASS AND THEY HAD CERTAINLY GIVEN AN INVERTED REFLECTION OF THE CANDLE FLAME
4856-20410-0062 LIKE THAT THROWN FROM THE SURFACE OF A CONCAVE LENS NOW THEY OBVIOUSLY COULD NOT BE BOTH FLAT AND CONCAVE BUT YET THEY HAD THE PROPERTIES PECULIAR TO BOTH FLATNESS AND CONCAVITY
4856-20410-0063 AND THERE WAS A FURTHER DIFFICULTY IF I COULD SEE OBJECTS UNALTERED THROUGH THEM SO COULD MISTER WEISS BUT THE FUNCTION OF SPECTACLES IS TO ALTER THE APPEARANCES OF OBJECTS BY MAGNIFICATION REDUCTION OR COMPENSATING DISTORTION
4856-20410-0064 IF THEY LEAVE THE APPEARANCES UNCHANGED THEY ARE USELESS I COULD MAKE NOTHING OF IT AFTER PUZZLING OVER IT FOR QUITE A LONG TIME I HAD TO GIVE IT UP
4856-20410-0065 HAD NO APPARENT BEARING ON THE CASE ON ARRIVING HOME I LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT THE MESSAGE BOOK AND WAS RELIEVED TO FIND THAT THERE WERE NO FURTHER VISITS TO BE MADE HAVING MADE UP A MIXTURE FOR MISTER GRAVES AND HANDED IT TO THE COACHMAN
4856-20410-0066 I RAKED THE ASHES OF THE SURGERY FIRE TOGETHER AND SAT DOWN TO SMOKE A FINAL PIPE WHILE I REFLECTED ONCE MORE ON THE SINGULAR AND SUSPICIOUS CASE IN WHICH I HAD BECOME INVOLVED BUT FATIGUE SOON PUT AN END TO MY MEDITATIONS
