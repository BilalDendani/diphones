5230-4844-0000 WHEN OF COURSE THEY ARE LIABLE TO ACCIDENT
5230-4844-0001 AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION IT APPEARED THAT THE CHOICE LAY BETWEEN TWO FAIRIES ONE CALLED SURCANTINE
5230-4844-0002 UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED THAT WHICHEVER OF THE TWO COULD SHOW TO THE WORLD THE GREATEST WONDER SHOULD BE QUEEN BUT IT WAS TO BE A SPECIAL KIND OF WONDER
5230-4844-0003 NO MOVING OF MOUNTAINS OR ANY SUCH COMMON FAIRY TRICKS WOULD DO SURCANTINE THEREFORE RESOLVED THAT SHE WOULD BRING UP A PRINCE WHOM NOTHING COULD MAKE CONSTANT
5230-4844-0004 NOW PARIDAMIE HAD FOR A LONG TIME BEEN VERY FRIENDLY WITH KING BARDONDON WHO WAS A MOST ACCOMPLISHED PRINCE AND WHOSE COURT WAS THE MODEL OF WHAT A COURT SHOULD BE HIS QUEEN
5230-4844-0005 BALANICE WAS ALSO CHARMING INDEED IT IS RARE TO FIND A HUSBAND AND WIFE SO PERFECTLY OF ONE MIND ABOUT EVERYTHING
5230-4844-0006 BECAUSE SHE HAD A LITTLE PINK ROSE PRINTED UPON HER WHITE THROAT FROM HER EARLIEST INFANCY SHE HAD SHOWN THE MOST ASTONISHING INTELLIGENCE AND THE COURTIERS KNEW HER SMART SAYINGS BY HEART AND REPEATED THEM ON ALL OCCASIONS
5230-4844-0007 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT FOLLOWING THE ASSEMBLY OF FAIRIES QUEEN BALANICE WOKE UP WITH A SHRIEK AND WHEN HER MAIDS OF HONOUR RAN TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER THEY FOUND SHE HAD HAD A FRIGHTFUL DREAM I THOUGHT SAID SHE
5230-4844-0008 SO THEY RAN BUT WHAT WAS THEIR DISMAY WHEN THEY FOUND THAT THE CRADLE WAS EMPTY AND THOUGH THEY SOUGHT HIGH AND LOW NOT A TRACE OF ROSANELLA COULD THEY DISCOVER THE QUEEN WAS INCONSOLABLE AND SO INDEED WAS THE KING
5230-4844-0009 ONE LOVELY SUMMER EVENING AS THEY SAT TOGETHER ON A SHADY LAWN SHAPED LIKE A STAR FROM WHICH RADIATED TWELVE SPLENDID AVENUES OF TREES
5230-4844-0010 AS EACH DREW NEAR SHE LAID HER BASKET AT BALANICE'S FEET SAYING CHARMING QUEEN MAY THIS BE SOME SLIGHT CONSOLATION TO YOU IN YOUR UNHAPPINESS THE QUEEN HASTILY OPENED THE BASKETS AND FOUND IN EACH A LOVELY BABY GIRL
5230-4844-0011 ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS THE LITTLE PRINCESS FOR WHOM SHE SORROWED SO DEEPLY AT FIRST THE SIGHT OF THEM RENEWED HER GRIEF
5230-4844-0012 AND IN SENDING HITHER AND THITHER FOR SWINGS AND DOLLS AND TOPS AND BUSHELS OF THE FINEST SWEETMEATS ODDLY ENOUGH EVERY BABY HAD UPON ITS THROAT A TINY PINK ROSE THE QUEEN FOUND IT SO DIFFICULT TO DECIDE ON SUITABLE NAMES FOR ALL OF THEM
5230-4844-0013 BY WHICH IT WAS KNOWN SO THAT WHEN THEY WERE ALL TOGETHER THEY LOOKED LIKE NOTHING SO MUCH AS A NOSEGAY OF GAY FLOWERS AS THEY GREW OLDER IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT THOUGH THEY WERE ALL REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT
5230-4844-0014 AND PROFITED EQUALLY BY THE EDUCATION THEY RECEIVED YET THEY DIFFERED ONE FROM ANOTHER IN DISPOSITION SO MUCH SO THAT THEY GRADUALLY CEASED TO BE KNOWN AS
5230-4844-0015 AND THE QUEEN INSTEAD WOULD SAY WHERE IS MY SWEET OR MY BEAUTIFUL OR MY GAY OF COURSE WITH ALL THESE CHARMS THEY HAD LOVERS BY THE DOZEN
5230-4844-0016 NOT ONLY IN THEIR OWN COURT BUT PRINCES FROM AFAR WHO WERE CONSTANTLY ARRIVING ATTRACTED BY THE REPORTS WHICH WERE SPREAD ABROAD BUT THESE LOVELY GIRLS THE FIRST MAIDS OF HONOUR WERE AS DISCREET AS THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL
5230-4844-0017 AND FAVOURED NO ONE BUT LET US RETURN TO SURCANTINE SHE HAD FIXED UPON THE SON OF A KING WHO WAS COUSIN TO BARDONDON TO BRING UP AS HER FICKLE PRINCE SHE HAD BEFORE AT HIS CHRISTENING
5230-4844-0018 GIVEN HIM ALL THE GRACES OF MIND AND BODY THAT A PRINCE COULD POSSIBLY REQUIRE BUT NOW SHE REDOUBLED HER EFFORTS AND SPARED NO PAINS IN ADDING EVERY IMAGINABLE CHARM AND FASCINATION
5230-4844-0019 HE WAS ALWAYS PERFECTLY IRRESISTIBLE IN TRUTH HE WAS A CHARMING YOUNG FELLOW SINCE THE FAIRY HAD GIVEN HIM THE BEST HEART IN THE WORLD AS WELL AS THE BEST HEAD AND HAD LEFT NOTHING TO BE DESIRED BUT CONSTANCY
5230-4844-0020 FOR IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT PRINCE MIRLIFLOR WAS A DESPERATE FLIRT AND AS FICKLE AS THE WIND SO MUCH SO THAT BY THE TIME HE ARRIVED AT HIS EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY
5230-4844-0021 THEY WERE ALL HIS OWN AND HE WAS TIRED OF EVERYONE THINGS WERE IN THIS STATE WHEN HE WAS INVITED TO VISIT THE COURT OF HIS FATHER'S COUSIN KING BARDONDON
5230-4844-0022 IMAGINE HIS FEELINGS WHEN HE ARRIVED AND WAS PRESENTED AT ONCE TO TWELVE OF THE LOVELIEST CREATURES IN THE WORLD AND HIS EMBARRASSMENT WAS HEIGHTENED BY THE FACT THAT THEY ALL LIKED HIM AS MUCH AS HE LIKED EACH ONE OF THEM
5230-4844-0023 SO THAT THINGS CAME TO SUCH A PASS THAT HE WAS NEVER HAPPY A SINGLE INSTANT WITHOUT THEM FOR COULD HE NOT WHISPER SOFT SPEECHES TO SWEET AND LAUGH WITH JOY WHILE HE LOOKED AT BEAUTY
5230-4844-0024 AND IN HIS MORE SERIOUS MOMENTS WHAT COULD BE PLEASANTER THAN TO TALK TO GRAVE UPON SOME SHADY LAWN
5230-4844-0025 AND ALL THE OTHERS LINGERED NEAR IN SYMPATHETIC SILENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE REALLY LOVED THOUGH THE OBJECT OF HIS DEVOTION WAS NOT ONE PERSON BUT TWELVE
5230-4844-0026 UTTERED LITTLE SHRIEKS AND FLED ALL TOGETHER TO A DISTANCE FROM THE REST OF THE COMPANY IMMEDIATELY TO THE HORROR OF ALL WHO WERE LOOKING ON THE BEES PURSUED THEM
5230-4844-0027 AND GROWING SUDDENLY TO AN ENORMOUS SIZE POUNCED EACH UPON A MAIDEN AND CARRIED HER OFF INTO THE AIR AND IN AN INSTANT THEY WERE ALL LOST TO VIEW THIS AMAZING OCCURRENCE PLUNGED THE WHOLE COURT INTO THE DEEPEST AFFLICTION
5230-4844-0028 AND PRINCE MIRLIFLOR AFTER GIVING WAY TO THE MOST VIOLENT GRIEF AT FIRST FELL GRADUALLY INTO A STATE OF SUCH DEEP DEJECTION THAT IT WAS FEARED IF NOTHING COULD ROUSE HIM HE WOULD CERTAINLY DIE
5230-4844-0029 SURCANTINE CAME IN ALL HASTE TO SEE WHAT SHE COULD DO FOR HER DARLING BUT HE REJECTED WITH SCORN ALL THE PORTRAITS OF LOVELY PRINCESSES WHICH SHE OFFERED HIM FOR HIS COLLECTION IN SHORT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS IN A BAD WAY
5230-4844-0030 AND THE FAIRY WAS AT HER WITS END ONE DAY AS HE WANDERED ABOUT ABSORBED IN MELANCHOLY REFLECTIONS HE HEARD SUDDEN SHOUTS AND EXCLAMATIONS OF AMAZEMENT AND IF HE HAD TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO LOOK UP
5230-4844-0031 HE COULD NOT HAVE HELPED BEING AS ASTONISHED AS EVERYONE ELSE FOR THROUGH THE AIR A CHARIOT OF CRYSTAL WAS SLOWLY APPROACHING WHICH GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE SIX LOVELY MAIDENS WITH SHINING WINGS DREW IT BY ROSE COLOURED RIBBONS
5230-4844-0032 WHILE A WHOLE FLIGHT OF OTHERS EQUALLY BEAUTIFUL WERE HOLDING LONG GARLANDS OF ROSES CROSSED ABOVE IT SO AS TO FORM A COMPLETE CANOPY IN IT SAT THE FAIRY PARIDAMIE AND BY HER SIDE A
5230-4844-0033 AND PROCEEDED TO THE QUEEN'S APARTMENTS THOUGH EVERYONE HAD RUN TOGETHER TO SEE THIS MARVEL
5230-4844-0034 AND EXCLAMATIONS OF WONDER ROSE ON ALL SIDES AT THE LOVELINESS OF THE STRANGE PRINCESS GREAT QUEEN SAID PARIDAMIE PERMIT ME TO RESTORE TO YOU YOUR DAUGHTER ROSANELLA WHOM I STOLE OUT OF HER CRADLE
5230-4844-0035 BUT MY TWELVE LOVELY ONES ARE THEY LOST TO ME FOR EVER SHALL I NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN BUT PARIDAMIE ONLY SAID VERY SOON YOU WILL CEASE TO MISS THEM IN A TONE THAT EVIDENTLY MEANT
5230-4844-0036 DON'T ASK ME ANY MORE QUESTIONS AND THEN MOUNTING AGAIN INTO HER CHARIOT SHE SWIFTLY DISAPPEARED
5230-4844-0037 HOWEVER IT BECAME ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD PAY HIS RESPECTS AND HE HAD SCARCELY BEEN FIVE MINUTES IN HER PRESENCE BEFORE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SHE COMBINED IN HER OWN CHARMING PERSON ALL THE GIFTS AND GRACES
5230-4844-0038 IN THE TWELVE ROSE MAIDENS WHOSE LOSS HE HAD SO TRULY MOURNED AND AFTER ALL IT IS REALLY MORE SATISFACTORY TO MAKE LOVE TO ONE PERSON AT A TIME SO IT CAME TO PASS THAT BEFORE HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS HE WAS ENTREATING HIS LOVELY COUSIN TO MARRY HIM
5230-4844-0039 AND THE MOMENT THE WORDS HAD LEFT HIS LIPS PARIDAMIE APPEARED SMILING AND TRIUMPHANT IN THE CHARIOT OF THE QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES FOR BY THAT TIME THEY HAD ALL HEARD OF HER SUCCESS AND DECLARED HER TO HAVE EARNED THE KINGDOM
5230-4844-0040 SHE HAD TO GIVE A FULL ACCOUNT OF HOW SHE HAD STOLEN ROSANELLA FROM HER CRADLE AND DIVIDED HER CHARACTER INTO TWELVE PARTS THAT EACH MIGHT CHARM PRINCE MIRLIFLOR
5230-4844-0041 AND AS ONE MORE PROOF OF THE FASCINATION OF THE WHOLE ROSANELLA I MAY TELL YOU THAT EVEN THE DEFEATED SURCANTINE SENT HER A WEDDING GIFT AND WAS PRESENT AT THE CEREMONY WHICH TOOK PLACE AS SOON AS THE GUESTS COULD ARRIVE
5230-4844-0042 PRINCE MIRLIFLOR WAS CONSTANT FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE AND INDEED WHO WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN HIS PLACE
