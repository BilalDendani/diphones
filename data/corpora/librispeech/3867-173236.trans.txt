3867-173236-0024 BUT SUCH COLLECTIONS MAY BE BEYOND YOUR REACH AND I WILL ONLY REFER YOU TO A CASE IN YESTERDAY'S NEWSPAPER THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THE EXAMPLE OF RESOLUTION IN A WOMAN
3867-173236-0025 IS AN EXAMPLE WORTH YOUR NOTICE
3867-173236-0026 CHARGED WITH FRAUDULENTLY REPRESENTING HERSELF TO BE THE MISSING WIDOW OF AN OFFICER IN THE MERCHANT SERVICE WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN DROWNED THE NAME OF THE PRISONER'S HUSBAND LIVING AND THE NAME OF THE OFFICER
3867-173236-0027 A VERY COMMON ONE BOTH AS TO CHRISTIAN AND SURNAME HAPPENED TO BE IDENTICALLY THE SAME THERE WAS MONEY TO BE GOT BY IT SORELY WANTED BY THE PRISONER'S HUSBAND TO WHOM SHE WAS DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED
3867-173236-0028 IF THE FRAUD HAD SUCCEEDED THE WOMAN TOOK IT ALL ON HERSELF HER HUSBAND WAS HELPLESS AND ILL AND THE BAILIFFS WERE AFTER HIM THE CIRCUMSTANCES AS YOU MAY READ FOR YOURSELF WERE ALL IN HER FAVOR
3867-173236-0029 AND WERE SO WELL MANAGED BY HER THAT THE LAWYERS THEMSELVES ACKNOWLEDGED SHE MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED
3867-173236-0030 HAD NOT TURNED UP ALIVE AND WELL IN THE NICK OF TIME TO CONFRONT HER THE SCENE TOOK PLACE AT THE LAWYER'S OFFICE AND CAME OUT IN THE EVIDENCE AT THE POLICE COURT THE WOMAN WAS HANDSOME AND THE SAILOR WAS A GOOD NATURED MAN
3867-173236-0031 HE WANTED AT FIRST IF THE LAWYERS WOULD HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO LET HER OFF HE SAID TO HER AMONG OTHER THINGS YOU DIDN'T COUNT ON THE DROWNED MAN COMING BACK ALIVE AND HEARTY DID YOU MA'AM
3867-173236-0032 WHY WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IF YOU HAD KNOWN I WAS COMING BACK SAYS THE SAILOR SHE LOOKED HIM STEADILY IN THE FACE AND ANSWERED I WOULD HAVE KILLED YOU THERE DO YOU THINK SUCH A WOMAN AS THAT
3867-173236-0033 WOULD HAVE WRITTEN TO TELL ME I WAS PRESSING HER FURTHER THAN SHE HAD COURAGE TO GO A HANDSOME WOMAN TOO LIKE YOURSELF YOU WOULD DRIVE SOME MEN IN MY POSITION TO WISH THEY HAD HER NOW IN YOUR PLACE I READ NO FURTHER
3867-173236-0034 WHEN I HAD GOT ON LINE BY LINE TO THOSE WORDS IT BURST ON ME LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IN AN INSTANT I SAW IT AS PLAINLY AS I SEE IT NOW IT IS HORRIBLE IT IS UNHEARD OF
3867-173236-0035 IT OUTDARES ALL DARING BUT IF I CAN ONLY NERVE MYSELF TO FACE ONE TERRIBLE NECESSITY IT IS TO BE DONE I MAY PERSONATE THE RICHLY PROVIDED WIDOW OF ALLAN ARMADALE OF THORPE AMBROSE
3867-173236-0036 IF I CAN COUNT ON ALLAN ARMADALE'S DEATH IN A GIVEN TIME THERE IN PLAIN WORDS IS THE FRIGHTFUL TEMPTATION UNDER WHICH I NOW FEEL MYSELF SINKING IT IS FRIGHTFUL IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
3867-173236-0037 FOR IT HAS COME STRAIGHT OUT OF THAT OTHER TEMPTATION TO WHICH I YIELDED IN THE BY GONE TIME YES THERE THE LETTER HAS BEEN WAITING FOR ME IN MY BOX TO SERVE A PURPOSE NEVER THOUGHT OF BY THE VILLAIN WHO WROTE IT
3867-173236-0038 THERE IS THE CASE AS HE CALLED IT ONLY QUOTED TO TAUNT ME UTTERLY UNLIKE MY OWN CASE AT THE TIME THERE IT HAS BEEN WAITING AND LURKING FOR ME THROUGH ALL THE CHANGES IN MY LIFE
3867-173236-0039 TILL IT HAS COME TO BE LIKE MY CASE AT LAST IT MIGHT STARTLE ANY WOMAN TO SEE THIS AND EVEN THIS IS NOT THE WORST
3867-173236-0040 THE WHOLE THING HAS BEEN IN MY DIARY FOR DAYS PAST WITHOUT MY KNOWING IT EVERY IDLE FANCY THAT ESCAPED ME HAS BEEN TENDING SECRETLY THAT ONE WAY AND I NEVER SAW
3867-173236-0041 NEVER SUSPECTED IT TILL THE READING OF THE LETTER PUT MY OWN THOUGHTS BEFORE ME IN A NEW LIGHT TILL I SAW THE SHADOW OF MY OWN CIRCUMSTANCES SUDDENLY REFLECTED IN ONE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE
3867-173236-0042 OF THAT OTHER WOMAN'S CASE IT IS TO BE DONE IF I CAN BUT LOOK THE NECESSITY IN THE FACE IT IS TO BE DONE IF I CAN COUNT ON ALLAN ARMADALE'S DEATH IN A GIVEN TIME

3867-173236-0044 EVENTS PAVING THE WAY SMOOTHLY AND MORE SMOOTHLY STRAIGHT TO THE END IN THREE BOLD STEPS ONLY THREE THAT END MIGHT BE REACHED LET MIDWINTER MARRY ME PRIVATELY
3867-173236-0045 UNDER HIS REAL NAME STEP THE FIRST LET ARMADALE LEAVE THORPE AMBROSE A SINGLE MAN AND DIE IN SOME DISTANT PLACE AMONG STRANGERS STEP THE SECOND
