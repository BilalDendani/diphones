7395-89882-0030 WAS SO BARBAROUS IN HIS DISPOSITION AND MANNER OF LIVING THAT HE DID NOT EVEN SPARE WOMEN AND INNOCENT CHILDREN BUT WITH BESTIAL CRUELTY PUT ALL ALIKE TO DEATH BY TORTURE AND OVERRAN ALL THEIR COUNTRY IN HIS FURY FOR A LONG TIME
7395-89882-0031 INTENDING TO CUT OFF ALL THE RACE OF THE ENGLISH WITHIN THE BORDERS OF BRITAIN NOR DID HE PAY ANY RESPECT TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION WHICH HAD SPRUNG UP AMONG THEM IT BEING TO THIS DAY THE CUSTOM OF THE BRITONS TO DESPISE THE FAITH AND RELIGION OF THE ENGLISH
7395-89882-0032 AND TO HAVE NO PART WITH THEM IN ANYTHING ANY MORE THAN WITH PAGANS
