1776-139035-0000 THE READER MAY REMEMBER THAT WE WERE LED TO PLUNGE INTO THE LABYRINTH OF MAGIC BY A CONSIDERATION OF TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF MAN GOD THIS IS THE CLUE WHICH HAS GUIDED OUR DEVIOUS STEPS THROUGH THE MAZE AND BROUGHT US OUT AT LAST ON HIGHER GROUND WHENCE
1776-139035-0001 RESTING A LITTLE BY THE WAY WE CAN LOOK BACK OVER THE PATH WE HAVE ALREADY TRAVERSED
1776-139035-0002 AS A RESULT OF THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION THE TWO TYPES OF HUMAN GODS MAY CONVENIENTLY BE DISTINGUISHED AS THE RELIGIOUS AND THE MAGICAL MAN GOD RESPECTIVELY IN THE FORMER A BEING OF AN ORDER DIFFERENT FROM AND SUPERIOR TO MAN IS SUPPOSED TO BECOME INCARNATE
1776-139035-0003 MANIFESTING HIS SUPER HUMAN POWER AND KNOWLEDGE BY MIRACLES WROUGHT AND PROPHECIES UTTERED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE FLESHLY TABERNACLE IN WHICH HE HAS DEIGNED TO TAKE UP HIS ABODE THIS MAY ALSO APPROPRIATELY BE CALLED THE INSPIRED OR INCARNATE TYPE OF MAN GOD
1776-139035-0004 IN IT THE HUMAN BODY IS MERELY A FRAIL EARTHLY VESSEL FILLED WITH A DIVINE AND IMMORTAL SPIRIT ON THE OTHER HAND A MAN GOD OF THE MAGICAL SORT IS NOTHING BUT A MAN WHO POSSESSES IN AN UNUSUALLY HIGH DEGREE POWERS WHICH
1776-139035-0005 MOST OF HIS FELLOWS ARROGATE TO THEMSELVES ON A SMALLER SCALE FOR IN RUDE SOCIETY THERE IS HARDLY A PERSON WHO DOES NOT DABBLE IN MAGIC THUS WHEREAS A MAN GOD OF THE FORMER OR INSPIRED TYPE DERIVES HIS DIVINITY FROM A DEITY WHO HAS STOOPED TO HIDE
1776-139035-0006 HIS HEAVENLY RADIANCE BEHIND A DULL MASK OF EARTHLY MOULD A MAN GOD OF THE LATTER TYPE DRAWS HIS EXTRAORDINARY POWER FROM A CERTAIN PHYSICAL SYMPATHY WITH NATURE HE IS NOT MERELY THE RECEPTACLE OF A DIVINE SPIRIT HIS WHOLE BEING BODY AND SOUL
1776-139035-0007 IS SO DELICATELY ATTUNED TO THE HARMONY OF THE WORLD THAT A TOUCH OF HIS HAND OR A TURN OF HIS HEAD MAY SEND A THRILL VIBRATING THROUGH THE UNIVERSAL FRAMEWORK OF THINGS AND CONVERSELY HIS DIVINE ORGANISM IS ACUTELY SENSITIVE TO SUCH SLIGHT CHANGES OF ENVIRONMENT
1776-139035-0008 AS WOULD LEAVE ORDINARY MORTALS WHOLLY UNAFFECTED BUT THE LINE BETWEEN THESE TWO TYPES OF MAN GOD HOWEVER SHARPLY WE MAY DRAW IT IN THEORY IS SELDOM TO BE TRACED WITH PRECISION IN PRACTICE AND IN WHAT FOLLOWS I SHALL NOT INSIST ON IT
1776-139035-0009 WE HAVE SEEN THAT IN PRACTICE THE MAGIC ART MAY BE EMPLOYED FOR THE BENEFIT EITHER OF INDIVIDUALS OR OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY AND THAT ACCORDING AS IT IS DIRECTED TO ONE OR OTHER OF THESE TWO OBJECTS IT MAY BE CALLED PRIVATE OR PUBLIC MAGIC
1776-139035-0010 FURTHER I POINTED OUT THAT THE PUBLIC MAGICIAN OCCUPIES A POSITION OF GREAT INFLUENCE FROM WHICH IF HE IS A PRUDENT AND ABLE MAN HE MAY ADVANCE STEP BY STEP TO THE RANK OF A CHIEF OR KING
1776-139035-0011 THUS AN EXAMINATION OF PUBLIC MAGIC CONDUCES TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE EARLY KINGSHIP SINCE IN SAVAGE AND BARBAROUS SOCIETY MANY CHIEFS AND KINGS APPEAR TO OWE THEIR AUTHORITY IN GREAT MEASURE TO THEIR REPUTATION AS MAGICIANS
1776-139035-0012 AMONG THE OBJECTS OF PUBLIC UTILITY WHICH MAGIC MAY BE EMPLOYED TO SECURE THE MOST ESSENTIAL IS AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF FOOD THE EXAMPLES CITED IN PRECEDING PAGES PROVE THAT THE PURVEYORS OF FOOD THE HUNTER THE FISHER THE FARMER
1776-139035-0013 ALL RESORT TO MAGICAL PRACTICES IN THE PURSUIT OF THEIR VARIOUS CALLINGS BUT THEY DO SO AS PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES RATHER THAN AS PUBLIC FUNCTIONARIES ACTING IN THE INTEREST OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE
1776-139035-0014 IT IS OTHERWISE WHEN THE RITES ARE PERFORMED NOT BY THE HUNTERS THE FISHERS THE FARMERS THEMSELVES BUT BY PROFESSIONAL MAGICIANS ON THEIR BEHALF IN PRIMITIVE SOCIETY WHERE UNIFORMITY OF OCCUPATION IS THE RULE
1776-139035-0015 AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMMUNITY INTO VARIOUS CLASSES OF WORKERS HAS HARDLY BEGUN EVERY MAN IS MORE OR LESS HIS OWN MAGICIAN HE PRACTISES CHARMS AND INCANTATIONS FOR HIS OWN GOOD AND THE INJURY OF HIS ENEMIES
1776-139035-0016 BUT A GREAT STEP IN ADVANCE HAS BEEN TAKEN WHEN A SPECIAL CLASS OF MAGICIANS HAS BEEN INSTITUTED WHEN IN OTHER WORDS A NUMBER OF MEN HAVE BEEN SET APART FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF BENEFITING THE WHOLE COMMUNITY BY THEIR SKILL
1776-139035-0017 WHETHER THAT SKILL BE DIRECTED TO THE HEALING OF DISEASES THE FORECASTING OF THE FUTURE THE REGULATION OF THE WEATHER OR ANY OTHER OBJECT OF GENERAL UTILITY THE IMPOTENCE OF THE MEANS ADOPTED BY MOST OF THESE PRACTITIONERS TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR ENDS
1776-139035-0018 OUGHT NOT TO BLIND US TO THE IMMENSE IMPORTANCE OF THE INSTITUTION ITSELF HERE IS A BODY OF MEN RELIEVED AT LEAST IN THE HIGHER STAGES OF SAVAGERY FROM THE NEED OF EARNING THEIR LIVELIHOOD BY HARD MANUAL TOIL AND ALLOWED NAY EXPECTED AND ENCOURAGED
1776-139035-0019 TO PROSECUTE RESEARCHES INTO THE SECRET WAYS OF NATURE IT WAS AT ONCE THEIR DUTY AND THEIR INTEREST TO KNOW MORE THAN THEIR FELLOWS TO ACQUAINT THEMSELVES WITH EVERYTHING THAT COULD AID MAN IN HIS ARDUOUS STRUGGLE WITH NATURE EVERYTHING THAT COULD MITIGATE HIS SUFFERINGS AND PROLONG HIS LIFE
1776-139035-0020 THE PROPERTIES OF DRUGS AND MINERALS THE CAUSES OF RAIN AND DROUGHT OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING THE CHANGES OF THE SEASONS THE PHASES OF THE MOON THE DAILY AND YEARLY JOURNEYS OF THE SUN THE MOTIONS OF THE STARS
1776-139035-0021 AND THE MYSTERY OF DEATH ALL THESE THINGS MUST HAVE EXCITED THE WONDER OF THESE EARLY PHILOSOPHERS
1776-139035-0022 IN THE MOST PRACTICAL FORM BY THE IMPORTUNATE DEMANDS OF THEIR CLIENTS WHO EXPECTED THEM NOT MERELY TO UNDERSTAND BUT TO REGULATE THE GREAT PROCESSES OF NATURE FOR THE GOOD OF MAN
1776-139035-0023 THAT THEIR FIRST SHOTS FELL VERY FAR WIDE OF THE MARK COULD HARDLY BE HELPED THE SLOW THE NEVER ENDING APPROACH TO TRUTH CONSISTS IN PERPETUALLY FORMING AND TESTING HYPOTHESES
1776-139035-0024 ACCEPTING THOSE WHICH AT THE TIME SEEM TO FIT THE FACTS AND REJECTING THE OTHERS THE VIEWS OF NATURAL CAUSATION EMBRACED BY THE SAVAGE MAGICIAN NO DOUBT APPEAR TO US MANIFESTLY FALSE AND ABSURD YET IN THEIR DAY THEY WERE LEGITIMATE HYPOTHESES
1776-139035-0025 THOUGH THEY HAVE NOT STOOD THE TEST OF EXPERIENCE RIDICULE AND BLAME ARE THE JUST MEED NOT OF THOSE WHO DEVISED THESE CRUDE THEORIES BUT OF THOSE WHO OBSTINATELY ADHERED TO THEM AFTER BETTER HAD BEEN PROPOUNDED
1776-139035-0026 TO MAINTAIN AT LEAST A SHOW OF KNOWLEDGE WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY A SINGLE MISTAKE DETECTED MIGHT COST THEM THEIR LIFE THIS NO DOUBT LED THEM TO PRACTISE IMPOSTURE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONCEALING THEIR IGNORANCE BUT IT ALSO SUPPLIED THEM WITH THE MOST POWERFUL MOTIVE
1776-139035-0027 FOR SUBSTITUTING A REAL FOR A SHAM KNOWLEDGE SINCE IF YOU WOULD APPEAR TO KNOW ANYTHING BY FAR THE BEST WAY IS ACTUALLY TO KNOW IT THUS HOWEVER JUSTLY WE MAY REJECT THE EXTRAVAGANT PRETENSIONS OF MAGICIANS
1776-139035-0028 AND CONDEMN THE DECEPTIONS WHICH THEY HAVE PRACTISED ON MANKIND THE ORIGINAL INSTITUTION OF THIS CLASS OF MEN HAS TAKE IT ALL IN ALL BEEN PRODUCTIVE OF INCALCULABLE GOOD TO HUMANITY
1776-139035-0029 THEY WERE THE DIRECT PREDECESSORS NOT MERELY OF OUR PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS BUT OF OUR INVESTIGATORS AND DISCOVERERS IN EVERY BRANCH OF NATURAL SCIENCE THEY BEGAN THE WORK WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN CARRIED TO SUCH GLORIOUS AND BENEFICENT ISSUES
1776-139035-0030 BY THEIR SUCCESSORS IN AFTER AGES AND IF THE BEGINNING WAS POOR AND FEEBLE THIS IS TO BE IMPUTED TO THE INEVITABLE DIFFICULTIES WHICH BESET THE PATH OF KNOWLEDGE RATHER THAN TO THE NATURAL INCAPACITY OR WILFUL FRAUD OF THE MEN THEMSELVES
1776-139035-0031 THE MAGICAL CONTROL OF RAIN OF THE THINGS WHICH THE PUBLIC MAGICIAN SETS HIMSELF TO DO FOR THE GOOD OF THE TRIBE ONE OF THE CHIEF IS TO CONTROL THE WEATHER AND ESPECIALLY TO ENSURE AN ADEQUATE FALL OF RAIN WATER IS AN ESSENTIAL OF LIFE
1776-139035-0032 AND IN MOST COUNTRIES THE SUPPLY OF IT DEPENDS UPON SHOWERS WITHOUT RAIN VEGETATION WITHERS ANIMALS AND MEN LANGUISH AND DIE HENCE IN SAVAGE COMMUNITIES THE RAIN MAKER IS A VERY IMPORTANT PERSONAGE AND OFTEN A SPECIAL CLASS OF MAGICIANS EXISTS
1776-139035-0033 FOR THE PURPOSE OF REGULATING THE HEAVENLY WATER SUPPLY THE METHODS BY WHICH THEY ATTEMPT TO DISCHARGE THE DUTIES OF THEIR OFFICE ARE COMMONLY THOUGH NOT ALWAYS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF HOMOEOPATHIC OR IMITATIVE MAGIC
1776-139035-0034 IF THEY WISH TO MAKE RAIN THEY SIMULATE IT BY SPRINKLING WATER OR MIMICKING CLOUDS IF THEIR OBJECT IS TO STOP RAIN AND CAUSE DROUGHT THEY AVOID WATER AND RESORT TO WARMTH AND FIRE FOR THE SAKE OF DRYING UP THE TOO ABUNDANT MOISTURE
1776-139035-0035 SUCH ATTEMPTS ARE BY NO MEANS CONFINED AS THE CULTIVATED READER MIGHT IMAGINE TO THE NAKED INHABITANTS OF THOSE SULTRY LANDS LIKE CENTRAL AUSTRALIA AND SOME PARTS OF EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICA
1776-139035-0036 WHERE OFTEN FOR MONTHS TOGETHER THE PITILESS SUN BEATS DOWN OUT OF A BLUE AND CLOUDLESS SKY ON THE PARCHED AND GAPING EARTH THEY ARE OR USED TO BE COMMON ENOUGH AMONG OUTWARDLY CIVILISED FOLK IN THE MOISTER CLIMATE OF EUROPE
1776-139035-0037 I WILL NOW ILLUSTRATE THEM BY INSTANCES DRAWN FROM THE PRACTICE BOTH OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MAGIC THUS FOR EXAMPLE IN A VILLAGE NEAR DORPAT IN RUSSIA WHEN RAIN WAS MUCH WANTED
1776-139035-0038 THREE MEN USED TO CLIMB UP THE FIR TREES OF AN OLD SACRED GROVE ONE OF THEM DRUMMED WITH A HAMMER ON A KETTLE OR SMALL CASK TO IMITATE THUNDER THE SECOND KNOCKED TWO FIRE BRANDS TOGETHER AND MADE THE SPARKS FLY TO IMITATE LIGHTNING AND THE THIRD
1776-139035-0039 WHO WAS CALLED THE RAIN MAKER HAD A BUNCH OF TWIGS WITH WHICH HE SPRINKLED WATER FROM A VESSEL ON ALL SIDES TO PUT AN END TO DROUGHT AND BRING DOWN RAIN WOMEN AND GIRLS OF THE VILLAGE OF PLOSKA
1776-139035-0040 ARE WONT TO GO NAKED BY NIGHT TO THE BOUNDARIES OF THE VILLAGE AND THERE POUR WATER ON THE GROUND IN HALMAHERA OR GILOLO A LARGE ISLAND TO THE WEST OF NEW GUINEA A WIZARD MAKES RAIN BY DIPPING A BRANCH OF A PARTICULAR KIND OF TREE IN WATER
1776-139035-0041 AND THEN SCATTERING THE MOISTURE FROM THE DRIPPING BOUGH OVER THE GROUND IN NEW BRITAIN THE RAIN MAKER WRAPS SOME LEAVES OF A RED AND GREEN STRIPED CREEPER IN A BANANA LEAF MOISTENS THE BUNDLE WITH WATER AND BURIES IT IN THE GROUND THEN HE IMITATES WITH HIS MOUTH
1776-139035-0042 THE PLASHING OF RAIN AMONGST THE OMAHA INDIANS OF NORTH AMERICA WHEN THE CORN IS WITHERING FOR WANT OF RAIN THE MEMBERS OF THE SACRED BUFFALO SOCIETY FILL A LARGE VESSEL WITH WATER AND DANCE FOUR TIMES ROUND IT
1776-139035-0043 ONE OF THEM DRINKS SOME OF THE WATER AND SPIRTS IT INTO THE AIR MAKING A FINE SPRAY IN IMITATION OF A MIST OR DRIZZLING RAIN THEN HE UPSETS THE VESSEL SPILLING THE WATER ON THE GROUND WHEREUPON THE DANCERS FALL DOWN AND DRINK UP THE WATER GETTING MUD ALL OVER THEIR FACES
1776-139035-0044 LASTLY THEY SQUIRT THE WATER INTO THE AIR MAKING A FINE MIST THIS SAVES THE CORN IN SPRING TIME THE NATCHEZ OF NORTH AMERICA USED TO CLUB TOGETHER TO PURCHASE FAVOURABLE WEATHER FOR THEIR CROPS FROM THE WIZARDS IF RAIN WAS NEEDED
1776-139035-0045 THE WIZARDS FASTED AND DANCED WITH PIPES FULL OF WATER IN THEIR MOUTHS THE PIPES WERE PERFORATED LIKE THE NOZZLE OF A WATERING CAN AND THROUGH THE HOLES THE RAIN MAKER BLEW THE WATER TOWARDS THAT PART OF THE SKY WHERE THE CLOUDS HUNG HEAVIEST BUT IF FINE WEATHER WAS WANTED
1776-139035-0046 HE MOUNTED THE ROOF OF HIS HUT AND WITH EXTENDED ARMS BLOWING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT HE BECKONED TO THE CLOUDS TO PASS BY WHEN THE RAINS DO NOT COME IN DUE SEASON THE PEOPLE OF CENTRAL ANGONILAND REPAIR TO WHAT IS CALLED THE RAIN TEMPLE
1776-139035-0047 HERE THEY CLEAR AWAY THE GRASS AND THE LEADER POURS BEER INTO A POT WHICH IS BURIED IN THE GROUND WHILE HE SAYS MASTER CHAUTA YOU HAVE HARDENED YOUR HEART TOWARDS US WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE US DO WE MUST PERISH INDEED
1776-139035-0048 THEN THEY ALL PARTAKE OF THE BEER THAT IS LEFT OVER EVEN THE CHILDREN BEING MADE TO SIP IT NEXT THEY TAKE BRANCHES OF TREES AND DANCE AND SING FOR RAIN
