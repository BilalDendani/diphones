4331-88349-0000 CHAPTER ONE THE POINT OF VIEW WHILE THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF LITERARY REFERENCE IN ALL THE FOLLOWING ARGUMENT I REALIZE LOOKING BACK OVER MANY ATTEMPTS TO PARAPHRASE IT FOR VARIOUS AUDIENCES
4331-88349-0001 THAT ITS APPEAL IS TO THOSE WHO SPEND THE BEST PART OF THEIR STUDENT LIFE IN CLASSIFYING AND JUDGING AND PRODUCING WORKS OF SCULPTURE PAINTING AND ARCHITECTURE
4331-88349-0002 I FIND THE EYES OF ALL OTHERS WANDERING WHEN I MAKE TALKS UPON THE PLASTIC ARTIST'S POINT OF VIEW THIS BOOK TRIES TO FIND THAT FOURTH DIMENSION OF ARCHITECTURE PAINTING AND SCULPTURE WHICH IS THE HUMAN SOUL IN ACTION THAT ARROW WITH WINGS
4331-88349-0003 WHICH IS THE FLASH OF FIRE FROM THE FILM OR THE HEART OF MAN OR PYGMALION'S IMAGE WHEN IT BECOMES A WOMAN THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN EDITION WAS USED BY VICTOR O FREEBURG AS ONE OF THE TEXT BOOKS IN THE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM
4331-88349-0004 IN HIS CLASSES IN PHOTOPLAY WRITING I WAS INVITED SEVERAL TIMES TO ADDRESS THOSE CLASSES ON MY YEARLY VISITS TO NEW YORK I HAVE ADDRESSED MANY OTHER ACADEMIC CLASSES THE INVITATION BEING BASED ON THIS BOOK NOW I REALIZE
4331-88349-0005 THAT THOSE WHO APPROACH THE THEORY FROM THE GENERAL UNIVERSITY STANDPOINT OR FROM THE HISTORY OF THE DRAMA HAD BEST BEGIN WITH FREEBURG'S BOOK FOR HE IS NOT ONLY LEARNED IN BOTH MATTERS BUT PRESENTS THE SPECIAL ANALOGIES WITH SKILL
4331-88349-0006 FREEBURG HAS AN EXCELLENT EDUCATION IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC AND SOME OF THE HAPPIEST PASSAGES IN HIS WORK RELATE THE PHOTOPLAY TO THE MUSICAL THEORY OF THE WORLD AS MY BOOK RELATES IT TO THE GENERAL ART MUSEUM POINT OF VIEW OF THE WORLD
4331-88349-0007 EMPHATICALLY MY BOOK BELONGS IN THE ART INSTITUTES AS A BEGINNING OR IN SUCH RELIGIOUS AND CIVIC BODIES AS THINK ARCHITECTURALLY FROM THERE IT MUST WORK ITS WAY OUT
4331-88349-0008 OF COURSE THOSE BODIES TOUCH ON A THOUSAND OTHERS THE WORK IS BEING USED AS ONE BASIS OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE NEW DENVER ART MUSEUM AND I LIKE TO TELL THE STORY OF HOW GEORGE W EGGERS OF DENVER
4331-88349-0009 FIRST BEGAN TO APPLY THE BOOK WHEN THE DIRECTOR OF THE ART INSTITUTE CHICAGO THAT IT MAY NOT SEEM TO THE MERELY UNIVERSITY TYPE OF MIND A WORK OF LOST ABSTRACTIONS ONE OF THE MOST GRATIFYING RECOGNITIONS I EVER RECEIVED
4331-88349-0010 WAS THE INVITATION TO TALK ON THE FILMS IN FULLERTON HALL CHICAGO ART INSTITUTE THEN THERE CAME INVITATIONS TO SPEAK AT CHICAGO UNIVERSITY AND BEFORE THE FORTNIGHTLY CLUB CHICAGO ALL AROUND NINETEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN
4331-88349-0011 ONE DIFFICULTY WAS GETTING THE FILM TO PROVE MY CASE FROM OUT THE COMMERCIAL WHIRL I TALKED AT THESE THREE AND OTHER PLACES BUT HARDLY KNEW HOW TO GO ABOUT CROSSING THE COMMERCIAL BRIDGE
4331-88349-0012 AT LAST WITH THE COOPERATION OF DIRECTOR EGGERS WE STAGED IN THE SACRED PRECINCTS OF FULLERTON HALL MAE MARSH IN THE WILD GIRL OF THE SIERRAS THE FILM WAS IN BATTERED CONDITION AND WAS TURNED SO FAST I COULD NOT TALK WITH IT SATISFACTORILY
4331-88349-0013 AND FULFIL THE WELL KNOWN PRINCIPLES OF CHAPTER FOURTEEN BUT AT LEAST I HAD CONVERTED ONE ART INSTITUTE DIRECTOR TO THE IDEA THAT AN EX STUDENT OF THE INSTITUTE COULD NOT ONLY WRITE A BOOK ABOUT PAINTING IN MOTION
4331-88349-0014 BUT THE PAINTING COULD BE SHOWN IN AN ART MUSEUM AS PROMISE OF GREATER THINGS IN THIS WORLD IT TOOK A DEAL OF WILL AND BREAKING OF PRECEDENT ON THE PART OF ALL CONCERNED TO SHOW THIS FILM THE WILD GIRL OF THE SIERRAS
4331-88349-0015 AND I RETIRED FROM THE FIELD A LONG TIME BUT NOW THIS SAME EGGERS IS STARTING IN DENVER AN ART MUSEUM FROM ITS VERY FOUNDATIONS BUT ON THE SAME CONSTRUCTIVE SCALE SO THIS ENTERPRISE IN MY FOND AND FATUOUS FANCY
4331-88349-0016 IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SWEET MAE MARSH AS THE WILD GIRL OF THE SIERRAS ONE OF THE LOVELIEST BITS OF POETRY EVER PUT INTO SCREEN OR FABLE FOR ABOUT ONE YEAR OFF AND ON I HAD THE HONOR TO BE THE PHOTOPLAY CRITIC OF THE NEW REPUBLIC
4331-88349-0017 THIS INVITATION ALSO BASED ON THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS BOOK LOOKING BACK UPON THAT EXPERIENCE I AM DELIGHTED TO AFFIRM THAT NOT ONLY THE NEW REPUBLIC CONSTITUENCY BUT THE WORLD OF THE COLLEGE AND THE UNIVERSITY WHERE I MOVED AT THAT TIME
4331-88349-0018 WERE NOT ONLY WILLING BUT EAGER TO TAKE THE FILMS WITH SERIOUSNESS BUT WHEN I WAS THROUGH WITH ALL THESE DASHES INTO THE FIELD AND WENT BACK TO RECITING VERSES AGAIN NO ONE HAD GIVEN ME ANY LIGHT AS TO WHO SHOULD MAKE THE DISINTERESTED NON COMMERCIAL FILM
4331-88349-0019 FOR THESE IMMEDIATE TIMES THE FILM THAT WOULD CLASS IN OUR CIVILIZATION WITH THE NEW REPUBLIC OR THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY OR THE POEMS OF EDWIN ARLINGTON ROBINSON THAT IS THE PRODUCTION NOT FOR THE TRADE BUT FOR THE SOUL
4331-88349-0020 ANITA LOOS THAT GOOD CRUSADER CAME OUT SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH THE FLAMING ANNOUNCEMENT
4331-88349-0021 THE SCHOOL WAS TO BE LARGELY DEVOTED TO PRODUCING MUSIC FOR THE PHOTOPLAY IN DEFIANCE OF CHAPTER FOURTEEN BUT INCIDENTALLY THERE WERE TO BE MOTION PICTURES MADE TO FIT GOOD MUSIC NEITHER MUSIC NOR FILMS HAVE AS YET SHAKEN THE WORLD
4331-88349-0022 I LIKED THIS ROCHESTER IDEA I FELT THAT ONCE IT WAS STARTED THE FILMS WOULD TAKE THEIR PROPER PLACE AND DOMINATE THE PROJECT DISINTERESTED NON COMMERCIAL FILMS TO BE CLASSED
4331-88349-0023 WITH THE DRAMAS SO WELL STIMULATED BY THE GREAT DRAMA DEPARTMENT UNDER PROFESSOR BAKER OF HARVARD AS I LOOK BACK OVER THIS HISTORY I SEE THAT THE PRINTED PAGE HAD COUNTED TOO MUCH AND THE REAL FORCES OF THE VISIBLE ARTS IN AMERICA
4331-88349-0024 HAD NOT BEEN DEFINITELY ENLISTED THEY SHOULD TAKE THE LEAD I WOULD SUGGEST AS THE THREE PEOPLE TO INTERVIEW FIRST ON BUILDING ANY ART MUSEUM PHOTOPLAY PROJECT VICTOR FREEBURG WITH HIS LONG EXPERIENCE OF TEACHING THE SUBJECT IN COLUMBIA
4331-88349-0025 AND JOHN EMERSON AND ANITA LOOS WHO ARE AS BRAINY AS PEOPLE DARE TO BE AND STILL REMAIN IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE FILM BUSINESS NO THREE PEOPLE WOULD MORE WELCOME OPPORTUNITIES TO OUTLINE THE IDEALISTIC POSSIBILITIES OF THIS FUTURE ART
4331-88349-0026 AND A WELL KNOWN AMERICAN PAINTER WAS TALKING TO ME OF A MIDNIGHT SCOLDING CHARLIE CHAPLIN GAVE TO SOME LOS ANGELES PRODUCER IN A LITTLE RESTAURANT PREACHING THE REALLY BEAUTIFUL FILM AND DENOUNCING COMMERCE LIKE A MEMBER OF COXEY'S ILLUSTRIOUS ARMY
4331-88349-0027 AND I HAVE HEARD RUMORS FROM ALL SIDES THAT CHARLIE CHAPLIN HAS A SOUL HE IS THE COMEDIAN MOST OFTEN PROCLAIMED AN ARTIST BY THE FASTIDIOUS AND MOST OFTEN FORGIVEN FOR HIS SLAPSTICK HE IS PRAISED FOR A KIND OF O HENRY DOUBLE MEANING TO HIS ANTICS
4331-88349-0028 HE IS SAID TO BE LIKE ONE OF O HENRY'S MISQUOTATIONS OF THE CLASSICS HE LOOKS TO ME LIKE THAT ARTIST EDGAR POE IF POE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO MAKE MILLIONS LAUGH I DO NOT LIKE CHAPLIN'S WORK
4331-88349-0029 BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT THE GOOD INTENTIONS AND THE ENVIABLE LAURELS LET ALL THE ART MUSEUMS INVITE HIM IN
4331-88349-0030 IF NOT A CHASTENED PERFORMER
