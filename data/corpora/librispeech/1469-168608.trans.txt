1469-168608-0003 THEY HAD COME IN A SOLID COLUMN WITH ONE OF THEIR BATTERIES ON THEIR FLANK ANOTHER IN THEIR CENTRE AND DEPLOYED IN TWO RANKS BETWEEN THE ROADS TO GENAPPE AND FRISCHEMONT
1469-168608-0004 AND TAKEN UP THEIR POSITION FOR BATTLE IN THAT POWERFUL SECOND LINE SO CLEVERLY ARRANGED BY NAPOLEON WHICH
1469-168608-0005 AIDE DE CAMP BERNARD CARRIED THEM THE EMPEROR'S ORDERS
1469-168608-0006 THEN A FORMIDABLE SPECTACLE WAS SEEN ALL THEIR CAVALRY WITH UPRAISED SWORDS STANDARDS AND TRUMPETS FLUNG TO THE BREEZE
1469-168608-0007 FORMED IN COLUMNS BY DIVISIONS DESCENDED BY A SIMULTANEOUS MOVEMENT AND LIKE ONE MAN WITH THE PRECISION OF A BRAZEN BATTERING RAM WHICH IS EFFECTING A BREACH
1469-168608-0008 DISAPPEARED THERE IN THE SMOKE THEN EMERGING FROM THAT SHADOW REAPPEARED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY STILL COMPACT AND IN CLOSE RANKS MOUNTING AT A FULL TROT THROUGH A STORM OF GRAPE SHOT WHICH BURST UPON THEM
1469-168608-0009 THE TERRIBLE MUDDY SLOPE OF THE TABLE LAND OF MONT SAINT JEAN THEY ASCENDED GRAVE THREATENING IMPERTURBABLE IN THE INTERVALS BETWEEN THE MUSKETRY AND THE ARTILLERY THEIR COLOSSAL TRAMPLING WAS AUDIBLE
1469-168608-0010 BEING TWO DIVISIONS THERE WERE TWO COLUMNS OF THEM WATHIER'S DIVISION HELD THE RIGHT DELORT'S DIVISION WAS ON THE LEFT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH TWO IMMENSE ADDERS OF STEEL
1469-168608-0011 WERE TO BE SEEN CRAWLING TOWARDS THE CREST OF THE TABLE LAND IT TRAVERSED THE BATTLE LIKE A PRODIGY
1469-168608-0012 BUT NEY WAS AGAIN PRESENT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THAT MASS HAD BECOME A MONSTER AND HAD BUT ONE SOUL
1469-168608-0013 THEY COULD BE SEEN THROUGH A VAST CLOUD OF SMOKE WHICH WAS RENT HERE AND THERE A CONFUSION OF HELMETS OF CRIES OF SABRES A STORMY HEAVING OF THE CRUPPERS OF HORSES AMID THE CANNONS AND THE FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS
1469-168608-0014 A TERRIBLE AND DISCIPLINED TUMULT OVER ALL
1469-168608-0015 LIKE THE SCALES ON THE HYDRA THESE NARRATIONS SEEMED TO BELONG TO ANOTHER AGE
1469-168608-0016 THOSE TITANS WITH HUMAN HEADS AND EQUESTRIAN CHESTS WHO SCALED OLYMPUS AT A GALLOP HORRIBLE INVULNERABLE SUBLIME GODS AND BEASTS ODD NUMERICAL COINCIDENCE
1469-168608-0017 THEY HEARD THE SWELLING NOISE OF THREE THOUSAND HORSE THE ALTERNATE AND SYMMETRICAL TRAMP OF THEIR HOOFS AT FULL TROT
1469-168608-0018 THE CLANG OF THE SABRES AND A SORT OF GRAND AND SAVAGE BREATHING THERE ENSUED A MOST TERRIBLE SILENCE
1469-168608-0019 AND CASQUES TRUMPETS AND STANDARDS AND THREE THOUSAND HEADS WITH GRAY MUSTACHES SHOUTING VIVE L'EMPEREUR
1469-168608-0020 ALL AT ONCE A TRAGIC INCIDENT ON THE ENGLISH LEFT ON OUR RIGHT
1469-168608-0021 ON ARRIVING AT THE CULMINATING POINT OF THE CREST UNGOVERNABLE UTTERLY GIVEN OVER TO FURY AND THEIR COURSE OF EXTERMINATION OF THE SQUARES AND CANNON
1469-168608-0022 A TRENCH BETWEEN THEM AND THE ENGLISH IT WAS THE HOLLOW ROAD OF OHAIN IT WAS A TERRIBLE MOMENT THE RAVINE WAS THERE UNEXPECTED YAWNING
1469-168608-0023 DIRECTLY UNDER THE HORSES FEET TWO FATHOMS DEEP BETWEEN ITS DOUBLE SLOPES THE SECOND FILE PUSHED THE FIRST INTO IT
1469-168608-0024 LANDED ON THEIR HAUNCHES SLID DOWN ALL FOUR FEET IN THE AIR CRUSHING AND OVERWHELMING THE RIDERS AND THERE BEING NO MEANS OF RETREAT THE WHOLE COLUMN BEING NO LONGER ANYTHING MORE THAN A PROJECTILE THE FORCE WHICH HAD BEEN ACQUIRED TO CRUSH THE ENGLISH
1469-168608-0025 CRUSHED THE FRENCH THE INEXORABLE RAVINE COULD ONLY YIELD WHEN FILLED HORSES AND RIDERS ROLLED THERE PELL MELL GRINDING EACH OTHER FORMING BUT ONE MASS OF FLESH IN THIS GULF
1469-168608-0026 THIS BEGAN THE LOSS OF THE BATTLE A LOCAL TRADITION WHICH EVIDENTLY EXAGGERATES MATTERS SAYS
1469-168608-0027 THIS FIGURE PROBABLY COMPRISES ALL THE OTHER CORPSES WHICH WERE FLUNG INTO THIS RAVINE
1469-168608-0028 LET US NOTE IN PASSING THAT IT WAS DUBOIS'S SORELY TRIED BRIGADE WHICH AN HOUR PREVIOUSLY MAKING A CHARGE TO ONE SIDE HAD CAPTURED THE FLAG OF THE LUNENBURG BATTALION NAPOLEON
1469-168608-0029 BUT HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEE THAT HOLLOW ROAD WHICH DID NOT EVEN FORM A WRINKLE ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLATEAU WARNED NEVERTHELESS AND PUT ON THE ALERT BY THE LITTLE WHITE CHAPEL
1469-168608-0030 HE HAD PROBABLY PUT A QUESTION AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF AN OBSTACLE TO THE GUIDE LACOSTE THE GUIDE HAD ANSWERED NO WE MIGHT ALMOST AFFIRM THAT NAPOLEON'S CATASTROPHE
1469-168608-0031 ORIGINATED IN THAT SIGN OF A PEASANT'S HEAD OTHER FATALITIES WERE DESTINED TO ARISE WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT NAPOLEON SHOULD HAVE WON THAT BATTLE WE ANSWER NO WHY
1469-168608-0032 BECAUSE OF WELLINGTON BECAUSE OF BLUCHER NO BECAUSE OF GOD BONAPARTE VICTOR AT WATERLOO THAT DOES NOT COME WITHIN THE LAW OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
1469-168608-0033 ANOTHER SERIES OF FACTS WAS IN PREPARATION IN WHICH THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ROOM FOR NAPOLEON
1469-168608-0034 THESE PLETHORAS OF ALL HUMAN VITALITY CONCENTRATED IN A SINGLE HEAD THE WORLD MOUNTING TO THE BRAIN OF ONE MAN THIS WOULD BE MORTAL TO CIVILIZATION WERE IT TO LAST
1469-168608-0035 THE MOMENT HAD ARRIVED FOR THE INCORRUPTIBLE AND SUPREME EQUITY TO ALTER ITS PLAN PROBABLY THE PRINCIPLES AND THE ELEMENTS
1469-168608-0036 HAD COMPLAINED SMOKING BLOOD OVER FILLED CEMETERIES MOTHERS IN TEARS THESE ARE FORMIDABLE PLEADERS WHEN THE EARTH IS SUFFERING FROM TOO HEAVY A BURDEN
1469-168608-0037 THERE ARE MYSTERIOUS GROANINGS OF THE SHADES TO WHICH THE ABYSS LENDS AN EAR NAPOLEON HAD BEEN DENOUNCED IN THE INFINITE AND HIS FALL HAD BEEN DECIDED ON HE EMBARRASSED GOD
1469-168608-0038 WATERLOO IS NOT A BATTLE
