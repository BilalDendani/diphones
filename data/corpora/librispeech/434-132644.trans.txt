434-132644-0016 WHO OFFERED TO AGREE WITH THEM UPON REASONABLE TERMS HE APPOINTED TO MEET THEM AT A PUBLIC HOUSE

434-132644-0021 CACAMBO APPLAUDED THIS WISE RESOLUTION HE DESPAIRED AT PARTING FROM SO GOOD A MASTER WHO HAD BECOME HIS INTIMATE FRIEND BUT THE PLEASURE OF SERVING HIM PREVAILED OVER THE PAIN OF LEAVING HIM THEY EMBRACED WITH TEARS
434-132644-0022 AFTER HE HAD HIRED DOMESTICS AND PURCHASED EVERYTHING NECESSARY FOR A LONG VOYAGE
434-132644-0023 OH OH SAID THE PRUDENT VANDERDENDUR TO HIMSELF THIS STRANGER GIVES TEN THOUSAND PIASTRES UNHESITATINGLY HE MUST BE VERY RICH RETURNING A LITTLE WHILE AFTER
434-132644-0024 HE LET HIM KNOW THAT UPON SECOND CONSIDERATION HE COULD NOT UNDERTAKE THE VOYAGE FOR LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND PIASTRES
434-132644-0025 AY SAID THE SKIPPER TO HIMSELF THIS MAN AGREES TO PAY TWENTY THOUSAND PIASTRES WITH AS MUCH EASE AS TEN HE WENT BACK TO HIM AGAIN AND DECLARED THAT HE COULD NOT CARRY HIM TO VENICE FOR LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND PIASTRES
434-132644-0026 OH OH SAID THE DUTCH SKIPPER ONCE MORE TO HIMSELF THIRTY THOUSAND PIASTRES ARE A TRIFLE TO THIS MAN SURELY THESE SHEEP MUST BE LADEN WITH AN IMMENSE TREASURE LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT
434-132644-0027 FIRST OF ALL LET HIM PAY DOWN THE THIRTY THOUSAND PIASTRES THEN WE SHALL SEE CANDIDE SOLD TWO SMALL DIAMONDS THE LEAST OF WHICH WAS WORTH MORE THAN WHAT THE SKIPPER ASKED FOR HIS FREIGHT HE PAID HIM IN ADVANCE
434-132644-0028 THE TWO SHEEP WERE PUT ON BOARD CANDIDE FOLLOWED IN A LITTLE BOAT TO JOIN THE VESSEL IN THE ROADS THE SKIPPER SEIZED HIS OPPORTUNITY SET SAIL AND PUT OUT TO SEA THE WIND FAVOURING HIM
434-132644-0029 ALAS SAID HE THIS IS A TRICK WORTHY OF THE OLD WORLD HE PUT BACK OVERWHELMED WITH SORROW FOR INDEED HE HAD LOST SUFFICIENT TO MAKE THE FORTUNE OF TWENTY MONARCHS HE WAITED UPON THE DUTCH MAGISTRATE
434-132644-0030 AND IN HIS DISTRESS HE KNOCKED OVER LOUDLY AT THE DOOR
434-132644-0031 THEN HE LISTENED PATIENTLY PROMISED TO EXAMINE INTO HIS AFFAIR AT THE SKIPPER'S RETURN AND ORDERED HIM TO PAY TEN THOUSAND PIASTRES FOR THE EXPENSE OF THE HEARING
434-132644-0032 HE HAD INDEED ENDURED MISFORTUNES A THOUSAND TIMES WORSE
434-132644-0033 AND FLUNG HIM INTO A DEEP MELANCHOLY THE VILLAINY OF MANKIND PRESENTED ITSELF BEFORE HIS IMAGINATION IN ALL ITS DEFORMITY AND HIS MIND WAS FILLED WITH GLOOMY IDEAS AT LENGTH HEARING THAT A FRENCH VESSEL WAS READY TO SET SAIL FOR BORDEAUX
434-132644-0034 AS HE HAD NO SHEEP LADEN WITH DIAMONDS TO TAKE ALONG WITH HIM HE HIRED A CABIN AT THE USUAL PRICE HE MADE IT KNOWN IN THE TOWN THAT HE WOULD PAY THE PASSAGE AND BOARD AND GIVE TWO THOUSAND PIASTRES TO ANY HONEST MAN WHO WOULD MAKE THE VOYAGE WITH HIM
434-132644-0035 UPON CONDITION THAT THIS MAN WAS THE MOST DISSATISFIED WITH HIS STATE AND THE MOST UNFORTUNATE IN THE WHOLE PROVINCE SUCH A CROWD OF CANDIDATES PRESENTED THEMSELVES THAT A FLEET OF SHIPS COULD HARDLY HAVE HELD THEM
434-132644-0036 CANDIDE BEING DESIROUS OF SELECTING FROM AMONG THE BEST MARKED OUT ABOUT ONE TWENTIETH OF THEM WHO SEEMED TO BE SOCIABLE MEN AND WHO ALL PRETENDED TO MERIT HIS PREFERENCE
434-132644-0037 PROMISING TO CHOOSE HIM WHO APPEARED TO BE MOST JUSTLY DISCONTENTED WITH HIS STATE AND TO BESTOW SOME PRESENTS UPON THE REST THEY SAT UNTIL FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
434-132644-0038 WAS REMINDED OF WHAT THE OLD WOMAN HAD SAID TO HIM IN THEIR VOYAGE TO BUENOS AYRES AND OF HER WAGER THAT THERE WAS NOT A PERSON ON BOARD THE SHIP BUT HAD MET WITH VERY GREAT MISFORTUNES HE DREAMED OF PANGLOSS AT EVERY ADVENTURE TOLD TO HIM
434-132644-0039 THIS PANGLOSS SAID HE WOULD BE PUZZLED TO DEMONSTRATE HIS SYSTEM I WISH THAT HE WERE HERE CERTAINLY IF ALL THINGS ARE GOOD IT IS IN EL DORADO AND NOT IN THE REST OF THE WORLD
434-132644-0040 AT LENGTH HE MADE CHOICE OF A POOR MAN OF LETTERS WHO HAD WORKED TEN YEARS FOR THE BOOKSELLERS OF AMSTERDAM HE JUDGED THAT THERE WAS NOT IN THE WHOLE WORLD A TRADE WHICH COULD DISGUST ONE MORE
434-132644-0041 THIS PHILOSOPHER WAS AN HONEST MAN BUT HE HAD BEEN ROBBED BY HIS WIFE BEATEN BY HIS SON AND ABANDONED BY HIS DAUGHTER WHO GOT A PORTUGUESE TO RUN AWAY WITH HER HE HAD JUST BEEN DEPRIVED OF A SMALL EMPLOYMENT ON WHICH HE SUBSISTED
434-132644-0042 WHO TOOK HIM FOR A SOCINIAN WE MUST ALLOW THAT THE OTHERS WERE AT LEAST AS WRETCHED AS HE
