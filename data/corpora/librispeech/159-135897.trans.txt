159-135897-0000 THE NAME OF THE OTHER IS SAFIE AND MY OWN ZOBEIDE AFTER OUR FATHER'S DEATH THE PROPERTY THAT HE LEFT WAS EQUALLY DIVIDED AMONG US AND
159-135897-0001 AS SOON AS THESE TWO SISTERS RECEIVED THEIR PORTIONS THEY LEFT ME TO LIVE WITH THEIR MOTHER MY OTHER TWO SISTERS AND MYSELF STAYED WITH OUR MOTHER WHO WAS THEN ALIVE AND WHO WHEN SHE AFTERWARDS DIED
159-135897-0002 FOR I AM THE YOUNGEST MARRIED AND LEFT ME ALONE SOME TIME AFTER MY ELDEST SISTER'S HUSBAND SOLD ALL THAT HE HAD AND WITH THAT MONEY AND MY SISTER'S PORTION THEY WENT BOTH INTO AFRICA WHERE HER HUSBAND
159-135897-0003 BY RIOTOUS LIVING AND DEBAUCHERY SPENT ALL AND FINDING HIMSELF REDUCED TO POVERTY FOUND A PRETEXT FOR DIVORCING MY SISTER
159-135897-0004 I RECEIVED HER WITH EVERY POSSIBLE TENDERNESS AND INQUIRING INTO THE CAUSE OF HER DISTRESS SHE TOLD ME WITH TEARS HOW INHUMANLY HER HUSBAND HAD BEHAVED TOWARDS HER HER MISFORTUNES AFFECTED ME AND I MINGLED MY TEARS WITH HERS
159-135897-0005 I TOOK HER TO A BATH CLOTHED HER WITH MY OWN APPAREL AND THUS ADDRESSED HER SISTER YOU ARE THE ELDER AND I ESTEEM YOU AS MY MOTHER DURING YOUR ABSENCE GOD HAS BLEST THE PORTION THAT FELL TO MY SHARE
159-135897-0006 AND THE EMPLOYMENT I FOLLOW OF BREEDING SILK WORMS ASSURE YOURSELF THERE IS NOTHING I HAVE BUT IS AT YOUR SERVICE AND AS MUCH AT YOUR DISPOSAL AS MY OWN WE LIVED VERY COMFORTABLY TOGETHER FOR SOME MONTHS
159-135897-0007 AS WE WERE ONE DAY CONVERSING ABOUT OUR THIRD SISTER AND WONDERING WE RECEIVED NO INTELLIGENCE OF HER
159-135897-0008 HER HUSBAND HAD TREATED HER AFTER THE SAME MANNER AND I RECEIVED HER LIKEWISE WITH THE SAME AFFECTION AS I HAD DONE THE FORMER SOME TIME AFTER MY TWO SISTERS
159-135897-0009 TOLD ME THEY INTENDED TO MARRY AGAIN I OBSERVED THAT IF PUTTING ME TO EXPENSE WAS THE ONLY REASON THEY MIGHT LAY THOSE THOUGHTS ASIDE AND BE WELCOME TO REMAIN FOR WHAT I HAD WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN US ALL THREE
159-135897-0010 IN A MANNER ANSWERABLE TO OUR CONDITION BUT I ADDED I RATHER BELIEVE YOU WISH TO MARRY AGAIN I SHALL FEEL MUCH SURPRISED IF SUCH BE THE CASE AFTER THE EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE HAD OF THE LITTLE SATISFACTION THERE IS IN WEDLOCK
159-135897-0011 IS IT POSSIBLE YOU DARE VENTURE A SECOND TIME YOU KNOW HOW RARE IT IS TO MEET WITH A HUSBAND PERFECTLY VIRTUOUS AND DESERVING BELIEVE WHAT I SAY AND LET US LIVE TOGETHER AS COMFORTABLY AS WE CAN
159-135897-0012 BUT ABUNDANTLY MORE WISE THAN WE IF YOU WILL VOUCHSAFE TO RECEIVE US ONCE MORE INTO YOUR HOUSE AND ACCOUNT US YOUR SLAVES WE SHALL NEVER COMMIT A SIMILAR FAULT AGAIN MY ANSWER WAS DEAR SISTERS
159-135897-0013 I HAVE NOT ALTERED MY MIND WITH RESPECT TO YOU SINCE WE LAST PARTED COME AGAIN AND TAKE PART OF WHAT I HAVE UPON THIS I EMBRACED THEM AND WE LIVED TOGETHER AS BEFORE
159-135897-0014 WE CONTINUED THUS A WHOLE YEAR IN PERFECT LOVE AND HARMONY SEEING THAT GOD HAD INCREASED MY SMALL STOCK I PROJECTED A VOYAGE TO EMBARK SOME OF IT IN A COMMERCIAL SPECULATION TO THIS END
159-135897-0015 WHERE I BOUGHT A SHIP READY FITTED FOR SEA
159-135897-0016 WE SET SAIL WITH A FAIR WIND AND SOON CLEARED THE PERSIAN GULF WHEN WE HAD REACHED THE OPEN SEA WE STEERED OUR COURSE TO THE INDIES AND THE TWENTIETH DAY SAW LAND IT WAS A VERY HIGH MOUNTAIN
159-135897-0017 AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH WE PERCEIVED A GREAT TOWN HAVING A FRESH GALE WE SOON REACHED THE HARBOUR AND CAST ANCHOR I HAD NOT PATIENCE TO WAIT TILL MY SISTERS WERE DRESSED TO GO ALONG WITH ME BUT WENT ASHORE ALONE IN THE BOAT
159-135897-0018 AND THEY HAD ALL SUCH DREADFUL COUNTENANCES THAT I WAS GREATLY ALARMED BUT PERCEIVING THEY REMAINED STATIONARY AND DID NOT SO MUCH AS MOVE THEIR EYES I TOOK COURAGE AND WENT NEARER WHEN I FOUND THEY WERE ALL TURNED INTO STONES
159-135897-0019 I ENTERED THE TOWN AND PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL STREETS WHERE AT DIFFERENT INTERVALS STOOD MEN IN VARIOUS ATTITUDES BUT ALL MOTIONLESS AND PETRIFIED IN THE QUARTER INHABITED BY THE MERCHANTS
159-135897-0020 I FOUND MOST OF THE SHOPS SHUT AND IN SUCH AS WERE OPEN I LIKEWISE FOUND THE PEOPLE PETRIFIED HAVING REACHED A VAST SQUARE IN THE HEART OF THE CITY I PERCEIVED A LARGE FOLDING GATE COVERED WITH PLATES OF GOLD
159-135897-0021 WHICH STOOD OPEN A CURTAIN OF SILK STUFF SEEMED TO BE DRAWN BEFORE IT A LAMP HUNG OVER THE ENTRANCE AFTER I HAD SURVEYED THE BUILDING I MADE NO DOUBT BUT IT WAS THE PALACE OF THE PRINCE WHO REIGNED OVER THAT COUNTRY
159-135897-0022 I APPROACHED IN HOPES TO FIND SOME
159-135897-0023 NO ONE BUT THE GUARDS IN THE VESTIBULE ALL PETRIFIED SOME STANDING SOME SITTING AND SOME LYING I CAME TO A LARGE COURT WHERE I SAW BEFORE ME A STATELY BUILDING THE WINDOWS OF WHICH WERE INCLOSED WITH GATES OF MESSY GOLD
159-135897-0024 I CONCLUDED IT TO BE THE QUEEN'S APARTMENTS I ENTERED AND IN A LARGE HALL I FOUND SEVERAL BLACK EUNUCHS TURNED INTO STONE I WENT FROM THENCE INTO A ROOM RICHLY FURNISHED
159-135897-0025 I STOOD SOME TIME ADMIRING THE RICHES AND MAGNIFICENCE OF THE ROOM BUT ABOVE ALL
159-135897-0026 AND AT LAST CAME INTO A LARGE ROOM WHERE THERE WAS A THRONE OF MASSIVE GOLD
159-135897-0027 AND UPON THE THRONE THERE WAS A BED OF RICH STUFF EMBROIDERED WITH PEARLS WHAT SURPRISED ME MOST WAS A SPARKLING LIGHT WHICH CAME FROM ABOVE THE BED BEING CURIOUS TO KNOW WHENCE IT PROCEEDED I ASCENDED THE STEPS
159-135897-0028 AND LIFTING UP MY HEAD SAW A DIAMOND AS LARGE AS THE EGG OF AN OSTRICH LYING UPON A LOW STOOL IT WAS SO PURE THAT I COULD NOT FIND THE LEAST BLEMISH IN IT AND IT SPARKLED WITH SO MUCH BRILLIANCY
159-135897-0029 HOWEVER IT MADE ME IMAGINE THAT THERE WAS SOME LIVING CREATURE IN THIS PLACE FOR I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THE TORCHES CONTINUED THUS BURNING OF THEMSELVES SEVERAL OTHER RARITIES DETAINED MY CURIOSITY IN THIS ROOM
159-135897-0030 WHICH WAS INESTIMABLE IN VALUE WERE IT ONLY FOR THE DIAMOND I MENTIONED THE DOORS BEING ALL OPEN OR BUT HALF SHUT I SURVEYED SOME OTHER APARTMENTS THAT WERE AS BEAUTIFUL AS THOSE I HAD ALREADY SEEN
159-135897-0031 AND THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT GRATIFYING MY CURIOSITY IN THE MEAN TIME NIGHT CAME ON WHICH REMINDED ME THAT IT WAS TIME TO RETIRE I PROPOSED TO RETURN THE WAY I HAD ENTERED BUT I COULD NOT FIND IT
159-135897-0032 I LOST MYSELF AMONG THE APARTMENTS AND PERCEIVING I WAS COME BACK AGAIN TO THE LARGE ROOM WHERE THE THRONE THE COUCH THE LARGE DIAMOND AND THE TORCHES STOOD I RESOLVED TO TAKE MY NIGHT'S LODGING THERE AND TO DEPART THE NEXT MORNING EARLY
159-135897-0033 TO GET ABOARD MY SHIP I LAID MYSELF DOWN UPON A COUCH NOT WITHOUT SOME DREAD TO BE ALONE IN A DESOLATE PLACE AND THIS FEAR HINDERED MY SLEEP ABOUT MIDNIGHT
159-135897-0034 AFTER THE SAME MANNER AND IN THE SAME TONE AS IT IS READ IN OUR MOSQUES BEING EXTREMELY GLAD TO HEAR IT I IMMEDIATELY AROSE AND TAKING A TORCH IN MY HAND PASSED FROM ONE CHAMBER TO ANOTHER
159-135897-0035 ON THAT SIDE FROM WHENCE THE SOUND PROCEEDED I CAME TO THE CLOSET DOOR AND STOOD STILL NOT DOUBTING THAT IT CAME FROM THENCE I SET DOWN MY TORCH UPON THE GROUND
159-135897-0036 AND TWO CANDLESTICKS WITH LARGE TAPERS OF WHITE WAX BURNING I SAW A LITTLE CARPET LAID DOWN LIKE THOSE WE HAVE TO KNEEL UPON WHEN WE SAY OUR PRAYERS AND A COMELY YOUNG MAN SAT ON THIS CARPET
159-135897-0037 READING WITH GREAT DEVOTION THE KORAUN WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM ON A DESK AT THIS SIGHT I WAS TRANSPORTED WITH ADMIRATION I WONDERED HOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT HE SHOULD BE THE ONLY LIVING CREATURE
159-135897-0038 THE DOOR BEING ONLY HALF SHUT I OPENED IT WENT IN AND STANDING UPRIGHT BEFORE THE NICHE I REPEATED THIS PRAYER ALOUD PRAISE BE TO GOD WHO HAS FAVOURED US WITH A HAPPY VOYAGE
159-135897-0039 AND MAY HE BE GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO PROTECT US IN THE SAME MANNER
159-135897-0040 HEAR ME O LORD AND GRANT MY REQUEST THE YOUNG MAN TURNED HIS EYES TOWARDS ME AND SAID MY GOOD LADY PRAY LET ME KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT HAS BROUGHT YOU TO THIS DESOLATE CITY
159-135897-0041 AND WHY I ALONE AM SAFE IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A TERRIBLE DISASTER I TOLD HIM IN A FEW WORDS WHENCE I HAD COME WHAT HAD MADE ME UNDERTAKE THE VOYAGE AND HOW I SAFELY ARRIVED AT THE PORT AFTER TWENTY DAYS SAILING
159-135897-0042 WHEN I HAD DONE I PRAYED HIM TO PERFORM HIS PROMISE AND TOLD HIM HOW MUCH I WAS STRUCK BY THE FRIGHTFUL DESOLATION WHICH I HAD SEEN IN THE CITY LADY SAID THE YOUNG MAN HAVE PATIENCE FOR A MOMENT
159-135897-0043 AT THESE WORDS HE SHUT THE KORAUN PUT IT INTO A RICH CASE AND LAID IT IN THE NICHE
159-135897-0044 AND PERCEIVING IN HIM SO MUCH GOOD NATURE AND BEAUTY I FELT EMOTIONS I HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE HE MADE ME SIT DOWN BY HIM AND BEFORE HE BEGAN HIS DISCOURSE I COULD NOT FORBEAR SAYING WITH AN AIR THAT DISCOVERED THE SENTIMENTS I FELT
159-135897-0045 YOU MUST KNOW THAT THIS CITY WAS THE METROPOLIS OF A MIGHTY KINGDOM OVER WHICH THE SULTAN MY FATHER REIGNED THAT PRINCE HIS WHOLE COURT THE INHABITANTS OF THE CITY AND ALL HIS OTHER SUBJECTS
159-135897-0046 WERE MAGI WORSHIPPERS OF FIRE AND OF NARDOUN THE ANCIENT KING OF THE GIANTS WHO REBELLED AGAINST GOD BUT THOUGH I WAS BORN OF AN IDOLATROUS FATHER AND MOTHER I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE IN MY YOUTH TO HAVE A GOVERNESS
159-135897-0047 AS SOON AS I WAS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING IT SHE EXPLAINED TO ME ALL THE PASSAGES OF THIS EXCELLENT BOOK AND INFUSED PIETY INTO MY MIND UNKNOWN TO MY FATHER OR ANY OTHER PERSON SHE HAPPENED TO DIE
159-135897-0048 BUT NOT BEFORE SHE HAD PERFECTLY INSTRUCTED ME IN ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY TO CONVINCE ME OF THE TRUTH OF THE MOOSULMAUN RELIGION AFTER HER DEATH I PERSISTED WITH CONSTANCY IN THE BELIEF OF ITS DIVINITY
159-135897-0049 THE WORDS WERE THESE INHABITANTS ABANDON THE WORSHIP OF NARDOUN AND OF FIRE AND WORSHIP THE ONLY GOD WHO SHEWS MERCY THIS VOICE WAS HEARD THREE YEARS SUCCESSIVELY BUT NO ONE WAS CONVERTED
159-135897-0050 FOR HE WAS METAMORPHOSED INTO A BLACK STONE AS HE IS TO BE SEEN IN THIS PALACE AND THE QUEEN MY MOTHER HAD THE LIKE DESTINY I AM THE ONLY PERSON WHO DID NOT SUFFER UNDER THAT HEAVY JUDGMENT
159-135897-0051 AND EVER SINCE I HAVE CONTINUED TO SERVE GOD WITH MORE FERVENCY THAN BEFORE I AM PERSUADED DEAR LADY THAT HE HAS SENT YOU HITHER FOR MY COMFORT FOR WHICH I RENDER HIM INFINITE THANKS FOR I MUST OWN
159-135897-0052 THAT THIS SOLITARY LIFE IS EXTREMELY IRKSOME ALL THESE EXPRESSIONS AND PARTICULARLY THE LAST GREATLY INCREASED MY LOVE FOR HIM PRINCE SAID I THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT PROVIDENCE HAS BROUGHT ME INTO YOUR PORT TO AFFORD YOU AN OPPORTUNITY
159-135897-0053 THE SHIP I CAME IN MAY SERVE IN SOME MEASURE TO CONVINCE YOU
159-135897-0054 AND I DARE ENGAGE TO PROMISE YOU SANCTUARY THERE UNTIL THE MIGHTY COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL
159-135897-0055 MY VESSEL IS AT YOUR SERVICE
159-135897-0056 HE ACCEPTED THE OFFER AND WE CONVERSED THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT CONCERNING OUR EMBARKATION AS SOON AS IT WAS DAY WE LEFT THE PALACE
159-135897-0057 AFTER I HAD PRESENTED MY SISTERS TO THE PRINCE I TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HINDERED MY RETURN THE DAY BEFORE HOW I HAD MET WITH THE YOUNG PRINCE HIS STORY AND THE CAUSE OF THE DESOLATION OF SO FINE A CITY
159-135897-0058 THE SEAMEN WERE TAKEN UP SEVERAL DAYS IN UNLADING THE MERCHANDIZE I BROUGHT WITH ME AND EMBARKING
159-135897-0059 SUCH AS JEWELS GOLD AND MONEY WE LEFT THE FURNITURE AND GOODS WHICH CONSISTED OF AN INFINITE QUANTITY OF PLATE
159-135897-0060 FOR IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED SEVERAL VESSELS MORE TO CONVEY TO BAGDAD
159-135897-0061 AFTER WE HAD LADEN THE VESSEL WITH WHAT WE THOUGHT MOST DESIRABLE WE TOOK SUCH PROVISIONS AND WATER ABOARD AS WERE NECESSARY FOR OUR VOYAGE
159-135897-0062 AT LAST WE SET SAIL WITH A WIND AS FAVOURABLE AS WE COULD WISH THE YOUNG PRINCE MY SISTERS AND MYSELF ENJOYED OURSELVES FOR SOME TIME VERY AGREEABLY BUT ALAS THIS GOOD UNDERSTANDING DID NOT LAST LONG
159-135897-0063 FOR MY SISTERS GREW JEALOUS OF THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE PRINCE AND MYSELF AND MALICIOUSLY ASKED ME ONE DAY WHAT WE SHOULD DO WITH HIM WHEN WE CAME TO BAGDAD I PERCEIVED IMMEDIATELY
159-135897-0064 THAT THEY PUT THIS QUESTION ON PURPOSE TO DISCOVER MY INCLINATIONS THEREFORE RESOLVING TO PUT IT OFF WITH A JEST I ANSWERED I WILL TAKE HIM FOR MY HUSBAND AND UPON THAT TURNING MYSELF TO THE PRINCE SAID
159-135897-0065 SIR I HUMBLY BEG OF YOU TO GIVE YOUR CONSENT FOR AS SOON AS WE COME TO BAGDAD I DESIRE TO OFFER YOU MY PERSON TO BE YOUR SLAVE
159-135897-0066 AND TO RESIGN MYSELF WHOLLY TO YOUR COMMANDS THE PRINCE REPLIED I KNOW NOT MADAM WHETHER YOU BE IN JEST OR NO BUT FOR MY PART I SERIOUSLY DECLARE BEFORE THESE LADIES YOUR SISTERS
159-135897-0067 AND PROVED TO BE A FLAT ON THE COAST WHICH WHEN DAY APPEARED I FOUND TO BE A DESERT ISLAND
159-135897-0068 I SOON DRIED MY CLOTHES IN THE SUN AND AS I WALKED ALONG I FOUND SEVERAL KINDS OF FRUIT AND LIKEWISE FRESH WATER WHICH GAVE ME SOME HOPES OF PRESERVING MY LIFE I HAD JUST LAID MYSELF DOWN TO REST IN A SHADE
159-135897-0069 AND HANGING OUT ITS TONGUE WHICH INDUCED ME TO CONCLUDE IT HAD RECEIVED SOME INJURY I INSTANTLY AROSE AND PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS PURSUED BY A LARGER SERPENT WHICH HAD HOLD OF ITS TAIL AND WAS ENDEAVOURING TO DEVOUR IT
159-135897-0070 WHICH I HIT UPON THE HEAD AND KILLED THE OTHER FINDING ITSELF AT LIBERTY TOOK WING AND FLEW AWAY I LOOKED AFTER IT FOR SOME TIME TILL IT DISAPPEARED I THEN SOUGHT ANOTHER SHADY SPOT FOR REPOSE AND FELL ASLEEP
159-135897-0071 JUDGE WHAT WAS MY SURPRISE WHEN I AWOKE TO SEE STANDING BY ME A BLACK WOMAN OF LIVELY AND AGREEABLE FEATURES WHO HELD IN HER HAND TWO BITCHES OF THE SAME COLOUR FASTENED TOGETHER I SAT UP
159-135897-0072 AND ASKED HER WHO SHE WAS I AM SAID SHE THE SERPENT WHOM YOU LATELY DELIVERED FROM MY MORTAL ENEMY
159-135897-0073 THE IMPORTANT SERVICES YOU HAVE RENDERED ME THAN BY WHAT I HAVE JUST DONE THE TREACHERY OF YOUR SISTERS WAS WELL KNOWN TO ME AND TO AVENGE YOUR WRONGS AS SOON AS I WAS LIBERATED BY YOUR GENEROUS ASSISTANCE
159-135897-0074 WHOM I HAVE TRANSFORMED INTO THIS SHAPE BUT THIS PUNISHMENT WILL NOT SUFFICE AND MY WILL IS THAT YOU TREAT THEM HEREAFTER
159-135897-0075 SHE DELIVERED TO ME THE TWO BITCHES AND SAID IF YOU WOULD NOT BE CHANGED INTO A SIMILAR FORM I COMMAND YOU IN THE NAME OF HIM THAT GOVERNS THE SEA TO GIVE EACH OF YOUR SISTERS EVERY NIGHT ONE HUNDRED LASHES WITH A ROD
159-135897-0076 AND THE YOUNG PRINCE WHOM THEY HAVE DROWNED I WAS FORCED TO PROMISE OBEDIENCE SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE WHIPPED THEM EVERY NIGHT THOUGH WITH REGRET WHEREOF YOUR MAJESTY HAS BEEN A WITNESS
159-135897-0077 MY TEARS TESTIFY WITH HOW MUCH SORROW AND RELUCTANCE
159-135897-0078 AND IN THIS YOUR MAJESTY MAY SEE I AM MORE TO BE PITIED THAN BLAMED IF THERE BE ANY THING ELSE RELATING TO MYSELF
159-135897-0079 WILL GIVE YOU FULL INFORMATION IN THE RELATION OF HER STORY AFTER THE CALIPH HAD HEARD ZOBEIDE WITH MUCH ASTONISHMENT
