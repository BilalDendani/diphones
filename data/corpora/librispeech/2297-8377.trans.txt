2297-8377-0000 THE PROGRESS OF THE DESTRUCTION THE CLOUD WHICH HAD SCATTERED SO DEEP A MURKINESS OVER THE DAY HAD NOW SETTLED INTO A SOLID AND IMPENETRABLE MASS IT RESEMBLED LESS EVEN THE THICKEST GLOOM OF A NIGHT IN THE OPEN AIR
2297-8377-0001 THAN THE CLOSE AND BLIND DARKNESS OF SOME NARROW ROOM BUT IN PROPORTION AS THE BLACKNESS GATHERED DID THE LIGHTNINGS AROUND VESUVIUS INCREASE IN THEIR VIVID AND SCORCHING GLARE
2297-8377-0002 NOR WAS THEIR HORRIBLE BEAUTY CONFINED TO THE USUAL HUES OF FIRE NO RAINBOW EVER RIVALLED THEIR VARYING AND PRODIGAL DYES NOW BRIGHTLY BLUE AS THE MOST AZURE DEPTH OF A SOUTHERN SKY
2297-8377-0003 NOW OF A LIVID AND SNAKELIKE GREEN DARTING RESTLESSLY TO AND FRO AS THE FOLDS OF AN ENORMOUS SERPENT
2297-8377-0004 GUSHING FORTH THROUGH THE COLUMNS OF SMOKE FAR AND WIDE AND LIGHTING UP THE WHOLE CITY FROM ARCH TO ARCH THEN SUDDENLY DYING INTO A SICKLY PALENESS LIKE THE GHOST OF THEIR OWN LIFE
2297-8377-0005 THE GRINDING AND HISSING MURMUR OF THE ESCAPING GASES THROUGH THE CHASMS OF THE DISTANT MOUNTAIN SOMETIMES THE CLOUD APPEARED TO BREAK FROM ITS SOLID MASS AND BY THE LIGHTNING TO ASSUME QUAINT AND VAST MIMICRIES OF HUMAN
2297-8377-0006 OR OF MONSTER SHAPES STRIDING ACROSS THE GLOOM HURTLING ONE UPON THE OTHER AND VANISHING SWIFTLY INTO THE TURBULENT ABYSS OF SHADE
2297-8377-0007 THE UNSUBSTANTIAL VAPORS WERE AS THE BODILY FORMS OF GIGANTIC FOES THE AGENTS OF TERROR AND OF DEATH THE ASHES IN MANY PLACES WERE ALREADY KNEE DEEP AND THE BOILING SHOWERS WHICH CAME FROM THE STEAMING BREATH OF THE VOLCANO
2297-8377-0008 FORCED THEIR WAY INTO THE HOUSES BEARING WITH THEM A STRONG AND SUFFOCATING VAPOR IN SOME PLACES IMMENSE FRAGMENTS OF ROCK HURLED UPON THE HOUSE ROOFS BORE DOWN ALONG THE STREETS MASSES OF CONFUSED RUIN
2297-8377-0009 WHICH YET MORE AND MORE WITH EVERY HOUR OBSTRUCTED THE WAY AND AS THE DAY ADVANCED THE MOTION OF THE EARTH WAS MORE SENSIBLY FELT THE FOOTING SEEMED TO SLIDE AND CREEP NOR COULD CHARIOT OR LITTER BE KEPT STEADY EVEN ON THE MOST LEVEL GROUND
2297-8377-0010 SOMETIMES THE HUGER STONES STRIKING AGAINST EACH OTHER AS THEY FELL BROKE INTO COUNTLESS FRAGMENTS EMITTING SPARKS OF FIRE WHICH CAUGHT WHATEVER WAS COMBUSTIBLE WITHIN THEIR REACH AND ALONG THE PLAINS BEYOND THE CITY
2297-8377-0011 THE DARKNESS WAS NOW TERRIBLY RELIEVED FOR SEVERAL HOUSES AND EVEN VINEYARDS HAD BEEN SET ON FLAMES AND AT VARIOUS INTERVALS THE FIRES ROSE SUDDENLY AND FIERCELY AGAINST THE SOLID GLOOM
2297-8377-0012 TO ADD TO THIS PARTIAL RELIEF OF THE DARKNESS THE CITIZENS HAD HERE AND THERE IN THE MORE PUBLIC PLACES SUCH AS THE PORTICOES OF TEMPLES AND THE ENTRANCES TO THE FORUM ENDEAVORED TO PLACE ROWS OF TORCHES
2297-8377-0013 BUT THESE RARELY CONTINUED LONG THE SHOWERS AND THE WINDS EXTINGUISHED THEM AND THE SUDDEN DARKNESS INTO WHICH THEIR SUDDEN BIRTH WAS CONVERTED HAD SOMETHING IN IT DOUBLY TERRIBLE AND DOUBLY IMPRESSING ON THE IMPOTENCE OF HUMAN HOPES
2297-8377-0014 THE LESSON OF DESPAIR FREQUENTLY BY THE MOMENTARY LIGHT OF THESE TORCHES PARTIES OF FUGITIVES ENCOUNTERED EACH OTHER SOME HURRYING TOWARDS THE SEA OTHERS FLYING FROM THE SEA BACK TO THE LAND
2297-8377-0015 FOR THE OCEAN HAD RETREATED RAPIDLY FROM THE SHORE AN UTTER DARKNESS LAY OVER IT AND UPON ITS GROANING AND TOSSING WAVES THE STORM OF CINDERS AND ROCK FELL WITHOUT THE PROTECTION WHICH THE STREETS AND ROOFS AFFORDED TO THE LAND
2297-8377-0016 WILD HAGGARD GHASTLY WITH SUPERNATURAL FEARS THESE GROUPS ENCOUNTERED EACH OTHER BUT WITHOUT THE LEISURE TO SPEAK TO CONSULT TO ADVISE FOR THE SHOWERS FELL NOW FREQUENTLY THOUGH NOT CONTINUOUSLY
2297-8377-0017 EXTINGUISHING THE LIGHTS WHICH SHOWED TO EACH BAND THE DEATHLIKE FACES OF THE OTHER AND HURRYING ALL TO SEEK REFUGE BENEATH THE NEAREST SHELTER THE WHOLE ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION WERE BROKEN UP EVER AND ANON
2297-8377-0018 BY THE FLICKERING LIGHTS YOU SAW THE THIEF HASTENING BY THE MOST SOLEMN AUTHORITIES OF THE LAW LADEN WITH AND FEARFULLY CHUCKLING OVER THE PRODUCE OF HIS SUDDEN GAINS IF IN THE DARKNESS WIFE WAS SEPARATED FROM HUSBAND
2297-8377-0019 OR PARENT FROM CHILD VAIN WAS THE HOPE OF REUNION EACH HURRIED BLINDLY AND CONFUSEDLY ON NOTHING IN ALL THE VARIOUS AND COMPLICATED MACHINERY OF SOCIAL LIFE WAS LEFT
2297-8377-0020 SAVE THE PRIMAL LAW OF SELF PRESERVATION THROUGH THIS AWFUL SCENE DID THE ATHENIAN WADE HIS WAY ACCOMPANIED BY IONE AND THE BLIND GIRL SUDDENLY A RUSH OF HUNDREDS IN THEIR PATH TO THE SEA SWEPT BY THEM
2297-8377-0021 NYDIA WAS TORN FROM THE SIDE OF GLAUCUS WHO WITH IONE WAS BORNE RAPIDLY ONWARD AND WHEN THE CROWD WHOSE FORMS THEY SAW NOT SO THICK WAS THE GLOOM WERE GONE NYDIA WAS STILL SEPARATED FROM THEIR SIDE
2297-8377-0022 GLAUCUS SHOUTED HER NAME NO ANSWER CAME THEY RETRACED THEIR STEPS IN VAIN THEY COULD NOT DISCOVER HER
2297-8377-0023 IT WAS EVIDENT SHE HAD BEEN SWEPT ALONG SOME OPPOSITE DIRECTION BY THE HUMAN CURRENT THEIR FRIEND THEIR PRESERVER WAS LOST AND HITHERTO NYDIA HAD BEEN THEIR GUIDE
2297-8377-0024 HER BLINDNESS RENDERED THE SCENE FAMILIAR TO HER ALONE ACCUSTOMED THROUGH A PERPETUAL NIGHT TO THREAD THE WINDINGS OF THE CITY SHE HAD LED THEM UNERRINGLY TOWARDS THE SEA SHORE BY WHICH THEY HAD RESOLVED TO HAZARD AN ESCAPE
2297-8377-0025 NOW WHICH WAY COULD THEY WEND ALL WAS RAYLESS TO THEM A MAZE WITHOUT A CLUE WEARIED DESPONDENT BEWILDERED THEY HOWEVER PASSED ALONG THE ASHES FALLING UPON THEIR HEADS
2297-8377-0026 THE FRAGMENTARY STONES DASHING UP IN SPARKLES BEFORE THEIR FEET ALAS ALAS MURMURED IONE I CAN GO NO FARTHER MY STEPS SINK AMONG THE SCORCHING CINDERS FLY DEAREST
2297-8377-0027 BELOVED FLY AND LEAVE ME TO MY FATE HUSH MY BETROTHED MY BRIDE DEATH WITH THEE IS SWEETER THAN LIFE WITHOUT THEE YET WHITHER OH WHITHER CAN WE DIRECT OURSELVES THROUGH THE GLOOM
2297-8377-0028 ALREADY IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE MADE BUT A CIRCLE AND ARE IN THE VERY SPOT WHICH WE QUITTED AN HOUR AGO O GODS YON ROCK SEE IT HATH RIVEN THE ROOF BEFORE US IT IS DEATH TO MOVE THROUGH THE STREETS
2297-8377-0029 THE PORTICO OF THE TEMPLE OF FORTUNE IS BEFORE US LET US CREEP BENEATH IT IT WILL PROTECT US FROM THE SHOWERS HE CAUGHT HIS BELOVED IN HIS ARMS AND WITH DIFFICULTY AND LABOR GAINED THE TEMPLE
2297-8377-0030 HE BORE HER TO THE REMOTER AND MORE SHELTERED PART OF THE PORTICO
2297-8377-0031 FROM THE LIGHTNING AND THE SHOWERS THE BEAUTY AND THE UNSELFISHNESS OF LOVE COULD HALLOW EVEN THAT DISMAL TIME WHO IS THERE SAID THE TREMBLING AND HOLLOW VOICE OF ONE WHO HAD PRECEDED THEM
2297-8377-0032 IN THEIR PLACE OF REFUGE YET WHAT MATTERS
2297-8377-0033 IONE TURNED AT THE SOUND OF THE VOICE AND WITH A FAINT SHRIEK COWERED AGAIN BENEATH THE ARMS OF GLAUCUS AND HE LOOKING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE VOICE BEHELD THE CAUSE OF HER ALARM
2297-8377-0034 THROUGH THE DARKNESS GLARED FORTH TWO BURNING EYES THE LIGHTNING FLASHED AND LINGERED ATHWART THE TEMPLE AND GLAUCUS WITH A SHUDDER PERCEIVED THE LION TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN DOOMED COUCHED BENEATH THE PILLARS AND CLOSE BESIDE IT
2297-8377-0035 UNWITTING OF THE VICINITY LAY THE GIANT FORM OF HIM WHO HAD ACCOSTED THEM THE WOUNDED GLADIATOR
2297-8377-0036 THAT LIGHTNING HAD REVEALED TO EACH OTHER THE FORM OF BEAST AND MAN YET THE INSTINCT OF BOTH WAS QUELLED NAY THE LION CREPT NEARER AND NEARER TO THE GLADIATOR AS FOR COMPANIONSHIP
2297-8377-0037 AND THE GLADIATOR DID NOT RECEDE OR TREMBLE THE REVOLUTION OF NATURE HAD DISSOLVED HER LIGHTER TERRORS AS WELL AS HER WONTED TIES WHILE THEY WERE THUS TERRIBLY PROTECTED
2297-8377-0038 A GROUP OF MEN AND WOMEN BEARING TORCHES PASSED BY THE TEMPLE
2297-8377-0039 AND A SUBLIME AND UNEARTHLY EMOTION HAD NOT INDEED QUELLED THEIR AWE BUT IT HAD ROBBED AWE OF FEAR THEY HAD LONG BELIEVED ACCORDING TO THE ERROR OF THE EARLY CHRISTIANS THAT THE LAST DAY WAS AT HAND
2297-8377-0040 THEY IMAGINED NOW THAT THE DAY HAD COME
2297-8377-0041 BEHOLD THE LORD DESCENDETH TO JUDGMENT HE MAKETH FIRE COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN IN THE SIGHT OF MEN
2297-8377-0042 WOE TO YE OF THE FASCES AND THE PURPLE WOE TO THE IDOLATER AND THE WORSHIPPER OF THE BEAST WOE TO YE WHO POUR FORTH THE BLOOD OF SAINTS AND GLOAT OVER THE DEATH PANGS OF THE SONS OF GOD WOE TO THE HARLOT OF THE SEA
2297-8377-0043 THE NAZARENES PACED SLOWLY ON THEIR TORCHES STILL FLICKERING IN THE STORM THEIR VOICES STILL RAISED IN MENACE AND SOLEMN WARNING TILL LOST AMID THE WINDINGS IN THE STREETS THE DARKNESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE
2297-8377-0044 AND THE SILENCE OF DEATH AGAIN FELL OVER THE SCENE THERE WAS ONE OF THE FREQUENT PAUSES IN THE SHOWERS AND GLAUCUS ENCOURAGED IONE ONCE MORE TO PROCEED JUST AS THEY STOOD HESITATING ON THE LAST STEP OF THE PORTICO
2297-8377-0045 AN OLD MAN WITH A BAG IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND LEANING UPON A YOUTH TOTTERED BY THE YOUTH BORE A TORCH GLAUCUS RECOGNIZED THE TWO AS FATHER AND SON MISER AND PRODIGAL FATHER SAID THE YOUTH

2297-8377-0048 AND FLED ONWARD WITH A SHRILL YELL
