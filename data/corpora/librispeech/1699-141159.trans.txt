1699-141159-0005 WE STAYED THREE DAYS AT CONCEPCION AND THEN SAILED FOR VALPARAISO THE WIND BEING NORTHERLY WE ONLY REACHED THE MOUTH OF THE HARBOUR OF CONCEPCION BEFORE IT WAS DARK
1699-141159-0006 CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAILED HIM IN A LOUD CLEAR VOICE TO ANCHOR WHERE HE THEN WAS
1699-141159-0007 SUCH A BABEL OF CRIES ISSUED AT ONCE FROM THE SHIP EVERY ONE HALLOOING OUT
1699-141159-0008 IF THE SHIP'S CREW HAD BEEN ALL CAPTAINS AND NO MEN THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A GREATER UPROAR OF ORDERS WE AFTERWARDS FOUND THAT THE MATE STUTTERED I SUPPOSE ALL HANDS WERE ASSISTING HIM IN GIVING HIS ORDERS ON THE ELEVENTH WE ANCHORED AT VALPARAISO
1699-141159-0009 AND TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS I SET OUT TO CROSS THE CORDILLERA I PROCEEDED TO SANTIAGO
1699-141159-0010 IN THIS PART OF CHILE THERE ARE TWO PASSES ACROSS THE ANDES TO MENDOZA THE ONE MOST COMMONLY USED NAMELY THAT OF ACONCAGUA OR USPALLATA IS SITUATED SOME WAY TO THE NORTH THE OTHER CALLED THE PORTILLO IS TO THE SOUTH AND NEARER BUT MORE LOFTY AND DANGEROUS
1699-141159-0011 LEAVING SANTIAGO WE CROSSED THE WIDE BURNT UP PLAIN ON WHICH THAT CITY STANDS AND IN THE AFTERNOON ARRIVED AT THE MAYPU ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL RIVERS IN CHILE THE VALLEY AT THE POINT WHERE IT ENTERS THE FIRST CORDILLERA
1699-141159-0012 IS BOUNDED ON EACH SIDE BY LOFTY BARREN MOUNTAINS AND ALTHOUGH NOT BROAD IT IS VERY FERTILE NUMEROUS COTTAGES WERE SURROUNDED BY VINES AND BY ORCHARDS OF APPLE NECTARINE AND PEACH TREES
1699-141159-0013 THE FRONTIER OF CHILE IS BETTER GUARDED BY THE CORDILLERA THAN BY THE WATERS OF THE SEA THERE ARE VERY FEW VALLEYS WHICH LEAD TO THE CENTRAL RANGES
1699-141159-0014 WHICH WAS PERHAPS PARTLY OWING TO THE PASSPORT WHICH THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAD GIVEN ME BUT I MUST EXPRESS MY ADMIRATION AT THE NATURAL POLITENESS OF ALMOST EVERY CHILENO IN THIS INSTANCE THE CONTRAST WITH THE SAME CLASS OF MEN IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES WAS STRONGLY MARKED
1699-141159-0015 WE MET NEAR MENDOZA A LITTLE AND VERY FAT NEGRESS RIDING ASTRIDE ON A MULE
1699-141159-0016 BUT MY TWO COMPANIONS ALMOST INSTANTLY BY WAY OF APOLOGY MADE THE COMMON SALUTE OF THE COUNTRY BY TAKING OFF THEIR HATS WHERE WOULD ONE OF THE LOWER OR HIGHER CLASSES IN EUROPE HAVE SHOWN SUCH FEELING POLITENESS TO A POOR AND MISERABLE OBJECT OF A DEGRADED RACE
1699-141159-0017 AT NIGHT WE SLEPT AT A COTTAGE OUR MANNER OF TRAVELLING WAS DELIGHTFULLY INDEPENDENT
1699-141159-0018 HIRED PASTURE FOR THE ANIMALS AND BIVOUACKED IN THE CORNER OF THE SAME FIELD WITH THEM CARRYING AN IRON POT WE COOKED AND ATE OUR SUPPER UNDER A CLOUDLESS SKY AND KNEW NO TROUBLE MY COMPANIONS WERE MARIANO GONZALES WHO HAD FORMERLY ACCOMPANIED ME IN CHILE
1699-141159-0019 AND AN ARRIERO WITH HIS TEN MULES AND A MADRINA THE MADRINA OR GODMOTHER IS A MOST IMPORTANT PERSONAGE SHE IS AN OLD STEADY MARE WITH A LITTLE BELL ROUND HER NECK AND WHEREVER SHE GOES THE MULES LIKE GOOD CHILDREN
1699-141159-0020 FOLLOW HER THE AFFECTION OF THESE ANIMALS FOR THEIR MADRINAS SAVES INFINITE TROUBLE IF SEVERAL LARGE TROOPS ARE TURNED INTO ONE FIELD TO GRAZE IN THE MORNING THE MULETEERS HAVE ONLY TO LEAD THE MADRINAS A LITTLE APART AND TINKLE THEIR BELLS
1699-141159-0021 ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE TWO OR THREE HUNDRED TOGETHER EACH MULE IMMEDIATELY KNOWS THE BELL OF ITS OWN MADRINA AND COMES TO HER IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO LOSE AN OLD MULE FOR IF DETAINED FOR SEVERAL HOURS BY FORCE SHE WILL BY THE POWER OF SMELL LIKE A DOG TRACK OUT HER COMPANIONS
1699-141159-0022 OR RATHER THE MADRINA FOR ACCORDING TO THE MULETEER SHE IS THE CHIEF OBJECT OF AFFECTION THE FEELING HOWEVER IS NOT OF AN INDIVIDUAL NATURE FOR I BELIEVE I AM RIGHT IN SAYING THAT ANY ANIMAL WITH A BELL WILL SERVE AS A MADRINA IN A TROOP EACH ANIMAL CARRIES ON A LEVEL ROAD
1699-141159-0023 A CARGO WEIGHING FOUR HUNDRED SIXTEEN POUNDS MORE THAN TWENTY NINE STONE BUT IN A MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY ONE HUNDRED POUNDS LESS YET WITH WHAT DELICATE SLIM LIMBS WITHOUT ANY PROPORTIONAL BULK OF MUSCLE THESE ANIMALS SUPPORT SO GREAT A BURDEN
1699-141159-0024 THE MULE ALWAYS APPEARS TO ME A MOST SURPRISING ANIMAL THAT A HYBRID SHOULD POSSESS MORE REASON MEMORY OBSTINACY SOCIAL AFFECTION POWERS OF MUSCULAR ENDURANCE AND LENGTH OF LIFE THAN EITHER OF ITS PARENTS
1699-141159-0025 SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT ART HAS HERE OUTDONE NATURE OF OUR TEN ANIMALS SIX WERE INTENDED FOR RIDING AND FOUR FOR CARRYING CARGOES EACH TAKING TURN ABOUT WE CARRIED A GOOD DEAL OF FOOD IN CASE WE SHOULD BE SNOWED UP AS THE SEASON WAS RATHER LATE FOR PASSING THE PORTILLO
1699-141159-0026 THE NUMBER OF INHABITANTS BECAME SCANTY BUT WHEREVER WATER COULD BE BROUGHT ON THE LAND IT WAS VERY FERTILE ALL THE MAIN VALLEYS IN THE CORDILLERA ARE CHARACTERIZED BY HAVING ON BOTH SIDES A FRINGE OR TERRACE OF SHINGLE AND SAND
1699-141159-0027 RUDELY STRATIFIED AND GENERALLY OF CONSIDERABLE THICKNESS THESE FRINGES EVIDENTLY ONCE EXTENDED ACROSS THE VALLEYS AND WERE UNITED AND THE BOTTOMS OF THE VALLEYS IN NORTHERN CHILE WHERE THERE ARE NO STREAMS ARE THUS SMOOTHLY FILLED UP
1699-141159-0028 ON THESE FRINGES THE ROADS ARE GENERALLY CARRIED FOR THEIR SURFACES ARE EVEN AND THEY RISE WITH A VERY GENTLE SLOPE UP THE VALLEYS HENCE ALSO THEY ARE EASILY CULTIVATED BY IRRIGATION THEY MAY BE TRACED UP TO A HEIGHT OF BETWEEN SEVEN THOUSAND AND NINE THOUSAND FEET
1699-141159-0029 WHERE THEY BECOME HIDDEN BY THE IRREGULAR PILES OF DEBRIS AT THE LOWER END OR MOUTHS OF THE VALLEYS THEY ARE CONTINUOUSLY UNITED TO THOSE LAND LOCKED PLAINS ALSO FORMED OF SHINGLE AT THE FOOT OF THE MAIN CORDILLERA
1699-141159-0030 AND WHICH WERE UNDOUBTEDLY DEPOSITED WHEN THE SEA PENETRATED CHILE AS IT NOW DOES THE MORE SOUTHERN COASTS
1699-141159-0031 THEY PRECISELY RESEMBLE IN COMPOSITION THE MATTER WHICH THE TORRENTS IN EACH VALLEY WOULD DEPOSIT IF THEY WERE CHECKED IN THEIR COURSE BY ANY CAUSE SUCH AS ENTERING A LAKE OR ARM OF THE SEA BUT THE TORRENTS INSTEAD OF DEPOSITING MATTER
1699-141159-0032 ARE NOW STEADILY AT WORK WEARING AWAY BOTH THE SOLID ROCK AND THESE ALLUVIAL DEPOSITS ALONG THE WHOLE LINE OF EVERY MAIN VALLEY AND SIDE VALLEY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE HERE TO GIVE THE REASONS
1699-141159-0033 DURING THE GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE CORDILLERA BY THE TORRENTS DELIVERING AT SUCCESSIVE LEVELS THEIR DETRITUS ON THE BEACHHEADS OF LONG NARROW ARMS OF THE SEA FIRST HIGH UP THE VALLEYS THEN LOWER AND LOWER DOWN AS THE LAND SLOWLY ROSE
1699-141159-0034 IF THIS BE SO AND I CANNOT DOUBT IT THE GRAND AND BROKEN CHAIN OF THE CORDILLERA INSTEAD OF HAVING BEEN SUDDENLY THROWN UP
1699-141159-0035 HAS BEEN SLOWLY UPHEAVED IN MASS IN THE SAME GRADUAL MANNER AS THE COASTS OF THE ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC HAVE RISEN WITHIN THE RECENT PERIOD A MULTITUDE OF FACTS IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE CORDILLERA ON THIS VIEW RECEIVE A SIMPLE EXPLANATION
1699-141159-0036 THE RIVERS WHICH FLOW IN THESE VALLEYS OUGHT RATHER TO BE CALLED MOUNTAIN TORRENTS THEIR INCLINATION IS VERY GREAT
1699-141159-0037 THE ROAR WHICH THE MAYPU MADE AS IT RUSHED OVER THE GREAT ROUNDED FRAGMENTS WAS LIKE THAT OF THE SEA AMIDST THE DIN OF RUSHING WATERS
1699-141159-0038 WAS MOST DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE EVEN FROM A DISTANCE THIS RATTLING NOISE NIGHT AND DAY MAY BE HEARD ALONG THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE TORRENT THE SOUND SPOKE ELOQUENTLY TO THE GEOLOGIST THE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF STONES WHICH STRIKING AGAINST EACH OTHER
1699-141159-0039 MADE THE ONE DULL UNIFORM SOUND WERE ALL HURRYING IN ONE DIRECTION IT WAS LIKE THINKING ON TIME WHERE THE MINUTE THAT NOW GLIDES PAST IS IRREVOCABLE
1699-141159-0040 THE OCEAN IS THEIR ETERNITY AND EACH NOTE OF THAT WILD MUSIC TOLD OF ONE MORE STEP TOWARDS THEIR DESTINY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE MIND TO COMPREHEND EXCEPT BY A SLOW PROCESS ANY EFFECT WHICH IS PRODUCED BY A CAUSE REPEATED SO OFTEN
1699-141159-0041 THAT THE MULTIPLIER ITSELF CONVEYS AN IDEA NOT MORE DEFINITE THAN THE SAVAGE IMPLIES WHEN HE POINTS TO THE HAIRS OF HIS HEAD AS OFTEN AS I HAVE SEEN BEDS OF MUD SAND AND SHINGLE ACCUMULATED TO THE THICKNESS OF MANY THOUSAND FEET
1699-141159-0042 COULD NEVER HAVE GROUND DOWN AND PRODUCED SUCH MASSES
1699-141159-0043 AND CALLING TO MIND THAT WHOLE RACES OF ANIMALS HAVE PASSED AWAY FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND THAT DURING THIS WHOLE PERIOD NIGHT AND DAY THESE STONES HAVE GONE RATTLING ONWARDS IN THEIR COURSE
1699-141159-0044 CAN ANY MOUNTAINS ANY CONTINENT WITHSTAND SUCH WASTE IN THIS PART OF THE VALLEY THE MOUNTAINS ON EACH SIDE WERE FROM THREE THOUSAND TO SIX THOUSAND OR EIGHT THOUSAND FEET HIGH WITH ROUNDED OUTLINES AND STEEP BARE FLANKS
1699-141159-0045 THE GENERAL COLOUR OF THE ROCK WAS DULLISH PURPLE AND THE STRATIFICATION VERY DISTINCT IF THE SCENERY WAS NOT BEAUTIFUL IT WAS REMARKABLE AND GRAND WE MET DURING THE DAY SEVERAL HERDS OF CATTLE WHICH MEN WERE DRIVING DOWN FROM THE HIGHER VALLEYS IN THE CORDILLERA
1699-141159-0046 THIS SIGN OF THE APPROACHING WINTER HURRIED OUR STEPS MORE THAN WAS CONVENIENT FOR GEOLOGIZING
1699-141159-0047 SIR F HEAD MARVELS HOW MINES HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN SUCH EXTRAORDINARY SITUATIONS
1699-141159-0048 HENCE DURING THE GRADUAL WEAR OF THE HILLS THEY PROJECT ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND
1699-141159-0049 THE VEIN OCCURRED AT NO GREAT DISTANCE STANDING UP LIKE A WEDGE OF METAL THE MINERS ALSO TAKING A CROWBAR WITH THEM OFTEN WANDER ON SUNDAYS OVER THE MOUNTAINS IN THIS SOUTH PART OF CHILE THE MEN WHO DRIVE CATTLE INTO THE CORDILLERA
1699-141159-0050 AND WHO FREQUENT EVERY RAVINE WHERE THERE IS A LITTLE PASTURE ARE THE USUAL DISCOVERERS
1699-141159-0051 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW PRETTY ALPINE FLOWERS BECAME EXCEEDINGLY SCANTY AND OF QUADRUPEDS BIRDS OR INSECTS SCARCELY ONE COULD BE SEEN THE LOFTY MOUNTAINS THEIR SUMMITS MARKED WITH A FEW PATCHES OF SNOW STOOD WELL SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER
1699-141159-0052 THE VALLEYS BEING FILLED UP WITH AN IMMENSE THICKNESS OF STRATIFIED ALLUVIUM THE FEATURES IN THE SCENERY OF THE ANDES WHICH STRUCK ME MOST AS CONTRASTED WITH THE OTHER MOUNTAIN CHAINS WITH WHICH I AM ACQUAINTED WERE THE FLAT FRINGES SOMETIMES EXPANDING INTO NARROW PLAINS ON EACH SIDE OF THE VALLEYS
1699-141159-0053 THE BRIGHT COLOURS CHIEFLY RED AND PURPLE OF THE UTTERLY BARE AND PRECIPITOUS HILLS OF PORPHYRY THE GRAND AND CONTINUOUS WALL LIKE DYKES THE PLAINLY DIVIDED STRATA WHICH WHERE NEARLY VERTICAL FORMED THE PICTURESQUE AND WILD CENTRAL PINNACLES
1699-141159-0054 BUT WHERE LESS INCLINED COMPOSED THE GREAT MASSIVE MOUNTAINS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE RANGE AND LASTLY THE SMOOTH CONICAL PILES OF FINE AND BRIGHTLY COLOURED DETRITUS WHICH SLOPED UP AT A HIGH ANGLE FROM THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAINS SOMETIMES TO A HEIGHT OF MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND FEET
1699-141159-0055 I FREQUENTLY OBSERVED BOTH IN TIERRA DEL FUEGO AND WITHIN THE ANDES THAT WHERE THE ROCK WAS COVERED DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE YEAR WITH SNOW IT WAS SHIVERED IN A VERY EXTRAORDINARY MANNER INTO SMALL ANGULAR FRAGMENTS
1699-141159-0056 THE CASE APPEARS TO ME RATHER OBSCURE FOR THAT PART OF THE MOUNTAIN WHICH IS PROTECTED BY A MANTLE OF SNOW MUST BE LESS SUBJECT TO REPEATED AND GREAT CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE THAN ANY OTHER PART
1699-141159-0057 AND THEREFORE THAT THE APPEARANCE OF A QUICKER DISINTEGRATION OF THE SOLID ROCK UNDER THE SNOW WAS DECEPTIVE WHATEVER
1699-141159-0058 THE QUANTITY OF CRUMBLING STONE ON THE CORDILLERA IS VERY GREAT OCCASIONALLY IN THE SPRING GREAT MASSES OF THIS DETRITUS SLIDE DOWN THE MOUNTAINS AND COVER THE SNOW DRIFTS IN THE VALLEYS THUS FORMING NATURAL ICE HOUSES
1699-141159-0059 WE RODE OVER ONE THE HEIGHT OF WHICH WAS FAR BELOW THE LIMIT OF PERPETUAL SNOW AS THE EVENING DREW TO A CLOSE WE REACHED A SINGULAR BASIN LIKE PLAIN
1699-141159-0060 IT WAS COVERED BY A LITTLE DRY PASTURE AND WE HAD THE PLEASANT SIGHT OF A HERD OF CATTLE AMIDST THE SURROUNDING ROCKY DESERTS THE VALLEY TAKES ITS NAME OF YESO FROM A GREAT BED I SHOULD THINK AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND FEET THICK OF WHITE AND IN SOME PARTS QUITE PURE GYPSUM
1699-141159-0061 WE SLEPT WITH A PARTY OF MEN WHO WERE EMPLOYED IN LOADING MULES WITH THIS SUBSTANCE WHICH IS USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF WINE WE SET OUT EARLY IN THE MORNING TWENTY FIRST AND CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THE COURSE OF THE RIVER WHICH HAD BECOME VERY SMALL
1699-141159-0062 TILL WE ARRIVED AT THE FOOT OF THE RIDGE THAT SEPARATES THE WATERS FLOWING INTO THE PACIFIC AND ATLANTIC OCEANS THE ROAD WHICH AS YET HAD BEEN GOOD WITH A STEADY BUT VERY GRADUAL ASCENT NOW CHANGED INTO A STEEP ZIGZAG TRACK UP THE GREAT RANGE
1699-141159-0063 DIVIDING THE REPUBLICS OF CHILE AND MENDOZA I WILL HERE GIVE A VERY BRIEF SKETCH OF THE GEOLOGY OF THE SEVERAL PARALLEL LINES FORMING THE CORDILLERA OF THESE LINES THERE ARE TWO CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THE OTHERS NAMELY
1699-141159-0064 ON THE CHILIAN SIDE THE PEUQUENES RIDGE WHICH WHERE THE ROAD CROSSES IT IS THIRTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TEN FEET ABOVE THE SEA AND THE PORTILLO RIDGE ON THE MENDOZA SIDE WHICH IS FOURTEEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIVE FEET
1699-141159-0065 THE LOWER BEDS OF THE PEUQUENES RIDGE AND OF THE SEVERAL GREAT LINES TO THE WESTWARD OF IT ARE COMPOSED OF A VAST PILE MANY THOUSAND FEET IN THICKNESS OF PORPHYRIES WHICH HAVE FLOWED AS SUBMARINE LAVAS
1699-141159-0066 ALTERNATING WITH ANGULAR AND ROUNDED FRAGMENTS OF THE SAME ROCKS THROWN OUT OF THE SUBMARINE CRATERS THESE ALTERNATING MASSES ARE COVERED IN THE CENTRAL PARTS BY A GREAT THICKNESS OF RED SANDSTONE CONGLOMERATE
1699-141159-0067 ASSOCIATED WITH AND PASSING INTO PRODIGIOUS BEDS OF GYPSUM
1699-141159-0068 AND THEY BELONG TO ABOUT THE PERIOD OF THE LOWER CHALK OF EUROPE IT IS AN OLD STORY BUT NOT THE LESS WONDERFUL TO HEAR OF SHELLS WHICH WERE ONCE CRAWLING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA NOW STANDING NEARLY FOURTEEN THOUSAND FEET ABOVE ITS LEVEL THE LOWER BEDS IN THIS GREAT PILE OF STRATA
1699-141159-0069 HAVE BEEN DISLOCATED BAKED CRYSTALLIZED AND ALMOST BLENDED TOGETHER THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MOUNTAIN MASSES OF A PECULIAR WHITE SODA GRANITIC ROCK THE OTHER MAIN LINE NAMELY THAT OF THE PORTILLO IS OF A TOTALLY DIFFERENT FORMATION
1699-141159-0070 IT CONSISTS CHIEFLY OF GRAND BARE PINNACLES OF A RED POTASH GRANITE WHICH LOW DOWN ON THE WESTERN FLANK ARE COVERED BY A SANDSTONE CONVERTED BY THE FORMER HEAT INTO A QUARTZ ROCK
1699-141159-0071 ON THE QUARTZ THERE REST BEDS OF A CONGLOMERATE SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET IN THICKNESS WHICH HAVE BEEN UPHEAVED BY THE RED GRANITE
1699-141159-0072 WITH THEIR FOSSIL SHELLS OF THE PEUQUENES RANGE AND PARTLY OF RED POTASH GRANITE LIKE THAT OF THE PORTILLO HENCE WE MUST CONCLUDE THAT BOTH THE PEUQUENES AND PORTILLO RANGES WERE PARTIALLY UPHEAVED AND EXPOSED TO WEAR AND TEAR WHEN THE CONGLOMERATE WAS FORMING
1699-141159-0073 BY THE RED PORTILLO GRANITE WITH THE UNDERLYING SANDSTONE BAKED BY IT WE MAY FEEL SURE THAT THE GREATER PART OF THE INJECTION AND UPHEAVAL OF THE ALREADY PARTIALLY FORMED PORTILLO LINE TOOK PLACE AFTER THE ACCUMULATION OF THE CONGLOMERATE AND LONG AFTER THE ELEVATION OF THE PEUQUENES RIDGE
1699-141159-0074 SO THAT THE PORTILLO THE LOFTIEST LINE IN THIS PART OF THE CORDILLERA
1699-141159-0075 EVIDENCE DERIVED FROM AN INCLINED STREAM OF LAVA AT THE EASTERN BASE OF THE PORTILLO
1699-141159-0076 LOOKING TO ITS EARLIEST ORIGIN
1699-141159-0077 IN MOST PARTS PERHAPS IN ALL PARTS OF THE CORDILLERA IT MAY BE CONCLUDED THAT EACH LINE HAS BEEN FORMED BY REPEATED UPHEAVALS AND INJECTIONS
1699-141159-0078 ONLY THUS CAN WE GAIN TIME AT ALL SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN THE TRULY ASTONISHING AMOUNT OF DENUDATION WHICH THESE GREAT THOUGH COMPARATIVELY WITH MOST OTHER RANGES RECENT MOUNTAINS HAVE SUFFERED FINALLY
1699-141159-0079 THE SHELLS IN THE PEUQUENES OR OLDEST RIDGE PROVE AS BEFORE REMARKED THAT IT HAS BEEN UPRAISED FOURTEEN THOUSAND FEET SINCE A SECONDARY PERIOD
1699-141159-0080 BUT SINCE THESE SHELLS LIVED IN A MODERATELY DEEP SEA IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT THE AREA NOW OCCUPIED BY THE CORDILLERA MUST HAVE SUBSIDED SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET IN NORTHERN CHILE AS MUCH AS SIX THOUSAND FEET
1699-141159-0081 SO AS TO HAVE ALLOWED THAT AMOUNT OF SUBMARINE STRATA TO HAVE BEEN HEAPED ON THE BED ON WHICH THE SHELLS LIVED THE PROOF IS THE SAME WITH THAT BY WHICH IT WAS SHOWN
1699-141159-0082 DAILY IT IS FORCED HOME ON THE MIND OF THE GEOLOGIST THAT NOTHING NOT EVEN THE WIND THAT BLOWS IS SO UNSTABLE AS THE LEVEL OF THE CRUST OF THIS EARTH I WILL MAKE ONLY ONE OTHER GEOLOGICAL REMARK
1699-141159-0083 ALTHOUGH THE PORTILLO CHAIN IS HERE HIGHER THAN THE PEUQUENES THE WATERS DRAINING THE INTERMEDIATE VALLEYS HAVE BURST THROUGH IT THE SAME FACT ON A GRANDER SCALE HAS BEEN REMARKED IN THE EASTERN AND LOFTIEST LINE OF THE BOLIVIAN CORDILLERA THROUGH WHICH THE RIVERS PASS
1699-141159-0084 ANALOGOUS FACTS HAVE ALSO BEEN OBSERVED IN OTHER QUARTERS OF THE WORLD ON THE SUPPOSITION OF THE SUBSEQUENT AND GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE PORTILLO LINE THIS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD FOR A CHAIN OF ISLETS WOULD AT FIRST APPEAR AND AS THESE WERE LIFTED UP
1699-141159-0085 THE TIDES WOULD BE ALWAYS WEARING DEEPER AND BROADER CHANNELS BETWEEN THEM AT THE PRESENT DAY EVEN IN THE MOST RETIRED SOUNDS ON THE COAST OF TIERRA DEL FUEGO THE CURRENTS IN THE TRANSVERSE BREAKS WHICH CONNECT THE LONGITUDINAL CHANNELS ARE VERY STRONG
1699-141159-0086 SO THAT IN ONE TRANSVERSE CHANNEL EVEN A SMALL VESSEL UNDER SAIL WAS WHIRLED ROUND AND ROUND ABOUT NOON WE BEGAN THE TEDIOUS ASCENT OF THE PEUQUENES RIDGE AND THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME EXPERIENCED SOME LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN OUR RESPIRATION
1699-141159-0087 THE MULES WOULD HALT EVERY FIFTY YARDS AND AFTER RESTING FOR A FEW SECONDS THE POOR WILLING ANIMALS STARTED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AGAIN THE SHORT BREATHING FROM THE RAREFIED ATMOSPHERE IS CALLED BY THE CHILENOS PUNA
1699-141159-0088 SOME SAY ALL THE WATERS HERE HAVE PUNA OTHERS THAT WHERE THERE IS SNOW THERE IS PUNA AND THIS NO DOUBT IS TRUE THE ONLY SENSATION I EXPERIENCED WAS A SLIGHT TIGHTNESS ACROSS THE HEAD AND CHEST
1699-141159-0089 LIKE THAT FELT ON LEAVING A WARM ROOM AND RUNNING QUICKLY IN FROSTY WEATHER THERE WAS SOME IMAGINATION EVEN IN THIS FOR UPON FINDING FOSSIL SHELLS ON THE HIGHEST RIDGE I ENTIRELY FORGOT THE PUNA IN MY DELIGHT CERTAINLY THE EXERTION OF WALKING WAS EXTREMELY GREAT
1699-141159-0090 AND THE RESPIRATION BECAME DEEP AND LABORIOUS I AM TOLD THAT IN POTOSI ABOUT THIRTEEN THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA STRANGERS DO NOT BECOME THOROUGHLY ACCUSTOMED TO THE ATMOSPHERE FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR THE INHABITANTS ALL RECOMMEND ONIONS FOR THE PUNA
1699-141159-0091 AS THIS VEGETABLE HAS SOMETIMES BEEN GIVEN IN EUROPE FOR PECTORAL COMPLAINTS IT MAY POSSIBLY BE OF REAL SERVICE FOR MY PART I FOUND NOTHING SO GOOD AS THE FOSSIL SHELLS WHEN ABOUT HALF WAY UP WE MET A LARGE PARTY WITH SEVENTY LOADED MULES
1699-141159-0092 IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR THE WILD CRIES OF THE MULETEERS AND TO WATCH THE LONG DESCENDING STRING OF THE ANIMALS THEY APPEARED SO DIMINUTIVE THERE BEING NOTHING BUT THE BLACK MOUNTAINS WITH WHICH THEY COULD BE COMPARED WHEN NEAR THE SUMMIT THE WIND AS GENERALLY HAPPENS
1699-141159-0093 WAS IMPETUOUS AND EXTREMELY COLD ON EACH SIDE OF THE RIDGE WE HAD TO PASS OVER BROAD BANDS OF PERPETUAL SNOW WHICH WERE NOW SOON TO BE COVERED BY A FRESH LAYER WHEN WE REACHED THE CREST AND LOOKED BACKWARDS A GLORIOUS VIEW WAS PRESENTED
1699-141159-0094 THE ATMOSPHERE RESPLENDENTLY CLEAR THE SKY AN INTENSE BLUE THE PROFOUND VALLEYS THE WILD BROKEN FORMS THE HEAPS OF RUINS PILED UP DURING THE LAPSE OF AGES THE BRIGHT COLOURED ROCKS CONTRASTED WITH THE QUIET MOUNTAINS OF SNOW
1699-141159-0095 NEITHER PLANT NOR BIRD EXCEPTING A FEW CONDORS WHEELING AROUND THE HIGHER PINNACLES DISTRACTED MY ATTENTION FROM THE INANIMATE MASS I FELT GLAD THAT I WAS ALONE IT WAS LIKE WATCHING A THUNDERSTORM OR HEARING IN FULL ORCHESTRA A CHORUS OF THE MESSIAH
1699-141159-0096 ON SEVERAL PATCHES OF THE SNOW I FOUND THE PROTOCOCCUS NIVALIS OR RED SNOW SO WELL KNOWN FROM THE ACCOUNTS OF ARCTIC NAVIGATORS MY ATTENTION WAS CALLED TO IT BY OBSERVING THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE MULES STAINED A PALE RED
1699-141159-0097 AS IF THEIR HOOFS HAD BEEN SLIGHTLY BLOODY I AT FIRST THOUGHT THAT IT WAS OWING TO DUST BLOWN FROM THE SURROUNDING MOUNTAINS OF RED PORPHYRY FOR FROM THE MAGNIFYING POWER OF THE CRYSTALS OF SNOW THE GROUPS OF THESE MICROSCOPICAL PLANTS APPEARED LIKE COARSE PARTICLES
1699-141159-0098 THE SNOW WAS COLOURED ONLY WHERE IT HAD THAWED VERY RAPIDLY OR HAD BEEN ACCIDENTALLY CRUSHED A LITTLE RUBBED ON PAPER GAVE IT A FAINT ROSE TINGE MINGLED WITH A LITTLE BRICK RED I AFTERWARDS SCRAPED SOME OFF THE PAPER AND FOUND THAT IT CONSISTED OF GROUPS OF LITTLE SPHERES IN COLOURLESS CASES
1699-141159-0099 EACH OF THE THOUSANDTH PART OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER THE WIND ON THE CREST OF THE PEUQUENES AS JUST REMARKED IS GENERALLY IMPETUOUS AND VERY COLD
1699-141159-0100 THIS WIND MUST BE AN UPPER AND RETURN CURRENT
1699-141159-0101 IN LIKE MANNER FALLS WITHIN AN UPPER RETURN STREAM AT FIRST IT APPEARS RATHER SURPRISING THAT THE TRADE WIND ALONG THE NORTHERN PARTS OF CHILE AND ON THE COAST OF PERU SHOULD BLOW IN SO VERY SOUTHERLY A DIRECTION AS IT DOES
1699-141159-0102 BUT WHEN WE REFLECT THAT THE CORDILLERA RUNNING IN A NORTH AND SOUTH LINE INTERCEPTS LIKE A GREAT WALL THE ENTIRE DEPTH OF THE LOWER ATMOSPHERIC CURRENT WE CAN EASILY SEE THAT THE TRADE WIND MUST BE DRAWN NORTHWARD FOLLOWING THE LINE OF MOUNTAINS TOWARDS THE EQUATORIAL REGIONS
1699-141159-0103 AND THUS LOSE PART OF THAT EASTERLY MOVEMENT WHICH IT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE GAINED FROM THE EARTH'S ROTATION AT MENDOZA ON THE EASTERN FOOT OF THE ANDES
1699-141159-0104 WE MAY IMAGINE THAT THE WIND WHICH COMING FROM THE EASTWARD IS THUS BANKED UP BY THE LINE OF MOUNTAINS WOULD BECOME STAGNANT AND IRREGULAR IN ITS MOVEMENTS
1699-141159-0105 AND THEN TOOK UP OUR QUARTERS FOR THE NIGHT WE WERE NOW IN THE REPUBLIC OF MENDOZA THE ELEVATION WAS PROBABLY NOT UNDER ELEVEN THOUSAND FEET AND THE VEGETATION IN CONSEQUENCE EXCEEDINGLY SCANTY THE ROOT OF A SMALL SCRUBBY PLANT SERVED AS FUEL
1699-141159-0106 BUT IT MADE A MISERABLE FIRE AND THE WIND WAS PIERCINGLY COLD BEING QUITE TIRED WITH MY DAYS WORK I MADE UP MY BED AS QUICKLY AS I COULD AND WENT TO SLEEP ABOUT MIDNIGHT I OBSERVED THE SKY BECAME SUDDENLY CLOUDED
1699-141159-0107 I AWAKENED THE ARRIERO TO KNOW IF THERE WAS ANY DANGER OF BAD WEATHER
1699-141159-0108 THE PERIL IS IMMINENT AND THE DIFFICULTY OF SUBSEQUENT ESCAPE GREAT TO ANY ONE OVERTAKEN BY BAD WEATHER BETWEEN THE TWO RANGES A CERTAIN CAVE OFFERS THE ONLY PLACE OF REFUGE
1699-141159-0109 WAS DETAINED THERE FOR SOME TIME BY A HEAVY FALL OF SNOW CASUCHAS OR HOUSES OF REFUGE HAVE NOT BEEN BUILT IN THIS PASS AS IN THAT OF USPALLATA AND THEREFORE DURING THE AUTUMN THE PORTILLO IS LITTLE FREQUENTED
1699-141159-0110 I MAY HERE REMARK THAT WITHIN THE MAIN CORDILLERA RAIN NEVER FALLS FOR DURING THE SUMMER THE SKY IS CLOUDLESS AND IN WINTER SNOW STORMS ALONE OCCUR AT THE PLACE WHERE WE SLEPT WATER NECESSARILY BOILED FROM THE DIMINISHED PRESSURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE
1699-141159-0111 AT A LOWER TEMPERATURE THAN IT DOES IN A LESS LOFTY COUNTRY THE CASE BEING THE CONVERSE OF THAT OF A PAPIN'S DIGESTER HENCE THE POTATOES AFTER REMAINING FOR SOME HOURS IN THE BOILING WATER WERE NEARLY AS HARD AS EVER THE POT WAS LEFT ON THE FIRE ALL NIGHT
1699-141159-0112 AND NEXT MORNING IT WAS BOILED AGAIN BUT YET THE POTATOES WERE NOT COOKED
