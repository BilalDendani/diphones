252-128411-0000 THE AWFUL GERMAN LANGUAGE
252-128411-0001 LITTLE LEARNING MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD KIN PROVERBS
252-128411-0002 AND ONE DAY I SURPRISED THE KEEPER OF IT WITH MY GERMAN I SPOKE ENTIRELY IN THAT LANGUAGE HE WAS GREATLY INTERESTED
252-128411-0003 VERY RARE POSSIBLY A UNIQUE AND WANTED TO ADD IT TO HIS MUSEUM IF HE HAD KNOWN WHAT IT HAD COST ME TO ACQUIRE MY ART
252-128411-0004 HE WOULD ALSO HAVE KNOWN THAT IT WOULD BREAK ANY COLLECTOR TO BUY IT HARRIS AND I HAD BEEN HARD AT WORK ON OUR GERMAN DURING SEVERAL WEEKS AT THAT TIME AND ALTHOUGH WE HAD MADE GOOD PROGRESS
252-128411-0005 IT HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED UNDER GREAT DIFFICULTY AND ANNOYANCE FOR THREE OF OUR TEACHERS HAD DIED IN THE MEAN TIME A PERSON WHO HAS NOT STUDIED GERMAN CAN FORM NO IDEA
252-128411-0006 OF WHAT A PERPLEXING LANGUAGE IT IS SURELY THERE IS NOT ANOTHER LANGUAGE THAT IS SO SLIPSHOD AND SYSTEMLESS AND SO SLIPPERY AND ELUSIVE TO THE GRASP ONE IS WASHED ABOUT IN IT
252-128411-0007 HITHER AND THITHER IN THE MOST HELPLESS WAY AND WHEN AT LAST HE THINKS HE HAS CAPTURED A RULE WHICH OFFERS FIRM GROUND TO TAKE A REST ON AMID THE GENERAL RAGE AND TURMOIL
252-128411-0008 OF THE TEN PARTS OF SPEECH HE TURNS OVER THE PAGE AND READS LET THE PUPIL MAKE CAREFUL NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTIONS HE RUNS HIS EYE DOWN
252-128411-0009 AND FINDS THAT THERE ARE MORE EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE THAN INSTANCES OF IT SO OVERBOARD HE GOES AGAIN TO HUNT FOR ANOTHER ARARAT AND FIND ANOTHER QUICKSAND SUCH HAS BEEN
252-128411-0010 INTRUDES ITSELF INTO MY SENTENCE CLOTHED WITH AN AWFUL AND UNSUSPECTED POWER AND CRUMBLES THE GROUND FROM UNDER ME FOR INSTANCE MY BOOK INQUIRES AFTER A CERTAIN BIRD
252-128411-0011 IT IS ALWAYS INQUIRING AFTER THINGS WHICH ARE OF NO SORT OF CONSEQUENCE TO ANYBODY WHERE IS THE BIRD NOW THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION ACCORDING TO THE BOOK IS
252-128411-0012 THAT THE BIRD IS WAITING IN THE BLACKSMITH SHOP ON ACCOUNT OF THE RAIN OF COURSE NO BIRD WOULD DO THAT BUT THEN YOU MUST STICK TO THE BOOK VERY WELL
252-128411-0013 I BEGIN TO CIPHER OUT THE GERMAN FOR THAT ANSWER I BEGIN AT THE WRONG END NECESSARILY FOR THAT IS THE GERMAN IDEA I SAY TO MYSELF
252-128411-0014 ACCORDING TO WHICH GENDER IT MAY TURN OUT TO BE WHEN I LOOK IN THE INTEREST OF SCIENCE I WILL CIPHER IT OUT ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT IT IS MASCULINE VERY WELL THEN THE RAIN
252-128411-0015 IN A KIND OF A GENERAL WAY ON THE GROUND IT IS THEN DEFINITELY LOCATED IT IS DOING SOMETHING THAT IS RESTING WHICH IS ONE OF THE GERMAN GRAMMAR'S IDEAS
252-128411-0016 THIS RAIN IS NOT RESTING BUT IS DOING SOMETHING ACTIVELY IT IS FALLING TO INTERFERE WITH THE BIRD LIKELY AND THIS INDICATES MOVEMENT
252-128411-0017 WHICH HAS THE EFFECT OF SLIDING IT INTO THE ACCUSATIVE CASE
252-128411-0018 THE GRAMMATICAL HOROSCOPE OF THIS MATTER I ANSWER UP CONFIDENTLY AND STATE IN GERMAN THAT THE BIRD IS STAYING IN THE BLACKSMITH SHOP
252-128411-0019 THE TEACHER LETS ME SOFTLY DOWN WITH THE REMARK THAT WHENEVER THE WORD
252-128411-0020 DROPS INTO A SENTENCE IT ALWAYS THROWS THAT SUBJECT INTO THE GENITIVE CASE REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES AND THEREFORE THIS BIRD STAYED IN THE BLACKSMITH SHOP
252-128411-0021 N B I WAS INFORMED LATER BY A HIGHER AUTHORITY THAT THERE WAS AN EXCEPTION WHICH PERMITS ONE TO SAY
252-128411-0022 BUT THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS NOT EXTENDED TO ANYTHING BUT RAIN THERE ARE TEN PARTS OF SPEECH AND THEY ARE ALL TROUBLESOME AN AVERAGE SENTENCE IN A GERMAN NEWSPAPER
252-128411-0023 MAINLY OF COMPOUND WORDS CONSTRUCTED BY THE WRITER ON THE SPOT AND NOT TO BE FOUND IN ANY DICTIONARY SIX OR SEVEN WORDS COMPACTED INTO ONE WITHOUT JOINT OR SEAM THAT IS
252-128411-0024 WITHOUT HYPHENS IT TREATS OF FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN DIFFERENT SUBJECTS EACH ENCLOSED IN A PARENTHESIS OF ITS OWN WITH HERE AND THERE EXTRA PARENTHESES
252-128411-0025 MAKING PENS WITHIN PENS FINALLY ALL THE PARENTHESES
252-128411-0026 ARE MASSED TOGETHER BETWEEN A COUPLE OF KING PARENTHESES ONE OF WHICH IS PLACED IN THE FIRST LINE OF THE MAJESTIC SENTENCE AND THE OTHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST LINE OF IT
252-128411-0027 OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT AND THE MONUMENT IS FINISHED I SUPPOSE
252-128411-0028 NOT NECESSARY BUT PRETTY GERMAN BOOKS ARE EASY ENOUGH TO READ WHEN YOU HOLD THEM BEFORE THE LOOKING GLASS OR STAND ON YOUR HEAD SO AS TO REVERSE THE CONSTRUCTION BUT I THINK
252-128411-0029 THAT TO LEARN TO READ AND UNDERSTAND A GERMAN NEWSPAPER IS A THING WHICH MUST ALWAYS REMAIN AN IMPOSSIBILITY TO A FOREIGNER YET EVEN THE GERMAN BOOKS ARE NOT ENTIRELY FREE
252-128411-0030 THOUGH THEY ARE USUALLY SO MILD AS TO COVER ONLY A FEW LINES AND THEREFORE WHEN YOU AT LAST GET DOWN TO THE VERB IT CARRIES SOME MEANING TO YOUR MIND
252-128411-0031 BECAUSE YOU ARE ABLE TO REMEMBER A GOOD DEAL OF WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE NOW HERE IS A SENTENCE
252-128411-0032 WITH A SLIGHT PARENTHESIS IN IT I WILL MAKE A PERFECTLY LITERAL TRANSLATION AND THROW IN THE PARENTHESIS MARKS AND SOME HYPHENS FOR THE ASSISTANCE OF THE READER THOUGH IN THE ORIGINAL
252-128411-0033 THERE ARE NO PARENTHESIS MARKS OR HYPHENS AND THE READER IS LEFT TO FLOUNDER THROUGH TO THE REMOTE VERB THE BEST WAY HE CAN BUT WHEN HE UPON THE STREET THE
252-128411-0034 IN SATIN AND SILK COVERED NOW VERY UNCONSTRAINED AFTER THE NEWEST FASHIONED DRESSED
252-128411-0035 THAT IS FROM THE OLD MAMSELLE'S SECRET BY MISSUS MARLITT AND THAT SENTENCE IS CONSTRUCTED UPON THE MOST APPROVED GERMAN MODEL YOU OBSERVE
252-128411-0036 HOW FAR THAT VERB IS FROM THE READER'S BASE OF OPERATIONS WELL IN A GERMAN NEWSPAPER THEY PUT THEIR VERB AWAY OVER ON THE NEXT PAGE AND I HAVE HEARD THAT SOMETIMES
252-128411-0037 THEY GET IN A HURRY AND HAVE TO GO TO PRESS WITHOUT GETTING TO THE VERB AT ALL OF COURSE THEN THE READER IS LEFT IN A VERY EXHAUSTED AND IGNORANT STATE WE HAVE THE PARENTHESIS DISEASE
252-128411-0038 IN OUR LITERATURE TOO AND ONE MAY SEE CASES OF IT EVERY DAY IN OUR BOOKS AND NEWSPAPERS BUT WITH US IT IS THE MARK AND SIGN OF AN UNPRACTICED WRITER OR A CLOUDY INTELLECT WHEREAS
252-128411-0039 WITH THE GERMANS IT IS DOUBTLESS THE MARK AND SIGN OF A PRACTICED PEN AND OF THE PRESENCE OF THAT SORT OF LUMINOUS INTELLECTUAL FOG WHICH STANDS FOR CLEARNESS AMONG THESE PEOPLE FOR SURELY IT IS NOT
252-128411-0040 IT NECESSARILY CAN'T BE CLEARNESS EVEN A JURY WOULD HAVE PENETRATION ENOUGH TO DISCOVER THAT A WRITER'S IDEAS MUST BE A GOOD DEAL CONFUSED A GOOD DEAL OUT OF LINE AND SEQUENCE
252-128411-0041 WHEN HE STARTS OUT TO SAY THAT A MAN MET A COUNSELOR'S WIFE IN THE STREET AND THEN RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THIS SO SIMPLE UNDERTAKING HALTS THESE APPROACHING PEOPLE AND MAKES THEM STAND STILL
252-128411-0042 UNTIL HE JOTS DOWN AN INVENTORY OF THE WOMAN'S DRESS THAT IS MANIFESTLY ABSURD IT REMINDS A PERSON OF THOSE DENTISTS WHO SECURE YOUR INSTANT AND BREATHLESS INTEREST IN A TOOTH
252-128411-0043 WITH THE FORCEPS AND THEN STAND THERE AND DRAWL THROUGH A TEDIOUS ANECDOTE BEFORE THEY GIVE THE DREADED JERK
252-128411-0044 AND DENTISTRY ARE IN BAD TASTE THE GERMANS
252-128411-0045 CONCEIVE OF ANYTHING MORE CONFUSING THAN THAT THESE THINGS ARE CALLED SEPARABLE VERBS THE GERMAN GRAMMAR IS BLISTERED ALL OVER WITH SEPARABLE VERBS AND THE WIDER
252-128411-0046 WHO DRESSED IN SIMPLE WHITE MUSLIN WITH A SINGLE TUBEROSE IN THE AMPLE FOLDS OF HER RICH BROWN HAIR HAD TOTTERED FEEBLY DOWN THE STAIRS STILL PALE FROM THE TERROR AND EXCITEMENT OF THE PAST EVENING
252-128411-0047 BUT LONGING TO LAY HER POOR ACHING HEAD YET ONCE AGAIN UPON THE BREAST OF HIM WHOM SHE LOVED MORE DEARLY THAN LIFE ITSELF PARTED HOWEVER IT IS NOT WELL
252-128411-0048 TO DWELL TOO MUCH ON THE SEPARABLE VERBS ONE IS SURE TO LOSE HIS TEMPER EARLY AND IF HE STICKS TO THE SUBJECT AND WILL NOT BE WARNED IT WILL AT LAST EITHER SOFTEN HIS BRAIN
252-128411-0049 OR PETRIFY IT PERSONAL PRONOUNS AND ADJECTIVES ARE A FRUITFUL NUISANCE IN THIS LANGUAGE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT FOR INSTANCE THE SAME SOUND
252-128411-0050 SIE MEANS YOU AND IT MEANS SHE AND IT MEANS HER AND IT MEANS IT AND IT MEANS THEY AND IT MEANS THEM
252-128411-0051 THINK OF THE RAGGED POVERTY OF A LANGUAGE WHICH HAS TO MAKE ONE WORD DO THE WORK OF SIX AND A POOR LITTLE WEAK THING OF ONLY THREE LETTERS AT THAT BUT MAINLY
252-128411-0052 THINK OF THE EXASPERATION OF NEVER KNOWING WHICH OF THESE MEANINGS THE SPEAKER IS TRYING TO CONVEY THIS EXPLAINS WHY
252-128411-0053 SAYS SIE TO ME I GENERALLY TRY TO KILL HIM
