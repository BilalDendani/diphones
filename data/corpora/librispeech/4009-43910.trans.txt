4009-43910-0041 WHEN THEY ARE TOO BIG THEY ARE TOO SOFT AND IF SMALL THEY ARE TOO HARD SCRAPE THE STEMS WASH THEM CAREFULLY BUT DO NOT KEEP IN WATER FOR THEN THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR PLEASANT ODOR THEN CUT THEM IN RATHER LARGE SLICES AND DIP THEM IN FLOUR BEFORE PUTTING IN THE FRYING PAN

4009-43910-0046 AND FOR THIS REASON IT IS WELL TO HAVE SOME ALWAYS AT HAND SINCE HOWEVER IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO HAVE THEM FRESH THE FOLLOWING RECIPE TO PREPARE DRIED MUSHROOMS WILL BE FOUND USEFUL FIRST OF ALL WAIT UNTIL THERE IS A SUNNY DAY
4009-43910-0047 CHOOSE YOUNG MUSHROOMS MIDDLE SIZED OR BIG BUT NOT TOO SOFT SCRAPE THE STEM CLEAN THEM WELL IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE EARTH AND WITHOUT WASHING CUT THEM IN BIG PIECES THIS BECAUSE WHEN DRIED THEY DIMINISH CONSIDERABLY IN SIZE
4009-43910-0048 KEEP THESE PIECES EXPOSED IN THE SUN FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS THEN THREAD THEM ON A STRING PRACTISING A HOLE IN THEM AND KEEP IN A WELL VENTILATED ROOM OR IN THE SUN UNTIL THEY BECOME QUITE DRY
4009-43910-0049 THEN PUT THEM AWAY WELL CLOSED IN A PAPER BAG BUT DON'T FAIL TO LOOK AT THEM FROM TIME TO TIME TO SEE IF IT IS NECESSARY TO EXPOSE THEM SOME MORE TO SUN AND VENTILATION
