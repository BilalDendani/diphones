4358-44937-0000 THE FIRST BUILDING ERECTED FOR HULL HOUSE CONTAINED AN ART GALLERY WELL LIGHTED FOR DAY AND EVENING USE AND OUR FIRST EXHIBIT OF LOANED PICTURES WAS OPENED IN JUNE EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE BY MISTER AND MISSUS BARNETT OF LONDON
4358-44937-0001 IT IS ALWAYS PLEASANT TO ASSOCIATE THEIR HEARTY SYMPATHY WITH THAT FIRST EXHIBIT AND THUS TO CONNECT IT WITH THEIR PIONEER EFFORTS AT TOYNBEE HALL TO SECURE FOR WORKING PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW THE BEST ART
4358-44937-0002 AND WITH THEIR ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIRST PERMANENT ART GALLERY IN AN INDUSTRIAL QUARTER WE TOOK PRIDE IN THE FACT THAT OUR FIRST EXHIBIT CONTAINED SOME OF THE BEST PICTURES CHICAGO AFFORDED
4358-44937-0003 AND WE CONSCIENTIOUSLY INSURED THEM AGAINST FIRE AND CAREFULLY GUARDED THEM BY NIGHT AND DAY WE HAD FIVE OF THESE EXHIBITS DURING TWO YEARS AFTER THE GALLERY WAS COMPLETED TWO OF OIL PAINTINGS ONE OF OLD ENGRAVINGS AND ETCHINGS
4358-44937-0004 ONE OF WATER COLORS AND ONE OF PICTURES ESPECIALLY SELECTED FOR USE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS THESE EXHIBITS WERE SURPRISINGLY WELL ATTENDED AND THOUSANDS OF VOTES WERE CAST FOR THE MOST POPULAR PICTURES
4358-44937-0005 THEIR VALUE TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF COURSE HAD TO BE DETERMINED BY EACH ONE OF US ACCORDING TO THE VALUE HE ATTACHED TO BEAUTY AND THE ESCAPE IT OFFERS FROM DREARY REALITY INTO THE REALM OF THE IMAGINATION
4358-44937-0006 MISS STARR ALWAYS INSISTED THAT THE ARTS SHOULD RECEIVE ADEQUATE RECOGNITION AT HULL HOUSE AND URGED THAT ONE MUST ALWAYS REMEMBER THE HUNGRY INDIVIDUAL SOUL WHICH WITHOUT ART WILL HAVE PASSED UNSOLACED AND UNFED
4358-44937-0007 FOLLOWED BY OTHER SOULS WHO LACK THE IMPULSE HIS SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THE EXHIBITS AFFORDED PATHETIC EVIDENCE THAT THE OLDER IMMIGRANTS DO NOT EXPECT THE SOLACE OF ART IN THIS COUNTRY AN ITALIAN EXPRESSED GREAT SURPRISE WHEN HE FOUND THAT WE
4358-44937-0008 ALTHOUGH AMERICANS STILL LIKED PICTURES AND SAID QUITE NAIVELY THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT AMERICANS CARED FOR ANYTHING BUT DOLLARS THAT LOOKING AT PICTURES WAS SOMETHING PEOPLE ONLY DID IN ITALY
4358-44937-0009 THE EXTREME ISOLATION OF THE ITALIAN COLONY WAS DEMONSTRATED BY THE FACT THAT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THERE WAS A PUBLIC ART GALLERY IN THE CITY NOR ANY HOUSES IN WHICH PICTURES WERE REGARDED AS TREASURES
4358-44937-0010 A GREEK WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO SEE A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE ACROPOLIS AT HULL HOUSE BECAUSE HE HAD LIVED IN CHICAGO FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AND HAD NEVER BEFORE MET ANY AMERICANS WHO KNEW ABOUT THIS FOREMOST GLORY OF THE WORLD BEFORE HE LEFT GREECE
4358-44937-0011 BUT ALTHOUGH FROM HIS FRUIT STAND NEAR ONE OF THE LARGE RAILROAD STATIONS HE HAD CONVERSED WITH MANY AMERICANS AND HAD OFTEN TRIED TO LEAD THE CONVERSATION BACK TO ANCIENT GREECE NO ONE HAD RESPONDED AND HE HAD AT LAST CONCLUDED THAT
4358-44937-0012 IN TIME EVEN THESE PARTIES WERE DISCONTINUED AS THE GALLERIES BECAME BETTER KNOWN IN ALL PARTS OF THE CITY AND THE ART INSTITUTE MANAGEMENT DID MUCH TO MAKE PICTURES POPULAR
4358-44937-0013 FROM THE FIRST A STUDIO WAS MAINTAINED AT HULL HOUSE WHICH HAS DEVELOPED THROUGH THE CHANGING YEARS UNDER THE DIRECTION OF MISS BENEDICT ONE OF THE RESIDENTS WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE FACULTY IN THE ART INSTITUTE
4358-44937-0014 BUILDINGS ON THE HULL HOUSE QUADRANGLE FURNISH STUDIOS FOR ARTISTS WHO FIND SOMETHING OF THE SAME SPIRIT IN THE CONTIGUOUS ITALIAN COLONY THAT THE FRENCH ARTIST IS TRADITIONALLY SUPPOSED TO DISCOVER IN HIS BELOVED LATIN QUARTER
4358-44937-0015 THESE ARTISTS UNCOVER SOMETHING OF THE PICTURESQUE IN THE FOREIGN COLONIES WHICH THEY HAVE REPRODUCED IN PAINTING ETCHING AND LITHOGRAPHY THEY FIND THEIR CLASSES FILLED NOT ONLY BY YOUNG PEOPLE POSSESSING FACILITY AND SOMETIMES TALENT
4358-44937-0016 BUT ALSO BY OLDER PEOPLE TO WHOM THE STUDIO AFFORDS THE ONE OPPORTUNITY OF ESCAPE FROM DREARINESS A WIDOW WITH FOUR CHILDREN WHO SUPPLEMENTED A VERY INADEQUATE INCOME BY TEACHING THE PIANO
4358-44937-0017 FOR SIX YEARS NEVER MISSED HER WEEKLY PAINTING LESSON BECAUSE IT WAS HER ONE PLEASURE ANOTHER WOMAN WHOSE YOUTH AND STRENGTH HAD GONE INTO THE CARE OF AN INVALID FATHER POURED INTO HER AFTERNOON IN THE STUDIO ONCE A WEEK
4358-44937-0018 HAVE BEEN USED IN MANY AN EXPERIMENT AS HAS A SET OF BEAUTIFUL TYPE LOANED TO HULL HOUSE BY A BIBLIOPHILE THE WORK OF THE STUDIO ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY MERGED INTO THE CRAFTS AND WELL WITHIN THE FIRST DECADE A SHOP WAS OPENED AT HULL HOUSE
4358-44937-0019 THIS SHOP IS NOT MERELY A SCHOOL WHERE PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT AND THEN SENT FORTH TO USE THEIR TEACHING IN ART ACCORDING TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE AND OPPORTUNITY BUT WHERE THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN CAREFULLY TRAINED MAY EXPRESS THE BEST THEY CAN IN WOOD OR METAL
4358-44937-0020 THE SETTLEMENT SOON DISCOVERS HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO PUT A FRINGE OF ART ON THE END OF A DAY SPENT IN A FACTORY WE CONSTANTLY SEE YOUNG PEOPLE DOING OVERHURRIED WORK
4358-44937-0021 WRAPPING BARS OF SOAP IN PIECES OF PAPER MIGHT AT LEAST GIVE THE PLEASURE OF ACCURACY AND REPETITION IF IT COULD BE DONE AT A NORMAL PACE BUT WHEN PAID FOR BY THE PIECE
4358-44937-0022 SPEED BECOMES THE SOLE REQUIREMENT AND THE LAST SUGGESTION OF HUMAN INTEREST IS TAKEN AWAY IN CONTRAST TO THIS THE HULL HOUSE SHOP AFFORDS MANY EXAMPLES OF THE RESTORATIVE POWER IN THE EXERCISE OF A GENUINE CRAFT
4358-44937-0023 A YOUNG RUSSIAN WHO LIKE TOO MANY OF HIS COUNTRYMEN HAD MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT TO FIT HIMSELF FOR A LEARNED PROFESSION AND WHO HAD ALMOST FINISHED HIS COURSE IN A NIGHT LAW SCHOOL USED TO WATCH CONSTANTLY THE WORK BEING DONE IN THE METAL SHOP AT HULL HOUSE
4358-44937-0024 ONE EVENING IN A MOMENT OF SUDDEN RESOLVE HE TOOK OFF HIS COAT SAT DOWN AT ONE OF THE BENCHES AND BEGAN TO WORK OBVIOUSLY AS A VERY CLEVER SILVERSMITH HE HAD LONG CONCEALED HIS CRAFT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WOULD HURT HIS EFFORTS AS A LAWYER
4358-44937-0025 AND BECAUSE HE IMAGINED AN OFFICE MORE HONORABLE AND MORE AMERICAN THAN A SHOP AS HE WORKED ON DURING HIS TWO LEISURE EVENINGS EACH WEEK HIS ENTIRE BEARING AND CONVERSATION REGISTERED THE RELIEF OF ONE WHO ABANDONS THE EFFORT HE IS NOT FITTED FOR
4358-44937-0026 AND BECOMES A MAN ON HIS OWN FEET EXPRESSING HIMSELF THROUGH A FAMILIAR AND DELICATE TECHNIQUE MISS STARR AT LENGTH FOUND HERSELF QUITE IMPATIENT WITH HER ROLE OF LECTURER ON THE ARTS
4358-44937-0027 BEAUTY AND THOROUGHNESS ARE TAUGHT TO A SMALL NUMBER OF APPRENTICES FROM THE VERY FIRST WINTER CONCERTS WHICH ARE STILL CONTINUED WERE GIVEN EVERY SUNDAY AFTERNOON IN THE HULL HOUSE DRAWING ROOM AND LATER AS THE AUDIENCES INCREASED IN THE LARGER HALLS
4358-44937-0028 FOR THESE WE ARE INDEBTED TO MUSICIANS FROM EVERY PART OF THE CITY MISTER WILLIAM TOMLINS EARLY TRAINED LARGE CHORUSES OF ADULTS AS HIS ASSISTANTS DID OF CHILDREN
4358-44937-0029 AND THE RESPONSE TO ALL OF THESE SHOWED THAT WHILE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN OUR VICINITY CARING FOR THE BEST MUSIC WAS NOT LARGE THEY CONSTITUTED A STEADY AND APPRECIATIVE GROUP
4358-44937-0030 IT WAS IN CONNECTION WITH THESE FIRST CHORUSES THAT A PUBLIC SPIRITED CITIZEN OF CHICAGO OFFERED A PRIZE FOR THE BEST LABOR SONG COMPETITION TO BE OPEN TO THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THE RESPONSES TO THE OFFER LITERALLY FILLED THREE LARGE BARRELS
4358-44937-0031 AND SPEAKING AT LEAST FOR MYSELF AS ONE OF THE BEWILDERED JUDGES WE WERE MORE DISHEARTENED BY THEIR QUALITY THAN EVEN BY THEIR OVERWHELMING BULK APPARENTLY THE WORKERS OF AMERICA ARE NOT YET READY TO SING
4358-44937-0032 ALTHOUGH I RECALL A CREDITABLE CHORUS TRAINED AT HULL HOUSE FOR A LARGE MEETING IN SYMPATHY WITH THE ANTHRACITE COAL STRIKE IN WHICH THE SWINGING LINES WHO WAS IT MADE THE COAL OUR GOD AS WELL AS THEIRS
4358-44937-0033 SEEMED TO RELIEVE THE TENSION OF THE MOMENT MISS ELEANOR SMITH THE HEAD OF THE HULL HOUSE MUSIC SCHOOL WHO HAD PUT THE WORDS TO MUSIC PERFORMED THE SAME OFFICE FOR THE SWEATSHOP OF THE YIDDISH POET
4358-44937-0034 THE TRANSLATION OF WHICH PRESENTS SO GRAPHICALLY THE BEWILDERMENT AND TEDIUM OF THE NEW YORK SHOP THAT IT MIGHT BE APPLIED TO ALMOST ANY OTHER MACHINERY INDUSTRY AS THE FIRST VERSE INDICATES THE ROARING OF THE WHEELS HAS FILLED MY EARS
4358-44937-0035 THE CLASHING AND THE CLAMOR SHUT ME IN MYSELF MY SOUL IN CHAOS DISAPPEARS I CANNOT THINK OR FEEL AMID THE DIN
4358-44937-0036 IT MAY BE THAT THIS PLAINT EXPLAINS THE LACK OF LABOR SONGS IN THIS PERIOD OF INDUSTRIAL MALADJUSTMENT WHEN THE WORKER IS OVERMASTERED BY HIS VERY TOOLS IN ADDITION TO SHARING WITH OUR NEIGHBORHOOD THE BEST MUSIC WE COULD PROCURE
4358-44937-0037 WE HAVE CONSCIENTIOUSLY PROVIDED CAREFUL MUSICAL INSTRUCTION THAT AT LEAST A FEW YOUNG PEOPLE MIGHT UNDERSTAND THOSE OLD USAGES OF ART THAT THEY MIGHT MASTER ITS TRADE SECRETS FOR AFTER ALL IT IS ONLY THROUGH A CAREFUL TECHNIQUE
4358-44937-0038 THAT ARTISTIC ABILITY CAN EXPRESS ITSELF AND BE PRESERVED FROM THE BEGINNING WE HAD CLASSES IN MUSIC AND THE HULL HOUSE MUSIC SCHOOL WHICH IS HOUSED IN QUARTERS OF ITS OWN IN OUR QUIETER COURT WAS OPENED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE
4358-44937-0039 THE SCHOOL IS DESIGNED TO GIVE A THOROUGH MUSICAL INSTRUCTION TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF CHILDREN FROM THE FIRST LESSONS THEY ARE TAUGHT TO COMPOSE AND TO REDUCE TO ORDER THE MUSICAL SUGGESTIONS WHICH MAY COME TO THEM
4358-44937-0040 AND IN THIS WISE THE SCHOOL HAS SOMETIMES BEEN ABLE TO RECOVER THE SONGS OF THE IMMIGRANTS THROUGH THEIR CHILDREN SOME OF THESE FOLK SONGS HAVE NEVER BEEN COMMITTED TO PAPER
4358-44937-0041 BUT HAVE SURVIVED THROUGH THE CENTURIES BECAUSE OF A TOUCH OF UNDYING POETRY WHICH THE WORLD HAS ALWAYS CHERISHED AS IN THE SONG OF A RUSSIAN WHO IS DIGGING A POST HOLE AND FINDS HIS TASK DULL AND DIFFICULT UNTIL HE STRIKES A STRATUM OF RED SAND
4358-44937-0042 MANY CASES INDISPUTABLY ILLUSTRATE THIS A BOHEMIAN GIRL WHO IN ORDER TO EARN MONEY FOR PRESSING FAMILY NEEDS FIRST RUINED HER VOICE IN A SIX MONTHS CONSTANT VAUDEVILLE ENGAGEMENT RETURNED TO HER TRADE WORKING OVERTIME
4358-44937-0043 IN A VAIN EFFORT TO CONTINUE THE VAUDEVILLE INCOME ANOTHER YOUNG GIRL WHOM HULL HOUSE HAD SENT TO THE HIGH SCHOOL SO LONG AS HER PARENTS CONSENTED BECAUSE WE REALIZED THAT A BEAUTIFUL VOICE IS OFTEN UNAVAILABLE THROUGH LACK OF THE INFORMING MIND
4358-44937-0044 LATER EXTINGUISHED HER PROMISE IN A TOBACCO FACTORY A THIRD GIRL WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER LITTLE SISTERS SINCE SHE WAS FOURTEEN EAGERLY USED HER FINE VOICE FOR EARNING MONEY AT ENTERTAINMENTS HELD LATE AFTER HER DAY'S WORK UNTIL EXPOSURE
4358-44937-0045 AND FATIGUE RUINED HER HEALTH AS WELL AS A MUSICIAN'S FUTURE A YOUNG MAN WHOSE MUSIC LOVING FAMILY GAVE HIM EVERY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY
4358-44937-0046 IN THE LITTLE SERVICE HELD AT HULL HOUSE IN HIS MEMORY WHEN THE CHILDREN SANG HIS COMPOSITION HOW SWEET IS THE SHEPHERD'S SWEET LOT IT WAS HARD TO REALIZE THAT SUCH AN INTERPRETIVE PASTORAL COULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY ONE WHOSE CHILDHOOD
4358-44937-0047 IT REQUIRED BUT LITTLE PENETRATION TO SEE THAT DURING THE EIGHT YEARS THE CLASS OF FIFTEEN SCHOOL CHILDREN HAD COME TOGETHER TO THE MUSIC SCHOOL THEY HAD APPROXIMATELY AN EVEN CHANCE
4358-44937-0048 COULD ENDURE THE STRAIN OF LONG HOURS AND BAD AIR THUS THE AVERAGE HUMAN YOUTH WITH ALL THE SWEETNESS OF THE COMMON DAWN IS FLUNG INTO THE VORTEX OF INDUSTRIAL LIFE WHEREIN THE EVERYDAY TRAGEDY ESCAPES US
4358-44937-0049 SAVE WHEN ONE OF THEM BECOMES CONSPICUOUSLY UNFORTUNATE TWICE IN ONE YEAR WE WERE COMPELLED TO FIND THE INHERITANCE OF THIS POOR CHILD HIS LITTLE KINGDOM OF A FORCED GRAVE
4358-44937-0050 IT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT MANY TIMES THAT ART LIVES BY DEVOURING HER OWN OFFSPRING AND THE WORLD HAS COME TO JUSTIFY EVEN THAT SACRIFICE
4358-44937-0051 BUT WE ARE UNFORTIFIED AND UNSOLACED WHEN WE SEE THE CHILDREN OF ART DEVOURED NOT BY HER BUT BY THE UNCOUTH STRANGER MODERN INDUSTRY WHO NEEDLESSLY RUTHLESS AND BRUTAL TO HER OWN CHILDREN
4358-44937-0052 IS QUICKLY FATAL TO THE OFFSPRING OF THE GENTLER MOTHER AND SO SCHOOLS IN ART FOR THOSE WHO GO TO WORK AT THE AGE WHEN MORE FORTUNATE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE STILL SHELTERED AND EDUCATED CONSTANTLY EPITOMIZE ONE OF THE HAUNTING PROBLEMS OF LIFE
4358-44937-0053 WHY DO WE PERMIT THE WASTE OF THIS MOST PRECIOUS HUMAN FACULTY THIS CONSUMMATE POSSESSION OF CIVILIZATION WHEN WE FAIL TO PROVIDE THE VESSEL IN WHICH IT MAY BE TREASURED
4358-44937-0054 IT RUNS OUT UPON THE GROUND AND IS IRRETRIEVABLY LOST THE UNIVERSAL DESIRE FOR THE PORTRAYAL OF LIFE LYING QUITE OUTSIDE OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE EVINCES ITSELF IN MANY FORMS ONE OF THE CONSPICUOUS FEATURES OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD
4358-44937-0055 AS OF ALL INDUSTRIAL QUARTERS IS THE PERSISTENCY WITH WHICH THE ENTIRE POPULATION ATTENDS THE THEATER THE VERY FIRST DAY I SAW HALSTED STREET A LONG LINE OF YOUNG MEN AND BOYS STOOD OUTSIDE THE GALLERY ENTRANCE OF THE BIJOU THEATER
4358-44937-0056 WAITING FOR THE SUNDAY MATINEE TO BEGIN AT TWO O'CLOCK ALTHOUGH IT WAS ONLY HIGH NOON THIS WAITING CROWD MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN EVERY SUNDAY AFTERNOON DURING THE TWENTY YEARS WHICH HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THEN OUR FIRST SUNDAY EVENING IN HULL HOUSE
4358-44937-0057 WHEN A GROUP OF SMALL BOYS SAT ON OUR PIAZZA AND TOLD US ABOUT THINGS AROUND HERE THEIR TALK WAS ALL OF THE THEATER AND OF THE ASTONISHING THINGS THEY HAD SEEN THAT AFTERNOON
4358-44937-0058 BUT QUITE AS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER THE HABITS AND PURPOSES OF THIS GROUP OF BOYS BECAUSE THEY MUCH PREFERRED TALKING ABOUT THE THEATER TO CONTEMPLATING THEIR OWN LIVES SO IT WAS ALL ALONG THE LINE
4358-44937-0059 THE YOUNG MEN TOLD US THEIR AMBITIONS IN THE PHRASES OF STAGE HEROES AND THE GIRLS SO FAR AS THEIR ROMANTIC DREAMS COULD BE SHYLY PUT INTO WORDS POSSESSED NO OTHERS BUT THOSE SOILED BY LONG USE IN THE MELODRAMA
4358-44937-0060 ALL OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE LOOKED UPON AN AFTERNOON A WEEK IN THE GALLERY OF A HALSTED STREET THEATER AS THEIR ONE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE LIFE THE SORT OF MELODRAMA THEY SEE THERE HAS RECENTLY BEEN DESCRIBED AS
4358-44937-0061 THE TEN COMMANDMENTS WRITTEN IN RED FIRE CERTAINLY THE VILLAIN ALWAYS COMES TO A VIOLENT END AND THE YOUNG AND HANDSOME HERO IS REWARDED BY MARRIAGE WITH A BEAUTIFUL GIRL USUALLY THE DAUGHTER OF A MILLIONAIRE
4358-44937-0062 BUT AFTER ALL THAT IS NOT A PORTRAYAL OF THE MORALITY OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS ANY MORE THAN OF LIFE ITSELF NEVERTHELESS THE THEATER SUCH AS IT WAS
4358-44937-0063 APPEARED TO BE THE ONE AGENCY WHICH FREED THE BOYS AND GIRLS FROM THAT DESTRUCTIVE ISOLATION OF THOSE WHO DRAG THEMSELVES UP TO MATURITY BY THEMSELVES AND IT GAVE THEM A GLIMPSE OF THAT ORDER AND BEAUTY INTO WHICH EVEN THE POOREST DRAMA
4358-44937-0064 ENDEAVORS TO RESTORE THE BEWILDERING FACTS OF LIFE THE MOST PROSAIC YOUNG PEOPLE BEAR TESTIMONY TO THIS OVERMASTERING DESIRE
4358-44937-0065 A STRIKING ILLUSTRATION OF THIS CAME TO US DURING OUR SECOND YEAR'S RESIDENCE ON HALSTED STREET THROUGH AN INCIDENT IN THE ITALIAN COLONY WHERE THE MEN HAVE ALWAYS BOASTED THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GUARD THEIR DAUGHTERS FROM THE DANGERS OF CITY LIFE
4358-44937-0066 AND UNTIL EVIL ITALIANS ENTERED THE BUSINESS OF THE WHITE SLAVE TRAFFIC THEIR BOAST WAS WELL FOUNDED THE FIRST ITALIAN GIRL TO GO ASTRAY KNOWN TO THE RESIDENTS OF HULL HOUSE
4358-44937-0067 WAS SO FASCINATED BY THE STAGE THAT ON HER WAY HOME FROM WORK SHE ALWAYS LOITERED OUTSIDE A THEATER BEFORE THE ENTICING POSTERS THREE MONTHS AFTER HER ELOPEMENT WITH AN ACTOR HER DISTRACTED MOTHER RECEIVED A PICTURE OF HER DRESSED IN THE MEN'S CLOTHES IN WHICH SHE APPEARED IN VAUDEVILLE
4358-44937-0068 HER FAMILY MOURNED HER AS DEAD AND HER NAME WAS NEVER MENTIONED AMONG THEM NOR IN THE ENTIRE COLONY IN FURTHER ILLUSTRATION OF AN OVERMASTERING DESIRE TO SEE LIFE AS PORTRAYED ON THE STAGE ARE TWO YOUNG GIRLS WHOSE SOBER PARENTS DID NOT APPROVE OF THE THEATER
4358-44937-0069 AND WOULD ALLOW NO MONEY FOR SUCH FOOLISH PURPOSES IN SHEER DESPERATION THE SISTERS EVOLVED A PLOT THAT ONE OF THEM WOULD FEIGN A TOOTHACHE AND WHILE SHE WAS HAVING HER TOOTH PULLED BY A NEIGHBORING DENTIST THE OTHER WOULD STEAL THE GOLD CROWNS FROM HIS TABLE
4358-44937-0070 AND WITH THE MONEY THUS PROCURED THEY COULD ATTEND THE VAUDEVILLE THEATER EVERY NIGHT ON THEIR WAY HOME FROM WORK APPARENTLY THE PAIN AND WRONGDOING DID NOT WEIGH FOR A MOMENT AGAINST THE ANTICIPATED PLEASURE
4358-44937-0071 THE PLAN WAS CARRIED OUT TO THE POINT OF SELLING THE GOLD CROWNS TO A PAWNBROKER WHEN THE DISAPPOINTED GIRLS WERE ARRESTED ALL THIS EFFORT TO SEE THE PLAY TOOK PLACE IN THE YEARS BEFORE THE FIVE CENT THEATERS HAD BECOME A FEATURE OF EVERY CROWDED CITY THOROUGHFARE
4358-44937-0072 THE EAGERNESS OF THE PENNILESS CHILDREN TO GET INTO THESE MAGIC SPACES IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AN ENTIRE CROP OF PETTY CRIMES MADE MORE EASY BECAUSE TWO CHILDREN ARE ADMITTED FOR ONE NICKEL AT THE LAST PERFORMANCE WHEN THE HOUR IS LATE
4358-44937-0073 AND THE THEATER NEARLY DESERTED THE HULL HOUSE RESIDENTS WERE AGHAST AT THE EARLY POPULARITY OF THESE MIMIC SHOWS AND IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE INSPECTION OF FILMS AND THE PRESENT REGULATIONS FOR THE FIVE CENT THEATERS WE ESTABLISHED AT HULL HOUSE A MOVING PICTURE SHOW
4358-44937-0074 THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS IN THIS DIRECTION BY THE JUVENILE PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATION HOWEVER LONG BEFORE THE FIVE CENT THEATER WAS EVEN HEARD OF WE HAD ACCUMULATED MUCH TESTIMONY AS TO THE POWER OF THE DRAMA AND WE WOULD HAVE BEEN DULL INDEED
4358-44937-0075 IF WE HAD NOT AVAILED OURSELVES OF THE USE OF THE PLAY AT HULL HOUSE NOT ONLY AS AN AGENT OF RECREATION AND EDUCATION BUT AS A VEHICLE OF SELF EXPRESSION FOR THE TEEMING YOUNG LIFE ALL ABOUT US
4358-44937-0076 LONG BEFORE THE HULL HOUSE THEATER WAS BUILT WE HAD MANY PLAYS FIRST IN THE DRAWING ROOM AND LATER IN THE GYMNASIUM THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S CLUBS NEVER TIRED OF REHEARSING AND PREPARING FOR THESE DRAMATIC OCCASIONS
4358-44937-0077 TO REDUCE TO DRAMATIC EFFECTS THE GREAT DAYS OF PATRIOTISM AND RELIGION AT ONE OF OUR EARLY CHRISTMAS CELEBRATIONS LONGFELLOW'S GOLDEN LEGEND WAS GIVEN THE ACTORS PORTRAYING IT WITH THE TOUCH OF THE MIRACLE PLAY SPIRIT WHICH IT REFLECTS
4358-44937-0078 I REMEMBER AN OLD BLIND MAN WHO TOOK THE PART OF A SHEPHERD SAID AT THE END OF THE LAST PERFORMANCE KIND HEART A NAME BY WHICH HE ALWAYS ADDRESSED ME IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING ALL MY LIFE TO HEAR SOME OF THESE THINGS SAID
4358-44937-0079 I AM GLAD WE HAD SO MANY PERFORMANCES FOR I THINK I CAN REMEMBER THEM TO THE END IT IS GETTING HARD FOR ME TO LISTEN TO READING BUT THE DIFFERENT VOICES AND ALL MADE THIS VERY PLAIN HAD HE NOT PERHAPS MADE A LEGITIMATE DEMAND UPON THE DRAMA
4358-44937-0080 THAT IT SHALL EXPRESS FOR US THAT WHICH WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FORMULATE FOR OURSELVES THAT IT SHALL WARM US WITH A SENSE OF COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE EXPERIENCES OF OTHERS DOES NOT EVERY GENUINE DRAMA PRESENT OUR RELATIONS TO EACH OTHER
4358-44937-0081 WHICH HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE RESTRAINING BOND OF ONE COUNTRY INTO THE LAND OF THE UNIVERSAL A LARGE COLONY OF GREEKS NEAR HULL HOUSE WHO OFTEN FEEL THAT THEIR HISTORY AND CLASSIC BACKGROUND ARE COMPLETELY IGNORED BY AMERICANS
4358-44937-0082 WELCOME AN OCCASION TO PRESENT GREEK PLAYS IN THE ANCIENT TEXT WITH EXPERT HELP IN THE DIFFICULTIES OF STAGING AND REHEARSING A CLASSIC PLAY THEY REPRODUCED THE AJAX OF SOPHOCLES UPON THE HULL HOUSE STAGE
4358-44937-0083 IT WAS A GENUINE TRIUMPH TO THE ACTORS WHO FELT THAT THEY WERE SHOWING FORTH THE GLORY OF GREECE TO IGNORANT AMERICANS
