8296-279865-0000 IN SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX ROBERT CAVALIER
8296-279865-0001 CAME TO CANADA AND SET OUT FROM HIS SEIGNEURIE NEAR THE RAPIDS OF MONTREAL TO FIND THE LONG SOUGHT ROAD TO CHINA INSTEAD OF DOING THAT HE DISCOVERED THE OHIO RIVER FIRST OF WHITE MEN
8296-279865-0002 HE VOYAGED ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND SAILED DOWN THE MISSISSIPPI TO ITS MOUTH
8296-279865-0003 AND BUILT FRONTIER POSTS IN THE WILDERNESS
8296-279865-0004 LOUISIANA IN HONOR OF KING
8296-279865-0005 SOON AFTERWARD THIS SEIGNEUR'S BROTHER
8296-279865-0006 FOUNDED NEW ORLEANS AND ATTRACTED MANY FRENCH PIONEERS THERE
8296-279865-0007 IN THE NORTH THEY PRESSED WESTWARD AND CAME IN SIGHT OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AT THAT TIME IT SEEMED AS IF FRANCE WAS TO OWN AT LEAST TWO THIRDS OF THE CONTINENT
8296-279865-0008 IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE AND
8296-279865-0009 YEARS LATER THE ENGLISH GENERAL WOLFE
8296-279865-0010 AND FRANCE'S CHANCE WAS OVER
8296-279865-0011 SOON AFTERWARD FRANCE TO OUTWIT ENGLAND GAVE SPAIN NEW ORLEANS AND HER CLAIM
8296-279865-0012 VALLEY WEST OF THE RIVER TO WHICH THE NAME LOUISIANA NOW CAME TO BE RESTRICTED
8296-279865-0013 COULD NOT KEEP HIS FINGERS FROM NORTH AMERICA HE PLANNED TO WIN BACK THE NEW FRANCE THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN AWAY
8296-279865-0014 HE MEANT TO COLONIZE AND FORTIFY THIS SPLENDID EMPIRE BUT BEFORE IT COULD BE DONE ENEMIES GATHERED AGAINST HIS EAGLES AT HOME AND TO SAVE HIS EUROPEAN THRONE HE HAD TO FORSAKE HIS WESTERN COLONY
8296-279865-0015 REPOSSESSING HERSELF OF SO MUCH TERRITORY HE SENT ROBERT R LIVINGSTON AND JAMES MONROE TO PARIS TO TRY TO BUY NEW ORLEANS AND THE COUNTRY KNOWN AS THE FLORIDAS
8296-279865-0016 JEFFERSON AND THE PEOPLE IN THE EASTERN UNITED STATES WERE DISMAYED AT THE PRICE PAID FOR WHAT THEY CONSIDERED ALMOST WORTHLESS LAND BUT THE WEST WAS DELIGHTED OWNING THE MOUTH OF THE GREAT MISSISSIPPI AND WITH THE COUNTRY BEYOND IT FREE TO THEM TO EXPLORE
8296-279865-0017 IN TIME THIS PURCHASE OF LOUISIANA OR THE TERRITORY STRETCHING TO THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS FORMING THE LARGER PART OF WHAT ARE NOW THIRTEEN OF THE STATES OF THE UNION
8296-279865-0018 SCARCELY ANYTHING WAS KNOWN OF LOUISIANA EXCEPT THE STORIES TOLD BY A FEW HUNTERS JEFFERSON DECIDED THAT THE REGION MUST BE EXPLORED AND ASKED HIS YOUNG SECRETARY MERIWETHER LEWIS
8296-279865-0019 LEWIS CHOSE HIS FRIEND WILLIAM CLARK TO ACCOMPANY HIM AND PICKED THIRTY TWO EXPERIENCED MEN FOR THEIR PARTY MAY FOURTEENTH
8296-279865-0020 MISSOURI RIVER NEAR SAINT LOUIS THE NEARER PART OF THIS COUNTRY HAD ALREADY BEEN WELL EXPLORED BY HUNTERS AND TRAPPERS AND ESPECIALLY BY THAT RACE OF ADVENTUROUS FRENCHMEN WHO WERE ROVERS BY NATURE
8296-279865-0021 DRIVING THEIR LIGHT CANOES OVER THE WATERS OF THE GREAT RIVERS AND OFTEN SHARING THE TENTS OF FRIENDLY INDIANS THEY MET MANY HAD BECOME ALMOST MORE INDIAN THAN WHITE MAN HAD MARRIED INDIAN WIVES AND LIVED THE WANDERING LIFE OF THE NATIVE
8296-279865-0022 SUCH A MAN CAPTAIN LEWIS FOUND AT THE START OF HIS JOURNEY AND TOOK WITH HIM TO ACT
8296-279865-0023 MEETING SMALL BANDS OF INDIANS AND PASSING ONE OR TWO WIDELY SEPARATED FRONTIER SETTLEMENTS THEY HAD TO PASS MANY DIFFICULT RAPIDS IN THE RIVER BUT AS THEY WERE FOR THE MOST PART EXPERT BOATMEN THEY MET WITH NO MISHAPS
8296-279865-0024 CONSISTING OF SEVEN HOUSES WITH AS MANY FAMILIES LOCATED THERE
8296-279865-0025 AS THEY WENT UP THE RIVER THEY FREQUENTLY MET CANOES LOADED WITH FURS COMING DOWN DAY BY DAY THEY TOOK CAREFUL OBSERVATIONS AND MADE MAPS OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY WERE TRAVELING
8296-279865-0026 AND WHEN THEY MET INDIANS TRIED TO LEARN THE HISTORY AND CUSTOMS OF THE TRIBE CAPTAIN LEWIS WROTE DOWN MANY OF THEIR CURIOUS TRADITIONS
8296-279865-0027 NUMBERING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED WARRIORS THE LITTLE OSAGES WHO LIVED SOME SIX MILES DISTANT FROM THE OTHERS AND NUMBERED HALF AS MANY MEN
8296-279865-0028 THE OSAGES LIVED IN VILLAGES AND WERE GOOD FARMERS USUALLY PEACEFUL ALTHOUGH NATURALLY STRONG AND TIRELESS CAPTAIN LEWIS FOUND A CURIOUS TRADITION
8296-279865-0029 FOUNDER OF THE NATION WAS A SNAIL WHO LIVED QUIETLY ON THE BANKS OF THE OSAGE UNTIL A HIGH FLOOD SWEPT HIM DOWN TO THE MISSOURI AND LEFT HIM EXPOSED ON THE SHORE THE HEAT OF THE SUN AT LENGTH RIPENED HIM INTO A MAN
8296-279865-0030 BUT WITH THE CHANGE IN HIS NATURE HE DID NOT FORGET HIS NATIVE HAUNTS ON THE OSAGE BUT IMMEDIATELY BENT HIS WAY IN THAT DIRECTION HE WAS HOWEVER SOON OVERTAKEN BY HUNGER AND FATIGUE WHEN HAPPILY THE GREAT SPIRIT APPEARED
8296-279865-0031 AND GIVING HIM A BOW AND ARROW SHOWED HIM HOW TO KILL AND COOK DEER AND COVER HIMSELF WITH THE SKINS HE THEN PUSHED ON TO HIS HOME BUT AS HE NEARED IT HE WAS MET BY A BEAVER
8296-279865-0032 THE OSAGE READILY CONSENTED AND FROM THIS HAPPY MARRIAGE
8296-279865-0033 OF THE WASBASHA OR OSAGES WHO KEPT A REVERENCE FOR THEIR ANCESTORS NEVER HUNTING THE BEAVER BECAUSE IN KILLING THAT ANIMAL THEY WOULD KILL A BROTHER OF THE OSAGE
8296-279865-0034 THE EXPLORERS FOUND HOWEVER THAT SINCE THE VALUE OF BEAVER SKINS HAD RISEN IN TRADE WITH THE WHITE MEN THESE INDIANS WERE NOT SO PARTICULAR IN THEIR REVERENCE FOR THEIR RELATIVES
8296-279865-0035 ON JULY TWENTY FIRST
8296-279865-0036 AND NAMED THE SITE COUNCIL BLUFFS
8296-279865-0037 THE INDIANS WERE FRIENDLY AND EACH DAY TAUGHT THE WHITE MEN SOMETHING NEW
8296-279865-0038 THE WHIP RATTLES MADE OF THE HOOFS OF GOATS AND DEER
8296-279865-0039 EACH TRIBE DIFFERED IN SOME WAY FROM ITS NEIGHBORS FOR THE FIRST TIME THE EXPLORERS FOUND AMONG THE RICKAREES EIGHT SIDED EARTH COVERED LODGES AND BASKET SHAPED BOATS MADE OF INTERWOVEN BOUGHS COVERED WITH BUFFALO SKINS
8296-279865-0040 BESIDES THESE WERE ANTELOPES BEAVERS BEARS BADGERS DEER AND PORCUPINES AND THE RIVER BANKS SUPPLIED THEM WITH PLOVER GROUSE GEESE TURKEYS DUCKS AND PELICANS
8296-279865-0041 AND THEY LIVED WELL DURING THE WHOLE OF THE SUMMER
8296-279865-0042 EACH MEMBER OF THIS TRIBE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SELECT A PARTICULAR OBJECT FOR HIS DEVOTION AND CALL IT HIS MEDICINE
8296-279865-0043 I WAS LATELY THE OWNER OF SEVENTEEN HORSES BUT I HAVE OFFERED THEM ALL UP TO MY MEDICINE AND AM NOW POOR
8296-279865-0044 THEY WERE ABLE TO LEAVE THEIR CAMP AT FORT MANDEN AND START ON AGAIN THE UPPER MISSOURI THEY FOUND WAS TOO SHALLOW FOR THE LARGE BARGE THEY HAD USED THE PREVIOUS SUMMER
8296-279865-0045 WHILE THE OTHERS EMBARKED IN SIX CANOES AND TWO LARGE OPEN BOATS THAT THEY HAD BUILT DURING THE WINTER SO FAR
8296-279865-0046 BUT AS THEY NOW TURNED WESTWARD THEY CAME INTO A REGION ENTIRELY UNKNOWN
8296-279865-0047 THE PARTY HAD BY THIS TIME THREE INTERPRETERS
8296-279865-0048 THE INDIAN'S SKILL IN WOODCRAFT AND WHO ALSO KNEW THE LANGUAGE OF THE WHITE EXPLORERS
8296-279865-0049 THE BIRD WOMAN WHO HAD ORIGINALLY BELONGED TO THE SNAKE TRIBE BUT WHO HAD BEEN CAPTURED IN HER CHILDHOOD BY BLACKFEET INDIANS
8296-279865-0050 THEY WERE NOW VERY FAR NORTH NEAR THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF WHAT IS THE STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA GAME WAS STILL PLENTIFUL BUT THE BANKS OF THE RIVER WERE COVERED WITH A COATING OF ALKALI SALTS
8296-279865-0051 WHICH MADE THE WATER OF THE STREAMS BITTER AND UNPLEASANT FOR DRINKING OCCASIONALLY THEY CAME UPON A DESERTED INDIAN CAMP BUT IN THIS NORTHERN TERRITORY THEY FOUND FEW ROVING TRIBES WHEN THERE WAS A FAVORABLE WIND THEY SAILED ALONG THE MISSOURI
8296-279865-0052 WHERE THEY FOUND A LARGE NUMBER OF PORCUPINES FEEDING
8296-279865-0053 CAPTAIN LEWIS CHRISTENED THE STREAM PORCUPINE RIVER
8296-279865-0054 NOW THEY WERE CONTINUALLY COMING UPON NEW RIVERS MANY OF THEM BROAD WITH SWIFT FLOWING CURRENTS AND ALL OF THEM APPEALING TO THE LOVE OF EXPLORATION THE MISSOURI WAS THEIR HIGHROAD HOWEVER AND SO THEY SIMPLY STOPPED TO NAME THE DIFFERENT STREAMS THEY CAME TO
8296-279865-0055 THE COUNTRY ALONG THIS STREAM WAS BARE FOR SOME DISTANCE WITH GRADUALLY RISING HILLS BEYOND THE GAME HERE WAS VERY PLENTIFUL
8296-279865-0056 ONE EVENING THE MEN IN THE CANOES SAW A LARGE GRIZZLY LYING SOME THREE HUNDRED PACES FROM THE SHORE SIX OF THEM LANDED AND HID
8296-279865-0057 WITHIN FORTY PACES OF THE BEAR FOUR OF THE HUNTERS FIRED AND EACH LODGED A BALL IN THE BEAR'S BODY THE ANIMAL SPRANG UP AND ROARED FURIOUSLY AT THEM AS HE CAME NEAR THEM THE TWO HUNTERS WHO HAD NOT YET FIRED GAVE HIM TWO MORE WOUNDS
8296-279865-0058 ONE OF WHICH BROKE A SHOULDER BUT BEFORE THEY HAD TIME TO RELOAD THEIR GUNS THE BEAR WAS SO NEAR THEM THAT THEY HAD TO RUN FOR THE RIVER HE ALMOST OVERTOOK THEM TWO JUMPED INTO THE CANOES THE OTHER FOUR SEPARATED
8296-279865-0059 ONLY SEEMED TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION TOWARD THE HUNTERS UNTIL FINALLY HE CHASED TWO OF THEM SO CLOSELY THAT THEY THREW AWAY THEIR GUNS
8296-279865-0060 WHEN ONE OF THE OTHERS ON SHORE SHOT HIM IN THE HEAD AND FINALLY KILLED HIM THEY DRAGGED HIM TO SHORE AND FOUND THAT EIGHT BALLS HAD GONE THROUGH HIM IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THE HUNTERS TOOK THE BEAR'S SKIN BACK TO CAMP AND THERE THEY LEARNED THAT ANOTHER ADVENTURE HAD OCCURRED
8296-279865-0061 UPSET THE CANOE THE BOAT WOULD HAVE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN BUT FOR THE RESISTANCE OF THE CANVAS AWNING THE OTHER BOATS HASTENED TO THE RESCUE RIGHTED THE CANOE AND BY BALING HER OUT KEPT HER FROM SINKING THEY ROWED THE CANOE TO SHORE AND THE CARGO WAS SAVED
8296-279865-0062 AT A DISTANCE
8296-279865-0063 A SHORT DISTANCE BEYOND THIS CAPTAIN LEWIS
8296-279865-0064 ALONG THE MUSSELSHELL THE COUNTRY WAS COVERED WITH WILD ROSES AND SMALL HONEYSUCKLE
8296-279865-0065 THE MOSQUITOES ANNOYING THE NOONDAY SUN UNCOMFORTABLY HOT AND THE NIGHTS VERY COLD THE MISSOURI RIVER ALONG WHICH THEY WERE STILL TRAVELING WAS NOW HEADING TO THE SOUTHWEST
8296-279865-0066 MOST OF WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN DESERTED FOR FIVE OR SIX WEEKS FROM THIS FACT THEY JUDGED THAT THEY WERE FOLLOWING A BAND OF ABOUT
8296-279865-0067 THEY KNEW THAT THE MINNETAREES OF THE MISSOURI OFTEN
8296-279865-0068 FASTENING THE SKIN OF THE HEAD
8296-279865-0069 THUS DISGUISED THE INDIAN WOULD TAKE A POSITION BETWEEN A HERD OF BUFFALO AND THE PRECIPICE OVERLOOKING A RIVER THE OTHER HUNTERS WOULD STEAL BACK OF THE HERD AND AT A GIVEN SIGNAL CHASE THEM
8296-279865-0070 THE BUFFALOES WOULD RUN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DISGUISED BRAVE WHO WOULD LEAD THEM
8296-279865-0071 AS HE REACHED THE EDGE HE WOULD QUICKLY HIDE HIMSELF IN SOME CREVICE
8296-279865-0072 WHO IN THEIR TURN WOULD BE CLOSELY PURSUED BY THE HUNTERS THE WHOLE HERD THEREFORE WOULD USUALLY RUSH OVER THE CLIFF AND THE HUNTERS
8296-279865-0073 THIS METHOD OF HUNTING WAS VERY EXTRAVAGANT BUT AT THAT TIME THE INDIANS HAD NO THOUGHT OF PRESERVING THE BUFFALOES ONE OF THE RIVERS LEWIS PASSED IN THIS REGION HE NAMED THE SLAUGHTER RIVER ON ACCOUNT OF THIS WAY OF HUNTING
8296-279865-0074 WHEN THE MISSOURI TURNED SOUTHWARD THE EXPLORERS CAME TO MANY STEEP RAPIDS AROUND WHICH THE CANOES HAD TO BE CARRIED WHICH MADE TRAVELING SLOW
8296-279865-0075 IN THE OPENING SPRING EVEN IN THAT BARE COUNTRY LEWIS FOUND PLACES NEAR THE RIVER FILLED WITH CHOKE CHERRIES YELLOW CURRANTS WILD ROSES AND PRICKLY PEARS IN FULL BLOOM IN THE DISTANCE THE MOUNTAINS
8296-279865-0076 AHMATEAHZA OR MISSOURI WHICH THEY HAD SAID APPROACHED VERY NEAR TO THE COLUMBIA RIVER LEWIS KNEW THAT THE SUCCESS OF HIS EXPEDITION DEPENDED LARGELY UPON CHOOSING THE RIGHT STREAM BECAUSE
8296-279865-0077 HAD ASCENDED THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS BEYOND THEY SHOULD FIND THAT THE RIVER THEY HAD TAKEN DID NOT BRING THEM NEAR THE COLUMBIA THEY WOULD HAVE TO RETURN AND THEREBY WOULD LOSE A LARGE PART OF THE SUMMER WHICH WAS THE ONLY SEASON WHEN THEY COULD TRAVEL
8296-279865-0078 AND IF HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO CATCH HIMSELF WITH HIS MOUNTAIN STICK
8296-279865-0079 AND HAD SLIPPED DOWN TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE PRECIPICE WHERE HE LAY WITH HIS RIGHT ARM AND LEG OVER THE CLIFF
8296-279865-0080 LEWIS SAW THE DANGER BUT CALMLY TOLD THE OTHER TO TAKE HIS KNIFE FROM HIS BELT WITH HIS RIGHT HAND
8296-279865-0081 WITH GREAT PRESENCE OF MIND THE MAN DID THIS AND GETTING A FOOTHOLD RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES
8296-279865-0082 HIS KNIFE IN ONE HAND AND HIS RIFLE IN THE OTHER IN THIS MANNER THE MAN REGAINED A SECURE PLACE ON THE CLIFF CAPTAIN LEWIS CONSIDERED THAT THIS METHOD OF TRAVELING WAS TOO DANGEROUS
8296-279865-0083 WHERE THE WATER WAS ONLY BREAST HIGH THIS ADVENTURE TAUGHT THEM THE DANGER OF CROSSING THE SLIPPERY HEIGHTS ABOVE THE STREAM BUT AS THE PLAINS WERE BROKEN BY RAVINES ALMOST AS DIFFICULT TO PASS
8296-279865-0084 THEY THEREFORE HID THEIR HEAVIEST BOAT
8296-279865-0085 THE RIVER THREE HUNDRED YARDS WIDE WAS SHUT IN BY STEEP CLIFFS AND FOR NINETY YARDS FROM THE LEFT CLIFF THE WATER FELL
8296-279865-0086 THE REST OF THE RIVER SHOT FORWARD WITH GREATER FORCE AND BEING BROKEN BY PROJECTING ROCKS SENT CLOUDS OF FOAM INTO THE AIR AS THE WATER STRUCK THE BASIN BELOW THE FALLS
8296-279865-0087 AND LEWIS FOUND THAT FOR THREE MILES
8296-279865-0088 WAS ONE LINE OF RAPIDS AND CASCADES OVERHUNG BY BLUFFS FIVE MILES ABOVE THE FIRST FALLS THE WHOLE RIVER WAS BLOCKED BY ONE STRAIGHT SHELF OF ROCK OVER WHICH THE WATER RAN IN AN EVEN SHEET A MAJESTIC SIGHT
8296-279865-0089 THIS PART OF THE MISSOURI HOWEVER OFFERED GREAT DIFFICULTIES TO THEIR TRAVEL
8296-279865-0090 OF STEEP FALLS AND RAPIDS
8296-279865-0091 AND THE CARPENTER BUILT A CARRIAGE TO TRANSPORT THE BOATS
8296-279865-0092 MEANTIME CLARK STUDIED THE RIVER AND FOUND THAT A SERIES OF RAPIDS MADE A PERILOUS DESCENT AND THAT A PORTAGE OF THIRTEEN MILES WOULD BE NECESSARY
8296-279865-0093 THEY HAD TO STOP AND SEARCH FOR A SUBSTITUTE AND FINALLY FOUND WILLOW TREES WHICH PROVIDED THEM WITH ENOUGH WOOD TO PATCH UP THE BOAT CARRIAGE
8296-279865-0094 HALF A MILE FROM THEIR NEW CAMPING PLACE THE CARRIAGE BROKE AGAIN AND THIS TIME THEY FOUND IT EASIER TO CARRY BOAT AND BAGGAGE THAN TO BUILD A NEW CONVEYANCE CAPTAIN LEWIS DESCRIBED
8296-279865-0095 THE MEN HE WROTE ARE LOADED AS HEAVILY AS THEIR STRENGTH WILL PERMIT THE CROSSING IS REALLY PAINFUL
8296-279865-0096 FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES FROM THE HEAT AND FATIGUE THEY ARE ALL OBLIGED TO HALT AND REST FREQUENTLY AND AT ALMOST EVERY STOPPING PLACE THEY FALL AND MANY OF THEM ARE ASLEEP IN AN INSTANT
8296-279865-0097 WHILE THEY WERE BUSY MAKING THIS PORTAGE THEY HAD SEVERAL NARROW ESCAPES FROM ATTACKS BY GRIZZLY BEARS
8296-279865-0098 THE SLEEPING MEN WERE IN DANGER FROM THEIR CLAWS A TREMENDOUS STORM ADDED TO THEIR DISCOMFORT AND THE HAILSTONES WERE DRIVEN SO FURIOUSLY BY THE HIGH WIND THAT THEY WOUNDED SOME OF THE MEN
8296-279865-0099 CHABONEAU AND HIS INDIAN WIFE AND YOUNG CHILD
8296-279865-0100 PROTECTED BY SHELVING ROCKS UNDER WHICH THEY COULD TAKE REFUGE
8296-279865-0101 RAIN AND HAIL BEAT UPON THEIR SHELTER
8296-279865-0102 HER HUSBAND ALSO CAUGHT AT HER AND PULLED HER ALONG BUT HE WAS SO MUCH FRIGHTENED AT THE NOISE AND DANGER THAT BUT FOR CLARK'S STEADINESS HE WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILD WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN LOST
8296-279865-0103 HAD THEY WAITED A MINUTE LONGER THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SWEPT INTO THE MISSOURI JUST ABOVE THE GREAT FALLS THEY REACHED THE TOP IN SAFETY AND THERE FOUND YORK
8296-279865-0104 THEY PUSHED ON TO CAMP WHERE THE REST OF THE PARTY HAD ALREADY TAKEN SHELTER AND HAD ABANDONED ALL WORK FOR THAT DAY WHILE THE MEN WERE BUILDING A NEW BOAT OF SKINS CAPTAIN LEWIS SPENT
8296-279865-0105 MUCH TIME STUDYING THE ANIMALS TREES AND PLANTS OF THE REGION MAKING RECORDS OF THEM TO TAKE HOME
8296-279865-0106 IT IS HEARD AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THE DAY AND NIGHT LEWIS WROTE
8296-279865-0107 IN QUICK SUCCESSION IT IS LOUD
8296-279865-0108 OF ORDNANCE AT THE DISTANCE OF THREE MILES THE MINNETAREES FREQUENTLY MENTIONED THIS NOISE LIKE THUNDER
8296-279865-0109 SUPERSTITION OR PERHAPS A FALSEHOOD
8296-279865-0110 BY THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE WATERMEN
