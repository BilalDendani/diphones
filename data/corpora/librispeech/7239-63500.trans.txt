7239-63500-0000 WHO WAS EMPLOYED IN THE INFIRMARY ATTACHED TO HIS DWELLING A VERY REMARKABLE DEGREE OF INTELLIGENCE COMBINED WITH A CONSTANT AND DEEP COMMISERATION FOR THE SICK POOR TO WHOM HE GAVE WITH THE UTMOST ATTENTION AND CARE THE MEDICINE ORDERED BY THE DOCTORS
7239-63500-0001 AND MOREOVER SO STRONG A PREPOSSESSION FOR THE STUDY OF BOTANY AS APPLIED TO MEDICINE THAT WITHOUT ANY TUITION HE HAD COMPOSED AND CLASSIFIED A SORT OF FLORA OF THE PLANTS AROUND THE DWELLING AND THE VICINITY
7239-63500-0002 THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MISTER WILLIS SITUATED ON THE BORDERS OF THE SEA WAS FIFTEEN OR TWENTY LEAGUES FROM THE NEAREST TOWN AND THE MEDICAL MEN OF THE DISTRICT IGNORANT AS THEY WERE GAVE THEMSELVES
7239-63500-0003 NO GREAT DEAL OF CARE OR TROUBLE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE LONG DISTANCE AND THE DIFFICULTY IN PROCURING ANY MEANS OF CONVEYANCE DESIROUS OF REMEDYING SO EXTREME AN INCONVENIENCE IN A COUNTRY SUBJECT TO VIOLENT EPIDEMICS
7239-63500-0004 AND TO HAVE AT HAND AT ALL TIMES A SKILFUL PRACTITIONER THE COLONIST MADE UP HIS MIND TO SEND DAVID TO FRANCE TO LEARN SURGERY AND MEDICINE
7239-63500-0005 AND THE PLANTER PAID ALL THE EXPENSES OF HIS COURSE OF STUDY
7239-63500-0006 RECEIVED THE DEGREE OF SURGEON AND PHYSICIAN WITH THE MOST DISTINGUISHED SUCCESS AND THEN RETURNED TO AMERICA TO PLACE HIMSELF AND HIS SKILL UNDER THE DIRECTION OF HIS MASTER
7239-63500-0007 BUT DAVID OUGHT TO HAVE CONSIDERED HIMSELF FREE AND EMANCIPATED IN FACT AND IN LAW WHEN HE SET FOOT IN FRANCE DAVID'S LOYALTY IS VERY RARE HE HAD PROMISED MISTER WILLIS TO RETURN AND HE DID SO
7239-63500-0008 HE DID NOT CONSIDER AS HIS OWN THE INSTRUCTION WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED WITH HIS MASTER'S MONEY AND BESIDES HE HOPED TO IMPROVE MORALLY AS WELL AS PHYSICALLY THE SUFFERINGS OF THE SLAVES HIS FORMER COMPANIONS HE TRUSTED TO BECOME NOT ONLY THEIR DOCTOR
7239-63500-0009 BUT SOON RESTORED THROUGH THE CAREFUL ATTENTIONS AND EFFICACIOUS REMEDIES OF DAVID OUT OF THIRTY NEGROES DANGEROUSLY AFFECTED BY THIS FATAL DISEASE ONLY TWO PERISHED MISTER WILLIS
7239-63500-0010 MUCH GRATIFIED BY THE SERVICES WHICH DAVID HAD SO AUSPICIOUSLY RENDERED
7239-63500-0011 TO THE EXTREME GRATIFICATION OF THE BLACK DOCTOR WHOSE FELLOWS REGARDED HIM AS A DIVINITY AMONGST THEM FOR HE HAD WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY IT IS TRUE OBTAINED FROM THEIR MASTER SOME FEW INDULGENCES AND WAS HOPING TO PROCURE STILL MORE
7239-63500-0012 IN THE MEANWHILE HE CONSOLED THESE POOR PEOPLE AND EXHORTED THEM TO PATIENCE SPAKE TO THEM OF GOD WHO WATCHES OVER THE BLACK AND THE WHITE MAN WITH AN EQUAL EYE OF ANOTHER WORLD NOT PEOPLED WITH MASTERS AND SLAVES
7239-63500-0013 BUT WITH THE JUST AND THE UNJUST OF ANOTHER LIFE IN ETERNITY WHERE MAN WAS NO LONGER THE BEAST OF BURDEN THE PROPERTY THE THING OF HIS FELLOW MAN BUT WHERE THE VICTIMS OF THIS WORLD WERE SO HAPPY THAT THEY PRAYED IN HEAVEN FOR THEIR TORMENTORS
7239-63500-0014 TO THOSE UNHAPPY WRETCHES WHO CONTRARY TO OTHER MEN COUNT WITH BITTER JOY THE HOURS WHICH BRING THEM NEARER TO THE TOMB TO THOSE UNFORTUNATE CREATURES WHO LOOKED FORWARD ONLY TO NOTHINGNESS HEREAFTER
7239-63500-0015 DAVID BREATHED THE LANGUAGE AND THE HOPE OF A FREE AND HAPPY IMMORTALITY
7239-63500-0016 HE WAS THEIR IDOL A YEAR PASSED AWAY IN THIS MANNER
7239-63500-0017 WAS A METISSE ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE NAMED CECILY AND FOR THIS POOR GIRL MISTER WILLIS TOOK A FANCY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HIS ADVANCES WERE REPULSED AND OBSTINATELY RESISTED CECILY WAS IN LOVE
7239-63500-0018 AND WITH DAVID WHO DURING THE LATE FEARFUL DISTEMPER HAD ATTENDED HER WITH THE MOST VIGILANT CARE AFTERWARDS A DEEP AND MUTUAL LOVE REPAID HIM THE DEBT OF GRATITUDE DAVID'S TASTE
7239-63500-0019 WAS TOO REFINED TO ALLOW HIM TO BOAST OF HIS HAPPINESS BEFORE THE TIME WHEN HE SHOULD MARRY CECILY WHICH WAS TO BE WHEN SHE HAD TURNED HER SIXTEENTH YEAR MISTER WILLIS IGNORANT OF THEIR LOVE HAD THROWN HIS HANDKERCHIEF RIGHT ROYALLY AT THE PRETTY METISSE
7239-63500-0020 AND SHE IN DEEP DESPAIR SOUGHT DAVID AND TOLD HIM ALL THE BRUTAL ATTEMPTS THAT SHE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO AND WITH DIFFICULTY ESCAPED THE BLACK COMFORTED HER AND INSTANTLY WENT TO MISTER WILLIS TO REQUEST HER HAND IN MARRIAGE
7239-63500-0021 HE REFUSED HE DID HE SAID HE HAD AN INCLINATION FOR THE GIRL HIMSELF THAT IN HIS LIFE BEFORE HE HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED THE REPULSE OF A SLAVE HE MEANT TO POSSESS HER AND HE WOULD
7239-63500-0022 DAVID MIGHT CHOOSE ANOTHER WIFE OR MISTRESS WHICHSOEVER MIGHT BEST SUIT HIS INCLINATION
7239-63500-0023 AS PRETTY AS CECILY DAVID TALKED OF HIS LOVE LOVE SO LONG AND TENDERLY SHARED AND THE PLANTER SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS DAVID URGED BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN
7239-63500-0024 THE CREOLE HAD THE COOL IMPUDENCE TO TELL HIM THAT IT WAS A BAD EXAMPLE TO SEE A MASTER CONCEDE TO A SLAVE
7239-63500-0025 HE ENTREATED SUPPLICATED AND HIS MASTER LOST HIS TEMPER DAVID BLUSHING TO HUMILIATE HIMSELF FURTHER SPAKE IN A FIRM TONE OF HIS SERVICES AND DISINTERESTEDNESS
7239-63500-0026 THAT HE HAD BEEN CONTENTED WITH A VERY SLENDER SALARY MISTER WILLIS WAS DESPERATELY ENRAGED AND TELLING HIM HE WAS A CONTUMACIOUS SLAVE THREATENED HIM WITH THE CHAIN DAVID REPLIED WITH A FEW BITTER AND VIOLENT WORDS
7239-63500-0027 AND TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS BOUND TO A STAKE HIS SKIN WAS TORN WITH THE LASH WHILST THEY BORE CECILY TO THE HAREM OF THE PLANTER IN HIS SIGHT THE CONDUCT OF THE PLANTER WAS BRUTAL AND HORRIBLE IT WAS ADDING ABSURDITY TO CRUELTY
7239-63500-0028 FOR HE MUST AFTER THAT HAVE REQUIRED THE MAN'S SERVICES PRECISELY SO FOR THAT VERY DAY THE VERY FURY INTO WHICH HE HAD WORKED HIMSELF JOINED TO THE DRUNKENNESS IN WHICH THE BRUTE INDULGED EVERY EVENING
7239-63500-0029 BROUGHT ON AN INFLAMMATORY ATTACK OF THE MOST DANGEROUS DESCRIPTION THE SYMPTOMS OF WHICH APPEARED WITH THE RAPIDITY PECULIAR TO SUCH AFFECTIONS THE PLANTER WAS CARRIED TO HIS BED
7239-63500-0030 HE SENT OFF AN EXPRESS FOR A DOCTOR BUT HE COULD NOT REACH HIS ABODE IN LESS THAN SIX AND THIRTY HOURS REALLY THIS ATTACK SEEMS PROVIDENTIAL THE DESPERATE CONDITION OF THE MAN WAS QUITE DESERVED BY HIM
7239-63500-0031 THE MALADY MADE FEARFUL STRIDES DAVID ONLY COULD SAVE THE COLONIST BUT WILLIS DISTRUSTFUL AS ALL EVIL DOERS ARE IMAGINED THAT THE BLACK WOULD REVENGE HIMSELF
7239-63500-0032 FOR AFTER HAVING SCOURGED HIM WITH A ROD HE HAD THROWN HIM INTO PRISON AT LAST HORRIFIED AT THE PROGRESS OF HIS ILLNESS BROKEN DOWN BY BODILY ANGUISH AND THINKING THAT AS DEATH ALSO STARED HIM IN THE FACE
7239-63500-0033 HE HAD ONE CHANCE LEFT IN TRUSTING TO THE GENEROSITY OF HIS SLAVE AFTER MANY DISTRUSTING DOUBTS WILLIS ORDERED DAVID TO BE UNCHAINED AND DAVID SAVED THE PLANTER FOR FIVE DAYS AND FIVE NIGHTS
7239-63500-0034 HE WATCHED AND TENDED HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN HIS FATHER COUNTERACTING THE DISEASE STEP BY STEP WITH GREAT SKILL AND PERFECT KNOWLEDGE UNTIL AT LAST HE SUCCEEDED IN DEFEATING IT TO THE EXTREME SURPRISE OF THE DOCTOR WHO HAD BEEN SENT FOR
7239-63500-0035 AND WHO DID NOT ARRIVE UNTIL THE SECOND DAY AND WHEN RESTORED TO HEALTH AT LAST THE COLONIST NOT DESIRING TO BLUSH BEFORE HIS OWN SLAVE WHOSE PRESENCE CONSTANTLY OPPRESSED HIM WITH THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS EXCESSIVE NOBLENESS OF CONDUCT
7239-63500-0036 HORRIBLE BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHING DAVID MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE EYES OF HIS BRUTAL MASTER A COMPLETE LIVING REMORSE SUCH CONDUCT WAS DICTATED ALIKE BY REVENGE AND JEALOUSY
7239-63500-0037 FOR HE HAD SAVED THEM BODY AND SOUL THEY KNEW THE CARE HE HAD BESTOWED ON HIM WHEN HE LAY TOSSING WITH FEVER BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH AND SHAKING OFF THE DEADENING APATHY WHICH ORDINARILY BESETS SLAVERY
7239-63500-0038 THESE UNFORTUNATE CREATURES EVINCED THEIR INDIGNATION OR RATHER GRIEF MOST POWERFULLY WHEN THEY SAW DAVID LACERATED BY THE WHIP MISTER WILLIS DEEPLY EXASPERATED AFFECTED TO DISCOVER IN THIS MANIFESTATION THE APPEARANCE OF REVOLT
7239-63500-0039 AND WHEN HE CONSIDERED THE INFLUENCE WHICH DAVID HAD ACQUIRED OVER THE SLAVES HE BELIEVED HIM CAPABLE OF PLACING HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF A REBELLION TO AVENGE HIMSELF OF HIS WRONGS THIS FEAR WAS ANOTHER MOTIVE WITH THE COLONIST
7239-63500-0040 FOR USING DAVID IN THE MOST SHAMEFUL MANNER AND ENTIRELY PREVENTING HIM FROM EFFECTING THE MALICIOUS DESIGNS OF WHICH HE SUSPECTED HIM CONSIDERING HIM AS ACTUATED BY AN IRREPRESSIBLE AMOUNT OF TERROR
7239-63500-0041 THIS CONDUCT SEEMS LESS STUPID BUT QUITE AS FEROCIOUS A SHORT TIME AFTER THESE EVENTS WE ARRIVED IN AMERICA MONSEIGNEUR HAD FREIGHTED A DANISH BRIG AT SAINT THOMAS'S AND WE VISITED INCOGNITO ALL THE SETTLEMENTS OF THE AMERICAN COAST
7239-63500-0042 ALONG WHICH WE WERE SAILING WE WERE MOST HOSPITABLY RECEIVED BY MISTER WILLIS WHO THE EVENING AFTER OUR ARRIVAL AFTER HE HAD BEEN DRINKING AND AS MUCH FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF WINE AS FROM A DESIRE TO BOAST TOLD US IN A HORRID TONE OF BRUTAL JESTING
7239-63500-0043 THE HISTORY OF DAVID AND CECILY I FORGOT TO SAY THAT AFTER HAVING MALTREATED THE GIRL HE HAD THROWN HER INTO A DUNGEON ALSO AS A PUNISHMENT FOR HER DISDAIN OF HIM HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS ON HEARING WILLIS'S FEARFUL NARRATION
7239-63500-0044 WELL WHAT FOLLOWED IN MY LIFE I NEVER SAW SO DISTRESSING A SPECTACLE PALE WAN MEAGRE HALF NAKED AND COVERED WITH WOUNDS DAVID AND THE UNHAPPY GIRL CHAINED BY THE MIDDLE OF THE BODY
7239-63500-0045 LOOKED LIKE SPECTRES THE LANTERN THAT LIGHTED US THREW OVER THIS SCENE A STILL MORE GHASTLY HUE DAVID DID NOT UTTER A WORD WHEN HE SAW US HIS GAZE WAS FIXED AND FEARFUL
7239-63500-0046 THE COLONIST SAID TO HIM WITH CRUEL IRONY WELL DOCTOR HOW GOES IT YOU WHO ARE SO CLEVER WHY DON'T YOU CURE YOURSELF THE BLACK REPLIED BY A NOBLE WORD AND A DIGNIFIED GESTURE HE RAISED HIS RIGHT HAND SLOWLY
7239-63500-0047 HIS FOREFINGER POINTED TO THE ROOF AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE COLONIST SAID IN A SOLEMN TONE GOD AND THEN WAS SILENT GOD REPLIED THE PLANTER BURSTING INTO A LOUD FIT OF LAUGHTER TELL HIM THEN
7239-63500-0048 TELL GOD TO COME AND SNATCH YOU FROM MY POWER I DEFY HIM THEN WILLIS OVERCOME BY FURY AND INTOXICATION SHOOK HIS FIST TO HEAVEN AND SAID IN BLASPHEMOUS LANGUAGE YES I DEFY GOD TO CARRY OFF MY SLAVES BEFORE THEY ARE DEAD
7239-63500-0049 THE MAN WAS MAD AS WELL AS BRUTAL WE WERE UTTERLY DISGUSTED MONSEIGNEUR DID NOT SAY A WORD AND WE LEFT THE CELL THIS DUNGEON WAS SITUATED AS WELL AS THE HOUSE ON THE SEASHORE
7239-63500-0050 WE RETURNED TO OUR BRIG WHICH WAS MOORED A SHORT DISTANCE OFF AND AT ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN ALL IN THE BUILDING WERE PLUNGED IN PROFOUND SLEEP MONSEIGNEUR WENT ON SHORE WITH EIGHT MEN WELL ARMED AND GOING STRAIGHT TO THE PRISON
7239-63500-0051 BURST OPEN THE DOORS AND FREED DAVID AND CECILY THE TWO VICTIMS WERE CARRIED ON BOARD SO QUIETLY THAT THEY WERE NOT PERCEIVED AND THEN MONSEIGNEUR AND I WENT TO THE PLANTER'S HOUSE STRANGE CONTRAST
7239-63500-0052 THESE MEN TORTURE THEIR SLAVES AND YET DO NOT TAKE ANY PRECAUTION AGAINST THEM BUT SLEEP WITH DOORS AND WINDOWS OPEN WE EASILY GOT ACCESS TO THE SLEEPING ROOM OF THE PLANTER WHICH WAS LIGHTED ON THE INSIDE BY A SMALL GLASS LAMP
7239-63500-0053 WHO SAT UPRIGHT IN HIS BED HIS BRAIN STILL DISTURBED BY THE EFFECT OF HIS DRUNKENNESS YOU HAVE TO NIGHT DEFIED GOD TO CARRY OFF YOUR TWO VICTIMS BEFORE THEIR DEATH AND HE HAS TAKEN THEM SAID MONSEIGNEUR
7239-63500-0054 THEN TAKING A BAG WHICH I CARRIED
7239-63500-0055 HE THREW IT ON THE FELLOW'S BED AND ADDED
7239-63500-0056 I OPPOSE A VIOLENCE THAT SAVES GOD WILL JUDGE BETWEEN US WE THEN RETREATED LEAVING MISTER WILLIS STUPEFIED MOTIONLESS AND BELIEVING HIMSELF UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A DREAM
7239-63500-0057 A FEW MINUTES LATER WE WERE AGAIN ON BOARD THE BRIG WHICH INSTANTLY SET SAIL IT APPEARS TO ME MY DEAR MURPHY
7239-63500-0058 FOR IN FACT DAVID NO LONGER BELONGED TO HIM WE CALCULATED AS NEARLY AS WE COULD THE EXPENSE WHICH HIS STUDIES HAD COST FOR EIGHT YEARS AND THEN THE PRICE THRICE OVER OF HIMSELF AND CECILY AS SLAVES
7239-63500-0059 OUR CONDUCT WAS CONTRARY TO THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY I KNOW BUT IF YOU HAD SEEN IN WHAT A HORRIBLE STATE WE FOUND THIS UNFORTUNATE AND HALF DEAD COUPLE IF YOU HAD HEARD THE SACRILEGIOUS DEFIANCE
7239-63500-0060 DRUNK WITH WINE AND FEROCITY YOU WOULD COMPREHEND HOW MONSEIGNEUR DESIRED AS HE SAID ON THIS OCCASION TO ACT AS IT WERE IN BEHALF OF PROVIDENCE
7239-63500-0061 ALL THIS IS AS ASSAILABLE AND AS JUSTIFIABLE AS THE PUNISHMENT OF THE SCHOOLMASTER MY WORTHY SQUIRE AND HAD NOT THIS ADVENTURE ANY CONSEQUENCES IT COULD NOT
7239-63500-0062 THE INCOGNITO OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS WAS CLOSELY KEPT WE WERE TAKEN FOR RICH ENGLISHMEN TO WHOM COULD WILLIS HAVE ADDRESSED HIS COMPLAINTS IF HE HAD ANY TO MAKE IN FACT HE HAD TOLD US HIMSELF
7239-63500-0063 AND THE MEDICAL MAN OF MONSEIGNEUR DECLARED IT IN A PROCES VERBAL THAT THE TWO SLAVES COULD NOT HAVE LIVED EIGHT DAYS LONGER IN THIS FRIGHTFUL DUNGEON IT REQUIRED THE GREATEST POSSIBLE CARE TO SNATCH DAVID AND CECILY FROM ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH
7239-63500-0064 FROM THIS PERIOD DAVID HAS BEEN ATTACHED TO THE SUITE OF MONSEIGNEUR AS A MEDICAL MAN AND IS MOST DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO HIM DAVID MARRIED CECILY OF COURSE ON ARRIVING IN EUROPE THIS MARRIAGE
7239-63500-0065 WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED BY RESULTS SO HAPPY TOOK PLACE IN THE CHAPEL OF THE PALACE OF MONSEIGNEUR BUT BY A MOST EXTRAORDINARY REVULSION OF CONDUCT HARDLY WAS SHE IN THE FULL ENJOYMENT OF AN UNHOPED FOR POSITION
7239-63500-0066 WHEN FORGETTING ALL THAT DAVID HAD SUFFERED FOR HER AND WHAT SHE HAD SUFFERED FOR HIM BLUSHING IN THE NEW WORLD TO BE WEDDED TO A BLACK CECILY SEDUCED BY A MAN OF MOST DEPRAVED MORALS COMMITTED HER FIRST FAULT
7239-63500-0067 HAVING TILL THEN SLUMBERED WAS SUDDENLY AWAKENED AND DEVELOPED ITSELF WITH FEARFUL ENERGY YOU KNOW THE REST AND ALL THE SCANDAL OF THE ADVENTURES THAT FOLLOWED AFTER HAVING BEEN TWO YEARS A WIFE DAVID
7239-63500-0068 WHOSE CONFIDENCE IN HER WAS ONLY EQUALLED BY HIS LOVE
7239-63500-0069 THEY SAY HE TRIED TO KILL HIS WIFE YES BUT THROUGH THE INTERFERENCE OF MONSEIGNEUR
7239-63500-0070 MY DEAR BARON BUT IT IS GROWING LATE AND HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS IS ANXIOUS THAT YOUR COURIER SHOULD START FOR GEROLSTEIN WITH AS LITTLE DELAY AS POSSIBLE IN TWO HOURS TIME HE SHALL BE ON THE ROAD
7239-63500-0071 SO NOW MY DEAR MURPHY FAREWELL TILL THE EVENING TILL THE EVENING ADIEU HAVE YOU THEN FORGOTTEN THAT THERE IS A GRAND BALL AT THE EMBASSY AND THAT HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL BE PRESENT
7239-63500-0072 TRUE I HAVE ALWAYS FORGOTTEN THAT SINCE THE ABSENCE OF COLONEL VERNER
7239-63500-0073 I HAVE THE HONOUR TO FULFIL THE FUNCTIONS OF CHAMBERLAIN AND AIDE DE CAMP
7239-63500-0074 WHEN MAY WE EXPECT THEIR RETURN WILL THEY HAVE SOON COMPLETED THEIR RESPECTIVE MISSIONS YOU KNOW THAT MONSEIGNEUR WILL KEEP THEM AWAY AS LONG AS POSSIBLE THAT HE MAY ENJOY MORE SOLITUDE AND LIBERTY
7239-63500-0075 AS TO THE ERRAND ON WHICH HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS HAS EMPLOYED EACH OF THEM AS AN OSTENSIBLE MOTIVE FOR GETTING RID OF THEM IN A QUIET WAY SENDING ONE TO AVIGNON AND THE OTHER TO STRASBOURG I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT SOME DAY
7239-63500-0076 WHEN WE ARE BOTH IN A DULL MOOD FOR I WILL DEFY THE MOST HYPOCHONDRIACAL PERSON IN EXISTENCE NOT TO BURST WITH LAUGHTER AT THE NARRATIVE AS WELL AS WITH CERTAIN PASSAGES IN THE DESPATCHES OF THESE WORTHY GENTLEMEN
7239-63500-0077 WHO HAVE ASSUMED THEIR PRETENDED MISSIONS WITH SO SERIOUS AN AIR TO TELL THE TRUTH I HAVE NEVER CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD WHY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS ATTACHED THE COLONEL AND THE COUNT TO HIS PRIVATE PERSON
7239-63500-0078 WHY MY DEAR FELLOW
7239-63500-0079 IS THERE IN THE WHOLE GERMANIC CONFEDERATION A MORE ELEGANT FIGURE MORE FLOURISHING AND SPLENDID MOUSTACHES AND A MORE COMPLETE MILITARY FIGURE AND WHEN HE IS FULLY DECORATED SCREWED IN
7239-63500-0080 UNIFORMED GOLD LACED PLUMED ET CETERA ET CETERA IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE A MORE GLORIOUS SELF SATISFIED PROUD HANDSOME ANIMAL TRUE BUT IT IS HIS VERY GOOD LOOKS THAT PREVENT HIM
7239-63500-0081 WELL AND MONSEIGNEUR SAYS THAT THANKS TO THE COLONEL HE IS IN THE HABIT OF FINDING EVEN THE DULLEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BEARABLE BEFORE CERTAIN AUDIENCES WHICH ARE OF NECESSITY
7239-63500-0082 QUITE READY TO MEET BORES AND DEFY THEM JUST AS THE ROMAN SOLDIER WHO BEFORE A FORCED MARCH USED TO SOLE HIS SANDALS WITH LEAD AND SO FOUND ALL FATIGUE LIGHT BY LEAVING THEM OFF I NOW DISCOVER THE USEFULNESS OF THE COLONEL
7239-63500-0083 IS ALSO VERY SERVICEABLE TO OUR DEAR LORD FOR ALWAYS HEARING AT HIS SIDE THE TINKLING OF THIS OLD CRACKED BELL SHINING AND CHATTERING CONTINUALLY SEEING THIS SOAP BUBBLE SO PUFFED UP WITH NOTHINGNESS
7239-63500-0084 SO MAGNIFICENTLY VARIEGATED AND AS SUCH PORTRAYING THE THEATRICAL AND PUERILE PHASE OF SOVEREIGN POWER HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS FEELS THE MORE SENSIBLY THE VANITY OF THOSE BARREN POMPS AND GLORIES OF THE WORLD
7239-63500-0085 AND BY CONTRAST HAS OFTEN DERIVED THE MOST SERIOUS AND HAPPY IDEAS FROM THE CONTEMPLATION OF HIS USELESS AND PATTERING CHAMBERLAIN WELL WELL BUT LET US BE JUST MY DEAR MURPHY
7239-63500-0086 TELL ME IN WHAT COURT IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU FIND A MORE PERFECT MODEL OF A CHAMBERLAIN
7239-63500-0087 THE NUMBERLESS RULES AND STRICT OBSERVANCES OF ETIQUETTE WHO BEARS WITH MORE BECOMING DEMEANOUR AN ENAMELLED CROSS AROUND HIS NECK OR MORE MAJESTICALLY COMPORTS HIMSELF
7239-63500-0088 WHEN THE KEYS OF OFFICE ARE SUSPENDED FROM HIS SHOULDERS APROPOS BARON MONSEIGNEUR DECLARES THAT THE SHOULDERS OF A CHAMBERLAIN HAVE A PECULIAR PHYSIOGNOMY
7239-63500-0089 AN APPEARANCE AT ONCE CONSTRAINED AND REPULSIVE WHICH IT IS PAINFUL TO LOOK AT FOR ALAS AND ALACKADAY IT IS AT THE BACK OF A CHAMBERLAIN THAT THE SYMBOL OF HIS OFFICE GLITTERS AND AS MONSEIGNEUR AVERS
7239-63500-0090 TEMPTED TO PRESENT HIMSELF BACKWARDS THAT HIS IMPORTANCE MAY AT ONCE BE SEEN FELT AND ACKNOWLEDGED THE FACT IS THAT THE INCESSANT SUBJECT OF THE COUNT'S MEDITATIONS IS TO ASCERTAIN
7239-63500-0091 BY WHAT FATAL IMAGINATION AND DIRECTION THE CHAMBERLAIN'S KEY HAS BEEN PLACED BEHIND THE CHAMBERLAIN'S BACK FOR IT IS RELATED OF HIM THAT HE SAID WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED GOOD SENSE AND WITH A KIND OF BITTER GRIEF
7239-63500-0092 WHAT THE DEVIL ONE DOES NOT OPEN A DOOR WITH ONE'S BACK AT ALL EVENTS BARON THE COURIER THE COURIER SAID MURPHY POINTING TO THE CLOCK
7239-63500-0093 TAKING HIS HAT UP IN HASTE
