1736-152007-0000 STEPHEN WEARY TOO WITH HIS UNACCUSTOMED AMOUNT OF ROWING AND WITH THE INTENSE INWARD LIFE OF THE LAST TWELVE HOURS BUT TOO RESTLESS TO SLEEP WALKED AND LOUNGED ABOUT THE DECK WITH HIS CIGAR FAR ON INTO MIDNIGHT NOT SEEING THE DARK WATER
1736-152007-0001 HARDLY CONSCIOUS THERE WERE STARS LIVING ONLY IN THE NEAR AND DISTANT FUTURE AT LAST FATIGUE CONQUERED RESTLESSNESS AND HE ROLLED HIMSELF UP IN A PIECE OF TARPAULIN ON THE DECK NEAR MAGGIE'S FEET
1736-152007-0002 SHE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP BEFORE NINE AND HAD BEEN SLEEPING FOR SIX HOURS BEFORE THE FAINTEST HINT OF A MIDSUMMER DAYBREAK WAS DISCERNIBLE SHE AWOKE FROM THAT VIVID DREAMING WHICH MAKES THE MARGIN OF OUR DEEPER REST SHE WAS IN A BOAT ON THE WIDE WATER WITH STEPHEN
1736-152007-0003 AND IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS SOMETHING LIKE A STAR APPEARED THAT GREW AND GREW TILL THEY SAW IT WAS THE VIRGIN SEATED IN SAINT OGG'S BOAT AND IT CAME NEARER AND NEARER
1736-152007-0004 NO NOT PHILIP BUT HER BROTHER WHO ROWED PAST WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER AND SHE ROSE TO STRETCH OUT HER ARMS AND CALL TO HIM AND THEIR OWN BOAT TURNED OVER WITH THE MOVEMENT AND THEY BEGAN TO SINK TILL WITH ONE SPASM OF DREAD SHE SEEMED TO AWAKE
1736-152007-0005 AND FIND SHE WAS A CHILD AGAIN IN THE PARLOR AT EVENING TWILIGHT AND TOM WAS NOT REALLY ANGRY FROM THE SOOTHED SENSE OF THAT FALSE WAKING SHE PASSED TO THE REAL WAKING TO THE PLASH OF WATER AGAINST THE VESSEL AND THE SOUND OF A FOOTSTEP ON THE DECK
1736-152007-0006 AND THE AWFUL STARLIT SKY THERE WAS A MOMENT OF UTTER BEWILDERMENT BEFORE HER MIND COULD GET DISENTANGLED FROM THE CONFUSED WEB OF DREAMS BUT SOON THE WHOLE TERRIBLE TRUTH URGED ITSELF UPON HER STEPHEN WAS NOT BY HER NOW
1736-152007-0007 SHE WAS ALONE WITH HER OWN MEMORY AND HER OWN DREAD THE IRREVOCABLE WRONG THAT MUST BLOT HER LIFE HAD BEEN COMMITTED SHE HAD BROUGHT SORROW INTO THE LIVES OF OTHERS INTO THE LIVES THAT WERE KNIT UP WITH HERS BY TRUST AND LOVE
1736-152007-0008 THE FEELING OF A FEW SHORT WEEKS HAD HURRIED HER INTO THE SINS HER NATURE HAD MOST RECOILED FROM BREACH OF FAITH AND CRUEL SELFISHNESS SHE HAD RENT THE TIES THAT HAD GIVEN MEANING TO DUTY AND HAD MADE HERSELF AN OUTLAWED SOUL
1736-152007-0009 WITH NO GUIDE BUT THE WAYWARD CHOICE OF HER OWN PASSION AND WHERE WOULD THAT LEAD HER WHERE HAD IT LED HER NOW SHE HAD SAID SHE WOULD RATHER DIE THAN FALL INTO THAT TEMPTATION SHE FELT IT NOW
1736-152007-0010 NOW THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A FALL HAD COME BEFORE THE OUTWARD ACT WAS COMPLETED THERE WAS AT LEAST THIS FRUIT FROM ALL HER YEARS OF STRIVING AFTER THE HIGHEST AND BEST THAT HER SOUL THOUGH BETRAYED BEGUILED ENSNARED COULD NEVER DELIBERATELY CONSENT TO A CHOICE OF THE LOWER
1736-152007-0011 AND A CHOICE OF WHAT O GOD NOT A CHOICE OF JOY BUT OF CONSCIOUS CRUELTY AND HARDNESS FOR COULD SHE EVER CEASE TO SEE BEFORE HER LUCY AND PHILIP WITH THEIR MURDERED TRUST AND HOPES HER LIFE WITH STEPHEN COULD HAVE NO SACREDNESS
1736-152007-0012 SHE MUST FOREVER SINK AND WANDER VAGUELY DRIVEN BY UNCERTAIN IMPULSE FOR SHE HAD LET GO THE CLUE OF LIFE THAT CLUE WHICH ONCE IN THE FAR OFF YEARS HER YOUNG NEED HAD CLUTCHED SO STRONGLY
1736-152007-0013 BEFORE SHE KNEW THEM BEFORE THEY HAD COME WITHIN HER REACH PHILIP HAD BEEN RIGHT WHEN HE TOLD HER THAT SHE KNEW NOTHING OF RENUNCIATION SHE HAD THOUGHT IT WAS QUIET ECSTASY SHE SAW IT FACE TO FACE NOW THAT SAD PATIENT LOVING STRENGTH WHICH HOLDS THE CLUE OF LIFE
1736-152007-0014 AND SAW THAT THE THORNS WERE FOREVER PRESSING ON ITS BROW THE YESTERDAY WHICH COULD NEVER BE REVOKED
1736-152007-0015 SHE WOULD HAVE BOWED BENEATH THAT CROSS WITH A SENSE OF REST DAY BREAK CAME AND THE REDDENING EASTERN LIGHT WHILE HER PAST LIFE WAS GRASPING HER IN THIS WAY
1736-152007-0016 SHE COULD SEE STEPHEN NOW LYING ON THE DECK STILL FAST ASLEEP AND WITH THE SIGHT OF HIM THERE CAME A WAVE OF ANGUISH THAT FOUND ITS WAY IN A LONG SUPPRESSED SOB THE WORST BITTERNESS OF PARTING THE THOUGHT THAT URGED THE SHARPEST INWARD CRY FOR HELP
1736-152007-0017 WAS THE PAIN IT MUST GIVE TO HIM BUT SURMOUNTING EVERYTHING WAS THE HORROR AT HER OWN POSSIBLE FAILURE THE DREAD LEST HER CONSCIENCE SHOULD BE BENUMBED AGAIN AND NOT RISE TO ENERGY TILL IT WAS TOO LATE TOO LATE IT WAS TOO LATE ALREADY NOT TO HAVE CAUSED MISERY
1736-152007-0018 TOO LATE FOR EVERYTHING PERHAPS BUT TO RUSH AWAY FROM THE LAST ACT OF BASENESS THE TASTING OF JOYS THAT WERE WRUNG FROM CRUSHED HEARTS THE SUN WAS RISING NOW AND MAGGIE STARTED UP WITH THE SENSE THAT A DAY OF RESISTANCE WAS BEGINNING FOR HER
1736-152007-0019 HER EYELASHES WERE STILL WET WITH TEARS AS WITH HER SHAWL OVER HER HEAD SHE SAT LOOKING AT THE SLOWLY ROUNDING SUN SOMETHING ROUSED STEPHEN TOO AND GETTING UP FROM HIS HARD BED HE CAME TO SIT BESIDE HER
1736-152007-0020 THE SHARP INSTINCT OF ANXIOUS LOVE SAW SOMETHING TO GIVE HIM ALARM IN THE VERY FIRST GLANCE HE HAD A HOVERING DREAD OF SOME RESISTANCE IN MAGGIE'S NATURE THAT HE WOULD BE UNABLE TO OVERCOME HE HAD THE UNEASY CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE HAD ROBBED HER OF PERFECT FREEDOM YESTERDAY
1736-152007-0021 THERE WAS TOO MUCH NATIVE HONOR IN HIM FOR HIM NOT TO FEEL THAT IF HER WILL SHOULD RECOIL HIS CONDUCT WOULD HAVE BEEN ODIOUS AND SHE WOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO REPROACH HIM BUT MAGGIE DID NOT FEEL THAT RIGHT SHE WAS TOO CONSCIOUS OF FATAL WEAKNESS IN HERSELF
1736-152007-0022 TOO FULL OF THE TENDERNESS THAT COMES WITH THE FORESEEN NEED FOR INFLICTING A WOUND SHE LET HIM TAKE HER HAND WHEN HE CAME TO SIT DOWN BESIDE HER AND SMILED AT HIM ONLY WITH RATHER A SAD GLANCE SHE COULD SAY NOTHING TO PAIN HIM TILL THE MOMENT OF POSSIBLE PARTING WAS NEARER
1736-152007-0023 AND SO THEY DRANK THEIR CUP OF COFFEE TOGETHER AND WALKED ABOUT THE DECK AND HEARD THE CAPTAIN'S ASSURANCE THAT THEY SHOULD BE IN AT MUDPORT BY FIVE O'CLOCK EACH WITH AN INWARD BURTHEN BUT IN HIM IT WAS AN UNDEFINED FEAR WHICH HE TRUSTED TO THE COMING HOURS TO DISSIPATE
1736-152007-0024 IN HER IT WAS A DEFINITE RESOLVE ON WHICH SHE WAS TRYING SILENTLY TO TIGHTEN HER HOLD STEPHEN WAS CONTINUALLY THROUGH THE MORNING EXPRESSING HIS ANXIETY AT THE FATIGUE AND DISCOMFORT SHE WAS SUFFERING
1736-152007-0025 AND ALLUDED TO LANDING AND TO THE CHANGE OF MOTION AND REPOSE SHE WOULD HAVE IN A CARRIAGE WANTING TO ASSURE HIMSELF MORE COMPLETELY BY PRESUPPOSING THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE AS HE HAD ARRANGED IT FOR A LONG WHILE MAGGIE CONTENTED HERSELF WITH ASSURING HIM THAT SHE HAD HAD A GOOD NIGHT'S REST
1736-152007-0026 AND THAT SHE DIDN'T MIND ABOUT BEING ON THE VESSEL IT WAS NOT LIKE BEING ON THE OPEN SEA IT WAS ONLY A LITTLE LESS PLEASANT THAN BEING IN A BOAT ON THE FLOSS BUT A SUPPRESSED RESOLVE WILL BETRAY ITSELF IN THE EYES
1736-152007-0027 AND STEPHEN BECAME MORE AND MORE UNEASY AS THE DAY ADVANCED UNDER THE SENSE THAT MAGGIE HAD ENTIRELY LOST HER PASSIVENESS HE LONGED BUT DID NOT DARE TO SPEAK OF THEIR MARRIAGE OF WHERE THEY WOULD GO AFTER IT AND THE STEPS HE WOULD TAKE TO INFORM HIS FATHER AND THE REST OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED
1736-152007-0028 HE LONGED TO ASSURE HIMSELF OF A TACIT ASSENT FROM HER BUT EACH TIME HE LOOKED AT HER HE GATHERED A STRONGER DREAD OF THE NEW QUIET SADNESS WITH WHICH SHE MET HIS EYES AND THEY WERE MORE AND MORE SILENT HERE WE ARE IN SIGHT OF MUDPORT HE SAID AT LAST
1736-152007-0029 NOW DEAREST HE ADDED TURNING TOWARD HER WITH A LOOK THAT WAS HALF BESEECHING THE WORST PART OF YOUR FATIGUE IS OVER ON THE LAND WE CAN COMMAND SWIFTNESS IN ANOTHER HOUR AND A HALF WE SHALL BE IN A CHAISE TOGETHER AND THAT WILL SEEM REST TO YOU AFTER THIS
1736-152007-0030 SHE SPOKE IN THE LOWEST TONE AS HE HAD DONE BUT WITH DISTINCT DECISION WE SHALL NOT BE TOGETHER WE SHALL HAVE PARTED THE BLOOD RUSHED TO STEPHEN'S FACE WE SHALL NOT HE SAID I'LL DIE FIRST
1736-152007-0031 IT WAS AS HE HAD DREADED THERE WAS A STRUGGLE COMING BUT NEITHER OF THEM DARED TO SAY ANOTHER WORD TILL THE BOAT WAS LET DOWN AND THEY WERE TAKEN TO THE LANDING PLACE HERE THERE WAS A CLUSTER OF GAZERS AND PASSENGERS AWAITING THE DEPARTURE OF THE STEAMBOAT TO SAINT OGG'S
1736-152007-0032 AND STEPHEN WAS HURRYING HER ALONG ON HIS ARM THAT SOME ONE HAD ADVANCED TOWARD HER FROM THAT CLUSTER AS IF HE WERE COMING TO SPEAK TO HER BUT SHE WAS HURRIED ALONG AND WAS INDIFFERENT TO EVERYTHING BUT THE COMING TRIAL A PORTER GUIDED THEM TO THE NEAREST INN AND POSTING HOUSE
1736-152007-0033 AND STEPHEN GAVE THE ORDER FOR THE CHAISE AS THEY PASSED THROUGH THE YARD MAGGIE TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS AND ONLY SAID
1736-152007-0034 WHEN THEY ENTERED MAGGIE DID NOT SIT DOWN AND STEPHEN WHOSE FACE HAD A DESPERATE DETERMINATION IN IT WAS ABOUT TO RING THE BELL WHEN SHE SAID IN A FIRM VOICE I'M NOT GOING WE MUST PART HERE MAGGIE
1736-152007-0035 NO IT IS NOT DONE SAID MAGGIE TOO MUCH IS DONE MORE THAN WE CAN EVER REMOVE THE TRACE OF BUT I WILL GO NO FARTHER DON'T TRY TO PREVAIL WITH ME AGAIN I COULDN'T CHOOSE YESTERDAY WHAT WAS HE TO DO HE DARED NOT GO NEAR HER
1736-152007-0036 HER ANGER MIGHT LEAP OUT AND MAKE A NEW BARRIER HE WALKED BACKWARD AND FORWARD IN MADDENING PERPLEXITY MAGGIE HE SAID AT LAST PAUSING BEFORE HER AND SPEAKING IN A TONE OF IMPLORING WRETCHEDNESS
1736-152007-0037 FORGIVE ME FOR WHAT I DID YESTERDAY I WILL OBEY YOU NOW I WILL DO NOTHING WITHOUT YOUR FULL CONSENT BUT DON'T BLIGHT OUR LIVES FOREVER BY A RASH PERVERSITY THAT CAN ANSWER NO GOOD PURPOSE TO ANY ONE THAT CAN ONLY CREATE NEW EVILS SIT DOWN DEAREST WAIT
1736-152007-0038 THINK WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO DON'T TREAT ME AS IF YOU COULDN'T TRUST ME HE HAD CHOSEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE APPEAL BUT MAGGIE'S WILL WAS FIXED UNSWERVINGLY ON THE COMING WRENCH SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND TO SUFFER WE MUST NOT WAIT
1736-152007-0039 SHE SAID IN A LOW BUT DISTINCT VOICE WE MUST PART AT ONCE WE CAN'T PART MAGGIE SAID STEPHEN MORE IMPETUOUSLY I CAN'T BEAR IT WHAT IS THE USE OF INFLICTING THAT MISERY ON ME
1736-152007-0040 THE BLOW WHATEVER IT MAY HAVE BEEN HAS BEEN STRUCK NOW WILL IT HELP ANY ONE ELSE THAT YOU SHOULD DRIVE ME MAD I WILL NOT BEGIN ANY FUTURE EVEN FOR YOU SAID MAGGIE TREMULOUSLY
1736-152007-0041 I WOULD RATHER HAVE DIED THAN FALL INTO THIS TEMPTATION
1736-152007-0042 BUT WE MUST PART NOW WE WILL NOT PART STEPHEN BURST OUT INSTINCTIVELY PLACING HIS BACK AGAINST THE DOOR FORGETTING EVERYTHING HE HAD SAID A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE I WILL NOT ENDURE IT YOU'LL MAKE ME DESPERATE I SHA'N'T KNOW WHAT I DO
1736-152007-0043 MAGGIE TREMBLED SHE FELT THAT THE PARTING COULD NOT BE EFFECTED SUDDENLY SHE MUST RELY ON A SLOWER APPEAL TO STEPHEN'S BETTER SELF SHE MUST BE PREPARED FOR A HARDER TASK THAN THAT OF RUSHING AWAY WHILE RESOLUTION WAS FRESH SHE SAT DOWN
1736-152007-0044 STEPHEN WATCHING HER WITH THAT LOOK OF DESPERATION WHICH HAD COME OVER HIM LIKE A LURID LIGHT APPROACHED SLOWLY FROM THE DOOR SEATED HIMSELF CLOSE BESIDE HER AND GRASPED HER HAND HER HEART BEAT LIKE THE HEART OF A FRIGHTENED BIRD BUT THIS DIRECT OPPOSITION HELPED HER
1736-152007-0045 SHE FELT HER DETERMINATION GROWING STRONGER REMEMBER WHAT YOU FELT WEEKS AGO SHE BEGAN WITH BESEECHING EARNESTNESS
1736-152007-0046 THAT NATURAL LAW SURMOUNTS EVERY OTHER WE CAN'T HELP WHAT IT CLASHES WITH IT IS NOT SO STEPHEN I'M QUITE SURE THAT IS WRONG I HAVE TRIED TO THINK IT AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT I SEE IF WE JUDGED IN THAT WAY THERE WOULD BE A WARRANT FOR ALL TREACHERY AND CRUELTY
1736-152007-0047 IF THE PAST IS NOT TO BIND US WHERE CAN DUTY LIE WE SHOULD HAVE NO LAW BUT THE INCLINATION OF THE MOMENT BUT THERE ARE TIES THAT CAN'T BE KEPT BY MERE RESOLUTION SAID STEPHEN STARTING UP AND WALKING ABOUT AGAIN WHAT IS OUTWARD FAITHFULNESS
1736-152007-0048 WOULD THEY HAVE THANKED US FOR ANYTHING SO HOLLOW AS CONSTANCY WITHOUT LOVE MAGGIE DID NOT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY SHE WAS UNDERGOING AN INWARD AS WELL AS AN OUTWARD CONTEST AT LAST SHE SAID WITH A PASSIONATE ASSERTION OF HER CONVICTION
1736-152007-0049 AS MUCH AGAINST HERSELF AS AGAINST HIM THAT SEEMS RIGHT AT FIRST BUT WHEN I LOOK FURTHER I'M SURE IT IS NOT RIGHT FAITHFULNESS AND CONSTANCY MEAN SOMETHING ELSE BESIDES DOING WHAT IS EASIEST AND PLEASANTEST TO OURSELVES
1736-152007-0050 WHATEVER WOULD CAUSE MISERY TO THOSE WHOM THE COURSE OF OUR LIVES HAS MADE DEPENDENT ON US IF WE IF I HAD BEEN BETTER NOBLER THOSE CLAIMS WOULD HAVE BEEN SO STRONGLY PRESENT WITH ME I SHOULD HAVE FELT THEM PRESSING ON MY HEART SO CONTINUALLY
1736-152007-0051 THAT THE OPPOSITE FEELING WOULD NEVER HAVE GROWN IN ME AS IT HAS DONE
1736-152007-0052 I SHOULD HAVE PRAYED FOR HELP SO EARNESTLY I SHOULD HAVE RUSHED AWAY AS WE RUSH FROM HIDEOUS DANGER I FEEL NO EXCUSE FOR MYSELF NONE I SHOULD NEVER HAVE FAILED TOWARD LUCY AND PHILIP AS I HAVE DONE IF I HAD NOT BEEN WEAK SELFISH AND HARD
1736-152007-0053 ABLE TO THINK OF THEIR PAIN WITHOUT A PAIN TO MYSELF THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED ALL TEMPTATION OH WHAT IS LUCY FEELING NOW SHE BELIEVED IN ME SHE LOVED ME SHE WAS SO GOOD TO ME THINK OF HER
1736-152007-0054 MAGGIE'S VOICE WAS GETTING CHOKED AS SHE UTTERED THESE LAST WORDS I CAN'T THINK OF HER SAID STEPHEN STAMPING AS IF WITH PAIN I CAN THINK OF NOTHING BUT YOU MAGGIE YOU DEMAND OF A MAN WHAT IS IMPOSSIBLE I FELT THAT ONCE BUT I CAN'T GO BACK TO IT NOW
1736-152007-0055 AND WHERE IS THE USE OF YOUR THINKING OF IT EXCEPT TO TORTURE ME YOU CAN'T SAVE THEM FROM PAIN NOW YOU CAN ONLY TEAR YOURSELF FROM ME AND MAKE MY LIFE WORTHLESS TO ME AND EVEN IF WE COULD GO BACK AND BOTH FULFIL OUR ENGAGEMENTS IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE NOW
1736-152007-0056 IT WOULD BE HATEFUL HORRIBLE TO THINK OF YOUR EVER BEING PHILIP'S WIFE OF YOUR EVER BEING THE WIFE OF A MAN YOU DIDN'T LOVE WE HAVE BOTH BEEN RESCUED FROM A MISTAKE A DEEP FLUSH CAME OVER MAGGIE'S FACE AND SHE COULDN'T SPEAK STEPHEN SAW THIS
1736-152007-0057 HE SAT DOWN AGAIN TAKING HER HAND IN HIS AND LOOKING AT HER WITH PASSIONATE ENTREATY MAGGIE DEAREST IF YOU LOVE ME YOU ARE MINE WHO CAN HAVE SO GREAT A CLAIM ON YOU AS I HAVE MY LIFE IS BOUND UP IN YOUR LOVE
1736-152007-0058 THERE IS NOTHING IN THE PAST THAT CAN ANNUL OUR RIGHT TO EACH OTHER IT IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE EITHER OF US LOVED WITH OUR WHOLE HEART AND SOUL MAGGIE WAS STILL SILENT FOR A LITTLE WHILE LOOKING DOWN STEPHEN WAS IN A FLUTTER OF NEW HOPE
1736-152007-0059 HE WAS GOING TO TRIUMPH BUT SHE RAISED HER EYES AND MET HIS WITH A GLANCE THAT WAS FILLED WITH THE ANGUISH OF REGRET NOT WITH YIELDING NO NOT WITH MY WHOLE HEART AND SOUL STEPHEN SHE SAID WITH TIMID RESOLUTION
1736-152007-0060 I HAVE NEVER CONSENTED TO IT WITH MY WHOLE MIND THERE ARE MEMORIES AND AFFECTIONS AND LONGINGS AFTER PERFECT GOODNESS THAT HAVE SUCH A STRONG HOLD ON ME THEY WOULD NEVER QUIT ME FOR LONG THEY WOULD COME BACK AND BE PAIN TO ME REPENTANCE
1736-152007-0061 I COULDN'T LIVE IN PEACE IF I PUT THE SHADOW OF A WILFUL SIN BETWEEN MYSELF AND GOD I HAVE CAUSED SORROW ALREADY I KNOW I FEEL IT BUT I HAVE NEVER DELIBERATELY CONSENTED TO IT I HAVE NEVER SAID THEY SHALL SUFFER THAT I MAY HAVE JOY
1736-152007-0062 IT HAS NEVER BEEN MY WILL TO MARRY YOU IF YOU WERE TO WIN CONSENT FROM THE MOMENTARY TRIUMPH OF MY FEELING FOR YOU YOU WOULD NOT HAVE MY WHOLE SOUL IF I COULD WAKE BACK AGAIN INTO THE TIME BEFORE YESTERDAY I WOULD CHOOSE TO BE TRUE TO MY CALMER AFFECTIONS AND LIVE WITHOUT THE JOY OF LOVE
1736-152007-0063 STEPHEN LOOSED HER HAND AND RISING IMPATIENTLY WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN SUPPRESSED RAGE GOOD GOD HE BURST OUT AT LAST WHAT A MISERABLE THING A WOMAN'S LOVE IS TO A MAN'S I COULD COMMIT CRIMES FOR YOU
1736-152007-0064 AND YOU CAN BALANCE AND CHOOSE IN THAT WAY BUT YOU DON'T LOVE ME IF YOU HAD A TITHE OF THE FEELING FOR ME THAT I HAVE FOR YOU IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO YOU TO THINK FOR A MOMENT OF SACRIFICING ME BUT IT WEIGHS NOTHING WITH YOU THAT YOU ARE ROBBING ME OF MY LIFE'S HAPPINESS
1736-152007-0065 AS IF SHE WERE EVER AND ANON SEEING WHERE SHE STOOD BY GREAT FLASHES OF LIGHTNING AND THEN AGAIN STRETCHED FORTH HER HANDS IN THE DARKNESS NO I DON'T SACRIFICE YOU I COULDN'T SACRIFICE YOU
1736-152007-0066 BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE IN A GOOD FOR YOU THAT I FEEL THAT WE BOTH FEEL IS A WRONG TOWARD OTHERS WE CAN'T CHOOSE HAPPINESS EITHER FOR OURSELVES OR FOR ANOTHER WE CAN'T TELL WHERE THAT WILL LIE WE CAN ONLY CHOOSE WHETHER WE WILL INDULGE OURSELVES IN THE PRESENT MOMENT
1736-152007-0067 OR WHETHER WE WILL RENOUNCE THAT FOR THE SAKE OF OBEYING THE DIVINE VOICE WITHIN US FOR THE SAKE OF BEING TRUE TO ALL THE MOTIVES THAT SANCTIFY OUR LIVES I KNOW THIS BELIEF IS HARD
1736-152007-0068 BUT I HAVE FELT THAT IF I LET IT GO FOREVER
1736-152007-0069 BUT MAGGIE SAID STEPHEN SEATING HIMSELF BY HER AGAIN IS IT POSSIBLE YOU DON'T SEE THAT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY HAS ALTERED THE WHOLE POSITION OF THINGS WHAT INFATUATION IS IT WHAT OBSTINATE PREPOSSESSION THAT BLINDS YOU TO THAT
1736-152007-0070 IT IS TOO LATE TO SAY WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE DONE OR WHAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE ADMITTING THE VERY WORST VIEW OF WHAT HAS BEEN DONE IT IS A FACT WE MUST ACT ON NOW OUR POSITION IS ALTERED THE RIGHT COURSE IS NO LONGER WHAT IT WAS BEFORE
1736-152007-0071 WE MUST ACCEPT OUR OWN ACTIONS AND START AFRESH FROM THEM SUPPOSE WE HAD BEEN MARRIED YESTERDAY IT IS NEARLY THE SAME THING THE EFFECT ON OTHERS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IT WOULD ONLY HAVE MADE THIS DIFFERENCE TO OURSELVES STEPHEN ADDED BITTERLY
1736-152007-0072 THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THEN THAT YOUR TIE TO ME WAS STRONGER THAN TO OTHERS
1736-152007-0073 STEPHEN THOUGHT AGAIN THAT HE WAS BEGINNING TO PREVAIL HE HAD NEVER YET BELIEVED THAT HE SHOULD NOT PREVAIL THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES WHICH OUR MINDS SHRINK FROM TOO COMPLETELY FOR US TO FEAR THEM DEAREST
1736-152007-0074 HE SAID IN HIS DEEPEST TENDEREST TONE LEANING TOWARD HER AND PUTTING HIS ARM ROUND HER YOU ARE MINE NOW THE WORLD BELIEVES IT DUTY MUST SPRING OUT OF THAT NOW IN A FEW HOURS YOU WILL BE LEGALLY MINE AND THOSE WHO HAD CLAIMS ON US WILL SUBMIT
1736-152007-0075 THEY WILL SEE THAT THERE WAS A FORCE WHICH DECLARED AGAINST THEIR CLAIMS MAGGIE'S EYES OPENED WIDE IN ONE TERRIFIED LOOK AT THE FACE THAT WAS CLOSE TO HERS
1736-152007-0076 SHE SAID IN A VOICE ALMOST OF AGONY STEPHEN DON'T ASK ME DON'T URGE ME I CAN'T ARGUE ANY LONGER I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS WISE BUT MY HEART WILL NOT LET ME DO IT I SEE I FEEL THEIR TROUBLE NOW IT IS AS IF IT WERE BRANDED ON MY MIND
1736-152007-0077 I HAVE SUFFERED AND HAD NO ONE TO PITY ME AND NOW I HAVE MADE OTHERS SUFFER IT WOULD NEVER LEAVE ME IT WOULD EMBITTER YOUR LOVE TO ME I DO CARE FOR PHILIP IN A DIFFERENT WAY I REMEMBER ALL WE SAID TO EACH OTHER
1736-152007-0078 I KNOW HOW HE THOUGHT OF ME AS THE ONE PROMISE OF HIS LIFE HE WAS GIVEN TO ME THAT I MIGHT MAKE HIS LOT LESS HARD AND I HAVE FORSAKEN HIM AND LUCY SHE HAS BEEN DECEIVED SHE WHO TRUSTED ME MORE THAN ANY ONE
1736-152007-0079 I CANNOT MARRY YOU I CANNOT TAKE A GOOD FOR MYSELF THAT HAS BEEN WRUNG OUT OF THEIR MISERY IT IS NOT THE FORCE THAT OUGHT TO RULE US THIS THAT WE FEEL FOR EACH OTHER IT WOULD REND ME AWAY FROM ALL THAT MY PAST LIFE HAS MADE DEAR AND HOLY TO ME
1736-152007-0080 I CAN'T SET OUT ON A FRESH LIFE AND FORGET THAT I MUST GO BACK TO IT AND CLING TO IT ELSE I SHALL FEEL AS IF THERE WERE NOTHING FIRM BENEATH MY FEET GOOD GOD MAGGIE SAID STEPHEN RISING TOO AND GRASPING HER ARM YOU RAVE
1736-152007-0081 YOU SEE NOTHING AS IT REALLY IS YES I DO BUT THEY WILL BELIEVE ME I WILL CONFESS EVERYTHING LUCY WILL BELIEVE ME SHE WILL FORGIVE YOU AND AND
1736-152007-0082 DEAR DEAR STEPHEN LET ME GO DON'T DRAG ME INTO DEEPER REMORSE MY WHOLE SOUL HAS NEVER CONSENTED IT DOES NOT CONSENT NOW STEPHEN LET GO HER ARM AND SANK BACK ON HIS CHAIR HALF STUNNED BY DESPAIRING RAGE HE WAS SILENT A FEW MOMENTS NOT LOOKING AT HER
1736-152007-0083 WHILE HER EYES WERE TURNED TOWARD HIM YEARNINGLY IN ALARM AT THIS SUDDEN CHANGE AT LAST HE SAID STILL WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER GO THEN LEAVE ME
1736-152007-0084 BUT HE SHRANK FROM IT AS IF IT HAD BEEN BURNING IRON AND SAID AGAIN LEAVE ME MAGGIE WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF A DECISION AS SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THAT GLOOMY AVERTED FACE AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM
1736-152007-0085 IT WAS LIKE AN AUTOMATIC ACTION THAT FULFILS A FORGOTTEN INTENTION WHAT CAME AFTER A SENSE OF STAIRS DESCENDED AS IF IN A DREAM OF FLAGSTONES OF A CHAISE AND HORSES STANDING THEN A STREET AND A TURNING INTO ANOTHER STREET WHERE A STAGE COACH WAS STANDING
1736-152007-0086 TAKING IN PASSENGERS AND THE DARTING THOUGHT THAT THAT COACH WOULD TAKE HER AWAY PERHAPS TOWARD HOME BUT SHE COULD ASK NOTHING YET SHE ONLY GOT INTO THE COACH HOME WHERE HER MOTHER AND BROTHER WERE PHILIP LUCY THE SCENE OF HER VERY CARES AND TRIALS
1736-152007-0087 WAS THE HAVEN TOWARD WHICH HER MIND TENDED THE SANCTUARY WHERE SACRED RELICS LAY WHERE SHE WOULD BE RESCUED FROM MORE FALLING THE THOUGHT OF STEPHEN WAS LIKE A HORRIBLE THROBBING PAIN WHICH YET AS SUCH PAINS DO SEEMED TO URGE ALL OTHER THOUGHTS INTO ACTIVITY
1736-152007-0088 BUT AMONG HER THOUGHTS WHAT OTHERS WOULD SAY AND THINK OF HER CONDUCT WAS HARDLY PRESENT LOVE AND DEEP PITY AND REMORSEFUL ANGUISH LEFT NO ROOM FOR THAT THE COACH WAS TAKING HER TO YORK FARTHER AWAY FROM HOME
1736-152007-0089 BUT SHE DID NOT LEARN THAT UNTIL SHE WAS SET DOWN IN THE OLD CITY AT MIDNIGHT IT WAS NO MATTER SHE COULD SLEEP THERE AND START HOME THE NEXT DAY SHE HAD HER PURSE IN HER POCKET WITH ALL HER MONEY IN IT A BANK NOTE AND A SOVEREIGN
1736-152007-0090 SHE HAD KEPT IT IN HER POCKET FROM FORGETFULNESS AFTER GOING OUT TO MAKE PURCHASES THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY
1736-152007-0091 WITH HER WILL BENT UNWAVERINGLY ON THE PATH OF PENITENT SACRIFICE THE GREAT STRUGGLES OF LIFE ARE NOT SO EASY AS THAT THE GREAT PROBLEMS OF LIFE ARE NOT SO CLEAR IN THE DARKNESS OF THAT NIGHT SHE SAW STEPHEN'S FACE TURNED TOWARD HER IN PASSIONATE REPROACHFUL MISERY
1736-152007-0092 SHE LIVED THROUGH AGAIN ALL THE TREMULOUS DELIGHTS OF HIS PRESENCE WITH HER THAT MADE EXISTENCE AN EASY FLOATING IN A STREAM OF JOY INSTEAD OF A QUIET RESOLVED ENDURANCE AND EFFORT THE LOVE SHE HAD RENOUNCED CAME BACK UPON HER WITH A CRUEL CHARM
1736-152007-0093 SHE FELT HERSELF OPENING HER ARMS TO RECEIVE IT ONCE MORE AND THEN IT SEEMED TO SLIP AWAY AND FADE AND VANISH LEAVING ONLY THE DYING SOUND OF A DEEP THRILLING VOICE THAT SAID
