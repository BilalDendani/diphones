4236-8927-0000 WERE THE INVENTORS OF AUTOMATIC MACHINES TO BE RANGED ACCORDING TO THE EXCELLENCE OF THEIR DEVICES FOR PRODUCING SOUND ARTISTIC TORTURE
4236-8927-0001 IT SHOULD RATHER HOWEVER BE SAID THE INVENTOR OF THE PARTICULAR FORM OF MAN TRAP OF WHICH THIS FOUND IN THE KEEPER'S OUT HOUSE WAS A SPECIMEN FOR THERE WERE OTHER SHAPES AND OTHER SIZES INSTRUMENTS WHICH IF PLACED IN A ROW BESIDE ONE OF THE TYPE DISINTERRED BY TIM
4236-8927-0002 WOULD HAVE WORN THE SUBORDINATE ASPECT OF THE BEARS WILD BOARS OR WOLVES IN A TRAVELLING MENAGERIE AS COMPARED WITH THE LEADING LION OR TIGER IN SHORT THOUGH MANY VARIETIES HAD BEEN IN USE DURING THOSE CENTURIES WHICH WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO LOOK BACK UPON
4236-8927-0003 AS THE TRUE AND ONLY PERIOD OF MERRY ENGLAND IN THE RURAL DISTRICTS MORE ESPECIALLY AND ONWARD DOWN TO THE THIRD DECADE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THIS MODEL HAD BORNE THE PALM AND HAD BEEN MOST USUALLY FOLLOWED WHEN THE ORCHARDS AND ESTATES REQUIRED NEW ONES
4236-8927-0004 THERE HAD BEEN THE TOOTHLESS VARIETY USED BY THE SOFTER HEARTED LANDLORDS QUITE CONTEMPTIBLE IN THEIR CLEMENCY THE JAWS OF THESE RESEMBLED THE JAWS OF AN OLD WOMAN TO WHOM TIME HAS LEFT NOTHING BUT GUMS THERE WERE ALSO THE INTERMEDIATE OR HALF TOOTHED SORTS
4236-8927-0005 PROBABLY DEVISED BY THE MIDDLE NATURED SQUIRES OR THOSE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THEIR WIVES TWO INCHES OF MERCY TWO INCHES OF CRUELTY TWO INCHES OF MERE NIP TWO INCHES OF PROBE AND SO ON
4236-8927-0006 BUT ONLY CRUSHED THE BONE THE SIGHT OF ONE OF THESE GINS WHEN SET PRODUCED A VIVID IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS ENDOWED WITH LIFE IT EXHIBITED THE COMBINED ASPECTS OF A SHARK A CROCODILE AND A SCORPION EACH TOOTH
4236-8927-0007 WAS IN THE FORM OF A TAPERING SPINE TWO AND A QUARTER INCHES LONG WHICH WHEN THE JAWS WERE CLOSED STOOD IN ALTERNATION FROM THIS SIDE AND FROM THAT WHEN THEY WERE OPEN THE TWO HALVES FORMED A COMPLETE CIRCLE BETWEEN TWO AND THREE FEET IN DIAMETER
4236-8927-0008 THE PLATE OR TREADING PLACE IN THE MIDST BEING ABOUT A FOOT SQUARE WHILE FROM BENEATH EXTENDED IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THE SOUL OF THE APPARATUS THE PAIR OF SPRINGS EACH ONE BEING OF A STIFFNESS TO RENDER NECESSARY A LEVER
4236-8927-0009 OR THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF THE BODY WHEN FORCING IT DOWN THERE WERE MEN AT THIS TIME STILL LIVING AT HINTOCK WHO REMEMBERED WHEN THE GIN AND OTHERS LIKE IT WERE IN USE TIM TANGS'S GREAT UNCLE HAD ENDURED A NIGHT OF SIX HOURS IN THIS VERY TRAP WHICH LAMED HIM FOR LIFE
4236-8927-0010 AND AFTERWARDS COMING BACK THAT WAY FORGETFUL OF WHAT HE HAD DONE WALKED INTO IT HIMSELF THE WOUND BROUGHT ON LOCKJAW OF WHICH HE DIED THIS EVENT OCCURRED DURING THE THIRTIES AND BY THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FORTY
4236-8927-0011 THE USE OF SUCH IMPLEMENTS WAS WELL NIGH DISCONTINUED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
4236-8927-0012 THEY BY NO MEANS DISAPPEARED AND IN ALMOST EVERY VILLAGE ONE COULD BE FOUND IN SOME NOOK OR CORNER AS READILY AS THIS WAS FOUND BY TIM IT HAD INDEED BEEN A FEARFUL AMUSEMENT OF TIM AND OTHER HINTOCK LADS ESPECIALLY
4236-8927-0013 THOSE WHO HAD A DIM SENSE OF BECOMING RENOWNED POACHERS WHEN THEY REACHED THEIR PRIME TO DRAG OUT THIS TRAP FROM ITS HIDING SET IT AND THROW IT WITH BILLETS OF WOOD WHICH WERE PENETRATED BY THE TEETH TO THE DEPTH OF NEAR AN INCH
4236-8927-0014 AS SOON AS HE HAD EXAMINED THE TRAP AND FOUND THAT THE HINGES AND SPRINGS WERE STILL PERFECT HE SHOULDERED IT WITHOUT MORE ADO AND RETURNED WITH HIS BURDEN TO HIS OWN GARDEN PASSING ON THROUGH THE HEDGE TO THE PATH IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARY
4236-8927-0015 HERE BY THE HELP OF A STOUT STAKE HE SET THE TRAP AND LAID IT CAREFULLY BEHIND A BUSH WHILE HE WENT FORWARD TO RECONNOITRE AS HAS BEEN STATED NOBODY PASSED THIS WAY FOR DAYS TOGETHER SOMETIMES BUT THERE WAS JUST A POSSIBILITY
4236-8927-0016 THAT SOME OTHER PEDESTRIAN THAN THE ONE IN REQUEST MIGHT ARRIVE AND IT BEHOOVED TIM TO BE CAREFUL AS TO THE IDENTITY OF HIS VICTIM GOING ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS ALONG THE RISING GROUND TO THE RIGHT HE REACHED A RIDGE WHEREON A LARGE AND THICK HOLLY GREW
4236-8927-0017 BEYOND THIS FOR SOME DISTANCE THE WOOD WAS MORE OPEN AND THE COURSE WHICH FITZPIERS MUST PURSUE TO REACH THE POINT IF HE CAME TO NIGHT WAS VISIBLE A LONG WAY FORWARD FOR SOME TIME THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HIM OR OF ANYBODY
4236-8927-0018 OUT OF THE DIM MID DISTANCE BETWEEN THE MASSES OF BRUSHWOOD ON EITHER HAND AND IT ENLARGED AND TIM COULD HEAR THE BRUSHING OF FEET OVER THE TUFTS OF SOUR GRASS THE AIRY GAIT REVEALED FITZPIERS EVEN BEFORE HIS EXACT OUTLINE COULD BE SEEN
4236-8927-0019 TIM TANGS TURNED ABOUT AND RAN DOWN THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HILL TILL HE WAS AGAIN AT THE HEAD OF HIS OWN GARDEN IT WAS THE WORK OF A FEW MOMENTS TO DRAG OUT THE MAN TRAP VERY GENTLY THAT THE PLATE MIGHT NOT BE DISTURBED SUFFICIENTLY TO THROW IT TO A SPACE BETWEEN A PAIR OF YOUNG OAKS
4236-8927-0020 GREW APART UPWARD FORMING A V SHAPED OPENING BETWEEN AND BEING BACKED UP BY BUSHES LEFT THIS AS THE ONLY COURSE FOR A FOOT PASSENGER IN IT HE LAID THE TRAP WITH THE SAME GENTLENESS OF HANDLING
4236-8927-0021 LOCKED THE CHAIN ROUND ONE OF THE TREES AND FINALLY SLID BACK THE GUARD WHICH WAS PLACED TO KEEP THE GIN FROM ACCIDENTALLY CATCHING THE ARMS OF HIM WHO SET IT OR TO USE THE LOCAL AND BETTER WORD TOILED IT
4236-8927-0022 HAVING COMPLETED THESE ARRANGEMENTS TIM SPRANG THROUGH THE ADJOINING HEDGE OF HIS FATHER'S GARDEN RAN DOWN THE PATH AND SOFTLY ENTERED THE HOUSE OBEDIENT TO HIS ORDER SUKE HAD GONE TO BED AND AS SOON AS HE HAD BOLTED THE DOOR
4236-8927-0023 HIS OBJECT SEEMED TO BE TO UNDRESS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BEFORE HOWEVER HE HAD COMPLETED THE OPERATION A LONG CRY RESOUNDED WITHOUT PENETRATING BUT INDESCRIBABLE WHAT'S THAT
4236-8927-0024 SAID SUKE STARTING UP IN BED SOUNDS AS IF SOMEBODY HAD CAUGHT A HARE IN HIS GIN
4236-8927-0025 HOW BE YOU GOING TO WAKE AT HALF PAST THREE ELSE
4236-8927-0026 TIM STEALTHILY OPENED THE WINDOW AND LISTENED ABOVE THE LOW HARMONIES PRODUCED BY THE INSTRUMENTATION OF THE VARIOUS SPECIES OF TREES AROUND THE PREMISES HE COULD HEAR THE TWITCHING OF A CHAIN FROM THE SPOT WHEREON HE HAD SET THE MAN TRAP
4236-8927-0027 BUT FURTHER HUMAN SOUND THERE WAS NONE TIM WAS PUZZLED
4236-8927-0028 BUT IF ONE WHY NOT MORE HE SOON CEASED TO ESSAY AN ANSWER FOR HINTOCK WAS DEAD TO HIM ALREADY IN HALF A DOZEN HOURS HE WOULD BE OUT OF ITS PRECINCTS FOR LIFE ON HIS WAY TO THE ANTIPODES
4236-8927-0029 THERE WAS NO GETTING OVER THAT AND OUGHT SHE ANY LONGER TO KEEP HIM AT A DISTANCE HIS SUAVE DEFERENCE TO HER LIGHTEST WHIM ON THE QUESTION OF HIS COMINGS AND GOINGS WHEN AS HER LAWFUL HUSBAND HE MIGHT SHOW A LITTLE INDEPENDENCE
4236-8927-0030 WAS A TRAIT IN HIS CHARACTER AS UNEXPECTED AS IT WAS ENGAGING IF SHE HAD BEEN HIS EMPRESS AND HE HER THRALL HE COULD NOT HAVE EXHIBITED A MORE SENSITIVE CARE TO AVOID INTRUDING UPON HER AGAINST HER WILL
4236-8927-0031 READING IT SLOWLY THROUGH SHE BECAME QUITE APPALLED AT HER RECENT OFF HANDEDNESS WHEN SHE REDISCOVERED WHAT AWFULLY SOLEMN PROMISES SHE HAD MADE HIM AT THOSE
4236-8927-0032 NOT SO VERY LONG AGO SHE BECAME LOST IN LONG PONDERINGS
4236-8927-0033 MIGHT BE BOUND BY VOWS MADE WITHOUT AT THE TIME A FULL RECOGNITION OF THEIR FORCE THAT PARTICULAR SENTENCE BEGINNING WHOM GOD HATH JOINED TOGETHER WAS A STAGGERER FOR A GENTLEWOMAN OF STRONG DEVOTIONAL SENTIMENT
4236-8927-0034 SHE WONDERED WHETHER GOD REALLY DID JOIN THEM TOGETHER BEFORE SHE HAD DONE DELIBERATING THE TIME OF HER ENGAGEMENT DREW NEAR AND SHE WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE ALMOST AT THE MOMENT THAT TIM TANGS RETIRED TO HIS OWN
4236-8927-0035 THE POSITION OF THINGS AT THAT CRITICAL JUNCTURE WAS BRIEFLY AS FOLLOWS
4236-8927-0036 OF THE UPPER END OF TANGS'S GARDEN FITZPIERS WAS STILL ADVANCING HAVING NOW NEARLY REACHED THE SUMMIT OF THE WOOD CLOTHED RIDGE THE PATH BEING THE ACTUAL ONE WHICH FURTHER ON PASSED BETWEEN THE TWO YOUNG OAKS
4236-8927-0037 WAS ARISING A CONDITION WHICH HE HAD NOT DIVINED THE EMERGENCE OF GRACE AS AFORESAID FROM THE UPPER CORNER OF HER FATHER'S GARDEN WITH THE VIEW OF MEETING TIM'S INTENDED VICTIM MIDWAY BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE WAS THE DIABOLICAL TRAP SILENT
4236-8927-0038 OPEN READY
4236-8927-0039 THE VERY RESTRAINT THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO EXERCISE UPON HIMSELF SO AS NOT TO KILL THE DELICATE BUD OF RETURNING CONFIDENCE FED HIS FLAME HE WALKED SO MUCH MORE RAPIDLY THAN GRACE THAT IF THEY CONTINUED ADVANCING AS THEY HAD BEGUN
4236-8927-0040 HE WOULD REACH THE TRAP A GOOD HALF MINUTE BEFORE SHE COULD REACH THE SAME SPOT BUT HERE A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE CAME IN TO ESCAPE THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF BEING WATCHED OR LISTENED TO BY LURKERS NATURALLY CURIOUS BY REASON OF THEIR STRAINED RELATIONS THEY HAD ARRANGED
4236-8927-0041 THAT THEIR MEETING FOR TO NIGHT SHOULD BE AT THE HOLM TREE ON THE RIDGE ABOVE NAMED SO SOON ACCORDINGLY
4236-8927-0042 HE STOOD STILL TO AWAIT HER HE HAD NOT PAUSED UNDER THE PRICKLY FOLIAGE MORE THAN TWO MINUTES WHEN HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A SCREAM FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIDGE FITZPIERS WONDERED WHAT IT COULD MEAN BUT SUCH WIND AS THERE WAS JUST NOW BLEW IN AN ADVERSE DIRECTION
4236-8927-0043 AND HIS MOOD WAS LIGHT HE SET DOWN THE ORIGIN OF THE SOUND TO ONE OF THE SUPERSTITIOUS FREAKS OR FROLICSOME SCRIMMAGES BETWEEN SWEETHEARTS THAT STILL SURVIVED IN HINTOCK FROM OLD ENGLISH TIMES AND WAITED ON WHERE HE STOOD TILL TEN MINUTES HAD PASSED
4236-8927-0044 FEELING THEN A LITTLE UNEASY HIS MIND REVERTED TO THE SCREAM AND HE WENT FORWARD OVER THE SUMMIT AND DOWN THE EMBOWERED INCLINE
4236-8927-0045 FITZPIERS STUMBLED AND ALL BUT FELL STRETCHING DOWN HIS HAND TO ASCERTAIN THE OBSTRUCTION
4236-8927-0046 AND IRON WORK THAT CONVEYED ABSOLUTELY NO EXPLANATORY IDEA TO HIS MIND AT ALL IT WAS BUT THE WORK OF A MOMENT TO STRIKE A MATCH AND THEN HE SAW A SIGHT WHICH CONGEALED HIS BLOOD THE MAN TRAP WAS THROWN
4236-8927-0047 AND BETWEEN ITS JAWS WAS PART OF A WOMAN'S CLOTHING A PATTERNED SILK SKIRT
4236-8927-0048 SKEWERING ITS TISSUE IN A SCORE OF PLACES HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THE SKIRT AS THAT OF ONE OF HIS WIFE'S GOWNS THE GOWN THAT SHE HAD WORN WHEN SHE MET HIM ON THE VERY LAST OCCASION
4236-8927-0049 FITZPIERS HAD OFTEN STUDIED THE EFFECT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS WHEN EXAMINING THE COLLECTION AT HINTOCK HOUSE AND THE CONCEPTION INSTANTLY FLASHED THROUGH HIM THAT GRACE HAD BEEN CAUGHT TAKEN OUT MANGLED BY SOME CHANCE PASSER AND CARRIED HOME
4236-8927-0050 SOME OF HER CLOTHES BEING LEFT BEHIND IN THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING HER FREE THE SHOCK OF THIS CONVICTION
4236-8927-0051 WAS SO GREAT THAT HE CRIED OUT LIKE ONE IN CORPORAL AGONY AND IN HIS MISERY
4236-8927-0052 OF ALL THE DEGREES AND QUALITIES OF PUNISHMENT THAT FITZPIERS HAD UNDERGONE SINCE HIS SINS AGAINST GRACE FIRST BEGAN NOT ANY EVEN APPROXIMATED IN INTENSITY TO THIS OH MY OWN MY DARLING OH CRUEL HEAVEN IT IS TOO MUCH THIS
4236-8927-0053 HE CRIED WRITHING AND ROCKING HIMSELF OVER THE SORRY ACCESSARIES OF HER HE DEPLORED THE VOICE OF HIS DISTRESS WAS SUFFICIENTLY LOUD TO BE AUDIBLE TO ANY ONE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN THERE TO HEAR IT
4236-8927-0054 RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE NARROW PASS BETWEEN THE OAKS WERE DENSE BUSHES AND NOW FROM BEHIND THESE A FEMALE FIGURE GLIDED WHOSE APPEARANCE EVEN IN THE GLOOM WAS THOUGH GRACEFUL IN OUTLINE NOTICEABLY STRANGE
4236-8927-0055 SHE WAS IN WHITE UP TO THE WAIST AND FIGURED ABOVE SHE WAS IN SHORT GRACE HIS WIFE LACKING THE PORTION OF HER DRESS WHICH THE GIN RETAINED DON'T BE GRIEVED ABOUT ME DON'T DEAR EDGAR SHE EXCLAIMED RUSHING UP AND BENDING OVER HIM I AM NOT HURT A BIT
4236-8927-0056 I WAS COMING ON TO FIND YOU AFTER I HAD RELEASED MYSELF BUT I HEARD FOOTSTEPS AND I HID AWAY
4236-8927-0057 AND I DID NOT KNOW WHO THE PERSON MIGHT BE FITZPIERS HAD SPRUNG TO HIS FEET AND HIS NEXT ACT WAS NO LESS UNPREMEDITATED BY HIM THAN IT WAS IRRESISTIBLE BY HER AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SO BY ANY WOMAN NOT OF AMAZONIAN STRENGTH
4236-8927-0058 YOU ARE NOT DEAD YOU ARE NOT HURT THANK GOD THANK GOD HE SAID ALMOST SOBBING IN HIS DELIGHT AND RELIEF FROM THE HORROR OF HIS APPREHENSION GRACE MY WIFE MY LOVE HOW IS THIS WHAT HAS HAPPENED I WAS COMING ON TO YOU SHE SAID
4236-8927-0059 I WAS TRYING TO BE AS PUNCTUAL AS POSSIBLE
4236-8927-0060 FORTUNATELY FOR MYSELF JUST WHEN I HAD PASSED BETWEEN THESE TREES I FELT SOMETHING CLUTCH AT MY DRESS FROM BEHIND WITH A NOISE AND THE NEXT MOMENT I WAS PULLED BACKWARD BY IT AND FELL TO THE GROUND I SCREAMED WITH TERROR THINKING IT WAS A MAN LYING DOWN THERE TO MURDER ME
4236-8927-0061 BUT THE NEXT MOMENT I DISCOVERED IT WAS IRON AND THAT MY CLOTHES WERE CAUGHT IN A TRAP I PULLED THIS WAY AND THAT BUT THE THING WOULD NOT LET GO
4236-8927-0062 AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO I DID NOT WANT TO ALARM MY FATHER OR ANYBODY AS I WISHED NOBODY TO KNOW OF THESE MEETINGS WITH YOU SO I COULD THINK OF NO OTHER PLAN THAN SLIPPING OFF MY SKIRT
4236-8927-0063 BUT WHEN I HAD JUST FREED MYSELF BY LEAVING THE DRESS BEHIND I HEARD STEPS AND NOT BEING SURE IT WAS YOU I DID NOT LIKE TO BE SEEN IN SUCH A PICKLE SO I HID AWAY
4236-8927-0064 OR YOURS IF YOU HAD GOT HERE FIRST SAID SHE BEGINNING TO REALIZE THE WHOLE GHASTLINESS OF THE POSSIBILITY OH EDGAR
4236-8927-0065 AND WE SHOULD BE THANKFUL INDEED HE CONTINUED TO PRESS HIS FACE TO HERS YOU ARE MINE MINE AGAIN NOW SHE GENTLY OWNED THAT SHE SUPPOSED SHE WAS I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID WHEN YOU THOUGHT I WAS INJURED SHE WENT ON SHYLY
4236-8927-0066 AND I KNOW THAT A MAN WHO COULD SUFFER AS YOU WERE SUFFERING MUST HAVE A TENDER REGARD FOR ME BUT HOW DOES THIS AWFUL THING COME HERE
4236-8927-0067 AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL GRACE SAID IF I COULD ONLY GET MY SKIRT OUT NOBODY WOULD KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT THAT HE BESTIRRED HIMSELF
4236-8927-0068 ACROSS THE JAWS A BILLET WHICH THEY DRAGGED FROM A FAGGOT NEAR AT HAND AND IT WAS THEN POSSIBLE TO EXTRACT THE SILK MOUTHFUL FROM THE MONSTER'S BITE CREASED AND PIERCED WITH MANY HOLES BUT NOT TORN FITZPIERS ASSISTED HER TO PUT IT ON AGAIN
4236-8927-0069 AND WHEN HER CUSTOMARY CONTOURS WERE THUS RESTORED THEY WALKED ON TOGETHER GRACE TAKING HIS ARM
4236-8927-0070 SHE MADE NO FURTHER ATTEMPT AT RESERVE I WOULD ASK YOU TO COME INTO THE HOUSE SHE SAID BUT MY MEETINGS WITH YOU
4236-8927-0071 AND I SHOULD LIKE TO PREPARE HIM NEVER MIND DEAREST I COULD NOT VERY WELL HAVE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION I SHALL NEVER LIVE HERE AGAIN AS MUCH FOR YOUR SAKE AS FOR MINE I HAVE NEWS TO TELL YOU ON THIS VERY POINT BUT MY ALARM HAD PUT IT OUT OF MY HEAD
4236-8927-0072 I HAVE BOUGHT A PRACTICE OR RATHER A PARTNERSHIP
4236-8927-0073 MY POOR OLD GREAT AUNT DIED ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS AGO AND LEFT ME ENOUGH TO DO THIS I HAVE TAKEN A LITTLE FURNISHED HOUSE FOR A TIME TILL WE CAN GET ONE OF OUR OWN HE DESCRIBED THE PLACE AND THE SURROUNDINGS AND THE VIEW FROM THE WINDOWS AND GRACE BECAME MUCH INTERESTED
4236-8927-0074 BUT WHY ARE YOU NOT THERE NOW SHE SAID BECAUSE I CANNOT TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM HERE TILL I HAVE YOUR PROMISE NOW DARLING YOU WILL ACCOMPANY ME THERE WILL YOU NOT TO NIGHT HAS SETTLED THAT GRACE'S TREMBLINGS
4236-8927-0075 HAD GONE OFF AND SHE DID NOT SAY NAY THEY WENT ON TOGETHER
4236-8927-0076 TILL SHE NOTICED THEY WERE IN AN ENCIRCLED GLADE IN THE DENSEST PART OF THE WOOD
4236-8927-0077 SHONE ALMOST VERTICALLY IT WAS AN EXCEPTIONALLY SOFT BALMY EVENING FOR THE TIME OF YEAR WHICH WAS JUST THAT TRANSIENT PERIOD IN THE MAY MONTH WHEN BEECH TREES HAVE SUDDENLY UNFOLDED LARGE LIMP YOUNG LEAVES
4236-8927-0078 BOUGHS BEARING SUCH LEAVES HUNG LOW AROUND AND COMPLETELY ENCLOSED THEM SO THAT IT WAS AS IF THEY WERE IN A GREAT GREEN VASE WHICH HAD MOSS FOR ITS BOTTOM AND LEAF SIDES THE CLOUDS HAVING BEEN PACKED IN THE WEST THAT EVENING
4236-8927-0079 SO AS TO RETAIN THE DEPARTING GLARE A LONG WHILE THE HOUR HAD SEEMED MUCH EARLIER THAN IT WAS BUT SUDDENLY THE QUESTION OF TIME OCCURRED TO HER
4236-8927-0080 AS THEY WALKED HE EXAMINED HIS WATCH BY THE AID OF THE NOW STRONG MOONLIGHT BY THE GODS I THINK I HAVE LOST MY TRAIN SAID FITZPIERS
4236-8927-0081 THEN DO YOU HASTEN ON EDGAR I AM NOT IN THE LEAST AFRAID I RECOGNIZE NOW THE PART OF THE WOOD WE ARE IN AND I CAN FIND MY WAY BACK QUITE EASILY I'LL TELL MY FATHER THAT WE HAVE MADE IT UP I WISH I HAD NOT KEPT OUR MEETINGS SO PRIVATE
4236-8927-0082 HE IS GETTING OLD AND IRRITABLE THAT WAS WHY I DID NOT GOOD BY BUT AS I MUST STAY AT THE EARL OF WESSEX TO NIGHT FOR I CANNOT POSSIBLY CATCH THE TRAIN I THINK IT WOULD BE SAFER FOR YOU TO LET ME TAKE CARE OF YOU
