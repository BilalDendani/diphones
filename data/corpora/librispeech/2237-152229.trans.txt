2237-152229-0000 CHAPTER NINE THE STRAIGHT SIMPLICITY OF EVE FOR THE NEXT THREE WEEKS ERIC MARSHALL SEEMED TO HIMSELF TO BE LIVING TWO LIVES AS DISTINCT FROM EACH OTHER AS IF HE POSSESSED A DOUBLE PERSONALITY IN ONE
2237-152229-0001 HE TAUGHT THE LINDSAY DISTRICT SCHOOL DILIGENTLY AND PAINSTAKINGLY SOLVED PROBLEMS ARGUED ON THEOLOGY WITH ROBERT WILLIAMSON CALLED AT THE HOMES OF HIS PUPILS AND TOOK TEA IN STATE WITH THEIR PARENTS WENT TO A RUSTIC DANCE OR TWO AND PLAYED HAVOC ALL UNWITTINGLY WITH THE HEARTS OF THE LINDSAY MAIDENS
2237-152229-0002 BUT THIS LIFE WAS A DREAM OF WORKADAY HE ONLY LIVED IN THE OTHER WHICH WAS SPENT IN AN OLD ORCHARD GRASSY AND OVERGROWN WHERE THE MINUTES SEEMED TO LAG FOR SHEER LOVE OF THE SPOT AND THE JUNE WINDS MADE WILD HARPING IN THE OLD SPRUCES
2237-152229-0003 HERE EVERY EVENING HE MET KILMENY IN THAT OLD ORCHARD THEY GARNERED HOURS OF QUIET HAPPINESS TOGETHER TOGETHER THEY WENT WANDERING IN THE FAIR FIELDS OF OLD ROMANCE TOGETHER THEY READ MANY BOOKS AND TALKED OF MANY THINGS
2237-152229-0004 KILMENY PLAYED TO HIM AND THE OLD ORCHARD ECHOED WITH HER LOVELY FANTASTIC MELODIES AT EVERY MEETING HER BEAUTY CAME HOME AFRESH TO HIM WITH THE OLD THRILL OF GLAD SURPRISE IN THE INTERVALS OF ABSENCE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE AS BEAUTIFUL AS HE REMEMBERED HER
2237-152229-0005 AND THEN WHEN THEY MET SHE SEEMED EVEN MORE SO HE LEARNED TO WATCH FOR THE UNDISGUISED LIGHT OF WELCOME THAT ALWAYS LEAPED INTO HER EYES AT THE SOUND OF HIS FOOTSTEPS SHE WAS NEARLY ALWAYS THERE BEFORE HIM AND SHE ALWAYS SHOWED THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE HIM WITH THE FRANK DELIGHT OF A CHILD WATCHING FOR A DEAR COMRADE
2237-152229-0006 SHE WAS NEVER IN THE SAME MOOD TWICE NOW SHE WAS GRAVE NOW GAY NOW STATELY NOW PENSIVE BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS CHARMING THRAWN AND TWISTED THE OLD GORDON STOCK MIGHT BE BUT IT HAD AT LEAST THIS ONE OFFSHOOT OF PERFECT GRACE AND SYMMETRY
2237-152229-0007 HER MIND AND HEART UTTERLY UNSPOILED OF THE WORLD WERE AS BEAUTIFUL AS HER FACE ALL THE UGLINESS OF EXISTENCE HAD PASSED HER BY SHRINED IN HER DOUBLE SOLITUDE OF UPBRINGING AND MUTENESS SHE WAS NATURALLY QUICK AND CLEVER
2237-152229-0008 DELIGHTFUL LITTLE FLASHES OF WIT AND HUMOUR SPARKLED OUT OCCASIONALLY SHE COULD BE WHIMSICAL EVEN CHARMINGLY CAPRICIOUS SOMETIMES INNOCENT MISCHIEF GLIMMERED OUT IN THE UNFATHOMABLE DEEPS OF HER BLUE EYES SARCASM EVEN WAS NOT UNKNOWN TO HER
2237-152229-0009 NOW AND THEN SHE PUNCTURED SOME HARMLESS BUBBLE OF A YOUNG MAN'S CONCEIT OR MASCULINE SUPERIORITY WITH A BITING LITTLE LINE OF DAINTILY WRITTEN SCRIPT SHE ASSIMILATED THE IDEAS IN THE BOOKS THEY READ SPEEDILY EAGERLY AND THOROUGHLY
2237-152229-0010 ALWAYS SEIZING ON THE BEST AND TRUEST AND REJECTING THE FALSE AND SPURIOUS AND WEAK WITH AN UNFAILING INTUITION AT WHICH ERIC MARVELLED HERS WAS THE SPEAR OF ITHURIEL TRYING OUT THE DROSS OF EVERYTHING AND LEAVING ONLY THE PURE GOLD
2237-152229-0011 IN MANNER AND OUTLOOK SHE WAS STILL A CHILD YET NOW AND AGAIN SHE WAS AS OLD AS EVE AN EXPRESSION WOULD LEAP INTO HER LAUGHING FACE A SUBTLE MEANING REVEAL ITSELF IN HER SMILE THAT HELD ALL THE LORE OF WOMANHOOD AND ALL THE WISDOM OF THE AGES
2237-152229-0012 HER WAY OF SMILING ENCHANTED HIM THE SMILE ALWAYS BEGAN FAR DOWN IN HER EYES AND FLOWED OUTWARD TO HER FACE LIKE A SPARKLING BROOK STEALING OUT OF SHADOW INTO SUNSHINE HE KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT HER LIFE SHE TOLD HIM HER SIMPLE HISTORY FREELY
2237-152229-0013 SHE RARELY SPOKE OF HER MOTHER ERIC CAME SOMEHOW TO UNDERSTAND LESS FROM WHAT SHE SAID THAN FROM WHAT SHE DID NOT SAY THAT KILMENY THOUGH SHE HAD LOVED HER MOTHER HAD ALWAYS BEEN RATHER AFRAID OF HER THERE HAD NOT BEEN BETWEEN THEM THE NATURAL BEAUTIFUL CONFIDENCE OF MOTHER AND CHILD
2237-152229-0014 OF NEIL SHE WROTE FREQUENTLY AT FIRST AND SEEMED VERY FOND OF HIM LATER SHE CEASED TO MENTION HIM PERHAPS FOR SHE WAS MARVELLOUSLY QUICK TO CATCH AND INTERPRET EVERY FLEETING CHANGE OF EXPRESSION IN HIS VOICE AND FACE SHE DISCERNED WHAT ERIC DID NOT KNOW HIMSELF
2237-152229-0015 THAT HIS EYES CLOUDED AND GREW MOODY AT THE MENTION OF NEIL'S NAME ONCE SHE ASKED HIM NAIVELY ARE THERE MANY PEOPLE LIKE YOU OUT IN THE WORLD THOUSANDS OF THEM SAID ERIC LAUGHING SHE LOOKED GRAVELY AT HIM THEN SHE GAVE HER HEAD A QUICK DECIDED LITTLE SHAKE
2237-152229-0016 I DO NOT THINK SO SHE WROTE I DO NOT KNOW MUCH OF THE WORLD BUT I DO NOT THINK THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE LIKE YOU IN IT ONE EVENING WHEN THE FAR AWAY HILLS AND FIELDS WERE SCARFED IN GAUZY PURPLES AND THE INTERVALES WERE BRIMMING WITH GOLDEN MISTS
2237-152229-0017 ERIC CARRIED TO THE OLD ORCHARD A LITTLE LIMP WORN VOLUME THAT HELD A LOVE STORY IT WAS THE FIRST THING OF THE KIND HE HAD EVER READ TO HER FOR IN THE FIRST NOVEL HE HAD LENT HER THE LOVE INTEREST HAD BEEN VERY SLIGHT AND SUBORDINATE
2237-152229-0018 THIS WAS A BEAUTIFUL PASSIONATE IDYL EXQUISITELY TOLD HE READ IT TO HER LYING IN THE GRASS AT HER FEET SHE LISTENED WITH HER HANDS CLASPED OVER HER KNEE AND HER EYES CAST DOWN IT WAS NOT A LONG STORY
2237-152229-0019 AND WHEN HE HAD FINISHED IT HE SHUT THE BOOK AND LOOKED UP AT HER QUESTIONINGLY DO YOU LIKE IT KILMENY HE ASKED VERY SLOWLY SHE TOOK HER SLATE AND WROTE YES I LIKE IT BUT IT HURT ME TOO I DID NOT KNOW THAT A PERSON COULD LIKE ANYTHING THAT HURT HER
2237-152229-0020 I DO NOT KNOW WHY IT HURT ME I FELT AS IF I HAD LOST SOMETHING THAT I NEVER HAD THAT WAS A VERY SILLY FEELING WAS IT NOT BUT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE BOOK VERY WELL YOU SEE IT IS ABOUT LOVE AND I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT LOVE
2237-152229-0021 MOTHER TOLD ME ONCE THAT LOVE IS A CURSE AND THAT I MUST PRAY THAT IT WOULD NEVER ENTER INTO MY LIFE SHE SAID IT VERY EARNESTLY AND SO I BELIEVED HER BUT YOUR BOOK TEACHES THAT IT IS A BLESSING IT SAYS THAT IT IS THE MOST SPLENDID AND WONDERFUL THING IN LIFE WHICH AM I TO BELIEVE
2237-152229-0022 LOVE REAL LOVE IS NEVER A CURSE KILMENY SAID ERIC GRAVELY THERE IS A FALSE LOVE WHICH IS A CURSE PERHAPS YOUR MOTHER BELIEVED IT WAS THAT WHICH HAD ENTERED HER LIFE AND RUINED IT AND SO SHE MADE THE MISTAKE THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD
2237-152229-0023 OR IN HEAVEN EITHER AS I BELIEVE SO TRULY BEAUTIFUL AND WONDERFUL AND BLESSED AS LOVE HAVE YOU EVER LOVED ASKED KILMENY WITH THE DIRECTNESS OF PHRASING NECESSITATED BY HER MODE OF COMMUNICATION WHICH WAS SOMETIMES A LITTLE TERRIBLE
2237-152229-0024 NO SAID ERIC HONESTLY AS HE THOUGHT BUT EVERY ONE HAS AN IDEAL OF LOVE WHOM HE HOPES TO MEET SOME DAY
2237-152229-0025 I SUPPOSE I HAVE MINE IN SOME SEALED SECRET CHAMBER OF MY HEART I SUPPOSE YOUR IDEAL WOMAN WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL LIKE THE WOMAN IN YOUR BOOK OH YES I AM SURE I COULD NEVER CARE FOR AN UGLY WOMAN SAID ERIC LAUGHING A LITTLE AS HE SAT UP

2237-152229-0034 NOBODY WILL EVER LOVE ME I AM TOO UGLY YOU UGLY EXCLAIMED ERIC HE WAS ON THE POINT OF GOING OFF INTO A PEAL OF LAUGHTER AT THE IDEA WHEN A GLIMPSE OF HER HALF AVERTED FACE SOBERED HIM
2237-152229-0035 ON IT WAS A HURT BITTER LOOK SUCH AS HE REMEMBERED SEEING ONCE BEFORE WHEN HE HAD ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE THE WORLD FOR HERSELF KILMENY HE SAID IN ASTONISHMENT YOU DON'T REALLY THINK YOURSELF UGLY DO YOU SHE NODDED WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIM AND THEN WROTE
2237-152229-0036 OH YES I KNOW THAT I AM I HAVE KNOWN IT FOR A LONG TIME MOTHER TOLD ME THAT I WAS VERY UGLY AND THAT NOBODY WOULD EVER LIKE TO LOOK AT ME I AM SORRY IT HURTS ME MUCH WORSE TO KNOW I AM UGLY THAN IT DOES TO KNOW I CANNOT SPEAK
2237-152229-0037 I SUPPOSE YOU WILL THINK THAT IS VERY FOOLISH OF ME BUT IT IS TRUE THAT WAS WHY I DID NOT COME BACK TO THE ORCHARD FOR SUCH A LONG TIME EVEN AFTER I HAD GOT OVER MY FRIGHT I HATED TO THINK THAT YOU WOULD THINK ME UGLY AND THAT IS WHY I DO NOT WANT TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND MEET PEOPLE
2237-152229-0038 HE STARED AT ME SO I KNEW IT WAS BECAUSE HE THOUGHT ME SO UGLY AND I HAVE ALWAYS HIDDEN WHEN HE CAME EVER SINCE ERIC'S LIPS TWITCHED IN SPITE OF HIS PITY FOR THE REAL SUFFERING DISPLAYED IN HER EYES
2237-152229-0039 HE COULD NOT HELP FEELING AMUSED OVER THE ABSURD IDEA OF THIS BEAUTIFUL GIRL BELIEVING HERSELF IN ALL SERIOUSNESS TO BE UGLY BUT KILMENY DO YOU THINK YOURSELF UGLY WHEN YOU LOOK IN A MIRROR HE ASKED SMILING
2237-152229-0040 I NEVER KNEW THERE WAS SUCH A THING UNTIL AFTER MOTHER DIED AND I READ ABOUT IT IN A BOOK THEN I ASKED AUNT JANET AND SHE SAID MOTHER HAD BROKEN ALL THE LOOKING GLASSES IN THE HOUSE WHEN I WAS A BABY BUT I HAVE SEEN MY FACE REFLECTED IN THE SPOONS AND IN A LITTLE SILVER SUGAR BOWL AUNT JANET HAS
2237-152229-0041 AND IT IS UGLY VERY UGLY ERIC'S FACE WENT DOWN INTO THE GRASS FOR HIS LIFE HE COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AND FOR HIS LIFE HE WOULD NOT LET KILMENY SEE HIM LAUGHING
2237-152229-0042 A CERTAIN LITTLE WHIMSICAL WISH TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM AND HE DID NOT HASTEN TO TELL HER THE TRUTH AS HAD BEEN HIS FIRST IMPULSE INSTEAD WHEN HE DARED TO LOOK UP HE SAID SLOWLY I DON'T THINK YOU ARE UGLY KILMENY OH BUT I AM SURE YOU MUST SHE WROTE PROTESTINGLY
2237-152229-0043 EVEN NEIL DOES HE TELLS ME I AM KIND AND NICE BUT ONE DAY I ASKED HIM IF HE THOUGHT ME VERY UGLY AND HE LOOKED AWAY AND WOULD NOT SPEAK SO I KNEW WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT TOO DO NOT LET US SPEAK OF THIS AGAIN IT MAKES ME FEEL SORRY AND SPOILS EVERYTHING

2237-152229-0046 BUT THERE WAS IN HIS VOICE A TENDER NOTE OF WHICH HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS KILMENY WAS AWARE OF IT HOWEVER AND SHE PICKED UP HER VIOLIN WITH A PLEASED SMILE
2237-152229-0047 HE LEFT HER PLAYING THERE AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE DIM RESINOUS SPRUCE WOOD HER MUSIC FOLLOWED HIM LIKE AN INVISIBLE GUARDIAN SPIRIT KILMENY THE BEAUTIFUL HE MURMURED AND YET GOOD HEAVENS THE CHILD THINKS SHE IS UGLY
2237-152229-0048 SHE WITH A FACE MORE LOVELY THAN EVER AN ARTIST DREAMED OF A GIRL OF EIGHTEEN WHO HAS NEVER LOOKED IN A MIRROR I WONDER IF THERE IS ANOTHER SUCH IN ANY CIVILIZED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
2237-152229-0049 I WONDER IF MARGARET GORDON COULD HAVE BEEN QUITE SANE
2237-152229-0050 PERHAPS HE DOESN'T WANT HER TO FIND OUT ERIC HAD MET NEIL GORDON A FEW EVENINGS BEFORE THIS AT A COUNTRY DANCE WHERE NEIL HAD PLAYED THE VIOLIN FOR THE DANCERS INFLUENCED BY CURIOSITY HE HAD SOUGHT THE LAD'S ACQUAINTANCE NEIL WAS FRIENDLY AND TALKATIVE AT FIRST
2237-152229-0051 HIS FACE AND MANNER CHANGED HE LOOKED SECRETIVE AND SUSPICIOUS ALMOST SINISTER A SULLEN LOOK CREPT INTO HIS BIG BLACK EYES AND HE DREW HIS BOW ACROSS THE VIOLIN STRINGS WITH A DISCORDANT SCREECH AS IF TO TERMINATE THE CONVERSATION
