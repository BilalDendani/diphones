6248-91255-0017 FIRST TIME WITH SOME SHERRY AND THE SECOND TIME WAS ABOUT AN HOUR AFTERWARDS WHEN THE GENTLEMEN HAD FINISHED DINNER I TOOK UP A BOTTLE OF SOME OLD BRANDY THAT THE INN USED TO BE FAMOUS FOR IT'S THE SAME THAT YOU GENTLEMEN HAVE BEEN DRINKING
6248-91255-0018 WHEN I KNOCKED AT THE DOOR WITH THE BRANDY IT WAS MISTER GLENTHORPE WHO CALLED COME IN HE WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF THE FIRE WITH A FOSSIL IN HIS HAND AND HE WAS TELLING THE YOUNG MAN ABOUT HOW HE CAME TO DISCOVER IT

6248-91255-0021 BUT NOT TO BOTHER IF THEY WERE STILL SITTING UP IT HAD BEEN DECIDED THAT THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN SHOULD OCCUPY THE BEDROOM NEXT TO MISTER GLENTHORPE AND ANN WAS A BIT LATE WITH HER ORDINARY WORK BECAUSE IT HAD TAKEN HER SOME TIME TO GET HIS ROOM READY
