252-29350-0000 BY DISPROVING THAT LAW IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO RETAIN THE OLD CONCEPTION OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE BODIES BUT WITHOUT DISPROVING IT IT WOULD SEEM IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTINUE STUDYING THE PTOLEMAIC WORLDS
252-29350-0001 BUT EVEN AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE LAW OF COPERNICUS
252-29350-0002 FROM THE TIME THE FIRST PERSON SAID AND PROVED THAT THE NUMBER OF BIRTHS OR OF CRIMES
252-29350-0003 IS DETERMINED BY CERTAIN GEOGRAPHICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THAT CERTAIN RELATIONS OF POPULATION TO SOIL PRODUCE MIGRATIONS OF PEOPLES THE FOUNDATIONS ON WHICH HISTORY HAD BEEN BUILT WERE DESTROYED IN THEIR ESSENCE
252-29350-0004 BY REFUTING THESE NEW LAWS THE FORMER VIEW OF HISTORY MIGHT HAVE BEEN RETAINED BUT WITHOUT REFUTING THEM IT WOULD SEEM IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTINUE STUDYING HISTORIC EVENTS AS THE RESULTS OF MAN'S FREE WILL
252-29350-0005 FOR IF A CERTAIN MODE OF GOVERNMENT WAS ESTABLISHED OR CERTAIN MIGRATIONS OF PEOPLES TOOK PLACE IN CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH AND SUCH GEOGRAPHIC ETHNOGRAPHIC OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
252-29350-0006 THEN THE FREE WILL OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO APPEAR TO US TO HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT MODE OF GOVERNMENT OR OCCASIONED THE MIGRATIONS CAN NO LONGER BE REGARDED AS THE CAUSE AND YET THE FORMER HISTORY CONTINUES TO BE STUDIED
252-29350-0007 SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE LAWS OF STATISTICS GEOGRAPHY POLITICAL ECONOMY COMPARATIVE PHILOLOGY AND GEOLOGY WHICH DIRECTLY CONTRADICT ITS ASSUMPTIONS THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE OLD VIEWS AND THE NEW
252-29350-0008 WAS LONG AND STUBBORNLY FOUGHT OUT IN PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY THEOLOGY STOOD ON GUARD FOR THE OLD VIEWS AND ACCUSED THE NEW OF VIOLATING REVELATION BUT WHEN TRUTH CONQUERED THEOLOGY ESTABLISHED ITSELF JUST AS FIRMLY ON THE NEW FOUNDATION
252-29350-0009 JUST AS PROLONGED AND STUBBORN IS THE STRUGGLE NOW PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE NEW CONCEPTION OF HISTORY AND THEOLOGY IN THE SAME WAY STANDS ON GUARD FOR THE OLD VIEW AND ACCUSES THE NEW VIEW OF SUBVERTING REVELATION
252-29350-0010 IN THE ONE CASE AS IN THE OTHER ON BOTH SIDES THE STRUGGLE PROVOKES PASSION AND STIFLES TRUTH ON THE ONE HAND THERE IS FEAR AND REGRET FOR THE LOSS OF THE WHOLE EDIFICE CONSTRUCTED THROUGH THE AGES
252-29350-0011 ON THE OTHER IS THE PASSION FOR DESTRUCTION TO THE MEN WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE RISING TRUTHS OF PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY IT SEEMED THAT IF THEY ADMITTED THAT TRUTH IT WOULD DESTROY FAITH IN GOD IN THE CREATION OF THE FIRMAMENT
252-29350-0012 AND HE UTILIZED THE LAW OF GRAVITATION AS A WEAPON AGAINST RELIGION JUST SO IT NOW SEEMS AS IF WE HAVE ONLY TO ADMIT THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY TO DESTROY THE CONCEPTION OF THE SOUL
252-29350-0013 UNINVITED DEFENDERS OF THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY TODAY USE THAT LAW AS A WEAPON AGAINST RELIGION THOUGH THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY IN HISTORY LIKE THE LAW OF COPERNICUS IN ASTRONOMY FAR FROM DESTROYING
252-29350-0014 AS IN THE QUESTION OF ASTRONOMY THEN SO IN THE QUESTION OF HISTORY NOW THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IS BASED ON THE RECOGNITION OR NONRECOGNITION OF SOMETHING ABSOLUTE
252-29350-0015 SERVING AS THE MEASURE OF VISIBLE PHENOMENA IN ASTRONOMY
252-29350-0016 IN HISTORY IT IS THE INDEPENDENCE OF PERSONALITY FREE WILL AS WITH ASTRONOMY THE DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNIZING THE MOTION OF THE EARTH LAY IN ABANDONING THE IMMEDIATE SENSATION OF THE EARTH'S FIXITY
252-29350-0017 AND OF THE MOTION OF THE PLANETS SO IN HISTORY THE DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNIZING THE SUBJECTION OF PERSONALITY TO THE LAWS OF SPACE TIME AND CAUSE
252-29350-0018 BUT AS IN ASTRONOMY THE NEW VIEW SAID IT IS TRUE THAT WE DO NOT FEEL THE MOVEMENT OF THE EARTH
252-29350-0019 IN THE FIRST CASE IT WAS NECESSARY TO RENOUNCE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF AN UNREAL IMMOBILITY IN SPACE AND TO RECOGNIZE A MOTION WE DID NOT FEEL IN THE PRESENT CASE IT IS SIMILARLY NECESSARY
252-29350-0020 TO RENOUNCE A FREEDOM THAT DOES NOT EXIST
