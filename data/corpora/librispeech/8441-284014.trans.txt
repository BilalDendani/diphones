8441-284014-0000 SAMMY WAS SO RELIEVED TO THINK THAT CHATTERER WAS NOT DEAD AND HE WAS SO TICKLED TO THINK THAT CHATTERER WHO ALWAYS THOUGHT HIMSELF SO SMART SHOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT
8441-284014-0001 THAT HE JUST HAD TO TORMENT CHATTERER BY LAUGHING AT HIM AND SAYING MEAN THINGS TO HIM UNTIL CHATTERER LOST HIS TEMPER AND SAID THINGS BACK QUITE IN THE OLD WAY THIS TICKLED SAMMY MORE THAN EVER
8441-284014-0002 FOR IT SOUNDED SO EXACTLY LIKE CHATTERER WHEN HE HAD BEEN A FREE LITTLE IMP OF MISCHIEF IN THE GREEN FOREST THAT SAMMY FELT SURE THAT CHATTERER HAD NOTHING THE MATTER WITH HIM
8441-284014-0003 BUT HE COULDN'T STOP VERY LONG TO MAKE FUN OF POOR CHATTERER IN THE FIRST PLACE FARMER BROWN'S BOY HAD PUT HIS HEAD OUT THE BARN DOOR TO SEE WHAT ALL THE FUSS WAS ABOUT IN THE SECOND PLACE
8441-284014-0004 SAMMY FAIRLY ACHED ALL OVER TO SPREAD THE NEWS THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST AND OVER THE GREEN MEADOWS YOU KNOW HE IS A GREAT GOSSIP AND THIS WAS SUCH UNUSUAL NEWS SAMMY KNEW VERY WELL THAT NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE HIM
8441-284014-0005 HE KNEW THAT THEY JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT SMART MISTER CHATTERER HAD REALLY BEEN CAUGHT AND NO ONE DID BELIEVE IT ALL RIGHT SAMMY WOULD REPLY IT DOESN'T MAKE THE LEAST BIT OF DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD TO ME
8441-284014-0006 WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IT OR NOT YOU CAN GO UP TO FARMER BROWN'S HOUSE AND SEE HIM IN PRISON YOURSELF JUST AS I DID SO LATE THAT AFTERNOON WHEN ALL WAS QUIET AROUND THE FARMYARD
8441-284014-0007 CHATTERER SAW SOMETHING VERY FAMILIAR BEHIND THE OLD STONE WALL AT THE EDGE OF THE OLD ORCHARD IT BOBBED UP AND THEN DROPPED OUT OF SIGHT AGAIN THEN IT BOBBED UP AGAIN ONLY TO DROP
8441-284014-0008 OUT OF SIGHT JUST AS QUICKLY IT LOOKS TO ME VERY MUCH AS IF PETER RABBIT IS OVER THERE AND FEELING VERY NERVOUS SAID CHATTERER TO HIMSELF AND THEN HE CALLED SHARPLY JUST AS WHEN
8441-284014-0009 RIGHT AWAY PETER'S HEAD BOBBED UP FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A JACK IN THE BOX AND THIS TIME IT STAYED UP PETER'S EYES WERE ROUND WITH SURPRISE AS HE STARED ACROSS AT CHATTERER'S PRISON
8441-284014-0010 OH IT'S TRUE GASPED PETER AS IF IT WERE AS HARD WORK TO BELIEVE HIS OWN EYES AS IT WAS TO BELIEVE SAMMY JAY
8441-284014-0011 AND THEN BECAUSE IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT AND HE REALLY DIDN'T DARE STAY ANOTHER MINUTE PETER WAVED GOOD BY TO CHATTERER AND STARTED FOR THE GREEN FOREST AS FAST AS HIS LONG LEGS COULD TAKE HIM
8441-284014-0012 A LITTLE LATER WHO SHOULD APPEAR PEEPING OVER THE STONE WALL BUT REDDY FOX
8441-284014-0013 YOU SEE REDDY KNEW THAT FARMER BROWN'S BOY
8441-284014-0014 AND THAT HE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR
8441-284014-0015 IT MADE CHATTERER ANGRY JUST TO SEE HIM SMARTY SMARTY MISTER SMARTY GLAD TO SEE YOU LOOKING HEARTY WEATHER'S FINE AS YOU CAN SEE WON'T YOU TAKE A WALK WITH ME SO SAID REDDY FOX
8441-284014-0016 KNOWING ALL THE TIME THAT CHATTERER COULDN'T TAKE A WALK WITH ANY ONE
8441-284014-0017 IN FACT HE DIDN'T HALF HEAR THE MEAN THINGS REDDY FOX SAID TO HIM YOU SEE IT WAS COMING OVER HIM MORE AND MORE THAT NOTHING COULD TAKE THE PLACE OF FREEDOM HE HAD A COMFORTABLE HOME PLENTY TO EAT
8441-284014-0018 BUT HE WAS A PRISONER AND HAVING THESE VISITORS MADE HIM REALIZE IT MORE THAN EVER SOMETHING VERY LIKE TEARS FILLED HIS EYES AND HE CREPT INTO HIS HOLLOW STUMP
