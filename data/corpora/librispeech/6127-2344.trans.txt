6127-2344-0000 WE ARE MAKING THE DEMAND FOR A STRONG NAVY A SPECIAL FEATURE IN OUR CAMPAIGN AND IT WILL BE PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE TO HAVE HYACINTH DRESSED IN HIS SAILOR SUIT HE'LL LOOK HEAVENLY THE QUESTION IS NOT HOW HE'LL LOOK BUT HOW HE'LL BEHAVE
6127-2344-0001 HE'S A DELIGHTFUL CHILD OF COURSE BUT THERE IS A STRAIN OF UNBRIDLED PUGNACITY IN HIM THAT BREAKS OUT AT TIMES IN A REALLY ALARMING FASHION YOU MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN THE AFFAIR OF THE LITTLE GAFFIN CHILDREN I HAVEN'T
6127-2344-0002 AND MET THE GAFFINS IN THEIR PERAMBULATOR AND HE DROVE THE GOAT FULL TILT AT THEM AND SENT THE PERAMBULATOR SPINNING LITTLE JACKY GAFFIN WAS PINNED DOWN UNDER THE WRECKAGE AND WHILE THE NURSE HAD HER HANDS FULL WITH THE GOAT
6127-2344-0003 NOTHING INTENTIONALLY BUT SOME ONE HAD UNFORTUNATELY TOLD HIM THAT THEY WERE HALF FRENCH THEIR MOTHER WAS A DUBOC YOU KNOW AND HE HAD BEEN HAVING A HISTORY LESSON THAT MORNING AND HAD JUST HEARD OF THE FINAL LOSS OF CALAIS BY THE ENGLISH AND WAS FURIOUS ABOUT IT
6127-2344-0004 HE SAID HE'D TEACH THE LITTLE TOADS TO GO SNATCHING TOWNS FROM US BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS REFERRING TO THE GAFFINS I TOLD HIM AFTERWARDS THAT ALL BAD FEELING BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS HAD DIED OUT LONG AGO AND THAT ANYHOW
6127-2344-0005 THE REST HAD BEEN BURIED UNDER THE PERAMBULATOR IF THE LOSS OF CALAIS UNLOOSED SUCH FURY IN HIM I TREMBLE TO THINK WHAT THE POSSIBLE LOSS OF THE ELECTION MIGHT ENTAIL ALL THAT HAPPENED WHEN HE WAS EIGHT HE'S OLDER NOW AND KNOWS BETTER
6127-2344-0006 CHILDREN WITH HYACINTH'S TEMPERAMENT DON'T KNOW BETTER AS THEY GROW OLDER THEY MERELY KNOW MORE NONSENSE
6127-2344-0007 AND THE NEW SAILOR SUIT THAT I'VE HAD MADE FOR HIM IS JUST IN THE RIGHT SHADE OF BLUE FOR OUR ELECTION COLOURS AND IT WILL EXACTLY MATCH THE BLUE OF HIS EYES HE WILL BE A PERFECTLY CHARMING NOTE OF COLOUR THERE IS SUCH A THING AS LETTING ONE'S AESTHETIC SENSE
6127-2344-0008 OVERRIDE ONE'S MORAL SENSE SAID MISSUS PANSTREPPON I BELIEVE YOU WOULD HAVE CONDONED THE SOUTH SEA BUBBLE AND THE PERSECUTION OF THE ALBIGENSES IF THEY HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT IN EFFECTIVE COLOUR SCHEMES HOWEVER
6127-2344-0009 THE ELECTION WAS KEENLY BUT DECOROUSLY CONTESTED THE NEWLY APPOINTED COLONIAL SECRETARY WAS PERSONALLY POPULAR WHILE THE GOVERNMENT TO WHICH HE ADHERED WAS DISTINCTLY UNPOPULAR AND THERE WAS SOME EXPECTANCY THAT THE MAJORITY OF FOUR HUNDRED OBTAINED AT THE LAST ELECTION
6127-2344-0010 WOULD BE ALTOGETHER WIPED OUT BOTH SIDES WERE HOPEFUL BUT NEITHER COULD FEEL CONFIDENT THE CHILDREN WERE A GREAT SUCCESS THE LITTLE JUTTERLYS DROVE THEIR CHUBBY DONKEYS SOLEMNLY UP AND DOWN THE MAIN STREETS DISPLAYING POSTERS
6127-2344-0011 WHICH ADVOCATED THE CLAIMS OF THEIR FATHER ON THE BROAD GENERAL GROUNDS THAT HE WAS THEIR FATHER WHILE AS FOR HYACINTH HIS CONDUCT MIGHT HAVE SERVED AS A MODEL FOR ANY SERAPH CHILD THAT HAD STRAYED UNWITTINGLY ON TO THE SCENE OF AN ELECTORAL CONTEST
6127-2344-0012 OF HIS OWN ACCORD AND UNDER THE DELIGHTED EYES OF HALF A DOZEN CAMERA OPERATORS HE HAD GONE UP TO THE JUTTERLY CHILDREN AND PRESENTED THEM WITH A PACKET OF BUTTERSCOTCH WE NEEDN'T BE ENEMIES BECAUSE WE'RE WEARING THE OPPOSITE COLOURS HE SAID WITH ENGAGING FRIENDLINESS
6127-2344-0013 AND THE OCCUPANTS OF THE DONKEY CART ACCEPTED HIS OFFERING WITH POLITE SOLEMNITY THE GROWN UP MEMBERS OF BOTH POLITICAL CAMPS WERE DELIGHTED AT THE INCIDENT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MISSUS PANSTREPPON WHO SHUDDERED NEVER WAS CLYTEMNESTRA'S KISS
6127-2344-0014 AND EVERY EFFORT WAS MADE TO BRING UP OBSTINATELY WAVERING ELECTORS IT WAS WITH A FEELING OF RELAXATION AND RELIEF THAT EVERY ONE HEARD THE CLOCKS STRIKE THE HOUR FOR THE CLOSE OF THE POLL
6127-2344-0015 THAT THEY HAD SEEN NOTHING OF THE CHILDREN FOR THE LAST HOUR WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE THREE LITTLE JUTTERLYS AND THEIR DONKEY CART AND FOR THE MATTER OF THAT WHAT HAD BECOME OF HYACINTH HURRIED ANXIOUS EMBASSIES WENT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BETWEEN THE RESPECTIVE PARTY HEADQUARTERS
6127-2344-0016 AND THE VARIOUS COMMITTEE ROOMS BUT THERE WAS BLANK IGNORANCE EVERYWHERE AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE CHILDREN EVERY ONE HAD BEEN TOO BUSY IN THE CLOSING MOMENTS OF THE POLL TO BESTOW A THOUGHT ON THEM THEN THERE CAME A TELEPHONE CALL AT THE UNIONIST WOMEN'S COMMITTEE ROOMS AND THE VOICE OF HYACINTH WAS HEARD
6127-2344-0017 I MET THEM DRIVING ABOUT A BACK ROAD AND TOLD THEM THEY WERE TO HAVE TEA WITH ME AND PUT THEIR DONKEYS IN A YARD THAT I KNEW OF THEN I TOOK THEM TO SEE AN OLD SOW THAT HAD GOT TEN LITTLE PIGS I GOT THE SOW INTO THE OUTER STYE BY GIVING HER BITS OF BREAD WHILE THE JUTTERLYS WENT IN TO LOOK AT THE LITTER
6127-2344-0018 THEN I BOLTED THE DOOR AND LEFT THEM THERE YOU WICKED
6127-2344-0019 THEY'RE JOLLY WELL CROWDED THEY WERE PRETTY MAD AT BEING SHUT IN BUT NOT HALF AS MAD AS THE OLD SOW IS AT BEING SHUT OUT FROM HER YOUNG ONES IF SHE GETS IN WHILE THEY'RE THERE SHE'LL BITE THEM INTO MINCEMEAT
6127-2344-0020 IF THEIR BLIGHTED FATHER GETS IN I'M JUST GOING TO OPEN THE DOOR FOR THE SOW AND LET HER DO WHAT SHE DASHED WELL LIKES TO THEM THAT'S WHY I WANT TO KNOW WHEN THE POLL WILL BE DECLARED HERE THE NARRATOR RANG OFF
6127-2344-0021 A WILD STAMPEDE AND A FRANTIC SENDING OFF OF MESSENGERS TOOK PLACE AT THE OTHER END OF THE TELEPHONE NEARLY ALL THE WORKERS ON EITHER SIDE HAD DISAPPEARED TO THEIR VARIOUS CLUB ROOMS AND PUBLIC HOUSE BARS TO AWAIT THE DECLARATION OF THE POLL
6127-2344-0022 THITHER WENT IN HEADLONG HASTE BOTH THE CANDIDATES HYACINTH'S MOTHER HIS AUNT MISSUS PANSTREPPON AND TWO OR THREE HURRIEDLY SUMMONED FRIENDS THE TWO NUBIAN DONKEYS CONTENTEDLY MUNCHING AT BUNDLES OF HAY MET THEIR GAZE AS THEY ENTERED THE YARD
6127-2344-0023 THE HOARSE SAVAGE GRUNTING OF AN ENRAGED ANIMAL AND THE SHRILLER NOTE OF THIRTEEN YOUNG VOICES THREE OF THEM HUMAN GUIDED THEM TO THE STYE IN THE OUTER YARD OF WHICH A HUGE YORKSHIRE SOW KEPT UP A CEASELESS RAGING PATROL BEFORE A CLOSED DOOR
6127-2344-0024 RECLINING ON THE BROAD LEDGE OF AN OPEN WINDOW FROM WHICH POINT OF VANTAGE HE COULD REACH DOWN AND SHOOT THE BOLT OF THE DOOR WAS HYACINTH HIS BLUE SAILOR SUIT SOMEWHAT THE WORSE OF WEAR AND HIS ANGEL SMILE EXCHANGED FOR A LOOK OF DEMONIACAL DETERMINATION
6127-2344-0025 A STORM OF THREATENING ARGUING ENTREATING EXPOSTULATION BROKE FROM THE BAFFLED RESCUE PARTY BUT IT MADE NO MORE IMPRESSION ON HYACINTH THAN THE SQUEALING TEMPEST THAT RAGED WITHIN THE STYE IF JUTTERLY HEADS THE POLL I'M GOING TO LET THE SOW IN
6127-2344-0026 I'LL TEACH THE BLIGHTERS TO WIN ELECTIONS FROM US HE MEANS IT SAID MISSUS PANSTREPPON I FEARED THE WORST WHEN I SAW THAT BUTTERSCOTCH INCIDENT IT'S ALL RIGHT MY LITTLE MAN SAID JUTTERLY WITH THE DUPLICITY TO WHICH EVEN A COLONIAL SECRETARY CAN SOMETIMES STOOP
6127-2344-0027 YOUR FATHER HAS BEEN ELECTED BY A LARGE MAJORITY LIAR RETORTED HYACINTH WITH THE DIRECTNESS OF SPEECH THAT IS NOT MERELY EXCUSABLE BUT ALMOST OBLIGATORY IN THE POLITICAL PROFESSION THE VOTES AREN'T COUNTED YET YOU WON'T GAMMON ME AS TO THE RESULT EITHER
6127-2344-0028 A BOY THAT I'VE PALLED WITH IS GOING TO FIRE A GUN WHEN THE POLL IS DECLARED TWO SHOTS IF WE'VE WON ONE SHOT IF WE HAVEN'T THE SITUATION BEGAN TO LOOK CRITICAL DRUG THE SOW WHISPERED HYACINTH'S FATHER SOME ONE WENT OFF IN THE MOTOR TO THE NEAREST CHEMIST'S SHOP
6127-2344-0029 AND RETURNED PRESENTLY WITH TWO LARGE PIECES OF BREAD LIBERALLY DOSED WITH NARCOTIC THE BREAD WAS THROWN DEFTLY AND UNOSTENTATIOUSLY INTO THE STYE BUT HYACINTH SAW THROUGH THE MANOEUVRE HE SET UP A PIERCING IMITATION OF A SMALL PIG IN PURGATORY
6127-2344-0030 YOU'RE ELEVEN AHEAD AT PRESENT AND ONLY ABOUT EIGHTY MORE TO BE COUNTED
6127-2344-0031 I MUSTN'T SQUEAK THROUGH EXCLAIMED JUTTERLY HOARSELY YOU MUST OBJECT TO EVERY DOUBTFUL VOTE ON OUR SIDE THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE DISALLOWED I MUST NOT HAVE THE MAJORITY THEN WAS SEEN THE UNPRECEDENTED SIGHT OF A PARTY AGENT CHALLENGING THE VOTES ON HIS OWN SIDE
6127-2344-0032 WERE DISALLOWED BUT EVEN SO JUTTERLY WAS SIX AHEAD WITH ONLY THIRTY MORE TO BE COUNTED TO THE WATCHERS BY THE STYE THE MOMENTS SEEMED INTOLERABLE AS A LAST RESORT SOME ONE HAD BEEN SENT FOR A GUN WITH WHICH TO SHOOT THE SOW
6127-2344-0033 A SUDDEN ROAR OF SHOUTING AND CHEERING WAS HEARD FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE TOWN HALL HYACINTH'S FATHER CLUTCHED A PITCHFORK AND PREPARED TO DASH INTO THE STYE IN THE FORLORN HOPE OF BEING IN TIME A SHOT RANG OUT IN THE EVENING AIR
6127-2344-0034 HYACINTH STOOPED DOWN FROM HIS PERCH AND PUT HIS FINGER ON THE BOLT THE SOW PRESSED FURIOUSLY AGAINST THE DOOR BANG CAME ANOTHER SHOT HYACINTH WRIGGLED BACK AND SENT A SHORT LADDER DOWN THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE INNER STYE
6127-2344-0035 HURRY UP I CAN'T KEEP THE SOW WAITING MUCH LONGER AND DON'T YOU JOLLY WELL COME BUTTING INTO ANY ELECTION AGAIN WHERE I'M ON THE JOB IN THE REACTION THAT SET IN AFTER THE DELIVERANCE FURIOUS RECRIMINATION WERE INDULGED IN BY THE LATELY OPPOSED CANDIDATES THEIR WOMEN FOLK AGENTS AND PARTY HELPERS
6127-2344-0036 A RECOUNT WAS DEMANDED BUT FAILED TO ESTABLISH THE FACT THAT THE COLONIAL SECRETARY HAD OBTAINED A MAJORITY ALTOGETHER THE ELECTION LEFT A LEGACY OF SORENESS BEHIND IT APART FROM ANY THAT WAS EXPERIENCED BY HYACINTH IN PERSON
6127-2344-0037 IT IS THE LAST TIME I SHALL LET HIM GO TO AN ELECTION EXCLAIMED HIS MOTHER THERE I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO EXTREMES SAID MISSUS PANSTREPPON
