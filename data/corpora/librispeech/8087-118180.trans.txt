8087-118180-0000 WITH POWER TO MAKE CERTAIN CAPITULATIONS AND CONVENTIONS WHO CAME INTO THIS KINGDOM WITH THREE HUNDRED MEN AND THERE FOUND A BENIGN MILD AND PEACEABLE PEOPLE AS THEY WERE THROUGHOUT THE INDIES
8087-118180-0001 TILL INJURED BY THE SPANIARDS THESE MORE CRUEL THEN THE REST BEYOND COMPARISON BEHAV'D THEMSELVES MORE INHUMANELY
8087-118180-0002 WOLVES AND LYONS FOR THEY HAD THE JURISDICTION OF THIS KINGDOM AND THEREFORE POSSESSING IT WITH THE GREATER FREEDOM FROM CONTROUL LAY IN WAIT
8087-118180-0003 AND WERE THE MORE VIGILANT WITH GREATER CARE AND AVARICE TO UNDERSTAND THE PRACTICAL PART OF HEAPING UP WEALTH AND ROBBING THE INHABITANTS OF THEIR GOLD AND SLIVER SURPASSING ALL THEIR PREDECESSORS IN THOSE
8087-118180-0004 INDIRECT WAYS REJECTING WHOLLY BOTH THE FEAR OF THEIR GOD AND KING NAY FORGETTING THAT THEY WERE BORN MEN WITH REASONABLE FACULTIES
8087-118180-0005 THESE INCARNATE DEVILS LAID WASTE AND DESOLATE FOUR HUNDRED MILES OF MOST FERTILE LAND CONTAINING VAST AND WONDERFUL PROVINCES MOST SPATIOUS AND LARGE VALLEYS
8087-118180-0006 SURROUNDED WITH HILLS FORTY MILES IN LENGTH AND MANY TOWNS RICHLY ABOUNDING IN GOLD AND SILVER THEY DESTROY'D SO MANY
8087-118180-0007 AND SUCH CONSIDERABLE REGIONS THAT THERE IS NOT ONE SUPERNUMERARY WITNESS LEFT TO RELATE THE STORY UNLESS PERCHANCE SOME THAT LURKT IN THE CAVERNS AND WOMB OF THE EARTH
8087-118180-0008 RUINATED FOUR OR FIVE MILLIONS OF SOULS AND SENT THEM ALL TO HELL I WILL GIVE A TASTE OF TWO OR THREE OF THEIR TRANSACTIONS THAT HEREBY YOU MAY GUESS AT THE REST
8087-118180-0009 THEY MADE THE SUPREAM LORD OF THE PROVINCE A SLAVE TO SQUEEZE HIS GOLD FROM HIM RACKING HIM TO EXTORT HIS CONFESSION WHO ESCAPING FLED INTO THE MOUNTAINS THEIR COMMON SANCTUARY
8087-118180-0010 AND HIS SUBJECTS LYING ABSCONDED IN THE THICKETS OF THE WOODS WERE STIR'D UP TO SEDITION AND TUMULT OR MUTINY THE SPANIARDS FOLLOW AND DESTROY MANY OF THEM BUT THOSE THAT WERE TAKEN ALIVE
8087-118180-0011 AND IN THEIR POWER WERE ALL PUBLICKLY SOLD FOR SLAVES BY THE COMMON CRIER THEY WERE IN ALL PROVINCES THEY CAME INTO ENTERTAINED AND WELCOMED BY THE INDIANS WITH SONGS DANCES AND RICH PRESENTS
8087-118180-0012 BUT REWARDED VERY UNGRATEFULLY WITH BLOODSHED AND SLAUGHTER THE GERMAN CAPTAIN AND TYRANT CAUSED SEVERAL OF THEM TO BE CLAPT INTO A THATCHT HOUSE AND THERE CUT IN PIECES
8087-118180-0013 BUT SOME OF THEM TO AVOID FALLING BY THEIR BLOODY AND MERCILESS SWORDS CLIMB'D UP TO THE BEAMS AND RAFTERS OF THE HOUSE AND THE GOVERNOUR HEARING IT O CRUEL BRUTE COMMANDED FIRE TO BE PUT TO IT
8087-118180-0014 BESTOWING ON THEM INNUMERABLE QUANTITIES OF GOLD BESIDES MANY OTHER GIFTS BUT WHEN THEY WERE UPON DEPARTURE IN RETRIBUTION OF THEIR CIVIL TREATING AND DEPORTMENT
8087-118180-0015 THE GERMAN TYRANT COMMANDED THAT ALL THE INDIANS WITH THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN IF POSSIBLE SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY INCLOSED IN SOME LARGE CAPACIOUS PLACE
8087-118180-0016 OR AT A CERTAIN RATE IMPOSED UPON HIMSELF HIS WIFE AND EVERY CHILDS HEAD AND TO EXPEDITE THE BUSINESS PROHIBITED THE ADMINISTRATION OR ALLOWANCE OF ANY FOOD TO THEM
8087-118180-0017 TILL THE GOLD REQUIRED FOR REDEMPTION WAS PAID DOWN TO THE UTMOST GRAIN SEVERAL OF THEM SENT HOME TO DISCHARGE THE DEMANDED PRICE OF THEIR REDEMPTION AND PROCUR'D THEIR FREEDOM
8087-118180-0018 AS WELL AS THEY COULD BY ONE MEANS OR OTHER THAT SO THEY MIGHT RETURN TO THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND PROFESSION BUT NOT LONG AFTER HE SENT OTHER ROGUES AND ROBBERS AMONG THEM TO ENSLAVE THOSE THAT WERE REDEEMED
8087-118180-0019 TO THE SAME GAOL THEY ARE BROUGHT A SECOND TIME BEING INSTIGATED OR RATHER CONSTRAINED TO A SPEEDY REDEMPTION BY HUNGER AND THIRST THUS MANY OF THEM WERE TWICE OR THRICE TAKEN
8087-118180-0020 CAPTIV'D AND REDEEDMED BUT SOME WHO WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DEPOSITING SUCH A SUM PERISHED THERE FARTHERMORE THIS TYRANT WAS BIG WITH AN ITCHING DESIRE
8087-118180-0021 AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE PERUSIAN MINES WHICH HE DID ACCOMPLISH NAY SHOULD I ENUMERATE THE PARTICULAR CRUELTIES SLAUGHTERS
8087-118180-0022 COMMITTED BY HIM THOUGH MY DISCOURSE WOULD NOT IN THE LEAST BE CONTRARIANT TO THE TRUTH YET IT WOULD NOT BE BELEIVED
8087-118180-0023 THIS COURSE THE OTHER TYRANTS TOOK WHO SET SAIL FROM VENECUELA AND SAINT MARTHA WITH THE SAME RESOLUTION OF DETECTING THE PERUSIAN GOLDEN CONSECRATED HOUSES AS THEM THEY ESTEEMED
8087-118180-0024 WHO FOUND THE FRUITFUL REGION SO DESOLATE DESERTED AND WASTED BY FIRE AND SWORD THAT THOSE CRUEL TYRANTS THEMSELVES WERE SMITTEN WITH WONDER AND ASTONISHMENT AT THE TRACES AND RUINS OF SUCH
8087-118180-0025 PRODIGIOUS DEVASTATIONS ALL THESE THINGS AND MANY MORE WERE PROV'D BY WITNESS IN THE INDIAN EXCHEQUER
8087-118180-0026 THOUGH THESE EXECRABLE TYRANTS BURNT MANY OF THEM THAT THERE MIGHT BE LITTLE OR NOTHING PROV'D AS A CAUSE OF THOSE GREAT DEVASTATIONS AND EVILS PERPETRATED BY THEM FOR THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE
8087-118180-0027 WHO HAVE HITHERTO LIVED IN INDIA THROUGH THEIR OBSCURE AND DAMNABLE BLINDNESS WERE NOT MUCH SOLLICITOUS ABOUT THE PUNISHMENT OF THE CRIMES AND BUTCHERIES WHICH HAVE BEEN AND
8087-118180-0028 DIMINISHED ALREADY OR RETRENCHED FROM HIS MAJESTIES ANNUAL REVENUE AND THIS GENERAL AND CONFUSED PROOF IS SUFFICIENT AS THEY WORTHILY CONCEIVE TO PURGE OR REPRESS SUCH GREAT AND
8087-118180-0029 HAINOUS CRIMES AND THOUGH THEY ARE BUT FEW ARE NOT VERIFIED AS THEY OUGHT TO BE NOR DO THEY ATTRIBUTE AND LAY UPON THEM THAT STRESS AND WEIGHT AS THEY OUGHT TO DO
8087-118180-0030 FOR IF THEY DID PERFORM THEIR DUTY TO GOD AND THE KING IT COULD NOT BE MADE APPARENT AS IT MAY BE THAT THESE GERMAN TYRANTS HAVE CHEATED AND ROB'D THE KING OF THREE MILLIONS OF GOLD AND UPWARD
8087-118180-0031 AND THUS THESE ENEMIES TO GOD AND THE KING BEGAN TO DEPOPULATE THESE REGIONS AND DESTROY THEM CHEATING HIS MAJESTY OF TWO MILLIONS OF GOLD PER ANNUM NOR CAN IT BE EXPECTED
8087-118180-0032 THAT THE DETRIMENT DONE TO HIS MAJESTY CAN POSSIBLY BE RETRIEV'D AS LONG AS THE SUN AND MOON ENDURES UNLESS GOD BY A MIRACLE SHOULD RAISE AS MANY THOUSANDS FROM DEATH TO LIFE
8087-118180-0033 AS HAVE BIN DESTROY'D AND THESE ARE THE TEMPORAL DAMMAGES THE KING SUFFERS IT WOULD BE ALSO A WORK WORTHY THE INQUIRY INTO TO CONSIDER HOW MANY CURSED
8087-118180-0034 SACRILEDGES AND INDIGNITIES GOD HIMSELF HATH BEEN AFFRONTED WITH TO THE DISHONOUR OF HIS NAME AND WHAT RECOMPENCE CAN BE MADE FOR THE LOSS OF SO MANY SOULS
8087-118180-0035 AS ARE NOW TORMENTED IN HELL BY THE CRUELTY AND COVETOUSNESS OF THESE BRUTISH GERMAN TYRANTS BUT I WILL CONCLUDE ALL THEIR IMPIETY AND BARBARISME WITH ONE EXAMPLE VIZ THAT
8087-118180-0036 COUNTRY TO THIS VERY DAY THAT IS SEVENTEEN YEARS THEY HAVE REMITTED MANY SHIPS FRAIGHTED WITH INDIANS TO BE SOLD AS SLAVES TO THE ISLES OF SAINT MARTHA HISPANIOLA JAMAICA
8087-118180-0037 IN THIS ISLAND SEEING AND KNOWING IT YET WHAT THEY FIND TO BE MANIFEST AND APPARENT THEY CONNIVE AT PERMIT AND COUNTENANCE AND WINK AT THE HORRID IMPIETIES AND DEVASTATIONS INNUMERABLE
8087-118180-0038 WHICH ARE COMMITTED ON THE COASTS OF THIS CONTINENT EXTENDING FOUR HUNDRED MILES IN LENGTH AND CONTINUES STILL TOGETHER WITH VENECUELA AND SAINT MARTHA UNDER THEIR JURISDICTION
