6249-290631-0000 TREACHERY THE DAY FOLLOWING THE COMING OF VAS KOR TO THE PALACE OF THE PRINCE OF HELIUM GREAT EXCITEMENT REIGNED THROUGHOUT THE TWIN CITIES REACHING ITS CLIMAX IN THE PALACE OF CARTHORIS
6249-290631-0001 WORD HAD COME OF THE ABDUCTION OF THUVIA OF PTARTH FROM HER FATHER'S COURT AND WITH IT THE VEILED HINT THAT THE PRINCE OF HELIUM MIGHT BE SUSPECTED OF CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ACT AND THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE PRINCESS
6249-290631-0002 JEDDAK OF HELIUM MORS KAJAK HIS SON JED OF LESSER HELIUM CARTHORIS AND A SCORE OF THE GREAT NOBLES OF THE EMPIRE THERE MUST BE NO WAR BETWEEN PTARTH AND HELIUM MY SON SAID JOHN CARTER
6249-290631-0003 THAT YOU ARE INNOCENT OF THE CHARGE THAT HAS BEEN PLACED AGAINST YOU BY INSINUATION WE WELL KNOW
6249-290631-0004 YOU MUST HASTEN AT ONCE TO THE COURT OF PTARTH AND BY YOUR PRESENCE THERE AS WELL AS BY YOUR WORDS ASSURE HIM THAT HIS SUSPICIONS ARE GROUNDLESS BEAR WITH YOU THE AUTHORITY OF THE WARLORD OF BARSOOM AND OF THE JEDDAK OF HELIUM
6249-290631-0005 TO OFFER EVERY RESOURCE OF THE ALLIED POWERS
6249-290631-0006 WHOMSOEVER THEY MAY BE GO I KNOW THAT I DO NOT NEED TO URGE UPON YOU THE NECESSITY FOR HASTE CARTHORIS LEFT THE COUNCIL CHAMBER AND HASTENED TO HIS PALACE
6249-290631-0007 HERE SLAVES WERE BUSY IN A MOMENT SETTING THINGS TO RIGHTS FOR THE DEPARTURE OF THEIR MASTER SEVERAL WORKED ABOUT THE SWIFT FLIER THAT WOULD BEAR THE PRINCE OF HELIUM RAPIDLY TOWARD PTARTH AT LAST ALL WAS DONE BUT TWO ARMED SLAVES REMAINED ON GUARD
6249-290631-0008 THE SETTING SUN HUNG LOW ABOVE THE HORIZON IN A MOMENT DARKNESS WOULD ENVELOP ALL ONE OF THE GUARDSMEN A GIANT OF A FELLOW ACROSS WHOSE RIGHT CHEEK THERE RAN A THIN SCAR FROM TEMPLE TO MOUTH
6249-290631-0009 APPROACHED HIS COMPANION HIS GAZE WAS DIRECTED BEYOND AND ABOVE HIS COMRADE WHEN HE HAD COME QUITE CLOSE HE SPOKE WHAT STRANGE CRAFT IS THAT HE ASKED THE OTHER TURNED ABOUT QUICKLY TO GAZE HEAVENWARD
6249-290631-0010 SCARCE WAS HIS BACK TURNED TOWARD THE GIANT THAN THE SHORT SWORD OF THE LATTER WAS PLUNGED BENEATH HIS LEFT SHOULDER BLADE STRAIGHT THROUGH HIS HEART VOICELESS THE SOLDIER SANK IN HIS TRACKS STONE DEAD
6249-290631-0011 QUICKLY THE MURDERER DRAGGED THE CORPSE INTO THE BLACK SHADOWS WITHIN THE HANGAR THEN HE RETURNED TO THE FLIER DRAWING A CUNNINGLY WROUGHT KEY FROM HIS POCKET POUCH
6249-290631-0012 HE REMOVED THE COVER OF THE RIGHT HAND DIAL OF THE CONTROLLING DESTINATION COMPASS FOR A MOMENT HE STUDIED THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MECHANISM BENEATH THEN HE RETURNED THE DIAL TO ITS PLACE SET THE POINTER
6249-290631-0013 AND REMOVED IT AGAIN TO NOTE THE RESULTANT CHANGE IN THE POSITION OF THE PARTS AFFECTED BY THE ACT A SMILE CROSSED HIS LIPS WITH A PAIR OF CUTTERS HE SNIPPED OFF THE PROJECTION WHICH EXTENDED THROUGH THE DIAL FROM THE EXTERNAL POINTER
6249-290631-0014 NOW THE LATTER MIGHT BE MOVED TO ANY POINT UPON THE DIAL WITHOUT AFFECTING THE MECHANISM BELOW IN OTHER WORDS THE EASTERN HEMISPHERE DIAL WAS USELESS NOW HE TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE WESTERN DIAL
6249-290631-0015 THIS HE SET UPON A CERTAIN POINT AFTERWARD HE REMOVED THE COVER OF THIS DIAL ALSO AND WITH KEEN TOOL CUT THE STEEL FINGER FROM THE UNDER SIDE OF THE POINTER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HE REPLACED THE SECOND DIAL COVER
6249-290631-0016 AND RESUMED HIS PLACE ON GUARD TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES THE COMPASS WAS AS EFFICIENT AS BEFORE BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT THE MOVING OF THE POINTERS UPON THE DIALS RESULTED NOW IN NO CORRESPONDING SHIFT OF THE MECHANISM BENEATH
6249-290631-0017 AND THE DEVICE WAS SET IMMOVABLY UPON A DESTINATION OF THE SLAVE'S OWN CHOOSING PRESENTLY CAME CARTHORIS ACCOMPANIED BY BUT A HANDFUL OF HIS GENTLEMEN
6249-290631-0018 HE CAST BUT A CASUAL GLANCE UPON THE SINGLE SLAVE WHO STOOD GUARD THE FELLOW'S THIN CRUEL LIPS AND THE SWORD CUT THAT RAN FROM TEMPLE TO MOUTH AROUSED THE SUGGESTION OF AN UNPLEASANT MEMORY WITHIN HIM
6249-290631-0019 HE WONDERED WHERE SARAN TAL HAD FOUND THE MAN THEN THE MATTER FADED FROM HIS THOUGHTS AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE PRINCE OF HELIUM WAS LAUGHING AND CHATTING WITH HIS COMPANIONS THOUGH BELOW THE SURFACE HIS HEART WAS COLD WITH DREAD
6249-290631-0020 FOR WHAT CONTINGENCIES CONFRONTED THUVIA OF PTARTH HE COULD NOT EVEN GUESS
6249-290631-0021 HAD STOLEN THE FAIR PTARTHIAN BUT ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE REPORT OF THE ABDUCTION
6249-290631-0022 THE COURT OF HIS FATHER IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HE THOUGHT CARTHORIS FOR ON THE VERY NIGHT THAT THUVIA WAS TAKEN ASTOK HAD BEEN IN DUSAR AND YET HE ENTERED THE FLIER
6249-290631-0023 EXCHANGING CASUAL REMARKS WITH HIS COMPANIONS AS HE UNLOCKED THE MECHANISM OF THE COMPASS AND SET THE POINTER UPON THE CAPITAL CITY OF PTARTH WITH A WORD OF FAREWELL HE TOUCHED THE BUTTON WHICH CONTROLLED THE REPULSIVE RAYS AND
6249-290631-0024 AS THE FLIER ROSE LIGHTLY INTO THE AIR THE ENGINE PURRED IN ANSWER TO THE TOUCH OF HIS FINGER UPON A SECOND BUTTON THE PROPELLERS WHIRRED AS HIS HAND DREW BACK THE SPEED LEVER
6249-290631-0025 AND CARTHORIS PRINCE OF HELIUM WAS OFF INTO THE GORGEOUS MARTIAN NIGHT BENEATH THE HURTLING MOONS AND THE MILLION STARS SCARCE HAD THE FLIER FOUND ITS SPEED ERE THE MAN WRAPPING HIS SLEEPING SILKS AND FURS ABOUT HIM
6249-290631-0026 TO SLEEP BUT SLEEP DID NOT COME AT ONCE AT HIS BIDDING INSTEAD HIS THOUGHTS RAN RIOT IN HIS BRAIN DRIVING SLEEP AWAY HE RECALLED THE WORDS OF THUVIA OF PTARTH
6249-290631-0027 WORDS THAT HAD HALF ASSURED HIM THAT SHE LOVED HIM
6249-290631-0028 SHE HAD ANSWERED ONLY THAT SHE WAS PROMISED TO HIM NOW HE SAW THAT HER REPLY WAS OPEN TO MORE THAN A SINGLE CONSTRUCTION IT MIGHT OF COURSE MEAN THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE KULAN TITH AND SO BY INFERENCE BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT SHE LOVED ANOTHER
6249-290631-0029 BUT WHAT ASSURANCE WAS THERE THAT THE OTHER WAS CARTHORIS OF HELIUM THE MORE HE THOUGHT UPON IT THE MORE POSITIVE HE BECAME THAT NOT ONLY WAS THERE NO ASSURANCE IN HER WORDS THAT SHE LOVED HIM
6249-290631-0030 BUT NONE EITHER IN ANY ACT OF HERS NO THE FACT WAS SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM SHE LOVED ANOTHER SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABDUCTED SHE HAD FLED WILLINGLY WITH HER LOVER
6249-290631-0031 WITH SUCH PLEASANT THOUGHTS FILLING HIM ALTERNATELY WITH DESPAIR AND RAGE CARTHORIS AT LAST DROPPED INTO THE SLEEP OF UTTER MENTAL EXHAUSTION THE BREAKING OF THE SUDDEN DAWN FOUND HIM STILL ASLEEP
6249-290631-0032 HIS FLIER WAS RUSHING SWIFTLY ABOVE A BARREN OCHRE PLAIN THE WORLD OLD BOTTOM OF A LONG DEAD MARTIAN SEA IN THE DISTANCE ROSE LOW HILLS TOWARD THESE THE CRAFT WAS HEADED AS IT APPROACHED THEM
6249-290631-0033 A GREAT PROMONTORY MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN FROM ITS DECK STRETCHING OUT INTO WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN A MIGHTY OCEAN AND CIRCLING BACK ONCE MORE TO ENCLOSE THE FORGOTTEN HARBOUR OF A FORGOTTEN CITY
6249-290631-0034 AN IMPOSING PILE OF WONDROUS ARCHITECTURE OF A LONG DEAD PAST THE COUNTLESS DISMAL WINDOWS VACANT AND FORLORN STARED SIGHTLESS FROM THEIR MARBLE WALLS
6249-290631-0035 THE WHOLE SAD CITY TAKING ON THE SEMBLANCE OF SCATTERED MOUNDS OF DEAD MEN'S SUN BLEACHED SKULLS THE CASEMENTS HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF EYELESS SOCKETS THE PORTALS GRINNING JAWS CLOSER CAME THE FLIER
6249-290631-0036 BUT NOW ITS SPEED WAS DIMINISHING YET
6249-290631-0037 WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF THE GROUND IT CAME TO REST FLOATING GENTLY IN THE LIGHT AIR AND AT THE SAME INSTANT AN ALARM SOUNDED AT THE SLEEPER'S EAR CARTHORIS SPRANG TO HIS FEET
6249-290631-0038 THERE INDEED WAS A GREAT CITY BUT IT WAS NOT PTARTH NO MULTITUDES SURGED THROUGH ITS BROAD AVENUES NO SIGNS OF LIFE BROKE THE DEAD MONOTONY OF ITS DESERTED ROOF TOPS NO GORGEOUS SILKS NO PRICELESS FURS
6249-290631-0039 LENT LIFE AND COLOUR TO THE COLD MARBLE AND THE GLEAMING ERSITE NO PATROL BOAT LAY READY WITH ITS FAMILIAR CHALLENGE SILENT AND EMPTY LAY THE GREAT CITY EMPTY AND SILENT THE SURROUNDING AIR WHAT HAD HAPPENED
6249-290631-0040 CARTHORIS EXAMINED THE DIAL OF HIS COMPASS THE POINTER WAS SET UPON PTARTH COULD THE CREATURE OF HIS GENIUS HAVE THUS BETRAYED HIM HE WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT QUICKLY HE UNLOCKED THE COVER
6249-290631-0041 TURNING IT BACK UPON ITS HINGE A SINGLE GLANCE SHOWED HIM THE TRUTH
6249-290631-0042 STEEL PROJECTION THAT COMMUNICATED THE MOVEMENT OF THE POINTER UPON THE DIAL TO THE HEART OF THE MECHANISM BENEATH HAD BEEN SEVERED
6249-290631-0043 AND WHY CARTHORIS COULD NOT HAZARD EVEN A FAINT GUESS BUT THE THING NOW WAS TO LEARN IN WHAT PORTION OF THE WORLD HE WAS AND THEN TAKE UP HIS INTERRUPTED JOURNEY ONCE MORE
6249-290631-0044 THE FIRST HAVING SHOWN THAT ITS POINTER HAD NOT BEEN SET AT ALL BENEATH THE SECOND DIAL HE FOUND THE STEEL PIN SEVERED AS IN THE OTHER BUT THE CONTROLLING MECHANISM HAD FIRST BEEN SET FOR A POINT UPON THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE
6249-290631-0045 HE HAD JUST TIME TO JUDGE HIS LOCATION ROUGHLY AT SOME PLACE SOUTH WEST OF HELIUM AND AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THE TWIN CITIES WHEN HE WAS STARTLED BY A WOMAN'S SCREAM BENEATH HIM
6249-290631-0046 LEANING OVER THE SIDE OF THE FLIER HE SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A RED WOMAN BEING DRAGGED ACROSS THE PLAZA BY A HUGE GREEN WARRIOR
6249-290631-0047 ONE OF THOSE FIERCE CRUEL DENIZENS OF THE DEAD SEA BOTTOMS AND DESERTED CITIES OF DYING MARS CARTHORIS WAITED TO SEE NO MORE REACHING FOR THE CONTROL BOARD HE SENT HIS CRAFT RACING PLUMMET LIKE TOWARD THE GROUND
