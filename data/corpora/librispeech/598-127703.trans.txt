598-127703-0011 AND THE COAST RANGES HAZY AND DIM IN THE DISTANCE FROM GLACIER POINT GO DOWN THE TRAIL INTO THE LOWER END OF THE ILLILOUETTE BASIN CROSS ILLILOUETTE CREEK AND FOLLOW IT TO THE FALL
598-127703-0012 WHERE FROM AN OUTJUTTING ROCK AT ITS HEAD YOU WILL GET A FINE VIEW OF ITS REJOICING WATERS AND WILD CANYON AND THE HALF DOME THENCE RETURNING TO THE TRAIL FOLLOW IT TO THE HEAD OF THE NEVADA FALL

598-127703-0018 THE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE YOSEMITE VALLEY AND ITS MANY DOMES THE STARR KING CLUSTER OF DOMES SENTINEL DOME GLACIER POINT AND PERHAPS THE MOST TREMENDOUSLY IMPRESSIVE OF ALL
598-127703-0019 THE VIEWS OF THE HOPPER SHAPED CANYON OF THE RIVER FROM THE HEAD OF THE NEVADA FALL TO THE HEAD OF THE VALLEY RETURNING TO THE TRAIL YOU DESCEND BETWEEN THE NEVADA FALL
598-127703-0020 AND THE LIBERTY CAP WITH FINE SIDE VIEWS OF BOTH THE FALL AND THE ROCK PASS ON THROUGH CLOUDS OF SPRAY AND ALONG THE RAPIDS TO THE HEAD OF THE VERNAL FALL ABOUT A MILE BELOW THE NEVADA
598-127703-0021 LINGER HERE IF NIGHT IS STILL DISTANT FOR VIEWS OF THIS FAVORITE FALL AND THE STUPENDOUS ROCK SCENERY ABOUT IT THEN DESCEND A STAIRWAY BY ITS SIDE FOLLOW A DIM TRAIL THROUGH ITS SPRAY

598-127703-0024 THE HEAD OF THE RIBBON FALL ACROSS THE BEAUTIFUL RIBBON CREEK BASIN AND BACK TO THE VALLEY BY THE BIG OAK FLAT WAGON ROAD
598-127703-0025 MAGNIFICENT VIEWS ARE OBTAINED AS YOU APPROACH IT AND PASS THROUGH ITS SPRAY THOUGH WHEN THE SNOW IS MELTING FAST YOU WILL BE WELL DRENCHED FROM THE FOOT OF THE FALL THE TRAIL ZIGZAGS UP A NARROW CANYON
598-127703-0026 BETWEEN THE FALL AND A PLAIN MURAL CLIFF THAT IS BURNISHED HERE AND THERE BY GLACIAL ACTION YOU SHOULD STOP A WHILE ON A FLAT IRON FENCED ROCK A LITTLE BELOW THE HEAD OF THE FALL
598-127703-0027 BESIDE THE ENTHUSIASTIC THRONG OF STARRY COMET LIKE WATERS TO LEARN SOMETHING OF THEIR STRENGTH THEIR MARVELOUS VARIETY OF FORMS AND ABOVE ALL THEIR GLORIOUS MUSIC
598-127703-0028 GATHERED AND COMPOSED FROM THE SNOW STORMS HAIL RAIN AND WIND STORMS THAT HAVE FALLEN ON THEIR GLACIER SCULPTURED DOMEY RIDGY BASIN REFRESHED AND EXHILARATED

598-127703-0033 FOR A TWO DAY TRIP I WOULD GO STRAIGHT TO MOUNT HOFFMAN SPEND THE NIGHT ON THE SUMMIT NEXT MORNING GO DOWN BY MAY LAKE TO TENAYA LAKE AND RETURN TO THE VALLEY BY CLOUD'S REST AND THE NEVADA AND VERNAL FALLS
598-127703-0034 AS ON THE FOREGOING EXCURSION YOU LEAVE THE VALLEY BY THE YOSEMITE FALLS TRAIL
598-127703-0035 A SHORT DISTANCE EAST OF PORCUPINE FLAT FROM THAT POINT PUSH STRAIGHT UP TO THE SUMMIT MOUNT HOFFMAN IS A MASS OF GRAY GRANITE THAT RISES ALMOST IN THE CENTER OF THE YOSEMITE PARK
598-127703-0036 ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN MILES IN A STRAIGHT LINE FROM THE VALLEY ITS SOUTHERN SLOPES ARE LOW AND EASILY CLIMBED AND ADORNED HERE AND THERE WITH CASTLE LIKE CRUMBLING PILES AND LONG JAGGED CRESTS
598-127703-0037 HORNBLENDE FELDSPAR GRANITE ZIRCON TOURMALINE ET CETERA WEATHERED OUT AND STREWN CLOSELY AND LOOSELY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SOWN BROADCAST THEIR RADIANCE IS FAIRLY DAZZLING IN SUNLIGHT
598-127703-0038 ALMOST HIDING THE MULTITUDE OF SMALL FLOWERS THAT GROW AMONG THEM AT FIRST SIGHT ONLY THESE RADIANT CRYSTALS ARE LIKELY TO BE NOTICED BUT LOOKING CLOSELY YOU DISCOVER A MULTITUDE OF VERY SMALL

598-127703-0041 YOU SAUNTER AMONG THE CRYSTALS AND FLOWERS AS IF YOU WERE WALKING AMONG STARS FROM THE SUMMIT NEARLY ALL THE YOSEMITE PARK IS DISPLAYED LIKE A MAP
598-127703-0042 NORTHWARD LIES YOSEMITE'S WIDE BASIN WITH ITS DOMES AND SMALL LAKES SHINING LIKE LARGER CRYSTALS EASTWARD THE ROCKY
598-127703-0043 BOUNDED BY ITS SNOWY PEAKS IN GLORIOUS ARRAY SOUTHWARD YOSEMITE AND WESTWARD THE VAST FOREST ON NO OTHER YOSEMITE PARK MOUNTAIN ARE YOU MORE LIKELY TO LINGER YOU WILL FIND IT A MAGNIFICENT SKY CAMP
598-127703-0044 CLUMPS OF DWARF PINE AND MOUNTAIN HEMLOCK WILL FURNISH RESIN ROOTS AND BRANCHES FOR FUEL AND LIGHT AND THE RILLS SPARKLING WATER
598-127703-0045 THOUSANDS OF THE LITTLE PLANT PEOPLE WILL GAZE AT YOUR CAMP FIRE WITH THE CRYSTALS AND STARS COMPANIONS AND GUARDIANS AS YOU LIE AT REST IN THE HEART OF THE VAST SERENE NIGHT
598-127703-0046 AND HUNDREDS OF SMOOTH ROCK WAVES THAT APPEAR TO BE COMING ROLLING ON TOWARDS YOU LIKE HIGH HEAVING WAVES READY TO BREAK
598-127703-0047 NO MOUNTAIN TOP COULD BE BETTER PLACED FOR THIS MOST GLORIOUS OF MOUNTAIN VIEWS TO WATCH AND SEE THE DEEPENING COLORS OF THE DAWN AND THE SUNBEAMS STREAMING THROUGH THE SNOWY HIGH SIERRA PASSES
598-127703-0048 AWAKENING THE LAKES AND CRYSTALS
598-127703-0049 WITH YOUR HEART AGLOW SPANGLING LAKE TENAYA AND LAKE MAY WILL BECKON YOU AWAY FOR WALKS ON THEIR ICE BURNISHED SHORES LEAVE TENAYA AT THE WEST END CROSS TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE OUTLET
598-127703-0050 AND GRADUALLY WORK YOUR WAY UP IN AN ALMOST STRAIGHT SOUTH DIRECTION TO THE SUMMIT OF THE DIVIDE BETWEEN TENAYA CREEK
598-127703-0051 AND FOLLOW THE DIVIDE TO CLOUDS REST AFTER A GLORIOUS VIEW FROM THE CREST OF THIS LOFTY GRANITE WAVE YOU WILL FIND A TRAIL ON ITS WESTERN END THAT WILL LEAD YOU DOWN PAST NEVADA AND VERNAL FALLS
598-127703-0052 TO THE VALLEY IN GOOD TIME PROVIDED YOU LEFT YOUR HOFFMAN SKY CAMP EARLY TWO DAY EXCURSIONS
598-127703-0053 ANOTHER GRAND TWO DAY EXCURSION IS THE SAME AS THE FIRST OF THE ONE DAY TRIPS AS FAR AS THE HEAD OF ILLILOUETTE FALL
598-127703-0054 AND PASS THE NIGHT WHERE I CAMPED FORTY ONE YEARS AGO
598-127703-0055 THE FIRST OF THE SIXTY FIVE THAT I DISCOVERED IN THE SIERRA GLACIAL PHENOMENA IN THE ILLILOUETTE BASIN ARE ON THE GRANDEST SCALE AND IN THE COURSE OF MY EXPLORATIONS I FOUND
598-127703-0056 WERE THE MOST INTERESTING OF THEM ALL THE PATH OF THE VANISHED GLACIER SHONE IN MANY PLACES AS IF WASHED WITH SILVER AND PUSHING UP THE CANYON ON THIS BRIGHT ROAD I PASSED LAKE AFTER LAKE IN SOLID BASINS OF GRANITE
598-127703-0057 AND MANY A MEADOW ALONG THE CANYON STREAM THAT LINKS THEM TOGETHER THE MAIN LATERAL MORAINES THAT BOUND THE VIEW BELOW THE CANYON ARE FROM A HUNDRED TO NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND WONDERFULLY REGULAR
598-127703-0058 LIKE ARTIFICIAL EMBANKMENTS COVERED WITH A MAGNIFICENT GROWTH OF SILVER FIR AND PINE BUT THIS GARDEN AND FOREST LUXURIANCE IS SPEEDILY LEFT BEHIND
598-127703-0059 AND PATCHES OF BRYANTHUS CASSIOPE AND ARCTIC WILLOWS BEGIN TO APPEAR THE SMALL LAKES WHICH A FEW MILES DOWN THE VALLEY ARE SO RICHLY BORDERED WITH FLOWERY MEADOWS
598-127703-0060 HAVE AT AN ELEVATION OF TEN THOUSAND FEET ONLY SMALL BROWN MATS OF CAREX LEAVING BARE ROCKS AROUND MORE THAN HALF THEIR SHORES YET
598-127703-0061 STRANGE TO SAY AMID ALL THIS ARCTIC REPRESSION THE MOUNTAIN PINE ON LEDGES AND BUTTRESSES OF RED MOUNTAIN SEEMS TO FIND THE CLIMATE BEST SUITED TO IT
598-127703-0062 SOME SPECIMENS THAT I MEASURED WERE OVER A HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND TWENTY FOUR FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE SHOWING HARDLY A TRACE OF SEVERE STORMS LOOKING AS FRESH AND VIGOROUS AS THE GIANTS OF THE LOWER ZONES
598-127703-0063 EVENING CAME ON JUST AS I GOT FAIRLY INTO THE MAIN CANYON IT IS ABOUT A MILE WIDE AND A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO MILES LONG
598-127703-0064 FROM MOUNTAIN TO MOUNTAIN SHUTS IT IN ON THE EAST MY CAMP WAS ON THE BRINK OF ONE OF THE LAKES IN A THICKET OF MOUNTAIN HEMLOCK PARTLY SHELTERED FROM THE WIND
598-127703-0065 EARLY NEXT MORNING I SET OUT TO TRACE THE ANCIENT GLACIER TO ITS HEAD PASSING AROUND THE NORTH SHORE OF MY CAMP LAKE I FOLLOWED THE MAIN STREAM FROM ONE LAKELET TO ANOTHER
598-127703-0066 ARE CONTINUED IN STRAGGLING MASSES ALONG THE WALLS
598-127703-0067 SOMETHING LIKE THE MUD CORN FROM A GRINDSTONE THIS SUGGESTED ITS GLACIAL ORIGIN FOR THE STREAM THAT WAS CARRYING IT ISSUED FROM A RAW LOOKING MORAINE THAT SEEMED TO BE IN PROCESS OF FORMATION
598-127703-0068 WITH A SLOPE OF ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT DEGREES CLIMBING TO THE TOP OF IT I DISCOVERED A VERY SMALL BUT WELL CHARACTERIZED GLACIER SWOOPING DOWN FROM THE SHADOWY CLIFFS OF THE MOUNTAIN TO ITS TERMINAL MORAINE
598-127703-0069 THE ICE APPEARED ON ALL THE LOWER PORTION OF THE GLACIER FARTHER UP IT WAS COVERED WITH SNOW
598-127703-0070 WAS FROM TWELVE TO FOURTEEN FEET WIDE THE MELTING SNOW AND ICE FORMED A NETWORK OF RILLS THAT RAN GRACEFULLY DOWN THE SURFACE OF THE GLACIER MERRILY SINGING IN THEIR SHINING CHANNELS
598-127703-0071 RISING EARLY WHICH WILL BE EASY AS YOUR BED WILL BE RATHER COLD AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SLEEP MUCH ANYHOW AFTER VISITING THE GLACIER CLIMB THE RED MOUNTAIN AND ENJOY THE MAGNIFICENT VIEWS FROM THE SUMMIT
598-127703-0072 AND THOSE OF THE YOSEMITE ROCKS ESPECIALLY THE HALF DOME AND THE UPPER PART OF THE NORTH WALL ARE VERY FINE BUT OF COURSE FAR THE MOST IMPOSING VIEW IS THE VAST ARRAY OF SNOWY PEAKS ALONG THE AXIS OF THE RANGE
598-127703-0073 AND GO DOWN INTO THE HEAD OF LITTLE YOSEMITE AND THENCE DOWN PAST THE NEVADA AND VERNAL FALLS TO THE VALLEY A TRULY GLORIOUS TWO DAY TRIP A THREE DAY EXCURSION
598-127703-0074 THE BEST THREE DAY EXCURSION AS FAR AS I CAN SEE IS THE SAME AS THE FIRST OF THE TWO DAY TRIPS UNTIL YOU REACH LAKE TENAYA
598-127703-0075 AND CAMP THERE ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY GO TO THE TOP OF MOUNT DANA IN TIME FOR THE GLORY OF THE DAWN
598-127703-0076 WHEN YOU LEAVE THE MOUNTAIN GO FAR ENOUGH DOWN THE NORTH SIDE FOR A VIEW OF THE DANA GLACIER
598-127703-0077 CROSSING OF BUDD CREEK WHERE YOU WILL FIND THE SUNRISE TRAIL BRANCHING OFF UP THE MOUNTAIN SIDE THROUGH THE FOREST IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION PAST THE WEST SIDE OF CATHEDRAL PEAK
598-127703-0078 WHICH WILL LEAD YOU DOWN TO THE VALLEY BY THE VERNAL AND NEVADA FALLS IF YOU ARE A GOOD WALKER YOU CAN LEAVE THE TRAIL WHERE IT BEGINS TO DESCEND A STEEP SLOPE IN THE SILVER FIR WOODS
598-127703-0079 TO ANY ONE NOT DESPERATELY TIME POOR THIS TRIP SHOULD HAVE FOUR DAYS INSTEAD OF THREE CAMPING THE SECOND NIGHT AT THE SODA SPRINGS
598-127703-0080 THENCE BY THE SUNRISE TRAIL TO CATHEDRAL PEAK VISITING THE BEAUTIFUL CATHEDRAL LAKE WHICH LIES ABOUT A MILE TO THE WEST OF CATHEDRAL PEAK EATING YOUR LUNCHEON AND THENCE TO CLOUDS REST AND THE VALLEY AS ABOVE
598-127703-0081 GLACIER LAKES AND GLACIER MEADOWS ET CETERA BUT SECTIONS OF THE MAGNIFICENT SILVER FIR
