6178-86034-0000 AND THEY WOULD SPEND WHOLE DAYS IN TRYING TO SEE WHICH COULD SHOOT THE HIGHEST THIS IS ALWAYS VERY DANGEROUS AND IT WAS A GREAT WONDER THEY DID NOT PUT THEIR EYES OUT BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER THEY MANAGED TO ESCAPE
6178-86034-0001 ONE MORNING WHEN THE PRINCE HAD DONE HIS LESSONS HE RAN OUT TO CALL HIS FRIEND AND THEY BOTH HURRIED OFF TO THE LAWN WHICH WAS THEIR USUAL PLAYGROUND THEY TOOK THEIR BOWS OUT OF THE LITTLE HUT WHERE THEIR TOYS WERE KEPT
6178-86034-0002 AND BEGAN TO SEE WHICH COULD SHOOT THE HIGHEST AT LAST THEY HAPPENED TO LET FLY THEIR ARROWS BOTH TOGETHER AND WHEN THEY FELL TO EARTH AGAIN THE TAIL FEATHER OF A GOLDEN HEN WAS FOUND STICKING IN ONE
6178-86034-0003 FOR THEY WERE BOTH ALIKE AND LOOK AS CLOSELY AS YOU WOULD YOU COULD SEE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM THE PRINCE DECLARED THAT THE ARROW WAS HIS AND THE GARDENER'S BOY WAS QUITE SURE IT WAS HIS AND ON THIS OCCASION HE WAS PERFECTLY RIGHT BUT AS THEY COULD NOT DECIDE THE MATTER THEY WENT STRAIGHT TO THE KING
6178-86034-0004 WHEN THE KING HAD HEARD THE STORY HE DECIDED THAT THE FEATHER BELONGED TO HIS SON BUT THE OTHER BOY WOULD NOT LISTEN TO THIS AND CLAIMED THE FEATHER FOR HIMSELF AT LENGTH THE KING'S PATIENCE GAVE WAY AND HE SAID ANGRILY VERY WELL
6178-86034-0005 AND IF YOU FAIL TO FIND HER YOUR HEAD WILL BE THE FORFEIT THE BOY HAD NEED OF ALL HIS COURAGE TO LISTEN SILENTLY TO THE KING'S WORDS HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE THE GOLDEN HEN MIGHT BE OR EVEN IF HE DISCOVERED THAT HOW HE WAS TO GET TO HER
6178-86034-0006 BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO DO THE KING'S BIDDING AND HE FELT THAT THE SOONER HE LEFT THE PALACE THE BETTER SO HE WENT HOME AND PUT SOME FOOD INTO A BAG AND THEN SET FORTH HOPING THAT SOME
6178-86034-0007 ACCIDENT MIGHT SHOW HIM WHICH PATH TO TAKE AFTER WALKING FOR SEVERAL HOURS HE MET A FOX WHO SEEMED INCLINED TO BE FRIENDLY
6178-86034-0008 WHERE ARE YOU GOING ASKED THE FOX
6178-86034-0009 BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES OR HOW I SHALL CATCH HER OH I CAN SHOW YOU THE WAY SAID THE FOX WHO WAS REALLY VERY GOOD NATURED FAR TOWARDS THE EAST IN THAT DIRECTION LIVES A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN WHO IS CALLED THE SISTER OF THE SUN
6178-86034-0010 SHE HAS THREE GOLDEN HENS IN HER HOUSE PERHAPS THE FEATHER BELONGS TO ONE OF THEM THE BOY WAS DELIGHTED AT THIS NEWS AND THEY WALKED ON ALL DAY TOGETHER THE FOX IN FRONT AND THE BOY BEHIND WHEN EVENING CAME THEY LAY DOWN TO SLEEP
6178-86034-0011 SUDDENLY ABOUT MIDNIGHT THE FOX GAVE A LOW WHINE AND DREW NEARER TO HIS BEDFELLOW COUSIN HE WHISPERED VERY LOW THERE IS SOMEONE COMING WHO WILL TAKE THE KNAPSACK AWAY FROM ME LOOK OVER THERE
6178-86034-0012 OH I DON'T THINK HE WILL ROB US SAID THE BOY AND WHEN THE MAN DREW NEAR HE TOLD THEM HIS STORY WHICH SO MUCH INTERESTED THE STRANGER THAT HE ASKED LEAVE TO TRAVEL WITH THEM AS HE MIGHT BE OF SOME USE SO WHEN THE SUN ROSE THEY SET OUT AGAIN
6178-86034-0013 THE FOX IN FRONT AS BEFORE THE MAN AND BOY FOLLOWING AFTER SOME HOURS THEY REACHED THE CASTLE OF THE SISTER OF THE SUN WHO KEPT THE GOLDEN HENS AMONG HER TREASURES
6178-86034-0014 THEY HALTED BEFORE THE GATE AND TOOK COUNSEL AS TO WHICH OF THEM SHOULD GO IN AND SEE THE LADY HERSELF I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST FOR ME TO ENTER AND STEAL THE HENS SAID THE FOX BUT THIS DID NOT PLEASE THE BOY AT ALL
6178-86034-0015 WELL GO THEN SAID THE FOX BUT BE CAREFUL NOT TO MAKE ANY MISTAKE STEAL ONLY THE HEN WHICH HAS THE FEATHER MISSING FROM HER TAIL AND LEAVE THE OTHERS ALONE THE MAN LISTENED BUT DID NOT INTERFERE AND THE BOY ENTERED THE COURT OF THE PALACE
6178-86034-0016 HE SOON SPIED THE THREE HENS STRUTTING PROUDLY ABOUT THOUGH THEY WERE REALLY ANXIOUSLY WONDERING IF THERE WERE NOT SOME GRAINS LYING ON THE GROUND THAT THEY MIGHT BE GLAD TO EAT AND AS THE LAST ONE PASSED BY HIM HE SAW SHE HAD ONE FEATHER MISSING FROM HER TAIL
6178-86034-0017 AT THIS SIGHT THE YOUTH DARTED FORWARD AND SEIZED THE HEN BY THE NECK SO THAT SHE COULD NOT STRUGGLE THEN TUCKING HER COMFORTABLY UNDER HIS ARM HE MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE GATE
6178-86034-0018 UNLUCKILY JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO GO THROUGH IT HE LOOKED BACK AND CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF WONDERFUL SPLENDOURS FROM AN OPEN DOOR OF THE PALACE AFTER ALL THERE IS NO HURRY HE SAID TO HIMSELF I MAY AS WELL SEE SOMETHING NOW I AM HERE
6178-86034-0019 AND TURNED BACK FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE HEN WHICH ESCAPED FROM UNDER HIS ARM AND RAN TO JOIN HER SISTERS HE WAS SO MUCH FASCINATED BY THE SIGHT OF ALL THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS WHICH PEEPED THROUGH THE DOOR THAT HE SCARCELY NOTICED THAT HE HAD LOST THE PRIZE HE HAD WON AND
6178-86034-0020 HE DID NOT REMEMBER THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS A HEN IN THE WORLD WHEN HE BEHELD THE SISTER OF THE SUN SLEEPING ON A BED BEFORE HIM FOR SOME TIME HE STOOD STARING THEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF WITH A START AND FEELING THAT HE HAD NO BUSINESS THERE SOFTLY STOLE AWAY
6178-86034-0021 AND WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO RECAPTURE THE HEN WHICH HE TOOK WITH HIM TO THE GATE ON THE THRESHOLD HE STOPPED AGAIN WHY SHOULD I NOT LOOK AT THE SISTER OF THE SUN HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF SHE IS ASLEEP AND WILL NEVER KNOW AND HE TURNED BACK FOR THE SECOND TIME AND ENTERED THE CHAMBER
6178-86034-0022 WHILE THE HEN WRIGGLED HERSELF FREE AS BEFORE WHEN HE HAD GAZED HIS FILL HE WENT OUT INTO THE COURTYARD AND PICKED UP HIS HEN WHO WAS SEEKING FOR CORN AS HE DREW NEAR THE GATE HE PAUSED WHY DID I NOT GIVE HER A KISS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
6178-86034-0023 I SHALL NEVER KISS ANY WOMAN SO BEAUTIFUL AND HE WRUNG HIS HANDS WITH REGRET SO THAT THE HEN FELL TO THE GROUND AND RAN AWAY BUT I CAN DO IT STILL HE CRIED WITH DELIGHT AND HE RUSHED BACK TO THE CHAMBER AND KISSED THE SLEEPING MAIDEN ON THE FOREHEAD BUT ALAS
6178-86034-0024 AND WORSE THAN THAT HER SISTERS BEGAN TO CLUCK SO LOUD THAT THE SISTER OF THE SUN WAS AWAKENED BY THE NOISE SHE JUMPED UP IN HASTE FROM HER BED AND GOING TO THE DOOR SHE SAID TO THE BOY
6178-86034-0025 YOU SHALL NEVER NEVER HAVE MY HEN TILL YOU BRING ME BACK MY SISTER WHO WAS CARRIED OFF BY A GIANT TO HIS CASTLE WHICH IS A LONG WAY OFF SLOWLY AND SADLY THE YOUTH LEFT THE PALACE AND TOLD HIS STORY TO HIS FRIENDS WHO WERE WAITING OUTSIDE THE GATE
6178-86034-0026 HOW HE HAD ACTUALLY HELD THE HEN THREE TIMES IN HIS ARMS AND HAD LOST HER I KNEW THAT WE SHOULD NOT GET OFF SO EASILY SAID THE FOX SHAKING HIS HEAD BUT THERE IS NO MORE TIME TO WASTE LET US SET OFF AT ONCE IN SEARCH OF THE SISTER LUCKILY I KNOW THE WAY
6178-86034-0027 THEY WALKED ON FOR MANY DAYS TILL AT LENGTH THE FOX WHO AS USUAL WAS GOING FIRST STOPPED SUDDENLY THE GIANT'S CASTLE IS NOT FAR NOW HE SAID
6178-86034-0028 WHILE I RETURN TO THE CASTLE AND TALK TO THE GIANTS FOR THERE ARE MANY OF THEM SO THAT THEY MAY NOT NOTICE THE ESCAPE OF THE PRINCESS A FEW MINUTES LATER THEY ARRIVED AT THE CASTLE
6178-86034-0029 AND THE FOX WHO HAD OFTEN BEEN THERE BEFORE SLIPPED IN WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THERE WERE SEVERAL GIANTS BOTH YOUNG AND OLD IN THE HALL AND THEY WERE ALL DANCING ROUND THE PRINCESS
6178-86034-0030 SO THE FOX STOOD UP AND DID HIS STEPS WITH THE BEST OF THEM BUT AFTER A WHILE HE STOPPED AND SAID I KNOW A CHARMING NEW DANCE THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU BUT IT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY TWO PEOPLE IF THE PRINCESS WILL HONOUR ME FOR A FEW MINUTES YOU WILL SOON SEE HOW IT IS DONE
6178-86034-0031 AH THAT IS DELIGHTFUL WE WANT SOMETHING NEW ANSWERED THEY AND PLACED THE PRINCESS BETWEEN THE OUTSTRETCHED ARMS OF THE FOX
6178-86034-0032 AND IN THE DARKNESS HAD BORNE THE PRINCESS TO THE GATE HIS COMRADES SEIZED HOLD OF HER AS THEY HAD BEEN BIDDEN AND THE FOX WAS BACK AGAIN IN THE HALL BEFORE ANYONE HAD MISSED HIM
6178-86034-0033 HERE IN MY ARMS REPLIED THE FOX DON'T BE AFRAID SHE IS QUITE SAFE AND HE WAITED UNTIL HE THOUGHT THAT HIS COMRADES HAD GAINED A GOOD START AND PUT AT LEAST FIVE OR SIX MOUNTAINS BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE GIANTS
6178-86034-0034 THEN HE SPRANG THROUGH THE DOOR CALLING AS HE WENT THE MAIDEN IS HERE TAKE HER IF YOU CAN AT THESE WORDS THE GIANTS UNDERSTOOD THAT THEIR PRIZE HAD ESCAPED
6178-86034-0035 WHO THEY SUPPOSED HAD THE PRINCESS ON HIS BACK THE FOX ON HIS SIDE WAS FAR TOO CLEVER TO CHOOSE THE SAME PATH THAT HIS FRIENDS HAD TAKEN
6178-86034-0036 TILL AT LAST EVEN HE WAS TIRED OUT
6178-86034-0037 INDEED HE WAS SO EXHAUSTED WITH HIS DAY'S WORK THAT HE NEVER HEARD THE APPROACH OF THE GIANTS AND THEIR HANDS WERE ALREADY STRETCHED OUT TO SEIZE HIS TAIL WHEN HIS EYES OPENED AND WITH A TREMENDOUS BOUND HE WAS ONCE MORE BEYOND THEIR REACH
6178-86034-0038 ALL THE REST OF THE NIGHT THE FOX RAN AND RAN BUT WHEN BRIGHT RED SPREAD OVER THE EAST HE STOPPED AND WAITED TILL THE GIANTS WERE CLOSE UPON HIM THEN HE TURNED AND SAID QUIETLY LOOK THERE IS THE SISTER OF THE SUN
6178-86034-0039 THE GIANTS RAISED THEIR EYES ALL AT ONCE AND WERE INSTANTLY TURNED INTO PILLARS OF STONE THE FOX THEN MADE EACH PILLAR A LOW BOW AND SET OFF TO JOIN HIS FRIENDS HE KNEW A GREAT MANY SHORT CUTS ACROSS THE HILLS
6178-86034-0040 AND ALL FOUR TRAVELLED NIGHT AND DAY TILL THEY REACHED THE CASTLE OF THE SISTER OF THE SUN WHAT JOY AND FEASTING THERE WAS THROUGHOUT THE PALACE AT THE SIGHT OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THEY HAD MOURNED AS DEAD AND THEY COULD NOT MAKE ENOUGH OF THE BOY WHO HAD GONE THROUGH SUCH DANGERS IN ORDER TO RESCUE HER
6178-86034-0041 THE GOLDEN HEN WAS GIVEN TO HIM AT ONCE AND MORE THAN THAT THE SISTER OF THE SUN TOLD HIM THAT IN A LITTLE TIME WHEN HE WAS A FEW YEARS OLDER SHE WOULD HERSELF PAY A VISIT TO HIS HOME AND BECOME HIS WIFE
6178-86034-0042 ALL DAY LONG THE BOY STOOD AT THE WINDOW LOOKING OVER THE SEA BY WHICH THE PRINCESS MUST TRAVEL BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF HER NOT EVEN THE TINIEST WHITE SAIL AND AS HE STOOD SOLDIERS CAME AND LAID HANDS ON HIM AND LED HIM UP TO THE CASK
6178-86034-0043 WHERE A BIG FIRE WAS BLAZING AND THE HORRID BLACK PITCH BOILING AND BUBBLING OVER THE SIDES HE LOOKED AND SHUDDERED BUT THERE WAS NO ESCAPE SO HE SHUT HIS EYES TO AVOID SEEING
6178-86034-0044 THE WORD WAS GIVEN FOR HIM TO MOUNT THE STEPS WHICH LED TO THE TOP OF THE CASK WHEN SUDDENLY SOME MEN WERE SEEN RUNNING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT CRYING AS THEY WENT THAT A LARGE SHIP WITH ITS SAILS SPREAD WAS MAKING STRAIGHT FOR THE CITY
6178-86034-0045 NO ONE KNEW WHAT THE SHIP WAS OR WHENCE IT CAME BUT THE KING DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE THE BOY BURNED BEFORE ITS ARRIVAL THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE TIME ENOUGH FOR THAT
6178-86034-0046 AND A WHISPER WENT THROUGH THE WATCHING CROWD THAT ON BOARD WAS THE SISTER OF THE SUN WHO HAD COME TO MARRY THE YOUNG PEASANT AS SHE HAD PROMISED IN A FEW MOMENTS MORE SHE HAD LANDED AND DESIRED TO BE SHOWN THE WAY TO THE COTTAGE WHICH HER BRIDEGROOM HAD SO OFTEN DESCRIBED TO HER
6178-86034-0047 AND WHITHER HE HAD BEEN LED BACK BY THE KING'S ORDER
6178-86034-0048 KISS ME SAID THE SISTER OF THE SUN AND THE YOUTH OBEYED HER BUT STILL WITHOUT LOOKING UP DON'T YOU KNOW ME NOW
6178-86034-0049 I DON'T KNOW YOU HE REPLIED WITH THE MANNER OF A MAN WHOM FEAR HAD DRIVEN MAD AT THIS THE SISTER OF THE SUN GREW RATHER FRIGHTENED AND BEGINNING AT THE BEGINNING SHE TOLD HIM THE STORY OF HIS MEETING WITH HER
6178-86034-0050 AND HOW SHE HAD COME A LONG WAY IN ORDER TO MARRY HIM AND JUST AS SHE HAD FINISHED IN WALKED THE KING TO SEE IF WHAT THE BOY HAD SAID WAS REALLY TRUE BUT HARDLY HAD HE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE COTTAGE WHEN HE WAS ALMOST BLINDED BY THE LIGHT THAT FILLED IT
6178-86034-0051 AND HE REMEMBERED WHAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD ABOUT THE STAR ON THE FOREHEAD OF THE PRINCESS HE STAGGERED BACK AS IF HE HAD BEEN STRUCK THEN A CURIOUS FEELING TOOK HOLD OF HIM
6178-86034-0052 WHICH HE HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE AND FALLING ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE SISTER OF THE SUN HE IMPLORED HER TO GIVE UP ALL THOUGHT OF THE PEASANT BOY AND TO SHARE HIS THRONE BUT SHE LAUGHED AND SAID SHE HAD A FINER THRONE OF HER OWN IF SHE WANTED TO SIT ON IT
6178-86034-0053 AND THAT SHE WAS FREE TO PLEASE HERSELF AND WOULD HAVE NO HUSBAND BUT THE BOY WHOM SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE SEEN EXCEPT FOR THE KING HIMSELF I SHALL MARRY HIM TO MORROW ENDED SHE AND ORDERED THE PREPARATIONS TO BE SET ON FOOT AT ONCE
6178-86034-0054 WHEN THE NEXT DAY CAME HOWEVER THE BRIDEGROOM'S FATHER INFORMED THE PRINCESS THAT BY THE LAW OF THE LAND THE MARRIAGE MUST TAKE PLACE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE KING
6178-86034-0055 AN HOUR OR TWO PASSED AND EVERYONE WAS WAITING AND WATCHING WHEN AT LAST THE SOUND OF TRUMPETS WAS HEARD AND A GRAND PROCESSION WAS SEEN MARCHING UP THE STREET A CHAIR COVERED WITH VELVET HAD BEEN MADE READY FOR THE KING AND HE TOOK HIS SEAT UPON IT AND LOOKING ROUND UPON THE ASSEMBLED COMPANY HE SAID
6178-86034-0056 I HAVE NO WISH TO FORBID THIS MARRIAGE BUT BEFORE I CAN ALLOW IT TO BE CELEBRATED THE BRIDEGROOM MUST PROVE HIMSELF WORTHY OF SUCH A BRIDE BY FULFILLING THREE TASKS AND THE FIRST IS THAT IN A SINGLE DAY HE MUST CUT DOWN EVERY TREE IN AN ENTIRE FOREST
6178-86034-0057 HE HAD NEVER CUT DOWN A TREE IN HIS LIFE AND HAD NOT THE LEAST IDEA HOW TO BEGIN AND AS FOR A WHOLE FOREST
6178-86034-0058 WHAT WAS PASSING IN HIS MIND AND WHISPERED TO HIM DON'T BE AFRAID IN MY SHIP YOU WILL FIND AN AXE WHICH YOU MUST CARRY OFF TO THE FOREST WHEN YOU HAVE CUT DOWN ONE TREE WITH IT JUST SAY SO LET THE FOREST FALL
6178-86034-0059 AND IN AN INSTANT ALL THE TREES WILL BE ON THE GROUND BUT PICK UP THREE CHIPS OF THE TREE YOU FELLED AND PUT THEM IN YOUR POCKET AND THE YOUNG MAN DID EXACTLY AS HE WAS BID AND SOON RETURNED WITH THE THREE CHIPS SAFE IN HIS COAT
6178-86034-0060 HOWEVER IN CONSIDERATION OF WHAT THE YOUTH HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE HE HOPED HIS MAJESTY'S HEART MIGHT BE SOFTENED ESPECIALLY AS HE HAD SENT A MESSAGE THAT THEY MIGHT EXPECT HIM AT ONCE WITH THIS THE BRIDAL PAIR HAD TO BE CONTENT
6178-86034-0061 AND BE AS PATIENT AS THEY COULD TILL THE KING'S ARRIVAL HE DID NOT KEEP THEM LONG BUT THEY SAW BY HIS FACE THAT NOTHING GOOD AWAITED THEM
6178-86034-0062 THE MARRIAGE CANNOT TAKE PLACE HE SAID SHORTLY TILL THE YOUTH HAS JOINED TO THEIR ROOTS ALL THE TREES HE CUT DOWN YESTERDAY THIS SOUNDED MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN WHAT HE HAD DONE BEFORE AND HE TURNED IN DESPAIR TO THE SISTER OF THE SUN
6178-86034-0063 TAKE THIS WATER AND SPRINKLE IT ON ONE OF THE FALLEN TREES AND SAY TO IT SO LET ALL THE TREES OF THE FOREST STAND UPRIGHT AND IN A MOMENT THEY WILL BE ERECT AGAIN
6178-86034-0064 AND THE YOUNG MAN DID WHAT HE WAS TOLD AND LEFT THE FOREST LOOKING EXACTLY AS IT HAD DONE BEFORE NOW SURELY THOUGHT THE PRINCESS THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY NEED TO PUT OFF THE WEDDING AND SHE GAVE ORDERS THAT ALL SHOULD BE READY FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY
6178-86034-0065 BUT AGAIN THE OLD MAN INTERFERED AND DECLARED THAT WITHOUT THE KING'S PERMISSION NO MARRIAGE COULD TAKE PLACE FOR THE THIRD TIME HIS MAJESTY WAS SENT FOR AND FOR THE THIRD TIME HE PROCLAIMED THAT HE COULD NOT GIVE HIS CONSENT UNTIL THE BRIDEGROOM SHOULD HAVE SLAIN A SERPENT
6178-86034-0066 WHICH DWELT IN A BROAD RIVER THAT FLOWED AT THE BACK OF THE CASTLE EVERYONE KNEW STORIES OF THIS TERRIBLE SERPENT THOUGH NO ONE HAD ACTUALLY SEEN IT BUT FROM TIME TO TIME A CHILD STRAYED FROM HOME AND NEVER CAME BACK
6178-86034-0067 AND THEN MOTHERS WOULD FORBID THE OTHER CHILDREN TO GO NEAR THE RIVER WHICH HAD JUICY FRUITS AND LOVELY FLOWERS GROWING ALONG ITS BANKS SO NO WONDER THE YOUTH TREMBLED AND TURNED PALE WHEN HE HEARD WHAT LAY BEFORE HIM
6178-86034-0068 YOU WILL SUCCEED IN THIS ALSO WHISPERED THE SISTER OF THE SUN PRESSING HIS HAND FOR IN MY SHIP IS A MAGIC SWORD WHICH WILL CUT THROUGH EVERYTHING GO DOWN TO THE RIVER AND UNFASTEN A BOAT WHICH LIES MOORED THERE AND THROW THE CHIPS INTO THE WATER
6178-86034-0069 WHEN THE SERPENT REARS UP ITS BODY YOU WILL CUT OFF ITS THREE HEADS WITH ONE BLOW OF YOUR SWORD THEN TAKE THE TIP OF EACH TONGUE AND GO WITH IT TO MORROW MORNING INTO THE KING'S KITCHEN IF THE KING HIMSELF SHOULD ENTER JUST SAY TO HIM
6178-86034-0070 HERE ARE THREE GIFTS I OFFER YOU IN RETURN FOR THE SERVICES YOU DEMANDED OF ME AND THROW THE TIPS OF THE SERPENT'S TONGUES AT HIM AND HASTEN TO THE SHIP AS FAST AS YOUR LEGS WILL CARRY YOU
6178-86034-0071 THE YOUNG MAN DID EXACTLY WHAT THE PRINCESS HAD TOLD HIM THE THREE CHIPS WHICH HE FLUNG INTO THE RIVER BECAME A BOAT AND AS HE STEERED ACROSS THE STREAM THE SERPENT PUT UP ITS HEAD AND HISSED LOUDLY
6178-86034-0072 THE YOUTH HAD HIS SWORD READY AND IN ANOTHER SECOND THE THREE HEADS WERE BOBBING ON THE WATER GUIDING HIS BOAT TILL HE WAS BESIDE THEM HE STOOPED DOWN AND SNIPPED OFF THE ENDS OF THE TONGUES
6178-86034-0073 AND THEN ROWED BACK TO THE OTHER BANK NEXT MORNING HE CARRIED THEM INTO THE ROYAL KITCHEN AND WHEN THE KING ENTERED AS WAS HIS CUSTOM TO SEE WHAT HE WAS GOING TO HAVE FOR DINNER
6178-86034-0074 THE BRIDEGROOM FLUNG THEM IN HIS FACE SAYING HERE IS A GIFT FOR YOU IN RETURN FOR THE SERVICES YOU ASKED OF ME AND OPENING THE KITCHEN DOOR HE FLED TO THE SHIP UNLUCKILY HE MISSED THE WAY AND IN HIS EXCITEMENT RAN BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WITHOUT KNOWING WHITHER HE WAS GOING
6178-86034-0075 AT LAST IN DESPAIR HE LOOKED ROUND AND SAW TO HIS AMAZEMENT THAT BOTH THE CITY AND PALACE HAD VANISHED COMPLETELY THEN HE TURNED HIS EYES IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AND FAR FAR AWAY HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE SHIP
6178-86034-0076 WITH HER SAILS SPREAD AND A FAIR WIND BEHIND HER THIS DREADFUL SPECTACLE SEEMED TO TAKE AWAY HIS SENSES AND ALL DAY LONG HE WANDERED ABOUT WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS GOING TILL IN THE EVENING HE NOTICED SOME SMOKE FROM A LITTLE HUT OF TURF NEAR BY
6178-86034-0077 HE WENT STRAIGHT UP TO IT AND CRIED O MOTHER LET ME COME IN FOR PITY'S SAKE THE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN THE HUT BECKONED TO HIM TO ENTER AND HARDLY WAS HE INSIDE WHEN HE CRIED AGAIN O MOTHER CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING OF THE SISTER OF THE SUN
6178-86034-0078 BUT THE WOMAN ONLY SHOOK HER HEAD NO I KNOW NOTHING OF HER SAID SHE THE YOUNG MAN TURNED TO LEAVE THE HUT BUT THE OLD WOMAN STOPPED HIM AND GIVING HIM A LETTER BEGGED HIM TO CARRY IT TO HER NEXT ELDEST SISTER SAYING IF YOU SHOULD GET TIRED ON THE WAY
6178-86034-0079 TAKE OUT THE LETTER AND RUSTLE THE PAPER THIS ADVICE SURPRISED THE YOUNG MAN A GOOD DEAL AS HE DID NOT SEE HOW IT COULD HELP HIM BUT HE DID NOT ANSWER AND WENT DOWN THE ROAD WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS GOING AT LENGTH HE GREW SO TIRED HE COULD WALK NO MORE
6178-86034-0080 THEN HE REMEMBERED WHAT THE OLD WOMAN HAD SAID AFTER HE HAD RUSTLED THE LEAVES ONLY ONCE ALL FATIGUE DISAPPEARED AND HE STRODE OVER THE GRASS TILL HE CAME TO ANOTHER LITTLE TURF HUT LET ME IN I PRAY YOU DEAR MOTHER CRIED HE AND THE DOOR OPENED IN FRONT OF HIM
6178-86034-0081 O MOTHER CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING OF THE SISTER OF THE SUN NO I KNOW NOTHING OF HER ANSWERED SHE BUT AS HE TURNED HOPELESSLY AWAY SHE STOPPED HIM IF YOU HAPPEN TO PASS MY ELDEST SISTER'S HOUSE WILL YOU GIVE HER THIS LETTER SAID SHE
6178-86034-0082 AND IF YOU SHOULD GET TIRED ON THE ROAD JUST TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR POCKET AND RUSTLE THE PAPER SO THE YOUNG MAN PUT THE LETTER IN HIS POCKET AND WALKED ALL DAY OVER THE HILLS TILL HE REACHED A LITTLE TURF HUT EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHER TWO
6178-86034-0083 LET ME IN I PRAY YOU DEAR MOTHER CRIED HE AND AS HE ENTERED HE ADDED HERE IS A LETTER FROM YOUR SISTER AND CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING OF THE SISTER OF THE SUN YES I CAN ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN
6178-86034-0084 SHE LIVES IN THE CASTLE ON THE BANKA HER FATHER LOST A BATTLE ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO BECAUSE YOU HAD STOLEN HIS SWORD FROM HIM AND THE SISTER OF THE SUN HERSELF IS ALMOST DEAD OF GRIEF
6178-86034-0085 AND SUCK THE DROPS OF BLOOD THAT FLOW THEN SHE WILL GROW CALMER AND WILL KNOW YOU AGAIN ONLY BEWARE FOR BEFORE YOU REACH THE CASTLE ON THE BANKA FEARFUL THINGS WILL HAPPEN
6178-86034-0086 HE THANKED THE OLD WOMAN WITH TEARS OF GLADNESS FOR THE GOOD NEWS SHE HAD GIVEN HIM AND CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY BUT HE HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR WHEN AT A TURN OF THE ROAD HE MET WITH TWO BROTHERS WHO WERE QUARRELLING OVER A PIECE OF CLOTH
6178-86034-0087 MY GOOD MEN WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING ABOUT SAID HE THAT CLOTH DOES NOT LOOK WORTH MUCH OH IT IS RAGGED ENOUGH ANSWERED THEY BUT IT WAS LEFT US BY OUR FATHER AND IF ANY MAN WRAPS IT ROUND HIM NO ONE CAN SEE HIM AND WE EACH WANT IT FOR OUR OWN
6178-86034-0088 LET ME PUT IT ROUND ME FOR A MOMENT SAID THE YOUTH AND THEN I WILL TELL YOU WHOSE IT OUGHT TO BE THE BROTHERS WERE PLEASED WITH THIS IDEA AND GAVE HIM THE STUFF BUT THE MOMENT HE HAD THROWN IT OVER HIS SHOULDER HE DISAPPEARED AS COMPLETELY AS IF HE HAD NEVER BEEN THERE AT ALL
6178-86034-0089 MEANWHILE THE YOUNG MAN WALKED BRISKLY ALONG TILL HE CAME UP WITH TWO OTHER MEN WHO WERE DISPUTING OVER A TABLE CLOTH WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED HE STOPPING IN FRONT OF THEM IF THIS CLOTH IS SPREAD ON A TABLE ANSWERED THEY
6178-86034-0090 THE TABLE IS INSTANTLY COVERED WITH THE MOST DELICIOUS FOOD AND WE EACH WANT TO HAVE IT LET ME TRY THE TABLE CLOTH SAID THE YOUTH AND I WILL TELL YOU WHOSE IT OUGHT TO BE THE TWO MEN WERE QUITE PLEASED WITH THIS IDEA AND HANDED HIM THE CLOTH
6178-86034-0091 HE THEN HASTILY THREW THE FIRST PIECE OF STUFF ROUND HIS SHOULDERS AND VANISHED FROM SIGHT LEAVING THE TWO MEN GRIEVING OVER THEIR OWN FOLLY THE YOUNG MAN HAD NOT WALKED FAR BEFORE HE SAW TWO MORE MEN STANDING BY THE ROAD SIDE BOTH GRASPING THE SAME STOUT STAFF
6178-86034-0092 AND SOMETIMES ONE SEEMED ON THE POINT OF GETTING IT AND SOMETIMES THE OTHER WHAT ARE YOU QUARRELLING ABOUT YOU COULD CUT A DOZEN STICKS FROM THE WOOD EACH JUST AS GOOD AS THAT SAID THE YOUNG MAN AND AS HE SPOKE THE FIGHTERS BOTH STOPPED AND LOOKED AT HIM AH YOU MAY THINK SO SAID ONE
6178-86034-0093 BUT A BLOW FROM ONE END OF THIS STICK WILL KILL A MAN WHILE A TOUCH FROM THE OTHER END WILL BRING HIM BACK TO LIFE YOU WON'T EASILY FIND ANOTHER STICK LIKE THAT NO THAT IS TRUE ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN LET ME JUST LOOK AT IT AND I WILL TELL YOU WHOSE IT OUGHT TO BE THE MEN WERE PLEASED
6178-86034-0094 WITH THE IDEA AND HANDED HIM THE STAFF IT IS VERY CURIOUS CERTAINLY SAID HE BUT WHICH END IS IT THAT RESTORES PEOPLE TO LIFE AFTER ALL ANYONE CAN BE KILLED BY A BLOW FROM A STICK IF IT IS ONLY HARD ENOUGH
6178-86034-0095 AT LAST HE SAW ANOTHER SET OF MEN WHO WERE STRUGGLING FOR THE POSSESSION OF A PAIR OF SHOES
6178-86034-0096 WHY YOU COULD NOT WALK A YARD IN THEM YES THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH ANSWERED THEY BUT WHOEVER PUTS THEM ON AND WISHES HIMSELF AT A PARTICULAR PLACE GETS THERE WITHOUT GOING THAT SOUNDS VERY CLEVER SAID THE YOUTH LET ME TRY THEM AND THEN I SHALL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU WHOSE THEY OUGHT TO BE
6178-86034-0097 THE IDEA PLEASED THE MEN AND THEY HANDED HIM THE SHOES BUT THE MOMENT THEY WERE ON HIS FEET HE CRIED I WISH TO BE IN THE CASTLE ON THE BANKA AND BEFORE HE KNEW IT HE WAS THERE AND FOUND THE SISTER OF THE SUN DYING OF GRIEF
6178-86034-0098 HE KNELT DOWN BY HER SIDE AND PULLING A PIN HE STUCK IT INTO THE PALM OF HER HAND SO THAT A DROP OF BLOOD GUSHED OUT THIS HE SUCKED AS HE HAD BEEN TOLD TO DO BY THE OLD WOMAN AND IMMEDIATELY THE PRINCESS CAME TO HERSELF AND FLUNG HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK
6178-86034-0099 THEN SHE TOLD HIM ALL HER STORY
