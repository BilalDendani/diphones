7756-84187-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY ONE OFF AGAIN A SHORT HALT OF A DAY OR TWO ONLY WAS MADE BY THE LAKE AT FIRST AND THEN AN EXCURSION
7756-84187-0001 WHICH HAD BEEN MADE SUCCESSFULLY IN SEARCH OF GAME HAVING RESULTED IN THE DISCOVERY OF A MORE SUITABLE SPOT HIGHER UP TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS A WEEK WAS SPENT THERE IN A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE VALLEY WHERE AN ABUNDANT STREAM OF CRYSTAL PURITY EMPTIED ITSELF INTO THE WIDE SPREADING LAKE
7756-84187-0002 PASTURAGE WAS THERE FOR THE HORSES AND MULES AND ALMOST WITHOUT EFFORT FOOD WAS TO BE HAD AT THE EXPENSE OF A FEW CARTRIDGES WHILE VERY LITTLE SKILL WAS NEEDED FOR GRIGGS AND THE BOYS TO DRAW SALMON LIKE AND TROUT LIKE FISH TO THE BANKS
7756-84187-0003 IN A DAY OR TWO THE PERILS AND SUFFERINGS OF THE JOURNEY ACROSS THE SALT PLAINS WERE FORGOTTEN AND CAREFUL SEARCHING FOR SIGNS OF INDIANS HAVING PROVED THAT THEY WERE THE SOLE OCCUPANTS OF THE DISTRICT
7756-84187-0004 THE WHOLE PARTY GAVE THEMSELVES UP TO THE PLEASURES OF THE PEACEFUL LIFE THEY WERE ENJOYING BUT NOT FOR LONG GRIGGS HAD ENTERED INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE CHASE THE FISHING AND THE SEARCH FOR VEGETABLE FOOD
7756-84187-0005 HE WAS AS EAGER TOO WHEN THE DOCTOR LED EXCURSIONS INTO GULLY AND UP HILL SIDES OF A PART OF THE WORLD THAT SEEMED TO THE ADVENTURERS AS IF IT HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN TRODDEN BY THE FOOT OF MAN
7756-84187-0006 AND READY TO POINT OUT FRESH FLOWERS OR INDICATIONS OF METAL OR OTHER MINERALS WHERE THE CLIFF WAS BARED OR SPLINTERED BY SOME FALL FROM ABOVE BUT OVER THE CAMP FIRE AT NIGHT IN SOME ROCKY NOOK OR BENEATH THE SPREADING BOUGHS OF A GIGANTIC SPRUCE FIR
7756-84187-0007 A HINT OR A WORD OR TWO BROUGHT HIM BACK TO THE PRIME MOTIVE OF THEIR JOURNEY I'M READY WHEN YOU ARE GENTLEMEN HE CRIED I DON'T SAY THIS ISN'T GRAND
7756-84187-0008 AS HAPPY AS THE DAY IS LONG IN A PLACE LIKE THIS BUT WE DIDN'T COME OUT HERE ONLY TO ENJOY A HUNTING PARTY THERE'S THAT MAP YOU KNOW YES SAID THE DOCTOR GRAVELY THERE'S THE MAP BUT YOU DON'T THINK THIS IS A LIKELY PART OF THE COUNTRY NOT DOWN HERE SIR
7756-84187-0009 BUT FROM WHERE WE STOOD TO DAY AFTER STALKING THOSE BIRDS I COULD SEE THE MOUNTAINS OPENING OUT IN GULCH AND RIFT AND HOLLOW BEYOND WHICH THERE WAS PEAK AND POINT AND PASS THAT LOOKED AS MUCH LIKE THE SORT OF COUNTRY AS COULD BE
7756-84187-0010 AND I ADDED WILTON IT'S MADE ME LONG TO BEGIN EXPLORING AGAIN FOR THERE WAS NO SIGN OF DESERT THAT I COULD SEE IT'S A GRAND COUNTRY SAID BOURNE AND THE WONDER TO ME IS THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN SETTLED WHY DO YOU LAUGH BOY
7756-84187-0011 WHAT WAS IT THAT THE SALT PLAINS WERE ENOUGH TO KEEP ANYBODY FROM COMING AS FAR AS THIS THAT'S IT MY LAD SAID GRIGGS MEN MAY HAVE COME PROSPECTING IN THIS DIRECTION FOR GOLD
7756-84187-0012 BUT I SHOULDN'T BE A BIT SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THIS IS ONLY A PATCH OF GOOD LAND ROUND AND ABOUT THESE MOUNTAINS AND THAT IF WE WENT FAR ENOUGH IN ANY DIRECTION WE SHOULD COME TO THE SALT PLAINS AGAIN SHUTTING IT IN AND KEEPING PEOPLE BACK
7756-84187-0013 IT IS POSSIBLE SAID THE DOCTOR IT'S MORE THAN LIKELY SIR IF IT WERE NOT SO WOULDN'T PEOPLE HAVE SETTLED HERE IT IS VERY FAR FROM CIVILISATION GRIGGS SAID BOURNE MOST NEW PLACES ARE FAR FROM CIVILISATION SIR
7756-84187-0014 CRIED GRIGGS BUT LOOK ALL ROUND HERE SIR IF A GOOD STRONG PARTY OF MEN CAME HERE WITH THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEY'D MAKE THEIR OWN CIVILISATION FOR IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE CAN FIND HERE ALREADY PRETTY WELL EVERYTHING A MAN COULD WANT
7756-84187-0015 SEE WHAT IT WOULD BE AFTER A FEW YEARS OF FARM STOCK REARING AND GARDENING THEN WHY NOT STOP AND SETTLE HERE SAID THE DOCTOR SMILING BECAUSE WE'VE GOT GOLD ON THE BRAIN SIR REPLIED GRIGGS GRIMLY
7756-84187-0016 AND HAVING STARTED I SAY LET'S CARRY OUT OUR WORK IF WE DON'T FIND OUT THAT HIS MAP TOLD THE TRUTH I'M READY TO COME AND OPEN OUT THIS BIT OF COUNTRY IF YOU LIKE FOR IT'S TEN TIMES THE PLACE THAT WE CAME FROM EVEN NOW IF YOU SAY WE'LL GO NO FURTHER
7756-84187-0017 I'LL SET TO WORK WITH YOU BUT BECAUSE IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL OUGHT WE TO FORGET HOW WE'RE CUTTING OURSELVES OFF FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD NO SAID THE DOCTOR EMPHATICALLY I PROPOSE WE MAKE A FRESH START TO MORROW
7756-84187-0018 AND SEE WHAT THERE IS YONDER THERE WAS A MURMUR OF AGREEMENT AT THIS IN WHICH THE BOYS JOINED YES SAID CHRIS AS HE SAUNTERED AWAY SOON AFTER WITH HIS EYES ROAMING IN EVERY DIRECTION IN SEARCH OF DANGER OR SOMETHING NEW

7756-84187-0023 WHEN GRIGGS DECLARED THAT HE'D SEEN FLOCKS OF THOSE SHEEP RUNNING AWAY FROM PEOPLE STALKING THEM TILL THEY GOT TO THE EDGES OF THE PRECIPICES WHERE THEY COULD GO NO FARTHER AND THEN JUMP DOWN HEAD FIRST SO AS TO COME ON THE GREAT THICK TWISTED HORNS WHICH COVER THEIR FOREHEADS
7756-84187-0024 AND BOUNCE UP AGAIN AND GO ON RUNNING ALONG A LOWER PART YES I SAW WHY A BIG HEAVY SHEEP IF HE CAME DOWN LIKE THAT WOULD BREAK HIS HORNS BREAK HIS HORNS CRIED NED HE'D BREAK HIS NECK
