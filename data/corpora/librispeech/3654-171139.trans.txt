3654-171139-0000 AND OPENED A BROAD WAY FOR THE ARMY ON THE FIFTH DAY WHICH WAS THE TWENTY FIRST OF THE MONTH ARTEMISIUS JYAR JOSEPHUS PREVENTED HIM AND CAME FROM TIBERIAS AND WENT INTO JOTAPATA AND RAISED THE DROOPING SPIRITS OF THE JEWS
3654-171139-0001 AND A CERTAIN DESERTER TOLD THIS GOOD NEWS TO VESPASIAN THAT JOSEPHUS HAD REMOVED HIMSELF THITHER WHICH MADE HIM MAKE HASTE TO THE CITY AS SUPPOSING THAT WITH TAKING THAT HE SHOULD TAKE ALL JUDEA IN CASE HE COULD BUT WITHAL GET JOSEPHUS UNDER HIS POWER
3654-171139-0002 SO HE TOOK THIS NEWS TO BE OF THE VASTEST ADVANTAGE TO HIM AND BELIEVED IT TO BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD THAT HE WHO APPEARED TO BE THE MOST PRUDENT MAN OF ALL THEIR ENEMIES HAD OF HIS OWN ACCORD SHUT HIMSELF UP IN A PLACE OF SURE CUSTODY
3654-171139-0003 AND BY MARCHING TILL LATE IN THE EVENING ARRIVED THEN AT JOTAPATA AND BRINGING HIS ARMY TO THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THE CITY HE PITCHED HIS CAMP ON A CERTAIN SMALL HILL WHICH WAS SEVEN FURLONGS FROM THE CITY AND STILL GREATLY ENDEAVORED TO BE WELL SEEN BY THE ENEMY TO PUT THEM INTO A CONSTERNATION
3654-171139-0004 WHICH WAS INDEED SO TERRIBLE TO THE JEWS IMMEDIATELY THAT NO ONE OF THEM DURST GO OUT BEYOND THE WALL YET DID THE ROMANS PUT OFF THE ATTACK AT THAT TIME BECAUSE THEY HAD MARCHED ALL THE DAY ALTHOUGH THEY PLACED A DOUBLE ROW OF BATTALIONS ROUND THE CITY
3654-171139-0005 AND MET THEM AS HAVING FORMED THEMSELVES A CAMP BEFORE THE CITY WALLS BUT WHEN VESPASIAN HAD SET AGAINST THEM THE ARCHERS AND SLINGERS AND THE WHOLE MULTITUDE THAT COULD THROW TO A GREAT DISTANCE HE PERMITTED THEM TO GO TO WORK WHILE HE HIMSELF WITH THE FOOTMEN
3654-171139-0006 GOT UPON AN ACCLIVITY WHENCE THE CITY MIGHT EASILY BE TAKEN JOSEPHUS WAS THEN IN FEAR FOR THE CITY AND LEAPED OUT AND ALL THE JEWISH MULTITUDE WITH HIM
3654-171139-0007 THESE FELL TOGETHER UPON THE ROMANS IN GREAT NUMBERS AND DROVE THEM AWAY FROM THE WALL AND PERFORMED A GREAT MANY GLORIOUS AND BOLD ACTIONS YET DID THEY SUFFER AS MUCH AS THEY MADE THE ENEMY SUFFER
3654-171139-0008 FOR AS DESPAIR OF DELIVERANCE ENCOURAGED THE JEWS SO DID A SENSE OF SHAME EQUALLY ENCOURAGE THE ROMANS THESE LAST HAD SKILL AS WELL AS STRENGTH THE OTHER HAD ONLY COURAGE WHICH ARMED THEM AND MADE THEM FIGHT FURIOUSLY
3654-171139-0009 AND WHEN THE FIGHT HAD LASTED ALL DAY IT WAS PUT AN END TO BY THE COMING ON OF THE NIGHT
3654-171139-0010 THUS DID THE ROMANS TRY TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION UPON THE JEWS TILL THE FIFTH DAY CONTINUALLY WHILE THE PEOPLE OF JOTAPATA MADE SALLIES OUT AND FOUGHT AT THE WALLS MOST DESPERATELY NOR WERE THE JEWS AFFRIGHTED AT THE STRENGTH OF THE ENEMY
3654-171139-0011 IT IS ONLY TO BE COME AT ON THE NORTH SIDE WHERE THE UTMOST PART OF THE CITY IS BUILT ON THE MOUNTAIN AS IT ENDS OBLIQUELY AT A PLAIN THIS MOUNTAIN JOSEPHUS HAD ENCOMPASSED WITH A WALL WHEN HE FORTIFIED THE CITY
3654-171139-0012 THAT ITS TOP MIGHT NOT BE CAPABLE OF BEING SEIZED UPON BY THE ENEMIES
3654-171139-0013 AS WELL AS THE BOLD DEFENSE OF THE JEWS MADE A RESOLUTION TO PROSECUTE THE SIEGE WITH VIGOR TO THAT END HE CALLED THE COMMANDERS THAT WERE UNDER HIM TO A COUNCIL OF WAR AND CONSULTED WITH THEM WHICH WAY THE ASSAULT MIGHT BE MANAGED TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE
3654-171139-0014 AND WHEN THE RESOLUTION WAS THERE TAKEN TO RAISE A BANK AGAINST THAT PART OF THE WALL WHICH WAS PRACTICABLE HE SENT HIS WHOLE ARMY ABROAD TO GET THE MATERIALS TOGETHER
3654-171139-0015 BESIDES THE WOOD THEY HAD CUT DOWN SOME OF THEM BROUGHT HURDLES IN ORDER TO AVOID THE EFFECTS OF THE DARTS THAT WERE SHOT FROM ABOVE THEM THESE HURDLES THEY SPREAD OVER THEIR BANKS
3654-171139-0016 UNDER COVER WHEREOF THEY FORMED THEIR BANK AND SO WERE LITTLE OR NOTHING HURT BY THE DARTS THAT WERE THROWN UPON THEM FROM THE WALL WHILE OTHERS PULLED THE NEIGHBORING HILLOCKS TO PIECES AND PERPETUALLY BROUGHT EARTH TO THEM
3654-171139-0017 SO THAT WHILE THEY WERE BUSY THREE SORTS OF WAYS NOBODY WAS IDLE HOWEVER THE JEWS CAST GREAT STONES FROM THE WALLS UPON THE HURDLES WHICH PROTECTED THE MEN WITH ALL SORTS OF DARTS ALSO AND THE NOISE OF WHAT COULD NOT REACH THEM WAS YET SO TERRIBLE
3654-171139-0018 AT THE SAME TIME SUCH ENGINES AS WERE INTENDED FOR THAT PURPOSE THREW AT ONCE LANCES UPON THEM WITH A GREAT NOISE
3654-171139-0019 TOGETHER WITH FIRE AND A VAST MULTITUDE OF ARROWS WHICH MADE THE WALL SO DANGEROUS THAT THE JEWS DURST NOT ONLY NOT COME UPON IT BUT DURST NOT COME TO THOSE PARTS WITHIN THE WALLS WHICH WERE REACHED BY THE ENGINES
3654-171139-0020 WHEN THEY COULD NOT THROW AT THE ROMANS FROM A HIGHER PLACE FOR THEY THEN MADE SALLIES OUT OF THE CITY LIKE PRIVATE ROBBERS BY PARTIES AND PULLED AWAY THE HURDLES THAT COVERED THE WORKMEN AND KILLED THEM WHEN THEY WERE THUS NAKED AND WHEN THOSE WORKMEN GAVE WAY
3654-171139-0021 THESE CAST AWAY THE EARTH THAT COMPOSED THE BANK AND BURNT THE WOODEN PARTS OF IT TOGETHER WITH THE HURDLES
3654-171139-0022 TILL AT LENGTH VESPASIAN PERCEIVED THAT THE INTERVALS THERE WERE BETWEEN THE WORKS WERE OF DISADVANTAGE TO HIM FOR THOSE SPACES OF GROUND AFFORDED THE JEWS A PLACE FOR ASSAULTING THE ROMANS SO HE UNITED THE HURDLES AND AT THE SAME TIME JOINED ONE PART OF THE ARMY TO THE OTHER
3654-171139-0023 AND BROUGHT NEARER THAN EVER TO THE BATTLEMENTS THAT BELONGED TO THE WALLS JOSEPHUS THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY WRONG IN HIM IF HE COULD MAKE NO CONTRIVANCES IN OPPOSITION TO THEIRS
3654-171139-0024 HE INVENTED THIS SORT OF COVER FOR THEM
3654-171139-0025 AND THE FIRE THAT WAS THROWN WOULD BE QUENCHED BY THE MOISTURE THAT WAS IN THEM AND THESE HE SET BEFORE THE WORKMEN AND UNDER THEM THESE WORKMEN WENT ON WITH THEIR WORKS IN SAFETY
3654-171139-0026 HE ALSO BUILT A GOOD NUMBER OF TOWERS UPON THE WALL AND FITTED IT TO STRONG BATTLEMENTS
