1806-143946-0001 FEW MEN EXHIBIT GREATER DIVERSITY OR IF WE MAY SO EXPRESS IT GREATER ANTITHESIS OF CHARACTER THAN THE NATIVE WARRIOR OF NORTH AMERICA IN WAR HE IS DARING
1806-143946-0002 MODEST AND COMMONLY CHASTE THESE ARE QUALITIES IT IS TRUE WHICH DO NOT DISTINGUISH ALL ALIKE BUT THEY ARE SO FAR THE PREDOMINATING TRAITS OF THESE REMARKABLE PEOPLE
1806-143946-0003 AS TO BE CHARACTERISTIC IT IS GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT THE ABORIGINES OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT HAVE AN ASIATIC ORIGIN THERE ARE MANY PHYSICAL AS WELL AS MORAL FACTS WHICH CORROBORATE THIS OPINION
1806-143946-0004 THE IMAGERY OF THE INDIAN BOTH IN HIS POETRY
1806-143946-0005 IS ORIENTAL CHASTENED AND PERHAPS IMPROVED BY THE LIMITED RANGE OF HIS PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE HE DRAWS HIS METAPHORS FROM THE CLOUDS THE SEASONS THE BIRDS THE BEASTS
1806-143946-0006 AND THE VEGETABLE WORLD IN THIS PERHAPS HE DOES NO MORE THAN ANY OTHER ENERGETIC AND IMAGINATIVE RACE WOULD DO BEING COMPELLED TO SET BOUNDS TO FANCY BY EXPERIENCE BUT
1806-143946-0007 THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN CLOTHES HIS IDEAS IN A DRESS WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE AFRICAN AND IS ORIENTAL IN ITSELF HIS LANGUAGE
1806-143946-0008 HAS THE RICHNESS AND SENTENTIOUS FULLNESS OF THE CHINESE HE WILL EXPRESS A PHRASE IN A WORD AND HE WILL QUALIFY THE MEANING OF AN ENTIRE SENTENCE BY A SYLLABLE
1806-143946-0009 HE WILL EVEN CONVEY DIFFERENT SIGNIFICATIONS BY THE SIMPLEST INFLECTIONS OF THE VOICE PHILOLOGISTS HAVE SAID THAT THERE ARE BUT TWO OR THREE LANGUAGES PROPERLY SPEAKING
1806-143946-0010 AND SEEMINGLY CONVERSED MUCH TOGETHER YET ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT OF THE INTERPRETER EACH WAS ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT OF WHAT THE OTHER SAID
1806-143946-0011 IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THEY ARE NOW SO DISTINCT IN THEIR WORDS AS TO POSSESS MOST OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF STRANGE LANGUAGES HENCE MUCH OF THE EMBARRASSMENT THAT HAS ARISEN IN LEARNING THEIR HISTORIES
1806-143946-0012 AND MOST OF THE UNCERTAINTY WHICH EXISTS IN THEIR TRADITIONS LIKE NATIONS OF HIGHER PRETENSIONS THE AMERICAN INDIAN GIVES A VERY DIFFERENT ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN TRIBE OR RACE FROM THAT WHICH IS GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
1806-143946-0013 WHICH MAY POSSIBLY BE THOUGHT CORROBORATIVE OF THE MOSAIC ACCOUNT OF THE CREATION THE WHITES HAVE ASSISTED GREATLY IN RENDERING THE TRADITIONS OF THE ABORIGINES MORE OBSCURE BY THEIR OWN MANNER OF CORRUPTING NAMES
1806-143946-0014 THUS THE TERM USED IN THE TITLE OF THIS BOOK HAS UNDERGONE THE CHANGES OF MAHICANNI MOHICANS AND MOHEGANS THE LATTER BEING THE WORD COMMONLY USED BY THE WHITES
1806-143946-0015 THAT THE INDIANS NOT ONLY GAVE DIFFERENT NAMES TO THEIR ENEMIES BUT FREQUENTLY TO THEMSELVES THE CAUSE OF THE CONFUSION WILL BE UNDERSTOOD IN THESE PAGES
1806-143946-0016 DELAWARES WAPANACHKI AND MOHICANS ALL MEAN THE SAME PEOPLE OR TRIBES OF THE SAME STOCK
1806-143946-0017 THE MAQUAS THE MINGOES AND THE IROQUOIS THOUGH NOT ALL STRICTLY THE SAME ARE IDENTIFIED FREQUENTLY BY THE SPEAKERS BEING POLITICALLY CONFEDERATED AND OPPOSED TO THOSE JUST NAMED MINGO
1806-143946-0018 THE MOHICANS WERE THE POSSESSORS OF THE COUNTRY FIRST OCCUPIED BY THE EUROPEANS IN THIS PORTION OF THE CONTINENT THEY WERE CONSEQUENTLY THE FIRST DISPOSSESSED

1806-143946-0023 WHILE WRITING THIS BOOK FULLY A QUARTER OF A CENTURY SINCE IT OCCURRED TO US THAT THE FRENCH NAME OF THIS LAKE WAS TOO COMPLICATED THE AMERICAN TOO COMMONPLACE AND THE INDIAN TOO UNPRONOUNCEABLE
1806-143946-0024 FOR EITHER TO BE USED FAMILIARLY IN A WORK OF FICTION LOOKING OVER AN ANCIENT MAP IT WAS ASCERTAINED THAT A TRIBE OF INDIANS CALLED LES HORICANS BY THE FRENCH
1806-143946-0025 EXISTED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIS BEAUTIFUL SHEET OF WATER AS EVERY WORD UTTERED BY NATTY BUMPPO WAS NOT TO BE RECEIVED AS RIGID TRUTH WE TOOK THE LIBERTY OF PUTTING THE HORICAN INTO HIS MOUTH
