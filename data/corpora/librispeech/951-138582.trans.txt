951-138582-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN FRUIT PIECE FOR NEVER ANY THING CAN BE AMISS WHEN SIMPLENESS AND DUTY TENDER IT
951-138582-0001 MISTER THORNTON WENT STRAIGHT AND CLEAR INTO ALL THE INTERESTS OF THE FOLLOWING DAY THERE WAS A SLIGHT DEMAND FOR FINISHED GOODS AND AS IT AFFECTED HIS BRANCH OF THE TRADE HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT AND DROVE HARD BARGAINS
951-138582-0002 HE WAS SHARP TO THE HOUR AT THE MEETING OF HIS BROTHER MAGISTRATES GIVING THEM THE BEST ASSISTANCE OF HIS STRONG SENSE
951-138582-0003 AND SO COMING TO A RAPID DECISION OLDER MEN MEN OF LONG STANDING IN THE TOWN MEN OF FAR GREATER WEALTH REALISED AND TURNED INTO LAND WHILE HIS WAS ALL FLOATING CAPITAL ENGAGED IN HIS TRADE LOOKED TO HIM FOR PROMPT READY WISDOM
951-138582-0004 TO LEAD IN ALL THE REQUISITE STEPS
951-138582-0005 NO MORE THAN FOR THE SOFT WEST WIND THAT SCARCELY MADE THE SMOKE FROM THE GREAT TALL CHIMNEYS SWERVE IN ITS STRAIGHT UPWARD COURSE
951-138582-0006 IF IT HAD BEEN OTHERWISE
951-138582-0007 AS IT WAS HE LOOKED TO THE SPEEDY ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THAT ALONE IT WAS HIS MOTHER'S GREEDY EARS THAT SUCKED IN FROM THE WOMEN KIND OF THESE MAGISTRATES AND WEALTHY MEN HOW HIGHLY MISTER THIS OR MISTER THAT THOUGHT OF MISTER THORNTON THAT IF HE HAD NOT BEEN THERE
951-138582-0008 VERY BADLY INDEED HE SWEPT OFF HIS BUSINESS RIGHT AND LEFT THAT DAY IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HIS DEEP MORTIFICATION OF YESTERDAY AND THE STUNNED PURPOSELESS COURSE OF THE HOURS AFTERWARDS HAD CLEARED AWAY ALL THE MISTS FROM HIS INTELLECT
951-138582-0009 THE EVIDENCE AGAINST BOUCHER AND OTHER RINGLEADERS OF THE RIOT WAS TAKEN BEFORE HIM THAT AGAINST THE THREE OTHERS FOR CONSPIRACY FAILED
951-138582-0010 FOR THE SWIFT RIGHT ARM OF THE LAW SHOULD BE IN READINESS TO STRIKE AS SOON AS THEY COULD PROVE A FAULT AND THEN HE LEFT THE HOT REEKING ROOM IN THE BOROUGH COURT AND WENT OUT INTO THE FRESHER BUT STILL SULTRY STREET IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE GAVE WAY ALL AT ONCE
951-138582-0011 HE WAS SO LANGUID THAT HE COULD NOT CONTROL HIS THOUGHTS THEY WOULD WANDER TO HER THEY WOULD BRING BACK THE SCENE NOT OF HIS REPULSE AND REJECTION THE DAY BEFORE BUT THE LOOKS THE ACTIONS OF THE DAY BEFORE THAT HE WENT ALONG THE CROWDED STREETS
951-138582-0012 MECHANICALLY WINDING IN AND OUT AMONG THE PEOPLE BUT NEVER SEEING THEM ALMOST SICK WITH LONGING FOR THAT ONE HALF HOUR THAT ONE BRIEF SPACE OF TIME WHEN SHE CLUNG TO HIM AND HER HEART BEAT AGAINST HIS TO COME ONCE AGAIN
