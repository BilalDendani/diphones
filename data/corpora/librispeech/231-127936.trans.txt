231-127936-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR THE WHIP HAND SPARGO ALMOST IRRITABLE FROM DESIRE TO GET AT CLOSE GRIPS WITH THE OBJECTS OF HIS LONG JOURNEY SHOOK OFF BRETON'S HAND WITH A GROWL OF RESENTMENT
231-127936-0001 AND HOW ON EARTH CAN I WASTE TIME GUESSING HE EXCLAIMED WHO IS HE BRETON LAUGHED SOFTLY STEADY SPARGO STEADY HE SAID IT'S MYERST THE SAFE DEPOSIT MAN MYERST
231-127936-0002 SPARGO STARTED AS IF SOMETHING HAD BITTEN HIM MYERST HE ALMOST SHOUTED MYERST GOOD LORD WHY DID I NEVER THINK OF HIM MYERST THEN I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF HIM SAID BRETON BUT
231-127936-0003 HE'S THERE SPARGO TOOK A STEP TOWARDS THE COTTAGE BRETON PULLED HIM BACK WAIT HE SAID WE'VE GOT TO DISCUSS THIS I'D BETTER TELL YOU WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHAT ARE THEY DOING THEN DEMANDED SPARGO IMPATIENTLY
231-127936-0004 WELL ANSWERED BRETON THEY'RE GOING THROUGH A QUANTITY OF PAPERS THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN LOOK VERY ILL AND VERY MISERABLE MYERST IS EVIDENTLY LAYING DOWN THE LAW TO THEM IN SOME FASHION OR OTHER I'VE FORMED A NOTION SPARGO
231-127936-0005 WHAT NOTION MYERST IS IN POSSESSION OF WHATEVER SECRET THEY HAVE AND HE'S FOLLOWED THEM DOWN HERE TO BLACKMAIL THEM THAT'S MY NOTION SPARGO THOUGHT AWHILE PACING UP AND DOWN THE RIVER BANK
231-127936-0006 I DARESAY YOU'RE RIGHT HE SAID NOW WHAT'S TO BE DONE BRETON TOO CONSIDERED MATTERS I WISH HE SAID AT LAST I WISH WE COULD GET IN THERE AND OVERHEAR WHAT'S GOING ON
231-127936-0007 BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE I KNOW THAT COTTAGE THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO IS THIS WE MUST CATCH MYERST UNAWARES HE'S HERE FOR NO GOOD LOOK HERE
231-127936-0008 AND REACHING ROUND TO HIS HIP POCKET BRETON DREW OUT A BROWNING REVOLVER AND WAGGED IT IN HIS HAND WITH A SMILE THAT'S A USEFUL THING TO HAVE SPARGO HE REMARKED I SLIPPED IT INTO MY POCKET THE OTHER DAY WONDERING WHY ON EARTH I DID IT
231-127936-0009 NOW IT'LL COME IN HANDY FOR ANYTHING WE KNOW MYERST MAY BE ARMED WELL SAID SPARGO COME UP TO THE COTTAGE IF THINGS TURN OUT AS I THINK THEY WILL MYERST WHEN HE'S GOT WHAT HE WANTS WILL BE OFF
231-127936-0010 NOW YOU SHALL GET WHERE I DID JUST NOW BEHIND THAT BUSH AND I'LL STATION MYSELF IN THE DOORWAY YOU CAN REPORT TO ME AND WHEN MYERST COMES OUT I'LL COVER HIM COME ON SPARGO IT'S BEGINNING TO GET LIGHT ALREADY
231-127936-0011 BRETON CAUTIOUSLY LED THE WAY ALONG THE RIVER BANK MAKING USE OF SUCH COVER AS THE WILLOWS AND ALDERS AFFORDED TOGETHER HE AND SPARGO MADE THEIR WAY TO THE FRONT OF THE COTTAGE ARRIVED AT THE DOOR
231-127936-0012 BRETON POSTED HIMSELF IN THE PORCH MOTIONING TO SPARGO TO CREEP IN BEHIND THE BUSHES AND TO LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW AND SPARGO NOISELESSLY FOLLOWED HIS DIRECTIONS AND SLIGHTLY PARTING THE BRANCHES WHICH CONCEALED HIM LOOKED IN THROUGH THE UNCURTAINED GLASS
231-127936-0013 THE INTERIOR INTO WHICH HE LOOKED WAS ROUGH AND COMFORTLESS IN THE EXTREME THERE WERE THE BARE ACCESSORIES OF A MOORLAND COTTAGE ROUGH CHAIRS AND TABLES PLASTERED WALLS A FISHING ROD OR TWO PILED IN A CORNER SOME FOOD SET OUT ON A SIDE TABLE
231-127936-0014 AT THE TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR THE THREE MEN SAT CARDLESTONE'S FACE WAS IN THE SHADOW MYERST HAD HIS BACK TO THE WINDOW OLD ELPHICK BENDING OVER THE TABLE WAS LABORIOUSLY WRITING WITH SHAKING FINGERS
231-127936-0015 AND SPARGO TWISTED HIS HEAD ROUND TO HIS COMPANION ELPHICK HE SAID IS WRITING A CHEQUE MYERST HAS ANOTHER CHEQUE IN HIS HAND BE READY WHEN HE GETS THAT SECOND CHEQUE I GUESS HE'LL BE OFF BRETON SMILED GRIMLY AND NODDED
231-127936-0016 A MOMENT LATER SPARGO WHISPERED AGAIN LOOK OUT BRETON HE'S COMING BRETON DREW BACK INTO THE ANGLE OF THE PORCH SPARGO QUITTED HIS PROTECTING BUSH AND TOOK THE OTHER ANGLE THE DOOR OPENED
231-127936-0017 AND THEY HEARD MYERST'S VOICE THREATENING COMMANDING IN TONE NOW REMEMBER ALL I'VE SAID AND DON'T YOU FORGET I'VE THE WHIP HAND OF BOTH OF YOU THE WHIP HAND
231-127936-0018 THEN MYERST TURNED AND STEPPED OUT INTO THE GREY LIGHT TO FIND HIMSELF CONFRONTED BY AN ATHLETIC YOUNG MAN WHO HELD THE MUZZLE OF AN UGLY REVOLVER WITHIN TWO INCHES OF THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE AND IN A REMARKABLY FIRM AND STEADY GRIP
231-127936-0019 ANOTHER GLANCE SHOWED HIM THE FIGURE OF A SECOND BUSINESS LIKE LOOKING YOUNG MAN AT HIS SIDE WHOSE ATTITUDE SHOWED A DESIRE TO GRAPPLE WITH HIM GOOD MORNING MISTER MYERST SAID BRETON WITH COLD AND IRONIC POLITENESS
231-127936-0020 WE ARE GLAD TO MEET YOU SO UNEXPECTEDLY AND I MUST TROUBLE YOU TO PUT UP YOUR HANDS QUICK MYERST MADE ONE HURRIED MOVEMENT OF HIS RIGHT HAND TOWARDS HIS HIP BUT A SUDDEN GROWL FROM BRETON MADE HIM SHIFT IT JUST AS QUICKLY ABOVE HIS HEAD
231-127936-0021 WHITHER THE LEFT FOLLOWED IT BRETON LAUGHED SOFTLY THAT'S WISE MISTER MYERST HE SAID KEEPING HIS REVOLVER STEADILY POINTED AT HIS PRISONER'S NOSE DISCRETION WILL CERTAINLY BE THE BETTER PART OF YOUR VALOUR ON THIS OCCASION SPARGO

231-127936-0023 THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING CONSIDERING THAT SPARGO HAD NEVER GONE THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF SEARCHING A MAN BEFORE HE MADE SHARP AND CREDITABLE WORK OF SEEING WHAT THE PRISONER CARRIED
231-127936-0024 AND HE FORTHWITH DREW OUT AND EXHIBITED A REVOLVER WHILE MYERST FINDING HIS TONGUE CURSED THEM BOTH HEARTILY AND WITH PROFUSION EXCELLENT SAID BRETON LAUGHING AGAIN SURE HE'S GOT NOTHING ELSE ON HIM THAT'S DANGEROUS SPARGO

231-127936-0030 HE KEPT MYERST COVERED WHILE SPARGO MADE PLAY WITH THE ROPE DON'T BE AFRAID OF HURTING HIM SPARGO HE SAID TIE HIM WELL AND STRONG HE WON'T SHIFT THAT CHAIR IN A HURRY
231-127936-0031 SPARGO SPLICED HIS MAN TO THE CHAIR IN A FASHION THAT WOULD HAVE DONE CREDIT TO A SAILOR HE LEFT MYERST LITERALLY UNABLE TO MOVE EITHER HAND OR FOOT AND MYERST CURSED HIM FROM CROWN TO HEEL FOR HIS PAINS
231-127936-0032 THAT'LL DO SAID BRETON AT LAST HE DROPPED HIS REVOLVER INTO HIS POCKET AND TURNED TO THE TWO OLD MEN ELPHICK AVERTED HIS EYES AND SANK INTO A CHAIR IN THE DARKEST CORNER OF THE ROOM
