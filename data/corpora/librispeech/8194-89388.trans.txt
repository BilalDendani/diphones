8194-89388-0000 GASTON AND THE HORROR AND RESOLUTION IN HIS EYES THE CONVULSIVE WORKING OF HIS MOUTH AS HE FACED HER AT THE LAST MOMENT HER OWN DREAD NOT OF THE DEATH THAT WAS IMMINENT BUT LEST THE MERCY IT OFFERED SHOULD BE SNATCHED FROM HER
8194-89388-0001 THEN BEFORE THE VALET COULD EFFECT HIS SUPREME DEVOTION HAD COME THE HAIL OF BULLETS AND HE HAD FALLEN AGAINST HER THE BLOOD THAT POURED FROM HIS WOUNDS SATURATING HER LINEN COAT AND ROLLED OVER ACROSS HER FEET
8194-89388-0002 SHE REMEMBERED VAGUELY THE WILD FIGURES HEMMING HER IN BUT NOTHING MORE HER EYES WERE STILL SHUT A LEADEN WEIGHT SEEMED FIXED ON THEM AND THE EFFORT TO OPEN THEM WAS BEYOND HER STRENGTH
8194-89388-0003 GASTON SHE WHISPERED FEEBLY AND STRETCHED OUT HER HAND BUT INSTEAD OF HIS BODY OR THE DRY HOT SAND HER FINGERS HAD EXPECTED TO ENCOUNTER THEY CLOSED OVER SOFT CUSHIONS
8194-89388-0004 AND WITH THE SHOCK SHE SAT UP WITH A JERK HER EYES STARING WIDE BUT SICK AND FAINT SHE FELL BACK AGAIN HER ARM FLUNG ACROSS HER FACE SHIELDING THE LIGHT THAT PIERCED LIKE DAGGERS THROUGH HER THROBBING EYE BALLS
8194-89388-0005 THE DESIRE TO KNOW WHERE SHE WAS AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED MADE HER FORGET HER BRUISED BODY SHE MOVED HER ARM SLIGHTLY FROM BEFORE HER EYES SO THAT SHE COULD SEE AND LOOKED CAUTIOUSLY FROM UNDER THICK LASHES SCREENED BY THE SLEEVE OF HER COAT
8194-89388-0006 SHE WAS LYING ON A PILE OF CUSHIONS IN ONE CORNER OF A SMALL TENTED APARTMENT WHICH WAS OTHERWISE BARE EXCEPT FOR THE RUG THAT COVERED THE FLOOR IN THE OPPOSITE CORNER OF THE TENT AN ARAB WOMAN CROUCHED OVER A LITTLE BRAZIER
8194-89388-0007 A LUMP CAME INTO HER THROAT AS SHE THOUGHT OF GASTON IN THOSE LAST MOMENTS ALL INEQUALITY OF RANK HAD BEEN SWEPT AWAY IN THEIR COMMON PERIL THEY HAD BEEN ONLY A WHITE MAN AND A WHITE WOMAN TOGETHER IN THEIR EXTREMITY
8194-89388-0008 IT MUST HAVE BEEN OVER HIS LIFELESS BODY THAT THEY HAD TAKEN HER HE HAD PROVED HIS FAITHFULNESS SACRIFICING HIS LIFE FOR HIS MASTER'S PLAY THING GASTON WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY DEAD
8194-89388-0009 AND SAT UP SLOWLY LOOKING AT THE ARAB WOMAN WHO HEARING HER MOVE TURNED TO GAZE AT HER INSTANTLY DIANA REALISED THAT THERE WAS NO HELP OR COMPASSION TO BE EXPECTED FROM HER
8194-89388-0010 WAS INSPIRED BY PERSONAL HATRED
8194-89388-0011 AND THE FEELING GAVE A NECESSARY SPUR TO THE COURAGE THAT WAS FAST COMING BACK TO HER SHE STARED WITH ALL THE HAUGHTINESS SHE COULD SUMMON TO HER AID SHE HAD LEARNED HER OWN POWER AMONG THE NATIVES OF INDIA THE PREVIOUS YEAR
8194-89388-0012 AND HERE IN THE DESERT THERE WAS ONLY ONE ARAB WHOSE EYES DID NOT FALL BENEATH HERS AND PRESENTLY WITH A MUTTERED WORD THE WOMAN TURNED BACK TO HER COFFEE MAKING
8194-89388-0013 DIANA'S MUSCLES RELAXED AND SHE SAT BACK EASILY ON THE CUSHIONS THE LITTLE PASSAGE OF WILLS HAD RESTORED HER CONFIDENCE IN HERSELF SHE MOVED HER HAND AND IT BRUSHED AGAINST HER JACKET
8194-89388-0014 COMING AWAY STAINED AND STICKY AND SHE NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT ALL ONE SIDE AND SLEEVE WERE SOAKED WITH BLOOD SHE RIPPED IT OFF WITH A SHUDDER AND FLUNG IT FROM HER RUBBING THE RED SMEAR FROM HER HANDS WITH A KIND OF HORROR
8194-89388-0015 THE LITTLE TENT WAS INTENSELY HOT AND THERE WAS A CLOSE PUNGENT SMELL
8194-89388-0016 AND SCRUPULOUS CLEANLINESS OF AHMED BEN HASSAN'S TENTS HER SENSITIVE LIP CURLED WITH DISGUST ALL HER INNATE FASTIDIOUSNESS IN REVOLT THE HEAT AGGRAVATED A BURNING THIRST THAT WAS PARCHING HER THROAT
8194-89388-0017 SHE GOT UP ON TO HER FEET SLOWLY AND WITH INFINITE CAUTION TO PREVENT ANY JAR THAT MIGHT START AGAIN THE THROBBING IN HER HEAD BUT THE EFFECTS OF THE BLOW WERE WEARING OFF
8194-89388-0018 IT DID NO MORE THAN THAT AND THE SICK GIDDY FEELING HAD GONE COMPLETELY SHE CROSSED THE TENT TO THE SIDE OF THE ARAB WOMAN GIVE ME SOME WATER SHE SAID IN FRENCH BUT THE WOMAN SHOOK HER HEAD WITHOUT LOOKING UP
8194-89388-0019 DIANA REPEATED THE REQUEST IN ARABIC ONE OF THE FEW SENTENCES SHE KNEW WITHOUT STUMBLING THIS TIME THE WOMAN ROSE UP HASTILY AND HELD OUT A CUP OF THE COFFEE SHE HAD BEEN MAKING DIANA HATED THE SWEET THICK STUFF
8194-89388-0020 A SUDDEN SUSPICION SHOT THROUGH HER MIND THE COFFEE WAS DRUGGED WHAT BEYOND THE WOMAN'S EXPRESSION MADE HER THINK SO SHE DID NOT KNOW BUT SHE WAS SURE OF IT SHE PUT THE CUP ASIDE IMPATIENTLY
8194-89388-0021 NO NOT COFFEE WATER SHE SAID FIRMLY BEFORE SHE REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING THE WOMAN THRUST A STRONG ARM ROUND HER AND FORCED THE CUP TO HER LIPS
8194-89388-0022 GIGANTIC NUBIAN CAME IN WITH OUTSTRETCHED HAND SHAKING WITH RAGE POINTING AT DIANA SHE BURST INTO VOLUBLE ABUSE PUNCTUATING EVERY FEW WORDS WITH THE SHRIEKS THAT HAD BROUGHT THE NEGRO
8194-89388-0023 WITH DENUNCIATORY FIST HE PICKED UP THE LAST REMAINING EMBERS THAT HAD SCATTERED ON THE RUG RUBBING THE SMOULDERING PATCHES TILL THEY WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THEN TURNED TO LEAVE THE ROOM BUT DIANA CALLED HIM BACK
8194-89388-0024 WITH A WIDER GRIN THE NEGRO MADE A GESTURE OF ACQUIESCENCE AND WENT OUT RETURNING IN A FEW MOMENTS WITH A WATER SKIN THE THOUGHT OF ITS CONDITION MADE HER HESITATE FOR A MOMENT BUT ONLY FOR A MOMENT
8194-89388-0025 BUT SHE NEEDED IT TOO MUCH TO MIND IN SPITE OF BEING TEPID IT RELIEVED THE DRY SUFFOCATING FEELING IN HER THROAT AND REFRESHED HER THE NUBIAN WENT AWAY AGAIN LEAVING THE WOMAN STILL CROUCHING OVER THE BRAZIER
8194-89388-0026 DIANA WALKED BACK TO THE CUSHIONS AND DROPPED DOWN ON TO THEM GLADLY THE EVENTS OF THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HAD TRIED HER MORE THAN SHE REALISED HER LEGS WERE SHAKING UNDER HER AND SHE WAS THANKFUL TO SIT DOWN
8194-89388-0027 FURTHER RESTORING HER CONFIDENCE IN HERSELF HER POSITION WAS AN APPALLING ONE BUT HOPE WAS STRONG WITHIN HER
8194-89388-0028 SHE HAD SEEN ONLY THE WOMAN AND THE NUBIAN SEEMED TO ARGUE THAT IBRAHEIM OMAIR MUST BE ABSENT FROM HIS CAMP THE THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT PURPOSELY BE DELAYING THE MOMENT OF INSPECTING HIS CAPTIVE
8194-89388-0029 IT HAD BEEN EARLY AFTERNOON THEN NOW THE LIGHTED LAMP TOLD HER IT WAS NIGHT HOW LATE SHE DID NOT KNOW HER WATCH HAD BEEN BROKEN SOME MONTHS BEFORE
8194-89388-0030 AND SHE HAD NO MEANS OF EVEN GUESSING THE HOUR BUT IT MUST BE WELL ON IN THE EVENING BY NOW THE ABSENCE OF HERSELF AND GASTON AND THEIR ESCORT WOULD BE DISCOVERED HE WOULD KNOW HER PERIL AND HE WOULD COME TO HER
8194-89388-0031 OF THAT SHE HAD NO DOUBT ALTHOUGH HE HAD CHANGED SO STRANGELY IN THE LAST FEW DAYS
8194-89388-0032 STILL SHE NEVER DOUBTED EVEN IF DESIRE HAD PASSED AND INDIFFERENCE HAD BECOME SO GREAT THAT SHE WAS NO LONGER NECESSARY TO HIM STILL
8194-89388-0033 THE ORIENTAL JEALOUSY WITH WHICH HE WAS SO DEEPLY IMBUED WOULD NEVER ALLOW HIM TO LET HER PASS SO LIGHTLY FROM HIS KEEPING HE MIGHT DISCARD HER AT HIS OWN PLEASURE
8194-89388-0034 AN INCONSISTENT JEALOUSY THAT HAD BEEN UNPROVOKED AND UNJUSTIFIED BUT FOR WHICH SHE HAD SUFFERED SHE HAD KNOWN LAST NIGHT WHEN SHE WINCED UNDER HIS SARCASTIC TONGUE AND LATER WHEN SAINT HUBERT HAD LEFT THEM
8194-89388-0035 AND HIS TEMPER HAD SUDDENLY BOILED OVER THAT SHE WAS PAYING FOR THE UNACCUSTOMED STRAIN THAT HE WAS PUTTING ON HIS OWN FEELINGS HIS CURSES HAD EATEN INTO HER HEART AND SHE HAD FLED FROM HIM TO STIFLE THE COWARD INSTINCT
8194-89388-0036 THE USUAL CIGARETTE BETWEEN HIS LIPS INDIFFERENCE HAD TAKEN THE PLACE OF RAGE AND HE HAD IGNORED HER AS SHE HAD GROWN USED TO BEING IGNORED AND LONG AFTER SHE KNEW FROM HIS EVEN BREATHING THAT HE WAS ASLEEP
8194-89388-0037 SHE HAD LAIN WIDE EYED BESIDE HIM GRASPING AT WHAT HAPPINESS SHE COULD LIVING FOR THE MOMENT AS SHE HAD SCHOOLED HERSELF TO LIVE TRYING TO BE CONTENT WITH JUST THE FACT OF HIS NEARNESS
8194-89388-0038 AND THE INDIFFERENCE OF THE NIGHT HAD BEEN MAINTAINED WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER AT DAWN HIS PERSISTENT SILENCE POINTING THE CONTINUANCE OF HIS DISPLEASURE BUT HE WOULD COME
8194-89388-0039 HE WOULD NOT LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO HER EVERY MOMENT THAT IBRAHEIM OMAIR STAYED AWAY WAS SO MUCH GAINED EVERY MOMENT HE WOULD BE COMING NEARER THE REVERSAL OF THE ROLE HE PLAYED IN HER LIFE
8194-89388-0040 BROUGHT A QUIVERING SMILE TO HER LIPS FOR THE ADVENT OF THE MAN WHO A FEW WEEKS BEFORE SHE HAD LOATHED FOR HIS BRUTAL ABDUCTION OF HERSELF SHE NOW PRAYED WITH THE DESPERATION OF DESPAIR
8194-89388-0041 HE REPRESENTED SAFETY SALVATION EVERYTHING THAT MADE LIFE WORTH LIVING A SUDDEN NOISE AND MEN'S VOICES IN THE ADJOINING ROOM SENT HER TO HER FEET WITH HEAVING BREAST AND CLENCHED HANDS
8194-89388-0042 BUT THE SHARP GUTTURAL VOICE PREDOMINATING OVER THE OTHER VOICES KILLED THE WILD HOPE THAT HAD SPRUNG UP IN HER BY ITS UTTER DISSIMILARITY TO THE SOFT LOW TONES FOR WHICH SHE LONGED IBRAHEIM
8194-89388-0043 OMAIR HE HAD COME FIRST SHE SET HER TEETH WITH A LONG SHUDDERING BREATH BRACING HERSELF TO MEET WHAT WAS COMING
8194-89388-0044 THE ARAB WOMAN TURNED TO LOOK AT HER AGAIN WITH A SNEERING SMILE THAT WAS FULL OF SIGNIFICANCE BUT BEYOND A FLEETING GLANCE OF DISDAIN DIANA PAID NO ATTENTION TO HER
8194-89388-0045 SHE STOOD RIGID ONE FOOT BEATING NERVOUSLY INTO THE SOFT RUG SHE NOTICED IRRELEVANTLY
8194-89388-0046 FROM THE CENTRE OF IMPORTANCE EVEN AT A SUPREME MOMENT SHE WONDERED WITH AN ANNOYANCE THAT SEEMED CURIOUSLY FUTILE WHY IT HAD BEEN DONE THE VOICES IN THE NEXT ROOM CONTINUED
8194-89388-0047 AND THE SAME HUGE NEGRO SHE HAD SEEN BEFORE ENTERED HE CAME TOWARDS HER AND HER BREATH HISSED IN SUDDENLY BETWEEN HER SET TEETH BUT BEFORE HE REACHED HER THE ARAB WOMAN INTERCEPTED HIM BLOCKING HIS WAY
8194-89388-0048 AND WITH WILD EYES AND PASSIONATE GESTURES POURED OUT A STREAM OF LOW FRENZIED WORDS THE NUBIAN TURNED ON HER IMPATIENTLY AND THRUST HER ROUGHLY OUT OF HIS WAY
8194-89388-0049 ONLY HER HANDS TWITCHED HER LONG FINGERS CURLING AND UNCURLING SPASMODICALLY AND SHE BURIED THEM DEEP IN HER BREECHES POCKETS TO HIDE THEM SHE WALKED SLOWLY TO THE CURTAIN AND NODDED TO THE NUBIAN TO DRAW IT ASIDE
8194-89388-0050 FOR ALL HER ATTENTION WAS FOCUSSED ON THE CENTRAL FIGURE IN THE ROOM IBRAHEIM
8194-89388-0051 LOLLING HIS GREAT BULK ON A PILE OF CUSHIONS A LITTLE INLAID STOOL WITH COFFEE BESIDE HIM AND BEHIND HIM STANDING MOTIONLESS AS IF FORMED OF BRONZE TWO OTHER NEGROES
8194-89388-0052 AND INSOLENT HALF CLOSED EYES THE HOLD SHE WAS EXERCISING OVER HERSELF WAS TREMENDOUS HER BODY WAS RIGID WITH THE EFFORT AND HER HANDS DEEP DOWN IN HER POCKETS CLENCHED TILL THE NAILS BIT INTO THE PALMS
8194-89388-0053 EVERY INSTINCT WAS REBELLING AGAINST THE CALM SHE FORCED UPON HERSELF SHE LONGED TO SCREAM AND MAKE A DASH FOR THE OPENING THAT SHE GUESSED WAS BEHIND HER AND TO TAKE HER CHANCE IN THE DARKNESS OUTSIDE
8194-89388-0054 SHOWING EVEN AGAINST HIS DARK SKIN HIS HEAVY FACE LIT UP WITH A GLEAM OF MALICIOUS SATISFACTION AS DIANA CAME TOWARDS HIM HIS LOOSE MOUTH BROADENED IN A WICKED SMILE
