1633-150458-0000 HE SENT FOR ALL HIS STEWARDS TO THE HEAD OFFICE AND EXPLAINED TO THEM HIS INTENTIONS AND WISHES HE TOLD THEM THAT STEPS WOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY TO FREE HIS SERFS AND THAT TILL THEN THEY WERE NOT TO BE OVERBURDENED WITH LABOR
1633-150458-0001 AND HOSPITALS ASYLUMS AND SCHOOLS WERE TO BE ESTABLISHED ON ALL THE ESTATES SOME OF THE STEWARDS THERE WERE SEMILITERATE FOREMEN AMONG THEM LISTENED WITH ALARM
1633-150458-0002 SUPPOSING THESE WORDS TO MEAN THAT THE YOUNG COUNT WAS DISPLEASED WITH THEIR MANAGEMENT AND EMBEZZLEMENT OF MONEY SOME AFTER THEIR FIRST FRIGHT WERE AMUSED BY PIERRE'S LISP AND THE NEW WORDS THEY HAD NOT HEARD BEFORE
1633-150458-0003 OTHERS SIMPLY ENJOYED HEARING HOW THE MASTER TALKED WHILE THE CLEVEREST AMONG THEM INCLUDING THE CHIEF STEWARD UNDERSTOOD FROM THIS SPEECH HOW THEY COULD BEST HANDLE THE MASTER FOR THEIR OWN ENDS
1633-150458-0004 THE CHIEF STEWARD EXPRESSED GREAT SYMPATHY WITH PIERRE'S INTENTIONS BUT REMARKED THAT BESIDES THESE CHANGES IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO GO INTO THE GENERAL STATE OF AFFAIRS WHICH WAS FAR FROM SATISFACTORY
1633-150458-0005 DESPITE COUNT BEZUKHOV'S ENORMOUS WEALTH SINCE HE HAD COME INTO AN INCOME WHICH WAS SAID TO AMOUNT TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND RUBLES A YEAR PIERRE FELT HIMSELF FAR POORER THAN WHEN HIS FATHER HAD MADE HIM AN ALLOWANCE OF TEN THOUSAND RUBLES
1633-150458-0006 HE HAD A DIM PERCEPTION OF THE FOLLOWING BUDGET ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND WENT IN PAYMENTS ON ALL THE ESTATES TO THE LAND BANK ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND WENT FOR THE UPKEEP OF THE ESTATE NEAR MOSCOW THE TOWN HOUSE
1633-150458-0007 AND THE ALLOWANCE TO THE THREE PRINCESSES ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND WAS GIVEN IN PENSIONS AND THE SAME AMOUNT FOR ASYLUMS
1633-150458-0008 ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND WENT FOR INTEREST ON DEBTS THE BUILDING OF A NEW CHURCH PREVIOUSLY BEGUN HAD COST ABOUT TEN THOUSAND IN EACH OF THE LAST TWO YEARS
1633-150458-0009 BESIDES THIS THE CHIEF STEWARD WROTE EVERY YEAR TELLING HIM OF FIRES AND BAD HARVESTS OR OF THE NECESSITY OF REBUILDING FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS
1633-150458-0010 THE CHIEF STEWARD PUT THE STATE OF THINGS TO HIM IN THE VERY WORST LIGHT POINTING OUT THE NECESSITY OF PAYING OFF THE DEBTS AND UNDERTAKING NEW ACTIVITIES WITH SERF LABOR TO WHICH PIERRE DID NOT AGREE
1633-150458-0011 PIERRE HAD NONE OF THE PRACTICAL PERSISTENCE THAT WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO ATTEND TO THE BUSINESS HIMSELF AND SO HE DISLIKED IT AND ONLY TRIED TO PRETEND TO THE STEWARD THAT HE WAS ATTENDING TO IT THE STEWARD FOR HIS PART
1633-150458-0012 TRIED TO PRETEND TO THE COUNT THAT HE CONSIDERED THESE CONSULTATIONS VERY VALUABLE FOR THE PROPRIETOR AND TROUBLESOME TO HIMSELF IN KIEV PIERRE FOUND SOME PEOPLE HE KNEW AND STRANGERS HASTENED TO MAKE HIS ACQUAINTANCE AND JOYFULLY WELCOMED THE RICH NEWCOMER
1633-150458-0013 THE LARGEST LANDOWNER OF THE PROVINCE TEMPTATIONS TO PIERRE'S GREATEST WEAKNESS
1633-150458-0014 WERE SO STRONG THAT HE COULD NOT RESIST THEM AGAIN WHOLE DAYS WEEKS AND MONTHS OF HIS LIFE PASSED IN AS GREAT A RUSH AND WERE AS MUCH OCCUPIED WITH EVENING PARTIES DINNERS LUNCHES AND BALLS
1633-150458-0015 GIVING HIM NO TIME FOR REFLECTION AS IN PETERSBURG INSTEAD OF THE NEW LIFE HE HAD HOPED TO LEAD HE STILL LIVED THE OLD LIFE ONLY IN NEW SURROUNDINGS
1633-150458-0016 OF THE THREE PRECEPTS OF FREEMASONRY PIERRE REALIZED THAT HE DID NOT FULFILL THE ONE WHICH ENJOINED EVERY MASON TO SET AN EXAMPLE OF MORAL LIFE AND THAT OF THE SEVEN VIRTUES HE LACKED TWO MORALITY AND THE LOVE OF DEATH
1633-150458-0017 HE CONSOLED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT HE FULFILLED ANOTHER OF THE PRECEPTS THAT OF REFORMING THE HUMAN RACE AND HAD OTHER VIRTUES LOVE OF HIS NEIGHBOR AND ESPECIALLY GENEROSITY
1633-150458-0018 AND WHOM HE INTENDED TO BENEFIT THE CHIEF STEWARD WHO CONSIDERED THE YOUNG COUNT'S ATTEMPTS ALMOST INSANE UNPROFITABLE TO HIMSELF
1633-150458-0019 MADE SOME CONCESSIONS CONTINUING TO REPRESENT THE LIBERATION OF THE SERFS AS IMPRACTICABLE HE ARRANGED FOR THE ERECTION OF LARGE BUILDINGS SCHOOLS HOSPITALS AND ASYLUMS
1633-150458-0020 ON ALL THE ESTATES BEFORE THE MASTER ARRIVED EVERYWHERE PREPARATIONS WERE MADE NOT FOR CEREMONIOUS WELCOMES WHICH HE KNEW PIERRE WOULD NOT LIKE BUT FOR JUST SUCH GRATEFULLY RELIGIOUS ONES
1633-150458-0021 WITH OFFERINGS OF ICONS AND THE BREAD AND SALT OF HOSPITALITY AS ACCORDING TO HIS UNDERSTANDING OF HIS MASTER WOULD TOUCH AND DELUDE HIM THE SOUTHERN SPRING THE COMFORTABLE RAPID TRAVELING IN A VIENNA CARRIAGE
1633-150458-0022 EVERYWHERE WERE RECEPTIONS WHICH THOUGH THEY EMBARRASSED PIERRE AWAKENED A JOYFUL FEELING IN THE DEPTH OF HIS HEART IN ONE PLACE THE PEASANTS PRESENTED HIM WITH BREAD AND SALT AND AN ICON OF SAINT PETER AND SAINT PAUL
1633-150458-0023 ASKING PERMISSION AS A MARK OF THEIR GRATITUDE FOR THE BENEFITS HE HAD CONFERRED ON THEM TO BUILD A NEW CHANTRY TO THE CHURCH AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE IN HONOR OF PETER AND PAUL HIS PATRON SAINTS IN ANOTHER PLACE
1633-150458-0024 THE WOMEN WITH INFANTS IN ARMS MET HIM TO THANK HIM FOR RELEASING THEM FROM HARD WORK ON A THIRD ESTATE THE PRIEST BEARING A CROSS CAME TO MEET HIM SURROUNDED BY CHILDREN WHOM BY THE COUNT'S GENEROSITY
1633-150458-0025 WHICH WERE SOON TO BE OPENED EVERYWHERE HE SAW THE STEWARDS ACCOUNTS ACCORDING TO WHICH THE SERFS MANORIAL LABOR HAD BEEN DIMINISHED
1633-150458-0026 THEY DID STILL HARDER WORK ON THEIR OWN LAND HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE PRIEST WHO MET HIM WITH THE CROSS OPPRESSED THE PEASANTS BY HIS EXACTIONS
1633-150458-0027 AND THAT THE PUPILS PARENTS WEPT AT HAVING TO LET HIM TAKE THEIR CHILDREN AND SECURED THEIR RELEASE BY HEAVY PAYMENTS HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE BRICK BUILDINGS BUILT TO PLAN WERE BEING BUILT BY SERFS WHOSE MANORIAL LABOR WAS THUS INCREASED
1633-150458-0028 THOUGH LESSENED ON PAPER HE DID NOT KNOW THAT WHERE THE STEWARD HAD SHOWN HIM IN THE ACCOUNTS THAT THE SERFS PAYMENTS HAD BEEN DIMINISHED BY A THIRD THEIR OBLIGATORY MANORIAL WORK HAD BEEN INCREASED BY A HALF
1633-150458-0029 HOW EASY IT IS HOW LITTLE EFFORT IT NEEDS TO DO SO MUCH GOOD THOUGHT PIERRE AND HOW LITTLE ATTENTION WE PAY TO IT HE WAS PLEASED AT THE GRATITUDE HE RECEIVED BUT FELT ABASHED AT RECEIVING IT
1633-150458-0030 THIS GRATITUDE REMINDED HIM OF HOW MUCH MORE HE MIGHT DO FOR THESE SIMPLE KINDLY PEOPLE THE CHIEF STEWARD A VERY STUPID BUT CUNNING MAN WHO SAW PERFECTLY THROUGH THE NAIVE AND INTELLIGENT COUNT AND PLAYED WITH HIM AS WITH A TOY
1633-150458-0031 SEEING THE EFFECT THESE PREARRANGED RECEPTIONS HAD ON PIERRE PRESSED HIM STILL HARDER WITH PROOFS OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY AND ABOVE ALL THE USELESSNESS OF FREEING THE SERFS WHO WERE QUITE HAPPY AS IT WAS
1633-150458-0032 PIERRE IN HIS SECRET SOUL AGREED WITH THE STEWARD THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE HAPPIER PEOPLE AND THAT GOD ONLY KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM WHEN THEY WERE FREE BUT HE INSISTED THOUGH RELUCTANTLY ON WHAT HE THOUGHT RIGHT
1633-150458-0033 THE STEWARD PROMISED TO DO ALL IN HIS POWER TO CARRY OUT THE COUNT'S WISHES SEEING CLEARLY THAT NOT ONLY WOULD THE COUNT NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND OUT WHETHER ALL MEASURES HAD BEEN TAKEN FOR THE SALE OF THE LAND AND FORESTS AND TO RELEASE THEM FROM THE LAND BANK
1633-150458-0034 BUT WOULD PROBABLY NEVER EVEN INQUIRE AND WOULD NEVER KNOW THAT THE NEWLY ERECTED BUILDINGS WERE STANDING EMPTY
