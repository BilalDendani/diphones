2589-177234-0000 GOD AND MAN MUST COMBINE FOR SALVATION FROM SIN AND THE SAME WORD HERE AND ELSEWHERE TRANSLATED REMISSION SEEMS TO BE EMPLOYED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT FOR THE SHARE OF EITHER IN THE GREAT DELIVERANCE
2589-177234-0001 BUT FIRST LET ME SAY SOMETHING CONCERNING THE WORD HERE AND EVERYWHERE TRANSLATED REPENTANCE I WOULD NOT EVEN SUGGEST A MISTRANSLATION BUT THE IDEA INTENDED BY THE WORD HAS BEEN SO MISUNDERSTOOD
2589-177234-0002 AND THEREFORE MISTAUGHT THAT IT REQUIRES SOME CONSIDERATION OF THE WORD ITSELF TO GET AT A RIGHT RECOGNITION OF THE MORAL FACT IT REPRESENTS THE GREEK WORD THEN OF WHICH THE WORD REPENTANCE IS THE ACCEPTED SYNONYM
2589-177234-0003 AND FUNDAMENTALLY THE ACCURATE RENDERING IS MADE UP OF TWO WORDS THE CONJOINT MEANING OF WHICH IS A CHANGE OF MIND OR THOUGHT THERE IS IN IT NO INTENT OF OR HINT AT SORROW OR SHAME
2589-177234-0004 OR ANY OTHER OF THE MENTAL CONDITIONS THAT NOT UNFREQUENTLY ACCOMPANYING REPENTANCE HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR ESSENTIAL PARTS OF IT SOMETIMES FOR ITS VERY ESSENCE HERE THE LAST OF THE PROPHETS
2589-177234-0005 OR THE EVANGELIST WHO RECORDS HIS DOINGS QUALIFIES THE WORD AS IF HE HELD IT INSUFFICIENT IN ITSELF TO CONVEY THE BAPTIST'S MEANING
2589-177234-0006 KAERUSSON BAPTISMA METAUOIAS EIS APHESIN AMARTION A
2589-177234-0007 ONE FORM AT LEAST OF GOD'S SENDING AWAY OF SINS NEITHER DO I SAY THAT THE TAKING OF THE PHRASE TO MEAN REPENTANCE FOR THE REMISSION OF SINS NAMELY REPENTANCE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE PARDON OF GOD INVOLVES ANY INCONSISTENCY
2589-177234-0008 THAT REACHES TO THE SENDING AWAY OR ABJUREMENT OF SINS I DO NOT THINK A CHANGE OF MIND UNTO THE REMISSION OR PARDON OF SIN WOULD BE NEARLY SO LOGICAL A PHRASE AS
2589-177234-0009 A CHANGE OF MIND UNTO THE DISMISSION OF SINNING THE REVISED VERSION REFUSES THE WORD FOR AND CHOOSES UNTO THOUGH IT RETAINS REMISSION WHICH WORD NOW CONVEYS NO MEANING EXCEPT THE FORGIVENESS OF GOD
2589-177234-0010 WITH THE DIFFERENCE OF MEANING THAT COMES FROM THE DIFFERING SOURCES OF THE ACTION BOTH GOD AND MAN SEND AWAY SINS BUT IN THE ONE CASE GOD SENDS AWAY THE SINS OF THE MAN AND IN THE OTHER
2589-177234-0011 THE MAN SENDS AWAY HIS OWN SINS I DO NOT ENTER INTO THE QUESTION WHETHER GOD'S APHESIS MAY OR MAY NOT MEAN AS WELL THE SENDING OF HIS SINS OUT OF A MAN AS THE PARDON OF THEM
2589-177234-0012 WHETHER IT MAY NOT SOMETIMES MEAN DISMISSION AND SOMETIMES REMISSION I AM SURE THE ONE DEED CANNOT BE SEPARATED FROM THE OTHER THAT THE PHRASE HERE INTENDS REPENTANCE UNTO THE CEASING FROM SIN
2589-177234-0013 THE GIVING UP OF WHAT IS WRONG I WILL TRY TO SHOW AT LEAST PROBABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE THE USER OF THE PHRASE EITHER DEFINES THE CHANGE OF MIND HE MEANS AS ONE THAT HAS FOR ITS OBJECT THE PARDON OF GOD
2589-177234-0014 OR AS ONE THAT REACHES TO A NEW LIFE THE LATTER SEEMS TO ME THE MORE NATURAL INTERPRETATION BY FAR THE KIND AND SCOPE OF THE REPENTANCE OR CHANGE
2589-177234-0015 AND NOT ANY END TO BE GAINED BY IT APPEARS INTENDED THE CHANGE MUST BE ONE OF WILL AND CONDUCT A RADICAL CHANGE OF LIFE ON THE PART OF THE MAN HE MUST REPENT THAT IS CHANGE HIS MIND
2589-177234-0016 THE MORE DIRECT THE FULLER OF MEANING THE MORE LOGICAL NEXT IN SAINT MATTHEW'S GOSPEL THE BAPTIST'S BUTTRESSING ARGUMENT OR IMMINENT MOTIVE FOR THE CHANGE HE IS PRESSING UPON THE PEOPLE IS
2589-177234-0017 THAT THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND BECAUSE THE KING OF HEAVEN IS COMING YOU MUST GIVE UP YOUR SINNING THE SAME ARGUMENT FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION
2589-177234-0018 MAKE STRAIGHT IN THE DESERT A HIGHWAY FOR OUR GOD THE ONLY TRUE THE ONLY POSSIBLE PREPARATION FOR THE COMING LORD IS TO CEASE FROM DOING EVIL AND BEGIN TO DO WELL TO SEND AWAY SIN
2589-177234-0019 THEY MUST CLEANSE NOT THE STREETS OF THEIR CITIES NOT THEIR HOUSES OR THEIR GARMENTS OR EVEN THEIR PERSONS BUT THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR DOINGS
2589-177234-0020 IT IS TRUE THE BAPTIST DID NOT SEE THAT THE KINGDOM COMING WAS NOT OF THIS WORLD BUT OF THE HIGHER WORLD IN THE HEARTS OF MEN IT IS TRUE THAT HIS FAITH FAILED HIM IN HIS IMPRISONMENT BECAUSE HE HEARD OF NO MARTIAL MOVEMENT ON THE PART OF THE LORD
2589-177234-0021 NO ASSERTION OF HIS SOVEREIGNTY NO CONVINCING SHOW OF HIS POWER BUT HE DID SEE PLAINLY THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS WAS ESSENTIAL TO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN THAT HE DID NOT YET PERCEIVE THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
2589-177234-0022 THAT HE DID NOT SEE THAT THE LORD WAS ALREADY INITIATING HIS KINGDOM BY SENDING AWAY SIN OUT OF THE HEARTS OF HIS PEOPLE IS NOT WONDERFUL THE LORD'S ANSWER TO HIS FORE RUNNER'S MESSAGE OF DOUBT
2589-177234-0023 WAS TO SEND HIS MESSENGER BACK AN EYE WITNESS OF WHAT HE WAS DOING SO TO WAKE OR CLARIFY IN HIM THE PERCEPTION THAT HIS KINGDOM WAS NOT OF THIS WORLD THAT HE DEALT WITH OTHER MEANS
2589-177234-0024 TO ANOTHER END THAN JOHN HAD YET RECOGNIZED AS HIS MISSION OR OBJECT FOR OBEDIENT LOVE IN THE HEART OF THE POOREST HE HEALED OR PERSUADED WAS HIS KINGDOM COME AGAIN OBSERVE THAT
2589-177234-0025 WHEN THE PHARISEES CAME TO JOHN HE SAID TO THEM BRING FORTH THEREFORE FRUITS MEET FOR REPENTANCE IS NOT THIS THE SAME AS REPENT UNTO THE SENDING AWAY OF YOUR SINS NOTE ALSO THAT
2589-177234-0026 WHEN THE MULTITUDES CAME TO THE PROPHET AND ALL WITH THE CLASSES MOST OBNOXIOUS TO THE REST THE PUBLICANS AND THE SOLDIERS ASKED WHAT HE WOULD HAVE THEM DO THUS PLAINLY RECOGNIZING THAT SOMETHING WAS REQUIRED OF THEM
2589-177234-0027 THEY COULD NOT RID THEMSELVES OF THEIR SINS BUT THEY COULD SET ABOUT SENDING THEM AWAY THEY COULD QUARREL WITH THEM AND PROCEED TO TURN THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE
2589-177234-0028 THE LORD WAS ON HIS WAY TO DO HIS PART IN THEIR FINAL BANISHMENT THOSE WHO HAD REPENTED TO THE SENDING AWAY OF THEIR SINS HE WOULD BAPTIZE WITH A HOLY POWER TO SEND THEM AWAY INDEED THE OPERANT WILL TO GET RID OF THEM
2589-177234-0029 WOULD BE BAPTIZED WITH A FIRE THAT SHOULD BURN THEM UP WHEN A MAN BREAKS WITH HIS SINS THEN THE WIND OF THE LORD'S FAN WILL BLOW THEM AWAY THE FIRE OF THE LORD'S HEART WILL CONSUME THEM I THINK THEN
2589-177234-0030 HE HAS NO DESIRE AFTER WHAT IT OFFERS HIM AS REDEMPTION THE GOD IT GIVES HIM NEWS OF IS NOT ONE TO WHOM HE WOULD DRAW NEARER BUT WHEN SUCH A MAN COMES TO SEE THAT THE VERY GOD MUST BE HIS LIFE
2589-177234-0031 THEN HIS WILL IMMEDIATELY SIDES WITH HIS CONSCIENCE HE BEGINS TO TRY TO BE AND FIRST THING TOWARD BEING TO RID HIMSELF OF WHAT IS ANTAGONISTIC TO ALL BEING NAMELY WRONG
2589-177234-0032 BUT FEW AS YET ARE THOSE WHO TAKE UP THEIR PART WHO RESPOND TO THE CALL OF GOD WHO WILL TO BE WHO PUT FORTH A DIVINE EFFORT AFTER REAL EXISTENCE
2589-177234-0033 THAT HIS LIBERTY BE YOUR LIFE AND YOU FREE MEN THAT HE MAY ENTER CLEAR THE HOUSE FOR HIM SEND AWAY THE BAD THINGS OUT OF IT DEPART FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD
2589-177234-0034 DO IT BE IT GREAT OR SMALL FOR INDEED IN THIS REGION THERE IS NO GREAT OR SMALL BE CONTENT WITH YOUR WAGES SAID THE BAPTIST TO THE SOLDIERS TO MANY PEOPLE NOW THE WORD WOULD BE
2589-177234-0035 RULE YOUR TEMPER OR BE COURTEOUS TO ALL OR LET EACH HOLD THE OTHER BETTER THAN HIMSELF OR
2589-177234-0036 ON WHICH WE STAND WE MUST CAST FAR FROM US OUR EVIL THING THAT BLOCKS THE WAY OF HIS CHARIOT WHEELS IF WE DO NOT NEVER WILL THOSE WHEELS ROLL THROUGH OUR STREETS
2589-177234-0037 FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS NEAR SOME OF US I CANNOT SAY ALL FOR I DO NOT KNOW WHO HAVE ALREADY REPENTED WHO HAVE LONG AGO BEGUN TO SEND AWAY OUR SINS NEED FRESH REPENTANCE EVERY DAY
2589-177234-0038 HOW MANY TIMES A DAY GOD ONLY KNOWS WE ARE SO READY TO GET UPON SOME PATH THAT SEEMS TO RUN PARALLEL WITH THE NARROW WAY AND THEN TAKE NO NOTE OF ITS DIVERGENCE
2589-177234-0039 WHAT IS THERE FOR US WHEN WE DISCOVER THAT WE ARE OUT OF THE WAY BUT TO BETHINK OURSELVES AND TURN BY THOSE WHO NEED NO REPENTANCE THE LORD MAY HAVE MEANT SUCH AS HAD REPENTED PERFECTLY
