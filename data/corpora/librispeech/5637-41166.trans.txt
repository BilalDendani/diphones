5637-41166-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SIX IN SEPTEMBER LEVIN MOVED TO MOSCOW FOR KITTY'S CONFINEMENT HE HAD SPENT A WHOLE MONTH IN MOSCOW WITH NOTHING TO DO WHEN SERGEY IVANOVITCH WHO HAD PROPERTY IN THE KASHINSKY PROVINCE
5637-41166-0001 MADE READY TO SET OFF TO THE ELECTIONS HE INVITED HIS BROTHER WHO HAD A VOTE IN THE SELEZNEVSKY DISTRICT TO COME WITH HIM LEVIN HAD MOREOVER TO TRANSACT IN KASHIN SOME EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUSINESS
5637-41166-0002 RELATING TO THE WARDSHIP OF LAND AND TO THE RECEIVING OF CERTAIN REDEMPTION MONEY FOR HIS SISTER WHO WAS ABROAD LEVIN STILL HESITATED BUT KITTY WHO SAW THAT HE WAS BORED IN MOSCOW AND URGED HIM TO GO ON HER OWN AUTHORITY ORDERED HIM THE PROPER NOBLEMAN'S UNIFORM
5637-41166-0003 COSTING SEVEN POUNDS AND THAT SEVEN POUNDS PAID FOR THE UNIFORM WAS THE CHIEF CAUSE THAT FINALLY DECIDED LEVIN TO GO HE WENT TO KASHIN
5637-41166-0004 LEVIN HAD BEEN SIX DAYS IN KASHIN VISITING THE ASSEMBLY EACH DAY AND BUSILY ENGAGED ABOUT HIS SISTER'S BUSINESS WHICH STILL DRAGGED ON THE DISTRICT MARSHALS OF NOBILITY WERE ALL OCCUPIED WITH THE ELECTIONS
5637-41166-0005 AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE SIMPLEST THING DONE THAT DEPENDED UPON THE COURT OF WARDSHIP
5637-41166-0006 AFTER LONG NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE LEGAL DETAILS THE MONEY WAS AT LAST READY TO BE PAID BUT THE NOTARY A MOST OBLIGING PERSON COULD NOT HAND OVER THE ORDER BECAUSE IT MUST HAVE THE SIGNATURE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT
5637-41166-0007 WAS AT THE ELECTIONS ALL THESE WORRYING NEGOTIATIONS THIS ENDLESS GOING FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND TALKING WITH PLEASANT AND EXCELLENT PEOPLE WHO QUITE SAW THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF THE PETITIONER'S POSITION BUT WERE POWERLESS TO ASSIST HIM ALL THESE EFFORTS THAT YIELDED NO RESULT
5637-41166-0008 ONE EXPERIENCES IN DREAMS WHEN ONE TRIES TO USE PHYSICAL FORCE HE FELT THIS FREQUENTLY AS HE TALKED TO HIS MOST GOOD NATURED SOLICITOR THIS SOLICITOR DID IT SEEMED EVERYTHING POSSIBLE AND STRAINED EVERY NERVE TO GET HIM OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES
5637-41166-0009 GO TO SO AND SO AND SO AND SO AND THE SOLICITOR DREW UP A REGULAR PLAN FOR GETTING ROUND THE FATAL POINT THAT HINDERED EVERYTHING BUT HE WOULD ADD IMMEDIATELY IT'LL MEAN SOME DELAY ANYWAY BUT YOU MIGHT TRY IT AND LEVIN DID TRY AND DID GO
5637-41166-0010 EVERYONE WAS KIND AND CIVIL BUT THE POINT EVADED SEEMED TO CROP UP AGAIN IN THE END AND AGAIN TO BAR THE WAY WHAT WAS PARTICULARLY TRYING WAS THAT LEVIN COULD NOT MAKE OUT WITH WHOM HE WAS STRUGGLING TO WHOSE INTEREST IT WAS THAT HIS BUSINESS SHOULD NOT BE DONE
5637-41166-0011 THAT NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW THE SOLICITOR CERTAINLY DID NOT KNOW
5637-41166-0012 BUT WITH THE HINDRANCES THAT CONFRONTED HIM IN HIS BUSINESS NO ONE COULD EXPLAIN WHY THEY EXISTED BUT LEVIN HAD CHANGED A GOOD DEAL SINCE HIS MARRIAGE
5637-41166-0013 AND THAT MOST LIKELY IT MUST BE SO AND HE TRIED NOT TO FRET IN ATTENDING THE ELECTIONS TOO AND TAKING PART IN THEM
5637-41166-0014 NOT TO FALL FOUL OF THEM BUT TO COMPREHEND AS FULLY AS HE COULD THE QUESTION WHICH WAS SO EARNESTLY AND ARDENTLY ABSORBING HONEST
5637-41166-0015 SINCE HIS MARRIAGE THERE HAD BEEN REVEALED TO LEVIN SO MANY NEW AND SERIOUS ASPECTS OF LIFE
5637-41166-0016 SEEMED OF NO IMPORTANCE THAT IN THE QUESTION OF THE ELECTIONS TOO HE ASSUMED AND TRIED TO FIND SOME SERIOUS SIGNIFICANCE SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM THE MEANING AND OBJECT OF THE PROPOSED REVOLUTION AT THE ELECTIONS
5637-41166-0017 THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE IN WHOSE HANDS THE LAW HAD PLACED THE CONTROL OF SO MANY IMPORTANT PUBLIC FUNCTIONS THE GUARDIANSHIP OF WARDS THE VERY DEPARTMENT WHICH WAS GIVING LEVIN SO MUCH TROUBLE JUST NOW
5637-41166-0018 THE DISPOSAL OF LARGE SUMS SUBSCRIBED BY THE NOBILITY OF THE PROVINCE THE HIGH SCHOOLS FEMALE MALE AND MILITARY AND POPULAR INSTRUCTION ON THE NEW MODEL AND FINALLY THE DISTRICT COUNCIL
5637-41166-0019 THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE SNETKOV WAS A NOBLEMAN OF THE OLD SCHOOL DISSIPATING AN IMMENSE FORTUNE A GOOD HEARTED MAN HONEST AFTER HIS OWN FASHION
5637-41166-0020 BUT UTTERLY WITHOUT ANY COMPREHENSION OF THE NEEDS OF MODERN DAYS HE ALWAYS TOOK IN EVERY QUESTION THE SIDE OF THE NOBILITY HE WAS POSITIVELY ANTAGONISTIC TO THE SPREAD OF POPULAR EDUCATION AND HE SUCCEEDED
5637-41166-0021 IN GIVING A PURELY PARTY CHARACTER TO THE DISTRICT COUNCIL WHICH OUGHT BY RIGHTS TO BE OF SUCH AN IMMENSE IMPORTANCE WHAT WAS NEEDED WAS TO PUT IN HIS PLACE A FRESH CAPABLE PERFECTLY MODERN MAN
5637-41166-0022 OF CONTEMPORARY IDEAS AND TO FRAME THEIR POLICY SO AS FROM THE RIGHTS CONFERRED UPON THE NOBLES NOT AS THE NOBILITY BUT AS AN ELEMENT OF THE DISTRICT COUNCIL
5637-41166-0023 THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE DERIVED FROM THEM IN THE WEALTHY KASHINSKY PROVINCE WHICH ALWAYS TOOK THE LEAD OF OTHER PROVINCES IN EVERYTHING THERE WAS NOW SUCH A PREPONDERANCE OF FORCES THAT THIS POLICY ONCE CARRIED THROUGH PROPERLY THERE
5637-41166-0024 MIGHT SERVE AS A MODEL FOR OTHER PROVINCES FOR ALL RUSSIA
5637-41166-0025 OR BETTER STILL NEVYEDOVSKY A FORMER UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR A MAN OF REMARKABLE INTELLIGENCE AND A GREAT FRIEND OF SERGEY IVANOVITCH THE MEETING WAS OPENED BY THE GOVERNOR WHO MADE A SPEECH TO THE NOBLES
5637-41166-0026 URGING THEM TO ELECT THE PUBLIC FUNCTIONARIES NOT FROM REGARD FOR PERSONS BUT FOR THE SERVICE AND WELFARE OF THEIR FATHERLAND AND HOPING THAT THE HONORABLE NOBILITY OF THE KASHINSKY PROVINCE WOULD AS AT ALL FORMER ELECTIONS
5637-41166-0027 HOLD THEIR DUTY AS SACRED AND VINDICATE THE EXALTED CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH WHEN HE HAD FINISHED WITH HIS SPEECH THE GOVERNOR WALKED OUT OF THE HALL AND THE NOBLEMEN NOISILY AND EAGERLY SOME EVEN ENTHUSIASTICALLY
5637-41166-0028 FOLLOWED HIM AND THRONGED ROUND HIM WHILE HE PUT ON HIS FUR COAT
5637-41166-0029 LEVIN ANXIOUS TO SEE INTO EVERYTHING AND NOT TO MISS ANYTHING STOOD THERE TOO IN THE CROWD AND HEARD THE GOVERNOR SAY PLEASE TELL MARYA IVANOVNA MY WIFE IS VERY SORRY SHE COULDN'T COME TO THE HOME
5637-41166-0030 AND THEREUPON THE NOBLES IN HIGH GOOD HUMOR SORTED OUT THEIR FUR COATS AND ALL DROVE OFF TO THE CATHEDRAL IN THE CATHEDRAL LEVIN LIFTING HIS HAND LIKE THE REST AND REPEATING THE WORDS OF THE ARCHDEACON SWORE WITH MOST TERRIBLE OATHS
5637-41166-0031 TO DO ALL THE GOVERNOR HAD HOPED THEY WOULD DO CHURCH SERVICES ALWAYS AFFECTED LEVIN AND AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS I KISS THE CROSS AND GLANCED ROUND AT THE CROWD OF YOUNG AND OLD MEN REPEATING THE SAME HE FELT TOUCHED
5637-41166-0032 AND THE FEMALE HIGH SCHOOL OF NO IMPORTANCE WHATEVER AS SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED AND LEVIN BUSY SEEING AFTER HIS OWN AFFAIRS DID NOT ATTEND THE MEETINGS
5637-41166-0033 ON THE FOURTH DAY THE AUDITING OF THE MARSHAL'S ACCOUNTS TOOK PLACE AT THE HIGH TABLE OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE AND THEN THERE OCCURRED THE FIRST SKIRMISH BETWEEN THE NEW PARTY AND THE OLD
5637-41166-0034 THAT ALL WAS IN ORDER THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE GOT UP THANKED THE NOBILITY FOR THEIR CONFIDENCE AND SHED TEARS THE NOBLES GAVE HIM A LOUD WELCOME AND SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM
5637-41166-0035 THAT THE COMMITTEE HAD NOT VERIFIED THE ACCOUNTS CONSIDERING SUCH A VERIFICATION AN INSULT TO THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE INCAUTIOUSLY ADMITTED THIS THEN A SMALL GENTLEMAN VERY YOUNG LOOKING BUT VERY MALIGNANT
5637-41166-0036 BEGAN TO SAY THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE AGREEABLE TO THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF HIS EXPENDITURES OF THE PUBLIC MONEYS AND THAT THE MISPLACED DELICACY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WAS DEPRIVING HIM OF THIS MORAL SATISFACTION
5637-41166-0037 THEN THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TRIED TO WITHDRAW THEIR ADMISSION AND SERGEY IVANOVITCH BEGAN TO PROVE THAT THEY MUST LOGICALLY ADMIT EITHER
5637-41166-0038 AND HE DEVELOPED THIS DILEMMA IN DETAIL SERGEY IVANOVITCH WAS ANSWERED BY THE SPOKESMAN OF THE OPPOSITE PARTY
5637-41166-0039 THE DISCUSSION LASTED A LONG TIME AND ENDED IN NOTHING LEVIN WAS SURPRISED THAT THEY SHOULD DISPUTE UPON THIS SUBJECT SO LONG ESPECIALLY AS
5637-41166-0040 SERGEY IVANOVITCH ANSWERED OH NO HE'S AN HONEST MAN BUT THOSE OLD FASHIONED METHODS OF PATERNAL FAMILY ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PROVINCIAL AFFAIRS MUST BE BROKEN DOWN
