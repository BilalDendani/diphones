288-130994-0000 OTHER DEFECTS OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY DECEMBER TWELFTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN HAMILTON
288-130994-0001 TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK HAVING IN THE THREE LAST NUMBERS TAKEN A SUMMARY REVIEW OF THE PRINCIPAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND EVENTS WHICH HAVE DEPICTED THE GENIUS AND FATE OF OTHER CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENTS
288-130994-0002 I SHALL NOW PROCEED IN THE ENUMERATION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THOSE DEFECTS WHICH HAVE HITHERTO DISAPPOINTED OUR HOPES FROM THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED AMONG OURSELVES TO FORM A SAFE AND SATISFACTORY JUDGMENT OF THE PROPER REMEDY IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
288-130994-0003 HAVE NO POWERS TO EXACT OBEDIENCE OR PUNISH DISOBEDIENCE TO THEIR RESOLUTIONS EITHER BY PECUNIARY MULCTS
288-130994-0004 OR BY ANY OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL MODE THERE IS NO EXPRESS DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO THEM TO USE FORCE AGAINST DELINQUENT MEMBERS
288-130994-0005 BY WHICH IT IS DECLARED THAT EACH STATE SHALL RETAIN EVERY POWER JURISDICTION AND RIGHT
288-130994-0006 THERE IS DOUBTLESS A STRIKING ABSURDITY IN SUPPOSING THAT A RIGHT OF THIS KIND DOES NOT EXIST
288-130994-0007 OR OF CONTRAVENING OR EXPLAINING AWAY A PROVISION WHICH HAS BEEN OF LATE A REPEATED THEME OF THE EULOGIES OF THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE NEW CONSTITUTION AND THE WANT OF WHICH IN THAT PLAN HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUCH PLAUSIBLE ANIMADVERSION AND SEVERE CRITICISM
288-130994-0008 IF WE ARE UNWILLING TO IMPAIR THE FORCE OF THIS APPLAUDED PROVISION WE SHALL BE OBLIGED TO CONCLUDE THAT THE UNITED STATES AFFORD THE EXTRAORDINARY SPECTACLE OF A GOVERNMENT DESTITUTE EVEN OF THE SHADOW OF CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO ENFORCE THE EXECUTION OF ITS OWN LAWS
288-130994-0009 IT WILL APPEAR FROM THE SPECIMENS WHICH HAVE BEEN CITED THAT THE AMERICAN CONFEDERACY IN THIS PARTICULAR STANDS DISCRIMINATED FROM EVERY OTHER INSTITUTION OF A SIMILAR KIND AND EXHIBITS A NEW AND UNEXAMPLED PHENOMENON IN THE POLITICAL WORLD
288-130994-0010 THE WANT OF A MUTUAL GUARANTY OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS IS ANOTHER CAPITAL IMPERFECTION IN THE FEDERAL PLAN THERE IS NOTHING OF THIS KIND DECLARED IN THE ARTICLES THAT COMPOSE IT
288-130994-0011 MUST BE RENOUNCED USURPATION MAY REAR ITS CREST IN EACH STATE AND TRAMPLE UPON THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE WHILE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT COULD LEGALLY
288-130994-0012 A SUCCESSFUL FACTION MAY ERECT A TYRANNY ON THE RUINS OF ORDER AND LAW WHILE NO SUCCOR COULD CONSTITUTIONALLY BE AFFORDED BY THE UNION TO THE FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS OF THE GOVERNMENT
288-130994-0013 THE INORDINATE PRIDE OF STATE IMPORTANCE HAS SUGGESTED TO SOME MINDS AN OBJECTION TO THE PRINCIPLE OF A GUARANTY IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
288-130994-0014 THIS RIGHT WOULD REMAIN UNDIMINISHED
288-130994-0015 WHERE THE WHOLE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT IS IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE
288-130994-0016 THE NATURAL CURE FOR AN ILL ADMINISTRATION IN A POPULAR OR REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUTION IS A CHANGE OF MEN A GUARANTY BY THE NATIONAL AUTHORITY WOULD BE AS MUCH LEVELLED AGAINST THE USURPATIONS OF RULERS AS AGAINST THE FERMENTS AND OUTRAGES OF FACTION AND SEDITION IN THE COMMUNITY
288-130994-0017 IS ANOTHER FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN THE CONFEDERATION
288-130994-0018 HAS BEEN ALREADY POINTED OUT AND HAS SUFFICIENTLY APPEARED FROM THE TRIAL WHICH HAS BEEN MADE OF IT I SPEAK OF IT NOW SOLELY WITH A VIEW TO EQUALITY AMONG THE STATES
288-130994-0019 WHICH PRODUCE AND CONSTITUTE NATIONAL WEALTH MUST BE SATISFIED THAT THERE IS NO COMMON STANDARD OR BAROMETER BY WHICH THE DEGREES OF IT CAN BE ASCERTAINED
288-130994-0020 THAT THE ACTIVE WEALTH OF KING'S COUNTY BEARS A MUCH GREATER PROPORTION TO THAT OF MONTGOMERY THAN IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE IF WE SHOULD TAKE EITHER THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE LANDS OR THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE AS A CRITERION THE WEALTH OF NATIONS DEPENDS UPON AN INFINITE VARIETY OF CAUSES
288-130994-0021 THE GENIUS OF THE CITIZENS THE DEGREE OF INFORMATION THEY POSSESS THE STATE OF COMMERCE OF ARTS OF INDUSTRY THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND MANY MORE TOO COMPLEX MINUTE OR ADVENTITIOUS TO ADMIT OF A PARTICULAR SPECIFICATION
288-130994-0022 THE CONSEQUENCE CLEARLY IS THAT THERE CAN BE NO COMMON MEASURE OF NATIONAL WEALTH AND OF COURSE NO GENERAL OR STATIONARY RULE BY WHICH THE ABILITY OF A STATE TO PAY TAXES CAN BE DETERMINED
288-130994-0023 THE ATTEMPT THEREFORE TO REGULATE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE MEMBERS OF A CONFEDERACY BY ANY SUCH RULE CANNOT FAIL TO BE PRODUCTIVE OF GLARING INEQUALITY AND EXTREME OPPRESSION THIS INEQUALITY WOULD OF ITSELF
288-130994-0024 UPON A PRINCIPLE WHICH DISTRIBUTES THE PUBLIC BURDENS WITH SO UNEQUAL A HAND AND WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO IMPOVERISH AND OPPRESS THE CITIZENS OF SOME STATES WHILE THOSE OF OTHERS WOULD SCARCELY BE CONSCIOUS OF THE SMALL PROPORTION OF THE WEIGHT THEY WERE REQUIRED TO SUSTAIN
288-130994-0025 WILL IN A DEGREE BE AT HIS OWN OPTION AND CAN BE REGULATED BY AN ATTENTION TO HIS RESOURCES THE RICH MAY BE EXTRAVAGANT THE POOR CAN BE FRUGAL AND PRIVATE OPPRESSION MAY ALWAYS BE AVOIDED BY A JUDICIOUS SELECTION OF OBJECTS
288-130994-0026 PROPER FOR SUCH IMPOSITIONS IF INEQUALITIES SHOULD ARISE IN SOME STATES FROM DUTIES ON PARTICULAR OBJECTS THESE WILL IN ALL PROBABILITY
288-130994-0027 IN THE COURSE OF TIME AND THINGS AN EQUILIBRIUM AS FAR AS IT IS ATTAINABLE IN SO COMPLICATED A SUBJECT WILL BE ESTABLISHED EVERYWHERE
288-130994-0028 THEY WOULD NEITHER BE SO GREAT IN THEIR DEGREE SO UNIFORM IN THEIR OPERATION NOR SO ODIOUS IN THEIR APPEARANCE AS THOSE WHICH WOULD NECESSARILY SPRING FROM QUOTAS UPON ANY SCALE THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE DEVISED
288-130994-0029 THAT THEY CONTAIN IN THEIR OWN NATURE A SECURITY AGAINST EXCESS THEY PRESCRIBE THEIR OWN LIMIT WHICH CANNOT BE EXCEEDED WITHOUT DEFEATING THE END PROPOSED THAT IS AN EXTENSION OF THE REVENUE WHEN APPLIED TO THIS OBJECT
288-130994-0030 THE SAYING IS AS JUST AS IT IS WITTY THAT IN POLITICAL ARITHMETIC TWO AND TWO DO NOT ALWAYS MAKE FOUR IF DUTIES ARE TOO HIGH THEY LESSEN THE CONSUMPTION THE COLLECTION IS ELUDED
288-130994-0031 THIS FORMS A COMPLETE BARRIER AGAINST ANY MATERIAL OPPRESSION OF THE CITIZENS BY TAXES OF THIS CLASS AND IS ITSELF A NATURAL LIMITATION OF THE POWER OF IMPOSING THEM IMPOSITIONS OF THIS KIND USUALLY FALL UNDER THE DENOMINATION OF INDIRECT TAXES
288-130994-0032 AND MUST FOR A LONG TIME CONSTITUTE THE CHIEF PART OF THE REVENUE RAISED IN THIS COUNTRY THOSE OF THE DIRECT KIND WHICH PRINCIPALLY RELATE TO LAND AND BUILDINGS MAY ADMIT OF A RULE OF APPORTIONMENT EITHER THE VALUE OF LAND
288-130994-0033 MAY SERVE AS A STANDARD THE STATE OF AGRICULTURE AND THE POPULOUSNESS OF A COUNTRY HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS NEARLY CONNECTED WITH EACH OTHER AND AS A RULE FOR THE PURPOSE INTENDED NUMBERS IN THE VIEW OF SIMPLICITY AND CERTAINTY ARE ENTITLED TO A PREFERENCE
288-130994-0034 IN EVERY COUNTRY IT IS A HERCULEAN TASK
288-130994-0035 IN A COUNTRY IMPERFECTLY SETTLED AND PROGRESSIVE IN IMPROVEMENT
288-130994-0036 IN ALL SITUATIONS A FORMIDABLE OBJECTION IN A BRANCH OF TAXATION WHERE NO LIMITS TO THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE NATURE OF THINGS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FIXED RULE NOT INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE END
288-130994-0037 MAY BE ATTENDED WITH FEWER INCONVENIENCES THAN TO LEAVE THAT DISCRETION ALTOGETHER AT LARGE
