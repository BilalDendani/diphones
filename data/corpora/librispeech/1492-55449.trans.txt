1492-55449-0000 THE LAST REFINEMENT AND LUXURY OF UNAFFECTED GOOD FEELING A KIND OF SOCIAL SUPERSTITION TO SUPPOSE THAT TO BE TRULY FRIENDLY ONE MUST BE SAYING FRIENDLY WORDS ALL THE TIME ANY MORE THAN BE DOING FRIENDLY DEEDS CONTINUALLY
1492-55449-0001 TRUE FRIENDLINESS LIKE TRUE RELIGION BEING IN A SORT INDEPENDENT OF WORKS AT LENGTH THE GOOD MERCHANT WHOSE EYES WERE PENSIVELY RESTING UPON THE GAY TABLES IN THE DISTANCE
1492-55449-0002 BROKE THE SPELL BY SAYING THAT FROM THE SPECTACLE BEFORE THEM ONE WOULD LITTLE DIVINE WHAT OTHER QUARTERS OF THE BOAT MIGHT REVEAL HE CITED THE CASE ACCIDENTALLY ENCOUNTERED BUT AN HOUR OR TWO PREVIOUS OF A SHRUNKEN OLD MISER CLAD IN
1492-55449-0003 SHRUNKEN OLD MOLESKIN STRETCHED OUT AN INVALID ON A BARE PLANK IN THE EMIGRANTS QUARTERS EAGERLY CLINGING TO LIFE AND LUCRE THOUGH THE ONE WAS GASPING FOR OUTLET AND ABOUT THE OTHER HE WAS IN TORMENT LEST DEATH OR
1492-55449-0004 SOME OTHER UNPRINCIPLED CUT PURSE SHOULD BE THE MEANS OF HIS LOSING IT BY LIKE FEEBLE TENURE HOLDING LUNGS AND POUCH AND YET KNOWING AND DESIRING NOTHING BEYOND THEM FOR HIS MIND NEVER RAISED ABOVE MOULD WAS NOW
1492-55449-0005 ALL BUT MOULDERED AWAY TO SUCH A DEGREE INDEED THAT HE HAD NO TRUST IN ANYTHING NOT EVEN IN HIS PARCHMENT BONDS WHICH THE BETTER TO PRESERVE FROM THE TOOTH OF TIME HE HAD PACKED DOWN AND SEALED UP LIKE BRANDY PEACHES IN A TIN CASE OF SPIRITS
1492-55449-0006 HE HINTED TO BE A SOMEWHAT JAUNDICED SENTIMENTALITY NATURE HE ADDED IN SHAKESPEARE'S WORDS HAD MEAL AND BRAN AND RIGHTLY REGARDED THE BRAN IN ITS WAY WAS NOT TO BE CONDEMNED
1492-55449-0007 THE OTHER WAS NOT DISPOSED TO QUESTION THE JUSTICE OF SHAKESPEARE'S THOUGHT BUT WOULD HARDLY ADMIT THE PROPRIETY OF THE APPLICATION IN THIS INSTANCE MUCH LESS OF THE COMMENT SO AFTER SOME FURTHER TEMPERATE DISCUSSION OF THE PITIABLE MISER
1492-55449-0008 FINDING THAT THEY COULD NOT ENTIRELY HARMONIZE THE MERCHANT CITED ANOTHER CASE THAT OF THE NEGRO CRIPPLE BUT HIS COMPANION SUGGESTED WHETHER THE ALLEGED HARDSHIPS OF THAT ALLEGED UNFORTUNATE MIGHT NOT EXIST MORE IN THE PITY OF THE OBSERVER
1492-55449-0009 THAN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE OBSERVED HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE CRIPPLE NOR HAD SEEN HIM BUT VENTURED TO SURMISE THAT COULD ONE BUT GET AT THE REAL STATE OF HIS HEART HE WOULD BE FOUND ABOUT AS HAPPY AS MOST MEN IF NOT
1492-55449-0010 IN FACT FULL AS HAPPY AS THE SPEAKER HIMSELF HE ADDED THAT NEGROES WERE BY NATURE A SINGULARLY CHEERFUL RACE NO ONE EVER HEARD OF A NATIVE BORN AFRICAN ZIMMERMANN OR TORQUEMADA THAT EVEN FROM RELIGION THEY DISMISSED ALL GLOOM
1492-55449-0011 IN THEIR HILARIOUS RITUALS THEY DANCED SO TO SPEAK AND AS IT WERE CUT PIGEON WINGS IT WAS IMPROBABLE THEREFORE THAT A NEGRO HOWEVER REDUCED TO HIS STUMPS BY FORTUNE COULD BE EVER THROWN OFF THE LEGS OF A LAUGHING PHILOSOPHY
1492-55449-0012 FOILED AGAIN THE GOOD MERCHANT WOULD NOT DESIST BUT VENTURED STILL A THIRD CASE THAT OF THE MAN WITH THE WEED WHOSE STORY AS NARRATED BY HIMSELF AND CONFIRMED AND FILLED OUT BY THE TESTIMONY OF A CERTAIN MAN IN A GRAY COAT
1492-55449-0013 WHOM THE MERCHANT HAD AFTERWARDS MET HE NOW PROCEEDED TO GIVE AND THAT WITHOUT HOLDING BACK THOSE PARTICULARS DISCLOSED BY THE SECOND INFORMANT BUT WHICH DELICACY HAD PREVENTED THE UNFORTUNATE MAN HIMSELF FROM TOUCHING UPON
1492-55449-0014 BUT AS THE GOOD MERCHANT COULD PERHAPS DO BETTER JUSTICE TO THE MAN THAN THE STORY WE SHALL VENTURE TO TELL IT IN OTHER WORDS THAN HIS THOUGH NOT TO ANY OTHER EFFECT CHAPTER TWELVE STORY OF THE UNFORTUNATE MAN
1492-55449-0015 FROM WHICH MAY BE GATHERED WHETHER OR NO HE HAS BEEN JUSTLY SO ENTITLED IT APPEARED THAT THE UNFORTUNATE MAN HAD HAD FOR A WIFE ONE OF THOSE NATURES ANOMALOUSLY VICIOUS
1492-55449-0016 WHICH WOULD ALMOST TEMPT A METAPHYSICAL LOVER OF OUR SPECIES TO DOUBT WHETHER THE HUMAN FORM BE IN ALL CASES CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF HUMANITY WHETHER SOMETIMES IT MAY NOT BE A KIND OF UNPLEDGED AND INDIFFERENT TABERNACLE AND WHETHER
1492-55449-0017 AN UNACCOUNTABLE ONE CONSIDERING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SO GOOD A MAN THAT HE WHO HATES VICE HATES HUMANITY IT SHOULD NOT IN SELF DEFENSE BE HELD FOR A REASONABLE MAXIM THAT NONE BUT THE GOOD ARE HUMAN
1492-55449-0018 GONERIL WAS YOUNG IN PERSON LITHE AND STRAIGHT TOO STRAIGHT INDEED FOR A WOMAN A COMPLEXION NATURALLY ROSY AND WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN CHARMINGLY SO BUT FOR A CERTAIN HARDNESS AND BAKEDNESS
1492-55449-0019 LIKE THAT OF THE GLAZED COLORS ON STONE WARE HER HAIR WAS OF A DEEP RICH CHESTNUT BUT WORN IN CLOSE SHORT CURLS ALL ROUND HER HEAD HER INDIAN FIGURE WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS IMPAIRING EFFECT ON HER BUST
1492-55449-0020 UPON THE WHOLE AIDED BY THE RESOURCES OF THE TOILET HER APPEARANCE AT DISTANCE WAS SUCH THAT SOME MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT HER IF ANYTHING RATHER BEAUTIFUL THOUGH OF A STYLE OF BEAUTY RATHER PECULIAR AND CACTUS LIKE
1492-55449-0021 WHILE HAVING A NATURAL ANTIPATHY TO SUCH THINGS AS THE BREAST OF CHICKEN OR CUSTARD OR PEACH OR GRAPE GONERIL COULD YET IN PRIVATE MAKE A SATISFACTORY LUNCH ON HARD CRACKERS AND BRAWN OF HAM SHE LIKED LEMONS
1492-55449-0022 AND THE ONLY KIND OF CANDY SHE LOVED WERE LITTLE DRIED STICKS OF BLUE CLAY SECRETLY CARRIED IN HER POCKET WITHAL SHE HAD HARD STEADY HEALTH LIKE A SQUAW'S WITH AS FIRM A SPIRIT AND RESOLUTION
1492-55449-0023 SOME OTHER POINTS ABOUT HER WERE LIKEWISE SUCH AS PERTAIN TO THE WOMEN OF SAVAGE LIFE LITHE THOUGH SHE WAS SHE LOVED SUPINENESS BUT UPON OCCASION COULD ENDURE LIKE A STOIC SHE WAS TACITURN TOO
1492-55449-0024 FROM EARLY MORNING TILL ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON SHE WOULD SELDOM SPEAK IT TAKING THAT TIME TO THAW HER BY ALL ACCOUNTS INTO BUT TALKING TERMS WITH HUMANITY DURING THE INTERVAL SHE DID LITTLE BUT LOOK
1492-55449-0025 AND KEEP LOOKING OUT OF HER LARGE METALLIC EYES WHICH HER ENEMIES CALLED COLD AS A CUTTLE FISH'S BUT WHICH BY HER WERE ESTEEMED GAZELLE LIKE FOR GONERIL WAS NOT WITHOUT VANITY
1492-55449-0026 THOSE WHO THOUGHT THEY BEST KNEW HER OFTEN WONDERED WHAT HAPPINESS SUCH A BEING COULD TAKE IN LIFE NOT CONSIDERING THE HAPPINESS WHICH IS TO BE HAD BY SOME NATURES IN THE VERY EASY WAY OF SIMPLY CAUSING PAIN TO THOSE AROUND THEM
1492-55449-0027 THOSE WHO SUFFERED FROM GONERIL'S STRANGE NATURE MIGHT WITH ONE OF THOSE HYBERBOLES TO WHICH THE RESENTFUL INCLINE HAVE PRONOUNCED HER SOME KIND OF TOAD BUT HER WORST SLANDERERS COULD NEVER WITH ANY SHOW OF JUSTICE
1492-55449-0028 HAVE ACCUSED HER OF BEING A TOADY IN A LARGE SENSE SHE POSSESSED THE VIRTUE OF INDEPENDENCE OF MIND GONERIL HELD IT FLATTERY TO HINT PRAISE EVEN OF THE ABSENT AND EVEN IF MERITED
1492-55449-0029 PASSION IS HUMAN LIKE AN ICICLE DAGGER GONERIL AT ONCE STABBED AND FROZE SO AT LEAST THEY SAID AND WHEN SHE SAW FRANKNESS AND INNOCENCE TYRANNIZED INTO SAD NERVOUSNESS UNDER HER SPELL
1492-55449-0030 ACCORDING TO THE SAME AUTHORITY INLY SHE CHEWED HER BLUE CLAY AND YOU COULD MARK THAT SHE CHUCKLED
1492-55449-0031 BUT ANOTHER WAS ALLEGED ONE REALLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE IN COMPANY SHE HAD A STRANGE WAY OF TOUCHING AS BY ACCIDENT THE ARM OR HAND OF COMELY YOUNG MEN AND SEEMED TO REAP A SECRET DELIGHT FROM IT
1492-55449-0032 BUT WHETHER FROM THE HUMANE SATISFACTION OF HAVING GIVEN THE EVIL TOUCH AS IT IS CALLED OR WHETHER IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE IN HER NOT EQUALLY WONDERFUL BUT QUITE AS DEPLORABLE REMAINED AN ENIGMA
1492-55449-0033 NEEDLESS TO SAY WHAT DISTRESS WAS THE UNFORTUNATE MAN'S WHEN ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH COMPANY HE WOULD SUDDENLY PERCEIVE HIS GONERIL BESTOWING HER MYSTERIOUS TOUCHES
1492-55449-0034 ESPECIALLY IN SUCH CASES WHERE THE STRANGENESS OF THE THING SEEMED TO STRIKE UPON THE TOUCHED PERSON NOTWITHSTANDING GOOD BREEDING FORBADE HIS PROPOSING THE MYSTERY ON THE SPOT AS A SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION FOR THE COMPANY
1492-55449-0035 IN THESE CASES TOO THE UNFORTUNATE MAN COULD NEVER ENDURE SO MUCH AS TO LOOK UPON THE TOUCHED YOUNG GENTLEMAN AFTERWARDS FEARFUL OF THE MORTIFICATION OF MEETING IN HIS COUNTENANCE SOME KIND OF MORE OR LESS QUIZZINGLY KNOWING EXPRESSION
1492-55449-0036 HE WOULD SHUDDERINGLY SHUN THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN SO THAT HERE TO THE HUSBAND GONERIL'S TOUCH HAD THE DREAD OPERATION OF THE HEATHEN TABOO NOW GONERIL BROOKED NO CHIDING
1492-55449-0037 SO AT FAVORABLE TIMES HE IN A WARY MANNER AND NOT INDELICATELY WOULD VENTURE IN PRIVATE INTERVIEWS GENTLY TO MAKE DISTANT ALLUSIONS TO THIS QUESTIONABLE PROPENSITY SHE DIVINED HIM
1492-55449-0038 BUT IN HER COLD LOVELESS WAY SAID IT WAS WITLESS TO BE TELLING ONE'S DREAMS ESPECIALLY FOOLISH ONES BUT IF THE UNFORTUNATE MAN LIKED CONNUBIALLY TO REJOICE HIS SOUL WITH SUCH CHIMERAS MUCH CONNUBIAL JOY MIGHT THEY GIVE HIM
1492-55449-0039 A TOUCHING CASE BUT ALL MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN BORNE BY THE UNFORTUNATE MAN CONSCIENTIOUSLY MINDFUL OF HIS VOW FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE TO LOVE AND CHERISH HIS DEAR GONERIL SO LONG AS KIND HEAVEN MIGHT SPARE HER TO HIM
1492-55449-0040 BUT WHEN AFTER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED THE DEVIL OF JEALOUSY ENTERED HER A CALM CLAYEY CAKEY DEVIL FOR NONE OTHER COULD POSSESS HER AND THE OBJECT OF THAT DERANGED JEALOUSY HER OWN CHILD
1492-55449-0041 A LITTLE GIRL OF SEVEN HER FATHER'S CONSOLATION AND PET WHEN HE SAW GONERIL ARTFULLY TORMENT THE LITTLE INNOCENT AND THEN PLAY THE MATERNAL HYPOCRITE WITH IT THE UNFORTUNATE MAN'S PATIENT LONG SUFFERING GAVE WAY
1492-55449-0042 KNOWING THAT SHE WOULD NEITHER CONFESS NOR AMEND AND MIGHT POSSIBLY BECOME EVEN WORSE THAN SHE WAS HE THOUGHT IT BUT DUTY AS A FATHER TO WITHDRAW THE CHILD FROM HER BUT
1492-55449-0043 LOVING IT AS HE DID HE COULD NOT DO SO WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING IT INTO DOMESTIC EXILE HIMSELF WHICH HARD THOUGH IT WAS HE DID WHEREUPON THE WHOLE FEMALE NEIGHBORHOOD WHO TILL NOW HAD
1492-55449-0044 BROKE OUT IN INDIGNATION AGAINST A HUSBAND WHO WITHOUT ASSIGNING A CAUSE COULD DELIBERATELY ABANDON THE WIFE OF HIS BOSOM AND SHARPEN THE STING TO HER TOO BY DEPRIVING HER OF THE SOLACE OF RETAINING HER OFFSPRING
1492-55449-0045 TO ALL THIS SELF RESPECT WITH CHRISTIAN CHARITY TOWARDS GONERIL LONG KEPT THE UNFORTUNATE MAN DUMB AND WELL HAD IT BEEN HAD HE CONTINUED SO FOR WHEN DRIVEN TO DESPERATION HE HINTED SOMETHING OF THE TRUTH OF THE CASE
1492-55449-0046 NOT A SOUL WOULD CREDIT IT WHILE FOR GONERIL SHE PRONOUNCED ALL HE SAID TO BE A MALICIOUS INVENTION ERE LONG AT THE SUGGESTION OF SOME WOMAN'S RIGHTS WOMEN THE INJURED WIFE BEGAN A SUIT
1492-55449-0047 AND THANKS TO ABLE COUNSEL AND ACCOMMODATING TESTIMONY SUCCEEDED IN SUCH A WAY AS NOT ONLY TO RECOVER CUSTODY OF THE CHILD BUT TO GET SUCH A SETTLEMENT AWARDED UPON A SEPARATION AS TO MAKE PENNILESS THE UNFORTUNATE MAN SO HE AVERRED
1492-55449-0048 BESIDES THROUGH THE LEGAL SYMPATHY SHE ENLISTED EFFECTING A JUDICIAL BLASTING OF HIS PRIVATE REPUTATION WHAT MADE IT YET MORE LAMENTABLE WAS THAT THE UNFORTUNATE MAN THINKING THAT BEFORE THE COURT HIS WISEST PLAN AS WELL AS THE MOST
1492-55449-0049 CHRISTIAN BESIDES BEING AS HE DEEMED NOT AT VARIANCE WITH THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER WOULD BE TO PUT FORTH THE PLEA OF THE MENTAL DERANGEMENT OF GONERIL WHICH DONE HE COULD WITH LESS OF MORTIFICATION TO HIMSELF AND ODIUM TO HER
1492-55449-0050 REVEAL IN SELF DEFENSE THOSE ECCENTRICITIES WHICH HAD LED TO HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE JOYS OF WEDLOCK HAD MUCH ADO IN THE END TO PREVENT THIS CHARGE OF DERANGEMENT FROM FATALLY RECOILING UPON HIMSELF ESPECIALLY WHEN
1492-55449-0051 AMONG OTHER THINGS HE ALLEGED HER MYSTERIOUS TEACHINGS IN VAIN DID HIS COUNSEL STRIVING TO MAKE OUT THE DERANGEMENT TO BE WHERE IN FACT IF ANYWHERE IT WAS URGE THAT TO HOLD OTHERWISE TO HOLD THAT SUCH A BEING AS GONERIL WAS SANE
1492-55449-0052 THIS WAS CONSTRUCTIVELY A LIBEL UPON WOMANKIND LIBEL BE IT AND ALL ENDED BY THE UNFORTUNATE MAN'S SUBSEQUENTLY GETTING WIND OF GONERIL'S INTENTION TO PROCURE HIM TO BE PERMANENTLY COMMITTED FOR A LUNATIC
1492-55449-0053 UPON WHICH HE FLED AND WAS NOW AN INNOCENT OUTCAST WANDERING FORLORN IN THE GREAT VALLEY OF THE MISSISSIPPI WITH A WEED ON HIS HAT FOR THE LOSS OF HIS GONERIL FOR HE HAD LATELY SEEN BY THE PAPERS THAT SHE WAS DEAD
1492-55449-0054 AND THOUGHT IT BUT PROPER TO COMPLY WITH THE PRESCRIBED FORM OF MOURNING IN SUCH CASES FOR SOME DAYS PAST HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO GET MONEY ENOUGH TO RETURN TO HIS CHILD AND WAS BUT NOW STARTED WITH INADEQUATE FUNDS
