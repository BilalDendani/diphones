1025-75365-0000 AT THE BIRTH OF SOCIETY INSTINCTS EXISTED NEEDFUL TO THE ANIMAL AND HAVING A CERTAIN GLORIOUS IMPETUOSITY ABOUT THEM WHICH PROMPTED COMMON ACTION AND SPEECH AND A PUBLIC MORALITY AND MEN WERE LED TO CONSTRUCT MYTHS THAT MIGHT SEEM TO JUSTIFY THIS CO OPERATION
1025-75365-0001 PATERNAL AUTHORITY COULD EASILY SUGGEST ONE SYMBOL FOR SOCIAL LOYALTY THE CHIEF PROBABLY A VENERABLE AND IMPERIOUS PERSONAGE COULD BE CALLED A FATHER AND OBEYED AS A NATURAL MASTER
1025-75365-0002 HIS COMMAND MIGHT BY CONVENTION BE REGARDED AS AN EXPRESSION OF THE COMMON VOICE JUST AS THE FATHER'S WILL IS BY NATURE THE REPRESENTATIVE OF HIS CHILDREN'S INTERESTS
1025-75365-0003 AGAIN THE MEMBERS OF EACH COMMUNITY WERE DISTINGUISHED FROM THEIR ENEMIES BY MANY A SIGN AND CUSTOM THESE SIGNS AND CUSTOMS MIGHT ALSO BECOME A GRAPHIC SYMBOL FOR THE COMMON LIFE BOTH THESE CASES SUGGEST HOW EASILY A SYMBOL TAKES THE PLACE OF ITS OBJECT AND BECOMES AN IDOL
1025-75365-0004 IF THE SYMBOL HAPPENS TO BE A MAN THERE ARE NATURAL HUMAN SENTIMENTS AWAKENED BY HIM AND WHATEVER RESPECT HIS CHARACTER OR GIFTS MAY INSPIRE WHATEVER CHARM THERE MAY BE IN HIS PERSON WHATEVER GRACIOUSNESS HE MAY ADD TO HIS OFFICIAL FAVOURS OR COMMANDS INCREASE IMMENSELY HIS PERSONAL ASCENDENCY
1025-75365-0005 A KING HAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE HIMSELF LOVED THIS SCOPE GIVEN TO PRIVATE INCLINATION IS WHAT TO ORDINARY FANCY MAKES ROYALTY ENVIABLE FEW ENVY ITS IMPERSONAL POWER AND HISTORIC WEIGHT
1025-75365-0006 YET IF A KING WERE NOTHING BUT A MAN SURROUNDED BY FLATTERERS WHO WAS CHEERED WHEN HE DROVE ABROAD THERE WOULD BE LITTLE STABILITY IN MONARCHY A KING IS REALLY THE STATE'S HINGE AND CENTRE OF GRAVITY THE POINT WHERE ALL PRIVATE AND PARTY AMBITIONS MEET AND IN A SENSE ARE NEUTRALISED
1025-75365-0007 IT IS NOT EASY FOR FACTIONS TO OVERTURN HIM FOR EVERY OTHER FORCE IN THE STATE WILL INSTINCTIVELY SUPPORT HIM AGAINST FACTION
1025-75365-0008 HIS ELEVATION ABOVE EVERYONE THE IDENTITY OF HIS SOBER INTERESTS WITH THOSE OF THE STATE AT LARGE IS CALCULATED TO MAKE HIM THE PEOPLE'S NATURAL REPRESENTATIVE HIS WORD HAS THEREFORE A GENUINE AUTHORITY AND HIS ASCENDENCY NOT BEING INVIDIOUS IS ABLE TO SECURE INTERNAL PEACE EVEN WHEN NOT ENLIGHTENED ENOUGH TO INSURE PROSPERITY OR TO AVOID FOREIGN WARS
1025-75365-0009 ACCORDINGLY WHENEVER A MONARCHY IS AT ALL REPRESENTATIVE TIME HAS AN IRRESISTIBLE TENDENCY TO INCREASE ITS PRESTIGE THE KING IS FELT TO BE THE GUARDIAN AS WELL AS THE SYMBOL OF ALL PUBLIC GREATNESS MEANTIME A DOUBLE DISLOCATION IS POSSIBLE HERE PATRIOTISM MAY BE WHOLLY IDENTIFIED WITH PERSONAL LOYALTY TO THE SOVEREIGN
1025-75365-0010 WHILE THE SOVEREIGN HIMSELF INSTEAD OF MAKING PUBLIC INTERESTS HIS OWN MAY DIRECT HIS POLICY SO AS TO SATISFY HIS PRIVATE PASSIONS THE FIRST CONFUSION LEADS TO A CONFLICT BETWEEN TRADITION AND REASON THE SECOND TO THE RUIN OF EITHER THE STATE OR THE MONARCHY IN A WORD
1025-75365-0011 THE FEUDAL SYSTEM OFFERS PERHAPS THE BEST ILLUSTRATION OF A PATRIOTISM WHOLLY SUBMERGED IN LOYALTY THE SENSE OF MUTUAL OBLIGATION AND SERVICE WAS VERY CLEAR IN THIS CASE THE VASSAL IN SWEARING FEALTY KNEW PERFECTLY WELL WHAT SORT OF A BARGAIN HE WAS STRIKING
1025-75365-0012 A FEUDAL GOVERNMENT WHILE IT LASTED WAS ACCORDINGLY HIGHLY RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE IF FALSE TO ITS CALLING IT COULD BE READILY DISOWNED FOR IT IS EASY TO BREAK AN OATH AND TO MAKE NEW MILITARY ASSOCIATIONS ESPECIALLY WHERE TERRITORIAL UNITS ARE SMALL AND THEIR LINKS ACCIDENTAL
1025-75365-0013 BUT THIS PERSONAL CONSCIOUS AND JEALOUS SUBORDINATION OF MAN TO MAN CONSTITUTED A GOVERNMENT OF INSIGNIFICANT SCOPE
1025-75365-0014 MILITARY FUNCTIONS WERE ALONE CONSIDERED AND THE REST WAS ALLOWED TO SHIFT FOR ITSELF FEUDALISM COULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE ONLY IN A BARBAROUS AGE WHEN THE ARTS EXISTED ON SUFFERANCE AND LIVED ON BY LITTLE TENTATIVE RESURRECTIONS
1025-75365-0015 THE FEUDAL LORD WAS A GENUINE REPRESENTATIVE OF A VERY SMALL PART OF HIS VASSAL'S INTERESTS
1025-75365-0016 THIS SLIGHT BOND SUFFICED HOWEVER TO GIVE HIM A GREAT PRESTIGE AND TO STIMULATE IN HIM ALL THE HABITS AND VIRTUES OF A RESPONSIBLE MASTER SO THAT IN ENGLAND WHERE VESTIGES OF FEUDALISM ABOUND TO THIS DAY
1025-75365-0017 A HIGHLY CONCENTRATED MONARCHY PRESENTS THE EXACTLY OPPOSITE PHENOMENON HERE SUBORDINATION IS INVOLUNTARY AND MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY LARGELY UNCONSCIOUS ON THE OTHER HAND THE SCOPE OF REPRESENTATION IS VERY WIDE AND THE MONARCH MAY WELL EMBODY THE WHOLE LIFE OF THE NATION
1025-75365-0018 A GREAT COURT WITH OFFICERS OF STATE AND A STANDING ARMY IS SENSITIVE TO NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO GENERAL APPEARANCES AND GENERAL RESULTS THE INVISIBLE FORCES OF INDUSTRY MORALITY AND PERSONAL AMBITION THAT REALLY SUSTAIN THE STATE ARE NOT STUDIED OR FOMENTED BY SUCH A GOVERNMENT
1025-75365-0019 SO THAT WHEN THESE RESOURCES BEGIN TO FAIL THE ENSUING CATASTROPHES ARE A MYSTERY TO EVERYBODY THE KING AND HIS MINISTERS NEVER CEASE WONDERING HOW THEY CAN BE SO CONSTANTLY UNFORTUNATE
1025-75365-0020 SO LONG HOWEVER AS THE NATION'S VITAL FORCE IS UNSPENT AND TAXES AND SOLDIERS ARE AVAILABLE IN PLENTY A GREAT MONARCHY TENDS TO TURN THOSE RESOURCES TO NOTABLE RESULTS THE ARTS AND SCIENCES ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE PATRONAGE OF MEN OF BREEDING AND AFFAIRS
1025-75365-0021 THEY ARE DISCIPLINED INTO A CERTAIN FIRMNESS AND AMPLITUDE WHICH ARTISTS AND SCHOLARS IF LEFT TO THEMSELVES ARE COMMONLY INCAPABLE OF LIFE IS REFINED RELIGION ITSELF UNLESS FANATICISM BE TOO HOPELESSLY IN THE ASCENDANT IS CO ORDINATED WITH OTHER PUBLIC INTERESTS AND COMPELLED TO SERVE MANKIND
1025-75365-0022 A LIBERAL LIFE IS MADE POSSIBLE THE IMAGINATION IS STIMULATED AND SET FREE BY THAT SAME BRILLIANT CONCENTRATION OF ALL HUMAN ENERGIES WHICH DEFEATS PRACTICAL LIBERTY AT THE SAME TIME LUXURY AND ALL MANNER OF CONCEITS ARE PART AND PARCEL OF SUCH A COURTLY CIVILISATION
1025-75365-0023 AND ITS BEST PRODUCTS ARE THE FIRST TO BE LOST SO THAT VERY LIKELY THE DUMB FORCES OF SOCIETY HUNGER CONSCIENCE AND MALICE WILL NOT DO ANY GREAT HARM WHEN THEY DESTROY THOSE TREACHEROUS INSTITUTIONS WHICH AFTER GIVING THE SPIRIT A MOMENTARY EXPRESSION HAD BECOME AN OFFENCE TO BOTH SPIRIT AND FLESH
1025-75365-0024 WHERE NO SUITABLE PERSONS ARE FOUND TO EMBODY THE STATE'S UNITY OTHER SYMBOLS HAVE TO BE CHOSEN
1025-75365-0025 MAY SERVE THIS SYMBOLIC PURPOSE A TRIVIAL EMBLEM WHICH NO THINKING MAN CAN SUBSTITUTE FOR THE THING SIGNIFIED IS NOT SO GREAT AN ADVANTAGE AS AT FIRST SIGHT IT MIGHT SEEM FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE MEN ARE OFTEN THOUGHTLESS AND ADORE WORDS AND SYMBOLS WITH A TERRIBLE EARNESTNESS
1025-75365-0026 WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND AN ABSTRACT TOKEN BECAUSE OF ITS NATURAL INSIPIDITY
