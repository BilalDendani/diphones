1353-122456-0000 D'ARTAGNAN LEFT THE HOTEL INSTEAD OF GOING UP AT ONCE TO KITTY'S CHAMBER AS SHE ENDEAVORED TO PERSUADE HIM TO DO AND THAT FOR TWO REASONS
1353-122456-0001 THE FIRST BECAUSE BY THIS MEANS HE SHOULD ESCAPE REPROACHES RECRIMINATIONS AND PRAYERS THE SECOND BECAUSE HE WAS NOT SORRY TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF READING HIS OWN THOUGHTS AND ENDEAVORING IF POSSIBLE TO FATHOM THOSE OF THIS WOMAN
1353-122456-0002 AND THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM AT ALL IN AN INSTANT D'ARTAGNAN PERCEIVED THAT THE BEST WAY IN WHICH HE COULD ACT
1353-122456-0003 IN WHICH HE WOULD CONFESS TO HER THAT HE AND DE WARDES WERE UP TO THE PRESENT MOMENT ABSOLUTELY THE SAME AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY HE COULD NOT UNDERTAKE WITHOUT COMMITTING SUICIDE TO KILL THE COMTE DE WARDES
1353-122456-0004 BUT HE ALSO WAS SPURRED ON BY A FEROCIOUS DESIRE OF VENGEANCE HE WISHED TO SUBDUE THIS WOMAN IN HIS OWN NAME AND AS THIS VENGEANCE APPEARED TO HIM TO HAVE A CERTAIN SWEETNESS IN IT HE COULD NOT MAKE UP HIS MIND TO RENOUNCE IT
1353-122456-0005 HE WALKED SIX OR SEVEN TIMES ROUND THE PLACE ROYALE TURNING AT EVERY TEN STEPS TO LOOK AT THE LIGHT IN MILADY'S APARTMENT WHICH WAS TO BE SEEN THROUGH THE BLINDS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THIS TIME THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS NOT IN SUCH HASTE TO RETIRE TO HER APARTMENT
1353-122456-0006 AS SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST AT LENGTH THE LIGHT DISAPPEARED WITH THIS LIGHT WAS EXTINGUISHED THE LAST IRRESOLUTION IN THE HEART OF D'ARTAGNAN HE RECALLED TO HIS MIND THE DETAILS OF THE FIRST NIGHT AND WITH A BEATING HEART
1353-122456-0007 AND A BRAIN ON FIRE HE RE ENTERED THE HOTEL AND FLEW TOWARD KITTY'S CHAMBER THE POOR GIRL PALE AS DEATH AND TREMBLING IN ALL HER LIMBS WISHED TO DELAY HER LOVER
1353-122456-0008 HAD HEARD THE NOISE D'ARTAGNAN HAD MADE AND OPENING THE DOOR SAID COME IN ALL THIS WAS OF SUCH INCREDIBLE IMMODESTY OF SUCH MONSTROUS EFFRONTERY
1353-122456-0009 THAT D'ARTAGNAN COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE WHAT HE SAW OR WHAT HE HEARD HE IMAGINED HIMSELF TO BE DRAWN INTO ONE OF THOSE FANTASTIC INTRIGUES ONE MEETS IN DREAMS
1353-122456-0010 YIELDING TO THAT MAGNETIC ATTRACTION WHICH THE LOADSTONE EXERCISES OVER IRON AS THE DOOR CLOSED AFTER THEM KITTY RUSHED TOWARD IT JEALOUSY FURY OFFENDED PRIDE ALL THE PASSIONS IN SHORT
1353-122456-0011 URGED HER TO MAKE A REVELATION BUT SHE REFLECTED THAT SHE WOULD BE TOTALLY LOST IF SHE CONFESSED HAVING ASSISTED
1353-122456-0012 IT WAS NO LONGER A RIVAL WHO WAS BELOVED IT WAS HIMSELF WHO WAS APPARENTLY BELOVED A SECRET VOICE WHISPERED TO HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART THAT HE WAS BUT AN INSTRUMENT OF VENGEANCE THAT HE WAS ONLY CARESSED TILL HE HAD GIVEN DEATH
1353-122456-0013 BUT PRIDE BUT SELF LOVE BUT MADNESS SILENCED THIS VOICE AND STIFLED ITS MURMURS AND THEN OUR GASCON WITH THAT LARGE QUANTITY OF CONCEIT WHICH WE KNOW HE POSSESSED COMPARED HIMSELF WITH DE WARDES
1353-122456-0014 AND ASKED HIMSELF WHY AFTER ALL HE SHOULD NOT BE BELOVED FOR HIMSELF HE WAS ABSORBED ENTIRELY BY THE SENSATIONS OF THE MOMENT MILADY WAS NO LONGER FOR HIM THAT WOMAN OF FATAL INTENTIONS WHO HAD FOR A MOMENT TERRIFIED HIM
1353-122456-0015 WAS THE FIRST TO RETURN TO REALITY AND ASKED THE YOUNG MAN IF THE MEANS WHICH WERE ON THE MORROW TO BRING ON THE ENCOUNTER BETWEEN HIM AND DE WARDES WERE ALREADY ARRANGED IN HIS MIND
1353-122456-0016 BUT D'ARTAGNAN WHOSE IDEAS HAD TAKEN QUITE ANOTHER COURSE FORGOT HIMSELF LIKE A FOOL AND ANSWERED GALLANTLY THAT IT WAS TOO LATE TO THINK ABOUT DUELS AND SWORD THRUSTS THIS COLDNESS TOWARD THE ONLY INTERESTS THAT OCCUPIED HER MIND
1353-122456-0017 WHOSE QUESTIONS BECAME MORE PRESSING THEN D'ARTAGNAN WHO HAD NEVER SERIOUSLY THOUGHT OF THIS IMPOSSIBLE DUEL ENDEAVORED TO TURN THE CONVERSATION BUT HE COULD NOT SUCCEED MILADY KEPT HIM WITHIN THE LIMITS SHE HAD TRACED BEFOREHAND
1353-122456-0018 WITH HER IRRESISTIBLE SPIRIT AND HER IRON WILL
1353-122456-0019 BY PARDONING DE WARDES THE FURIOUS PROJECTS SHE HAD FORMED BUT AT THE FIRST WORD THE YOUNG WOMAN STARTED AND EXCLAIMED IN A SHARP BANTERING TONE WHICH SOUNDED STRANGELY IN THE DARKNESS
1353-122456-0020 ARE YOU AFRAID DEAR MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN YOU CANNOT THINK SO DEAR LOVE REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN BUT NOW SUPPOSE THIS POOR COMTE DE WARDES WERE LESS GUILTY THAN YOU THINK HIM
1353-122456-0021 AND FROM THE MOMENT HE DECEIVED ME HE MERITED DEATH HE SHALL DIE THEN SINCE YOU CONDEMN HIM SAID D'ARTAGNAN
1353-122456-0022 BUT D'ARTAGNAN BELIEVED IT TO BE HARDLY TWO HOURS BEFORE THE DAYLIGHT PEEPED THROUGH THE WINDOW BLINDS AND INVADED THE CHAMBER WITH ITS PALENESS SEEING D'ARTAGNAN ABOUT TO LEAVE HER
1353-122456-0023 I AM QUITE READY SAID D'ARTAGNAN BUT IN THE FIRST PLACE I SHOULD LIKE TO BE CERTAIN OF ONE THING
1353-122456-0024 THAT IS WHETHER YOU REALLY LOVE ME I HAVE GIVEN YOU PROOF OF THAT IT SEEMS TO ME AND I AM YOURS BODY AND SOUL THANKS MY BRAVE LOVER
1353-122456-0025 BUT AS YOU ARE SATISFIED OF MY LOVE YOU MUST IN YOUR TURN SATISFY ME OF YOURS IS IT NOT SO CERTAINLY BUT IF YOU LOVE ME AS MUCH AS YOU SAY REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN DO YOU NOT ENTERTAIN A LITTLE FEAR ON MY ACCOUNT
1353-122456-0026 WHAT HAVE I TO FEAR WHY THAT I MAY BE DANGEROUSLY WOUNDED KILLED EVEN
1353-122456-0027 YOU ARE SUCH A VALIANT MAN AND SUCH AN EXPERT SWORDSMAN YOU WOULD NOT THEN PREFER A METHOD RESUMED D'ARTAGNAN WHICH WOULD EQUALLY AVENGE YOU WHILE RENDERING THE COMBAT USELESS
1353-122456-0028 THE PALE LIGHT OF THE FIRST RAYS OF DAY GAVE TO HER CLEAR EYES A STRANGELY FRIGHTFUL EXPRESSION REALLY SAID SHE I BELIEVE YOU NOW BEGIN TO HESITATE
1353-122456-0029 NO I DO NOT HESITATE BUT I REALLY PITY THIS POOR COMTE DE WARDES SINCE YOU HAVE CEASED TO LOVE HIM I THINK THAT A MAN MUST BE SO SEVERELY PUNISHED BY THE LOSS OF YOUR LOVE THAT HE STANDS IN NEED OF NO OTHER CHASTISEMENT
1353-122456-0030 WHO TOLD YOU THAT I LOVED HIM ASKED MILADY SHARPLY AT LEAST I AM NOW AT LIBERTY TO BELIEVE WITHOUT TOO MUCH FATUITY THAT YOU LOVE ANOTHER SAID THE YOUNG MAN IN A CARESSING TONE AND I REPEAT THAT I AM REALLY INTERESTED FOR THE COUNT
1353-122456-0031 YES I AND WHY YOU BECAUSE I ALONE KNOW WHAT THAT HE IS FAR FROM BEING OR RATHER HAVING BEEN SO GUILTY TOWARD YOU AS HE APPEARS
1353-122456-0032 YES I AM A MAN OF HONOR SAID D'ARTAGNAN DETERMINED TO COME TO AN END AND SINCE YOUR LOVE IS MINE AND I AM SATISFIED I POSSESS IT FOR I DO POSSESS IT DO I NOT ENTIRELY GO ON
1353-122456-0033 WELL I FEEL AS IF TRANSFORMED A CONFESSION WEIGHS ON MY MIND A CONFESSION IF I HAD THE LEAST DOUBT OF YOUR LOVE I WOULD NOT MAKE IT BUT YOU LOVE ME MY BEAUTIFUL MISTRESS DO YOU NOT
1353-122456-0034 WITHOUT DOUBT THEN IF THROUGH EXCESS OF LOVE I HAVE RENDERED MYSELF CULPABLE TOWARD YOU YOU WILL PARDON ME PERHAPS
1353-122456-0035 BUT SHE EVADED HIM THIS CONFESSION SAID SHE GROWING PALER WHAT IS THIS CONFESSION YOU GAVE DE WARDES A MEETING ON THURSDAY LAST IN THIS VERY ROOM DID YOU NOT NO
1353-122456-0036 THAT IF D'ARTAGNAN HAD NOT BEEN IN SUCH PERFECT POSSESSION OF THE FACT HE WOULD HAVE DOUBTED DO NOT LIE MY ANGEL SAID D'ARTAGNAN SMILING THAT WOULD BE USELESS WHAT DO YOU MEAN SPEAK YOU KILL ME
1353-122456-0037 BE SATISFIED YOU ARE NOT GUILTY TOWARD ME AND I HAVE ALREADY PARDONED YOU WHAT NEXT WHAT NEXT DE WARDES CANNOT BOAST OF ANYTHING HOW IS THAT YOU TOLD ME YOURSELF THAT THAT RING
1353-122456-0038 AND THE D'ARTAGNAN OF TODAY ARE THE SAME PERSON THE IMPRUDENT YOUNG MAN EXPECTED A SURPRISE MIXED WITH SHAME A SLIGHT STORM WHICH WOULD RESOLVE ITSELF INTO TEARS BUT HE WAS STRANGELY DECEIVED
1353-122456-0039 AND HIS ERROR WAS NOT OF LONG DURATION
1353-122456-0040 AS SHE SPRANG OUT OF BED IT WAS ALMOST BROAD DAYLIGHT D'ARTAGNAN DETAINED HER BY HER NIGHT DRESS OF FINE INDIA LINEN TO IMPLORE HER PARDON BUT SHE WITH A STRONG MOVEMENT TRIED TO ESCAPE
1353-122456-0041 AND ON ONE OF THOSE LOVELY SHOULDERS ROUND AND WHITE D'ARTAGNAN RECOGNIZED WITH INEXPRESSIBLE ASTONISHMENT
1353-122456-0042 THAT INDELIBLE MARK WHICH THE HAND OF THE INFAMOUS EXECUTIONER HAD IMPRINTED GREAT GOD CRIED D'ARTAGNAN LOOSING HIS HOLD OF HER DRESS AND REMAINING MUTE MOTIONLESS AND FROZEN
1353-122456-0043 HE HAD DOUBTLESS SEEN ALL THE YOUNG MAN NOW KNEW HER SECRET HER TERRIBLE SECRET THE SECRET SHE CONCEALED EVEN FROM HER MAID WITH SUCH CARE THE SECRET OF WHICH ALL THE WORLD WAS IGNORANT EXCEPT HIMSELF SHE TURNED UPON HIM
1353-122456-0044 OPENED IT WITH A FEVERISH AND TREMBLING HAND DREW FROM IT A SMALL PONIARD WITH A GOLDEN HAFT AND A SHARP THIN BLADE AND THEN THREW HERSELF WITH A BOUND UPON D'ARTAGNAN
1353-122456-0045 SHE THEN TRIED TO SEIZE THE SWORD WITH HER HANDS BUT D'ARTAGNAN KEPT IT FREE FROM HER GRASP AND PRESENTING THE POINT SOMETIMES AT HER EYES SOMETIMES AT HER BREAST COMPELLED HER TO GLIDE BEHIND THE BEDSTEAD
1353-122456-0046 WHILE HE AIMED AT MAKING HIS RETREAT BY THE DOOR WHICH LED TO KITTY'S APARTMENT
1353-122456-0047 SCREAMING IN A FORMIDABLE WAY AS ALL THIS HOWEVER BORE SOME RESEMBLANCE TO A DUEL D'ARTAGNAN BEGAN TO RECOVER HIMSELF LITTLE BY LITTLE WELL BEAUTIFUL LADY VERY WELL SAID HE
1353-122456-0048 BUT D'ARTAGNAN STILL KEEPING ON THE DEFENSIVE DREW NEAR TO KITTY'S DOOR AT THE NOISE THEY MADE SHE IN OVERTURNING THE FURNITURE IN HER EFFORTS TO GET AT HIM HE IN SCREENING HIMSELF BEHIND THE FURNITURE TO KEEP OUT OF HER REACH KITTY OPENED THE DOOR
1353-122456-0049 D'ARTAGNAN WHO HAD UNCEASINGLY MANEUVERED TO GAIN THIS POINT WAS NOT AT MORE THAN THREE PACES FROM IT
1353-122456-0050 QUICK KITTY QUICK SAID D'ARTAGNAN IN A LOW VOICE AS SOON AS THE BOLTS WERE FAST
1353-122456-0051 FOR IF WE LEAVE HER TIME TO TURN ROUND SHE WILL HAVE ME KILLED BY THE SERVANTS BUT YOU CAN'T GO OUT SO SAID KITTY YOU ARE NAKED THAT'S TRUE SAID D'ARTAGNAN THEN FIRST THINKING OF THE COSTUME HE FOUND HIMSELF IN

1353-122456-0053 KITTY WAS BUT TOO WELL AWARE OF THAT IN A TURN OF THE HAND SHE MUFFLED HIM UP IN A FLOWERED ROBE A LARGE HOOD AND A CLOAK SHE GAVE HIM SOME SLIPPERS IN WHICH HE PLACED HIS NAKED FEET AND THEN CONDUCTED HIM DOWN THE STAIRS
1353-122456-0054 IT WAS TIME MILADY HAD ALREADY RUNG HER BELL AND ROUSED THE WHOLE HOTEL
