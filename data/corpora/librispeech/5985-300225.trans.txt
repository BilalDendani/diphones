5985-300225-0000 AN UNUSUAL HONOR
5985-300225-0001 THE ORDEAL OF THE NEXT FEW DAYS WAS A SEVERE ONE ON THE ONE HAND JEFF WAIN'S INFATUATION HAD RAPIDLY INCREASED IN VIEW OF HER SPEEDY DEPARTURE FROM MISSUS TRYON'S REMARK ABOUT WAIN'S WIFE AMANDA
5985-300225-0002 AND FROM THINGS RENA HAD SINCE LEARNED SHE HAD EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WIFE WAS LIVING AND THAT WAIN MUST BE AWARE OF THE FACT IN THE LIGHT OF THIS KNOWLEDGE
5985-300225-0003 WAIN'S FORMER CONDUCT TOOK ON A BLACKER SIGNIFICANCE THAN UPON REFLECTION SHE HAD CHARITABLY CLOTHED IT WITH AFTER THE FIRST FLUSH OF INDIGNATION
5985-300225-0004 AND WITH AMANDA ALIVE HIS ATTENTIONS ALWAYS OFFENSIVE SINCE SHE HAD GATHERED THEIR IMPORT BECAME IN HER EYES THE EXPRESSION OF A VILLAINOUS PURPOSE OF WHICH SHE COULD NOT SPEAK TO OTHERS AND FROM WHICH SHE FELT SAFE
5985-300225-0005 ONLY SO LONG AS SHE TOOK PROPER PRECAUTIONS AGAINST IT IN A WEEK HER SCHOOL WOULD BE OVER AND THEN SHE WOULD GET ELDER JOHNSON OR SOME ONE ELSE THAN WAIN TO TAKE HER BACK TO PATESVILLE
5985-300225-0006 SHE WOULD LOSE HER SALARY FOR THE MONTH EXPLANATIONS WOULD BE NECESSARY AND WOULD NOT BE FORTHCOMING SHE MIGHT FEIGN SICKNESS INDEED IT WOULD SCARCELY BE FEIGNING FOR SHE FELT FAR FROM WELL
5985-300225-0007 SHE HAD NEVER SINCE HER ILLNESS QUITE RECOVERED HER FORMER VIGOR BUT THE INCONVENIENCE TO OTHERS WOULD BE THE SAME AND HER SELF SACRIFICE WOULD HAVE HAD AT ITS VERY FIRST TRIAL A LAME AND IMPOTENT CONCLUSION
5985-300225-0008 SHE HAD AS YET NO FEAR OF PERSONAL VIOLENCE FROM WAIN BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES HIS ATTENTIONS WERE AN INSULT HE WAS EVIDENTLY BENT UPON CONQUEST AND VAIN ENOUGH TO THINK HE MIGHT ACHIEVE IT BY VIRTUE OF HIS PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS
5985-300225-0009 IF HE COULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD HOW SHE LOATHED THE SIGHT OF HIS NARROW EYES WITH THEIR PUFFY LIDS HIS THICK TOBACCO STAINED LIPS HIS DOUBTFUL TEETH AND HIS UNWIELDY PERSON WAIN A MONUMENT OF CONCEIT THAT HE WAS
5985-300225-0010 MIGHT HAVE SHRUNK EVEN IN HIS OWN ESTIMATION TO SOMETHING LIKE HIS REAL PROPORTIONS RENA BELIEVED THAT TO DEFEND HERSELF FROM PERSECUTION AT HIS HANDS IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY THAT SHE NEVER LET HIM FIND HER ALONE
5985-300225-0011 THIS HOWEVER REQUIRED CONSTANT WATCHFULNESS RELYING UPON HIS OWN POWERS AND UPON A WOMAN'S WEAKNESS AND AVERSION TO SCANDAL FROM WHICH NOT EVEN THE PUREST MAY ALWAYS ESCAPE UNSCATHED
5985-300225-0012 AND CONVINCED BY HER FORMER SILENCE THAT HE HAD NOTHING SERIOUS TO FEAR WAIN MADE IT A POINT TO BE PRESENT AT EVERY PUBLIC PLACE WHERE SHE MIGHT BE HE ASSUMED IN CONVERSATION WITH HER WHICH SHE COULD NOT AVOID
5985-300225-0013 AND STATED TO OTHERS THAT SHE HAD LEFT HIS HOUSE BECAUSE OF A PREVIOUS PROMISE TO DIVIDE THE TIME OF HER STAY BETWEEN ELDER JOHNSON'S HOUSE AND HIS OWN HE VOLUNTEERED TO TEACH A CLASS IN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL WHICH RENA CONDUCTED AT THE COLORED METHODIST CHURCH
5985-300225-0014 AND WHEN SHE REMAINED TO SERVICE OCCUPIED A SEAT CONSPICUOUSLY NEAR HER OWN IN ADDITION TO THESE PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE OR IT SEEMED WITH SO THICK SKINNED AN INDIVIDUAL AS WAIN EVEN TO DISCOURAGE
5985-300225-0015 SHE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO CRUSH ONCE OR TWICE A WILD HOPE THAT HER SECRET BEING STILL UNKNOWN SAVE TO A FRIENDLY FEW HE MIGHT RETURN AND CLAIM HER NOW SUCH AN OUTCOME WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
5985-300225-0016 HE WOULD NEVER HAVE FORGOTTEN HER IN THREE SHORT MONTHS THREE LONG MONTHS THEY HAD HERETOFORE SEEMED TO HER FOR IN THEM SHE HAD LIVED A LIFETIME OF EXPERIENCE ANOTHER IMPASSABLE BARRIER LAY IN THE FACT THAT HIS MOTHER HAD MET HER
5985-300225-0017 AND THAT SHE WAS KNOWN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THUS CUT OFF FROM ANY HOPE THAT SHE MIGHT BE ANYTHING TO HIM SHE HAD NO WISH TO MEET HER FORMER LOVER NO POSSIBLE GOOD COULD COME OF SUCH A MEETING AND YET HER FLUTTERING HEART TOLD HER THAT IF HE SHOULD COME
5985-300225-0018 AS HIS LETTER FORESHADOWED THAT HE MIGHT IF HE SHOULD COME THE LOVING GEORGE OF OLD WITH SOFT WORDS AND TENDER SMILES AND SPECIOUS TALK OF FRIENDSHIP AH THEN HER HEART WOULD BREAK SHE MUST NOT MEET HIM
5985-300225-0019 AT ANY COST SHE MUST AVOID HIM BUT THIS HEAPING UP OF CARES STRAINED HER ENDURANCE TO THE BREAKING POINT TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST WEEK SHE KNEW THAT SHE HAD ALMOST REACHED THE LIMIT
5985-300225-0020 AND WAS HAUNTED BY A FEAR THAT SHE MIGHT BREAK DOWN BEFORE THE WEEK WAS OVER NOW HER REALLY FINE NATURE ROSE TO THE EMERGENCY THOUGH SHE MUSTERED HER FORCES WITH A GREAT EFFORT
