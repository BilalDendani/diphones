8006-112592-0000 FOR TEACHERS AND SCHOLARS WERE NOW ALL CHRISTIANS BUT AS SOON AS SAINT PATRICK CAME A NEW CLASS OF SCHOOLS BEGAN TO SPRING UP
8006-112592-0001 WERE CALLED LAY SCHOOLS IN LAY SCHOOLS WAS TAUGHT WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED THE NATIVE LEARNING THE LEARNING THAT HAD GROWN UP IN THE COUNTRY IN THE COURSE OF AGES
8006-112592-0002 IT CONSISTED MAINLY OF THE FOLLOWING SUBJECTS TO READ AND WRITE THE IRISH LANGUAGE IRISH GRAMMAR AND RULES OF POETICAL COMPOSITION A VERY EXTENSIVE AND COMPLICATED SUBJECT
8006-112592-0003 GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORY ESPECIALLY THE TOPOGRAPHY AND HISTORY OF IRELAND AND A KNOWLEDGE OF THE POETRY AND OF THE HISTORICAL AND ROMANTIC TALES OF THE COUNTRY
8006-112592-0004 WHILE A GREAT MANY OF THE SCHOOLS WERE FOR PROFESSIONS SPECIAL SCHOOLS OF LAW OF MEDICINE OF POETRY OF HISTORY AND ANTIQUITIES AND SO FORTH IN THESE LAST
8006-112592-0005 THE PROFESSIONAL MEN WERE EDUCATED THESE LAY SCHOOLS BEING NOW WITHIN THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNION WERE NOT ABOLISHED OR DISCOURAGED IN ANY WAY BY SAINT PATRICK OR HIS SUCCESSORS
8006-112592-0006 THEY WERE SIMPLY LET ALONE TO TEACH THEIR OWN SECULAR LEARNING JUST AS THEY PLEASED THEY CONTINUED ON AND WERE TO BE FOUND IN EVERY PART OF IRELAND FOR FOURTEEN CENTURIES AFTER SAINT PATRICK'S ARRIVAL
8006-112592-0007 DOWN TO A PERIOD WITHIN OUR OWN MEMORY BUT OF COURSE GREATLY CHANGED AS TIME WENT ON IN LATER TIMES THEY WERE MUCH MORE NUMEROUS IN MUNSTER
8006-112592-0008 AND THEY TAUGHT AND TAUGHT WELL CLASSICS AND MATHEMATICS AND OFTEN BOTH COMBINED IN THE SAME SCHOOL I WAS MYSELF EDUCATED IN SOME OF THOSE LAY SCHOOLS AND I REMEMBER WITH PLEASURE
8006-112592-0009 SEVERAL OF MY OLD TEACHERS ROUGH AND UNPOLISHED MEN MOST OF THEM BUT EXCELLENT SOLID SCHOLARS AND FULL OF ENTHUSIASM FOR LEARNING ENTHUSIASM WHICH THEY COMMUNICATED TO THEIR PUPILS
8006-112592-0010 IN SOME RESPECTS INDEED THEY RESEMBLED THE RUGGED EARNEST SCHOLARLY IRISHMEN OF OLD TIMES WHO TRAVELLED THROUGH EUROPE TO SPREAD RELIGION AND LEARNING
8006-112592-0011 FARTHER ON BUT THE FAMINE OF EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN BROKE UP THOSE SCHOOLS AND IN A VERY FEW YEARS THEY NEARLY ALL DISAPPEARED BUT OUR BUSINESS HERE IS MAINLY WITH THE EARLY MONASTIC SCHOOLS
8006-112592-0012 WHICH BECAME SO CELEBRATED ALL OVER EUROPE BEFORE GOING FARTHER IT IS WELL TO REMARK THAT THESE SCHOOLS ALSO CONTINUED AND INCREASED AND MULTIPLIED AS TIME WENT ON
8006-112592-0013 THEY HELD THEIR GROUND SUCCESSFULLY AS THE LAY SCHOOLS DID DURING THE EVIL DAYS OF LATER AGES WHEN DETERMINED ATTEMPTS WERE MADE UNDER THE PENAL LAWS TO SUPPRESS THEM AND AT THE PRESENT DAY
8006-112592-0014 THEY ARE WORKING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY QUITE AS VIGOROUSLY AS IN DAYS OF YORE TO NOTICE ALL THE MONASTIC SCHOOLS OF OLD THAT ATTAINED EMINENCE WOULD DEMAND MORE SPACE THAN CAN BE AFFORDED HERE
8006-112592-0015 SO WE MUST CONTENT OURSELVES WITH MENTIONING THE FOLLOWING ALL OF WHICH WERE VERY ILLUSTRIOUS IN THEIR TIME
8006-112592-0016 CLONMACNOISE ARMAGH KILDARE CLONARD MEATH CLONFERT GALWAY DURROW
8006-112592-0017 MONASTERBOICE NEAR DROGHEDA
8006-112592-0018 AND DERRY BESIDES THESE AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE OTHERS ALL EMINENT ARE SPECIALLY MENTIONED IN OUR OLD BOOKS MOST OF THESE COLLEGES WERE WORKING NOT IN SUCCESSION
8006-112592-0019 FROM THE SIXTH CENTURY DOWNWARDS WHEN WE BEAR IN MIND THAT THERE WERE ALSO DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD THE LAY SCHOOLS WHICH THOUGH SMALLER WERE FAR MORE NUMEROUS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
8006-112592-0020 IN PROPORTION TO SIZE AND POPULATION MANY OF THE MONASTIC COLLEGES HAD VERY LARGE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS IN CLONARD THERE WERE THREE THOUSAND ALL RESIDING IN AND AROUND THE COLLEGE
8006-112592-0021 AND BANGOR FOUNDED BY SAINT COMGALL AND CLONFERT FOUNDED BY SAINT BRENDAN THE NAVIGATOR HAD EACH AS MANY
8006-112592-0022 ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOWN TO FIFTY THE STUDENTS WERE OF ALL CLASSES RICH AND POOR FROM THE SONS OF KINGS AND CHIEFS DOWN TO THE SONS OF FARMERS TRADESMEN AND LABOURERS
8006-112592-0023 YOUNG LAYMEN FOR GENERAL EDUCATION AS WELL AS ECCLESIASTICAL STUDENTS FOR THE PRIESTHOOD ALL THOSE WHO HAD THE MEANS PAID THEIR WAY IN EVERYTHING
8006-112592-0024 AND THESE POOR SCHOLARS AS THEY AFTERWARDS CAME TO BE CALLED RECEIVED TEACHING BOOKS AND OFTEN FOOD ALL FREE BUT MOST OF EVEN THE POOREST DID THEIR BEST TO PAY SOMETHING
8006-112592-0025 AND IN THIS RESPECT IT IS INTERESTING TO COMPARE THE USAGES OF THOSE LONG PAST TIMES WITH SOME FEATURES OF THE COLLEGE LIFE OF OUR OWN DAYS IN SOME OF THE PRESENT AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES
8006-112592-0026 THERE IS AN EXCELLENT CUSTOM WHICH ENABLES VERY POOR STUDENTS TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND PAY THEIR COLLEGE FEES THEY WAIT ON THEIR RICHER COMRADES BRING UP THE DISHES ET CETERA FROM THE KITCHEN FOR MEALS
8006-112592-0027 AND LAY THE TABLES AND WHEN THE MEAL IS OVER THEY REMOVE EVERYTHING WASH UP DISHES AND PLATES AND PUT THEM ALL BY IN THEIR PROPER PLACES IN FACT THEY PERFORM MOST OF THE WORK EXPECTED FROM ORDINARY SERVANTS
8006-112592-0028 FOR THIS THEY RECEIVE FOOD AND SOME SMALL PAYMENT WHICH RENDERS THEM INDEPENDENT OF CHARITY AND THE PLEASING FEATURE OF THIS ARRANGEMENT IS
8006-112592-0029 THAT IT IS NOT ATTENDED WITH ANY SENSE OF HUMILIATION OR LOSS OF SELF RESPECT DURING STUDY AND LECTURE HOURS THESE SAME YOUNG MEN HAVING PUT BY APRONS AND NAPKINS AND DONNED THEIR ORDINARY DRESS
8006-112592-0030 ARE RECEIVED AND TREATED ON TERMS OF PERFECT EQUALITY BY THOSE THEY HAVE SERVED WHO TAKE ON NO AIRS AND DO NOT POSE AS SUPERIORS BUT MIX WITH THEM IN FREE AND KINDLY INTERCOURSE AS FELLOW STUDENTS AND COMRADES
8006-112592-0031 FOR WHICH THEY RECEIVED FOOD AND OTHER KINDS OF PAYMENT MANY OF THESE YOUTHS WHO SERVED IN THIS HUMBLE CAPACITY SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME GREAT AND LEARNED MEN AS INDEED WE MIGHT EXPECT
8006-112592-0032 FOR BOYS OF THIS STAMP ARE MADE OF THE BEST STUFF AND SOME OF THEM ARE NOW FAMED IN OUR RECORDS AS EMINENT FATHERS OF THE ANCIENT IRISH CHURCH THE GREATEST NUMBER OF THE STUDENTS LIVED IN HOUSES BUILT BY THEMSELVES
8006-112592-0033 OR BY HIRED WORKMEN SOME MERE HUTS EACH FOR A SINGLE PERSON SOME LARGE HOUSES FOR SEVERAL AND ALL AROUND THE CENTRAL COLLEGE BUILDINGS THERE WERE WHOLE STREETS OF THESE HOUSES
8006-112592-0034 OFTEN FORMING A GOOD SIZED TOWN WHERE THERE WERE LARGE NUMBERS GREAT CARE WAS TAKEN THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO CONFUSION OR DISORDER THE WHOLE SCHOOL WAS COMMONLY DIVIDED INTO SECTIONS
8006-112592-0035 OVER EACH OF WHICH WAS PLACED A LEADER OR MASTER WHOSE ORDERS SHOULD BE OBEYED AND OVER THE WHOLE COLLEGE THERE WAS ONE HEAD MASTER OR PRINCIPAL USUALLY CALLED A FER LEGINN
8006-112592-0036 WHILE THE ABBOT PRESIDED OVER ALL MONASTERY AND COLLEGE THE FER LEGINN WAS ALWAYS SOME DISTINGUISHED MAN OF COURSE A GREAT SCHOLAR HE WAS GENERALLY A MONK BUT SOMETIMES A LAYMAN
8006-112592-0037 FOR THOSE GOOD MONKS SELECTED THE BEST MAN THEY COULD FIND WHETHER PRIEST OR LAYMAN I SUPPOSE THOSE WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO THE GRAND UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES OF THE PRESENT DAY WITH THEIR PALATIAL BUILDINGS
8006-112592-0038 OF THE OLD IRISH COLLEGES THERE WERE NO COMFORTABLE STUDY ROOMS WELL FURNISHED WITH DESKS SEATS AND ROSTRUMS NO SPACIOUS LECTURE HALLS THE GREATER PART OF THE WORK INDEED WAS CARRIED ON IN THE OPEN AIR
8006-112592-0039 WHEN THE WEATHER AT ALL PERMITTED AT STUDY TIME THE STUDENTS WENT JUST WHERE THEY PLEASED AND ACCOMMODATED THEMSELVES AS BEST THEY COULD ALL ROUND THE COLLEGE YOU WOULD SEE EVERY FLOWERY BANK EVERY SCENTED HEDGEROW
8006-112592-0040 EVERY GREEN GLADE AND SUNNY HILLOCK OCCUPIED WITH STUDENTS SITTING OR LYING DOWN OR PACING THOUGHTFULLY EACH WITH HIS PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPT BOOK OPEN BEFORE HIM ALL PORING OVER THE LESSON ASSIGNED FOR NEXT LECTURE
8006-112592-0041 AND THE SPECIAL STUDENTS FOR THIS HURRIED TO THEIR PLACES AND SEATED THEMSELVES AS BEST THEY COULD ON CHAIR STOOL FORM STONE OR BANK AND OPENED THEIR BOOKS
8006-112592-0042 THESE SAME BOOKS TOO WERE A MOTLEY COLLECTION SOME LARGE SOME SMALL SOME FRESH FROM THE SCRIBE SOME TATTERED AND BROWN WITH AGE BUT ALL MOST CAREFULLY COVERED AND PRESERVED
8006-112592-0043 FOR THEY WERE VERY EXPENSIVE YOU NOW BUY A GOOD SCHOOL COPY OF SOME CLASSICAL AUTHOR FOR SAY HALF A CROWN AT THAT TIME IT WOULD PROBABLY COST WHAT WAS EQUIVALENT
8006-112592-0044 OF OUR PRESENT MONEY THEN THE MASTER WENT OVER THE TEXT TRANSLATING AND EXPLAINING IT AND WHENEVER HE THOUGHT IT NECESSARY QUESTIONED HIS PUPILS TO DRAW THEM OUT
8006-112592-0045 AFTER THIS HE HAD TO STAND THE CROSS FIRE OF THE STUDENTS QUESTIONS WHO ASKED HIM TO EXPLAIN ALL SORTS OF DIFFICULTIES FOR THIS WAS ONE OF THE COLLEGE REGULATIONS
8006-112592-0046 THERE WERE NO GRAMMARS NO DICTIONARIES NO SIMPLE INTRODUCTORY LESSON BOOKS SUCH AS WE HAVE NOW THE STUDENTS HAD TO GO STRAIGHT AT THE LATIN OR GREEK TEXT AND WHERE THEY FAILED TO MAKE SENSE
8006-112592-0047 ALL OVER EUROPE AND WHO FOR THE PERIOD WHEN THEY LIVED ARE NOW HONOURED AS AMONG THE GREATEST SCHOLARS AND MISSIONARIES THAT THE WORLD EVER SAW THE GREAT IRISH COLLEGES WERE IN FACT UNIVERSITIES IN THE FULL SENSE OF THE WORD
8006-112592-0048 THAT IS TO SAY SCHOOLS WHICH TAUGHT THE WHOLE CIRCLE OF KNOWLEDGE THEY WERE INDEED IN A GREAT MEASURE THE MODELS ON WHICH OUR PRESENT UNIVERSITIES WERE FORMED
8006-112592-0049 THE LATIN AND GREEK LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES WERE STUDIED AND TAUGHT WITH SUCCESS IN SCIENCE THE IRISH SCHOLARS WERE FAMOUS FOR THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF GEOMETRY ARITHMETIC ASTRONOMY
8006-112592-0050 MUSIC GEOGRAPHY AND SO FORTH AND THEY WERE EQUALLY EMINENT IN SACRED LEARNING THEOLOGY DIVINITY AND THE HOLY SCRIPTURES THE SCHOOLS PROVED THEIR METTLE BY THE SCHOLARS THEY EDUCATED AND SENT FORTH
8006-112592-0051 SCHOLARS WHO ASTONISHED ALL EUROPE IN THEIR DAY SEDULIUS OF THE FIFTH CENTURY WHOSE NAME IS STILL REPRESENTED BY THE FAMILY NAME SHIEL AN EMINENT DIVINE ORATOR AND POET
8006-112592-0052 AND COMPOSED SOME BEAUTIFUL LATIN HYMNS WHICH ARE STILL USED IN THE SERVICES OF THE CHURCH
8006-112592-0053 IN QUEEN'S COUNTY TO FRANCE WHERE HE BECAME FAMOUS FOR HIS DEEP SCIENTIFIC LEARNING AND WHERE HE TAUGHT PUBLICLY AND PROBABLY FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE EARTH IS ROUND HAVING PEOPLE LIVING ON THE OTHER SIDE
8006-112592-0054 JOHN SCOTUS ERIGENA JOHN THE IRISH BORN SCOT OF THE NINTH CENTURY TAUGHT IN PARIS HE WAS THE GREATEST GREEK SCHOLAR OF HIS TIME AND WAS EQUALLY EMINENT IN THEOLOGY
8006-112592-0055 SAINT COLUMBANUS OF BOBBIO IN ITALY A LEINSTERMAN A PUPIL OF THE COLLEGE OF BANGOR PROVED HIMSELF WHILE IN FRANCE AND ITALY A MASTER OF MANY KINDS OF LEARNING
8006-112592-0056 AND WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST MOST FEARLESS AND MOST SUCCESSFUL OF THE IRISH MISSIONARIES ON THE CONTINENT THESE MEN AND SCORES OF OTHERS THAT WE CANNOT FIND SPACE FOR HERE
8006-112592-0057 SPREAD THE FAME OF THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY EVERYWHERE IT WAS NO WONDER THAT THE PEOPLE OF GREAT BRITAIN AND THE CONTINENT WHEN THEY MET SUCH SCHOLARS ALL FROM IRELAND CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE SCHOOLS WHICH EDUCATED THEM
8006-112592-0058 WERE THE BEST TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE ACCORDINGLY STUDENTS CAME FROM ALL PARTS OF THE KNOWN WORLD TO PLACE THEMSELVES UNDER THE MASTERS OF THESE SCHOOLS FROM GERMANY FRANCE ITALY EGYPT
8006-112592-0059 CAME PRIESTS AND LAYMEN PRINCES CHIEFS AND PEASANT STUDENTS ALL EAGERLY SEEKING TO DRINK FROM THE FOUNTAIN OF IRISH LEARNING AND LET US BEAR IN MIND THAT IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS A FAR MORE DIFFICULT
8006-112592-0060 DANGEROUS AND TEDIOUS UNDERTAKING TO TRAVEL TO IRELAND FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT THAN IT IS NOW TO GO TO AUSTRALIA OR CHINA
8006-112592-0061 BUT EVEN IN MUCH GREATER NUMBERS THAN THESE CAME STUDENTS FROM GREAT BRITAIN AN ENGLISH WRITER OF THAT PERIOD
8006-112592-0062 WITH HIS COUNTRYMEN FOR COMING TO THEM IS NEVERTHELESS FORCED TO ADMIT THAT ENGLISHMEN CAME TO IRELAND IN FLEETLOADS IN OUR HISTORIES OF IRELAND WE HAVE READ OF THE REAL IRISH WELCOME THEY RECEIVED
8006-112592-0063 AS RECORDED BY THE VENERABLE BEDE AND BY OTHERS AND HOW THE IRISH NOT ONLY TAUGHT THEM BUT GAVE THEM BOOKS AND FOOD FOR NOTHING AT ALL IT WAS QUITE A COMMON THING THAT YOUNG ENGLISHMEN
8006-112592-0064 CAME TO IRELAND TO FINISH THEIR EDUCATION THE MORE THE STUDENTS CROWDED TO THE IRISH SCHOOLS WHETHER FROM IRELAND ITSELF OR FROM ABROAD THE MORE EAGERLY DID THE MASTERS STRIVE TO MEET THE DEMAND
8006-112592-0065 SO AS TO EQUAL OR EXCEL THE SCHOLARS OF OTHER COUNTRIES THEN IRELAND BECAME THE MOST LEARNED COUNTRY IN EUROPE
