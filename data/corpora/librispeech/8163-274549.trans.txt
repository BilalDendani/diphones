8163-274549-0000 MARTIN LUTHER HORROR AND FATALITY HAVE BEEN STALKING ABROAD IN ALL AGES WHY THEN GIVE A DATE TO THIS STORY I HAVE TO TELL
8163-274549-0001 LET IT SUFFICE TO SAY THAT AT THE PERIOD OF WHICH I SPEAK THERE EXISTED IN THE INTERIOR OF HUNGARY A SETTLED ALTHOUGH HIDDEN BELIEF IN THE DOCTRINES OF THE METEMPSYCHOSIS
8163-274549-0002 OF THE DOCTRINES THEMSELVES THAT IS OF THEIR FALSITY OR OF THEIR PROBABILITY I SAY NOTHING I ASSERT HOWEVER THAT MUCH OF OUR INCREDULITY
8163-274549-0003 WHICH WERE FAST VERGING TO ABSURDITY THEY THE HUNGARIANS DIFFERED VERY ESSENTIALLY FROM THEIR EASTERN AUTHORITIES FOR EXAMPLE THE SOUL SAID THE FORMER
8163-274549-0004 THE ORIGIN OF THIS ENMITY SEEMS TO BE FOUND IN THE WORDS OF AN ANCIENT PROPHECY A LOFTY NAME SHALL HAVE A FEARFUL FALL WHEN AS THE RIDER OVER HIS HORSE
8163-274549-0005 THE MORTALITY OF METZENGERSTEIN SHALL TRIUMPH OVER THE IMMORTALITY OF BERLIFITZING TO BE SURE THE WORDS THEMSELVES HAD LITTLE OR NO MEANING BUT MORE TRIVIAL CAUSES HAVE GIVEN RISE
8163-274549-0006 AND THAT NO LONG WHILE AGO TO CONSEQUENCES EQUALLY EVENTFUL BESIDES THE ESTATES WHICH WERE CONTIGUOUS HAD LONG EXERCISED A RIVAL INFLUENCE IN THE AFFAIRS OF A BUSY GOVERNMENT MOREOVER
8163-274549-0007 NEAR NEIGHBORS ARE SELDOM FRIENDS AND THE INHABITANTS OF THE CASTLE BERLIFITZING MIGHT LOOK FROM THEIR LOFTY BUTTRESSES INTO THE VERY WINDOWS OF THE PALACE METZENGERSTEIN
8163-274549-0008 SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED IN SETTING AND KEEPING AT VARIANCE TWO FAMILIES ALREADY PREDISPOSED TO QUARREL BY EVERY INSTIGATION OF HEREDITARY JEALOUSY THE PROPHECY SEEMED TO IMPLY IF IT IMPLIED ANYTHING
8163-274549-0009 A FINAL TRIUMPH ON THE PART OF THE ALREADY MORE POWERFUL HOUSE AND WAS OF COURSE REMEMBERED WITH THE MORE BITTER ANIMOSITY BY THE WEAKER AND LESS INFLUENTIAL WILHELM COUNT BERLIFITZING
8163-274549-0010 ALTHOUGH LOFTILY DESCENDED WAS AT THE EPOCH OF THIS NARRATIVE AN INFIRM AND DOTING OLD MAN REMARKABLE FOR NOTHING BUT AN INORDINATE AND INVETERATE PERSONAL ANTIPATHY TO THE FAMILY OF HIS RIVAL AND SO PASSIONATE
8163-274549-0011 A LOVE OF HORSES AND OF HUNTING THAT NEITHER BODILY INFIRMITY GREAT AGE NOR MENTAL INCAPACITY PREVENTED HIS DAILY PARTICIPATION IN THE DANGERS OF THE CHASE FREDERICK BARON METZENGERSTEIN
8163-274549-0012 WAS ON THE OTHER HAND NOT YET OF AGE HIS FATHER THE MINISTER G DIED YOUNG HIS MOTHER THE LADY MARY FOLLOWED HIM QUICKLY AFTER FREDERICK WAS AT THAT TIME IN HIS FIFTEENTH YEAR
8163-274549-0013 AT THE DECEASE OF THE FORMER ENTERED IMMEDIATELY UPON HIS VAST POSSESSIONS SUCH ESTATES WERE SELDOM HELD BEFORE BY A NOBLEMAN OF HUNGARY HIS CASTLES WERE WITHOUT NUMBER
8163-274549-0014 THE CHIEF IN POINT OF SPLENDOR AND EXTENT WAS THE CHATEAU METZENGERSTEIN THE BOUNDARY LINE OF HIS DOMINIONS WAS NEVER CLEARLY DEFINED BUT HIS PRINCIPAL PARK EMBRACED A CIRCUIT OF FIFTY MILES
8163-274549-0015 UPON THE SUCCESSION OF A PROPRIETOR SO YOUNG WITH A CHARACTER SO WELL KNOWN TO A FORTUNE SO UNPARALLELED LITTLE SPECULATION WAS AFLOAT IN REGARD TO HIS PROBABLE COURSE OF CONDUCT
8163-274549-0016 SHAMEFUL DEBAUCHERIES FLAGRANT TREACHERIES UNHEARD OF ATROCITIES GAVE HIS TREMBLING VASSALS QUICKLY TO UNDERSTAND THAT NO SERVILE SUBMISSION ON THEIR PART NO PUNCTILIOS OF CONSCIENCE ON HIS OWN
8163-274549-0017 WERE THENCEFORWARD TO PROVE ANY SECURITY AGAINST THE REMORSELESS FANGS OF A PETTY CALIGULA ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTH DAY THE STABLES OF THE CASTLE BERLIFITZING WERE DISCOVERED TO BE ON FIRE
8163-274549-0018 AND THE UNANIMOUS OPINION OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD ADDED THE CRIME OF THE INCENDIARY TO THE ALREADY HIDEOUS LIST OF THE BARON'S MISDEMEANORS AND ENORMITIES
8163-274549-0019 THE RICH ALTHOUGH FADED TAPESTRY HANGINGS WHICH SWUNG GLOOMILY UPON THE WALLS REPRESENTED THE SHADOWY AND MAJESTIC FORMS OF A THOUSAND ILLUSTRIOUS ANCESTORS HERE
8163-274549-0020 RICH ERMINED PRIESTS AND PONTIFICAL DIGNITARIES FAMILIARLY SEATED WITH THE AUTOCRAT AND THE SOVEREIGN PUT A VETO ON THE WISHES OF A TEMPORAL KING
8163-274549-0021 THERE THE DARK TALL STATURES OF THE PRINCES METZENGERSTEIN THEIR MUSCULAR WAR COURSERS PLUNGING OVER THE CARCASSES OF FALLEN FOES STARTLED THE STEADIEST NERVES WITH THEIR VIGOROUS EXPRESSION
8163-274549-0022 BUT AS THE BARON LISTENED OR AFFECTED TO LISTEN TO THE GRADUALLY INCREASING UPROAR IN THE STABLES OF BERLIFITZING OR PERHAPS PONDERED UPON SOME MORE NOVEL SOME MORE DECIDED ACT OF AUDACITY
8163-274549-0023 HIS EYES BECAME UNWITTINGLY RIVETTED TO THE FIGURE OF AN ENORMOUS AND UNNATURALLY COLORED HORSE REPRESENTED IN THE TAPESTRY AS BELONGING TO A SARACEN ANCESTOR OF THE FAMILY OF HIS RIVAL
8163-274549-0024 ON FREDERICK'S LIP AROSE A FIENDISH EXPRESSION AS HE BECAME AWARE OF THE DIRECTION WHICH HIS GLANCE HAD WITHOUT HIS CONSCIOUSNESS ASSUMED YET HE DID NOT REMOVE IT
8163-274549-0025 ON THE CONTRARY HE COULD BY NO MEANS ACCOUNT FOR THE OVERWHELMING ANXIETY WHICH APPEARED FALLING LIKE A PALL UPON HIS SENSES IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT HE RECONCILED HIS DREAMY AND INCOHERENT FEELINGS WITH THE CERTAINTY OF BEING AWAKE
8163-274549-0026 THE LONGER HE GAZED THE MORE ABSORBING BECAME THE SPELL THE MORE IMPOSSIBLE DID IT APPEAR THAT HE COULD EVER WITHDRAW HIS GLANCE FROM THE FASCINATION OF THAT TAPESTRY BUT THE TUMULT WITHOUT BECOMING SUDDENLY MORE VIOLENT
8163-274549-0027 WITH A COMPULSORY EXERTION HE DIVERTED HIS ATTENTION TO THE GLARE OF RUDDY LIGHT THROWN FULL BY THE FLAMING STABLES UPON THE WINDOWS OF THE APARTMENT THE ACTION HOWEVER WAS BUT MOMENTARY HIS GAZE RETURNED MECHANICALLY TO THE WALL
8163-274549-0028 TO HIS EXTREME HORROR AND ASTONISHMENT THE HEAD OF THE GIGANTIC STEED HAD IN THE MEANTIME ALTERED ITS POSITION THE NECK OF THE ANIMAL BEFORE ARCHED AS IF IN COMPASSION OVER THE PROSTRATE BODY OF ITS LORD
8163-274549-0029 WAS NOW EXTENDED AT FULL LENGTH IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BARON THE EYES BEFORE INVISIBLE NOW WORE AN ENERGETIC AND HUMAN EXPRESSION WHILE THEY GLEAMED WITH A FIERY AND UNUSUAL RED
8163-274549-0030 AND THE DISTENDED LIPS OF THE APPARENTLY ENRAGED HORSE LEFT IN FULL VIEW HIS GIGANTIC AND DISGUSTING TEETH STUPIFIED WITH TERROR THE YOUNG NOBLEMAN TOTTERED TO THE DOOR
8163-274549-0031 ASSUMING THE EXACT POSITION AND PRECISELY FILLING UP THE CONTOUR OF THE RELENTLESS AND TRIUMPHANT MURDERER OF THE SARACEN BERLIFITZING TO LIGHTEN THE DEPRESSION OF HIS SPIRITS THE BARON HURRIED INTO THE OPEN AIR
8163-274549-0032 AT THE PRINCIPAL GATE OF THE PALACE HE ENCOUNTERED THREE EQUERRIES WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY AND AT THE IMMINENT PERIL OF THEIR LIVES THEY WERE RESTRAINING THE CONVULSIVE PLUNGES OF A GIGANTIC AND FIERY COLORED HORSE
8163-274549-0033 WHOSE HORSE WHERE DID YOU GET HIM DEMANDED THE YOUTH IN A QUERULOUS AND HUSKY TONE OF VOICE AS HE BECAME INSTANTLY AWARE THAT THE MYSTERIOUS STEED IN THE TAPESTRIED CHAMBER WAS THE VERY COUNTERPART OF THE FURIOUS ANIMAL BEFORE HIS EYES
8163-274549-0034 AT LEAST HE IS CLAIMED BY NO OTHER OWNER WE CAUGHT HIM FLYING ALL SMOKING AND FOAMING WITH RAGE FROM THE BURNING STABLES OF THE CASTLE BERLIFITZING
8163-274549-0035 SUPPOSING HIM TO HAVE BELONGED TO THE OLD COUNT'S STUD OF FOREIGN HORSES WE LED HIM BACK AS AN ESTRAY BUT THE GROOMS THERE DISCLAIM ANY TITLE TO THE CREATURE WHICH IS STRANGE SINCE HE BEARS EVIDENT MARKS OF HAVING MADE A NARROW ESCAPE FROM THE FLAMES
8163-274549-0036 YOU ARE MISTAKEN MY LORD THE HORSE AS I THINK WE MENTIONED IS NOT FROM THE STABLES OF THE COUNT IF SUCH HAD BEEN THE CASE WE KNOW OUR DUTY BETTER THAN TO BRING HIM INTO THE PRESENCE OF A NOBLE OF YOUR FAMILY TRUE OBSERVED THE BARON DRYLY
8163-274549-0037 AND AT THAT INSTANT A PAGE OF THE BEDCHAMBER CAME FROM THE PALACE WITH A HEIGHTENED COLOR AND A PRECIPITATE STEP HE WHISPERED INTO HIS MASTER'S EAR AN ACCOUNT OF THE SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE OF A SMALL PORTION OF THE TAPESTRY IN AN APARTMENT WHICH HE DESIGNATED
8163-274549-0038 ENTERING AT THE SAME TIME INTO PARTICULARS OF A MINUTE AND CIRCUMSTANTIAL CHARACTER BUT FROM THE LOW TONE OF VOICE IN WHICH THESE LATTER WERE COMMUNICATED NOTHING ESCAPED TO GRATIFY THE EXCITED CURIOSITY OF THE EQUERRIES THE YOUNG FREDERICK
8163-274549-0039 DURING THE CONFERENCE SEEMED AGITATED BY A VARIETY OF EMOTIONS HE SOON HOWEVER RECOVERED HIS COMPOSURE AND AN EXPRESSION OF DETERMINED MALIGNANCY SETTLED UPON HIS COUNTENANCE
8163-274549-0040 AS HE GAVE PEREMPTORY ORDERS THAT A CERTAIN CHAMBER SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY LOCKED UP AND THE KEY PLACED IN HIS OWN POSSESSION HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE UNHAPPY DEATH OF THE OLD HUNTER BERLIFITZING
8163-274549-0041 THE HUGE STEED WHICH THAT NOBLEMAN HAD ADOPTED AS HIS OWN PLUNGED AND CURVETTED WITH REDOUBLED FURY DOWN THE LONG AVENUE WHICH EXTENDED FROM THE CHATEAU TO THE STABLES OF METZENGERSTEIN NO SAID THE BARON TURNING ABRUPTLY TOWARD THE SPEAKER
8163-274549-0042 AND TO A NOBLE OF YOUR NAME WILL BE I IMAGINE NO UNWELCOME INTELLIGENCE A RAPID SMILE SHOT OVER THE COUNTENANCE OF THE LISTENER HOW DIED HE IN HIS RASH EXERTIONS TO RESCUE A FAVORITE PORTION OF HIS HUNTING STUD
8163-274549-0043 HE HAS HIMSELF PERISHED MISERABLY IN THE FLAMES
8163-274549-0044 OFFERED ANY THING CONGENIAL WITH THOSE OF THE NEIGHBORING ARISTOCRACY HE WAS NEVER TO BE SEEN BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS OWN DOMAIN AND IN THIS WIDE AND SOCIAL WORLD WAS UTTERLY COMPANIONLESS
8163-274549-0045 UNLESS INDEED THAT UNNATURAL IMPETUOUS AND FIERY COLORED HORSE WHICH HE HENCEFORWARD CONTINUALLY BESTRODE HAD ANY MYSTERIOUS RIGHT TO THE TITLE OF HIS FRIEND
8163-274549-0046 NUMEROUS INVITATIONS ON THE PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR A LONG TIME HOWEVER PERIODICALLY CAME IN WILL THE BARON HONOR OUR FESTIVALS WITH HIS PRESENCE WILL THE BARON JOIN US IN A HUNTING OF THE BOAR
8163-274549-0047 METZENGERSTEIN DOES NOT HUNT METZENGERSTEIN WILL NOT ATTEND WERE THE HAUGHTY AND LACONIC ANSWERS THESE REPEATED INSULTS WERE NOT TO BE ENDURED BY AN IMPERIOUS NOBILITY
8163-274549-0048 SUCH INVITATIONS BECAME LESS CORDIAL LESS FREQUENT IN TIME THEY CEASED ALTOGETHER THE WIDOW OF THE UNFORTUNATE COUNT BERLIFITZING WAS EVEN HEARD TO EXPRESS A HOPE
8163-274549-0049 THAT THE BARON MIGHT BE AT HOME WHEN HE DID NOT WISH TO BE AT HOME SINCE HE DISDAINED THE COMPANY OF HIS EQUALS AND RIDE WHEN HE DID NOT WISH TO RIDE SINCE HE PREFERRED THE SOCIETY OF A HORSE
8163-274549-0050 AND MERELY PROVED HOW SINGULARLY UNMEANING OUR SAYINGS ARE APT TO BECOME WHEN WE DESIRE TO BE UNUSUALLY ENERGETIC THE CHARITABLE NEVERTHELESS ATTRIBUTED THE ALTERATION IN THE CONDUCT OF THE YOUNG NOBLEMAN
8163-274549-0051 TO THE NATURAL SORROW OF A SON FOR THE UNTIMELY LOSS OF HIS PARENTS FORGETTING HOWEVER HIS ATROCIOUS AND RECKLESS BEHAVIOR DURING THE SHORT PERIOD IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDING THAT BEREAVEMENT
8163-274549-0052 SOME THERE WERE INDEED WHO SUGGESTED A TOO HAUGHTY IDEA OF SELF CONSEQUENCE AND DIGNITY OTHERS AGAIN AMONG THEM MAY BE MENTIONED THE FAMILY PHYSICIAN DID NOT HESITATE IN SPEAKING OF MORBID MELANCHOLY
8163-274549-0053 INDEED THE BARON'S PERVERSE ATTACHMENT TO HIS LATELY ACQUIRED CHARGER AN ATTACHMENT WHICH SEEMED TO ATTAIN NEW STRENGTH FROM EVERY FRESH EXAMPLE OF THE ANIMAL'S FEROCIOUS AND DEMON LIKE PROPENSITIES
8163-274549-0054 AT LENGTH BECAME IN THE EYES OF ALL REASONABLE MEN A HIDEOUS AND UNNATURAL FERVOR IN THE GLARE OF NOON AT THE DEAD HOUR OF NIGHT IN SICKNESS OR IN HEALTH IN CALM OR IN TEMPEST
8163-274549-0055 THERE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES MOREOVER WHICH COUPLED WITH LATE EVENTS GAVE AN UNEARTHLY AND PORTENTOUS CHARACTER TO THE MANIA OF THE RIDER AND TO THE CAPABILITIES OF THE STEED
8163-274549-0056 THE SPACE PASSED OVER IN A SINGLE LEAP HAD BEEN ACCURATELY MEASURED AND WAS FOUND TO EXCEED BY AN ASTOUNDING DIFFERENCE THE WILDEST EXPECTATIONS OF THE MOST IMAGINATIVE
8163-274549-0057 HIS STABLE TOO WAS APPOINTED AT A DISTANCE FROM THE REST AND WITH REGARD TO GROOMING AND OTHER NECESSARY OFFICES NONE BUT THE OWNER IN PERSON HAD VENTURED TO OFFICIATE OR EVEN TO ENTER THE ENCLOSURE OF THAT PARTICULAR STALL
8163-274549-0058 IT WAS ALSO TO BE OBSERVED THAT ALTHOUGH THE THREE GROOMS WHO HAD CAUGHT THE STEED AS HE FLED FROM THE CONFLAGRATION AT BERLIFITZING HAD SUCCEEDED IN ARRESTING HIS COURSE BY MEANS OF A CHAIN BRIDLE AND NOOSE
8163-274549-0059 YET NO ONE OF THE THREE COULD WITH ANY CERTAINTY AFFIRM THAT HE HAD DURING THAT DANGEROUS STRUGGLE OR AT ANY PERIOD THEREAFTER ACTUALLY PLACED HIS HAND UPON THE BODY OF THE BEAST
8163-274549-0060 INSTANCES OF PECULIAR INTELLIGENCE IN THE DEMEANOR OF A NOBLE AND HIGH SPIRITED HORSE ARE NOT TO BE SUPPOSED CAPABLE OF EXCITING UNREASONABLE ATTENTION ESPECIALLY AMONG MEN WHO
8163-274549-0061 BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH INTRUDED THEMSELVES PER FORCE UPON THE MOST SKEPTICAL AND PHLEGMATIC
8163-274549-0062 AND IT IS SAID THERE WERE TIMES WHEN THE ANIMAL CAUSED THE GAPING CROWD WHO STOOD AROUND TO RECOIL IN HORROR FROM THE DEEP AND IMPRESSIVE MEANING OF HIS TERRIBLE STAMP
8163-274549-0063 TIMES WHEN THE YOUNG METZENGERSTEIN TURNED PALE AND SHRUNK AWAY FROM THE RAPID AND SEARCHING EXPRESSION OF HIS EARNEST AND HUMAN LOOKING EYE
8163-274549-0064 AMONG ALL THE RETINUE OF THE BARON HOWEVER NONE WERE FOUND TO DOUBT THE ARDOR OF THAT EXTRAORDINARY AFFECTION WHICH EXISTED ON THE PART OF THE YOUNG NOBLEMAN FOR THE FIERY QUALITIES OF HIS HORSE
8163-274549-0065 AT LEAST NONE BUT AN INSIGNIFICANT AND MISSHAPEN LITTLE PAGE WHOSE DEFORMITIES WERE IN EVERYBODY'S WAY AND WHOSE OPINIONS WERE OF THE LEAST POSSIBLE IMPORTANCE HE IF HIS IDEAS ARE WORTH MENTIONING AT ALL HAD THE EFFRONTERY
8163-274549-0066 TO ASSERT THAT HIS MASTER NEVER VAULTED INTO THE SADDLE WITHOUT AN UNACCOUNTABLE AND ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE SHUDDER AND THAT UPON HIS RETURN FROM EVERY LONG CONTINUED AND HABITUAL RIDE AN EXPRESSION OF TRIUMPHANT MALIGNITY
8163-274549-0067 DISTORTED EVERY MUSCLE IN HIS COUNTENANCE ONE TEMPESTUOUS NIGHT METZENGERSTEIN AWAKING FROM A HEAVY SLUMBER DESCENDED LIKE A MANIAC FROM HIS CHAMBER AND MOUNTING IN HOT HASTE BOUNDED AWAY INTO THE MAZES OF THE FOREST
8163-274549-0068 AN OCCURRENCE SO COMMON ATTRACTED NO PARTICULAR ATTENTION BUT HIS RETURN WAS LOOKED FOR WITH INTENSE ANXIETY ON THE PART OF HIS DOMESTICS WHEN AFTER SOME HOURS ABSENCE THE STUPENDOUS AND MAGNIFICENT BATTLEMENTS OF THE CHATEAU METZENGERSTEIN
8163-274549-0069 WERE DISCOVERED CRACKLING AND ROCKING TO THEIR VERY FOUNDATION UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A DENSE AND LIVID MASS OF UNGOVERNABLE FIRE
8163-274549-0070 AS THE FLAMES WHEN FIRST SEEN HAD ALREADY MADE SO TERRIBLE A PROGRESS THAT ALL EFFORTS TO SAVE ANY PORTION OF THE BUILDING WERE EVIDENTLY FUTILE THE ASTONISHED NEIGHBORHOOD STOOD IDLY AROUND IN SILENT AND PATHETIC WONDER
8163-274549-0071 THAN THAT BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE MOST APPALLING SPECTACLES OF INANIMATE MATTER UP THE LONG AVENUE OF AGED OAKS WHICH LED FROM THE FOREST TO THE MAIN ENTRANCE OF THE CHATEAU METZENGERSTEIN A STEED
8163-274549-0072 WAS SEEN LEAPING WITH AN IMPETUOSITY WHICH OUTSTRIPPED THE VERY DEMON OF THE TEMPEST THE CAREER OF THE HORSEMAN WAS INDISPUTABLY ON HIS OWN PART UNCONTROLLABLE
8163-274549-0073 THE AGONY OF HIS COUNTENANCE THE CONVULSIVE STRUGGLE OF HIS FRAME GAVE EVIDENCE OF SUPERHUMAN EXERTION BUT NO SOUND SAVE A SOLITARY SHRIEK ESCAPED FROM HIS LACERATED LIPS WHICH WERE BITTEN THROUGH AND THROUGH IN THE INTENSITY OF TERROR
8163-274549-0074 ONE INSTANT AND THE CLATTERING OF HOOFS RESOUNDED SHARPLY AND SHRILLY ABOVE THE ROARING OF THE FLAMES AND THE SHRIEKING OF THE WINDS ANOTHER AND CLEARING AT A SINGLE PLUNGE THE GATE WAY AND THE MOAT
8163-274549-0075 THE STEED BOUNDED FAR UP THE TOTTERING STAIRCASES OF THE PALACE AND WITH ITS RIDER DISAPPEARED AMID THE WHIRLWIND OF CHAOTIC FIRE THE FURY OF THE TEMPEST IMMEDIATELY DIED AWAY
8163-274549-0076 AND A DEAD CALM SULLENLY SUCCEEDED A WHITE FLAME STILL ENVELOPED THE BUILDING LIKE A SHROUD AND STREAMING FAR AWAY INTO THE QUIET ATMOSPHERE SHOT FORTH A GLARE OF PRETERNATURAL LIGHT
8163-274549-0077 WHILE A CLOUD OF SMOKE SETTLED HEAVILY OVER THE BATTLEMENTS IN THE DISTINCT COLOSSAL FIGURE OF
