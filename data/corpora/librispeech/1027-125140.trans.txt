1027-125140-0000 CHAPTER TEN A SUCCESSOR SOME OF THE REVEREND FRANK MILVEY'S BRETHREN HAD FOUND THEMSELVES EXCEEDINGLY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THEIR MINDS BECAUSE THEY WERE REQUIRED TO BURY THE DEAD TOO HOPEFULLY
1027-125140-0001 BUT THE REVEREND FRANK INCLINING TO THE BELIEF THAT THEY WERE REQUIRED TO DO ONE OR TWO OTHER THINGS SAY OUT OF NINE AND THIRTY CALCULATED TO TROUBLE THEIR CONSCIENCES RATHER MORE IF THEY WOULD THINK AS MUCH ABOUT THEM
1027-125140-0002 HELD HIS PEACE INDEED THE REVEREND FRANK MILVEY WAS A FORBEARING MAN WHO NOTICED MANY SAD WARPS AND BLIGHTS IN THE VINEYARD WHEREIN HE WORKED AND DID NOT PROFESS THAT THEY MADE HIM SAVAGELY WISE
1027-125140-0003 HE ONLY LEARNED THAT THE MORE HE HIMSELF KNEW IN HIS LITTLE LIMITED HUMAN WAY THE BETTER HE COULD DISTANTLY IMAGINE WHAT OMNISCIENCE MIGHT KNOW
1027-125140-0004 WHEREFORE IF THE REVEREND FRANK HAD HAD TO READ THE WORDS THAT TROUBLED SOME OF HIS BRETHREN AND PROFITABLY TOUCHED INNUMERABLE HEARTS IN A WORSE CASE THAN JOHNNY'S HE WOULD HAVE DONE SO OUT OF THE PITY AND HUMILITY OF HIS SOUL
1027-125140-0005 READING THEM OVER JOHNNY HE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN SIX CHILDREN BUT NOT OF HIS POVERTY AND READ THEM WITH DIMMED EYES AND VERY SERIOUSLY DID HE AND HIS BRIGHT LITTLE WIFE WHO HAD BEEN LISTENING
1027-125140-0006 LOOK DOWN INTO THE SMALL GRAVE AND WALK HOME ARM IN ARM THERE WAS GRIEF IN THE ARISTOCRATIC HOUSE AND THERE WAS JOY IN THE BOWER MISTER WEGG ARGUED IF AN ORPHAN WERE WANTED
1027-125140-0007 WAS HE NOT AN ORPHAN HIMSELF AND COULD A BETTER BE DESIRED AND WHY GO BEATING ABOUT BRENTFORD BUSHES SEEKING ORPHANS FORSOOTH WHO HAD ESTABLISHED NO CLAIMS UPON YOU AND MADE NO SACRIFICES FOR YOU
1027-125140-0008 WHEN HERE WAS AN ORPHAN READY TO YOUR HAND WHO HAD GIVEN UP IN YOUR CAUSE MISS ELIZABETH MASTER GEORGE AUNT JANE AND UNCLE PARKER MISTER WEGG CHUCKLED CONSEQUENTLY WHEN HE HEARD THE TIDINGS
1027-125140-0009 ON THE GENUINE LEG REMAINING TO HIM JOHN ROKESMITH'S MANNER TOWARDS MISSUS BOFFIN AT THIS TIME WAS MORE THE MANNER OF A YOUNG MAN TOWARDS A MOTHER THAN THAT OF A SECRETARY TOWARDS HIS EMPLOYER'S WIFE
1027-125140-0010 IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN MARKED BY A SUBDUED AFFECTIONATE DEFERENCE THAT SEEMED TO HAVE SPRUNG UP ON THE VERY DAY OF HIS ENGAGEMENT WHATEVER WAS ODD IN HER DRESS OR HER WAYS HAD SEEMED TO HAVE NO ODDITY FOR HIM
1027-125140-0011 HE HAD SOMETIMES BORNE A QUIETLY AMUSED FACE IN HER COMPANY BUT STILL IT HAD SEEMED AS IF THE PLEASURE HER GENIAL TEMPER AND RADIANT NATURE YIELDED HIM COULD HAVE BEEN QUITE AS NATURALLY EXPRESSED IN A TEAR AS IN A SMILE
1027-125140-0012 THE COMPLETENESS OF HIS SYMPATHY WITH HER FANCY FOR HAVING A LITTLE JOHN HARMON TO PROTECT AND REAR HE HAD SHOWN IN EVERY ACT AND WORD AND NOW THAT THE KIND FANCY WAS DISAPPOINTED
1027-125140-0013 HE TREATED IT WITH A MANLY TENDERNESS AND RESPECT FOR WHICH SHE COULD HARDLY THANK HIM ENOUGH BUT I DO THANK YOU MISTER ROKESMITH SAID MISSUS BOFFIN AND I THANK YOU MOST KINDLY YOU LOVE CHILDREN
1027-125140-0014 I HOPE EVERYBODY DOES THEY OUGHT SAID MISSUS BOFFIN BUT WE DON'T ALL OF US DO WHAT WE OUGHT DO US JOHN ROKESMITH REPLIED SOME AMONG US SUPPLY THE SHORT COMINGS OF THE REST
1027-125140-0015 YOU HAVE LOVED CHILDREN WELL MISTER BOFFIN HAS TOLD ME NOT A BIT BETTER THAN HE HAS BUT THAT'S HIS WAY HE PUTS ALL THE GOOD UPON ME YOU SPEAK RATHER SADLY MISTER ROKESMITH DO I
1027-125140-0016 IT SOUNDS TO ME SO WERE YOU ONE OF MANY CHILDREN HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AN ONLY CHILD NO THERE WAS ANOTHER DEAD LONG AGO FATHER OR MOTHER ALIVE
1027-125140-0017 DEAD AND THE REST OF YOUR RELATIONS
1027-125140-0018 I NEVER HEARD OF ANY AT THIS POINT OF THE DIALOGUE BELLA CAME IN WITH A LIGHT STEP SHE PAUSED AT THE DOOR A MOMENT HESITATING WHETHER TO REMAIN OR RETIRE
1027-125140-0019 PERPLEXED BY FINDING THAT SHE WAS NOT OBSERVED NOW DON'T MIND AN OLD LADY'S TALK SAID MISSUS BOFFIN BUT TELL ME ARE YOU QUITE SURE MISTER ROKESMITH THAT YOU HAVE NEVER HAD A DISAPPOINTMENT IN LOVE
1027-125140-0020 QUITE SURE WHY DO YOU ASK ME WHY FOR THIS REASON SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A KIND OF KEPT DOWN MANNER WITH YOU WHICH IS NOT LIKE YOUR AGE YOU CAN'T BE THIRTY I AM NOT YET THIRTY
1027-125140-0021 DEEMING IT HIGH TIME TO MAKE HER PRESENCE KNOWN BELLA COUGHED HERE TO ATTRACT ATTENTION BEGGED PARDON AND SAID SHE WOULD GO FEARING THAT SHE INTERRUPTED SOME MATTER OF BUSINESS
1027-125140-0022 NO DON'T GO REJOINED MISSUS BOFFIN BECAUSE WE ARE COMING TO BUSINESS INSTEAD OF HAVING BEGUN IT AND YOU BELONG TO IT AS MUCH NOW MY DEAR BELLA AS I DO BUT I WANT MY NODDY TO CONSULT WITH US
1027-125140-0023 ROKESMITH DEPARTED ON THAT ERRAND AND PRESENTLY RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY MISTER BOFFIN AT HIS JOG TROT BELLA FELT A LITTLE VAGUE TREPIDATION AS TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS SAME CONSULTATION
1027-125140-0024 UNTIL MISSUS BOFFIN ANNOUNCED IT
1027-125140-0025 AND DRAWING HER ARM THROUGH BELLA'S AND NODDY YOU SIT HERE AND MISTER ROKESMITH YOU SIT THERE NOW YOU SEE WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THIS MISTER AND MISSUS MILVEY HAVE SENT ME THE KINDEST NOTE POSSIBLE
1027-125140-0026 WHICH MISTER ROKESMITH JUST NOW READ TO ME OUT ALOUD FOR I AIN'T GOOD AT HANDWRITINGS OFFERING TO FIND ME ANOTHER LITTLE CHILD TO NAME AND EDUCATE AND BRING UP WELL THIS HAS SET ME THINKING
1027-125140-0027 IT MAYN'T BE SO EASY TO START HER BUT ONCE STARTED SHE'S A INGEIN THIS HAS SET ME THINKING I SAY REPEATED MISSUS BOFFIN CORDIALLY BEAMING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HER HUSBAND'S COMPLIMENT
1027-125140-0028 AND I HAVE THOUGHT TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL THAT I HAVE GROWN TIMID OF REVIVING JOHN HARMON'S NAME IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE NAME AND I FANCY I SHOULD REPROACH MYSELF IF I GAVE IT
1027-125140-0029 TO ANOTHER DEAR CHILD AND IT PROVED AGAIN UNLUCKY NOW WHETHER SAID MISTER BOFFIN GRAVELY PROPOUNDING A CASE FOR HIS SECRETARY'S OPINION WHETHER ONE MIGHT CALL THAT A SUPERSTITION
1027-125140-0030 IT IS A MATTER OF FEELING WITH MISSUS BOFFIN SAID ROKESMITH GENTLY THE NAME HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNFORTUNATE IT HAS NOW THIS NEW UNFORTUNATE ASSOCIATION CONNECTED WITH IT THE NAME HAS DIED OUT WHY REVIVE IT
1027-125140-0031 MIGHT I ASK MISS WILFER WHAT SHE THINKS IT HAS NOT BEEN A FORTUNATE NAME FOR ME SAID BELLA COLOURING
1027-125140-0032 BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT IN MY THOUGHTS AS WE HAD GIVEN THE NAME TO THE POOR CHILD AND AS THE POOR CHILD TOOK SO LOVINGLY TO ME I THINK I SHOULD FEEL JEALOUS OF CALLING ANOTHER CHILD BY IT
1027-125140-0033 I THINK I SHOULD FEEL AS IF THE NAME HAD BECOME ENDEARED TO ME AND I HAD NO RIGHT TO USE IT SO AND THAT'S YOUR OPINION REMARKED MISTER BOFFIN OBSERVANT OF THE SECRETARY'S FACE AND AGAIN ADDRESSING HIM
1027-125140-0034 I SAY AGAIN IT IS A MATTER OF FEELING RETURNED THE SECRETARY
1027-125140-0035 AND PRETTY NOW GIVE US YOUR OPINION NODDY SAID MISSUS BOFFIN MY OPINION OLD LADY RETURNED THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN IS YOUR OPINION THEN SAID MISSUS BOFFIN
1027-125140-0036 WE AGREE NOT TO REVIVE JOHN HARMON'S NAME BUT TO LET IT REST IN THE GRAVE IT IS AS MISTER ROKESMITH SAYS A MATTER OF FEELING BUT LOR HOW MANY MATTERS ARE MATTERS OF FEELING
1027-125140-0037 WELL AND SO I COME TO THE SECOND THING I HAVE THOUGHT OF YOU MUST KNOW BELLA MY DEAR AND MISTER ROKESMITH THAT WHEN I FIRST NAMED TO MY HUSBAND MY THOUGHTS OF ADOPTING A LITTLE ORPHAN BOY IN REMEMBRANCE OF JOHN HARMON
1027-125140-0038 I FURTHER NAMED TO MY HUSBAND THAT IT WAS COMFORTING TO THINK THAT HOW THE POOR BOY WOULD BE BENEFITED BY JOHN'S OWN MONEY AND PROTECTED FROM JOHN'S OWN FORLORNNESS HEAR HEAR CRIED MISTER BOFFIN SO SHE DID
1027-125140-0039 ANCOAR NO NOT ANCOAR NODDY MY DEAR RETURNED MISSUS BOFFIN BECAUSE I AM GOING TO SAY SOMETHING ELSE I MEANT THAT I AM SURE AS MUCH AS I STILL MEAN IT
1027-125140-0040 BUT THIS LITTLE DEATH HAS MADE ME ASK MYSELF THE QUESTION SERIOUSLY WHETHER I WASN'T TOO BENT UPON PLEASING MYSELF ELSE WHY DID I SEEK OUT SO MUCH FOR A PRETTY CHILD AND A CHILD QUITE TO MY LIKING
1027-125140-0041 WANTING TO DO GOOD WHY NOT DO IT FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND PUT MY TASTES AND LIKINGS BY PERHAPS SAID BELLA AND PERHAPS SHE SAID IT WITH SOME LITTLE SENSITIVENESS ARISING
1027-125140-0042 OUT OF THOSE OLD CURIOUS RELATIONS OF HERS TOWARDS THE MURDERED MAN PERHAPS IN REVIVING THE NAME YOU WOULD NOT HAVE LIKED TO GIVE IT TO A LESS INTERESTING CHILD THAN THE ORIGINAL HE INTERESTED YOU VERY MUCH
1027-125140-0043 WELL MY DEAR RETURNED MISSUS BOFFIN GIVING HER A SQUEEZE IT'S KIND OF YOU TO FIND THAT REASON OUT AND I HOPE IT MAY HAVE BEEN SO AND INDEED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT I BELIEVE IT WAS SO BUT I AM AFRAID NOT TO THE WHOLE EXTENT
1027-125140-0044 HOWEVER THAT DON'T COME IN QUESTION NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE WITH THE NAME LAID IT UP AS A REMEMBRANCE SUGGESTED BELLA MUSINGLY MUCH BETTER SAID MY DEAR LAID IT UP AS A REMEMBRANCE WELL THEN I HAVE BEEN THINKING
1027-125140-0045 BUT A CREATURE TO BE HELPED FOR ITS OWN SAKE NOT PRETTY THEN SAID BELLA NO RETURNED MISSUS BOFFIN STOUTLY NOR PREPOSSESSING THEN SAID BELLA
1027-125140-0046 NO RETURNED MISSUS BOFFIN NOT NECESSARILY SO THAT'S AS IT MAY HAPPEN A WELL DISPOSED BOY COMES IN MY WAY WHO MAY BE EVEN A LITTLE WANTING IN SUCH ADVANTAGES FOR GETTING ON IN LIFE
1027-125140-0047 BUT IS HONEST AND INDUSTRIOUS AND REQUIRES A HELPING HAND AND DESERVES IT IF I AM VERY MUCH IN EARNEST AND QUITE DETERMINED TO BE UNSELFISH LET ME TAKE CARE OF HIM
1027-125140-0048 HERE THE FOOTMAN WHOSE FEELINGS HAD BEEN HURT ON THE FORMER OCCASION APPEARED AND CROSSING TO ROKESMITH APOLOGETICALLY ANNOUNCED THE OBJECTIONABLE SLOPPY THE FOUR MEMBERS OF COUNCIL LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND PAUSED

1027-125140-0051 SHINING AND WINKING AND GLEAMING AND TWINKLING OUT OF A HUNDRED OF THOSE EYES OF BRIGHT METAL AT THE DAZZLED SPECTATORS THE ARTISTIC TASTE OF SOME UNKNOWN HATTER
1027-125140-0052 HAD FURNISHED HIM WITH A HATBAND OF WHOLESALE CAPACITY WHICH WAS FLUTED BEHIND FROM THE CROWN OF HIS HAT TO THE BRIM AND TERMINATED IN A BLACK BUNCH FROM WHICH THE IMAGINATION SHRUNK DISCOMFITED AND THE REASON REVOLTED
1027-125140-0053 SOME SPECIAL POWERS WITH WHICH HIS LEGS WERE ENDOWED HAD ALREADY HITCHED UP HIS GLOSSY TROUSERS AT THE ANKLES AND BAGGED THEM AT THE KNEES
1027-125140-0054 WHILE SIMILAR GIFTS IN HIS ARMS HAD RAISED HIS COAT SLEEVES FROM HIS WRISTS AND ACCUMULATED THEM AT HIS ELBOWS THUS SET FORTH

1027-125140-0062 AT THE MERE THOUGHT OF MISSUS HIGDEN IN THIS INCONCEIVABLE AFFLICTION MISTER SLOPPY'S COUNTENANCE BECAME PALE AND MANIFESTED THE MOST DISTRESSFUL EMOTIONS YOU ARE AS RIGHT AS RIGHT CAN BE SLOPPY SAID MISSUS BOFFIN

1027-125140-0066 MISTER SLOPPY KISSED MISSUS BOFFIN'S HAND AND THEN DETACHING HIMSELF FROM THAT GOOD CREATURE THAT HE MIGHT HAVE ROOM ENOUGH FOR HIS FEELINGS THREW BACK HIS HEAD OPENED HIS MOUTH WIDE AND UTTERED A DISMAL HOWL
1027-125140-0067 IT WAS CREDITABLE TO HIS TENDERNESS OF HEART BUT SUGGESTED THAT HE MIGHT ON OCCASION GIVE SOME OFFENCE TO THE NEIGHBOURS
