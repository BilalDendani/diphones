2531-156718-0000 FOR A WHOLE MINUTE HE STOOD THERE NOT DARING TO LOOK UP THEN HE TOOK A DEEP BREATH CLENCHED HIS HANDS TIGHTLY AND LIFTED HIS HEAD THERE IT WAS AS DAD HAD DESCRIBED IT BUT INFINITELY MORE GRAND
2531-156718-0001 IT SWEPT UPWARD FROM THE VALLEY FLOOR BEAUTIFULLY SHAPED AND SOARING SO TALL THAT ITS MISTY BLUE PEAK COULD SURELY TALK FACE TO FACE WITH THE STARS TO DAVID WHO HAD NEVER SEEN A MOUNTAIN BEFORE
2531-156718-0002 THE SIGHT WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH TO BEAR HE FELT SO TIGHT AND SHIVERY INSIDE THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER HE WANTED TO LAUGH OR CRY OR BOTH AND THE REALLY WONDERFUL THING ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN WAS THE WAY IT LOOKED AT HIM
2531-156718-0003 UNTIL THE GREEN AND TAWNY FADED INTO HAZY HEIGHTS OF ROCK IT WAS WAITING FOR HIM COME AND CLIMB IT WHISPERED COME AND CLIMB BUT THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL TO DO FIRST THEY WERE GOING TO MOVE INTO THE NEW HOUSE
2531-156718-0004 EVERYTHING WAS IN CONFUSION DAD WAS PUSHING CHAIRS AND TABLES AROUND IN AN AIMLESS WAY MOTHER WAS SAYING THEY'LL ALL HAVE TO GO OUT AGAIN WE FORGOT TO PUT DOWN THE RUG FIRST
2531-156718-0005 AUNT AMY WAS MAKING SHORT DASHES BETWEEN THE KITCHEN AND THE DINING ROOM MUTTERING TO HERSELF AND BECKIE WAS ROARING IN HER CRIB BECAUSE IT WAS TIME FOR HER BOTTLE DAVID ASKED
2531-156718-0006 CAN I DO ANYTHING HOPING THAT THE ANSWER WOULD BE NO C'MERE AUNT AMY SAID GRABBING HIM BY THE ARM HELP ME LOOK FOR THAT IRONING BOARD WHEN THE IRONING BOARD WAS FINALLY LOCATED MOTHER HAD SOMETHING FOR HIM TO DO
2531-156718-0007 SOMEHOW IN ALL THE RUSH AND CONFUSION THE AFTERNOON HAD DISAPPEARED ALREADY THE EVENING SUN WAS THROWING SHADOWS ACROSS THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN
2531-156718-0008 IT WAS TOO LATE NOW HE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL MORNING BEFORE HE COULD CLIMB AS HE GAZED UP MISERABLY AT THE GLOWING SUMMIT HE THOUGHT HE SAW A TINY SPECK SOAR OUT FROM IT IN A BRIEF CIRCLE
2531-156718-0009 WAS IT A BIRD OF SOME SORT OR JUST ONE OF THOSE DOTS THAT SWIM BEFORE YOUR EYES WHEN YOU STARE TOO LONG AT THE SKY IT ALMOST SEEMED LIKE THE MOUNTAIN WAVING ITS HAND AS IF TO SAY THAT IT WAS QUITE ALL RIGHT FOR HIM TO WAIT UNTIL MORNING
2531-156718-0010 HE FELT BETTER THEN AND RETURNED MORE CHEERFULLY TO THE MOVING IT WAS LONG AFTER DARK BEFORE THE MOVING VAN DROVE AWAY BECKIE CROONED HAPPILY OVER HER BOTTLE AND THE REST OF THEM GATHERED IN THE KITCHEN FOR A LATE SUPPER OF SANDWICHES AND CANNED SOUP
2531-156718-0011 BUT DAVID COULD NOT EAT UNTIL HE HAD FOUND THE COURAGE TO ASK ONE QUESTION MAY I CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN TOMORROW AUNT AMY MUTTERED SOMETHING ABOUT LANDSLIDES WHICH WERE FIRMLY FIXED IN HER MIND AS THE FATE OF PEOPLE WHO CLIMBED MOUNTAINS
2531-156718-0012 BUT DAD SAID I DON'T SEE WHY NOT DO YOU AND LOOKED TO MOTHER FOR AGREEMENT MOTHER SAID WELL BE VERY CAREFUL IN A DOUBTFUL TONE AND THAT WAS THAT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU WILL FIND WHEN YOU CLIMB A MOUNTAIN
2531-156718-0013 THERE WERE TERRACES LEDGES KNOLLS RAVINES AND EMBANKMENTS ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE EXCITING PART OF IT WAS THAT EACH FEATURE CONCEALED THE ONES ABOVE IT
2531-156718-0014 AT THE TOP OF A RISE WOULD BE AN OUTCROPPING OF STRANGELY COLORED ROCK INVISIBLE FROM BELOW BEYOND THE OUTCROPPING A SMALL STAND OF ASPENS WOULD QUIVER IN THE BREEZE THEIR QUICKSILVER LEAVES HIDING A TINY MEADOW ON THE SLOPE BEHIND
2531-156718-0015 AND WHEN THE MEADOW HAD BEEN DISCOVERED THERE WOULD BE A SOMETHING ELSE BEYOND HE WAS A REAL EXPLORER NOW WHEN HE GOT TO THE TOP HE THOUGHT HE WOULD BUILD A LITTLE TOWER OF STONES THE WAY EXPLORERS ALWAYS DO
2531-156718-0016 AND THE DISTANCE HE HAD ALREADY COVERED WAS A CONSIDERABLE ONE HE LOOKED BACK THE TOWN LOOKED LIKE A MODEL OF A TOWN WITH LITTLE TOY HOUSES AND DIFFERENT COLORED ROOFS AMONG THE TREES THAT MADE A DARKER PATCH ON THE PATTERN OF THE VALLEY FLOOR
2531-156718-0017 THE MOUNTAINS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY SEEMED LIKE BLUE CLOUDS STRETCHING OUT OVER THE EDGE OF THE WORLD EVEN THE PEAK COULD NOT GIVE HIM A BETTER VIEW THAN THIS DAVID GAZED UP THE FACE OF A SCARP
2531-156718-0018 WHICH ROSE LIKE A CLIFF ABOVE HIM A SMOOTH BARE WALL OF ROCK THAT HAD HALTED HIS CLIMB HALFWAY UP THE SCARP WAS A DARK HORIZONTAL LINE OF BUSHES SOMETHING LIKE A HEDGE APPARENTLY THERE WAS A LEDGE OR SHELF THERE AND HE DECIDED TO CLIMB UP TO IT BEFORE HE RETURNED HOME
2531-156718-0019 TO SCALE THE ROCK FACE ITSELF WAS IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER THERE WERE NO HAND OR FOOT HOLDS SO HE TURNED AND MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE GRASS UNTIL HE REACHED THE END OF THE BARE STONE THEN HE STARTED UPWARD AGAIN IT WAS HARD WORK
2531-156718-0020 HE FELT LIKE SHOUTING WHEN AT LAST HE REACHED THE LEDGE TRULY IT WAS AN ENCHANTED PLACE IT WAS A LONG LEVEL STRIP OF GROUND SEVERAL YARDS WIDE CARPETED WITH SHORT GRASS AND DANDELIONS BUSHES GREW ALONG MOST OF THE OUTER EDGE
2531-156718-0021 THE INNER EDGE WAS BOUNDED BY A SECOND SCARP A WALL OF RED STONE WITH SPARKLING POINTS OF LIGHT IMBEDDED IN ITS SMOOTH SURFACE DAVID THREW HIMSELF ON THE GRASS AND ROLLED IN IT IT WAS WARM AND SOFT AND SWEET SMELLING
2531-156718-0022 IT SOOTHED AWAY THE HURT OF HIS ACHING MUSCLES AND THE STING OF HIS SCRATCHES HE ROLLED OVER ON HIS BACK AND CUSHIONED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS THE SKY SEEMED TO BE SLIPPING ALONG OVERHEAD LIKE A BROAD BLUE RIVER THE BREEZE RUFFLED HIS HAIR
2531-156718-0023 AND WHISPERED THE BUSHES MURMURED AND GOSSIPED TO EACH OTHER EVEN THE SUNLIGHT SEEMED TO HUM TO HIM AS IT LAID WARM HANDS ON HIS FACE BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER SOUND WHICH NOW AND THEN ROSE ABOVE THESE MURMURS
2531-156718-0024 THEN IT WOULD FADE AND BE DROWNED OUT BY THE BREEZE HARD TO SAY WHY BUT IT JUST DID NOT SEEM TO FIT THERE DAVID PROPPED HIMSELF UP ON HIS ELBOWS AND LISTENED MORE INTENTLY THE SOUND FADED HE HAD BEEN IMAGINING IT
2531-156718-0025 NO HE HAD NOT BEEN IMAGINING IT THERE IT WAS AGAIN HE SAT UP NOW HE NOTICED THAT THE LEDGE WAS DIVIDED BY A THICKET WHICH GREW FROM THE INNER SIDE TO THE OUTER THE NOISE WHATEVER IT WAS CAME FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE THICKET
2531-156718-0026 DAVID'S CURIOSITY WAS AROUSED BUT IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE WISE TO BE CAUTIOUS THE NOISE DID NOT SOUND DANGEROUS BUT WELL HE HAD NEVER BEEN UP A MOUNTAIN BEFORE AND THERE WAS NO TELLING WHAT HE MIGHT FIND
2531-156718-0027 HE DROPPED INTO A CROUCH AND CREPT SILENTLY UP TO THE TANGLE OF BUSHES HIS HEART BEGAN TO POUND AND HE SWALLOWED TO RELIEVE THE DRYNESS IN HIS THROAT THE NOISE WAS MUCH MORE DISTINCT NOW AND IT SOUNDED LIKE LIKE
2531-156718-0028 THE BRANCHES GREW VERY LOW AND THE GROUND WAS FULL OF LUMPS AND KNOBS WHICH DUG INTO HIM WITH EVERY MOVEMENT THERE WERE VINES TOO AND SOME PRICKLY THINGS LIKE THISTLES
2531-156718-0029 HE PROGRESSED BY INCHES PUSHING WITH HIS TOES PULLING WITH HIS FINGER TIPS WRIGGLING WITH THE REST OF HIS BODY
