5604-26987-0000 AND EVERY ONE KNEW THERE WAS A SECOND BONFIRE OF VANITIES BEING PREPARED IN FRONT OF THE OLD PALACE BUT AT THIS HOUR IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE CENTRE OF POPULAR INTEREST LAY ELSEWHERE
5604-26987-0001 FROM THE PRESSURE OF NEW COMERS TRYING TO FORCE THEIR WAY FORWARD FROM ALL THE OPENINGS BUT THE FRONT RANKS WERE ALREADY CLOSE SERRIED AND RESISTED THE PRESSURE THOSE RANKS WERE RANGED AROUND A SEMICIRCULAR BARRIER IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH
5604-26987-0002 AND WITHIN THIS BARRIER WERE ALREADY ASSEMBLING THE DOMINICAN BRETHREN OF SAN MARCO BUT THE TEMPORARY WOODEN PULPIT ERECTED OVER THE CHURCH DOOR WAS STILL EMPTY
5604-26987-0003 IT WAS PRESENTLY TO BE ENTERED BY THE MAN WHOM THE POPE'S COMMAND HAD BANISHED FROM THE PULPIT OF THE DUOMO WHOM THE OTHER ECCLESIASTICS OF FLORENCE HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN TO CONSORT WITH WHOM THE CITIZENS HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN TO HEAR ON PAIN OF EXCOMMUNICATION
5604-26987-0004 THIS MAN HAD SAID A WICKED UNBELIEVING POPE WHO HAS GAINED THE PONTIFICAL CHAIR BY BRIBERY IS NOT CHRIST'S VICAR HIS CURSES ARE BROKEN SWORDS HE GRASPS A HILT WITHOUT A BLADE
5604-26987-0005 THOUGH THE POPE WAS HANGING TERRIBLE THREATS OVER FLORENCE IF IT DID NOT RENOUNCE THE PESTILENTIAL SCHISMATIC AND SEND HIM TO ROME TO BE CONVERTED STILL AS ON THIS VERY MORNING ACCEPTED THE COMMUNION FROM HIS EXCOMMUNICATED HANDS
5604-26987-0006 IT WAS A MOMENTOUS QUESTION
5604-26987-0007 NAMELY WHAT WAS AND WHAT WAS NOT ACCORDANT WITH THE HIGHEST SPIRITUAL LAW
5604-26987-0008 HE WOULD ATTEST HIS CHOICE BY SOME UNMISTAKABLE SIGN AS LONG AS THE BELIEF IN THE PROPHET CARRIED NO THREAT OF OUTWARD CALAMITY BUT RATHER THE CONFIDENT HOPE OF EXCEPTIONAL SAFETY NO SIGN WAS NEEDED
5604-26987-0009 HIS PREACHING WAS A MUSIC TO WHICH THE PEOPLE FELT THEMSELVES MARCHING ALONG THE WAY THEY WISHED TO GO
5604-26987-0010 AND AN INTERDICT ON THEIR CITY THERE INEVITABLY CAME THE QUESTION WHAT MIRACLE SHOWEST THOU SLOWLY AT FIRST THEN FASTER AND FASTER THAT FATAL DEMAND HAD BEEN SWELLING IN SAVONAROLA'S EAR
5604-26987-0011 PROVOKING A RESPONSE OUTWARDLY IN THE DECLARATION THAT AT THE FITTING TIME THE MIRACLE WOULD COME INWARDLY IN THE FAITH NOT UNWAVERING FOR WHAT FAITH IS SO THAT IF THE NEED FOR MIRACLE BECAME URGENT
5604-26987-0012 THE WORK HE HAD BEFORE HIM WAS TOO GREAT FOR THE DIVINE POWER TO LEAVE IT HALTING HIS FAITH WAVERED BUT NOT HIS SPEECH IT IS THE LOT OF EVERY MAN WHO HAS TO SPEAK FOR THE SATISFACTION OF THE CROWD THAT HE MUST OFTEN SPEAK IN VIRTUE OF YESTERDAY'S FAITH
5604-26987-0013 HOPING IT WILL COME BACK TO MORROW IT WAS IN PREPARATION FOR A SCENE WHICH WAS REALLY A RESPONSE TO THE POPULAR IMPATIENCE FOR SOME SUPERNATURAL GUARANTEE OF THE PROPHET'S MISSION THAT THE WOODEN PULPIT HAD BEEN ERECTED ABOVE THE CHURCH DOOR
5604-26987-0014 BUT WHILE THE ORDINARY FRATI IN BLACK MANTLES WERE ENTERING AND ARRANGING THEMSELVES
5604-26987-0015 IT WAS FELT THAT SAVONAROLA WOULD NOT APPEAR JUST YET AND THERE WAS SOME INTEREST IN SINGLING OUT THE VARIOUS MONKS SOME OF THEM BELONGING TO HIGH FLORENTINE FAMILIES
5604-26987-0016 MANY OF THEM HAVING FATHERS BROTHERS OR COUSINS AMONG THE ARTISANS AND SHOPKEEPERS WHO MADE THE MAJORITY OF THE CROWD IT WAS NOT TILL THE TALE OF MONKS WAS COMPLETE NOT TILL THEY HAD FLUTTERED THEIR BOOKS AND HAD BEGUN TO CHANT THAT PEOPLE SAID TO EACH OTHER
5604-26987-0017 FRA GIROLAMO MUST BE COMING NOW THAT EXPECTATION RATHER THAN ANY SPELL FROM THE ACCUSTOMED WAIL OF PSALMODY WAS WHAT MADE SILENCE AND EXPECTATION SEEM TO SPREAD LIKE A PALING SOLEMN LIGHT OVER THE MULTITUDE OF UPTURNED FACES
5604-26987-0018 ALL NOW DIRECTED TOWARDS THE EMPTY PULPIT THE NEXT INSTANT THE PULPIT WAS NO LONGER EMPTY A FIGURE COVERED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN BLACK COWL AND MANTLE HAD ENTERED IT AND WAS KNEELING WITH BENT HEAD AND WITH FACE TURNED AWAY
5604-26987-0019 IT SEEMED A WEARY TIME TO THE EAGER PEOPLE WHILE THE BLACK FIGURE KNELT AND THE MONKS CHANTED
5604-26987-0020 SO THAT THOSE WHO HAD ALREADY THE WILL TO STONE HIM FELT THEIR ARMS UNNERVED AT LAST THERE WAS A VIBRATION AMONG THE MULTITUDE EACH SEEMING TO GIVE HIS NEIGHBOUR A MOMENTARY ASPEN LIKE TOUCH
5604-26987-0021 AS WHEN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN WATCHING FOR SOMETHING IN THE HEAVENS SEE THE EXPECTED PRESENCE SILENTLY DISCLOSING ITSELF
5604-26987-0022 AND TO THOSE WHO STOOD NEAR THE PULPIT IT WAS AS IF THE SOUNDS WHICH HAD JUST BEEN FILLING THEIR EARS HAD SUDDENLY MERGED THEMSELVES IN THE FORCE OF SAVONAROLA'S FLASHING GLANCE AS HE LOOKED ROUND HIM IN THE SILENCE THEN HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HANDS
5604-26987-0023 WHICH IN THEIR EXQUISITE DELICACY SEEMED TRANSFIGURED FROM AN ANIMAL ORGAN FOR GRASPING INTO VEHICLES OF SENSIBILITY TOO ACUTE TO NEED ANY GROSS CONTACT HANDS THAT CAME LIKE AN APPEALING SPEECH FROM THAT PART OF HIS SOUL WHICH WAS MASKED BY HIS STRONG PASSIONATE FACE
5604-26987-0024 WRITTEN ON NOW WITH DEEPER LINES ABOUT THE MOUTH AND BROW THAN ARE MADE BY FORTY FOUR YEARS OF ORDINARY LIFE AT THE FIRST STRETCHING OUT OF THE HANDS SOME OF THE CROWD IN THE FRONT RANKS FELL ON THEIR KNEES AND HERE AND THERE A DEVOUT DISCIPLE FARTHER OFF
5604-26987-0025 BUT THE GREAT MAJORITY STOOD FIRM SOME RESISTING THE IMPULSE TO KNEEL BEFORE THIS EXCOMMUNICATED MAN MIGHT NOT A GREAT JUDGMENT FALL UPON HIM EVEN IN THIS ACT OF BLESSING
5604-26987-0026 OTHERS JARRED WITH SCORN AND HATRED OF THE AMBITIOUS DECEIVER WHO WAS GETTING UP THIS NEW COMEDY BEFORE WHICH NEVERTHELESS THEY FELT THEMSELVES IMPOTENT AS BEFORE THE TRIUMPH OF A FASHION BUT THEN CAME THE VOICE
5604-26987-0027 CLEAR AND LOW AT FIRST UTTERING THE WORDS OF ABSOLUTION
5604-26987-0028 THAT WANTED TO STIFLE IT IT RANG LIKE A TRUMPET TO THE EXTREMITIES OF THE PIAZZA AND UNDER IT EVERY HEAD WAS BOWED
5604-26987-0029 AFTER THE UTTERANCE OF THAT BLESSING SAVONAROLA HIMSELF FELL ON HIS KNEES AND HID HIS FACE IN TEMPORARY EXHAUSTION THOSE GREAT JETS OF EMOTION WERE A NECESSARY PART OF HIS LIFE HE HIMSELF HAD SAID TO THE PEOPLE LONG AGO WITHOUT PREACHING I CANNOT LIVE
5604-26987-0030 BUT IT WAS A LIFE THAT SHATTERED HIM IN A FEW MINUTES MORE SOME HAD RISEN TO THEIR FEET BUT A LARGER NUMBER REMAINED KNEELING AND ALL FACES WERE INTENTLY WATCHING HIM
5604-26987-0031 WHEN I SHOULD HOLD THIS SACRAMENT IN MY HAND IN THE FACE OF YOU ALL TO PRAY FERVENTLY TO THE MOST HIGH THAT IF THIS WORK OF MINE DOES NOT COME FROM HIM HE WILL SEND A FIRE AND CONSUME ME
5604-26987-0032 IF SOME IN A SPIRIT OF DEVOUT OBEDIENCE MADE THE EFFORT TO PRAY EVERY CONSCIOUSNESS WAS CHIEFLY POSSESSED BY THE SENSE THAT SAVONAROLA WAS PRAYING IN A VOICE NOT LOUD BUT DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE IN THE WIDE STILLNESS LORD
5604-26987-0033 IF I HAVE NOT WROUGHT IN SINCERITY OF SOUL IF MY WORD COMETH NOT FROM THEE STRIKE ME IN THIS MOMENT WITH THY THUNDER AND LET THE FIRES OF THY WRATH ENCLOSE ME
5604-26987-0034 WITH EYES UPLIFTED AND A QUIVERING EXCITEMENT IN HIS WHOLE ASPECT EVERY ONE ELSE WAS MOTIONLESS AND SILENT TOO WHILE THE SUNLIGHT WHICH FOR THE LAST QUARTER OF AN HOUR HAD HERE AND THERE BEEN PIERCING THE GREYNESS MADE FITFUL STREAKS ACROSS THE CONVENT WALL
5604-26987-0035 CAUSING SOME AWE STRICKEN SPECTATORS TO START TIMIDLY BUT SOON THERE WAS A WIDER PARTING AND WITH A GENTLE QUICKNESS LIKE A SMILE A STREAM OF BRIGHTNESS POURED ITSELF ON THE CRYSTAL VASE AND THEN SPREAD ITSELF OVER SAVONAROLA'S FACE WITH MILD GLORIFICATION
5604-26987-0036 BEHOLD THE ANSWER THE WARM RADIANCE THRILLED THROUGH SAVONAROLA'S FRAME AND SO DID THE SHOUT IT WAS HIS LAST MOMENT OF UNTROUBLED TRIUMPH AND IN ITS RAPTUROUS CONFIDENCE HE FELT CARRIED TO A GRANDER SCENE YET TO COME
5604-26987-0037 BEFORE AN AUDIENCE THAT WOULD REPRESENT ALL CHRISTENDOM IN WHOSE PRESENCE HE SHOULD AGAIN BE SEALED AS THE MESSENGER OF THE SUPREME RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FEEL HIMSELF FULL CHARGED WITH DIVINE STRENGTH IT WAS BUT A MOMENT THAT EXPANDED ITSELF IN THAT PREVISION
5604-26987-0038 BUT WAS SPREADING ITSELF IMPARTIALLY OVER ALL THINGS CLEAN AND UNCLEAN THERE BEGAN ALONG WITH THE GENERAL MOVEMENT OF THE CROWD A CONFUSION OF VOICES IN WHICH CERTAIN STRONG DISCORDS AND VARYING SCALES OF LAUGHTER
5604-26987-0039 MADE IT EVIDENT THAT IN THE PREVIOUS SILENCE AND UNIVERSAL KNEELING HOSTILITY AND SCORN HAD ONLY SUBMITTED UNWILLINGLY TO A MOMENTARY SPELL
5604-26987-0040 IT SEEMS TO ME THE PLAUDITS ARE GIVING WAY TO CRITICISM SAID TITO WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING THE SCENE ATTENTIVELY FROM AN UPPER LOGGIA IN ONE OF THE HOUSES OPPOSITE THE CHURCH
