770-134592-0000 THE FARMHOUSE KITCHEN PROBABLY STOOD WHERE IT DID AS A MATTER OF ACCIDENT OR HAPHAZARD CHOICE YET ITS SITUATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLANNED BY A MASTER STRATEGIST IN FARMHOUSE ARCHITECTURE DAIRY AND POULTRY YARD AND HERB GARDEN
770-134592-0001 AND ALL THE BUSY PLACES OF THE FARM SEEMED TO LEAD BY EASY ACCESS INTO ITS WIDE FLAGGED HAVEN WHERE THERE WAS ROOM FOR EVERYTHING AND WHERE MUDDY BOOTS LEFT TRACES THAT WERE EASILY SWEPT AWAY
770-134592-0002 AND YET FOR ALL THAT IT STOOD SO WELL IN THE CENTRE OF HUMAN BUSTLE ITS LONG LATTICED WINDOW WITH THE WIDE WINDOW SEAT BUILT INTO AN EMBRASURE BEYOND THE HUGE FIREPLACE LOOKED OUT ON A WILD SPREADING VIEW OF HILL AND HEATHER AND WOODED COMBE
770-134592-0003 IMPRISONED WITHIN HIGH BLANK WALLS WAS NOT A ROOM THAT LENT ITSELF READILY EITHER TO COMFORT OR DECORATION WHEN WE ARE MORE SETTLED I SHALL WORK WONDERS IN THE WAY OF MAKING THE KITCHEN HABITABLE SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN TO HER OCCASIONAL VISITORS
770-134592-0004 THERE WAS AN UNSPOKEN WISH IN THOSE WORDS A WISH WHICH WAS UNCONFESSED AS WELL AS UNSPOKEN EMMA LADBRUK WAS THE MISTRESS OF THE FARM JOINTLY WITH HER HUSBAND SHE MIGHT HAVE HER SAY AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT HER WAY IN ORDERING ITS AFFAIRS
770-134592-0005 BUT SHE WAS NOT MISTRESS OF THE KITCHEN ON ONE OF THE SHELVES OF AN OLD DRESSER IN COMPANY WITH CHIPPED SAUCE BOATS PEWTER JUGS CHEESE GRATERS AND PAID BILLS RESTED A WORN AND RAGGED BIBLE
770-134592-0006 ON WHOSE FRONT PAGE WAS THE RECORD IN FADED INK OF A BAPTISM DATED NINETY FOUR YEARS AGO MARTHA CRALE WAS THE NAME WRITTEN ON THAT YELLOW PAGE THE YELLOW WRINKLED OLD DAME WHO HOBBLED AND MUTTERED ABOUT THE KITCHEN
770-134592-0007 LOOKING LIKE A DEAD AUTUMN LEAF WHICH THE WINTER WINDS STILL PUSHED HITHER AND THITHER HAD ONCE BEEN MARTHA CRALE FOR SEVENTY ODD YEARS SHE HAD BEEN MARTHA MOUNTJOY FOR LONGER THAN ANYONE COULD REMEMBER
770-134592-0008 SHE HAD PATTERED TO AND FRO BETWEEN OVEN AND WASH HOUSE AND DAIRY AND OUT TO CHICKEN RUN AND GARDEN GRUMBLING AND MUTTERING AND SCOLDING BUT WORKING UNCEASINGLY EMMA LADBRUK OF WHOSE COMING SHE TOOK AS LITTLE NOTICE AS SHE WOULD
770-134592-0009 OF A BEE WANDERING IN AT A WINDOW ON A SUMMERS DAY USED AT FIRST TO WATCH HER WITH A KIND OF FRIGHTENED CURIOSITY SHE WAS SO OLD AND SO MUCH A PART OF THE PLACE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO THINK OF HER EXACTLY AS A LIVING THING OLD SHEP
770-134592-0010 NOW HE WAS JUST A BLIND BREATHING CARCASE NOTHING MORE AND SHE STILL WORKED WITH FRAIL ENERGY STILL SWEPT AND BAKED AND WASHED FETCHED AND CARRIED IF THERE WERE SOMETHING IN THESE WISE OLD DOGS THAT DID NOT PERISH UTTERLY WITH DEATH
770-134592-0011 EMMA USED TO THINK TO HERSELF WHAT GENERATIONS OF GHOST DOGS THERE MUST BE OUT ON THOSE HILLS THAT MARTHA HAD REARED AND FED AND TENDED AND SPOKEN A LAST GOOD BYE WORD TO IN THAT OLD KITCHEN
770-134592-0012 AND WHAT MEMORIES SHE MUST HAVE OF HUMAN GENERATIONS THAT HAD PASSED AWAY IN HER TIME IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE LET ALONE A STRANGER LIKE EMMA TO GET HER TO TALK OF THE DAYS THAT HAD BEEN
770-134592-0013 THERE HAD BEEN A PALMERSTON THAT HAD BEEN A NAME DOWN TIVERTON WAY TIVERTON WAS NOT A FAR JOURNEY AS THE CROW FLIES BUT TO MARTHA IT WAS ALMOST A FOREIGN COUNTRY LATER THERE HAD BEEN NORTHCOTES AND ACLANDS AND MANY OTHER NEWER NAMES THAT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN
770-134592-0014 THE NAMES CHANGED BUT IT WAS ALWAYS LIBRULS AND TOORIES YELLOWS AND BLUES AND THEY ALWAYS QUARRELLED AND SHOUTED AS TO WHO WAS RIGHT AND WHO WAS WRONG THE ONE THEY QUARRELLED ABOUT MOST WAS A FINE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH AN ANGRY FACESHE
770-134592-0015 SHE HAD SEEN IT ON THE FLOOR TOO WITH A ROTTEN APPLE SQUASHED OVER IT FOR THE FARM HAD CHANGED ITS POLITICS FROM TIME TO TIME MARTHA HAD NEVER BEEN ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER NONE OF THEY HAD EVER DONE THE FARM A STROKE OF GOOD
770-134592-0016 SUCH WAS HER SWEEPING VERDICT GIVEN WITH ALL A PEASANTS DISTRUST OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD WHEN THE HALF FRIGHTENED CURIOSITY HAD SOMEWHAT FADED AWAY EMMA LADBRUK WAS UNCOMFORTABLY CONSCIOUS OF ANOTHER FEELING TOWARDS THE OLD WOMAN
770-134592-0017 EMMA HAD COME TO THE FARM FULL OF PLANS FOR LITTLE REFORMS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PART THE RESULT OF TRAINING IN THE NEWEST WAYS AND METHODS IN PART THE OUTCOME OF HER OWN IDEAS AND FANCIES REFORMS IN THE KITCHEN REGION
770-134592-0018 IF THOSE DEAF OLD EARS COULD HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO GIVE THEM EVEN A HEARING WOULD HAVE MET WITH SHORT SHRIFT AND SCORNFUL REJECTION AND THE KITCHEN REGION SPREAD OVER THE ZONE OF DAIRY AND MARKET BUSINESS AND HALF THE WORK OF THE HOUSEHOLD
770-134592-0019 EMMA WITH THE LATEST SCIENCE OF DEAD POULTRY DRESSING AT HER FINGER TIPS SAT BY AN UNHEEDED WATCHER WHILE OLD MARTHA TRUSSED THE CHICKENS FOR THE MARKET STALL AS SHE HAD TRUSSED THEM FOR NEARLY FOURSCORE YEARSALL
770-134592-0020 ABOVE ALL THE COVETED WINDOW CORNER THAT WAS TO BE A DAINTY CHEERFUL OASIS IN THE GAUNT OLD KITCHEN STOOD NOW CHOKED AND LUMBERED WITH A LITTER OF ODDS AND ENDS THAT EMMA FOR ALL HER NOMINAL AUTHORITY
770-134592-0021 EMMA WAS CONSCIOUS THAT THE WISH WAS THERE DISOWNED THOUGH IT MIGHT BE LURKING AT THE BACK OF HER MIND SHE FELT THE MEANNESS OF THE WISH COME OVER HER WITH A QUALM OF SELF REPROACH ONE DAY WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE KITCHEN
770-134592-0022 AND FOUND AN UNACCUSTOMED STATE OF THINGS IN THAT USUALLY BUSY QUARTER OLD MARTHA WAS NOT WORKING A BASKET OF CORN WAS ON THE FLOOR BY HER SIDE AND OUT IN THE YARD THE POULTRY WERE BEGINNING TO CLAMOUR A PROTEST OF OVERDUE FEEDING TIME
770-134592-0023 BUT MARTHA SAT HUDDLED IN A SHRUNKEN BUNCH ON THE WINDOW SEAT
770-134592-0024 HAD ONCE BEEN A MERRY NOISY CHILD PLAYING ABOUT IN LANES AND HAY LOFTS AND FARMHOUSE GARRETS THAT HAD BEEN EIGHTY ODD YEARS AGO AND NOW SHE WAS JUST A FRAIL OLD BODY COWERING UNDER THE APPROACHING CHILL OF THE DEATH THAT WAS COMING AT LAST TO TAKE HER
770-134592-0025 IT WAS NOT PROBABLE THAT MUCH COULD BE DONE FOR HER BUT EMMA HASTENED AWAY TO GET ASSISTANCE AND COUNSEL HER HUSBAND SHE KNEW WAS DOWN AT A TREE FELLING SOME LITTLE DISTANCE OFF BUT SHE MIGHT FIND SOME OTHER INTELLIGENT SOUL WHO KNEW THE OLD WOMAN BETTER THAN SHE DID
770-134592-0026 THE FARM SHE SOON FOUND OUT HAD THAT FACULTY COMMON TO FARMYARDS OF SWALLOWING UP AND LOSING ITS HUMAN POPULATION THE POULTRY FOLLOWED HER IN INTERESTED FASHION AND SWINE GRUNTED INTERROGATIONS AT HER FROM BEHIND THE BARS OF THEIR STYES
770-134592-0027 BUT BARNYARD AND RICKYARD ORCHARD AND STABLES AND DAIRY GAVE NO REWARD TO HER SEARCH THEN AS SHE RETRACED HER STEPS TOWARDS THE KITCHEN SHE CAME SUDDENLY ON HER COUSIN YOUNG MISTER JIM AS EVERY ONE CALLED HIM
770-134592-0028 WHO DIVIDED HIS TIME BETWEEN AMATEUR HORSE DEALING RABBIT SHOOTING AND FLIRTING WITH THE FARM MAIDS IM AFRAID OLD MARTHA IS DYING SAID EMMA JIM WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON TO WHOM ONE HAD TO BREAK NEWS GENTLY NONSENSE
770-134592-0029 HE SAID MARTHA MEANS TO LIVE TO A HUNDRED SHE TOLD ME SO AND SHELL DO IT SHE MAY BE ACTUALLY DYING AT THIS MOMENT OR IT MAY JUST BE THE BEGINNING OF THE BREAK UP PERSISTED EMMA WITH A FEELING OF CONTEMPT FOR THE SLOWNESS AND DULNESS OF THE YOUNG MAN
770-134592-0030 A GRIN SPREAD OVER HIS GOOD NATURED FEATURES IT DONT LOOK LIKE IT HE SAID NODDING TOWARDS THE YARD EMMA TURNED TO CATCH THE MEANING OF HIS REMARK OLD MARTHA STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF A MOB OF POULTRY
770-134592-0031 SCATTERING HANDFULS OF GRAIN AROUND HER THE TURKEY COCK WITH THE BRONZED SHEEN OF HIS FEATHERS AND THE PURPLE RED OF HIS WATTLES THE GAMECOCK WITH THE GLOWING METALLIC LUSTRE OF HIS EASTERN PLUMAGE THE HENS WITH THEIR OCHRES AND BUFFS AND UMBERS
770-134592-0032 AND THEIR SCARLET COMBS AND THE DRAKES WITH THEIR BOTTLE GREEN HEADS
770-134592-0033 IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED LIKE A WITHERED STALK STANDING AMID A RIOTOUS GROWTH OF GAILY HUED FLOWERS BUT SHE THREW THE GRAIN DEFTLY AMID THE WILDERNESS OF BEAKS
770-134592-0034 AND PASSED TO THE RABBIT SHOOTING COUSIN AS THE NEXT OF KIN EMMA LADBRUK DRIFTED OUT OF ITS HISTORY AS A BEE THAT HAD WANDERED IN AT AN OPEN WINDOW MIGHT FLIT ITS WAY OUT AGAIN ON A COLD GREY MORNING SHE STOOD WAITING
770-134592-0035 WITH HER BOXES ALREADY STOWED IN THE FARM CART TILL THE LAST OF THE MARKET PRODUCE SHOULD BE READY FOR THE TRAIN SHE WAS TO CATCH WAS OF LESS IMPORTANCE THAN THE CHICKENS AND BUTTER AND EGGS THAT WERE TO BE OFFERED FOR SALE FROM WHERE SHE STOOD
770-134592-0036 SHE COULD SEE AN ANGLE OF THE LONG LATTICED WINDOW THAT WAS TO HAVE BEEN COSY WITH CURTAINS AND GAY WITH BOWLS OF FLOWERS INTO HER MIND CAME THE THOUGHT THAT FOR MONTHS PERHAPS FOR YEARS LONG AFTER SHE HAD BEEN UTTERLY FORGOTTEN
770-134592-0037 A WHITE UNHEEDING FACE WOULD BE SEEN PEERING OUT THROUGH THOSE LATTICED PANES AND A WEAK MUTTERING VOICE WOULD BE HEARD QUAVERING UP AND DOWN THOSE FLAGGED PASSAGES SHE MADE HER WAY TO A NARROW BARRED CASEMENT THAT OPENED INTO THE FARM LARDER
