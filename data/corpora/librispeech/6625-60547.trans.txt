6625-60547-0000 I SHOULD COME TO OUR THIRD TALK WITH A GREAT CURIOSITY TO HEAR OF THE LAST PORTION OF THE RULE
6625-60547-0001 AND RULES THAT WOULD AIM AT ONCE AT HEALTH AND THAT CONSTANT EXERCISE OF WILL THAT MAKES LIFE GOOD SAVE IN SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE SAMURAI MUST BATHE IN COLD WATER AND THE MEN MUST SHAVE EVERY DAY
6625-60547-0002 THEY HAVE THE PRECISEST DIRECTIONS IN SUCH MATTERS THE BODY MUST BE IN HEALTH
6625-60547-0003 OR THE SAMURAI MUST GO TO THE DOCTORS OF THE ORDER AND GIVE IMPLICIT OBEDIENCE TO THE REGIMEN PRESCRIBED
6625-60547-0004 EVERY MONTH THEY MUST BUY AND READ FAITHFULLY THROUGH AT LEAST ONE BOOK THAT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND THE ONLY INTERVENTION WITH PRIVATE CHOICE IN THAT MATTER
6625-60547-0005 IS THE PRESCRIPTION OF A CERTAIN MINIMUM OF LENGTH FOR THE MONTHLY BOOK OR BOOKS BUT THE FULL RULE IN THESE MINOR COMPULSORY MATTERS
6625-60547-0006 AND IT ABOUNDS WITH ALTERNATIVES ITS AIM IS RATHER TO KEEP BEFORE THE SAMURAI BY A NUMBER OF SAMPLE DUTIES AS IT WERE THE NEED OF
6625-60547-0007 TOWARDS HEALTH OF BODY AND MIND RATHER THAN TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE RULE AND TO ENSURE THE MAINTENANCE OF A COMMUNITY OF FEELING AND INTERESTS AMONG THE SAMURAI THROUGH HABIT INTERCOURSE AND A LIVING CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE
6625-60547-0008 ALL SORTS OF PHYSICAL AND INTELLECTUAL SLUGGISHNESS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNSOCIAL PREOCCUPATIONS OF MANY SORTS WOMEN SAMURAI WHO ARE MARRIED MY DOUBLE TOLD ME
6625-60547-0009 MUST BEAR CHILDREN IF THEY ARE TO REMAIN MARRIED AS WELL AS IN THE ORDER BEFORE THE SECOND PERIOD FOR TERMINATING A CHILDLESS MARRIAGE IS EXHAUSTED
6625-60547-0010 BUT I THINK IT IS BEYOND DOUBT THAT IT IS FROM SAMURAI MOTHERS OF THE GREATER OR LESSER RULE THAT A VERY LARGE PROPORTION OF THE FUTURE POPULATION OF UTOPIA WILL BE DERIVED
6625-60547-0011 THERE IS ONE LIBERTY ACCORDED TO WOMEN SAMURAI WHICH IS REFUSED TO MEN AND THAT IS TO MARRY OUTSIDE THE RULE AND WOMEN MARRIED TO MEN NOT UNDER THE RULE ARE ALSO FREE TO BECOME SAMURAI
6625-60547-0012 FOR NOVELS AND THE DRAMA OF LIFE IN PRACTICE IT SEEMS THAT IT IS ONLY MEN OF GREAT POIETIC DISTINCTION OUTSIDE THE RULE OR GREAT COMMERCIAL LEADERS WHO HAVE WIVES UNDER IT THE TENDENCY OF SUCH UNIONS IS EITHER TO BRING THE HUSBAND UNDER THE RULE
6625-60547-0013 OR TAKE THE WIFE OUT OF IT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THESE MARRIAGE LIMITATIONS TEND TO MAKE THE SAMURAI SOMETHING OF AN HEREDITARY CLASS THEIR CHILDREN AS A RULE BECOME SAMURAI
6625-60547-0014 SUBJECT TO THE MOST REASONABLE QUALIFICATIONS ANYONE WHO SEES FIT CAN ENTER IT AT ANY TIME AND SO UNLIKE ALL OTHER PRIVILEGED CASTES THE WORLD HAS SEEN
6625-60547-0015 BUT NOW HE CAME TO THE HEART OF ALL HIS EXPLANATIONS TO THE WILL AND MOTIVES AT THE CENTRE THAT MADE MEN AND WOMEN READY TO UNDERGO DISCIPLINE
6625-60547-0016 TO MASTER EMOTIONS AND CONTROL IMPULSES TO KEEP IN THE KEY OF EFFORT WHILE THEY HAD ABUNDANCE ABOUT THEM TO ROUSE AND SATISFY ALL DESIRES AND HIS EXPOSITION WAS MORE DIFFICULT
6625-60547-0017 ON THE WHOLE IS GOOD THAT IS THEIR CARDINAL BELIEF MAN HAS PRIDE AND CONSCIENCE THEY HOLD
6625-60547-0018 HE HAS REMORSE AND SORROW IN HIS BEING COMING ON THE HEELS OF ALL INCONSEQUENT ENJOYMENTS HOW CAN ONE THINK OF HIM AS BAD HE IS RELIGIOUS RELIGION IS AS NATURAL TO HIM AS LUST AND ANGER
6625-60547-0019 AND IN UTOPIA THEY UNDERSTAND THIS OR AT LEAST THE SAMURAI DO CLEARLY THEY ACCEPT RELIGION AS THEY ACCEPT THIRST AS SOMETHING INSEPARABLY
6625-60547-0020 A FAILURE TO THINK HARD AND DISCRIMINATE AS FAIRLY AS POSSIBLE IN RELIGIOUS MATTERS IS JUST AS ALIEN TO THE MEN UNDER THE RULE AS IT WOULD BE TO DRINK DEEPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE THIRSTY
6625-60547-0021 EVADE A BATH BECAUSE THE DAY WAS CHILLY OR MAKE LOVE TO ANY BRIGHT EYED GIRL WHO CHANCED TO LOOK PRETTY IN THE DUSK UTOPIA WHICH IS TO HAVE EVERY TYPE OF CHARACTER THAT ONE FINDS ON EARTH WILL HAVE ITS TEMPLES AND ITS PRIESTS
6625-60547-0022 JUST AS IT WILL HAVE ITS ACTRESSES AND WINE BUT THE SAMURAI WILL BE FORBIDDEN THE RELIGION OF DRAMATICALLY LIT ALTARS ORGAN MUSIC AND INCENSE AS DISTINCTLY AS THEY ARE FORBIDDEN THE LOVE OF PAINTED WOMEN OR THE CONSOLATIONS OF BRANDY
6625-60547-0023 AND TO ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE LESS THAN RELIGION AND THAT SEEK TO COMPREHEND IT TO COSMOGONIES AND PHILOSOPHIES TO CREEDS AND FORMULAE TO CATECHISMS AND EASY EXPLANATIONS THE ATTITUDE OF THE SAMURAI THE NOTE OF THE BOOK OF SAMURAI
6625-60547-0024 WILL BE DISTRUST THESE THINGS THE SAMURAI WILL SAY ARE PART OF THE INDULGENCES THAT SHOULD COME BEFORE A MAN SUBMITS HIMSELF TO THE RULE THEY ARE LIKE THE EARLY GRATIFICATIONS OF YOUNG MEN EXPERIENCES TO ESTABLISH RENUNCIATION
6625-60547-0025 THEY WILL HOLD GOD TO BE COMPLEX AND OF AN ENDLESS VARIETY OF ASPECTS TO BE EXPRESSED BY NO UNIVERSAL FORMULA NOR APPROVED IN ANY UNIFORM MANNER
6625-60547-0026 OF EVERY MAN'S INDIVIDUALITY AND THE INTIMATE THING OF RELIGION MUST THEREFORE EXIST IN HUMAN SOLITUDE BETWEEN MAN AND GOD ALONE RELIGION IN ITS QUINTESSENCE IS A RELATION BETWEEN GOD AND MAN
6625-60547-0027 IT IS PERVERSION TO MAKE IT A RELATION BETWEEN MAN AND MAN AND A MAN MAY NO MORE REACH GOD THROUGH A PRIEST THAN LOVE HIS WIFE THROUGH A PRIEST BUT JUST AS A MAN IN LOVE MAY REFINE THE INTERPRETATION OF HIS FEELINGS AND BORROW EXPRESSION FROM THE POEMS AND MUSIC OF POIETIC MEN
6625-60547-0028 SO AN INDIVIDUAL MAN MAY AT HIS DISCRETION READ BOOKS OF DEVOTION
6625-60547-0029 WILL SET THEMSELVES PRIVATE REGIMENS THAT WILL HELP THEIR SECRET RELIGIOUS LIFE WILL PRAY HABITUALLY AND READ BOOKS OF DEVOTION BUT WITH THESE THINGS THE RULE OF THE ORDER WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO CLEARLY
6625-60547-0030 THE GOD OF THE SAMURAI IS A TRANSCENDENTAL AND MYSTICAL GOD SO FAR AS THE SAMURAI HAVE A PURPOSE IN COMMON IN MAINTAINING THE STATE AND THE ORDER AND PROGRESS OF THE WORLD SO FAR BY THEIR DISCIPLINE AND DENIAL BY THEIR PUBLIC WORK AND EFFORT THEY WORSHIP GOD TOGETHER
6625-60547-0031 FOR SEVEN CONSECUTIVE DAYS IN THE YEAR AT LEAST EACH MAN OR WOMAN UNDER THE RULE
6625-60547-0032 OF MAN INTO SOME WILD AND SOLITARY PLACE MUST SPEAK TO NO MAN OR WOMAN AND HAVE NO SORT OF INTERCOURSE WITH MANKIND THEY MUST GO BOOKLESS AND WEAPONLESS WITHOUT PEN OR PAPER OR MONEY PROVISIONS MUST BE TAKEN FOR THE PERIOD OF THE JOURNEY A RUG OR SLEEPING SACK
6625-60547-0033 FOR THEY MUST SLEEP UNDER THE OPEN SKY BUT NO MEANS OF MAKING A FIRE THEY MAY STUDY MAPS BEFOREHAND TO GUIDE THEM SHOWING ANY DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS IN THE JOURNEY BUT THEY MAY NOT CARRY SUCH HELPS THEY MUST NOT GO BY BEATEN WAYS OR WHEREVER THERE ARE INHABITED HOUSES
6625-60547-0034 BUT INTO THE BARE QUIET PLACES OF THE GLOBE THE REGIONS SET APART FOR THEM THIS DISCIPLINE MY DOUBLE SAID WAS INVENTED TO SECURE A CERTAIN STOUTNESS OF HEART AND BODY IN THE MEMBERS OF THE ORDER WHICH OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE LAIN OPEN TO TOO MANY TIMOROUS MERELY ABSTEMIOUS
6625-60547-0035 MEN AND WOMEN MANY THINGS HAD BEEN SUGGESTED SWORDPLAY AND TESTS THAT VERGED ON TORTURE CLIMBING IN GIDDY PLACES AND THE LIKE BEFORE THIS WAS CHOSEN PARTLY IT IS TO ENSURE GOOD TRAINING AND STURDINESS OF BODY AND MIND BUT PARTLY
6625-60547-0036 FROM THE INTRICATE ARGUMENTS AND THE FRETTING EFFORT TO WORK FROM PERSONAL QUARRELS AND PERSONAL AFFECTIONS AND THE THINGS OF THE HEATED ROOM
6625-60547-0037 CERTAIN GREAT AREAS ARE SET APART FOR THESE YEARLY PILGRIMAGES BEYOND THE SECURITIES OF THE STATE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF SQUARE MILES OF SANDY DESERT IN AFRICA AND ASIA SET APART MUCH OF THE ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC CIRCLES VAST AREAS OF MOUNTAIN LAND AND FROZEN MARSH
6625-60547-0038 UPON THE SEAS ONE MUST GO IN A LITTLE UNDECKED SAILING BOAT THAT MAY BE ROWED IN A CALM ALL THE OTHER JOURNEYS ONE MUST DO AFOOT NONE AIDING THERE ARE ABOUT ALL THESE
6625-60547-0039 IT IS GOOD I SAID IT IS GOOD MY DOUBLE ANSWERED WE CIVILISED MEN GO BACK TO THE STARK MOTHER THAT SO MANY OF US WOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN WERE IT NOT FOR THIS RULE AND ONE THINKS ONLY TWO WEEKS AGO I DID MY JOURNEY FOR THE YEAR I WENT WITH MY GEAR
