2374-160960-0000 THERE WAS ONCE A PRINCESS SO LOVELY THAT NO ONE COULD SEE HER WITHOUT LOVING HER HER HAIR FELL ABOUT HER SHOULDERS IN WAVING MASSES AND BECAUSE IT WAS THE COLOR OF GOLD SHE WAS CALLED PRETTY GOLDILOCKS
2374-160960-0001 SHE ALWAYS WORE A CROWN OF FLOWERS AND HER DRESSES WERE EMBROIDERED WITH PEARLS AND DIAMONDS THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY REACHED A YOUNG KING WHO DETERMINED TO MARRY HER ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER SEEN HER
2374-160960-0002 HE SENT AN AMBASSADOR TO ASK HER HAND IN MARRIAGE
2374-160960-0003 THAT HE MADE EVERY PREPARATION TO RECEIVE HER THE AMBASSADOR ARRIVED AT THE PALACE OF THE PRINCESS WITH A HUNDRED HORSES AND AS MANY SERVANTS WITH GREAT CEREMONY HE PRESENTED THE KING'S GIFTS OF PEARLS AND DIAMONDS TOGETHER WITH HIS MESSAGE
2374-160960-0004 THE PRINCESS HOWEVER DID NOT FAVOR THE KING'S SUIT AND SENT BACK HIS GIFTS WITH A POLITE REFUSAL WHEN THE AMBASSADOR RETURNED WITHOUT THE PRINCESS EVERY ONE BLAMED HIM FOR HIS FAILURE AND THE KING'S DISAPPOINTMENT WAS SO GREAT
2374-160960-0005 THAT NO ONE COULD CONSOLE HIM NOW AT THE KING'S COURT WAS A YOUNG MAN SO HANDSOME AND CLEVER THAT HE WAS CALLED CHARMING EVERY ONE LOVED HIM EXCEPT SOME WHO WERE ENVIOUS BECAUSE HE WAS THE KING'S FAVORITE
2374-160960-0006 ONE DAY CHARMING RASHLY REMARKED THAT IF THE KING HAD SENT HIM FOR THE PRINCESS SHE WOULD HAVE COME BACK WITH HIM HIS ENEMIES AT ONCE WENT TO THE KING AND USED THE REMARK TO INFLUENCE HIM AGAINST CHARMING
2374-160960-0007 HE THINKS HIMSELF SO HANDSOME THAT THE PRINCESS COULD NOT HAVE RESISTED HIM ALTHOUGH SHE REFUSED HIS KING THEY TOLD HIS MAJESTY THE BOASTFUL WORDS SO OFFENDED THE KING THAT HE ORDERED CHARMING TO BE SHUT UP IN THE TOWER
2374-160960-0008 WHERE HE HAD ONLY STRAW TO LIE ON AND BREAD AND WATER TO EAT IN THIS MISERABLE STATE HE LANGUISHED FOR SOME TIME
2374-160960-0009 ONE DAY THE KING HAPPENED TO BE PASSING THE TOWER AND HEARD HIM EXCLAIM I AM THE KING'S MOST FAITHFUL SUBJECT HOW HAVE I INCURRED HIS DISPLEASURE THEN IN SPITE OF THE PROTESTS OF CHARMING'S ENEMIES
2374-160960-0010 THE KING ORDERED THE TOWER DOOR OPENED AND CHARMING BROUGHT FORTH HIS OLD FAVORITE SADLY KNELT AND KISSED HIS HAND SAYING SIRE HOW HAVE I OFFENDED THE KING TOLD HIM OF THE BOAST HIS ENEMIES HAD REPEATED
2374-160960-0011 TRUE SIRE I DID SAY THAT HAD I BEEN SENT TO PLEAD YOUR CAUSE IT WOULD NOT HAVE FAILED FOR LACK OF ELOQUENCE COULD THE PRINCESS SEE YOU AS MY TONGUE WOULD PICTURE YOU I WOULD NOT RETURN WITHOUT HER
2374-160960-0012 THE KING AT ONCE SAW THAT HE HAD BEEN DECEIVED AND RESTORED CHARMING TO FAVOR WHILE AT SUPPER THAT NIGHT HE CONFIDED TO HIM THAT HE WAS AS MUCH IN LOVE WITH GOLDILOCKS AS EVER AND COULD NOT BE RECONCILED TO HER ANSWER
2374-160960-0013 DO YOU THINK ASKED THE KING THAT SHE COULD BE INDUCED TO CHANGE HER MIND CHARMING REPLIED THAT HE WAS AT THE KING'S SERVICE AND WILLING TO UNDERTAKE THE TASK OF WINNING THE PRINCESS FOR HIM
2374-160960-0014 THE KING WAS DELIGHTED AND OFFERED HIM A SPLENDID ESCORT BUT HE ASKED ONLY FOR A GOOD HORSE EARLY THE NEXT DAY HE SET FORTH WITH A RESOLUTE HEART AND THE KING'S LETTER TO THE PRINCESS ONE DAY
2374-160960-0015 WHEN HE HAD RIDDEN A GREAT DISTANCE HE DISMOUNTED AND SAT DOWN UNDER A TREE THAT GREW BESIDE A RIVER HE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET A LITTLE BOOK
2374-160960-0016 NOT FAR FROM WHERE HE SAT A GOLDEN CARP WAS SPRINGING FROM THE WATER TO CATCH FLIES AND A BOUND TOO HIGH LANDED IT ON THE GRASS AT CHARMING'S FEET IT PANTED HELPLESSLY AND WOULD HAVE DIED
2374-160960-0017 HAD HE NOT TAKEN PITY ON IT AND THROWN IT BACK INTO THE RIVER IT SANK OUT OF SIGHT BUT PRESENTLY RETURNED TO THE SURFACE LONG ENOUGH TO SAY THANK YOU CHARMING FOR SAVING MY LIFE SOME DAY I MAY REPAY YOU
2374-160960-0018 NATURALLY HE WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AT SO MUCH POLITENESS FROM A FISH A FEW DAYS LATER WHILE RIDING ALONG HIS WAY HE SAW A RAVEN PURSUED BY AN EAGLE IN A MOMENT MORE THE EAGLE WOULD HAVE OVERTAKEN THE RAVEN
2374-160960-0019 HAD NOT CHARMING AIMED HIS ARROW IN TIME AND KILLED THE PURSUER THE RAVEN PERCHED ON A TREE NEAR BY AND CROAKED ITS GRATITUDE YOU HAVE RESCUED ME FROM A DREADFUL FATE IT SAID
2374-160960-0020 A DAY OR TWO AFTERWARD IN THE DUSK OF EARLY MORNING HE HEARD THE DISTRESSFUL CRIES OF AN OWL HUNTING ABOUT HE FOUND THE UNFORTUNATE BIRD CAUGHT IN A NET WHICH SOME BIRDCATCHERS HAD SPREAD
2374-160960-0021 WHY WILL MEN PERSECUTE AND TORMENT HARMLESS CREATURES EXCLAIMED CHARMING AS HE SET THE BIRD FREE THE OWL FLUTTERED ABOVE HIS HEAD SAYING YOU HAVE SAVED ME FROM THE FOWLERS WHO WOULD HAVE KILLED ME
2374-160960-0022 AND SOME DAY I WILL REPAY YOU AFTER THAT IT FLEW SWIFTLY AWAY CHARMING AT LAST REACHED THE PALACE OF THE PRINCESS AND ASKED AN AUDIENCE HIS NAME SO PLEASED HER THAT SHE AT ONCE RECEIVED HIM
2374-160960-0023 HE WAS USHERED INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE PRINCESS WHO SAT ON A THRONE OF GOLD AND IVORY HER SATIN DRESS WAS EMBROIDERED WITH JEWELS AND HER GOLDEN HAIR WAS CONFINED BY A CROWN OF FLOWERS SOFT MUSIC AND PERFUME FILLED THE AIR
2374-160960-0024 AND CHARMING WAS SO AWED BY ALL THIS SPLENDOR THAT AT FIRST HE COULD NOT SPEAK RECOVERING HIMSELF IN A MOMENT HE TOLD OF HIS MISSION AND SET FORTH THE GOOD QUALITIES OF THE KING IN SUCH GLOWING TERMS THAT THE PRINCESS LISTENED
2374-160960-0025 YOU HAVE ARGUED SO ELOQUENTLY REPLIED SHE THAT I REGRET TO DENY YOU BUT I HAVE MADE A VOW NOT TO MARRY UNTIL THE AMBASSADOR CAN RETURN TO ME A RING WHICH I LOST IN THE RIVER A MONTH AGO
2374-160960-0026 I VALUED IT MORE THAN ALL MY OTHER JEWELS AND NOTHING BUT ITS RECOVERY CAN PERSUADE ME TO YOUR SUIT CHARMING COULD URGE NO MORE BUT OFFERED AN EMBROIDERED SCARF AND HIS LITTLE DOG FRISK AS TOKENS OF DEVOTION
2374-160960-0027 THESE WERE DECLINED SO BOWING LOW HE RELUCTANTLY TOOK LEAVE OF THE PRINCESS HE BELIEVED THAT SHE HAD BUT USED THIS MEANS TO PUT HIM OFF AND HIS DISAPPOINTMENT WAS SO GREAT THAT HE COULD NOT SLEEP
2374-160960-0028 IN THE MORNING HE AND FRISK WERE WALKING BY THE RIVERSIDE WHEN THE DOG RAN TO THE WATER'S EDGE BARKING FURIOUSLY JOINING THE LITTLE ANIMAL HE SAW THAT HIS EXCITEMENT WAS CAUSED BY A GOLDEN CARP
2374-160960-0029 WHICH CAME SWIMMING SWIFTLY TOWARD THEM IN ITS MOUTH WAS A BEAUTIFUL RING WHICH IT LAID IN CHARMING'S HAND YOU SAVED MY LIFE BY THE WILLOW TREE SAID THE CARP AND I NOW REPAY YOU BY GIVING TO YOU THE PRINCESS'S RING
2374-160960-0030 CHARMING LOST NO TIME IN PRESENTING IT TO THE PRINCESS AND CLAIMING HIS REWARD WHAT FAIRY AIDS YOU ASKED THE PRINCESS ONLY MY WISH TO SERVE YOU CHARMING REPLIED ALAS SAID THE PRINCESS
2374-160960-0031 I CANNOT MARRY UNTIL GALIFRON THE GIANT IS DEAD BECAUSE I WOULD NOT TAKE HIM FOR MY HUSBAND HE PERSECUTES MY SUBJECTS AND LAYS WASTE MY LAND PRINCESS
2374-160960-0032 THE PRINCESS AND ALL THE PEOPLE TRIED TO DISSUADE HIM
2374-160960-0033 HE TRAVELED STRAIGHT TO THE GIANT'S CASTLE ALL ABOUT IT WERE STREWN THE BONES OF GALIFRON'S VICTIMS INSIDE THE CASTLE THE GIANT WAS SINGING IN A TERRIBLE VOICE
2374-160960-0034 LITTLE CHILDREN I LOVE TO EAT THEIR BONES ARE TENDER THEIR FLESH IS SWEET I DO NOT CARE I EAT SO MANY IF THEIR HAIR BE STRAIGHT OR IF THEY HAVEN'T ANY CHARMING CALLED OUT LOUDLY IN REPLY
2374-160960-0035 BE NOT SO BOASTFUL GALIFRON
2374-160960-0036 THE GIANT APPEARED AT THE DOOR CLUB IN HAND WHEN HE SAW CHARMING FEARLESSLY AWAITING HIM
2374-160960-0037 BUT BEFORE HE COULD WIELD HIS CLUB A RAVEN LIT ON HIS HEAD AND PECKED AT HIS EYES SO THAT HE DROPPED HIS WEAPON AND WAS AT CHARMING'S MERCY WHEN THE VALIANT KNIGHT HAD KILLED THE GIANT THE RAVEN CROAKED FROM A TREE NEAR BY
2374-160960-0038 YOU SAVED ME FROM THE EAGLE
2374-160960-0039 CHARMING CUT OFF THE HEAD OF THE GIANT AND CARRIED IT BACK WITH HIM TO THE PRINCESS THEN THE PEOPLE SHOUTED UNTIL THEY WERE HOARSE AND WELCOMED HIM AS A GREAT HERO YOUR ENEMY IS DEAD
2374-160960-0040 CHARMING TOLD THE PRINCESS WILL YOU NOW MAKE MY MASTER THE HAPPIEST OF KINGS THERE IS REPLIED THE RELUCTANT PRINCESS SOME WATER WHICH GIVES ETERNAL HEALTH AND BEAUTY TO THOSE WHO DRINK IT
2374-160960-0041 I WOULD REGRET TO LEAVE MY KINGDOM WITHOUT POSSESSING SOME OF IT BUT NO ONE HAS DARED TO BRAVE THE TWO DRAGONS THAT GUARD THE CAVERN WHERE THE FOUNTAIN IS TO BE FOUND YOU DO NOT NEED THE WATER PRINCESS BUT MY LIFE IS YOURS TO COMMAND
2374-160960-0042 GALLANTLY REPLIED CHARMING AND HE SET OUT AT ONCE ON THE PERILOUS MISSION WHEN HE CAME TO THE MOUTH OF THE CAVERN BLACK SMOKE ISSUED FORTH AND PRESENTLY HE PERCEIVED THE TERRIBLE FORM OF A DRAGON
2374-160960-0043 FROM WHOSE MOUTH AND EYES FIRE WAS DARTING BIDDING GOOD BY TO FAITHFUL FRISK HE GRASPED HIS SWORD IN ONE HAND AND THE CRYSTAL FLASK WHICH THE PRINCESS HAD GIVEN HIM IN THE OTHER JUST THEN HE HEARD HIS NAME CALLED TWICE
2374-160960-0044 AND LOOKING BACK HE SAW AN OWL FLYING TOWARD HIM I CAN ENTER THE GLOOMY CAVERN WITHOUT DANGER THE OWL SAID GIVE THE FLASK TO ME AND I WILL REPAY THE DEBT I OWE YOU FOR HAVING SAVED ME FROM THE NET
2374-160960-0045 CHARMING GLADLY SURRENDERED THE FLASK TO THE OWL WHO IN A SHORT TIME RETURNED IT TO HIM FILLED WITH THE PRECIOUS WATER THE PRINCESS THIS TIME CONSENTED TO MARRY THE KING
2374-160960-0046 AND AFTER MANY PREPARATIONS SHE AND CHARMING STARTED FOR HIS KINGDOM THE JOURNEY WAS MADE SO ENTERTAINING FOR THE PRINCESS THAT SHE ONE DAY SAID TO CHARMING WHY DID I NOT MAKE YOU KING AND REMAIN IN MY OWN COUNTRY
2374-160960-0047 CHARMING REPLIED THAT HE MUST HAVE CONSIDERED HIS DUTY TO HIS KING EVEN BEFORE A HAPPINESS SO GREAT THE KING WITH PRESENTS OF RICH JEWELS AND A SPLENDID ESCORT MET THEM ON THE WAY TO THE PALACE
2374-160960-0048 THE MARRIAGE WAS CELEBRATED WITH GREAT POMP AND CHARMING STOOD FIRST IN THE KING'S FAVOR HIS GOOD FORTUNE HOWEVER DID NOT CONTINUE LONG FOR ENVIOUS ENEMIES POINTED OUT TO THE KING THAT THE PRINCESS WAS NEVER HAPPY UNLESS CHARMING WAS NEAR
2374-160960-0049 THE UNHAPPY KNIGHT WAS AGAIN PUT INTO PRISON WHERE HE WAS CRUELLY CHAINED AND FED ON BREAD AND WATER WHEN GOLDILOCKS LEARNED THIS SHE WEPT AND IMPLORED THE KING TO SET HIM FREE
2374-160960-0050 BUT FOR HIM I NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE SHE SAID DID HE NOT PERFORM EVERY TASK I REQUIRED EVEN THAT OF GETTING FOR ME THE WATER WHEREBY I SHALL NEVER GROW OLD THE PRINCESS'S GRIEF
2374-160960-0051 ONLY MADE THE KING MORE JEALOUS BUT HE DETERMINED TO MAKE USE OF THIS WONDERFUL WATER OF WHICH SHE HAD TOLD IT SO HAPPENED THAT ONE OF THE PRINCESS'S LADIES HAD BROKEN THE CRYSTAL FLASK AND SPILLED ALL OF THE WATER
2374-160960-0052 NOT DARING TO CONFESS SHE PUT ANOTHER IN ITS PLACE THAT EXACTLY RESEMBLED IT IN APPEARANCE THIS HOWEVER CONTAINED A DEADLY POISON WHEN THE KING BATHED HIS FACE WITH IT HE FELL INTO A SLEEP FROM WHICH HE NEVER AWOKE
2374-160960-0053 THERE WAS GREAT CONFUSION IN THE PALACE WHEN THE KING WAS FOUND DEAD FRISK RAN IMMEDIATELY TO CHARMING AND TOLD HIM THE NEWS IN A SHORT TIME GOLDILOCKS ALSO APPEARED UNLOCKED HIS CHAINS AND SET HIM FREE
2374-160960-0054 YOU SHALL BE MY HUSBAND SAID SHE AND I WILL MAKE YOU KING CHARMING FELL AT HER FEET AND EXPRESSED HIS GRATITUDE AND JOY
