8321-284207-0000 HE SAW AT ONCE THAT SHE HAD BEEN CRYING
8321-284207-0001 IN A LISTLESS VOICE SHE SAID AT ONCE FATHER
8321-284207-0002 BUT OH HOW I WANT TO GO TO NEWPORT WITH MERRY AND THE REST BUT OF COURSE IT WOULD COST THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THERE IS NO MONEY THE FATHER HAD STARTED EAGERLY TOWARD HIS DAUGHTER WHEN SHE HAD ENTERED
8321-284207-0003 BUT UPON HEARING THE CONCLUDING PART OF HER SPEECH HE DREW BACK A HURT EXPRESSION IN HIS CLEAR GRAY EYES HE FOLDED HIS ARMS AND A MORE ALERT OBSERVER THAN JANE WOULD HAVE NOTICED AN ALMOST HARD TONE IN HIS VOICE
8321-284207-0004 NEVER BEFORE HAD IT BEEN USED FOR THE DAUGHTER WHO WAS SO LIKE THE MOTHER IN LOOKS ONLY THE MATTER IS DECIDED JANE HE INFORMED HER THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT YOU REQUIRE WILL BE FORTHCOMING HOWEVER I WISH YOU WOULD PLAN TO LEAVE TOMORROW

8321-284207-0006 IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO COVER THEIR INVESTMENTS THE MAN SAID STILL COLDLY FOR HE BELIEVED THE GIRL WAS CRYING BECAUSE SHE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP EVEN MORE THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED AND BE KEPT IN POVERTY FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME SHE SAT UP HOWEVER WHEN HER FATHER SAID JANE DRY YOUR TEARS
8321-284207-0007 AND WHEN SHE RETURNED HER GRANDMOTHER AND JULIE WERE IN THEIR PLACES HER FATHER HAD REMAINED STANDING UNTIL SHE ALSO WAS SEATED THEN BOWING HIS HEAD HE SAID THE SIMPLE GRACE OF GRATITUDE WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN OMITTED AT THAT TABLE
8321-284207-0008 JANE MARVELED AT THE COURAGE OF HER FATHER FOR HE WAS ACTUALLY SMILING AT THE LITTLE OLD LADY WHO SAT AT HIS SIDE
8321-284207-0009 HAVE I BEEN GOOD TODAY THERE WERE SUDDEN TEARS IN THE FADING BLUE EYES AND A QUIVER IN THE CORNERS OF THE SWEET OLD MOUTH AS THE GRANDMOTHER REPLIED YES DAN YOU HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD

8321-284207-0011 THAN TO BE PRAISED FOR SMARTNESS AND THAT'S HOW TIS DANNY AND I'M HAPPY AND PROUD THE DEAR LITTLE OLD LADY WIPED HER EYES WITH A CORNER OF HER APRON THEN SHE SMILED UP BRIGHTLY AND PRETENDED TO EAT THE MEAT PIE WHICH WAS IN DANGER OF BEING NEGLECTED
8321-284207-0012 BY ALL EXCEPT JULIE WHO PRATTLED WE'VE SET AWAY TWO BIG PIECES ONE FOR BROTHER DAN WHEN HE COMES HOME FROM THE CITY AND ONE FOR GERRY
8321-284207-0013 WON'T THEY BE GLAD WHEN THEY SEE THEM THEY'LL BE HUNGRY AS ANYTHING I LIKE TO BE AWFUL HUNGRY WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING EXTRA SPECIAL TO EAT DON'T YOU JANEY ALMOST TIMOROUSLY THIS QUERY WAS VENTURED JULIE DID NOT LIKE TO HAVE THE BIG SISTER LOOK SO SAD THE ANSWER WAS NOT ENCOURAGING
8321-284207-0014 NOR EAT NEITHER IT LOOKS LIKE THE OLD LADY HAD JUST SAID WHEN THE FRONT DOOR BELL PEALED JULIE LEAPED UP LOOKING EAGERLY AT HER FATHER OH DAD MAY I GO BUT BEING NEAREST THE DOOR HE HAD RISEN I'LL ANSWER IT JULIE HE REPLIED
8321-284207-0015 BUT MISTER ABBOTT WAS MISTAKEN A MESSENGER BOY STOOD ON THE PORCH
8321-284207-0016 EAGERLY THE GIRL TORE IT OPEN THE OTHERS WATCHING HER WITH VARIED EMOTIONS ALTHOUGH JULIE'S WAS JUST EAGER CURIOSITY OHEE SHE SQUEALED

8321-284207-0020 MORE THAN EVER IS LIVING UP TO HER NICKNAME MERRY M S DURING THE READING OF THE NIGHT LETTER MISTER ABBOTT HAD QUICKLY MADE UP HIS MIND JUST WHAT HIS ATTITUDE WOULD BE THAT'S SPLENDID JANE ISN'T IT
8321-284207-0021 HE SAID AND NOT EVEN HIS WATCHFUL MOTHER NOTED A TRACE OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS VOICE IF I WERE YOU I WOULD PACK AT ONCE YOU WOULD BETTER GO OVER TO THE CITY IN THE MORNING AND THAT WILL GIVE YOU TIME TO BUY A NEW SUMMER DRESS FOR I AM SURE THAT YOU MUST NEED ONE
8321-284207-0022 AND SO SHE LEFT THE ROOM HURRIEDLY WITHOUT HAVING MORE THAN TOUCHED HER PLATE JULIE FOLLOWED AS SHE ADORED PACKING WHEN THEY WERE GONE THE MAN SIGHED DEEPLY MOTHER HE SAID I HAVE DECIDED TO SEND JULIE WITH DAN SHE CAN COOK THE SIMPLE THINGS HE WILL NEED AND SOME ONE MUST GO WITH THE BOY
8321-284207-0023 THE OLD LADY REACHED OUT A COMFORTING HAND AND PLACED IT ON THAT OF HER SON NEAREST HER DAN SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE JANE DOESN'T KNOW A THING ABOUT YOUR LONG ILLNESS DOES SHE NOBODY'S TOLD HER HAS THERE THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD
8321-284207-0024 BUT DON'T TELL HER MOTHER SHE DOES NOT SEEM TO CARE AND MOREOVER I AM NOW MUCH STRONGER MY ONLY REAL WORRY IS DAN AND I DO FEEL CONFIDENT THAT IF HE CAN BE WELL CARED FOR THE MOUNTAIN AIR WILL RESTORE HIS HEALTH
8321-284207-0025 RISING HE STOOPED TO KISS HIS MOTHER'S FOREHEAD THEN LEFT THE ROOM GOING THROUGH THE KITCHEN TO THE GARDEN
8321-284207-0026 HE SAW THE TWO GIRLS HURRYING ABOUT
8321-284207-0027 THIS ASSURANCE WAS BROUGHT TO HIM WHEN HE HEARD JANE SINGING A SNATCH OF A SCHOOL SONG IT SOUNDED LIKE A REQUIEM TO THE MAN IN THE GARDEN BELOW HE LEANED ON HIS HOE AS HE THOUGHT SELF REBUKINGLY
8321-284207-0028 I HAVE DONE AS MUCH FOR THE OTHER THREE CHILDREN BUT SOMEHOW THEY DIDN'T SPOIL THE COMFORT OF THAT REALIZATION WAS SO GREAT THAT THE FATHER SOON RETURNED TO HIS SELF IMPOSED TASK AND AN HOUR LATER WHEN DAN APPEARED HE TOLD THE BOY JANE'S DECISION SAYING
8321-284207-0029 SON OF MINE IT WOULD BE NO COMFORT TO YOU TO HAVE HER COMPANIONSHIP IF HER HEART WERE ELSEWHERE THE SHADOW OF KEEN DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE LAD'S EYES WAS QUICKLY DISPELLED PLACING A HAND ON HIS FATHER'S SHOULDER HE SAID CHEERFULLY IT'S ALL RIGHT DAD JULIE IS A GREAT LITTLE PAL
8321-284207-0030 BUT EVEN YET THE MATTER WAS NOT DECIDED THAT THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THE YOUNGER MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD WERE ASLEEP MISTER ABBOTT AND HIS MOTHER TALKED TOGETHER IN HIS DEN
8321-284207-0031 THE OLD LADY SMILED AS SHE RECALLED THE HOPPINGS AND SQUEALINGS WITH WHICH THE SMALL GIRL HAD EXPRESSED HER JOY LUCKILY I'D WASHED AND IRONED HER SUMMER CLOTHES ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY AND THIS BEING ONLY THURSDAY SHE HADN'T SOILED ANY OF THEM
8321-284207-0032 THEN HER TONE CHANGED TO ONE OF TENDERNESS DAN SHE SAID JULIE AND JANE AREN'T MUCH ALIKE ARE THEY THAT LITTLE GIRL DIDN'T HOP AND SQUEAL LONG BEFORE SHE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING THAT SOBERED HER THEN SHE TOLD ME I DON'T LIKE TO GO GRANDMA
8321-284207-0033 AND LEAVE GERALD AT HOME HE'S BEEN WISHING AND WISHING AND WISHING HE COULD GO BUT HE WOULDN'T TELL DAD CAUSE HE WANTS TO STAY HOME AND EARN MONEY TO HELP TO THE LITTLE OLD LADY'S SURPRISE HER COMPANION SPRANG UP AS HE EXCLAIMED MOTHER I WON'T BE GONE LONG WAIT UP FOR ME
8321-284207-0034 SEIZING HIS HAT FROM THE HALL TREE HE LEFT THE HOUSE WELL NOW THAT'S CERTAINLY A CURIOUS CAPER THE OLD LADY THOUGHT
8321-284207-0035 HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING HE'D FORGOTTEN PROBABLY IT'S SOMETHING FOR JANE WELL THERE'S NOTHING FOR ME TO DO BUT WAIT SHE GLANCED AT THE CLOCK ON THE MANTLE EVEN THEN IT WAS LATE SHE WAS USUALLY ASLEEP AT TEN THERE HAD BEEN TIME FOR MANY A LITTLE CAT NAP BEFORE SHE HEARD HER SON RETURNING
8321-284207-0036 HIS EXPRESSION ASSURED THE OLD LADY THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF HIS ERRAND WHY DAN ABBOTT SHE EXCLAIMED WHATEVER STARTED YOU OFF IN THAT WAY TWASN'T ANYTHING I SAID WAS IT THE MAN SANK DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN AND TOOK FROM HIS POCKET A TELEGRAM
8321-284207-0037 AND THIS IS HIS ANSWER GLAD INDEED TO ACCOMMODATE YOU DAN AND I'M SENDING ONE MORE JUST FOR GOOD MEASURE HAPPENED TO RECALL THAT YOU HAVE FOUR CHILDREN LET ME DO SOMETHING ELSE FOR YOU OLD MAN IF I CAN THE GRANDMOTHER LOOKED UP WITH SHINING EYES AS SHE COMMENTED

8321-284207-0039 THEN SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED AT HER SON INQUIRINGLY WILL IT BE QUITE FAIR TO MISTER PETERSON TO HAVE GERRY LEAVE HIS STORE WITHOUT GIVING NOTICE I'VE ATTENDED TO THAT MOTHER THE MAN REPLIED
8321-284207-0040 HE WANTS GERALD TO COME OVER THERE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING TO GET A PRESENT TO TAKE WITH HIM HE DIDN'T SAY WHAT IT WOULD BE
8321-284207-0041 I WAS INDEED HAPPY TO HAVE HIM PRAISE GERALD AS HE DID
8321-284207-0042 HE HAS WATCHED GERALD AS HE ALWAYS DOES EVERY LAD WHO WORKS IN THE STORE HE SAID THAT NEARLY ALL OF THEM HAD HELPED THEMSELVES TO A PIECE OF CANDY FROM THE SHOWCASE WHEN THEY HAD WISHED

8321-284207-0044 GERALD HADN'T EVEN THOUGHT OF HELPING HIMSELF AS HE WORKED AROUND THE STORE OF COURSE GERRY WOULDN'T THE OLD LADY REPLIED EMPHATICALLY FOR ISN'T HE YOUR SON DANIEL AND YOUR GRANDSON MOTHER THE MAN SMILINGLY RETURNED BUT WE MUST GET SOME SLEEP HE ADDED
