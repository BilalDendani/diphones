6248-298838-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE DRY SHERRY PRATT WASTED NO TIME IN CURSING MISSUS MURGATROYD THERE WOULD BE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCH RELIEF TO HIS FEELINGS LATER ON JUST THEN HE HAD OTHER MATTERS TO OCCUPY HIM FULLY
6248-298838-0001 HE TORE THE INDIGNANT LETTER TO SHREDS HE HASTILY THRUST THE BANK NOTES INTO ONE POCKET AND DREW HIS KEYS FROM ANOTHER WITHIN FIVE MINUTES HE HAD TAKEN FROM HIS SAFE A SEALED PACKET WHICH HE PLACED IN AN INSIDE POCKET OF HIS COAT AND HAD LEFT HIS OFFICE
6248-298838-0002 FOR THE LAST TIME AS HE KNEW VERY WELL THAT PART OF THE GAME WAS UP AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO BE SMART IN ENTERING ON ANOTHER PHASE OF IT SINCE ELDRICK'S VISIT OF THE PREVIOUS DAY PRATT HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR ALL EVENTUALITY
6248-298838-0003 HE HAD MADE READY FOR FLIGHT AND HE WAS NOT GOING EMPTY HANDED HE HAD A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MISSUS MALLATHORPE'S MONEY IN HIS POSSESSION BY OBTAINING HER SIGNATURE TO ONE OR TWO DOCUMENTS HE COULD EASILY OBTAIN MUCH MORE IN LONDON AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE
6248-298838-0004 THOSE DOCUMENTS WERE ALL READY AND IN THE SEALED PACKET WHICH HE HAD JUST TAKEN FROM THE SAFE IN IT TOO WERE SOME OTHER DOCUMENTS JOHN MALLATHORPE'S WILL THE LETTER WHICH MISSUS MALLATHORPE HAD WRITTEN TO HIM ON THE EVENING PREVIOUS TO HER SON'S FATAL ACCIDENT
6248-298838-0005 AND THE POWER OF ATTORNEY WHICH PRATT HAD OBTAINED FROM HER AT HIS FIRST INTERVIEW AFTER THAT OCCURRENCE ALL WAS READY AND NOW THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT TO GET TO NORMANDALE GRANGE SEE MISSUS MALLATHORPE AND VANISH
6248-298838-0006 HE HAD PLANNED IT ALL OUT CAREFULLY WHEN HE PERCEIVED THE FIRST DANGER SIGNALS AND KNEW THAT HIS OTHER PLANS AND SCHEMES WERE DOOMED TO FAILURE HALF AN HOUR AT NORMANDALE GRANGE A JOURNEY TO LONDON
6248-298838-0007 AND THEN THE NEXT TRAIN TO THE CONTINENT ON HIS WAY TO REGIONS MUCH FURTHER OFF HERE THINGS HAD TURNED OUT BADLY UNEXPECTEDLY BADLY BUT HE WOULD CARRY AWAY CONSIDERABLE EASILY TRANSPORTED WEALTH TO A NEW CAREER IN A NEW COUNTRY
6248-298838-0008 PRATT BEGAN HIS FLIGHT IN METHODICAL FASHION HE LOCKED UP HIS OFFICE AND LEFT THE BUILDING BY A BACK ENTRANCE WHICH TOOK HIM INTO A NETWORK OF COURTS AND ALLEYS AT THE REAR OF THE BUSINESS PART OF BARFORD
6248-298838-0009 HE MADE HIS WAY IN AND OUT OF THESE PLACES UNTIL HE REACHED A BICYCLE DEALER'S SHOP IN AN OBSCURE STREET WHEREAT HE HAD LEFT A MACHINE OF HIS OWN ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING UNDER THE EXCUSE OF HAVING IT THOROUGHLY CLEANED AND OILED IT WAS ALL READY FOR HIM ON HIS ARRIVAL
6248-298838-0010 AND HE PRESENTLY MOUNTED IT AND RODE AWAY THROUGH THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN CAREFULLY CHOOSING THE LESS FREQUENTED STREETS AND ROADS HE RODE ON UNTIL HE WAS CLEAR OF BARFORD UNTIL IN FACT HE WAS SOME MILES FROM IT
6248-298838-0011 AND HAD REACHED A VILLAGE WHICH WAS CERTAINLY NOT ON THE WAY TO NORMANDALE AND THEN AT THE POST OFFICE HE DISMOUNTED AND GOING INSIDE WROTE OUT AND DISPATCHED A TELEGRAM IT WAS A BRIEF MESSAGE CONTAINING BUT THREE WORDS ONE AS USUAL
6248-298838-0012 AND IT WAS ADDRESSED ESTHER MAWSON THE GRANGE NORMANDALE THIS DONE HE REMOUNTED HIS BICYCLE RODE OUT OF THE VILLAGE
6248-298838-0013 IN QUITE A DIFFERENT DIRECTION IT WAS NOT YET TEN O'CLOCK HE HAD THREE HOURS TO SPARE BEFORE THE TIME CAME FOR KEEPING THE APPOINTMENT WHICH HE HAD JUST MADE AT AN EARLY STAGE OF HIS OPERATIONS PRATT HAD FOUND THAT EVEN THE CLEVEREST OF SCHEMERS CANNOT WORK UNAIDED
6248-298838-0014 IT HAD BEEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO HAVE SOME TOOL CLOSE AT HAND TO NORMANDALE GRANGE AND ITS INHABITANTS TO HAVE SOME PERSON THERE UPON WHOM HE COULD DEPEND FOR NEWS HE HAD FOUND THAT PERSON THAT TOOL IN ESTHER MAWSON
6248-298838-0015 WHO AS MISSUS MALLATHORPE'S MAID HAD OPPORTUNITIES WHICH HE AT ONCE RECOGNIZED AS BEING LIKELY TO BE OF THE GREATEST VALUE TO HIM THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HARPER MALLATHORPE'S DEATH HAD THROWN PRATT AND THE MAID TOGETHER AND HE HAD QUICKLY DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS TO BE BOUGHT
6248-298838-0016 AND WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR MONEY HE HAD SOON COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HER SOON BARGAINED WITH HER AND MADE HER A WILLING ACCOMPLICE IN CERTAIN OF HIS SCHEMES WITHOUT LETTING HER KNOW THEIR FULL MEANING AND EXTENT ALL INDEED THAT SHE HAD LEARNED FROM PRATT
6248-298838-0017 WAS THAT HE HAD SOME CONSIDERABLE HOLD ON HER MISTRESS BUT IT IS DANGEROUS WORK TO PLAY WITH EDGED TOOLS AND IF PRATT HAD ONLY KNOWN IT HE WAS RUNNING GREAT RISKS IN USING ESTHER MAWSON AS A SEMI ACCOMPLICE ESTHER MAWSON WAS IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH HER MISTRESS
6248-298838-0018 AND MISSUS MALLATHORPE AFRAID OF HER DAUGHTER AND NOT GREATLY IN SYMPATHY WITH HER BADLY NEEDED A CONFIDANTE LITTLE BY LITTLE THE MISTRESS BEGAN TO CONFIDE IN THE MAID AND BEFORE LONG ESTHER MAWSON KNEW THE SECRET AND THENCEFORWARD SHE PLAYED A DOUBLE GAME
6248-298838-0019 PRATT FOUND HER USEFUL IN ARRANGING MEETINGS WITH MISSUS MALLATHORPE UNKNOWN TO NESTA AND HE BELIEVED HER TO BE DEVOTED TO HIM BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT ESTHER MAWSON HAD ONLY ONE OBJECT OF DEVOTION HERSELF
6248-298838-0020 AND SHE WAS WAITING AND WATCHING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO BENEFIT THAT OBJECT AT PRATT'S EXPENSE PRATT KNEW NOTHING OF THIS AS HE SLOWLY MADE HIS WAY TO NORMANDALE THAT MORNING HAVING PLENTY OF TIME HE WENT BY DEVIOUS AND LONELY ROADS AND BY LANES
6248-298838-0021 EVENTUALLY HE CAME TO THE BOUNDARY OF NORMANDALE PARK AT A POINT FAR AWAY FROM THE GRANGE THERE HE DISMOUNTED HID HIS BICYCLE IN A COPPICE WHEREIN HE HAD OFTEN LEFT IT BEFORE AND WENT ON TOWARDS THE HOUSE THROUGH THE WOODS AND PLANTATIONS
6248-298838-0022 HE KNEW EVERY YARD OF THE GROUND HE TRAVERSED AND WAS SKILLED IN TAKING COVER IF HE SAW ANY SIGN OF WOODMAN OR GAMEKEEPER AND IN THE END JUST AS ONE O'CLOCK CHIMED FROM THE CLOCK OVER THE STABLES HE CAME TO A QUIET SPOT IN THE SHRUBBERIES BEHIND THE GRANGE AND FOUND ESTHER MAWSON
6248-298838-0023 AND SIMILAR OCCASIONS ESTHER MAWSON IMMEDIATELY REALIZED THAT SOMETHING UNUSUAL WAS IN THE AIR CLEVER AS PRATT WAS AT CONCEALING HIS FEELINGS SHE WAS CLEVERER IN SEEING SMALL SIGNS AND SHE SAW THAT THIS WAS NO ORDINARY VISIT ANYTHING WRONG
6248-298838-0024 SHE ASKED AT ONCE BIT OF BOTHER NOTHING MUCH IT'LL BLOW OVER ANSWERED PRATT WHO KNEW THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CANDOUR WAS NECESSARY IN DEALING WITH THIS WOMAN BUT I SHALL HAVE TO BE AWAY FOR A BIT
6248-298838-0025 YOU WANT TO SEE HER INQUIRED ESTHER OF COURSE I'VE SOME PAPERS FOR HER TO SIGN REPLIED PRATT HOW DO THINGS STAND COAST CLEAR MISS MALLATHORPE'S GOING INTO BARFORD AFTER LUNCH ANSWERED ESTHER
6248-298838-0026 SHE'LL BE DRIVING IN ABOUT HALF PAST TWO I CAN MANAGE IT THEN HOW LONG SHALL YOU WANT TO BE WITH
6248-298838-0027 TEN MINUTES IF IT COMES TO THAT AND AFTER THAT ASKED ESTHER THEN I WANT TO GET A TRAIN AT SCALEBY REPLIED PRATT MENTIONING A RAILWAY JUNCTION WHICH LAY TEN MILES ACROSS COUNTRY IN ANOTHER DIRECTION SO MAKE IT AS SOON AFTER TWO THIRTY AS YOU CAN
6248-298838-0028 YOU CAN SEE HER AS SOON AS MISS MALLATHORPE'S GONE SAID ESTHER YOU'D BETTER COME INTO THE HOUSE I'VE GOT THE KEY OF THE TURRET DOOR AND ALL'S CLEAR THE SERVANTS ARE ALL AT DINNER I COULD DO WITH SOMETHING MYSELF OBSERVED PRATT WHO IN HIS ANXIETY
6248-298838-0029 ESTHER MAWSON LED THE WAY ALONG THIS UNTIL SHE AND PRATT CAME TO A TURRET IN THE GREY WALLS IN THE LOWER STORY OF WHICH A MASSIVE OAKEN DOOR HEAVILY CLAMPED WITH IRON GAVE ENTRANCE TO A WINDING STAIR LOCKED IT FROM INSIDE WHEN SHE AND PRATT HAD ENTERED
6248-298838-0030 AND PRECEDED HER COMPANION UP THE STAIR AND ACROSS ONE OR TWO EMPTY AND DUST COVERED CHAMBERS TO A SMALL ROOM IN WHICH A FEW PIECES OF ANCIENT FURNITURE WERE SLOWLY DROPPING TO DECAY PRATT HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN THIS ROOM BEFORE AND HE SAT DOWN IN ONE OF THE OLD CHAIRS
6248-298838-0031 AND MOPPED HIS FOREHEAD I WANT SOMETHING TO DRINK ABOVE EVERYTHING HE REMARKED WHAT CAN YOU GET NOTHING BUT WINE ANSWERED ESTHER MAWSON AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE OF THAT BECAUSE I'VE A STOCK THAT'S KEPT UP IN MISSUS MALLATHORPE'S ROOM
6248-298838-0032 I COULDN'T GET ANY ALE WITHOUT GOING TO THE BUTLER I CAN GET WINE AND SANDWICHES WITHOUT ANYBODY KNOWING THAT'LL DO SAID PRATT WHAT SORT OF WINE PORT SHERRY CLARET SHE REPLIED WHICHEVER YOU LIKE SHERRY THEN ANSWERED PRATT
6248-298838-0033 BRING A BOTTLE IF YOU CAN GET IT I WANT A GOOD DRINK THE WOMAN WENT AWAY THROUGH THE DISUSED PART OF THE OLD HOUSE INTO THE MODERN PORTION SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO A CERTAIN STORE CLOSET AND TOOK FROM IT A BOTTLE OF OLD DRY SHERRY WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT THERE FROM A BIN IN THE CELLARS
6248-298838-0034 IT WAS PART OF A QUANTITY OF FINE WINE LAID DOWN BY JOHN MALLATHORPE YEARS BEFORE AND ITS ORIGINAL OWNER WOULD HAVE BEEN DISGUSTED TO THINK THAT IT SHOULD EVER BE USED FOR THE MERE PURPOSE OF QUENCHING THIRST BUT ESTHER MAWSON
6248-298838-0035 CARRYING IT TO HER OWN SITTING ROOM SHE CAREFULLY CUT OFF THE THICK MASS OF SEALING WAX AT ITS NECK DREW THE CORK AND POURED A LITTLE OF THE WINE AWAY AND THAT DONE SHE UNLOCKED A SMALL BOX WHICH STOOD ON A CORNER OF HER DRESSING TABLE
6248-298838-0036 PRATT WOULD SUSPECT NOTHING EVEN IF HE DRUNK THE WHOLE BOTTLE ESTHER MAWSON HAD ANTICIPATED PRATT'S DESIRES IN THE WAY OF REFRESHMENT AND SHE NOW WENT TO A CUPBOARD AND TOOK FROM IT A PLATE OF SANDWICHES CAREFULLY SWATHED IN A NAPKIN
6248-298838-0037 SHE STOLE QUIETLY BACK TO THE DISUSED PART OF THE HOUSE AND SET HER PROVENDER BEFORE ITS EXPECTANT CONSUMER PRATT POURED OUT A GLASSFUL OF THE SHERRY AND DRANK IT EAGERLY
6248-298838-0038 SOME OF OLD JOHN MALLATHORPE'S NO DOUBT IT WAS HERE WHEN WE CAME ANYHOW REPLIED ESTHER WELL I SHALL HAVE TO GO
6248-298838-0039 AGREED ESTHER I HEARD HER ORDER THE CARRIAGE FOR HALF PAST TWO
6248-298838-0040 ASKED PRATT THAT BUTLER MAN FOR INSTANCE OR SERVANTS I'LL SEE TO IT REPLIED ESTHER REASSURINGLY I'LL LOCK THIS DOOR AND TAKE THE KEY UNTIL I COME BACK MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE SHE LOCKED PRATT IN THE OLD ROOM AND WENT OFF
6248-298838-0041 AND THE WILLING PRISONER ATE HIS SANDWICHES AND DRANK HIS SHERRY AND LOOKED OUT OF A MULLIONED WINDOW ON THE WIDE STRETCHES OF PARK AND COPPICE AND THE BREEZY MOORLANDS BEYOND HE INDULGED IN SOME REFLECTIONS NOT WHOLLY DEVOID OF SENTIMENT
6248-298838-0042 HE HAD CHERISHED DREAMS OF BECOMING THE VIRTUAL OWNER OF NORMANDALE ALWAYS CONFIDENT IN HIS OWN POWERS HE HAD BELIEVED THAT WITH TIME AND PATIENCE HE COULD HAVE PERSUADED NESTA MALLATHORPE TO MARRY HIM WHY NOT NOW
6248-298838-0043 ALL OWING TO THAT CURSED AND UNFORTUNATE CONTRETEMPS WITH PARRAWHITE THAT SEEMED UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE ALL HE COULD DO NOW WAS TO SAVE HIMSELF AND TO TAKE AS MUCH AS HE COULD GET MORE THAN ONCE THAT MORNING AS HE MADE HIS WAY ACROSS COUNTRY
6248-298838-0044 HE HAD REMEMBERED PARRAWHITE'S ADVICE TO TAKE CASH AND BE DONE WITH IT PERHAPS HE REFLECTED IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER STILL WHEN HE PRESENTLY BEGAN HIS FINAL RETREAT HE WOULD CARRY AWAY WITH HIM A LOT OF THE MALLATHORPE MONEY
6248-298838-0045 BUT BEFORE LONG PRATT INDULGED IN NO MORE REFLECTIONS SENTIMENT OR PRACTICAL HE HAD EATEN ALL HIS SANDWICHES HE HAD DRUNK THREE QUARTERS OF THE BOTTLE OF SHERRY AND SUDDENLY HE FELT UNUSUALLY DROWSY AND HE LAID HIS HEAD BACK IN HIS BIG CHAIR
