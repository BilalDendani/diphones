5918-46890-0000 CHASED BY PIRATES THE WEATHER NOW RAPIDLY BECAME FINER AND THE OCEAN NO LONGER LASHED INTO FURY BY THE BREATH OF THE TEMPEST SUBSIDED ONCE MORE INTO LONG REGULAR UNDULATIONS
5918-46890-0001 THE WIND HAULED GRADUALLY MORE ROUND FROM THE NORTHWARD TOO AND BLEW WARM AND BALMY A MOST WELCOME CHANGE AFTER THE RAW AND CHILLY WEATHER WE HAD LATELY EXPERIENCED WE ONCE MORE CRACKED ON SAIL UPON THE LITTLE WATER LILY
5918-46890-0002 AND ON THE MORNING FOLLOWING THAT UPON WHICH WE FILLED AWAY UPON OUR COURSE FINDING BY OBSERVATION THAT WE WERE WELL CLEAR OF THE CAPE AND THAT WE HAD PLENTY OF ROOM EVEN SHOULD THE WIND ONCE MORE BACK ROUND FROM THE WESTWARD
5918-46890-0003 AND STOOD AWAY ON A NOR' WEST AND BY WESTERLY COURSE NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE OCCURRED FOR MORE THAN A WEEK THE WEATHER CONTINUED SETTLED AND THE GLASS STOOD HIGH
5918-46890-0004 AND SUFFICIENTLY MODERATE TO PERMIT OF OUR CARRYING OUR JIB HEADED TOPSAIL AND DAY AFTER DAY WE FLEW FORWARD UPON OUR COURSE SELDOM MAKING LESS THAN TEN KNOTS IN THE HOUR AND OCCASIONALLY REACHING AS HIGH AS THIRTEEN WE WERE PERFECTLY JUBILANT
5918-46890-0005 FOR HAVING ROUNDED THE CAPE IN SAFETY WE NOW CONSIDERED OUR TROUBLES OVER AND OUR ULTIMATE SUCCESS AS CERTAIN WE WERE FAIRLY IN THE PACIFIC THE REGION OF FINE WEATHER AND OUR LITTLE BARKIE HAD BEHAVED SO WELL IN THE GALE THAT OUR CONFIDENCE IN HER SEAWORTHINESS
5918-46890-0006 WAS THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED SO THAT ALL FEAR OF FUTURE DANGER FROM BAD WEATHER WAS COMPLETELY TAKEN OFF OUR MINDS ONE MORNING THE WIND HAVING FALLEN CONSIDERABLY LIGHTER DURING THE PRECEDING NIGHT AS SOON AS BREAKFAST WAS OVER I ROUSED UP OUR SQUARE HEADED TOPSAIL
5918-46890-0007 EITHER A BARQUE OR A BRIG ANSWERED I THE LATTER I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THOUGH HE IS STILL TOO FAR AWAY FOR HIS MIZZEN MAST TO SHOW IF HE HAS ONE WHY D'YE THINK IT'S A BRIG HARRY QUERIED BOB
5918-46890-0008 HAVING SEEN ALL THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SEE AT PRESENT THEN IT'S THAT MURDERIN ALBATROSS AGAIN FOR A THOUSAND EJACULATED BOB IN A TONE OF DEEP DISGUST
5918-46890-0009 AND CONSEQUENTLY GOT A GOOD LONG LEG TO THE WEST'ARD OF US
5918-46890-0010 I WAS INCLINED TO TAKE THE SAME VIEW OF THE MATTER THAT BOB DID IT IS TRUE THAT WHEN ONCE A SHIP PASSES OUT OF SIGHT AT SEA YOU CAN NEVER BE SURE OF HER EXACT POSITION AFTERWARDS YET UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES
5918-46890-0011 TAKING THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND AND THE STATE OF THE WEATHER AS DATA UPON WHICH TO BASE YOUR ARGUMENT AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH THESE THE COURSE THE VESSEL WAS STEERING WHEN LAST SEEN OR THE PART OF THE WORLD TO WHICH YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE SHE IS BOUND
5918-46890-0012 IT IS ASTONISHING HOW NEAR A GUESS MAY BE AND IS NOT UNFREQUENTLY MADE AS TO HER WHEREABOUTS
5918-46890-0013 WHICH SHE UNDOUBTEDLY WOULD HAVE DONE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES MAKING A FAIR WIND OF IT AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS OF COURSE A POSSIBILITY OF OUR BEING MISTAKEN AS TO THE CRAFT IN SIGHT BEING THE PIRATE BRIG IT BEING BY NO MEANS AN UNUSUAL THING FOR VESSELS AS SMALL AS SHE WAS
5918-46890-0014 OR EVEN SMALLER TO VENTURE ROUND THE CAPE WELL SAID I PERHAPS IT WILL BE SAFEST BOB TO ASSUME FOR THE PRESENT THAT THIS BRIG IS THE ALBATROSS WHAT UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IS YOUR ADVICE
5918-46890-0015 WHICH OF US HAS THE WEATHER GAUGE D'YE THINK QUERIED BOB
5918-46890-0016 IF WE ARE BOTH GOING AT ABOUT THE SAME SPEED I SHOULD SAY WE SHALL PASS EXTREMELY CLOSE TO HER
5918-46890-0017 TO THE NORTHWARD RATHER EDGING DOWN TOWARDS US IF ANYTHING I THOUGHT AY AY CHUCKLED BOB IT AIN'T EVERY CRAFT AS CAN STICK HER BOWSPRIT INTO THE WIND'S EYE LIKE THIS HERE LITTLE BARKIE
5918-46890-0018 AND HERE WE ARE GOING AS CLOSE TO THE WIND AS HE IS AND EVERY THREAD RAMPING FULL TAKE HOLD OF HER A MINUTE HAL AND LET'S SEE WHAT THESE OLD EYES OF MINE CAN TELL US ABOUT THE STRANGER I TOOK HOLD OF THE TILLER
5918-46890-0019 AND BOB WENT ALOFT WITH THE DELIBERATION OF THE SEAMAN WHO IS IN NO PARTICULAR HURRY HAVING REACHED THE CROSS TREES HE STOOD UPON THEM WITH ONE HAND GRASPING THE PEAK HALLIARDS TO STEADY HIMSELF WHILST WITH THE OTHER HE SHADED HIS EYES
5918-46890-0020 WE'RE RAISING HER FAST HARRY MY BOY
5918-46890-0021 HE THEN WENT AS HIGH AS THE YARD OF THE TOPSAIL AND CLUNG THERE FOR A GOOD FIVE MINUTES READING ALL THE SIGNS WHICH A SEAMAN SEES IN THE ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE PECULIARITIES OF RIG SHAPE OF SAILS ETCETERA HAVING SATISFIED HIMSELF
5918-46890-0022 HE DESCENDED DELIBERATELY TO THE DECK EVIDENTLY RUMINATING DEEPLY
5918-46890-0023 THERE'S A FAMILIAR SORT OF A LOOK WITH THAT CRAFT AWAY YONDER
5918-46890-0024 AND I'VE NO MORAL DOUBT IN THE WORLD BUT WHAT IT'S THAT VILLAIN JOHNSON ALTHOUGH WE CAN'T BE SARTAIN OF IT UNTIL WE GETS A NEARER LOOK AT HER
5918-46890-0025 AND IF SO BY ALL MEANS KEEP IT EVEN IF WE HAS TO RUN THE GAUNTLET OF HER BROADSIDE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO ONCE LET'S BE TO WIND'ARD AND IN SUCH WEATHER AS THIS I WOULDN'T FEAR THE SMARTEST SQUARE RIGGED CRAFT THAT EVER WAS LAUNCHED
5918-46890-0026 WE COULD LEAD EM NO END OF A DANCE AND THEN GIVE EM THE SLIP A'TERWARDS WHEN WE WAS TIRED OF THE FUN SO MY ADVICE IS TO LUFF UP AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN NOT TOO CLOSE YE KNOW LAD LET HER GO THROUGH IT BUT SPRING YOUR LUFF ALL AS YOU CAN GET AND LET'S TRY WHAT OUR FRIEND YONDER IS MADE OF
5918-46890-0027 AS LONG AS WE'RE TO LEEWARD OF HIM THE GAME IS HIS BUT LET'S GET TO WIND'ARD OF HIM AND IT'S OURS TO DO WHAT WE LIKE WITH IT
5918-46890-0028 BUT THAT WOULD STILL BE LEAVING HIM THE WEATHER GAUGE AND I SAW FULLY AS CLEARLY AS BOB DID THE ADVANTAGE OF OBTAINING THIS IF POSSIBLE SO ON WE STOOD BOLDLY LYING A GOOD POINT HIGHER THAN WE HAD BEEN BEFORE STEERING
5918-46890-0029 YET KEEPING EVERY SAIL A GOOD CLEAN FULL AND DRAWING TO PERFECTION THE WIND HOWEVER WAS DROPPING FAST AND BY THE TIME THAT THE SUN WAS ON THE MERIDIAN WE WERE NOT GOING MORE THAN FIVE KNOTS THIS MADE ME EXTREMELY ANXIOUS
5918-46890-0030 MORE PARTICULARLY AS THE STRANGER PROVED A REMARKABLY FAST VESSEL SO MUCH SO THAT IT STILL REMAINED A MATTER OF DOUBT WHICH OF US WOULD CROSS THE OTHER BOB ON THE OTHER HAND WAS DELIGHTED BEYOND MEASURE
5918-46890-0031 STOUTLY AVOWING THAT THE FALLING BREEZE WAS LITTLE IF ANYTHING SHORT OF A DIVINE MANIFESTATION IN OUR FAVOUR HE DECLARED HIMSELF READY TO STAKE ALL HE WAS POSSESSED OF IN THE WORLD AND IF THE BRIG SHOULD TURN OUT TO BE THE PIRATE HE ACTUALLY WAS STAKING HIS LIFE
5918-46890-0032 ON OUR SPEED AS AGAINST THAT OF THE STRANGER IN LIGHT WINDS AND WAS ALREADY CHUCKLING IN ANTICIPATION OVER THAT CRAFT'S DISCOMFITURE SHE WAS WITHIN ABOUT FIVE MILES OF US STILL MAINTAINING HER RELATIVE POSITION OF ABOUT FOUR POINTS ON OUR LEE BOW
5918-46890-0033 WHEN BOB SERVED DINNER ON DECK AS WAS OUR CUSTOM IN FINE WEATHER WE WERE VERY BUSY WITH THE VIANDS KEEPING ONE EYE ALWAYS ON THE BRIG HOWEVER WHEN WE NOTICED SOMETHING FLUTTERING OVER HER TAFFRAIL
5918-46890-0034 THE STARS AND STRIPES AND A PENNANT EXCLAIMED HE WITH HIS EYE STILL AT THE TUBE LORD BLESS US FOR THE TWO PRETTY INNOCENTS HE TAKES US FOR HARRY BUT THERE OF COURSE HE DON'T KNOW AS WE'VE GOT HIS CHARACTER AND ALL ABOUT HIM AT OUR FINGERS ENDS
5918-46890-0035 WELL ANYHOW WE WON'T BE BEHINDHAND WITH HIM IN THE MATTER OF POLITENESS AND THEREWITH MASTER BOB DIVED BELOW RETURNING IN A MOMENT WITH OUR ENSIGN AND CLUB BURGEE IN HIS HAND WHICH HE BENT TO THEIR RESPECTIVE HALLIARDS AND RAN THEM UP
5918-46890-0036 THE ONE TO OUR GAFF END AND THE OTHER TO OUR MAST HEAD AS WE HAD BY THIS TIME FINISHED OUR MEAL BOB CLEARED THE THINGS AWAY MUTTERING SOMETHING ABOUT HAVING PLENTY TO DO AFORE LONG BESIDES EATING AND DRINKING
5918-46890-0037 OUR COLOURS HAD NOT BEEN DISPLAYED ABOVE A MINUTE WHEN FOUR SMALL BALLS WERE SEEN ASCENDING TO THE BRIG'S MAIN ROYAL MAST HEAD
5918-46890-0038 BOB AT ONCE ASSUMED THE DUTIES OF SIGNAL OFFICER BY ONCE MORE TAKING A PEEP THROUGH THE GLASS COMMERCIAL CODE PENNANT SAID HE AND THEN HE READ OUT THE FLAGS BENEATH IT RUN DOWN AND FETCH UP THE SIGNAL BOOK SAID I
5918-46890-0039 HE DID SO WE TURNED UP THE SIGNAL AND READ COME UNDER MY LEE I WISH TO SPEAK YOU THANK EE EJACULATED BOB NOT IF WE CAN HELP IT MISTER JOHNSON
5918-46890-0040 I RECKON TWOULD BE ABOUT THE MOST ONPROFITABLE CONWERSATION AS EVER THE CREW OF THIS HERE CUTTER TOOK A PART IN WE'VE GOT OUR OWN WHOLESOME PLANKS TO WALK ABOARD HERE WHEN WE WANTS ANY OF THAT SORT OF EXERCISE AND THOUGH THERE'S NOT MUCH TO BOAST OF IN THE WAY OF ROOM
5918-46890-0041 I DARE SAY THERE'S MORE OF THAT THAN WE'D FIND ON THE PLANK YOU'D GIVE US FOR A PARADE GROUND
5918-46890-0042 YOU ARE RIGHT BOB I REPLIED GLANCING AT THE COMPASS HE IS MORE THAN A POINT FARTHER AFT THAN HE WAS A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AGO BUT IS IT NOT POSSIBLE THAT WE ARE GIVING OURSELVES NEEDLESS UNEASINESS
5918-46890-0043 THAT CRAFT CERTAINLY HAS A LOOK OF THE ALBATROSS BUT WE ARE NOT SURE THAT IT IS HER AFTER ALL D'YE NOTICE HIS MAIN TOPMAST STAYSAIL HARRY RETURNED HE
5918-46890-0044 AND INTO THE SLINGS OF HIS FORE YARD HOW MANY VESSELS WILL YE SEE WITH A SAIL SHAPED LIKE THAT YET I NOTICED THAT HIS WAS THE OTHER DAY AND THERE'S THE RED RIBBON ROUND HIM TOO IN FACT IT'S THE ALBATROSS ALL OVER CONCLUDED HE
5918-46890-0045 WITH THE GLASS ONCE MORE AT HIS EYE IT WAS BUT TOO EVIDENT THAT BOB WAS RIGHT I HAD BEEN HOPING THAT THE GENERAL RESEMBLANCE OF THE BRIG IN SIGHT TO THE ALBATROSS WAS PURELY ACCIDENTAL BUT SHE WAS NOW WITHIN LESS THAN THREE MILES OF US
5918-46890-0046 AND EVEN WITHOUT THE AID OF THE TELESCOPE CERTAIN FEATURES IF I MAY SO TERM THEM WERE RECOGNISABLE WHICH IDENTIFIED HER BEYOND ALL QUESTION AS THE PIRATE BRIG WHAT SHALL WE DO ABOUT ANSWERING HIS SIGNAL BOB SAID I
5918-46890-0047 HE HAD NO CHANCE WITH US IN A LIGHT AIR LIKE THE PRESENT AND I ENTERTAINED STRONG HOPES OF BEING ABLE TO SLIP PAST HIM UNSCATHED WHEN I FELT SANGUINE OF OUR ABILITY TO GET FAIRLY AWAY FROM HIM IN A CHASE DEAD TO WINDWARD
5918-46890-0048 BUT HE EVIDENTLY HAD NO NOTION OF LETTING US HAVE OUR OWN WAY IN THIS MATTER WITHOUT A PRETTY VIGOROUS PROTEST ON HIS PART
5918-46890-0049 WE SAW THE BRIG SLOWLY LUFF INTO THE WIND HIS FORE SHEET WAS RAISED FOR A MOMENT A FLASH OF FLAME AND A PUFF OF WHITE SMOKE DARTED SUDDENLY FROM HIS FORECASTLE AND THEN WE SAW THE JETS SPOUTING UP WHERE THE SHOT STRUCK THE WATER AS IT CAME RICOCHETING TOWARDS US
5918-46890-0050 HE HAD AIMED APPARENTLY SO AS TO THROW THE SHOT ACROSS OUR FORE FOOT BUT IT FELL SHORT BY ABOUT FIFTY FEET DO THAT AGAIN YOU LUBBER EXCLAIMED BOB CONTEMPTUOUSLY APOSTROPHISING THE BRIG THREE MORE SUCH FOOL'S TRICKS AS THAT
5918-46890-0051 SEE HOW LONG IT TAKES HIM TO PAY OFF AG'IN HARRY VERY NEAR LOST HIS WAY ALTOGETHER WHEN HE'D A HAD TO BOX HER OFF WITH HIS HEADYARDS AND BY THE TIME HE'D DONE THAT WE SHOULD BE WELL CLEAR OF HIM WELL I DID THINK THE MAN HAD MORE SENSE THAN TO DO THE LIKE OF THAT
5918-46890-0052 FRIEND JOHNSON EVIDENTLY SAW HIS MISTAKE AS CLEARLY AS WE DID
5918-46890-0053 JUST AS WE WERE CROSSING HIS BOWS HOWEVER AND HAD GOT HIS MASTS IN TONE BY WHICH TIME HE HAD DRAWN CONSIDERABLY NEARER US THE BRIG FELL OFF A LITTLE NOT TO REPEAT HER FORMER ERROR AND AGAIN CAME THE FLASH THE SMOKE AND THE RINGING REPORT
5918-46890-0054 HERE IT COMES STRAIGHT FOR US THIS TIME AND NO MISTAKE EXCLAIMED BOB AS THE WATER JETS AGAIN MARKED THE COURSE OF THE SHOT SCALDINGS OUT OF THE ROAD ALL OF US THAT'S GOT THIN SKULLS CONTINUED HE
5918-46890-0055 AS THE SHOT CAME SKIPPING ACROSS THE WATER IN SUCH LONG BOUNDS AS SHOWED WE WERE WITHIN RANGE WELL MISSED ADDED HE AS THE SHOT STRUCK THE WATER CLOSE TO US AND BOUNDED FAIRLY OVER THE BOAT PASSING CLOSE BENEATH THE MAIN BOOM AND THE FOOT OF THE MAINSAIL
5918-46890-0056 WITHOUT INJURING SO MUCH AS A ROPEYARN THAT'S HIS LONG GUN BOB SAID I HIS BROADSIDE GUNS WOULD NEVER REACH SO FAR AS THIS AND THOUGH WE'RE JUST NOW IN RATHER WARM QUARTERS WE SHALL BE OUT OF RANGE AGAIN VERY SOON
5918-46890-0057 AND THEN I THINK WE NEED GIVE OURSELVES NO FURTHER TROUBLE CONCERNING HIM ANY WAY YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING VERY LIKE THE FULFILMENT OF THE WISH YOU EXPRESSED THE OTHER DAY
5918-46890-0058 I'LL WARRANT HE'S WALKING THE QUARTER DECK AT THIS MINUTE FIT TO BITE HIS FINGERS OFF WI VEXATION AT OUR SLIPPING PAST HIM IN THIS STYLE HERE ANOTHER SHOT FROM THE BRIG CAME BOUNDING AFTER US BUT WE OFFERED HIM A MUCH SMALLER MARK THAN BEFORE
5918-46890-0059 INASMUCH AS HE WAS NOW NEARLY DEAD ASTERN OF US AND WE CONSEQUENTLY PRESENTED AN END INSTEAD OF A BROADSIDE VIEW TO HIM THE SHOT SHAVED US PRETTY CLOSE TO WINDWARD NEVERTHELESS STRIKING THE WATER FOR THE LAST TIME JUST SHORT OF OUR TAFFRAIL
5918-46890-0060 AND SCURRYING ALONG AND PLOUGHING UP THE SURFACE CLOSE ENOUGH TO GIVE US A PRETTY COPIOUS SHOWER BATH OF SPRAY ERE IT FINALLY SANK JUST AHEAD OF US THE NEXT SHOT WHICH QUICKLY FOLLOWED PASSED ALMOST AS CLOSE TO LEEWARD AND THE THIRD CAME STRAIGHT ENOUGH
5918-46890-0061 BUT FELL JUST SHORT OF US AFTER THIS HE FIRED NO MORE VERY CLEVERLY MANAGED I CALL THAT HARRY SAID BOB AS SOON AS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE OUT OF RANGE WE CAN NOW TAKE THINGS QUIETLY AND AS IT'S YOUR WATCH BELOW
5918-46890-0062 I'D RECOMMEND YOU TO TURN IN AND GET A BIT OF A SNOOZE IT'S YOUR EIGHT HOURS OUT TO NIGHT MY LAD AND IF THE BREEZE SHOULD HAPPEN TO FRESHEN ABOUT SUNDOWN AND THAT CHAP COMES AFTER US AND BY THE PIPER HE MEANS THAT SAME FOR I'M BLEST IF HE ISN'T IN STAYS
5918-46890-0063 YOU'LL NEED TO KEEP BOTH EYES OPEN ALL YOUR WATCH THIS WAS GOOD ADVICE AND I AT ONCE PROCEEDED TO ADOPT IT CAUTIONING BOB TO BE SURE TO CALL ME WITHOUT DELAY IN THE EVENT OF ANY FURTHER COMPLICATION ARISING
5918-46890-0064 I HAD NOT BEEN BELOW ABOVE TWO MINUTES WHEN I HEARD HIS VOICE SHOUTING TO ME TO COME ON DECK AGAIN WONDERING WHAT WAS NOW IN THE WIND I SPRANG UP THE SHORT COMPANION LADDER AND MY EYE AT ONCE FALLING UPON THE BRIG WHICH WAS NOW DEAD ASTERN OF US
5918-46890-0065 HEADING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS OURSELVES THOUGH NOT LYING SO CLOSE TO THE WIND I SAW IN A MOMENT THAT OUR TROUBLES WERE NOT YET BY ANY MEANS OVER THE WIND HAD BY THIS TIME FALLEN SO LIGHT THAT WE WERE NOT MAKING ABOVE THREE KNOTS WAY THROUGH THE WATER
5918-46890-0066 WHILST THE PIRATE APPEARED BARELY TO HAVE STEERAGE WAY IN FACT HIS CANVAS WAS FLAPPING TO THE MAST WITH EVERY SLUGGISH ROLL WHICH THE VESSEL TOOK OVER THE LONG SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE SWELL
5918-46890-0067 FRIEND JOHNSON WAS EVIDENTLY GREATLY NETTLED AT OUR HAVING SLIPPED SO HANDSOMELY THROUGH HIS FINGERS AS WE HAD AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO HAVE A WORD OR TWO WITH US YET WHETHER WE WOULD OR NO FOR HE HAD LOWERED ONE OF HIS BOATS
5918-46890-0068 AND SHE WAS JUST LEAVING THE VESSEL IN CHASE I TOOK THE GLASS AND COUNTED SIX MEN AT THE OARS BESIDES ONE OR TWO I COULD NOT BE SURE WHICH IN THE STERN SHEETS THIS WAS SERIOUS INDEED FOR A LIGHT BOAT PROPELLED BY SIX GOOD OARSMEN
5918-46890-0069 SO I DIRECTED BOB TO KEEP THE CUTTER AWAY ABOUT THREE POINTS AND THEN LASH THE TILLER AND LEND ME A HAND TO GET OUR BALLOON CANVAS SET
5918-46890-0070 AND THEN WE GOT THE SPINNAKER TO THE BOWSPRIT END LEADING THE SHEET AFT TO THE MAIN BOOM AFTER WHICH WE TOOK IN OUR JIB AND STOPPED IT ALONG THE BOWSPRIT
5918-46890-0071 THIS ADDITIONAL SPREAD OF CANVAS COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT WE WERE RUNNING FAR ENOUGH OFF THE WIND TO PERMIT OF ITS DRAWING WELL MADE A PERCEPTIBLE DIFFERENCE IN OUR SPEED QUITE A KNOT I CONSIDERED AND BOB AGREED WITH ME NOW WHAT'S THE NEXT THING TO BE DONE HARRY INQUIRED HE
5918-46890-0072 THIS IS ALL VERY WELL AS FAR AS IT GOES BUT YON BOAT IS OVERHAULING US AT EVERY STROKE OF THE OARS AND WE'VE ONLY POSTPONED THE PLEASURE OF AN INTRODUCTION TO THE CHAPS UNLESS THE BREEZE HAPPENS TO FRESHEN UP A TRIFLE OF WHICH I SEES NO SIGNS JUST AT PRESENT
5918-46890-0073 I'VE MADE UP MY MIND I REPLIED WE MUST NOT BE TAKEN BOB I FEEL CONVINCED THAT OUR LIVES WOULD NOT BE WORTH AN HOUR'S PURCHASE IF WE FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THAT VILLAIN BUT EVEN SUPPOSING HE WERE TO STOP SHORT OF MURDER
5918-46890-0074 HIS MALIGNITY WOULD DOUBTLESS PROMPT HIM TO DESTROY THE LITTLE LILY AND BY SUCH AN ACT ALL OUR PAST EFFORTS WOULD BE NULLIFIED AND OUR FUTURE SUCCESS RENDERED EXTREMELY DOUBTFUL WE MUST FIGHT ROBERT MY MAN NOW THAT WE CAN NO LONGER RUN
5918-46890-0075 SO LET'S GET OUR GUN UP AND RIGGED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY BY THE TIME THAT WE HAVE IT READY THEY WILL BE WITHIN RANGE AND I THINK WE MAY PERSUADE THEM TO TURN BACK YET SO BE IT REPLIED BOB GLEEFULLY
5918-46890-0076 I'D ALWAYS RATHER FIGHT THAN RUN AWAY HARRY LAD AT LEAST WHEN IT'S ANYTHING LIKE A FAIR MATCH SO LET'S ROUSE UP THE POP GUN AND HAVE A SHY AT EM
5918-46890-0077 A FOUR POUND RIFLED PIECE WHICH WAS SPECIALLY MADE TO MY ORDER BY AN EMINENT FIRM IT WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LITTLE WEAPON EXQUISITELY FINISHED WAS A BREECH LOADER AND THREW A SOLID SHOT ABOUT A MILE AND A SHELL NEARLY HALF AS FAR AGAIN
5918-46890-0078 IT WAS MOUNTED ON A SWIVEL OR PIVOT WHICH WE HAD THE MEANS OF FIRMLY FIXING TO THE DECK WE GOT IT OUT AND UPON DECK AND SOON HAD IT MOUNTED AND READY FOR SERVICE BOB TOOK THE TILLER DESIRING ME TO WORK THE GUN
5918-46890-0079 AS I WAS NOT ONLY A MORE PRACTISED ARTILLERIST THAN HE BUT KNEW ALSO HOW TO HANDLE A BREECH LOADER AND I HAD THE KNACK SOMEHOW OF SHOOTING STRAIGHT I HAD IT LOADED AND WAS IN THE ACT OF LEVELLING IT WHEN BOB SAID
5918-46890-0080 SUPPOSE WE WAS TO LET THEM CHAPS GET A BIT NEARER HAL AFORE WE OPENS FIRE I'VE A NOTION THAT IF WE GETS EM WELL AWAY FROM THE BRIG AND WELL WITHIN RANGE OF OUR LITTLE BARKER THERE WE MIGHT GIVE EM SUCH A PEPPERING AFORE THEY COULD GET CLEAR OF US AG'IN AS WOULD SICKEN EM
5918-46890-0081 OF HAVING ANY MORE TO DO WITH US PERHAPS IT MIGHTN'T BE QUITE ONPOSSIBLE TO DESTR'Y THE BOAT ALTOGETHER AND THEN THERE'S SEVEN OR EIGHT GOOD HANDS WIPED OFF THE CHAP'S BOOKS THIS HERE AIN'T LIKE A ORDINARY ENEMY YOU SEE LAD
5918-46890-0082 AND THE MORE HARM WE CAN DO TO HIM THE MORE GOOD WE'LL BE DOING THE REST OF THE WORLD IT SOUNDED RATHER LIKE COLD BLOODED BARBARITY THIS PROPOSAL OF BOB'S TO ATTEMPT THE DESTRUCTION INSTEAD OF THE REPULSE OF THE BOAT IN PURSUIT OF US
5918-46890-0083 BUT EVERY WORD HE SAID IN SUPPORT OF HIS PROPOSITION WAS STRICTLY TRUE AND INDEED SOME SUCH IDEA HAD BEEN PRESENT IN MY OWN MIND SO I WITHHELD MY FIRE FOR A TIME AT LENGTH HOWEVER THEY WERE WITHIN HALF A MILE OF US
5918-46890-0084 THERE WAS A SHOUT FROM THE PEOPLE IN THE BOAT
5918-46890-0085 STRAIGHT AS IT COULD GO HARRY LAD BUT RATHER TOO MUCH ELEVATION TRY EM AGAIN BOY AND LOOK SMART ABOUT IT TOO FOR THEY'RE GIVING WAY AS IF THE DEVIL WAS BEHIND EM WHICH HE PROBABLY IS IF THEY DID BUT KNOW IT BOB RETURNED I KEEP COOL OLD MAN
5918-46890-0086 THERE'S NO HURRY YOU ATTEND TO THE STEERING OF THE CRAFT I'LL UNDERTAKE TO COOL THEIR COURAGE FOR THEM BEFORE THEY'RE VERY MUCH OLDER
5918-46890-0087 BUT IT'S GETTING TO BE RATHER TICKLISH WORK LAD AIN'T IT I WAS TOO BUSY WITH THE GUN TO REPLY JUST THEN AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT I FIRED ONCE MORE THIS TIME WE SAW THE SPLINTERS FLY FROM THE BOWS OF THE BOAT AND ONE OF THE OARSMEN SPRANG FROM HIS SEAT
5918-46890-0088 AND FELL BACK INTO THE ARMS OF THE MAN BEHIND HIM THERE WAS A MOMENT OF CONFUSION WITH THEM AND THEN WE SAW ONE OF THE MEN IN THE STERN SHEETS THERE WERE TWO OF THEM STEP ALONG THE THWARTS AND TAKE THE INJURED MAN'S PLACE THIS LOOKED LIKE A FIXED DETERMINATION TO COME ALONGSIDE AT ANY PRICE
5918-46890-0089 SO I THIS TIME INSERTED A SHELL INSTEAD OF A SOLID SHOT WHICH I HAD BEFORE BEEN FIRING ONCE MORE AFTER A VERY CAREFUL AIM THE LITTLE PIECE RANG OUT AND AGAIN THE SHOT REACHED ITS MARK THIS TIME WITH TERRIBLE EFFECT
5918-46890-0090 FOR THE SHELL EXPLODED AS IT PASSED THROUGH THE BOAT'S THIN PLANKING AND THE FRAGMENTS CONTINUING THEIR FLIGHT FORWARD TOLD SO SEVERELY AMONG THE CREW THAT IT APPEARED AS IF THEY WERE ALL MORE OR LESS HURT WE SAW FOUR FALL FROM THE THWARTS AT ALL EVENTS
5918-46890-0091 AND ALL HANDS CEASED PULLING WHILST THREE OF THE OARS SLIPPED UNNOTICED OVERBOARD I UNROVE THE SPINNAKER SHEET FROM THE MAIN BOOM BEFORE THE ASTONISHED BOB KNEW WHAT I WAS ABOUT LET GO THE HALLIARDS AND LET THE SAIL DOWN BY THE RUN
5918-46890-0092 AND THEN JUMPED TO THE JIB HALLIARDS AND HOISTED THE SAIL LIKE LIGHTNING NOW SHOUTED I LUFF YOU MAY BOB AND LET'S HEAVE THE CRAFT TO AND FINISH THE JOB FOR THEM AS I SAID THIS BOB PUT HIS HELM DOWN WHILST I HAULED THE JIB SHEET TO WINDWARD
5918-46890-0093 AND THEN I SPRANG AFT AGAIN TO THE GUN BY THIS TIME THEY HAD TAKEN TO THEIR OARS AGAIN BUT THERE WERE ONLY TWO OF THEM PULLING A SURE INDICATION OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR LAST SHOT HAD TOLD THEY WERE TURNING THE BOAT ROUND TO PULL BACK TO THE SHIP
5918-46890-0094 AND SEEING THIS I FELT SOME COMPUNCTION ABOUT FIRING ON THEM AGAIN AND SAID SO DON'T BE SUCH A SOFT HEARTED DONKEY HARRY LAD RETORTED BOB SETTLE THE WHOLE LOT IF YOU CAN BOY IT'LL ONLY BE SO MANY SKULKING CUT THROATS THE LESS IN THE WORLD
5918-46890-0095 MY IDEE IS THAT EVERY ONE OF THEM CHAPS AS WE CAN FINISH OFF IS ONE HONEST MAN'S LIFE SAVED
5918-46890-0096 I ACCORDINGLY LOADED AGAIN AND FIRED BUT PROBABLY FROM EXCITEMENT FIRED TOO HIGH AND THE MISSILE FLEW HARMLESSLY OVER THE BOAT THE NEXT TIME I WAS MORE CAREFUL AIMING WITH THE UTMOST DELIBERATION AT LENGTH I PULLED THE TRIGGER LINE
5918-46890-0097 ONE OF THEM SPRANG AFT AND CROUCHED DOWN DOING SOMETHING THAT WE COULD NOT MAKE OUT I TOOK THE GLASS AND THEN SAW THAT A LARGE GAP HAD BEEN MADE BY THE EXPLOSION OF THE SHELL THROUGH WHICH THE WATER WAS DOUBTLESS POURING RAPIDLY THERE WAS A MOVEMENT AMONG THE WOUNDED MEN
5918-46890-0098 AND ONE MAN JUMPED UPON A THWART AND WAVED HIS HAT TO THE BRIG EVIDENTLY AS A SIGNAL OF DISTRESS HER CAPTAIN HAD OF COURSE BEEN WATCHING US ALL THIS TIME AND SEEMED TO HAVE CONJECTURED THAT HIS PEOPLE WERE GETTING THE WORST OF IT FOR WE NOW SAW THAT HE HAD A SECOND BOAT IN THE WATER
5918-46890-0099 AND ON TAKING A LOOK AT THE BRIG THROUGH THE GLASS WE OBSERVED THAT HE HAD A TACKLE ON HIS MAIN YARD ARM WITH WHICH HE WAS HOISTING OUT A GUN TO PUT INTO THE BOAT IT IS TIME WE WERE OFF ONCE MORE BOB I REMARKED AS SOON AS I SAW THIS
5918-46890-0100 SO ANOTHER SHOT AT OUR FRIENDS HERE AND THEN WE'LL FILL AWAY THE BOAT WAS VERY MUCH DISABLED AND APPEARED TO BE SINKING GRADUALLY NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR EFFORTS TO KEEP HER AFLOAT FOR THEY WERE NOW BALING RAPIDLY BUT I THOUGHT IT BEST TO MAKE SURE OF HER
5918-46890-0101 SO ONCE MORE LOADED AND FIRED THE SHELL PASSED THROUGH HER STERN THIS TIME ALSO AND EXPLODED THERE WAS A SHRILL SCREAM FROM MORE THAN ONE AGONISED THROAT AND THE BALING AND PULLING CEASED ALTOGETHER
5918-46890-0102 SHE WAS NEARLY FULL OF WATER HER GUNWALE BEING BUT AN INCH OR TWO ABOVE THE SURFACE I SAW THREE OR FOUR FIGURES ROUSE THEMSELVES ON BOARD HER AND RECOMMENCE BALING FEEBLY BUT THEIR EFFORTS WERE USELESS SHE SANK LOWER AND LOWER
5918-46890-0103 AND AT LENGTH ROLLED HEAVILY BOTTOM UPWARDS THROWING HER WOUNDED CREW INTO THE WATER ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THERE WAS A FURIOUS SPLASHING AND BY THE AID OF THE GLASS I DISTINCTLY SAW THE DORSAL FINS OF SEVERAL SHARKS DARTING HERE AND THERE AMONG THEM
5918-46890-0104 WHILST OVER THE GLASSY SURFACE OF THE WATER A SHRIEK OR TWO CAME FAINTLY TOWARDS US IN LESS THAN A MINUTE ALL WAS OVER WITH THE MISERABLE WRETCHES THE VORACIOUS SHARKS MADE SHORT WORK OF IT WITH THEM
5918-46890-0105 TEARING LIVING AND DEAD ALIKE TO PIECES IN THEIR EAGERNESS TO OBTAIN A SHARE OF THE PREY AT THE MOMENT THAT THIS TRAGIC SCENE WAS ENACTING THE SECOND BOAT WAS ABOUT HALF WAY BETWEEN THE BRIG AND THOSE TO WHOSE ASSISTANCE SHE WAS HASTENING
5918-46890-0106 AND HER CREW HAD A NEARER AND MORE DISTINCT VIEW OF THE HORRIBLE DETAILS OF THE CATASTROPHE THAN WE HAD
5918-46890-0107 AND THEN WITH A VENGEFUL SHOUT GAVE WAY MORE ENERGETICALLY THAN BEFORE BUT I FELT LITTLE APPREHENSION ON THEIR ACCOUNT THE DYING BREEZE HAD REVIVED SOMEWHAT AND THE LILY WAS NOW STEALING ALONG THOUGH WITH SCARCELY A RIPPLE AT HER SHARP BOWS ABOUT FIVE KNOTS
5918-46890-0108 AND THE WATER LOOKED RATHER DARKER TO WINDWARD AS THOUGH THE WIND WAS INCLINED TO COME STILL STRONGER THE PIRATES TUGGED AT THEIR OARS WITH MIGHT AND MAIN PASSING WITHIN OAR'S LENGTH OF THE WRECK OF THE FIRST BOAT WHEN THEY AGAIN RAISED A FURIOUS YELL
5918-46890-0109 STRAINING AWAY AT THEIR STOUT ASH BLADES UNTIL THEY MADE THEM BEND LIKE WILLOW WANDS THEY GAINED ON US CONSIDERABLY WITHIN THE FIRST TEN MINUTES OR QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND I SAW SOME OF THE CREW PREPARING TO FIRE THE GUN WHICH WAS MOUNTED IN THE BOAT'S BOWS
5918-46890-0110 JUDGING THAT MORE POWDER WOULD HAVE TO BE BURNED AFTER ALL I ONCE MORE LOADED OUR LITTLE PIECE CHARGING WITH SHELL AS BEFORE AND WHILST I WAS DOING THIS OUR PURSUERS OPENED FIRE UPON US THEY MISCALCULATED THEIR DISTANCE HOWEVER OR THE POWERS OF THEIR GUN
5918-46890-0111 FOR THE SHOT FELL CONSIDERABLY SHORT OF US MUCH TO BOB'S DELIGHT TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION BY THE UTTERANCE OF A FEW REMARKS OF SUCH BITING SARCASM AND RAILLERY THAT THEY WOULD INFALLIBLY HAVE STILL FURTHER INCENSED THE INDIVIDUALS TO WHOM THEY WERE ADDRESSED COULD THEY BUT HAVE HEARD THEM
5918-46890-0112 I TOO WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE THE SHOT FALL SHORT FOR IT PLACED US ON SOMEWHAT MORE EQUAL TERMS THAN I HAD DARED TO HOPE THE BOAT WAS A LARGE ONE PROBABLY THEIR LAUNCH AND PULLED TEN OARS AND THERE WERE THREE MEN IN THE BOWS WORKING THE GUN
5918-46890-0113 AND THE COXSWAIN AFT STEERING MAKING ALTOGETHER FOURTEEN HANDS VERY HEAVY ODDS BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND THE BOAT WAS HEAVY AND HER CREW AFTER THEIR ALREADY LONG PULL COULD NOT MAINTAIN THE VIOLENT EXERTIONS THEY WERE NOW PUTTING FORTH VERY MUCH LONGER
5918-46890-0114 AND A VERY TRIFLING ABATEMENT IN THAT DIRECTION WOULD ENABLE US TO SLIP AWAY FROM THEM AFTER ALL AND MOREOVER AS THEY WERE NOW WITHIN RANGE OF OUR GUN WHICH BEING RIFLED THREW A SHOT MUCH FARTHER THAN THEIR SMOOTH BORE
5918-46890-0115 THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY OF OUR BEING ABLE SO FAR TO DISABLE THEM AS TO COMPEL THEM TO GIVE UP THE CHASE I ACCORDINGLY LEVELLED THE BREECH LOADER AND THEN WAITED FOR A FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY TO FIRE AT LENGTH IT CAME
5918-46890-0116 THE SHELL ENTERED THE STARBOARD BOW OF THE PURSUING BOAT ABOUT MIDWAY BETWEEN HER GUNWALE AND HER WATER LINE AND IMMEDIATELY TO OUR GREAT SURPRISE THERE WAS A VIOLENT EXPLOSION ON BOARD HER A VIVID FLASH OF FLAME DARTED UPWARD AND OUTWARD
5918-46890-0117 THE SIDES OF THE BOAT APPEARED TO BE VIOLENTLY WRENCHED APART AT THEIR JUNCTION WITH THE STEM THE GUN AND ITS CARRIAGE ROSE HEAVILY IN THE AIR ABOUT TEN FEET AND FELL WITH A TREMENDOUS SPLASH INTO THE SEA AND OARS AND MEN WERE FLUNG WILDLY ABOUT
5918-46890-0118 MANY OF THEM BEING BLOWN FAIRLY OVERBOARD WHILST A DENSE CLOUD OF SMOKE AROSE AND FOR A MOMENT HID EVERYTHING FROM OUR VIEW
