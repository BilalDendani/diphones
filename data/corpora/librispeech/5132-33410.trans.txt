5132-33410-0000 SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS POSSIBLY THIS BOOK SEEMS MADE UP OF FOUR OR FIVE DISCONNECTED STORIES THEY ARE HOWEVER STRUNG UPON ONE THREAD THE WESTWARD EMIGRATION FROM NORWAY
5132-33410-0001 IT GIVES THE GENERAL SETTING THAT CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE BOOK IN COSTUME HOUSES IDEALS HABITS
5132-33410-0002 THE MOTHER COUNTRY IT IS REALLY AN INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER AS FOR THE OTHER STORIES THEY ARE DISTINCTLY STEPS IN THE PROGRESS OF THE PLOT
5132-33410-0003 A CHAIN OF ISLANDS LOOSELY CONNECTS NORWAY WITH AMERICA ORKNEYS AND SHETLANDS FAROES ICELAND GREENLAND
5132-33410-0004 DISCOVERIES WERE MADE BY ACCIDENT
5132-33410-0005 THESE TWO POINTS THE ISLAND CONNECTION THAT MADE POSSIBLE THE LONG VOYAGE FROM NORWAY TO AMERICA AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF STORM TO DISCOVERY I HAVE STATED IN THE BOOK ONLY DRAMATICALLY
5132-33410-0006 I EMPHASIZE THEM HERE HOPING THAT THE TEACHER WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE CHILDREN SEE THEM AND POSSIBLY THAT THEY STATE THEM ABSTRACTLY LET ME SPEAK AS TO THE PROPER IMAGING OF THE STORIES
5132-33410-0007 I HAVE NOT OFTEN INTERRUPTED INCIDENT WITH SPECIAL DESCRIPTION NOT BECAUSE I DO NOT CONSIDER THE GETTING OF VIVID AND DETAILED IMAGES MOST NECESSARY TO FULL ENJOYMENT
5132-33410-0008 BUT BECAUSE I TRUSTED TO THE PICTURES OF THIS BOOK AND TO THE TEACHER TO DO WHAT SEEMED TO ME INARTISTIC TO DO IN THE STORY
5132-33410-0009 SOME OF THESE DESCRIPTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS I HAVE INTRODUCED INTO THE BOOK IN THE FORM OF NOTES HOPING THAT THE CHILDREN
5132-33410-0010 BEGIN THE HABIT OF REFERENCE READING
5132-33410-0011 AND WILL GREATLY ASSIST IN GIVING REALITY AND DEFINITENESS
5132-33410-0012 MATERIALS FOR THIS STUDY ARE NOT DIFFICULT OF ACCESS FOREIGN COLORED PHOTOGRAPHS OF NORWEGIAN LANDSCAPE ARE BECOMING COMMON IN OUR ART STORES THERE ARE GOOD ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE
5132-33410-0013 GEOGRAPHICAL WORKS REFERRED TO IN THE BOOK LIST THESE
5132-33410-0014 COAST OF NORWAY BY WALTON TRAVELS IN THE ISLAND OF ICELAND BY MACKENZIE VOYAGE
5132-33410-0015 BY J P GAIMARD IF THE LANDSCAPE IS STUDIED FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF FORMATION THE IMAGES WILL BE MORE ACCURATE AND MORE EASILY GAINED AND
5132-33410-0016 THE STUDY WILL HAVE A GENERAL VALUE THAT WILL CONTINUE PAST THE READING OF THESE STORIES INTO ALL WORK IN GEOGRAPHY TRUSTWORTHY PICTURES OF NORSE HOUSES AND COSTUMES ARE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN IN
5132-33410-0017 VIKING AGE AND STORY OF NORWAY BY BOYESEN G P PUTNAM'S SONS NEW YORK ARE MANY COPIES OF NORSE ANTIQUITIES IN THE FASHION OF WEAPONS SHIELD BOSSES
5132-33410-0018 COINS JEWELRY WOOD CARVING THESE ARE OF COURSE ACCURATE BUT OF LITTLE INTEREST TO CHILDREN THEIR
5132-33410-0019 METAL WORKING AND WOOD CARVING WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT ARTS OF THE NORSE IF CHILDREN STUDY
5132-33410-0020 AND AN APPRECIATION OF THEIR POWER THEY MAY PERHAPS MAKE SOMETHING TO MERELY ILLUSTRATE NORSE WORK FOR INSTANCE A CARVED SHIP'S HEAD OR A COPPER SHIELD
5132-33410-0021 BUT BETTER THEY MAY APPLY NORSE IDEAS OF FORM AND DECORATION AND NORSE PROCESSES
5132-33410-0022 THIS WORK SHOULD LEAD OUT
5132-33410-0023 FREQUENT DRAWN OR PAINTED ILLUSTRATION BY THE CHILDREN OF COSTUMES LANDSCAPES HOUSES FEAST HALLS AND SHIPS WILL HELP TO MAKE THESE IMAGES CLEAR BUT
5132-33410-0024 IF AT LAST THROUGH THE DRAMATIZATION AND THE HANDWORK THE CHILDREN SHOULD COME INTO SUFFICIENT UNDERSTANDING AND ENTHUSIASM
5132-33410-0025 TO TURN SKALDS AND COMPOSE SONGS IN THE NORSE MANNER THIS REQUIRES ONLY A SMALL VOCABULARY AND A ROUGH FEELING FOR SIMPLE RHYTHM BUT AN INTENSITY OF EMOTION AND A GREAT VIVIDNESS OF IMAGE
5132-33410-0026 THESE NORSE STORIES HAVE TO MY THINKING THREE VALUES THE MEN
5132-33410-0027 THE FAITHFULNESS TO PLIGHTED WORD
5132-33410-0028 AGAIN IN FORM AND IN MATTER OLD NORSE LITERATURE IS WELL WORTH OUR READING I SHOULD DEEM IT A GREAT THING ACCOMPLISHED IF THE CHILDREN WHO READ THESE STORIES
5132-33410-0029 TEMPTED AFTER A WHILE TO READ THOSE FINE OLD BOOKS TO ENJOY THE TALES TO APPRECIATE STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS AND SIMPLICITY OF STYLE
5132-33410-0030 ERICSSON AND THE OTHERS SEEMS TO ME TO BE NOT TO LEARN THE FACT THAT NORSEMEN DISCOVERED AMERICA BEFORE COLUMBUS DID BUT TO GAIN A CONCEPTION OF THE CONDITIONS OF EARLY NAVIGATION
5132-33410-0031 OF THE DANGERS OF THE SEA AND A CONSEQUENT REALIZATION OF
5132-33410-0032 NECESSARY TO BE DONE BEFORE
5132-33410-0033 NORSE STORY IS ONLY ONE CHAPTER IN THAT TALE OF AMERICAN DISCOVERY
5132-33410-0034 ON THE SUBJECT THAT WAS ONCE FOLLOWED BY
5132-33410-0035 THE IDEA IN IT IS TO GIVE IMPORTANCE SEQUENCE REASONABLENESS BROAD CONNECTIONS TO THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA
5132-33410-0036 THE HEAD OF THE HISTORY DEPARTMENT WHO PLANNED THIS COURSE SAYS IT IS IN A SENSE A DRAMATIZATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE FOLLOWING IS A BARE TOPICAL OUTLINE OF THE WORK EVOLUTION
5132-33410-0037 OF THE FORMS OF BOATS VIKING TALES A CRUSADE AS A TALE OF TRAVEL AND DISCOVERY MONASTERIES AS CENTERS OF WORK PRINTING
