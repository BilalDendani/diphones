1061-142358-0000 ADAM ON A WORKING DAY NOTWITHSTANDING MISTER CRAIG'S PROPHECY THE DARK BLUE CLOUD DISPERSED ITSELF WITHOUT HAVING PRODUCED THE THREATENED CONSEQUENCES THE WEATHER AS HE OBSERVED THE NEXT MORNING THE WEATHER YOU SEE S A TICKLISH THING
1061-142358-0001 AN A FOOL ULL HIT ON'T SOMETIMES WHEN A WISE MAN MISSES THAT'S WHY THE ALMANECKS GET SO MUCH CREDIT IT'S ONE O THEM CHANCY THINGS AS FOOLS THRIVE ON
1061-142358-0002 THIS UNREASONABLE BEHAVIOUR OF THE WEATHER HOWEVER COULD DISPLEASE NO ONE ELSE IN HAYSLOPE BESIDES MISTER CRAIG ALL HANDS WERE TO BE OUT IN THE MEADOWS THIS MORNING AS SOON AS THE DEW HAD RISEN
1061-142358-0003 THE WIVES AND DAUGHTERS DID DOUBLE WORK IN EVERY FARMHOUSE THAT THE MAIDS MIGHT GIVE THEIR HELP IN TOSSING THE HAY AND WHEN ADAM WAS MARCHING ALONG THE LANES WITH HIS BASKET OF TOOLS OVER HIS SHOULDER HE CAUGHT THE SOUND OF JOCOSE TALK AND RINGING LAUGHTER FROM BEHIND THE HEDGES
1061-142358-0004 LIKE THOSE CLUMSY BELLS ROUND THE COWS NECKS IT HAS RATHER A COARSE SOUND WHEN IT COMES CLOSE AND MAY EVEN GRATE ON YOUR EARS PAINFULLY BUT HEARD FROM FAR OFF IT MINGLES VERY PRETTILY WITH THE OTHER JOYOUS SOUNDS OF NATURE MEN'S MUSCLES MOVE BETTER WHEN THEIR SOULS ARE MAKING MERRY MUSIC
1061-142358-0005 THOUGH THEIR MERRIMENT IS OF A POOR BLUNDERING SORT NOT AT ALL LIKE THE MERRIMENT OF BIRDS AND PERHAPS THERE IS NO TIME IN A SUMMER'S DAY MORE CHEERING THAN WHEN THE WARMTH OF THE SUN IS JUST BEGINNING TO TRIUMPH OVER THE FRESHNESS OF THE MORNING
1061-142358-0006 WHEN THERE IS JUST A LINGERING HINT OF EARLY COOLNESS TO KEEP OFF LANGUOR UNDER THE DELICIOUS INFLUENCE OF WARMTH THE REASON ADAM WAS WALKING ALONG THE LANES AT THIS TIME WAS BECAUSE HIS WORK FOR THE REST OF THE DAY LAY AT A COUNTRY HOUSE ABOUT THREE MILES OFF
1061-142358-0007 WHICH WAS BEING PUT IN REPAIR FOR THE SON OF A NEIGHBOURING SQUIRE AND HE HAD BEEN BUSY SINCE EARLY MORNING WITH THE PACKING OF PANELS DOORS AND CHIMNEY PIECES IN A WAGGON WHICH WAS NOW GONE ON BEFORE HIM WHILE JONATHAN BURGE HIMSELF HAD RIDDEN TO THE SPOT ON HORSEBACK
1061-142358-0008 TO AWAIT ITS ARRIVAL AND DIRECT THE WORKMEN THIS LITTLE WALK WAS A REST TO ADAM AND HE WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY UNDER THE CHARM OF THE MOMENT IT WAS SUMMER MORNING IN HIS HEART AND HE SAW HETTY IN THE SUNSHINE A SUNSHINE WITHOUT GLARE
1061-142358-0009 WITH SLANTING RAYS THAT TREMBLE BETWEEN THE DELICATE SHADOWS OF THE LEAVES HE THOUGHT YESTERDAY WHEN HE PUT OUT HIS HAND TO HER AS THEY CAME OUT OF CHURCH THAT THERE WAS A TOUCH OF MELANCHOLY KINDNESS IN HER FACE SUCH AS HE HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE
1061-142358-0010 AND HE TOOK IT AS A SIGN THAT SHE HAD SOME SYMPATHY WITH HIS FAMILY TROUBLE POOR FELLOW THAT TOUCH OF MELANCHOLY CAME FROM QUITE ANOTHER SOURCE BUT HOW WAS HE TO KNOW WE LOOK AT THE ONE LITTLE WOMAN'S FACE WE LOVE AS WE LOOK AT THE FACE OF OUR MOTHER EARTH
1061-142358-0011 HITHERTO HE HAD FELT KEENLY THE DANGER THAT SOME OTHER MAN MIGHT STEP IN AND GET POSSESSION OF HETTY'S HEART AND HAND WHILE HE HIMSELF WAS STILL IN A POSITION THAT MADE HIM SHRINK FROM ASKING HER TO ACCEPT HIM EVEN IF HE HAD HAD A STRONG HOPE THAT SHE WAS FOND OF HIM
1061-142358-0012 AND HIS HOPE WAS FAR FROM BEING STRONG HE HAD BEEN TOO HEAVILY BURDENED WITH OTHER CLAIMS TO PROVIDE A HOME FOR HIMSELF AND HETTY A HOME SUCH AS HE COULD EXPECT HER TO BE CONTENT WITH AFTER THE COMFORT AND PLENTY OF THE FARM
1061-142358-0013 LIKE ALL STRONG NATURES ADAM HAD CONFIDENCE IN HIS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE HE FELT SURE HE SHOULD SOME DAY IF HE LIVED BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A FAMILY AND MAKE A GOOD BROAD PATH FOR HIMSELF
1061-142358-0014 TO BE SURE IF SHE LOVED HIM VERY MUCH SHE WOULD BE CONTENT TO WAIT FOR HIM BUT DID SHE LOVE HIM HIS HOPES HAD NEVER RISEN SO HIGH THAT HE HAD DARED TO ASK HER HE WAS CLEAR SIGHTED ENOUGH TO BE AWARE THAT HER UNCLE AND AUNT WOULD HAVE LOOKED KINDLY ON HIS SUIT
1061-142358-0015 BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO COME TO ANY BUT FLUCTUATING CONCLUSIONS ABOUT HETTY'S FEELINGS SHE WAS LIKE A KITTEN AND HAD THE SAME DISTRACTINGLY PRETTY LOOKS THAT MEANT NOTHING FOR EVERYBODY THAT CAME NEAR HER
1061-142358-0016 BUT NOW HE COULD NOT HELP SAYING TO HIMSELF THAT THE HEAVIEST PART OF HIS BURDEN WAS REMOVED AND THAT EVEN BEFORE THE END OF ANOTHER YEAR HIS CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT BE BROUGHT INTO A SHAPE THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO THINK OF MARRYING
1061-142358-0017 IT WOULD ALWAYS BE A HARD STRUGGLE WITH HIS MOTHER HE KNEW SHE WOULD BE JEALOUS OF ANY WIFE HE MIGHT CHOOSE AND SHE HAD SET HER MIND ESPECIALLY AGAINST HETTY PERHAPS FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THAT SHE SUSPECTED HETTY TO BE THE WOMAN HE HAD CHOSEN
1061-142358-0018 IT WOULD NEVER DO HE FEARED FOR HIS MOTHER TO LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS MARRIED AND YET HOW HARD SHE WOULD THINK IT IF HE ASKED HER TO LEAVE HIM YES THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN TO BE GONE THROUGH WITH HIS MOTHER
1061-142358-0019 BUT IT WAS A CASE IN WHICH HE MUST MAKE HER FEEL THAT HIS WILL WAS STRONG
1061-142358-0020 FOR HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT THEY SHOULD ALL LIVE TOGETHER TILL SETH WAS MARRIED AND THEY MIGHT HAVE BUILT A BIT THEMSELVES TO THE OLD HOUSE AND MADE MORE ROOM
1061-142358-0021 BUT ADAM HAD NO SOONER CAUGHT HIS IMAGINATION LEAPING FORWARD IN THIS WAY MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE THAN HE CHECKED HIMSELF A PRETTY BUILDING I'M MAKING WITHOUT EITHER BRICKS OR TIMBER I'M UP THE GARRET A'READY AND HAVEN'T SO MUCH AS DUG THE FOUNDATION
1061-142358-0022 WHENEVER ADAM WAS STRONGLY CONVINCED OF ANY PROPOSITION IT TOOK THE FORM OF A PRINCIPLE IN HIS MIND IT WAS KNOWLEDGE TO BE ACTED ON AS MUCH AS THE KNOWLEDGE THAT DAMP WILL CAUSE RUST PERHAPS HERE LAY THE SECRET OF THE HARDNESS HE HAD ACCUSED HIMSELF OF
1061-142358-0023 HE HAD TOO LITTLE FELLOW FEELING WITH THE WEAKNESS THAT ERRS IN SPITE OF FORESEEN CONSEQUENCES WITHOUT THIS FELLOW FEELING HOW ARE WE TO GET ENOUGH PATIENCE AND CHARITY TOWARDS OUR STUMBLING FALLING COMPANIONS IN THE LONG AND CHANGEFUL JOURNEY
1061-142358-0024 AND ADAM HAD AT PRESENT ONLY LEARNED THE ALPHABET OF IT IN HIS FATHER'S SUDDEN DEATH WHICH BY ANNIHILATING IN AN INSTANT ALL THAT HAD STIMULATED HIS INDIGNATION HAD SENT A SUDDEN RUSH OF THOUGHT AND MEMORY OVER WHAT HAD CLAIMED HIS PITY AND TENDERNESS
1061-142358-0025 BUT IT WAS ADAM'S STRENGTH NOT ITS CORRELATIVE HARDNESS THAT INFLUENCED HIS MEDITATIONS THIS MORNING HE HAD LONG MADE UP HIS MIND THAT IT WOULD BE WRONG AS WELL AS FOOLISH FOR HIM TO MARRY A BLOOMING YOUNG GIRL
1061-142358-0026 SO LONG AS HE HAD NO OTHER PROSPECT THAN THAT OF GROWING POVERTY WITH A GROWING FAMILY AND HIS SAVINGS HAD BEEN SO CONSTANTLY DRAWN UPON BESIDES THE TERRIBLE SWEEP OF PAYING FOR SETH'S SUBSTITUTE IN THE MILITIA THAT HE HAD NOT ENOUGH MONEY BEFOREHAND TO FURNISH EVEN A SMALL COTTAGE
1061-142358-0027 AND KEEP SOMETHING IN RESERVE AGAINST A RAINY DAY HE HAD GOOD HOPE THAT HE SHOULD BE FIRMER ON HIS LEGS BY AND BY BUT HE COULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITH A VAGUE CONFIDENCE IN HIS ARM AND BRAIN HE MUST HAVE DEFINITE PLANS AND SET ABOUT THEM AT ONCE
1061-142358-0028 THE PARTNERSHIP WITH JONATHAN BURGE WAS NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF AT PRESENT THERE WERE THINGS IMPLICITLY TACKED TO IT THAT HE COULD NOT ACCEPT BUT ADAM THOUGHT THAT HE AND SETH MIGHT CARRY ON A LITTLE BUSINESS FOR THEMSELVES IN ADDITION TO THEIR JOURNEYMAN'S WORK
1061-142358-0029 BY BUYING A SMALL STOCK OF SUPERIOR WOOD AND MAKING ARTICLES OF HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE FOR WHICH ADAM HAD NO END OF CONTRIVANCES SETH MIGHT GAIN MORE BY WORKING AT SEPARATE JOBS UNDER ADAM'S DIRECTION THAN BY HIS JOURNEYMAN'S WORK
1061-142358-0030 AND ADAM IN HIS OVERHOURS COULD DO ALL THE NICE WORK THAT REQUIRED PECULIAR SKILL THE MONEY GAINED IN THIS WAY WITH THE GOOD WAGES HE RECEIVED AS FOREMAN WOULD SOON ENABLE THEM TO GET BEFOREHAND WITH THE WORLD SO SPARINGLY AS THEY WOULD ALL LIVE NOW
1061-142358-0031 NO SOONER HAD THIS LITTLE PLAN SHAPED ITSELF IN HIS MIND THAN HE BEGAN TO BE BUSY WITH EXACT CALCULATIONS ABOUT THE WOOD TO BE BOUGHT AND THE PARTICULAR ARTICLE OF FURNITURE THAT SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN FIRST A KITCHEN CUPBOARD OF HIS OWN CONTRIVANCE
1061-142358-0032 WITH SUCH AN INGENIOUS ARRANGEMENT OF SLIDING DOORS AND BOLTS SUCH CONVENIENT NOOKS FOR STOWING HOUSEHOLD PROVENDER AND SUCH A SYMMETRICAL RESULT TO THE EYE THAT EVERY GOOD HOUSEWIFE WOULD BE IN RAPTURES WITH IT AND FALL THROUGH ALL THE GRADATIONS OF MELANCHOLY LONGING TILL HER HUSBAND PROMISED TO BUY IT FOR HER
1061-142358-0033 ADAM PICTURED TO HIMSELF MISSUS POYSER EXAMINING IT WITH HER KEEN EYE AND TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND OUT A DEFICIENCY AND OF COURSE CLOSE TO MISSUS POYSER STOOD HETTY AND ADAM WAS AGAIN BEGUILED FROM CALCULATIONS AND CONTRIVANCES INTO DREAMS AND HOPES
1061-142358-0034 YES HE WOULD GO AND SEE HER THIS EVENING IT WAS SO LONG SINCE HE HAD BEEN AT THE HALL FARM HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GO TO THE NIGHT SCHOOL TO SEE WHY BARTLE MASSEY HAD NOT BEEN AT CHURCH YESTERDAY FOR HE FEARED HIS OLD FRIEND WAS ILL
1061-142358-0035 BUT UNLESS HE COULD MANAGE BOTH VISITS THIS LAST MUST BE PUT OFF TILL TO MORROW THE DESIRE TO BE NEAR HETTY AND TO SPEAK TO HER AGAIN WAS TOO STRONG AS HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO THIS HE WAS COMING VERY NEAR TO THE END OF HIS WALK
1061-142358-0036 WITHIN THE SOUND OF THE HAMMERS AT WORK ON THE REFITTING OF THE OLD HOUSE THE SOUND OF TOOLS TO A CLEVER WORKMAN WHO LOVES HIS WORK IS LIKE THE TENTATIVE SOUNDS OF THE ORCHESTRA TO THE VIOLINIST WHO HAS TO BEAR HIS PART IN THE OVERTURE
1061-142358-0037 THE STRONG FIBRES BEGIN THEIR ACCUSTOMED THRILL AND WHAT WAS A MOMENT BEFORE JOY VEXATION OR AMBITION BEGINS ITS CHANGE INTO ENERGY ALL PASSION BECOMES STRENGTH WHEN IT HAS AN OUTLET FROM THE NARROW LIMITS OF OUR PERSONAL LOT
1061-142358-0038 IN THE LABOUR OF OUR RIGHT ARM THE CUNNING OF OUR RIGHT HAND OR THE STILL CREATIVE ACTIVITY OF OUR THOUGHT LOOK AT ADAM THROUGH THE REST OF THE DAY AS HE STANDS ON THE SCAFFOLDING WITH THE TWO FEET RULER IN HIS HAND
1061-142358-0039 WHISTLING LOW WHILE HE CONSIDERS HOW A DIFFICULTY ABOUT A FLOOR JOIST OR A WINDOW FRAME IS TO BE OVERCOME OR AS HE PUSHES ONE OF THE YOUNGER WORKMEN ASIDE AND TAKES HIS PLACE IN UPHEAVING A WEIGHT OF TIMBER SAYING LET ALONE LAD
1061-142358-0040 TOSSED ABOUT LIKE TRODDEN MEADOW GRASS WHENEVER HE TAKES OFF HIS PAPER CAP AND WITH THE STRONG BARYTONE VOICE BURSTING EVERY NOW AND THEN INTO LOUD AND SOLEMN PSALM TUNES AS IF SEEKING AN OUTLET FOR SUPERFLUOUS STRENGTH YET PRESENTLY CHECKING HIMSELF
1061-142358-0041 APPARENTLY CROSSED BY SOME THOUGHT WHICH JARS WITH THE SINGING PERHAPS IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN ALREADY IN THE SECRET YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE GUESSED WHAT SAD MEMORIES WHAT WARM AFFECTION WHAT TENDER FLUTTERING HOPES HAD THEIR HOME IN THIS ATHLETIC BODY WITH THE BROKEN FINGER NAILS
1061-142358-0042 IN THIS ROUGH MAN WHO KNEW NO BETTER LYRICS THAN HE COULD FIND IN THE OLD AND NEW VERSION AND AN OCCASIONAL HYMN WHO KNEW THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF PROFANE HISTORY AND FOR WHOM THE MOTION AND SHAPE OF THE EARTH
1061-142358-0043 TO SPELL WITHOUT ANY OTHER MISTAKES THAN MUST IN FAIRNESS BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE UNREASONABLE CHARACTER OF ORTHOGRAPHY RATHER THAN TO ANY DEFICIENCY IN THE SPELLER AND MOREOVER TO LEARN HIS MUSICAL NOTES AND PART SINGING
1061-142358-0044 BESIDES ALL THIS HE HAD READ HIS BIBLE INCLUDING THE APOCRYPHAL BOOKS POOR RICHARD'S ALMANAC TAYLOR'S HOLY LIVING AND DYING THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS WITH BUNYAN'S LIFE AND HOLY WAR A GREAT DEAL OF BAILEY'S DICTIONARY VALENTINE AND ORSON
1061-142358-0045 AND PART OF A HISTORY OF BABYLON WHICH BARTLE MASSEY HAD LENT HIM HE MIGHT HAVE HAD MANY MORE BOOKS FROM BARTLE MASSEY BUT HE HAD NO TIME FOR READING THE COMMIN PRINT AS LISBETH CALLED IT SO BUSY AS HE WAS WITH FIGURES IN ALL THE LEISURE MOMENTS WHICH HE DID NOT FILL UP WITH EXTRA CARPENTRY
1061-142358-0046 ADAM YOU PERCEIVE WAS BY NO MEANS A MARVELLOUS MAN NOR PROPERLY SPEAKING A GENIUS YET I WILL NOT PRETEND THAT HIS WAS AN ORDINARY CHARACTER AMONG WORKMEN
1061-142358-0047 AND A PAPER CAP ON HIS HEAD HAS THE STRONG CONSCIENCE AND THE STRONG SENSE THE BLENDED SUSCEPTIBILITY AND SELF COMMAND OF OUR FRIEND ADAM HE WAS NOT AN AVERAGE MAN YET SUCH MEN AS HE ARE REARED HERE AND THERE IN EVERY GENERATION OF OUR PEASANT ARTISANS
1061-142358-0048 WITH AN INHERITANCE OF AFFECTIONS NURTURED BY A SIMPLE FAMILY LIFE OF COMMON NEED AND COMMON INDUSTRY AND AN INHERITANCE OF FACULTIES TRAINED IN SKILFUL COURAGEOUS LABOUR THEY MAKE THEIR WAY UPWARDS RARELY AS GENIUSES
1061-142358-0049 MOST COMMONLY AS PAINSTAKING HONEST MEN WITH THE SKILL AND CONSCIENCE TO DO WELL THE TASKS THAT LIE BEFORE THEM THEIR LIVES HAVE NO DISCERNIBLE ECHO BEYOND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE THEY DWELT BUT YOU ARE ALMOST SURE TO FIND THERE SOME GOOD PIECE OF ROAD SOME BUILDING
1061-142358-0050 SOME APPLICATION OF MINERAL PRODUCE SOME IMPROVEMENT IN FARMING PRACTICE SOME REFORM OF PARISH ABUSES WITH WHICH THEIR NAMES ARE ASSOCIATED BY ONE OR TWO GENERATIONS AFTER THEM THEIR EMPLOYERS WERE THE RICHER FOR THEM THE WORK OF THEIR HANDS HAS WORN WELL
1061-142358-0051 AND THE WORK OF THEIR BRAINS HAS GUIDED WELL THE HANDS OF OTHER MEN THEY WENT ABOUT IN THEIR YOUTH IN FLANNEL OR PAPER CAPS IN COATS BLACK WITH COAL DUST OR STREAKED WITH LIME AND RED PAINT IN OLD AGE THEIR WHITE HAIRS ARE SEEN IN A PLACE OF HONOUR AT CHURCH AND AT MARKET
