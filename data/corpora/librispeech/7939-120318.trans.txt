7939-120318-0014 HE STATED HIS CASE AND THE OTHER THREW UP HIS HANDS IN DESPAIR REALLY HE EXCLAIMED THIS IS TOO MUCH SAMUEL I CAN'T FIND EMPLOYMENT FOR EVERYONE IN LOCKMANVILLE
7939-120318-0015 I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THIS MAN WANTS TO LEAD A DECENT LIFE AND HE CAN'T BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY FOR HIM TO EARN A LIVING I UNDERSTAND ALL THAT SAMUEL
7939-120318-0016 BUT DOCTOR WHAT'S THE USE OF TRYING TO REFORM MEN IF THEY'RE CHAINED IN THAT WAY THERE WAS A PAUSE I'M AFRAID IT'S HOPELESS TO EXPLAIN TO YOU SAID THE CLERGYMAN
7939-120318-0017 BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO IT SAMUEL THERE ARE A GREAT MANY MEN IN THE WORLD WHO WANT JOBS
7939-120318-0018 YES SAID THE OTHER BUT THAT'S WHAT PROFESSOR STEWART TAUGHT MEN AND YOU SAID IT WAS WICKED OF HIM UM SAID THE DOCTOR TAKEN ABACK
7939-120318-0019 IF FINNEGAN WOULDN'T BE A BARKEEPER THEN HE AND HIS FAMILY WOULD STARVE AND SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD SURVIVE WHO WAS WILLING TO BE THAT BAD THE BOY WAITED DON'T YOU SEE THAT DOCTOR VINCE HE PERSISTED
7939-120318-0020 YES I SEE THAT SAID THE DOCTOR AND YOU TOLD ME THAT THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE FROM THAT WAS TO LIVE FOR OTHERS TO SERVE THEM AND HELP THEM AND ISN'T THAT WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO
7939-120318-0021 YES MY BOY THAT IS SO BUT WHAT CAN WE DO WHY DOCTOR AREN'T YOU THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH AND THE PEOPLE COME TO YOU TO BE TAUGHT YOU MUST POINT OUT THESE THINGS TO THEM SO THAT THERE CAN BE A CHANGE
7939-120318-0022 I DON'T KNOW SIR I'M GROPING AROUND AND TRYING TO FIND OUT BUT I'M SURE OF ONE THING THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE GOT TOO MUCH MONEY WHY DOCTOR VINCE THERE ARE PEOPLE RIGHT IN YOUR CHURCH
7939-120318-0023 WHO HAVE MORE THAN THEY COULD SPEND IN HUNDREDS OF YEARS PERHAPS SO SAID THE OTHER BUT WHAT HARM DOES THAT DO WHY THAT'S THE REASON THAT SO MANY OTHERS HAVE NOTHING ONLY REALIZE IT
7939-120318-0024 RIGHT AT THIS VERY MOMENT THERE ARE PEOPLE STARVING TO DEATH AND HERE IN LOCKMANVILLE THEY WANT TO WORK AND THERE IS NO WORK FOR THEM I COULD TAKE YOU TO SEE THEM SIR GIRLS WHO WANT A JOB IN MISTER WYGANT'S COTTON MILL
7939-120318-0025 THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO NEED GOOD CLOTHES LOOK AT POOR SOPHIE FOR INSTANCE
7939-120318-0026 BUT THEY HAVEN'T MONEY TO BUY THE CLOTH AND SAMUEL SAT FORWARD IN HIS EXCITEMENT YES YES HE CRIED AND ISN'T THAT JUST WHAT I SAID BEFORE THEY HAVE NO MONEY BECAUSE THE RICH PEOPLE HAVE IT ALL
7939-120318-0027 THERE WAS NO REPLY AND AFTER A MOMENT SAMUEL RUSHED ON SURELY IT IS SELFISH OF MISTER WYGANT TO SHUT POOR PEOPLE OUT OF HIS MILL JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO MONEY WHY COULDN'T HE LET THEM MAKE CLOTH FOR THEMSELVES
7939-120318-0028 LOOK AT WHAT'S WASTED IN A PLACE LIKE MASTER ALBERT'S AND THERE'S LAND ENOUGH AT FAIRVIEW TO RAISE FOOD FOR THE WHOLE TOWN
7939-120318-0029 AND IT'S USED TO KEEP A LOT OF RACE HORSES THAT NOBODY EVER RIDES SAMUEL SAID THE CLERGYMAN GRAVELY THAT IS TRUE AND THAT IS VERY WRONG BUT WHAT CAN I DO
7939-120318-0030 AND SAMUEL STARED AT HIM DOCTOR HE EXCLAIMED I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW IT HURTS ME TO HAVE YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT
7939-120318-0031 YOU TOLD ME THAT WE MUST SACRIFICE OURSELVES AND HELP OTHERS YOU SAID THAT WAS OUR SOLE DUTY AND I BELIEVED YOU I WAS READY TO GO WITH YOU AND HERE I AM I WANT TO FOLLOW YOU
7939-120318-0032 AND YOU WON'T LEAD THOSE WORDS WERE LIKE A STAB THE DOCTOR WINCED VISIBLY AND SAMUEL WINCED ALSO HIS HEART WAS WRUNG IT HURTS ME MORE THAN I CAN TELL YOU HE CRIED
7939-120318-0033 BUT THINK OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING NOBODY SPARES THEM AND HOW CAN YOU BE SILENT DOCTOR HOW CAN THE SHEPHERD OF CHRIST BE SILENT WHILE SOME OF HIS FLOCK ARE LIVING IN LUXURY AND OTHERS ARE STARVING TO DEATH
7939-120318-0034 THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE DOCTOR VINCE SAT RIGID CLUTCHING THE ARMS OF HIS CHAIR
7939-120318-0035 YOU ARE RIGHT I WILL PREACH ON THIS UNEMPLOYED QUESTION NEXT SUNDAY AH THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU EXCLAIMED SAMUEL WITH TEARS OF GRATITUDE IN HIS EYES
7939-120318-0036 AND HE TOOK HIS FRIEND'S HAND AND WRUNG IT THEN SUDDENLY A NEW THOUGHT CAME TO HIM
