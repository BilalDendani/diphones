636-128331-0014 THAT WAS WELL DONE LET HIM EAT IT NOW MADAME PUT HER KNIFE UNDER HER ARM AND CLAPPED HER HANDS AS AT A PLAY THE PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY BEHIND MADAME DEFARGE EXPLAINING THE CAUSE OF HER SATISFACTION TO THOSE BEHIND THEM
636-128331-0015 WITH MARVELLOUS QUICKNESS AT A DISTANCE THE MORE READILY BECAUSE CERTAIN MEN WHO HAD BY SOME WONDERFUL EXERCISE OF AGILITY CLIMBED UP THE EXTERNAL ARCHITECTURE TO LOOK IN FROM THE WINDOWS KNEW MADAME DEFARGE WELL AND ACTED AS A TELEGRAPH BETWEEN HER AND THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE BUILDING
636-128331-0016 DIRECTLY DOWN UPON THE OLD PRISONER'S HEAD THE FAVOUR WAS TOO MUCH TO BEAR IN AN INSTANT THE BARRIER OF DUST AND CHAFF THAT HAD STOOD SURPRISINGLY LONG WENT TO THE WINDS AND SAINT ANTOINE HAD GOT HIM

636-128331-0021 AND SILENTLY AND COMPOSEDLY LOOKED AT HIM WHILE THEY MADE READY AND WHILE HE BESOUGHT HER THE WOMEN PASSIONATELY SCREECHING AT HIM ALL THE TIME AND THE MEN STERNLY CALLING OUT TO HAVE HIM KILLED WITH GRASS IN HIS MOUTH
636-128331-0022 ONCE HE WENT ALOFT AND THE ROPE BROKE AND THEY CAUGHT HIM SHRIEKING TWICE HE WENT ALOFT AND THE ROPE BROKE AND THEY CAUGHT HIM SHRIEKING THEN THE ROPE WAS MERCIFUL AND HELD HIM AND HIS HEAD WAS SOON UPON A PIKE
636-128331-0023 SET HIS HEAD AND HEART ON PIKES AND CARRIED THE THREE SPOILS OF THE DAY IN WOLF PROCESSION THROUGH THE STREETS
636-128331-0024 AND ACHIEVING THEM AGAIN IN GOSSIP GRADUALLY THESE STRINGS OF RAGGED PEOPLE SHORTENED AND FRAYED AWAY AND THEN POOR LIGHTS BEGAN TO SHINE IN HIGH WINDOWS AND SLENDER FIRES WERE MADE IN THE STREETS AT WHICH NEIGHBOURS COOKED IN COMMON
636-128331-0025 AFTERWARDS SUPPING AT THEIR DOORS SCANTY AND INSUFFICIENT SUPPERS THOSE AND INNOCENT OF MEAT AS OF MOST OTHER SAUCE TO WRETCHED BREAD YET HUMAN FELLOWSHIP INFUSED SOME NOURISHMENT INTO THE FLINTY VIANDS
636-128331-0026 AND STRUCK SOME SPARKS OF CHEERFULNESS OUT OF THEM FATHERS AND MOTHERS WHO HAD HAD THEIR FULL SHARE IN THE WORST OF THE DAY PLAYED GENTLY WITH THEIR MEAGRE CHILDREN AND LOVERS WITH SUCH A WORLD AROUND THEM AND BEFORE THEM LOVED AND HOPED
636-128331-0027 EH WELL RETURNED MADAME ALMOST SAINT ANTOINE SLEPT THE DEFARGES SLEPT EVEN THE VENGEANCE SLEPT WITH HER STARVED GROCER
