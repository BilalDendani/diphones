3330-172156-0000 WHO HURRIED HIM TO THE BAPTISMAL FOUNT AND SO SAVED HIM FROM SHARING THE LOT OF HIS FATHER THOUGH HE RETAINED MANY MARKS OF HIS UNEARTHLY ORIGIN AT THIS TIME VORTIGERN REIGNED IN BRITAIN
3330-172156-0001 HE WAS A USURPER WHO HAD CAUSED THE DEATH OF HIS SOVEREIGN MOINES AND DRIVEN THE TWO BROTHERS OF THE LATE KING WHOSE NAMES WERE UTHER AND PENDRAGON INTO BANISHMENT VORTIGERN
3330-172156-0002 WHO LIVED IN CONSTANT FEAR OF THE RETURN OF THE RIGHTFUL HEIRS OF THE KINGDOM BEGAN TO ERECT A STRONG TOWER FOR DEFENCE THE EDIFICE WHEN BROUGHT BY THE WORKMEN TO A CERTAIN HEIGHT THREE TIMES FELL TO THE GROUND WITHOUT ANY APPARENT CAUSE
3330-172156-0003 THE KING CONSULTED HIS ASTROLOGERS ON THIS WONDERFUL EVENT AND LEARNED FROM THEM THAT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO BATHE THE CORNER STONE OF THE FOUNDATION WITH THE BLOOD OF A CHILD BORN WITHOUT A MORTAL FATHER
3330-172156-0004 IN SEARCH OF SUCH AN INFANT VORTIGERN SENT HIS MESSENGERS ALL OVER THE KINGDOM AND THEY BY ACCIDENT DISCOVERED MERLIN WHOSE LINEAGE SEEMED TO POINT HIM OUT AS THE INDIVIDUAL WANTED THEY TOOK HIM TO THE KING BUT MERLIN
3330-172156-0005 YOUNG AS HE WAS EXPLAINED TO THE KING THE ABSURDITY OF ATTEMPTING TO RESCUE THE FABRIC BY SUCH MEANS FOR HE TOLD HIM THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE INSTABILITY OF THE TOWER WAS ITS BEING PLACED OVER THE DEN OF TWO IMMENSE DRAGONS
3330-172156-0006 WHOSE COMBATS SHOOK THE EARTH ABOVE THEM THE KING ORDERED HIS WORKMEN TO DIG BENEATH THE TOWER AND WHEN THEY HAD DONE SO THEY DISCOVERED TWO ENORMOUS SERPENTS THE ONE WHITE AS MILK THE OTHER RED AS FIRE
3330-172156-0007 THE MULTITUDE LOOKED ON WITH AMAZEMENT TILL THE SERPENTS SLOWLY RISING FROM THEIR DEN AND EXPANDING THEIR ENORMOUS FOLDS BEGAN THE COMBAT WHEN EVERY ONE FLED IN TERROR EXCEPT MERLIN
3330-172156-0008 WHO STOOD BY CLAPPING HIS HANDS AND CHEERING ON THE CONFLICT THE RED DRAGON WAS SLAIN AND THE WHITE ONE GLIDING THROUGH A CLEFT IN THE ROCK DISAPPEARED THESE ANIMALS TYPIFIED AS MERLIN AFTERWARDS EXPLAINED
3330-172156-0009 THE INVASION OF UTHER AND PENDRAGON THE RIGHTFUL PRINCES WHO SOON AFTER LANDED WITH A GREAT ARMY VORTIGERN WAS DEFEATED AND AFTERWARDS BURNED ALIVE IN THE CASTLE HE HAD TAKEN SUCH PAINS TO CONSTRUCT
3330-172156-0010 ON THE DEATH OF VORTIGERN PENDRAGON ASCENDED THE THRONE MERLIN BECAME HIS CHIEF ADVISER AND OFTEN ASSISTED THE KING BY HIS MAGICAL ARTS MERLIN WHO KNEW THE RANGE OF ALL THEIR ARTS
3330-172156-0011 HAD BUILT THE KING HIS HAVENS SHIPS AND HALLS VIVIAN AMONG OTHER ENDOWMENTS HE HAD THE POWER OF TRANSFORMING HIMSELF INTO ANY SHAPE HE PLEASED AT ONE TIME HE APPEARED AS A DWARF
3330-172156-0012 AT OTHERS AS A DAMSEL A PAGE OR EVEN A GREYHOUND OR A STAG THIS FACULTY HE OFTEN EMPLOYED FOR THE SERVICE OF THE KING AND SOMETIMES ALSO FOR THE DIVERSION OF THE COURT AND THE SOVEREIGN
3330-172156-0013 MERLIN CONTINUED TO BE A FAVORITE COUNSELLOR THROUGH THE REIGNS OF PENDRAGON UTHER AND ARTHUR AND AT LAST DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW AND WAS NO MORE FOUND AMONG MEN
3330-172156-0014 THROUGH THE TREACHERY OF HIS MISTRESS VIVIANE THE FAIRY WHICH HAPPENED IN THIS WISE MERLIN HAVING BECOME ENAMOURED OF THE FAIR VIVIANE THE LADY OF THE LAKE WAS WEAK ENOUGH TO IMPART TO HER VARIOUS IMPORTANT SECRETS OF HIS ART
3330-172156-0015 BEING IMPELLED BY FATAL DESTINY OF WHICH HE WAS AT THE SAME TIME FULLY AWARE THE LADY HOWEVER WAS NOT CONTENT WITH HIS DEVOTION UNBOUNDED AS IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN
3330-172156-0016 BUT CAST ABOUT THE ROMANCE TELLS US HOW SHE MIGHT DETAIN HIM FOR EVERMORE AND ONE DAY ADDRESSED HIM IN THESE TERMS SIR I WOULD THAT WE SHOULD MAKE A FAIR PLACE AND A SUITABLE
3330-172156-0017 SO CONTRIVED BY ART AND BY CUNNING THAT IT MIGHT NEVER BE UNDONE AND THAT YOU AND I SHOULD BE THERE IN JOY AND SOLACE MY LADY SAID MERLIN I WILL DO ALL THIS
3330-172156-0018 AND I WILL DO IT AND THEN IT WILL BE MORE TO MY MIND I GRANT YOU THIS SAID MERLIN THEN HE BEGAN TO DEVISE AND THE DAMSEL PUT IT ALL IN WRITING AND WHEN HE HAD DEVISED THE WHOLE
3330-172156-0019 THEN HAD THE DAMSEL FULL GREAT JOY AND SHOWED HIM GREATER SEMBLANCE OF LOVE THAN SHE HAD EVER BEFORE MADE AND THEY SOJOURNED TOGETHER A LONG WHILE
3330-172156-0020 AT LENGTH IT FELL OUT THAT AS THEY WERE GOING ONE DAY HAND IN HAND THROUGH THE FOREST OF BRECELIANDE THEY FOUND A BUSH OF WHITE THORN WHICH WAS LADEN WITH FLOWERS AND THEY SEATED THEMSELVES UNDER THE SHADE OF THIS WHITE THORN
3330-172156-0021 UPON THE GREEN GRASS AND MERLIN LAID HIS HEAD UPON THE DAMSEL'S LAP AND FELL ASLEEP THEN THE DAMSEL ROSE AND MADE A RING WITH HER WIMPLE ROUND THE BUSH AND ROUND MERLIN AND BEGAN HER ENCHANTMENTS SUCH AS HE HIMSELF HAD TAUGHT HER
3330-172156-0022 AND NINE TIMES SHE MADE THE RING AND NINE TIMES SHE MADE THE ENCHANTMENT AND THEN SHE WENT AND SAT DOWN BY HIM AND PLACED HIS HEAD AGAIN UPON HER LAP AND A SLEEP FELL UPON MERLIN MORE LIKE DEATH
3330-172156-0023 THEN VIVIAN ROSE AND FROM HER BROWN LOCKED HEAD THE WIMPLE THROWS AND TAKES IT IN HER HAND AND WAVES IT OVER THE BLOSSOMED THORN TREE AND HER SLEEPING LOVER
3330-172156-0024 NINE TIMES SHE WAVED THE FLUTTERING WIMPLE ROUND AND MADE A LITTLE PLOT OF MAGIC GROUND
3330-172156-0025 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS ENCLOSED IN THE STRONGEST TOWER IN THE WORLD AND LAID UPON A FAIR BED
3330-172156-0026 MY LADY YOU HAVE DECEIVED ME UNLESS YOU ABIDE WITH ME FOR NO ONE HATH POWER TO UNMAKE THIS TOWER BUT YOU ALONE
3330-172156-0027 AND IN THIS SHE HELD HER COVENANT WITH HIM AND MERLIN NEVER WENT OUT OF THAT TOWER WHERE HIS MISTRESS VIVIANE HAD ENCLOSED HIM BUT SHE ENTERED AND WENT OUT AGAIN WHEN SHE LISTED
3330-172156-0028 AFTER THIS EVENT MERLIN WAS NEVER MORE KNOWN TO HOLD CONVERSE WITH ANY MORTAL BUT VIVIANE EXCEPT ON ONE OCCASION ARTHUR HAVING FOR SOME TIME MISSED HIM FROM HIS COURT
3330-172156-0029 WHO MET WITH A VERY UNPLEASANT ADVENTURE WHILE ENGAGED IN THIS QUEST
3330-172156-0030 WHEN SUDDENLY HE HEARD THE VOICE OF ONE GROANING ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND LOOKING THAT WAY HE COULD SEE NOTHING SAVE A KIND OF SMOKE WHICH SEEMED LIKE AIR AND THROUGH WHICH HE COULD NOT PASS
3330-172156-0031 BY WHAT MISADVENTURE HE WAS IMPRISONED THERE AH SIR HE ADDED YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME MORE AND THAT GRIEVES ME BUT I CANNOT REMEDY IT I SHALL NEVER MORE SPEAK TO YOU NOR TO ANY OTHER PERSON SAVE ONLY MY MISTRESS
3330-172156-0032 BUT DO THOU HASTEN TO KING ARTHUR AND CHARGE HIM FROM ME TO UNDERTAKE WITHOUT DELAY THE QUEST OF THE SACRED GRAAL THE KNIGHT IS ALREADY BORN AND HAS RECEIVED KNIGHTHOOD AT HIS HANDS
3330-172156-0033 ASSURING HIM THAT HE SHOULD SPEEDILY BE DISENCHANTED AND HE PREDICTED TO HIM
3330-172156-0034 BUT IT IS CHIEFLY ON GREAT OCCASIONS AND AT A PERIOD SUBSEQUENT TO HIS DEATH OR MAGICAL DISAPPEARANCE IN THE ROMANTIC POEMS OF ITALY AND IN SPENSER MERLIN IS CHIEFLY REPRESENTED AS A MAGICAL ARTIST
3330-172156-0035 SPENSER REPRESENTS HIM AS THE ARTIFICER OF THE IMPENETRABLE SHIELD AND OTHER ARMOR OF PRINCE ARTHUR
3330-172156-0036 AND OF A MIRROR IN WHICH A DAMSEL VIEWED HER LOVER'S SHADE THE FOUNTAIN OF LOVE IN THE ORLANDO INNAMORATA IS DESCRIBED AS HIS WORK AND IN THE POEM OF ARIOSTO
3330-172156-0037 WE ARE TOLD OF A HALL ADORNED WITH PROPHETIC PAINTINGS WHICH DEMONS HAD EXECUTED IN A SINGLE NIGHT UNDER THE DIRECTION OF MERLIN THE FOLLOWING LEGEND IS FROM SPENSER'S FAERY QUEENE BOOK THREE
3330-172156-0038 OR CAERMARTHEN IN WALES MERLIN'S TOWER AND THE IMPRISONED FIENDS FORTHWITH THEMSELVES
3330-172156-0039 THAT NONE MIGHT THEM BEWRAY
3330-172156-0040 THEY TOOK THEIR WAY THERE THE WISE MERLIN WHYLOME WONT THEY SAY
3330-172156-0041 LOW UNDERNEATH THE GROUND
3330-172156-0042 THAT OF NO LIVING WIGHT HE MOTE BE FOUND WHENSO HE COUNSELLED WITH HIS SPRIGHTS ENCOMPASSED ROUND AND IF THOU EVER HAPPEN THAT SAME WAY TO TRAVEL GO TO SEE THAT DREADFUL PLACE IT IS A HIDEOUS HOLLOW CAVE THEY SAY
3330-172156-0043 BUT DARE NOT THOU I CHARGE IN ANY CASE TO ENTER INTO THAT SAME BALEFUL BOWER FOR FEAR THE CRUEL FIENDS SHOULD THEE UNWARES DEVOUR BUT STANDING HIGH ALOFT LOW LAY THINE EAR
3330-172156-0044 AND THERE SUCH GHASTLY NOISE OF IRON CHAINS AND BRAZEN CAULDRONS THOU SHALT RUMBLING HEAR WHICH THOUSAND SPRITES WITH LONG ENDURING PAINS DO TOSS THAT IT WILL STUN THY FEEBLE BRAINS
3330-172156-0045 AND OFTENTIMES LOUD STROKES AND RINGING SOUNDS FROM UNDER THAT DEEP ROCK MOST HORRIBLY REBOUNDS THE CAUSE SOME SAY IS THIS A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE THAT MERLIN DIED
3330-172156-0046 HE DID INTEND A BRAZEN WALL IN COMPAS TO COMPILE ABOUT CAERMERDIN AND DID IT COMMEND UNTO THESE SPRITES TO BRING TO PERFECT END DURING WHICH WORK THE LADY OF THE LAKE
3330-172156-0047 WHOM LONG HE LOVED FOR HIM IN HASTE DID SEND WHO THEREBY FORCED HIS WORKMEN TO FORSAKE THEM BOUND TILL HIS RETURN THEIR LABOR NOT TO SLACK
3330-172156-0048 IN THE MEAN TIME THROUGH THAT FALSE LADY'S TRAIN HE WAS SURPRISED AND BURIED UNDER BEARE HE EVER TO HIS WORK RETURNED AGAIN NATHLESS THOSE FIENDS MAY NOT THEIR WORK FORBEAR SO GREATLY HIS COMMANDEMENT THEY FEAR
3330-172156-0049 BUT THERE DO TOIL AND TRAVAIL DAY AND NIGHT UNTIL THAT BRAZEN WALL THEY UP DO REAR FOR MERLIN HAD IN MAGIC MORE INSIGHT THAN EVER HIM BEFORE OR AFTER LIVING WIGHT FOOTNOTE BURIED UNDER BEARE
