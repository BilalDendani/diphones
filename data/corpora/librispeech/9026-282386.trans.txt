9026-282386-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT THE CARIBOO ROAD WHEN THE RAILWAY FIRST WENT THROUGH THE FRASER CANYON PASSENGERS LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOWS ANYWHERE FROM YALE TO ASHCROFT WERE AMAZED TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE A JACOB'S LADDER UP AND DOWN THE MOUNTAINS
9026-282386-0001 APPEARING IN PLACES TO HANG ALMOST IN MID AIR BETWEEN YALE AND LYTTON IT HUGGED THE MOUNTAIN SIDE ON WHAT LOOKED LIKE A SHELF OF ROCK DIRECTLY ABOVE THE WILDEST WATER OF THE CANYON CRIB WORK OF HUGE TREES RESEMBLING IN THE DISTANCE THE WOVEN PATTERN OF A WILLOW BASKET
9026-282386-0002 THE TRAVELLER ALMOST EXPECTED TO SEE THE THING SWAY AND SWING TO THE WIND THEN THE TRAIN WOULD SWEEP THROUGH A TUNNEL OR SWING ROUND A SHARP BEND AND FAR UP AMONG THE SUMMITS MIGHT BE SEEN A MULE TEAM OR A STRING OF PACK HORSES WINDING ROUND THE SHOULDERS OF THE ROCK
9026-282386-0003 AND FOLLOW A TRAIL APPARENTLY SECURE ONLY FOR A MOUNTAIN GOAT THE FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THE THING MUST BE AN OLD INDIAN WAR PATH ALONG WHICH NO ENEMY COULD PURSUE BUT WHEN THE TRAIN PAUSED AT A WATER TANK AND THE TRAVELLER MADE INQUIRY HE WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS NOTHING LESS
9026-282386-0004 WITH CARE CREEP UP FROM LANGLEY TO HOPE AND YALE AND THE FARES CHARGED AFFORDED A GOOD REVENUE TO THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY EVEN WHEN PROSPECTORS STRUCK ABOVE YALE
9026-282386-0005 OR FROM THE OKANAGAN TO THE THOMPSON THE DIFFICULTIES OF TRANSPORTATION WERE SOON SURMOUNTED A ROAD WAS SHORTLY OPENED FROM HARRISON LAKE TO LILLOOET
9026-282386-0006 AND AS TO THE THOMPSON THERE WAS THE WELL WORN TRAIL OF THE FUR TRADERS WHO HAD BEEN GOING OVERLAND TO KAMLOOPS FOR FIFTY YEARS IT WAS WHEN GOLD WAS DISCOVERED HIGHER UP ON THE FRASER AND IN CARIBOO
9026-282386-0007 AFTER THE COLONY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA HAD TAKEN ITS PLACE ON THE POLITICAL MAP THAT GOVERNOR DOUGLAS WAS PUT TO THE TASK OF BUILDING A GREAT ROAD HENCEFORTH FOR A FEW YEARS AT LEAST THE MINERS WOULD BE THE BACKBONE IF NOT THE WHOLE BODY OF THE NEW COLONY
9026-282386-0008 HOW COULD THE ADMINISTRATION BE CARRIED ON IF THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO ROAD INTO THE MINING REGION AND SO THE GOVERNOR OF BRITISH COLUMBIA ENTERED ON THE BOLDEST UNDERTAKING IN ROADBUILDING EVER LAUNCHED BY ANY COMMUNITY OF TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE
9026-282386-0009 THE CARIBOO ROAD BECAME TO BRITISH COLUMBIA WHAT THE APPIAN WAY WAS TO ROME IT WAS EIGHTEEN FEET WIDE AND OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILES LONG IT WAS ONE OF THE FINEST ROADS EVER BUILT IN THE WORLD
9026-282386-0010 YET IT COST THE COUNTRY ONLY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MILE AS AGAINST THE FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A MILE WHICH THE TWO TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAYS SPENT LATER ON THEIR ROADBEDS ALONG THE CANYON
9026-282386-0011 AND WHEN THE ROAD WAS OPENED IN SEPTEMBER PACKERS CHARGES FELL FROM A DOLLAR TO FORTY EIGHT CENTS AND FINALLY TO EIGHTEEN CENTS A POUND BUT PRESENTLY THE TREND OF TRAVEL DREW AWAY FROM HARRISON LAKE TO THE LINE OF THE FRASER
9026-282386-0012 AT FIRST THERE WAS NOTHING BUT A MULE TRAIL HACKED OUT OF THE ROCK FROM YALE TO SPUZZUM BUT MINERS WENT VOLUNTARILY TO WORK AND WIDENED THE BRIDLE PATH ABOVE THE SHELVING WATERS FROM SPUZZUM TO LYTTON
9026-282386-0013 THE RIVER LEDGES SEEMED ALMOST IMPASSABLE FOR PACK ANIMALS YET A CABLE FERRY WAS RIGGED UP AT SPUZZUM AND MULES WERE SENT OVER THE LEDGES TO DRAW IT UP THE RIVER WHEN THE WATER ROSE SO HIGH THAT THE LOWER LEDGES WERE UNSAFE
9026-282386-0014 THE PACKERS ASCENDED THE MOUNTAINS EIGHT HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE ROARING CANYON WHERE CLIFFS BROKE OFF THEY SENT THE ANIMALS ACROSS AN INDIAN BRIDGE THE MARVEL IS NOT THAT MANY A POOR BEAST FELL HEADLONG EIGHT HUNDRED FEET DOWN THE PRECIPICE
9026-282386-0015 DRAWN BY SIX HORSES ROAD HOUSES ALONG THE WAY PROVIDED RELAYS OF FRESH HORSES FREIGHT WENT IN BY BULL TEAM BUT PACK HORSES AND MULES WERE STILL USED TO CARRY MINERS PROVISIONS TO THE CAMPS IN THE HILLS WHICH LAY OFF THE MAIN ROAD
9026-282386-0016 IT WAS WHILE THE ROAD WAS STILL BUILDING THAT AN ENTERPRISING PACKER BROUGHT TWENTY ONE CAMELS ON THE TRAIL THEY WERE NOT A SUCCESS AND CAUSED COUNTLESS STAMPEDES HORSES AND MULES TOOK FRIGHT AT THE SLIGHTEST WHIFF OF THEM
9026-282386-0017 THE CAMELS THEMSELVES COULD STAND NEITHER THE CLIMATE NOR THE HARD ROCK ROAD THEY WERE TURNED ADRIFT ON THE THOMPSON RIVER WHERE THE LAST OF THEM DIED IN NINETEEN O FIVE THERE WAS SOMETHING HIGHLY ROMANTIC IN THE STAGE COACH TRAVEL OF THIS HALCYON ERA
9026-282386-0018 THE DRIVER WAS ALWAYS A CRACK WHIP A MAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF AN OLD TIMER THOUGH OFTEN HIS YEARS NUMBERED FEWER THAN TWENTY MOST OF THE DRIVERS HOWEVER KNEW THE TRAIL FROM HAVING PACKED IN ON SHANKS'S MARE AND CAMPED UNDER THE STARS
9026-282386-0019 ON THE DOWN TRIP BAGS WERE PILED ON THE ROOF WITH A COUPLE OF FRONTIERSMEN ARMED WITH RIFLES TO GUARD THEM MANY WERE THE DEVICES OF A RETURNING MINER FOR CONCEALING THE GOLD WHICH HE HAD WON A FAT HURDY GURDY GIRL OR SOMETIMES A SQUAW WOULD CLIMB TO A PLACE IN THE STAGE
9026-282386-0020 AND WHEN THE STAGE WITH A CRACK OF THE WHIP AND A PRANCE OF THE SIX HORSES CAME RATTLING ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND ROLLING INTO YALE THE FAT GIRL WOULD BE THE FIRST TO DEPOSIT HER AMPLE PERSON AT THE BANK OR THE EXPRESS OFFICE WHENCE GOLD COULD SAFELY BE SENT ON DOWN TO VICTORIA
9026-282386-0021 AND WHEN SHE EMERGED HALF AN HOUR LATER SHE WOULD HAVE THINNED PERCEPTIBLY THEN THE ROUGH MINER WHO HAD NOT ADDRESSED A WORD TO HER ON THE WAY DOWN FOR FEAR OF A CONFIDENCE MAN ABOARD WOULD PRESENT SUSY WITH A HANDSOME REWARD IN THE FORM OF A GAUDY DRESS OR A YEAR'S PROVISIONS
9026-282386-0022 START FROM A ROAD HOUSE WAS MADE AT DAWN WHEN THE CLOUDS STILL HUNG HEAVY ON THE MOUNTAINS AND THE PEAKS WERE ALL REFLECTED IN THE GLACIAL WATERS THE PASSENGERS TUMBLED DISHEVELLED FROM LOG WALLED ROOMS WHERE THE BEDS WERE BENCH BERTHS
9026-282386-0023 THE FARE CONSISTED OF HAM FRIED IN SLABS EGGS ANCIENT AND TRANSFORMED TO LEATHER IN LARD SLAPJACKS KNOWN AS ROCKY MOUNTAIN DEAD SHOT IN MAPLE SYRUP THAT NEVER SAW A MAPLE TREE AND WAS BLACK AS A POT AND POTATOES IN SOGGY PYRAMIDS
9026-282386-0024 YET SO KEEN WAS THE MOUNTAIN AIR SO STIMULATING THE OZONE OF THE RESINOUS HEMLOCK FORESTS THAT THE MOST FASTIDIOUS TRAVELLER FELT HE HAD FARED SUMPTUOUSLY AND GAILY PAID THE TWO FIFTY FOR THE MEAL
9026-282386-0025 PERHAPS THERE WAS TIME TO WASH IN THE COMMON TIN BASIN AT THE DOOR WHERE THE TOWEL ALWAYS BORE EVIDENCE OF PATRONAGE PERHAPS NOT ANYHOW NO MATTER WASHING WAS ONLY A TRIVIAL INCIDENT OF MOUNTAIN TRAVEL IN THOSE DAYS
9026-282386-0026 THE PASSENGER JUMPED FOR A PLACE IN THE COACH THE LONG WHIP CRACKED THE HORSES SPRANG FORWARD AND AWAY THE STAGE RATTLED ROUND CURVES WHERE A HIND WHEEL WOULD TRY TO GO OVER THE EDGE ONLY THE DRIVER DIDN'T LET IT DOWN EMBANKMENTS WHERE ANY NORMAL WAGON WOULD HAVE UPSET
9026-282386-0027 BUT THIS ONE DIDN'T UP SHARP GRADES WHERE NO HORSES OUGHT TO BE DRIVEN AT A TROT BUT WHERE THE SIX PERSISTED IN GOING AT A GALLOP THE PASSENGER DIDN'T MIND THE JOLTING THAT ALMOST DISLOCATED HIS SPINE
9026-282386-0028 HE WAS THANKFUL NOT TO BE HELD UP BY HIGHWAYMEN OR DUMPED INTO THE WILD CATARACT OF WATERS BELOW OUTSIDE WAS A CHANGING PANORAMA OF MOUNTAIN AND CANYON WITH A WORLD OF FORESTS AND LAKES
9026-282386-0029 INSIDE WAS A DRAMA OF HUMAN NATURE TO OUTDO ANY CURTAIN RAISER HE HAD EVER WITNESSED A BARONET WHO HAD LOST IN THE GAME AND WAS GOING HOME PENNILESS PERHAPS EARNING HIS WAY BY HELPING WITH THE HORSES AN OUTWORN ACTRESS WHO HAD BEEN TRYING HER LUCK AT THE DANCE HALLS
9026-282386-0030 A GAMBLER PRETENDING THAT HE WAS A MILLIONAIRE A SALOON KEEPER WITH A FEW THOUSANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND A DIAMOND IN HIS SHIRT THE SIZE OF A PEBBLE A TENDERFOOT RIGGED OUT AS A VETERAN WITH BUCKSKIN COAT A BELT FULL OF ARTILLERY
9026-282386-0031 FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE NEW HIGH BOOTS AND A DEVIL MAY CARE AIR THAT DECEIVED NO ONE BUT HIMSELF A FEW SHUSWAPS AND SIWASHES FAT ILL SMELLING INSOLENT AND PLAINLY HIGHLY AMUSED
9026-282386-0032 IN THEIR BEADY WATCHFUL BLACK FERRET EYES AT THE MAD WAYS OF THIS WHITE RACE A STILL MORE ILL SMELLING CHINAMAN AND A TACITURN GRIZZLED RAGGED FELLOW PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE FAT SQUAW KEEPING HIS OBSERVATIONS AND HIS THOUGHTS INSIDE HIS HIGH BOOTS
9026-282386-0033 OR THE EXPRESS OFFICE AT YALE IF ONE COULD GET A SEAT OUTSIDE WITH THE GUARDS AND THE DRIVER ONE WHO KNEW HOW TO UNLOCK THE LORE OF THESE SONS OF THE HILLS HE WAS LUCKY FOR HE WOULD LEARN WHO MADE HIS STRIKE THERE WHO WAS MURDERED AT ANOTHER PLACE
9026-282386-0034 HOW THE SNEAK THIEF TRAILED THE TENDERFOOT SOMEWHERE ELSE ALL OF IT ROMANCE MUCH OF IT FICTION MUCH OF IT FACT BUT NO FICTION HALF SO MARVELLOUS AS THE FACT BULL TEAMS OF TWENTY YOKES
9026-282386-0035 LONG LINES OF PACK HORSES LED BY A BELL MARE MULE TEAMS WITH A TINKLING OF BELLS AND SINGING OF THE DRIVERS MET THE STAGE AND PASSED WITH HAPPY SALUTE AT NIGHTFALL THE CAMP FIRES OF FOOT TRAVELLERS COULD BE SEEN DOWN AT THE WATER'S EDGE
9026-282386-0036 AND THERE WAS ALWAYS DANGER ENOUGH TO ADD ZEST TO THE JOURNEY WHEREVER THERE ARE HORDES OF HUNGRY ADVENTUROUS MEN THERE WILL BE DESPERADOES IN SPITE OF BEGBIE'S JUSTICE ROBBERIES OCCURRED ON THE ROAD AND NOT A FEW MURDERS
9026-282386-0037 THE TIME GOING IN AND OUT VARIED BUT THE JOURNEY COULD BE MADE IN FIVE DAYS AND WAS OFTEN MADE IN FOUR THE BUILDING OF THE CARIBOO ROAD HAD AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON THE CAMP THAT ITS BUILDERS COULD NOT FORESEE
9026-282386-0038 BEFORE THE ROAD WAS BUILT ADVENTURERS HAD ARRIVED IN CARIBOO EXPECTING TO PICK UP PAILS OF NUGGETS AT THE BOTTOM OF A RAINBOW THEIR DISILLUSIONMENT CAME BUT THERE WAS AN EASY WAY BACK TO THE WORLD THEY DID NOT STAY TO BREED CRIME AND LAWLESSNESS IN THE CAMP
9026-282386-0039 THE WALKING' AS BEGBIE EXPRESSED IT
9026-282386-0040 AND THE ROAD WAS GOOD ESPECIALLY FOR THUGS WHILE THERE WERE TEN THOUSAND MEN IN CARIBOO IN THE WINTER OF SIXTY TWO AND PERHAPS TWENTY THOUSAND IN THE WINTER OF SIXTY THREE THERE WERE LESS THAN FIVE THOUSAND IN SEVENTY ONE THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE CAMP HAD COLLAPSED
9026-282386-0041 IT HAD SIMPLY CHANGED FROM A POOR MAN'S CAMP TO A CAMP FOR A CAPITALIST OR A COMPANY IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT THE MINERS FIRST FOUND THE GOLD IN FLAKES THEN FARTHER UP IN NUGGETS THEN THAT THE NUGGETS HAD TO BE PURSUED TO PAY DIRT BENEATH GRAVEL AND CLAY
9026-282386-0042 THIS MEANT SHAFTS TUNNELS HYDRAULIC MACHINERY STAMP MILLS LATER WHEN THE PAY DIRT SHOWED SIGNS OF MERGING INTO QUARTZ THERE PASSED AWAY FOR EVER THE DAY OF THE PENNILESS PROSPECTOR
9026-282386-0043 SEEKING THE GOLDEN FLEECE OF THE HILLS AS HIS PREDECESSOR THE TRAPPER HAD SOUGHT THE PELT OF THE LITTLE BEAVER
9026-282386-0044 AN INSTRUMENT FOR SHAPING EMPIRE FOR IT WAS THE INRUSH OF MINERS WHICH GAVE BIRTH TO THE COLONY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA FEDERATION WITH THE CANADIAN DOMINION FOLLOWED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE
