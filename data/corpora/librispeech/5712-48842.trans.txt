5712-48842-0000 LILY HAD EXACTED A PROMISE FROM HER MOTHER BEFORE HER ILLNESS AND DURING THE PERIOD OF HER CONVALESCENCE OFTEN REFERRED TO IT REMINDING HER MOTHER THAT THAT PROMISE HAD BEEN MADE AND MUST BE KEPT
5712-48842-0001 LILY WAS TO BE TOLD THE DAY ON WHICH CROSBIE WAS TO BE MARRIED IT HAD COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEM ALL THAT THE MARRIAGE WAS TO TAKE PLACE IN FEBRUARY BUT THIS WAS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR LILY SHE MUST KNOW THE DAY AND AS THE TIME DREW NEARER
5712-48842-0002 THE MARRIAGE OF CROSBIE AND ALEXANDRINA WAS SPOKEN OF MUCH MORE FREQUENTLY AT THE SMALL HOUSE IT WAS NOT A SUBJECT WHICH MISSUS DALE OR BELL WOULD HAVE CHOSEN FOR CONVERSATION BUT LILY WOULD REFER TO IT
5712-48842-0003 SHE WOULD BEGIN BY DOING SO ALMOST IN A DROLLING STRAIN ALLUDING TO HERSELF AS A FORLORN DAMSEL IN A PLAY BOOK AND THEN SHE WOULD GO ON TO SPEAK OF HIS INTERESTS AS A MATTER WHICH WAS STILL OF GREAT MOMENT TO HER
5712-48842-0004 BUT IN THE COURSE OF SUCH TALKING SHE WOULD TOO OFTEN BREAK DOWN SHOWING BY SOME SAD WORD OR MELANCHOLY TONE HOW GREAT WAS THE BURDEN ON HER HEART MISSUS DALE AND BELL WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE AVOIDED THE SUBJECT
5712-48842-0005 BUT LILY WOULD NOT HAVE IT AVOIDED FOR THEM IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT MATTER ON WHICH TO SPEAK IN HER HEARING IT WAS NOT PERMITTED TO THEM TO SAY A WORD OF ABUSE AGAINST CROSBIE AS TO WHOM THEY THOUGHT THAT NO WORD OF CONDEMNATION COULD BE SUFFICIENTLY SEVERE
5712-48842-0006 AND THEY WERE FORCED TO LISTEN TO SUCH EXCUSES FOR HIS CONDUCT AS LILY CHOSE TO MANUFACTURE NEVER DARING TO POINT OUT HOW VAIN THOSE EXCUSES WERE INDEED IN THOSE DAYS LILY REIGNED AS A QUEEN AT THE SMALL HOUSE
5712-48842-0007 ILL USAGE AND ILLNESS TOGETHER FALLING INTO HER HANDS HAD GIVEN HER SUCH POWER THAT NONE OF THE OTHER WOMEN WERE ABLE TO WITHSTAND IT NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT IT BUT IT WAS UNDERSTOOD BY THEM ALL JANE AND THE COOK INCLUDED
5712-48842-0008 THE DAY WAS NAMED SOON ENOUGH AND THE TIDINGS CAME DOWN TO ALLINGTON ON THE FOURTEENTH OF FEBRUARY CROSBIE WAS TO BE MADE A HAPPY MAN THIS WAS NOT KNOWN TO THE DALES TILL THE TWELFTH AND THEY WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE SPARED THE KNOWLEDGE THEN
5712-48842-0009 BUT THERE WAS PERHAPS AT THE BOTTOM OF THEM A FEELING THAT AS THE FAMILY INTENDED TO LEAVE THE SMALL HOUSE AT THE END OF MARCH IT WOULD BE WELL TO LET THE SQUIRE KNOW THAT THERE WAS NO ENMITY IN THEIR HEARTS AGAINST HIM NOTHING MORE HAD BEEN SAID ABOUT THEIR MOVING
5712-48842-0010 WITH BELL DURING THESE VISITS HE NEVER ALLUDED TO THE MATTER SHE WAS THE CHIEF SINNER IN THAT SHE HAD REFUSED TO MARRY HER COUSIN AND HAD DECLINED EVEN TO LISTEN TO RATIONAL COUNSEL UPON THE MATTER BUT THE SQUIRE FELT
5712-48842-0011 THAT HE COULD NOT DISCUSS THE SUBJECT WITH HER SEEING THAT HE HAD BEEN SPECIALLY INFORMED BY MISSUS DALE THAT HIS INTERFERENCE WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED AND THEN HE WAS PERHAPS AWARE THAT IF HE DID DISCUSS THE SUBJECT WITH BELL HE WOULD NOT GAIN MUCH BY SUCH DISCUSSION
5712-48842-0012 THEIR CONVERSATION THEREFORE GENERALLY FELL UPON CROSBIE AND THE TONE IN WHICH HE WAS MENTIONED IN THE GREAT HOUSE WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT ASSUMED IN LILY'S PRESENCE
5712-48842-0013 HE'LL BE A WRETCHED MAN SAID THE SQUIRE WHEN HE TOLD BELL OF THE DAY THAT HAD BEEN FIXED I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE WRETCHED SAID BELL BUT I CAN HARDLY THINK THAT HE CAN ACT AS HE HAS DONE WITHOUT BEING PUNISHED HE WILL BE A WRETCHED MAN
5712-48842-0014 HE GETS NO FORTUNE WITH HER AND SHE WILL EXPECT EVERYTHING THAT FORTUNE CAN GIVE I BELIEVE TOO THAT SHE IS OLDER THAN HE IS I CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT UPON MY WORD I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW A MAN CAN BE SUCH A KNAVE AND SUCH A FOOL GIVE MY LOVE TO LILY
5712-48842-0015 SUCH A FROST AS BREAKS THE WATER PIPES AND BINDS THE GROUND TO THE HARDNESS OF GRANITE LILY QUEEN AS SHE WAS HAD NOT YET BEEN ALLOWED TO GO BACK TO HER OWN CHAMBER BUT OCCUPIED THE LARGER BED IN HER MOTHER'S ROOM HER MOTHER SLEEPING ON A SMALLER ONE
5712-48842-0016 WHY SHOULD THEIR HEARTS BE COLD OH MAMMA THAT IS A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY WHY SHOULD THEIR HEARTS BE COLD I HOPE IT MAY NOT BE SO OF COURSE YOU DO OF COURSE WE ALL HOPE IT HE WAS NOT COLD HEARTED AT ANY RATE
5712-48842-0017 A MAN IS NOT COLD HEARTED BECAUSE HE DOES NOT KNOW HIMSELF MAMMA I WANT YOU TO WISH FOR THEIR HAPPINESS MISSUS DALE WAS SILENT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO BEFORE SHE ANSWERED THIS BUT THEN SHE DID ANSWER IT
5712-48842-0018 YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL IN WRAPPING YOURSELF AS YOU GO DOWNSTAIRS SAID BELL WHO STOOD BY THE TRAY ON WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT UP THE TOAST AND TEA THE COLD IS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL AWFUL I SHOULD CALL IT JOLLY SAID LILY IF I COULD GET UP AND GO OUT
5712-48842-0019 I KNOW WHAT YOUR FOOT MEANS WHEN IT GOES IN THAT WAY AND YOU SHAN'T DO IT COME HERE BELL AND LET ME TEACH YOU CHRISTIANITY I'M A FINE SORT OF TEACHER AM I NOT AND I DID NOT QUITE MEAN THAT I WISH I COULD LEARN IT FROM SOME ONE SAID BELL
5712-48842-0020 THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WHAT WE CALL CHRISTIANITY SEEMS TO ME TO BE HARDLY POSSIBLE WHEN YOUR FOOT GOES IN THAT WAY IT IS A VERY UNCHRISTIAN FOOT AND YOU OUGHT TO KEEP IT STILL IT MEANS ANGER AGAINST HIM
5712-48842-0021 BECAUSE HE DISCOVERED BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE THAT HE WOULD NOT BE HAPPY THAT IS THAT HE AND I WOULD NOT BE HAPPY TOGETHER IF WE WERE MARRIED DON'T SCRUTINIZE MY FOOT TOO CLOSELY LILY
5712-48842-0022 THAT I GAVE MYSELF UP TO HIM ALL AT ONCE WITHOUT GIVING HIM A CHANCE OF THINKING OF IT IN A WEEK OR TWO IT WAS DONE WHO COULD EXPECT THAT SUCH AN ENGAGEMENT SHOULD BE LASTING AND WHY NOT THAT IS NONSENSE LILY
5712-48842-0023 BUT WE WILL NOT TALK ABOUT IT AH BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT IT WAS AS I HAVE SAID AND IF SO YOU SHOULDN'T HATE HIM BECAUSE HE DID THE ONLY THING WHICH HE HONESTLY COULD DO WHEN HE FOUND OUT HIS MISTAKE
5712-48842-0024 AND THEN SHE REMEMBERED THAT THAT OTHER LADY MIGHT AT THIS VERY MOMENT POSSESS THE NAME WHICH SHE HAD ONCE BEEN SO PROUD TO THINK THAT SHE WOULD BEAR HERSELF BELL SHE SAID STOPPING HER OTHER SPEECH SUDDENLY AT WHAT O'CLOCK DO PEOPLE GET MARRIED IN LONDON
5712-48842-0025 OH AT ALL MANNER OF HOURS ANY TIME BEFORE TWELVE THEY WILL BE FASHIONABLE AND WILL BE MARRIED LATE YOU DON'T THINK SHE'S MISSUS CROSBIE YET THEN LADY ALEXANDRINA CROSBIE SAID BELL SHUDDERING YES
5712-48842-0026 OF COURSE I FORGOT I SHOULD SO LIKE TO SEE HER I FEEL SUCH AN INTEREST ABOUT HER I WONDER WHAT COLOURED HAIR SHE HAS I SUPPOSE SHE IS A SORT OF JUNO OF A WOMAN VERY TALL AND HANDSOME I'M SURE SHE HAS NOT GOT A PUG NOSE LIKE ME
5712-48842-0027 ONLY OF COURSE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO BE GODMOTHER TO HIS FIRST CHILD OH LILY I SHOULD DON'T YOU HEAR ME SAY THAT I KNOW IT'S NOT POSSIBLE I'M NOT GOING UP TO LONDON TO ASK HER
5712-48842-0028 I SHOULD NEVER HAVE DONE FOR THAT KIND OF THING SHOULD I THERE IS NOTHING I DESPISE SO MUCH AS WHAT YOU CALL THAT KIND OF THING DO YOU I DON'T AFTER ALL THINK HOW MUCH WORK THEY DO HE USED TO TELL ME OF THAT
5712-48842-0029 THEY HAVE ALL THE GOVERNING IN THEIR HANDS AND GET VERY LITTLE MONEY FOR DOING IT WORSE LUCK FOR THE COUNTRY THE COUNTRY SEEMS TO DO PRETTY WELL BUT YOU'RE A RADICAL BELL MY BELIEF IS YOU WOULDN'T BE A LADY IF YOU COULD HELP IT
5712-48842-0030 I'D SOONER BE AN HONEST WOMAN AND SO YOU ARE MY OWN DEAR DEAREST HONEST BELL AND THE FAIREST LADY THAT I KNOW IF I WERE A MAN BELL YOU ARE JUST THE GIRL THAT I SHOULD WORSHIP BUT YOU ARE NOT A MAN SO IT'S NO GOOD
5712-48842-0031 BUT YOU MUSTN'T LET YOUR FOOT GO ASTRAY IN THAT WAY YOU MUSTN'T INDEED SOMEBODY SAID THAT WHATEVER IS IS RIGHT AND I DECLARE I BELIEVE IT I'M SOMETIMES INCLINED TO THINK THAT WHATEVER IS IS WRONG
5712-48842-0032 IT'S ONLY HALF PAST TEN YET I SHOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED IF IT'S OVER OVER WHAT A WORD THAT IS A THING LIKE THAT IS OVER AND THEN ALL THE WORLD CANNOT PUT IT BACK AGAIN WHAT IF HE SHOULD BE UNHAPPY AFTER ALL
5712-48842-0033 HE MUST TAKE HIS CHANCE SAID BELL THINKING WITHIN HER OWN MIND THAT THAT CHANCE WOULD BE A VERY BAD ONE OF COURSE HE MUST TAKE HIS CHANCE WELL I'LL GET UP NOW
5712-48842-0034 HE HAS MADE THAT LADY HIS WIFE I HOPE GOD WILL BLESS THEM AND I PRAY THAT THEY MAY BE HAPPY AS SHE SPOKE THESE WORDS THERE WAS AN UNWONTED SOLEMNITY IN HER TONE WHICH STARTLED MISSUS DALE AND BELL
5712-48842-0035 I ALSO WILL HOPE SO SAID MISSUS DALE AND NOW LILY WILL IT NOT BE WELL THAT YOU SHOULD TURN YOUR MIND AWAY FROM THE SUBJECT AND ENDEAVOUR TO THINK OF OTHER THINGS BUT I CAN'T MAMMA IT IS SO EASY TO SAY THAT
5712-48842-0036 BUT PEOPLE CAN'T CHOOSE THEIR OWN THOUGHTS THEY CAN USUALLY DIRECT THEM AS THEY WILL IF THEY MAKE THE EFFORT BUT I CAN'T MAKE THE EFFORT INDEED I DON'T KNOW WHY I SHOULD IT SEEMS NATURAL TO ME TO THINK ABOUT HIM
5712-48842-0037 AND I DON'T SUPPOSE IT CAN BE VERY WRONG WHEN YOU HAVE HAD SO DEEP AN INTEREST IN A PERSON YOU CAN'T DROP HIM ALL OF A SUDDEN THEN THERE WAS AGAIN SILENCE AND AFTER A WHILE LILY TOOK UP HER NOVEL
5712-48842-0038 I THINK I'LL READ PILGRIM'S PROGRESS AGAIN
5712-48842-0039 OR PAUL AND VIRGINIA SAID LILY BUT I BELIEVE I'LL HAVE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS I NEVER CAN UNDERSTAND IT BUT I RATHER THINK THAT MAKES IT NICER I HATE BOOKS I CAN'T UNDERSTAND SAID BELL I LIKE A BOOK TO BE CLEAR AS RUNNING WATER
5712-48842-0040 SO THAT THE WHOLE MEANING MAY BE SEEN AT ONCE THE QUICK SEEING OF THE MEANING MUST DEPEND A LITTLE ON THE READER MUST IT NOT SAID MISSUS DALE THE READER MUSTN'T BE A FOOL OF COURSE SAID BELL BUT THEN SO MANY READERS ARE FOOLS SAID LILY
5712-48842-0041 AND YET THEY GET SOMETHING OUT OF THEIR READING MISSUS CRUMP IS ALWAYS PORING OVER THE REVELATIONS AND NEARLY KNOWS THEM BY HEART I DON'T THINK SHE COULD INTERPRET A SINGLE IMAGE BUT SHE HAS A HAZY MISTY IDEA OF THE TRUTH THAT'S WHY SHE LIKES IT
5712-48842-0042 THE PERSONAGES ARE ALWAYS IN THEIR TANTRUMS AND GO ON AS THOUGH THEY WERE MAD MAMMA DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING FOR THE HONEYMOON NO MY DEAR HE USED TO TALK TO ME ABOUT GOING TO THE LAKES
5712-48842-0043 AND THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER PAUSE DURING WHICH BELL OBSERVED THAT HER MOTHER'S FACE BECAME CLOUDED WITH ANXIETY BUT I WON'T THINK OF IT ANY MORE CONTINUED LILY I WILL FIX MY MIND TO SOMETHING AND THEN SHE GOT UP FROM HER CHAIR
5712-48842-0044 OF COURSE IT WOULD NOT MY DARLING AND I'M GOING TO BE WELL AGAIN NOW IMMEDIATELY LET ME SEE I WAS TOLD TO READ CARLYLE'S HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND I THINK I'LL BEGIN NOW IT WAS CROSBIE WHO HAD TOLD HER TO READ THE BOOK
5712-48842-0045 AS BOTH BELL AND MISSUS DALE WERE WELL AWARE
5712-48842-0046 JANE SHALL FETCH IT IF YOU REALLY WANT IT SAID MISSUS DALE BELL SHALL GET IT WHEN SHE GOES UP IN THE AFTERNOON WILL YOU BELL AND I'LL TRY TO GET ON WITH THIS STUFF IN THE MEANTIME THEN AGAIN SHE SAT WITH HER EYES FIXED UPON THE PAGES OF THE BOOK
5712-48842-0047 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MAMMA YOU MAY HAVE SOME COMFORT IN THIS THAT WHEN TO DAY'S GONE BY I SHAN'T MAKE A FUSS ABOUT ANY OTHER DAY NOBODY THINKS THAT YOU ARE MAKING A FUSS LILY YES BUT I AM ISN'T IT ODD BELL
5712-48842-0048 THAT IT SHOULD TAKE PLACE ON VALENTINE'S DAY
5712-48842-0049 I USED TO THINK SO OFTEN OF THE LETTER THAT I SHOULD GET FROM HIM ON THIS DAY WHEN HE WOULD TELL ME THAT I WAS HIS VALENTINE WELL HE'S GOT ANOTHER VALEN TINE NOW SO MUCH SHE SAID WITH ARTICULATE VOICE
5712-48842-0050 AND THEN SHE BROKE DOWN BURSTING OUT INTO CONVULSIVE SOBS AND CRYING IN HER MOTHER'S ARMS AS THOUGH SHE WOULD BREAK HER HEART AND YET HER HEART WAS NOT BROKEN AND SHE WAS STILL STRONG IN THAT RESOLVE WHICH SHE HAD MADE THAT HER GRIEF SHOULD NOT OVERPOWER HER
5712-48842-0051 AND SHE STRUGGLED GRIEVOUSLY TO GET THE BETTER OF THE HYSTERICAL ATTACK WHICH HAD OVERPOWERED HER I WON'T BE REGARDED AS ILL USED NOT AS SPECIALLY ILL USED BUT I AM YOUR DARLING YOUR OWN DARLING ONLY I WISH YOU'D BEAT ME AND THUMP ME WHEN I'M SUCH A FOOL INSTEAD OF PITYING ME
5712-48842-0052 SAID BELL BECAUSE IF WE ARE ILL HE WON'T HAVE SUCH A TERRIBLE DISTANCE TO COME THAT WILL BE A COMFORT FOR HIM I SHOULD THINK SAID BELL VERY DEMURELY IN THE EVENING THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION HAD BEEN PROCURED
5712-48842-0053 AND LILY STUCK TO HER READING WITH LAUDABLE PERSEVERANCE TILL AT EIGHT HER MOTHER INSISTED ON HER GOING TO BED QUEEN AS SHE WAS I DON'T BELIEVE A BIT YOU KNOW THAT THE KING WAS SUCH A BAD MAN AS THAT SHE SAID I DO SAID BELL
5712-48842-0054 AH THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE A RADICAL I NEVER WILL BELIEVE THAT KINGS ARE SO MUCH WORSE THAN OTHER PEOPLE AS FOR CHARLES THE FIRST HE WAS ABOUT THE BEST MAN IN HISTORY THIS WAS AN OLD SUBJECT OF DISPUTE BUT LILY ON THE PRESENT OCCASION WAS ALLOWED HER OWN WAY
