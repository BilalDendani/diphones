4110-11528-0000 SLOWLY WE WERE DRIVEN BACK DOWN THE BROAD STREET AND TOWARD THE PALACE AS WE RETREATED OLD PEOPLE AND CHILDREN CAME FROM THE HOUSES AND WENT WITH US LEAVING THEIR DWELLINGS TO THE MERCY OF THE MONSTERS
4110-11528-0001 A BLOCK FROM THE PALACE WE BUNCHED TOGETHER AND BY SHEER MASS AND FEROCITY ACTUALLY STOPPED THE MACHINELIKE ADVANCE FOR A FEW MOMENTS MISCELLANEOUS WEAPONS HAD BEEN BROUGHT FROM THE HOUSES SLEDGES STONE BENCHES
4110-11528-0002 AND HANDED TO US IN SILENCE BY THE NONCOMBATANTS SOMEBODY TUGGED AT MY SLEEVE LOOKING DOWN I SAW A LITTLE GIRL
4110-11528-0003 I SEIZED THE FORMIDABLE WEAPON AND JUMPED AT THE NEAREST QUABO A TEN FOOT GIANT WHOSE EYES WERE GLINTING GIGANTICALLY AT ME THROUGH THE DISTORTING CURVE OF THE GLASS DISREGARDING THE CLUTCHING TENTACLES ENTIRELY I SWUNG THE BAR AGAINST THE HELMET IT CRACKED
4110-11528-0004 I SWUNG AGAIN AND IT FELL IN FRAGMENTS SPILLING THE GALLONS OF WATER IT HAD CONTAINED THE TENTACLES WOUND VENGEFULLY AROUND ME BUT IN A FEW SECONDS THEY RELAXED AS THE THING GASPED OUT ITS LIFE IN THE AIR
4110-11528-0005 AND FOUND MYSELF FACING THE QUEEN HER HEAD WAS HELD BRAVELY HIGH THOUGH THE VIOLET OF HER EYES HAD GONE ALMOST BLACK WITH FEAR
4110-11528-0006 WHY ART THOU HERE GO BACK TO THE PALACE AT ONCE I CAME TO FIGHT BESIDE THEE SHE ANSWERED COMPOSEDLY THOUGH HER DELICATE LIPS QUIVERED ALL IS LOST IT SEEMS SO SHALL I DIE BESIDE THEE
4110-11528-0007 I STARTED TO REPLY TO URGE HER AGAIN TO SEEK THE SAFETY OF THE PALACE BUT BY NOW THE DEADLY ADVANCE OF THE TENTACLED DEMONS HAD BEGUN ONCE MORE FIGHTING VAINLY THE POPULATION OF ZYOBOR WAS SWEPT INTO THE PALACE GROUNDS THEN INTO THE BUILDING ITSELF MEN
4110-11528-0008 REPLIED STANLEY WITH A SHRUG THESE FISH HAVE OUT THOUGHT US NONSENSE THERE MAY STILL BE A WAY A BRACE OF MACHINE GUNS I MURMURED HOPEFULLY YOU MIGHT AS WELL WISH FOR A DOZEN LIGHT CANNON SNAPPED THE PROFESSOR PLEASE TRY TO
4110-11528-0009 CONCENTRATE AND SEE IF ANY EFFECTIVE WEAPON SUGGESTS ITSELF TO YOU SOMETHING MORE AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT THAN MACHINE GUNS IN SILENCE THE THREE OF US RACKED OUR BRAINS FOR A MEANS OF DEFENCE
4110-11528-0010 CAME QUIETLY OVER TO US AND SAT ON THE BENCH BESIDE ME FRANKLY I COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO MY MIND WE WERE SURELY DOOMED WHAT ARMS COULD POSSIBLY BE CONTRIVED AT SUCH SHORT NOTICE WHAT WEAPON COULD BE CALLED FORTH
4110-11528-0011 GLASS WHAT DESTROYS IT SHARP BLOWS CERTAIN ACIDS
4110-11528-0012 THAT'S IT HE TURNED EXCITEDLY TO THE QUEEN I THINK WE HAVE IT AT LEAST IT'S WORTH TRYING
4110-11528-0013 HAST THOU IN THE PALACE ANY LENGTHS OF PIPE LIKE TO THAT WHICH THE QUABOS DRAG BEHIND THEM NO
4110-11528-0014 HER EYES ROUND AND WONDERING THEN SHE INTERRUPTED HERSELF AH YES THERE IS IN A VAULT NEAR THAT OF KILOR'S THERE IS A GREAT SPOOL OF IT
4110-11528-0015 WAS CUT INTO THREE PIECES EACH ABOUT FIFTY YARDS LONG THESE WERE CONNECTED TO THREE OF THE LARGEST GAS VENTS OF THE PALACE STANLEY THE PROFESSOR AND I EACH TOOK AN END AND WE PREPARED TO FIGHT WITH FIRE THE CREATURES OF WATER
4110-11528-0016 IT OUGHT TO WORK STANLEY REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES AS THOUGH TRYING TO REASSURE HIMSELF AS WELL AS US IT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH THE WATER IN THOSE HELMETS IS ICE COLD
4110-11528-0017 DRAGGING OUR HOSE TO THE BIG FRONT ENTRANCE OF THE PALACE AND WARNING THE CROWDED PEOPLE TO KEEP THEIR FEET CLEAR OF IT WE PREPARED TO TEST OUT THE EFFICIENCY OF THIS OUR LAST RESOURCE AGAINST THE ENEMY
4110-11528-0018 FOR AN INSTANT WE PAUSED JUST INSIDE THE DOORWAY LOOKING OUT AT THE UGLY GLASSED IN THINGS THAT WERE MASSING TO ATTACK US AGAIN THE RANKS OF QUABOS HAD CLOSED IN NOW
4110-11528-0019 TILL THEY EXTENDED DOWN THE STREET FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED YARDS IN CLOSE FORMATION A FOREST OF GREAT PULPY HEADS WITH HUGE EYES THAT GLARED UNBLINKINGLY AT THE GLITTERING PINK BUILDING THAT WAS THEIR OBJECTIVE LIGHT UP ORDERED STANLEY
4110-11528-0020 SETTING AN EXAMPLE BY TOUCHING HIS HOSE NOZZLE TO THE NEAREST WALL JET A SPURT OF FIRE BELCHED FROM HIS HOSE STREAMING OUT FOR FOUR OR FIVE FEET IN A SOLID RED CONE THE PROFESSOR AND I TOUCHED OFF OUR TORCHES
4110-11528-0021 AND WE MOVED SLOWLY OUT THE DOOR TOWARD THE RANKS OF QUABOS DON'T TRY TO SAVE YOURSELVES FROM THEIR TENTACLES ADVISED STANLEY WALK RIGHT UP TO THEM DIRECT THE FIRE AGAINST THEIR HELMETS
4110-11528-0022 UNBLINKING EYES GLARING TENTACLES WRITHING WARILY LITTLE SPURTS OF USED WATER TRICKLING FROM THEIR HELMETS KEEP TOGETHER WARNED STANLEY SO THAT IF ANY ONE OF US LOSES HIS LIGHT HE CAN GET IT FROM THE HOSE OF ONE OF THE OTHER TWO AND
4110-11528-0023 THE LAST STAND WAS BEGUN IT WAS NOT A BATTLE SO MUCH AS A SERIES OF FIERCE DUELS THE QUABOS REALIZED THEIR NEW DANGER INSTANTLY AND DEVOTED ALL THEIR EFFORTS TO EXTINGUISHING OUR TORCHES
4110-11528-0024 WE PARRIED AND THRUST WITH THE FLAMING HOSES IN AN EQUALLY DESPERATE EFFORT TO PREVENT IT ONE OF THEM SCUTTLED TOWARD ME LIKE A GREAT CRAB A TENTACLE DARTED TOWARD MY RIGHT ARM ANOTHER WAS PRESSED AGAINST THE NOZZLE THERE WAS A SICKENING SMELL
4110-11528-0025 AND THE TENTACLE WAS JERKED SPASMODICALLY AWAY
4110-11528-0026 A SHOUT OF SAVAGE EXULTATION BROKE FROM MY LIPS HARDLY
4110-11528-0027 I WENT TOWARD THE NEXT ONE SWINGING THE FLARING HOSE IN A SLOW ARC AS I ADVANCED THE CREATURE LUNGED AT ME AND THRESHED AT THE BURNING JET WITH ALL FOUR OF ITS FEELERS
4110-11528-0028 THE GHASTLY TENTACLES WERE DRY WITHERED AND SOFT
4110-11528-0029 NEVERTHELESS WITH A SWIFT MOVE IT SLAPPED A TENTACLE SQUARELY DOWN OVER THE HOSE NOZZLE THE FLAME WAS EXTINGUISHED AS THE FLAME OF A CANDLE IS PINCHED OUT BETWEEN THUMB AND FOREFINGER I RETREATED CATCH
4110-11528-0030 THE WELCOME RUSH OF WATER OVER THE CREAM COLORED GRASS AND ANOTHER MONSTER WAS WRITHING IN THE DEATH THROES KEEPING CLOSE TOGETHER
4110-11528-0031 AGAIN AND AGAIN THE FIERY WEAPON OF ONE OR THE OTHER OF US WAS DASHED OUT TO BE RE LIGHTED FROM THE NEAREST HOSE AGAIN AND AGAIN LOUD DETONATIONS HERALDED THE COLLAPSE OF MORE OF THE INVADERS
4110-11528-0032 BUT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THEIR FLAILING TENTACLES WERE AS MYRIAD AS THE STARS THEY HAD NEVER SEEN IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THEIR NUMBERS WOULD NEVER APPRECIABLY DIMINISH WE THRUST AND PARRIED TILL OUR ARMS GREW NUMB AND STILL THERE APPEARED TO BE HUNDREDS OF THE QUABOS LEFT
4110-11528-0033 BY ORDER OF THE QUEEN THREE STOUT ZYOBITES STEPPED UP TO US AND RELIEVED US OF OUR EXHAUSTING LABOR GLADLY WE HANDED THE HOSES TO THEM AND WENT TO THE PALACE FOR A MUCH NEEDED REST
4110-11528-0034 TOWARD THEIR TUNNEL AND HERE THE PROFESSOR TOOK COMMAND AGAIN WE MUSTN'T LET THEM GET AWAY TO TRY SOME NEW SCHEME HE SNAPPED MARTIN TAKE FIFTY MEN AND BEAT THEM BACK TO THE BREAK IN THE WALL
4110-11528-0035 THEY MOVE SO SLOWLY THAT YOU CAN EASILY CUT OFF THEIR RETREAT THERE ISN'T ANY MORE HOSE BEGAN STANLEY THERE'S PLENTY OF IT THE QUABOS BROUGHT IT WITH THEM THE PROFESSOR TURNED TO ME AGAIN TAKE METAL SAWS WITH YOU
4110-11528-0036 TO THE NEAREST WALL JETS RUN I RAN WITH FIFTY OF THE MEN OF ZYOBOR CLOSE BEHIND ME WE DODGED OUT THE SIDE OF THE PALACE GROUNDS LEAST GUARDED BY THE QUABOS DUCKING BETWEEN THEIR RANKS LIKE INFANTRY MEN THREADING THROUGH AN OPPOSITION
4110-11528-0037 OF POWERFUL BUT SLOW MOVING TANKS FOUR OF OUR NUMBER WERE CAUGHT BUT THE REST GOT THROUGH UNSCATHED DOWN A SIDE STREET WE RACED AND ALONG A PARALLEL AVENUE TOWARD THE TUNNEL AS WE WENT I PRAYED THAT ALL THE QUABOS HAD CENTERED
4110-11528-0038 THEIR ATTENTION ON THE PALACE AND LEFT THEIR VULNERABLE WATER HOSES UNGUARDED THEY HAD WHEN WE STOLE UP THE LAST BLOCK TOWARD THE BREAK WE FOUND THE NEAREST QUABO WAS A HUNDRED YARDS DOWN THE STREET AND WORKING FURTHER AWAY WITH EVERY MOVE
4110-11528-0039 AT ONCE WE SET TO WORK ON THE SCORES OF HOSES THAT QUIVERED OVER THE FLOOR WITH EACH MOVE OF THE DISTANT MONSTERS A ZYOBITE WITH THE MUSCLES OF A HERCULES SWUNG HIS AX MIGHTILY DOWN ON A HOSE
4110-11528-0040 THE METAL WAS SOFT ENOUGH TO BE SHEERED THROUGH BY THE STROKE THE CUT ENDS WERE SMASHED SO THAT THEY COULD NOT BE CRAMMED DOWN OVER THE TAPERING JETS
4110-11528-0041 BEFORE THE QUABOS HAD REACHED US WE HAD RIGGED SIX FIRE HOSES AND HAD CUT THROUGH FORTY OR FIFTY MORE WATER LINES THE END WAS CERTAIN AND NOT LONG IN COMING WE SPRAYED THE MONSTERS WITH FIRE AS WORKMEN SPRAY FRUIT TREES WITH INSECT POISON
4110-11528-0042 STANLEY THE PROFESSOR AND A ZYOBITE CAME UP IN THE REAR WITH THEIR THREE HOSES CAUGHT BETWEEN THE TWO FORCES THE BEATEN FISH MILLED IN HOPELESS CONFUSION AND INDECISION IN HALF AN HOUR THEY WERE ALL REDUCED TO HUDDLES OF SLIMY WET FLESH
4110-11528-0043 THAT DOTTED THE PAVEMENT FROM THE BREAK BACK TO THE PALACE GROUNDS THE INVADERS WERE COMPLETELY ANNIHILATED AND THE CITY OF ZYOBOR WAS SAVED NOW SAID THE PROFESSOR TRIUMPHANTLY
4110-11528-0044 WE HAVE ONLY TO KNOCK OUT THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE TUNNEL WALL EMPTY THE TUNNEL AND MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO MORE QUABOS LURKING THERE AFTER THAT WE CAN FILL IT IN WITH SOLID CEMENT THE QUEEN CAN ORDER HER FISH SERVANTS TO GUARD THE OUTER CAVE
4110-11528-0045 WE KNEW EACH OTHERS THOUGHTS WELL ENOUGH HE COULD RESUME HIS COMPANIONSHIP
4110-11528-0046 WITH THE MENACE OF THE QUABOS BANISHED FOREVER THE CITY OF ZYOBOR RESUMED ITS NORMAL WAY THE CITIZENS LOWERED THEIR DEAD INTO THE GREAT WELL WE HAD CUT WITH APPROPRIATE RITES PERFORMED BY THE QUEEN
4110-11528-0047 THE DAILY TASKS AND PLEASURES WERE PICKED UP WHERE THEY HAD BEEN DROPPED THE HAUNTING FEAR DIED FROM THE EYES OF THE PEOPLE SHORTLY AFTERWARD WITH GREAT CEREMONY AND CELEBRATION I WAS MADE KING OF ZYOBOR
4110-11528-0048 TO RULE BY AGA'S SIDE
4110-11528-0049 HE IS SECOND TO ME IN POWER THE PROFESSOR IS THE OFFICIAL WISE MAN OF THE CITY LIFE FLOWS SMOOTHLY FOR US IN THIS PINK LIGHTED COMMUNITY WE ARE MORE THAN CONTENT WITH OUR LOT HERE OUR ONLY CONCERN HAS BEEN THE GRIEF
4110-11528-0050 THAT MUST HAVE BEEN OCCASIONED OUR RELATIVES AND FRIENDS WHEN THE ROSA SAILED HOME WITHOUT US NOW WE HAVE THOUGHT OF A WAY IN WHICH WITH LUCK WE MAY COMMUNICATE WITH THE UPPER WORLD BY RELAYS OF MY QUEEN'S FISH SERVANTS
