3294-167609-0019 AN ELDERLY SERGEANT WHO HAD APPROACHED THE OFFICER WHILE HE WAS GIVING THESE EXPLANATIONS HAD WAITED IN SILENCE FOR HIM TO FINISH SPEAKING BUT AT THIS POINT EVIDENTLY NOT LIKING THE OFFICER'S REMARK INTERRUPTED HIM

3294-167609-0033 STANDING AMONG THE CROWD OF PEASANTS PIERRE RECOGNIZED SEVERAL ACQUAINTANCES AMONG THESE NOTABLES BUT DID NOT LOOK AT THEM HIS WHOLE ATTENTION WAS ABSORBED IN WATCHING THE SERIOUS EXPRESSION ON THE FACES OF THE CROWD OF SOLDIERS
3294-167609-0034 AND MILITIAMEN WHO WERE ALL GAZING EAGERLY AT THE ICON AS SOON AS THE TIRED CHANTERS WHO WERE SINGING THE SERVICE FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT DAY

3294-167609-0040 WITH UNCOVERED WHITE HEAD AND PUFFY FACE SHOWING THE WHITE BALL OF THE EYE HE HAD LOST KUTUZOV
