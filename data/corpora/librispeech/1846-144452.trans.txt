1846-144452-0000 CHAPTER THREE I HAVE A CHANGE THE CARRIER'S HORSE WAS THE LAZIEST HORSE IN THE WORLD I SHOULD HOPE AND SHUFFLED ALONG WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AS IF HE LIKED TO KEEP PEOPLE WAITING TO WHOM THE PACKAGES WERE DIRECTED I FANCIED INDEED
1846-144452-0001 THAT HE SOMETIMES CHUCKLED AUDIBLY OVER THIS REFLECTION BUT THE CARRIER SAID HE WAS ONLY TROUBLED WITH A COUGH THE CARRIER HAD A WAY OF KEEPING HIS HEAD DOWN LIKE HIS HORSE AND OF DROOPING SLEEPILY FORWARD AS HE DROVE WITH ONE OF HIS ARMS ON EACH OF HIS KNEES
1846-144452-0002 I SAY DROVE BUT IT STRUCK ME THAT THE CART WOULD HAVE GONE TO YARMOUTH QUITE AS WELL WITHOUT HIM FOR THE HORSE DID ALL THAT AND AS TO CONVERSATION HE HAD NO IDEA OF IT BUT WHISTLING PEGGOTTY HAD A BASKET OF REFRESHMENTS ON HER KNEE
1846-144452-0003 WHICH WOULD HAVE LASTED US OUT HANDSOMELY IF WE HAD BEEN GOING TO LONDON BY THE SAME CONVEYANCE WE ATE A GOOD DEAL AND SLEPT A GOOD DEAL PEGGOTTY ALWAYS WENT TO SLEEP WITH HER CHIN UPON THE HANDLE OF THE BASKET
1846-144452-0004 IF THE WORLD WERE REALLY AS ROUND AS MY GEOGRAPHY BOOK SAID HOW ANY PART OF IT CAME TO BE SO FLAT BUT I REFLECTED THAT YARMOUTH MIGHT BE SITUATED AT ONE OF THE POLES WHICH WOULD ACCOUNT FOR IT
1846-144452-0005 AS WE DREW A LITTLE NEARER AND SAW THE WHOLE ADJACENT PROSPECT LYING A STRAIGHT LOW LINE UNDER THE SKY I HINTED TO PEGGOTTY THAT A MOUND OR SO MIGHT HAVE IMPROVED IT
1846-144452-0006 THAT WE MUST TAKE THINGS AS WE FOUND THEM AND THAT FOR HER PART SHE WAS PROUD TO CALL HERSELF A YARMOUTH BLOATER WHEN WE GOT INTO THE STREET WHICH WAS STRANGE ENOUGH TO ME AND SMELT THE FISH AND PITCH
1846-144452-0007 UPON THE WHOLE THE FINEST PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE HERE'S MY AM SCREAMED PEGGOTTY GROWED OUT OF KNOWLEDGE HE WAS WAITING FOR US IN FACT AT THE PUBLIC HOUSE
1846-144452-0008 AND ASKED ME HOW I FOUND MYSELF LIKE AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE I DID NOT FEEL AT FIRST THAT I KNEW HIM AS WELL AS HE KNEW ME BECAUSE HE HAD NEVER COME TO OUR HOUSE SINCE THE NIGHT I WAS BORN AND NATURALLY HE HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF ME
1846-144452-0009 BUT OUR INTIMACY WAS MUCH ADVANCED BY HIS TAKING ME ON HIS BACK TO CARRY ME HOME HE WAS NOW A HUGE STRONG FELLOW OF SIX FEET HIGH BROAD IN PROPORTION AND ROUND SHOULDERED BUT WITH A SIMPERING BOY'S FACE AND
1846-144452-0010 CURLY LIGHT HAIR THAT GAVE HIM QUITE A SHEEPISH LOOK HE WAS DRESSED IN A CANVAS JACKET AND A PAIR OF SUCH VERY STIFF TROUSERS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE STOOD QUITE AS WELL ALONE WITHOUT ANY LEGS IN THEM AND YOU COULDN'T SO PROPERLY HAVE SAID HE WORE A HAT
1846-144452-0011 WE TURNED DOWN LANES BESTREWN WITH BITS OF CHIPS AND LITTLE HILLOCKS OF SAND AND WENT PAST GAS WORKS ROPE WALKS BOAT BUILDERS YARDS SHIPWRIGHTS YARDS SHIP BREAKERS YARDS CAULKERS YARDS RIGGERS LOFTS SMITHS FORGES
1846-144452-0012 AS FAR AS I COULD STARE OVER THE WILDERNESS AND AWAY AT THE SEA AND AWAY AT THE RIVER BUT NO HOUSE COULD I MAKE OUT THERE WAS A BLACK BARGE OR SOME OTHER KIND OF SUPERANNUATED BOAT NOT FAR OFF
1846-144452-0013 HIGH AND DRY ON THE GROUND WITH AN IRON FUNNEL STICKING OUT OF IT FOR A CHIMNEY AND SMOKING VERY COSILY BUT NOTHING ELSE IN THE WAY OF A HABITATION THAT WAS VISIBLE TO ME THAT'S NOT IT SAID I THAT SHIP LOOKING THING
1846-144452-0014 THAT'S IT MAS'R DAVY RETURNED HAM IF IT HAD BEEN ALADDIN'S PALACE ROC'S EGG AND ALL
1846-144452-0015 THERE WAS A DELIGHTFUL DOOR CUT IN THE SIDE AND IT WAS ROOFED IN AND THERE WERE LITTLE WINDOWS IN IT BUT THE WONDERFUL CHARM OF IT WAS THAT IT WAS A REAL BOAT WHICH HAD NO DOUBT BEEN UPON THE WATER HUNDREDS OF TIMES
1846-144452-0016 AND WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN INTENDED TO BE LIVED IN ON DRY LAND THAT WAS THE CAPTIVATION OF IT TO ME IF IT HAD EVER BEEN MEANT TO BE LIVED IN I MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT IT SMALL OR INCONVENIENT OR LONELY
1846-144452-0017 BUT NEVER HAVING BEEN DESIGNED FOR ANY SUCH USE IT BECAME A PERFECT ABODE IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY CLEAN INSIDE AND AS TIDY AS POSSIBLE THERE WAS A TABLE AND A DUTCH CLOCK AND A CHEST OF DRAWERS
1846-144452-0018 AND ON THE CHEST OF DRAWERS THERE WAS A TEA TRAY WITH A PAINTING ON IT OF A LADY WITH A PARASOL TAKING A WALK WITH A MILITARY LOOKING CHILD WHO WAS TRUNDLING A HOOP THE TRAY WAS KEPT FROM TUMBLING DOWN BY A BIBLE AND THE TRAY IF IT HAD TUMBLED DOWN
1846-144452-0019 WOULD HAVE SMASHED A QUANTITY OF CUPS AND SAUCERS AND A TEAPOT THAT WERE GROUPED AROUND THE BOOK ON THE WALLS THERE WERE SOME COMMON COLOURED PICTURES FRAMED AND GLAZED OF SCRIPTURE SUBJECTS SUCH AS I HAVE NEVER SEEN SINCE IN THE HANDS OF PEDLARS
1846-144452-0020 WITHOUT SEEING THE WHOLE INTERIOR OF PEGGOTTY'S BROTHER'S HOUSE AGAIN AT ONE VIEW ABRAHAM IN RED GOING TO SACRIFICE ISAAC IN BLUE AND DANIEL IN YELLOW CAST INTO A DEN OF GREEN LIONS WERE THE MOST PROMINENT OF THESE
1846-144452-0021 OVER THE LITTLE MANTELSHELF WAS A PICTURE OF THE SARAH JANE LUGGER BUILT AT SUNDERLAND WITH A REAL LITTLE WOODEN STERN STUCK ON TO
1846-144452-0022 THERE WERE SOME HOOKS IN THE BEAMS OF THE CEILING THE USE OF WHICH I DID NOT DIVINE THEN AND SOME LOCKERS AND BOXES AND CONVENIENCES OF THAT SORT WHICH SERVED FOR SEATS AND EKED OUT THE CHAIRS
1846-144452-0023 CHILD LIKE ACCORDING TO MY THEORY
1846-144452-0024 AND MOST DESIRABLE BEDROOM EVER SEEN IN THE STERN OF THE VESSEL WITH A LITTLE WINDOW WHERE THE RUDDER USED TO GO THROUGH A LITTLE LOOKING GLASS JUST THE RIGHT HEIGHT FOR ME NAILED AGAINST THE WALL AND FRAMED WITH OYSTER SHELLS A LITTLE BED
1846-144452-0025 AND A NOSEGAY OF SEAWEED IN A BLUE MUG ON THE TABLE THE WALLS WERE WHITEWASHED AS WHITE AS MILK AND THE PATCHWORK COUNTERPANE MADE MY EYES QUITE ACHE WITH ITS BRIGHTNESS
1846-144452-0026 ONE THING I PARTICULARLY NOTICED IN THIS DELIGHTFUL HOUSE WAS THE SMELL OF FISH WHICH WAS SO SEARCHING
1846-144452-0027 I FOUND IT SMELT EXACTLY AS IF IT HAD WRAPPED UP A LOBSTER ON MY IMPARTING THIS DISCOVERY IN CONFIDENCE TO PEGGOTTY SHE INFORMED ME THAT HER BROTHER DEALT IN LOBSTERS CRABS AND CRAWFISH
1846-144452-0028 WHOM I HAD SEEN CURTSEYING AT THE DOOR WHEN I WAS ON HAM'S BACK
1846-144452-0029 OR I THOUGHT HER SO WITH A NECKLACE OF BLUE BEADS ON WHO WOULDN'T LET ME KISS HER WHEN I OFFERED TO BUT RAN AWAY AND HID HERSELF BY AND BY WHEN WE HAD DINED IN A SUMPTUOUS MANNER OFF BOILED DABS MELTED BUTTER
1846-144452-0030 AND POTATOES WITH A CHOP FOR ME A HAIRY MAN WITH A VERY GOOD NATURED FACE CAME HOME AS HE CALLED PEGGOTTY LASS AND GAVE HER A HEARTY SMACK ON THE CHEEK I HAD NO DOUBT FROM THE GENERAL PROPRIETY OF HER CONDUCT
1846-144452-0031 THAT HE WAS HER BROTHER AND SO HE TURNED OUT BEING PRESENTLY INTRODUCED TO ME AS MISTER PEGGOTTY THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE GLAD TO SEE YOU SIR SAID MISTER PEGGOTTY YOU'LL FIND US ROUGH SIR BUT YOU'LL FIND US READY
1846-144452-0032 AND THAT SHE DESIRED HER COMPLIMENTS WHICH WAS A POLITE FICTION ON MY PART I'M MUCH OBLEEGED TO HER I'M SURE SAID MISTER PEGGOTTY WELL SIR IF YOU CAN MAKE OUT HERE FUR A FORTNUT
1846-144452-0033 REMARKING THAT COLD WOULD NEVER GET HIS MUCK OFF HE SOON RETURNED GREATLY IMPROVED IN APPEARANCE BUT SO RUBICUND THAT I COULDN'T HELP THINKING HIS FACE HAD THIS IN COMMON WITH THE LOBSTERS CRABS AND CRAWFISH
1846-144452-0034 THAT IT WENT INTO THE HOT WATER VERY BLACK AND CAME OUT VERY RED AFTER TEA WHEN THE DOOR WAS SHUT AND ALL WAS MADE SNUG THE NIGHTS BEING COLD AND MISTY NOW IT SEEMED TO ME THE MOST DELICIOUS RETREAT
1846-144452-0035 THAT THE IMAGINATION OF MAN COULD CONCEIVE TO HEAR THE WIND GETTING UP OUT AT SEA TO KNOW THAT THE FOG WAS CREEPING OVER THE DESOLATE FLAT OUTSIDE AND TO LOOK AT THE FIRE AND THINK THAT THERE WAS NO HOUSE NEAR BUT THIS ONE AND THIS ONE A BOAT
1846-144452-0036 WAS LIKE ENCHANTMENT LITTLE EM'LY HAD OVERCOME HER SHYNESS AND WAS SITTING BY MY SIDE UPON THE LOWEST AND LEAST OF THE LOCKERS WHICH WAS JUST LARGE ENOUGH FOR US TWO AND JUST FITTED INTO THE CHIMNEY CORNER
1846-144452-0037 MISSUS PEGGOTTY WITH THE WHITE APRON WAS KNITTING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE FIRE PEGGOTTY AT HER NEEDLEWORK WAS AS MUCH AT HOME WITH SAINT PAUL'S AND THE BIT OF WAX CANDLE AS IF THEY HAD NEVER KNOWN ANY OTHER ROOF HAM
1846-144452-0038 WHO HAD BEEN GIVING ME MY FIRST LESSON IN ALL FOURS WAS TRYING TO RECOLLECT A SCHEME OF TELLING FORTUNES WITH THE DIRTY CARDS
