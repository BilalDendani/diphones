4110-11533-0000 SOMEHOW HOWEVER COMMUNICATION IF SARKA THE SECOND HAD GUESSED CORRECTLY HAD BEEN MANAGED BETWEEN MARS AND THE MOON
4110-11533-0001 PERHAPS FOR THE SAME REASON THAT THE EARTH HAD GONE A VOYAGING SIDE BY SIDE SAT SARKA AND JASKA
4110-11533-0002 GROWING MINUTE BY MINUTE LARGER THEY WERE ABLE AFTER SOME HOURS TO MAKE OUT THE OUTLINES OF WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN CONTINENTS TO SEE THE SHADOWS IN VALLEYS WHICH HAD ONCE HELD THE OCEANS OF EARTH
4110-11533-0003 AND ALWAYS AS THEY STARED AND LITERALLY WILLED THE CUBES WHICH PILOTED AND WERE THE MOTIVE POWER OF THE AIRCARS TO SPEED AND MORE SPEED THAT MARVELOUS DISPLAY OF INTERPLANETARY FIREWORKS
4110-11533-0004 WHICH HAD AROUSED THE CONCERN OF SARKA THE SECOND WHAT WERE THOSE LIGHTS WHENCE DID THEY EMANATE SARKA THE SECOND HAD SAID THAT THEY CAME FROM MARS YET MARS WAS INVISIBLE TO THOSE IN THE SPEEDING AIRCARS
4110-11533-0005 WHICH ARGUED THAT IT WAS HIDDEN BEHIND THE EARTH THERE WAS
4110-11533-0006 TO THE EFFECT THAT LUAR FOR ALL HER SOVEREIGNTY OF THE MOON MIGHT BE NONETHELESS A NATIVE OF THE EARTH BUT HOW WHY WHEN THERE WERE NO ANSWERS TO ANY OF THE QUESTIONS YET
4110-11533-0007 IF SHE WERE A NATIVE OF EARTH HOW HAD SHE REACHED THE MOON WHEN HAD SHE BEEN SENT THERE WHO WAS SHE HER NAME LUAR WAS A STRANGE ONE AND SARKA STUDIED IT FOR MANY MINUTES ROLLING THE ODD SYLLABLES OF IT OVER HIS TONGUE
4110-11533-0008 WONDERING WHERE ON THE EARTH HE HAD HEARD NAMES OR WORDS SIMILAR TO IT THIS PRODUCED NO RESULT UNTIL HE TRIED SUBSTITUTING VARIOUS LETTERS THEN AGAIN ADDING VARIOUS LETTERS
4110-11533-0009 WHEN HE ACHIEVED A CERTAIN RESULT AT LAST HE GASPED AND HIS BRAIN WAS A WHIRL LUAR BY THE ADDITION OF THE LETTER N
4110-11533-0010 MEANING OF THE MOON YET LUNAR WAS UNMISTAKABLY A WORD DERIVED FROM THE LANGUAGE OF THE EARTH IT WAS POSSIBLE OF COURSE THAT THIS WAS MERE COINCIDENCE BUT TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUSPICIONS OF JASKA
4110-11533-0011 AND THE INCONTROVERTIBLE FACT THAT LUAR RESEMBLED PEOPLE OF THE EARTH
4110-11533-0012 WHO WAS LUAR HIS MIND WENT BACK TO THE CLUCKING SOUNDS WHICH AMONG THE GNOMES OF THE MOON PASSED FOR SPEECH HE PONDERED ANEW HE SHAPED HIS LIPS AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THE CLUCKING SOUNDS HE HAD HEARD
4110-11533-0013 AND DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THE LETTER N THE CONCLUSION WAS INESCAPABLE THIS WOMAN LUAR
4110-11533-0014 THE N DOWN THE CENTURIES BEING DROPPED BECAUSE DIFFICULT FOR THE GNOMES TO PRONOUNCE YES JASKA HE SAID SUDDENLY SOMEWHERE ON EARTH WHEN WE REACH IT WE MAY DISCOVER THE SECRET OF LUAR
4110-11533-0015 JASKA MERELY SMILED HER INSCRUTABLE SMILE AND DID NOT ANSWER BY INTUITION SHE ALREADY KNEW LET SARKA ARRIVE AT HER CONCLUSION BY SCIENTIFIC METHODS IF HE DESIRED AND SHE WOULD SIMPLY SMILE ANEW
4110-11533-0016 AND STILL THE ONE QUESTION REMAINED UNANSWERED WHO WAS LUAR THE EARTH WAS NOW SO CLOSE THAT DETAILS WERE PLAINLY SEEN THE HIMALAYAS WERE OUT OF SIGHT OVER THE EARTH
4110-11533-0017 AND BY A MENTAL COMMAND SARKA MANAGED TO CHANGE SLIGHTLY THE COURSE OF THE DOZEN AIRCARS
4110-11533-0018 HE HOPED ALSO TO SEE FROM ABOVE SOMETHING OF THE RESULT OF THE STRANGE AERIAL BOMBARDMENT OF WHICH HIS FATHER HAD SPOKEN IN THEIR FLIGHT WHICH HAD BEEN TO THEM A FLIGHT THROUGH THE GLORIES OF A SUPER HEAVENLY UNIVERSE THEY HAD LOST ALL COUNT OF TIME
4110-11533-0019 NOR YET THE PEOPLE IN THOSE OTHER AIRCARS COULD HAVE TOLD HOW LONG THEY HAD BEEN FLYING WHEN COMING OVER THE CURVE OF THE EARTH AT AN ELEVATION OF SOMETHING LIKE THREE MILES THEY WERE ABLE AT LAST
4110-11533-0020 TO SEE INTO THE AREA WHICH HAD ONCE HOUSED THE GENS OF DALIS
4110-11533-0021 THE GENS OF DALIS HAD OCCUPIED ALL THE TERRITORY NORTHWARD TO THE POLE FROM A LINE DRAWN EAST AND WEST THROUGH THE SOUTHERNMOST OF WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS UPON THIS AREA HAD STRUCK THE STRANGE BLUE LIGHT FROM THE DEEP CONE OF THE MOON
4110-11533-0022 HERE HOWEVER THE LIGHT WAS INVISIBLE AND SARKA FLEW ON IN FEAR THAT SOMEHOW HIS AIRCARS WOULD BLUNDER INTO IT AND BE DESTROYED FOR THAT THE BLUE LIGHT WAS AN AGENT OF GHASTLY DESTRUCTION
4110-11533-0023 BECAME INSTANTLY APPARENT THE DWELLINGS OF THE GENS OF DALIS WERE BROKEN AND SMASHED INTO CHAOTIC RUINS
4110-11533-0024 THE BLIND GODS OF DESTRUCTION HAD PRACTICALLY MADE A CLEAN SWEEP SARKA HAD OPPORTUNITY TO THANK GOD THAT AT THE TIME THE BLUE COLUMN HAD STRUCK THE EARTH IT HAD STRUCK AT THE SPOT WHICH HAD BEEN ALMOST EMPTIED OF PEOPLE
4110-11533-0025 AND REALIZED THAT BLIND CHANCE HAD CAUSED IT FOR IN ORDER FOR THE GENS OF DALIS TO BE IN POSITION TO LAUNCH THEIR ATTACK AGAINST THE MOON HE HAD MANAGED BY MANIPULATING THE SPEED OF THE BERYLS
4110-11533-0026 THINK OF A SHORELINE ONCE LINED WITH MIGHTY BUILDINGS AFTER THE PASSAGE OF A TIDAL WAVE GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE KNOWN TO MAN THE DEVASTATION WOULD BE INDESCRIBABLE
4110-11533-0027 AND THE MENTAL PICTURE IS ALMOST TOO BIG TO GRASP CHAOS CATASTROPHE APPROACHING AN INFINITY OF DESTRUCTION
4110-11533-0028 HAD BEEN TWISTED INTO GROTESQUE NIGHTMARISH SHAPES AND THE WHOLE FUSED INTO A BURNED AND GLEAMING MASS WHICH COVERED HALF OF WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN A MIGHTY OCEAN
4110-11533-0029 YET SARKA KNEW REMEMBERING THE MURMURING OF THE BLUE COLUMN AS IT CAME OUT OF THE CONE ALL THIS DEVASTATION HAD BEEN CAUSED IN ALMOST ABSOLUTE SILENCE
4110-11533-0030 SARKA SHUDDERED TRYING TO PICTURE IN HIS MIND THE MASSING OF THE MINIONS OF MARS WHO THUS SAW A NEW COUNTRY GIVEN INTO THEIR HANDS IF THEY COULD TAKE IT HAD THE EARTH BEEN TAKEN BY SURPRISE
4110-11533-0031 FATHER HE SENT HIS THOUGHTS RACING ON AHEAD OF HIM ARE THOSE LIGHTS WHICH ARE STRIKING THE EARTH CAUSING ANY DAMAGE ONLY CAME BACK THE INSTANT ANSWER IN THAT THEY DESTROY THE COURAGE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE EARTH
4110-11533-0032 THE PEOPLE HOWEVER NOW KNOW THAT SARKA IS RETURNING AND THEIR COURAGE RISES AGAIN THE FLAMES ARE MERELY A HINT OF WHAT FACES US BUT THE PEOPLE WILL RISE AND FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU LEAD
4110-11533-0033 SO AS THEY RACED ACROSS THE AREA OF DEVASTATION THE FACE OF SARKA BECAME CALM AGAIN ON A CHANCE HE SENT A SINGLE SENTENCE OF STRANGE MEANING TO HIS FATHER
4110-11533-0034 THE RULER OF THE MOON IS A WOMAN CALLED LUAR WHICH SEEMS A CONTRACTION OF LUNAR FOR MANY MINUTES SARKA THE SECOND MADE NO ANSWER
