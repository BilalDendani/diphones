4800-73728-0000 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO JUSTICE TO THE TENDER SOLICITUDE WITH WHICH HE MADE ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE JOURNEY WHEREVER THEY HALTED THEY FOUND PREPARATIONS FOR THEIR RECEPTION AND SO ADMIRABLY HAD EVERYTHING BEEN CONCERTED
4800-73728-0001 THAT MISS TEMPLE AT LENGTH FOUND HERSELF IN THE ETERNAL CITY WITH ALMOST AS LITTLE FATIGUE AS SHE HAD REACHED THE TUSCAN VILLA THE PALACE OF LORD MONTFORT WAS IN THE MOST DISTINGUISHED QUARTER OF THE CITY
4800-73728-0002 AND SITUATE IN THE MIDST OF VAST GARDENS FULL OF WALLS OF LAUREL
4800-73728-0003 THEY ARRIVED AT TWILIGHT AND THE SHADOWY HOUR LENT EVEN ADDITIONAL SPACE TO THE HUGE HALLS AND GALLERIES YET IN THE SUITE OF ROOMS INTENDED FOR MISTER TEMPLE AND HIS DAUGHTER EVERY SOURCE OF COMFORT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN COLLECTED
4800-73728-0004 THE MARBLE FLOORS WERE COVERED WITH INDIAN MATS AND CARPETS THE WINDOWS WERE WELL SECURED FROM THE AIR WHICH MIGHT HAVE PROVED FATAL TO AN INVALID WHILE EVERY SPECIES OF CHAIR AND COUCH AND SOFA
4800-73728-0005 COURTED THE LANGUID OR CAPRICIOUS FORM OF MISS TEMPLE AND SHE WAS EVEN FAVOURED WITH AN ENGLISH STOVE AND GUARDED BY AN INDIAN SCREEN THE APARTMENTS WERE SUPPLIED WITH EVERY BOOK WHICH IT COULD HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED MIGHT AMUSE HER
4800-73728-0006 THERE WERE GUITARS OF THE CITY AND OF FLORENCE AND EVEN AN ENGLISH PIANO A LIBRARY OF THE CHOICEST MUSIC AND ALL THE MATERIALS OF ART
4800-73728-0007 THE AIR OF ELEGANCE AND CHEERFUL COMFORT THAT PERVADED THESE APARTMENTS SO UNUSUAL IN THIS LAND THE BRIGHT BLAZE OF THE FIRE
4800-73728-0008 WHICH ATTENDS AN ARRIVAL AT A STRANGE PLACE AT A LATE HOUR
4800-73728-0009 PRESENTED TO THEM THE SERVANT WHO WAS TO ASSUME THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSEHOLD AND THEN REMINDING THEM OF THEIR MUTUAL PROMISES THAT THEY WERE TO BE ENTIRELY THEIR OWN MASTERS AND NOT TROUBLE THEMSELVES ABOUT HIM ANY MORE THAN IF THEY WERE AT PISA
4800-73728-0010 HE SHOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND BADE THEM GOOD NIGHT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THE ACQUAINTANCE OF LORD MONTFORT HAD AFFORDED CONSOLATION TO HENRIETTA TEMPLE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE INSENSIBLE TO THE SYMPATHY AND SOLICITUDE
4800-73728-0011 OF ONE SO HIGHLY GIFTED AND SO VERY AMIABLE NOR SHOULD IT BE DENIED THAT THIS HOMAGE FROM ONE OF HIS DISTINGUISHED RANK WAS ENTIRELY WITHOUT ITS CHARM TO FIND OURSELVES WHEN DECEIVED AND DESERTED
4800-73728-0012 UNEXPECTEDLY AN OBJECT OF REGARD AND CONSIDERATION WILL BRING BALM TO MOST BOSOMS BUT TO ATTRACT IN SUCH A SITUATION THE FRIENDSHIP OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHOSE DEFERENTIAL NOTICE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES MUST BE FLATTERING
4800-73728-0013 AND TO BE ADMIRED BY ONE WHOM ALL ADMIRE THESE ARE ACCIDENTS OF FORTUNE WHICH FEW COULD VENTURE TO DESPISE AND HENRIETTA HAD NOW FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO BROOD OVER THE PAST
4800-73728-0014 SHE SAW BEFORE HER ALL THAT SHE HAD LONG READ OF ALL THAT SHE HAD LONG MUSED OVER HER MIND BECAME EACH DAY MORE SERENE AND HARMONIOUS AS SHE GAZED ON THESE IDEAL CREATIONS AND DWELT ON THEIR BEAUTIFUL REPOSE
4800-73728-0015 HER COMPANION TOO EXERTED EVERY ART TO PREVENT THESE AMUSEMENTS FROM DEGENERATING INTO FATIGUING EXPEDITIONS THE VATICAN WAS OPEN TO LORD MONTFORT WHEN IT WAS OPEN TO NONE OTHERS SHORT VISITS
4800-73728-0016 WHERE THEIR ENTRANCE ALWAYS MADE THE SCULPTOR'S EYES SPARKLE AT DINNER THERE WAS ALWAYS SOME DISTINGUISHED GUEST WHOM HENRIETTA WISHED TO SEE AND AS SHE THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD THE LANGUAGE AND SPOKE IT WITH FLUENCY AND GRACE
4800-73728-0017 SHE WAS TEMPTED TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATIONS WHERE ALL SEEMED DELIGHTED THAT SHE PLAYED HER PART SOMETIMES INDEED HENRIETTA WOULD FLY TO HER CHAMBER TO SIGH BUT SUDDENLY THE PALACE RESOUNDED WITH TONES OF THE FINEST HARMONY
4800-73728-0018 OR THE HUMAN VOICE WITH ITS MOST FELICITOUS SKILL STOLE UPON HER FROM THE DISTANT GALLERIES ALTHOUGH LORD MONTFORT WAS NOT HIMSELF A MUSICIAN
4800-73728-0019 AND HIS VOICE COULD NOT POUR FORTH THOSE FATAL SOUNDS THAT HAD RAVISHED HER SOUL FROM THE LIPS OF FERDINAND ARMINE HE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE MAGIC OF MUSIC AND WHILE HE HATED A FORMAL CONCERT
4800-73728-0020 THE MOST EMINENT PERFORMERS WERE OFTEN AT HAND IN HIS PALACE TO CONTRIBUTE AT THE FITTING MOMENT TO THE DELIGHT OF HIS GUESTS WHO COULD WITHSTAND THE SOFT INFLUENCE OF A LIFE SO ELEGANT AND SERENE
4800-73728-0021 THE SUNSHINE OF HER SMILE BURST FORTH ONCE MORE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR AN INDIFFERENT PERSON NOT TO PERCEIVE THAT LORD MONTFORT WITNESSED THESE CHANGES WITH FEELINGS OF NO SLIGHT EMOTION
4800-73728-0022 WAS NOT AWARE THAT LORD MONTFORT'S DEMEANOUR TO HER DIFFERED IN ANY DEGREE FROM WHAT IT WAS AT PISA SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ALONE WITH HIM IN HER LIFE
4800-73728-0023 BUT THEN SHE SPOKE MORE TO EVERYBODY AND LORD MONTFORT CERTAINLY SEEMED TO THINK OF NOTHING BUT HER PLEASURE AND CONVENIENCE AND COMFORT BUT HE DID AND SAID EVERYTHING SO QUIETLY THAT ALL THIS KINDNESS AND SOLICITUDE
4800-73728-0024 APPEARED TO BE THE HABITUAL IMPULSE OF HIS GENEROUS NATURE HE CERTAINLY WAS MORE INTIMATE MUCH MORE INTIMATE THAN DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE BUT SCARCELY MORE KIND FOR SHE REMEMBERED HE HAD ARRANGED HER SOFA THE VERY FIRST DAY THEY MET
4800-73728-0025 ONE DAY A DISCUSSION ROSE ABOUT ITALIAN SOCIETY BETWEEN MISTER TEMPLE AND HIS HOST HIS LORDSHIP WAS A GREAT ADMIRER OF THE DOMESTIC CHARACTER AND PRIVATE LIFE OF THE ITALIANS
4800-73728-0026 HE MAINTAINED THAT THERE WAS NO EXISTING PEOPLE WHO MORE COMPLETELY FULFILLED THE SOCIAL DUTIES THAN THIS MUCH SCANDALISED NATION RESPECTING WHOM SO MANY SILLY PREJUDICES ARE ENTERTAINED BY THE ENGLISH WHOSE TRAVELLING FELLOW COUNTRYMEN BY THE BYE
4800-73728-0027 BUT THAT TAINTED CIRCLE THAT MUST EXIST IN ALL CAPITALS YOU HAVE NO IDEA HE SAID TURNING TO HENRIETTA WHAT AMIABLE AND ACCOMPLISHED PEOPLE ARE THE BETTER ORDER OF ITALIANS
4800-73728-0028 I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME LIGHT UP THIS DARK HOUSE SOME NIGHT AND GIVE YOU AN ITALIAN PARTY I SHOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH SAID MISTER TEMPLE WHENEVER HENRIETTA DID NOT ENTER HER NEGATIVE LORD MONTFORT ALWAYS IMPLIED HER ASSENT
4800-73728-0029 AND IT WAS RESOLVED THAT THE ITALIAN PARTY SHOULD BE GIVEN ALL THE BEST FAMILIES IN ROME WERE PRESENT AND NOT A SINGLE ENGLISH PERSON THERE WERE SOME PERHAPS WHOM LORD MONTFORT MIGHT HAVE WISHED TO INVITE
4800-73728-0030 BUT MISS TEMPLE HAD CHANCED TO EXPRESS A WISH THAT NO ENGLISH MIGHT BE THERE AND HE INSTANTLY ACTED UPON HER SUGGESTION THE PALACE WAS MAGNIFICENTLY ILLUMINATED
4800-73728-0031 HENRIETTA HAD SCARCELY SEEN BEFORE ITS SPLENDID TREASURES OF ART LORD MONTFORT IN ANSWER TO HER CURIOSITY HAD ALWAYS PLAYFULLY DEPRECIATED THEM AND SAID THAT THEY MUST BE LEFT FOR RAINY DAYS
4800-73728-0032 THE MOST SPLENDID PICTURES AND LONG ROWS OF GRACEFUL OR SOLEMN STATUES WERE SUDDENLY REVEALED TO HER ROOMS AND GALLERIES WERE OPENED THAT HAD NEVER BEEN OBSERVED BEFORE ON ALL SIDES CABINETS OF VASES
4800-73728-0033 GROUPS OF IMPERIAL BUSTS RARE BRONZES AND VIVID MASSES OF TESSELATED PAVEMENT OVER ALL THESE CHOICE AND BEAUTIFUL OBJECTS A CLEAR YET SOFT LIGHT WAS DIFFUSED
4800-73728-0034 AND HENRIETTA NEVER RECOLLECTED A SPECTACLE MORE COMPLETE AND EFFECTIVE THESE ROOMS AND GALLERIES WERE SOON FILLED WITH GUESTS AND HENRIETTA COULD NOT BE INSENSIBLE TO THE GRACEFUL AND ENGAGING DIGNITY
4800-73728-0035 WITH WHICH LORD MONTFORT RECEIVED THE ROMAN WORLD OF FASHION THAT CONSTRAINT WHICH AT FIRST SHE HAD ATTRIBUTED TO RESERVE BUT WHICH OF LATE SHE HAD ASCRIBED TO MODESTY NOW ENTIRELY QUITTED HIM FRANK
4800-73728-0036 I WOULD NOT ASK THIS FAVOUR OF YOU UNLESS I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE PLEASED HENRIETTA COULD NOT REFUSE HIS REQUEST LORD MONTFORT PRESENTED HER AND HER FATHER TO THE PRINCESS THE MOST AGREEABLE AND IMPORTANT PERSON IN ROME
4800-73728-0037 AND HAVING NOW PROVIDED FOR THEIR IMMEDIATE AMUSEMENT HE HAD TIME TO ATTEND TO HIS GUESTS IN GENERAL AN ADMIRABLE CONCERT NOW IN SOME DEGREE HUSHED THE GENERAL CONVERSATION THE VOICES OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN IN ROME
4800-73728-0038 WHEN THE MUSIC CEASED THE GUESTS WANDERED ABOUT THE GALLERIES AND AT LENGTH THE PRINCIPAL SALOONS WERE FILLED WITH DANCERS LORD MONTFORT APPROACHED MISS TEMPLE THERE IS ONE ROOM IN THE PALACE YOU HAVE NEVER YET VISITED HE SAID
4800-73728-0039 MY TRIBUNE TIS OPEN TO NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME HENRIETTA ACCEPTED HIS PROFFERED ARM AND HOW DO YOU LIKE THE PRINCESS HE SAID AS THEY WALKED ALONG IT IS AGREEABLE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE YOUR GUESTS AMUSE THEMSELVES
4800-73728-0040 AT THE END OF THE PRINCIPAL GALLERY HENRIETTA PERCEIVED AN OPEN DOOR WHICH ADMITTED THEM INTO A SMALL OCTAGON CHAMBER OF IONIC ARCHITECTURE THE WALLS WERE NOT HUNG WITH PICTURES
4800-73728-0041 AND ONE WORK OF ART ALONE SOLICITED THEIR ATTENTION ELEVATED ON A PEDESTAL OF PORPHYRY SURROUNDED BY A RAIL OF BRONZE ARROWS OF THE LIGHTEST WORKMANSHIP WAS THAT STATUE OF DIANA WHICH THEY HAD SO MUCH ADMIRED AT PISA
4800-73728-0042 THE CHEEK BY AN ANCIENT PROCESS THE SECRET OF WHICH HAS BEEN RECENTLY REGAINED AT ROME WAS TINTED WITH A DELICATE GLOW DO YOU APPROVE OF IT SAID LORD MONTFORT TO THE ADMIRING HENRIETTA
