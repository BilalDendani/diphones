263-121285-0000 THE PENGUIN CRITICS VIE WITH ONE ANOTHER IN AFFIRMING THAT PENGUIN ART HAS FROM ITS ORIGIN BEEN DISTINGUISHED BY A POWERFUL AND PLEASING ORIGINALITY AND THAT WE MAY LOOK ELSEWHERE IN VAIN FOR THE QUALITIES OF GRACE AND REASON THAT CHARACTERISE ITS EARLIEST WORKS
263-121285-0001 BUT THE PORPOISES CLAIM THAT THEIR ARTISTS WERE UNDOUBTEDLY THE INSTRUCTORS AND MASTERS OF THE PENGUINS IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORM AN OPINION ON THE MATTER BECAUSE THE PENGUINS BEFORE THEY BEGAN TO ADMIRE THEIR PRIMITIVE PAINTERS DESTROYED ALL THEIR WORKS
263-121285-0002 WE CANNOT BE TOO SORRY FOR THIS LOSS FOR MY OWN PART I FEEL IT CRUELLY FOR I VENERATE THE PENGUIN ANTIQUITIES AND I ADORE THE PRIMITIVES THEY ARE DELIGHTFUL I DO NOT SAY THE ARE ALL ALIKE FOR THAT WOULD BE UNTRUE
263-121285-0003 BUT THEY HAVE COMMON CHARACTERS THAT ARE FOUND IN ALL SCHOOLS I MEAN FORMULAS FROM WHICH THEY NEVER DEPART AND THERE IS BESIDES SOMETHING FINISHED IN THEIR WORK FOR WHAT THEY KNOW THEY KNOW WELL LUCKILY
263-121285-0004 WE CAN FORM A NOTION OF THE PENGUIN PRIMITIVES FROM THE ITALIAN FLEMISH AND DUTCH PRIMITIVES AND FROM THE FRENCH PRIMITIVES WHO ARE SUPERIOR TO ALL THE REST
263-121285-0005 LOGIC BEING A PECULIARLY FRENCH QUALITY EVEN IF THIS IS DENIED IT MUST AT LEAST BE ADMITTED THAT TO FRANCE BELONGS THE CREDIT OF HAVING KEPT PRIMITIVES WHEN THE OTHER NATIONS KNEW THEM NO LONGER
263-121285-0006 THE EXHIBITION OF FRENCH PRIMITIVES AT THE PAVILION MARSAN IN NINETEEN O FOUR CONTAINED SEVERAL LITTLE PANELS CONTEMPORARY WITH THE LATER VALOIS KINGS
263-121285-0007 OF MEMLING OF ROGER VAN DER WEYDEN OF THE PAINTER OF THE DEATH OF MARY OF AMBROGIO LORENZETTI AND OF THE OLD UMBRIAN MASTERS
263-121285-0008 NOR PERUGIA THAT COMPLETED MY INITIATION
263-121285-0009 THAT WAS TEN YEARS AGO OR EVEN LONGER AT THAT PERIOD OF INDIGENCE AND SIMPLICITY THE MUNICIPAL MUSEUMS THOUGH USUALLY KEPT SHUT WERE ALWAYS OPENED TO FOREIGNERS ONE EVENING AN OLD WOMAN WITH A CANDLE SHOWED ME FOR HALF A LIRA
263-121285-0010 AND IN IT I DISCOVERED A PAINTING BY MARGARITONE A SAINT FRANCIS THE PIOUS SADNESS OF WHICH MOVED ME TO TEARS I WAS DEEPLY TOUCHED
263-121285-0011 I PICTURE TO MYSELF THE PENGUIN PRIMITIVES IN CONFORMITY WITH THE WORKS OF THAT MASTER IT WILL NOT THEREFORE BE THOUGHT SUPERFLUOUS IF IN THIS PLACE I CONSIDER HIS WORKS WITH SOME ATTENTION IF NOT IN DETAIL AT LEAST UNDER THEIR MORE GENERAL AND
263-121285-0012 IF I DARE SAY SO MOST REPRESENTATIVE ASPECT WE POSSESS FIVE OR SIX PICTURES SIGNED WITH HIS HAND HIS MASTERPIECE PRESERVED IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF LONDON REPRESENTS THE VIRGIN SEATED ON A THRONE
263-121285-0013 AND HOLDING THE INFANT JESUS IN HER ARMS WHAT STRIKES ONE FIRST WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THIS FIGURE IS THE PROPORTION THE BODY FROM THE NECK TO THE FEET IS ONLY TWICE AS LONG AS THE HEAD SO THAT IT APPEARS EXTREMELY SHORT AND PODGY
263-121285-0014 AND HE USED THEM IN ALL THEIR PURITY WITHOUT EVER MODIFYING THE TONES FROM THIS IT FOLLOWS THAT HIS COLOURING HAS MORE VIVACITY THAN HARMONY THE CHEEKS OF THE VIRGIN AND THOSE OF THE CHILD ARE OF A BRIGHT VERMILION
263-121285-0015 WHICH THE OLD MASTER FROM A NAIVE PREFERENCE FOR CLEAR DEFINITIONS HAS PLACED ON EACH FACE IN TWO CIRCUMFERENCES AS EXACT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN TRACED OUT BY A PAIR OF COMPASSES A LEARNED CRITIC OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE ABBE LANZI
263-121285-0016 HAS TREATED MARGARITONE'S WORKS WITH PROFOUND DISDAIN THEY ARE HE SAYS MERELY CRUDE DAUBS IN THOSE UNFORTUNATE TIMES PEOPLE COULD NEITHER DRAW NOR PAINT SUCH WAS THE COMMON OPINION OF THE CONNOISSEURS OF THE DAYS OF POWDERED WIGS
263-121285-0017 AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES WERE SOON TO BE AVENGED FOR THIS CRUEL CONTEMPT THERE WAS BORN IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN THE BIBLICAL VILLAGES AND REFORMED COTTAGES OF PIOUS ENGLAND A MULTITUDE OF LITTLE SAMUELS AND LITTLE SAINT JOHNS WITH HAIR CURLING LIKE LAMBS
263-121285-0018 WHO ABOUT EIGHTEEN FORTY AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY BECAME SPECTACLED PROFESSORS AND FOUNDED THE CULT OF THE PRIMITIVES
263-121285-0019 DOES NOT SHRINK FROM PLACING THE MADONNA OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY ON A LEVEL WITH THE MASTERPIECES OF CHRISTIAN ART BY GIVING TO THE VIRGIN'S HEAD SAYS SIR JAMES TUCKETT A THIRD OF THE TOTAL HEIGHT OF THE FIGURE
263-121285-0020 THE OLD MASTER ATTRACTS THE SPECTATOR'S ATTENTION AND KEEPS IT DIRECTED TOWARDS THE MORE SUBLIME PARTS OF THE HUMAN FIGURE AND IN PARTICULAR THE EYES WHICH WE ORDINARILY DESCRIBE AS THE SPIRITUAL ORGANS IN THIS PICTURE
263-121285-0021 COLOURING AND DESIGN CONSPIRE TO PRODUCE AN IDEAL AND MYSTICAL IMPRESSION THE VERMILION OF THE CHEEKS DOES NOT RECALL THE NATURAL APPEARANCE OF THE SKIN IT RATHER SEEMS AS IF THE OLD MASTER HAS APPLIED THE ROSES OF PARADISE TO THE FACES OF THE MOTHER
263-121285-0022 AND THE CHILD WE SEE IN SUCH A CRITICISM AS THIS A SHINING REFLECTION SO TO SPEAK OF THE WORK WHICH IT EXALTS YET MAC SILLY THE SERAPHIC AESTHETE OF EDINBURGH HAS EXPRESSED IN A STILL MORE MOVING AND PENETRATING FASHION
263-121285-0023 THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED UPON HIS MIND BY THE SIGHT OF THIS PRIMITIVE PAINTING
263-121285-0024 SAYS THE REVERED MAC SILLY ATTAINS THE TRANSCENDENT END OF ART IT INSPIRES ITS BEHOLDERS WITH FEELINGS OF INNOCENCE AND PURITY IT MAKES THEM LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN AND SO TRUE IS THIS THAT AT THE AGE OF SIXTY SIX
263-121285-0025 AFTER HAVING HAD THE JOY OF CONTEMPLATING IT CLOSELY FOR THREE HOURS I FELT MYSELF SUDDENLY TRANSFORMED INTO A LITTLE CHILD WHILE MY CAB WAS TAKING ME THROUGH TRAFALGAR SQUARE I KEPT LAUGHING AND PRATTLING AND SHAKING MY SPECTACLE CASE AS IF IT WERE A RATTLE
263-121285-0026 AND WHEN THE MAID IN MY BOARDING HOUSE HAD SERVED MY MEAL I KEPT POURING SPOONFULS OF SOUP INTO MY EAR WITH ALL THE ARTLESSNESS OF CHILDHOOD IT IS BY SUCH RESULTS ADDS MAC SILLY THAT THE EXCELLENCE OF A WORK OF ART IS PROVED
263-121285-0027 REGRETTING THAT HE HAD LIVED TO SEE A NEW FORM OF ART ARISING AND THE NEW ARTISTS CROWNED WITH FAME THESE LINES WHICH I TRANSLATE LITERALLY HAVE INSPIRED SIR JAMES TUCKETT WITH WHAT ARE PERHAPS THE FINEST PAGES IN HIS WORK
263-121285-0028 THEY FORM PART OF HIS BREVIARY FOR AESTHETES ALL THE PRE RAPHAELITES KNOW THEM BY HEART I PLACE THEM HERE AS THE MOST PRECIOUS ORNAMENT OF THIS BOOK YOU WILL AGREE THAT NOTHING MORE SUBLIME HAS BEEN WRITTEN SINCE THE DAYS OF THE HEBREW PROPHETS
263-121285-0029 MARGARITONE'S VISION
263-121285-0030 HE NOTICED IN THE STUDIO A FRESHLY PAINTED MADONNA WHICH ALTHOUGH SEVERE AND RIGID NEVERTHELESS BY A CERTAIN EXACTNESS IN THE PROPORTIONS AND A DEVILISH MINGLING OF LIGHT AND SHADE ASSUMED AN APPEARANCE OF RELIEF AND LIFE
263-121285-0031 WITH HIS BROW CLASPED IN HIS HANDS HE EXCLAIMED
263-121285-0032 SAINT MARTHA A BELLY SAINT BARBARA HIPS
263-121285-0033 AND SAINT GEORGE WILL DISPLAY BENEATH HIS ARMOUR THE MUSCULAR WEALTH OF A ROBUST VIRILITY
263-121285-0034 THE ANGELS WILL AFFECT AN EQUIVOCAL AMBIGUOUS MYSTERIOUS BEAUTY WHICH WILL TROUBLE HEARTS WHAT DESIRE FOR HEAVEN WILL THESE REPRESENTATIONS IMPART NONE
263-121285-0035 BUT FROM THEM YOU WILL LEARN TO TAKE PLEASURE IN THE FORMS OF TERRESTRIAL LIFE WHERE WILL PAINTERS STOP IN THEIR INDISCREET INQUIRIES THEY WILL STOP NOWHERE THEY WILL GO SO FAR AS TO SHOW MEN AND WOMEN NAKED
263-121285-0036 LIKE THE IDOLS OF THE ROMANS THERE WILL BE A SACRED ART AND A PROFANE ART AND THE SACRED ART WILL NOT BE LESS PROFANE THAN THE OTHER
263-121285-0037 EXCLAIMED THE OLD MASTER FOR IN PROPHETIC VISION HE SAW THE RIGHTEOUS AND THE SAINTS ASSUMING THE APPEARANCE OF MELANCHOLY ATHLETES
263-121285-0038 IN THE MIDST OF THE MUSES WEARING LIGHT TUNICS HE SAW VENUSES LYING UNDER SHADY MYRTLES AND THE DANAE EXPOSING THEIR CHARMING SIDES TO THE GOLDEN RAIN HE SAW PICTURES OF JESUS UNDER THE PILLAR'S OF THE TEMPLE
263-121285-0039 AMIDST PATRICIANS FAIR LADIES MUSICIANS PAGES NEGROES DOGS AND PARROTS HE SAW IN AN INEXTRICABLE CONFUSION OF HUMAN LIMBS OUTSPREAD WINGS AND FLYING DRAPERIES
263-121285-0040 CROWDS OF TUMULTUOUS NATIVITIES OPULENT HOLY FAMILIES EMPHATIC CRUCIFIXIONS
