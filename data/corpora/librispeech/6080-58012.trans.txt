6080-58012-0000 CHAPTER ONE GRADUATION DAY IN THE YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY THE STUDENT AND THE STATESMAN SAW MANY INDICATIONS THAT THE SOCIAL FINANCIAL
6080-58012-0001 AND INDUSTRIAL TROUBLES THAT HAD VEXED THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR SO LONG A TIME WERE ABOUT TO CULMINATE IN CIVIL WAR WEALTH HAD GROWN SO STRONG THAT THE FEW WERE ABOUT TO STRANGLE THE MANY
6080-58012-0002 AND AMONG THE GREAT MASSES OF THE PEOPLE THERE WAS SULLEN AND REBELLIOUS DISCONTENT THE LABORER IN THE CITIES THE PRODUCER ON THE FARM THE MERCHANT THE PROFESSIONAL MAN AND ALL SAVE ORGANIZED CAPITAL AND ITS SATELLITES
6080-58012-0003 SAW A GLOOMY AND HOPELESS FUTURE WITH THESE CONDITIONS PREVAILING THE GRADUATION EXERCISES OF THE CLASS OF NINETEEN TWENTY OF THE NATIONAL MILITARY ACADEMY AT WEST POINT HELD FOR MANY A FOREBODING PROMISE OF MOMENTOUS CHANGES
6080-58012-0004 BUT THE TWELFTH OF JUNE FOUND THE USUAL GAY SCENE AT THE GREAT INSTITUTION OVERLOOKING THE HUDSON THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC HIS SECRETARY OF WAR AND MANY OTHER DISTINGUISHED GUESTS WERE THERE TO DO HONOR TO THE OCCASION TOGETHER WITH FRIENDS
6080-58012-0005 RELATIVES AND ADMIRERS OF THE YOUNG MEN WHO WERE BEING SENT OUT TO THE ULTIMATE LEADERSHIP OF THE NATION'S ARMY THE SCENE HAD ALL THE USUAL CHARM OF WEST POINT GRADUATIONS AND THE USUAL INTOXICATING ATMOSPHERE OF MILITARY DISPLAY
6080-58012-0006 THERE WAS AMONG THE YOUNG GRADUATING SOLDIERS ONE WHO SEEMED DEPRESSED AND OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE TRIUMPHANT BLARE OF MILITARISM FOR HE ALONE OF HIS FELLOW CLASSMEN HAD THERE NO KITH NOR KIN TO BID HIM GOD SPEED IN HIS NEW CAREER
6080-58012-0007 HE SAW THE GLEAMING BROOK THAT WOUND ITS WAY THROUGH THE TANGLE OF ORCHARD AND GARDEN AND PARTED THE DISTANT BLUE GRASS MEADOW HE SAW HIS AGED MOTHER SITTING UNDER THE HONEYSUCKLE TRELLIS BOOK IN HAND BUT THINKING HE KNEW OF HIM
6080-58012-0008 WAS A CLOSE STUDENT OF THE AFFAIRS OF HIS COUNTRY AND HE SAW THAT WHICH RAISED GRAVE DOUBTS IN HIS MIND AS TO THE OUTCOME OF HIS CAREER HE SAW MANY OF THE CIVIL INSTITUTIONS OF HIS COUNTRY
6080-58012-0009 DEBASED BY THE POWER OF WEALTH UNDER THE THIN GUISE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION OF PROPERTY HE SAW THE ARMY WHICH HE HAD SWORN TO SERVE FAITHFULLY BECOMING PROSTITUTED BY THIS SAME POWER AND USED AT TIMES FOR PURPOSES OF INTIMIDATION
6080-58012-0010 AND PETTY CONQUESTS WHERE THE INTERESTS OF WEALTH WERE AT STAKE HE SAW THE GREAT CITY WHERE LUXURY DOMINANT AND DEFIANT EXISTED LARGELY BY GRACE OF EXPLOITATION EXPLOITATION OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN
6080-58012-0011 THE YOUNG MAN'S EYES HAD BECOME BRIGHT AND HARD WHEN HIS DAY DREAM WAS INTERRUPTED AND HE WAS LOOKING INTO THE GRAY BLUE EYES OF GLORIA STRAWN THE ONE WHOSE LOT HE HAD BEEN COMPARING TO THAT OF HER SISTERS IN THE CITY IN THE MILLS THE SWEATSHOPS
6080-58012-0012 THE BIG STORES AND THE STREETS HE HAD MET HER FOR THE FIRST TIME A FEW HOURS BEFORE WHEN HIS FRIEND AND CLASSMATE JACK STRAWN HAD PRESENTED HIM TO HIS SISTER NO COMRADE KNEW DRU BETTER THAN STRAWN
6080-58012-0013 AND NO ONE ADMIRED HIM SO MUCH THEREFORE GLORIA EVER SEEKING A CLOSER CONTACT WITH LIFE HAD COME TO WEST POINT EAGER TO MEET THE LITHE YOUNG KENTUCKIAN AND TO MEASURE HIM BY THE OTHER MEN OF HER ACQUAINTANCE
6080-58012-0014 SHE FORGOT HER DISAPPOINTMENT AND HER INTEREST REVIVED FOR HER SHARP CITY SENSE CAUGHT THE TRAIL OF A NEW EXPERIENCE TO PHILIP DRU WHOSE THOUGHT OF AND EXPERIENCE WITH WOMEN WAS ALMOST NOTHING
6080-58012-0015 SO ENGROSSED HAD HE BEEN IN HIS STUDIES MILITARY AND ECONOMIC GLORIA SEEMED LITTLE MORE THAN A CHILD AND YET HER FRANK GLANCE OF APPRAISAL WHEN HE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO HER
6080-58012-0016 SUDDENLY TURNING FROM THE COMMONPLACES OF THE DAY GLORIA LOOKED DIRECTLY AT PHILIP AND WITH EASY SELF POSSESSION TURNED THE CONVERSATION TO HIMSELF I AM WONDERING MISTER DRU
6080-58012-0017 SHE ASKED AN AMERICAN SOLDIER HAS TO FIGHT SO SELDOM THAT I HAVE HEARD THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES REGARD THEM AS THE BEST OF RISKS SO WHAT ATTRACTION MISTER DRU CAN A MILITARY CAREER HAVE FOR YOU
6080-58012-0018 AND IT SURPRISED HIM THAT IT SHOULD COME FROM THIS SLIP OF A GIRL BUT HE ANSWERED HER IN THE SERIOUS STRAIN OF HIS THOUGHTS AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER HE SAID I HAVE WANTED TO BE A SOLDIER I HAVE NO DESIRE TO DESTROY AND KILL
6080-58012-0019 AND YET THERE IS WITHIN ME THE LUST FOR ACTION AND BATTLE IT IS THE PRIMITIVE MAN IN ME I SUPPOSE BUT SOBERED AND ENLIGHTENED BY CIVILIZATION I WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO AVERT WAR AND THE SUFFERING IT ENTAILS FATE
6080-58012-0020 INCLINATION OR WHAT NOT HAS BROUGHT ME HERE AND I HOPE MY LIFE MAY NOT BE WASTED BUT THAT IN GOD'S OWN WAY I MAY BE A HUMBLE INSTRUMENT FOR GOOD
6080-58012-0021 OFTENTIMES OUR INCLINATIONS LEAD US IN CERTAIN DIRECTIONS AND IT IS ONLY AFTERWARDS THAT IT SEEMS AS IF FATE MAY FROM THE FIRST HAVE SO DETERMINED IT THE MISCHIEVOUS TWINKLE LEFT THE GIRL'S EYES
6080-58012-0022 AND THE LANGUID TONE OF HER VOICE CHANGED TO ONE A LITTLE MORE LIKE SINCERITY BUT SUPPOSE THERE IS NO WAR SHE DEMANDED SUPPOSE YOU GO ON LIVING AT BARRACKS HERE AND THERE AND WITH NO BROADER OUTLOOK THAN SUCH A LIFE ENTAILS
6080-58012-0023 WILL YOU BE SATISFIED IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE IN MIND TO DO IN THE WORLD HE LOOKED AT HER MORE PERPLEXED THAN EVER SUCH AN OBSERVATION OF LIFE HIS LIFE SEEMED BEYOND HER YEARS FOR HE KNEW BUT LITTLE OF THE WOMEN OF HIS OWN GENERATION
6080-58012-0024 HE WONDERED TOO IF SHE WOULD UNDERSTAND IF HE TOLD HER ALL THAT WAS IN HIS MIND GLORIA WE ARE ENTERING A NEW ERA THE PAST IS NO LONGER TO BE A GUIDE TO THE FUTURE
6080-58012-0025 THERE AROSE IN FRANCE A GIANT THAT HAD SLUMBERED FOR UNTOLD CENTURIES HE KNEW HE HAD SUFFERED GRIEVOUS WRONGS BUT HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO RIGHT THEM HE THEREFORE STRUCK OUT BLINDLY AND CRUELLY AND THE INNOCENT WENT DOWN WITH THE GUILTY
6080-58012-0026 HE WAS ALMOST WHOLLY IGNORANT FOR IN THE SCHEME OF SOCIETY AS THEN CONSTRUCTED THE RULING FEW FELT THAT HE MUST BE KEPT IGNORANT OTHERWISE THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE TO HOLD HIM IN BONDAGE FOR HIM THE DOOR OF OPPORTUNITY WAS CLOSED
6080-58012-0027 AND HE STRUGGLED FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE FOR THE MINIMUM OF FOOD AND CLOTHING NECESSARY TO KEEP BREATH WITHIN THE BODY HIS LABOR AND HIS VERY LIFE ITSELF WAS SUBJECT TO THE GREED THE PASSION AND THE CAPRICE OF HIS OVER LORD
6080-58012-0028 SO HE WAS LED BY WEAK AND SELFISH MEN WHO COULD ONLY INCITE HIM TO FURTHER WANTON MURDER AND DEMOLITION BUT OUT OF THAT REVELRY OF BLOOD THERE DAWNED UPON MANKIND THE HOPE OF A MORE SPLENDID DAY THE DIVINITY OF KINGS
6080-58012-0029 THE GOD GIVEN RIGHT TO RULE WAS SHATTERED FOR ALL TIME THE GIANT AT LAST KNEW HIS STRENGTH AND WITH HEAD ERECT AND THE LIGHT OF FREEDOM IN HIS EYES HE DARED TO ASSERT THE LIBERTY EQUALITY AND FRATERNITY OF MAN
6080-58012-0030 THEN THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN WORLD ONE STRATUM OF SOCIETY AFTER ANOTHER DEMANDED AND OBTAINED THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE WEALTH AND TO SHARE IN THE GOVERNMENT HERE AND THERE ONE BOLDER AND MORE FORCEFUL THAN THE REST ACQUIRED GREAT WEALTH
6080-58012-0031 AND WITH IT GREAT POWER NOT SATISFIED WITH REASONABLE GAIN THEY SOUGHT TO MULTIPLY IT BEYOND ALL BOUNDS OF NEED THEY WHO HAD SPRUNG FROM THE PEOPLE A SHORT LIFE SPAN AGO
6080-58012-0032 WERE NOW THROTTLING INDIVIDUAL EFFORT AND SHACKLING THE GREAT MOVEMENT FOR EQUAL RIGHTS AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY DRU'S VOICE BECAME TENSE AND VIBRANT AND HE TALKED IN QUICK SHARP JERKS
