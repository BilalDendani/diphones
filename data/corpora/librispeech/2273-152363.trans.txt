2273-152363-0000 THE MEDITERRANEAN APART FROM ALL THE ASSOCIATIONS OF ADVENTURE AND GLORY THE COMMON HERITAGE OF ALL MANKIND MAKES A TENDER APPEAL TO A SEAMAN IT HAS SHELTERED THE INFANCY OF HIS CRAFT
2273-152363-0001 HE LOOKS UPON IT AS A MAN MAY LOOK AT A VAST NURSERY IN AN OLD OLD MANSION WHERE INNUMERABLE GENERATIONS OF HIS OWN PEOPLE HAVE LEARNED TO WALK I SAY HIS OWN PEOPLE BECAUSE IN A SENSE
2273-152363-0002 ALL SAILORS BELONG TO ONE FAMILY ALL ARE DESCENDED FROM THAT ADVENTUROUS AND SHAGGY ANCESTOR WHO BESTRIDING A SHAPELESS LOG AND PADDLING WITH A CROOKED BRANCH ACCOMPLISHED THE FIRST COASTING TRIP
2273-152363-0003 IN A SHELTERED BAY RINGING WITH THE ADMIRING HOWLS OF HIS TRIBE IT IS A MATTER OF REGRET THAT ALL THOSE BROTHERS IN CRAFT AND FEELING WHOSE GENERATIONS HAVE LEARNED TO WALK A SHIP'S DECK IN THAT NURSERY
2273-152363-0004 HAVE BEEN ALSO MORE THAN ONCE FIERCELY ENGAGED IN CUTTING EACH OTHER'S THROATS THERE BUT LIFE APPARENTLY HAS SUCH EXIGENCIES WITHOUT HUMAN PROPENSITY TO MURDER AND OTHER SORTS OF UNRIGHTEOUSNESS
2273-152363-0005 THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO HISTORICAL HEROISM IT IS A CONSOLING REFLECTION AND THEN IF ONE EXAMINES IMPARTIALLY THE DEEDS OF VIOLENCE THEY APPEAR OF BUT SMALL CONSEQUENCE
2273-152363-0006 FROM SALAMIS TO ACTIUM THROUGH LEPANTO AND THE NILE TO THE NAVAL MASSACRE OF NAVARINO NOT TO MENTION OTHER ARMED ENCOUNTERS OF LESSER INTEREST ALL THE BLOOD HEROICALLY SPILT INTO THE MEDITERRANEAN
2273-152363-0007 HAS NOT STAINED WITH A SINGLE TRAIL OF PURPLE THE DEEP AZURE OF ITS CLASSIC WATERS OF COURSE IT MAY BE ARGUED THAT BATTLES HAVE SHAPED THE DESTINY OF MANKIND
2273-152363-0008 THE QUESTION WHETHER THEY HAVE SHAPED IT WELL WOULD REMAIN OPEN HOWEVER BUT IT WOULD BE HARDLY WORTH DISCUSSING IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT HAD THE BATTLE OF SALAMIS NEVER BEEN FOUGHT THE FACE OF THE WORLD
2273-152363-0009 WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH AS WE BEHOLD IT NOW FASHIONED BY THE MEDIOCRE INSPIRATION AND THE SHORT SIGHTED LABOURS OF MEN FROM A LONG AND MISERABLE EXPERIENCE OF SUFFERING INJUSTICE DISGRACE AND AGGRESSION
2273-152363-0010 THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH ARE MOSTLY SWAYED BY FEAR FEAR OF THE SORT THAT A LITTLE CHEAP ORATORY TURNS EASILY TO RAGE HATE AND VIOLENCE INNOCENT GUILELESS FEAR
2273-152363-0011 HAS BEEN THE CAUSE OF MANY WARS NOT OF COURSE THE FEAR OF WAR ITSELF WHICH IN THE EVOLUTION OF SENTIMENTS AND IDEAS
2273-152363-0012 WITH CERTAIN FASHIONABLE RITES AND PRELIMINARY INCANTATIONS WHEREIN THE CONCEPTION OF ITS TRUE NATURE HAS BEEN LOST TO APPREHEND THE TRUE ASPECT
2273-152363-0013 FORCE AND MORALITY OF WAR AS A NATURAL FUNCTION OF MANKIND ONE REQUIRES A FEATHER IN THE HAIR AND A RING IN THE NOSE OR BETTER STILL TEETH FILED TO A POINT
2273-152363-0014 AND A TATTOOED BREAST UNFORTUNATELY A RETURN TO SUCH SIMPLE ORNAMENTATION IS IMPOSSIBLE WE ARE BOUND TO THE CHARIOT OF PROGRESS THERE IS NO GOING BACK AND AS BAD LUCK WOULD HAVE IT
2273-152363-0015 OUR CIVILIZATION WHICH HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR THE COMFORT AND ADORNMENT OF OUR BODIES AND THE ELEVATION OF OUR MINDS HAS MADE LAWFUL KILLING FRIGHTFULLY AND NEEDLESSLY EXPENSIVE
2273-152363-0016 THE WHOLE QUESTION OF IMPROVED ARMAMENTS HAS BEEN APPROACHED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE EARTH IN A SPIRIT OF NERVOUS AND UNREFLECTING HASTE WHEREAS THE RIGHT WAY WAS LYING PLAINLY BEFORE THEM
2273-152363-0017 AND HAD ONLY TO BE PURSUED WITH CALM DETERMINATION THE LEARNED VIGILS AND LABOURS OF A CERTAIN CLASS OF INVENTORS SHOULD HAVE BEEN REWARDED WITH HONOURABLE LIBERALITY AS JUSTICE DEMANDED
2273-152363-0018 AND THE BODIES OF THE INVENTORS SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLOWN TO PIECES BY MEANS OF THEIR OWN PERFECTED EXPLOSIVES AND IMPROVED WEAPONS WITH EXTREME PUBLICITY AS THE COMMONEST PRUDENCE DICTATED BY THIS METHOD
2273-152363-0019 THE ARDOUR OF RESEARCH IN THAT DIRECTION WOULD HAVE BEEN RESTRAINED WITHOUT INFRINGING THE SACRED PRIVILEGES OF SCIENCE FOR THE LACK OF A LITTLE COOL THINKING IN OUR GUIDES AND MASTERS THIS COURSE HAS NOT BEEN FOLLOWED
2273-152363-0020 AND A BEAUTIFUL SIMPLICITY HAS BEEN SACRIFICED FOR NO REAL ADVANTAGE A FRUGAL MIND CANNOT DEFEND ITSELF FROM CONSIDERABLE BITTERNESS WHEN REFLECTING THAT AT THE BATTLE OF ACTIUM
2273-152363-0021 WHICH WAS FOUGHT FOR NO LESS A STAKE THAN THE DOMINION OF THE WORLD THE FLEET OF OCTAVIANUS CAESAR AND THE FLEET OF ANTONIUS INCLUDING THE EGYPTIAN DIVISION
2273-152363-0022 AND CLEOPATRA'S GALLEY WITH PURPLE SAILS PROBABLY COST LESS THAN TWO MODERN BATTLESHIPS OR AS THE MODERN NAVAL BOOK JARGON HAS IT TWO CAPITAL UNITS
2273-152363-0023 BUT NO AMOUNT OF LUBBERLY BOOK JARGON CAN DISGUISE A FACT WELL CALCULATED TO AFFLICT THE SOUL OF EVERY SOUND ECONOMIST IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT THE MEDITERRANEAN
2273-152363-0024 WILL EVER BEHOLD A BATTLE WITH A GREATER ISSUE BUT WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR ANOTHER HISTORICAL FIGHT ITS BOTTOM WILL BE ENRICHED AS NEVER BEFORE
2273-152363-0025 AS SO VAST AND SO FULL OF WONDERS AND INDEED IT WAS TERRIBLE AND WONDERFUL FOR IT IS WE ALONE WHO SWAYED BY THE AUDACITY OF OUR MINDS AND THE TREMORS OF OUR HEARTS
2273-152363-0026 ARE THE SOLE ARTISANS OF ALL THE WONDER AND ROMANCE OF THE WORLD IT WAS FOR THE MEDITERRANEAN SAILORS THAT FAIR HAIRED SIRENS SANG AMONG THE BLACK ROCKS SEETHING IN WHITE FOAM
2273-152363-0027 AND MYSTERIOUS VOICES SPOKE IN THE DARKNESS ABOVE THE MOVING WAVE VOICES MENACING SEDUCTIVE OR PROPHETIC LIKE THAT VOICE HEARD AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA
2273-152363-0028 BY THE MASTER OF AN AFRICAN VESSEL IN THE GULF OF SYRTA WHOSE CALM NIGHTS ARE FULL OF STRANGE MURMURS AND FLITTING SHADOWS IT CALLED HIM BY NAME
2273-152363-0029 BIDDING HIM GO AND TELL ALL MEN THAT THE GREAT GOD PAN WAS DEAD BUT THE GREAT LEGEND OF THE MEDITERRANEAN THE LEGEND OF TRADITIONAL SONG AND GRAVE HISTORY LIVES FASCINATING AND IMMORTAL
2273-152363-0030 IN OUR MINDS THE DARK AND FEARFUL SEA OF THE SUBTLE ULYSSES WANDERINGS AGITATED BY THE WRATH OF OLYMPIAN GODS HARBOURING ON ITS ISLES THE FURY OF STRANGE MONSTERS
2273-152363-0031 AND THE WILES OF STRANGE WOMEN THE HIGHWAY OF HEROES AND SAGES OF WARRIORS PIRATES AND SAINTS THE WORKADAY SEA OF CARTHAGINIAN MERCHANTS AND THE PLEASURE LAKE OF THE ROMAN CAESARS
2273-152363-0032 CLAIMS THE VENERATION OF EVERY SEAMAN AS THE HISTORICAL HOME OF THAT SPIRIT OF OPEN DEFIANCE
2273-152363-0033 ISSUING THENCE TO THE WEST AND SOUTH AS A YOUTH LEAVES THE SHELTER OF HIS PARENTAL HOUSE THIS SPIRIT FOUND THE WAY TO THE INDIES DISCOVERED THE COASTS OF A NEW CONTINENT
2273-152363-0034 AND TRAVERSED AT LAST THE IMMENSITY OF THE GREAT PACIFIC RICH IN GROUPS OF ISLANDS REMOTE AND MYSTERIOUS LIKE THE CONSTELLATIONS OF THE SKY THE FIRST IMPULSE OF NAVIGATION
2273-152363-0035 TOOK ITS VISIBLE FORM IN THAT TIDELESS BASIN FREED FROM HIDDEN SHOALS AND TREACHEROUS CURRENTS
2273-152363-0036 UPON WHICH THE ROMANS ALONE RULED WITHOUT DISPUTE HAS KEPT FOR ME THE FASCINATION OF YOUTHFUL ROMANCE THE VERY FIRST CHRISTMAS NIGHT I EVER SPENT AWAY FROM LAND
2273-152363-0037 WAS EMPLOYED IN RUNNING BEFORE A GULF OF LIONS GALE WHICH MADE THE OLD SHIP GROAN IN EVERY TIMBER AS SHE SKIPPED BEFORE IT OVER THE SHORT SEAS UNTIL WE BROUGHT HER TO
2273-152363-0038 BATTERED AND OUT OF BREATH UNDER THE LEE OF MAJORCA WHERE THE SMOOTH WATER WAS TORN BY FIERCE CAT'S PAWS UNDER A VERY STORMY SKY WE OR RATHER THEY
2273-152363-0039 FOR I HAD HARDLY HAD TWO GLIMPSES OF SALT WATER IN MY LIFE TILL THEN KEPT HER STANDING OFF AND ON ALL THAT DAY WHILE I LISTENED FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH THE CURIOSITY OF MY TENDER YEARS
2273-152363-0040 TO THE SONG OF THE WIND IN A SHIP'S RIGGING THE MONOTONOUS AND VIBRATING NOTE WAS DESTINED TO GROW INTO THE INTIMACY OF THE HEART PASS INTO BLOOD AND BONE
2273-152363-0041 ACCOMPANY THE THOUGHTS AND ACTS OF TWO FULL DECADES REMAIN TO HAUNT LIKE A REPROACH THE PEACE OF THE QUIET FIRESIDE AND ENTER INTO THE VERY TEXTURE
2273-152363-0042 OF RESPECTABLE DREAMS DREAMED SAFELY UNDER A ROOF OF RAFTERS AND TILES THE WIND WAS FAIR BUT THAT DAY WE RAN NO MORE THE THING
2273-152363-0043 LEAKED SHE LEAKED FULLY GENEROUSLY OVERFLOWINGLY ALL OVER LIKE A BASKET I TOOK AN ENTHUSIASTIC PART IN THE EXCITEMENT CAUSED BY THAT LAST INFIRMITY OF NOBLE SHIPS
2273-152363-0044 WITHOUT CONCERNING MYSELF MUCH WITH THE WHY OR THE WHEREFORE THE SURMISE OF MY MATURER YEARS IS THAT BORED BY HER INTERMINABLE LIFE THE VENERABLE ANTIQUITY
2273-152363-0045 I KNEW GENERALLY VERY LITTLE AND LEAST OF ALL WHAT I WAS DOING IN THAT GALERE I REMEMBER THAT EXACTLY AS IN THE COMEDY OF MOLIERE
2273-152363-0046 NOT OF MY CONFIDENTIAL VALET HOWEVER BUT ACROSS GREAT DISTANCES OF LAND IN A LETTER WHOSE MOCKING BUT INDULGENT TURN ILL CONCEALED HIS ALMOST PATERNAL ANXIETY
2273-152363-0047 I FANCY I TRIED TO CONVEY TO HIM MY UTTERLY UNFOUNDED IMPRESSION THAT THE WEST INDIES AWAITED MY COMING I HAD TO GO THERE IT WAS A SORT OF MYSTIC CONVICTION
2273-152363-0048 SOMETHING IN THE NATURE OF A CALL BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO STATE INTELLIGIBLY THE GROUNDS OF THIS BELIEF TO THAT MAN OF RIGOROUS LOGIC IF OF INFINITE CHARITY THE TRUTH MUST HAVE BEEN THAT
2273-152363-0049 ALL UNVERSED IN THE ARTS OF THE WILY GREEK THE DECEIVER OF GODS THE LOVER OF STRANGE WOMEN
2273-152363-0050 I YET LONGED FOR THE BEGINNING OF MY OWN OBSCURE ODYSSEY WHICH AS WAS PROPER FOR A MODERN SHOULD UNROLL ITS WONDERS AND TERRORS BEYOND THE PILLARS OF HERCULES
2273-152363-0051 THE DISDAINFUL OCEAN DID NOT OPEN WIDE TO SWALLOW UP MY AUDACITY THOUGH THE SHIP THE RIDICULOUS AND ANCIENT GALERE OF MY FOLLY THE OLD WEARY DISENCHANTED SUGAR WAGGON
2273-152363-0052 WOULD HAVE BEEN AS FINAL A CATASTROPHE BUT NO CATASTROPHE OCCURRED I LIVED TO WATCH ON A STRANGE SHORE A BLACK AND YOUTHFUL NAUSICAA
2273-152363-0053 WITH A JOYOUS TRAIN OF ATTENDANT MAIDENS CARRYING BASKETS OF LINEN TO A CLEAR STREAM OVERHUNG BY THE HEADS OF SLENDER PALM TREES
2273-152363-0054 AND THE GOLD OF THEIR EARRINGS INVESTED WITH A BARBARIC AND REGAL MAGNIFICENCE THEIR FIGURES STEPPING OUT FREELY IN A SHOWER OF BROKEN SUNSHINE THE WHITENESS OF THEIR TEETH WAS STILL MORE DAZZLING
2273-152363-0055 THAN THE SPLENDOUR OF JEWELS AT THEIR EARS THE SHADED SIDE OF THE RAVINE GLEAMED WITH THEIR SMILES THEY WERE AS UNABASHED AS SO MANY PRINCESSES BUT ALAS
2273-152363-0056 NOT ONE OF THEM WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A JET BLACK SOVEREIGN SUCH WAS MY ABOMINABLE LUCK IN BEING BORN BY THE MERE HAIR'S BREADTH OF TWENTY FIVE CENTURIES TOO LATE
2273-152363-0057 INTO A WORLD WHERE KINGS HAVE BEEN GROWING SCARCE WITH SCANDALOUS RAPIDITY WHILE THE FEW WHO REMAIN HAVE ADOPTED THE UNINTERESTING MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF SIMPLE MILLIONAIRES
2273-152363-0058 WITH BASKETS OF LINEN ON THEIR HEADS TO THE BANKS OF A CLEAR STREAM OVERHUNG BY THE STARRY FRONDS OF PALM TREES IT WAS A VAIN HOPE IF I DID NOT ASK MYSELF WHETHER
2273-152363-0059 LIMITED BY SUCH DISCOURAGING IMPOSSIBILITIES LIFE WERE STILL WORTH LIVING IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE I HAD THEN BEFORE ME SEVERAL OTHER PRESSING QUESTIONS
2273-152363-0060 THE RESONANT LAUGHING VOICES OF THESE GORGEOUS MAIDENS SCARED AWAY THE MULTITUDE OF HUMMING BIRDS
2273-152363-0061 THE TOPS OF FLOWERING BUSHES NO THEY WERE NOT PRINCESSES THEIR UNRESTRAINED LAUGHTER FILLING THE HOT FERN CLAD RAVINE HAD A SOULLESS LIMPIDITY AS OF WILD INHUMAN DWELLERS IN TROPICAL WOODLANDS
