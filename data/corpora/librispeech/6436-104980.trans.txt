6436-104980-0000 IN ANOTHER PERSON IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES
6436-104980-0001 AS ONE OF INQUIRY AND WONDER BUT NEITHER INQUIRY NOR WONDER DESCRIBED THE PRESENT SITUATION AND I PUT MYSELF UPON MY GUARD SEEING ME LOOK HER WAY SHE FLUSHED AND THROWING WIDE THE DOOR REMARKED IN THE PLEASANTEST OF TONES
6436-104980-0002 THIS IS YOUR ROOM MISSUS PACKARD SAYS THAT IF IT IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH OR DOES NOT SEEM PLEASANT TO YOU SHE WILL FIND YOU ANOTHER ONE TO MORROW
6436-104980-0003 I COULD NOT BE MORE COMFORTABLE SHE SMILED A TRIFLE BROADLY FOR THE OCCASION I THOUGHT AND PATTED A PILLOW HERE AND TWITCHED A CURTAIN THERE AS SHE REMARKED WITH A CERTAIN EMPHASIS I'M SURE YOU WILL BE COMFORTABLE THERE'S NOBODY ELSE ON THIS FLOOR BUT LETTY AND THE BABY
6436-104980-0004 BUT YOU DON'T LOOK AS IF YOU WOULD BE EASILY FRIGHTENED ASTONISHED NOT SO MUCH BY HER WORDS AS BY THE FURTIVE LOOK SHE GAVE ME I LAUGHED AS I REPEATED FRIGHTENED WHAT SHOULD FRIGHTEN ME OH NOTHING HER BACK WAS TO ME NOW BUT I FELT THAT I KNEW HER VERY LOOK
6436-104980-0005 NOTHING OF COURSE IF YOU'RE NOT TIMID YOU WON'T MIND SLEEPING SO FAR AWAY FROM EVERY ONE THEN WE ARE ALWAYS WITHIN CALL THE ATTIC DOOR IS JUST A FEW STEPS OFF WE'LL LEAVE IT UNLOCKED AND YOU CAN COME UP IF IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT AT ANY TIME
6436-104980-0006 WE'LL UNDERSTAND UNDERSTAND I EYED HER AS SHE AGAIN LOOKED MY WAY WITH SOME OF HER OWN CURIOSITY IF NOT WONDER MISSUS PACKARD MUST HAVE HAD SOME VERY TIMOROUS GUESTS I OBSERVED
6436-104980-0007 THE HOUSE IS SO LARGE AND IMPOSING FOR THE QUARTER IT IS IN I CAN READILY IMAGINE IT TO ATTRACT BURGLARS BURGLARS IT WOULD BE A BRAVE BURGLAR WHO WOULD TRY TO GET IN HERE I GUESS YOU NEVER HEARD ABOUT THIS HOUSE NO I ADMITTED
6436-104980-0008 UNPLEASANTLY DIVIDED BETWEEN A WISH TO DRAW HER OUT AND THE FEAR OF BETRAYING MAYOR PACKARD'S TRUST IN ME BY SHOWING THE EXTENT OF MY INTEREST WELL IT'S ONLY GOSSIP SHE LAUGHINGLY ASSURED ME YOU NEEDN'T THINK OF IT MISS
6436-104980-0009 I'M SURE YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT WE GIRLS HAVE BEEN SO FAR AND MISSUS PACKARD HERE SHE DOUBTLESS HEARD A VOICE OUTSIDE OR SOME SUMMONS FROM BELOW FOR SHE MADE A QUICK START TOWARD THE DOOR
6436-104980-0010 DINNER AT SEVEN MISS THERE'LL BE NO EXTRA COMPANY TO NIGHT I'M COMING THIS TO SOME ONE IN THE HALL AS SHE HASTILY PASSED THROUGH THE DOOR DROPPING THE BAG I HAD LIFTED TO UNPACK I STARED AT THE DOOR WHICH HAD SOFTLY CLOSED UNDER HER HAND
6436-104980-0011 THEN WITH AN ODD IMPULSE TURNED TO LOOK AT MY OWN FACE IN THE GLASS BEFORE WHICH I CHANCED TO BE STANDING DID I EXPECT TO FIND THERE SOME EVIDENCE OF THE EXCITEMENT WHICH THIS STRANGE CONVERSATION MIGHT NATURALLY PRODUCE
6436-104980-0012 IN ONE ALREADY KEYED UP TO AN EXPECTATION OF THE MYSTERIOUS AND UNUSUAL IF SO I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED MY FEATURES CERTAINLY BETRAYED THE EFFECT OF THIS UNEXPECTED ATTACK UPON MY PROFESSIONAL EQUANIMITY WHAT DID THE GIRL MEAN
6436-104980-0013 WHAT WAS SHE HINTING AT WHAT UNDERLAY WHAT COULD UNDERLIE HER SURPRISING REMARK I GUESS YOU NEVER HEARD ABOUT THIS HOUSE SOMETHING WORTH MY KNOWING SOMETHING WHICH MIGHT EXPLAIN MAYOR PACKARD'S FEARS AND MISSUS PACKARD'S THERE I STOPPED
6436-104980-0014 IT WAS WHERE THE GIRL HAD STOPPED SHE AND NOT I MUST ROUND OUT THIS UNCOMPLETED SENTENCE MEANWHILE I OCCUPIED MYSELF IN UNPACKING MY TWO BAGS AND MAKING ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ROOM WHICH
6436-104980-0015 I FELT WAS DESTINED TO BE THE SCENE OF MANY ANXIOUS THOUGHTS ITS FIRST EFFECT HAD BEEN A CHEERFUL ONE OWING TO ITS TWO LARGE WINDOWS ONE LOOKING OUT ON A STRETCH OF CLEAR SKY ABOVE A MASS OF LOW HUDDLED BUILDINGS
6436-104980-0016 AND THE OTHER ON THE WALL OF THE ADJACENT HOUSE WHICH THOUGH NEAR ENOUGH TO OBSTRUCT THE VIEW WAS NOT NEAR ENOUGH TO EXCLUDE ALL LIGHT ANOTHER AND CLOSER SCRUTINY OF THE ROOM DID NOT ALTER THE FIRST IMPRESSION
6436-104980-0017 TO THE ADVANTAGES OF LIGHT WERE ADDED THOSE OF DAINTY FURNISHING AND AN EXCEPTIONALLY PLEASING COLOR SCHEME THERE WAS NO RICHNESS ANYWHERE BUT AN ATTRACTIVE HARMONY WHICH GAVE ONE AN INSTANTANEOUS FEELING OF HOME
6436-104980-0018 FROM THE LITTLE BRASS BEDSTEAD CURTAINED WITH CRETONNE TO THE TINY DESK FILLED WITH EVERYTHING NEEDFUL FOR IMMEDIATE USE I SAW EVIDENCES OF THE MOST CAREFUL HOUSEKEEPING AND WAS VAINLY ASKING MYSELF WHAT COULD HAVE COME INTO MISSUS PACKARD'S LIFE
6436-104980-0019 TO DISTURB SO WHOLESOME A NATURE WHEN MY ATTENTION WAS ARRESTED BY A PICTURE HANGING AT THE RIGHT OF THE WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE NEXT HOUSE IT GAVE PROMISE OF BEING A MOST INTERESTING SKETCH AND I CROSSED OVER TO EXAMINE IT
6436-104980-0020 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING SO FOUND MY EYES DRAWN TOWARD SOMETHING MORE VITAL THAN ANY PICTURE AND TWICE AS ENCHAINING IT WAS A FACE THE FACE OF AN OLD WOMAN STARING DOWN AT ME FROM A SEMICIRCULAR OPENING IN THE GABLE OF THE ADJOINING HOUSE
6436-104980-0021 AN ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE IN ITSELF BUT MADE EXTRAORDINARY BY THE FIXITY OF HER GAZE WHICH WAS LEVELED STRAIGHT ON MINE AND THE UNCOMMON EXPRESSION OF BREATHLESS EAGERNESS WHICH GAVE FORCE TO HER OTHERWISE COMMONPLACE FEATURES
6436-104980-0022 SO REMARKABLE WAS THIS EXPRESSION AND SO APPARENTLY WAS IT DIRECTED AGAINST MYSELF THAT I FELT LIKE THROWING UP MY WINDOW AND ASKING THE POOR OLD CREATURE WHAT I COULD DO FOR HER BUT HER EXTREME IMMOBILITY DETERRED ME
6436-104980-0023 FOR ALL THE INTENTNESS OF HER LOOK THERE WAS NO INVITATION IN IT WARRANTING SUCH AN ADVANCE ON MY PART SHE SIMPLY STARED DOWN AT ME IN UNBROKEN ANXIETY NOR THOUGH I WATCHED HER FOR SOME MINUTES WITH AN INTENSITY EQUAL TO HER OWN
6436-104980-0024 DID I DETECT ANY CHANGE EITHER IN HER ATTITUDE OR EXPRESSION ODD THOUGHT I AND TESTED HER WITH A FRIENDLY BOW THE DEMONSTRATION FAILED TO PRODUCE THE LEAST IMPRESSION
6436-104980-0025 A MOST UNCANNY NEIGHBOR WAS MY MENTAL COMMENT ON FINALLY TURNING AWAY TRULY I WAS SURROUNDED BY MYSTERIES BUT FORTUNATELY THIS WAS ONE WITH WHICH I HAD NO IMMEDIATE CONCERN
6436-104980-0026 IT DID NOT TAKE ME LONG TO PUT AWAY MY FEW BELONGINGS AND PREPARE FOR DINNER WHEN QUITE READY I SAT DOWN TO WRITE A LETTER THIS COMPLETED I TURNED TO GO DOWNSTAIRS
6436-104980-0027 THE OLD WOMAN WAS STILL THERE AS OUR GLANCES MET I EXPERIENCED A THRILL WHICH WAS HARDLY ONE OF SYMPATHY YET WAS NOT EXACTLY ONE OF FEAR MY IMPULSE WAS TO PULL DOWN THE SHADE BETWEEN US BUT I HAD NOT THE HEART
6436-104980-0028 SHE WAS SO OLD SO FEEBLE AND SO EVIDENTLY THE PREY OF SOME STRANGE AND FIXED IDEA WHAT IDEA IT WAS NOT FOR ME TO SAY BUT I FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE ANY MOVE WHICH WOULD SEEM TO SHUT HER OUT SO I LEFT THE SHADE UP
6436-104980-0029 BUT HER IMAGE FOLLOWED ME AND I FORGOT IT ONLY WHEN CONFRONTED ONCE AGAIN WITH MISSUS PACKARD THAT LADY WAS AWAITING ME AT THE DINING ROOM DOOR SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN THROWING OFF HER SECRET DEPRESSION AND SMILED QUITE NATURALLY AS I APPROACHED
6436-104980-0030 HER EASY COURTEOUS MANNERS BECAME HER WONDERFULLY I IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED HOW MUCH THERE WAS TO ADMIRE IN OUR MAYOR'S WIFE AND QUITE UNDERSTOOD HIS RELIEF WHEN A FEW MINUTES LATER WE SAT AT TABLE AND CONVERSATION BEGAN
6436-104980-0031 MISSUS PACKARD WHEN FREE AND LIGHT HEARTED WAS A DELIGHTFUL COMPANION AND THE MEAL PASSED OFF CHEERILY WHEN WE ROSE AND THE MAYOR LEFT US FOR SOME NECESSARY BUSINESS IT WAS WITH A LOOK OF SATISFACTION IN MY DIRECTION
6436-104980-0032 WHICH WAS THE BEST POSSIBLE PREPARATION FOR MY APPROACHING TETE A TETE WITH HIS MOODY AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE WIFE BUT I WAS NOT DESTINED TO UNDERGO THE CONTEMPLATED ORDEAL THIS EVENING GUESTS WERE ANNOUNCED
6436-104980-0033 WHOM MISSUS PACKARD KINDLY INVITED ME TO MEET BUT I BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO ENJOY THE LIBRARY I HAD TOO MUCH TO CONSIDER JUST NOW TO FIND ANY PLEASURE IN SOCIETY THREE QUESTIONS FILLED MY MIND WHAT WAS MISSUS PACKARD'S SECRET TROUBLE
6436-104980-0034 WHY WERE PEOPLE AFRAID TO REMAIN IN THIS HOUSE WHY DID THE OLD WOMAN NEXT DOOR SHOW SUCH INTEREST IN THE NEW MEMBER OF HER NEIGHBOR'S HOUSEHOLD WOULD A SINGLE ANSWER COVER ALL WAS THERE BUT ONE CAUSE FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE PECULIARITIES
6436-104980-0035 PROBABLY AND IT WAS MY DUTY TO FERRET OUT THIS CAUSE BUT HOW SHOULD I BEGIN I REMEMBERED WHAT I HAD READ ABOUT DETECTIVES AND THEIR METHODS BUT THE HELP I THUS RECEIVED WAS SMALL SUBTLER METHODS WERE DEMANDED HERE
6436-104980-0036 AND SUBTLER METHODS I MUST FIND MEANTIME I WOULD HOPE FOR ANOTHER TALK WITH MAYOR PACKARD HE MIGHT CLEAR UP SOME OF THIS FOG AT LEAST I SHOULD LIKE TO GIVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY BUT I SAW NO WAY OF REACHING HIM AT PRESENT
6436-104980-0037 EVEN MISSUS PACKARD DID NOT FEEL AT LIBERTY TO DISTURB HIM IN HIS STUDY I MUST WAIT FOR HIS REAPPEARANCE AND IN THE MEANTIME DIVERT MYSELF AS BEST I COULD I CAUGHT UP A MAGAZINE BUT SPEEDILY DROPPED IT TO CAST A QUICK GLANCE AROUND THE ROOM HAD I HEARD ANYTHING
6436-104980-0038 NO THE HOUSE WAS PERFECTLY STILL SAVE FOR THE SOUND OF CONVERSATION IN THE DRAWING ROOM YET I FOUND IT HARD TO KEEP MY EYES UPON THE PAGE QUITE WITHOUT MY VOLITION THEY FLEW FIRST TO ONE CORNER THEN TO ANOTHER THE ROOM WAS LIGHT
6436-104980-0039 THERE WERE NO SHADOWY NOOKS IN IT YET I FELT AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE TO PEER INTO EVERY PLACE NOT DIRECTLY UNDER MY EYE I KNEW IT TO BE FOLLY AND AFTER SUCCUMBING TO THE TEMPTATION OF TAKING A SLY LOOK BEHIND A CERTAIN TALL SCREEN
6436-104980-0040 I RESOLUTELY SET MYSELF TO CURB MY RESTLESSNESS AND TO PERUSE IN GOOD EARNEST THE ARTICLE I HAD BEGUN TO MAKE SURE OF MYSELF I ARTICULATED EACH WORD ALOUD AND TO MY EXCEEDING SATISFACTION HAD REACHED THE SECOND COLUMN
6436-104980-0041 WHEN I FOUND MY VOICE TRAILING OFF INTO SILENCE AND EVERY SENSE ALARMINGLY ALERT YET THERE WAS NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN THIS WELL LIGHTED COZY FAMILY ROOM TO AWAKEN FEAR I WAS SURE OF THIS THE NEXT MINUTE
6436-104980-0042 AND FELT CORRESPONDINGLY IRRITATED WITH MYSELF AND DEEPLY HUMILIATED THAT MY NERVES SHOULD PLAY ME SUCH A TRICK AT THE VERY OUTSET OF MY BUSINESS IN THIS HOUSE THAT I COULD NOT BE LEFT ALONE WITH LIFE IN EVERY PART OF THE HOUSE
6436-104980-0043 AND THE SOUND OF THE PIANO AND CHEERFUL TALKING JUST ACROSS THE HALL WITHOUT THE SENSE OF THE MORBID AND UNEARTHLY ENTERING MY MATTER OF FACT BRAIN UTTERING AN EJACULATION OF CONTEMPT I RESEATED MYSELF THE IMPULSE CAME AGAIN TO LOOK BEHIND ME
6436-104980-0044 I ALREADY KNEW EVERY FEATURE OF THE ROOM ITS OLD FASHIONED MANTEL LARGE ROUND CENTER TABLE ITS COUCHES AND CHAIRS AND WHY SHOULD I WASTE MY ATTENTION AGAIN UPON THEM IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WISH MISS
6436-104980-0045 ASKED A VOICE DIRECTLY OVER MY SHOULDER I WHEELED ABOUT WITH A START
6436-104980-0046 IT WAS NOT SOUND WHICH HAD DISTURBED ME THE LIBRARY BELL RANG CONTINUED THE VOICE IS IT ICE WATER YOU WANT THEN I SAW THAT IT WAS NIXON THE BUTLER AND SHOOK MY HEAD IN MINGLED ANGER AND PERPLEXITY FOR NOT ONLY HAD HE ADVANCED QUITE NOISELESSLY
6436-104980-0047 BUT HE WAS LOOKING AT ME WITH THAT CURIOUS CONCENTRATED GAZE WHICH I HAD MET TWICE BEFORE SINCE COMING INTO THIS HOUSE I NEED NOTHING SAID I
6436-104980-0048 THE MAN HAD NO BUSINESS HERE I DID NOT RING AND I DON'T BELIEVE HE THOUGHT I DID HE MERELY WANTED TO SEE WHAT I WAS DOING AND WHETHER I WAS ENJOYING MYSELF WHY THIS CURIOSITY I HAVE NEVER ROUSED IT ANYWHERE ELSE
6436-104980-0049 BUT THE CAUSE AND PURPOSE OF MY PRESENCE UNDER THIS ROOF I PAUSED TO WONDER OVER THE FACT THAT THE ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY WHO MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO RESENT MY INTRUSION MOST WAS THE ONE WHO TOOK IT MOST KINDLY AND WITH LEAST TOKEN OF SURPRISE
6436-104980-0050 MISSUS PACKARD SHE ACCEPTS ME EASILY ENOUGH THOUGHT I TO HER I AM A WELCOME COMPANION WHAT AM I TO THESE THE ANSWER
6436-104980-0051 AND SEEING ME ALONE CAME FORWARD BRISKLY MISSUS PACKARD HAS COMPANY AND I AM ON MY WAY TO THE DRAWING ROOM BUT I AM HAPPY TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF ASSURING YOU THAT ALREADY SHE LOOKS BETTER AND THAT I BEGIN TO HOPE THAT YOUR ENCOURAGING PRESENCE MAY STIMULATE HER
6436-104980-0052 TO THROW ASIDE HER GLOOM AND NEEDLESS APPREHENSIONS I SHALL BE ETERNALLY GRATEFUL TO YOU IF IT WILL
6436-104980-0053 I FAILED TO FEEL THE SAME ELATION OVER THIS POSSIBLY TEMPORARY IMPROVEMENT IN HIS WIFE'S CONDITION BUT I CAREFULLY REFRAINED FROM BETRAYING MY DOUBTS ON THE CONTRARY I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE MOMENT TO CLEAR MY MIND OF ONE OF THE MANY PERPLEXITIES DISTURBING IT
6436-104980-0054 AND I AM GLAD OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ASK YOU WHAT MAY SEEM A FOOLISH IF NOT IMPERTINENT QUESTION THE MAID ELLEN IN SHOWING ME MY ROOM WAS VERY CAREFUL TO ASSURE ME
6436-104980-0055 IN A HOUSE FULL OF PEOPLE MADE THE REMARK I GUESS YOU DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS HOUSE WILL YOU PARDON ME IF I ASK IF THERE IS ANYTHING I DON'T KNOW AND SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE HOME YOUR SUFFERING WIFE INHABITS A PROBLEM SUCH AS YOU HAVE GIVEN ME TO SOLVE
6436-104980-0056 CAPABLE OF CREATING DISTURBANCE IN A SENSITIVE MIND THE MAYOR'S SHORT LAUGH FAILED TO HIDE HIS ANNOYANCE YOU WILL FIND NOTHING IN THIS DIRECTION SAID HE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CONDITION I HAVE MENTIONED TO YOU
6436-104980-0057 MISSUS PACKARD IS UTTERLY DEVOID OF SUPERSTITION THAT I MADE SURE OF BEFORE SIGNING THE LEASE OF THIS OLD HOUSE BUT I FORGOT YOU ARE DOUBTLESS IGNORANT OF ITS REPUTATION IT HAS OR RATHER HAS HAD THE NAME OF BEING HAUNTED
6436-104980-0058 RIDICULOUS OF COURSE BUT A FACT WITH WHICH MISSUS PACKARD HAS HAD TO CONTEND IN HE GAVE ME A QUICK GLANCE IN HIRING SERVANTS IT WAS NOW MY TURN TO SMILE BUT SOMEHOW I DID NOT
6436-104980-0059 A VISION HAD RISEN IN MY MIND OF THAT BLANK AND STARING FACE IN THE ATTIC WINDOW NEXT DOOR AND I FELT WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW I FELT BUT I DID NOT SMILE ANOTHER SHORT LAUGH ESCAPED HIM
6436-104980-0060 WE HAVE NOT BEEN FAVORED BY ANY MANIFESTATIONS FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD THIS HAS PROVED A VERY MATTER OF FACT SORT OF HOME FOR US I HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS BURDENED WITH SUCH AN UNCANNY REPUTATION AND I'M SURE THAT MISSUS PACKARD WOULD HAVE SHARED MY INDIFFERENCE
6436-104980-0061 I JUDGE THAT YOU RENT IT YES WE RENT IT AND WE HAVE BEEN HERE TWO MONTHS IT WAS THE ONLY HOUSE I COULD GET IN A LOCALITY CONVENIENT FOR ME BESIDES THE OLD PLACE SUITS ME IT WOULD TAKE MORE THAN AN OBSOLETE GHOST OR SO TO SCARE ME AWAY FROM WHAT I LIKE
6436-104980-0062 BUT MISSUS PACKARD SHE MAY NOT BE A SUPERSTITIOUS WOMAN YET DON'T BE FANCIFUL MISS SAUNDERS YOU WILL HAVE TO LOOK DEEPER THAN THAT FOR THE SPELL WHICH HAS BEEN CAST OVER MY WIFE OLYMPIA AFRAID OF CREAKS AND GROANS OLYMPIA SEEING SIGHTS
6436-104980-0063 SHE'S MUCH TOO PRACTICAL BY NATURE MISS SAUNDERS TO SAY NOTHING OF THE FACT THAT SHE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE CONFIDED HER TROUBLE TO ME HAD HER IMAGINATION BEEN STIRRED IN THIS WAY LITTLE THINGS HAVE INVARIABLY BEEN DISCUSSED BETWEEN US I REPEAT
6436-104980-0064 THAT THIS POSSIBILITY SHOULD NOT GIVE YOU A MOMENT'S THOUGHT A BURST OF SWEET SINGING CAME FROM THE DRAWING ROOM THAT'S HER VOICE HE CRIED WHATEVER HER TROUBLE MAY BE SHE HAS FORGOTTEN IT FOR THE MOMENT EXCUSE ME IF I JOIN HER
6436-104980-0065 IT IS SUCH PLEASURE TO HAVE HER AT ALL LIKE HERSELF AGAIN I LONGED TO DETAIN HIM LONGED TO PUT SOME OF THE NUMBERLESS QUESTIONS MY AWAKENED CURIOSITY DEMANDED BUT HIS IMPATIENCE WAS TOO MARKED AND I LET HIM DEPART WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
