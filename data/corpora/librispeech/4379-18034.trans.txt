4379-18034-0000 FOR HIS SPEECHES WERE SO PERSUASIVE SO POWERFUL SO FULL OF HOMELY AND PATRIOTIC FEELING THAT THE MEN WHO HEARD THEM THRONGED INTO THE RANKS AND AS A PREACHER HE USES PERSUASION POWER SIMPLE AND HOMELY ELOQUENCE
4379-18034-0001 TO DRAW MEN TO THE RANKS OF CHRISTIANITY HE IS AN ORATOR BORN AND HAS DEVELOPED THIS INBORN POWER BY THE HARDEST OF STUDY AND THOUGHT AND PRACTICE HE IS ONE OF THOSE RARE MEN WHO ALWAYS SEIZE AND HOLD THE ATTENTION
4379-18034-0002 WHEN HE SPEAKS MEN LISTEN IT IS QUALITY TEMPERAMENT CONTROL THE WORD IS IMMATERIAL BUT THE FACT IS VERY MATERIAL INDEED
4379-18034-0003 SOME QUARTER OF A CENTURY AGO CONWELL PUBLISHED A LITTLE BOOK FOR STUDENTS ON THE STUDY AND PRACTICE OF ORATORY THAT CLEAR CUT ARTICULATION IS THE CHARM OF ELOQUENCE IS ONE OF HIS INSISTED UPON STATEMENTS
4379-18034-0004 HE AVOIDS ELOCUTION HIS VOICE IS SOFT PITCHED AND NEVER BREAKS EVEN NOW WHEN HE IS OVER SEVENTY
4379-18034-0005 THERE IS NEVER A STRAINING AFTER EFFECT A SPEAKER MUST POSSESS A LARGE HEARTED REGARD FOR THE WELFARE OF HIS AUDIENCE HE WRITES AND HERE AGAIN WE SEE CONWELL EXPLAINING CONWELLISM
4379-18034-0006 WITH EVERY SERMON AND EVERY LECTURE THAT HE DELIVERS IT IS EASY TO RAISE A LAUGH BUT DANGEROUS FOR IT IS THE GREATEST TEST OF AN ORATOR'S CONTROL OF HIS AUDIENCE TO BE ABLE TO LAND THEM
4379-18034-0007 I HAVE KNOWN HIM AT THE VERY END OF A SERMON
4379-18034-0008 HE HAS EVERY INDIVIDUAL UNDER HIS CONTROL LISTENING SOBERLY TO HIS WORDS HE NEVER FEARS TO USE HUMOR AND IT IS ALWAYS VERY SIMPLE AND OBVIOUS AND EFFECTIVE WITH HIM EVEN A VERY SIMPLE PUN MAY BE USED
4379-18034-0009 NOT ONLY WITH OUT TAKING AWAY FROM THE STRENGTH OF WHAT HE IS SAYING BUT WITH A VIVID INCREASE OF IMPRESSIVENESS
4379-18034-0010 HE MET LAST MONTH OR LAST YEAR OR TEN YEARS AGO IN OHIO IN CALIFORNIA IN LONDON IN PARIS IN NEW YORK IN BOMBAY AND EACH MEMORY EACH ILLUSTRATION IS A HAMMER WITH WHICH HE DRIVES HOME A TRUTH
4379-18034-0011 THE VAST NUMBER OF PLACES HE HAS VISITED AND PEOPLE HE HAS MET THE INFINITE VARIETY OF THINGS HIS OBSERVANT EYES HAVE SEEN GIVE HIM HIS CEASELESS FLOW OF ILLUSTRATIONS AND HIS MEMORY AND HIS SKILL MAKE ADMIRABLE USE OF THEM
4379-18034-0012 THAT HAS FIGURED IN THE ILLUSTRATION WHEN HE ILLUSTRATES WITH THE STORY OF THE DISCOVERY OF CALIFORNIA GOLD AT SUTTER'S HE ALMOST PARENTHETICALLY REMARKS I DELIVERED THIS LECTURE ON THAT VERY SPOT A FEW YEARS AGO
4379-18034-0013 THAT IS IN THE TOWN THAT AROSE ON THAT VERY SPOT AND WHEN HE ILLUSTRATES BY THE STORY OF THE INVENTION OF THE SEWING MACHINE HE ADDS I SUPPOSE THAT IF ANY OF YOU WERE ASKED WHO WAS THE INVENTOR OF THE SEWING MACHINE YOU WOULD SAY THAT IT WAS ELIAS HOWE
4379-18034-0014 BUT THAT WOULD BE A MISTAKE I WAS WITH ELIAS HOWE IN THE CIVIL WAR AND HE OFTEN USED TO TELL ME
4379-18034-0015 LISTENING TO HIM YOU BEGIN TO FEEL IN TOUCH WITH EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING AND IN A FRIENDLY AND INTIMATE WAY ALWAYS WHETHER IN THE PULPIT OR ON THE PLATFORM AS IN PRIVATE CONVERSATION THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE SIMPLICITY ABOUT THE MAN AND HIS WORDS
4379-18034-0016 A SIMPLICITY AN EARNESTNESS A COMPLETE HONESTY AND WHEN HE SETS DOWN IN HIS BOOK ON ORATORY A MAN HAS NO RIGHT TO USE WORDS CARELESSLY HE STANDS FOR THAT RESPECT FOR WORD CRAFTSMANSHIP THAT EVERY SUCCESSFUL
4379-18034-0017 SPEAKER OR WRITER MUST FEEL BE INTENSELY IN EARNEST HE WRITES AND IN WRITING THIS HE SETS DOWN A PRIME PRINCIPLE NOT ONLY OF HIS ORATORY BUT OF HIS LIFE A YOUNG MINISTER TOLD ME THAT DOCTOR CONWELL ONCE SAID TO HIM WITH DEEP FEELING
4379-18034-0018 I FEEL WHENEVER I PREACH THAT THERE IS ALWAYS ONE PERSON IN THE CONGREGATION TO WHOM IN ALL PROBABILITY I SHALL NEVER PREACH AGAIN AND THEREFORE I FEEL THAT I MUST EXERT MY UTMOST POWER IN THAT LAST CHANCE
4379-18034-0019 AND IN THIS EVEN IF THIS WERE ALL ONE SEES
4379-18034-0020 NOT A MOMENT NOT AN OPPORTUNITY MUST BE LOST
4379-18034-0021 HE HAS THE ATTENTION OF EVERY ONE IN THE BUILDING AND THIS ATTENTION HE CLOSELY HOLDS TILL HE IS THROUGH YET IT IS NEVER BY A STRIKING EFFORT THAT ATTENTION IS GAINED EXCEPT IN SO FAR
4379-18034-0022 HOMELY KINDLY FRIENDLY WORDS PROMISED AND HOW EFFECTIVELY
4379-18034-0023 BUT TO THE READING OF THE BIBLE WHOSE DESCRIPTIONS HE NOT ONLY VISUALIZES TO HIMSELF BUT MAKES VIVIDLY CLEAR TO HIS HEARERS
4379-18034-0024 THOU SHALT MEET A COMPANY OF SINGERS COMING DOWN FROM THE HIGH PLACE WHEREUPON HE AGAIN INTERRUPTS HIMSELF
4379-18034-0025 THE DESIRED PICTURE IN THE MIND OF EVERY ONE HE SAYS THAT MEANS FROM THE LITTLE OLD CHURCH ON THE HILL YOU KNOW AND HOW PLAIN AND CLEAR AND REAL AND INTERESTING MOST OF ALL INTERESTING IT IS FROM THIS MOMENT
4379-18034-0026 USUALLY SO INDEED AT THE PRAYER MEETINGS AND OFTEN IN EFFECT AT THE CHURCH SERVICES I REMEMBER AT ONE CHURCH SERVICE THAT THE CHOIR LEADER WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF THE MASSED CHOIR
4379-18034-0027 WAS JUST AS UNCONSCIOUSLY THE REAL LEADER FOR IT WAS HE
4379-18034-0028 FOR HE POSSESSES A MYSTERIOUS FACULTY
4379-18034-0029 NOT ONLY SINGERS BUT THE MODERN EQUIVALENT OF PSALTERY AND TABRET AND CYMBALS
4379-18034-0030 FOR THERE MAY BE A PIANO AND THERE MAY EVEN BE A TROMBONE
4379-18034-0031 AND AT TIMES THERE ARE CHIMING BELLS HIS MUSICAL TASTE SEEMS TO TEND TOWARD THE THUNDEROUS OR PERHAPS
4379-18034-0032 AND HOW THE CHOIR THEMSELVES LIKE IT THEY OCCUPY A GREAT CURVING SPACE BEHIND THE PULPIT
4379-18034-0033 SOMETIMES THEY ARE STILL SINGING AND SOME OF THEM CONTINUE TO SING AS THEY GO SLOWLY OUT TOWARD THE DOORS
4379-18034-0034 JUST AS HOWELLS WAS SO LONG AGO TOLD THAT HE DID IN LEXINGTON AND THERE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN HAPPINESS THERE IS A SENSE OF EASE OF COMFORT OF GENERAL JOY THAT IS QUITE UNMISTAKABLE THERE IS NOTHING OF STIFFNESS OR CONSTRAINT
4379-18034-0035 AND WITH IT ALL THERE IS FULL REVERENCE IT IS NO WONDER THAT HE IS ACCUSTOMED TO FILL EVERY SEAT OF THE GREAT BUILDING HIS GESTURES ARE USUALLY VERY SIMPLE NOW AND THEN WHEN HE WORKS UP TO EMPHASIS HE STRIKES ONE FIST IN THE PALM OF THE OTHER HAND
4379-18034-0036 WHEN HE IS THROUGH YOU DO NOT REMEMBER THAT HE HAS MADE ANY GESTURES AT ALL BUT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE REMAINS WITH YOU AND THE LOOK OF HIS WONDERFUL EYES AND THOUGH HE IS PAST THE THREESCORE YEARS AND TEN
4379-18034-0037 HE LOOKS OUT OVER HIS PEOPLE WITH EYES THAT STILL HAVE THE VERITABLE LOOK OF YOUTH LIKE ALL GREAT MEN HE NOT ONLY DOES BIG THINGS BUT KEEPS IN TOUCH WITH MYRIAD DETAILS
4379-18034-0038 BREAKS QUIETLY IN WITH SUCH A NUMBER GIVING IT DAUPHIN STREET QUIETLY AND IN A LOW TONE YET EVERY ONE IN THE CHURCH HEARS DISTINCTLY EVERY SYLLABLE OF THAT LOW VOICE
4379-18034-0039 HIS FUND OF PERSONAL ANECDOTE OR PERSONAL REMINISCENCE IS CONSTANT AND ILLUSTRATIVE
4379-18034-0040 JUST AS IT IS WHEN HE LECTURES AND THE REMINISCENCES SWEEP THROUGH MANY YEARS AND AT TIMES ARE REALLY STARTLING IN THE VIVID AND HOMELIKE PICTURES THEY PRESENT OF THE FAMOUS FOLK OF THE PAST THAT HE KNEW ONE SUNDAY EVENING
4379-18034-0041 I ASKED MAJOR MC KINLEY WHOM I HAD MET IN WASHINGTON AND WHOSE HOME WAS IN NORTHERN OHIO AS WAS THAT OF MISTER GARFIELD TO GO WITH ME TO MISTER GARFIELD'S HOME AND INTRODUCE ME WHEN WE GOT THERE A NEIGHBOR HAD TO FIND HIM JIM JIM HE CALLED
4379-18034-0042 AND THOSE TWO GREAT MEN
4379-18034-0043 THE OLD TIME RELIGION GARFIELD ESPECIALLY LOVED IT SO HE TOLD US BECAUSE THE GOOD OLD MAN WHO BROUGHT HIM UP AS A BOY AND TO WHOM HE OWED SUCH GRATITUDE USED TO SING IT
4379-18034-0044 AT THE PASTURE BARS OUTSIDE OF THE BOY'S WINDOW EVERY MORNING AND YOUNG JIM KNEW
4379-18034-0045 HE SAID THAT HE HAD HEARD
4379-18034-0046 I FORGET WHAT REASON THERE WAS FOR MC KINLEY'S ESPECIALLY LIKING IT BUT
4379-18034-0047 MONOTONE MUSIC IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR MOTHER
4379-18034-0048 THUS IT WENT ON WITH NEVER WEARYING
4379-18034-0049 THE OLD TIME RELIGION THE OLD TIME RELIGION THE OLD TIME RELIGION IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME
4379-18034-0050 WITH TWO OF THE VANISHED GREAT ONES OF THE EARTH STOOD BEFORE HIS PEOPLE LEADING THEM SINGING WITH THEM HIS EYES AGLOW WITH AN INWARD LIGHT HIS MAGIC HAD SUDDENLY
4379-18034-0051 THE DAYS OF PIONEERING AND HARDSHIP WHEN RELIGION MEANT SO MUCH TO EVERYBODY AND EVEN THOSE WHO KNEW NOTHING OF SUCH THINGS FELT THEM EVEN IF BUT VAGUELY EVERY HEART WAS MOVED AND TOUCHED
4379-18034-0052 WILL SING IN THE MEMORY OF ALL
