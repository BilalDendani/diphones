7229-80665-0015 CRIED NAN CONSCIENCE STRICKEN IN SPITE OF THE BEATING RAIN AND WIND SHE GOT TO HER KNEES STILL CLINGING TO HER BIG COUSIN AND THEN STOOD UPON THE BROAD TONGUE OF THE WAGON
7229-80665-0016 THE HORSES STOOD STILL WITH THEIR HEADS DOWN BEARING THE BUFFETING OF THE STORM WITH THE USUAL PATIENCE OF DUMB BEASTS A SHEER WALL OF WATER SEEMED TO SEPARATE THEM FROM EVERY OBJECT OUT UPON THE OPEN LAND
7229-80665-0017 BEHIND THEM THE BULK OF THE FOREST LOOMED AS ANOTHER BARRIER NAN HAD REALLY NEVER BELIEVED THAT RAIN COULD FALL SO HARD IT ALMOST TOOK HER BREATH
7229-80665-0018 MOREOVER WHAT TOM SAID ABOUT THE SMOKING TREE BEGAN TO TROUBLE THE GIRL SHE THOUGHT OF THE FIRE AT PALE LICK OF WHICH SHE HAD RECEIVED HINTS FROM SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT

7229-80665-0021 ASKED HER COUSIN YES THERE FOR THE MOMENT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THE DOWNPOUR LIGHTENED VEILED BY THE STILL FALLING WATER A STRAIGHT STICK ROSE HIGH IN THE AIR AHEAD OF THEM
7229-80665-0022 TOM CHIRRUPED TO THE HORSES AND MADE THEM THOUGH UNWILLING GO FORWARD THEY DRAGGED THE HEAVY CART UNEVENLY THROUGH THE HEAVY DOWNPOUR THE TRAIL WAS HARD TO FOLLOW
7229-80665-0023 AND ONCE IN A WHILE A REAR WHEEL BUMPED OVER A STUMP AND NAN WAS GLAD TO DROP DOWN UPON THE TONGUE AGAIN AND CLING MORE TIGHTLY THAN EVER TO HER COUSIN'S COLLAR SURE THAT'S IT QUERIED TOM
7229-80665-0024 CRANING HIS NECK TO LOOK UP INTO THE TALL STRAIGHT TREE I I'M ALMOST SURE STAMMERED NAN I DON'T SEE ANY SMOKE DRAWLED TOM WITH HIS HEAD STILL RAISED
7229-80665-0025 THE RAIN HAD ALMOST CEASED AN INTERMISSION WHICH WOULD NOT BE OF LONG DURATION NAN SAW THAT HER COUSIN'S PROPHECY HAD BEEN TRUE THE GROUND ACTUALLY SMOKED AFTER THE DOWNPOUR
7229-80665-0026 THE SUN HEATED SAWDUST STEAMED FURIOUSLY THEY SEEMED TO BE CROSSING A HEATED CAULDRON CLOUDS OF STEAM ROSE ALL ABOUT THE TIMBER CART WHY TOMMY
7229-80665-0027 NAN CHOKED IT DOES SEEM AS THOUGH THERE MUST BE FIRE UNDER THIS SAWDUST NOW TOM BROUGHT HIS OWN GAZE DOWN FROM THE EMPTY TREE TOP WITH A JERK HOO HE SHOUTED AND LEANED FORWARD SUDDENLY
7229-80665-0028 TO FLICK HIS OFF HORSE WITH THE WHIPLASH JUST THEN THE REAR WHEEL ON THAT SIDE SLUMPED DOWN INTO WHAT SEEMED A VERITABLE VOLCANO
7229-80665-0029 FLAME AND SMOKE SPURTED OUT AROUND THE BROAD WHEEL NAN SCREAMED THE WIND SUDDENLY SWOOPED DOWN UPON THEM AND A BALL OF FIRE FLAMING SAWDUST WAS SHOT INTO THE AIR
7229-80665-0030 AND WAS TOSSED TWENTY FEET BY A PUFF OF WIND WE'RE OVER AN OVEN GASPED TOM AND LAID THE WHIP SOLIDLY ACROSS THE BACKS OF THE FRIGHTENED HORSES THEY PLUNGED
7229-80665-0031 ANOTHER GEYSER OF FIRE AND SMOKE SPURTED FROM THE HOLE INTO WHICH THE REAR WHEEL HAD SLUMPED AGAIN AND AGAIN THE BIG HORSES FLUNG THEMSELVES INTO THE COLLARS IN AN ENDEAVOR TO GET THE WHEEL OUT
7229-80665-0032 NO YOU WON'T DECLARED HER COUSIN LEAPING DOWN GET OFF AND RUN NAN BUT YOU DO AS I SAY COMMANDED TOM RUN
7229-80665-0033 TO GASPED THE GIRL LEAPING OFF THE TONGUE TOO AND AWAY FROM THE HORSES HEELS TO THE ROAD GET TOWARD HOME CRIED TOM RUNNING AROUND TO THE REAR OF THE TIMBER CART
7229-80665-0034 SHE MURMURED BUT HE DID NOT HEAR THAT HE HAD SEIZED HIS AXE AND WAS STRIDING TOWARD THE EDGE OF THE FOREST
7229-80665-0035 BUT THAT WOULD NOT BE LIKE TOM SHERWOOD AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST HE LAID THE AXE TO THE ROOT OF A SAPLING ABOUT FOUR INCHES THROUGH AT THE BUTT THREE STROKES AND THE TREE WAS DOWN
7229-80665-0036 IN A MINUTE HE HAD LOPPED OFF THE BRANCHES FOR TWENTY FEET THEN REMOVED THE TOP WITH A SINGLE BLOW AS HE TURNED DRAGGING THE POLE WITH HIM UP SPRANG THE FIRE AGAIN FROM THE HOLLOW INTO WHICH THE WHEEL OF THE WAGON HAD SUNK
7229-80665-0037 IT WAS A SMOKING FURNACE DOWN THERE AND SOON THE FELLOE AND SPOKES WOULD BE INJURED BY THE FLAMES AND HEAT SPARKS FLEW ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND FROM OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE HOLE
7229-80665-0038 SOME OF THEM SCATTERED ABOUT THE HORSES AND THEY PLUNGED AGAIN SQUEALING IT SEEMED TO NAN IMPOSSIBLE AFTER THE RECENT CLOUDBURST THAT THE FIRE COULD FIND ANYTHING TO FEED UPON
7229-80665-0039 BUT UNDERNEATH THE PACKED SURFACE OF THE SAWDUST THE HEAT OF SUMMER HAD BEEN DRYING OUT THE MOISTURE FOR WEEKS AND THE FIRE HAD BEEN SMOULDERING FOR A LONG TIME PERHAPS FOR YARDS AND YARDS AROUND
7229-80665-0040 THE INTERIOR OF THE SAWDUST HEAP WAS A GLOWING FURNACE NAN WOULD NOT RUN AWAY AND TOM DID NOT SEE HER AS HE CAME PLUNGING BACK TO THE STALLED WAGON
7229-80665-0041 SUDDENLY HIS FOOT SLUMPED INTO THE YIELDING SAWDUST AND HE FELL UPON HIS FACE HE CRIED OUT WITH SURPRISE OR PAIN NAN HORRIFIED SAW THE FLAMES AND SMOKE SHOOTING OUT OF THE HOLE INTO WHICH HER COUSIN HAD STEPPED
7229-80665-0042 FOR THE MOMENT THE GIRL FELT AS IF HER HEART HAD STOPPED BEATING OH TOM OH TOM SHE SHRIEKED AND SPRANG TOWARD HIM TOM WAS STRUGGLING TO GET UP
7229-80665-0043 HIS RIGHT LEG HAD GONE INTO THE YIELDING MASS UP TO HIS HIP AND DESPITE HIS STRUGGLES HE COULD NOT GET IT OUT A LONG YELLOW FLAME SHOT OUT OF THE HOLE AND ALMOST LICKED HIS FACE
7229-80665-0044 IT INDEED SCORCHED HIS HAIR ON ONE SIDE OF HIS HEAD BUT NAN DID NOT SCREAM AGAIN SHE NEEDED HER BREATH ALL THAT SHE COULD GET FOR A MORE PRACTICAL PURPOSE HER COUSIN WAVED HER BACK FEEBLY
7229-80665-0045 AND TRIED TO TELL HER TO AVOID THE FIRE NAN RUSHED IN GOT BEHIND HIM AND SEIZED HER COUSIN UNDER THE ARMS
