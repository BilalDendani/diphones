5649-40582-0000 FROM GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH'S HISTORIA BRITONUM ARTHUR SUCCEEDS UTHER HIS FATHER IN THE KINGDOM OF BRITAIN AND BESIEGES COLGRIN UTHER PENDRAGON BEING DEAD
5649-40582-0001 THE NOBILITY FROM SEVERAL PROVINCES ASSEMBLED TOGETHER AT SILCHESTER AND PROPOSED TO DUBRICIUS ARCHBISHOP OF LEGIONS THAT HE SHOULD CONSECRATE ARTHUR
5649-40582-0002 DUBRICIUS THEREFORE GRIEVING FOR THE CALAMITIES OF HIS COUNTRY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER BISHOPS SET THE CROWN UPON ARTHUR'S HEAD ARTHUR WAS THEN ONLY FIFTEEN YEARS OLD BUT A YOUTH OF SUCH UNPARALLELED COURAGE AND GENEROSITY
5649-40582-0003 JOINED WITH THAT SWEETNESS OF TEMPER AND INNATE GOODNESS AS GAINED FOR HIM UNIVERSAL LOVE WHEN HIS CORONATION WAS OVER HE ACCORDING TO USUAL CUSTOM
5649-40582-0004 AND SUCH A NUMBER OF SOLDIERS FLOCKED TO HIM UPON IT THAT HIS TREASURY WAS NOT ABLE TO ANSWER THAT VAST EXPENSE BUT SUCH A SPIRIT OF GENEROSITY JOINED WITH VALOR CAN NEVER LONG WANT MEANS TO SUPPORT ITSELF
5649-40582-0005 ARTHUR THEREFORE THE BETTER TO KEEP UP HIS MUNIFICENCE RESOLVED TO MAKE USE OF HIS COURAGE AND TO FALL UPON THE SAXONS THAT HE MIGHT ENRICH HIS FOLLOWERS WITH THEIR WEALTH TO THIS HE WAS ALSO MOVED BY THE JUSTICE OF THE CAUSE
5649-40582-0006 SINCE THE ENTIRE MONARCHY OF BRITAIN BELONGED TO HIM BY HEREDITARY RIGHT HEREUPON ASSEMBLING THE YOUTH UNDER HIS COMMAND HE MARCHED TO YORK OF WHICH WHEN COLGRIN HAD INTELLIGENCE HE MET WITH A VERY GREAT ARMY
5649-40582-0007 COMPOSED OF SAXONS SCOTS AND PICTS BY THE RIVER DUGLAS WHERE A BATTLE HAPPENED WITH THE LOSS OF THE GREATER PART OF BOTH ARMIES NOTWITHSTANDING THE VICTORY FELL TO ARTHUR WHO PURSUED COLGRIN TO YORK AND THERE BESIEGED HIM
5649-40582-0008 DUBRICIUS'S SPEECH AGAINST THE TREACHEROUS SAXONS OF WHOM ARTHUR SLAYS MANY IN BATTLE WHEN HE HAD DONE SPEAKING SAINT DUBRICIUS ARCHBISHOP OF LEGIONS GOING TO THE TOP OF A HILL CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE
5649-40582-0009 WHOSE SUFFERINGS BY THE TREACHERY OF THE PAGANS WILL BE AN EVERLASTING REPROACH TO YOU IF YOU DO NOT COURAGEOUSLY DEFEND THEM IT IS YOUR COUNTRY WHICH YOU FIGHT FOR AND FOR WHICH YOU SHOULD WHEN REQUIRED VOLUNTARILY SUFFER DEATH
5649-40582-0010 FOR THAT ITSELF IS VICTORY AND THE CURE OF THE SOUL FOR HE THAT SHALL DIE FOR HIS BRETHREN OFFERS HIMSELF A LIVING SACRIFICE TO GOD AND HAS CHRIST FOR HIS EXAMPLE WHO CONDESCENDED TO LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR HIS BRETHREN
5649-40582-0011 INSTANTLY ARMED THEMSELVES UPON ARTHUR'S SHIELD THE PICTURE OF THE BLESSED MARY MOTHER OF GOD WAS PAINTED IN ORDER TO PUT HIM FREQUENTLY IN MIND OF HER IN THIS MANNER WAS A GREAT PART OF THAT DAY ALSO SPENT WHEREUPON ARTHUR
5649-40582-0012 RUSHED FORWARD WITH GREAT FURY INTO THE THICKEST OF THE ENEMY'S RANKS OF WHOM SUCH WAS THE MERIT OF HIS PRAYERS NOT ONE ESCAPED ALIVE THAT FELT THE FURY OF HIS SWORD NEITHER DID HE GIVE OVER THE FURY OF HIS ASSAULT UNTIL HE HAD
5649-40582-0013 WITH HIS CALIBURN ALONE KILLED FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MEN THE BRITONS SEEING THIS FOLLOWED THEIR LEADER IN GREAT MULTITUDES AND MADE SLAUGHTER ON ALL SIDES SO THAT COLGRIN AND BALDULPH HIS BROTHER
5649-40582-0014 FELL BEFORE THEM BUT CHELDRIC IN HIS IMMINENT DANGER OF HIS MEN BETOOK HIMSELF TO FLIGHT ARTHUR INCREASES HIS DOMINIONS
5649-40582-0015 AFTER THIS HAVING INVITED OVER TO HIM ALL PERSONS WHATSOEVER THAT WERE FAMOUS FOR VALOR IN FOREIGN NATIONS HE BEGAN TO AUGMENT THE NUMBER OF HIS DOMESTICS
5649-40582-0016 AND INTRODUCED SUCH POLITENESS INTO HIS COURT AS PEOPLE OF THE REMOTEST COUNTRIES THOUGHT WORTHY OF THEIR IMITATION SO THAT THERE WAS NOT A NOBLEMAN WHO THOUGHT HIMSELF OF ANY CONSIDERATION
5649-40582-0017 UNLESS HIS CLOTHES AND ARMS WERE MADE IN THE SAME FASHION AS THOSE OF ARTHUR'S KNIGHTS AT LENGTH THE FAME OF HIS MUNIFICENCE AND VALOR SPREADING OVER THE WHOLE WORLD HE BECAME A TERROR TO THE KINGS OF OTHER COUNTRIES
5649-40582-0018 WHO GRIEVOUSLY FEARED THE LOSS OF THEIR DOMINIONS IF HE SHOULD MAKE ANY ATTEMPT UPON THEM ARTHUR FORMED A DESIGN FOR THE CONQUEST OF ALL EUROPE AT THE END OF NINE YEARS IN WHICH TIME ALL THE PARTS OF GAUL WERE ENTIRELY REDUCED
5649-40582-0019 ARTHUR RETURNED BACK TO PARIS WHERE HE KEPT HIS COURT AND CALLING AN ASSEMBLY OF THE CLERGY AND PEOPLE ESTABLISHED PEACE AND THE JUST ADMINISTRATION OF THE LAWS IN THAT KINGDOM THEN HE BESTOWED NEUSTRIA
5649-40582-0020 THUS HAVING SETTLED THE PEACE OF THE CITIES AND THE COUNTRIES THERE HE RETURNED BACK IN THE BEGINNING OF SPRING TO BRITAIN ARTHUR HOLDS A SOLEMN FESTIVAL UPON THE APPROACH OF THE FEAST OF PENTECOST
5649-40582-0021 AND FOR THE MORE SOLEMN OBSERVATION OF THAT FESTIVAL AND RECONCILING THE MINDS OF THE PRINCES THAT WERE NOW SUBJECT TO HIM RESOLVED DURING THAT SEASON TO HOLD A MAGNIFICENT COURT TO PLACE THE CROWN UPON HIS HEAD
5649-40582-0022 AND TO INVITE ALL THE KINGS AND DUKES UNDER HIS SUBJECTION TO THE SOLEMNITY
5649-40582-0023 HE PITCHED UPON THE CITY OF LEGIONS AS A PROPER PLACE FOR HIS PURPOSE
5649-40582-0024 UPON THE RIVER USKE NEAR THE SEVERN SEA WAS MOST PLEASANT AND FIT FOR SO GREAT A SOLEMNITY FOR ON ONE SIDE IT WAS WASHED BY THAT NOBLE RIVER SO THAT THE KINGS AND PRINCES FROM THE COUNTRIES BEYOND THE SEAS
5649-40582-0025 MIGHT HAVE THE CONVENIENCE OF SAILING UP TO IT ON THE OTHER SIDE THE BEAUTY OF THE MEADOWS AND GROVES AND MAGNIFICENCE OF THE ROYAL PALACES WITH LOFTY GILDED ROOFS THAT ADORNED IT MADE IT EVEN RIVAL THE GRANDEUR OF ROME
5649-40582-0026 IT WAS ALSO FAMOUS FOR TWO CHURCHES WHEREOF ONE WAS BUILT IN HONOR OF THE MARTYR JULIUS AND ADORNED WITH A CHOIR OF VIRGINS WHO HAD DEVOTED THEMSELVES WHOLLY TO THE SERVICE OF GOD BUT THE OTHER WHICH WAS FOUNDED IN MEMORY OF SAINT AARON
5649-40582-0027 HIS COMPANION AND MAINTAINED A CONVENT OF CANONS WAS THE THIRD METROPOLITAN CHURCH OF BRITAIN BESIDES THERE WAS A COLLEGE OF TWO HUNDRED PHILOSOPHERS WHO BEING LEARNED IN ASTRONOMY AND THE OTHER ARTS
5649-40582-0028 AND GAVE ARTHUR TRUE PREDICTIONS OF THE EVENTS THAT WOULD HAPPEN AT THAT TIME IN THIS PLACE THEREFORE WHICH AFFORDED SUCH DELIGHTS WERE PREPARATIONS MADE FOR THE ENSUING FESTIVAL
5649-40582-0029 MADE HIMSELF READY TO CELEBRATE THE OFFICE AND UNDERTOOK THE ORDERING OF WHATEVER RELATED TO IT AS SOON AS THE KING WAS INVESTED WITH HIS ROYAL HABILIMENTS HE WAS CONDUCTED IN GREAT POMP TO THE METROPOLITAN CHURCH
5649-40582-0030 SUPPORTED ON EACH SIDE BY TWO ARCHBISHOPS AND HAVING FOUR KINGS VIZ OF ALBANIA CORNWALL DEMETIA AND VENEDOTIA WHOSE RIGHT IT WAS BEARING FOUR GOLDEN SWORDS BEFORE HIM
5649-40582-0031 WHICH MADE MOST EXCELLENT HARMONY ON ANOTHER PART WAS THE QUEEN DRESSED OUT IN HER RICHEST ORNAMENTS CONDUCTED BY THE ARCHBISHOPS AND BISHOPS TO THE TEMPLE OF VIRGINS THE FOUR QUEENS ALSO OF THE KINGS LAST MENTIONED
5649-40582-0032 BEARING BEFORE HER FOUR WHITE DOVES ACCORDING TO ANCIENT CUSTOM AND AFTER HER THERE FOLLOWED A RETINUE OF WOMEN MAKING ALL IMAGINABLE DEMONSTRATIONS OF JOY WHEN THE WHOLE PROCESSION WAS ENDED
5649-40582-0033 SO TRANSPORTING WAS THE HARMONY OF THE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND VOICES WHEREOF THERE WAS A VAST VARIETY IN BOTH CHURCHES THAT THE KNIGHTS WHO ATTENDED WERE IN DOUBT WHICH TO PREFER AND THEREFORE CROWDED FROM THE ONE TO THE OTHER BY TURNS
5649-40582-0034 AND WERE FAR FROM BEING TIRED WITH THE SOLEMNITY THOUGH THE WHOLE DAY HAD BEEN SPENT IN IT AT LAST WHEN DIVINE SERVICE WAS OVER AT BOTH CHURCHES THE KING AND QUEEN PUT OFF THEIR CROWNS AND PUTTING ON THEIR LIGHTER ORNAMENTS WENT TO THE BANQUET
5649-40582-0035 HE TO ONE PALACE WITH THE MEN SHE TO ANOTHER WITH THE WOMEN FOR THE BRITONS STILL OBSERVED THE ANCIENT CUSTOM OF TROY BY WHICH THE MEN AND WOMEN USED TO CELEBRATE THEIR FESTIVALS APART WHEN THEY HAD ALL TAKEN THEIR SEATS ACCORDING TO PRECEDENCE
5649-40582-0036 WHO WAITED WITH ALL KINDS OF CUPS AND DRINKING VESSELS IN THE QUEEN'S PALACE WERE INNUMERABLE WAITERS DRESSED WITH VARIETY OF ORNAMENTS ALL PERFORMING THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICES WHICH IF I SHOULD DESCRIBE PARTICULARLY
5649-40582-0037 I SHOULD DRAW OUT THE HISTORY TO A TEDIOUS LENGTH FOR AT THAT TIME BRITAIN HAD ARRIVED AT SUCH A PITCH OF GRANDEUR THAT IN ABUNDANCE OF RICHES LUXURY OF ORNAMENTS AND POLITENESS OF INHABITANTS IT FAR SURPASSED ALL OTHER KINGDOMS
5649-40582-0038 AND ESTEEMED NONE WORTHY OF THEIR LOVE BUT SUCH AS HAD GIVEN A PROOF OF THEIR VALOR IN THREE SEVERAL BATTLES THUS WAS THE VALOR OF THE MEN AN ENCOURAGEMENT FOR THE WOMEN'S CHASTITY AND THE LOVE OF THE WOMEN A SPUR TO THE SOLDIERS BRAVERY
5649-40582-0039 AFTER A VARIETY OF SPORTS AT THE CORONATION ARTHUR AMPLY REWARDS HIS SERVANTS AS SOON AS THE BANQUETS WERE OVER THEY WENT INTO THE FIELDS WITHOUT THE CITY TO DIVERT THEMSELVES WITH VARIOUS SPORTS THE MILITARY MEN
