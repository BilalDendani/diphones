2380-152158-0000 THERE WAS NOT A SOUND THAT STILLNESS WEIRD UNNERVING THAT PERMEATED AS IT WERE EVERYWHERE THROUGH THAT MYSTERIOUS HOUSE WAS IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE ACCENTUATED NOW
2380-152158-0001 THE FOUR MASKED MEN IN EVENING DRESS FIVE INCLUDING THEIR LEADER FOR THE MAN WHO HAD APPEARED IN THAT OTHER ROOM WITH THE RABBIT WAS NOT HERE WERE AS SILENT AS MOTIONLESS AS THE DEAD MAN WHO WAS LASHED THERE IN THE CHAIR
2380-152158-0002 AND TO JIMMIE DALE IT SEEMED AT FIRST AS THOUGH HIS BRAIN STUNNED AND STUPEFIED AT THE SHOCK REFUSED ITS FUNCTIONS AND LEFT HIM GROPING BLINDLY VAGUELY
2380-152158-0003 IMMINENT HANGING OVER HIM HE TRIED TO ROUSE HIMSELF MENTALLY TO PROD HIS BRAIN TO ACTION TO PIT IT IN A FIGHT FOR LIFE AGAINST THESE SELF CONFESSED CRIMINALS AND MURDERERS WITH THEIR MASK OF CULTURE WHO SURROUNDED HIM NOW
2380-152158-0004 WAS THERE A WAY OUT WHAT WAS IT THE TOCSIN HAD SAID THE MOST POWERFUL AND PITILESS ORGANISATION OF CRIMINALS THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN THE STAKE A FORTUNE OF MILLIONS HER LIFE THERE HAD INDEED BEEN NO OVEREMPHASIS IN THE WORDS SHE HAD USED
2380-152158-0005 THEY HAD TAKEN PAINS THEMSELVES TO MAKE THAT OMINOUSLY CLEAR THESE MEN EVERY DETAIL OF THE STRANGE HOUSE WITH ITS LUXURIOUS FURNISHINGS ITS CLEVERLY CONTRIVED APPOINTMENTS BREATHED A HORRIBLY SUGGESTIVE DEGREE OF POWER
2380-152158-0006 A DEADLY PURPOSE AND AN ORGANISATION SWAYED BY A MASTER MIND AND GRIM EVIDENCE OF THE MERCILESS INEXORABLE LENGTH TO WHICH THEY WOULD GO WAS THE GHASTLY WHITE FACE OF THE DEAD CHAUFFEUR BOUND HAND AND FOOT IN THE CHAIR BEFORE HIM
2380-152158-0007 THAT EMPTY GLASS IN THE HAND OF ONE OF THE MEN HE COULD NOT TAKE HIS EYES FROM IT EXCEPT AS HIS EYES WERE DRAWN MAGNETICALLY TO THAT FULL GLASS IN THE HAND OF ONE OF THE OTHERS WHAT HEIGHT OF SARDONIC IRONY
2380-152158-0008 HE WAS TO DRINK THAT OTHER GLASS TO DIE BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT FOR YEARS WITH EVERY RESOURCE AT HIS COMMAND RISKING HIS LIBERTY HIS WEALTH HIS NAME HIS LIFE WITH EVERYTHING THAT HE CARED FOR THROWN INTO THE SCALES
2380-152158-0009 HE HAD STRUGGLED TO SOLVE AND FAILED AND THEN THE LEADER SPOKE MISTER DALE HE SAID WITH COLD SIGNIFICANCE I REGRET TO ADMIT THAT YOUR PSEUDO TAXICAB DRIVER
2380-152158-0010 WAS SO ILL ADVISED AS TO REFUSE TO ANSWER THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE PUT TO YOU FIVE TO ONE THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY OUT AND IT WAS HOPELESS IT WAS THE ONLY WAY OUT BECAUSE CONVINCED
2380-152158-0011 THAT HE COULD ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS IF HE WANTED TO THESE MEN WERE IN DEADLY EARNEST IT WAS HOPELESS BECAUSE THEY WERE FIVE TO ONE AND PROBABLY THERE WERE AS MANY MORE TWICE OR THREE TIMES AS MANY MORE WITHIN CALL
2380-152158-0012 BUT WHAT DID IT MATTER HOW MANY MORE THERE WERE HE COULD FIGHT UNTIL HE WAS OVERPOWERED THAT WAS ALL HE COULD DO AND THE FIVE COULD ACCOMPLISH THAT STILL IF HE COULD KNOCK THE FULL GLASS OUT OF THAT MAN'S HAND AND GAIN THE DOOR
2380-152158-0013 THEN PERHAPS HE TURNED QUICKLY AS THE DOOR OPENED IT WAS AS THOUGH THEY HAD READ HIS THOUGHTS A NUMBER OF MEN WERE GROUPED OUTSIDE IN THE CORRIDOR THEN THE DOOR CLOSED AGAIN WITH A CORDON RANGED AGAINST IT INSIDE THE ROOM
2380-152158-0014 AND AT THE SAME INSTANT HIS ARMS AND WRISTS WERE CAUGHT IN A POWERFUL GRASP BY THE TWO MEN IMMEDIATELY BEHIND HIM WHO ALL ALONG HAD ENACTED THE ROLE OF GUARDS AGAIN THE LEADER SPOKE I WILL REPEAT THE QUESTIONS HE SAID SHARPLY
2380-152158-0015 WHERE IS THE WOMAN WHOSE RING WAS FOUND ON THAT MAN THERE IN THE CHAIR AND WHERE IS THE PACKAGE THAT YOU TWO MEN HAD WITH YOU IN THE TAXICAB TO NIGHT JIMMIE DALE GLANCED FROM THE TALL STRAIGHT IMMACULATELY CLOTHED FIGURE OF THE SPEAKER
2380-152158-0016 FROM THE THREATENING SMILE ON THE SET LIPS THAT JUST SHOWED UNDER THE EDGE OF THE MASK TO THE DEAD MAN IN THE CHAIR HE HAD FACED THE PROSPECT OF DEATH BEFORE MANY TIMES
2380-152158-0017 IT HAD COME QUICKLY ABRUPTLY WITH EVERY FACULTY CALLED INTO ACTION TO COMBAT IT WITHOUT TIME TO DWELL UPON IT TO SIFT WEIGH OR MEASURE ITS MEANING AND IF THERE HAD BEEN FEAR IT HAD BEEN SUBORDINATE TO OTHER EMOTIONS BUT IT WAS DIFFERENT NOW
2380-152158-0018 NOR HE WAS DOGGEDLY CONSCIOUS WOULD HE HAVE ANSWERED THEM IF HE COULD AND THERE WAS NO MIDDLE COURSE DEATH WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MOMENTS STARED HIM IN THE FACE AND IT SEEMED CURIOUSLY IRRELEVANT THAT IN A SORT OF UNNATURAL CALMNESS
2380-152158-0019 AND EMOTIONS CONCERNING IT ALL HIS LIFE IT HAD SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE ACME OF HUMAN MENTAL TORTURE WAS THE CELL OF A CONDEMNED CRIMINAL WITH THE HORROR OF ITS HOPELESSNESS WITH THE TIME TO DWELL UPON IT
2380-152158-0020 AND THAT THE ACME OF THAT TORTURE ITSELF MUST BE THAT AWFUL MOMENT IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING EXECUTION WHEN ANTICIPATION AT LAST WAS TO MERGE INTO SOUL SICKENING REALITY STRANGE THAT THOUGHT SHOULD COME
2380-152158-0021 STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE FRAMING A BRAIN PICTURE OF SUCH A SCENE VIVID MINUTE IN DETAIL NO NOT STRANGE HE WAS PICTURING HIMSELF THE ANALOGY WAS NOT PERFECT IT WAS TRUE
2380-152158-0022 HE HAD NOT HAD THE MONTHS WEEKS DAYS AND HOURS OF SUSPENSE BUT IT WAS PERFECT ENOUGH TO BRING HOME TO HIM WITH APPALLING FORCE THE REALISATION OF HIS POSITION HE WAS STANDING AS A CONDEMNED MAN MIGHT STAND IN THOSE LAST FINAL MOMENTS
2380-152158-0023 THOSE MOMENTS WHICH HE HAD IMAGINED MUST BE THE MOST TERRIBLE THAT COULD EXIST IN LIFE BUT THAT DISMAY OF SOUL THE HORROR THE TERROR WERE NOT HIS THERE WAS INSTEAD A SMOULDERING FURY A PASSIONATE AMAZEMENT
2380-152158-0024 THAT WAS THREATENED IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT IT COULD BE HIS VOICE THAT WAS SPEAKING NOW IN SUCH QUIET MEASURED TONES IS IT WORTH WHILE WILL IT CONVINCE YOU NOW ANY MORE THAN BEFORE TO REPEAT THAT THERE IS SOME MISTAKE HERE
2380-152158-0025 I AM NO MORE ABLE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS THAN YOU ARE YOURSELVES I NEVER SAW THAT MAN IN THE CHAIR THERE IN MY LIFE UNTIL THE MOMENT THAT I HAILED HIM IN HIS CAB TO NIGHT I DO NOT KNOW WHO THE WOMAN IS TO WHOM THAT RING BELONGS
2380-152158-0026 AND IF THERE WAS A PACKAGE OF ANY SORT IN THE TAXICAB AS YOU STATE I NEVER SAW IT THE LIPS UNDER THE MASK CURVED INTO A LUPINE SMILE THINK WELL MISTER DALE THE MAN'S VOICE WAS LOW MENACING ETHICALLY
2380-152158-0027 IF YOU SO CHOOSE TO CONSIDER IT YOUR REFUSAL MAY BE THE ACT OF A BRAVE MAN
2380-152158-0028 NOW YOUR ANSWER I HAVE ANSWERED YOU SAID JIMMIE DALE AND RELAXING THE MUSCLES IN HIS ARMS LET THEM HANG LIMPLY FOR AN INSTANT IN THE GRIP OF THE TWO MEN BEHIND HIM I HAVE NO OTHER ANSWER IT WAS ONLY A SIGN A MOTION OF THE LEADER'S HAND
2380-152158-0029 BUT WITH IT QUICK AS A LIGHTNING FLASH JIMMIE DALE WAS IN ACTION THE LIMP ARMS TAUTENED INTO STEEL AS HE WRENCHED THEM LOOSE AND WHIRLING AROUND
2380-152158-0030 IN AN INSTANT WITH THE BLOW AS THE MAN STAGGERED BACKWARD THE ROOM WAS IN PANDEMONIUM THERE WAS A RUSH FROM THE DOOR AND TWO THREE FOUR LEAPING FORMS HURLED THEMSELVES UPON JIMMIE DALE HE SHOOK THEM OFF AND THEY CAME AGAIN
2380-152158-0031 THERE WAS NO CHANCE ULTIMATELY HE KNEW THAT IT WAS ONLY THE ELEMENTAL WITHIN HIM THAT ROSE IN FIERCE REVOLT AT THE THOUGHT OF TAME SUBMISSION THAT BADE HIM SELL HIS LIFE AS DEARLY AS HE COULD
2380-152158-0032 PANTING GASPING FOR BREATH DRAGGING THEM BY SHEER STRENGTH AS THEY CLUNG TO HIM HE GOT HIS BACK TO THE WALL FIGHTING WITH THE SAVAGE FURY AND ABANDON OF A WILD CAT BUT IT COULD NOT LAST
2380-152158-0033 WHERE ONE MAN WENT DOWN BEFORE HIM TWO REMORSELESSLY APPEARED THE ROOM SEEMED FILLED WITH MEN THEY POURED IN THROUGH THE DOOR HE LAUGHED AT THEM IN A HALF DEMENTED WAY MORE AND MORE OF THEM CAME
2380-152158-0034 THERE WAS NO PLAY FOR HIS ARMS NO ROOM TO FIGHT THEY SEEMED SO CLOSE AROUND HIM SO MANY OF THEM UPON HIM THAT HE COULD NOT BREATHE AND HE WAS BENDING BEING CRUSHED DOWN
2380-152158-0035 AND THEN HIS FEET WERE JERKED FROM BENEATH HIM HE CRASHED TO THE FLOOR AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT BOUND HAND AND FOOT HE WAS TIED INTO A CHAIR BESIDE THAT OTHER CHAIR WHOSE GRIM OCCUPANT SAT IN SUCH GHASTLY APATHY OF THE SCENE
2380-152158-0036 THE ROOM CLEARED INSTANTLY OF ALL BUT THE ORIGINAL FIVE HIS HEAD WAS DRAWN SUDDENLY VIOLENTLY BACKWARD AND CLAMPED IN THAT POSITION AND A METAL INSTRUMENT FORCED INTO HIS MOUTH
2380-152158-0037 PRIED JAWS APART AND HELD THEM OPEN ONE DROP THE LEADER ORDERED CURTLY THE MAN WITH THE FULL GLASS BENT OVER HIM AND DIPPED A GLASS ROD INTO THE LIQUID THE DROP GLISTENED A RUBY RED ON THE END OF THE ROD
2380-152158-0038 AND FELL WITH A SHARP ACRID BURNING SENSATION UPON JIMMIE DALE'S TONGUE FOR A MOMENT JIMMIE DALE'S ANIMATION MENTAL AND PHYSICAL SEEMED SWEPT AWAY FROM HIM IN AS IT WERE A HIATUS OF HIDEOUS SUSPENSE
2380-152158-0039 WHAT WAS IT TO BE LIKE THIS PASSING
2380-152158-0040 THEY HAD SHOWED HIM IN THE OTHER ROOM YES HE REMEMBERED IT TOOK MORE THAN ONE DROP FOR A MAN AND BESIDES THIS WAS DILUTED ONE DROP HAD NO EFFECT ON A MAN IT REQUIRED GOOD GOD ONE DROP EVEN OF THIS WAS ENOUGH
2380-152158-0041 HE STRAINED FORWARD IN THE CHAIR UNTIL THE SWEAT IN GREAT BEADS SPRANG FROM HIS FOREHEAD
2380-152158-0042 OF MADNESS TO FREE HIMSELF WHILE THERE STILL REMAINED A LITTLE STRENGTH THERE WAS SOMETHING FILMING BEFORE HIS EYES A NUMBED FEELING WAS CREEPING THROUGH HIS LIMBS ROBBING THEM SAPPING THEM OF THEIR VITALITY AND POWER
2380-152158-0043 HE FELT HIMSELF SLIPPING AWAY INTO A STATE OF UTTER WEAKNESS AND HIS BRAIN BEGAN TO GROW CONFUSED A VOICE SEEMED TO FLOAT IN THE AIR NEAR HIM FOR THE LAST TIME WILL YOU ANSWER
2380-152158-0044 WITH A SUPREME EFFORT JIMMIE DALE STROVE TO RALLY HIS TOTTERING SENSES DID THEY NOT UNDERSTAND THE STUPENDOUS MOCKERY OF THEIR QUESTIONS DID THEY NOT UNDERSTAND THAT HE DID NOT KNOW HE HAD TOLD THEM SO PERHAPS
2380-152158-0045 HE HAD BETTER TELL THEM SO AGAIN I HE TRIED TO SPEAK AND FOUND THE WORDS THICK UPON HIS TONGUE I DO NOT KNOW THE GLASS ITSELF WAS THRUST ABRUPTLY BETWEEN HIS LIPS
2380-152158-0046 SOME OF THE CONTENTS SPILLED AND TRICKLED UPON HIS CHIN AND THEN A FLOOD OF IT
2380-152158-0047 POURED DOWN HIS THROAT A FLOOD OF IT AND IT NEEDED BUT THREE DROPS AND THERE HAD BEEN TEN IN THE GLASS SO THIS WAS DEATH A HAZY NEBULOUS THING THERE WAS NO PAIN IT WAS LIKE LIKE NOTHINGNESS
2380-152158-0048 STRANGE THAT SHE SHOULD COME ALONE SHE HAD FOUGHT THESE FIENDS AND OUTWITTED THEM FOR HOW LONG WAS IT THREE YEARS SHE WOULD BE MORE THAN EVER ALONE NOW PRAY GOD SHE DID NOT FINALLY FALL INTO THEIR CLUTCHES
2380-152158-0049 AND HOW IT GRIPPED AT HIM AND SEEMED TO EAT AND BORE ITS WAY INTO THE VERY TISSUES IT WAS THE END AND NO IT WAS STIMULATING HIM STRENGTH SEEMED TO BE RETURNING TO HIS LIMBS
2380-152158-0050 AS THOUGH THE BONDS ABOUT HIM WERE BEING LOOSENED AND NOW HIS BRAIN SEEMED TO BE GROWING CLEARER HE ROUSED UP WITH A STARTLED EXCLAMATION
2380-152158-0051 HE WAS BACK IN THE SAME ROOM IN WHICH HE HAD FIRST RETURNED TO CONSCIOUSNESS AFTER THE ACCIDENT HE WAS ON THE SAME COUCH THE SAME MASKED FIGURE WAS AT THE SAME DESK HAD HE BEEN DREAMING WAS THIS THEN
2380-152158-0052 ONLY SOME HORRIBLE GHASTLY NIGHTMARE THROUGH WHICH HE HAD PASSED NO IT HAD BEEN REAL ENOUGH HIS CLOTHES RENT AND TORN AND THE BLOOD UPON HIS HANDS WHERE THE SKIN HAD BEEN SCRAPED FROM HIS KNUCKLES IN THE FIGHT BORE EVIDENCE TO THAT
2380-152158-0053 THOUGH IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT AT NO MOMENT HAZY IRRATIONAL THOUGH HIS BRAIN MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAD HE BECOME ENTIRELY OBLIVIOUS TO WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE AROUND HIM
2380-152158-0054 AND YET IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO THE EYES FROM BEHIND THE MASK WERE FIXED STEADILY UPON HIM AND BELOW THE MASK THERE WAS THE HARD UNPLEASANT SET
2380-152158-0055 THE MAN SPOKE ABRUPTLY THAT YOU FIND YOURSELF ALIVE MISTER DALE HE SAID GRIMLY IS NO CONFESSION OF WEAKNESS UPON THE PART OF THOSE WITH WHOM YOU HAVE HAD TO DEAL HERE TO BEAR WITNESS TO THAT
2380-152158-0056 THERE IS ONE WHO IS NOT ALIVE AS YOU HAVE SEEN THAT MAN WE KNEW WITH YOU IT WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT YOUR PRESENCE IN THE TAXICAB WAS ONLY SUSPICIOUS THERE WAS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT YOU MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE
2380-152158-0057 UBIQUITOUS INNOCENT BYSTANDERS YOUR NAME YOUR POSITION THE IMPROBABILITY THAT YOU COULD HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON WITH SHALL WE SAY THE MATTER THAT SO DEEPLY INTERESTS US WAS ALL IN YOUR FAVOUR
2380-152158-0058 HOWEVER PRESUMPTION AND PROBABILITY ARE THE TOOLS OF FOOLS WE DO NOT DEPEND UPON THEM WE APPLY THE TEST AND HAVING APPLIED THE TEST WE ARE CONVINCED THAT YOU HAVE TOLD THE TRUTH THAT IS ALL
2380-152158-0059 HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR BRUSQUELY I SHALL NOT APOLOGISE TO YOU FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED
2380-152158-0060 I IMAGINE RATHER THAT YOU ARE PROMISING YOURSELF THAT WE SHALL PAY AND PAY DEARLY FOR THIS
2380-152158-0061 ALL THIS WILL BE QUITE WITHIN YOUR PROVINCE MISTER DALE AND QUITE FRUITLESS TO MORROW MORNING THE STORY THAT YOU ARE PREPARING TO TELL NOW WOULD SOUND INCREDIBLE EVEN IN YOUR OWN EARS FURTHERMORE AS WE SHALL TAKE PAINS TO SEE THAT YOU LEAVE
2380-152158-0062 THIS PLACE WITH AS LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF ITS LOCATION AS YOU OBTAINED WHEN YOU ARRIVED YOUR STORY EVEN IF BELIEVED WOULD DO LITTLE SERVICE TO YOU AND LESS HARM TO US I THINK OF NOTHING MORE MISTER DALE EXCEPT
2380-152158-0063 THERE WAS A WHIMSICAL SMILE ON THE LIPS NOW AH YES THE MATTER OF YOUR CLOTHES WE CAN AND SHALL BE GLAD TO MAKE REPARATION TO YOU TO THE SLIGHT EXTENT OF OFFERING YOU A NEW SUIT BEFORE YOU GO
2380-152158-0064 JIMMIE DALE SCOWLED SICK SHAKEN AND WEAK AS HE WAS THE COOL IMPERTURBABLE IMPUDENCE OF THE MAN WAS FAST GROWING UNBEARABLE THE MAN LAUGHED I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT REFUSE MISTER DALE SINCE WE INSIST
2380-152158-0065 IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY OF COURSE BUT WE PREFER TO DISCOUNT EVEN SO REMOTE A POSSIBILITY WHEN YOU HAVE CHANGED YOU WILL BE MOTORED BACK TO YOUR HOME I BID YOU GOOD NIGHT MISTER DALE JIMMIE DALE RUBBED HIS EYES
2380-152158-0066 THE MAN WAS GONE THROUGH A DOOR AT THE REAR OF THE DESK A DOOR THAT HE HAD NOT NOTICED BEFORE THAT WAS NOT EVEN IN EVIDENCE NOW THAT WAS SIMPLY A MOVABLE SECTION OF THE WALL PANELLING
2380-152158-0067 AND FOR AN INSTANT JIMMIE DALE EXPERIENCED A SENSE OF SICKENING IMPOTENCE IT WAS AS THOUGH HE STOOD DEFENCELESS UNARMED AND UTTERLY AT THE MERCY OF SOME VENOMOUS POWER
2380-152158-0068 AND AT WILL IN ITS MIGHT THE PLACE WAS A VERITABLE MAZE A LAIR OF HELLISH CLEVERNESS HE HAD NO ILLUSIONS NOW HE LABOURED UNDER NO FALSE ESTIMATE OF EITHER THE INGENUITY OR THE RESOURCES OF THIS INHUMAN NEST OF VULTURES
2380-152158-0069 TO WHOM MURDER WAS NO MORE THAN A MATTER OF DETAIL
2380-152158-0070 THERE COULD BE NO TRUCE NO ARMISTICE
2380-152158-0071 WELL HE WAS ALIVE NOW THE FIRST ROUND WAS OVER AND SO FAR HE HAD WON HIS BROWS FURROWED SUDDENLY HAD HE HE WAS NOT SO SURE AFTER ALL HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A DISQUIETING PREMONITORY INTUITION THAT IN SOME WAY
2380-152158-0072 HE WAS APPARENTLY THE APPARENTLY WAS A MENTAL RESERVATION QUITE ALONE IN THE ROOM HE GOT UP FROM THE COUCH AND WALKED SHAKILY ACROSS THE FLOOR TO THE DESK A REVOLVER LAY INVITINGLY UPON THE BLOTTING PAD IT WAS HIS OWN
2380-152158-0073 THE ONE THEY HAD TAKEN FROM HIM AFTER THE ACCIDENT JIMMIE DALE PICKED IT UP EXAMINED IT AND SMILED A LITTLE SARCASTICALLY
2380-152158-0074 IT WAS UNLOADED OF COURSE HE WAS TWIRLING IT IN HIS HAND AS A MAN MASKED AS EVERY ONE IN THE HOUSE WAS MASKED AND CARRYING A NEATLY FOLDED SUIT OVER HIS ARM ENTERED FROM THE CORRIDOR
2380-152158-0075 THE CAR IS READY AS SOON AS YOU ARE DRESSED ANNOUNCED THE OTHER BRIEFLY HE LAID THE CLOTHES UPON THE COUCH AND SETTLED HIMSELF SIGNIFICANTLY IN A CHAIR JIMMIE DALE HESITATED THEN WITH A SHRUG OF HIS SHOULDERS RECROSSED THE ROOM
2380-152158-0076 AND BEGAN TO REMOVE HIS TORN GARMENTS WHAT WAS THE USE THEY WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE THEIR OWN WAY IN THE END IT WASN'T WORTH ANOTHER FIGHT AND THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE GAINED BY A REFUSAL EXCEPT TO OFFER A SOP TO HIS OWN EXASPERATION
2380-152158-0077 HE DRESSED QUICKLY IN WHAT PROVED TO BE AN EXCEEDINGLY WELL FITTING SUIT AND FINALLY TURNED TENTATIVELY TO THE MAN IN THE CHAIR THE OTHER STOOD UP AND PRODUCED A HEAVY BLACK SILK SCARF
