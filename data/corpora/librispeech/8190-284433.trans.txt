8190-284433-0023 BUT GHIP GHISIZZLE ADVISED HIM TO KEEP THIS DOOR LOCKED AS THE CITY PEOPLE WOULD BE SURE TO HURT THE STRANGERS IF THEY HAD THE CHANCE TO ATTACK THEM YOU'RE SAFER IN THE PALACE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE SAID THE MAJORDOMO FOR THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN ESCAPE FROM THE ISLAND

8190-284433-0030 ALL RIGHT ANSWERED THE GUARD OUR BOOLOOROO IS IN AN UGLY MOOD TO NIGHT IT WILL GO HARD WITH THIS LITTLE SHORT NECKED CREATURE IF HE DOESN'T POLISH THE SHOES PROPERLY THEN GHIP GHISIZZLE LEFT BUTTON BRIGHT AND WENT AWAY AND THE BOY PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL ROOMS TO THE ROYAL BEDCHAMBER
8190-284433-0031 WHERE HIS MAJESTY SAT UNDRESSING HI THERE WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE HE ROARED AS HE SAW BUTTON BRIGHT I'VE COME FOR THE SHOES SAID THE BOY THE KING THREW THEM AT HIS HEAD AIMING CAREFULLY BUT BUTTON BRIGHT DODGED THE MISSILES
8190-284433-0032 AND ONE SMASHED A MIRROR WHILE THE OTHER SHATTERED A VASE ON A SMALL TABLE HIS MAJESTY LOOKED AROUND FOR SOMETHING ELSE TO THROW BUT THE BOY SEIZED THE SHOES AND RAN AWAY RETURNING TO HIS OWN ROOM WHILE HE POLISHED THE SHOES HE TOLD HIS PLANS TO CAP'N BILL AND TROT
8190-284433-0033 AND ASKED THEM TO BE READY TO FLY WITH HIM AS SOON AS HE RETURNED WITH THE MAGIC UMBRELLA ALL THEY NEED TO DO WAS TO STEP OUT INTO THE STREET THROUGH THE DOOR OF CAP'N BILL'S ROOM AND OPEN THE UMBRELLA
8190-284433-0034 AND THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO PREVENT THEIR QUICKLY STARTING ON THE JOURNEY HOME
8190-284433-0035 SO IT WAS AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN BUTTON BRIGHT FINALLY TOOK THE SHOES IN HIS HAND AND STARTED FOR THE ROYAL BEDCHAMBER HE PASSED THE GUARD OF THE ROYAL TREASURY AND FREDJIM NODDED GOOD NATUREDLY TO THE BOY BUT THE SLEEPY GUARD BEFORE THE KING'S APARTMENTS WAS CROSS AND SURLY

8190-284433-0037 THIS THREAT FRIGHTENED THE LONG NECKED GUARD WHO DID NOT KNOW WHAT ORDERS THE BOOLOOROO HAD GIVEN HIS ROYAL BOOTBLUE
8190-284433-0038 I'LL BE QUIET PROMISED THE BOY INDEED BUTTON BRIGHT HAD NO DESIRE TO WAKEN THE BOOLOOROO WHOM HE FOUND SNORING LUSTILY WITH THE CURTAINS OF HIS HIGH POSTED BED DRAWN TIGHTLY AROUND HIM THE BOY HAD TAKEN OFF HIS OWN SHOES AFTER HE PASSED THE GUARD
8190-284433-0039 AND NOW HE TIPTOED CAREFULLY INTO THE ROOM SET DOWN THE ROYAL SHOES VERY GENTLY AND THEN CREPT TO THE CHAIR WHERE HIS MAJESTY'S CLOTHES WERE PILED
8190-284433-0040 AT ONCE HE DECIDED THIS MUST BE THE KEY TO THE TREASURE CHAMBER BUT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE HE SEARCHED IN EVERY OTHER POCKET WITHOUT FINDING ANOTHER KEY
8190-284433-0041 THEN BUTTON BRIGHT CREPT SOFTLY OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN AND IN ONE OF THE OUTER ROOMS HE SAT DOWN NEAR A BIG CABINET AND PUT ON HIS SHOES POOR BUTTON BRIGHT DID NOT KNOW THAT LYING DISREGARDED BENEATH THAT VERY CABINET AT HIS SIDE WAS THE PRECIOUS UMBRELLA HE WAS SEEKING
8190-284433-0042 OR THAT HE WAS UNDERTAKING A DESPERATE ADVENTURE ALL FOR NOTHING HE PASSED THE LONG NECKED GUARD AGAIN FINDING THE MAN HALF ASLEEP AND THEN MADE HIS WAY TO THE TREASURE CHAMBER FACING JIMFRED HE SAID TO THE PATCHED MAN IN A SERIOUS TONE
8190-284433-0043 HIS MAJESTY COMMANDS YOU TO GO AT ONCE TO THE CORRIDOR LEADING TO THE APARTMENTS OF THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES AND TO GUARD THE ENTRANCE UNTIL MORNING YOU ARE TO PERMIT NO ONE TO ENTER OR TO LEAVE THE APARTMENTS
8190-284433-0044 WHO WILL GUARD THE TREASURE CHAMBER I AM TO TAKE YOUR PLACE SAID BUTTON BRIGHT
8190-284433-0045 THIS IS A QUEER FREAK FOR OUR BOOLOOROO TO INDULGE IN
8190-284433-0046 YOU'RE NOT MUCH OF A GUARD SEEMS TO ME BUT IF ANYONE TRIES TO ROB THE TREASURE CHAMBER YOU MUST RING THIS BIG GONG WHICH WILL ALARM THE WHOLE PALACE
8190-284433-0047 YES SAID BUTTON BRIGHT THEN FREDJIM STALKED AWAY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PALACE TO GUARD THE PRINCESSES AND BUTTON BRIGHT WAS LEFT ALONE WITH THE KEY TO THE TREASURE CHAMBER IN HIS HAND BUT HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THAT THE FEROCIOUS BLUE WOLF WAS GUARDING THE INTERIOR OF THE CHAMBER
8190-284433-0048 SO HE SEARCHED IN SOME OF THE ROOMS UNTIL HE FOUND A SOFA PILLOW WHICH HE PUT UNDER HIS ARM AND THEN RETURNED TO THE CORRIDOR HE PLACED THE KEY IN THE LOCK AND THE BOLT TURNED WITH A SHARP CLICK BUTTON BRIGHT DID NOT HESITATE
8190-284433-0049 HE WAS AFRAID TO BE SURE AND HIS HEART WAS BEATING FAST WITH THE EXCITEMENT OF THE MOMENT BUT HE KNEW HE MUST REGAIN THE MAGIC UMBRELLA IF HE WOULD SAVE HIS COMRADES AND HIMSELF FROM DESTRUCTION FOR WITHOUT IT THEY COULD NEVER RETURN TO THE EARTH
