1827-143625-0000 WHEN A MAN PRIDES HIMSELF ON BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND INTERPRET THE WRITINGS OF CHRYSIPPUS SAY TO YOURSELF IF CHRYSIPPUS HAD NOT WRITTEN OBSCURELY THIS FELLOW WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING TO BE PROUD OF BUT WHAT IS IT THAT I DESIRE
1827-143625-0001 TO UNDERSTAND NATURE AND TO FOLLOW HER ACCORDINGLY I ASK WHO IS THE INTERPRETER ON HEARING THAT IT IS CHRYSIPPUS I GO TO HIM BUT IT SEEMS I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WROTE SO I SEEK ONE TO INTERPRET THAT
