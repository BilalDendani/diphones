4021-180238-0000 STARTING FROM THE HALL A FEW MINUTES BEFORE DOCTOR MIDDLETON AND SIR WILLOUGHBY HAD ENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM OVERNIGHT VERNON PARTED COMPANY WITH COLONEL DE CRAYE AT THE PARK GATES AND BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE COTTAGE OF THE DALES WHERE
4021-180238-0001 GIFTED WITH THE LIVES OF A CAT BECAME VIOLENT AND RAPPED PUNCH LIKE BLOWS ON THE WINDOW SILL AT VERNON'S REFUSAL TO TAKE SHELTER AND REST VERNON'S EXCUSE WAS THAT HE HAD
4021-180238-0002 NO ONE BUT THAT FELLOW TO CARE FOR AND HE STRODE OFF NAMING A FARM FIVE MILES DISTANT DOCTOR CORNEY HOWLED AN INVITATION TO EARLY BREAKFAST TO HIM IN THE EVENT OF HIS PASSING ON HIS WAY BACK AND RETIRED TO BED TO THINK OF HIM
4021-180238-0003 THE RESULT OF A VARIETY OF CONJECTURES CAUSED HIM TO SET VERNON DOWN AS MISS MIDDLETON'S KNIGHT AND HE FELT A STRONG COMPASSION FOR HIS POOR FRIEND THOUGH THOUGHT HE A HOPELESS ATTACHMENT IS AS PRETTY AN ACCOMPANIMENT
4021-180238-0004 TO THE TUNE OF LIFE AS A GENTLEMAN MIGHT WISH TO HAVE FOR IT'S ONE OF THOSE BIG DOSES OF DISCORD WHICH MAKE ALL THE MINOR ONES FIT IN LIKE AN AGREEABLE HARMONY AND SO HE SHUFFLES ALONG AS PLEASANTLY AS THE FORTUNE FAVOURED
4021-180238-0005 WHEN THEY COME TO COMPUTE SIR WILLOUGHBY WAS THE FORTUNE FAVOURED IN THE LITTLE DOCTOR'S MIND THAT HIGH STEPPING GENTLEMAN HAVING WEALTH AND PUBLIC CONSIDERATION AND THE MOST RAVISHING YOUNG LADY IN THE WORLD FOR A BRIDE
4021-180238-0006 STILL THOUGH HE RECKONED ALL THESE ADVANTAGES ENJOYED BY SIR WILLOUGHBY AT THEIR FULL VALUE HE COULD IMAGINE THE ULTIMATE BALANCE OF GOOD FORTUNE TO BE IN FAVOUR OF VERNON BUT TO DO SO HE HAD TO REDUCE THE WHOLE CALCULATION
4021-180238-0007 TO THE EXTREME ABSTRACT AND FEED HIS LEAN FRIEND AS IT WERE ON DEW AND ROOTS AND THE HAPPY EFFECT FOR VERNON LAY IN A DISTANT FUTURE ON THE BORDERS OF OLD AGE WHERE HE WAS TO BE BLESSED WITH HIS LADY'S REGRETFUL PREFERENCE
4021-180238-0008 THE REVIEWING MIND WAS IRISH SIR WILLOUGHBY WAS A CHARACTER OF MAN PROFOUNDLY OPPOSED TO DOCTOR CORNEY'S NATURE THE LATTER'S INSTINCTS BRISTLED WITH ANTAGONISM NOT TO HIS RACE FOR VERNON WAS OF THE SAME RACE
4021-180238-0009 WHILE IT HELD HIM SILENT AS IF UNDER A LAW HEAPED STORES OF INSURGENCY IN THE CELTIC BOSOM CORNEY CONTEMPLATING SIR WILLOUGHBY AND A TROTTING KERN GOVERNED BY STRONGBOW
4021-180238-0010 HAVE A POINT OF LIKENESS BETWEEN THEM WITH THE POINT OF DIFFERENCE THAT CORNEY WAS ENLIGHTENED TO KNOW OF A FRIEND BETTER ADAPTED FOR EMINENT STATION AND ESPECIALLY BETTER ADAPTED TO PLEASE A LOVELY LADY
4021-180238-0011 ANOTHER IDEA OF MANLINESS THAN THE FORMAL CARVED IN WOOD IDOL OF THEIR NATIONAL WORSHIP DOCTOR CORNEY BREAKFASTED VERY EARLY WITHOUT SEEING VERNON HE WAS OFF TO A PATIENT WHILE THE FIRST LARK OF THE MORNING CAROLLED ABOVE
4021-180238-0012 AND THE BUSINESS OF THE DAY NOT YET FALLEN UPON MEN IN THE SHAPE OF CLOUD WAS HAPPILY INTERMIXED WITH NATURE'S HUES AND PIPINGS TURNING OFF THE HIGH ROAD TIP A GREEN LANE AN HOUR LATER
4021-180238-0013 BY THE PECULIAR STRENUOUS TWIST
4021-180238-0014 INDICATIVE OF A FRAME PLUNGED ON THE PURSUIT IN HAND HE CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED YOUNG CROSSJAY OUT CAME EGGS THE DOCTOR PULLED UP WHAT BIRD HE BELLOWED YELLOWHAMMER CROSSJAY YELLED BACK
4021-180238-0015 NOW SIR YOU'LL DROP A COUPLE OF THOSE EGGS IN THE NEST DON'T ORDER ME CROSSJAY WAS RETORTING OH IT'S YOU DOCTOR CORNEY GOOD MORNING I SAID THAT BECAUSE I ALWAYS DO DROP A COUPLE BACK
4021-180238-0016 I PROMISED MISTER WHITFORD I WOULD AND MISS MIDDLETON TOO HAD BREAKFAST NOT YET NOT HUNGRY I SHOULD BE IF I THOUGHT ABOUT IT JUMP UP I THINK I'D RATHER NOT DOCTOR CORNEY
4021-180238-0017 YOU'RE FOND OF MISS MIDDLETON INSTEAD OF ANSWERING CROSSJAY HEAVED THE SIGH OF LOVE THAT BEARS A BURDEN AND SO AM I PURSUED THE DOCTOR YOU'LL HAVE TO PUT UP WITH A RIVAL IT'S WORSE THAN FOND I'M IN LOVE WITH HER
4021-180238-0018 HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT I DON'T MIND HOW MANY LOVE HER SAID CROSSJAY YOU'RE WORTHY OF A GRATUITOUS BREAKFAST IN THE FRONT PARLOUR OF THE BEST HOTEL OF THE PLACE THEY CALL ARCADIA
4021-180238-0019 AND HOW ABOUT YOUR BED LAST NIGHT PRETTY MIDDLING HARD WAS IT WHERE THE BONES HAVEN'T CUSHION
4021-180238-0020 BUT YOU'RE FOND OF MISS MIDDLETON ANYHOW AND THAT'S A VIRTUE TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE DOCTOR CORNEY BEHELD TWO BIG ROUND TEARS FORCE THEIR WAY OUT OF THIS TOUGH YOUNGSTER'S EYES AND ALL THE WHILE THE BOY'S FACE WAS PROUD
4021-180238-0021 CROSSJAY SAID WHEN HE COULD TRUST HIMSELF TO DISJOIN HIS LIPS I WANT TO SEE MISTER WHITFORD HAVE YOU GOT NEWS FOR HIM I'VE SOMETHING TO ASK HIM IT'S ABOUT WHAT I OUGHT TO DO
4021-180238-0022 THAT'S MELANCHOLY WHAT DO YOU SAY TO ASKING MY ADVICE CROSSJAY SIGHED I CAN'T SPEAK TO ANYBODY BUT MISTER WHITFORD AND YOU'RE HOT TO SPEAK TO HIM I WANT TO
4021-180238-0023 AND I FOUND YOU RUNNING AWAY FROM HIM YOU'RE A CURIOSITY MISTER CROSSJAY PATTERNE AH SO'D ANYBODY BE WHO KNEW AS MUCH AS I DO SAID CROSSJAY WITH A
4021-180238-0024 SOBER SADNESS THAT CAUSED THE DOCTOR TO TREAT HIM SERIOUSLY THE FACT IS HE SAID MISTER WHITFORD IS BEATING THE COUNTRY FOR YOU MY BEST PLAN WILL BE TO DRIVE YOU TO THE HALL I'D RATHER NOT GO TO THE HALL
4021-180238-0025 CROSSJAY SPOKE RESOLUTELY YOU WON'T SEE MISS MIDDLETON ANYWHERE BUT AT THE HALL I DON'T WANT TO SEE MISS MIDDLETON IF I CAN'T BE A BIT OF USE TO HER NO DANGER THREATENING THE LADY IS THERE
4021-180238-0026 CROSSJAY TREATED THE QUESTION AS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN PUT NOW TELL ME SAID DOCTOR CORNEY WOULD THERE BE A CHANCE FOR ME SUPPOSING MISS MIDDLETON WERE DISENGAGED THE ANSWER WAS EASY
4021-180238-0027 THE DOCTOR ASKED WHY AND CROSSJAY SAID IT WAS BECAUSE MISTER WHITFORD WAS THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD TO WHICH WITH A LUSTY AMEN TO THAT DOCTOR CORNEY REMARKED I SHOULD HAVE FANCIED COLONEL DE CRAYE WOULD HAVE HAD THE FIRST CHANCE
4021-180238-0028 HE'S MORE OF A LADY'S MAN CROSSJAY SURPRISED HIM AGAIN BY PETULANTLY SAYING DON'T THE BOY ADDED I DON'T WANT TO TALK EXCEPT ABOUT BIRDS AND THINGS WHAT A JOLLY MORNING IT IS I SAW THE SUN RISE NO RAIN TO DAY
4021-180238-0029 THE KINDLY LITTLE MAN SWUNG HIS WHIP CROSSJAY INFORMED HIM OF HIS DISGRACE AT THE HALL AND OF EVERY INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH IT FROM THE TRAMP TO THE BARONET SAVE MISS MIDDLETON'S ADVENTURE AND THE NIGHT SCENE IN THE DRAWING ROOM
4021-180238-0030 YOU'LL NOT LET MISS MIDDLETON KNOW OF MY AFFECTION AFTER ALL IT'S ONLY A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE BUT AS PATRICK SAID TO KATHLEEN WHEN SHE OWNED TO SUCH A LITTLE BIT THAT'S THE BEST BIT OF ALL
4021-180238-0031 AND HE WAS AS RIGHT AS I AM ABOUT HUNGRY CROSSJAY SCORNED TO TALK OF LOVING HE DECLARED I NEVER TELL MISS MIDDLETON WHAT I FEEL WHY THERE'S MISS DALE'S COTTAGE
4021-180238-0032 IT'S NEARER TO YOUR EMPTY INSIDE THAN MY MANSION SAID THE DOCTOR AND WE'LL STOP JUST TO INQUIRE WHETHER A BED'S TO BE HAD FOR YOU THERE TO NIGHT AND IF NOT I'LL HAVE YOU WITH ME AND BOTTLE YOU AND EXHIBIT YOU FOR YOU'RE A RARE SPECIMEN
4021-180238-0033 BREAKFAST YOU MAY COUNT ON FROM MISTER DALE I SPY A GENTLEMAN IT'S COLONEL DE CRAYE COME AFTER NEWS OF YOU I WONDER MISS MIDDLETON SENDS HIM OF COURSE SHE DOES CROSSJAY TURNED HIS FULL FACE TO THE DOCTOR
4021-180238-0034 I HAVEN'T SEEN HER FOR SUCH A LONG TIME BUT HE SAW ME LAST NIGHT AND HE MIGHT HAVE TOLD HER THAT IF SHE'S ANXIOUS GOOD MORNING COLONEL I'VE HAD A GOOD WALK AND A CAPITAL DRIVE AND I'M AS HUNGRY AS THE BOAT'S CREW OF CAPTAIN BLIGH
4021-180238-0035 HE JUMPED DOWN THE COLONEL AND THE DOCTOR SALUTED SMILING I'VE RUNG THE BELL SAID DE CRAYE A MAID CAME TO THE GATE AND UPON HER STEPS APPEARED MISS DALE WHO FLUNG HERSELF AT CROSSJAY MINGLING KISSES AND REPROACHES
4021-180238-0036 SHE SCARCELY RAISED HER FACE TO THE COLONEL MORE THAN TO REPLY TO HIS GREETING AND EXCUSE THE HUNGRY BOY FOR HURRYING INDOORS TO BREAKFAST I'LL WAIT SAID DE CRAYE HE HAD SEEN THAT SHE WAS PALER THAN USUAL SO HAD DOCTOR CORNEY
4021-180238-0037 AND THE DOCTOR CALLED TO HER CONCERNING HER FATHER'S HEALTH SHE REPORTED THAT HE HAD NOT YET RISEN AND TOOK CROSSJAY TO HERSELF THAT'S WELL SAID THE DOCTOR IF THE INVALID SLEEPS LONG THE LADY IS NOT LOOKING SO WELL THOUGH
4021-180238-0038 BUT LADIES VARY THEY SHOW THE MIND ON THE COUNTENANCE FOR WANT OF THE PUNCHING WE MEET WITH TO CONCEAL IT THEY'RE LIKE MILITARY FLAGS FOR A FUNERAL OR A GALA ONE DAY FURLED AND NEXT DAY STREAMING
4021-180238-0039 MEN ARE SHIPS FIGURE HEADS ABOUT THE SAME FOR A STORM OR A CALM AND NOT TOO HANDSOME THANKS TO THE OCEAN IT'S AN AGE SINCE WE ENCOUNTERED LAST COLONEL ON BOARD THE DUBLIN BOAT I RECOLLECT AND A NIGHT IT WAS
4021-180238-0040 THOUGH THE CURE OF THE SOUL IS OFTEN THE ENTIRE AND TOTAL CURE OF THE BODY AND IT'S MALICIOUSLY SAID THAT THE BODY GIVEN OVER TO OUR TREATMENT IS A SIGNAL TO SET THE SOUL FLYING BY THE WAY COLONEL THAT BOY HAS A TRIFLE ON HIS MIND
4021-180238-0041 DOCTOR CORNEY NODDED I HAVE TO VISIT MY PATIENT HERE PRESENTLY I'M TOO EARLY FOR HIM SO I'LL MAKE A CALL OR TWO ON THE LAME BIRDS THAT ARE UP HE REMARKED AND DROVE AWAY DE CRAYE STROLLED THROUGH THE GARDEN
4021-180238-0042 HE WAS A GENTLEMAN OF THOSE ACTIVELY PERCEPTIVE WITS WHICH IF EVER THEY REFLECT DO SO BY HOPS AND JUMPS UPON SOME DANCING MIRROR WITHIN WE MAY FANCY HE PENETRATED A PLOT IN A FLASH
4021-180238-0043 THREW A SERIES OF IMAGES OF EVERYTHING RELATING TO CROSSJAY FOR THE LAST FORTY HOURS INTO RELIEF BEFORE HIM AND AS HE DID NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE SPECULATE ON ANY ONE OF THEM BUT MERELY SHIFTED AND SURVEYED THEM
4021-180238-0044 GATHERS MATTER THAT MAKES THE SECRET THING DISCOURSE TO THE BRAIN BY WEIGHT AND BALANCE HE WILL GET EITHER THE RIGHT CLUE OR NONE MORE FREQUENTLY NONE BUT HE WILL ESCAPE THE ENTANGLEMENT OF HIS OWN CLEVERNESS
4021-180238-0045 HE WILL ALWAYS BE NEARER TO THE ENIGMA THAN THE GUESSER OR THE CALCULATOR AND HE WILL RETAIN A BREADTH OF VISION FORFEITED BY THEM HE MUST HOWEVER TO HAVE HIS CHANCE OF SUCCESS BE ACUTELY BESIDES CALMLY PERCEPTIVE
4021-180238-0046 A READER OF FEATURES AUDACIOUS AT THE PROPER MOMENT DE CRAYE WISHED TO LOOK AT MISS DALE
4021-180238-0047 OWING TO HER FATHER'S ILLNESS AND HE REMEMBERED A REDNESS OF HER EYELIDS WHEN HE PASSED HER ON THE CORRIDOR ONE NIGHT SHE SENT CROSSJAY OUT TO HIM AS SOON AS THE BOY WAS WELL FILLED HE SENT CROSSJAY BACK WITH A REQUEST
4021-180238-0048 SHE STEPPED TO THE FRONT DOOR RELUCTANTLY AND SEEMED DISCONCERTED DE CRAYE BEGGED FOR A MESSAGE TO MISS MIDDLETON THERE WAS NONE TO GIVE HE PERSISTED BUT THERE WAS REALLY NONE AT PRESENT SHE SAID
4021-180238-0049 YOU WON'T ENTRUST ME WITH THE SMALLEST WORD SAID HE AND SET HER VISIBLY THINKING WHETHER SHE COULD DISPATCH A WORD SHE COULD NOT SHE HAD NO HEART FOR MESSAGES
4021-180238-0050 I SHALL SEE HER IN A DAY OR TWO COLONEL DE CRAYE SHE WILL MISS YOU SEVERELY WE SHALL SOON MEET AND POOR WILLOUGHBY LAETITIA COLOURED AND STOOD SILENT
4021-180238-0051 A BUTTERFLY OF SOME RARITY ALLURED CROSSJAY I FEAR HE HAS BEEN DOING MISCHIEF SHE SAID I CANNOT GET HIM TO LOOK AT ME HIS APPETITE IS GOOD VERY GOOD INDEED DE CRAYE NODDED
4021-180238-0052 A BOY WITH A NOBLE APPETITE IS NEVER A HOPELESS LOCK THE COLONEL AND CROSSJAY LOUNGED OVER THE GARDEN AND NOW SAID THE COLONEL WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN'T ARRANGE A MEETING BETWEEN YOU AND MISS MIDDLETON
4021-180238-0053 YOU'RE A LUCKY FELLOW FOR SHE'S ALWAYS THINKING OF YOU I KNOW I'M ALWAYS THINKING OF HER SAID CROSSJAY IF EVER YOU'RE IN A SCRAPE SHE'S THE PERSON YOU MUST GO TO YES IF I KNOW WHERE SHE IS
4021-180238-0054 I WANT TO SEE MISTER WHITFORD SO MUCH HE SAID SOMETHING TO TELL HIM I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT THE SECRET WRIGGLED TO HIS MOUTH HE SWALLOWED IT DOWN YES
4021-180238-0055 I WANT TO TALK TO MISTER WHITFORD HE'S ANOTHER OF MISS MIDDLETON'S FRIENDS I KNOW HE IS HE'S TRUE STEEL WE'RE ALL HER FRIENDS CROSSJAY I FLATTER MYSELF I'M A TOLEDO WHEN I'M WANTED
4021-180238-0056 HOW LONG HAD YOU BEEN IN THE HOUSE LAST NIGHT BEFORE YOU RAN INTO ME I DON'T KNOW SIR I FELL ASLEEP FOR SOME TIME AND THEN I WOKE WHERE DID YOU FIND YOURSELF I WAS IN THE DRAWING ROOM
4021-180238-0057 WE COULDN'T BOX HIM OR PLAY CARDS OR STAND A CHANCE WITH HIM AS A RIVAL IN LOVE DID YOU NOW CATCH A SIGHT OF A GHOST THEY WEREN'T GHOSTS CROSSJAY SAID WHAT HE WAS SURE OF AND HIS VOICE PRONOUNCED HIS CONVICTION
4021-180238-0058 I DOUBT WHETHER MISS MIDDLETON IS PARTICULARLY HAPPY REMARKED THE COLONEL WHY WHY YOU UPSET HER YOU KNOW NOW AND THEN THE BOY SWELLED I'D DO I'D GO
4021-180238-0059 SO YOU MADE YOURSELF UP A COMFORTABLE BED IN THE DRAWING ROOM LUCKILY SIR WILLOUGHBY DIDN'T SEE YOU HE DIDN'T THOUGH A CLOSE SHAVE WAS IT
4021-180238-0060 THE SECRET THREATENED CROSSJAY TO BE OUT OR SUFFOCATE HIM DE CRAYE GAVE HIM A RESPITE YOU LIKE SIR WILLOUGHBY DON'T YOU CROSSJAY PRODUCED A STILL BORN AFFIRMATIVE HE'S KIND TO YOU SAID THE COLONEL
4021-180238-0061 HE'LL SET YOU UP AND LOOK AFTER YOUR INTERESTS YES I LIKE HIM SAID CROSSJAY WITH HIS CUSTOMARY RAPIDITY IN TOUCHING THE SUBJECT I LIKE HIM HE'S KIND AND ALL THAT AND TIPS AND PLAYS WITH YOU AND ALL THAT
4021-180238-0062 BUT I NEVER CAN MAKE OUT WHY HE WOULDN'T SEE MY FATHER WHEN MY FATHER CAME HERE TO SEE HIM TEN MILES AND HAD TO WALK BACK TEN MILES IN THE RAIN TO GO BY RAIL A LONG WAY DOWN HOME AS FAR AS DEVONPORT
4021-180238-0063 CAPTAIN PATTERNE IS AS BRAVE A MAN AS EVER LIVED SAID DE CRAYE I'M POSITIVE YOU'D LIKE HIM COLONEL I KNOW OF HIS DEEDS AND I ADMIRE HIM AND THAT'S A GOOD STEP TO LIKING HE WARMED THE BOY'S THOUGHTS OF HIS FATHER
4021-180238-0064 WE'RE VERY POOR AT HOME AND LOTS OF US AND ALL HUNGRY
4021-180238-0065 HE'S ONLY A MARINE HE'S A HERO SAID DE CRAYE HE CAME HOME VERY TIRED WITH A COLD AND HAD A DOCTOR BUT SIR WILLOUGHBY DID SEND HIM MONEY AND MOTHER WISHED TO SEND IT BACK
4021-180238-0066 AND MY FATHER SAID SHE WAS NOT LIKE A WOMAN WITH OUR BIG FAMILY HE SAID HE THOUGHT SIR WILLOUGHBY AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN NOT AT ALL VERY COMMON INDIGENOUS SAID DE CRAYE
4021-180238-0067 THE ART OF CUTTING IS ONE OF THE BRANCHES OF A POLITE EDUCATION IN THIS COUNTRY AND YOU'LL HAVE TO LEARN IT IF YOU EXPECT TO BE LOOKED ON AS A GENTLEMAN AND A PATTERNE MY BOY I BEGIN TO SEE HOW IT IS MISS MIDDLETON TAKES TO YOU SO
4021-180238-0068 FOLLOW HER DIRECTIONS BUT I HOPE YOU DID NOT LISTEN TO A PRIVATE CONVERSATION MISS MIDDLETON WOULD NOT APPROVE OF THAT
4021-180238-0069 THAT HIS MOTIVE WAS TO BE WELL IN ADVANCE OF VERNON WHITFORD TO WHOM AFTER ALL THE KNOWLEDGE IMPARTED BY CROSSJAY WOULD BE OF SMALL ADVANTAGE THAT FELLOW WOULD PROBABLY TROT OF TO WILLOUGHBY
4021-180238-0070 TO ROW HIM FOR BREAKING HIS WORD TO MISS MIDDLETON THERE ARE MEN THOUGHT DE CRAYE WHO SEE NOTHING FEEL NOTHING HE CROSSED A STILE INTO THE WOOD ABOVE THE LAKE WHERE AS HE WAS IN THE HUMOUR TO THINK HIMSELF SIGNALLY LUCKY
4021-180238-0071 ESPYING HER HE TOOK IT AS A MATTER OF COURSE THAT THE LADY WHO TAUGHT HIS HEART TO LEAP SHOULD BE POSTED BY THE FATES AND HE WONDERED LITTLE AT HER POWER FOR RARELY HAD THE WORLD SEEN SUCH UNION OF PRINCESS AND
4021-180238-0072 SYLPH AS IN THAT LADY'S FIGURE SHE STOOD HOLDING BY A BEECH BRANCH GAZING DOWN ON THE WATER SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIM
4021-180238-0073 BUT SHE WAS NOT STARTLED THE COLOUR OVERFLOWED A GRAVE FACE AND TIS NOT QUITE THE FIRST TIME THAT WILLOUGHBY HAS PLAYED THIS TRICK DE CRAYE SAID TO HER KEENLY SMILING WITH A PARTED MOUTH
4021-180238-0074 CLARA MOVED HER LIPS TO RECALL REMARKS INTRODUCTORY TO SO ABRUPT AND STRANGE A PLUNGE HE SMILED IN THAT PECULIAR MANNER OF AN ILLUMINATED COMIC PERCEPTION FOR THE MOMENT HE WAS ALL FALCON AND HE SURPRISED HIMSELF MORE THAN CLARA WHO
4021-180238-0075 WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO TAKE SURPRISES IT WAS THE SIGHT OF HER WHICH HAD ANIMATED HIM TO STRIKE HIS GAME HE WAS DOWN ON IT ANOTHER INSTINCT AT WORK THEY SPRING UP IN TWENTIES OFTENER THAN IN TWOS WHEN THE HEART IS THE HUNTER
4021-180238-0076 PROMPTED HIM TO DIRECTNESS AND QUICKNESS TO CARRY HER ON THE FLOOD OF THE DISCOVERY SHE REGAINED SOMETHING OF HER MENTAL SELF POSSESSION AS SOON AS SHE WAS ON A LEVEL WITH A MEANING SHE HAD NOT YET INSPECTED BUT SHE HAD TO SUBMIT TO HIS LEAD
4021-180238-0077 DISTINCTLY PERCEIVING WHERE ITS DRIFT DIVIDED TO THE FORKED CURRENTS OF WHAT MIGHT BE IN HIS MIND AND WHAT WAS IN HERS MISS MIDDLETON I BEAR A BIT OF A LIKENESS TO THE MESSENGER TO THE GLORIOUS DESPOT
4021-180238-0078 MY HEAD IS OFF IF I SPEAK NOT TRUE EVERYTHING I HAVE IS ON THE DIE DID I GUESS WRONG YOUR WISH I READ IT IN THE DARK BY THE HEART BUT HERE'S A CERTAINTY WILLOUGHBY SETS YOU FREE

4021-180238-0081 I HAVE REASON TO KNOW IT CANNOT BE IF I HAVE A HEAD IT IS A FRESH AND BLOOMING TRUTH AND MORE I STAKE MY VANITY ON IT LET ME GO TO HER SHE STEPPED CONSIDER SAID HE
4021-180238-0082 MISS DALE AND I ARE EXCELLENT FRIENDS IT WOULD NOT SEEM INDELICATE TO HER SHE HAS A KIND OF REGARD FOR ME THROUGH CROSSJAY OH CAN IT BE THERE MUST BE SOME DELUSION YOU HAVE SEEN
4021-180238-0083 YOU WISH TO BE OF SERVICE TO ME YOU MAY TOO EASILY BE DECEIVED LAST NIGHT HE LAST NIGHT AND THIS MORNING TIS NOT THE FIRST TIME OUR FRIEND HAS PLAYED THE TRICK MISS MIDDLETON BUT THIS IS INCREDIBLE THAT LAST NIGHT
4021-180238-0084 I THINK I FELT THAT WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU WILL YOU LET ME HEAR WHY YOU ARE SO CERTAIN MISS MIDDLETON WHEN I FIRST HAD THE HONOUR OF LOOKING ON YOU IT WAS IN A POSTURE THAT NECESSITATED MY LOOKING UP
4021-180238-0085 HIMSELF IS THE PRINCIPAL CONSIDERATION WITH HIMSELF AND EVER WAS YOU DISCOVERED IT SAID CLARA HE UNCOVERED IT SAID DE CRAYE THE MIRACLE WAS THAT THE WORLD WOULDN'T SEE
4021-180238-0086 BUT THE WORLD IS A PIGGY WIGGY WORLD FOR THE WEALTHY FELLOW WHO FILLS A TROUGH FOR IT AND THAT HE HAS ALWAYS VERY SAGACIOUSLY DONE ONLY WOMEN BESIDES MYSELF HAVE DETECTED HIM I HAVE NEVER EXPOSED HIM I HAVE BEEN AN OBSERVER PURE AND SIMPLE
4021-180238-0087 AND BECAUSE I APPREHENDED ANOTHER CATASTROPHE MAKING SOMETHING LIKE THE FOURTH TO MY KNOWLEDGE ONE BEING PUBLIC YOU KNEW MISS DURHAM AND HARRY OXFORD TOO AND THEY'RE A PAIR AS HAPPY AS BLACKBIRDS IN A CHERRY TREE
4021-180238-0088 IN A SUMMER SUNRISE WITH THE OWNER OF THE GARDEN ASLEEP BECAUSE OF THAT APPREHENSION OF MINE I REFUSED THE OFFICE OF BEST MAN TILL WILLOUGHBY HAD SENT ME A THIRD LETTER HE INSISTED ON MY COMING I CAME SAW
4021-180238-0089 AND WAS CONQUERED I TRUST WITH ALL MY SOUL I DID NOT BETRAY MYSELF I OWED THAT DUTY TO MY POSITION OF CONCEALING IT AS FOR ENTIRELY HIDING THAT I HAD USED MY EYES I CAN'T SAY THEY MUST ANSWER FOR IT
4021-180238-0090 THE COLONEL WAS USING HIS EYES WITH AN INCREASING SUAVITY THAT THREATENED MORE THAN SWEETNESS I BELIEVE YOU HAVE BEEN SINCERELY KIND SAID CLARA WE WILL DESCEND TO THE PATH ROUND THE LAKE SHE DID NOT REFUSE HER HAND ON THE DESCENT
4021-180238-0091 AND HE LET IT ESCAPE THE MOMENT THE SERVICE WAS DONE AS HE WAS PERFORMING THE ADMIRABLE CHARACTER OF THE MAN OF HONOUR HE HAD TO ATTEND TO THE OBSERVANCE OF DETAILS AND SURE OF HER THOUGH HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL
4021-180238-0092 THERE WAS A TOUCH OF THE UNKNOWN IN CLARA MIDDLETON WHICH MADE HIM FEAR TO STAMP ASSURANCE DESPITE A BARELY RESISTIBLE IMPULSE COMING OF HIS EMOTIONS AND APPROVED BY HIS MAXIMS
4021-180238-0093 WILLOUGHBY SETTLED HIS CHANCE WAS GREAT WHO ELSE WAS IN THE WAY NO ONE HE COUNSELLED HIMSELF TO WAIT FOR HER SHE MIGHT HAVE IDEAS OF DELICACY HER FACE WAS TROUBLED SPECULATIVE
4021-180238-0094 THE BROWS CLOUDED THE LIPS COMPRESSED YOU HAVE NOT HEARD THIS FROM MISS DALE SHE SAID LAST NIGHT THEY WERE TOGETHER THIS MORNING SHE FLED I SAW HER THIS MORNING DISTRESSED
4021-180238-0095 SHE IS UNWILLING TO SEND YOU A MESSAGE SHE TALKS VAGUELY OF MEETING YOU SOME DAYS HENCE AND IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME HE HAS GONE TO HER FOR HIS CONSOLATION THAT IS NOT A PROPOSAL CLARA REFLECTED HE IS TOO PRUDENT
4021-180238-0096 HE DID NOT PROPOSE TO HER AT THE TIME YOU MENTION HAVE YOU NOT BEEN HASTY COLONEL DE CRAYE SHADOWS CROSSED HER FOREHEAD SHE GLANCED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE AND STOPPED HER WALK LAST NIGHT MISS MIDDLETON
4021-180238-0097 THERE WAS A LISTENER WHO CROSSJAY WAS UNDER THAT PRETTY SILK COVERLET WORKED BY THE MISS PATTERNES HE CAME HOME LATE FOUND HIS DOOR LOCKED AND DASHED DOWNSTAIRS INTO THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE HE SNUGGLED UP AND DROPPED ASLEEP
4021-180238-0098 THE TWO SPEAKERS WOKE HIM THEY FRIGHTENED THE POOR DEAR LAD IN HIS LOVE FOR YOU AND AFTER THEY HAD GONE HE WANTED TO RUN OUT OF THE HOUSE AND I MET HIM JUST AFTER I HAD COME BACK FROM MY SEARCH BURSTING AND TOOK HIM TO MY ROOM AND LAID HIM ON THE SOFA
4021-180238-0099 CORNEY TOLD ME THE BOY HAD YOU ON HIS BRAIN AND WAS MISERABLE SO CROSSJAY AND I HAD A TALK CROSSJAY DID NOT REPEAT TO YOU THE CONVERSATION HE HAD HEARD SAID CLARA NO SHE SMILED REJOICINGLY PROUD OF THE BOY AS SHE WALKED ON
4021-180238-0100 SUCH A MAN COULD DO ANYTHING THAT CONCLUSION FORTIFIED HER TO PURSUE HER WALK TO THE HOUSE AND GIVE BATTLE FOR FREEDOM WILLOUGHBY APPEARED TO HER SCARCE HUMAN UNREADABLE SAVE BY THE KEY THAT SHE COULD SUPPLY
4021-180238-0101 SHE DETERMINED TO PUT FAITH IN COLONEL DE CRAYE'S MARVELLOUS DIVINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE DARK MARVELS ARE SOLID WEAPONS WHEN WE ARE ATTACKED BY REAL PRODIGIES OF NATURE HER COUNTENANCE CLEARED
4021-180238-0102 SHE CONVERSED WITH DE CRAYE OF THE POLITE AND THE POLITICAL WORLD THROWING OFF HER PERSONAL BURDEN COMPLETELY AND CHARMING HIM AT THE EDGE OF THE GARDEN ON THE BRIDGE THAT CROSSED THE HAHA FROM THE PARK HE HAD A SECOND IMPULSE
