4295-39940-0000 AFTER STUDYING THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES WE HAVE SKETCHED THE WHOLE FIELD OF DISTURBANCES IN WHICH PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INFLUENCE MIGHT BE POSSIBLE AND ALL THE METHODS AVAILABLE IT SEEMS NATURAL THAT OUR NEXT STEP
4295-39940-0001 AS THIS IS NOT A HANDBOOK FOR THE PHYSICIAN
4295-39940-0002 WE EMPHASIZED BEFORE THAT WE AVOID EVEN ANY ATTEMPT IN SUCH A DIRECTION BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE TO INTRODUCE NOT ONLY THE QUESTIONS OF DIAGNOSIS BUT ABOVE ALL THE HIGHLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OF TREATMENT
4295-39940-0003 BY PHYSICAL AGENCIES WE SAW THAT FOR US NOTHING ELSE CAN BE DESIRABLE BUT TO SHOW THE WAY IN WHICH THE VARIOUS SYMPTOMS WHICH SUGGEST MENTAL TREATMENT OCCUR
4295-39940-0004 THAT FOR A FIRST SURVEY WE MIGHT SEPARATE THE MENTAL FROM THE BODILY SYMPTOMS AND GROUP THE MENTAL ONES WITH REFERENCE TO THE PREDOMINANCE OF IDEATIONAL EMOTIONAL AND VOLITIONAL FACTORS
4295-39940-0005 AND THE SIMPLEST COUNTRY PHYSICIAN SURELY EVERY WEEK THUS I TURN FROM SYSTEMATIC OBJECTIVITY TO MY UNSYSTEMATIC REMINISCENCES OF MANY YEARS
4295-39940-0006 OF COURSE THEY ABOUND WITH ECCENTRIC ABNORMITIES AND STARTLING PHENOMENA AS I HAVE DEVOTED MYSELF TO PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICS
4295-39940-0007 ALWAYS AND ONLY FROM SCIENTIFIC INTEREST AS A PART OF MY LABORATORY STUDIES AND THEREFORE HAVE REFUSED TO SPEND ANY TIME ON CASES WHICH OFFERED NO SPECIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL INTEREST TO ME THE STRIKING AND SENSATIONAL CASES HAVE PREVAILED IN MY PRACTICE EVEN TO AN UNUSUAL DEGREE
4295-39940-0008 YET THEY ARE UNESSENTIAL FOR OUR PURPOSES HERE THE MORE AS THEIR INTEREST LIES MOSTLY IN THE COMPLEX STRUCTURE OF THE MENTAL STATE
4295-39940-0009 OUR PURPOSE OF DEMONSTRATING PRACTICAL CASES AS THEY OCCUR IN EVERY VILLAGE AND AS THEY OUGHT TO BE UNDERSTOOD AND TREATED BY EVERY DOCTOR THUS RULES OUT JUST THOSE EXPERIENCES
4295-39940-0010 WHICH WOULD BE PROMINENT IN A THEORETICAL STUDY OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY WE WANT TO SELECT ONLY SIMPLE COMMONPLACE CASES ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE NOT LEARNED TO SEE ARE UNAWARE
4295-39940-0011 THAT SUCH CASES ARE EVERYWHERE ABOUT THEM AS A MATTER OF COURSE I ALSO LEAVE OUT EVERYTHING WHICH REFERS TO INSANITY
4295-39940-0012 WHICH LIES ESSENTIALLY OUTSIDE OF THE DOMAIN OF PSYCHOTHERAPY THE HELPFUL INFLUENCE WHICH PSYCHICAL FACTORS CAN EXERT
4295-39940-0013 THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS IN THE NARROWER SENSE OF THE WORD ARE IN THE PRESENT STATE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE INEFFECTIVE IN THE INSANE ASYLUM
4295-39940-0014 I SHOULD ALSO BE UNABLE TO SPEAK OF LABORATORY EXPERIENCE WITH INSANITY AS I INSIST ON SANITARIUM TREATMENT IN EVERY SUCH CASE
4295-39940-0015 THE QUESTION OF HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE THE DIAGNOSIS OF INSANITY FROM THAT OF THE OTHER MENTAL ABNORMITIES IS NOT OUR QUESTION AT THIS MOMENT
4295-39940-0016 I SELECT THE FEW ILLUSTRATIONS WHICH SEEM TO ME DESIRABLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING MORE CONCRETE OUR ABSTRACT DISCUSSION OF METHODS ESSENTIALLY FROM THE CLASS OF NEURASTHENICS
4295-39940-0017 PSYCHASTHENICS HYSTERICS AND SO ON IN ALL THESE REPORTS I SHALL CONFINE THE ACCOUNT TO THE FEW POINTS WHICH ARE TO ILLUSTRATE THE PSYCHICAL FACTORS THUS ABSTAINING ENTIRELY FROM THE FURTHER DETAILS
4295-39940-0018 WHICH ANY MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE CASES WOULD DEMAND AND FROM ALL RESULTS OF FURTHER EXAMINATION AND OTHER PARTICULARS AS A MATTER OF COURSE I EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF IDENTIFYING THE PATIENT
4295-39940-0019 I MAY START WITH A TYPICAL CASE OF OBSESSING IDEAS OF SIMPLEST CHARACTER AND WITH SIMPLE ROUTINE TREATMENT
4295-39940-0020 A MAN OF MATURE AGE WELL EDUCATED WELL BUILT AND IN EVERY RESPECT IN GOOD HEALTH WITHOUT NERVOUS HISTORY AND WITHOUT OTHER NERVOUS SYMPTOMS
4295-39940-0021 PLAYED HARDLY ANY ROLE IN THE CASE BUT HE HAD MET HER AT A GAY DINNER A SHORT TIME BEFORE HER DEATH THE NEWS OF THE SUICIDE CAME TO HIM WHEN HE WAS OVERTIRED FROM WORK
4295-39940-0022 THE IDEA OF THE CONTRAST BETWEEN SEEING HIS FRIEND PARTAKING OF THE DINNER AND IMAGINING HER DRINKING THE POISON GAVE HIM A STRONG SHOCK THERE WAS HARDLY ANY GRIEF MIXED IN
4295-39940-0023 AND IN THAT MOMENT THE VISUAL IMAGE OF THE WOMAN RAISING A GLASS OF POISON TO HER MOUTH FLASHED INTO HIS MIND AND THUS BECAME ALMOST A PART OF THE SHOCK FROM THAT TIME ON
4295-39940-0024 MORE AND MORE ANY ELEMENT OF A MEAL AND OF SOCIAL LIFE
4295-39940-0025 THE WORD GOWN OR DANCE BROUGHT UP AT ONCE THE PICTURE OF THE WOMAN WHICH HAD IN THE MEANTIME LOST EVERY ELEMENT OF PERSONAL RELATION ANY SAD THOUGHT OF HER ENDING HAD FADED AWAY
4295-39940-0026 AND ESPECIALLY THE MEALS THEMSELVES FORCED THE VISUAL IMAGE INTO THE CENTRE AND CAPTURED THE ATTENTION TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT A CONFUSING DISTRACTION FROM THE REAL SURROUNDINGS RESULTED
4295-39940-0027 THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE IDEA BECAME MORE AND MORE EXASPERATING MADE LIFE A TORTURE ALMOST SUGGESTED DESPAIR EVEN FAINT THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE AND ESPECIALLY A GROWING FEAR THAT IT WAS A SYMPTOM OF THE BEGINNING OF INSANITY
4295-39940-0028 WHEN HE CAME TO ME A NUMBER OF PHYSICAL CURES ESPECIALLY BROMIDES AND ELECTRICITY HAD BEEN TRIED IN VAIN BY THE PHYSICIAN SOME WEEKS IN THE COUNTRY HAD NOT CHANGED THE DISTRESS
4295-39940-0029 HE CAME TO ME WITH THE DIRECT REQUEST AS A LAST RESORT TO TRY HYPNOTIC TREATMENT I FOUND IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT HE AND HIS PHYSICIAN HAD CONSTANTLY SPOKEN OF VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS
4295-39940-0030 THAT THE VISUAL IMAGE HAD NO HALLUCINATORY CHARACTER AT ALL THAT IS HE NEVER BELIEVED THAT HE SAW THE IMAGE OF THAT WOMAN AS IF IT WERE ACTUALLY PRESENT HE NEVER TOOK THE PRODUCT OF HIS IMAGINATION FOR REALITY NOR HAD
4295-39940-0031 I FOUND THAT HE WAS A STRONG VISUALIZER AND EASILY SUGGESTIBLE
4295-39940-0032 THAT HE WOULD REMEMBER EVERYTHING WHICH I TOLD HIM THEN I ASKED HIM TO LIE DOWN AND HAD HIM GAZE ON A CRYSTAL ONLY FOR HALF A MINUTE THEN CLOSE THE EYES I ASKED HIM TO RELAX AND TO THINK OF SLEEP
4295-39940-0033 WITH THE TWO BLUNT POINTS OF A COMPASS I TOUCHED HIS TWO CHEEKS AT CORRESPONDING PLACES THEN HIS FOREHEAD AND NOW I TOLD HIM THAT I WOULD BEGIN WITH THE HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE
4295-39940-0034 I PUT MY HAND ON HIS FOREHEAD AND SPOKE TO HIM IN A MONOTONOUS WAY SAYING THAT HE FELT A FATIGUE IN HIS SHOULDERS AND IN HIS ARMS CREEPING OVER HIS WHOLE BODY AND ASSURED HIM
4295-39940-0035 THAT HE WAS NOW FULLY HYPNOTIZED TO WHAT DEGREE HE REALLY WAS HYPNOTIZED CANNOT BE SAID AS NO EFFORT WAS MADE TO TEST IT BY ANY EXPERIMENTS
4295-39940-0036 THUS AVOIDING ANY POSSIBLE REACTION AGAINST THE FEELING OF SUBMISSION EXPRESSION AND BREATHING INDICATED A SLIGHT HYPNOID STATE THEN I REMOVED MY HAND AND SPOKE TO HIM IN A WARM AND ASSURING WAY
4295-39940-0037 I TOLD HIM THAT IN FUTURE HE WOULD GIVE HIS FULL ATTENTION TO HIS MEAL AND NOT GIVE THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION TO ANY IMAGE OF HIS FRIEND IF HE SHOULD THINK OF THE FRIEND THE MEMORY WOULD APPEAR INDIFFERENT
4295-39940-0038 THE SUCCESS WAS COMPLETE HE CAME THE NEXT DAY IN A MUCH HAPPIER FRAME OF MIND REPORTING THAT HE STILL HAD SEEN THE IMAGE OF THE WOMAN EVERY FEW MINUTES ESPECIALLY STRONGLY AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE BUT IT HAD NO LONGER TROUBLED HIM
4295-39940-0039 IT WAS MORE IN THE BACKGROUND OF CONSCIOUSNESS SOMETIMES IT APPEARED TRANSPARENT IT NO LONGER HELD HIS ATTENTION AND HE FELT FREE TO GIVE HIS FULL ATTENTION TO THE ACTUAL SURROUNDINGS
4295-39940-0040 ON THAT BASIS I HYPNOTIZED HIM THE SECOND DAY AND HE HAD HARDLY HEARD ME SAYING THAT HE OUGHT TO TRY TO SLEEP WHEN HE WAS EVIDENTLY IN A MUCH DEEPER HYPNOTIC STATE THAN THE FIRST TIME
4295-39940-0041 AGAIN I SUGGESTED ONLY THE OPPOSITE ATTITUDE THE POSITIVE TURNING TO THE SURROUNDINGS AND THE COMPLETE NEGLECT AND INDIFFERENCE FOR THE POSSIBLE MEMORY IMAGE THIS TIME THE EFFECT WAS STILL STRONGER
4295-39940-0042 AND WOULD NOT TROUBLE HIM ANY MORE IN THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS IT STILL RETURNED TWO OR THREE TIMES BUT COLORLESS AND FAINT THE FOLLOWING DAY I WAS ABLE TO ELIMINATE IT ALTOGETHER
4295-39940-0043 EVEN WHEN THE LAST TRACE OF THE INNER STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE MEMORY AND THE PERCEIVED SURROUNDINGS HAD DISAPPEARED I WENT ON WITH TWO HYPNOTIC SITTINGS
4295-39940-0044 THAT THE CURE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN REACHED SO QUICKLY POSSIBLY NOT AT ALL IF THE SECOND SUGGESTION THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE IMAGE HAD BEEN GIVEN AT THE FIRST STEP THE IMPROVEMENT WAS SECURED
4295-39940-0045 BECAUSE THE ANTAGONISTIC PROCESS ITSELF WAS USED FOR THE SUGGESTION ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT IN THIS CASE THE STRONG WILL OF THE PATIENT OR SUGGESTION IN A NORMAL STATE
4295-39940-0046 BY AN IDEA WITHOUT EMOTIONAL VALUE OR AT LEAST BY AN IDEA WHICH HAD LOST ITS EMOTIONAL CHARACTER THE IDEA CAME SOMEWHAT NEARER TO HALLUCINATION BUT HAD ITS CHIEF ELEMENTS ON TACTUAL GROUND
4295-39940-0047 THE PATIENT IS A HIGHLY EDUCATED PHYSICIAN OF MIDDLE AGE HE REPORTS THAT HE HAD BEEN NEURASTHENIC ALL HIS LIFE WITH SLIGHT EVER CHANGING SYMPTOMS
4295-39940-0048 HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN TROUBLED BY THE PERSEVERATION OF TACTUAL IMAGES WHICH HAD A STRONG FEELING TONE AND WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SEEN OR HEARD REPORTS
4295-39940-0049 FOR INSTANCE WHEN HE READ IN A NEWSPAPER THAT SOMEONE HAD HURT HIS HAND WITH A PIN OR THAT SOMEONE HAD CUT HIS FOOT ON A NAIL HE IMMEDIATELY FELT A NOT DIRECTLY PAINFUL
4295-39940-0050 BUT UNCOMFORTABLE SENSATION AT THE PARTICULAR PLACE IN THE HAND OR IN THE FOOT TOGETHER WITH A SHRINKING OF THE WHOLE BODY AND SUCH TACTUAL SENSATION USUALLY RETURNED DURING THE FOLLOWING DAYS
4295-39940-0051 IN FAINTER AND FAINTER FORM UNTIL IT FADED AWAY MOST TROUBLESOME HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE READING OF ANY TORTURE PROCESSES IN HISTORICAL BOOKS OR IN FICTION YET THERE HAD NEVER BEEN A CASE IN WHICH
4295-39940-0052 THE SENSATIONS REALLY HAD THE VIVIDNESS OF HALLUCINATIONS AND NEVER A CASE IN WHICH THE AFTER EFFECTS HAD NOT DISAPPEARED AT LEAST IN A FEW WEEKS THIS TIME THE EFFECT HAD ALREADY LASTED FOUR MONTHS
4295-39940-0053 AND IT BECAME MORE AND MORE TROUBLESOME THE PATIENT HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST FEAR OF MENTAL DISEASE AND NO ANXIETY BUT HE FELT A VERY SERIOUS DISTURBANCE BY THE INSTINCTIVE EFFORT TO GET RID OF THE INTRUSION
4295-39940-0054 THE PLACE OF THE DISTURBANCE WAS THE WRISTS THE STARTING POINT WAS A DEFINITE EXPERIENCE ON AN UNUSUALLY HOT SUMMER DAY THE PHYSICIAN HAD LISTENED FOR A LONG TIME TO THE COMPLAINTS OF A FEMALE PATIENT
4295-39940-0055 WHERE THE STORY OF HIS PATIENT AFFECTED HIM VERY STRONGLY AND MADE HIM THINK OF IT ALL THE TIME YET THERE WAS NO SENSATION ELEMENT INVOLVED A FEW HOURS LATER HE SAT IN A HOTEL AT HIS DINNER
4295-39940-0056 JUST IN FRONT OF HIM A BUTLER STARTED TO CARVE A DUCK WITH A LONG SHARP KNIFE IN THAT MOMENT HE FELT AS IF THE KNIFE PASSED THROUGH THE WRISTS OF BOTH ARMS HE FELT FOR A MOMENT ALMOST FAINT
4295-39940-0057 ARMS AND LEGS WERE CONTRACTED AND AN ALMOST PAINFUL SENSATION LINGERED IN THE SKIN AND DID NOT DISAPPEAR FOR HOURS FROM THAT DAY AT THE SIGHT OF KNIVES OR RAZORS
4295-39940-0058 ONLY WITH THE DIFFERENCE THAT IT SELDOM WAS FOUND IN BOTH ARMS USUALLY IN THE ONE OR THE OTHER THE SENSATION BECAME A STRICTLY TACTUAL ONE WITH OPTICAL OVERTONE BUT THERE WAS NO EMOTION IN IT
4295-39940-0059 THE PAIN ELEMENT HAD DISAPPEARED ALSO THE SHOCK WHICH STILL RECURRED IN THE FIRST DAYS SLOWLY DISAPPEARED THE LONGER THE SYMPTOM LASTED THE MORE THE OPTICAL FACTOR FADED AWAY
4295-39940-0060 AND THE TACTUAL FACTOR CAME INTO THE FOREGROUND AFTER THREE OR FOUR WEEKS PERHAPS SEEING A RAZOR IN A STORE WINDOW OR A POCKET KNIFE OPEN NO LONGER STIRRED UP THE IMAGE OF CUTTING THE WRIST
4295-39940-0061 BUT SIMPLY A STRONG TACTUAL SENSATION AS IF THE SKIN OF THE WRIST WAS SCRATCHED AND PINCHED FINALLY AFTER ABOUT TWO MONTHS THE ASSOCIATION CHARACTER
4295-39940-0062 AND THE SCRATCHING AND CUTTING SENSATION IN THE SKIN BECAME INDEPENDENT AND AUTOMATIC THE PATIENT AWOKE IN THE MORNING WITH A VIVID TACTUAL HALLUCINATION OF BEING CUT WITHOUT ASSOCIATING WITH IT ANY PICTURE OF A KNIFE
4295-39940-0063 IN THE MIDST OF WORK AND IN THE MIDST OF CONVERSATION SOMETIMES ONE AND SOMETIMES THE OTHER WRIST BECAME THE CENTER OF THE EXASPERATING SENSATION EASILY BRINGING WITH IT INVOLUNTARY REACTIONS
4295-39940-0064 AS IF TO WITHDRAW THE ARM THIS BECAME MORE AND MORE FREQUENT AND MORE AND MORE VIVID
4295-39940-0065 THE DOCTOR FULLY AWARE OF THE BORDERLAND CHARACTER OF THIS EXPERIENCE FELT SURE THAT HIS INNER FIGHT AGAINST THE DISTURBANCE WOULD GET CONTROL OF IT THE USUAL TONICS DID NOT SHOW ANY INFLUENCE ON THE OTHER HAND
4295-39940-0066 THERE WERE NO OTHER NERVOUS SYMPTOMS AND WITH HIS MOST ACUTE ANALYSIS HE DID NOT FIND THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF EMOTION ANY LONGER WHEN THE SYMPTOMS REACHED A POINT AT WHICH
4295-39940-0067 THEY SERIOUSLY INTERFERED WITH HIS COMFORT HE ASKED ME FOR PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENT UNDER THE CONDITION
4295-39940-0068 THAT I WAS NOT TO APPLY HYPNOTISM HE WAS ABSOLUTELY AVERSE TO THE USE OF HYPNOTISM IN HIS OWN CASE BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID THAT TO BE HYPNOTIZED WOULD MEAN FOR HIM A CERTAIN DISPOSITION TO FALL INTO HYPNOTIC SLEEP
4295-39940-0069 IN ANY CASE HE HAD AN AVERSION TO IT AND ASKED FOR OTHER MEANS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT SEEMED TO ME THE MOST LOGICAL CONCLUSION THAT THE COUNTER IDEA WITH ITS ANTAGONISTIC REACTIONS
4295-39940-0070 MIGHT BE REENFORCED BY DIRECT PERCEPTION THE ABNORMAL TACTUAL SENSATION FORCED ON CONSCIOUSNESS THE IDEA
4295-39940-0071 THE NECESSARY COUNTER ACTION WOULD BE TO FORCE TO CONSCIOUSNESS THE IDEA OF THE UNINJURED WRIST AND THE CORRESPONDING REACTIONS AS THE WRIST CAN BE EASILY MADE ACCESSIBLE TO SIGHT
4295-39940-0072 AND AS I ANTICIPATED THAT THE VISUAL SENSATIONS WOULD BE MORE FORCEFUL THAN THE TACTUAL ONES I TOLD HIM TO LOOK STRAIGHT AT HIS OWN WRISTS FOR TEN MINUTES THREE TIMES A DAY AFTER WAKING
4295-39940-0073 AFTER LUNCHEON AND BEFORE GOING TO BED HE HAD TO HOLD HIS TWO FOREARMS CLOSE IN FRONT OF HIS EYES AND STARE AT THEM GIVING HIS FULL ATTENTION
4295-39940-0074 UNTIL THE PERCEPTION HAD CROWDED OUT THE RIVAL TOUCH SENSATION WHEN THIS PERFORMANCE HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT SIX TIMES HE DID NOT NOTICE THE COMING UP OF THE TACTUAL SENSATION
4295-39940-0075 WITH VIVIDNESS ANY LONGER FROM THE THIRD DAY IT HAD DISAPPEARED ENTIRELY I TOLD HIM TO GO ON WITH THE PROCESS STILL EVERY MORNING FOR SOME WEEKS
4295-39940-0076 THE PHYSICIAN HIMSELF CONSIDERED THE CURE AS COMPLETE OUR FIRST CASE DEALT WITH HYPNOSIS OUR SECOND CASE REMOVED THE INTRUDING IDEA BY A PERCEPTION IN A WAKING STATE
4295-39940-0077 TO POINT AT ONCE TO THE VARIETY OF METHODS WHICH WE SKETCHED WE MAY TURN AGAIN TO A CASE OF EMOTIONLESS IDEA REMOVED BY THE METHOD OF SWITCHING OFF AND SIDE TRACKING THE ORIGINATING AND
4295-39940-0078 SHE HAS HAD THIS IDEA AS LONG AS SHE CAN REMEMBER ACCORDING TO HER FIRST EXPRESSION SHE NEVER HAD ANY INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH ANY MAN SHE WAS NEVER ENGAGED
4295-39940-0079 SHE HATED BITTERLY EVERY THOUGHT OF IMMORALITY SHE KNOWS AND HAS ASSURED HERSELF BY MUCH READING THAT IT IS ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHE MIGHT GET A CHILD WITHOUT SEXUAL CONTACT
4295-39940-0080 YET THIS THOUGHT RECURS TO HER ALL THE TIME EVEN WHEN SHE IS TALKING WITH OTHER PEOPLE IT EMBARRASSES HER IN SCHOOL IN SPITE OF HER TEACHING ONLY GIRLS IN A PRIVATE INSTITUTION
4295-39940-0081 THIS THOUGHT KEEPS HER AWAY FROM COMPANY AND THE EFFECT OF ITS EMBARRASSING OCCURRENCE DEPRESSES HER BUT SHE IS SURE THAT THE THOUGHT ITSELF DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY EMOTION IT IS A MERE THINKING OF IT
4295-39940-0082 WITH A FULL CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IT IS ABSURD AND YET SHE CANNOT SUPPRESS IT I BEGAN AT ONCE TO TRY TO FIND THE ORIGIN OF HER QUEER OBSESSION AFTER SOME EFFORTS TO PIERCE INTO HER MEMORIES
4295-39940-0083 WE CAME TO AN EXPERIENCE OF HER YOUTH WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE A YOUNG GIRL WHOM SHE HAD ADMIRED MUCH FOR HER BEAUTY LIVING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF HER PARENTS SUDDENLY GOT A CHILD
4295-39940-0084 WHICH DIED AFTER A FEW DAYS AT THAT TIME NO THOUGHT OF IMMORALITY SEEMS TO HAVE ENTERED INTO THAT NEWS IT WAS EVIDENTLY MERE SADNESS ABOUT THE QUICK DEATH OF THE CHILD
4295-39940-0085 WHICH GAVE TO THE EXPERIENCE ITS EMOTIONAL TONE SHE WAS AT THAT TIME COMPLETELY NAIVE SHE RECEIVED AN INTENSE SHOCK IN THE THOUGHT THAT AN UNMARRIED GIRL MAY SUDDENLY GET A CHILD
4295-39940-0086 WHICH WOULD THEN QUICKLY DIE SHE CANNOT TELL WHETHER THE THOUGHT THAT SHE HERSELF WOULD GET A CHILD HAD EVER ENTERED HER MIND BEFORE THIS OCCURRENCE IN HER NEIGHBORHOOD NOR CAN SHE SAY
4295-39940-0087 I CONSIDERED IT A JUSTIFIABLE HYPOTHESIS THAT THIS STRONG EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE EARLY IN LIFE HAD BECOME THE STARTING POINT FOR THAT SECONDARY ABSURD THOUGHT
4295-39940-0088 FOR A DEEP PHYSIOLOGICAL BRAIN EXCITEMENT WHICH HAD IRRADIATED TOWARDS THE IDEAS OF HER PERSONALITY IT HAD STIRRED UP THERE ASSOCIATIONS WHICH KEPT THEIR PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTER
4295-39940-0089 WHILE THE PRIMARY DISTURBANCE HAD LONG LOST ITS PSYCHICAL ACCOMPANIMENT IT WORKED ITS MISCHIEF IN A PHYSIOLOGICAL SPHERE BUT WAS PROBABLY STILL THE STARTING POINT FOR THE PERSISTENT OBSESSION
4295-39940-0090 MY AIM WAS TO REMOVE THIS CAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BROUGHT LITTLE IMPROVEMENT SIMPLY TO SUPPRESS THE FREAK IDEA AS LONG AS THAT PHYSIOLOGICAL SOURCE WAS ACTIVE ON THE OTHER HAND
4295-39940-0091 I SHOULD NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO STOP THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AFTER EFFECTS OF THAT REAL EXPERIENCE I HAD TO SIDETRACK IT AND TO SECURE THUS A REDUCTION I DECIDED THEREFORE
4295-39940-0092 TO WORK ON THE BASIS OF THAT HYPOTHESIS TO ACCEPT THAT PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLEX AS EXISTING BUT TO SWITCH IT OFF BY LINKING IT WITH APPROPRIATE ASSOCIATIONS
4295-39940-0093 FOR THAT PURPOSE I BROUGHT HER INTO A HYPNOID STATE BENDING HER HEAD BACKWARDS AND SPEAKING TO HER WITH SLOW VOICE UNTIL I SAW THAT A SLIGHT DROWSY STATE WAS REACHED
4295-39940-0094 SHE IS TO IMAGINE THAT SHE SPEAKS WITH HER NOW I MAKE HER TALK WITH ME
4295-39940-0095 I ASK HER TO TELL THE GIRL HOW INDIGNANT SHE FEELS OVER HER BEHAVIOR SHE IS TO TELL HER THAT SHE UNDERSTANDS NOW ALL WHICH SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND IN HER CHILDHOOD THAT SHE KNOWS NOW
4295-39940-0096 THAT SHE MUST HAVE LIVED AN IMMORAL LIFE THAT SHE MUST HAVE HAD A FRIEND AND THAT A PURE GIRL LIKE HERSELF COULD NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES COME INTO SUCH A SITUATION
4295-39940-0097 THAT NO PURE GIRL COULD SUDDENLY HAVE A CHILD SHE IS TO EXPRESS TO THE OTHER GIRL HER DEEPEST DISAPPROVAL OF SUCH CONDUCT AND HER OWN FEELING OF HAPPINESS
4295-39940-0098 SHE INTERNALLY SPOKE WITH GREAT VIVIDNESS TO HER NEIGHBOR WHEN I AWOKE HER FROM HER DROWSY STATE SHE WAS QUITE EXHAUSTED FROM THE EXCITEMENT I REPEATED THAT SCENE WITH HER FOUR TIMES
4295-39940-0099 SHE ASSURED ME THAT SHE FELT IT EVERY TIME MORE DRAMATICALLY THE POWER OF THE OBSESSION WEAKENED FROM THE FIRST DAY AFTER THE FOURTH TIME IT HAD DISAPPEARED
