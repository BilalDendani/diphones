1556-143307-0000 CHAPTER THIRTEEN OVER THE RIVER IT IS OUR INTENTION TO EXPLORE A ROUTE FROM KANAB TO THE COLORADO RIVER AT THE MOUTH OF THE PARIA AND IF SUCCESSFUL IN THIS UNDERTAKING TO CROSS THE RIVER AND PROCEED TO TUSAYAN
1556-143307-0001 AND ULTIMATELY TO SANTA FE NEW MEXICO WE PROPOSE TO BUILD A FLATBOAT FOR THE PURPOSE OF FERRYING OVER THE RIVER AND HAVE HAD THE LUMBER NECESSARY FOR THAT PURPOSE HAULED FROM SAINT GEORGE TO KANAB FROM HERE TO THE MOUTH OF THE PARIA
1556-143307-0002 PUSHING ON TO THE EAST WITH MISTER HAMBLIN FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS IN THE EARLY MORNING WE REACH THE MOUTH OF A DRY CANYON WHICH COMES DOWN THROUGH THE CLIFFS INSTEAD OF A NARROW CANYON WE FIND AN OPEN VALLEY
1556-143307-0003 FROM ONE FOURTH TO ONE HALF A MILE IN WIDTH ON RARE OCCASIONS A STREAM FLOWS DOWN THIS VALLEY BUT NOW SAND DUNES STRETCH ACROSS IT
1556-143307-0004 HERE AGAIN WE FIND THAT WONDERFUL SCENERY OF NAKED WHITE ROCKS CARVED INTO GREAT ROUND BOSSES AND DOMES LOOKING OFF TO THE NORTH WE CAN SEE VERMILION AND PINK CLIFFS CROWNED WITH FORESTS
1556-143307-0005 WHILE BELOW US TO THE SOUTH STRETCH THE DUNES AND RED LANDS OF THE VERMILION CLIFF REGION AND FAR AWAY WE CAN SEE THE OPPOSITE WALL OF THE GRAND CANYON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON WE DESCEND INTO THE CANYON VALLEY AND HURRIEDLY RIDE
1556-143307-0006 AND BY DIGGING INTO THE SAND THIS SWEET WATER IS FOUND
1556-143307-0007 AT SUNRISE MISTER HAMBLIN AND I PART FROM THE TRAIN ONCE MORE TAKING WITH US CHUAR
1556-143307-0008 ALL DAY LONG OUR WAY IS OVER RED HILLS WITH A BOLD LINE OF CLIFFS ON OUR LEFT A LITTLE AFTER NOON WE REACH A GREAT SPRING AND HERE WE ARE TO CAMP FOR THE NIGHT FOR THE REGION BEYOND US IS UNKNOWN AND WE WISH TO ENTER IT WITH A GOOD DAY BEFORE US
1556-143307-0009 AND HAMBLIN AND I CLIMB THE CLIFFS
1556-143307-0010 EARLY IN THE MORNING WE PASS UP A BEAUTIFUL VALLEY TO THE SOUTH AND TURN WESTWARD ONTO A GREAT PROMONTORY FROM THE SUMMIT OF WHICH THE GRAND CANYON IS IN VIEW ITS DEEP GORGE CAN BE SEEN TO THE WESTWARD FOR FIFTY OR SIXTY MILES
1556-143307-0011 AND TO THE SOUTHEASTWARD WE LOOK OFF INTO THE STUPENDOUS CHASM WITH ITS MARVELOUS FORMS AND COLORS TWENTY ONE YEARS LATER I READ OVER THE NOTES OF THAT DAY'S EXPERIENCE AND THE PICTURE OF THE GRAND CANYON FROM THIS POINT IS ONCE MORE BEFORE ME
1556-143307-0012 I DID NOT KNOW WHEN WRITING THE NOTES THAT THIS WAS THE GRANDEST VIEW THAT CAN BE OBTAINED OF THE REGION FROM FREMONT'S PEAK TO THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA BUT I DID REALIZE THAT THE SCENE BEFORE ME WAS AWFUL SUBLIME AND GLORIOUS
1556-143307-0013 AWFUL IN PROFOUND DEPTHS SUBLIME IN MASSIVE AND STRANGE FORMS AND GLORIOUS IN COLORS YEARS LATER I VISITED THE SAME SPOT WITH MY FRIEND THOMAS MORAN FROM THIS WORLD OF WONDER HE SELECTED A SECTION WHICH WAS THE MOST INTERESTING TO HIM
1556-143307-0014 AND PAINTED IT THAT PAINTING KNOWN AS THE CHASM OF THE COLORADO IS IN A HALL IN THE SENATE WING OF THE CAPITOL OF THE UNITED STATES IF ANY ONE WILL LOOK UPON THAT PICTURE AND THEN REALIZE THAT IT WAS BUT A SMALL PART OF THE LANDSCAPE
1556-143307-0015 BEFORE US ON THIS MEMORABLE TWENTY SIXTH DAY OF SEPTEMBER HE WILL UNDERSTAND WHY I SUPPRESS MY NOTES DESCRIPTIVE OF THE SCENE THE LANDSCAPE IS TOO VAST TOO COMPLEX TOO GRAND FOR VERBAL DESCRIPTION
1556-143307-0016 WHO HAVE JOINED US HERE BY PREVIOUS APPOINTMENT AS WE NEED THEIR SERVICES IN CROSSING THE RIVER ON THE LAST DAY OF SEPTEMBER WE FOLLOW THE VERMILION CLIFFS AROUND TO THE MOUTH OF THE PARIA HERE THE CLIFFS PRESENT A WALL OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET IN HEIGHT
1556-143307-0017 ABOVE ORANGE AND VERMILION BUT BELOW CHOCOLATE PURPLE AND GRAY IN ALTERNATING BANDS OF RAINBOW BRIGHTNESS THE CLIFFS ARE CUT WITH DEEP SIDE CANYONS AND THE RAINBOW HILLS BELOW ARE DESTITUTE OF VEGETATION
1556-143307-0018 OR CUTS ITS BOTTOM DEEPER AND STILL DEEPER EVER FORMING NARROW CLEFTS BUT WHEN THE STREAM HAS CUT ITS CHANNEL DOWN UNTIL THE DECLIVITY IS GREATLY REDUCED IT CAN NO LONGER CARRY THE LOAD OF SAND WITH WHICH IT IS FED BUT DROPS A PART OF IT ON THE WAY
1556-143307-0019 WHEREVER IT DROPS IT IN THIS MANNER A SAND BANK IS FORMED NOW THE EFFECT OF THIS SAND BAR IS TO TURN THE COURSE OF THE RIVER AGAINST THE WALL OR BANK AND AS IT UNLOADS IN ONE PLACE IT CUTS IN ANOTHER BELOW AND LOADS ITSELF AGAIN
1556-143307-0020 SO LONG AS THE DECLIVITY OF THE STREAM IS GREAT THE GREATER THE LOAD OF SAND CARRIED THE GREATER THE RATE OF VERTICAL CUTTING BUT WHEN THE DECLIVITY IS REDUCED SO THAT PART OF THE LOAD IS THROWN DOWN VERTICAL CUTTING IS CHANGED TO LATERAL
1556-143307-0021 AND THE DAY IS SPENT IN GETTING TO ITS SUMMIT WE MAKE A DRY CAMP THAT IS WITHOUT WATER EXCEPT THAT WHICH HAS BEEN CARRIED IN CANTEENS BY THE INDIANS OCTOBER FOURTH
1556-143307-0022 ALL DAY LONG WE PASS BY THE FOOT OF THE ECHO CLIFFS WHICH ARE IN FACT THE CONTINUATION OF THE VERMILION CLIFFS
1556-143307-0023 AND DEEP CHASMS RUNNING DOWN INTO THE MARBLE CANYON ON THE RIGHT AT NIGHT WE CAMP AT A WATER POCKET A POOL IN A GREAT LIMESTONE ROCK WE STILL GO SOUTH FOR ANOTHER HALF DAY TO A CEDAR RIDGE HERE WE TURN WESTWARD CLIMBING THE CLIFFS
1556-143307-0024 A GREAT HOMOGENEOUS SANDSTONE STRETCHES DECLINING RAPIDLY AND ON ITS SIDES ARE CARVED INNUMERABLE BASINS WHICH ARE NOW FILLED WITH PURE WATER AND WE CALL THIS THE THOUSAND WELLS
1556-143307-0025 WE HAVE A LONG AFTERNOON'S RIDE OVER SAND DUNES SLOWLY TOILING FROM MILE TO MILE WE CAN SEE A LEDGE OF ROCKS IN THE DISTANCE AND THE INDIAN WITH US ASSURES US THAT WE SHALL FIND WATER THERE
1556-143307-0026 AT NIGHT WE COME TO THE CLIFF AND UNDER IT IN A GREAT CAVE WE FIND A LAKELET SWEETER COOLER WATER NEVER BLESSED THE DESERT WHILE AT JACOB'S POOL SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE I SENT A RUNNER FORWARD INTO THIS REGION WITH INSTRUCTIONS
1556-143307-0027 TO HUNT US UP SOME OF THE NATIVES AND BRING THEM TO THIS POOL WHEN WE ARRIVE WE ARE DISAPPOINTED IN NOT FINDING THEM ON HAND BUT A LITTLE LATER HALF A DOZEN MEN COME IN WITH THE INDIAN MESSENGER THEY ARE SURLY FELLOWS AND SEEM TO BE DISPLEASED AT OUR COMING
1556-143307-0028 ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK I SET A COUPLE OF MEN TO PREPARE A HASTY LUNCH CALL UP ALL HANDS AND WE SADDLE PACK EAT OUR LUNCH AND START OFF TO THE SOUTHWEST TO REACH THE MOENKOPI WHERE THERE IS A LITTLE RANCHERIA OF INDIANS
1556-143307-0029 SO WE ARE TOLD WE SET OUT AT A RAPID RATE AND WHEN DAYLIGHT COMES WE ARE IN SIGHT OF THE CANYON OF THE MOENKOPI INTO WHICH WE SOON DESCEND BUT THE RANCHERIA HAS BEEN ABANDONED
1556-143307-0030 THOUGH I HAVE SEEN MANY RUINS FROM TIME TO TIME AT FIRST I AM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THE PEOPLE THEY SEEM SCARCELY SUPERIOR TO THE SHOSHONES AND UTES TRIBES WITH WHOM I AM SO WELL ACQUAINTED THEIR DRESS IS LESS PICTURESQUE
1556-143307-0031 AND THE MEN HAVE AN UGLY FASHION OF BANGING THEIR HAIR IN FRONT SO THAT IT COMES DOWN TO THEIR EYES AND CONCEALS THEIR FOREHEADS BUT THE WOMEN ARE MORE NEATLY DRESSED AND ARRANGE THEIR HAIR IN PICTURESQUE COILS ORAIBI IS A TOWN OF SEVERAL HUNDRED INHABITANTS
1556-143307-0032 IT STANDS ON A MESA OR LITTLE PLATEAU TWO HUNDRED OR THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SURROUNDING PLAIN THE MESA ITSELF HAS A RATHER DIVERSIFIED SURFACE THE STREETS OF THE TOWN ARE QUITE IRREGULAR AND IN A GENERAL WAY RUN FROM NORTH TO SOUTH
1556-143307-0033 THE HOUSES ARE CONSTRUCTED TO FACE THE EAST THEY ARE OF STONE LAID IN MORTAR AND ARE USUALLY THREE OR FOUR STORIES HIGH THE SECOND STORY STANDS BACK UPON THE FIRST LEAVING A TERRACE OVER ONE TIER OF ROOMS
1556-143307-0034 THIRD IS SET BACK OF THE SECOND AND THE FOURTH BACK OF THE THIRD SO THAT THEIR HOUSES ARE TERRACED TO FACE THE EAST THESE TERRACES ON THE TOP ARE ALL FLAT AND THE PEOPLE USUALLY ASCEND TO THE FIRST TERRACE BY A LADDER
1556-143307-0035 AND THEN BY ANOTHER INTO THE LOWER ROOMS IN LIKE MANNER LADDERS OR RUDE STAIRWAYS ARE USED TO REACH THE UPPER STORIES THE CLIMATE IS VERY WARM AND THE PEOPLE LIVE ON THE TOPS OF THEIR HOUSES
1556-143307-0036 IT SEEMS STRANGE TO SEE LITTLE NAKED CHILDREN CLIMBING THE LADDERS AND RUNNING OVER THE HOUSE TOPS LIKE HERDS OF MONKEYS AFTER WE HAVE LOOKED ABOUT THE TOWN AND BEEN GAZED UPON BY THE WONDERING EYES OF THE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN
1556-143307-0037 IN A LARGE CENTRAL ROOM WE GATHER AND THE FOOD IS PLACED BEFORE US A STEW OF GOAT'S FLESH IS SERVED IN EARTHEN BOWLS AND EACH ONE OF US IS FURNISHED WITH A LITTLE EARTHEN LADLE THE BREAD IS A GREAT NOVELTY TO ME
1556-143307-0038 IT IS MADE OF CORN MEAL IN SHEETS AS THIN AND LARGE AS FOOLSCAP PAPER IN THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE IS A LITTLE OVEN THE TOP OF WHICH IS A GREAT FLAT STONE AND THE GOOD HOUSEWIFE BAKES HER BREAD IN THIS MANNER
1556-143307-0039 WITH A THIN COATING OF THE MEAL PASTE IN A MINUTE OR TWO IT FORMS INTO A THIN PAPER LIKE CAKE AND SHE TAKES IT UP BY THE EDGE FOLDS IT ONCE AND PLACES IT ON A BASKET TRAY
1556-143307-0040 THEN ANOTHER AND ANOTHER SHEET OF PAPER BREAD IS MADE IN LIKE MANNER AND PILED ON THE TRAY I NOTICE THAT THE PASTE STANDS IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BOWLS AND THAT SHE TAKES FROM ONE BOWL AND THEN ANOTHER IN ORDER
1556-143307-0041 AND I SOON SEE THE EFFECT OF THIS THE CORN BEFORE BEING GROUND IS ASSORTED BY COLORS WHITE YELLOW RED BLUE AND BLACK AND THE SHEETS OF BREAD WHEN MADE ARE OF THE SAME VARIETY OF COLORS WHITE YELLOW RED BLUE AND BLACK
1556-143307-0042 THIS BREAD HELD ON VERY BEAUTIFUL TRAYS IS ITSELF A WORK OF ART THEY CALL IT PIKI AFTER WE HAVE PARTAKEN OF GOAT STEW AND BREAD A COURSE OF DUMPLINGS MELONS AND PEACHES IS SERVED
1556-143307-0043 AND THIS FINISHES THE FEAST WHAT SEEM TO BE DUMPLINGS ARE COMPOSED OF A KIND OF HASH OF BREAD AND MEAT TIED UP IN LITTLE BALLS WITH CORNHUSKS AND SERVED BOILING HOT THEY ARE EATEN WITH MUCH GUSTO BY THE PARTY AND HIGHLY PRAISED
1556-143307-0044 SOME DAYS AFTER WE LEARNED HOW THEY ARE MADE THEY ARE PREPARED OF GOAT'S FLESH BREAD AND TURNIPS AND KNEADED BY MASTICATION AS WE PREFER TO MASTICATE OUR OWN FOOD THIS DAINTY DISH IS NEVER AGAIN A FAVORITE
1556-143307-0045 ONCE MORE THEY SPRINKLE THE SACRED WATER AND THE SACRED MEAL OVER THE TOPS OF THE HOUSES THEN THE CACIQUE IN A LOUD VOICE DIRECTS THE LABOR OF THE DAY SO HIS TALK IS EXPLAINED TO US SOME MUST GATHER CORN OTHERS MUST GO FOR WOOD
1556-143307-0046 WATER MUST BE BROUGHT FROM THE DISTANT WELLS AND THE ANIMALS OF THE STRANGERS MUST BE CARED FOR NOW THE HOUSE TOPS PRESENT A LIVELY SCENE BOWLS OF WATER ARE BROUGHT
1556-143307-0047 FROM THEM THE MEN FILL THEIR MOUTHS AND WITH DEXTERITY BLOW WATER OVER THEIR HANDS IN SPRAY AND WASH THEIR FACES AND LAVE THEIR LONG SHINING HEADS OF HAIR AND THE WOMEN DRESS ONE ANOTHER'S LOCKS WITH BOWLS OF WATER THEY MAKE SUDS OF THE YUCCA PLANT
1556-143307-0048 AND WASH AND COMB AND DEFTLY ROLL THEIR HAIR THE ELDER WOMEN IN GREAT COILS AT THE BACK OF THE HEAD THE YOUNGER WOMEN IN FLAT COILS ON THEIR CHEEKS AND SO THE DAYS ARE PASSED AND THE WEEKS GO BY
1556-143307-0049 AND WE STUDY THE LANGUAGE OF THE PEOPLE AND RECORD MANY HUNDREDS OF THEIR WORDS AND OBSERVE THEIR HABITS AND CUSTOMS AND GAIN SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR MYTHOLOGY BUT ABOVE ALL DO WE BECOME INTERESTED IN THEIR RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES
1556-143307-0050 THE LEADER OF THE SHAMANS IS A GREAT BURLY BALD HEADED INDIAN WHICH IS A REMARKABLE SIGHT FOR I HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE WHATEVER HE SAYS OR DOES IS REPEATED BY THREE OTHERS IN TURN THE PARAPHERNALIA
1556-143307-0051 OF THEIR WORSHIP IS VERY INTERESTING AT ONE END OF THE CHAMBER IS A SERIES OF TABLETS OF WOOD COVERED WITH QUAINT PICTURES OF ANIMALS AND OF CORN AND OVERHEAD ARE CONVENTIONAL BLACK CLOUDS FROM WHICH YELLOW LIGHTNINGS ARE PROJECTED
1556-143307-0052 WHILE DROPS OF RAIN FALL ON THE CORN BELOW WOODEN BIRDS SET ON PEDESTALS AND DECORATED WITH PLUMES ARE ARRANGED IN VARIOUS WAYS EARS OF CORN VASES OF HOLY WATER
1556-143307-0053 AND TRAYS OF MEAL MAKE UP A PART OF THE PARAPHERNALIA OF WORSHIP I TRY TO RECORD SOME OF THE PRAYERS BUT AM NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO HOLD MY INTERPRETER TO THE WORK BUT ONE OF THESE PRAYERS IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
1556-143307-0054 PASH LOLOMAI MASTER OF THE CLOUDS WE EAT NO STOLEN BREAD OUR YOUNG MEN RIDE NOT THE STOLEN ASS OUR FOOD IS NOT STOLEN FROM THE GARDENS OF OUR NEIGHBORS
1556-143307-0055 WE BESEECH OF THEE TO DIP YOUR GREAT SPRINKLER MADE OF THE FEATHERS OF THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS INTO THE LAKES OF THE SKIES AND SPRINKLE US WITH SWEET RAINS THAT THE GROUND MAY BE PREPARED IN THE WINTER FOR THE CORN THAT GROWS IN THE SUMMER
1556-143307-0056 AT ONE TIME IN THE NIGHT THREE WOMEN WERE BROUGHT INTO THE KIVA THESE WOMEN HAD A CINCTURE OF COTTON ABOUT THEIR LOINS BUT WERE OTHERWISE NUDE ONE WAS VERY OLD ANOTHER OF MIDDLE AGE AND THE THIRD QUITE YOUNG
1556-143307-0057 NECKS SHOULDERS AND BREASTS OF THE WOMEN THEN WITH HIS FINGER AS A BRUSH HE DECORATED THEM OVER THIS GROUNDWORK WHICH WAS OF YELLOW WITH MANY FIGURES IN VARIOUS COLORS FROM THAT TIME TO DAYLIGHT THE THREE WOMEN REMAINED IN THE KIVA
1556-143307-0058 AND TOOK PART IN THE CEREMONY AS CHORISTERS AND DANCING PERFORMERS AT SUNRISE WE ARE FILED OUT OF THE KIVA AND A CURIOUS SIGHT IS PRESENTED TO OUR VIEW SHUPAULOVI IS BUILT IN TERRACES ABOUT A CENTRAL COURT OR PLAZA
1556-143307-0059 AND IN THE PLAZA ABOUT FIFTY MEN ARE DRAWN UP IN A LINE FACING US THESE MEN ARE NAKED EXCEPT THAT THEY WEAR MASKS STRANGE AND GROTESQUE AND GREAT FLARING HEADDRESSES IN MANY COLORS OUR PARTY FROM THE KIVA STAND BEFORE THIS LINE OF MEN
1556-143307-0060 WITH A GREAT CHORUS OF SINGERS SET UP A TUMULTUOUS NOISE AND WITH SLOW SHUFFLING STEPS THE LINE OF MEN AND THE LINE OF WOMEN MOVE TOWARD EACH OTHER IN A CURIOUS WAVING DANCE
1556-143307-0061 WHEN THE LINES APPROACH SO AS TO BE NOT MORE THAN TEN OR TWELVE FEET APART OUR PARTY STILL BEING BETWEEN THEM THEY ALL CHANGE SO AS TO DANCE BACKWARD TO THEIR ORIGINAL POSITIONS
1556-143307-0062 THIS IS REPEATED UNTIL THE DANCERS HAVE PASSED OVER THE PLAZA FOUR TIMES THEN THERE IS A WILD CONFUSION OF DANCES THE ORDER OF WHICH I CANNOT UNDERSTAND IF INDEED THERE IS ANY SYSTEM EXCEPT THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN DANCE APART
1556-143307-0063 SOON THIS IS OVER AND THE WOMEN ALL FILE DOWN THE LADDER INTO THE KIVA AND THE MEN STRIP OFF THEIR MASKS AND ARRANGE THEMSELVES ABOUT THE PLAZA EVERY ONE ACCORDING TO HIS OWN WISH BUT AS IF IN SHARP EXPECTANCY
1556-143307-0064 THEN THE WOMEN RETURN UP THE LADDER FROM THE KIVA AND CLIMB TO THE TOPS OF THE HOUSES AND STAND ON THE BRINK OF THE NEARER TERRACE NOW THE MUSIC COMMENCES ONCE MORE
1556-143307-0065 THROWS SOMETHING I CANNOT TELL WHAT INTO THE MIDST OF THE PLAZA WITH A SHOUT AND A SCREAM EVERY MAN JUMPS FOR IT ONE SEIZES IT ANOTHER TAKES IT AWAY FROM HIM AND THEN ANOTHER SECURES IT
1556-143307-0066 WE EMPLOY OUR TIME IN MAKING A COLLECTION OF THE ARTS OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS TOWN FIRST WE DISPLAY TO THEM OUR STOCK OF GOODS COMPOSED OF KNIVES NEEDLES AWLS SCISSORS PAINTS DYESTUFFS LEATHER AND VARIOUS FABRICS IN GAY COLORS
1556-143307-0067 THEN WE GO AROUND AMONG THE PEOPLE AND SELECT THE ARTICLES OF POTTERY STONE IMPLEMENTS INSTRUMENTS AND UTENSILS MADE OF BONE HORN SHELL ARTICLES OF CLOTHING AND ORNAMENT BASKETS TRAYS AND MANY OTHER THINGS
1556-143307-0068 AND TELL THE PEOPLE TO BRING THEM THE NEXT DAY TO OUR ROOMS A LITTLE AFTER SUNRISE THEY COME IN AND WE HAVE A BUSY DAY OF BARTER WHEN ARTICLES ARE BROUGHT IN SUCH AS I WANT I LAY THEM ASIDE
1556-143307-0069 AND IT RISES FROM THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SAND PLAINS BELOW BY A PRECIPITOUS CLIFF ON EVERY SIDE TO REACH IT FROM BELOW IT MUST BE CLIMBED BY NICHES AND STAIRWAYS IN THE ROCK IT IS A GOOD SITE FOR DEFENSE
1556-143307-0070 AT THE FOOT OF THE CLIFF AND ON SOME TERRACES THE PEOPLE HAVE BUILT CORRALS OF STONE FOR THEIR ASSES ALL THE WATER USED IN THESE THREE TOWNS IS DERIVED FROM A WELL NEARLY A MILE AWAY A DEEP PIT SUNK IN THE SAND OVER THE SITE OF A DUNE
1556-143307-0071 AND AFTER THEY ARE FED THEY ARE SENT AWAY TO A DISTANCE OF SOME MILES THERE IS NO TREE OR SHRUB GROWING NEAR THE WALPI MESA IT IS MILES AWAY TO WHERE THE STUNTED CEDARS ARE FOUND AND THE PEOPLE BRING CURIOUS LITTLE LOADS OF WOOD ON THE BACKS OF THEIR DONKEYS
1556-143307-0072 HANO OR TEWA AS IT IS SOMETIMES CALLED HAS BEEN BUILT LATELY
1556-143307-0073 THE OTHER TOWNS ARE VERY OLD THEIR FOUNDATION DATES BACK MANY CENTURIES SO WE GATHER FROM THIS TALK THE PEOPLE OF HANO ALSO SPEAK A RADICALLY DISTINCT LANGUAGE BELONGING TO ANOTHER STOCK OF TRIBES THEY FORMERLY LIVED ON THE RIO GRANDE
1556-143307-0074 BUT DURING SOME WAR THEY WERE DRIVEN AWAY AND WERE PERMITTED TO BUILD THEIR HOME HERE TWO DAYS ARE SPENT IN TRADING WITH THE PEOPLE AND WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON HAVING MADE A GOOD ETHNOLOGIC COLLECTION WE ARE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN SEEING THE MEN AND WOMEN SPIN AND WEAVE
1556-143307-0075 OR MEDICINE ORDERS AS THEY ARE SOMETIMES CALLED BUT THIS INSTITUTION HAS BEEN NOWHERE DEVELOPED MORE THOROUGHLY THAN AMONG THE PUEBLO INDIANS OF THIS REGION
1556-143307-0076 THAT A PART OF THEIR CEREMONIES ARE SECRET AND ANOTHER PART PUBLIC AND THAT THE TIMES OF CEREMONY ARE ALSO TIMES FOR FEASTING AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HERE AT WALPI THE GREAT SNAKE DANCE IS PERFORMED FOR SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE THIS FESTIVAL IS HELD
1556-143307-0077 THE PEOPLE WITH GREAT DILIGENCE GATHER SNAKES FROM THE ROCKS AND SANDS OF THE REGION ROUND ABOUT AND BRING THEM TO THE KIVA OF ONE OF THEIR CLANS IN GREAT NUMBERS BY SCORES AND HUNDREDS MOST OF THESE SNAKES ARE QUITE HARMLESS BUT RATTLESNAKES ABOUND
1556-143307-0078 AND THEY ARE ALSO CAUGHT FOR THEY PLAY THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE GREAT SNAKE DANCE THE MEDICINE MEN OR PRIEST DOCTORS ARE VERY DEFT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF RATTLESNAKES WHEN THEY BRING THEM TO THE KIVA
1556-143307-0079 THEY HERD ALL THE SNAKES IN A GREAT MASS OF WRITHING HISSING RATTLING SERPENTS FOR THIS PURPOSE THEY HAVE LITTLE WANDS TO THE END OF EACH ONE OF WHICH A BUNCH OF FEATHERS IS AFFIXED IF A SNAKE ATTEMPTS TO LEAVE ITS ALLOTTED PLACE IN THE KIVA
1556-143307-0080 THE MEN OF THE ORDER PREPARE FOR THE GREAT PERFORMANCE WITH THE SNAKES CLOTHED ONLY IN LOINCLOTH EACH ONE SEIZES A SNAKE AND A RATTLESNAKE IS PREFERRED IF THERE ARE ENOUGH OF THEM FOR ALL IT IS MANAGED IN THIS WAY
1556-143307-0081 THE SNAKE IS TEASED WITH THE FEATHER WAND AND HIS ATTENTION OCCUPIED BY ONE MAN WHILE ANOTHER STANDING NEAR AT A FAVORABLE MOMENT SEIZES THE SNAKE JUST BACK OF THE HEAD THEN HE PUTS THE SNAKE IN HIS MOUTH
1556-143307-0082 BUT THE ATTENTION OF THE SNAKE IS CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED BY THE ATTENDANT WHO CARRIES THE WAND THEN THE MEN OF THE PRIEST ORDER CARRYING THE SNAKES IN THEIR MOUTHS ARRANGE THEMSELVES IN A LINE IN THE COURT AND MOVE IN A PROCESSION SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT THE COURT AND THEN ENGAGE IN A DANCE
