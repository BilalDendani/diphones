2498-134786-0020 A BRIGADIER OF GENDARMES WHO SEEMED TO BE IN COMMAND OF THE GROUP WAS STANDING NEAR THE DOOR HE ENTERED AND ADVANCED TO THE BISHOP MAKING A MILITARY SALUTE MONSEIGNEUR SAID HE
2498-134786-0021 AT THIS WORD JEAN VALJEAN WHO WAS DEJECTED AND SEEMED OVERWHELMED
2498-134786-0022 WITH AN AIR OF STUPEFACTION MONSEIGNEUR HE MURMURED SO HE IS NOT THE CURE SILENCE SAID THE GENDARME HE IS MONSEIGNEUR THE BISHOP

2498-134786-0025 JEAN VALJEAN OPENED HIS EYES WIDE AND STARED AT THE VENERABLE BISHOP WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH NO HUMAN TONGUE CAN RENDER ANY ACCOUNT OF MONSEIGNEUR SAID THE BRIGADIER OF GENDARMES
