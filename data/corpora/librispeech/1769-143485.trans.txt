1769-143485-0000 AS YET I HAVE CONSIDERED MAN MERELY IN HIS PHYSICAL CAPACITY LET US NOW ENDEAVOUR TO EXAMINE HIM IN A METAPHYSICAL AND MORAL LIGHT I CAN DISCOVER NOTHING IN ANY MERE ANIMAL
1769-143485-0001 THAT NATURE ALONE OPERATES IN ALL THE OPERATIONS OF THE BEAST WHEREAS MAN AS A FREE AGENT HAS A SHARE IN HIS ONE CHOOSES BY INSTINCT
1769-143485-0002 FOR WHICH REASON THE BEAST CANNOT DEVIATE FROM THE RULES THAT HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED TO IT EVEN IN CASES WHERE SUCH DEVIATION MIGHT BE USEFUL AND MAN OFTEN DEVIATES FROM THE RULES LAID DOWN FOR HIM TO HIS PREJUDICE
1769-143485-0003 THUS A PIGEON WOULD STARVE NEAR A DISH OF THE BEST FLESH MEAT AND A CAT ON A HEAP OF FRUIT OR CORN
1769-143485-0004 DID THEY BUT BETHINK THEMSELVES TO MAKE A TRIAL OF IT IT IS IN THIS MANNER DISSOLUTE MEN RUN INTO EXCESSES WHICH BRING ON FEVERS AND DEATH ITSELF BECAUSE THE MIND DEPRAVES THE SENSES AND WHEN NATURE CEASES TO SPEAK
1769-143485-0005 THE WILL STILL CONTINUES TO DICTATE
1769-143485-0006 THAN BETWEEN SOME MEN AND SOME BEASTS IT IS NOT THEREFORE SO MUCH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CONSTITUTES AMONG ANIMALS THE SPECIFICAL DISTINCTION OF MAN AS HIS QUALITY OF A FREE AGENT NATURE SPEAKS TO ALL ANIMALS
1769-143485-0007 FOR NATURAL PHILOSOPHY EXPLAINS IN SOME MEASURE THE MECHANISM OF THE SENSES AND THE FORMATION OF IDEAS BUT IN THE POWER OF WILLING OR RATHER OF CHOOSING AND IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THIS POWER NOTHING CAN BE DISCOVERED BUT ACTS
1769-143485-0008 THAT ARE PURELY SPIRITUAL AND CANNOT BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE LAWS OF MECHANICS BUT THOUGH THE DIFFICULTIES IN WHICH ALL THESE QUESTIONS ARE INVOLVED SHOULD LEAVE SOME ROOM TO DISPUTE ON THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAN AND BEAST
1769-143485-0009 THERE IS ANOTHER VERY SPECIFIC QUALITY THAT DISTINGUISHES THEM AND A QUALITY WHICH WILL ADMIT OF NO DISPUTE THIS IS THE FACULTY OF IMPROVEMENT A FACULTY WHICH
1769-143485-0010 AS CIRCUMSTANCES OFFER SUCCESSIVELY UNFOLDS ALL THE OTHER FACULTIES AND RESIDES AMONG US NOT ONLY IN THE SPECIES BUT IN THE INDIVIDUALS THAT COMPOSE IT
1769-143485-0011 AND HIS SPECIES AT THE END OF A THOUSAND YEARS PRECISELY WHAT IT WAS THE FIRST YEAR OF THAT LONG PERIOD WHY IS MAN ALONE SUBJECT TO DOTAGE IS IT NOT BECAUSE HE THUS RETURNS TO HIS PRIMITIVE CONDITION
1769-143485-0012 CONTINUES ALWAYS IN POSSESSION OF HIS INSTINCT MAN LOSING BY OLD AGE OR BY ACCIDENT ALL THE ACQUISITIONS HE HAD MADE IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS PERFECTIBILITY
1769-143485-0013 IT WOULD BE A MELANCHOLY NECESSITY FOR US TO BE OBLIGED TO ALLOW THAT THIS DISTINCTIVE AND ALMOST UNLIMITED FACULTY IS THE SOURCE OF ALL MAN'S MISFORTUNES THAT IT IS THIS FACULTY WHICH THOUGH BY SLOW DEGREES DRAWS THEM OUT OF THEIR ORIGINAL CONDITION
1769-143485-0014 SAVAGE MAN ABANDONED BY NATURE TO PURE INSTINCT OR RATHER INDEMNIFIED FOR THAT WHICH HAS PERHAPS BEEN DENIED TO HIM BY FACULTIES CAPABLE OF IMMEDIATELY SUPPLYING THE PLACE OF IT AND OF RAISING HIM AFTERWARDS A GREAT DEAL HIGHER
1769-143485-0015 WOULD THEREFORE BEGIN WITH FUNCTIONS THAT WERE MERELY ANIMAL
1769-143485-0016 WHICH HE WOULD ENJOY IN COMMON WITH OTHER ANIMALS TO WILL AND NOT TO WILL TO WISH AND TO FEAR WOULD BE THE FIRST AND IN A MANNER THE ONLY OPERATIONS OF HIS SOUL TILL NEW CIRCUMSTANCES OCCASIONED NEW DEVELOPMENTS
1769-143485-0017 LET MORALISTS SAY WHAT THEY WILL THE HUMAN UNDERSTANDING IS GREATLY INDEBTED TO THE PASSIONS WHICH ON THEIR SIDE ARE LIKEWISE UNIVERSALLY ALLOWED TO BE GREATLY INDEBTED TO THE HUMAN UNDERSTANDING
1769-143485-0018 IT IS BY THE ACTIVITY OF OUR PASSIONS THAT OUR REASON IMPROVES WE COVET KNOWLEDGE MERELY BECAUSE WE COVET ENJOYMENT AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE WHY A MAN EXEMPT FROM FEARS AND DESIRES SHOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE TO REASON
1769-143485-0019 HE FEARS NO EVIL BUT PAIN AND HUNGER I SAY PAIN AND NOT DEATH FOR NO ANIMAL MERELY AS SUCH WILL EVER KNOW WHAT IT IS TO DIE AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF DEATH AND OF ITS TERRORS
1769-143485-0020 TO WHICH NATURE HAD LEFT THE INHABITANTS EXPOSED OR TO WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES HAD SUBJECTED THEM AND CONSEQUENTLY TO THE PASSIONS WHICH INCLINED THEM TO PROVIDE FOR THESE WANTS
1769-143485-0021 I COULD EXHIBIT IN EGYPT THE ARTS STARTING UP AND EXTENDING THEMSELVES WITH THE INUNDATIONS OF THE NILE I COULD PURSUE THEM IN THEIR PROGRESS AMONG THE GREEKS WHERE THEY WERE SEEN TO BUD FORTH GROW AND RISE TO THE HEAVENS IN THE MIDST OF THE SANDS AND ROCKS OF ATTICA
1769-143485-0022 AS IF NATURE THUS MEANT TO MAKE ALL THINGS EQUAL BY GIVING TO THE MIND THAT FERTILITY SHE HAS DENIED TO THE SOIL BUT EXCLUSIVE OF THE UNCERTAIN TESTIMONIES OF HISTORY
1769-143485-0023 THAT HE CAN NEITHER HAVE FORESIGHT NOR CURIOSITY THE SPECTACLE OF NATURE BY GROWING QUITE FAMILIAR TO HIM BECOMES AT LAST EQUALLY INDIFFERENT IT IS CONSTANTLY THE SAME ORDER CONSTANTLY THE SAME REVOLUTIONS
1769-143485-0024 SUCH IS EVEN AT PRESENT THE DEGREE OF FORESIGHT IN THE CARIBBEAN HE SELLS HIS COTTON BED IN THE MORNING AND COMES IN THE EVENING WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES TO BUY IT BACK NOT HAVING FORESEEN THAT HE SHOULD WANT IT AGAIN THE NEXT NIGHT
1769-143485-0025 THE MORE WE MEDITATE ON THIS SUBJECT THE WIDER DOES THE DISTANCE BETWEEN MERE SENSATION AND THE MOST SIMPLE KNOWLEDGE BECOME IN OUR EYES AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE HOW MAN BY HIS OWN POWERS ALONE
1769-143485-0026 WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF COMMUNICATION AND THE SPUR OF NECESSITY COULD HAVE GOT OVER SO GREAT AN INTERVAL HOW MANY AGES PERHAPS REVOLVED BEFORE MEN BEHELD ANY OTHER FIRE BUT THAT OF THE HEAVENS
1769-143485-0027 WHAT SHALL WE SAY OF AGRICULTURE AN ART WHICH REQUIRES SO MUCH LABOUR AND FORESIGHT WHICH DEPENDS UPON OTHER ARTS WHICH IT IS VERY EVIDENT CANNOT BE PRACTISED BUT IN A SOCIETY IF NOT A FORMED ONE AT LEAST ONE OF SOME STANDING
1769-143485-0028 AND WHICH DOES NOT SO MUCH SERVE TO DRAW ALIMENTS FROM THE EARTH FOR THE EARTH WOULD YIELD THEM WITHOUT ALL THAT TROUBLE AS TO OBLIGE HER TO PRODUCE THOSE THINGS WHICH WE LIKE BEST PREFERABLY TO OTHERS
1769-143485-0029 AND PLANT TREES THAT THEY HAD FOUND OUT THE ART OF GRINDING THEIR CORN AND IMPROVING BY FERMENTATION THE JUICE OF THEIR GRAPES ALL OPERATIONS WHICH WE MUST ALLOW THEM TO HAVE LEARNED FROM THE GODS
1769-143485-0030 AFTER ALL THESE FINE PRESENTS WHAT MAN WOULD BE MAD ENOUGH TO CULTIVATE A FIELD THAT MAY BE ROBBED BY THE FIRST COMER MAN OR BEAST WHO TAKES A FANCY TO THE PRODUCE OF IT
1769-143485-0031 IN A WORD HOW COULD THIS SITUATION ENGAGE MEN TO CULTIVATE THE EARTH AS LONG AS IT WAS NOT PARCELLED OUT AMONG THEM THAT IS AS LONG AS A STATE OF NATURE SUBSISTED
1769-143485-0032 IN A WORD THOUGH WE WERE TO SUPPOSE HIS MIND AS INTELLIGENT AND ENLIGHTENED AS IT MUST AND IS IN FACT FOUND TO BE DULL AND STUPID WHAT BENEFIT WOULD THE SPECIES RECEIVE FROM ALL THESE METAPHYSICAL DISCOVERIES
1769-143485-0033 WHICH COULD NOT BE COMMUNICATED BUT MUST PERISH WITH THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD MADE THEM WHAT PROGRESS COULD MANKIND MAKE IN THE FORESTS SCATTERED UP AND DOWN AMONG THE OTHER ANIMALS AND TO WHAT DEGREE COULD MEN MUTUALLY IMPROVE AND ENLIGHTEN EACH OTHER WHEN THEY HAD NO FIXED HABITATION
1769-143485-0034 LET US BESIDES REFLECT ON THE IMMENSE PAINS AND TIME THAT THE FIRST INVENTION OF LANGUAGES MUST HAVE REQUIRED LET US ADD THESE REFLECTIONS TO THE PRECEDING AND THEN WE MAY JUDGE HOW MANY THOUSAND AGES MUST HAVE BEEN REQUISITE TO DEVELOP SUCCESSIVELY
1769-143485-0035 THE OPERATIONS WHICH THE HUMAN MIND IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING I MUST NOW BEG LEAVE TO STOP ONE MOMENT TO CONSIDER THE PERPLEXITIES ATTENDING THE ORIGIN OF LANGUAGES I MIGHT HERE BARELY CITE OR REPEAT THE RESEARCHES MADE
1769-143485-0036 I THINK IT MY DUTY AT THE SAME TIME THAT I REFER TO HIS REFLECTIONS TO GIVE MY OWN IN ORDER TO EXPOSE THE SAME DIFFICULTIES IN A LIGHT SUITABLE TO MY SUBJECT THE FIRST THAT OFFERS IS HOW LANGUAGES COULD BECOME NECESSARY
1769-143485-0037 I MIGHT SAY WITH MANY OTHERS THAT LANGUAGES ARE THE FRUIT OF THE DOMESTIC INTERCOURSE BETWEEN FATHERS MOTHERS AND CHILDREN BUT THIS BESIDES ITS NOT ANSWERING ANY DIFFICULTIES WOULD BE COMMITTING THE SAME FAULT WITH THOSE WHO REASONING ON THE STATE OF NATURE
1769-143485-0038 WHERE SO MANY COMMON INTERESTS CONSPIRE TO UNITE THEM WHEREAS IN THIS PRIMITIVE STATE AS THERE WERE NEITHER HOUSES NOR CABINS NOR ANY KIND OF PROPERTY
1769-143485-0039 MALES AND FEMALES UNITED WITHOUT ANY PREMEDITATED DESIGN AS CHANCE OCCASION OR DESIRE BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER NOR HAD THEY ANY GREAT OCCASION FOR LANGUAGE TO MAKE KNOWN THEIR THOUGHTS TO EACH OTHER THEY PARTED WITH THE SAME EASE
1769-143485-0040 THE MOTHER SUCKLED HER CHILDREN WHEN JUST BORN FOR HER OWN SAKE BUT AFTERWARDS OUT OF LOVE AND AFFECTION TO THEM WHEN HABIT AND CUSTOM HAD MADE THEM DEAR TO HER
1769-143485-0041 IT IS HE THAT MUST BE AT THE CHIEF EXPENSE OF INVENTION
1769-143485-0042 THIS MAKES THE NUMBER OF LANGUAGES EQUAL TO THAT OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TO SPEAK THEM AND THIS MULTIPLICITY OF LANGUAGES IS FURTHER INCREASED BY THEIR ROVING AND VAGABOND KIND OF LIFE WHICH ALLOWS NO IDIOM TIME ENOUGH TO ACQUIRE ANY CONSISTENCY
1769-143485-0043 FOR TO SAY THAT THE MOTHER WOULD HAVE DICTATED TO THE CHILD THE WORDS HE MUST EMPLOY TO ASK HER THIS THING AND THAT
1769-143485-0044 LET US FOR A MOMENT CONSIDER OURSELVES AT THIS SIDE OF THE IMMENSE SPACE WHICH MUST HAVE SEPARATED THE PURE STATE OF NATURE FROM THAT IN WHICH LANGUAGES BECAME NECESSARY AND LET US AFTER ALLOWING SUCH NECESSITY EXAMINE HOW LANGUAGES COULD BEGIN TO BE ESTABLISHED
1769-143485-0045 A NEW DIFFICULTY THIS STILL MORE STUBBORN THAN THE PRECEDING FOR IF MEN STOOD IN NEED OF SPEECH TO LEARN TO THINK THEY MUST HAVE STOOD IN STILL GREATER NEED OF THE ART OF THINKING TO INVENT THAT OF SPEAKING
1769-143485-0046 AND THOUGH WE COULD CONCEIVE HOW THE SOUNDS OF THE VOICE CAME TO BE TAKEN FOR THE CONVENTIONAL INTERPRETERS OF OUR IDEAS WE SHOULD NOT BE THE NEARER KNOWING WHO COULD HAVE BEEN THE INTERPRETERS OF THIS CONVENTION FOR SUCH IDEAS AS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR NOT HAVING ANY SENSIBLE OBJECTS
1769-143485-0047 COULD NOT BE MADE MANIFEST BY GESTURE OR VOICE SO THAT WE CAN SCARCE FORM ANY TOLERABLE CONJECTURES CONCERNING THE BIRTH OF THIS ART OF COMMUNICATING OUR THOUGHTS AND ESTABLISHING A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN MINDS A SUBLIME ART WHICH THOUGH SO REMOTE FROM ITS ORIGIN
1769-143485-0048 AS THIS CRY WAS NEVER EXTORTED BUT BY A KIND OF INSTINCT IN THE MOST URGENT CASES TO IMPLORE ASSISTANCE IN GREAT DANGER OR RELIEF IN GREAT SUFFERINGS IT WAS OF LITTLE USE IN THE COMMON OCCURRENCES OF LIFE WHERE MORE MODERATE SENTIMENTS GENERALLY PREVAIL
1769-143485-0049 WHEN THE IDEAS OF MEN BEGAN TO EXTEND AND MULTIPLY AND A CLOSER COMMUNICATION BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE AMONG THEM
1769-143485-0050 THEY MULTIPLIED THE INFLECTIONS OF THE VOICE AND ADDED TO THEM GESTURES WHICH ARE IN THEIR OWN NATURE MORE EXPRESSIVE AND WHOSE MEANING DEPENDS LESS ON ANY PRIOR DETERMINATION
1769-143485-0051 THEY THEREFORE EXPRESSED VISIBLE AND MOVABLE OBJECTS BY GESTURES AND THOSE WHICH STRIKE THE EAR BY IMITATIVE SOUNDS BUT AS GESTURES SCARCELY INDICATE ANYTHING EXCEPT OBJECTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY PRESENT OR CAN BE EASILY DESCRIBED
1769-143485-0052 AND VISIBLE ACTIONS AS THEY ARE NOT OF GENERAL USE SINCE DARKNESS OR THE INTERPOSITION OF AN OPAQUE MEDIUM RENDERS THEM USELESS AND AS BESIDES THEY REQUIRE ATTENTION RATHER THAN EXCITE IT
1769-143485-0053 MEN AT LENGTH BETHOUGHT THEMSELVES OF SUBSTITUTING FOR THEM THE ARTICULATIONS OF VOICE WHICH WITHOUT HAVING THE SAME RELATION TO ANY DETERMINATE OBJECT ARE IN QUALITY OF INSTITUTED SIGNS FITTER TO REPRESENT ALL OUR IDEAS
1769-143485-0054 A SUBSTITUTION WHICH COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN MADE BY COMMON CONSENT AND IN A MANNER PRETTY DIFFICULT TO PRACTISE BY MEN WHOSE RUDE ORGANS WERE UNIMPROVED BY EXERCISE
1769-143485-0055 A SUBSTITUTION WHICH IS IN ITSELF MORE DIFFICULT TO BE CONCEIVED SINCE THE MOTIVES TO THIS UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER EXPRESSED AND SPEECH THEREFORE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN EXCEEDINGLY REQUISITE TO ESTABLISH THE USE OF SPEECH
1769-143485-0056 WE MUST ALLOW THAT THE WORDS FIRST MADE USE OF BY MEN HAD IN THEIR MINDS A MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE SIGNIFICATION THAN THOSE EMPLOYED IN LANGUAGES OF SOME STANDING
1769-143485-0057 AND THAT CONSIDERING HOW IGNORANT THEY WERE OF THE DIVISION OF SPEECH INTO ITS CONSTITUENT PARTS THEY AT FIRST GAVE EVERY WORD THE MEANING OF AN ENTIRE PROPOSITION WHEN AFTERWARDS THEY BEGAN TO PERCEIVE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SUBJECT AND ATTRIBUTE
1769-143485-0058 AND EVERY INDIVIDUAL PRESENTED ITSELF SOLITARY TO THEIR MINDS AS IT STANDS IN THE TABLE OF NATURE IF THEY CALLED ONE OAK A THEY CALLED ANOTHER OAK B SO THAT THEIR DICTIONARY MUST HAVE BEEN MORE EXTENSIVE IN PROPORTION AS THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS WAS MORE CONFINED
1769-143485-0059 AS IN ORDER TO MARSHAL THE SEVERAL BEINGS UNDER COMMON AND GENERIC DENOMINATIONS IT WAS NECESSARY TO BE FIRST ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR PROPERTIES AND THEIR DIFFERENCES TO BE STOCKED WITH OBSERVATIONS AND DEFINITIONS THAT IS TO SAY
1769-143485-0060 ADVANTAGES WHICH THE MEN OF THESE TIMES COULD NOT HAVE ENJOYED BESIDES GENERAL IDEAS CANNOT BE CONVEYED TO THE MIND WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF WORDS NOR CAN THE UNDERSTANDING SEIZE THEM WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF PROPOSITIONS
1769-143485-0061 THE DEFINITION OF A TRIANGLE CAN ALONE GIVE YOU A JUST IDEA OF THAT FIGURE THE MOMENT YOU FORM A TRIANGLE IN YOUR MIND IT IS THIS OR THAT PARTICULAR TRIANGLE AND NO OTHER
