7492-99101-0006 EVEN IF HONOUR COULD PERMIT A WOMAN OF HER CHARACTER AND DIGNITY TO ENTERTAIN A THOUGHT OF SECOND NUPTIALS DECENCY AT LEAST MUST FORBID HER TO LISTEN TO HIS ADDRESSES AT A TIME WHEN THE ASHES OF HER HUSBAND AND HIS BENEFACTOR WERE STILL WARM
7492-99101-0007 AND WHILE THE SORROWS OF HER MIND WERE STILL EXPRESSED BY HER MOURNING GARMENTS SHE VENTURED TO DECLARE THAT SHE COULD PLACE LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN THE PROFESSIONS OF A MAN WHOSE CRUEL INCONSTANCY
7492-99101-0008 WAS CAPABLE OF REPUDIATING A FAITHFUL AND AFFECTIONATE WIFE ON THIS REPULSE THE LOVE OF MAXIMIN WAS CONVERTED INTO FURY AND AS WITNESSES AND JUDGES WERE ALWAYS AT HIS DISPOSAL IT WAS EASY FOR HIM TO COVER HIS FURY

7492-99101-0013 AND TO CLOSE THE EYES OF HER AFFLICTED FATHER HE ENTREATED BUT AS HE COULD NO LONGER THREATEN HIS PRAYERS WERE RECEIVED WITH COLDNESS AND DISDAIN AND THE PRIDE OF MAXIMIN WAS GRATIFIED IN TREATING DIOCLETIAN AS A SUPPLIANT
7492-99101-0014 AND HIS DAUGHTER AS A CRIMINAL THE DEATH OF MAXIMIN SEEMED TO ASSURE THE EMPRESSES OF A FAVOURABLE ALTERATION IN THEIR FORTUNE
7492-99101-0015 THE PUBLIC DISORDERS RELAXED THE VIGILANCE OF THEIR GUARD AND THEY EASILY FOUND MEANS TO ESCAPE FROM THE PLACE OF THEIR EXILE AND TO REPAIR THOUGH WITH SOME PRECAUTION AND IN DISGUISE TO THE COURT OF LICINIUS
7492-99101-0016 THE BEHAVIOUR OF LICINIUS IN THE FIRST DAYS OF HIS REIGN AND THE HONOURABLE RECEPTION WHICH HE GAVE TO THE YOUNG CANDIDIANUS
7492-99101-0017 BOTH ON HER OWN ACCOUNT AND ON THAT OF HER ADOPTED SON BUT THESE GRATEFUL PROSPECTS WERE SOON SUCCEEDED BY HORROR AND ASTONISHMENT AND THE BLOODY EXECUTIONS WHICH STAINED THE PALACE OF NICOMEDIA
