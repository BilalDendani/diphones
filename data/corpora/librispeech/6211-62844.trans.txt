6211-62844-0000 AND THE GHOST INCREASED HIS PACE THEN THE MAN BROKE INTO A RUN WITH THE GHOST RIGHT ON HIS HEELS MILE AFTER MILE FASTER AND FASTER
6211-62844-0001 THE GHOST PERCHED BESIDE HIM ON A LARGE ROCK AND BOOMED THAT WAS QUITE A RUN WE HAD YES GASPED THE MAN
6211-62844-0002 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER ONE OUR YOUNG AMERICAN PESSIMISTS SEE MAN AT THE MOMENT HE DROPS BESIDE THE ROAD AND WITHOUT FURTHER INVESTIGATION
6211-62844-0003 IS SOMETHING SO CHARACTERISTIC OF LIFE THAT IT BELONGS IN THE RECORD I HAVE AT LEAST A SNEAKING SUSPICION
6211-62844-0004 THAT NOW AND AGAIN THERE HAPPENS ALONG A RUNNER SO STAUNCH AND COURAGEOUS THAT HE KEEPS UP THE FIGHT UNTIL COCK CROW AND THUS ESCAPES ALL THE APPARITIONS WHICH WOULD OVERTHROW HIM
6211-62844-0005 OR SOME SUCH NAME WHICH CARRIES WITH IT THE HINT OF WISDOM AND THEY ARE WISE UP TO THE VERY POINT OF BELIEVING ONLY THE THINGS THEY HAVE SEEN HOWEVER
6211-62844-0006 I AM NOT SURE THEY ARE QUITE SO WISE WHEN THEY GO A NOTCH BEYOND THIS AND ASSERT ROUNDLY THAT EVERYTHING WHICH THEY HAVE SEEN IS TRUE FOR MY OWN PART I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WHITE RABBITS ARE ACTUALLY BORN IN HIGH HATS THE TRUTH IS QUICKER THAN THE EYE
6211-62844-0007 AND HE WILL UPON REQUEST SUPPLY NAME ADDRESS AND TELEPHONE NUMBER TO CONFOUND THE DOUBTERS
6211-62844-0008 WROTE EUGENE O'NEILL WHEN SOMEBODY OBJECTED THAT THE HEROINE OF DIFF'RENT WAS NOT TRUE THIS OF COURSE SHIFTS THE SCOPE OF THE INQUIRY TO THE QUESTION HOW WELL DOES O'NEILL KNOW HIS EMMAS
6211-62844-0009 THERE WAS NOT A SHADOW OF DOUBT IN THE MIND OF THE PERSON AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS THAT HE HAD COME UPON AN ENEMY ALL THAT IS CHANGED NOW
6211-62844-0010 DURING THE WAR FOR INSTANCE GEORGE SYLVESTER VIERECK WROTE A BOOK TO PROVE THAT EVERY TIME ROOSEVELT SAID VIERECK IS AN UNDESIRABLE CITIZEN OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT
6211-62844-0011 HE WAS SIMPLY DISSEMBLING AN ADMIRATION SO GREAT THAT IT WAS SHOT THROUGH AND THROUGH WITH AMBIVALENT OUTBURSTS OF HATRED MISTER VIERECK MAY NOT HAVE PROVED HIS CASE
6211-62844-0012 BUT HE DID AT LEAST PUT HIS RELATIONS INTO DEBATABLE GROUND BY SHIFTING FROM PHILIP CONSCIOUS TO PHILIP SUBCONSCIOUS IN THE NEW WORLD OF THE PSYCHOANALYSTS
6211-62844-0013 THERE IS CONFUSION FOR THE RATIONALIST EVEN THOUGH HE IS DEALING WITH SOMETHING SO INFERENTIALLY LOGICAL AS A SCIENCE FOR HERE WITH ALL ITS TANGIBLE SYMBOLS IS A SCIENCE WHICH DEALS WITH THINGS WHICH CANNOT BE SEEN OR HEARD OR TOUCHED
6211-62844-0014 NOW WISE MEN HAVE COME FORWARD TO SAY THAT THE KEY TO ALL THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN LIFE LIES IN DREAMS OF COURSE THE POETS HAVE KNOWN THAT FOR YEARS BUT NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THEM
6211-62844-0015 BECAUSE THEY ONLY FELT IT AND OFFERED NO PAPERS TO THE MEDICAL JOURNALS IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO SUGGEST THAT NO DREAMER IS A PESSIMIST THE MOST PROLIFIC PERIOD OF PESSIMISM COMES AT TWENTY ONE OR THEREABOUTS
6211-62844-0016 WHEN THE FIRST ATTEMPT IS MADE TO TRANSLATE DREAMS INTO REALITY AN ATTEMPT BY A PERSON NOT OVER SKILLFUL IN EITHER LANGUAGE OFTEN IT IS MADE IN COLLEGE WHERE A NEW FREEDOM INSPIRES A SOMEWHAT SUDDEN AND WHOLESALE ATTEMPT
6211-62844-0017 TO PUT EVERY VISION TO THE TEST ALONG ABOUT THIS TIME THE YOUNG MAN FINDS THAT THE ROMANTICISTS HAVE LIED TO HIM ABOUT LOVE AND HE BOUNCES ALL THE WAY BACK TO STRINDBERG MAYBE HE GETS DRUNK FOR THE FIRST TIME
6211-62844-0018 AND LEARNS THAT EVERY ENGLISH AUTHOR FROM SHAKESPEARE TO DICKENS HAS VASTLY OVERRATED IT FOR LITERARY EFFECT HE FOLLOWS THE FORMULAE OF FALSTAFF AND INSTEAD OF ACHIEVING A ROARING JOVIALITY HE GOES TO SLEEP PERSONALLY
6211-62844-0019 HUCK'S CORNCOB PIPE HAD ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME ONE OF THE MOST PERSUASIVE SYMBOLS OF TRUE ENJOYMENT
6211-62844-0020 LOOKING AT THE TOWERS OF PRINCETON AND MUSING HERE WAS A NEW GENERATION SHOUTING THE OLD CRIES LEARNING THE OLD CREEDS THROUGH A REVERY OF LONG DAYS AND NIGHTS DESTINED FINALLY TO GO OUT INTO THAT DIRTY GRAY TURMOIL TO FOLLOW LOVE AND PRIDE A
6211-62844-0021 NEW GENERATION DEDICATED MORE THAN THE LAST TO THE FEAR OF POVERTY AND THE WORSHIP OF SUCCESS GROWN UP TO FIND ALL GODS DEAD ALL WARS FOUGHT ALL FAITHS IN MAN SHAKEN
6211-62844-0022 NOBODY WROTE AS WELL AS THAT IN COPELAND'S COURSE AT HARVARD BUT THERE WAS A PRETTY GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT LIFE OR RATHER LIFE WAS A SHAM AND A DELUSION
6211-62844-0023 THIS WAS EXPRESSED IN POEMS LAMENTING THE FACT THAT THE OCEANS AND THE MOUNTAINS WERE GOING TO GO ON
6211-62844-0024 GENERALLY HE DIDN'T GIVE THE OCEANS OR THE MOUNTAINS VERY LONG EITHER ALL THE SHORT STORIES WERE ABOUT MURDER AND MADNESS WE CUT OUR PATTERNS INTO VERY DEFINITE CONCLUSIONS BECAUSE WE WERE PESSIMISTS AND SURE OF OURSELVES
6211-62844-0025 IT WAS THE MOST LOGICAL OF PHILOSOPHIES AND DISPOSED OF ALL LOOSE ENDS ONE OF MY PIECES TO POLISH OFF A THEME ON THE FUTILITY OF HUMAN WISHES WAS ABOUT A MAN WHO WENT STARK RAVING
6211-62844-0026 AND COPELAND SAT IN HIS CHAIR AND GROANED AND MOANED WHICH WAS HIS SUBSTITUTE FOR MAKING LITTLE MARKS IN RED INK HE HAD BEEN READING SHERIDAN'S THE CRITIC TO THE CLASS WITH THE SCENE
6211-62844-0027 IN WHICH THE TWO FAITHLESS SPANISH LOVERS AND THE TWO NIECES AND THE TWO UNCLES ALL TRY TO KILL EACH OTHER AT THE SAME TIME AND ARE THUS THROWN INTO THE MOST TERRIFIC STALEMATE UNTIL THE AUTHOR'S INGENIOUS CONTRIVANCE OF A BEEFEATER WHO CRIES
6211-62844-0028 TRY TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS WITHOUT RECOURSE TO DEATH MADNESS OR ANY OTHER BEEFEATER IN THE QUEEN'S NAME AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE YOUNG PESSIMISTS GENERALLY SPEAKING
6211-62844-0029 HAVE ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE BOUND IN A FORMULA AS TIGHT AS THAT WHICH EVER AFFLICTED ANY POLLYANNA IT ISN'T THE SOMBERNESS WITH WHICH THEY IMBUE LIFE WHICH AROUSES OUR PROTEST SO MUCH AS THE REGULARITY
6211-62844-0030 THEY PAINT LIFE NOT ONLY AS A FAKE FIGHT IN WHICH ONLY ONE RESULT IS POSSIBLE
