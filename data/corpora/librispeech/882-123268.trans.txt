882-123268-0000 SNAEFELL IS FIVE THOUSAND FEET HIGH ITS DOUBLE CONE FORMS THE LIMIT OF A TRACHYTIC BELT WHICH STANDS OUT DISTINCTLY IN THE MOUNTAIN SYSTEM OF THE ISLAND FROM OUR STARTING POINT WE COULD SEE THE TWO PEAKS BOLDLY PROJECTED AGAINST THE DARK GREY SKY
882-123268-0001 I COULD SEE AN ENORMOUS CAP OF SNOW COMING LOW DOWN UPON THE GIANT'S BROW WE WALKED IN SINGLE FILE HEADED BY THE HUNTER WHO ASCENDED BY NARROW TRACKS WHERE TWO COULD NOT HAVE GONE ABREAST THERE WAS THEREFORE NO ROOM FOR CONVERSATION
882-123268-0002 AFTER WE HAD PASSED THE BASALTIC WALL OF THE FIORD OF STAPI WE PASSED OVER A VEGETABLE FIBROUS PEAT BOG LEFT FROM THE ANCIENT VEGETATION OF THIS PENINSULA
882-123268-0003 THIS VAST TURBARY MEASURED IN CERTAIN RAVINES HAD IN MANY PLACES A DEPTH OF SEVENTY FEET AND PRESENTED LAYERS OF CARBONIZED REMAINS OF VEGETATION ALTERNATING WITH THINNER LAYERS OF TUFACEOUS PUMICE
882-123268-0004 AND I CONSTRUCTED FOR MYSELF A COMPLETE GEOLOGICAL ACCOUNT OF ICELAND THIS MOST CURIOUS ISLAND HAS EVIDENTLY BEEN PROJECTED FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
882-123268-0005 POSSIBLY IT MAY STILL BE SUBJECT TO GRADUAL ELEVATION IF THIS IS THE CASE ITS ORIGIN MAY WELL BE ATTRIBUTED TO SUBTERRANEAN FIRES THEREFORE IN THIS CASE THE THEORY OF SIR HUMPHRY DAVY SAKNUSSEMM'S DOCUMENT
882-123268-0006 AND MY UNCLE'S THEORIES WOULD ALL GO OFF IN SMOKE THIS HYPOTHESIS LED ME TO EXAMINE WITH MORE ATTENTION THE APPEARANCE OF THE SURFACE
882-123268-0007 THAT IS TO SAY AN AGGLOMERATION OF POROUS ROCKS AND STONES BEFORE THE VOLCANOES BROKE OUT IT CONSISTED OF TRAP ROCKS SLOWLY UPRAISED TO THE LEVEL OF THE SEA BY THE ACTION OF CENTRAL FORCES
882-123268-0008 THROUGH WHICH WAS GRADUALLY FORCED OUT THE TRACHYTE WHICH WAS TO FORM A MOUNTAIN CHAIN NO VIOLENCE ACCOMPANIED THIS CHANGE THE MATTER THROWN OUT WAS IN VAST QUANTITIES AND THE LIQUID MATERIAL OOZING OUT FROM THE ABYSSES OF THE EARTH SLOWLY SPREAD IN EXTENSIVE PLAINS OR IN HILLOCKY MASSES
882-123268-0009 INCREASED MATERIALLY AND THEREFORE ALSO ITS POWERS OF RESISTANCE IT MAY EASILY BE CONCEIVED WHAT VAST QUANTITIES OF ELASTIC GASES WHAT MASSES OF MOLTEN MATTER ACCUMULATED BENEATH ITS SOLID SURFACE WHILST NO EXIT WAS PRACTICABLE AFTER THE COOLING OF THE TRACHYTIC CRUST
882-123268-0010 THEREFORE A TIME WOULD COME WHEN THE ELASTIC AND EXPLOSIVE FORCES OF THE IMPRISONED GASES WOULD UPHEAVE THIS PONDEROUS COVER AND DRIVE OUT FOR THEMSELVES OPENINGS THROUGH TALL CHIMNEYS HENCE THEN THE VOLCANO WOULD DISTEND AND LIFT UP THE CRUST
882-123268-0011 AND THEN BURST THROUGH A CRATER SUDDENLY FORMED AT THE SUMMIT OR THINNEST PART OF THE VOLCANO TO THE ERUPTION SUCCEEDED OTHER VOLCANIC PHENOMENA THROUGH THE OUTLETS NOW MADE FIRST ESCAPED THE EJECTED BASALT OF WHICH THE PLAIN WE HAD JUST LEFT PRESENTED SUCH MARVELLOUS SPECIMENS
882-123268-0012 WE WERE MOVING OVER GREY ROCKS OF DENSE AND MASSIVE FORMATION WHICH IN COOLING HAD FORMED INTO HEXAGONAL PRISMS EVERYWHERE AROUND US WE SAW TRUNCATED CONES FORMERLY SO MANY FIERY MOUTHS
882-123268-0013 THE POWER OF WHICH GREW BY THE EXTINCTION OF THE LESSER CRATERS SUPPLIED AN EGRESS TO LAVA
882-123268-0014 SUCH WAS THE SUCCESSION OF PHENOMENA WHICH PRODUCED ICELAND
882-123268-0015 AND TO SUPPOSE THAT THE MASS WITHIN DID NOT STILL EXIST IN A STATE OF LIQUID INCANDESCENCE WAS ABSURD AND NOTHING COULD SURPASS THE ABSURDITY OF FANCYING THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO REACH THE EARTH'S CENTRE SO I FELT A LITTLE COMFORTED AS WE ADVANCED TO THE ASSAULT OF SNAEFELL
882-123268-0016 THE WAY WAS GROWING MORE AND MORE ARDUOUS THE ASCENT STEEPER AND STEEPER THE LOOSE FRAGMENTS OF ROCK TREMBLED BENEATH US AND THE UTMOST CARE WAS NEEDED TO AVOID DANGEROUS FALLS HANS WENT ON AS QUIETLY AS IF HE WERE ON LEVEL GROUND
882-123268-0017 SOMETIMES HE DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER BEHIND THE HUGE BLOCKS THEN A SHRILL WHISTLE WOULD DIRECT US ON OUR WAY TO HIM SOMETIMES HE WOULD HALT PICK UP A FEW BITS OF STONE BUILD THEM UP INTO A RECOGNISABLE FORM
882-123268-0018 A VERY WISE PRECAUTION IN ITSELF BUT AS THINGS TURNED OUT QUITE USELESS THREE HOURS FATIGUING MARCH HAD ONLY BROUGHT US TO THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN THERE HANS BID US COME TO A HALT AND A HASTY BREAKFAST WAS SERVED OUT
882-123268-0019 MY UNCLE SWALLOWED TWO MOUTHFULS AT A TIME TO GET ON FASTER
882-123268-0020 WHICH CAME TO PASS IN AN HOUR THE THREE ICELANDERS
882-123268-0021 NEVER SPOKE AND ATE THEIR BREAKFASTS IN SILENCE WE WERE NOW BEGINNING TO SCALE THE STEEP SIDES OF SNAEFELL ITS SNOWY SUMMIT BY AN OPTICAL ILLUSION NOT UNFREQUENT IN MOUNTAINS SEEMED CLOSE TO US AND YET HOW MANY WEARY HOURS IT TOOK TO REACH IT
882-123268-0022 THE STONES ADHERING BY NO SOIL OR FIBROUS ROOTS OF VEGETATION ROLLED AWAY FROM UNDER OUR FEET AND RUSHED DOWN THE PRECIPICE BELOW WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF AN AVALANCHE AT SOME PLACES THE FLANKS OF THE MOUNTAIN FORMED AN ANGLE WITH THE HORIZON OF AT LEAST THIRTY SIX DEGREES
882-123268-0023 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CLIMB THEM AND THESE STONY CLIFFS HAD TO BE TACKED ROUND NOT WITHOUT GREAT DIFFICULTY THEN WE HELPED EACH OTHER WITH OUR STICKS I MUST ADMIT THAT MY UNCLE KEPT AS CLOSE TO ME AS HE COULD HE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF ME
882-123268-0024 HE HIMSELF SEEMED TO POSSESS AN INSTINCT FOR EQUILIBRIUM FOR HE NEVER STUMBLED THE ICELANDERS THOUGH BURDENED WITH OUR LOADS CLIMBED WITH THE AGILITY OF MOUNTAINEERS TO JUDGE BY THE DISTANT APPEARANCE OF THE SUMMIT OF SNAEFELL
882-123268-0025 IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED TOO STEEP TO ASCEND ON OUR SIDE FORTUNATELY AFTER AN HOUR OF FATIGUE AND ATHLETIC EXERCISES IN THE MIDST OF THE VAST SURFACE OF SNOW PRESENTED BY THE HOLLOW BETWEEN THE TWO PEAKS A KIND OF STAIRCASE APPEARED UNEXPECTEDLY
882-123268-0026 WHICH GREATLY FACILITATED OUR ASCENT IT WAS FORMED BY ONE OF THOSE TORRENTS OF STONES FLUNG UP BY THE ERUPTIONS CALLED STING BY THE ICELANDERS IF THIS TORRENT HAD NOT BEEN ARRESTED IN ITS FALL BY THE FORMATION OF THE SIDES OF THE MOUNTAIN
882-123268-0027 SUCH AS IT WAS IT DID US GOOD SERVICE THE STEEPNESS INCREASED BUT THESE STONE STEPS ALLOWED US TO RISE WITH FACILITY AND EVEN WITH SUCH RAPIDITY THAT HAVING RESTED FOR A MOMENT WHILE MY COMPANIONS CONTINUED THEIR ASCENT
882-123268-0028 I PERCEIVED THEM ALREADY REDUCED BY DISTANCE TO MICROSCOPIC DIMENSIONS
882-123268-0029 THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FEET BELOW US STRETCHED THE SEA WE HAD PASSED THE LIMIT OF PERPETUAL SNOW WHICH ON ACCOUNT OF THE MOISTURE OF THE CLIMATE
882-123268-0030 THE COLD WAS EXCESSIVELY KEEN THE WIND WAS BLOWING VIOLENTLY I WAS EXHAUSTED
882-123268-0031 AND IN SPITE OF HIS IMPATIENCE HE DECIDED ON STOPPING HE THEREFORE SPOKE TO THE HUNTER WHO SHOOK HIS HEAD SAYING OFVANFOER IT SEEMS WE MUST GO HIGHER SAID MY UNCLE THEN HE ASKED HANS FOR HIS REASON MISTOUR REPLIED THE GUIDE
882-123268-0032 LOOK SAID MY UNCLE I LOOKED DOWN UPON THE PLAIN AN IMMENSE COLUMN OF PULVERIZED PUMICE SAND AND DUST WAS RISING WITH A WHIRLING CIRCULAR MOTION LIKE A WATERSPOUT THE WIND WAS LASHING IT ON TO THAT SIDE OF SNAEFELL WHERE WE WERE HOLDING ON
882-123268-0033 THIS DENSE VEIL HUNG ACROSS THE SUN THREW A DEEP SHADOW OVER THE MOUNTAIN IF THAT HUGE REVOLVING PILLAR SLOPED DOWN IT WOULD INVOLVE US IN ITS WHIRLING EDDIES THIS PHENOMENON WHICH IS NOT UNFREQUENT WHEN THE WIND BLOWS FROM THE GLACIERS IS CALLED IN ICELANDIC MISTOUR
882-123268-0034 HASTIGT HASTIGT CRIED OUR GUIDE WITHOUT KNOWING DANISH I UNDERSTOOD AT ONCE THAT WE MUST FOLLOW HANS AT THE TOP OF OUR SPEED HE BEGAN TO CIRCLE ROUND THE CONE OF THE CRATER BUT IN A DIAGONAL DIRECTION SO AS TO FACILITATE OUR PROGRESS
882-123268-0035 PRESENTLY THE DUST STORM FELL UPON THE MOUNTAIN WHICH QUIVERED UNDER THE SHOCK THE LOOSE STONES CAUGHT WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE BLASTS OF WIND FLEW ABOUT IN A PERFECT HAIL AS IN AN ERUPTION HAPPILY WE WERE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND SHELTERED FROM ALL HARM
882-123268-0036 BUT FOR THE PRECAUTION OF OUR GUIDE OUR MANGLED BODIES TORN AND POUNDED INTO FRAGMENTS
882-123268-0037 UNKNOWN METEOR YET HANS DID NOT THINK IT PRUDENT TO SPEND THE NIGHT UPON THE SIDES OF THE CONE WE CONTINUED OUR ZIGZAG CLIMB THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED REMAINING FEET TOOK US FIVE HOURS TO CLEAR
882-123268-0038 THE CIRCUITOUS ROUTE THE DIAGONAL AND THE COUNTER MARCHES MUST HAVE MEASURED AT LEAST THREE LEAGUES I COULD STAND IT NO LONGER I WAS YIELDING TO THE EFFECTS OF HUNGER AND COLD THE RAREFIED AIR SCARCELY GAVE PLAY TO THE ACTION OF MY LUNGS
