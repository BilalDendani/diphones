581-126957-0000 AND THEY WERE THERE IN FULL FORCE WATCHING FOR THE ATHENIANS TO LAND THESE LAST HOWEVER GAVE THEM THE SLIP BY COMING IN THE DARK AND BEING INFORMED BY SIGNALS OF THE FACT THE CORINTHIANS LEFT HALF THEIR NUMBER AT CENCHREAE IN CASE THE ATHENIANS SHOULD GO AGAINST CROMMYON
581-126957-0001 WHICH HAD JUST LANDED IN FRONT OF CHERSONESE AND AFTERWARDS THE REST OF THE ARMY THE BATTLE WAS AN OBSTINATE ONE AND FOUGHT THROUGHOUT HAND TO HAND THE RIGHT WING OF THE ATHENIANS AND CARYSTIANS
581-126957-0002 WHO HAD BEEN PLACED AT THE END OF THE LINE RECEIVED AND WITH SOME DIFFICULTY REPULSED THE CORINTHIANS WHO THEREUPON RETREATED TO A WALL UPON THE RISING GROUND BEHIND AND THROWING DOWN THE STONES UPON THEM
581-126957-0003 WERE AGAIN ENGAGED AT CLOSE QUARTERS AT THIS MOMENT A CORINTHIAN COMPANY HAVING COME TO THE RELIEF OF THE LEFT WING ROUTED AND PURSUED THE ATHENIAN RIGHT TO THE SEA
581-126957-0004 MEANWHILE THE REST OF THE ARMY ON EITHER SIDE FOUGHT ON TENACIOUSLY ESPECIALLY THE RIGHT WING OF THE CORINTHIANS WHERE LYCOPHRON SUSTAINED THE ATTACK OF THE ATHENIAN LEFT WHICH IT WAS FEARED MIGHT ATTEMPT THE VILLAGE OF SOLYGIA AFTER HOLDING ON FOR A LONG WHILE WITHOUT EITHER GIVING WAY
581-126957-0005 LYCOPHRON THEIR GENERAL BEING AMONG THE NUMBER THE REST OF THE ARMY BROKEN AND PUT TO FLIGHT IN THIS WAY WITHOUT BEING SERIOUSLY PURSUED OR HURRIED RETIRED TO THE HIGH GROUND AND THERE TOOK UP ITS POSITION THE ATHENIANS FINDING THAT THE ENEMY NO LONGER OFFERED TO ENGAGE THEM
581-126957-0006 AND GOING ON BOARD CROSSED OVER TO THE ISLANDS OPPOSITE AND FROM THENCE SENT A HERALD AND TOOK UP UNDER TRUCE THE BODIES WHICH THEY HAD LEFT BEHIND TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE CORINTHIANS FELL IN THE BATTLE AND RATHER LESS THAN FIFTY ATHENIANS
581-126957-0007 HALIAE AND EPIDAURUS AFTER WALLING OFF THIS SPOT THE FLEET SAILED OFF HOME
581-126957-0008 WHO HAD CROSSED OVER AS I HAVE MENTIONED AFTER THE REVOLUTION AND BECOME MASTERS OF THE COUNTRY TO THE GREAT HURT OF THE INHABITANTS THEIR STRONGHOLD HAVING BEEN TAKEN BY AN ATTACK THE GARRISON TOOK REFUGE IN A BODY UPON SOME HIGH GROUND AND THERE CAPITULATED AGREEING TO GIVE UP THEIR MERCENARY AUXILIARIES
581-126957-0009 LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS AND COMMIT THEMSELVES TO THE DISCRETION OF THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE THE GENERALS CARRIED THEM ACROSS UNDER TRUCE TO THE ISLAND OF PTYCHIA
581-126957-0010 THESE REPRESENTATIONS SUCCEEDING IT WAS SO ARRANGED THAT THE MEN WERE CAUGHT SAILING OUT IN THE BOAT THAT WAS PROVIDED AND THE TREATY BECAME VOID ACCORDINGLY
581-126957-0011 AND AFTERWARDS TAKEN OUT BY TWENTIES AND LED PAST TWO LINES OF HEAVY INFANTRY ONE ON EACH SIDE BEING BOUND TOGETHER AND BEATEN AND STABBED BY THE MEN IN THE LINES WHENEVER ANY SAW PASS A PERSONAL ENEMY
581-126957-0012 WHILE MEN CARRYING WHIPS WENT BY THEIR SIDE AND HASTENED ON THE ROAD THOSE THAT WALKED TOO SLOWLY AS MANY AS SIXTY MEN WERE TAKEN OUT AND KILLED IN THIS WAY WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR FRIENDS IN THE BUILDING WHO FANCIED THEY WERE MERELY BEING MOVED FROM ONE PRISON TO ANOTHER
581-126957-0013 AT LAST HOWEVER SOMEONE OPENED THEIR EYES TO THE TRUTH UPON WHICH THEY CALLED UPON THE ATHENIANS TO KILL THEM THEMSELVES IF SUCH WAS THEIR PLEASURE AND REFUSED ANY LONGER TO GO OUT OF THE BUILDING AND SAID THEY WOULD DO ALL THEY COULD TO PREVENT ANY ONE COMING IN
581-126957-0014 THREW DOWN THE TILES AND LET FLY ARROWS AT THEM FROM WHICH THE PRISONERS SHELTERED THEMSELVES AS WELL AS THEY COULD MOST OF THEIR NUMBER MEANWHILE WERE ENGAGED IN DISPATCHING THEMSELVES BY THRUSTING INTO THEIR THROATS THE ARROWS SHOT BY THE ENEMY AND HANGING THEMSELVES WITH THE CORDS TAKEN FROM SOME BEDS THAT HAPPENED TO BE THERE
581-126957-0015 AND WITH STRIPS MADE FROM THEIR CLOTHING ADOPTING IN SHORT EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS OF SELF DESTRUCTION
581-126957-0016 NIGHT CAME ON WHILE THESE HORRORS WERE ENACTING AND MOST OF IT HAD PASSED BEFORE THEY WERE CONCLUDED
581-126957-0017 ALL THE WOMEN TAKEN IN THE STRONGHOLD WERE SOLD AS SLAVES IN THIS WAY THE CORCYRAEANS OF THE MOUNTAIN WERE DESTROYED BY THE COMMONS AND SO AFTER TERRIBLE EXCESSES THE PARTY STRIFE CAME TO AN END
581-126957-0018 FOR OF ONE PARTY THERE WAS PRACTICALLY NOTHING LEFT MEANWHILE THE ATHENIANS SAILED OFF TO SICILY THEIR PRIMARY DESTINATION AND CARRIED ON THE WAR WITH THEIR ALLIES THERE
581-126957-0019 AND THE ACARNANIANS THEMSELVES SENDING SETTLERS FROM ALL PARTS OF ACARNANIA OCCUPIED THE PLACE SUMMER WAS NOW OVER
581-126957-0020 AS OF THE MANY AMBASSADORS THEY HAD SENT HIM NO TWO EVER TOLD THE SAME STORY IF HOWEVER THEY WERE PREPARED TO SPEAK PLAINLY THEY MIGHT SEND HIM SOME ENVOYS WITH THIS PERSIAN THE ATHENIANS AFTERWARDS SENT BACK ARTAPHERNES IN A GALLEY TO EPHESUS AND AMBASSADORS WITH HIM
581-126957-0021 WHO HEARD THERE OF THE DEATH OF KING ARTAXERXES SON OF XERXES WHICH TOOK PLACE ABOUT THAT TIME AND SO RETURNED HOME THE SAME WINTER THE CHIANS PULLED DOWN THEIR NEW WALL AT THE COMMAND OF THE ATHENIANS
581-126957-0022 AFTER FIRST HOWEVER OBTAINING PLEDGES FROM THE ATHENIANS AND SECURITY AS FAR AS THIS WAS POSSIBLE FOR THEIR CONTINUING TO TREAT THEM AS BEFORE THUS THE WINTER ENDED AND WITH IT ENDED THE SEVENTH YEAR OF THIS WAR OF WHICH THUCYDIDES IS THE HISTORIAN
581-126957-0023 IN FIRST DAYS OF THE NEXT SUMMER THERE WAS AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN AT THE TIME OF NEW MOON AND IN THE EARLY PART OF THE SAME MONTH AN EARTHQUAKE MEANWHILE THE MITYLENIAN AND OTHER LESBIAN EXILES SET OUT FOR THE MOST PART FROM THE CONTINENT WITH MERCENARIES HIRED IN PELOPONNESE
581-126957-0024 AND OTHERS LEVIED ON THE SPOT AND TOOK RHOETEUM BUT RESTORED IT WITHOUT INJURY ON THE RECEIPT OF TWO THOUSAND PHOCAEAN STATERS
581-126957-0025 THEIR PLAN BEING TO FREE ANTANDRUS AND THE REST OF THE ACTAEAN TOWNS FORMERLY OWNED BY MITYLENE BUT NOW HELD BY THE ATHENIANS ONCE FORTIFIED THERE THEY WOULD HAVE EVERY FACILITY FOR SHIP BUILDING FROM THE VICINITY OF IDA AND THE CONSEQUENT ABUNDANCE OF TIMBER
581-126957-0026 AND PLENTY OF OTHER SUPPLIES AND MIGHT FROM THIS BASE EASILY RAVAGE LESBOS WHICH WAS NOT FAR OFF AND MAKE THEMSELVES MASTERS OF THE AEOLIAN TOWNS ON THE CONTINENT
581-126957-0027 WHILE THESE WERE THE SCHEMES OF THE EXILES THE ATHENIANS IN THE SAME SUMMER MADE AN EXPEDITION WITH SIXTY SHIPS TWO THOUSAND HEAVY INFANTRY A FEW CAVALRY AND SOME ALLIED TROOPS FROM MILETUS AND OTHER PARTS AGAINST CYTHERA
581-126957-0028 AND AUTOCLES SON OF TOLMAEUS CYTHERA IS AN ISLAND LYING OFF LACONIA OPPOSITE MALEA THE INHABITANTS ARE LACEDAEMONIANS OF THE CLASS OF THE PERIOECI AND AN OFFICER CALLED THE JUDGE OF CYTHERA WENT OVER TO THE PLACE ANNUALLY FROM SPARTA
581-126957-0029 A GARRISON OF HEAVY INFANTRY WAS ALSO REGULARLY SENT THERE AND GREAT ATTENTION PAID TO THE ISLAND AS IT WAS THE LANDING PLACE FOR THE MERCHANTMEN FROM EGYPT AND LIBYA AND AT THE SAME TIME SECURED LACONIA FROM THE ATTACKS OF PRIVATEERS FROM THE SEA
581-126957-0030 AND WITH THE REST OF THEIR FORCES LANDING ON THE SIDE OF THE ISLAND LOOKING TOWARDS MALEA WENT AGAINST THE LOWER TOWN OF CYTHERA WHERE THEY FOUND ALL THE INHABITANTS ENCAMPED
