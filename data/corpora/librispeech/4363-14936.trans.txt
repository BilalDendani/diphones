4363-14936-0000 OF THEIR EARLY HISTORY LITTLE IS KNOWN BEYOND THE FACT
4363-14936-0001 KNOWN TO BE MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND YEARS OLD WERE FOUND WITHIN THE SACRED PRECINCTS THE DOGS WERE AND ARE TO THIS DAY JEALOUSLY GUARDED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE CHIEF EUNUCH
4363-14936-0002 OF THE COURT AND FEW HAVE EVER FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE OUTER WORLD SO FAR AS THE WRITER IS AWARE THE HISTORY OF THE BREED IN ENGLAND DATES FROM THE IMPORTATION IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY
4363-14936-0003 OF FIVE DOGS TAKEN FROM THE SUMMER PALACE WHERE THEY HAD NO DOUBT BEEN FORGOTTEN ON THE FLIGHT OF THE COURT TO THE INTERIOR ADMIRAL LORD JOHN HAY
4363-14936-0004 WHO WAS PRESENT ON ACTIVE SERVICE
4363-14936-0005 IN A PART OF THE GARDEN FREQUENTED BY AN AUNT OF THE EMPEROR WHO HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE ON THE APPROACH OF THE ALLIED FORCES LORD JOHN AND ANOTHER NAVAL OFFICER
4363-14936-0006 LORD JOHN TOOK PAINS TO ASCERTAIN THAT NONE HAD FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE FRENCH CAMP AND HE HEARD THEN
4363-14936-0007 WHICH LASTED MORE THAN TWO YEARS BUT WE SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING CONFIRMATION OF WHAT WE HAD ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD NAMELY THAT THE PALACE DOGS ARE RIGIDLY GUARDED
4363-14936-0008 AND THAT THEIR THEFT IS PUNISHABLE BY DEATH AT THE TIME OF THE BOXER REBELLION ONLY SPANIELS PUGS AND POODLES WERE FOUND IN THE IMPERIAL PALACE
4363-14936-0009 THE DUCHESS OF RICHMOND OCCASIONALLY GAVE AWAY A DOG TO INTIMATE FRIENDS SUCH AS THE DOWAGER LADY WHARNCLIFFE LADY DOROTHY NEVILL AND OTHERS
4363-14936-0010 BUT IN THOSE DAYS THE PEKINESE WAS PRACTICALLY AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY AND IT CAN THEREFORE BE MORE READILY UNDERSTOOD WHAT INTEREST WAS AROUSED ABOUT ELEVEN YEARS AGO BY THE APPEARANCE OF A SMALL DOG
4363-14936-0011 TO THOSE SO CAREFULLY CHERISHED AT GOODWOOD
4363-14936-0012 AH CUM OWNED BY MISSUS DOUGLAS MURRAY WHOSE HUSBAND HAVING EXTENSIVE INTERESTS IN CHINA HAD MANAGED AFTER MANY YEARS TO SECURE A TRUE PALACE DOG SMUGGLED IN A BOX OF HAY
4363-14936-0013 AH CUM WAS MATED WITHOUT DELAY TO TWO GOODWOOD BITCHES THE RESULT BEING IN THE FIRST LITTERS
4363-14936-0014 TO THESE THREE SIRES
4363-14936-0015 GOODWOOD MING MARLAND MYTH AND OTHERS IT MUST HOWEVER BE CLEARLY ADMITTED THAT SINCE THE POPULARITY OF THE BREED HAS BECOME ESTABLISHED
4363-14936-0016 WHO HAVE LOST ALL RESEMBLANCE TO THE ORIGINAL TYPE AND FOR THIS THE PEKINESE CLUB IS IN SOME MEASURE TO BLAME THE ORIGINAL POINTS FOR THE GUIDANCE OF BREEDERS AND JUDGES WERE DRAWN UP
4363-14936-0017 SINCE THEN THE CLUB HAS AMENDED THE SCALE OF POINTS NO DOUBT IN ORDER TO SECURE A LARGER MEMBERSHIP AND THE MAXIMUM NOW STANDS AT EIGHTEEN POUNDS
4363-14936-0018 IS IT THEREFORE TO BE WONDERED AT THAT CONFUSION EXISTS AS TO WHAT IS THE TRUE TYPE AT SHOWS
4363-14936-0019 WIDE AND FLAT BETWEEN THE EARS NOT DOME SHAPED WIDE BETWEEN THE EYES NOSE BLACK BROAD VERY SHORT AND FLAT
4363-14936-0020 EYES LARGE DARK PROMINENT ROUND LUSTROUS STOP DEEP EARS HEART SHAPED
4363-14936-0021 NOT SET TOO HIGH LEATHER NEVER LONG ENOUGH TO COME BELOW THE MUZZLE NOT CARRIED ERECT BUT RATHER DROOPING LONG FEATHER
4363-14936-0022 MUZZLE VERY SHORT AND BROAD NOT UNDERHUNG NOR POINTED WRINKLED MANE PROFUSE
4363-14936-0023 BROAD CHEST FALLING AWAY LIGHTER BEHIND LION LIKE NOT TOO LONG IN THE BODY
4363-14936-0024 LONG WITH THICK UNDERCOAT STRAIGHT AND FLAT NOT CURLY NOR WAVY RATHER COARSE BUT SOFT FEATHER ON THIGHS
4363-14936-0025 LEGS TAIL AND TOES LONG AND PROFUSE
4363-14936-0026 BLACK MASKS AND SPECTACLES ROUND THE EYES WITH LINES TO THE EARS ARE DESIRABLE LEGS SHORT FORE LEGS HEAVY
4363-14936-0027 BOWED OUT AT ELBOWS HIND LEGS LIGHTER BUT FIRM AND WELL SHAPED FEET FLAT NOT ROUND SHOULD STAND WELL UP ON TOES
4363-14936-0028 NOT ON ANKLES TAIL CURLED AND CARRIED WELL UP ON LOINS LONG PROFUSE STRAIGHT FEATHER SIZE
4363-14936-0029 BEING A TOY DOG THE SMALLER THE BETTER PROVIDED TYPE AND POINTS ARE NOT SACRIFICED ANYTHING OVER EIGHTEEN POUNDS SHOULD DISQUALIFY WHEN DIVIDED BY WEIGHT
4363-14936-0030 CROSSING FEET OR THROWING THEM OUT IN RUNNING SHOULD NOT TAKE OFF MARKS WEAKNESS OF JOINTS SHOULD BE PENALISED LADY ALGERNON GORDON LENNOX
4363-14936-0031 HAS OCCASIONALLY BEEN CRITICISED FOR HER ADVOCACY OF WHOLE COLOURED SPECIMENS BUT IN SUPPORT OF THIS PREFERENCE IT CAN BE PROVED THAT THE ORIGINAL PAIR BROUGHT TO GOODWOOD
4363-14936-0032 AS WELL AS MISSUS MURRAY'S AH CUM
4363-14936-0033 AND AS NO BRINDLED PARTI COLOURED OR BLACK DOG HAS EVER BEEN BORN AT GOODWOOD OR BROUGHTON
4363-14936-0034 AS AN IMPORTANT POINT THIS VIEW WAS IN THE FIRST PLACE CONFIRMED BY THE LATE CHINESE AMBASSADOR IN LONDON AND FURTHER BY BARON SPECK VON STERNBERG
4363-14936-0035 AND HAD VERY SPECIAL FACILITIES FOR NOTING THE POINTS OF THE PALACE DOGS IN EVERY CASE A BLACK MUZZLE IS INDISPENSABLE ALSO BLACK POINTS TO THE EARS
4363-14936-0036 WITH TROUSERS TAIL AND FEATHERING A SOMEWHAT LIGHTER SHADE THAN THE BODY
4363-14936-0037 ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF THE BITCHES FOR INSTANCE A PINKISH TINGE
4363-14936-0038 RESEMBLES MOST NEARLY THE OLD GOODWOOD DOGS HE HAS THE SAME SQUARE COBBY APPEARANCE BROAD CHEST BOWED LEGS PROFUSE FEATHER AND LARGE LUSTROUS EYES
4363-14936-0039 POINTS WHICH ARE FREQUENTLY LOOKED FOR IN VAIN NOWADAYS AND HIS BREEDER AND OWNER MAY WELL BE PROUD OF HIM THE PEKINESE DIFFERS FROM THE JAPANESE DOG
4363-14936-0040 IN THAT IT APPEARS TO BE FAR STRONGER IN CONSTITUTION AND WITHSTANDS THE CHANGES OF THE ENGLISH CLIMATE WITH MUCH GREATER EASE IN FACT THEY ARE AS HARDY
4363-14936-0041 UNDER HEALTHY CONDITIONS AS ANY ENGLISH BREED
4363-14936-0042 WHICH IS DEVELOPING IN THE EYES SMALL ABSCESSES FREQUENTLY APPEAR WHEN THE PUPPIES ARE A FEW MONTHS OLD AND ALTHOUGH THEY MAY NOT AFFECT THE SIGHT
4363-14936-0043 THEY ALMOST INEVITABLY LEAVE A BLUISH MARK WHILE IN SOME CASES THE EYE ITSELF BECOMES CONTRACTED WHETHER THIS IS ONE OF THE RESULTS OF IN BREEDING IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY
4363-14936-0044 THIS WAS DISCOVERED AT GOODWOOD YEARS AGO BY THE FACT THAT ON TWO OR THREE OCCASIONS ONE CELESTIAL LADY WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN GREATER ATTENTION THAN SHE CONSIDERED NECESSARY
4363-14936-0045 REVENGED HERSELF BY DEVOURING HER OWN FAMILY OF PUPPIES ONE THING SEEMS FROM EXPERIENCE TO BE ESPECIALLY ADVISABLE
4363-14936-0046 IS MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP WELL THAN ONE BORN IN THE AUTUMN GREAT ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID WITH REFERENCE TO THE FREQUENT
4363-14936-0047 WHICH TROUBLE SEEMS MORE PREVALENT WITH PEKINESE
4363-14936-0048 WHEREVER POSSIBLE FISH SHOULD BE GIVEN AS PART OF THE DIETARY SOME PEKINESE DEVOUR IT WITH RELISH OTHERS WILL NOT TOUCH IT BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT
4363-14936-0049 IT IS A USEFUL ITEM IN THE BILL OF FARE BREAD WELL SOAKED IN VERY STRONG STOCK SHEEP'S HEAD AND LIVER ARE ALWAYS BETTER AS REGULAR DIET THAN MEAT
4363-14936-0050 BUT IN CASES OF DEBILITY A LITTLE RAW MEAT GIVEN ONCE A DAY IS MOST BENEFICIAL IT WOULD NOT BE FITTING TO CLOSE AN ARTICLE ON PEKINESE
4363-14936-0051 THAT QUALITY IS MORE ESSENTIAL THAN QUANTITY AS THEIR BREED NAME IMPLIES THESE TINY BLACK AND WHITE LONG HAIRED LAP DOGS ARE REPUTED TO BE NATIVES OF THE LAND OF THE CHRYSANTHEMUM
4363-14936-0052 THE JAPANESE WHO HAVE TREASURED THEM FOR CENTURIES HAVE THE BELIEF THAT THEY ARE NOT LESS ANCIENT THAN THE DOGS OF MALTA THERE SEEMS TO BE A PROBABILITY HOWEVER
4363-14936-0053 THE HON MISSUS MC LAREN MORRISON AN AUTHORITY ON EXOTIC DOGS WHOSE OPINION MUST ALWAYS BE TAKEN WITH RESPECT
4363-14936-0054 WHILE OTHER EXPERTS ARE EQUALLY OF OPINION
4363-14936-0055 THAT THEY ARE INDIGENOUS TO THE FAR EAST WHENCE WE HAVE DERIVED SO MANY OF OUR SMALL SNUB NOSED LARGE EYED AND LONG HAIRED PETS THE ORIENTAL PEOPLES
4363-14936-0056 HAVE ALWAYS BRED THEIR LAP DOGS TO SMALL SIZE CONVENIENT FOR CARRYING IN THE SLEEVE THE SLEEVE DOG AND THE CHIN DOG ARE COMMON AND APPROPRIATE APPELLATIONS IN THE EAST
4363-14936-0057 THE JAPANESE SPANIEL WAS CERTAINLY KNOWN IN ENGLAND HALF A CENTURY AGO AND PROBABLY MUCH EARLIER
4363-14936-0058 IT WAS BY CROSSING WITH THE ALREADY LONG ESTABLISHED KING CHARLES OR BLENHEIM SPANIELS
4363-14936-0059 OR WHITE WITH LEMON YELLOW PATCHES THE COLOURING OTHER THAN WHITE WAS USUALLY ABOUT THE LONG FRINGED EARS AND THE CROWN OF THE HEAD WITH A LINE OF WHITE
4363-14936-0060 AS FAR AS THE OCCIPUT THIS BLAZE UP THE FACE WAS COMMONLY SAID TO RESEMBLE THE BODY OF A BUTTERFLY WHOSE CLOSED WINGS
4363-14936-0061 WERE REPRESENTED BY THE DOG'S EXPANSIVE EARS THE WHITE AND BLACK COLOURING IS NOW THE MOST FREQUENT THE POINTS DESIRED ARE A BROAD AND ROUNDED SKULL
4363-14936-0062 LARGE IN PROPORTION TO THE DOG'S BODY A WIDE STRONG MUZZLE AND A TURNED UP LOWER JAW
4363-14936-0063 THE BACK SHOULD BE SHORT AND LEVEL THE LEGS ARE BY PREFERENCE SLENDER AND MUCH FEATHERED THE FEET LARGE AND WELL SEPARATED AN IMPORTANT POINT IS THE COAT
4363-14936-0064 IT SHOULD BE ABUNDANT PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE NECK WHERE IT FORMS A RUFFLE
4363-14936-0065 AND MANUFACTURED FOODS ARE TO BE AVOIDED RICE USUALLY AGREES WELL FRESH FISH SHEEP'S HEAD TONGUE CHICKEN LIVERS MILK
4363-14936-0066 OR BATTER PUDDINGS ARE ALSO SUITABLE AND OCCASIONALLY GIVE OATMEAL PORRIDGE ALTERNATED WITH A LITTLE SCRAPED RAW MEAT AS AN ESPECIAL FAVOUR FOR PUPPIES NEWLY WEANED
4363-14936-0067 IT IS WELL TO LIMIT THE SUPPLY OF MILK FOODS AND TO AVOID RED MEAT FINELY MINCED RABBIT OR FISH ARE BETTER
4363-14936-0068 OF THE JAPANESE SPANIELS WHICH HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PROMINENT IN COMPETITION MAY BE MENTIONED MISS SERENA'S CHAMPION FUJI OF KOBE A REMARKABLY BEAUTIFUL BITCH
4363-14936-0069 TORA OF BRAYWICK A FINE RED AND WHITE DOG SOMEWHAT OVER SEVEN POUNDS IS ALSO TO BE REMEMBERED AS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE OF THE BREED TOGETHER WITH KARA
4363-14936-0070 LADY SAMUELSON'S TOGO
4363-14936-0071 THERE HAS LATELY BEEN A TENDENCY TO LAY TOO MUCH STRESS UPON
4363-14936-0072 BUT ON THE WHOLE IT MAY BE STATED WITH CONFIDENCE THAT THE JAPANESE IS PROSPERING IN ENGLAND THANKS LARGELY TO THE ENERGETIC WORK OF THE JAPANESE CHIN CLUB WHICH WAS FORMED SOME THREE YEARS AGO
4363-14936-0073 TO PROMOTE THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE BREED THE FOLLOWING IS THE OFFICIAL STANDARD ISSUED BY THE CLUB HEAD SHOULD BE LARGE FOR SIZE OF ANIMAL
4363-14936-0074 MUZZLE STRONG AND WIDE VERY SHORT FROM EYES TO NOSE UPPER JAW SHOULD LOOK SLIGHTLY TURNED UP BETWEEN THE EYES
4363-14936-0075 OR FINISHED SO AS TO MEET IT BUT SHOULD THE LOWER JAW BE SLIGHTLY UNDERHUNG IT IS NOT A BLEMISH PROVIDED THE TEETH ARE NOT SHOWN IN CONSEQUENCE NOSE
4363-14936-0076 VERY SHORT IN THE MUZZLE PART THE END OR NOSE PROPER SHOULD BE WIDE WITH OPEN NOSTRILS
4363-14936-0077 BLACK IN BLACK MARKED DOGS
4363-14936-0078 IN RED OR LEMON MARKED DOGS EYES LARGE DARK LUSTROUS
4363-14936-0079 EARS SMALL AND V SHAPED NICELY FEATHERED SET WIDE APART AND HIGH ON THE HEAD AND CARRIED SLIGHTLY FORWARD NECK
4363-14936-0080 SHOULD BE SHORT AND MODERATELY THICK BODY VERY COMPACT AND SQUARELY BUILT WITH A SHORT BACK RATHER WIDE CHEST
4363-14936-0081 THE BODY AND LEGS SHOULD REALLY GO INTO A SQUARE
4363-14936-0082 THE LENGTH OF THE DOG SHOULD BE ABOUT ITS HEIGHT LEGS THE BONES OF THE LEGS SHOULD BE SMALL GIVING THEM A SLENDER APPEARANCE
4363-14936-0083 IT SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY FREE FROM WAVE OR CURL AND NOT LIE TOO FLAT BUT HAVE A TENDENCY TO STAND OUT ESPECIALLY AT THE NECK SO AS TO GIVE A THICK MANE OR RUFF
4363-14936-0084 WHICH WITH PROFUSE FEATHERING ON THIGHS AND TAIL GIVES A VERY SHOWY APPEARANCE
4363-14936-0085 EITHER BLACK AND WHITE OR RED AND WHITE
4363-14936-0086 THE TERM RED INCLUDES ALL SHADES SABLE BRINDLE LEMON OR ORANGE BUT THE BRIGHTER AND CLEARER THE RED THE BETTER THE WHITE SHOULD BE CLEAR WHITE
4363-14936-0087 WHETHER BLACK OR RED SHOULD BE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED IN PATCHES OVER THE BODY CHEEKS AND EARS HEIGHT AT SHOULDER ABOUT TEN INCHES WEIGHT
