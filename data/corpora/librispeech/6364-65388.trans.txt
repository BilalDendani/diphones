6364-65388-0000 ARE DEVELOPED IN FILLING THIS SINGLE DOORWAY FOOTNOTE THE TYMPANUM OF THE SOUTH TRANSCEPT DOOR IT IS TO BE FOUND GENERALLY AMONG ALL COLLECTIONS OF ARCHITECTURAL PHOTOGRAPHS
6364-65388-0001 SITTING SULKILY IN THE CORNER HE HUGS HIS BOOK WITH BOTH HANDS AND WON'T GET UP TO TAKE HIS CROSIER
6364-65388-0002 AND HERE'S ONE OF THE MONKS IN THE OPPOSITE CORNER WHO IS QUITE COOL ABOUT IT AND THINKS THEY'LL GET ON WELL ENOUGH WITHOUT SAINT HONORE YOU SEE THAT IN HIS FACE PERFECTLY
6364-65388-0003 AND HAS HIS BOOK NOW GRANDLY ON HIS DESK INSTEAD OF HIS KNEES AND HE DIRECTS ONE OF HIS VILLAGE CURATES HOW TO FIND RELICS IN A WOOD HERE IS THE WOOD AND HERE IS THE VILLAGE CURATE
6364-65388-0004 WHICH OCCURRENCE AFTERWARDS WAS PAINTED FOR THE ARMS OF THE ABBEY
6364-65388-0005 AND HERE IS HIS TOMB WITH HIS STATUE ON THE TOP AND MIRACLES ARE BEING PERFORMED AT IT A DEAF MAN HAVING HIS EAR TOUCHED AND A BLIND MAN GROPING HIS WAY UP TO THE TOMB WITH HIS DOG
6364-65388-0006 BOWED ITS HEAD IN TOKEN OF ACCEPTANCE AS THE RELICS OF SAINT HONORE PASSED BENEATH NOW JUST CONSIDER THE AMOUNT OF SYMPATHY WITH HUMAN NATURE AND OBSERVANCE OF IT
6364-65388-0007 THE SYMPATHY WITH DISPUTING MONKS WITH PUZZLED ALDERMEN WITH MELANCHOLY RECLUSE WITH TRIUMPHANT PRELATE WITH PALSY STRICKEN POVERTY WITH ECCLESIASTICAL MAGNIFICENCE OR MIRACLE WORKING FAITH
6364-65388-0008 DESIGN THESE RICH AND QUAINT FRAGMENTS OF TOMBS AND ALTARS WEAVE WITH PERFECT ANIMATION THE ENTANGLED BRANCHES OF THE FOREST BUT YOU WILL ANSWER ME ALL THIS IS NOT ARCHITECTURE AT ALL IT IS SCULPTURE
6364-65388-0009 WILL YOU THEN TELL ME PRECISELY WHERE THE SEPARATION EXISTS BETWEEN ONE AND THE OTHER WE WILL BEGIN AT THE VERY BEGINNING I WILL SHOW YOU A PIECE OF WHAT YOU WILL CERTAINLY ADMIT TO BE A PIECE OF PURE ARCHITECTURE
6364-65388-0010 WHICH YOU CALL I SUPPOSE IMPURE WELL LOOK ON THIS PICTURE AND ON THIS DON'T LAUGH YOU MUST NOT LAUGH THAT'S VERY IMPROPER OF YOU THIS IS CLASSICAL ARCHITECTURE I HAVE TAKEN IT OUT OF THE ESSAY ON THAT SUBJECT IN THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA
6364-65388-0011 YET I SUPPOSE NONE OF YOU WOULD THINK YOURSELVES PARTICULARLY INGENIOUS ARCHITECTS IF YOU HAD DESIGNED NOTHING MORE THAN THIS NAY I WILL EVEN LET YOU IMPROVE IT INTO ANY GRAND PROPORTION YOU CHOOSE
6364-65388-0012 WE WANT A FEW MOULDINGS YOU WILL SAY JUST A FEW THOSE WHO WANT MOULDINGS HOLD UP THEIR HANDS WE ARE UNANIMOUS I THINK WILL YOU THEN DESIGN THE PROFILES OF THESE MOULDINGS YOURSELVES OR WILL YOU COPY THEM IF YOU WISH TO COPY THEM
6364-65388-0013 BUT IF YOU WISH TO DESIGN THEM YOURSELVES HOW DO YOU DO IT
6364-65388-0014 AND YOU ORDER YOUR MASON TO CUT IT NOW WILL YOU TELL ME THE LOGICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DRAWING THE PROFILE OF A MOULDING AND GIVING THAT TO BE CUT AND DRAWING THE FOLDS OF THE DRAPERY OF A STATUE AND GIVING THOSE TO BE CUT
6364-65388-0015 AND SCULPTURE ANYTHING THAT IS DIFFICULT IT IS TRUE ALSO THAT THE CARVED MOULDING REPRESENTS NOTHING AND THE CARVED DRAPERY REPRESENTS SOMETHING BUT YOU WILL NOT I SHOULD THINK ACCEPT AS AN EXPLANATION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE
6364-65388-0016 THIS ANY MORE THAN THE OTHER THAT SCULPTURE IS ART WHICH HAS MEANING AND ARCHITECTURE ART WHICH HAS NONE WHERE THEN IS YOUR DIFFERENCE IN THIS PERHAPS YOU WILL SAY
6364-65388-0017 THAT WHATEVER ORNAMENTS WE CAN DIRECT OURSELVES AND GET ACCURATELY CUT TO ORDER WE CONSIDER ARCHITECTURAL THE ORNAMENTS THAT WE ARE OBLIGED TO LEAVE TO THE PLEASURE OF THE WORKMAN OR THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF SOME OTHER DESIGNER WE CONSIDER SCULPTURAL
6364-65388-0018 FOR INSTANCE YOU ALL KNOW THE PULPIT OF NICCOLO PISANO IN THE BAPTISTRY AT PISA IT IS COMPOSED OF SEVEN RICH RELIEVI SURROUNDED BY PANEL MOULDINGS AND SUSTAINED ON MARBLE SHAFTS
6364-65388-0019 DO YOU SUPPOSE NICCOLO PISANO'S REPUTATION SUCH PART OF IT AT LEAST AS RESTS ON THIS PULPIT AND MUCH DOES DEPENDS ON THE PANEL MOULDINGS OR ON THE RELIEVI THE PANEL MOULDINGS ARE BY HIS HAND
6364-65388-0020 HE WOULD HAVE DISDAINED TO LEAVE EVEN THEM TO A COMMON WORKMAN BUT DO YOU THINK HE FOUND ANY DIFFICULTY IN THEM OR THOUGHT THERE WAS ANY CREDIT IN THEM HAVING ONCE DONE THE SCULPTURE THOSE ENCLOSING LINES WERE MERE CHILD'S PLAY TO HIM
6364-65388-0021 THAT ALSO CONSISTS OF RICH AND MULTITUDINOUS BAS RELIEFS ENCLOSED IN PANEL MOULDINGS WITH SHAFTS OF MOSAIC AND FOLIATED ARCHES SUSTAINING THE CANOPY
6364-65388-0022 HERE ON THIS SCULPTURED SHIELD RESTS THE MASTER'S HAND THIS IS THE CENTRE OF THE MASTER'S THOUGHT FROM THIS AND IN SUBORDINATION TO THIS WAVED THE ARCH AND SPRANG THE PINNACLE
6364-65388-0023 HAVING DONE THIS AND BEING ABLE TO GIVE HUMAN EXPRESSION AND ACTION TO THE STONE ALL THE REST THE RIB THE NICHE THE FOIL THE SHAFT WERE MERE TOYS TO HIS HAND AND ACCESSORIES TO HIS CONCEPTION AND IF ONCE YOU ALSO GAIN THE GIFT OF DOING THIS
6364-65388-0024 IF ONCE YOU CAN CARVE ONE FRONTON SUCH AS YOU HAVE HERE I TELL YOU YOU WOULD BE ABLE SO FAR AS IT DEPENDED ON YOUR INVENTION TO SCATTER CATHEDRALS OVER ENGLAND AS FAST AS CLOUDS RISE FROM ITS STREAMS AFTER SUMMER RAIN
6364-65388-0025 NAY BUT PERHAPS YOU ANSWER AGAIN OUR SCULPTORS AT PRESENT DO NOT DESIGN CATHEDRALS AND COULD NOT NO THEY COULD NOT BUT THAT IS MERELY BECAUSE WE HAVE MADE ARCHITECTURE SO DULL THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE ANY INTEREST IN IT
6364-65388-0026 AND THEREFORE DO NOT CARE TO ADD TO THEIR HIGHER KNOWLEDGE THE POOR AND COMMON KNOWLEDGE OF PRINCIPLES OF BUILDING YOU HAVE THUS SEPARATED BUILDING FROM SCULPTURE AND YOU HAVE TAKEN AWAY THE POWER OF BOTH
6364-65388-0027 FOR THE SCULPTOR LOSES NEARLY AS MUCH BY NEVER HAVING ROOM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CONTINUOUS WORK AS YOU DO FROM HAVING REDUCED YOUR WORK TO A CONTINUITY OF MECHANISM YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE THE SAME BODY OF MEN
6364-65388-0028 ADMITTING ONLY SUCH DIFFERENCE IN OPERATION AS THERE IS BETWEEN THE WORK OF A PAINTER AT DIFFERENT TIMES WHO SOMETIMES LABOURS ON A SMALL PICTURE AND SOMETIMES ON THE FRESCOES OF A PALACE GALLERY THIS CONCLUSION THEN WE ARRIVE AT
6364-65388-0029 MUST ARRIVE AT THE FACT BEING IRREVOCABLY SO THAT IN ORDER TO GIVE YOUR IMAGINATION AND THE OTHER POWERS OF YOUR SOULS FULL PLAY YOU MUST DO AS ALL THE GREAT ARCHITECTS OF OLD TIME DID
6364-65388-0030 NOTHING THAT IS GREAT IS EASY AND NOTHING THAT IS GREAT SO LONG AS YOU STUDY BUILDING WITHOUT SCULPTURE CAN BE IN YOUR WAY I WANT TO PUT IT IN YOUR WAY AND YOU TO FIND YOUR WAY TO IT
6364-65388-0031 BUT ON THE OTHER HAND DO NOT SHRINK FROM THE TASK AS IF THE REFINED ART OF PERFECT SCULPTURE WERE ALWAYS REQUIRED FROM YOU FOR THOUGH ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE ARE NOT SEPARATE ARTS THERE IS AN ARCHITECTURAL MANNER OF SCULPTURE
6364-65388-0032 JOHN LEECH DOES NOT SKETCH SO WELL AS LEONARDO DA VINCI BUT DO YOU THINK THAT THE PUBLIC COULD EASILY SPARE HIM OR THAT HE IS WRONG IN BRINGING OUT HIS TALENT IN THE WAY IN WHICH IT IS MOST EFFECTIVE WOULD YOU ADVISE HIM IF HE ASKED YOUR ADVICE
6364-65388-0033 AND YET DO NOT YOU SEE THAT YOU ARE DOING PRECISELY THE SAME THING WITH YOUR POWERS OF SCULPTURAL DESIGN THAT HE WOULD BE DOING WITH HIS POWERS OF PICTORIAL DESIGN IF HE GAVE YOU NOTHING BUT SUCH LINES YOU FEEL THAT YOU CANNOT CARVE LIKE PHIDIAS
6364-65388-0034 THAT POPULAR POWER OF EXPRESSION WHICH IS WITHIN THE ATTAINMENT OF THOUSANDS AND WOULD ADDRESS ITSELF TO TENS OF THOUSANDS IS UTTERLY LOST TO US IN STONE THOUGH IN INK AND PAPER IT HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST DESIRED LUXURIES OF MODERN CIVILIZATION
6364-65388-0035 AND FROM MERE GEOMETRICAL DECORATION ON THE OTHER AND FIRST OBSERVE WHAT AN INDULGENCE WE HAVE IN THE DISTANCE AT WHICH MOST WORK IS TO BE SEEN SUPPOSING WE WERE ABLE TO CARVE EYES AND LIPS WITH THE MOST EXQUISITE PRECISION
6364-65388-0036 IT WOULD ALL BE OF NO USE AS SOON AS THE WORK WAS PUT FAR ABOVE THE EYE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND AS BEAUTIES DISAPPEAR BY BEING FAR WITHDRAWN SO WILL FAULTS AND THE MYSTERY AND CONFUSION WHICH ARE THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF DISTANCE
6364-65388-0037 OFTEN A DEEP CUT OR A RUDE ANGLE WILL PRODUCE IN CERTAIN POSITIONS AN EFFECT OF EXPRESSION BOTH STARTLING AND TRUE WHICH YOU NEVER HOPED FOR NOT THAT MERE DISTANCE WILL GIVE ANIMATION TO THE WORK IF IT HAS NONE IN ITSELF
6364-65388-0038 BUT IF IT HAS LIFE AT ALL THE DISTANCE WILL MAKE THAT LIFE MORE PERCEPTIBLE AND POWERFUL BY SOFTENING THE DEFECTS OF EXECUTION SO THAT YOU ARE PLACED AS WORKMEN IN THIS POSITION OF SINGULAR ADVANTAGE THAT YOU MAY GIVE YOUR FANCIES FREE PLAY
6364-65388-0039 AND STRIKE HARD FOR THE EXPRESSION THAT YOU WANT KNOWING THAT IF YOU MISS IT NO ONE WILL DETECT YOU IF YOU AT ALL TOUCH IT NATURE HERSELF WILL HELP YOU
6364-65388-0040 AND WITH EVERY CHANGING SHADOW AND BASKING SUNBEAM BRING FORTH NEW PHASES OF YOUR FANCY BUT IT IS NOT MERELY THIS PRIVILEGE OF BEING IMPERFECT WHICH BELONGS TO ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE IT HAS A TRUE PRIVILEGE OF IMAGINATION
6364-65388-0041 FOR OBSERVE TO THAT SCULPTURE THE SPECTATOR IS USUALLY BROUGHT IN A TRANQUIL OR PROSAIC STATE OF MIND HE SEES IT ASSOCIATED RATHER WITH WHAT IS SUMPTUOUS THAN SUBLIME AND UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES
6364-65388-0042 WHICH ADDRESS THEMSELVES MORE TO HIS COMFORT THAN HIS CURIOSITY THE STATUE WHICH IS TO BE PATHETIC SEEN BETWEEN THE FLASHES OF FOOTMEN'S LIVERY ROUND THE DINING TABLE MUST HAVE STRONG ELEMENTS OF PATHOS IN ITSELF AND THE STATUE WHICH IS TO BE AWFUL
6364-65388-0043 IN THE MIDST OF THE GOSSIP OF THE DRAWING ROOM MUST HAVE THE ELEMENTS OF AWE WHOLLY IN ITSELF BUT THE SPECTATOR IS BROUGHT TO YOUR WORK ALREADY IN AN EXCITED AND IMAGINATIVE MOOD
6364-65388-0044 HE HAS BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE CATHEDRAL WALL AS IT LOOMED OVER THE LOW STREETS BEFORE HE LOOKS UP TO THE CARVING OF ITS PORCH AND HIS LOVE OF MYSTERY HAS BEEN TOUCHED BY THE SILENCE AND THE SHADOWS OF THE CLOISTER
6364-65388-0045 BEFORE HE CAN SET HIMSELF TO DECIPHER THE BOSSES ON ITS VAULTING SO THAT WHEN ONCE HE BEGINS TO OBSERVE YOUR DOINGS HE WILL ASK NOTHING BETTER FROM YOU NOTHING KINDER FROM YOU THAN THAT YOU WOULD MEET THIS IMAGINATIVE TEMPER OF HIS HALF WAY
6364-65388-0046 OR CARRYING OUT YOUR FANCIES HOWEVER EXTRAVAGANT IN GROTESQUENESS OF SHADOW OR SHAPE WILL BE FOR THE MOST PART IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TEMPER OF THE OBSERVER AND HE IS LIKELY THEREFORE MUCH MORE WILLINGLY TO USE HIS FANCY TO HELP YOUR MEANINGS
6364-65388-0047 THAN HIS JUDGMENT TO DETECT YOUR FAULTS AGAIN REMEMBER THAT WHEN THE IMAGINATION AND FEELINGS ARE STRONGLY EXCITED THEY WILL NOT ONLY BEAR WITH STRANGE THINGS BUT THEY WILL LOOK INTO MINUTE THINGS WITH A DELIGHT QUITE UNKNOWN IN HOURS OF TRANQUILLITY
6364-65388-0048 YOU SURELY MUST REMEMBER MOMENTS OF YOUR LIVES IN WHICH UNDER SOME STRONG EXCITEMENT OF FEELING ALL THE DETAILS OF VISIBLE OBJECTS PRESENTED THEMSELVES WITH A STRANGE INTENSITY AND INSISTANCE WHETHER YOU WOULD OR NO
6364-65388-0049 THINGS TRIVIAL AT OTHER TIMES ASSUME A DIGNITY OR SIGNIFICANCE WHICH WE CANNOT EXPLAIN BUT WHICH IS ONLY THE MORE ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE INEXPLICABLE AND THE POWERS OF ATTENTION QUICKENED BY THE FEVERISH EXCITEMENT
6364-65388-0050 AND WHICH WOULD ASSUREDLY BE OFFENSIVE TO THE PERFECT TASTE IN ITS MOMENTS OF LANGUOR OR OF CRITICAL JUDGMENT WILL BE GRATEFUL AND EVEN SUBLIME WHEN IT MEETS THIS FRIGHTENED INQUISITIVENESS THIS FASCINATED WATCHFULNESS
6364-65388-0051 OF THE ROUSED IMAGINATION AND THIS IS ALL FOR YOUR ADVANTAGE FOR IN THE BEGINNINGS OF YOUR SCULPTURE YOU WILL ASSUREDLY FIND IT EASIER TO IMITATE MINUTE CIRCUMSTANCES OF COSTUME OR CHARACTER
6364-65388-0052 THAN TO PERFECT THE ANATOMY OF SIMPLE FORMS OR THE FLOW OF NOBLE MASSES AND IT WILL BE ENCOURAGING TO REMEMBER THAT THE GRACE YOU CANNOT PERFECT AND THE SIMPLICITY YOU CANNOT ACHIEVE
