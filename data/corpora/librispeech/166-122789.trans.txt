166-122789-0000 THOUGH IF IT WERE CONVENIENT I MIGHT PRESENT A RECORD OF IMPRESSIONS NONETHELESS DELECTABLE THAT THEY WERE NOT EXHAUSTIVELY ANALYZED MANY OF THEM STILL LINGER IN THE MINDS OF OUR TRAVELERS ATTENDED BY A TRAIN OF HARMONIOUS IMAGES
166-122789-0001 OF UNIVERSAL FRIENDLINESS AND FRANKNESS OF OCCASIONS ON WHICH THEY KNEW EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING AND HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY SENSE OF EASE
166-122789-0002 ON LONG SEA ROADS BENEATH A SKY LIGHTED UP BY MARVELOUS SUNSETS OF SUPPERS ON THE RETURN INFORMAL IRREGULAR AGREEABLE
166-122789-0003 OF EVENINGS AT OPEN WINDOWS OR ON THE PERPETUAL VERANDAS IN THE SUMMER STARLIGHT ABOVE THE WARM ATLANTIC THE YOUNG ENGLISHMEN WERE INTRODUCED TO EVERYBODY
166-122789-0004 ENTERTAINED BY EVERYBODY INTIMATE WITH EVERYBODY AT THE END OF THREE DAYS THEY HAD REMOVED THEIR LUGGAGE FROM THE HOTEL AND HAD GONE TO STAY WITH MISSUS WESTGATE
166-122789-0005 A STEP TO WHICH PERCY BEAUMONT AT FIRST OFFERED SOME CONSCIENTIOUS OPPOSITION I CALL HIS OPPOSITION CONSCIENTIOUS BECAUSE IT WAS FOUNDED UPON SOME TALK THAT HE HAD HAD ON THE SECOND DAY WITH BESSIE ALDEN
166-122789-0006 HE HAD INDEED HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TALK WITH HER FOR SHE WAS NOT LITERALLY ALWAYS IN CONVERSATION WITH LORD LAMBETH HE HAD MEDITATED UPON MISSUS WESTGATE'S ACCOUNT OF HER SISTER
166-122789-0007 AND HE DISCOVERED FOR HIMSELF THAT THE YOUNG LADY WAS CLEVER AND APPEARED TO HAVE READ A GREAT DEAL SHE SEEMED VERY NICE THOUGH HE COULD NOT MAKE OUT AS MISSUS WESTGATE HAD SAID SHE WAS SHY
166-122789-0008 IF SHE WAS SHY SHE CARRIED IT OFF VERY WELL MISTER BEAUMONT SHE HAD SAID PLEASE TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT LORD LAMBETH'S FAMILY HOW WOULD YOU SAY IT IN ENGLAND HIS POSITION
166-122789-0009 HIS POSITION PERCY BEAUMONT REPEATED HIS RANK OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVEN'T GOT A PEERAGE LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THACKERAY
166-122789-0010 THAT'S A GREAT PITY SAID BEAUMONT YOU WOULD FIND IT ALL SET FORTH THERE SO MUCH BETTER THAN I CAN DO IT HE IS A PEER THEN OH YES HE IS A PEER AND HAS HE ANY OTHER TITLE THAN LORD LAMBETH
166-122789-0011 BESSIE ALDEN APPEARED TO BE LOOKING AT HIM WITH INTEREST HE IS THE SON OF THE DUKE OF BAYSWATER HE ADDED PRESENTLY THE ELDEST SON THE ONLY SON
166-122789-0012 AND ARE HIS PARENTS LIVING OH YES IF HIS FATHER WERE NOT LIVING HE WOULD BE A DUKE
166-122789-0013 SO THAT WHEN HIS FATHER DIES PURSUED BESSIE ALDEN WITH MORE SIMPLICITY THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED IN A CLEVER GIRL HE WILL BECOME DUKE OF BAYSWATER OF COURSE SAID PERCY BEAUMONT
166-122789-0014 BUT HIS FATHER IS IN EXCELLENT HEALTH AND HIS MOTHER BEAUMONT SMILED A LITTLE THE DUCHESS IS UNCOMMONLY ROBUST AND HAS HE ANY SISTERS YES THERE ARE TWO
166-122789-0015 AND WHAT ARE THEY CALLED ONE OF THEM IS MARRIED SHE IS THE COUNTESS OF PIMLICO AND THE OTHER THE OTHER IS UNMARRIED SHE IS PLAIN LADY JULIA
166-122789-0016 BESSIE ALDEN LOOKED AT HIM A MOMENT IS SHE VERY PLAIN BEAUMONT BEGAN TO LAUGH AGAIN YOU WOULD NOT FIND HER SO HANDSOME AS HER BROTHER HE SAID
166-122789-0017 SHE HAS BEEN ASKING ME SAID BEAUMONT ALL ABOUT YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR POSSESSIONS I AM SURE IT IS VERY GOOD OF HER LORD LAMBETH REJOINED WELL THEN OBSERVED HIS COMPANION IF YOU GO YOU GO WITH YOUR EYES OPEN
166-122789-0018 DAMN MY EYES EXCLAIMED LORD LAMBETH IF ONE IS TO BE A DOZEN TIMES A DAY AT THE HOUSE IT IS A GREAT DEAL MORE CONVENIENT TO SLEEP THERE I AM SICK OF TRAVELING UP AND DOWN THIS BEASTLY AVENUE
166-122789-0019 IT WAS OBVIOUSLY THE MEMORY OF THIS PROMISE THAT MADE HIM SAY TO HIS COMPANION A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER THAT HE RATHER WONDERED HE SHOULD BE SO FOND OF THAT GIRL IN THE FIRST PLACE HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW FOND I AM OF HER ASKED LORD LAMBETH
166-122789-0020 AND IN THE SECOND PLACE WHY SHOULDN'T I BE FOND OF HER I SHOULDN'T THINK SHE WOULD BE IN YOUR LINE WHAT DO YOU CALL MY LINE YOU DON'T SET HER DOWN AS FAST EXACTLY SO
166-122789-0021 MISSUS WESTGATE TELLS ME THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE FAST GIRL IN AMERICA THAT IT'S AN ENGLISH INVENTION AND THAT THE TERM HAS NO MEANING HERE ALL THE BETTER IT'S AN ANIMAL I DETEST
166-122789-0022 YOU PREFER A BLUESTOCKING IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL MISS ALDEN HER SISTER TELLS ME SAID PERCY BEAUMONT THAT SHE IS TREMENDOUSLY LITERARY I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
166-122789-0023 AND HE HAD A STRONG INCORRUPTIBLE SENSE OF THE PROPRIETIES OF LIFE HIS KINSMAN MEANWHILE WAS HAVING A GREAT DEAL OF TALK WITH BESSIE ALDEN ON THE RED SEA ROCKS BEYOND THE LAWN
166-122789-0024 IN THE COURSE OF LONG ISLAND RIDES WITH A SLOW RETURN IN THE GLOWING TWILIGHT ON THE DEEP VERANDA LATE IN THE EVENING LORD LAMBETH WHO HAD STAYED AT MANY HOUSES
166-122789-0025 THIS YOUNG LADY NO LONGER APPLIED TO PERCY BEAUMONT FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING HIS LORDSHIP SHE ADDRESSED HERSELF DIRECTLY TO THE YOUNG NOBLEMAN SHE ASKED HIM A GREAT MANY QUESTIONS SOME OF WHICH BORED HIM A LITTLE
166-122789-0026 IS IT AN IMPORTANT POSITION SHE ASKED OH DEAR NO SAID LORD LAMBETH I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD BE VERY GRAND SAID BESSIE ALDEN TO POSSESS SIMPLY BY AN ACCIDENT OF BIRTH THE RIGHT TO MAKE LAWS FOR A GREAT NATION
166-122789-0027 FROM A HIGH POINT OF VIEW IT WOULD BE VERY INSPIRING THE LESS ONE THINKS OF IT THE BETTER LORD LAMBETH AFFIRMED I THINK IT'S TREMENDOUS SAID BESSIE ALDEN AND ON ANOTHER OCCASION SHE ASKED HIM IF HE HAD ANY TENANTRY
166-122789-0028 HEREUPON IT WAS THAT AS I HAVE SAID HE WAS A LITTLE BORED DO YOU WANT TO BUY UP THEIR LEASES HE ASKED WELL HAVE YOU GOT ANY LIVINGS SHE DEMANDED OH I SAY HE CRIED
166-122789-0029 HAVE YOU GOT A CLERGYMAN THAT IS LOOKING OUT BUT SHE MADE HIM TELL HER THAT HE HAD A CASTLE HE CONFESSED TO BUT ONE IT WAS THE PLACE IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN BORN AND BROUGHT UP
166-122789-0030 HIS WIFE MORE THAN ONCE ANNOUNCED THAT SHE EXPECTED HIM ON THE MORROW BUT ON THE MORROW SHE WANDERED ABOUT A LITTLE WITH A TELEGRAM IN HER JEWELED FINGERS DECLARING IT WAS VERY TIRESOME THAT HIS BUSINESS DETAINED HIM IN NEW YORK
166-122789-0031 AND SHE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN WHILE SHE CONTINUED THAT SLOW PACED PROMENADE WHICH ENABLED HER WELL ADJUSTED SKIRTS TO DISPLAY THEMSELVES SO ADVANTAGEOUSLY THAT UNFORTUNATELY IN AMERICA THERE WAS NO LEISURE CLASS
166-122789-0032 IT WAS LORD LAMBETH'S THEORY FREELY PROPOUNDED WHEN THE YOUNG MEN WERE TOGETHER THAT PERCY BEAUMONT WAS HAVING A VERY GOOD TIME WITH MISSUS WESTGATE AND THAT UNDER THE PRETEXT OF MEETING FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANIMATED DISCUSSION
166-122789-0033 THEY WERE INDULGING IN PRACTICES THAT IMPARTED A SHADE OF HYPOCRISY TO THE LADY'S REGRET FOR HER HUSBAND'S ABSENCE I ASSURE YOU WE ARE ALWAYS DISCUSSING AND DIFFERING SAID PERCY BEAUMONT SHE IS AWFULLY ARGUMENTATIVE
166-122789-0034 AMERICAN LADIES CERTAINLY DON'T MIND CONTRADICTING YOU UPON MY WORD I DON'T THINK I WAS EVER TREATED SO BY A WOMAN BEFORE SHE'S SO DEVILISH POSITIVE
166-122789-0035 BUT HE WAS ABSENT ONLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS DURING WHICH WITH MISTER WESTGATE'S ASSISTANCE HE COMPLETELY SETTLED THIS PIECE OF BUSINESS THEY CERTAINLY DO THINGS QUICKLY IN NEW YORK HE OBSERVED TO HIS COUSIN
166-122789-0036 AND HE ADDED THAT MISTER WESTGATE HAD SEEMED VERY UNEASY LEST HIS WIFE SHOULD MISS HER VISITOR HE HAD BEEN IN SUCH AN AWFUL HURRY TO SEND HIM BACK TO HER I'M AFRAID YOU'LL NEVER COME UP TO AN AMERICAN HUSBAND IF THAT'S WHAT THE WIVES EXPECT HE SAID TO LORD LAMBETH
166-122789-0037 MISSUS WESTGATE HOWEVER WAS NOT TO ENJOY MUCH LONGER THE ENTERTAINMENT WITH WHICH AN INDULGENT HUSBAND HAD DESIRED TO KEEP HER PROVIDED ON THE TWENTY FIRST OF AUGUST LORD LAMBETH RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM HIS MOTHER
166-122789-0038 WHAT AM I TO DO PERCY BEAUMONT WAS ANNOYED AS WELL HE HAD DEEMED IT HIS DUTY AS I HAVE NARRATED TO WRITE TO THE DUCHESS BUT HE HAD NOT EXPECTED THAT THIS DISTINGUISHED WOMAN WOULD ACT SO PROMPTLY UPON HIS HINT
166-122789-0039 IT MEANS HE SAID THAT YOUR FATHER IS LAID UP I DON'T SUPPOSE IT'S ANYTHING SERIOUS BUT YOU HAVE NO OPTION TAKE THE FIRST STEAMER BUT DON'T BE ALARMED
166-122789-0040 LORD LAMBETH MADE HIS FAREWELLS BUT THE FEW LAST WORDS THAT HE EXCHANGED WITH BESSIE ALDEN ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE A PLACE IN OUR RECORD
166-122789-0041 OF COURSE I NEEDN'T ASSURE YOU HE SAID THAT IF YOU SHOULD COME TO ENGLAND NEXT YEAR I EXPECT TO BE THE FIRST PERSON THAT YOU INFORM OF IT BESSIE ALDEN LOOKED AT HIM A LITTLE AND SHE SMILED
166-122789-0042 PERCY BEAUMONT RETURNED WITH HIS COUSIN AND HIS SENSE OF DUTY COMPELLED HIM ONE WINDLESS AFTERNOON IN MID ATLANTIC
166-122789-0043 TO SAY TO LORD LAMBETH THAT HE SUSPECTED THAT THE DUCHESS'S TELEGRAM WAS IN PART THE RESULT OF SOMETHING HE HIMSELF HAD WRITTEN TO HER I WROTE TO HER AS I EXPLICITLY NOTIFIED YOU I HAD PROMISED TO DO
166-122789-0044 BUT I HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS A REASONABLE YOUNG MAN AND I CAN GIVE NO BETTER PROOF OF IT THAN THE FACT THAT HE REMARKED TO HIS COMPANION AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR YOU WERE QUITE RIGHT AFTER ALL I AM VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN HER
166-122789-0045 ONLY TO BE FAIR HE ADDED YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD MY MOTHER ALSO THAT SHE IS NOT SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN ME PERCY BEAUMONT GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH THERE IS NOTHING SO CHARMING AS MODESTY IN A YOUNG MAN IN YOUR POSITION
