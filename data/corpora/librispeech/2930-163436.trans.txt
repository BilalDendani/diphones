2930-163436-0000 AND IT WAS SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS BEGOTTEN IN ADULTERY BY HIS FATHER IN LAW THE FOLLOWING VERSE HOWEVER WAS IMMEDIATELY IN EVERY ONE'S MOUTH
2930-163436-0001 NINE MONTHS FOR COMMON BIRTHS THE FATES DECREE
2930-163436-0002 NOR DID HE DESIST FROM PURSUING THEM UNTIL AN APPARITION IN THE FORM OF A BARBARIAN WOMAN OF MORE THAN HUMAN SIZE APPEARED TO HIM
2930-163436-0003 THESE ACHIEVEMENTS HE HAD THE HONOUR OF AN OVATION AND THE TRIUMPHAL ORNAMENTS
2930-163436-0004 AND RETURNING AGAIN TO GERMANY DIED OF DISEASE IN THE SUMMER ENCAMPMENT WHICH THENCE OBTAINED THE NAME OF THE UNLUCKY CAMP HIS CORPSE WAS CARRIED TO ROME BY THE PRINCIPAL PERSONS OF THE SEVERAL MUNICIPALITIES AND COLONIES UPON THE ROAD
2930-163436-0005 AND GAVE THE COGNOMEN OF GERMANICUS TO HIM AND HIS POSTERITY IN HIM THE CIVIL AND MILITARY VIRTUES WERE EQUALLY DISPLAYED FOR BESIDES HIS VICTORIES
2930-163436-0006 HE LIKEWISE OFTEN DECLARED THAT HE WOULD SOME TIME OR OTHER IF POSSIBLE RESTORE THE ANCIENT GOVERNMENT IN THIS ACCOUNT I SUPPOSE SOME HAVE VENTURED TO AFFIRM THAT AUGUSTUS WAS JEALOUS OF HIM AND RECALLED HIM
2930-163436-0007 AND BECAUSE HE MADE NO HASTE TO COMPLY WITH THE ORDER TOOK HIM OFF BY POISON THIS I MENTION THAT I MAY NOT BE GUILTY OF ANY OMISSION MORE THAN BECAUSE I THINK IT EITHER TRUE OR PROBABLE
2930-163436-0008 SINCE AUGUSTUS LOVED HIM SO MUCH WHEN LIVING THAT HE ALWAYS IN HIS WILLS MADE HIM JOINT HEIR WITH HIS SONS AS HE ONCE DECLARED IN THE SENATE AND UPON HIS DECEASE EXTOLLED HIM
2930-163436-0009 IN A SPEECH TO THE PEOPLE TO THAT DEGREE THAT HE PRAYED THE GODS TO MAKE HIS CAESARS LIKE HIM AND TO GRANT HIMSELF AS HONOURABLE AN EXIT OUT OF THIS WORLD AS THEY HAD GIVEN HIM AND NOT SATISFIED WITH INSCRIBING UPON HIS TOMB
2930-163436-0010 AN EPITAPH IN VERSE COMPOSED BY HIMSELF HE WROTE LIKEWISE THE HISTORY OF HIS LIFE IN PROSE HE HAD BY THE YOUNGER ANTONIA SEVERAL CHILDREN BUT LEFT BEHIND HIM ONLY THREE NAMELY GERMANICUS LIVILLA
2930-163436-0011 AND DURING ALMOST THE WHOLE OF HIS MINORITY AND FOR SOME TIME AFTER
2930-163436-0012 AND BODY BEING GREATLY IMPAIRED HE WAS EVEN AFTER HIS ARRIVAL AT YEARS OF MATURITY NEVER THOUGHT SUFFICIENTLY QUALIFIED FOR ANY PUBLIC OR PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT HE WAS THEREFORE DURING A LONG TIME AND EVEN AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF HIS MINORITY
2930-163436-0013 UNDER THE DIRECTION OF A PEDAGOGUE WHO HE COMPLAINS IN A CERTAIN MEMOIR
2930-163436-0014 ON ACCOUNT OF THIS CRAZY CONSTITUTION OF BODY AND MIND
2930-163436-0015 HE PRESIDED MUFFLED UP IN A PALLIUM A NEW FASHION WHEN HE ASSUMED THE MANLY HABIT HE WAS CARRIED IN A LITTER AT MIDNIGHT TO THE CAPITOL
2930-163436-0016 FROM AN EARLY AGE WITH GREAT ASSIDUITY TO THE STUDY OF THE LIBERAL SCIENCES AND FREQUENTLY PUBLISHED SPECIMENS OF HIS SKILL IN EACH OF THEM BUT NEVER WITH ALL HIS ENDEAVOURS COULD HE ATTAIN TO ANY PUBLIC POST IN THE GOVERNMENT
2930-163436-0017 OR AFFORD ANY HOPE OF ARRIVING AT DISTINCTION THEREAFTER HIS MOTHER ANTONIA FREQUENTLY CALLED HIM
2930-163436-0018 BUT NEVER FINISHED BY NATURE AND WHEN SHE WOULD UPBRAID ANY ONE WITH DULNESS SHE SAID HE WAS A GREATER FOOL THAN HER SON CLAUDIUS HIS GRANDMOTHER AUGUSTA ALWAYS TREATED HIM WITH THE UTMOST CONTEMPT
2930-163436-0019 IT WAS IN WRITING VERY BRIEFLY AND SEVERELY OR BY MESSENGERS HIS SISTER LIVILLA UPON HEARING THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO BE CREATED EMPEROR OPENLY AND LOUDLY EXPRESSED HER INDIGNATION
2930-163436-0020 WE ARE BOTH AGREED IN THIS THAT ONCE FOR ALL WE OUGHT TO DETERMINE WHAT COURSE TO TAKE WITH HIM
2930-163436-0021 BY THE SAME STEPS AND DEGREES WE DID HIS BROTHER BUT IF WE FIND HIM BELOW PAR AND DEFICIENT BOTH IN BODY AND MIND WE MUST BEWARE OF GIVING OCCASION FOR HIM AND OURSELVES TO BE LAUGHED AT BY THE WORLD
2930-163436-0022 WHICH IS READY ENOUGH TO MAKE SUCH THINGS THE SUBJECT OF MIRTH AND DERISION
2930-163436-0023 WITHOUT SETTLING IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
2930-163436-0024 I AM NOT AGAINST HIS SUPERINTENDING THE FEAST OF THE PRIESTS IN THE GAMES OF MARS IF HE WILL SUFFER HIMSELF TO BE GOVERNED BY HIS KINSMAN SILANUS'S SON THAT HE MAY DO NOTHING TO MAKE THE PEOPLE STARE AND LAUGH AT HIM
2930-163436-0025 IN THE VERY FRONT OF THE THEATRE
2930-163436-0026 FOR IF HE BE CAPABLE OF ATTENDING HIS BROTHER TO THE MOUNT
2930-163436-0027 THIS PART OF MY LETTER TO READ IN ANOTHER LETTER HE WRITES AS FOLLOWS I SHALL INVITE THE YOUTH TIBERIUS EVERY DAY DURING YOUR ABSENCE TO SUPPER THAT HE MAY NOT SUP ALONE WITH HIS FRIENDS SULPICIUS
2930-163436-0028 AND ATHENODORUS I WISH THE POOR CREATURE WAS MORE CAUTIOUS AND ATTENTIVE IN THE CHOICE OF SOME ONE WHOSE MANNERS AIR AND GAIT MIGHT BE PROPER FOR HIS IMITATION
2930-163436-0029 IN THINGS OF CONSEQUENCE HE SADLY FAILS WHERE HIS MIND DOES NOT RUN ASTRAY HE DISCOVERS A NOBLE DISPOSITION IN A THIRD LETTER HE SAYS LET ME DIE MY DEAR LIVIA
2930-163436-0030 IF I AM NOT ASTONISHED THAT THE DECLAMATION OF YOUR GRANDSON TIBERIUS SHOULD PLEASE ME FOR HOW HE WHO TALKS SO ILL SHOULD BE ABLE TO DECLAIM SO CLEARLY AND PROPERLY I CANNOT IMAGINE
2930-163436-0031 NAMING HIM AMONGST THE HEIRS OF THE THIRD DEGREE WHO WERE BUT DISTANTLY ALLIED TO HIS FAMILY FOR A SIXTH PART OF HIS ESTATE ONLY
2930-163436-0032 OF THE CONSULSHIP AND WHEN HE PRESSED FOR A LEGITIMATE APPOINTMENT THE EMPEROR WROTE WORD BACK THAT HE SENT HIM FORTY GOLD PIECES FOR HIS EXPENSES DURING THE FESTIVALS
2930-163436-0033 UPON THIS LAYING ASIDE ALL HOPE OF ADVANCEMENT HE RESIGNED HIMSELF ENTIRELY TO AN INDOLENT LIFE LIVING IN GREAT PRIVACY
2930-163436-0034 ANOTHER WHILE IN CAMPANIA
2930-163436-0035 BY WHICH MEANS BESIDES HIS FORMER CHARACTER OF A DULL HEAVY FELLOW HE ACQUIRED THAT OF A DRUNKARD
2930-163436-0036 MUCH RESPECT WAS SHOWN HIM BOTH IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE
2930-163436-0037 TWICE MADE CHOICE OF HIM TO INTERCEDE ON THEIR BEHALF ONCE TO OBTAIN FROM THE CONSULS THE FAVOUR OF BEARING ON THEIR SHOULDERS THE CORPSE OF AUGUSTUS TO ROME AND A SECOND TIME TO CONGRATULATE HIM UPON THE DEATH OF SEJANUS
2930-163436-0038 WHEN HE ENTERED THE THEATRE THEY USED TO RISE AND PUT OFF THEIR CLOAKS THE SENATE LIKEWISE DECREED
2930-163436-0039 LEAVING HIM BESIDES A LEGACY OF TWO MILLIONS OF SESTERCES AND EXPRESSLY RECOMMENDING HIM TO THE ARMIES
2930-163436-0040 CLAUDIUS ALSO WAS ADMITTED TO PUBLIC OFFICES AND HELD THE CONSULSHIP JOINTLY WITH HIS NEPHEW FOR TWO MONTHS
2930-163436-0041 AN EAGLE WHICH WAS FLYING THAT WAY ALIGHTED UPON HIS RIGHT SHOULDER
2930-163436-0042 HE SOMETIMES PRESIDED AT THE PUBLIC SPECTACLES AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF CAIUS
2930-163436-0043 WISHING HIM ALL HAPPINESS SOMETIMES UNDER THE TITLE OF THE EMPEROR'S UNCLE
2930-163436-0044 IF AT ANY TIME HE CAME IN LATE TO SUPPER
2930-163436-0045 THE COMPANY USED TO THROW OLIVE STONES AND DATES AT HIM AND THE BUFFOONS WHO ATTENDED WOULD WAKE HIM
2930-163436-0046 SOMETIMES THEY WOULD PUT SLIPPERS UPON HIS HANDS AS HE LAY SNORING THAT HE MIGHT UPON AWAKING
2930-163436-0047 FIRST IN HIS CONSULSHIP FOR HAVING BEEN TOO REMISS
2930-163436-0048 NERO AND DRUSUS HE WAS VERY NEAR BEING DEPRIVED OF HIS OFFICE AND AFTERWARDS HE WAS CONTINUALLY HARASSED WITH INFORMATIONS AGAINST HIM BY ONE OR OTHER
2930-163436-0049 WAS ALSO ALLOWED TO BE PROSECUTED
2930-163436-0050 AT LAST BEING OBLIGED TO PAY EIGHT MILLIONS OF SESTERCES ON ENTERING UPON A NEW OFFICE OF PRIESTHOOD HE WAS REDUCED TO SUCH STRAITS IN HIS PRIVATE AFFAIRS THAT IN ORDER TO DISCHARGE HIS BOND TO THE TREASURY HE WAS UNDER THE NECESSITY OF EXPOSING TO SALE HIS WHOLE ESTATE
2930-163436-0051 AND THE LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES HE CAME AT LAST TO THE EMPIRE
2930-163436-0052 AND DESIROUS TO DISCOVER WHO HE WAS PULLED HIM OUT WHEN IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZING HIM
2930-163436-0053 AND SALUTED HIM BY THE TITLE OF EMPEROR HE THEN CONDUCTED HIM TO HIS FELLOW SOLDIERS WHO WERE ALL IN A GREAT RAGE AND IRRESOLUTE WHAT THEY SHOULD DO THEY PUT HIM INTO A LITTER AND AS THE SLAVES OF THE PALACE HAD ALL FLED
2930-163436-0054 TOOK THEIR TURNS IN CARRYING HIM ON THEIR SHOULDERS AND BROUGHT HIM INTO THE CAMP
2930-163436-0055 FOR THE CONSULS WITH THE SENATE AND CIVIC TROOPS HAD POSSESSED THEMSELVES OF THE FORUM AND CAPITOL WITH THE DETERMINATION TO ASSERT THE PUBLIC LIBERTY AND HE BEING SENT FOR LIKEWISE BY A TRIBUNE OF THE PEOPLE TO THE SENATE HOUSE
2930-163436-0056 TO GIVE HIS ADVICE UPON THE PRESENT JUNCTURE OF AFFAIRS RETURNED ANSWER I AM UNDER CONSTRAINT AND CANNOT POSSIBLY COME THE DAY AFTERWARDS
2930-163436-0057 WHILE THE PEOPLE WHO SURROUNDED THE SENATE HOUSE SHOUTED
2930-163436-0058 AND PARDON FOR EVERY THING SAID OR DONE DURING THAT TIME AND THIS HE FAITHFULLY OBSERVED WITH THE EXCEPTION ONLY OF PUTTING TO DEATH A FEW TRIBUNES AND CENTURIONS CONCERNED IN THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST CAIUS BOTH AS AN EXAMPLE
2930-163436-0059 AND BECAUSE HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY HAD ALSO PLANNED HIS OWN DEATH
2930-163436-0060 HIS MOST SOLEMN AND USUAL OATH WAS
2930-163436-0061 DECLARING BY A PROCLAMATION THAT HE THE MORE EARNESTLY INSISTED UPON THE OBSERVATION OF HIS FATHER DRUSUS'S BIRTH DAY BECAUSE IT WAS LIKEWISE THAT OF HIS GRANDFATHER ANTONY
2930-163436-0062 HE COMPLETED THE MARBLE ARCH NEAR POMPEY'S THEATRE WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN DECREED BY THE SENATE IN HONOUR OF TIBERIUS
2930-163436-0063 YET HE FORBAD THE DAY OF HIS ASSASSINATION NOTWITHSTANDING IT WAS THAT OF HIS OWN ACCESSION TO THE EMPIRE
2930-163436-0064 HE WAS SPARING AND MODEST DECLINING THE TITLE OF EMPEROR AND REFUSING ALL EXCESSIVE HONOURS HE CELEBRATED THE MARRIAGE OF HIS DAUGHTER
2930-163436-0065 AS ONE OF THEIR ASSESSORS AND WHEN THEY GAVE PUBLIC SPECTACLES HE WOULD RISE UP WITH THE REST OF THE SPECTATORS AND SALUTE THEM BOTH BY WORDS AND GESTURES
2930-163436-0066 HE EXCUSED HIMSELF BECAUSE ON ACCOUNT OF THE CROWD HE COULD NOT HEAR THEM UNLESS THEY STOOD IN A SHORT TIME BY THIS CONDUCT HE WROUGHT HIMSELF SO MUCH INTO THE FAVOUR AND AFFECTION OF THE PUBLIC THAT WHEN UPON HIS GOING TO OSTIA
2930-163436-0067 A REPORT WAS SPREAD IN THE CITY THAT HE HAD BEEN WAY LAID AND SLAIN THE PEOPLE NEVER CEASED CURSING THE SOLDIERS FOR TRAITORS AND THE SENATE AS PARRICIDES UNTIL ONE OR TWO PERSONS AND PRESENTLY AFTER SEVERAL OTHERS WERE BROUGHT BY THE MAGISTRATES UPON THE ROSTRA
2930-163436-0068 NOT ONLY BY INDIVIDUALS SEPARATELY BUT BY A FACTION
2930-163436-0069 A LOW FELLOW WAS FOUND WITH A PONIARD ABOUT HIM NEAR HIS CHAMBER AT MIDNIGHT TWO MEN OF THE EQUESTRIAN ORDER WERE DISCOVERED WAITING FOR HIM IN THE STREETS ARMED WITH A TUCK AND A HUNTSMAN'S DAGGER ONE OF THEM INTENDING TO ATTACK HIM AS HE CAME OUT OF THE THEATRE
2930-163436-0070 AND THE OTHER AS HE WAS SACRIFICING IN THE TEMPLE OF MARS
2930-163436-0071 THE LEGIONS WHICH HE HAD SEDUCED FROM THEIR OATH OF FIDELITY RELINQUISHING THEIR PURPOSE UPON AN ALARM OCCASIONED BY ILL OMENS FOR WHEN ORDERS WERE GIVEN THEM TO MARCH TO MEET THEIR NEW EMPEROR THE EAGLES COULD NOT BE DECORATED NOR THE STANDARDS PULLED OUT OF THE GROUND
2930-163436-0072 HE CONSTANTLY ATTENDED THE COURTS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE EVEN UPON SUCH DAYS AS WERE SOLEMNLY OBSERVED AS DAYS OF REJOICING IN HIS FAMILY OR BY HIS FRIENDS
2930-163436-0073 WHO CONCEALING THE PRIVILEGE HIS CHILDREN GAVE HIM TO BE EXCUSED FROM SERVING HAD ANSWERED TO HIS NAME AS TOO EAGER FOR THE OFFICE ANOTHER WHO WAS SUMMONED BEFORE HIM IN A CAUSE OF HIS OWN
2930-163436-0074 HOW EQUITABLE A JUDGE HE WOULD PROVE IN THAT OF OTHER PERSONS A WOMAN REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE HER OWN SON AND THERE BEING NO CLEAR PROOF ON EITHER SIDE HE OBLIGED HER TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
2930-163436-0075 AGAINST THOSE WHO DID NOT WITHOUT INQUIRING WHETHER THEIR ABSENCE WAS OCCASIONED BY THEIR OWN FAULT OR BY REAL NECESSITY ON PROCLAMATION OF A MAN'S BEING CONVICTED OF FORGERY AND THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE HIS HAND CUT OFF HE INSISTED
2930-163436-0076 THAT AN EXECUTIONER SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY SENT FOR WITH A SPANISH SWORD AND A BLOCK A PERSON BEING PROSECUTED FOR FALSELY ASSUMING THE FREEDOM OF ROME AND A FRIVOLOUS DISPUTE ARISING BETWEEN THE ADVOCATES IN THE CAUSE
2930-163436-0077 OR GRECIAN DRESS TO SHOW HIS IMPARTIALITY HE COMMANDED HIM TO CHANGE HIS CLOTHES SEVERAL TIMES ACCORDING TO THE CHARACTER HE ASSUMED IN THE ACCUSATION OR DEFENCE AN ANECDOTE IS RELATED OF HIM
2930-163436-0078 AND BELIEVED TO BE TRUE THAT IN A PARTICULAR CAUSE HE DELIVERED HIS SENTENCE IN WRITING THUS
2930-163436-0079 THAT HE WAS EVERYWHERE AND OPENLY DESPISED A PERSON MAKING AN EXCUSE
2930-163436-0080 HE HAD SENT FOR FROM THE PROVINCES DECLARED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO APPEAR CONCEALING THE REASON FOR SOME TIME AT LAST AFTER SEVERAL INTERROGATORIES WERE PUT TO HIM ON THE SUBJECT HE ANSWERED THE MAN IS DEAD TO WHICH CLAUDIUS REPLIED
