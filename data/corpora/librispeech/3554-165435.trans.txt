3554-165435-0000 THE ATTENTION OF OUR READERS IS NOW TO BE DIRECTED TO THE HISTORY OF TWO FEMALE PIRATES A HISTORY WHICH IS CHIEFLY REMARKABLE FROM THE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE SOFTER SEX ASSUMING A CHARACTER PECULIARLY DISTINGUISHED FOR EVERY VICE THAT CAN DISGRACE HUMANITY
3554-165435-0001 AND AT THE SAME TIME FOR THE EXERTION OF THE MOST DARING THOUGH BRUTAL COURAGE MARY READ WAS A NATIVE OF ENGLAND BUT AT WHAT PLACE SHE WAS BORN IS NOT RECORDED HER MOTHER MARRIED A SAILOR WHEN SHE WAS VERY YOUNG WHO SOON AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE
3554-165435-0002 WENT TO SEA AND NEVER RETURNED THE FRUIT OF THAT MARRIAGE WAS A SPRIGHTLY BOY THE HUSBAND NOT RETURNING SHE AGAIN FOUND HERSELF WITH CHILD AND TO COVER HER SHAME TOOK LEAVE OF HER HUSBAND'S RELATIONS AND WENT TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY TAKING HER BOY ALONG WITH HER
3554-165435-0003 HER SON IN A SHORT TIME DIED AND SHE WAS RELIEVED FROM THE BURDEN OF HIS MAINTENANCE AND EDUCATION THE MOTHER HAD NOT RESIDED LONG IN THE COUNTRY BEFORE MARY READ THE SUBJECT OF THE PRESENT NARRATIVE WAS BORN AFTER THE BIRTH OF MARY
3554-165435-0004 HER MOTHER RESIDED IN THE COUNTRY FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS UNTIL HER MONEY WAS ALL SPENT AND HER INGENUITY WAS SET AT WORK TO CONTRIVE HOW TO OBTAIN A SUPPLY SHE KNEW THAT HER HUSBAND'S MOTHER WAS IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES AND COULD EASILY SUPPORT HER CHILD
3554-165435-0005 PROVIDED SHE COULD MAKE HER PASS FOR A BOY AND HER SON'S CHILD BUT IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPOSE UPON AN OLD EXPERIENCED MOTHER SHE HOWEVER PRESENTED MARY IN THE CHARACTER OF HER GRANDSON THE OLD WOMAN PROPOSED TO TAKE THE BOY TO LIVE WITH HER
3554-165435-0006 BUT THE MOTHER WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT PART WITH HER BOY THE GRANDMOTHER THEREFORE ALLOWED A CROWN PER WEEK FOR HIS SUPPORT THE INGENUITY OF THE MOTHER BEING SUCCESSFUL SHE REARED THE DAUGHTER AS A BOY BUT AS SHE GREW UP
3554-165435-0007 SHE INFORMED HER OF THE SECRET OF HER BIRTH IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT CONCEAL HER SEX THE GRANDMOTHER HOWEVER DYING THE SUPPORT FROM THAT QUARTER FAILED AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO HIRE HER OUT AS A FOOTBOY TO A FRENCH LADY THE STRENGTH AND MANLY DISPOSITION OF THIS SUPPOSED BOY
3554-165435-0008 INCREASED WITH HER YEARS AND LEAVING THAT SERVILE EMPLOYMENT SHE ENGAGED ON BOARD A MAN OF WAR THE VOLATILE DISPOSITION OF THE YOUTH DID NOT PERMIT HER TO REMAIN LONG IN THIS STATION AND SHE NEXT WENT INTO FLANDERS AND JOINED A REGIMENT OF FOOT AS A CADET
3554-165435-0009 YET SHE COULD NOT OBTAIN A COMMISSION
3554-165435-0010 SHE ACCORDINGLY QUITTED THAT SERVICE AND ENLISTED INTO A REGIMENT OF HORSE THERE SHE BEHAVED HERSELF SO VALIANTLY THAT SHE GAINED THE ESTEEM OF ALL HER OFFICERS IT HOWEVER HAPPENED THAT HER COMRADE WAS A HANDSOME YOUNG FLEMING
3554-165435-0011 AND SHE FELL PASSIONATELY IN LOVE WITH HIM THE VIOLENCE OF HER FEELINGS RENDERED HER NEGLIGENT OF HER DUTY AND EFFECTED SUCH A CHANGE IN HER BEHAVIOUR AS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF ALL BOTH HER COMRADE AND THE REST OF THE REGIMENT DEEMED HER MAD
3554-165435-0012 LOVE HOWEVER IS INVENTIVE AND AS THEY SLEPT IN THE SAME TENT SHE FOUND MEANS TO DISCOVER HER SEX WITHOUT ANY SEEMING DESIGN HE WAS BOTH SURPRISED AND PLEASED SUPPOSING THAT HE WOULD HAVE A MISTRESS TO HIMSELF BUT HE WAS GREATLY MISTAKEN
3554-165435-0013 AND HE FOUND THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO COURT HER FOR HIS WIFE A MUTUAL ATTACHMENT TOOK PLACE AND AS SOON AS CONVENIENT WOMEN'S CLOTHES WERE PROVIDED FOR HER AND THEY WERE PUBLICLY MARRIED
3554-165435-0014 THE SINGULARITY OF TWO TROOPERS MARRYING CAUSED A GENERAL CONVERSATION AND MANY OF THE OFFICERS HONORED THE CEREMONY WITH THEIR PRESENCE AND RESOLVED TO MAKE PRESENTS TO THE BRIDE TO PROVIDE HER WITH NECESSARIES AFTER MARRIAGE THEY WERE DESIROUS TO QUIT THE SERVICE
3554-165435-0015 AND THEIR DISCHARGE BEING EASILY OBTAINED THEY SET UP AN ORDINARY UNDER THE SIGN OF THE THREE SHOES AND SOON ACQUIRED A CONSIDERABLE RUN OF BUSINESS BUT MARY READ'S FELICITY WAS OF SHORT DURATION THE HUSBAND DIED AND PEACE BEING CONCLUDED
3554-165435-0016 HER BUSINESS DIMINISHED UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SHE AGAIN RESUMED HER MAN'S DRESS AND GOING INTO HOLLAND ENLISTED INTO A REGIMENT OF FOOT QUARTERED IN ONE OF THE FRONTIER TOWNS BUT THERE BEING NO PROSPECT OF PREFERMENT IN TIME OF PEACE
3554-165435-0017 SHE WENT ON BOARD A VESSEL BOUND FOR THE WEST INDIES DURING THE VOYAGE THE VESSEL WAS CAPTURED BY ENGLISH PIRATES AND AS MARY WAS THE ONLY ENGLISH PERSON ON BOARD THEY DETAINED HER AND HAVING PLUNDERED THE VESSEL OF WHAT THEY CHOSE ALLOWED IT TO DEPART
3554-165435-0018 MARY CONTINUED IN THAT UNLAWFUL COMMERCE FOR SOME TIME BUT THE ROYAL PARDON BEING TENDERED TO ALL THOSE IN THE WEST INDIES WHO SHOULD BEFORE A SPECIFIED DAY SURRENDER THE CREW TO WHICH SHE WAS ATTACHED AVAILED THEMSELVES OF THIS
3554-165435-0019 BUT FROM THE WANT OF THEIR USUAL SUPPLIES THEIR MONEY BECAME EXHAUSTED AND BEING INFORMED THAT CAPTAIN ROGERS IN THE ISLAND OF PROVIDENCE WAS FITTING OUT SOME VESSELS FOR PRIVATEERING MARY WITH SOME OTHERS REPAIRED TO THAT ISLAND
3554-165435-0020 TO SERVE ON BOARD HIS PRIVATEERS WE HAVE ALREADY HEARD THAT SCARCELY HAD THE SHIPS SAILED WHEN SOME OF THEIR CREWS MUTINIED AND RAN OFF WITH THE SHIPS TO PURSUE THEIR FORMER MODE OF LIFE AMONG THESE WAS MARY READ SHE INDEED FREQUENTLY DECLARED
3554-165435-0021 THAT THE LIFE OF A PIRATE WAS WHAT SHE DETESTED AND THAT SHE WAS CONSTRAINED TO IT BOTH ON THE FORMER AND PRESENT OCCASION IT WAS HOWEVER SUFFICIENTLY ASCERTAINED THAT BOTH MARY READ AND ANNE BONNEY WERE AMONG THE BRAVEST AND MOST RESOLUTE FIGHTERS OF THE WHOLE CREW
3554-165435-0022 THAT WHEN THE VESSEL WAS TAKEN THESE TWO HEROINES ALONG WITH ANOTHER OF THE PIRATES WERE THE LAST THREE UPON DECK AND THAT MARY HAVING IN VAIN ENDEAVORED TO ROUSE THE COURAGE OF THE CREW WHO HAD FLED BELOW DISCHARGED A PISTOL AMONGST THEM
3554-165435-0023 KILLING ONE AND WOUNDING ANOTHER NOR WAS MARY LESS MODEST THAN BRAVE FOR THOUGH SHE HAD REMAINED MANY YEARS IN THE CHARACTER OF A SAILOR YET NO ONE HAD DISCOVERED HER SEX
3554-165435-0024 THAT ANNE SUPPOSING HER TO BE A HANDSOME FELLOW BECAME GREATLY ENAMORED OF HER AND DISCOVERED HER SEX AND WISHES TO MARY WHO WAS THUS CONSTRAINED TO REVEAL HER SECRET TO ANNE RACKAM BEING THE PARAMOUR OF BONNEY AND OBSERVING HER PARTIALITY TOWARDS MARY
3554-165435-0025 THREATENED TO SHOOT HER LOVER SO THAT TO PREVENT ANY MISCHIEF ANNE ALSO INFORMED THE CAPTAIN OF THE SEX OF HER COMPANION RACKAM WAS ENJOINED TO SECRECY AND HERE HE BEHAVED HONORABLY BUT LOVE AGAIN ASSAILED THE CONQUERED MARY
3554-165435-0026 IT WAS USUAL WITH THE PIRATES TO RETAIN ALL THE ARTISTS WHO WERE CAPTURED IN THE TRADING VESSELS AMONG THESE WAS A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN OF ENGAGING MANNERS WHO VANQUISHED THE HEART OF MARY IN A SHORT TIME HER LOVE BECAME SO VIOLENT
3554-165435-0027 THAT SHE TOOK EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF ENJOYING HIS COMPANY AND CONVERSATION AND AFTER SHE HAD GAINED HIS FRIENDSHIP DISCOVERED HER SEX
3554-165435-0028 AND A MUTUAL FLAME BURNED IN THE HEARTS OF THESE TWO LOVERS AN OCCURRENCE SOON HAPPENED THAT PUT THE ATTACHMENT OF MARY TO A SEVERE TRIAL HER LOVER HAVING QUARRELLED WITH ONE OF THE CREW THEY AGREED TO FIGHT A DUEL ON SHORE MARY WAS ALL ANXIETY FOR THE FATE OF HER LOVER
3554-165435-0029 THAN THAT OF HER OWN BUT SHE COULD NOT ENTERTAIN THE IDEA THAT HE COULD REFUSE TO FIGHT AND SO BE ESTEEMED A COWARD ACCORDINGLY SHE QUARRELLED WITH THE MAN WHO CHALLENGED HER LOVER AND CALLED HIM TO THE FIELD TWO HOURS BEFORE HIS APPOINTMENT WITH HER LOVER
3554-165435-0030 ENGAGED HIM WITH SWORD AND PISTOL AND LAID HIM DEAD AT HER FEET THOUGH NO ESTEEM OR LOVE HAD FORMERLY EXISTED THIS ACTION WAS SUFFICIENT TO HAVE KINDLED THE MOST VIOLENT FLAME BUT THIS WAS NOT NECESSARY FOR THE LOVER'S ATTACHMENT WAS EQUAL
3554-165435-0031 IF NOT STRONGER THAN HER OWN THEY PLEDGED THEIR FAITH WHICH WAS ESTEEMED AS BINDING AS IF THE CEREMONY HAD BEEN PERFORMED BY A CLERGYMAN CAPTAIN RACKAM ONE DAY BEFORE HE KNEW THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN ASKED HER WHY SHE FOLLOWED A LINE OF LIFE THAT EXPOSED HER TO SO MUCH DANGER
3554-165435-0032 AND AT LAST TO THE CERTAINTY OF BEING HANGED SHE REPLIED THAT AS TO HANGING SHE THOUGHT IT NO GREAT HARDSHIP FOR WERE IT NOT FOR THAT EVERY COWARDLY FELLOW WOULD TURN PIRATE AND SO INFEST THE SEAS AND MEN OF COURAGE WOULD STARVE
3554-165435-0033 SHE WOULD NOT HAVE THE PUNISHMENT LESS THAN DEATH THE FEAR OF WHICH KEPT SOME DASTARDLY ROGUES HONEST THAT MANY OF THOSE WHO ARE NOW CHEATING THE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS AND OPPRESSING THEIR POOR NEIGHBORS WHO HAVE NO MONEY TO OBTAIN JUSTICE WOULD THEN ROB AT SEA
3554-165435-0034 AND THE OCEAN WOULD BE AS CROWDED WITH ROGUES AS THE LAND SO THAT NO MERCHANTS WOULD VENTURE OUT AND THE TRADE IN A LITTLE TIME WOULD NOT BE WORTH FOLLOWING
