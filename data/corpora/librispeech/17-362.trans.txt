17-362-0000 WHY DID I LIVE WHY IN THAT INSTANT DID I NOT EXTINGUISH THE SPARK OF EXISTENCE WHICH YOU HAD SO WANTONLY BESTOWED I KNOW NOT
17-362-0001 WHEN NIGHT CAME I QUITTED MY RETREAT AND WANDERED IN THE WOOD AND NOW NO LONGER RESTRAINED BY THE FEAR OF DISCOVERY I GAVE VENT TO MY ANGUISH IN FEARFUL HOWLINGS
17-362-0002 I WAS LIKE A WILD BEAST THAT HAD BROKEN THE TOILS DESTROYING THE OBJECTS THAT OBSTRUCTED ME AND RANGING THROUGH THE WOOD WITH A STAG LIKE SWIFTNESS OH WHAT A MISERABLE NIGHT I PASSED
17-362-0003 THE COLD STARS SHONE IN MOCKERY AND THE BARE TREES WAVED THEIR BRANCHES ABOVE ME NOW AND THEN THE SWEET VOICE OF A BIRD BURST FORTH AMIDST THE UNIVERSAL STILLNESS ALL
17-362-0004 SPREAD HAVOC AND DESTRUCTION AROUND ME AND THEN TO HAVE SAT DOWN AND ENJOYED THE RUIN BUT THIS WAS A LUXURY OF SENSATION THAT COULD NOT ENDURE
17-362-0005 I BECAME FATIGUED WITH EXCESS OF BODILY EXERTION AND SANK ON THE DAMP GRASS IN THE SICK IMPOTENCE OF DESPAIR THERE WAS NONE AMONG THE MYRIADS OF MEN
17-362-0006 AND SHOULD I FEEL KINDNESS TOWARDS MY ENEMIES NO FROM THAT MOMENT I DECLARED EVERLASTING WAR AGAINST THE SPECIES AND MORE THAN ALL AGAINST HIM WHO HAD FORMED ME
17-362-0007 AND SENT ME FORTH TO THIS INSUPPORTABLE MISERY THE SUN ROSE I HEARD THE VOICES OF MEN AND KNEW THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RETURN TO MY RETREAT DURING THAT DAY
17-362-0008 ACCORDINGLY I HID MYSELF IN SOME THICK UNDERWOOD DETERMINING TO DEVOTE THE ENSUING HOURS TO REFLECTION ON MY SITUATION THE PLEASANT SUNSHINE AND THE PURE AIR OF DAY RESTORED ME TO SOME DEGREE OF TRANQUILLITY
17-362-0009 AND WHEN I CONSIDERED WHAT HAD PASSED AT THE COTTAGE I COULD NOT HELP BELIEVING THAT I HAD BEEN TOO HASTY IN MY CONCLUSIONS I HAD CERTAINLY ACTED IMPRUDENTLY
17-362-0010 IT WAS APPARENT THAT MY CONVERSATION HAD INTERESTED THE FATHER IN MY BEHALF AND I WAS A FOOL IN HAVING EXPOSED MY PERSON TO THE HORROR OF HIS CHILDREN I OUGHT TO HAVE FAMILIARIZED THE OLD DE LACEY TO ME AND BY DEGREES
17-362-0011 TO HAVE DISCOVERED MYSELF TO THE REST OF HIS FAMILY WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR MY APPROACH
17-362-0012 THESE THOUGHTS CALMED ME AND IN THE AFTERNOON I SANK INTO A PROFOUND SLEEP BUT THE FEVER OF MY BLOOD DID NOT ALLOW ME TO BE VISITED BY PEACEFUL DREAMS THE HORRIBLE SCENE OF THE PRECEDING DAY WAS
17-362-0013 FOREVER ACTING BEFORE MY EYES THE FEMALES WERE FLYING AND THE ENRAGED FELIX TEARING ME FROM HIS FATHER'S FEET I AWOKE EXHAUSTED
17-362-0014 I CREPT FORTH FROM MY HIDING PLACE AND WENT IN SEARCH OF FOOD WHEN MY HUNGER WAS APPEASED I DIRECTED MY STEPS TOWARDS THE WELL KNOWN PATH THAT CONDUCTED TO THE COTTAGE ALL THERE WAS AT PEACE
17-362-0015 I TREMBLED VIOLENTLY APPREHENDING SOME DREADFUL MISFORTUNE THE INSIDE OF THE COTTAGE WAS DARK AND I HEARD NO MOTION I CANNOT DESCRIBE THE AGONY OF THIS SUSPENSE
17-362-0016 PRESENTLY TWO COUNTRYMEN PASSED BY BUT PAUSING NEAR THE COTTAGE THEY ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION USING VIOLENT GESTICULATIONS BUT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY SAID AS THEY SPOKE THE LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTRY
17-362-0017 WHICH DIFFERED FROM THAT OF MY PROTECTORS SOON AFTER HOWEVER FELIX APPROACHED WITH ANOTHER MAN I WAS SURPRISED AS I KNEW THAT HE HAD NOT QUITTED THE COTTAGE THAT MORNING
17-362-0018 AND WAITED ANXIOUSLY TO DISCOVER FROM HIS DISCOURSE THE MEANING OF THESE UNUSUAL APPEARANCES DO YOU CONSIDER SAID HIS COMPANION TO HIM THAT YOU WILL BE OBLIGED TO PAY THREE MONTHS RENT AND TO LOSE THE PRODUCE OF YOUR GARDEN
17-362-0019 I DO NOT WISH TO TAKE ANY UNFAIR ADVANTAGE AND I BEG THEREFORE THAT YOU WILL TAKE SOME DAYS TO CONSIDER OF YOUR DETERMINATION IT IS UTTERLY USELESS REPLIED FELIX WE CAN NEVER AGAIN INHABIT YOUR COTTAGE THE LIFE OF MY FATHER IS IN THE GREATEST DANGER
17-362-0020 MY WIFE AND MY SISTER WILL NEVER RECOVER FROM THEIR HORROR I ENTREAT YOU NOT TO REASON WITH ME ANY MORE TAKE POSSESSION OF YOUR TENEMENT AND LET ME FLY FROM THIS PLACE FELIX TREMBLED VIOLENTLY AS HE SAID THIS
17-362-0021 I CONTINUED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY IN MY HOVEL IN A STATE OF UTTER AND STUPID DESPAIR MY PROTECTORS HAD DEPARTED AND HAD BROKEN THE ONLY LINK THAT HELD ME TO THE WORLD
17-362-0022 FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FEELINGS OF REVENGE AND HATRED FILLED MY BOSOM AND I DID NOT STRIVE TO CONTROL THEM BUT ALLOWING MYSELF TO BE BORNE AWAY BY THE STREAM I BENT MY MIND TOWARDS INJURY AND DEATH
17-362-0023 AND A GUSH OF TEARS SOMEWHAT SOOTHED ME BUT AGAIN WHEN I REFLECTED THAT THEY HAD SPURNED AND DESERTED ME ANGER RETURNED A RAGE OF ANGER
17-362-0024 AND AFTER HAVING DESTROYED EVERY VESTIGE OF CULTIVATION IN THE GARDEN I WAITED WITH FORCED IMPATIENCE UNTIL THE MOON HAD SUNK TO COMMENCE MY OPERATIONS AS THE NIGHT ADVANCED A FIERCE WIND
17-362-0025 WAS QUICKLY ENVELOPED BY THE FLAMES WHICH CLUNG TO IT AND LICKED IT WITH THEIR FORKED AND DESTROYING TONGUES AS SOON AS I WAS CONVINCED THAT NO ASSISTANCE COULD SAVE ANY PART OF THE HABITATION I QUITTED THE SCENE
17-362-0026 HATED AND DESPISED EVERY COUNTRY MUST BE EQUALLY HORRIBLE AT LENGTH THE THOUGHT OF YOU CROSSED MY MIND I LEARNED FROM YOUR PAPERS
17-362-0027 THAT YOU WERE MY FATHER MY CREATOR AND TO WHOM COULD I APPLY WITH MORE FITNESS THAN TO HIM WHO HAD GIVEN ME LIFE AMONG THE LESSONS THAT FELIX HAD BESTOWED UPON SAFIE GEOGRAPHY HAD NOT BEEN OMITTED
17-362-0028 BUT HOW WAS I TO DIRECT MYSELF I KNEW THAT I MUST TRAVEL IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION TO REACH MY DESTINATION BUT THE SUN WAS MY ONLY GUIDE I DID NOT KNOW THE NAMES OF THE TOWNS THAT I WAS TO PASS THROUGH NOR COULD I ASK
17-362-0029 INFORMATION FROM A SINGLE HUMAN BEING BUT I DID NOT DESPAIR FROM YOU ONLY COULD I HOPE FOR SUCCOUR ALTHOUGH TOWARDS YOU I FELT NO SENTIMENT BUT THAT OF HATRED
17-362-0030 UNFEELING HEARTLESS CREATOR YOU HAD ENDOWED ME WITH PERCEPTIONS AND PASSIONS AND THEN CAST ME ABROAD AN OBJECT FOR THE SCORN AND HORROR OF MANKIND BUT ON YOU ONLY
17-362-0031 AND THE SUFFERINGS I ENDURED INTENSE IT WAS LATE IN AUTUMN WHEN I QUITTED THE DISTRICT WHERE I HAD SO LONG RESIDED I TRAVELLED ONLY AT NIGHT FEARFUL OF ENCOUNTERING THE VISAGE OF A HUMAN BEING
17-362-0032 NATURE DECAYED AROUND ME AND THE SUN BECAME HEATLESS RAIN AND SNOW POURED AROUND ME MIGHTY RIVERS WERE FROZEN THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH WAS HARD AND CHILL AND BARE
17-362-0033 AND I FOUND NO SHELTER OH EARTH HOW OFTEN DID I IMPRECATE CURSES ON THE CAUSE OF MY BEING
17-362-0034 AND ALL WITHIN ME WAS TURNED TO GALL AND BITTERNESS
17-362-0035 THE MORE DEEPLY DID I FEEL THE SPIRIT OF REVENGE ENKINDLED IN MY HEART SNOW FELL AND THE WATERS WERE HARDENED BUT I RESTED NOT
17-362-0036 NO INCIDENT OCCURRED FROM WHICH MY RAGE AND MISERY COULD NOT EXTRACT ITS FOOD BUT A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HAPPENED WHEN I ARRIVED ON THE CONFINES OF SWITZERLAND
17-362-0037 I GENERALLY RESTED DURING THE DAY AND TRAVELLED ONLY WHEN I WAS SECURED BY NIGHT FROM THE VIEW OF MAN ONE MORNING HOWEVER FINDING THAT MY PATH LAY THROUGH A DEEP WOOD I VENTURED TO CONTINUE MY JOURNEY AFTER THE SUN HAD RISEN
17-362-0038 THE DAY WHICH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST OF SPRING CHEERED EVEN ME BY THE LOVELINESS OF ITS SUNSHINE AND THE BALMINESS OF THE AIR I FELT EMOTIONS OF GENTLENESS AND PLEASURE THAT HAD LONG APPEARED DEAD
17-362-0039 REVIVE WITHIN ME HALF SURPRISED BY THE NOVELTY OF THESE SENSATIONS I ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE BORNE AWAY BY THEM AND FORGETTING MY SOLITUDE AND DEFORMITY DARED TO BE HAPPY
17-362-0040 SOFT TEARS AGAIN BEDEWED MY CHEEKS AND I EVEN RAISED MY HUMID EYES WITH THANKFULNESS TOWARDS THE BLESSED SUN WHICH BESTOWED SUCH JOY UPON ME
17-362-0041 HERE I PAUSED NOT EXACTLY KNOWING WHAT PATH TO PURSUE WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES
17-362-0042 I WAS SCARCELY HID WHEN A YOUNG GIRL CAME RUNNING TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE I WAS CONCEALED LAUGHING AS IF SHE RAN FROM SOMEONE IN SPORT
17-362-0043 I SANK TO THE GROUND AND MY INJURER WITH INCREASED SWIFTNESS ESCAPED INTO THE WOOD THIS
17-362-0044 INFLAMED BY PAIN I VOWED ETERNAL HATRED AND VENGEANCE TO ALL MANKIND BUT THE AGONY OF MY WOUND OVERCAME ME MY PULSES PAUSED AND I FAINTED
17-362-0045 I HAD NO MEANS OF EXTRACTING IT MY SUFFERINGS WERE AUGMENTED ALSO BY THE OPPRESSIVE SENSE OF THE INJUSTICE AND INGRATITUDE OF THEIR INFLICTION MY DAILY VOWS ROSE FOR REVENGE A DEEP AND DEADLY REVENGE
17-362-0046 SUCH AS WOULD ALONE COMPENSATE FOR THE OUTRAGES AND ANGUISH I HAD ENDURED AFTER SOME WEEKS MY WOUND HEALED AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEY
17-362-0047 OF PLEASURE BUT MY TOILS NOW DREW NEAR A CLOSE AND IN TWO MONTHS FROM THIS TIME I REACHED THE ENVIRONS OF GENEVA IT WAS EVENING WHEN I ARRIVED AND I RETIRED TO A HIDING PLACE AMONG THE FIELDS THAT SURROUND IT
17-362-0048 TO MEDITATE IN WHAT MANNER I SHOULD APPLY TO YOU I WAS OPPRESSED BY FATIGUE AND HUNGER AND FAR TOO UNHAPPY TO ENJOY THE GENTLE BREEZES OF EVENING OR THE PROSPECT OF THE SUN SETTING BEHIND THE STUPENDOUS MOUNTAINS OF JURA
17-362-0049 SUDDENLY AS I GAZED ON HIM AN IDEA SEIZED ME THAT THIS LITTLE CREATURE WAS UNPREJUDICED AND HAD LIVED TOO SHORT A TIME TO HAVE IMBIBED A HORROR OF DEFORMITY
17-362-0050 IF THEREFORE I COULD SEIZE HIM AND EDUCATE HIM AS MY COMPANION AND FRIEND I SHOULD NOT BE SO DESOLATE IN THIS PEOPLED EARTH URGED BY THIS IMPULSE I SEIZED ON THE BOY AS HE PASSED AND DREW HIM TOWARDS ME
17-362-0051 I DO NOT INTEND TO HURT YOU LISTEN TO ME
17-362-0052 UGLY WRETCH YOU WISH TO EAT ME AND TEAR ME TO PIECES YOU ARE AN OGRE LET ME GO OR I WILL TELL MY PAPA BOY YOU WILL NEVER SEE YOUR FATHER AGAIN YOU MUST COME WITH ME HIDEOUS MONSTER LET ME GO
17-362-0053 HE WILL PUNISH YOU YOU DARE NOT KEEP ME FRANKENSTEIN YOU BELONG THEN TO MY ENEMY TO HIM TOWARDS WHOM I HAVE SWORN ETERNAL REVENGE YOU SHALL BE MY FIRST VICTIM
17-362-0054 THE CHILD STILL STRUGGLED AND LOADED ME WITH EPITHETS WHICH CARRIED DESPAIR TO MY HEART I GRASPED HIS THROAT TO SILENCE HIM AND IN A MOMENT HE LAY DEAD AT MY FEET
17-362-0055 I GAZED ON MY VICTIM AND MY HEART SWELLED WITH EXULTATION AND HELLISH TRIUMPH CLAPPING MY HANDS I EXCLAIMED I TOO CAN CREATE DESOLATION MY ENEMY IS NOT INVULNERABLE
17-362-0056 THIS DEATH WILL CARRY DESPAIR TO HIM AND A THOUSAND OTHER MISERIES SHALL TORMENT AND DESTROY HIM AS I FIXED MY EYES ON THE CHILD I SAW SOMETHING GLITTERING ON HIS BREAST I TOOK IT
17-362-0057 IT WAS A PORTRAIT OF A MOST LOVELY WOMAN IN SPITE OF MY MALIGNITY IT SOFTENED AND ATTRACTED ME FOR A FEW MOMENTS I GAZED WITH DELIGHT ON HER DARK EYES
17-362-0058 AND HER LOVELY LIPS BUT PRESENTLY MY RAGE RETURNED I REMEMBERED THAT I WAS FOREVER DEPRIVED OF THE DELIGHTS THAT SUCH BEAUTIFUL CREATURES COULD BESTOW AND THAT SHE WHOSE RESEMBLANCE I CONTEMPLATED WOULD IN REGARDING ME
17-362-0059 TO ONE EXPRESSIVE OF DISGUST AND AFFRIGHT CAN YOU WONDER THAT SUCH THOUGHTS TRANSPORTED ME WITH RAGE I ONLY WONDER THAT AT THAT MOMENT
17-362-0060 INSTEAD OF VENTING MY SENSATIONS IN EXCLAMATIONS AND AGONY I DID NOT RUSH AMONG MANKIND AND PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT TO DESTROY THEM WHILE I WAS OVERCOME BY THESE FEELINGS I LEFT THE SPOT WHERE I HAD COMMITTED THE MURDER AND SEEKING A MORE SECLUDED HIDING PLACE
17-362-0061 I ENTERED A BARN WHICH HAD APPEARED TO ME TO BE EMPTY A WOMAN WAS SLEEPING ON SOME STRAW SHE WAS YOUNG NOT INDEED SO BEAUTIFUL AS HER WHOSE PORTRAIT I HELD
17-362-0062 BUT OF AN AGREEABLE ASPECT AND BLOOMING IN THE LOVELINESS OF YOUTH AND HEALTH HERE I THOUGHT IS ONE OF THOSE WHOSE JOY IMPARTING SMILES ARE BESTOWED ON ALL BUT ME AND THEN I BENT OVER HER AND WHISPERED
17-362-0063 MY BELOVED AWAKE THE SLEEPER STIRRED A THRILL OF TERROR RAN THROUGH ME SHOULD SHE INDEED AWAKE AND SEE ME AND CURSE ME AND DENOUNCE THE MURDERER THUS
17-362-0064 WOULD SHE ASSUREDLY ACT IF HER DARKENED EYES OPENED AND SHE BEHELD ME THE THOUGHT WAS MADNESS
17-362-0065 NOT I BUT SHE SHALL SUFFER THE MURDER I HAVE COMMITTED BECAUSE I AM FOREVER ROBBED OF ALL THAT SHE COULD GIVE ME SHE SHALL ATONE THE CRIME HAD ITS SOURCE IN HER
17-362-0066 BE HERS THE PUNISHMENT THANKS TO THE LESSONS OF FELIX AND THE SANGUINARY LAWS OF MAN I HAD LEARNED NOW TO WORK MISCHIEF I BENT OVER HER
17-362-0067 AND PLACED THE PORTRAIT SECURELY IN ONE OF THE FOLDS OF HER DRESS SHE MOVED AGAIN AND I FLED FOR SOME DAYS I HAUNTED THE SPOT WHERE THESE SCENES HAD TAKEN PLACE
17-362-0068 SOMETIMES WISHING TO SEE YOU SOMETIMES RESOLVED TO QUIT THE WORLD AND ITS MISERIES FOREVER AT LENGTH I WANDERED TOWARDS THESE MOUNTAINS AND HAVE RANGED THROUGH THEIR
17-362-0069 IMMENSE RECESSES CONSUMED BY A BURNING PASSION WHICH YOU ALONE CAN GRATIFY WE MAY NOT PART UNTIL YOU HAVE PROMISED TO COMPLY WITH MY REQUISITION I AM ALONE AND MISERABLE
17-362-0070 MAN WILL NOT ASSOCIATE WITH ME BUT ONE AS DEFORMED AND HORRIBLE AS MYSELF WOULD NOT DENY HERSELF TO ME MY COMPANION MUST BE OF THE SAME SPECIES AND HAVE THE SAME DEFECTS
