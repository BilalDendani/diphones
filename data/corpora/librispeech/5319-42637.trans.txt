5319-42637-0000 NEGRO DOMINATION IT IS CLAIMED THAT IN STATES DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES IN WHICH THE COLORED PEOPLE ARE IN THE MAJORITY THE SUPPRESSION OF THE COLORED VOTE IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT NEGRO DOMINATION
5319-42637-0001 TO PREVENT THE ASCENDENCY OF THE BLACKS OVER THE WHITES IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THIS CLAIM IS BASED UPON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IF THE BLACK VOTE WERE NOT SUPPRESSED IN ALL SUCH STATES
5319-42637-0002 DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES BLACK MEN WOULD BE SUPPORTED AND ELECTED TO OFFICE BECAUSE THEY WERE BLACK AND WHITE MEN WOULD BE OPPOSED AND DEFEATED BECAUSE THEY WERE WHITE TAKING MISSISSIPPI FOR PURPOSES OF ILLUSTRATION
5319-42637-0003 IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN THE SLIGHTEST GROUND FOR SUCH AN APPREHENSION NO COLORED MAN IN THAT STATE EVER OCCUPIED A JUDICIAL POSITION ABOVE THAT OF JUSTICE OF THE PEACE AND VERY FEW ASPIRED TO THAT POSITION
5319-42637-0004 OF SEVEN STATE OFFICERS ONLY ONE THAT OF SECRETARY OF STATE WAS FILLED BY A COLORED MAN UNTIL EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE WHEN COLORED MEN WERE ELECTED TO THREE OF THE SEVEN OFFICES LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
5319-42637-0005 OF THE TWO UNITED STATES SENATORS AND THE SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE LOWER HOUSE OF CONGRESS NOT MORE THAN ONE COLORED MAN OCCUPIED A SEAT IN EACH HOUSE AT THE SAME TIME OF THE THIRTY FIVE MEMBERS OF THE STATE SENATE
5319-42637-0006 THAT WAS ELECTED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE WAS AS FOLLOWS TOTAL MEMBERSHIP ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN REPUBLICANS SIXTY SIX DEMOCRATS FORTY NINE COLORED MEMBERS THIRTY EIGHT WHITE MEMBERS SEVENTY SEVEN
5319-42637-0007 BUT THE COLORED MEN NEVER AT ANY TIME HAD CONTROL OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT NOR OF ANY BRANCH OR DEPARTMENT THEREOF NOR EVEN THAT OF ANY COUNTY OR MUNICIPALITY OUT OF SEVENTY TWO COUNTIES IN THE STATE AT THAT TIME
5319-42637-0008 IT IS SAFE TO ASSERT THAT NOT OVER FIVE OUT OF ONE HUNDRED OF SUCH OFFICERS WERE COLORED MEN THE STATE DISTRICT COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS WERE NOT ONLY IN CONTROL OF WHITE MEN BUT WHITE MEN WHO WERE TO THE MANOR BORN
5319-42637-0009 OR WHO WERE KNOWN AS OLD CITIZENS OF THE STATE THOSE WHO HAD LIVED IN THE STATE MANY YEARS BEFORE THE WAR OF THE REBELLION THERE WAS THEREFORE NEVER A TIME WHEN THAT CLASS OF WHITE MEN KNOWN AS CARPET BAGGERS
5319-42637-0010 HAD ABSOLUTE CONTROL OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT OR THAT OF ANY DISTRICT COUNTY OR MUNICIPALITY OR ANY BRANCH OR DEPARTMENT THEREOF THERE WAS NEVER THEREFORE
5319-42637-0011 WHAT IS MEANT BY NEGRO DOMINATION THE ANSWER THAT THE AVERAGE READER WOULD GIVE TO THAT QUESTION WOULD BE THAT IT MEANS THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL DOMINATION OF THE BLACKS OVER THE WHITES BUT ACCORDING TO A HIGH DEMOCRATIC AUTHORITY
5319-42637-0012 THAT WOULD BE AN INCORRECT ANSWER THE DEFINITION GIVEN BY THAT AUTHORITY I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE IS THE CORRECT ONE THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED ONE THE AUTHORITY REFERRED TO
5319-42637-0013 IS THE LATE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI H H CHALMERS WHO IN AN ARTICLE IN THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW ABOUT MARCH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE EXPLAINED AND DEFINED
5319-42637-0014 WHAT IS MEANT OR UNDERSTOOD BY THE TERM NEGRO DOMINATION ACCORDING TO JUDGE CHALMERS DEFINITION IN ORDER TO CONSTITUTE NEGRO DOMINATION IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY FOLLOW THAT NEGROES MUST BE ELECTED TO OFFICE
5319-42637-0015 BUT THAT IN ALL ELECTIONS IN WHICH WHITE MEN MAY BE DIVIDED IF THE NEGRO VOTE SHOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY DECISIVE TO BE POTENTIAL IN DETERMINING THE RESULT THE WHITE MAN OR MEN THAT WOULD BE ELECTED THROUGH THE AID OF NEGRO VOTES
5319-42637-0016 WOULD REPRESENT NEGRO DOMINATION IN OTHER WORDS WE WOULD HAVE NEGRO DOMINATION WHENEVER THE WILL OF A MAJORITY OF THE WHITES WOULD BE DEFEATED THROUGH THE VOTES OF COLORED MEN
5319-42637-0017 BUT IN STATES DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES WHERE THEY ARE FEW IN NUMBERS IF THAT IS THE CORRECT DEFINITION OF NEGRO DOMINATION TO PREVENT WHICH THE NEGRO VOTE SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED THEN THE SUPPRESSION OF THAT VOTE IS NOT ONLY NECESSARY IN STATES
5319-42637-0018 DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES IN WHICH THE BLACKS ARE IN THE MAJORITY BUT IN EVERY STATE DISTRICT AND COUNTY IN THE UNION FOR IT WILL NOT BE DENIED THAT THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE BALLOT WHETHER THE VOTERS BE WHITE OR COLORED MALE OR FEMALE
5319-42637-0019 IS TO MAKE EACH VOTE DECISIVE AND POTENTIAL IF THE VOTE OF A COLORED MAN OR THE VOTE OF A WHITE MAN DETERMINES THE RESULT OF AN ELECTION IN WHICH HE PARTICIPATES THEN THE VERY PURPOSE FOR WHICH HE WAS GIVEN
5319-42637-0020 THE RIGHT AND PRIVILEGE WILL HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WHETHER THE RESULT AS WE UNDERSTAND IT BE WISE OR UNWISE IN THIS CONNECTION IT CANNOT AND WILL NOT BE DENIED
5319-42637-0021 THAT THE COLORED VOTE HAS BEEN DECISIVE AND POTENTIAL IN VERY MANY IMPORTANT NATIONAL AS WELL AS LOCAL AND STATE ELECTIONS FOR INSTANCE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT GENERAL GRANT THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE
5319-42637-0022 LOST THE IMPORTANT AND PIVOTAL STATE OF NEW YORK A LOSS WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN HIS DEFEAT IF THE SOUTHERN STATES THAT TOOK PART IN THAT ELECTION HAD ALL VOTED AGAINST HIM
5319-42637-0023 THAT THEY DID NOT DO SO WAS DUE TO THE VOTES OF THE COLORED MEN IN THOSE STATES THEREFORE GRANT'S FIRST ADMINISTRATION REPRESENTED NEGRO DOMINATION AGAIN IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX HAYES WAS DECLARED ELECTED PRESIDENT
5319-42637-0024 BY A MAJORITY OF ONE VOTE IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE THIS WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY THE RESULT OF THE ELECTION IN THE STATES OF LOUISIANA SOUTH CAROLINA AND FLORIDA ABOUT WHICH THERE WAS MUCH DOUBT AND CONSIDERABLE DISPUTE
5319-42637-0025 AND OVER WHICH THERE WAS A BITTER CONTROVERSY BUT FOR THE COLORED VOTE IN THOSE STATES THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO DOUBT NO DISPUTE NO CONTROVERSY THE DEFEAT OF MISTER HAYES
5319-42637-0026 THEREFORE THE HAYES ADMINISTRATION REPRESENTED NEGRO DOMINATION AGAIN IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY GENERAL GARFIELD THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT CARRIED THE STATE OF NEW YORK BY A PLURALITY OF ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND
5319-42637-0027 WITHOUT WHICH HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ELECTED IT WILL NOT BE DENIED BY THOSE WHO ARE WELL INFORMED
5319-42637-0028 AND WITH IT THE PRESIDENCY THEREFORE THE GARFIELD ARTHUR ADMINISTRATION REPRESENTED NEGRO DOMINATION AGAIN IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR MISTER CLEVELAND THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE
5319-42637-0029 THE NUMBER OF COLORED MEN THAT VOTED FOR MISTER CLEVELAND WAS FAR IN EXCESS OF THE PLURALITY BY WHICH HE CARRIED THE STATE MISTER CLEVELAND'S FIRST ADMINISTRATION THEREFORE REPRESENTED NEGRO DOMINATION
5319-42637-0030 MISTER CLEVELAND DID NOT HESITATE TO ADMIT AND APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT COLORED MEN CONTRIBUTED LARGELY TO HIS SUCCESS HENCE HE DID NOT FAIL TO GIVE THAT ELEMENT OF HIS PARTY APPROPRIATE AND SATISFACTORY OFFICIAL RECOGNITION
5319-42637-0031 AGAIN IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT GENERAL HARRISON THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARRIED THE STATE OF NEW YORK BY A PLURALITY OF ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND WHICH RESULTED IN HIS ELECTION
5319-42637-0032 WHICH HE WOULD HAVE LOST BUT FOR THE VOTES OF THE COLORED MEN IN THAT STATE THEREFORE HARRISON'S ADMINISTRATION REPRESENTED NEGRO DOMINATION THE SAME IS TRUE OF IMPORTANT ELECTIONS IN A NUMBER OF STATES
5319-42637-0033 WHAT WAS THE MOTIVE THE INCENTIVE THAT CAUSED IT IT WAS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF GOOD EFFICIENT AND CAPABLE GOVERNMENT FOR THAT WE ALREADY HAD IT WAS NOT ON ACCOUNT OF DISHONESTY
5319-42637-0034 MALADMINISTRATION MISAPPROPRIATION OF PUBLIC FUNDS FOR EVERY DOLLAR OF THE PUBLIC FUNDS HAD BEEN FAITHFULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IT WAS NOT ON ACCOUNT OF HIGH TAXES
