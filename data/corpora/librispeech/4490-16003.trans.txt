4490-16003-0000 CRACKS BENEATH THE FOUNDATION
4490-16003-0001 AND THAT THE ACCEPTANCE OF IT WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH DUTY HENCE HIS POSSESSION WAS IN GOOD FAITH NOW WE SAY IT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE LOUIS PHILIPPE BEING IN POSSESSION IN PERFECT GOOD FAITH AND THE DEMOCRACY BEING IN GOOD FAITH IN ITS ATTACK
4490-16003-0002 THE DEMOCRACY DEFENDS THE PEOPLE THE RELATIVE WHICH IS THE MONARCHY RESISTS THE ABSOLUTE WHICH IS THE REPUBLIC SOCIETY BLEEDS IN THIS CONFLICT BUT THAT WHICH CONSTITUTES ITS SUFFERING TO DAY WILL CONSTITUTE ITS SAFETY LATER ON
4490-16003-0003 IT IS INDIVISIBLE AND ALL ON ONE SIDE BUT THOSE WHO ARE IN ERROR ARE SO SINCERELY A BLIND MAN IS NO MORE A CRIMINAL THAN A VENDEAN IS A RUFFIAN
4490-16003-0004 BORN YESTERDAY IT WAS OBLIGED TO FIGHT TO DAY HARDLY INSTALLED IT WAS ALREADY EVERYWHERE CONSCIOUS OF VAGUE MOVEMENTS OF TRACTION ON THE APPARATUS OF JULY SO RECENTLY LAID AND SO LACKING IN SOLIDITY
4490-16003-0005 RESISTANCE WAS BORN ON THE MORROW PERHAPS EVEN IT WAS BORN ON THE PRECEDING EVENING FROM MONTH TO MONTH THE HOSTILITY INCREASED AND FROM BEING CONCEALED IT BECAME PATENT THE REVOLUTION OF JULY
4490-16003-0006 WHICH GAINED BUT LITTLE ACCEPTANCE OUTSIDE OF FRANCE BY KINGS HAD BEEN DIVERSELY INTERPRETED IN FRANCE AS WE HAVE SAID GOD DELIVERS OVER TO MEN HIS VISIBLE WILL IN EVENTS AN OBSCURE TEXT WRITTEN IN A MYSTERIOUS TONGUE
4490-16003-0007 THE MOST PROFOUND DECIPHER SLOWLY AND WHEN THEY ARRIVE WITH THEIR TEXT THE TASK HAS LONG BEEN COMPLETED THERE ARE ALREADY TWENTY TRANSLATIONS ON THE PUBLIC PLACE FROM EACH REMAINING SPRINGS A PARTY
4490-16003-0008 AND FROM EACH MISINTERPRETATION A FACTION AND EACH PARTY THINKS THAT IT ALONE HAS THE TRUE TEXT
4490-16003-0009 THINK THAT REVOLUTIONS HAVING SPRUNG FROM THE RIGHT TO REVOLT ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO REVOLT AGAINST THEM ERROR FOR IN THESE REVOLUTIONS THE ONE WHO REVOLTS IS NOT THE PEOPLE IT IS THE KING
4490-16003-0010 EVERY REVOLUTION BEING A NORMAL OUTCOME CONTAINS WITHIN ITSELF ITS LEGITIMACY WHICH FALSE REVOLUTIONISTS SOMETIMES DISHONOR BUT WHICH REMAINS EVEN WHEN SOILED
4490-16003-0011 WHICH SURVIVES EVEN WHEN STAINED WITH BLOOD REVOLUTIONS SPRING NOT FROM AN ACCIDENT BUT FROM NECESSITY A REVOLUTION IS A RETURN FROM THE FICTITIOUS TO THE REAL IT IS BECAUSE IT MUST BE THAT IT IS
4490-16003-0012 IN DEFAULT OF A CUIRASS IN ITS LACK OF LOGIC THEY ATTACKED THIS REVOLUTION IN ITS ROYALTY THEY SHOUTED TO IT REVOLUTION
4490-16003-0013 FACTIONS ARE BLIND MEN WHO AIM CORRECTLY THIS CRY WAS UTTERED EQUALLY BY THE REPUBLICANS BUT COMING FROM THEM THIS CRY WAS LOGICAL
4490-16003-0014 ALWAYS MUZZLED BUT ALWAYS GROWLING WAS BORN ARMED PEACE
4490-16003-0015 PHILOSOPHICAL FERMENTATION REPLIED TO DEMOCRATIC FERMENTATION THE ELECT FELT TROUBLED AS WELL AS THE MASSES IN ANOTHER MANNER BUT QUITE AS MUCH THINKERS MEDITATED WHILE THE SOIL THAT IS TO SAY THE PEOPLE
4490-16003-0016 TRAVERSED BY REVOLUTIONARY CURRENTS TREMBLED UNDER THEM WITH INDESCRIBABLY VAGUE EPILEPTIC SHOCKS THESE DREAMERS SOME ISOLATED OTHERS UNITED IN FAMILIES AND ALMOST IN COMMUNION TURNED OVER SOCIAL QUESTIONS IN A PACIFIC
4490-16003-0017 BUT PROFOUND MANNER IMPASSIVE MINERS WHO TRANQUILLY PUSHED THEIR GALLERIES INTO THE DEPTHS OF A VOLCANO HARDLY DISTURBED BY THE DULL COMMOTION AND THE FURNACES OF WHICH THEY CAUGHT GLIMPSES
4490-16003-0018 THIS TRANQUILLITY WAS NOT THE LEAST BEAUTIFUL SPECTACLE OF THIS AGITATED EPOCH THESE MEN LEFT TO POLITICAL PARTIES THE QUESTION OF RIGHTS THEY OCCUPIED THEMSELVES WITH THE QUESTION OF HAPPINESS THE WELL BEING OF MAN
4490-16003-0019 IN CIVILIZATION SUCH AS IT HAS FORMED ITSELF A LITTLE BY THE COMMAND OF GOD A GREAT DEAL BY THE AGENCY OF MAN INTERESTS COMBINE UNITE AND AMALGAMATE IN A MANNER TO FORM A VERITABLE HARD ROCK IN ACCORDANCE WITH A DYNAMIC LAW
4490-16003-0020 AND TO CAUSE IT TO SPOUT FORTH THE LIVING WATERS OF HUMAN FELICITY FROM THE QUESTION OF THE SCAFFOLD TO THE QUESTION OF WAR THEIR WORKS EMBRACED EVERYTHING
4490-16003-0021 ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT THE SOCIALISTS PROPOSED TO THEMSELVES COSMOGONIC VISIONS REVERY AND MYSTICISM BEING CAST ASIDE CAN BE REDUCED TO TWO PRINCIPAL PROBLEMS FIRST PROBLEM TO PRODUCE WEALTH
4490-16003-0022 THE DISTRIBUTION OF ENJOYMENT FROM THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF FORCES RESULTS PUBLIC POWER FROM A GOOD DISTRIBUTION OF ENJOYMENTS RESULTS INDIVIDUAL HAPPINESS
4490-16003-0023 BY A GOOD DISTRIBUTION NOT AN EQUAL BUT AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION MUST BE UNDERSTOOD FROM THESE TWO THINGS COMBINED THE PUBLIC POWER WITHOUT INDIVIDUAL HAPPINESS WITHIN RESULTS SOCIAL PROSPERITY
4490-16003-0024 SOCIAL PROSPERITY MEANS THE MAN HAPPY THE CITIZEN FREE THE NATION GREAT ENGLAND SOLVES THE FIRST OF THESE TWO PROBLEMS SHE CREATES WEALTH ADMIRABLY SHE DIVIDES IT BADLY
4490-16003-0025 THIS SOLUTION WHICH IS COMPLETE ON ONE SIDE ONLY LEADS HER FATALLY TO TWO EXTREMES MONSTROUS OPULENCE MONSTROUS WRETCHEDNESS ALL ENJOYMENTS FOR SOME ALL PRIVATIONS FOR THE REST
4490-16003-0026 THAT IS TO SAY FOR THE PEOPLE PRIVILEGE EXCEPTION MONOPOLY FEUDALISM BORN FROM TOIL ITSELF A FALSE AND DANGEROUS SITUATION WHICH SATES PUBLIC POWER OR PRIVATE MISERY
4490-16003-0027 WHICH SETS THE ROOTS OF THE STATE IN THE SUFFERINGS OF THE INDIVIDUAL A BADLY CONSTITUTED GRANDEUR IN WHICH ARE COMBINED ALL THE MATERIAL ELEMENTS AND INTO WHICH NO MORAL ELEMENT ENTERS COMMUNISM
4490-16003-0028 THEY ARE MISTAKEN THEIR DIVISION KILLS PRODUCTION EQUAL PARTITION ABOLISHES EMULATION AND CONSEQUENTLY LABOR IT IS A PARTITION MADE BY THE BUTCHER WHICH KILLS THAT WHICH IT DIVIDES
4490-16003-0029 THE TWO PROBLEMS MUST BE COMBINED AND MADE BUT ONE SOLVE ONLY THE FIRST OF THE TWO PROBLEMS YOU WILL BE VENICE YOU WILL BE ENGLAND YOU WILL HAVE LIKE VENICE AN ARTIFICIAL POWER OR LIKE ENGLAND
4490-16003-0030 A MATERIAL POWER YOU WILL BE THE WICKED RICH MAN YOU WILL DIE BY AN ACT OF VIOLENCE AS VENICE DIED OR BY BANKRUPTCY AS ENGLAND WILL FALL AND THE WORLD WILL ALLOW TO DIE AND FALL ALL THAT IS MERELY SELFISHNESS
4490-16003-0031 ALL THAT DOES NOT REPRESENT FOR THE HUMAN RACE EITHER A VIRTUE OR AN IDEA IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD HERE THAT BY THE WORDS VENICE ENGLAND WE DESIGNATE NOT THE PEOPLES BUT SOCIAL STRUCTURES
4490-16003-0032 AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE IT AND YOU WILL HAVE AT ONCE MORAL AND MATERIAL GREATNESS AND YOU WILL BE WORTHY TO CALL YOURSELF FRANCE THIS IS WHAT SOCIALISM SAID OUTSIDE AND ABOVE A FEW SECTS WHICH HAVE GONE ASTRAY
4490-16003-0033 THE UNFORESEEN NECESSITY FOR THE STATESMAN TO TAKE PHILOSOPHERS INTO ACCOUNT CONFUSED EVIDENCES OF WHICH WE CATCH A GLIMPSE A NEW SYSTEM OF POLITICS TO BE CREATED
4490-16003-0034 WHICH SHALL BE IN ACCORD WITH THE OLD WORLD WITHOUT TOO MUCH DISACCORD WITH THE NEW REVOLUTIONARY IDEAL A SITUATION IN WHICH IT BECAME NECESSARY TO USE LAFAYETTE TO DEFEND POLIGNAC
4490-16003-0035 PERHAPS AN EVENTUAL INDEFINABLE RESIGNATION BORN OF THE VAGUE ACCEPTANCE OF A SUPERIOR DEFINITIVE RIGHT HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN OF HIS RACE HIS DOMESTIC SPIRIT HIS SINCERE RESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE HIS OWN HONESTY
4490-16003-0036 PREOCCUPIED LOUIS PHILIPPE ALMOST PAINFULLY AND THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN STRONG AND COURAGEOUS AS HE WAS HE WAS OVERWHELMED BY THE DIFFICULTIES OF BEING A KING HE FELT UNDER HIS FEET A FORMIDABLE DISAGGREGATION
4490-16003-0037 PILES OF SHADOWS COVERED THE HORIZON A STRANGE SHADE GRADUALLY DRAWING NEARER EXTENDED LITTLE BY LITTLE OVER MEN OVER THINGS OVER IDEAS A SHADE WHICH CAME FROM WRATHS AND SYSTEMS
4490-16003-0038 SPIRITS TREMBLED IN THE SOCIAL ANXIETY LIKE LEAVES AT THE APPROACH OF A STORM THE ELECTRIC TENSION WAS SUCH THAT AT CERTAIN INSTANTS THE FIRST COMER A STRANGER BROUGHT LIGHT THEN THE TWILIGHT OBSCURITY CLOSED IN AGAIN
4490-16003-0039 AT INTERVALS DEEP AND DULL MUTTERINGS ALLOWED A JUDGMENT TO BE FORMED AS TO THE QUANTITY OF THUNDER CONTAINED BY THE CLOUD TWENTY MONTHS HAD BARELY ELAPSED SINCE THE REVOLUTION OF JULY THE YEAR EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO
4490-16003-0040 BELGIUM OFFERING HERSELF TO A FRENCH PRINCE AND GIVING HERSELF TO AN ENGLISH PRINCE THE RUSSIAN HATRED OF NICOLAS BEHIND US THE DEMONS OF THE SOUTH FERDINAND IN SPAIN MIGUEL IN PORTUGAL THE EARTH QUAKING IN ITALY
4490-16003-0041 THE PEERAGE SHELTERING ITSELF BEHIND BECCARIA TO REFUSE FOUR HEADS TO THE LAW
4490-16003-0042 THE CROSS TORN FROM NOTRE DAME LAFAYETTE LESSENED LAFFITTE RUINED BENJAMIN CONSTANT DEAD IN INDIGENCE CASIMIR PERIER DEAD IN THE EXHAUSTION OF HIS POWER
4490-16003-0043 POLITICAL AND SOCIAL MALADY BREAKING OUT SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE TWO CAPITALS OF THE KINGDOM THE ONE IN THE CITY OF THOUGHT THE OTHER IN THE CITY OF TOIL AT PARIS CIVIL WAR AT LYONS SERVILE WAR IN THE TWO CITIES
4490-16003-0044 THE SAME GLARE OF THE FURNACE A CRATER LIKE CRIMSON ON THE BROW OF THE PEOPLE THE SOUTH RENDERED FANATIC THE WEST TROUBLED THE DUCHESSE DE BERRY IN LA VENDEE PLOTS CONSPIRACIES
