8118-114469-0000 THE COTTAGES WERE PREPARED FOR THE HIGHER OFFICERS BUT THE MEN STACKED ARMS IN THE OPEN GROUND ALL ABOUT AS WELL AS THEY COULD JUDGE BY THE LIGHT OF THE LOW FIRES SOLDIERS WERE STILL CROSSING THE RIVER TO STRENGTHEN THE FORCE ALREADY ON THE UNION SIDE COLONEL WINCHESTER SUPPRESSED A GROAN
8118-114469-0001 DICK NOTICED THAT HIS FACE WAS PALLID IN THE UNCERTAIN SHADOWS AND HE UNDERSTOOD THE AGONY OF SPIRIT THAT THE BRAVE MAN MUST SUFFER WHEN HE SAW THAT THEY HAD BEEN OUTFLANKED BY THEIR ENEMY SERGEANT WHITLEY MOVING FORWARD A LITTLE TOUCHED THE COLONEL ON THE ARM
8118-114469-0002 ALL THE CLOUDS THAT WE SAW A LITTLE FURTHER BACK HE SAID HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER AN THE STORM IS ABOUT TO BUST SEE SIR HOW FAST THE JOHNNIES ARE SPREADIN THEIR TENTS AN RUNNIN TO SHELTER IT'S SO SERGEANT SAID COLONEL WINCHESTER
8118-114469-0003 I WAS SO MUCH ABSORBED IN WATCHING THOSE MEN THAT I THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH ANYWAY AND WE'D BETTER GET BACK AS FAST AS WE CAN
8118-114469-0004 THE LAST STAR WAS GONE AND THE SOMBER CLOUDS COVERED THE WHOLE HEAVENS THE WIND CEASED TO MOAN AND THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH APPREHENSION DEEP AND SULLEN THUNDER BEGAN TO MUTTER ON THE SOUTHWESTERN HORIZON
8118-114469-0005 THEN CAME A MIGHTY CRASH AND A GREAT BLAZE OF LIGHTNING SEEMED TO CLEAVE THE SKY STRAIGHT DOWN THE CENTER THE LIGHTNING AND THUNDER MADE DICK JUMP AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS BLINDED BY THE ELECTRIC GLARE HE HEARD A HEAVY SOUND OF SOMETHING FALLING AND EXCLAIMED ARE ANY OF YOU HURT
8118-114469-0006 NO SAID WARNER WHO ALONE HEARD HIM BUT WE'RE SCARED HALF TO DEATH WHEN A DROUGHT BREAKS UP I WISH IT WOULDN'T BREAK UP WITH SUCH A TERRIBLE FUSS LISTEN TO THAT THUNDER AGAIN WON'T YOU THERE WAS ANOTHER TERRIBLE CRASH OF THUNDER AND THE WHOLE SKY BLAZED WITH LIGHTNING
8118-114469-0007 DESPITE HIMSELF DICK SHRANK AGAIN THE FIRST BOLT HAD STRUCK A TREE WHICH HAD FALLEN WITHIN THIRTY FEET OF THEM BUT THE SECOND LEFT THIS BIT OF THE WOODS UNSCATHED
8118-114469-0008 THE CESSATION OF THE LIGHTNING WAS SUCCEEDED BY PITCHY DARKNESS AND THE ROARING OF THE WIND AND RAIN WAS SO GREAT THAT THEY CALLED LOUDLY TO ONE ANOTHER LEST THEY LOSE TOUCH IN THE BLACKNESS DICK HEARD WARNER ON HIS RIGHT AND HE FOLLOWED THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE BUT BEFORE HE WENT MUCH FURTHER
8118-114469-0009 HIS FOOT STRUCK A TRAILING VINE AND HE FELL SO HARD HIS HEAD STRIKING THE TRUNK OF A TREE THAT HE LAY UNCONSCIOUS THE COLD RAIN DROVE SO FIERCELY ON THE FALLEN BOY'S FACE AND BODY THAT HE REVIVED IN TWO OR THREE MINUTES AND STOOD UP
8118-114469-0010 HE CLAPPED HIS HAND TO THE LEFT SIDE OF HIS HEAD AND FELT THERE A BIG BUMP AND A SHARP ACHE HIS WEAPONS WERE STILL IN HIS BELT AND HE KNEW THAT HIS INJURIES WERE NOT SERIOUS BUT HE HEARD NOTHING SAVE THE DRIVE AND ROAR OF THE WIND AND RAIN THERE WAS NO CALLING OF VOICES AND NO BEAT OF FOOTSTEPS
8118-114469-0011 HE DIVINED AT ONCE THAT HIS COMRADES WHOLLY UNAWARE OF HIS FALL WHEN NO ONE COULD EITHER SEE OR HEAR IT HAD GONE ON WITHOUT MISSING HIM THEY MIGHT ALSO MOUNT THEIR HORSES AND GALLOP AWAY WHOLLY IGNORANT THAT HE WAS NOT AMONG THEM
8118-114469-0012 IN WHICH THEY HAD HITCHED THEIR HORSES ALL WERE GONE INCLUDING HIS OWN MOUNT AND HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT THE HORSE HAD BROKEN OR SLIPPED THE BRIDLE IN THE DARKNESS AND FOLLOWED THE OTHERS HE STOOD A WHILE BEHIND THE TRUNK OF A GREAT TREE TRYING TO SHELTER HIMSELF A LITTLE FROM THE RAIN AND LISTENED
8118-114469-0013 BUT HE COULD HEAR NEITHER HIS FRIENDS LEAVING NOR ANY FOES APPROACHING THE STORM WAS OF UNCOMMON FURY HE HAD NEVER SEEN ONE FIERCER AND KNOWING THAT HE HAD LITTLE TO DREAD FROM THE SOUTHERNERS WHILE IT RAGED HE KNEW ALSO THAT HE MUST MAKE HIS WAY ON FOOT AND AS BEST HE COULD
8118-114469-0014 TO HIS OWN PEOPLE MAKING A CALCULATION OF THE DIRECTION AND REMEMBERING THAT ONE MIGHT WANDER IN A CURVE IN THE DARKNESS HE SET OFF DOWN THE STREAM HE MEANT TO KEEP CLOSE TO THE BANKS OF THE RAPPAHANNOCK AND IF HE PERSISTED HE WOULD SURELY COME IN TIME TO POPE'S ARMY THE RAIN DID NOT ABATE
8118-114469-0015 BOTH ARMIES WERE FLOODED THAT NIGHT BUT THEY COULD FIND SOME MEASURE OF PROTECTION TO THE SCOUTS AND SKIRMISHERS AND TO DICK WANDERING THROUGH THE FOREST NATURE WAS AN UNMITIGATED FOE BUT NOTHING COULD STOP THE BOY
8118-114469-0016 HE WAS RESOLVED TO GET BACK TO THE ARMY WITH THE NEWS THAT A HEAVY SOUTHERN FORCE WAS ACROSS THE RAPPAHANNOCK OTHERS MIGHT GET THERE FIRST WITH THE FACT BUT ONE NEVER KNEW A HUNDRED MIGHT FALL BY THE WAYSIDE LEAVING IT TO HIM ALONE TO BEAR THE MESSAGE HE STUMBLED ON
8118-114469-0017 HE WAS ABLE TO KEEP HIS CARTRIDGES DRY IN HIS POUCH BUT THAT WAS ALL HIS WET COLD CLOTHES FLAPPED AROUND HIM AND HE SHIVERED TO THE BONE HE COULD SEE ONLY THE LOOM OF THE BLACK FOREST BEFORE HIM AND SOMETIMES HE SLIPPED TO THE WAIST IN SWOLLEN BROOKS
8118-114469-0018 THEN THE WIND SHIFTED AND DROVE THE SHEETS OF RAIN SPRINKLED WITH HAIL DIRECTLY IN HIS FACE HE WAS COMPELLED TO STOP A WHILE AND TAKE REFUGE BEHIND A BIG OAK WHILE HE SHIVERED IN THE SHELTER OF THE TREE THE ONLY THINGS THAT HE THOUGHT OF SPONTANEOUSLY WERE DRY CLOTHES HOT FOOD A FIRE AND A WARM BED
8118-114469-0019 THE UNION AND ITS FATE GIGANTIC AS THEY WERE SLIPPED AWAY FROM HIS MIND AND IT TOOK AN EFFORT OF THE WILL TO BRING THEM BACK BUT HIS WILL MADE THE EFFORT AND RECALLING HIS MISSION HE STRUGGLED ON AGAIN HE HAD THE RIVER ON HIS RIGHT AND IT NOW BECAME AN UNFAILING GUIDE
8118-114469-0020 IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN RAINING MUCH EARLIER IN THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE HEADWATERS AND THE FLOOD WAS ALREADY POURING DOWN THE RIVER SWISHED HIGH AGAINST ITS BANKS AND ONCE OR TWICE WHEN HE CAUGHT DIM GLIMPSES OF IT THROUGH THE TREES HE SAW A YELLOW TORRENT BEARING MUCH BRUSHWOOD UPON ITS BOSOM
8118-114469-0021 HE HAD VERY LITTLE IDEA OF HIS PROGRESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO JUDGE OF PACE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE ARMY MIGHT BE TEN MILES FURTHER ON OR IT MIGHT BE ONLY TWO THEN HE FOUND HIMSELF SLIDING DOWN A MUDDY AND SLIPPERY BANK
8118-114469-0022 THEN HE SHOT INTO A CREEK SWOLLEN BY THE FLOOD AND WENT OVER HIS HEAD HE CAME UP GASPING STRUCK OUT AND REACHED THE FURTHER SHORE HERE HE FOUND BUSHES MORE FRIENDLY THAN THE OTHERS AND PULLED HIMSELF UPON THE BANK BUT HE HAD LOST EVERYTHING
8118-114469-0023 HIS BELT HAD BROKEN IN HIS STRUGGLES AND PISTOLS SMALL SWORD AND AMMUNITION WERE GONE HE WOULD BE HELPLESS AGAINST AN ENEMY THEN HE LAUGHED AT THE IDEA SURELY ENEMIES WOULD NOT BE IN SEARCH OF HIM AT SUCH A TIME AND SUCH A PLACE
8118-114469-0024 NEVERTHELESS WHEN HE SAW AN OPEN SPACE IN FRONT OF HIM HE PAUSED AT ITS EDGE HE COULD SEE WELL ENOUGH HERE TO NOTICE A FILE OF DIM FIGURES RIDING SLOWLY BY AT FIRST HIS HEART LEAPED UP WITH THE BELIEF THAT THEY WERE COLONEL WINCHESTER AND HIS OWN PEOPLE BUT THEY WERE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
8118-114469-0025 AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO DISCERN THE BEDRAGGLED AND FADED CONFEDERATE GRAY THE HORSEMEN WERE ABOUT FIFTY IN NUMBER AND MOST OF THEM RODE WITH THE REINS HANGING LOOSE ON THEIR HORSES NECKS THEY WERE WRAPPED IN CLOAKS BUT CLOAKS AND UNIFORMS ALIKE WERE SODDEN
8118-114469-0026 A STREAM OF WATER RAN FROM EVERY STIRRUP TO THE GROUND DICK LOOKED AT THEM ATTENTIVELY NEAR THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN BUT ON ONE SIDE RODE A SOLDIERLY FIGURE APPARENTLY THAT OF A YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY THREE OR FOUR
8118-114469-0027 JUST BEHIND CAME THREE YOUTHS AND DICK'S HEART FAIRLY LEAPED WHEN HE SAW THE LAST OF THE THREE HE COULD NOT MISTAKE THE FIGURE AND A TURNING OF THE HEAD CAUSED HIM TO CATCH A FAINT GLIMPSE OF THE FACE THEN HE KNEW BEYOND ALL SHADOW OF DOUBT IT WAS HARRY
8118-114469-0028 AND HE SURMISED THAT THE OTHER TWO WERE HIS COMRADES SAINT CLAIR AND LANGDON WHOM HE HAD MET WHEN THEY WERE BURYING THE DEAD DICK WAS SO SODDEN AND COLD AND WRETCHED THAT HE WAS TEMPTED TO CALL OUT TO THEM THE SIGHT OF HARRY WAS LIKE A LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS
8118-114469-0029 BUT THE TEMPTATION WAS GONE IN AN INSTANT HIS WAY LAY IN ANOTHER DIRECTION WHAT THEY WISHED HE DID NOT WISH AND WHILE THEY FOUGHT FOR THE TRIUMPH OF THE SOUTH IT WAS HIS BUSINESS TO ENDURE AND STRUGGLE ON THAT HE MIGHT DO HIS OWN LITTLE PART FOR THE UNION
8118-114469-0030 BUT DESPITE THE STORM AND HIS SUFFERINGS HE DREW COURAGE FROM NATURE ITSELF WHILE A PORTION OF THE SOUTHERN ARMY WAS ACROSS IT MUST BE A MINOR PORTION AND CERTAINLY THE MAJOR PART COULD NOT SPAN SUCH A FLOOD AND ATTACK THE STORM AND TIME ALLIED WERE NOW FIGHTING FOR POPE
8118-114469-0031 HE WANDERED AWAY A LITTLE INTO THE OPEN FIELDS IN ORDER TO FIND EASIER GOING BUT HE CAME BACK PRESENTLY TO THE FOREST LINING THE BANK OF THE RIVER FOR FEAR HE SHOULD LOSE HIS DIRECTION THE YELLOW TORRENT OF THE RAPPAHANNOCK WAS NOW HIS ONLY SURE GUIDE AND HE STUCK TO IT
8118-114469-0032 A MILE OR TWO FURTHER AND IN THE SWISH OF THE STORM HE HEARD HOOFBEATS AGAIN LOOKING FORTH FROM THE BUSHES HE SAW ANOTHER LINE OF HORSEMEN BUT NOW THEY WERE GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF POPE'S ARMY DICK RECOGNIZED THESE FIGURES SHAPELESS AS HE MIGHT APPEAR ON HIS HORSE THAT WAS COLONEL WINCHESTER
8118-114469-0033 AND THERE WERE THE BROAD SHOULDERS OF SERGEANT WHITLEY AND THE FIGURES OF THE OTHERS HE RUSHED THROUGH THE DRIPPING FOREST AND SHOUTED IN A TONE THAT COULD BE HEARD ABOVE THE SHRIEK OF WIND AND RAIN COLONEL WINCHESTER RECOGNIZED THE VOICE BUT THE LIGHT WAS SO DIM THAT HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIM FROM WHOM IT CAME
8118-114469-0034 CERTAINLY THE FIGURE THAT EMERGED FROM THE FOREST DID NOT LOOK HUMAN COLONEL CRIED DICK IT IS I RICHARD MASON WHOM YOU LEFT BEHIND SO IT IS SAID SERGEANT WHITLEY KEENER OF EYE THAN THE OTHERS
8118-114469-0035 BUT HERE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE NEARLY DEAD JUMP UP BEHIND ME DICK MADE AN EFFORT BUT HIS STRENGTH FAILED AND HE SLIPPED BACK TO THE GROUND HE HAD NOT REALIZED THAT HE WAS WALKING ON HIS SPIRIT AND COURAGE AND THAT HIS STRENGTH WAS GONE SO POWERFUL HAD BEEN THE BUFFETS OF THE WIND AND RAIN
8118-114469-0036 AND WITH A SECOND EFFORT DICK LANDED ASTRIDE THE HORSE BEHIND THE RIDER THEN COLONEL WINCHESTER GAVE THE WORD AND THE SODDEN FILE WOUND ON AGAIN
8118-114469-0037 IT'S LUCKY WE FOUND YOU IT IS SIR AND I NOT ONLY LOOK LIKE A WRECK BUT I FEEL LIKE ONE BUT I HAD MADE UP MY MIND TO REACH GENERAL POPE'S CAMP WITH THE NEWS OF THE CONFEDERATES CROSSING AND I THINK I'D HAVE DONE IT I KNOW YOU WOULD BUT WHAT A NIGHT WHAT A NIGHT
8118-114469-0038 NOT MANY MEN CAN BE ABROAD AT SUCH A TIME WE HAVE SEEN NOTHING BUT I HAVE SIR YOU HAVE WHAT DID YOU SEE A MILE OR TWO BACK I PASSED A LINE OF SOUTHERN HORSEMEN JUST AS WET AND BEDRAGGLED AS OURS
8118-114469-0039 MIGHT THEY NOT HAVE BEEN OUR OWN MEN IT WOULD BE HARD TO TELL BLUE AND GRAY APART ON SUCH A NIGHT ONE COULD MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE BUT IN THIS CASE IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE I SAW MY OWN COUSIN HARRY KENTON RIDING WITH THEM I RECOGNIZED THEM PERFECTLY
8118-114469-0040 THEN THAT SETTLES IT THE CONFEDERATE SCOUTS AND CAVALRY ARE ABROAD TO NIGHT ALSO AND ON OUR SIDE OF THE RIVER BUT THEY MUST BE FEW WHO DARE TO RIDE IN SUCH A STORM THAT'S SURELY TRUE SIR BUT BOTH DICK AND HIS COMMANDING OFFICER WERE MISTAKEN
8118-114469-0041 NO OTHER COUNTRY WITH SO SMALL A POPULATION HAS PRODUCED IN SO SHORT A TIME EARLIER IN THE DAY STUART FULL OF ENTERPRISE AND ALMOST INSENSIBLE TO FATIGUE HAD CROSSED THE RAPPAHANNOCK MUCH HIGHER UP AND AT THE HEAD OF A FORMIDABLE BODY OF HIS HORSEMEN
8118-114469-0042 UNSEEN BY SCOUTS AND SPIES WAS RIDING AROUND THE UNION RIGHT THEY GALLOPED INTO WARRENTON WHERE THE PEOPLE RED HOT AS USUAL FOR THE SOUTH CROWDED AROUND THEM CHEERING AND LAUGHING AND MANY OF THE WOMEN CRYING WITH JOY
8118-114469-0043 IT WAS LIKE JACKSON AND STUART TO DROP FROM THE CLOUDS THIS WAY AND TO TELL THEM ALTHOUGH THE LAND HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BY THE ENEMY THAT THEIR BRAVE SOLDIERS WOULD COME IN TIME NEWS WHERE A NORTHERN FORCE COULD NOT HAVE OBTAINED A WORD WAS POURED OUT FOR THE SOUTH
8118-114469-0044 THEY TOLD STUART THAT NONE OF THE NORTHERN CAVALRY WAS ABOUT
