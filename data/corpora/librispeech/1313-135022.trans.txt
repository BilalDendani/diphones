1313-135022-0000 THE OFFICERS THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE TURNED A CORNER SO THEY KEPT ON THEIR WAY AND ALL OF THEM LIKEWISE DISAPPEARED ONE AFTER ANOTHER QUEEN ANN WAS RATHER SURPRISED AT THIS AND IN HASTENING FORWARD TO LEARN THE REASON SHE ALSO VANISHED FROM SIGHT
1313-135022-0001 AND HELD ON FOR DEAR LIFE ALL AROUND WAS DARKNESS AND THEY WERE NOT FALLING DIRECTLY DOWNWARD BUT SEEMED TO BE SLIDING ALONG A STEEP INCLINE HANK'S HOOFS WERE RESTING UPON SOME SMOOTH SUBSTANCE OVER WHICH HE SLID WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF THE WIND
1313-135022-0002 ONCE BETSY'S HEELS FLEW UP AND STRUCK A SIMILAR SUBSTANCE OVERHEAD THEY WERE INDEED DESCENDING THE HOLLOW TUBE THAT LED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD STOP HANK STOP CRIED THE GIRL
1313-135022-0003 BUT HANK ONLY UTTERED A PLAINTIVE HEE HAW FOR IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO OBEY AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES HAD PASSED AND NO HARM HAD BEFALLEN THEM BETSY GAINED COURAGE SHE COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL
1313-135022-0004 THERE WAS TIK TOK FLAT UPON HIS BACK AND SLIDING HEADFOREMOST DOWN THE INCLINE AND THERE WERE THE OFFICERS OF THE ARMY OF OOGABOO ALL TANGLED UP IN A CONFUSED CROWD FLAPPING THEIR ARMS AND TRYING TO SHIELD THEIR FACES FROM THE CLANKING SWORDS
1313-135022-0005 WHICH SWUNG BACK AND FORTH DURING THE SWIFT JOURNEY AND POMMELED EVERYONE WITHIN THEIR REACH NOW FOLLOWED QUEEN ANN WHO HAD STRUCK THE TUBE IN A SITTING POSITION AND WENT FLYING ALONG WITH A DASH AND ABANDON THAT THOROUGHLY BEWILDERED THE POOR LADY
1313-135022-0006 WHO HAD NO IDEA WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER THEN A LITTLE DISTANCE AWAY BUT UNSEEN BY THE OTHERS IN THE INKY DARKNESS SLID BETSY AND HANK WHILE BEHIND THEM WERE SHAGGY AND POLYCHROME AND FINALLY FILES AND THE PRINCESS
1313-135022-0007 WHEN FIRST THEY TUMBLED INTO THE TUBE ALL WERE TOO DAZED TO THINK CLEARLY BUT THE TRIP WAS A LONG ONE BECAUSE THE CAVITY LED STRAIGHT THROUGH THE EARTH TO A PLACE JUST OPPOSITE THE NOME KING'S DOMINIONS AND LONG BEFORE THE ADVENTURERS GOT TO THE END
1313-135022-0008 THEY HAD BEGUN TO RECOVER THEIR WITS THIS IS AWFUL HANK CRIED BETSY IN A LOUD VOICE AND QUEEN ANN HEARD HER AND CALLED OUT
1313-135022-0009 HOW COULD ANYONE BE SAFE WHEN SHE'S GOING ABOUT SIXTY MILES A MINUTE THEN AFTER A PAUSE SHE ADDED BUT WHERE DO YOU S'POSE WE'RE GOING TO YOUR MAJ'STY DON'T ASK HER THAT PLEASE DON'T SAID SHAGGY WHO WAS NOT TOO FAR AWAY TO OVERHEAR THEM
1313-135022-0010 AND PLEASE DON'T ASK ME WHY EITHER WHY SAID BETSY NO ONE CAN TELL WHERE WE ARE GOING UNTIL WE GET THERE REPLIED SHAGGY AND THEN HE YELLED OUCH FOR POLYCHROME HAD OVERTAKEN HIM AND WAS NOW SITTING ON HIS HEAD
1313-135022-0011 THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER LAUGHED MERRILY AND SO INFECTIOUS WAS THIS JOYOUS LAUGH THAT BETSY ECHOED IT
1313-135022-0012 IN A MILD AND SYMPATHETIC TONE OF VOICE
1313-135022-0013 EXCLAIMED THE LITTLE GIRL BE PATIENT AND YOU'LL FIND OUT MY DEAR SAID POLYCHROME BUT ISN'T THIS AN ODD EXPERIENCE HERE AM I WHOSE HOME IS IN THE SKIES MAKING A JOURNEY THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE EARTH
1313-135022-0014 WHERE I NEVER EXPECTED TO BE HOW DO YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THE CENTER OF THE EARTH ASKED BETSY HER VOICE TREMBLING A LITTLE THROUGH NERVOUSNESS WHY
1313-135022-0015 REPLIED POLYCHROME I HAVE OFTEN HEARD OF THIS PASSAGE WHICH WAS ONCE BUILT BY A MAGICIAN WHO WAS A GREAT TRAVELER HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SAVE HIM THE BOTHER OF GOING AROUND THE EARTH'S SURFACE BUT HE TUMBLED THROUGH THE TUBE SO FAST
1313-135022-0016 I BELIEVE THE MAGICIAN WAS GOING THE OTHER WAY AND PROBABLY HE WENT MUCH FASTER THAN WE ARE GOING IT'S FAST ENOUGH TO SUIT ME REMARKED SHAGGY GENTLY REMOVING POLYCHROME'S HEEL FROM HIS LEFT EYE
1313-135022-0017 COULDN'T YOU MANAGE TO FALL ALL BY YOURSELF MY DEAR I'LL TRY LAUGHED THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER ALL THIS TIME THEY WERE SWIFTLY FALLING THROUGH THE TUBE AND IT WAS NOT SO EASY FOR THEM TO TALK AS YOU MAY IMAGINE WHEN YOU READ THEIR WORDS
1313-135022-0018 BUT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SO HELPLESS AND ALTOGETHER IN THE DARK AS TO THEIR FATE THE FACT THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO CONVERSE AT ALL CHEERED THEM CONSIDERABLY
1313-135022-0019 AND FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR THEY CONTINUED THEIR FEARFUL JOURNEY THEN JUST AS THEY BEGAN TO FEAR THE TUBE WOULD NEVER END TIK TOK POPPED OUT INTO BROAD DAYLIGHT AND AFTER MAKING A GRACEFUL CIRCLE IN THE AIR FELL WITH A SPLASH INTO A GREAT MARBLE FOUNTAIN
1313-135022-0020 WHAT CAN ALL THIS MEAN FOR ANSWER QUEEN ANN SAILED UP FROM THE TUBE TOOK A RIDE THROUGH THE AIR AS HIGH AS THE TREETOPS AND ALIGHTED SQUARELY ON TOP OF THE PECULIAR PERSON'S HEAD SMASHING A JEWELED CROWN OVER HIS EYES AND TUMBLING HIM TO THE GROUND
1313-135022-0021 THE MULE WAS HEAVIER AND HAD BETSY CLINGING TO HIS BACK SO HE DID NOT GO SO HIGH UP FORTUNATELY FOR HIS LITTLE RIDER HE STRUCK THE GROUND UPON HIS FOUR FEET BETSY WAS JARRED A TRIFLE BUT NOT HURT
1313-135022-0022 AND WHEN SHE LOOKED AROUND HER SHE SAW THE QUEEN AND THE PECULIAR PERSON STRUGGLING TOGETHER UPON THE GROUND WHERE THE MAN WAS TRYING TO CHOKE ANN AND SHE HAD BOTH HANDS IN HIS BUSHY HAIR AND WAS PULLING WITH ALL HER MIGHT SOME OF THE OFFICERS WHEN THEY GOT UPON THEIR FEET
1313-135022-0023 SO THAT HE COULD NOT ATTACK THEIR QUEEN AGAIN BY THIS TIME SHAGGY POLYCHROME
1313-135022-0024 AND WERE CURIOUSLY EXAMINING THE STRANGE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES
1313-135022-0025 IT WAS A LOVELY PLACE INDEED AND SEEMED TO BE THE GARDEN OF SOME GREAT PRINCE FOR THROUGH THE VISTAS OF TREES AND SHRUBBERY COULD BE SEEN THE TOWERS OF AN IMMENSE CASTLE BUT AS YET THE ONLY INHABITANT TO GREET THEM WAS THE PECULIAR PERSON JUST MENTIONED
1313-135022-0026 WHO HAD SHAKEN OFF THE GRASP OF THE OFFICERS WITHOUT EFFORT AND WAS NOW TRYING TO PULL THE BATTERED CROWN FROM OFF HIS EYES SHAGGY WHO WAS ALWAYS POLITE HELPED HIM TO DO THIS AND WHEN THE MAN WAS FREE AND COULD SEE AGAIN HE LOOKED AT HIS VISITORS WITH EVIDENT AMAZEMENT
1313-135022-0027 BECAUSE ALL TUBES ARE MADE THAT WAY BUT THIS TUBE IS PRIVATE PROPERTY AND EVERYONE IS FORBIDDEN TO FALL INTO IT WE DIDN'T DO IT ON PURPOSE EXPLAINED BETSY AND POLYCHROME ADDED I AM QUITE SURE THAT RUGGEDO THE NOME KING PUSHED US DOWN THAT TUBE HA
1313-135022-0028 RUGGEDO DID YOU SAY RUGGEDO CRIED THE MAN BECOMING MUCH EXCITED THAT IS WHAT SHE SAID REPLIED SHAGGY AND I BELIEVE SHE IS RIGHT
1313-135022-0029 THEN YOU ARE ENEMIES OF RUGGEDO
1313-135022-0030 CAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HIM AT ALL BUT WE STARTED OUT TO CONQUER HIM WHICH ISN'T AS FRIENDLY AS IT MIGHT BE TRUE AGREED THE MAN HE LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY FROM ONE TO ANOTHER OF THEM FOR A WHILE
1313-135022-0031 NEVER MIND THE FIRE AND PINCERS MY GOOD BROTHERS IT WILL BE BEST TO TAKE THESE STRANGERS TO THE PRIVATE CITIZEN VERY WELL TUBEKINS RESPONDED A VOICE DEEP AND POWERFUL THAT SEEMED TO COME OUT OF THE AIR FOR THE SPEAKER WAS INVISIBLE ALL OUR FRIENDS GAVE A JUMP AT THIS
1313-135022-0032 BUT SOON THEY GAINED COURAGE TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT THE PECULIAR PERSON AS HE WAS A TYPE OF ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY LAND WHOM THEY AFTERWARD MET I WILL TRY TO TELL YOU WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE HIS FACE WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT LACKED EXPRESSION
1313-135022-0033 HE WORE A ROBE OF SCARLET WHICH DID NOT COVER HIS ARMS AND EXTENDED NO LOWER THAN HIS BARE KNEES ON THE BOSOM OF THE ROBE WAS EMBROIDERED A TERRIBLE DRAGON'S HEAD AS HORRIBLE TO LOOK AT AS THE MAN WAS BEAUTIFUL HIS ARMS AND LEGS WERE LEFT BARE
1313-135022-0034 AND THE SKIN OF ONE ARM WAS BRIGHT YELLOW AND THE SKIN OF THE OTHER ARM A VIVID GREEN HE HAD ONE BLUE LEG AND ONE PINK ONE WHILE BOTH HIS FEET WHICH SHOWED THROUGH THE OPEN SANDALS HE WORE WERE JET BLACK
1313-135022-0035 HERE'S ANOTHER OF THEM TUBEKINS LYING IN THE WATER OF THE FOUNTAIN GRACIOUS CRIED BETSY IT MUST BE TIK TOK AND HE'LL DROWN WATER IS A BAD THING FOR HIS CLOCKWORKS ANYWAY AGREED SHAGGY AS WITH ONE ACCORD THEY ALL STARTED FOR THE FOUNTAIN
1313-135022-0036 BUT BEFORE THEY COULD REACH IT INVISIBLE HANDS RAISED TIK TOK FROM THE MARBLE BASIN AND SET HIM UPON HIS FEET BESIDE IT WATER DRIPPING FROM EVERY JOINT OF HIS COPPER BODY
1313-135022-0037 HE SAID AND THEN HIS COPPER JAWS CLICKED TOGETHER AND HE COULD SAY NO MORE HE NEXT MADE AN ATTEMPT TO WALK BUT AFTER SEVERAL AWKWARD TRIALS FOUND HE COULD NOT MOVE HIS JOINTS PEALS OF JEERING LAUGHTER FROM PERSONS UNSEEN GREETED TIK TOK'S FAILURE
1313-135022-0038 AND THE NEW ARRIVALS IN THIS STRANGE LAND FOUND IT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO REALIZE THAT THERE WERE MANY CREATURES AROUND THEM WHO WERE INVISIBLE YET COULD BE HEARD PLAINLY SHALL I WIND HIM UP ASKED BETSY FEELING VERY SORRY FOR TIK TOK
1313-135022-0039 I THINK HIS MACHINERY IS WOUND BUT HE NEEDS OILING REPLIED SHAGGY AT ONCE AN OIL CAN APPEARED BEFORE HIM HELD ON A LEVEL WITH HIS EYES BY SOME UNSEEN HAND SHAGGY TOOK THE CAN AND TRIED TO OIL TIK TOK'S JOINTS
1313-135022-0040 AS IF TO ASSIST HIM A STRONG CURRENT OF WARM AIR WAS DIRECTED AGAINST THE COPPER MAN WHICH QUICKLY DRIED HIM SOON HE WAS ABLE TO SAY
1313-135022-0041 QUITE SMOOTHLY AND HIS JOINTS WORKED FAIRLY WELL COME COMMANDED TUBEKINS AND TURNING HIS BACK UPON THEM HE WALKED UP THE PATH TOWARD THE CASTLE SHALL WE GO ASKED QUEEN ANN UNCERTAINLY
1313-135022-0042 BUT JUST THEN SHE RECEIVED A SHOVE THAT ALMOST PITCHED HER FORWARD ON HER HEAD SO SHE DECIDED TO GO THE OFFICERS WHO HESITATED RECEIVED SEVERAL ENERGETIC KICKS BUT COULD NOT SEE WHO DELIVERED THEM THEREFORE THEY ALSO DECIDED VERY WISELY TO GO
