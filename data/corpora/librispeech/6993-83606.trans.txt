6993-83606-0000 EXAMPLES NO CONSCIOUS MONOTHEISM AND BUT LITTLE IDEA OF IMMATERIALITY DISCOVERABLE STILL LESS ANY MORAL DUALISM OF DEITIES THE GREAT GOOD SPIRIT AND THE GREAT BAD SPIRIT
6993-83606-0001 BEING ALIKE TERMS AND NOTIONS OF FOREIGN IMPORTATION IF WE ACCEPT THE DEFINITION THAT MYTHOLOGY IS THE IDEA OF GOD EXPRESSED IN SYMBOL FIGURE AND NARRATIVE AND ALWAYS STRUGGLING TOWARD A CLEARER UTTERANCE
6993-83606-0002 IT IS WELL NOT ONLY TO TRACE THIS IDEA IN ITS VERY EARLIEST EMBODIMENT IN LANGUAGE BUT ALSO FOR THE SAKE OF COMPARISON
6993-83606-0003 THE REPLY TO THIS IS GIVEN US BY IMMANUEL KANT HE HAS SHOWN THAT OUR REASON DWELLING ON THE FACTS OF EXPERIENCE CONSTANTLY SEEKS THE PRINCIPLES WHICH CONNECT THEM TOGETHER AND ONLY RESTS SATISFIED IN THE CONVICTION
6993-83606-0004 THAT THERE IS A HIGHEST AND FIRST PRINCIPLE WHICH RECONCILES ALL THEIR DISCREPANCIES AND BINDS THEM INTO ONE THIS HE CALLS THE IDEAL OF REASON IT MUST BE TRUE
6993-83606-0005 FOR IT IS EVOLVED FROM THE LAWS OF REASON OUR ONLY TEST OF TRUTH FURTHERMORE THE SENSE OF PERSONALITY AND THE VOICE OF CONSCIENCE ANALYZED TO THEIR SOURCES CAN ONLY BE EXPLAINED BY THE ASSUMPTION OF AN INFINITE PERSONALITY
6993-83606-0006 AND AN ABSOLUTE STANDARD OF RIGHT OR IF TO SOME ALL THIS APPEARS BUT WIRE DRAWN METAPHYSICAL SUBTLETY THEY ARE WELCOME TO THE DEFINITION OF THE REALIST
6993-83606-0007 COULD BE WITHOUT SOME NOTION OF DIVINITY CERTAINLY IN AMERICA NO INSTANCE OF ITS ABSENCE HAS BEEN DISCOVERED OBSCURE GROTESQUE UNWORTHY IT OFTEN WAS BUT EVERYWHERE MAN WAS OPPRESSED WITH A SENSUS NUMINIS
6993-83606-0008 A FEELING THAT INVISIBLE POWERFUL AGENCIES WERE AT WORK AROUND HIM WHO AS THEY WILLED COULD HELP OR HURT HIM IN EVERY HEART WAS AN ALTAR TO THE UNKNOWN GOD NOT THAT IT WAS CUSTOMARY TO ATTACH ANY IDEA OF UNITY TO THESE UNSEEN POWERS
6993-83606-0009 THE SUPPOSITION THAT IN ANCIENT TIMES AND IN VERY UNENLIGHTENED CONDITIONS BEFORE MYTHOLOGY HAD GROWN A MONOTHEISM PREVAILED WHICH AFTERWARDS AT VARIOUS TIMES WAS REVIVED BY REFORMERS
6993-83606-0010 IS A BELIEF THAT SHOULD HAVE PASSED AWAY WHEN THE DELIGHTS OF SAVAGE LIFE AND THE PRAISES OF A STATE OF NATURE CEASED TO BE THE THEMES OF PHILOSOPHERS
6993-83606-0011 THE EXHIBITIONS OF FORCE IN NATURE SEEMED TO THEM THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THAT MYSTERIOUS POWER FELT BY THEIR SELF CONSCIOUSNESS TO COMBINE THESE VARIOUS MANIFESTATIONS AND RECOGNIZE THEM AS THE OPERATIONS OF ONE PERSONALITY
6993-83606-0012 A WORD COMPREHENDING ALL MANIFESTATIONS OF THE UNSEEN WORLD
6993-83606-0013 IT HAS BEEN RENDERED SPIRIT DEMON GOD DEVIL MYSTERY MAGIC BUT COMMONLY AND RATHER ABSURDLY BY THE ENGLISH AND FRENCH MEDICINE
6993-83606-0014 IN THE ALGONKIN DIALECTS THIS WORD IS MANITO AND OKI IN IROQUOIS OKI AND OTKON
6993-83606-0015 THE AZTEC TEOTL THE QUICHUA HUACA AND THE MAYA KU
6993-83606-0016 AND AS IN THIS WORD SUPERNATURAL WE SEE A TRANSFER OF A CONCEPTION OF PLACE AND THAT IT LITERALLY MEANS THAT WHICH IS ABOVE THE NATURAL WORLD SO IN SUCH AS WE CAN ANALYZE OF THESE VAGUE AND PRIMITIVE TERMS THE SAME TROPE APPEARS DISCOVERABLE
6993-83606-0017 WAKAN AS AN ADVERB MEANS ABOVE OKI IS BUT ANOTHER ORTHOGRAPHY FOR OGHEE
6993-83606-0018 BUT HAS ITS ORIGIN IN THE VERY TEXTURE OF THE HUMAN MIND THE HEAVENS THE UPPER REGIONS ARE IN EVERY RELIGION THE SUPPOSED ABODE OF THE DIVINE WHAT IS HIGHER IS ALWAYS THE STRONGER AND THE NOBLER
6993-83606-0019 A SUPERIOR IS ONE WHO IS BETTER THAN WE ARE AND THEREFORE A CHIEFTAIN IN ALGONKIN IS CALLED OGHEE MA THE HIGHER ONE THERE IS MOREOVER A NAIF AND SPONTANEOUS INSTINCT WHICH LEADS MAN IN HIS ECSTASIES OF JOY
6993-83606-0020 AND IN HIS PAROXYSMS OF FEAR OR PAIN TO LIFT HIS HANDS AND EYES TO THE OVERHANGING FIRMAMENT THERE THE SUN AND BRIGHT STARS SOJOURN
6993-83606-0021 AND AS A METAPHOR IN THEIR SPEECHES AND AS A PAINT EXPRESSIVE OF FRIENDLY DESIGN
6993-83606-0022 ALL ORIGINALLY MEANT THE SKY ABOVE AND OUR OWN WORD HEAVEN IS OFTEN EMPLOYED SYNONYMOUSLY WITH GOD THERE IS AT FIRST NO PERSONIFICATION IN THESE EXPRESSIONS THEY EMBRACE ALL UNSEEN AGENCIES
6993-83606-0023 THEY ARE VOID OF PERSONALITY AND YET TO THE ILLOGICAL PRIMITIVE MAN THERE IS NOTHING CONTRADICTORY IN MAKING THEM THE OBJECT OF HIS PRAYERS THE MAYAS HAD LEGIONS OF GODS
6993-83606-0024 WHICH IS THE SAME WORD IN THE VOCATIVE CASE AS THE LATINS CALLED THEIR UNITED DIVINITIES SUPERI THOSE ABOVE SO CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH FOUND THAT THE POWHATANS OF VIRGINIA EMPLOYED THE WORD OKI
6993-83606-0025 ABOVE IN THE SAME SENSE AND IT EVEN HAD PASSED INTO A DEFINITE PERSONIFICATION AMONG THEM IN THE SHAPE OF AN IDOL OF WOOD EVIL FAVOREDLY CARVED IN PURER DIALECTS OF THE ALGONKIN
6993-83606-0026 IT IS ALWAYS INDEFINITE AS IN THE TERMS NIPOON OKI SPIRIT OF SUMMER PIPOON OKI SPIRIT OF WINTER PERHAPS THE WORD WAS INTRODUCED INTO IROQUOIS BY THE HURONS NEIGHBORS AND ASSOCIATES OF THE ALGONKINS
6993-83606-0027 THE HURONS APPLIED IT TO THAT DEMONIAC POWER WHO RULES THE SEASONS OF THE YEAR WHO HOLDS THE WINDS AND THE WAVES IN LEASH
6993-83606-0028 IT REAPPEARS UNDER THE CURIOUS FORM QUAKER DOUBTLESS A CORRUPTION OF THE POWHATAN QUI OKI
6993-83606-0029 WAS GARONHIA WHICH AGAIN TURNS OUT ON EXAMINATION TO BE THEIR COMMON WORD FOR SKY AND AGAIN IN ALL PROBABILITY FROM THE VERBAL ROOT GAR
6993-83606-0030 LORD OF THE SKY PRINCE OF THE AZURE PLANISPHERE HE ABOVE ALL ARE OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE AND BY A STILL BOLDER METAPHOR THE ARAUCANIANS ACCORDING TO MOLINA ENTITLED THEIR GREATEST GOD THE SOUL OF THE SKY
6993-83606-0031 THIS LAST EXPRESSION LEADS TO ANOTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT AS THE PHILOSOPHER PONDERING ON THE WORKINGS OF SELF CONSCIOUSNESS RECOGNIZES THAT VARIOUS PATHWAYS LEAD UP TO GOD
6993-83606-0032 SO THE PRIMITIVE MAN IN FORMING HIS LANGUAGE SOMETIMES TROD ONE SOMETIMES ANOTHER WHATEVER ELSE SCEPTICS HAVE QUESTIONED NO ONE HAS YET PRESUMED TO DOUBT THAT IF A GOD AND A SOUL EXIST AT ALL THEY ARE OF LIKE ESSENCE
6993-83606-0033 THIS FIRM BELIEF HAS LEFT ITS IMPRESS ON LANGUAGE IN THE NAMES DEVISED TO EXPRESS THE SUPERNAL THE SPIRITUAL WORLD
6993-83606-0034 AND AEMI TO BLOW IN GREEK THE WORDS FOR SOUL OR SPIRIT
6993-83606-0035 ALL ARE DIRECTLY FROM VERBAL ROOTS EXPRESSING THE MOTION OF THE WIND OR THE BREATH THE HEBREW WORD RUAH IS TRANSLATED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT SOMETIMES BY WIND SOMETIMES BY SPIRIT SOMETIMES BY BREATH
6993-83606-0036 ETYMOLOGICALLY IN FACT GHOSTS AND GUSTS BREATHS AND BREEZES THE GREAT SPIRIT AND THE GREAT WIND ARE ONE AND THE SAME IT IS EASY TO GUESS THE REASON OF THIS THE SOUL IS THE LIFE THE LIFE IS THE BREATH
6993-83606-0037 INVISIBLE IMPONDERABLE QUICKENING WITH VIGOROUS MOTION SLACKENING IN REST AND SLEEP PASSING QUITE AWAY IN DEATH IT IS THE MOST OBVIOUS SIGN OF LIFE ALL NATIONS GRASPED THE ANALOGY AND IDENTIFIED THE ONE WITH THE OTHER
6993-83606-0038 BUT THE BREATH IS NOTHING BUT WIND HOW EASY THEREFORE TO LOOK UPON THE WIND THAT MOVES UP AND DOWN AND TO AND FRO UPON THE EARTH THAT CARRIES THE CLOUDS ITSELF UNSEEN THAT CALLS FORTH THE TERRIBLE TEMPESTS
6993-83606-0039 AND THE VARIOUS SEASONS AS THE BREATH THE SPIRIT OF GOD AS GOD HIMSELF SO IN THE MOSAIC RECORD OF CREATION IT IS SAID A MIGHTY WIND PASSED OVER THE FORMLESS SEA AND BROUGHT FORTH THE WORLD
6993-83606-0040 THE WIND OF LIVES ARMED WITH THESE ANALOGIES WE TURN TO THE PRIMITIVE TONGUES OF AMERICA AND FIND THEM THERE AS DISTINCT AS IN THE OLD WORLD
6993-83606-0041 IN DAKOTA NIYA IS LITERALLY BREATH FIGURATIVELY LIFE IN NETELA
6993-83606-0042 AND THE REASONING FACULTY THE SUPREME EXISTENCE THEY CALL SILLAM INNUA OWNER OF THE AIR OR OF THE ALL OR SILLAM NELEGA LORD OF THE AIR OR WIND IN THE YAKAMA TONGUE OF OREGON
6993-83606-0043 WKRISHA SIGNIFIES THERE IS WIND WKRISHWIT LIFE WITH THE AZTECS
6993-83606-0044 AND PERSONIFIED IN THEIR MYTHS IT WAS SAID TO HAVE BEEN BORN OF THE BREATH OF TEZCATLIPOCA THEIR HIGHEST DIVINITY WHO HIMSELF IS OFTEN CALLED YOALLIEHECATL
6993-83606-0045 IN THE LEGENDS OF THE QUICHES THE MYSTERIOUS CREATIVE POWER IS HURAKAN A NAME OF NO SIGNIFICATION IN THEIR LANGUAGE ONE WHICH THEIR REMOTE ANCESTORS BROUGHT WITH THEM FROM THE ANTILLES
6993-83606-0046 WHICH FINDS ITS MEANING IN THE ANCIENT TONGUE OF HAITI
6993-83606-0047 OURAGAN ORKAN WAS ADOPTED INTO EUROPEAN MARINE LANGUAGES AS THE NATIVE NAME OF THE TERRIBLE TORNADO
6993-83606-0048 IS TO THIS DAY THE CORRECT TERM IN THEIR LANGUAGE FOR THE TROPICAL WHIRLWIND AND THE NATIVES OF PANAMA WORSHIPPED THE SAME PHENOMENON
6993-83606-0049 NONE HAVE TRACED IT TO ITS TRUE SOURCE THE FACTS OF METEOROLOGY HAVE BEEN THOUGHT ALL SUFFICIENT FOR A SOLUTION AS IF MAN EVER DID OR EVER COULD DRAW THE IDEA OF GOD FROM NATURE IN THE IDENTITY OF WIND WITH BREATH
6993-83606-0050 OF BREATH WITH LIFE OF LIFE WITH SOUL OF SOUL WITH GOD LIES THE FAR DEEPER AND FAR TRUER REASON WHOSE INSENSIBLE DEVELOPMENT I HAVE HERE TRACED IN OUTLINE INDEED BUT CONFIRMED BY THE EVIDENCE OF LANGUAGE ITSELF
6993-83606-0051 LET NONE OF THESE EXPRESSIONS HOWEVER BE CONSTRUED TO PROVE THE DISTINCT RECOGNITION OF ONE SUPREME BEING OF MONOTHEISM EITHER AS DISPLAYED IN THE ONE PERSONAL DEFINITE GOD OF THE SEMITIC RACES
6993-83606-0052 OR IN THE DIM PANTHEISTIC SENSE OF THE BRAHMINS THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE INSTANCE ON THE AMERICAN CONTINENT THE MISSIONARIES FOUND NO WORD IN ANY OF THEIR LANGUAGES FIT TO INTERPRET DEUS GOD
6993-83606-0053 HOW COULD THEY EXPECT IT THE ASSOCIATIONS WE ATTACH TO THAT NAME ARE THE ACCUMULATED FRUITS OF NIGH TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF CHRISTIANITY THE PHRASES GOOD SPIRIT GREAT SPIRIT AND SIMILAR ONES
6993-83606-0054 HAVE OCCASIONED ENDLESS DISCREPANCIES IN THE MINDS OF TRAVELLERS IN MOST INSTANCES THEY ARE ENTIRELY OF MODERN ORIGIN COINED AT THE SUGGESTION OF MISSIONARIES APPLIED TO THE WHITE MAN'S GOD
